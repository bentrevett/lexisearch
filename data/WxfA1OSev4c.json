  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.920\n The following is a conversation with Alex Filipenko, an astrophysicist and professor\n\n00:04.920 --> 00:07.100\n of astronomy from Berkeley.\n\n00:07.100 --> 00:12.640\n He was a member of both the Supernova Cosmology Project and the HiZ Supernova Search Team\n\n00:12.640 --> 00:18.680\n which used observations of the extragalactic supernova to discover that the universe is\n\n00:18.680 --> 00:23.800\n accelerating and that this implies the existence of dark energy.\n\n00:23.800 --> 00:28.920\n This discovery resulted in the 2011 NOVA Prize for Physics.\n\n00:28.920 --> 00:34.120\n Outside of his groundbreaking research, he is a great science communicator and is one\n\n00:34.120 --> 00:37.680\n of the most widely admired educators in the world.\n\n00:37.680 --> 00:43.160\n I really enjoyed this conversation and am sure Alex will be back again in the future.\n\n00:43.160 --> 00:47.440\n Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n00:47.440 --> 00:53.100\n Neuro, the maker of functional, sugar free gum and mints that I used to give my brain\n\n00:53.100 --> 00:55.560\n a quick caffeine boost.\n\n00:55.560 --> 01:01.360\n BetterHelp, an online therapy with a licensed professional, Masterclass, online courses\n\n01:01.360 --> 01:07.240\n that I enjoy from some of the most amazing humans in history, and CashApp, the app I\n\n01:07.240 --> 01:09.440\n use to send money to friends.\n\n01:09.440 --> 01:14.080\n Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:14.080 --> 01:20.160\n As a side note, let me say that as we talk about in this conversation, the objects that\n\n01:20.160 --> 01:26.760\n populate the universe are both awe inspiring and terrifying in their capacity to create\n\n01:26.760 --> 01:28.920\n and to destroy us.\n\n01:28.920 --> 01:34.820\n Solar flares and asteroids lurking in the darkness of space threaten our humble, fragile\n\n01:34.820 --> 01:37.460\n existence here on Earth.\n\n01:37.460 --> 01:44.040\n In the chaos, tension, conflict, and social division of 2020, it's easy to forget just\n\n01:44.040 --> 01:50.120\n how lucky we humans are to be here, and with a bit of hard work, maybe one day, we'll\n\n01:50.120 --> 01:53.520\n venture out towards the stars.\n\n01:53.520 --> 01:57.600\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with Five Stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n01:57.600 --> 02:03.840\n follow on Spotify, support on

biggest possible thing, the universe.\n\n02:12.840 --> 02:16.040\n Will the universe expand forever or collapse on itself?\n\n02:16.040 --> 02:18.180\n Well, you know, that's a great question.\n\n02:18.180 --> 02:24.320\n It's one of the big questions of cosmology, and of course, we have evidence that the matter\n\n02:24.320 --> 02:28.140\n density is sufficiently low that the universe will expand forever.\n\n02:28.140 --> 02:33.900\n But not only that, there's this weird repulsive effect, we call it dark energy for want of\n\n02:33.900 --> 02:38.860\n a better term, and it appears to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.\n\n02:38.860 --> 02:44.920\n So if that continues, the universe will expand forever, but it need not necessarily continue.\n\n02:44.920 --> 02:51.480\n It could reverse sign, in which case the universe could, in principle, collapse at some point\n\n02:51.480 --> 02:53.200\n in the far, far future.\n\n02:53.200 --> 02:58.480\n So in terms of investment advice, if you were to give me and then to bet all my money on\n\n02:58.480 --> 03:01.320\n one or the other, where does your intuition currently lie?\n\n03:01.320 --> 03:05.900\n Well, right now, I would say that it would expand forever because I think that the dark\n\n03:05.900 --> 03:11.100\n energy is likely to be just quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.\n\n03:11.100 --> 03:15.960\n The vacuum zero energy state is not a state of zero energy.\n\n03:15.960 --> 03:21.240\n That is, the ground state is a state of some elevated energy which has a repulsive effect\n\n03:21.240 --> 03:22.240\n to it.\n\n03:22.240 --> 03:27.080\n And that will never go away because it's not something that changes with time.\n\n03:27.080 --> 03:31.820\n So if the universe is accelerating now, it will forever continue to do so.\n\n03:31.820 --> 03:36.080\n And yet, I mean, you so effortlessly mentioned dark energy.\n\n03:36.080 --> 03:39.040\n Do we have any understanding of what the heck that thing is?\n\n03:39.040 --> 03:40.280\n Well, not really.\n\n03:40.280 --> 03:44.180\n But we're getting progressively better observational constraints.\n\n03:44.180 --> 03:50.160\n So different theories of what it might be predict different sorts of behavior for the\n\n03:50.160 --> 03:51.900\n evolution of the universe.\n\n03:51.900 --> 03:55.880\n And we've been measuring the evolution of the universe now.\n\n03:55.880 --> 04:02.780\n And the data appear to agree with the predictions of a constant density vacuum energy, a zero\n\n04:02.780 --> 04:05.280\n point energy.\n\n04:05.280 --> 04:12.680\n But one can't prove that that's what it is because one would have to show that the measured\n\n04:12.680 --> 04:17.280\n numbers agree with the predictions to an arbitrary number of decimal places.\n\n04:17.280 --> 04:23.120\n And of course, even if you've got 8, 9, 10, 12 decimal places, what if in the 13th one,\n\n04:23.120 --> 04:27.360\n the measurements significantly differ from the prediction?\n\n04:27.360 --> 04:35.400\n Then the dark energy isn't this vacuum state, ground state energy of the vacuum.\n\n04:35.400 --> 04:40.320\n And so then it could be some sort of a field, some sort of a new energy, a little bit like\n\n04:40.320 --> 04:47.480\n light, like electromagnetism, but very different from light, that fills space.\n\n04:47.480 --> 04:52.660\n And that type of energy could in principle change in the distant future.\n\n04:52.660 --> 04:56.440\n It could become gravitationally attractive for all we know.\n\n04:56.440 --> 05:00.880\n There is a historical precedent to that, and that is that the inflation with which the\n\n05:00.880 --> 05:07.120\n universe began when the universe was just a tiny blink of an eye old, a trillionth of\n\n05:07.120 --> 05:11.320\n a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, the universe went whoosh, it exponentially\n\n05:11.320 --> 05:12.680\n expanded.\n\n05:12.680 --> 05:19.000\n That dark energy like substance, we call it the inflaton, that which inflated the universe,\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.680\n later decayed into more or less normal gravitationally attractive matter.\n\n05:24.680 --> 05:31.720\n So the exponential early expansion of the universe did transition to a deceleration,\n\n05:31.720 --> 05:35.080\n which then dominated the universe for about nine billion years.\n\n05:35.080 --> 05:42.880\n And now this small amount of dark energy started causing an acceleration about five billion\n\n05:42.880 --> 05:43.880\n years ago.\n\n05:43.880 --> 05:48.280\n And whether that will continue or not is something that we'd like to answer, but I don't know\n\n05:48.280 --> 05:50.520\n that we will anytime soon.\n\n05:50.520 --> 05:56.240\n So there could be this interesting field that we don't yet understand that's morphing over\n\n05:56.240 --> 05:59.480\n time, that's changing the way the universe is expanding.\n\n05:59.480 --> 06:06.760\n I mean, it's funny that you were thinking through this rigorously like an experimentalist.\n\n06:06.760 --> 06:11.260\n But what about like the fundamental physics of dark energy?\n\n06:11.260 --> 06:20.680\n Is there any understanding of what the heck it is, or is this the kind of the god of the\n\n06:20.680 --> 06:22.880\n gaps or the field of the gaps?\n\n06:22.880 --> 06:26.800\n So like there must be something there because of what we're observing.\n\n06:26.800 --> 06:35.440\n I'm very much a person who believes that there's always a cause, you know, there are no miracles\n\n06:35.440 --> 06:39.480\n of a supernatural nature, okay?\n\n06:39.480 --> 06:45.360\n So I mean, there are two broad categories, either it's the vacuum zero point energy,\n\n06:45.360 --> 06:50.440\n or it's some sort of a new energy field that pervades the universe.\n\n06:50.440 --> 06:55.960\n The latter could change with time, the former, the vacuum energy cannot.\n\n06:55.960 --> 07:00.960\n So if it turns out that it's one of these new fields, and there are many, many possibilities,\n\n07:00.960 --> 07:06.360\n they go by the name of quintessence and things like that, but there are many categories of\n\n07:06.360 --> 07:14.760\n those sorts of fields, we try with data to rule them out by comparing the actual measurements\n\n07:14.760 --> 07:16.440\n with the predictions.\n\n07:16.440 --> 07:22.000\n And some have been ruled out, but many, many others remain to be tested.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:28.160\n And the data just have to become a lot better before we can rule out most of them and become\n\n07:28.160 --> 07:31.960\n reasonably convinced that this is a vacuum energy.\n\n07:31.960 --> 07:35.760\n So there is hypotheses for different fields, like with names and stuff like that?\n\n07:35.760 --> 07:40.160\n Yeah, you know, generically quintessence, like the Aristotelian fifth essence, but there\n\n07:40.160 --> 07:42.880\n are many, many versions of quintessence.\n\n07:42.880 --> 07:48.520\n There's K essence, there's even ideas that, you know, this isn't something from within\n\n07:48.520 --> 07:54.240\n this dark energy, but rather, there are a bunch of, say, bubble universes surrounding\n\n07:54.240 --> 08:00.560\n our universe, and this whole idea of the multiverse is not some crazy madman type idea anymore.\n\n08:00.560 --> 08:04.860\n It's, you know, real card carrying physicists are seriously considering this possibility\n\n08:04.860 --> 08:06.240\n of a multiverse.\n\n08:06.240 --> 08:10.640\n And some types of multiverses could have, you know, a bunch of bubbles on the outside,\n\n08:10.640 --> 08:18.600\n which gravitationally act outward on our bubble because gravity or gravitons, the quantum\n\n08:18.600 --> 08:24.300\n particle that is thought to carry gravity, is thought to traverse the bulk, the space\n\n08:24.300 --> 08:27.080\n between these different little bubble membranes and stuff.\n\n08:27.080 --> 08:31.580\n And so it's conceivable that these other universes are pulling outward on us.\n\n08:31.580 --> 08:38.040\n That's not a favored explanation right now, but really, nothing has been ruled out.\n\n08:38.040 --> 08:41.680\n No class of models has been ruled out completely.\n\n08:41.680 --> 08:46.000\n Certain examples within classes of models have been ruled out.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:52.000\n But in general, I think we still have really a lot to learn about what's causing this\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:58.560\n observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe, be it dark energy or some forces\n\n08:58.560 --> 09:05.760\n from the outside, or perhaps, you know, I guess it's conceivable that, and sometimes\n\n09:05.760 --> 09:12.760\n I wake up in the middle of the night screaming, that dark energy, that which causes the acceleration,\n\n09:12.760 --> 09:18.160\n and dark matter, that which causes galaxies and clusters of galaxies to be bound gravitationally\n\n09:18.160 --> 09:21.400\n even though there's not enough visible matter to do so.\n\n09:21.400 --> 09:28.360\n Maybe these are our 20th and 21st century Ptolemaic epicycles.\n\n09:28.360 --> 09:32.820\n So Ptolemy had a geocentric and Aristotelian view of the world.\n\n09:32.820 --> 09:34.520\n Everything goes around Earth.\n\n09:34.520 --> 09:40.540\n But in order to explain the backward motion of planets among the stars that happens every\n\n09:40.540 --> 09:45.480\n year or two, or sometimes several times a year for Mercury and Venus, you needed the\n\n09:45.480 --> 09:51.080\n planets to go around in little circles called epicycles, which themselves then went around\n\n09:51.080 --> 09:52.080\n Earth.\n\n09:52.080 --> 09:58.840\n And in this part of the epicycle where the planet is going in the direction opposite\n\n09:58.840 --> 10:04.360\n to the direction of the overall epicycle, it can appear in projection to be going backward\n\n10:04.360 --> 10:08.040\n among the stars, so called retrograde motion.\n\n10:08.040 --> 10:10.240\n And it was a brilliant mathematical scheme.\n\n10:10.240 --> 10:16.480\n In fact, he could have added epicycles on top of epicycles and reproduced the observed\n\n10:16.480 --> 10:19.740\n positions of planets to arbitrary accuracy.\n\n10:19.740 --> 10:24.760\n And this is really the beginning of what we now call Fourier analysis, right?\n\n10:24.760 --> 10:31.680\n Any periodic function can be represented by a sum of sines and cosines of different periods,\n\n10:31.680 --> 10:33.560\n amplitudes, and phases.\n\n10:33.560 --> 10:36.360\n So it could have worked arbitrarily well.\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:42.080\n But other data show that, in fact, Earth is going around the sun.\n\n10:42.080 --> 10:49.420\n So our dark energy and dark matter, just these band aids that we now have to try to explain\n\n10:49.420 --> 10:53.160\n the data, but they're just completely wrong.\n\n10:53.160 --> 10:54.760\n That's a possibility as well.\n\n10:54.760 --> 11:00.760\n And as a scientist, I have to be open to that possibility as an open minded scientist.\n\n11:00.760 --> 11:05.240\n How do you put yourself in the mindset of somebody that, or majority of the scientific\n\n11:05.240 --> 11:10.820\n community or majority of people believe that the Earth, everything rotates around Earth?\n\n11:10.820 --> 11:21.200\n How do you put yourself in that mindset and then take a leap to propose a model that the\n\n11:21.200 --> 11:25.760\n sun is, in fact, at the center of the solar system?\n\n11:25.760 --> 11:26.760\n Sure.\n\n11:26.760 --> 11:32.640\n I mean, so that puts us back in the shoes of Copernicus, right, 500 years ago, where\n\n11:32.640 --> 11:39.400\n he had this philosophical preference for the sun being the dominant body in what we now\n\n11:39.400 --> 11:41.440\n call the solar system.\n\n11:41.440 --> 11:48.460\n The observational evidence in terms of the measured positions of planets was not better\n\n11:48.460 --> 11:53.460\n explained by the heliocentric, sun centered system.\n\n11:53.460 --> 12:01.240\n It's just that Copernicus saw that the sun is the source of all our light and heat, and\n\n12:01.240 --> 12:03.920\n he knew from other studies that it's far away.\n\n12:03.920 --> 12:08.360\n So the fact that it appears as big as the moon means it's actually way, way bigger because\n\n12:08.360 --> 12:12.800\n even at that time, it was known that the sun is much farther away than the moon.\n\n12:12.800 --> 12:16.440\n So he just felt, wow, it's big, it's bright.\n\n12:16.440 --> 12:18.680\n What if it's the central thing?\n\n12:18.680 --> 12:26.720\n But the observed positions of planets at the time in the early to mid 16th century under\n\n12:26.720 --> 12:32.320\n the heliocentric system was not a better match, at least not a significantly better match\n\n12:32.320 --> 12:36.840\n than Ptolemy's system, which was quite accurate and lasted 1500 years.\n\n12:36.840 --> 12:37.840\n Yeah.\n\n12:37.840 --> 12:45.280\n That's so fascinating to think that the philosophical predispositions that you bring to the table\n\n12:45.280 --> 12:46.280\n are essential.\n\n12:46.280 --> 12:50.600\n So like you have to have a young person come along that has a weird infatuation with the\n\n12:50.600 --> 12:51.600\n sun.\n\n12:51.600 --> 12:52.600\n Yeah.\n\n12:52.600 --> 12:58.680\n That like almost philosophically is like however their upbringing is, they're more ready for\n\n12:58.680 --> 13:02.560\n whatever the more the simpler answer is.\n\n13:02.560 --> 13:03.560\n Right.\n\n13:03.560 --> 13:07.160\n Oh, that's kind of sad.\n\n13:07.160 --> 13:12.640\n It's a sad from an individual descendant of eight perspective because then that means\n\n13:12.640 --> 13:19.400\n like me, you as a scientist, you're stuck with whatever the heck philosophies you brought\n\n13:19.400 --> 13:25.140\n to the table and you might be almost completely unable to think outside this particular box\n\n13:25.140 --> 13:26.140\n you've built.\n\n13:26.140 --> 13:27.140\n Right.\n\n13:27.140 --> 13:29.540\n This is why I'm saying that, you know, as an objective scientist, one needs to have\n\n13:29.540 --> 13:34.040\n an open mind to crazy sounding new ideas.\n\n13:34.040 --> 13:40.320\n And even Copernicus was very much a man of his time and dedicated his work to the Pope.\n\n13:40.320 --> 13:43.120\n He still used circular orbits.\n\n13:43.120 --> 13:48.980\n The sun was a little bit off center, it turns out, and a slightly off center circle looks\n\n13:48.980 --> 13:52.220\n like a slightly eccentric elliptical orbit.\n\n13:52.220 --> 13:58.000\n So then when Kepler, in fact, showed that the orbits are actually in general ellipses,\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:07.760\n not circles, the reason that he needed Tuco Brahe's really great data to show that distinction\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:13.520\n was that a slightly off center circle is not much different from a slightly eccentric ellipse.\n\n14:13.520 --> 14:20.480\n And so there wasn't much difference between Kepler's view and Copernicus's view and Kepler\n\n14:20.480 --> 14:24.640\n needed the better data, Tuco Brahe's data.\n\n14:24.640 --> 14:33.440\n And so that's, again, a great example of science and observations and experiments working together\n\n14:33.440 --> 14:36.960\n with hypotheses and they kind of bounce off each other.\n\n14:36.960 --> 14:40.720\n They play off of each other and you continually need more observations.\n\n14:40.720 --> 14:49.320\n And it wasn't until Galileo's work around 1610 that actual evidence for the heliocentric\n\n14:49.320 --> 14:51.040\n hypothesis emerged.\n\n14:51.040 --> 14:57.100\n It came in the form of Venus, the planet Venus, going through all of the possible phases from\n\n14:57.100 --> 15:03.840\n new to crescent to quarter to gibbous to full to waning gibbous, third quarter waning crescent,\n\n15:03.840 --> 15:05.020\n and then new again.\n\n15:05.020 --> 15:10.560\n It turns out in the Ptolemaic system with Venus between Earth and the sun, but always\n\n15:10.560 --> 15:17.560\n roughly in the direction of the sun, you could only get the new and crescent phases of Venus.\n\n15:17.560 --> 15:21.600\n But the observations showed a full set of phases.\n\n15:21.600 --> 15:26.620\n And moreover, when Venus was gibbous or full, that meant it was on the far side of the sun.\n\n15:26.620 --> 15:31.320\n That meant it was farther from Earth than when it's crescent, so it should appear smaller\n\n15:31.320 --> 15:33.000\n and indeed it did.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.800\n So that was the nail in the coffin in a sense.\n\n15:36.800 --> 15:42.460\n And then Galileo's other great observation was that Jupiter has moons going around it,\n\n15:42.460 --> 15:44.400\n the four Galilean satellites.\n\n15:44.400 --> 15:49.440\n And even though Jupiter moves through space, so too do the moons go with it.\n\n15:49.440 --> 15:53.820\n So first of all, Earth is not the only thing that has other things going around it.\n\n15:53.820 --> 16:01.360\n And secondly, Earth could be moving as Jupiter does and things would move with it.\n\n16:01.360 --> 16:04.720\n We wouldn't fly off the surface and our moon wouldn't be left behind and all this kind\n\n16:04.720 --> 16:05.720\n of stuff.\n\n16:05.720 --> 16:11.000\n So that was a big breakthrough as well, but it wasn't as definitive in my opinion as\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.680\n the phases of Venus.\n\n16:13.680 --> 16:17.520\n Sometimes I'm revealing my ignorance, but I didn't realize how much data they were working\n\n16:17.520 --> 16:20.240\n with.\n\n16:20.240 --> 16:27.020\n So it wasn't Einstein or Freud thinking in theories.\n\n16:27.020 --> 16:31.480\n It was a lot of data and you're playing with it and seeing how to make sense of it.\n\n16:31.480 --> 16:36.920\n So it isn't just coming up with completely abstract thought experiments.\n\n16:36.920 --> 16:37.920\n It's looking at the data.\n\n16:37.920 --> 16:38.920\n Sure.\n\n16:38.920 --> 16:40.400\n And you look at Newton's great work, right?\n\n16:40.400 --> 16:47.480\n The Principia, it was based in part on Galileo's observations of balls rolling down inclined\n\n16:47.480 --> 16:53.240\n planes, supposedly falling off the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but that's probably apocryphal.\n\n16:53.240 --> 17:04.040\n In any case, the Roman Catholic Church did history a favor, not that I'm condoning them,\n\n17:04.040 --> 17:10.440\n but they placed Galileo under house arrest and that gave Galileo time to publish, to\n\n17:10.440 --> 17:15.640\n assemble and publish the results of his experiments that he had done decades earlier.\n\n17:15.640 --> 17:21.400\n It's not clear he would have had time to do that, had he not been under house arrest.\n\n17:21.400 --> 17:27.520\n And so Newton, of course, very much used Galileo's observations.\n\n17:27.520 --> 17:34.080\n Let me ask the old Russian overly philosophical question about death.\n\n17:34.080 --> 17:36.640\n So we're talking about the expanding universe.\n\n17:36.640 --> 17:37.640\n Sure.\n\n17:37.640 --> 17:42.680\n How do you think human civilization will come to an end if we avoid the near term issues\n\n17:42.680 --> 17:45.400\n we're having?\n\n17:45.400 --> 17:47.240\n Will it be our sun burning out?\n\n17:47.240 --> 17:48.240\n Will it be comets?\n\n17:48.240 --> 17:49.240\n Oh, okay.\n\n17:49.240 --> 17:52.560\n Will it be, what is it?\n\n17:52.560 --> 17:58.360\n Do you think we have a shot at reaching the heat death of the universe?\n\n17:58.360 --> 17:59.360\n Yeah.\n\n17:59.360 --> 18:07.520\n So we're going to leave out the anthropogenic causes of our potential destruction, which\n\n18:07.520 --> 18:14.460\n I actually think are greater than the celestial causes.\n\n18:14.460 --> 18:18.560\n So if we get lucky and intelligent, I don't know.\n\n18:18.560 --> 18:23.680\n So no way will we as humans reach the heat death of the universe.\n\n18:23.680 --> 18:30.160\n It's conceivable that machines, which I think will be our evolutionary descendants, might\n\n18:30.160 --> 18:35.120\n reach that, although even they will have less and less energy with which to work as time\n\n18:35.120 --> 18:40.960\n progresses because eventually even the lowest mass stars burn out, although it takes them\n\n18:40.960 --> 18:44.000\n trillions of years to do so.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:52.480\n So the point is that certainly on Earth, there are other celestial threats, existential threats,\n\n18:52.480 --> 18:57.000\n comets, exploding stars, the sun burning out.\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:02.360\n So we will definitely need to move away from our solar system to other solar systems.\n\n19:02.360 --> 19:10.000\n And then the question is, can they keep on propagating to other planetary systems sufficiently\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.800\n long?\n\n19:11.800 --> 19:20.800\n In our own solar system, the sun burning out is not the immediate existential threat.\n\n19:20.800 --> 19:25.400\n That'll happen in about five billion years when it becomes a red giant, although I should\n\n19:25.400 --> 19:30.240\n hasten to add that within the next one or two billion years, the sun will have brightened\n\n19:30.240 --> 19:38.520\n enough that unless there are compensatory atmospheric changes, the oceans will evaporate\n\n19:38.520 --> 19:39.520\n away.\n\n19:39.520 --> 19:44.320\n They're going to need much less carbon dioxide for the temperatures to be maintained roughly\n\n19:44.320 --> 19:47.840\n at their present temperature, and plants wouldn't like that very much.\n\n19:47.840 --> 19:51.520\n So you can't lower the carbon dioxide content too much.\n\n19:51.520 --> 19:56.240\n So within one or two billion years, probably the oceans will evaporate away.\n\n19:56.240 --> 20:02.840\n But on a sooner time scale than that, I would say an asteroid collision leading to a potential\n\n20:02.840 --> 20:08.720\n mass extinction, or at least an extinction of complex beings such as ourselves that require\n\n20:08.720 --> 20:19.040\n quite special conditions unlike cockroaches and amoebas to survive, one of these civilization\n\n20:19.040 --> 20:25.000\n changing asteroids is only one kilometer or so in diameter and bigger, and a true mass\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.880\n extinction event is 10 kilometers or larger.\n\n20:28.880 --> 20:34.560\n Now it's true that we can find and track the orbits of asteroids that might be headed toward\n\n20:34.560 --> 20:39.860\n Earth, and if we find them 50 or 100 years before they impact us, then clever applied\n\n20:39.860 --> 20:43.440\n physicists and engineers can figure out ways to deflect them.\n\n20:43.440 --> 20:48.640\n But at some point, some comet will come in from the deep freeze of the solar system,\n\n20:48.640 --> 20:52.000\n and there we have very little warning, months to a year.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.120\n What's the deep freeze, sorry to interrupt.\n\n20:54.120 --> 20:57.080\n The deep freeze is sort of out beyond Neptune.\n\n20:57.080 --> 21:03.440\n There's this thing called the Kuiper Belt, and it consists of a bunch of dirty ice balls\n\n21:03.440 --> 21:04.920\n or icy dirt balls.\n\n21:04.920 --> 21:08.920\n It's the source of the comets that occasionally come close to the Sun.\n\n21:08.920 --> 21:13.760\n And then there's an even bigger area called the Scattered Disk, which is sort of a big\n\n21:13.760 --> 21:17.840\n doughnut surrounding the solar system way out there from which other comets come.\n\n21:17.840 --> 21:25.840\n And then there's the Oort Cloud, W O O R T after Jan Oort, a Dutch astrophysicist, and\n\n21:25.840 --> 21:31.080\n it's the better part of a light year away from the Sun, so a good fraction of the distance\n\n21:31.080 --> 21:37.640\n to the nearest star, but that's like a trillion or 10 trillion comet like objects that occasionally\n\n21:37.640 --> 21:41.560\n get disturbed by a passing star or whatever, and most of them go flying out of the solar\n\n21:41.560 --> 21:46.960\n system, but some go toward the Sun, and they come in with little warning.\n\n21:46.960 --> 21:53.240\n By the time we can see them, they're only a year or two away from us.\n\n21:53.240 --> 21:59.080\n And moreover, not only is it hard to determine their trajectories sufficiently accurately\n\n21:59.080 --> 22:07.040\n to know whether they'll hit a tiny thing like Earth, but outgassing from the comet of gases\n\n22:07.040 --> 22:13.600\n when the ices sublimate, that outgassing can change the trajectory just because of conservation\n\n22:13.600 --> 22:14.600\n of momentum, right?\n\n22:14.600 --> 22:15.920\n It's the rocket effect.\n\n22:15.920 --> 22:19.100\n Gases go out in one direction, the object moves in the other direction.\n\n22:19.100 --> 22:25.000\n And so since we can't predict how much outgassing there will be and in exactly what direction\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:30.400\n because these things are tumbling and rotating and stuff, it's hard to predict the trajectory\n\n22:30.400 --> 22:33.280\n with sufficient accuracy to know that it will hit.\n\n22:33.280 --> 22:38.760\n And you certainly don't want to deflect a comet that would have missed but you thought\n\n22:38.760 --> 22:41.980\n it was going to hit and end up having it hit.\n\n22:41.980 --> 22:47.200\n That would be like the ultimate Charlie Brown goat instead of trying to be the hero, right?\n\n22:47.200 --> 22:50.960\n He ended up being the goat.\n\n22:50.960 --> 22:58.960\n What would you do if it seemed like in a matter of months that there is some nonzero probability,\n\n22:58.960 --> 23:02.480\n maybe a high probability that there will be a collision?\n\n23:02.480 --> 23:06.680\n So from a scientific perspective, from an engineering perspective, I imagine you would\n\n23:06.680 --> 23:10.520\n actually be in the room of people deciding what to do.\n\n23:10.520 --> 23:12.680\n What uh, philosophically too.\n\n23:12.680 --> 23:13.720\n It's a tough one, right?\n\n23:13.720 --> 23:19.680\n Because if you only have a few months, that's not much time in which to deflect it.\n\n23:19.680 --> 23:27.920\n Early detection and early action are key because when it's far away, you only have to deflect\n\n23:27.920 --> 23:30.320\n it by a tiny little angle.\n\n23:30.320 --> 23:37.160\n And then by the time it reaches us, the perpendicular motion is big enough to miss Earth.\n\n23:37.160 --> 23:41.520\n All you need is one radius or one diameter of the Earth, right?\n\n23:41.520 --> 23:47.540\n That actually means that all you would need to do is slow it down so it arrives four minutes\n\n23:47.540 --> 23:54.320\n later or speed it up so it arrives four minutes earlier and Earth will have moved through\n\n23:54.320 --> 23:56.400\n one radius in that time.\n\n23:56.400 --> 23:57.400\n So it doesn't take much.\n\n23:57.400 --> 24:02.600\n But you can imagine if a thing is about to hit you, you have to deflect it 90 degrees\n\n24:02.600 --> 24:03.600\n or more, right?\n\n24:03.600 --> 24:07.160\n You know, and you don't have much time to do so and you have to slow it down or speed\n\n24:07.160 --> 24:09.280\n it up a lot if that's what you're trying to do to it.\n\n24:09.280 --> 24:14.680\n And so decades is sufficient time, but months is not sufficient time.\n\n24:14.680 --> 24:20.200\n So at that point, I would think the name of the game would be to try to predict where\n\n24:20.200 --> 24:22.560\n it would hit.\n\n24:22.560 --> 24:33.440\n And if it's in a heavily populated region, try to start an orderly evacuation perhaps.\n\n24:33.440 --> 24:37.720\n But you know, that might cause just so much panic that I'm, how would you do with New\n\n24:37.720 --> 24:41.400\n York City or Los Angeles or something like that, right?\n\n24:41.400 --> 24:48.360\n I might have a different opinion a year ago, I'm a bit disheartened by, you know, in the\n\n24:48.360 --> 24:54.760\n movies, there's always extreme competence from the government.\n\n24:54.760 --> 24:55.760\n Competence, yeah.\n\n24:55.760 --> 24:56.760\n Competence, yeah.\n\n24:56.760 --> 24:59.720\n But we expect extreme incompetence, if anything, right?\n\n24:59.720 --> 25:00.720\n Yes, no.\n\n25:00.720 --> 25:02.240\n So I'm quite disappointed.\n\n25:02.240 --> 25:07.000\n But sort of from a medical perspective, I think you're saying there, and a scientific\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:13.080\n one, it's almost better to get better and better, maybe telescopes and data collection\n\n25:13.080 --> 25:17.920\n to be able to predict the movement of these things, or like come up with totally new technologies\n\n25:17.920 --> 25:24.240\n that you can imagine actually sending out, like probes out there to be able to sort of\n\n25:24.240 --> 25:29.680\n almost have little finger sensors throughout our solar system to be able to detect stuff.\n\n25:29.680 --> 25:30.680\n Well, that's right.\n\n25:30.680 --> 25:35.640\n Yeah, monitoring the asteroid belt is very important and 99% of the so called near earth\n\n25:35.640 --> 25:39.200\n objects ultimately come from the asteroid belt.\n\n25:39.200 --> 25:43.640\n And so there we can track the trajectories and even if there's a close encounter between\n\n25:43.640 --> 25:48.640\n two asteroids which deflects one of them toward earth, it's unlikely to be on a collision\n\n25:48.640 --> 25:53.720\n course with earth in the immediate future, it's more like tens of years, so that gives\n\n25:53.720 --> 25:54.860\n us time.\n\n25:54.860 --> 26:00.840\n But we would need to improve our ability to detect the objects that come in from a great\n\n26:00.840 --> 26:01.840\n distance.\n\n26:01.840 --> 26:09.720\n And those are much rarer, the comets come in, 1% of the collisions perhaps are with\n\n26:09.720 --> 26:16.380\n comets that come in without any warning hardly.\n\n26:16.380 --> 26:23.280\n So that might be more like a billion or two billion years before one of those hits us.\n\n26:23.280 --> 26:28.240\n So maybe we have to worry about the sun getting brighter on that time scale.\n\n26:28.240 --> 26:34.760\n I mean, there's the possibility that a star will explode near us in the next couple of\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:35.760\n billion years.\n\n26:35.760 --> 26:46.680\n But over the course of the history of life on earth, the estimates are that maybe only\n\n26:46.680 --> 26:54.520\n one of the mass extinctions was caused by a star blowing up in particular, a special\n\n26:54.520 --> 27:03.080\n kind called a gamma ray burst, and I think it's the Ordovician\u2013Silurian extinction\n\n27:03.080 --> 27:09.240\n 420 or so, 440 million years ago that is speculated to have come from one of these particular\n\n27:09.240 --> 27:12.240\n types of exploding stars called gamma ray bursts.\n\n27:12.240 --> 27:15.680\n But even there, the evidence is circumstantial.\n\n27:15.680 --> 27:20.800\n So those kinds of existential threats are reasonably rare.\n\n27:20.800 --> 27:28.040\n The greater danger I think is civilization changing events where it's a much smaller\n\n27:28.040 --> 27:37.200\n asteroid, which those are harder to detect, or a giant solar flare that shorts out the\n\n27:37.200 --> 27:40.880\n grid in all of North America, let's say.\n\n27:40.880 --> 27:46.560\n Now, astronomers are monitoring the sun 24 seven with various satellites and we can tell\n\n27:46.560 --> 27:52.840\n when there's a flare or a coronal mass ejection and we can tell that in a day or two, a giant\n\n27:52.840 --> 27:58.080\n bundle of energetic particles will arrive and twang the magnetic field of earth and\n\n27:58.080 --> 28:03.120\n send all kinds of currents through long distance power lines and that's what shorts out the\n\n28:03.120 --> 28:09.800\n transformers and transformers are expensive and hard to replace and hard to transport\n\n28:09.800 --> 28:10.800\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n28:10.800 --> 28:18.640\n So if we can warn the power companies and they can shut down the grid before the big\n\n28:18.640 --> 28:21.360\n bundle of particle hits, then we will have mitigated much of this.\n\n28:21.360 --> 28:27.080\n Now for a big enough bundle of particles, you can get short circuits even over small\n\n28:27.080 --> 28:32.680\n distance scales, so not everything will be saved, but at least the whole grid might not\n\n28:32.680 --> 28:33.680\n go out.\n\n28:33.680 --> 28:40.400\n So again, astronomers, I like to say, support your local astronomer, they may help someday\n\n28:40.400 --> 28:46.160\n save humanity by telling the power companies to shut down the grid, finding the asteroid\n\n28:46.160 --> 28:52.260\n 50 or 100 years before it hits, then having clever physicists and engineers deflect it.\n\n28:52.260 --> 29:00.960\n So many of these cosmic threats, cosmic existential threats, we can actually predict and do something\n\n29:00.960 --> 29:05.360\n about or observe before they hit and do something about.\n\n29:05.360 --> 29:10.920\n So it's terrifying to think that people would listen to this conversation.\n\n29:10.920 --> 29:14.600\n It's like when you listen to Bill Gates talk about pandemics in his Ted talk a few years\n\n29:14.600 --> 29:19.480\n ago and realizing we should have supported our local astronomer more.\n\n29:19.480 --> 29:24.520\n Well, I don't know whether it's more because as I said, I actually think human induced\n\n29:24.520 --> 29:29.440\n threats or things that occur naturally on earth, either a natural pandemic or perhaps\n\n29:29.440 --> 29:36.120\n a bioengineering type pandemic or something like a super volcano.\n\n29:36.120 --> 29:44.080\n There was one event towed by I think it was 70 plus thousand years ago that caused a gigantic\n\n29:44.080 --> 29:50.640\n decrease in temperatures on earth because it sent up so much soot that it blocked the\n\n29:50.640 --> 29:51.640\n sun.\n\n29:51.640 --> 29:55.420\n It's the nuclear winter type disaster scenario that some people including Carl Sagan talked\n\n29:55.420 --> 29:57.440\n about decades ago.\n\n29:57.440 --> 30:02.280\n What we can see in the history of volcanic eruptions even more recently in the 19th century,\n\n30:02.280 --> 30:08.840\n Tambora and other ones, you look at the record and you see rather large dips in temperature\n\n30:08.840 --> 30:12.120\n associated with massive volcanic eruptions.\n\n30:12.120 --> 30:18.000\n Well these super volcanoes, one of which by the way exists under Yellowstone in the central\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:25.400\n US, it's not just one or two states, it's a gigantic region and there's controversy\n\n30:25.400 --> 30:30.880\n as to whether it's likely to blow anytime in the next 100,000 years or so.\n\n30:30.880 --> 30:37.080\n But that would be perhaps not a mass extinction or perhaps not a complete existential threat\n\n30:37.080 --> 30:43.220\n because you have to get rid of the very last humans for that, but at least getting rid\n\n30:43.220 --> 30:49.460\n of killing off so many humans, truly billions and billions of humans.\n\n30:49.460 --> 30:55.880\n There have been ones tens of thousands of years ago including this one, Toba I think\n\n30:55.880 --> 31:02.880\n it's called, where it's estimated that the human population was down to 10,000 or 5,000\n\n31:02.880 --> 31:05.040\n individuals, something like that.\n\n31:05.040 --> 31:11.320\n If you have a 15 degree drop in temperature over quite a short time, it's not clear that\n\n31:11.320 --> 31:15.960\n even with today's advanced technology, we would be able to adequately respond at least\n\n31:15.960 --> 31:18.260\n for the vast majority of people.\n\n31:18.260 --> 31:21.840\n Maybe some would be in these underground caves where you'd keep the president and a bunch\n\n31:21.840 --> 31:28.080\n of other important people, but the typical person is not going to be protected when all\n\n31:28.080 --> 31:32.120\n of agriculture is cut off.\n\n31:32.120 --> 31:36.960\n It could be hundreds of millions or billions of people starving to death.\n\n31:36.960 --> 31:37.960\n Exactly.\n\n31:37.960 --> 31:38.960\n That's right.\n\n31:38.960 --> 31:44.080\n They don't all die immediately, but they use up their supplies or again, this electrical\n\n31:44.080 --> 31:45.080\n grid.\n\n31:45.080 --> 31:46.080\n First of toilet paper.\n\n31:46.080 --> 31:50.840\n Dash that toilet paper or the electrical grid.\n\n31:50.840 --> 31:55.240\n Imagine North America without power for a year.\n\n31:55.240 --> 31:58.420\n We've become so dependent, we're no longer the cave people.\n\n31:58.420 --> 32:00.160\n They would do just fine.\n\n32:00.160 --> 32:02.480\n What do they care about the electrical grid?\n\n32:02.480 --> 32:06.040\n What do they care about agriculture, their hunters and gatherers?\n\n32:06.040 --> 32:12.240\n But we now have become so used to our way of life that the only real survivors would\n\n32:12.240 --> 32:17.520\n be those rugged individualists who live somewhere out in the forest or in a cave somewhere,\n\n32:17.520 --> 32:20.160\n completely independent of anyone else.\n\n32:20.160 --> 32:21.160\n Yeah.\n\n32:21.160 --> 32:26.080\n Recently I recommended, it's totally new to me, this kind of survivalist folks, but there's\n\n32:26.080 --> 32:27.500\n a few shows.\n\n32:27.500 --> 32:32.720\n There's a lot of shows of those, but I saw one on Netflix and I started watching them\n\n32:32.720 --> 32:37.040\n and they make a lot of sense.\n\n32:37.040 --> 32:43.260\n They reveal to you how dependent we are on all aspects of this beautiful systems we human\n\n32:43.260 --> 32:47.200\n have built and how fragile they are.\n\n32:47.200 --> 32:48.380\n Incredibly fragile.\n\n32:48.380 --> 32:53.040\n And this whole conversation is making me realize how lucky we are.\n\n32:53.040 --> 32:59.240\n Oh, we're incredibly lucky, but we've set ourselves up to be very, very fragile and\n\n32:59.240 --> 33:05.720\n we are intrinsically complex biological creatures that except for the fact that we have brains\n\n33:05.720 --> 33:11.800\n and minds with which we can try to prevent some of these things or respond to them.\n\n33:11.800 --> 33:18.700\n We as a living organism require quite a narrow set of conditions in order to survive.\n\n33:18.700 --> 33:20.240\n We're not cockroaches.\n\n33:20.240 --> 33:23.120\n We're not going to survive a nuclear war.\n\n33:23.120 --> 33:31.360\n So we're kind of this beautiful dance between, we've been talking about astronomy, that astronomy,\n\n33:31.360 --> 33:37.840\n the stars like inspires everybody and at the same time, there's this pragmatic aspect that\n\n33:37.840 --> 33:39.140\n we're talking about.\n\n33:39.140 --> 33:44.880\n And so I see space exploration as the same kind of way that it's reaching out to other\n\n33:44.880 --> 33:48.760\n planets, reaching out to the stars, this really beautiful idea.\n\n33:48.760 --> 33:56.800\n But if you listen to somebody like Elon Musk, he talks about space exploration as very pragmatic.\n\n33:56.800 --> 34:03.880\n Like we have to be, he has this ridiculous way of sounding like an engineer about it,\n\n34:03.880 --> 34:09.440\n which is like, it's obvious we need to become a multi planetary species if we were to survive\n\n34:09.440 --> 34:10.540\n long term.\n\n34:10.540 --> 34:18.080\n So maybe both philosophically in terms of beauty and in terms of practical, what's your\n\n34:18.080 --> 34:24.260\n thoughts on space exploration, on the challenges of it, on how much we should be investing\n\n34:24.260 --> 34:30.760\n in it and on a personal level, like how excited you are by the possibility of going to Mars,\n\n34:30.760 --> 34:34.600\n colonizing Mars and maybe going outside the solar system.\n\n34:34.600 --> 34:35.600\n Yeah.\n\n34:35.600 --> 34:37.920\n You know, great question.\n\n34:37.920 --> 34:41.280\n There's a lot to unpack there of course.\n\n34:41.280 --> 34:44.460\n Humans are by their very nature explorers, pioneers.\n\n34:44.460 --> 34:51.440\n They want to go out, climb the next mountain, see what's behind it, explore the option depths,\n\n34:51.440 --> 34:52.460\n explore space.\n\n34:52.460 --> 34:55.360\n This is our destiny to go out there.\n\n34:55.360 --> 35:02.420\n And of course, from a pragmatic perspective, yes, we need to plant our seeds elsewhere\n\n35:02.420 --> 35:05.480\n really because things could go wrong here on Earth.\n\n35:05.480 --> 35:11.080\n Now some people say that's an excuse to not take care of our planet.\n\n35:11.080 --> 35:14.280\n Well, we say we're elsewhere and so we don't have to take good care of our planet.\n\n35:14.280 --> 35:18.160\n No, we should take the best possible care of our planet.\n\n35:18.160 --> 35:22.120\n We should be cognizant of the potential impact of what we're doing.\n\n35:22.120 --> 35:26.880\n Nevertheless, it's prudent to have us be elsewhere as well.\n\n35:26.880 --> 35:31.200\n So in that regard, I actually agree with Elon.\n\n35:31.200 --> 35:32.420\n It'd be good to be on Mars.\n\n35:32.420 --> 35:38.240\n That would be yet another place for us from which to explore further.\n\n35:38.240 --> 35:39.640\n Would that be a good next step?\n\n35:39.640 --> 35:42.160\n Well, it's a good next step.\n\n35:42.160 --> 35:46.360\n I happen to disagree with him as to how quickly it will happen.\n\n35:46.360 --> 35:48.120\n I think he's very optimistic.\n\n35:48.120 --> 35:52.760\n Now you need visionary people like Elon to get people going and to inspire them.\n\n35:52.760 --> 35:57.120\n I mean, look at the success he's had with multiple companies.\n\n35:57.120 --> 36:03.480\n So maybe he gives this very optimistic timeline in order to be inspirational to those who\n\n36:03.480 --> 36:04.480\n are going out there.\n\n36:04.480 --> 36:10.000\n And certainly his success with the rocket that is reusable because it landed upright\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\n and all that.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:12.400\n I mean, that's a game changer.\n\n36:12.400 --> 36:16.880\n It's sort of like every time you flew from San Francisco to Los Angeles, you discard\n\n36:16.880 --> 36:17.880\n the airplane, right?\n\n36:17.880 --> 36:20.240\n I mean, that's crazy, right?\n\n36:20.240 --> 36:21.840\n So that's a game changer.\n\n36:21.840 --> 36:27.080\n But nevertheless, the timescale over which he thinks that there could be a real thriving\n\n36:27.080 --> 36:30.680\n colony on Mars, I think is far too optimistic.\n\n36:30.680 --> 36:33.480\n What's the biggest challenges to you?\n\n36:33.480 --> 36:40.360\n One is just getting rockets, not rockets, but people out there and two is the colonization.\n\n36:40.360 --> 36:44.360\n Do you have thoughts about this, the challenges of this kind of prospect?\n\n36:44.360 --> 36:50.040\n Yeah, I haven't thought about it in great detail other than recognizing that Mars is\n\n36:50.040 --> 36:51.040\n a harsh environment.\n\n36:51.040 --> 36:52.040\n Yeah.\n\n36:52.040 --> 36:53.360\n You don't have much of an atmosphere there.\n\n36:53.360 --> 36:57.000\n You've got less than a percent of Earth's atmosphere.\n\n36:57.000 --> 37:00.320\n So you'd need to build some sort of a dome right away, right?\n\n37:00.320 --> 37:02.280\n And that would take time.\n\n37:02.280 --> 37:09.280\n You need to melt the water that's in the permafrost or have canals dug from which you transport\n\n37:09.280 --> 37:11.840\n it from the polar ice caps.\n\n37:11.840 --> 37:17.240\n You know, I was reading recently in terms of like, what's the most efficient source\n\n37:17.240 --> 37:20.440\n of nutrition for humans that were to live on Mars?\n\n37:20.440 --> 37:23.480\n And people should look into this, but it turns out to be insects.\n\n37:23.480 --> 37:24.480\n Insects.\n\n37:24.480 --> 37:25.480\n Yeah.\n\n37:25.480 --> 37:29.680\n So you want, you want to build giant colonies of insects and just be eating them.\n\n37:29.680 --> 37:30.680\n Yeah, insects have a lot of protein.\n\n37:30.680 --> 37:32.000\n Yeah, a lot of protein.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.280\n And they're easy to grow.\n\n37:34.280 --> 37:36.200\n Like you can think of them as farming.\n\n37:36.200 --> 37:37.200\n Right.\n\n37:37.200 --> 37:41.960\n But it's not going to be as easy as growing a whole plot of potatoes like in the movie\n\n37:41.960 --> 37:44.240\n The Martian, you know, or something, right?\n\n37:44.240 --> 37:45.880\n It's not going to be that easy.\n\n37:45.880 --> 37:48.420\n But you know, so there's this thin atmosphere.\n\n37:48.420 --> 37:49.620\n It's got the wrong composition.\n\n37:49.620 --> 37:51.820\n It's mostly carbon dioxide.\n\n37:51.820 --> 37:54.900\n There are these violent dust storms.\n\n37:54.900 --> 37:57.800\n The temperatures are generally cold.\n\n37:57.800 --> 37:59.360\n You know, you'd need to do a lot of things.\n\n37:59.360 --> 38:04.840\n You need to terraform it basically in order to make it nicely livable without some dome\n\n38:04.840 --> 38:05.840\n surrounding you.\n\n38:05.840 --> 38:10.880\n And if you, and if you insist on a dome, well, that's not going to house that many people,\n\n38:10.880 --> 38:11.880\n right?\n\n38:11.880 --> 38:17.480\n You know, so let's look, let's look briefly then, you know, we're looking for a new apartment\n\n38:17.480 --> 38:18.480\n to move into.\n\n38:18.480 --> 38:19.480\n Right.\n\n38:19.480 --> 38:20.480\n So let's look outside the solar system.\n\n38:20.480 --> 38:25.440\n Do you think you've, you've spoken about exoplanets as well?\n\n38:25.440 --> 38:31.840\n Do you think there's possible homes out there for us outside of our solar system?\n\n38:31.840 --> 38:33.960\n There are lots and lots of homes.\n\n38:33.960 --> 38:34.960\n Possible homes.\n\n38:34.960 --> 38:40.480\n There are, there's a planetary system around nearly every star you see in the sky.\n\n38:40.480 --> 38:45.920\n And one in five of those is thought to have a roughly Earth like planet.\n\n38:45.920 --> 38:46.920\n And that's a relatively new discovery.\n\n38:46.920 --> 38:47.920\n Yeah.\n\n38:47.920 --> 38:48.920\n It's a new discovery.\n\n38:48.920 --> 38:53.320\n I mean, the Kepler satellite, which was flying around above Earth's atmosphere was able to\n\n38:53.320 --> 38:57.180\n monitor the brightness of stars with exquisite detail.\n\n38:57.180 --> 39:03.880\n And they could detect planets crossing the line of sight between us and the star, thereby\n\n39:03.880 --> 39:08.080\n dimming its light for a short time ever so slightly.\n\n39:08.080 --> 39:09.240\n And it's amazing.\n\n39:09.240 --> 39:14.120\n So there are now thousands and thousands of these exoplanet candidates of which something\n\n39:14.120 --> 39:17.380\n like 90% are probably genuine exoplanets.\n\n39:17.380 --> 39:25.100\n And you have to remember that only about 1% of stars have their planetary system oriented\n\n39:25.100 --> 39:30.960\n edge on to your line of sight, which is what you need for this transit method to work,\n\n39:30.960 --> 39:31.960\n right?\n\n39:31.960 --> 39:36.200\n Your planetary angle won't work and certainly perpendicular to your line of sight.\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:40.920\n That is in the plane of the sky won't work because the planet is orbiting the star and\n\n39:40.920 --> 39:43.680\n never crossing your line of sight.\n\n39:43.680 --> 39:51.240\n So the fact that they found planets orbiting about 1% of the stars that they looked at\n\n39:51.240 --> 39:57.720\n in this field of 150 plus thousand stars, they found planets around 1%.\n\n39:57.720 --> 40:06.820\n You then multiply by the inverse of 1%, which is 1% is about what the fraction of the stars\n\n40:06.820 --> 40:10.720\n that have their planetary system oriented the right way.\n\n40:10.720 --> 40:16.840\n And that already back of the envelope calculation tells you that of order 50 to 100% of all\n\n40:16.840 --> 40:18.280\n stars have planets.\n\n40:18.280 --> 40:21.780\n And then they've been finding these Earth like planets, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n40:21.780 --> 40:23.840\n So there are many potential homes.\n\n40:23.840 --> 40:26.680\n The problem is getting there.\n\n40:26.680 --> 40:32.720\n So then a typical bright star, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, maybe not a typical\n\n40:32.720 --> 40:37.600\n bright star, but it's 8.7 light years away.\n\n40:37.600 --> 40:43.440\n So that means the light took 8.7 years to reach us.\n\n40:43.440 --> 40:47.460\n We're seeing it as it was about nine years ago.\n\n40:47.460 --> 40:54.560\n So then you ask how long would a rocket take to get there at Earth's escape speed, which\n\n40:54.560 --> 40:57.000\n is 11 kilometers per second.\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:01.540\n And it turns out it's about a quarter of a million years.\n\n41:01.540 --> 41:04.120\n Now that's 10,000 generations.\n\n41:04.120 --> 41:07.360\n Let's say a generation of humans is 25 years.\n\n41:07.360 --> 41:14.760\n So you'd need this colony of people that is able to sustain itself, all their food, all\n\n41:14.760 --> 41:18.660\n their waste disposal, all their water, all the recycling of everything.\n\n41:18.660 --> 41:26.800\n For 10,000 generations, they have to commit themselves to living on this vehicle.\n\n41:26.800 --> 41:28.920\n I just don't see it happening.\n\n41:28.920 --> 41:34.520\n What I see potentially happening, if we avoid self destruction, intentional or unintentional\n\n41:34.520 --> 41:40.960\n here on Earth, is that machines will do it, robots that can essentially hibernate.\n\n41:40.960 --> 41:44.640\n They don't need to do much of anything for a long, long time as they're traveling.\n\n41:44.640 --> 41:50.720\n And moreover, if some energetic charged particle, some cosmic ray, hits the circuitry, it fixes\n\n41:50.720 --> 41:51.720\n itself.\n\n41:51.720 --> 41:55.800\n Machines can do this.\n\n41:55.800 --> 41:57.940\n It's a form of artificial intelligence.\n\n41:57.940 --> 42:00.100\n You just tell the thing, fix yourself basically.\n\n42:00.100 --> 42:05.920\n And then when you land on the planet, start producing copies of yourself, initially from\n\n42:05.920 --> 42:10.280\n materials that were perhaps sent, or you just have a bunch of copies there.\n\n42:10.280 --> 42:13.740\n And then they set up factories with which to do this.\n\n42:13.740 --> 42:20.800\n This is very, very futuristic, but it's much more feasible, I think, than sending flesh\n\n42:20.800 --> 42:28.480\n and blood over interstellar distances, a quarter of a million years to even the nearest stars.\n\n42:28.480 --> 42:32.180\n You're subject to all kinds of charged particles and radiation.\n\n42:32.180 --> 42:34.440\n You have to shield yourself really well.\n\n42:34.440 --> 42:38.080\n That's by the way, one of the problems of going to Mars is that it's not a three day\n\n42:38.080 --> 42:40.040\n journey like going to the moon.\n\n42:40.040 --> 42:45.460\n You're out there for the better part of a year or two, and you're exposed to lots of\n\n42:45.460 --> 42:52.560\n radiation, which typically doesn't do well with living tissue, or living tissue doesn't\n\n42:52.560 --> 42:54.800\n do well with the radiation.\n\n42:54.800 --> 43:05.400\n And the hope is that the robots, the AI systems might be able to carry the fire of consciousness,\n\n43:05.400 --> 43:11.120\n whatever makes us humans, like a little drop of whatever makes us humans so special, not\n\n43:11.120 --> 43:12.720\n to be too poetic about it.\n\n43:12.720 --> 43:17.480\n No, but I like being poetic about it because it's an amazing question.\n\n43:17.480 --> 43:22.400\n Is there something beyond just the bits, the ones and zeros to us?\n\n43:22.400 --> 43:24.760\n It's an interesting question.\n\n43:24.760 --> 43:29.520\n I like to think that there isn't anything, and that how beautiful it is that our thoughts,\n\n43:29.520 --> 43:35.880\n our emotions, our feelings, our compassion all come from these ones and zeros, right?\n\n43:35.880 --> 43:38.800\n That to me actually is a beautiful thought.\n\n43:38.800 --> 43:45.520\n And the idea that machines, silicon based life effectively, could be our natural evolutionary\n\n43:45.520 --> 43:51.360\n descendants, not from a DNA perspective, but they are our creations and they then carry\n\n43:51.360 --> 43:52.360\n on.\n\n43:52.360 --> 43:55.880\n That to me is a beautiful thought in some ways, but others find it to be a horrific\n\n43:55.880 --> 43:56.880\n thought.\n\n43:56.880 --> 43:58.480\n So that's exciting to you.\n\n43:58.480 --> 44:05.240\n It is exciting to me as well because to me, from a purely an engineering perspective,\n\n44:05.240 --> 44:11.280\n I believe it's impossible to create, like whatever systems we create that take over\n\n44:11.280 --> 44:17.540\n the world, it's impossible for me to imagine that those systems will not carry some aspect\n\n44:17.540 --> 44:19.840\n of what makes humans beautiful.\n\n44:19.840 --> 44:26.000\n So like a lot of people have these kind of paperclip ideas that we'll build machines\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:31.240\n that are cold inside or philosophers call them zombies.\n\n44:31.240 --> 44:41.660\n That naturally the systems that will out compete us on this earth will be cold and non conscious,\n\n44:41.660 --> 44:48.720\n not capable of all the human emotions and empathy and compassion and love and hate,\n\n44:48.720 --> 44:53.160\n the beautiful mix of what makes us human.\n\n44:53.160 --> 44:56.520\n But to me, intelligence requires all of that.\n\n44:56.520 --> 45:01.680\n So in order to out compete humans, you better be good at the full picture.\n\n45:01.680 --> 45:02.680\n Right.\n\n45:02.680 --> 45:08.280\n So artificial general intelligence, in my view, encompasses a lot of these attributes\n\n45:08.280 --> 45:13.540\n that you just talked about, curiosity, inquisitiveness, you know, right?\n\n45:13.540 --> 45:17.160\n It might look very different than us humans, but it will have some of the magic.\n\n45:17.160 --> 45:24.120\n But it'll also be much more able to survive the onslaught of existential threats that\n\n45:24.120 --> 45:30.040\n either we bring upon ourselves or don't anticipate here on earth, or that occasionally come from\n\n45:30.040 --> 45:34.400\n beyond and there's nothing much we can do about a supernova explosion that just suddenly\n\n45:34.400 --> 45:36.200\n goes off.\n\n45:36.200 --> 45:42.640\n And really, if we want to move to other planets outside our solar system, I think realistically\n\n45:42.640 --> 45:48.200\n that's a much better option than thinking that humans will actually make these gigantic\n\n45:48.200 --> 45:49.200\n journeys.\n\n45:49.200 --> 45:53.280\n And, you know, then I do this calculation for my class, you know, Einstein's special\n\n45:53.280 --> 45:57.360\n theory of relativity says that you can do it in a short amount of time in your own frame\n\n45:57.360 --> 46:00.520\n of reference if you go close to the speed of light.\n\n46:00.520 --> 46:05.680\n But then you bring in E equals MC squared and you figure out how much energy it takes\n\n46:05.680 --> 46:10.880\n to get you accelerated to close enough to the speed of light to make the time scales\n\n46:10.880 --> 46:13.880\n short in your own frame of reference.\n\n46:13.880 --> 46:17.380\n And the amount of energy is just unfathomable, right?\n\n46:17.380 --> 46:22.120\n We can do it at the Large Hadron Collider with protons, you know, we can accelerate\n\n46:22.120 --> 46:27.560\n them to 99.9999% of the speed of light, but that's just a proton.\n\n46:27.560 --> 46:29.800\n We're gazillions of protons, okay?\n\n46:29.800 --> 46:34.040\n And that doesn't even count the rocket that would carry us, the payload.\n\n46:34.040 --> 46:39.900\n And you would need to either store the fuel in the rocket, which then requires even more\n\n46:39.900 --> 46:44.920\n mass for the rocket or collect fuel along the way, which, you know, is difficult.\n\n46:44.920 --> 46:49.880\n And so getting close to the speed of light, I think, is not an option either other than\n\n46:49.880 --> 46:54.840\n for a little tiny thing like, you know, Yuri Milner and others are thinking about this,\n\n46:54.840 --> 47:00.040\n the Starshot project where they'll send a little tiny camera to Alpha Centauri 4.2 light\n\n47:00.040 --> 47:01.040\n years away.\n\n47:01.040 --> 47:06.080\n They'll zip past it, take a picture of the exoplanets that we know, orbit that three\n\n47:06.080 --> 47:09.320\n or more star system and say hello real quick.\n\n47:09.320 --> 47:12.760\n Say hello real quickly and then send the images back to us, okay?\n\n47:12.760 --> 47:15.060\n So that's a tiny little thing, right?\n\n47:15.060 --> 47:19.960\n Maybe you can accelerate that to, they're hoping, 20% of the speed of light with a whole\n\n47:19.960 --> 47:22.680\n bunch of high powered lasers aimed at it.\n\n47:22.680 --> 47:26.480\n It's not clear that other countries will allow us to do that, by the way, but that's a very\n\n47:26.480 --> 47:27.480\n forward looking thought.\n\n47:27.480 --> 47:31.600\n I mean, I very much support the idea, but there's a big difference between sending a\n\n47:31.600 --> 47:38.920\n little tiny camera and sending a payload of people with equipment that could then mine\n\n47:38.920 --> 47:46.400\n the resources on the exoplanet that they reach and then go forth and multiply, right?\n\n47:46.400 --> 47:51.920\n Well, let's talk about the big galactic things and how we might be able to leverage them\n\n47:51.920 --> 47:52.920\n to travel fast.\n\n47:52.920 --> 48:03.200\n I know this is a little bit science fiction, but, you know, ideas of wormholes and ideas\n\n48:03.200 --> 48:10.680\n at the edge of black holes that reveal to us that this fabric of space time could be\n\n48:10.680 --> 48:13.240\n messed with, perhaps.\n\n48:13.240 --> 48:16.680\n Is that at all an interesting thing for you?\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:24.840\n I mean, in looking out at the universe and studying it as you have, is that also a possible,\n\n48:24.840 --> 48:29.720\n like a dream for you that we might be able to find clues how we can actually use it to\n\n48:29.720 --> 48:31.600\n improve our transportation?\n\n48:31.600 --> 48:32.600\n It's an interesting thought.\n\n48:32.600 --> 48:40.400\n I'm certainly excited by the potential physics that suggests this kind of faster than light\n\n48:40.400 --> 48:45.320\n travel effectively or, you know, cutting the distance to make it very, very short through\n\n48:45.320 --> 48:47.280\n a wormhole or something like that.\n\n48:47.280 --> 48:48.280\n Possible?\n\n48:48.280 --> 48:49.280\n No?\n\n48:49.280 --> 48:54.000\n Well, you know, call me not very imaginative, but based on today's knowledge of physics,\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:58.600\n which I realize, you know, people have gone down that rabbit hole and, you know, a century\n\n48:58.600 --> 49:03.440\n ago, Lord Kelvin, one of the greatest physicists of all time, said that all of fundamental\n\n49:03.440 --> 49:07.280\n physics is done, the rest is just engineering, and guess what?\n\n49:07.280 --> 49:12.340\n Then came special relativity, quantum physics, general relativity, how wrong he was.\n\n49:12.340 --> 49:15.120\n So let me not be another Lord Kelvin.\n\n49:15.120 --> 49:20.360\n On the other hand, I think we know a lot more now about what we know and what we don't know\n\n49:20.360 --> 49:23.340\n and what the physical limitations are.\n\n49:23.340 --> 49:30.300\n And to me, most of these schemes, if not all of them, seem very farfetched, if not impossible.\n\n49:30.300 --> 49:36.820\n So travel through wormholes, for example, you know, it appears that for a non rotating\n\n49:36.820 --> 49:42.480\n black hole, that's just a complete no go because the singularity is a point like singularity\n\n49:42.480 --> 49:49.640\n and you have to reach it to traverse the wormhole and you get squished by the singularity, okay?\n\n49:49.640 --> 49:55.000\n Now for a rotating black hole, it turns out there is a way to pass through the event horizon,\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:59.940\n the boundary of the black hole, and avoid the singularity and go out the other side\n\n49:59.940 --> 50:04.220\n or even traverse the donut hole like singularity.\n\n50:04.220 --> 50:06.880\n In the case of a rotating black hole, it's a ring singularity.\n\n50:06.880 --> 50:11.400\n So there's actually two theoretical ways you could get through a rotating black hole or\n\n50:11.400 --> 50:16.320\n a charged black hole, not that we expect charged black holes to exist in nature because they\n\n50:16.320 --> 50:21.040\n would quickly bring in the opposite charge so as to neutralize themselves.\n\n50:21.040 --> 50:23.640\n But rotating black holes, definitely a reality.\n\n50:23.640 --> 50:25.720\n We now have good evidence for them.\n\n50:25.720 --> 50:29.240\n Do they have traversable wormholes?\n\n50:29.240 --> 50:34.760\n Probably not because it's still the case that when you go in, you go in with so much energy\n\n50:34.760 --> 50:42.280\n that it either squeezes the wormhole shut or you encounter a whole bunch of incoming\n\n50:42.280 --> 50:46.080\n and outgoing energy that vaporizes you.\n\n50:46.080 --> 50:50.600\n It's called the mass inflation instability, and it just sort of vaporizes you.\n\n50:50.600 --> 50:55.060\n Nevertheless, you could imagine, well, you're in some vapor form, but if you make it through,\n\n50:55.060 --> 50:58.200\n maybe you could reform or something.\n\n50:58.200 --> 50:59.200\n So it's still information.\n\n50:59.200 --> 51:00.200\n Yeah, it's still information.\n\n51:00.200 --> 51:04.480\n It's scrambled information, but there's a way maybe of bringing it back, right?\n\n51:04.480 --> 51:11.680\n But then the thing that really bothers me is that as soon as you have this possibility\n\n51:11.680 --> 51:16.760\n of traversal of a wormhole, you have to come to grips with a fundamental problem, and that\n\n51:16.760 --> 51:24.400\n is that you could come back to your universe at a time prior to your leaving, and you could\n\n51:24.400 --> 51:27.480\n essentially prevent your grandparents from ever meeting.\n\n51:27.480 --> 51:29.580\n This is called the grandfather paradox, right?\n\n51:29.580 --> 51:33.880\n And if they never met, and if your parents were never born, and if you were never born,\n\n51:33.880 --> 51:44.880\n how would you have made the journey to prevent the history from allowing you to exist, right?\n\n51:44.880 --> 51:48.560\n It's a violation of causality, of cause and effect.\n\n51:48.560 --> 51:54.720\n Now physicists such as myself take causality violation very, very seriously.\n\n51:54.720 --> 51:55.720\n We've never seen it.\n\n51:55.720 --> 51:56.720\n You took a stand.\n\n51:56.720 --> 52:01.600\n Yeah, I mean, it's one of these back to the future type movies, right?\n\n52:01.600 --> 52:06.640\n And you have to work things out in such a way that you don't mess things up, right?\n\n52:06.640 --> 52:10.500\n Some people say that, well, you come back to the universe, but you come back in such\n\n52:10.500 --> 52:14.960\n a way that you cannot affect your journey.\n\n52:14.960 --> 52:19.360\n But then that seems kind of contrived to me.\n\n52:19.360 --> 52:24.640\n Or some say that you end up in a different universe, and this also goes into the many\n\n52:24.640 --> 52:28.880\n different types of the multiverse hypothesis and the many worlds interpretation and all\n\n52:28.880 --> 52:29.880\n that.\n\n52:29.880 --> 52:34.000\n And then it's not the universe from which you left, right?\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:37.000\n And you don't come back to the universe from which you left.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:42.700\n And so you're not really going back in time to the same universe, and you're not even\n\n52:42.700 --> 52:46.720\n going forward in time necessarily then to the same universe, right?\n\n52:46.720 --> 52:50.200\n You're ending up in some other universe.\n\n52:50.200 --> 52:53.680\n So what have you achieved, right?\n\n52:53.680 --> 52:56.600\n You've traveled.\n\n52:56.600 --> 53:00.720\n You ended up in a different place than you started in more ways than one.\n\n53:00.720 --> 53:01.720\n Yeah.\n\n53:01.720 --> 53:07.320\n And then there's this idea, the Alcubierre drive, where you warp space time in front\n\n53:07.320 --> 53:12.480\n of you so as to greatly reduce the distance, and you can expand the space time behind you.\n\n53:12.480 --> 53:16.120\n So you're sort of riding a wave through space time.\n\n53:16.120 --> 53:20.440\n But the problem I see with that, beyond the practical difficulties and the energy requirements,\n\n53:20.440 --> 53:25.740\n and by the way, how do you get out of this bubble through which you're riding this wave\n\n53:25.740 --> 53:26.740\n of space time?\n\n53:26.740 --> 53:29.160\n And Miguel Alcubierre acknowledged all these things.\n\n53:29.160 --> 53:31.880\n He said this is purely theoretical, fanciful, and all that.\n\n53:31.880 --> 53:38.280\n But a fundamental problem I see is that you'd have to get to those places in front of you\n\n53:38.280 --> 53:44.080\n so as to change the shape of space time so as to make the journey quickly.\n\n53:44.080 --> 53:49.320\n But to get there, you got there in the normal way at a speed considerably less than that\n\n53:49.320 --> 53:50.740\n of light.\n\n53:50.740 --> 53:53.640\n So in a sense, you haven't saved any time, right?\n\n53:53.640 --> 54:00.680\n You might as well have just taken that journey and gotten to where you were going, right?\n\n54:00.680 --> 54:01.680\n What have you done?\n\n54:01.680 --> 54:06.480\n It's not like you snap your fingers and say, okay, let that space there be compressed,\n\n54:06.480 --> 54:10.040\n and then I'll make it over to Alpha Centauri in the next month.\n\n54:10.040 --> 54:12.240\n You can't snap your fingers and do that.\n\n54:12.240 --> 54:13.240\n Yeah.\n\n54:13.240 --> 54:18.260\n But yeah, we're sort of assuming that we can fix all the biological stuff that requires\n\n54:18.260 --> 54:24.560\n for humans to persist through that whole process, because ultimately, it might go down to just\n\n54:24.560 --> 54:29.360\n extending the life of the human in some form, whether it's through the robot, through the\n\n54:29.360 --> 54:35.240\n digital form, or actually just figuring out genetically how to live forever, because that\n\n54:35.240 --> 54:41.800\n journey that you mentioned, the long journey, might be different if somehow our understanding\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:47.280\n of genetics, of our understanding of our own biology, all that kind of stuff, that's another\n\n54:47.280 --> 54:48.280\n trajectory that possibly...\n\n54:48.280 --> 54:49.280\n Well, right.\n\n54:49.280 --> 54:54.080\n If you could put us into some sort of suspended animation, hibernation or something, and greatly\n\n54:54.080 --> 54:58.580\n increase the lifetime, and so these 10,000 generations I talked about, what do they care?\n\n54:58.580 --> 55:00.960\n It's just one generation, and they're asleep, okay?\n\n55:00.960 --> 55:02.280\n It's a long nap.\n\n55:02.280 --> 55:04.500\n So then you can do it.\n\n55:04.500 --> 55:05.500\n It's still not easy, right?\n\n55:05.500 --> 55:09.320\n Because you've got some big old huge colony, and that just through E equals MC squared,\n\n55:09.320 --> 55:10.320\n right?\n\n55:10.320 --> 55:11.320\n That's a lot of mass.\n\n55:11.320 --> 55:13.480\n That's a lot of stuff to accelerate.\n\n55:13.480 --> 55:18.200\n The Newtonian kinetic energy is gigantic, right?\n\n55:18.200 --> 55:23.480\n So you're still not home free, but at least you're not trying to do it in a short amount\n\n55:23.480 --> 55:26.240\n of clock time, right?\n\n55:26.240 --> 55:32.520\n Which if you look at E equals MC squared, requires truly unfathomable amounts of energy,\n\n55:32.520 --> 55:39.800\n because the energy is your rest mass, M naught C squared, divided by the square root of one\n\n55:39.800 --> 55:42.200\n minus V squared over C squared.\n\n55:42.200 --> 55:46.440\n And if your listeners want to just sort of stick into their pocket calculator, as V over\n\n55:46.440 --> 55:52.100\n C approaches one, that one over the square root of one minus V squared over C squared\n\n55:52.100 --> 55:54.160\n approaches infinity.\n\n55:54.160 --> 55:58.520\n So if you wanted to do it in zero time, you'd need an infinite amount of energy.\n\n55:58.520 --> 56:04.680\n That's basically why you can't reach, let alone exceed the speed of light, for a particle\n\n56:04.680 --> 56:07.960\n moving through a preexisting space.\n\n56:07.960 --> 56:11.640\n It's that it takes an infinite amount of energy to do so.\n\n56:11.640 --> 56:15.080\n So that's talking about us going somewhere.\n\n56:15.080 --> 56:22.040\n What about, one of the things that inspires a lot of folks, including myself, is the possibility\n\n56:22.040 --> 56:27.920\n that there's other, that this conversation is happening on another planet in different\n\n56:27.920 --> 56:35.360\n forms with intelligent life forms.\n\n56:35.360 --> 56:41.840\n So first we could start, as a cosmologist, what's your intuition about whether there\n\n56:41.840 --> 56:45.400\n is or isn't intelligent life out there?\n\n56:45.400 --> 56:46.400\n Outside of our own?\n\n56:46.400 --> 56:51.280\n Yeah, I would say I'm one of the pessimists in that I don't necessarily think that we're\n\n56:51.280 --> 56:57.880\n the only ones in the observable universe, which goes out, you know, roughly 14 billion\n\n56:57.880 --> 57:02.640\n years in light travel time and more like, you know, 46 billion years when you take into\n\n57:02.640 --> 57:04.280\n account the expansion of space.\n\n57:04.280 --> 57:08.480\n So the diameter of our observable universe is something like, you know, 90, 92 billion\n\n57:08.480 --> 57:09.700\n light years.\n\n57:09.700 --> 57:16.040\n That encompasses, you know, a hundred billion to a trillion galaxies with, you know, a hundred\n\n57:16.040 --> 57:17.280\n billion stars each.\n\n57:17.280 --> 57:22.400\n So now you're talking about something like 10 to the 22nd, 10 to the 23rd power stars\n\n57:22.400 --> 57:27.880\n and roughly an equal number of Earth like planets and so on.\n\n57:27.880 --> 57:32.000\n So there may well be other intelligent life.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:35.120\n But your sense is our galaxy is not teeming with life.\n\n57:35.120 --> 57:41.080\n Yeah, our galaxy, our Milky Way galaxy with several hundred billion stars and potentially\n\n57:41.080 --> 57:44.080\n habitable planets is not teeming with intelligent life.\n\n57:44.080 --> 57:45.080\n Intelligent.\n\n57:45.080 --> 57:51.520\n Yeah, I wouldn't, well, I'll get to the primitive life, the bacteria in a moment, but, you know,\n\n57:51.520 --> 57:56.920\n we may well be the only ones in our Milky Way galaxy, at most a handful, I'd say, but\n\n57:56.920 --> 58:03.200\n I'd probably side with the school of thought that suggests we're the only ones in our own\n\n58:03.200 --> 58:13.520\n galaxy, just because I don't see human intelligence as being a natural evolutionary path for life.\n\n58:13.520 --> 58:16.000\n I mean, there's a number of arguments.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:22.000\n First of all, there's been more than 10 billion species of life on Earth in its history.\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:27.400\n Everything has approached our level of intelligence and mechanical ability and curiosity.\n\n58:27.400 --> 58:31.600\n You know, whales and dolphins appear to be reasonably intelligent, but there's no evidence\n\n58:31.600 --> 58:35.360\n that they can think abstract thoughts that they're curious about the world.\n\n58:35.360 --> 58:39.720\n They certainly can't build machines with which to study the world.\n\n58:39.720 --> 58:41.520\n So that's one argument.\n\n58:41.520 --> 58:47.560\n Secondly, we came about as early hominids only four or five million years ago and as\n\n58:47.560 --> 58:52.100\n homo sapiens only about a quarter of a million years ago.\n\n58:52.100 --> 58:56.920\n So for the vast majority of the history of life on Earth, an intelligent alien zipping\n\n58:56.920 --> 59:02.640\n by Earth would have said there's nothing particularly intelligent or mechanically able on Earth.\n\n59:02.640 --> 59:03.640\n Okay.\n\n59:03.640 --> 59:10.760\n Thirdly, it's not clear that our intelligence is a long term evolutionary advantage.\n\n59:10.760 --> 59:15.680\n Now it's clear that in the last 100 years, 200 years, we've improved the lives of hundreds\n\n59:15.680 --> 59:21.800\n of millions of people, but at the risk of potentially destroying ourselves either intentionally\n\n59:21.800 --> 59:26.200\n or unintentionally or through neglect, as we discussed before.\n\n59:26.200 --> 59:32.120\n That's a really interesting point, which is it's possible that they're a huge amount of\n\n59:32.120 --> 59:38.200\n intelligent civilizations have been born even through our galaxy, but they live very briefly\n\n59:38.200 --> 59:39.200\n and they die.\n\n59:39.200 --> 59:42.200\n Flash bulbs in the night.\n\n59:42.200 --> 59:47.960\n That brings me to the fourth issue and that is the Fermi paradox.\n\n59:47.960 --> 59:52.440\n If they're common, where the hell are they?\n\n59:52.440 --> 59:56.480\n Notwithstanding the various UFO reports in Roswell and all that, they just don't meet\n\n59:56.480 --> 59:57.700\n the bar.\n\n59:57.700 --> 1:00:02.680\n They don't clear the bar of scientific evidence in my opinion.\n\n1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:08.240\n So there's no clear evidence that they've ever visited us on Earth here.\n\n1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:13.440\n And SETI has been now, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has been scanning the skies and\n\n1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:17.320\n true, we've only looked a couple of hundred light years out and that's a tiny fraction\n\n1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:22.560\n of the whole galaxy, a tiny fraction of these hundred billion plus stars.\n\n1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:30.540\n Nevertheless, if the galaxy were teaming with life, especially intelligent life, you'd expect\n\n1:00:30.540 --> 1:00:34.800\n some of it to have been far more advanced than ours.\n\n1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:39.880\n There's nothing special about when the industrial revolution started on Earth.\n\n1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:45.420\n The chemical evolution of our galaxy was such that billions of years ago, nuclear processing\n\n1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:51.280\n and stars had built up clouds of gas after their explosion that were rich enough in heavy\n\n1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:54.680\n elements to have formed Earth like planets, even billions of years ago.\n\n1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:58.960\n So there could be civilizations that are billions of years ahead of ours.\n\n1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:03.680\n And if you look at the exponential growth of technology among Homo sapiens in the last\n\n1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:07.400\n couple of hundred years and you just project that forward, I mean, there's no telling what\n\n1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:13.360\n they could have achieved even in 1000 or 10,000 years, let alone a million or 10 million or\n\n1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:15.300\n a billion years.\n\n1:01:15.300 --> 1:01:21.120\n And if they reach this capability of interstellar travel and colonization, then you can show\n\n1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:25.860\n that within 10 million years or certainly a hundred million years, you can populate\n\n1:01:25.860 --> 1:01:28.960\n the whole galaxy.\n\n1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:33.680\n So then you don't have to have tried to detect them beyond a hundred or a thousand light\n\n1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:34.680\n years.\n\n1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:35.680\n They would already be here.\n\n1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:41.360\n Do you think as a thought experiment, do you think it's possible that they are already\n\n1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:47.720\n here, but we humans are so human centric that we're just not like our conception of what\n\n1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:53.720\n intelligent life looks like is, we don't want to acknowledge it.\n\n1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:54.720\n Like what if trees?\n\n1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:55.720\n Right.\n\n1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:56.720\n Right.\n\n1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:57.720\n Right.\n\n1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:02.640\n Okay, I guess the, in the form of a question, do you think we'll actually detect intelligent\n\n1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:04.480\n life if it came to visit us?\n\n1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:05.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:08.240\n I mean, it's like, you know, you're an ant crawling around on a sidewalk somewhere and\n\n1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:13.160\n do you notice the humans wandering around and the empire state building and you know,\n\n1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:16.760\n rocket ships flying to the moon and all that kind of stuff, right?\n\n1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:21.340\n It's conceivable that we haven't detected it and that we're so primitive compared to\n\n1:02:21.340 --> 1:02:23.240\n them that we're just not able to do so.\n\n1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:27.540\n Like if you look at dark energy, maybe we call it as a field.\n\n1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:33.800\n It's just that my own feeling is that in science now through observations and experiments,\n\n1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:40.000\n we've measured so many things and basically we understand a lot of stuff.\n\n1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000\n Okay.\n\n1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000\n Fabric of reality.\n\n1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.000\n The fabric of reality, we understand quite well.\n\n1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.480\n And there are a few little things like dark matter and dark energy that may be some sign\n\n1:02:47.480 --> 1:02:50.240\n of some super intelligence, but I doubt it.\n\n1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:51.240\n Okay.\n\n1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:54.480\n You know, why would some super intelligence be holding clusters of galaxies together?\n\n1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:58.280\n Why would they be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the universe?\n\n1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:04.440\n So the point is, is that through science and applied science and engineering, we understand\n\n1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:09.920\n so much now that I'm not saying we know everything, but we know a hell of a lot.\n\n1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:10.920\n Okay.\n\n1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:14.820\n And so there's, it's not like there are lots of mysteries flying around there that are\n\n1:03:14.820 --> 1:03:23.560\n completely outside our level of exploration or understanding.\n\n1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:24.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:32.760\n From a, I would say from, from a mystery perspective, it seems like the mystery of our own like\n\n1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:38.760\n cognition and consciousness is much grander than like the degrees of freedom of possible\n\n1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:42.840\n explanations for what the heck is going on is much greater there than in the, in the\n\n1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:44.440\n physics of the observed.\n\n1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:46.000\n How the brain works.\n\n1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.560\n How did life arise?\n\n1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:48.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:50.500\n That's big, big questions.\n\n1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:57.000\n But they, to me, don't indicate the existence of, of, of an alien or something.\n\n1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.760\n I mean, unless we are the aliens, you know, we could have been contamination from some\n\n1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:06.120\n rocket ship that, that hit here a long, long time ago and all evidence of it has been destroyed.\n\n1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:09.740\n But again, that alien would have started out somewhere.\n\n1:04:09.740 --> 1:04:14.260\n They're not, they're not here watching us right now, right?\n\n1:04:14.260 --> 1:04:16.060\n They're not among us.\n\n1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:22.480\n And so though there are expert potential explanations for the Fermi paradox, and one of them that\n\n1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:29.120\n I kind of like is that the truly intelligent creatures are those that decided not to colonize\n\n1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.280\n the whole galaxy because they'd quickly run out of room there because it's exponential,\n\n1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:34.280\n right?\n\n1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:39.480\n You send a probe to a planet, it makes two copies, they go out, they make two copies\n\n1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:41.480\n each and it's an exponential, right?\n\n1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:43.200\n They quickly colonize the whole galaxy.\n\n1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:47.620\n But then the distance to the next galaxy, the next big one like Andromeda, that's two\n\n1:04:47.620 --> 1:04:50.080\n and a half million light years.\n\n1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:52.480\n That's a much grander scale now, right?\n\n1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:59.080\n And so it also could be that the reason they survived this long is that they got over this\n\n1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:06.720\n tendency that may well exist among sufficiently intelligent creatures, this tendency for aggression\n\n1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:09.280\n and self destruction, right?\n\n1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:14.480\n If they bypass that, and that may be one of the great filters if there are more than one,\n\n1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:15.480\n right?\n\n1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:21.800\n Then they may not be a type of creature that feels the need to go and say, oh, there's\n\n1:05:21.800 --> 1:05:28.640\n a nice looking planet and there's a bunch of ants on it, let's go squish them and colonize\n\n1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:29.640\n it.\n\n1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:34.120\n No, it could even be the kind of Star Trek like prime directive where you go and explore\n\n1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:38.340\n worlds, but you don't interfere in any way, right?\n\n1:05:38.340 --> 1:05:44.080\n And also we call it exploration is beautiful and everything, but there is underlying this\n\n1:05:44.080 --> 1:05:47.240\n desire to explore is a desire to conquer.\n\n1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:48.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:52.720\n I mean, if we're just being really honest right now for us, it is right.\n\n1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:58.960\n And you're saying it's possible to separate, but I would venture to say that you wouldn't\n\n1:05:58.960 --> 1:06:00.280\n that those are coupled.\n\n1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:06.160\n So I could, I could imagine a civilization that lives on for billions of years that just\n\n1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:12.440\n stays on, it's like figures out the minimal effort way of just peacefully existing.\n\n1:06:12.440 --> 1:06:13.440\n It's like a monastery.\n\n1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:14.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:15.440\n And it limits itself.\n\n1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:16.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:17.440\n It limits itself.\n\n1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:19.560\n You know, it's, it's planted its seeds in a number of places.\n\n1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:24.280\n So it's not vulnerable to a single point failure, right?\n\n1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:28.760\n Supernova going off near one of these stars or something, or an asteroid or a comet coming\n\n1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:33.320\n in from the Oort cloud equivalent of that planetary system and without warning, you\n\n1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:35.240\n know, thrashing them to bits.\n\n1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:40.480\n So they've got their seeds in a bunch of places, but they chose not to colonize, colonize the\n\n1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:41.480\n galaxy.\n\n1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:47.960\n And they also choose not to interfere with this incredibly prevalent, primitive organism\n\n1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:51.360\n homo sapiens, right?\n\n1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:57.320\n Or they, uh, this is like a, they enjoy, this is like a TV show for them.\n\n1:06:57.320 --> 1:06:58.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:58.320 --> 1:06:59.320\n It could be like a TV show.\n\n1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:00.320\n Right.\n\n1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:01.800\n So they just tuned in.\n\n1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:02.800\n Right.\n\n1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:05.400\n There are no other possible explanations yet.\n\n1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:10.640\n I think that to me, the most likely explanation for the peri me paradox is that they really\n\n1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:12.600\n are very, very rare.\n\n1:07:12.600 --> 1:07:16.080\n And you know, Carl Sagan estimated a hundred thousand of them.\n\n1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:20.120\n If there's that many, some of them would have been way ahead of us and, and I think we would\n\n1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:22.080\n have seen them by now.\n\n1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:24.360\n If there are a handful, maybe they're there.\n\n1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:29.720\n But at that point, you're right on this dividing line between being a pessimist and an optimist.\n\n1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:30.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:31.720\n And what are the odds for that?\n\n1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:32.720\n Right.\n\n1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:35.080\n What are the things that had to go right for us?\n\n1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:36.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:39.600\n And then, you know, getting back to something you said earlier, let's discuss, you know,\n\n1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:40.600\n primitive life.\n\n1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:41.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:44.520\n That could be the thing that's difficult to achieve.\n\n1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:50.200\n Just getting the random molecules together to a point where they start self replicating\n\n1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:53.960\n and evolving and becoming better and all that.\n\n1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:58.120\n That's an inordinately difficult thing, I think, though I'm not, you know, some molecular\n\n1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:01.960\n or cell biologist, but just it's, it's, it's the usual argument.\n\n1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:06.660\n You know, you're wandering around in the Sahara desert and you stumble across a watch.\n\n1:08:06.660 --> 1:08:12.760\n Is your, is your initial response, oh, you know, a bunch of sand grains just came together\n\n1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:14.560\n randomly and formed this watch.\n\n1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:21.200\n No, you, you think that something formed it or it came from some simpler structure that\n\n1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.360\n then became, you know, more complex.\n\n1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:24.360\n All right.\n\n1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:26.000\n It didn't just form.\n\n1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:32.040\n Well, even the simplest life is, is a very, very complex structure.\n\n1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:36.640\n Even the, even the simplest prokaryotic cells, not to mention eukaryotic cells, although\n\n1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:40.580\n that transition may have been the so called great filter as well.\n\n1:08:40.580 --> 1:08:45.180\n Maybe the cells without a nucleus are relatively easy to form.\n\n1:08:45.180 --> 1:08:50.240\n And then the big next step is where you have a nucleus, which then provides a lot of energy,\n\n1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:54.440\n which allows the cell to become much, much more complex and so on.\n\n1:08:54.440 --> 1:09:01.480\n Interestingly, going from eukaryotic cells, single cells to multicellular organisms does\n\n1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:05.640\n not appear to be, at least on earth, one of these great filters because there's evidence\n\n1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:08.980\n that it happened dozens of times independently on earth.\n\n1:09:08.980 --> 1:09:14.640\n So by, by a really great filter, something that happens very, very rarely, I mean that\n\n1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:25.320\n we had to get through an obstacle that is just incredibly rare to get through.\n\n1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:32.120\n And one of the really exciting scientific things is that that particular point is something\n\n1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:37.020\n that we might be able to discover, even in our lifetimes that find life elsewhere like\n\n1:09:37.020 --> 1:09:42.840\n Europa or be able to see that would be bad news, right?\n\n1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:49.640\n Because if we find lots of pretty advanced life, yeah, that would suggest, and especially\n\n1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:53.520\n if we found some, you know, defunct, you know, fossilized civilization or something somewhere\n\n1:09:53.520 --> 1:10:00.660\n else that would be bacteria, you mean, defunct civilization of like, oh, I'm sorry, I switched\n\n1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:01.660\n gears there.\n\n1:10:01.660 --> 1:10:06.840\n If we, if we found some intelligent or even trilobites right and stuff, you know, elsewhere,\n\n1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:09.840\n that would be bad news for us because that would mean that the great filter is ahead\n\n1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:16.400\n of us, you know, right, because it would mean that lots of, lots of things have gotten roughly\n\n1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:17.400\n to our level.\n\n1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:18.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:23.400\n But, but given the Fermi paradox, if you accept that the Fermi paradox means that there's\n\n1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:27.800\n no one else out there, you don't necessarily have to accept that, but if you accept that\n\n1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:31.980\n it means that no one else is out there and yet there are lots of things we found that\n\n1:10:31.980 --> 1:10:36.940\n are at or roughly at our level, that means that the great filter is ahead of us and that\n\n1:10:36.940 --> 1:10:45.700\n bodes poorly for our longterm future, you know, it's funny you said, uh, you started by saying\n\n1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:51.040\n you're a little bit on the pessimistic side, but it's funny because we're doing this kind\n\n1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:56.600\n of dance between pessimism and optimism because I'm not sure if us being alone in the observable\n\n1:10:56.600 --> 1:11:03.080\n universe as intelligent beings is pessimistic, well, it's good news in a sense for us because\n\n1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:10.880\n it means that we made it through, see, if we're the only ones and there are such great\n\n1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:16.400\n filters, maybe more than one formation of life might be one of them formation of eukaryotic\n\n1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:22.000\n that is with the nucleus cells being another development of human like intelligence might\n\n1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:23.040\n be another, right?\n\n1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:27.720\n There might be several such filters and we were the lucky ones.\n\n1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:31.640\n And you know, then people say, well then that means you're putting yourself into a special\n\n1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:35.520\n perspective and every time we've done that we've been wrong and yeah, yeah, I know all\n\n1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:41.400\n those arguments, but it still could be the case that there's one of us at least per galaxy\n\n1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:47.260\n or pretend or a hundred or a thousand galaxies and we're sitting here having this conversation\n\n1:11:47.260 --> 1:11:49.000\n because we exist.\n\n1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:53.180\n And so there's a, there's an observational selection effect there, right?\n\n1:11:53.180 --> 1:11:57.000\n Just because we're special doesn't mean that we shouldn't have these conversations about\n\n1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.920\n whether or not we're special, right?\n\n1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:02.120\n Yeah, so that's, that's so exciting.\n\n1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:03.360\n That's optimistic.\n\n1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:08.400\n So that's the, that's the optimistic part that if we don't find other intelligent life\n\n1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:13.120\n there, it might mean that we're the ones that made it.\n\n1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:19.160\n And in general, outside the great filter and so on, you know, it's not obvious that the\n\n1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:23.760\n Stephen Hawking thing, which is, it's not obvious that life out there is going to be kind to\n\n1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:24.760\n us.\n\n1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:25.760\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:33.040\n So, you know, I knew Hawking and I greatly respect his, his scientific work and in particular\n\n1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:38.320\n the early work on the unification of general theory of relativity and quantum physics to\n\n1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:42.760\n two great pillars in modern physics, you know, Hawking radiation and all that fantastic work.\n\n1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:47.240\n You know, if you were alive, you should have been a recipient of this year's physics Nobel\n\n1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:53.260\n prize, which was for the discovery of black holes and also by Roger Penrose for the theoretical\n\n1:12:53.260 --> 1:13:00.120\n work showing that given a star that's massive enough, you basically can't avoid having a\n\n1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:01.120\n black hole.\n\n1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:02.120\n Anyway, Hawking, fantastic.\n\n1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:04.420\n I, I tip my hat to him.\n\n1:13:04.420 --> 1:13:05.420\n May he rest in peace.\n\n1:13:05.420 --> 1:13:10.400\n That would have been a heck of a Nobel prize, black holes, heck of a good group.\n\n1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:14.820\n But, but, but going back to what he said that we shouldn't be broadcasting our presence\n\n1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:21.160\n to others there, I actually disagree with him respectfully because first of all, we've\n\n1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:25.360\n been unintentionally broadcasting our presence for a hundred years since the development\n\n1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:27.200\n of radio and TV.\n\n1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:28.200\n Okay.\n\n1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:35.600\n Secondly, any alien that has the capability of coming here and squashing us either already\n\n1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.880\n knows about us and you know, doesn't care because we're just like little ants.\n\n1:13:39.880 --> 1:13:42.920\n And when there are ants in your kitchen, you tend to squash them.\n\n1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:47.400\n But if there are ants on the sidewalk and you're walking by, do you feel some great\n\n1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:49.720\n conviction that you have to squash any of them?\n\n1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:51.440\n No, you generally don't, right?\n\n1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:53.040\n We're irrelevant to them.\n\n1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:57.800\n All they need to do is keep an eye on us to see whether we're approaching the kind of\n\n1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:04.800\n technological capability and know about them and have intentions of attacking them.\n\n1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:06.960\n And then they can squash us, right?\n\n1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:10.800\n Um, you know, they, they could have done it long ago.\n\n1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:11.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:17.160\n They'll, they'll do it if they want to, whether we advertise our presence or not is, is irrelevant.\n\n1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:21.720\n So I really think that that's not a huge existential threat.\n\n1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:25.020\n So this is a good place to bring up a difficult topic.\n\n1:14:25.020 --> 1:14:31.160\n You mentioned, um, they might, they would be paying attention to us to see if we come\n\n1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:34.120\n up with any crazy technology.\n\n1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:37.840\n There's folks who have reported UFO sightings.\n\n1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:42.520\n There's actually, I've recently found out there's a websites that track this, the data,\n\n1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:48.680\n the data of these reportings, and there's millions of them in the past, uh, several\n\n1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:49.680\n decades.\n\n1:14:49.680 --> 1:14:58.760\n So seven decades and so on that they've been recorded and the ufologist community, as they\n\n1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:05.040\n refer to themselves, you know, one of the ideas that I find compelling from an alien\n\n1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:11.560\n perspective that they kind of started showing up ever since we figured out how to build\n\n1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:19.760\n nuclear weapons that we should, uh, so I mean, you know, if I was an LA and I would start\n\n1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:23.240\n showing up then as well, just, well, why not just observe us from afar?\n\n1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:24.240\n No, I know.\n\n1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:25.240\n Right.\n\n1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:30.160\n I would figure out, but that's why I'm always, uh, keeping a distance and staying blurry,\n\n1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:37.320\n but very pixelated, very pixelated, you know, that there is a something in the human condition\n\n1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:43.320\n that a cognition that wants to see, wants to believe beautiful things and, uh, some\n\n1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:51.040\n are terrifying, some are exciting, uh, goats, Bigfoot is a big fascination for folks.\n\n1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:52.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:54.000\n And, uh, UFO sightings, I think falls into that.\n\n1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:02.320\n There's people that look at lights in the night sky and I mean, there's, it's kind of\n\n1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:07.840\n a downer to think in a skeptical sense, to think that that's just a light.\n\n1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:08.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:11.280\n You want to feel like there's something magical there.\n\n1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:12.280\n Sure.\n\n1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:16.600\n Uh, I mean, I felt that first when my dad, my dad's a physicist, when he first told me\n\n1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:22.080\n about ball lightning when I was like a little kid, very weird, very like weird physical\n\n1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:23.080\n phenomenon.\n\n1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:29.880\n And he said, his intuition was telling me this as a little kid, uh, like, I really like\n\n1:16:29.880 --> 1:16:30.880\n math.\n\n1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:34.680\n His intuition was whoever figures out ball lightning, we'll get a Nobel prize.\n\n1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:40.040\n Like he, I think that was a side comment he gave me and I decided there when I was like\n\n1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:44.840\n five years old or whatever, I'm going to win a Nobel prize for figuring out ball lightning.\n\n1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:49.040\n That was like one of the first sort of sparks of the scientific mindset.\n\n1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:51.560\n Those mysteries, they capture your imagination.\n\n1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:56.880\n I think when I speak to people that report UFOs, that's that fire.\n\n1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:57.880\n That's what I see.\n\n1:16:57.880 --> 1:16:58.880\n That excitement.\n\n1:16:58.880 --> 1:16:59.880\n And I understand that.\n\n1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:02.960\n But what, what do we do with that?\n\n1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:08.120\n Because there's hundreds of thousands, if not millions, and then the scientific community,\n\n1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:09.120\n you're like the perfect person.\n\n1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:13.120\n You have an awesome Einstein shirt.\n\n1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:17.120\n What, what do we do with those reports?\n\n1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:21.840\n It's a, most of the scientific community kind of rolls their eyes and dismisses it.\n\n1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:30.520\n Is it possible that a tiny percent of those folks saw something that's worth deeply investigating?\n\n1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:31.520\n Sure.\n\n1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:32.600\n We should investigate it.\n\n1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:37.000\n It's just one of these things where, you know, they've not brought us a hunk of kryptonite\n\n1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.340\n or something like that, right?\n\n1:17:38.340 --> 1:17:44.320\n They haven't brought us actual tangible physical evidence with which experiments can be done\n\n1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:45.320\n in laboratories.\n\n1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:46.320\n Right.\n\n1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:48.120\n It's, it's anecdotal evidence.\n\n1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:54.360\n The photographs are, in some cases, in most cases, I would say quite ambiguous.\n\n1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:55.560\n I don't know what to think about.\n\n1:17:55.560 --> 1:17:58.000\n So David Faber is the first person.\n\n1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.960\n He's a Navy pilot, commander, and there's a bunch of them, but he's sort of one of the\n\n1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:08.900\n most legit pilots and people I've ever met.\n\n1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:14.160\n The fact that he saw something weird, he doesn't know what the heck it is, but he saw something\n\n1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:15.160\n weird.\n\n1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:16.920\n I mean, I don't know what to do with that.\n\n1:18:16.920 --> 1:18:24.040\n And one on the psychological side, so I'm pretty confident he saw what he says he saw,\n\n1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:29.240\n which he's not, he's saying it's something weird.\n\n1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:36.560\n One of the interesting psychological things that worries me is that everybody in the Navy,\n\n1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:40.960\n everybody in the US government, everybody in the scientific community, just kind of\n\n1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:45.800\n like pretended that nothing happened.\n\n1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:47.200\n That kind of instinct.\n\n1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:53.260\n That's what makes me believe if aliens show up, we would all like just ignore their presence.\n\n1:18:53.260 --> 1:19:00.000\n That's what bothered me that you don't, you don't investigate it more carefully and use\n\n1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.520\n this opportunity to inspire the world.\n\n1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:12.120\n So in terms of kryptonite, I think the conspiracy theory folks say that whenever there is some\n\n1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:17.480\n good hard evidence that scientists would be excited about, there's this kind of conspiracy\n\n1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:21.360\n that I don't like because it's ultimately negative that the US government will somehow\n\n1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:26.080\n hide the good evidence to protect it.\n\n1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:32.200\n Of course, there's some legitimacy to it because you want to protect military secrets, all\n\n1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.200\n that kind of stuff.\n\n1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:41.680\n But I don't know what to do with this beautiful mess because I think millions of people are\n\n1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:47.760\n inspired by UFOs and it feels like an opportunity to inspire people about science.\n\n1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:53.200\n So I would say, as Carl Sagan used to say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary\n\n1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:54.200\n evidence.\n\n1:19:54.200 --> 1:19:59.240\n I've quoted him a number of times.\n\n1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:03.000\n We would welcome such evidence.\n\n1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:08.960\n On the other hand, a lot of the things that are seen or perhaps even hidden from us, you\n\n1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:15.560\n could imagine for military purposes, surveillance purposes, the US government doesn't want us\n\n1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:16.560\n to know.\n\n1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:24.120\n Or maybe some of these pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or whatever satellites or some of\n\n1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:31.040\n the crashes that have occurred were later found to be weather balloons or whatever.\n\n1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:40.720\n When there are more conventional explanations, science tends to stay away from the sensational\n\n1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:41.960\n ones.\n\n1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:49.000\n And so it may be that someone else's calling in life is to investigate these phenomena.\n\n1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.640\n And I welcome that as a scientist.\n\n1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:58.360\n I don't categorically actually deny the possibility that ships of some sort could have visited\n\n1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:04.240\n us because, as I said earlier, at slow speeds, there's no problem in reaching other stars.\n\n1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:08.920\n In fact, our Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft in a few million years are going to be in\n\n1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:10.920\n the vicinity of different stars.\n\n1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:15.200\n We can even calculate which ones they're going to be in the vicinity of, right?\n\n1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:19.280\n So there's nothing that breaks any laws of physics if you do it slowly.\n\n1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:24.480\n But that's different, just having Voyager or Pioneer fly by some star, that's different\n\n1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:31.680\n from having active aliens altering the trajectory of their vehicle in real time, spying on us,\n\n1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:38.200\n and then either zipping back to their home planet or sending signals that tell them about\n\n1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:44.760\n us because they are likely many light years away, and they're not going to have broken\n\n1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:48.800\n that barrier as well, okay?\n\n1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:54.080\n So I just, you know, go ahead, study them.\n\n1:21:54.080 --> 1:22:00.400\n For some young kid who wants to do it, it might be their calling, and that's how they\n\n1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:05.960\n might find meaning in their lives, is to be the scientist who really explores these things.\n\n1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:11.520\n I chose not to because at a very young age, I found the evidence, to the degree that I\n\n1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:18.320\n investigated it, to be really quite unconvincing, and I had other things that I wanted to do.\n\n1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:23.040\n But I don't categorically deny the possibility, and I think it should be investigated.\n\n1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:31.840\n Yeah, I mean, this is one of those phenomena that 99.9% of people are almost definitely,\n\n1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:38.300\n there's conventional explanations, and then there's like mysterious things that probably\n\n1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:45.400\n have explanations that are a little bit more complicated, but there's not enough to work\n\n1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:46.400\n with.\n\n1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:52.440\n I tend to believe that if aliens showed up, there will be plenty of evidence for scientists\n\n1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:53.440\n to study.\n\n1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:54.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:54.440 --> 1:23:03.760\n And exactly as you said, avoid your type of spacecraft that could see sort of some kind\n\n1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:09.240\n of, kind of a dumb thing, almost like a sensor that's like probing, like statistically speaking.\n\n1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:10.240\n Flying by.\n\n1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:13.920\n Flying by, maybe lands, maybe there's some kind of robot type of thingies that just like\n\n1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:17.920\n move around and so on, like in ways that we don't understand.\n\n1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:27.320\n But I feel like, well, I feel like there'll be plenty of hard, hard to dismiss evidence.\n\n1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:33.900\n And I also, especially this year, believe that the US government is not sufficiently\n\n1:23:33.900 --> 1:23:39.460\n competent given the huge amount of evidence that will be revealed from this kind of thing\n\n1:23:39.460 --> 1:23:41.400\n to conceal all of it.\n\n1:23:41.400 --> 1:23:42.400\n Right.\n\n1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:46.720\n At least in modern times, you can say maybe decades ago, but in modern times.\n\n1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:51.200\n Right, you know, the people I speak to and the reason I bring it up is because so many\n\n1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:53.600\n people write to me, they're inspired by it.\n\n1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:57.160\n By the way, I wanted to comment on something you said earlier on, yeah, I had said that\n\n1:23:57.160 --> 1:24:03.640\n I'm sort of a pessimist in that I think there are very few other intelligent, mechanically\n\n1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:06.160\n able creatures out there.\n\n1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:10.360\n But then I said, yes, in a sense, I'm an optimist, as you pointed out, because it means\n\n1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:13.240\n that we made it through the great filter.\n\n1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:14.240\n Right.\n\n1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:19.440\n I meant originally that I'm a pessimist in that I'm pessimistic about the possibility\n\n1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:23.920\n that there are many, many of us out there, you know, mathematically speaking in the Drake\n\n1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:24.920\n equation.\n\n1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:25.920\n Exactly.\n\n1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:26.920\n Right.\n\n1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:27.920\n Right.\n\n1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:28.920\n But it may mean a good thing for our ultimate survival.\n\n1:24:28.920 --> 1:24:29.920\n Right.\n\n1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:30.920\n So I'm glad you caught me on that.\n\n1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:32.440\n Yeah, I definitely agree with you.\n\n1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:34.000\n It is ultimately an optimistic statement.\n\n1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.140\n But anyway, I think, you know, UFO research is interesting.\n\n1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:43.280\n And I guess one of the reasons I've not been terribly convinced is that I think there are\n\n1:24:43.280 --> 1:24:49.080\n some scientists who are investigating this and they've not found any clear evidence.\n\n1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:53.880\n Now, I must admit, I have not looked through the literature to convince myself that there\n\n1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:58.000\n are many scientists doing systematic studies of these various reports.\n\n1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:03.620\n I can't say for sure that there's a critical mass of them, but it's just that you never\n\n1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:06.580\n get these reports from hardcore scientists.\n\n1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:07.580\n That's another thing.\n\n1:25:07.580 --> 1:25:08.680\n And astronomers, you know, what do we do?\n\n1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:12.760\n We spend our time studying the heavens and you'd think we'd be the ones that are most\n\n1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:17.480\n likely aside from pilots, perhaps, at seeing weird things in the sky.\n\n1:25:17.480 --> 1:25:22.240\n And we just never do of the unexplained UFO type nature.\n\n1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:28.720\n Yeah, I definitely, I try to keep an open mind, but for people who listen, it's actually\n\n1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:30.680\n really difficult for scientists.\n\n1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:38.160\n Like I get probably like this year, I've probably gotten over probably maybe over a thousand\n\n1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:42.740\n emails on the topic of AGI.\n\n1:25:42.740 --> 1:25:48.760\n It's very difficult to, you know, people write to me, it's like, how can you ignore this\n\n1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:49.880\n in AGI side?\n\n1:25:49.880 --> 1:25:53.880\n Like this model, this is obviously the model that's going to achieve general intelligence.\n\n1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:54.880\n How can you ignore it?\n\n1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:55.880\n I'm giving you the answer.\n\n1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:56.880\n Here's my document.\n\n1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:00.600\n And they're always just these large write ups.\n\n1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:07.920\n The problem is it's very difficult to weed through a bunch of BS.\n\n1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:15.040\n It's very possible that you had actually saw the UFO, but you have to acknowledge that\n\n1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:20.460\n by UFO, I mean, an extraterrestrial life, you have to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands\n\n1:26:20.460 --> 1:26:26.600\n of people who are a little bit, if not a lot full of BS.\n\n1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:33.560\n And from a scientist perspective, it's really hard work and it's when there's amazing stuff\n\n1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:40.240\n out there, it's like, why invest in Bigfoot when evolution in all of its richness is beautiful?\n\n1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:43.360\n Who cares about a monkey that walks on two feet or eight or whatever?\n\n1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:47.940\n Like there's a zillion decoys at observatories.\n\n1:26:47.940 --> 1:26:48.940\n True fact.\n\n1:26:48.940 --> 1:26:55.280\n We get lots and lots of phone calls when Venus, the evening star, but just really a bright\n\n1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:00.360\n planet happens to be close to the crescent moon because it's such a striking pair.\n\n1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:01.360\n This happens once in a while.\n\n1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:04.720\n And we get these phone calls, oh, there's a UFO next to the moon.\n\n1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:06.280\n And no, it's Venus.\n\n1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:12.520\n And so they're just and I'm not saying the best UFO reports are of that nature.\n\n1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:14.400\n No, there are some much more convincing cases.\n\n1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:17.240\n And I've seen some of the footage and blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:19.520\n But it's just there's so many decoys, right?\n\n1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:22.660\n So much so much noise that you have to filter out.\n\n1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:23.920\n And there's only so many scientists.\n\n1:27:23.920 --> 1:27:24.920\n So it's hard.\n\n1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:25.920\n There's only so much.\n\n1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:27.240\n There's only so much time as well.\n\n1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:30.000\n And you have to choose what problems you work on.\n\n1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:37.720\n You know, this might be a fun question to ask to kind of explore the idea of the expanding\n\n1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:38.720\n universe.\n\n1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:39.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:46.800\n So the the radius of the observable universe is 45.7 billion light years.\n\n1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:47.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:56.240\n And the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.\n\n1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:00.880\n That's less than the radius of the universe.\n\n1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:01.880\n How's that possible?\n\n1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:03.560\n So that's a great question.\n\n1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:08.720\n So I meant to bring a little a little prop I have with ping pong balls on a rubber hose,\n\n1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:09.720\n a rubber band.\n\n1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:14.080\n I use it in many of the lectures that one can find of me online.\n\n1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:20.120\n But you have in an expanding universe, the space itself between galaxies or more correctly,\n\n1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:23.040\n clusters of galaxies expanding.\n\n1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:27.080\n So imagine light going from one cluster to another.\n\n1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:33.640\n It traverses some distance and then while it's traversing the rest, that part that it\n\n1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:38.440\n already traveled through continues to expand.\n\n1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:47.160\n Now 13.7 billion years might have gone by since the light that we are seeing from the\n\n1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:52.280\n early stages, the so called cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the afterglow\n\n1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:54.760\n of the Big Bang or the echo of the Big Bang.\n\n1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:57.400\n Yeah, 13.7 billion years have gone by.\n\n1:28:57.400 --> 1:29:00.840\n That's how long it's taken that light to reach us.\n\n1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:06.080\n But while it's been traveling that distance, the parts that it already traveled continue\n\n1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:08.000\n to expand.\n\n1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:13.280\n So it's like you're walking on at an airport, you know, on one of these walkways and you're\n\n1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:16.200\n walking along because you're trying to get to your terminal.\n\n1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:19.240\n But the walkway is continuing as well.\n\n1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:24.160\n You end up traveling a greater distance or the same distance faster is another way of\n\n1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:25.280\n putting it, right?\n\n1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:28.360\n That's why you get on one of these traveling walkways.\n\n1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:33.560\n So you get roughly a factor of pi, you know, but it's more like 3.2, I think.\n\n1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:38.640\n But when you work it all out, you multiply the number of years the universe has been\n\n1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:42.520\n in existence by, you know, three and a quarter or so.\n\n1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:48.920\n And that's how you get this 46 billion light year radius.\n\n1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:56.000\n But how is that, let me ask some nice dumb questions, how is that not traveling faster\n\n1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:57.000\n than the speed of light?\n\n1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:01.160\n Yeah, it's not traveling faster than the speed of light because locally at any point, if\n\n1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:06.640\n you were to measure the light, the photons zipping past, it would not be exceeding the\n\n1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.000\n speed of light.\n\n1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:11.320\n The speed of light is a locally measured quantity.\n\n1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:16.280\n After light has traversed some distance, if the rubber band keeps on stretching, then\n\n1:30:16.280 --> 1:30:23.680\n yes, it looks like the light traveled a greater distance than it would have had the space\n\n1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:25.240\n not been expanding.\n\n1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:28.180\n But locally, it never was exceeding the speed of light.\n\n1:30:28.180 --> 1:30:32.600\n It's just that the distance through which it already traveled then went off and expanded\n\n1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:35.360\n on its own some more.\n\n1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:40.960\n And if you give the light credit, so to speak, for having traversed that distance, well,\n\n1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:43.680\n then it looks like it's going faster than the speed of light.\n\n1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:47.480\n But that's not how speed works.\n\n1:30:47.480 --> 1:30:54.720\n And in relativity, also, the other thing that is interesting is that if you take two ping\n\n1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:59.280\n pong balls that are sufficiently far apart, especially in an accelerating universe, you\n\n1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:03.400\n can easily have them moving apart from one another faster than the speed of light.\n\n1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:09.680\n So take two ping pong balls that were originally 400,000 kilometers from each other and let\n\n1:31:09.680 --> 1:31:14.280\n every centimeter in your rubber band expand to two in one second.\n\n1:31:14.280 --> 1:31:20.720\n Then suddenly, this 400,000 kilometer distance is 800,000 kilometers.\n\n1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:24.480\n It went out by 400,000 kilometers in one second.\n\n1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:29.620\n That exceeds the 300,000 kilometer per second speed of light.\n\n1:31:29.620 --> 1:31:36.240\n But that light limit, that particle limit in special relativity, applies to objects\n\n1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:39.640\n moving through a preexisting space.\n\n1:31:39.640 --> 1:31:46.160\n There's nothing in either special or general relativity that prevents space itself from\n\n1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:48.680\n expanding faster than the speed of light.\n\n1:31:48.680 --> 1:31:49.680\n That's no problem.\n\n1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:55.760\n Einstein wouldn't have had a problem with a universe as observed now by cosmologists.\n\n1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:04.240\n Yeah, I'm not sure I'm yet ready to deal emotionally with expanding space.\n\n1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:09.560\n That to me is one of the most awe inspiring things, starting from the Big Bang.\n\n1:32:09.560 --> 1:32:11.480\n It's definitely abstract.\n\n1:32:11.480 --> 1:32:13.320\n Space itself is expanding.\n\n1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:14.320\n Right.\n\n1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:18.600\n Could you, can we talk about the Big Bang a little bit?\n\n1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:19.600\n Sure.\n\n1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:20.600\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:27.360\n What, so like the entirety of it, the universe, was very small.\n\n1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:28.360\n Right.\n\n1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:29.360\n But it was not a point.\n\n1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:31.160\n It was not a point.\n\n1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:36.080\n Because if we live in what's called a closed universe now, a sphere or the three dimensional\n\n1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:43.120\n version of that would be a hypersphere, then regardless of how far back in time you go,\n\n1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:45.880\n it was always that topological shape.\n\n1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:49.320\n You can't turn a point suddenly into a shell, okay?\n\n1:32:49.320 --> 1:32:52.020\n It always had to be a shell.\n\n1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:57.040\n So when people say, well, the universe started out as a point, that's being kind of flippant,\n\n1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:58.160\n kind of glib.\n\n1:32:58.160 --> 1:32:59.160\n It didn't really.\n\n1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:02.480\n It just started out at a very high density.\n\n1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:06.880\n And we don't know actually whether it was finite or infinite, I think personally that\n\n1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:10.400\n it was finite at the time, but it expanded very, very quickly.\n\n1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:16.300\n Indeed, if it exponentiated and continued in some places to exponentiate, then it could\n\n1:33:16.300 --> 1:33:18.140\n in fact be infinite right now.\n\n1:33:18.140 --> 1:33:20.480\n And most cosmologists think that it is infinite.\n\n1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:21.480\n Wait, wait, wait.\n\n1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:22.480\n Yeah, sorry.\n\n1:33:22.480 --> 1:33:25.040\n What infinite, which dimension, mass, size?\n\n1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:26.440\n Infinite in space.\n\n1:33:26.440 --> 1:33:27.440\n Infinite in space.\n\n1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:29.560\n And by that I mean that if you were trying to measure.\n\n1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:30.560\n There's no boundary.\n\n1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:33.280\n There's no light to measure its size.\n\n1:33:33.280 --> 1:33:37.400\n You'd never be able to measure its size because it would always be bigger than the distance\n\n1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:39.260\n light can travel.\n\n1:33:39.260 --> 1:33:42.760\n That's what you get in a universe that's accelerating in its expansion.\n\n1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:43.760\n Okay.\n\n1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:50.280\n But if a thing was a hypersphere, it's very small, not a point, how can that thing be\n\n1:33:50.280 --> 1:33:51.280\n infinite?\n\n1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:54.040\n Well, it expands exponentially.\n\n1:33:54.040 --> 1:33:56.200\n That's what the inflation theory is all about.\n\n1:33:56.200 --> 1:34:01.400\n Indeed, at your home institution, Alan Guth is one of the originators of the whole inflationary\n\n1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:07.280\n universe idea, along with Andre Linde at Stanford University here in the Bay Area.\n\n1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:11.240\n And others, Alexei Starobinsky and others had similar sorts of ideas.\n\n1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:17.400\n But in an exponentially expanding universe, if you actually try to make this measurement,\n\n1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:22.720\n you send light out to try to see it curve back around and hit you in the back of the\n\n1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:23.720\n head.\n\n1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:29.360\n But in an exponentially expanding universe, the amount of space remaining to be traversed\n\n1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.400\n is always a bigger and bigger quantity.\n\n1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:34.520\n So you'll never get there from here.\n\n1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:35.920\n You'll never reach the back of your head.\n\n1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:41.160\n So observationally or operationally, it can be thought of as being infinite.\n\n1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:43.680\n That's one of the best definitions of infinity, by the way.\n\n1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:44.680\n What's that?\n\n1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:49.520\n That's one of the best sort of physical manifestations of infinity.\n\n1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:50.640\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:53.200\n Because you have to ask, how would you actually measure it?\n\n1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:58.920\n Now, I sometimes say to my cosmology theoretical friends, well, if I were God and I were outside\n\n1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:05.140\n this whole thing and I took a godlike slice in time, wouldn't it be finite no matter how\n\n1:35:05.140 --> 1:35:06.140\n big it is?\n\n1:35:06.140 --> 1:35:13.000\n And they object and they say, Alex, you can't be outside and take a godlike slice of time,\n\n1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000\n you know?\n\n1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.000\n Because there's nothing outside.\n\n1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:22.000\n Well, I'm not, you know, or also, you know, what slice of time you're taking depends on\n\n1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:23.000\n your motion.\n\n1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.680\n And that's true even in special relativity that slices of time get tilted, in a sense,\n\n1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:36.100\n if you're moving quickly, the axes, x and t actually become tilted, not perpendicular\n\n1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:37.920\n to one another.\n\n1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:43.320\n And you can look at Brian Greene's books and lectures and other things where he imagines\n\n1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:50.120\n taking a loaf of bread and slicing it in units of time as you progress forward.\n\n1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:55.160\n But then if you're zipping along relative to that loaf of bread, the slices of time\n\n1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:57.400\n actually become tilted.\n\n1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:00.700\n And so it's not even clear what slices of time mean.\n\n1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:05.040\n But I'm an observational astronomer, I know which end of the telescope to look through.\n\n1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:09.480\n And the way I understand the infinity is, as I just told you, that operationally or\n\n1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:16.340\n observationally, there'd be no way of seeing that it's a finite universe, of measuring\n\n1:36:16.340 --> 1:36:17.340\n a finite universe.\n\n1:36:17.340 --> 1:36:25.600\n And so in that sense, it's infinite, even if it started out as a finite little dot.\n\n1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:29.720\n Not a dot, I'm sorry, a finite little hypersphere.\n\n1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:37.800\n But it didn't really start out there because what happened before that?\n\n1:36:37.800 --> 1:36:38.800\n Well, we don't know.\n\n1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:41.480\n So this is where it gets into a lot of speculation.\n\n1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:42.480\n Let's go, I mean...\n\n1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:43.480\n Let's go there.\n\n1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:44.480\n Okay, sure.\n\n1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:45.480\n So, you know...\n\n1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:50.440\n The idea of what happened before t equals zero and whether there are other universes\n\n1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:55.160\n out there, I like to say that these are sort of on the boundaries of science.\n\n1:36:55.160 --> 1:36:58.820\n They're not just ideas that we wake up at three in the morning to go to the bathroom\n\n1:36:58.820 --> 1:37:02.160\n and say, oh, well, let's think about what happened before the Big Bang or let there\n\n1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:04.880\n be a multiplicity of universes.\n\n1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:12.280\n In other words, we have real testable physics that we can use to draw certain conclusions\n\n1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:16.400\n that are plausibility arguments based on what we know.\n\n1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:24.160\n Now, admittedly, there are not really direct tests of these hypotheses.\n\n1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:26.040\n That's why I call them hypotheses.\n\n1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:30.980\n They're not really elevated to a theory because a theory in science is really something that\n\n1:37:30.980 --> 1:37:34.960\n has a lot of experimental or observational support behind it.\n\n1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:41.400\n So they're hypotheses, but they're not unreasonable hypotheses based on what we know about general\n\n1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:44.240\n relativity and quantum physics.\n\n1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:49.720\n And they may have indirect tests in that if you adopt this hypothesis, then there might\n\n1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:54.560\n be a bunch of things you expect of the universe, and lo and behold, that's what we measure.\n\n1:37:54.560 --> 1:38:00.620\n But we're not actually measuring anything at t less than zero, or we're not actually\n\n1:38:00.620 --> 1:38:05.780\n measuring the presence of another universe in this multiverse, and yet there are these\n\n1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:09.180\n indirect ideas that stem forth.\n\n1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:15.560\n So it's hard to prove uniqueness, and it's hard to completely convince oneself that a\n\n1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:19.540\n certain hypothesis must be true.\n\n1:38:19.540 --> 1:38:24.420\n But the more and more tests you have that it satisfies, let's say there are 50 predictions\n\n1:38:24.420 --> 1:38:30.360\n it makes, and 49 of them are things that you can measure.\n\n1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:35.640\n And then the 50th one is the one where you want to measure the actual existence of that\n\n1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:41.840\n other universe, or what happened before t equals zero, and you can't do that.\n\n1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:49.000\n But you've satisfied 49 of the other testable predictions, and so that's science, right?\n\n1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:53.680\n Now a conventional condensed matter physicist or someone who deals with real data in the\n\n1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:58.040\n laboratory might say, oh, you cosmologists, that's not really science because it's not\n\n1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:02.480\n directly testable, but I would say it's sort of testable.\n\n1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:06.040\n But it's not completely testable, and so it's at the boundary, but it's not like we're coming\n\n1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:11.980\n up with these crazy ideas, among them quantum fluctuations out of nothing, and then inflating\n\n1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:16.720\n into a universe with, you might say, well, you created a giant amount of energy.\n\n1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:22.800\n But in fact, this quantum fluctuation out of nothing in a quantum way violates the conservation\n\n1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:23.800\n of energy.\n\n1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:24.800\n But who cares?\n\n1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:26.600\n That was a classical law anyway.\n\n1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:32.760\n And then an inflating universe maintains whatever energy it had, be it zero or some infinitesimal\n\n1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:33.760\n amount.\n\n1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:38.800\n In a sense, the stuff of the universe has a positive energy, but there's a negative\n\n1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:41.280\n gravitational energy associated with it.\n\n1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:43.000\n It's like I drop an apple.\n\n1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.880\n I got kinetic energy, energy of motion out of that, but I did work on it to bring it\n\n1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:49.800\n to that height.\n\n1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:55.880\n So by going down and gaining energy of motion, positive one, two, three, four, five units\n\n1:39:55.880 --> 1:40:01.160\n of kinetic energy, it's also gaining or losing, depending on how you want to think of it,\n\n1:40:01.160 --> 1:40:06.200\n negative one, two, three, four, five units of potential energy, so the total energy remains\n\n1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:07.240\n the same.\n\n1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:12.260\n An inflating universe can do that, or other physicists say that energy isn't conserved\n\n1:40:12.260 --> 1:40:13.840\n in general relativity.\n\n1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:17.520\n That's another way out of creating a universe out of nothing.\n\n1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:22.920\n But the point is that this is all based on reasonably well tested physics, and although\n\n1:40:22.920 --> 1:40:30.080\n these extrapolations seem kind of outrageous at first, they're not completely outrageous.\n\n1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:33.600\n They're within the realm of what we call science already.\n\n1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:39.080\n And maybe some young whippersnapper will be able to figure out a way to directly test\n\n1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:44.060\n what happened before T equals zero or to test for the presence of these other universes,\n\n1:40:44.060 --> 1:40:46.460\n but right now we don't have a way of doing that.\n\n1:40:46.460 --> 1:40:52.040\n So speaking of young whippersnappers, Roger Penrose.\n\n1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:58.240\n So he kind of has a, you know, idea that we, there may be some information that travels\n\n1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:00.760\n from whatever the heck happened before the Big Bang.\n\n1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:01.760\n Yeah, maybe.\n\n1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:03.320\n I kind of doubt it.\n\n1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:09.480\n So do you think it's possible to detect something, like actually experimentally be able to detect\n\n1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:13.640\n some, I don't know what it is, radiation, some sort of...\n\n1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:18.240\n Yeah, and the cosmic microwave background radiation, there may be ways of doing that.\n\n1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:25.480\n But is it, is it philosophically or practically possible to detect signs that this was before\n\n1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:32.000\n the Big Bang or is it, or is it what you said, which is like everything we observe will,\n\n1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.200\n as we currently understand, will have to be a creation of this particular observable universe?\n\n1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:37.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:40.480\n I mean, you know, if you, it's very difficult to answer right now because we don't have\n\n1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:48.360\n a single verified, fully self consistent, experimentally tested quantum theory of gravity.\n\n1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:49.360\n Right.\n\n1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:53.600\n And of course the beginning of the universe is a large amount of stuff in a very small\n\n1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:54.600\n space.\n\n1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:55.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:57.120\n So you need both quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\n1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:01.400\n Same thing if our universe re collapses and then bounces back to another Big Bang.\n\n1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:06.320\n You know, there's also ideas there that some of the information leaks through or survives.\n\n1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:11.560\n I don't know that we can answer that question right now because we don't have a quantum\n\n1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:15.360\n theory of gravity that most physicists believe in.\n\n1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:20.600\n And belief is perhaps the wrong word that most physicists trust because the experimental\n\n1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:22.480\n evidence favors it.\n\n1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:23.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:24.480\n Right?\n\n1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:25.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:26.480\n There are various forms of string theory.\n\n1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:27.480\n There's quantum loop gravity.\n\n1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:33.240\n There are various ideas, but which, if any, will be the one that survives the test of\n\n1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:38.840\n time and more importantly, within that, the test of experiment and observation.\n\n1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:39.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:39.840 --> 1:42:43.280\n So my own feeling is probably these things don't survive.\n\n1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:47.400\n I don't think we've seen any evidence in the cosmic microwave background radiation\n\n1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:50.520\n of information leaking through.\n\n1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:55.880\n Similarly, the one way or one of the few ways in which we might test for the presence of\n\n1:42:55.880 --> 1:43:02.200\n other universes is if they were to collide with ours, that would leave a pattern, a temperature\n\n1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:05.920\n signature in the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\n1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:10.200\n Some astrophysicists claim to have found it, but in my opinion, it's not statistically\n\n1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:17.280\n significant to the level that would be necessary to have such an amazing claim, right?\n\n1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:22.960\n It's just a 5% chance that the microwave background had that distribution just by chance.\n\n1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:32.680\n 5% isn't very long odds if you're claiming that instead that you're finding evidence\n\n1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:33.680\n from another universe.\n\n1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:39.760\n I mean, it's like if the Large Hadron Collider people had claimed after gathering enough\n\n1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:47.780\n data to show the Higgs particle when there was a 5% chance it could be just a statistical\n\n1:43:47.780 --> 1:43:50.040\n fluctuation in their data.\n\n1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:57.640\n No, they required 5 sigma, 5 standard deviations, which is roughly one chance in 2 million that\n\n1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:04.280\n this is a statistical fluctuation of no physical greater significance.\n\n1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:05.560\n Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\n\n1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:06.560\n There you go.\n\n1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:07.560\n It all boils down to that.\n\n1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:12.420\n And the greater your claim, the greater is the evidence that is needed and the more evidence\n\n1:44:12.420 --> 1:44:20.640\n you need from independent ways of measuring or of coming to that deduction.\n\n1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:23.560\n A good example was the accelerating universe.\n\n1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:29.840\n When we found evidence for it in 1998 with supernovae with exploding stars, it was great\n\n1:44:29.840 --> 1:44:34.240\n that there were two teams that lent some credibility to the discovery.\n\n1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:41.200\n But it was not until other astrophysicists used not only that technique, but more importantly,\n\n1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:46.760\n other independent techniques that had their own potential sources of systematic error\n\n1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:47.940\n or whatever.\n\n1:44:47.940 --> 1:44:52.760\n But they all came to the same conclusion and that started giving a much more complete picture\n\n1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:59.220\n of what was going on and a picture in which most astrophysicists quickly gained confidence.\n\n1:44:59.220 --> 1:45:06.200\n That's why that idea caught on so quickly is that there were other physicists and astronomers\n\n1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:11.640\n doing observations completely independent of supernovae that seemed to indicate the\n\n1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:12.640\n same thing.\n\n1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:13.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:22.480\n That period of your life that work with an incredible team of people that won the Nobel\n\n1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:25.880\n Prize is just fascinating work.\n\n1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:26.880\n Oh gosh.\n\n1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:33.280\n Never in my wildest dreams as a kid did I think that I would be involved, much less\n\n1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:37.880\n so heavily involved, in a discovery that's so revolutionary.\n\n1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:41.760\n As a kid, as a scientist, if you're realistic, once you learn a little bit more about how\n\n1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:45.840\n science is done and you're not going to win a Nobel Prize and be the next Newton or Einstein\n\n1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:51.020\n or whatever, you just hope that you'll contribute something to humankind's understanding of\n\n1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:55.040\n how nature works and you'll be satisfied with that.\n\n1:45:55.040 --> 1:46:01.040\n But here I was in the right place at the right time, a lot of luck, a lot of hard work, and\n\n1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:02.180\n there it was.\n\n1:46:02.180 --> 1:46:08.400\n We discovered something that was really amazing and that was the greatest thrill, right?\n\n1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:14.060\n I couldn't have asked for anything more than being involved in that discovery.\n\n1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:20.200\n So the couple of teams, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the HiZ Supernova Search Team,\n\n1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:21.960\n what was the Nobel Prize given for?\n\n1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:27.280\n It was given for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, not for the elucidation\n\n1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:33.040\n of what dark energy is or what causes that expansion, that acceleration, be it universes\n\n1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:36.840\n on the outside or whatever, it was only for the observational fact.\n\n1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:39.200\n So first of all, what is the accelerating universe?\n\n1:46:39.200 --> 1:46:45.640\n So the accelerating universe is simply that if we look at the galaxies moving away from\n\n1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:52.120\n us right now, we would expect them to be moving away more slowly than they were billions of\n\n1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:53.120\n years ago.\n\n1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:58.080\n That's because galaxies have visible matter, which is gravitationally attractive, and dark\n\n1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:04.600\n matter of an unknown sort that holds galaxies together and holds clusters of galaxies together.\n\n1:47:04.600 --> 1:47:09.400\n And of course, they then pull on one another and they would tend to retard the expansion\n\n1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:10.400\n of the universe.\n\n1:47:10.400 --> 1:47:17.280\n Just as when I toss an apple up, even ignoring air resistance, the mutual gravitational attraction\n\n1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:20.640\n between Earth and the apple slows the apple down.\n\n1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:24.800\n If that attraction is great enough, then the apple will someday stop and even come back.\n\n1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:29.080\n The Big Crunch, you could call it, or the Gnab Gibb, which is Big Bang backwards, right?\n\n1:47:29.080 --> 1:47:30.520\n That's what could have happened to the universe.\n\n1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:36.860\n But even if the universe's original expansion energy was so great that it avoids the Big\n\n1:47:36.860 --> 1:47:39.800\n Crunch, that's like an apple thrown at Earth's escape speed.\n\n1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:47.040\n It's like the rockets that go to Mars someday, right, with people.\n\n1:47:47.040 --> 1:47:50.800\n Even then, you'd expect the universe to be slowing down with time.\n\n1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:55.600\n But we looked back through the history of the universe by looking at progressively more\n\n1:47:55.600 --> 1:48:06.000\n distant galaxies and by seeing that the evolution of this expansion rate is that in the first\n\n1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.340\n nine billion years, yeah, it was slowing down.\n\n1:48:09.340 --> 1:48:13.720\n But in the last five billion years, it's been speeding up.\n\n1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:17.320\n So who asked for that, right, you know?\n\n1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:22.080\n I think it's interesting to talk about a little bit of the human story of the Nobel Prize,\n\n1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:24.920\n which is, I mean, it's fascinating.\n\n1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:27.960\n It's a really, first of all, the prize itself.\n\n1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:34.040\n It's kind of fascinating on the psychological level that prizes, I know we kind of think\n\n1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:38.720\n that prizes don't matter, but somehow they kind of focus the mind about some of the most\n\n1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:39.720\n special things we've accomplished.\n\n1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:40.720\n They do.\n\n1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:43.200\n It's the recognition, the funding, you know.\n\n1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:47.580\n And also inspiration for, like I said, when I was a little kid, thinking about the Nobel\n\n1:48:47.580 --> 1:48:53.600\n Prize, like I didn't, you know, it inspires millions of young scientists.\n\n1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:59.200\n At the same time, there's a sadness to it a little bit that, especially in the field,\n\n1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:04.400\n like depending on the field, but experimental fields that involve teams of, I don't know,\n\n1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:12.200\n sometimes hundreds of brilliant people, the Nobel Prize is only given to just a handful.\n\n1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:13.200\n That's right.\n\n1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:14.760\n Is it maxed at three?\n\n1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:15.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:16.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:18.920\n And it's not even written in Alfred Nobel's will, it turns out.\n\n1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:23.960\n One of our teammates looked into it in a museum in Stockholm when we went there for Nobel\n\n1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:25.840\n Week in 2011.\n\n1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:30.560\n The leaders who got the prize formally knew that without the rest of us working hard in\n\n1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:35.080\n the trenches, the result would not have been discovered.\n\n1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:37.560\n So they invited us to participate in Nobel Week.\n\n1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:41.320\n And so one of the team members looked in the will and it's not there.\n\n1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:42.320\n It's just tradition.\n\n1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:43.320\n That's interesting.\n\n1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:47.080\n But it's archaic, you know, that's the way science used to be done.\n\n1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:49.320\n It's not the way a lot of science is done now.\n\n1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:54.700\n And you look at gravitational wave discovery, which was, you know, recognized with the Nobel\n\n1:49:54.700 --> 1:50:03.720\n Prize in 2017, Ray Weiss at MIT got it and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish at Caltech.\n\n1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:07.560\n And Ron Drever, one of the masterminds, had passed away earlier in the year.\n\n1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:13.840\n So again, one of the rules of Nobel is that it's not given posthumously, or at least the\n\n1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:17.960\n one exception might be if they've made their decision and they're busy making their press\n\n1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:23.460\n releases right before October, the first week in October or whatever, and then the person\n\n1:50:23.460 --> 1:50:24.460\n passes away.\n\n1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:25.920\n I think they don't change their minds then.\n\n1:50:25.920 --> 1:50:32.460\n But yeah, you know, it doesn't square with today's reality that a lot of science is done\n\n1:50:32.460 --> 1:50:35.800\n by big teams, in that case, a team of a thousand people.\n\n1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:40.160\n In our case, it was two teams consisting of about 50 people.\n\n1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:46.120\n And we used techniques that were arguably developed in part by people who, astrophysicists\n\n1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:51.320\n who weren't even on those two papers, I mean, some of them were, but other papers were written\n\n1:50:51.320 --> 1:50:56.560\n by other people, you know, and so it's like we're standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\n1:50:56.560 --> 1:50:59.520\n And none of those people was officially recognized.\n\n1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:01.800\n And to me, it was okay.\n\n1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:06.560\n You know, again, it was the thrill of doing the work and ultimately the work, the discovery\n\n1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:08.760\n was recognized with the prize.\n\n1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:14.360\n And you know, we got to participate in Nobel week and, you know, it's okay with me.\n\n1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:20.500\n I've known other physicists whose lives were ruined because they did not get the Nobel\n\n1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:23.840\n prize and they felt strongly that they should have.\n\n1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:31.560\n Ralph Alpher of the Alpher beta gamma paper predicting the microwave background radiation,\n\n1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:33.400\n we should have gotten it.\n\n1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:36.600\n His advisor Gamoff was dead by that point.\n\n1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:42.560\n But you know, Penzias and Wilson got it for the discovery and an Alpher, apparently from\n\n1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:45.120\n colleagues who knew him well, I've talked to them.\n\n1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:46.760\n His life was ruined by this.\n\n1:51:46.760 --> 1:51:50.840\n He just, it just not at his innards so much.\n\n1:51:50.840 --> 1:51:56.040\n It's very possible that in a small handful of people, even three, that you would be one\n\n1:51:56.040 --> 1:51:59.440\n of the Nobel, one of the winners of the Nobel prize.\n\n1:51:59.440 --> 1:52:00.920\n That doesn't weigh heavy on you.\n\n1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:05.080\n Well, you know, there were the two team leaders, Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt.\n\n1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:07.600\n And usually there's the team leaders that are recognized.\n\n1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:10.520\n And then Adam Rees was my postdoc.\n\n1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:11.520\n First author, I guess.\n\n1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:12.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:13.520\n First author.\n\n1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:14.520\n I was second author of that paper.\n\n1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:15.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:16.520\n So I was his direct mentor at the time.\n\n1:52:16.520 --> 1:52:19.920\n Although he was, you know, one of these people who just, you know, runs with things.\n\n1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:26.200\n He was an MIT undergraduate by the way, Harvard graduate student, and then a postdoc as a\n\n1:52:26.200 --> 1:52:30.840\n so called Miller fellow for basic research and science at Berkeley, something that I\n\n1:52:30.840 --> 1:52:33.240\n was back in 84 to 86.\n\n1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:37.680\n But you're, you know, you're largely a free agent, but he worked quite closely with me\n\n1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:43.000\n and he came to Berkeley to work with me and on Schmidt's team, he was charged with analyzing\n\n1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:48.440\n the data and he measured the brightnesses of these distant supernovae showing that they're\n\n1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:51.480\n fainter and thus more distant than anticipated.\n\n1:52:51.480 --> 1:52:56.420\n And that led to this conclusion that the universe had to have accelerated in order to push them\n\n1:52:56.420 --> 1:52:58.520\n out to such great distances.\n\n1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:04.800\n And I was shocked when he showed me the data, the results of his calculations and measurements.\n\n1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:07.000\n But it's very, you know, so he deserved it.\n\n1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:10.440\n And on Sol's team, Gerson Goldhaber deserved it.\n\n1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:14.840\n But he died, I think a year earlier in 2010, but that would have been four.\n\n1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:21.720\n And so, and me, well, I was on both teams, but, you know, was I number four, five, six,\n\n1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:22.720\n seven?\n\n1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:23.720\n I don't know.\n\n1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:28.800\n It's also very, so if I were to, it's possible that you're, I mean, I can make a very good\n\n1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:31.400\n case for urine in the three.\n\n1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:38.440\n And does that, is that psychologically, I mean, listen, it weighs on me a little bit\n\n1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:44.560\n because I don't know what to do with that.\n\n1:53:44.560 --> 1:53:51.120\n Perhaps it should motivate the rethinking, like Time magazine started doing like, you\n\n1:53:51.120 --> 1:53:56.120\n know, person of the year and like they would start doing like concepts and almost like\n\n1:53:56.120 --> 1:54:02.380\n the black hole gets the Nobel prize or the universe gets the Nobel prize and here's the\n\n1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:03.800\n list of people.\n\n1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:11.160\n So like, or like the Oscar that you could say, because it's a team effort now and it\n\n1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:12.160\n should be redone.\n\n1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:16.360\n And the breakthrough prize in fundamental physics, which was started by Yuri Milner\n\n1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:22.080\n and Zuckerberg is involved in others as well, you know, uh, they recognize the larger team.\n\n1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:24.440\n Yeah, they, they recognize teams.\n\n1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:28.840\n And so in fact, both teams in the accelerating universe were recognized with the breakthrough\n\n1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:31.480\n prize in 2015.\n\n1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:37.720\n Nevertheless, the same three people, Reese Perlmutter and Schmidt got the red carpet\n\n1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:43.480\n rolled out for them and were at the big ceremony and shared half of the prize money.\n\n1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:48.240\n And the rest of us, roughly 50 shared the other half and didn't get to go to the ceremony.\n\n1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:52.880\n So, but I, I feel for them, I mean, for the gravitational waves, it was a thousand people.\n\n1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:53.880\n What are they going to do?\n\n1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:55.980\n Invite everyone for the Higgs particle.\n\n1:54:55.980 --> 1:54:58.760\n It was six to 8,000 physicists and engineers.\n\n1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:04.500\n In fact, because of the whole issue of who gets it experimentally, that discovery still\n\n1:55:04.500 --> 1:55:06.620\n has not been recognized, right?\n\n1:55:06.620 --> 1:55:13.240\n The theoretical work by Peter Higgs and, uh, Anglaire got recognized, but there was a troika\n\n1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:18.240\n of other people who perhaps wrote the most complete paper and they were, they were left\n\n1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:22.360\n out and, um, another guy died, you know, and\n\n1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:23.360\n it's hard.\n\n1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:24.360\n It's all of his heartbreak.\n\n1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:28.400\n And some people argue that the Nobel prize has been diluted too, because if you look\n\n1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:33.600\n at Roger Penrose, you can make an argument that he should get the prize by himself.\n\n1:55:33.600 --> 1:55:37.720\n Like it's just separate those, like he could have and should have, perhaps he should have\n\n1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:41.720\n perhaps gotten it with Hawking before Hawking's death, right?\n\n1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:46.320\n The problem was Hawking radiation had not been detected, but you could argue that Hawking\n\n1:55:46.320 --> 1:55:52.240\n made enough other fundamental contributions to the theoretical study of black holes and\n\n1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:57.920\n the observed data were already good enough at the time of before Hawking's death.\n\n1:55:57.920 --> 1:55:58.920\n Okay.\n\n1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:03.280\n I mean, the latest results by Reinhard Genzel's group is that they see the time dilation effect\n\n1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:07.680\n of a star that's passing very close to the black hole in the middle of our galaxy.\n\n1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:13.240\n That's cool, but, and it adds additional evidence, but hardly anyone doubted the existence of\n\n1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:18.880\n the supermassive black hole and Andrea Gaz's group, I believe hadn't yet shown that relativistic\n\n1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:21.060\n effect and yet she got part of the prize as well.\n\n1:56:21.060 --> 1:56:25.560\n So clearly it was given for the, the original evidence that was really good.\n\n1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:30.320\n And that evidence is at least a decade old, you know, so one could make the case for,\n\n1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:37.460\n for Hawking, one could make the case that in 2016, when Mayor and Caloz won the Nobel\n\n1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:45.560\n Prize for the discovery of the first exoplanet, 51B Pegasi, well, there was a fellow at Penn\n\n1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:55.000\n State, Alex Wolszczan, who in 1992, three years preceding 1995, found a planet orbiting\n\n1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:59.920\n a pulsar, a very weird kind of star, a neutron star, and that wouldn't have been a normal\n\n1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:00.920\n planet.\n\n1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:01.920\n Sure.\n\n1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:05.840\n And so the Nobel committee, you know, they gave it for the discovery of planets around\n\n1:57:05.840 --> 1:57:11.160\n normal sun like stars, but, but hell, you know, Wolszczan found a planet so they could\n\n1:57:11.160 --> 1:57:16.520\n have given it to him as the third person instead of to Jim Peebles for the development of what's\n\n1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:18.360\n called physical cosmology.\n\n1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:22.860\n He's at Princeton, he deserved it, but they could have given Nobel for the development\n\n1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:27.920\n of physical cosmology to Peebles and I would claim some other people were pretty important\n\n1:57:27.920 --> 1:57:29.000\n in that development as well.\n\n1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:32.600\n You know, and they could have given it some other year.\n\n1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:35.040\n So there's, there's a lot of controversy.\n\n1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:36.600\n I try not to dwell on it.\n\n1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:37.760\n Was I number three?\n\n1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:38.760\n Probably not.\n\n1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:40.680\n You know, Adam Riess did the work.\n\n1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:46.040\n You know, I helped bounce ideas off of him, but we wouldn't have had the result without\n\n1:57:46.040 --> 1:57:47.040\n him.\n\n1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:48.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:57:48.040 --> 1:57:53.360\n And I was on both teams for reasons, I mean, you know, I, the style of the first team,\n\n1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:56.320\n the supernova cosmology project didn't match mine.\n\n1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:00.520\n They came largely from experimental high energy particle physics, physics where there's these\n\n1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:05.440\n hierarchical teams and stuff and it's hard for the little guy to have a say, at least\n\n1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:06.960\n that's what I kind of thought.\n\n1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:12.200\n Whereas the team of astronomers led by Brian Schmidt was first of all, a bunch of my friends\n\n1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:18.320\n and they grew up as astronomers making contributions on little teams and we decided to band together,\n\n1:58:18.320 --> 1:58:20.440\n but all of us had our voices heard.\n\n1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:25.480\n So it was sort of a culture, a style that I preferred really.\n\n1:58:25.480 --> 1:58:30.240\n But let me tell you a story at the Nobel banquet, okay?\n\n1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:35.020\n I'm sitting there between two physicists who are members of the committee of the Swedish\n\n1:58:35.020 --> 1:58:39.920\n National Academy of Sciences, you know, and I strategically kept, you know, offering them\n\n1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:45.080\n wine and stuff during this long drawn out Nobel ceremony, right?\n\n1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:50.080\n And I got them to be pretty talkative and then in a polite diplomatic way, I started\n\n1:58:50.080 --> 1:58:55.840\n asking them pointed questions and basically they admitted that if there are four or more\n\n1:58:55.840 --> 1:59:01.600\n people equally deserving, they wait for one of them to die or they just don't give the\n\n1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:07.040\n prize at all when it's unclear who the three are, at least unclear to them.\n\n1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:12.400\n But unclear to them, they're not even right part of the time.\n\n1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:20.920\n I mean, Jocelyn Bell discovered pulsars with a radio antenna, a set of radio antennas that\n\n1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:28.800\n her advisor Anthony Hewish conceived and built, so he deserves some credit, but he didn't\n\n1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:30.520\n discover the pulsar.\n\n1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:31.520\n She did.\n\n1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:38.400\n And his initial reaction to the data that she showed him was a condescending rubbish,\n\n1:59:38.400 --> 1:59:39.400\n my dear.\n\n1:59:39.400 --> 1:59:41.400\n Yeah, I'm not kidding.\n\n1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:46.960\n Now, I know Jocelyn Bell and she did not let this destroy her life.\n\n1:59:46.960 --> 1:59:51.080\n She won every other prize under the sun, okay?\n\n1:59:51.080 --> 1:59:57.320\n Vera Rubin, arguably one of the discoverers of dark matter, although there, if you look\n\n1:59:57.320 --> 2:00:00.520\n at the history, there were a number of people and that was the issue, I think there were\n\n2:00:00.520 --> 2:00:06.480\n a number of people, four or more who had similar data and similar ideas at about the same time.\n\n2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:12.440\n Rubin won every prize under the sun, the new big large scale survey telescope being built\n\n2:00:12.440 --> 2:00:19.080\n in Chile is being renamed the Vera Rubin Telescope because she passed away in December of 2015,\n\n2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:21.880\n I think.\n\n2:00:21.880 --> 2:00:26.620\n You know, it'll conduct this survey, large scale survey with the Rubin Telescope.\n\n2:00:26.620 --> 2:00:30.120\n So she's been recognized, but never with the Nobel Prize.\n\n2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:36.000\n And I would say that to her credit, she did not let that consume her life either.\n\n2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:41.200\n And perhaps it was a bit easier because there had been no Nobel given for the discovery\n\n2:00:41.200 --> 2:00:46.840\n of dark matter, whereas in the case of pulsars and Jocelyn Bell, there was a prize given\n\n2:00:46.840 --> 2:00:50.560\n for the discovery of the freaking pulsars and she didn't get it.\n\n2:00:50.560 --> 2:00:53.080\n Well, I mean, what a travesty of justice.\n\n2:00:53.080 --> 2:01:01.840\n So I also think as a fan of fiction, as a fan of stories that the travesty and the tragedy\n\n2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:11.240\n and the unfairness and the tension of it is what makes the prize and similar prizes beautiful.\n\n2:01:11.240 --> 2:01:19.200\n The decisions of other humans that result in dreams being broken and, you know, like\n\n2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:24.600\n that's why we love the Olympics as so many, you know, people, athletes give their whole\n\n2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:31.280\n life for this particular moment and then there's referee decisions and like little slips of\n\n2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:36.400\n here and there, like the little misfortunes that destroy entire dreams.\n\n2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.360\n And that's, it's, it's weird to say, but it feels like that makes the entirety of it even\n\n2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:43.360\n more special.\n\n2:01:43.360 --> 2:01:44.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:46.720\n If it was perfect, it wouldn't be interesting.\n\n2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:51.160\n Humans like competition and they like heroes and unfortunately it gives the impression\n\n2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:57.720\n to youngsters today that science is still done by white men with gray beards wearing\n\n2:01:57.720 --> 2:01:59.200\n white lab coats.\n\n2:01:59.200 --> 2:02:04.080\n And I'm very pleased to see that this year, you know, Andrea Ghez, the fourth woman in\n\n2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:07.520\n the history of the physics prize to have received it.\n\n2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:14.000\n And then two women, one at Berkeley, one elsewhere won the Nobel prize in chemistry without any\n\n2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.040\n male co recipient.\n\n2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:21.400\n And so that's sending a message I think to girls that they can do science and they have\n\n2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:23.600\n role models.\n\n2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:31.240\n I think the breakthrough prize and other such prizes show that teams get recognized as well.\n\n2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:37.120\n And if you pay attention to the newspapers, you know, most of the good authors like, you\n\n2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:41.520\n know, Dennis Overby of the New York Times and others said that these were teams of people\n\n2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:46.040\n and they, they emphasize that and, you know, they all played a role.\n\n2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:49.920\n And you know, maybe if some grad student hadn't soldered some circuit, maybe the whole thing\n\n2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:52.220\n wouldn't have worked, you know.\n\n2:02:52.220 --> 2:02:59.800\n But still, you know, Ray Weiss and Kip Thorne was the theoretical, you know, impetus for\n\n2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:05.860\n the whole search for gravitational waves, Barry Barish brought the MIT and Caltech teams\n\n2:03:05.860 --> 2:03:11.080\n together to get them to cooperate at a time when the project was nearly dead from what\n\n2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:16.120\n I understand and contributed greatly to the experimental setup as well.\n\n2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:20.280\n He's a great experimental physicist, but he was really good at bringing these two teams\n\n2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:24.280\n together instead of having them duke it out in blows and leaving both of them bleeding\n\n2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:25.280\n and dying.\n\n2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:29.680\n You know, the National Science Foundation was going to cut the funding from what I understand,\n\n2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:30.680\n you know.\n\n2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:33.880\n So, so there's human drama involved in this whole thing.\n\n2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:38.960\n And the Olympics, yeah, you know, a runner, a swimmer, a runner, runner, you know, they\n\n2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:43.720\n slip just at the moment that they were taking off from the first thing and that costs them\n\n2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:46.400\n some fraction of a second and that's it.\n\n2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:47.560\n They didn't win, you know.\n\n2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:53.920\n And in that case, I mean, the coaches, the families, which I met a lot of Olympic athletes\n\n2:03:53.920 --> 2:04:01.280\n and the coaches and the families of the athletes are really the winners of the medals.\n\n2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:06.240\n But they don't get the medal and it's, you know, credit assignment is a fascinating thing.\n\n2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:10.040\n I mean, that's the full human story we have.\n\n2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:13.520\n And outside of prizes, it's fascinating.\n\n2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:18.080\n I mean, just to be in the middle of it for artificial intelligence, there's a field of\n\n2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:19.080\n deep learning.\n\n2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:20.080\n That's really exciting.\n\n2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:26.320\n And people have been, there's yet another award, the touring awards given for deep learning\n\n2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:32.560\n to three folks who are very much responsible for the field, but so are a lot of others.\n\n2:04:32.560 --> 2:04:33.960\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:43.480\n And there's a few, there's a, there's a fellow by the name of Schmidt Huber who sort of symbolizes\n\n2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:48.880\n the, the forgotten folks in the deep learning community.\n\n2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:55.040\n But you know, that's, that's the unfortunate sad thing where you remember, remember Isaac\n\n2:04:55.040 --> 2:05:04.080\n Newton or remember these, these, these special figures and the ones that flew close to them,\n\n2:05:04.080 --> 2:05:05.080\n we forget.\n\n2:05:05.080 --> 2:05:06.080\n Well, that's right.\n\n2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:10.220\n And you know, often the breakthroughs are made based on the body of knowledge that had\n\n2:05:10.220 --> 2:05:13.320\n been assimilated prior to that.\n\n2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:15.840\n But you know, again, people like to worship heroes.\n\n2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:21.800\n You mentioned the Oscars earlier and you know, you look at the direct, I mean, well, I mean,\n\n2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:26.520\n okay, directors and stuff sometimes get awards and stuff, but you know, you look at even\n\n2:05:26.520 --> 2:05:30.320\n something like, I don't know, songwriters, musicians, Elton John or something, right?\n\n2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:32.240\n Bernie Taupin, right?\n\n2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:39.800\n Wrote many of the words or he's not as well known or the Beatles or something like that.\n\n2:05:39.800 --> 2:05:43.400\n I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn't write most of the songs.\n\n2:05:43.400 --> 2:05:44.400\n Yeah, Elvis.\n\n2:05:44.400 --> 2:05:45.400\n That's right.\n\n2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:46.400\n There you go.\n\n2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:47.400\n But he was the king, right?\n\n2:05:47.400 --> 2:05:50.840\n And he had such a personality and it was such a performer, right?\n\n2:05:50.840 --> 2:05:53.880\n But it's the unsung heroes in many cases.\n\n2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:54.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:54.880 --> 2:06:00.480\n So maybe taking a step back, we talked about the Nobel prize of the accelerating universe,\n\n2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:11.040\n but your work and the ideas around supernova were important in detecting this accelerating\n\n2:06:11.040 --> 2:06:12.040\n universe.\n\n2:06:12.040 --> 2:06:17.480\n Can we go to the very basics of what is this beautiful, mysterious object of a supernova?\n\n2:06:17.480 --> 2:06:18.480\n Right.\n\n2:06:18.480 --> 2:06:21.160\n So a supernova is an exploding star.\n\n2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:25.660\n Most stars die a relatively quiet death, our own sun, well, despite the fact that it'll\n\n2:06:25.660 --> 2:06:30.360\n become a red giant and incinerate earth, it'll do that reasonably slowly.\n\n2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:35.860\n But there's a small minority of stars that end their lives in a Titanic explosion.\n\n2:06:35.860 --> 2:06:40.880\n And that's not only exciting to watch from afar, but it's critical to our existence because\n\n2:06:40.880 --> 2:06:46.960\n it is in these explosions that the heavy elements synthesize through nuclear reactions during\n\n2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:52.640\n the normal course of the star's evolution and during the explosion itself, get injected\n\n2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:59.560\n into the cosmos, making them available as raw material for new stars, planets, and ultimately\n\n2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:00.560\n life.\n\n2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:04.880\n And that's just a great story, the best in some ways.\n\n2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:11.040\n So we like to study these things and our origins, but it turns out these are incredibly useful\n\n2:07:11.040 --> 2:07:19.640\n beacons as well, because if you know how powerful an exploding star really is by measuring the\n\n2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:25.680\n apparent brightness at its peak in galaxies whose distances we already know through having\n\n2:07:25.680 --> 2:07:32.040\n made other measurements, and you can thus calibrate how powerful the thing really is,\n\n2:07:32.040 --> 2:07:38.360\n and then you find ones that are much more distant, then you can use their observed brightness\n\n2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:43.780\n compared with their true intrinsic power or luminosity to judge their distance and hence\n\n2:07:43.780 --> 2:07:49.160\n the distance of the galaxy in which they're located.\n\n2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:51.980\n Let me just give this one analogy.\n\n2:07:51.980 --> 2:07:57.160\n You judge the distance of an oncoming car at night by looking at how bright its headlights\n\n2:07:57.160 --> 2:08:02.600\n appear to be, and you've calibrated how bright the headlights are of a car that's two or\n\n2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:07.760\n three meters away of known distance, and you go, oh, that's a faint headlight, and so that's\n\n2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:09.120\n pretty far away.\n\n2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:14.120\n You also use the apparent angular separation between the two headlights as a consistency\n\n2:08:14.120 --> 2:08:16.720\n check in your brain, but that's what your brain is doing.\n\n2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:19.760\n So we can do that for cars, we can do that for stars.\n\n2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:21.720\n Nice, I like that.\n\n2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:28.480\n But you know, with cars, the headlights are all, there's some variation, but they're somewhat\n\n2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:32.480\n similar so you can make those kinds of conclusions.\n\n2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:38.880\n How much variation is there between supernova that you can detect them?\n\n2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:42.800\n Right, so first of all, there are several different ways that stars can explode, and\n\n2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:47.540\n it depends on their mass and whether they're in a binary system and things like that.\n\n2:08:47.540 --> 2:08:52.840\n And the ones that we used for these cosmological purposes, studying the expansion of the history\n\n2:08:52.840 --> 2:09:00.560\n of the universe, are the so called type Roman numeral I, lowercase a, type Ia supernovae.\n\n2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:04.340\n They come from a weird type of a star called a white dwarf.\n\n2:09:04.340 --> 2:09:09.080\n Our own sun will turn into a white dwarf in about seven billion years.\n\n2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:14.920\n It'll have about half its present mass compressed into a volume just the size of Earth.\n\n2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:17.120\n So that's an inordinate density, okay?\n\n2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:18.880\n It's incredibly dense.\n\n2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:23.400\n And the matter is what's called by quantum physicists degenerate matter, not because\n\n2:09:23.400 --> 2:09:28.400\n it's morally reprehensible or anything like that, but this is just the name that quantum\n\n2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:33.000\n physicists give to electrons that are squeezed into a very tight space.\n\n2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:39.240\n The electrons take on a motion due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and also due to the\n\n2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:43.860\n Pauli exclusion principle that electrons don't like to be in the same place, they like to\n\n2:09:43.860 --> 2:09:44.860\n avoid each other.\n\n2:09:44.860 --> 2:09:50.280\n And those two things mean that a lot of electrons are moving very rapidly, which gives the star\n\n2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:56.040\n an extra pressure far above the thermal pressure associated with just the random motions of\n\n2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:57.920\n particles inside the star.\n\n2:09:57.920 --> 2:10:04.680\n So it's a weird type of star, but normally it wouldn't explode and our sun won't explode,\n\n2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:10.240\n except that if such a white dwarf is in a pair with another more or less normal star,\n\n2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:18.760\n it can steal material from that normal star until it gets to an unstable limit, roughly\n\n2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:22.460\n one and a half times the mass of our sun, 1.4 or so.\n\n2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:29.200\n This is known as the Chandrasekhar limit after Subramanian Chandrasekhar, an Indian astrophysicist\n\n2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:34.960\n who figured this out when he was about 20 years old on a voyage from India to England\n\n2:10:34.960 --> 2:10:37.000\n where he was to be educated.\n\n2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:42.520\n And then he did this and then 50 years later he won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1984\n\n2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:48.600\n largely for this work that he did as a youngster who was on his way to be educated.\n\n2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:54.440\n And his advisor, the great Arthur Eddington in England, who had done a lot of great things\n\n2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:59.640\n and was a great astrophysicist, nevertheless, he too was human and had his faults.\n\n2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:07.400\n He ridiculed Chandra's scientific work at a conference in England and most of us, if\n\n2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:12.760\n we had been Chandra, would have just given up astrophysics at that time when the great\n\n2:11:12.760 --> 2:11:16.880\n Arthur Eddington ridicules our work.\n\n2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:19.960\n That's another inspirational story for the youngster.\n\n2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:20.960\n Just keep going.\n\n2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:28.960\n But anyway, no matter what your advisor says or don't always pay attention to your advisor.\n\n2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:32.520\n Don't lose hope if you really think you're onto something.\n\n2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:34.360\n That doesn't mean never listen to your advisor.\n\n2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.720\n They may have sage advice as well.\n\n2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:43.540\n But anyway, when a white dwarf grows to a certain mass, it becomes unstable.\n\n2:11:43.540 --> 2:11:48.960\n And one of the ways it can end its life is to go through a thermonuclear runaway.\n\n2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:54.960\n So basically, the carbon nuclei inside the white dwarf start fusing together to form\n\n2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:56.880\n heavier nuclei.\n\n2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:06.800\n And the energy that those fusion reactions emit doesn't go into being dissipated out\n\n2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:14.120\n of the star or expanding it the way if you take a blowtorch to the middle of the Sun,\n\n2:12:14.120 --> 2:12:17.640\n you heat up its gases, the gases would expand and cool.\n\n2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:21.240\n But this degenerate star can't expand and cool.\n\n2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:27.200\n And so the energy pumped in through these fusion reactions goes into making the nuclei\n\n2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:28.560\n move faster.\n\n2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:33.880\n And that gets more of them sufficiently close together that they can undergo nuclear fusion,\n\n2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:38.880\n thereby releasing more energy that goes into speeding up more nuclei.\n\n2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:46.440\n And thus you have a runaway, a bomb, an uncontrolled fusion reactor instead of the controlled fusion,\n\n2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:48.360\n which is what our Sun does.\n\n2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:51.420\n Our Sun is a marvelous controlled fusion reactor.\n\n2:12:51.420 --> 2:12:56.280\n This is what we need here on Earth, fusion energy to solve our energy crisis, right?\n\n2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:01.100\n But the Sun holds the stuff in through gravity and you need a big mass to do that.\n\n2:13:01.100 --> 2:13:07.600\n So this uncontrolled fusion reaction blows up a star that's pretty much the same in\n\n2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:09.640\n all cases.\n\n2:13:09.640 --> 2:13:13.000\n And you measure it to be almost the same in all cases.\n\n2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:18.940\n But the devil is in the details, and in fact, we observe them to not be all the same.\n\n2:13:18.940 --> 2:13:23.360\n And theoretically, they might not be all the same because the rate of the fusion reactions\n\n2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:28.600\n might depend on the amount of trace heavier elements in the white dwarf.\n\n2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:33.440\n And that could depend on how old it is, whether it was born billions of years ago when there\n\n2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:38.300\n weren't many heavier elements or whether it's a relatively young white dwarf and all\n\n2:13:38.300 --> 2:13:40.080\n kinds of other things.\n\n2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:44.940\n And part of my work was to show that indeed, not all the Type Ia's are the same.\n\n2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:47.520\n You have to be careful when you use them.\n\n2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:49.160\n You have to calibrate them.\n\n2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:55.460\n They're not standard candles the way it just, if all headlights or all candles were the\n\n2:13:55.460 --> 2:13:59.900\n same lumens or whatever, you'd say they're standard and then it would be relative.\n\n2:13:59.900 --> 2:14:01.940\n Standard candles is an awesome term, okay.\n\n2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:05.700\n Standard candles is what astronomers like to say, but I don't like that term because\n\n2:14:05.700 --> 2:14:10.240\n there aren't any standard candles, but there are standardizable candles.\n\n2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:17.800\n And by looking at these type Ia's, you look at enough of them in nearby galaxies whose\n\n2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:20.640\n distances you know independently.\n\n2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:25.220\n And what you can tell is that, you know, this is something that a colleague of mine, Mark\n\n2:14:25.220 --> 2:14:30.560\n Phillips did who was on Schmidt's team and arguably was one of the people who deserved\n\n2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:31.560\n the Nobel Prize.\n\n2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:39.720\n He showed that the intrinsically more powerful Type Ia's decline in brightness, and it turns\n\n2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:45.080\n out rise in brightness as well, more slowly than the less luminous Ia's.\n\n2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:50.260\n And so if you calibrate this by measuring a whole bunch of nearby ones and then you\n\n2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:56.120\n look at a distant one, instead of saying, well, it's a 100 watt Type Ia supernova, they're\n\n2:14:56.120 --> 2:15:01.440\n much more powerful than that by the way, plus or minus 50, you can say, no, it's a hundred\n\n2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:08.940\n and 12 plus or minus 15, or it's 84 plus or minus 17.\n\n2:15:08.940 --> 2:15:15.240\n It tells you where it is in the power scale and it greatly decreases the uncertainties.\n\n2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:18.720\n And that's what makes these things cosmologically useful.\n\n2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:24.080\n I showed that if you spread the light out into a spectrum, you can tell spectroscopically\n\n2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:26.560\n that these things are different as well.\n\n2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:33.580\n And in 1991, I happened to study two of the extreme peculiar ones, the low luminosity\n\n2:15:33.580 --> 2:15:40.560\n ones and the high luminosity ones, 1991BG and 1991T.\n\n2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:43.520\n This showed that not all the Ia's are the same.\n\n2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:50.520\n And indeed, at the time of 1991, I was a little bit skeptical that we could use Type Ia's\n\n2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:53.120\n because of this diversity that I was observing.\n\n2:15:53.120 --> 2:16:00.080\n But in 1993, Mark Phillips wrote a paper that showed this correlation between the light\n\n2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:03.760\n curve, the brightness versus time and the peak luminosity.\n\n2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:05.920\n Which gives you enough information to calibrate.\n\n2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:08.280\n Then they become calibratable and that was a game changer.\n\n2:16:08.280 --> 2:16:12.320\n How many Type Ia's are out there to use for data?\n\n2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:19.840\n Now there are thousands of them, but at the time, the high Z team had 16 and the supernova\n\n2:16:19.840 --> 2:16:22.640\n cosmology project had 40.\n\n2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:25.840\n But the 16 were better measured than the 40.\n\n2:16:25.840 --> 2:16:31.080\n And so our statistical uncertainties were comparable if you look at the two papers that\n\n2:16:31.080 --> 2:16:32.080\n were published.\n\n2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:38.760\n How does that make you feel that there's these gigantic explosions just sprinkled out there?\n\n2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:43.380\n Well, I certainly don't want one to be very nearby and it would have to be within something\n\n2:16:43.380 --> 2:16:46.400\n like 10 light years to be an existential threat.\n\n2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:48.960\n So they can happen in our galaxy?\n\n2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:49.960\n Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:52.480\n So they would be okay?\n\n2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:57.160\n In most cases we'd be okay because our galaxy is 100,000 light years across.\n\n2:16:57.160 --> 2:17:01.360\n And you'd need one of these things to be within about 10 light years to be an existential\n\n2:17:01.360 --> 2:17:02.360\n threat.\n\n2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:07.040\n And it gives birth to a bunch of other stars, I guess?\n\n2:17:07.040 --> 2:17:11.060\n Yeah, it gives birth to expanding gases that are chemically enriched and those expanding\n\n2:17:11.060 --> 2:17:17.520\n gases mixed with other chemically enriched expanding gases or primordial clouds of hydrogen\n\n2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:18.520\n and helium.\n\n2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:24.800\n I mean, this is in a sense the greatest story ever told, right?\n\n2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:29.840\n I teach this introductory astronomy course at Berkeley and I tell them there's only five\n\n2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:34.660\n or six things that I want them to really understand and remember and I'm going to come to their\n\n2:17:34.660 --> 2:17:39.020\n deathbed and I'm going to ask them about this and if they get it wrong, I will retroactively\n\n2:17:39.020 --> 2:17:42.240\n fail and their whole career will have been shot.\n\n2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:43.240\n That's a student's worst nightmare.\n\n2:17:43.240 --> 2:17:46.680\n If they don't know and observe a total solar eclipse and yet they had the opportunity to\n\n2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:49.080\n do so, I will retroactively fail them.\n\n2:17:49.080 --> 2:17:51.800\n But one of them is, where did we come from?\n\n2:17:51.800 --> 2:17:54.560\n Where did the elements in our DNA come from?\n\n2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:59.480\n The carbon in our cells, the oxygen that we breathe, the calcium in our bones, the iron\n\n2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:01.780\n in our red blood cells.\n\n2:18:01.780 --> 2:18:07.680\n Those elements, the phosphorus in our DNA, they all came from stars, from nuclear reactions\n\n2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:15.280\n in stars and they were ejected into the cosmos and in some cases, like iron, made during\n\n2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:22.200\n the explosions and those gases drifted out, mixed with other clouds, made a new star or\n\n2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:30.240\n a star cluster, some of whose members then evolved and exploded, thus enriching the gases\n\n2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:35.120\n in the galaxy progressively more with time until finally, four and a half billion years\n\n2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:41.560\n ago from one of these chemically enriched clouds, our solar system formed with a rocky\n\n2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:49.440\n earthlike planet and somewhere, somehow, these self replicating, evolving molecules, bacteria\n\n2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:58.940\n formed and evolved through paramecia and amoebas and slugs and apes and us.\n\n2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:05.040\n And here we are, sentient beings that can ask these questions about our very origins\n\n2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:12.540\n and with our intellect and with the machines we make, come to a reasonable understanding\n\n2:19:12.540 --> 2:19:15.080\n of our origins.\n\n2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:16.640\n What a beautiful story.\n\n2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:24.280\n I mean, if that does not put you at least in awe, if not in love with science and its\n\n2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:30.100\n power of deduction, I don't know what will, right?\n\n2:19:30.100 --> 2:19:33.040\n It's one of the greatest stories, if not the greatest story.\n\n2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:38.040\n Obviously, that's personality dependent and all that, it's a subjective opinion, but it's\n\n2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:41.280\n perhaps the greatest story ever told.\n\n2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:45.040\n I mean, you could link it to the Big Bang and go even farther, right, to make an even\n\n2:19:45.040 --> 2:19:51.600\n more complete story, but as a subset, that's even in some ways a greater story than even\n\n2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:56.280\n the existence of the universe in some ways, because you could just imagine some really\n\n2:19:56.280 --> 2:20:01.300\n boring universe that never leads to sentient creatures such as ourselves.\n\n2:20:01.300 --> 2:20:06.880\n And is a supernova usually the introduction to that story?\n\n2:20:06.880 --> 2:20:12.200\n So are they usually the thing that launches the, is there other engines of creation?\n\n2:20:12.200 --> 2:20:18.360\n Well, the supernova is the one, I mean, I touch upon the subject earlier in my course,\n\n2:20:18.360 --> 2:20:22.880\n in fact, right about now in my lectures, because I talk about how our sun right now is fusing\n\n2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:29.440\n hydrogen to form helium nuclei and later it'll form carbon and oxygen nuclei, but that's\n\n2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:34.160\n where the process will stop for our sun, it's not massive enough, some stars that are more\n\n2:20:34.160 --> 2:20:37.060\n massive can go somewhat beyond that.\n\n2:20:37.060 --> 2:20:42.760\n So that's the beginning of this idea of the birth of the heavy elements, since they couldn't\n\n2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:47.480\n have been born at the time of the Big Bang, conditions of temperature and pressure weren't\n\n2:20:47.480 --> 2:20:51.960\n sufficient to make any significant quantities of the heavier elements.\n\n2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:57.480\n And so that's the beginning, but then you need some of these stars to explode, right?\n\n2:20:57.480 --> 2:21:03.020\n Because if those heavy elements remained forever trapped in the cores of stars, then they would\n\n2:21:03.020 --> 2:21:08.920\n not be available for the production of new stars, planets, and ultimately life.\n\n2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:17.400\n So indeed the supernova, my main area of interest, plays a leading role in this whole story.\n\n2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:22.520\n I saw that you got a chance to call Richard Feynman a mentor of yours when you were at\n\n2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:23.520\n Caltech.\n\n2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:24.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:28.880\n Do you have any fond memories of Feynman, any lessons that stick with you?\n\n2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:36.040\n Oh yeah, he was quite a character and one of the deepest thinkers of all time probably,\n\n2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:42.840\n and at least in my life, the physicist who had the single most intuitive understanding\n\n2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:48.960\n of how nature works of anyone I've met.\n\n2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:53.240\n I learned a number of things from him, he was not my thesis advisor, I worked with Wallace\n\n2:21:53.240 --> 2:21:58.140\n Sargent at Caltech on what are called active galaxies, big black holes in the centers of\n\n2:21:58.140 --> 2:22:03.180\n galaxies that are accreting or swallowing material, a little bit like the stuff of this\n\n2:22:03.180 --> 2:22:06.860\n year's Nobel Prize in Physics 2020.\n\n2:22:06.860 --> 2:22:12.180\n But Feynman I had for two courses, one was general theory of relativity at the graduate\n\n2:22:12.180 --> 2:22:18.100\n level and one was applications of quantum physics to all kinds of interesting things.\n\n2:22:18.100 --> 2:22:28.880\n And he had this very intuitive way of looking at things that he tried to bring to his students\n\n2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:38.200\n and he felt that if you can't explain something in a reasonably simple way to a non scientist\n\n2:22:38.200 --> 2:22:43.680\n or at least someone who is versed a little bit with science but is not a professional\n\n2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:49.420\n scientist then you probably don't understand it very well yourself very thoroughly.\n\n2:22:49.420 --> 2:22:58.400\n So that in me made a desire to be able to explain science to the general public and\n\n2:22:58.400 --> 2:23:02.580\n I've often found that in explaining things, yeah, there's a certain part that I didn't\n\n2:23:02.580 --> 2:23:06.760\n really understand myself, that's one reason I like to teach the introductory courses to\n\n2:23:06.760 --> 2:23:12.700\n the lay public is that I sometimes find that my explanations are lacking in my own mind.\n\n2:23:12.700 --> 2:23:14.180\n So he did that for me.\n\n2:23:14.180 --> 2:23:18.220\n Is there a, if I could just pause for a second, you said he had one of the most intuitive\n\n2:23:18.220 --> 2:23:20.820\n understanding of nature.\n\n2:23:20.820 --> 2:23:26.940\n What if you could break apart what intuitive means, like is that on the philosophical level?\n\n2:23:26.940 --> 2:23:28.580\n No, sort of physical.\n\n2:23:28.580 --> 2:23:33.660\n How do you draw a mental picture or a picture on paper of what's going on?\n\n2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:39.000\n And he's perhaps most famous in this regard for his Feynman diagrams, which in what's\n\n2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:44.140\n called quantum electrodynamics, a quantum field theory of electricity and magnetism.\n\n2:23:44.140 --> 2:23:48.800\n What you have are actually an exchange of photons between charged particles and they\n\n2:23:48.800 --> 2:23:55.500\n might even be virtual photons if the particles are at rest relative to one another.\n\n2:23:55.500 --> 2:24:00.140\n And there are ways of doing calculations that are brute force that take pages on pages and\n\n2:24:00.140 --> 2:24:02.340\n pages of calculations.\n\n2:24:02.340 --> 2:24:06.780\n And Julian Schwinger developed some of the mathematics for that and won the Nobel prize\n\n2:24:06.780 --> 2:24:07.780\n for it.\n\n2:24:07.780 --> 2:24:12.500\n But Feynman had these diagrams that he made and he had a set of rules of what to do at\n\n2:24:12.500 --> 2:24:13.500\n the vertex.\n\n2:24:13.500 --> 2:24:17.020\n You'd have two particles coming together and then a particle going out and then two particles\n\n2:24:17.020 --> 2:24:18.020\n coming out again.\n\n2:24:18.020 --> 2:24:22.100\n And he'd have these rules associated when there were vertices and when there were particles\n\n2:24:22.100 --> 2:24:24.380\n splitting off from one another and all that.\n\n2:24:24.380 --> 2:24:27.920\n And it looked a little bit like a bunch of a hodgepodge at first.\n\n2:24:27.920 --> 2:24:34.220\n But to those who learned the rules and understood them, they saw that you could do these complex\n\n2:24:34.220 --> 2:24:37.340\n calculations in a much simpler way.\n\n2:24:37.340 --> 2:24:42.700\n And indeed, in some ways, Freeman Dyson had an even better knack for explaining really\n\n2:24:42.700 --> 2:24:46.180\n what quantum electrodynamics actually was.\n\n2:24:46.180 --> 2:24:48.300\n But I didn't know Freeman Dyson.\n\n2:24:48.300 --> 2:24:49.300\n I knew Feynman.\n\n2:24:49.300 --> 2:24:52.920\n Maybe he did have a more intuitive view of the world than Feynman did.\n\n2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:58.860\n But of the people I knew, Feynman was the most intuitive, most sort of, is there a picture?\n\n2:24:58.860 --> 2:25:01.980\n Is there a simple way you can understand this?\n\n2:25:01.980 --> 2:25:10.580\n In the path that a particle follows even, you can get the classical path, at least for\n\n2:25:10.580 --> 2:25:14.700\n a baseball or something like that, by using quantum physics if you want.\n\n2:25:14.700 --> 2:25:19.740\n But in a sense, the baseball sniffs out all possible paths.\n\n2:25:19.740 --> 2:25:23.060\n It goes out to the Andromeda galaxy and then goes to the batter.\n\n2:25:23.060 --> 2:25:28.420\n But the probability of doing that is very, very small because tiny little paths next\n\n2:25:28.420 --> 2:25:32.500\n door to any given path cancel out that path.\n\n2:25:32.500 --> 2:25:38.940\n And the ones that all add together, they're the ones that are more likely to be followed.\n\n2:25:38.940 --> 2:25:45.740\n And this actually ties in with Fermat's principle of least action and there are ideas in optics\n\n2:25:45.740 --> 2:25:50.620\n that go into this as well and just sort of beautifully brings everything together.\n\n2:25:50.620 --> 2:25:54.060\n But the particle sniffs out all possible paths.\n\n2:25:54.060 --> 2:25:55.060\n What a crazy idea.\n\n2:25:55.060 --> 2:26:00.980\n But if you do the mathematics associated with that, it ends up being actually useful, a\n\n2:26:00.980 --> 2:26:02.540\n useful way of looking at the world.\n\n2:26:02.540 --> 2:26:07.780\n So you're also, I mean, you're widely acknowledged as, I mean, outside of your science work as\n\n2:26:07.780 --> 2:26:12.500\n being one of the greatest educators in the world.\n\n2:26:12.500 --> 2:26:16.140\n And Feynman is famous for being that.\n\n2:26:16.140 --> 2:26:19.220\n Is there something about being a teacher that you...\n\n2:26:19.220 --> 2:26:23.260\n Well, it's very, very rewarding when you have students who are really into it.\n\n2:26:23.260 --> 2:26:29.220\n You know, going back to Feynman, at Caltech, I was taking these graduate courses and there\n\n2:26:29.220 --> 2:26:34.140\n were two of us, myself and Jeff Richmond, who's now a professor of physics at University\n\n2:26:34.140 --> 2:26:38.100\n of California, Santa Barbara, who asked lots of questions.\n\n2:26:38.100 --> 2:26:42.780\n And a lot of the Caltech students are nervous about asking questions.\n\n2:26:42.780 --> 2:26:43.980\n They want to save face.\n\n2:26:43.980 --> 2:26:49.100\n They seem to think that if they ask a question, their peers might think it's a stupid question.\n\n2:26:49.100 --> 2:26:52.620\n Well, I didn't really care what people thought and Jeff Richmond didn't either.\n\n2:26:52.620 --> 2:26:57.300\n We asked all these questions and in fact, in many cases, they were quite good questions\n\n2:26:57.300 --> 2:27:00.660\n and Feynman said, well, the rest of you should be having questions like this.\n\n2:27:00.660 --> 2:27:07.260\n And I remember one time in particular when he said to the rest of the class, why is it\n\n2:27:07.260 --> 2:27:09.620\n always these two?\n\n2:27:09.620 --> 2:27:12.020\n Aren't the rest of you curious about what I'm saying?\n\n2:27:12.020 --> 2:27:14.580\n Do you really understand it all that well?\n\n2:27:14.580 --> 2:27:17.980\n If so, why aren't you asking the next most logical question?\n\n2:27:17.980 --> 2:27:23.300\n No, you guys are too scared to ask these questions that these two are asking.\n\n2:27:23.300 --> 2:27:28.420\n So he actually invited us to lunch a couple of times where just the three of us sat and\n\n2:27:28.420 --> 2:27:33.540\n had lunch with one of the greatest thinkers of 20th century physics.\n\n2:27:33.540 --> 2:27:38.220\n And so, yeah, he rubbed off on me and, you know, you encourage questions as well, encourage\n\n2:27:38.220 --> 2:27:45.140\n questions, you know, and yeah, you know, definitely, I mean, you know, I encourage questions.\n\n2:27:45.140 --> 2:27:46.980\n I like it when students ask questions.\n\n2:27:46.980 --> 2:27:51.340\n I tell them that they shouldn't feel shy about asking a question.\n\n2:27:51.340 --> 2:27:55.580\n Probably half the students in the class would have that same question if they even understood\n\n2:27:55.580 --> 2:27:58.460\n the material enough to ask that question.\n\n2:27:58.460 --> 2:27:59.460\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:59.460 --> 2:28:04.580\n Curiosity is the first step of seeing the beauty of something.\n\n2:28:04.580 --> 2:28:10.180\n So yeah, and the question is the ultimate form of curiosity.\n\n2:28:10.180 --> 2:28:14.220\n Let me ask, what is the meaning of life?\n\n2:28:14.220 --> 2:28:19.900\n The meaning of life, you know, from a cosmologist's perspective or from a human perspective, personal,\n\n2:28:19.900 --> 2:28:23.300\n you know, life is what you make of it, really, right?\n\n2:28:23.300 --> 2:28:31.100\n It's each of us has to have our own meaning and it doesn't have to be.\n\n2:28:31.100 --> 2:28:36.220\n Well, I think that in many cases, meaning is to some degree associated with goals.\n\n2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:41.380\n You set some goals or expectations for yourself, things you want to accomplish, things you\n\n2:28:41.380 --> 2:28:47.100\n want to do, things you want to experience, and to the degree that you experience those\n\n2:28:47.100 --> 2:28:50.740\n and do those things, it can give you meaning.\n\n2:28:50.740 --> 2:28:56.540\n You don't have to change the world the way Newton or Michelangelo or da Vinci did.\n\n2:28:56.540 --> 2:29:00.180\n I mean, people often say, you changed the world, but look, come on, there's seven and\n\n2:29:00.180 --> 2:29:02.780\n a half, close to eight billion of us now.\n\n2:29:02.780 --> 2:29:06.300\n Most of us are not going to change the world and does that mean that most of us are leading\n\n2:29:06.300 --> 2:29:07.900\n meaningful lives?\n\n2:29:07.900 --> 2:29:15.220\n No, it just has to be something that gives you meaning, that gives you satisfaction,\n\n2:29:15.220 --> 2:29:17.860\n that gives you a good feeling about what you did.\n\n2:29:17.860 --> 2:29:24.480\n And often, based on human nature, which can be very good and also very bad, but often\n\n2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:31.800\n it's the things that help others that give us meaning and a feeling of satisfaction.\n\n2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:37.100\n You taught someone to read, you cared for someone who was terminally ill, you brought\n\n2:29:37.100 --> 2:29:43.220\n up a nice family, you brought up your kids, you did a good job, you put your heart and\n\n2:29:43.220 --> 2:29:49.780\n soul into it, you read a lot of books if that's what you wanted to do, had a lot of perspectives\n\n2:29:49.780 --> 2:29:54.840\n on life, you traveled the world if that's what you wanted to do.\n\n2:29:54.840 --> 2:30:00.260\n But if some of these things are not within reach, you're in a socioeconomic position\n\n2:30:00.260 --> 2:30:06.500\n where you can't travel the world or whatever, you find other forms of meaning.\n\n2:30:06.500 --> 2:30:13.660\n It doesn't have to be some profound, I'm going to change the world, I'm going to be\n\n2:30:13.660 --> 2:30:17.900\n the one who everyone remembers type thing, right?\n\n2:30:17.900 --> 2:30:26.100\n In the context of the greatest story ever told, like the fact that we came from stars\n\n2:30:26.100 --> 2:30:31.500\n and now we're two apes asking about the meaning of life, how does that fit together?\n\n2:30:31.500 --> 2:30:34.780\n How does that make any sense?\n\n2:30:34.780 --> 2:30:39.700\n It does, it does, and this is sort of what I was referring to, that it's a beautiful\n\n2:30:39.700 --> 2:30:46.820\n universe that allows us to come into creation, right?\n\n2:30:46.820 --> 2:30:52.780\n It's a way that the universe found of knowing, of understanding itself, because I don't\n\n2:30:52.780 --> 2:31:00.420\n think that inanimate rocks and stars and black holes and things have any real capability\n\n2:31:00.420 --> 2:31:08.260\n of abstract thoughts and of learning about the rest of the universe or even their origins.\n\n2:31:08.260 --> 2:31:16.060\n I mean, they're just a pile of atoms that has no conscience, has no ability to think,\n\n2:31:16.060 --> 2:31:20.620\n has no ability to explore, and we do.\n\n2:31:20.620 --> 2:31:27.940\n And I'm not saying we're the epitome of all life forever, but at least for life on Earth\n\n2:31:27.940 --> 2:31:36.060\n so far the evidence suggests that we are the epitome in terms of the richness of our thoughts,\n\n2:31:36.060 --> 2:31:42.180\n the degree to which we can explore the universe, do experiments, build machines, understand\n\n2:31:42.180 --> 2:31:43.180\n our origins.\n\n2:31:43.180 --> 2:31:50.300\n And I just hope that we use science for good, not evil, and that we don't end up destroying\n\n2:31:50.300 --> 2:31:51.300\n ourselves.\n\n2:31:51.300 --> 2:31:54.320\n I mean, the whales and dolphins are plenty intelligent.\n\n2:31:54.320 --> 2:31:59.180\n They don't ask abstract questions, they don't read books, but on the other hand, they're\n\n2:31:59.180 --> 2:32:03.360\n not in any danger of destroying themselves and everything else as well.\n\n2:32:03.360 --> 2:32:10.100\n And so maybe that's a better form of intelligence, but at least in terms of our ability to explore\n\n2:32:10.100 --> 2:32:16.300\n and make use of our minds, I mean, to me, it's this.\n\n2:32:16.300 --> 2:32:21.740\n It's this that gives me the potential for meaning, right?\n\n2:32:21.740 --> 2:32:24.520\n The fact that I can understand and explore.\n\n2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:31.560\n It's kind of fascinating to think that the universe created us and eventually we've built\n\n2:32:31.560 --> 2:32:38.500\n telescopes to look back at it, to look back at its origins and to wonder how the heck\n\n2:32:38.500 --> 2:32:39.500\n the thing works.\n\n2:32:39.500 --> 2:32:40.500\n It's magnificent.\n\n2:32:40.500 --> 2:32:44.260\n It needn't have been that way, right?\n\n2:32:44.260 --> 2:32:48.480\n And this is one of the, you know, the multiverse sort of things.\n\n2:32:48.480 --> 2:32:53.460\n You know, you can alter the laws of physics or even the constants of nature, seemingly\n\n2:32:53.460 --> 2:32:58.020\n inconsequential things like the mass ratio of the proton and the neutron, you know, wake\n\n2:32:58.020 --> 2:32:59.720\n me up when it's over, right?\n\n2:32:59.720 --> 2:33:00.720\n What could be more boring?\n\n2:33:00.720 --> 2:33:04.900\n But it turns out you play with things a little bit like the ratio of the mass of the neutron\n\n2:33:04.900 --> 2:33:11.700\n to the proton and you generally get boring universes, only hydrogen or only helium or\n\n2:33:11.700 --> 2:33:12.700\n only iron.\n\n2:33:12.700 --> 2:33:19.020\n You can't even get the rich periodic table, let alone bacteria, paramecia, slugs and humans,\n\n2:33:19.020 --> 2:33:20.020\n okay?\n\n2:33:20.020 --> 2:33:25.440\n I'm not even anthropocentrizing this to the degree that I could.\n\n2:33:25.440 --> 2:33:33.060\n Even a rich periodic table wouldn't be possible if certain constants weren't this way, but\n\n2:33:33.060 --> 2:33:34.060\n they are.\n\n2:33:34.060 --> 2:33:39.420\n And that to me leads to the idea of a multiverse that, you know, the dice were thrown many,\n\n2:33:39.420 --> 2:33:44.020\n many times and there's this cosmic archipelago where most of the universes are boring and\n\n2:33:44.020 --> 2:33:45.700\n some might be more interesting.\n\n2:33:45.700 --> 2:33:51.700\n But we are in the rare breed that's really quite darn interesting.\n\n2:33:51.700 --> 2:33:57.060\n And if there were only one and maybe there is only one, well then that's truly amazing.\n\n2:33:57.060 --> 2:33:58.060\n We're lucky.\n\n2:33:58.060 --> 2:33:59.060\n We're lucky.\n\n2:33:59.060 --> 2:34:03.020\n But I actually think there are lots and lots, just like there are lots of planets.\n\n2:34:03.020 --> 2:34:05.860\n Earth isn't special for any particular reason.\n\n2:34:05.860 --> 2:34:09.820\n There are lots of planets in our solar system and especially around other stars.\n\n2:34:09.820 --> 2:34:14.660\n And occasionally there are going to be ones that are conducive to the development of complexity\n\n2:34:14.660 --> 2:34:17.100\n culminating in life as we know it.\n\n2:34:17.100 --> 2:34:18.820\n And that's a beautiful story.\n\n2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:21.660\n I don't think there's a better way to end it.\n\n2:34:21.660 --> 2:34:23.100\n Alex, it's a huge honor.\n\n2:34:23.100 --> 2:34:25.300\n One of my favorite conversations I've had in this podcast.\n\n2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:27.580\n Well, thank

pies, were made in the interiors of collapsing stars.\n\n2:35:32.340 --> 2:35:36.060\n We are made of star stuff.\n\n2:35:36.060 --> 2:35:57.380\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
