00:08.900\n on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.\n\n00:08.900 --> 00:11.460\n Joe has been a inspiration to me\n\n00:11.460 --> 00:13.560\n and I thank to millions of people\n\n00:13.560 --> 00:17.660\n for just being somebody who puts love out there in the world\n\n00:17.660 --> 00:20.920\n and being genuinely curious about wild ideas\n\n00:20.920 --> 00:24.780\n from chimps and psychedelics to quantum mechanics\n\n00:24.780 --> 00:26.800\n and artificial intelligence.\n\n00:26.800 --> 00:29.620\n Like many of you, I've been a fan of his podcast\n\n00:29.620 --> 00:34.620\n for over a decade and now, somehow, miraculously,\n\n00:34.680 --> 00:38.400\n am humbled to be able to call him a friend.\n\n00:38.400 --> 00:40.780\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on

to get a discount\n\n01:05.640 --> 01:08.400\n and to support this podcast.\n\n01:08.400 --> 01:11.220\n I usually do full ad reads here and never ads in the middle\n\n01:11.220 --> 01:14.100\n but this time, I'll just go straight to the conversation\n\n01:14.100 --> 01:16.220\n with a bit of guitar first.\n\n01:16.220 --> 01:36.220\n [\"The Unlimited Breadsticks and Dollar Shave Club\"]\n\n01:54.160 --> 01:56.160\n Do you ponder your mortality?\n\n01:56.160 --> 01:57.900\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n01:57.900 --> 01:59.520\n I do think about it sometimes.\n\n01:59.520 --> 02:01.820\n I mean, it does pop into my head sometimes,\n\n02:01.820 --> 02:04.980\n just the fact that, I mean, I'm 53,\n\n02:04.980 --> 02:09.660\n so if everything goes great, I have less than 50 years left.\n\n02:10.760 --> 02:13.960\n If everything goes great, like no car accidents,\n\n02:13.960 --> 02:15.620\n no injuries.\n\n02:15.620 --> 02:16.880\n But it could happen today.\n\n02:16.880 --> 02:18.280\n This could be your last day.\n\n02:18.280 --> 02:19.160\n Could be.\n\n02:19.160 --> 02:22.320\n That's kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death.\n\n02:22.320 --> 02:24.040\n There's a bunch of philosophers,\n\n02:24.040 --> 02:27.480\n Ernest Becker and Sheldon Solomon,\n\n02:27.480 --> 02:31.520\n they believe that death is at the core of everything.\n\n02:31.520 --> 02:33.340\n Wrote this book, Warm at the Core.\n\n02:33.340 --> 02:36.300\n So does that come into play in the way you see the world?\n\n02:37.520 --> 02:41.540\n I think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial\n\n02:41.540 --> 02:43.560\n and understanding that your time is limited\n\n02:43.560 --> 02:44.960\n can aid you greatly.\n\n02:44.960 --> 02:48.320\n I think knowing that this is a temporary time,\n\n02:48.320 --> 02:51.480\n that we have finite lifespans,\n\n02:51.480 --> 02:55.600\n I think there's great power in that\n\n02:55.600 --> 02:58.640\n because it motivates you, it gets you going.\n\n02:58.640 --> 03:01.200\n I think being an immortal, living forever\n\n03:01.200 --> 03:02.780\n would be one of the most depressing things,\n\n03:02.780 --> 03:05.160\n particularly if everybody else was dying around you.\n\n03:05.160 --> 03:08.200\n And I think one of the things that makes life\n\n03:08.200 --> 03:12.360\n so interesting and fascinating is that it doesn't last.\n\n03:12.360 --> 03:15.480\n You know, that you really get a brief amount of time here\n\n03:15.480 --> 03:17.240\n and really by the time you're just starting\n\n03:17.240 --> 03:19.960\n to kind of figure yourself out, who you are\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:22.400\n and how not to screw things up so bad,\n\n03:22.400 --> 03:23.520\n like, time's up.\n\n03:23.520 --> 03:24.680\n The ride's over.\n\n03:24.680 --> 03:26.240\n What about from your, like,\n\n03:26.240 --> 03:27.840\n from your daughter's perspective?\n\n03:28.960 --> 03:31.960\n Do you think about the world we're in now\n\n03:31.960 --> 03:34.320\n and what kind of world you're gonna leave them?\n\n03:35.280 --> 03:36.120\n I do.\n\n03:36.120 --> 03:36.960\n And do you worry about it?\n\n03:36.960 --> 03:38.600\n I do, yeah, I do.\n\n03:38.600 --> 03:42.760\n I do when I see these protests and riots and chaos\n\n03:42.760 --> 03:47.760\n and so much, so much anger in the world today.\n\n03:48.440 --> 03:49.680\n And then particularly today,\n\n03:49.680 --> 03:52.280\n I think because of the pandemic\n\n03:52.280 --> 03:55.080\n and the fact that so many folks are out of work\n\n03:55.080 --> 03:57.200\n and through no fault of their own\n\n03:57.200 --> 03:59.320\n and can't make ends meet\n\n03:59.320 --> 04:02.720\n and these people feel so helpless and angry,\n\n04:02.720 --> 04:06.780\n it's a particularly divisive time.\n\n04:06.780 --> 04:10.400\n It's a particularly turmoil filled time.\n\n04:10.400 --> 04:14.800\n And it just doesn't seem like the world of a year ago even.\n\n04:14.800 --> 04:17.640\n It feels very chaotic and dangerous.\n\n04:17.640 --> 04:19.200\n And it's a small thing,\n\n04:19.200 --> 04:22.080\n like in terms of the possibilities of things\n\n04:22.080 --> 04:23.160\n that could happen to the world,\n\n04:23.160 --> 04:25.440\n like a pandemic like the one we've experienced,\n\n04:25.440 --> 04:27.640\n it really just doubles the amount of deaths\n\n04:27.640 --> 04:29.040\n on a bad flu year.\n\n04:29.040 --> 04:31.960\n So it's relatively speaking is a small thing\n\n04:31.960 --> 04:36.200\n in comparison to super volcano eruptions,\n\n04:36.200 --> 04:40.520\n asteroid impact, a real horrific pandemic\n\n04:40.520 --> 04:44.080\n or one that really wipes out millions\n\n04:44.080 --> 04:45.980\n and millions of people.\n\n04:45.980 --> 04:50.400\n It's stunning how fragile civility is.\n\n04:50.400 --> 04:55.080\n It's stunning how fragile our society really is\n\n04:55.080 --> 04:57.040\n that something like this can come along,\n\n04:57.040 --> 04:58.560\n some unprecedented thing,\n\n04:58.560 --> 05:00.120\n unprecedented thing can come along\n\n05:00.120 --> 05:02.320\n and all of a sudden everybody's out of work for six months\n\n05:02.320 --> 05:04.040\n and then everybody's at each other's throats.\n\n05:04.040 --> 05:06.240\n And then politically everyone's at each other's throats.\n\n05:06.240 --> 05:09.280\n And then with the advent of social media\n\n05:09.280 --> 05:13.440\n and the images that you can see with the videos\n\n05:13.440 --> 05:17.380\n of police abuse and just racial tensions\n\n05:17.380 --> 05:19.720\n are at an all time high to a point where like,\n\n05:19.720 --> 05:23.120\n if you asked me just five or six years ago,\n\n05:23.120 --> 05:27.200\n like have racial problems in this country\n\n05:27.200 --> 05:28.680\n largely been alleviated,\n\n05:28.680 --> 05:29.520\n I'd probably say, yeah,\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:31.320\n it's way better than it's ever been before.\n\n05:31.320 --> 05:32.840\n But now you could argue that it's not.\n\n05:32.840 --> 05:34.520\n Now you could argue it's no, it's way worse\n\n05:34.520 --> 05:36.600\n in just a small amount of time.\n\n05:36.600 --> 05:39.760\n It's way worse than it's ever been during my lifetime\n\n05:39.760 --> 05:41.680\n while I'm aware of it.\n\n05:41.680 --> 05:44.500\n Obviously when I was a young boy in the 60s,\n\n05:44.500 --> 05:46.960\n they were still going through the civil rights movement,\n\n05:46.960 --> 05:51.640\n but now it just seems very fever pitched.\n\n05:51.640 --> 05:53.760\n And I think a lot of that is because of the pandemic\n\n05:53.760 --> 05:58.640\n and is because of all the heightened just tension.\n\n05:58.640 --> 06:03.640\n What I liken it to is road rage.\n\n06:03.720 --> 06:05.440\n Cause you know, people have road rage,\n\n06:05.440 --> 06:06.840\n not just because they're in the car\n\n06:06.840 --> 06:08.120\n and no one can get to them,\n\n06:08.120 --> 06:10.540\n but also because you're at a heightened state\n\n06:10.540 --> 06:12.000\n because you're driving fast\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:13.120\n and you know you're driving fast.\n\n06:13.120 --> 06:14.960\n You know, you have to make split second movements.\n\n06:14.960 --> 06:16.600\n And so anybody doing something, you're like,\n\n06:16.600 --> 06:18.800\n what the people go crazy\n\n06:18.800 --> 06:21.160\n because they're already at an eight\n\n06:21.160 --> 06:23.540\n because they're in the car and they're moving very quickly.\n\n06:23.540 --> 06:26.120\n That's what it feels like with today with the pandemic\n\n06:26.120 --> 06:28.720\n feels like everybody is already at an eight.\n\n06:28.720 --> 06:30.240\n So anything that comes along,\n\n06:30.240 --> 06:33.160\n it's like light it all on fire, you know, burn it down.\n\n06:33.160 --> 06:36.760\n Like that's part of what I think is part of the reason\n\n06:36.760 --> 06:39.720\n for a lot of the looting and the riots and all the chaos.\n\n06:39.720 --> 06:41.160\n It's not just the people that are at work,\n\n06:41.160 --> 06:45.840\n but it's also that everyone feels so tense already\n\n06:45.840 --> 06:47.960\n and everyone feels so helpless.\n\n06:47.960 --> 06:51.440\n And it's like, you know, doing something like that\n\n06:51.440 --> 06:56.440\n makes people, it just, it gives people\n\n06:57.600 --> 07:01.120\n a whole new motivation for chaos,\n\n07:01.120 --> 07:05.200\n a whole new motivation for doing destructive things\n\n07:05.200 --> 07:07.400\n that I've never experienced in my life.\n\n07:07.400 --> 07:10.700\n And your better days when you see a positive future,\n\n07:10.700 --> 07:15.280\n what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020?\n\n07:15.280 --> 07:18.120\n Like if you visualize a 2025,\n\n07:18.120 --> 07:19.720\n that's a better world than today.\n\n07:19.720 --> 07:20.600\n What is that?\n\n07:20.600 --> 07:22.360\n How do we get there and what does that look like?\n\n07:22.360 --> 07:23.460\n It's a good question.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.320\n I can honestly say I don't know.\n\n07:29.320 --> 07:32.640\n And I wouldn't have said I don't know a year ago.\n\n07:32.640 --> 07:34.840\n A year ago, I would have said, we're gonna be okay.\n\n07:34.840 --> 07:38.000\n As much as people hate Trump, the economy is doing great.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.360\n I think we're gonna be fine.\n\n07:39.360 --> 07:41.220\n That's not how I feel today.\n\n07:41.220 --> 07:45.720\n Today, I don't think there's a clear solution politically\n\n07:45.720 --> 07:47.240\n because I think if Trump wins,\n\n07:47.240 --> 07:48.540\n people are gonna be furious.\n\n07:48.540 --> 07:51.400\n And I think if Biden wins, people are gonna be furious.\n\n07:52.240 --> 07:55.800\n Particularly like if things get more woke,\n\n07:55.800 --> 08:00.800\n if people continue to enforce this force compliance\n\n08:01.140 --> 08:04.440\n and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way,\n\n08:04.440 --> 08:07.820\n which seems to be a part of what this whole woke thing is.\n\n08:07.820 --> 08:10.920\n The most disturbing for me is that I see what's going on.\n\n08:10.920 --> 08:14.900\n I see there's a lot of losers that have hopped on this\n\n08:14.900 --> 08:17.040\n and they shove it in people's faces\n\n08:17.040 --> 08:18.140\n and it doesn't have to make sense.\n\n08:18.140 --> 08:20.320\n Like there was a Black Lives Matter protest\n\n08:20.320 --> 08:23.360\n that stopped this woman at a restaurant.\n\n08:23.360 --> 08:25.240\n They were surrounding her outside a restaurant.\n\n08:25.240 --> 08:28.480\n They were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance.\n\n08:28.480 --> 08:31.800\n This is a woman who's marched for Black Lives multiple times,\n\n08:31.800 --> 08:33.160\n Black Lives Matter multiple times.\n\n08:33.160 --> 08:36.360\n And the people all around her doing this were all white.\n\n08:36.360 --> 08:37.180\n It's all weird.\n\n08:37.180 --> 08:39.160\n My friend, Coach T, he's a wrestling coach,\n\n08:39.160 --> 08:42.480\n is also on a podcast, my friend, Brian Moses.\n\n08:42.480 --> 08:45.120\n His take on it is that black, and he's a black guy.\n\n08:45.120 --> 08:47.200\n He says, Black Lives Matter is a white cult.\n\n08:47.200 --> 08:49.920\n And I'm like, when you see that picture,\n\n08:49.920 --> 08:52.280\n it's hard to argue that he's got a point.\n\n08:52.280 --> 08:54.240\n I mean, it's clearly not all about that,\n\n08:54.240 --> 08:57.580\n but there's a lot of people that have jumped on board\n\n08:57.580 --> 09:00.760\n that are very much like cult members.\n\n09:00.760 --> 09:04.600\n Because the thing about Black Lives Matter or any movement\n\n09:04.600 --> 09:06.760\n is you can't control who joins.\n\n09:07.760 --> 09:10.520\n There's no entrance examination.\n\n09:10.520 --> 09:12.400\n So you don't go, okay, how do you feel about this?\n\n09:12.400 --> 09:13.680\n What's your perceptions on that?\n\n09:13.680 --> 09:18.520\n Like the man who shot the Trump supporter in Portland,\n\n09:18.520 --> 09:20.240\n that guy who murdered the Trump supporter\n\n09:20.240 --> 09:21.580\n then the cops shot him.\n\n09:21.580 --> 09:25.760\n That guy was walking around with his hand on his gun\n\n09:25.760 --> 09:27.520\n looking for Trump supporters.\n\n09:27.520 --> 09:31.480\n Just want, I mean, he's a known violent guy\n\n09:31.480 --> 09:33.480\n who was walking around looking for Trump supporters,\n\n09:33.480 --> 09:34.780\n found one and shot one.\n\n09:34.780 --> 09:36.880\n That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter.\n\n09:36.880 --> 09:38.840\n He's a white guy, he shot another white guy.\n\n09:38.840 --> 09:40.640\n It's just madness.\n\n09:40.640 --> 09:43.960\n And that kind of madness is,\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:47.440\n it's disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly.\n\n09:47.440 --> 09:51.360\n I mean, there's been riots in Portland every night.\n\n09:51.360 --> 09:55.040\n Oh, excuse me, demonstrations for 101 days now.\n\n09:55.040 --> 09:57.800\n 101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire,\n\n09:57.800 --> 09:59.860\n breaking into federal buildings.\n\n09:59.860 --> 10:02.500\n It's like, whoever saw that coming?\n\n10:02.500 --> 10:03.440\n Nobody saw that coming.\n\n10:03.440 --> 10:07.340\n So I don't know what the solution is\n\n10:07.340 --> 10:09.400\n and I don't know what it looks like in five years.\n\n10:09.400 --> 10:11.240\n But 2025, to answer your question,\n\n10:11.240 --> 10:12.880\n like it could be anything.\n\n10:12.880 --> 10:14.760\n I mean, we could be looking at Mad Max.\n\n10:14.760 --> 10:16.720\n We could be looking at the apocalypse.\n\n10:16.720 --> 10:20.480\n We could also be looking at an invasion from another country.\n\n10:20.480 --> 10:23.640\n We could be looking at a war, like a real hot war.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.280\n To put a little bit of responsibility on you,\n\n10:27.280 --> 10:28.840\n like for me, I've listened to you\n\n10:28.840 --> 10:31.560\n since the Red Band, Olive Garden days,\n\n10:31.560 --> 10:33.280\n that's the very beginning.\n\n10:33.280 --> 10:36.080\n And there was something in the way you communicated\n\n10:36.080 --> 10:37.600\n about the world, maybe there was others,\n\n10:37.600 --> 10:39.560\n but you're the one I was aware of,\n\n10:39.560 --> 10:44.160\n is you're open minded and like loving towards the world,\n\n10:44.160 --> 10:45.760\n especially as the podcast developed.\n\n10:45.760 --> 10:49.680\n Like you just demonstrated and lived\n\n10:49.680 --> 10:51.680\n this kind of just kindness,\n\n10:51.680 --> 10:53.760\n or maybe even like lack of jealousy\n\n10:53.760 --> 10:55.880\n in your own little profession of comedy.\n\n10:55.880 --> 11:00.080\n It was clear that you didn't succumb\n\n11:00.080 --> 11:02.080\n to the weaker aspects of human nature\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:04.320\n and thereby inspire like people like me,\n\n11:04.320 --> 11:09.240\n who I was naturally, probably especially in like the 20s,\n\n11:09.240 --> 11:12.520\n early 20s, kind of jealous on the success of others.\n\n11:12.520 --> 11:15.800\n And you're really the primary person that taught me\n\n11:15.800 --> 11:19.920\n to truly celebrate the success of others.\n\n11:19.920 --> 11:24.920\n And so by way of question, you kind of have a role in this\n\n11:25.080 --> 11:26.680\n of making a better 2025.\n\n11:26.680 --> 11:27.840\n You have such a big megaphone.\n\n11:27.840 --> 11:31.840\n Is there something you think you can do on this podcast\n\n11:31.840 --> 11:35.000\n with the words, the way you talk,\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.560\n the things you discuss that could create a better 2025?\n\n11:39.560 --> 11:44.480\n I think if anything, I could help in leading by example,\n\n11:44.480 --> 11:49.200\n but that's only gonna help the people that are listening.\n\n11:50.080 --> 11:52.360\n I don't know what else I can do\n\n11:52.360 --> 11:54.200\n in terms of like make the world a better place,\n\n11:54.200 --> 11:59.200\n other than express my hopes and wishes for that\n\n11:59.200 --> 12:02.520\n and just try to be as nice as I can to people\n\n12:02.520 --> 12:04.240\n as often as I can.\n\n12:04.240 --> 12:07.080\n But I also think that I've fallen into this weird category,\n\n12:07.080 --> 12:09.760\n particularly with the Spotify deal,\n\n12:09.760 --> 12:12.960\n where I'm one of them now.\n\n12:12.960 --> 12:15.000\n I'm not a regular person anymore.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:18.640\n Now I'm like some famous rich guy.\n\n12:18.640 --> 12:20.320\n So you go from being a regular person\n\n12:20.320 --> 12:23.040\n to a famous rich guy that's out of touch.\n\n12:23.040 --> 12:26.920\n And that's a real issue whenever you're talking\n\n12:26.920 --> 12:30.960\n about the economy, about just real life problems.\n\n12:30.960 --> 12:32.040\n It's interesting.\n\n12:32.040 --> 12:33.800\n It kind of hurts my heart to hear people say\n\n12:33.800 --> 12:36.480\n about Elon Musk, he's just a billionaire.\n\n12:36.480 --> 12:38.480\n It's an interesting statement.\n\n12:38.480 --> 12:41.160\n But I think if you just continue being you\n\n12:41.160 --> 12:42.960\n and he continue being him,\n\n12:45.400 --> 12:48.040\n I think people are just voicing their worry\n\n12:48.040 --> 12:49.640\n that you become some rich guy.\n\n12:49.640 --> 12:51.680\n I don't even know if they're doing that.\n\n12:51.680 --> 12:53.760\n I think they're just finding,\n\n12:53.760 --> 12:55.880\n the way he describes it, an attack vector.\n\n12:55.880 --> 12:58.280\n Yeah, and I think he's right.\n\n12:58.280 --> 13:01.640\n I think they can dismiss you by just saying,\n\n13:01.640 --> 13:03.920\n oh, you're just a that.\n\n13:03.920 --> 13:08.840\n You're easily definable.\n\n13:08.840 --> 13:11.080\n Right, but there's truth to that.\n\n13:11.080 --> 13:14.040\n If you're not careful, you can become out of touch.\n\n13:14.040 --> 13:17.280\n But that's an interesting thing.\n\n13:17.280 --> 13:19.440\n Why haven't you become out of touch?\n\n13:19.440 --> 13:24.040\n As a human off the podcast, you don't act like a,\n\n13:24.040 --> 13:26.560\n like you talk to somebody like me.\n\n13:26.560 --> 13:28.800\n You don't talk like a famous person\n\n13:28.800 --> 13:33.680\n or you don't act rich, like you're better than others.\n\n13:33.680 --> 13:37.280\n There's a certain, listen, I've talked to quite a few,\n\n13:37.280 --> 13:40.240\n you have too, but I've talked to a special kind of group\n\n13:40.240 --> 13:42.960\n of people that are like Nobel Prize winners, let's say.\n\n13:42.960 --> 13:47.480\n They sometimes have an air to them that's of arrogance.\n\n13:47.480 --> 13:49.360\n And you don't, what's that about?\n\n13:49.360 --> 13:51.840\n Well, you gotta know what that is, right?\n\n13:51.840 --> 13:55.320\n Like that air of arrogance comes from\n\n13:55.320 --> 13:57.640\n drinking your own Koolaid.\n\n13:57.640 --> 14:00.280\n You start believing that somehow or another,\n\n14:00.280 --> 14:02.040\n just because you're getting praise from all these people,\n\n14:02.040 --> 14:04.520\n that you really are something different.\n\n14:04.520 --> 14:08.760\n Usually it exemplifies, there's something there\n\n14:08.760 --> 14:10.480\n where there's a lack of struggle.\n\n14:11.600 --> 14:14.800\n And I think a struggle is\n\n14:14.800 --> 14:19.800\n probably one of the most important balancing tools\n\n14:22.320 --> 14:24.000\n that a person can have.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:29.000\n And for me, I struggle mentally and I struggle physically.\n\n14:29.280 --> 14:31.920\n I struggle mentally in that, like we were talking about\n\n14:31.920 --> 14:34.320\n on the podcast we did previously,\n\n14:34.320 --> 14:37.800\n you and I on my podcast said, I'm not a fan of my work.\n\n14:37.800 --> 14:38.920\n I'm not a fan of what I do.\n\n14:38.920 --> 14:41.000\n I'm my harshest critic.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.480\n So anytime anybody says something bad about me,\n\n14:43.480 --> 14:46.960\n I'm like, listen, I said way worse about myself.\n\n14:46.960 --> 14:50.040\n I don't like anything I do.\n\n14:50.040 --> 14:53.040\n I'm ruthlessly introspective.\n\n14:53.040 --> 14:54.880\n And I will continue to be that way.\n\n14:54.880 --> 14:57.080\n Cause that's the only way you could be good as a comedian.\n\n14:57.080 --> 14:57.920\n There's no other way.\n\n14:57.920 --> 14:59.920\n You can't just think you're awesome and just go out there.\n\n14:59.920 --> 15:03.040\n You have to be like picking apart everything you do.\n\n15:03.040 --> 15:04.240\n But there's a balance to that too,\n\n15:04.240 --> 15:05.440\n cause you have to have enough confidence\n\n15:05.440 --> 15:06.800\n to go out there and perform.\n\n15:06.800 --> 15:08.280\n You can't think, oh my God, I suck.\n\n15:08.280 --> 15:10.320\n I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing\n\n15:10.320 --> 15:11.600\n because I put in all that work.\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:13.360\n And one of the reasons why I put in all that work\n\n15:13.360 --> 15:17.520\n is I don't like the end result most of the time.\n\n15:17.520 --> 15:19.640\n So I need to work at it all the time.\n\n15:19.640 --> 15:21.320\n And then there's physical struggle,\n\n15:21.320 --> 15:23.960\n which I think balances everything out.\n\n15:23.960 --> 15:27.680\n Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy\n\n15:27.680 --> 15:30.720\n that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery,\n\n15:30.720 --> 15:33.240\n where if you have extra charge,\n\n15:33.240 --> 15:35.000\n it's like it leaks out of the top\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.600\n and it becomes unmanageable and messy.\n\n15:37.600 --> 15:39.240\n And that's how my psyche is.\n\n15:39.240 --> 15:41.560\n If I have too much energy,\n\n15:41.560 --> 15:46.440\n if I'm not exerting myself in a violent way,\n\n15:46.440 --> 15:49.960\n like an explosive way, like wearing myself out,\n\n15:49.960 --> 15:52.760\n I just don't like the way the world is.\n\n15:52.760 --> 15:54.640\n I don't like the way I interface with the world.\n\n15:54.640 --> 15:56.000\n I'm too tense.\n\n15:56.000 --> 16:00.440\n I'm too quick to be upset about things.\n\n16:00.440 --> 16:03.040\n But when I work out hard\n\n16:03.040 --> 16:07.160\n and I put in a brutal training session, everything's fine.\n\n16:07.160 --> 16:12.160\n Well, the first time I talked to you, Jerry, you were doing\n\n16:13.800 --> 16:15.800\n Sober October.\n\n16:15.800 --> 16:17.680\n And there's something in your eyes,\n\n16:18.640 --> 16:19.960\n like I think you've talked about\n\n16:19.960 --> 16:22.920\n that you exercise the demons out essentially.\n\n16:22.920 --> 16:26.000\n So you exercise to get whatever the parts of you\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.840\n that you don't like out.\n\n16:27.840 --> 16:30.680\n There's a darkness in you there,\n\n16:30.680 --> 16:34.640\n like the competitiveness and the focus of that person.\n\n16:34.640 --> 16:36.440\n That was a scary time in a lot of ways,\n\n16:36.440 --> 16:38.040\n that Sober October thing.\n\n16:38.040 --> 16:41.440\n Because my friends, we were all talking shit, right?\n\n16:41.440 --> 16:43.360\n Because we're competing against each other\n\n16:43.360 --> 16:44.600\n in these fitness challenges.\n\n16:44.600 --> 16:48.480\n And you had one point,\n\n16:48.480 --> 16:50.280\n like you got a certain amount of points\n\n16:50.280 --> 16:54.520\n for each minute that you went at 80% of your max heart rate.\n\n16:54.520 --> 16:57.520\n And one day I got 1100 points.\n\n16:57.520 --> 17:00.520\n So I did seven hours on an elliptical machine\n\n17:00.520 --> 17:03.600\n watching the bathhouse scene from John Wick\n\n17:03.600 --> 17:05.040\n where he murders all those people in the bathhouse.\n\n17:05.040 --> 17:07.160\n I watched it probably 50 times in a row.\n\n17:07.160 --> 17:08.400\n I went crazy.\n\n17:08.400 --> 17:11.280\n I went crazy, but I went crazy in a weird way\n\n17:11.280 --> 17:16.080\n where it brought me back to my fighting days.\n\n17:16.080 --> 17:18.240\n It was like the same, that person came out again.\n\n17:18.240 --> 17:20.280\n It was like, well, I didn't even know he was in there.\n\n17:20.280 --> 17:25.280\n It's like they're like an assassin, like a killer.\n\n17:25.920 --> 17:30.920\n Like I felt like a different person.\n\n17:30.920 --> 17:34.600\n Is it echoes of like what Mike Tyson talked about essentially?\n\n17:34.600 --> 17:35.440\n Like the...\n\n17:35.440 --> 17:37.800\n Maybe, but no orgasm in the oceans.\n\n17:37.800 --> 17:41.040\n All the crazy shit that he was saying.\n\n17:41.040 --> 17:44.000\n Is there a violent person in there?\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:44.840\n Oh yeah.\n\n17:44.840 --> 17:47.800\n Yeah, there's a lot of violence in me for sure.\n\n17:47.800 --> 17:49.600\n I don't know if it's genetic or learned\n\n17:49.600 --> 17:52.240\n or it's because during my formative years\n\n17:52.240 --> 17:56.720\n from the time I was 15 till I was 22, all I did was fight.\n\n17:56.720 --> 17:58.160\n That was all I did.\n\n17:58.160 --> 17:59.080\n That was all I did.\n\n17:59.080 --> 18:01.040\n All I did was train and compete.\n\n18:01.040 --> 18:01.880\n That's all I did.\n\n18:01.880 --> 18:03.040\n That was my whole life.\n\n18:03.040 --> 18:04.760\n Is it connected to...\n\n18:04.760 --> 18:07.720\n So your mom and dad broke up early on.\n\n18:07.720 --> 18:10.360\n Is it connected to the dad at all?\n\n18:10.360 --> 18:13.840\n I'm sure it's connected to him also because he was violent\n\n18:13.840 --> 18:16.320\n and it made me feel very scared to be around him.\n\n18:16.320 --> 18:20.880\n But I also think it's connected in who he was as a human\n\n18:20.880 --> 18:23.560\n is transferred into my DNA.\n\n18:23.560 --> 18:25.880\n I think there's a certain amount of...\n\n18:25.880 --> 18:30.400\n I mean, to be prejudiced against myself,\n\n18:30.400 --> 18:32.720\n I look like a violent person.\n\n18:32.720 --> 18:35.520\n If I didn't know me, even the way I'm built,\n\n18:35.520 --> 18:36.800\n not even just the working out part,\n\n18:36.800 --> 18:38.320\n just the size of my hands\n\n18:38.320 --> 18:41.360\n and there's the width of my shoulders.\n\n18:41.360 --> 18:44.920\n There's most likely a lot of violence in my history,\n\n18:44.920 --> 18:47.240\n in my past, in my ancestry.\n\n18:47.240 --> 18:52.240\n And I think we minimize that with people.\n\n18:52.240 --> 18:55.880\n So much of your behavior, when I see my daughter,\n\n18:55.880 --> 18:58.360\n I have one daughter that's obsessive\n\n18:58.360 --> 19:01.240\n in terms of she wants to get really good at things\n\n19:01.240 --> 19:03.280\n and she'll practice things all day long.\n\n19:03.280 --> 19:06.960\n And it's 100% my personality.\n\n19:06.960 --> 19:09.840\n She's me in female form.\n\n19:09.840 --> 19:14.000\n But without the anger as much and without the fear,\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.560\n she has loving household and everything like that.\n\n19:16.560 --> 19:21.280\n But she has this intense obsession with doing things\n\n19:21.280 --> 19:23.400\n and doing things really well and getting better.\n\n19:23.400 --> 19:24.240\n What's the point?\n\n19:24.240 --> 19:26.600\n We have to tell her, stop doing hand springs in the house.\n\n19:26.600 --> 19:29.240\n Stop, stop, come on, just sit down, have dinner.\n\n19:29.240 --> 19:30.240\n Like one more, one more.\n\n19:30.240 --> 19:32.520\n Like she's just like, she's psycho.\n\n19:34.120 --> 19:39.120\n And I think there's a lot of behavior and personality\n\n19:42.480 --> 19:45.720\n and a lot of these things are passed down through genetics.\n\n19:45.720 --> 19:47.480\n We don't really know, right?\n\n19:47.480 --> 19:51.800\n We don't know how much of who you are genetically\n\n19:51.800 --> 19:54.520\n is learned behavior, nature or nurture.\n\n19:54.520 --> 19:57.080\n We don't know if it's learned behavior\n\n19:57.080 --> 19:58.200\n or whether or not it's something\n\n19:58.200 --> 19:59.720\n that's intrinsically a part of you\n\n19:59.720 --> 20:02.000\n because of who your parents were.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:06.640\n I think there's certainly some genetic violence in me.\n\n20:06.640 --> 20:07.480\n There's certainly.\n\n20:07.480 --> 20:08.320\n And then you channeled it.\n\n20:08.320 --> 20:10.480\n So you figured out it's basically your life\n\n20:10.480 --> 20:13.320\n is a productive exploration of how to channel that.\n\n20:13.320 --> 20:18.320\n Yes, how to figure out how to get that monkey to sit down\n\n20:18.760 --> 20:19.880\n and calm down.\n\n20:19.880 --> 20:21.200\n There's another person in there.\n\n20:21.200 --> 20:26.200\n Like there's a calm, rational, kind, friendly person\n\n20:26.360 --> 20:28.320\n who just wants to laugh and have fun.\n\n20:28.320 --> 20:30.640\n And then there's that dude who comes out\n\n20:30.640 --> 20:32.680\n when I did Sober October.\n\n20:32.680 --> 20:33.560\n That guy's scary.\n\n20:33.560 --> 20:34.720\n I don't like that guy.\n\n20:34.720 --> 20:37.440\n That guy just wants to get up in the morning and go.\n\n20:37.440 --> 20:42.440\n It's like, I mean, when I was competing, it was necessary.\n\n20:42.440 --> 20:44.360\n But it makes me remember.\n\n20:44.360 --> 20:48.480\n I didn't really remember what I used to be like until that.\n\n20:48.480 --> 20:51.840\n It's like when I'm working out seven hours a day\n\n20:51.840 --> 20:53.680\n and just so obsessed.\n\n20:53.680 --> 20:55.960\n And all I was thinking about was winning.\n\n20:55.960 --> 20:56.960\n That's all I was thinking about.\n\n20:56.960 --> 20:59.280\n Like if they were working out five hours a day,\n\n20:59.280 --> 21:01.760\n I wanted them to know that I was gonna work out\n\n21:01.760 --> 21:04.480\n an extra three hours and I was gonna get up early\n\n21:04.480 --> 21:05.720\n and I was gonna text them all.\n\n21:05.720 --> 21:07.320\n Hey, pussies, I'm up already.\n\n21:07.320 --> 21:09.520\n Take pictures, send selfies.\n\n21:09.520 --> 21:11.160\n I was like, you're gonna die.\n\n21:11.160 --> 21:13.000\n I kept telling them, you're all gonna die.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.840\n You try to keep up with me, you're gonna die.\n\n21:14.840 --> 21:16.600\n You weren't fully joking.\n\n21:16.600 --> 21:18.040\n No, I wasn't joking at all.\n\n21:18.040 --> 21:19.360\n That's what was fucked up about it.\n\n21:19.360 --> 21:21.480\n This is the scary thing when I interacted with Goggins\n\n21:21.480 --> 21:26.480\n and what I saw in you during that time is like,\n\n21:26.760 --> 21:30.760\n this guy, like, this is why I've been avoiding\n\n21:30.760 --> 21:32.000\n David Ganga's recently.\n\n21:33.640 --> 21:35.040\n Is like, cause he wants to meet,\n\n21:35.040 --> 21:36.960\n he wants to talk on this podcast,\n\n21:36.960 --> 21:39.720\n but he also wants to run an ultra marathon with me.\n\n21:39.720 --> 21:42.160\n And I felt like this is a person,\n\n21:42.160 --> 21:44.440\n if I spend any time in this realm,\n\n21:44.440 --> 21:48.280\n if I spend any time with a Joe Rogan of that sober October,\n\n21:48.280 --> 21:50.880\n like, I might have to die to get out.\n\n21:50.880 --> 21:52.680\n Like, there's this kind of...\n\n21:52.680 --> 21:55.560\n Yeah, there's a competitive aspect that's super unhealthy.\n\n21:55.560 --> 21:57.640\n I mean, you saw the video that we watched earlier today\n\n21:57.640 --> 21:59.400\n of Goggins draining his knee.\n\n21:59.400 --> 22:01.640\n That would stop me from running ever again\n\n22:01.640 --> 22:03.280\n because I would think in my head, okay,\n\n22:03.280 --> 22:04.560\n I'm gonna ruin my cartilage.\n\n22:04.560 --> 22:06.240\n I'm gonna need a knee replacement.\n\n22:06.240 --> 22:08.840\n I would start thinking, I would go down that line,\n\n22:08.840 --> 22:13.720\n but he is perpetually in this push it mindset,\n\n22:13.720 --> 22:16.280\n what he calls the dog in him.\n\n22:16.280 --> 22:19.080\n That dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog.\n\n22:20.040 --> 22:22.560\n And that's who he is.\n\n22:22.560 --> 22:24.520\n That's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational\n\n22:24.520 --> 22:27.720\n and he's fuel for millions and millions of people.\n\n22:27.720 --> 22:28.680\n I mean, he really is.\n\n22:28.680 --> 22:32.600\n He motivates people in a way that is so powerful,\n\n22:32.600 --> 22:35.160\n but it can be very destructive.\n\n22:35.160 --> 22:39.800\n I know now, especially after the sober October thing,\n\n22:39.800 --> 22:41.560\n that that thing's still in me.\n\n22:41.560 --> 22:43.080\n I didn't know,\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:45.480\n so I really haven't done anything physically competitive,\n\n22:45.480 --> 22:48.000\n except one time I was supposed to fight Wesley Snipes.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.320\n It came out then too.\n\n22:49.320 --> 22:50.720\n That came out too.\n\n22:50.720 --> 22:53.800\n That got creepy too, but luckily that never happened.\n\n22:53.800 --> 22:56.760\n But that was many months of training,\n\n22:56.760 --> 22:59.600\n like training twice a day, every day,\n\n22:59.600 --> 23:01.960\n kickboxing in the morning, jiu jitsu at night.\n\n23:01.960 --> 23:04.200\n I was just going and going and going and going.\n\n23:04.200 --> 23:06.880\n And I was just thinking just all day long.\n\n23:06.880 --> 23:09.720\n But it fucks with all the other aspects of your life.\n\n23:09.720 --> 23:10.960\n It fucks with your friendships.\n\n23:10.960 --> 23:13.600\n It fucks with my comedy.\n\n23:13.600 --> 23:14.880\n It fucks with everything.\n\n23:14.880 --> 23:18.480\n Because that mindset is not a mindset of an artist.\n\n23:18.480 --> 23:20.280\n It's a mindset of a conqueror.\n\n23:20.280 --> 23:21.400\n The conqueror. Yeah.\n\n23:21.400 --> 23:22.240\n Destroyer.\n\n23:22.240 --> 23:24.200\n That's why it's so interesting to see Mike Tyson\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:25.320\n make the switch.\n\n23:25.320 --> 23:29.120\n It's clear that whatever that is, however that fight goes,\n\n23:29.120 --> 23:30.920\n there's a switch.\n\n23:30.920 --> 23:32.800\n He stepped into a different dimension.\n\n23:32.800 --> 23:35.040\n Roy Jones Jr. is coming on my podcast soon.\n\n23:35.040 --> 23:38.440\n And Roy's going to be on before the fight.\n\n23:38.440 --> 23:42.640\n I'm so curious to see how it goes down,\n\n23:42.640 --> 23:44.880\n but genuinely concerned.\n\n23:44.880 --> 23:46.840\n Because Mike Tyson is a heavyweight.\n\n23:46.840 --> 23:49.880\n And Roy Jones at his best was 168 pounds.\n\n23:49.880 --> 23:50.760\n And that's a lot.\n\n23:50.760 --> 23:54.600\n I don't know if Roy has that room in his house, mental house,\n\n23:54.600 --> 23:55.920\n of where Mike Tyson goes.\n\n23:55.920 --> 23:57.040\n I don't know.\n\n23:57.040 --> 23:58.440\n I don't know if he has that room.\n\n23:58.440 --> 23:59.600\n Mike doesn't have a room.\n\n23:59.600 --> 24:01.560\n He's got an empire in there.\n\n24:01.560 --> 24:03.040\n He opens up the door.\n\n24:03.040 --> 24:04.000\n He opens up the door.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.120\n There's a whole empire in his head.\n\n24:06.120 --> 24:08.680\n And he's in that firmly.\n\n24:08.680 --> 24:12.520\n When he got out of the weed and started training again,\n\n24:12.520 --> 24:13.720\n you could see it in him.\n\n24:13.720 --> 24:18.000\n And by the way, physically, in person, he looks spectacular.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:20.280\n He looks like a fucking Adonis.\n\n24:20.280 --> 24:22.040\n I mean, he looks ready to go.\n\n24:22.040 --> 24:23.120\n It's crazy.\n\n24:23.120 --> 24:24.520\n Yeah, I watch his videos of him.\n\n24:24.520 --> 24:25.800\n What about you?\n\n24:25.800 --> 24:28.560\n Have you ever considered competing in jiu jitsu?\n\n24:28.560 --> 24:30.160\n No, for that very reason.\n\n24:30.160 --> 24:32.120\n I don't want to get obsessed.\n\n24:32.120 --> 24:34.040\n That's my number one concern.\n\n24:34.040 --> 24:36.800\n I had to quit video games when we were playing video games\n\n24:36.800 --> 24:37.320\n in the studio.\n\n24:37.320 --> 24:39.640\n I had to quit because I was playing five hours a day,\n\n24:39.640 --> 24:40.480\n like out of nowhere.\n\n24:40.480 --> 24:41.840\n All of a sudden, I was playing five hours a day.\n\n24:41.840 --> 24:43.400\n I was coming home late for dinner.\n\n24:43.400 --> 24:46.600\n I was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games\n\n24:46.600 --> 24:47.640\n and playing.\n\n24:47.640 --> 24:48.960\n I get obsessed with things.\n\n24:48.960 --> 24:51.640\n And I have to recognize what that is\n\n24:51.640 --> 24:54.960\n and these competitive things, like competitive, especially\n\n24:54.960 --> 24:57.520\n like really exciting competitive things like video games.\n\n24:57.520 --> 24:58.920\n They're very dangerous for me.\n\n24:58.920 --> 25:02.240\n The ultimate competitive video game is like jiu jitsu.\n\n25:02.240 --> 25:05.280\n And if I was young, I most certainly would have done it.\n\n25:05.280 --> 25:08.240\n If I didn't have a very clear career path,\n\n25:08.240 --> 25:09.640\n it was something that I enjoyed.\n\n25:09.640 --> 25:12.440\n My concern would be that I would become a professional jiu jitsu\n\n25:12.440 --> 25:14.120\n fighter when I was young.\n\n25:14.120 --> 25:15.920\n And then I would not have the energy\n\n25:15.920 --> 25:18.280\n to do stand up and do all the other things\n\n25:18.280 --> 25:20.640\n that I wound up doing as a career.\n\n25:20.640 --> 25:25.240\n When I was 21, I quit my job teaching.\n\n25:25.240 --> 25:27.280\n I was teaching at Boston University.\n\n25:27.280 --> 25:29.000\n I was teaching Taekwondo there.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:33.520\n And I knew, and I also had my own school in Revere.\n\n25:33.520 --> 25:35.400\n I knew I couldn't do it right.\n\n25:35.400 --> 25:38.440\n And also be doing stand up comedy.\n\n25:38.440 --> 25:40.320\n I knew I couldn't do both of those things.\n\n25:40.320 --> 25:41.200\n There was no way.\n\n25:41.200 --> 25:44.480\n You have to be cognizant of that obsessive force\n\n25:44.480 --> 25:45.800\n within you to make sure.\n\n25:45.800 --> 25:49.320\n Yes, I'd have to know how to manage my mental illness.\n\n25:49.320 --> 25:51.560\n That's a very particular mental illness.\n\n25:51.560 --> 25:54.000\n And I think that mental illness, again,\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:59.640\n my formative years from 15 until I was 21ish, 22,\n\n25:59.640 --> 26:03.560\n those years were spent constantly\n\n26:03.560 --> 26:05.720\n obsessed with martial arts.\n\n26:05.720 --> 26:07.040\n That was my whole day.\n\n26:07.040 --> 26:09.240\n I mean, I trained almost every day.\n\n26:09.240 --> 26:11.880\n The only time I would not train is if I was either injured\n\n26:11.880 --> 26:15.640\n or if I was exhausted, if I needed a day off.\n\n26:15.640 --> 26:17.000\n But I was obsessed.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:20.320\n And so that part of my personality\n\n26:20.320 --> 26:22.000\n that I haven't nurtured is always\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.080\n going to be there under the surface.\n\n26:24.080 --> 26:28.320\n And when it gets reignited by something, it's very weird.\n\n26:28.320 --> 26:29.600\n It's a weird feeling.\n\n26:29.600 --> 26:31.760\n And it can get reignited with a video game.\n\n26:31.760 --> 26:33.720\n It can get reignited with anything.\n\n26:33.720 --> 26:38.160\n That obsessive whatever it is, that competitive demon.\n\n26:38.160 --> 26:39.600\n Yeah, the way you talk about guitar,\n\n26:39.600 --> 26:42.080\n I know you would fall in love with playing guitar.\n\n26:42.080 --> 26:44.400\n But I think you're very wise to not touch that thing.\n\n26:44.400 --> 26:45.960\n That's why I won't golf.\n\n26:45.960 --> 26:47.280\n I have friends who want to golf.\n\n26:47.280 --> 26:49.680\n I'm like, mm mm, I don't fucking want that thing.\n\n26:49.680 --> 26:52.200\n So a lot of people ask me like,\n\n26:52.200 --> 26:55.200\n what's Joe Rogan's jiu jitsu game like?\n\n26:55.200 --> 26:59.800\n Like assuming that I somehow spend hours\n\n26:59.800 --> 27:02.480\n rolling with you before and after a track.\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:05.640\n I mean, what's a good, you should at some point\n\n27:05.640 --> 27:06.880\n show a technique or something.\n\n27:06.880 --> 27:07.720\n That'd be fun.\n\n27:07.720 --> 27:10.440\n Sure, I mean, I've got this technique online.\n\n27:10.440 --> 27:15.320\n Oh, I saw you doing, I think, head and arm something online.\n\n27:15.320 --> 27:17.240\n Yeah, I did.\n\n27:17.240 --> 27:19.160\n I fucked my neck up doing head and arm chokes.\n\n27:19.160 --> 27:21.240\n I did them so much that I,\n\n27:21.240 --> 27:24.680\n because you use your neck so much with head and arm chokes,\n\n27:24.680 --> 27:27.320\n I developed like a real kink in my neck.\n\n27:27.320 --> 27:30.000\n And it turned out I had a bulging disc.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.280\n And, you know.\n\n27:31.280 --> 27:33.120\n So you do it on that, just one side?\n\n27:33.120 --> 27:35.800\n Well, it was, no, I could do it on the left side,\n\n27:35.800 --> 27:38.160\n but I definitely am better on the right side.\n\n27:38.160 --> 27:39.400\n The right side was my best side.\n\n27:39.400 --> 27:41.120\n So if you were to compete, let's say,\n\n27:41.120 --> 27:42.480\n like what's your A game?\n\n27:42.480 --> 27:45.040\n Where would you go from standing up?\n\n27:45.040 --> 27:46.680\n How would you go to submission?\n\n27:46.680 --> 27:49.400\n Would you pull guard, would you take down?\n\n27:49.400 --> 27:51.680\n How would you pass guard?\n\n27:51.680 --> 27:52.920\n I don't have good takedowns.\n\n27:52.920 --> 27:54.240\n I was not a good wrestler.\n\n27:54.240 --> 27:57.600\n So I would most likely either pull guard\n\n27:57.600 --> 27:59.240\n or I would pull half guard.\n\n27:59.240 --> 28:00.080\n Do you have a good guard?\n\n28:00.080 --> 28:00.920\n Yes.\n\n28:00.920 --> 28:02.880\n Are you comfortable being on your butt, on your back?\n\n28:02.880 --> 28:04.800\n Yes, I'm very flexible.\n\n28:04.800 --> 28:07.000\n So I have a good, my rubber guard is pretty good.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:07.840\n You go to rubber guard.\n\n28:07.840 --> 28:10.600\n Yeah, I have good arm bars and good triangles off my back.\n\n28:10.600 --> 28:14.000\n But I also have a very good half guard,\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.040\n but my top game is my best.\n\n28:16.040 --> 28:18.520\n I have a very strong top game.\n\n28:18.520 --> 28:19.520\n Do you have a half guard?\n\n28:19.520 --> 28:21.960\n Do you have a preference of like what kind of guard\n\n28:21.960 --> 28:23.440\n and how to pass that guard?\n\n28:23.440 --> 28:28.440\n And like, yeah, like, is there a specific game plan?\n\n28:28.640 --> 28:29.480\n Like, do you?\n\n28:29.480 --> 28:32.720\n Double underhooks from half guard is the game plan for me.\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:34.680\n If I can get double underhooks from half guard,\n\n28:34.680 --> 28:36.240\n I could sweep a lot of people.\n\n28:36.240 --> 28:37.920\n Underhooks of what?\n\n28:37.920 --> 28:38.760\n Sorry, the arms or the legs?\n\n28:38.760 --> 28:41.160\n So half guard, lockdown, right?\n\n28:41.160 --> 28:44.120\n Half guard, go into lockdown, double underhooks.\n\n28:44.120 --> 28:44.960\n Got it.\n\n28:44.960 --> 28:46.320\n Suck the body, suck the body.\n\n28:46.320 --> 28:47.160\n Just pressure.\n\n28:47.160 --> 28:48.800\n And yeah, massive pressure.\n\n28:48.800 --> 28:52.720\n And then inch my way into a position we call the dog fight\n\n28:52.720 --> 28:54.320\n and inch my way to a position\n\n28:54.320 --> 28:56.680\n where I could get the person on their back.\n\n28:56.680 --> 28:57.520\n Yeah, that's what,\n\n28:57.520 --> 28:58.480\n cause you did show me,\n\n28:58.480 --> 29:01.360\n I still disagree with you about the tie thing.\n\n29:01.360 --> 29:02.200\n The tie.\n\n29:02.200 --> 29:03.040\n That you can choke somebody with it.\n\n29:03.040 --> 29:03.880\n Oh, tie is wrong.\n\n29:03.880 --> 29:05.120\n So wrong, so wrong.\n\n29:05.120 --> 29:06.440\n Well, it's not wrong with you.\n\n29:06.440 --> 29:07.520\n With you, it's wrong.\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:08.360\n Cause you know.\n\n29:08.360 --> 29:09.400\n No, I think there's a system.\n\n29:09.400 --> 29:11.880\n I have this thing, Madonna hair,\n\n29:11.880 --> 29:12.960\n we're gonna figure it out.\n\n29:12.960 --> 29:13.800\n Okay.\n\n29:13.800 --> 29:14.640\n But the.\n\n29:14.640 --> 29:16.040\n There's Velcro on the back.\n\n29:16.040 --> 29:17.600\n No, but see, that's, you're just not the.\n\n29:17.600 --> 29:18.440\n You're cheating.\n\n29:18.440 --> 29:20.040\n You're not, you're the exact, that's cheating.\n\n29:20.040 --> 29:24.200\n Yeah, you did, I did feel when you showed me,\n\n29:24.200 --> 29:25.960\n I think you showed me the rubber guard\n\n29:25.960 --> 29:27.040\n cause it's still a guard.\n\n29:27.040 --> 29:28.240\n That's a little bit foreign to me.\n\n29:28.240 --> 29:30.920\n I just felt that you can immediately feel,\n\n29:30.920 --> 29:32.120\n not with the rubber guard,\n\n29:32.120 --> 29:34.600\n but the way you move your body is,\n\n29:34.600 --> 29:37.840\n you're like a Shanji type of guy\n\n29:37.840 --> 29:40.560\n who knows how to control another human being.\n\n29:40.560 --> 29:43.360\n So like some people are a little bit more,\n\n29:43.360 --> 29:44.920\n I would say agile and technical,\n\n29:44.920 --> 29:47.160\n like playful and kind of.\n\n29:47.160 --> 29:48.000\n Loose.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:51.760\n Loose and they work on transition, transition, transition.\n\n29:51.760 --> 29:52.920\n You're a control guy.\n\n29:52.920 --> 29:54.680\n Like you know how to control position\n\n29:54.680 --> 29:56.200\n and advanced position.\n\n29:56.200 --> 29:57.280\n Donna hair is the same way.\n\n29:57.280 --> 29:58.440\n He's all about control.\n\n29:58.440 --> 30:00.280\n My game is smush.\n\n30:00.280 --> 30:01.120\n That's my game.\n\n30:01.120 --> 30:03.200\n Smush you, grab a hold of you.\n\n30:03.200 --> 30:04.960\n Once I have you, why would I let you go?\n\n30:04.960 --> 30:06.880\n That's my thought is like, why would I let you go?\n\n30:06.880 --> 30:09.680\n I just wanna incrementally move to a better position\n\n30:09.680 --> 30:11.240\n until I can strangle you.\n\n30:11.240 --> 30:14.280\n But I'm much more into strangling people\n\n30:14.280 --> 30:15.320\n than anything else.\n\n30:15.320 --> 30:20.320\n Yeah, which is a great MMA approach for jiu jitsu.\n\n30:20.520 --> 30:24.320\n Well, too many people don't tap when you get their arms.\n\n30:24.320 --> 30:26.360\n And I'm not opposed to arm bars.\n\n30:26.360 --> 30:29.360\n I love arm bars, but everybody goes to sleep.\n\n30:30.680 --> 30:33.080\n And quit from pressure too.\n\n30:33.080 --> 30:35.480\n I mean, quit mentally.\n\n30:35.480 --> 30:36.320\n There's nothing like that.\n\n30:36.320 --> 30:37.520\n You can't breathe.\n\n30:37.520 --> 30:40.080\n If you've got a guy who's like a really good top game guy\n\n30:40.080 --> 30:42.800\n and he mounts you, and I'm a big fan of mounting\n\n30:42.800 --> 30:47.360\n with my legs crossed, like a guard, like a top guard.\n\n30:47.360 --> 30:52.240\n And so I can squeeze with both legs, smush.\n\n30:52.240 --> 30:54.880\n And I'm just looking for people to make mistakes\n\n30:54.880 --> 30:57.720\n and slowly incrementally bettering my position\n\n30:57.720 --> 31:00.040\n until I can get something locked up.\n\n31:00.040 --> 31:01.280\n I love jiu jitsu though, man.\n\n31:01.280 --> 31:03.480\n I just wish it didn't injure you.\n\n31:03.480 --> 31:06.440\n Jiu jitsu is like, if your joints were more durable,\n\n31:06.440 --> 31:08.640\n they could figure out a way to make joints more durable.\n\n31:08.640 --> 31:10.600\n God, I could do jiu jitsu forever.\n\n31:10.600 --> 31:12.240\n So much fun.\n\n31:12.240 --> 31:15.480\n I actually, I talked to this roboticist, Russ Tedrick.\n\n31:15.480 --> 31:17.800\n He builds, he's one of the world class people\n\n31:17.800 --> 31:19.200\n that builds humanoid robots.\n\n31:19.200 --> 31:20.600\n You were interested in Boston Dynamics.\n\n31:20.600 --> 31:23.360\n He's one of the key people in that kind of robotics.\n\n31:23.360 --> 31:25.480\n So I asked him the stupidest question of like,\n\n31:25.480 --> 31:30.040\n how far are we from having a robot be a UFC champion?\n\n31:31.400 --> 31:34.120\n And yeah, it's actually a really, really tough problem.\n\n31:34.120 --> 31:38.040\n It's the same thing that makes somebody\n\n31:38.040 --> 31:41.120\n like Danielle Comey on the wrestling side special,\n\n31:41.120 --> 31:42.560\n because you have to understand the movement\n\n31:42.560 --> 31:45.920\n of the human body in ways that's so difficult to teach.\n\n31:45.920 --> 31:47.080\n It's so subtle.\n\n31:47.080 --> 31:49.840\n The timing, the pressure points, the leverage,\n\n31:49.840 --> 31:50.680\n all those kinds of things.\n\n31:50.680 --> 31:52.880\n That's just for the clinch situation.\n\n31:52.880 --> 31:56.680\n And then the movement for the striking is very difficult.\n\n31:56.680 --> 31:58.840\n As long as you're not allowed as a robot\n\n31:58.840 --> 32:03.560\n to use your natural abilities of having a lot more power.\n\n32:03.560 --> 32:06.480\n Right, a lot more power and more durable.\n\n32:06.480 --> 32:07.320\n Right.\n\n32:07.320 --> 32:09.640\n The human body, like especially meniscus.\n\n32:09.640 --> 32:12.040\n Like you see the heel hook game,\n\n32:12.040 --> 32:14.200\n like everybody's involved in leg locks and heel hooks.\n\n32:14.200 --> 32:18.160\n Like all those guys wind up with torched knees.\n\n32:18.160 --> 32:19.520\n Everyone's got torched knees.\n\n32:19.520 --> 32:21.400\n Everyone's knees are torn apart.\n\n32:21.400 --> 32:23.320\n And you don't grow new meniscus.\n\n32:23.320 --> 32:25.640\n You know, that's like one of those joints where,\n\n32:25.640 --> 32:29.720\n man, when it goes, those guys are 28 years old,\n\n32:29.720 --> 32:31.720\n they've blown out knees.\n\n32:31.720 --> 32:33.000\n Let me ask the ridiculous question.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.680\n What do you think, we're talking about cops,\n\n32:34.680 --> 32:38.280\n what do you think is the best martial arts self defense?\n\n32:38.280 --> 32:39.480\n For sure, jiu jitsu.\n\n32:39.480 --> 32:40.320\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n32:40.320 --> 32:41.160\n Wrestling?\n\n32:41.160 --> 32:43.720\n I think grappling, I should say.\n\n32:43.720 --> 32:46.160\n Judo as well, especially in a cold climate,\n\n32:46.160 --> 32:48.720\n if you get someone who's got like a heavy winter jacket on,\n\n32:48.720 --> 32:50.800\n my God, like judo's an incredible martial art.\n\n32:50.800 --> 32:51.640\n Plus concrete.\n\n32:53.040 --> 32:54.600\n That's the worst place to be,\n\n32:54.600 --> 32:57.480\n with a heavy winter jacket with a judo specialist\n\n32:57.480 --> 33:00.320\n and you're standing up with them, oh my God.\n\n33:00.320 --> 33:01.920\n But I think grappling,\n\n33:01.920 --> 33:03.800\n because in most self defense situations,\n\n33:03.800 --> 33:05.760\n it usually winds up with grappling.\n\n33:05.760 --> 33:07.280\n You're definitely better off, though,\n\n33:07.280 --> 33:08.720\n knowing some striking,\n\n33:08.720 --> 33:10.200\n because there's nothing more terrifying\n\n33:10.200 --> 33:11.560\n than when you go to take someone down,\n\n33:11.560 --> 33:14.440\n they actually have takedown skills, but they can fight.\n\n33:14.440 --> 33:16.280\n And so they have takedown defense\n\n33:16.280 --> 33:17.360\n and they know how to fight,\n\n33:17.360 --> 33:19.040\n and then you don't know how to stand up.\n\n33:19.040 --> 33:20.320\n Like the worst thing in the world\n\n33:20.320 --> 33:21.640\n is seeing someone like reaching\n\n33:21.640 --> 33:25.280\n who doesn't know how to do striking and someone cracks you.\n\n33:25.280 --> 33:27.200\n What about all that Krav Maga talk,\n\n33:27.200 --> 33:30.040\n which is like, you know, the whole line of argument\n\n33:30.040 --> 33:31.760\n that says that jiu jitsu and wrestling\n\n33:31.760 --> 33:35.040\n and all of these sports, they fundamentally take you away\n\n33:35.040 --> 33:36.360\n from the nature of violence.\n\n33:36.360 --> 33:38.440\n So they're just teaching you how to play\n\n33:39.400 --> 33:44.160\n versus the reality of violence\n\n33:44.160 --> 33:47.800\n that is involved in like a self defense situation\n\n33:47.800 --> 33:52.040\n that is a totally different set of skills would be needed.\n\n33:52.040 --> 33:55.360\n In general, the people that say that jiu jitsu\n\n33:55.360 --> 33:59.720\n or other martial arts, it's more of a sport\n\n33:59.720 --> 34:03.880\n and they don't really understand violence.\n\n34:03.880 --> 34:06.160\n In general, the people that say that suck.\n\n34:08.200 --> 34:10.440\n Anybody who thinks like, someone's like,\n\n34:10.440 --> 34:12.000\n you know, hey man, I'll just bite you.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.680\n I'm like, are you gonna bite me?\n\n34:13.680 --> 34:14.720\n Okay.\n\n34:14.720 --> 34:15.920\n Do you think I'm gonna bite you too?\n\n34:15.920 --> 34:16.800\n What do you think of that?\n\n34:16.800 --> 34:18.480\n What if I punch you in your fucking face?\n\n34:18.480 --> 34:19.840\n You think you're still gonna bite me\n\n34:19.840 --> 34:21.480\n when you can't even see?\n\n34:21.480 --> 34:24.000\n When you barely even know you're alive\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:25.560\n and I choke you unconscious?\n\n34:25.560 --> 34:27.440\n If someone's really good at jiu jitsu,\n\n34:27.440 --> 34:29.880\n good luck stabbing them with your keys.\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:31.400\n You know, you don't have a chance.\n\n34:31.400 --> 34:32.240\n You don't have a chance.\n\n34:32.240 --> 34:33.080\n If someone's much better than you\n\n34:33.080 --> 34:35.440\n and they trip you and get you on your back\n\n34:35.440 --> 34:37.680\n and then they fucking elbow you in your face\n\n34:37.680 --> 34:39.480\n and then get a head and arm choke on you,\n\n34:39.480 --> 34:41.840\n all that crap, my gosh, it's out the window, son.\n\n34:41.840 --> 34:46.840\n You're way better off learning what works on trained killers.\n\n34:47.240 --> 34:48.920\n Like this whole idea that you're gonna poke someone\n\n34:48.920 --> 34:50.760\n in the eye and then you're gonna kick them in the nuts.\n\n34:50.760 --> 34:53.280\n Like you're going through these drills\n\n34:53.280 --> 34:55.560\n that yeah, it's good to know what to do\n\n34:55.560 --> 34:57.800\n if you run into someone who doesn't know how to fight.\n\n34:57.800 --> 35:00.200\n It's way better to know what to do\n\n35:00.200 --> 35:02.240\n to someone who knows how to fight.\n\n35:02.240 --> 35:03.800\n That's the best thing.\n\n35:03.800 --> 35:07.320\n Learn how to fight against people who know how to fight.\n\n35:07.320 --> 35:09.920\n Like all that practice self defense\n\n35:09.920 --> 35:11.680\n and they go, it's gonna come at you with a knife.\n\n35:11.680 --> 35:13.240\n You're gonna grab the wrist and do that.\n\n35:13.240 --> 35:16.760\n Like it's good to know self defense,\n\n35:16.760 --> 35:18.880\n but it's much more important\n\n35:18.880 --> 35:22.080\n to understand martial arts comprehensively.\n\n35:22.080 --> 35:24.360\n When you understand martial arts comprehensively,\n\n35:24.360 --> 35:27.400\n like there's no, I shouldn't say there's no Krav Maga guys,\n\n35:27.400 --> 35:32.040\n but it would be shocking if a Krav Maga guy\n\n35:32.040 --> 35:34.560\n and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight\n\n35:34.560 --> 35:35.720\n and the mixed martial arts guy\n\n35:35.720 --> 35:39.440\n who's a trained killer all around didn't fuck that guy up.\n\n35:39.440 --> 35:42.000\n That's what I would expect would happen.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.680\n I would not think that some guy\n\n35:44.680 --> 35:48.080\n who has a little bit of this and a little bit of that\n\n35:48.080 --> 35:50.600\n and prepares for the streets is gonna be able\n\n35:50.600 --> 35:53.320\n to handle a person who trains with killers\n\n35:53.320 --> 35:54.520\n on a day to day basis,\n\n35:54.520 --> 35:56.320\n who rolls with jujitsu black belts,\n\n35:56.320 --> 35:58.120\n who trains with Muay Thai champions.\n\n35:58.120 --> 36:01.880\n Like the best martial arts are the martial arts\n\n36:01.880 --> 36:03.800\n that work on martial artists,\n\n36:03.800 --> 36:06.400\n not the martial arts that work on untrained people.\n\n36:06.400 --> 36:08.120\n What about, we're in Texas now.\n\n36:08.120 --> 36:09.360\n What about guns?\n\n36:09.360 --> 36:10.760\n Well, that's the best martial art.\n\n36:10.760 --> 36:14.960\n No, but would you, like in this crazy time,\n\n36:14.960 --> 36:17.040\n should people carry guns?\n\n36:17.040 --> 36:19.200\n It's not a bad idea to have a gun\n\n36:19.200 --> 36:22.240\n because if you need a gun, you have a gun.\n\n36:22.240 --> 36:24.040\n And if you don't need a gun,\n\n36:24.040 --> 36:25.680\n if you're a person with self control,\n\n36:25.680 --> 36:26.800\n you're not gonna use it.\n\n36:26.800 --> 36:28.440\n You're not gonna just randomly use it,\n\n36:28.440 --> 36:30.480\n but you have something to protect you.\n\n36:30.480 --> 36:32.280\n This is the whole idea of the Second Amendment.\n\n36:32.280 --> 36:33.320\n The whole idea of the Second Amendment\n\n36:33.320 --> 36:34.920\n gets distorted by mass shootings\n\n36:34.920 --> 36:37.200\n or by terrible people who murder people\n\n36:37.200 --> 36:38.080\n and do terrible things.\n\n36:38.080 --> 36:40.920\n But all those things are real,\n\n36:40.920 --> 36:45.920\n but they don't take away from the fundamental efficacy\n\n36:46.160 --> 36:49.200\n of having a firearm and defending your family\n\n36:49.200 --> 36:50.760\n or defending your life.\n\n36:50.760 --> 36:53.200\n And there are real live situations\n\n36:53.200 --> 36:55.520\n where people have had firearms\n\n36:55.520 --> 36:58.160\n and it's protected them or their loved ones\n\n36:58.160 --> 36:59.880\n or they've stopped shooters.\n\n36:59.880 --> 37:01.640\n There's many of these stories,\n\n37:01.640 --> 37:02.840\n but people don't like those stories\n\n37:02.840 --> 37:06.760\n because then it tends to lead to this gun culture argument,\n\n37:06.760 --> 37:08.520\n this pro gun culture argument\n\n37:08.520 --> 37:11.200\n that people find very uncomfortable.\n\n37:11.200 --> 37:13.000\n Human beings are messy\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.280\n and we're messy in so many different ways, right?\n\n37:15.280 --> 37:19.040\n We're messy emotionally, we're messy physically,\n\n37:19.040 --> 37:22.160\n but we're also messy in what's good or bad.\n\n37:22.160 --> 37:23.800\n We want things to be binary.\n\n37:23.800 --> 37:27.280\n We want things to be right or wrong, one or zero.\n\n37:27.280 --> 37:31.280\n And they're not, but there is crime in the world.\n\n37:31.280 --> 37:32.760\n There is violence in the world\n\n37:32.760 --> 37:35.080\n and you're better off knowing how to fight\n\n37:35.080 --> 37:37.800\n and you're better off knowing how to defend yourself\n\n37:37.800 --> 37:39.600\n and you're better off having a gun.\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:41.920\n And I generally think that guns,\n\n37:41.920 --> 37:44.400\n I do like the idea that guns,\n\n37:44.400 --> 37:46.520\n the Second Amendment helps protect the First Amendment.\n\n37:46.520 --> 37:50.240\n There's a kind of sense that puts me at ease\n\n37:50.240 --> 37:53.560\n knowing that so many people in this country have guns\n\n37:53.560 --> 37:55.520\n that, I mean, Alex Jones,\n\n37:55.520 --> 37:58.400\n I just listened to one episode of Infowars\n\n37:58.400 --> 38:00.040\n for the first time.\n\n38:00.040 --> 38:03.600\n Boy, he reminds me like when I drank some tequila,\n\n38:03.600 --> 38:06.480\n I felt like I'm going to some dark places today.\n\n38:06.480 --> 38:08.600\n That's how I feel like listening to him.\n\n38:08.600 --> 38:13.600\n But he talks about like that he worries about martial law.\n\n38:13.600 --> 38:16.040\n So basically government overreach by,\n\n38:16.040 --> 38:17.840\n which happened throughout history.\n\n38:17.840 --> 38:20.680\n Like there's something to worry about there,\n\n38:20.680 --> 38:22.840\n but it puts me at ease knowing\n\n38:22.840 --> 38:25.760\n that so much of the population has guns\n\n38:25.760 --> 38:28.160\n that people, government would think twice\n\n38:28.160 --> 38:31.280\n before instituting martial law on cities.\n\n38:31.280 --> 38:33.720\n But I actually was asking almost like\n\n38:33.720 --> 38:35.360\n on the individual level,\n\n38:35.360 --> 38:39.400\n I maybe shouldn't say this, but I don't yet own a gun.\n\n38:39.400 --> 38:42.560\n And I felt that if I carry a gun\n\n38:42.560 --> 38:46.200\n statistically just for me as a human,\n\n38:46.200 --> 38:47.240\n knowing my psychology,\n\n38:47.240 --> 38:49.880\n I feel like I'm more likely to die.\n\n38:49.880 --> 38:53.640\n Like I feel like I would put myself in situations\n\n38:53.640 --> 38:54.480\n that I shouldn't.\n\n38:54.480 --> 38:57.600\n Like the way I will see the world will change\n\n38:57.600 --> 39:01.200\n because my natural feeling is like when somebody,\n\n39:01.200 --> 39:04.240\n when I was in Philly and I knew late at night,\n\n39:04.240 --> 39:08.400\n if West Philly, when some guy looks at you\n\n39:08.400 --> 39:09.920\n and you can immediately calculate\n\n39:09.920 --> 39:12.000\n that this is a dangerous human being,\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.600\n it starts with a monkey look at first.\n\n39:14.600 --> 39:17.160\n Like I'm a bigger monkey than you.\n\n39:17.160 --> 39:19.240\n And that's where I found like, for example,\n\n39:19.240 --> 39:21.120\n I'll do the beta thing of just looking down\n\n39:21.120 --> 39:23.200\n and turning away and just getting out of trouble\n\n39:23.200 --> 39:25.080\n like very politely.\n\n39:25.080 --> 39:28.040\n And basically that kind of approach,\n\n39:28.040 --> 39:30.000\n because if you have,\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.760\n in terms of getting out of serious violent situations,\n\n39:32.760 --> 39:35.560\n like serious something where you could die\n\n39:35.560 --> 39:39.440\n versus if I had a gun, I feel like I would want to be,\n\n39:39.440 --> 39:43.080\n that there would be that cowboy monkey thing\n\n39:43.080 --> 39:45.640\n where I would want to put myself in situations\n\n39:45.640 --> 39:48.800\n where I'm a little bit of a savior, even of myself\n\n39:48.800 --> 39:53.200\n and almost create danger, which can no longer,\n\n39:53.200 --> 39:57.080\n like the escalation of which I can no longer control.\n\n39:57.080 --> 39:59.160\n Well, you're talking about taking a gun somewhere\n\n39:59.160 --> 40:00.640\n versus having a gun in your home.\n\n40:00.640 --> 40:02.200\n Yes, yes, I mean carry on me.\n\n40:02.200 --> 40:03.280\n That's a different situation\n\n40:03.280 --> 40:07.840\n and much harder to get a warrant or a license for that.\n\n40:07.840 --> 40:10.400\n Control, concealed carry licenses,\n\n40:10.400 --> 40:12.320\n especially in Massachusetts, they don't come easy.\n\n40:12.320 --> 40:14.080\n Well message, yeah, that's a whole nother thing.\n\n40:14.080 --> 40:14.920\n Yeah.\n\n40:14.920 --> 40:16.400\n You're saying gun in the home.\n\n40:16.400 --> 40:18.560\n Yeah, gun in the home, having a gun,\n\n40:18.560 --> 40:19.960\n knowing how to use a gun.\n\n40:19.960 --> 40:21.080\n Like I know how to use a gun.\n\n40:21.080 --> 40:23.960\n I've trained many hours,\n\n40:23.960 --> 40:27.240\n learning how to shoot a gun at tactical places.\n\n40:27.240 --> 40:30.800\n There's a bunch of videos of me doing it on Instagram.\n\n40:30.800 --> 40:34.560\n I practice and I think it's good to understand\n\n40:34.560 --> 40:36.160\n how to be accurate.\n\n40:36.160 --> 40:38.880\n So I've been a fan of your podcast for a long time.\n\n40:38.880 --> 40:40.800\n You don't often talk about it\n\n40:40.800 --> 40:42.280\n because you're always kind of looking forward,\n\n40:42.280 --> 40:45.720\n but if you look at the old studio that you just left,\n\n40:45.720 --> 40:48.960\n is there some epic memories that stand out to you\n\n40:48.960 --> 40:52.000\n that like you almost look back,\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:53.800\n I can't believe this happened?\n\n40:53.800 --> 40:57.000\n Oh yeah, almost too many of them to count.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:58.360\n Is there something that pops into mind now?\n\n40:58.360 --> 41:01.320\n All of them, Elon Musk blowing that flamethrower\n\n41:01.320 --> 41:04.320\n in the middle of the hallway, I got a video of that.\n\n41:04.320 --> 41:05.400\n Have you seen the video of it?\n\n41:05.400 --> 41:06.960\n Yeah, I think you posted it on Instagram.\n\n41:06.960 --> 41:08.080\n I think I did too.\n\n41:08.080 --> 41:09.680\n Yeah, he's a mad man.\n\n41:09.680 --> 41:11.560\n Having Bernie Sanders in there,\n\n41:12.560 --> 41:16.160\n just all the fun fight companions we did\n\n41:16.160 --> 41:18.760\n and all the crazy podcasts with Joey Diaz\n\n41:18.760 --> 41:21.240\n and Duncan Trussell and there were so many.\n\n41:21.240 --> 41:22.680\n There were so many moments.\n\n41:24.360 --> 41:27.720\n Podcasts, this is a weird art form\n\n41:27.720 --> 41:30.920\n and it almost sounds silly,\n\n41:30.920 --> 41:32.800\n but it almost seems like something that chose me\n\n41:32.800 --> 41:34.480\n rather than I chose it.\n\n41:34.480 --> 41:36.920\n I think of that all the time in some strange way.\n\n41:36.920 --> 41:40.400\n It's like I'm showing up as like an antenna\n\n41:40.400 --> 41:43.240\n and I just plug in and twist on\n\n41:43.240 --> 41:46.800\n and then I take in the thing and I put it together\n\n41:46.800 --> 41:49.840\n and I'm like a passenger of this weird ride.\n\n41:49.840 --> 41:51.640\n Yeah, you've talked about this before.\n\n41:51.640 --> 41:53.080\n I really like this idea\n\n41:54.920 --> 41:57.840\n that human beings are just carriers of these ideas.\n\n41:57.840 --> 41:59.840\n Ideas are the ones who are breeding.\n\n41:59.840 --> 42:02.920\n So in a sense like the idea found you as a useful brain\n\n42:02.920 --> 42:06.560\n to use to spread itself through the podcasting medium.\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:07.400\n Yeah.\n\n42:11.400 --> 42:12.640\n Because when I think about your podcast,\n\n42:12.640 --> 42:13.800\n I think about Joey Diaz.\n\n42:13.800 --> 42:16.160\n I think about all those comedians you've had.\n\n42:16.160 --> 42:18.560\n I mean, I think you've had Joey on,\n\n42:18.560 --> 42:22.800\n I mean, maybe close to 50 times, some crazy number.\n\n42:22.800 --> 42:27.800\n Is there, I mean, he is over the top offensive,\n\n42:27.960 --> 42:30.600\n just that's who he is to the core.\n\n42:30.600 --> 42:35.600\n Is there some sense where you wondered like\n\n42:38.080 --> 42:42.040\n whether it's right to have the Spotify episode number one\n\n42:42.040 --> 42:44.720\n with Duncan Dressel for five hours?\n\n42:44.720 --> 42:47.160\n No, I wanted to do it that way.\n\n42:47.160 --> 42:50.920\n That's why we wore NASA suits and we got high as fuck.\n\n42:50.920 --> 42:53.160\n It's like, that's the whole idea behind it.\n\n42:53.160 --> 42:54.800\n I mean, can you introspect that a little bit?\n\n42:54.800 --> 42:56.120\n Like, can you think, like, what is that?\n\n42:56.120 --> 42:57.240\n Cause that's rare.\n\n42:57.240 --> 43:02.240\n It's such a rare thing to do because you're not supposed\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:06.680\n to talk to Duncan Dressel with a huge platform\n\n43:06.680 --> 43:08.280\n that you have five hours.\n\n43:08.280 --> 43:09.400\n Why not?\n\n43:09.400 --> 43:12.720\n Because Donald Trump apparently watches your podcast.\n\n43:12.720 --> 43:16.560\n So just the idea that there's these,\n\n43:16.560 --> 43:18.200\n I mean, that's what I think about,\n\n43:18.200 --> 43:21.360\n these CEOs write to me that they listen to the podcast\n\n43:21.360 --> 43:26.280\n that I do and I have somebody like a David Fravor\n\n43:26.280 --> 43:27.800\n and I was nervous about it.\n\n43:27.800 --> 43:29.360\n I was nervous to have a conversation.\n\n43:29.360 --> 43:33.160\n For me, David Fravor is a Duncan Dressel, which is like.\n\n43:33.160 --> 43:36.360\n Just because of his experiences with UFOs.\n\n43:36.360 --> 43:39.040\n Yeah, even just the way he sees the world\n\n43:39.040 --> 43:40.400\n because he is open.\n\n43:40.400 --> 43:41.360\n I don't know if he's always like this,\n\n43:41.360 --> 43:43.600\n but he opened himself to the possibility\n\n43:43.600 --> 43:45.840\n of unconventional ideas.\n\n43:45.840 --> 43:48.720\n Most people in the scientific community kind of say,\n\n43:48.720 --> 43:50.400\n well, I don't really want to believe anything\n\n43:50.400 --> 43:52.960\n that doesn't have a lot of hard evidence.\n\n43:52.960 --> 43:55.000\n And so that was to me like a step.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:58.360\n And as the thing somehow becomes more popular,\n\n43:58.360 --> 44:01.000\n there becomes this fear of like,\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:04.160\n well, should I talk to this person or not?\n\n44:04.160 --> 44:06.920\n And I mean, you're an inspiration in saying like,\n\n44:06.920 --> 44:08.160\n do whatever the hell you want.\n\n44:08.160 --> 44:09.720\n You have to.\n\n44:09.720 --> 44:14.040\n First of all, I have what you call fuck you money.\n\n44:14.040 --> 44:16.160\n And if you have fuck you money, you don't say fuck you.\n\n44:16.160 --> 44:18.160\n What's the point of having the fuck you money?\n\n44:18.160 --> 44:19.560\n You're wasting it.\n\n44:19.560 --> 44:21.040\n Like you're wasting the position.\n\n44:21.040 --> 44:22.760\n Like someone said to me like,\n\n44:22.760 --> 44:24.560\n why do you like sports cars so much?\n\n44:24.560 --> 44:26.480\n Like how many cars do you have, a bunch of cars?\n\n44:26.480 --> 44:28.680\n Because if I was a kid and I said,\n\n44:28.680 --> 44:31.320\n hey, if I was that crazy rich famous guy,\n\n44:31.320 --> 44:33.920\n like I don't want to have a bunch of cool fucking cars.\n\n44:33.920 --> 44:36.200\n Like, so I would do that.\n\n44:36.200 --> 44:39.000\n Like, cause not everybody gets to do that.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.880\n Like if you're the person that gets to do that,\n\n44:40.880 --> 44:42.600\n you're kind of supposed to do it.\n\n44:42.600 --> 44:44.640\n Like that's if you want to,\n\n44:44.640 --> 44:46.280\n if that really does speak to you.\n\n44:46.280 --> 44:49.480\n And, you know, I've talked to you about this before,\n\n44:49.480 --> 44:53.400\n muscle cars, specifically ones from the 1960s\n\n44:53.400 --> 44:54.520\n and the early seventies.\n\n44:54.520 --> 44:56.600\n They speak to me in some weird way, man.\n\n44:56.600 --> 44:57.840\n I could just stare at them.\n\n44:57.840 --> 44:59.480\n Like I have a 65 Corvette.\n\n44:59.480 --> 45:02.400\n I walk around it sometimes at night when no one's around.\n\n45:02.400 --> 45:03.240\n I just stare at it.\n\n45:03.240 --> 45:05.520\n What's your favorite muscle car?\n\n45:05.520 --> 45:09.400\n Like what's your most bad ass late sixties,\n\n45:09.400 --> 45:10.240\n the perfect car?\n\n45:10.240 --> 45:11.080\n Probably that car.\n\n45:11.080 --> 45:12.520\n Probably that 65 Corvette.\n\n45:12.520 --> 45:15.320\n Yeah, I walk around it when no one's around.\n\n45:15.320 --> 45:16.960\n I think I've driven the 69 Corvette.\n\n45:16.960 --> 45:19.600\n Is there a particular year that just?\n\n45:19.600 --> 45:22.160\n 65 is a generation two.\n\n45:22.160 --> 45:24.000\n 69 is generation three.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.800\n 69 is like the, it's even more curvy.\n\n45:26.800 --> 45:29.520\n They're both awesome, just awesome in different ways.\n\n45:29.520 --> 45:33.200\n But I just love muscle cars for whatever reason.\n\n45:33.200 --> 45:36.120\n But the point is like, I like what I like.\n\n45:36.120 --> 45:38.120\n And if I can do what I want to do,\n\n45:38.120 --> 45:39.320\n I should do what I want to do.\n\n45:39.320 --> 45:40.960\n And it's not hurting anybody.\n\n45:40.960 --> 45:43.840\n And the thing is like, I would do the Duncan podcast\n\n45:43.840 --> 45:45.800\n if no one was listening, right?\n\n45:45.800 --> 45:48.240\n If we were just starting to do a podcast together\n\n45:48.240 --> 45:50.800\n and no one cared and it got like 2000 views,\n\n45:50.800 --> 45:53.320\n which we did for years.\n\n45:53.320 --> 45:54.880\n I would do it with Duncan and we would get high\n\n45:54.880 --> 45:57.600\n and we'd talk crazy shit about aliens and spaceships\n\n45:57.600 --> 46:00.960\n and maybe dude, maybe ideas are living life forms\n\n46:00.960 --> 46:01.960\n and they're inside your head.\n\n46:01.960 --> 46:02.800\n And that's how things get made.\n\n46:02.800 --> 46:04.040\n Man.\n\n46:04.040 --> 46:05.560\n Man.\n\n46:05.560 --> 46:08.040\n I've just kind of morphed me and him together in that\n\n46:08.040 --> 46:11.600\n because the life form idea, life form idea is mine\n\n46:11.600 --> 46:14.080\n that I've really, I really think about a lot.\n\n46:14.080 --> 46:17.040\n I think about on a technical side, by the way.\n\n46:17.040 --> 46:18.920\n When I heard you say that, cause I've been thinking,\n\n46:18.920 --> 46:21.360\n I was like, whoa, that's interesting.\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:23.720\n It might be, they might be alive\n\n46:23.720 --> 46:25.720\n because they, I don't know what the fuck they are,\n\n46:25.720 --> 46:28.640\n but when someone has an idea for, you know,\n\n46:28.640 --> 46:30.520\n whatever an invention, a toaster,\n\n46:30.520 --> 46:32.400\n and then they think about this,\n\n46:32.400 --> 46:35.320\n all it need is like these heating elements and a spring\n\n46:35.320 --> 46:37.800\n and then it pops on the stunts, have a timer.\n\n46:37.800 --> 46:39.240\n And then they build this thing.\n\n46:39.240 --> 46:40.720\n Now all of a sudden it's alive.\n\n46:40.720 --> 46:43.400\n It's like you manifested it in a physical form.\n\n46:43.400 --> 46:47.400\n Toaster is not the best example, but a car, an airplane,\n\n46:47.400 --> 46:49.080\n you're thinking about a thing,\n\n46:49.080 --> 46:51.920\n like an idea comes into your head and you can say,\n\n46:51.920 --> 46:53.360\n oh, well, it's just creativity.\n\n46:53.360 --> 46:54.400\n It's a part of being a person.\n\n46:54.400 --> 46:56.120\n That's how we invented tools\n\n46:56.120 --> 46:58.640\n and how, you know, we became better hunters.\n\n46:58.640 --> 47:00.360\n All those things are true.\n\n47:00.360 --> 47:04.400\n I'm not saying that there's some magic to what I'm saying,\n\n47:04.400 --> 47:07.040\n but there's also a possibility\n\n47:07.040 --> 47:09.640\n that we're simplifying something\n\n47:09.640 --> 47:11.640\n by saying that it's just creativity,\n\n47:11.640 --> 47:15.120\n that it's just a natural human inclination to invent things.\n\n47:15.120 --> 47:17.040\n But why?\n\n47:17.040 --> 47:20.680\n Is it possible that ideas like creativity,\n\n47:20.680 --> 47:23.160\n like we are the only animal other than,\n\n47:23.160 --> 47:25.720\n there's a few species that create things\n\n47:25.720 --> 47:28.400\n like bees make beehives and, but it's very,\n\n47:28.400 --> 47:32.160\n they're very uniform, you know, some animals use tools,\n\n47:32.160 --> 47:33.120\n you know, like, you know,\n\n47:33.120 --> 47:35.720\n champs will use like sticks to get termites\n\n47:35.720 --> 47:36.560\n and things like that.\n\n47:36.560 --> 47:39.520\n But there's something about what we do\n\n47:39.520 --> 47:41.840\n that's, it makes you wonder.\n\n47:41.840 --> 47:44.640\n Cause we look at the, just look at this room that we're in,\n\n47:44.640 --> 47:46.400\n look at all these electronics,\n\n47:46.400 --> 47:50.280\n look at all this crazy shit that human beings have invented\n\n47:50.280 --> 47:52.400\n and then built upon others inventions\n\n47:52.400 --> 47:54.080\n and proved and innovated.\n\n47:54.960 --> 47:57.080\n These all came out of ideas.\n\n47:57.080 --> 48:02.080\n Like the idea, it germinates in someone's head,\n\n48:02.240 --> 48:04.160\n it bounces around, they write it down,\n\n48:04.160 --> 48:05.520\n they share it with others,\n\n48:05.520 --> 48:07.440\n the other people who have similar ideas\n\n48:07.440 --> 48:10.040\n or ideas that are complimentary, they work together\n\n48:10.040 --> 48:12.520\n and they change the world.\n\n48:12.520 --> 48:15.120\n And the new thing in that is the idea is not the people.\n\n48:15.120 --> 48:17.000\n It's like, we think we found the ideas,\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.560\n but it's more like the ideas found us.\n\n48:19.560 --> 48:20.480\n Find you, yeah.\n\n48:20.480 --> 48:22.720\n They're literally in the air.\n\n48:23.640 --> 48:24.480\n They come to you.\n\n48:24.480 --> 48:26.040\n I always felt like that with bits.\n\n48:26.040 --> 48:27.960\n Like when I come up with a bit,\n\n48:27.960 --> 48:29.800\n that's why I'm always telling people\n\n48:29.800 --> 48:32.680\n about the Steven Pressfield book, The War of Art,\n\n48:32.680 --> 48:35.440\n because he talks about respecting the muse\n\n48:35.440 --> 48:40.080\n and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down\n\n48:40.080 --> 48:42.400\n and you do the work or you sit down like a professional\n\n48:42.400 --> 48:44.080\n and you talk to the muse,\n\n48:44.080 --> 48:45.760\n like come tell me what to do.\n\n48:45.760 --> 48:47.760\n Like if the muse was a real thing,\n\n48:47.760 --> 48:50.960\n as if the muse is like some mystical creature\n\n48:50.960 --> 48:53.640\n that comes and delivers you ideas.\n\n48:53.640 --> 48:56.760\n Even if that's not real, that's how it works.\n\n48:56.760 --> 48:57.880\n It does work like that.\n\n48:57.880 --> 49:00.120\n If you do treat it like it's a muse\n\n49:00.120 --> 49:01.600\n and you treat it with the respect\n\n49:01.600 --> 49:03.720\n and you treat it like a professional,\n\n49:03.720 --> 49:05.080\n the ideas do come to you.\n\n49:05.080 --> 49:06.400\n I never thought about what he's doing\n\n49:06.400 --> 49:08.880\n is just sitting there waiting for the idea\n\n49:08.880 --> 49:11.000\n that's trying to breed to find him.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:11.840\n Yeah.\n\n49:11.840 --> 49:13.320\n That's a trippy thing.\n\n49:13.320 --> 49:14.800\n If you show up. That's trippy.\n\n49:14.800 --> 49:16.600\n If you show up and put in the time\n\n49:16.600 --> 49:19.080\n and focus your energy on that,\n\n49:19.080 --> 49:23.440\n the ideas, they will arrive, they will arrive.\n\n49:23.440 --> 49:25.480\n And that's the same with writing comedy.\n\n49:25.480 --> 49:26.880\n Like there's been many, many times\n\n49:26.880 --> 49:28.600\n where I'll come home from the comedy store\n\n49:28.600 --> 49:30.440\n and I just sit down and I start writing\n\n49:30.440 --> 49:32.840\n and I just, I got nothing, there's nothing there.\n\n49:32.840 --> 49:35.160\n I'm just writing, it's all bullshit.\n\n49:35.160 --> 49:37.440\n Nothing's good, it's just like, hmm.\n\n49:37.440 --> 49:40.600\n And then all of a sudden, bam, there's the idea.\n\n49:40.600 --> 49:43.480\n And then all of a sudden I can't stop.\n\n49:43.480 --> 49:45.200\n And then, you know, it was a couple hours later\n\n49:45.200 --> 49:46.280\n and I'm like, whoa.\n\n49:46.280 --> 49:47.680\n And then the next night I'm on stage\n\n49:47.680 --> 49:49.720\n and I'm like, how about that?\n\n49:49.720 --> 49:51.280\n Boom, it gets this big laugh.\n\n49:51.280 --> 49:52.760\n I'm like, holy shit.\n\n49:52.760 --> 49:55.440\n And I know that came out of the discipline\n\n49:55.440 --> 49:57.640\n to sit down and call the muse.\n\n49:57.640 --> 50:01.200\n I mean, the cool thing is the ideas have found you\n\n50:01.200 --> 50:03.800\n to like, oh, I'm gonna use this dude.\n\n50:03.800 --> 50:06.520\n Like he seems to have a podcast that's popular.\n\n50:06.520 --> 50:10.200\n I'm gonna breed inside his brain and spread it to others.\n\n50:10.200 --> 50:11.880\n It's the same as.\n\n50:11.880 --> 50:13.960\n Or an inventor, you know, I'm gonna use this guy\n\n50:13.960 --> 50:16.880\n who's like desperately seeking some sort of a product\n\n50:16.880 --> 50:17.720\n to bring to market.\n\n50:17.720 --> 50:19.120\n Some guy who wants to invent things,\n\n50:19.120 --> 50:21.400\n is thinking about inventing things all the time.\n\n50:21.400 --> 50:24.120\n These ideas, they weasel their way into your head.\n\n50:24.120 --> 50:28.920\n And it seems to me also that the frequency\n\n50:28.920 --> 50:32.880\n that your mind operates under has to be correct.\n\n50:32.880 --> 50:34.920\n Because one of the things about creativity seems to be\n\n50:34.920 --> 50:36.880\n if you think about yourself a lot,\n\n50:36.880 --> 50:40.120\n if you're really into yourself or your image\n\n50:40.120 --> 50:44.000\n or you're selfish, those ideas are not,\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:45.520\n they don't find you.\n\n50:45.520 --> 50:46.360\n Yeah, it's funny.\n\n50:46.360 --> 50:48.240\n It stifles the creative.\n\n50:48.240 --> 50:50.600\n Yeah, it stifles the opportunity\n\n50:50.600 --> 50:52.280\n that the idea has to find you.\n\n50:52.280 --> 50:54.960\n Yes, which is one of the reasons why joke thieves,\n\n50:54.960 --> 50:57.520\n people that steal jokes are terrible writers.\n\n50:57.520 --> 50:58.800\n There's never like really good writers\n\n50:58.800 --> 51:00.360\n who are also joke thieves.\n\n51:00.360 --> 51:02.280\n It's just joke thieves.\n\n51:02.280 --> 51:04.960\n And then, you know, when they have to write on their own,\n\n51:04.960 --> 51:08.040\n if they get exposed, they become terrible comedians.\n\n51:08.040 --> 51:11.160\n They're a shadow of what they were\n\n51:11.160 --> 51:12.960\n when they were stealing other people's ideas.\n\n51:12.960 --> 51:14.840\n Because the thing that would make you steal\n\n51:14.840 --> 51:17.880\n a person's idea is that ego part,\n\n51:17.880 --> 51:20.320\n the like the wanting to claim it for yourself,\n\n51:20.320 --> 51:23.040\n the wanting to be the man or the woman.\n\n51:23.040 --> 51:24.760\n You know, I wanna be the person who gets out there\n\n51:24.760 --> 51:27.400\n and says it and everybody's gonna love me for it.\n\n51:27.400 --> 51:30.760\n Like you can't think like that and be creative.\n\n51:30.760 --> 51:34.920\n It requires a humility and it requires a detachment\n\n51:34.920 --> 51:36.760\n from self in order to create.\n\n51:36.760 --> 51:39.320\n Like when I'm writing, I'm blank.\n\n51:39.320 --> 51:40.720\n I'm like, I'm just staring.\n\n51:40.720 --> 51:43.160\n I'm like, I'm just the part of my mind\n\n51:43.160 --> 51:45.880\n that's active is not like me.\n\n51:45.880 --> 51:49.160\n It's like this weird core function part\n\n51:49.160 --> 51:53.680\n where I'm not aware of my personality.\n\n51:53.680 --> 51:56.040\n I'm not aware of any of that.\n\n51:56.040 --> 51:58.120\n I'm just trying to put it together\n\n51:58.120 --> 52:00.240\n in a way that I know works.\n\n52:00.240 --> 52:01.920\n It's just being there, being present.\n\n52:01.920 --> 52:05.160\n Pressfield is just, I'm a big believer just sitting there\n\n52:05.160 --> 52:08.200\n and staring at a blank page, putting in the time.\n\n52:08.200 --> 52:10.200\n Yeah, and sometimes it's not that way.\n\n52:10.200 --> 52:11.480\n Sometimes it's an inspiration.\n\n52:11.480 --> 52:13.480\n Like sometimes I'll be sitting there at dinner\n\n52:13.480 --> 52:15.320\n and I'll be like, I got an idea.\n\n52:15.320 --> 52:16.960\n And my wife's really cool about that.\n\n52:16.960 --> 52:19.160\n I'm like, I have an idea and I blah, blah, blah.\n\n52:19.160 --> 52:20.680\n I have to just run out of the room real quick\n\n52:20.680 --> 52:23.680\n and I write it down on my phone and then I can come back.\n\n52:23.680 --> 52:25.880\n Because those are like little gifts\n\n52:25.880 --> 52:28.440\n that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere.\n\n52:28.440 --> 52:31.880\n And some people rely only on those gifts, you know?\n\n52:31.880 --> 52:33.160\n And I've talked to comics about it.\n\n52:33.160 --> 52:35.320\n They're like, oh, I can't come up with my best ideas\n\n52:35.320 --> 52:36.160\n when I don't write.\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:37.520\n And I'm like, no, I do too.\n\n52:37.520 --> 52:39.200\n I come up with great ideas when I don't write,\n\n52:39.200 --> 52:40.560\n but I also write.\n\n52:40.560 --> 52:41.920\n Like you can do both of those things.\n\n52:41.920 --> 52:43.520\n They're not mutually exclusive.\n\n52:44.760 --> 52:46.920\n You mentioned fuck you money.\n\n52:46.920 --> 52:49.360\n I feel like I have fuck you money now.\n\n52:49.360 --> 52:52.080\n A year ago I was at zero, I have fuck you money now\n\n52:52.080 --> 52:54.560\n because probably my standard is my,\n\n52:54.560 --> 52:57.000\n I don't need much in this world.\n\n52:57.000 --> 53:00.200\n But because also, probably because of you,\n\n53:00.200 --> 53:02.840\n but it's 300 to 400,000 people.\n\n53:02.840 --> 53:04.680\n This isn't every episode I do.\n\n53:04.680 --> 53:07.040\n And that is weird.\n\n53:07.040 --> 53:07.880\n It's definitely.\n\n53:07.880 --> 53:09.320\n That's a successful television show on cable.\n\n53:09.320 --> 53:10.360\n Yeah, it's crazy.\n\n53:10.360 --> 53:11.200\n It's all you.\n\n53:11.200 --> 53:12.520\n Yeah, it's hilarious.\n\n53:12.520 --> 53:13.360\n That's amazing.\n\n53:13.360 --> 53:16.600\n But at this point, that also resulted in\n\n53:16.600 --> 53:19.160\n a few money in a sense that I don't,\n\n53:20.800 --> 53:22.160\n I don't need anything else in this world.\n\n53:22.160 --> 53:26.080\n But so by way of asking, I've looked up,\n\n53:26.080 --> 53:28.560\n you've inspired me for a long time.\n\n53:28.560 --> 53:29.840\n Do you have advice?\n\n53:29.840 --> 53:33.640\n You've done this on the podcast side of life.\n\n53:33.640 --> 53:36.000\n Do you have advice for somebody like,\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:40.400\n for me and somebody like me going on this journey?\n\n53:40.400 --> 53:43.280\n Eric Weinstein is going on this journey.\n\n53:43.280 --> 53:47.440\n Is there advice, both small and big,\n\n53:47.440 --> 53:49.240\n that you have for somebody like me?\n\n53:50.240 --> 53:53.400\n The advice is to keep doing what feels right to you\n\n53:53.400 --> 53:54.960\n and do what you're doing.\n\n53:54.960 --> 53:56.920\n Obviously, it's resonating with people\n\n53:56.920 --> 53:58.440\n if you're getting that big of an audience.\n\n53:58.440 --> 53:59.720\n And I've listened to your podcast.\n\n53:59.720 --> 54:00.760\n You're very good at it.\n\n54:00.760 --> 54:04.160\n So just keep doing it the way you're doing it.\n\n54:04.160 --> 54:06.680\n Don't let anybody else get involved.\n\n54:06.680 --> 54:08.920\n What about, you've connected,\n\n54:08.920 --> 54:11.080\n I think you met Jamie at the Comedy Store.\n\n54:11.080 --> 54:12.480\n I met him at the Ice House.\n\n54:12.480 --> 54:13.320\n At the Ice House?\n\n54:13.320 --> 54:14.160\n Ice House.\n\n54:14.160 --> 54:15.000\n Well, I think I met him at the Comedy Store,\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\n but then we talked at the Ice House.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:17.840\n I mean, what?\n\n54:17.840 --> 54:18.680\n You'd have to ask him.\n\n54:18.680 --> 54:20.560\n Yeah, did you think deeply about,\n\n54:20.560 --> 54:25.200\n because you basically have nobody on your team.\n\n54:25.200 --> 54:27.800\n And so it almost feels like a marriage.\n\n54:27.800 --> 54:32.200\n Were you selective about somebody\n\n54:32.200 --> 54:34.240\n to bring into your little circle?\n\n54:34.240 --> 54:35.920\n Well, Jamie's exceptional.\n\n54:35.920 --> 54:36.760\n He is.\n\n54:36.760 --> 54:38.160\n He's a special.\n\n54:38.160 --> 54:39.000\n I mean, he might've grown.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:40.640\n I don't remember how he was in the early days.\n\n54:40.640 --> 54:42.160\n Maybe you could say, but he's grown.\n\n54:42.160 --> 54:43.320\n He's definitely better at it,\n\n54:43.320 --> 54:45.400\n but right away, he's exceptional.\n\n54:45.400 --> 54:47.920\n He's got very little ego.\n\n54:47.920 --> 54:48.760\n Yes.\n\n54:48.760 --> 54:50.960\n He's not a guy who needs a lot of attention.\n\n54:50.960 --> 54:55.960\n He's not a guy who overestimates anything.\n\n54:55.960 --> 54:59.560\n Like in terms of like a negative or positive,\n\n54:59.560 --> 55:04.560\n like his interpretation of whether it's good things\n\n55:05.200 --> 55:07.520\n that happen to the show or bad things that happen to the show,\n\n55:07.520 --> 55:10.080\n he just takes it all like flat.\n\n55:10.080 --> 55:11.440\n He's chill.\n\n55:11.440 --> 55:12.600\n He's just cool as fuck.\n\n55:12.600 --> 55:14.280\n And he's so smart.\n\n55:14.280 --> 55:16.400\n And he's so good as an audio engineer\n\n55:16.400 --> 55:19.120\n and as a podcast producer, he's the best.\n\n55:19.120 --> 55:20.560\n But he's basically one of the only people\n\n55:20.560 --> 55:21.400\n on this whole team.\n\n55:21.400 --> 55:24.520\n So how do you find, I mean,\n\n55:24.520 --> 55:26.760\n when you let people in,\n\n55:28.280 --> 55:29.880\n I mean, I'm sure other people wanted to get involved.\n\n55:29.880 --> 55:32.120\n Like, why don't you have a cohost that could,\n\n55:32.120 --> 55:34.440\n you basically kind of, well.\n\n55:34.440 --> 55:36.280\n Well, here's the problem with the cohost.\n\n55:36.280 --> 55:37.960\n Like when you and I are talking,\n\n55:37.960 --> 55:41.320\n when we're talking, I'm tuned in to you\n\n55:41.320 --> 55:44.320\n and I'm waiting to hear what you're saying\n\n55:44.320 --> 55:46.440\n and I'm listening and I'm interpreting it.\n\n55:46.440 --> 55:48.800\n And then I'm calculating whether or not\n\n55:48.800 --> 55:52.600\n I have anything to say, whether to let you keep talking,\n\n55:52.600 --> 55:56.120\n whether I maybe have a question that lets you expand further\n\n55:56.120 --> 55:58.440\n or whether I have a disagreement\n\n55:58.440 --> 56:00.920\n or like there's a dance that's going on.\n\n56:00.920 --> 56:04.080\n Now, when there's another person there chiming in too,\n\n56:04.080 --> 56:05.400\n it fucks the dance up.\n\n56:05.400 --> 56:06.360\n It's like dancing.\n\n56:06.360 --> 56:09.560\n Like if you're doing a dance with someone,\n\n56:09.560 --> 56:11.760\n like if you're slow dancing with someone\n\n56:11.760 --> 56:13.240\n and then a third person's there\n\n56:13.240 --> 56:15.040\n stepping on everybody's feet.\n\n56:15.040 --> 56:16.440\n Sometimes it's fun.\n\n56:16.440 --> 56:18.080\n Sometimes having a third person is fun.\n\n56:18.080 --> 56:20.480\n Comedy podcasts, sometimes it's fun.\n\n56:20.480 --> 56:23.080\n Fight companions, yeah, debate structures.\n\n56:23.080 --> 56:24.440\n But even then it gets difficult\n\n56:24.440 --> 56:25.800\n because people talk over each other.\n\n56:25.800 --> 56:30.480\n And also I find that without headphones,\n\n56:30.480 --> 56:32.960\n it's way easier to talk over each other.\n\n56:32.960 --> 56:34.160\n You make mistakes.\n\n56:34.160 --> 56:36.080\n You don't hear it the same way.\n\n56:36.080 --> 56:38.760\n When you have headphones, I hear what you hear.\n\n56:38.760 --> 56:43.680\n It's all one sound and the audience hears exactly,\n\n56:43.680 --> 56:46.720\n or rather I hear exactly what the audience hears.\n\n56:46.720 --> 56:50.240\n Whether it's over here, my voice is louder than yours\n\n56:50.240 --> 56:51.280\n because you're over there.\n\n56:51.280 --> 56:53.280\n And if I don't have headphones on, it doesn't,\n\n56:53.280 --> 56:54.360\n it's not all together.\n\n56:54.360 --> 56:57.960\n On that point, one of the interesting things about your show\n\n56:57.960 --> 57:01.120\n is you don't almost never have done,\n\n57:01.120 --> 57:03.600\n and you just generally don't do remote,\n\n57:03.600 --> 57:04.880\n sorry, not remote calls,\n\n57:04.880 --> 57:07.480\n but you don't go to another person's location.\n\n57:08.640 --> 57:10.480\n We have only done a few, a small handful.\n\n57:10.480 --> 57:13.880\n And just like with Sapolsky, he should do this.\n\n57:13.880 --> 57:16.200\n But I actually, we went back and forth on email.\n\n57:16.200 --> 57:20.320\n I told him he needs to get his ass back in this studio.\n\n57:20.320 --> 57:21.480\n He's working on a book.\n\n57:21.480 --> 57:23.680\n I was a fan of his a long time ago\n\n57:23.680 --> 57:26.280\n because I became obsessed with toxoplasmosis.\n\n57:27.160 --> 57:31.440\n And I've reached out to him a long time ago\n\n57:31.440 --> 57:33.320\n before he was willing to do it.\n\n57:33.320 --> 57:35.720\n But then I caught him in downtown LA.\n\n57:35.720 --> 57:36.680\n He was there for something else.\n\n57:36.680 --> 57:40.520\n And I just greedily snatched up an hour of his time.\n\n57:40.520 --> 57:42.720\n Well, he doesn't get, I think, some of those folks\n\n57:42.720 --> 57:45.520\n don't get how much magic can happen in this podcast studio.\n\n57:45.520 --> 57:48.440\n Like bigger than anything they've ever done\n\n57:48.440 --> 57:49.920\n in terms of their work.\n\n57:49.920 --> 57:51.080\n I'm not talking about reach,\n\n57:51.080 --> 57:54.000\n but in terms of the discovery of new ideas,\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\n there's something magical about conversation.\n\n57:56.000 --> 58:00.040\n Like somebody as brilliant as him,\n\n58:00.040 --> 58:03.040\n if he gives himself over to the conversation\n\n58:03.040 --> 58:04.680\n for multiple hours at a time,\n\n58:04.680 --> 58:06.920\n that's another place where you've been an inspiration.\n\n58:06.920 --> 58:10.920\n Where I'm getting more and more confidence\n\n58:10.920 --> 58:13.800\n of telling people, like in Elon Musk,\n\n58:13.800 --> 58:16.440\n that a lot of CEOs are like,\n\n58:16.440 --> 58:19.080\n well, he has 30 minutes on his schedule.\n\n58:19.080 --> 58:22.200\n I'm like, no, three hours.\n\n58:22.200 --> 58:27.200\n And then they're like, so some say no,\n\n58:27.720 --> 58:28.560\n and then they come back.\n\n58:28.560 --> 58:30.280\n There's people that started coming back to like,\n\n58:30.280 --> 58:32.360\n okay, we're starting to get it.\n\n58:32.360 --> 58:33.680\n They start to get it.\n\n58:33.680 --> 58:36.960\n And you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense\n\n58:36.960 --> 58:39.120\n that there's some value in long form.\n\n58:39.120 --> 58:41.400\n They think that nobody wants to listen\n\n58:41.400 --> 58:43.520\n for more than 30 minutes.\n\n58:43.520 --> 58:45.720\n They think like, I have nothing to say.\n\n58:45.720 --> 58:49.360\n But the reality is if you just give yourself over\n\n58:49.360 --> 58:52.280\n to like the three hours, just let it go,\n\n58:52.280 --> 58:54.560\n three hours, four hours, whatever it is,\n\n58:54.560 --> 58:56.120\n there's so much to discover\n\n58:56.120 --> 58:58.520\n about what you didn't even know you think.\n\n58:58.520 --> 58:59.520\n Yeah.\n\n58:59.520 --> 59:02.320\n Yeah, you have to be confident that you could do it.\n\n59:02.320 --> 59:05.320\n And in the beginning, I just did it\n\n59:05.320 --> 59:07.320\n because that's what I wanted to do.\n\n59:07.320 --> 59:08.680\n And no one was listening.\n\n59:08.680 --> 59:12.280\n So I've always been a curious person.\n\n59:12.280 --> 59:16.720\n So I've always been interested in listening\n\n59:16.720 --> 59:18.160\n to how people think about things\n\n59:18.160 --> 59:21.720\n and talking to people about their mindset\n\n59:21.720 --> 59:26.360\n and just expanding on my own ideas, just talking shit.\n\n59:26.360 --> 59:28.400\n And so we would have these podcasts\n\n59:28.400 --> 59:29.400\n and they would go on forever.\n\n59:29.400 --> 59:34.400\n And my friend Ari, I never let this die down.\n\n59:35.480 --> 59:37.000\n Never let him forget this.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:38.600\n He was always like, you have to edit your podcast.\n\n59:38.600 --> 59:40.160\n I'm telling you right now, you're fucking up.\n\n59:40.160 --> 59:41.440\n I go, why?\n\n59:41.440 --> 59:43.000\n He's like, because people are not gonna listen to it.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:44.640\n I go, they don't have to.\n\n59:44.640 --> 59:45.480\n Yeah.\n\n59:45.480 --> 59:46.320\n I go, you listen to part of it.\n\n59:46.320 --> 59:47.760\n He goes, just do it.\n\n59:47.760 --> 59:49.400\n Just, I'm telling you, trust me,\n\n59:49.400 --> 59:50.800\n cut it down to like 45 minutes.\n\n59:50.800 --> 59:51.840\n That's all you need.\n\n59:51.840 --> 59:54.280\n And I'm like, no, no, I don't think you're right.\n\n59:54.280 --> 59:56.560\n I go, I like listening to long form things.\n\n59:56.560 --> 59:57.920\n No one has that kind of time.\n\n59:57.920 --> 1:00:01.440\n I go, okay, I'm just gonna keep doing it this way, so.\n\n1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:03.440\n And it sticks to your gut.\n\n1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:04.280\n No, he doesn't.\n\n1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:06.520\n His are like two and a half hours long now.\n\n1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:07.680\n That's great.\n\n1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:10.080\n You won, but you wouldn't like say,\n\n1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:12.800\n I mentioned to you this before, and this is gonna happen.\n\n1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:14.440\n It's actually made a lot of progress towards it.\n\n1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:16.280\n I'm gonna talk to Putin,\n\n1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:19.040\n but you wouldn't travel to Putin if you wanted to talk to you.\n\n1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:21.120\n Putin is a dangerous character.\n\n1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:22.640\n He's not.\n\n1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:23.480\n He's not.\n\n1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:26.440\n Have you ever seen the thing with Jerry Kraft\n\n1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:27.880\n where they stole his Super Bowl ring?\n\n1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:28.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:29.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:31.640\n I think that was a little bit of misunderstanding.\n\n1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:33.000\n Oh, really?\n\n1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:33.840\n I think it's a little bit.\n\n1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:35.960\n He just decided he's gonna steal that Super Bowl ring.\n\n1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:36.800\n Kind of.\n\n1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:37.640\n I think it was a...\n\n1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:38.480\n Kind of.\n\n1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:39.760\n Can I see your ring?\n\n1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:41.320\n He shows him his ring and then he puts it on\n\n1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.160\n and says, I can murder somebody with this ring.\n\n1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:44.000\n So he...\n\n1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:44.840\n And then he walks off with it.\n\n1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:46.920\n It's possible he did it as a,\n\n1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:50.360\n he's a big believer in displays of power.\n\n1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:51.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:52.720\n So like, it's possible he did that,\n\n1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:57.720\n but I think he sees himself as like a tool\n\n1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:01.000\n with which to demonstrate that Russia still belongs\n\n1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.600\n on the stage of the big players.\n\n1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:07.800\n And so he, a lot of actions are selected through that lens.\n\n1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:11.200\n But in terms of a human being,\n\n1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:16.040\n outside of any of the evils that he may or may not have done,\n\n1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:21.040\n he is a really thoughtful, intelligent, fun human being.\n\n1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:26.480\n Like the wit and the depth from the JRE perspective\n\n1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:27.600\n is really interesting.\n\n1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:30.880\n I'm like his manager now, selling the, he's a judo guy.\n\n1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:33.240\n Trying to get Trump, he's really good at judo.\n\n1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:34.960\n I have seen him practice judo.\n\n1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:36.320\n He's a legit black belt.\n\n1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:40.360\n And not only that, he loves it, not just skill wise,\n\n1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:42.160\n but to talk about it, to reason about it,\n\n1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:44.520\n to think about it, to MMA as well.\n\n1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:47.600\n So, you know, it'd be a good conversation,\n\n1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:49.160\n but you wouldn't travel to him.\n\n1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:53.800\n Well, that's, hold to your principle.\n\n1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:55.040\n So that's the core of the advice.\n\n1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:56.280\n Just hold to whatever.\n\n1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:58.840\n I would rather, here's the thing.\n\n1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:03.360\n There's not a person that I have to have on the show.\n\n1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:04.200\n Right.\n\n1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:06.320\n And I'm happy to talk to anybody.\n\n1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.000\n I'm just as happy to talk to you as I am to talk to Trump,\n\n1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.080\n as I am to, probably more happy to talk to you,\n\n1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:15.480\n as I am to talk to Mike Tyson, as I am to talk to Joey Diaz.\n\n1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:17.120\n I like talking to people.\n\n1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:19.120\n I enjoy doing podcasts.\n\n1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:21.560\n I enjoy talking to a variety of people\n\n1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:25.200\n and I schedule them based on, I want to like,\n\n1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:27.920\n I try not to get too many right wing people in a row\n\n1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:29.520\n or too many progressive people in a row.\n\n1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.040\n I don't want to get repetitive.\n\n1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:33.280\n I try not to get too many fighters in a row.\n\n1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:34.320\n I try to balance it out.\n\n1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:35.480\n Not too many comedians.\n\n1:02:35.480 --> 1:02:39.160\n Comedians are the one group where I can have three,\n\n1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:40.440\n four in a row, five in a row.\n\n1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.160\n Cause that's my tribe.\n\n1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:43.360\n You know, those are my people.\n\n1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:44.200\n It's easy.\n\n1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:45.800\n We can talk about anything.\n\n1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:46.960\n It's a weird dance.\n\n1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:50.040\n You know, the conversations that you're doing on a podcast\n\n1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:52.960\n are, they're a strange dance.\n\n1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:55.160\n And you want to, you know,\n\n1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:56.920\n you want to not step on your own feet\n\n1:02:56.920 --> 1:03:00.720\n and you want to make sure that you do it in a way,\n\n1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:02.880\n do the podcast in a way that's entertaining for people.\n\n1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:07.280\n And it's conversations are learning how to talk to people.\n\n1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:09.040\n It's a weird skill.\n\n1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:10.720\n It's a weird skill that took a long time\n\n1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:11.800\n for me to get good at.\n\n1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:14.480\n And I didn't know it was a skill until I started doing it.\n\n1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:16.800\n And then I just thought you were just talking.\n\n1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:18.000\n Like, I know how to talk.\n\n1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.040\n We'll just talk to people.\n\n1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:20.880\n And then along the way I realized like, oh,\n\n1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:23.120\n and then when you talk to people that are bad at it,\n\n1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:24.960\n you realize that it's a skill.\n\n1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:28.840\n Like particularly one of the things about my people,\n\n1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:32.560\n about comedians is a lot of them tend to want to talk,\n\n1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:34.000\n but don't want to listen.\n\n1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:35.040\n Right.\n\n1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:39.480\n So they're waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk,\n\n1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:41.440\n but they're not necessarily thinking\n\n1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.520\n about what you're saying, you know?\n\n1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:45.800\n And they're just waiting for their opportunity\n\n1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:47.640\n or they talk over you or they,\n\n1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:50.160\n and I try real hard not to do that and sometimes I fail,\n\n1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:55.000\n but when I'm at my best, I'm dancing.\n\n1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.760\n Yeah, ultimately the skill conversation\n\n1:03:56.760 --> 1:04:00.440\n is just really listening, like really,\n\n1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:01.960\n and listening and thinking.\n\n1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:05.280\n Listening and thinking and being genuinely curious\n\n1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:10.280\n and really having a take on what they're saying\n\n1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:15.040\n and maybe a followup question or maybe,\n\n1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:17.120\n it's gotta be real, it's gotta be authentic.\n\n1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:19.160\n And when it is authentic and it's real,\n\n1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:20.640\n it resonates with people.\n\n1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:21.840\n Like they're listening and they go,\n\n1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:25.360\n oh, like I'm locked in with the way you're thinking.\n\n1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:29.240\n Like you two guys are in a conversation and I'm locked in.\n\n1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:32.840\n When she talks and you listen, I'm listening too.\n\n1:04:32.840 --> 1:04:34.400\n When he says something to her\n\n1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:36.560\n or when she says something to him,\n\n1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:39.080\n like there's a thing that happens during conversations\n\n1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.360\n where you're there, like you're listening to,\n\n1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:45.600\n and it's with me, when I listen to a good podcast,\n\n1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:47.080\n I feel like I'm in the room.\n\n1:04:47.080 --> 1:04:50.000\n I feel like I'm in the room and I'm like the friend\n\n1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.600\n that got to sit down and listen.\n\n1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:55.120\n Like, oh, yeah, that's a great conversation.\n\n1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:56.320\n I love conversations.\n\n1:04:56.320 --> 1:04:58.200\n So I love listening to them\n\n1:04:58.200 --> 1:04:59.680\n and I love putting them together.\n\n1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.360\n And the fact that this podcast has gotten so fucking big,\n\n1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:07.520\n it's stunning to me, it blows me away.\n\n1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:09.320\n I never anticipated it.\n\n1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:11.920\n Never thought for a second that that stupid thing\n\n1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:15.080\n that I used to do in my couch, in my office\n\n1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:18.520\n was the biggest thing I've ever done in my life by far.\n\n1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:20.320\n Like people used to make fun of it.\n\n1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:22.760\n Like there's a comedy store documentary that's coming out\n\n1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:25.080\n and one of the parts of the documentary is my friend,\n\n1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:28.120\n Tom Segura, when he first started doing my podcast,\n\n1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:30.520\n he would be leaving and he would talk to Redband.\n\n1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:32.280\n He's like, what the fuck is he doing?\n\n1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:33.440\n Like, why is he doing this?\n\n1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:34.280\n Like who's listening?\n\n1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:36.320\n He's like, oh, some people like it.\n\n1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:38.960\n And he's like, fucking nonsense, waste of time.\n\n1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:43.120\n And like in the documentary, it shows like 2000 views,\n\n1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:45.160\n like one of the early Ustream episodes.\n\n1:05:45.160 --> 1:05:46.000\n It's hilarious.\n\n1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.280\n And they don't just like it,\n\n1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:50.400\n really they form a friendship with you.\n\n1:05:50.400 --> 1:05:53.840\n It's like, even me when people come up to me,\n\n1:05:53.840 --> 1:05:56.720\n like the love in their eyes is kind of beautiful.\n\n1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:57.560\n It's weird, right?\n\n1:05:57.560 --> 1:05:58.400\n Yeah, it's like.\n\n1:05:58.400 --> 1:05:59.320\n You're a part of their life.\n\n1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:02.560\n Yeah, and I don't know, it's also heartbreaking\n\n1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:05.960\n because you realize you'll never really get to know them\n\n1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:09.860\n back like, because they clearly are friends with you.\n\n1:06:09.860 --> 1:06:11.240\n Yes, yeah.\n\n1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:13.880\n And it's sad to see a person who's clearly brilliant\n\n1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:16.020\n and interesting and is friends with you,\n\n1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:20.160\n but you don't get a chance to return that love.\n\n1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:21.240\n And I mean.\n\n1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:23.680\n My kids, it took them a while to figure out\n\n1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:27.040\n what's going on, but people would come up to me\n\n1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.640\n and they would say something like,\n\n1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:31.920\n hey man, I fucking love you, thanks man.\n\n1:06:31.920 --> 1:06:34.020\n All right, hey brother, nice to meet you.\n\n1:06:34.020 --> 1:06:35.000\n My daughter was like six.\n\n1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:36.480\n She'd be like, do you know him?\n\n1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:37.760\n I'm like, no, I don't know him.\n\n1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:39.520\n She's like, how does he know you?\n\n1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:44.700\n Like, it's a very weird conversation I used to have\n\n1:06:44.700 --> 1:06:47.380\n with young kids when I'd explain,\n\n1:06:47.380 --> 1:06:48.960\n I'd do this thing called the podcast\n\n1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.640\n and millions of people listen.\n\n1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:52.640\n So now one of my daughters is 12\n\n1:06:53.620 --> 1:06:56.560\n and one of her friends is 13 and he's a boy\n\n1:06:56.560 --> 1:06:59.000\n and he goes to school with her and he's obsessed with me.\n\n1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:00.520\n And so she's weirded out.\n\n1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:02.320\n And she says to him, I don't even think you like me.\n\n1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:04.880\n I think you're just into my dad, you fucking weirdo.\n\n1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:07.600\n She's going to have that conversation\n\n1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:09.440\n in a few stages in her life.\n\n1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:12.040\n Like that hard conversation with a boyfriend.\n\n1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:13.760\n Yeah, probably, yeah.\n\n1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:16.080\n That was the thing about men too.\n\n1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:21.080\n This podcast is, my podcast is uniquely masculine.\n\n1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:26.360\n I'm a man and I'm not, I'm also a man\n\n1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:27.880\n that doesn't have to go through some sort\n\n1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:29.320\n of a corporate filter.\n\n1:07:29.320 --> 1:07:31.880\n I'm not going through executive producers\n\n1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:34.240\n who tell me, don't have this guest on,\n\n1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:36.000\n don't talk about that.\n\n1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.460\n We looked at focus groups and they don't seem to like\n\n1:07:38.460 --> 1:07:40.960\n when you do this, like there's none of that.\n\n1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:43.280\n And I just do it.\n\n1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:46.920\n So I have a whole podcast where I just talk about cars\n\n1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:48.000\n and people are like, I don't want to hear you\n\n1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:48.840\n talk about cars.\n\n1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:50.960\n Well, good, congratulations.\n\n1:07:50.960 --> 1:07:51.980\n You found what you like.\n\n1:07:51.980 --> 1:07:54.680\n Here's good news, there's 1500 other ones.\n\n1:07:54.680 --> 1:07:55.800\n Go listen to the other episodes\n\n1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:57.720\n where I don't talk about cars.\n\n1:07:57.720 --> 1:07:59.880\n You don't have to listen.\n\n1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:02.960\n And it's not like your brand, you just are who you are\n\n1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:04.080\n and that's what you do.\n\n1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:08.600\n But it's like, it's authentically what I'm interested in.\n\n1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:11.480\n All the podcasts, whether I'm talking to David Fravor\n\n1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:13.400\n about his experience with UFOs,\n\n1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:17.800\n whether I'm talking to David Sinclair about life extension,\n\n1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:20.320\n whether I'm talking to you about artificial intelligence\n\n1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.580\n or what, it's because I want to talk to these people.\n\n1:08:23.580 --> 1:08:25.720\n And that resonates.\n\n1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:28.600\n I like when people are into shit.\n\n1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:29.760\n I've talked about this before,\n\n1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:32.280\n things that I have no interest in making furniture,\n\n1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:34.100\n but I like this PBS show where this guy\n\n1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:35.800\n makes furniture by hand.\n\n1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:36.640\n I love watching it.\n\n1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:38.160\n Because he's so into it.\n\n1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:39.960\n He's sanding this and polishing that.\n\n1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:40.920\n I'm not going to do that.\n\n1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:42.720\n I don't give a fuck about furniture.\n\n1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:45.360\n Furniture for me is function, like this desk.\n\n1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:48.920\n Function works, but I love when people are into it.\n\n1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:51.720\n I'm happy that someone can make it and they do a great job,\n\n1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:56.680\n but I'm not interested in the task\n\n1:08:56.680 --> 1:08:59.040\n or even the finished product\n\n1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:01.360\n as much as I'm interested in someone's passion\n\n1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:02.200\n for something.\n\n1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:05.260\n The passion that they've put into this, that shines through.\n\n1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:06.180\n Last question.\n\n1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:11.720\n I sometimes ask this just for to, what is it?\n\n1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:15.280\n To challenge, to make people roll their eyes,\n\n1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:17.400\n to make legitimate scientists roll their eyes.\n\n1:09:17.400 --> 1:09:22.400\n Ask, what is the meaning of life, according to Joe Rogan?\n\n1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:24.440\n I do not think there is a meaning.\n\n1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:26.880\n I think there's many, many meanings of life.\n\n1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:30.040\n I think there's a way to navigate life that's enjoyable.\n\n1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:32.320\n I think it requires many things.\n\n1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:35.020\n It requires, first of all, it requires love.\n\n1:09:35.020 --> 1:09:36.420\n You have to have loved ones.\n\n1:09:36.420 --> 1:09:37.720\n You have to have family.\n\n1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:38.960\n You have to have friends.\n\n1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:40.720\n You have to have people that care about you\n\n1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:42.260\n and you have to care about them.\n\n1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:44.600\n I think that is primary.\n\n1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:47.800\n Then it also requires interests.\n\n1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:50.040\n There has to be things that stimulate you.\n\n1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:52.720\n Now, it could be just a subsistence lifestyle.\n\n1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:56.240\n There's many people that believe and practice\n\n1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:59.240\n this lifestyle of just living off the land\n\n1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:01.320\n and hunting and fishing and living in the woods\n\n1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:03.400\n and they seem incredibly happy.\n\n1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:05.680\n And there's something to be said for that.\n\n1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:07.240\n That is an interest, right?\n\n1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:10.160\n There's something and there's a direct connection\n\n1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:12.720\n between their actions and their sustenance.\n\n1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.400\n They get their food that way.\n\n1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:15.600\n They're connected to nature\n\n1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:18.080\n and it's very satisfying for them.\n\n1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:21.800\n If you don't have that, I think you need something\n\n1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:24.040\n that is interesting to you,\n\n1:10:24.040 --> 1:10:26.480\n something that you're passionate about.\n\n1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:28.640\n And there's far too many people that get sucked\n\n1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:33.280\n into living a life where you're just doing a job,\n\n1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:35.100\n you're just showing up and putting in your time\n\n1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:37.120\n and then going home, but you don't have a passion\n\n1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:37.960\n for what you're doing.\n\n1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:42.100\n And I think that's the recipe for a boring\n\n1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:43.640\n and very unfulfilling life.\n\n1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:46.240\n You mentioned love, if we could just backtrack.\n\n1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:49.440\n What, we talked about the demons\n\n1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:51.680\n and the violence in there somewhere.\n\n1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:55.520\n What's the role of love in this, in your own life?\n\n1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.240\n It's very important, man.\n\n1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:00.920\n And that's one of the reasons why I'm so,\n\n1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:04.140\n I'm so interested in helping people.\n\n1:11:04.140 --> 1:11:07.600\n I'm very interested in people feeling good.\n\n1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:09.360\n I like them to feel good.\n\n1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:10.500\n I want to help them.\n\n1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:12.440\n I like doing things that make them feel like,\n\n1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:14.760\n oh, you care about me, like, yeah, I care about you.\n\n1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:15.640\n I really do.\n\n1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:17.140\n Like, I want people to feel good.\n\n1:11:17.140 --> 1:11:19.040\n I want my family to feel good.\n\n1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:20.280\n I want my friends to feel good.\n\n1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:23.980\n I want guests to feel good about the podcast experience.\n\n1:11:23.980 --> 1:11:28.100\n You know, I am, I'm a big believer in as much as I can\n\n1:11:28.100 --> 1:11:32.320\n to spread positive energy and joy and happiness\n\n1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:35.700\n and relay all the good advice that I've ever gotten.\n\n1:11:35.700 --> 1:11:37.660\n All the things that I've learned\n\n1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:38.860\n and if they can benefit people,\n\n1:11:38.860 --> 1:11:41.080\n then I find that those things benefit people\n\n1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:43.080\n that actually improve the quality of their life\n\n1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:46.880\n or improve their success or improve their relationships.\n\n1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:48.480\n I'm very happy to do that.\n\n1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:49.840\n That means a lot to me.\n\n1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:53.960\n The way we interact with each other is so important.\n\n1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:55.840\n It's one of the reasons why, like,\n\n1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:58.920\n if someone gets canceled or you get publicly shamed,\n\n1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:01.040\n it's so devastating because there's all these people\n\n1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:04.520\n that are negative, all this negative energy coming your way\n\n1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:05.340\n and you feel it.\n\n1:12:05.340 --> 1:12:07.620\n As much as I like to pretend that you're immune\n\n1:12:07.620 --> 1:12:08.460\n to that kind of stuff\n\n1:12:08.460 --> 1:12:10.960\n and some people do like to pretend that, you feel it.\n\n1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:14.520\n There's a tangible force when people are upset at you.\n\n1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:17.840\n And that's the same with loved ones or family\n\n1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:20.080\n or anytime someone's upset at you,\n\n1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:22.220\n whether it's a giant group of people\n\n1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:23.920\n or there's a small amount of people.\n\n1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:27.000\n That has an impact on you and your psyche\n\n1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.880\n and your physical being.\n\n1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:31.840\n So the more you can spread love\n\n1:12:31.840 --> 1:12:34.160\n and the more love comes back to you,\n\n1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:36.800\n you also create this butterfly effect, right?\n\n1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:39.200\n Where other people start recognizing like,\n\n1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:42.280\n oh, you know, when he is nice to me, I feel better\n\n1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:43.960\n and then I'm gonna be nicer to people.\n\n1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:45.840\n And when I'm nicer to people, they feel better\n\n1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:48.240\n and I feel better and it spreads outward.\n\n1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:50.160\n And that's one thing that I've done through this podcast,\n\n1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:54.200\n I think, is I've imparted my personal philosophy\n\n1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:57.280\n in kindness and generosity to other people.\n\n1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:00.200\n Yeah, I mean, to correct you, you didn't do it.\n\n1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:02.440\n The ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain\n\n1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:03.280\n have figured out.\n\n1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:05.640\n Yes, the ideas that are alive in the air\n\n1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:07.200\n that made their way into my head.\n\n1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:09.920\n Love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading ideas.\n\n1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:10.960\n They figured out.\n\n1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:14.840\n Yes, probably, man.\n\n1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:16.120\n Probably.\n\n1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:21.000\n So as far as like the meaning of life,\n\n1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.800\n that's a bit, without that, you have nothing.\n\n1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:26.000\n You know, one of the biggest failures in life\n\n1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.880\n is to be extremely successful financially,\n\n1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:29.240\n but everybody hates you.\n\n1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.980\n Everybody hates you and you're just miserable\n\n1:13:30.980 --> 1:13:33.800\n and alone and angry and depressed and sad.\n\n1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:35.840\n You know, when you hear about rich, famous people\n\n1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:39.280\n that commit suicide, like, wow, you missed the mark.\n\n1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:41.560\n You got some parts right,\n\n1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:44.080\n but you put too many eggs in one basket.\n\n1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:46.800\n You put too many eggs in the financial basket\n\n1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:49.800\n or the success basket or the accomplishment basket\n\n1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:52.000\n and not enough in the friendship and love basket.\n\n1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.660\n And there's a balance to that.\n\n1:13:53.660 --> 1:13:56.880\n And when I talked about the violence and all that stuff,\n\n1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:00.360\n like that to me is me understanding, recognizing that\n\n1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:02.880\n is me trying to achieve that balance.\n\n1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:05.380\n It's to like go kill those demons\n\n1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:07.460\n so that this boat is level, you know,\n\n1:14:07.460 --> 1:14:09.580\n because if it's not, then the boat is like this\n\n1:14:09.580 --> 1:14:10.860\n and then everything's all fucked up.\n\n1:14:10.860 --> 1:14:13.200\n And every time we hit a wave, things fall apart.\n\n1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:16.720\n Balance that boat out, figure it out, like know who you are.\n\n1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:18.760\n Some people don't have that problem at all.\n\n1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:20.520\n Some people, they could just go for walks\n\n1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:22.160\n and they're cool as a cucumber.\n\n1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:24.840\n I need more, you know, I need kettlebells.\n\n1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:26.280\n I need a heavy bag.\n\n1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:29.680\n I need the Echo bike, you know, the Air Assault bike.\n\n1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:31.760\n I need some hardcore shit.\n\n1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:33.800\n And if I don't get that, I don't feel good.\n\n1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:35.600\n So I figured that out too.\n\n1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:37.800\n And that makes me a nicer person.\n\n1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:39.400\n That makes my interactions nicer.\n\n1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:44.320\n It changes the quality of my friendships\n\n1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:46.360\n and my relationships with people.\n\n1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:49.200\n I think we mentioned Neuralink.\n\n1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:53.080\n I can certainly guarantee that this is one of the memories\n\n1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:55.680\n I'll be replaying 20, 30 years from now\n\n1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:57.080\n once we get the feature ready.\n\n1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:58.920\n Joe, it's a huge honor to talk to you.\n\n1:14:58.920 --> 1:14:59.760\n I hope.
