differences,\n\n00:09.160 --> 00:12.440\n can that be used to increase the amount of racism\n\n00:12.440 --> 00:14.880\n in the world, can that be used to increase\n\n00:14.880 --> 00:16.920\n the amount of hate in the world?\n\n00:16.920 --> 00:21.920\n My sense is there is such enormous reservoirs\n\n00:24.120 --> 00:27.940\n of hate and racism that have nothing to do\n\n00:27.940 --> 00:31.480\n with scientific knowledge of the data\n\n00:31.480 --> 00:34.080\n that speak against that,\n\n00:34.080 --> 00:39.080\n that no, I don't want to give racist groups\n\n00:39.200 --> 00:42.020\n a veto power over what scientists study.\n\n00:44.200 --> 00:46.960\n The following is a conversation with Richard Heyer\n\n00:46.960 --> 00:49.320\n on the science of human intelligence.\n\n00:49.320 --> 00:51.720\n This is a highly controversial topic,\n\n00:51.720 --> 00:52.960\n but a critically important one\n\n00:52.960 --> 00:54.980\n for understanding the human mind.\n\n00:54.980 --> 00:57.680\n I hope you will join me in not shying away\n\n00:57.680 --> 00:59.980\n from difficult topics like this,\n\n00:59.980 --> 01:03.700\n and instead, let us try to navigate it\n\n01:03.700 --> 01:06.460\n with empathy, rigor, and grace.\n\n01:06.460 --> 01:08.800\n If you're watching this on video now,\n\n01:08.800 --> 01:11.500\n I should mention that I'm recording this introduction\n\n01:11.500 --> 01:14.580\n in an undisclosed location somewhere in the world.\n\n01:14.580 --> 01:17.320\n I'm safe and happy and life is beautiful.\n\n01:18.640 --> 01:20.400\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.\n\n01:20.400 --> 01:22.360\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:22.360 --> 01:25.200\n in the description, and now, dear friends,\n\n01:25.200 --> 01:27.920\n here's Richard Heyer.\n\n01:27.920 --> 01:29.880\n What are the measures of human intelligence,\n\n01:29.880 --> 01:31.560\n and how do we measure it?\n\n01:31.560 --> 01:35.840\n Everybody has an idea of what they mean by intelligence.\n\n01:35.840 --> 01:40.040\n In the vernacular, what I mean by intelligence\n\n01:40.040 --> 01:42.560\n is just being smart, how well you reason,\n\n01:42.560 --> 01:45.160\n how well you figure things out,\n\n01:45.160 --> 01:48.680\n what you do when you don't know what to do.\n\n01:48.680 --> 01:53.680\n Those are just kind of everyday common sense definitions\n\n01:53.680 --> 01:56.660\n of how people use the word intelligence.\n\n01:56.660 --> 01:59.500\n If you wanna do research on intelligence,\n\n01:59.500 --> 02:03.360\n measuring something that you can study scientifically\n\n02:03.360 --> 02:08.360\n is a little trickier, and what almost all researchers\n\n02:09.120 --> 02:12.820\n who study intelligence use is the concept\n\n02:12.820 --> 02:16.980\n called the G factor, general intelligence,\n\n02:16.980 --> 02:21.640\n and that is what is common, that is a mental ability\n\n02:21.640 --> 02:26.500\n that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities.\n\n02:26.500 --> 02:28.500\n What's the origin of the term G factor,\n\n02:28.500 --> 02:29.820\n by the way, such a funny word\n\n02:29.820 --> 02:32.060\n for such a fundamental human thing?\n\n02:32.060 --> 02:35.580\n The general factor, I really started with Charles Spearman,\n\n02:36.540 --> 02:39.060\n and he noticed, this is like, boy,\n\n02:39.060 --> 02:44.060\n more than 100 years ago, he noticed that\n\n02:44.140 --> 02:47.780\n when you tested people with different tests,\n\n02:47.780 --> 02:51.960\n all the tests were correlated positively,\n\n02:53.100 --> 02:57.380\n and so he was looking at student exams and things,\n\n02:57.380 --> 03:01.620\n and he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially,\n\n03:01.620 --> 03:06.380\n and when he used it to look at student performance\n\n03:06.380 --> 03:09.920\n on various topics, he found all the scores\n\n03:09.920 --> 03:11.920\n were correlated with each other,\n\n03:11.920 --> 03:14.480\n and they were all positive correlations,\n\n03:14.480 --> 03:17.540\n so he inferred from this that there must be\n\n03:17.540 --> 03:21.220\n some common factor that was irrespective\n\n03:21.220 --> 03:23.360\n of the content of the test.\n\n03:23.360 --> 03:27.420\n And positive correlation means if you do well\n\n03:27.420 --> 03:29.500\n on the first test, you're likely to do well\n\n03:29.500 --> 03:31.760\n on the second test, and presumably,\n\n03:31.760 --> 03:35.820\n that holds for tests across even disciplines,\n\n03:35.820 --> 03:39.340\n so not within subject, but across subjects,\n\n03:39.340 --> 03:43.020\n so that's where the general comes in,\n\n03:43.020 --> 03:45.020\n something about general intelligence.\n\n03:45.020 --> 03:46.980\n So when you were talking about measuring intelligence\n\n03:46.980 --> 03:50.140\n and trying to figure out something difficult\n\n03:50.140 --> 03:52.300\n about this world and how to solve the puzzles\n\n03:52.300 --> 03:54.740\n of this world, that means, generally speaking,\n\n03:54.740 --> 03:58.140\n not some specific test, but across all tests.\n\n03:58.140 --> 04:01.340\n Absolutely right, and people get hung up on this\n\n04:02.340 --> 04:04.860\n because they say, well, what about the ability\n\n04:04.860 --> 04:08.860\n to do X, isn't that independent?\n\n04:08.860 --> 04:12.000\n And they said, I know somebody who's very good at this\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.360\n but not so good at this, this other thing.\n\n04:15.360 --> 04:17.460\n And so there are a lot of examples like that,\n\n04:17.460 --> 04:21.660\n but it's a general tendency, so exceptions\n\n04:21.660 --> 04:26.500\n really don't disprove, your everyday experience\n\n04:26.500 --> 04:30.740\n is not the same as what the data actually show.\n\n04:30.740 --> 04:32.700\n And your everyday experience, when you say,\n\n04:32.700 --> 04:36.580\n oh, I know someone who's good at X, but not so good at Y,\n\n04:36.580 --> 04:39.100\n that doesn't contradict the statement of about,\n\n04:39.100 --> 04:43.380\n he's not so good, but he's not the opposite.\n\n04:43.380 --> 04:46.520\n He's not, it's not a negative correlation.\n\n04:46.520 --> 04:49.880\n Okay, so we're not, our anecdotal data,\n\n04:49.880 --> 04:53.740\n I know a guy who's really good at solving\n\n04:53.740 --> 04:58.140\n some kind of visual thing, that's not sufficient\n\n04:58.140 --> 05:00.020\n for us to understand actually the depths\n\n05:00.020 --> 05:01.380\n of that person's intelligence.\n\n05:01.380 --> 05:05.080\n So how, this idea of G factor,\n\n05:07.480 --> 05:11.180\n how much evidence is there, how strong,\n\n05:11.180 --> 05:13.700\n you know, given across the decades that this idea\n\n05:13.700 --> 05:16.420\n has been around, how much has it been held up\n\n05:16.420 --> 05:21.420\n that there is a universal sort of horsepower\n\n05:21.580 --> 05:24.020\n of intelligence that's underneath all of it,\n\n05:24.020 --> 05:27.340\n all the different tests we do to try to get to this thing\n\n05:28.300 --> 05:32.000\n in the depths of the human mind that's a universal,\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:34.820\n stable measure of a person's intelligence.\n\n05:34.820 --> 05:38.820\n You used a couple of words in there, stable and.\n\n05:38.820 --> 05:40.580\n We have to be precise with words?\n\n05:40.580 --> 05:42.700\n I was hoping we can get away with being poetic.\n\n05:42.700 --> 05:46.260\n We can, there's a lot about research in general,\n\n05:46.260 --> 05:49.580\n not just intelligence research that is poetic.\n\n05:49.580 --> 05:52.900\n Science has a punetic aspect to it.\n\n05:52.900 --> 05:55.840\n Good scientists are very intuitive.\n\n05:55.840 --> 05:59.220\n They're not just, hey, these are the numbers.\n\n05:59.220 --> 06:02.100\n You have to kind of step back and see the big picture.\n\n06:02.100 --> 06:05.960\n When it comes to intelligence research,\n\n06:05.960 --> 06:09.660\n you asked how well has this general concept held up?\n\n06:09.660 --> 06:13.140\n And I think I can say without fear\n\n06:13.140 --> 06:16.260\n of being empirically contradicted,\n\n06:16.260 --> 06:21.100\n that it is the most replicated finding in all of psychology.\n\n06:21.100 --> 06:22.980\n Now, some cynics may say, well, big deal,\n\n06:22.980 --> 06:25.460\n psychology, we all know there's a replication crisis\n\n06:25.460 --> 06:28.420\n in psychology and a lot of this stuff doesn't replicate.\n\n06:28.420 --> 06:29.700\n That's all true.\n\n06:29.700 --> 06:33.540\n There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying\n\n06:33.540 --> 06:36.780\n the existence of this general factor.\n\n06:36.780 --> 06:38.940\n Let me tell you some things about it.\n\n06:38.940 --> 06:41.420\n It looks like it's universal\n\n06:42.420 --> 06:44.660\n that you find it in all cultures.\n\n06:44.660 --> 06:47.760\n The way you find it, step back one step,\n\n06:47.760 --> 06:51.760\n the way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests.\n\n06:51.760 --> 06:52.780\n What battery?\n\n06:52.780 --> 06:53.800\n You choose.\n\n06:53.800 --> 06:57.100\n Take a battery of any mental tests you want,\n\n06:57.100 --> 07:00.580\n give it to a large number of diverse people,\n\n07:01.520 --> 07:05.740\n and you will be able to extract statistically\n\n07:05.740 --> 07:09.020\n the commonality among all those tests.\n\n07:09.020 --> 07:12.460\n It's done by a technique called factor analysis.\n\n07:12.460 --> 07:17.460\n People think that this may be a statistical artifact\n\n07:17.660 --> 07:21.340\n of some kind, it is not a statistical artifact.\n\n07:21.340 --> 07:22.700\n What is factor analysis?\n\n07:22.700 --> 07:26.180\n Factor analysis is a way of looking at a big set of data\n\n07:26.180 --> 07:29.900\n and look at the correlation among the different test scores\n\n07:29.900 --> 07:33.840\n and then find empirically the clusters of scores\n\n07:33.840 --> 07:35.620\n that go together.\n\n07:35.620 --> 07:37.340\n And there are different factors.\n\n07:37.340 --> 07:39.380\n So if you have a bunch of mental tests,\n\n07:39.380 --> 07:41.120\n there may be a verbal factor,\n\n07:41.120 --> 07:43.320\n there may be a numerical factor,\n\n07:43.320 --> 07:45.900\n there may be a visual spatial factor,\n\n07:45.900 --> 07:50.220\n but those factors have variance in common with each other.\n\n07:50.220 --> 07:52.000\n And that is the common,\n\n07:53.060 --> 07:55.360\n that's what's common among all the tests\n\n07:55.360 --> 07:58.100\n and that's what gets labeled the G factor.\n\n07:58.100 --> 08:01.460\n So if you give a diverse battery of mental tests\n\n08:01.460 --> 08:04.740\n and you extract a G factor from it,\n\n08:04.740 --> 08:08.240\n that factor usually accounts for around half of the variance.\n\n08:08.240 --> 08:12.860\n It's the single biggest factor, but it's not the only factor,\n\n08:12.860 --> 08:17.220\n but it is the most reliable, it is the most stable,\n\n08:17.220 --> 08:22.220\n and it seems to be very much influenced by genetics.\n\n08:23.820 --> 08:28.220\n It's very hard to change the G factor with training\n\n08:28.220 --> 08:32.860\n or drugs or anything else.\n\n08:32.860 --> 08:34.980\n You don't know how to increase the G factor.\n\n08:34.980 --> 08:36.920\n Okay, you said a lot of really interesting things there.\n\n08:36.920 --> 08:40.940\n So first, I mean, just to get people used to it\n\n08:40.940 --> 08:43.260\n in case they're not familiar with this idea,\n\n08:43.260 --> 08:45.820\n G factor is what we mean.\n\n08:45.820 --> 08:49.120\n So often there's this term used IQ,\n\n08:50.340 --> 08:53.980\n which is the way IQ is used,\n\n08:53.980 --> 08:57.540\n they really mean G factor in regular conversation.\n\n08:58.900 --> 09:02.640\n Because what we mean by IQ, we mean intelligence\n\n09:02.640 --> 09:04.500\n and what we mean by intelligence,\n\n09:04.500 --> 09:07.300\n we mean general intelligence and general intelligence\n\n09:07.300 --> 09:09.860\n in the human mind from a psychology,\n\n09:09.860 --> 09:12.320\n from a serious rigorous scientific perspective\n\n09:12.320 --> 09:13.900\n actually means G factor.\n\n09:13.900 --> 09:15.780\n So G factor equals intelligence,\n\n09:15.780 --> 09:18.460\n just in this conversation to define terms.\n\n09:18.460 --> 09:22.220\n Okay, so there's this stable thing called G factor.\n\n09:22.220 --> 09:27.220\n You said, now factor, you said factor many times,\n\n09:27.220 --> 09:32.220\n means a measure that potentially could be reduced\n\n09:33.500 --> 09:35.820\n to a single number across the different factors\n\n09:35.820 --> 09:37.180\n you mentioned.\n\n09:37.180 --> 09:42.180\n And what you said, it accounts for half, halfish.\n\n09:45.060 --> 09:46.640\n Accounts for halfish of what?\n\n09:46.640 --> 09:51.640\n Of variance across the different set of tests.\n\n09:51.640 --> 09:56.500\n Set of tests, so if you do for some reason\n\n09:56.500 --> 10:00.940\n well on some set of tests, what does that mean?\n\n10:00.940 --> 10:03.340\n So that means there's some unique capabilities\n\n10:03.340 --> 10:05.900\n outside of the G factor that might account for that.\n\n10:05.900 --> 10:07.500\n And what are those?\n\n10:07.500 --> 10:10.420\n What else is there besides the raw horsepower,\n\n10:10.420 --> 10:13.380\n the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence?\n\n10:13.380 --> 10:16.380\n There are test taking skills.\n\n10:16.380 --> 10:20.880\n There are specific abilities.\n\n10:20.880 --> 10:25.880\n Someone might be particularly good at mathematical things,\n\n10:28.300 --> 10:32.140\n mathematical concepts, even simple arithmetic.\n\n10:32.140 --> 10:34.340\n Some people are much better than others.\n\n10:34.340 --> 10:36.420\n You might know people who can memorize,\n\n10:36.420 --> 10:41.420\n and short term memory is another component of this.\n\n10:42.540 --> 10:46.900\n Short term memory is one of the cognitive processes\n\n10:46.900 --> 10:51.260\n that's most highly correlated with the G factor.\n\n10:51.260 --> 10:56.260\n So all those things like memory,\n\n10:56.260 --> 10:59.940\n test taking skills account for variability\n\n10:59.940 --> 11:02.240\n across the test performances.\n\n11:02.240 --> 11:06.460\n But so you can run, but you can't hide\n\n11:06.460 --> 11:08.540\n from the thing that God gave you.\n\n11:08.540 --> 11:12.940\n The genetics, so that G factor,\n\n11:12.940 --> 11:15.120\n science says that G factor's there.\n\n11:15.120 --> 11:16.900\n Each one of us have.\n\n11:16.900 --> 11:19.380\n Each one of us has a G factor.\n\n11:19.380 --> 11:20.220\n Oh boy.\n\n11:20.220 --> 11:21.380\n Some have more than others.\n\n11:21.380 --> 11:22.820\n I'm getting uncomfortable already.\n\n11:22.820 --> 11:27.820\n Well, IQ is a score, and IQ, an IQ score\n\n11:28.500 --> 11:32.420\n is a very good estimate of the G factor.\n\n11:32.420 --> 11:36.100\n You can't measure G directly, there's no direct measure.\n\n11:36.100 --> 11:39.880\n You estimate it from these statistical techniques.\n\n11:39.880 --> 11:43.080\n But an IQ score is a good estimate, why?\n\n11:43.080 --> 11:46.420\n Because a standard IQ test is a battery\n\n11:46.420 --> 11:48.640\n of different mental abilities.\n\n11:48.640 --> 11:51.380\n You combined it into one score,\n\n11:51.380 --> 11:55.700\n and that score is highly correlated with the G factor,\n\n11:55.700 --> 12:00.140\n even if you get better scores on some subtests than others.\n\n12:00.140 --> 12:02.300\n Because again, it's what's common\n\n12:02.300 --> 12:04.300\n to all these mental abilities.\n\n12:04.300 --> 12:08.200\n So a good IQ test, and I'll ask you about that,\n\n12:08.200 --> 12:13.200\n but a good IQ test tries to compress down that battery\n\n12:13.340 --> 12:16.200\n of tests, like tries to get a nice battery,\n\n12:16.200 --> 12:21.200\n the nice selection of variable tests into one test.\n\n12:21.420 --> 12:24.180\n And so in that way, it sneaks up to this G factor.\n\n12:24.180 --> 12:27.460\n And that's another interesting thing about G factor.\n\n12:28.380 --> 12:32.380\n Now you give, first of all, you have a great book\n\n12:32.380 --> 12:34.180\n on the neuroscience of intelligence.\n\n12:34.180 --> 12:38.300\n You have a great course, which is when I first learned,\n\n12:38.300 --> 12:39.820\n you're a great teacher, let me just say.\n\n12:39.820 --> 12:40.660\n Thank you.\n\n12:42.140 --> 12:44.180\n Your course at the teaching company,\n\n12:44.180 --> 12:45.820\n I hope I'm saying that correctly.\n\n12:45.820 --> 12:47.180\n The Intelligent Brain.\n\n12:47.180 --> 12:50.520\n The Intelligent Brain is when I first heard\n\n12:50.520 --> 12:53.820\n about this G factor, this mysterious thing\n\n12:53.820 --> 12:56.300\n that lurks in the darkness that we cannot quite shine\n\n12:56.300 --> 12:59.000\n a light on, we're trying to sneak up on.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.580\n So the fact that there's this measure,\n\n13:00.580 --> 13:04.820\n a stable measure of intelligence, we can't measure directly.\n\n13:04.820 --> 13:07.820\n But we can come up with a battery test\n\n13:07.820 --> 13:10.300\n or one test that includes a battery\n\n13:10.300 --> 13:15.300\n of variable type of questions that can reliably\n\n13:17.460 --> 13:21.700\n or attempt to estimate in a stable way that G factor.\n\n13:21.700 --> 13:23.340\n That's a fascinating idea.\n\n13:23.340 --> 13:25.860\n So for me as an AI person, it's fascinating.\n\n13:25.860 --> 13:27.900\n It's fascinating there's something stable like that\n\n13:27.900 --> 13:32.020\n about the human mind, especially if it's grounded in genetics.\n\n13:32.020 --> 13:37.020\n It's both fascinating that as a researcher\n\n13:37.100 --> 13:42.100\n of the human mind and all the human psychological,\n\n13:43.220 --> 13:46.560\n sociological, ethical questions that start arising,\n\n13:46.560 --> 13:48.260\n it makes me uncomfortable.\n\n13:48.260 --> 13:50.220\n But truth can be uncomfortable.\n\n13:51.340 --> 13:54.180\n I get that a lot about being uncomfortable\n\n13:54.180 --> 13:56.540\n talking about this.\n\n13:56.540 --> 13:59.760\n Let me go back and just say one more empirical thing.\n\n14:02.060 --> 14:07.060\n It doesn't matter which battery of tests you use.\n\n14:08.700 --> 14:10.700\n So there are countless tests.\n\n14:10.700 --> 14:13.500\n You can take any 12 of them at random,\n\n14:13.500 --> 14:17.100\n extract a G factor and another 12 at random\n\n14:17.100 --> 14:19.940\n and extract a G factor and those G factors\n\n14:19.940 --> 14:23.160\n will be highly correlated like over 0.9 with each other.\n\n14:23.160 --> 14:26.100\n That's very, so it is a ubiquitous.\n\n14:26.100 --> 14:28.500\n It doesn't depend on the content of the test\n\n14:28.500 --> 14:30.260\n is what I'm trying to say.\n\n14:30.260 --> 14:34.020\n It is general among all those tests of mental ability.\n\n14:34.020 --> 14:37.940\n And tests of mental, mental abilities include things like,\n\n14:37.940 --> 14:41.260\n geez, playing poker.\n\n14:41.260 --> 14:46.260\n Your skill at poker is not unrelated to G.\n\n14:46.300 --> 14:49.460\n Your skill at anything that requires reasoning\n\n14:49.460 --> 14:54.300\n and thinking, anything, spelling, arithmetic,\n\n14:54.300 --> 14:59.300\n more complex things, this concept is ubiquitous.\n\n15:00.500 --> 15:03.880\n And when you do batteries of tests in different cultures,\n\n15:03.880 --> 15:05.800\n you get the same thing.\n\n15:05.800 --> 15:08.880\n So this says something interesting about the human mind\n\n15:08.880 --> 15:11.840\n that as a computer is designed to be general.\n\n15:12.780 --> 15:17.780\n So that means you can, so it's not easily made specialized.\n\n15:17.780 --> 15:21.940\n Meaning if you're going to be good at one thing,\n\n15:21.940 --> 15:26.940\n Miyamoto Musashi has this quote, he's an ancient warrior,\n\n15:26.940 --> 15:30.940\n famous for the Book of Five Rings in the martial arts world.\n\n15:30.940 --> 15:34.180\n And the quote goes, if you know the way broadly,\n\n15:34.180 --> 15:36.420\n you will see it in everything.\n\n15:36.420 --> 15:41.420\n Meaning if you do one thing is going to generalize\n\n15:42.660 --> 15:44.500\n to everything.\n\n15:44.500 --> 15:46.620\n And that's an interesting quote.\n\n15:46.620 --> 15:49.540\n And that's an interesting thing about the human mind.\n\n15:50.660 --> 15:54.380\n So that's what the G factor reveals.\n\n15:54.380 --> 15:57.060\n Okay, so what's the difference,\n\n15:57.060 --> 15:58.900\n if you can elaborate a little bit further\n\n15:58.900 --> 16:00.900\n between IQ and G factor?\n\n16:00.900 --> 16:03.560\n Just because it's a source of confusion for people.\n\n16:03.560 --> 16:05.660\n And IQ is a score.\n\n16:05.660 --> 16:08.260\n People use the word IQ to mean intelligence.\n\n16:08.260 --> 16:11.020\n But IQ has a more technical meaning\n\n16:11.020 --> 16:12.740\n for people who work in the field.\n\n16:12.740 --> 16:16.540\n And it's an IQ score, a score on a test\n\n16:16.540 --> 16:18.980\n that estimates the G factor.\n\n16:20.060 --> 16:22.020\n And the G factor is what's common\n\n16:22.020 --> 16:24.200\n among all these tests of mental ability.\n\n16:24.200 --> 16:27.040\n So if you think about, it's not a Venn diagram,\n\n16:27.040 --> 16:30.580\n but I guess you could make a Venn diagram out of it,\n\n16:30.580 --> 16:33.900\n but the G factor would be really at the core,\n\n16:33.900 --> 16:37.540\n what's common to everything.\n\n16:37.540 --> 16:42.540\n And what IQ scores do is they allow a rank order\n\n16:42.540 --> 16:44.500\n of people on the score.\n\n16:44.500 --> 16:46.900\n And this is what makes people uncomfortable.\n\n16:46.900 --> 16:48.920\n This is where there's a lot of controversy\n\n16:48.920 --> 16:51.540\n about whether IQ tests are biased\n\n16:51.540 --> 16:54.380\n toward any one group or another.\n\n16:54.380 --> 16:59.060\n And a lot of the answers to these questions are very clear,\n\n16:59.060 --> 17:02.060\n but they also have a technical aspect of it\n\n17:02.060 --> 17:04.180\n that's not so easy to explain.\n\n17:04.180 --> 17:06.180\n Well, we'll talk about the fascinating\n\n17:06.180 --> 17:08.260\n and the difficult things about all of this.\n\n17:10.700 --> 17:12.560\n So by the way, when you say rank order,\n\n17:12.560 --> 17:15.420\n that means you get a number and that means one person,\n\n17:15.420 --> 17:17.540\n you can now compare.\n\n17:17.540 --> 17:20.900\n Like you could say that this other person\n\n17:20.900 --> 17:23.020\n is more intelligent than me.\n\n17:23.020 --> 17:25.820\n Well, what you can say is IQ scores\n\n17:25.820 --> 17:28.300\n are interpreted really as percentiles.\n\n17:29.220 --> 17:33.300\n So that if you have an IQ of 140\n\n17:33.300 --> 17:35.580\n and somebody else has 70,\n\n17:35.580 --> 17:38.140\n the metric is such that you cannot say\n\n17:38.140 --> 17:42.940\n the person with an IQ of 140 is twice as smart\n\n17:42.940 --> 17:45.980\n as a person with an IQ of 70.\n\n17:45.980 --> 17:49.900\n That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero.\n\n17:49.900 --> 17:53.140\n Now you may think you know people with zero intelligence,\n\n17:53.140 --> 17:57.980\n but in fact, there is no absolute zero on an IQ scale.\n\n17:57.980 --> 18:00.000\n It's relative to other people.\n\n18:01.140 --> 18:03.220\n So relative to other people,\n\n18:03.220 --> 18:06.300\n somebody with an IQ score of 140\n\n18:06.300 --> 18:09.260\n is in the upper less than 1%,\n\n18:09.260 --> 18:12.580\n whereas somebody with an IQ of 70\n\n18:12.580 --> 18:15.500\n is two standard deviations below the mean.\n\n18:15.500 --> 18:18.660\n That's a different percentile.\n\n18:18.660 --> 18:20.920\n So it's similar to like in chess,\n\n18:20.920 --> 18:25.920\n you have an ELO rating that's designed to rank order people.\n\n18:27.740 --> 18:30.500\n So you can't say it's twice one person.\n\n18:30.500 --> 18:33.500\n If your ELO rating is twice another person,\n\n18:33.500 --> 18:35.740\n I don't think you're twice as good at chess.\n\n18:35.740 --> 18:37.580\n It's not stable in that way,\n\n18:37.580 --> 18:39.060\n but because it's very difficult\n\n18:39.060 --> 18:41.440\n to do these kinds of comparisons.\n\n18:41.440 --> 18:45.980\n But so what can we say about the number itself?\n\n18:47.020 --> 18:50.500\n Is that stable across tests and so on, or no?\n\n18:50.500 --> 18:54.060\n There are a number of statistical properties of any test.\n\n18:54.060 --> 18:56.460\n They're called psychometric properties.\n\n18:56.460 --> 18:59.340\n You have validity, you have reliability,\n\n18:59.340 --> 19:02.780\n reliability, there are many different kinds of reliability.\n\n19:02.780 --> 19:05.980\n They all essentially measure stability.\n\n19:05.980 --> 19:09.780\n And IQ tests are stable within an individual.\n\n19:09.780 --> 19:11.940\n There are some longitudinal studies\n\n19:11.940 --> 19:15.840\n where children were measured at age 11.\n\n19:15.840 --> 19:18.140\n And again, when they were 70 years old\n\n19:18.140 --> 19:22.140\n and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other.\n\n19:22.140 --> 19:25.360\n This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland.\n\n19:26.260 --> 19:31.260\n In the 1930s, some researchers decided to get an IQ test\n\n19:31.260 --> 19:35.900\n on every single child age 11 in the whole country.\n\n19:35.900 --> 19:37.340\n And they did.\n\n19:37.340 --> 19:42.340\n And those records were discovered in an old storeroom\n\n19:42.980 --> 19:47.020\n at the University of Edinburgh by a friend of mine,\n\n19:47.020 --> 19:52.020\n Ian Deary, who found the records, digitized them,\n\n19:52.180 --> 19:53.940\n and has done a lot of research\n\n19:53.940 --> 19:57.220\n on the people who are still alive today\n\n19:57.220 --> 19:58.540\n from that original study,\n\n19:58.540 --> 20:00.620\n including brain imaging research, by the way.\n\n20:00.620 --> 20:04.420\n It really, it's a fascinating group of people\n\n20:04.420 --> 20:06.360\n who are studied.\n\n20:08.100 --> 20:09.300\n Not to get ahead of the story,\n\n20:09.300 --> 20:12.540\n but one of the most interesting things they found\n\n20:12.540 --> 20:14.660\n is a very strong relationship\n\n20:14.660 --> 20:19.660\n between IQ measured at age 11 and mortality.\n\n20:21.680 --> 20:24.380\n So that, you know,\n\n20:24.380 --> 20:29.380\n in the 70 years later, they looked at the survival rates\n\n20:30.940 --> 20:33.300\n and they could get death records from everybody.\n\n20:33.300 --> 20:37.140\n And Scotland has universal healthcare for everybody.\n\n20:37.140 --> 20:40.020\n And it turned out if you divide the people\n\n20:40.020 --> 20:44.020\n by their age 11 IQ score into quartiles\n\n20:44.020 --> 20:48.700\n and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later,\n\n20:49.460 --> 20:52.420\n the, I know this is in the book,\n\n20:52.420 --> 20:54.660\n I have the graph in the book,\n\n20:54.660 --> 20:57.820\n but there are essentially twice as many people alive\n\n20:57.820 --> 21:01.820\n in the highest IQ quartile than in the lowest IQ quartile.\n\n21:01.820 --> 21:03.640\n It's true in men and women.\n\n21:05.300 --> 21:06.940\n Interesting.\n\n21:06.940 --> 21:08.100\n So it makes a big difference.\n\n21:08.100 --> 21:12.920\n Now, why this is the case is not so clear\n\n21:12.920 --> 21:15.620\n since everyone had access to healthcare.\n\n21:15.620 --> 21:18.340\n Well, there's a lot, and we'll talk about it, you know,\n\n21:18.340 --> 21:22.100\n just the sentences you used now\n\n21:22.100 --> 21:25.780\n could be explained by nature or nurture.\n\n21:25.780 --> 21:26.980\n We don't know.\n\n21:26.980 --> 21:29.700\n Now, there's a lot of science that starts to then dig in\n\n21:29.700 --> 21:31.700\n and investigate that question.\n\n21:31.700 --> 21:33.700\n But let me linger on the IQ test.\n\n21:33.700 --> 21:37.380\n How are the test design, IQ test design, how do they work?\n\n21:37.380 --> 21:39.980\n Maybe some examples for people who are not aware.\n\n21:39.980 --> 21:44.020\n What makes a good IQ test question\n\n21:44.020 --> 21:48.080\n that sneaks up on this G factor measure?\n\n21:48.080 --> 21:49.740\n Well, your question is interesting\n\n21:49.740 --> 21:53.340\n because you want me to give examples of items\n\n21:53.340 --> 21:55.220\n that make good items.\n\n21:55.220 --> 21:59.420\n And what makes a good item is not so much its content,\n\n21:59.420 --> 22:03.180\n but its empirical relationship to the total score\n\n22:03.180 --> 22:07.740\n that turns out to be valid by other means.\n\n22:07.740 --> 22:12.500\n So for example, let me give you an odd example\n\n22:12.500 --> 22:14.300\n from personality testing.\n\n22:14.300 --> 22:15.560\n Nice.\n\n22:15.560 --> 22:18.020\n So there's a personality test\n\n22:18.020 --> 22:22.740\n called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, MMPI.\n\n22:22.740 --> 22:24.100\n Been around for decades.\n\n22:24.100 --> 22:25.980\n I've heard about this test recently\n\n22:25.980 --> 22:29.240\n because of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial.\n\n22:29.240 --> 22:31.180\n I don't know if you've been paying attention to that.\n\n22:31.180 --> 22:32.020\n But they had psychologists.\n\n22:32.020 --> 22:33.540\n I have not been paying attention to it.\n\n22:33.540 --> 22:35.820\n They had psychologists on the stand,\n\n22:35.820 --> 22:38.900\n and they were talking, apparently those psychologists did,\n\n22:39.860 --> 22:42.020\n again, I'm learning so much from this trial.\n\n22:42.020 --> 22:45.820\n They did different battery of tests\n\n22:45.820 --> 22:50.420\n to diagnose personality disorders.\n\n22:50.420 --> 22:53.300\n Apparently there's that systematic way of doing so,\n\n22:53.300 --> 22:55.740\n and the Minnesota one is one of the ones\n\n22:55.740 --> 22:59.020\n that there's the most science on.\n\n22:59.020 --> 23:00.440\n There's a lot of great papers,\n\n23:00.440 --> 23:03.820\n which were all continuously cited on the stand,\n\n23:03.820 --> 23:05.060\n which is fascinating to watch.\n\n23:05.060 --> 23:06.540\n Sorry, a little bit of attention.\n\n23:06.540 --> 23:07.380\n It's okay.\n\n23:07.380 --> 23:08.220\n I mean, this is interesting because you're right.\n\n23:08.220 --> 23:09.540\n It's been around for decades.\n\n23:09.540 --> 23:11.220\n There's a lot of scientific research\n\n23:11.220 --> 23:14.820\n on the psychometric properties of the test,\n\n23:14.820 --> 23:18.000\n including what it predicts with respect\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:22.320\n to different categories of personality disorder.\n\n23:22.320 --> 23:24.840\n But what I wanna mention is the content\n\n23:24.840 --> 23:26.860\n of the items on that test.\n\n23:26.860 --> 23:31.860\n All of the items are essentially true false items.\n\n23:32.440 --> 23:35.880\n True or false, I prefer a shower to a bath.\n\n23:36.860 --> 23:39.900\n True or false, I think Lincoln\n\n23:39.900 --> 23:42.260\n was a better president than Washington.\n\n23:42.260 --> 23:46.600\n But what of all these, what does that have to do?\n\n23:47.560 --> 23:49.720\n And the point is the content of these items,\n\n23:49.720 --> 23:54.720\n nobody knows why these items in aggregate predict anything,\n\n23:55.360 --> 23:57.900\n but empirically they do.\n\n23:57.900 --> 24:01.880\n It's a technique of choosing items for a test\n\n24:01.880 --> 24:04.840\n that is called dust bowl empiricism.\n\n24:05.800 --> 24:07.440\n That the content doesn't matter,\n\n24:07.440 --> 24:10.640\n but for some reason when you get a criterion group\n\n24:10.640 --> 24:13.600\n of people with this disorder and you compare them\n\n24:13.600 --> 24:16.120\n to people without that disorder,\n\n24:16.120 --> 24:19.200\n these are the items that distinguish,\n\n24:19.200 --> 24:20.640\n irrespective of content.\n\n24:20.640 --> 24:22.700\n It's a hard concept to grasp.\n\n24:22.700 --> 24:25.260\n Well, first of all, it's fascinating.\n\n24:25.260 --> 24:30.260\n But from, because I consider myself part psychologist\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.360\n because I love human robot interaction,\n\n24:35.360 --> 24:36.600\n and that's a problem.\n\n24:36.600 --> 24:39.600\n Half of that problem is a psychology problem\n\n24:39.600 --> 24:40.760\n because there's a human.\n\n24:41.800 --> 24:45.200\n So designing these tests to get at the questions\n\n24:45.200 --> 24:46.440\n is the fascinating part.\n\n24:46.440 --> 24:50.000\n Like how do you get to,\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.700\n like what does dust bowl empiricism refer to?\n\n24:52.700 --> 24:57.460\n Does it refer to the final result?\n\n24:57.460 --> 25:01.540\n Yeah, so it's the test is dust bowl empiricism.\n\n25:01.540 --> 25:04.960\n But how do you arrive at the battery of questions?\n\n25:04.960 --> 25:07.560\n I presume one of the things,\n\n25:07.560 --> 25:10.080\n now again, I'm going to the excellent testimony\n\n25:10.080 --> 25:12.600\n in that trial, they explain it,\n\n25:12.600 --> 25:14.760\n because they also, they explain the tests.\n\n25:16.720 --> 25:19.280\n That a bunch of the questions are kind of\n\n25:20.320 --> 25:24.040\n make you forget that you're taking a test.\n\n25:24.040 --> 25:26.720\n Like it makes it very difficult for you\n\n25:26.720 --> 25:31.640\n to somehow figure out what you're supposed to answer.\n\n25:31.640 --> 25:34.120\n Yes, it's called social desirability.\n\n25:34.120 --> 25:35.580\n But we're getting a little far afield\n\n25:35.580 --> 25:37.400\n because I only wanted to give that example\n\n25:37.400 --> 25:39.200\n of dust bowl empiricism.\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:44.400\n When we talk about the items on an IQ test,\n\n25:44.400 --> 25:49.400\n many of those items in the dust bowl empiricism method\n\n25:50.640 --> 25:52.960\n have no face validity.\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:56.440\n In other words, they don't look like they measure anything.\n\n25:56.440 --> 25:57.540\n Yes.\n\n25:57.540 --> 25:59.920\n Whereas most intelligence tests,\n\n25:59.920 --> 26:02.220\n the items actually look like they're measuring\n\n26:02.220 --> 26:03.880\n some mental ability.\n\n26:03.880 --> 26:05.320\n So here's one of the.\n\n26:05.320 --> 26:07.000\n So you were bringing that up as an example\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.200\n as what it is not.\n\n26:08.200 --> 26:09.040\n Yes.\n\n26:09.040 --> 26:09.860\n Got it.\n\n26:09.860 --> 26:10.700\n Okay.\n\n26:10.700 --> 26:12.880\n So I don't want to go too far afield on it.\n\n26:12.880 --> 26:16.120\n Too far afield is actually one of the names of this podcast.\n\n26:16.120 --> 26:19.080\n So I should mention that.\n\n26:19.080 --> 26:20.000\n Far afield.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.120\n Far afield.\n\n26:21.120 --> 26:22.240\n Yeah, so anyway, sorry.\n\n26:22.240 --> 26:25.000\n So they feel the questions look like\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:28.040\n they pass the face validity test.\n\n26:28.040 --> 26:29.720\n And some more than others.\n\n26:29.720 --> 26:32.680\n So for example, let me give you a couple of things here.\n\n26:32.680 --> 26:37.320\n If I, one of the subtests on a standard IQ test\n\n26:37.320 --> 26:39.560\n is general information.\n\n26:40.860 --> 26:41.880\n Let me just think a little bit\n\n26:41.880 --> 26:44.360\n because I don't want to give you the actual item.\n\n26:44.360 --> 26:49.360\n But if I said, how far is it between Washington DC\n\n26:49.820 --> 26:51.240\n and Miami, Florida?\n\n26:52.320 --> 26:54.740\n Within 500 miles plus or minus.\n\n26:55.700 --> 27:00.080\n Well, you know, it's not a fact most people memorize,\n\n27:00.080 --> 27:02.720\n but you know something about geography.\n\n27:02.720 --> 27:04.480\n You say, well, I flew there once.\n\n27:04.480 --> 27:06.600\n I know planes fly for 500 miles.\n\n27:06.600 --> 27:09.200\n You know, you can kind of make an estimate.\n\n27:10.360 --> 27:13.900\n But it's also seems like it would be very cultural,\n\n27:15.280 --> 27:20.240\n you know, so there's that kind of general information.\n\n27:20.240 --> 27:22.520\n Then there's vocabulary test.\n\n27:22.520 --> 27:27.520\n What does regatta mean?\n\n27:27.520 --> 27:31.320\n And I choose that word because that word was removed\n\n27:31.320 --> 27:33.760\n from the IQ test because people complained\n\n27:33.760 --> 27:38.280\n that disadvantaged people would not know that word\n\n27:38.280 --> 27:41.440\n just from their everyday life.\n\n27:41.440 --> 27:43.920\n Okay, here's another example\n\n27:43.920 --> 27:46.520\n from a different kind of subtest on.\n\n27:46.520 --> 27:48.200\n What's regatta, by the way?\n\n27:48.200 --> 27:50.400\n Regatta is a.\n\n27:50.400 --> 27:51.640\n I think I'm disadvantaged.\n\n27:51.640 --> 27:54.800\n A sailing competition, a competition with boats.\n\n27:54.800 --> 27:58.760\n Not necessarily sailing, but a competition with boats.\n\n27:58.760 --> 28:02.200\n Yep, yep, I'm probably disadvantaged in that way.\n\n28:02.200 --> 28:04.960\n Okay, excellent, so that was removed anyway you were saying.\n\n28:04.960 --> 28:07.840\n Okay, so here's another subtest.\n\n28:07.840 --> 28:09.840\n I'm gonna repeat a string of numbers,\n\n28:09.840 --> 28:12.680\n and when I'm done, I want you to repeat them back to me.\n\n28:12.680 --> 28:13.720\n Ready?\n\n28:13.720 --> 28:18.720\n Okay, seven, four, two, eight, one, six.\n\n28:21.540 --> 28:22.560\n That's way too many.\n\n28:22.560 --> 28:25.160\n Seven, four, two, eight, one, six.\n\n28:25.160 --> 28:26.280\n Okay, you get the idea.\n\n28:26.280 --> 28:30.800\n Now the actual test starts with a smaller number,\n\n28:30.800 --> 28:33.500\n like two numbers, and then as people get it right,\n\n28:33.500 --> 28:36.520\n you keep going, adding to the string of numbers\n\n28:36.520 --> 28:38.600\n until they can't do it anymore.\n\n28:38.600 --> 28:40.720\n Okay, but now try this.\n\n28:40.720 --> 28:43.760\n I'm gonna say some numbers, and when I'm done,\n\n28:43.760 --> 28:46.640\n I want you to repeat them to me backwards.\n\n28:46.640 --> 28:47.800\n I quit.\n\n28:47.800 --> 28:51.520\n Okay, now, so I gave you some examples\n\n28:51.520 --> 28:53.600\n of the kind of items on an IQ test.\n\n28:53.600 --> 28:58.600\n General information, I can't even remember all,\n\n28:58.640 --> 29:03.640\n general information, vocabulary, digit span forward\n\n29:03.680 --> 29:06.760\n and digit span backward.\n\n29:06.760 --> 29:08.960\n Well, you said I can't even remember them.\n\n29:08.960 --> 29:10.480\n That's a good question for me.\n\n29:11.480 --> 29:13.600\n What does memory have to do with GFactor?\n\n29:13.600 --> 29:15.200\n Okay, well, let's hold on.\n\n29:15.200 --> 29:16.280\n Okay, all right.\n\n29:16.280 --> 29:19.720\n Let's just talk about these examples.\n\n29:19.720 --> 29:24.720\n Now, some of those items seem very cultural,\n\n29:26.760 --> 29:29.940\n and others seem less cultural.\n\n29:31.960 --> 29:35.400\n Which ones do you think, scores on which subtest\n\n29:35.400 --> 29:38.440\n are most highly correlated with the GFactor?\n\n29:39.640 --> 29:42.560\n Well, the intuitive answer is less cultural.\n\n29:42.560 --> 29:49.560\n Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated,\n\n29:49.860 --> 29:54.220\n and it turns out that digit span backwards\n\n29:54.220 --> 29:55.740\n is highly correlated.\n\n29:55.740 --> 29:58.620\n How do you figure?\n\n29:58.620 --> 30:03.300\n Now you have decades of research to answer the question,\n\n30:03.300 --> 30:04.580\n how do you figure?\n\n30:04.580 --> 30:08.980\n Right, so now there's good research that gives you\n\n30:08.980 --> 30:11.940\n intuition about what kind of questions get at it,\n\n30:11.940 --> 30:16.940\n just like there's something I've done,\n\n30:18.100 --> 30:21.980\n I've actually used for research in semi autonomous vehicle,\n\n30:21.980 --> 30:24.360\n like whether humans are paying attention,\n\n30:24.360 --> 30:28.460\n there's a body of literature that does end back test,\n\n30:28.460 --> 30:33.460\n for example, we have to put workload on the brain\n\n30:35.620 --> 30:38.900\n to do recall, memory recall, and that helps you\n\n30:38.900 --> 30:42.080\n kind of put some work onto the brain\n\n30:42.080 --> 30:44.260\n while the person is doing some other task,\n\n30:44.260 --> 30:46.800\n and does some interesting research with that.\n\n30:47.700 --> 30:48.940\n But that's loading the memory,\n\n30:48.940 --> 30:52.260\n so there's like research around stably\n\n30:52.260 --> 30:54.100\n what that means about the human mind,\n\n30:54.100 --> 30:57.100\n and here you're saying recall backwards\n\n30:58.420 --> 31:00.020\n is a good protector.\n\n31:00.020 --> 31:01.740\n It's a transformation.\n\n31:01.740 --> 31:04.140\n Yeah, so you have to do some,\n\n31:05.700 --> 31:07.820\n like you have to load that into your brain,\n\n31:07.820 --> 31:11.220\n and not just remember it, but do something with it.\n\n31:11.220 --> 31:14.460\n Right, here's another example of a different kind of test\n\n31:14.460 --> 31:18.360\n called the Hick paradigm, and it's not verbal at all.\n\n31:18.360 --> 31:23.140\n It's a little box, and there are a series of lights\n\n31:23.140 --> 31:26.580\n arranged in a semi circle at the top of the box,\n\n31:27.420 --> 31:31.300\n and then there's a home button that you press,\n\n31:31.300 --> 31:33.880\n and when one of the lights goes on,\n\n31:34.740 --> 31:37.780\n there's a button next to each of those lights,\n\n31:37.780 --> 31:39.940\n you take your finger off the home button,\n\n31:39.940 --> 31:41.980\n and you just press the button\n\n31:41.980 --> 31:44.100\n next to the light that goes on,\n\n31:44.100 --> 31:46.500\n and so it's a very simple reaction time.\n\n31:46.500 --> 31:49.220\n Light goes on, as quick as you can, you press the button,\n\n31:49.220 --> 31:50.540\n and you get a reaction time\n\n31:50.540 --> 31:53.700\n from the moment you lift your finger off the button\n\n31:53.700 --> 31:58.620\n to when you press the button where the light is.\n\n31:58.620 --> 32:02.160\n That reaction time doesn't really correlate\n\n32:02.160 --> 32:07.160\n with IQ very much, but if you change the instructions,\n\n32:07.160 --> 32:12.160\n and you say three lights are gonna come on simultaneously,\n\n32:13.120 --> 32:15.600\n I want you to press the button next to the light\n\n32:15.600 --> 32:17.840\n that's furthest from the other two.\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.260\n So maybe lights one and two go on,\n\n32:21.260 --> 32:24.320\n and light six goes on simultaneously.\n\n32:24.320 --> 32:25.560\n You take your finger off,\n\n32:25.560 --> 32:27.920\n and you would press the button by light six.\n\n32:28.880 --> 32:33.880\n That's that reaction time to a more complex task.\n\n32:34.360 --> 32:36.360\n It's not really hard.\n\n32:36.360 --> 32:38.360\n Almost everybody gets it all right,\n\n32:38.360 --> 32:41.040\n but your reaction time to that\n\n32:41.040 --> 32:43.760\n is highly correlated with the G factor.\n\n32:43.760 --> 32:45.040\n This is fascinating.\n\n32:45.040 --> 32:48.560\n So reaction time, so there's a temporal aspect to this.\n\n32:48.560 --> 32:50.040\n So what role does time?\n\n32:50.040 --> 32:50.880\n Speed of processing.\n\n32:50.880 --> 32:53.020\n It's the speed of processing.\n\n32:53.020 --> 32:55.740\n Is this also true for ones that take longer,\n\n32:55.740 --> 32:57.700\n like five, 10, 30 seconds?\n\n32:58.640 --> 33:01.200\n Is time part of the measure with some of these things?\n\n33:01.200 --> 33:05.640\n Yes, and that is why some of the best IQ tests\n\n33:05.640 --> 33:10.640\n have a time limit, because if you have no time limit,\n\n33:10.640 --> 33:12.960\n people can do better,\n\n33:12.960 --> 33:17.760\n but it doesn't distinguish among people that well.\n\n33:17.760 --> 33:21.440\n So that adding the time element is important.\n\n33:21.440 --> 33:24.120\n So speed of information processing,\n\n33:25.020 --> 33:26.680\n and reaction time is a measure\n\n33:26.680 --> 33:29.320\n of speed of information processing,\n\n33:29.320 --> 33:31.920\n turns out to be related to the G factor.\n\n33:31.920 --> 33:35.040\n But the G factor only accounts for maybe half\n\n33:35.040 --> 33:37.540\n or some amount on the test performance.\n\n33:37.540 --> 33:42.040\n For example, I get pretty bad test anxiety.\n\n33:42.040 --> 33:44.420\n Like I was never, I mean,\n\n33:46.280 --> 33:47.800\n I just don't enjoy tests.\n\n33:47.800 --> 33:51.280\n I enjoy going back into my cave and working.\n\n33:51.280 --> 33:55.180\n Like I've always enjoyed homework way more than tests,\n\n33:56.080 --> 33:57.800\n no matter how hard the homework is,\n\n33:57.800 --> 33:59.360\n because I can go back to the cave\n\n33:59.360 --> 34:00.760\n and hide away and think deeply.\n\n34:00.760 --> 34:02.700\n There's something about being watched\n\n34:02.700 --> 34:06.040\n and having a time limit that really makes me anxious,\n\n34:06.040 --> 34:10.200\n and I can just see the mind not operating optimally at all.\n\n34:10.200 --> 34:11.640\n But you're saying underneath there,\n\n34:11.640 --> 34:13.720\n there's still a G factor, there's still.\n\n34:13.720 --> 34:16.400\n No question, there's no question.\n\n34:16.400 --> 34:17.240\n Boy.\n\n34:17.240 --> 34:19.280\n And if you get anxious taking the test,\n\n34:19.280 --> 34:20.880\n many people say, oh, I didn't do well,\n\n34:20.880 --> 34:21.920\n because I'm anxious.\n\n34:23.560 --> 34:24.760\n I hear that a lot.\n\n34:24.760 --> 34:28.360\n Say, well, fine, if you're really anxious during the test,\n\n34:28.360 --> 34:32.040\n the score will be a bad estimate of your G factor.\n\n34:32.040 --> 34:34.040\n It doesn't mean the G factor isn't there.\n\n34:34.040 --> 34:34.880\n That's right.\n\n34:34.880 --> 34:39.120\n And by the way, standardized tests like the SAT,\n\n34:40.600 --> 34:43.060\n they're essentially intelligence tests.\n\n34:43.060 --> 34:45.240\n They are highly G loaded.\n\n34:45.240 --> 34:49.360\n Now, the people who make the SAT don't wanna mention that.\n\n34:50.680 --> 34:54.020\n They have enough trouble justifying standardized testing,\n\n34:54.020 --> 34:56.020\n but to call it an intelligence test\n\n34:56.020 --> 34:58.440\n is really beyond the pale.\n\n34:58.440 --> 35:00.720\n But in fact, it's so highly correlated,\n\n35:00.720 --> 35:03.200\n because it's a reasoning test.\n\n35:03.200 --> 35:04.880\n SAT is a reasoning test,\n\n35:04.880 --> 35:08.240\n a verbal reasoning, mathematical reasoning.\n\n35:08.240 --> 35:12.240\n And if it's a reasoning test, it has to be related to G.\n\n35:14.040 --> 35:17.560\n But if people go in and take a standardized test,\n\n35:17.560 --> 35:20.120\n whether it's an IQ test or the SAT,\n\n35:20.120 --> 35:24.600\n and they happen to be sick that day with 102 fever,\n\n35:24.600 --> 35:29.600\n the score is not going to be a good estimate of their G.\n\n35:29.600 --> 35:33.080\n If they retake the test when they're not anxious\n\n35:33.080 --> 35:35.720\n or less anxious or don't have a fever,\n\n35:36.640 --> 35:39.960\n the score will go up, and that will be a better estimate.\n\n35:39.960 --> 35:43.120\n But you can't say their G factor increased\n\n35:43.120 --> 35:45.160\n between the two tests.\n\n35:45.160 --> 35:46.480\n Well, it's interesting.\n\n35:46.480 --> 35:50.000\n So the question is how wide of a battery of tests\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:53.380\n is required to estimate the G factor well?\n\n35:53.380 --> 35:55.180\n Because I'll give you as my personal example,\n\n35:55.180 --> 35:58.720\n I took the SAT in, I think it was called the ACT,\n\n35:58.720 --> 36:02.880\n where I was two, also, I took SAT many times.\n\n36:02.880 --> 36:05.480\n Every single time, I got it perfect on math.\n\n36:05.480 --> 36:08.760\n And verbal, the time limit on the verbal\n\n36:08.760 --> 36:10.960\n made me very anxious.\n\n36:10.960 --> 36:12.480\n I did not, I mean, part of it,\n\n36:12.480 --> 36:14.200\n I didn't speak English very well.\n\n36:14.200 --> 36:17.440\n But honestly, it was like you're supposed to remember stuff,\n\n36:17.440 --> 36:18.760\n and I was so anxious.\n\n36:18.760 --> 36:21.640\n And as I'm reading, I'm sweating, I can't,\n\n36:21.640 --> 36:26.640\n you know that feeling you have when you're reading a book\n\n36:26.640 --> 36:30.100\n and you just read a page and you know nothing\n\n36:30.100 --> 36:32.600\n about what you've read because you zoned out.\n\n36:32.600 --> 36:36.440\n That's the same feeling of like, I can't, I have to,\n\n36:36.440 --> 36:39.480\n you're like, nope, read and understand.\n\n36:39.480 --> 36:43.080\n And that anxiety is like, and you start seeing\n\n36:43.080 --> 36:47.120\n like the typography versus the content of the words.\n\n36:47.120 --> 36:50.300\n Like that was, I don't, it's interesting\n\n36:50.300 --> 36:55.300\n because I know that what they're measuring,\n\n36:55.300 --> 36:58.780\n I could see being correlated with something.\n\n36:58.780 --> 37:02.840\n But that anxiety or some aspect of the performance\n\n37:04.660 --> 37:07.020\n sure plays a factor.\n\n37:07.020 --> 37:10.420\n And I wonder how you sneak up in a stable way.\n\n37:10.420 --> 37:11.900\n I mean, this is a broader discussion\n\n37:11.900 --> 37:16.580\n about like standardized testing, how you sneak up,\n\n37:16.580 --> 37:19.860\n how you get at the fact that I'm super anxious\n\n37:19.860 --> 37:22.260\n and still nevertheless measure some aspect\n\n37:22.260 --> 37:23.100\n of my ontology.\n\n37:23.100 --> 37:24.860\n I wonder, I don't know.\n\n37:24.860 --> 37:26.640\n I don't know if you can say to that,\n\n37:26.640 --> 37:28.540\n that time limit sure is a pain.\n\n37:28.540 --> 37:30.540\n Well, let me say this.\n\n37:30.540 --> 37:34.160\n There are two ways to approach the very real problem\n\n37:34.160 --> 37:36.880\n that you say that some people just get anxious\n\n37:36.880 --> 37:38.940\n or not good test takers.\n\n37:38.940 --> 37:43.940\n By the way, part of testing is you know the answer,\n\n37:45.620 --> 37:48.380\n you can figure out the answer or you can't.\n\n37:49.980 --> 37:52.900\n If you don't know the answer, there are many reasons\n\n37:52.900 --> 37:55.240\n you don't know the answer at that particular moment.\n\n37:55.240 --> 37:57.580\n You may have learned it once and forgotten it.\n\n37:58.460 --> 38:00.580\n It may be on the tip of your tongue\n\n38:00.580 --> 38:01.860\n and you just can't get it\n\n38:01.860 --> 38:03.820\n because you're anxious about the time limit.\n\n38:03.820 --> 38:05.860\n You may never have learned it.\n\n38:05.860 --> 38:08.660\n You may have been exposed to it,\n\n38:08.660 --> 38:11.420\n but it was too complicated and you couldn't learn it.\n\n38:11.420 --> 38:13.940\n I mean, there are all kinds of reasons here.\n\n38:13.940 --> 38:18.820\n But for an individual to interpret your scores\n\n38:18.820 --> 38:23.340\n as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score\n\n38:23.340 --> 38:26.260\n has to take into account various things\n\n38:26.260 --> 38:29.220\n that would affect your individual score.\n\n38:29.220 --> 38:32.740\n And that's why decisions about college admission\n\n38:32.740 --> 38:35.720\n or anything else where tests are used\n\n38:35.720 --> 38:40.720\n are hardly ever the only criterion to make a decision.\n\n38:42.340 --> 38:45.160\n And I think people are, college admissions\n\n38:45.160 --> 38:46.860\n letting go of that very much.\n\n38:46.860 --> 38:48.100\n Oh yes, yeah.\n\n38:48.100 --> 38:51.060\n But what does that even mean?\n\n38:51.060 --> 38:55.540\n Because is it possible to design standardized tests\n\n38:55.540 --> 38:58.420\n that do get, that are useful to college admissions?\n\n38:58.420 --> 38:59.740\n Well, they already exist.\n\n38:59.740 --> 39:03.820\n The SAT is highly correlated with many aspects\n\n39:03.820 --> 39:05.220\n of success at college.\n\n39:05.220 --> 39:06.380\n Here's the problem.\n\n39:06.380 --> 39:09.220\n So maybe you could speak to this.\n\n39:09.220 --> 39:13.360\n The correlation across the population versus individuals.\n\n39:13.360 --> 39:18.360\n So our criminal justice system is designed to make sure,\n\n39:23.420 --> 39:27.300\n wow, it's still, there's tragic cases\n\n39:27.300 --> 39:29.700\n where innocent people go to jail,\n\n39:29.700 --> 39:31.340\n but you try to avoid that.\n\n39:31.340 --> 39:34.460\n And the same way with testing,\n\n39:34.460 --> 39:38.780\n it just, it would suck for an SAT to miss genius.\n\n39:38.780 --> 39:43.260\n Yes, and it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely.\n\n39:43.260 --> 39:48.260\n So it really comes down to which piece of information\n\n39:51.980 --> 39:56.980\n maximizes your decision making ability.\n\n39:58.640 --> 40:03.640\n So if you just use high school grades, it's okay.\n\n40:05.300 --> 40:07.100\n But you will miss some people\n\n40:07.100 --> 40:09.140\n who just don't do well in high school,\n\n40:09.140 --> 40:11.340\n but who are actually pretty smart,\n\n40:11.340 --> 40:13.980\n smart enough to be bored silly in high school,\n\n40:13.980 --> 40:14.940\n and they don't care,\n\n40:14.940 --> 40:17.780\n and their high school GPA isn't that good.\n\n40:17.780 --> 40:21.380\n So you will miss them in the same sense\n\n40:21.380 --> 40:25.980\n that somebody who could be very able and ready for college\n\n40:25.980 --> 40:28.340\n just doesn't do well on their SAT.\n\n40:28.340 --> 40:31.660\n This is why you make decisions\n\n40:31.660 --> 40:36.140\n with taking in a variety of information.\n\n40:36.140 --> 40:38.080\n The other thing I wanted to say,\n\n40:38.080 --> 40:43.080\n I talked about when you make a decision for an individual,\n\n40:43.840 --> 40:46.720\n statistically for groups,\n\n40:46.720 --> 40:50.060\n there are many people who have a disparity\n\n40:50.060 --> 40:53.080\n between their math score and their verbal score.\n\n40:53.080 --> 40:55.640\n That disparity, or the other way around,\n\n40:55.640 --> 40:58.680\n that disparity is called tilt.\n\n40:58.680 --> 41:01.760\n The score is tilted one way or the other.\n\n41:01.760 --> 41:05.080\n And that tilt has been studied empirically\n\n41:05.080 --> 41:07.320\n to see what that predicts.\n\n41:07.320 --> 41:09.440\n And in fact, you can't make predictions\n\n41:09.440 --> 41:14.440\n about college success based on tilt.\n\n41:14.880 --> 41:16.760\n And mathematics is a good example.\n\n41:16.760 --> 41:18.320\n There are many people,\n\n41:18.320 --> 41:20.680\n especially non native speakers of English\n\n41:20.680 --> 41:22.360\n who come to this country,\n\n41:22.360 --> 41:24.940\n take the SATs, do very well on the math\n\n41:24.940 --> 41:26.840\n and not so well on the verbal.\n\n41:26.840 --> 41:31.220\n Well, if they're applying to a math program,\n\n41:31.220 --> 41:33.840\n the professors there who are making the decision\n\n41:33.840 --> 41:35.400\n or the admissions officers\n\n41:35.400 --> 41:39.600\n don't wait so much to score on verbal,\n\n41:39.600 --> 41:42.080\n especially if it's a non native speaker.\n\n41:42.080 --> 41:44.480\n Well, so yeah, you have to try to,\n\n41:44.480 --> 41:47.800\n in the admission process, bring in the context.\n\n41:47.800 --> 41:50.760\n But non native isn't really the problem.\n\n41:50.760 --> 41:53.720\n I mean, that was part of the problem for me.\n\n41:53.720 --> 41:57.980\n But it's the anxiety was, which it's interesting.\n\n41:57.980 --> 41:59.000\n It's interesting.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:04.000\n Oh boy, reducing yourself down to numbers.\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:07.880\n But it's still true.\n\n42:07.880 --> 42:09.240\n It's still the truth.\n\n42:09.240 --> 42:10.760\n It's a painful truth.\n\n42:10.760 --> 42:13.220\n That same anxiety that led me to be,\n\n42:16.080 --> 42:20.600\n to struggle with the SAT verbal tests\n\n42:20.600 --> 42:24.640\n is still within me in all ways of life.\n\n42:24.640 --> 42:26.880\n So maybe that's not anxiety.\n\n42:26.880 --> 42:30.600\n Maybe that's something, like personality\n\n42:30.600 --> 42:32.380\n is also pretty stable.\n\n42:32.380 --> 42:34.480\n Personality is stable.\n\n42:34.480 --> 42:39.480\n Personality does impact the way you navigate life.\n\n42:41.040 --> 42:42.460\n There's no question.\n\n42:42.460 --> 42:45.680\n Yeah, and we should say that the G factor in intelligence\n\n42:45.680 --> 42:50.400\n is not just about some kind of number on a paper.\n\n42:50.400 --> 42:53.940\n It also has to do with how you navigate life.\n\n42:53.940 --> 42:58.940\n How easy life is for you in this very complicated world.\n\n43:00.880 --> 43:02.880\n So personality's all tied into that\n\n43:02.880 --> 43:05.880\n in some deep fundamental way.\n\n43:05.880 --> 43:07.720\n But now you've hit the key point\n\n43:07.720 --> 43:11.320\n about why we even want to study intelligence.\n\n43:11.320 --> 43:13.360\n And personality, I think, to a lesser extent.\n\n43:13.360 --> 43:17.480\n But that's my interest, is more on intelligence.\n\n43:17.480 --> 43:20.140\n I went to graduate school and wanted to study personality,\n\n43:20.140 --> 43:22.640\n but that's kind of another story\n\n43:22.640 --> 43:25.240\n how I got kind of shifted from personality research\n\n43:25.240 --> 43:27.440\n over to intelligence research.\n\n43:27.440 --> 43:30.040\n Because it's not just a number.\n\n43:30.040 --> 43:32.560\n Intelligence is not just an IQ score.\n\n43:32.560 --> 43:34.740\n It's not just an SAT score.\n\n43:34.740 --> 43:39.740\n It's what those numbers reflect about your ability\n\n43:39.740 --> 43:42.140\n to navigate everyday life.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:48.000\n It has been said that life is one long intelligence test.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:53.000\n And who can't relate to that?\n\n43:55.400 --> 43:58.440\n And if you doubt, see, another problem here\n\n43:58.440 --> 44:00.800\n is a lot of critics of intelligence research,\n\n44:00.800 --> 44:04.000\n intelligence testing, tend to be academics\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.240\n who, by and large, are pretty smart people.\n\n44:07.240 --> 44:10.040\n And pretty smart people, by and large,\n\n44:10.040 --> 44:12.900\n have enormous difficulty understanding\n\n44:12.900 --> 44:17.900\n what the world is like for people with IQs of 80 or 75.\n\n44:18.960 --> 44:23.040\n It is a completely different everyday experience.\n\n44:23.040 --> 44:27.900\n Even IQ scores of 85, 90.\n\n44:27.900 --> 44:32.040\n You know, there's a popular television program, Judge Judy.\n\n44:32.040 --> 44:35.340\n Judge Judy deals with everyday people\n\n44:35.340 --> 44:39.440\n with everyday problems, and you can see the full range\n\n44:39.440 --> 44:43.240\n of problem solving ability demonstrated there.\n\n44:43.240 --> 44:45.300\n And sometimes she does it for laughs,\n\n44:45.300 --> 44:50.300\n but it really isn't funny because people who are,\n\n44:52.460 --> 44:54.500\n there are people who are very limited\n\n44:54.500 --> 44:59.160\n in their life navigation, let alone success,\n\n45:00.040 --> 45:05.040\n by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot be taught.\n\n45:05.040 --> 45:07.720\n We know this, by the way, because there are many efforts.\n\n45:07.720 --> 45:09.320\n You know, the United States military,\n\n45:09.320 --> 45:12.160\n which excels at training people,\n\n45:12.160 --> 45:14.560\n I mean, I don't know that there's a better organization\n\n45:14.560 --> 45:18.360\n in the world for training diverse people,\n\n45:18.360 --> 45:20.760\n and they won't take people with IQs under,\n\n45:20.760 --> 45:24.960\n I think, 83 is the cutoff, because they have found\n\n45:24.960 --> 45:29.960\n they are unable to train people with lower IQs\n\n45:30.520 --> 45:32.520\n to do jobs in the military.\n\n45:32.520 --> 45:35.720\n So one of the things that G Factor has to do is learning.\n\n45:35.720 --> 45:40.720\n Absolutely, some people learn faster than others.\n\n45:40.720 --> 45:43.520\n Some people learn more than others.\n\n45:43.520 --> 45:46.320\n Now, faster, by the way, is not necessarily better,\n\n45:47.320 --> 45:49.920\n as long as you get to the same place eventually.\n\n45:51.720 --> 45:54.320\n But, you know, there are professional schools\n\n45:54.320 --> 45:57.640\n that want students who can learn the fastest\n\n45:57.640 --> 46:01.520\n because they can learn more or learn better.\n\n46:01.520 --> 46:06.520\n Or learn deeper, or all kinds of ideas\n\n46:06.880 --> 46:09.560\n about why you select people with the highest scores.\n\n46:09.560 --> 46:12.640\n And there's nothing funnier, by the way,\n\n46:12.640 --> 46:15.120\n to listen to a bunch of academics\n\n46:15.120 --> 46:17.680\n complain about the concept of intelligence\n\n46:17.680 --> 46:20.120\n and intelligence testing, and then you go\n\n46:20.120 --> 46:22.480\n to a faculty meeting where they're discussing\n\n46:22.480 --> 46:24.760\n who to hire among the applicants.\n\n46:24.760 --> 46:27.320\n And all they talk about is how smart the person is.\n\n46:28.400 --> 46:31.200\n We'll get to that, we'll sneak up to that in different ways,\n\n46:31.200 --> 46:33.000\n but there's something about reducing a person\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.280\n to a number that in part is grounded\n\n46:35.280 --> 46:38.800\n to the person's genetics that makes people very uncomfortable.\n\n46:38.800 --> 46:40.480\n But nobody does that.\n\n46:40.480 --> 46:43.760\n Nobody in the field actually does that.\n\n46:43.760 --> 46:48.760\n That is a worry that is a worry like,\n\n46:54.040 --> 46:55.880\n well, I don't wanna call it a conspiracy theory.\n\n46:55.880 --> 46:58.360\n I mean, it's a legitimate worry,\n\n46:58.360 --> 47:01.400\n but it just doesn't happen.\n\n47:01.400 --> 47:03.600\n Now, I had a professor in graduate school\n\n47:03.600 --> 47:05.880\n who was the only person I ever knew\n\n47:05.880 --> 47:10.880\n who considered the students only by their test scores.\n\n47:12.680 --> 47:16.360\n And later in his life, he kind of backed off that.\n\n47:19.480 --> 47:21.560\n Let me ask you this, so we'll jump around,\n\n47:21.560 --> 47:26.560\n I'll come back to it, but I tend to,\n\n47:26.560 --> 47:29.520\n I've had like political discussions with people\n\n47:29.520 --> 47:34.520\n and actually my friend Michael Malice, he's an anarchist.\n\n47:36.240 --> 47:39.200\n I disagree with him on basically everything\n\n47:39.200 --> 47:44.200\n except the fact that love is a beautiful thing in this world.\n\n47:47.360 --> 47:50.600\n And he says this test about left versus right,\n\n47:50.600 --> 47:52.280\n whatever, it doesn't matter what the test is,\n\n47:52.280 --> 47:54.920\n but he believes, the question is,\n\n47:54.920 --> 47:57.900\n do you believe that some people are better than others?\n\n48:00.360 --> 48:03.880\n Question is ambiguous.\n\n48:03.880 --> 48:06.120\n Do you believe some people are better than others?\n\n48:06.120 --> 48:10.720\n And to me, sort of the immediate answer is no.\n\n48:11.720 --> 48:15.680\n It's a poetic question, it's an ambiguous question, right?\n\n48:15.680 --> 48:19.520\n Like people wanna maybe the temptation\n\n48:19.520 --> 48:23.440\n to ask better at what, better at like sports and so on.\n\n48:23.440 --> 48:28.440\n No, to me, I stand with the sort of defining documents\n\n48:28.440 --> 48:32.280\n of this country, which is all men are created equal.\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:34.320\n There's a basic humanity.\n\n48:34.320 --> 48:39.320\n And there's something about tests of intelligence.\n\n48:39.840 --> 48:43.380\n Just knowing that some people are different,\n\n48:43.380 --> 48:45.400\n like the science of intelligence that shows\n\n48:45.400 --> 48:47.380\n that some people are genetically\n\n48:49.200 --> 48:52.400\n in some stable way across a lifetime,\n\n48:52.400 --> 48:56.160\n have a greater intelligence than others,\n\n48:56.160 --> 49:01.160\n makes people feel like some people are better than others.\n\n49:01.200 --> 49:03.600\n And that makes them very uncomfortable.\n\n49:03.600 --> 49:06.960\n And I, maybe you can speak to that.\n\n49:06.960 --> 49:09.560\n The fact that some people are more intelligent than others\n\n49:09.560 --> 49:14.560\n in a way that's, cannot be compensated\n\n49:14.560 --> 49:19.560\n through education, through anything you do in life.\n\n49:22.600 --> 49:24.480\n What do we do with that?\n\n49:24.480 --> 49:25.900\n Okay, there's a lot there.\n\n49:26.800 --> 49:29.960\n We haven't really talked about the genetics of it yet.\n\n49:29.960 --> 49:34.960\n But you are correct in that it is my interpretation\n\n49:35.240 --> 49:39.720\n of the data that genetics has a very important influence\n\n49:39.720 --> 49:41.380\n on the G factor.\n\n49:41.380 --> 49:44.440\n And this is controversial, and we can talk about it,\n\n49:44.440 --> 49:47.040\n but if you think that genetics,\n\n49:47.040 --> 49:50.800\n that genes are deterministic, are always deterministic,\n\n49:50.800 --> 49:54.080\n that leads to kind of the worry that you expressed.\n\n49:55.320 --> 49:58.600\n But we know now in the 21st century\n\n49:58.600 --> 50:00.920\n that many genes are not deterministic,\n\n50:00.920 --> 50:02.800\n that are probabilistic,\n\n50:02.800 --> 50:07.800\n meaning their gene expression can be influenced.\n\n50:09.880 --> 50:11.320\n Now, whether they're influenced only\n\n50:11.320 --> 50:16.320\n by other biological variables or other genetic variables\n\n50:16.440 --> 50:19.160\n or environmental or cultural variables,\n\n50:19.160 --> 50:21.760\n that's where the controversy comes in.\n\n50:23.040 --> 50:27.200\n And we can discuss that in more detail if you like.\n\n50:27.200 --> 50:31.700\n But to go to the question about better, are people better?\n\n50:31.700 --> 50:36.700\n There's zero evidence that smart people are better\n\n50:36.700 --> 50:41.700\n with respect to important aspects of life,\n\n50:43.300 --> 50:47.460\n like honesty, even likability.\n\n50:47.460 --> 50:50.340\n I'm sure you know many very intelligent people\n\n50:50.340 --> 50:53.420\n who are not terribly likable or terribly kind\n\n50:53.420 --> 50:55.480\n or terribly honest.\n\n50:55.480 --> 50:56.760\n Is there something to be said?\n\n50:56.760 --> 50:59.820\n So one of the things I've recently reread\n\n50:59.820 --> 51:03.860\n for the second time, I guess that's what the word reread\n\n51:03.860 --> 51:08.860\n means, the rise and fall of the Third Reich,\n\n51:08.980 --> 51:12.060\n which is, I think, the best telling\n\n51:12.060 --> 51:14.700\n of the rise and fall of Hitler.\n\n51:14.700 --> 51:18.640\n And one of the interesting things about the people that,\n\n51:20.900 --> 51:22.160\n how should I say it?\n\n51:27.260 --> 51:32.260\n Justified or maybe propped up the ideas\n\n51:32.260 --> 51:35.940\n that Hitler put forward is the fact\n\n51:35.940 --> 51:38.460\n that they were extremely intelligent.\n\n51:38.460 --> 51:40.600\n They were the intellectual class.\n\n51:41.780 --> 51:46.260\n They were like, it was obvious that they thought\n\n51:46.260 --> 51:49.540\n very deeply and rationally about the world.\n\n51:49.540 --> 51:52.660\n So what I would like to say is one of the things\n\n51:52.660 --> 51:56.100\n that shows to me is some of the worst atrocities\n\n51:56.100 --> 51:58.860\n in the history of humanity have been committed\n\n51:58.860 --> 52:00.780\n by very intelligent people.\n\n52:00.780 --> 52:04.620\n So that means that intelligence\n\n52:04.620 --> 52:06.420\n doesn't make you a good person.\n\n52:06.420 --> 52:11.420\n I wonder if there's a G factor for intelligence.\n\n52:12.820 --> 52:15.260\n I wonder if there's a G factor for goodness.\n\n52:16.860 --> 52:19.180\n The Nietzschean good and evil,\n\n52:19.180 --> 52:21.740\n of course that's probably harder to measure\n\n52:21.740 --> 52:23.240\n because it's such a subjective thing\n\n52:23.240 --> 52:25.340\n what it means to be good.\n\n52:25.340 --> 52:29.380\n And even the idea of evil is a deeply uncomfortable thing\n\n52:29.380 --> 52:31.340\n because how do we know?\n\n52:31.340 --> 52:33.500\n But it's independent, whatever it is,\n\n52:33.500 --> 52:35.900\n it's independent of intelligence.\n\n52:35.900 --> 52:37.980\n So I agree with you about that.\n\n52:37.980 --> 52:39.340\n But let me say this.\n\n52:39.340 --> 52:44.100\n I have also asserted my belief\n\n52:44.100 --> 52:47.240\n that more intelligence is better than less.\n\n52:49.220 --> 52:54.220\n That doesn't mean more intelligent people are better people\n\n52:54.400 --> 52:55.860\n but all things being equal,\n\n52:55.860 --> 52:58.740\n would you like to be smarter or less smart?\n\n52:58.740 --> 53:01.260\n So if I had a pill, I have two pills.\n\n53:01.260 --> 53:02.880\n I said, this one will make you smarter,\n\n53:02.880 --> 53:04.500\n this one will make you dumber.\n\n53:04.500 --> 53:06.460\n Which one would you like?\n\n53:06.460 --> 53:07.940\n Are there any circumstances\n\n53:07.940 --> 53:09.860\n under which you would choose to be dumber?\n\n53:09.860 --> 53:11.560\n Well, let me ask you this.\n\n53:11.560 --> 53:13.960\n That's a very nuanced and interesting question.\n\n53:16.040 --> 53:18.380\n There's been books written about this, right?\n\n53:19.680 --> 53:21.680\n Now we'll return to the hard questions,\n\n53:21.680 --> 53:22.760\n the interesting questions,\n\n53:22.760 --> 53:25.780\n but let me ask about human happiness.\n\n53:25.780 --> 53:29.180\n Does intelligence lead to happiness?\n\n53:29.180 --> 53:30.020\n No.\n\n53:31.820 --> 53:34.980\n So, okay, so back to the pill then.\n\n53:34.980 --> 53:38.980\n So when would you take the pill?\n\n53:38.980 --> 53:43.980\n So you said IQ 80, 90, 100, 110,\n\n53:44.860 --> 53:46.580\n you start going through the quartiles\n\n53:46.580 --> 53:50.220\n and is it obvious?\n\n53:50.220 --> 53:54.500\n Isn't there diminishing returns\n\n53:54.500 --> 53:56.500\n and then it starts becoming negative?\n\n53:57.420 --> 53:59.280\n This is an empirical question.\n\n54:00.420 --> 54:05.420\n And so that I have advocated in many forums\n\n54:06.160 --> 54:11.160\n more research on enhancing the G factor.\n\n54:11.820 --> 54:14.420\n Right now there have been many claims\n\n54:14.420 --> 54:17.320\n about enhancing intelligence with,\n\n54:17.320 --> 54:19.100\n you mentioned the NBAC training,\n\n54:19.100 --> 54:22.640\n it was a big deal a few years ago, it doesn't work.\n\n54:22.640 --> 54:25.740\n Data is very clear, it does not work.\n\n54:25.740 --> 54:28.580\n Or doing like memory tests, like training and so on.\n\n54:28.580 --> 54:32.700\n Yeah, it may give you a better memory in the short run,\n\n54:32.700 --> 54:35.440\n but it doesn't impact your G factor.\n\n54:38.140 --> 54:40.940\n It was very popular a couple of decades ago\n\n54:40.940 --> 54:44.560\n that the idea that listening to Mozart\n\n54:44.560 --> 54:46.580\n could make you more intelligent.\n\n54:46.580 --> 54:48.180\n There was a paper published on this\n\n54:48.180 --> 54:50.300\n with somebody I knew published this paper,\n\n54:50.300 --> 54:54.660\n and intelligence researchers never believed it for a second.\n\n54:54.660 --> 54:57.820\n Been hundreds of studies, all the meta analyses,\n\n54:57.820 --> 54:59.420\n all the summaries and so on,\n\n54:59.420 --> 55:04.080\n show that there's nothing to it, nothing to it at all.\n\n55:05.900 --> 55:08.780\n But wouldn't it be something,\n\n55:08.780 --> 55:11.840\n wouldn't it be world shaking\n\n55:12.820 --> 55:15.940\n if you could take the normal distribution of intelligence,\n\n55:15.940 --> 55:17.500\n which we haven't really talked about yet,\n\n55:17.500 --> 55:20.400\n but IQ scores and the G factor\n\n55:20.400 --> 55:22.760\n is thought to be a normal distribution,\n\n55:23.940 --> 55:28.940\n and shift it to the right so that everybody is smarter?\n\n55:30.140 --> 55:34.400\n Even a half a standard deviation would be world shaking,\n\n55:35.340 --> 55:38.700\n because there are many social problems,\n\n55:38.700 --> 55:43.260\n many, many social problems that are exacerbated\n\n55:43.260 --> 55:48.260\n by people with lower ability to reason stuff out\n\n55:48.700 --> 55:50.620\n and navigate everyday life.\n\n55:51.860 --> 55:52.700\n So.\n\n55:52.700 --> 55:53.780\n I wonder if there's a threshold.\n\n55:53.780 --> 55:58.780\n So maybe I would push back and say universal shifting\n\n55:59.420 --> 56:02.240\n of the normal distribution\n\n56:02.240 --> 56:05.060\n may not be the optimal way of shifting.\n\n56:05.060 --> 56:07.340\n Maybe it's better to,\n\n56:07.340 --> 56:10.620\n whatever the asymmetric kind of distributions\n\n56:10.620 --> 56:13.380\n is like really pushing the lower up\n\n56:13.380 --> 56:17.580\n versus trying to make the people\n\n56:17.580 --> 56:19.660\n at the average more intelligent.\n\n56:19.660 --> 56:21.060\n So you're saying that if in fact\n\n56:21.060 --> 56:23.540\n there was some way to increase G,\n\n56:23.540 --> 56:27.800\n let's just call it metaphorically a pill, an IQ pill,\n\n56:27.800 --> 56:30.580\n we should only give it to people at the lower end.\n\n56:30.580 --> 56:34.940\n No, it's just intuitively I can see\n\n56:34.940 --> 56:39.820\n that life becomes easier at the lower end if it's increased.\n\n56:39.820 --> 56:41.820\n It becomes less and less,\n\n56:41.820 --> 56:43.580\n it is an empirical scientific question,\n\n56:43.580 --> 56:46.180\n but it becomes less and less obvious to me\n\n56:46.180 --> 56:50.500\n that more intelligence is better.\n\n56:50.500 --> 56:55.500\n At the high end, not because it would make life easier,\n\n56:56.500 --> 57:00.980\n but it would make whatever problems you're working on\n\n57:00.980 --> 57:02.700\n more solvable.\n\n57:02.700 --> 57:06.740\n And if you are working on artificial intelligence,\n\n57:06.740 --> 57:11.740\n there's a tremendous potential for that to improve society.\n\n57:13.300 --> 57:14.580\n I understand.\n\n57:14.580 --> 57:19.000\n So at whatever problems you're working on, yes.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.720\n But there's also the problem of the human condition.\n\n57:21.720 --> 57:24.340\n There's love, there's fear,\n\n57:24.340 --> 57:26.700\n and all of those beautiful things\n\n57:26.700 --> 57:29.860\n that sometimes if you're good at solving problems,\n\n57:29.860 --> 57:32.100\n you're going to create more problems for yourself.\n\n57:32.100 --> 57:34.460\n It's, I'm not exactly sure.\n\n57:34.460 --> 57:37.220\n So ignorance is bliss is a thing.\n\n57:37.220 --> 57:38.400\n So there might be a place,\n\n57:38.400 --> 57:40.960\n there might be a sweet spot of intelligence\n\n57:40.960 --> 57:43.680\n given your environment, given your personality,\n\n57:43.680 --> 57:45.060\n all of those kinds of things.\n\n57:45.060 --> 57:48.140\n And that becomes less beautifully complicated\n\n57:48.140 --> 57:50.500\n the more and more intelligent you become.\n\n57:50.500 --> 57:53.160\n But that's a question for literature,\n\n57:53.160 --> 57:54.700\n not for science perhaps.\n\n57:54.700 --> 57:56.180\n Well, imagine this.\n\n57:56.180 --> 57:58.380\n Imagine there was an IQ pill\n\n57:58.380 --> 58:01.580\n and it was developed by a private company\n\n58:01.580 --> 58:05.060\n and they are willing to sell it to you.\n\n58:05.060 --> 58:07.900\n And whatever price they put on it,\n\n58:07.900 --> 58:09.500\n you are willing to pay it\n\n58:09.500 --> 58:11.780\n because you would like to be smarter.\n\n58:11.780 --> 58:14.360\n But just before they give you a pill,\n\n58:14.360 --> 58:18.380\n they give you a disclaimer form to sign.\n\n58:18.380 --> 58:20.020\n Yes.\n\n58:20.020 --> 58:21.060\n Don't hold us,\n\n58:22.620 --> 58:25.180\n you understand that this pill has no guarantee\n\n58:25.180 --> 58:26.980\n that your life is going to be better\n\n58:26.980 --> 58:28.920\n and in fact it could be worse.\n\n58:28.920 --> 58:32.200\n Well, yes, that's how lawyers work.\n\n58:32.200 --> 58:35.160\n But I would love for science to answer the question\n\n58:35.160 --> 58:36.640\n to try to predict if your life\n\n58:36.640 --> 58:38.680\n is going to be better or worse\n\n58:38.680 --> 58:41.200\n when you become more or less intelligent.\n\n58:41.200 --> 58:43.260\n It's a fascinating question\n\n58:43.260 --> 58:45.920\n about what is the sweet spot for the human condition.\n\n58:47.600 --> 58:49.820\n Some of the things we see as bugs\n\n58:49.820 --> 58:51.900\n might be actually features,\n\n58:51.900 --> 58:55.360\n may be crucial to our overall happiness\n\n58:55.360 --> 58:59.120\n as our limitations might lead to more happiness than less.\n\n58:59.120 --> 59:02.720\n But again, more intelligence is better at the lower end.\n\n59:02.720 --> 59:06.480\n That's more, that's something that's less arguable\n\n59:06.480 --> 59:10.080\n and fascinating if possible to increase.\n\n59:10.080 --> 59:12.960\n But you know, there's virtually no research\n\n59:12.960 --> 59:15.320\n that's based on a neuroscience approach\n\n59:15.320 --> 59:17.520\n to solving that problem.\n\n59:17.520 --> 59:20.800\n All the solutions that have been proposed\n\n59:20.800 --> 59:25.400\n to solve that problem or to ameliorate that problem\n\n59:25.400 --> 59:29.680\n are essentially based on the blank slate assumption\n\n59:29.680 --> 59:34.680\n that enriching the environment, removing barriers,\n\n59:34.680 --> 59:36.000\n all good things by the way,\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.160\n I'm not against any of those things.\n\n59:38.160 --> 59:39.700\n But there's no empirical evidence\n\n59:39.700 --> 59:44.360\n that they're going to improve the general reasoning ability\n\n59:45.260 --> 59:47.920\n or make people more employable.\n\n59:47.920 --> 59:50.680\n Have you read Flowers of Algernon? Yes.\n\n59:51.840 --> 59:54.680\n That's to the question of intelligence and happiness.\n\n59:56.240 --> 59:59.440\n There are many profound aspects of that story.\n\n59:59.440 --> 1:00:01.840\n It was a film that was very good.\n\n1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:04.800\n The film was called Charlie\n\n1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:07.500\n for the younger people who are listening to this.\n\n1:00:08.680 --> 1:00:11.780\n You might be able to stream it on Netflix or something,\n\n1:00:11.780 --> 1:00:16.780\n but it was a story about a person\n\n1:00:16.780 --> 1:00:20.620\n with very low IQ who underwent a surgical procedure\n\n1:00:20.620 --> 1:00:23.780\n in the brain and he slowly became a genius.\n\n1:00:24.860 --> 1:00:29.480\n And the tragedy of the story is the effect was temporary.\n\n1:00:31.180 --> 1:00:33.120\n It's a fascinating story really.\n\n1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:36.580\n That goes in contrast to the basic human experience\n\n1:00:36.580 --> 1:00:38.420\n that each of us individually have,\n\n1:00:38.420 --> 1:00:43.420\n but it raises the question of the full range of people\n\n1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:47.700\n you might be able to be given different levels\n\n1:00:47.700 --> 1:00:48.780\n of intelligence.\n\n1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:51.920\n You've mentioned the normal distribution.\n\n1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:54.520\n So let's talk about it.\n\n1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:58.360\n There's a book called The Bell Curve written in 1994,\n\n1:00:58.360 --> 1:01:01.340\n written by psychologist Richard Herrnstein\n\n1:01:01.340 --> 1:01:04.500\n and political scientist Charles Murray.\n\n1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:07.140\n Why was this book so controversial?\n\n1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:10.720\n This is a fascinating book.\n\n1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:12.620\n I know Charles Murray.\n\n1:01:12.620 --> 1:01:15.340\n I've had many conversations with him.\n\n1:01:15.340 --> 1:01:16.660\n Yeah, what is the book about?\n\n1:01:16.660 --> 1:01:21.660\n The book is about the importance of intelligence\n\n1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:24.160\n in everyday life.\n\n1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:27.520\n That's what the book is about.\n\n1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:29.220\n It's an empirical book.\n\n1:01:29.220 --> 1:01:34.180\n It has statistical analyses of very large databases\n\n1:01:34.180 --> 1:01:39.180\n that show that essentially IQ scores or their equivalent\n\n1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:44.180\n are correlated to all kinds of social problems\n\n1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:46.800\n and social benefits.\n\n1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:51.740\n And that in itself is not where the controversy\n\n1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:53.640\n about that book came.\n\n1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:57.600\n The controversy was about one chapter in that book.\n\n1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:02.240\n And that is a chapter about the average difference\n\n1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:06.720\n in mean scores between black Americans and white Americans.\n\n1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:08.960\n And these are the terms that were used in the book\n\n1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:12.260\n at the time and are still used to some extent.\n\n1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:19.080\n And historically, or really for decades,\n\n1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:26.240\n it has been observed that disadvantaged groups\n\n1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:32.920\n score on average lower than Caucasians\n\n1:02:35.480 --> 1:02:38.280\n on academic tests, tests of mental ability,\n\n1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:40.440\n and especially on IQ tests.\n\n1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:43.120\n And the difference is about a standard deviation,\n\n1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:46.620\n which is about 15 points, which is a substantial difference.\n\n1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:53.920\n In the book, Herrnstein and Murray in this one chapter\n\n1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:58.260\n assert clearly and unambiguously\n\n1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:01.960\n that whether this average difference\n\n1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:06.960\n is due to genetics or not, they are agnostic.\n\n1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:08.280\n They don't know.\n\n1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:11.160\n Moreover, they assert they don't care\n\n1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:13.880\n because you wouldn't treat anybody differently\n\n1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:17.640\n knowing if there was a genetic component or not\n\n1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:20.560\n because that's a group average finding.\n\n1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:23.960\n Every individual has to be treated as an individual.\n\n1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:26.040\n You can't make any assumption\n\n1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:30.640\n about what that person's intellectual ability might be\n\n1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.160\n from the fact of a average group difference.\n\n1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:34.880\n They're very clear about this.\n\n1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:39.880\n Nonetheless, people took away,\n\n1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:43.240\n I'm gonna choose my words carefully\n\n1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:44.800\n because I have a feeling that many critics\n\n1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:49.160\n didn't actually read the book.\n\n1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:51.880\n They took away that Herrnstein and Murray were saying\n\n1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:54.960\n that blacks are genetically inferior.\n\n1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:56.560\n That was the take home message.\n\n1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:59.680\n And if they weren't saying it, they were implying it\n\n1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:02.720\n because they had a chapter that discussed\n\n1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:05.940\n this empirical observation of a difference.\n\n1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:10.560\n And isn't this horrible?\n\n1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:15.080\n And so the reaction to that book was incendiary.\n\n1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:22.560\n What do we know about from that book\n\n1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:27.560\n and the research beyond about race differences\n\n1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:30.620\n and intelligence?\n\n1:04:30.620 --> 1:04:33.800\n It's still the most incendiary topic in psychology.\n\n1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:35.880\n Nothing has changed that.\n\n1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:40.880\n Anybody who even discusses it is easily called a racist\n\n1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:43.040\n just for discussing it.\n\n1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:45.560\n It's become fashionable to find racism\n\n1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:49.960\n in any discussion like this.\n\n1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:51.340\n It's unfortunate.\n\n1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:56.040\n The short answer to your question is\n\n1:04:57.080 --> 1:05:00.160\n there's been very little actual research\n\n1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:03.840\n on this topic since 19...\n\n1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:05.200\n Since the bell curve.\n\n1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:07.920\n Since the bell curve, even before.\n\n1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:12.460\n This really became incendiary in 1969\n\n1:05:12.460 --> 1:05:15.760\n with an article published by an educational psychologist\n\n1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:17.760\n named Arthur Jensen.\n\n1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:20.520\n Let's just take a minute and go back to that\n\n1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:22.920\n to see the bell curve in a little bit more\n\n1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:25.040\n historical perspective.\n\n1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:28.160\n Arthur Jensen was a educational psychologist\n\n1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:29.320\n at UC Berkeley.\n\n1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:31.440\n I knew him as well.\n\n1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:36.440\n And in 1969 or 68, the Harvard Educational Review\n\n1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:42.640\n asked him to do a review article\n\n1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:47.560\n on the early childhood education programs\n\n1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:52.560\n that were designed to raise the IQs of minority students.\n\n1:05:54.800 --> 1:05:58.560\n This was before the federally funded Head Start program.\n\n1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:01.280\n Head Start had not really gotten underway\n\n1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:04.440\n at the time Jensen undertook his review\n\n1:06:04.440 --> 1:06:07.780\n of what were a number of demonstration programs.\n\n1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:13.640\n And these demonstration programs were for young children\n\n1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:15.720\n who were around kindergarten age.\n\n1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:18.200\n And they were specially designed to be\n\n1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:23.020\n cognitively stimulating, to provide lunches,\n\n1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:27.200\n do all the things that people thought would\n\n1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:31.800\n minimize this average gap of intelligence tests.\n\n1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:36.800\n There was a strong belief among virtually all psychologists\n\n1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:40.760\n that the cause of the gap was unequal opportunity\n\n1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:45.600\n due to racism, due to all negative things in the society.\n\n1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:50.600\n And if you could compensate for this, the gap would go away.\n\n1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:54.740\n So early childhood education back then was called\n\n1:06:54.740 --> 1:06:57.280\n literally compensatory education.\n\n1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:00.920\n Jensen looked at these programs.\n\n1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:02.200\n He was an empirical guy.\n\n1:07:02.200 --> 1:07:04.600\n He understood psychometrics.\n\n1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:08.800\n And he wrote a, it was over a hundred page article\n\n1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:12.120\n detailing these programs\n\n1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:15.360\n and the flaws in their research design.\n\n1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:17.640\n Some of the programs reported IQ gains\n\n1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:20.400\n of on average five points,\n\n1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:24.720\n but a few reported 10, 20 and even 30 point gains.\n\n1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:28.000\n One was called the miracle in Milwaukee.\n\n1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.440\n That investigator went to jail ultimately\n\n1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:32.100\n for fabricating data.\n\n1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:36.000\n But the point is that Jensen wrote an article that said,\n\n1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000\n look, the opening sentence of his article is classic.\n\n1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:43.520\n The opening sentence is, I may not quote it exactly right,\n\n1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:47.120\n but it's, we have tried compensatory education\n\n1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:48.420\n and it has failed.\n\n1:07:48.420 --> 1:07:53.420\n And he showed that these gains were essentially nothing.\n\n1:07:54.140 --> 1:07:58.660\n You couldn't really document empirically any gains at all\n\n1:07:58.660 --> 1:08:03.340\n from these really earnest efforts to increase IQ.\n\n1:08:03.340 --> 1:08:08.060\n But he went a step further, a fateful step further.\n\n1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:11.740\n He said, not only have these efforts failed,\n\n1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:15.220\n but because they have had essentially no impact,\n\n1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:17.660\n we have to reexamine our assumption\n\n1:08:17.660 --> 1:08:22.100\n that these differences are caused by environmental things\n\n1:08:22.100 --> 1:08:24.420\n that we can address with education.\n\n1:08:24.420 --> 1:08:28.500\n We need to consider a genetic influence,\n\n1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:30.580\n whether there's a genetic influence\n\n1:08:30.580 --> 1:08:32.420\n on this group difference.\n\n1:08:32.420 --> 1:08:36.060\n So you said that this is one of the more controversial works\n\n1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:37.900\n ever in science. I think it's the most infamous paper\n\n1:08:37.900 --> 1:08:41.680\n in all of psychology, I would go on to say.\n\n1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:46.680\n Because in 1969, the genetic data was very skimpy\n\n1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:49.640\n on this question, skimpy and controversial.\n\n1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:50.820\n It's always been controversial,\n\n1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:53.820\n but it was even skimpy and controversial.\n\n1:08:53.820 --> 1:08:56.480\n It's kind of a long story that I go into a little bit\n\n1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:00.900\n in more detail in the book, Neuroscience of Intelligence.\n\n1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:06.320\n But to say he was vilified is an understatement.\n\n1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:08.880\n I mean, he couldn't talk at the American\n\n1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:13.140\n Psychological Association without bomb threats\n\n1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:15.240\n clearing the lecture hall.\n\n1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:18.120\n Campus security watched him all the time.\n\n1:09:18.120 --> 1:09:19.420\n They opened his mail.\n\n1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:23.720\n He had to retreat to a different address.\n\n1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:28.760\n This was one of the earliest kinds,\n\n1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:30.500\n this is before the internet\n\n1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:35.080\n and kind of internet social media mobs.\n\n1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:38.120\n But it was that intense.\n\n1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:42.740\n And I have written that overnight,\n\n1:09:42.740 --> 1:09:45.960\n after the publication of this article,\n\n1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:49.760\n all intelligence research became radioactive.\n\n1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:51.820\n Nobody wanted to talk about it.\n\n1:09:56.200 --> 1:09:58.920\n Nobody was doing more research.\n\n1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:02.080\n And then the bell curve came along.\n\n1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:05.720\n And the Jensen controversy was dying down.\n\n1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:08.960\n I have stories that Jensen told me about his interaction\n\n1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:10.920\n with the Nixon White House on this issue.\n\n1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:14.360\n I mean, this was like a really big deal.\n\n1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:16.160\n It was some unbelievable stories,\n\n1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:20.100\n but he told me this, so I kind of believe these stories.\n\n1:10:20.100 --> 1:10:21.640\n Nonetheless.\n\n1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:22.920\n 25 years later.\n\n1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:24.240\n 25 years later.\n\n1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:27.080\n All this silence, basically, saying,\n\n1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:32.280\n nobody wants to do this kind of research.\n\n1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:34.620\n There's so much pressure, so much attack\n\n1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:36.360\n against this kind of research.\n\n1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:41.360\n And here's sort of a bold, stupid, crazy people\n\n1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:44.880\n that decide to dive right back in.\n\n1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:46.520\n I wonder how much discussion that was.\n\n1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:48.720\n Do we include this chapter or not?\n\n1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:51.100\n Murray has said they discussed it,\n\n1:10:51.100 --> 1:10:54.680\n and they felt they should include it.\n\n1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:59.580\n And they were very careful in the way they wrote it,\n\n1:10:59.580 --> 1:11:01.040\n which did them no good.\n\n1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:06.040\n So, as a matter of fact, when the bell curve came out,\n\n1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:08.480\n it was so controversial.\n\n1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:13.320\n I got a call from a television show called Nightline.\n\n1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:16.840\n It was with a broadcaster called Ted Koppel.\n\n1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:20.600\n We had this evening show, I think it was on late at night.\n\n1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:21.600\n Talked about news.\n\n1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:24.240\n It was a straight up news thing.\n\n1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:28.200\n And a producer called and asked if I would be on it\n\n1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:31.680\n to talk about the bell curve.\n\n1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:35.000\n And I said, she asked me what I thought\n\n1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:36.640\n about the bell curve as a book.\n\n1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:38.560\n And I said, look, it's a very good book.\n\n1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:43.080\n It talks about the role of intelligence in society.\n\n1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:44.980\n And she said, no, no, what do you think\n\n1:11:44.980 --> 1:11:47.160\n about the chapter on race?\n\n1:11:47.160 --> 1:11:49.080\n That's what we want you to talk about.\n\n1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:52.400\n I remember this conversation.\n\n1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:56.600\n I said, well, she said, what would you say\n\n1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:58.800\n if you were on TV?\n\n1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:02.240\n And I said, well, what I would say is that\n\n1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:07.240\n it's not at all clear if there's any genetic component\n\n1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.760\n to intelligence, any differences.\n\n1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:17.440\n But if there were a strong genetic component,\n\n1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:19.020\n that would be a good thing.\n\n1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:25.280\n And complete silence on the other end of the phone.\n\n1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:27.320\n And she said, well, what do you mean?\n\n1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:31.160\n And I said, well, if it's the more genetic\n\n1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:35.080\n any difference is, the more it's biological.\n\n1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:39.960\n And if it's biological, we can figure out how to fix it.\n\n1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:41.480\n I see, that's interesting.\n\n1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:43.680\n She said, would you say that on television?\n\n1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:44.520\n Yes.\n\n1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:45.340\n And I said, no.\n\n1:12:45.340 --> 1:12:47.400\n And so that was the end of that.\n\n1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:56.400\n So that's for more like biology is within the reach\n\n1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:01.400\n of science and the environment is a public policy,\n\n1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.080\n is social and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:09.120\n From your perspective, whichever one you think\n\n1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.760\n is more amenable to solutions in the short term\n\n1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:13.560\n is the one that excites you.\n\n1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:22.560\n But you saying that is good, the truth of genetic differences,\n\n1:13:22.900 --> 1:13:32.560\n no matter what, between groups is a painful, harmful,\n\n1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:35.320\n potentially dangerous thing.\n\n1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:38.080\n So let me ask you to this question,\n\n1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:40.160\n whether it's bell curve or any research\n\n1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:47.080\n on race differences, can that be used to increase\n\n1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:49.400\n the amount of racism in the world?\n\n1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:51.680\n Can that be used to increase the amount of hate\n\n1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:52.820\n in the world?\n\n1:13:52.820 --> 1:13:54.400\n Do you think about this kind of stuff?\n\n1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:57.400\n I've thought about this a lot, not as a scientist,\n\n1:13:57.400 --> 1:13:58.540\n but as a person.\n\n1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:05.680\n And my sense is there is such enormous reservoirs\n\n1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:10.680\n of hate and racism that have nothing to do\n\n1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:16.600\n with scientific knowledge of the data,\n\n1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:19.200\n that speak against that.\n\n1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:24.200\n That no, I don't wanna give racist groups a veto power\n\n1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:27.680\n over what scientists study.\n\n1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:31.440\n If you think that the differences, and by the way,\n\n1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:34.360\n virtually no one disagrees that there are differences\n\n1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:37.200\n in scores, it's all about what causes them\n\n1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:39.400\n and how to fix it.\n\n1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.920\n So if you think this is a cultural problem,\n\n1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:44.840\n then you must ask the problem,\n\n1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:49.360\n what do you want to change anything about the culture?\n\n1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:51.800\n Or are you okay with the culture?\n\n1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:53.380\n Cause you don't feel it's appropriate\n\n1:14:53.380 --> 1:14:55.600\n to change a person's culture.\n\n1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:57.160\n So are you okay with that?\n\n1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:59.720\n And the fact that that may lead to disadvantages\n\n1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:01.600\n in school achievement.\n\n1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:02.500\n It's a question.\n\n1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:05.940\n If you think it's environmental,\n\n1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:10.380\n what are the environmental parameters that can be fixed?\n\n1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:15.380\n I'll tell you one, lead from gasoline in the atmosphere.\n\n1:15:15.860 --> 1:15:18.780\n Lead in paint, lead in water.\n\n1:15:18.780 --> 1:15:22.340\n That's an environmental toxin that society\n\n1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:25.980\n has the means to eliminate, and they should.\n\n1:15:25.980 --> 1:15:30.260\n Yeah, just to sort of try and define some insights\n\n1:15:30.260 --> 1:15:32.600\n and conclusion to this very difficult topic.\n\n1:15:33.860 --> 1:15:38.740\n Is there been research on environment versus genetics,\n\n1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:40.420\n nature versus nurture, on this question\n\n1:15:40.420 --> 1:15:41.580\n of race differences?\n\n1:15:43.100 --> 1:15:46.380\n There is not, no one wants to do this research.\n\n1:15:46.380 --> 1:15:48.080\n First of all, it's hard research to do.\n\n1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:50.620\n Second of all, it's a minefield.\n\n1:15:50.620 --> 1:15:52.940\n No one wants to spend their career on it.\n\n1:15:52.940 --> 1:15:56.320\n Tenured people don't want to do it, let alone students.\n\n1:15:56.320 --> 1:15:59.600\n The way I talk about it,\n\n1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:02.440\n well, before I tell you the way I talk about it,\n\n1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:04.560\n I want to say one more thing about Jensen.\n\n1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:08.120\n He was once asked by a journalist straight out,\n\n1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:09.400\n are you a racist?\n\n1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:12.520\n His answer was very interesting.\n\n1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:15.800\n His answer was, I've thought about that a lot,\n\n1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:19.560\n and I've concluded it doesn't matter.\n\n1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:23.640\n Now, I know what he meant by this.\n\n1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:25.840\n The guts to say that, wow.\n\n1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:27.560\n He was a very unusual person.\n\n1:16:27.560 --> 1:16:29.920\n I think he had a touch of Asperger's syndrome,\n\n1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:30.940\n to tell you the truth,\n\n1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:34.160\n because I saw him in many circumstances.\n\n1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:36.140\n He would be canceled on Twitter immediately\n\n1:16:36.140 --> 1:16:37.520\n with that sentence.\n\n1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:41.060\n But what he meant was he had a hypothesis,\n\n1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:44.920\n and with respect to group differences,\n\n1:16:44.920 --> 1:16:47.400\n he called it the default hypothesis.\n\n1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:51.240\n He said, whatever factors affect individual intelligence\n\n1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:54.320\n are likely the same factors that affect group differences.\n\n1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:55.600\n It was the default.\n\n1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:58.280\n But it was a hypothesis.\n\n1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:01.040\n It should be tested, and if it turned out\n\n1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:03.680\n empirical tests didn't support the hypothesis,\n\n1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:06.480\n he was happy to move on to something else.\n\n1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:11.480\n He was absolutely committed to that scientific ideal,\n\n1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:16.040\n that it's an empirical question,\n\n1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:18.800\n we should look at it, and let's see what happens.\n\n1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:22.080\n The scientific method cannot be racist,\n\n1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:23.480\n from his perspective.\n\n1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:26.240\n It doesn't matter what the scientists,\n\n1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:30.440\n if they follow the scientific method,\n\n1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:32.080\n it doesn't matter what they believe.\n\n1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.520\n And if they are biased, and they consciously\n\n1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:39.520\n or unconsciously bias the data,\n\n1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:42.680\n other people will come along to replicate it,\n\n1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:47.680\n they will fail, and the process over time will work.\n\n1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:50.980\n So let me push back on this idea.\n\n1:17:50.980 --> 1:17:55.980\n Because psychology to me is full of gray areas.\n\n1:17:57.380 --> 1:18:01.460\n And what I've observed about psychology,\n\n1:18:01.460 --> 1:18:04.060\n even replication crisis aside,\n\n1:18:04.060 --> 1:18:06.220\n is that something about the media,\n\n1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:08.020\n something about journalism,\n\n1:18:08.020 --> 1:18:13.020\n something about the virality of ideas in the public sphere,\n\n1:18:13.700 --> 1:18:18.360\n they misinterpret, they take up things from studies,\n\n1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:23.360\n willfully or from ignorance, misinterpret findings,\n\n1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:25.720\n and tell narratives around that.\n\n1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:29.820\n I personally believe, for me,\n\n1:18:29.820 --> 1:18:31.520\n I'm not saying that broadly about science,\n\n1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:35.760\n but for me, it's my responsibility to anticipate\n\n1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:40.420\n the ways in which findings will be misinterpreted.\n\n1:18:40.420 --> 1:18:42.840\n So I thought about this a lot,\n\n1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:47.020\n because I published papers on semi autonomous vehicles,\n\n1:18:47.020 --> 1:18:52.020\n and those cars, people die in cars.\n\n1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:57.200\n There's people that have written me letters saying emails,\n\n1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:00.000\n nobody writes letters, I wish they did,\n\n1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:01.800\n that have blood on my hands,\n\n1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:04.800\n because of things that I would say positive or negative,\n\n1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:06.200\n there's consequences.\n\n1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:09.260\n In the same way, when you're a researcher of intelligence,\n\n1:19:09.260 --> 1:19:12.040\n I'm sure you might get emails,\n\n1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:14.500\n or at least people might believe\n\n1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:17.920\n that a finding of your study is going to be used\n\n1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:19.080\n by a large number of people\n\n1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:21.280\n to increase the amount of hate in the world.\n\n1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:26.060\n I think there's some responsibility on scientists,\n\n1:19:26.060 --> 1:19:29.200\n but for me, I think there's a great responsibility\n\n1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:35.400\n to anticipate the ways things will be misinterpreted,\n\n1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:37.880\n and there, you have to, first of all,\n\n1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:40.980\n decide whether you want to say a thing at all,\n\n1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:43.440\n do the study at all, publish the study at all,\n\n1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:47.160\n and two, the words with which you explain it.\n\n1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:50.640\n I find this on Twitter a lot, actually,\n\n1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:53.200\n which is, when I write a tweet,\n\n1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:55.320\n and I'm usually just doing it so innocently,\n\n1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:02.040\n I'll write it, it takes me five seconds to write it,\n\n1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:04.320\n or whatever, 30 seconds to write it,\n\n1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:08.240\n and then I'll think, all right, I close my eyes open,\n\n1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:11.680\n and try to see how will the world interpret this,\n\n1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:14.400\n what are the ways in which this will be misinterpreted,\n\n1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:16.980\n and I'll sometimes adjust that tweet to see,\n\n1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.940\n yeah, so in my mind, it's clear,\n\n1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:24.040\n but that's because it's my mind from which this tweet came,\n\n1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:26.900\n but you have to think, in a fresh mind that sees this,\n\n1:20:28.160 --> 1:20:32.840\n and it's spread across a large number of other minds,\n\n1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:36.040\n how will the interpretation morph?\n\n1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:38.260\n I mean, for a tweet, it's a silly thing, it doesn't matter,\n\n1:20:38.260 --> 1:20:43.260\n but for a scientific paper and study and finding,\n\n1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:47.240\n I think it matters.\n\n1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:49.720\n So I don't know what your thoughts are on that,\n\n1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.760\n because maybe for Jensen, the data's there,\n\n1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:55.600\n what do you want me to do?\n\n1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:59.160\n This is a scientific process that's been carried out,\n\n1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:02.200\n if you think the data was polluted by bias,\n\n1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.640\n do other studies that reveal the bias,\n\n1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:07.440\n but the data's there.\n\n1:21:07.440 --> 1:21:12.440\n And I'm not a poet, I'm not a literary writer,\n\n1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:15.640\n what do you want me to do?\n\n1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:17.560\n I'm just presenting you the data.\n\n1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:19.360\n What do you think on that spectrum?\n\n1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:21.120\n What's the role of a scientist?\n\n1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:23.540\n The reason I do podcasts,\n\n1:21:23.540 --> 1:21:27.280\n the reason I write books for the public\n\n1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:30.420\n is to explain what I think the data mean\n\n1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:32.680\n and what I think the data don't mean.\n\n1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:37.680\n I don't do very much on Twitter other than to retweet\n\n1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:39.920\n references to papers.\n\n1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:42.440\n I don't think it's my role to explain these,\n\n1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:44.880\n because they're complicated, they're nuanced.\n\n1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:51.480\n But when you decide not to do a scientific study\n\n1:21:51.560 --> 1:21:54.360\n because you're, or not to publish a result\n\n1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:59.360\n because you're afraid the result could be harmful\n\n1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:04.080\n or insensitive, that's not an unreasonable thought.\n\n1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:09.200\n And people will make different conclusions\n\n1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:11.560\n and decisions about that.\n\n1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.680\n I wrote about this, I'm the editor\n\n1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:17.000\n of a journal called Intelligence,\n\n1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:20.560\n which publishes scientific papers.\n\n1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:24.200\n Sometimes we publish papers on group differences.\n\n1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:27.040\n Those papers sometimes are controversial.\n\n1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.600\n These papers are written for a scientific audience.\n\n1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:32.160\n They're not written for the Twitter audience.\n\n1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:35.580\n I don't promote them very much on Twitter.\n\n1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:41.240\n But in a scientific paper,\n\n1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:44.600\n you have to now choose your words carefully also,\n\n1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:49.480\n because those papers are picked up by non scientists,\n\n1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:52.000\n by writers of various kinds,\n\n1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:56.120\n and you have to be available to discuss what you're saying\n\n1:22:56.120 --> 1:22:57.800\n and what you're not saying.\n\n1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:03.720\n Sometimes you are successful at having a good conversation\n\n1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:09.200\n like we are today, that doesn't start out pejorative.\n\n1:23:09.200 --> 1:23:12.520\n Other times I've been asked to participate in debates\n\n1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:16.500\n where my role would be to justify race science.\n\n1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:19.560\n Well, you can see you start out.\n\n1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:25.680\n That was a BBC request that I received.\n\n1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:28.280\n I have so much, it's a love hate relationship,\n\n1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:33.000\n mostly hate with these shallow journalism organizations.\n\n1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.160\n So they would want to use you\n\n1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:39.180\n as a kind of in a debate setting to communicate\n\n1:23:39.180 --> 1:23:42.300\n as to like there is raised differences between groups\n\n1:23:42.300 --> 1:23:46.520\n and make that into debate and put you in a role of...\n\n1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:49.280\n Justifying racism.\n\n1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:50.120\n Justifying racism.\n\n1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:51.120\n That's what they're asking me to do.\n\n1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:54.360\n Courses like educating about this field\n\n1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:56.040\n of the science of intelligence, yeah.\n\n1:23:56.040 --> 1:23:57.980\n I wanna say one more thing\n\n1:23:57.980 --> 1:24:01.320\n before we get off the normal distribution.\n\n1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:06.160\n You also asked me what is the science after the bell curve?\n\n1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:09.640\n And the short answer is there's not much new work,\n\n1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:13.420\n but whatever work there is supports the idea\n\n1:24:13.420 --> 1:24:16.280\n that there still are group differences.\n\n1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:18.560\n It's arguable whether those differences\n\n1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:20.700\n have diminished at all or not.\n\n1:24:20.700 --> 1:24:24.940\n And there is still a major problem\n\n1:24:24.940 --> 1:24:28.260\n in underperformance for school achievement\n\n1:24:29.100 --> 1:24:33.400\n for many disadvantaged and minority students.\n\n1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:37.020\n And there so far is no way to fix it.\n\n1:24:37.020 --> 1:24:39.780\n What do we do with this information?\n\n1:24:39.780 --> 1:24:42.060\n Is this now a task?\n\n1:24:42.060 --> 1:24:43.960\n Now we'll talk about the future\n\n1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:47.700\n on the neuroscience and the biology side,\n\n1:24:47.700 --> 1:24:51.100\n but in terms of this information as a society\n\n1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:53.480\n in the public policy, in the political space,\n\n1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:56.260\n in the social space, what do we do with this information?\n\n1:24:56.260 --> 1:24:57.880\n I've thought a lot about this.\n\n1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:02.880\n The first step is to have people interested in policy\n\n1:25:03.220 --> 1:25:06.940\n understand what the data actually show\n\n1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:09.800\n to pay attention to intelligence data.\n\n1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:13.460\n You can read policy papers about education\n\n1:25:13.460 --> 1:25:15.840\n and using your word processor,\n\n1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:17.860\n you can search for the word intelligence.\n\n1:25:17.860 --> 1:25:22.100\n You can search a 20,000 word document in a second\n\n1:25:22.100 --> 1:25:26.780\n and find out the word intelligence does not appear anywhere.\n\n1:25:26.780 --> 1:25:31.780\n In most discussions about what to do about achievement gaps,\n\n1:25:32.500 --> 1:25:33.640\n I'm not talking about test gaps,\n\n1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:37.340\n I'm talking about actual achievement gaps in schools,\n\n1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:40.140\n which everyone agrees is a problem,\n\n1:25:40.140 --> 1:25:43.940\n the word intelligence doesn't appear among educators.\n\n1:25:43.940 --> 1:25:44.780\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:25:44.780 --> 1:25:47.660\n As a matter of fact, in California,\n\n1:25:47.660 --> 1:25:50.020\n there has been tremendous controversy\n\n1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:53.100\n about recent attempts to revise the curriculum\n\n1:25:53.100 --> 1:25:55.500\n for math in high schools.\n\n1:25:56.380 --> 1:25:59.140\n And we had a Stanford professor of education\n\n1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:02.820\n who was running this review assert\n\n1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:06.620\n there's no such thing as talent, mathematical talent.\n\n1:26:07.860 --> 1:26:12.300\n And she wanted to get rid of the advanced classes in math\n\n1:26:12.300 --> 1:26:15.340\n because not everyone could do that.\n\n1:26:15.340 --> 1:26:17.260\n Now, of course, this has been very controversial,\n\n1:26:17.260 --> 1:26:19.260\n they've retreated somewhat,\n\n1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:21.620\n but the idea that a university professor\n\n1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:23.500\n was in charge of this who believes\n\n1:26:26.140 --> 1:26:31.140\n that there's no talent, that it doesn't exist,\n\n1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:33.540\n this is rather shocking,\n\n1:26:33.540 --> 1:26:37.460\n let alone the complete absence of intelligence data.\n\n1:26:37.460 --> 1:26:38.980\n By the way, let me tell you something\n\n1:26:38.980 --> 1:26:41.980\n about what the intelligence data show.\n\n1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:43.580\n Let's take race out of it.\n\n1:26:45.540 --> 1:26:48.260\n Even though the origins of these studies\n\n1:26:48.260 --> 1:26:50.900\n were a long time ago,\n\n1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:53.900\n I'm blocking on the name of the report,\n\n1:26:53.900 --> 1:26:57.700\n the Coleman report was a famous report about education.\n\n1:26:57.700 --> 1:27:01.900\n And they measured all kinds of variables about schools,\n\n1:27:01.900 --> 1:27:03.460\n about teachers,\n\n1:27:03.460 --> 1:27:08.100\n and they looked at academic achievement as an outcome.\n\n1:27:08.100 --> 1:27:12.660\n And they found the most predictive variables\n\n1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:15.980\n of education outcome were the variables\n\n1:27:15.980 --> 1:27:20.340\n the student brought with him or her into the school,\n\n1:27:20.340 --> 1:27:21.940\n essentially their ability.\n\n1:27:23.380 --> 1:27:26.380\n And that when you combine the school\n\n1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:29.460\n and the teacher variables together,\n\n1:27:29.460 --> 1:27:31.860\n the quality of the school, the funding of the school,\n\n1:27:31.860 --> 1:27:34.620\n the quality of the teachers, their education,\n\n1:27:34.620 --> 1:27:37.540\n you put all the teacher and school variables together,\n\n1:27:37.540 --> 1:27:40.220\n it barely accounted for 10% of the variance.\n\n1:27:41.660 --> 1:27:43.500\n And this has been replicated now.\n\n1:27:45.340 --> 1:27:50.340\n So the best research we have shows that school variables\n\n1:27:51.660 --> 1:27:54.740\n and teacher variables together account\n\n1:27:54.740 --> 1:27:58.140\n for about 10% of student academic achievement.\n\n1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:02.060\n Now, you wanna have some policy\n\n1:28:02.060 --> 1:28:04.780\n on improving academic achievement,\n\n1:28:04.780 --> 1:28:08.340\n how much money do you wanna put into teacher education?\n\n1:28:08.340 --> 1:28:11.620\n How much money do you wanna put into the quality\n\n1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:14.220\n of the school administration?\n\n1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:15.340\n You know who you can ask?\n\n1:28:15.340 --> 1:28:17.220\n You can ask the Gates Foundation,\n\n1:28:18.100 --> 1:28:21.500\n because they spent a tremendous amount of money doing that.\n\n1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:25.100\n And at the end of it, because they're measurement people,\n\n1:28:25.100 --> 1:28:27.540\n they wanna know the data,\n\n1:28:27.540 --> 1:28:29.660\n they found it had no impact at all.\n\n1:28:29.660 --> 1:28:33.460\n And they've kind of pulled out of that kind of program.\n\n1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:34.980\n So, oh boy.\n\n1:28:36.220 --> 1:28:41.220\n Let me ask you, this is me talking, but there's...\n\n1:28:41.380 --> 1:28:42.660\n Just the two of us.\n\n1:28:42.660 --> 1:28:44.900\n Just the two of us, but I'm gonna say\n\n1:28:44.900 --> 1:28:46.660\n some funny and ridiculous things,\n\n1:28:46.660 --> 1:28:49.940\n so you're surely not approving of it.\n\n1:28:51.260 --> 1:28:53.940\n But there's a movie called Clerks.\n\n1:28:53.940 --> 1:28:54.780\n You probably...\n\n1:28:54.780 --> 1:28:56.380\n I've seen it, I've seen it, yeah.\n\n1:28:56.380 --> 1:28:59.860\n There's a funny scene in there where a lovely couple\n\n1:28:59.860 --> 1:29:01.460\n are talking about the number\n\n1:29:01.460 --> 1:29:03.940\n of previous sexual partners they had.\n\n1:29:03.940 --> 1:29:07.820\n And the woman says that,\n\n1:29:07.820 --> 1:29:09.580\n I believe she just had a handful,\n\n1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:12.620\n like two or three or something like that sexual partners,\n\n1:29:12.620 --> 1:29:16.900\n but then she also mentioned that she...\n\n1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:19.020\n What's that called?\n\n1:29:19.020 --> 1:29:20.380\n Fallacia, what's the scientific?\n\n1:29:20.380 --> 1:29:23.060\n But she went, you know, gave a blow job\n\n1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:26.180\n to 37 guys, I believe it is.\n\n1:29:26.180 --> 1:29:29.980\n And so that has to do with the truth.\n\n1:29:29.980 --> 1:29:34.460\n So sometimes, knowing the truth\n\n1:29:35.940 --> 1:29:39.540\n can get in the way of a successful relationship\n\n1:29:39.540 --> 1:29:42.100\n of love of some of the human flourishing.\n\n1:29:43.020 --> 1:29:46.380\n And that seems to me that's at the core here,\n\n1:29:46.380 --> 1:29:49.860\n that facing some kind of truth\n\n1:29:49.860 --> 1:29:52.620\n that's not able to be changed\n\n1:29:53.740 --> 1:29:56.260\n makes it difficult to sort of...\n\n1:29:56.260 --> 1:29:59.940\n Is limiting as opposed to empowering.\n\n1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:01.300\n That's the concern.\n\n1:30:01.300 --> 1:30:03.940\n If you sort of test for intelligence\n\n1:30:03.940 --> 1:30:06.180\n and lay the data out,\n\n1:30:06.180 --> 1:30:09.140\n it feels like you will give up on certain people.\n\n1:30:09.140 --> 1:30:12.580\n You will sort of start bidding people,\n\n1:30:12.580 --> 1:30:15.620\n it's like, well, this person is like,\n\n1:30:15.620 --> 1:30:18.060\n let's focus on the average people\n\n1:30:18.060 --> 1:30:20.060\n or let's focus on the very intelligent people.\n\n1:30:20.060 --> 1:30:21.500\n That's the concern.\n\n1:30:21.500 --> 1:30:26.500\n And there's a kind of intuition\n\n1:30:26.700 --> 1:30:28.740\n that if we just don't measure\n\n1:30:29.580 --> 1:30:31.660\n and we don't use that data,\n\n1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:33.620\n that we will treat everybody equal\n\n1:30:33.620 --> 1:30:37.860\n and give everybody equal opportunity.\n\n1:30:37.860 --> 1:30:39.660\n If we have the data in front of us,\n\n1:30:39.660 --> 1:30:43.820\n we're likely to misdistribute\n\n1:30:43.820 --> 1:30:46.340\n the amount of sort of attention we allocate,\n\n1:30:46.340 --> 1:30:49.420\n resources we allocate to people.\n\n1:30:49.420 --> 1:30:52.180\n That's probably the concern.\n\n1:30:52.180 --> 1:30:55.100\n It's a realistic concern,\n\n1:30:55.100 --> 1:30:57.660\n but I think it's a misplaced concern\n\n1:30:57.660 --> 1:31:00.540\n if you wanna fix the problem.\n\n1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:02.060\n If you wanna fix the problem,\n\n1:31:02.060 --> 1:31:03.900\n you have to know what the problem is.\n\n1:31:03.900 --> 1:31:05.140\n Yep.\n\n1:31:05.140 --> 1:31:06.820\n Now, let me tell you this,\n\n1:31:06.820 --> 1:31:08.860\n let's go back to the bell curve,\n\n1:31:08.860 --> 1:31:11.340\n not the bell curve, but the normal distribution.\n\n1:31:11.340 --> 1:31:20.340\n Yes, 16% of the population on average has an IQ under 85,\n\n1:31:20.540 --> 1:31:22.100\n which means they're very hard.\n\n1:31:22.100 --> 1:31:24.220\n If you have an IQ under 85,\n\n1:31:24.220 --> 1:31:26.780\n it's very hard to find gainful employment\n\n1:31:26.780 --> 1:31:31.260\n at a salary that sustains you\n\n1:31:31.260 --> 1:31:35.420\n at least minimally in modern life, okay?\n\n1:31:35.420 --> 1:31:37.540\n Not impossible, but it's very difficult.\n\n1:31:37.540 --> 1:31:41.380\n 16% of the population of the United States\n\n1:31:41.380 --> 1:31:47.420\n is about 51 or 52 million people with IQs under 85.\n\n1:31:47.420 --> 1:31:51.620\n This is not a small issue.\n\n1:31:51.620 --> 1:31:55.220\n 14 million children have IQs under 85.\n\n1:31:57.100 --> 1:31:59.820\n Is this something we wanna ignore?\n\n1:31:59.820 --> 1:32:03.540\n Does this have any, what is the Venn diagram between,\n\n1:32:03.540 --> 1:32:07.140\n you know, when you have people with IQs under 85,\n\n1:32:07.140 --> 1:32:12.140\n and you have achievement in school or achievement in life?\n\n1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:16.020\n There's a lot of overlap there.\n\n1:32:16.020 --> 1:32:18.940\n This is why, to go back to the IQ pill,\n\n1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:27.380\n if there were a way to shift that curve toward the higher end,\n\n1:32:27.380 --> 1:32:30.980\n that would have a big impact.\n\n1:32:30.980 --> 1:32:34.860\n If I could maybe, before we talk about the impact on life\n\n1:32:34.860 --> 1:32:38.500\n and so on, some of the criticisms of the bell curve.\n\n1:32:38.500 --> 1:32:41.940\n So Steven Jay Gould wrote that the bell curve\n\n1:32:41.940 --> 1:32:44.860\n rests on four incorrect assumptions.\n\n1:32:44.860 --> 1:32:46.900\n It would be just interesting to get your thoughts\n\n1:32:46.900 --> 1:32:48.940\n on the four assumptions, which are,\n\n1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:51.980\n intelligence must be reducible to a single number,\n\n1:32:51.980 --> 1:32:54.740\n intelligence must be capable of rank ordering people\n\n1:32:54.740 --> 1:32:56.100\n in a linear order,\n\n1:32:56.100 --> 1:32:59.860\n intelligence must be primarily genetically based,\n\n1:32:59.860 --> 1:33:03.860\n and intelligence must be essentially immutable.\n\n1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:09.740\n Maybe not as criticisms, but as thoughts about intelligence.\n\n1:33:09.740 --> 1:33:13.620\n Oh yeah, we could spend a lot of time on him.\n\n1:33:13.620 --> 1:33:14.700\n On Steven Jay Gould?\n\n1:33:14.700 --> 1:33:15.700\n Yes.\n\n1:33:15.700 --> 1:33:20.700\n He wrote that in what, about 1985, 1984?\n\n1:33:20.700 --> 1:33:25.980\n His views were overtly political, not scientific.\n\n1:33:25.980 --> 1:33:27.380\n He was a scientist,\n\n1:33:27.380 --> 1:33:30.700\n but his views on this were overtly political,\n\n1:33:30.700 --> 1:33:33.820\n and I would encourage people listening to this,\n\n1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:38.940\n if they really want to understand his criticisms,\n\n1:33:38.940 --> 1:33:44.420\n they should just Google what he had to say,\n\n1:33:44.420 --> 1:33:49.740\n and Google the scientific reviews of his book,\n\n1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:51.500\n The Mismeasure of Man,\n\n1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:54.740\n and they will take these statements apart.\n\n1:33:54.740 --> 1:33:57.940\n They were wrong, not only were they wrong,\n\n1:33:57.940 --> 1:34:00.380\n but when he asserted in his first book\n\n1:34:00.380 --> 1:34:05.620\n that there was no biological basis essentially to IQ,\n\n1:34:05.620 --> 1:34:08.260\n by the time the second edition came around,\n\n1:34:08.260 --> 1:34:13.980\n there were studies of MRIs showing that brain size,\n\n1:34:13.980 --> 1:34:16.860\n brain volume were correlated to IQ scores,\n\n1:34:16.860 --> 1:34:19.940\n which he declined to put in his book.\n\n1:34:19.940 --> 1:34:21.900\n So I'm learning a lot today.\n\n1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:25.820\n I didn't know actually the extent of his work.\n\n1:34:25.820 --> 1:34:28.940\n I was just using a few little snippets of criticism.\n\n1:34:28.940 --> 1:34:29.940\n That's interesting.\n\n1:34:29.940 --> 1:34:30.940\n There was a battle here.\n\n1:34:30.940 --> 1:34:32.820\n He wrote a book, Mismeasure of Man,\n\n1:34:32.820 --> 1:34:36.220\n that's missing a lot of the scientific grounding.\n\n1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:39.700\n His book is highly popular in colleges today.\n\n1:34:39.700 --> 1:34:41.660\n You can find it in any college bookstore\n\n1:34:41.660 --> 1:34:42.980\n under assigned reading.\n\n1:34:42.980 --> 1:34:44.220\n It's highly popular.\n\n1:34:44.220 --> 1:34:45.220\n The Mismeasure of Man?\n\n1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:46.220\n Yes, highly influential.\n\n1:34:46.220 --> 1:34:48.580\n Can you speak to the Mismeasure of Man?\n\n1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:50.140\n I'm undereducated about this.\n\n1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:54.580\n So is this the book basically criticizing the ideas in the book?\n\n1:34:54.580 --> 1:34:57.580\n Yeah, where those four things came from.\n\n1:34:57.580 --> 1:35:04.580\n And it is really a book that was really taken apart point by point\n\n1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:08.100\n by a number of people who actually understood the data.\n\n1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:09.100\n And he didn't care.\n\n1:35:09.100 --> 1:35:10.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:11.100\n He didn't care.\n\n1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:12.100\n He didn't modify anything.\n\n1:35:12.100 --> 1:35:16.700\n Listen, because this is such a sensitive topic,\n\n1:35:16.700 --> 1:35:24.800\n like I said, I believe the impact of the work,\n\n1:35:24.800 --> 1:35:28.620\n because it is misinterpreted, has to be considered.\n\n1:35:28.620 --> 1:35:31.380\n Because it's not just going to be scientific discourse,\n\n1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:32.940\n it's going to be political discourse,\n\n1:35:32.940 --> 1:35:34.700\n there's going to be debates,\n\n1:35:34.700 --> 1:35:39.380\n there's going to be politically motivated people\n\n1:35:39.380 --> 1:35:42.780\n that will use messages in each direction,\n\n1:35:42.780 --> 1:35:45.060\n make something like the bulk of the enemy\n\n1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:52.180\n or the support for one's racist beliefs.\n\n1:35:52.180 --> 1:35:55.260\n And so I think you have to consider that.\n\n1:35:55.260 --> 1:35:59.300\n But it's difficult because Nietzsche was used by Hitler\n\n1:35:59.300 --> 1:36:02.380\n to justify a lot of his beliefs.\n\n1:36:02.380 --> 1:36:09.060\n And it's not exactly on Nietzsche to anticipate Hitler\n\n1:36:09.060 --> 1:36:12.820\n or how his ideas will be misinterpreted and used for evil.\n\n1:36:12.820 --> 1:36:14.680\n But there is a balance there.\n\n1:36:14.680 --> 1:36:15.680\n So I understand.\n\n1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:16.680\n This is really interesting.\n\n1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:17.680\n I didn't know.\n\n1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:20.740\n Is there any criticism of the book you find compelling\n\n1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:23.740\n or interesting or challenging to you from a scientific perspective?\n\n1:36:23.740 --> 1:36:29.900\n There were factual criticisms about the nature of the statistics\n\n1:36:29.900 --> 1:36:32.620\n that were used, the statistical analyses.\n\n1:36:32.620 --> 1:36:34.940\n These are more technical criticisms.\n\n1:36:34.940 --> 1:36:38.020\n And they were addressed by Murray in a couple of articles\n\n1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:41.940\n where he took all the criticisms and spoke to them.\n\n1:36:41.940 --> 1:36:44.940\n And people listening to this podcast\n\n1:36:44.940 --> 1:36:47.940\n can certainly find all those online.\n\n1:36:47.940 --> 1:36:48.980\n And it's very interesting.\n\n1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:52.740\n Murray went on to write some additional books,\n\n1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:57.860\n two in the last couple of years, one about human diversity\n\n1:36:57.860 --> 1:37:02.980\n where he goes through the data refuting the idea that race\n\n1:37:02.980 --> 1:37:07.980\n is only a social construct with no biological meaning.\n\n1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:09.820\n He discusses the data.\n\n1:37:09.820 --> 1:37:11.020\n It's a very good discussion.\n\n1:37:11.020 --> 1:37:12.500\n You don't have to agree with it.\n\n1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:16.420\n But he presents data in a cogent way.\n\n1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:19.060\n And he talks about the critics of that.\n\n1:37:19.060 --> 1:37:23.460\n And he talks about their data in a cogent, nonpersonal way.\n\n1:37:23.460 --> 1:37:26.860\n It's a very informative discussion.\n\n1:37:26.860 --> 1:37:28.940\n The book is called Human Diversity.\n\n1:37:28.940 --> 1:37:29.900\n He talks about race.\n\n1:37:29.900 --> 1:37:34.620\n And he talks about gender, same thing, about sex differences.\n\n1:37:34.620 --> 1:37:37.180\n And more recently, he's written what\n\n1:37:37.180 --> 1:37:43.060\n might be his final say on this, a book called Facing Reality\n\n1:37:43.060 --> 1:37:46.220\n where he talks about this again.\n\n1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:49.580\n So he can certainly defend himself.\n\n1:37:49.580 --> 1:37:52.100\n He doesn't need me to do that.\n\n1:37:52.100 --> 1:37:55.060\n But I would urge people who have heard\n\n1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:58.500\n about him and the bell curve and who\n\n1:37:58.500 --> 1:38:03.500\n think they know what's in it, you are likely incorrect.\n\n1:38:03.500 --> 1:38:06.300\n And you need to read it for yourself.\n\n1:38:06.300 --> 1:38:12.220\n But it is, scientifically, it's a serious subject.\n\n1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:13.580\n It's a difficult subject.\n\n1:38:13.580 --> 1:38:15.980\n Ethically, it's a difficult subject.\n\n1:38:15.980 --> 1:38:19.740\n Everything you said here, calmly and thoughtfully,\n\n1:38:19.740 --> 1:38:21.620\n is difficult. It's difficult for me\n\n1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:26.420\n to even consider that G factor exists.\n\n1:38:26.420 --> 1:38:29.860\n I don't mean from like that somehow G factor is inherently\n\n1:38:29.860 --> 1:38:32.260\n racist or sexist or whatever.\n\n1:38:32.260 --> 1:38:35.260\n It's just it's difficult in the way\n\n1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:38.220\n that considering the fact that we die one day is difficult.\n\n1:38:38.220 --> 1:38:42.820\n That we are limited by our biology is difficult.\n\n1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:47.740\n And at least from an American perspective,\n\n1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:49.300\n you would like to believe that everything\n\n1:38:49.300 --> 1:38:51.380\n is possible in this world.\n\n1:38:51.380 --> 1:38:56.220\n Well, that leads us to what I think\n\n1:38:56.220 --> 1:38:59.980\n we should do with this information.\n\n1:38:59.980 --> 1:39:03.300\n And what I think we should do with this information\n\n1:39:03.300 --> 1:39:07.660\n is unusual.\n\n1:39:07.660 --> 1:39:09.540\n Because I think what we need to do\n\n1:39:09.540 --> 1:39:13.420\n is fund more neuroscience research on the molecular\n\n1:39:13.420 --> 1:39:16.780\n biology of learning and memory.\n\n1:39:16.780 --> 1:39:22.060\n Because one definition of intelligence\n\n1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:24.580\n is based on how much you can learn\n\n1:39:24.580 --> 1:39:27.140\n and how much you can remember.\n\n1:39:27.140 --> 1:39:30.860\n And if you accept that definition of intelligence,\n\n1:39:30.860 --> 1:39:35.580\n then there are molecular studies going on now,\n\n1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:40.820\n and Nobel Prizes being won on molecular biology\n\n1:39:40.820 --> 1:39:45.420\n or molecular neurobiology of learning and memory.\n\n1:39:45.420 --> 1:39:49.500\n Now, the step those researchers, those scientists\n\n1:39:49.500 --> 1:39:53.180\n need to take when it comes to intelligence\n\n1:39:53.180 --> 1:39:58.260\n is to focus on the concept of individual differences.\n\n1:39:58.260 --> 1:40:03.740\n Intelligence research has individual differences\n\n1:40:03.740 --> 1:40:08.900\n as its heart because it assumes that people\n\n1:40:08.900 --> 1:40:10.700\n differ on this variable.\n\n1:40:10.700 --> 1:40:13.020\n And those differences are meaningful\n\n1:40:13.020 --> 1:40:15.900\n and need understanding.\n\n1:40:15.900 --> 1:40:19.340\n Cognitive psychologists who have morphed\n\n1:40:19.340 --> 1:40:23.420\n into molecular biologists studying learning and memory\n\n1:40:23.420 --> 1:40:27.460\n hate the concept of individual differences historically.\n\n1:40:27.460 --> 1:40:30.180\n Some now are coming around to it.\n\n1:40:30.180 --> 1:40:34.740\n I once sat next to a Nobel Prize winner\n\n1:40:34.740 --> 1:40:37.860\n for his work on memory.\n\n1:40:37.860 --> 1:40:41.340\n And I asked him about individual differences.\n\n1:40:41.340 --> 1:40:42.820\n And he said, don't go there.\n\n1:40:42.820 --> 1:40:46.580\n It'll set us back 50 years.\n\n1:40:46.580 --> 1:40:48.660\n But I said, don't you think they're\n\n1:40:48.660 --> 1:40:50.420\n the key, though, to understand?\n\n1:40:50.420 --> 1:40:53.980\n Why can some people remember more than others?\n\n1:40:53.980 --> 1:40:55.980\n He said, you don't want to go there.\n\n1:40:55.980 --> 1:40:58.700\n I think the 21st century will be remembered\n\n1:40:58.700 --> 1:41:02.140\n by the technology and the science that\n\n1:41:02.140 --> 1:41:04.100\n goes to individual differences.\n\n1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:05.540\n Because we have now data.\n\n1:41:05.540 --> 1:41:07.380\n We have now the tools to much, much better\n\n1:41:07.380 --> 1:41:10.100\n to start to measure, start to estimate,\n\n1:41:10.100 --> 1:41:13.940\n not just on the sort of through tests and IQ test type\n\n1:41:13.940 --> 1:41:18.220\n of things, sort of outside the body kind of things,\n\n1:41:18.220 --> 1:41:20.380\n but measuring all kinds of stuff about the body.\n\n1:41:20.380 --> 1:41:23.140\n So yeah, truly go into the molecular biology,\n\n1:41:23.140 --> 1:41:27.260\n to the neurobiology, to the neuroscience.\n\n1:41:27.260 --> 1:41:31.940\n Let me ask you about life.\n\n1:41:31.940 --> 1:41:36.820\n How does intelligence correlate with or lead to\n\n1:41:36.820 --> 1:41:39.060\n or has anything to do with career success?\n\n1:41:39.060 --> 1:41:40.660\n You've mentioned these kinds of things.\n\n1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:43.380\n And is there any data?\n\n1:41:43.380 --> 1:41:44.780\n You had an excellent conversation\n\n1:41:44.780 --> 1:41:46.740\n with Jordan Peterson, for example.\n\n1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:49.820\n Is there any data on what intelligent\n\n1:41:49.820 --> 1:41:53.380\n means for success in life?\n\n1:41:53.380 --> 1:41:54.540\n Success in life.\n\n1:41:54.540 --> 1:42:00.620\n There is a tremendous amount of validity data\n\n1:42:00.620 --> 1:42:08.260\n that looked at intelligence test scores and various measures\n\n1:42:08.260 --> 1:42:11.380\n of life success.\n\n1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:17.420\n Now, of course, life success is a pretty broad topic.\n\n1:42:17.420 --> 1:42:22.100\n And not everybody agrees on what success means.\n\n1:42:22.100 --> 1:42:28.460\n But there's general agreement on certain aspects of success\n\n1:42:28.460 --> 1:42:29.540\n that can be measured.\n\n1:42:33.180 --> 1:42:35.060\n Including life expectancy, like you said.\n\n1:42:35.060 --> 1:42:36.500\n Life expectancy.\n\n1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:37.660\n Now, there's life success.\n\n1:42:42.020 --> 1:42:47.460\n Life expectancy, I mean, that is such an interesting finding.\n\n1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:54.020\n But IQ scores are also correlated to things like income.\n\n1:42:54.020 --> 1:42:59.900\n Now, OK, so who thinks income means you're successful?\n\n1:42:59.900 --> 1:43:01.340\n That's not the point.\n\n1:43:01.340 --> 1:43:06.540\n The point is that income is one empirical measure\n\n1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:09.300\n in this culture that says something\n\n1:43:09.300 --> 1:43:11.500\n about your level of success.\n\n1:43:11.500 --> 1:43:13.620\n You can define success in ways that\n\n1:43:13.620 --> 1:43:15.980\n have nothing to do with income.\n\n1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:21.100\n You can define success based on your evolutionary natural\n\n1:43:21.100 --> 1:43:22.820\n selection success.\n\n1:43:25.220 --> 1:43:29.780\n But for variables, and even that, by the way,\n\n1:43:29.780 --> 1:43:33.940\n is correlated to IQ in some studies.\n\n1:43:33.940 --> 1:43:42.300\n So however you want to define success, IQ is important.\n\n1:43:42.300 --> 1:43:44.260\n It's not the only determinant.\n\n1:43:44.260 --> 1:43:46.780\n People get hung up on, well, what about personality?\n\n1:43:46.780 --> 1:43:49.300\n What about so called emotional intelligence?\n\n1:43:49.300 --> 1:43:51.980\n Yes, all those things matter.\n\n1:43:51.980 --> 1:43:54.460\n The thing that matters empirically,\n\n1:43:54.460 --> 1:43:56.380\n the single thing that matters the most\n\n1:43:56.380 --> 1:44:01.180\n is your general ability, your general mental intellectual\n\n1:44:01.180 --> 1:44:03.580\n ability, your reasoning ability.\n\n1:44:03.580 --> 1:44:07.100\n And the more complex your vocation,\n\n1:44:07.100 --> 1:44:11.500\n the more complex your job, the more G matters.\n\n1:44:11.500 --> 1:44:14.580\n G doesn't matter in a lot of occupations\n\n1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:17.020\n don't require complex thinking.\n\n1:44:17.020 --> 1:44:20.940\n And there are occupations like that, and G doesn't matter.\n\n1:44:20.940 --> 1:44:28.300\n Within an occupation, the G might not matter so much.\n\n1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:36.260\n So that if you look at all the professors at MIT\n\n1:44:36.260 --> 1:44:40.220\n and had a way to rank order them,\n\n1:44:40.220 --> 1:44:43.060\n there's a ceiling effect is what I'm saying.\n\n1:44:43.060 --> 1:44:45.140\n That, you know.\n\n1:44:45.140 --> 1:44:47.140\n Also, when you get past a certain threshold,\n\n1:44:47.140 --> 1:44:49.900\n then there's impact on wealth, for example,\n\n1:44:49.900 --> 1:44:52.460\n or career success, however that's\n\n1:44:52.460 --> 1:44:54.220\n defined in each individual discipline.\n\n1:44:54.220 --> 1:44:56.780\n But after a certain point, it doesn't matter.\n\n1:44:56.780 --> 1:44:59.380\n Actually, it does matter in certain things.\n\n1:44:59.380 --> 1:45:04.500\n So for example, there is a very classic study\n\n1:45:04.500 --> 1:45:07.220\n that was started at Johns Hopkins when\n\n1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:08.780\n I was a graduate student there.\n\n1:45:08.780 --> 1:45:11.260\n And I actually worked on this study at the very beginning.\n\n1:45:11.260 --> 1:45:13.700\n It's the study of mathematically and scientifically\n\n1:45:13.700 --> 1:45:15.660\n precocious youth.\n\n1:45:15.660 --> 1:45:20.140\n And they gave junior high school students\n\n1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:27.140\n age 11 and 12 the standard SAT math exam.\n\n1:45:27.140 --> 1:45:31.420\n And they found a very large number of students\n\n1:45:31.420 --> 1:45:33.900\n scored very high on this exam.\n\n1:45:33.900 --> 1:45:35.100\n Not a large number.\n\n1:45:35.100 --> 1:45:37.700\n I mean, they found many students when\n\n1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:40.700\n they cast the net to all of Baltimore.\n\n1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:42.900\n They found a number of students who\n\n1:45:42.900 --> 1:45:45.460\n scored as high on the SAT math when\n\n1:45:45.460 --> 1:45:50.220\n they were 12 years old as incoming Hopkins freshmen.\n\n1:45:50.220 --> 1:45:53.580\n And they said, gee, now this is interesting.\n\n1:45:53.580 --> 1:45:56.860\n What shall we do now?\n\n1:45:56.860 --> 1:46:00.140\n And on a case by case basis, they\n\n1:46:00.140 --> 1:46:03.860\n got some of those kids into their local community college\n\n1:46:03.860 --> 1:46:06.660\n math programs.\n\n1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:10.260\n Many of those kids went on to be very successful.\n\n1:46:10.260 --> 1:46:14.940\n And now there's a 50 year follow up of those kids.\n\n1:46:14.940 --> 1:46:21.380\n And it turns out these kids were in the top 1%.\n\n1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:24.820\n So everybody in this study is in the top 1%.\n\n1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:28.100\n If you take that group, that rarefied group,\n\n1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:33.100\n and divide them into quartiles so that you have the top 25%\n\n1:46:33.100 --> 1:46:39.780\n of the top 1% and the bottom 25% of the top 1%,\n\n1:46:39.780 --> 1:46:48.020\n you can find unmeasurable variables of success.\n\n1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.740\n The top quartile does better than the bottom quartile\n\n1:46:51.740 --> 1:46:53.780\n in the top 1%.\n\n1:46:53.780 --> 1:46:54.920\n They have more patents.\n\n1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:56.360\n They have more publications.\n\n1:46:56.360 --> 1:46:59.520\n They have more tenure at universities.\n\n1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:03.140\n And this is based on, you're dividing them\n\n1:47:03.140 --> 1:47:05.980\n based on their score at age 12.\n\n1:47:05.980 --> 1:47:10.220\n I wonder how much interesting data\n\n1:47:10.220 --> 1:47:12.700\n is in the variability in the differences.\n\n1:47:12.700 --> 1:47:16.460\n So but that's really, oh, boy.\n\n1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:17.620\n That's very interesting.\n\n1:47:17.620 --> 1:47:21.020\n But it's also, I don't know, somehow painful.\n\n1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:25.020\n I don't know why it's so painful that that G\n\n1:47:25.020 --> 1:47:31.140\n factor is so determinant of even in the nuanced top percent.\n\n1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:32.780\n This is interesting that you find that painful.\n\n1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:37.180\n Do you find it painful that people with charisma\n\n1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:40.740\n are very successful, can be very successful in life,\n\n1:47:40.740 --> 1:47:43.900\n even though having no other attributes other than they're\n\n1:47:43.900 --> 1:47:45.780\n famous and people like them?\n\n1:47:45.780 --> 1:47:47.380\n Do you find that painful?\n\n1:47:47.380 --> 1:47:51.100\n Yes, if that charisma is untrainable.\n\n1:47:51.100 --> 1:47:53.500\n So one of the things, again, this\n\n1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:56.740\n is like I learned psychology from the Johnny Depp trial.\n\n1:47:56.740 --> 1:48:01.700\n But one of the things the psychologist, the personality\n\n1:48:01.700 --> 1:48:03.380\n psychologist, he can maybe speak to this\n\n1:48:03.380 --> 1:48:07.220\n because he had an interest in this for a time,\n\n1:48:07.220 --> 1:48:12.580\n is she was saying that personality, technically\n\n1:48:12.580 --> 1:48:16.980\n speaking, is the thing that doesn't change over a lifetime.\n\n1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:20.140\n It's the thing you're, I don't know if she was actually\n\n1:48:20.140 --> 1:48:21.660\n implying that you're born with it.\n\n1:48:21.660 --> 1:48:22.780\n Well, it's a trait.\n\n1:48:22.780 --> 1:48:24.580\n It's a trait that's state.\n\n1:48:24.580 --> 1:48:27.220\n It's a trait that's relatively stable over time.\n\n1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:28.940\n I think that's generally correct.\n\n1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:31.060\n So to the degree your personality\n\n1:48:31.060 --> 1:48:36.820\n is stable over time, yes, that too is painful.\n\n1:48:36.820 --> 1:48:40.700\n Because what's not painful is the thing,\n\n1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:42.660\n if I'm fat and out of shape, I can\n\n1:48:42.660 --> 1:48:47.900\n exercise and become healthier in that way.\n\n1:48:47.900 --> 1:48:51.020\n If my diet is a giant mess and that's\n\n1:48:51.020 --> 1:48:53.860\n resulting in some kind of conditions\n\n1:48:53.860 --> 1:48:55.980\n that my body is experiencing, I can fix that\n\n1:48:55.980 --> 1:48:58.100\n by having a better diet.\n\n1:48:58.100 --> 1:49:02.100\n That sort of my actions, my willed actions\n\n1:49:02.100 --> 1:49:03.860\n can make a change.\n\n1:49:03.860 --> 1:49:07.940\n If charisma is part of the personality that's,\n\n1:49:07.940 --> 1:49:10.900\n the part of the charisma that is part of the personality that\n\n1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:15.380\n is stable, yeah, yeah, that's painful too.\n\n1:49:15.380 --> 1:49:18.420\n Because it's like, oh shit, I'm stuck with this.\n\n1:49:18.420 --> 1:49:19.860\n I'm stuck with this.\n\n1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:22.860\n Well, and this pretty much generalizes\n\n1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:24.980\n to every aspect of your being.\n\n1:49:24.980 --> 1:49:26.460\n This is who you are.\n\n1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:27.540\n You've got to deal with it.\n\n1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:29.340\n And what it undermines, of course,\n\n1:49:29.340 --> 1:49:32.580\n is a realistic appreciation for this,\n\n1:49:32.580 --> 1:49:40.740\n undermines the fairly recent idea prevalent in this country\n\n1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:44.020\n that if you work hard, you can be anything you want to be,\n\n1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:47.420\n which has morphed from the original idea\n\n1:49:47.420 --> 1:49:50.860\n that if you work hard, you can be successful.\n\n1:49:50.860 --> 1:49:53.900\n Those are two different things.\n\n1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:57.860\n And now we have if you work hard,\n\n1:49:57.860 --> 1:50:00.860\n you can be anything you want to be.\n\n1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:03.460\n This is completely unrealistic.\n\n1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:04.500\n Sorry.\n\n1:50:04.500 --> 1:50:05.180\n It just is.\n\n1:50:05.180 --> 1:50:06.900\n Now, you can work hard and be successful.\n\n1:50:06.900 --> 1:50:08.500\n There's no question.\n\n1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:09.980\n But you know what?\n\n1:50:09.980 --> 1:50:12.420\n I could work very hard, and I am not\n\n1:50:12.420 --> 1:50:16.820\n going to be a successful theoretical physicist.\n\n1:50:16.820 --> 1:50:18.740\n I'm just not.\n\n1:50:18.740 --> 1:50:21.020\n That said, I mean, we should, because we\n\n1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:26.340\n had this conversation already, but it's good to repeat.\n\n1:50:26.340 --> 1:50:27.700\n The fact that you're not going to be\n\n1:50:27.700 --> 1:50:31.100\n a theoretical physicist is not judgment\n\n1:50:31.100 --> 1:50:32.820\n on your basic humanity.\n\n1:50:32.820 --> 1:50:36.180\n We're turning again to the all men, which means\n\n1:50:36.180 --> 1:50:39.100\n men and women are created equal.\n\n1:50:39.100 --> 1:50:40.620\n So again, some of the differences\n\n1:50:40.620 --> 1:50:47.020\n we're talking about in quote unquote success, wealth,\n\n1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:50.620\n number of whether you win a Nobel Prize or not,\n\n1:50:50.620 --> 1:50:55.820\n that doesn't put a measure on your basic humanity\n\n1:50:55.820 --> 1:51:00.940\n and basic value and even goodness of you\n\n1:51:00.940 --> 1:51:02.500\n as a human being.\n\n1:51:02.500 --> 1:51:06.900\n Because your basic role and value in society\n\n1:51:06.900 --> 1:51:11.940\n is largely within your control.\n\n1:51:11.940 --> 1:51:16.740\n It's some of these measures that we're talking about.\n\n1:51:16.740 --> 1:51:19.380\n It's good to remember this.\n\n1:51:19.380 --> 1:51:22.260\n One question about the Flynn effect.\n\n1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:23.260\n What is it?\n\n1:51:23.260 --> 1:51:27.140\n Are humans getting smarter over the years, over the decades,\n\n1:51:27.140 --> 1:51:28.820\n over the centuries?\n\n1:51:28.820 --> 1:51:33.500\n The Flynn effect is James Flynn, who passed away about a year\n\n1:51:33.500 --> 1:51:42.420\n ago, published a set of analyses going back\n\n1:51:42.420 --> 1:51:46.020\n a couple of decades when he first noticed this,\n\n1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:51.460\n that IQ scores, when you looked over the years,\n\n1:51:51.460 --> 1:51:54.420\n seemed to be drifting up.\n\n1:51:54.420 --> 1:51:58.820\n Now, this was not unknown to the people who make the test\n\n1:51:58.820 --> 1:52:02.220\n because they renorm the test periodically\n\n1:52:02.220 --> 1:52:05.260\n and they have to renorm the test periodically\n\n1:52:05.260 --> 1:52:09.700\n because what 10 items correct meant\n\n1:52:09.700 --> 1:52:13.700\n relative to other people 50 years ago\n\n1:52:13.700 --> 1:52:18.580\n is not the same as what 10 items mean relative today.\n\n1:52:18.580 --> 1:52:21.220\n People are getting more things correct.\n\n1:52:21.220 --> 1:52:24.980\n Now, the scores have been drifting up about three points.\n\n1:52:24.980 --> 1:52:30.180\n IQ scores have been drifting up about three points per decade.\n\n1:52:30.180 --> 1:52:31.700\n This is not a personal effect.\n\n1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:34.020\n This is a cohort effect.\n\n1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:37.100\n Well, it's not for an individual, but.\n\n1:52:37.100 --> 1:52:38.700\n The world, how do you explain?\n\n1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:39.500\n So what's that?\n\n1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:42.420\n And this has presented intelligence researchers\n\n1:52:42.420 --> 1:52:44.580\n with a great mystery.\n\n1:52:44.580 --> 1:52:46.220\n Two questions.\n\n1:52:46.220 --> 1:52:51.140\n First, is it effect on the 50% of the variance that's\n\n1:52:51.140 --> 1:52:55.060\n the G factor or on the other 50%?\n\n1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:59.620\n And there's evidence that it is a G factor effect.\n\n1:52:59.620 --> 1:53:02.660\n And second, what on earth causes this?\n\n1:53:02.660 --> 1:53:05.780\n And doesn't this mean intelligence and G factor\n\n1:53:05.780 --> 1:53:10.220\n cannot be genetic because the scale of natural selection\n\n1:53:10.220 --> 1:53:15.660\n is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago?\n\n1:53:15.660 --> 1:53:19.700\n And so it's been used to try to undermine the idea\n\n1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:24.420\n that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence.\n\n1:53:24.420 --> 1:53:28.540\n But certainly, it can be the Flynn effect\n\n1:53:28.540 --> 1:53:32.060\n can affect the nongenetic aspects of intelligence\n\n1:53:32.060 --> 1:53:37.700\n because genes account for maybe 50% of the variance.\n\n1:53:37.700 --> 1:53:40.900\n Maybe higher, could be as high as 80% for adults,\n\n1:53:40.900 --> 1:53:46.420\n but let's just say 50% for discussion.\n\n1:53:46.420 --> 1:53:50.260\n So the Flynn effect, it's still a mystery.\n\n1:53:50.260 --> 1:53:51.180\n It's still a mystery.\n\n1:53:51.180 --> 1:53:51.780\n That's interesting.\n\n1:53:51.780 --> 1:53:54.060\n It's still a mystery, although the evidence is coming out.\n\n1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:56.700\n I told you before I edited a journal on intelligence,\n\n1:53:56.700 --> 1:54:00.460\n and we're doing a special issue in honor of James Flynn.\n\n1:54:00.460 --> 1:54:03.060\n So I'm starting to see papers now on really\n\n1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:06.300\n the latest research on this.\n\n1:54:06.300 --> 1:54:08.820\n I think most people who specialize\n\n1:54:08.820 --> 1:54:12.460\n in this area of trying to understand the Flynn effect\n\n1:54:12.460 --> 1:54:16.460\n are coming to the view based on data\n\n1:54:16.460 --> 1:54:20.180\n that it has to do with advances in nutrition and health care.\n\n1:54:20.180 --> 1:54:25.100\n And there's also evidence that the effect is slowing down\n\n1:54:25.100 --> 1:54:27.500\n and possibly reversing.\n\n1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:28.340\n Oh, boy.\n\n1:54:28.340 --> 1:54:30.580\n So how would nutrition and health,\n\n1:54:30.580 --> 1:54:36.300\n so nutrition would still be connected to the G factor.\n\n1:54:36.300 --> 1:54:38.660\n So nutrition as it relates to the G factor,\n\n1:54:38.660 --> 1:54:42.060\n so the biology that leads to the intelligence.\n\n1:54:42.060 --> 1:54:42.580\n Yes.\n\n1:54:42.580 --> 1:54:43.820\n That would be the claim.\n\n1:54:43.820 --> 1:54:50.300\n Like the hypothesis being tested by the research.\n\n1:54:50.300 --> 1:54:50.820\n Yes.\n\n1:54:50.820 --> 1:54:54.460\n And there's some evidence from infants\n\n1:54:54.460 --> 1:54:58.540\n that nutrition has made a difference.\n\n1:54:58.540 --> 1:55:02.140\n So it's not an unreasonable connection.\n\n1:55:02.140 --> 1:55:05.740\n But does it negate the idea that there's a genetic influence?\n\n1:55:05.740 --> 1:55:07.980\n Not logically at all.\n\n1:55:07.980 --> 1:55:09.860\n But it is very interesting.\n\n1:55:09.860 --> 1:55:17.460\n So that if you take an IQ test today but you take the score\n\n1:55:17.460 --> 1:55:22.900\n and use the tables that were available in 1940,\n\n1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:27.020\n you're going to wind up with a much higher IQ number.\n\n1:55:27.020 --> 1:55:32.700\n So are we really smarter than a couple of generations ago?\n\n1:55:32.700 --> 1:55:38.300\n No, but we might be able to solve problems a little better.\n\n1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:43.140\n And make use of our G because of things like Sesame Street\n\n1:55:43.140 --> 1:55:45.380\n and other curricula in school.\n\n1:55:45.380 --> 1:55:49.540\n More people are going to school.\n\n1:55:49.540 --> 1:55:53.820\n So there are a lot of factors here to disentangle.\n\n1:55:53.820 --> 1:55:55.060\n It's fascinating though.\n\n1:55:55.060 --> 1:55:58.860\n It's fascinating that there's not clear answers yet.\n\n1:55:58.860 --> 1:56:02.620\n That as a population, we're getting smarter.\n\n1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:04.500\n When you just zoom out, that's what it looks like.\n\n1:56:04.500 --> 1:56:06.020\n As a population, we're getting smarter.\n\n1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:08.740\n And it's interesting to see what the effects of that are.\n\n1:56:08.740 --> 1:56:10.060\n I mean, this raises the question.\n\n1:56:10.060 --> 1:56:14.420\n We've mentioned it many times but haven't clearly addressed it,\n\n1:56:14.420 --> 1:56:17.260\n which is nature versus nurture question.\n\n1:56:17.260 --> 1:56:20.060\n So how much of intelligence is nature?\n\n1:56:20.060 --> 1:56:21.860\n How much of it is nurture?\n\n1:56:21.860 --> 1:56:25.700\n How much of it is determined by genetics versus environment?\n\n1:56:25.700 --> 1:56:26.700\n All of it.\n\n1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:28.100\n All of it is genetics.\n\n1:56:28.100 --> 1:56:32.620\n No, all of it is nature and nurture.\n\n1:56:32.620 --> 1:56:33.620\n So yes.\n\n1:56:33.620 --> 1:56:34.620\n Yes.\n\n1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:36.620\n Okay.\n\n1:56:36.620 --> 1:56:44.940\n But how much of the variance can you apportion to either?\n\n1:56:44.940 --> 1:56:51.580\n Most of the people who work in this field say that the framing of that, if the question\n\n1:56:51.580 --> 1:56:57.500\n is framed that way, it can't be answered because nature and nurture are not two independent\n\n1:56:57.500 --> 1:56:59.460\n influences.\n\n1:56:59.460 --> 1:57:01.420\n They interact with each other.\n\n1:57:01.420 --> 1:57:10.220\n And understanding those interactions is so complex that many behavioral geneticists say\n\n1:57:10.220 --> 1:57:17.380\n it is today impossible and always will be impossible to disentangle that, no matter\n\n1:57:17.380 --> 1:57:24.700\n what kind of advances there are in DNA technology and genomic informatics.\n\n1:57:24.700 --> 1:57:31.580\n But there's still, to push back on that, that same intuition from behavioral geneticists\n\n1:57:31.580 --> 1:57:37.340\n would lead me to believe that there cannot possibly be a stable G factor because it's\n\n1:57:37.340 --> 1:57:39.300\n super complex.\n\n1:57:39.300 --> 1:57:45.300\n Many of them would assert that as a logical outcome.\n\n1:57:45.300 --> 1:57:51.820\n But because I believe there is a stable G factor from lots of sources of data, not just\n\n1:57:51.820 --> 1:58:01.380\n one study, but lots of sources of data over decades, I am more amenable to the idea that\n\n1:58:01.380 --> 1:58:09.940\n whatever interactions between genes and environment exist, they can be explicated, they can be\n\n1:58:09.940 --> 1:58:19.300\n studied, and that information can be used as a basis for molecular biology of intelligence.\n\n1:58:19.300 --> 1:58:27.300\n Yeah, and we'll do this exact question because doesn't the stability of the G factor give\n\n1:58:27.300 --> 1:58:33.780\n you at least a hint that there is a biological basis for intelligence?\n\n1:58:33.780 --> 1:58:42.820\n Yes, I think it's clear that the fact that an IQ score is correlated to things like thickness\n\n1:58:42.820 --> 1:58:55.340\n of your cortex, that it's correlated to glucose metabolic rate in your brain, that identical\n\n1:58:55.340 --> 1:59:02.060\n twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ scores.\n\n1:59:02.060 --> 1:59:12.140\n These are all important observations that indicate, not just suggest, but indicate that\n\n1:59:12.140 --> 1:59:13.540\n there's a biological basis.\n\n1:59:13.540 --> 1:59:18.620\n And does anyone believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain?\n\n1:59:18.620 --> 1:59:21.220\n I mean, it's so obvious.\n\n1:59:21.220 --> 1:59:26.620\n Well indirectly definitely has to do with it, but the question is environment interacting\n\n1:59:26.620 --> 1:59:34.920\n with the brain or is it the actual raw hardware of the brain?\n\n1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:45.500\n Well some would say that the raw hardware of the brain as it develops from conception\n\n1:59:45.500 --> 1:59:52.700\n through adulthood, or at least through the childhood, that that so called hardware that\n\n1:59:52.700 --> 2:00:01.220\n you are assuming is mostly genetic, in fact, is not as deterministic as you might think,\n\n2:00:01.220 --> 2:00:09.740\n but it is probabilistic and what affects the probabilities are things like in uterine environment\n\n2:00:09.740 --> 2:00:15.140\n and other factors like that, including chance.\n\n2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:22.680\n That chance affects the way the neurons are connecting during gestation.\n\n2:00:22.680 --> 2:00:26.820\n It's not, hey, it's pre programmed.\n\n2:00:26.820 --> 2:00:35.500\n So there is push back on the concept that genes provide a blueprint, that it's a lot\n\n2:00:35.500 --> 2:00:36.500\n more fluid.\n\n2:00:36.500 --> 2:00:44.020\n Well, but also, yeah, so there's a lot, a lot, a lot happens in the first few months\n\n2:00:44.020 --> 2:00:47.340\n of development.\n\n2:00:47.340 --> 2:00:57.180\n So in nine months inside the mother's body and in the few months afterwards, there's\n\n2:00:57.180 --> 2:01:02.120\n a lot of fascinating stuff, like including chance and luck, like you said, how things\n\n2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:04.220\n connect up.\n\n2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:08.460\n The question is afterwards in your plasticity of the brain, how much adjustment there is\n\n2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:14.140\n relative to the environment, how much that affects the G factor, but that's where the\n\n2:01:14.140 --> 2:01:19.140\n whole conclusions of the studies that we've been talking about is that seems to have less\n\n2:01:19.140 --> 2:01:23.620\n and less and less of an effect as pretty quickly.\n\n2:01:23.620 --> 2:01:30.060\n As yes, and I do think there is more of a genetic, by my view, and I'm not an expert\n\n2:01:30.060 --> 2:01:34.180\n on this, I mean, genetics is a highly technical and complex subject.\n\n2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:41.900\n I am not a geneticist, not a behavioral geneticist, but my reading of this, my interpretation\n\n2:01:41.900 --> 2:01:50.880\n of this is that there is a genetic blueprint, more or less, and that has a profound influence\n\n2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:56.700\n on your subsequent intellectual development, including the G factor.\n\n2:01:56.700 --> 2:02:03.900\n And that's not to say things can't happen to, I mean, if you think of that genes provide\n\n2:02:03.900 --> 2:02:12.060\n a potential, fine, and then various variables impact that potential, and every parent of\n\n2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:19.520\n a newborn, implicitly or explicitly, wants to maximize that potential.\n\n2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:21.980\n This is why you buy educational toys.\n\n2:02:21.980 --> 2:02:25.660\n This is why you pay attention to organic baby food.\n\n2:02:25.660 --> 2:02:31.620\n This is why you do all these things, because you want your baby to be as healthy and as\n\n2:02:31.620 --> 2:02:36.000\n smart as possible, and every parent will say that.\n\n2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:45.220\n Is there a case to be made, can you steel man the case, that genetics is a very tiny\n\n2:02:45.220 --> 2:02:49.420\n component of all of this, and the environment is essential?\n\n2:02:49.420 --> 2:02:53.460\n I don't think the data supports that genetics is a tiny component.\n\n2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:58.260\n I think the data support the idea that the genetics is a very important, and I don't\n\n2:02:58.260 --> 2:03:05.740\n say component, I say influence, a very important influence, and the environment is a lot less\n\n2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:07.900\n than people believe.\n\n2:03:07.900 --> 2:03:10.700\n Most people believe environment plays a big role.\n\n2:03:10.700 --> 2:03:11.700\n I'm not so sure.\n\n2:03:11.700 --> 2:03:19.420\n I guess what I'm asking you is, can you see where what you just said, it might be wrong?\n\n2:03:19.420 --> 2:03:27.140\n Can you imagine a world, and what kind of evidence would you need to see to say, you\n\n2:03:27.140 --> 2:03:31.700\n know what, the intuition, the studies so far, like reversing the directions.\n\n2:03:31.700 --> 2:03:36.140\n So one of the cool things we have now more and more is we're getting more and more data,\n\n2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:41.860\n and the rate of the data is escalating because of the digital world.\n\n2:03:41.860 --> 2:03:48.700\n So when you start to look at a very large scale of data, both on the biology side and\n\n2:03:48.700 --> 2:03:53.860\n the social side, we might be discovering some very counterintuitive things about society.\n\n2:03:53.860 --> 2:04:00.300\n We might see the edge cases that reveal that if we actually scale those edge cases and\n\n2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:08.080\n they become like the norm, that we'll have a complete shift in our, like you'll see G\n\n2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:15.300\n factor be able to be modified throughout life in the teens and in later life.\n\n2:04:15.300 --> 2:04:20.700\n So is it any case you can make or for where your current intuitions are wrong?\n\n2:04:20.700 --> 2:04:25.300\n Yes, and it's a good question because I think everyone should always be asked what evidence\n\n2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:28.020\n would change your mind.\n\n2:04:28.020 --> 2:04:32.860\n It's certainly not only a fair question, it is really the key question for anybody working\n\n2:04:32.860 --> 2:04:36.580\n on any aspect of science.\n\n2:04:36.580 --> 2:04:45.900\n I think that if environment was very important, we would have seen it clearly by now.\n\n2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:53.660\n It would have been obvious that school interventions, compensatory education, early childhood education,\n\n2:04:53.660 --> 2:04:59.340\n all these things that have been earnestly tried in well funded, well designed studies\n\n2:04:59.340 --> 2:05:02.940\n would show some effect, and they don't.\n\n2:05:02.940 --> 2:05:08.260\n What if the school, the way we've tried school, compensatory school sucks and we need to do\n\n2:05:08.260 --> 2:05:09.260\n better?\n\n2:05:09.260 --> 2:05:10.260\n That's what everybody said at the beginning.\n\n2:05:10.260 --> 2:05:11.760\n That's what everybody said to Jensen.\n\n2:05:11.760 --> 2:05:15.720\n He said, well, maybe we need to start earlier.\n\n2:05:15.720 --> 2:05:20.320\n Maybe we need not do prekindergarten, but pre, prekindergarten.\n\n2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:24.620\n It's always an infinite, well, maybe we didn't get it right.\n\n2:05:24.620 --> 2:05:33.580\n But after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely something would\n\n2:05:33.580 --> 2:05:39.700\n have worked to the point where you could actually see a result and not need a probability level\n\n2:05:39.700 --> 2:05:42.540\n at 0.05 on some means.\n\n2:05:42.540 --> 2:05:49.380\n So that's why I, that's the kind of evidence that would change my mind.\n\n2:05:49.380 --> 2:05:56.940\n Population level interventions like schooling that you would see like this actually has\n\n2:05:56.940 --> 2:05:57.940\n an effect.\n\n2:05:57.940 --> 2:05:58.940\n Yes.\n\n2:05:58.940 --> 2:06:04.940\n And when you take adopted kids and they grow up in another family and you find out when\n\n2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:09.980\n those adopted kids are adults, their IQ scores don't correlate with the IQ scores of their\n\n2:06:09.980 --> 2:06:15.820\n adoptive parents, but they do correlate with their IQ scores of their biological parents\n\n2:06:15.820 --> 2:06:18.860\n whom they've never met.\n\n2:06:18.860 --> 2:06:22.100\n I mean, these are important, these are powerful observations.\n\n2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:26.500\n And it would be convincing to you if the reverse was true.\n\n2:06:26.500 --> 2:06:27.500\n Yes.\n\n2:06:27.500 --> 2:06:28.500\n That would be more.\n\n2:06:28.500 --> 2:06:35.180\n And there is some data on adoption that indicates that the adopted children are moving a little\n\n2:06:35.180 --> 2:06:40.220\n bit more toward their adoptive parents.\n\n2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:47.500\n But it's to me the overwhelming, I have this concept called the weight of evidence where\n\n2:06:47.500 --> 2:06:50.500\n I don't interpret any one study too much.\n\n2:06:50.500 --> 2:06:53.540\n The weight of evidence tells me genes are important.\n\n2:06:53.540 --> 2:06:54.780\n But what does that mean?\n\n2:06:54.780 --> 2:06:57.100\n What does it mean that genes are important?\n\n2:06:57.100 --> 2:07:03.180\n Knowing that gene expression, genes don't express themselves in a vacuum, they express\n\n2:07:03.180 --> 2:07:05.900\n themselves in an environment.\n\n2:07:05.900 --> 2:07:10.300\n So the environment has to have something to do with it, especially if the best genetic\n\n2:07:10.300 --> 2:07:17.740\n estimates of the amount of variants are around 50 or even if it's as high as 80%, it still\n\n2:07:17.740 --> 2:07:21.540\n leaves 20% of non genetic.\n\n2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:24.300\n Now maybe that is all luck.\n\n2:07:24.300 --> 2:07:25.580\n Maybe that's all chance.\n\n2:07:25.580 --> 2:07:31.320\n I could believe that, I could easily believe that.\n\n2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:39.060\n But I do think after 50 years of trying various interventions and nothing works, including\n\n2:07:39.060 --> 2:07:44.340\n memory training, including listening to Mozart, including playing computer games, none of\n\n2:07:44.340 --> 2:07:49.060\n that has shown any impact on intelligence test scores.\n\n2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:57.140\n Is there data on the intelligence, the IQ of parents as it relates to the children?\n\n2:07:57.140 --> 2:08:07.020\n Yes, and there is some genetic evidence of an interaction between the parents IQ and\n\n2:08:07.020 --> 2:08:08.760\n the environment.\n\n2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:17.020\n High IQ parents provide an enriched environment, which then can impact the child in addition\n\n2:08:17.020 --> 2:08:20.020\n to the genes, it's that environment.\n\n2:08:20.020 --> 2:08:29.060\n So there are all these interactions that, think about the number of books in a household.\n\n2:08:29.060 --> 2:08:37.140\n This was a variable that's correlated with IQ and, well, why?\n\n2:08:37.140 --> 2:08:42.900\n Especially if the kid never reads any of the books, it's because more intelligent people\n\n2:08:42.900 --> 2:08:45.620\n have more books in their house.\n\n2:08:45.620 --> 2:08:52.500\n And if you're more intelligent and there's a genetic component to that, the child will\n\n2:08:52.500 --> 2:08:57.480\n get those genes or some of those genes as well as the environment.\n\n2:08:57.480 --> 2:09:04.140\n But it's not the number of books in the house that actually directly impacts the child.\n\n2:09:04.140 --> 2:09:11.620\n So the two scenarios on this are you find that, and this was used to get rid of the\n\n2:09:11.620 --> 2:09:18.300\n SAT test, oh, the SAT score is highly correlated with the social economic status of the parents.\n\n2:09:18.300 --> 2:09:21.540\n So all you're really measuring is how rich the parents are.\n\n2:09:21.540 --> 2:09:27.620\n Okay, well, why are the parents rich?\n\n2:09:27.620 --> 2:09:37.940\n And so the opposite kind of syllogism is that people who are very bright make more money,\n\n2:09:37.940 --> 2:09:44.540\n they can afford homes in better neighborhoods so their kids get better schools.\n\n2:09:44.540 --> 2:09:47.780\n Now the kids grow up bright.\n\n2:09:47.780 --> 2:09:51.340\n Where in that chain of events does that come from?\n\n2:09:51.340 --> 2:09:58.720\n Well, unless you have a genetically informative research design where you look at siblings\n\n2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:05.940\n that have the same biological parents and so on, you can't really disentangle all that.\n\n2:10:05.940 --> 2:10:12.820\n Most studies of social economic status and intelligence do not have a genetically informed\n\n2:10:12.820 --> 2:10:13.940\n design.\n\n2:10:13.940 --> 2:10:20.580\n So any conclusions they make about the causality of the social economic status being the cause\n\n2:10:20.580 --> 2:10:25.540\n of the IQ is a stretch.\n\n2:10:25.540 --> 2:10:33.140\n And where you do find genetically informative designs, you find most of the variance in\n\n2:10:33.140 --> 2:10:38.980\n your outcome measures are due to the genetic component.\n\n2:10:38.980 --> 2:10:46.480\n And sometimes the SES adds a little, but the weight of evidence is it doesn't add very\n\n2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:52.660\n much variance to predict what's going on beyond the genetic variance.\n\n2:10:52.660 --> 2:10:58.780\n So when you actually look at it in some, and there aren't that many studies that have genetically\n\n2:10:58.780 --> 2:11:05.060\n informed designs, but when you do see those, the genes seem to have an advantage.\n\n2:11:05.060 --> 2:11:13.620\n Sorry for the strange questions, but is there a connection between fertility or the number\n\n2:11:13.620 --> 2:11:16.860\n of kids that you have and G factor?\n\n2:11:16.860 --> 2:11:25.600\n So you know, the kind of conventional wisdom is people of maybe higher economic status\n\n2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:28.180\n or something like that are having fewer children.\n\n2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:30.900\n I just loosely hear these kinds of things.\n\n2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:36.580\n Is there data that you're aware of in one direction or another on this?\n\n2:11:36.580 --> 2:11:39.060\n Strange questions always get strange answers.\n\n2:11:39.060 --> 2:11:40.060\n Yes.\n\n2:11:40.060 --> 2:11:41.060\n All right.\n\n2:11:41.060 --> 2:11:44.740\n Do you have a strange answer for that strange question?\n\n2:11:44.740 --> 2:11:54.540\n The answer is there were some studies that indicated the more children in a family, the\n\n2:11:54.540 --> 2:12:00.740\n firstborn children would be more intelligent than the fourth or fifth or sixth.\n\n2:12:00.740 --> 2:12:05.500\n It's not clear that those studies hold up over time.\n\n2:12:05.500 --> 2:12:14.020\n And of course what you see also is that families where there are multiple children, four, five,\n\n2:12:14.020 --> 2:12:23.580\n six, seven, you know, really big families, the social economic status of those families\n\n2:12:23.580 --> 2:12:28.700\n usually in the modern age is not that high.\n\n2:12:28.700 --> 2:12:33.500\n Maybe it used to be the aristocracy used to have a lot of kids, I'm not sure exactly.\n\n2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:44.020\n But there have been reports of correlations between IQ and fertility, but I'm not sure\n\n2:12:44.020 --> 2:12:50.500\n that the data are very strong that the firstborn child is always the smartest.\n\n2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:54.980\n It seems like there's some data to that, but I'm not current on that.\n\n2:12:54.980 --> 2:12:55.980\n How would that be explained?\n\n2:12:55.980 --> 2:12:58.260\n That would be in a nurture.\n\n2:12:58.260 --> 2:13:08.500\n Well, it could be nurture, it could be in uterine environment, I mean, and this is why\n\n2:13:08.500 --> 2:13:14.740\n this, you know, like many areas of science, you said earlier that there are a lot of gray\n\n2:13:14.740 --> 2:13:21.660\n areas and no definitive answers.\n\n2:13:21.660 --> 2:13:28.900\n This is not uncommon in science that the closer you look at a problem, the more questions\n\n2:13:28.900 --> 2:13:35.820\n you get, not the fewer questions, because the universe is complicated.\n\n2:13:35.820 --> 2:13:42.980\n And the idea that we have people on this planet who can study the first nanoseconds of the\n\n2:13:42.980 --> 2:13:48.260\n Big Bang, that's pretty amazing.\n\n2:13:48.260 --> 2:13:53.340\n And I've always said that if they can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang, we\n\n2:13:53.340 --> 2:13:58.900\n can certainly figure out something about intelligence that allows that.\n\n2:13:58.900 --> 2:14:06.020\n I'm not sure what's more complicated, the human mind or the physics of the universe.\n\n2:14:06.020 --> 2:14:08.220\n It's unclear to me.\n\n2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:09.220\n I think we overemphasize.\n\n2:14:09.220 --> 2:14:13.220\n Well, that's a very humbling statement.\n\n2:14:13.220 --> 2:14:18.100\n Maybe it's a very human centric, egotistical statement that our mind is somehow super complicated,\n\n2:14:18.100 --> 2:14:22.860\n but biology is a tricky one to unravel.\n\n2:14:22.860 --> 2:14:27.100\n Consciousness, what is that?\n\n2:14:27.100 --> 2:14:34.180\n I've always believed that consciousness and intelligence are the two real fundamental\n\n2:14:34.180 --> 2:14:41.380\n problems of the human brain, and therefore I think they must be related.\n\n2:14:41.380 --> 2:14:49.060\n Yeah, heart problems like walk together, holding hands kind of idea.\n\n2:14:49.060 --> 2:14:54.180\n You may not know this, but I did some of the early research on anesthetic drugs with brain\n\n2:14:54.180 --> 2:14:58.900\n imaging trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off\n\n2:14:58.900 --> 2:15:01.520\n when someone loses consciousness?\n\n2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:07.060\n And is that the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness is regained?\n\n2:15:07.060 --> 2:15:11.060\n And I was working with an anesthesiologist named Mike Alkire, who was really brilliant\n\n2:15:11.060 --> 2:15:12.060\n at this.\n\n2:15:12.060 --> 2:15:18.300\n These were really the first studies of brain imaging using positron emission tomography\n\n2:15:18.300 --> 2:15:21.700\n long before fMRI.\n\n2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:28.220\n And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labeled the brain, and the harder the brain\n\n2:15:28.220 --> 2:15:33.980\n was working, the more sugar it would take up, and then you could make a picture of glucose\n\n2:15:33.980 --> 2:15:36.420\n use in the brain.\n\n2:15:36.420 --> 2:15:38.560\n And he was amazing.\n\n2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:44.860\n He managed to do this in normal volunteers he brought in and anesthetized as if they\n\n2:15:44.860 --> 2:15:49.060\n were going into surgery.\n\n2:15:49.060 --> 2:15:55.380\n He managed all the human subjects requirements on this research, and he was brilliant at\n\n2:15:55.380 --> 2:15:57.100\n this.\n\n2:15:57.100 --> 2:16:05.140\n And what we did is we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions.\n\n2:16:05.140 --> 2:16:14.800\n On one occasion, he gave them enough anesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy.\n\n2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:20.780\n And on another occasion, they came in and he fully anesthetized them.\n\n2:16:20.780 --> 2:16:31.820\n And he would say, Mike, can you hear me, and the person would say, uh, yeah.\n\n2:16:31.820 --> 2:16:37.540\n And then we would scan people under no anesthetic condition.\n\n2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:39.980\n So same person.\n\n2:16:39.980 --> 2:16:46.780\n And we were looking to see if we could see the part of the brain turn off.\n\n2:16:46.780 --> 2:16:51.980\n He subsequently tried to do this with fMRI, which has a faster time resolution, and you\n\n2:16:51.980 --> 2:16:56.780\n could do it in real time as the person went under and then regain consciousness where\n\n2:16:56.780 --> 2:16:57.980\n you couldn't do that with PET.\n\n2:16:57.980 --> 2:17:00.780\n You had to have three different occasions.\n\n2:17:00.780 --> 2:17:03.380\n And the results were absolutely fascinating.\n\n2:17:03.380 --> 2:17:08.600\n We did this with different anesthetic drugs, and different drugs impacted different parts\n\n2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:09.780\n of the brain.\n\n2:17:09.780 --> 2:17:15.820\n So we were naturally looking for the common one, and it seemed to have something to do\n\n2:17:15.820 --> 2:17:18.300\n with the thalamus.\n\n2:17:18.300 --> 2:17:25.740\n And consciousness, this was actual data on consciousness, actual consciousness.\n\n2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:28.420\n What part of the brain turns on?\n\n2:17:28.420 --> 2:17:30.900\n What part of the brain turns off?\n\n2:17:30.900 --> 2:17:33.220\n It's not so clear.\n\n2:17:33.220 --> 2:17:35.940\n But maybe has something to do with the thalamus.\n\n2:17:35.940 --> 2:17:41.180\n The sequence of events seemed to have the thalamus in it.\n\n2:17:41.180 --> 2:17:42.700\n Now here's the question.\n\n2:17:42.700 --> 2:17:45.780\n Are some people more conscious than others?\n\n2:17:45.780 --> 2:17:49.660\n Are there individual differences in consciousness?\n\n2:17:49.660 --> 2:17:53.020\n And I don't mean it in the psychedelic sense.\n\n2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:55.780\n I don't mean it in the political consciousness sense.\n\n2:17:55.780 --> 2:17:57.300\n I just mean it in everyday life.\n\n2:17:57.300 --> 2:18:01.900\n Do some people go through everyday life more conscious than others?\n\n2:18:01.900 --> 2:18:06.700\n And are those the people we might actually label more intelligent?\n\n2:18:06.700 --> 2:18:11.700\n Now the other thing I was looking for is whether the parts of the brain we were seeing in the\n\n2:18:11.700 --> 2:18:16.820\n anesthesia studies were the same parts of the brain we were seeing in the intelligence\n\n2:18:16.820 --> 2:18:17.820\n studies.\n\n2:18:17.820 --> 2:18:22.580\n Now, this was very complicated, expensive research.\n\n2:18:22.580 --> 2:18:24.500\n We didn't really have funding to do this.\n\n2:18:24.500 --> 2:18:26.260\n We were trying to do it on the fly.\n\n2:18:26.260 --> 2:18:29.660\n I'm not sure anybody has pursued this.\n\n2:18:29.660 --> 2:18:31.740\n I'm retired now.\n\n2:18:31.740 --> 2:18:34.100\n He's gone on to other things.\n\n2:18:34.100 --> 2:18:41.020\n But I think it's an area of research that would be fascinating to see the parts, a lot\n\n2:18:41.020 --> 2:18:43.140\n more imaging studies now of consciousness.\n\n2:18:43.140 --> 2:18:45.260\n I'm just not up on them.\n\n2:18:45.260 --> 2:18:52.460\n But basically the question is which imaging, so newer imaging studies to see in high resolution,\n\n2:18:52.460 --> 2:18:59.260\n spatial and temporal way, which part of the brain lights up when you're doing intelligence\n\n2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:03.700\n tasks and which parts of the brain lights up when you're doing consciousness tasks and\n\n2:19:03.700 --> 2:19:09.460\n see the interplay between them, try to infer, that's the challenge of neuroscience, without\n\n2:19:09.460 --> 2:19:18.260\n understanding deeply, looking from the outside, try to infer something about how the whole\n\n2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:19.260\n thing works.\n\n2:19:19.260 --> 2:19:21.220\n Well, imagine this.\n\n2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:23.160\n Here's a simple question.\n\n2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:33.460\n Does it take more anesthetic drug to have a person lose consciousness if their IQ is\n\n2:19:33.460 --> 2:19:39.060\n 140 than a person with an IQ of 70?\n\n2:19:39.060 --> 2:19:40.660\n That's an interesting way to study it.\n\n2:19:40.660 --> 2:19:41.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:41.660 --> 2:19:48.060\n I mean, if the answer to that is a stable yes, that's very interesting.\n\n2:19:48.060 --> 2:19:55.700\n So I tried to find out and I went to some anesthesiology textbooks about how you dose\n\n2:19:55.700 --> 2:19:59.620\n and they dose by weight.\n\n2:19:59.620 --> 2:20:07.440\n And what I also learned, this is a little bit off subject, anesthesiologists are never\n\n2:20:07.440 --> 2:20:10.980\n sure how deep you are.\n\n2:20:10.980 --> 2:20:14.780\n And they usually tell by poking you with a needle and if you don't jump, they tell the\n\n2:20:14.780 --> 2:20:17.100\n surgeon to go ahead.\n\n2:20:17.100 --> 2:20:20.460\n I'm not sure that's literally true, but it's...\n\n2:20:20.460 --> 2:20:26.380\n Well, it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are.\n\n2:20:26.380 --> 2:20:31.860\n It has to do with the same kind of measurements that you were doing with the consciousness.\n\n2:20:31.860 --> 2:20:34.740\n It's difficult to know.\n\n2:20:34.740 --> 2:20:35.940\n So I don't lose my train of thought.\n\n2:20:35.940 --> 2:20:40.980\n I couldn't find in the textbooks anything about dosing by intelligence.\n\n2:20:40.980 --> 2:20:45.620\n I asked my friend, the anesthesiologist, he said, no, he doesn't know.\n\n2:20:45.620 --> 2:20:52.220\n I said, can we do a chart review and look at people using their years of education as\n\n2:20:52.220 --> 2:20:54.420\n a proxy for IQ?\n\n2:20:54.420 --> 2:20:58.340\n Because if someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something.\n\n2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:02.780\n You can make some inference as opposed to someone who didn't graduate high school.\n\n2:21:02.780 --> 2:21:03.980\n Can we do a chart review?\n\n2:21:03.980 --> 2:21:08.460\n And he says, no, they never really put down the exact dose.\n\n2:21:08.460 --> 2:21:10.620\n And no, he said, no.\n\n2:21:10.620 --> 2:21:18.820\n So to this day, the simple question, does it take more anesthetic drug to put someone\n\n2:21:18.820 --> 2:21:23.440\n under if they have a high IQ or less, or less?\n\n2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:24.440\n It could go either way.\n\n2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:33.780\n Because by the way, our early PET scan studies of intelligence found the unexpected result\n\n2:21:33.780 --> 2:21:38.540\n of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic rate and intelligence.\n\n2:21:38.540 --> 2:21:43.020\n It wasn't how much a brain area lit up.\n\n2:21:43.020 --> 2:21:48.380\n How much it lit up was negatively correlated to how well they did on the test, which led\n\n2:21:48.380 --> 2:21:54.140\n to the brain efficiency hypothesis, which is still being studied today.\n\n2:21:54.140 --> 2:22:00.280\n And there's more and more evidence that the efficiency of brain information processing\n\n2:22:00.280 --> 2:22:08.780\n is more related to intelligence than just more activity.\n\n2:22:08.780 --> 2:22:14.180\n Yeah, and it'll be interesting, again, this is the total hypothesis, how much in the relationship\n\n2:22:14.180 --> 2:22:22.060\n between intelligence and consciousness, it's not obvious that those two, if there's correlation,\n\n2:22:22.060 --> 2:22:23.860\n they could be inversely correlated.\n\n2:22:23.860 --> 2:22:26.060\n Wouldn't that be funny?\n\n2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:38.340\n If you, the consciousness factor, the C factor plus the G factor equals one.\n\n2:22:38.340 --> 2:22:43.420\n It's a nice trade off, you get a trade off, how deeply you experience the world versus\n\n2:22:43.420 --> 2:22:48.140\n how deeply you're able to reason through the world.\n\n2:22:48.140 --> 2:22:51.060\n What a great hypothesis.\n\n2:22:51.060 --> 2:22:54.140\n Certainly somebody listening to this can do this study.\n\n2:22:54.140 --> 2:22:59.740\n Even if it's the aliens analyzing humans a few centuries from now, let me ask you from\n\n2:22:59.740 --> 2:23:08.600\n an AI perspective, I don't know how much you've thought about machines, but there's the famous\n\n2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:17.220\n Turing test, test of intelligence for machines, which is a beautiful, almost like a cute formulation\n\n2:23:17.220 --> 2:23:24.220\n of intelligence that Alan Turing proposed.\n\n2:23:24.220 --> 2:23:33.420\n Basically conversation being, if you can fool a human to think that a machine is a human\n\n2:23:33.420 --> 2:23:40.620\n that passes the test, I suppose you could do a similar thing for humans.\n\n2:23:40.620 --> 2:23:48.700\n If I can fool you that I'm intelligent, then that's a good test of intelligence.\n\n2:23:48.700 --> 2:24:02.500\n You're talking to two people, and the test is saying who has a higher IQ.\n\n2:24:02.500 --> 2:24:07.960\n It's an interesting test, because maybe charisma can be very useful there, and you're only\n\n2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:11.340\n allowed to use conversation, which is the formulation of the Turing test.\n\n2:24:11.340 --> 2:24:18.700\n Anyway, all that to say is what are good tests of intelligence for machines?\n\n2:24:18.700 --> 2:24:23.700\n What do you think it takes to achieve human level intelligence for machines?\n\n2:24:23.700 --> 2:24:30.760\n I have thought a little bit about this, but every time I think about these things, I rapidly\n\n2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:37.580\n reach the limits of my knowledge and imagination.\n\n2:24:37.580 --> 2:24:47.460\n When Alexa first came out, and I think there was a competing one, well, there was Siri\n\n2:24:47.460 --> 2:24:50.100\n with Apple, and Google had Alexa.\n\n2:24:50.100 --> 2:24:52.660\n No, no, Amazon had Alexa.\n\n2:24:52.660 --> 2:24:53.660\n Amazon had Alexa.\n\n2:24:53.660 --> 2:24:54.660\n Google has Google Home.\n\n2:24:54.660 --> 2:24:55.660\n Google has something.\n\n2:24:55.660 --> 2:25:04.020\n I proposed to one of my colleagues that he buy one of these, one of each, and then ask\n\n2:25:04.020 --> 2:25:09.020\n it questions from the IQ test.\n\n2:25:09.020 --> 2:25:15.860\n But it became apparent that they all searched the internet, so they all can find answers\n\n2:25:15.860 --> 2:25:22.540\n to questions like how far is it between Washington and Miami, and repeat after me.\n\n2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:29.620\n Now, I don't know if you said to Alexa, I'm going to repeat these numbers backwards to\n\n2:25:29.620 --> 2:25:30.620\n me.\n\n2:25:30.620 --> 2:25:31.620\n I don't know what would happen.\n\n2:25:31.620 --> 2:25:33.620\n I've never done it.\n\n2:25:33.620 --> 2:25:38.060\n So one answer to your question is you're going to try it right now.\n\n2:25:38.060 --> 2:25:39.060\n Let's try it.\n\n2:25:39.060 --> 2:25:40.060\n No.\n\n2:25:40.060 --> 2:25:41.060\n Let's try it.\n\n2:25:41.060 --> 2:25:42.060\n No, no, no.\n\n2:25:42.060 --> 2:25:43.060\n Yes, Siri.\n\n2:25:43.060 --> 2:25:47.500\n So it would actually probably go to Google search, and it will be all confusing kind\n\n2:25:47.500 --> 2:25:49.500\n of stuff.\n\n2:25:49.500 --> 2:25:50.500\n It would fail.\n\n2:25:50.500 --> 2:25:53.980\n Well, then I guess there was a test that it would fail.\n\n2:25:53.980 --> 2:26:02.560\n Well, but that's not, that has to do more with the language of communication versus\n\n2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:03.740\n the content.\n\n2:26:03.740 --> 2:26:09.300\n So if you did an IQ test to a person who doesn't speak English, and the test was administered\n\n2:26:09.300 --> 2:26:11.660\n in English, that's not really the test of...\n\n2:26:11.660 --> 2:26:15.740\n Well, let's think about the computers that beat the Jeopardy champions.\n\n2:26:15.740 --> 2:26:21.760\n Yeah, so that, because I happen to know how those are programmed, those are very hard\n\n2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:25.660\n coded, and there's definitely a lack of intelligence there.\n\n2:26:25.660 --> 2:26:36.060\n There's something like IQ tests, there's a guy, an artificial intelligence researcher,\n\n2:26:36.060 --> 2:26:40.980\n Francois Chollet, he's at Google, he's one of the seminal people in machine learning.\n\n2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:45.860\n He also, as a fun aside thing, developed an IQ test for machines.\n\n2:26:45.860 --> 2:26:47.660\n Oh, I haven't heard that.\n\n2:26:47.660 --> 2:26:49.580\n I'd just like to know about that.\n\n2:26:49.580 --> 2:26:53.340\n I'll actually email you this, because it'd be very interesting for you.\n\n2:26:53.340 --> 2:26:59.900\n It doesn't get much attention, because people don't know what to do with it, but it deserves\n\n2:26:59.900 --> 2:27:06.180\n a lot of attention, which is, it basically does a pattern type of tests, where you have\n\n2:27:06.180 --> 2:27:12.740\n to do, you know, one standard one is, you're given three things, and you have to do a fourth\n\n2:27:12.740 --> 2:27:17.120\n one, that kind of thing, so you have to understand the pattern here.\n\n2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:28.740\n And for that, it really simplifies to, so the interesting thing is, he's trying not\n\n2:27:28.740 --> 2:27:35.300\n to achieve high IQ, he's trying to achieve like, pretty low bar for IQ.\n\n2:27:35.300 --> 2:27:42.060\n Things that are kind of trivial for humans, and they're actually really tough for machines.\n\n2:27:42.060 --> 2:27:49.420\n It's just seeing, playing with these concepts of symmetry, of counting, like if I give you\n\n2:27:49.420 --> 2:27:54.980\n one object, two objects, three objects, you'll know the last one is four objects, you can\n\n2:27:54.980 --> 2:28:01.300\n like count them, you can cluster objects together, it's both visually and conceptually, we can\n\n2:28:01.300 --> 2:28:07.420\n do all these things with our mind, that we take for granted, the objectness of things.\n\n2:28:07.420 --> 2:28:14.740\n You can like, figure out what spatially is an object and isn't, and we can play with\n\n2:28:14.740 --> 2:28:21.540\n those ideas, and machines really struggle with that, so he really cleanly formulated\n\n2:28:21.540 --> 2:28:27.340\n these IQ tests, I wonder what like, that would equate to for humans with IQ, but it'd be\n\n2:28:27.340 --> 2:28:33.940\n a very low IQ, but that's exactly the kind of formulation, like okay, we want to be able\n\n2:28:33.940 --> 2:28:38.060\n to solve this, how do we solve this, and he does it as a challenge, and nobody's been\n\n2:28:38.060 --> 2:28:44.260\n able to, it's similar to the Alexa prize, which is Amazon is hosting a conversational\n\n2:28:44.260 --> 2:28:51.440\n challenge, nobody's been able to do well on his, but that's an interesting, those kinds\n\n2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:58.500\n of tests are interesting, because we take for granted all the ability of the human mind\n\n2:28:58.500 --> 2:29:08.620\n to play with concepts, and to formulate concepts out of novel things, so like, things we've\n\n2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:14.440\n never seen before, we're able to use that, I mean that's, I've talked to a few people\n\n2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:20.540\n that design IQ tests, sort of online, they write IQ tests, and I was trying to get some\n\n2:29:20.540 --> 2:29:25.180\n questions from them, and they spoke to the fact that we can't really share questions\n\n2:29:25.180 --> 2:29:31.980\n with you, because part of the, like first of all, it's really hard work to come up with\n\n2:29:31.980 --> 2:29:37.240\n questions, it's really, really hard work, it takes a lot of research, but it also takes\n\n2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:46.060\n a lot, it's novelty generating, you're constantly coming up with really new things, and part\n\n2:29:46.060 --> 2:29:51.380\n of the point is that they're not supposed to be public, they're supposed to be new\n\n2:29:51.380 --> 2:29:56.700\n to you when you look at them, it's interesting that the novelty is fundamental to the hardness\n\n2:29:56.700 --> 2:30:02.320\n of the problem, at least a part of what makes the problem hard is that you've never seen\n\n2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:03.320\n it before.\n\n2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:08.860\n Right, that's called fluid intelligence, as opposed to what's called crystallized intelligence,\n\n2:30:08.860 --> 2:30:16.200\n which is your knowledge of facts, you know things, but can you use those things to solve\n\n2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:19.500\n a problem, those are two different things.\n\n2:30:19.500 --> 2:30:25.180\n Do you think we'll be able to, because we spoke, I don't want to miss opportunity to\n\n2:30:25.180 --> 2:30:30.300\n talk about this, we spoke about the neurobiology, about the molecular biology of intelligence,\n\n2:30:30.300 --> 2:30:39.460\n do you think one day we'll be able to modify the biology of, or the genetics of a person\n\n2:30:39.460 --> 2:30:45.040\n to modify their intelligence, to increase their intelligence, we started this conversation\n\n2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:49.020\n by talking about a pill you could take, do you think that such a pill would exist?\n\n2:30:49.020 --> 2:30:57.900\n Metaphorically, I do, and I am supremely confident that it's possible because I am supremely\n\n2:30:57.900 --> 2:31:07.220\n ignorant of the complexities of neurobiology, and so I have written that the nightmares\n\n2:31:07.220 --> 2:31:15.860\n of neurobiologists, understanding the complexities, this cascade of events that happens at the\n\n2:31:15.860 --> 2:31:25.060\n synaptic level, that these nightmares are what fuel some people to solve.\n\n2:31:25.060 --> 2:31:31.520\n So some people, you have to be undaunted, I mean yeah, this is not easy, look we're\n\n2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:38.660\n still trying to figure out cancer, it was only recently that they figured out why aspirin\n\n2:31:38.660 --> 2:31:47.980\n works, you know, these are not easy problems, but I also have the perspective of the history\n\n2:31:47.980 --> 2:31:57.580\n of science, is the history of solving problems that are extraordinarily complex.\n\n2:31:57.580 --> 2:31:58.740\n And seem impossible at the time.\n\n2:31:58.740 --> 2:32:01.140\n And seem impossible at the time.\n\n2:32:01.140 --> 2:32:08.460\n And so one of the things you look at, at companies like Neuralink, you have brain computer interfaces,\n\n2:32:08.460 --> 2:32:12.500\n you start to delve into the human mind and start to talk about machines measuring but\n\n2:32:12.500 --> 2:32:19.180\n also sending signals to the human mind, and you start to wonder what that has, what impact\n\n2:32:19.180 --> 2:32:23.700\n that has on the G factor.\n\n2:32:23.700 --> 2:32:32.420\n Modifying in small ways or in large ways the functioning, the mechanical, electrical, chemical\n\n2:32:32.420 --> 2:32:34.140\n functioning of the brain.\n\n2:32:34.140 --> 2:32:39.860\n I look at everything about the brain, there are different levels of explanation.\n\n2:32:39.860 --> 2:32:46.420\n On one hand you have a behavioral level, but then you have brain circuitry, and then you\n\n2:32:46.420 --> 2:32:57.380\n have neurons, and then you have dendrites, and then you have synapses, and then you have\n\n2:32:57.380 --> 2:33:06.580\n the neurotransmitters, and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals, and then you\n\n2:33:06.580 --> 2:33:13.980\n have all the things that influence neurotransmitters, and then you have the individual differences\n\n2:33:13.980 --> 2:33:15.460\n among people.\n\n2:33:15.460 --> 2:33:27.540\n Yeah, it's complicated, but 51 million people in the United States have IQs under 85 and\n\n2:33:27.540 --> 2:33:32.540\n struggle with everyday life.\n\n2:33:32.540 --> 2:33:37.140\n Shouldn't that motivate people to take a look at this?\n\n2:33:37.140 --> 2:33:46.220\n Yeah, but I just want to linger one more time that you have to remember that the science\n\n2:33:46.220 --> 2:33:54.740\n of intelligence, the measure of intelligence is only a part of the human condition.\n\n2:33:54.740 --> 2:33:59.260\n The thing that makes life beautiful and the creation of beautiful things in this world\n\n2:33:59.260 --> 2:34:08.860\n is perhaps loosely correlated, but is not dependent entirely on intelligence.\n\n2:34:08.860 --> 2:34:12.220\n Absolutely, I certainly agree with that.\n\n2:34:12.220 --> 2:34:22.660\n So for anyone sort of listening, I'm still not convinced that more intelligence is always\n\n2:34:22.660 --> 2:34:26.060\n better if you want to create beauty in this world.\n\n2:34:26.060 --> 2:34:27.060\n I don't know.\n\n2:34:27.060 --> 2:34:31.340\n Well, I didn't say more intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty.\n\n2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:36.460\n I just said all things being equal, more is better than less.\n\n2:34:36.460 --> 2:34:37.460\n That's all I mean.\n\n2:34:37.460 --> 2:34:42.980\n Yeah, but that's sort of that I just want to sort of say because a lot to me, one of\n\n2:34:42.980 --> 2:34:50.380\n the things that makes life great is the opportunity to create beautiful things, and so I just\n\n2:34:50.380 --> 2:34:56.380\n want to sort of empower people to do that no matter what some IQ test says.\n\n2:34:56.380 --> 2:35:02.420\n At the population level, we do need to look at IQ tests to help people and to also inspire\n\n2:35:02.420 --> 2:35:07.900\n us to take on some of these extremely difficult scientific questions.\n\n2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:16.860\n Do you have advice for young people in high school, in college, whether they're thinking\n\n2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:20.740\n about career or they're thinking about a life they can be proud of?\n\n2:35:20.740 --> 2:35:29.760\n Is there advice you can give whether they want to pursue psychology or biology or engineering\n\n2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:33.700\n or they want to be artists and musicians and poets?\n\n2:35:33.700 --> 2:35:43.320\n I can't advise anybody on that level of what their passion is, but I can say if you're\n\n2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:52.840\n interested in psychology or if you're interested in science and the science around the big\n\n2:35:52.840 --> 2:36:00.640\n questions of consciousness and intelligence and psychiatric illness, we haven't really\n\n2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:07.020\n talked about brain illnesses and what we might learn from.\n\n2:36:07.020 --> 2:36:12.540\n If you are trying to develop a drug to treat Alzheimer's disease, you are trying to develop\n\n2:36:12.540 --> 2:36:20.420\n a drug to impact learning and memory, which are core to intelligence.\n\n2:36:20.420 --> 2:36:26.100\n So it could well be that the so called IQ pill will come from a pharmaceutical company\n\n2:36:26.100 --> 2:36:29.460\n trying to develop a drug for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n2:36:29.460 --> 2:36:33.540\n Because that's exactly what you're trying to do, right, yeah, just like you said.\n\n2:36:33.540 --> 2:36:38.460\n What will that drug do in a college student that doesn't have Alzheimer's disease?\n\n2:36:38.460 --> 2:36:47.740\n So I would encourage people who are interested in psychology, who are interested in science\n\n2:36:47.740 --> 2:36:54.300\n to pursue a scientific career and address the big questions.\n\n2:36:54.300 --> 2:37:03.080\n And the most important thing I can tell you if you're going to be in kind of a research\n\n2:37:03.080 --> 2:37:07.420\n environment is you got to follow the data where the data take you.\n\n2:37:07.420 --> 2:37:10.700\n You can't decide in advance where you want the data to go.\n\n2:37:10.700 --> 2:37:16.300\n And if the data take you to places that you don't have the technical expertise to follow,\n\n2:37:16.300 --> 2:37:21.940\n like you know, I would like to understand more about molecular biology, but I'm not\n\n2:37:21.940 --> 2:37:24.940\n going to become a molecular biologist now.\n\n2:37:24.940 --> 2:37:31.140\n But I know people who are, and my job is to get them interested to take their expertise\n\n2:37:31.140 --> 2:37:33.640\n into this direction.\n\n2:37:33.640 --> 2:37:36.580\n And that it's not so easy.\n\n2:37:36.580 --> 2:37:41.820\n And if the data takes you to a place that's controversial, that's counterintuitive in\n\n2:37:41.820 --> 2:37:52.460\n this world, no, I would say it's probably a good idea to still push forward boldly,\n\n2:37:52.460 --> 2:38:01.380\n but to communicate the interpretation of the results with skill, with compassion, with\n\n2:38:01.380 --> 2:38:07.700\n the greater breadth of understanding of humanity, not just the science, of the impact of the\n\n2:38:07.700 --> 2:38:08.900\n results.\n\n2:38:08.900 --> 2:38:16.340\n One famous psychologist wrote about this issue that somehow a balance has to be found between\n\n2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:22.260\n pursuing the science and communicating it with respect to people's sensitivities, the\n\n2:38:22.260 --> 2:38:26.020\n legitimate sensitivities, somehow.\n\n2:38:26.020 --> 2:38:27.020\n He didn't say how.\n\n2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:28.020\n Somehow.\n\n2:38:28.020 --> 2:38:29.020\n Somehow.\n\n2:38:29.020 --> 2:38:30.020\n And this is...\n\n2:38:30.020 --> 2:38:37.500\n This sense, somehow, and balance is left up to the interpretation of the reader.\n\n2:38:37.500 --> 2:38:44.220\n Let me ask you, you said big questions, the biggest, or one of the biggest, we already\n\n2:38:44.220 --> 2:38:48.060\n talked about consciousness and intelligence, one of the most fascinating, one of the biggest\n\n2:38:48.060 --> 2:38:49.060\n questions.\n\n2:38:49.060 --> 2:38:51.420\n But let's talk about the why.\n\n2:38:51.420 --> 2:38:53.420\n Why are we here?\n\n2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:54.420\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n2:38:54.420 --> 2:38:55.420\n I'm not going to tell you.\n\n2:38:55.420 --> 2:38:56.420\n You know you're not going to tell me?\n\n2:38:56.420 --> 2:39:00.940\n This is very...\n\n2:39:00.940 --> 2:39:03.420\n I'm going to have to wait for your next book.\n\n2:39:03.420 --> 2:39:07.260\n The meaning of life.\n\n2:39:07.260 --> 2:39:12.700\n We do the best we can to get through the day.\n\n2:39:12.700 --> 2:39:16.140\n And then there's just a finite number of the days.\n\n2:39:16.140 --> 2:39:17.820\n Are you afraid of the finiteness of it?\n\n2:39:17.820 --> 2:39:21.140\n I think about it more and more as I get older.\n\n2:39:21.140 --> 2:39:23.940\n Yeah, I do.\n\n2:39:23.940 --> 2:39:30.900\n And it's one of these human things, that it is finite, we all know it.\n\n2:39:30.900 --> 2:39:35.980\n Most of us deny it and don't want to think about it.\n\n2:39:35.980 --> 2:39:42.460\n Sometimes you think about it in terms of estate planning, you try to do the rational thing.\n\n2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:46.900\n Sometimes it makes you work harder because you know your time is more and more limited\n\n2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:50.740\n and you want to get things done.\n\n2:39:50.740 --> 2:39:53.700\n I don't know where I am on that.\n\n2:39:53.700 --> 2:40:00.860\n It is just one of those things that's always in the back of my mind.\n\n2:40:00.860 --> 2:40:02.540\n And I don't think that's uncommon.\n\n2:40:02.540 --> 2:40:09.420\n Well it's just like G factor and intelligence, it's a hard truth that's there.\n\n2:40:09.420 --> 2:40:15.100\n And sometimes you kind of walk past it and you don't want to look at it, but it's still\n\n2:40:15.100 --> 2:40:16.100\n there.\n\n2:40:16.100 --> 2:40:17.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:17.100 --> 2:40:20.180\n Yes, you can't escape it.\n\n2:40:20.180 --> 2:40:28.220\n And the thing about the G factor and intelligence is everybody knows this is true on a personal\n\n2:40:28.220 --> 2:40:31.020\n daily basis.\n\n2:40:31.020 --> 2:40:39.060\n Even if you think back to when you were in school, you know who the smart kids were.\n\n2:40:39.060 --> 2:40:44.820\n When you are on the phone talking to a customer service representative, that in response to\n\n2:40:44.820 --> 2:40:52.860\n your detailed question is reading a script back to you and you get furious at this.\n\n2:40:52.860 --> 2:40:56.920\n Have you ever called this person a moron or wanted to call this person a moron?\n\n2:40:56.920 --> 2:40:58.820\n You're not listening to me.\n\n2:40:58.820 --> 2:41:03.380\n Everybody has had the experience of dealing with people who they think are not at their\n\n2:41:03.380 --> 2:41:05.260\n level.\n\n2:41:05.260 --> 2:41:09.460\n It's just common because that's the way human beings are.\n\n2:41:09.460 --> 2:41:11.140\n That's the way life is.\n\n2:41:11.140 --> 2:41:16.380\n But we also have a poor estimation of our own intelligence.\n\n2:41:16.380 --> 2:41:22.980\n We have a poor, and we're not always a great, our judgment of human character of other people\n\n2:41:22.980 --> 2:41:29.100\n is not as good as a battery of tests.\n\n2:41:29.100 --> 2:41:31.780\n That's where bias comes in.\n\n2:41:31.780 --> 2:41:35.660\n That's where our history, our emotions, all of that comes in.\n\n2:41:35.660 --> 2:41:39.860\n So, you know, people on the internet, you know, there's such a thing as the internet\n\n2:41:39.860 --> 2:41:45.940\n and people on the internet will call each other dumb all the time.\n\n2:41:45.940 --> 2:41:53.060\n You know, that's the worry here is that we give up on people.\n\n2:41:53.060 --> 2:42:00.140\n We put them in a bin just because of one interaction or some small number of interactions as if\n\n2:42:00.140 --> 2:42:01.140\n that's it.\n\n2:42:01.140 --> 2:42:02.140\n They're hopeless.\n\n2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:03.640\n That's just in their genetics.\n\n2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:11.140\n But I think no matter what the science here says, once again, that does not mean we should\n\n2:42:11.140 --> 2:42:15.020\n not have compassion for our fellow man.\n\n2:42:15.020 --> 2:42:17.700\n That's exactly what the science does say.\n\n2:42:17.700 --> 2:42:22.540\n It's not opposite of what the science says.\n\n2:42:22.540 --> 2:42:30.120\n Everything I know about psychology, everything I've learned about intelligence, everything\n\n2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:38.220\n points to the inexorable conclusion that you have to treat people as individuals respectfully\n\n2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:40.060\n and with compassion.\n\n2:42:40.060 --> 2:42:46.780\n Because through no fault of their own, some people are not as capable as others.\n\n2:42:46.780 --> 2:42:52.220\n And you want to turn a blind eye to it, you want to come up with theories about why that\n\n2:42:52.220 --> 2:42:54.300\n might be true, fine.\n\n2:42:54.300 --> 2:42:58.060\n I would like to fix some of it as best I can.\n\n2:42:58.060 --> 2:43:01.860\n And everybody is deserving of love.\n\n2:43:01.860 --> 2:43:05.340\n Richard, this is a good way to end it, I think.\n\n2:43:05.340 --> 2:43:07.500\n I'm just getting warmed up here.\n\n2:43:07.500 --> 2:43:08.500\n I know.\n\n2:43:08.500 --> 2:43:15.220\n I know you can go for another many hours, but to respect your extremely valuable time,\n\n2:43:15.220 --> 2:43:16.780\n this is an amazing conversation.\n\n2:43:16.780 --> 2:43:23.900\n Thank you for the teaching company, the lectures you've given with the New York Science of\n\n2:43:23.900 --> 2:43:24.900\n Intelligence.\n\n2:43:24.900 --> 2:43:29.700\n Thank you for everything you're doing, it's a difficult topic, it's a topic that's controversial\n\n2:43:29.700 --> 2:43:35.820\n and sensitive to people and to push forward boldly and in that nuanced way, just thank\n\n2:43:35.820 --> 2:43:37.060\n you for everything you do.\n\n2:43:37.060 --> 2:43:42.260\n And thank you for asking the big questions of intelligence, of consciousness.\n\n2:43:42.260 --> 2:43:43.500\n Well thank you for asking me.\n\n2:43:43.500 --> 2:43:47.660\n I mean, there's nothing like good conversation on these topics.\n\n2:43:47.660 --> 2:43:50.100\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Haier.\n\n2:43:50.100 --> 2:43:54.540\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:43:54.540 --> 2:43:57.620\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.\n\n2:43:57.620 --> 2:44:04.460\n It is not that I'm so smart, but I stay with the questions much longer.\n\n2:44:04.460 --> 2:44:25.580\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
