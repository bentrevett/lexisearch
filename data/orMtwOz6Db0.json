00:07.020\n at University of Oxford.\n\n00:07.020 --> 00:10.860\n He has made fundamental contributions in many disciplines\n\n00:10.860 --> 00:13.340\n from the mathematical physics of general relativity\n\n00:13.340 --> 00:15.780\n and cosmology to the limitations\n\n00:15.780 --> 00:18.660\n of a computational view of consciousness.\n\n00:18.660 --> 00:20.820\n In his book, The Emperor's New Mind,\n\n00:20.820 --> 00:22.820\n Roger writes that, quote,\n\n00:22.820 --> 00:26.160\n \"'Children are not afraid to pose basic questions\n\n00:26.160 --> 00:29.900\n that may embarrass us as adults to ask.'\n\n00:29.900 --> 00:32.000\n In many ways, my goal with this podcast\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:33.680\n is to embrace the inner child\n\n00:33.680 --> 00:36.540\n that is not constrained by how one should behave,\n\n00:36.540 --> 00:40.100\n speak, and think in the adult world.\n\n00:41.180 --> 00:44.780\n Roger is one of the most important minds of our time,\n\n00:44.780 --> 00:48.300\n so it was truly a pleasure and an honor to talk with him.\n\n00:49.140 --> 00:50.620\n This conversation was recorded\n\n00:50.620 --> 00:52.920\n before the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n00:52.920 --> 00:55.820\n For everyone feeling the medical, psychological,\n\n00:55.820 --> 00:57.740\n and financial burden of the crisis,\n\n00:57.740 --> 00:59.780\n I'm sending love your way.\n\n00:59.780 --> 01:03.060\n Stay strong, we're in this together, we'll beat this thing.\n\n01:04.100 --> 01:06.660\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:06.660 --> 01:08.860\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:08.860 --> 01:11.220\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n01:11.220 --> 01:12.620\n support it on Patreon,\n\n01:12.620 --> 01:14.660\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:14.660 --> 01:18.780\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:18.780 --> 01:21.180\n As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now\n\n01:21.180 --> 01:22.380\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n01:22.380 --> 01:24.580\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:24.580 --> 01:25.720\n I hope that works for you\n\n01:25.720 --> 01:27.860\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n01:27.860 --> 01:29.340\n Quick summary of the ads.\n\n01:29.340 --> 01:33.380\n Two sponsors, ExpressVPN and Cash App.\n\n01:33.380 --> 01:35.500\n Please consider supporting the podcast\n\n01:35.500 --> 01:40.500\n by getting ExpressVPN at expressvpn.com slash lexpod\n\n01:40.900 --> 01:45.900\n and downloading Cash App and using code LEX PODCAST.\n\n01:46.260 --> 01:48.260\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:48.260 --> 01:50.460\n the number one finance app in the app store.\n\n01:50.460 --> 01:53.540\n When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.\n\n01:53.540 --> 01:55.660\n Cash App lets you send money to friends,\n\n01:55.660 --> 01:58.020\n buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market\n\n01:58.020 --> 01:59.940\n with as little as $1.\n\n01:59.940 --> 02:02.220\n Since Cash App does fractional share trading,\n\n02:02.220 --> 02:05.060\n let me mention that the order execution algorithm\n\n02:05.060 --> 02:06.780\n that works behind the scenes\n\n02:06.780 --> 02:09.460\n to create the abstraction of the fractional orders\n\n02:09.460 --> 02:11.260\n is an algorithmic marvel.\n\n02:11.260 --> 02:13.740\n So big props to the Cash App engineers\n\n02:13.740 --> 02:15.460\n for solving a hard problem\n\n02:15.460 --> 02:18.040\n that in the end provides an easy interface\n\n02:18.040 --> 02:21.040\n that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction\n\n02:21.040 --> 02:22.980\n over the stock market,\n\n02:22.980 --> 02:25.460\n making trading more accessible for new investors\n\n02:25.460 --> 02:28.480\n and diversification much easier.\n\n02:28.480 --> 02:30.900\n So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store\n\n02:30.900 --> 02:34.340\n or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST,\n\n02:34.340 --> 02:38.500\n you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n02:38.500 --> 02:41.180\n an organization that is helping to advance robotics\n\n02:41.180 --> 02:44.260\n and STEM education for young people around the world.\n\n02:45.120 --> 02:47.700\n This show is sponsored by ExpressVPN.\n\n02:47.700 --> 02:52.540\n Get it at expressvpn.com slash lexpod\n\n02:52.540 --> 02:55.580\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n02:55.580 --> 02:58.280\n I've been using ExpressVPN for many years.\n\n02:58.280 --> 02:59.300\n I love it.\n\n02:59.300 --> 03:03.100\n It's easy to use, press the big power on button\n\n03:03.100 --> 03:04.900\n and your privacy is protected.\n\n03:04.900 --> 03:08.340\n And if you like, you can make it look like your location\n\n03:08.340 --> 03:10.100\n is anywhere else in the world.\n\n03:10.100 --> 03:12.040\n I might be in Boston now,\n\n03:12.040 --> 03:14.220\n but I can make it look like I'm in New York,\n\n03:14.220 --> 03:17.720\n London, Paris or anywhere else.\n\n03:17.720 --> 03:20.380\n This has a large number of obvious benefits.\n\n03:20.380 --> 03:23.300\n Certainly, it allows you to access international versions\n\n03:23.300 --> 03:26.140\n of streaming websites like the Japanese Netflix\n\n03:26.140 --> 03:28.140\n or the UK Hulu.\n\n03:28.140 --> 03:31.660\n ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.\n\n03:31.660 --> 03:36.320\n I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android,\n\n03:36.320 --> 03:38.640\n but it's available everywhere else too.\n\n03:38.640 --> 03:43.380\n Once again, get it at expressvpn.com slash lexpod\n\n03:43.380 --> 03:46.440\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n03:46.440 --> 03:50.640\n And now, here's my conversation with Roger Penrose.\n\n03:51.660 --> 03:54.240\n You mentioned in conversation with Eric Weinstein\n\n03:54.240 --> 03:57.620\n on the Portal podcast that 2001 Space Odyssey\n\n03:57.620 --> 03:58.980\n is your favorite movie.\n\n03:59.940 --> 04:02.100\n Which aspect, if you could mention,\n\n04:02.100 --> 04:05.100\n of its representation of artificial intelligence,\n\n04:05.100 --> 04:07.740\n science, engineering connected with you?\n\n04:07.740 --> 04:11.460\n There are all sorts of scenes there which are so amazing.\n\n04:11.460 --> 04:14.820\n And how science was so well done.\n\n04:14.820 --> 04:19.060\n I mean, people say, oh no, Interstellar is this amazing movie\n\n04:19.060 --> 04:21.700\n which is the most scientific movie.\n\n04:21.700 --> 04:23.780\n I thought it's not a patch on 2001.\n\n04:24.660 --> 04:29.260\n I mean, 2001, they really went into all sorts of details.\n\n04:29.260 --> 04:33.220\n And regarding getting the free fall well done and everything,\n\n04:33.220 --> 04:35.940\n I thought it was extremely well done.\n\n04:35.940 --> 04:38.980\n So just the details were mesmerizing in terms of this.\n\n04:38.980 --> 04:43.180\n And also things like the scene where at the beginning\n\n04:43.180 --> 04:45.700\n they have these sort of human ancestors\n\n04:45.700 --> 04:49.540\n which are sort of apes becoming humans.\n\n04:49.540 --> 04:50.820\n The monolith.\n\n04:50.820 --> 04:53.900\n Yes, and well, it's the one where he throws the bone\n\n04:53.900 --> 04:56.300\n up into the air and then it becomes this.\n\n04:57.220 --> 05:00.140\n I mean, that's an amazing sequence there.\n\n05:00.140 --> 05:01.860\n What do you make of the monolith?\n\n05:01.860 --> 05:06.140\n Does it have any scientific or philosophical meaning to you,\n\n05:06.140 --> 05:08.220\n this kind of thing that sparks innovation?\n\n05:08.220 --> 05:09.060\n Not really.\n\n05:09.060 --> 05:12.260\n That comes from Arthur C. Clarke.\n\n05:12.260 --> 05:14.220\n I was always a great fan of Arthur C. Clarke.\n\n05:14.220 --> 05:16.020\n So it's just a nice plot device.\n\n05:16.020 --> 05:18.140\n Yeah, that plot is excellent, yes.\n\n05:18.140 --> 05:22.020\n So Hal 9000 decides to get rid of the astronauts\n\n05:22.020 --> 05:26.900\n because he, it, she believes that they will interfere\n\n05:26.900 --> 05:27.740\n with the mission.\n\n05:27.740 --> 05:28.580\n That's right.\n\n05:28.580 --> 05:29.420\n Yeah, well, there you are.\n\n05:29.420 --> 05:30.380\n It's this view.\n\n05:30.380 --> 05:31.580\n I don't know whether I disagree with it\n\n05:31.580 --> 05:35.180\n because in a certain sense it was telling you it's wrong.\n\n05:35.180 --> 05:39.460\n See, the machine seemed to think it was superior\n\n05:39.460 --> 05:44.460\n to the human and so it was entitled to get rid\n\n05:45.060 --> 05:47.380\n of the human beings and run the show itself.\n\n05:47.380 --> 05:49.460\n Well, do you think Hal did the right thing?\n\n05:49.460 --> 05:52.020\n Do you think Hal's flawed evil?\n\n05:52.020 --> 05:55.340\n Or if we think about systems like Hal,\n\n05:55.340 --> 05:58.020\n would we want Hal to do the same thing in the future?\n\n05:58.020 --> 05:58.940\n What was the flaw there?\n\n05:58.940 --> 06:01.660\n Well, you're basically touching on questions.\n\n06:01.660 --> 06:04.540\n You see, it's one supposed to believe\n\n06:04.540 --> 06:06.420\n that Hal was actually conscious.\n\n06:06.420 --> 06:10.140\n I mean, it was played rather that way,\n\n06:10.140 --> 06:13.500\n as though Hal was a conscious being.\n\n06:13.500 --> 06:18.500\n Because Hal showed some pain, some cognizance,\n\n06:19.820 --> 06:24.180\n Hal appeared to be cognizant of what it means to die.\n\n06:24.180 --> 06:25.020\n Yes.\n\n06:25.020 --> 06:28.220\n And therefore had an inkling of consciousness.\n\n06:28.220 --> 06:30.780\n Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure that aspect\n\n06:30.780 --> 06:32.700\n of it was made completely clear,\n\n06:32.700 --> 06:37.100\n whether Hal was really just a very sophisticated computer,\n\n06:37.100 --> 06:39.300\n which really didn't actually have these feelings\n\n06:39.300 --> 06:42.180\n and somehow, but you're right,\n\n06:42.180 --> 06:44.660\n it didn't like the idea of being turned off.\n\n06:45.620 --> 06:48.780\n How does it change things if Hal was or wasn't conscious?\n\n06:49.700 --> 06:53.100\n Well, it might say that it would be wrong to turn it off\n\n06:53.100 --> 06:55.180\n if it was actually conscious.\n\n06:55.180 --> 06:57.340\n I mean, these questions arise if you think.\n\n06:57.340 --> 07:00.020\n I mean, AI, one of the ideas,\n\n07:00.020 --> 07:01.460\n it's sort of a mixture in a sense.\n\n07:01.460 --> 07:05.260\n You say, if it's trying to do everything a human can do,\n\n07:05.260 --> 07:08.660\n and if you take the view that consciousness\n\n07:08.660 --> 07:10.500\n is something which would come along\n\n07:10.500 --> 07:13.420\n when the computer is sufficiently complicated,\n\n07:13.420 --> 07:16.460\n sufficiently whatever criterion you use\n\n07:16.460 --> 07:20.860\n to characterize its consciousness\n\n07:20.860 --> 07:24.860\n in terms of some computational criteria,\n\n07:24.860 --> 07:27.780\n computational criterion.\n\n07:28.620 --> 07:33.580\n So how does consciousness change our evaluation\n\n07:33.580 --> 07:35.940\n of the decision that Hal made?\n\n07:35.940 --> 07:36.780\n I guess I was trying to say\n\n07:36.780 --> 07:38.940\n that people are a bit confused about this,\n\n07:38.940 --> 07:42.100\n because if they say these machines will become conscious,\n\n07:42.100 --> 07:45.300\n but just simply because it's a degree of computation,\n\n07:45.300 --> 07:48.260\n and when you get beyond that certain degree of computation,\n\n07:48.260 --> 07:49.420\n it will become conscious,\n\n07:49.420 --> 07:52.340\n then of course you have all these problems.\n\n07:52.340 --> 07:53.380\n I mean, you might say, well,\n\n07:53.380 --> 07:55.100\n one of the reasons you're doing AI\n\n07:55.100 --> 07:57.100\n is because you want to send a device\n\n07:57.100 --> 07:59.060\n out to some distant planet,\n\n07:59.060 --> 08:01.180\n and you don't want to send a human out there,\n\n08:01.180 --> 08:02.780\n because then you'd have to bring it back again,\n\n08:02.780 --> 08:04.900\n and that costs you far more\n\n08:04.900 --> 08:07.100\n than just sending it there and leaving it there.\n\n08:07.100 --> 08:10.020\n But if this device is actually a conscious entity,\n\n08:10.020 --> 08:13.060\n then you have to face up to the fact that that's immoral.\n\n08:13.060 --> 08:17.820\n And so the mere fact that you're making some AI device\n\n08:17.820 --> 08:22.820\n and thinking that removes your responsibility to it\n\n08:24.140 --> 08:25.820\n would be incorrect.\n\n08:25.820 --> 08:29.700\n And so this is a sign of flaw in that kind of viewpoint.\n\n08:29.700 --> 08:34.180\n I'm not sure how people who take it very seriously,\n\n08:35.460 --> 08:37.140\n I mean, I had this curious conversation\n\n08:37.140 --> 08:40.780\n with, I'm going to forget names, I'm afraid,\n\n08:40.780 --> 08:43.860\n because this is what happens to me at the wrong moment,\n\n08:43.860 --> 08:45.860\n Hofstadter, Douglas Hofstadter.\n\n08:45.860 --> 08:46.820\n Douglas Hofstadter, yeah.\n\n08:46.820 --> 08:48.860\n And he'd written this book,\n\n08:48.860 --> 08:50.340\n God Will Let You Up, which I liked.\n\n08:50.340 --> 08:52.300\n I thought it was a fantastic book.\n\n08:52.300 --> 08:55.700\n But I didn't agree with his conclusion\n\n08:55.700 --> 08:56.580\n from G\u00f6del's theorem.\n\n08:56.580 --> 08:58.580\n I think he got it wrong, you see.\n\n08:58.580 --> 09:01.220\n Well, I'll just tell you my story, you see,\n\n09:01.220 --> 09:02.700\n because I'd never met him.\n\n09:02.700 --> 09:04.740\n And then I knew I was going to meet him,\n\n09:04.740 --> 09:06.860\n the occasion I realized he was coming in,\n\n09:06.860 --> 09:09.140\n he wanted to talk to me, and I said, that's fine.\n\n09:09.140 --> 09:10.460\n And I thought in my mind,\n\n09:10.460 --> 09:12.620\n well, I'm going to paint him into a corner, you see,\n\n09:12.620 --> 09:15.780\n because I'll use his arguments to convince him\n\n09:15.780 --> 09:19.340\n that certain numbers are conscious.\n\n09:19.340 --> 09:22.620\n Some integers, large enough integers are actually conscious.\n\n09:22.620 --> 09:25.420\n And this was going to be my reductio ad absurdum.\n\n09:25.420 --> 09:26.900\n So I started having this argument with him.\n\n09:26.900 --> 09:28.660\n He simply leapt into the corner.\n\n09:28.660 --> 09:31.020\n He didn't even need to be painted into it.\n\n09:31.020 --> 09:33.900\n He took the view that certain numbers were conscious.\n\n09:33.900 --> 09:35.780\n I thought that was a reductio ad absurdum,\n\n09:35.780 --> 09:37.620\n but he seemed to think it was perfectly\n\n09:37.620 --> 09:38.860\n a reasonable point of view.\n\n09:38.860 --> 09:40.620\n Without the absurdum there.\n\n09:40.620 --> 09:41.540\n Yes.\n\n09:41.540 --> 09:44.580\n Interesting, but the thing you mentioned about how\n\n09:44.580 --> 09:46.940\n is the intuition that a lot of the people,\n\n09:46.940 --> 09:48.900\n at least in the artificial intelligence world,\n\n09:48.900 --> 09:51.500\n had and have, I think.\n\n09:51.500 --> 09:52.700\n They don't make it explicit,\n\n09:52.700 --> 09:56.820\n but that if you increase the power of computation,\n\n09:56.820 --> 09:58.980\n naturally consciousness will emerge.\n\n09:58.980 --> 10:00.300\n Yes, I think that's what they think.\n\n10:00.300 --> 10:01.300\n But basically that's because\n\n10:01.300 --> 10:02.740\n they can't think of anything else.\n\n10:02.740 --> 10:03.580\n Well, that's right.\n\n10:03.580 --> 10:05.340\n And so it's a reasonable thing.\n\n10:05.340 --> 10:06.540\n I mean, you think, what does the brain do?\n\n10:06.540 --> 10:09.140\n Well, it does do a lot of computation.\n\n10:09.140 --> 10:11.540\n I think most of what you actually call computation\n\n10:11.540 --> 10:13.260\n is done by the cerebellum.\n\n10:13.260 --> 10:15.620\n I mean, this is one of the things\n\n10:15.620 --> 10:17.820\n that people don't much mention.\n\n10:17.820 --> 10:19.740\n I mean, I come to this subject from the outside\n\n10:19.740 --> 10:21.860\n and certain things strike me,\n\n10:21.860 --> 10:24.700\n which you hardly ever hear mentioned.\n\n10:24.700 --> 10:28.420\n I mean, you hear mentioned about the left right business.\n\n10:28.420 --> 10:30.340\n They move your right arm,\n\n10:30.340 --> 10:31.900\n that's the left side of the brain\n\n10:31.900 --> 10:34.940\n and so on and all that sort of stuff.\n\n10:34.940 --> 10:36.780\n And it's more than that.\n\n10:36.780 --> 10:40.460\n If you have these plots of different parts of the brain,\n\n10:40.460 --> 10:43.300\n there are two of these things called the homunculi,\n\n10:43.300 --> 10:47.500\n which you see these pictures of a distorted human figure\n\n10:47.500 --> 10:51.420\n and showing different parts of the brain,\n\n10:51.420 --> 10:53.140\n controlling different parts of the body.\n\n10:53.140 --> 10:55.900\n And it's not simply things like,\n\n10:55.900 --> 10:58.020\n okay, the right hand is controlled\n\n10:58.020 --> 11:03.020\n and both sensory and motor on the left side,\n\n11:03.020 --> 11:04.820\n left hand on the right side.\n\n11:04.820 --> 11:05.940\n It's more than that.\n\n11:05.940 --> 11:08.620\n Vision is the back basically,\n\n11:08.620 --> 11:11.020\n your feet at the top.\n\n11:11.020 --> 11:13.060\n And it's as though it's about the worst organization\n\n11:13.060 --> 11:14.820\n you could imagine.\n\n11:14.820 --> 11:17.540\n So it can't just be a mistake in nature.\n\n11:17.540 --> 11:19.460\n There's something going on there.\n\n11:19.460 --> 11:22.660\n And this is made more pronounced\n\n11:22.660 --> 11:25.660\n when you think of the cerebellum.\n\n11:25.660 --> 11:27.540\n The cerebellum has,\n\n11:27.540 --> 11:29.340\n when I was first thinking about these things,\n\n11:29.340 --> 11:32.020\n I was told that it had half as many neurons\n\n11:32.020 --> 11:33.940\n or something like that, comparable.\n\n11:33.940 --> 11:36.500\n And now they tell me it's got far more neurons\n\n11:36.500 --> 11:39.780\n than the cerebrum, and cerebrum is this sort of\n\n11:39.780 --> 11:42.020\n convoluted thing at the top people always talk about.\n\n11:42.020 --> 11:44.220\n Cerebellum is this thing just looks a bit like\n\n11:44.220 --> 11:47.900\n a ball of wool right at the back underneath them.\n\n11:47.900 --> 11:49.460\n It's got more neurons.\n\n11:49.460 --> 11:51.620\n It's got more connections.\n\n11:51.620 --> 11:55.140\n Computationally, it's got much more going on\n\n11:55.140 --> 11:57.100\n than this from the cerebrum.\n\n11:58.420 --> 12:01.380\n But as far as we know, that's slightly controversial,\n\n12:01.380 --> 12:04.820\n the cerebellum is entirely unconscious.\n\n12:04.820 --> 12:07.300\n So the actions, you have a pianist\n\n12:07.300 --> 12:09.020\n who plays an incredible piece of music\n\n12:09.020 --> 12:11.940\n and think of, and he moves his little finger\n\n12:11.940 --> 12:14.140\n into this little key to get it, hit it,\n\n12:14.140 --> 12:15.900\n just the right moment.\n\n12:15.900 --> 12:20.780\n Does he or she consciously will that movement?\n\n12:20.780 --> 12:21.620\n No.\n\n12:23.060 --> 12:24.660\n Okay, the consciousness is coming in.\n\n12:24.660 --> 12:26.060\n It's probably to do with the feeling\n\n12:26.060 --> 12:28.780\n of the piece of music that's being performed\n\n12:28.780 --> 12:31.220\n and that sort of thing, which is going on.\n\n12:31.220 --> 12:35.020\n But the details of what's going on are controlled.\n\n12:35.020 --> 12:37.540\n I would think almost entirely by the cerebellum.\n\n12:38.620 --> 12:40.380\n That's where you have this precision\n\n12:40.380 --> 12:44.020\n and the really detailed.\n\n12:44.020 --> 12:47.260\n Once you get, I mean, you think of a tennis player\n\n12:47.260 --> 12:48.860\n or something, does that tennis player\n\n12:48.860 --> 12:51.940\n think exactly which muscles should be moved\n\n12:51.940 --> 12:52.940\n in what direction and so on?\n\n12:52.940 --> 12:54.380\n No, of course not.\n\n12:54.380 --> 12:56.220\n But he or she will maybe think,\n\n12:56.220 --> 12:59.340\n well, if the ball is angled in such a way in that corner,\n\n12:59.340 --> 13:02.020\n that will be tricky for the opponent.\n\n13:02.020 --> 13:05.060\n And the details of that are all done\n\n13:06.420 --> 13:08.740\n largely with the cerebellum.\n\n13:08.740 --> 13:11.540\n That's where all the precise motions,\n\n13:11.540 --> 13:13.060\n but it's unconscious.\n\n13:13.060 --> 13:14.420\n So why is it interesting to you\n\n13:14.420 --> 13:17.940\n that so much computation is done in the cerebellum\n\n13:17.940 --> 13:19.340\n and yet it is unconscious?\n\n13:19.340 --> 13:21.980\n Because it doesn't, it's the view\n\n13:21.980 --> 13:24.580\n that somehow it's computation\n\n13:24.580 --> 13:27.340\n which is producing the consciousness.\n\n13:27.340 --> 13:30.740\n And it's here you have an incredible amount\n\n13:30.740 --> 13:32.100\n of computation going on.\n\n13:33.220 --> 13:35.820\n And as far as we know, it's completely unconscious.\n\n13:36.980 --> 13:39.460\n So why, what's the difference?\n\n13:39.460 --> 13:41.860\n And I think it's an important thing.\n\n13:41.860 --> 13:42.980\n What's the difference?\n\n13:43.900 --> 13:47.620\n Why is the cerebrum, all this very peculiar stuff\n\n13:47.620 --> 13:51.300\n that very hard to see on a computational perspective,\n\n13:51.300 --> 13:53.940\n like having the, everything have to cross over\n\n13:53.940 --> 13:55.620\n under the other side and do something\n\n13:55.620 --> 13:57.300\n which looks completely inefficient.\n\n13:58.300 --> 14:01.540\n And you've got funny things like the frontal lobe\n\n14:01.540 --> 14:04.660\n and the, what do we call the lobes?\n\n14:04.660 --> 14:06.620\n And the place where they come together,\n\n14:07.820 --> 14:12.340\n you have the different parts, the control,\n\n14:12.340 --> 14:13.740\n you see one to do with motor\n\n14:13.740 --> 14:15.340\n and the other to do with sensory.\n\n14:16.340 --> 14:17.900\n And they're sort of opposite each other\n\n14:17.900 --> 14:19.460\n rather than being connected by,\n\n14:20.860 --> 14:23.460\n it's not as though you've got electrical circuits.\n\n14:23.460 --> 14:26.300\n There's something else going on there.\n\n14:26.300 --> 14:30.260\n So it's just the idea that it's like a complicated computer\n\n14:30.260 --> 14:34.580\n just seems to me to be completely missing the point.\n\n14:34.580 --> 14:37.380\n There must be a lot of computation going on,\n\n14:37.380 --> 14:40.340\n but the cerebellum seems to be much better at doing that\n\n14:40.340 --> 14:41.540\n than the cerebrum is.\n\n14:42.820 --> 14:47.820\n So for sure, I think what explains it is like half hope\n\n14:47.940 --> 14:49.700\n and half we don't know what's going on.\n\n14:49.700 --> 14:52.420\n And therefore from the computer science perspective,\n\n14:52.420 --> 14:56.340\n you hope that a Turing machine can be perfectly,\n\n14:56.340 --> 14:58.020\n can achieve general intelligence.\n\n14:58.020 --> 15:02.220\n Well, you have this wonderful thing about Turing\n\n15:02.220 --> 15:07.220\n and G\u00f6del and Church and Curry and various people,\n\n15:07.500 --> 15:11.660\n particularly Turing, and I guess Post was the other one.\n\n15:11.660 --> 15:14.340\n These people who developed the idea\n\n15:14.340 --> 15:15.880\n of what a computation is.\n\n15:17.740 --> 15:19.900\n And there were different ideas of what a computation,\n\n15:19.900 --> 15:20.740\n developed differently.\n\n15:20.740 --> 15:21.820\n I mean, Church's way of doing it,\n\n15:21.820 --> 15:24.620\n was very different from Turing's,\n\n15:24.620 --> 15:26.820\n but then they were shown to be equivalent.\n\n15:26.820 --> 15:30.860\n And so the view emerged that what we mean by computation\n\n15:32.060 --> 15:33.860\n is a very clear concept.\n\n15:34.820 --> 15:37.860\n And one of the wonderful things that Turing did\n\n15:37.860 --> 15:40.180\n was to show that you could have\n\n15:40.180 --> 15:43.260\n what we call the universal Turing machine.\n\n15:43.260 --> 15:46.300\n It's you just have to have a certain finite device.\n\n15:46.300 --> 15:48.580\n Okay, it has to have an unlimited storage space,\n\n15:48.580 --> 15:50.180\n which is accessible to it,\n\n15:50.180 --> 15:51.960\n but the actual computation, if you like,\n\n15:51.960 --> 15:55.980\n is performed by this one universal device.\n\n15:55.980 --> 15:57.740\n And so the view comes away,\n\n15:57.740 --> 16:01.340\n well, you have this universal Turing machine,\n\n16:01.340 --> 16:03.820\n and maybe the brain is something like that,\n\n16:03.820 --> 16:05.140\n a universal Turing machine,\n\n16:05.140 --> 16:08.620\n and it's got maybe not unlimited storage,\n\n16:08.620 --> 16:12.660\n but a huge storage accessible to it.\n\n16:12.660 --> 16:14.380\n And this model is one,\n\n16:14.380 --> 16:17.380\n which is what's used in ordinary computation.\n\n16:17.380 --> 16:19.260\n It's a very powerful model.\n\n16:19.260 --> 16:24.260\n And the universallness of computation is very useful.\n\n16:24.520 --> 16:26.180\n You could have some problem\n\n16:26.180 --> 16:27.580\n and you may not see immediately\n\n16:27.580 --> 16:29.140\n how to put it onto a computer,\n\n16:29.140 --> 16:32.200\n but if it is something of that nature,\n\n16:32.200 --> 16:36.220\n then there are all sorts of subprograms\n\n16:36.220 --> 16:37.580\n and subroutines when all the,\n\n16:37.580 --> 16:38.940\n I mean, I learned a little bit of computing\n\n16:38.940 --> 16:42.580\n when I was a student, but not very much.\n\n16:42.580 --> 16:45.060\n But it was enough to get the general ideas.\n\n16:45.060 --> 16:46.480\n And there's something really pleasant\n\n16:46.480 --> 16:48.980\n about a formal system like that.\n\n16:48.980 --> 16:49.820\n Yeah.\n\n16:49.820 --> 16:51.420\n Where you can start discussing about what's provable,\n\n16:51.420 --> 16:52.740\n what's not, these kinds of things.\n\n16:52.740 --> 16:55.340\n And you've got a notion, which is an absolute notion,\n\n16:55.340 --> 16:56.820\n this notion of computability,\n\n16:56.820 --> 17:00.260\n and you can address when things are,\n\n17:00.260 --> 17:02.820\n mathematical problems are computably solvable\n\n17:02.820 --> 17:03.660\n and what chance.\n\n17:03.660 --> 17:04.500\n So.\n\n17:04.500 --> 17:06.720\n And it's a very beautiful area of mathematics,\n\n17:06.720 --> 17:09.700\n and it's a very powerful area of mathematics.\n\n17:09.700 --> 17:13.620\n And it underlies the whole sort of,\n\n17:14.580 --> 17:18.500\n I won't say, the principles of computing machines\n\n17:18.500 --> 17:19.700\n that we have today.\n\n17:19.700 --> 17:22.820\n Could you say, what is Gayle's Incompleteness Theorem?\n\n17:22.820 --> 17:24.860\n And how does it, maybe also say,\n\n17:24.860 --> 17:26.500\n is it heartbreaking to you?\n\n17:26.500 --> 17:31.100\n And how does it interfere with this notion of computation\n\n17:31.100 --> 17:32.660\n and consciousness?\n\n17:32.660 --> 17:33.500\n Sure.\n\n17:33.500 --> 17:36.060\n Well, the ideas, basically ideas,\n\n17:36.060 --> 17:39.140\n which I formulated in my first year\n\n17:39.140 --> 17:41.540\n as a graduate student in Cambridge.\n\n17:41.540 --> 17:44.700\n I did my undergraduate work in mathematics in London,\n\n17:44.700 --> 17:47.460\n and I had a colleague, Ian Percival.\n\n17:47.460 --> 17:49.780\n We used to discuss things like computational\n\n17:49.780 --> 17:52.300\n and logical systems quite a lot.\n\n17:52.300 --> 17:53.660\n I'd heard about Gayle's theorem.\n\n17:53.660 --> 17:55.860\n I was a bit worried by the idea that it seemed to say\n\n17:55.860 --> 17:59.620\n there were things in mathematics that you could never prove.\n\n17:59.620 --> 18:03.140\n And so when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student,\n\n18:04.100 --> 18:06.020\n I went to various courses.\n\n18:06.900 --> 18:08.540\n You see, I was doing pure mathematics.\n\n18:08.540 --> 18:11.980\n I was doing algebraic geometry of a sort.\n\n18:11.980 --> 18:15.280\n A little bit different from what my supervisor and people,\n\n18:15.280 --> 18:16.780\n but it was algebraic geometry.\n\n18:16.780 --> 18:17.620\n Yeah.\n\n18:17.620 --> 18:20.260\n And I was interested,\n\n18:20.260 --> 18:24.860\n I got particularly interested in three lecture courses\n\n18:24.860 --> 18:27.020\n that were nothing to do with what I was supposed\n\n18:27.020 --> 18:28.260\n to be doing.\n\n18:28.260 --> 18:30.580\n One was a course by Herman Bondy\n\n18:30.580 --> 18:33.500\n on Einstein's general theory of relativity,\n\n18:33.500 --> 18:34.620\n which was a beautiful course.\n\n18:34.620 --> 18:37.540\n He was an amazing lecturer,\n\n18:37.540 --> 18:40.260\n brought these things alive, absolutely.\n\n18:40.260 --> 18:43.360\n Another was a course on quantum mechanics\n\n18:43.360 --> 18:47.060\n given by a great physicist, Paul Dirac.\n\n18:47.060 --> 18:50.560\n Very beautiful course in a completely different way.\n\n18:50.560 --> 18:52.460\n It was, he was very kind of organized\n\n18:52.460 --> 18:56.380\n and never got excited about anything seemingly.\n\n18:58.540 --> 19:00.640\n But it was extremely well put together.\n\n19:00.640 --> 19:03.340\n And I found that amazing too.\n\n19:03.340 --> 19:04.780\n Third course that was nothing to do\n\n19:04.780 --> 19:06.580\n with what I should be doing was a course\n\n19:06.580 --> 19:08.100\n on mathematical logic.\n\n19:08.960 --> 19:12.860\n I got excited, as I say, my discussions with Ian Percival\n\n19:12.860 --> 19:15.980\n was incompleteness theorem already deeply\n\n19:15.980 --> 19:18.740\n within mathematical logic space.\n\n19:18.740 --> 19:20.200\n Were you introduced to it?\n\n19:20.200 --> 19:23.880\n I was introduced to it in detail by the course, by Steen.\n\n19:25.020 --> 19:27.820\n And he, it was two things he described\n\n19:27.820 --> 19:31.040\n which were very fundamental to my understanding.\n\n19:31.040 --> 19:34.260\n One was Turing machines and the whole idea\n\n19:34.260 --> 19:35.820\n of computability and all that.\n\n19:35.820 --> 19:38.300\n So that was all very much part of the course.\n\n19:38.300 --> 19:41.460\n The other one was the G\u00f6del theorem.\n\n19:41.460 --> 19:43.500\n And it wasn't what I was afraid it was\n\n19:43.500 --> 19:45.180\n to tell you there were things in mathematics\n\n19:45.180 --> 19:46.180\n you couldn't prove.\n\n19:47.060 --> 19:51.340\n It was basically, and he phrased it in a way\n\n19:51.340 --> 19:53.100\n which often people didn't.\n\n19:53.100 --> 19:54.860\n And if you read Douglas Soft status book,\n\n19:54.860 --> 19:56.420\n he doesn't, you see.\n\n19:56.420 --> 19:58.220\n But Steen made it very clear.\n\n19:58.220 --> 20:01.140\n And also in a sort of public lecture\n\n20:01.140 --> 20:02.900\n that he gave to a mathematical,\n\n20:02.900 --> 20:04.340\n I think it may be the Adams Society,\n\n20:04.340 --> 20:07.140\n one of the mathematical undergraduate societies.\n\n20:07.140 --> 20:09.460\n And he made this point again very clearly.\n\n20:09.460 --> 20:11.780\n That if you've got a formal system of proof,\n\n20:11.780 --> 20:15.160\n so suppose what you mean by proof\n\n20:15.160 --> 20:19.140\n is something which you could check with a computer.\n\n20:19.140 --> 20:21.220\n So to say whether you've got it right or not,\n\n20:21.220 --> 20:22.340\n you've got a lot of steps.\n\n20:22.340 --> 20:25.940\n Have you carried this computational procedure?\n\n20:25.940 --> 20:30.520\n Well, following the proof, steps of the proof correctly,\n\n20:30.520 --> 20:35.420\n that can be checked by an algorithm, by a computer.\n\n20:35.420 --> 20:38.780\n So that's the key thing.\n\n20:38.780 --> 20:43.780\n Now what you have to, now you see, is this any good?\n\n20:44.420 --> 20:47.260\n If you've got an algorithmic system,\n\n20:47.260 --> 20:49.940\n which claims to say, yes, this is right,\n\n20:49.940 --> 20:52.620\n this you've proved it correctly, this is true.\n\n20:52.620 --> 20:54.820\n If you've proved it, if you made a mistake,\n\n20:54.820 --> 20:55.980\n it doesn't say it's true or false.\n\n20:55.980 --> 20:57.940\n But if you have, if you've done it right,\n\n20:57.940 --> 21:01.980\n then the conclusion you've come to is correct.\n\n21:01.980 --> 21:03.900\n Now you say, why do you believe it's correct?\n\n21:03.900 --> 21:05.420\n Because you've looked at the rules and you said,\n\n21:05.420 --> 21:06.720\n well, okay, that one's all right.\n\n21:06.720 --> 21:07.560\n Yeah, that one's all right.\n\n21:07.560 --> 21:08.380\n What about that?\n\n21:08.380 --> 21:10.100\n Oh, yeah, I see, I see why it's all right.\n\n21:10.100 --> 21:12.020\n Okay, you go through all the rules.\n\n21:12.020 --> 21:13.840\n You say, yes, following those rules,\n\n21:13.840 --> 21:16.940\n if it says, yes, it's true, it is true.\n\n21:17.860 --> 21:19.940\n So you've got to make sure that these rules\n\n21:19.940 --> 21:21.980\n are ones that you trust.\n\n21:21.980 --> 21:25.020\n If you follow the rules and it says it's a proof,\n\n21:25.020 --> 21:27.060\n is the result actually true?\n\n21:27.060 --> 21:27.900\n Right.\n\n21:27.900 --> 21:29.660\n And that your belief that it's true\n\n21:29.660 --> 21:33.140\n depends upon looking at the rules and understanding them.\n\n21:33.140 --> 21:37.300\n Now, what G\u00f6del shows, that if you have such a system,\n\n21:38.180 --> 21:41.220\n then you can construct a statement of the very kind\n\n21:41.220 --> 21:44.380\n that it's supposed to look at, a mathematical statement,\n\n21:44.380 --> 21:47.660\n and you can see by the way it's constructed\n\n21:47.660 --> 21:51.180\n and what it means that it's true,\n\n21:52.380 --> 21:56.620\n but not provable by the rules that you've been given.\n\n21:56.620 --> 21:59.660\n And it depends on your trust in the rules.\n\n21:59.660 --> 22:02.300\n Do you believe that the rules only give you truths?\n\n22:02.300 --> 22:04.260\n If you believe the rules only give you truths,\n\n22:04.260 --> 22:07.620\n then you believe this other statement is also true.\n\n22:07.620 --> 22:09.900\n I found this absolutely mind blowing.\n\n22:09.900 --> 22:12.660\n When I saw this, it blew my mind.\n\n22:12.660 --> 22:17.060\n I thought, my God, you can see that this statement is true.\n\n22:17.060 --> 22:18.940\n It's as good as any proof,\n\n22:18.940 --> 22:21.860\n because it only depends on your belief\n\n22:21.860 --> 22:25.700\n in the reliability of the proof procedure, that's all it is,\n\n22:25.700 --> 22:29.260\n and understanding that the coding is done correctly.\n\n22:29.260 --> 22:32.900\n And it enables you to transcend that system.\n\n22:33.820 --> 22:36.260\n So whatever system you have,\n\n22:36.260 --> 22:39.020\n as long as you can understand what it's doing\n\n22:39.020 --> 22:41.980\n and why you believe it only gives you truths,\n\n22:41.980 --> 22:43.780\n then you can see beyond that system.\n\n22:44.700 --> 22:46.220\n Now, how do you see beyond it?\n\n22:46.220 --> 22:51.220\n What is it that enables you to transcend that system?\n\n22:51.740 --> 22:53.260\n Well, it's your understanding\n\n22:53.260 --> 22:55.740\n of what the system is actually saying\n\n22:55.740 --> 22:57.620\n and what the statement that you've constructed\n\n22:57.620 --> 22:59.460\n is actually saying.\n\n22:59.460 --> 23:03.140\n So it's this quality of understanding, whatever it is,\n\n23:03.140 --> 23:05.540\n which is not governed by rules.\n\n23:05.540 --> 23:07.420\n It's not a computational procedure.\n\n23:07.420 --> 23:09.660\n So this idea of understanding is not going to be\n\n23:09.660 --> 23:13.420\n within the rules of the, within the formal system.\n\n23:13.420 --> 23:15.940\n Yes, you're only using those rules anyway,\n\n23:15.940 --> 23:18.340\n because you have understood them to be rules\n\n23:18.340 --> 23:20.260\n which only give you truths.\n\n23:20.260 --> 23:22.260\n There'd be no point in it otherwise.\n\n23:22.260 --> 23:24.300\n I mean, people say, well, okay, this is,\n\n23:24.300 --> 23:28.020\n it's one set of rules as good as any other.\n\n23:28.020 --> 23:28.860\n Well, it's not true.\n\n23:28.860 --> 23:31.580\n You see, you have to understand what the rules mean.\n\n23:31.580 --> 23:33.580\n And why does that understanding of the mean\n\n23:33.580 --> 23:36.340\n give you something beyond the rules themselves?\n\n23:36.340 --> 23:37.340\n And that's what it was.\n\n23:37.340 --> 23:38.620\n That's what blew my mind.\n\n23:38.620 --> 23:43.620\n It's somehow understanding why the rules give you truths\n\n23:43.820 --> 23:45.900\n enables you to transcend the rules.\n\n23:45.900 --> 23:48.060\n So that's where, I mean, even at that time,\n\n23:48.060 --> 23:50.900\n that's already where the thought entered your mind\n\n23:50.900 --> 23:55.340\n that the idea of understanding, or we can start calling it\n\n23:55.340 --> 23:57.980\n things like intelligence or even consciousness\n\n23:57.980 --> 23:59.660\n is outside the rules.\n\n23:59.660 --> 24:00.500\n Yes.\n\n24:00.500 --> 24:02.900\n See, I've always concentrated on understanding.\n\n24:02.900 --> 24:05.300\n You know, people say, people come and point out things.\n\n24:05.300 --> 24:07.140\n Well, you know, what about creativity?\n\n24:07.140 --> 24:09.100\n That's something a machine can't do is create.\n\n24:09.100 --> 24:09.940\n Well, I don't know.\n\n24:09.940 --> 24:11.260\n What is creativity?\n\n24:11.260 --> 24:12.100\n And I don't know.\n\n24:12.100 --> 24:13.860\n You know, somebody can put some funny things\n\n24:13.860 --> 24:15.620\n on a piece of paper and say that's creative\n\n24:15.620 --> 24:16.900\n and you could make a machine do that.\n\n24:16.900 --> 24:18.100\n Is it really creative?\n\n24:18.100 --> 24:18.940\n I don't know.\n\n24:18.940 --> 24:20.540\n You see, I worry about that one.\n\n24:20.540 --> 24:22.860\n I sort of agree with it in a sense,\n\n24:22.860 --> 24:25.460\n but it's so hard to do anything with that statement.\n\n24:25.460 --> 24:27.740\n But understanding, yes, you can.\n\n24:27.740 --> 24:32.580\n You can make, go see that understanding, whatever it is,\n\n24:32.580 --> 24:34.300\n and it's very hard to put your finger on it.\n\n24:34.300 --> 24:35.740\n That's absolutely true.\n\n24:35.740 --> 24:39.620\n Can you try to define or maybe dance around\n\n24:39.620 --> 24:41.980\n a definition of understanding?\n\n24:41.980 --> 24:45.980\n To some degree, but I don't, I often wondered about this,\n\n24:45.980 --> 24:48.900\n but there is something there which is very slippery.\n\n24:48.900 --> 24:52.700\n It's something like standing back.\n\n24:52.700 --> 24:54.140\n And it's got to be something, you see,\n\n24:54.140 --> 24:56.940\n it's also got to be something which was of value\n\n24:56.940 --> 24:58.900\n to our remote ancestors.\n\n24:58.900 --> 24:59.740\n Right.\n\n24:59.740 --> 25:01.540\n Because sometimes, there's a cartoon\n\n25:01.540 --> 25:04.940\n which I drew sometimes showing you how all these,\n\n25:04.940 --> 25:07.140\n there's in the foreground, you see this mathematician\n\n25:07.140 --> 25:08.860\n just doing some mathematical theorem.\n\n25:08.860 --> 25:10.500\n There's a little bit of a joke in that theorem,\n\n25:10.500 --> 25:12.300\n but let's not go into that.\n\n25:12.300 --> 25:14.420\n He's trying to prove some theorem.\n\n25:14.420 --> 25:17.820\n And he's about to be eaten by a saber tooth tiger\n\n25:17.820 --> 25:21.260\n who's hiding in the undergrowth, you see.\n\n25:21.260 --> 25:24.340\n And in the distance, you see his cousins\n\n25:24.340 --> 25:29.100\n building, growing crops, building shelters,\n\n25:29.100 --> 25:31.980\n domesticating animals, and in the slight foreground,\n\n25:31.980 --> 25:33.340\n you see they've built a mammoth trap\n\n25:33.340 --> 25:36.660\n and this poor old mammoth is falling into a pit, you see,\n\n25:36.660 --> 25:39.540\n and all these people around them are about to grab him,\n\n25:39.540 --> 25:43.380\n you see, and well, you see, those are the ones who,\n\n25:43.380 --> 25:47.300\n the quality of understanding, which goes with all,\n\n25:47.300 --> 25:50.740\n it's not just the mathematician doing his mathematics,\n\n25:50.740 --> 25:53.660\n this understanding quality is something else,\n\n25:53.660 --> 25:58.100\n which has been a tremendous advantage to us,\n\n25:58.100 --> 25:59.660\n not just to us.\n\n25:59.660 --> 26:03.700\n See, I don't think consciousness is limited to humans.\n\n26:03.700 --> 26:04.900\n Yeah, that's the interesting question,\n\n26:04.900 --> 26:07.380\n at which point, if it is indeed connected\n\n26:07.380 --> 26:09.140\n to the evolutionary process,\n\n26:09.140 --> 26:11.420\n at which point did we pick up this?\n\n26:11.420 --> 26:13.420\n A very hard question.\n\n26:13.420 --> 26:15.860\n It's certainly, I don't think it's primates,\n\n26:15.860 --> 26:20.380\n you know, you see these pictures of African hunting dogs\n\n26:20.380 --> 26:22.780\n and how they can plan amongst themselves\n\n26:22.780 --> 26:24.340\n how to catch the antelopes.\n\n26:25.700 --> 26:27.540\n Some of these David Attenborough films,\n\n26:27.540 --> 26:29.180\n I think this probably was one of them,\n\n26:29.180 --> 26:31.740\n and you could see the hunting dogs,\n\n26:31.740 --> 26:34.300\n and they divide themselves into two groups\n\n26:34.300 --> 26:36.820\n and they go in two routes, two different routes.\n\n26:36.820 --> 26:39.660\n One of them goes and they sort of hide next to the river.\n\n26:40.700 --> 26:42.420\n And the other group goes around\n\n26:42.420 --> 26:46.460\n and they start yelping at these, they don't bark,\n\n26:46.460 --> 26:48.980\n I guess whatever noise hunting dogs do,\n\n26:48.980 --> 26:51.020\n the antelopes, and they sort of round them up\n\n26:51.020 --> 26:54.500\n and they chase them in the direction of the river.\n\n26:54.500 --> 26:56.580\n And there are the other ones just waiting for them,\n\n26:56.580 --> 26:58.900\n just to get, because when they get to the river,\n\n26:58.900 --> 27:00.300\n it slows them down.\n\n27:00.300 --> 27:02.060\n And so they pounce on them.\n\n27:02.060 --> 27:05.460\n So they've obviously planned this all out somehow.\n\n27:05.460 --> 27:06.740\n I have no idea how.\n\n27:07.660 --> 27:11.460\n And there is some element of conscious planning,\n\n27:11.460 --> 27:12.300\n as far as I can see.\n\n27:12.300 --> 27:14.300\n I don't think it's just some kind of,\n\n27:16.140 --> 27:19.580\n so much of AI these days is done on what they call\n\n27:19.580 --> 27:21.060\n bottom up systems, is it?\n\n27:21.060 --> 27:23.660\n Yeah, where you have neural networks\n\n27:23.660 --> 27:27.460\n and you give them a zillion different things to look at\n\n27:27.460 --> 27:32.460\n and then they sort of can choose one thing over another,\n\n27:33.780 --> 27:35.460\n just because it's seen so many examples\n\n27:35.460 --> 27:38.380\n and picks up on little signals,\n\n27:38.380 --> 27:41.540\n which one may not even be conscious of.\n\n27:41.540 --> 27:43.140\n And that doesn't feel like understanding.\n\n27:43.140 --> 27:46.100\n There's no understanding in that whatsoever.\n\n27:46.100 --> 27:49.460\n Well, you're being a little bit human centric, so.\n\n27:49.460 --> 27:52.860\n Well, I'm talking about, I'm not with the dogs, am I?\n\n27:52.860 --> 27:53.700\n No, you're not.\n\n27:53.700 --> 27:56.740\n Sorry, not human centric, but I misspoke.\n\n27:56.740 --> 27:59.340\n Biology centric.\n\n27:59.340 --> 28:00.940\n Is it possible that consciousness\n\n28:00.940 --> 28:03.220\n would just look slightly different?\n\n28:03.220 --> 28:04.700\n Well, I'm not saying it's biological,\n\n28:04.700 --> 28:06.620\n because we don't know.\n\n28:06.620 --> 28:08.500\n I think other examples of elephants\n\n28:08.500 --> 28:10.660\n is a wonderful example, too.\n\n28:10.660 --> 28:13.980\n Where they, this was, I think this was an Attenborough one,\n\n28:13.980 --> 28:17.220\n where the elephants have to go from along,\n\n28:17.220 --> 28:20.100\n the troop of them have to go long distances.\n\n28:20.100 --> 28:21.620\n And the leader of a troop is a female.\n\n28:21.620 --> 28:23.500\n They all are, apparently.\n\n28:23.500 --> 28:26.820\n And this female, she had to go all the way\n\n28:26.820 --> 28:30.100\n from one part of the country to another.\n\n28:30.100 --> 28:32.460\n And at a certain point, she made a detour.\n\n28:32.460 --> 28:35.020\n And they went off in this big detour.\n\n28:35.020 --> 28:37.100\n All the troop came with her.\n\n28:37.100 --> 28:39.580\n And this was where her sister had died.\n\n28:39.580 --> 28:41.540\n And there were her bones lying around.\n\n28:41.540 --> 28:42.820\n And they're going to pick up the bones,\n\n28:42.820 --> 28:45.780\n and they hand it around, and they caress the bones.\n\n28:45.780 --> 28:48.580\n And then they put them back, and they go back again.\n\n28:48.580 --> 28:51.300\n What in the hell are they doing?\n\n28:51.300 --> 28:52.260\n That's so interesting.\n\n28:52.260 --> 28:54.540\n I mean, there's something going on.\n\n28:54.540 --> 28:59.500\n There's no clear connection with natural selection.\n\n28:59.500 --> 29:03.060\n There's just some deep feeling going on there,\n\n29:03.060 --> 29:05.660\n which has to do with their conscious experience.\n\n29:06.980 --> 29:09.940\n And I think it's something that, overall,\n\n29:09.940 --> 29:14.940\n is advantageous, our natural selection,\n\n29:15.020 --> 29:17.380\n but not directly to do with natural selection.\n\n29:18.740 --> 29:19.580\n I like that.\n\n29:19.580 --> 29:22.540\n There's something going on there.\n\n29:22.540 --> 29:24.340\n Like I told you, I'm Russian,\n\n29:24.340 --> 29:28.140\n so I tend to romanticize all things of this nature,\n\n29:28.140 --> 29:33.140\n that it's not merely cold, hard computation.\n\n29:33.300 --> 29:35.660\n Perhaps I could just slightly answer your question.\n\n29:35.660 --> 29:38.620\n You were asking me, what is it?\n\n29:38.620 --> 29:41.820\n There's something about sort of standing back\n\n29:41.820 --> 29:44.820\n and thinking about your own thought processes.\n\n29:44.820 --> 29:47.780\n I mean, there is something like that in the G\u00f6del thing,\n\n29:47.780 --> 29:50.260\n because you're not following the rules.\n\n29:50.260 --> 29:53.500\n You're standing back and thinking about the rules.\n\n29:53.500 --> 29:56.940\n And so there is something that you might say,\n\n29:56.940 --> 29:58.220\n you think about you're doing something,\n\n29:58.220 --> 30:00.140\n and you think, what the hell am I doing?\n\n30:00.140 --> 30:02.140\n And you sort of stand back and think about\n\n30:02.140 --> 30:05.060\n what it is that's making you think in such a way.\n\n30:05.060 --> 30:08.500\n Just take a step back outside the game you've been playing.\n\n30:08.500 --> 30:10.660\n Yeah, you back up and you think about,\n\n30:10.660 --> 30:12.580\n you're just not playing the game anymore.\n\n30:12.580 --> 30:14.660\n You're thinking about what the hell you're doing\n\n30:14.660 --> 30:16.060\n in playing this game.\n\n30:16.060 --> 30:18.260\n And that's somehow,\n\n30:18.260 --> 30:20.540\n it's not a very precise description,\n\n30:20.540 --> 30:22.260\n but somehow it feels very true\n\n30:22.260 --> 30:24.620\n that that's somehow understanding.\n\n30:24.620 --> 30:26.420\n This kind of reflection.\n\n30:26.420 --> 30:27.740\n The reflection, yes.\n\n30:27.740 --> 30:30.580\n Yeah, it's a bit hard to put your finger on,\n\n30:30.580 --> 30:31.580\n but there is something there,\n\n30:31.580 --> 30:34.420\n which I think maybe could be unearthed at some point\n\n30:34.420 --> 30:36.860\n and see this is really what's going on,\n\n30:36.860 --> 30:40.100\n why conscious beings have this advantage,\n\n30:40.100 --> 30:42.740\n what it is that gives them advantage.\n\n30:42.740 --> 30:44.220\n And I think it goes way back.\n\n30:44.220 --> 30:46.780\n I don't think we're talking about the hunting dogs\n\n30:46.780 --> 30:47.700\n and the elephants.\n\n30:48.700 --> 30:51.860\n It's pretty clear that octopuses have\n\n30:51.860 --> 30:53.380\n the same sort of quality,\n\n30:53.380 --> 30:54.460\n and we call it consciousness.\n\n30:54.460 --> 30:55.700\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n30:55.700 --> 30:58.740\n Seen enough examples of the way that they behave\n\n30:58.740 --> 31:02.500\n and the evolution route is completely different.\n\n31:03.620 --> 31:05.900\n Does it go way back to some common ancestor\n\n31:05.900 --> 31:07.580\n or did it come separately?\n\n31:07.580 --> 31:09.380\n My hope is it's something simple,\n\n31:09.380 --> 31:13.460\n but the hard question if there's a hardware prerequisite.\n\n31:13.460 --> 31:17.820\n We have to develop some kind of hardware mechanisms\n\n31:17.820 --> 31:19.180\n in our computers.\n\n31:19.180 --> 31:21.100\n Like basically, as you suggest,\n\n31:21.100 --> 31:22.580\n we'll get to in a second,\n\n31:22.580 --> 31:24.460\n we kind of have to throw away the computer\n\n31:24.460 --> 31:26.100\n as we know it today.\n\n31:26.100 --> 31:26.940\n Yeah.\n\n31:26.940 --> 31:28.340\n The deterministic machines we know today\n\n31:28.340 --> 31:29.740\n to try to create it.\n\n31:29.740 --> 31:33.380\n I mean, my hope, of course, is not, but...\n\n31:35.180 --> 31:37.740\n Well, I should go really back to the story\n\n31:37.740 --> 31:39.820\n which, in a sense, I haven't finished\n\n31:39.820 --> 31:41.780\n because I went to these three courses, you see,\n\n31:41.780 --> 31:43.900\n when I was a graduate student.\n\n31:43.900 --> 31:46.940\n And so I started to think, well, I'm really,\n\n31:46.940 --> 31:49.660\n I'm a pretty, what you might call a materialist\n\n31:49.660 --> 31:53.620\n in the sense of thinking that there's no kind of mystical\n\n31:53.620 --> 31:55.980\n something or other which comes in from who knows where.\n\n31:55.980 --> 31:56.820\n You still that?\n\n31:56.820 --> 31:58.540\n Are you still, throughout your life, been a materialist?\n\n31:58.540 --> 32:00.020\n I don't like the word materialist\n\n32:00.020 --> 32:02.820\n because it suggests we know what material is.\n\n32:02.820 --> 32:06.060\n And that is a bad word because...\n\n32:06.060 --> 32:07.620\n But there's no mystical.\n\n32:07.620 --> 32:09.180\n It's not some mystical something\n\n32:09.180 --> 32:11.740\n which is not treatable by science.\n\n32:11.740 --> 32:12.700\n That's so beautifully put,\n\n32:12.700 --> 32:14.300\n just to pause on that for a second.\n\n32:14.300 --> 32:17.020\n You're a materialist, but you acknowledge\n\n32:17.020 --> 32:19.140\n that we don't really know what the material is.\n\n32:19.140 --> 32:19.980\n That's right.\n\n32:19.980 --> 32:24.300\n I mean, I like to call myself a scientist, I suppose,\n\n32:24.300 --> 32:26.180\n but it means that...\n\n32:27.700 --> 32:30.500\n Yes, well, you see, the question goes on here.\n\n32:30.500 --> 32:33.180\n So I began thinking, okay, if consciousness\n\n32:33.180 --> 32:35.900\n or understanding is something\n\n32:35.900 --> 32:40.020\n which is not a computational process, what can it be?\n\n32:40.020 --> 32:42.300\n And I knew enough from my undergraduate work.\n\n32:42.300 --> 32:44.500\n I knew about Newtonian mechanics,\n\n32:44.500 --> 32:50.140\n and I knew how basically you could put it on a computer.\n\n32:50.140 --> 32:54.180\n There is a fundamental issue, which is it important or not?\n\n32:54.180 --> 32:59.620\n That computation depends upon discrete things.\n\n32:59.620 --> 33:02.300\n So you're using discrete elements,\n\n33:02.300 --> 33:06.260\n whereas the physical laws depend on the continuum.\n\n33:06.260 --> 33:09.660\n Now, is this something to do with it?\n\n33:09.660 --> 33:12.820\n Is it the fact that we use the continuum in our physics?\n\n33:12.820 --> 33:15.260\n And if we model our physical system,\n\n33:15.260 --> 33:17.940\n we use discrete systems like ordinary computers?\n\n33:19.020 --> 33:22.180\n I came to the view that that's probably not it.\n\n33:22.180 --> 33:24.860\n I might have to retract on that someday,\n\n33:24.860 --> 33:28.340\n but the view was no, you can get close enough.\n\n33:28.340 --> 33:30.900\n It's not altogether clear, I have to say,\n\n33:30.900 --> 33:32.980\n but you can get close enough.\n\n33:32.980 --> 33:37.020\n And I went to this course by Bondi on general relativity,\n\n33:37.020 --> 33:39.500\n and I thought, well, you can put that on a computer,\n\n33:39.500 --> 33:42.820\n because that was a long time before people,\n\n33:42.820 --> 33:43.980\n and I've sort of grown up with this,\n\n33:43.980 --> 33:46.220\n how people have done better and better calculations,\n\n33:46.220 --> 33:48.300\n and they could work out about black holes,\n\n33:48.300 --> 33:50.380\n and they can then work out how black holes\n\n33:50.380 --> 33:52.700\n can interact with each other, spiral around,\n\n33:52.700 --> 33:55.020\n and what kind of gravitational waves can out.\n\n33:55.020 --> 33:58.620\n And it's a very impressive piece of computational work,\n\n33:58.620 --> 34:01.900\n how you can actually work out the shapes of those signals.\n\n34:01.900 --> 34:04.020\n And now we have LIGO seeing these signals,\n\n34:04.020 --> 34:07.340\n and they say, yeah, those black holes spiral into each other.\n\n34:07.340 --> 34:11.700\n This is just a vindication of the power of computation\n\n34:11.700 --> 34:16.020\n in describing Einstein's general relativity.\n\n34:16.020 --> 34:18.620\n So in that case, we can get close,\n\n34:18.620 --> 34:22.060\n but with computation, we can get close\n\n34:22.060 --> 34:23.340\n to our understanding of the physics.\n\n34:23.340 --> 34:24.620\n You can get very, very close.\n\n34:24.620 --> 34:26.900\n Now, is that close enough, you see?\n\n34:26.900 --> 34:29.620\n And then I went to this course by Dirac.\n\n34:29.620 --> 34:32.500\n Now, you see, I think it was the very first lecture\n\n34:32.500 --> 34:35.420\n that he gave, and he was talking about\n\n34:35.420 --> 34:37.500\n a superposition principle.\n\n34:37.500 --> 34:39.900\n And he said, if you have a particle,\n\n34:39.900 --> 34:41.860\n you usually think of particle can be over here\n\n34:41.860 --> 34:44.100\n or over there, but in quantum mechanics,\n\n34:44.100 --> 34:48.060\n it can be over here and over there at the same time.\n\n34:48.060 --> 34:50.500\n And you have these states which involve\n\n34:50.500 --> 34:52.740\n a superposition in some sense\n\n34:52.740 --> 34:56.660\n of different locations for that particle.\n\n34:56.660 --> 34:58.540\n And then he got out his piece of chalk.\n\n34:58.540 --> 35:00.020\n Some people say he broke it in two\n\n35:00.020 --> 35:03.020\n as a kind of illustration of how the piece of chalk\n\n35:03.020 --> 35:05.820\n might be over here and over there at the same time.\n\n35:06.700 --> 35:10.900\n And he was talking about this, and my mind wandered.\n\n35:10.900 --> 35:13.340\n I don't remember what he said.\n\n35:13.340 --> 35:16.460\n All I can remember, he's just moved on to the next topic,\n\n35:16.460 --> 35:18.580\n and something about energy he'd mentioned,\n\n35:18.580 --> 35:21.020\n which I had no idea what it had to do with anything.\n\n35:21.020 --> 35:22.900\n And so I'd been struck with this\n\n35:22.900 --> 35:25.260\n and worried about it ever since.\n\n35:25.260 --> 35:27.780\n It's probably just as well I didn't hear his explanation\n\n35:27.780 --> 35:29.340\n because it was probably one of these things\n\n35:29.340 --> 35:32.100\n to calm me down and not worry about it anymore.\n\n35:32.100 --> 35:35.900\n Whereas in my case, I've worried about it ever since.\n\n35:35.900 --> 35:38.420\n So I thought maybe that's the catch.\n\n35:38.420 --> 35:41.220\n There is something in quantum mechanics\n\n35:41.220 --> 35:45.060\n where the superpositions become one or the other,\n\n35:45.060 --> 35:47.820\n and that's not part of quantum mechanics.\n\n35:47.820 --> 35:50.020\n There's something missing in the theory.\n\n35:50.020 --> 35:51.620\n The theory is incomplete.\n\n35:51.620 --> 35:52.580\n It's not just incomplete.\n\n35:52.580 --> 35:54.900\n It's in a certain sense not quite right\n\n35:54.900 --> 35:57.500\n because if you follow the equation,\n\n35:57.500 --> 35:59.340\n the basic equation of quantum mechanics,\n\n35:59.340 --> 36:01.220\n that's the Schrodinger equation,\n\n36:01.220 --> 36:02.660\n you could put that on a computer too.\n\n36:02.660 --> 36:03.780\n There are lots of difficulties\n\n36:03.780 --> 36:06.180\n about how many parameters you have to put in and so on.\n\n36:06.180 --> 36:07.500\n That can be very tricky,\n\n36:07.500 --> 36:10.860\n but nevertheless, it is a computational process.\n\n36:10.860 --> 36:14.940\n Modulo this question about the continuum as before,\n\n36:14.940 --> 36:16.900\n but it's not clear that makes any difference.\n\n36:16.900 --> 36:18.940\n So our theories of quantum mechanics\n\n36:18.940 --> 36:20.980\n may be missing the same element\n\n36:20.980 --> 36:23.740\n that the universal Turing machine\n\n36:23.740 --> 36:25.500\n is missing about consciousness.\n\n36:25.500 --> 36:26.420\n Yes, yes.\n\n36:26.420 --> 36:29.700\n Yeah, this is the view I held is that you need a theory\n\n36:29.700 --> 36:33.580\n and that what people call the reduction of the state\n\n36:33.580 --> 36:35.780\n or the collapse of the wave function,\n\n36:35.780 --> 36:36.780\n which you have to have,\n\n36:36.780 --> 36:38.500\n otherwise quantum mechanics doesn't relate\n\n36:38.500 --> 36:39.900\n to the world we see.\n\n36:39.900 --> 36:41.420\n To make it relate to the world we see,\n\n36:41.420 --> 36:45.140\n you've got to break the Schrodinger equation.\n\n36:45.140 --> 36:49.220\n Schrodinger himself was absolutely appalled by this idea,\n\n36:49.220 --> 36:50.900\n his own equation.\n\n36:50.900 --> 36:52.620\n I mean, that's why he introduced\n\n36:52.620 --> 36:56.340\n this famous Schrodinger's cat as a thought experiment.\n\n36:56.340 --> 36:57.180\n He's really saying, look,\n\n36:57.180 --> 36:59.580\n this is where my equation leads you into it.\n\n36:59.580 --> 37:01.340\n There's something wrong,\n\n37:01.340 --> 37:02.620\n something we haven't understood,\n\n37:02.620 --> 37:05.260\n which is basically fundamental.\n\n37:05.260 --> 37:07.860\n And so I was trying to put all these things together\n\n37:07.860 --> 37:09.100\n and said, well, it's got to be\n\n37:09.100 --> 37:11.860\n the noncomputability comes in there.\n\n37:11.860 --> 37:14.780\n And I also can't quite remember when I thought this,\n\n37:14.780 --> 37:18.100\n but it's when gravity is involved in quantum mechanics.\n\n37:18.100 --> 37:19.820\n It's the combination of those two.\n\n37:19.820 --> 37:20.980\n And that's that point\n\n37:22.260 --> 37:25.980\n when you have good reasons to believe,\n\n37:25.980 --> 37:27.580\n this came much later,\n\n37:27.580 --> 37:29.860\n that I have good reason to believe\n\n37:29.860 --> 37:32.860\n that the principles of general relativity\n\n37:32.860 --> 37:34.180\n and those of quantum mechanics,\n\n37:34.180 --> 37:35.980\n most particularly,\n\n37:35.980 --> 37:39.260\n it's the basic principle of equivalence,\n\n37:39.260 --> 37:41.340\n which goes back to Galileo.\n\n37:41.340 --> 37:43.580\n If you fall freely,\n\n37:43.580 --> 37:46.420\n you eliminate the gravitational field.\n\n37:46.420 --> 37:48.140\n So you imagine Galileo\n\n37:49.660 --> 37:51.460\n dropping his big rock and his little rock\n\n37:51.460 --> 37:52.580\n from the leaning tower,\n\n37:52.580 --> 37:54.300\n whether he actually ever did that or not,\n\n37:54.300 --> 37:55.580\n pretty irrelevant.\n\n37:55.580 --> 37:57.780\n And as the rocks fall to the ground,\n\n37:57.780 --> 37:59.820\n you have a little insect sitting on one of them,\n\n37:59.820 --> 38:01.380\n looking at the other one.\n\n38:01.380 --> 38:04.220\n And it seems to think, oh, there's no gravity here.\n\n38:04.220 --> 38:05.340\n Of course, it hits the ground\n\n38:05.340 --> 38:07.900\n and then you realize something's difference going on.\n\n38:07.900 --> 38:10.140\n But when it's in free fall,\n\n38:10.140 --> 38:11.980\n the gravity has been eliminated.\n\n38:11.980 --> 38:15.420\n Galileo understood that very beautifully.\n\n38:15.420 --> 38:18.540\n He gives these wonderful examples of fireworks.\n\n38:18.540 --> 38:20.380\n And you see the fireworks and explode,\n\n38:20.380 --> 38:23.500\n and you see this fear of sparkling fireworks.\n\n38:23.500 --> 38:26.860\n It remains as fear as it falls down,\n\n38:26.860 --> 38:29.260\n as though there were no gravity.\n\n38:29.260 --> 38:31.300\n So he understood that principle,\n\n38:31.300 --> 38:33.580\n but he couldn't make a theory out of it.\n\n38:33.580 --> 38:34.620\n Einstein came along,\n\n38:34.620 --> 38:36.780\n used exactly the same principle.\n\n38:36.780 --> 38:38.060\n And that's the basis\n\n38:38.060 --> 38:40.420\n of Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\n38:41.420 --> 38:43.580\n Now, there is a conflict.\n\n38:43.580 --> 38:45.260\n This is something I did much, much later.\n\n38:45.260 --> 38:47.540\n So this wasn't at those days,\n\n38:47.540 --> 38:48.940\n much, much later.\n\n38:48.940 --> 38:51.460\n You can see there is a basic conflict\n\n38:51.460 --> 38:54.580\n between the principle of superposition,\n\n38:54.580 --> 38:56.380\n the thing that Dirac was talking about,\n\n38:56.380 --> 38:58.740\n and the principle of general covariance.\n\n38:58.740 --> 39:01.060\n Well, principle of equivalence.\n\n39:01.060 --> 39:03.740\n Gravitational field's equivalent to an acceleration.\n\n39:03.740 --> 39:04.780\n Can you pause for a second?\n\n39:04.780 --> 39:06.900\n What is the principle of equivalence?\n\n39:06.900 --> 39:08.300\n It's this Galileo principle\n\n39:08.300 --> 39:11.580\n that we can eliminate, at least locally.\n\n39:11.580 --> 39:13.580\n You have to be in a small neighborhood\n\n39:13.580 --> 39:16.460\n because if you have people dropping rocks\n\n39:16.460 --> 39:18.100\n all around the world somewhere,\n\n39:18.100 --> 39:19.940\n you can't get rid of it all at once.\n\n39:19.940 --> 39:22.100\n But in the local neighborhood,\n\n39:22.100 --> 39:24.300\n you can eliminate the gravitational field\n\n39:24.300 --> 39:26.820\n by falling freely with it.\n\n39:26.820 --> 39:28.540\n And we now see this with astronauts,\n\n39:28.540 --> 39:30.700\n and they don't, you know, the Earth is right there.\n\n39:30.700 --> 39:32.580\n You can see the great globe of the Earth\n\n39:32.580 --> 39:33.980\n right beneath them.\n\n39:33.980 --> 39:35.460\n But they don't care about it.\n\n39:35.460 --> 39:37.860\n As far as they're concerned, there's no gravity.\n\n39:39.140 --> 39:42.140\n They fall freely within the gravitational field,\n\n39:42.140 --> 39:45.140\n and that gets rid of the gravitational field.\n\n39:45.140 --> 39:46.740\n And that's the principle of equivalence.\n\n39:46.740 --> 39:48.980\n So what's the contradiction?\n\n39:48.980 --> 39:50.460\n What's the tension with superposition\n\n39:50.460 --> 39:51.300\n and equivalence?\n\n39:51.300 --> 39:52.780\n Oh, well, that's technical.\n\n39:52.780 --> 39:55.100\n So just to backtrack for a second\n\n39:55.100 --> 39:57.980\n just to see if we can weave a thread through it all.\n\n39:57.980 --> 40:02.340\n So we started to think about consciousness\n\n40:02.340 --> 40:06.740\n as potentially needing some of the same,\n\n40:06.740 --> 40:08.780\n not mystical, but some of the same magic.\n\n40:08.780 --> 40:10.580\n You see, it is a complicated story.\n\n40:10.580 --> 40:11.820\n So, you know, people think,\n\n40:11.820 --> 40:14.180\n oh, I'm drifting away from the point or something.\n\n40:14.180 --> 40:16.700\n But I think it is a complicated story.\n\n40:16.700 --> 40:17.780\n So what I'm trying to say,\n\n40:17.780 --> 40:19.380\n I mean, I try to put it in a nutshell,\n\n40:19.380 --> 40:20.700\n but it's not so easy.\n\n40:20.700 --> 40:24.900\n I'm trying to say that whatever consciousness is,\n\n40:24.900 --> 40:27.220\n it's not a computation.\n\n40:27.220 --> 40:29.260\n Or it's not a physical process\n\n40:29.260 --> 40:33.340\n which can be described by computation.\n\n40:33.340 --> 40:34.860\n But it nevertheless could be,\n\n40:34.860 --> 40:37.940\n so one of the interesting models\n\n40:37.940 --> 40:39.860\n that you've proposed\n\n40:39.860 --> 40:41.980\n is the orchestrated objective reduction.\n\n40:41.980 --> 40:44.660\n Yes, well, you see, that's going from there, you see.\n\n40:44.660 --> 40:46.740\n So I say I have no idea.\n\n40:46.740 --> 40:50.340\n So I wrote this book through my scientific career.\n\n40:50.340 --> 40:52.660\n I thought, you know, when I'm retired,\n\n40:52.660 --> 40:55.700\n I'll have enough time to write a sort of a popularish book\n\n40:56.860 --> 41:01.180\n which I will explain my ideas and puzzles,\n\n41:01.180 --> 41:04.140\n what I like, beautiful things about physics and mathematics,\n\n41:04.140 --> 41:07.460\n and this puzzle about computability\n\n41:07.460 --> 41:09.540\n and consciousness and so on.\n\n41:09.540 --> 41:13.100\n And in the process of writing this book,\n\n41:13.100 --> 41:14.460\n well, I thought I'd do it when I was retired.\n\n41:14.460 --> 41:16.260\n I didn't actually, I didn't wait that long\n\n41:16.260 --> 41:19.380\n because there was a radio discussion\n\n41:19.380 --> 41:24.140\n between Edward Fredkin and Marvin Minsky.\n\n41:24.140 --> 41:28.180\n And they were talking about what computers could do.\n\n41:28.180 --> 41:30.540\n And they were entering a big room.\n\n41:30.540 --> 41:32.020\n They imagined entering this big room\n\n41:32.020 --> 41:33.780\n where at the other end of the room,\n\n41:33.780 --> 41:36.900\n two computers were talking to each other.\n\n41:36.900 --> 41:39.220\n And as you walk up to the computers,\n\n41:39.220 --> 41:41.700\n they will have communicated to each other\n\n41:41.700 --> 41:46.620\n more ideas, concepts, things than the entire human race\n\n41:46.620 --> 41:47.540\n had ever done.\n\n41:49.100 --> 41:51.620\n So I thought, well, I know where you're coming from,\n\n41:51.620 --> 41:53.620\n but I just don't believe you.\n\n41:53.620 --> 41:54.860\n There's something missing.\n\n41:57.020 --> 41:59.180\n So I thought, well, I should write my book.\n\n42:00.380 --> 42:01.620\n And so I did.\n\n42:01.620 --> 42:04.060\n It was roughly the same time Stephen Hawking\n\n42:04.060 --> 42:07.620\n was writing his brief history of time.\n\n42:07.620 --> 42:11.220\n In the 80s at some point.\n\n42:11.220 --> 42:12.860\n The book you're talking about is The Emperor's New Mind.\n\n42:12.860 --> 42:13.980\n The Emperor's New Mind, that's right.\n\n42:13.980 --> 42:16.140\n And both are incredible books,\n\n42:16.140 --> 42:18.500\n The Brief History of Time and The Emperor's New Mind.\n\n42:18.500 --> 42:19.900\n Yes, it was quite interesting\n\n42:19.900 --> 42:23.460\n because he told me he'd got Carl Sagan, I think,\n\n42:23.460 --> 42:26.580\n to write a foreword for the book, you see.\n\n42:26.580 --> 42:28.220\n So I thought, gosh, what am I gonna do?\n\n42:28.220 --> 42:31.060\n I'm not gonna get anywhere unless I get somebody.\n\n42:31.060 --> 42:32.700\n So I said, oh, I know Martin Gardner,\n\n42:32.700 --> 42:34.380\n so I wonder if he'd do it.\n\n42:34.380 --> 42:36.660\n So he did, and he did a very nice foreword.\n\n42:36.660 --> 42:38.260\n So that's an incredible book,\n\n42:38.260 --> 42:40.420\n and some of the same people you mentioned,\n\n42:40.420 --> 42:44.620\n Ed Franken, which I guess of expert systems fame,\n\n42:44.620 --> 42:46.980\n and Minsky, of course, people know in the AI world,\n\n42:46.980 --> 42:49.820\n but they represent the artificial intelligence world\n\n42:49.820 --> 42:53.740\n that do hope and dream that AI's intelligence is.\n\n42:53.740 --> 42:54.860\n Well, you see, it was my thinking,\n\n42:54.860 --> 42:57.420\n well, you know, I see where they're coming from.\n\n42:57.420 --> 42:59.940\n From that perspective, yeah, you're right.\n\n42:59.940 --> 43:01.620\n But that's not my perspective.\n\n43:01.620 --> 43:03.460\n So I thought I had to say it.\n\n43:03.460 --> 43:05.060\n And as I was writing my book, you see,\n\n43:05.060 --> 43:06.740\n I thought, well, I don't really know anything\n\n43:06.740 --> 43:07.780\n about neurophysiology.\n\n43:07.780 --> 43:09.220\n What am I doing writing this book?\n\n43:09.220 --> 43:12.140\n So I started reading up about neurophysiology,\n\n43:12.140 --> 43:13.100\n and I read up, and I think,\n\n43:13.100 --> 43:14.580\n now, I'm trying to find out how it is\n\n43:14.580 --> 43:16.460\n that nerve signals could possibly\n\n43:16.460 --> 43:18.340\n preserve quantum coherence.\n\n43:18.340 --> 43:20.900\n And all I read is that the electrical signals\n\n43:20.900 --> 43:25.540\n which go along the nerves create effects through the brain.\n\n43:25.540 --> 43:28.260\n There's no chance you can isolate it.\n\n43:28.260 --> 43:29.860\n So I thought, this is hopeless.\n\n43:29.860 --> 43:31.660\n So I come to the end of the book,\n\n43:31.660 --> 43:33.580\n and I more or less give up.\n\n43:33.580 --> 43:36.380\n I just think of something which I didn't believe in.\n\n43:36.380 --> 43:38.420\n Maybe this is a way around it, but no.\n\n43:39.460 --> 43:40.540\n And then, you see, I thought, well,\n\n43:40.540 --> 43:43.380\n maybe this book will at least stimulate young people\n\n43:43.380 --> 43:45.140\n to do science or something.\n\n43:45.140 --> 43:48.420\n And I got all these letters from old, retired people instead.\n\n43:48.420 --> 43:51.180\n These are the only people who had time to read my book.\n\n43:52.260 --> 43:53.100\n So, I mean, but.\n\n43:53.100 --> 43:54.900\n Except for Stuart Hameroff.\n\n43:54.900 --> 43:56.420\n Except for Stuart Hameroff.\n\n43:56.420 --> 43:58.460\n Stuart Hameroff wrote to me, and he said,\n\n43:58.460 --> 44:00.060\n I think you're missing something.\n\n44:01.060 --> 44:03.420\n You don't know about microtubules, do you?\n\n44:03.420 --> 44:04.820\n He didn't put it quite like that.\n\n44:04.820 --> 44:05.940\n But that was more or less it.\n\n44:05.940 --> 44:08.860\n And he said, this is what you really need to consider.\n\n44:08.860 --> 44:10.620\n So I thought, my God, yes.\n\n44:10.620 --> 44:12.980\n That's a much more promising structure.\n\n44:12.980 --> 44:16.340\n So, I mean, fundamentally, you were searching\n\n44:16.340 --> 44:21.340\n for the source of, noncomputable source of consciousness\n\n44:22.100 --> 44:25.060\n within the human brain, in the biology.\n\n44:25.060 --> 44:30.060\n And so, what are, if I may ask, what are microtubules?\n\n44:30.060 --> 44:33.860\n Well, you see, I was ignorant in what I'd read.\n\n44:33.860 --> 44:37.700\n I never came across them in the books I looked at.\n\n44:37.700 --> 44:40.860\n Perhaps I only read rather superficially, which is true.\n\n44:40.860 --> 44:43.100\n But I didn't know about microtubules.\n\n44:43.100 --> 44:45.300\n Stuart, I think one of the things\n\n44:45.300 --> 44:47.060\n that impressed him about them was,\n\n44:47.060 --> 44:51.380\n when you see pictures of mitosis, that's a cell dividing,\n\n44:51.380 --> 44:53.300\n and you see all the chromosomes.\n\n44:53.300 --> 44:55.700\n And the chromosomes, they all get lined up,\n\n44:55.700 --> 44:57.980\n and then they get pulled apart.\n\n44:57.980 --> 45:02.100\n And so, as the cell divides, half the chromosomes go,\n\n45:02.100 --> 45:04.940\n they divide into the two parts,\n\n45:04.940 --> 45:07.460\n and they go two different ways.\n\n45:07.460 --> 45:09.860\n And what is it that's pulling them apart?\n\n45:09.860 --> 45:12.900\n Well, those are these little things called microtubules.\n\n45:12.900 --> 45:15.580\n And so, he started to get interested in them.\n\n45:15.580 --> 45:18.900\n And he formed the view, well, he was,\n\n45:18.900 --> 45:21.100\n his day job or night job or whatever you call it,\n\n45:21.100 --> 45:23.060\n is to put people to sleep,\n\n45:23.060 --> 45:24.700\n except he doesn't like calling it sleep\n\n45:24.700 --> 45:25.820\n because it's different.\n\n45:25.820 --> 45:29.340\n General anesthetics in a reversible way.\n\n45:29.340 --> 45:32.500\n So, you want to make sure that they don't experience\n\n45:32.500 --> 45:36.780\n the pain that would otherwise be something that they feel.\n\n45:36.780 --> 45:40.380\n And consciousness is turned off for a while,\n\n45:40.380 --> 45:41.940\n and it can be turned back on again.\n\n45:41.940 --> 45:44.980\n So, it's crucial that you can turn it off and turn it on.\n\n45:44.980 --> 45:47.460\n And what do you do when you're doing that?\n\n45:47.460 --> 45:49.700\n What do general anesthetic gases do?\n\n45:50.580 --> 45:54.980\n And see, he formed the view that it's the microtubules\n\n45:54.980 --> 45:56.860\n that they affect.\n\n45:56.860 --> 46:01.020\n And the details of why he formed that view is not,\n\n46:01.020 --> 46:02.300\n well, they're clear to me,\n\n46:02.300 --> 46:05.660\n but there's an interesting story he keeps talking about.\n\n46:05.660 --> 46:08.500\n But I found this very exciting\n\n46:08.500 --> 46:11.500\n because I thought these structures,\n\n46:11.500 --> 46:15.420\n these little tubes which inhabit pretty well all cells,\n\n46:15.420 --> 46:16.780\n it's not just neurons,\n\n46:17.980 --> 46:20.580\n apart from red blood cells,\n\n46:20.580 --> 46:23.940\n they inhabit pretty well all the other cells in the body.\n\n46:23.940 --> 46:25.380\n But they're not all the same kind.\n\n46:25.380 --> 46:28.020\n You get different kinds of microtubules.\n\n46:28.020 --> 46:31.780\n And the ones that excited me the most,\n\n46:31.780 --> 46:34.500\n this may still not be totally clear,\n\n46:34.500 --> 46:36.180\n but the ones that excited me most\n\n46:36.180 --> 46:39.300\n were the only ones that I knew about at the time\n\n46:39.300 --> 46:43.260\n because they're very, very symmetrical structures.\n\n46:44.180 --> 46:45.620\n And I had reason to believe\n\n46:45.620 --> 46:48.100\n that these very symmetrical structures\n\n46:48.100 --> 46:52.140\n would be much better at preserving a quantum state,\n\n46:52.140 --> 46:54.700\n quantum coherence, preserving the thing without,\n\n46:55.700 --> 46:58.780\n you just need to preserve certain degrees of freedom\n\n46:58.780 --> 47:01.060\n without them leaking into the environment.\n\n47:01.060 --> 47:03.420\n Once they leak into the environment, you're lost.\n\n47:03.420 --> 47:08.140\n So you've got to preserve these quantum states at a level\n\n47:08.140 --> 47:12.420\n which the state reduction process comes in\n\n47:12.420 --> 47:16.140\n and that's where I think the noncomputability comes in\n\n47:17.380 --> 47:19.700\n and it's the measurement process in quantum mechanics,\n\n47:19.700 --> 47:20.820\n what's going on.\n\n47:20.820 --> 47:23.580\n So something about the measurement process\n\n47:23.580 --> 47:24.420\n and what's going on,\n\n47:24.420 --> 47:27.140\n something about the structure of the microtubules,\n\n47:27.140 --> 47:29.540\n your intuition says maybe there's something here,\n\n47:29.540 --> 47:32.500\n maybe this kind of structure allows\n\n47:32.500 --> 47:35.500\n for the mystery of the quantum mechanics.\n\n47:35.500 --> 47:37.260\n There was a much better chance, yes.\n\n47:37.260 --> 47:40.780\n It just struck me that partly it was the symmetry\n\n47:40.780 --> 47:43.180\n because there is a feature of symmetry\n\n47:43.180 --> 47:46.300\n you can preserve quantum coherence\n\n47:46.300 --> 47:48.140\n much better with symmetrical structures.\n\n47:48.140 --> 47:50.340\n There's a good reason for that.\n\n47:50.340 --> 47:52.540\n And that impressed me a lot.\n\n47:52.540 --> 47:54.700\n I didn't know the difference between the A lattice\n\n47:54.700 --> 47:57.940\n and B lattice at that time, which could be important.\n\n47:57.940 --> 48:00.860\n Now that could even, see, which isn't talked about much.\n\n48:00.860 --> 48:02.620\n But that's some, in some sense, details.\n\n48:02.620 --> 48:04.380\n We've got to take a step back just to say\n\n48:04.380 --> 48:06.140\n in case people are not familiar.\n\n48:06.140 --> 48:11.140\n So this was called the orchestrated objective reduction\n\n48:13.220 --> 48:18.220\n idea or ORCOR, which is a biological philosophy of mind\n\n48:18.220 --> 48:20.740\n that postulates that consciousness originates\n\n48:20.740 --> 48:22.340\n at the quantum level inside neurons.\n\n48:22.340 --> 48:25.340\n So that has to do with your search for where,\n\n48:25.340 --> 48:26.700\n where is it coming from?\n\n48:26.700 --> 48:29.580\n So that's counter to the notion that consciousness\n\n48:29.580 --> 48:33.220\n may arise from the computation performed by the synapses.\n\n48:33.220 --> 48:35.620\n Yes, I think the key point.\n\n48:35.620 --> 48:40.620\n Sometimes people say it's because it's quantum mechanical.\n\n48:40.820 --> 48:42.660\n It's not just that.\n\n48:42.660 --> 48:45.060\n See, it's more outrageous than that.\n\n48:45.060 --> 48:46.300\n You see, this is one reason I think\n\n48:46.300 --> 48:48.340\n we're so far off from it,\n\n48:48.340 --> 48:51.060\n because we don't even know the physics right.\n\n48:51.060 --> 48:53.860\n You see, it's not just quantum mechanics.\n\n48:53.860 --> 48:55.900\n People say, oh, you know, quantum systems\n\n48:55.900 --> 48:57.340\n and biological structures.\n\n48:57.340 --> 49:00.340\n No, will you starting to see that\n\n49:00.340 --> 49:04.700\n some basic biological systems does depend on quantum.\n\n49:05.900 --> 49:07.620\n I mean, look, in the first place,\n\n49:07.620 --> 49:09.860\n all of chemistry is quantum mechanics.\n\n49:09.860 --> 49:13.140\n People got used to that, so they don't count that.\n\n49:13.140 --> 49:16.660\n So he said, let's not count quantum chemistry.\n\n49:16.660 --> 49:19.100\n We sort of got the hang of that, I think.\n\n49:19.100 --> 49:21.340\n But you have quantum effects,\n\n49:21.340 --> 49:25.460\n which are not just chemical, in photosynthesis.\n\n49:25.460 --> 49:27.220\n And this is one of the striking things\n\n49:27.220 --> 49:29.300\n in the last several years,\n\n49:29.300 --> 49:34.220\n that photosynthesis seems to be a basically quantum process,\n\n49:34.220 --> 49:36.860\n which is not simply chemical.\n\n49:36.860 --> 49:41.460\n It's using quantum mechanics in a very basic way.\n\n49:41.460 --> 49:43.100\n So you could start saying, oh, well,\n\n49:43.100 --> 49:45.580\n if photosynthesis is based on quantum mechanics,\n\n49:45.580 --> 49:50.260\n why not behavior of neurons and things like that?\n\n49:50.260 --> 49:52.140\n Maybe there's something\n\n49:52.140 --> 49:55.060\n which is a bit like photosynthesis in that respect.\n\n49:55.060 --> 49:58.140\n But what I'm saying is even more outrageous than that,\n\n49:58.140 --> 50:00.780\n because those things are talking\n\n50:00.780 --> 50:03.700\n about conventional quantum mechanics.\n\n50:03.700 --> 50:07.540\n Now, my argument says that conventional quantum mechanics,\n\n50:07.540 --> 50:09.420\n if you're just following the Schrodinger equation,\n\n50:09.420 --> 50:11.700\n that's still computable.\n\n50:11.700 --> 50:13.900\n So you've got to go beyond that.\n\n50:13.900 --> 50:15.860\n So you've got to go to where\n\n50:17.420 --> 50:21.060\n quantum mechanics goes wrong in a certain sense.\n\n50:21.940 --> 50:23.820\n You have to be a little bit careful about that,\n\n50:23.820 --> 50:26.060\n because the way people do quantum mechanics\n\n50:26.060 --> 50:31.060\n is a sort of mixture of two different processes.\n\n50:32.820 --> 50:35.460\n One of them is the Schrodinger equation,\n\n50:35.460 --> 50:38.820\n which is an equation Schrodinger wrote down,\n\n50:38.820 --> 50:42.580\n and it tells you how the state of a system evolves.\n\n50:42.580 --> 50:44.740\n And it evolves according to this equation,\n\n50:44.740 --> 50:47.300\n completely deterministic,\n\n50:47.300 --> 50:50.300\n but it evolves into ridiculous situations.\n\n50:50.300 --> 50:51.540\n And this was what Schrodinger\n\n50:51.540 --> 50:54.260\n was very much pointing out with his cat.\n\n50:54.260 --> 50:55.820\n He said, you follow my equation,\n\n50:55.820 --> 50:57.380\n that's Schrodinger's equation,\n\n50:57.380 --> 51:01.300\n and you could say that you have to get a cat,\n\n51:01.300 --> 51:04.260\n a cat which is dead and alive at the same time.\n\n51:04.260 --> 51:07.140\n That would be the evolution of the Schrodinger equation,\n\n51:07.140 --> 51:10.380\n would lead to a state, which is the cat being dead\n\n51:10.380 --> 51:12.700\n and alive at the same time.\n\n51:12.700 --> 51:15.700\n And he's more or less saying, this is an absurdity.\n\n51:16.620 --> 51:18.380\n People nowadays say, oh, well, Schrodinger said\n\n51:18.380 --> 51:20.140\n you can have a cat which is dead, that's not that.\n\n51:20.140 --> 51:23.380\n You see, he was saying, this is an absurdity.\n\n51:23.380 --> 51:24.740\n There's something missing.\n\n51:25.620 --> 51:28.620\n And that the reduction of the state\n\n51:28.620 --> 51:31.940\n or the collapse of the wave function or whatever it is,\n\n51:31.940 --> 51:34.700\n is something which has to be understood.\n\n51:34.700 --> 51:37.780\n It's not following the Schrodinger equation.\n\n51:37.780 --> 51:41.940\n It's not the way we conventionally do quantum mechanics.\n\n51:41.940 --> 51:43.580\n There's something more than that.\n\n51:44.700 --> 51:48.220\n And it's easy to quote authority here because Einstein,\n\n51:49.820 --> 51:52.540\n at least three of the greatest physicists\n\n51:52.540 --> 51:57.180\n of 20th century who were very fundamental\n\n51:57.180 --> 51:58.780\n in developing quantum mechanics,\n\n51:58.780 --> 52:01.820\n Einstein, one of them, Schrodinger, another,\n\n52:01.820 --> 52:03.580\n Dirac, another.\n\n52:03.580 --> 52:05.500\n You have to look carefully at Dirac's writing\n\n52:05.500 --> 52:09.180\n because he didn't tend to say this out loud too much\n\n52:09.180 --> 52:11.300\n because he was very cautious about what he said.\n\n52:11.300 --> 52:14.220\n You find the right place and you see he says\n\n52:14.220 --> 52:16.620\n quantum mechanics is a provisional theory.\n\n52:18.060 --> 52:21.660\n We need something which explains\n\n52:21.660 --> 52:23.500\n the collapse of the wave function.\n\n52:23.500 --> 52:26.220\n We need to go beyond the theory we have now.\n\n52:27.900 --> 52:29.900\n I happen to be one of the kinds of people,\n\n52:29.900 --> 52:31.860\n there are many, there is a whole group of people,\n\n52:31.860 --> 52:35.580\n they're all considered to be a bit mavericks,\n\n52:35.580 --> 52:38.900\n who believe that quantum mechanics needs to be modified.\n\n52:38.900 --> 52:41.180\n There's a small minority of those people,\n\n52:41.180 --> 52:42.740\n which are already a minority,\n\n52:42.740 --> 52:46.220\n who think that the way in which it's modified\n\n52:46.220 --> 52:47.500\n has to be with gravity.\n\n52:48.700 --> 52:51.420\n And there is an even smaller minority of those people\n\n52:51.420 --> 52:53.580\n who think it's the particular way that I think it is.\n\n52:53.580 --> 52:55.180\n You see.\n\n52:55.180 --> 52:56.860\n So those are the quantum gravity folks.\n\n52:56.860 --> 52:57.700\n But what's...\n\n52:57.700 --> 53:00.740\n You see, quantum gravity is already not this.\n\n53:00.740 --> 53:02.660\n Because when you say quantum gravity,\n\n53:02.660 --> 53:05.460\n what you really mean is quantum mechanics\n\n53:05.460 --> 53:08.020\n applied to gravitational theory.\n\n53:08.020 --> 53:10.660\n So you say, let's take this wonderful formalism\n\n53:10.660 --> 53:15.220\n of quantum mechanics and make gravity fit into it.\n\n53:15.220 --> 53:18.060\n So that is what quantum gravity is meant to be.\n\n53:18.060 --> 53:21.500\n Now I'm saying you've got to be more even handed\n\n53:21.500 --> 53:24.460\n that gravity affects the structure of quantum mechanics too.\n\n53:24.460 --> 53:26.860\n It's not just you quantize gravity,\n\n53:26.860 --> 53:29.460\n you've got to gravitate quantum mechanics.\n\n53:29.460 --> 53:31.140\n And it's a two way thing.\n\n53:31.140 --> 53:32.980\n But then when do you even get started?\n\n53:32.980 --> 53:35.260\n So that you're saying that we have to figure out\n\n53:35.260 --> 53:36.860\n a totally new ideas in there.\n\n53:36.860 --> 53:37.940\n Exactly.\n\n53:37.940 --> 53:39.980\n No, you're stuck.\n\n53:39.980 --> 53:41.260\n You don't have a theory.\n\n53:41.260 --> 53:42.780\n That's the trouble.\n\n53:42.780 --> 53:44.540\n So this is a big problem.\n\n53:44.540 --> 53:46.020\n If you say, okay, well, what's the theory?\n\n53:46.020 --> 53:47.300\n I don't know.\n\n53:47.300 --> 53:49.420\n So maybe in the very early days, sort of...\n\n53:49.420 --> 53:51.020\n It is in the very early days.\n\n53:51.020 --> 53:52.620\n But just making this point.\n\n53:52.620 --> 53:53.780\n Yes.\n\n53:53.780 --> 53:55.780\n You see, Stuart Hammeroff tends to be,\n\n53:55.780 --> 53:58.700\n oh, Penrose says that it's got to be a reduction\n\n53:58.700 --> 54:00.620\n of the state and so on, so let's use it.\n\n54:00.620 --> 54:02.140\n The trouble is Penrose doesn't say that.\n\n54:02.140 --> 54:06.940\n Penrose says, well, I think that we have no experiments\n\n54:06.940 --> 54:10.100\n as yet, which shows that.\n\n54:10.100 --> 54:12.580\n There are experiments which are being thought through\n\n54:12.580 --> 54:15.740\n and which I'm hoping will be performed.\n\n54:15.740 --> 54:18.340\n There is an experiment which is being developed\n\n54:18.340 --> 54:22.060\n by Dirk Baumeister, who I've known for a long time,\n\n54:22.060 --> 54:25.340\n who shares his time between Leiden in the Netherlands\n\n54:25.340 --> 54:27.900\n and Santa Barbara in the US.\n\n54:27.900 --> 54:29.700\n And he's been working on an experiment\n\n54:29.700 --> 54:34.700\n which could perhaps demonstrate that quantum mechanics,\n\n54:35.180 --> 54:37.420\n as we now understand it, if you don't bring in\n\n54:37.420 --> 54:41.720\n the gravitational effects, it has to be modified.\n\n54:42.580 --> 54:45.980\n And then there's also experiments that are underway\n\n54:45.980 --> 54:50.620\n that kind of look at the microtubule side of things\n\n54:50.620 --> 54:52.580\n to see if there's, in the biology,\n\n54:52.580 --> 54:53.820\n you could see something like that.\n\n54:53.820 --> 54:55.060\n Could you briefly mention it?\n\n54:55.060 --> 54:58.140\n Because that's really sort of one of the only\n\n54:58.140 --> 55:00.860\n experimental attempts in the very early days\n\n55:00.860 --> 55:02.740\n of even thinking about consciousness.\n\n55:02.740 --> 55:05.420\n I think there's a very serious area here,\n\n55:05.420 --> 55:07.300\n which is what Stuart Hammeroff is doing,\n\n55:07.300 --> 55:09.020\n and I think it's very important.\n\n55:09.020 --> 55:11.740\n One of the few places that you can really get\n\n55:11.740 --> 55:14.780\n a bit of a handle on what consciousness is\n\n55:14.780 --> 55:17.040\n is what turns it off.\n\n55:17.040 --> 55:20.020\n And when you're thinking about general anesthetics,\n\n55:20.020 --> 55:21.660\n it's very specific.\n\n55:21.660 --> 55:24.220\n These things turn consciousness off.\n\n55:24.220 --> 55:26.300\n What the hell do they do?\n\n55:26.300 --> 55:29.900\n Well, Stuart and a number of people who work with him\n\n55:29.900 --> 55:34.420\n and others happen to believe that the general anesthetics\n\n55:34.420 --> 55:36.720\n directly affect microtubules.\n\n55:36.720 --> 55:38.660\n And there is some evidence for this.\n\n55:38.660 --> 55:40.180\n I don't know how strong it is\n\n55:40.180 --> 55:43.800\n and how watertight the case is,\n\n55:43.800 --> 55:46.740\n but I think there is some evidence pointing\n\n55:46.740 --> 55:49.140\n in that kind of direction.\n\n55:49.140 --> 55:51.180\n It's not just an ordinary chemical process.\n\n55:51.180 --> 55:53.500\n There's something quite different about it.\n\n55:53.500 --> 55:56.900\n And one of the main candidates\n\n55:56.900 --> 55:59.260\n is that these anesthetic gases\n\n55:59.260 --> 56:01.660\n do affect directly microtubules.\n\n56:02.620 --> 56:04.460\n And how strong that evidence is,\n\n56:04.460 --> 56:07.100\n I wouldn't be in a position to say,\n\n56:07.100 --> 56:10.060\n but I think there is fairly impressive evidence.\n\n56:10.060 --> 56:12.700\n And the point is the experiments are being undertaken,\n\n56:12.700 --> 56:13.540\n which is. Yeah.\n\n56:13.540 --> 56:14.660\n I mean, that is experimental.\n\n56:14.660 --> 56:17.260\n You see, so it's a very clear direction\n\n56:17.260 --> 56:18.720\n where you can think of experiments\n\n56:18.720 --> 56:21.800\n which could indicate whether or not\n\n56:21.800 --> 56:24.980\n it's really microtubules which the anesthetic gases\n\n56:24.980 --> 56:26.100\n directly affect.\n\n56:26.100 --> 56:27.300\n That's really exciting.\n\n56:27.300 --> 56:30.380\n One of the sad things is as far as I'm,\n\n56:30.380 --> 56:31.820\n from my outside perspective,\n\n56:31.820 --> 56:34.420\n is not many people are working on this.\n\n56:34.420 --> 56:37.220\n So there's a very, like with Stuart,\n\n56:37.220 --> 56:38.940\n it feels like there's very few people\n\n56:38.940 --> 56:41.280\n are carrying the flag forward on this.\n\n56:41.280 --> 56:44.860\n I think it's not many in the sense it's a minority,\n\n56:44.860 --> 56:46.420\n but it's not zero anymore.\n\n56:46.420 --> 56:49.840\n You see, when Stuart and I were originally taught by us,\n\n56:49.840 --> 56:52.860\n we were just us and a few of our friends,\n\n56:52.860 --> 56:54.220\n there weren't many people taking it,\n\n56:54.220 --> 56:59.220\n but it's grown into one of the main viewpoints.\n\n56:59.500 --> 57:02.540\n There might be about four or five or six different\n\n57:03.540 --> 57:06.260\n views which people hold,\n\n57:06.260 --> 57:07.660\n and it's one of them.\n\n57:07.660 --> 57:11.100\n So it's considered as one of the possible\n\n57:12.060 --> 57:13.340\n lines of thinking, yes.\n\n57:13.340 --> 57:15.100\n You describe physics theories\n\n57:15.100 --> 57:16.940\n as falling into one of three categories,\n\n57:16.940 --> 57:19.860\n the superb, the useful, or the tentative.\n\n57:19.860 --> 57:21.700\n I like those words.\n\n57:21.700 --> 57:23.580\n It's a beautiful categorization.\n\n57:23.580 --> 57:26.980\n Do you think we'll ever have a superb theory\n\n57:26.980 --> 57:29.800\n of intelligence and of consciousness?\n\n57:29.800 --> 57:30.640\n We might.\n\n57:31.700 --> 57:33.740\n We're a long way from it.\n\n57:33.740 --> 57:35.020\n I don't think we're even,\n\n57:35.020 --> 57:36.940\n whether we're in the tentative scale.\n\n57:36.940 --> 57:37.980\n I mean, it's...\n\n57:40.020 --> 57:42.420\n You don't think we've even entered the realm of tentative?\n\n57:42.420 --> 57:43.260\n Probably not.\n\n57:43.260 --> 57:44.580\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n57:44.580 --> 57:47.140\n Now, when you see this, it's so controversial.\n\n57:47.140 --> 57:49.180\n We don't have a clear view\n\n57:49.180 --> 57:53.100\n which is accepted by a majority.\n\n57:53.100 --> 57:54.340\n I mean, you see, yeah, people,\n\n57:54.340 --> 57:57.300\n most views are computational in one form or another.\n\n57:57.300 --> 57:59.260\n They think it's some, but it's not very clear,\n\n57:59.260 --> 58:03.460\n because even the IIT people who\n\n58:04.700 --> 58:06.540\n think of them as computational,\n\n58:06.540 --> 58:08.020\n but I've heard them say,\n\n58:08.020 --> 58:09.980\n no, consciousness is supposed to be not computational.\n\n58:09.980 --> 58:10.980\n I say, well, if it's not computational,\n\n58:10.980 --> 58:12.140\n what in the hell is it?\n\n58:12.140 --> 58:14.100\n What's going on?\n\n58:14.100 --> 58:17.120\n What physical processes are going on which are that?\n\n58:18.900 --> 58:21.700\n What does it mean for something to be computational then?\n\n58:21.700 --> 58:23.900\n So, is...\n\n58:25.100 --> 58:27.740\n Well, there has to be a process which is...\n\n58:29.380 --> 58:30.500\n You see, it's very curious\n\n58:30.500 --> 58:34.140\n the way the history has developed in quantum mechanics,\n\n58:34.140 --> 58:35.460\n because very early on,\n\n58:35.460 --> 58:37.780\n people thought there was something to do with consciousness,\n\n58:37.780 --> 58:39.980\n but it was almost the other way around.\n\n58:39.980 --> 58:42.980\n You see, you have to say the Schrodinger equation\n\n58:42.980 --> 58:46.020\n says all these different alternatives happen all at once,\n\n58:46.020 --> 58:48.540\n and then when is it that only one of them happens?\n\n58:48.540 --> 58:50.820\n Well, one of the views, which was quite commonly held\n\n58:50.820 --> 58:53.460\n by a few distinguished quantum physicists,\n\n58:53.460 --> 58:56.620\n that's when a conscious being looks at the system\n\n58:56.620 --> 58:57.940\n or becomes aware of it,\n\n58:57.940 --> 59:00.700\n and at that point, it becomes one or the other.\n\n59:01.740 --> 59:03.700\n That's a role where consciousness\n\n59:03.700 --> 59:07.020\n is somehow actively reducing the state.\n\n59:07.020 --> 59:10.140\n My view is almost the exact opposite of that.\n\n59:10.140 --> 59:14.180\n It's the state reduces itself in some way which...\n\n59:14.180 --> 59:17.100\n Some noncomputational way which we don't understand,\n\n59:17.100 --> 59:19.180\n we don't have a proper theory of,\n\n59:19.180 --> 59:24.180\n and that is the building block of what consciousness is.\n\n59:24.420 --> 59:26.220\n So consciousness is the other way around.\n\n59:26.220 --> 59:31.220\n It depends on that choice which nature makes all the time\n\n59:31.220 --> 59:33.100\n when the state becomes one or the other\n\n59:33.100 --> 59:36.020\n rather than the superposition of one and the other,\n\n59:36.020 --> 59:39.540\n and when that happens, there is what we're saying now,\n\n59:39.540 --> 59:43.100\n an element of proto consciousness takes place.\n\n59:43.100 --> 59:45.620\n Proto consciousness is, roughly speaking,\n\n59:45.620 --> 59:47.380\n the building block out of which\n\n59:47.380 --> 59:50.060\n actual consciousness is constructed.\n\n59:50.060 --> 59:53.180\n So you have these proto conscious elements,\n\n59:53.180 --> 59:55.020\n which are when the state decides\n\n59:55.020 --> 59:57.540\n to do one thing or the other,\n\n59:57.540 --> 1:00:01.540\n and that's the thing which when organized together,\n\n1:00:01.540 --> 1:00:05.420\n that's the OR part in ORCOR, but the ORC part,\n\n1:00:05.420 --> 1:00:08.580\n that's the OR part at least one can see\n\n1:00:08.580 --> 1:00:10.260\n where we're driving at a theory.\n\n1:00:10.260 --> 1:00:13.140\n You can say it's the quantum choice\n\n1:00:13.140 --> 1:00:14.700\n of going this way or that way,\n\n1:00:14.700 --> 1:00:17.700\n but the ORC part, which is the orchestration of this,\n\n1:00:17.700 --> 1:00:19.580\n is much more mysterious,\n\n1:00:19.580 --> 1:00:23.260\n and how does the brain somehow orchestrate\n\n1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:26.580\n all these individual OR processes\n\n1:00:26.580 --> 1:00:31.580\n into a genuine, genuine conscious experience?\n\n1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:35.100\n And it might be something that's beautifully simple,\n\n1:00:35.100 --> 1:00:37.780\n but we're completely in the dark about.\n\n1:00:37.780 --> 1:00:40.220\n Yeah, I think at the moment, that's the thing,\n\n1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.940\n you know, we happily put the word ORC down there\n\n1:00:42.940 --> 1:00:47.500\n to say orchestrated, but that's even more unclear\n\n1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:49.020\n what that really means.\n\n1:00:49.020 --> 1:00:54.020\n Just like the word material, orchestrated, who knows?\n\n1:00:54.700 --> 1:00:56.220\n And we've been dancing a little bit\n\n1:00:56.220 --> 1:00:58.780\n between the word intelligence\n\n1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:00.980\n or understanding and consciousness.\n\n1:01:00.980 --> 1:01:03.060\n Do you kind of see those as sitting\n\n1:01:03.060 --> 1:01:05.820\n in the same space of mystery as we discussed?\n\n1:01:05.820 --> 1:01:07.820\n Yes, well, you see, I tend to say\n\n1:01:07.820 --> 1:01:12.820\n you have understanding and intelligence and awareness,\n\n1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:19.100\n and somehow understanding is in the middle of it, you see.\n\n1:01:21.220 --> 1:01:25.660\n I like to say, could you say of an entity\n\n1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:27.860\n that is actually intelligent\n\n1:01:27.860 --> 1:01:30.380\n if it doesn't have the quality of understanding?\n\n1:01:30.380 --> 1:01:33.740\n Now, you see, I'm using terms I don't even know how to define,\n\n1:01:33.740 --> 1:01:34.580\n but who cares?\n\n1:01:34.580 --> 1:01:35.420\n I'm just relating them.\n\n1:01:35.420 --> 1:01:38.500\n They're somewhat poetic, so if I somehow understand them.\n\n1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:40.900\n Yes, that's right, we don't, exactly.\n\n1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:42.300\n But they're not mathematical in nature.\n\n1:01:42.300 --> 1:01:44.100\n Yes, you see, as a mathematician,\n\n1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:45.420\n I don't know how to define any of them,\n\n1:01:45.420 --> 1:01:47.460\n but at least I can point to the connections.\n\n1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:50.260\n So the idea is intelligence is something\n\n1:01:50.260 --> 1:01:53.980\n which I believe needs understanding,\n\n1:01:53.980 --> 1:01:56.420\n otherwise you wouldn't say it's really intelligence.\n\n1:01:56.420 --> 1:01:59.460\n And understanding needs awareness,\n\n1:01:59.460 --> 1:02:02.020\n otherwise you wouldn't really say it's understanding.\n\n1:02:02.020 --> 1:02:04.420\n Do you say of an entity that understands something,\n\n1:02:04.420 --> 1:02:08.420\n unless it's really aware of it, you know, normal usage.\n\n1:02:08.420 --> 1:02:10.940\n So there's a three sort of awareness,\n\n1:02:10.940 --> 1:02:13.780\n understanding, and intelligence.\n\n1:02:13.780 --> 1:02:17.500\n And I just tend to concentrate on understanding\n\n1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:19.220\n because that's where I can say something.\n\n1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:20.060\n Okay.\n\n1:02:20.060 --> 1:02:21.940\n And that's the G\u00f6del theorem, things like that.\n\n1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:24.900\n But what does it mean to be,\n\n1:02:24.900 --> 1:02:26.900\n perceive the color blue or something?\n\n1:02:26.900 --> 1:02:28.460\n I mean, I'm foggiest.\n\n1:02:28.460 --> 1:02:31.020\n It's a much more difficult question.\n\n1:02:31.020 --> 1:02:34.020\n I mean, is it the same if I see a color blue and you see it?\n\n1:02:34.020 --> 1:02:36.540\n If you're somebody with this condition,\n\n1:02:36.540 --> 1:02:38.260\n what's it called then?\n\n1:02:38.260 --> 1:02:41.500\n Or where you assign a sound to a color.\n\n1:02:41.500 --> 1:02:42.340\n Yeah, yeah, that's right.\n\n1:02:42.340 --> 1:02:44.700\n You get colors and sounds mixed up.\n\n1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:45.820\n And that sort of thing.\n\n1:02:45.820 --> 1:02:47.740\n I mean, an interesting subject.\n\n1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:50.820\n But from the physics perspective,\n\n1:02:50.820 --> 1:02:53.180\n from the fundamentals perspective, we don't.\n\n1:02:53.180 --> 1:02:56.260\n I think we're way off having much understanding\n\n1:02:56.260 --> 1:02:57.860\n what's going on there.\n\n1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:01.300\n In your 2010 book, Cycles of Time,\n\n1:03:01.300 --> 1:03:04.300\n you suggest that another universe may have existed\n\n1:03:04.300 --> 1:03:06.220\n before the Big Bang.\n\n1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:08.740\n Can you describe this idea?\n\n1:03:08.740 --> 1:03:10.900\n First of all, what is the Big Bang?\n\n1:03:10.900 --> 1:03:13.020\n Sounds like a funny word.\n\n1:03:13.020 --> 1:03:17.060\n And what may have been there before it?\n\n1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:17.900\n Yes.\n\n1:03:17.900 --> 1:03:19.300\n Just as a matter of terminology,\n\n1:03:19.300 --> 1:03:21.740\n I don't like to call it another universe.\n\n1:03:21.740 --> 1:03:23.020\n Because when you have another universe,\n\n1:03:23.020 --> 1:03:25.500\n you think of it kind of quite separate from us.\n\n1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:28.660\n But these things, they're not separate.\n\n1:03:28.660 --> 1:03:31.820\n Now the Big Bang, conventional theory.\n\n1:03:31.820 --> 1:03:34.180\n You see, I was actually brought up\n\n1:03:34.180 --> 1:03:35.900\n in the sense of when I started getting\n\n1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:36.860\n interested in cosmology,\n\n1:03:36.860 --> 1:03:39.220\n there was a thing called the Steady State Model,\n\n1:03:39.220 --> 1:03:41.340\n which was sort of philosophically very interesting.\n\n1:03:41.340 --> 1:03:43.020\n And there wasn't a Big Bang in that theory.\n\n1:03:43.020 --> 1:03:46.980\n But somehow, new material was created all the time\n\n1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:48.060\n in the form of hydrogen,\n\n1:03:48.060 --> 1:03:50.500\n and the universe kept on expanding, expanding, expanding,\n\n1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:52.540\n and there was room for more hydrogen.\n\n1:03:52.540 --> 1:03:54.940\n It was a rather philosophically nice picture.\n\n1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:59.940\n It was disproved when the Big Bang,\n\n1:03:59.940 --> 1:04:01.820\n well, when I say the Big Bang,\n\n1:04:01.820 --> 1:04:04.900\n this was theoretically discovered\n\n1:04:04.900 --> 1:04:07.860\n by people trying to solve Einstein's equations\n\n1:04:07.860 --> 1:04:09.340\n and apply it to cosmology.\n\n1:04:09.340 --> 1:04:10.700\n Einstein didn't like the idea.\n\n1:04:10.700 --> 1:04:14.340\n He liked a universe which was there all the time.\n\n1:04:14.340 --> 1:04:16.740\n And he had a model which was there all the time.\n\n1:04:16.740 --> 1:04:19.540\n But then there was this discovery,\n\n1:04:19.540 --> 1:04:22.340\n accidental discovery, very important discovery,\n\n1:04:22.340 --> 1:04:25.140\n of this microwave background.\n\n1:04:25.140 --> 1:04:28.460\n And if you, there's the crackle on your television screen\n\n1:04:28.460 --> 1:04:32.740\n which is already sensing this microwave background,\n\n1:04:32.740 --> 1:04:35.140\n which is coming at us from all directions.\n\n1:04:35.140 --> 1:04:37.740\n And you can trace it back and back and back and back.\n\n1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:40.820\n And it came from a very early stage of the universe.\n\n1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:43.700\n Well, it's part of the Big Bang theory.\n\n1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:45.660\n The Big Bang theory was when people tried\n\n1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:47.660\n to solve Einstein's equations.\n\n1:04:47.660 --> 1:04:50.780\n They really found you had to have this initial state\n\n1:04:50.780 --> 1:04:52.420\n where the universe, it used to be called\n\n1:04:52.420 --> 1:04:55.340\n the primordial atom and things like this.\n\n1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:57.860\n There's Friedman and Lemaitre.\n\n1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:01.420\n Friedman was a Russian, Lemaitre was a Belgian.\n\n1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:04.780\n And they independently, well, basically Friedman first.\n\n1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:08.860\n And Lemaitre talked about the initial state,\n\n1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:11.420\n which is a very, very concentrated initial state\n\n1:05:11.420 --> 1:05:13.500\n which seemed to be the origin of the universe.\n\n1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:14.820\n Primordial atom.\n\n1:05:14.820 --> 1:05:17.620\n Primordial atom is what he called it, yes.\n\n1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:20.220\n And then it became, well, Fred Hoyle used the term\n\n1:05:20.220 --> 1:05:22.540\n Big Bang in a kind of derogatory sense.\n\n1:05:22.540 --> 1:05:25.140\n Just like with the Schrodinger and the cats, right?\n\n1:05:25.140 --> 1:05:28.340\n Yes, it's like sort of got picked up on\n\n1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:30.780\n whereas it wasn't his intention originally.\n\n1:05:30.780 --> 1:05:33.620\n But then the evidence piled up and piled up.\n\n1:05:33.620 --> 1:05:36.460\n And one of my friends and I learned a lot from him\n\n1:05:36.460 --> 1:05:38.060\n when I was in Cambridge was Dennis Sharma.\n\n1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:40.580\n He was a great proponent of steady state.\n\n1:05:40.580 --> 1:05:41.980\n And then he got converted.\n\n1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:43.420\n He said, no, I'm sorry.\n\n1:05:43.420 --> 1:05:44.500\n I had a great respect for him.\n\n1:05:44.500 --> 1:05:46.780\n He went around lecturing and said, I was wrong.\n\n1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:48.900\n The steady state model doesn't work.\n\n1:05:48.900 --> 1:05:50.900\n There was this Big Bang.\n\n1:05:50.900 --> 1:05:53.620\n And this microwave background that you see,\n\n1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:55.380\n okay, it's not actually quite the Big Bang.\n\n1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:58.660\n When I say not quite, it's about 380,000 years\n\n1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:01.460\n after the Big Bang, but that's what you see.\n\n1:06:01.460 --> 1:06:03.780\n But then you have to have had this Big Bang before it\n\n1:06:03.780 --> 1:06:05.740\n in order to make the equations work.\n\n1:06:05.740 --> 1:06:09.660\n And it works beautifully except for one little thing,\n\n1:06:09.660 --> 1:06:11.060\n which is this thing called inflation,\n\n1:06:11.060 --> 1:06:14.060\n which people had to put into it to make it work.\n\n1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:16.860\n When I first heard of it, I didn't like it at all.\n\n1:06:16.860 --> 1:06:17.940\n What's inflation?\n\n1:06:17.940 --> 1:06:20.380\n Inflation is that in the first,\n\n1:06:20.380 --> 1:06:22.740\n I'm gonna give you a very tiny number.\n\n1:06:22.740 --> 1:06:23.940\n Think of a second.\n\n1:06:23.940 --> 1:06:25.180\n That's not very long.\n\n1:06:25.180 --> 1:06:26.980\n Now I'm gonna give you a fraction of a second,\n\n1:06:26.980 --> 1:06:29.460\n one over a number.\n\n1:06:29.460 --> 1:06:34.340\n This number has 32 digits between,\n\n1:06:34.340 --> 1:06:37.740\n well, let's say between 36 and 32 digits.\n\n1:06:37.740 --> 1:06:41.260\n Tiny, tiny time between those two tiny,\n\n1:06:41.260 --> 1:06:44.500\n ridiculous seconds, fraction of a second,\n\n1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:46.580\n the universe was supposed to have expanded\n\n1:06:46.580 --> 1:06:49.700\n in this exponential way, an enormous way.\n\n1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:52.060\n For no apparent reason, you had to invent\n\n1:06:52.060 --> 1:06:54.700\n a particular thing called the inflaton field\n\n1:06:54.700 --> 1:06:56.060\n to make it do it.\n\n1:06:56.060 --> 1:06:58.180\n And I thought this is completely crazy.\n\n1:06:58.180 --> 1:07:01.980\n There are reasons why people stuck with this idea.\n\n1:07:01.980 --> 1:07:04.180\n You see, the thing is that I formed my model\n\n1:07:04.180 --> 1:07:07.700\n for reasons which are very fundamental, if you like.\n\n1:07:07.700 --> 1:07:10.420\n It has to do with this very fundamental principle,\n\n1:07:10.420 --> 1:07:13.780\n which is known as the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n1:07:13.780 --> 1:07:16.100\n The second law of thermodynamics says more or less,\n\n1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:18.700\n things get more and more random as time goes on.\n\n1:07:20.020 --> 1:07:22.100\n Now, another way of saying exactly the same thing\n\n1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:24.340\n is things get less and less random.\n\n1:07:24.340 --> 1:07:26.380\n As things go back, as you go back in time,\n\n1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:28.060\n they get less and less random.\n\n1:07:28.060 --> 1:07:30.100\n They go back and back and back and back.\n\n1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:32.020\n And the earliest thing you can directly see\n\n1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:33.540\n is this microwave background.\n\n1:07:34.580 --> 1:07:37.540\n What's one of the most striking features of it\n\n1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:39.220\n is that it's random.\n\n1:07:39.220 --> 1:07:42.500\n It has this, what you call this spectrum of,\n\n1:07:43.700 --> 1:07:46.060\n which is what's called the Planck spectrum,\n\n1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:48.740\n of frequencies, different intensities\n\n1:07:48.740 --> 1:07:49.660\n for different frequencies.\n\n1:07:49.660 --> 1:07:53.340\n And it's this wonderful curve due to Max Planck.\n\n1:07:53.340 --> 1:07:54.700\n And what's it telling you?\n\n1:07:54.700 --> 1:07:58.020\n It's telling you that the entropy is at a maximum.\n\n1:07:58.020 --> 1:08:02.140\n Started off at a maximum and it's going up ever since.\n\n1:08:02.140 --> 1:08:03.900\n I call that the mammoth in the room.\n\n1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:05.580\n I mean, it's a paradox.\n\n1:08:05.580 --> 1:08:07.220\n A mammoth, yeah, it is.\n\n1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:10.500\n And so people, why don't cosmologists worry about this?\n\n1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:11.940\n So I worried about it.\n\n1:08:11.940 --> 1:08:14.940\n And then I thought, well, it's not really a paradox\n\n1:08:14.940 --> 1:08:19.060\n because you're looking at matter and radiation\n\n1:08:19.060 --> 1:08:20.700\n at a maximum entropy state.\n\n1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:25.420\n What you're not seeing directly in that is the gravitation.\n\n1:08:25.420 --> 1:08:28.460\n It's gravitation, which is not thermalized.\n\n1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:32.020\n The gravitation was very, very low entropy.\n\n1:08:32.020 --> 1:08:34.500\n And it's low entropy by the uniformity.\n\n1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:35.980\n And you see that in the microwave too.\n\n1:08:35.980 --> 1:08:38.260\n It's very uniform over the whole sky.\n\n1:08:38.260 --> 1:08:39.500\n I'm compressing a long story\n\n1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:40.820\n into a very short few sentences.\n\n1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:42.060\n And doing a great job, yeah.\n\n1:08:42.060 --> 1:08:45.780\n So what I'm saying is that there's a huge puzzle.\n\n1:08:45.780 --> 1:08:50.700\n Why was gravity in this very low entropy state,\n\n1:08:50.700 --> 1:08:55.260\n very highly organized state, everything else was all random?\n\n1:08:55.260 --> 1:08:59.060\n And that to me was the biggest problem in cosmology.\n\n1:08:59.060 --> 1:09:02.860\n The biggest problem, nobody seems to even worry about it.\n\n1:09:02.860 --> 1:09:04.540\n People say they solved all the problems\n\n1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:05.620\n and they don't even worry about it.\n\n1:09:05.620 --> 1:09:07.420\n They think inflation solves it.\n\n1:09:07.420 --> 1:09:08.860\n It doesn't, it can't.\n\n1:09:08.860 --> 1:09:12.260\n Because it's just that...\n\n1:09:12.260 --> 1:09:14.660\n Just to clarify, that was your problem\n\n1:09:14.660 --> 1:09:18.140\n with the inflation describing some aspect\n\n1:09:18.140 --> 1:09:20.540\n of the moments right after the Big Bang?\n\n1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:22.220\n Inflation is supposed to stretch it out\n\n1:09:22.220 --> 1:09:23.940\n and make it all uniform, you see.\n\n1:09:23.940 --> 1:09:25.420\n It doesn't do it because it can only do it\n\n1:09:25.420 --> 1:09:27.180\n if it's uniform already at the beginning.\n\n1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:28.540\n It's, you just have to look at,\n\n1:09:28.540 --> 1:09:31.700\n I can't go into the details, but it doesn't solve it.\n\n1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:33.820\n And it was completely clear to me it doesn't solve it.\n\n1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:36.340\n But where does the conformal cyclic cosmology\n\n1:09:36.340 --> 1:09:40.260\n of starting to talk about something before\n\n1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:41.820\n that singular and the Big Bang?\n\n1:09:41.820 --> 1:09:44.220\n I was just thinking to myself,\n\n1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:47.660\n how boring this universe is going to be.\n\n1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:49.500\n You've got this exponential expansion.\n\n1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:51.460\n This was discovered early in the,\n\n1:09:51.460 --> 1:09:56.460\n in this century, 21st century.\n\n1:09:56.740 --> 1:10:01.060\n People discovered that these supernova exploding stars\n\n1:10:01.060 --> 1:10:04.580\n showed that the universe is actually undergoing\n\n1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:06.580\n this exponential expansion.\n\n1:10:07.460 --> 1:10:09.540\n So it's a self similar expansion.\n\n1:10:10.580 --> 1:10:14.260\n And it seems to be a feature of this term\n\n1:10:14.260 --> 1:10:17.140\n that Einstein introduced into his cosmology\n\n1:10:17.140 --> 1:10:18.540\n for the wrong reason.\n\n1:10:18.540 --> 1:10:20.580\n He wanted a universe that was static.\n\n1:10:20.580 --> 1:10:23.500\n He put this new term into his cosmology.\n\n1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:24.420\n To make it make sense,\n\n1:10:24.420 --> 1:10:26.460\n it's called the cosmological constant.\n\n1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:28.260\n And then when he got convinced\n\n1:10:28.260 --> 1:10:29.540\n that the universe had a Big Bang,\n\n1:10:29.540 --> 1:10:33.300\n he retracted it complaining this was his greatest blunder.\n\n1:10:33.300 --> 1:10:34.660\n The trouble is it wasn't a blunder.\n\n1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:37.900\n It was actually right, very ironic.\n\n1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:40.260\n And so the universe seems to be behaving\n\n1:10:40.260 --> 1:10:41.980\n with this cosmological constant.\n\n1:10:41.980 --> 1:10:45.100\n Okay, so this universe is expanding and expanding.\n\n1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:46.340\n What's going to happen in the future?\n\n1:10:46.340 --> 1:10:48.860\n Well, it gets more and more boring for a while.\n\n1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:50.580\n What's the most interesting thing in the universe?\n\n1:10:50.580 --> 1:10:51.860\n Well, there's black holes.\n\n1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:53.660\n The black holes more or less gulp down\n\n1:10:53.660 --> 1:10:56.660\n entire clusters of galaxies.\n\n1:10:56.660 --> 1:10:59.100\n The cluster, it'll swallow up most of our galaxy.\n\n1:10:59.100 --> 1:11:01.460\n We will run into our Andromeda galaxy's black hole.\n\n1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:03.660\n That black hole will swallow our one.\n\n1:11:03.660 --> 1:11:04.700\n They'll get bigger and bigger\n\n1:11:04.700 --> 1:11:07.100\n and they'll basically swallow up\n\n1:11:07.100 --> 1:11:10.060\n the whole cluster of galaxies, gulp it all down.\n\n1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:13.780\n Pretty well all, most of it, maybe not all, most of it.\n\n1:11:13.780 --> 1:11:15.300\n Okay, then that'll happen to,\n\n1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:16.820\n there'll be just these black holes around.\n\n1:11:16.820 --> 1:11:19.620\n Pretty boring, but still not as boring as it's gonna get.\n\n1:11:19.620 --> 1:11:21.660\n It's gonna get more boring because these black holes,\n\n1:11:21.660 --> 1:11:24.060\n you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait\n\n1:11:24.060 --> 1:11:26.140\n an unbelievable length of time\n\n1:11:26.140 --> 1:11:30.300\n and Hawking's black hole evaporation starts to come in.\n\n1:11:30.300 --> 1:11:34.340\n And the black holes, you just, it's incredibly tedious.\n\n1:11:34.340 --> 1:11:36.340\n Finally evaporate away.\n\n1:11:36.340 --> 1:11:39.700\n Each one goes away, disappears with a pop at the end.\n\n1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:40.940\n What could be more boring?\n\n1:11:40.940 --> 1:11:43.820\n It was boring then, now this is really boring.\n\n1:11:43.820 --> 1:11:46.620\n There's nothing, not even black holes.\n\n1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:48.940\n Universe gets colder and colder and colder and colder.\n\n1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:52.460\n And I thought, this is very, very boring.\n\n1:11:52.460 --> 1:11:54.540\n Now that's not science, is it?\n\n1:11:54.540 --> 1:11:56.420\n But it's emotional.\n\n1:11:56.420 --> 1:11:59.620\n So I thought, who's gonna be bored by this universe?\n\n1:11:59.620 --> 1:12:01.540\n Not us, we won't be around.\n\n1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:04.100\n It'll be mostly photons running around.\n\n1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:06.180\n And what the photons do, they don't get bored\n\n1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:08.780\n because it's part of relativity, you see.\n\n1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:10.900\n It's not really that they don't experience anything.\n\n1:12:10.900 --> 1:12:12.420\n That's not the point.\n\n1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:15.820\n Photons get right out to infinity\n\n1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:18.580\n without experience any time.\n\n1:12:18.580 --> 1:12:21.020\n It's the way relativity works.\n\n1:12:21.020 --> 1:12:23.500\n And this was part of what I used to do in my old days\n\n1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:25.260\n when I was looking at gravitational radiation\n\n1:12:25.260 --> 1:12:27.500\n and how things behaved to infinity.\n\n1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:30.060\n Infinity is just like another place.\n\n1:12:30.060 --> 1:12:31.900\n You can squash it down.\n\n1:12:31.900 --> 1:12:34.460\n As long as you don't have any mass in the world,\n\n1:12:34.460 --> 1:12:36.460\n infinity is just another place.\n\n1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:39.700\n The photons get there, the gravitons get there.\n\n1:12:39.700 --> 1:12:40.540\n What do they get?\n\n1:12:40.540 --> 1:12:42.100\n They've run into infinity.\n\n1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:44.300\n They say, well, now I'm here, what do I?\n\n1:12:44.300 --> 1:12:46.660\n There's something on the other side, is there?\n\n1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:48.620\n The usual view, it's just a mathematical notion.\n\n1:12:48.620 --> 1:12:49.620\n There's nothing on the other side.\n\n1:12:49.620 --> 1:12:51.740\n That's just the boundary of it.\n\n1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:54.980\n A nice example is this beautiful series of pictures\n\n1:12:54.980 --> 1:12:57.180\n by the Dutch artist MC Escher.\n\n1:12:57.180 --> 1:12:58.020\n You may know them.\n\n1:12:58.020 --> 1:12:59.660\n The one's called Circle Limits.\n\n1:12:59.660 --> 1:13:02.500\n They're a very famous one with the angels and the devils.\n\n1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.220\n And you can see them crowding and crowding\n\n1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:06.020\n and crowding up to the edge.\n\n1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:09.060\n Now, the kind of geometry that these angels and devils\n\n1:13:09.060 --> 1:13:11.500\n inhabit, that's their infinity.\n\n1:13:12.380 --> 1:13:16.820\n But from our perspective, infinity is just a place.\n\n1:13:16.820 --> 1:13:17.660\n Okay, there is...\n\n1:13:17.660 --> 1:13:20.220\n I'm sorry, can you just take a brief pause?\n\n1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:21.060\n Yes.\n\n1:13:21.060 --> 1:13:22.860\n In just the words you're saying,\n\n1:13:22.860 --> 1:13:24.100\n infinity is just a place.\n\n1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:28.820\n So for the most part, infinity, sort of even just going back,\n\n1:13:28.820 --> 1:13:31.220\n infinity is a mathematical concept.\n\n1:13:31.220 --> 1:13:32.060\n I think this is one of the things...\n\n1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:35.500\n You think there's an actual physical manifest...\n\n1:13:35.500 --> 1:13:38.420\n In which way does infinity ever manifest itself\n\n1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:40.140\n in our physical universe?\n\n1:13:40.140 --> 1:13:41.820\n Well, it does in various places.\n\n1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:44.500\n You see, it's a thing that if you're not a mathematician,\n\n1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:46.500\n you think, oh, infinity, I can't think about that.\n\n1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:48.700\n Mathematicians think about affinity all the time.\n\n1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:50.940\n They get used to the idea and they just play around\n\n1:13:50.940 --> 1:13:52.340\n with different kinds of infinities\n\n1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:54.220\n and it becomes no problem.\n\n1:13:54.220 --> 1:13:57.260\n But you just have to take my word for it.\n\n1:13:57.260 --> 1:13:58.500\n Now, one of the things is,\n\n1:13:58.500 --> 1:14:00.820\n you see, you take a Euclidean geometry.\n\n1:14:00.820 --> 1:14:04.660\n Well, it just keeps on going and it goes out to infinity.\n\n1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:06.180\n Now, there's other kinds of geometry\n\n1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:09.260\n and this is what's called hyperbolic geometry.\n\n1:14:09.260 --> 1:14:10.820\n It's a bit like Euclidean geometry,\n\n1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:12.140\n it's a little bit different.\n\n1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:14.660\n It's like what Escher was trying to describe\n\n1:14:14.660 --> 1:14:17.260\n in his angels and devils.\n\n1:14:17.260 --> 1:14:19.700\n And he learned about this from Coxeter\n\n1:14:19.700 --> 1:14:21.780\n and he think that's a very nice thing.\n\n1:14:21.780 --> 1:14:24.060\n That's why I represent this infinity\n\n1:14:24.060 --> 1:14:25.820\n to this kind of geometry.\n\n1:14:25.820 --> 1:14:27.140\n So it's not quite Euclidean geometry,\n\n1:14:27.140 --> 1:14:28.300\n it's a bit like it,\n\n1:14:28.300 --> 1:14:30.900\n that the angels and the devils inhabit.\n\n1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:34.180\n And their infinity, by this nice transformation,\n\n1:14:34.180 --> 1:14:36.820\n you squash their infinity down\n\n1:14:36.820 --> 1:14:39.580\n so you can draw it as this nice circle boundary\n\n1:14:39.580 --> 1:14:42.220\n to their universe.\n\n1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:44.260\n Now, from our outside perspective,\n\n1:14:44.260 --> 1:14:47.420\n we can see their infinity as this boundary.\n\n1:14:47.420 --> 1:14:50.540\n Now, what I'm saying is that it's very like that.\n\n1:14:50.540 --> 1:14:53.540\n The infinity that we might experience\n\n1:14:53.540 --> 1:14:56.180\n like those angels and devils in their world\n\n1:14:56.180 --> 1:14:59.460\n can be thought of as a boundary.\n\n1:14:59.460 --> 1:15:01.940\n Now, I found this a very useful way\n\n1:15:01.940 --> 1:15:03.940\n of talking about radiation,\n\n1:15:03.940 --> 1:15:07.100\n gravitational radiation and things like that.\n\n1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:10.020\n It was a trick, mathematical trick.\n\n1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:11.340\n So now what I'm saying is that\n\n1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:14.940\n that mathematical trick becomes real.\n\n1:15:14.940 --> 1:15:17.860\n That somehow, the photons,\n\n1:15:17.860 --> 1:15:19.980\n they need to go somewhere\n\n1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:22.780\n because from their perspective,\n\n1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:25.060\n infinity is just another place.\n\n1:15:25.060 --> 1:15:28.340\n Now, this is a difficult idea to get your mind around.\n\n1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:31.660\n So that's one of the reasons cosmologists\n\n1:15:31.660 --> 1:15:34.820\n are finding a lot of trouble taking me seriously.\n\n1:15:34.820 --> 1:15:37.540\n But to me, it's not such a wild idea.\n\n1:15:37.540 --> 1:15:39.780\n What's on the other side of that infinity?\n\n1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:43.060\n You have to think, why am I allowed to think of this?\n\n1:15:43.060 --> 1:15:45.340\n Why am I allowed to think of this?\n\n1:15:45.340 --> 1:15:48.940\n Because photons don't have any mass.\n\n1:15:48.940 --> 1:15:53.620\n And we in physics have beautiful ways of measuring time.\n\n1:15:53.620 --> 1:15:55.940\n There are incredibly precise clocks,\n\n1:15:55.940 --> 1:15:59.620\n atomic and nuclear clocks, unbelievably precise.\n\n1:15:59.620 --> 1:16:01.660\n Why are they so precise?\n\n1:16:01.660 --> 1:16:04.660\n Because of the two most famous equations\n\n1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:06.820\n of 20th century physics.\n\n1:16:06.820 --> 1:16:10.060\n One of them is Einstein's E equals MC squared.\n\n1:16:10.060 --> 1:16:11.100\n What's that tell us?\n\n1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:13.980\n Energy and mass are equivalent.\n\n1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:16.660\n The other one is even older than that,\n\n1:16:16.660 --> 1:16:18.540\n still 20th century, only just.\n\n1:16:18.540 --> 1:16:22.660\n Max Planck, E equals h nu.\n\n1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:24.420\n Nu is a frequency,\n\n1:16:24.420 --> 1:16:26.460\n h is a constant, again, like C.\n\n1:16:26.460 --> 1:16:28.020\n E is energy.\n\n1:16:28.020 --> 1:16:30.660\n Energy and frequency are equivalent.\n\n1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:33.060\n Put the two together,\n\n1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:34.980\n energy and mass are equivalent, Einstein.\n\n1:16:34.980 --> 1:16:37.340\n Energy and frequency are equivalent, Max Planck.\n\n1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:41.420\n Put the two together, mass and frequency are equivalent.\n\n1:16:41.420 --> 1:16:44.100\n Absolutely basic physical principle.\n\n1:16:44.100 --> 1:16:47.500\n If you have a massive entity, a massive particle,\n\n1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:51.980\n it is a clock with a very, very precise frequency.\n\n1:16:53.460 --> 1:16:55.020\n It's not, you can't directly use it,\n\n1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:56.140\n you have to scale it down.\n\n1:16:56.140 --> 1:16:57.660\n So your atomic and nuclear clocks,\n\n1:16:57.660 --> 1:16:59.180\n but that's the basic principle.\n\n1:16:59.180 --> 1:17:02.260\n You scale it down to something you can actually perceive.\n\n1:17:02.260 --> 1:17:03.860\n But it's the same principle.\n\n1:17:03.860 --> 1:17:07.900\n If you have mass, you have beautiful clocks.\n\n1:17:07.900 --> 1:17:10.340\n But the other side of that coin is,\n\n1:17:10.340 --> 1:17:13.940\n if you don't have mass, you don't have clocks.\n\n1:17:14.820 --> 1:17:18.060\n If you don't have clocks, you don't have rulers.\n\n1:17:18.060 --> 1:17:20.180\n You don't have scale.\n\n1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:21.380\n So you don't have space and time.\n\n1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:24.820\n You don't have a measure of the scale of space and time.\n\n1:17:24.820 --> 1:17:26.500\n Oh, scale of space and time.\n\n1:17:26.500 --> 1:17:29.180\n You do have the structure,\n\n1:17:29.180 --> 1:17:30.860\n what's called the conformal structure.\n\n1:17:30.860 --> 1:17:33.100\n You see, it's what the angels and devils have.\n\n1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:35.060\n If you look at the eye of the devil,\n\n1:17:35.060 --> 1:17:36.900\n no matter how close to the boundary it is,\n\n1:17:36.900 --> 1:17:40.820\n it has the same shape, but it has a different size.\n\n1:17:40.820 --> 1:17:43.380\n So you can scale up and you can scale down,\n\n1:17:43.380 --> 1:17:45.340\n but you mustn't change the shape.\n\n1:17:46.420 --> 1:17:48.540\n So it's basically the same idea,\n\n1:17:48.540 --> 1:17:50.780\n but applied to space time now.\n\n1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:52.620\n In the very remote future,\n\n1:17:52.620 --> 1:17:55.700\n you have things which don't measure the scale,\n\n1:17:55.700 --> 1:17:58.460\n but the shape, if you like, is still there.\n\n1:17:58.460 --> 1:17:59.940\n Now that's in the remote future.\n\n1:17:59.940 --> 1:18:01.980\n Now I'm gonna do the exact opposite.\n\n1:18:01.980 --> 1:18:04.660\n Now I'm gonna go way back into the Big Bang.\n\n1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:08.100\n Now as you get there, things get hotter and hotter,\n\n1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:09.420\n denser and denser.\n\n1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:13.020\n What's the universe dominated by?\n\n1:18:13.020 --> 1:18:16.580\n Particles moving around almost with the speed of light.\n\n1:18:16.580 --> 1:18:19.060\n When they get almost with the speed of light,\n\n1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:21.820\n okay, they begin to lose the mass too.\n\n1:18:21.820 --> 1:18:24.260\n So for completely opposite reason,\n\n1:18:24.260 --> 1:18:26.900\n they lose the sense of scale as well.\n\n1:18:26.900 --> 1:18:31.900\n So my crazy idea is the Big Bang and the remote future,\n\n1:18:32.260 --> 1:18:33.500\n they seem completely different.\n\n1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:36.140\n One is extremely dense, extremely hot.\n\n1:18:36.140 --> 1:18:39.820\n The other is very, very rarefied and very, very cold.\n\n1:18:39.820 --> 1:18:42.860\n But if you squash one down by this conformal scaling,\n\n1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:44.340\n you get the other.\n\n1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:48.020\n So although they look and feel very different,\n\n1:18:48.020 --> 1:18:50.460\n they're really almost the same.\n\n1:18:50.460 --> 1:18:53.180\n The remote future on the other side,\n\n1:18:53.180 --> 1:18:55.620\n I'm claiming is that where do the photons go?\n\n1:18:55.620 --> 1:18:57.260\n They go into the next Big Bang.\n\n1:18:58.740 --> 1:19:01.260\n You've got to get your mind around that crazy idea.\n\n1:19:01.260 --> 1:19:03.820\n Taking a step on the other side of the place\n\n1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:05.660\n that is infinity.\n\n1:19:05.660 --> 1:19:07.260\n Okay, but.\n\n1:19:07.260 --> 1:19:09.100\n So I'm saying the other side of our Big Bang,\n\n1:19:09.100 --> 1:19:10.620\n now I'm going back into the Big Bang.\n\n1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:11.460\n Back, backwards.\n\n1:19:11.460 --> 1:19:13.820\n There was the remote future of a previous eon.\n\n1:19:13.820 --> 1:19:15.140\n Previous eon.\n\n1:19:15.140 --> 1:19:17.620\n And what I'm saying is that previous eon,\n\n1:19:17.620 --> 1:19:20.300\n there are signals coming through to us,\n\n1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:23.860\n which we can see and which we do see.\n\n1:19:23.860 --> 1:19:25.180\n And these are both signals,\n\n1:19:25.180 --> 1:19:29.540\n the two main signals are to do with black holes.\n\n1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:33.140\n One of them is the collisions between black holes.\n\n1:19:33.140 --> 1:19:35.300\n And as they spiral into each other,\n\n1:19:35.300 --> 1:19:37.060\n they release a lot of energy\n\n1:19:37.060 --> 1:19:39.220\n in the form of gravitational waves.\n\n1:19:39.220 --> 1:19:42.300\n Those gravitational waves get through\n\n1:19:42.300 --> 1:19:44.260\n in a certain form into the next eon.\n\n1:19:44.260 --> 1:19:46.340\n That's fascinating that there's some,\n\n1:19:46.340 --> 1:19:49.140\n I mean, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n1:19:49.140 --> 1:19:52.100\n but that means that some information can travel\n\n1:19:52.100 --> 1:19:53.420\n from another eon.\n\n1:19:53.420 --> 1:19:54.340\n Exactly.\n\n1:19:54.340 --> 1:19:58.860\n That is fascinating.\n\n1:19:58.860 --> 1:20:01.700\n I mean, I've seen somewhere described\n\n1:20:01.700 --> 1:20:05.340\n sort of the discussion of the Fermi Paradox,\n\n1:20:05.340 --> 1:20:08.260\n you know, that if there's intelligent life.\n\n1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:09.100\n Yes.\n\n1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:12.140\n Being, you know, communication immediately takes you there.\n\n1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:13.180\n So.\n\n1:20:13.180 --> 1:20:16.020\n We have a paper, I have my colleague,\n\n1:20:16.020 --> 1:20:19.820\n Vahid Guzajan, who I worked with on these ideas for a while.\n\n1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:21.740\n We have a crazy paper on that, yes.\n\n1:20:21.740 --> 1:20:22.580\n So.\n\n1:20:22.580 --> 1:20:23.540\n Looking at the Fermi Paradox, yes.\n\n1:20:23.540 --> 1:20:25.980\n Right, so if the universe is just cycling\n\n1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:27.260\n over and over and over,\n\n1:20:27.260 --> 1:20:31.660\n punctuated by the, punctuated the singularity\n\n1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:32.780\n of the Big Bang,\n\n1:20:32.780 --> 1:20:36.780\n and then intelligent or any kind of intelligent systems\n\n1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:39.580\n can communicate through from eon to eon,\n\n1:20:39.580 --> 1:20:44.580\n why haven't we heard anything from our alien friends?\n\n1:20:44.700 --> 1:20:46.980\n Because we don't know how to look.\n\n1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:48.900\n That's fundamentally the reason, is we.\n\n1:20:48.900 --> 1:20:51.820\n I don't know, you see, it's speculation.\n\n1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:55.460\n I mean, the SETI program is a reasonable thing to do,\n\n1:20:55.460 --> 1:20:56.940\n but still speculation.\n\n1:20:56.940 --> 1:21:01.860\n It's trying to say, okay, maybe not too far away\n\n1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:05.620\n was a civilization which got there first, before us,\n\n1:21:05.620 --> 1:21:08.740\n early enough that they could send us signals,\n\n1:21:08.740 --> 1:21:11.060\n but how far away would you need to go before,\n\n1:21:11.060 --> 1:21:13.340\n I mean, I don't know, we have so little knowledge\n\n1:21:13.340 --> 1:21:15.820\n about that, we haven't seen any signals yet,\n\n1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:18.260\n but it's worth looking, it's worth looking.\n\n1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:21.380\n What I'm trying to say, here's another possible place\n\n1:21:21.380 --> 1:21:22.580\n where you might look.\n\n1:21:22.580 --> 1:21:24.620\n Now you're not looking at civilizations\n\n1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:26.220\n which got there first,\n\n1:21:26.220 --> 1:21:27.980\n you're looking at those civilizations\n\n1:21:27.980 --> 1:21:29.180\n which were so successful,\n\n1:21:29.180 --> 1:21:32.420\n probably a lot more successful than they're likely to be\n\n1:21:32.420 --> 1:21:33.580\n by the looks of things,\n\n1:21:34.900 --> 1:21:38.100\n which knew how to handle their own global warming\n\n1:21:38.100 --> 1:21:40.460\n or whatever it is and to get through it all\n\n1:21:40.460 --> 1:21:45.460\n and to live to a ripe old age in the sense of a civilization\n\n1:21:45.460 --> 1:21:49.180\n to the extent that they could harness signals\n\n1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:52.340\n that they could propagate through for some reason\n\n1:21:52.340 --> 1:21:55.700\n of their own desires, whatever we wouldn't know\n\n1:21:55.700 --> 1:21:57.780\n to other civilizations\n\n1:21:57.780 --> 1:22:00.180\n which might be able to pick up the signals.\n\n1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:01.980\n But what kind of signals would they be?\n\n1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:03.260\n I haven't the foggiest.\n\n1:22:05.180 --> 1:22:06.460\n Let me ask the question.\n\n1:22:06.460 --> 1:22:07.300\n Yes.\n\n1:22:07.300 --> 1:22:09.060\n What to you is the most beautiful idea\n\n1:22:09.060 --> 1:22:12.620\n in physics or mathematics or the art\n\n1:22:12.620 --> 1:22:14.180\n at the intersection of the two?\n\n1:22:15.100 --> 1:22:17.180\n I'm gonna have to say complex analysis.\n\n1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:19.620\n I might've said infinities.\n\n1:22:19.620 --> 1:22:22.620\n And one of the most single, most beautiful idea\n\n1:22:22.620 --> 1:22:24.460\n I think was the fact that you can have\n\n1:22:24.460 --> 1:22:26.860\n infinities of different sizes and so on.\n\n1:22:26.860 --> 1:22:30.380\n But that's in a way, I think complex analysis.\n\n1:22:30.380 --> 1:22:32.940\n It's got so much magic in it.\n\n1:22:32.940 --> 1:22:34.860\n It's a very simple idea.\n\n1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:39.460\n You take these, you take numbers,\n\n1:22:39.460 --> 1:22:41.820\n you take the integers and then you fill them up\n\n1:22:41.820 --> 1:22:44.180\n into the fractions and the real numbers.\n\n1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:46.780\n You imagine you're trying to measure a continuous line\n\n1:22:46.780 --> 1:22:50.420\n and then you think of how you can solve equations.\n\n1:22:50.420 --> 1:22:53.420\n Then what about X squared equals minus one?\n\n1:22:54.460 --> 1:22:57.460\n Well, there's no real number which has to satisfy that.\n\n1:22:57.460 --> 1:23:01.340\n So you have to think of, well, there's a number called I.\n\n1:23:01.340 --> 1:23:02.340\n You think you invent it.\n\n1:23:02.340 --> 1:23:05.180\n Well, in a certain sense, it's there already.\n\n1:23:05.180 --> 1:23:07.460\n But this number, when you add that square root\n\n1:23:07.460 --> 1:23:08.300\n of minus one to it,\n\n1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:10.940\n you have what's called the complex numbers.\n\n1:23:10.940 --> 1:23:12.740\n And they're an incredible system.\n\n1:23:13.860 --> 1:23:15.700\n If you like, you put one little thing in,\n\n1:23:15.700 --> 1:23:17.340\n you put square root of minus one in\n\n1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:20.620\n and you get how much benefit out of it.\n\n1:23:20.620 --> 1:23:23.420\n All sorts of things that you'd never imagined before.\n\n1:23:23.420 --> 1:23:27.740\n And it's that amazing, all hiding there\n\n1:23:27.740 --> 1:23:30.140\n in putting that square root of minus one in.\n\n1:23:30.140 --> 1:23:32.660\n I think that's the most magical thing I've seen\n\n1:23:32.660 --> 1:23:34.020\n in mathematics or physics.\n\n1:23:34.020 --> 1:23:35.580\n And it's in quantum mechanics.\n\n1:23:35.580 --> 1:23:36.420\n And in quantum mechanics.\n\n1:23:36.420 --> 1:23:38.220\n You see, it's there already.\n\n1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:39.700\n You might think, what's it doing there?\n\n1:23:39.700 --> 1:23:41.660\n Okay, just a nice beautiful piece of mathematics.\n\n1:23:41.660 --> 1:23:44.180\n And then suddenly we see, nope.\n\n1:23:44.180 --> 1:23:47.220\n It's the very crucial basis of quantum mechanics.\n\n1:23:47.220 --> 1:23:49.540\n It's there and the way the world works.\n\n1:23:49.540 --> 1:23:50.980\n So on the question of whether math\n\n1:23:50.980 --> 1:23:52.820\n is discovered or invented,\n\n1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:54.620\n it sounds like you may be suggesting\n\n1:23:54.620 --> 1:23:56.180\n that partially it's possible\n\n1:23:56.180 --> 1:23:57.860\n that math is indeed discovered.\n\n1:23:57.860 --> 1:23:59.660\n Oh, absolutely, yes.\n\n1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:02.180\n No, it's more like archeology than you might think.\n\n1:24:02.180 --> 1:24:03.900\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:24:03.900 --> 1:24:06.580\n So let me ask the most ridiculous,\n\n1:24:06.580 --> 1:24:08.660\n maybe the most important question.\n\n1:24:08.660 --> 1:24:11.580\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n1:24:11.580 --> 1:24:15.060\n What gives your life fulfillment, purpose,\n\n1:24:15.060 --> 1:24:16.020\n happiness, and meaning?\n\n1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:18.260\n Why do you think we're here on this?\n\n1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:20.980\n Given all the big bang and the infinities of photons\n\n1:24:20.980 --> 1:24:21.820\n that we've talked about.\n\n1:24:21.820 --> 1:24:24.340\n All I would say, I think it's not a stupid question.\n\n1:24:26.620 --> 1:24:28.180\n I mean, there are some people, you know,\n\n1:24:28.180 --> 1:24:29.780\n many of my colleagues who are scientists,\n\n1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:31.340\n and they say, well, that's a stupid question,\n\n1:24:31.340 --> 1:24:32.540\n meaning, yeah, well, we're just here\n\n1:24:32.540 --> 1:24:35.420\n because things came together and produced life\n\n1:24:35.420 --> 1:24:36.260\n and so what.\n\n1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:39.260\n I think there's more to it.\n\n1:24:39.260 --> 1:24:41.100\n But what there is that's more to it,\n\n1:24:41.100 --> 1:24:43.140\n I have really much idea.\n\n1:24:43.140 --> 1:24:44.420\n And it might be somehow connected\n\n1:24:44.420 --> 1:24:46.300\n to the mechanisms of consciousness\n\n1:24:46.300 --> 1:24:49.540\n that we've been talking about, the mystery there.\n\n1:24:49.540 --> 1:24:51.060\n It's connected with all sorts of, yeah,\n\n1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:53.660\n I think these things are tied up in ways which are,\n\n1:24:54.900 --> 1:24:56.780\n you see, I tend to think the mystery of consciousness\n\n1:24:56.780 --> 1:25:00.980\n is tied up with the mystery of quantum mechanics\n\n1:25:00.980 --> 1:25:04.020\n and how it fits in with the classical world,\n\n1:25:04.020 --> 1:25:07.460\n and that's all to do with the mystery of complex numbers.\n\n1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:10.700\n And there are mysteries there\n\n1:25:10.700 --> 1:25:13.060\n which look like mathematical mysteries,\n\n1:25:13.060 --> 1:25:15.740\n but they seem to have a bearing\n\n1:25:15.740 --> 1:25:17.740\n on the way the physical world operates.\n\n1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:20.780\n We're scratching the surface.\n\n1:25:20.780 --> 1:25:22.980\n We have a long, huge way to go\n\n1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:24.820\n before we really understand that.\n\n1:25:24.820 --> 1:25:28.340\n And it's a beautiful idea that the depth,\n\n1:25:28.340 --> 1:25:30.700\n the mathematical depth could be discovered,\n\n1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:32.940\n and then there's tragedies of ghettos\n\n1:25:32.940 --> 1:25:34.460\n and completeness along the way\n\n1:25:34.460 --> 1:25:37.540\n that we'll have to somehow figure our ways around.\n\n1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:38.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:38.900 --> 1:25:42.100\n So, Roger, it was a huge honor to talk to you.\n\n1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:43.500\n Thank you so much for your time today.\n\n1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:44.540\n It's been my pleasure.\n\n1:25:44.540 --> 1:25:46.100\n Thank you.\n\n1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:47.620\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:25:47.620 --> 1:25:48.980\n with Roger Penrose,\n\n1:25:48.980 --> 1:25:52.020\n and thank you to our presenting sponsor, Cash App.\n\n1:25:52.020 --> 1:25:53.940\n

wisdom\n\n1:26:17.020 --> 1:26:19.340\n that Roger Penrose wrote in his book,\n\n1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:20.580\n The Emperor's New Mind.\n\n1:26:21.660 --> 1:26:24.460\n Beneath all this technicality is the feeling\n\n1:26:24.460 --> 1:26:28.060\n that it is indeed, quote unquote, obvious\n\n1:26:28.060 --> 1:26:31.220\n that the conscious mind cannot work like a computer,\n\n1:26:31.220 --> 1:26:33.060\n even though much of what is involved\n\n1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:35.460\n in mental activity might do so.\n\n1:26:35.460 --> 1:26:39.580\n This is the kind of obviousness that a child can see,\n\n1:26:39.580 --> 1:26:42.740\n though the child may later in life become browbeaten\n\n1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:44.820\n into believing that the obvious problems\n\n1:26:44.820 --> 1:26:47.260\n are quote unquote, non problems,\n\n1:26:47.260 --> 1:26:51.060\n to be argued into nonexistence by careful reasoning\n\n1:26:51.060 --> 1:26:52.900\n and clever choices of definition.\n\n1:26:53.820 --> 1:26:56.540\n Children sometimes see things clearly\n\n1:26:56.540 --> 1:26:59.100\n that are obscured in later life.\n\n1:26:59.100 --> 1:27:02.460\n We often forget the wonder that we felt as children\n\n1:27:02.460 --> 1:27:05.300\n when the cares of the quote unquote, real world\n\n1:27:05.300 --> 1:27:07.860\n had begun to settle on our shoulders.\n\n1:27:07.860 --> 1:27:10.540\n Children are not afraid to pose basic questions\n\n1:27:10.540 --> 1:27:13.620\n that may embarrass us as adults to ask.\n\n1:27:13.620 --> 1:27:15.740\n What happens to each of our streams of consciousness\n\n1:27:15.740 --> 1:27:17.220\n after we die?\n\n1:27:17.220 --> 1:27:19.580\n Where was it before we were born?\n\n1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:23.220\n Might we become or have been someone else?\n\n1:27:23.220 --> 1:27:25.180\n Why do we perceive it all?\n\n1:27:25.180 --> 1:27:26.900\n Why are we here?\n\n1:27:26.900 --> 1:27:28.620\n Why is there a universe here at all\n\n1:27:28.620 --> 1:27:30.900\n in which we can actually be?\n\n1:27:30.900 --> 1:27:32.660\n These are puzzles that tend to come\n\n1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:35.980\n with the awakenings of awareness in any of us\n\n1:27:35.980 --> 1:27:39.980\n and no doubt with the awakening of self awareness\n\n1:27:39.980 --> 1:27:43.700\n within whichever creature or other entity it first came.\n\n1:27:43.700 --> 1:28:01.700\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
