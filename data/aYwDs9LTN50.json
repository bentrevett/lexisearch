  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.120\n The following is a conversation with Stephen Schwarzman,\n\n00:03.120 --> 00:05.760\n CEO and cofounder of Blackstone,\n\n00:05.760 --> 00:08.240\n one of the world's leading investment firms\n\n00:08.240 --> 00:12.920\n with over $530 billion of assets under management.\n\n00:12.920 --> 00:17.880\n He's one of the most successful business leaders in history.\n\n00:17.880 --> 00:20.920\n I recommend his recent book called What It Takes\n\n00:20.920 --> 00:24.440\n that tells stories and lessons from his personal journey.\n\n00:24.440 --> 00:26.320\n Stephen is a philanthropist\n\n00:26.320 --> 00:28.680\n and one of the wealthiest people in the world,\n\n00:28.680 --> 00:31.200\n recently signing the Giving Pledge,\n\n00:31.200 --> 00:33.840\n thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth\n\n00:33.840 --> 00:36.080\n to philanthropic causes.\n\n00:36.080 --> 00:41.080\n As an example, in 2018, he donated $350 million to MIT\n\n00:41.920 --> 00:45.160\n to help establish his new College of Computing,\n\n00:45.160 --> 00:48.160\n the mission of which promotes interdisciplinary, big,\n\n00:48.160 --> 00:51.880\n bold research in artificial intelligence.\n\n00:51.880 --> 00:53.280\n For those of you who know me,\n\n00:53.280 --> 00:55.840\n know that MIT is near and dear to my heart\n\n00:55.840 --> 00:57.400\n and always will be.\n\n00:57.400 --> 01:01.400\n It was and is a place where I believe big, bold,\n\n01:01.400 --> 01:03.520\n revolutionary ideas have a home,\n\n01:03.520 --> 01:05.040\n and that is what is needed\n\n01:05.040 --> 01:08.320\n in artificial intelligence research in the coming decades.\n\n01:08.320 --> 01:11.120\n Yes, there's institutional challenges,\n\n01:11.120 --> 01:13.200\n but also there's power\n\n01:13.200 --> 01:15.600\n in the passion of individual researchers,\n\n01:15.600 --> 01:17.600\n from undergrad to PhD,\n\n01:17.600 --> 01:20.480\n from young scientists to senior faculty.\n\n01:20.480 --> 01:23.560\n I believe the dream to build intelligence systems\n\n01:23.560 --> 01:26.400\n burns brighter than ever in the halls of MIT.\n\n01:26.400 --> 01:28.600\n This conversation was recorded recently,\n\n01:28.600 --> 01:31.040\n but before the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n01:31.040 --> 01:33.200\n For everyone feeling the burden of this crisis,\n\n01:33.200 --> 01:35.080\n I'm sending love your way.\n\n01:35.080 --> 01:37.360\n Stay strong, we're in this together.\n\n01:38.480 --> 01:41.000\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:41.000 -->

now,\n\n01:55.120 --> 01:56.800\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n01:56.800 --> 01:58.960\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:58.960 --> 02:00.280\n I hope that works for you,\n\n02:00.280 --> 02:02.200\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n02:02.200 --> 02:03.720\n Quick summary of the ads.\n\n02:03.720 --> 02:07.320\n Two sponsors, Masterclass and

Schwarzman.\n\n04:17.640 --> 04:19.720\n Let's start with a tough question.\n\n04:19.720 --> 04:21.840\n What idea do you believe,\n\n04:21.840 --> 04:24.880\n whether grounded in data or in intuition,\n\n04:24.880 --> 04:27.540\n that many people you respect disagree with you on?\n\n04:28.640 --> 04:32.140\n Well, there isn't all that much anymore\n\n04:32.140 --> 04:34.800\n since the world's so transparent.\n\n04:34.800 --> 04:39.800\n But one of the things I believe in and put it in the book,\n\n04:39.800 --> 04:43.920\n the book, what it takes is if you're gonna do something,\n\n04:43.920 --> 04:46.200\n do something very consequential.\n\n04:46.200 --> 04:51.040\n Do something that's quite large, if you can, that's unique.\n\n04:51.040 --> 04:54.240\n Because if you operate in that kind of space,\n\n04:54.240 --> 04:57.760\n when you're successful, it's a huge impact.\n\n04:57.760 --> 05:02.440\n The prospect of success enables you to recruit people\n\n05:02.440 --> 05:04.320\n who wanna be part of that.\n\n05:04.320 --> 05:06.840\n And those type of large opportunities\n\n05:06.840 --> 05:09.480\n are pretty easily described.\n\n05:09.480 --> 05:14.480\n And so, not everybody likes to operate at scale.\n\n05:14.520 --> 05:16.160\n Some people like to do small things\n\n05:16.160 --> 05:21.160\n because it is meaningful for them emotionally.\n\n05:21.320 --> 05:25.400\n And so, occasionally, you get a disagreement on that.\n\n05:25.400 --> 05:30.000\n But those are life choices rather than commercial choices.\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:31.000\n That's interesting.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:34.880\n What good and bad comes with going big?\n\n05:34.880 --> 05:39.880\n We often, in America, think big is good.\n\n05:41.320 --> 05:44.040\n What's the benefit, what's the cost\n\n05:44.040 --> 05:45.920\n in terms of just bigger than business,\n\n05:45.920 --> 05:49.160\n but life, happiness, the pursuit of happiness?\n\n05:49.160 --> 05:51.840\n Well, you do things that make you happy.\n\n05:51.840 --> 05:53.640\n It's not mandated.\n\n05:53.640 --> 05:56.040\n And everybody's different.\n\n05:56.040 --> 06:00.720\n And some people, if they have talent,\n\n06:00.720 --> 06:02.480\n like playing pro football,\n\n06:02.480 --> 06:06.200\n other people just like throwing the ball around,\n\n06:07.240 --> 06:09.040\n not even being on a team.\n\n06:09.040 --> 06:10.760\n What's better?\n\n06:10.760 --> 06:12.360\n Depends what your objectives are.\n\n06:12.360 --> 06:14.080\n Depends what your talent is.\n\n06:15.440 --> 06:19.720\n Depends what gives you joy.\n\n06:19.720 --> 06:21.520\n So, in terms of going big,\n\n06:21.520 --> 06:24.200\n is it both for impact on the world\n\n06:24.200 --> 06:27.640\n and because you personally gives you joy?\n\n06:27.640 --> 06:31.960\n Well, it makes it easier to succeed, actually.\n\n06:31.960 --> 06:35.040\n Because if you catch something, for example,\n\n06:35.040 --> 06:39.600\n that's cyclical, that's a huge opportunity,\n\n06:39.600 --> 06:42.680\n then you usually can find some place\n\n06:42.680 --> 06:46.960\n within that huge opportunity where you can make it work.\n\n06:46.960 --> 06:51.440\n If you're prosecuting a really small thing\n\n06:51.440 --> 06:56.200\n and you're wrong, you don't have many places to go.\n\n06:56.200 --> 07:00.320\n So, I've always found that the easy place to be\n\n07:00.320 --> 07:05.320\n and the ability where you can concentrate human resources,\n\n07:07.720 --> 07:12.720\n get people excited about doing really impactful big things,\n\n07:13.240 --> 07:16.520\n and you can afford to pay them, actually.\n\n07:16.520 --> 07:20.720\n Because the bigger thing can generate much more\n\n07:20.720 --> 07:24.880\n in the way of financial resources.\n\n07:24.880 --> 07:28.480\n So, that brings people out of talent to help you.\n\n07:28.480 --> 07:33.480\n And so, all together, it's a virtuous circle, I think.\n\n07:34.280 --> 07:37.240\n How do you know an opportunity when you see one\n\n07:37.240 --> 07:40.200\n in terms of the one you wanna go big on?\n\n07:40.200 --> 07:42.680\n Is it intuition, is it facts?\n\n07:43.640 --> 07:48.640\n Is it back and forth deliberation with people you trust?\n\n07:48.800 --> 07:50.640\n What's the process?\n\n07:50.640 --> 07:52.640\n Is it art, is it science?\n\n07:52.640 --> 07:54.200\n Well, it's pattern recognition.\n\n07:55.360 --> 07:57.720\n And how do you get to pattern recognition?\n\n07:57.720 --> 08:00.200\n First, you need to understand the patterns\n\n08:00.200 --> 08:02.920\n and the changes that are happening.\n\n08:02.920 --> 08:07.920\n And that's either, it's observational on some level.\n\n08:08.760 --> 08:13.760\n You can call it data or you can just call it listening\n\n08:14.680 --> 08:18.040\n to unusual things that people are saying\n\n08:18.040 --> 08:19.960\n that they haven't said before.\n\n08:19.960 --> 08:24.320\n And I've always tried to describe this.\n\n08:24.320 --> 08:29.320\n It's like seeing a piece of white lint on a black dress.\n\n08:29.440 --> 08:33.280\n But most people disregard that piece of lint.\n\n08:33.280 --> 08:34.920\n They just see the dress.\n\n08:34.920 --> 08:37.080\n I always see the lint.\n\n08:37.080 --> 08:41.720\n And I'm fascinated by how did something get someplace\n\n08:41.720 --> 08:43.480\n it's not supposed to be?\n\n08:43.480 --> 08:47.120\n So, it doesn't even need to be a big discrepancy.\n\n08:47.120 --> 08:49.880\n But if something shouldn't be someplace\n\n08:49.880 --> 08:54.880\n in a constellation of facts that sort of made sense\n\n08:56.360 --> 09:01.360\n in a traditional way, I've learned that if you focus\n\n09:01.360 --> 09:05.920\n on why one discordant note is there,\n\n09:05.920 --> 09:09.480\n that's usually a key to something important.\n\n09:09.480 --> 09:14.480\n And if you can find two of those discordant notes,\n\n09:14.720 --> 09:17.680\n that's usually a straight line to someplace.\n\n09:17.680 --> 09:20.480\n And that someplace is not where you've been.\n\n09:20.480 --> 09:24.360\n And usually when you figure out that things are changing\n\n09:24.360 --> 09:27.360\n or have changed and you describe them,\n\n09:27.360 --> 09:29.160\n which you have to be able to do\n\n09:29.160 --> 09:33.240\n because it's not some odd intuition.\n\n09:33.240 --> 09:35.680\n It's just focusing on facts.\n\n09:35.680 --> 09:39.000\n It's almost like a scientific discovery, if you will.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.280\n When you describe it to other people in the real world,\n\n09:42.280 --> 09:46.840\n they tend to do absolutely nothing about it.\n\n09:46.840 --> 09:51.160\n And that's because humans are comfortable\n\n09:51.160 --> 09:53.120\n in their own reality.\n\n09:53.120 --> 09:57.400\n And if there's no particular reason at that moment\n\n09:57.400 --> 10:00.080\n to shake them out of their reality,\n\n10:00.080 --> 10:03.600\n they'll stay in it even if they're ultimately\n\n10:03.600 --> 10:05.320\n completely wrong.\n\n10:05.320 --> 10:09.120\n And I've always been stunned that when I explain\n\n10:09.120 --> 10:13.000\n where we're going, what we're doing and why,\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\n almost everyone just says, that's interesting.\n\n10:18.160 --> 10:20.640\n And they continue doing what they're doing.\n\n10:20.640 --> 10:24.920\n And so I think it's pretty easy to do that.\n\n10:26.440 --> 10:29.000\n But what you need is a huge data set.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:33.280\n So before AI and people's focus on data,\n\n10:33.280 --> 10:36.160\n I've sort of been doing this mostly my whole life.\n\n10:36.160 --> 10:40.400\n I'm not a scientist, I'm not let alone a computer scientist.\n\n10:40.400 --> 10:43.320\n And you can just hear what people are saying\n\n10:43.320 --> 10:46.280\n when somebody says something or you observe something\n\n10:46.280 --> 10:48.480\n that simply doesn't make sense.\n\n10:48.480 --> 10:50.520\n That's when you really go to work.\n\n10:50.520 --> 10:52.920\n The rest of it's just processing.\n\n10:52.920 --> 10:55.320\n You know, on a quick tangent,\n\n10:55.320 --> 10:57.400\n pattern recognition is a term often used\n\n10:57.400 --> 10:58.960\n throughout the history of AI.\n\n10:58.960 --> 11:01.480\n That's the goal of artificial intelligence\n\n11:01.480 --> 11:03.400\n is pattern recognition, right?\n\n11:03.400 --> 11:08.400\n But there's, I would say, various flavors of that.\n\n11:08.400 --> 11:12.600\n So usually pattern recognition refers to the process\n\n11:12.600 --> 11:17.200\n of the, we said dress and the lint on the dress.\n\n11:17.200 --> 11:21.120\n Pattern recognition is very good at identifying the dress\n\n11:21.120 --> 11:24.880\n as looking at the pattern that's always there,\n\n11:24.880 --> 11:27.000\n that's very common and so on.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.920\n You almost refer to a pattern that's like\n\n11:28.920 --> 11:33.840\n in what's called outlier detection in computer science,\n\n11:33.840 --> 11:38.200\n right, the rare thing, the small thing.\n\n11:38.200 --> 11:41.800\n Now, AI is not often good at that.\n\n11:41.800 --> 11:46.240\n Do you, just almost philosophically,\n\n11:46.240 --> 11:48.880\n the kind of decisions you made in your life\n\n11:48.880 --> 11:52.040\n based scientifically almost on data,\n\n11:52.040 --> 11:55.000\n do you think AI in the future will be able to do?\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:59.400\n Is it something that could be put down into code\n\n11:59.400 --> 12:01.440\n or is it still deeply human?\n\n12:01.440 --> 12:07.440\n It's tough for me to say since I don't have domain knowledge\n\n12:09.040 --> 12:14.040\n in AI to know everything that could or might occur.\n\n12:14.960 --> 12:19.720\n I know, sort of in my own case,\n\n12:19.720 --> 12:22.840\n that most people don't see any of that.\n\n12:22.840 --> 12:27.840\n I just assumed it was motivational, you know,\n\n12:27.840 --> 12:32.920\n but it's also sort of, it's hardwiring.\n\n12:32.920 --> 12:38.560\n What are you wired or programmed to be finding or looking for?\n\n12:38.560 --> 12:41.960\n It's not what happens every day.\n\n12:41.960 --> 12:44.640\n That's not interesting, frankly.\n\n12:44.640 --> 12:47.080\n I mean, that's what people mostly do.\n\n12:47.080 --> 12:49.960\n I do a bunch of that too because, you know,\n\n12:49.960 --> 12:52.520\n that's what you do in normal life.\n\n12:52.520 --> 12:57.080\n But I've always been completely fascinated\n\n12:57.080 --> 13:00.200\n by the stuff that doesn't fit.\n\n13:00.200 --> 13:02.800\n Or the other way of thinking about it,\n\n13:02.800 --> 13:07.400\n it's determining what people want\n\n13:07.400 --> 13:10.040\n without them saying it.\n\n13:11.520 --> 13:14.520\n That's a different kind of pattern.\n\n13:14.520 --> 13:17.160\n You can see everything they're doing.\n\n13:17.160 --> 13:18.360\n There's a missing piece.\n\n13:18.360 --> 13:20.360\n They don't know it's missing.\n\n13:20.360 --> 13:23.400\n You think it's missing given the other facts.\n\n13:23.400 --> 13:27.080\n You know about them and you deliver that\n\n13:27.080 --> 13:28.840\n and then that becomes, you know,\n\n13:28.840 --> 13:33.320\n sort of very easy to sell to them.\n\n13:33.320 --> 13:35.280\n To linger on this point a little bit,\n\n13:35.280 --> 13:37.760\n you've mentioned that in your family,\n\n13:37.760 --> 13:38.680\n when you were growing up,\n\n13:38.680 --> 13:41.680\n nobody raised their voice in anger or otherwise.\n\n13:41.680 --> 13:44.240\n And you said that this allows you to learn to listen\n\n13:44.240 --> 13:46.040\n and hear some interesting things.\n\n13:47.360 --> 13:50.560\n Can you elaborate as you have been on that idea,\n\n13:50.560 --> 13:54.240\n what do you hear about the world if you listen?\n\n13:54.240 --> 13:57.400\n Well, you have to listen really intensely\n\n13:57.400 --> 14:01.120\n to understand what people are saying\n\n14:01.120 --> 14:03.560\n as well as what people are intending\n\n14:03.560 --> 14:06.720\n because it's not necessarily the same thing.\n\n14:07.800 --> 14:12.800\n And people mostly give themselves away\n\n14:14.120 --> 14:16.600\n no matter how clever they think they are.\n\n14:16.600 --> 14:21.600\n Particularly if you have the full array of inputs.\n\n14:22.440 --> 14:24.600\n In other words, if you look at their face,\n\n14:24.600 --> 14:28.200\n you look at their eyes, which are the window on the soul,\n\n14:28.200 --> 14:33.200\n it's very difficult to conceal what you're thinking.\n\n14:33.640 --> 14:36.560\n You look at facial expressions and posture.\n\n14:36.560 --> 14:39.480\n You listen to their voice, which changes.\n\n14:41.120 --> 14:44.880\n You know, when you're talking about something\n\n14:44.880 --> 14:46.800\n you're comfortable with or not,\n\n14:46.800 --> 14:48.720\n are you speaking faster?\n\n14:48.720 --> 14:51.880\n Is the amplitude of what you're saying higher?\n\n14:51.880 --> 14:56.200\n Most people just give away what's really on their mind.\n\n14:56.200 --> 14:58.600\n You know, they're not that clever.\n\n14:58.600 --> 15:00.600\n They're busy spending their time thinking about\n\n15:00.600 --> 15:03.520\n what they're in the process of saying.\n\n15:03.520 --> 15:07.960\n And so if you just observe that, not in a hostile way,\n\n15:07.960 --> 15:10.360\n but just in an evocative way\n\n15:10.360 --> 15:12.960\n and just let them talk for a while,\n\n15:12.960 --> 15:16.080\n they'll more or less tell you almost completely\n\n15:16.080 --> 15:17.800\n what they're thinking,\n\n15:17.800 --> 15:21.680\n even the stuff they don't want you to know.\n\n15:21.680 --> 15:24.720\n And once you know that, of course,\n\n15:24.720 --> 15:29.200\n it's sort of easy to play that kind of game\n\n15:29.200 --> 15:31.160\n because they've already told you\n\n15:31.160 --> 15:32.480\n everything you need to know.\n\n15:32.480 --> 15:37.080\n And so it's easy to get to a conclusion\n\n15:37.080 --> 15:40.520\n if there's meant to be one, an area of common interest,\n\n15:40.520 --> 15:44.800\n since you know almost exactly what's on their mind.\n\n15:44.800 --> 15:48.040\n And so that's an enormous advantage\n\n15:48.040 --> 15:51.840\n as opposed to just walking in someplace\n\n15:51.840 --> 15:54.000\n and somebody telling you something\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.400\n and you believing what they're saying.\n\n15:56.400 --> 15:59.880\n There are so many different levels of communication.\n\n16:01.120 --> 16:05.080\n So a powerful approach to life you discuss in the book\n\n16:05.080 --> 16:08.000\n on the topic of listening and really hearing people\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.240\n is figuring out what the biggest problem,\n\n16:10.240 --> 16:12.960\n bothering a particular individual or group is\n\n16:12.960 --> 16:15.560\n and coming up with a solution to that problem\n\n16:15.560 --> 16:18.720\n and presenting them with a solution, right?\n\n16:20.080 --> 16:24.280\n In fact, you brilliantly describe a lot of simple things\n\n16:24.280 --> 16:26.520\n that most people just don't do.\n\n16:26.520 --> 16:28.040\n It's kind of obvious,\n\n16:28.040 --> 16:31.240\n find the problem that's bothering somebody deeply.\n\n16:31.240 --> 16:33.560\n And as you said, I think you've implied\n\n16:33.560 --> 16:36.320\n that they will usually tell you what the problem is,\n\n16:36.320 --> 16:39.320\n but can you talk about this process\n\n16:39.320 --> 16:43.120\n of seeing what the biggest problem for a person is,\n\n16:43.120 --> 16:44.360\n trying to solve it,\n\n16:44.360 --> 16:47.760\n and maybe a particularly memorable example?\n\n16:47.760 --> 16:52.060\n Sure, if you know you're gonna meet somebody,\n\n16:52.060 --> 16:55.840\n there are two types of situations, chance meetings,\n\n16:55.840 --> 16:59.320\n and the second is you know you're gonna meet somebody.\n\n16:59.320 --> 17:01.320\n So let's take the easiest one,\n\n17:01.320 --> 17:04.160\n which is you know you're gonna meet somebody.\n\n17:04.160 --> 17:09.160\n And you start trying to make pretend you're them.\n\n17:09.640 --> 17:11.200\n It's really easy.\n\n17:11.200 --> 17:12.740\n What's on their mind?\n\n17:13.880 --> 17:16.280\n What are they thinking about in their daily life?\n\n17:16.280 --> 17:19.040\n What are the big problems they're facing?\n\n17:19.040 --> 17:24.040\n So if they're, you know, to make it a really easy example,\n\n17:24.540 --> 17:26.280\n you know, make pretend, you know,\n\n17:26.280 --> 17:28.760\n they're like president of the United States.\n\n17:28.760 --> 17:31.720\n Doesn't have to be this president, could be any president.\n\n17:31.720 --> 17:34.440\n So you sort of know what's more or less on their mind\n\n17:34.440 --> 17:37.260\n because the press keeps reporting it.\n\n17:37.260 --> 17:40.960\n And you see it on television, you hear it.\n\n17:40.960 --> 17:42.440\n People discuss it.\n\n17:42.440 --> 17:45.160\n So you know if you're gonna be running into somebody\n\n17:45.160 --> 17:47.400\n in that kind of position.\n\n17:47.400 --> 17:49.760\n You sort of know what they look like already.\n\n17:50.760 --> 17:52.120\n You know what they sound like.\n\n17:52.120 --> 17:56.000\n You know what their voice is like.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.360\n And you know what they're focused on.\n\n17:58.360 --> 18:01.440\n And so if you're gonna meet somebody like that,\n\n18:01.440 --> 18:05.360\n what you should do is take the biggest unresolved issue\n\n18:05.360 --> 18:09.120\n that they're facing and come up with\n\n18:09.120 --> 18:11.680\n a few interesting solutions\n\n18:11.680 --> 18:15.080\n that basically haven't been out there.\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:19.140\n Or that you haven't heard anybody else\n\n18:19.140 --> 18:20.000\n always thinking about.\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.680\n So just to give you an example,\n\n18:21.680 --> 18:24.360\n I was sort of in the early 1990s\n\n18:24.360 --> 18:26.420\n and I was invited to something at the White House\n\n18:26.420 --> 18:29.400\n which was a big deal for me because I was like,\n\n18:29.400 --> 18:30.940\n you know, a person from no place.\n\n18:30.940 --> 18:35.320\n And you know, I had met the president once before\n\n18:35.320 --> 18:37.200\n because it was President Bush\n\n18:37.200 --> 18:40.360\n because his son was in my dormitory.\n\n18:40.360 --> 18:43.000\n So I had met him at Parents Day.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.360\n I mean it's just like the oddity of things.\n\n18:45.360 --> 18:47.760\n So I knew I was gonna see him\n\n18:47.760 --> 18:50.400\n because that's where the invitation came from.\n\n18:51.560 --> 18:54.040\n And so there was something going on\n\n18:54.040 --> 18:57.320\n and I just thought about two or three ways\n\n18:57.320 --> 19:00.960\n to approach that issue.\n\n19:00.960 --> 19:04.400\n And you know, at that point I was separated\n\n19:04.400 --> 19:08.720\n and so I had brought a date to the White House\n\n19:08.720 --> 19:12.440\n and so I saw the president\n\n19:12.440 --> 19:16.040\n and we sort of went over in a corner for about 10 minutes\n\n19:16.040 --> 19:18.480\n and discussed whatever this issue was.\n\n19:18.480 --> 19:22.000\n And I later went back to my date.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:22.840\n It was a little rude\n\n19:22.840 --> 19:25.800\n but it was meant to be confidential conversation\n\n19:25.800 --> 19:27.720\n and I barely knew her.\n\n19:27.720 --> 19:29.560\n And you know, she said,\n\n19:29.560 --> 19:31.520\n what were you talking about all that time?\n\n19:31.520 --> 19:33.440\n I said, well, you know,\n\n19:33.440 --> 19:35.160\n there's something going on in the world\n\n19:35.160 --> 19:37.960\n and I've thought about different ways\n\n19:37.960 --> 19:40.800\n of perhaps approaching that and he was interested.\n\n19:41.640 --> 19:44.080\n And the answer is of course he was interested.\n\n19:44.080 --> 19:45.380\n Why wouldn't he be interested?\n\n19:45.380 --> 19:47.840\n There didn't seem to be an easy outcome.\n\n19:47.840 --> 19:51.360\n And so, you know, conversations of that type,\n\n19:51.360 --> 19:53.800\n once somebody knows you're really thinking\n\n19:53.800 --> 19:58.600\n about what's good for them and good for the situation,\n\n19:58.600 --> 20:01.880\n it has nothing to do with me.\n\n20:01.880 --> 20:05.480\n I mean, it's really about being in service,\n\n20:05.480 --> 20:08.640\n you know, to the situation.\n\n20:08.640 --> 20:12.080\n Then people trust you and they'll tell you other things\n\n20:12.080 --> 20:17.080\n because they know your motives are basically very pure.\n\n20:17.360 --> 20:20.560\n You're just trying to resolve a difficult situation\n\n20:20.560 --> 20:21.920\n or help somebody do it.\n\n20:21.920 --> 20:24.960\n So these types of things, you know,\n\n20:24.960 --> 20:27.600\n that's a planned situation, that's easy.\n\n20:27.600 --> 20:29.720\n Sometimes you just come upon somebody\n\n20:29.720 --> 20:31.980\n and they start talking and you know,\n\n20:31.980 --> 20:34.940\n that requires, you know, like different skills.\n\n20:34.940 --> 20:38.020\n You know, you can ask them,\n\n20:38.020 --> 20:39.440\n what have you been working on lately?\n\n20:39.440 --> 20:41.480\n What are you thinking about?\n\n20:41.480 --> 20:43.320\n You can ask them, you know,\n\n20:43.320 --> 20:45.720\n has anything been particularly difficult?\n\n20:45.720 --> 20:48.960\n And you know, you can ask most people\n\n20:48.960 --> 20:53.960\n if they trust you for some reason, they'll tell you.\n\n20:55.560 --> 20:58.000\n And then you have to instantly go to work on it.\n\n20:58.860 --> 21:02.120\n And you know, that's not as good\n\n21:02.120 --> 21:03.640\n as having some advanced planning,\n\n21:03.640 --> 21:08.640\n but you know, almost everything going on is like out there.\n\n21:10.880 --> 21:15.340\n And people who are involved with interesting situations,\n\n21:15.340 --> 21:20.340\n they're playing in the same ecosystem.\n\n21:20.980 --> 21:25.540\n They just have different roles in the ecosystem.\n\n21:25.540 --> 21:29.080\n And you know, you could do that\n\n21:29.080 --> 21:31.140\n with somebody who owns a pro football team\n\n21:32.100 --> 21:34.240\n that loses all the time.\n\n21:34.240 --> 21:37.300\n We specialize in those in New York.\n\n21:37.300 --> 21:41.460\n And you know, you already have analyzed\n\n21:41.460 --> 21:43.280\n why they're losing, right?\n\n21:43.280 --> 21:48.240\n Inevitably, it's because they don't have a great quarterback,\n\n21:48.240 --> 21:50.340\n they don't have a great coach,\n\n21:50.340 --> 21:52.420\n and they don't have a great general manager\n\n21:52.420 --> 21:55.180\n who knows how to hire the best talent.\n\n21:55.180 --> 21:59.200\n Those are the three reasons why a team fails, right?\n\n21:59.200 --> 22:01.160\n Because there are salary caps,\n\n22:01.160 --> 22:03.380\n so every team pays a certain amount of money\n\n22:03.380 --> 22:04.840\n for all their players.\n\n22:04.840 --> 22:07.000\n So it's gotta be those three positions.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.500\n So if you're talking with somebody like that,\n\n22:09.500 --> 22:13.460\n inevitably, even though it's not structured,\n\n22:13.460 --> 22:16.780\n you'll know how their team's doing\n\n22:16.780 --> 22:19.240\n and you'll know pretty much why.\n\n22:19.240 --> 22:22.420\n And if you start asking questions about that,\n\n22:22.420 --> 22:24.940\n they're typically very happy to talk about it\n\n22:24.940 --> 22:27.020\n because they haven't solved that problem.\n\n22:27.020 --> 22:29.620\n In some cases, they don't even know that's the problem.\n\n22:29.620 --> 22:31.300\n It's pretty easy to see it.\n\n22:31.300 --> 22:33.620\n So, you know, I do stuff like that,\n\n22:33.620 --> 22:38.620\n which I find is intuitive as a process,\n\n22:38.620 --> 22:43.540\n but, you know, leads to really good results.\n\n22:43.540 --> 22:46.680\n Well, the funny thing is when you're smart,\n\n22:48.220 --> 22:51.400\n for smart people, it's hard to escape their own ego\n\n22:51.400 --> 22:53.520\n and the space of their own problems,\n\n22:53.520 --> 22:55.680\n which is what's required\n\n22:55.680 --> 22:58.220\n to think about other people's problems.\n\n22:58.220 --> 23:01.040\n It requires for you to let go of the fact\n\n23:01.040 --> 23:03.780\n that your own problems are all important\n\n23:03.780 --> 23:05.700\n and then to talk about your,\n\n23:05.700 --> 23:09.240\n I think while it seems obvious\n\n23:09.240 --> 23:11.860\n and I think quite brilliant,\n\n23:11.860 --> 23:14.580\n it's just a difficult leap for many people,\n\n23:14.580 --> 23:16.340\n especially smart people,\n\n23:16.340 --> 23:19.380\n to empathize with, truly empathize with the problems\n\n23:19.380 --> 23:20.220\n of others.\n\n23:21.140 --> 23:23.380\n Well, I have a competitive advantage,\n\n23:23.380 --> 23:27.660\n which is, I don't think I'm so smart.\n\n23:29.220 --> 23:31.820\n So, you know, it's not a problem for me.\n\n23:31.820 --> 23:33.460\n Well, the truly smartest people I know\n\n23:33.460 --> 23:34.820\n say that exact same thing.\n\n23:34.820 --> 23:39.580\n Yeah, being humble is really useful,\n\n23:39.580 --> 23:41.480\n competitive advantage, as you said.\n\n23:42.520 --> 23:44.440\n How do you stay humble?\n\n23:44.440 --> 23:46.960\n Well, I haven't changed much.\n\n23:46.960 --> 23:47.800\n Since?\n\n23:47.800 --> 23:51.100\n Since I was in my mid teens.\n\n23:51.100 --> 23:54.800\n You know, I was raised partly in the city\n\n23:54.800 --> 23:56.340\n and partly in the suburbs.\n\n23:58.280 --> 24:03.280\n And, you know, whatever the values I had at that time,\n\n24:03.280 --> 24:05.700\n those are still my values.\n\n24:05.700 --> 24:08.300\n I call them like middle class values,\n\n24:08.300 --> 24:10.300\n that's how I was raised.\n\n24:10.300 --> 24:14.740\n And I've never changed, why would I?\n\n24:14.740 --> 24:16.300\n That's who I am.\n\n24:16.300 --> 24:21.140\n And so the accoutrement of, you know,\n\n24:21.140 --> 24:25.580\n the rest of your life has gotta be put on the same,\n\n24:25.580 --> 24:28.480\n you know, like solid foundation of who you are.\n\n24:28.480 --> 24:31.220\n Because if you start losing who you really are,\n\n24:31.220 --> 24:32.700\n who are you?\n\n24:32.700 --> 24:37.180\n So I've never had the desire to be somebody else.\n\n24:37.180 --> 24:40.740\n I just do other things now that I wouldn't do\n\n24:40.740 --> 24:43.940\n as a, you know, sort of as a middle class kid\n\n24:43.940 --> 24:45.340\n from Philadelphia.\n\n24:45.340 --> 24:48.660\n I mean, my life has morphed on a certain level.\n\n24:48.660 --> 24:52.580\n But part of the strength of having integrity\n\n24:52.580 --> 24:57.580\n of personality is that you can remain in touch\n\n24:57.580 --> 25:02.580\n with everybody who comes from that kind of background.\n\n25:04.160 --> 25:07.320\n And, you know, even though I do some things\n\n25:07.320 --> 25:09.000\n that aren't like that, you know,\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:12.340\n in terms of people I meet or situations I'm in,\n\n25:12.340 --> 25:15.040\n I always look at it through the same lens.\n\n25:15.040 --> 25:17.800\n And that's very psychologically comfortable\n\n25:18.760 --> 25:22.500\n and doesn't require me to make any real adjustments\n\n25:22.500 --> 25:25.200\n in my life and I just keep plowing ahead.\n\n25:25.200 --> 25:29.500\n There's a lot of activity in progress in recent years\n\n25:29.500 --> 25:31.300\n around effective altruism.\n\n25:32.620 --> 25:34.500\n I wanted to bring this topic with you\n\n25:34.500 --> 25:37.100\n because it's an interesting one from your perspective.\n\n25:38.220 --> 25:39.980\n You can put it in any kind of terms,\n\n25:39.980 --> 25:44.300\n but it's philanthropy that focuses on maximizing impact.\n\n25:44.300 --> 25:47.340\n How do you see the goal of philanthropy,\n\n25:47.340 --> 25:50.020\n both from a personal motivation perspective\n\n25:50.020 --> 25:53.580\n and the societal big picture impact perspective?\n\n25:53.580 --> 25:55.940\n Yeah, I don't think about philanthropy\n\n25:55.940 --> 25:58.980\n the way you would expect me to, okay?\n\n25:58.980 --> 26:03.980\n I look at, you know, sort of solving big issues,\n\n26:04.420 --> 26:09.420\n addressing big issues, starting new organizations to do it,\n\n26:09.500 --> 26:12.060\n much like we do in our business.\n\n26:12.060 --> 26:14.300\n You know, we keep growing our business\n\n26:14.300 --> 26:17.620\n not by taking the original thing and making it larger,\n\n26:17.620 --> 26:22.260\n but continually seeing new things and building those.\n\n26:22.260 --> 26:26.380\n And, you know, sort of marshaling financial resources,\n\n26:26.380 --> 26:30.420\n human resources, and in our case,\n\n26:30.420 --> 26:32.120\n because we're in the investment business,\n\n26:32.120 --> 26:33.980\n we find something new that looks like\n\n26:33.980 --> 26:36.780\n it's gonna be terrific and we do that\n\n26:36.780 --> 26:38.740\n and it works out really well.\n\n26:38.740 --> 26:42.300\n All I do in what you would call philanthropy\n\n26:42.300 --> 26:47.300\n is look at other opportunities to help society.\n\n26:47.300 --> 26:50.380\n And I end up starting something new,\n\n26:50.380 --> 26:53.100\n marshaling people, marshaling a lot of money,\n\n26:53.100 --> 26:56.820\n and then at the end of that kind of creative process,\n\n26:56.820 --> 26:59.740\n somebody typically asks me to write a check.\n\n26:59.740 --> 27:01.940\n I don't wake up and say,\n\n27:01.940 --> 27:05.460\n how can I give large amounts of money away?\n\n27:05.460 --> 27:10.460\n I look at issues that are important for people.\n\n27:10.620 --> 27:13.700\n In some cases, I do smaller things.\n\n27:13.700 --> 27:18.700\n Because it's important to a person, and, you know,\n\n27:18.700 --> 27:21.060\n I can relate to that person.\n\n27:21.060 --> 27:24.540\n There's some unfairness that's happened to them.\n\n27:24.540 --> 27:26.940\n And so in situations like that,\n\n27:26.940 --> 27:29.820\n I'd give money anonymously and help them out.\n\n27:29.820 --> 27:34.820\n And, you know, it's like a miniature version\n\n27:35.460 --> 27:37.540\n of addressing something really big.\n\n27:37.540 --> 27:41.700\n So, you know, at MIT, I'm a little bit\n\n27:41.700 --> 27:46.660\n you know, at MIT, I've done a big thing,\n\n27:46.660 --> 27:49.860\n you know, helping to start this new school of computing.\n\n27:49.860 --> 27:51.940\n And I did that because, you know,\n\n27:51.940 --> 27:56.940\n I saw that, you know, there's sort of like a global race on\n\n27:57.220 --> 28:00.700\n in AI, quantum, and other major technologies.\n\n28:00.700 --> 28:05.700\n And I thought that the US could use more enhancement\n\n28:06.860 --> 28:09.700\n from a competitive perspective.\n\n28:09.700 --> 28:12.340\n And I also, because I get to China a lot\n\n28:12.340 --> 28:16.060\n and I travel around a lot compared to a regular person,\n\n28:17.140 --> 28:21.020\n you know, I can see the need to have control\n\n28:21.020 --> 28:23.140\n of these types of technologies.\n\n28:23.140 --> 28:26.340\n So when they're introduced, we don't create a mess\n\n28:26.340 --> 28:30.740\n like we did with the internet and with social media.\n\n28:30.740 --> 28:33.420\n Unintended consequence, you know,\n\n28:33.420 --> 28:36.540\n that's creating all kinds of issues and freedom of speech\n\n28:36.540 --> 28:39.380\n and the functioning of liberal democracies.\n\n28:39.380 --> 28:41.580\n So with AI, it was pretty clear\n\n28:41.580 --> 28:44.980\n that there was enormous difference of views\n\n28:44.980 --> 28:48.740\n around the world by the relatively few practitioners\n\n28:48.740 --> 28:51.500\n in the world who really knew what was going on.\n\n28:51.500 --> 28:55.900\n And by accident, I knew a bunch of these people,\n\n28:55.900 --> 28:59.940\n you know, who were like big famous people.\n\n28:59.940 --> 29:01.980\n And I could talk to them and say,\n\n29:01.980 --> 29:04.260\n why do you think this is a force for bad?\n\n29:05.140 --> 29:08.700\n And someone else, why do you feel this is a force for good?\n\n29:08.700 --> 29:13.500\n And how do we move forward with the technology\n\n29:13.500 --> 29:18.500\n by the same time, make sure that whatever is potentially,\n\n29:19.460 --> 29:22.380\n you know, sort of on the bad side of this technology\n\n29:22.380 --> 29:26.220\n with, you know, for example, disruption of workforces\n\n29:26.220 --> 29:29.700\n and things like that, that could happen much faster\n\n29:29.700 --> 29:32.100\n than the industrial revolution.\n\n29:32.100 --> 29:33.380\n What do we do about that?\n\n29:33.380 --> 29:35.980\n And how do we keep that under control\n\n29:35.980 --> 29:39.540\n so that the really good things about these technologies,\n\n29:39.540 --> 29:41.860\n which will be great things,\n\n29:41.860 --> 29:44.980\n not good things are allowed to happen?\n\n29:44.980 --> 29:49.980\n So to me, you know, this was one of the great issues\n\n29:52.100 --> 29:53.900\n facing society.\n\n29:53.900 --> 29:57.420\n The number of people who were aware of it were very small.\n\n29:57.420 --> 30:00.460\n I just accidentally got sucked into it.\n\n30:00.460 --> 30:06.420\n And as soon as I saw it, I went, oh my God, this is mega,\n\n30:06.420 --> 30:09.980\n both on a competitive basis globally,\n\n30:09.980 --> 30:13.620\n but also in terms of protecting society\n\n30:13.620 --> 30:15.540\n and benefiting society.\n\n30:15.540 --> 30:17.620\n So that's how I got involved.\n\n30:17.620 --> 30:20.140\n And at the end, you know, sort of the right thing\n\n30:20.140 --> 30:22.380\n that we figured out was, you know,\n\n30:22.380 --> 30:26.180\n sort of double MIT's computer science faculty\n\n30:26.180 --> 30:30.900\n and basically create the first AI enabled university\n\n30:30.900 --> 30:32.500\n in the world.\n\n30:32.500 --> 30:35.660\n And, you know, in effect, be an example,\n\n30:35.660 --> 30:38.460\n a beacon to the rest of the research community\n\n30:38.460 --> 30:40.900\n around the world academically,\n\n30:40.900 --> 30:49.300\n and create, you know, a much more robust U.S. situation,\n\n30:49.300 --> 30:52.940\n competitive situation among the universities.\n\n30:52.940 --> 30:55.820\n Because if MIT was going to raise a lot of money\n\n30:55.820 --> 30:59.340\n and double its faculty, well, you could bet that,\n\n30:59.340 --> 31:02.460\n you know, a number of other universities\n\n31:02.460 --> 31:03.420\n were going to do the same thing.\n\n31:03.420 --> 31:08.260\n At the end of it, it would be great for knowledge creation,\n\n31:08.260 --> 31:12.980\n you know, great for the United States, great for the world.\n\n31:12.980 --> 31:19.580\n And so I like to do things that I think are really positive,\n\n31:19.580 --> 31:23.060\n things that other people aren't acting on,\n\n31:23.060 --> 31:25.940\n that I see for whatever the reason.\n\n31:25.940 --> 31:29.220\n First, it's just people I meet and what they say,\n\n31:29.220 --> 31:32.940\n and I can recognize when something really profound\n\n31:32.940 --> 31:35.380\n is about to happen or needs to.\n\n31:35.380 --> 31:39.100\n And I do it, and at the end of the situation,\n\n31:39.100 --> 31:43.300\n somebody says, can you write a check to help us?\n\n31:43.300 --> 31:44.860\n And then the answer is sure.\n\n31:44.860 --> 31:48.260\n I mean, because if I don't, the vision won't happen.\n\n31:48.260 --> 31:52.420\n But it's the vision of whatever I do\n\n31:52.420 --> 31:54.380\n that is compelling.\n\n31:54.380 --> 31:59.540\n And essentially, I love that idea of whether it's small\n\n31:59.540 --> 32:01.940\n at the individual level or really big,\n\n32:01.940 --> 32:06.820\n like the gift to MIT to launch the College of Computing.\n\n32:06.820 --> 32:14.500\n It starts with a vision, and you see philanthropy as,\n\n32:14.500 --> 32:18.460\n the biggest impact you can have is by launching something new,\n\n32:18.460 --> 32:22.500\n especially on an issue that others aren't really addressing.\n\n32:22.500 --> 32:25.700\n And I also love the notion, and you're absolutely right,\n\n32:25.700 --> 32:30.580\n that there's other universities, Stanford, CMU,\n\n32:30.580 --> 32:33.460\n I'm looking at you, that would essentially,\n\n32:33.460 --> 32:39.500\n the seed will create other, it'll have a ripple effect\n\n32:39.500 --> 32:42.500\n that potentially might help US be a leader\n\n32:42.500 --> 32:44.300\n or continue to be a leader in AI.\n\n32:44.300 --> 32:49.060\n It's potentially a very transformative research\n\n32:49.060 --> 32:50.020\n direction.\n\n32:50.020 --> 32:52.220\n Just to linger on that point a little bit,\n\n32:52.220 --> 32:55.980\n what is your hope long term for the impact\n\n32:55.980 --> 33:00.260\n the college here at MIT might have in the next five, 10,\n\n33:00.260 --> 33:03.580\n even 20, or let's get crazy, 30, 50 years?\n\n33:03.580 --> 33:06.100\n Well, it's very difficult to predict the future\n\n33:06.100 --> 33:08.460\n when you're dealing with knowledge production\n\n33:08.460 --> 33:11.140\n and creativity.\n\n33:11.140 --> 33:16.220\n MIT has, obviously, some unique aspects.\n\n33:16.220 --> 33:22.780\n Globally, there's four big academic surveys.\n\n33:22.780 --> 33:25.460\n I forget whether it was QS, there's\n\n33:25.460 --> 33:31.100\n the Times in London, the US News, and whatever.\n\n33:31.100 --> 33:34.900\n And one of these recently, MIT, was ranked number one\n\n33:34.900 --> 33:37.620\n in the world.\n\n33:37.620 --> 33:41.420\n So leave aside whether you're number three somewhere else,\n\n33:41.420 --> 33:47.140\n in the great sweep of humanity, this is pretty amazing.\n\n33:47.140 --> 33:53.580\n So you have a really remarkable aggregation of human talent\n\n33:53.580 --> 33:55.180\n here.\n\n33:55.180 --> 33:58.380\n And where it goes, it's hard to tell.\n\n33:58.380 --> 34:03.220\n You have to be a scientist to have the right feel.\n\n34:03.220 --> 34:08.620\n But what's important is you have a critical mass of people.\n\n34:08.620 --> 34:12.620\n And I think it breaks into two buckets.\n\n34:12.620 --> 34:15.700\n One is scientific advancement.\n\n34:15.700 --> 34:21.500\n And if the new college can help either\n\n34:21.500 --> 34:25.780\n serve as a convening force within the university\n\n34:25.780 --> 34:33.020\n or help coordination and communication among people,\n\n34:33.020 --> 34:36.780\n that's a good thing, absolute good thing.\n\n34:36.780 --> 34:41.580\n The second thing is in the AI ethics area,\n\n34:41.580 --> 34:48.940\n which is, in a way, equally important.\n\n34:48.940 --> 34:55.620\n Because if the science side creates blowback\n\n34:55.620 --> 35:03.980\n so that science is a bit crippled in terms\n\n35:03.980 --> 35:09.020\n of going forward because society's reaction to knowledge\n\n35:09.020 --> 35:13.140\n advancement in this field becomes really hostile,\n\n35:13.140 --> 35:15.460\n then you've sort of lost the game\n\n35:15.460 --> 35:18.980\n in terms of scientific progress and innovation.\n\n35:18.980 --> 35:22.980\n And so the AI ethics piece is super important\n\n35:22.980 --> 35:29.500\n because in a perfect world, MIT would\n\n35:29.500 --> 35:32.460\n serve as a global convener.\n\n35:32.460 --> 35:38.420\n Because what you need is you need the research universities.\n\n35:38.420 --> 35:46.460\n You need the companies that are driving AI and quantum work.\n\n35:46.460 --> 35:49.500\n You need governments who will ultimately\n\n35:49.500 --> 35:53.460\n be regulating certain elements of this.\n\n35:53.460 --> 35:59.540\n And you also need the media to be knowledgeable and trained\n\n35:59.540 --> 36:09.020\n so we don't get overreactions to one situation, which then goes\n\n36:09.020 --> 36:12.540\n viral and it ends up shutting down\n\n36:12.540 --> 36:18.660\n avenues that are perfectly fine to be walking down or running\n\n36:18.660 --> 36:20.540\n down that avenue.\n\n36:20.540 --> 36:25.580\n But if enough discordant information,\n\n36:25.580 --> 36:34.020\n not even correct necessarily, sort of gets\n\n36:34.020 --> 36:36.900\n pushed around society, then you can end up\n\n36:36.900 --> 36:40.700\n with a really hostile regulatory environment and other things.\n\n36:40.700 --> 36:44.540\n So you have four drivers that have\n\n36:44.540 --> 36:50.220\n to be sort of integrated.\n\n36:50.220 --> 36:55.100\n And so if the new school of computing\n\n36:55.100 --> 36:58.540\n can be really helpful in that regard,\n\n36:58.540 --> 37:02.100\n then that's a real service to science.\n\n37:02.100 --> 37:05.100\n And it's a service to MIT.\n\n37:05.100 --> 37:10.060\n So that's why I wanted to get involved for both areas.\n\n37:10.060 --> 37:12.820\n And the hope is for me, for others,\n\n37:12.820 --> 37:17.620\n for everyone, for the world, is for this particular college\n\n37:17.620 --> 37:22.980\n of computing to be a beacon and a connector for these ideas.\n\n37:22.980 --> 37:23.820\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n37:23.820 --> 37:31.940\n I mean, I think MIT is perfectly positioned to do that.\n\n37:31.940 --> 37:35.220\n So you've mentioned the media, social media, the internet\n\n37:35.220 --> 37:41.900\n as this complex network of communication with flaws,\n\n37:41.900 --> 37:44.140\n perhaps, perhaps you can speak to them.\n\n37:44.140 --> 37:50.500\n But I personally think that science and technology\n\n37:50.500 --> 37:58.140\n has its flaws, but ultimately is, one, sexy, exciting.\n\n37:58.140 --> 38:01.180\n It's the way for us to explore and understand\n\n38:01.180 --> 38:02.940\n the mysteries of our world.\n\n38:02.940 --> 38:06.900\n And two, perhaps more importantly for some people,\n\n38:06.900 --> 38:09.700\n it's a huge way to, a really powerful way\n\n38:09.700 --> 38:12.540\n to grow the economy, to improve the quality of life\n\n38:12.540 --> 38:13.620\n for everyone.\n\n38:13.620 --> 38:19.060\n So how do we get, how do you see the media, social media,\n\n38:19.060 --> 38:26.060\n the internet as a society having a healthy discourse\n\n38:26.060 --> 38:30.220\n about science, first of all, one that's factual\n\n38:30.220 --> 38:33.140\n and two, one that finds science exciting,\n\n38:33.140 --> 38:36.540\n that invests in science, that pushes it forward,\n\n38:36.540 --> 38:41.620\n especially in this science fiction, fear filled field\n\n38:41.620 --> 38:43.460\n of artificial intelligence?\n\n38:43.460 --> 38:45.780\n Well, I think that's a little above my pay grade\n\n38:45.780 --> 38:50.060\n because trying to control social media\n\n38:50.060 --> 38:52.820\n to make it do what you want to do\n\n38:52.820 --> 38:56.580\n appears to be beyond almost anybody's control.\n\n38:56.580 --> 39:00.820\n And the technology is being used to create\n\n39:00.820 --> 39:04.060\n what I call the tyranny of the minorities.\n\n39:04.060 --> 39:07.940\n A minority is defined as two or three people\n\n39:07.940 --> 39:09.300\n on a street corner.\n\n39:09.300 --> 39:11.340\n Doesn't matter what they look like.\n\n39:11.340 --> 39:13.500\n Doesn't matter where they came from.\n\n39:13.500 --> 39:19.940\n They're united by that one issue that they care about.\n\n39:19.940 --> 39:26.860\n And their job is to enforce their views on the world.\n\n39:26.860 --> 39:30.860\n And in the political world, people just\n\n39:30.860 --> 39:34.100\n are manufacturing truth.\n\n39:34.100 --> 39:36.340\n And they throw it all over.\n\n39:36.340 --> 39:38.980\n And it affects all of us.\n\n39:38.980 --> 39:45.220\n And sometimes people are just hired to do that.\n\n39:45.220 --> 39:46.780\n It's amazing.\n\n39:46.780 --> 39:48.740\n And you think it's one person.\n\n39:48.740 --> 39:55.340\n It's really just sort of a front for a particular point of view.\n\n39:55.340 --> 39:59.860\n And this has become exceptionally disruptive\n\n39:59.860 --> 40:01.860\n for society.\n\n40:01.860 --> 40:03.500\n And it's dangerous.\n\n40:03.500 --> 40:07.420\n And it's undercutting the ability of liberal democracies\n\n40:07.420 --> 40:09.020\n to function.\n\n40:09.020 --> 40:11.980\n And I don't know how to get a grip on this.\n\n40:11.980 --> 40:16.260\n And I was really surprised when we was up here\n\n40:16.260 --> 40:24.500\n for the announcement last spring of the College of Computing.\n\n40:24.500 --> 40:27.580\n And they had all these famous scientists, some of whom\n\n40:27.580 --> 40:32.660\n were involved with the invention of the internet.\n\n40:32.660 --> 40:36.460\n And almost every one of them got up and said,\n\n40:36.460 --> 40:39.180\n I think I made a mistake.\n\n40:39.180 --> 40:41.500\n And as a non scientist, I never thought\n\n40:41.500 --> 40:44.100\n I'd hear anyone say that.\n\n40:44.100 --> 40:48.660\n And what they said is, more or less, to make it simple,\n\n40:48.660 --> 40:52.660\n we thought this would be really cool inventing the internet.\n\n40:52.660 --> 40:55.020\n We could connect everyone in the world.\n\n40:55.020 --> 40:56.820\n We can move knowledge around.\n\n40:56.820 --> 40:58.980\n It was instantaneous.\n\n40:58.980 --> 41:01.260\n It's a really amazing thing.\n\n41:01.260 --> 41:04.380\n He said, I don't know that there was anyone\n\n41:04.380 --> 41:07.540\n who ever thought about social media coming out of that\n\n41:07.540 --> 41:12.580\n and the actual consequences for people's lives.\n\n41:12.580 --> 41:17.580\n There's always some younger person.\n\n41:17.580 --> 41:19.700\n I just saw one of these yesterday.\n\n41:19.700 --> 41:21.380\n It's reported on the national news\n\n41:21.380 --> 41:25.740\n who killed himself when people use social media\n\n41:25.740 --> 41:30.500\n to basically sort of ridicule him or something of that type.\n\n41:30.500 --> 41:33.460\n This is dead.\n\n41:33.460 --> 41:35.780\n This is dangerous.\n\n41:35.780 --> 41:43.660\n And so I don't have a solution for that other\n\n41:43.660 --> 41:46.940\n than going forward, you can end up\n\n41:46.940 --> 41:50.060\n with this type of outcome using AI.\n\n41:50.060 --> 41:56.180\n To make this kind of mistake twice is unforgivable.\n\n41:56.180 --> 42:02.180\n So interestingly, at least in the West and parts of China,\n\n42:02.180 --> 42:08.900\n people are quite sympathetic to the whole concept of AI ethics\n\n42:08.900 --> 42:13.620\n and what gets introduced when and cooperation\n\n42:13.620 --> 42:17.460\n within your own country, within your own industry,\n\n42:17.460 --> 42:20.420\n as well as globally to make sure\n\n42:20.420 --> 42:24.260\n that the technology is a force for good.\n\n42:24.260 --> 42:25.660\n And that really interesting topic.\n\n42:25.660 --> 42:28.660\n Since 2007, you've had a relationship\n\n42:28.660 --> 42:32.820\n with senior leadership with a lot of people in China\n\n42:32.820 --> 42:36.020\n and an interest in understanding modern China,\n\n42:36.020 --> 42:39.540\n their culture, their world, much like with Russia.\n\n42:39.540 --> 42:42.180\n I'm from Russia originally.\n\n42:42.180 --> 42:44.980\n Americans are told a very narrow, one sided story\n\n42:44.980 --> 42:48.660\n about China that I'm sure misses a lot\n\n42:48.660 --> 42:53.260\n of fascinating complexity, both positive and negative.\n\n42:53.260 --> 42:57.020\n What lessons about Chinese culture, its ideas as a nation,\n\n42:57.020 --> 43:00.540\n its future do you think Americans should know about,\n\n43:00.540 --> 43:02.860\n deliberate on, think about?\n\n43:02.860 --> 43:06.100\n Well, it's sort of a wide question\n\n43:06.100 --> 43:09.500\n that you're asking about.\n\n43:09.500 --> 43:11.860\n China is a pretty unusual place.\n\n43:11.860 --> 43:15.940\n First, it's huge.\n\n43:15.940 --> 43:17.660\n It's physically huge.\n\n43:17.660 --> 43:19.980\n It's got a billion three people.\n\n43:19.980 --> 43:24.940\n And the character of the people isn't as well understood\n\n43:24.940 --> 43:27.300\n in the United States.\n\n43:27.300 --> 43:34.020\n Chinese people are amazingly energetic.\n\n43:34.020 --> 43:37.220\n If you're one of a billion three people,\n\n43:37.220 --> 43:40.100\n one of the things you've got to be focused on\n\n43:40.100 --> 43:44.900\n is how do you make your way through a crowd\n\n43:44.900 --> 43:50.940\n of a billion 2.99999 other people.\n\n43:50.940 --> 43:52.900\n No, the word for that is competitive.\n\n43:52.900 --> 43:57.100\n Yes, they are individually highly energetic,\n\n43:57.100 --> 44:02.900\n highly focused, always looking for some opportunity\n\n44:02.900 --> 44:07.740\n for themselves because they need to,\n\n44:07.740 --> 44:11.940\n because there's an enormous amount of just literally people\n\n44:11.940 --> 44:12.460\n around.\n\n44:12.460 --> 44:17.860\n And so what I've found is they'll\n\n44:17.860 --> 44:21.780\n try and find a way to win for themselves.\n\n44:21.780 --> 44:25.900\n And their country is complicated because it basically\n\n44:25.900 --> 44:29.540\n doesn't have the same kind of functional laws\n\n44:29.540 --> 44:34.020\n that we do in the United States and the West.\n\n44:34.020 --> 44:39.740\n And the country is controlled really\n\n44:39.740 --> 44:44.340\n through a web of relationships you have with other people\n\n44:44.340 --> 44:47.500\n and the relationships that those other people have\n\n44:47.500 --> 44:48.860\n with other people.\n\n44:48.860 --> 44:53.860\n So it's an incredibly dynamic culture\n\n44:53.860 --> 44:56.860\n where if somebody knocks somebody up\n\n44:56.860 --> 44:59.620\n on the top who's three levels above you\n\n44:59.620 --> 45:01.300\n and is, in effect, protecting you,\n\n45:01.300 --> 45:08.260\n then you're like a floating molecule there\n\n45:08.260 --> 45:12.140\n without tethering except the one or two layers above you.\n\n45:12.140 --> 45:14.180\n But that's going to get affected.\n\n45:14.180 --> 45:15.940\n So it's a very dynamic system.\n\n45:15.940 --> 45:19.940\n And getting people to change is not that easy\n\n45:19.940 --> 45:23.780\n because if there aren't really functioning laws,\n\n45:23.780 --> 45:27.380\n it's only the relationships that everybody has.\n\n45:27.380 --> 45:30.900\n And so when you decide to make a major change\n\n45:30.900 --> 45:33.980\n and you sign up for it, something\n\n45:33.980 --> 45:36.420\n is changing in your life.\n\n45:36.420 --> 45:40.700\n There won't necessarily be all the same people on your team.\n\n45:40.700 --> 45:43.660\n And that's a very high risk enterprise.\n\n45:43.660 --> 45:46.260\n So when you're dealing with China,\n\n45:46.260 --> 45:50.940\n it's important to know almost what everybody's relationship\n\n45:50.940 --> 45:52.740\n is with somebody.\n\n45:52.740 --> 45:55.860\n So when you suggest doing something differently,\n\n45:55.860 --> 45:59.100\n you line up these forces.\n\n45:59.100 --> 46:02.740\n In the West, it's usually you talk to a person\n\n46:02.740 --> 46:04.900\n and they figure out what's good for them.\n\n46:04.900 --> 46:06.340\n It's a lot easier.\n\n46:06.340 --> 46:08.820\n And in that sense, in a funny way,\n\n46:08.820 --> 46:11.420\n it's easier to make change in the West,\n\n46:11.420 --> 46:14.860\n just the opposite of what people think.\n\n46:14.860 --> 46:17.220\n But once the Chinese system adjusts\n\n46:17.220 --> 46:22.500\n to something that's new, everybody's on the team.\n\n46:22.500 --> 46:23.540\n It's hard to change them.\n\n46:23.540 --> 46:28.740\n But once they're changed, they are incredibly focused in a way\n\n46:28.740 --> 46:31.860\n that it's hard for the West to do\n\n46:31.860 --> 46:35.020\n in a more individualistic culture.\n\n46:35.020 --> 46:38.700\n So there are all kinds of fascinating things.\n\n46:42.580 --> 46:46.820\n One thing that might interest the people who are listening\n\n46:46.820 --> 46:50.900\n who are more technologically based than some other group.\n\n46:50.900 --> 46:56.060\n I was with one of the top people in the government\n\n46:56.060 --> 47:00.060\n a few weeks ago, and he was telling me that every school\n\n47:00.060 --> 47:08.700\n child in China is going to be taught computer science.\n\n47:08.700 --> 47:14.980\n Now, imagine 100% of these children.\n\n47:14.980 --> 47:20.060\n This is such a large number of human beings.\n\n47:20.060 --> 47:22.820\n Now, that doesn't mean that every one of them\n\n47:22.820 --> 47:25.260\n will be good at computer science.\n\n47:25.260 --> 47:28.780\n But if it's sort of like in the West,\n\n47:28.780 --> 47:33.420\n if it's like math or English, everybody's going to take it.\n\n47:33.420 --> 47:35.540\n Not everybody's great at English.\n\n47:35.540 --> 47:36.540\n They don't write books.\n\n47:36.540 --> 47:38.220\n They don't write poetry.\n\n47:38.220 --> 47:41.180\n And not everybody's good at math.\n\n47:41.180 --> 47:44.780\n Somebody like myself, I sort of evolved to the third grade,\n\n47:44.780 --> 47:47.740\n and I'm still doing flashcards.\n\n47:47.740 --> 47:50.220\n I didn't make it further in math.\n\n47:50.220 --> 47:54.660\n But imagine everybody in their society\n\n47:54.660 --> 47:58.380\n is going to be involved with computer science.\n\n47:58.380 --> 48:01.180\n I'd just even pause on that.\n\n48:01.180 --> 48:05.180\n I think computer science involves,\n\n48:05.180 --> 48:07.940\n at the basic beginner level, programming.\n\n48:07.940 --> 48:11.380\n And the idea that everybody in the society\n\n48:11.380 --> 48:18.620\n would have some ability to program a computer is incredible.\n\n48:18.620 --> 48:20.340\n For me, it's incredibly exciting,\n\n48:20.340 --> 48:24.980\n and I think that should give the United States pause\n\n48:24.980 --> 48:28.100\n and consider what...\n\n48:28.100 --> 48:31.300\n Talking about sort of philanthropy and launching things,\n\n48:31.300 --> 48:33.780\n there's nothing like launching,\n\n48:33.780 --> 48:38.180\n sort of investing in young youth, the education system,\n\n48:38.180 --> 48:40.380\n because that's where everything launches.\n\n48:40.380 --> 48:41.220\n Yes.\n\n48:41.220 --> 48:42.620\n Well, we've got a complicated system\n\n48:42.620 --> 48:45.700\n because we have over 3,000 school districts\n\n48:45.700 --> 48:47.380\n around the country.\n\n48:47.380 --> 48:50.900\n China doesn't worry about that as a concept.\n\n48:50.900 --> 48:55.220\n They make a decision at the very top of the government\n\n48:55.220 --> 48:57.380\n that that's what they want to have happen,\n\n48:57.380 --> 48:59.460\n and that is what will happen.\n\n48:59.460 --> 49:07.020\n And we're really handicapped by this distributed power\n\n49:07.020 --> 49:08.180\n in the education area,\n\n49:08.180 --> 49:10.820\n although some people involved with that area\n\n49:10.820 --> 49:13.860\n will think it's great.\n\n49:13.860 --> 49:17.060\n But you would know better than I do\n\n49:17.060 --> 49:18.900\n what percent of American children\n\n49:18.900 --> 49:23.220\n have computer science exposure.\n\n49:23.220 --> 49:29.460\n My guess, no knowledge, would be 5% or less.\n\n49:29.460 --> 49:33.060\n And if we're going to be going into a world\n\n49:33.060 --> 49:37.380\n where the other major economic power,\n\n49:37.380 --> 49:42.580\n sort of like ourselves, has got like 100% and we got 5%,\n\n49:42.580 --> 49:49.060\n and the whole computer science area is the future,\n\n49:49.060 --> 49:52.980\n then we're purposely or accidentally actually\n\n49:52.980 --> 49:54.900\n handicapping ourselves,\n\n49:54.900 --> 50:00.300\n and our system doesn't allow us to adjust quickly to that.\n\n50:00.300 --> 50:06.300\n So, you know, issues like this I find fascinating.\n\n50:06.300 --> 50:08.340\n And, you know, if you're lucky enough\n\n50:08.340 --> 50:12.540\n to go to other countries, which I do,\n\n50:12.540 --> 50:14.580\n and you learn what they're thinking,\n\n50:14.580 --> 50:22.700\n then it informs what we ought to be doing in the United States.\n\n50:22.700 --> 50:25.580\n So the current administration, Donald Trump,\n\n50:25.580 --> 50:29.820\n has released an executive order on artificial intelligence.\n\n50:29.820 --> 50:31.820\n Not sure if you're familiar with it.\n\n50:31.820 --> 50:36.300\n In 2019, looking several years ahead,\n\n50:36.300 --> 50:38.740\n how does America sort of,\n\n50:38.740 --> 50:41.780\n we've mentioned in terms of the big impact,\n\n50:41.780 --> 50:47.980\n we hope your investment in MIT will have a ripple effect,\n\n50:47.980 --> 50:51.740\n but from a federal perspective, from a government perspective,\n\n50:51.740 --> 50:55.660\n how does America establish, with respect to China,\n\n50:55.660 --> 50:57.780\n leadership in the world at the top\n\n50:57.780 --> 51:00.260\n for research and development in AI?\n\n51:00.260 --> 51:04.060\n I think that you have to get the federal government\n\n51:04.060 --> 51:07.660\n in the game in a big way,\n\n51:07.660 --> 51:13.540\n and that this leap forward technologically,\n\n51:13.540 --> 51:17.340\n which is going to happen with or without us,\n\n51:17.340 --> 51:19.980\n you know, really should be with us,\n\n51:19.980 --> 51:23.500\n and it's an opportunity, in effect,\n\n51:23.500 --> 51:28.380\n for another moonshot kind of mobilization\n\n51:28.380 --> 51:30.860\n by the United States.\n\n51:30.860 --> 51:38.220\n I think the appetite actually is there to do that.\n\n51:38.220 --> 51:41.380\n At the moment, what's getting in the way\n\n51:41.380 --> 51:45.980\n is the kind of poisonous politics we have,\n\n51:45.980 --> 51:52.500\n but if you go below the lack of cooperation,\n\n51:52.500 --> 51:59.100\n which is almost the defining element of American democracy\n\n51:59.100 --> 52:00.940\n right now in the Congress,\n\n52:00.940 --> 52:04.660\n if you talk to individual members, they get it,\n\n52:04.660 --> 52:08.020\n and they would like to do something.\n\n52:08.020 --> 52:11.060\n Another part of the issue is we're running huge deficits.\n\n52:11.060 --> 52:13.820\n We're running trillion dollar plus deficits.\n\n52:13.820 --> 52:19.540\n So how much money do you need for this initiative?\n\n52:19.540 --> 52:21.460\n Where does it come from?\n\n52:21.460 --> 52:24.260\n Who's prepared to stand up for it?\n\n52:24.260 --> 52:27.100\n Because if it involves taking away resources\n\n52:27.100 --> 52:32.740\n from another area, our political system is not real flexible.\n\n52:32.740 --> 52:41.260\n To do that, if you're creating this kind of initiative,\n\n52:41.260 --> 52:45.220\n which we need, where does the money come from?\n\n52:45.220 --> 52:47.380\n And trying to get money\n\n52:47.380 --> 52:49.540\n when you've got trillion dollar deficits,\n\n52:49.540 --> 52:50.860\n in a way, could be easy.\n\n52:50.860 --> 52:52.220\n What's the difference of a trillion\n\n52:52.220 --> 52:54.580\n and a trillion and a little more?\n\n52:54.580 --> 52:58.620\n But, you know, it's hard with the mechanisms of Congress.\n\n52:58.620 --> 53:06.340\n But what's really important is this is not an issue\n\n53:06.340 --> 53:12.540\n that is unknown, and it's viewed as a very important issue.\n\n53:12.540 --> 53:15.900\n And there's almost no one in the Congress\n\n53:15.900 --> 53:18.980\n when you sit down and explain what's going on\n\n53:18.980 --> 53:22.140\n who doesn't say, we've got to do something.\n\n53:22.140 --> 53:26.020\n Let me ask the impossible question.\n\n53:26.020 --> 53:30.660\n You didn't endorse Donald Trump, but after he was elected,\n\n53:30.660 --> 53:38.860\n you have given him advice, which seems to me a great thing\n\n53:38.860 --> 53:42.060\n to do, no matter who the president is,\n\n53:42.060 --> 53:47.140\n to positively contribute to this nation by giving advice.\n\n53:47.140 --> 53:50.580\n And yet, you've received a lot of criticism for this.\n\n53:50.580 --> 53:54.100\n So on the previous topic of science and technology\n\n53:54.100 --> 53:59.740\n and government, how do we have a healthy discourse,\n\n53:59.740 --> 54:05.500\n give advice, get excited conversation with the government\n\n54:05.500 --> 54:09.620\n about science and technology without it becoming politicized?\n\n54:09.620 --> 54:12.100\n Well, it's very interesting.\n\n54:12.100 --> 54:17.260\n So when I was young, before there was a moonshot,\n\n54:17.260 --> 54:22.300\n we had a president named John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts\n\n54:22.300 --> 54:23.060\n here.\n\n54:23.060 --> 54:27.700\n And in his inaugural address as president,\n\n54:27.700 --> 54:31.700\n he asked not what your country can do for you,\n\n54:31.700 --> 54:34.860\n but what you can do for your country.\n\n54:34.860 --> 54:40.340\n We had a generation of people my age, basically people,\n\n54:40.340 --> 54:45.180\n who grew up with that credo.\n\n54:45.180 --> 54:49.980\n And sometimes you don't need to innovate.\n\n54:49.980 --> 54:52.700\n You can go back to basic principles.\n\n54:52.700 --> 54:55.860\n And that's good basic principle.\n\n54:55.860 --> 54:58.620\n What can we do?\n\n54:58.620 --> 55:04.540\n Americans have GDP per capita of around $60,000.\n\n55:04.540 --> 55:08.180\n It's not equally distributed, but it's big.\n\n55:08.180 --> 55:15.980\n And people have, I think, an obligation to help\n\n55:15.980 --> 55:17.220\n their country.\n\n55:17.220 --> 55:19.140\n And I do that.\n\n55:19.140 --> 55:28.740\n And apparently, I take some grief from some people who\n\n55:28.740 --> 55:33.580\n project on me things I don't even vaguely believe.\n\n55:33.580 --> 55:36.980\n But I'm quite simple.\n\n55:36.980 --> 55:41.060\n I tried to help the previous president, President Obama.\n\n55:41.060 --> 55:42.660\n He was a good guy.\n\n55:42.660 --> 55:44.420\n And he was a different party.\n\n55:44.420 --> 55:46.660\n And I tried to help President Bush.\n\n55:46.660 --> 55:48.580\n And he's a different party.\n\n55:48.580 --> 55:57.180\n And I sort of don't care that much about what the parties are.\n\n55:57.180 --> 56:01.420\n I care about, even though I'm a big donor for the Republicans,\n\n56:01.420 --> 56:08.220\n but what motivates me is, what are the problems we're facing?\n\n56:08.220 --> 56:13.500\n Can I help people get to a good outcome that\n\n56:13.500 --> 56:16.620\n will stand any test?\n\n56:16.620 --> 56:24.860\n But we live in a world now where the filters and the hostility\n\n56:24.860 --> 56:30.100\n is so unbelievable.\n\n56:30.100 --> 56:34.140\n In the 1960s, when I went to school and university,\n\n56:34.140 --> 56:40.060\n I went to Yale, we had so much stuff going on.\n\n56:40.060 --> 56:43.820\n We had a war called the Vietnam War.\n\n56:43.820 --> 56:47.660\n We had sort of black power starting.\n\n56:47.660 --> 56:54.580\n And we had a sexual revolution with the birth control pill.\n\n56:54.580 --> 57:02.980\n And there was one other major thing going on,\n\n57:02.980 --> 57:05.460\n the drug revolution.\n\n57:05.460 --> 57:08.020\n There hasn't been a generation that\n\n57:08.020 --> 57:17.460\n had more stuff going on in a four year period than my era.\n\n57:17.460 --> 57:23.460\n Yet, there wasn't this kind of instant hostility\n\n57:23.460 --> 57:26.220\n if you believed something different.\n\n57:26.220 --> 57:32.180\n Everybody lived together and respected the other person.\n\n57:32.180 --> 57:37.780\n And I think that this type of change needs to happen.\n\n57:37.780 --> 57:41.580\n And it's got to happen from the leadership\n\n57:41.580 --> 57:44.420\n of our major institutions.\n\n57:44.420 --> 57:48.660\n And I don't think that leaders can\n\n57:48.660 --> 57:53.780\n be bullied by people who are against sort\n\n57:53.780 --> 57:56.300\n of the classical version of free speech\n\n57:56.300 --> 58:00.420\n and letting open expression and inquiry.\n\n58:00.420 --> 58:05.420\n That's what universities are for, among other things,\n\n58:05.420 --> 58:06.820\n Socratic methods.\n\n58:06.820 --> 58:18.940\n And so I have, in the midst of this onslaught of oddness,\n\n58:18.940 --> 58:22.900\n I believe in still the basic principles.\n\n58:22.900 --> 58:26.540\n And we're going to have to find a way to get back to that.\n\n58:26.540 --> 58:31.420\n And that doesn't start with the people sort of in the middle\n\n58:31.420 --> 58:36.300\n to the bottom who are using these kinds of screens\n\n58:36.300 --> 58:41.260\n to shout people down and create an uncooperative environment.\n\n58:41.260 --> 58:46.140\n It's got to be done at the top with core principles that\n\n58:46.140 --> 58:48.340\n are articulated.\n\n58:48.340 --> 58:53.580\n And ironically, if people don't sign on\n\n58:53.580 --> 58:56.900\n to these kind of core principles where people are equal\n\n58:56.900 --> 59:02.980\n and speech can be heard and you don't have these enormous\n\n59:02.980 --> 59:06.940\n shout down biases subtly or out loud,\n\n59:06.940 --> 59:09.580\n then they don't belong at those institutions.\n\n59:09.580 --> 59:12.100\n They're violating the core principles.\n\n59:12.100 --> 59:18.180\n And that's how you end up making change.\n\n59:18.180 --> 59:21.660\n But you have to have courageous people who\n\n59:21.660 --> 59:26.220\n are willing to lay that out for the benefit of not just\n\n59:26.220 --> 59:31.620\n their institutions, but for society as a whole.\n\n59:31.620 --> 59:35.740\n So I believe that will happen.\n\n59:35.740 --> 59:41.580\n But it needs the commitment of senior people\n\n59:41.580 --> 59:42.700\n to make it happen.\n\n59:42.700 --> 59:43.660\n Courage.\n\n59:43.660 --> 59:47.820\n And I think for such great leaders, great universities,\n\n59:47.820 --> 59:49.300\n there's a huge hunger for it.\n\n59:49.300 --> 59:53.260\n So I am too very optimistic that it will come.\n\n59:53.260 --> 59:56.420\n I'm now personally taking a step into building a startup\n\n59:56.420 --> 1:00:00.740\n first time, hoping to change the world, of course.\n\n1:00:00.740 --> 1:00:03.380\n There are thousands, maybe more, maybe millions\n\n1:00:03.380 --> 1:00:06.100\n of other first time entrepreneurs like me.\n\n1:00:06.100 --> 1:00:08.060\n What advice?\n\n1:00:08.060 --> 1:00:09.420\n You've gone through this process.\n\n1:00:09.420 --> 1:00:14.060\n You've talked about the suffering, the emotional turmoil\n\n1:00:14.060 --> 1:00:15.540\n it all might entail.\n\n1:00:15.540 --> 1:00:20.220\n What advice do you have for those people taking that step?\n\n1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:23.260\n I'd say it's a rough ride.\n\n1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:28.860\n And you have to be psychologically prepared\n\n1:00:28.860 --> 1:00:33.060\n for things going wrong with frequency.\n\n1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:38.340\n You have to be prepared to be put in situations where you're\n\n1:00:38.340 --> 1:00:40.620\n being asked to solve problems you didn't even\n\n1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:43.020\n know those problems existed.\n\n1:00:43.020 --> 1:00:47.140\n For example, renting space, it's not really a problem\n\n1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:48.620\n unless you've never done it.\n\n1:00:48.620 --> 1:00:52.060\n You have no idea what a lease looks like.\n\n1:00:52.060 --> 1:00:56.820\n You don't even know the relevant rent in a market.\n\n1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:58.580\n So everything is new.\n\n1:00:58.580 --> 1:01:00.740\n Everything has to be learned.\n\n1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:04.460\n What you realize is that it's good to have other people\n\n1:01:04.460 --> 1:01:07.660\n with you who've had some experience in areas\n\n1:01:07.660 --> 1:01:09.780\n where you don't know what you're doing.\n\n1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:13.140\n Unfortunately, an entrepreneur starting\n\n1:01:13.140 --> 1:01:14.620\n doesn't know much of anything.\n\n1:01:14.620 --> 1:01:18.140\n So everything is something new.\n\n1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:24.420\n And I think it's important not to be alone,\n\n1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:28.660\n because it's sort of overwhelming.\n\n1:01:28.660 --> 1:01:33.660\n And you need somebody to talk to other than a spouse or a loved\n\n1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:38.340\n one, because even they get bored with your problems.\n\n1:01:38.340 --> 1:01:43.940\n And so getting a group, if you look at Alibaba,\n\n1:01:43.940 --> 1:01:47.580\n Jack Ma was telling me they basically\n\n1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:52.420\n were like at financial death's door at least twice.\n\n1:01:52.420 --> 1:01:55.940\n And the fact that it wasn't just Jack.\n\n1:01:55.940 --> 1:01:57.940\n I mean, people think it is, because he\n\n1:01:57.940 --> 1:02:02.420\n became the sort of public face and the driver.\n\n1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:08.380\n But a group of people who can give advice,\n\n1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:13.460\n share situations to talk about, that's really important.\n\n1:02:13.460 --> 1:02:15.900\n And that's not just referring to the small details\n\n1:02:15.900 --> 1:02:17.100\n like renting space.\n\n1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:17.600\n No.\n\n1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:20.500\n It's also the psychological burden.\n\n1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:24.700\n Yeah, and because most entrepreneurs at some point\n\n1:02:24.700 --> 1:02:27.780\n question what they're doing, because it's not going so well.\n\n1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:29.180\n Or they're screwing it up, and they\n\n1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:34.100\n don't know how to unscrew it up, because we're all learning.\n\n1:02:34.100 --> 1:02:38.700\n And it's hard to be learning when there are like 25 variables\n\n1:02:38.700 --> 1:02:39.340\n going on.\n\n1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:43.820\n If you're missing four big ones, you can really make a mess.\n\n1:02:43.820 --> 1:02:50.940\n And so the ability to, in effect, have either an outsider\n\n1:02:50.940 --> 1:02:53.340\n who's really smart that you can rely on\n\n1:02:53.340 --> 1:02:57.460\n for certain type of things, or other people who are working\n\n1:02:57.460 --> 1:03:03.380\n with you on a daily basis, most people\n\n1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:06.260\n who haven't had experience believe\n\n1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:10.700\n in the myth of the one person, one great person,\n\n1:03:10.700 --> 1:03:15.580\n makes outcomes, creates outcomes that are positive.\n\n1:03:15.580 --> 1:03:18.660\n Most of us, it's not like that.\n\n1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:22.860\n If you look back over a lot of the big successful tech\n\n1:03:22.860 --> 1:03:28.020\n companies, it's not typically one person.\n\n1:03:28.020 --> 1:03:30.860\n And you will know these stories better than I do,\n\n1:03:30.860 --> 1:03:32.400\n because it's your world, not mine.\n\n1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:35.300\n But even I know that almost every one of them\n\n1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:36.860\n had two people.\n\n1:03:36.860 --> 1:03:40.380\n If you look at Google, that's what they had.\n\n1:03:40.380 --> 1:03:43.660\n And that was the same at Microsoft at the beginning.\n\n1:03:43.660 --> 1:03:48.180\n And it was the same at Apple.\n\n1:03:48.180 --> 1:03:50.020\n People have different skills.\n\n1:03:50.020 --> 1:03:53.300\n And they need to play off of other people.\n\n1:03:53.300 --> 1:03:59.660\n So the advice that I would give you\n\n1:03:59.660 --> 1:04:03.420\n is make sure you understand that so you don't head off\n\n1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:08.280\n in some direction as a lone wolf and find that either you\n\n1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:13.740\n can't invent all the solutions or you make bad decisions\n\n1:04:13.740 --> 1:04:15.700\n on certain types of things.\n\n1:04:15.700 --> 1:04:18.020\n This is a team sport.\n\n1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:22.460\n Entrepreneur means you're alone, in effect.\n\n1:04:22.460 --> 1:04:24.260\n And that's the myth.\n\n1:04:24.260 --> 1:04:27.420\n But it's mostly a myth.\n\n1:04:27.420 --> 1:04:29.900\n Yeah, I think, and you talk about this in your book,\n\n1:04:29.900 --> 1:04:31.940\n and I could talk to you about it forever,\n\n1:04:31.940 --> 1:04:36.740\n the harshly self critical aspect to your personality\n\n1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:39.780\n and to mine as well in the face of failure.\n\n1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:41.820\n It's a powerful tool, but it's also\n\n1:04:41.820 --> 1:04:49.180\n a burden that's very interesting to walk that line.\n\n1:04:49.180 --> 1:04:53.020\n But let me ask in terms of people around you,\n\n1:04:53.020 --> 1:04:56.140\n in terms of friends, in the bigger\n\n1:04:56.140 --> 1:04:57.940\n picture of your own life, where do you\n\n1:04:57.940 --> 1:05:02.700\n put the value of love, family, friendship\n\n1:05:02.700 --> 1:05:06.580\n in the big picture journey of your life?\n\n1:05:06.580 --> 1:05:12.140\n Well, ultimately, all journeys are alone.\n\n1:05:12.140 --> 1:05:13.340\n It's great to have support.\n\n1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:23.980\n And when you go forward and say your job is\n\n1:05:23.980 --> 1:05:26.260\n to make something work, and that's your number one\n\n1:05:26.260 --> 1:05:31.500\n priority, and you're going to work at it to make it work,\n\n1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:33.900\n it's like superhuman effort.\n\n1:05:33.900 --> 1:05:38.220\n People don't become successful as part time workers.\n\n1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:40.580\n It doesn't work that way.\n\n1:05:40.580 --> 1:05:48.420\n And if you're prepared to make that 100% to 120% effort,\n\n1:05:48.420 --> 1:05:51.500\n you're going to need support, and you're\n\n1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:53.140\n going to have to have people involved\n\n1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:56.300\n with your life who understand that that's really\n\n1:05:56.300 --> 1:05:59.180\n part of your life.\n\n1:05:59.180 --> 1:06:01.580\n Sometimes you're involved with somebody,\n\n1:06:01.580 --> 1:06:04.820\n and they don't really understand that.\n\n1:06:04.820 --> 1:06:09.140\n And that's a source of conflict and difficulty.\n\n1:06:09.140 --> 1:06:13.500\n But if you're involved with the right people,\n\n1:06:13.500 --> 1:06:20.140\n whether it's a dating relationship or a spousal\n\n1:06:20.140 --> 1:06:28.820\n relationship, you have to involve them in your life,\n\n1:06:28.820 --> 1:06:36.540\n but not burden them with every minor triumph or mistake.\n\n1:06:36.540 --> 1:06:41.060\n They actually get bored with it after a while.\n\n1:06:41.060 --> 1:06:45.900\n And so you have to set up different types of ecosystems.\n\n1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:48.300\n You have your home life.\n\n1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:50.140\n You have your love life.\n\n1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:51.620\n You have children.\n\n1:06:51.620 --> 1:06:55.900\n And that's the enduring part of what you do.\n\n1:06:55.900 --> 1:07:00.420\n And then on the other side, you've got the unpredictable\n\n1:07:00.420 --> 1:07:07.220\n nature of this type of work.\n\n1:07:07.220 --> 1:07:12.980\n What I say to people at my firm who are younger, usually,\n\n1:07:12.980 --> 1:07:16.420\n well, everybody's younger, but people\n\n1:07:16.420 --> 1:07:19.780\n who are of an age where they're just\n\n1:07:19.780 --> 1:07:24.500\n having their first child, or maybe they have two children,\n\n1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:31.140\n that it's important to make sure they go away\n\n1:07:31.140 --> 1:07:37.540\n with their spouse at least once every two months to just\n\n1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:42.620\n some lovely place where there are no children, no issues,\n\n1:07:42.620 --> 1:07:45.740\n sometimes once a month if they're\n\n1:07:45.740 --> 1:07:48.380\n sort of energetic and clever.\n\n1:07:48.380 --> 1:07:49.700\n And that\n\n1:07:49.700 --> 1:07:51.740\n Escape the craziness of it all.\n\n1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:58.100\n Yeah, and reaffirm your values as a couple.\n\n1:07:58.100 --> 1:08:00.940\n And you have to have fun.\n\n1:08:00.940 --> 1:08:04.780\n If you don't have fun with the person you're with,\n\n1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:07.460\n and all you're doing is dealing with issues,\n\n1:08:07.460 --> 1:08:09.580\n then that gets pretty old.\n\n1:08:09.580 --> 1:08:14.580\n And so you have to protect the fun element of your life\n\n1:08:14.580 --> 1:08:15.540\n together.\n\n1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:18.740\n And the way to do that isn't by hanging around the house\n\n1:08:18.740 --> 1:08:22.540\n and dealing with sort of more problems.\n\n1:08:22.540 --> 1:08:27.340\n You have to get away and reinforce and reinvigorate\n\n1:08:27.340 --> 1:08:28.340\n your relationship.\n\n1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:31.740\n And whenever I tell one of our younger people about that,\n\n1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:33.540\n they sort of look at me, and it's\n\n1:08:33.540 --> 1:08:35.820\n like the scales are falling off of their eyes.\n\n1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:39.060\n And they're saying, jeez, I hadn't thought about that.\n\n1:08:39.060 --> 1:08:41.340\n I'm so enmeshed in all these things.\n\n1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:42.820\n But that's a great idea.\n\n1:08:42.820 --> 1:08:45.260\n And that's something, as an entrepreneur,\n\n1:08:45.260 --> 1:08:47.660\n you also have to do.\n\n1:08:47.660 --> 1:08:50.620\n You just can't let relationships slip\n\n1:08:50.620 --> 1:08:53.540\n because you're half overwhelmed.\n\n1:08:53.540 --> 1:08:54.300\n Beautifully put.\n\n1:08:54.300 --> 1:08:57.340\n And I think there's no better place to end it.\n\n1:08:57.340 --> 1:08:58.700\n Steve, thank you so much.\n\n1:08:58.700 --> 1:08:59.620\n I really appreciate it.\n\n1:08:59.620 --> 1:09:01.020\n It was an honor to talk to you.\n\n1:09:01.020 --> 1:09:02.820\n My pleasure.\n\n1:09:02.820 --> 1:09:04.500\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:09:04.500 --> 1:09:05.740\n with Stephen Schwarzman.\n\n1:09:05.740 --> 1:09:09.940\n And thank you to our

It's as hard to start and run a small business\n\n1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:43.780\n as it is to start a big one.\n\n1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:46.900\n You will suffer the same toll financially and psychologically\n\n1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:49.500\n as you bludgeon it into existence.\n\n1:09:50.340 --> 1:09:53.540\n It's hard to raise the money and to find the right people.\n\n1:09:53.540 --> 1:09:56.620\n So if you're going to dedicate your life to a business,\n\n1:09:56.620 --> 1:09:59.740\n which is the only way it will ever work,\n\n1:09:59.740 --> 1:10:02.660\n you should choose one with the potential to be huge.\n\n1:10:02.660 --> 1:10:15.540\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
