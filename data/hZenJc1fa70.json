00:11.360\n who was there at Ground Zero on September 11th, 2001.\n\n00:11.360 --> 00:14.160\n He was forced to retire because of the leukemia\n\n00:14.160 --> 00:17.640\n he contracted from cleaning up Ground Zero.\n\n00:17.640 --> 00:20.600\n This podcast tells his story,\n\n00:20.600 --> 00:22.840\n and the story of other great men and women\n\n00:22.840 --> 00:24.520\n who were there that day.\n\n00:24.520 --> 00:26.080\n Some of the stories we talk about\n\n00:26.080 --> 00:28.480\n are part of a new limited podcast series\n\n00:28.480 --> 00:32.200\n that Niels hosts called 20 for 20,\n\n00:32.200 --> 00:36.840\n with 20 episodes for the 20 years since 9 11.\n\n00:36.840 --> 00:38.240\n To support this podcast,\n\n00:38.240 --> 00:41.480\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n00:41.480 --> 00:44.520\n As a side note, please allow me to say a few words\n\n00:44.520 --> 00:48.400\n about the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001.\n\n00:49.320 --> 00:51.720\n I was in downtown Chicago on that day,\n\n00:51.720 --> 00:55.600\n lost in the mundane busyness of an early Tuesday morning.\n\n00:55.600 --> 00:59.400\n At that time, I was already fascinated by human nature,\n\n00:59.400 --> 01:02.000\n the best and the worst of it,\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:04.960\n exploring it through the study of history and literature.\n\n01:05.920 --> 01:09.320\n In the years before, as a young boy growing up in Russia,\n\n01:09.320 --> 01:12.200\n I saw chaos, uncertainty, and desperation\n\n01:12.200 --> 01:14.840\n in the Soviet Union of the 1990s,\n\n01:14.840 --> 01:18.360\n wrapping up a century of war and suffering.\n\n01:18.360 --> 01:20.600\n But after coming to America for me,\n\n01:20.600 --> 01:24.600\n there was a sense of hope, like all of it was behind us,\n\n01:24.600 --> 01:26.880\n a bad dream to be forgotten\n\n01:26.880 --> 01:28.800\n as we enter into the new century.\n\n01:29.880 --> 01:32.080\n On 9 11, when I saw the news\n\n01:32.080 --> 01:34.440\n of the second plane hitting the towers,\n\n01:34.440 --> 01:37.200\n my sense of hope had changed.\n\n01:37.200 --> 01:40.040\n I understood that the 21st century,\n\n01:40.040 --> 01:43.920\n like the century before, would too have its tragedies,\n\n01:43.920 --> 01:48.320\n its evildoers, its wars, and its suffering.\n\n01:48.320 --> 01:50.120\n And unlike the history books,\n\n01:50.120 --> 01:53.240\n these stories will involve all of us.\n\n01:53.240 --> 01:56.360\n They will involve me in however small\n\n01:56.360 --> 01:58.400\n and insignificant a role,\n\n01:58.400 --> 02:01.880\n but one that nevertheless carries the responsibility\n\n02:01.880 --> 02:02.720\n to help.\n\n02:03.680 --> 02:08.440\n I became an American that day, a citizen of the world.\n\n02:08.440 --> 02:10.800\n I felt the common humanity in all of us.\n\n02:10.800 --> 02:13.960\n I felt the unity and the love in the days that followed.\n\n02:13.960 --> 02:16.600\n And I think most of the world shared in this feeling\n\n02:16.600 --> 02:18.960\n that we are all in this together.\n\n02:18.960 --> 02:21.280\n Evil cannot defeat the human spirit.\n\n02:21.280 --> 02:24.960\n There were many heroes sung and unsung on that day\n\n02:24.960 --> 02:27.080\n and in the years after.\n\n02:27.080 --> 02:30.440\n Often politicians fail to rightfully honor the service\n\n02:30.440 --> 02:32.920\n and sacrifice of these heroes.\n\n02:32.920 --> 02:35.440\n There's much I could say about that,\n\n02:35.440 --> 02:37.200\n but I don't want to waste my words\n\n02:37.200 --> 02:39.720\n on the failures of weak leaders.\n\n02:39.720 --> 02:41.920\n Instead, I want to say thank you\n\n02:41.920 --> 02:45.040\n to the men and women who rushed to Ground Zero to help,\n\n02:45.040 --> 02:47.160\n who put on a uniform to serve,\n\n02:47.160 --> 02:50.760\n who make me proud to be an American and a human being,\n\n02:50.760 --> 02:54.400\n and give me hope about the future of our civilization\n\n02:54.400 --> 02:57.200\n here on a small spinning rock\n\n02:57.200 --> 02:59.120\n that despite the long odds\n\n02:59.120 --> 03:03.640\n keeps kindling the fire of human consciousness and love.\n\n03:04.680 --> 03:06.920\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast\n\n03:06.920 --> 03:10.440\n and here is my conversation with Niels Jorgensen.\n\n03:11.440 --> 03:14.920\n Take me through the day of September 11th, 2001\n\n03:14.920 --> 03:17.240\n as you experienced it, as you lived it.\n\n03:17.240 --> 03:20.760\n September 11th, 2001 was a bright, beautiful,\n\n03:20.760 --> 03:22.560\n sunny Tuesday morning.\n\n03:22.560 --> 03:24.000\n It was a late summer.\n\n03:25.640 --> 03:27.920\n There's a lot of folks who go to the beaches in New Jersey\n\n03:27.920 --> 03:29.280\n and call it the short summer.\n\n03:29.280 --> 03:30.720\n Everybody's left there for Labor Day,\n\n03:30.720 --> 03:33.720\n but it's still beautiful enough to enjoy the weather.\n\n03:35.160 --> 03:37.840\n I left my house about 6.30 in the morning\n\n03:37.840 --> 03:42.600\n and my four and a half year old daughter said to me,\n\n03:42.600 --> 03:47.200\n daddy, which truck are you driving today, the fire truck,\n\n03:47.200 --> 03:49.240\n the oil truck, or the boar's head truck?\n\n03:49.240 --> 03:51.920\n Because I had three jobs at the time.\n\n03:52.960 --> 03:56.440\n Most New York City firefighters and police officers, EMS,\n\n03:56.440 --> 03:58.720\n we don't make the most amount of money.\n\n03:58.720 --> 04:01.840\n So in order to live in that city, you have to hustle.\n\n04:01.840 --> 04:04.680\n And my wife stayed at home raising the children.\n\n04:05.760 --> 04:08.920\n So my daughter said, oh, so you should be safe\n\n04:08.920 --> 04:10.320\n because you're on the oil truck.\n\n04:10.320 --> 04:13.080\n I told her I was going on the oil truck that day.\n\n04:13.080 --> 04:14.920\n So she said, you should be safe today, daddy.\n\n04:14.920 --> 04:18.200\n So I left and worked for this great company\n\n04:18.200 --> 04:20.800\n on the North Shore, Staten Island, Quinlan Fuel.\n\n04:20.800 --> 04:23.640\n Very nice people, treated me very well.\n\n04:23.640 --> 04:26.720\n And it was my first day back actually for the winter season.\n\n04:27.640 --> 04:30.000\n Usually get laid off a couple months in the summer\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.240\n because things, you know, too hot to need oil.\n\n04:33.360 --> 04:36.040\n So I took the truck, started my route that day\n\n04:36.040 --> 04:38.760\n and plane to New Jersey.\n\n04:38.760 --> 04:41.400\n And plane hit the tower.\n\n04:42.320 --> 04:44.320\n So initially I'm like, oh, it's probably\n\n04:44.320 --> 04:46.040\n some silly Lear jet pilot.\n\n04:46.040 --> 04:48.240\n And he veered off track to get a better picture\n\n04:48.240 --> 04:50.600\n for a client and he hit the building.\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:55.320\n Probably hit a, you know, bad turbulence, gust of wind.\n\n04:55.320 --> 04:57.280\n It's very windy down in that area in Manhattan.\n\n04:57.280 --> 04:58.640\n So that was my first thought.\n\n04:58.640 --> 05:00.560\n Can we pause there for a second?\n\n05:00.560 --> 05:03.840\n So 6.30 a.m. you wake up, you leave,\n\n05:03.840 --> 05:08.720\n and then the plane hits at 8.45 a.m.\n\n05:08.720 --> 05:11.320\n It's just interesting how you phrase it.\n\n05:11.320 --> 05:14.600\n So how did you hear that a plane hit something?\n\n05:16.720 --> 05:20.320\n I'm a big news radio guy, news guy, bit of a buff.\n\n05:20.320 --> 05:21.960\n I've been that way since I was a kid\n\n05:21.960 --> 05:26.880\n and I had the news radio on the local New York radio station.\n\n05:26.880 --> 05:28.960\n And as I was driving the truck,\n\n05:28.960 --> 05:33.160\n I heard, you know, an emergency report.\n\n05:33.160 --> 05:35.600\n This just in, aircraft has just struck\n\n05:35.600 --> 05:37.200\n the World Trade Center.\n\n05:37.200 --> 05:39.280\n And where Quinlan's is located,\n\n05:39.280 --> 05:41.480\n it's on the north rim of Staten Island,\n\n05:41.480 --> 05:43.360\n which is right on New York Harbor.\n\n05:43.360 --> 05:46.840\n And you could see Statue of Liberty,\n\n05:46.840 --> 05:48.960\n you know, a mile or two away in your distance.\n\n05:48.960 --> 05:51.920\n And then past that is the towers.\n\n05:51.920 --> 05:54.680\n So I just literally stopped the truck and looked out\n\n05:54.680 --> 05:56.360\n and I saw the smoke.\n\n05:56.360 --> 05:57.280\n So there was smoke?\n\n05:57.280 --> 05:58.640\n Oh, it was dark, black smoke.\n\n05:58.640 --> 05:59.800\n It was just, yeah, I mean,\n\n05:59.800 --> 06:03.320\n it was burning fully at that point.\n\n06:03.320 --> 06:06.080\n Did you have fear of what the hell happened?\n\n06:06.080 --> 06:08.440\n Or is it? I was initially scared\n\n06:08.440 --> 06:10.720\n for anybody involved.\n\n06:10.720 --> 06:13.760\n I realized, I said, there's gonna be lots of fatalities,\n\n06:13.760 --> 06:15.840\n obviously, depending on the size of the aircraft.\n\n06:15.840 --> 06:19.760\n And, you know, the business day there\n\n06:19.760 --> 06:21.680\n had started probably at 8, 8.30.\n\n06:21.680 --> 06:24.280\n So those buildings should have been packed at that moment.\n\n06:24.280 --> 06:26.720\n So that was a thought that crossed my mind.\n\n06:27.800 --> 06:31.120\n But from our being responder perspective,\n\n06:31.120 --> 06:35.920\n if you're off duty, normally you do not go to a scene\n\n06:35.920 --> 06:37.080\n that they don't want you to\n\n06:37.080 --> 06:38.920\n because of accountability and safety.\n\n06:40.240 --> 06:42.320\n The on duty platoon will handle it.\n\n06:42.320 --> 06:44.800\n And if it's something very horrific,\n\n06:44.800 --> 06:46.640\n then they will have something called a recall,\n\n06:46.640 --> 06:50.120\n which is any police firefighter or EMS personnel\n\n06:50.120 --> 06:54.520\n is obligated to go to their command immediately,\n\n06:54.520 --> 06:58.280\n check in with, you know, their command to get their gear\n\n06:58.280 --> 07:01.400\n and stand by and await orders for deployment\n\n07:01.400 --> 07:06.400\n or to remain in that command for routine duties.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:09.960\n How often throughout history have there been recalls?\n\n07:09.960 --> 07:14.960\n I believe the one prior to that was like in the 1968 riots,\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.160\n possibly, and then maybe in the 70s,\n\n07:17.160 --> 07:19.320\n there was another blackout and riots.\n\n07:19.320 --> 07:21.320\n And I remember my dad talking about it.\n\n07:21.320 --> 07:23.320\n And he actually always said,\n\n07:23.320 --> 07:26.080\n just remember if something bad's going down,\n\n07:26.080 --> 07:29.920\n don't just rush in, you will wait the recall.\n\n07:29.920 --> 07:32.000\n Or at the very least, if there isn't a recall,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:33.560\n you get to your firehouse.\n\n07:34.480 --> 07:37.800\n And because if you show up somewhere,\n\n07:37.800 --> 07:39.920\n there's a good chance that no one knows you're there.\n\n07:39.920 --> 07:44.920\n And now you, in your well intended movements,\n\n07:45.040 --> 07:48.520\n you get lost or trapped or no one's looking for you.\n\n07:48.520 --> 07:51.240\n So that's the whole thing with, you know, checking in.\n\n07:51.240 --> 07:55.160\n And now you're with a squad or, you know, group of guys\n\n07:55.160 --> 07:57.160\n and everyone knows, you know,\n\n07:57.160 --> 07:58.520\n hey, there's Nels, there's Lex.\n\n07:58.520 --> 08:00.600\n Okay, they're on, you know, this team.\n\n08:01.960 --> 08:05.560\n So I said, all right, they're not gonna need us.\n\n08:05.560 --> 08:07.320\n It's probably gonna be a fifth alarm.\n\n08:07.320 --> 08:10.360\n And you know, there'll be 250 firefighters there.\n\n08:10.360 --> 08:11.200\n They'll handle it.\n\n08:11.200 --> 08:13.020\n It's gonna be a bad day for those guys,\n\n08:13.020 --> 08:16.280\n but you know, our guys take on some heavy stuff\n\n08:16.280 --> 08:17.240\n and they'll be fine.\n\n08:18.400 --> 08:20.800\n A few minutes later, the second plane hit\n\n08:20.800 --> 08:25.560\n and I knew immediately, I'm like, okay, we're under attack.\n\n08:25.560 --> 08:27.400\n So I just flew the truck back in.\n\n08:27.400 --> 08:30.840\n I told my boss, I have to go.\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:33.000\n He understood, he knew something was way wrong\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.640\n and I just was flying.\n\n08:35.640 --> 08:38.720\n At the time, I actually had a yellow Volkswagen Beetle,\n\n08:38.720 --> 08:41.280\n kind of a goofy car to be driving, but I loved it.\n\n08:41.280 --> 08:42.720\n So for people who are just listening,\n\n08:42.720 --> 08:43.880\n you're kind of a big guy.\n\n08:43.880 --> 08:47.200\n Well, yeah, I definitely need to lose about 50 pounds.\n\n08:47.200 --> 08:50.360\n No, I don't mean in that way, your frame, big hands.\n\n08:50.360 --> 08:53.080\n As my beloved friend, Bobby Adams would say to me,\n\n08:54.040 --> 08:55.880\n I was driving around in a clown wagon\n\n08:55.880 --> 08:59.480\n and he also says, I have a waving hairdo, waving bye bye.\n\n08:59.480 --> 09:00.520\n So thanks, Bobby.\n\n09:01.760 --> 09:03.400\n But yeah, he's a great friend.\n\n09:03.400 --> 09:05.680\n Yeah, so I took the Volkswagen and I flew in\n\n09:05.680 --> 09:07.640\n and I was heading over to Verrazano Bridge\n\n09:07.640 --> 09:09.920\n and hit the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.\n\n09:11.760 --> 09:15.720\n And my phone rang and my wife normally doesn't curse\n\n09:15.720 --> 09:17.280\n or raise a voice and she was yelling at me.\n\n09:17.280 --> 09:20.400\n And she said, don't go in there, go to your firehouse.\n\n09:20.400 --> 09:22.440\n Well, first she asked, well, she knew I was on the way,\n\n09:22.440 --> 09:24.280\n but she just wanted to know where.\n\n09:24.280 --> 09:28.960\n And I said, I'm on the curve, which is 65th Street\n\n09:28.960 --> 09:31.720\n on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway called Dead Man's Curve.\n\n09:31.720 --> 09:34.440\n We actually used to do a lot of car wrecks up there.\n\n09:35.360 --> 09:37.560\n And I was hitting that curve pretty fast.\n\n09:37.560 --> 09:40.560\n And then right around the curve is the exit to the firehouse.\n\n09:40.560 --> 09:43.200\n And I had to decide, well, am I driving right in\n\n09:43.200 --> 09:45.040\n to the battery tunnel to the city\n\n09:46.240 --> 09:47.600\n or am I going to the firehouse?\n\n09:47.600 --> 09:49.400\n And then I said, but I have no gear.\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.200\n I'm gonna be ineffective.\n\n09:52.200 --> 09:55.080\n How do I show up with no gear, no protection, you know?\n\n09:55.080 --> 09:59.760\n So she said, do what your dad would follow the recall,\n\n09:59.760 --> 10:00.600\n go to the firehouse.\n\n10:00.600 --> 10:04.000\n And I hung up the phone, said, I love you, gotta go.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:05.560\n And I did, I went to the firehouse\n\n10:05.560 --> 10:07.600\n and I'm glad I listened to her.\n\n10:07.600 --> 10:09.640\n I had my father ringing in my ears.\n\n10:09.640 --> 10:13.080\n My dad, beautiful guy, he's 82.\n\n10:13.080 --> 10:16.200\n He did 34 years in the New York City Fire Department.\n\n10:16.200 --> 10:19.160\n He came down on end stage, non\n\n10:19.160 --> 10:25.120\n and he's 38 back in, going on 39, 1978.\n\n10:26.840 --> 10:31.600\n And this guy, he's my hero.\n\n10:31.600 --> 10:34.960\n He was gonna die, they sent him home.\n\n10:34.960 --> 10:37.160\n They said, there's really not much we can do.\n\n10:37.160 --> 10:38.480\n Go get your affairs in order.\n\n10:38.480 --> 10:41.480\n And he says, but doc, I have three young kids.\n\n10:41.480 --> 10:45.120\n And she called him a couple hours later.\n\n10:45.120 --> 10:47.560\n She said, I got in touch with Sloan Kettering\n\n10:47.560 --> 11:16.840\n and they have a new drug.\n\n11:16.840 --> 11:46.800\n So I'll take you to the hospital.\n\n11:46.800 --> 11:48.820\n and do the same exact reverse route\n\n11:48.820 --> 11:50.700\n and he'd get to the cancer center\n\n11:51.820 --> 11:55.860\n and my mom would meet him and he'd get his infusion\n\n11:55.860 --> 11:58.380\n and within two hours he'd be violently ill\n\n11:58.380 --> 12:01.900\n for a few days, really badly ill.\n\n12:02.780 --> 12:06.140\n And I just remember, yeah, I was 10 years old\n\n12:06.140 --> 12:09.620\n and he just had to have the room darkened out\n\n12:09.620 --> 12:11.900\n and he'd be so sick and I'd just go in\n\n12:11.900 --> 12:14.720\n and wipe the vomit on his face,\n\n12:14.720 --> 12:15.960\n just try to give him a little water\n\n12:15.960 --> 12:18.620\n but he couldn't take it down because he'd throw it up.\n\n12:19.860 --> 12:24.860\n And maybe on Saturday he'd start coming around a little bit,\n\n12:25.680 --> 12:27.420\n drink down a little bit of tea\n\n12:27.420 --> 12:29.540\n and on Sunday morning he'd put his robe on\n\n12:29.540 --> 12:33.260\n and he'd go down, mom would make him black coffee and toast\n\n12:33.260 --> 12:37.260\n and he'd sit up, watch the news, watch a game\n\n12:37.260 --> 12:39.220\n and then Monday morning he'd go back to work.\n\n12:39.220 --> 12:40.620\n He did that for four years.\n\n12:41.500 --> 12:43.880\n And he's 82 and he's still here.\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:44.720\n Yeah.\n\n12:45.940 --> 12:48.580\n You said that your dad's a man of a few words\n\n12:48.580 --> 12:50.940\n but when he talks, they're profound.\n\n12:50.940 --> 12:54.100\n So what words were ringing in your ear\n\n12:54.100 --> 12:54.940\n when you were driving?\n\n12:54.940 --> 12:56.540\n I just always remember him saying,\n\n12:56.540 --> 13:00.100\n kid, they give the recall, you go to the firehouse,\n\n13:00.100 --> 13:02.420\n you don't go where you think you should,\n\n13:02.420 --> 13:05.100\n you go to the firehouse, you follow your orders.\n\n13:05.100 --> 13:07.100\n So do the smart thing, do your job.\n\n13:07.100 --> 13:07.940\n Yes, sir.\n\n13:07.940 --> 13:09.860\n And every time we'd hang up the phone,\n\n13:09.860 --> 13:14.060\n it's fireman talk, he'd say, I love you, keep low.\n\n13:14.060 --> 13:15.420\n My dad couldn't tell me he loved me\n\n13:15.420 --> 13:19.340\n until I told him when I first got on a fire\n\n13:19.340 --> 13:22.740\n upon when I was 22 and my dad grew up in a tough household.\n\n13:22.740 --> 13:25.820\n My granddad was a good man, but a tormented man.\n\n13:25.820 --> 13:29.040\n He was sent away from home at 12 years old.\n\n13:30.340 --> 13:33.680\n He was from Denmark and I'm named after him, Grandpa Nils.\n\n13:34.580 --> 13:39.100\n And I think his demons took up a large part of his life.\n\n13:39.100 --> 13:42.540\n His anger, whatever it was, his fear.\n\n13:42.540 --> 13:44.700\n We got the sense that maybe when he was a child,\n\n13:44.700 --> 13:46.780\n he was an apprentice baker,\n\n13:46.780 --> 13:49.940\n living with strangers, working for them.\n\n13:49.940 --> 13:51.800\n And we think maybe he was abused\n\n13:51.800 --> 13:54.140\n and that's why he took it out on my dad\n\n13:54.140 --> 13:55.340\n and my grandma and my aunts.\n\n13:55.340 --> 14:00.340\n But they made it up to each other\n\n14:00.540 --> 14:01.900\n at the end of my granddad's life.\n\n14:01.900 --> 14:04.660\n My granddad turned out to be the best grandfather ever.\n\n14:04.660 --> 14:07.300\n I think he tried to heal and heal everyone\n\n14:07.300 --> 14:08.740\n by his change of behavior.\n\n14:08.740 --> 14:12.180\n So he's proof that you can change,\n\n14:12.180 --> 14:14.280\n you can improve if you work on it.\n\n14:14.280 --> 14:16.900\n But I know I'm going off track here, but.\n\n14:16.900 --> 14:18.100\n But you were man enough in your,\n\n14:18.100 --> 14:19.660\n you say in your 20s to tell your dad.\n\n14:19.660 --> 14:20.500\n To my dad, yeah.\n\n14:20.500 --> 14:22.680\n And my dad, I got on a job.\n\n14:23.740 --> 14:25.220\n He said, how'd it go, kid?\n\n14:25.220 --> 14:27.580\n That was the tour, we called it Tour of Duty.\n\n14:27.580 --> 14:30.540\n I said, oh, dad, it was great, it was great, I love it.\n\n14:30.540 --> 14:32.660\n And he goes, well, just remember, you keep low,\n\n14:32.660 --> 14:34.220\n you always keep low.\n\n14:34.220 --> 14:37.860\n And keep low means you stay down below the flames,\n\n14:37.860 --> 14:40.540\n if a room flashes over and it's burning,\n\n14:40.540 --> 14:42.700\n if you stay up high, you're gonna get burned badly.\n\n14:42.700 --> 14:45.300\n But if you get down on your belly and you crawl,\n\n14:45.300 --> 14:46.140\n you'll get out.\n\n14:47.900 --> 14:49.980\n So he'd always say that when he'd hang up the phone.\n\n14:49.980 --> 14:51.540\n And I said, well, I love you, pop.\n\n14:51.540 --> 14:53.380\n And he says, well, thanks, kid.\n\n14:53.380 --> 14:56.100\n I said, well, you can say it too.\n\n14:57.300 --> 14:58.540\n Oh, nice, you pressured him.\n\n14:58.540 --> 14:59.860\n And he did, and he said it.\n\n14:59.860 --> 15:01.580\n And now every time we talk, he says it.\n\n15:01.580 --> 15:06.060\n So, you know, they talk about masculinity and whatnot.\n\n15:06.060 --> 15:09.140\n And my dad is one of those tough, tough guys\n\n15:09.140 --> 15:10.340\n with a soft edge.\n\n15:10.340 --> 15:14.380\n And that's how he brought me up, you know,\n\n15:14.380 --> 15:15.740\n to be a protector.\n\n15:15.740 --> 15:16.580\n I hate bullies.\n\n15:16.580 --> 15:18.740\n I was bullied really badly as a kid,\n\n15:18.740 --> 15:21.220\n and I really hated it.\n\n15:21.220 --> 15:24.700\n And now I find myself sometimes throwing myself\n\n15:24.700 --> 15:28.220\n into situations to protect people that are being,\n\n15:28.220 --> 15:30.220\n you know, violated and hurt.\n\n15:30.220 --> 15:32.820\n And I just can't walk away from it.\n\n15:32.820 --> 15:33.780\n But that's my dad.\n\n15:33.780 --> 15:36.500\n My dad was that, you know, just a great guy.\n\n15:36.500 --> 15:37.340\n But anyway, yeah.\n\n15:37.340 --> 15:39.300\n You still listen to, therefore, see,\n\n15:39.300 --> 15:43.140\n you probably went to rush right to the towers,\n\n15:43.140 --> 15:43.980\n but you went.\n\n15:43.980 --> 15:46.300\n Yeah, so anyway, I got, I did, I listened to him.\n\n15:46.300 --> 15:47.140\n I listened to my wife.\n\n15:47.140 --> 15:49.020\n I went to the firehouse, and it was really strange.\n\n15:49.020 --> 15:52.460\n It was eerie because the computer dispatch system\n\n15:52.460 --> 15:56.580\n was still beeping, which meant it sent a dispatch,\n\n15:56.580 --> 15:58.660\n and the truck received it.\n\n15:58.660 --> 16:01.300\n Ladder 114, my truck company received it,\n\n16:01.300 --> 16:03.180\n and they left, they were gone.\n\n16:03.180 --> 16:06.740\n So it was this beautiful old building built in the 1880s\n\n16:06.740 --> 16:11.700\n with a spiral staircase, just a narrow old brick garage,\n\n16:11.700 --> 16:13.100\n and it was empty.\n\n16:13.100 --> 16:15.460\n And I just heard the computer chirping.\n\n16:15.460 --> 16:17.220\n And I looked down on a ticket, and it said,\n\n16:17.220 --> 16:20.620\n Ladder 114, respond, the Vessian West World Trade Center\n\n16:20.620 --> 16:23.220\n aircraft into building.\n\n16:23.220 --> 16:26.100\n And I said, oh, God, I just hope they're not on a death ride\n\n16:26.100 --> 16:31.740\n because this now was two towers, and they were burning.\n\n16:31.740 --> 16:33.460\n They were free burning, and I knew\n\n16:33.460 --> 16:35.780\n this was really, really bad.\n\n16:35.780 --> 16:38.780\n And I got on the phone, and I called command right away.\n\n16:38.780 --> 16:43.180\n I called the 40th Battalion, and Chief's aide just said, look,\n\n16:43.180 --> 16:44.020\n get 12 guys.\n\n16:44.020 --> 16:45.860\n Sign them in to the journal.\n\n16:45.860 --> 16:48.340\n There's a journal of daily events.\n\n16:48.340 --> 16:50.980\n Everything that takes place in the firehouse 24 seven\n\n16:50.980 --> 16:53.540\n has to be logged.\n\n16:53.540 --> 16:57.820\n And I logged myself as coming in, reporting for duty.\n\n16:57.820 --> 17:00.060\n And as the guys came in, I logged them in.\n\n17:00.060 --> 17:03.780\n And then one of our lieutenants took command.\n\n17:03.780 --> 17:05.900\n We grabbed up a bunch of gear, and they basically\n\n17:05.900 --> 17:09.380\n told us, get 12 guys, get a city bus,\n\n17:09.380 --> 17:13.700\n and get down to the battery tunnel they said\n\n17:13.700 --> 17:15.260\n would probably be closed.\n\n17:15.260 --> 17:17.660\n There was threats it was going to be blown up\n\n17:17.660 --> 17:20.340\n to get to the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\n17:20.340 --> 17:22.820\n And so we did.\n\n17:22.820 --> 17:23.900\n We got a city bus.\n\n17:23.900 --> 17:26.300\n We flagged it down, and the bus driver said, I'm sorry.\n\n17:26.300 --> 17:27.380\n I can't give you the bus.\n\n17:27.380 --> 17:28.340\n I will drive you.\n\n17:28.340 --> 17:30.900\n And he took us, and we stopped at Engine 201,\n\n17:30.900 --> 17:35.620\n which is just about a quarter mile down the road from us.\n\n17:35.620 --> 17:37.740\n That's our affiliated engine company,\n\n17:37.740 --> 17:44.580\n and my childhood best friend here, Johnny Schardt,\n\n17:44.580 --> 17:46.460\n he was assigned there, and he was on shift.\n\n17:46.460 --> 17:51.300\n And then they went through the tunnel.\n\n17:51.300 --> 17:55.500\n And we picked up those guys, the off duty guys from 201,\n\n17:55.500 --> 17:57.300\n and then we kept going down Fourth Avenue,\n\n17:57.300 --> 18:00.220\n and we picked up 239's crew.\n\n18:00.220 --> 18:01.860\n And then we hightailed it down the bridge,\n\n18:01.860 --> 18:04.020\n and there was a lot of traffic.\n\n18:04.020 --> 18:05.900\n There was a lot of people fleeing,\n\n18:05.900 --> 18:11.340\n coming over the bridge in waves, so it affected the inbound.\n\n18:11.340 --> 18:14.220\n What was the mood like among the crew?\n\n18:14.220 --> 18:17.460\n It was somber, because just prior to getting on the bus,\n\n18:17.460 --> 18:20.180\n the first tower went down.\n\n18:20.180 --> 18:27.100\n So we figured that I heard 114, my lieutenant, Dennis Oberg,\n\n18:27.100 --> 18:28.020\n heard him on the radio.\n\n18:28.020 --> 18:34.380\n And he said, 114, Manhattan, we're on your frequency.\n\n18:34.380 --> 18:35.260\n What do you need us?\n\n18:35.260 --> 18:38.380\n And they said, Tally Ho, which is our nickname.\n\n18:38.380 --> 18:42.140\n Tally Ho, respond to the Vessian West to the command post\n\n18:42.140 --> 18:44.260\n and receive your orders.\n\n18:44.260 --> 18:47.460\n And I heard Dennis say, Tally Ho, 10 4.\n\n18:47.460 --> 18:52.660\n And Dennis, a little while after that,\n\n18:52.660 --> 18:57.060\n they were proceeding to go into, I believe it was,\n\n18:57.060 --> 18:58.460\n I get this mixed up, and I'm sorry.\n\n18:58.460 --> 19:00.260\n I should know this by the back of my hand,\n\n19:00.260 --> 19:02.340\n but sometimes it's just such a haze.\n\n19:02.340 --> 19:06.620\n But the second tower hit was the first one to go down.\n\n19:06.620 --> 19:08.900\n And they were heading over to go in it.\n\n19:08.900 --> 19:10.540\n And all of a sudden, he looked up,\n\n19:10.540 --> 19:12.900\n and he saw what he thought to be disintegration.\n\n19:12.900 --> 19:14.420\n And he turned the guys around.\n\n19:14.420 --> 19:15.020\n He said, run.\n\n19:15.020 --> 19:15.540\n Just run.\n\n19:15.540 --> 19:16.260\n Don't look back.\n\n19:16.260 --> 19:16.900\n Don't look up.\n\n19:16.900 --> 19:18.180\n Go.\n\n19:18.180 --> 19:20.340\n They sprinted as fast as they could.\n\n19:20.340 --> 19:23.620\n And they dove under a fire truck.\n\n19:23.620 --> 19:26.340\n And the guys that were sprinting behind him 40 feet away\n\n19:26.340 --> 19:29.860\n were underneath a pile that was 10 stories deep.\n\n19:29.860 --> 19:31.940\n They were killed.\n\n19:31.940 --> 19:37.020\n And just further into that pile was his rookie son, Dennis's\n\n19:37.020 --> 19:39.660\n rookie son, who was working in Ladder 105, which\n\n19:39.660 --> 19:42.140\n was my first command under the department.\n\n19:42.140 --> 19:45.940\n I worked for it, proudly served for three years.\n\n19:45.940 --> 19:49.060\n And just aside them was my childhood best friend,\n\n19:49.060 --> 19:53.300\n John Chard, and his crew from 201.\n\n19:53.300 --> 19:59.260\n And they were all killed.\n\n19:59.260 --> 20:05.820\n And a strange irony to that is that Dennis's son, Dennis Jr.,\n\n20:05.820 --> 20:10.340\n was working underneath, under the wing of a senior man,\n\n20:10.340 --> 20:10.940\n as we say.\n\n20:10.940 --> 20:13.020\n A senior man is a guy with a lot of experience.\n\n20:13.020 --> 20:18.140\n And he'll watch over you, make sure you don't veer off,\n\n20:18.140 --> 20:19.740\n like I veer off a lot in talking.\n\n20:19.740 --> 20:24.020\n And you don't veer off, and you get yourself hurt.\n\n20:24.020 --> 20:28.340\n In the morning of 1993 bombing, Henry Miller was my senior man.\n\n20:35.700 --> 20:38.620\n And I was the young guy under his wing.\n\n20:38.620 --> 20:41.180\n And he protected me.\n\n20:41.180 --> 20:43.100\n And toward the end of the day, he looked around.\n\n20:43.100 --> 20:46.220\n He said, kid, it's a bad day.\n\n20:46.220 --> 20:48.860\n He said, they didn't do it right.\n\n20:48.860 --> 20:51.140\n They blew it up in the middle.\n\n20:51.140 --> 20:53.700\n If they did it in a corner, they would\n\n20:53.700 --> 20:57.420\n have dropped this building half a mile down at Canal Street.\n\n20:57.420 --> 20:58.500\n But don't kid yourself.\n\n20:58.500 --> 20:59.920\n They'll be back, and they'll do it.\n\n20:59.920 --> 21:02.340\n And they'll do it right next time.\n\n21:02.340 --> 21:03.980\n And it's so strange and so prophetic,\n\n21:03.980 --> 21:06.740\n because he was there with them.\n\n21:06.740 --> 21:07.900\n He died with Dennis.\n\n21:07.900 --> 21:09.500\n He knew it.\n\n21:09.500 --> 21:11.860\n And like 1994, we had a training manual\n\n21:11.860 --> 21:14.980\n with a picture of the towers with a target.\n\n21:14.980 --> 21:18.780\n And this is not a matter of if, but a matter\n\n21:18.780 --> 21:22.060\n of when, be prepared.\n\n21:22.060 --> 21:22.900\n And it's haunting.\n\n21:22.900 --> 21:25.100\n It was like people knew, right?\n\n21:25.100 --> 21:27.580\n And we didn't stop it.\n\n21:27.580 --> 21:33.060\n And so we got off the bus, but just prior to that,\n\n21:33.060 --> 21:36.540\n coming over the bridge of the second tower, it's gone now.\n\n21:36.540 --> 21:38.340\n And we're just destroyed, because we're like,\n\n21:38.340 --> 21:39.060\n our guys are there.\n\n21:39.060 --> 21:39.980\n They're all in there.\n\n21:39.980 --> 21:43.860\n Now we're feeling like cowards, because we got there late.\n\n21:43.860 --> 21:45.940\n And initially, we're thinking there's\n\n21:45.940 --> 21:49.540\n 500 guys that are gone, because there was a tent alarm\n\n21:49.540 --> 21:56.980\n assignment, which means 50, 60 fire trucks, five to six guys\n\n21:56.980 --> 22:00.060\n per, you know, you're looking at.\n\n22:00.060 --> 22:02.420\n At least there was even more tent alarm,\n\n22:02.420 --> 22:04.780\n plus multiple alarms on top of it.\n\n22:04.780 --> 22:07.180\n There was a dispatch, basically equivalent of five\n\n22:07.180 --> 22:10.260\n to 600 firefighters.\n\n22:10.260 --> 22:12.780\n We figured, oh, they're all in there, all gone.\n\n22:12.780 --> 22:15.220\n All the police officers, Port Authority police,\n\n22:15.220 --> 22:18.820\n NYPD police, court officers just up the street\n\n22:18.820 --> 22:23.940\n from the courts, transit cops from the train tunnels.\n\n22:23.940 --> 22:26.420\n Like, just, you know, we knew everybody was going there,\n\n22:26.420 --> 22:28.540\n and now they're gone.\n\n22:28.540 --> 22:31.180\n So what you saw, what were we looking at?\n\n22:31.180 --> 22:32.820\n What did it look like?\n\n22:32.820 --> 22:37.260\n So you saw rubble, and then you knew that many, that 105\n\n22:37.260 --> 22:41.300\n and 201, many of those guys are in the, they're dead.\n\n22:41.300 --> 22:43.500\n Yeah, and we thought 114 was in there, too.\n\n22:43.500 --> 22:44.860\n We didn't realize at that point.\n\n22:44.860 --> 22:47.540\n We didn't even realize that they had gotten under that truck.\n\n22:47.540 --> 22:48.700\n We thought they were all gone.\n\n22:48.700 --> 22:53.340\n But yeah, it looked like, it looked like a movie scene\n\n22:53.340 --> 22:56.140\n with just end of the earth destruction.\n\n22:56.140 --> 23:01.140\n It's just massive piles of intertwined steel,\n\n23:01.140 --> 23:02.540\n what was left of the steel.\n\n23:02.540 --> 23:05.020\n And you know, there was no cement.\n\n23:05.020 --> 23:06.340\n It was all just dust.\n\n23:06.340 --> 23:12.300\n And it was just a burning pile of dust and concrete\n\n23:12.300 --> 23:13.420\n and plastic.\n\n23:13.420 --> 23:15.700\n And it was just, everything was just pulverized.\n\n23:15.700 --> 23:20.700\n And it was truly hard to mentally compute that.\n\n23:20.700 --> 23:22.420\n Like, it was like, what?\n\n23:22.420 --> 23:25.900\n And then there was just fighter jets, a couple of fighter jets\n\n23:25.900 --> 23:26.980\n just circling.\n\n23:26.980 --> 23:31.220\n And you just heard them flying by over your head.\n\n23:31.220 --> 23:32.940\n I mean, you'd literally see the guy banking\n\n23:32.940 --> 23:35.300\n a turn around a Brooklyn bridge and just coming back.\n\n23:35.300 --> 23:38.660\n And I'm like, holy shoot, we're under attack?\n\n23:38.660 --> 23:41.820\n And we couldn't really get concrete intel\n\n23:41.820 --> 23:43.860\n as to what exactly we knew planes.\n\n23:43.860 --> 23:47.300\n But then we kept hearing there was multiple devices.\n\n23:47.300 --> 23:49.620\n There was devices in a battery tunnel.\n\n23:49.620 --> 23:51.860\n And there was devices on a George Washington bridge\n\n23:51.860 --> 23:52.940\n and in the subways.\n\n23:52.940 --> 23:54.820\n And it was just chaos.\n\n23:54.820 --> 23:56.780\n It was, I mean, we kept it together, obviously,\n\n23:56.780 --> 23:58.340\n because that's kind of, we try.\n\n23:58.340 --> 23:59.700\n That's what we do.\n\n23:59.700 --> 24:03.900\n But the just constant barrage of different reports,\n\n24:03.900 --> 24:06.020\n it was like, holy shoot.\n\n24:06.020 --> 24:07.940\n And then as we were being deployed,\n\n24:07.940 --> 24:09.180\n it was a little frustrating.\n\n24:09.180 --> 24:11.220\n But they were trying to take command and send us\n\n24:11.220 --> 24:13.460\n in groups now because they realized\n\n24:13.460 --> 24:15.900\n we have to start searching this.\n\n24:15.900 --> 24:20.220\n You could hear the alarms on the Scott Air Mask, the packs\n\n24:20.220 --> 24:22.180\n we wear to go into the building.\n\n24:22.180 --> 24:23.340\n It has a motion alarm.\n\n24:23.340 --> 24:25.220\n And if you stop moving for 30 seconds,\n\n24:25.220 --> 24:29.780\n it just sounds like this whining, just screaming bell.\n\n24:29.780 --> 24:32.780\n And it just keeps going and going.\n\n24:32.780 --> 24:35.580\n And you could hear multiple units of those going off.\n\n24:35.580 --> 24:37.620\n And you're like, wait a minute.\n\n24:37.620 --> 24:38.900\n There's guys with those.\n\n24:38.900 --> 24:40.300\n Where are they?\n\n24:40.300 --> 24:42.460\n And it's emanating from underneath the pile.\n\n24:42.460 --> 24:51.460\n And it was just surreal and truly like a war zone.\n\n24:51.460 --> 24:53.780\n I mean, I was a soldier in the reserves.\n\n24:53.780 --> 24:55.020\n And I never saw combat.\n\n24:55.020 --> 24:56.420\n And I would never claim that I did.\n\n24:56.420 --> 24:58.340\n But we trained.\n\n24:58.340 --> 25:00.020\n We trained for a lot of situations.\n\n25:00.020 --> 25:03.580\n And we trained in real life atmospheres and whatnot.\n\n25:03.580 --> 25:06.420\n And this was just beyond that by leaps and bounds.\n\n25:06.420 --> 25:08.260\n It was bizarre.\n\n25:08.260 --> 25:10.220\n Did you see the towers collapse?\n\n25:10.220 --> 25:11.740\n As we were coming over the bridge,\n\n25:11.740 --> 25:15.660\n the first one, as we were deploying from the firehouse,\n\n25:15.660 --> 25:16.660\n we had a television on.\n\n25:16.660 --> 25:17.660\n And I saw it go down.\n\n25:21.540 --> 25:24.500\n And we were so involved in getting gear together\n\n25:24.500 --> 25:27.020\n and getting teams set up and, OK, you're\n\n25:27.020 --> 25:29.700\n going to be with these two guys.\n\n25:29.700 --> 25:31.380\n And I just yelled, there's the guys.\n\n25:31.380 --> 25:32.500\n And they're looking at me.\n\n25:32.500 --> 25:33.580\n I dropped to my knees.\n\n25:33.580 --> 25:34.540\n And I started praying.\n\n25:34.540 --> 25:36.020\n They're like, what the hell's wrong?\n\n25:36.020 --> 25:37.740\n I said, I couldn't even say.\n\n25:37.740 --> 25:40.500\n I was like, 114, they're in there.\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:41.500\n And they're like, what?\n\n25:41.500 --> 25:43.660\n I said, the tower's gone.\n\n25:43.660 --> 25:46.380\n And all you saw on the TV was just this pile of dust.\n\n25:46.380 --> 25:49.580\n And I guess because they didn't see it going down,\n\n25:49.580 --> 25:51.700\n they probably thought I truly lost it.\n\n25:51.700 --> 25:55.180\n And then the realization came.\n\n25:55.180 --> 25:57.620\n It was like, wow, the tower's down.\n\n25:57.620 --> 26:00.060\n So now it was like, wow, this is really on.\n\n26:00.060 --> 26:02.820\n So we just took off and got that boss.\n\n26:02.820 --> 26:10.980\n And so if you thought many of the guys on 114 were dead,\n\n26:10.980 --> 26:14.300\n if you thought that, did you think you were going to die?\n\n26:14.300 --> 26:19.180\n I mean, if you're rushing towards the rubble?\n\n26:19.180 --> 26:22.660\n As crazy as it sounds, I never thought that the other tower\n\n26:22.660 --> 26:23.500\n would go down.\n\n26:23.500 --> 26:27.260\n I said, OK, maybe some freak chance that one went down.\n\n26:27.260 --> 26:29.020\n But no, the other one's not going to go.\n\n26:29.020 --> 26:30.820\n They're built so strong.\n\n26:30.820 --> 26:32.580\n I was in those towers so many times.\n\n26:32.580 --> 26:35.140\n I mean, I ate dinner up in the top floor restaurant windows\n\n26:35.140 --> 26:35.780\n on the world.\n\n26:35.780 --> 26:38.500\n And I'm saying, nah, there's no way.\n\n26:38.500 --> 26:41.220\n Like, how the hell did this one happen?\n\n26:41.220 --> 26:45.180\n But I was having a hard time mentally processing\n\n26:45.180 --> 26:46.660\n that the building was gone.\n\n26:46.660 --> 26:51.540\n And believe me, if you don't have fear in this industry\n\n26:51.540 --> 26:55.860\n and police, fire, military, then you're kidding yourself\n\n26:55.860 --> 26:57.780\n or you're a danger to everyone.\n\n26:57.780 --> 27:00.220\n I don't care who it is, as tough as they are, this and that.\n\n27:00.220 --> 27:02.300\n Everybody has a certain level of fear\n\n27:02.300 --> 27:03.460\n with doing this.\n\n27:03.460 --> 27:06.020\n And I don't care how long you do it,\n\n27:06.020 --> 27:08.460\n there's always that chance of something going bad.\n\n27:08.460 --> 27:12.820\n And everyone who does it has that certain amount of fear.\n\n27:12.820 --> 27:16.340\n But at that point, it was such a feeling of disbelief\n\n27:16.340 --> 27:18.180\n that fear wasn't even kicking in.\n\n27:18.180 --> 27:20.700\n It was just like, what the hell just happened?\n\n27:20.700 --> 27:24.180\n And I honestly think it was almost like a shock.\n\n27:24.180 --> 27:27.300\n And it just stayed that whole day.\n\n27:27.300 --> 27:30.580\n So the building is, before it collapses, is burning.\n\n27:30.580 --> 27:31.300\n It's just burning.\n\n27:31.300 --> 27:35.180\n I mean, upper floors, up in the 78th, up to the 80s.\n\n27:35.180 --> 27:39.180\n And then the way that the cut was from the plane,\n\n27:39.180 --> 27:40.580\n it wasn't just straight across.\n\n27:40.580 --> 27:43.820\n It was from the 78th, then on up to maybe the 86th.\n\n27:43.820 --> 27:49.700\n And then the jet fuel had come down and was burning down.\n\n27:49.700 --> 27:51.940\n And there was people on the ground\n\n27:51.940 --> 27:56.500\n who were doused with jet fuel that was already burning.\n\n27:56.500 --> 27:59.020\n And they were lit on fire on the ground.\n\n27:59.020 --> 28:04.060\n It was just insane how vast the destruction path was.\n\n28:04.060 --> 28:06.860\n As a firefighter, what are you supposed\n\n28:06.860 --> 28:11.300\n to do with that scale of fire?\n\n28:11.300 --> 28:14.820\n I think the first bosses in, the first chiefs,\n\n28:14.820 --> 28:18.500\n were just going to do their best to get,\n\n28:18.500 --> 28:22.420\n as we get hose lines, what our whole theory is,\n\n28:22.420 --> 28:25.380\n or our tactics is, to get water at the fire,\n\n28:25.380 --> 28:28.700\n at the base of the fire, and get the truck company,\n\n28:28.700 --> 28:30.180\n which is the ladder company.\n\n28:30.180 --> 28:32.580\n They're the guys who break the doors down, put ladders up,\n\n28:32.580 --> 28:35.860\n this and that, to get them to where the life is most\n\n28:35.860 --> 28:38.380\n expected and get them out of there.\n\n28:38.380 --> 28:40.580\n So I think the chiefs tactics at that point\n\n28:40.580 --> 28:42.620\n was, let me get multiple engine companies.\n\n28:42.620 --> 28:45.180\n Let me get four, five, six hose lines\n\n28:45.180 --> 28:47.820\n fighting this fire, this massive fire.\n\n28:47.820 --> 28:51.460\n And let me get 15, 20 truck companies up there just\n\n28:51.460 --> 28:52.820\n yoking people out of there.\n\n28:52.820 --> 28:54.460\n Yeah, but you got to go up the stair.\n\n28:54.460 --> 28:55.860\n Everything's not working.\n\n28:55.860 --> 29:00.580\n Yeah, guys had to walk up 80, 80, 90, 100 flights of stairs.\n\n29:00.580 --> 29:05.580\n And there's audio of officers and firefighters\n\n29:06.340 --> 29:08.180\n speaking to each other on the radio channels.\n\n29:08.180 --> 29:09.780\n And unfortunately, at that point in time,\n\n29:09.780 --> 29:12.580\n we had very, very bad communication system.\n\n29:12.580 --> 29:14.700\n We'd been fighting for years to get radios\n\n29:14.700 --> 29:15.660\n that work properly.\n\n29:15.660 --> 29:18.460\n We couldn't because it was a lot of money.\n\n29:18.460 --> 29:21.300\n We fought for years to get the full bunker firefighting\n\n29:21.300 --> 29:23.700\n suits, which is the pants and the coat.\n\n29:23.700 --> 29:26.620\n We used to have just coats and these roll up rubber boots\n\n29:26.620 --> 29:29.700\n and guys were burning to death and we had to fight.\n\n29:29.700 --> 29:31.780\n And unfortunately we lost three guys\n\n29:31.780 --> 29:35.580\n in one vicious, vicious fire in 1994.\n\n29:35.580 --> 29:38.340\n And then they finally said, enough's enough.\n\n29:38.340 --> 29:40.380\n Give these guys the gear.\n\n29:40.380 --> 29:45.380\n So it's a strange phenomenon in the first responder world\n\n29:45.740 --> 29:47.780\n and in the military world.\n\n29:47.780 --> 29:49.820\n It's really one of the most important things\n\n29:49.820 --> 29:51.740\n that takes place in society.\n\n29:51.740 --> 29:54.660\n The most pertinent organizations.\n\n29:54.660 --> 29:56.660\n And we can't get the funding we need.\n\n29:56.660 --> 29:57.540\n It's crazy.\n\n29:57.540 --> 30:00.740\n They'll throw money at every nonsensical thing.\n\n30:00.740 --> 30:03.620\n But when it comes to gear, equipment,\n\n30:03.620 --> 30:08.220\n protective equipment, trucks, this couldn't get it.\n\n30:08.220 --> 30:10.140\n Just all the ways you could take care of people.\n\n30:10.140 --> 30:14.180\n I saw since 9 11, the wars in the Middle East\n\n30:14.180 --> 30:17.380\n have cost America over six trillion dollars.\n\n30:17.380 --> 30:20.660\n And the amount of that money that was spent\n\n30:20.660 --> 30:24.860\n on the soldiers, in this case the first responders,\n\n30:24.860 --> 30:25.860\n is minimal.\n\n30:25.860 --> 30:26.820\n Compared to it, yeah.\n\n30:26.820 --> 30:27.660\n Almost nothing.\n\n30:27.660 --> 30:30.860\n They, Lex, they closed down.\n\n30:30.860 --> 30:33.340\n I believe it's either seven or eight.\n\n30:33.340 --> 30:38.340\n In May of 2002, they closed down nine firehouses\n\n30:40.340 --> 30:42.740\n in New York City for budget reasons.\n\n30:42.740 --> 30:44.320\n We hadn't even finished cleaning up\n\n30:44.320 --> 30:48.260\n the World Trade Center site and they slashed the budget.\n\n30:48.260 --> 30:52.620\n And still to this day, have not reopened those firehouses.\n\n30:52.620 --> 30:55.100\n There's a million more people now living in New York City\n\n30:55.100 --> 30:57.500\n than there were in 2001.\n\n30:57.500 --> 31:00.780\n And the fire protection is way less than it was.\n\n31:00.780 --> 31:02.580\n And it's a sin.\n\n31:02.580 --> 31:03.700\n It's really a sin.\n\n31:03.700 --> 31:06.160\n Can I ask you a difficult question?\n\n31:07.180 --> 31:12.180\n So there's this famous photograph of a falling man.\n\n31:13.460 --> 31:17.560\n So many people had to decide when they're above the fire,\n\n31:17.560 --> 31:19.860\n in the fire, whether to jump out of the building\n\n31:19.860 --> 31:21.880\n or to burn to death.\n\n31:21.880 --> 31:23.740\n What do you make of that decision?\n\n31:23.740 --> 31:25.940\n What do you make of that situation?\n\n31:25.940 --> 31:28.500\n Those people who jumped,\n\n31:28.500 --> 31:31.420\n those were acts of sheer desperation.\n\n31:31.420 --> 31:36.100\n I've been in fires and just minor burns,\n\n31:36.100 --> 31:37.660\n but minor in situation.\n\n31:37.660 --> 31:39.940\n But I've been trapped, caught somewhat.\n\n31:39.940 --> 31:43.300\n Ended up in a burn center for nothing serious at all.\n\n31:43.300 --> 31:48.300\n But for those brief seconds, half a minute was,\n\n31:49.100 --> 31:51.300\n thank God, if I didn't have my fire gear on,\n\n31:51.300 --> 31:54.700\n I would have been burned to a very, very horrible level.\n\n31:54.700 --> 31:57.900\n Those people were burning alive.\n\n31:58.840 --> 32:01.500\n And they had the choice of either to stay there\n\n32:01.500 --> 32:05.900\n and burn alive or to launch themselves.\n\n32:05.900 --> 32:09.560\n And some of them, I don't fault them,\n\n32:09.560 --> 32:12.500\n but they had a few folks, they won't show it anymore\n\n32:12.500 --> 32:15.580\n because they say, I don't know why it offends some people,\n\n32:15.580 --> 32:18.980\n but they had a couple folks that took umbrellas\n\n32:18.980 --> 32:20.740\n and they took garbage bags\n\n32:20.740 --> 32:22.420\n because they thought that it would slow down\n\n32:22.420 --> 32:24.740\n their acceleration rate to the ground\n\n32:24.740 --> 32:27.900\n and maybe, just maybe they wouldn't be killed.\n\n32:27.900 --> 32:32.220\n And that's, to me, a true sense of desperation for humanity\n\n32:32.220 --> 32:34.840\n to say, I'm going to die either way,\n\n32:34.840 --> 32:36.900\n but let me take my chance.\n\n32:36.900 --> 32:39.860\n And I don't know the exact number of those folks\n\n32:39.860 --> 32:43.100\n who did that, but our first member of the fire department\n\n32:43.100 --> 32:47.080\n killed firefighter Daniel Serf, aged 216,\n\n32:47.080 --> 32:49.380\n was struck by a jumper.\n\n32:49.380 --> 32:54.380\n And one of my dear friends was ordered to help take him\n\n32:54.980 --> 32:56.640\n and they knew he was passed away\n\n32:56.640 --> 33:00.040\n because he was hit by a flying missile.\n\n33:00.040 --> 33:03.280\n I mean, 120 miles an hour, a body lands on you.\n\n33:03.280 --> 33:05.400\n Those two bodies are now crushed.\n\n33:06.280 --> 33:08.560\n And they were ordered to take that firefighter\n\n33:08.560 --> 33:11.700\n and bring him across the street to Engine 10, Ladder 10.\n\n33:11.700 --> 33:16.380\n It was literally a firehouse, less than 100 yards\n\n33:16.380 --> 33:18.180\n from the facade of the Trade Center,\n\n33:18.180 --> 33:19.940\n from the Trade Center complex.\n\n33:19.940 --> 33:22.300\n They were literally right there.\n\n33:22.300 --> 33:25.220\n And there was plane parts that went into that firehouse,\n\n33:25.220 --> 33:27.500\n landed into the front doors onto the roof,\n\n33:27.500 --> 33:30.140\n but the building itself was not destroyed.\n\n33:30.140 --> 33:33.980\n So it was used as a mini command center for quite a while.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.420\n So my friend was ordered to take Daniel's body\n\n33:37.420 --> 33:42.420\n in respect and bring it over to this firehouse\n\n33:43.640 --> 33:45.320\n and give it some semblance of dignity\n\n33:45.320 --> 33:47.500\n and lay it out on one of the bunk rooms,\n\n33:47.500 --> 33:49.360\n the bunks we have in the bunkhouse,\n\n33:50.440 --> 33:53.560\n and just cover it with a sheet and put a sign,\n\n33:53.560 --> 33:56.040\n please firefighter killed, do not disturb,\n\n33:56.040 --> 33:57.460\n and then we'll get to him later\n\n33:57.460 --> 34:01.040\n because obviously this operation is gonna go on for days.\n\n34:01.040 --> 34:03.320\n And my friend, who's such a great, wonderful guy,\n\n34:03.320 --> 34:06.960\n is so still to this day, filled with guilt\n\n34:06.960 --> 34:09.720\n because if they weren't taking his body out\n\n34:10.720 --> 34:12.400\n with the respect and dignity that they did,\n\n34:12.400 --> 34:16.240\n it took a while because it's a tough situation.\n\n34:17.320 --> 34:20.680\n His ladder company was coming over the bridge.\n\n34:20.680 --> 34:23.560\n There's a famous picture of Ladder 118.\n\n34:23.560 --> 34:26.080\n You see this tractor trailer fire truck.\n\n34:26.080 --> 34:29.360\n It's the one when the guy in the back also drives.\n\n34:29.360 --> 34:32.360\n And it's a zoomed out shot, and you see the Brooklyn Bridge,\n\n34:32.360 --> 34:35.000\n and you see only the fire truck in the middle,\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:38.240\n and you see the two burning towers in the distance.\n\n34:38.240 --> 34:41.040\n Well, his engine company was just ahead of them\n\n34:41.040 --> 34:44.840\n on the bridge, and the only reason that engine company lived\n\n34:44.840 --> 34:46.480\n is their initial duty assignment\n\n34:46.480 --> 34:49.600\n was to take that firefighter and bring his body over.\n\n34:49.600 --> 34:50.440\n It's like the military.\n\n34:50.440 --> 34:51.840\n We don't leave anyone behind.\n\n34:51.840 --> 34:53.260\n These are our guys.\n\n34:53.260 --> 34:56.160\n As some guys say, it's all about the guy right next to you,\n\n34:56.160 --> 34:58.200\n and nothing else really matters.\n\n34:58.200 --> 35:01.080\n When that guy right next to you goes down, it stops.\n\n35:01.080 --> 35:03.000\n You get that guy to safety,\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.640\n or if he's dead, you get him out.\n\n35:05.640 --> 35:10.080\n So in that time frame, that saved his life.\n\n35:10.080 --> 35:11.680\n But that's a heavy burden to carry now\n\n35:11.680 --> 35:12.880\n for the rest of your life,\n\n35:12.880 --> 35:15.280\n because you say, if I wasn't helping my dead friend,\n\n35:15.280 --> 35:16.360\n I'm dead.\n\n35:16.360 --> 35:17.200\n Yeah.\n\n35:18.480 --> 35:21.280\n What did it look like at Ground Zero?\n\n35:21.280 --> 35:22.580\n What did it feel like?\n\n35:22.580 --> 35:24.240\n What did it smell like?\n\n35:24.240 --> 35:27.160\n What, you said there was a sense\n\n35:27.160 --> 35:29.240\n that it was almost like a war zone,\n\n35:29.240 --> 35:33.760\n but can you paint a picture of how much dust is in the air?\n\n35:33.760 --> 35:35.240\n How hot is it?\n\n35:35.240 --> 35:36.900\n How many people are there?\n\n35:37.760 --> 35:40.460\n And again, how did it feel like?\n\n35:40.460 --> 35:45.160\n It was just, it was a scene of controlled chaos,\n\n35:45.160 --> 35:47.720\n controlled because there was a semblance of command,\n\n35:47.720 --> 35:50.120\n and we were just trying to do our jobs.\n\n35:51.040 --> 35:53.160\n But it was such a frantic pace\n\n35:53.160 --> 35:55.440\n because we're now digging frantically,\n\n35:55.440 --> 35:58.280\n knowing that there's life underneath this pile.\n\n35:58.280 --> 36:00.000\n And this is throughout the afternoon\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:01.520\n of that day, the evening.\n\n36:01.520 --> 36:03.360\n Yeah, I mean, this was nonstop,\n\n36:04.600 --> 36:06.980\n just nonstop, really, for days.\n\n36:06.980 --> 36:10.720\n But for my particular crew, we literally kept going.\n\n36:10.720 --> 36:14.080\n We initially were dispatched over towards number seven,\n\n36:14.080 --> 36:15.720\n had just gone down,\n\n36:15.720 --> 36:17.920\n and we were searching the post office that was there.\n\n36:17.920 --> 36:20.440\n There was reports of people trapped.\n\n36:20.440 --> 36:22.880\n And we painstakingly searched every single inch\n\n36:22.880 --> 36:25.480\n of that building to make sure no one was left in there.\n\n36:25.480 --> 36:28.160\n And then we were deployed to the pile,\n\n36:28.160 --> 36:30.160\n and the pile is sort of ambiguous\n\n36:30.160 --> 36:32.860\n because it was just such a vast, vast pile.\n\n36:32.860 --> 36:35.480\n I mean, it went for city blocks.\n\n36:35.480 --> 36:38.700\n And we were assisting in the retrieval\n\n36:38.700 --> 36:42.120\n of two Port Authority police officers.\n\n36:42.120 --> 36:45.000\n We're lucky enough to survive, but they were trapped.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.860\n They were deep down into a crevasse,\n\n36:46.860 --> 36:50.400\n and they had to be physically dug out and extricated.\n\n36:50.400 --> 36:53.500\n So there was a couple hundred, few hundred guys involved\n\n36:53.500 --> 36:56.100\n in that process of bringing in equipment,\n\n36:56.100 --> 36:59.360\n jaws of life, airbags to lift steel,\n\n36:59.360 --> 37:00.640\n to cut pieces of steel.\n\n37:00.640 --> 37:03.240\n It was just a huge operation.\n\n37:03.240 --> 37:05.840\n And we were back toward the logistics end of it,\n\n37:05.840 --> 37:09.360\n shuttling in gear and bringing in stretchers,\n\n37:09.360 --> 37:11.760\n bringing in oxygen, whatever was needed.\n\n37:11.760 --> 37:13.980\n And you were trying to climb over\n\n37:13.980 --> 37:16.620\n this jagged pile of debris.\n\n37:16.620 --> 37:18.680\n It wasn't like you just walked 100 feet\n\n37:18.680 --> 37:20.200\n on a street with something.\n\n37:20.200 --> 37:22.800\n You were trying to climb over this I beam\n\n37:22.800 --> 37:25.280\n and then down into this hole and then back up that hole.\n\n37:25.280 --> 37:27.460\n I mean, just to run one piece of equipment\n\n37:27.460 --> 37:32.200\n took a half an hour to get 100 feet, 200 feet.\n\n37:32.200 --> 37:34.000\n You know, mind you, some of these pieces of equipment\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.760\n are 100 pounds, you know, generator for hearse tools,\n\n37:36.760 --> 37:39.960\n this massive motor on a frame.\n\n37:39.960 --> 37:41.080\n Unstable ground.\n\n37:41.080 --> 37:44.000\n Unstable ground, just horrible conditions.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:47.240\n Fires were still burning aside you, beneath you.\n\n37:47.240 --> 37:51.000\n And at one point, I kind of veered off to the side\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:52.520\n and I was with this other fireman\n\n37:52.520 --> 37:55.360\n from my father's old ladder company, 172.\n\n37:55.360 --> 38:00.360\n And it was strange because we were quite a bit down,\n\n38:00.480 --> 38:03.580\n like 70 feet down into this ravine of debris.\n\n38:04.440 --> 38:06.880\n And he says, brother, what do you hear?\n\n38:06.880 --> 38:08.400\n And at the time it was like dust,\n\n38:08.400 --> 38:11.800\n it was like sand just falling down a pile\n\n38:11.800 --> 38:15.040\n and it was hissing from gas pipes and water pipes.\n\n38:15.040 --> 38:17.840\n And I said, I hear the gas lines,\n\n38:17.840 --> 38:20.360\n I hear the sand, I hear the concrete.\n\n38:20.360 --> 38:22.640\n He goes, no, no, what else do you hear?\n\n38:23.640 --> 38:26.560\n And just the side of us was a lady's pocketbook\n\n38:26.560 --> 38:29.520\n and a high heel shoe and someone's sneaker\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:32.060\n with nobody with it.\n\n38:33.820 --> 38:37.040\n And I said, I don't know, I don't hear anything.\n\n38:37.040 --> 38:37.960\n He says, me neither.\n\n38:37.960 --> 38:41.120\n He goes, no one's coming out of here.\n\n38:41.120 --> 38:42.320\n And I said, no, no, no,\n\n38:42.320 --> 38:44.040\n there's gotta be someone coming out of here.\n\n38:44.040 --> 38:45.680\n I mean, there's just thousands of people in here\n\n38:45.680 --> 38:47.480\n and they're coming out.\n\n38:47.480 --> 38:51.040\n He says, brother, we would hear them calling for help,\n\n38:51.040 --> 38:51.880\n they're gone.\n\n38:52.760 --> 38:55.880\n And I still at that point thought there was a chance.\n\n38:55.880 --> 38:59.400\n And after about the fourth day,\n\n38:59.400 --> 39:02.040\n they just said, this is a recovery now.\n\n39:02.040 --> 39:05.240\n There's no more life, there's no more chance.\n\n39:05.240 --> 39:07.320\n And then that first night we went full tilt\n\n39:07.320 --> 39:11.080\n till my crew, my specific crew of 12, 15 guys.\n\n39:11.080 --> 39:14.080\n And four in the morning, we just couldn't breathe anymore.\n\n39:14.080 --> 39:16.680\n We couldn't see, we were caked just with,\n\n39:16.680 --> 39:18.200\n it was like if you took flour\n\n39:18.200 --> 39:20.680\n and just kept dousing yourself.\n\n39:20.680 --> 39:22.560\n And the Lieutenant just said, look, guys,\n\n39:22.560 --> 39:25.120\n we're gonna go back, we're gonna get some medical aid\n\n39:25.120 --> 39:27.520\n and then we'll come back in a few hours.\n\n39:27.520 --> 39:32.520\n And we took a city bus back through the battery tunnel\n\n39:33.800 --> 39:37.060\n and unbeknownst to us that morning,\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:39.320\n this off duty firefighter,\n\n39:39.320 --> 39:41.560\n Steven Siller from Squad Company One,\n\n39:42.500 --> 39:44.920\n he raced down there with his pickup\n\n39:44.920 --> 39:47.560\n and he couldn't go any further\n\n39:47.560 --> 39:49.080\n because the traffic was stopped up\n\n39:49.080 --> 39:51.520\n because they had a report of a bomb.\n\n39:51.520 --> 39:55.920\n So everything was held up and he grabbed his fire gear\n\n39:55.920 --> 39:59.600\n and he put it on, stuff weighs about 60 pounds.\n\n39:59.600 --> 40:01.100\n And he ran through the tunnel.\n\n40:02.320 --> 40:05.600\n Two and a half miles, got to the end of the tunnel,\n\n40:05.600 --> 40:08.160\n fire truck was coming in from the other way.\n\n40:08.160 --> 40:11.060\n He hopped on the back, got him up to West Street,\n\n40:11.060 --> 40:14.120\n jumped off, tried to look for his company,\n\n40:14.120 --> 40:19.040\n where they were and he was never seen again.\n\n40:19.920 --> 40:21.400\n He just ran through the tunnel.\n\n40:21.400 --> 40:24.080\n Ran through the tunnel and he got there\n\n40:24.080 --> 40:26.040\n to help his team, right?\n\n40:26.040 --> 40:26.880\n It's all about the team,\n\n40:26.880 --> 40:28.880\n it's all about the guy right next to you.\n\n40:28.880 --> 40:31.040\n And he's the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, Steven.\n\n40:31.040 --> 40:35.760\n His brother Frank decided in his name in perpetuity,\n\n40:35.760 --> 40:39.160\n he's got a fund that now builds a home\n\n40:39.160 --> 40:41.280\n for every Gold Star family,\n\n40:41.280 --> 40:44.120\n for every seriously battle wounded warrior,\n\n40:44.120 --> 40:47.240\n for every seriously wounded first responder\n\n40:47.240 --> 40:49.720\n or killed in a line of duty first responder.\n\n40:49.720 --> 40:52.780\n If they had a home, they'll pay the mortgage.\n\n40:52.780 --> 40:56.080\n If they didn't have a home, they give them a home.\n\n40:56.080 --> 40:58.800\n And especially if it's a severely battle wounded,\n\n40:58.800 --> 41:00.000\n they give them a smart home\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:03.100\n because these poor guys come home with no limbs.\n\n41:03.100 --> 41:07.920\n And so the beauty of Steven and his selfless act\n\n41:07.920 --> 41:12.200\n was that he's now helped thousands and thousands of people.\n\n41:12.200 --> 41:14.040\n I mean, the Tunnel to Towers is incredible.\n\n41:14.040 --> 41:17.240\n That's part of our mission is to bring awareness\n\n41:17.240 --> 41:19.520\n to these great people at Tunnel to Towers, what they do.\n\n41:19.520 --> 41:24.520\n They've raised $250 million to help protect the protectors,\n\n41:25.480 --> 41:30.040\n to rescue the rescuers in a what's become, unfortunately,\n\n41:30.040 --> 41:33.120\n a somewhat ungrateful society.\n\n41:33.120 --> 41:37.200\n But they will not forget these great guys.\n\n41:37.200 --> 41:39.840\n So you tell Steven's story.\n\n41:39.840 --> 41:42.640\n He's one of the 20 people that you talk about\n\n41:42.640 --> 41:46.980\n in the new Iron Labs 20 for 20 podcast series.\n\n41:46.980 --> 41:50.420\n If you can just linger on his story a little longer,\n\n41:51.920 --> 41:54.120\n what does that tell you about the human spirit?\n\n41:54.120 --> 41:59.120\n That this guy, the Tunnel couldn't drive through,\n\n41:59.400 --> 42:03.160\n so he just puts on that heavy pack and runs.\n\n42:03.160 --> 42:04.360\n What do you make of that?\n\n42:04.360 --> 42:08.640\n That shows the depth of a man's soul.\n\n42:08.640 --> 42:10.240\n He didn't have to do that.\n\n42:10.240 --> 42:13.460\n He could have turned around and went home to his family,\n\n42:13.460 --> 42:15.160\n and nobody would have shamed him.\n\n42:16.220 --> 42:21.080\n But he's one of those beautiful, brave people\n\n42:21.080 --> 42:24.720\n that take a job that really doesn't pay a lot of money.\n\n42:25.600 --> 42:30.600\n And you become a cop or a firefighter or a nurse or an EMT\n\n42:30.600 --> 42:35.600\n or a medic or a soldier or a Marine or airman, sailor.\n\n42:36.200 --> 42:41.200\n When you take these jobs, you don't do it for fanfare.\n\n42:41.920 --> 42:43.840\n You definitely don't do it for money.\n\n42:43.840 --> 42:47.520\n I mean, those 13 brave souls we lost a week or two ago\n\n42:47.520 --> 42:51.240\n in Afghanistan, they're brand new soldiers and Marines.\n\n42:51.240 --> 42:54.120\n They make $22,000 an hour,\n\n42:54.120 --> 42:56.240\n but they don't work 40 hours a week.\n\n42:56.240 --> 42:58.440\n They work 80, they work 90 hours a week.\n\n42:58.440 --> 43:01.240\n So they make it about six bucks an hour.\n\n43:01.240 --> 43:02.080\n And you know what?\n\n43:02.080 --> 43:03.600\n They sign off.\n\n43:03.600 --> 43:07.680\n And firefighters and cops and medics and EMTs,\n\n43:07.680 --> 43:10.840\n nurses, emergency room doctors,\n\n43:10.840 --> 43:12.480\n they don't really make a lot of money.\n\n43:12.480 --> 43:14.980\n I mean, they're starting salary right now for a New York cop.\n\n43:14.980 --> 43:17.440\n I was a New York cop for two years first.\n\n43:17.440 --> 43:22.120\n I made 12.25 an hour back in 1989 to get shot at\n\n43:23.060 --> 43:24.960\n during the crack wars.\n\n43:24.960 --> 43:29.960\n If you made $11 an hour with a family of four,\n\n43:30.160 --> 43:32.160\n you were entitled to welfare back then.\n\n43:33.040 --> 43:38.040\n So I was just above the welfare level, risking my life.\n\n43:38.420 --> 43:41.480\n And these are the guys that are getting ripped up now.\n\n43:41.480 --> 43:42.320\n Right?\n\n43:42.320 --> 43:44.680\n And look, I won't get into any politics,\n\n43:44.680 --> 43:48.560\n but like that says something about someone's soul\n\n43:48.560 --> 43:50.640\n that they're willing to take a job like that\n\n43:50.640 --> 43:53.640\n and get now, get zero respect.\n\n43:53.640 --> 43:56.400\n So a guy like Steven, what that shows is the depth\n\n43:56.400 --> 43:59.600\n of that man's soul and courage and determination.\n\n44:00.840 --> 44:04.280\n It's hard to be selfless in this world anymore,\n\n44:04.280 --> 44:06.260\n but I still know a lot of selfless people\n\n44:06.260 --> 44:09.600\n that just put on equipment every day, bulletproof vests,\n\n44:09.600 --> 44:12.740\n fire bunker gear, stethoscopes,\n\n44:13.640 --> 44:17.440\n you know, flak jackets, military helmets,\n\n44:17.440 --> 44:19.800\n and they go in and they do it smiling.\n\n44:19.800 --> 44:23.680\n That young Marine that passed last week,\n\n44:23.680 --> 44:26.660\n she was photographed and quoted as saying,\n\n44:26.660 --> 44:28.080\n I have my dream job,\n\n44:28.080 --> 44:30.960\n but she was holding a little Afghani baby.\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:33.320\n And she was dead a few days later.\n\n44:33.320 --> 44:36.000\n She was so thrilled to be making $7 an hour\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:36.880\n helping people, right?\n\n44:36.880 --> 44:37.720\n Isn't that huge?\n\n44:37.720 --> 44:38.840\n Like that to me says,\n\n44:39.720 --> 44:42.440\n that's a true sign of character right there.\n\n44:42.440 --> 44:43.880\n And it's important for our society\n\n44:43.880 --> 44:46.120\n to elevate those people as heroes.\n\n44:46.120 --> 44:49.600\n Let me ask you about firefighting.\n\n44:50.480 --> 44:53.720\n What do you think it means to be a great firefighter\n\n44:53.720 --> 44:57.160\n and a great man, a great human being\n\n44:57.160 --> 45:00.040\n in a situation like you were in in 9 11?\n\n45:03.080 --> 45:06.040\n You know, that's kind of a broad term.\n\n45:06.040 --> 45:08.720\n Like some, you know, you can go to different firehouses\n\n45:08.720 --> 45:10.400\n and they might have a different definition\n\n45:10.400 --> 45:12.440\n of what they consider a great firefighter.\n\n45:12.440 --> 45:15.440\n But I think in the industry as a whole,\n\n45:15.440 --> 45:19.800\n if you're willing to put everyone else before you,\n\n45:19.800 --> 45:22.160\n especially your team, you know,\n\n45:22.160 --> 45:24.280\n as we say, there ain't no I in team, right?\n\n45:24.280 --> 45:26.400\n It's T E A M and there's no I in there.\n\n45:26.400 --> 45:29.800\n It's all about those guys and girls next to you.\n\n45:30.760 --> 45:34.520\n If you can do that, that makes you pretty great.\n\n45:34.520 --> 45:38.000\n You put everything else second and you just run in\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.600\n and you run in with that team for strangers.\n\n45:40.600 --> 45:43.680\n You know, I've had the honor of,\n\n45:43.680 --> 45:48.680\n I spent almost 25 years of my adult life serving humanity,\n\n45:48.680 --> 45:51.280\n my country, my former city.\n\n45:52.920 --> 45:55.880\n And the people I worked with were giants.\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:57.360\n And I don't mean that in height,\n\n45:57.360 --> 46:00.400\n I mean, but I mean that in spirit and in soul.\n\n46:00.400 --> 46:03.760\n I saw some of the most heroic, selfless acts.\n\n46:04.960 --> 46:06.960\n And then I saw some of the behind the scenes\n\n46:06.960 --> 46:08.040\n that were so impressive.\n\n46:08.040 --> 46:09.440\n You know, we'd go to the movies,\n\n46:09.440 --> 46:13.000\n so impressive, you know, we'd go to a fire around Christmas\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:14.840\n and the family would lose everything.\n\n46:16.120 --> 46:17.680\n And even when I was a cop, same thing,\n\n46:17.680 --> 46:19.600\n you'd come back either to the police precinct\n\n46:19.600 --> 46:21.720\n or the firehouse or the EMS station.\n\n46:23.080 --> 46:24.960\n And someone would put together a collection and say,\n\n46:24.960 --> 46:28.000\n hey guys, hey Lex, 50 bucks a man,\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:29.600\n you know, the Smith's down the street,\n\n46:29.600 --> 46:31.760\n just lost everything, we're gonna go get some presents\n\n46:31.760 --> 46:33.760\n for the kids and some turkeys.\n\n46:33.760 --> 46:36.960\n And not one of those guys questioned that.\n\n46:36.960 --> 46:39.200\n And they were making 12.25 an hour\n\n46:39.200 --> 46:42.280\n and they still came up with 50 bucks for that family.\n\n46:42.280 --> 46:45.280\n But see, that's the stuff the press won't show you, right?\n\n46:45.280 --> 46:49.240\n They don't wanna show that humanity, that soft edge.\n\n46:49.240 --> 46:51.000\n See, when you're a warrior, you need to have\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:54.360\n this rough shield, this rough exterior.\n\n46:54.360 --> 46:55.880\n Cause if you don't, you die.\n\n46:56.840 --> 47:01.840\n But a true great firefighter or responder or a cop\n\n47:02.440 --> 47:06.640\n or military personnel, they have that rough exterior\n\n47:06.640 --> 47:11.360\n with that soft underbelly, that heart, right?\n\n47:11.360 --> 47:14.520\n And that's, to me, the true great ones.\n\n47:14.520 --> 47:17.920\n Some of them, they just have a hard time doing that.\n\n47:17.920 --> 47:20.960\n There's no shame in showing your soft side.\n\n47:20.960 --> 47:23.400\n Well, you got your dad to say I love you back.\n\n47:23.400 --> 47:25.360\n No, that was huge, man.\n\n47:25.360 --> 47:28.360\n That took me 22 years, Lex.\n\n47:28.360 --> 47:31.760\n So you were a firefighter for 21, I was 22 years.\n\n47:31.760 --> 47:33.680\n Why did you become a firefighter?\n\n47:33.680 --> 47:36.760\n Oh, my dad, I mean, I was five years old\n\n47:36.760 --> 47:39.320\n and I went to his firehouse and there was these,\n\n47:39.320 --> 47:42.600\n at the time, they looked like giants to me with mustaches\n\n47:42.600 --> 47:47.520\n and the trucks smelled like smoke and the gear smelled\n\n47:47.520 --> 47:50.880\n like smoke and the tires and the diesel fuel\n\n47:50.880 --> 47:53.880\n and that one was like, this is what I'm gonna do.\n\n47:53.880 --> 47:55.800\n And then they bring you in the kitchen\n\n47:55.800 --> 47:58.760\n and they stuff you with ice cream and cake and everything.\n\n47:58.760 --> 48:02.560\n And then I go home to my mom, shaking with a sugar cone\n\n48:02.560 --> 48:04.760\n and she's mad at my dad, but yeah, it was just,\n\n48:04.760 --> 48:06.320\n oh, I was like, I gotta do this.\n\n48:06.320 --> 48:09.720\n It was like, they were like a baseball team in a garage\n\n48:09.720 --> 48:12.740\n with a truck and these big tools and big coats and helmets\n\n48:12.740 --> 48:14.720\n and they were just laughing and having fun\n\n48:14.720 --> 48:17.040\n and I'm like, yeah, man, I'm doing this.\n\n48:17.040 --> 48:19.480\n And I knew, I was obsessed with it.\n\n48:19.480 --> 48:22.280\n I mean, I was so pissed that the fireman's test came out\n\n48:22.280 --> 48:26.160\n when I was 14 and I couldn't take it, you had to be 18.\n\n48:26.160 --> 48:29.960\n And it was done, the test was graded and whatever.\n\n48:29.960 --> 48:32.800\n So my dad, now there's a copy circulating\n\n48:32.800 --> 48:34.560\n because it's old now.\n\n48:34.560 --> 48:37.260\n And he goes, yeah, yeah, this is what you're in for.\n\n48:37.260 --> 48:40.240\n And I took it and I did it like it was real\n\n48:40.240 --> 48:42.360\n and I got a 99 and I was so pissed.\n\n48:42.360 --> 48:43.680\n I said, I wanna get hired.\n\n48:43.680 --> 48:45.440\n He goes, you can't, you're 14.\n\n48:45.440 --> 48:49.000\n But I just wanted to do it so bad\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:50.800\n and I just wanted to help people.\n\n48:50.800 --> 48:53.680\n I just wanted to be like my dad,\n\n48:53.680 --> 48:56.400\n he'd come home smiling as tired as he was\n\n48:56.400 --> 48:58.560\n and he fought fires in the 60s and 70s\n\n48:58.560 --> 49:01.640\n when the city was burning and he's still\n\n49:01.640 --> 49:04.080\n as exhausted as he was, he'd still be smiling.\n\n49:05.320 --> 49:08.520\n I wanted to smile at work and I used to,\n\n49:08.520 --> 49:10.840\n I got paid to laugh and joke.\n\n49:10.840 --> 49:13.040\n I got paid to cry sometimes.\n\n49:13.040 --> 49:14.560\n But man, we laughed a lot.\n\n49:14.560 --> 49:17.120\n We really, it was, the chop breaking is just,\n\n49:17.120 --> 49:19.360\n it's just unending and it's great.\n\n49:19.360 --> 49:21.400\n If you don't mind, can you tell me,\n\n49:21.400 --> 49:23.460\n you were really kind enough to give me\n\n49:25.220 --> 49:27.760\n one of these shirts with 114.\n\n49:27.760 --> 49:31.160\n Can you tell me the story of 114 and Tally Ho?\n\n49:31.160 --> 49:34.240\n I wear proudly, I served eight years in that command\n\n49:34.240 --> 49:36.560\n and I didn't finish my career there.\n\n49:36.560 --> 49:38.720\n I passed the lieutenant's test\n\n49:38.720 --> 49:40.480\n and once you do, you have to leave.\n\n49:41.600 --> 49:46.280\n The story behind Tally Ho is back in World War II,\n\n49:46.280 --> 49:48.560\n there was this gentleman named Bad Jack Carroll\n\n49:48.560 --> 49:50.840\n and Jack was an airborne ranger\n\n49:50.840 --> 49:53.560\n and my father in law was also on the department\n\n49:53.560 --> 49:54.640\n and he knew Jack.\n\n49:54.640 --> 49:59.120\n And Jack came home, Jack jumped Normandy\n\n49:59.120 --> 50:02.440\n and stormed up through the Battle of the Bulls in Bastogne\n\n50:02.440 --> 50:07.440\n and he came back, greatest generation as they all did\n\n50:07.960 --> 50:10.280\n and they got jobs and they went right to work\n\n50:10.280 --> 50:14.780\n and they were treated better back then, vets, right?\n\n50:14.780 --> 50:16.960\n And he got on the New York City Fire Department\n\n50:16.960 --> 50:19.760\n and he got assigned a ladder 114\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:23.480\n and they first got radios back then\n\n50:23.480 --> 50:25.800\n and when Jack, he would drive the truck,\n\n50:25.800 --> 50:27.480\n you're up there with the officer,\n\n50:27.480 --> 50:28.860\n either the lieutenant or captain,\n\n50:28.860 --> 50:31.160\n so if the boss is off the truck,\n\n50:31.160 --> 50:33.720\n you operate the radio for them as the driver.\n\n50:33.720 --> 50:35.840\n So when they called him and they'd say,\n\n50:35.840 --> 50:38.460\n you know, ladder 114 responding to 52nd Street,\n\n50:38.460 --> 50:40.460\n 3rd Avenue, Structure Fire,\n\n50:40.460 --> 50:41.880\n you're supposed to get back and say,\n\n50:41.880 --> 50:44.760\n ladder 114, 10 four, but he refused to do that.\n\n50:44.760 --> 50:47.320\n He'd say, ladder 114, Tally Ho,\n\n50:47.320 --> 50:48.240\n because that's what they'd yell\n\n50:48.240 --> 50:50.200\n when they'd jump out the plane.\n\n50:50.200 --> 50:52.400\n So all these years later, it stuck\n\n50:52.400 --> 50:54.840\n and it's a little bit of a bragging right,\n\n50:54.840 --> 50:58.240\n but out of 350 engine and truck companies\n\n50:58.240 --> 51:00.320\n in the whole New York City Fire Department,\n\n51:00.320 --> 51:01.440\n we're pretty much the only one\n\n51:01.440 --> 51:03.520\n that's called by their nickname on the radio,\n\n51:03.520 --> 51:04.360\n not their number.\n\n51:04.360 --> 51:07.200\n So it tweaked some guys off in other places,\n\n51:07.200 --> 51:09.380\n you know, they may F you, Tally Ho,\n\n51:09.380 --> 51:13.320\n but it's just, yeah, it's a great, great heritage\n\n51:13.320 --> 51:17.520\n and we're really proud and Shamrock was,\n\n51:17.520 --> 51:20.760\n he was Irish and a lot of the guys back then\n\n51:20.760 --> 51:23.120\n were Irish immigrants from the area,\n\n51:23.120 --> 51:23.960\n from the neighborhood,\n\n51:23.960 --> 51:26.040\n and they would actually take the fire truck\n\n51:26.040 --> 51:28.360\n to church on Sunday and park out front\n\n51:28.360 --> 51:31.040\n and one guy would stay in it to hear the radio\n\n51:31.040 --> 51:32.240\n in case they got a call.\n\n51:32.240 --> 51:35.160\n So yeah, that's the proud history.\n\n51:35.160 --> 51:37.320\n And you said that if I wear this around New York,\n\n51:37.320 --> 51:38.280\n am I getting a little bit of?\n\n51:38.280 --> 51:39.600\n You might get a guy from the Bronx,\n\n51:39.600 --> 51:41.600\n go, hey, Tally Ho, screw you, you know?\n\n51:41.600 --> 51:44.640\n But I mean, it's all that good rivalry, you know?\n\n51:44.640 --> 51:47.960\n We like to, you know, we like to kid each other\n\n51:47.960 --> 51:51.400\n back and forth, you know, guys from Manhattan,\n\n51:51.400 --> 51:52.840\n we'll say, yeah, you guys are in Brooklyn,\n\n51:52.840 --> 51:54.840\n yeah, short buildings, tall stories.\n\n51:54.840 --> 51:56.760\n And they're like, yeah, you guys are in Manhattan,\n\n51:56.760 --> 51:59.360\n tall buildings, no stories, you know?\n\n51:59.360 --> 52:02.520\n Like it's just all that jocular ball break\n\n52:02.520 --> 52:04.760\n and it's good stuff, you know?\n\n52:04.760 --> 52:08.200\n Let me ask, I guess, a difficult question.\n\n52:08.200 --> 52:11.560\n If you just step back on the events of 9 11,\n\n52:11.560 --> 52:15.760\n on the side of the people that flew into the towers,\n\n52:15.760 --> 52:20.280\n what do you take away from that day about the nature,\n\n52:20.280 --> 52:23.760\n about human nature, about good and evil?\n\n52:23.760 --> 52:26.200\n How did that change your view of the world?\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:32.480\n I witnessed evil firsthand.\n\n52:32.480 --> 52:35.680\n I remember later on, well into that night\n\n52:35.680 --> 52:38.800\n when we were trying to help get those police officers out,\n\n52:38.800 --> 52:41.320\n I remember looking up at the building, Century 21,\n\n52:41.320 --> 52:45.680\n the store runs along the east side of the towers\n\n52:45.680 --> 52:48.360\n and it was still there and the debris had come down\n\n52:48.360 --> 52:50.040\n right almost to the edge.\n\n52:50.040 --> 52:53.120\n Century 21 is this old storied department store\n\n52:53.120 --> 52:56.360\n in New York City and the sign was there\n\n52:56.360 --> 52:59.600\n and it was still lit up, like some of the neon was broken\n\n52:59.600 --> 53:02.320\n but I think some of it was actually still lit up\n\n53:02.320 --> 53:05.080\n and I just looked around and I was like,\n\n53:05.080 --> 53:08.040\n this is a war zone, like we're at war.\n\n53:08.040 --> 53:11.320\n And we knew we were attacked, we heard the fighter planes\n\n53:11.320 --> 53:15.600\n and back then it wasn't the extensive communication\n\n53:15.600 --> 53:18.120\n network and we had cell phones but they were the old school\n\n53:18.120 --> 53:20.480\n flip phones and there was no news on them\n\n53:20.480 --> 53:24.560\n and so plus we didn't have signal down there anyway.\n\n53:24.560 --> 53:27.640\n I couldn't reach my family for like 12, 13 hours\n\n53:27.640 --> 53:31.120\n and my dad had deployed down to the ferry terminal\n\n53:31.120 --> 53:33.920\n to retrieve bodies.\n\n53:33.920 --> 53:37.720\n He was retired but he still went and they deployed him\n\n53:37.720 --> 53:41.520\n to go be basically the morgue transport guys.\n\n53:41.520 --> 53:44.840\n They expected to be sending hundreds and thousands\n\n53:44.840 --> 53:47.680\n of bodies across on the ferry and they set up\n\n53:47.680 --> 53:50.040\n these tractor trailers as a mobile morgue\n\n53:50.040 --> 53:53.680\n and that never happened because there were no bodies\n\n53:53.680 --> 53:55.440\n to take, they were all buried.\n\n53:58.400 --> 54:01.600\n So I saw evil firsthand, I don't know how someone\n\n54:01.600 --> 54:06.600\n can inflict such revenge or a vengeful act\n\n54:07.640 --> 54:10.680\n in the name of anything, in the name of a religion,\n\n54:10.680 --> 54:14.760\n in the name of a cause, in the name, like what the hell?\n\n54:14.760 --> 54:16.480\n Were you ever able to make sense of that,\n\n54:16.480 --> 54:19.080\n why men are able to commit such acts of terror\n\n54:19.080 --> 54:20.920\n in the days and the years after?\n\n54:22.320 --> 54:23.600\n No, Lex, I haven't.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:30.160\n My mom's from Ireland and I still have a lot of family there\n\n54:30.160 --> 54:35.160\n and my great uncles, one of them was dragged out and shot.\n\n54:35.800 --> 54:39.520\n He lived but just based on a rumor that he was in the IRA\n\n54:39.520 --> 54:44.520\n and I wasn't happy to see what happened to my mom's people\n\n54:44.720 --> 54:47.720\n because they were victimized and brutalized\n\n54:47.720 --> 54:50.800\n by England at that time.\n\n54:50.800 --> 54:55.680\n But blowing up bombs and killing innocents\n\n54:55.680 --> 54:58.920\n in the name of that, it doesn't make it right.\n\n55:00.080 --> 55:02.280\n I couldn't justify something like that.\n\n55:02.280 --> 55:07.280\n I can see, I was a cop, I was a soldier\n\n55:07.280 --> 55:12.280\n and you never wanna take life and those jobs\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:15.320\n but sometimes you have to.\n\n55:15.320 --> 55:16.920\n But you don't do it with a vengeance,\n\n55:16.920 --> 55:18.400\n you don't do it with a thirst,\n\n55:18.400 --> 55:21.440\n you do it because it's necessary for survival.\n\n55:22.560 --> 55:25.240\n When you do it out of a bloodlust, out of a thirst,\n\n55:25.240 --> 55:28.600\n out of a cause, that's evil, there's something wrong\n\n55:28.600 --> 55:33.600\n with you, I have no, I respect life to the highest level.\n\n55:33.600 --> 55:36.720\n I mean, I'm very, life is sacred to me, it's precious,\n\n55:36.720 --> 55:40.360\n it's beyond, it's not a commodity, it's a gift.\n\n55:42.520 --> 55:45.280\n But to take life just so randomly,\n\n55:45.280 --> 55:47.640\n so there's something way wrong with that person\n\n55:47.640 --> 55:50.320\n and maybe I'm a conflicted soul\n\n55:50.320 --> 55:53.320\n but I would have no problem seeing someone like that\n\n55:53.320 --> 55:56.400\n put to death because they do not deserve life.\n\n55:59.120 --> 56:02.440\n There's many children around me\n\n56:02.440 --> 56:04.480\n and many children around this world\n\n56:04.480 --> 56:07.080\n that are being taught to hate someone\n\n56:07.080 --> 56:10.840\n who's different than them just because the person\n\n56:10.840 --> 56:13.840\n who's allegedly teaching them says so.\n\n56:13.840 --> 56:14.840\n I don't understand it.\n\n56:14.840 --> 56:19.160\n Well, that starts with just having a basic respect\n\n56:19.160 --> 56:21.600\n and appreciation of other human beings\n\n56:21.600 --> 56:24.240\n and that starts with empathy.\n\n56:24.240 --> 56:27.600\n And one of the reasons I love this country,\n\n56:27.600 --> 56:31.120\n while joking that I'm Russian, maybe you could say the same\n\n56:31.120 --> 56:35.320\n as you being Irish, you're actually truly an American\n\n56:35.320 --> 56:37.920\n and that's why I consider myself very much an American.\n\n56:37.920 --> 56:40.360\n And one of the reasons I love this country\n\n56:40.360 --> 56:42.800\n is it serves as a beacon.\n\n56:42.800 --> 56:46.880\n I still believe it serves as a beacon of hope\n\n56:46.880 --> 56:50.280\n and that empathy and love for the rest of the world\n\n56:50.280 --> 56:54.040\n that hate is not gonna get you far,\n\n56:54.040 --> 56:55.680\n that love will get you a lot farther.\n\n56:55.680 --> 56:58.760\n And I still think sometimes it's easy\n\n56:58.760 --> 57:03.760\n to see the press, mainstream media,\n\n57:03.960 --> 57:05.880\n you could see social networks.\n\n57:05.880 --> 57:08.960\n Because you can make so much money on division,\n\n57:08.960 --> 57:11.960\n sometimes because it makes so much money,\n\n57:11.960 --> 57:14.720\n it's easy to think like we're really divided.\n\n57:14.720 --> 57:16.280\n I honestly don't think we are.\n\n57:16.280 --> 57:18.920\n That's just like the very surface level thing\n\n57:18.920 --> 57:20.160\n we see on Twitter and so on.\n\n57:20.160 --> 57:23.320\n It's that you're 100% right.\n\n57:23.320 --> 57:25.200\n There's people out there that are maximizing\n\n57:25.200 --> 57:27.960\n off this whole division, right?\n\n57:27.960 --> 57:30.720\n They want us divided, they want people angry\n\n57:30.720 --> 57:32.680\n because it sells.\n\n57:32.680 --> 57:34.880\n A lot of these people that are in charge\n\n57:34.880 --> 57:38.440\n of certain organizations, well, they all seem to have\n\n57:38.440 --> 57:42.120\n nice cars and nice houses and nice vacations\n\n57:42.120 --> 57:45.640\n and they're constantly trying to convince everybody\n\n57:45.640 --> 57:47.360\n that we hate each other.\n\n57:47.360 --> 57:49.360\n To me, I'll use a fireman analogy, right?\n\n57:49.360 --> 57:51.480\n It's like a little campfire.\n\n57:51.480 --> 57:55.880\n And if you just let the embers flutter, they'll go out.\n\n57:55.880 --> 57:58.560\n But if you take a little cup of gasoline with those embers,\n\n57:58.560 --> 58:01.760\n boom, it'll blow right up in your face.\n\n58:01.760 --> 58:04.280\n And that's what a lot of these politicians\n\n58:04.280 --> 58:06.520\n and a lot of these media folks are doing\n\n58:06.520 --> 58:08.680\n because there's something in it for them.\n\n58:08.680 --> 58:11.360\n And I think it's possible to defeat them\n\n58:11.360 --> 58:14.840\n with great leaders, with great spokespeople,\n\n58:14.840 --> 58:17.000\n with great human beings having a voice.\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.240\n One of the powerful things with the internet\n\n58:19.240 --> 58:21.960\n is more and more people have a voice.\n\n58:21.960 --> 58:25.480\n And I ultimately believe, certainly in America,\n\n58:25.480 --> 58:30.280\n but in the world, the good people outnumber the assholes.\n\n58:30.280 --> 58:31.120\n Oh, I agree.\n\n58:31.120 --> 58:33.200\n And there's days when I think the assholes\n\n58:33.200 --> 58:36.860\n are overrunning us, but you know what?\n\n58:38.080 --> 58:41.760\n I think what the downfall of the world is\n\n58:41.760 --> 58:45.760\n is ego and arrogance and people that think they're better\n\n58:45.760 --> 58:47.440\n than that other guy.\n\n58:47.440 --> 58:49.800\n My parents raised me to be this way.\n\n58:49.800 --> 58:52.120\n My mom is such a sweet, gentle soul.\n\n58:52.120 --> 58:52.960\n She's an immigrant.\n\n58:52.960 --> 58:55.040\n She came here at 16 years old.\n\n58:55.040 --> 58:57.680\n She helps everybody but herself, right?\n\n58:57.680 --> 58:59.040\n She's just one of those people.\n\n58:59.040 --> 58:59.880\n She's sick.\n\n58:59.880 --> 59:01.400\n She's got Parkinson's.\n\n59:01.400 --> 59:02.320\n You'd never know it.\n\n59:02.320 --> 59:04.920\n And she's still flying around her condo complex\n\n59:04.920 --> 59:08.040\n helping everybody because that's what she does.\n\n59:08.040 --> 59:10.440\n She loves to help people.\n\n59:10.440 --> 59:12.080\n But she's been in their shoes.\n\n59:12.080 --> 59:13.920\n She's been poor.\n\n59:13.920 --> 59:14.760\n She's sick.\n\n59:14.760 --> 59:15.720\n Her husband was sick.\n\n59:15.720 --> 59:19.640\n She's had all sorts of suffering and loss in her life.\n\n59:19.640 --> 59:23.120\n My granddad died when my mom was 10\n\n59:23.120 --> 59:27.320\n and she was one of 10 children that survived out of 14.\n\n59:27.320 --> 59:32.320\n She knows hard times, but she so appreciates the good times\n\n59:32.960 --> 59:34.860\n and the goodness of this country.\n\n59:35.720 --> 59:38.640\n You know, the fire department\n\n59:38.640 --> 59:40.200\n and the police department, military,\n\n59:40.200 --> 59:41.760\n it taught me a lot about empathy\n\n59:41.760 --> 59:43.920\n and trying to really feel for someone\n\n59:43.920 --> 59:48.000\n and put yourself in their situation.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.920\n I remember years back, I was a much younger fireman.\n\n59:50.920 --> 59:53.520\n I was probably five years on the job.\n\n59:53.520 --> 59:58.520\n And I was sent down to the next firehouse over to fill in.\n\n59:58.600 --> 1:00:00.320\n You know, we would get sent around randomly\n\n1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:02.100\n when they needed an extra guy.\n\n1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:06.840\n And someone came banging on the firehouse door\n\n1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:09.080\n and in the tenement apartment next door,\n\n1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:12.480\n they said there was an older woman that was unconscious.\n\n1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:14.840\n So we dispatched ourselves\n\n1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:17.120\n and we ran over with a medical kit\n\n1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:20.440\n and it was an elderly woman laying there on the bed.\n\n1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:23.640\n And she was obviously not breathing.\n\n1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:26.120\n She was obviously in cardiac arrest\n\n1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:29.360\n and an older gentleman that was holding her hand,\n\n1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:31.880\n just inconsolably crying.\n\n1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:34.080\n And it turned out it was her husband\n\n1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:37.040\n and they were married for 65 years.\n\n1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:40.760\n And normally we would just respectfully ask\n\n1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:43.300\n the family members to just step aside\n\n1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:45.120\n and let us do our work.\n\n1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:47.940\n And I realized that he wouldn't leave her side.\n\n1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:49.960\n So I kind of gave the crew a wink\n\n1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:53.600\n and they were doing CPR on what they had to.\n\n1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:57.000\n And I just let him keep holding her hand.\n\n1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:58.520\n And I said, sir, if you, you know,\n\n1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:02.220\n could you just come over just a little bit so we can work?\n\n1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:06.480\n And I held his hand as he held hers.\n\n1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:09.860\n And I said, sir, I said, do you have faith?\n\n1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:10.700\n And he did.\n\n1:01:10.700 --> 1:01:14.980\n And I said, would you like to pray with me for your wife?\n\n1:01:14.980 --> 1:01:17.300\n And he said, I would like to.\n\n1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:19.200\n So we said the Lord's prayer\n\n1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:23.140\n and you know, I just asked God to protect her and bless her.\n\n1:01:23.140 --> 1:01:27.240\n And I think he realized that she didn't have a chance,\n\n1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:30.960\n but we still gave her that chance.\n\n1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:32.540\n And we, you know, got her in the ambulance\n\n1:01:32.540 --> 1:01:35.640\n and maybe it was wrong to try to make it look\n\n1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:37.000\n like we could save her, but you know,\n\n1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.840\n you can't really not try.\n\n1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:44.800\n But the one beautiful moment was he thanked me\n\n1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:49.800\n and he was almost okay with it at that point.\n\n1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:51.040\n Like he wasn't as upset.\n\n1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:54.680\n He wasn't as distraught because I tried to just humanize\n\n1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:56.780\n that situation of what we were trying to do.\n\n1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:58.060\n We were trying to do our best,\n\n1:01:58.060 --> 1:02:01.760\n but we also tried to be compassionate to his sadness.\n\n1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:06.040\n And it just, I walked away just feeling so good,\n\n1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:07.920\n even though it was a tragic situation.\n\n1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:11.800\n And she did pass that, you know, he came by to, you know,\n\n1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:15.240\n thank us days later and just heartbreaking.\n\n1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:17.960\n But you know, there's just, it's just happens many,\n\n1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:21.000\n many times throughout the country every day.\n\n1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.480\n People get that opportunity as a responder to be\n\n1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:27.320\n that last bridge to the family and the loved one.\n\n1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:30.880\n And you only get that opportunity once sometimes\n\n1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:32.980\n and you really have to, to me,\n\n1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:34.260\n it's like your moment to shine.\n\n1:02:34.260 --> 1:02:35.520\n You know, you could just be very,\n\n1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:37.320\n very dismissive and very rude,\n\n1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:40.320\n or you could be compassionate and just show,\n\n1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:43.360\n hey, I have a mom, I have a grandma, I have, you know,\n\n1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:45.760\n and just in your mind, pretend that that's\n\n1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:47.520\n who you're working on and that's who you're with.\n\n1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:50.240\n So that moment of compassion, that moment of empathy,\n\n1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:54.160\n even if his brief can be the thing that saves the person\n\n1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:59.160\n from suffering, make the difference between suffering\n\n1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:01.920\n and overcoming in the face of tragedy.\n\n1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:05.080\n Yes, like I felt that even though obviously his loss\n\n1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:08.120\n was still huge, it just made it a little more bearable\n\n1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:11.240\n and, you know, tried to just take his grief down\n\n1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:14.880\n to a lower level and it made me feel,\n\n1:03:14.880 --> 1:03:17.000\n just feel really good about doing it.\n\n1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.760\n That's a powerful way to see the job of a first responder.\n\n1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:21.560\n Of course, you have to deal with certain aspects\n\n1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:24.240\n of the tragedy, but it's to provide somebody\n\n1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:26.920\n with that moment of compassion.\n\n1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:29.200\n Yeah, and you know, I made it a little habit\n\n1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:30.620\n because sometimes with faith,\n\n1:03:30.620 --> 1:03:32.260\n it's a little bit of a tricky subject.\n\n1:03:32.260 --> 1:03:35.440\n So every time I had someone who died,\n\n1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:37.640\n which unfortunately was many, many times,\n\n1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:40.240\n I would just touch their hand\n\n1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:42.080\n and just say a little quick prayer and just say,\n\n1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:44.960\n look, you know, I hope you're moving on to a better place.\n\n1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:49.960\n I hope if you did have faith that it's strong as you depart\n\n1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:51.280\n and if you didn't have faith,\n\n1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.720\n I hope maybe at your last moment that you found some\n\n1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:55.280\n and you just found some closure.\n\n1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:58.520\n So that was just my little ritual, I think.\n\n1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:01.240\n I just, you know, I felt it was important\n\n1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.760\n that that person, even though they were a stranger,\n\n1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:06.840\n just had someone there just sort of hoping\n\n1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:09.040\n for the best for them in their last moments.\n\n1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.640\n You mentioned cancer.\n\n1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:17.560\n You had a rare leukemia due to all the work\n\n1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:22.520\n that you did at Ground Zero.\n\n1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:25.900\n Can you maybe talk to the experience\n\n1:04:25.900 --> 1:04:28.960\n of just breathing through those days\n\n1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:32.300\n and what that was like, being unable to breathe,\n\n1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:37.300\n being overwhelmed by all of the dust in the air?\n\n1:04:37.300 --> 1:04:42.300\n Yes, the first day especially, we didn't have equipment.\n\n1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:45.780\n We didn't have breathing apparatus\n\n1:04:45.780 --> 1:04:49.160\n and then we were handed little 69 cent\n\n1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:50.880\n hardware store dust mask, you know,\n\n1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:52.160\n it was a little thin paint mask\n\n1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:54.580\n that would just get sweated up\n\n1:04:54.580 --> 1:04:57.520\n and sticking to your face within 30 seconds.\n\n1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:00.520\n So you would just, they were useless.\n\n1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:02.800\n And what you wound up feeling like was\n\n1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:05.160\n that you swallowed a box of razor blades\n\n1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:07.280\n because there was glass and there was cement\n\n1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:09.440\n and it was just so caustic.\n\n1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:12.480\n And I remember that night, you know,\n\n1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:15.520\n when we went back just to get some medical relief\n\n1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:18.960\n for the few hours, we were walking up the hill\n\n1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:20.880\n to the firehouse because they dropped us off\n\n1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:25.320\n like a block away down at Engine 201's quarters\n\n1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:29.400\n and one of the older firemen as we're walking up the block,\n\n1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:31.720\n we're all struggling, we're all having a hard time breathing\n\n1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:33.920\n and just, I mean, I felt like I was dying,\n\n1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:36.920\n literally, it was pretty bad.\n\n1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:39.020\n And I just remember the one guy going out,\n\n1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:39.860\n we're all dead.\n\n1:05:39.860 --> 1:05:41.420\n And I said, no, no, we made it, we made it.\n\n1:05:41.420 --> 1:05:42.680\n He goes, no, you don't get it, kid.\n\n1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:47.520\n He said, we just breathed in poison after poison for hours\n\n1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:50.800\n and then that went into days and then went into months.\n\n1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:54.120\n He says, we're all dead, man, this is gonna take us all.\n\n1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:58.160\n And I thought he was crazy and then now years later,\n\n1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:00.760\n like starting in 03 or 04,\n\n1:06:00.760 --> 1:06:04.160\n guys just started coming down with these really rare\n\n1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:08.440\n and advanced cancers and then it just stopped\n\n1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:11.280\n being a coincidence with the number of guys\n\n1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:14.640\n and they were young, one of the first guys, John McNamara,\n\n1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:18.940\n he was 33 or 34 and he came down colon cancer\n\n1:06:18.940 --> 1:06:23.580\n and it took him quickly in 2000, he was in 2005.\n\n1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:28.420\n And I kind of said to friends and family,\n\n1:06:28.420 --> 1:06:30.420\n I said, I feel like I'm running through a minefield\n\n1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:33.280\n and I wonder when I'm gonna step on my mind\n\n1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:35.940\n because everybody's gonna get sick.\n\n1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:39.440\n And I wasn't feeling well from 2008 on,\n\n1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:43.800\n I couldn't put my finger on it, but I just wasn't right.\n\n1:06:44.660 --> 1:06:49.500\n And in 2011, I failed my medical,\n\n1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:53.400\n my bloods came back horrifically wrong\n\n1:06:53.400 --> 1:06:55.600\n and they pulled me off the truck,\n\n1:06:55.600 --> 1:06:58.160\n but they strung me out for a month,\n\n1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:00.760\n the doctors in the fire department,\n\n1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.160\n one of them said my spleen was engorged\n\n1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.440\n because I was probably drinking myself to death,\n\n1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:10.280\n like as he said, most of the guys did after 9 11,\n\n1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:12.440\n which was pretty wrong of him and stereotypical,\n\n1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:14.880\n just to stereotype and to categorize\n\n1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:17.320\n and guy couldn't have cared less,\n\n1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:19.740\n he just, he was so crude and nasty.\n\n1:07:19.740 --> 1:07:23.240\n And then my one doctor who was my doctor on the outside,\n\n1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:26.320\n my blood pressure was 240 over 140,\n\n1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:28.800\n my spleen was about to rupture,\n\n1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:30.520\n she didn't even show up for my appointment\n\n1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:34.760\n and I went down, passed out, the paramedics responded,\n\n1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:36.680\n she got into an argument with a paramedic\n\n1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:40.120\n because for big ego and basically telling him\n\n1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:41.320\n there wasn't really anything wrong\n\n1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:43.380\n and he's looking at my paperwork going,\n\n1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:46.900\n this guy's got leukemia and he overrode her,\n\n1:07:46.900 --> 1:07:49.480\n he raced me out of there down to Brooklyn Methodist\n\n1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:54.480\n and the doctor, the charge physician, the ER physician,\n\n1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:58.920\n he says, you're not leaving, you're in a bad way.\n\n1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:00.920\n And I said, what is it?\n\n1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:04.500\n He said, I need a little while to figure it out,\n\n1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:09.200\n he goes, but you probably have one of a few different types\n\n1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:11.080\n of leukemia, he said, I'll drill into your hip,\n\n1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:13.520\n take your marrow and find out.\n\n1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:15.600\n And he said, but in the meantime,\n\n1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:17.320\n we'll get the swelling on the spleen down,\n\n1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:19.880\n I guess some sort of rapid medicines and whatnot\n\n1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:21.900\n because my spleen is about to rupture.\n\n1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:25.800\n I had no blood platelets left which is your clotter\n\n1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:27.880\n so I basically would have bled to death\n\n1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:31.440\n and I found out from my team of doctors\n\n1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:33.520\n that I had about 48 hours to live\n\n1:08:34.840 --> 1:08:37.040\n and that really set me off, I was infuriated\n\n1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:40.320\n because I was telling them for a long time that I was sick.\n\n1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:42.960\n The doctors failed you,\n\n1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:44.800\n the few doctors in the beginning failed you.\n\n1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:48.120\n I felt very betrayed and other guys had died\n\n1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:53.560\n and I had it out with that one doctor,\n\n1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:55.960\n I basically told her she was fired from my case\n\n1:08:55.960 --> 1:08:59.640\n and she's pretty politically in charge person\n\n1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:02.700\n and I didn't care, I jeopardized my job for it\n\n1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:04.800\n because it was my life and I got the sense\n\n1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:07.720\n that it didn't really matter to her.\n\n1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:09.960\n She didn't have any empathy, as you say.\n\n1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:13.920\n It was exact, so why for her, why for a few others,\n\n1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:18.920\n was there not a special care, a special compassion\n\n1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:20.880\n for, first of all, all humans,\n\n1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:22.960\n but human beings in your position,\n\n1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:26.000\n especially a firefighter, a first responder?\n\n1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.760\n You know, Alex, I think what it is in the department,\n\n1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:31.300\n their title is just to get us back to duty\n\n1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:35.700\n as quickly as possible when we are either injured or sick\n\n1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:38.680\n because what happens then is your replacement\n\n1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:43.200\n is now in overtime so you're out being paid on medical leave\n\n1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:45.160\n but then they need to replace your spot\n\n1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:47.140\n and then that costs more money.\n\n1:09:47.140 --> 1:09:49.560\n So I think it just behooves them\n\n1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:52.460\n to get as many personnel back\n\n1:09:52.460 --> 1:09:54.360\n and especially during the summertime,\n\n1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:57.000\n they look at it like, oh, maybe you want a few extra days off\n\n1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.000\n to go to the beach and this one doctor,\n\n1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:04.680\n he tipped his hand back as if I was drinking\n\n1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:07.600\n an alcohol beverage, he says, hey, busy summer?\n\n1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:09.360\n Because I asked him to look at my spleen\n\n1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:13.000\n which was sticking out of my abdomen like a football\n\n1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.640\n and I said, excuse me, sir, I said,\n\n1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:18.000\n how dare you assume that I'm abusing alcohol\n\n1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.240\n because alcohol abuse sometimes will present itself\n\n1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:26.160\n as the spleen is engorged and having an issue.\n\n1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:29.060\n So he automatically just assumed that that was my situation,\n\n1:10:29.060 --> 1:10:32.840\n wouldn't even give me an exam and I was horrified.\n\n1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:35.680\n I was so angry, I mean, I wanted to punch this guy out\n\n1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:37.240\n and I literally was screaming at him\n\n1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:41.160\n and an executive officer came in to diffuse it\n\n1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:42.640\n and sent me to another doctor\n\n1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:44.840\n and when I showed her my paperwork, she was horrified.\n\n1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:47.120\n She was like, what did he say?\n\n1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:50.280\n And she said, oh, okay, go to your regular doctor tomorrow\n\n1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:52.160\n who was one of the department doctors\n\n1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:55.520\n and it was just an indifference.\n\n1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.200\n It was like, I don't know,\n\n1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:00.800\n I was shocked at the lack of compassion\n\n1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:04.120\n but you know what, that being said, I'm past it,\n\n1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:05.120\n life moves on.\n\n1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:09.780\n The team of doctors, I ended up with a Methodist\n\n1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:13.960\n and my subsequent oncologist, Dr. Peter Menzel,\n\n1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:16.760\n world class, just incredible human being.\n\n1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:18.840\n My Dr. Pete is just, I love him.\n\n1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:21.180\n I just, I love him like a friend, like a big brother,\n\n1:11:21.180 --> 1:11:25.640\n like a father, like my primary oncology care nurse,\n\n1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:28.200\n Mike Nunez, was just an incredible human being\n\n1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:30.000\n and he knew I was frightened\n\n1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.720\n because I had to get two and a half years of chemo\n\n1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:37.240\n compressed into seven days or I was dead.\n\n1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:40.680\n And these massive bags of chemo that never stopped\n\n1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:45.680\n and they burned, the minute they went into your body,\n\n1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:47.600\n you felt like you were burning to death\n\n1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:49.280\n from the inside out.\n\n1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:51.880\n And Mike, when Mike came in to hook me up,\n\n1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:54.920\n he said, look, I have to wear a hazmat suit.\n\n1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:57.720\n This stuff is so caustic that if it drips,\n\n1:11:57.720 --> 1:11:59.960\n it'll burn whenever it touches.\n\n1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:02.400\n And I was like, but Mike, you're gonna put that in my body.\n\n1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:04.640\n How the hell is it not gonna kill me?\n\n1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:07.120\n He says, no, no, this is exactly what it's supposed to do.\n\n1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:08.440\n Trust me.\n\n1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:11.540\n So when he prepped the IV tube to get it flowing,\n\n1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:13.000\n it spilled onto the tube\n\n1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.600\n and the tube started to smoke and burn.\n\n1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:18.160\n And I said, no effing way, Mike,\n\n1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:19.240\n you're not putting that in me.\n\n1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:20.760\n No way, no way.\n\n1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:22.440\n And he goes, listen, let me get another one.\n\n1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:23.640\n Let me start it over.\n\n1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:25.600\n And here he is wearing a hazmat suit, looking at me\n\n1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:27.920\n and I'm going, this is insane.\n\n1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:30.400\n And he goes, he looked at me, he took my hand\n\n1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:33.100\n and he says, Nels, if you don't take it, you're dead.\n\n1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.980\n He says, you got those three kids.\n\n1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:37.800\n I'm sorry, I have no other option.\n\n1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:38.960\n You're dead.\n\n1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:41.080\n And I said, all right, Mike, okay.\n\n1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:42.560\n And he hooked me up.\n\n1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:45.320\n And you know what, it was like, you know,\n\n1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:47.980\n if you do drink alcohol and you have like a shot\n\n1:12:47.980 --> 1:12:50.880\n or want, you know, strong type spirit\n\n1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:53.140\n and you start feeling that burn.\n\n1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:56.320\n Well, the minute he hit me in the vein,\n\n1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.800\n it just started going up my arm, burning\n\n1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:03.440\n and then up my shoulder, across my neck, into my head,\n\n1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:04.680\n across the rest of my body,\n\n1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:06.640\n within a minute down to my feet.\n\n1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:08.920\n And I was writhing in pain for seven days\n\n1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:11.180\n and I was praying to die.\n\n1:13:12.220 --> 1:13:14.480\n I was the seventh rescuer in six months\n\n1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:17.120\n to come down with the rarest leukemia there is.\n\n1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:20.440\n There's only 500 cases in all of North America a year.\n\n1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.560\n And seven of us came down in six months.\n\n1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:24.440\n Two guys died during treatment.\n\n1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:26.240\n Seven responders, police, fire.\n\n1:13:27.780 --> 1:13:29.880\n Two guys died in the first couple of days of the treatment\n\n1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:32.240\n because it's so vicious, your liver, your heart,\n\n1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:35.040\n your kidneys, something will fail.\n\n1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:37.520\n And I was praying and I was praying, but I wanted to die.\n\n1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:39.480\n I was in so much pain.\n\n1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:40.880\n And I wouldn't take a painkiller\n\n1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:42.920\n because I know people with some issues\n\n1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:45.200\n and I just didn't want to go there.\n\n1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:48.480\n And finally on the last day I gave in,\n\n1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:50.480\n I said, please, I can't do this anymore.\n\n1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:53.460\n I was literally like jumping out of my skin\n\n1:13:53.460 --> 1:13:55.640\n and they gave me something.\n\n1:13:55.640 --> 1:13:58.100\n But it had burned out my mind, it burned out my body.\n\n1:13:58.100 --> 1:14:01.100\n I couldn't hear, I could barely see, it was vicious.\n\n1:14:01.100 --> 1:14:03.580\n But it worked.\n\n1:14:03.580 --> 1:14:05.740\n And my nurses especially,\n\n1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:08.380\n they just, they were so dedicated and devoted.\n\n1:14:08.380 --> 1:14:10.340\n And I was not an easy patient\n\n1:14:10.340 --> 1:14:11.780\n because I was in a lot of pain.\n\n1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:16.380\n It was bad and it was, drove my friends, my family crazy.\n\n1:14:16.380 --> 1:14:17.900\n It was just, it wasn't good.\n\n1:14:18.860 --> 1:14:22.580\n But on that first night I had a quick vision\n\n1:14:22.580 --> 1:14:26.740\n of all these people that I loved that were dead, that died.\n\n1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:28.860\n A lot of them in a trade center and I saw Johnny,\n\n1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:31.380\n I saw friends I grew up with.\n\n1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:34.460\n The last one was my mother in law\n\n1:14:34.460 --> 1:14:37.500\n who had passed six months before and she died of,\n\n1:14:37.500 --> 1:14:39.460\n she was in a coma, she had a stroke.\n\n1:14:39.460 --> 1:14:42.500\n She had a horrible, horrible last six months of life\n\n1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:45.380\n and it wasn't fair because she was so religious.\n\n1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:49.020\n She went to church every day, devout Catholic woman.\n\n1:14:49.020 --> 1:14:51.100\n And all of a sudden I see her and she's smiling\n\n1:14:51.100 --> 1:14:55.300\n and we used to talk a lot, it's the Irish thing,\n\n1:14:55.300 --> 1:14:56.860\n like the gab, the gift of gab.\n\n1:14:56.860 --> 1:14:59.100\n And she used to call me her boyfriend\n\n1:14:59.100 --> 1:15:00.620\n because we'd sit and talk for hours\n\n1:15:00.620 --> 1:15:03.700\n and talk about books and about movies and about food.\n\n1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:05.400\n I loved her, she was my friend.\n\n1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:08.860\n And she'd say, you know, my boyfriend's here.\n\n1:15:08.860 --> 1:15:10.260\n And all of a sudden she's smiling\n\n1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:11.620\n and she goes, hi, my boyfriend.\n\n1:15:11.620 --> 1:15:13.860\n And I says, Nan, Nan, what are you doing?\n\n1:15:13.860 --> 1:15:16.860\n She goes, he's not ready, he doesn't want you.\n\n1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:19.420\n You gotta go back, you got things to do.\n\n1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:21.500\n And I'm like, no, Nan, Nan, it hurts so much.\n\n1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:23.260\n Please, please take me and she left.\n\n1:15:23.260 --> 1:15:26.140\n She goes, no, no, not yet, I'll see you.\n\n1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:27.480\n And she just faded away.\n\n1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:30.340\n And one of my doctors on my team,\n\n1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:35.340\n she had a problem with religion.\n\n1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:38.140\n And that's okay, I understand that.\n\n1:15:38.140 --> 1:15:40.380\n I'm not a preacher, I have a faith,\n\n1:15:40.380 --> 1:15:41.920\n but I don't preach it, I don't push it.\n\n1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:44.940\n I just live and let live.\n\n1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:47.340\n So she sent in this shrink to see me.\n\n1:15:47.340 --> 1:15:49.940\n And I was messed up from the chemo,\n\n1:15:49.940 --> 1:15:53.340\n but I knew what I was seeing, I knew what I was saying.\n\n1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:56.340\n And he was a Jewish gentleman.\n\n1:15:56.340 --> 1:15:59.420\n He was a rabbi also in a synagogue.\n\n1:15:59.420 --> 1:16:01.380\n And I actually had responded in that district\n\n1:16:01.380 --> 1:16:04.700\n and he knew 114 would run into Borough Park.\n\n1:16:04.700 --> 1:16:08.060\n Oh yeah, I see Tyler, oh, they come down the street.\n\n1:16:08.060 --> 1:16:11.300\n And he asked me to tell him the story and I did.\n\n1:16:11.300 --> 1:16:14.140\n And he started laughing and he scared me now.\n\n1:16:14.140 --> 1:16:15.900\n I says, Doc, am I really crazy?\n\n1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:17.820\n He said, no, no.\n\n1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:19.940\n He said, I believe you, my friend.\n\n1:16:19.940 --> 1:16:23.180\n He said, we share the same God.\n\n1:16:23.180 --> 1:16:25.820\n He goes, we work in the same corporation,\n\n1:16:25.820 --> 1:16:27.700\n but in different departments.\n\n1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:30.660\n And he says, you did see your mother in law.\n\n1:16:30.660 --> 1:16:32.700\n He says, your faith is that strong.\n\n1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:33.980\n He said, I've had many patients\n\n1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:35.860\n express the same sentiments.\n\n1:16:35.860 --> 1:16:38.500\n He said, so I want you to listen to her\n\n1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:40.000\n and fight and be strong.\n\n1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:42.700\n And he said, so what else do you want to talk about?\n\n1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:44.740\n I said, well, I don't know, Doc, am I that messed up?\n\n1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:45.560\n He goes, no, no.\n\n1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:46.740\n He goes, they're paying me for an hour.\n\n1:16:46.740 --> 1:16:48.180\n It only took 20 minutes.\n\n1:16:48.180 --> 1:16:51.180\n So we watched the Yankee game together and that's less.\n\n1:16:51.180 --> 1:16:53.740\n But it was just, again, it showed the human condition.\n\n1:16:53.740 --> 1:16:57.300\n Here's these two men of two totally different faiths.\n\n1:16:57.300 --> 1:17:00.780\n And yet we shared that bond of faith.\n\n1:17:00.780 --> 1:17:03.340\n And he had empathy and he had sympathy.\n\n1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:08.340\n And he saw me in many other patients.\n\n1:17:08.540 --> 1:17:10.020\n So he just didn't assume.\n\n1:17:10.020 --> 1:17:11.860\n And he gave me a fair shake\n\n1:17:11.860 --> 1:17:14.620\n and I will always be grateful to him for that.\n\n1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:18.260\n Through any of this, the pain you had to go through\n\n1:17:18.260 --> 1:17:21.940\n with the leukemia, but also the days of 9 11\n\n1:17:21.940 --> 1:17:24.760\n and after, did your faith get challenged?\n\n1:17:26.060 --> 1:17:28.620\n You know, Lex, it was strange.\n\n1:17:28.620 --> 1:17:30.140\n It was times I was so angry.\n\n1:17:30.140 --> 1:17:31.860\n You know, there's that range of emotions,\n\n1:17:31.860 --> 1:17:36.140\n the anger, the denial, the depression, the this, the that.\n\n1:17:36.140 --> 1:17:37.300\n And this is the weirdest thing.\n\n1:17:37.300 --> 1:17:41.500\n It was mostly, I knew my career was over\n\n1:17:41.500 --> 1:17:43.700\n and they retired me out of the job.\n\n1:17:43.700 --> 1:17:46.700\n That, I got sick in August and that October,\n\n1:17:46.700 --> 1:17:48.580\n they told me I was out.\n\n1:17:48.580 --> 1:17:51.700\n And by the time I was processed and, you know,\n\n1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:54.980\n used up my leaves and whatever you want to say it was,\n\n1:17:54.980 --> 1:17:58.300\n I was officially retired in January of 02\n\n1:17:59.420 --> 1:18:01.980\n and it was less than six months.\n\n1:18:01.980 --> 1:18:03.820\n And I'm there walking my dog one day,\n\n1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:05.580\n my rescued Greyhound who I miss.\n\n1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:06.860\n She was such a soul.\n\n1:18:06.860 --> 1:18:09.020\n God, she lived to be almost 13, Katie.\n\n1:18:09.020 --> 1:18:12.220\n And we were walking in the snow and I got the call.\n\n1:18:12.220 --> 1:18:14.000\n I was retired and I looked at her and I'm like,\n\n1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:15.180\n Katie, what am I going to do?\n\n1:18:15.180 --> 1:18:16.740\n She just looked up and said, we're going to go\n\n1:18:16.740 --> 1:18:18.700\n on a lot more walks, you know?\n\n1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:22.580\n And I was so sad and I was so sad and I was so angry\n\n1:18:22.580 --> 1:18:24.060\n because I lost my priesthood.\n\n1:18:24.060 --> 1:18:25.180\n I loved helping people.\n\n1:18:25.180 --> 1:18:28.140\n I really, like I would have done it for free.\n\n1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:30.900\n I would never tell Mayor Bloomberg that, right?\n\n1:18:30.900 --> 1:18:32.180\n He's all about the buck, right?\n\n1:18:32.180 --> 1:18:33.380\n But like, you know, honestly,\n\n1:18:33.380 --> 1:18:35.180\n I would have been a New York City fireman.\n\n1:18:35.180 --> 1:18:37.660\n I would have paid them to do it, you know?\n\n1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:40.500\n And I wasn't allowed anymore.\n\n1:18:40.500 --> 1:18:41.340\n That's it.\n\n1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:43.660\n You have over 20 years and you have cancer.\n\n1:18:43.660 --> 1:18:45.020\n You know, back when my dad got sick,\n\n1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:47.780\n they'd let you hang around for 10, 12 years in an office,\n\n1:18:47.780 --> 1:18:49.140\n but not now.\n\n1:18:49.140 --> 1:18:50.940\n Now it's all about the bottom line.\n\n1:18:53.220 --> 1:18:55.580\n But I was more depressed about losing a job\n\n1:18:55.580 --> 1:18:57.220\n than almost losing my life.\n\n1:18:57.220 --> 1:18:59.200\n Like, as crazy as that sounds, you know?\n\n1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:00.860\n And it just...\n\n1:19:00.860 --> 1:19:01.940\n It was more than a job.\n\n1:19:01.940 --> 1:19:04.260\n I mean, it's a way of life.\n\n1:19:04.260 --> 1:19:05.100\n Oh, man, yeah.\n\n1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:07.460\n It also is your family, your father,\n\n1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:10.540\n your carrying torture, your father's...\n\n1:19:10.540 --> 1:19:11.360\n Oh, my friend.\n\n1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:12.200\n I love my friends.\n\n1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:14.420\n I love, we worked 24 hour shifts together.\n\n1:19:14.420 --> 1:19:17.300\n You cook, you clean, you break each other's jobs\n\n1:19:17.300 --> 1:19:18.140\n relentlessly.\n\n1:19:18.140 --> 1:19:20.920\n I mean, I love those guys so much.\n\n1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:24.420\n I mean, I hope that my kids\n\n1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:25.960\n and anyone that I know and care about,\n\n1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:30.960\n I hope they can experience the bond of that brotherhood\n\n1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:32.740\n that I experienced in my life.\n\n1:19:32.740 --> 1:19:33.580\n It was so...\n\n1:19:33.580 --> 1:19:36.140\n God, I would give anything to have it back.\n\n1:19:36.140 --> 1:19:37.580\n Just, yeah.\n\n1:19:37.580 --> 1:19:39.260\n Can I ask you about New York?\n\n1:19:39.260 --> 1:19:42.260\n So unfortunately, I've never lived in New York.\n\n1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:43.100\n I visit.\n\n1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:44.860\n I've always wanted to live there for a bit.\n\n1:19:44.860 --> 1:19:47.020\n Obviously, it's a very different experience\n\n1:19:47.020 --> 1:19:50.280\n to have really lived in New York for many, many years.\n\n1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:54.700\n But there's a few friends of mine that are from...\n\n1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:56.620\n They got similar accent as yours.\n\n1:19:56.620 --> 1:19:57.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:57.460 --> 1:20:00.660\n That are a little bit saddened.\n\n1:20:00.660 --> 1:20:03.900\n Perhaps it's temporary, but perhaps not.\n\n1:20:03.900 --> 1:20:07.180\n They don't seem to think so of what New York has become,\n\n1:20:07.180 --> 1:20:08.660\n especially with COVID.\n\n1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:12.300\n It's losing some of the spirit of New York.\n\n1:20:12.300 --> 1:20:13.560\n Do you have that sense?\n\n1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:15.640\n Do you have a hope for the city\n\n1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:19.520\n that has been so defining to what is America?\n\n1:20:21.060 --> 1:20:22.700\n My heart's broken.\n\n1:20:22.700 --> 1:20:25.620\n I had moved to New Jersey many years ago,\n\n1:20:25.620 --> 1:20:27.660\n but I still have a close attachment to New York.\n\n1:20:27.660 --> 1:20:30.940\n My parents are still there, many, many family members.\n\n1:20:32.340 --> 1:20:34.300\n And I've since now moved to Tennessee.\n\n1:20:34.300 --> 1:20:36.780\n I needed to go somewhere quiet.\n\n1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:38.860\n I wanted to heal my fractured soul.\n\n1:20:38.860 --> 1:20:43.860\n And I'm in the middle of a beautiful farming rural area\n\n1:20:43.860 --> 1:20:45.060\n in middle Tennessee.\n\n1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:48.740\n And so they probably called me a sellout\n\n1:20:48.740 --> 1:20:50.020\n back in New York for leaving,\n\n1:20:50.020 --> 1:20:52.900\n but it's not the same city and it's sad.\n\n1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:58.320\n I'll refrain from the politics and the finger pointing,\n\n1:20:59.340 --> 1:21:01.580\n but it's a mess compared to what it was.\n\n1:21:01.580 --> 1:21:06.180\n And I did Broadway theater security for many years,\n\n1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:09.060\n and I started to see it slide\n\n1:21:09.060 --> 1:21:11.860\n like with stuff that was happening,\n\n1:21:11.860 --> 1:21:15.340\n like public urination and defecation\n\n1:21:15.340 --> 1:21:18.820\n and just like tourists don't wanna see that, right?\n\n1:21:18.820 --> 1:21:23.820\n And I had an unfortunate incident two years ago.\n\n1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:27.740\n I was jumped by four teenagers coming off the subway\n\n1:21:28.780 --> 1:21:29.900\n and they were pissed off\n\n1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:31.860\n because I was wearing an American flag hat.\n\n1:21:31.860 --> 1:21:36.100\n And I don't know, I'm not really sure why,\n\n1:21:36.100 --> 1:21:40.120\n but it left me, I got out of it, okay.\n\n1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:43.200\n But I was taken back.\n\n1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:44.600\n They were literally videoing it\n\n1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:47.300\n and the kid was just throwing shadow punches at my face\n\n1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:48.220\n wanting to beat me up.\n\n1:21:48.220 --> 1:21:50.080\n And I finally looked him in the eyes and I was like,\n\n1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:52.900\n oh boy, I'm a little too old for this.\n\n1:21:52.900 --> 1:21:54.620\n Body's a little broken down for chemo.\n\n1:21:54.620 --> 1:21:56.860\n And I finally just said, all right, all right.\n\n1:21:56.860 --> 1:21:59.260\n I just had enough, I wanted to go home.\n\n1:21:59.260 --> 1:22:02.580\n Just worked a 17 hour shift as a stage hand.\n\n1:22:02.580 --> 1:22:04.660\n And I was so taken back, I was so insulted.\n\n1:22:04.660 --> 1:22:07.980\n I'm saying, I spent my life protecting this city\n\n1:22:07.980 --> 1:22:10.660\n and now I'm getting attacked like for nothing.\n\n1:22:10.660 --> 1:22:12.220\n And I just, I gave up\n\n1:22:12.220 --> 1:22:14.460\n and maybe I should have given it a little more time,\n\n1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:19.140\n but it's, I don't know, it's turned into an angry place.\n\n1:22:19.140 --> 1:22:22.820\n It's turned into, I think there's a lot of people\n\n1:22:22.820 --> 1:22:26.180\n that aren't getting the resources they need in a sense.\n\n1:22:26.180 --> 1:22:27.580\n There's a lot of mental illness.\n\n1:22:27.580 --> 1:22:29.380\n There's a lot of homelessness.\n\n1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:31.360\n There's a lot of violent people\n\n1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:33.940\n just roaming around the streets and it's not good.\n\n1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:35.420\n It's not safe.\n\n1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:38.900\n And tourists are not gonna come back.\n\n1:22:38.900 --> 1:22:40.580\n Even just leading up to the COVID,\n\n1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:43.180\n I had some tourists saying to me, I won't be back.\n\n1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:44.660\n And now I can only imagine\n\n1:22:44.660 --> 1:22:46.580\n that it's just gotten exponentially worse,\n\n1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:49.220\n but I hope there's a chance it'll swing back.\n\n1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:50.980\n Cause it is, it's the gateway to the world.\n\n1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:55.580\n I mean, my grandfather came from Denmark.\n\n1:22:55.580 --> 1:22:58.140\n He landed in Ellis Island in the twenties.\n\n1:22:59.140 --> 1:23:01.900\n American success story, 25 bucks in his pocket,\n\n1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:03.940\n didn't speak the language,\n\n1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:06.860\n had a sponsor family in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.\n\n1:23:06.860 --> 1:23:09.300\n And he made it, you know, he ended up dying\n\n1:23:09.300 --> 1:23:13.020\n owning a bakery at one point and then an apartment building.\n\n1:23:13.020 --> 1:23:14.500\n And he did pretty well for himself\n\n1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.960\n for an immigrant who was poor.\n\n1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:20.420\n And my mom, my Irish mother landed in the same neighborhood,\n\n1:23:20.420 --> 1:23:24.060\n Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 16 years old.\n\n1:23:24.060 --> 1:23:27.540\n Worked as a cashier 50, 60 hours a week in the supermarket\n\n1:23:27.540 --> 1:23:29.040\n and finished school at night.\n\n1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:32.760\n Married my father, the fireman,\n\n1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:36.000\n and, you know, lived the American dream.\n\n1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.800\n And it was all, it was all from New York.\n\n1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:40.640\n And my father's mom was from Irish immigrants\n\n1:23:41.540 --> 1:23:43.520\n and they all landed in Ellis Island.\n\n1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:45.960\n Well, my mom didn't cause it was closed at that point,\n\n1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:49.800\n but it's, there's people breaking down the doors\n\n1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:51.640\n to come to this country, right?\n\n1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:55.160\n There's no one breaking down the doors to leave.\n\n1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:56.600\n And this is, this is a problem I have\n\n1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:58.740\n with people that aren't grateful for being here.\n\n1:23:58.740 --> 1:24:00.480\n And this, again, it's not political,\n\n1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:03.440\n just straight down the middle fastball.\n\n1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:06.600\n If you don't like it here, I'll show you the door.\n\n1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:08.460\n I'll get you the plane ticket.\n\n1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:10.560\n I mean, would you want to live back in Russia\n\n1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:11.440\n compared to here?\n\n1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:13.600\n Would you, you might because of family ties,\n\n1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:16.120\n but I mean, if you had no ties to Russia\n\n1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:18.040\n or would you want to go to China right now\n\n1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:21.280\n and possibly end up in a labor camp or, right?\n\n1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:24.320\n There's people busting down the doors to get to this place.\n\n1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:25.540\n It's not perfect.\n\n1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:29.440\n It's got its flaws, it's got its blemishes, you know,\n\n1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:32.560\n but it's a damn great place.\n\n1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:34.360\n It's the best country in the world.\n\n1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:36.320\n Yeah, and some of it, so first of all,\n\n1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:37.540\n I have hope for New York.\n\n1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:40.880\n I think that culture is very difficult to kill.\n\n1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:42.920\n I think it will persevere.\n\n1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:45.400\n And I think ultimately the same story with New York\n\n1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:48.080\n as with the rest of the United States,\n\n1:24:48.080 --> 1:24:49.720\n it has to do with leaders.\n\n1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:53.320\n And I'm always hopeful that great leaders will emerge.\n\n1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:54.160\n I agree.\n\n1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:58.000\n And the kind of leadership we see now\n\n1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.720\n and the kind of conversations we have now,\n\n1:24:59.720 --> 1:25:04.440\n I think it has to do with the prosperity and comfort.\n\n1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:06.080\n And in the face of hardship,\n\n1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:07.680\n I think great leaders will emerge.\n\n1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:11.160\n And yeah, I just think ultimately\n\n1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:13.400\n in the long arc of history.\n\n1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:15.200\n Well, leaders shouldn't become rich.\n\n1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:17.280\n They shouldn't become rich in the process, right?\n\n1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:20.040\n You shouldn't go into political office\n\n1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:23.720\n as an alleged lunchbox kind of guy\n\n1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:26.840\n and then come out eating at the best steakhouse in the world.\n\n1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:30.120\n I mean, that's the problem with politics, right?\n\n1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:33.140\n My Irish grandmother, God rest her, used to say,\n\n1:25:33.140 --> 1:25:35.540\n oh, those politicians, they're all like dirty diapers.\n\n1:25:35.540 --> 1:25:37.520\n They're full of shit and they stink.\n\n1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:38.360\n And it's true.\n\n1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:40.280\n I don't give a crap what party they're in.\n\n1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:41.560\n Yeah, greed and power.\n\n1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:42.880\n We had to beg these guys,\n\n1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:45.800\n beg them for federal legislation\n\n1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:47.840\n to cover our medical bills, right?\n\n1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:49.240\n There's a gentleman, John Field\n\n1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:51.300\n from the Feel Good Foundation.\n\n1:25:51.300 --> 1:25:54.280\n This guy is a lion of a man, a general,\n\n1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:57.320\n but with a soft, big, great heart.\n\n1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:00.840\n And John is a former construction worker\n\n1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:05.120\n who came to the 9.11 site the day after.\n\n1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:08.440\n He was one of those guys cutting the steel with torches\n\n1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:09.920\n and craning it out of the air.\n\n1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:12.520\n One of those hard hats that just,\n\n1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:16.860\n that never got the credit and the praise\n\n1:26:16.860 --> 1:26:18.880\n that we did as responders.\n\n1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:21.560\n And I don't mean that as a knock to responders, right?\n\n1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:25.640\n I mean, we lost 37 Port Authority police officers,\n\n1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:27.660\n 23 NYPD officers,\n\n1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:33.040\n about a dozen emergency medical technicians and paramedics,\n\n1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:36.400\n three court officers from New York State courts\n\n1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:38.280\n and two federal agents,\n\n1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:41.200\n and I hope, and 343 New York City firefighters.\n\n1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:43.660\n We lost a ton of responders.\n\n1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:46.400\n But the recovery workers,\n\n1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.800\n thankfully weren't killed in that process,\n\n1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:53.360\n but there's hundreds of them now who are dead from illnesses\n\n1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:55.860\n because they came down to recover our people\n\n1:26:55.860 --> 1:26:58.380\n and the civilians and the poor lost souls\n\n1:26:58.380 --> 1:27:01.080\n that were killed at work that day.\n\n1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:05.040\n And John literally almost lost his foot\n\n1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:07.400\n in a construction accident at the site.\n\n1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:12.400\n An 8,000 pound I beam tore off half of his foot,\n\n1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:16.200\n ended up with massive sepsis, six months in the hospital,\n\n1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:19.540\n hundreds of thousand dollars in medical bills,\n\n1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:21.840\n and then no one wanted to pay him.\n\n1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:23.480\n So here's a guy, he's gonna lose his house,\n\n1:27:23.480 --> 1:27:25.620\n lose his life, lose everything.\n\n1:27:25.620 --> 1:27:29.520\n And now the never forget, it started quick, right?\n\n1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:33.000\n And he went on a mission,\n\n1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.200\n formed his Feel Good Foundation.\n\n1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:38.160\n His last name is Feel, F E A L, Feel Good Foundation.\n\n1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:43.160\n And this man literally went to Washington, DC\n\n1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:45.420\n with his army, as he called it.\n\n1:27:45.420 --> 1:27:47.520\n And I was honored and blessed to be with him\n\n1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:48.720\n a couple, only a couple times.\n\n1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:51.680\n I wish I had dedicated some more time to it.\n\n1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:56.320\n And what it was with John is he set out on a mission\n\n1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:59.440\n to get, and initially what he did is he got funding\n\n1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:02.280\n to take care of responders who were in that limbo,\n\n1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:04.000\n who couldn't get their medical bills paid,\n\n1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:05.320\n who couldn't make their mortgages,\n\n1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:07.180\n who couldn't make their car payments,\n\n1:28:07.180 --> 1:28:09.760\n who couldn't make their childcare payments.\n\n1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:12.080\n And John just took it upon his own to get donations\n\n1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:14.920\n and take care of you while you were suffering, right?\n\n1:28:14.920 --> 1:28:16.640\n I got a call when I got out of hospital.\n\n1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:17.480\n You okay?\n\n1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:18.300\n You need anything?\n\n1:28:18.300 --> 1:28:19.200\n I said, who is this?\n\n1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:20.520\n It's John Feel.\n\n1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:22.240\n I said, aren't you that constructor?\n\n1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:23.840\n Yeah, you need anything?\n\n1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:25.160\n I'm pretty good right now.\n\n1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:26.600\n I said, I appreciate it.\n\n1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:27.960\n Phone ring again a few weeks later.\n\n1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:29.920\n Hey, John Feel, you need anything?\n\n1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:31.880\n I'm like, this guy's incredible.\n\n1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:33.400\n But there's people who needed stuff\n\n1:28:33.400 --> 1:28:35.040\n and he was getting it done.\n\n1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:38.960\n And he, with his army, had to chase these politicians\n\n1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:40.800\n through the halls of Congress\n\n1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:44.200\n to get funding to cover the medical bills.\n\n1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:46.420\n I was getting sued for $125,000\n\n1:28:46.420 --> 1:28:48.840\n for my month stay in the cancer ward.\n\n1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:52.400\n And I couldn't believe it.\n\n1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:53.920\n I said, well, wait a minute, I have insurance.\n\n1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:56.540\n They're like, oh, no, no, this is terrorism related.\n\n1:28:56.540 --> 1:28:57.920\n We don't cover that.\n\n1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:00.020\n So usually then workers comp will cover\n\n1:29:00.020 --> 1:29:01.960\n your on duty injury or illness.\n\n1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.460\n Oh, no, no, no, leukemia is not covered under that.\n\n1:29:04.460 --> 1:29:05.800\n We don't cover that.\n\n1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:08.220\n So then the ping pong game starts\n\n1:29:08.220 --> 1:29:10.520\n and I'm literally have people showing up,\n\n1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:13.400\n taking pictures of my kids in front of the house.\n\n1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:15.480\n And I went and grabbed the guy one day by the collar.\n\n1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:16.720\n So who the hell are you?\n\n1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:18.800\n Sir, I'm a private investigator.\n\n1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:20.280\n We're putting a lien on this property\n\n1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:21.920\n due to a nonpayment of a bill.\n\n1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:23.520\n I said, okay, I understand.\n\n1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:24.400\n Do your job.\n\n1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:25.800\n Let me bring my kids inside.\n\n1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:27.280\n Take all the pictures you want.\n\n1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:28.700\n Don't step on my front lawn.\n\n1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:31.480\n And I went in the house.\n\n1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:36.540\n I closed my room, my door, my door, my room, and I cried.\n\n1:29:36.540 --> 1:29:38.200\n I said, I can't believe this.\n\n1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:42.000\n I spent my entire adult life trying to help people,\n\n1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:45.920\n give of myself, and I can't even get my medical bill paid.\n\n1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:48.200\n Well, John Field got my medical bill paid.\n\n1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:51.400\n He finally got these politicians with his team,\n\n1:29:51.400 --> 1:29:54.240\n firefighter Ray Pfeiffer, who has since died,\n\n1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:59.240\n fought with terminal cancer for nine years in a wheelchair.\n\n1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:01.800\n Literally at the end, came out of hospice\n\n1:30:01.800 --> 1:30:05.360\n to go finalize getting us this coverage.\n\n1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:11.160\n Detective Luis Alvarez, who testified days before he died\n\n1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:15.640\n in front of Congress, and a bunch of other guys\n\n1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:17.360\n that were really, really sick,\n\n1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:19.960\n and we had to shame these people into signing on.\n\n1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:22.120\n And luckily we had John Stewart come on\n\n1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:25.040\n and literally just hound these guys\n\n1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:27.320\n and shame them and embarrass them.\n\n1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:31.440\n And what it all stemmed from was in 2006,\n\n1:30:31.440 --> 1:30:35.960\n the first death that was determined to be linked to 9 11,\n\n1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:36.800\n there was others,\n\n1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:39.260\n but the first one that was officially linked\n\n1:30:39.260 --> 1:30:42.240\n was a New York City police detective who initially,\n\n1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:44.660\n the city said he died of advanced lung disease.\n\n1:30:44.660 --> 1:30:47.200\n His lungs were protruding out of his body.\n\n1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:49.960\n And he was on painkillers and it was so bad at the end\n\n1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:52.920\n that the doctor said, just grind them up, snort them,\n\n1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:56.000\n drink it, whatever you need to do to get instant relief.\n\n1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:57.720\n So when they found the talcum\n\n1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:00.020\n from the pill lining in his lungs,\n\n1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:02.440\n they said, oh no, this is opiate abuse.\n\n1:31:02.440 --> 1:31:04.200\n He didn't die of lung disease.\n\n1:31:04.200 --> 1:31:07.160\n So they said, and the mayor was quoted as saying,\n\n1:31:07.160 --> 1:31:08.940\n he is not a hero.\n\n1:31:08.940 --> 1:31:10.960\n Well, shame on you, Mr. Mayor.\n\n1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:12.600\n He was a hero.\n\n1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:15.720\n And his father, who was a retired police chief,\n\n1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:18.060\n married up with the Feel Good Foundation\n\n1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:22.180\n and John Stewart and Ray Pfeiffer, Detective Alvarez.\n\n1:31:23.420 --> 1:31:25.320\n And they got us all covered.\n\n1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:26.920\n But it took so long.\n\n1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:28.180\n Like it was so heartbreaking.\n\n1:31:28.180 --> 1:31:32.000\n These people who were lining up three deep politicians,\n\n1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.400\n three deep to catch a picture with a responder\n\n1:31:34.400 --> 1:31:37.040\n so they can tweet, hashtag never forget\n\n1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:40.400\n and hashtag look at me and hey, how am I doing?\n\n1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:41.520\n All that bull crap.\n\n1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:43.960\n They were nowhere to be freaking found.\n\n1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:48.080\n I literally witnessed them hiding in cloak rooms,\n\n1:31:48.080 --> 1:31:51.120\n running down hallways away from us, those freaking cowards.\n\n1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:52.560\n That's cowardice.\n\n1:31:52.560 --> 1:31:54.600\n Can I just linger on the John Stewart thing,\n\n1:31:54.600 --> 1:31:56.640\n the comedian, actor, John Stewart,\n\n1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:00.320\n his testimony before Congress over the benefits\n\n1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:02.560\n for 9 11 first responders.\n\n1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:05.480\n I mean, there's a lot of important human beings\n\n1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.920\n in the story, but he has a big voice.\n\n1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:10.320\n And he spoke from the heart.\n\n1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:12.600\n What do you make of that testimony?\n\n1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:13.720\n Oh, it was heartfelt.\n\n1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:16.200\n I mean, he spoke.\n\n1:32:16.200 --> 1:32:20.920\n Look, I mean, John was a polarizing guy, right?\n\n1:32:20.920 --> 1:32:22.560\n There's certain things like over the years,\n\n1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:24.680\n he was cutting edge and I might not have agreed\n\n1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:28.360\n with all of his, you know, some stuff, some not, right?\n\n1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:30.120\n You know, like we all, but I tell you,\n\n1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:31.040\n I found him as funny.\n\n1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:33.240\n I enjoyed his humor.\n\n1:32:33.240 --> 1:32:35.000\n I would love the two of you to have a conversation.\n\n1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.760\n No, but again, I love a guy where you can have,\n\n1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:39.240\n you can have a difference in opinions.\n\n1:32:39.240 --> 1:32:41.080\n That's the beautiful thing about the firehouse kitchen.\n\n1:32:41.080 --> 1:32:44.080\n I mean, it could get raucous and now, I don't know,\n\n1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:45.680\n it's a little different situation,\n\n1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:48.600\n but I mean, back in the day, some funny stuff.\n\n1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:52.120\n But yeah, John, John literally just took his talents.\n\n1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:54.480\n You would think he was speaking from the heart\n\n1:32:54.480 --> 1:32:57.400\n of a fireman or a cop or a soldier or a Marine,\n\n1:32:57.400 --> 1:32:59.000\n you know, someone who was there.\n\n1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:04.880\n But I think he especially got to know Ray so well\n\n1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:09.160\n and Ray had this stack of mask cards from, you know,\n\n1:33:09.160 --> 1:33:11.560\n the funeral cards they give out.\n\n1:33:11.560 --> 1:33:13.600\n It looks like, you know, a larger business card\n\n1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:15.240\n that's laminated.\n\n1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:18.080\n And Ray had a stack of them he would carry around.\n\n1:33:18.080 --> 1:33:20.040\n I think it was close to a hundred cards\n\n1:33:21.360 --> 1:33:23.880\n and John saw it and he said, what's that?\n\n1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:25.240\n He says, these are my cards.\n\n1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:26.120\n He said, for what?\n\n1:33:26.120 --> 1:33:28.560\n He says, for my brother's funerals.\n\n1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:32.040\n He was like, oh my God, you've been to that many funerals?\n\n1:33:32.040 --> 1:33:35.880\n He goes, yeah, this is just the ones I made.\n\n1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:39.720\n Like, you know, and John, I think was just stunned.\n\n1:33:41.320 --> 1:33:44.040\n And John actually had that stack of cards\n\n1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:48.040\n after Ray passed and like said, look, look at these.\n\n1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:50.080\n There's gonna be more of these cards.\n\n1:33:50.080 --> 1:33:52.320\n We have one guy a week or girl,\n\n1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:55.320\n one responder or a recovery worker\n\n1:33:55.320 --> 1:33:58.240\n or someone who actually resided down there.\n\n1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:00.800\n There's more than one a week dying.\n\n1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:04.000\n It's one a day dying on average.\n\n1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.240\n And on average, two people are diagnosed\n\n1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:09.280\n with a 9 11 cancer or disease.\n\n1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:11.080\n Right now, the worst part is\n\n1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:14.720\n there's autoimmune diseases flying off the graph\n\n1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:17.440\n and they're not covered under the legislation.\n\n1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:19.440\n By the grace of God, my cancer is covered.\n\n1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:22.520\n If my cancer comes back, I mean, I'm in remission.\n\n1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:25.320\n It's technically incurable, but I've been blessed\n\n1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:28.360\n I'm staying ahead of this stuff going on 10 years.\n\n1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:31.960\n But if it comes back with a vengeance tomorrow and takes me,\n\n1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:33.800\n at least my wife will get my pension\n\n1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:36.640\n and be able to live her life without fear.\n\n1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:38.400\n But my friends who are suffering\n\n1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:41.600\n from these advanced autoimmunes, their wives get nothing.\n\n1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:43.560\n Their pension dies with them.\n\n1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:47.600\n And we're hoping that John and his army\n\n1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:51.480\n can shame these politicians once again\n\n1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:55.600\n to have the kindness and decency to cover these autoimmunes.\n\n1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:58.160\n You know, they're throwing a lot of money around\n\n1:34:58.160 --> 1:34:59.520\n at a lot of things lately.\n\n1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:03.060\n And this is one that they won't.\n\n1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:05.800\n And these are lives in the balance who really need it.\n\n1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:08.140\n And John had this strong line.\n\n1:35:08.140 --> 1:35:12.880\n They did their jobs, do yours, talking to the politicians.\n\n1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:13.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:17.320\n And it's a strong wake up call\n\n1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:21.760\n that it's not about the Twitter or the social media\n\n1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:23.280\n or all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.280\n You have a job to do and you have to,\n\n1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:30.960\n it's that compassion implemented in the form of money\n\n1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:33.860\n of helping people that were there for you\n\n1:35:33.860 --> 1:35:35.400\n when you needed help.\n\n1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:36.760\n Well, we had a guy, I mean,\n\n1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:38.960\n I might get audited out of this one, I hope not,\n\n1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:41.560\n but we had a Congressman from out West,\n\n1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:44.600\n I won't say where, but he prided himself on saying\n\n1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:49.400\n he was a retired cop, a busy cop, 22 years.\n\n1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:52.280\n He said no on the legislation.\n\n1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:56.160\n I witnessed a cop who was dying get out of his wheelchair\n\n1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:00.080\n and said, hey brother, I got a half a million dollars\n\n1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:02.240\n in medical bills and I'm a short timer.\n\n1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:03.720\n I got a few months to live.\n\n1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:06.000\n Who the F is gonna pay him?\n\n1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:07.000\n Do the right thing.\n\n1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.440\n You say you're a cop, you show me you're a cop\n\n1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:11.240\n and you sign that paper.\n\n1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:13.480\n And the guy started tearing up the Congressman\n\n1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:16.120\n and he signed it, but he had to be freaking shamed.\n\n1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:17.120\n And you know what he said?\n\n1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:18.900\n Well, this doesn't really confront me.\n\n1:36:18.900 --> 1:36:21.440\n This is pork as far as my district is concerned.\n\n1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:23.520\n He goes, oh yeah, do you know there's 10 guys\n\n1:36:23.520 --> 1:36:25.400\n from your district who came across the country\n\n1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:27.240\n to help us that are also dying?\n\n1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:28.800\n He had no idea.\n\n1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:30.120\n He had no idea.\n\n1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:32.000\n And that's the sad part about Alex.\n\n1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:34.820\n It's a failure in leadership.\n\n1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:39.280\n I think some people would vote for Mickey Mouse\n\n1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:40.400\n just because if he ran.\n\n1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:42.000\n I mean, I have no offense against Mickey Mouse.\n\n1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:43.240\n I like him, he's a good guy, right?\n\n1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:44.360\n I mean, but like, I mean.\n\n1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:45.180\n Allegedly.\n\n1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:46.020\n Allegedly, supposedly.\n\n1:36:46.020 --> 1:36:46.840\n We don't know.\n\n1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:47.680\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.680\n But seriously, I look at some of the leaderships sometimes\n\n1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:54.640\n and go, we're in trouble.\n\n1:36:54.640 --> 1:36:57.680\n And also you lose, I think the way government\n\n1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:00.720\n is structured is people who are senators\n\n1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:04.120\n or people who are in Congress,\n\n1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:07.400\n they start playing a game between each other\n\n1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:10.700\n and they lose track of the connection to the people,\n\n1:37:10.700 --> 1:37:12.240\n to the basic humanity.\n\n1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:15.640\n So you forget, even when you think of yourself as a cop,\n\n1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:20.640\n you forget what are like the cops and the other people\n\n1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:23.480\n servicing the community actually experiencing\n\n1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.120\n all the troubles they're going through\n\n1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:26.640\n and how they can actually be helped\n\n1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:27.840\n because you lose touch to that\n\n1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:28.960\n because you're not actually living,\n\n1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:31.360\n you're not talking to them, you're not living among them.\n\n1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:33.680\n And I mean, that's a natural part of the system,\n\n1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:36.040\n but I think that's why character and great leadership\n\n1:37:36.040 --> 1:37:41.040\n is important is you say you leave the game of Congress\n\n1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:43.400\n and you go back to the people.\n\n1:37:43.400 --> 1:37:46.200\n I mean, that's what the country,\n\n1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:48.640\n it's like the George Washington ideal\n\n1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:51.320\n is you're not playing a game of power.\n\n1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.040\n You're ultimately see yourself as somebody who's servicing\n\n1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:55.680\n this country's service in the community\n\n1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:58.040\n and that requires talking to the people\n\n1:37:58.040 --> 1:37:59.440\n in their time of hardship.\n\n1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:01.840\n Well, you have some people serving\n\n1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:05.120\n in congressional districts don't even live in that district.\n\n1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:06.760\n I mean, so how are they gonna empathize?\n\n1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:09.880\n They're not even driving through there on a daily basis.\n\n1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:14.880\n And again, when anything becomes lucrative\n\n1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:20.880\n from a financial standpoint, it blurs people's vision.\n\n1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.760\n You have to take the potential\n\n1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:26.240\n of becoming rich out of politics.\n\n1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:28.760\n Politics is public service.\n\n1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:32.640\n Police and fire and EMS are public service,\n\n1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:36.160\n but cops and firemen and medics don't walk out\n\n1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:41.920\n of their career with gazillion dollar contracts\n\n1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:43.640\n with this company and that company\n\n1:38:43.640 --> 1:38:46.120\n on that board of directors and this board of directors.\n\n1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:49.080\n They walk out with a pension and that's it.\n\n1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:51.240\n And you have to wonder the intentions\n\n1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:52.800\n of people getting into politics.\n\n1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:57.480\n Are they truly going into to help the human condition\n\n1:38:57.480 --> 1:38:59.880\n or are they trying to help their own damn condition\n\n1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:01.880\n with their wallet and their pocketbook?\n\n1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:04.800\n And I try to lean toward the latter lately\n\n1:39:04.800 --> 1:39:05.640\n with what I'm seeing out there.\n\n1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:07.160\n Well, some of them are the good ones\n\n1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:10.080\n and that's our job as a society is to elevate the good ones.\n\n1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:15.080\n That's it and that has to do with the ideals that we elevate.\n\n1:39:15.080 --> 1:39:19.960\n There are a number of conspiracy theories\n\n1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:22.080\n around the events of 9 11.\n\n1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:24.560\n Do any of these hold true to you\n\n1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:28.320\n or do they just frustrate you, even anger you?\n\n1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:34.360\n I've been asked this by a few different people in my life.\n\n1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.280\n This is my take on it, right?\n\n1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:41.280\n You're a man of science and a man of education.\n\n1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:42.760\n So you...\n\n1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:43.600\n Allegedly.\n\n1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:47.080\n Allegedly, but yes, but you're a very, very intelligent man.\n\n1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:52.080\n And what I believe took place is this.\n\n1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:56.360\n Structural steel will fail\n\n1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.360\n at a sustained temperature of 1500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:03.120\n And I don't know exactly how long\n\n1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:07.760\n that would have to be sustained, but that's the temp, right?\n\n1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:12.360\n Diesel fuel, kerosene fuel, kerosene based jet fuel,\n\n1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:16.200\n which was the ignition there burns\n\n1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:19.040\n at 2200 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:24.040\n So that continued burning of that diesel, that jet fuel,\n\n1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:27.080\n but kerosene based, it's all kind of similar\n\n1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:32.040\n exceeded the temperature needed for that steel\n\n1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:35.160\n in the structural members of the trade center to fail.\n\n1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:40.560\n In my heart of hearts, I would hate to ever think\n\n1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:44.480\n that somebody affiliated with our government\n\n1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:49.480\n with some sort of agenda would perpetrate that crime\n\n1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:54.680\n and that tragic just destruction of humanity and property\n\n1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:57.840\n for some other form of gain.\n\n1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:01.000\n Those planes rammed into those buildings\n\n1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.240\n at 450 miles an hour.\n\n1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:05.240\n They were loaded with thousands and thousands\n\n1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:06.480\n of gallons of jet fuel.\n\n1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:10.240\n Number seven trade center had the backup\n\n1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:14.320\n for the emergency management system for the city.\n\n1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:18.440\n And it was an emergency generator in that complex\n\n1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:23.440\n which had a 25,000 gallon tank of diesel fuel\n\n1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:28.080\n to continually run for weeks to keep the 911 system,\n\n1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:32.960\n the backup system going in the case of a catastrophic event.\n\n1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:37.040\n Well, that tank in seven heated up from the fire\n\n1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:39.600\n that was already going on from the aircraft debris\n\n1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:41.160\n coming into the building.\n\n1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:45.720\n So once that diesel became ignited in seven,\n\n1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:50.040\n now you had enough temperature to fail that steel\n\n1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:51.360\n in that building.\n\n1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:54.960\n So I would like to truly believe what I've learned\n\n1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:57.240\n from the minimal fire science knowledge I have\n\n1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:02.240\n from my career, that it was just a matter of,\n\n1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:06.800\n it burned too long, it burned too hot and it failed.\n\n1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:09.560\n I mean, if you look at the way it came down,\n\n1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:12.200\n it came down as it was designed to\n\n1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:14.320\n in the God forbid event that it was to collapse.\n\n1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:17.880\n It came down pancaking upon itself.\n\n1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:20.640\n If it had failed horizontally\n\n1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:24.480\n and just sprayed out side to side,\n\n1:42:24.480 --> 1:42:26.240\n those buildings would have dropped for a quarter,\n\n1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:27.980\n half a mile up to Canal Street.\n\n1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:30.680\n But you know, Lex, I can't.\n\n1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:32.760\n The fire and the destruction that could have resulted.\n\n1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:35.120\n Yeah, oh my gosh, it could have been so much worse.\n\n1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:38.160\n I mean, you would have taken out every building\n\n1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:41.180\n from that point all the way up.\n\n1:42:41.180 --> 1:42:43.000\n But in my heart, I'd like to just believe\n\n1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.120\n that it was just a fire that burned too long and too hot.\n\n1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:49.540\n These planes cause structural damage upon impact\n\n1:42:49.540 --> 1:42:53.240\n in both buildings and it was just a matter of time.\n\n1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:56.040\n And then you think about it, you add all the plastics,\n\n1:42:56.040 --> 1:42:58.400\n all the carpeting, all of the stuff\n\n1:42:58.400 --> 1:43:00.100\n that was burning on those floors.\n\n1:43:00.100 --> 1:43:02.360\n You add that to that fire load.\n\n1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:05.920\n I think it just had enough to collapse it.\n\n1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:09.560\n And you were in building seven for part of that day.\n\n1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:12.040\n I was just after it came down as well.\n\n1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:15.960\n We were aside it and we weren't in it or next to it\n\n1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:17.920\n when it actually did come down.\n\n1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:20.580\n But moments after we were there.\n\n1:43:20.580 --> 1:43:25.580\n And again, I would like to believe that it just,\n\n1:43:25.640 --> 1:43:28.400\n it was just that that fuel was going\n\n1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:33.280\n and it just took its physics, took its course and it failed.\n\n1:43:34.140 --> 1:43:37.200\n So physics and science aside, it's hard.\n\n1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:40.640\n It's both I would like to believe\n\n1:43:40.640 --> 1:43:43.100\n and it's hard to imagine that anybody would be so evil\n\n1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:45.440\n as to orchestrate parts of this\n\n1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:47.620\n from within the United States government.\n\n1:43:47.620 --> 1:43:50.560\n That's very difficult for me to imagine.\n\n1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:52.620\n You know what though, Lex, there's people\n\n1:43:52.620 --> 1:43:55.100\n and I won't elaborate, I won't get into it.\n\n1:43:55.100 --> 1:43:58.940\n Any controversial subjects or what have you.\n\n1:44:00.020 --> 1:44:02.600\n There's some people that don't have any problem at all\n\n1:44:02.600 --> 1:44:04.480\n perpetrating any level of evil.\n\n1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:07.320\n People like you and I who have hearts\n\n1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:09.320\n and we have depth of soul.\n\n1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:11.640\n We couldn't imagine it, but there's other people\n\n1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:13.400\n wouldn't even be a second thought.\n\n1:44:13.400 --> 1:44:17.600\n I mean, I've seen some horrific incidents in my career\n\n1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:20.840\n that I go home shaking my head at night going,\n\n1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:23.960\n human beings are just, they're not wired right.\n\n1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:26.240\n You know, I mean, I look at animals, I love animals,\n\n1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:28.200\n I love dogs especially, right.\n\n1:44:28.200 --> 1:44:33.160\n And I see this dog park when I train to fly airplanes now\n\n1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:35.100\n and something I wanted to do.\n\n1:44:35.100 --> 1:44:37.320\n And there's a dog park across from the airport\n\n1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:40.720\n and there's 60 dogs and there's bones flying up in the air\n\n1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:43.120\n and chew toys and sticks and they're running around\n\n1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:44.920\n having the time of their life, right.\n\n1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:47.640\n And they're all getting along\n\n1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:48.840\n and they're not hurting each other.\n\n1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:50.600\n They're not violating each other.\n\n1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:53.160\n They're not canceling each other.\n\n1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:56.720\n And I'm going, we really need to learn from these dogs.\n\n1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:57.600\n Like, right.\n\n1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:59.880\n And like, I just, yeah.\n\n1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:01.520\n I mean, sometimes it sounds crazy,\n\n1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:04.960\n but I think they're a better species than people.\n\n1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:07.240\n Unless they're rabid, they don't hurt on purpose.\n\n1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:09.440\n They don't, you know, they don't cut you off in traffic\n\n1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:10.600\n and throw you the middle finger.\n\n1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:15.600\n And you know, they just don't do these acts of humanity\n\n1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:18.600\n that sometimes are so vicious.\n\n1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:20.860\n Why do you think these conspiracy theories\n\n1:45:20.860 --> 1:45:24.960\n of which there's a lot take hold?\n\n1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:27.120\n Why do you think so many people believe\n\n1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:31.800\n some version of different conspiracy theories around 9 11?\n\n1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:34.180\n Well, you know, like many things in life,\n\n1:45:34.180 --> 1:45:35.640\n it leaves me a little conflicted.\n\n1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:38.260\n I have to say this, I am at the point now,\n\n1:45:38.260 --> 1:45:40.160\n I don't know who to believe anymore.\n\n1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:44.760\n So I could see that lending a hand to someone\n\n1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:47.440\n who's already a doubter going, oh yeah, look,\n\n1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:49.600\n exactly, that's what they're doing, right.\n\n1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:52.440\n I mean, you know, look at this whole virus.\n\n1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:54.400\n Like, who do you believe?\n\n1:45:54.400 --> 1:45:56.160\n Like, where'd it come from?\n\n1:45:56.160 --> 1:46:00.000\n You know, like, and you know, if you plant that seed,\n\n1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:02.560\n it's like that little campfire\n\n1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:04.000\n we were talking about earlier, right?\n\n1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:06.660\n You just toss a little gas into those embers.\n\n1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:08.200\n You got a fire now.\n\n1:46:08.200 --> 1:46:09.800\n I also think there's a lot of people\n\n1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:12.760\n with a hell of a lot of extra time on their hands, right?\n\n1:46:12.760 --> 1:46:14.000\n And they're really bored.\n\n1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:14.840\n You know?\n\n1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:15.660\n And the two are combined.\n\n1:46:15.660 --> 1:46:17.480\n Alex, yeah, man, you know, like, look,\n\n1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:19.000\n I was a three job Charlie, right?\n\n1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.840\n You know, one guy used to say to me, anything but home.\n\n1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:24.960\n I go, no, I got deadlines, responsibilities.\n\n1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:28.800\n You know, like, that's what it comes down to is like,\n\n1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:33.120\n I mean, look, we all have our hobbies and things we like\n\n1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:34.920\n and, you know, little nuances.\n\n1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:36.660\n And that's what makes us special.\n\n1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:37.500\n We're unique.\n\n1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:40.000\n Every person is a unique being.\n\n1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.560\n But I also think some people just,\n\n1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:46.000\n they want to cling to something.\n\n1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.800\n Like, we all want to feel accepted and belong to something.\n\n1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.160\n So all of a sudden you group up with these people\n\n1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:53.960\n and you all believe this fervently.\n\n1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:55.680\n Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, they did it.\n\n1:46:55.680 --> 1:46:56.520\n They took it down.\n\n1:46:56.520 --> 1:46:57.340\n They took it down.\n\n1:46:57.340 --> 1:46:59.840\n And now you start going, yeah.\n\n1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:02.440\n And I think what happens is when you're in company of people\n\n1:47:02.440 --> 1:47:05.120\n and you start telling each other the same thing often,\n\n1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:06.560\n you freaking believe it.\n\n1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:08.640\n I mean, if you keep telling me I got a gray head of hair,\n\n1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:09.520\n I'm going to go, you know what?\n\n1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:10.360\n I do.\n\n1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:11.180\n But no, I don't.\n\n1:47:11.180 --> 1:47:12.020\n I mean, right?\n\n1:47:12.020 --> 1:47:13.080\n I got that waving bye bye do.\n\n1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:14.340\n But like, but you know,\n\n1:47:14.340 --> 1:47:17.040\n I think when you start hearing something often,\n\n1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:18.620\n you start believing it.\n\n1:47:18.620 --> 1:47:19.460\n But I'm not going to,\n\n1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:21.000\n I'm not going to doubt their intelligence.\n\n1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:22.600\n I'm not going to doubt their intentions,\n\n1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:25.920\n but I just don't see it as being plausible.\n\n1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:28.340\n I just, I, it would be too,\n\n1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:33.920\n too big of an operation to successfully happen.\n\n1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:37.360\n I, you know, I mean, look, there's other things that,\n\n1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:40.160\n you know, I won't say it on the interview there,\n\n1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:43.120\n but like I have my doubts with certain things,\n\n1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:45.040\n you know, that, that.\n\n1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:49.580\n I mean, conspiracy theories take hold for a reason.\n\n1:47:49.580 --> 1:47:50.940\n Cause some of them are true.\n\n1:47:50.940 --> 1:47:52.460\n No, yeah.\n\n1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:55.060\n The hard thing is just to know which ones is the problem.\n\n1:47:55.060 --> 1:47:56.700\n When you don't have facts, right?\n\n1:47:57.700 --> 1:47:58.860\n Or you don't know who to trust.\n\n1:47:58.860 --> 1:47:59.920\n Sometimes when you don't have facts,\n\n1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:03.100\n when you don't have figures and you don't have science,\n\n1:48:03.100 --> 1:48:05.540\n it's hard to take someone's word on it.\n\n1:48:05.540 --> 1:48:06.940\n You know, I had a conversation\n\n1:48:06.940 --> 1:48:08.460\n with someone a while back, right?\n\n1:48:08.460 --> 1:48:13.080\n And the guy's like, just, just dedicated atheist.\n\n1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:16.300\n And he thinks I'm an idiot for believing in God.\n\n1:48:16.300 --> 1:48:18.220\n And he's like, yo, you're one of those jerks\n\n1:48:18.220 --> 1:48:19.220\n who believes in creation.\n\n1:48:19.220 --> 1:48:20.980\n And I said, well, I do.\n\n1:48:20.980 --> 1:48:23.020\n Well, what about the big bang theory?\n\n1:48:23.020 --> 1:48:25.260\n He's going on his diatribe about the science\n\n1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:26.700\n and the gases and the chemistry.\n\n1:48:26.700 --> 1:48:27.740\n And I'm going, dude,\n\n1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:30.980\n I barely got through high school chemistry, slow down.\n\n1:48:30.980 --> 1:48:33.300\n And he went on a tangent and all of a sudden I stopped.\n\n1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:38.300\n I went, who, who created the gas and the molecules\n\n1:48:39.100 --> 1:48:41.780\n and the stuff you're talking about and the collisions?\n\n1:48:41.780 --> 1:48:44.740\n And he was furious and stoned off.\n\n1:48:44.740 --> 1:48:45.740\n And I got him.\n\n1:48:45.740 --> 1:48:47.540\n And again, I had no facts.\n\n1:48:47.540 --> 1:48:48.380\n I had no figure.\n\n1:48:48.380 --> 1:48:51.060\n He didn't either, but I stumped him.\n\n1:48:51.980 --> 1:48:54.260\n But sometimes when you can't show something,\n\n1:48:54.260 --> 1:48:56.940\n people need to see something tangible.\n\n1:48:56.940 --> 1:48:59.860\n They need to see it in their hand to believe it.\n\n1:48:59.860 --> 1:49:02.540\n And that's the real hard thing about faith.\n\n1:49:02.540 --> 1:49:04.380\n I see it in action.\n\n1:49:04.380 --> 1:49:06.560\n People restore my faith.\n\n1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:07.660\n And then I say to myself, well,\n\n1:49:07.660 --> 1:49:09.780\n there can't be that many dummies in this world\n\n1:49:09.780 --> 1:49:11.780\n if there's so many billions of us believing\n\n1:49:11.780 --> 1:49:13.860\n in this higher power, this higher, right?\n\n1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:16.540\n I mean, and you said, you said earlier,\n\n1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:20.620\n like you believe most people are good and I do too.\n\n1:49:20.620 --> 1:49:24.840\n The bad outshine the good because the bad get the press.\n\n1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:25.680\n Right?\n\n1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:26.740\n If it bleeds, it leads.\n\n1:49:26.740 --> 1:49:28.900\n That's just, you know, like, think about it.\n\n1:49:28.900 --> 1:49:32.360\n How many more damn zombie apocalypse movies can we make?\n\n1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:33.200\n Right?\n\n1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:34.340\n I didn't even know there was that many zombies.\n\n1:49:34.340 --> 1:49:35.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:35.180 --> 1:49:36.440\n And it just seems like every other show\n\n1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.140\n is just guys like, you know,\n\n1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:40.660\n bashing each other's heads in with bats with nails in it.\n\n1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:41.900\n And it's like, after a while, it's like,\n\n1:49:41.900 --> 1:49:44.180\n all right, gosh, you gotta get a new boogeyman here.\n\n1:49:44.180 --> 1:49:45.020\n You know, right?\n\n1:49:45.020 --> 1:49:46.360\n Like, but seriously, like.\n\n1:49:47.540 --> 1:49:49.460\n But meanwhile, human civilization\n\n1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:50.380\n is getting better and better.\n\n1:49:50.380 --> 1:49:52.580\n We're just like making Hollywood movies.\n\n1:49:52.580 --> 1:49:53.400\n They just.\n\n1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:54.240\n No, we're getting better and better,\n\n1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:55.660\n but we're treating each other worse and worse.\n\n1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:57.180\n You would think with all this technology\n\n1:49:57.180 --> 1:49:59.080\n and all the knowledge and all the,\n\n1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:01.820\n it's like, what the hell is going on sometimes?\n\n1:50:01.820 --> 1:50:04.380\n Like, I really want to see the good.\n\n1:50:04.380 --> 1:50:06.540\n And I think maybe, maybe the level of bad\n\n1:50:06.540 --> 1:50:08.660\n that we're seeing was always existent.\n\n1:50:08.660 --> 1:50:11.340\n It's just now everything is instantaneous news\n\n1:50:11.340 --> 1:50:13.540\n and flashes and tweets and this and this.\n\n1:50:13.540 --> 1:50:15.820\n Like, like, you know.\n\n1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:17.440\n Well, with the technology we have,\n\n1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:18.540\n it's also come to the light.\n\n1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:20.660\n So you get to see all these fights.\n\n1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:22.660\n It almost, I think that's step one\n\n1:50:22.660 --> 1:50:25.540\n of dealing with the problem is revealing it\n\n1:50:25.540 --> 1:50:27.260\n in its full beautiful light.\n\n1:50:27.260 --> 1:50:28.180\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:29.980\n How much of a bickering species we are.\n\n1:50:29.980 --> 1:50:32.300\n 50 years ago, a guy like me who loves to talk,\n\n1:50:32.300 --> 1:50:33.980\n how the hell would I have gotten an opportunity\n\n1:50:33.980 --> 1:50:36.300\n to have someone listen to me and have, right?\n\n1:50:36.300 --> 1:50:37.140\n I love this.\n\n1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:37.960\n This is amazing.\n\n1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:38.800\n It's cool.\n\n1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:41.100\n But like, but you didn't have that arena.\n\n1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:42.500\n You didn't have all these things.\n\n1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:45.940\n My grandfather, Nels, God rest him, he died in 1979.\n\n1:50:45.940 --> 1:50:47.420\n I mean, that dude didn't even want to have\n\n1:50:47.420 --> 1:50:48.420\n a checking account.\n\n1:50:48.420 --> 1:50:51.220\n He would walk to each store, each, the phone company,\n\n1:50:51.220 --> 1:50:54.780\n the gas company, this company, and pay the bill in person.\n\n1:50:54.780 --> 1:50:56.220\n He didn't trust the bank.\n\n1:50:57.300 --> 1:51:00.660\n And it was like, now, ATMs, this, that,\n\n1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:01.620\n he would be overwhelmed.\n\n1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:04.100\n He'd be just like, I mean, I love my dad,\n\n1:51:04.100 --> 1:51:07.220\n but to watch him on his iPad is comical, right?\n\n1:51:07.220 --> 1:51:09.620\n He calls my niece's boyfriend, who's a tech guy,\n\n1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:12.100\n Matt, Matt, if you listen, he's the greatest.\n\n1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:14.340\n He'll have this poor guy on the phone for like hours.\n\n1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:17.780\n Like the second you'll walk in to see my father, my kids,\n\n1:51:17.780 --> 1:51:20.220\n hey, do me a favor, you fucking straighten out this pad.\n\n1:51:20.220 --> 1:51:23.820\n And it's comical because I'm looking at my dad\n\n1:51:23.820 --> 1:51:28.380\n and I'm going, he was born when Hitler started World War II.\n\n1:51:28.380 --> 1:51:29.220\n Yeah, wow.\n\n1:51:29.220 --> 1:51:30.500\n And I'm going, he's seen all of that.\n\n1:51:30.500 --> 1:51:34.460\n Oh, my wife's grandmother was born in 1900 in Czechoslovakia\n\n1:51:34.460 --> 1:51:35.900\n and she died in 1998.\n\n1:51:35.900 --> 1:51:40.340\n I'm going, holy, the stuff she saw in the span of her life,\n\n1:51:40.340 --> 1:51:42.100\n just, it's just incredible.\n\n1:51:42.100 --> 1:51:45.100\n But what troubles me sometimes is with all of these advances\n\n1:51:45.100 --> 1:51:47.700\n and all these devices, this is what I say to my kids,\n\n1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:54.700\n look up from the phone and look up, right?\n\n1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.780\n Because we don't talk anymore.\n\n1:51:56.780 --> 1:52:01.500\n I saw a girl literally, and I shouldn't say girl, guy,\n\n1:52:01.500 --> 1:52:04.380\n whatever, I saw a person literally just about walking\n\n1:52:04.380 --> 1:52:06.140\n to an open manhole cover texting.\n\n1:52:07.100 --> 1:52:08.700\n And I'm going, that's scary\n\n1:52:08.700 --> 1:52:11.940\n because your awareness is gone.\n\n1:52:11.940 --> 1:52:16.620\n And it's, I've been at restaurants, groups of people\n\n1:52:16.620 --> 1:52:18.860\n and they're texting, they're texting each other\n\n1:52:18.860 --> 1:52:20.260\n just sitting on the other side of the table.\n\n1:52:20.260 --> 1:52:22.300\n I'm like, put the freaking thing down\n\n1:52:22.300 --> 1:52:23.580\n and have a conversation.\n\n1:52:23.580 --> 1:52:26.140\n And that's the thing, we've lost the art of conversation.\n\n1:52:26.140 --> 1:52:30.140\n You know, like, my wife runs, she has this running joke.\n\n1:52:30.140 --> 1:52:31.860\n She goes, there's a lot going on up there.\n\n1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:34.300\n And I'm like, yeah, because I really, I'm inquisitive.\n\n1:52:34.300 --> 1:52:35.580\n I'm excited about life.\n\n1:52:35.580 --> 1:52:36.460\n I love to meet people.\n\n1:52:36.460 --> 1:52:37.300\n I love to learn.\n\n1:52:37.300 --> 1:52:38.940\n I love, and the only way you can do that\n\n1:52:38.940 --> 1:52:40.420\n is to have a conversation.\n\n1:52:40.420 --> 1:52:41.580\n The hilarious thing about this,\n\n1:52:41.580 --> 1:52:43.620\n so you're obviously very charismatic.\n\n1:52:43.620 --> 1:52:44.660\n You got great stories.\n\n1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:45.900\n You're a great human being.\n\n1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:46.740\n Thank you.\n\n1:52:46.740 --> 1:52:48.300\n And you're talking to a guy who spent most of his life\n\n1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:50.060\n behind a computer hiding from people.\n\n1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:50.900\n No, no, and I don't.\n\n1:52:50.900 --> 1:52:52.580\n But we're like trying to bridge this.\n\n1:52:52.580 --> 1:52:53.860\n Right, but I don't mean that as a rip,\n\n1:52:53.860 --> 1:52:55.540\n but you, I would never know that.\n\n1:52:55.540 --> 1:52:57.500\n I would never know that because you're very engaging.\n\n1:52:57.500 --> 1:52:59.260\n You're very, like, I would not know,\n\n1:52:59.260 --> 1:53:02.020\n like you don't have any impediments\n\n1:53:02.020 --> 1:53:06.140\n to your social skills, your personal, and that's,\n\n1:53:06.140 --> 1:53:08.100\n and again, I don't mean it as a knock to you\n\n1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:08.940\n and these young people.\n\n1:53:08.940 --> 1:53:10.300\n Well, no, but this is me trying to look up\n\n1:53:10.300 --> 1:53:12.740\n from a smartphone is having these conversations,\n\n1:53:12.740 --> 1:53:13.700\n talking to people.\n\n1:53:13.700 --> 1:53:15.020\n I think it's important.\n\n1:53:15.020 --> 1:53:18.380\n I mean, some of it could be, it's always hard to know.\n\n1:53:18.380 --> 1:53:22.860\n Some of it could be just you and I being old school,\n\n1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:25.020\n because you grew up before the internet.\n\n1:53:25.020 --> 1:53:27.340\n Maybe there is joy and deep human connection\n\n1:53:27.340 --> 1:53:29.580\n to be discovered inside the smartphone.\n\n1:53:29.580 --> 1:53:31.620\n We don't, it doesn't seem that way,\n\n1:53:31.620 --> 1:53:33.540\n because the smartphone's so new,\n\n1:53:33.540 --> 1:53:37.260\n maybe we just haven't figured out those things,\n\n1:53:37.260 --> 1:53:39.060\n because there's a globalizing aspect.\n\n1:53:39.060 --> 1:53:42.060\n There's a opportunity for you to connect with people\n\n1:53:42.060 --> 1:53:44.940\n from across the world in ways that.\n\n1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:46.580\n I have cousins in Ireland and England.\n\n1:53:46.580 --> 1:53:47.420\n I love it.\n\n1:53:47.420 --> 1:53:50.860\n I get a FaceTime or a WhatsApp and it's like, holy crap,\n\n1:53:50.860 --> 1:53:53.020\n they're, you know, three, 4,000 miles away\n\n1:53:53.020 --> 1:53:54.900\n and I'm having a conversation now.\n\n1:53:54.900 --> 1:53:58.020\n I used to send my grandma in Ireland a letter.\n\n1:53:58.020 --> 1:53:58.860\n I adored her.\n\n1:53:58.860 --> 1:54:01.620\n She passed when I was 10.\n\n1:54:01.620 --> 1:54:03.500\n And, no, I'm sorry, I was 11.\n\n1:54:03.500 --> 1:54:07.140\n And I sent her a letter, airmailed,\n\n1:54:07.140 --> 1:54:11.300\n and I'd wait and I'd wait, and about two weeks later,\n\n1:54:11.300 --> 1:54:13.900\n this airmail letter would come back\n\n1:54:13.900 --> 1:54:16.740\n and she'd call me Master Nils William Jorgensen.\n\n1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:18.940\n I would be so excited, open that bad letter.\n\n1:54:18.940 --> 1:54:21.260\n Handwritten, just like. Yeah, and like,\n\n1:54:21.260 --> 1:54:22.900\n and then I'd write her another one\n\n1:54:22.900 --> 1:54:25.980\n and I just couldn't wait for letters from granny.\n\n1:54:25.980 --> 1:54:30.460\n And now it's like, you know, that's kind of faded away.\n\n1:54:30.460 --> 1:54:32.540\n Yeah, I still write letters, by the way, handwritten.\n\n1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:33.820\n I do too.\n\n1:54:33.820 --> 1:54:38.500\n The way this all came about was I wrote a letter\n\n1:54:38.500 --> 1:54:41.220\n to someone to say thank you for cancer research.\n\n1:54:42.540 --> 1:54:44.060\n I'm blessed to be alive.\n\n1:54:44.060 --> 1:54:45.220\n My cancer, right?\n\n1:54:45.220 --> 1:54:47.020\n That's a good starting point for any story.\n\n1:54:47.020 --> 1:54:47.940\n I'm blessed to be alive.\n\n1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:51.260\n And my cancer was one that if I got it 15 years prior\n\n1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:55.740\n to 19, excuse me, 2011, I was a dead man, right?\n\n1:54:55.740 --> 1:54:58.220\n 15, 20 years before there was no drug to treat.\n\n1:54:58.220 --> 1:55:00.380\n I was gone, going home to see him.\n\n1:55:01.420 --> 1:55:03.580\n So there's this wonderful gentleman\n\n1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:06.100\n that donated hundreds of millions of dollars\n\n1:55:06.100 --> 1:55:09.220\n to cancer research, Mr. David Koch.\n\n1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:12.100\n He's since, God rest his soul, passed away.\n\n1:55:12.100 --> 1:55:14.780\n And he's a controversial guy, big time business titan.\n\n1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:17.580\n And, you know, there was,\n\n1:55:17.580 --> 1:55:20.060\n the press was just brutalizing him one day\n\n1:55:20.060 --> 1:55:22.500\n over something to do with his politics.\n\n1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:26.700\n Now, I'm a union guy, proudly served in unions,\n\n1:55:26.700 --> 1:55:27.860\n still in a union, you know?\n\n1:55:27.860 --> 1:55:29.860\n And he was not, you know,\n\n1:55:29.860 --> 1:55:32.300\n most business guys don't like unions, right?\n\n1:55:32.300 --> 1:55:34.660\n But, you know, most guys like me don't like working\n\n1:55:34.660 --> 1:55:38.300\n for $3 an hour, so we like our unions, right?\n\n1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:40.860\n And I reached out across the table, so to speak,\n\n1:55:40.860 --> 1:55:43.900\n and I sent him a handwritten letter to thank him,\n\n1:55:43.900 --> 1:55:46.140\n to say, we may not agree on everything,\n\n1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:47.300\n but I can't thank you enough.\n\n1:55:47.300 --> 1:55:49.340\n There's just this regular dude out there\n\n1:55:49.340 --> 1:55:52.340\n who is now living his life, watching his kids grow.\n\n1:55:52.340 --> 1:55:54.300\n Thanks to generous people like you\n\n1:55:54.300 --> 1:55:57.060\n who believe enough in cancer research, you've saved my life.\n\n1:55:57.060 --> 1:56:00.340\n Maybe, I can't say his exact dollars, but people like him.\n\n1:56:01.500 --> 1:56:04.260\n And he reached back out and his secretary said,\n\n1:56:04.260 --> 1:56:05.380\n oh, he'd like to talk to you on the phone.\n\n1:56:05.380 --> 1:56:07.020\n I go, well, he's kind of a busy guy,\n\n1:56:07.020 --> 1:56:08.420\n he wants to talk to me, he's a billionaire.\n\n1:56:08.420 --> 1:56:09.300\n And he got on the phone,\n\n1:56:09.300 --> 1:56:11.220\n he was like the greatest guy in the world.\n\n1:56:11.220 --> 1:56:12.580\n Invited me up to Sloan Kettering\n\n1:56:12.580 --> 1:56:14.980\n to dedicate a new cancer wing.\n\n1:56:14.980 --> 1:56:17.380\n It was like I was hanging out with my dad.\n\n1:56:17.380 --> 1:56:22.340\n And the sweetest man, just so kind, so empathy,\n\n1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:23.940\n because he was a cancer survivor.\n\n1:56:23.940 --> 1:56:28.300\n But now he's got the means to help people\n\n1:56:28.300 --> 1:56:32.660\n who've suffered his fate to a better place.\n\n1:56:32.660 --> 1:56:35.460\n And he was so real and it was so beautiful\n\n1:56:35.460 --> 1:56:37.100\n just to get to know, say, hey, you know what?\n\n1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:39.420\n This guy is a big time guy,\n\n1:56:39.420 --> 1:56:42.860\n but yeah, he's just a regular human like you and I.\n\n1:56:42.860 --> 1:56:45.860\n I'm a guy who went to night college and I went to the army\n\n1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:47.700\n and I'm a blue collar kind of dude.\n\n1:56:47.700 --> 1:56:49.860\n And here's this guy who went to MIT, like you,\n\n1:56:49.860 --> 1:56:53.860\n and he's a wildly successful billionaire, a genius.\n\n1:56:53.860 --> 1:56:58.300\n But yet he can sit down and mix it up with me\n\n1:56:58.300 --> 1:56:59.980\n and know that I was truly grateful.\n\n1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:02.340\n And that to me was just like one of the coolest\n\n1:57:03.260 --> 1:57:05.220\n little relationships I've ever had.\n\n1:57:05.220 --> 1:57:06.300\n It wasn't like we were hanging out,\n\n1:57:06.300 --> 1:57:08.260\n having barbecues together, but like, you know,\n\n1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:11.580\n it was just, I was so touched by his decency.\n\n1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:16.580\n Well, the basics of the, like cancer reveals, you know,\n\n1:57:16.700 --> 1:57:18.660\n it's like fundamental to the human experience.\n\n1:57:18.660 --> 1:57:20.900\n It's trauma, it's tragedy.\n\n1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:22.860\n It's like money, who gives a shit about money?\n\n1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:27.140\n Education, all of that is like weird new inventions.\n\n1:57:27.140 --> 1:57:29.380\n You know, life is short.\n\n1:57:29.380 --> 1:57:31.340\n You suffer with the various diseases.\n\n1:57:31.340 --> 1:57:34.140\n And that is a reminder that life is short\n\n1:57:34.140 --> 1:57:36.220\n and a reminder of the basic human connection.\n\n1:57:36.220 --> 1:57:38.380\n And that's why you can bridge that gap.\n\n1:57:38.380 --> 1:57:39.220\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:40.460\n All sparked by a handwritten letter,\n\n1:57:40.460 --> 1:57:42.780\n which just makes for a hell of a story.\n\n1:57:42.780 --> 1:57:43.620\n And you know what, Lex?\n\n1:57:43.620 --> 1:57:45.940\n This is the commonality between us.\n\n1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:48.540\n A guy with three jobs to a billionaire.\n\n1:57:48.540 --> 1:57:51.820\n We both had that sense of a sledgehammer to the chest.\n\n1:57:51.820 --> 1:57:55.540\n Boom, you have cancer and you can't breathe\n\n1:57:55.540 --> 1:57:56.820\n for like 30 seconds.\n\n1:57:58.380 --> 1:58:00.260\n And then when your heart's just about to kick off\n\n1:58:00.260 --> 1:58:02.740\n and you take a breath and you go, I'm sorry,\n\n1:58:02.740 --> 1:58:04.180\n what'd you say, doc?\n\n1:58:04.180 --> 1:58:06.020\n You have cancer.\n\n1:58:06.020 --> 1:58:08.380\n And it don't matter what kind.\n\n1:58:08.380 --> 1:58:11.380\n One of my best buddies, Bobby's going through right now,\n\n1:58:11.380 --> 1:58:14.340\n a prostate, and I got way too many of my buddies\n\n1:58:14.340 --> 1:58:15.740\n with cancer, right?\n\n1:58:15.740 --> 1:58:18.580\n My buddy, Hugh, who became a vet since his first cancer,\n\n1:58:18.580 --> 1:58:20.500\n he was a fireman, he's now a veterinarian, right?\n\n1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:23.100\n He diagnosed me actually over the phone, by the way.\n\n1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:25.940\n When they couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.\n\n1:58:25.940 --> 1:58:29.060\n Well, Dr. Hugh, he nailed it to the T.\n\n1:58:30.100 --> 1:58:31.100\n And we talk.\n\n1:58:32.340 --> 1:58:34.980\n And the same thing that the dozen of my close friends\n\n1:58:34.980 --> 1:58:39.820\n that have cancer, the same thing we say is the fear.\n\n1:58:39.820 --> 1:58:43.340\n So Mr. Koch and I, we shared that same sledgehammer\n\n1:58:43.340 --> 1:58:46.020\n to the chest and that same fear.\n\n1:58:46.020 --> 1:58:47.940\n And it didn't matter how much money he had\n\n1:58:47.940 --> 1:58:49.460\n and how much I didn't.\n\n1:58:49.460 --> 1:58:52.180\n And you know, it's just like the morning of the trade center.\n\n1:58:52.180 --> 1:58:57.180\n There was big time brokers who went to their demise, right?\n\n1:58:57.460 --> 1:58:59.740\n Working in these firms, God rest them.\n\n1:58:59.740 --> 1:59:01.500\n And there was dishwashers, excuse me,\n\n1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:04.740\n dishwashers up on the windows on the world restaurant\n\n1:59:04.740 --> 1:59:08.900\n on the 107th floor, making five bucks an hour.\n\n1:59:08.900 --> 1:59:10.460\n And they died together, it didn't matter.\n\n1:59:10.460 --> 1:59:12.340\n It didn't matter if you had an armored car\n\n1:59:12.340 --> 1:59:15.300\n loaded with bills, you were done that day.\n\n1:59:15.300 --> 1:59:17.460\n And that's, I think where people need\n\n1:59:17.460 --> 1:59:19.500\n to humanize each other.\n\n1:59:19.500 --> 1:59:21.980\n Just because you drive around in a nice car\n\n1:59:21.980 --> 1:59:25.500\n and you got your own jet and you got this and you got that,\n\n1:59:25.500 --> 1:59:26.500\n don't mean nothing.\n\n1:59:26.500 --> 1:59:29.500\n When you're going, when you're in that vulnerable spot,\n\n1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:34.460\n you could have more money than the US reserves.\n\n1:59:34.460 --> 1:59:38.900\n Federal reserve, or you could have a welfare check.\n\n1:59:38.900 --> 1:59:40.180\n You're going.\n\n1:59:40.180 --> 1:59:41.580\n I learned that in a cancer ward.\n\n1:59:41.580 --> 1:59:44.020\n I had people in my ward that died on me.\n\n1:59:45.140 --> 1:59:47.740\n I was going around as a little bit of an ambassador\n\n1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:50.540\n because I was trying to, I was putting on a fake,\n\n1:59:50.540 --> 1:59:53.340\n I was putting on a fake like I got this, I got this.\n\n1:59:53.340 --> 1:59:54.860\n I was so scared.\n\n1:59:54.860 --> 1:59:58.860\n But when I got past that seven days of torture\n\n2:00:00.060 --> 2:00:01.820\n and the days leading up to it,\n\n2:00:01.820 --> 2:00:05.540\n I'd go around and try to comfort the other cancer patients.\n\n2:00:05.540 --> 2:00:07.780\n I had this one older African American gentleman,\n\n2:00:07.780 --> 2:00:08.820\n he couldn't talk because he had\n\n2:00:08.820 --> 2:00:10.860\n such advanced throat cancer.\n\n2:00:10.860 --> 2:00:12.500\n He was my roommate for a little while,\n\n2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:15.300\n but then he got worse so they had to put him by himself.\n\n2:00:16.860 --> 2:00:18.340\n And you couldn't understand what he was saying\n\n2:00:18.340 --> 2:00:22.220\n because his throat was just so radiated from the radiation.\n\n2:00:22.220 --> 2:00:25.780\n But if you put your ear down to him,\n\n2:00:25.780 --> 2:00:27.620\n you could make out what he was saying.\n\n2:00:28.740 --> 2:00:30.140\n And I'm not faulting the nurses\n\n2:00:30.140 --> 2:00:31.740\n for maybe not wanting to do that, right?\n\n2:00:31.740 --> 2:00:34.300\n They're busy, they got a ton going on,\n\n2:00:34.300 --> 2:00:36.020\n they can't spend, you know.\n\n2:00:36.020 --> 2:00:39.700\n So if he was in need, I'd put my ear down\n\n2:00:39.700 --> 2:00:42.780\n and I'd find out and I'd go get it for him.\n\n2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:45.140\n So when they moved me down the hall,\n\n2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:50.380\n they asked me to come down with my IV tower.\n\n2:00:50.380 --> 2:00:51.340\n He needed me.\n\n2:00:52.780 --> 2:00:57.780\n And I knew it was bad because he just, his look was gone.\n\n2:00:57.780 --> 2:00:59.700\n And I said, sir, what do you need?\n\n2:01:01.700 --> 2:01:04.780\n And he whispered, call my sister, I'm going.\n\n2:01:06.180 --> 2:01:09.460\n He had only one survivor in his whole life.\n\n2:01:09.460 --> 2:01:11.620\n And she was in North Carolina and he wanted her to know\n\n2:01:11.620 --> 2:01:13.500\n she couldn't get up, she was elderly.\n\n2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:18.220\n And I got the nurse and I got on the phone\n\n2:01:18.220 --> 2:01:20.500\n and I called his sister and I said, ma'm,\n\n2:01:20.500 --> 2:01:22.100\n I explained who I was.\n\n2:01:23.380 --> 2:01:26.380\n And I said, he can't really talk.\n\n2:01:26.380 --> 2:01:29.940\n He can't really verbalize too well right now,\n\n2:01:29.940 --> 2:01:31.860\n but he wants to say he loves you.\n\n2:01:38.260 --> 2:01:42.180\n And I put the phone down and he told her he loved her\n\n2:01:42.180 --> 2:01:43.740\n and he said, I'm going home.\n\n2:01:46.460 --> 2:01:47.380\n And that was it.\n\n2:01:47.380 --> 2:01:50.700\n And I hung the phone up and I said, ma'm, I'm so sorry.\n\n2:01:50.700 --> 2:01:52.500\n I said, you know, they'll notify you.\n\n2:01:53.700 --> 2:01:55.620\n And I stayed with him for a while holding his hand\n\n2:01:55.620 --> 2:01:57.740\n and then, you know, they wanted him to rest.\n\n2:01:57.740 --> 2:02:01.940\n And then I left and then I got the tap an hour later\n\n2:02:01.940 --> 2:02:03.700\n and they said, I'm sorry, he's gone.\n\n2:02:05.580 --> 2:02:09.500\n And then there was another girl and she was a young girl\n\n2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:13.260\n from one of the areas I work, young African American girl\n\n2:02:13.260 --> 2:02:14.820\n where I used to respond and I didn't know her,\n\n2:02:14.820 --> 2:02:15.900\n but I knew her neighborhood.\n\n2:02:15.900 --> 2:02:20.700\n And she had what I had, but they weren't sure which one.\n\n2:02:20.700 --> 2:02:22.940\n You know, leukemias, they're an elusive beast.\n\n2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:24.340\n There's 49 of them, right?\n\n2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:25.740\n And each one of them is like,\n\n2:02:26.740 --> 2:02:28.900\n they got their own little nuances,\n\n2:02:28.900 --> 2:02:30.260\n own specific treatments.\n\n2:02:30.260 --> 2:02:31.620\n So if they don't know what you have,\n\n2:02:31.620 --> 2:02:34.020\n they don't know what to do for you.\n\n2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:35.940\n And she refused to let him drill into her hip\n\n2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:37.740\n to take the marrow because it's vicious.\n\n2:02:37.740 --> 2:02:38.700\n It hurts so much.\n\n2:02:38.700 --> 2:02:41.620\n It's like someone born into your hip with a wood drill\n\n2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:43.900\n and it's no joke.\n\n2:02:45.820 --> 2:02:48.500\n And they asked me to try to convince her\n\n2:02:48.500 --> 2:02:52.220\n to let them do that or she was gonna die.\n\n2:02:52.220 --> 2:02:54.900\n Cause if they couldn't figure it out, it was advancing quickly.\n\n2:02:54.900 --> 2:02:59.340\n She was, so I talked to her and she said,\n\n2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:01.140\n I can't, I can't, I'm too scared.\n\n2:03:02.060 --> 2:03:03.740\n I said, but are you more scared to die?\n\n2:03:03.740 --> 2:03:04.940\n And she said, I am.\n\n2:03:04.940 --> 2:03:07.300\n I said, okay, I'll stay with you.\n\n2:03:07.300 --> 2:03:08.340\n I'll hold your hand.\n\n2:03:08.340 --> 2:03:10.660\n You squeeze it as hard as you want.\n\n2:03:10.660 --> 2:03:13.380\n I said, if you want, they'll give you like a towel\n\n2:03:13.380 --> 2:03:14.580\n or something to bite on, whatever.\n\n2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:16.580\n I said, but you get that pain out,\n\n2:03:16.580 --> 2:03:19.940\n but you need to do this so you can get saved.\n\n2:03:19.940 --> 2:03:22.700\n And she said, okay.\n\n2:03:22.700 --> 2:03:25.260\n And they came in and they, this huge thick needle,\n\n2:03:25.260 --> 2:03:27.100\n they just bore it into you.\n\n2:03:27.100 --> 2:03:29.020\n And she's screaming for her life\n\n2:03:29.020 --> 2:03:32.380\n and she's squeezing my fingers so hard and so hard.\n\n2:03:32.380 --> 2:03:33.420\n And I said, that's okay, hon.\n\n2:03:33.420 --> 2:03:34.820\n You keep going, you keep going.\n\n2:03:34.820 --> 2:03:35.660\n We got it.\n\n2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:37.540\n It's just 10 more seconds, 10 more seconds.\n\n2:03:38.620 --> 2:03:39.980\n They got it.\n\n2:03:39.980 --> 2:03:41.420\n They figured out her treatment\n\n2:03:42.300 --> 2:03:44.380\n and they got her onto her road to recovery.\n\n2:03:44.380 --> 2:03:49.380\n And then I spent a long time asking God, why do I have cancer?\n\n2:03:55.500 --> 2:03:57.460\n Then I stopped and I went, wait a minute.\n\n2:03:57.460 --> 2:03:59.820\n I didn't die that day with my friends.\n\n2:04:02.060 --> 2:04:04.500\n Shame on me for asking them why I have cancer.\n\n2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:08.940\n I had 10 years after 9 11 with such great ears.\n\n2:04:08.940 --> 2:04:13.940\n And I got to watch my little girl being born\n\n2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:16.980\n when John never got to see his son.\n\n2:04:16.980 --> 2:04:19.060\n So it was all gravy after that.\n\n2:04:20.140 --> 2:04:23.100\n And I said, but now I know why I have my cancer\n\n2:04:23.100 --> 2:04:27.020\n because I can empathize with people who have it.\n\n2:04:27.860 --> 2:04:31.500\n And I can try to be their voice when they can't talk,\n\n2:04:32.500 --> 2:04:35.660\n be their shield to try to take that pain\n\n2:04:35.660 --> 2:04:38.820\n because I can understand, I can walk their walk.\n\n2:04:41.500 --> 2:04:43.220\n And now I thank God for my cancer\n\n2:04:44.100 --> 2:04:45.940\n because it's made me a better human being.\n\n2:04:45.940 --> 2:04:47.780\n It's made me, I'm not gonna lie,\n\n2:04:47.780 --> 2:04:49.340\n it brought a lot of anger for a while\n\n2:04:49.340 --> 2:04:52.260\n and my family suffered it,\n\n2:04:52.260 --> 2:04:55.980\n but I really tried to go past that and heal\n\n2:04:55.980 --> 2:04:57.940\n and part of living out in the country.\n\n2:04:57.940 --> 2:05:00.980\n It's very, very healing for the mind and the soul.\n\n2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:04.700\n But I now thank God for the cancer\n\n2:05:04.700 --> 2:05:06.300\n because it humbled me.\n\n2:05:06.300 --> 2:05:07.460\n I didn't really need humbling.\n\n2:05:07.460 --> 2:05:11.380\n I wasn't an arrogant puffed up type of person at all,\n\n2:05:11.380 --> 2:05:15.180\n but maybe I was running away at myself a little bit\n\n2:05:15.180 --> 2:05:17.500\n and working on a TV show, I'm fine, man.\n\n2:05:17.500 --> 2:05:20.940\n 30 at the time, well, I was 42, I got sick.\n\n2:05:20.940 --> 2:05:22.780\n Life was cruising, man, it was great.\n\n2:05:23.660 --> 2:05:26.740\n And then all of a sudden it was like a blow out\n\n2:05:26.740 --> 2:05:28.260\n on the highway in the middle of the night\n\n2:05:28.260 --> 2:05:30.820\n and you were just veering off towards the guardrail.\n\n2:05:30.820 --> 2:05:35.140\n Yeah, you remembered, you're reminded that you're mortal\n\n2:05:35.140 --> 2:05:39.300\n and that's ultimately a connection to all the rest of us.\n\n2:05:39.300 --> 2:05:41.780\n Oh yeah, it's a good thing though,\n\n2:05:41.780 --> 2:05:42.900\n because that's the problem, I think.\n\n2:05:42.900 --> 2:05:44.140\n There's a lot of people running around\n\n2:05:44.140 --> 2:05:46.260\n and thinking they're immortal, right?\n\n2:05:46.260 --> 2:05:47.460\n You know, when you look at it, Lex, right?\n\n2:05:47.460 --> 2:05:51.380\n You look at the heartache in a lot of segments of people\n\n2:05:51.380 --> 2:05:54.740\n and anytime like someone that's got fame and wealth\n\n2:05:54.740 --> 2:05:58.580\n and success and they die tragically,\n\n2:05:58.580 --> 2:06:01.300\n a lot of times it's from a substance abuse\n\n2:06:01.300 --> 2:06:04.820\n or just some horrible death.\n\n2:06:05.780 --> 2:06:07.580\n And I used to say to myself,\n\n2:06:07.580 --> 2:06:10.180\n how the hell would someone with that much money\n\n2:06:10.180 --> 2:06:12.300\n and that much fame and this freaking mansion\n\n2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:16.380\n and I love cars, my son and I are just big car heads,\n\n2:06:16.380 --> 2:06:19.420\n you know, I'm like, you know, this guy's got a collection\n\n2:06:19.420 --> 2:06:23.700\n of cars and he overdosed because he was sad.\n\n2:06:23.700 --> 2:06:25.860\n And I'm going, how the frig are you sad?\n\n2:06:25.860 --> 2:06:28.900\n But then I stop and I go, okay,\n\n2:06:28.900 --> 2:06:31.740\n because maybe he doesn't have any idea who loves him.\n\n2:06:31.740 --> 2:06:33.700\n He's got a lot of people clinging onto him\n\n2:06:33.700 --> 2:06:35.380\n because of his success.\n\n2:06:35.380 --> 2:06:40.020\n And he just, he can't fill that void, you know?\n\n2:06:40.020 --> 2:06:42.700\n And then they fill the void with something destructive.\n\n2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:46.860\n And I'm not bashing people that have substance abuse\n\n2:06:46.860 --> 2:06:49.340\n problems or alcohol problems, I don't mean it that way.\n\n2:06:49.340 --> 2:06:54.340\n But what I mean is it's just sad that their level\n\n2:06:54.340 --> 2:06:57.660\n of despair is so high, on the surface,\n\n2:06:57.660 --> 2:06:59.860\n they look like they just got everything going on.\n\n2:06:59.860 --> 2:07:00.700\n It's all great, right?\n\n2:07:00.700 --> 2:07:02.860\n They're still human, still got to deal with the same.\n\n2:07:02.860 --> 2:07:05.500\n Yeah, exactly, because they want love, right?\n\n2:07:05.500 --> 2:07:10.500\n They want love and they can't really find it.\n\n2:07:11.140 --> 2:07:12.700\n Well, first of all, that's true for all of us.\n\n2:07:12.700 --> 2:07:14.700\n I think we're deeply lonely and looking for love\n\n2:07:14.700 --> 2:07:16.820\n and when we find it, that's what friendship is.\n\n2:07:16.820 --> 2:07:17.780\n Absolutely.\n\n2:07:17.780 --> 2:07:21.060\n And then that's true for whether you're super rich\n\n2:07:21.060 --> 2:07:23.980\n or super poor, it's all the same journey.\n\n2:07:23.980 --> 2:07:26.540\n My dad said all the time, kid, you're gonna end up\n\n2:07:26.540 --> 2:07:30.060\n working with hundreds of guys and you'll love a lot of them\n\n2:07:30.060 --> 2:07:32.220\n but he says when it's all said and done\n\n2:07:32.220 --> 2:07:33.780\n and you're all like me and if you've still got\n\n2:07:33.780 --> 2:07:36.500\n two or three of them that you talk to and you'll love.\n\n2:07:36.500 --> 2:07:40.860\n And I tell you what, I mean, I have thanked the Lord\n\n2:07:40.860 --> 2:07:43.420\n more than two or three of them and I have my six,\n\n2:07:43.420 --> 2:07:45.580\n I call it my six, it's the six guys that are gonna\n\n2:07:45.580 --> 2:07:47.820\n carry my coffin when I'm gone, right?\n\n2:07:47.820 --> 2:07:50.340\n Because I know this cancer's gonna come back, I know it.\n\n2:07:50.340 --> 2:07:51.940\n Like we get multiples, right?\n\n2:07:51.940 --> 2:07:54.180\n My friend Yvette just got his second.\n\n2:07:54.180 --> 2:07:56.180\n My friend Mike's had five of them.\n\n2:07:56.180 --> 2:07:58.740\n My other Mike has two of them, yeah.\n\n2:07:58.740 --> 2:08:03.740\n But I wasn't ready to accept it in 2011.\n\n2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:06.260\n There was so much more to do and it was so much,\n\n2:08:06.260 --> 2:08:08.780\n I was so scared, I'm like wow, who's gonna take care\n\n2:08:08.780 --> 2:08:11.500\n of my kids and who, you know, they were little.\n\n2:08:11.500 --> 2:08:13.460\n Nine, 11 and 14, right?\n\n2:08:13.460 --> 2:08:15.780\n It's like what the hell, I have two girls and a boy\n\n2:08:15.780 --> 2:08:17.220\n in between and they're beautiful kids.\n\n2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:20.060\n They're such good, good children, adults now.\n\n2:08:20.060 --> 2:08:23.460\n I mean, but you know, my wife's a drill sergeant,\n\n2:08:23.460 --> 2:08:26.620\n she's tough, she don't mess, you know, she's this big.\n\n2:08:26.620 --> 2:08:28.820\n So you're the softy in the family, I'm just kidding.\n\n2:08:28.820 --> 2:08:32.220\n Well, you know, it's funny because my son said to me,\n\n2:08:32.220 --> 2:08:35.140\n my son's 21 now, he's a good kid, you know.\n\n2:08:35.140 --> 2:08:38.620\n And he says to me, back when he was like 12,\n\n2:08:38.620 --> 2:08:41.460\n he goes, dad, I don't want you to be offended\n\n2:08:41.460 --> 2:08:42.740\n but I'm really scared of mom,\n\n2:08:42.740 --> 2:08:44.220\n I'm not really that scared of you.\n\n2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:46.540\n And you know, like I cracked up because it's true,\n\n2:08:46.540 --> 2:08:49.500\n she's gotta stand on like a milk crate to reach him\n\n2:08:49.500 --> 2:08:51.580\n because you know, she's tiny and he's tall,\n\n2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:54.380\n but it's true, but you know, but she was hard but fair,\n\n2:08:54.380 --> 2:08:56.900\n but loved, that's, see, this is the thing,\n\n2:08:56.900 --> 2:09:01.900\n you take any child anywhere from any background,\n\n2:09:03.700 --> 2:09:05.620\n if you love them, you nurture them,\n\n2:09:05.620 --> 2:09:07.060\n you teach them and you guide them,\n\n2:09:07.060 --> 2:09:09.380\n you have a successful adult.\n\n2:09:09.380 --> 2:09:12.500\n And see, that's the problem in our society,\n\n2:09:12.500 --> 2:09:15.180\n it's not judgmental, I'm not judging anyone,\n\n2:09:15.180 --> 2:09:19.460\n but we need to try harder as parents\n\n2:09:19.460 --> 2:09:22.060\n as siblings, as friends,\n\n2:09:22.060 --> 2:09:26.260\n but especially when we're blessed with a child,\n\n2:09:26.260 --> 2:09:29.900\n it's like, you gotta put that child first,\n\n2:09:29.900 --> 2:09:32.500\n it's like being a military personal responder,\n\n2:09:32.500 --> 2:09:35.780\n it's not about you anymore, now it's the team.\n\n2:09:35.780 --> 2:09:39.180\n So that little child is now the team\n\n2:09:39.180 --> 2:09:42.140\n and you know, your wife or your significant other,\n\n2:09:42.140 --> 2:09:44.980\n you know, like it's not about you anymore.\n\n2:09:44.980 --> 2:09:48.900\n And see, that's the problem is people have a hard time\n\n2:09:48.900 --> 2:09:51.700\n not making it about them, you know,\n\n2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:55.300\n like now it's really weird, my kids are 19, 21 and 24\n\n2:09:55.300 --> 2:09:56.420\n and they hardly wanna hang with me\n\n2:09:56.420 --> 2:09:59.700\n because they're busy in their life, we love each other,\n\n2:09:59.700 --> 2:10:01.380\n they're probably tired of hearing me go on\n\n2:10:01.380 --> 2:10:03.020\n and you know, preach and whatever,\n\n2:10:03.020 --> 2:10:04.740\n but like, but they're adults,\n\n2:10:04.740 --> 2:10:08.420\n we did pretty much the crux of what we had to do\n\n2:10:08.420 --> 2:10:10.660\n to put them into adulthood.\n\n2:10:11.620 --> 2:10:13.380\n And I look back and I go, wow,\n\n2:10:13.380 --> 2:10:15.380\n I wish I didn't work so much and I wish,\n\n2:10:15.380 --> 2:10:17.340\n but then I say, no, but it was okay,\n\n2:10:17.340 --> 2:10:21.180\n my wife stayed home, good lessons, good, you know,\n\n2:10:21.180 --> 2:10:22.020\n just like.\n\n2:10:22.020 --> 2:10:24.700\n But ultimately, like you said, it's love.\n\n2:10:24.700 --> 2:10:27.260\n It is, it's the common,\n\n2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:31.460\n love is the most important ingredient on this earth\n\n2:10:31.460 --> 2:10:34.780\n and that's the problem what's going on right now,\n\n2:10:34.780 --> 2:10:37.620\n like take politics out of it, right?\n\n2:10:37.620 --> 2:10:40.020\n Take polarizing each other against each other,\n\n2:10:40.020 --> 2:10:41.980\n take all that crap out of it\n\n2:10:41.980 --> 2:10:45.620\n and just airdrop a bunch of love, right?\n\n2:10:45.620 --> 2:10:49.100\n Like when I worked on Rescuing Me, right?\n\n2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:51.300\n I love those people so much, they were such great,\n\n2:10:51.300 --> 2:10:53.300\n we had such a great crew and they worked so hard.\n\n2:10:53.300 --> 2:10:54.180\n You're a celebrity.\n\n2:10:54.180 --> 2:10:55.980\n No, no, no, not at all.\n\n2:10:55.980 --> 2:10:58.860\n If I was, it didn't really work out so good.\n\n2:10:58.860 --> 2:11:01.060\n I went on to be in the stagehand,\n\n2:11:01.060 --> 2:11:04.780\n no, I'm not pretty, but they don't want old guys\n\n2:11:04.780 --> 2:11:08.780\n waving bye bye hairdos, but it was funny,\n\n2:11:08.780 --> 2:11:10.340\n the crew, we became really tight,\n\n2:11:10.340 --> 2:11:14.860\n we had like, shoot, like 80, 90 people on a set, right?\n\n2:11:14.860 --> 2:11:17.620\n And you know, the first few episodes,\n\n2:11:17.620 --> 2:11:19.180\n everybody's trying to feel each other out\n\n2:11:19.180 --> 2:11:20.560\n because you know, you work with different crews,\n\n2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:24.220\n different people and this is going back,\n\n2:11:24.220 --> 2:11:27.260\n starting in 2004, so it was a different time\n\n2:11:27.260 --> 2:11:30.140\n and I love to hug people\n\n2:11:30.140 --> 2:11:33.500\n because to me, a hug is a true expression\n\n2:11:33.500 --> 2:11:35.540\n of love and caring.\n\n2:11:35.540 --> 2:11:37.140\n You may not know a person a long time,\n\n2:11:37.140 --> 2:11:38.820\n but you say, I care about you with a hug.\n\n2:11:38.820 --> 2:11:41.140\n Can I add just a tiny tangent?\n\n2:11:41.140 --> 2:11:44.860\n This was in the midst of COVID when I was in Boston\n\n2:11:44.860 --> 2:11:49.300\n and it was, you know, masks, like triple masks, nobody.\n\n2:11:49.300 --> 2:11:51.780\n And when I went to see Joe here\n\n2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:53.260\n when he was trying to convince me to move to Austin,\n\n2:11:53.260 --> 2:11:55.940\n Joe Rogan, and then the first time I see him,\n\n2:11:55.940 --> 2:11:59.420\n he's like, ah, you motherfucking big ass hug.\n\n2:11:59.420 --> 2:12:00.260\n And it felt so good.\n\n2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:02.140\n But people probably looked horrified.\n\n2:12:02.140 --> 2:12:02.980\n They're hugging.\n\n2:12:02.980 --> 2:12:04.500\n It was just him.\n\n2:12:04.500 --> 2:12:05.340\n Oh, okay, I know what I'm saying,\n\n2:12:05.340 --> 2:12:06.500\n but if you do it in public now,\n\n2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:07.820\n it's like you committed.\n\n2:12:07.820 --> 2:12:10.140\n But that expression, because I was so,\n\n2:12:10.140 --> 2:12:14.100\n you forget how powerful that is.\n\n2:12:14.100 --> 2:12:15.340\n Oh, I got some of my buddies.\n\n2:12:15.340 --> 2:12:19.620\n I give them a huge hug and a big sloppy kiss on their cheek\n\n2:12:19.620 --> 2:12:21.260\n and I, cause I love them.\n\n2:12:21.260 --> 2:12:23.140\n They, these are my brothers, you know?\n\n2:12:23.140 --> 2:12:27.140\n But on this set, I swear to God, it got to the point\n\n2:12:27.140 --> 2:12:28.100\n and I'm not trying to whatever,\n\n2:12:28.100 --> 2:12:30.140\n but there was people that would come up to me\n\n2:12:30.140 --> 2:12:31.740\n for the daily hug.\n\n2:12:31.740 --> 2:12:33.940\n And I said, what are you doing?\n\n2:12:33.940 --> 2:12:35.140\n And they said, come on, bring it in.\n\n2:12:35.140 --> 2:12:37.140\n And I give them the hug and they said, you don't understand.\n\n2:12:37.140 --> 2:12:39.140\n It just makes me feel so good.\n\n2:12:39.140 --> 2:12:41.100\n It makes me feel like you give a crap about me.\n\n2:12:41.100 --> 2:12:42.380\n I said, I really do.\n\n2:12:42.380 --> 2:12:44.380\n I said, but it touched my heart\n\n2:12:44.380 --> 2:12:46.500\n that people were seeking me out\n\n2:12:46.500 --> 2:12:48.540\n to get that hug to start the day.\n\n2:12:48.540 --> 2:12:50.060\n And I remember there was a guy in Manhattan,\n\n2:12:50.060 --> 2:12:51.900\n he was selling hugs for like 50 cents\n\n2:12:51.900 --> 2:12:53.020\n and I think he got arrested, right?\n\n2:12:53.020 --> 2:12:54.340\n It was just before COVID.\n\n2:12:54.340 --> 2:12:56.740\n But like, I wouldn't sell them if, but now.\n\n2:12:56.740 --> 2:12:57.580\n You've given them away for free.\n\n2:12:57.580 --> 2:12:58.420\n Well, now I got leukemia.\n\n2:12:58.420 --> 2:13:00.100\n I'd be kind of concerned to get into COVID.\n\n2:13:00.100 --> 2:13:03.540\n I mean, but like, I really think we need that.\n\n2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:06.500\n We need hugging booths, like in each city or each town.\n\n2:13:06.500 --> 2:13:08.860\n Like, because there's so many people\n\n2:13:08.860 --> 2:13:11.420\n that just want to know someone gives a shit about them.\n\n2:13:11.420 --> 2:13:12.260\n And that's the problem.\n\n2:13:12.260 --> 2:13:14.660\n It's like, like, you know,\n\n2:13:14.660 --> 2:13:17.220\n that's what I love about small little towns\n\n2:13:17.220 --> 2:13:19.620\n like where I am now in Tennessee.\n\n2:13:19.620 --> 2:13:20.940\n And I'm not knocking New York.\n\n2:13:20.940 --> 2:13:21.900\n I'm not knocking big towns,\n\n2:13:21.900 --> 2:13:23.900\n but I guess it's easier to do in a smaller area\n\n2:13:23.900 --> 2:13:26.940\n because it's just not this mass of humanity.\n\n2:13:26.940 --> 2:13:29.020\n But they'll stop and check on you.\n\n2:13:29.020 --> 2:13:30.620\n Like you're out in the road and you know,\n\n2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:32.660\n like I'm cutting and cleaning or whatever.\n\n2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:34.740\n Occasionally I'll roll a lawnmower or a tractor\n\n2:13:34.740 --> 2:13:37.540\n into a ditch cause I'm not a farmer, too good.\n\n2:13:37.540 --> 2:13:40.780\n But it's easier to drive a fire truck in New York.\n\n2:13:40.780 --> 2:13:42.940\n But they literally, oh, I was worried.\n\n2:13:42.940 --> 2:13:43.780\n I haven't seen you.\n\n2:13:43.780 --> 2:13:45.100\n And I'm like, no, no, I'm okay.\n\n2:13:45.100 --> 2:13:46.860\n But they literally like check on you.\n\n2:13:46.860 --> 2:13:47.860\n They're worried about you.\n\n2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:50.420\n And I'm going, these people hardly know me,\n\n2:13:50.420 --> 2:13:52.940\n but yet they're so caring.\n\n2:13:52.940 --> 2:13:54.540\n And that's the problem.\n\n2:13:54.540 --> 2:13:57.980\n Like this is what I love about my life.\n\n2:13:57.980 --> 2:14:00.460\n I spent a lot of time as, especially as a young boy\n\n2:14:00.460 --> 2:14:04.700\n and a lot of time in Ireland at my grandma's farm.\n\n2:14:04.700 --> 2:14:08.220\n And my mom comes from this tiny, tiny little village.\n\n2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:09.700\n She's out in the middle of nowhere.\n\n2:14:09.700 --> 2:14:12.700\n And the childhood home she grew up in still,\n\n2:14:12.700 --> 2:14:15.260\n my aunt and uncle live in it still.\n\n2:14:15.260 --> 2:14:16.660\n I just love it there so much.\n\n2:14:16.660 --> 2:14:17.700\n Cause everyone waves.\n\n2:14:17.700 --> 2:14:19.300\n Tennessee's similar.\n\n2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:21.140\n They wave, driving by and you're like,\n\n2:14:21.140 --> 2:14:21.980\n who the hell's that?\n\n2:14:21.980 --> 2:14:23.060\n I just wave, you know.\n\n2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:24.260\n But my cousin will point it out.\n\n2:14:24.260 --> 2:14:27.020\n Actually third cousin, second removed by, you know, Johnny.\n\n2:14:27.020 --> 2:14:29.860\n Like, holy shoot, I'm related to everyone here, right?\n\n2:14:29.860 --> 2:14:34.020\n But like everyone stops to say hello and how are you?\n\n2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:36.700\n And I have a problem doing that because my wife goes,\n\n2:14:36.700 --> 2:14:37.780\n people think you're crazy.\n\n2:14:37.780 --> 2:14:38.940\n Why are you talking to everybody?\n\n2:14:38.940 --> 2:14:42.180\n I said, like, I'll literally stop someone and say,\n\n2:14:42.180 --> 2:14:43.020\n how's your day going?\n\n2:14:43.020 --> 2:14:45.020\n Like, I mean, I'll randomly on the sidewalk.\n\n2:14:45.020 --> 2:14:45.900\n Then it looks a little nuts.\n\n2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:48.220\n But like, if I'm buying a cup of coffee.\n\n2:14:48.220 --> 2:14:50.180\n Oh, that happens here in Austin all the time.\n\n2:14:50.180 --> 2:14:53.220\n That's why I love it here on the sidewalk randomly.\n\n2:14:53.220 --> 2:14:54.780\n Yeah, no, it's just so nice.\n\n2:14:54.780 --> 2:14:55.820\n They'll say hi to me.\n\n2:14:55.820 --> 2:14:57.300\n I thought they recognized me or something.\n\n2:14:57.300 --> 2:14:58.420\n I don't give a shit who you are.\n\n2:14:58.420 --> 2:14:59.660\n They're just being nice.\n\n2:14:59.660 --> 2:15:03.180\n I was on the road coming back,\n\n2:15:03.180 --> 2:15:07.020\n driving from my family up north down to Tennessee last week.\n\n2:15:08.420 --> 2:15:13.300\n I stopped in a bathroom and it was closed.\n\n2:15:13.300 --> 2:15:15.300\n The girl was cleaning it, whatever.\n\n2:15:15.300 --> 2:15:16.700\n She's working so hard, whatever.\n\n2:15:16.700 --> 2:15:17.540\n And she goes, sir, she goes,\n\n2:15:17.540 --> 2:15:19.260\n if you go down the hall, there's a family restroom.\n\n2:15:19.260 --> 2:15:20.180\n Feel free to use it.\n\n2:15:20.180 --> 2:15:22.260\n You know, she didn't have to do that.\n\n2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:24.020\n And I went down and I'm old.\n\n2:15:24.020 --> 2:15:27.380\n You need a bathroom, you need a bathroom, right?\n\n2:15:27.380 --> 2:15:30.740\n And I walked back out and I said, ma'm,\n\n2:15:30.740 --> 2:15:32.220\n I said, I want to thank you for being here today.\n\n2:15:32.220 --> 2:15:33.900\n I says, the bathroom was immaculate.\n\n2:15:33.900 --> 2:15:37.100\n It was, it was like my army bathroom in the barracks.\n\n2:15:37.100 --> 2:15:39.700\n It was spotless, right?\n\n2:15:39.700 --> 2:15:41.260\n And I gave her $10.\n\n2:15:41.260 --> 2:15:43.140\n I said, I'd really like you to buy lunch with me today.\n\n2:15:43.140 --> 2:15:45.740\n I said, you really didn't have to do me that favor.\n\n2:15:45.740 --> 2:15:46.580\n And she goes, no, sir.\n\n2:15:46.580 --> 2:15:47.620\n I said, no, no.\n\n2:15:47.620 --> 2:15:48.700\n I said, I want.\n\n2:15:48.700 --> 2:15:50.860\n And it was like I gave her a million bucks.\n\n2:15:50.860 --> 2:15:52.900\n And I say to my wife now,\n\n2:15:52.900 --> 2:15:54.740\n I've been praying to be a billionaire.\n\n2:15:54.740 --> 2:15:55.620\n She goes, that's a sin.\n\n2:15:55.620 --> 2:15:57.460\n I said, no, no, you don't understand, right?\n\n2:15:57.460 --> 2:16:00.140\n She goes, oh, you're Mr., you know, Mr. God.\n\n2:16:00.140 --> 2:16:00.980\n I said, no, no, no.\n\n2:16:00.980 --> 2:16:01.820\n I said, you're getting it wrong.\n\n2:16:01.820 --> 2:16:04.900\n I said, I'm praying to be like a multi gazillionaire\n\n2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:07.060\n because I want to give it all away.\n\n2:16:07.060 --> 2:16:09.340\n We used to have a sign in ladder 114\n\n2:16:09.340 --> 2:16:11.780\n until some other rival truck company stole it, right?\n\n2:16:11.780 --> 2:16:12.620\n Cause that's what we do.\n\n2:16:12.620 --> 2:16:14.660\n You know, they get sent to cover your district\n\n2:16:14.660 --> 2:16:17.380\n when you're at a fire and now your stuff's missing.\n\n2:16:17.380 --> 2:16:20.940\n And the old timers had a sign that says, I am content.\n\n2:16:20.940 --> 2:16:23.620\n Because if you got to ladder 114,\n\n2:16:23.620 --> 2:16:25.860\n that was considered such a great place,\n\n2:16:25.860 --> 2:16:28.860\n such a great assignment, such great guys.\n\n2:16:28.860 --> 2:16:30.300\n You had to be vetted to get there.\n\n2:16:30.300 --> 2:16:31.700\n You couldn't just randomly go.\n\n2:16:31.700 --> 2:16:35.100\n And it was a little exclusionary, but they wanted good guys.\n\n2:16:36.220 --> 2:16:38.660\n And I said to myself, that's who I am in life right now.\n\n2:16:38.660 --> 2:16:42.620\n I am content, but I'm restless\n\n2:16:42.620 --> 2:16:44.980\n because I want to really do a lot more good.\n\n2:16:44.980 --> 2:16:46.820\n It's like this podcast.\n\n2:16:46.820 --> 2:16:50.060\n I want to make sure that it's not forgotten.\n\n2:16:50.060 --> 2:16:52.060\n And I want to make sure that these charities\n\n2:16:52.060 --> 2:16:55.700\n that are really, really helping people get recognized.\n\n2:16:55.700 --> 2:16:57.660\n But I'd like to take it a step further, right?\n\n2:16:57.660 --> 2:17:00.220\n A friend of mine runs this foundation\n\n2:17:00.220 --> 2:17:05.100\n for young folks suffering mental illness and in crisis.\n\n2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:08.460\n It's for someone that we love dearly.\n\n2:17:08.460 --> 2:17:13.460\n And he's on a mission now to get therapy dogs\n\n2:17:14.500 --> 2:17:18.660\n for really, really mentally wounded warriors, right?\n\n2:17:18.660 --> 2:17:23.260\n A lot of these young soldiers are having a really hard time.\n\n2:17:23.260 --> 2:17:25.460\n And now they could be out a while.\n\n2:17:25.460 --> 2:17:28.940\n They may have come back in country two, three years ago.\n\n2:17:28.940 --> 2:17:30.540\n Now it's just starting to set in.\n\n2:17:31.540 --> 2:17:34.820\n And there's a waiting list for thousands of therapy dogs.\n\n2:17:34.820 --> 2:17:39.460\n And he said that they can't get enough of them quick enough.\n\n2:17:39.460 --> 2:17:42.060\n But he said, when you see the response,\n\n2:17:42.060 --> 2:17:45.260\n the way these veterans just light up\n\n2:17:45.260 --> 2:17:46.300\n when they get these dogs,\n\n2:17:46.300 --> 2:17:50.180\n it just changes their life radically, immediately.\n\n2:17:50.180 --> 2:17:51.860\n And I said, that's it.\n\n2:17:51.860 --> 2:17:54.860\n God, I don't know how I'm going to do it,\n\n2:17:54.860 --> 2:17:57.060\n but I want to be a gazillionaire.\n\n2:17:57.060 --> 2:18:00.820\n And I don't want any picture, photo ops, this, that.\n\n2:18:00.820 --> 2:18:02.740\n I just want to go, there's a dog, there's a dog,\n\n2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:03.940\n there's a dog, there's a dog.\n\n2:18:03.940 --> 2:18:05.980\n And then I want to build veterans land\n\n2:18:05.980 --> 2:18:10.020\n for these vets who just need a nice clean place to live.\n\n2:18:10.020 --> 2:18:12.180\n So why don't we take these old army bases\n\n2:18:12.180 --> 2:18:15.980\n and Marine bases and Navy bases that have been shut down.\n\n2:18:15.980 --> 2:18:17.900\n They're just sitting there rotting away.\n\n2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:19.900\n I was in the army in Alabama.\n\n2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:23.420\n My old Fort McClellan is three quarters vacant.\n\n2:18:23.420 --> 2:18:24.260\n It's sitting there.\n\n2:18:24.260 --> 2:18:25.340\n They just did a documentary on it.\n\n2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:27.900\n It just looks like zombie land going back to zombies.\n\n2:18:27.900 --> 2:18:30.740\n So why don't we take that and renovate it\n\n2:18:30.740 --> 2:18:33.020\n and say to vets who are struggling,\n\n2:18:33.020 --> 2:18:35.300\n hey guys, you're going to live here.\n\n2:18:35.300 --> 2:18:39.660\n And they take the old army,\n\n2:18:39.660 --> 2:18:41.980\n the places where they had all the supplies,\n\n2:18:41.980 --> 2:18:44.860\n there's massive buildings where you could just retrofit it\n\n2:18:44.860 --> 2:18:48.580\n and make light manufacturing within two weeks.\n\n2:18:48.580 --> 2:18:49.700\n Give these guys jobs.\n\n2:18:49.700 --> 2:18:51.060\n There they live, there they work.\n\n2:18:51.060 --> 2:18:52.220\n They'll take care of it.\n\n2:18:52.220 --> 2:18:55.620\n Military guys, they teach you how to take care of stuff.\n\n2:18:55.620 --> 2:18:58.220\n How the hell in this country should any vet\n\n2:18:58.220 --> 2:19:00.660\n come back home and be homeless?\n\n2:19:00.660 --> 2:19:03.220\n Because now they have to dedicate their lives\n\n2:19:03.220 --> 2:19:05.140\n for six, seven, 10, 12 years,\n\n2:19:05.140 --> 2:19:09.540\n five, six deployments making $7.50 an hour.\n\n2:19:09.540 --> 2:19:10.940\n And then they spend seven years\n\n2:19:10.940 --> 2:19:13.540\n or they get a whopping $16 an hour.\n\n2:19:13.540 --> 2:19:16.580\n They walk out making 35 grand.\n\n2:19:16.580 --> 2:19:18.820\n And now no one gives them a job.\n\n2:19:18.820 --> 2:19:20.260\n No one gives them a chance.\n\n2:19:20.260 --> 2:19:22.340\n So very quickly they end up homeless\n\n2:19:23.380 --> 2:19:24.740\n by no fault of their own.\n\n2:19:25.940 --> 2:19:28.980\n And I don't know how that's even possible.\n\n2:19:28.980 --> 2:19:31.660\n The people in this country who've given the very most\n\n2:19:32.980 --> 2:19:35.260\n and they're struggling, they're hurting.\n\n2:19:35.260 --> 2:19:36.100\n That's not fair.\n\n2:19:36.100 --> 2:19:39.460\n And my whole thing is if I can have this dream\n\n2:19:39.460 --> 2:19:43.620\n of succeeding, so to speak, I want to try to change it.\n\n2:19:45.940 --> 2:19:48.460\n So that's why I'm praying to be a billionaire.\n\n2:19:48.460 --> 2:19:52.500\n My Irish mother probably wouldn't agree either\n\n2:19:52.500 --> 2:19:53.980\n because you're not supposed to, right?\n\n2:19:53.980 --> 2:19:56.420\n Well, I'm the same with you.\n\n2:19:56.420 --> 2:19:59.300\n The more money you have, the more you're able to help.\n\n2:19:59.300 --> 2:20:02.860\n Yeah, you can put smiles on people's faces.\n\n2:20:02.860 --> 2:20:07.100\n I have to ask you, the US invaded Afghanistan\n\n2:20:07.100 --> 2:20:11.420\n in October, 2001 in response to terror attacks.\n\n2:20:11.420 --> 2:20:14.140\n Now 20 years later, we still had a presence\n\n2:20:14.140 --> 2:20:17.340\n and abruptly withdrew all troops.\n\n2:20:17.340 --> 2:20:20.460\n What do you think about this war across the world\n\n2:20:20.460 --> 2:20:23.380\n that was sparked by this tragedy?\n\n2:20:23.380 --> 2:20:26.900\n Whenever you do something quickly without thinking it out,\n\n2:20:26.900 --> 2:20:30.260\n thinking it through and planning, it doesn't succeed.\n\n2:20:31.500 --> 2:20:34.140\n I understand that we needed to exit.\n\n2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:36.860\n I mean, how long were you gonna stay over there?\n\n2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:41.380\n And we've lost over 7,000 of our young souls over there.\n\n2:20:43.100 --> 2:20:45.100\n For sometimes people, I don't know if they're grateful\n\n2:20:45.100 --> 2:20:46.220\n for it or not, right?\n\n2:20:46.220 --> 2:20:48.660\n I mean, I don't know.\n\n2:20:48.660 --> 2:20:51.620\n So there's the other element, and sorry to interrupt.\n\n2:20:51.620 --> 2:20:55.220\n One is the financial of $6 trillion\n\n2:20:55.220 --> 2:20:59.460\n and that money is not just money, it's education,\n\n2:20:59.460 --> 2:21:03.860\n it's everything, it's money that could have gone towards,\n\n2:21:03.860 --> 2:21:05.580\n first of all, the first responders,\n\n2:21:05.580 --> 2:21:08.780\n but all the servicemen and women of all kinds\n\n2:21:08.780 --> 2:21:10.060\n throughout this country.\n\n2:21:10.060 --> 2:21:12.020\n And then there's the other side,\n\n2:21:12.020 --> 2:21:15.260\n which is the over 800,000 people who died\n\n2:21:15.260 --> 2:21:18.420\n in direct result of this conflict.\n\n2:21:18.420 --> 2:21:21.260\n So not just the American side of the troops,\n\n2:21:21.260 --> 2:21:24.180\n but just people who died, those humans.\n\n2:21:24.180 --> 2:21:29.180\n And those humans, many of them civilians,\n\n2:21:30.980 --> 2:21:34.980\n that's spreading hate, especially if you have leaders\n\n2:21:34.980 --> 2:21:38.500\n on the other side who frame the death of those civilians\n\n2:21:38.500 --> 2:21:41.780\n in certain ways that just spreads hate throughout the world.\n\n2:21:41.780 --> 2:21:46.220\n And so you think about this kind of 20 year saga\n\n2:21:46.220 --> 2:21:51.220\n and think, what are the ways that money could be spent better\n\n2:21:51.420 --> 2:21:55.020\n and what was the way that we could have spread more love\n\n2:21:55.020 --> 2:21:56.780\n in the world versus hate?\n\n2:21:56.780 --> 2:22:01.300\n And you wonder, but then the other side, what is it?\n\n2:22:01.300 --> 2:22:04.780\n I'm not sure who says this line,\n\n2:22:04.780 --> 2:22:08.620\n but it's something like we sleep at night\n\n2:22:08.620 --> 2:22:11.460\n because there's a rough men out there\n\n2:22:11.460 --> 2:22:13.780\n ready to fight for you.\n\n2:22:15.100 --> 2:22:18.260\n There is some sense in which we have to make sure\n\n2:22:18.260 --> 2:22:21.180\n that there's strength coupled with the love, right?\n\n2:22:21.180 --> 2:22:26.180\n Otherwise evil men will do evil onto the world.\n\n2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:29.580\n So it's a very difficult decision,\n\n2:22:29.580 --> 2:22:31.980\n but then you look at the final picture\n\n2:22:31.980 --> 2:22:35.340\n and it's like, what have we gotten for this $6 trillion?\n\n2:22:35.340 --> 2:22:37.700\n What have we gotten for this 20 years?\n\n2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:41.220\n The thousands of American soldiers who died,\n\n2:22:41.220 --> 2:22:45.880\n the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have died.\n\n2:22:49.300 --> 2:22:53.620\n You know, it's a troubling subject for me.\n\n2:22:53.620 --> 2:22:55.700\n I'm a patriot, I love this country.\n\n2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:58.180\n I love it with my soul.\n\n2:22:58.180 --> 2:23:02.900\n And I was just about to head over to the first Iraqi war\n\n2:23:02.900 --> 2:23:04.820\n and we went out for desert warfare training\n\n2:23:04.820 --> 2:23:06.220\n and then it ended.\n\n2:23:06.220 --> 2:23:08.500\n I was at that time a combat medic assigned\n\n2:23:08.500 --> 2:23:09.660\n to an armored cav unit.\n\n2:23:09.660 --> 2:23:11.940\n So basically tanks driving around\n\n2:23:11.940 --> 2:23:14.100\n an armored personnel carrier and when it gets hit,\n\n2:23:14.100 --> 2:23:17.560\n then you tend to that guy, try to save his life.\n\n2:23:18.500 --> 2:23:19.780\n I didn't wanna go.\n\n2:23:19.780 --> 2:23:23.500\n I may sound like a coward, I did not wanna go to war.\n\n2:23:23.500 --> 2:23:26.860\n I would have went willingly if I was sent\n\n2:23:26.860 --> 2:23:28.760\n to defend my country, I took my oath.\n\n2:23:30.060 --> 2:23:32.940\n I didn't join the military to kill,\n\n2:23:32.940 --> 2:23:34.740\n but if necessary, I would.\n\n2:23:36.440 --> 2:23:38.080\n I'll use the analogy of cancer.\n\n2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:42.220\n If you have a cancer and you're aware of its presence\n\n2:23:42.220 --> 2:23:44.140\n and you don't annihilate those cells\n\n2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:48.740\n and take them out quickly, it's gonna spread\n\n2:23:48.740 --> 2:23:49.940\n and it's gonna kill you.\n\n2:23:51.540 --> 2:23:55.500\n Those evil bastards that flew those airplanes,\n\n2:23:55.500 --> 2:23:57.580\n one of those airplanes had a little three year old child\n\n2:23:57.580 --> 2:24:00.240\n in it from Ireland where my mom's hometown.\n\n2:24:01.140 --> 2:24:03.100\n A friend of mine who since died of a heart attack\n\n2:24:03.100 --> 2:24:05.820\n from 9 11 toxins, he found her shoe\n\n2:24:05.820 --> 2:24:07.060\n with human remains in it.\n\n2:24:08.500 --> 2:24:09.940\n And he thought someone was messing with us\n\n2:24:09.940 --> 2:24:12.180\n because we didn't know there was any kids in the building.\n\n2:24:12.180 --> 2:24:15.060\n He says, boss, there's a baby shoe\n\n2:24:15.060 --> 2:24:16.980\n and it looks like there's something in it,\n\n2:24:16.980 --> 2:24:18.340\n but there's no kids in the trade center.\n\n2:24:18.340 --> 2:24:21.860\n I went, the plane, it's a little girl shoe.\n\n2:24:21.860 --> 2:24:25.100\n I can never get that shoe out of my mind.\n\n2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:28.720\n The evil bastards who perpetrated that\n\n2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:32.240\n needed to have missiles strike and rain down upon them\n\n2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:35.080\n and annihilate them like a cancer that they are.\n\n2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:38.440\n What just fascinates me is they'll show videos\n\n2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:40.720\n of these guys flying around and pick up trucks\n\n2:24:40.720 --> 2:24:41.960\n with 50 cows on the back.\n\n2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:43.280\n It's like, well, wait a minute.\n\n2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:45.800\n If a camera crew can get this footage,\n\n2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:48.960\n you think all these freaking drones and planes\n\n2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:52.360\n and radar assisted systems can't just go\n\n2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:56.320\n whist, whist, whist, goodnight, you're gone.\n\n2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:00.280\n So kill the cancer, kill the cells, get rid of it,\n\n2:25:00.280 --> 2:25:03.760\n get rid of it quickly and go into remission.\n\n2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:08.120\n Like an undeniable show of force that sends a message\n\n2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:13.120\n that gets rid of most of the obvious centers of terrorism.\n\n2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:17.160\n And that note, that's though,\n\n2:25:17.160 --> 2:25:20.040\n because we offline mentioned a discussion with Jaco\n\n2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:25.040\n and maybe romanticize view and mentioning brothers in arms\n\n2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:29.800\n by dire straits and saying we're all brothers in arms\n\n2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:32.380\n even when it's on the opposite side of fighting,\n\n2:25:32.380 --> 2:25:35.720\n which is more of a vision and growing up in the Soviet Union\n\n2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:39.520\n you saw about World War II, that it's all just kids\n\n2:25:39.520 --> 2:25:43.200\n thrown into the kids sent to die in all sides.\n\n2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:48.200\n But then presenting that to Jaco who was in Iraq,\n\n2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:55.240\n he did not see as brothers in arms,\n\n2:25:55.240 --> 2:26:00.240\n which is his basic statement is there's evil people\n\n2:26:00.740 --> 2:26:03.880\n and some people don't deserve the compassion.\n\n2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:05.240\n You give them a few chances,\n\n2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:07.480\n they don't take the chances they have to go\n\n2:26:07.480 --> 2:26:09.880\n because they're spreading evil onto the world.\n\n2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:14.280\n And so it's not, we're not, all of us deserve a chance.\n\n2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:16.800\n Oh no, absolutely, but the difference though,\n\n2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:21.800\n and believe me, I, Jaco, I am from a way, way minor league\n\n2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:22.860\n compared to him, right?\n\n2:26:22.860 --> 2:26:25.400\n I mean, this man was right there in the firing line,\n\n2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:28.080\n but I can understand his analogy\n\n2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:29.200\n because when you think about it, right,\n\n2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:31.840\n those young conscripts back in Germany and Russia\n\n2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:34.040\n and all the countries where they were being drafted,\n\n2:26:34.040 --> 2:26:37.320\n even our guys were being drafted and thrown into this.\n\n2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:42.320\n They were gallantly and bravely defending their country.\n\n2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:47.060\n Now, I'm sure the young Germans felt,\n\n2:26:47.060 --> 2:26:49.500\n well, hey, Hitler must be right, right?\n\n2:26:49.500 --> 2:26:51.840\n And young Russians felt, hey, Stalin must be right.\n\n2:26:51.840 --> 2:26:54.640\n And the young Americans figured,\n\n2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:57.200\n hey, President Roosevelt must be right.\n\n2:26:57.200 --> 2:27:00.640\n So they were romantically in a sense\n\n2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:04.500\n defending the honor of their country, of their motherland.\n\n2:27:04.500 --> 2:27:06.440\n The difference between those,\n\n2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:08.120\n so they did have that commonality.\n\n2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:10.540\n If you and I were firing across each other\n\n2:27:10.540 --> 2:27:12.840\n from France to Germany or, you know,\n\n2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:14.820\n from Germany to Russia or whatever,\n\n2:27:14.820 --> 2:27:17.100\n we're just these two kids who got thrown into this.\n\n2:27:17.100 --> 2:27:19.320\n We didn't freaking ask for this, right?\n\n2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:21.620\n But the difference with Jaco's enemy is\n\n2:27:22.700 --> 2:27:26.480\n no one was attacking their country over there, right?\n\n2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:28.600\n No one was taking their country over.\n\n2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:31.000\n Maybe in their mind, they didn't want people\n\n2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.120\n trying to build their government, this and that.\n\n2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:35.480\n I don't know, I don't know enough about the history there\n\n2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:37.020\n to really elaborate.\n\n2:27:38.680 --> 2:27:40.100\n We didn't attack them.\n\n2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:44.240\n And if a soldier attacks a soldier,\n\n2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:47.360\n that's an understood concept amongst warriors.\n\n2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:49.680\n But when a soldier attacks a civilian,\n\n2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:51.960\n now you're after a different beast,\n\n2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:54.720\n and you've written that beast off, if that makes any sense.\n\n2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:59.280\n Yeah, and the enemy, I mean, as Jaco explains,\n\n2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:03.940\n the enemy in Iraq and just certain parts of the Middle East\n\n2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:08.940\n is essentially terrorists who don't value the lives\n\n2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:11.800\n of the civilians of their own country.\n\n2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:12.640\n They don't.\n\n2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:15.480\n And so it becomes like this weird guerrilla warfare\n\n2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:20.160\n slash game of violence that ultimately allows them\n\n2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:22.340\n to gain more power within their country,\n\n2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:24.740\n but they don't care if they're playing\n\n2:28:24.740 --> 2:28:26.920\n with civilian lives as pawns.\n\n2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:29.080\n If you have a child who dies\n\n2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:33.840\n that's a civilian in their country,\n\n2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:35.720\n that could be seen as a positive for them\n\n2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:37.440\n because they can use that to leverage\n\n2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:40.920\n for more and more power within that country.\n\n2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:44.100\n So when you're fighting an enemy like that,\n\n2:28:44.100 --> 2:28:46.200\n that's a vicious, that's an evil enemy.\n\n2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:47.100\n Absolutely.\n\n2:28:47.100 --> 2:28:48.840\n It's like snakes are beautiful,\n\n2:28:48.840 --> 2:28:50.400\n but if you go pet a rattler,\n\n2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:52.700\n you're getting bit and you're getting dead, right?\n\n2:28:52.700 --> 2:28:53.880\n And that's with terrorists,\n\n2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:55.880\n you've got to cut the head of the snake off.\n\n2:28:55.880 --> 2:28:59.280\n And I feel, no, don't commit our guys to be there anymore.\n\n2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:01.800\n But what we need to do is go with tech warfare.\n\n2:29:01.800 --> 2:29:05.140\n If we have intel from drones or planes or whatever it is\n\n2:29:05.140 --> 2:29:07.480\n that so and so and so and so and so and so\n\n2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:09.560\n are driving down in that pickup or whatever,\n\n2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:11.840\n take it out and do it again tomorrow\n\n2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:12.760\n and tomorrow and tomorrow.\n\n2:29:12.760 --> 2:29:15.680\n And maybe they'll get the message after a while,\n\n2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:17.960\n oh shit, these guys aren't messing around.\n\n2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:21.160\n Instead of throwing wave after wave of our brave warriors,\n\n2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:24.780\n brave SEALs, brave special ops guys,\n\n2:29:24.780 --> 2:29:27.840\n and God bless them for what they do, I couldn't do it.\n\n2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:29.340\n I could not have done it.\n\n2:29:29.340 --> 2:29:33.200\n But they have to be now sitting home going,\n\n2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:35.580\n what the hell?\n\n2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:38.960\n My friends, my body, myself,\n\n2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:41.420\n like they must feel so betrayed\n\n2:29:41.420 --> 2:29:43.960\n because they passionately went over there\n\n2:29:43.960 --> 2:29:47.120\n to cure a cancer, the cancer of terrorism.\n\n2:29:48.040 --> 2:29:49.640\n And now the cancer is back.\n\n2:29:50.680 --> 2:29:51.600\n And I hate to say it,\n\n2:29:51.600 --> 2:29:54.320\n but I think the cancer might start running wild.\n\n2:29:54.320 --> 2:29:55.840\n We need to change our tactics up.\n\n2:29:55.840 --> 2:29:57.040\n This is just my opinion.\n\n2:29:57.040 --> 2:30:00.440\n I can't see committing all of our guys\n\n2:30:00.440 --> 2:30:04.240\n to a continuous eternal war.\n\n2:30:04.240 --> 2:30:07.180\n But I think what we need to do is hit surgically\n\n2:30:07.180 --> 2:30:11.200\n and hit hard at that cancer that is over there.\n\n2:30:11.200 --> 2:30:13.180\n We are never gonna rebuild that region.\n\n2:30:14.200 --> 2:30:17.280\n It's just, it's thousands of years of traditions\n\n2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:18.760\n that you're not going to change.\n\n2:30:18.760 --> 2:30:22.120\n It's just some people are unchangeable\n\n2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:23.520\n because they don't want to.\n\n2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:27.840\n And we have so many social problems here in our country,\n\n2:30:27.840 --> 2:30:29.800\n I think that we need to fix first.\n\n2:30:31.400 --> 2:30:33.960\n I heard this spoken in the past by many people.\n\n2:30:33.960 --> 2:30:35.720\n It's like the garden theory.\n\n2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:37.920\n You have your garden with a fence around it.\n\n2:30:37.920 --> 2:30:39.200\n You tend to your garden.\n\n2:30:39.200 --> 2:30:41.320\n There may be weeds on the outside of the fence,\n\n2:30:41.320 --> 2:30:43.800\n but as long as they're not inside your garden,\n\n2:30:43.800 --> 2:30:45.720\n your garden will prosper.\n\n2:30:45.720 --> 2:30:49.640\n And I know some people don't agree to that America first\n\n2:30:49.640 --> 2:30:52.240\n and the whole take care of our own,\n\n2:30:52.240 --> 2:30:56.960\n but it's like, how are we gonna take in more people now?\n\n2:30:56.960 --> 2:31:01.320\n And I have a human feeling for them,\n\n2:31:01.320 --> 2:31:03.520\n but it's almost like the lifeboat theory.\n\n2:31:03.520 --> 2:31:05.840\n How many people can we take into the lifeboat\n\n2:31:05.840 --> 2:31:10.140\n before the lifeboat itself sinks as the ship is going down?\n\n2:31:10.140 --> 2:31:13.680\n So if we can't take care of our own homeless vets\n\n2:31:13.680 --> 2:31:15.800\n and our own homeless people,\n\n2:31:15.800 --> 2:31:20.040\n and it's just gonna become worse.\n\n2:31:20.040 --> 2:31:21.840\n And it doesn't make any sense.\n\n2:31:21.840 --> 2:31:25.200\n It's just like, we need to just take a timeout\n\n2:31:25.200 --> 2:31:29.840\n and I think switch our tactics a little bit.\n\n2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:33.320\n And invest into helping people here at home.\n\n2:31:33.320 --> 2:31:35.520\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:38.880\n There's very few as obvious of cases\n\n2:31:38.880 --> 2:31:41.200\n as the first responders in 9 11.\n\n2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:47.400\n That one of the things that I really wanna kind of talk about\n\n2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:48.720\n at least a little bit,\n\n2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:51.320\n we've already talked about the amazing project\n\n2:31:51.320 --> 2:31:56.320\n that you're doing the 20 for 20 podcast that you host.\n\n2:31:56.640 --> 2:31:59.340\n We mentioned one story, Steven Siller,\n\n2:31:59.340 --> 2:32:00.920\n is there other stories\n\n2:32:00.920 --> 2:32:02.800\n or maybe you can speak out at a high level,\n\n2:32:02.800 --> 2:32:04.520\n what are you hoping to tell?\n\n2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:07.160\n And all these different stories that are weaved\n\n2:32:07.160 --> 2:32:12.160\n about that connect the tragedies and the triumphs,\n\n2:32:14.280 --> 2:32:16.800\n the heroism of that day\n\n2:32:16.800 --> 2:32:19.400\n and the days and the years that followed.\n\n2:32:19.400 --> 2:32:22.160\n You know, Lex, it seems like the common few themes,\n\n2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:26.940\n the common threads are being selfless,\n\n2:32:26.940 --> 2:32:29.820\n helping out others even though they might be a stranger,\n\n2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:34.520\n in acts of kindness, acts of love,\n\n2:32:34.520 --> 2:32:37.380\n and it seems to all be weaved together with faith.\n\n2:32:37.380 --> 2:32:39.920\n They all seem to have some sort of faith.\n\n2:32:39.920 --> 2:32:44.080\n I mean, we have one gentleman, Mark Hanna,\n\n2:32:44.080 --> 2:32:47.240\n and he's a Coptic Egyptian priest,\n\n2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:49.320\n and he's an immigrant to the United States.\n\n2:32:49.320 --> 2:32:51.720\n He was a port authority building engineer.\n\n2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:56.060\n And with his crew who subsequently passed away,\n\n2:32:56.060 --> 2:33:00.000\n the crew did, he was effectively rescuing dozens of people\n\n2:33:00.000 --> 2:33:01.520\n on the upper floors,\n\n2:33:01.520 --> 2:33:04.400\n and his boss ordered him to assist an elderly gentleman\n\n2:33:04.400 --> 2:33:09.400\n who was 89 down 78 flights of stairs to get him out.\n\n2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:12.440\n And in stopping on the 21st floor,\n\n2:33:12.440 --> 2:33:14.880\n he figured they would just wait there for medics.\n\n2:33:14.880 --> 2:33:18.880\n He came across Captain Patty Brown of Ladder Company 3,\n\n2:33:18.880 --> 2:33:21.800\n who told him, no, sir, you need to evacuate.\n\n2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:23.940\n And Captain Brown picked his brain a little bit\n\n2:33:23.940 --> 2:33:25.760\n about the structure because he figured,\n\n2:33:25.760 --> 2:33:27.880\n found out he was an engineer.\n\n2:33:27.880 --> 2:33:30.920\n And Captain Patty Brown continued on to effect rescues,\n\n2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:32.920\n and he and his crew were killed.\n\n2:33:32.920 --> 2:33:34.600\n But father, he's now,\n\n2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:38.880\n Mark was able to effectively evacuate this gentleman.\n\n2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:40.840\n They were the two known last survivors\n\n2:33:40.840 --> 2:33:42.520\n to come out of the tower.\n\n2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:45.960\n He now has dedicated his life to becoming a Coptic priest\n\n2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:49.520\n in St. Mary's Church in East Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\n2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:51.240\n He did this for a total stranger.\n\n2:33:51.240 --> 2:33:55.960\n And he said he was inspired by his bosses who died\n\n2:33:55.960 --> 2:33:58.080\n and his friends.\n\n2:33:58.080 --> 2:33:59.960\n One of his best friends was an Italian man.\n\n2:33:59.960 --> 2:34:03.520\n The other man was a retired Navy SEAL, Hispanic man.\n\n2:34:03.520 --> 2:34:05.540\n And they were part of this melting pot.\n\n2:34:05.540 --> 2:34:07.320\n And no one looked at each other that day,\n\n2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:09.280\n what color, what race, what belief are you?\n\n2:34:09.280 --> 2:34:12.460\n They just said, hey, you're a human in need, let's go.\n\n2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:16.360\n And we have the story about John Field\n\n2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:18.840\n on his mission to help the responders.\n\n2:34:19.680 --> 2:34:21.000\n We have a young lady, Mariah,\n\n2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:24.460\n whose birth father was on flight 93.\n\n2:34:24.460 --> 2:34:26.160\n She had not even met him.\n\n2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:28.760\n And she had this premonition that somebody in her family\n\n2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:29.680\n was killed that day.\n\n2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:33.680\n And her adopted mom said, no, everyone's fine.\n\n2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:35.920\n Three years later, when she was legally able\n\n2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:37.320\n to find out who her dad was,\n\n2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:40.600\n she found out that her dad, Tom, was actually on that plane\n\n2:34:40.600 --> 2:34:43.040\n as part of the Let's Roll team.\n\n2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:46.280\n And we have a gentleman, Robert Burke,\n\n2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:49.480\n who's an actor, sweetheart of a man.\n\n2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:52.880\n He's a gentleman and he's a very, very popular actor\n\n2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:53.720\n in Hollywood.\n\n2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:56.080\n He was on Rescue Me, Blue Bloods, Gossip Girls.\n\n2:34:56.080 --> 2:34:58.800\n And Bobby, my friend, as I call him,\n\n2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:01.360\n is a volunteer fireman now.\n\n2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:02.800\n This man doesn't need to get out of bed\n\n2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:05.320\n at two oclock in the morning and help people with a stroke\n\n2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:07.240\n or a burning garage or a burning house,\n\n2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:09.520\n but he does because he wants to.\n\n2:35:09.520 --> 2:35:12.160\n Because his best friend was Captain Patty Brown.\n\n2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:14.520\n And his other best friend was Father Michael Judge,\n\n2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:16.840\n who was our chaplain, who was killed,\n\n2:35:16.840 --> 2:35:20.320\n literally blessing the victims at the site,\n\n2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:22.400\n had just given last rites to the firefighter\n\n2:35:22.400 --> 2:35:24.800\n I mentioned earlier, Danny, who was killed.\n\n2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:26.920\n And Father Judge was in the lobby of the building,\n\n2:35:26.920 --> 2:35:30.280\n giving a blessing, praying to God to please stop this.\n\n2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:33.440\n And he was struck by debris and he was killed.\n\n2:35:33.440 --> 2:35:37.560\n And Bobby goes on to elaborate about Father Judge's story.\n\n2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:39.840\n Father Judge used to walk the streets of New York City,\n\n2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:42.680\n helping AIDS patients just with whatever they needed.\n\n2:35:42.680 --> 2:35:45.000\n And he was a Franciscan friar.\n\n2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:46.920\n They wear sandals and a robe.\n\n2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:49.880\n They just live very humble lives.\n\n2:35:50.800 --> 2:35:55.080\n And it's just a common denominator is loving each other\n\n2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:57.400\n and helping each other,\n\n2:35:57.400 --> 2:36:00.160\n regardless of you know the person or not.\n\n2:36:00.160 --> 2:36:01.920\n And really, when you think about it,\n\n2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:03.680\n that's how America was made.\n\n2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:06.040\n We fought for independence.\n\n2:36:06.040 --> 2:36:11.040\n Stranger fought next to stranger and fought tyranny\n\n2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.680\n because they wanted freedom.\n\n2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:18.680\n They wanted to be able to live, love, pray and prosper.\n\n2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:22.720\n And they fought and died alongside of strangers.\n\n2:36:22.720 --> 2:36:25.400\n And it's sort of symbolic of what happened that day.\n\n2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:27.800\n And then strangers from around this great country\n\n2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:31.640\n just flocked in by the thousands to help.\n\n2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:34.320\n They didn't know who was in that pile, but they didn't care.\n\n2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:36.400\n That was another American.\n\n2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:38.600\n And what I ultimately am trying to do\n\n2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:41.120\n involved in this beautiful project\n\n2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:46.120\n is spread the message of doing the right thing.\n\n2:36:46.280 --> 2:36:48.720\n Look at these examples.\n\n2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:51.680\n These brave people who didn't have to,\n\n2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:53.000\n especially the civilians,\n\n2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:55.120\n they weren't paid to run back in there\n\n2:36:55.120 --> 2:36:56.840\n and help person after person.\n\n2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:59.080\n And they had no obligation.\n\n2:36:59.080 --> 2:36:59.920\n They could have just said,\n\n2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:02.080\n hey man, I'm out of here and just bolted.\n\n2:37:02.080 --> 2:37:04.160\n But they didn't.\n\n2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:07.920\n So we're just trying to say to people,\n\n2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:11.640\n let's bring back that unity and that feeling of 912.\n\n2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:13.880\n As strange as 912 of a day it was,\n\n2:37:13.880 --> 2:37:18.800\n it was so sad because it was the first dawn of the sun\n\n2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:21.600\n where we realized this wasn't a dream.\n\n2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:24.560\n This was real and it's not going away.\n\n2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:27.240\n But the beauty of it was there was thousands of people\n\n2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:28.840\n lined up along the West Side Highway\n\n2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:32.040\n with signs and American flags.\n\n2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:34.080\n And they were from every country\n\n2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:36.680\n and every race and every creed.\n\n2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:38.720\n And it didn't matter who they were,\n\n2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:42.080\n but they all shared one bond, love.\n\n2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:47.080\n And they were hugging and crying and thanking rescuers.\n\n2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:51.080\n And it brought the morale so high\n\n2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:55.400\n for a group of people that was so beaten down the day before.\n\n2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:57.120\n It just started lifting the morale\n\n2:37:57.120 --> 2:37:59.600\n and making us realize, you know what?\n\n2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:01.680\n People really do give a crap.\n\n2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:04.120\n They really do love each other.\n\n2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:05.600\n And now I'm gonna be honest with you,\n\n2:38:05.600 --> 2:38:08.240\n I've been doubting that a little bit lately.\n\n2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:09.920\n I still have these examples of it.\n\n2:38:09.920 --> 2:38:12.640\n You know, that lady who helped me last night with the phone\n\n2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:15.120\n and just, you know, I know there's these shining\n\n2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:17.320\n little examples, but sometimes I think,\n\n2:38:18.200 --> 2:38:20.520\n I don't know, are we running out of them?\n\n2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:22.920\n Well, I gotta give you some advice.\n\n2:38:22.920 --> 2:38:25.680\n So there's two words that were repeated often\n\n2:38:27.080 --> 2:38:30.720\n in the days and the years after 911, which is never forget.\n\n2:38:30.720 --> 2:38:35.720\n So might I remind you to never forget about 912.\n\n2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:39.080\n I mean, those words, you talked about that, you know,\n\n2:38:39.080 --> 2:38:43.200\n there's people, what is it, college freshmen, maybe.\n\n2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:44.160\n They weren't even born.\n\n2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:45.160\n They weren't even born.\n\n2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:47.360\n And there's people in the 20s that were too young\n\n2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:51.080\n to remember or to understand the events of that day.\n\n2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:53.840\n But I think what that day, as you're describing, means,\n\n2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:55.680\n it's not about a terrorist attack.\n\n2:38:55.680 --> 2:38:58.640\n It's about the unity that followed.\n\n2:38:58.640 --> 2:38:59.880\n It was tremendous, Lex.\n\n2:38:59.880 --> 2:39:01.160\n I never felt so proud.\n\n2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:03.440\n I was always proud of this country.\n\n2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:05.520\n You know, I remember my grandpa Nels used to walk by,\n\n2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:07.600\n I'd see a flag, I'd hear the Star Spangled Banner\n\n2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:08.680\n and he'd tear up and I'd say,\n\n2:39:08.680 --> 2:39:10.000\n Grant, why are you crying?\n\n2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.720\n He said, I'm not crying, it's the tears of joy.\n\n2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:15.160\n I love this country so much.\n\n2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:17.320\n And I just remember like feeling that way.\n\n2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:19.520\n I felt that way 910.\n\n2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:22.560\n I felt that way on 911, but then on 912,\n\n2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:25.200\n I was just so proud of just the people,\n\n2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:27.280\n the way they stepped up.\n\n2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:29.840\n And I just want to try to see if that can happen again.\n\n2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:33.080\n And I hope it's not necessary for us to have another tragedy\n\n2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:34.760\n to bring that about.\n\n2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:37.040\n Let's do that without the tragedy.\n\n2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:40.640\n Let's just stop and say, hey, you know what?\n\n2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:43.440\n Let me listen to what this guy has to say.\n\n2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:45.440\n And maybe he's, he probably won't convince me,\n\n2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:47.080\n but maybe I'll go, well, you know,\n\n2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:49.000\n I never thought of it that way.\n\n2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:52.200\n Stop the finger pointing, the bickering,\n\n2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:54.560\n the tantrums, the fighting.\n\n2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:55.760\n It's just not necessary.\n\n2:39:55.760 --> 2:39:56.880\n It gets you nowhere, right?\n\n2:39:56.880 --> 2:39:58.640\n It's like, you know, I was two years old\n\n2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:00.400\n and I'd stomp around because I wanted a cookie\n\n2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:01.280\n or a piece of candy.\n\n2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:03.000\n I still didn't get it, right?\n\n2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:05.000\n You know, turned blue in the face and whatever,\n\n2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:06.160\n got a little swat in the rear end,\n\n2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:07.920\n but it didn't get the candy.\n\n2:40:07.920 --> 2:40:09.440\n And that's what we got going on right now.\n\n2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:12.280\n Everybody's just stomping around, being a baby.\n\n2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:13.960\n Stop, just stop.\n\n2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:14.800\n We're really lucky.\n\n2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:16.800\n Look, the country's not perfect, right?\n\n2:40:17.640 --> 2:40:19.880\n You know, but it's damn good.\n\n2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:22.400\n It gives us all these opportunities, you know?\n\n2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:24.120\n Like I said, no one's rushing out the gates\n\n2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:25.040\n to get out of here.\n\n2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:27.360\n They're freaking, I got a cousin of mine.\n\n2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:28.200\n I love him dearly.\n\n2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:30.360\n My cousin Tony in Ireland.\n\n2:40:30.360 --> 2:40:32.320\n And he said, he's just a little older than me.\n\n2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:33.160\n He's in his fifties.\n\n2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:35.960\n He said, man, I should have done it.\n\n2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:37.000\n I should have went to America.\n\n2:40:37.000 --> 2:40:38.240\n My dad said, go to America.\n\n2:40:38.240 --> 2:40:41.480\n I went to England and he went back to Ireland.\n\n2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:43.200\n And you know, but he's happy in Ireland.\n\n2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:44.040\n It's his home.\n\n2:40:44.040 --> 2:40:47.120\n But he said, wow, what a place of opportunity.\n\n2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:48.640\n And I said, it's never too late.\n\n2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:49.640\n He goes, yeah, but you know what?\n\n2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:50.800\n You get tied down.\n\n2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:52.400\n And I understand that.\n\n2:40:52.400 --> 2:40:55.360\n I thank God my mom came here at 16.\n\n2:40:55.360 --> 2:40:57.480\n I thank God my grandpa got on that ship.\n\n2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:00.560\n But in his 20s, 27, I think, you know,\n\n2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:02.960\n with not a nickel to rub together.\n\n2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:04.160\n I thank God they did it.\n\n2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:06.720\n Cause I don't know where else I would have ended up.\n\n2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:09.160\n There's no place else I want to be.\n\n2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:12.200\n And I thank God that there's people like you\n\n2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:16.200\n who rushed towards ground zero to help other human beings.\n\n2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:19.440\n And I believe that that human spirit\n\n2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:21.680\n is ultimately represents the best of this country\n\n2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:23.360\n and the best of this world.\n\n2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:25.480\n Thank you for the stories you're telling,\n\n2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:27.760\n for your perseverance in that.\n\n2:41:27.760 --> 2:41:31.000\n And thank you for welcoming me to the crew.\n\n2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:31.840\n You're very welcome.\n\n2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:32.680\n I'm proud.\n\n2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:33.960\n And we'll take you any day.\n\n2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:35.720\n You look like you could do the job just fine.\n\n2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:38.840\n I love lifting heavy things and doing dangerous things.\n\n2:41:38.840 --> 2:41:42.160\n So I'm proud to be part of this country\n\n2:41:42.160 --> 2:41:43.920\n and part of the Tally Ho now.\n\n2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:46.600\n Well, you are definitely an attribute to America\n\n2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:48.800\n and we're glad you chose to come here.\n\n2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:51.440\n You know, Lex, it's such a beautiful place.\n\n2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:52.720\n It's a beautiful melting pot.\n\n2:41:52.720 --> 2:41:54.080\n You know, if we were all the same,\n\n2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:55.720\n it would be kind of a boring place, right?\n\n2:41:55.720 --> 2:41:56.680\n Kind of boring.\n\n2:41:56.680 --> 2:41:57.560\n It really would.\n\n2:41:57.560 --> 2:41:59.560\n But it's just such a great place.\n\n2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:00.680\n And I just want to say thanks.\n\n2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:02.040\n It's an honor.\n\n2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:04.880\n It's an honor to have someone to let me sound off\n\n2:42:04.880 --> 2:42:06.760\n and it'll be even bigger honor\n\n2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:08.480\n if somebody will listen to me and just say,\n\n2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:11.520\n hey, you know, let me just try to do something good today.\n\n2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:13.840\n And you know, that's the tunnel to towers mantra\n\n2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:15.640\n is let us do good.\n\n2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:17.240\n And I just, you know,\n\n2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:22.840\n I got a really big credit card with God,\n\n2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:24.040\n a big balance, right?\n\n2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:26.360\n I need to pay him back a lot\n\n2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:27.720\n and I need to pay him forward.\n\n2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:30.480\n And I'm just going to spend the rest of my days\n\n2:42:30.480 --> 2:42:31.400\n trying my best.\n\n2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:33.200\n I don't know where this is going to go,\n\n2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:34.280\n what it'll lead into,\n\n2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:37.080\n but I really would like to get those dogs\n\n2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:39.200\n or those vets and build them that village\n\n2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:41.800\n and just keep going on from project to project\n\n2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:45.560\n to just say, when my final day comes\n\n2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:48.320\n and I'm laying there and I say, you know what?\n\n2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:50.400\n I really made the most of that second chance\n\n2:42:50.400 --> 2:42:52.680\n God gave me way back in 2011.\n\n2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:55.000\n I mean, I hope it's 30, 40 years from now,\n\n2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:57.400\n but even if it's 30 months from now,\n\n2:42:57.400 --> 2:42:59.760\n I'm giving it the best shot.\n\n2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:00.600\n So thank you, sir.\n\n2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:02.920\n I appreciate it and wishing you blessings\n\n2:43:02.920 --> 2:43:04.320\n and success in your career.\n\n2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:05.400\n Keep up the good fight\n\n2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:08.040\n and you're always welcome back to Texas.\n\n2:43:08.040 --> 2:43:08.880\n Oh, I love it.\n\n2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:11.720\n It's great food and a little hot,\n\n2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:14.240\n a little hot, but I can deal with it.\n\n2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:17.200\n We don't do so good Irish in the sun, you know?\n\n2:43:17.200 --> 2:43:19.040\n Well, the barbecue and the people are worth it.\n\n2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:20.240\n No, they are, they're awesome.\n\n2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:23.680\n I was down here for some storm relief a few years ago\n\n2:43:23.680 --> 2:43:25.320\n and I tell you what, I fell in love with it.\n\n2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:26.880\n The people are great, it's a great state\n\n2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:30.960\n and yeah, I'll definitely be back again for sure.\n\n2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:31.960\n Thanks for talking to me, Neil.\n\n2:43:31.960 --> 2:43:32.800\n Thank you, sir.\n\n2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:34.240\n Appreciate it.\n\n2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:35.840\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:37.320\n with Niels Jorgensen.\n\n2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:38.520\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:43:38.520 --> 2:43:41.760\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:43.360\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:45.800\n from Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:48.920\n Human kindness has never weakened the stamina\n\n2:43:48.920 --> 2:43:51.840\n or softened the fiber of a free people.\n\n2:43:51.840 --> 2:43:55.480\n A nation does not have to be cruel, to be tough.\n\n2:43:55.480 --> 2:44:18.480\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
