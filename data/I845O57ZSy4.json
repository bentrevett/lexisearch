00:06.960\n and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.\n\n00:06.960 --> 00:07.920\n It was all still keyboard.\n\n00:07.920 --> 00:10.960\n We didn't even have mice set up at that time,\n\n00:10.960 --> 00:14.740\n but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.\n\n00:14.740 --> 00:16.800\n The wall disappears in a little animation\n\n00:16.800 --> 00:18.760\n and there's a monster like right there.\n\n00:18.760 --> 00:20.440\n And he practically fell out of his chair.\n\n00:20.440 --> 00:24.680\n It was just like, ah, and games just didn't do that.\n\n00:24.680 --> 00:26.800\n You know, the games were the God's eye view.\n\n00:26.800 --> 00:28.760\n You were a little invested in your little guy.\n\n00:28.760 --> 00:32.200\n You can be like, you know, happy or sad when things happen,\n\n00:32.200 --> 00:34.880\n but you just did not get that kind of startled reaction.\n\n00:34.880 --> 00:36.360\n You weren't inside the game.\n\n00:36.360 --> 00:38.000\n Something in the back of your brain,\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.200\n some reptile brain thing is just going,\n\n00:40.200 --> 00:42.400\n oh shit, something just happened.\n\n00:42.400 --> 00:44.960\n And that was one of those early points where it's like,\n\n00:44.960 --> 00:47.240\n yeah, this is going to make a difference.\n\n00:47.240 --> 00:50.020\n This is going to be powerful and it's going to matter.\n\n00:52.300 --> 00:55.140\n The following is a conversation with John Carmack,\n\n00:55.140 --> 00:58.520\n widely considered to be one of the greatest programmers\n\n00:58.520 --> 00:59.520\n ever.\n\n00:59.520 --> 01:01.960\n He was the cofounder of id Software\n\n01:01.960 --> 01:03.880\n and the lead programmer on several games\n\n01:03.880 --> 01:07.360\n that revolutionized the technology, the experience,\n\n01:07.360 --> 01:09.800\n and the role of gaming in our society,\n\n01:09.800 --> 01:14.800\n including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake.\n\n01:15.800 --> 01:19.960\n He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR,\n\n01:19.960 --> 01:23.080\n helping to create portals into virtual worlds\n\n01:23.080 --> 01:25.480\n and to define the technological path\n\n01:25.480 --> 01:28.120\n to the metaverse and meta.\n\n01:28.120 --> 01:30.960\n And now he has been shifting some of his attention\n\n01:30.960 --> 01:34.840\n to the problem of artificial general intelligence.\n\n01:34.840 --> 01:38.400\n This was the longest conversation on this podcast\n\n01:38.400 --> 01:40.080\n at over five hours.\n\n01:40.080 --> 01:43.720\n And still, I could talk to John many, many more times,\n\n01:43.720 --> 01:45.580\n and we hope to do just that.\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:48.680\n This is the Lux Readman podcast.\n\n01:48.680 --> 01:50.840\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:50.840 --> 01:52.160\n in the description.\n\n01:52.160 --> 01:56.360\n And now, dear friends, here's John Carmack.\n\n01:56.360 --> 02:00.040\n What was the first program you've ever written?\n\n02:00.040 --> 02:01.200\n Do you remember?\n\n02:01.200 --> 02:02.040\n Yeah, I do.\n\n02:02.040 --> 02:04.400\n So I remember being in a radio shack\n\n02:04.400 --> 02:06.800\n going up to the TRS 80 computers\n\n02:06.800 --> 02:09.840\n and learning just enough to be able to do\n\n02:09.840 --> 02:12.760\n 10 print John Carmack.\n\n02:12.760 --> 02:15.960\n And it's kind of interesting how, of course,\n\n02:15.960 --> 02:19.040\n Carnegie and Ritchie kind of standardized Hello World\n\n02:19.040 --> 02:20.040\n as the first thing that you do\n\n02:20.040 --> 02:22.720\n in every computer programming language in every computer,\n\n02:22.720 --> 02:24.800\n but not having any interaction\n\n02:24.800 --> 02:28.200\n with the cultures of Unix or any other standardized things.\n\n02:28.200 --> 02:29.840\n It was just like, well, what am I gonna say?\n\n02:29.840 --> 02:30.960\n I'm gonna say my name.\n\n02:30.960 --> 02:33.160\n And then you learn how to do go to 10\n\n02:33.160 --> 02:34.920\n and have it scroll all off the screen.\n\n02:34.920 --> 02:37.280\n And that was definitely the first thing\n\n02:37.280 --> 02:39.520\n that I wound up doing on a computer.\n\n02:39.520 --> 02:41.280\n Can I ask you a programming advice?\n\n02:41.280 --> 02:42.680\n I was always told in the beginning\n\n02:42.680 --> 02:44.360\n that you're not allowed to use go to statements.\n\n02:44.360 --> 02:45.520\n That's really bad programming.\n\n02:45.520 --> 02:46.920\n Is this correct or not?\n\n02:46.920 --> 02:50.280\n Jumping around code, can we look at the philosophy\n\n02:50.280 --> 02:53.680\n and the technical aspects of the go to statement\n\n02:53.680 --> 02:55.120\n that seems so convenient,\n\n02:55.120 --> 02:55.960\n but it's supposed to be bad programming?\n\n02:55.960 --> 02:57.280\n Well, so certainly back in the day\n\n02:57.280 --> 02:58.920\n in basic programming languages,\n\n02:58.920 --> 03:00.760\n you didn't have proper loops.\n\n03:00.760 --> 03:02.720\n You didn't have four whiles and repeats.\n\n03:02.720 --> 03:04.840\n That was the land of Pascal for people\n\n03:04.840 --> 03:07.360\n that kind of generally had access to it back then.\n\n03:07.360 --> 03:10.360\n So you had no choice but to use go tos.\n\n03:10.360 --> 03:13.440\n And as you made what were big programs back then,\n\n03:13.440 --> 03:15.560\n which were a thousand line basic program\n\n03:15.560 --> 03:16.720\n is a really big program.\n\n03:16.720 --> 03:19.960\n They did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:23.360\n You didn't have good editors or code exploration tools.\n\n03:23.360 --> 03:26.160\n So you would wind up fixing things in one place,\n\n03:26.160 --> 03:27.120\n add a little patch.\n\n03:27.120 --> 03:29.680\n And there's reasons why structured programming\n\n03:29.680 --> 03:31.720\n generally helps understanding,\n\n03:31.720 --> 03:33.800\n but go tos aren't poisonous.\n\n03:33.800 --> 03:35.920\n Sometimes they're the right thing to do.\n\n03:35.920 --> 03:38.840\n Usually it's because there's a language feature missing\n\n03:38.840 --> 03:40.520\n like nested breaks or something\n\n03:40.520 --> 03:44.560\n where it can sometimes be better to do a go to cleanup\n\n03:44.560 --> 03:48.040\n or go to error rather than having multiple flags,\n\n03:48.040 --> 03:50.440\n multiple if statements littered throughout things.\n\n03:50.440 --> 03:51.800\n But it is rare.\n\n03:51.800 --> 03:55.120\n I mean, if you gripped through all of my code right now,\n\n03:55.120 --> 03:57.520\n I don't think any of my current code bases\n\n03:57.520 --> 03:58.960\n would actually have a go to,\n\n03:58.960 --> 04:02.640\n but deep within sort of the technical underpinnings\n\n04:02.640 --> 04:03.720\n of a major game engine,\n\n04:03.720 --> 04:07.200\n you're gonna have some go tos in a couple of places probably.\n\n04:07.200 --> 04:09.160\n Yeah, the infrastructure on top of,\n\n04:09.160 --> 04:11.240\n like the closer you get to machine code,\n\n04:11.240 --> 04:12.680\n the more go tos you're gonna see,\n\n04:12.680 --> 04:15.640\n the more of these like hacks you're going to see\n\n04:15.640 --> 04:18.240\n because the set of features available to you\n\n04:18.240 --> 04:22.360\n in low level programming languages is not, is limited.\n\n04:22.360 --> 04:25.920\n So print John Carmack,\n\n04:25.920 --> 04:28.360\n when is the first time,\n\n04:28.360 --> 04:30.000\n if we could talk about love,\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:31.680\n that you fell in love with programming?\n\n04:31.680 --> 04:34.640\n You said like, this is really something special.\n\n04:34.640 --> 04:36.040\n It really was something\n\n04:36.040 --> 04:38.120\n that was one of those love at first sight things\n\n04:38.120 --> 04:39.920\n where just really from the time\n\n04:39.920 --> 04:42.720\n that I understood what a computer was even,\n\n04:42.720 --> 04:45.440\n I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias\n\n04:45.440 --> 04:48.560\n of the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes\n\n04:48.560 --> 04:50.240\n at the reel to reel tape decks.\n\n04:50.240 --> 04:52.320\n And for people nowadays,\n\n04:52.320 --> 04:53.800\n it can be a little hard to understand\n\n04:53.800 --> 04:56.280\n what the world was like then from information gathering\n\n04:56.280 --> 04:58.720\n where I would go to the libraries\n\n04:58.720 --> 05:01.080\n and there would be a couple books on the shelf\n\n05:01.080 --> 05:03.880\n about computers and they would be very out of date\n\n05:03.880 --> 05:06.640\n even at that point, just not a lot of information,\n\n05:06.640 --> 05:09.160\n but I would grab everything that I could find\n\n05:09.160 --> 05:10.560\n and devour everything.\n\n05:10.560 --> 05:14.200\n Whenever Time or Newsweek had some article about computers,\n\n05:14.200 --> 05:16.960\n I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.\n\n05:16.960 --> 05:19.960\n It just, it felt like this magical thing to me,\n\n05:19.960 --> 05:23.480\n this idea that the computer would just do exactly\n\n05:23.480 --> 05:24.480\n what you told it to.\n\n05:24.480 --> 05:26.640\n I mean, and there's a little bit of the genie monkey's paw\n\n05:26.640 --> 05:28.960\n sort of issues there where you'd better be really,\n\n05:28.960 --> 05:31.080\n really careful with what you're telling it to do,\n\n05:31.080 --> 05:33.120\n but it wasn't gonna back talk you.\n\n05:33.120 --> 05:34.720\n It wasn't gonna have a different point of view.\n\n05:34.720 --> 05:37.400\n It was gonna carry out what you told it to do.\n\n05:37.400 --> 05:39.840\n And if you had the right commands,\n\n05:39.840 --> 05:43.560\n you could make it do these pretty magical things.\n\n05:43.560 --> 05:46.000\n And so what kind of programs did you write at first?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.280\n So beyond the print, John Carmack.\n\n05:48.280 --> 05:51.800\n So I can remember as going through the learning process\n\n05:51.800 --> 05:53.720\n where you find at the start,\n\n05:53.720 --> 05:54.600\n you're just learning how to do\n\n05:54.600 --> 05:56.400\n the most basic possible things.\n\n05:56.400 --> 05:59.840\n And I can remember stuff like a Superman comic\n\n05:59.840 --> 06:02.640\n that RadioShack commissioned to have,\n\n06:02.640 --> 06:04.840\n it's like Superman had lost some of his super brain\n\n06:04.840 --> 06:07.520\n and kids had to use RadioShack TRS 80 computers\n\n06:07.520 --> 06:09.920\n to do calculations for it to help him\n\n06:09.920 --> 06:11.960\n kind of complete his heroics.\n\n06:11.960 --> 06:15.240\n And I'd find little things like that\n\n06:15.240 --> 06:17.320\n and then get a few basic books\n\n06:17.320 --> 06:20.120\n to be able to kind of work my way up.\n\n06:20.120 --> 06:22.440\n And again, it was so precious back then.\n\n06:22.440 --> 06:23.640\n I had a couple of books\n\n06:23.640 --> 06:25.920\n that would teach me important things about it.\n\n06:25.920 --> 06:28.640\n I had one book that I could start to learn\n\n06:28.640 --> 06:30.320\n a little bit of assembly language from,\n\n06:30.320 --> 06:32.000\n and I'd have a few books on basic\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.560\n and some things that I could get from the libraries.\n\n06:34.560 --> 06:37.160\n But my goals in the early days\n\n06:37.160 --> 06:40.000\n was almost always making games of various kinds.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:44.880\n I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games.\n\n06:44.880 --> 06:47.720\n And being able to do some of those things myself\n\n06:47.720 --> 06:51.360\n on the computers was very much what I aspired to.\n\n06:51.360 --> 06:53.000\n And it was a whole journey where\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:54.360\n if you learn normal basic,\n\n06:54.360 --> 06:56.080\n you can't do any kind of an action game.\n\n06:56.080 --> 06:57.400\n You can write an adventure game.\n\n06:57.400 --> 07:00.360\n You can write things where you say, what do you do here?\n\n07:00.360 --> 07:03.600\n I get sword attack troll, that type of thing.\n\n07:03.600 --> 07:07.040\n And that can be done in the context of basic.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:09.520\n But to do things that had moving graphics,\n\n07:09.520 --> 07:11.280\n there were only the most limited things\n\n07:11.280 --> 07:12.240\n you could possibly do.\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:14.040\n You could maybe do breakout or pong\n\n07:14.040 --> 07:16.920\n or that sort of thing in low resolution graphics.\n\n07:16.920 --> 07:20.720\n And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks\n\n07:20.720 --> 07:25.400\n that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers,\n\n07:25.400 --> 07:28.800\n they had a mode called low resolution graphics\n\n07:28.800 --> 07:31.400\n where of course all graphics were low resolution back then,\n\n07:31.400 --> 07:34.080\n but regular low resolution graphics,\n\n07:34.080 --> 07:37.160\n it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally,\n\n07:37.160 --> 07:39.480\n but they could have 16 different colors.\n\n07:39.480 --> 07:42.080\n And I wanted to make a game kind of like\n\n07:42.080 --> 07:44.920\n the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game.\n\n07:44.920 --> 07:47.400\n And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up.\n\n07:47.400 --> 07:49.240\n And I could move a little ship around.\n\n07:49.240 --> 07:50.760\n You could manage to do that in basic,\n\n07:50.760 --> 07:53.520\n but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen.\n\n07:53.520 --> 07:56.000\n And I remember at the time just coming up\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.160\n with what felt like a brainstorm to me\n\n07:58.160 --> 08:02.000\n where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.120\n where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen\n\n08:05.120 --> 08:06.880\n were basically the same thing.\n\n08:06.880 --> 08:09.640\n And all those computers could scroll their text screen\n\n08:09.640 --> 08:10.240\n reasonably.\n\n08:10.240 --> 08:12.680\n You could do a listing and it would scroll things up.\n\n08:12.680 --> 08:16.480\n And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple\n\n08:16.480 --> 08:19.640\n things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode\n\n08:19.640 --> 08:21.600\n and I could draw graphics and then I could just\n\n08:21.600 --> 08:24.360\n do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen.\n\n08:24.360 --> 08:26.320\n And then the system would scroll it all up\n\n08:26.320 --> 08:28.080\n using an assembly language routine\n\n08:28.080 --> 08:30.200\n that I didn't know how to write back then.\n\n08:30.200 --> 08:33.360\n So that was like this first great hack\n\n08:33.360 --> 08:36.040\n that sort of had analogs later on in my career\n\n08:36.040 --> 08:37.240\n for a lot of different things.\n\n08:37.240 --> 08:39.400\n So I found out that I could draw a screen.\n\n08:39.400 --> 08:40.920\n I could do a line feed at the bottom.\n\n08:40.920 --> 08:42.160\n It would scroll it up once.\n\n08:42.160 --> 08:44.720\n I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom.\n\n08:44.720 --> 08:47.240\n And that was my first way to kind of scroll\n\n08:47.240 --> 08:50.680\n the screen, which was interesting in that that played\n\n08:50.680 --> 08:53.280\n a big part later on in the id Software days as well.\n\n08:53.280 --> 08:57.480\n So do efficient drawing where you\n\n08:57.480 --> 08:59.200\n don't have to draw the whole screen,\n\n08:59.200 --> 09:01.120\n but you draw from the bottom using\n\n09:01.120 --> 09:04.520\n the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output.\n\n09:04.520 --> 09:05.160\n Yeah.\n\n09:05.160 --> 09:08.960\n Where so much of, until recently,\n\n09:08.960 --> 09:12.120\n game design was limited by what you could actually\n\n09:12.120 --> 09:13.200\n get the computer to do.\n\n09:13.200 --> 09:16.000\n Where it's easy to say, OK, I want to scroll the screen.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.400\n You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset.\n\n09:19.400 --> 09:21.560\n And nowadays, that works just fine.\n\n09:21.560 --> 09:24.680\n Computers are ludicrously fast.\n\n09:24.680 --> 09:28.040\n But up until a decade ago or so, there\n\n09:28.040 --> 09:30.120\n were all these things everybody wanted to do.\n\n09:30.120 --> 09:31.880\n But if they knew enough programming\n\n09:31.880 --> 09:34.960\n to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow\n\n09:34.960 --> 09:36.440\n to be a good experience.\n\n09:36.440 --> 09:39.320\n Either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough\n\n09:39.320 --> 09:42.040\n that it wasn't fun to experience it like that.\n\n09:42.040 --> 09:45.600\n So much of the first couple of decades of the programming work\n\n09:45.600 --> 09:47.760\n that I did was largely figuring out\n\n09:47.760 --> 09:49.200\n how to do something that everybody\n\n09:49.200 --> 09:51.520\n knows how they want it to happen.\n\n09:51.520 --> 09:54.240\n It just has to happen 2 to 10 times faster\n\n09:54.240 --> 09:57.360\n than the straightforward way of doing things\n\n09:57.360 --> 09:58.680\n would make it happen.\n\n09:58.680 --> 10:02.560\n And it's different now because at this point, lots of things\n\n10:02.560 --> 10:05.000\n you can just do in the most naive possible way,\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:06.520\n and it still works out.\n\n10:06.520 --> 10:09.520\n You don't have nearly the creative limitations\n\n10:09.520 --> 10:12.680\n or the incentives for optimizing on that level.\n\n10:12.680 --> 10:14.520\n And there's a lot of pros and cons to that.\n\n10:14.520 --> 10:16.520\n But I do generally, I'm not going\n\n10:16.520 --> 10:20.000\n to do the angry old man shaking my fist at the clouds bit\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.560\n where back in my day, programmers\n\n10:21.560 --> 10:23.200\n had to do real programming.\n\n10:23.200 --> 10:26.640\n It's amazing that you can just pick an idea\n\n10:26.640 --> 10:27.840\n and go do it right now.\n\n10:27.840 --> 10:30.520\n And you don't have to be some assembly language wizard\n\n10:30.520 --> 10:33.840\n or deep GPU arcanist to be able to figure out\n\n10:33.840 --> 10:35.160\n how to make your wishes happen.\n\n10:35.160 --> 10:38.400\n Well, there's still, see, that's true.\n\n10:38.400 --> 10:41.320\n But let me put on my old man with a fist hat\n\n10:41.320 --> 10:45.200\n and say that probably the thing that will define the future\n\n10:45.200 --> 10:48.720\n still requires you to operate at the limits\n\n10:48.720 --> 10:49.720\n of the current system.\n\n10:49.720 --> 10:51.880\n So we'll probably talk about this.\n\n10:51.880 --> 10:54.440\n But if you talk about building the metaverse\n\n10:54.440 --> 10:57.120\n and building a VR experience that's compelling,\n\n10:57.120 --> 11:01.280\n it probably requires you to not, to go to assembly\n\n11:01.280 --> 11:05.840\n or maybe not literally, but sort of spiritually\n\n11:05.840 --> 11:08.360\n to go to the limits of what the system is capable of.\n\n11:08.360 --> 11:10.840\n And that really was why virtual reality\n\n11:10.840 --> 11:13.640\n was specifically interesting to me\n\n11:13.640 --> 11:15.000\n where it had all the ties to,\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.080\n you could say that even back in the early days,\n\n11:17.080 --> 11:19.160\n I have some old magazine articles\n\n11:19.160 --> 11:22.160\n that's talking about Doom as a virtual reality experience\n\n11:22.160 --> 11:25.200\n back when just seeing anything in 3D.\n\n11:25.200 --> 11:27.320\n So you could say that we've been trying to build\n\n11:27.320 --> 11:29.640\n those virtual experiences from the very beginning.\n\n11:29.640 --> 11:32.840\n And in the modern era of virtual reality,\n\n11:32.840 --> 11:34.800\n especially on the mobile side of things,\n\n11:34.800 --> 11:36.680\n when it's standalone and you're basically using\n\n11:36.680 --> 11:39.000\n a cell phone chip to be able to produce\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.800\n these very immersive experiences,\n\n11:41.800 --> 11:43.640\n it does require work.\n\n11:43.640 --> 11:45.720\n It's not at the level of what an old school\n\n11:45.720 --> 11:48.480\n console game programmer would have operated at\n\n11:48.480 --> 11:50.320\n where you're looking at hardware registers\n\n11:50.320 --> 11:53.520\n and you're scheduling all the DMA accesses,\n\n11:53.520 --> 11:55.520\n but it is still definitely a different level\n\n11:55.520 --> 12:00.160\n than what a web developer or even a PC Steam game developer\n\n12:00.160 --> 12:01.760\n usually has to work at.\n\n12:01.760 --> 12:02.840\n And again, it's great.\n\n12:02.840 --> 12:04.920\n There's opportunities for people that wanna operate\n\n12:04.920 --> 12:06.400\n at either end of that spectrum there\n\n12:06.400 --> 12:08.640\n and still provide a lot of value to the world.\n\n12:09.560 --> 12:14.560\n Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.\n\n12:15.560 --> 12:19.920\n What would you say is the best programming language?\n\n12:19.920 --> 12:22.560\n Your favorite, but also the best.\n\n12:22.560 --> 12:25.160\n You've seen throughout your career,\n\n12:25.160 --> 12:26.960\n you're considered by many to be\n\n12:26.960 --> 12:29.440\n the greatest programmer ever.\n\n12:29.440 --> 12:32.320\n I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone,\n\n12:32.320 --> 12:34.000\n but if you put it on anyone, it's you.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.380\n So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions\n\n12:36.380 --> 12:38.760\n of what's the best band of all time,\n\n12:38.760 --> 12:41.520\n but in your case, what's the best programming language?\n\n12:41.520 --> 12:43.520\n Everything has all the caveats about it.\n\n12:43.520 --> 12:47.480\n But so what I use, so nowadays I do program\n\n12:47.480 --> 12:52.480\n a reasonable amount of Python for AI, ML sorts of work.\n\n12:52.800 --> 12:54.440\n I'm not a native Python programmer.\n\n12:54.440 --> 12:57.000\n It's something I came to very late in my career.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.800\n I understand what it's good for.\n\n12:58.800 --> 13:00.080\n But you don't dream in Python.\n\n13:00.080 --> 13:00.920\n I do not.\n\n13:00.920 --> 13:02.380\n And it has some of those things\n\n13:02.380 --> 13:04.800\n where there's some amazing stats when you say,\n\n13:04.800 --> 13:07.160\n if you just start, if you make a loop,\n\n13:07.160 --> 13:10.980\n a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python,\n\n13:10.980 --> 13:14.840\n you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower\n\n13:14.840 --> 13:17.600\n than a proper GPU tensor operation.\n\n13:17.600 --> 13:19.800\n And these are staggering numbers.\n\n13:19.800 --> 13:22.800\n You can be as much slower as we've almost gotten faster\n\n13:22.800 --> 13:26.920\n in our pace of progress and all this other miraculous stuff.\n\n13:26.920 --> 13:28.840\n So your intuitions about inefficiencies\n\n13:28.840 --> 13:30.200\n within the Python sort of...\n\n13:30.200 --> 13:32.080\n It keeps hitting me upside the face\n\n13:32.080 --> 13:34.160\n where it's gotten to the point now I understand.\n\n13:34.160 --> 13:35.840\n It's like, okay, you just can't do a loop\n\n13:35.840 --> 13:38.480\n if you care about performance in Python.\n\n13:38.480 --> 13:41.380\n You have to figure out how you can reformat this\n\n13:41.380 --> 13:43.100\n into some big vector operation\n\n13:43.100 --> 13:44.920\n or something that's going to be done completely\n\n13:44.920 --> 13:47.080\n within a C++ library.\n\n13:47.080 --> 13:49.920\n But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient\n\n13:49.920 --> 13:52.320\n and you just see stuff that people are able\n\n13:52.320 --> 13:54.560\n to cobble together by you just import\n\n13:54.560 --> 13:56.460\n a few different things and you can do stuff\n\n13:56.460 --> 13:58.880\n that nobody on earth could do 10 years ago.\n\n13:58.880 --> 14:00.520\n And you can do it in a little cookbook thing\n\n14:00.520 --> 14:02.840\n that you copy paste it out of a website.\n\n14:02.840 --> 14:04.820\n So that is really great.\n\n14:04.820 --> 14:06.960\n When I'm sitting down to do what I consider\n\n14:06.960 --> 14:10.440\n kind of serious programming, it's still in C++.\n\n14:10.440 --> 14:13.960\n And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that\n\n14:13.960 --> 14:17.160\n where I'm not big into the modern template\n\n14:17.160 --> 14:18.780\n metaprogramming sorts of things.\n\n14:18.780 --> 14:21.280\n I see a lot of train wrecks coming from\n\n14:21.280 --> 14:23.500\n some of that over abstraction.\n\n14:23.500 --> 14:26.800\n I spent a few years really going kind of deep\n\n14:26.800 --> 14:30.120\n into the kind of the historical Lisp work\n\n14:30.120 --> 14:32.320\n and Haskell and some of the functional programming\n\n14:32.320 --> 14:33.360\n sides of things.\n\n14:33.360 --> 14:37.040\n And there is a lot of value there\n\n14:37.040 --> 14:38.700\n in the way you think about things.\n\n14:38.700 --> 14:42.160\n And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code\n\n14:42.160 --> 14:44.960\n based on what I learned about the value\n\n14:44.960 --> 14:48.080\n that comes out of not having this random mutable state\n\n14:48.080 --> 14:50.240\n that you kind of lose track of.\n\n14:50.240 --> 14:53.640\n Because something that many people don't really appreciate\n\n14:53.640 --> 14:55.500\n till they've been at it for a long time\n\n14:55.500 --> 14:58.240\n is that it's not the writing of the program initially,\n\n14:58.240 --> 15:00.440\n it's the whole lifespan of the program.\n\n15:00.440 --> 15:02.680\n And that's when it's not necessarily just\n\n15:02.680 --> 15:05.500\n how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates,\n\n15:05.500 --> 15:07.720\n but it's how can it bend and adapt\n\n15:07.720 --> 15:09.240\n as situations change.\n\n15:09.240 --> 15:11.160\n And then the thing that I've really been learning\n\n15:11.160 --> 15:14.720\n in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work\n\n15:14.720 --> 15:16.960\n is it's also how well it hands off\n\n15:16.960 --> 15:19.960\n between the continuous kind of revolving door of programmers\n\n15:19.960 --> 15:21.960\n taking over maintenance and different things\n\n15:21.960 --> 15:24.600\n and how you get people up to speed in different areas.\n\n15:24.600 --> 15:27.140\n And there's all these other different aspects of it.\n\n15:27.140 --> 15:32.140\n So C++ is a good language for handover between engineers.\n\n15:32.520 --> 15:34.800\n Probably not the best.\n\n15:34.800 --> 15:36.900\n And there's some really interesting aspects to this\n\n15:36.900 --> 15:39.360\n where in some cases languages\n\n15:39.360 --> 15:43.460\n that are not generally thought well of for many reasons,\n\n15:43.460 --> 15:46.400\n like C is derided pretty broadly that yes,\n\n15:46.400 --> 15:48.160\n obviously all of these security flaws\n\n15:48.160 --> 15:50.400\n that happen with the memory and unsafeness\n\n15:50.400 --> 15:53.920\n and buffer overruns and the things that you've got there,\n\n15:53.920 --> 15:56.680\n but there is this underappreciated aspect\n\n15:56.680 --> 15:59.560\n to the language is so simple, anyone can go.\n\n15:59.560 --> 16:03.080\n And if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace\n\n16:03.080 --> 16:06.140\n and not have to learn what paradigms they're using\n\n16:06.140 --> 16:08.320\n because there just aren't that many available.\n\n16:08.320 --> 16:12.480\n I think there's some really, really well written C code.\n\n16:12.480 --> 16:15.520\n Like I find it great that if I'm messing around\n\n16:15.520 --> 16:17.120\n with something in open BSD say,\n\n16:17.120 --> 16:19.320\n I mean, I can be walking around in the kernel\n\n16:19.320 --> 16:22.160\n and I'm like, I understand everything that's going on here.\n\n16:22.160 --> 16:25.960\n It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do\n\n16:25.960 --> 16:29.760\n to make whatever change that I need to\n\n16:29.760 --> 16:32.820\n while you can have more significant languages.\n\n16:32.820 --> 16:34.800\n Like it's a downside of Lisp\n\n16:34.800 --> 16:37.320\n where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp.\n\n16:37.320 --> 16:40.880\n I think that it did help my thinking\n\n16:40.880 --> 16:42.780\n about programming in some ways,\n\n16:42.780 --> 16:45.400\n but the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp\n\n16:45.400 --> 16:47.840\n are saying how malleable of a language it is\n\n16:47.840 --> 16:50.080\n that if you write a huge Lisp program,\n\n16:50.080 --> 16:53.120\n you've basically invented your own kind of language\n\n16:53.120 --> 16:55.440\n and structure because it's not the primitives\n\n16:55.440 --> 16:57.000\n of the language you're using very much.\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.480\n It's all of the things you've built on top of that.\n\n16:59.480 --> 17:01.040\n And then a language like Racket,\n\n17:01.040 --> 17:03.360\n kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions,\n\n17:03.360 --> 17:05.320\n it's essentially touted as a language\n\n17:05.320 --> 17:07.020\n for building other languages.\n\n17:07.020 --> 17:10.080\n And I understand the value of that\n\n17:10.080 --> 17:12.440\n for a tiny little project,\n\n17:12.440 --> 17:14.800\n but the idea of that for one of these longterm\n\n17:14.800 --> 17:18.000\n supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.480\n where all of those abstractions that you're like,\n\n17:20.480 --> 17:23.920\n okay, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself\n\n17:23.920 --> 17:26.760\n on all of these things that we've built on top of that.\n\n17:26.760 --> 17:30.420\n And it was interesting to see how when Google made Go,\n\n17:30.420 --> 17:33.160\n a lot of the criticisms of that are it's like,\n\n17:33.160 --> 17:35.040\n wow, this is not a state of the art language.\n\n17:35.040 --> 17:38.080\n This language is just so simple and almost crude.\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:40.480\n And you could see the programming language people\n\n17:40.480 --> 17:41.920\n just looking down at it.\n\n17:41.920 --> 17:45.360\n But it does seem to be quite popular as basically saying,\n\n17:45.360 --> 17:47.240\n this is the good things about C,\n\n17:47.240 --> 17:49.360\n everybody can just jump right in and use it.\n\n17:49.360 --> 17:52.060\n You don't need to restructure your brain\n\n17:52.060 --> 17:53.880\n to write good code in it.\n\n17:53.880 --> 17:56.300\n So I wish that I had more opportunity\n\n17:56.300 --> 17:59.000\n for doing some work in Go.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.160\n Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about\n\n18:02.160 --> 18:04.200\n that I'm not fit to pass judgment on.\n\n18:04.200 --> 18:06.620\n I've done a little bit beyond Hello World.\n\n18:06.620 --> 18:09.940\n I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust\n\n18:09.940 --> 18:12.720\n just as an exercise, but that was a few years ago\n\n18:12.720 --> 18:15.040\n and I haven't really used it since.\n\n18:15.040 --> 18:17.640\n The best programming language is the one that works generally\n\n18:17.640 --> 18:19.160\n that you're currently using.\n\n18:19.160 --> 18:22.280\n Because that's another trap is in almost every case\n\n18:22.280 --> 18:25.000\n I've seen when people mixed languages on a project,\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.060\n that's a mistake.\n\n18:26.060 --> 18:29.000\n I would rather stay just in one language\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.680\n so that everybody can work across the entire thing.\n\n18:31.680 --> 18:34.380\n And we have, I get meta, we have a lot of projects\n\n18:34.380 --> 18:36.400\n that use kind of React frameworks.\n\n18:36.400 --> 18:37.900\n So you've got JavaScript here\n\n18:37.900 --> 18:40.960\n and then you have C++ for real work.\n\n18:40.960 --> 18:42.720\n And then you may have Java interfacing\n\n18:42.720 --> 18:44.680\n with some other part of the Android system.\n\n18:44.680 --> 18:47.000\n And those are all kind of horrible things.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:51.320\n And that was one thing that I remember talking\n\n18:51.320 --> 18:54.640\n with Boz at Facebook about it where like,\n\n18:54.640 --> 18:56.020\n man, I wish we could have just said,\n\n18:56.020 --> 18:59.000\n we're only hiring C++ programmers.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:02.700\n And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective,\n\n19:02.700 --> 19:05.400\n well, we just wouldn't be able to find enough.\n\n19:05.400 --> 19:08.040\n With the thousands of programmers they've got there,\n\n19:08.040 --> 19:10.780\n it is not necessarily a dying breed,\n\n19:10.780 --> 19:12.880\n but you can sure find a lot more Java\n\n19:12.880 --> 19:14.960\n or JavaScript programmers.\n\n19:14.960 --> 19:17.860\n And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time\n\n19:17.860 --> 19:21.120\n and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.\n\n19:21.120 --> 19:22.160\n It's like, well, you just,\n\n19:22.160 --> 19:23.960\n you go out and you find those programmers\n\n19:23.960 --> 19:25.520\n and you don't hire the other programmers\n\n19:25.520 --> 19:28.400\n that don't do the languages that you wanna use.\n\n19:28.400 --> 19:29.340\n But right now, I guess, yeah,\n\n19:29.340 --> 19:32.360\n they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work\n\n19:32.360 --> 19:33.760\n for the UI side of things.\n\n19:33.760 --> 19:35.420\n When you go find UI programmers,\n\n19:35.420 --> 19:36.920\n they're JavaScript programmers.\n\n19:36.920 --> 19:38.380\n I wonder if that's because there's a lot\n\n19:38.380 --> 19:39.720\n of JavaScript programmers.\n\n19:39.720 --> 19:44.720\n Because I do think that great programmers are rare.\n\n19:44.720 --> 19:48.360\n That it's not, you know, if you just look at statistics\n\n19:48.360 --> 19:51.220\n of how many people are using different programming languages,\n\n19:51.220 --> 19:53.280\n that doesn't tell you the story\n\n19:53.280 --> 19:55.760\n of what the great programmers are using.\n\n19:55.760 --> 19:59.160\n And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to,\n\n19:59.160 --> 20:00.820\n which is the fundamentals of a language.\n\n20:00.820 --> 20:01.720\n What does it encourage?\n\n20:01.720 --> 20:03.280\n How does it encourage you to think?\n\n20:03.280 --> 20:05.700\n What kind of systems does it encourage you to build?\n\n20:05.700 --> 20:07.800\n There is something about C++\n\n20:08.780 --> 20:11.240\n that has elements of creativity,\n\n20:11.240 --> 20:15.160\n but forces you to be an adult about your programming.\n\n20:15.160 --> 20:16.680\n It expects you to be an adult.\n\n20:16.680 --> 20:18.720\n It does not force you to.\n\n20:18.720 --> 20:23.720\n And so it brings out people that are willing to be creative\n\n20:23.720 --> 20:25.800\n in terms of building large systems\n\n20:25.800 --> 20:27.600\n and coming up with interesting solutions,\n\n20:27.600 --> 20:31.320\n but at the same time have the sort of the good\n\n20:31.320 --> 20:35.320\n software engineering practices that amend themselves\n\n20:35.320 --> 20:37.480\n to real world systems.\n\n20:37.480 --> 20:40.360\n Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.\n\n20:41.760 --> 20:46.280\n So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years,\n\n20:46.280 --> 20:49.560\n and humans are long gone, something tells me\n\n20:49.560 --> 20:53.560\n that most of the systems they find will be run by humans.\n\n20:53.560 --> 20:55.000\n Will be running JavaScript.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.600\n I kind of think that if we're living in a simulation,\n\n20:58.600 --> 21:00.000\n it's written in JavaScript.\n\n21:01.600 --> 21:04.520\n You know, for the longest time, even still,\n\n21:05.540 --> 21:08.120\n JavaScript didn't get any respect,\n\n21:08.120 --> 21:10.000\n and yet it runs so much of the world,\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:12.120\n and an increasing number of the world.\n\n21:12.120 --> 21:15.160\n Is it possible that everything will be written\n\n21:15.160 --> 21:16.720\n in JavaScript one day?\n\n21:16.720 --> 21:18.800\n So the engineering under JavaScript\n\n21:18.800 --> 21:21.300\n is really pretty phenomenal.\n\n21:21.300 --> 21:24.600\n The systems that make JavaScript run as fast\n\n21:24.600 --> 21:27.520\n as it does right now are kind of miracles\n\n21:27.520 --> 21:29.960\n of modern engineering in many ways.\n\n21:29.960 --> 21:34.440\n It does feel like it is not an optimal language\n\n21:34.440 --> 21:36.360\n for all the things that it's being used for,\n\n21:36.360 --> 21:40.040\n or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps\n\n21:40.040 --> 21:44.160\n in something like this without type systems and so on.\n\n21:45.760 --> 21:47.520\n But I think for a lot of people,\n\n21:47.520 --> 21:50.440\n it does reasonably the necessary things.\n\n21:50.440 --> 21:52.280\n It's still a C flavored language.\n\n21:52.280 --> 21:55.840\n It's still a braces and semicolon language.\n\n21:55.840 --> 21:59.480\n It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript\n\n21:59.480 --> 22:02.560\n and then understand the roots of where it came from.\n\n22:02.560 --> 22:07.120\n I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing\n\n22:07.120 --> 22:08.840\n for most programs to be written in.\n\n22:08.840 --> 22:11.000\n It's funny that I still, just this morning,\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.200\n I was seeing a Twitter thread\n\n22:13.200 --> 22:15.560\n of a bunch of really senior game dev people\n\n22:15.560 --> 22:18.880\n arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection.\n\n22:18.880 --> 22:21.740\n You will run into some people that are top notch programmers\n\n22:21.740 --> 22:24.640\n that just say, no, this is literally not a good thing.\n\n22:24.640 --> 22:25.840\n Oh, because it makes you lazy?\n\n22:25.840 --> 22:28.440\n Yes, that it makes you not think about things.\n\n22:28.440 --> 22:29.640\n And I do disagree.\n\n22:29.640 --> 22:33.320\n I think that there is so much objective data\n\n22:33.320 --> 22:35.680\n on the vulnerabilities that have happened\n\n22:35.680 --> 22:37.800\n in C and C++ programs,\n\n22:37.800 --> 22:40.100\n sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.\n\n22:40.100 --> 22:42.360\n It's like nobody is good enough to avoid\n\n22:42.360 --> 22:44.200\n ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.\n\n22:44.200 --> 22:45.540\n You write enough C code,\n\n22:45.540 --> 22:47.620\n you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\n22:47.620 --> 22:50.000\n And garbage collection is a very great thing\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.740\n for the vast majority of programs.\n\n22:51.740 --> 22:54.720\n It's only when you get into the tightest of real time things\n\n22:54.720 --> 22:56.500\n that you start saying, it's like, no,\n\n22:56.500 --> 22:58.320\n the garbage collection has more costs\n\n22:58.320 --> 22:59.940\n than it has benefits for me there,\n\n22:59.940 --> 23:02.560\n but that's not 99 plus percent\n\n23:02.560 --> 23:04.840\n of all the software in the world.\n\n23:04.840 --> 23:09.360\n So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways.\n\n23:09.360 --> 23:14.120\n And so much of programming is not the language itself.\n\n23:14.120 --> 23:17.400\n It's the infrastructure around that surrounds it.\n\n23:17.400 --> 23:19.040\n All the libraries that you can get\n\n23:19.040 --> 23:20.480\n and the different stuff that you can,\n\n23:20.480 --> 23:22.480\n ways you can deploy it,\n\n23:22.480 --> 23:24.200\n the portability that it gives you.\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:27.080\n And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things\n\n23:27.080 --> 23:31.120\n where for a long time, and it still does if I look at it,\n\n23:31.120 --> 23:34.020\n the web stack about everything that has to go\n\n23:34.020 --> 23:36.460\n when you do something really trivial in JavaScript\n\n23:36.460 --> 23:38.420\n and it shows up on a web browser\n\n23:38.420 --> 23:40.360\n to kind of X ray through that\n\n23:40.360 --> 23:42.280\n and see everything that has to happen\n\n23:42.280 --> 23:44.680\n for your one little JavaScript statement\n\n23:44.680 --> 23:48.280\n to turn into something visible in your web browser,\n\n23:48.280 --> 23:51.160\n it's very, very disquieting,\n\n23:51.160 --> 23:53.360\n just the depth of that stack\n\n23:53.360 --> 23:56.840\n and the fact that so few people can even comprehend\n\n23:56.840 --> 23:59.440\n all of the levels that are going on there.\n\n23:59.440 --> 24:02.320\n But it's again, I have to caution myself\n\n24:02.320 --> 24:05.540\n to not be the in the good old days old man about it\n\n24:05.540 --> 24:08.760\n because clearly there's enormous value here.\n\n24:08.760 --> 24:11.180\n The world does run on JavaScript\n\n24:11.180 --> 24:13.280\n to a pretty good approximation there\n\n24:13.280 --> 24:14.720\n and it's not falling apart.\n\n24:14.720 --> 24:16.100\n There's a bunch of scary stuff\n\n24:16.100 --> 24:18.400\n where you look at console logs\n\n24:18.400 --> 24:20.940\n and you just see all of these bad things that are happening\n\n24:20.940 --> 24:22.560\n but it's still kind of limping along\n\n24:22.560 --> 24:24.760\n and nobody really notices.\n\n24:24.760 --> 24:28.440\n But so much of my systems design\n\n24:28.440 --> 24:30.720\n and systems analysis goes around.\n\n24:30.720 --> 24:32.920\n You should understand what the speed of light is,\n\n24:32.920 --> 24:36.120\n like what would be the best you could possibly do here.\n\n24:36.120 --> 24:39.400\n And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases,\n\n24:39.400 --> 24:42.720\n you can be a thousand times off your speed of light,\n\n24:42.720 --> 24:45.520\n velocity for something and it's still be okay.\n\n24:45.520 --> 24:48.360\n And in fact, it can even sometimes still be\n\n24:48.360 --> 24:51.120\n the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint\n\n24:51.120 --> 24:52.700\n where there's a lot of things\n\n24:52.700 --> 24:55.640\n that you don't wanna have to parachute in someone like me\n\n24:55.640 --> 24:59.880\n to go in and say, make this webpage run\n\n24:59.880 --> 25:01.560\n a thousand times faster,\n\n25:01.560 --> 25:05.320\n make this web app into a hardcore native application\n\n25:05.320 --> 25:08.020\n that starts up in 37 milliseconds\n\n25:08.020 --> 25:11.240\n and everything responds in less than one frame latency.\n\n25:11.240 --> 25:12.680\n That's just not necessary.\n\n25:12.680 --> 25:15.440\n And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars\n\n25:15.440 --> 25:16.680\n to do software like that,\n\n25:16.680 --> 25:19.040\n when they can take somebody right out of a bootcamp\n\n25:19.040 --> 25:21.960\n and say, spin up an application for this.\n\n25:21.960 --> 25:26.960\n Often being efficient is not really the best metric.\n\n25:26.960 --> 25:29.260\n And it's like, that applies in a lot of areas\n\n25:29.260 --> 25:32.680\n where it's kind of interesting how a lot of our appliances\n\n25:32.680 --> 25:36.360\n and everything are all built around energy efficiency,\n\n25:36.360 --> 25:39.400\n sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways\n\n25:39.400 --> 25:41.160\n or higher costs in other ways\n\n25:41.160 --> 25:42.960\n where there's interesting things\n\n25:42.960 --> 25:46.080\n where energy or electricity could become much cheaper\n\n25:46.080 --> 25:47.040\n in a future world.\n\n25:47.040 --> 25:49.040\n And that could change our engineering trade offs\n\n25:49.040 --> 25:50.520\n for the way we build certain things\n\n25:50.520 --> 25:53.100\n where you could throw away efficiency\n\n25:53.100 --> 25:56.280\n and actually get more benefits that actually matter.\n\n25:56.280 --> 25:59.320\n I mean, that's one of the directions\n\n25:59.320 --> 26:02.760\n I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy.\n\n26:02.760 --> 26:04.600\n When I was kind of like, what do I wanna do next?\n\n26:04.600 --> 26:08.120\n It was either gonna be cost effective nuclear fission\n\n26:08.120 --> 26:10.520\n or artificial general intelligence.\n\n26:10.520 --> 26:14.680\n And one of my pet ideas there is like,\n\n26:14.680 --> 26:18.400\n people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is.\n\n26:18.400 --> 26:21.400\n And there would be ways that,\n\n26:21.400 --> 26:24.760\n you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less,\n\n26:24.760 --> 26:27.720\n but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper,\n\n26:27.720 --> 26:31.240\n that could be a radical innovation in something like that.\n\n26:31.240 --> 26:32.560\n So there's like some of these thoughts\n\n26:32.560 --> 26:35.520\n around like direct fission energy conversion,\n\n26:35.520 --> 26:36.760\n fission fragment conversion,\n\n26:36.760 --> 26:38.480\n that maybe you build something\n\n26:38.480 --> 26:40.920\n that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything,\n\n26:40.920 --> 26:42.720\n even if it winds up being less efficient.\n\n26:42.720 --> 26:45.060\n So that applies a lot in programming\n\n26:45.060 --> 26:49.180\n where it's always good to know what you could do.\n\n26:49.180 --> 26:52.040\n If you really sat down and took it far,\n\n26:52.040 --> 26:53.760\n because sometimes there's discontinuities\n\n26:53.760 --> 26:56.120\n like around user reaction times,\n\n26:56.120 --> 26:59.200\n there are some points where the difference between\n\n26:59.200 --> 27:02.920\n operating in one second and 750 milliseconds,\n\n27:02.920 --> 27:03.920\n not that huge.\n\n27:03.920 --> 27:05.680\n You'll see it in webpage statistics,\n\n27:05.680 --> 27:08.260\n but most of the usability stuff, not that great.\n\n27:08.260 --> 27:11.000\n But if you get down to 50 milliseconds,\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.200\n then all of a sudden this just feels amazing.\n\n27:13.200 --> 27:15.480\n It's just like doing your bidding instantly\n\n27:15.480 --> 27:17.240\n rather than you're giving it a command,\n\n27:17.240 --> 27:19.760\n twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.\n\n27:19.760 --> 27:23.080\n So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard\n\n27:23.080 --> 27:25.040\n to get over some threshold,\n\n27:25.040 --> 27:28.920\n but there are broad basins in the value metric\n\n27:28.920 --> 27:31.260\n for lots of work where it just doesn't pay\n\n27:31.260 --> 27:33.000\n to even go that extra mile.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:36.320\n And there are craftsmen that just don't wanna buy that\n\n27:36.320 --> 27:37.880\n and more power to them.\n\n27:37.880 --> 27:39.120\n If somebody just wants to say,\n\n27:39.120 --> 27:42.760\n no, I'm going to be, my pride is in my work,\n\n27:42.760 --> 27:44.080\n I'm never going to do something\n\n27:44.080 --> 27:46.400\n that's not as good as I could possibly make it,\n\n27:46.400 --> 27:50.120\n I respect that and sometimes I am that person,\n\n27:50.120 --> 27:53.840\n but I try to focus more on the larger value picture\n\n27:53.840 --> 27:55.280\n and you do pick your battles\n\n27:55.280 --> 27:57.400\n and you deploy your resources in the play\n\n27:57.400 --> 28:00.720\n that's going to give you the best user value in the end.\n\n28:00.720 --> 28:04.680\n Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth\n\n28:04.680 --> 28:08.620\n as a kind of programming effort,\n\n28:10.840 --> 28:13.320\n it seems like efficiency isn't the thing\n\n28:13.320 --> 28:15.180\n that's being optimized for.\n\n28:15.180 --> 28:17.220\n Like natural selection is very inefficient,\n\n28:17.220 --> 28:21.580\n but it kind of adapts and through the process\n\n28:21.580 --> 28:24.320\n of adaptations building more and more complex systems\n\n28:24.320 --> 28:25.440\n that are more and more intelligent,\n\n28:25.440 --> 28:28.320\n the final result is kind of pretty interesting.\n\n28:28.320 --> 28:30.960\n And so I think of JavaScript the same way.\n\n28:30.960 --> 28:33.040\n It's like this giant mess\n\n28:33.040 --> 28:36.480\n that things naturally die off if they don't work\n\n28:36.480 --> 28:39.440\n and if they become useful to people,\n\n28:39.440 --> 28:40.900\n they kind of naturally live\n\n28:40.900 --> 28:42.880\n and then you build this community,\n\n28:42.880 --> 28:45.940\n large community of people that are generating code\n\n28:45.940 --> 28:48.160\n and some code is sticky, some is not\n\n28:48.160 --> 28:52.480\n and nobody knows the inefficiencies or the efficiencies\n\n28:52.480 --> 28:54.920\n or the breaking points, like how reliable this code is\n\n28:54.920 --> 28:57.820\n and you kind of just run it, assume it works\n\n28:57.820 --> 29:00.440\n and then get unpleasantly surprised\n\n29:00.440 --> 29:03.160\n and then that's very kind of the evolutionary process.\n\n29:03.160 --> 29:04.980\n So that's a really good analogy\n\n29:04.980 --> 29:06.840\n and we can go a lot of places with that\n\n29:06.840 --> 29:09.540\n where in the earliest days of programming,\n\n29:09.540 --> 29:11.920\n when you had finite, you could count the bytes\n\n29:11.920 --> 29:13.080\n that you had to work on this,\n\n29:13.080 --> 29:15.980\n you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf\n\n29:15.980 --> 29:17.400\n to be one less instruction\n\n29:17.400 --> 29:19.600\n than the other person's multiply routine\n\n29:19.600 --> 29:22.880\n to kind of get through and it was so perfectly crafted.\n\n29:22.880 --> 29:26.500\n It was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program\n\n29:26.500 --> 29:28.460\n because there just were not that many,\n\n29:28.460 --> 29:31.320\n you couldn't afford to be lazy in different ways\n\n29:31.320 --> 29:34.760\n and in many ways I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work\n\n29:34.760 --> 29:38.480\n where again, if you did not have the resources to just say,\n\n29:38.480 --> 29:40.600\n well, we're gonna do billions and billions\n\n29:40.600 --> 29:42.680\n of programmable weights here,\n\n29:42.680 --> 29:44.500\n you have to turn it down into something\n\n29:44.500 --> 29:47.400\n that is symbolic and crafted like that\n\n29:47.400 --> 29:51.140\n but that's definitely not the way DNA and life\n\n29:51.140 --> 29:54.160\n and biological evolution and things work.\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:58.360\n On the one hand, it's almost humbling\n\n29:58.360 --> 30:00.920\n how little programming code is in our bodies.\n\n30:00.920 --> 30:02.540\n We've got a couple of billion base pairs\n\n30:02.540 --> 30:05.680\n and it's like this all fits on a thumb drive for years now\n\n30:05.680 --> 30:08.380\n and then our brains are even a smaller section of that.\n\n30:08.380 --> 30:10.000\n You've got maybe 50 megabytes\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:13.720\n and this is not like Shannon Limit perfectly\n\n30:13.720 --> 30:17.480\n information dense conveyances here.\n\n30:17.480 --> 30:19.480\n It's like these are messy codes,\n\n30:19.480 --> 30:21.520\n they're broken up into amino acids.\n\n30:21.520 --> 30:23.960\n A lot of them don't do important things\n\n30:23.960 --> 30:26.360\n or they do things in very awkward ways\n\n30:26.360 --> 30:29.160\n but it is this process of just accumulation\n\n30:29.160 --> 30:33.320\n on top of things and you need scale,\n\n30:33.320 --> 30:36.880\n both you need scale for the population for that to work out\n\n30:36.880 --> 30:39.880\n and in the early days in the 50s and 60s,\n\n30:39.880 --> 30:42.660\n the kind of ancient era of computers\n\n30:42.660 --> 30:44.560\n where you could count when they say like\n\n30:44.560 --> 30:46.240\n when the internet started even in the 70s,\n\n30:46.240 --> 30:48.180\n there were like 18 hosts or something on it.\n\n30:48.180 --> 30:50.440\n It was this small finite number\n\n30:50.440 --> 30:52.260\n and you were still optimizing everything\n\n30:52.260 --> 30:54.560\n to be as good as you possibly could be\n\n30:54.560 --> 30:57.760\n but now it's billions and billions of devices\n\n30:57.760 --> 31:00.360\n and everything going on and you can have\n\n31:00.360 --> 31:03.560\n this very much natural evolution going on\n\n31:03.560 --> 31:06.000\n where lots of things are tried,\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.360\n lots of things are blowing up,\n\n31:07.360 --> 31:09.440\n venture capitalists lose their money\n\n31:09.440 --> 31:11.840\n when a startup invested in the wrong tech stack\n\n31:11.840 --> 31:14.820\n and things completely failed or failed the scale\n\n31:14.820 --> 31:17.440\n but good things do come out of it\n\n31:17.440 --> 31:21.060\n and it's interesting to see the mimetic evolution\n\n31:21.060 --> 31:22.680\n of the way different things happen\n\n31:22.680 --> 31:24.440\n like mentioning hello world at the beginning.\n\n31:24.440 --> 31:26.480\n It's funny how some little thing like that\n\n31:26.480 --> 31:29.640\n where everybody, every programmer knows hello world now\n\n31:29.640 --> 31:32.140\n and that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision\n\n31:32.140 --> 31:35.600\n that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C\n\n31:35.600 --> 31:38.440\n and early examples of things like that.\n\n31:38.440 --> 31:42.340\n So millions of experiments are going on all the time\n\n31:42.340 --> 31:44.840\n but some things do kind of rise to the top\n\n31:44.840 --> 31:48.240\n and win the fitness war for whether it's mind space\n\n31:48.240 --> 31:50.400\n or programming techniques or anything.\n\n31:50.400 --> 31:54.400\n Like there's a site on Stack Exchange called CodeGolf\n\n31:54.400 --> 31:57.960\n where people compete to write the shortest possible program\n\n31:57.960 --> 32:00.320\n for a particular task in all the different kinds\n\n32:00.320 --> 32:03.040\n of languages and it's really interesting to see\n\n32:04.880 --> 32:09.880\n folks kind of, they're masters of their craft,\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:13.460\n really play with the limits of programming languages.\n\n32:13.460 --> 32:14.600\n It's really beautiful to see\n\n32:14.600 --> 32:17.040\n and across all the different programming languages,\n\n32:17.040 --> 32:20.600\n you get to see some of these weird programming languages\n\n32:20.600 --> 32:25.080\n and mainstream ones, difference between Python 2 and 3,\n\n32:25.080 --> 32:27.680\n you get to see the difference between C and C++ and Java\n\n32:27.680 --> 32:30.000\n and you get to see JavaScript, all of that\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:35.000\n and it's kind of inspiring to see how much depth\n\n32:38.120 --> 32:41.040\n of possibility there is within programming languages\n\n32:41.040 --> 32:44.160\n that CodeGolf kind of tasks reveal.\n\n32:44.160 --> 32:46.560\n Most of us, if you do any kind of programming,\n\n32:46.560 --> 32:51.120\n you kind of do boring kind of very vanilla type of code.\n\n32:51.120 --> 32:52.840\n That's the way to build large systems\n\n32:52.840 --> 32:54.700\n but it's nice to see that the possibility\n\n32:54.700 --> 32:57.600\n of creative genius is still within those languages.\n\n32:57.600 --> 33:00.100\n It's laden within those languages.\n\n33:00.100 --> 33:03.180\n So given that you are once again,\n\n33:03.180 --> 33:05.680\n one of the greatest programmers ever,\n\n33:05.680 --> 33:08.320\n what do you think makes a good programmer?\n\n33:08.320 --> 33:10.960\n Maybe a good modern programmer.\n\n33:10.960 --> 33:15.680\n So I just gave a long rant slash lecture at Meta\n\n33:15.680 --> 33:20.440\n to the TPM organization and my biggest point was\n\n33:20.440 --> 33:23.280\n everything that we're doing really should flow\n\n33:23.280 --> 33:26.120\n from user value, all the good things that we're doing.\n\n33:26.120 --> 33:28.440\n It's like, we're not technical people.\n\n33:28.440 --> 33:30.960\n It's like, you shouldn't be taking pride\n\n33:30.960 --> 33:32.080\n just in the specific thing.\n\n33:32.080 --> 33:34.880\n Like CodeGolf is the sort of thing, it's a fun puzzle game\n\n33:34.880 --> 33:38.160\n but that really should not be a major motivator for you.\n\n33:38.160 --> 33:40.260\n It's like, we're solving problems for people\n\n33:40.260 --> 33:41.960\n or we're providing entertainment to people.\n\n33:41.960 --> 33:44.160\n We're doing something of value to people\n\n33:44.160 --> 33:46.240\n that's displacing something else in their life.\n\n33:46.240 --> 33:49.000\n So we wanna be providing a net value\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.360\n over what they could be doing\n\n33:51.360 --> 33:53.520\n but instead they're choosing to use our products.\n\n33:53.520 --> 33:56.640\n And that's where, I mean, it sounds trite or corny\n\n33:56.640 --> 33:59.200\n but I fundamentally do think that's how you make\n\n33:59.200 --> 34:00.360\n the world a better place.\n\n34:00.360 --> 34:02.900\n If you have given more value to people\n\n34:02.900 --> 34:05.720\n than it took you and your team to create,\n\n34:05.720 --> 34:07.560\n then the world's a better place.\n\n34:07.560 --> 34:10.500\n People have, they've gone from something of lesser value,\n\n34:10.500 --> 34:11.980\n chosen to use your product\n\n34:11.980 --> 34:13.880\n and their life feels better for that.\n\n34:13.880 --> 34:16.280\n And if you've produced that economically,\n\n34:16.280 --> 34:18.520\n that's a really good thing.\n\n34:19.480 --> 34:22.800\n On the other hand, if you spent ridiculous amounts of money\n\n34:22.800 --> 34:24.340\n you've just kind of shoveled a lot of cash\n\n34:24.340 --> 34:25.720\n into a wood chipper there\n\n34:25.720 --> 34:28.160\n and you should maybe not feel so good\n\n34:28.160 --> 34:29.720\n about what you're doing.\n\n34:29.720 --> 34:33.560\n So being proud about like a specific architecture\n\n34:33.560 --> 34:36.440\n or a specific technology or a specific code sequence\n\n34:36.440 --> 34:39.160\n that you've done, it's great to get a little smile\n\n34:39.160 --> 34:41.140\n like a tiny little dopamine hit for that\n\n34:41.140 --> 34:43.340\n but the top level metrics should be\n\n34:43.340 --> 34:45.440\n that you're building things of value.\n\n34:45.440 --> 34:48.040\n Now you can get into the argument about how you,\n\n34:48.040 --> 34:49.360\n what is user value?\n\n34:49.360 --> 34:51.240\n How do you actually quantify that?\n\n34:51.240 --> 34:53.360\n And there can be big arguments about that\n\n34:53.360 --> 34:55.120\n but it's easy to be able to say,\n\n34:55.120 --> 34:57.900\n okay, this pissed off user there is not getting value\n\n34:57.900 --> 34:59.080\n from what you're doing.\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:01.980\n This user over there with the big smile on their face,\n\n35:01.980 --> 35:04.240\n the moment of delight when something happened,\n\n35:04.240 --> 35:05.900\n there's a value that's happened there.\n\n35:05.900 --> 35:07.720\n I mean, you have to at least accept\n\n35:07.720 --> 35:09.840\n that there is a concept of user value\n\n35:09.840 --> 35:12.880\n even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it,\n\n35:12.880 --> 35:15.480\n you can usually make relative arguments about it.\n\n35:15.480 --> 35:18.860\n Well, this was better than this, we've improved things.\n\n35:18.860 --> 35:23.720\n So being a servant to the user is your job\n\n35:23.720 --> 35:26.680\n when you're a developer, you wanna be producing something\n\n35:26.680 --> 35:30.000\n that other people are gonna find valuable.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.540\n And if you are technically inclined\n\n35:32.540 --> 35:35.760\n then finding the right levers to be able to pull\n\n35:35.760 --> 35:39.080\n to be able to make a design that's going to produce\n\n35:39.080 --> 35:41.680\n the most value for the least amount of effort.\n\n35:41.680 --> 35:44.000\n And it always has to be kind of divided,\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.940\n there's a ratio there where you,\n\n35:45.940 --> 35:48.080\n it's a problem at the big tech companies,\n\n35:48.080 --> 35:52.240\n whether it's Meta Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,\n\n35:52.240 --> 35:55.320\n companies that have almost infinite money.\n\n35:55.320 --> 35:57.720\n I mean, I know their CFO will complain\n\n35:57.720 --> 35:58.840\n that it's not infinite money\n\n35:58.840 --> 36:00.640\n but from most developers standpoints\n\n36:00.640 --> 36:02.680\n it really does feel like it.\n\n36:02.680 --> 36:04.880\n And it's almost counterintuitive\n\n36:04.880 --> 36:07.960\n that if you're working hard as a developer on something,\n\n36:07.960 --> 36:08.820\n there's always this thought,\n\n36:08.820 --> 36:12.360\n if only I had more resources, more people, more RAM,\n\n36:12.360 --> 36:16.400\n more megahertz, then my product will be better.\n\n36:16.400 --> 36:19.600\n And that sense that at certain points, it's certainly true\n\n36:19.600 --> 36:22.080\n that if you are really hamstrung by this,\n\n36:22.080 --> 36:25.200\n removing an obstacle will make a better product,\n\n36:25.200 --> 36:26.980\n make more value.\n\n36:26.980 --> 36:30.120\n But if you're not making your core design decisions\n\n36:30.120 --> 36:33.080\n in this fiercely competitive way\n\n36:33.080 --> 36:35.780\n where you're saying feature A or feature B,\n\n36:35.780 --> 36:38.680\n you can't just say, let's do both.\n\n36:38.680 --> 36:41.160\n Because then you're not making a value judgment about them.\n\n36:41.160 --> 36:43.000\n You're just saying, well, they both seem good.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.200\n I don't wanna necessarily have to pick out\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:47.460\n which one is better or how much better\n\n36:47.460 --> 36:51.020\n and tell team B that, sorry, we're not gonna do this\n\n36:51.020 --> 36:53.160\n because A is more important.\n\n36:53.160 --> 36:57.120\n But that notion of always having to really critically value\n\n36:57.120 --> 36:59.720\n what you're doing, your time, the resources you expend,\n\n36:59.720 --> 37:02.620\n even the opportunity cost of doing something else,\n\n37:02.620 --> 37:04.840\n that's super important.\n\n37:04.840 --> 37:07.600\n Well, let me ask you about the big debates\n\n37:07.600 --> 37:09.980\n that you're mentioning of how to measure value.\n\n37:12.120 --> 37:15.620\n Is it possible to measure it kind of numerically\n\n37:19.400 --> 37:22.120\n or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive,\n\n37:22.120 --> 37:25.120\n the designer route of imagining\n\n37:26.020 --> 37:28.720\n sort of somebody using a thing\n\n37:28.720 --> 37:30.840\n and imagining a smile on their face,\n\n37:30.840 --> 37:34.000\n imagining the experience of love and joy\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:35.980\n that you have when you use the thing.\n\n37:35.980 --> 37:37.320\n That's from a design perspective\n\n37:37.320 --> 37:40.440\n or if you're building more like a lower level thing\n\n37:40.440 --> 37:43.400\n for like Linux, you imagine a developer\n\n37:43.400 --> 37:45.440\n that might come across this and use it\n\n37:45.440 --> 37:50.440\n and become happy and better off because of it.\n\n37:50.440 --> 37:52.620\n So where do you land on those things?\n\n37:52.620 --> 37:53.680\n Is it measurable?\n\n37:53.680 --> 37:57.280\n So I imagine like Meta and Google\n\n37:57.280 --> 37:58.920\n will probably try to measure the thing.\n\n37:58.920 --> 38:01.520\n They'll try to, it's like you try to optimize engagement\n\n38:01.520 --> 38:03.240\n or something, let's measure engagement.\n\n38:03.240 --> 38:05.360\n And then I think there is a kind of,\n\n38:05.360 --> 38:09.360\n I mean, I admire the designer ethic of like,\n\n38:09.360 --> 38:13.000\n think of a future that's immeasurable\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.320\n and you try to make somebody in that future\n\n38:15.320 --> 38:17.320\n that's different from today happy.\n\n38:17.320 --> 38:20.440\n So I do usually favor,\n\n38:20.440 --> 38:23.800\n if you can get any kind of a metric that's good,\n\n38:23.800 --> 38:25.840\n by all means, listen to the data.\n\n38:25.840 --> 38:28.480\n But you can go too far there where we've had problems\n\n38:28.480 --> 38:30.640\n where it's like, hey, we had a performance regression\n\n38:30.640 --> 38:33.280\n because our fancy new telemetry system\n\n38:33.280 --> 38:36.000\n is doing a bazillion file writes\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.200\n to kind of archive this stuff\n\n38:37.200 --> 38:38.740\n because we needed to collect information\n\n38:38.740 --> 38:40.600\n to determine if we were doing,\n\n38:40.600 --> 38:42.600\n if our plans were good.\n\n38:42.600 --> 38:45.540\n So when information is available,\n\n38:45.540 --> 38:46.720\n you should never ignore it.\n\n38:46.720 --> 38:47.560\n I mean, all of it.\n\n38:47.560 --> 38:49.680\n For actual users using the thing,\n\n38:49.680 --> 38:51.400\n human beings using the thing,\n\n38:51.400 --> 38:52.880\n large number of human beings,\n\n38:52.880 --> 38:54.720\n and you get to see sort of a lot of large numbers.\n\n38:54.720 --> 38:55.920\n So there's the zero to one problem\n\n38:55.920 --> 38:57.560\n of when you're doing something really new,\n\n38:57.560 --> 38:59.280\n you do kind of have to make a guess.\n\n38:59.280 --> 39:02.000\n But one of the points that I've been making at Meta\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:05.120\n is we have more than enough users now\n\n39:05.120 --> 39:08.440\n that anything somebody wants to try in VR,\n\n39:08.440 --> 39:10.780\n we have users that will be interested in that.\n\n39:10.780 --> 39:13.080\n You do not get to make a completely\n\n39:13.080 --> 39:15.820\n greenfield blue sky pitch and say,\n\n39:15.820 --> 39:18.660\n I'm going to do this because I think it might be interesting.\n\n39:18.660 --> 39:20.120\n I challenge everyone.\n\n39:20.120 --> 39:21.640\n There are going to be people,\n\n39:21.640 --> 39:24.200\n whether it's working in VR on your,\n\n39:24.200 --> 39:26.880\n like on your desktop replacement\n\n39:26.880 --> 39:29.560\n or communicating with people in different ways\n\n39:29.560 --> 39:31.640\n or playing the games.\n\n39:31.640 --> 39:35.120\n There are going to be probably millions of people,\n\n39:35.120 --> 39:37.200\n or at least if you pick some tiny niche\n\n39:37.200 --> 39:38.660\n that we're not in right now,\n\n39:38.660 --> 39:40.820\n there's still going to be thousands of people out there\n\n39:40.820 --> 39:43.860\n that have the headsets that would be your target market.\n\n39:43.860 --> 39:46.060\n And I tell people, pay attention to them.\n\n39:46.060 --> 39:47.680\n Don't invent fictional users.\n\n39:47.680 --> 39:50.240\n Don't make an Alice Bob Charlie\n\n39:50.240 --> 39:53.580\n that fits whatever matrix of tendencies\n\n39:53.580 --> 39:55.360\n that you want to break the market down to,\n\n39:55.360 --> 39:58.320\n because it's a mistake to think about imaginary users\n\n39:58.320 --> 40:01.920\n when you've got real users that you could be working with.\n\n40:01.920 --> 40:03.080\n But on the other hand,\n\n40:03.080 --> 40:07.000\n there is value to having a kind of wholeness\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.520\n of vision for a product.\n\n40:09.520 --> 40:13.680\n And companies like Meta have,\n\n40:13.680 --> 40:16.520\n they understand the trade offs where you can have a company\n\n40:16.520 --> 40:20.240\n like SpaceX or Apple in the Steve Jobs era,\n\n40:20.240 --> 40:23.360\n where you have a very powerful leading personality\n\n40:23.360 --> 40:26.700\n that can micromanage at a very low level\n\n40:26.700 --> 40:29.360\n and can say it's like, no, that handle needs to be different\n\n40:29.360 --> 40:32.760\n or that icon needs to change the tint there.\n\n40:32.760 --> 40:34.960\n And they clearly get a lot of value out of it.\n\n40:34.960 --> 40:37.200\n They also burn through a lot of employees\n\n40:37.200 --> 40:39.000\n that have horror stories to tell\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.680\n about working there afterwards.\n\n40:41.680 --> 40:45.120\n My position is that you're at your best\n\n40:45.120 --> 40:48.120\n when you've got a leader that is at their limit\n\n40:48.120 --> 40:49.760\n of what they can kind of comprehend\n\n40:49.760 --> 40:51.480\n of everything below them.\n\n40:51.480 --> 40:53.440\n And they can have an informed opinion\n\n40:53.440 --> 40:55.360\n about everything that's going on.\n\n40:55.360 --> 40:57.480\n And you take somebody, you've got to believe\n\n40:57.480 --> 41:01.100\n that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience,\n\n41:01.100 --> 41:02.680\n you would hope that they've got wisdom\n\n41:02.680 --> 41:06.160\n that the just out of bootcamp person contributing\n\n41:06.160 --> 41:07.000\n doesn't have.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.140\n And that if they're like, well, that's wrong there,\n\n41:09.140 --> 41:10.600\n you probably shouldn't do it that way\n\n41:10.600 --> 41:14.120\n or even just don't do it that way, do it another way.\n\n41:14.120 --> 41:15.500\n So there's value there,\n\n41:15.500 --> 41:17.840\n but it can't go beyond a certain level.\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:21.360\n I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories of him saying things\n\n41:21.360 --> 41:23.060\n that are just wrong right in front of me\n\n41:23.060 --> 41:25.840\n about technical things because he was not operating\n\n41:25.840 --> 41:26.880\n at that level.\n\n41:28.460 --> 41:30.480\n But when it does work and you do get\n\n41:30.480 --> 41:32.020\n that kind of passionate leader\n\n41:32.020 --> 41:34.120\n that's thinking about the entire product\n\n41:34.120 --> 41:35.840\n and just really deeply cares\n\n41:35.840 --> 41:39.060\n about not letting anything slip through the cracks,\n\n41:39.060 --> 41:40.560\n I think that's got a lot of value.\n\n41:40.560 --> 41:42.520\n But the other side of that is the people saying that,\n\n41:42.520 --> 41:44.520\n well, we wanna have these independent teams\n\n41:44.520 --> 41:46.040\n that are bubbling up the ideas\n\n41:46.040 --> 41:49.480\n because it's almost it's anti capitalist\n\n41:49.480 --> 41:50.940\n or anti free market to say,\n\n41:50.940 --> 41:53.240\n it's like I want my grand, my great leader\n\n41:53.240 --> 41:55.240\n to go ahead and dictate all these points there\n\n41:55.240 --> 41:57.680\n where clearly free markets bring up things\n\n41:57.680 --> 41:59.360\n that you don't expect.\n\n41:59.360 --> 42:01.800\n Like in VR, we saw a bunch of things\n\n42:01.800 --> 42:03.080\n like it didn't turn out at all\n\n42:03.080 --> 42:04.320\n the way the early people thought\n\n42:04.320 --> 42:06.040\n were gonna be the key applications\n\n42:06.040 --> 42:08.800\n and things that would not have been approved\n\n42:08.800 --> 42:12.260\n by the dark cabal making the decisions\n\n42:12.260 --> 42:14.680\n about what gets into the store turn out\n\n42:14.680 --> 42:17.640\n to in some cases be extremely successful.\n\n42:17.640 --> 42:20.460\n So yeah, I definitely kind of wanted to be,\n\n42:20.460 --> 42:22.200\n there was a point where I did make a pitch.\n\n42:22.200 --> 42:23.840\n It's like, hey, make me VR dictator\n\n42:23.840 --> 42:25.480\n and I'll go in and get shit done.\n\n42:25.480 --> 42:28.600\n I am, and that's just, it's not in the culture at Meta.\n\n42:28.600 --> 42:31.640\n You know, and they understand the trade offs they,\n\n42:31.640 --> 42:32.960\n and that's just not the way,\n\n42:32.960 --> 42:34.500\n that's not the company that they want,\n\n42:34.500 --> 42:37.240\n the team that they wanna do.\n\n42:37.240 --> 42:40.120\n It's fascinating because VR and we'll talk about it more.\n\n42:40.120 --> 42:43.040\n It's still unclear to me\n\n42:44.260 --> 42:46.920\n in what way VR will change the world\n\n42:46.920 --> 42:48.520\n because it does seem clear that VR\n\n42:48.520 --> 42:51.720\n will somehow fundamentally transform this world\n\n42:51.720 --> 42:54.840\n and it's unclear to me how yet.\n\n42:54.840 --> 42:56.880\n Let me know when you wanna get into that.\n\n42:56.880 --> 42:57.720\n Who will?\n\n42:57.720 --> 42:58.540\n Well, hold on a second.\n\n42:58.540 --> 43:02.760\n So in the stick to the you being the best programmer ever.\n\n43:02.760 --> 43:05.200\n Okay, in the early days when you didn't have,\n\n43:05.200 --> 43:07.080\n when you didn't have adult responsibilities\n\n43:07.080 --> 43:09.320\n of leading teams and all that kind of stuff\n\n43:09.320 --> 43:13.200\n and you can focus on just being a programmer,\n\n43:13.200 --> 43:15.880\n what did the productive day in the life\n\n43:15.880 --> 43:17.760\n of John Carmack look like?\n\n43:17.760 --> 43:19.200\n How many hours is the keyboard?\n\n43:19.200 --> 43:20.520\n How much sleep?\n\n43:20.520 --> 43:24.280\n What was the source of calories that fueled the brain?\n\n43:24.280 --> 43:25.200\n What was it like?\n\n43:25.200 --> 43:26.960\n What times did you wake up?\n\n43:26.960 --> 43:29.500\n So I was able to be remarkably consistent\n\n43:29.500 --> 43:32.100\n about what was good working conditions for me\n\n43:32.100 --> 43:33.540\n for a very long time.\n\n43:34.800 --> 43:36.800\n I was never one of the programmers\n\n43:37.800 --> 43:40.100\n that would do all nighters going through work\n\n43:40.100 --> 43:41.220\n for 20 hours straight.\n\n43:41.220 --> 43:43.840\n It's like my brain generally starts turning to mush\n\n43:43.840 --> 43:45.860\n after 12 hours or so.\n\n43:45.860 --> 43:48.940\n But the hard work is really important\n\n43:48.940 --> 43:51.180\n and I would work for decades.\n\n43:51.180 --> 43:52.700\n I would work 60 hours a week.\n\n43:52.700 --> 43:55.260\n I would work a 10 hour day, six days a week\n\n43:55.260 --> 43:58.060\n and try to be productive at that.\n\n43:58.060 --> 44:00.100\n Now my schedule shifted around a fair amount\n\n44:00.100 --> 44:02.260\n when I was young without any kids\n\n44:02.260 --> 44:04.020\n and any other responsibilities.\n\n44:04.020 --> 44:06.300\n I was on one of those cycling schedules\n\n44:06.300 --> 44:08.620\n where I'd kind of get in an hour later each day\n\n44:08.620 --> 44:11.100\n and roll around through the entire time\n\n44:11.100 --> 44:13.860\n and I'd wind up kind of pulling in at two or three\n\n44:13.860 --> 44:16.220\n in the afternoon sometimes and then working again\n\n44:16.220 --> 44:19.100\n past midnight or two in the morning.\n\n44:19.100 --> 44:22.900\n And that was, when it was just me trying\n\n44:22.900 --> 44:26.460\n to make things happen and I was usually isolated off\n\n44:26.460 --> 44:30.100\n in my office, people generally didn't bother me much at in\n\n44:30.100 --> 44:34.100\n and I could get a lot of programming work done that way.\n\n44:34.100 --> 44:36.380\n I did settle into a more normal schedule\n\n44:36.380 --> 44:39.500\n when I was taking kids to school and things like that.\n\n44:39.500 --> 44:42.020\n So kids were the forcing function that got you to wake up\n\n44:42.020 --> 44:43.980\n at the same time each day.\n\n44:43.980 --> 44:46.740\n It's not clear to me that there was much of a difference\n\n44:46.740 --> 44:50.740\n in the productivity with that where I kind of feel,\n\n44:50.740 --> 44:52.500\n if I just get up when I feel like it,\n\n44:52.500 --> 44:54.420\n it's usually a little later each day\n\n44:54.420 --> 44:57.620\n but I just recently made the focusing decision\n\n44:57.620 --> 44:59.980\n to try to push my schedule back a little bit earlier\n\n44:59.980 --> 45:01.980\n to getting up at eight in the morning\n\n45:01.980 --> 45:04.220\n and trying to shift things around.\n\n45:04.220 --> 45:07.340\n Like I'm often doing experiments with myself\n\n45:07.340 --> 45:10.260\n about what should I be doing to be more productive\n\n45:10.260 --> 45:13.380\n and one of the things that I did realize was happening\n\n45:13.380 --> 45:18.380\n in recent months where I would go for a walk or a run.\n\n45:18.540 --> 45:22.660\n I cover like four miles a day and I would usually do that\n\n45:22.660 --> 45:25.580\n just as the sun's going down here in Texas now\n\n45:25.580 --> 45:27.820\n and it's still really damn hot but I'd go out\n\n45:27.820 --> 45:31.300\n at 8.30 or something and cover the time there\n\n45:31.300 --> 45:34.100\n and then the showering and it was putting a hold in my day\n\n45:34.100 --> 45:36.980\n where I would have still a couple hours after that\n\n45:36.980 --> 45:38.860\n and sometimes my best hours were at night\n\n45:38.860 --> 45:41.300\n when nobody else is around, nobody's bothering me\n\n45:41.300 --> 45:43.420\n but that hole in the day was a problem\n\n45:43.420 --> 45:46.780\n so just a couple weeks ago, I made the change\n\n45:46.780 --> 45:47.620\n to go ahead and say, all right,\n\n45:47.620 --> 45:48.780\n I'm gonna get up a little earlier,\n\n45:48.780 --> 45:51.180\n I'm gonna do a walk or get out there first\n\n45:51.180 --> 45:53.340\n so I can have more uninterrupted time.\n\n45:53.340 --> 45:55.500\n So I'm still playing with factors like this\n\n45:55.500 --> 45:59.340\n as I kind of optimize my work efforts\n\n45:59.340 --> 46:03.060\n but it's always been, it was 60 hours a week\n\n46:03.060 --> 46:04.380\n for a very long time.\n\n46:04.380 --> 46:06.660\n To some degree, I had a little thing in the back of my head\n\n46:06.660 --> 46:08.980\n where I was almost jealous of some of the programmers\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:10.740\n that would do these marathon sessions\n\n46:10.740 --> 46:13.420\n and I had like Dave Taylor, one of the guys that he had,\n\n46:13.420 --> 46:14.580\n he would be one of those people\n\n46:14.580 --> 46:16.580\n that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes\n\n46:16.580 --> 46:19.500\n and all the kind of classic hacker tropes about things\n\n46:19.500 --> 46:22.140\n and a part of me was like always a little bothered\n\n46:22.140 --> 46:25.460\n that that wasn't me, that I wouldn't go program\n\n46:25.460 --> 46:28.300\n 20 hours straight because I'm falling apart\n\n46:28.300 --> 46:31.220\n and not being very effective after 12 hours.\n\n46:31.220 --> 46:32.780\n I mean, yeah, 12 hour programming,\n\n46:32.780 --> 46:34.180\n that's fine when you're doing that\n\n46:34.180 --> 46:38.060\n but it never, you're not doing smart work much after,\n\n46:38.060 --> 46:40.460\n at least I'm not, but there's a range of people.\n\n46:40.460 --> 46:41.980\n I mean, that's something that a lot of people\n\n46:41.980 --> 46:43.860\n don't really get in their gut\n\n46:43.860 --> 46:46.740\n where there are people that work on four hours of sleep\n\n46:46.740 --> 46:48.980\n and are smart and can continue to do good work\n\n46:48.980 --> 46:51.580\n but then there's a lot of people that just fall apart.\n\n46:51.580 --> 46:54.620\n So I do tell people that I always try\n\n46:54.620 --> 46:55.860\n to get eight hours of sleep.\n\n46:55.860 --> 46:58.380\n It's not this, you know, push yourself harder,\n\n46:58.380 --> 47:00.980\n get up earlier, I just do worse work\n\n47:00.980 --> 47:04.140\n where, you know, you can work a hundred hours a week\n\n47:04.140 --> 47:05.740\n and still get eight hours of sleep\n\n47:05.740 --> 47:08.340\n if you just kind of prioritize things correctly\n\n47:08.340 --> 47:11.340\n but I do believe in working hard, working a lot.\n\n47:12.380 --> 47:14.820\n There was a comment that a game dev made\n\n47:14.820 --> 47:18.940\n that I know there's a backlash against really hard work\n\n47:18.940 --> 47:21.620\n in a lot of cases and I get into online arguments\n\n47:21.620 --> 47:24.460\n about this all the time but he was basically saying,\n\n47:24.460 --> 47:27.340\n yeah, 40 hours a week, that's kind of a part time job\n\n47:27.340 --> 47:29.340\n and if you were really in it,\n\n47:29.340 --> 47:31.300\n you're doing what you think is important,\n\n47:31.300 --> 47:34.940\n what you're passionate about, working more gets more done\n\n47:34.940 --> 47:39.180\n and it's just really not possible to argue with that\n\n47:39.180 --> 47:40.500\n if you've been around the people\n\n47:40.500 --> 47:42.740\n that work with that level of intensity\n\n47:42.740 --> 47:45.820\n and just say, it's like, no, they should just stop.\n\n47:45.820 --> 47:49.060\n And we had, I kind of came back around to that\n\n47:49.060 --> 47:51.300\n a couple of years ago where I was using\n\n47:51.300 --> 47:55.060\n the fictional example of, all right, some people say,\n\n47:55.060 --> 47:57.340\n they'll say with a straight face, they think, no,\n\n47:57.340 --> 47:59.300\n you are less productive if you work\n\n47:59.300 --> 48:01.140\n more than 40 hours a week.\n\n48:01.140 --> 48:03.060\n And they're generally misinterpreting things\n\n48:03.060 --> 48:05.860\n where your marginal productivity for an hour\n\n48:05.860 --> 48:08.940\n after eight hours is less than in one of your peak hours\n\n48:08.940 --> 48:11.180\n but you're not literally getting less done.\n\n48:11.180 --> 48:13.260\n There is a point where you start breaking things\n\n48:13.260 --> 48:16.580\n and getting worse behavior and everything out of it\n\n48:16.580 --> 48:18.380\n where you're literally going backwards\n\n48:18.380 --> 48:21.300\n but it's not at eight or 10 or 12 hours.\n\n48:21.300 --> 48:23.660\n And the fictional example I would use was,\n\n48:23.660 --> 48:27.140\n imagine there's an asteroid coming to impact,\n\n48:27.140 --> 48:30.420\n to crash into Earth, destroy all of human life.\n\n48:30.420 --> 48:34.180\n Do you want Elon Musk or the people working at SpaceX\n\n48:34.180 --> 48:35.620\n that are building the interceptor\n\n48:35.620 --> 48:38.460\n that's going to deflect the asteroid,\n\n48:38.460 --> 48:40.180\n do you want them to clock out at five\n\n48:40.180 --> 48:42.700\n because damn it, they're just gonna go do worse work\n\n48:42.700 --> 48:44.780\n if they work another couple hours.\n\n48:44.780 --> 48:47.100\n And it seems absurd.\n\n48:47.100 --> 48:48.580\n And that's a hypothetical though\n\n48:48.580 --> 48:49.940\n and everyone can dismiss that.\n\n48:49.940 --> 48:52.020\n But then when coronavirus was hitting\n\n48:52.020 --> 48:54.580\n and you have all of these medical personnel\n\n48:54.580 --> 48:58.060\n that are clearly pushing themselves really, really hard\n\n48:58.060 --> 48:59.820\n and I'd say, it's like, okay,\n\n48:59.820 --> 49:03.140\n do you want all of these scientists working on treatments\n\n49:03.140 --> 49:05.660\n and vaccines and caring for all of these people?\n\n49:05.660 --> 49:07.700\n Are they really screwing everything up\n\n49:07.700 --> 49:09.780\n by working more than eight hours a day?\n\n49:09.780 --> 49:11.420\n And of course people say, I'm just an asshole\n\n49:11.420 --> 49:15.220\n to say something like that, but it's the truth.\n\n49:15.220 --> 49:17.540\n Working longer gets more done.\n\n49:17.540 --> 49:20.540\n Well, so that's kind of the layer one.\n\n49:20.540 --> 49:22.540\n But I'd like to also say that,\n\n49:22.540 --> 49:25.940\n at least I believe, depending on the person,\n\n49:25.940 --> 49:30.700\n depending on the task, working more and harder\n\n49:30.700 --> 49:35.700\n will make you better for the next week\n\n49:35.980 --> 49:37.660\n in those peak hours.\n\n49:37.660 --> 49:41.380\n So there's something about a deep dedication to a thing\n\n49:42.540 --> 49:44.820\n that kind of gets deep in you.\n\n49:44.820 --> 49:48.220\n So the hard work isn't just about the raw hours\n\n49:48.220 --> 49:53.220\n of productivity, it's the thing it does to you\n\n49:54.220 --> 49:56.780\n in the weeks and months after too.\n\n49:56.780 --> 49:59.100\n You're tempering yourself in some ways.\n\n49:59.100 --> 50:01.940\n And I think, it's like Jiro dreams of sushi.\n\n50:01.940 --> 50:03.820\n If you really dedicate yourself completely\n\n50:03.820 --> 50:08.020\n to making the sushi, to really putting in the long hours,\n\n50:08.020 --> 50:12.540\n day after day after day, you become a true craftsman\n\n50:12.540 --> 50:14.380\n of the thing you're doing.\n\n50:14.380 --> 50:16.300\n Now there's, of course, discussions about\n\n50:16.300 --> 50:18.940\n are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships?\n\n50:18.940 --> 50:21.740\n Are you sacrificing a lot of other possible things\n\n50:21.740 --> 50:22.780\n you could do with that time?\n\n50:22.780 --> 50:27.780\n But if you're talking about purely being a master\n\n50:28.220 --> 50:30.660\n or a craftsman of your art,\n\n50:30.660 --> 50:34.980\n that more hours isn't just about doing more,\n\n50:34.980 --> 50:37.300\n it's about becoming better at the thing you're doing.\n\n50:37.300 --> 50:38.780\n Yeah, and I don't gainsay anybody\n\n50:38.780 --> 50:41.180\n that wants to work the minimum amount.\n\n50:41.180 --> 50:42.980\n They've got other priorities in their life.\n\n50:42.980 --> 50:44.660\n My only argument that I'm making,\n\n50:44.660 --> 50:46.980\n it's not that everybody should work hard,\n\n50:46.980 --> 50:49.380\n it's that if you want to accomplish something,\n\n50:49.380 --> 50:50.820\n working longer and harder\n\n50:50.820 --> 50:53.340\n is the path to getting it accomplished.\n\n50:53.340 --> 50:55.180\n Well, let me ask you about this then,\n\n50:56.180 --> 50:58.900\n the mythical work life balance.\n\n51:01.180 --> 51:03.060\n For an engineer, it seems like\n\n51:03.060 --> 51:07.260\n that's one of the professions for a programmer\n\n51:07.260 --> 51:12.260\n where working hard does lead to greater productivity in it.\n\n51:12.260 --> 51:15.620\n But it also raises the question of\n\n51:17.020 --> 51:19.660\n sort of personal relationships and all that kind of stuff,\n\n51:19.660 --> 51:24.300\n family, and how are you able to find work life balance?\n\n51:24.300 --> 51:25.740\n Is there advice you can give,\n\n51:25.740 --> 51:27.580\n maybe even outside of yourself?\n\n51:27.580 --> 51:29.900\n Have you been able to arrive at any wisdom\n\n51:29.900 --> 51:32.380\n on this part in your years of life?\n\n51:32.380 --> 51:34.580\n I do think that there's a wide range of people\n\n51:34.580 --> 51:36.760\n where different people have different needs.\n\n51:36.760 --> 51:38.660\n It's not a one size fits all.\n\n51:38.660 --> 51:40.740\n I am certainly what works for me.\n\n51:40.740 --> 51:45.140\n I can tell enough that I'm different\n\n51:45.140 --> 51:46.620\n than a typical average person\n\n51:46.620 --> 51:48.620\n in the way things impact me,\n\n51:48.620 --> 51:50.300\n the things that I want to do,\n\n51:50.300 --> 51:51.540\n my goals are different,\n\n51:51.540 --> 51:55.160\n and sort of the levers to impact things are different,\n\n51:55.160 --> 51:59.540\n where I have literally never felt burnout,\n\n51:59.540 --> 52:02.060\n and I know there's lots of brilliant, smart people\n\n52:02.060 --> 52:05.340\n that do world leading work that get burned out,\n\n52:05.340 --> 52:08.060\n and it's never hit me.\n\n52:08.060 --> 52:11.700\n I've never been at a point where I'm like,\n\n52:11.700 --> 52:13.200\n I just don't care about this.\n\n52:13.200 --> 52:14.780\n I don't want to do this anymore.\n\n52:14.780 --> 52:16.420\n But I've always had the flexibility\n\n52:16.420 --> 52:18.900\n to work on lots of interesting things.\n\n52:18.900 --> 52:21.480\n I can always just turn my gaze to something else\n\n52:21.480 --> 52:23.500\n and have a great time working on that.\n\n52:23.500 --> 52:27.140\n And so much of the ability to actually work hard\n\n52:27.140 --> 52:29.620\n is the ability to have multiple things to choose from\n\n52:29.620 --> 52:33.100\n and to use your time on the most appropriate thing.\n\n52:33.100 --> 52:36.940\n There are time periods where it's the best time\n\n52:36.940 --> 52:38.460\n for me to read a new research paper\n\n52:38.460 --> 52:41.380\n that I need to really be thinking hard about it.\n\n52:41.380 --> 52:43.420\n Then there's a time that maybe I should just scan\n\n52:43.420 --> 52:44.760\n and organize my old notes\n\n52:44.760 --> 52:47.160\n because I'm just not on top of things.\n\n52:47.160 --> 52:48.420\n Then there's the time that,\n\n52:48.420 --> 52:51.520\n all right, let's go bang out a few hundred lines of code\n\n52:51.520 --> 52:52.700\n for something.\n\n52:52.700 --> 52:57.180\n So switching between them has been real valuable.\n\n52:57.180 --> 52:59.780\n So you'll always have kind of joy in your heart\n\n52:59.780 --> 53:01.000\n for all the things you're doing,\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.260\n and that is a kind of work life balance\n\n53:03.260 --> 53:04.820\n as a first sort of step.\n\n53:04.820 --> 53:06.420\n Yeah, I do. So you're always happy.\n\n53:06.420 --> 53:07.260\n I do.\n\n53:07.260 --> 53:08.460\n Well, happy.\n\n53:08.460 --> 53:10.420\n Yeah, I mean, that's like a lot of people would say\n\n53:10.420 --> 53:12.580\n that often I look like kind of a grim person,\n\n53:12.580 --> 53:15.100\n you know, with just sitting there with a neutral expression\n\n53:15.100 --> 53:17.500\n or even like knitted brows and a frown on my face\n\n53:17.500 --> 53:18.980\n as I'm staring at something.\n\n53:18.980 --> 53:20.660\n That's what happiness looks like for you.\n\n53:20.660 --> 53:24.020\n Yeah, it's kind of true where that it's like,\n\n53:24.020 --> 53:27.300\n okay, I'm pushing through this, I'm making progress here.\n\n53:27.300 --> 53:30.140\n I know that doesn't work for everyone.\n\n53:30.140 --> 53:32.100\n I know it doesn't work for most people.\n\n53:33.100 --> 53:35.460\n But what I am always trying to do in those cases\n\n53:35.460 --> 53:37.020\n is I don't want to let somebody\n\n53:37.020 --> 53:40.500\n that might be a person like that be told by someone else\n\n53:40.500 --> 53:44.180\n that no, don't even try that out as an option\n\n53:44.180 --> 53:48.740\n where work life balance versus kind of your life's work\n\n53:48.740 --> 53:51.740\n where there's a small subset of the people\n\n53:51.740 --> 53:55.540\n that can be very happy being obsessive about things.\n\n53:55.540 --> 53:58.940\n And, you know, obsession can often get things done\n\n53:58.940 --> 54:03.180\n that just practical, prudent, pedestrian work won't\n\n54:03.180 --> 54:05.900\n or at least won't for a very long time.\n\n54:05.900 --> 54:09.260\n There's legends of your nutritional intake\n\n54:10.220 --> 54:11.500\n in the early days.\n\n54:11.500 --> 54:15.580\n What can you say about sort of as a, you know,\n\n54:15.580 --> 54:17.900\n being a programmer as a kind of athlete?\n\n54:17.900 --> 54:21.420\n So what was the nutrition that fueled?\n\n54:21.420 --> 54:25.780\n I have never been that great on really paying attention\n\n54:25.780 --> 54:29.380\n to it where I'm good enough that I don't eat a lot.\n\n54:29.380 --> 54:31.620\n You know, I've never been like a big heavy guy,\n\n54:31.620 --> 54:34.260\n but it was interesting where one of the things\n\n54:34.260 --> 54:36.660\n that I can remember being an unhappy teenager,\n\n54:36.660 --> 54:38.540\n not having enough money and like,\n\n54:38.540 --> 54:40.060\n one of the things that bothered me\n\n54:40.060 --> 54:41.140\n about not having enough money\n\n54:41.140 --> 54:43.380\n is I couldn't buy pizza whenever I wanted to.\n\n54:43.380 --> 54:46.500\n So I got rich and then I bought a whole lot of pizza.\n\n54:46.500 --> 54:50.100\n So that was defining, like, that's what being rich felt like.\n\n54:50.100 --> 54:52.420\n A lot of the little things, like I could buy all the pizza\n\n54:52.420 --> 54:55.740\n and comic books and video games that I wanted to.\n\n54:55.740 --> 54:58.820\n And it really didn't take that much,\n\n54:58.820 --> 55:00.940\n but the pizza was one of those things\n\n55:00.940 --> 55:03.420\n that it's absolutely true that for a long time\n\n55:03.420 --> 55:06.460\n at id Software, I had a pizza delivered every single day.\n\n55:06.460 --> 55:09.020\n You know, the delivery guy knew me by name\n\n55:09.020 --> 55:11.620\n and I didn't find out until years later\n\n55:11.620 --> 55:13.860\n that apparently I was such a good customer\n\n55:13.860 --> 55:15.780\n that they just never raised the price on me.\n\n55:15.780 --> 55:18.820\n And I was using this six year old price for the pizzas\n\n55:18.820 --> 55:21.500\n that they were still kind of sending my way every day.\n\n55:21.500 --> 55:25.940\n So you were doing eating once a day or were you?\n\n55:25.940 --> 55:26.820\n It would be spread out.\n\n55:26.820 --> 55:28.100\n You know, you have a few pieces of pizza,\n\n55:28.100 --> 55:29.300\n you have some more later on\n\n55:29.300 --> 55:31.820\n and I'd maybe have something at home.\n\n55:31.820 --> 55:34.580\n It was one of the nice things that Facebook Meta\n\n55:34.580 --> 55:36.820\n is they feed you quite well.\n\n55:36.820 --> 55:39.460\n You get a different, I guess now it's DoorDash\n\n55:39.460 --> 55:40.580\n sorts of things delivered,\n\n55:40.580 --> 55:42.580\n but they take care of making sure\n\n55:42.580 --> 55:44.340\n that everybody does get well fed.\n\n55:44.340 --> 55:47.460\n And I probably had better food those six years\n\n55:47.460 --> 55:49.540\n that I was working in the Meta office there\n\n55:49.540 --> 55:51.620\n than I used to before.\n\n55:51.620 --> 55:53.860\n But it's worked out okay for me.\n\n55:53.860 --> 55:55.220\n My health has always been good.\n\n55:55.220 --> 55:57.700\n I get a pretty good amount of exercise\n\n55:57.700 --> 55:59.940\n and I don't eat to excess\n\n55:59.940 --> 56:02.660\n and I avoid a lot of other kind of not so good\n\n56:02.660 --> 56:03.660\n for you things.\n\n56:03.660 --> 56:05.620\n So I'm still doing quite well at my age.\n\n56:05.620 --> 56:10.140\n Did you have a kind of, I don't know,\n\n56:10.140 --> 56:13.620\n spiritual experience with food or coffee\n\n56:13.620 --> 56:15.060\n or any of that kind of stuff?\n\n56:15.060 --> 56:17.500\n I mean, you know, the programming experience,\n\n56:17.500 --> 56:21.300\n you know, with music or like I listen to brown noise\n\n56:21.300 --> 56:24.300\n on a program or like creating an environment\n\n56:24.300 --> 56:26.100\n and the things you take into your body,\n\n56:26.100 --> 56:27.940\n just everything you construct\n\n56:27.940 --> 56:29.580\n can become a kind of ritual\n\n56:29.580 --> 56:32.180\n that empowers the whole process, the programming.\n\n56:32.180 --> 56:34.620\n Did you have that relationship with pizza or?\n\n56:34.620 --> 56:35.940\n It would really be with Diet Coke.\n\n56:35.940 --> 56:38.060\n I mean, there still is that sense of, you know,\n\n56:38.060 --> 56:40.500\n drop the can down, crack open the can of Diet Coke.\n\n56:40.500 --> 56:41.860\n All right, now I mean business.\n\n56:41.860 --> 56:44.020\n We're getting to work here.\n\n56:44.020 --> 56:45.100\n Still to this day?\n\n56:45.100 --> 56:45.940\n Yeah.\n\n56:45.940 --> 56:46.860\n Is Diet Coke still a part of it?\n\n56:46.860 --> 56:49.500\n Yeah, probably eight or nine a day.\n\n56:49.500 --> 56:50.340\n Nice.\n\n56:50.340 --> 56:52.060\n Okay, what about your setup?\n\n56:52.060 --> 56:53.980\n How many screens?\n\n56:53.980 --> 56:55.060\n What kind of keyboard?\n\n56:55.060 --> 56:56.100\n Is there something interesting?\n\n56:56.100 --> 57:01.100\n What kind of IDE, Emacs Vim or something modern?\n\n57:02.020 --> 57:04.100\n Linux, what operating system laptop\n\n57:04.100 --> 57:06.980\n or any interesting thing that brings you joy?\n\n57:06.980 --> 57:09.140\n So I kind of migrated cultures\n\n57:09.140 --> 57:11.420\n where early on through all of game dev,\n\n57:11.420 --> 57:13.180\n there was sort of one culture there,\n\n57:13.180 --> 57:14.580\n which was really quite distinct\n\n57:14.580 --> 57:17.220\n from the more the Silicon Valley venture,\n\n57:17.220 --> 57:19.180\n you know, culture for things.\n\n57:19.180 --> 57:20.140\n They're different groups\n\n57:20.140 --> 57:21.860\n and they have pretty different mores\n\n57:21.860 --> 57:24.540\n and the way they think about things where,\n\n57:24.540 --> 57:26.540\n and I still do think a lot of the big companies\n\n57:26.540 --> 57:30.500\n can learn things from the hardcore game development\n\n57:30.500 --> 57:32.940\n side of things where it still boggles my mind\n\n57:32.940 --> 57:37.940\n how hostile to debuggers and IDEs that so much of them,\n\n57:39.140 --> 57:41.660\n the kind of big money, get billions of dollars,\n\n57:41.660 --> 57:44.380\n Silicon Valley venture backed funds are.\n\n57:44.380 --> 57:45.220\n Oh, that's interesting.\n\n57:45.220 --> 57:48.100\n Sorry, so you're saying like big companies\n\n57:48.100 --> 57:50.180\n like Google and Meta are hostile to?\n\n57:50.180 --> 57:52.780\n They are not big on debuggers and IDEs.\n\n57:52.780 --> 57:55.740\n Like so much of it is like Emacs, Vim for things.\n\n57:55.740 --> 57:58.820\n And we just assume that debuggers don't work\n\n57:58.820 --> 58:01.060\n most of the time for the systems.\n\n58:01.060 --> 58:03.780\n And a lot of this comes from a sort of Linux bias\n\n58:03.780 --> 58:06.420\n on a lot of things where I did come up\n\n58:06.420 --> 58:09.060\n through the personal computers and then the DOS\n\n58:09.060 --> 58:14.020\n and then Windows and it was Borland tools\n\n58:14.020 --> 58:16.740\n and then Visual Studio and.\n\n58:16.740 --> 58:18.500\n Do you appreciate the buggers?\n\n58:18.500 --> 58:19.340\n Very much so.\n\n58:19.340 --> 58:22.020\n I mean, a debugger is how you get a view into a system\n\n58:22.020 --> 58:23.860\n that's too complicated to understand.\n\n58:23.860 --> 58:25.780\n I mean, anybody that thinks just read the code\n\n58:25.780 --> 58:26.780\n and think about it.\n\n58:26.780 --> 58:28.620\n That's an insane statement in the,\n\n58:28.620 --> 58:31.020\n you can't even read all the code on a big system.\n\n58:31.020 --> 58:34.100\n You have to do experiments on the system\n\n58:34.100 --> 58:36.900\n and doing that by adding log statements,\n\n58:36.900 --> 58:39.060\n recompiling and rerunning it\n\n58:39.060 --> 58:41.140\n is an incredibly inefficient way of doing it.\n\n58:41.140 --> 58:43.500\n I mean, yes, you can always get things done\n\n58:43.500 --> 58:46.380\n even if you're working with stone knives and bear skins.\n\n58:46.380 --> 58:48.780\n That is the mark of a good programmer\n\n58:48.780 --> 58:50.420\n is that given any tools,\n\n58:50.420 --> 58:52.500\n you will figure out a way to get it done,\n\n58:52.500 --> 58:54.820\n but it's amazing what you can do\n\n58:54.820 --> 58:57.140\n with sometimes much, much better tools\n\n58:57.140 --> 58:59.900\n where instead of just going through this iterative\n\n58:59.900 --> 59:02.100\n compile run debug cycle,\n\n59:02.100 --> 59:05.060\n you have the old Lisp direction of like,\n\n59:05.060 --> 59:07.020\n you've got a REPL and you're working interactively\n\n59:07.020 --> 59:08.340\n and doing amazing things there.\n\n59:08.340 --> 59:10.380\n But in many cases, a debugger\n\n59:10.380 --> 59:13.380\n as a very powerful user interface that can stop,\n\n59:13.380 --> 59:15.500\n examine all the different things in your program,\n\n59:15.500 --> 59:16.940\n set all of these different breakpoints.\n\n59:16.940 --> 59:20.180\n And of course you can do that with GDB or whatever there,\n\n59:20.180 --> 59:22.780\n but this is one of the user interface\n\n59:22.780 --> 59:23.980\n fundamental principles\n\n59:23.980 --> 59:26.620\n where when something is complicated to do,\n\n59:26.620 --> 59:28.460\n you won't use it very often.\n\n59:28.460 --> 59:30.620\n There's people that will break out GDB\n\n59:30.620 --> 59:31.940\n when they're at their wits end\n\n59:31.940 --> 59:33.260\n and they just have beat their head\n\n59:33.260 --> 59:35.180\n against a problem for so long.\n\n59:35.180 --> 59:37.860\n But for somebody that kind of grew up in game dev,\n\n59:37.860 --> 59:40.060\n it's like they were running into the debugger anyways\n\n59:40.060 --> 59:42.140\n before they even knew there was a problem.\n\n59:42.140 --> 59:44.820\n And you would just stop and see what was happening.\n\n59:44.820 --> 59:46.340\n And sometimes you could fix things\n\n59:46.340 --> 59:50.580\n even before you did one compile cycle.\n\n59:50.580 --> 59:52.160\n You could be in the debugger and you would say,\n\n59:52.160 --> 59:54.220\n well, I'm just going to change this right here.\n\n59:54.220 --> 59:57.020\n And yep, that did the job and fix it and go on.\n\n59:57.020 --> 59:57.860\n And for people who don't know,\n\n59:57.860 --> 1:00:01.620\n GDB is a sort of popular, I guess, Linux debugger\n\n1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:05.260\n primarily for C++.\n\n1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:06.660\n They handle most of the languages,\n\n1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:10.420\n but it's based on C as the original kind of Unix heritage.\n\n1:00:10.420 --> 1:00:11.740\n And it's kind of like command line.\n\n1:00:11.740 --> 1:00:13.340\n It's not user friendly.\n\n1:00:13.340 --> 1:00:15.500\n It doesn't allow for clean visualizations\n\n1:00:15.500 --> 1:00:17.180\n and you're exactly right.\n\n1:00:17.180 --> 1:00:18.980\n So that you're using this kind of debugger\n\n1:00:18.980 --> 1:00:21.020\n usually when you're at what's end\n\n1:00:21.020 --> 1:00:23.380\n and there's a problem that you can't figure out why\n\n1:00:23.380 --> 1:00:25.980\n by just looking at the codes, you have to find it.\n\n1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:28.580\n That's how I guess normal programmers use it.\n\n1:00:28.580 --> 1:00:30.060\n But you're saying there should be tools\n\n1:00:30.060 --> 1:00:32.620\n that kind of visualize and help you\n\n1:00:32.620 --> 1:00:35.300\n as part of the programming process,\n\n1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:37.460\n just the normal programming process\n\n1:00:37.460 --> 1:00:39.940\n to understand the code deeper.\n\n1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:42.900\n Yeah, when I'm working on like my C, C++ code,\n\n1:00:42.900 --> 1:00:45.540\n I'm always running it from the debugger.\n\n1:00:45.540 --> 1:00:48.420\n Just I type in the code, I run it many times.\n\n1:00:48.420 --> 1:00:50.220\n The first thing I do after writing code\n\n1:00:50.220 --> 1:00:53.020\n is set a break point and step through the function.\n\n1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:54.100\n Now other people will say, it's like,\n\n1:00:54.100 --> 1:00:55.500\n oh, I do that in my head.\n\n1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:57.780\n Well, your head is a faulty interpreter\n\n1:00:57.780 --> 1:00:59.060\n of all those things there.\n\n1:00:59.060 --> 1:01:01.020\n And I've written brand new code.\n\n1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:01.980\n I wanna step in there\n\n1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:03.460\n and I'm gonna single step through that,\n\n1:01:03.460 --> 1:01:04.700\n examine lots of things\n\n1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:08.500\n and see if it's actually doing what I expected it to.\n\n1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:12.180\n It is a kind of companion, the debugger.\n\n1:01:12.180 --> 1:01:14.860\n Like you're now coding in an interactive way\n\n1:01:14.860 --> 1:01:17.700\n with another being.\n\n1:01:17.700 --> 1:01:19.420\n The debugger is a kind of dumb being,\n\n1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:21.340\n but it's a reliable being.\n\n1:01:21.340 --> 1:01:22.500\n That is an interesting question\n\n1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:25.940\n of what role does AI play in that kind of,\n\n1:01:25.940 --> 1:01:29.500\n with codecs and these kind of ability to generate code,\n\n1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:32.060\n that might be, you might start having tools\n\n1:01:32.060 --> 1:01:35.900\n that understand the code in interesting deep ways\n\n1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:37.780\n that can work with you.\n\n1:01:37.780 --> 1:01:39.020\n There's a whole spectrum there\n\n1:01:39.020 --> 1:01:43.100\n from static code analyzers and various kind of dynamic tools\n\n1:01:43.100 --> 1:01:46.660\n there up to AI that can conceivably grok these programs\n\n1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:49.060\n that literally no human can understand.\n\n1:01:49.060 --> 1:01:51.940\n They're too big, too intertwined and too interconnected,\n\n1:01:51.940 --> 1:01:54.940\n but it's not beyond the possibility of understanding.\n\n1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:57.820\n It's just beyond what we can hold in our heads\n\n1:01:57.820 --> 1:02:00.860\n as kind of mutable state while we're working on things.\n\n1:02:00.860 --> 1:02:03.260\n And I'm a big proponent, again,\n\n1:02:03.260 --> 1:02:06.140\n of things like static analyzers and some of that stuff\n\n1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:10.420\n where you'll find some people that don't like being scolded\n\n1:02:10.420 --> 1:02:12.660\n by a program for how they've written something\n\n1:02:12.660 --> 1:02:14.100\n where it's like, oh, I know better.\n\n1:02:14.100 --> 1:02:16.460\n And sometimes you do, but that was something\n\n1:02:16.460 --> 1:02:20.580\n that it was very, very valuable for me\n\n1:02:20.580 --> 1:02:23.220\n when, and not too many people get an opportunity\n\n1:02:23.220 --> 1:02:24.060\n like this to have.\n\n1:02:24.060 --> 1:02:26.060\n This is almost one of those spiritual experiences\n\n1:02:26.060 --> 1:02:28.020\n as a programmer, an awakening to,\n\n1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:30.300\n the id software code bases\n\n1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:32.220\n were a couple of million lines of code.\n\n1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:34.660\n And at one point I had used a few\n\n1:02:34.660 --> 1:02:36.300\n of the different analysis tools,\n\n1:02:36.300 --> 1:02:39.580\n but I made a point to really go through\n\n1:02:39.580 --> 1:02:43.260\n and scrub the code base using every tool that I could find.\n\n1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:45.620\n And it was eyeopening where we had a reputation\n\n1:02:45.620 --> 1:02:48.740\n for having some of the most robust, strongest code,\n\n1:02:48.740 --> 1:02:50.700\n where there were some great things\n\n1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:52.940\n that I remember hearing from Microsoft\n\n1:02:52.940 --> 1:02:54.980\n telling us about crashes on Xbox.\n\n1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:56.780\n And we had this tiny number that they said\n\n1:02:56.780 --> 1:02:59.380\n were probably literally hardware errors.\n\n1:02:59.380 --> 1:03:01.380\n And then you have other significant titles\n\n1:03:01.380 --> 1:03:03.380\n that just have millions of faults\n\n1:03:03.380 --> 1:03:04.900\n that are getting recorded all the time.\n\n1:03:04.900 --> 1:03:07.620\n So I was proud of our code on a lot of levels,\n\n1:03:07.620 --> 1:03:10.700\n but when I took this code analysis squeegee\n\n1:03:10.700 --> 1:03:14.420\n through everything, it was shocking\n\n1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:16.740\n how many errors there were in there.\n\n1:03:16.740 --> 1:03:19.780\n Things that you can say, okay, this was a copy paste,\n\n1:03:19.780 --> 1:03:21.700\n not changing something right here.\n\n1:03:21.700 --> 1:03:25.220\n Lots of things that were, the most common problem\n\n1:03:25.220 --> 1:03:27.780\n was something in a printf format string\n\n1:03:27.780 --> 1:03:30.460\n that was the wrong data type that could cause crashes there.\n\n1:03:30.460 --> 1:03:33.340\n And you really want the warnings for things like that.\n\n1:03:33.340 --> 1:03:36.140\n Then the next most common was missing a check for null\n\n1:03:36.140 --> 1:03:38.420\n that could actually happen, that could blow things up.\n\n1:03:38.420 --> 1:03:41.580\n And those are obviously like top C, C++ things.\n\n1:03:41.580 --> 1:03:43.340\n Everybody has those problems.\n\n1:03:43.340 --> 1:03:46.180\n But the long tail of all of the different little things\n\n1:03:46.180 --> 1:03:49.100\n that could go wrong there, and we had good programmers\n\n1:03:49.100 --> 1:03:51.020\n and my own code, stuff that I'd be looking at,\n\n1:03:51.020 --> 1:03:53.700\n it's like, oh, I wrote that code, that's definitely wrong.\n\n1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:56.100\n We've been using this for a year\n\n1:03:56.100 --> 1:03:59.660\n and it's this submarine, this mine sitting there\n\n1:03:59.660 --> 1:04:01.660\n waiting for us to step on.\n\n1:04:01.660 --> 1:04:03.700\n And it was humbling.\n\n1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:05.980\n It was, and I reached the conclusion\n\n1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:09.380\n that anything that can be syntactically allowed\n\n1:04:09.380 --> 1:04:13.380\n in your language, if it's gonna show up eventually\n\n1:04:13.380 --> 1:04:15.420\n in a large enough code base,\n\n1:04:15.420 --> 1:04:16.900\n you're not gonna, good intentions\n\n1:04:16.900 --> 1:04:18.740\n aren't going to keep it from happening.\n\n1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:21.820\n You need automated tools and guardrails for things.\n\n1:04:21.820 --> 1:04:24.060\n And those start with things like static types\n\n1:04:24.060 --> 1:04:26.980\n and or even type hints in the more dynamic languages.\n\n1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:30.180\n But the people that rebel against that,\n\n1:04:30.180 --> 1:04:33.660\n that basically say that slows me down doing that.\n\n1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:35.260\n There's something to that, I get that.\n\n1:04:35.260 --> 1:04:38.860\n I've written, I've cobbled things together in a notebook.\n\n1:04:38.860 --> 1:04:41.020\n I'm like, wow, this is great that it just happened,\n\n1:04:41.020 --> 1:04:42.500\n but yeah, that's kind of sketchy,\n\n1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:44.020\n but it's working fine, I don't care.\n\n1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:47.140\n It does come back to that value analysis\n\n1:04:47.140 --> 1:04:49.740\n where sometimes it's right to not care.\n\n1:04:49.740 --> 1:04:52.460\n But when you do care, if it's going to be something\n\n1:04:52.460 --> 1:04:53.900\n that's going to live for years\n\n1:04:53.900 --> 1:04:56.300\n and it's gonna have other people working on it,\n\n1:04:56.300 --> 1:04:59.060\n and it's gonna be deployed to millions of people,\n\n1:04:59.060 --> 1:05:01.180\n then you wanna use all of these tools.\n\n1:05:01.180 --> 1:05:02.780\n You wanna be told it's like, no,\n\n1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:04.340\n you've screwed up here, here and here.\n\n1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:08.020\n And that does require kind of an ego check about things\n\n1:05:08.020 --> 1:05:11.180\n where you have to be open to the fact\n\n1:05:11.180 --> 1:05:12.260\n that everything that you're doing\n\n1:05:12.260 --> 1:05:14.020\n is just littered with flaws.\n\n1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:16.380\n It's not that, oh, you occasionally have a bad day.\n\n1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:19.180\n It's just whatever stream of code you output,\n\n1:05:19.180 --> 1:05:21.780\n there is going to be a statistical regularity of things\n\n1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:24.140\n that you just make mistakes on.\n\n1:05:24.140 --> 1:05:27.420\n And I do think there's the whole argument\n\n1:05:27.420 --> 1:05:29.980\n about test driven design and unit testing\n\n1:05:29.980 --> 1:05:33.020\n versus kind of analysis and different things.\n\n1:05:33.020 --> 1:05:36.020\n I am more in favor of the analysis and the stuff\n\n1:05:36.020 --> 1:05:37.660\n that just like you can't run your program\n\n1:05:37.660 --> 1:05:40.220\n until you fix this rather than you can run it\n\n1:05:40.220 --> 1:05:42.980\n and hopefully a unit test will catch it in some way.\n\n1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:46.660\n Yeah, in my private code, I have asserts everywhere.\n\n1:05:46.660 --> 1:05:47.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:48.420 --> 1:05:52.340\n There's something pleasant to me, pleasurable to me\n\n1:05:52.340 --> 1:05:55.300\n about sort of the dictatorial rule of like,\n\n1:05:55.300 --> 1:05:57.340\n this should be true at this point.\n\n1:05:58.340 --> 1:06:03.340\n And too many times I've made mistakes\n\n1:06:03.420 --> 1:06:05.820\n that shouldn't have been made.\n\n1:06:05.820 --> 1:06:08.500\n And I would assume I wouldn't be the kind of person\n\n1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:09.340\n that would make that mistake,\n\n1:06:09.340 --> 1:06:10.580\n but I keep making that mistake.\n\n1:06:10.580 --> 1:06:13.940\n Therefore, an assert really catches me,\n\n1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:15.340\n really helps all the time.\n\n1:06:15.340 --> 1:06:19.020\n So my code, I would say like 10 to 20% of my private code\n\n1:06:19.020 --> 1:06:21.420\n just for personal use is probably asserts.\n\n1:06:21.420 --> 1:06:22.540\n And they're active comments.\n\n1:06:22.540 --> 1:06:24.900\n That's one of those things that in theory,\n\n1:06:24.900 --> 1:06:27.220\n they don't make any difference to the program.\n\n1:06:27.220 --> 1:06:29.540\n And if it was all operating the way you expected\n\n1:06:29.540 --> 1:06:32.740\n it would be, then they will never fire.\n\n1:06:32.740 --> 1:06:34.660\n But even if you have it right\n\n1:06:34.660 --> 1:06:36.820\n and you wrote the code right initially,\n\n1:06:36.820 --> 1:06:38.380\n then circumstances change.\n\n1:06:38.380 --> 1:06:40.860\n The world outside your program changes.\n\n1:06:40.860 --> 1:06:42.900\n And in fact, that's one of the things\n\n1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:45.460\n where I'm kind of fond in a lot of cases\n\n1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:47.580\n of static array size declarations,\n\n1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:49.860\n where I went through this period where it's like,\n\n1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:51.980\n okay, now we have general collection classes.\n\n1:06:51.980 --> 1:06:54.460\n We should just make everything variable\n\n1:06:54.460 --> 1:06:57.540\n because I had this history of in the early days,\n\n1:06:57.540 --> 1:07:00.020\n you get doom, which had some fixed limits on it.\n\n1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:02.580\n Then everybody started making crazier and crazier things.\n\n1:07:02.580 --> 1:07:04.180\n And they kept bumping up the different limits,\n\n1:07:04.180 --> 1:07:06.820\n this many lines, this many sectors.\n\n1:07:06.820 --> 1:07:09.020\n And it seemed like a good idea,\n\n1:07:09.020 --> 1:07:10.900\n well, we should just make this completely generic.\n\n1:07:10.900 --> 1:07:13.780\n It can go kind of go up to whatever.\n\n1:07:13.780 --> 1:07:17.340\n And there's cases where that's the right thing to do,\n\n1:07:17.340 --> 1:07:19.820\n but it also, the other aspect of the world\n\n1:07:19.820 --> 1:07:23.060\n changing around you is it's good to be informed\n\n1:07:23.060 --> 1:07:25.700\n when the world has changed more than you thought it would.\n\n1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:28.420\n And if you've got a continuously growing collection,\n\n1:07:28.420 --> 1:07:29.580\n you're never gonna find out.\n\n1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:32.220\n You might have this quadratic slow down on something\n\n1:07:32.220 --> 1:07:34.460\n where you thought, oh, I'm only ever gonna have\n\n1:07:34.460 --> 1:07:36.900\n a handful of these, but something changes\n\n1:07:36.900 --> 1:07:38.220\n and there's a new design style.\n\n1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:40.780\n And all of a sudden you've got 10,000 of them.\n\n1:07:40.780 --> 1:07:44.900\n So I kind of like in many cases, picking a number,\n\n1:07:44.900 --> 1:07:47.580\n some nice brown power of two number\n\n1:07:47.580 --> 1:07:49.900\n and setting it up in there and having an assert saying,\n\n1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:52.180\n it's like, hey, you hit this limit.\n\n1:07:52.180 --> 1:07:54.340\n You should probably think are the choices\n\n1:07:54.340 --> 1:07:56.940\n that you've made around all of this still relevant\n\n1:07:56.940 --> 1:07:59.260\n if somebody's using 10 times more\n\n1:07:59.260 --> 1:08:00.340\n than you thought they would.\n\n1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:02.620\n Yeah, this code was originally written\n\n1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:04.420\n with this kind of worldview,\n\n1:08:04.420 --> 1:08:06.700\n with this kind of set of constraints.\n\n1:08:06.700 --> 1:08:09.380\n You were thinking of the world in this way.\n\n1:08:09.380 --> 1:08:11.740\n If something breaks, that means you gotta rethink\n\n1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:13.100\n the initial stuff.\n\n1:08:13.100 --> 1:08:16.500\n And it's nice for it to do that.\n\n1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:21.500\n Is there any stuff like a keyboard or monitors?\n\n1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:23.780\n I'm a fairly pedestrian on a lot of that\n\n1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:26.140\n where I did move to triple monitors\n\n1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:27.660\n like in the last several years ago.\n\n1:08:27.660 --> 1:08:30.180\n I had been dual monitor for a very long time.\n\n1:08:30.180 --> 1:08:34.820\n And it was one of those things where probably years later\n\n1:08:34.820 --> 1:08:36.140\n than I should have, I'm just like, well,\n\n1:08:36.140 --> 1:08:38.660\n the video cards now generally have three output ports.\n\n1:08:38.660 --> 1:08:40.420\n I should just put the third monitor up there.\n\n1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:41.900\n That's been a pure win.\n\n1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:44.380\n I've been very happy with that.\n\n1:08:44.380 --> 1:08:47.140\n But no, I don't have fancy keyboard or mouse\n\n1:08:47.140 --> 1:08:48.540\n or anything really going on.\n\n1:08:48.540 --> 1:08:52.540\n The key things is an IDE that has helpful debuggers,\n\n1:08:52.540 --> 1:08:54.100\n has helpful tools.\n\n1:08:54.100 --> 1:08:56.980\n So it's not the Emacs Vim route and then Dicode.\n\n1:08:56.980 --> 1:08:58.780\n Yeah, so I did spend,\n\n1:08:58.780 --> 1:09:01.940\n I spent one of my week long retreats where I'm like,\n\n1:09:01.940 --> 1:09:04.260\n okay, I'm gonna make myself use,\n\n1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:05.540\n it was actually classic VI,\n\n1:09:05.540 --> 1:09:07.380\n which I know people will say you should never have done that.\n\n1:09:07.380 --> 1:09:09.340\n You should have just used Vim directly.\n\n1:09:09.340 --> 1:09:11.340\n But I gave it the good try.\n\n1:09:11.340 --> 1:09:13.980\n It's like, okay, I'm being in kind of classic\n\n1:09:13.980 --> 1:09:15.740\n Unix developer mode here.\n\n1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:18.580\n And I worked for a week on it.\n\n1:09:18.580 --> 1:09:20.580\n I used Anki to like teach myself\n\n1:09:20.580 --> 1:09:22.860\n the different little key combinations\n\n1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:23.980\n for things like that.\n\n1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:26.020\n And in the end, it was just like, all right,\n\n1:09:26.020 --> 1:09:28.940\n this was kind of like my civil war reenactment phase.\n\n1:09:28.940 --> 1:09:30.380\n It's like, I'm going out there doing it\n\n1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:31.980\n like they used to in the old days.\n\n1:09:31.980 --> 1:09:34.060\n And it was kind of fun in that regard.\n\n1:09:34.060 --> 1:09:35.300\n So many people right now.\n\n1:09:35.300 --> 1:09:38.660\n They're screaming as they're listening to this.\n\n1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:41.180\n So again, the out is that this was not modern Vim,\n\n1:09:41.180 --> 1:09:44.620\n but still, yes, I was very happy to get back\n\n1:09:44.620 --> 1:09:46.820\n to my visual studio at the end.\n\n1:09:46.820 --> 1:09:49.540\n Yeah, I'm actually, I struggle with this a lot\n\n1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:52.100\n because I use a Kinesis keyboard\n\n1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:55.180\n and I use Emacs primarily.\n\n1:09:56.020 --> 1:09:59.140\n And I feel like I can, exactly as you said,\n\n1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:00.220\n I can understand the code.\n\n1:10:00.220 --> 1:10:01.300\n I can navigate the code.\n\n1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:03.700\n There's a lot of stuff you could build with an Emacs\n\n1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:04.820\n with using Lisp.\n\n1:10:04.820 --> 1:10:07.300\n You can customize a lot of things for yourself\n\n1:10:07.300 --> 1:10:09.900\n to help you introspect the code,\n\n1:10:09.900 --> 1:10:11.620\n like to help you understand the code\n\n1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:13.060\n and visualize different aspects of the code.\n\n1:10:13.060 --> 1:10:14.500\n You can even run debuggers,\n\n1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:18.940\n but it's work and the world moves past you\n\n1:10:18.940 --> 1:10:21.900\n and the better and better ideas are constantly being built.\n\n1:10:21.900 --> 1:10:25.420\n And that puts a kind of,\n\n1:10:25.420 --> 1:10:27.220\n I need to take the same kind of retreat\n\n1:10:27.220 --> 1:10:28.300\n as you're talking about,\n\n1:10:28.300 --> 1:10:30.860\n but now I'm still fighting the civil war.\n\n1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:33.220\n I need to kind of move into the 21st century.\n\n1:10:33.220 --> 1:10:34.980\n And it does seem like the world is,\n\n1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:37.060\n or a large chunk of the world is moving\n\n1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:38.660\n towards visual studio code,\n\n1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:40.420\n which is kind of interesting to me.\n\n1:10:40.420 --> 1:10:43.260\n Again, it's the JavaScript ecosystem on the one hand\n\n1:10:43.260 --> 1:10:45.380\n and IDs are one of those things\n\n1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:47.860\n that you want to be infinitely fast.\n\n1:10:47.860 --> 1:10:50.940\n You want them to just kind of immediately respond.\n\n1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:52.500\n And like, I mean, heck, I've got,\n\n1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:53.340\n there's someone I know,\n\n1:10:53.340 --> 1:10:55.100\n I'm an old school game dev guy\n\n1:10:55.100 --> 1:10:57.420\n that still uses visual studio six.\n\n1:10:57.420 --> 1:10:59.460\n And on a modern computer,\n\n1:10:59.460 --> 1:11:01.940\n everything is just absolutely instant\n\n1:11:01.940 --> 1:11:02.940\n on something like that,\n\n1:11:02.940 --> 1:11:04.620\n because it was made to work on a computer\n\n1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:07.820\n that's 10,000 or a hundred thousand times slower.\n\n1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:10.540\n So just everything happens immediately.\n\n1:11:10.540 --> 1:11:13.500\n And all the modern systems just feel,\n\n1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:15.300\n they feel so crufty when it's like,\n\n1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:17.260\n oh, why is this refreshing the screen\n\n1:11:17.260 --> 1:11:19.220\n and moving around and updating over here?\n\n1:11:19.220 --> 1:11:20.660\n And something blinks down there\n\n1:11:20.660 --> 1:11:21.820\n and you should update this.\n\n1:11:21.820 --> 1:11:25.660\n And there are things that we've lost\n\n1:11:25.660 --> 1:11:27.380\n with that incredible flexibility,\n\n1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:31.060\n but lots of people get tons of value from it.\n\n1:11:31.060 --> 1:11:33.540\n And I am super happy that that seems to be winning\n\n1:11:33.540 --> 1:11:36.140\n over even a lot of the old Vim and Emacs people\n\n1:11:36.140 --> 1:11:37.140\n that they're kind of like,\n\n1:11:37.140 --> 1:11:40.060\n hey, visual studio codes, maybe not so bad.\n\n1:11:40.060 --> 1:11:43.260\n I am, that may be the final peacekeeping solution\n\n1:11:43.260 --> 1:11:45.620\n where everybody is reasonably happy\n\n1:11:45.620 --> 1:11:47.900\n with something like that.\n\n1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:50.540\n So can you explain what a dot plan file is\n\n1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:53.420\n and what role that played in your life?\n\n1:11:53.420 --> 1:11:55.540\n Does it still continue to play a role?\n\n1:11:55.540 --> 1:11:58.660\n Back in the early, early days of id Software,\n\n1:11:58.660 --> 1:12:01.180\n one of our big things that was unique with what we did\n\n1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:04.020\n is I had adopted next stations\n\n1:12:04.020 --> 1:12:05.660\n or kind of next step systems\n\n1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:10.660\n from Steve Jobs's out in the woods away from Apple company.\n\n1:12:11.660 --> 1:12:15.180\n And they were basically, it was kind of interesting\n\n1:12:15.180 --> 1:12:17.140\n because I did not really have a background\n\n1:12:17.140 --> 1:12:18.020\n with the Unix system.\n\n1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:21.820\n So many of the people they get immersed in that in college\n\n1:12:21.820 --> 1:12:26.820\n and that sets a lot of cultural expectations for them.\n\n1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:29.300\n And I didn't have any of that,\n\n1:12:29.300 --> 1:12:31.940\n but I knew that my background was,\n\n1:12:31.940 --> 1:12:34.420\n I was a huge Apple II fan boy.\n\n1:12:34.420 --> 1:12:36.420\n I was always a little suspicious of the Mac.\n\n1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:41.380\n I was not really what kind of I wanted to go with.\n\n1:12:41.380 --> 1:12:44.540\n But when Steve Jobs left Apple and started Next,\n\n1:12:44.540 --> 1:12:46.940\n this computer did just seem like one of those amazing things\n\n1:12:46.940 --> 1:12:50.460\n from the future where it had all of this cool stuff in it.\n\n1:12:50.460 --> 1:12:53.340\n And we were still back in those days working on DOS,\n\n1:12:53.340 --> 1:12:54.220\n everything blew up.\n\n1:12:54.220 --> 1:12:55.540\n You had reset buttons\n\n1:12:55.540 --> 1:12:56.980\n because your computer would just freeze.\n\n1:12:56.980 --> 1:12:58.420\n If you're doing development work,\n\n1:12:58.420 --> 1:12:59.940\n literally dozens of times a day,\n\n1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:02.420\n your computer was just rebooting constantly.\n\n1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:06.420\n And so this idea of, yes, any of the Unix workstations\n\n1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:08.620\n would have given a stable development platform\n\n1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:11.420\n where you don't crash and reboot all the time.\n\n1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:15.540\n But Next also had this really amazing graphical interface\n\n1:13:15.540 --> 1:13:17.420\n and it was great for building tools.\n\n1:13:17.420 --> 1:13:22.420\n And it used Objective C as kind of an interesting dead end\n\n1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:23.340\n for things like that.\n\n1:13:23.340 --> 1:13:26.140\n So Next was Unix based, it said Objective C.\n\n1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:27.780\n So it has a lot of the elements.\n\n1:13:27.780 --> 1:13:28.700\n That became Mac.\n\n1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:31.420\n I mean, the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple by Next\n\n1:13:31.420 --> 1:13:32.780\n where that took over\n\n1:13:32.780 --> 1:13:35.300\n and became what the modern Mac system is.\n\n1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:37.300\n And to find some of the developer,\n\n1:13:38.300 --> 1:13:41.540\n like the tools and the whole community.\n\n1:13:41.540 --> 1:13:42.380\n Yeah, you've still got,\n\n1:13:42.380 --> 1:13:43.820\n if you're programming on Apple stuff now,\n\n1:13:43.820 --> 1:13:45.620\n there's still all these NS somethings,\n\n1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:47.660\n which was originally Next step objects\n\n1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:49.420\n of different kinds of things.\n\n1:13:49.420 --> 1:13:52.900\n But one of the aspects of those Unix systems\n\n1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:56.220\n was they had this notion of a.plan file\n\n1:13:56.220 --> 1:14:00.220\n where a.file is an invisible file.\n\n1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:02.060\n Usually in your home directory or something.\n\n1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:03.700\n And there was a trivial server running\n\n1:14:03.700 --> 1:14:05.900\n on most Unix systems at the time\n\n1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:09.620\n that when somebody ran a trivial little command\n\n1:14:09.620 --> 1:14:11.980\n called finger, you could do finger\n\n1:14:11.980 --> 1:14:13.500\n and then somebody's address,\n\n1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.140\n it could be anywhere on the internet\n\n1:14:15.140 --> 1:14:16.780\n if you were connected correctly.\n\n1:14:16.780 --> 1:14:20.740\n Then all that server would do was read the.plan file\n\n1:14:20.740 --> 1:14:22.460\n in that user's home directory\n\n1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:24.460\n and then just spit it out to you.\n\n1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:27.140\n And originally the idea was that could be\n\n1:14:27.140 --> 1:14:30.060\n whether you're on vacation, what your current project was.\n\n1:14:30.060 --> 1:14:32.420\n It's supposed to be like the plan of what you're doing.\n\n1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:35.700\n And people would use it for various purposes,\n\n1:14:35.700 --> 1:14:39.220\n but all it did was dump that file over\n\n1:14:39.220 --> 1:14:42.660\n to the terminal of whoever issued the finger command.\n\n1:14:42.660 --> 1:14:46.820\n And at one point I started just keeping a list\n\n1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:48.860\n of what I was doing in there,\n\n1:14:48.860 --> 1:14:51.060\n which would be what I was working on in the day.\n\n1:14:51.060 --> 1:14:53.620\n And I would have this little syntax.\n\n1:14:53.620 --> 1:14:55.740\n I kind of got to myself about,\n\n1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:57.140\n here's something that I'm working on.\n\n1:14:57.140 --> 1:14:58.700\n I put a star when I finish it.\n\n1:14:58.700 --> 1:15:01.380\n I could have a few other little bits of punctuation.\n\n1:15:01.380 --> 1:15:02.900\n And at the time it was,\n\n1:15:02.900 --> 1:15:05.540\n it started off as being just like my to do list.\n\n1:15:05.540 --> 1:15:08.620\n And it would be these trivial, obscure little things\n\n1:15:08.620 --> 1:15:12.740\n like I fixed something with collision detection code,\n\n1:15:12.740 --> 1:15:14.900\n made Fireball do something different\n\n1:15:14.900 --> 1:15:16.700\n and just little one liners that people\n\n1:15:16.700 --> 1:15:20.060\n that were following the games could kind of decipher.\n\n1:15:20.060 --> 1:15:24.220\n But I did wind up starting to write much more in depth things.\n\n1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:28.460\n I would have little notes of thoughts and insights\n\n1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:30.420\n and then I would eventually start having little essays.\n\n1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.020\n I would sometimes dump into the dot plan files\n\n1:15:33.020 --> 1:15:36.180\n interspersed with the work logs of things that I was doing.\n\n1:15:36.180 --> 1:15:39.620\n So in some ways it was like a super early proto blog\n\n1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:42.620\n where I was just kind of dumping out what I was working on.\n\n1:15:42.620 --> 1:15:45.460\n But it was interesting enough that there were a lot\n\n1:15:45.460 --> 1:15:48.740\n of people that were interested in this.\n\n1:15:48.740 --> 1:15:51.220\n So most of the people didn't have Unix workstation.\n\n1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:53.300\n So there were the websites back in the day\n\n1:15:53.300 --> 1:15:55.500\n that would follow the Doom and Quake development\n\n1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:58.380\n that would basically make a little service\n\n1:15:58.380 --> 1:15:59.780\n that would go grab all the changes\n\n1:15:59.780 --> 1:16:02.180\n and then people could just get it with a web browser.\n\n1:16:02.180 --> 1:16:04.940\n And there was a period where like all of the little\n\n1:16:04.940 --> 1:16:07.580\n kind of Dallas gaming diaspora of people\n\n1:16:07.580 --> 1:16:09.340\n that were at all in that orbit,\n\n1:16:09.340 --> 1:16:12.220\n there were a couple dozen plan files going on,\n\n1:16:12.220 --> 1:16:15.460\n which was, and this was some years before blogging\n\n1:16:15.460 --> 1:16:17.180\n really became kind of a thing.\n\n1:16:17.180 --> 1:16:20.420\n And it was kind of a premonition\n\n1:16:20.420 --> 1:16:22.220\n of sort of the way things would go.\n\n1:16:22.220 --> 1:16:25.020\n And there was, it's all been collected.\n\n1:16:25.020 --> 1:16:27.060\n It's available online in different places.\n\n1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:29.340\n And it's kind of fun to go back and look through\n\n1:16:29.340 --> 1:16:32.420\n what I was thinking, what I was doing in the different areas.\n\n1:16:32.420 --> 1:16:33.780\n Have you had a chance to look back?\n\n1:16:33.780 --> 1:16:37.340\n Is there some interesting, very low level specific\n\n1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:40.380\n to do items, maybe things you've never completed,\n\n1:16:40.380 --> 1:16:44.180\n all that kind of stuff and high level philosophical essay\n\n1:16:44.180 --> 1:16:46.300\n type of stuff that stands out?\n\n1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:48.340\n Yeah, there's some good stuff on both\n\n1:16:48.340 --> 1:16:51.940\n where a lot of it was low level nitpicky details\n\n1:16:51.940 --> 1:16:55.820\n about game dev and I've learned enough things\n\n1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:58.300\n where there's no project that I worked on\n\n1:16:58.300 --> 1:17:00.620\n that I couldn't go back and do a better job on now.\n\n1:17:00.620 --> 1:17:02.380\n I mean, you just, you learn things,\n\n1:17:02.380 --> 1:17:03.820\n hopefully if you're doing it right,\n\n1:17:03.820 --> 1:17:05.340\n you learn things as you get older\n\n1:17:05.340 --> 1:17:07.300\n and you should be able to do a better job\n\n1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:08.700\n at all of the early things.\n\n1:17:08.700 --> 1:17:12.220\n And there's stuff in Wolfenstein Doomquake that's like,\n\n1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:15.780\n oh, clearly I could go back and do a better job at this,\n\n1:17:15.780 --> 1:17:17.860\n whether it's something in the rendering engine side\n\n1:17:17.860 --> 1:17:20.940\n or how I implemented the monster behaviors\n\n1:17:20.940 --> 1:17:22.780\n or managed resources or anything like that.\n\n1:17:22.780 --> 1:17:24.980\n Do you see the flaws in your thinking now?\n\n1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:26.220\n Like looking back?\n\n1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:27.060\n Yeah, I do.\n\n1:17:27.060 --> 1:17:29.060\n I mean, sometimes I'll get the,\n\n1:17:29.060 --> 1:17:31.500\n I'll look at it and say, yeah, I had a pretty clear view\n\n1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.940\n of I was doing good work there.\n\n1:17:33.940 --> 1:17:35.940\n And I haven't really hit the point\n\n1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:38.740\n where there was another programmer, Graham Devine,\n\n1:17:38.740 --> 1:17:41.740\n who was, he had worked at ID and Seventh Guest\n\n1:17:41.740 --> 1:17:43.700\n and he made some comment one time\n\n1:17:43.700 --> 1:17:45.660\n where he said he looked back at some of his old notes\n\n1:17:45.660 --> 1:17:48.740\n and he was like, wow, I was really smart back then.\n\n1:17:48.740 --> 1:17:52.140\n And I don't hit that so much where,\n\n1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:54.300\n I mean, I look at it and I always know that,\n\n1:17:54.300 --> 1:17:56.500\n yeah, there's all the, you know, with aging,\n\n1:17:56.500 --> 1:18:00.060\n you get certain changes in how you're able to work problems,\n\n1:18:00.060 --> 1:18:02.260\n but all of the problems that I've worked,\n\n1:18:02.260 --> 1:18:06.260\n I'm sure that I could do a better job on all of them.\n\n1:18:06.260 --> 1:18:07.100\n Oh, wow.\n\n1:18:07.100 --> 1:18:08.380\n So you can still step right in.\n\n1:18:08.380 --> 1:18:10.900\n If you could travel back in time and talk to that guy,\n\n1:18:10.900 --> 1:18:12.060\n you would teach him a few things.\n\n1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:13.020\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:15.860\n That's awesome.\n\n1:18:15.860 --> 1:18:18.020\n What about the high level philosophical stuff?\n\n1:18:18.020 --> 1:18:20.620\n Is there some insights that stand out that you remember?\n\n1:18:20.620 --> 1:18:25.340\n There's things that I was understanding about development\n\n1:18:25.340 --> 1:18:28.140\n and, you know, in the industry and so on\n\n1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:31.300\n that were in a more primitive stage\n\n1:18:31.300 --> 1:18:36.300\n where I definitely learned a lot more in the later years\n\n1:18:36.620 --> 1:18:41.300\n about business and organization and team structure.\n\n1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:44.580\n There were, I mean, there were definitely things\n\n1:18:44.580 --> 1:18:46.820\n that I was not the best person\n\n1:18:46.820 --> 1:18:48.900\n or even a very good person about managing,\n\n1:18:48.900 --> 1:18:51.580\n like how a team should operate internally,\n\n1:18:51.580 --> 1:18:53.420\n how people should work together.\n\n1:18:53.420 --> 1:18:57.420\n I was just, you know, just get out of my way\n\n1:18:57.420 --> 1:18:59.500\n and let me work on the code and do this.\n\n1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:02.260\n And more and more, I've learned how,\n\n1:19:03.420 --> 1:19:04.980\n in the larger scheme of things,\n\n1:19:04.980 --> 1:19:07.220\n how sometimes relatively unimportant\n\n1:19:07.220 --> 1:19:08.340\n some of those things are,\n\n1:19:08.340 --> 1:19:11.020\n where it is this user value generation\n\n1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:14.060\n that's the overarching importance for all of that.\n\n1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:17.940\n And I didn't necessarily have my eye on that ball correctly\n\n1:19:17.940 --> 1:19:21.180\n through a lot of my, you know, my earlier years.\n\n1:19:21.180 --> 1:19:23.380\n And there's things that, you know,\n\n1:19:23.380 --> 1:19:25.580\n I could have gotten more out of people\n\n1:19:25.580 --> 1:19:27.460\n handling things in different ways.\n\n1:19:27.460 --> 1:19:29.780\n I am, you know, I could have made, you know,\n\n1:19:29.780 --> 1:19:32.020\n in some ways more successful products\n\n1:19:32.020 --> 1:19:33.820\n by following things in different ways.\n\n1:19:33.820 --> 1:19:35.340\n There's mistakes that we made\n\n1:19:35.340 --> 1:19:37.180\n that we couldn't really have known\n\n1:19:37.180 --> 1:19:38.500\n how things would have worked out,\n\n1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:41.220\n but it was interesting to see in later years companies\n\n1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:42.380\n like Activision showing that,\n\n1:19:42.380 --> 1:19:44.980\n hey, you really can just do the same game,\n\n1:19:44.980 --> 1:19:46.580\n make it better every year.\n\n1:19:46.580 --> 1:19:48.540\n And you can look at that from a negative standpoint\n\n1:19:48.540 --> 1:19:50.500\n and say, it's like, oh, that's just being derivative\n\n1:19:50.500 --> 1:19:51.460\n and all that.\n\n1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:53.580\n But if you step back again and say, it's like, no,\n\n1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.460\n are the people buying it still enjoying it?\n\n1:19:55.460 --> 1:19:56.500\n Are they enjoying it more\n\n1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:59.060\n than what they might have bought otherwise?\n\n1:19:59.060 --> 1:20:00.900\n And you can say, no, that's actually\n\n1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:03.660\n a great value creation engine to do that\n\n1:20:03.660 --> 1:20:05.980\n if you're in a position where you can.\n\n1:20:05.980 --> 1:20:09.260\n I, you know, don't be forced into reinventing everything\n\n1:20:09.260 --> 1:20:11.300\n just because you think that you need to.\n\n1:20:12.740 --> 1:20:15.860\n You know, lots of things about business and team stuff\n\n1:20:15.860 --> 1:20:18.460\n that could be done better, but the technical work,\n\n1:20:18.460 --> 1:20:20.740\n the kind of technical visionary type stuff\n\n1:20:20.740 --> 1:20:23.860\n that I laid out, I still feel pretty good about.\n\n1:20:23.860 --> 1:20:26.540\n There are some classic old ones about my defending\n\n1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:29.220\n of OpenGL versus D3D,\n\n1:20:29.220 --> 1:20:32.180\n which turned out to be one of the more\n\n1:20:32.180 --> 1:20:34.420\n probably important momentous things there\n\n1:20:34.420 --> 1:20:38.820\n where it never, it was always a rear guard action on Windows\n\n1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:42.260\n where Microsoft was just not gonna let that win.\n\n1:20:42.260 --> 1:20:44.300\n But when I look back on it now,\n\n1:20:44.300 --> 1:20:46.660\n that fight to keep OpenGL relevant\n\n1:20:46.660 --> 1:20:48.740\n for a number of years there\n\n1:20:48.740 --> 1:20:52.580\n meant that OpenGL was there when mobile started happening\n\n1:20:52.580 --> 1:20:55.580\n and OpenGL ES was the thing that drove\n\n1:20:55.580 --> 1:20:58.540\n all of the acceleration of the mobile industry.\n\n1:20:58.540 --> 1:21:00.860\n And it's really only in the last few years\n\n1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:02.460\n as Apple's moved to Metal\n\n1:21:02.460 --> 1:21:04.980\n and some of the other companies have moved to Vulkan\n\n1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:06.700\n that that's moved away.\n\n1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:09.420\n But really stepping back and looking at it,\n\n1:21:09.420 --> 1:21:11.900\n it's like, yeah, I sold tens of millions of games\n\n1:21:11.900 --> 1:21:13.580\n for different things.\n\n1:21:13.580 --> 1:21:17.380\n But billions and billions of devices wound up\n\n1:21:17.380 --> 1:21:21.220\n with an appropriate capable graphics API\n\n1:21:21.220 --> 1:21:23.740\n due in no small part to me thinking\n\n1:21:23.740 --> 1:21:25.180\n that that was really important\n\n1:21:25.180 --> 1:21:29.100\n that we not just give up and use Microsoft's\n\n1:21:30.540 --> 1:21:32.900\n at that time really terrible API.\n\n1:21:32.900 --> 1:21:35.820\n The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay terrible.\n\n1:21:35.820 --> 1:21:38.940\n They were terrible at the start, but a few versions on,\n\n1:21:38.940 --> 1:21:40.060\n they were actually quite good.\n\n1:21:40.060 --> 1:21:42.460\n And there was a completely fair argument to be made\n\n1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:45.020\n that by the time DX9 was out,\n\n1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:47.220\n it was probably a better programming environment\n\n1:21:47.220 --> 1:21:51.100\n than OpenGL, but it was still a wonderful good thing\n\n1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:52.540\n that we had an open standard\n\n1:21:52.540 --> 1:21:55.740\n that could show up on Linux and Android and iOS\n\n1:21:55.740 --> 1:21:58.620\n and eventually WebGL still to this day.\n\n1:21:58.620 --> 1:22:02.620\n So that was one, that would be on my greatest hits list\n\n1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:04.460\n of things that I kind of pushed with.\n\n1:22:04.460 --> 1:22:07.700\n The impact it had on billions of devices, yes.\n\n1:22:07.700 --> 1:22:08.940\n So let's talk about it.\n\n1:22:08.940 --> 1:22:12.380\n Can you tell the origin story of id Software?\n\n1:22:12.380 --> 1:22:16.340\n Again, one of the greatest game developer companies ever.\n\n1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:18.900\n It created Wolfenstein 3D games\n\n1:22:18.900 --> 1:22:22.580\n that defined my life also in many ways\n\n1:22:22.580 --> 1:22:24.280\n as a thing that made me realize\n\n1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:26.700\n what computers are capable of in terms of graphics,\n\n1:22:26.700 --> 1:22:30.260\n in terms of performance, it just unlocked something deep\n\n1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:34.220\n in me and understanding what these machines are all about\n\n1:22:34.220 --> 1:22:35.140\n as games can do that.\n\n1:22:35.140 --> 1:22:37.420\n So Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake,\n\n1:22:37.420 --> 1:22:40.700\n and just all the incredible engineering innovation\n\n1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:41.780\n that went into that.\n\n1:22:41.780 --> 1:22:44.300\n So how did it all start?\n\n1:22:44.300 --> 1:22:45.940\n So I'll caveat upfront\n\n1:22:45.940 --> 1:22:49.460\n that I usually don't consider myself the historian\n\n1:22:49.460 --> 1:22:51.480\n of the software side of things.\n\n1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:55.020\n I usually do kind of point people at John Romero\n\n1:22:55.020 --> 1:23:00.020\n for stories about the early days where I've never been,\n\n1:23:00.140 --> 1:23:01.780\n like I've commented that I'm a remarkably\n\n1:23:01.780 --> 1:23:03.980\n unsentimental person in some ways\n\n1:23:03.980 --> 1:23:05.780\n where I don't really spend a lot of time\n\n1:23:05.780 --> 1:23:07.980\n unless I'm explicitly prodded to go back\n\n1:23:07.980 --> 1:23:10.300\n and think about the early days of things.\n\n1:23:10.300 --> 1:23:14.660\n And I didn't necessarily make the effort\n\n1:23:14.660 --> 1:23:17.100\n to archive everything exactly in my brain.\n\n1:23:17.100 --> 1:23:19.460\n And the more that I work on machine learning and AI\n\n1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:20.880\n and the aspects of memory\n\n1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.360\n and how when you go back and polish certain things,\n\n1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:25.920\n it's not necessarily exactly the way it happened.\n\n1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:29.580\n But having said all of that, from my view,\n\n1:23:29.580 --> 1:23:32.680\n the way everything happened that led up to that was\n\n1:23:34.220 --> 1:23:36.140\n after I was an adult\n\n1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:38.140\n and kind of taking a few college classes\n\n1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:40.860\n and deciding to drop out, I was doing,\n\n1:23:40.860 --> 1:23:43.620\n I was hardscrabble contract programming work,\n\n1:23:43.620 --> 1:23:46.220\n really struggling to kind of keep groceries\n\n1:23:46.220 --> 1:23:48.140\n and pay my rent and things.\n\n1:23:48.140 --> 1:23:50.560\n And the company that I was doing the most work for\n\n1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:53.180\n was a company called Softdisk Publishing,\n\n1:23:53.180 --> 1:23:57.100\n which had the sounds bizarre now business model\n\n1:23:57.100 --> 1:23:59.780\n of monthly subscription software.\n\n1:23:59.780 --> 1:24:02.300\n Before there was an internet that people could connect to\n\n1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:05.780\n and get software, you would pay a certain amount\n\n1:24:05.780 --> 1:24:07.540\n and every month they would send you a disc\n\n1:24:07.540 --> 1:24:09.780\n that had some random software on it.\n\n1:24:09.780 --> 1:24:11.460\n And people that were into computers\n\n1:24:11.460 --> 1:24:12.740\n thought this was kind of cool.\n\n1:24:12.740 --> 1:24:14.980\n And they had different ones for the Apple II,\n\n1:24:14.980 --> 1:24:18.900\n the 2GS, the PC, the Mac, the Amiga,\n\n1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:20.060\n lots of different things here.\n\n1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:21.440\n So quirky little business,\n\n1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:24.580\n but I was doing a lot of contract programming for them\n\n1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:26.460\n where I'd write tiny little games\n\n1:24:26.460 --> 1:24:29.980\n and sell them for 300, $500.\n\n1:24:29.980 --> 1:24:32.920\n And one of the things that I was doing again\n\n1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:35.080\n to keep my head above water here was\n\n1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:38.020\n I decided that I could make one program\n\n1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:41.060\n and I could port it to multiple systems.\n\n1:24:41.060 --> 1:24:44.900\n So I would write a game like Dark Designs or Catacombs\n\n1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:47.940\n and I would develop it on the Apple II, the 2GS\n\n1:24:47.940 --> 1:24:51.780\n and the IBM PC, which apparently was the thing\n\n1:24:51.780 --> 1:24:54.300\n that really kind of piqued the attention\n\n1:24:54.300 --> 1:24:56.420\n of the people working down there.\n\n1:24:56.420 --> 1:24:58.500\n Like Jay Wilbur was my primary editor\n\n1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:01.220\n and Tom Hall was a secondary editor.\n\n1:25:01.220 --> 1:25:02.700\n And they kept asking me, it's like,\n\n1:25:02.700 --> 1:25:06.060\n hey, you should come down and work for us here.\n\n1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:08.300\n And I pushed it off a couple of times\n\n1:25:08.300 --> 1:25:10.300\n because I was really enjoying my freedom\n\n1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:11.840\n of kind of being off on my own.\n\n1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:14.700\n Even if I was barely getting by, I loved it.\n\n1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:17.760\n I was doing nothing but programming all day,\n\n1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:20.500\n but I did have enough close scrapes with like,\n\n1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:21.980\n damn, I'm just really out of money\n\n1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:25.020\n that maybe I should get an actual job\n\n1:25:25.020 --> 1:25:27.940\n rather than contracting these kind of one at a time things.\n\n1:25:27.940 --> 1:25:29.400\n And Jay Wilbur was great.\n\n1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:32.020\n He was like FedExing me the checks when I would need them.\n\n1:25:32.020 --> 1:25:35.700\n I had to kind of get over whatever hump I was at.\n\n1:25:35.700 --> 1:25:38.720\n So I took the, I finally took them up on their offer\n\n1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:41.260\n to come down to Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\n1:25:41.260 --> 1:25:43.820\n I was in Kansas city at the time,\n\n1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:47.320\n drove down to through the Ozarks and everything\n\n1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:51.820\n down to Louisiana and saw the soft disk offices,\n\n1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:53.740\n went through, talked to a bunch of people,\n\n1:25:53.740 --> 1:25:56.520\n met the people I had been working with remotely\n\n1:25:56.520 --> 1:25:57.800\n at that time.\n\n1:25:57.800 --> 1:25:59.180\n But the most important thing for me\n\n1:25:59.180 --> 1:26:01.740\n was I met two programmers there,\n\n1:26:01.740 --> 1:26:04.780\n John Romero and Lane Roth that for the first time ever,\n\n1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:08.500\n I had met programmers that knew more cool stuff than I did\n\n1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:11.020\n where the world was just different back then.\n\n1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:12.420\n I was in Kansas city.\n\n1:26:12.420 --> 1:26:14.620\n It was one of those smartest kid in the school\n\n1:26:14.620 --> 1:26:15.980\n does all the computer stuff.\n\n1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:18.140\n The teachers don't have anything to teach him.\n\n1:26:18.140 --> 1:26:20.320\n But all I had to learn from was these few books\n\n1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:21.260\n at the library.\n\n1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:23.100\n It was not much at all.\n\n1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:25.220\n And there were some aspects of programming\n\n1:26:25.220 --> 1:26:27.220\n that were kind of black magic to me.\n\n1:26:27.220 --> 1:26:30.180\n Like, it's like, oh, he knows how to format a track on,\n\n1:26:30.180 --> 1:26:34.300\n I am on a low level drive programming interface.\n\n1:26:34.300 --> 1:26:37.380\n And this was, I was still not at all sure\n\n1:26:37.380 --> 1:26:38.560\n I was gonna take the job,\n\n1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:40.820\n but I met these awesome programmers\n\n1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:42.300\n that were doing cool stuff.\n\n1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:44.380\n And Romero had worked at Origin Systems\n\n1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:49.020\n and he had done like, so many different games ahead of time\n\n1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:50.740\n that I did kind of quickly decide,\n\n1:26:50.740 --> 1:26:53.220\n it's like, yeah, I'll go take the job down there.\n\n1:26:53.220 --> 1:26:57.100\n And I settled down there, moved in\n\n1:26:57.100 --> 1:26:59.780\n and started working on more little projects.\n\n1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:03.060\n And the first kind of big change that happened down there\n\n1:27:03.060 --> 1:27:05.620\n was the company wanted to make a gaming focused,\n\n1:27:05.620 --> 1:27:08.260\n a PC gaming focused subscription.\n\n1:27:08.260 --> 1:27:09.180\n Just like all their other,\n\n1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:11.880\n it was the same formula that they used for everything.\n\n1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:14.760\n Pay a monthly fee and you'll get a disc\n\n1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:16.940\n with one or two games just every month\n\n1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:19.860\n and no choice in what you get, but we think it'll be fun.\n\n1:27:19.860 --> 1:27:21.980\n And that was the model they were comfortable with\n\n1:27:21.980 --> 1:27:22.820\n and they said, all right,\n\n1:27:22.820 --> 1:27:25.140\n we're gonna start this gamers edge department.\n\n1:27:25.140 --> 1:27:27.860\n And all of us that were interested in that,\n\n1:27:27.860 --> 1:27:31.420\n like me, Romero, Tom Hall was kind of helping us\n\n1:27:31.420 --> 1:27:34.100\n from his side of things, Jay would peek in\n\n1:27:34.100 --> 1:27:37.160\n and we had a few other programmers working with us\n\n1:27:37.160 --> 1:27:38.220\n at the time.\n\n1:27:38.220 --> 1:27:41.260\n And we were going to just start making games,\n\n1:27:41.260 --> 1:27:43.400\n just the same model.\n\n1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:45.860\n And we dived in and it was fantastic.\n\n1:27:45.860 --> 1:27:47.560\n Do you have to make new games?\n\n1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:48.400\n Every month.\n\n1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:49.220\n Every month.\n\n1:27:49.220 --> 1:27:50.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:50.060 --> 1:27:52.740\n And this, in retrospect, looking back at it,\n\n1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:55.380\n that sense that I had done all this contract programming\n\n1:27:55.380 --> 1:27:58.060\n and John Romero had done like far more of this\n\n1:27:58.060 --> 1:28:00.900\n where he had done one of his teaching himself efforts\n\n1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:03.420\n was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet.\n\n1:28:03.420 --> 1:28:04.260\n It's that sense of like,\n\n1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:06.260\n I'm just gonna go make 26 different games,\n\n1:28:06.260 --> 1:28:07.700\n give them a different theme.\n\n1:28:07.700 --> 1:28:10.300\n And you learn so much when you go through\n\n1:28:10.300 --> 1:28:12.180\n and you crank these things out\n\n1:28:12.180 --> 1:28:14.580\n like on a biweekly, monthly basis,\n\n1:28:14.580 --> 1:28:16.060\n something like that. From start to finish.\n\n1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:17.860\n It's not like just an idea.\n\n1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:21.760\n It's not just from the very beginning to the very end.\n\n1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:22.860\n It's done.\n\n1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:24.300\n It has to be done.\n\n1:28:24.300 --> 1:28:25.300\n There's no delaying.\n\n1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:26.140\n It's done.\n\n1:28:26.140 --> 1:28:26.980\n And you've got deadlines.\n\n1:28:26.980 --> 1:28:31.980\n And that kind of rapid iteration pressure cooker environment\n\n1:28:32.100 --> 1:28:35.300\n was super important for all of us developing the skills\n\n1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:38.500\n that brought us to where we eventually went to.\n\n1:28:38.500 --> 1:28:39.980\n I mean, people would say like,\n\n1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:41.180\n like in the history of the Beatles,\n\n1:28:41.180 --> 1:28:43.100\n like it wasn't them being the Beatles.\n\n1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:46.060\n It was them playing all of these other early works\n\n1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:48.340\n that that opportunity to craft all of their skills\n\n1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:49.820\n before they were famous,\n\n1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:53.000\n that was very critical to their later successes.\n\n1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:54.940\n And I think there's a lot of that here\n\n1:28:54.940 --> 1:28:58.740\n where we did these games that nobody remembers,\n\n1:28:58.740 --> 1:29:00.940\n lots of little things that contributed\n\n1:29:00.940 --> 1:29:02.900\n to building up the skillset for the things\n\n1:29:02.900 --> 1:29:05.340\n that eventually did make us famous.\n\n1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:08.340\n Yeah, Dostoevsky wrote The Gambler.\n\n1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:12.420\n I had to write it in a month, just to make money.\n\n1:29:12.420 --> 1:29:14.620\n And nobody remembers that probably\n\n1:29:14.620 --> 1:29:15.820\n because he had to figure out,\n\n1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:17.140\n because it's literally,\n\n1:29:17.980 --> 1:29:21.140\n he didn't have enough time to write it fast enough.\n\n1:29:21.140 --> 1:29:23.060\n So he had to come up with hacks.\n\n1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:23.900\n Literally,\n\n1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:25.220\n it again comes down to that point\n\n1:29:25.220 --> 1:29:28.260\n where pressure and limitation of resources\n\n1:29:28.260 --> 1:29:30.340\n is surprisingly important.\n\n1:29:30.340 --> 1:29:32.580\n And it's counterintuitive in a lot of ways\n\n1:29:32.580 --> 1:29:34.340\n where you just think that if you've got all the time\n\n1:29:34.340 --> 1:29:36.580\n in the world and you've got all the resources in the world,\n\n1:29:36.580 --> 1:29:38.420\n of course, you're gonna get something better.\n\n1:29:38.420 --> 1:29:40.380\n But sometimes it really does work out\n\n1:29:40.380 --> 1:29:44.420\n that the innovations, mother necessity,\n\n1:29:44.420 --> 1:29:46.440\n where you can, or resource constraints,\n\n1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:49.300\n and you have to do things when you don't have a choice.\n\n1:29:49.300 --> 1:29:50.740\n It's surprising what you can do.\n\n1:29:50.740 --> 1:29:52.740\n Is there any good games written in that time?\n\n1:29:52.740 --> 1:29:53.580\n Would you say?\n\n1:29:53.580 --> 1:29:55.700\n Some of them are still fun to go back and play\n\n1:29:55.700 --> 1:29:57.220\n where you get the,\n\n1:29:58.220 --> 1:29:59.900\n they were all about kind of,\n\n1:29:59.900 --> 1:30:01.820\n the more modern term is game feel,\n\n1:30:01.820 --> 1:30:04.140\n about how just the exact feel that things,\n\n1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:06.260\n it's not the grand strategy of the design,\n\n1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:08.860\n but how running and jumping and shooting\n\n1:30:08.860 --> 1:30:11.780\n and those things I feel in the moment.\n\n1:30:11.780 --> 1:30:13.420\n And some of those are still,\n\n1:30:13.420 --> 1:30:15.180\n if you sat down on them, you kind of go,\n\n1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:16.060\n it's a little bit different.\n\n1:30:16.060 --> 1:30:17.780\n It doesn't have the same movement feel,\n\n1:30:17.780 --> 1:30:20.780\n but you move over and you're like, bang, jump, bang.\n\n1:30:20.780 --> 1:30:23.180\n It's like, hey, that's kind of cool still.\n\n1:30:23.180 --> 1:30:25.980\n So you can get lost in the rhythm of the game.\n\n1:30:25.980 --> 1:30:27.820\n Is that what you mean by feel?\n\n1:30:27.820 --> 1:30:31.380\n Just like there's something about it that pulls you in?\n\n1:30:31.380 --> 1:30:33.820\n Nowadays, again, people talk about compulsion loops\n\n1:30:33.820 --> 1:30:37.220\n and things where it's that sense of exactly\n\n1:30:37.220 --> 1:30:38.900\n what you're doing, what your fingers are doing\n\n1:30:38.900 --> 1:30:41.140\n on the keyboard, what your eyes are seeing,\n\n1:30:41.140 --> 1:30:43.300\n and there are gonna be these sequences of things.\n\n1:30:43.300 --> 1:30:44.860\n Grab the loot, shoot the monster,\n\n1:30:44.860 --> 1:30:47.020\n jump over the obstacle, get to the end of the level.\n\n1:30:47.020 --> 1:30:50.620\n These are eternal aspects of game design in a lot of ways,\n\n1:30:50.620 --> 1:30:53.300\n but there are better and worse ways to do all of them.\n\n1:30:53.300 --> 1:30:55.380\n And we did so many of these games\n\n1:30:55.380 --> 1:30:58.820\n that we got a lot of practice with it.\n\n1:30:58.820 --> 1:31:01.060\n So one of the kind of weird things\n\n1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:02.460\n that was happening at this time\n\n1:31:02.460 --> 1:31:06.740\n is John Romero was getting some strange fan mail.\n\n1:31:06.740 --> 1:31:09.140\n And back in the days, this was before email.\n\n1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:12.420\n So we literally got letters sometimes and telling him,\n\n1:31:12.420 --> 1:31:14.340\n it's like, oh, I wanna talk to you about your games.\n\n1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:17.100\n I wanna reach out, different things.\n\n1:31:17.100 --> 1:31:19.660\n And eventually it turned out\n\n1:31:19.660 --> 1:31:21.980\n that these were all coming from Scott Miller\n\n1:31:21.980 --> 1:31:23.980\n at Apogee Software.\n\n1:31:23.980 --> 1:31:26.300\n And he was reaching out through,\n\n1:31:26.300 --> 1:31:28.300\n he didn't think he could contact John directly,\n\n1:31:28.300 --> 1:31:29.540\n that he would get intercepted.\n\n1:31:29.540 --> 1:31:31.700\n So he was trying to get him to contact him\n\n1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:34.260\n through like back channel fan mail,\n\n1:31:34.260 --> 1:31:35.460\n because he basically was saying,\n\n1:31:35.460 --> 1:31:38.540\n hey, I'm making all this money on shareware games.\n\n1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:40.860\n I want you to make shareware games,\n\n1:31:40.860 --> 1:31:42.580\n because he had seen some of the games\n\n1:31:42.580 --> 1:31:44.500\n that Romero had done.\n\n1:31:44.500 --> 1:31:47.780\n And we looked at Scott Miller's games\n\n1:31:47.780 --> 1:31:50.500\n and we didn't think they were very good.\n\n1:31:50.500 --> 1:31:53.100\n We're like, that can't be making the kind of money\n\n1:31:53.100 --> 1:31:56.220\n that he's saying he's making 10 grand or something\n\n1:31:56.220 --> 1:31:57.140\n off of this game.\n\n1:31:57.140 --> 1:31:59.380\n And we really thought that he was full of shit,\n\n1:31:59.380 --> 1:32:03.140\n that it was a lie trying to get him into this.\n\n1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:07.100\n But so that was kind of going on at one level.\n\n1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:10.180\n And it was funny the moment when Romero realized\n\n1:32:10.180 --> 1:32:12.500\n that he had some of these letters pinned up on his wall,\n\n1:32:12.500 --> 1:32:13.540\n like all of his fans.\n\n1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:15.380\n And then we noticed that they all had the same return\n\n1:32:15.380 --> 1:32:17.340\n address with different names on them,\n\n1:32:17.340 --> 1:32:19.860\n which was a little bit of a two edged sword there.\n\n1:32:19.860 --> 1:32:23.420\n Trying to figure out the puzzle laid out before him.\n\n1:32:23.420 --> 1:32:26.660\n Yeah, what happened after I kind of coincident with that\n\n1:32:26.660 --> 1:32:29.860\n was I was working on a lot of the new technologies\n\n1:32:29.860 --> 1:32:33.860\n where I was now full on the IBM PC for the first time,\n\n1:32:33.860 --> 1:32:37.220\n where I was really a long hold out on Apple II forever.\n\n1:32:37.220 --> 1:32:38.980\n And I loved my Apple II.\n\n1:32:38.980 --> 1:32:40.660\n It was the computer I always wished I had\n\n1:32:40.660 --> 1:32:41.700\n when I was growing up.\n\n1:32:41.700 --> 1:32:43.140\n And when I finally did have one,\n\n1:32:43.140 --> 1:32:46.180\n I was kind of clinging on to that well past it\n\n1:32:46.180 --> 1:32:47.540\n sort of good use by day.\n\n1:32:47.540 --> 1:32:50.740\n Is it the best computer ever made you would you say?\n\n1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:53.180\n I wouldn't make judgments like that about it,\n\n1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:54.740\n but it was positioned in such a way,\n\n1:32:54.740 --> 1:32:57.660\n especially in the school systems that it impacted\n\n1:32:57.660 --> 1:33:00.420\n a whole lot of American programmers at least,\n\n1:33:00.420 --> 1:33:02.940\n where there was programs that the Apple IIs\n\n1:33:02.940 --> 1:33:05.980\n got into the schools and they had enough capability\n\n1:33:05.980 --> 1:33:08.780\n that lots of interesting things happened with them.\n\n1:33:08.780 --> 1:33:09.820\n In Europe, it was different.\n\n1:33:09.820 --> 1:33:13.980\n You had your Amigas and Ataris and Acorns in the UK\n\n1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:16.100\n and things that had different things.\n\n1:33:16.100 --> 1:33:17.060\n But in the United States,\n\n1:33:17.060 --> 1:33:19.740\n it was probably the Apple II made the most impact\n\n1:33:19.740 --> 1:33:23.300\n for a lot of programmers of my generation.\n\n1:33:23.300 --> 1:33:26.100\n But so I was really digging into the IBM\n\n1:33:26.100 --> 1:33:29.340\n and this was even more so with the total focus\n\n1:33:29.340 --> 1:33:30.780\n because I had moved to another city\n\n1:33:30.780 --> 1:33:33.860\n where I didn't know anybody that I wasn't working with.\n\n1:33:33.860 --> 1:33:36.380\n I had a little apartment and then at Softdisk,\n\n1:33:36.380 --> 1:33:38.780\n again, the things that drew me to it,\n\n1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:42.260\n I had a couple of programmers that knew more than I did\n\n1:33:42.260 --> 1:33:43.580\n and they had a library.\n\n1:33:43.580 --> 1:33:46.060\n They had a set of books and a set of magazines.\n\n1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:47.700\n They had a couple of years of magazines,\n\n1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:50.700\n the old Dr. Dobbs journal and all of these magazines\n\n1:33:50.700 --> 1:33:53.140\n that had information about things.\n\n1:33:53.140 --> 1:33:56.500\n And so I was just in total immersion mode.\n\n1:33:56.500 --> 1:33:59.460\n It was eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming,\n\n1:33:59.460 --> 1:34:03.300\n particularly the IBM for everything that I was doing.\n\n1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:05.060\n And I was digging into a lot of these\n\n1:34:05.060 --> 1:34:06.580\n low level hardware details\n\n1:34:06.580 --> 1:34:08.900\n that people weren't usually paying attention to,\n\n1:34:08.900 --> 1:34:13.900\n the way the IBM EGA cards worked, which was fun for me.\n\n1:34:13.900 --> 1:34:16.460\n I hadn't had experience with things at that level.\n\n1:34:16.460 --> 1:34:19.580\n And back then you could get hardware documentation\n\n1:34:19.580 --> 1:34:21.020\n just down at the register levels.\n\n1:34:21.020 --> 1:34:23.460\n This is where the CRTC register is.\n\n1:34:23.460 --> 1:34:25.620\n This is how the color registers work\n\n1:34:25.620 --> 1:34:27.420\n and how the different things are applied.\n\n1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:29.820\n And they were designed for a certain reason.\n\n1:34:29.820 --> 1:34:31.420\n They were designed for an application.\n\n1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:33.780\n They had an intended use in mind,\n\n1:34:33.780 --> 1:34:36.820\n but I was starting to look at other ways\n\n1:34:36.820 --> 1:34:38.260\n that they could perhaps be exploited\n\n1:34:38.260 --> 1:34:40.260\n that they weren't initially intended for.\n\n1:34:40.260 --> 1:34:44.020\n Could you comment on like, first of all, what operating system was there?\n\n1:34:44.020 --> 1:34:45.820\n What instruction set was it?\n\n1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:48.580\n Like, what are we talking about?\n\n1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:50.500\n So this was DOS and x86.\n\n1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:52.740\n So 16 bit, 8086.\n\n1:34:52.740 --> 1:34:55.460\n The 286s were there and 386s existed.\n\n1:34:55.460 --> 1:34:56.860\n They were rare.\n\n1:34:56.860 --> 1:34:59.380\n We had a couple for our development systems,\n\n1:34:59.380 --> 1:35:02.740\n but we were still targeting the more broad.\n\n1:35:02.740 --> 1:35:04.940\n It was all DOS 16 bit.\n\n1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:07.540\n None of this was kind of DOS extenders and things.\n\n1:35:07.540 --> 1:35:09.420\n How different is it from the systems of today?\n\n1:35:09.420 --> 1:35:12.340\n Is it kind of a precursor that's similar?\n\n1:35:12.340 --> 1:35:13.020\n Very little.\n\n1:35:13.020 --> 1:35:17.700\n If you open up command.exe or com on Windows,\n\n1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:19.700\n you see some of the remnants of all of that,\n\n1:35:19.700 --> 1:35:21.060\n but it was a different world.\n\n1:35:21.060 --> 1:35:25.620\n It was the 640K is enough world, and nothing was protected.\n\n1:35:25.620 --> 1:35:26.740\n It crashed all the time.\n\n1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:29.940\n You had TSRs or terminate and stay resident hacks\n\n1:35:29.940 --> 1:35:33.180\n on top of things that would cause configuration problems.\n\n1:35:33.180 --> 1:35:37.500\n All the hardware was manually configured in your auto exec.\n\n1:35:37.500 --> 1:35:39.260\n So it was a very different world.\n\n1:35:39.260 --> 1:35:41.300\n But the code is still the same, similar.\n\n1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:42.540\n You could still write it.\n\n1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:44.660\n My earliest code there was written in Pascal.\n\n1:35:44.660 --> 1:35:47.700\n That was what I had learned at an earlier point.\n\n1:35:47.700 --> 1:35:51.180\n So between BASIC and C++, there was Pascal.\n\n1:35:51.180 --> 1:35:55.460\n So when BASIC assembly language, some of my intermediate stuff\n\n1:35:55.460 --> 1:35:57.020\n was, well, you had to for performance.\n\n1:35:57.020 --> 1:35:58.380\n BASIC was just too slow.\n\n1:35:58.380 --> 1:36:00.460\n So most of the work that I was doing\n\n1:36:00.460 --> 1:36:02.820\n as a contract programmer in my teenage years\n\n1:36:02.820 --> 1:36:05.100\n was assembly language.\n\n1:36:05.100 --> 1:36:07.180\n Wait, you wrote games in assembly?\n\n1:36:07.180 --> 1:36:10.660\n Yeah, complete games in assembly language.\n\n1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:12.700\n And it's thousands and thousands of lines\n\n1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:16.580\n of three letter acronyms for the instructions.\n\n1:36:16.580 --> 1:36:21.060\n You don't earn the once again greatest programmer ever label\n\n1:36:21.060 --> 1:36:23.140\n without being able to write a game in assembly.\n\n1:36:23.140 --> 1:36:23.620\n OK.\n\n1:36:23.620 --> 1:36:24.980\n That's good.\n\n1:36:24.980 --> 1:36:27.380\n Everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language.\n\n1:36:27.380 --> 1:36:28.140\n It was kind of a.\n\n1:36:28.140 --> 1:36:28.900\n Everybody serious.\n\n1:36:28.900 --> 1:36:29.700\n See what he said?\n\n1:36:29.700 --> 1:36:31.180\n Everybody serious.\n\n1:36:31.180 --> 1:36:33.940\n It was an outlier to use Pascal a little bit,\n\n1:36:33.940 --> 1:36:36.420\n where there was one famous program called wizardry.\n\n1:36:36.420 --> 1:36:39.460\n It was one of the great early role playing games\n\n1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:40.900\n that was written in Pascal.\n\n1:36:40.900 --> 1:36:43.540\n But it was almost nothing used Pascal there.\n\n1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:45.140\n But I did learn Pascal.\n\n1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:47.220\n And I remember doing all of my.\n\n1:36:47.220 --> 1:36:49.260\n To this day, I sketch in data structures.\n\n1:36:49.260 --> 1:36:52.660\n When I'm thinking about something, I'll open up a file\n\n1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:55.340\n and I'll start writing struct definitions for how\n\n1:36:55.340 --> 1:36:56.900\n data is going to be laid out.\n\n1:36:56.900 --> 1:36:58.940\n And Pascal was kind of formative to that\n\n1:36:58.940 --> 1:37:02.260\n because I remember designing my RPGs in Pascal record\n\n1:37:02.260 --> 1:37:04.100\n structures and things like that.\n\n1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:07.940\n And so I had gotten the Pascal compiler for the Apple 2GS\n\n1:37:07.940 --> 1:37:08.740\n that I could work on.\n\n1:37:08.740 --> 1:37:12.420\n And the first IBM game that I developed, I did in Pascal.\n\n1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:14.860\n And that's actually kind of an interesting story,\n\n1:37:14.860 --> 1:37:17.900\n again, talking about the constraints and resources\n\n1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:19.980\n where I had an Apple 2GS.\n\n1:37:19.980 --> 1:37:21.500\n I didn't have an IBM PC.\n\n1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:24.540\n I wanted to port my applications to IBM\n\n1:37:24.540 --> 1:37:27.060\n because I thought I could make more money on it.\n\n1:37:27.060 --> 1:37:31.540\n So what I wound up doing is I rented a PC for a week\n\n1:37:31.540 --> 1:37:33.940\n and bought a copy of Turbo Pascal.\n\n1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:36.820\n And so I had a hard one week and this was cutting into\n\n1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:38.900\n what minimal profit margin I had there.\n\n1:37:38.900 --> 1:37:40.340\n But I had this computer for a week.\n\n1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:43.300\n I had to get my program ported before I had to return\n\n1:37:43.300 --> 1:37:46.780\n the PC and that was kind of what the first thing\n\n1:37:46.780 --> 1:37:49.220\n that I had done on the IBM PC and what led me\n\n1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:51.620\n to taking the job at Softdisk.\n\n1:37:51.620 --> 1:37:55.260\n And Turbo Pascal, how's that different from regular Pascal?\n\n1:37:55.260 --> 1:37:57.380\n Is it a different compiler or something like that?\n\n1:37:57.380 --> 1:38:00.060\n It was a product of Borland, which before Microsoft\n\n1:38:00.060 --> 1:38:02.980\n kind of killed them, they were the hot stuff\n\n1:38:02.980 --> 1:38:04.180\n developer tools company.\n\n1:38:04.180 --> 1:38:06.540\n You had Borland, Turbo Pascal and Turbo C\n\n1:38:06.540 --> 1:38:09.540\n and Prologue, I mean, all the different things.\n\n1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:12.780\n But what they did was they took a supremely pragmatic\n\n1:38:12.780 --> 1:38:14.500\n approach of making something useful.\n\n1:38:14.500 --> 1:38:17.220\n It was one of these great examples where Pascal\n\n1:38:17.220 --> 1:38:20.340\n was an academic language and you had things like\n\n1:38:20.340 --> 1:38:23.780\n the UCSDP system that Wizardry was actually written in\n\n1:38:23.780 --> 1:38:27.020\n that they did manage to make a game with that,\n\n1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:30.860\n but it was not a super practical system.\n\n1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:33.540\n While Turbo Pascal was, it was called Turbo\n\n1:38:33.540 --> 1:38:35.540\n because it was blazingly fast to compile.\n\n1:38:35.540 --> 1:38:39.460\n I mean, really ridiculously 10 to 20 times faster\n\n1:38:39.460 --> 1:38:41.620\n than most other compilers at the time.\n\n1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:44.360\n But it also had very pragmatic access to look,\n\n1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:46.820\n you can just poke at the hardware in these different ways\n\n1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:49.260\n and we have libraries that let you do things.\n\n1:38:49.260 --> 1:38:51.660\n And it was a pretty good, it was a perfectly good way\n\n1:38:51.660 --> 1:38:53.700\n to write games and this is one of those things\n\n1:38:53.700 --> 1:38:56.500\n where people have talked about different paths\n\n1:38:56.500 --> 1:38:58.660\n that computer development could have taken\n\n1:38:58.660 --> 1:39:01.940\n where C took over the world for reasons\n\n1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:05.100\n that came out of Unix and eventually Linux.\n\n1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:07.260\n And that was not a foregone conclusion at all.\n\n1:39:07.260 --> 1:39:10.860\n And people can make real reasoned rational arguments\n\n1:39:10.860 --> 1:39:12.440\n that the world might've been better\n\n1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:14.420\n if it had gone a Pascal route.\n\n1:39:14.420 --> 1:39:17.660\n I'm somewhat agnostic on that where I do know\n\n1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:21.260\n from experience, it was perfectly good enough to do that.\n\n1:39:21.260 --> 1:39:23.180\n And it had some fundamental improvements\n\n1:39:23.180 --> 1:39:26.100\n like it had range checked arrays as an option there,\n\n1:39:26.100 --> 1:39:29.620\n which could avoid many of C's real hazards\n\n1:39:29.620 --> 1:39:31.560\n that happened in a security space.\n\n1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.740\n But C1, they were basically offering it\n\n1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:35.580\n about the same level of abstraction.\n\n1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:38.660\n It was a systems programming language, but.\n\n1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:41.380\n But you said Pascal had a more emphasis on data structures.\n\n1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:44.980\n I actually, in the tree of languages,\n\n1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:48.100\n did Pascal come before C?\n\n1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:49.660\n They were pretty contemporaneous.\n\n1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:53.380\n So Pascal's lineage went to Modula 2 and eventually Oberon,\n\n1:39:53.380 --> 1:39:58.740\n which was another Nicholas word, kind of experimental language.\n\n1:39:58.740 --> 1:40:01.420\n But they were all good enough at that level.\n\n1:40:01.420 --> 1:40:04.340\n Now, some of the classic academic oriented Pascals\n\n1:40:04.340 --> 1:40:06.380\n were just missing fundamental things like, oh, you can't\n\n1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:08.620\n access this core system thing because we're just\n\n1:40:08.620 --> 1:40:10.340\n using it to teach students.\n\n1:40:10.340 --> 1:40:14.060\n But Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes to it\n\n1:40:14.060 --> 1:40:17.140\n really did make it a completely capable language.\n\n1:40:17.140 --> 1:40:19.620\n And it had some reasons why you could implement it\n\n1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:22.580\n as a single pass compiler so it could be way, way faster,\n\n1:40:22.580 --> 1:40:24.460\n although less scope for optimizations\n\n1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:26.260\n if you do it that way.\n\n1:40:26.260 --> 1:40:28.300\n And it did have some range checking options.\n\n1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:30.740\n It had a little bit better typing capability.\n\n1:40:30.740 --> 1:40:33.140\n You'd have properly typed enums, sorts of things,\n\n1:40:33.140 --> 1:40:35.220\n and other stuff that C lacked.\n\n1:40:35.220 --> 1:40:37.900\n But C was also clearly good enough.\n\n1:40:37.900 --> 1:40:39.660\n And it wound up with a huge inertia\n\n1:40:39.660 --> 1:40:42.740\n from the Unix ecosystem and everything that came with that.\n\n1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:43.980\n Garbage collection?\n\n1:40:43.980 --> 1:40:45.380\n No, it was not garbage collected.\n\n1:40:45.380 --> 1:40:46.500\n It's just the same kind of thing as C.\n\n1:40:46.500 --> 1:40:47.100\n Same manual.\n\n1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:49.100\n So you could still have your use after freeze\n\n1:40:49.100 --> 1:40:50.320\n and all those other problems.\n\n1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:53.740\n But just getting rid of array overruns,\n\n1:40:53.740 --> 1:40:56.080\n at least if you were compiled with that debugging option,\n\n1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:58.260\n certainly would have avoided a lot of problems\n\n1:40:58.260 --> 1:40:59.740\n and could have a lot of benefits.\n\n1:40:59.740 --> 1:41:01.400\n But so anyways, that was the next thing.\n\n1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:04.780\n I had to learn C because C was where it seemed like most\n\n1:41:04.780 --> 1:41:07.020\n of the things were going.\n\n1:41:07.020 --> 1:41:09.580\n So I abandoned Pascal and I started working in C.\n\n1:41:09.580 --> 1:41:11.980\n I started hacking on these hardware things dealing\n\n1:41:11.980 --> 1:41:16.000\n with the graphics controllers and the EGA systems.\n\n1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.060\n And what we most wanted to do, so at that time\n\n1:41:19.060 --> 1:41:22.260\n we were sitting in our darkened office\n\n1:41:22.260 --> 1:41:24.740\n playing all the different console video games.\n\n1:41:24.740 --> 1:41:27.620\n And we were figuring out what games\n\n1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:30.500\n do we want to make for our Gamer's Edge product there.\n\n1:41:30.500 --> 1:41:34.180\n And so we had one of the first Super Nintendos sitting there.\n\n1:41:34.180 --> 1:41:37.500\n And we had an older Nintendo looking at all those games.\n\n1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:40.020\n And the core thing that those consoles did that you just\n\n1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:42.700\n didn't get on the PC games was this ability\n\n1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:45.180\n to have a massive scrolling world where\n\n1:41:45.180 --> 1:41:47.980\n most of the games that you would make on the PC\n\n1:41:47.980 --> 1:41:51.500\n and earlier personal computers would be a static screen.\n\n1:41:51.500 --> 1:41:55.020\n You move little things around on it and you interact like that.\n\n1:41:55.020 --> 1:41:58.260\n Maybe you go to additional screens as you move.\n\n1:41:58.260 --> 1:42:01.900\n But arcade games and consoles had this wonderful ability\n\n1:42:01.900 --> 1:42:04.420\n to just have a big world that you're slowly\n\n1:42:04.420 --> 1:42:06.100\n moving your window through.\n\n1:42:06.100 --> 1:42:08.460\n And that was for those types of games,\n\n1:42:08.460 --> 1:42:10.820\n that kind of action exploration adventure games,\n\n1:42:10.820 --> 1:42:13.060\n that was a super, super important thing.\n\n1:42:13.060 --> 1:42:16.260\n And PC games just didn't do that.\n\n1:42:16.260 --> 1:42:18.740\n And what I had come across was a couple\n\n1:42:18.740 --> 1:42:22.300\n of different techniques for implementing that on the PC.\n\n1:42:22.300 --> 1:42:25.180\n And they're not hard, complicated things.\n\n1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:28.140\n When I explain them now, they're pretty straightforward.\n\n1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:29.260\n But just nobody was doing it.\n\n1:42:29.260 --> 1:42:31.900\n You sound like Einstein describing his five papers\n\n1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:33.100\n is pretty straightforward.\n\n1:42:33.100 --> 1:42:34.020\n I understand.\n\n1:42:34.020 --> 1:42:35.980\n But they're nevertheless revolutionary.\n\n1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:38.420\n So side scrolling is a game changer.\n\n1:42:38.420 --> 1:42:40.420\n Yeah, and scrolling is a genius invention.\n\n1:42:40.420 --> 1:42:41.620\n It's either vertical.\n\n1:42:41.620 --> 1:42:43.660\n And some of the consoles had different limitations\n\n1:42:43.660 --> 1:42:45.420\n about you could do one but not the other.\n\n1:42:45.420 --> 1:42:48.420\n And there were similar things going on as advancements,\n\n1:42:48.420 --> 1:42:51.740\n even in the console space, where you'd have the original Mario\n\n1:42:51.740 --> 1:42:54.580\n game was just horizontal scrolling.\n\n1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:57.300\n And then later, Mario games added vertical aspects to it\n\n1:42:57.300 --> 1:42:59.180\n and different things that you were\n\n1:42:59.180 --> 1:43:02.980\n doing to explore, kind of expand the capabilities there.\n\n1:43:02.980 --> 1:43:05.500\n And so much of the early game design for decades\n\n1:43:05.500 --> 1:43:08.580\n was removing limitations, letting you do things\n\n1:43:08.580 --> 1:43:10.100\n that you envisioned as a designer,\n\n1:43:10.100 --> 1:43:11.940\n you wanted the player to experience,\n\n1:43:11.940 --> 1:43:14.340\n but the hardware just couldn't really\n\n1:43:14.340 --> 1:43:16.580\n or you didn't know how to make it happen.\n\n1:43:16.580 --> 1:43:17.700\n It felt impossible.\n\n1:43:17.700 --> 1:43:21.940\n You can imagine that you want to create like this big world\n\n1:43:21.940 --> 1:43:23.940\n through which you can side scroll,\n\n1:43:23.940 --> 1:43:26.660\n like through which you can walk.\n\n1:43:26.660 --> 1:43:28.380\n And then you ask yourself a question,\n\n1:43:28.380 --> 1:43:31.900\n how do I actually build that in a way that's\n\n1:43:31.900 --> 1:43:35.900\n like the latency is low enough, the hardware can actually\n\n1:43:35.900 --> 1:43:38.780\n deliver that in such a way that it's a compelling experience.\n\n1:43:38.780 --> 1:43:40.380\n Yeah, and we knew what we wanted to do\n\n1:43:40.380 --> 1:43:42.700\n because we were playing all of these console games,\n\n1:43:42.700 --> 1:43:45.140\n playing all these Nintendo games and arcade games.\n\n1:43:45.140 --> 1:43:47.260\n Clearly, there was a whole world of awesome things\n\n1:43:47.260 --> 1:43:51.380\n there that we just couldn't do on the PC, at least initially.\n\n1:43:51.380 --> 1:43:52.860\n Because every programmer can tell,\n\n1:43:52.860 --> 1:43:54.220\n it's like if you want to scroll, you can just\n\n1:43:54.220 --> 1:43:55.460\n redraw the whole screen.\n\n1:43:55.460 --> 1:43:56.860\n But then it turns out, well, you're\n\n1:43:56.860 --> 1:43:58.820\n going five frames per second.\n\n1:43:58.820 --> 1:44:01.020\n That's not an interactive fun experience.\n\n1:44:01.020 --> 1:44:04.700\n You want to be going 30 or 60 frames per second or something.\n\n1:44:04.700 --> 1:44:06.860\n And it just didn't feel like that was possible.\n\n1:44:06.860 --> 1:44:10.500\n It felt like the PCs had to get five times faster for you\n\n1:44:10.500 --> 1:44:12.700\n to make a playable game there.\n\n1:44:12.700 --> 1:44:16.140\n And interestingly, I wound up with two completely different\n\n1:44:16.140 --> 1:44:18.820\n solutions for the scrolling problem.\n\n1:44:18.820 --> 1:44:23.060\n And this is a theme that runs through everything, where\n\n1:44:23.060 --> 1:44:25.740\n all of these big technical advancements, it turns out\n\n1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:28.460\n there's always a couple different ways of doing them.\n\n1:44:28.460 --> 1:44:31.740\n And it's not like you found the one true way of doing it.\n\n1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:35.220\n And we'll see this as we go into 3D games and things later.\n\n1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:38.540\n But so the scrolling, the first set of scrolling tricks\n\n1:44:38.540 --> 1:44:43.620\n that I got was the hardware had this ability to,\n\n1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:47.660\n you could shift inside the window of memory.\n\n1:44:47.660 --> 1:44:51.980\n So the EGA cards at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory.\n\n1:44:51.980 --> 1:44:55.340\n And it was awkwardly set up in this planar format,\n\n1:44:55.340 --> 1:45:00.780\n where instead of having 256 or 24 million colors,\n\n1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:03.420\n you had 16 colors, which is four bits.\n\n1:45:03.420 --> 1:45:06.300\n So you had four bit planes, 64k a piece.\n\n1:45:06.300 --> 1:45:08.420\n Of course, 64k is a nice round number\n\n1:45:08.420 --> 1:45:10.380\n for 16 bit addressing.\n\n1:45:10.380 --> 1:45:13.860\n So your graphics card had a 16 bit window\n\n1:45:13.860 --> 1:45:15.220\n that you could look at.\n\n1:45:15.220 --> 1:45:17.900\n And you could tell it to start the video scan out\n\n1:45:17.900 --> 1:45:19.340\n anywhere inside there.\n\n1:45:19.340 --> 1:45:21.140\n So there were a couple games that\n\n1:45:21.140 --> 1:45:23.900\n had taken this approach of you could make a 2 by 2 screen\n\n1:45:23.900 --> 1:45:25.740\n or a 1 by 4 screen.\n\n1:45:25.740 --> 1:45:28.140\n And you could do scrolling really easily like that.\n\n1:45:28.140 --> 1:45:30.940\n You could just lay it all out and just pan around there.\n\n1:45:30.940 --> 1:45:32.620\n But you just couldn't make it any bigger\n\n1:45:32.620 --> 1:45:35.540\n because that's all the memory that was there.\n\n1:45:35.540 --> 1:45:37.700\n The first insight to the scrolling that I had\n\n1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:42.300\n was, well, if we make a screen that's just one tile larger,\n\n1:45:42.300 --> 1:45:45.820\n and we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels by 16 pixels,\n\n1:45:45.820 --> 1:45:48.940\n the little classic Mario block that you run into,\n\n1:45:48.940 --> 1:45:50.820\n lots of art gets drawn that way.\n\n1:45:50.820 --> 1:45:52.860\n And your screen is a certain number of tiles.\n\n1:45:52.860 --> 1:45:56.620\n But if you had one little buffer region outside of that,\n\n1:45:56.620 --> 1:45:59.980\n you could easily pan around inside that 16 pixel region.\n\n1:45:59.980 --> 1:46:01.740\n That could be perfectly smooth.\n\n1:46:01.740 --> 1:46:04.020\n But then what happens if you get to the edge\n\n1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:05.940\n and you want to keep going?\n\n1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:08.380\n The first way we did scrolling was\n\n1:46:08.380 --> 1:46:11.460\n what I called adaptive tile refresh, which was really\n\n1:46:11.460 --> 1:46:13.620\n just a matter of you get to the edge\n\n1:46:13.620 --> 1:46:16.140\n and then you go back to the original point\n\n1:46:16.140 --> 1:46:19.380\n and then only change the tiles that have actually\n\n1:46:19.380 --> 1:46:21.580\n that are different between where it was.\n\n1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:23.380\n In most of the games at the time,\n\n1:46:23.380 --> 1:46:26.900\n if you think about your classic Super Mario Brothers game,\n\n1:46:26.900 --> 1:46:30.940\n you've got big fields of blue sky, long rows\n\n1:46:30.940 --> 1:46:33.300\n of the same brick texture.\n\n1:46:33.300 --> 1:46:34.980\n And there's a lot of commonality.\n\n1:46:34.980 --> 1:46:36.580\n It's like a data compression thing.\n\n1:46:36.580 --> 1:46:38.980\n If you take the screen and you set it down\n\n1:46:38.980 --> 1:46:42.460\n on top of each other, in general, only about 10%\n\n1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:45.180\n of the tiles were actually different there.\n\n1:46:45.180 --> 1:46:47.940\n So this was a way to go ahead and say,\n\n1:46:47.940 --> 1:46:49.980\n well, I'm going to move it back, and then I'm only\n\n1:46:49.980 --> 1:46:54.100\n going to change those 10%, 20%, whatever percent tiles there.\n\n1:46:54.100 --> 1:46:57.540\n And that meant that it was essentially five times faster\n\n1:46:57.540 --> 1:46:59.860\n than if you were redrawing all of the tiles.\n\n1:46:59.860 --> 1:47:01.300\n And that worked well enough for us\n\n1:47:01.300 --> 1:47:04.860\n to do a bunch of these games for Gamer's Edge.\n\n1:47:04.860 --> 1:47:07.100\n We had a lot of these scrolling games like Slurred Axe\n\n1:47:07.100 --> 1:47:09.260\n and Shadow Knights and things like that\n\n1:47:09.260 --> 1:47:11.380\n that we were cranking out at this high rate that\n\n1:47:11.380 --> 1:47:13.540\n had this scrolling effect on it.\n\n1:47:13.540 --> 1:47:14.620\n And it worked well enough.\n\n1:47:14.620 --> 1:47:16.100\n There were design challenges there\n\n1:47:16.100 --> 1:47:18.180\n where if you made the worst case,\n\n1:47:18.180 --> 1:47:20.460\n if you made a checkerboard over the entire screen,\n\n1:47:20.460 --> 1:47:23.220\n you scroll over one and every single tile changes\n\n1:47:23.220 --> 1:47:25.100\n and your frame rate's now five frames per second\n\n1:47:25.100 --> 1:47:27.100\n because it had to redraw everything.\n\n1:47:27.100 --> 1:47:28.700\n So the designers had a little bit\n\n1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:29.900\n that they had to worry about.\n\n1:47:29.900 --> 1:47:32.020\n They had to make these relatively plain looking\n\n1:47:32.020 --> 1:47:34.900\n levels, but it was still pretty magical.\n\n1:47:34.900 --> 1:47:37.460\n It was something that we hadn't seen before.\n\n1:47:37.460 --> 1:47:41.340\n And the first thing that we wound up doing with that\n\n1:47:41.340 --> 1:47:43.660\n was I had just gotten this working,\n\n1:47:43.660 --> 1:47:46.300\n and Tom Hall was sitting there with me,\n\n1:47:46.300 --> 1:47:49.820\n and we were looking over at our Super Nintendo on the side\n\n1:47:49.820 --> 1:47:52.500\n there with Super Mario 3 running.\n\n1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:56.260\n And we had the technology, we had the tools set up there,\n\n1:47:56.260 --> 1:47:57.780\n and we stayed up all night.\n\n1:47:57.780 --> 1:47:59.820\n And we basically cloned the first level\n\n1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:01.260\n of Super Mario Brothers.\n\n1:48:01.260 --> 1:48:02.460\n Performance wise as well?\n\n1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:02.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:02.940 --> 1:48:05.860\n And we had our little character running and jumping in there.\n\n1:48:05.860 --> 1:48:09.100\n It was close to pixel accurate as far\n\n1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:11.300\n as all the backgrounds and everything,\n\n1:48:11.300 --> 1:48:13.540\n but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled together\n\n1:48:13.540 --> 1:48:15.380\n from previous games that I had written.\n\n1:48:15.380 --> 1:48:18.060\n I just really kitbashed the whole thing together\n\n1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:19.420\n to make this demo.\n\n1:48:19.420 --> 1:48:21.500\n And that was one of the rare cases\n\n1:48:21.500 --> 1:48:24.260\n when I said I don't usually do these all night programming\n\n1:48:24.260 --> 1:48:24.860\n things.\n\n1:48:24.860 --> 1:48:26.860\n There's probably only two memorable ones\n\n1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:28.580\n that I can think about.\n\n1:48:28.580 --> 1:48:31.940\n One was the all nighter to go ahead and get\n\n1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:34.460\n our Dangerous Dave and copyright infringement\n\n1:48:34.460 --> 1:48:35.420\n is how we titled it.\n\n1:48:35.420 --> 1:48:38.100\n Because we had a game called Dangerous Dave running around\n\n1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:41.140\n with a shotgun shooting things, and we were just\n\n1:48:41.140 --> 1:48:44.140\n taking our most beloved game at the time there, the Super Mario\n\n1:48:44.140 --> 1:48:47.980\n 3, and sticking Dave inside that with this new scrolling\n\n1:48:47.980 --> 1:48:53.500\n technology that was going perfectly smooth for them\n\n1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:54.660\n as it ran.\n\n1:48:54.660 --> 1:48:58.340\n And Tom and I just blearily the next morning left,\n\n1:48:58.340 --> 1:49:02.940\n and we left a disk on the desk for John Romero and Jay\n\n1:49:02.940 --> 1:49:05.220\n Wilbur to see and just said, run this.\n\n1:49:05.220 --> 1:49:08.380\n And we eventually made it back in later in the day,\n\n1:49:08.380 --> 1:49:13.260\n and it was like they grabbed us and pulled us into the room.\n\n1:49:13.260 --> 1:49:15.660\n And that was the point where they were like,\n\n1:49:15.660 --> 1:49:17.740\n we got to do something with this.\n\n1:49:17.740 --> 1:49:19.300\n We're going to make a company.\n\n1:49:19.300 --> 1:49:21.580\n We're going to go make our own games, where\n\n1:49:21.580 --> 1:49:24.980\n this was something that we were able to just kind of hit them\n\n1:49:24.980 --> 1:49:27.060\n with a hammer of an experience like, wow, this\n\n1:49:27.060 --> 1:49:30.140\n is just like so much cooler than what we thought\n\n1:49:30.140 --> 1:49:31.660\n was possible there.\n\n1:49:31.660 --> 1:49:33.860\n And initially, we tried to get Nintendo\n\n1:49:33.860 --> 1:49:36.900\n to let us make Super Mario 3 on the PC.\n\n1:49:36.900 --> 1:49:38.420\n That's really what we wanted to do.\n\n1:49:38.420 --> 1:49:40.220\n We were like, hey, we can finish this.\n\n1:49:40.220 --> 1:49:41.380\n It's line of sight.\n\n1:49:41.380 --> 1:49:42.620\n This will be great.\n\n1:49:42.620 --> 1:49:45.180\n And we sent something to Nintendo,\n\n1:49:45.180 --> 1:49:48.180\n and we heard that it did get looked at in Japan,\n\n1:49:48.180 --> 1:49:50.380\n and they just weren't interested in that.\n\n1:49:50.380 --> 1:49:52.180\n But that's another one of those life could\n\n1:49:52.180 --> 1:49:53.740\n have gone a very different way, where\n\n1:49:53.740 --> 1:49:57.700\n we could have been like Nintendo's house PC team\n\n1:49:57.700 --> 1:49:58.540\n at that point.\n\n1:49:58.540 --> 1:50:06.660\n And define the direction of Wolfenstein and Doom and Quake\n\n1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:08.940\n could have been a Nintendo creation.\n\n1:50:08.940 --> 1:50:09.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:09.460 --> 1:50:11.620\n So at the same time that we were just\n\n1:50:11.620 --> 1:50:14.660\n doing our first scrolling demos, we\n\n1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:17.660\n reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee and said,\n\n1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:20.180\n it's like, hey, we do want to make some games.\n\n1:50:20.180 --> 1:50:22.660\n These things that you think you want, those are nothing.\n\n1:50:22.660 --> 1:50:24.540\n What do you see what we can actually do now?\n\n1:50:24.540 --> 1:50:26.180\n This is going to be amazing.\n\n1:50:26.180 --> 1:50:29.340\n And he just popped right up and sent a check to us,\n\n1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:31.420\n where at that point, we still thought\n\n1:50:31.420 --> 1:50:34.500\n he might be a fraud, that he was just lying about all of this.\n\n1:50:34.500 --> 1:50:36.900\n But he was totally correct on how much money\n\n1:50:36.900 --> 1:50:39.340\n he was making with his shareware titles.\n\n1:50:39.340 --> 1:50:43.180\n And this was his real brainstorm about this,\n\n1:50:43.180 --> 1:50:45.980\n where shareware was this idea that software\n\n1:50:45.980 --> 1:50:47.220\n doesn't have a fixed price.\n\n1:50:47.220 --> 1:50:49.860\n If you use it, you send out of the goodness of your heart\n\n1:50:49.860 --> 1:50:51.660\n some money to the creator.\n\n1:50:51.660 --> 1:50:53.300\n And there were a couple of utilities\n\n1:50:53.300 --> 1:50:55.980\n that did make some significant success like that.\n\n1:50:55.980 --> 1:50:58.420\n But for the most part, it didn't really work.\n\n1:50:58.420 --> 1:51:01.580\n Now, there wasn't much software in a pure shareware model\n\n1:51:01.580 --> 1:51:03.860\n that was successful.\n\n1:51:03.860 --> 1:51:07.700\n The Apogee innovation was to take something,\n\n1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:10.180\n call it shareware, split it into three pieces.\n\n1:51:10.180 --> 1:51:12.100\n You always made a trilogy.\n\n1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:14.300\n And you would put the first piece out,\n\n1:51:14.300 --> 1:51:16.180\n but then you buy the whole trilogy\n\n1:51:16.180 --> 1:51:19.420\n for some shareware amount, which in reality,\n\n1:51:19.420 --> 1:51:21.260\n it meant that the first part was a demo,\n\n1:51:21.260 --> 1:51:24.060\n where you kind of like the demo went everywhere for free\n\n1:51:24.060 --> 1:51:26.580\n and you paid money to get the whole set.\n\n1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:28.620\n But it was still play to shareware.\n\n1:51:28.620 --> 1:51:31.060\n And we were happy to have the first one go everywhere.\n\n1:51:31.060 --> 1:51:33.980\n And it wasn't a crippled demo, where the first episode\n\n1:51:33.980 --> 1:51:36.420\n of all these trilogies, it was a real complete game.\n\n1:51:36.420 --> 1:51:39.820\n And probably 20 times as many people played that part of it,\n\n1:51:39.820 --> 1:51:43.500\n thought they had a great game, had fond memories of it,\n\n1:51:43.500 --> 1:51:45.340\n but never paid us a dime.\n\n1:51:45.340 --> 1:51:48.140\n But enough people were happy with that,\n\n1:51:48.140 --> 1:51:50.700\n where it was really quite successful.\n\n1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:53.220\n And these early games that we didn't think very much of\n\n1:51:53.220 --> 1:51:55.780\n compared to commercial quality games,\n\n1:51:55.780 --> 1:51:57.780\n but they were doing really good business,\n\n1:51:57.780 --> 1:51:59.320\n some fairly crude things.\n\n1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:01.340\n And people, it was good business.\n\n1:52:01.340 --> 1:52:02.340\n People enjoyed it.\n\n1:52:02.340 --> 1:52:04.500\n And it wasn't like you were taking a crapshoot\n\n1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:05.540\n on what you were getting.\n\n1:52:05.540 --> 1:52:07.780\n You just played a third of the experience.\n\n1:52:07.780 --> 1:52:10.860\n And you loved it enough to hand write out a check\n\n1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:13.860\n and put it in an envelope and address it and send it out\n\n1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:16.740\n to Apogee to get the rest of them.\n\n1:52:16.740 --> 1:52:20.620\n So it was a really pretty feel good business prospect there,\n\n1:52:20.620 --> 1:52:23.160\n because everybody was happy.\n\n1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:26.060\n They knew what they were getting when they sent it in.\n\n1:52:26.060 --> 1:52:27.180\n They would send in fan mail.\n\n1:52:27.180 --> 1:52:29.520\n If you're going to the trouble of addressing a letter\n\n1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:32.660\n and filling out an envelope, you write something in it.\n\n1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:35.420\n And there were just the literal bags of fan mail\n\n1:52:35.420 --> 1:52:38.940\n for the shareware games, so people loved them.\n\n1:52:38.940 --> 1:52:42.540\n I should mention that for you, the definition of wealth\n\n1:52:42.540 --> 1:52:46.580\n is being able to have pizza whenever you want.\n\n1:52:46.580 --> 1:52:50.780\n For me, there was a dream that I would play shareware games\n\n1:52:50.780 --> 1:52:53.860\n over and over, the part that's free, over and over.\n\n1:52:53.860 --> 1:52:56.500\n And it was very deeply fulfilling experience.\n\n1:52:56.500 --> 1:53:00.340\n But I dreamed of a time when I could actually\n\n1:53:00.340 --> 1:53:02.160\n afford the full experience.\n\n1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:05.920\n And this is kind of this dreamland beyond the horizon\n\n1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:09.380\n when you could find out what else is there.\n\n1:53:09.380 --> 1:53:14.380\n In some sense, even just playing the shareware was,\n\n1:53:14.380 --> 1:53:17.980\n it's the limitation of that.\n\n1:53:17.980 --> 1:53:21.540\n You know, life is limited, eventually we all die.\n\n1:53:21.540 --> 1:53:26.540\n In that way, shareware was somehow really fulfilling\n\n1:53:26.820 --> 1:53:31.580\n to have this kind of mysterious thing beyond what's free\n\n1:53:31.580 --> 1:53:32.420\n always there.\n\n1:53:32.420 --> 1:53:35.420\n It's kind of, I don't know, maybe it's because\n\n1:53:35.420 --> 1:53:37.580\n a part of my childhood is playing shareware games.\n\n1:53:37.580 --> 1:53:39.520\n That was a really fulfilling experience.\n\n1:53:39.520 --> 1:53:43.100\n It's so interesting how that model still brought joy\n\n1:53:43.100 --> 1:53:44.020\n to so many people.\n\n1:53:44.020 --> 1:53:45.980\n The 20X people that played it.\n\n1:53:45.980 --> 1:53:47.340\n I felt very good about that.\n\n1:53:47.340 --> 1:53:49.700\n I would run into people that would say,\n\n1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:52.220\n oh, I loved that game that you had early on,\n\n1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:53.500\n Commander Keen, whatever.\n\n1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:57.500\n And no, they meant just the first episode\n\n1:53:57.500 --> 1:53:58.740\n that they got to see everywhere.\n\n1:53:58.740 --> 1:54:01.020\n That's me, I played the crap out of Commander Keen.\n\n1:54:01.020 --> 1:54:03.300\n And that was all good.\n\n1:54:03.300 --> 1:54:04.140\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:54:04.140 --> 1:54:06.780\n But so we were in this position where Scott Miller\n\n1:54:06.780 --> 1:54:10.420\n was just fronting us cash, saying, yeah, make a game.\n\n1:54:10.420 --> 1:54:14.140\n But we did not properly pull the trigger and say,\n\n1:54:14.140 --> 1:54:16.380\n all right, we're quitting our jobs.\n\n1:54:16.380 --> 1:54:17.940\n We were like, we're gonna do both.\n\n1:54:17.940 --> 1:54:21.280\n We're gonna keep working at Softdisk, working on this.\n\n1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:24.740\n And then we're going to go ahead and make a new game\n\n1:54:24.740 --> 1:54:27.060\n for Apogee at the same time.\n\n1:54:27.060 --> 1:54:29.580\n And this eventually did lead to some legal problems.\n\n1:54:29.580 --> 1:54:31.100\n And we had trouble.\n\n1:54:31.100 --> 1:54:32.820\n It all got worked out in the end,\n\n1:54:32.820 --> 1:54:35.860\n but it was not a good call at the time there.\n\n1:54:35.860 --> 1:54:39.380\n And your legal mind at the time was not stellar.\n\n1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:42.340\n You were not thinking in terms of the illegal terms.\n\n1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:44.020\n No, I definitely wasn't.\n\n1:54:44.020 --> 1:54:45.240\n None of us were.\n\n1:54:46.140 --> 1:54:47.620\n And in hindsight, yeah, it's like,\n\n1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:48.940\n how did we think we were gonna get away\n\n1:54:48.940 --> 1:54:51.180\n with even using our work computers\n\n1:54:51.180 --> 1:54:56.180\n to write software for our breakaway new company?\n\n1:54:56.820 --> 1:54:58.420\n It was not a good plan.\n\n1:54:58.420 --> 1:55:00.980\n How did Commander Keen come to be?\n\n1:55:00.980 --> 1:55:04.100\n So the design process, we would start from,\n\n1:55:04.100 --> 1:55:05.900\n we had some idea of what we wanted to do.\n\n1:55:05.900 --> 1:55:08.340\n We wanted to do a Mario like game.\n\n1:55:08.340 --> 1:55:10.180\n It was gonna be a side scroller.\n\n1:55:10.180 --> 1:55:11.800\n It was gonna use the technology.\n\n1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:14.340\n We had some sense of what it would have to look like\n\n1:55:14.340 --> 1:55:15.500\n because of the limitations\n\n1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:17.980\n of this adaptive tile refresh technology.\n\n1:55:17.980 --> 1:55:21.220\n It had to have fields of relatively constant tiles.\n\n1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:23.500\n You couldn't just paint up a background\n\n1:55:23.500 --> 1:55:25.000\n and then move that around.\n\n1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:28.620\n The early design or all the design for Commander Keen\n\n1:55:28.620 --> 1:55:30.020\n really came from Tom Hall,\n\n1:55:30.020 --> 1:55:34.900\n where he was kind of the main creative mind\n\n1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:36.940\n for the early id software stuff,\n\n1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:39.080\n where we had an interesting division of things\n\n1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:42.220\n where Tom was all creative and design.\n\n1:55:42.220 --> 1:55:43.620\n I was all programming.\n\n1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:45.540\n John Romero was an interesting bridge\n\n1:55:45.540 --> 1:55:47.740\n where he was both a very good programmer\n\n1:55:47.740 --> 1:55:50.140\n and also a very good designer and artist\n\n1:55:50.140 --> 1:55:52.500\n and kind of straddled between the areas.\n\n1:55:52.500 --> 1:55:55.540\n But Commander Keen was very much Tom Hall's baby.\n\n1:55:55.540 --> 1:55:59.300\n And he came up with all the design and backstory\n\n1:55:59.300 --> 1:56:02.340\n for the different things of kind of a mad scientist,\n\n1:56:02.340 --> 1:56:06.460\n little kid with building a rocket ship\n\n1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:09.100\n and a zap gun and visiting alien worlds\n\n1:56:09.100 --> 1:56:11.540\n and doing all of this that the background\n\n1:56:11.540 --> 1:56:13.620\n that we lay the game inside of.\n\n1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:16.780\n And there's not a whole lot to any of these things.\n\n1:56:16.780 --> 1:56:19.540\n Design for us was always just what we needed to do\n\n1:56:19.540 --> 1:56:23.060\n to make the game that was gonna be so much fun to play.\n\n1:56:23.060 --> 1:56:26.820\n And we laid out our first trilogy of games,\n\n1:56:26.820 --> 1:56:29.460\n the shareware formula, it's gonna be three pieces.\n\n1:56:29.460 --> 1:56:31.780\n We make Commander Keen one, two, and three.\n\n1:56:31.780 --> 1:56:35.820\n And we just really started busting on all that work.\n\n1:56:35.820 --> 1:56:37.700\n And it went together really quickly.\n\n1:56:37.700 --> 1:56:39.580\n It was like three months or something\n\n1:56:39.580 --> 1:56:41.940\n that while we were still making games every month\n\n1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:45.500\n for Gamer's Edge, we were sharing technology between that.\n\n1:56:45.500 --> 1:56:46.820\n I'd write a bunch of code for this\n\n1:56:46.820 --> 1:56:48.980\n and we'd just kind of use it for both.\n\n1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:50.900\n Again, not a particularly good idea there\n\n1:56:50.900 --> 1:56:53.020\n that had consequences for us.\n\n1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:57.220\n But in three months, we got our first game out\n\n1:56:57.220 --> 1:57:00.660\n and all of a sudden it was three times as successful\n\n1:57:00.660 --> 1:57:03.060\n as the most successful thing Apogee had had before.\n\n1:57:03.060 --> 1:57:05.780\n And we were making like $30,000 a month\n\n1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:09.060\n immediately from the Commander Keen stuff.\n\n1:57:09.060 --> 1:57:11.700\n And that was again, a surprise to us.\n\n1:57:11.700 --> 1:57:15.300\n It was more than we thought that that was gonna make.\n\n1:57:15.300 --> 1:57:17.340\n And we said, well, we're gonna certainly roll\n\n1:57:17.340 --> 1:57:19.980\n into another set of titles from this.\n\n1:57:19.980 --> 1:57:21.800\n And in that three months, I had come up\n\n1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:24.860\n with a much better way of doing the scrolling technology\n\n1:57:24.860 --> 1:57:27.220\n that was not the adaptive tile refresh,\n\n1:57:27.220 --> 1:57:29.200\n which in some ways was even simpler.\n\n1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:33.440\n And these things, so many of the great ideas of technology\n\n1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:36.300\n are things that are back of the envelope designs.\n\n1:57:36.300 --> 1:57:38.400\n I make this comment about modern machine learning\n\n1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:40.780\n where all the things that are really important\n\n1:57:40.780 --> 1:57:42.740\n practically in the last decade are,\n\n1:57:42.740 --> 1:57:44.460\n each of them fits on the back of an envelope.\n\n1:57:44.460 --> 1:57:46.340\n There are these simple little things.\n\n1:57:46.340 --> 1:57:51.340\n They're not super dense, hard to understand technologies.\n\n1:57:51.340 --> 1:57:55.060\n And so the second scrolling trick was just a matter of like,\n\n1:57:55.060 --> 1:57:58.560\n okay, we know we've got this 64K window.\n\n1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:00.040\n And the question was always like,\n\n1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:02.260\n well, you could make a two by two,\n\n1:58:02.260 --> 1:58:05.500\n but you can't go off the edge.\n\n1:58:05.500 --> 1:58:07.800\n But I finally asked, well, what actually happens\n\n1:58:07.800 --> 1:58:09.600\n if you just go off the edge?\n\n1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:12.260\n If you take your start and you say, it's like,\n\n1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:14.460\n okay, I can move over, I'm scrolling,\n\n1:58:14.460 --> 1:58:16.920\n I can move over, I can move down, I'm scrolling.\n\n1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:19.780\n I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window.\n\n1:58:19.780 --> 1:58:21.620\n It's like, well, what if I just keep going?\n\n1:58:21.620 --> 1:58:24.020\n And I say, I'm gonna start at,\n\n1:58:24.020 --> 1:58:26.380\n what happens if I start at FFFE\n\n1:58:26.380 --> 1:58:29.420\n at the very end of the 64K block?\n\n1:58:29.420 --> 1:58:32.420\n And it turns out it just wraps back around to the top\n\n1:58:32.420 --> 1:58:33.300\n of the block.\n\n1:58:33.300 --> 1:58:35.860\n And I'm like, oh, well, this makes everything easy.\n\n1:58:35.860 --> 1:58:37.620\n You can just scroll the screen everywhere\n\n1:58:37.620 --> 1:58:40.420\n and all you have to draw is just one new line of tiles,\n\n1:58:40.420 --> 1:58:42.100\n which everything you expose,\n\n1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:44.660\n it might be unaligned off various parts\n\n1:58:44.660 --> 1:58:48.180\n of the screen memory, but it just works.\n\n1:58:48.180 --> 1:58:50.820\n That no longer had the problem of you had to have fields\n\n1:58:50.820 --> 1:58:53.720\n of the similar colors because it doesn't matter\n\n1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:54.980\n what you're doing, you could be having\n\n1:58:54.980 --> 1:58:57.780\n a completely unique world and you're just drawing\n\n1:58:57.780 --> 1:58:59.460\n the new strip as it comes on.\n\n1:58:59.460 --> 1:59:02.180\n But it might be, like you said, unaligned,\n\n1:59:02.180 --> 1:59:03.500\n so it can be all over the place.\n\n1:59:03.500 --> 1:59:04.960\n Yes, and it turns out it doesn't matter.\n\n1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:06.700\n I would have two page flipped screens,\n\n1:59:06.700 --> 1:59:09.120\n as long as they didn't overlap, they moved in series\n\n1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:12.900\n through this two dimensional window of graphics.\n\n1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:15.700\n And that was one of those like, well, this is so simple.\n\n1:59:15.700 --> 1:59:19.420\n This just works, it's faster,\n\n1:59:19.420 --> 1:59:21.740\n there it seemed like there was no downside.\n\n1:59:21.740 --> 1:59:25.540\n Funny thing was, it turned out after we shipped titles\n\n1:59:25.540 --> 1:59:29.660\n with this, there were what they called super VGA cards,\n\n1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:31.940\n the cards that would allow higher resolutions\n\n1:59:31.940 --> 1:59:35.740\n and different features that the standard ones didn't.\n\n1:59:35.740 --> 1:59:38.340\n And on some of those cards,\n\n1:59:38.340 --> 1:59:40.360\n this was a weird compatibility quirk again,\n\n1:59:40.360 --> 1:59:41.900\n because nobody thought this was not\n\n1:59:41.900 --> 1:59:43.580\n what it was designed to do.\n\n1:59:43.580 --> 1:59:45.620\n And some of those cards had more memory.\n\n1:59:45.620 --> 1:59:48.820\n They had more than just 256K and four planes.\n\n1:59:48.820 --> 1:59:51.500\n They had 512K or a megabyte.\n\n1:59:51.500 --> 1:59:55.660\n And on some of those cards, I scroll my window down\n\n1:59:55.660 --> 1:59:57.900\n and then it goes into uninitialized memory\n\n1:59:57.900 --> 1:59:59.060\n that actually exists there\n\n1:59:59.060 --> 2:00:01.740\n rather than wrapping back around at the top.\n\n2:00:01.740 --> 2:00:04.180\n And then I was in the tough position\n\n2:00:04.180 --> 2:00:06.260\n of do I have to track every single one of these?\n\n2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:07.860\n And it was a mad house back then\n\n2:00:07.860 --> 2:00:10.700\n with there were 20 different video card vendors\n\n2:00:10.700 --> 2:00:12.700\n with all slightly different implementations\n\n2:00:12.700 --> 2:00:14.820\n of their nonstandard functionality.\n\n2:00:14.820 --> 2:00:17.540\n So either I needed to natively program\n\n2:00:17.540 --> 2:00:22.080\n all of the VGA cards there to map in that memory\n\n2:00:22.080 --> 2:00:24.320\n and keep scrolling down through all of that,\n\n2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:27.180\n or I kind of punted and took the easy solution\n\n2:00:27.180 --> 2:00:30.300\n of when you finally did run to the edge of the screen,\n\n2:00:30.300 --> 2:00:33.340\n I accepted a hitch and just copied the whole screen up there.\n\n2:00:33.340 --> 2:00:38.340\n So on some of those cards, it was a compatibility mode.\n\n2:00:38.340 --> 2:00:40.140\n In the normal ones, when it all worked fine,\n\n2:00:40.140 --> 2:00:42.060\n everything was just beautifully smooth.\n\n2:00:42.060 --> 2:00:43.460\n But if you had one of those cards\n\n2:00:43.460 --> 2:00:46.340\n where it did not wrap the way I wanted it to,\n\n2:00:46.340 --> 2:00:48.820\n you'd be scrolling around, scrolling around,\n\n2:00:48.820 --> 2:00:50.580\n and then eventually you'd have a little hitch\n\n2:00:50.580 --> 2:00:52.860\n where 200 milliseconds or something\n\n2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:56.100\n that was not super smooth as it froze a little bit.\n\n2:00:56.100 --> 2:00:57.860\n And this is the binary thing.\n\n2:00:57.860 --> 2:00:59.660\n Is it one of the standard screens\n\n2:00:59.660 --> 2:01:02.060\n or is it one of the weird ones, the Super VGA ones?\n\n2:01:02.060 --> 2:01:03.020\n Yeah. Okay.\n\n2:01:03.020 --> 2:01:04.500\n And so we would default to,\n\n2:01:04.500 --> 2:01:05.900\n and I think that was one of those\n\n2:01:05.900 --> 2:01:09.020\n that changed over the kind of course of deployment\n\n2:01:09.020 --> 2:01:11.060\n where early on we would have a normal mode\n\n2:01:11.060 --> 2:01:13.500\n and then you would enable the compatibility flag\n\n2:01:13.500 --> 2:01:16.140\n if your screen did this crazy flickery thing\n\n2:01:16.140 --> 2:01:18.620\n when you got to a certain point in the game.\n\n2:01:18.620 --> 2:01:21.420\n And then later, I think it probably got enabled by default\n\n2:01:21.420 --> 2:01:23.500\n as just more and more of the cards\n\n2:01:23.500 --> 2:01:26.140\n kind of did not do exactly the right thing.\n\n2:01:26.140 --> 2:01:27.500\n And that's the two edged sword\n\n2:01:27.500 --> 2:01:30.340\n of doing unconventional things with technology\n\n2:01:30.340 --> 2:01:33.060\n where you can find something that nobody thought about\n\n2:01:33.060 --> 2:01:34.540\n doing that kind of scrolling trick\n\n2:01:34.540 --> 2:01:36.780\n when they set up those cards.\n\n2:01:36.780 --> 2:01:39.100\n But the fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason\n\n2:01:39.100 --> 2:01:40.820\n when I was relying on that,\n\n2:01:40.820 --> 2:01:44.020\n then I wound up being broken on some of the later cards.\n\n2:01:44.020 --> 2:01:45.740\n Let me take a bit of a tangent,\n\n2:01:45.740 --> 2:01:50.260\n but ask you about the hacker ethic.\n\n2:01:50.260 --> 2:01:51.780\n Cause you mentioned shareware.\n\n2:01:51.780 --> 2:01:53.180\n It's an interesting world.\n\n2:01:53.180 --> 2:01:56.660\n The world of people that make money,\n\n2:01:56.660 --> 2:02:00.500\n the business and the people that build systems,\n\n2:02:00.500 --> 2:02:02.060\n the engineers.\n\n2:02:02.060 --> 2:02:05.980\n And what is the hacker ethic?\n\n2:02:05.980 --> 2:02:08.440\n You've been a man of the people\n\n2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:12.460\n and you've embodied at least the part of that ethic.\n\n2:02:12.460 --> 2:02:13.300\n What does it mean?\n\n2:02:13.300 --> 2:02:14.460\n What did it mean to you at the time?\n\n2:02:14.460 --> 2:02:15.820\n What does it mean to you today?\n\n2:02:15.820 --> 2:02:17.900\n So Steven Levy's book, Hackers,\n\n2:02:17.900 --> 2:02:21.620\n was a really formative book for me as a teenager.\n\n2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:23.660\n I mean, I read it several times\n\n2:02:23.660 --> 2:02:26.020\n and there was all of the great lore\n\n2:02:26.020 --> 2:02:28.980\n of the early MIT era of hackers\n\n2:02:28.980 --> 2:02:31.000\n and ending up at the end with,\n\n2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:34.100\n it kind of went through the early MIT hackers\n\n2:02:34.100 --> 2:02:36.120\n and then the Silicon Valley hardware hackers\n\n2:02:36.120 --> 2:02:39.460\n and then the game hackers in part three.\n\n2:02:39.460 --> 2:02:41.740\n And at that time as a teenager,\n\n2:02:41.740 --> 2:02:44.700\n I really was kind of bitter in some ways.\n\n2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:46.280\n I thought I was born too late.\n\n2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:48.980\n I thought I missed the window there.\n\n2:02:48.980 --> 2:02:52.020\n And I really thought I belonged in that third section\n\n2:02:52.020 --> 2:02:53.620\n of that book with the game hackers.\n\n2:02:53.620 --> 2:02:56.740\n And they were talking about the Williams at Sierra\n\n2:02:56.740 --> 2:02:59.340\n and origin systems with Richard Garriott.\n\n2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:02.540\n And it's like, I really wanted to be there.\n\n2:03:02.540 --> 2:03:05.580\n And I knew that was now a few years in the past.\n\n2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:08.700\n It was not to be,\n\n2:03:08.700 --> 2:03:12.500\n but the early days, especially the early MIT hacker days,\n\n2:03:12.500 --> 2:03:16.100\n talking a lot about this sense of the hacker ethic,\n\n2:03:16.100 --> 2:03:17.980\n that there was this sense that\n\n2:03:17.980 --> 2:03:20.720\n it was about sharing information, being good,\n\n2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:22.460\n not keeping it to yourself,\n\n2:03:22.460 --> 2:03:24.740\n and that it's not a zero sum game,\n\n2:03:24.740 --> 2:03:28.400\n that you can share something with another programmer\n\n2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:30.780\n and it doesn't take it away from you.\n\n2:03:30.780 --> 2:03:33.120\n You then have somebody else doing something.\n\n2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:35.940\n And I also think that there's an aspect of it\n\n2:03:35.940 --> 2:03:39.180\n where it's this ability to take joy\n\n2:03:39.180 --> 2:03:41.200\n in other people's accomplishments,\n\n2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:43.020\n where it's not the cutthroat bit of like,\n\n2:03:43.020 --> 2:03:44.060\n I have to be first,\n\n2:03:44.060 --> 2:03:47.380\n I have to be recognized as the one that did this\n\n2:03:47.380 --> 2:03:48.220\n in some way,\n\n2:03:48.220 --> 2:03:51.560\n but being able to see somebody else do something\n\n2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:53.620\n and say, holy shit, that's amazing.\n\n2:03:53.620 --> 2:03:56.900\n And just taking joy in the ability of something amazing\n\n2:03:56.900 --> 2:03:58.780\n that somebody else does.\n\n2:03:58.780 --> 2:04:03.780\n And the big thing that I was able to do through ID Software\n\n2:04:03.780 --> 2:04:07.160\n was this ability to eventually release the source code\n\n2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:08.080\n for most of our,\n\n2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:10.720\n like all of our really seminal game titles.\n\n2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:13.640\n And that was a, it was a stepping stone process\n\n2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:16.500\n where we were kind of surprised early on\n\n2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:20.120\n where people were able to hack the existing games.\n\n2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:21.540\n And of course I had experience with that.\n\n2:04:21.540 --> 2:04:23.480\n I remember hacking my copies of Ultima.\n\n2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:27.080\n So I'd give myself 9999 gold and raise my levels\n\n2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.080\n and break out the sector editor.\n\n2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:31.040\n And so I was familiar with all of that.\n\n2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:33.000\n So it was just, it was with a smile\n\n2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.620\n when I started to see people doing that to our games,\n\n2:04:35.620 --> 2:04:38.940\n I am making level editors for Commander Keen\n\n2:04:38.940 --> 2:04:41.820\n or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D,\n\n2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:44.940\n but I made the pitch internally\n\n2:04:44.940 --> 2:04:47.560\n that we should actually release our own tools\n\n2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:51.440\n for like what we did, what we use to create the games.\n\n2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:55.100\n And that was a little bit debatable about,\n\n2:04:55.100 --> 2:04:57.920\n well, will this let other, we'll give people leg up.\n\n2:04:57.920 --> 2:04:58.760\n It's always like,\n\n2:04:58.760 --> 2:05:00.940\n what's that gonna mean for the competition?\n\n2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:04.760\n But the really hard pitch was to actually release\n\n2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:06.800\n the full source code for the games.\n\n2:05:06.800 --> 2:05:10.360\n And it was a balancing act with the other people\n\n2:05:10.360 --> 2:05:13.320\n inside the company where it's interesting\n\n2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:17.060\n how the programmers generally did get,\n\n2:05:17.060 --> 2:05:20.360\n certainly the people that I worked closely with,\n\n2:05:20.360 --> 2:05:22.600\n they did kind of get that hacker ethic bit\n\n2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:24.660\n where you wanted to share your code.\n\n2:05:24.660 --> 2:05:25.780\n You were proud of it.\n\n2:05:25.780 --> 2:05:28.920\n You wanted other people to take it, do cool things with it.\n\n2:05:28.920 --> 2:05:33.880\n But interestingly, the broader game industry\n\n2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:36.520\n is a little more hesitant to embrace that\n\n2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:38.000\n than like the group of people\n\n2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.160\n that we happen to have at id Software,\n\n2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:42.520\n where it was always a little interesting to me\n\n2:05:42.520 --> 2:05:45.600\n seeing how a lot of people in the game modding community\n\n2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:47.640\n were very possessive of their code.\n\n2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:49.320\n They did not wanna share their code.\n\n2:05:49.320 --> 2:05:50.560\n They wanted it to be theirs.\n\n2:05:50.560 --> 2:05:52.640\n It was their claim to fame.\n\n2:05:52.640 --> 2:05:55.400\n And that was much more like what we tended to see\n\n2:05:55.400 --> 2:05:58.360\n with artists where the artists understand something\n\n2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:02.200\n about credit and wanting it to be known as their work.\n\n2:06:02.200 --> 2:06:05.320\n And a lot of the game programmers\n\n2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:07.020\n felt a little bit more like artists\n\n2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:08.600\n than like hacker programmers,\n\n2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:11.000\n in that it was about building something\n\n2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:13.000\n that maybe felt more like art to them\n\n2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:16.760\n than the more tool based and exploration based\n\n2:06:16.760 --> 2:06:19.060\n kind of hacking culture side of things.\n\n2:06:19.060 --> 2:06:23.760\n Yeah, it's so interesting that this kind of fear\n\n2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:27.860\n that credit will not be sufficiently attributed to you.\n\n2:06:27.860 --> 2:06:30.400\n And that's one of the things that I do bump into a lot\n\n2:06:30.400 --> 2:06:34.240\n because I try not to go...\n\n2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:35.400\n I mean, it's easy for me to say\n\n2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:37.240\n because so much credit is heaped on me\n\n2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:39.360\n for the id Software side of things.\n\n2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:42.200\n But when people come up and they wanna pick a fight\n\n2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:45.120\n and say, no, it's like that wasn't where first person gaming\n\n2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:48.860\n came from and you can point to some of like things\n\n2:06:48.860 --> 2:06:51.600\n on obscure titles that I was never aware of\n\n2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:53.340\n or like the old Playdoh systems\n\n2:06:53.340 --> 2:06:57.000\n or each personal computer had something that was 3Dish\n\n2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.320\n and moving around.\n\n2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:01.200\n And I'm happy to say it's like, no, I mean,\n\n2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:03.900\n I saw Battlezone and Star Wars in the arcades.\n\n2:07:03.900 --> 2:07:06.360\n I had seen 3D graphics, I had seen all these things\n\n2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:09.100\n that are standing on the shoulders of lots of other people.\n\n2:07:09.100 --> 2:07:10.880\n But sometimes these examples they pull out,\n\n2:07:10.880 --> 2:07:12.540\n it's like, no, I didn't know that existed.\n\n2:07:12.540 --> 2:07:15.280\n I mean, I had never heard of that before then\n\n2:07:15.280 --> 2:07:17.840\n that didn't contribute to what I made,\n\n2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:19.480\n but there's plenty of stuff that did.\n\n2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:23.280\n And I think there's good cases to be made\n\n2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:26.160\n that obviously Doom and Quake and Wolfenstein\n\n2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:29.800\n were formative examples for what everything\n\n2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:31.720\n that came after that.\n\n2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:34.160\n But I don't feel the need to go fight\n\n2:07:34.160 --> 2:07:37.480\n and say claim primacy or initial invention\n\n2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:38.800\n of anything like that.\n\n2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:40.440\n But a lot of people do want to.\n\n2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:43.200\n I think when you fight for the credit in that way\n\n2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:45.260\n and it does go against the hacker ethic,\n\n2:07:46.280 --> 2:07:48.800\n you destroy something fundamental about the culture,\n\n2:07:48.800 --> 2:07:51.760\n about the community that builds cool stuff.\n\n2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:53.780\n I think credit ultimately,\n\n2:07:53.780 --> 2:07:58.420\n so I had this sort of,\n\n2:07:58.420 --> 2:08:00.980\n there's a famous wrestler and freestyle wrestling\n\n2:08:00.980 --> 2:08:03.980\n called Buvai Sarasateeva.\n\n2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:07.760\n And he always preached that you should just focus\n\n2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:10.740\n on the art of the wrestling and let people\n\n2:08:12.740 --> 2:08:15.940\n write your story however they want.\n\n2:08:15.940 --> 2:08:20.100\n The highest form of the art is just focusing on the art.\n\n2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:23.760\n And that is something about the hacker ethic\n\n2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:26.900\n is just focus on building cool stuff,\n\n2:08:26.900 --> 2:08:29.380\n sharing it with other cool people,\n\n2:08:29.380 --> 2:08:32.500\n and credit will get assigned correctly\n\n2:08:35.060 --> 2:08:37.240\n in the long arc of history.\n\n2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:39.180\n Yeah, and I generally think that's true.\n\n2:08:39.180 --> 2:08:40.060\n And you've got,\n\n2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:44.220\n there's some things, there's a graphics technique\n\n2:08:44.220 --> 2:08:46.220\n that got labeled CarMax Reverse.\n\n2:08:46.220 --> 2:08:48.380\n I am literally named,\n\n2:08:48.380 --> 2:08:50.300\n and it turned out that I wasn't the first person\n\n2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:51.860\n to figure that out.\n\n2:08:51.860 --> 2:08:54.700\n Most scientific things or mathematical things you wind up,\n\n2:08:54.700 --> 2:08:56.220\n it's like, oh, this other person\n\n2:08:56.220 --> 2:08:58.580\n had actually done that somewhat before.\n\n2:08:58.580 --> 2:09:00.300\n And then there's things that get attributed to me\n\n2:09:00.300 --> 2:09:03.300\n like the inverse square root hack that I actually didn't do.\n\n2:09:03.300 --> 2:09:04.760\n I flat out, that wasn't me.\n\n2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:07.260\n And it's like, it's weird how the memetic power\n\n2:09:07.260 --> 2:09:09.100\n of the internet, I cannot convince people of that.\n\n2:09:09.100 --> 2:09:10.980\n You're like the Mark Twain of programming.\n\n2:09:10.980 --> 2:09:12.140\n Yes.\n\n2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:14.060\n Everything just gets attributed to you now,\n\n2:09:14.060 --> 2:09:17.380\n even though you've never sought the credit of things.\n\n2:09:18.300 --> 2:09:21.220\n But part of the fact of the humility behind that\n\n2:09:21.220 --> 2:09:24.100\n is what attracts the attributions.\n\n2:09:25.340 --> 2:09:27.820\n Let's talk about a game.\n\n2:09:27.820 --> 2:09:29.580\n I mean, one of the greatest games ever made.\n\n2:09:29.580 --> 2:09:31.500\n I know you could talk about doing Quake and so on,\n\n2:09:31.500 --> 2:09:33.700\n but to me, Wolfenstein 3D was like, whoa.\n\n2:09:35.340 --> 2:09:38.180\n It blew my mind that a world like this could exist.\n\n2:09:38.180 --> 2:09:40.900\n So how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be\n\n2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:44.260\n in terms of the programming, in terms of the design,\n\n2:09:44.260 --> 2:09:47.240\n in terms of some of the memorable technical challenges?\n\n2:09:47.240 --> 2:09:50.600\n And also, actually just something you haven't mentioned\n\n2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:55.600\n is how did these ideas come to be inside your mind,\n\n2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:00.560\n the adaptive side scrolling,\n\n2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:03.560\n the solutions to these technical challenges?\n\n2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:06.900\n So I usually can introspectively pull back\n\n2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:11.360\n pretty detailed accounts of how technology solutions\n\n2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:14.000\n and design choices on my part came to be,\n\n2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:17.400\n where technically we had done two games,\n\n2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:19.200\n 3D games like that before,\n\n2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:20.960\n where Hover Tank was the first one,\n\n2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:22.760\n which had flat shaded walls,\n\n2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:25.240\n but did have the scaled enemies inside it.\n\n2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:28.920\n And then Catacombs 3D, which had textured walls,\n\n2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:33.920\n scaled enemies, and some more functionality,\n\n2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:37.160\n like the disappearing walls and some other stuff.\n\n2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:38.680\n But what's really interesting\n\n2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:41.980\n from a game development standpoint is those games,\n\n2:10:41.980 --> 2:10:45.000\n Catacombs 3D, Hover Tank, and Wolfenstein,\n\n2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:48.240\n they literally used the same code\n\n2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:50.280\n for a lot of the character behavior\n\n2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:54.140\n that a 2D game that I had made earlier called Catacombs did,\n\n2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:56.740\n where it was an overhead view game, kind of like Gauntlet,\n\n2:10:56.740 --> 2:10:58.800\n you're running around and you can open up doors,\n\n2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:01.280\n pick up items, basic game stuff.\n\n2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:06.280\n And the thought was that this exact same game experience\n\n2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:09.080\n just presented in a different perspective.\n\n2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:11.380\n It could be literally the same game\n\n2:11:11.380 --> 2:11:13.480\n just with a different view into it,\n\n2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:16.880\n would have a dramatically different impact on the players.\n\n2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:20.280\n So it wasn't a true 3D,\n\n2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:22.440\n you're saying that you could kind of fake it,\n\n2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:24.160\n you can like scale enemies,\n\n2:11:24.160 --> 2:11:25.720\n meaning things that are farther away,\n\n2:11:25.720 --> 2:11:27.440\n you can make them smaller.\n\n2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:29.760\n So the game was a 2D map,\n\n2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:33.040\n like all of our games use the same tool for creation.\n\n2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:36.320\n We use the same map editor for creating Keen as Wolfenstein\n\n2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:39.100\n and Hover Tank and Catacombs and all this stuff.\n\n2:11:39.100 --> 2:11:42.680\n So the game was a 2D grid made out of blocks.\n\n2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:44.480\n And you could say, well, these are walls,\n\n2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:45.880\n these are where the enemies start,\n\n2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:47.700\n then they start moving around.\n\n2:11:47.700 --> 2:11:49.600\n And these early games like Catacombs,\n\n2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:51.600\n you played it strictly in a 2D view.\n\n2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:53.200\n It was a scrolling 2D view,\n\n2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:55.320\n and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh\n\n2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:58.440\n at the time to be able to do something like that.\n\n2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:01.620\n And then the thought that these early games,\n\n2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:04.600\n all it did was take the same basic enemy logic,\n\n2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:07.680\n but instead of seeing it from the God's eye view on top,\n\n2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:10.480\n you were inside it and turning from side to side,\n\n2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:12.640\n yawing your view and moving forwards and backwards\n\n2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:14.520\n and side to side.\n\n2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:17.160\n And it's a striking thing where you always talk about\n\n2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:20.040\n wanting to isolate and factor changes in values.\n\n2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:22.360\n And this was one of those most pure cases there\n\n2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:25.040\n where the rest of the game changed very little.\n\n2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:27.840\n It was our normal kind of change the colors on something\n\n2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:29.200\n and draw a different picture for it,\n\n2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:30.880\n but it's kind of the same thing.\n\n2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:33.960\n But the perspective changed in a really fundamental way.\n\n2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:36.280\n And it was dramatically different.\n\n2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:40.600\n I can remember the reactions where the artist, Adrian,\n\n2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:42.040\n that had been drawing the pictures for it.\n\n2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:45.000\n We had a cool big troll thing in Catacombs 3D,\n\n2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:47.720\n and we had these walls that you could get a key\n\n2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:49.840\n and you could make the blocks disappear,\n\n2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:51.000\n get really simple stuff.\n\n2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:52.920\n Blocks could either be there or not there.\n\n2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:55.980\n So our idea of a door was being able to make a set of blocks\n\n2:12:55.980 --> 2:12:57.300\n just disappear.\n\n2:12:57.300 --> 2:12:58.640\n And I remember the reaction\n\n2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:00.080\n where he had drawn these characters\n\n2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:01.720\n and he was slowly moving around\n\n2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:04.480\n and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.\n\n2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:05.460\n It was all still keyboard.\n\n2:13:05.460 --> 2:13:08.520\n We didn't even have mice set up at that time,\n\n2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:12.300\n but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.\n\n2:13:12.300 --> 2:13:14.360\n The wall disappears in a little animation\n\n2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:16.320\n and there's a monster like right there.\n\n2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:18.000\n And he practically fell out of his chair.\n\n2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:19.260\n It was just like, ah!\n\n2:13:19.260 --> 2:13:22.480\n And games just didn't do that.\n\n2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:24.360\n The games were the God's eye view.\n\n2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:26.320\n You were a little invested in your little guy.\n\n2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:29.760\n You can be like happy or sad when things happen,\n\n2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:32.440\n but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.\n\n2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:33.920\n You weren't inside the game.\n\n2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:35.560\n Something in the back of your brain,\n\n2:13:35.560 --> 2:13:37.760\n some reptile brain thing is just going,\n\n2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:39.960\n oh shit, something just happened.\n\n2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:42.520\n And that was one of those early points where it's like,\n\n2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:44.800\n yeah, this is gonna make a difference.\n\n2:13:44.800 --> 2:13:47.440\n This is going to be powerful and it's gonna matter.\n\n2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:51.120\n Were you able to imagine that in the idea stage or no?\n\n2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:53.720\n So not that exact thing.\n\n2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:56.480\n So again, we had cases like the arcade games,\n\n2:13:56.480 --> 2:13:58.000\n Battle Zone and Star Wars\n\n2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.160\n that you could kind of see a 3D world\n\n2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:03.460\n and things coming at you and you get some sense of it,\n\n2:14:03.460 --> 2:14:06.440\n but nothing had done the kind of worlds that we were doing\n\n2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:08.480\n and the sort of action based things.\n\n2:14:08.480 --> 2:14:12.100\n 3D at the time was really largely\n\n2:14:12.100 --> 2:14:14.240\n about the simulation thoughts.\n\n2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:16.320\n And this is something that really\n\n2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:18.120\n might have trended differently\n\n2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:20.960\n if not for the id Software approach in the games\n\n2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:23.560\n where there were flight simulators,\n\n2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:24.920\n there were driving simulators,\n\n2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:28.400\n you had like hard drive in and Microsoft flight simulator.\n\n2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:31.360\n And these were doing 3D and general purpose 3D\n\n2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:33.760\n in ways that were more flexible\n\n2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:35.440\n than what we were doing with our games,\n\n2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:38.000\n but they were looked at as simulations.\n\n2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:42.000\n They weren't trying to necessarily be fast or responsive\n\n2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.840\n or letting you do kind of exciting maneuvers\n\n2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:46.800\n because they were trying to simulate reality\n\n2:14:46.800 --> 2:14:49.280\n and they were taking their cues from the big systems,\n\n2:14:49.280 --> 2:14:51.500\n the Evans and Sutherlands and the Silicon Graphics\n\n2:14:51.500 --> 2:14:52.860\n that were doing things.\n\n2:14:52.860 --> 2:14:54.600\n But we were taking our cues\n\n2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:56.560\n from the console and arcade games.\n\n2:14:56.560 --> 2:14:59.480\n We wanted things that were sort of quarter eaters\n\n2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:01.160\n that were doing fast paced things\n\n2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:02.780\n that you could smack you around\n\n2:15:02.780 --> 2:15:06.180\n rather than just smoothly gliding you from place to place.\n\n2:15:06.180 --> 2:15:07.020\n So.\n\n2:15:07.020 --> 2:15:07.840\n Quarter eaters.\n\n2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:08.680\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:10.200\n And you know, a funny thing is,\n\n2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:12.280\n so much that that built into us\n\n2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:15.080\n that Wolfenstein still had lives\n\n2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:16.540\n and you had like one of the biggest power ups\n\n2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:18.800\n in all these games like was an extra life\n\n2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:20.560\n because you started off with three lives\n\n2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:23.080\n and you lose your lives and then it's game over\n\n2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:26.240\n and there weren't save games in most of this stuff.\n\n2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:28.760\n It was, it sounds almost crazy to say this,\n\n2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:30.680\n but it was an innovation in Doom\n\n2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:32.160\n to not have lives.\n\n2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:33.860\n You know, you could just play Doom as long as you wanted.\n\n2:15:33.860 --> 2:15:36.760\n You just restart at the start of the level and why not?\n\n2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:39.760\n This is like, we aren't trying to take people's quarters.\n\n2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:41.360\n They've already paid for the entire game.\n\n2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:43.360\n We want them to have a good time\n\n2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:45.520\n and you would have some, you know,\n\n2:15:45.520 --> 2:15:47.240\n some old timer purists that might think\n\n2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:48.940\n that there's something to the epic journey\n\n2:15:48.940 --> 2:15:50.040\n of making it to the end,\n\n2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:52.040\n having to restart all the way from the beginning\n\n2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:53.440\n after a certain number of tries.\n\n2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:56.340\n But now more fun is had when you just let people\n\n2:15:56.340 --> 2:15:58.040\n kind of keep trying when they're stuck\n\n2:15:58.040 --> 2:15:59.760\n rather than having to go all the way back\n\n2:15:59.760 --> 2:16:01.920\n and learn different things.\n\n2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:03.280\n So you've recommended the book,\n\n2:16:03.280 --> 2:16:05.760\n Game Engine Black Book Wolfenstein 3D\n\n2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:07.600\n for technical exploration of the game.\n\n2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:10.560\n So looking back 30 years,\n\n2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:13.260\n what are some memorable technical innovations\n\n2:16:13.260 --> 2:16:16.920\n that made this perspective shift into this world\n\n2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:20.160\n that's so immersive that scares you when a monster appears\n\n2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:22.260\n or some things you have to solve?\n\n2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:24.140\n So one of the interesting things\n\n2:16:24.140 --> 2:16:26.300\n that come back to the theme of deadlines\n\n2:16:26.300 --> 2:16:27.760\n and resource constraints,\n\n2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:30.040\n the game Catacombs 3D,\n\n2:16:31.120 --> 2:16:33.140\n we shipped, we were supposed to be shipping this\n\n2:16:33.140 --> 2:16:36.440\n for Gamers Edge on a monthly cadence and I had slipped.\n\n2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:37.840\n I was actually late.\n\n2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:39.240\n It slipped like six weeks\n\n2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:41.580\n because this was texture mapped walls\n\n2:16:41.580 --> 2:16:44.760\n doing stuff that I hadn't done before.\n\n2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:46.740\n And at the six week point,\n\n2:16:46.740 --> 2:16:48.980\n it was still kind of glitchy and buggy.\n\n2:16:48.980 --> 2:16:51.600\n There were things that I knew that if you had a wall\n\n2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:54.600\n that was like almost edge on, you could slide over to it\n\n2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:56.040\n and you could see some things freak out\n\n2:16:56.040 --> 2:16:57.640\n or vanish or not work.\n\n2:16:57.640 --> 2:16:59.920\n And I hated that,\n\n2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:01.500\n but I was up against the wall.\n\n2:17:01.500 --> 2:17:03.000\n We had to ship the game.\n\n2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:04.680\n It was still a lot of fun to play.\n\n2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:06.000\n It was novel, nobody had seen it.\n\n2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.040\n It gave you that startle reflex reaction.\n\n2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:11.040\n So it was worth shipping,\n\n2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:13.980\n but it had these things that I knew were kind of flaky\n\n2:17:13.980 --> 2:17:17.440\n and janky and not what I was really proud of.\n\n2:17:17.440 --> 2:17:20.720\n So one of the things that I did very differently\n\n2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:24.000\n in Wolfenstein was I went,\n\n2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:27.200\n Catacombs used almost a conventional thing\n\n2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:30.240\n where you had segments that were one dimensional polygons\n\n2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:33.080\n basically that were clipped and back faced\n\n2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:36.320\n and done kind of like a very crude 3D engine\n\n2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:37.340\n from the professionals,\n\n2:17:37.340 --> 2:17:39.500\n but I wasn't getting it done right.\n\n2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:41.520\n I was not doing a good enough job.\n\n2:17:41.520 --> 2:17:45.500\n I didn't really have line of sight to fix it right.\n\n2:17:45.500 --> 2:17:46.920\n There's stuff that of course I look back,\n\n2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:48.640\n it's like, oh, it's obvious how to do this\n\n2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:51.000\n and do the math right, do your clipping right,\n\n2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.240\n check all of this, how you handle the precision.\n\n2:17:53.240 --> 2:17:55.680\n But I did not know how to do that at that time.\n\n2:17:55.680 --> 2:17:59.000\n Was that the first 3D engine you wrote Catacombs 3D?\n\n2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:00.840\n Yeah, Hover Tank had been a little bit before that,\n\n2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:02.440\n but that had the flat shaded walls.\n\n2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:04.520\n So the texture mapping on the walls\n\n2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:06.840\n was what was bringing in some of these challenges\n\n2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:08.920\n that was hard for me\n\n2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:11.080\n and I couldn't solve it right at the time.\n\n2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:13.440\n Can you describe what flat shading is and texture mapping?\n\n2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:16.020\n So the walls were solid color,\n\n2:18:16.020 --> 2:18:19.280\n one of 16 colors in Hover Tank.\n\n2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:20.800\n So that's easy, it's fast,\n\n2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:23.640\n you just draw the solid color for everything.\n\n2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:25.560\n Texture mapping is what we all see today\n\n2:18:25.560 --> 2:18:28.060\n where you have an image that is stretched and distorted\n\n2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:31.000\n onto the walls or the surfaces that you're working with.\n\n2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:35.280\n And it was a long time for me to just figure out\n\n2:18:35.280 --> 2:18:38.520\n how to do that without it distorting in the wrong ways.\n\n2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:42.360\n And I did not get it all exactly right in Catacombs\n\n2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:44.840\n and I had these flaws.\n\n2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:46.740\n So that was important enough to me\n\n2:18:46.740 --> 2:18:49.360\n that rather than continuing to bang my head on that\n\n2:18:49.360 --> 2:18:51.800\n when I wasn't positive I was gonna get it,\n\n2:18:51.800 --> 2:18:53.440\n I went with a completely different approach\n\n2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:56.400\n for drawing for figuring out where the walls were\n\n2:18:56.400 --> 2:18:58.580\n which was a ray casting approach,\n\n2:18:58.580 --> 2:19:02.680\n which I had done in Catacombs 3D I had a bunch of C code\n\n2:19:02.680 --> 2:19:05.840\n trying to make this work right and it wasn't working right.\n\n2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:09.880\n In Wolfenstein I wound up going to a very small amount\n\n2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:11.160\n of assembly code.\n\n2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:14.360\n So in some ways there should be a slower way of doing it\n\n2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:16.520\n but by making it a smaller amount of work\n\n2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:19.280\n that I could more tightly optimize it worked out\n\n2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:22.780\n and Wolfenstein 3D was just absolutely rock solid.\n\n2:19:22.780 --> 2:19:25.480\n It was nothing glitched in there.\n\n2:19:25.480 --> 2:19:28.280\n The game just was pretty much flawless through all of that\n\n2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:29.840\n and I was super proud of that.\n\n2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:33.240\n But eventually like in the later games\n\n2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:35.640\n I went back to the more span based things\n\n2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:37.620\n where I could get more total efficiency\n\n2:19:37.620 --> 2:19:40.100\n once I really did figure out how to do it.\n\n2:19:40.100 --> 2:19:42.640\n So there were two sort of key technical things\n\n2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:45.840\n to Wolfenstein, one was this ray casting approach\n\n2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:48.780\n which you still to this day you see people go and say\n\n2:19:48.780 --> 2:19:50.480\n let's write a ray casting engine\n\n2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:53.140\n because it's an understandable way of doing things\n\n2:19:53.140 --> 2:19:55.700\n that lets you make games very much like that.\n\n2:19:55.700 --> 2:19:57.620\n So you see ray casters in JavaScript,\n\n2:19:57.620 --> 2:20:00.640\n ray casters in Python, people that are basically going\n\n2:20:00.640 --> 2:20:04.960\n and re implementing that approach to taking a tiled world\n\n2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:06.480\n and casting out into it.\n\n2:20:06.480 --> 2:20:08.760\n It works pretty well but it's not the fastest way\n\n2:20:08.760 --> 2:20:09.600\n of doing it.\n\n2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:11.380\n Can you describe what ray casting is?\n\n2:20:11.380 --> 2:20:13.420\n So you start off and you've got your screen\n\n2:20:13.420 --> 2:20:15.780\n which is 320 pixels across at the time\n\n2:20:15.780 --> 2:20:19.780\n if you haven't sized down the window for greater speed\n\n2:20:19.780 --> 2:20:22.480\n and at every pixel there's gonna be an angle\n\n2:20:22.480 --> 2:20:24.520\n from you've got your position in the world\n\n2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:26.920\n and you're going to just run along that angle\n\n2:20:26.920 --> 2:20:29.160\n and keep going until you hit a block.\n\n2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:32.040\n So up to 320 times across there\n\n2:20:32.040 --> 2:20:35.520\n it's gonna throw a cast array out into the world\n\n2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:38.660\n from wherever your origin is until it runs into a wall\n\n2:20:38.660 --> 2:20:42.140\n and then it can figure out exactly where on the wall it hits.\n\n2:20:42.140 --> 2:20:45.400\n The performance challenge of that is as it's going out\n\n2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:49.240\n every block it's crossing it checks is this a solid wall.\n\n2:20:49.240 --> 2:20:52.480\n So that means that in like the early Wolfenstein levels\n\n2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:55.880\n you're in a small jail cell going out into a small hallway\n\n2:20:55.880 --> 2:20:57.180\n it's super efficient for that\n\n2:20:57.180 --> 2:21:00.200\n because you're only stepping across three or four blocks\n\n2:21:00.200 --> 2:21:02.480\n but then if somebody makes a room that covers\n\n2:21:02.480 --> 2:21:05.520\n our maps were limited to 64 by 64 blocks.\n\n2:21:05.520 --> 2:21:08.700\n If you made one room that was nothing but walls\n\n2:21:08.700 --> 2:21:11.000\n at the far space it would go pretty slow\n\n2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:14.440\n because it would be stepping across 80 tile tests\n\n2:21:14.440 --> 2:21:15.880\n or something along the way.\n\n2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:17.480\n By the way the physics of our universe\n\n2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:19.000\n seems to be competing in this very thing.\n\n2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:23.080\n So this maps nicely to the actual physics of our world.\n\n2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:25.440\n Yeah you get like I follow a little bit of something\n\n2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:28.680\n like Steven Wolfram's work on interconnected\n\n2:21:28.680 --> 2:21:30.600\n network information states of that\n\n2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:34.560\n and that's it's beyond what I can have an informed opinion\n\n2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:37.680\n on but it's interesting that people are considering\n\n2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:41.600\n things like that and have things that can back it up.\n\n2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:44.200\n Yeah there's whole different sets\n\n2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:45.720\n of interesting stuff there.\n\n2:21:45.720 --> 2:21:48.200\n So Wolfenstein 3D had ray casting.\n\n2:21:48.200 --> 2:21:51.080\n Ray casting and then the other kind of key aspect\n\n2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:53.920\n was what I called compiled scalers\n\n2:21:53.920 --> 2:21:58.600\n where the idea of you'd saw this in the earlier\n\n2:21:58.600 --> 2:22:01.160\n classic arcade games like Space Harrier and stuff\n\n2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:04.240\n where you would take a picture which is normally drawn\n\n2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:06.840\n directly on the screen and then if you have the ability\n\n2:22:06.840 --> 2:22:09.360\n to make it bigger or smaller big chunky pixels\n\n2:22:09.360 --> 2:22:12.180\n or fizzly small drop sampled pixels.\n\n2:22:12.180 --> 2:22:15.080\n That's the fundamental aspect of what our characters\n\n2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:16.520\n were doing in these 3D games.\n\n2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:18.380\n You would have it's just like you might have drawn\n\n2:22:18.380 --> 2:22:20.200\n a tiny little character but now we can make them\n\n2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:23.220\n really big and make them really small and move it around.\n\n2:22:23.220 --> 2:22:26.480\n That was the limited kind of 3D that we had for characters.\n\n2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:27.960\n To make them turn there were literally\n\n2:22:27.960 --> 2:22:29.560\n eight different views of them.\n\n2:22:29.560 --> 2:22:31.800\n You didn't actually have a 3D model that would rotate.\n\n2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:33.780\n You just had these cardboard cutouts.\n\n2:22:33.780 --> 2:22:36.760\n But that was good enough for that startle fight reaction\n\n2:22:36.760 --> 2:22:40.080\n and it was kind of what we had to deal with there.\n\n2:22:40.080 --> 2:22:42.280\n So a straightforward approach to do that\n\n2:22:42.280 --> 2:22:44.600\n you could just write out your doubly nested loop\n\n2:22:44.600 --> 2:22:47.080\n of you've got your stretch factor\n\n2:22:47.080 --> 2:22:48.080\n and it's like you've got a point,\n\n2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:49.400\n you stretch by a little bit,\n\n2:22:49.400 --> 2:22:50.680\n it might be on the same pixel,\n\n2:22:50.680 --> 2:22:51.680\n it might be on the next pixel,\n\n2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:53.860\n it might have skipped a pixel.\n\n2:22:53.860 --> 2:22:56.080\n You can write that out but it's not gonna be fast enough\n\n2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:58.480\n where especially you get a character for that\n\n2:22:58.480 --> 2:23:00.480\n right in your face monster covering\n\n2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:02.200\n almost the entire screen.\n\n2:23:02.200 --> 2:23:05.080\n Doing that with a general purpose scaling routine\n\n2:23:05.080 --> 2:23:06.520\n would have just been much too slow.\n\n2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:08.320\n It would have worked when they're small characters\n\n2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:09.840\n but then it would get slower and slower\n\n2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:12.160\n as they got closer to you until right at the time\n\n2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:15.320\n when you most care about having a fast reaction time,\n\n2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:17.320\n the game would be chunking down.\n\n2:23:17.320 --> 2:23:22.320\n So the fastest possible way to draw pixels at that time\n\n2:23:22.400 --> 2:23:27.400\n was to, instead of saying I've got a general purpose\n\n2:23:28.720 --> 2:23:31.500\n version that can handle any scale,\n\n2:23:31.500 --> 2:23:35.320\n I used a program to make essentially\n\n2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:37.620\n a hundred or more separate little programs\n\n2:23:37.620 --> 2:23:40.200\n that was optimized for I will take an image\n\n2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:42.200\n and I will draw it 12 pixels tall.\n\n2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:44.680\n I'll take an image, I'll draw it 14 pixels tall\n\n2:23:44.680 --> 2:23:47.680\n up by every two pixels even for that.\n\n2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:50.280\n So you would have the most optimized code\n\n2:23:50.280 --> 2:23:52.040\n so that in the normal case\n\n2:23:52.040 --> 2:23:55.320\n where most of the world is fairly large,\n\n2:23:55.320 --> 2:23:57.000\n like the pixels are big,\n\n2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:58.640\n we did not have a lot of memory.\n\n2:23:58.640 --> 2:24:01.600\n So in most cases that meant that you would load\n\n2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:05.240\n a pixel color and then you would store it multiple times.\n\n2:24:05.240 --> 2:24:09.040\n So that was faster than even copying an image\n\n2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:10.720\n in a normal conventional case\n\n2:24:10.720 --> 2:24:13.240\n because most of the time the image is expanded.\n\n2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:16.600\n So instead of doing one read, one write for a simple copy,\n\n2:24:16.600 --> 2:24:19.120\n you might be doing one read and three or four writes\n\n2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:20.480\n as it got really big.\n\n2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:22.320\n And that had the beneficial aspect\n\n2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:24.360\n of just when you needed the performance most\n\n2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:25.980\n when things are covering the screen,\n\n2:24:25.980 --> 2:24:28.600\n it was giving you the most acceleration for that.\n\n2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:32.480\n By the way, were you able to understand this\n\n2:24:32.480 --> 2:24:34.720\n through thinking about it or were you testing\n\n2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:36.640\n like the right speed and like that?\n\n2:24:36.640 --> 2:24:40.160\n This again comes back to, I can find the antecedents\n\n2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:41.120\n for things like this.\n\n2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:45.400\n So back in the Apple II days,\n\n2:24:45.400 --> 2:24:49.560\n the graphics were essentially single bits at a time.\n\n2:24:49.560 --> 2:24:51.760\n And if you wanted to make your little spaceship,\n\n2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:54.880\n if you wanted to make it smoothly go across the world,\n\n2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:56.720\n if you just took the image and you drew it out\n\n2:24:56.720 --> 2:24:59.360\n at the next location, you would move by seven pixels\n\n2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:01.320\n at a time, so it'd go chunk, chunk, chunk.\n\n2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:03.240\n If you wanted to make it move smoothly,\n\n2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:05.880\n you actually had to make seven versions of the ship\n\n2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:07.360\n that were pre shifted.\n\n2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:09.920\n You could write a program that would shift it dynamically,\n\n2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:11.460\n but on a one megahertz processor,\n\n2:25:11.460 --> 2:25:13.180\n that's not going anywhere fast.\n\n2:25:13.180 --> 2:25:16.660\n So if you wanted to do a smooth moving fast action game,\n\n2:25:16.660 --> 2:25:20.440\n you made separate versions of each of these sprites.\n\n2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:22.360\n Now there were a few more tricks you could pull\n\n2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:24.480\n that if it still wasn't fast enough,\n\n2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:26.900\n you could make a compiled shape\n\n2:25:26.900 --> 2:25:31.200\n where instead of this program that normally copies an image\n\n2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:33.760\n and says like, get this byte from here, stored here,\n\n2:25:33.760 --> 2:25:35.400\n get this byte, store this byte.\n\n2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:38.440\n If you've got the memory space, you could say,\n\n2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:39.800\n I'm going to write the program\n\n2:25:39.800 --> 2:25:41.960\n that does nothing but draw this shape.\n\n2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:43.100\n It's going to be like,\n\n2:25:43.100 --> 2:25:46.640\n I'm going to load the immediate value 25,\n\n2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:47.920\n which is some bit pattern,\n\n2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:51.340\n and then I'm going to store that at this location.\n\n2:25:51.340 --> 2:25:53.280\n Rather than loading something from memory\n\n2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:56.880\n that involved indexing registers and this other slow stuff,\n\n2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:57.720\n you could go ahead and say,\n\n2:25:57.720 --> 2:26:00.020\n no, I'm gonna hard code the exact values\n\n2:26:00.020 --> 2:26:02.460\n of all of the image right into the program.\n\n2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:04.120\n And this was always a horrible trade off there,\n\n2:26:04.120 --> 2:26:05.360\n which you didn't have much memory\n\n2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:07.000\n and you didn't have much speed.\n\n2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.600\n But if you had something that you wanted to go really fast,\n\n2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:11.800\n you could turn it into a program.\n\n2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:14.560\n And that was, knowing about that technique\n\n2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:17.640\n is what made me think about some of these unwinding it\n\n2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:19.760\n for the PC where people that didn't come\n\n2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:23.360\n from that background were less likely to think about that.\n\n2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:25.200\n I mean, there's some deep parallels\n\n2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:27.500\n probably to human cognition as well.\n\n2:26:27.500 --> 2:26:34.560\n There's something about optimizing and compressing\n\n2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:36.800\n the processing of a new information\n\n2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:39.760\n that requires you to predict the possible ways\n\n2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:44.440\n in which the game or the world might unroll.\n\n2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:47.440\n And you have something like compiled scaler is always there.\n\n2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:51.400\n So you have like, like you have a prediction\n\n2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:52.720\n of how the world will unroll\n\n2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:57.060\n and you have some kind of optimized data structure\n\n2:26:57.060 --> 2:26:58.200\n for that prediction.\n\n2:26:58.200 --> 2:27:00.440\n And then you can modify if the world turns out\n\n2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:02.320\n to be different, you can modify a slight way.\n\n2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:04.180\n And as far as building out techniques,\n\n2:27:04.180 --> 2:27:06.960\n so much of the brain is about the associative context.\n\n2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:09.120\n You know, they're just, when you learn something,\n\n2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:10.920\n it's in the context of something else\n\n2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:13.980\n and you can have faint, tiny little hints of things.\n\n2:27:13.980 --> 2:27:16.440\n And I do think there are some deep things\n\n2:27:16.440 --> 2:27:18.840\n around like sparse distributed memories and boosting.\n\n2:27:18.840 --> 2:27:20.420\n That's like, if you can just be slightly\n\n2:27:20.420 --> 2:27:23.360\n above the noise floor of having some hint of something,\n\n2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:26.460\n you can have things refined into pulling the memory back up.\n\n2:27:26.460 --> 2:27:29.560\n So having a, being a programmer and having a toolbox\n\n2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:31.200\n of like all of these things that,\n\n2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:33.640\n things that I did in all of these previous lives\n\n2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:36.080\n of programming tasks that still matters to me\n\n2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:38.520\n about how I'm able to pull up some of these things.\n\n2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:41.180\n Like in that case, it was something I did on the Apple 2\n\n2:27:41.180 --> 2:27:43.240\n then being relevant for the PC.\n\n2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:46.040\n And I have still cases when I would,\n\n2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:48.000\n when I would work on mobile development then be like,\n\n2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:51.720\n okay, I did something like this back in the doom days,\n\n2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:53.600\n but now it's a different environment,\n\n2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:55.000\n but I have still had that tie.\n\n2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:56.880\n I can bring it in and I can transform it\n\n2:27:56.880 --> 2:27:59.120\n into what the world needs right now.\n\n2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:01.920\n And I do think that's actually one of the very core things\n\n2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:04.680\n with human cognition and brain like,\n\n2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:06.080\n you know, brain like functioning\n\n2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:08.480\n is finding these ways about you've got,\n\n2:28:08.480 --> 2:28:10.800\n your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once.\n\n2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:13.080\n You know, it's, it is just a set of all of this stuff\n\n2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:16.440\n that is just fetched back by these queries that go into it.\n\n2:28:16.440 --> 2:28:18.900\n And they can just be slightly above the noise floor\n\n2:28:18.900 --> 2:28:21.260\n with a random noise in your neurons and synapses\n\n2:28:21.260 --> 2:28:23.980\n that are affecting exactly what gets pulled up.\n\n2:28:23.980 --> 2:28:26.520\n So you're saying some of these very specific solutions\n\n2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:28.600\n for different games,\n\n2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:31.960\n you find that there's a kernel of a deep idea\n\n2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:34.760\n that's generalizable to other, to other things.\n\n2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:36.480\n Yeah, you can't predict what it's going to be,\n\n2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:37.720\n but that idea of like,\n\n2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:40.720\n I called out that compiled shaders in the forward\n\n2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:43.320\n that I wrote for that, the game engine black book,\n\n2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:44.920\n as you know, this is,\n\n2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:48.000\n it's kind of an end point of unrolling code,\n\n2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.400\n but that's one of those things that thinking about that\n\n2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:51.640\n and having that in your mind.\n\n2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:53.120\n And I'm sure there are some programmers\n\n2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:54.680\n that, you know, hear about that.\n\n2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:55.560\n Think about it a little bit.\n\n2:28:55.560 --> 2:28:57.040\n It's kind of the mind blown moment.\n\n2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:00.760\n It's like, oh, you can just turn all of that data into code.\n\n2:29:00.760 --> 2:29:03.360\n And nowadays, you know, you have instruction cache issues\n\n2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:05.540\n and that's not necessarily the best idea,\n\n2:29:05.540 --> 2:29:07.280\n but there are different,\n\n2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:09.020\n it's an idea that has power\n\n2:29:09.020 --> 2:29:11.500\n and has probably relevance in some other areas.\n\n2:29:11.500 --> 2:29:13.020\n Maybe it's in a hardware point of view\n\n2:29:13.020 --> 2:29:15.460\n that there's a way you approach building hardware\n\n2:29:15.460 --> 2:29:16.800\n that has that same,\n\n2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:18.440\n you don't even have to think about iterating.\n\n2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:22.200\n You just bake everything all the way into it in one place.\n\n2:29:22.200 --> 2:29:25.400\n What is the story of how you came to program Doom?\n\n2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:27.760\n What are some memorable technical challenges\n\n2:29:27.760 --> 2:29:29.800\n or innovations within that game?\n\n2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:33.640\n So the path that we went after Wolfenstein got out\n\n2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:35.560\n and we were on this crazy arc\n\n2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:38.840\n where Keen one through three, more success than we thought,\n\n2:29:38.840 --> 2:29:41.120\n Keen four through six, even more success,\n\n2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:42.880\n Wolfenstein even more success.\n\n2:29:42.880 --> 2:29:46.420\n So we were on this crazy trajectory for things.\n\n2:29:46.420 --> 2:29:48.280\n So actually our first box commercial project\n\n2:29:48.280 --> 2:29:50.660\n was the Commander Keen game,\n\n2:29:50.660 --> 2:29:52.960\n but then Wolfenstein was going to have a game called\n\n2:29:52.960 --> 2:29:55.940\n Spear of Destiny, which was a commercial version,\n\n2:29:55.940 --> 2:29:57.260\n 60 new levels.\n\n2:29:57.260 --> 2:29:59.480\n So the rest of the team took the game engine\n\n2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:02.740\n pretty much as it was and started working on that.\n\n2:30:02.740 --> 2:30:03.920\n We got new monsters,\n\n2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:07.640\n but it's basically reskins of the things there.\n\n2:30:07.640 --> 2:30:09.420\n And there's a really interesting aspect about that\n\n2:30:09.420 --> 2:30:12.260\n that I didn't appreciate until much, much later\n\n2:30:12.260 --> 2:30:16.640\n about how Wolfenstein clearly did tap out its limit\n\n2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:18.840\n about what you want to play,\n\n2:30:18.840 --> 2:30:21.600\n all the levels and a couple of our license things.\n\n2:30:21.600 --> 2:30:24.000\n There was a hard creative wall\n\n2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:25.800\n that you did not really benefit much\n\n2:30:25.800 --> 2:30:27.880\n by continuing to beat on it.\n\n2:30:27.880 --> 2:30:31.440\n But a game like Doom and other more modern games\n\n2:30:31.440 --> 2:30:33.000\n like Minecraft or something,\n\n2:30:33.000 --> 2:30:35.040\n there's kind of a Turing completeness level\n\n2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:37.200\n of design freedom that you get in games\n\n2:30:37.200 --> 2:30:40.400\n that Wolfenstein clearly sat on one side of.\n\n2:30:40.400 --> 2:30:42.040\n All the creative people in the world\n\n2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:43.980\n could not go and do a masterpiece\n\n2:30:43.980 --> 2:30:46.480\n just with the technology that Wolfenstein had.\n\n2:30:46.480 --> 2:30:48.160\n Wolfenstein could do Wolfenstein,\n\n2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:50.760\n but you really couldn't do something crazy and different.\n\n2:30:50.760 --> 2:30:53.380\n But it didn't take that much more capability\n\n2:30:53.380 --> 2:30:56.240\n to get to Wolfenstein with the freeform lines\n\n2:30:56.240 --> 2:30:58.600\n and a little bit more artistic freedom\n\n2:30:58.600 --> 2:31:00.960\n to get to the point where people still announce\n\n2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:03.720\n new Doom levels today, all these years after\n\n2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:06.720\n without having completely tapped out the creativity.\n\n2:31:06.720 --> 2:31:07.560\n How did you put it?\n\n2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:08.520\n Turing complete?\n\n2:31:08.520 --> 2:31:10.200\n Yeah, Turing complete design space.\n\n2:31:10.200 --> 2:31:11.040\n Design space.\n\n2:31:11.040 --> 2:31:11.880\n Where it's like, you know,\n\n2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:14.800\n we have the kind of computational universality\n\n2:31:14.800 --> 2:31:16.120\n on a lot of things and how different\n\n2:31:16.120 --> 2:31:17.480\n subsurface work. For creativity.\n\n2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:20.960\n But yeah, there's things where a box can be too small,\n\n2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:22.840\n but above a certain point,\n\n2:31:22.840 --> 2:31:26.200\n you kind of are at the point where you really have\n\n2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:28.400\n almost unbounded creative ability there.\n\n2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:31.440\n And Doom was the first time you crossed that line.\n\n2:31:31.440 --> 2:31:35.100\n Yeah, where there were thousands of Doom levels created,\n\n2:31:35.100 --> 2:31:37.320\n and some of them still have something new and interesting\n\n2:31:37.320 --> 2:31:38.600\n to say to the world about it.\n\n2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:43.220\n Is that line, can you introspect what that line was?\n\n2:31:43.220 --> 2:31:44.840\n Is it in the design space?\n\n2:31:44.840 --> 2:31:48.380\n Is it something about the programming capabilities\n\n2:31:48.380 --> 2:31:50.920\n that you were able to add to the game?\n\n2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:54.380\n So the graphics fidelity was a necessary part\n\n2:31:54.380 --> 2:31:57.520\n because the block limitations in Wolfenstein,\n\n2:31:57.520 --> 2:32:00.800\n what we had right there was not enough.\n\n2:32:00.800 --> 2:32:04.680\n The full scale blocks, although Minecraft really did show\n\n2:32:04.680 --> 2:32:07.760\n that perhaps blocks stacked in 3D\n\n2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:09.920\n and at one quarter of the scale of that,\n\n2:32:09.920 --> 2:32:11.360\n or one eighth in volume,\n\n2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:13.260\n is then sufficient to have all of that.\n\n2:32:13.260 --> 2:32:16.760\n But the wall sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein\n\n2:32:16.760 --> 2:32:18.720\n was too much of a creative limitation.\n\n2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:21.640\n We licensed the technology to a few other teams.\n\n2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:24.880\n None of them made too much of a dent with that.\n\n2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:27.240\n It just wasn't enough creative ability.\n\n2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:28.480\n But a little bit more,\n\n2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:31.000\n whether it was the variable floors and ceilings\n\n2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.200\n and arbitrary angles in Doom,\n\n2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:37.200\n or the smaller voxel blocks in Minecraft,\n\n2:32:37.200 --> 2:32:38.640\n is then enough to open it up\n\n2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:41.880\n to just worlds and worlds of new capabilities.\n\n2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:45.040\n What is binary space partitioning?\n\n2:32:45.040 --> 2:32:47.600\n So the. Which is one of the technologies.\n\n2:32:47.600 --> 2:32:51.080\n Yeah, so jump around a little bit on the story path there.\n\n2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:53.160\n So while the team was working on Spirit Destiny\n\n2:32:53.160 --> 2:32:57.200\n for Wolfenstein, we had met another development team,\n\n2:32:57.200 --> 2:32:59.960\n Raven Software, while we were in Wisconsin.\n\n2:32:59.960 --> 2:33:03.280\n And they were doing, they had RPG background\n\n2:33:03.280 --> 2:33:04.760\n and I still kind of loved that.\n\n2:33:04.760 --> 2:33:07.720\n And I offered to do a game engine for them\n\n2:33:07.720 --> 2:33:10.720\n to let them do a 3D rendered RPG\n\n2:33:10.720 --> 2:33:14.060\n instead of the, like most RPG games were kind of hand drawn.\n\n2:33:14.060 --> 2:33:15.540\n They made it look kind of 3D,\n\n2:33:15.540 --> 2:33:17.560\n but it was done just all with artist work\n\n2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:19.800\n rather than a real engine.\n\n2:33:19.800 --> 2:33:23.320\n And after Wolfenstein, this was still a tile based world,\n\n2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:25.600\n but I added floors and ceilings and some lighting\n\n2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:27.680\n and the ability to have some sloped floors\n\n2:33:27.680 --> 2:33:28.520\n in different areas.\n\n2:33:28.520 --> 2:33:30.040\n And that was my intermediate step\n\n2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:32.360\n for a game called Shadowcaster.\n\n2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.440\n And it had slowed down enough.\n\n2:33:34.440 --> 2:33:37.680\n It was not fast enough to do our type of action things.\n\n2:33:37.680 --> 2:33:39.960\n So they had the screen crop down a little bit.\n\n2:33:39.960 --> 2:33:42.280\n So you couldn't go the full screen width\n\n2:33:42.280 --> 2:33:46.320\n like we would try to do in Wolfenstein, but I learned a lot.\n\n2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:47.960\n I got the floors and ceilings and lightings\n\n2:33:47.960 --> 2:33:48.880\n and it looked great.\n\n2:33:48.880 --> 2:33:50.360\n They were great artists up there.\n\n2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.320\n And it was an inspiration for us\n\n2:33:52.320 --> 2:33:54.400\n to look at some of that stuff.\n\n2:33:54.400 --> 2:33:57.000\n But I had learned enough from that,\n\n2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:58.480\n that I had the plan for,\n\n2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:01.540\n I knew faster ways to do the lighting and shadowing.\n\n2:34:01.540 --> 2:34:03.640\n And I wanted to do this free form geometry.\n\n2:34:03.640 --> 2:34:06.560\n I wanted to break out of this tile based\n\n2:34:06.560 --> 2:34:09.120\n 90 degree world limitations.\n\n2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:12.280\n So we had, that was when we got our next stations\n\n2:34:12.280 --> 2:34:14.960\n and we were working with these higher powered systems.\n\n2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:18.400\n And we built an editor that let us draw\n\n2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:20.240\n kind of arbitrary line segments.\n\n2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:22.720\n And I was working hard to try to make something\n\n2:34:22.720 --> 2:34:24.820\n that could render this fast enough.\n\n2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:28.760\n I was pushing myself pretty hard.\n\n2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:32.220\n And we were at a point where we could see some things\n\n2:34:32.220 --> 2:34:33.720\n that looked amazingly cool,\n\n2:34:33.720 --> 2:34:37.760\n but it wasn't really fast enough for the way I was doing it.\n\n2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:39.440\n For this flexibility, it was no longer,\n\n2:34:39.440 --> 2:34:41.080\n I couldn't just ray cast into it.\n\n2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:43.240\n And I had these very complex sets of lines\n\n2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:45.360\n and simple little worlds were okay.\n\n2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:47.520\n But the cool things that we wanted to do\n\n2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:49.680\n just weren't quite fast enough.\n\n2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:52.480\n And I wound up taking a break at that point.\n\n2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:54.520\n And I did the port.\n\n2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:58.000\n I did two ports of our games,\n\n2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:01.040\n Wolfenstein to the Super Nintendo.\n\n2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:04.240\n It was a crazy difficult thing to do,\n\n2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:06.040\n which was an even slower processors,\n\n2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:10.000\n like a couple of megahertz processor.\n\n2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:11.820\n And it had been this whole thing\n\n2:35:11.820 --> 2:35:16.820\n where we had farmed out the work and it wasn't going well.\n\n2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:18.860\n And I took it back over\n\n2:35:18.860 --> 2:35:21.860\n and trying to make it go fast on there\n\n2:35:21.860 --> 2:35:25.160\n where it really did not have much processing power.\n\n2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:26.880\n The pixels were stretched up hugely\n\n2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:29.040\n and it was pretty ugly when you looked at it.\n\n2:35:29.040 --> 2:35:31.520\n But in the end, it did come out fast enough to play\n\n2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:33.480\n and still be kind of fun from that.\n\n2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:36.600\n But that was where I started using BSP trees\n\n2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:38.320\n or binary space partitioning trees.\n\n2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:41.520\n It was one of those things I had to make it faster there.\n\n2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:44.520\n It was a stepping stone where it was reasonably easy\n\n2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:46.960\n to understand in the grid world of Wolfenstein\n\n2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:49.960\n where it was all still 90 degree angles.\n\n2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:53.920\n BSP trees were, I eased myself into it with that.\n\n2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:56.200\n And it was a big success.\n\n2:35:56.200 --> 2:35:58.740\n Then when I came back to working on Doom,\n\n2:35:58.740 --> 2:36:00.640\n I had this new tool in my toolbox.\n\n2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:02.040\n It was gonna be a lot harder\n\n2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:03.900\n with the arbitrary angles of Doom.\n\n2:36:03.900 --> 2:36:06.120\n This was where I really started grappling\n\n2:36:06.120 --> 2:36:07.760\n with epsilon problems.\n\n2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:09.600\n And just up until that point,\n\n2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:11.360\n I hadn't really had to deal with the fact\n\n2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:13.820\n that I am so many numeric things.\n\n2:36:13.820 --> 2:36:15.340\n This almost felt like a betrayal to me\n\n2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:17.600\n where people had told me that I had mathematicians\n\n2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:20.360\n up on a bit of a pedestal where I was,\n\n2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:22.680\n people think I'm a math wizard and I'm not.\n\n2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:25.980\n I really, everything that I did was really done\n\n2:36:25.980 --> 2:36:29.520\n with a solid high school math understanding.\n\n2:36:29.520 --> 2:36:33.480\n Algebra two trigonometry and that was what got me\n\n2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:35.500\n all the way through Doom and Quake and all of that,\n\n2:36:35.500 --> 2:36:38.280\n of just understanding basics of matrices\n\n2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:41.040\n and knowing it well enough to do something with it.\n\n2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:42.920\n What's the epsilon problems you ran into?\n\n2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:46.720\n So when you wind up taking like a sloped line\n\n2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:48.340\n and you say, I'm going to intersect it\n\n2:36:48.340 --> 2:36:49.880\n with another sloped line,\n\n2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:52.200\n then you wind up with something\n\n2:36:52.200 --> 2:36:54.960\n that's not going to be on these nice grid boundaries.\n\n2:36:54.960 --> 2:36:57.120\n With the Wolfenstein tile maps,\n\n2:36:57.120 --> 2:36:58.960\n all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines\n\n2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:00.200\n looking at it from above.\n\n2:37:00.200 --> 2:37:02.200\n And if you cut one of them, it's just obvious\n\n2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:04.880\n the other one gets cut exactly at that point.\n\n2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:06.620\n But when you have angled lines,\n\n2:37:06.620 --> 2:37:08.840\n you're doing a kind of a slope intercept problem\n\n2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:11.200\n and you wind up with rational numbers there\n\n2:37:11.200 --> 2:37:14.800\n where things that are not going to evenly land on an integer\n\n2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:17.240\n or even on any fixed point value that you've got.\n\n2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:19.520\n So everything winds up having to snap\n\n2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:20.960\n to some fixed point value.\n\n2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:23.400\n So the lines slightly change their angle.\n\n2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:25.320\n You wind up, if you cut something here,\n\n2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:26.840\n this one's going to bend a little this way\n\n2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:28.900\n and it's not going to be completely straight.\n\n2:37:28.900 --> 2:37:30.720\n And then you come down to all these questions of,\n\n2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:35.140\n well, this one is a point on an angled line.\n\n2:37:35.140 --> 2:37:38.000\n You can't answer that in finite precision\n\n2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:41.000\n unless you're doing something with actual rational numbers.\n\n2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.220\n And later on, I did waste far too much time\n\n2:37:43.220 --> 2:37:44.180\n chasing things like that.\n\n2:37:44.180 --> 2:37:46.860\n How do you do precise arithmetic with rational numbers?\n\n2:37:46.860 --> 2:37:49.940\n And it always blows up eventually, exponentially\n\n2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:50.780\n as you do it.\n\n2:37:50.780 --> 2:37:53.240\n So these kinds of things are impossible with computers.\n\n2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:55.180\n So they're possible.\n\n2:37:55.180 --> 2:37:57.460\n Again, there are paths to doing it,\n\n2:37:57.460 --> 2:37:59.240\n but you can't fit them conveniently\n\n2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:00.240\n in any of the numbers.\n\n2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:01.800\n You need to start using big nums\n\n2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:04.600\n and different factor trackings of different things.\n\n2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:08.120\n So you have to, if you have any elements of OCD\n\n2:38:08.120 --> 2:38:09.840\n and you want to do something perfectly,\n\n2:38:09.840 --> 2:38:12.280\n you're screwed if you're working with floating point.\n\n2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:13.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:15.320\n So you had to deal with this for the first time.\n\n2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:18.400\n And there were lots of challenges there about like,\n\n2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:20.080\n okay, they build this cool thing.\n\n2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:22.880\n And the way the BSP trees work is it basically\n\n2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:26.400\n takes the walls and it carves other walls by those walls\n\n2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:28.760\n in this clever way that you can then\n\n2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:30.440\n take all of these fragments.\n\n2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:33.120\n And then you can for sure, from any given point,\n\n2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:35.160\n get an ordering of everything in the world.\n\n2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:36.800\n And you can say, this goes in front of this,\n\n2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:40.200\n goes in front of this, all the way back to the last thing.\n\n2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:42.400\n And that's super valuable for graphics\n\n2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:45.280\n where kind of a classic graphics algorithm\n\n2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:46.800\n would be painter's algorithm.\n\n2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:48.200\n You paint the furthest thing first,\n\n2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:49.880\n and then the next thing, and then the next thing,\n\n2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:52.760\n and then it comes up and it's all perfect for you.\n\n2:38:52.760 --> 2:38:54.840\n That's slow because you don't want to have to have drawn\n\n2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:56.160\n everything like that,\n\n2:38:56.160 --> 2:38:57.580\n but you can also flip it around\n\n2:38:57.580 --> 2:38:59.680\n and draw the closest thing to you.\n\n2:38:59.680 --> 2:39:01.400\n And then if you're clever about it,\n\n2:39:01.400 --> 2:39:03.520\n you can figure out what you need to draw\n\n2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:05.480\n that's visible beyond that.\n\n2:39:05.480 --> 2:39:07.560\n And that's what BSP trees allow you to do.\n\n2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:10.620\n Yeah, so it's combined with a bunch of other things,\n\n2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:12.200\n but it gives you that ordering.\n\n2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:13.760\n It's a clever way of doing things.\n\n2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:15.520\n And I remember I had learned this\n\n2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:18.760\n from one of my graphics Bible at the time,\n\n2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:20.480\n a book called Foley and Van Damme.\n\n2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:22.200\n And again, it was a different world back there.\n\n2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:24.660\n There was a small integer number of books.\n\n2:39:24.660 --> 2:39:29.660\n And this book that was big fat college textbook\n\n2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:32.520\n that I had read through many times.\n\n2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:34.240\n I didn't understand everything in it.\n\n2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:35.840\n Some of it wasn't useful to me,\n\n2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:39.620\n but they had the little thing about finite orderings\n\n2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:41.520\n of you draw a little T shaped thing\n\n2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:44.760\n and you can say you can make a fixed ahead of time order\n\n2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:48.240\n from this and you can generalize this with the BSP trees.\n\n2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:50.820\n And I got a little bit more information about that.\n\n2:39:50.820 --> 2:39:53.120\n And it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake,\n\n2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:54.760\n I got to meet Bruce Naylor,\n\n2:39:54.760 --> 2:39:56.520\n who is one of the original researchers\n\n2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:00.840\n that developed those technologies for academic literature.\n\n2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:01.740\n And that was kind of fun,\n\n2:40:01.740 --> 2:40:03.800\n but I was very much just finding a tool\n\n2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:05.840\n that can help me solve what I was doing.\n\n2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:07.800\n And I was using it in this very crude way\n\n2:40:07.800 --> 2:40:10.480\n in a two dimensional fashion, rather than the general 3D.\n\n2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:12.040\n The Epsilon problems got much worse\n\n2:40:12.040 --> 2:40:13.760\n in Quake and three dimensionals\n\n2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:15.680\n when things angle in every way.\n\n2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:18.360\n But eventually I did sort out\n\n2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:20.000\n how to do it reliably on Doom.\n\n2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:22.200\n There were still a few edge cases in Doom\n\n2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:24.360\n that were not absolutely perfect\n\n2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:27.740\n where they even got terminologies in the communities.\n\n2:40:27.740 --> 2:40:29.440\n Like when you got to something where it was messed up,\n\n2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:30.920\n it was a hall of mirrors effect\n\n2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:33.720\n because you'd sweep by and it wouldn't draw something there.\n\n2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:36.200\n And you would just wind up with the leftover remnants\n\n2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:39.260\n as you flipped between the two pages.\n\n2:40:39.260 --> 2:40:41.480\n But BSP trees were important for it.\n\n2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:45.640\n But it's again worth noting that after we did Doom,\n\n2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:49.000\n our major competition came from Ken Silverman\n\n2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.780\n and his build engine, which was used for Duke Nukem 3D\n\n2:40:51.780 --> 2:40:54.080\n and some of the other games for 3D Realms.\n\n2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:56.200\n And he used a completely different technology,\n\n2:40:56.200 --> 2:40:59.200\n nothing to do with BSP trees.\n\n2:40:59.200 --> 2:41:03.880\n So there's not just a one true way of doing things.\n\n2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:05.600\n There were critical things about\n\n2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:07.160\n to make any of those games fast.\n\n2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:09.640\n You had to separate your drawing into,\n\n2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:12.440\n you drew vertical lines and you drew horizontal lines,\n\n2:41:12.440 --> 2:41:14.320\n just kind of changing exactly\n\n2:41:14.320 --> 2:41:15.760\n what you would draw with them.\n\n2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:19.360\n That was critical for the technologies at that time.\n\n2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:21.680\n And like all the games that were kind of like that\n\n2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:23.400\n wound up doing something similar,\n\n2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:25.400\n but there were still a bunch of other decisions\n\n2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:26.800\n that could be made.\n\n2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:30.360\n And we made good enough decisions on everything on Doom.\n\n2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:33.680\n We brought in multiplayer significantly\n\n2:41:33.680 --> 2:41:35.640\n and it was our first game that was designed\n\n2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:37.640\n to be modified by the user community\n\n2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:41.120\n where we had this whole setup of our WAD files and PWADs\n\n2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:43.680\n and things that people could build with tools\n\n2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:44.680\n that we released to them.\n\n2:41:44.680 --> 2:41:46.220\n And they eventually rewrote to be better\n\n2:41:46.220 --> 2:41:48.840\n than what we released, but they could build things\n\n2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:50.400\n and you could add it to your game\n\n2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:52.260\n without destructively modifying it,\n\n2:41:52.260 --> 2:41:54.080\n which is what you had to do in all the early games.\n\n2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:57.600\n You literally hacked the data files or the executable\n\n2:41:57.600 --> 2:42:00.580\n before while Doom was set up in this flexible way\n\n2:42:00.580 --> 2:42:02.300\n so that you could just say,\n\n2:42:02.300 --> 2:42:04.820\n run the normal game with this added on on top\n\n2:42:04.820 --> 2:42:06.920\n and it would overlay just the things\n\n2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:09.100\n that you wanted to there.\n\n2:42:09.100 --> 2:42:11.580\n Would you say that Doom was kind of the first\n\n2:42:11.580 --> 2:42:14.240\n true 3D game that you created?\n\n2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:16.620\n So no, it's still, Doom would usually be called\n\n2:42:16.620 --> 2:42:17.800\n a two and a half D game\n\n2:42:17.800 --> 2:42:20.300\n where it had three dimensional points on it.\n\n2:42:20.300 --> 2:42:22.440\n And this is another one of these kind of pedantic things\n\n2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:23.980\n that people love to argue about,\n\n2:42:23.980 --> 2:42:25.720\n about what was the first 3D game.\n\n2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:29.360\n I still, like every month probably I hear from somebody\n\n2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:32.320\n about, well, was Doom really a 3D game or something?\n\n2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:38.520\n And I give the point where characters had three coordinates.\n\n2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:40.240\n So you had like an X, Y and Z,\n\n2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:42.300\n the cacodamon could be coming in very high\n\n2:42:42.300 --> 2:42:45.000\n and come down towards you.\n\n2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.400\n The walls had three coordinates on them.\n\n2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:50.320\n So on some sense it's a 3D game engine,\n\n2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:53.440\n but it was not a fully general 3D game engine.\n\n2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:56.660\n You could not build a pyramid in Doom\n\n2:42:56.660 --> 2:42:59.420\n because you couldn't make a sloped wall,\n\n2:42:59.420 --> 2:43:00.480\n which was slightly different\n\n2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:02.280\n where in that previous shadow caster game,\n\n2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:05.200\n I could have vertexes and have a sloped floor there,\n\n2:43:05.200 --> 2:43:08.320\n but the changes that I made for Doom to get higher speed\n\n2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:11.660\n and a different set of flexibility traded away that ability,\n\n2:43:11.660 --> 2:43:13.400\n but you literally couldn't make that.\n\n2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:17.880\n You could not, you could make different heights of passages,\n\n2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:20.280\n but you could not make a bridge over another area.\n\n2:43:20.280 --> 2:43:21.880\n You could not go over and above it.\n\n2:43:21.880 --> 2:43:24.880\n So it still had some 2D limitations to it.\n\n2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:26.020\n That's more about the building\n\n2:43:26.020 --> 2:43:27.480\n versus the actual experience.\n\n2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:29.120\n Cause the experience is.\n\n2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:30.520\n It felt like things would come at you,\n\n2:43:30.520 --> 2:43:32.440\n but again, you couldn't look up either.\n\n2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:34.720\n I am, you know, you could only pitch.\n\n2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:36.460\n It was four degrees of freedom\n\n2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:38.400\n rather than six degrees of freedom.\n\n2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:40.600\n You did not have the ability to tilt your head this way\n\n2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:42.320\n or pitch up and down.\n\n2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:44.480\n So that takes us to Quake.\n\n2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:47.480\n What was the leap there?\n\n2:43:47.480 --> 2:43:50.040\n What was some fascinating technical challenges\n\n2:43:50.040 --> 2:43:52.180\n and there were a lot or not challenges,\n\n2:43:52.180 --> 2:43:54.140\n but innovations that you've come up with.\n\n2:43:54.140 --> 2:43:56.440\n So Quake was kind of the first thing\n\n2:43:56.440 --> 2:43:59.520\n where I did have to kind of come face to face\n\n2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:01.240\n with my limitations,\n\n2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:02.280\n where it was the first thing\n\n2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:05.660\n where I really did kind of give it my all\n\n2:44:05.660 --> 2:44:08.400\n and still come up, you know, come up a little bit short\n\n2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:11.920\n in terms of what and when I wanted to get it done.\n\n2:44:11.920 --> 2:44:13.560\n And the company ran,\n\n2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:16.760\n they had some serious stresses through the whole project\n\n2:44:16.760 --> 2:44:19.680\n and we bit off a lot.\n\n2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:21.440\n So the things that we set out to do\n\n2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:24.640\n was it was going to be really a true 3D engine\n\n2:44:24.640 --> 2:44:26.960\n where it could do six degree of freedom.\n\n2:44:26.960 --> 2:44:29.680\n You could have all the viewpoints.\n\n2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:31.480\n You could model anything.\n\n2:44:31.480 --> 2:44:35.280\n It had a really remarkable new lighting model\n\n2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:37.080\n with the surface caching and things.\n\n2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:38.480\n That was one of those where it was starting\n\n2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:40.740\n to do some things that they weren't doing\n\n2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:43.600\n even on the very high end systems.\n\n2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:46.920\n And it was going to be completely programmable\n\n2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:48.200\n in the modding standpoint,\n\n2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:49.800\n where the thing that you couldn't do in Doom,\n\n2:44:49.800 --> 2:44:52.360\n you could replace almost all of the media,\n\n2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:55.120\n but you couldn't really change the game.\n\n2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:57.100\n There were still some people that were doing\n\n2:44:57.100 --> 2:44:58.800\n the hex setting of the executable,\n\n2:44:58.800 --> 2:45:00.620\n the dehacked things where you could change\n\n2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:01.900\n a few things about rules\n\n2:45:01.900 --> 2:45:04.620\n and people made some early capture the flag type things\n\n2:45:04.620 --> 2:45:06.020\n by hacking the executable,\n\n2:45:06.020 --> 2:45:08.520\n but it wasn't really set out to do that.\n\n2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:11.360\n Quake was going to have its own programming language\n\n2:45:11.360 --> 2:45:13.200\n that the game was going to be implemented in it.\n\n2:45:13.200 --> 2:45:14.840\n And that would be able to be overwritten\n\n2:45:14.840 --> 2:45:16.560\n just like any of the media.\n\n2:45:16.560 --> 2:45:18.400\n Code was going to be data for that.\n\n2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:21.000\n And you would be able to have expansion packs\n\n2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:24.160\n that changed fundamental things and mods and so on.\n\n2:45:24.160 --> 2:45:27.120\n And the multiplayer was going to be playable\n\n2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:28.120\n over the internet.\n\n2:45:28.120 --> 2:45:30.880\n It was going to support a client server\n\n2:45:30.880 --> 2:45:32.400\n rather than peer to peer.\n\n2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:34.160\n So we had the possibility of supporting\n\n2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:37.440\n larger numbers of players in disparate locations\n\n2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:41.320\n with this full flexibility of the programming overrides\n\n2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:44.920\n with full six degree of freedom modeling and viewing.\n\n2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:47.960\n And with this fancy new light mapped\n\n2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:49.720\n kind of surface caching side.\n\n2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:50.640\n It was a lot.\n\n2:45:50.640 --> 2:45:52.520\n And this was one of those things that\n\n2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:56.000\n if I could go back and tell younger me\n\n2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:57.500\n to do something differently,\n\n2:45:57.500 --> 2:45:59.680\n it would have been to split those innovations up\n\n2:45:59.680 --> 2:46:02.000\n into two phases in two separate games.\n\n2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:03.640\n It will be phase one and phase two.\n\n2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:05.480\n So it probably would have been taking\n\n2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:08.600\n the Doom rendering engine and bringing in\n\n2:46:08.600 --> 2:46:10.720\n the TCP IP client server.\n\n2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:12.200\n Focusing on the multiplayer.\n\n2:46:12.200 --> 2:46:15.240\n And the Quake C or would have been Doom C\n\n2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:16.920\n programming language there.\n\n2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:19.360\n So I would have split that into programming language\n\n2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:21.800\n and networking with the same Doom engine\n\n2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:24.000\n rather than forcing everybody to go towards\n\n2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:27.640\n the Quake engine, which really meant getting a Pentium.\n\n2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:31.000\n While it ran on a 486, it was not a great experience there.\n\n2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:33.000\n We could have made more people happier\n\n2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:37.320\n and gotten two games done in 50% more time.\n\n2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:41.640\n So speaking of people happier, our mutual friend,\n\n2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:46.320\n Joe Rogan, it seems like the most important moment\n\n2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:49.480\n of his life is centered around Quake.\n\n2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:53.520\n So it was a definitive part of his life.\n\n2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:58.220\n So would he agree with your thinking that they should split?\n\n2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:01.440\n So he is a person who loves Quake\n\n2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:03.320\n and played Quake a lot.\n\n2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:06.760\n Would he agree that you should have done the Doom engine\n\n2:47:06.760 --> 2:47:09.680\n and focus on the multiplayer for phase one?\n\n2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:14.680\n Or in your looking back, is the 3D world\n\n2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:17.640\n that Quake created was also fundamental\n\n2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:19.560\n to the enriching experience?\n\n2:47:19.560 --> 2:47:21.560\n You know, I would say that what would have happened\n\n2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:25.280\n is you would have had a Doom looking\n\n2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:29.960\n but Quake feeling game eight months earlier\n\n2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:33.120\n and then maybe six months after Quake actually shipped,\n\n2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:36.380\n then there would have been the full running on a Pentium,\n\n2:47:36.380 --> 2:47:38.720\n six degree of freedom graphics engine type things there.\n\n2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:42.040\n So it's not that it wouldn't have been there.\n\n2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:45.000\n It would have been something amazingly cool earlier\n\n2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:47.740\n and then something even cooler somewhat later\n\n2:47:47.740 --> 2:47:50.320\n where I would much rather have gone\n\n2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:53.200\n and done two one year development efforts.\n\n2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:54.800\n I've cycled them through.\n\n2:47:54.800 --> 2:47:57.460\n I've been a little more pragmatic about that\n\n2:47:57.460 --> 2:48:00.280\n rather than killing us ourselves on the whole Quake\n\n2:48:00.280 --> 2:48:01.120\n development.\n\n2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:04.100\n But I would say it's obviously things worked out well\n\n2:48:04.100 --> 2:48:06.440\n in the end, but looking back and saying,\n\n2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:08.960\n how would I optimize and do things differently?\n\n2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:13.160\n That did seem to be a clear case where I going ahead\n\n2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:15.840\n and we had enormous momentum on Doom.\n\n2:48:15.840 --> 2:48:19.120\n We did Doom two as the kind of commercial boxed version\n\n2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:22.140\n after our shareware success with the original,\n\n2:48:22.140 --> 2:48:25.720\n but we could have just made another Doom game\n\n2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:27.640\n adding those new features in.\n\n2:48:27.640 --> 2:48:28.640\n It would have been huge.\n\n2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:31.440\n We would have learned all the same lessons, but faster.\n\n2:48:31.440 --> 2:48:34.120\n And it would have given six degree of freedom\n\n2:48:34.120 --> 2:48:37.020\n and Pentium class systems a little bit more time\n\n2:48:37.020 --> 2:48:40.080\n to get mainstream because we did cut out a lot of people\n\n2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:42.880\n with the hardware requirements for Quake.\n\n2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:44.800\n Was there any dark moments for you personally,\n\n2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:49.800\n psychologically in having such harsh deadlines\n\n2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:54.680\n and having to solve so many difficult technical challenges?\n\n2:48:54.680 --> 2:48:59.680\n So I've never really had really dark black places.\n\n2:49:00.660 --> 2:49:02.660\n I mean, I can't necessarily put myself\n\n2:49:02.660 --> 2:49:03.940\n in anyone else's shoes,\n\n2:49:03.940 --> 2:49:08.940\n but I understand a lot of people have significant challenges\n\n2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:12.460\n with kind of their mental health and wellbeing.\n\n2:49:12.460 --> 2:49:15.000\n And I've been super stressed.\n\n2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:18.720\n I've been unhappy as a teenager in various ways,\n\n2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:23.660\n but I've never really gone to a very dark place.\n\n2:49:23.660 --> 2:49:28.660\n I just seem to be largely immune to what really wrecks people.\n\n2:49:29.800 --> 2:49:32.260\n I mean, I've had plenty of time when I'm very unhappy\n\n2:49:32.260 --> 2:49:33.860\n and miserable about something,\n\n2:49:33.860 --> 2:49:36.380\n but it's never hit me like,\n\n2:49:36.380 --> 2:49:38.740\n I believe it winds up hitting some other people.\n\n2:49:38.740 --> 2:49:41.660\n I've borne up well under whatever stresses\n\n2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:44.340\n have kind of fallen on me.\n\n2:49:44.340 --> 2:49:46.900\n And I've always coped best on that\n\n2:49:46.900 --> 2:49:49.460\n when all I need to do is usually\n\n2:49:49.460 --> 2:49:51.180\n just kind of bear down on my work.\n\n2:49:51.180 --> 2:49:55.060\n I pull myself out of whatever hole I might be slipping into\n\n2:49:55.060 --> 2:49:57.300\n by actually making progress.\n\n2:49:57.300 --> 2:49:59.460\n I mean, maybe if I was in a position\n\n2:49:59.460 --> 2:50:01.740\n where I was never able to make that progress,\n\n2:50:01.740 --> 2:50:03.300\n I could have slid down further,\n\n2:50:03.300 --> 2:50:06.220\n but I've always been in a place where,\n\n2:50:06.220 --> 2:50:07.540\n okay, a little bit more work,\n\n2:50:07.540 --> 2:50:09.080\n maybe I'm in a tough spot here,\n\n2:50:09.080 --> 2:50:12.240\n but I always know if I just keep pushing,\n\n2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:14.640\n eventually I break through and I make progress,\n\n2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:16.420\n I feel good about what I'm doing.\n\n2:50:17.460 --> 2:50:20.660\n And that's been enough for me so far in my life.\n\n2:50:20.660 --> 2:50:22.500\n Have you seen it in the distance,\n\n2:50:23.700 --> 2:50:28.700\n like ideas of depression or contemplating suicide?\n\n2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:30.500\n Have you seen those things far?\n\n2:50:30.500 --> 2:50:33.100\n So what was interesting, when I was a teenager,\n\n2:50:33.100 --> 2:50:37.300\n I was probably on some level a troubled youth.\n\n2:50:37.300 --> 2:50:40.740\n I was unhappy most of my teenage years.\n\n2:50:40.740 --> 2:50:42.580\n I really, I wanted to be on my own\n\n2:50:42.580 --> 2:50:44.540\n doing programming all the time.\n\n2:50:44.540 --> 2:50:47.620\n As soon as I was 18, 19, even though I was poor,\n\n2:50:47.620 --> 2:50:50.700\n I was doing exactly what I wanted and I was very happy,\n\n2:50:50.700 --> 2:50:53.020\n but high school was not a great time for me.\n\n2:50:53.020 --> 2:50:56.920\n And I had a conversation with like the school counselor\n\n2:50:56.920 --> 2:50:58.540\n and they're kind of running their script.\n\n2:50:58.540 --> 2:51:00.580\n It's like, okay, it's kind of a weird kid here.\n\n2:51:00.580 --> 2:51:02.380\n Let's carefully probe around.\n\n2:51:02.380 --> 2:51:05.700\n It's like, do you ever think about ending it all?\n\n2:51:05.700 --> 2:51:07.500\n I'm like, no, of course not.\n\n2:51:07.500 --> 2:51:08.980\n Never, not at all.\n\n2:51:08.980 --> 2:51:11.420\n This is temporary, things are going to be better.\n\n2:51:13.140 --> 2:51:15.580\n And that's always been kind of the case for me.\n\n2:51:15.580 --> 2:51:18.300\n And obviously that's not that way for everyone\n\n2:51:18.300 --> 2:51:20.900\n and other people do react differently.\n\n2:51:20.900 --> 2:51:24.940\n What was your escape from the troubled youth,\n\n2:51:24.940 --> 2:51:29.940\n like music, video games, books?\n\n2:51:33.660 --> 2:51:35.460\n How did you escape from a world\n\n2:51:35.460 --> 2:51:38.180\n that's full of cruelty and suffering and that's absurd?\n\n2:51:38.180 --> 2:51:41.800\n Yeah, I mean, I was not a victim of cruelty and suffering.\n\n2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:44.340\n It's like, I was an unhappy, somewhat petulant youth\n\n2:51:44.340 --> 2:51:48.260\n in my point where I'm not putting myself up\n\n2:51:48.260 --> 2:51:49.700\n with anybody else's suffering,\n\n2:51:49.700 --> 2:51:52.260\n but I was unhappy objectively.\n\n2:51:52.260 --> 2:51:54.820\n And the things that I did\n\n2:51:54.820 --> 2:51:57.260\n that very much characterized my childhood\n\n2:51:57.260 --> 2:52:00.460\n were I had books, comic books,\n\n2:52:00.460 --> 2:52:03.740\n Dungeons and Dragons, arcade games, video games.\n\n2:52:03.740 --> 2:52:06.380\n Like some of my fondest childhood memories\n\n2:52:06.380 --> 2:52:08.900\n are the convenience stores, the 711s and Quick Trips,\n\n2:52:08.900 --> 2:52:11.380\n because they had a spinner rack of comic books\n\n2:52:11.380 --> 2:52:12.700\n and they had a little side room\n\n2:52:12.700 --> 2:52:15.780\n with two or three video games, arcade games in it.\n\n2:52:15.780 --> 2:52:18.780\n And that was very much my happy place.\n\n2:52:18.780 --> 2:52:20.820\n If I could, I get my comic books\n\n2:52:20.820 --> 2:52:22.580\n and if I could go to a library\n\n2:52:22.580 --> 2:52:25.740\n and go through those little zero, zero, zero section\n\n2:52:25.740 --> 2:52:27.380\n where computer books were supposed to be.\n\n2:52:27.380 --> 2:52:28.980\n And there were a few sad little books there,\n\n2:52:28.980 --> 2:52:31.860\n but still just being able to sit down and go through that.\n\n2:52:31.860 --> 2:52:35.740\n And I read a ridiculous number of books,\n\n2:52:35.740 --> 2:52:38.620\n both fiction and nonfiction as a teenager.\n\n2:52:38.620 --> 2:52:42.780\n And my rebelling in high school\n\n2:52:42.780 --> 2:52:44.500\n was just sitting there with my nose in a book,\n\n2:52:44.500 --> 2:52:46.820\n ignoring the class through lots of it.\n\n2:52:46.820 --> 2:52:49.420\n And teachers had a range of reactions to that,\n\n2:52:49.420 --> 2:52:52.340\n some more accepting of it than others.\n\n2:52:53.580 --> 2:52:54.580\n I'm with you on that.\n\n2:52:54.580 --> 2:52:56.540\n So let us return to Quake for a bit\n\n2:52:56.540 --> 2:52:57.860\n with the technical challenges.\n\n2:52:57.860 --> 2:53:02.860\n What everything together from the networking\n\n2:53:03.460 --> 2:53:07.180\n to the graphics, what are some things you remember\n\n2:53:07.180 --> 2:53:10.460\n that were innovations you had to come up with\n\n2:53:10.460 --> 2:53:12.380\n in order to make it all happen?\n\n2:53:12.380 --> 2:53:14.860\n Yeah, so there were a bunch of things on Quake\n\n2:53:14.860 --> 2:53:16.380\n where on the one hand,\n\n2:53:16.380 --> 2:53:19.260\n the idea that I built my own programming language\n\n2:53:19.260 --> 2:53:20.940\n to implement the game in.\n\n2:53:20.940 --> 2:53:22.900\n Looking back, and I try to tell people,\n\n2:53:22.900 --> 2:53:25.460\n it's like every high level programmer\n\n2:53:25.460 --> 2:53:26.860\n sometime in their career goes through\n\n2:53:26.860 --> 2:53:28.020\n and they invent their own language.\n\n2:53:28.020 --> 2:53:30.380\n It just seems to be a thing that's pretty broadly done.\n\n2:53:30.380 --> 2:53:31.220\n People will be like,\n\n2:53:31.220 --> 2:53:33.220\n I'm gonna go write a computer programming language.\n\n2:53:33.220 --> 2:53:37.100\n And I don't regret having done it,\n\n2:53:37.100 --> 2:53:40.100\n but after that, I switched from Quake C,\n\n2:53:40.100 --> 2:53:43.060\n my quirky little pseudo object oriented\n\n2:53:43.060 --> 2:53:45.300\n or entity oriented language there.\n\n2:53:45.300 --> 2:53:47.900\n Quake two went back to using DLLs with C\n\n2:53:47.900 --> 2:53:48.900\n and then Quake three,\n\n2:53:48.900 --> 2:53:51.340\n I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler,\n\n2:53:51.340 --> 2:53:53.180\n which was a much smarter thing to do\n\n2:53:53.180 --> 2:53:55.780\n that I should have done originally for Quake.\n\n2:53:55.780 --> 2:53:57.820\n But building my own language was an experience.\n\n2:53:57.820 --> 2:53:59.660\n I learned a lot from that.\n\n2:53:59.660 --> 2:54:02.260\n And then there was a generation of game programmers\n\n2:54:02.260 --> 2:54:04.260\n that learned programming with Quake C,\n\n2:54:04.260 --> 2:54:05.660\n which I feel kind of bad about,\n\n2:54:05.660 --> 2:54:08.660\n because we give JavaScript a lot of crap,\n\n2:54:08.660 --> 2:54:13.060\n but Quake C was nothing to write home about there.\n\n2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:15.700\n But it allowed people to do magical things.\n\n2:54:15.700 --> 2:54:16.780\n You get into programming,\n\n2:54:16.780 --> 2:54:21.300\n not because you love the BNF syntax of a language,\n\n2:54:21.300 --> 2:54:23.340\n it's because the language lets you do something\n\n2:54:23.340 --> 2:54:24.460\n that you cared about.\n\n2:54:24.460 --> 2:54:25.620\n And here's very much,\n\n2:54:25.620 --> 2:54:26.980\n you could do something\n\n2:54:26.980 --> 2:54:29.540\n in a whole beautiful three dimensional world.\n\n2:54:29.540 --> 2:54:31.220\n And the idea and the fact that the code\n\n2:54:31.220 --> 2:54:32.260\n for the game was out there,\n\n2:54:32.260 --> 2:54:34.500\n you could say, I liked the shotgun,\n\n2:54:34.500 --> 2:54:36.060\n but I want it to be more bad ass.\n\n2:54:36.060 --> 2:54:37.180\n You go in there and say,\n\n2:54:37.180 --> 2:54:39.220\n okay, now it does 200 points damage.\n\n2:54:39.220 --> 2:54:41.500\n And then you go around with a big grin on your face,\n\n2:54:41.500 --> 2:54:43.940\n blowing up monsters all over the game.\n\n2:54:43.940 --> 2:54:48.220\n So yeah, it is not what I would do today\n\n2:54:48.220 --> 2:54:49.540\n going back with that language,\n\n2:54:49.540 --> 2:54:51.260\n but that was a big part of it.\n\n2:54:51.260 --> 2:54:54.060\n Learning about the networking stuff,\n\n2:54:54.060 --> 2:54:56.820\n because it's interesting where I learned these things\n\n2:54:56.820 --> 2:54:57.660\n by reading books.\n\n2:54:57.660 --> 2:55:00.100\n So I would get a book on networking and find something,\n\n2:55:00.100 --> 2:55:02.700\n I read all about it and learn, okay, packets,\n\n2:55:02.700 --> 2:55:06.380\n they can be out of order or lost or duplicated.\n\n2:55:06.380 --> 2:55:07.220\n These are all the things\n\n2:55:07.220 --> 2:55:09.300\n that can theoretically happen to packets.\n\n2:55:09.300 --> 2:55:11.420\n So I wind up spending all this time thinking about\n\n2:55:11.420 --> 2:55:13.100\n how do we deal about all of that?\n\n2:55:13.100 --> 2:55:15.100\n And it turns out, of course, in the real world,\n\n2:55:15.100 --> 2:55:16.020\n those are things that yes,\n\n2:55:16.020 --> 2:55:18.100\n theoretically can happen with multiple routes,\n\n2:55:18.100 --> 2:55:22.100\n but they really aren't things that your 99.999%\n\n2:55:22.100 --> 2:55:24.020\n of your packets have to deal with.\n\n2:55:25.100 --> 2:55:28.300\n So there was learning experiences about lots of that.\n\n2:55:28.300 --> 2:55:32.060\n Like why, when TCP is appropriate versus UDP\n\n2:55:32.060 --> 2:55:34.140\n and how if you do things in UDP,\n\n2:55:34.140 --> 2:55:37.900\n you wind up reinventing TCP badly in almost all cases.\n\n2:55:37.900 --> 2:55:41.540\n So there's good arguments for using both\n\n2:55:41.540 --> 2:55:42.780\n for different game technology,\n\n2:55:42.780 --> 2:55:44.380\n different parts of the game process,\n\n2:55:44.380 --> 2:55:46.700\n transitioning from level to level and all.\n\n2:55:46.700 --> 2:55:49.340\n But the graphics were the showcase\n\n2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:51.900\n of what Quake was all about.\n\n2:55:51.900 --> 2:55:55.500\n It was this graphics technology that nobody had seen there.\n\n2:55:55.500 --> 2:55:57.420\n And it was a while before\n\n2:55:57.420 --> 2:55:59.540\n there were competitive things out there.\n\n2:55:59.540 --> 2:56:03.580\n And it went a long time internally really not working\n\n2:56:03.580 --> 2:56:05.580\n where we were even building levels\n\n2:56:05.580 --> 2:56:09.620\n where the game just was not at all shippable\n\n2:56:09.620 --> 2:56:11.220\n with large fractions of the world,\n\n2:56:11.220 --> 2:56:14.020\n like disappearing, not being there,\n\n2:56:14.020 --> 2:56:16.860\n or being really slow in various parts of it.\n\n2:56:16.860 --> 2:56:18.300\n And it was this act of faith.\n\n2:56:18.300 --> 2:56:20.660\n It's like, I think I'm gonna be able to fix this.\n\n2:56:20.660 --> 2:56:22.820\n I think I'm gonna be able to make this work.\n\n2:56:23.700 --> 2:56:25.660\n And lots of stuff changed\n\n2:56:25.660 --> 2:56:27.900\n where the level designers would build something\n\n2:56:27.900 --> 2:56:29.980\n and then have to throw it away as something fundamental\n\n2:56:29.980 --> 2:56:33.780\n and the kind of graphics or level technology changed.\n\n2:56:33.780 --> 2:56:37.180\n And so there were two big things\n\n2:56:37.180 --> 2:56:41.300\n that contributed to making it possible at that timeframe.\n\n2:56:41.300 --> 2:56:42.300\n Two new things.\n\n2:56:42.300 --> 2:56:43.660\n There was certainly\n\n2:56:43.660 --> 2:56:46.060\n hardcore optimized low level assembly language.\n\n2:56:46.060 --> 2:56:48.620\n And this was where I had hired Michael Abrash\n\n2:56:48.620 --> 2:56:50.260\n away from Microsoft.\n\n2:56:50.260 --> 2:56:52.340\n And he had been one of my early inspirations\n\n2:56:52.340 --> 2:56:54.700\n where back in the soft disk days,\n\n2:56:54.700 --> 2:56:57.300\n the library of magazines that they had,\n\n2:56:57.300 --> 2:56:58.820\n some of my most treasured ones\n\n2:56:58.820 --> 2:57:02.380\n were Michael Abrash's articles in Dr. Dobbs journal.\n\n2:57:02.380 --> 2:57:06.380\n And it was amazing after all of our success in Doom,\n\n2:57:06.380 --> 2:57:08.020\n we were able to kind of hit him up and say,\n\n2:57:08.020 --> 2:57:10.540\n hey, we'd like you to come work at id Software.\n\n2:57:10.540 --> 2:57:13.140\n And he was in the senior technical role at Microsoft.\n\n2:57:13.140 --> 2:57:15.860\n And he was on track for,\n\n2:57:15.860 --> 2:57:18.260\n and this was right when Microsoft was starting to take off.\n\n2:57:18.260 --> 2:57:21.620\n And I did eventually convince him\n\n2:57:21.620 --> 2:57:22.740\n that what we were doing\n\n2:57:22.740 --> 2:57:24.540\n was gonna be really amazing with Quake.\n\n2:57:24.540 --> 2:57:28.260\n It was gonna be something nobody had seen before.\n\n2:57:28.260 --> 2:57:31.420\n It had these aspects of what we were talking about.\n\n2:57:31.420 --> 2:57:33.580\n We had metaverse talk back then.\n\n2:57:33.580 --> 2:57:36.660\n We had read Snow Crash and we knew about this.\n\n2:57:36.660 --> 2:57:40.140\n And Michael was big into the science fiction\n\n2:57:40.140 --> 2:57:41.420\n and we would talk about all that\n\n2:57:41.420 --> 2:57:42.860\n and kind of spin this tale.\n\n2:57:42.860 --> 2:57:45.140\n And it was some of the same conversations\n\n2:57:45.140 --> 2:57:46.860\n that we have today about the metaverse,\n\n2:57:46.860 --> 2:57:48.900\n about how you could have different areas\n\n2:57:48.900 --> 2:57:50.300\n linked together by portals\n\n2:57:50.300 --> 2:57:52.340\n and you could have user generated content\n\n2:57:52.340 --> 2:57:54.380\n and changing out all of these things.\n\n2:57:54.380 --> 2:57:56.900\n So you really were creating the metaverse with Quake.\n\n2:57:56.900 --> 2:57:58.740\n And we talked about things like,\n\n2:57:58.740 --> 2:58:02.780\n Duke used to be advertised as a virtual reality experience.\n\n2:58:02.780 --> 2:58:05.220\n That was the first wave of virtual reality\n\n2:58:05.220 --> 2:58:07.620\n was in the late 80s and early 90s,\n\n2:58:07.620 --> 2:58:10.580\n you had like the Lawn Mower Man movie\n\n2:58:10.580 --> 2:58:12.100\n and you had time in Newsweek\n\n2:58:12.100 --> 2:58:14.580\n talking about the early VPL headsets.\n\n2:58:14.580 --> 2:58:16.780\n And of course that cratered so hard\n\n2:58:16.780 --> 2:58:18.660\n that people didn't wanna look at virtual reality\n\n2:58:18.660 --> 2:58:20.140\n for decades afterwards,\n\n2:58:20.140 --> 2:58:23.220\n where it was just, it was smoke and mirrors.\n\n2:58:23.220 --> 2:58:24.820\n It was not real in the sense\n\n2:58:24.820 --> 2:58:26.700\n that you could actually do something\n\n2:58:26.700 --> 2:58:28.580\n real and valuable with it.\n\n2:58:28.580 --> 2:58:32.220\n But still we had that kind of common set of talking points.\n\n2:58:32.220 --> 2:58:36.340\n And we were talking about what these games could become\n\n2:58:36.340 --> 2:58:37.900\n and how you'd like to see people\n\n2:58:37.900 --> 2:58:39.580\n building all of these creative things.\n\n2:58:39.580 --> 2:58:41.460\n Because we were seeing an explosion of work\n\n2:58:41.460 --> 2:58:42.620\n with Doom at that time,\n\n2:58:42.620 --> 2:58:45.700\n where people were doing amazingly cool things.\n\n2:58:45.700 --> 2:58:48.100\n Like we saw cooler levels that we had built\n\n2:58:48.100 --> 2:58:49.740\n coming out of the user community.\n\n2:58:49.740 --> 2:58:51.420\n And then people finding ways\n\n2:58:51.420 --> 2:58:54.060\n to change the characters in different ways.\n\n2:58:54.060 --> 2:58:54.900\n And it was great.\n\n2:58:54.900 --> 2:58:56.700\n And we knew what we were doing in Quake\n\n2:58:56.700 --> 2:58:58.860\n was removing those last things.\n\n2:58:58.860 --> 2:59:00.380\n There was some quirky things\n\n2:59:00.380 --> 2:59:01.980\n with a couple of the data types\n\n2:59:01.980 --> 2:59:03.900\n that didn't work right for overriding.\n\n2:59:03.900 --> 2:59:07.380\n And then the core thing about the programming model.\n\n2:59:07.380 --> 2:59:10.900\n And I was definitely going to hit all of those in Quake.\n\n2:59:10.900 --> 2:59:15.540\n But the graphics side of it was still,\n\n2:59:15.540 --> 2:59:17.060\n I knew what I wanted to do.\n\n2:59:17.060 --> 2:59:20.460\n And it was one of these hubris things\n\n2:59:20.460 --> 2:59:21.980\n where it's like, well, so far I've been able\n\n2:59:21.980 --> 2:59:26.580\n to kind of kick everything that I set out to go do.\n\n2:59:26.580 --> 2:59:29.380\n But Quake was definitely a little bit more\n\n2:59:29.380 --> 2:59:32.180\n than could be comfortably chewed at that point.\n\n2:59:32.180 --> 2:59:36.860\n And, but Michael was one of the strongest programmers\n\n2:59:36.860 --> 2:59:39.140\n and graphics programmers that I knew.\n\n2:59:39.140 --> 2:59:40.860\n And he was one of the people that I trusted\n\n2:59:40.860 --> 2:59:44.260\n to write assembly code better than I could.\n\n2:59:44.260 --> 2:59:46.740\n And there's a few people that I can point to\n\n2:59:46.740 --> 2:59:49.940\n about things like this where I'm a world class optimizer.\n\n2:59:49.940 --> 2:59:51.740\n I mean, I make things go fast,\n\n2:59:51.740 --> 2:59:54.660\n but I recognize there's a number of people\n\n2:59:54.660 --> 2:59:56.860\n that can write tighter assembly code,\n\n2:59:56.860 --> 2:59:59.380\n tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA code\n\n2:59:59.380 --> 3:00:01.060\n than I can write.\n\n3:00:02.140 --> 3:00:05.340\n My best strengths are a little bit more at the system level.\n\n3:00:05.340 --> 3:00:07.020\n I mean, I'm good at all of that,\n\n3:00:07.020 --> 3:00:10.260\n but the most leverage comes from making the decisions\n\n3:00:10.260 --> 3:00:11.620\n that are a little bit higher up\n\n3:00:11.620 --> 3:00:15.220\n where you figure out how to change your large scale problems\n\n3:00:15.220 --> 3:00:18.020\n so that these lower level problems are easier to do\n\n3:00:18.020 --> 3:00:23.020\n or it makes it possible to do them in a uniquely fast way.\n\n3:00:23.380 --> 3:00:27.100\n So most of my big wins in a lot of ways\n\n3:00:27.100 --> 3:00:30.300\n from all the way from the early games through VR\n\n3:00:30.300 --> 3:00:33.020\n and the aerospace work that I'm doing or did,\n\n3:00:33.020 --> 3:00:35.420\n and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on now\n\n3:00:35.420 --> 3:00:37.620\n is finding an angle on something\n\n3:00:37.620 --> 3:00:40.340\n that means you trade off something\n\n3:00:40.340 --> 3:00:41.540\n that you maybe think you need,\n\n3:00:41.540 --> 3:00:43.060\n but it turns out you don't need.\n\n3:00:43.060 --> 3:00:45.860\n And by making a sacrifice in one place,\n\n3:00:45.860 --> 3:00:48.820\n you can get big advantages in another place.\n\n3:00:48.820 --> 3:00:51.660\n Is it clear at which level of the system\n\n3:00:51.660 --> 3:00:54.300\n those big advantages can be gained?\n\n3:00:54.300 --> 3:00:55.580\n It's not always clear.\n\n3:00:55.580 --> 3:00:58.300\n And that's why the thing that I try\n\n3:00:58.300 --> 3:01:00.140\n to make one of my core values,\n\n3:01:00.140 --> 3:01:02.740\n and I proselytize to a lot of people\n\n3:01:02.740 --> 3:01:05.500\n is trying to know the entire stack,\n\n3:01:05.500 --> 3:01:08.140\n trying to see through everything that happens.\n\n3:01:08.140 --> 3:01:09.580\n And it's almost impossible\n\n3:01:09.580 --> 3:01:11.860\n on like the web browser level of things\n\n3:01:11.860 --> 3:01:13.460\n where there's so many levels to it,\n\n3:01:13.460 --> 3:01:15.820\n but you should at least understand what they all are,\n\n3:01:15.820 --> 3:01:16.980\n even if you can't understand\n\n3:01:16.980 --> 3:01:20.020\n all the performance characteristics at each level,\n\n3:01:20.020 --> 3:01:22.980\n but it goes all the way down to literally the hardware.\n\n3:01:22.980 --> 3:01:26.540\n So what is this chip capable of?\n\n3:01:26.540 --> 3:01:29.380\n And what is this software that you're writing capable of?\n\n3:01:29.380 --> 3:01:31.740\n And then with this architecture you put on top of that,\n\n3:01:31.740 --> 3:01:33.300\n then the ecosystem around it,\n\n3:01:33.300 --> 3:01:35.940\n all the people that are working on it.\n\n3:01:35.940 --> 3:01:38.500\n So there are all these decisions\n\n3:01:38.500 --> 3:01:41.220\n and they're never made in a globally optimal way,\n\n3:01:41.220 --> 3:01:43.420\n but sometimes you can drive a thread\n\n3:01:43.420 --> 3:01:45.100\n of global optimality through it.\n\n3:01:45.100 --> 3:01:47.740\n You can't look at everything, it's too complicated,\n\n3:01:47.740 --> 3:01:49.700\n but sometimes you can step back up\n\n3:01:49.700 --> 3:01:51.540\n and make a different decision.\n\n3:01:51.540 --> 3:01:53.460\n And we kind of went through this on the graphic side\n\n3:01:53.460 --> 3:01:56.500\n on Quake, where in some ways it was kind of bad\n\n3:01:56.500 --> 3:01:59.100\n where Michael would spend his time writing,\n\n3:01:59.100 --> 3:02:01.660\n like I'd rough out the basic routines,\n\n3:02:01.660 --> 3:02:03.940\n like, okay, here's our span rasterizer.\n\n3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:05.980\n And he would spend a month writing\n\n3:02:05.980 --> 3:02:10.540\n this beautiful cycle optimized piece of assembly language\n\n3:02:10.540 --> 3:02:13.300\n that does what I asked it to do.\n\n3:02:13.300 --> 3:02:16.100\n And he did it faster than like my original code would do,\n\n3:02:16.100 --> 3:02:17.660\n or probably what I would be able to do\n\n3:02:17.660 --> 3:02:19.540\n even if I had spent that month on it.\n\n3:02:20.420 --> 3:02:22.660\n But then we'd have some cases when I'd be like,\n\n3:02:22.660 --> 3:02:25.460\n okay, well, I figured out at this higher level\n\n3:02:25.460 --> 3:02:28.100\n instead of drawing these in a painter's order here,\n\n3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:32.540\n I do a span buffer and it cuts out 30% or 40%\n\n3:02:32.540 --> 3:02:34.020\n of all of these pixels,\n\n3:02:34.020 --> 3:02:36.580\n but it means you need to rewrite kind of this interface\n\n3:02:36.580 --> 3:02:37.420\n of all of that.\n\n3:02:37.420 --> 3:02:39.340\n And I could tell that wore on him a little bit,\n\n3:02:39.340 --> 3:02:41.940\n but in the end it was the right thing to do\n\n3:02:41.940 --> 3:02:45.100\n where we wound up changing that rasterization approach\n\n3:02:45.100 --> 3:02:47.220\n and we wound up with a super optimized\n\n3:02:47.220 --> 3:02:49.740\n assembly language core loop\n\n3:02:49.740 --> 3:02:51.660\n and then a good system around it\n\n3:02:51.660 --> 3:02:54.380\n which minimized how much that had to be called.\n\n3:02:54.380 --> 3:02:55.740\n And so in order to be able to do\n\n3:02:55.740 --> 3:02:58.140\n this kind of system level thinking,\n\n3:02:58.140 --> 3:03:02.420\n whether we're talking about game development,\n\n3:03:02.420 --> 3:03:07.420\n aerospace, nuclear energy, AI, VR,\n\n3:03:07.420 --> 3:03:10.700\n you have to be able to understand the hardware,\n\n3:03:10.700 --> 3:03:14.740\n the low level software, the high level software,\n\n3:03:14.740 --> 3:03:16.860\n the design decisions, the whole thing,\n\n3:03:16.860 --> 3:03:18.180\n the full stack of it.\n\n3:03:18.180 --> 3:03:20.480\n Yeah, and that's where a lot of these things\n\n3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:21.320\n become possible.\n\n3:03:21.320 --> 3:03:23.940\n When you're really, when you're bringing the future forward,\n\n3:03:23.940 --> 3:03:25.180\n I mean, there's a pace that everything\n\n3:03:25.180 --> 3:03:26.460\n just kind of glides towards\n\n3:03:26.460 --> 3:03:27.960\n where we have a lot of progress\n\n3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:29.340\n that's happening at such a different,\n\n3:03:29.340 --> 3:03:32.300\n so many different ways you kind of slide towards progress\n\n3:03:32.300 --> 3:03:34.880\n just left to your own, programs just get faster.\n\n3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:36.120\n For a while it wasn't clear\n\n3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:38.420\n if they were gonna get fatter more than they get,\n\n3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:40.740\n quicker than they get faster and it cancels out,\n\n3:03:40.740 --> 3:03:42.400\n but it is clear now in retrospect,\n\n3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:44.020\n no, programs just get faster\n\n3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:46.620\n and have gotten faster for a long time.\n\n3:03:46.620 --> 3:03:48.020\n But if you wanna do something\n\n3:03:48.020 --> 3:03:52.060\n like back at that original talking about scrolling games,\n\n3:03:52.060 --> 3:03:54.700\n say what, this needs to be five times faster.\n\n3:03:54.700 --> 3:03:57.220\n Well, we can wait six years\n\n3:03:57.220 --> 3:04:00.820\n and just it'll naturally get that much faster at that time\n\n3:04:00.820 --> 3:04:03.700\n or you come up with some really clever way of doing it.\n\n3:04:03.700 --> 3:04:06.140\n So there are those opportunities like that\n\n3:04:06.140 --> 3:04:08.100\n in a whole bunch of different areas.\n\n3:04:08.100 --> 3:04:11.780\n Now, most programmers don't need to be thinking about that.\n\n3:04:11.780 --> 3:04:13.440\n There's not that many,\n\n3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:15.100\n there's a lot of opportunities for this,\n\n3:04:15.100 --> 3:04:17.240\n but it's not everyone's work a day type stuff.\n\n3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:20.340\n So everyone doesn't have to know how all these things work.\n\n3:04:20.340 --> 3:04:22.900\n They don't have to know how their compiler works,\n\n3:04:22.900 --> 3:04:26.180\n how the processor chip manages cache eviction\n\n3:04:26.180 --> 3:04:28.180\n and all these low level things.\n\n3:04:28.180 --> 3:04:31.720\n But sometimes there are powerful opportunities\n\n3:04:31.720 --> 3:04:33.180\n that you can look at and say,\n\n3:04:33.180 --> 3:04:37.220\n we can bring the future five years faster.\n\n3:04:37.220 --> 3:04:38.420\n We can do something that,\n\n3:04:38.420 --> 3:04:40.300\n wouldn't it be great if we could do this?\n\n3:04:40.300 --> 3:04:42.020\n Well, we can do it today\n\n3:04:42.020 --> 3:04:44.200\n if we make a certain set of decisions.\n\n3:04:44.200 --> 3:04:47.180\n And it is in some ways smoke and mirrors\n\n3:04:47.180 --> 3:04:48.460\n where you say it's like,\n\n3:04:48.460 --> 3:04:50.460\n Doom was a lot of smoke and mirrors\n\n3:04:50.460 --> 3:04:52.260\n where people thought it was more capable\n\n3:04:52.260 --> 3:04:53.560\n than it actually was,\n\n3:04:53.560 --> 3:04:56.020\n but we picked the right smoke and mirrors\n\n3:04:56.020 --> 3:04:58.980\n to deploy in the game where by doing this,\n\n3:04:58.980 --> 3:05:01.100\n people will think that it's more general.\n\n3:05:01.100 --> 3:05:03.420\n We are gonna amaze them with what they've got here\n\n3:05:03.420 --> 3:05:05.020\n and they won't notice\n\n3:05:05.020 --> 3:05:07.660\n that it doesn't do these other things.\n\n3:05:07.660 --> 3:05:09.940\n So smart decision making at that point,\n\n3:05:09.940 --> 3:05:14.940\n that's where that kind of global holistic top down view\n\n3:05:15.740 --> 3:05:16.560\n can work.\n\n3:05:16.560 --> 3:05:20.240\n And I'm really a strong believer\n\n3:05:20.240 --> 3:05:24.020\n that technology should be sitting at that table\n\n3:05:24.020 --> 3:05:25.100\n having those discussions\n\n3:05:25.100 --> 3:05:26.700\n because you do have cases where you say,\n\n3:05:26.700 --> 3:05:28.660\n well, you wanna be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever,\n\n3:05:28.660 --> 3:05:32.100\n where it's a pure design solution.\n\n3:05:32.100 --> 3:05:35.200\n And that's in some cases now\n\n3:05:35.200 --> 3:05:37.740\n where you truly have almost infinite resources.\n\n3:05:37.740 --> 3:05:41.500\n Like if you're trying to do a scrolling game on the PC now,\n\n3:05:41.500 --> 3:05:43.620\n you don't even have to talk to a technology person.\n\n3:05:43.620 --> 3:05:45.460\n You can just have,\n\n3:05:45.460 --> 3:05:48.460\n any intern can make that go run as fast as it needs to there\n\n3:05:48.460 --> 3:05:50.680\n and it can be completely design based.\n\n3:05:50.680 --> 3:05:53.180\n But if you're trying to do something that's hard,\n\n3:05:53.180 --> 3:05:55.840\n either that can't be done for resources\n\n3:05:55.840 --> 3:05:58.060\n like VR on a mobile chip set,\n\n3:05:58.060 --> 3:05:59.820\n or that we don't even know how to do yet,\n\n3:05:59.820 --> 3:06:02.020\n like artificial general intelligence,\n\n3:06:02.020 --> 3:06:03.740\n it's probably going to be a matter\n\n3:06:03.740 --> 3:06:05.380\n of coming at it from an angle.\n\n3:06:05.380 --> 3:06:06.460\n Like, I mean, for AGI,\n\n3:06:06.460 --> 3:06:09.040\n we have some of like what are some of the hudder principles\n\n3:06:09.040 --> 3:06:11.820\n about how you can AXI or some of the,\n\n3:06:11.820 --> 3:06:13.380\n there are theoretical ways that you can say,\n\n3:06:13.380 --> 3:06:15.220\n this is the optimal learning algorithm\n\n3:06:15.220 --> 3:06:18.620\n that can solve everything, but it's completely impractical.\n\n3:06:18.620 --> 3:06:20.180\n You just can't do that.\n\n3:06:20.180 --> 3:06:23.300\n So clearly you have to make some concessions\n\n3:06:23.300 --> 3:06:25.220\n for general intelligence\n\n3:06:25.220 --> 3:06:27.300\n and nobody knows what the right ones are yet.\n\n3:06:27.300 --> 3:06:29.300\n So people are taking different angles of attack.\n\n3:06:29.300 --> 3:06:31.040\n I hope I've got something clever\n\n3:06:31.040 --> 3:06:34.060\n to come up with in that space.\n\n3:06:34.060 --> 3:06:35.460\n It's been surprising to me.\n\n3:06:35.460 --> 3:06:38.760\n And I think perhaps it is a principle of progress\n\n3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:40.580\n that smoke and mirrors somehow\n\n3:06:40.580 --> 3:06:42.820\n is the way you build the future.\n\n3:06:42.820 --> 3:06:46.380\n You kind of fake it till you make it\n\n3:06:46.380 --> 3:06:47.740\n and you almost always make it.\n\n3:06:47.740 --> 3:06:50.340\n And I think that's going to be the way we achieve AGI.\n\n3:06:50.340 --> 3:06:53.620\n That's going to be the way we build consciousness\n\n3:06:53.620 --> 3:06:55.060\n into our machines.\n\n3:06:55.060 --> 3:06:59.860\n There's philosophers debate about the Turing test\n\n3:06:59.860 --> 3:07:02.820\n is essentially about faking it till you make it.\n\n3:07:02.820 --> 3:07:04.480\n You start by faking it.\n\n3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:09.060\n And I think that always leads to making it\n\n3:07:09.060 --> 3:07:10.660\n because if we look at history.\n\n3:07:10.660 --> 3:07:13.100\n Arguments when, as soon as people start talking about\n\n3:07:13.100 --> 3:07:16.220\n qualia and consciousness and Chinese rooms and things,\n\n3:07:16.220 --> 3:07:17.560\n it's like, I just check out.\n\n3:07:17.560 --> 3:07:20.160\n I just don't think there's any value in those conversations.\n\n3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:22.460\n It's just like, go ahead, tell me it's not going to work.\n\n3:07:22.460 --> 3:07:25.340\n I'm going to do my best to try to make it work anyways.\n\n3:07:25.340 --> 3:07:26.900\n I don't know if you work with legged robots.\n\n3:07:26.900 --> 3:07:28.100\n There's a bunch of these.\n\n3:07:29.380 --> 3:07:33.880\n They sure as heck make me feel like they're cautious\n\n3:07:33.880 --> 3:07:37.120\n in a certain way that's not here today,\n\n3:07:37.120 --> 3:07:41.220\n but is you could see the kernel.\n\n3:07:41.220 --> 3:07:45.980\n It's like the flame, the beginnings of a flame.\n\n3:07:45.980 --> 3:07:47.460\n We don't have line of sight,\n\n3:07:47.460 --> 3:07:50.060\n but there's glimmerings of light in the distance\n\n3:07:50.060 --> 3:07:51.020\n for all of these things.\n\n3:07:51.020 --> 3:07:53.560\n Yeah, I'm hearing murmuring in a distant room.\n\n3:07:54.900 --> 3:07:56.780\n Well, let me ask you a human question here.\n\n3:07:56.780 --> 3:08:00.100\n You've in the game design space,\n\n3:08:00.100 --> 3:08:01.900\n you've done a lot of incredible work throughout,\n\n3:08:01.900 --> 3:08:05.800\n but in terms of game design, you have changed the world.\n\n3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:08.440\n And there's a few people around you that did the same.\n\n3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:13.020\n So famously there's some animosity, there's much love,\n\n3:08:13.020 --> 3:08:16.340\n but there's some animosity between you and John Romero.\n\n3:08:16.340 --> 3:08:19.940\n What is at the core of that animosity and human tension?\n\n3:08:19.940 --> 3:08:24.100\n So there really hasn't been for a long time.\n\n3:08:24.100 --> 3:08:25.520\n And even at the beginning, it's like,\n\n3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:29.500\n yes, I did push Romero out of the company.\n\n3:08:29.500 --> 3:08:32.140\n And this is one of the things that I look back,\n\n3:08:32.140 --> 3:08:35.980\n if I could go back telling my younger self\n\n3:08:35.980 --> 3:08:37.840\n some advice about things,\n\n3:08:37.840 --> 3:08:41.900\n the original founding kind of corporate structure\n\n3:08:41.900 --> 3:08:45.700\n of id Software really led to a bunch of problems.\n\n3:08:45.700 --> 3:08:48.540\n We started off with us as equal partners\n\n3:08:48.540 --> 3:08:50.420\n and we had a buy sell agreement\n\n3:08:50.420 --> 3:08:51.820\n because we didn't want outsiders\n\n3:08:51.820 --> 3:08:54.400\n to be telling us what to do inside the company.\n\n3:08:54.400 --> 3:08:57.260\n And that did lead to a bunch of the problems\n\n3:08:57.260 --> 3:08:59.580\n where I was sitting here going,\n\n3:08:59.580 --> 3:09:02.920\n it's like, all right, I'm working harder than anyone.\n\n3:09:02.920 --> 3:09:06.300\n I'm doing these technologies, nobody's done before,\n\n3:09:06.300 --> 3:09:08.100\n but we're all equal partners.\n\n3:09:08.100 --> 3:09:11.500\n And then I see somebody that's not working as hard.\n\n3:09:11.500 --> 3:09:16.160\n And I mean, I can't say I was the most mature about that.\n\n3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:18.020\n I was 20 something years old\n\n3:09:18.020 --> 3:09:22.460\n and it did bother me when I'm like, everybody,\n\n3:09:22.460 --> 3:09:23.980\n okay, we need to all pull together\n\n3:09:23.980 --> 3:09:25.540\n and we've done it before everybody.\n\n3:09:25.540 --> 3:09:27.700\n We know we can do this if we get together\n\n3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:29.420\n and we grind it all out,\n\n3:09:29.420 --> 3:09:33.540\n but not everybody wanted to do that for all time.\n\n3:09:33.540 --> 3:09:35.740\n And I was the youngest one of the crowd there.\n\n3:09:35.740 --> 3:09:40.480\n I had different sets of kind of backgrounds and motivations\n\n3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:44.900\n and left at that point where it was, all right,\n\n3:09:44.900 --> 3:09:48.500\n either everybody has to be contributing like up to this level\n\n3:09:48.500 --> 3:09:51.480\n or they need to get pushed out was not,\n\n3:09:52.380 --> 3:09:54.140\n that was not a great situation.\n\n3:09:54.140 --> 3:09:57.620\n And I look back on it and know that we pushed people\n\n3:09:57.620 --> 3:10:00.300\n out of the company that could have contributed\n\n3:10:00.300 --> 3:10:02.860\n if there was a different framework for them.\n\n3:10:02.860 --> 3:10:04.680\n And the modern kind of Silicon Valley,\n\n3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:07.040\n like let your stock vest over a time period\n\n3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:08.800\n and maybe it's non voting stock\n\n3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:09.820\n and all those different things.\n\n3:10:09.820 --> 3:10:11.420\n We knew nothing about any of that.\n\n3:10:11.420 --> 3:10:13.860\n I mean, we didn't know what we were doing\n\n3:10:13.860 --> 3:10:16.460\n in terms of corporate structure or anything.\n\n3:10:16.460 --> 3:10:18.460\n So if you think the framework was different,\n\n3:10:18.460 --> 3:10:20.660\n some of the human tension could have been a little bit.\n\n3:10:20.660 --> 3:10:22.900\n It almost certainly would have.\n\n3:10:22.900 --> 3:10:24.220\n I mean, I look back at that\n\n3:10:24.220 --> 3:10:27.740\n and it's like even trying to summon up in my mind,\n\n3:10:27.740 --> 3:10:31.580\n it's like, I know I was really, really angry about,\n\n3:10:32.620 --> 3:10:35.580\n like Romero not working as hard as I wanted him to work\n\n3:10:35.580 --> 3:10:39.060\n or not carrying his load on the design for Quake\n\n3:10:39.060 --> 3:10:40.940\n and coming up with things there.\n\n3:10:40.940 --> 3:10:43.100\n But he was definitely doing things.\n\n3:10:43.100 --> 3:10:44.900\n He made some of the best levels there.\n\n3:10:44.900 --> 3:10:47.740\n He was working with some of our external teams\n\n3:10:47.740 --> 3:10:50.660\n like Raven on the licensing side of things,\n\n3:10:50.660 --> 3:10:55.460\n but there were differences of opinion about it,\n\n3:10:55.460 --> 3:10:57.260\n but he landed right on his feet.\n\n3:10:57.260 --> 3:10:59.660\n He went and he got $20 million from Eidos\n\n3:10:59.660 --> 3:11:02.980\n to go do Ion Storm and he got to do things his way\n\n3:11:02.980 --> 3:11:05.700\n and spun up three teams simultaneously\n\n3:11:05.700 --> 3:11:08.180\n because that was always one of the challenging things\n\n3:11:08.180 --> 3:11:11.000\n in it where we were doing these single string,\n\n3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:13.140\n one project after another.\n\n3:11:13.140 --> 3:11:16.380\n And I think some of them wanted to grow the company more\n\n3:11:16.380 --> 3:11:19.240\n and I didn't because I knew people that were saying that,\n\n3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:22.260\n oh, companies turn to shit when you got 50 employees.\n\n3:11:22.260 --> 3:11:24.060\n It's just a different world there.\n\n3:11:24.060 --> 3:11:28.460\n And I loved our little dozen people working on the projects,\n\n3:11:28.460 --> 3:11:29.940\n but you can look at it and say,\n\n3:11:29.940 --> 3:11:31.780\n well, business realities matter.\n\n3:11:31.780 --> 3:11:33.540\n It's like, you're super successful here\n\n3:11:33.540 --> 3:11:36.340\n and we could take a swing and a miss on something,\n\n3:11:36.340 --> 3:11:39.320\n but you do it a couple of times and you're out of luck.\n\n3:11:39.320 --> 3:11:43.060\n There's a reason companies try to have multiple teams\n\n3:11:43.060 --> 3:11:44.460\n running at one time.\n\n3:11:45.660 --> 3:11:47.060\n And so that was, again,\n\n3:11:47.060 --> 3:11:49.620\n something I didn't really appreciate back then.\n\n3:11:49.620 --> 3:11:51.020\n So if you look past all that,\n\n3:11:51.020 --> 3:11:53.740\n you did create some amazing things together.\n\n3:11:53.740 --> 3:11:55.740\n What did you love about John Romero?\n\n3:11:55.740 --> 3:11:57.700\n What did you respect and appreciate about him?\n\n3:11:57.700 --> 3:11:59.100\n What did you admire about him?\n\n3:11:59.100 --> 3:12:00.980\n What did you learn from him?\n\n3:12:00.980 --> 3:12:02.460\n When I met him, he was the coolest programmer\n\n3:12:02.460 --> 3:12:04.020\n I had ever met.\n\n3:12:04.020 --> 3:12:05.580\n He had done all of this stuff.\n\n3:12:05.580 --> 3:12:07.580\n He had made all of these games.\n\n3:12:07.580 --> 3:12:10.060\n He had worked at one of the companies\n\n3:12:10.060 --> 3:12:12.740\n that I thought was the coolest at Origin Systems.\n\n3:12:12.740 --> 3:12:14.580\n And he knew all this stuff.\n\n3:12:14.580 --> 3:12:16.220\n He made things happen fast.\n\n3:12:16.220 --> 3:12:18.900\n And he was also kind of a polymath about this\n\n3:12:18.900 --> 3:12:21.580\n where he could do, he drew his own art.\n\n3:12:21.580 --> 3:12:22.780\n He made his own levels,\n\n3:12:22.780 --> 3:12:26.220\n as well as we worked on sound design systems\n\n3:12:26.220 --> 3:12:29.280\n on top of actually being a really good programmer.\n\n3:12:29.280 --> 3:12:32.020\n And we went through a little,\n\n3:12:32.020 --> 3:12:34.120\n it was kind of fun where one of the early things\n\n3:12:34.120 --> 3:12:36.520\n that we did where there was kind of the young buck bit\n\n3:12:36.520 --> 3:12:39.140\n going in where I was the new guy.\n\n3:12:39.140 --> 3:12:44.140\n And he was the top man programmer at the soft disk area.\n\n3:12:44.500 --> 3:12:47.100\n And eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend\n\n3:12:47.100 --> 3:12:49.640\n that we were gonna like race to implement this game,\n\n3:12:49.640 --> 3:12:52.780\n to port one of our PC games back down to the Apple II.\n\n3:12:52.780 --> 3:12:55.180\n And that was where we finally kind of became clear.\n\n3:12:55.180 --> 3:12:57.700\n It's like, okay, Carmack stands a little bit apart\n\n3:12:57.700 --> 3:13:00.260\n on the programming side of things.\n\n3:13:00.260 --> 3:13:03.060\n But Romero then very gracefully moved into,\n\n3:13:03.060 --> 3:13:06.100\n well, he'll work on the tools, he'll work on the systems,\n\n3:13:06.100 --> 3:13:07.620\n do some of the game design stuff,\n\n3:13:07.620 --> 3:13:09.740\n as well as contributing on,\n\n3:13:09.740 --> 3:13:12.880\n starting to lead the design aspects of a lot of things.\n\n3:13:12.880 --> 3:13:16.940\n So he was enormously valuable in the early stuff.\n\n3:13:16.940 --> 3:13:20.540\n And so much of Doom and even Quake have his stamp on it\n\n3:13:20.540 --> 3:13:21.900\n in a lot of ways.\n\n3:13:21.900 --> 3:13:25.640\n But he wasn't at the same level of focus\n\n3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:29.160\n that I brought to the work that we were doing there.\n\n3:13:29.160 --> 3:13:33.540\n And he really did, we hit such a degree of success\n\n3:13:33.540 --> 3:13:35.980\n that it was all in the press about that.\n\n3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:38.540\n The rockstar game programmers.\n\n3:13:38.540 --> 3:13:40.060\n I mean, it's the Beatles problem.\n\n3:13:40.060 --> 3:13:43.340\n Yeah, I mean, he ate it up and he did personify.\n\n3:13:43.340 --> 3:13:46.660\n There was the whole game developers with Ferraris\n\n3:13:46.660 --> 3:13:49.020\n that we had there.\n\n3:13:49.020 --> 3:13:53.520\n And I thought that led to some challenges there.\n\n3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:58.100\n But so much of the stuff that was great in the games\n\n3:13:58.100 --> 3:13:59.260\n did come from him.\n\n3:13:59.260 --> 3:14:01.940\n And I would certainly not take that away from him.\n\n3:14:01.940 --> 3:14:05.500\n And even after we parted ways and he took his swing\n\n3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:09.260\n with Eidos, in some ways, he was ahead of the curve\n\n3:14:09.260 --> 3:14:11.820\n with mobile gaming as well, where\n\n3:14:11.820 --> 3:14:15.540\n one of his companies after Eidos was working on feature phone\n\n3:14:15.540 --> 3:14:16.740\n game development.\n\n3:14:16.740 --> 3:14:19.300\n And I wound up doing some of that\n\n3:14:19.300 --> 3:14:22.300\n just before the iPhone crossing over into the iPhone phase\n\n3:14:22.300 --> 3:14:23.020\n there.\n\n3:14:23.020 --> 3:14:24.900\n And that was something that clearly\n\n3:14:24.900 --> 3:14:27.700\n did turn out to be a huge thing, although he\n\n3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:31.660\n was too early for what he was working on at that time.\n\n3:14:31.660 --> 3:14:34.060\n We've had pretty cordial relationships\n\n3:14:34.060 --> 3:14:35.980\n where I was happy to talk with him any time I'd\n\n3:14:35.980 --> 3:14:38.180\n run into him at a conference.\n\n3:14:38.180 --> 3:14:40.580\n I have actually had some other people just say,\n\n3:14:40.580 --> 3:14:42.940\n it's like, oh, you shouldn't go over there\n\n3:14:42.940 --> 3:14:44.380\n and give him the time of day.\n\n3:14:44.380 --> 3:14:50.940\n Or felt that Masters of Doom played things up in a way\n\n3:14:50.940 --> 3:14:52.500\n that I shouldn't be too happy with.\n\n3:14:52.500 --> 3:14:54.740\n But I'm OK with all of that.\n\n3:14:54.740 --> 3:14:56.700\n So you've still got love in your heart.\n\n3:14:56.700 --> 3:14:59.700\n Yeah, I mean, I just talked with him like last year,\n\n3:14:59.700 --> 3:15:01.060\n or I guess it was even this year,\n\n3:15:01.060 --> 3:15:03.820\n about mentioning that I'm going off doing this AI stuff.\n\n3:15:03.820 --> 3:15:06.580\n I'm going big into artificial intelligence.\n\n3:15:06.580 --> 3:15:09.260\n And he had a bunch of ideas for how\n\n3:15:09.260 --> 3:15:10.940\n AI is going to play into gaming.\n\n3:15:10.940 --> 3:15:13.460\n And asked if I was interested in collaborating.\n\n3:15:13.460 --> 3:15:16.300\n And it's not in line with what I'm doing.\n\n3:15:16.300 --> 3:15:19.620\n But I do wish almost everyone the best.\n\n3:15:19.620 --> 3:15:21.660\n I mean, I know I may not have partnered\n\n3:15:21.660 --> 3:15:24.460\n on the best of terms with some people.\n\n3:15:24.460 --> 3:15:29.100\n But I was thrilled to see Tom Hall writing VR games now.\n\n3:15:29.100 --> 3:15:31.540\n He wrote, I'm working on a game called Demio, which\n\n3:15:31.540 --> 3:15:33.780\n is really an awesome VR game.\n\n3:15:33.780 --> 3:15:35.020\n It's like Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n3:15:35.020 --> 3:15:36.820\n We all used to play Dungeons and Dragons together.\n\n3:15:36.820 --> 3:15:37.900\n That was one of the things.\n\n3:15:37.900 --> 3:15:40.340\n That was what we did on Sundays in the early days.\n\n3:15:40.340 --> 3:15:42.220\n I would Dungeon Master, and they'd all play.\n\n3:15:42.220 --> 3:15:44.980\n And so it really made me smile seeing\n\n3:15:44.980 --> 3:15:49.740\n Tom involved with an RPG game in virtual reality.\n\n3:15:49.740 --> 3:15:54.620\n You were the CTO of Oculus VR since 2013,\n\n3:15:54.620 --> 3:16:00.420\n and maybe less than a year involved in a bit in 2019.\n\n3:16:00.420 --> 3:16:04.900\n Oculus was acquired by Facebook Now Meta in 2014.\n\n3:16:04.900 --> 3:16:07.780\n You've spoken brilliantly about both the low level details,\n\n3:16:07.780 --> 3:16:09.780\n the experimental design, and the big picture\n\n3:16:09.780 --> 3:16:12.020\n vision of virtual reality.\n\n3:16:12.020 --> 3:16:14.980\n Let me ask you about the metaverse, the big question\n\n3:16:14.980 --> 3:16:18.020\n here, both philosophically and technically.\n\n3:16:18.020 --> 3:16:20.180\n How hard is it to build the metaverse?\n\n3:16:20.180 --> 3:16:22.700\n What is the metaverse in your view?\n\n3:16:22.700 --> 3:16:24.980\n You started with discussing and thinking about Quake\n\n3:16:24.980 --> 3:16:27.260\n as a kind of a metaverse.\n\n3:16:27.260 --> 3:16:31.340\n As you think about it today, what is the metaverse,\n\n3:16:31.340 --> 3:16:34.420\n the thing that could create this compelling user value,\n\n3:16:34.420 --> 3:16:36.860\n this experience that will change the world,\n\n3:16:36.860 --> 3:16:39.020\n and how hard is it to build it?\n\n3:16:39.020 --> 3:16:42.020\n So the term comes from Neal Stephenson's book Snow Crash,\n\n3:16:42.020 --> 3:16:44.700\n which many of us had read back in the 90s.\n\n3:16:44.700 --> 3:16:47.500\n It was one of those kind of formative books.\n\n3:16:47.500 --> 3:16:53.100\n And there was this sense that the possibilities\n\n3:16:53.100 --> 3:16:56.100\n and kind of the freedom and unlimited capabilities\n\n3:16:56.100 --> 3:16:59.540\n to build a virtual world that does whatever you want,\n\n3:16:59.540 --> 3:17:02.260\n whatever you ask of it, has been a powerful draw\n\n3:17:02.260 --> 3:17:05.620\n for generations of developers, game developers specifically,\n\n3:17:05.620 --> 3:17:08.900\n and people that are thinking about more general purpose\n\n3:17:08.900 --> 3:17:10.300\n applications.\n\n3:17:10.300 --> 3:17:13.660\n So we were talking about that back in the Doom and Quake days\n\n3:17:13.660 --> 3:17:17.140\n about how do you wind up with an interconnected set of worlds\n\n3:17:17.140 --> 3:17:19.180\n that you kind of visit from one to another.\n\n3:17:19.180 --> 3:17:21.540\n And as web pages were becoming a thing,\n\n3:17:21.540 --> 3:17:25.260\n you start thinking about what is the interactive kind\n\n3:17:25.260 --> 3:17:27.540\n of 3D based equivalent of this.\n\n3:17:27.540 --> 3:17:29.780\n And there were a lot of really bad takes.\n\n3:17:29.780 --> 3:17:34.220\n You had like Vermol and virtual reality markup languages.\n\n3:17:34.220 --> 3:17:38.300\n And there's aspects like that that came from people saying,\n\n3:17:38.300 --> 3:17:40.780\n well, what kind of capabilities should we\n\n3:17:40.780 --> 3:17:43.580\n develop to enable this?\n\n3:17:43.580 --> 3:17:45.620\n And that kind of capability first work\n\n3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:48.940\n has usually not panned out very well.\n\n3:17:48.940 --> 3:17:51.540\n On the other hand, we have successful games\n\n3:17:51.540 --> 3:17:54.340\n that started with things like Doom and Quake and communities\n\n3:17:54.340 --> 3:17:56.820\n that formed around those, whether it\n\n3:17:56.820 --> 3:17:58.700\n was server lists in the early days\n\n3:17:58.700 --> 3:18:01.580\n or literal portaling between different games,\n\n3:18:01.580 --> 3:18:04.780\n and then modern things that are on completely different order\n\n3:18:04.780 --> 3:18:07.380\n of magnitude like Minecraft and Fortnite that\n\n3:18:07.380 --> 3:18:11.820\n have 100 million plus users.\n\n3:18:11.820 --> 3:18:13.700\n I still think that that's the right way\n\n3:18:13.700 --> 3:18:16.900\n to go to build the metaverse is you build something that's\n\n3:18:16.900 --> 3:18:18.980\n amazing that people love and people wind up\n\n3:18:18.980 --> 3:18:21.940\n spending all their time in because it's awesome.\n\n3:18:21.940 --> 3:18:24.420\n And you expand the capabilities of that.\n\n3:18:24.420 --> 3:18:28.420\n So even if it's a very basic experience, if it's awesome.\n\n3:18:28.420 --> 3:18:31.660\n Minecraft is an amazing case study in so many things.\n\n3:18:31.660 --> 3:18:32.660\n That's basic as it gets.\n\n3:18:32.660 --> 3:18:36.860\n What's been able to be done with that is really enlightening.\n\n3:18:36.860 --> 3:18:39.700\n And there are other cases where, like right now,\n\n3:18:39.700 --> 3:18:43.260\n Roblox is basically a game construction kit aimed at kids.\n\n3:18:43.260 --> 3:18:45.020\n And that was a capability first play.\n\n3:18:45.020 --> 3:18:48.060\n And it's achieving scale that's on the same order\n\n3:18:48.060 --> 3:18:49.060\n of those things.\n\n3:18:49.060 --> 3:18:52.580\n So it's not impossible, but my preferred bet\n\n3:18:52.580 --> 3:18:55.180\n would be you make something amazing that people love\n\n3:18:55.180 --> 3:18:56.820\n and you make it better and better.\n\n3:18:56.820 --> 3:18:59.620\n And that's where I could say we could have gone back\n\n3:18:59.620 --> 3:19:02.780\n and followed a path like that in the early days\n\n3:19:02.780 --> 3:19:05.580\n if you just take the same game, whether it's\n\n3:19:05.580 --> 3:19:07.620\n when Activision demonstrated that you could make\n\n3:19:07.620 --> 3:19:09.140\n Call of Duty every year.\n\n3:19:09.140 --> 3:19:12.140\n And not only is it not bad, people love it.\n\n3:19:12.140 --> 3:19:14.460\n And it's very profitable.\n\n3:19:14.460 --> 3:19:17.340\n The idea that you could have taken something like that,\n\n3:19:17.340 --> 3:19:20.220\n take a great game, release a new version every year\n\n3:19:20.220 --> 3:19:23.020\n that lets the capabilities grow and expand\n\n3:19:23.020 --> 3:19:24.660\n to start saying it's like, OK, it's\n\n3:19:24.660 --> 3:19:26.780\n a game about running around and shooting things,\n\n3:19:26.780 --> 3:19:30.260\n but now you can bring your media into it.\n\n3:19:30.260 --> 3:19:35.020\n You can add persistence of social signs of life\n\n3:19:35.020 --> 3:19:37.820\n or whatever you want to add to it.\n\n3:19:37.820 --> 3:19:41.860\n I still think that's quite a good position to take.\n\n3:19:41.860 --> 3:19:45.940\n And I think that while Meta is doing a bottoms up capability\n\n3:19:45.940 --> 3:19:48.740\n approach with Horizon Worlds where it's\n\n3:19:48.740 --> 3:19:51.180\n a fairly general purpose, creators\n\n3:19:51.180 --> 3:19:55.180\n can build whatever they want in their sort of thing,\n\n3:19:55.180 --> 3:19:57.980\n it's hard to compare and compete with something\n\n3:19:57.980 --> 3:20:01.660\n like Fortnite, which also has enormous amounts of creativity\n\n3:20:01.660 --> 3:20:03.660\n even though it was not designed originally\n\n3:20:03.660 --> 3:20:05.740\n as a general purpose sort of thing.\n\n3:20:05.740 --> 3:20:08.500\n So we have examples on both sides.\n\n3:20:08.500 --> 3:20:11.940\n Me personally, I would have bet on trying\n\n3:20:11.940 --> 3:20:15.180\n to do entertainment, valuable destination first,\n\n3:20:15.180 --> 3:20:16.980\n and expanding from there.\n\n3:20:16.980 --> 3:20:22.180\n So can you imagine the thing that will be kind of,\n\n3:20:22.180 --> 3:20:25.300\n if we look back a couple of centuries from now\n\n3:20:25.300 --> 3:20:29.180\n and you think about the experiences that\n\n3:20:29.180 --> 3:20:34.500\n marked the singularity, the transition where most\n\n3:20:34.500 --> 3:20:37.660\n of our world moved into virtual reality,\n\n3:20:37.660 --> 3:20:40.580\n what do you think those experiences will look like?\n\n3:20:40.580 --> 3:20:43.620\n So I do think it's going to be kind of like the way the web\n\n3:20:43.620 --> 3:20:46.620\n slowly took over, where you're the frog\n\n3:20:46.620 --> 3:20:48.860\n in the pot of water that's slowly heating up,\n\n3:20:48.860 --> 3:20:51.420\n where having lived through all of that,\n\n3:20:51.420 --> 3:20:53.660\n I remember when it was shocking to start\n\n3:20:53.660 --> 3:20:57.260\n seeing the first website address on a billboard when you're\n\n3:20:57.260 --> 3:21:00.700\n like, hey, my computer world is infecting the real world.\n\n3:21:00.700 --> 3:21:03.100\n This is spreading out in some way.\n\n3:21:03.100 --> 3:21:05.620\n But when you look back and say, well,\n\n3:21:05.620 --> 3:21:08.260\n what made the web take off?\n\n3:21:08.260 --> 3:21:12.020\n And it wasn't a big bang sort of moment there.\n\n3:21:12.020 --> 3:21:14.540\n It was a bunch of little things that turned out\n\n3:21:14.540 --> 3:21:17.220\n not to even be the things that are relevant now\n\n3:21:17.220 --> 3:21:18.740\n that brought them into it.\n\n3:21:18.740 --> 3:21:23.140\n So I wonder if, I mean, like you said, you're not a historian.\n\n3:21:23.140 --> 3:21:26.580\n So maybe there is a historian out there\n\n3:21:26.580 --> 3:21:30.660\n that could really identify that moment, data driven way.\n\n3:21:30.660 --> 3:21:33.580\n It could be like MySpace or something like that.\n\n3:21:33.580 --> 3:21:37.340\n Maybe the first major social network that really reached\n\n3:21:37.340 --> 3:21:42.180\n into non geek world or something like that.\n\n3:21:42.180 --> 3:21:45.100\n I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians, though,\n\n3:21:45.100 --> 3:21:48.660\n looking for some of those kind of primary dominant causes\n\n3:21:48.660 --> 3:21:51.620\n where so many of these things are like we\n\n3:21:51.620 --> 3:21:52.980\n see an exponential curve.\n\n3:21:52.980 --> 3:21:55.900\n But it's not because like one thing is going exponential.\n\n3:21:55.900 --> 3:21:59.100\n It's because we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves\n\n3:21:59.100 --> 3:22:00.780\n overlapped on top of each other.\n\n3:22:00.780 --> 3:22:02.460\n And they just happen to keep adding up\n\n3:22:02.460 --> 3:22:05.540\n so that you've got something kind of going exponential\n\n3:22:05.540 --> 3:22:06.420\n at any given point.\n\n3:22:06.420 --> 3:22:09.300\n But no single one of them was the critical thing.\n\n3:22:09.300 --> 3:22:11.700\n There were dozens and dozens of things.\n\n3:22:11.700 --> 3:22:13.420\n I mean, seeing the transitions of stuff\n\n3:22:13.420 --> 3:22:16.580\n like as obviously MySpace giving way to other things,\n\n3:22:16.580 --> 3:22:20.180\n but even like blogging giving way to social media\n\n3:22:20.180 --> 3:22:22.860\n and getting resurrected in other guises.\n\n3:22:22.860 --> 3:22:26.060\n And the memes with the dancing baby GIF\n\n3:22:26.060 --> 3:22:29.140\n or whatever the all your base now belong to us.\n\n3:22:29.140 --> 3:22:32.300\n Whatever those early memes that led to the modern memes\n\n3:22:32.300 --> 3:22:37.260\n and the different evolution of humor on the internet\n\n3:22:37.260 --> 3:22:40.700\n that I'm sure the historians will also write books about\n\n3:22:40.700 --> 3:22:42.620\n from the different website that support\n\n3:22:42.620 --> 3:22:45.100\n to create the infrastructure for that humor like Reddit\n\n3:22:45.100 --> 3:22:46.860\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:22:46.860 --> 3:22:48.820\n So people will go back, and they will name\n\n3:22:48.820 --> 3:22:50.340\n firsts and critical moments.\n\n3:22:50.340 --> 3:22:53.420\n But it's probably going to be a poor approximation of what\n\n3:22:53.420 --> 3:22:54.900\n actually happens.\n\n3:22:54.900 --> 3:22:57.500\n And we've already seen in the VR space\n\n3:22:57.500 --> 3:23:01.380\n where it didn't play out the way we thought it would in terms\n\n3:23:01.380 --> 3:23:04.620\n of what was going to be like when the modern era of VR\n\n3:23:04.620 --> 3:23:07.260\n basically started with my E3 demo of Doom 3\n\n3:23:07.260 --> 3:23:08.460\n on the Rift prototype.\n\n3:23:08.460 --> 3:23:10.980\n So we're like first person shooters in VR,\n\n3:23:10.980 --> 3:23:12.860\n match made in heaven, right?\n\n3:23:12.860 --> 3:23:15.500\n And that didn't work out that way at all.\n\n3:23:15.500 --> 3:23:18.420\n They have the most comfort problems with it.\n\n3:23:18.420 --> 3:23:21.220\n And then the most popular virtual reality app\n\n3:23:21.220 --> 3:23:24.820\n is Beat Saber, which nobody predicted back then.\n\n3:23:24.820 --> 3:23:28.740\n What's that make you like from first principles\n\n3:23:28.740 --> 3:23:31.300\n if you were to reverse engineer that?\n\n3:23:31.300 --> 3:23:35.340\n Why are these silly fun games the most?\n\n3:23:35.340 --> 3:23:37.340\n It actually makes very clear sense\n\n3:23:37.340 --> 3:23:40.420\n when you analyze it from hindsight\n\n3:23:40.420 --> 3:23:41.900\n and look at the engineering reasons\n\n3:23:41.900 --> 3:23:45.380\n where it's not just that it was a magical quirky idea.\n\n3:23:45.380 --> 3:23:47.820\n It was something that played almost perfectly\n\n3:23:47.820 --> 3:23:50.460\n to what turned out to be the real strengths of VR\n\n3:23:50.460 --> 3:23:52.940\n where the one thing that I really underestimated\n\n3:23:52.940 --> 3:23:55.940\n importance in VR was the importance of the controllers.\n\n3:23:55.940 --> 3:23:57.700\n I was still thinking we could do a lot more\n\n3:23:57.700 --> 3:24:00.500\n with the game pad and just the amazingness\n\n3:24:00.500 --> 3:24:01.940\n of taking any existing game,\n\n3:24:01.940 --> 3:24:04.300\n being able to move your head around and look around,\n\n3:24:04.300 --> 3:24:06.180\n that that was really amazing.\n\n3:24:06.180 --> 3:24:09.020\n But the controllers were super important.\n\n3:24:09.020 --> 3:24:10.420\n But the problem is so many things\n\n3:24:10.420 --> 3:24:13.420\n that you do with the controllers just suck.\n\n3:24:13.420 --> 3:24:14.700\n It feels like it breaks the illusion\n\n3:24:14.700 --> 3:24:16.900\n like trying to pick up glasses with the controllers\n\n3:24:16.900 --> 3:24:18.540\n where you're like, oh, use the grip button\n\n3:24:18.540 --> 3:24:21.420\n when you're kind of close and it'll snap into your hand.\n\n3:24:21.420 --> 3:24:24.540\n All of those things are unnatural actions\n\n3:24:24.540 --> 3:24:27.660\n that you do them and it's still part of the VR experience.\n\n3:24:27.660 --> 3:24:32.460\n But Beat Saber winds up playing only to the strengths.\n\n3:24:32.460 --> 3:24:34.620\n It completely hides all the weaknesses of it\n\n3:24:34.620 --> 3:24:37.100\n because you are holding something in your hand.\n\n3:24:37.100 --> 3:24:39.340\n You keep a solid grip on it the whole time.\n\n3:24:39.340 --> 3:24:42.300\n It slices through things without ever bumping into things.\n\n3:24:42.300 --> 3:24:44.420\n You never get into the point where,\n\n3:24:44.420 --> 3:24:45.660\n I'm knocking on this table,\n\n3:24:45.660 --> 3:24:48.060\n but in VR, my hand just goes right through it.\n\n3:24:48.060 --> 3:24:51.060\n So you've got something that slices through.\n\n3:24:51.060 --> 3:24:53.100\n So it's never your brain telling you,\n\n3:24:53.100 --> 3:24:54.540\n oh, I should have hit something.\n\n3:24:54.540 --> 3:24:55.780\n You've got a lightsaber here.\n\n3:24:55.780 --> 3:24:58.980\n It's just, you expect it to slice through everything.\n\n3:24:58.980 --> 3:25:02.460\n Audio and music turned out to be a really powerful aspect\n\n3:25:02.460 --> 3:25:05.180\n of virtual reality where you're blocking the world off\n\n3:25:05.180 --> 3:25:07.580\n and constructing the world around you.\n\n3:25:07.580 --> 3:25:10.900\n And being something that can run efficiently\n\n3:25:10.900 --> 3:25:13.700\n on even this relatively low powered hardware\n\n3:25:13.700 --> 3:25:17.660\n and can have a valuable loop in a small amount of time\n\n3:25:17.660 --> 3:25:19.500\n where a lot of modern games,\n\n3:25:19.500 --> 3:25:21.460\n you're supposed to sit down and play it for an hour\n\n3:25:21.460 --> 3:25:22.300\n just to get anywhere.\n\n3:25:22.300 --> 3:25:23.660\n Sometimes a new game takes an hour\n\n3:25:23.660 --> 3:25:25.340\n to get through the tutorial level.\n\n3:25:25.340 --> 3:25:27.860\n And that's not good for VR for a couple reasons.\n\n3:25:27.860 --> 3:25:29.700\n You do still have the comfort issues\n\n3:25:29.700 --> 3:25:31.460\n if you're moving around at all,\n\n3:25:31.460 --> 3:25:34.780\n but you've also got just discomfort from the headset,\n\n3:25:34.780 --> 3:25:37.500\n battery lifespan on the mobile versions.\n\n3:25:37.500 --> 3:25:39.140\n So having things that do break down\n\n3:25:39.140 --> 3:25:42.140\n into three and four minute windows of play,\n\n3:25:42.140 --> 3:25:43.780\n that turns out to be very valuable\n\n3:25:43.780 --> 3:25:45.780\n from a gameplay standpoint.\n\n3:25:45.780 --> 3:25:48.180\n So it winds up being kind of a perfect storm\n\n3:25:48.180 --> 3:25:50.060\n of all of these things that are really good.\n\n3:25:50.060 --> 3:25:52.060\n It doesn't have any of the comfort problems.\n\n3:25:52.060 --> 3:25:53.380\n You're not navigating around.\n\n3:25:53.380 --> 3:25:54.620\n You're standing still.\n\n3:25:54.620 --> 3:25:56.580\n All the stuff flies at you.\n\n3:25:56.580 --> 3:25:59.380\n It has placed audio strengths.\n\n3:25:59.380 --> 3:26:01.580\n It adds the whole fitness in VR.\n\n3:26:01.580 --> 3:26:04.460\n Nobody was thinking about that back at the beginning.\n\n3:26:04.460 --> 3:26:07.420\n And it turns out that that is an excellent\n\n3:26:07.420 --> 3:26:09.060\n daily fitness thing to be doing.\n\n3:26:09.060 --> 3:26:11.860\n If you go play an hour of Beat Saber\n\n3:26:11.860 --> 3:26:13.500\n or Supernatural or something,\n\n3:26:13.500 --> 3:26:16.420\n that is legit solid exercise.\n\n3:26:16.420 --> 3:26:17.980\n And it's more fun than doing it\n\n3:26:17.980 --> 3:26:19.900\n just about any other way there.\n\n3:26:19.900 --> 3:26:23.460\n So that's kind of the arcade stage of things.\n\n3:26:23.460 --> 3:26:27.140\n If I were to say with my experience with VR,\n\n3:26:27.140 --> 3:26:30.620\n the thing that I think is powerful is the,\n\n3:26:30.620 --> 3:26:32.580\n maybe it's not here yet,\n\n3:26:32.580 --> 3:26:35.100\n but the degree to which it is immersive\n\n3:26:35.100 --> 3:26:38.380\n in the way that Quake is immersive.\n\n3:26:38.380 --> 3:26:40.260\n It takes you to another world.\n\n3:26:40.260 --> 3:26:43.060\n For me, because I'm a fan of role playing games,\n\n3:26:44.340 --> 3:26:47.140\n the Elder Scrolls series,\n\n3:26:47.140 --> 3:26:50.180\n like Skyrim or even Daggerfall,\n\n3:26:50.180 --> 3:26:52.540\n it just takes you to another world.\n\n3:26:52.540 --> 3:26:53.940\n And when you're not in that world,\n\n3:26:53.940 --> 3:26:55.860\n you miss not being there.\n\n3:26:55.860 --> 3:26:58.820\n And then you just, you kind of want to stay there forever\n\n3:26:58.820 --> 3:27:00.940\n because life is shitty.\n\n3:27:00.940 --> 3:27:04.300\n And you just want to go to this place.\n\n3:27:04.300 --> 3:27:09.300\n Is that there was a time when we were kind of asked\n\n3:27:09.340 --> 3:27:12.060\n to come up with like, what's your view about VR?\n\n3:27:12.060 --> 3:27:15.620\n And my pitch was that it should be better\n\n3:27:15.620 --> 3:27:17.220\n inside the headset than outside.\n\n3:27:17.220 --> 3:27:19.460\n It's the world as you want it.\n\n3:27:19.460 --> 3:27:21.660\n And everybody thought that was dystopian.\n\n3:27:21.660 --> 3:27:23.300\n And like, that's like, oh,\n\n3:27:23.300 --> 3:27:25.580\n you're just going to forget about the world outside.\n\n3:27:25.580 --> 3:27:29.700\n And I don't get that mindset where the idea\n\n3:27:29.700 --> 3:27:32.860\n that if you can make the world better inside the headset\n\n3:27:32.860 --> 3:27:36.220\n than outside, you've just improved the person's life\n\n3:27:36.220 --> 3:27:38.500\n that has a headset that can wear it.\n\n3:27:38.500 --> 3:27:41.300\n And there are plenty of things that we just can't do\n\n3:27:41.300 --> 3:27:42.380\n for everyone in the real world.\n\n3:27:42.380 --> 3:27:44.900\n Everybody can't have Richard Branson's Private Island,\n\n3:27:44.900 --> 3:27:47.180\n but everyone can have a private VR Island\n\n3:27:47.180 --> 3:27:49.100\n and it can have the things that they want on it.\n\n3:27:49.100 --> 3:27:51.620\n And there's a lot of these kind of rivalrous goods\n\n3:27:51.620 --> 3:27:55.580\n in the real world that VR can just be better at.\n\n3:27:55.580 --> 3:27:57.740\n We can do a lot of things like that\n\n3:27:57.740 --> 3:27:59.620\n that can be very, very rich.\n\n3:27:59.620 --> 3:28:01.020\n So yeah, I want the,\n\n3:28:01.020 --> 3:28:02.380\n I think it's going to be a positive thing,\n\n3:28:02.380 --> 3:28:05.420\n this world where people want to go back into their headset,\n\n3:28:05.420 --> 3:28:07.980\n where it can be better than somebody that's living\n\n3:28:07.980 --> 3:28:10.860\n in a tiny apartment can have a palatial estate\n\n3:28:10.860 --> 3:28:11.980\n in virtual reality.\n\n3:28:11.980 --> 3:28:13.940\n They can have all their friends from all over the world\n\n3:28:13.940 --> 3:28:16.620\n come over and visit them without everybody getting\n\n3:28:16.620 --> 3:28:19.300\n on a plane and meeting in some place\n\n3:28:19.300 --> 3:28:21.620\n and dealing with all the other logistics hassles.\n\n3:28:21.620 --> 3:28:25.460\n There is real value in the presence that you can get\n\n3:28:25.460 --> 3:28:26.540\n for remote meetings.\n\n3:28:26.540 --> 3:28:30.100\n It's all the little things that we need to sort out,\n\n3:28:30.100 --> 3:28:32.860\n but those are things that we have line of sight on.\n\n3:28:32.860 --> 3:28:35.980\n People that have been in like a good VR meeting\n\n3:28:35.980 --> 3:28:38.180\n using work rooms where you can say,\n\n3:28:38.180 --> 3:28:40.380\n oh, that was better than a Zoom meeting.\n\n3:28:40.380 --> 3:28:42.900\n But of course it's more of a hassle to get into it.\n\n3:28:42.900 --> 3:28:44.380\n Not everyone has the headset.\n\n3:28:44.380 --> 3:28:46.260\n Interoperability is worse.\n\n3:28:46.260 --> 3:28:48.620\n You can't have, you cap out at a certain number.\n\n3:28:48.620 --> 3:28:50.620\n There's all these things that need to be fixed,\n\n3:28:50.620 --> 3:28:52.340\n but that's one of those things you can look at and say,\n\n3:28:52.340 --> 3:28:54.220\n we know there's value there.\n\n3:28:54.220 --> 3:28:56.300\n We just need to really grind hard,\n\n3:28:56.300 --> 3:28:59.460\n file off all the rough edges and make that possible.\n\n3:28:59.460 --> 3:29:02.020\n So you do think we have line of sight\n\n3:29:02.020 --> 3:29:06.020\n because there's a reason like,\n\n3:29:06.980 --> 3:29:09.500\n I do this podcast in person, for example.\n\n3:29:09.500 --> 3:29:14.060\n So doing it remotely, it's not the same.\n\n3:29:14.060 --> 3:29:16.940\n And if somebody were to ask me why it's not the same,\n\n3:29:16.940 --> 3:29:19.220\n I wouldn't be able to write down exactly why.\n\n3:29:20.540 --> 3:29:23.380\n But you're saying that it's possible,\n\n3:29:23.380 --> 3:29:26.980\n whatever the magic is for in person interaction,\n\n3:29:26.980 --> 3:29:30.500\n that immersiveness of the experience,\n\n3:29:30.500 --> 3:29:32.180\n we are almost there.\n\n3:29:32.180 --> 3:29:34.380\n Yes, so the idea of like,\n\n3:29:34.380 --> 3:29:37.700\n I'm doing a VR interview with someone.\n\n3:29:37.700 --> 3:29:39.580\n I'm not saying it's here right now,\n\n3:29:39.580 --> 3:29:42.620\n but you can see glimmers of what it should be.\n\n3:29:42.620 --> 3:29:46.020\n And we largely know what would need to be fixed\n\n3:29:46.020 --> 3:29:48.020\n and improved to, like you say,\n\n3:29:48.020 --> 3:29:50.580\n there's a difference between at remote interview\n\n3:29:50.580 --> 3:29:53.900\n doing a podcast over Zoom or something and face to face.\n\n3:29:53.900 --> 3:29:56.460\n There's that sense of presence, that immediacy,\n\n3:29:56.460 --> 3:29:59.060\n the super low latency responsiveness,\n\n3:29:59.060 --> 3:30:01.420\n being able to see all the subtle things there,\n\n3:30:01.420 --> 3:30:03.700\n just occupying the same field of view.\n\n3:30:03.700 --> 3:30:04.860\n And all of those are things\n\n3:30:04.860 --> 3:30:07.740\n that we absolutely can do in VR.\n\n3:30:07.740 --> 3:30:10.460\n And that simple case of a small meeting\n\n3:30:10.460 --> 3:30:13.020\n with a couple of people, that's the much easier case\n\n3:30:13.020 --> 3:30:15.260\n than everybody thinks the Ready Player One multiverse\n\n3:30:15.260 --> 3:30:18.420\n with a thousand people going across a huge bridge\n\n3:30:18.420 --> 3:30:20.020\n to amazing places,\n\n3:30:20.020 --> 3:30:22.420\n that's harder in a lot of other technical ways.\n\n3:30:22.420 --> 3:30:24.100\n Not to say we can't also do that,\n\n3:30:24.100 --> 3:30:26.540\n but that's further away and has more challenges.\n\n3:30:26.540 --> 3:30:29.620\n But this small thing about being able to have a meeting\n\n3:30:29.620 --> 3:30:33.820\n with one or a few people and have it feel real,\n\n3:30:33.820 --> 3:30:35.500\n feel like you're there,\n\n3:30:35.500 --> 3:30:37.900\n like you have the same interactions and talking with them,\n\n3:30:37.900 --> 3:30:40.420\n you get subtle cues as we start getting eye\n\n3:30:40.420 --> 3:30:42.260\n and face tracking and some of the other things\n\n3:30:42.260 --> 3:30:43.900\n on high end headsets.\n\n3:30:43.900 --> 3:30:46.340\n A lot of that is going to come over\n\n3:30:46.340 --> 3:30:49.100\n and it doesn't have to be as good.\n\n3:30:49.100 --> 3:30:51.060\n This is an important thing that people miss\n\n3:30:51.060 --> 3:30:54.060\n where there was a lot of people that,\n\n3:30:54.060 --> 3:30:57.140\n especially rich people that would look at VR and say,\n\n3:30:57.140 --> 3:30:59.780\n it's like, oh, this just isn't that good.\n\n3:30:59.780 --> 3:31:00.980\n And I'd say, it's like, well,\n\n3:31:00.980 --> 3:31:05.100\n you've already been courtside backstage and on pit row\n\n3:31:05.100 --> 3:31:06.980\n and you've done all of these experiences\n\n3:31:06.980 --> 3:31:08.740\n because you get to do them in real life.\n\n3:31:08.740 --> 3:31:10.660\n But most people don't get to.\n\n3:31:10.660 --> 3:31:13.380\n And even if the experience is only half as good,\n\n3:31:13.380 --> 3:31:15.020\n if it's something that they never would have gotten\n\n3:31:15.020 --> 3:31:17.780\n to do before, it's still a very good thing.\n\n3:31:17.780 --> 3:31:20.900\n And as we can just, we can push that number up over time.\n\n3:31:20.900 --> 3:31:24.140\n It has a minimum viable value level\n\n3:31:24.140 --> 3:31:27.220\n when it does something that is valuable enough to people,\n\n3:31:27.220 --> 3:31:29.980\n as long as it's better inside the headset on any metric\n\n3:31:29.980 --> 3:31:32.620\n than it is outside and people choose to go there,\n\n3:31:32.620 --> 3:31:33.980\n we're on the right path.\n\n3:31:33.980 --> 3:31:35.580\n And we have a value gradient\n\n3:31:35.580 --> 3:31:37.100\n that I'm just always hammering on.\n\n3:31:37.100 --> 3:31:39.060\n We can just follow this value gradient,\n\n3:31:39.060 --> 3:31:41.020\n just keep making things better\n\n3:31:41.020 --> 3:31:44.540\n rather than going for that one, close your eyes,\n\n3:31:44.540 --> 3:31:48.740\n swing for the fences, kind of silver bullet approach.\n\n3:31:48.740 --> 3:31:50.500\n Well, I wonder if there's a value gradient\n\n3:31:50.500 --> 3:31:53.460\n for in person meetings, because if you get that right,\n\n3:31:53.460 --> 3:31:54.940\n I mean, that would change the world.\n\n3:31:54.940 --> 3:31:57.020\n Yeah. That it doesn't need to,\n\n3:31:57.020 --> 3:31:59.380\n I mean, you don't need a ready player one.\n\n3:31:59.380 --> 3:32:02.780\n But I wonder if there's that value gradient\n\n3:32:02.780 --> 3:32:07.780\n you can follow along, because if there is and you follow it,\n\n3:32:08.020 --> 3:32:11.500\n then there'll be a certain like phase shift\n\n3:32:11.500 --> 3:32:14.660\n at a certain point where people will shift\n\n3:32:14.660 --> 3:32:18.620\n from Zoom to this.\n\n3:32:18.620 --> 3:32:23.220\n I wonder, what are the bottlenecks?\n\n3:32:23.220 --> 3:32:25.380\n Is it software, is it hardware?\n\n3:32:25.380 --> 3:32:27.780\n Is it like, is it all about latency?\n\n3:32:27.780 --> 3:32:30.460\n So I have big arguments internally\n\n3:32:30.460 --> 3:32:32.740\n about strategic things like that,\n\n3:32:32.740 --> 3:32:36.700\n where like the next headset that's coming out\n\n3:32:36.700 --> 3:32:38.980\n that we've made various announcements about\n\n3:32:38.980 --> 3:32:40.460\n is gonna be a higher end headset,\n\n3:32:40.460 --> 3:32:41.980\n more expensive, more features.\n\n3:32:41.980 --> 3:32:45.500\n Lots of people wanna make those trade offs.\n\n3:32:45.500 --> 3:32:47.180\n We'll see what the market has to say\n\n3:32:47.180 --> 3:32:49.740\n about the exact trade offs we've made here.\n\n3:32:49.740 --> 3:32:51.420\n But if you wanna replace Zoom,\n\n3:32:51.420 --> 3:32:53.780\n you need to have something that everybody has.\n\n3:32:55.180 --> 3:32:56.420\n So you like cheaper.\n\n3:32:56.420 --> 3:33:00.140\n I like cheaper because also lighter and cheaper\n\n3:33:00.140 --> 3:33:03.300\n wind up being a virtuous cycle there\n\n3:33:03.300 --> 3:33:05.540\n where expensive and more features\n\n3:33:05.540 --> 3:33:07.220\n tends to also lead towards heavier.\n\n3:33:07.220 --> 3:33:09.620\n And it just kind of goes, it's like, let's add more features.\n\n3:33:09.620 --> 3:33:13.340\n The features are not, they have physical presence\n\n3:33:13.340 --> 3:33:16.100\n and weight and draw from batteries and all of those things.\n\n3:33:16.100 --> 3:33:21.100\n So I've always favored a lower end, cheaper, faster approach.\n\n3:33:21.340 --> 3:33:24.340\n That's why I was always behind the mobile side of VR\n\n3:33:24.340 --> 3:33:26.700\n rather than the higher end PC headsets.\n\n3:33:26.700 --> 3:33:29.460\n And I think that's proven out well.\n\n3:33:29.460 --> 3:33:32.900\n But there's, ideally we have a whole range of things,\n\n3:33:32.900 --> 3:33:35.380\n but if you've only got one or two things,\n\n3:33:35.380 --> 3:33:37.220\n it's important that those two things cover\n\n3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:40.580\n the scope that you think is most important.\n\n3:33:40.580 --> 3:33:42.500\n When we're in a world when it's like cell phones\n\n3:33:42.500 --> 3:33:44.020\n and there's 50 of them on the market\n\n3:33:44.020 --> 3:33:46.980\n covering every conceivable ecological niche you want,\n\n3:33:46.980 --> 3:33:47.940\n that's gonna be great,\n\n3:33:47.940 --> 3:33:49.940\n but we're not gonna be there for a while.\n\n3:33:49.940 --> 3:33:51.580\n Where are the bottlenecks?\n\n3:33:51.580 --> 3:33:53.380\n Is it the hardware or the software?\n\n3:33:53.380 --> 3:33:56.300\n Yeah, so right now you can play,\n\n3:33:56.300 --> 3:33:58.900\n you can get work rooms on Quest\n\n3:33:58.900 --> 3:34:00.340\n and you can set up these things\n\n3:34:00.340 --> 3:34:01.700\n and it's a pretty good experience.\n\n3:34:01.700 --> 3:34:02.700\n It's surprisingly good.\n\n3:34:02.700 --> 3:34:03.740\n I haven't tried it.\n\n3:34:03.740 --> 3:34:05.060\n It's surprisingly good.\n\n3:34:05.060 --> 3:34:08.100\n Yeah, the voice latency is better on that\n\n3:34:08.100 --> 3:34:10.140\n than a lot better than a Zoom meeting.\n\n3:34:10.140 --> 3:34:13.580\n So you've got a more, a better sense of immediacy there.\n\n3:34:13.580 --> 3:34:17.100\n The expressions that you get from the current hardware\n\n3:34:17.100 --> 3:34:20.060\n with just kind of your controllers and your head\n\n3:34:20.060 --> 3:34:21.580\n is pretty realistic feeling.\n\n3:34:21.580 --> 3:34:23.300\n You've got a pretty good sense of being there\n\n3:34:23.300 --> 3:34:24.140\n with someone with it.\n\n3:34:24.140 --> 3:34:27.500\n Are these like avatars of people?\n\n3:34:27.500 --> 3:34:28.340\n Yeah.\n\n3:34:28.340 --> 3:34:29.900\n Do you get to see their body?\n\n3:34:29.900 --> 3:34:30.940\n Yeah.\n\n3:34:30.940 --> 3:34:32.420\n And they're sitting around a table?\n\n3:34:32.420 --> 3:34:33.300\n Yeah.\n\n3:34:33.300 --> 3:34:35.660\n And it feels better than Zoom?\n\n3:34:35.660 --> 3:34:36.500\n It feels better than you, yeah,\n\n3:34:36.500 --> 3:34:37.780\n better than you'd expect for that.\n\n3:34:37.780 --> 3:34:42.180\n It is definitely, yeah, I'd say it's quite a bit better\n\n3:34:42.180 --> 3:34:43.860\n than Zoom when everything's working right,\n\n3:34:43.860 --> 3:34:46.420\n but there's still all the rough edges of,\n\n3:34:46.420 --> 3:34:48.220\n the reason Zoom became so successful\n\n3:34:48.220 --> 3:34:51.020\n is because they just nailed the usability of everything.\n\n3:34:51.020 --> 3:34:54.940\n It's high quality with a absolutely first rate experience.\n\n3:34:54.940 --> 3:34:58.020\n And we are not there yet with any of the VR stuff.\n\n3:34:58.020 --> 3:35:00.740\n I'm trying to push hard to get,\n\n3:35:00.740 --> 3:35:02.420\n I keep talking about it's like,\n\n3:35:02.420 --> 3:35:05.020\n it needs to just be one click to make everything happen.\n\n3:35:05.020 --> 3:35:07.620\n And we're getting there in our home environment,\n\n3:35:07.620 --> 3:35:09.260\n not the whole work rooms application,\n\n3:35:09.260 --> 3:35:11.740\n but the main home where you can now kind of go over\n\n3:35:11.740 --> 3:35:12.660\n and click and invite,\n\n3:35:12.660 --> 3:35:15.220\n and it still winds up taking five times longer\n\n3:35:15.220 --> 3:35:16.260\n than it should,\n\n3:35:16.260 --> 3:35:19.460\n but we're getting close to that where you click there,\n\n3:35:19.460 --> 3:35:22.020\n they click on their button and then they're sitting there\n\n3:35:22.020 --> 3:35:23.860\n in this good presence with you,\n\n3:35:23.860 --> 3:35:25.940\n but latencies need to get a lot better.\n\n3:35:25.940 --> 3:35:28.780\n User interface needs to get a lot better.\n\n3:35:28.780 --> 3:35:30.940\n Ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better.\n\n3:35:30.940 --> 3:35:33.780\n We need to have a hundred million of them out there\n\n3:35:33.780 --> 3:35:35.420\n just so that everybody knows somebody\n\n3:35:35.420 --> 3:35:37.260\n that uses this all the time.\n\n3:35:37.260 --> 3:35:38.540\n Well, I think it's a virtuous cycle\n\n3:35:38.540 --> 3:35:42.780\n because I do think the interface\n\n3:35:44.140 --> 3:35:48.140\n is the thing that makes or breaks this kind of revolution.\n\n3:35:48.140 --> 3:35:50.860\n It's so interesting how like you said one click,\n\n3:35:50.860 --> 3:35:53.980\n but it's also like how you achieve that one click.\n\n3:35:53.980 --> 3:35:54.820\n I don't know.\n\n3:35:54.820 --> 3:35:58.620\n What is, can I ask a dark question?\n\n3:35:58.620 --> 3:36:00.700\n Maybe let's keep it outside of meta,\n\n3:36:00.700 --> 3:36:05.020\n but this is about meta, but also Google and big company.\n\n3:36:05.020 --> 3:36:07.940\n Are they able to do this kind of thing?\n\n3:36:07.940 --> 3:36:12.180\n It seems like, let me put on my cranky old man hat,\n\n3:36:12.180 --> 3:36:15.660\n is they seem to not do a good job\n\n3:36:15.660 --> 3:36:20.500\n of creating these user friendly interfaces\n\n3:36:20.500 --> 3:36:22.900\n as they get bigger and bigger as a company.\n\n3:36:22.900 --> 3:36:25.980\n Like Google has created some of the greatest interfaces ever\n\n3:36:27.100 --> 3:36:30.300\n early on in its, I mean, creating Gmail,\n\n3:36:30.300 --> 3:36:33.820\n just so many brilliant interfaces\n\n3:36:33.820 --> 3:36:35.940\n and it just seems to be getting crappier\n\n3:36:35.940 --> 3:36:37.220\n and crappier at that.\n\n3:36:37.220 --> 3:36:42.180\n Same with meta, same with Microsoft.\n\n3:36:42.180 --> 3:36:45.020\n It's just, it seems to get worse and worse at that.\n\n3:36:45.020 --> 3:36:46.100\n I don't know what it is,\n\n3:36:46.100 --> 3:36:47.620\n because you've become more conservative,\n\n3:36:47.620 --> 3:36:49.980\n careful, risk averse.\n\n3:36:49.980 --> 3:36:51.140\n Is that why?\n\n3:36:51.140 --> 3:36:51.980\n Can you speak to that?\n\n3:36:51.980 --> 3:36:53.500\n It's been really eye opening to me\n\n3:36:53.500 --> 3:36:55.420\n working inside a tech titan,\n\n3:36:55.420 --> 3:36:59.460\n where I had my small companies\n\n3:36:59.460 --> 3:37:03.500\n and then we're acquired by a midsize game publisher\n\n3:37:03.500 --> 3:37:06.740\n and then Oculus getting acquired by meta\n\n3:37:06.740 --> 3:37:08.860\n and meta has grown by a factor of many\n\n3:37:08.860 --> 3:37:12.980\n just in the eight years since the acquisition.\n\n3:37:12.980 --> 3:37:16.260\n So I did not have experience with this\n\n3:37:16.260 --> 3:37:19.740\n and it was interesting because I remember like previously\n\n3:37:19.740 --> 3:37:23.020\n my benchmark for kind of use of resources\n\n3:37:23.020 --> 3:37:25.300\n was some of the government programs I interacted with\n\n3:37:25.300 --> 3:37:26.900\n on the aerospace side.\n\n3:37:26.900 --> 3:37:28.860\n And I remember thinking there was,\n\n3:37:28.860 --> 3:37:30.340\n okay, there's an air force program\n\n3:37:30.340 --> 3:37:34.340\n and they spent $50 million and they didn't launch anything.\n\n3:37:34.340 --> 3:37:35.500\n They didn't even build anything.\n\n3:37:35.500 --> 3:37:39.020\n It was just kind of like they made a bunch of papers\n\n3:37:39.020 --> 3:37:42.180\n and had some parts in a warehouse and nothing came of it.\n\n3:37:42.180 --> 3:37:47.180\n It's like $50 million and I've had to radically recalibrate\n\n3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:50.540\n my sense of like how much money can be spent\n\n3:37:50.540 --> 3:37:54.060\n with mediocre resources.\n\n3:37:54.060 --> 3:37:58.020\n Where on the plus side, VR has turned out,\n\n3:37:58.020 --> 3:38:02.260\n we've built pretty much exactly what,\n\n3:38:02.260 --> 3:38:03.900\n we just passed the 10 year mark then\n\n3:38:03.900 --> 3:38:06.940\n from like my first demo of the Rift.\n\n3:38:06.940 --> 3:38:09.580\n And if I could have said what I wanted to have,\n\n3:38:09.580 --> 3:38:12.860\n it would have been a standalone inside out tracked\n\n3:38:12.860 --> 3:38:15.820\n 4K resolution headset that I,\n\n3:38:15.820 --> 3:38:18.380\n that could still plug into a PC for high end rendering.\n\n3:38:18.380 --> 3:38:20.900\n And that's exactly what we've got on Quest 2 right now.\n\n3:38:20.900 --> 3:38:22.660\n Yes, first of all, let's pause on that\n\n3:38:22.660 --> 3:38:24.980\n with me being cranky and everything.\n\n3:38:24.980 --> 3:38:29.980\n It's what Meta achieved with Oculus and so on is incredible.\n\n3:38:30.180 --> 3:38:34.060\n I mean, this is, when I thought about the future of VR,\n\n3:38:34.060 --> 3:38:36.740\n this is what I imagined in terms of hardware, I would say.\n\n3:38:36.740 --> 3:38:39.260\n And maybe in terms of the experience as well,\n\n3:38:39.260 --> 3:38:42.100\n but it's still not there somehow.\n\n3:38:42.100 --> 3:38:44.620\n On the one hand, we did kind of achieve it and win.\n\n3:38:44.620 --> 3:38:48.140\n And we've got, we've sold, we're a success right now,\n\n3:38:48.140 --> 3:38:51.260\n but the amount of resources that have gone into it,\n\n3:38:51.260 --> 3:38:53.540\n it winds up getting cluttered up in accounting\n\n3:38:53.540 --> 3:38:58.380\n where Mark did announce that they spent $10 billion a year,\n\n3:38:58.380 --> 3:38:59.540\n like on Reality Labs.\n\n3:38:59.540 --> 3:39:01.740\n Now Reality Labs covers a lot.\n\n3:39:01.740 --> 3:39:04.300\n It was, VR was not the large part of it.\n\n3:39:04.300 --> 3:39:05.860\n It also had Portal and Spark\n\n3:39:05.860 --> 3:39:08.180\n and the big AR research efforts.\n\n3:39:08.180 --> 3:39:11.060\n And it's been expanding out to include AI\n\n3:39:11.060 --> 3:39:15.540\n and other things there where there's a lot going on there.\n\n3:39:15.540 --> 3:39:18.140\n But $10 billion was just a number\n\n3:39:18.140 --> 3:39:20.260\n that I had trouble processing.\n\n3:39:20.260 --> 3:39:22.460\n It's just, I feel sick to my stomach\n\n3:39:22.460 --> 3:39:24.980\n thinking about that much money being spent.\n\n3:39:24.980 --> 3:39:27.820\n But that's how they demonstrate commitment to this,\n\n3:39:27.820 --> 3:39:31.420\n where it's not more so than like, yeah,\n\n3:39:31.420 --> 3:39:34.100\n Google goes and cancels all of these projects,\n\n3:39:34.100 --> 3:39:36.060\n different things like that,\n\n3:39:36.060 --> 3:39:39.500\n while Meta is really sticking with the funding of VR\n\n3:39:39.500 --> 3:39:41.900\n and AR is still further out with it.\n\n3:39:41.900 --> 3:39:43.900\n So there's something to be said for that.\n\n3:39:44.780 --> 3:39:46.940\n It's not just gonna vanish, the work's going in.\n\n3:39:46.940 --> 3:39:48.740\n I just wish it could be,\n\n3:39:48.740 --> 3:39:51.740\n all those resources could be applied more effectively\n\n3:39:51.740 --> 3:39:53.740\n because I see all these cases.\n\n3:39:53.740 --> 3:39:56.900\n I point out these examples of how a third party\n\n3:39:56.900 --> 3:39:58.940\n that we're kind of competing with in various ways.\n\n3:39:58.940 --> 3:40:00.580\n There's a number of these examples\n\n3:40:00.580 --> 3:40:03.820\n and they do work with a 10th of the people\n\n3:40:03.820 --> 3:40:06.940\n that we do internally and a lot of it comes from,\n\n3:40:06.940 --> 3:40:10.060\n yes, the small company can just go do it\n\n3:40:10.060 --> 3:40:12.860\n while in a big company, you do have to worry about,\n\n3:40:13.860 --> 3:40:16.740\n is there some SDK internally that you should be using\n\n3:40:16.740 --> 3:40:18.140\n because another team's making it,\n\n3:40:18.140 --> 3:40:21.020\n you have to have your cross functional group meetups\n\n3:40:21.020 --> 3:40:22.260\n for different things.\n\n3:40:22.260 --> 3:40:25.260\n You do have more concerns about privacy\n\n3:40:25.260 --> 3:40:28.900\n or diversity and equity and safety of different things,\n\n3:40:28.900 --> 3:40:31.860\n parental issues and things that a small startup company\n\n3:40:31.860 --> 3:40:36.540\n can just kind of cowboy off and do something interesting.\n\n3:40:36.540 --> 3:40:39.380\n And there's a lot more that is a problem\n\n3:40:39.380 --> 3:40:41.460\n that you have to pay attention to in the big companies,\n\n3:40:41.460 --> 3:40:43.860\n but I'm not willing to believe that we are within\n\n3:40:43.860 --> 3:40:46.300\n even a factor of two or four\n\n3:40:46.300 --> 3:40:48.820\n of what the efficiency could be.\n\n3:40:48.820 --> 3:40:52.020\n I am constantly kind of crying out for it's like,\n\n3:40:52.020 --> 3:40:53.460\n we can do better than this.\n\n3:40:53.460 --> 3:40:55.100\n And you wonder what the mechanisms\n\n3:40:55.100 --> 3:40:57.620\n to unlock that efficiency are.\n\n3:40:57.620 --> 3:41:02.500\n I don't, there is some sense in a large company\n\n3:41:02.500 --> 3:41:05.700\n that like an individual engineer might not believe\n\n3:41:05.700 --> 3:41:07.140\n that they can change the world.\n\n3:41:07.140 --> 3:41:11.460\n Maybe you delegate a little bit of the responsibility\n\n3:41:11.460 --> 3:41:14.420\n to be the one who changes the world in a big company,\n\n3:41:14.420 --> 3:41:19.420\n I think, but the reality is like the world will get changed\n\n3:41:19.460 --> 3:41:21.380\n by a single engineer anyway.\n\n3:41:21.380 --> 3:41:24.420\n So if whether inside Google or inside a startup,\n\n3:41:24.420 --> 3:41:26.300\n it doesn't matter, it's just like Google\n\n3:41:26.300 --> 3:41:29.740\n and Meta needs to help those engineers believe\n\n3:41:29.740 --> 3:41:32.860\n they're the ones that are gonna decrease that latency.\n\n3:41:32.860 --> 3:41:37.220\n It'll take one John Carmack, the 20 year old Carmack\n\n3:41:37.220 --> 3:41:40.580\n that's inside Meta right now to change everything.\n\n3:41:40.580 --> 3:41:43.060\n And I try to point that out and push people.\n\n3:41:43.060 --> 3:41:45.060\n It's like, try to go ahead.\n\n3:41:45.060 --> 3:41:46.780\n And when you see some, because there is,\n\n3:41:46.780 --> 3:41:48.860\n you get the silo mentality where you're like,\n\n3:41:48.860 --> 3:41:50.940\n okay, I know something's not right over there,\n\n3:41:50.940 --> 3:41:53.780\n but I'm staying in my lane here.\n\n3:41:53.780 --> 3:41:57.380\n And there's a couple of people that I can think about\n\n3:41:57.380 --> 3:41:59.580\n that are willing to just like hop all over the place\n\n3:41:59.580 --> 3:42:01.140\n and man, I treasure them.\n\n3:42:01.140 --> 3:42:03.980\n The people that are just willing to, they're fearless.\n\n3:42:03.980 --> 3:42:06.380\n They will go over and they will go rebuild the kernel\n\n3:42:06.380 --> 3:42:08.260\n and change this distribution and go in\n\n3:42:08.260 --> 3:42:11.860\n and hack a firmware over here to get something done right.\n\n3:42:11.860 --> 3:42:14.220\n And that is relatively rare.\n\n3:42:14.220 --> 3:42:15.780\n There's thousands of developers\n\n3:42:15.780 --> 3:42:17.580\n and you've got a small handful that are willing\n\n3:42:17.580 --> 3:42:19.540\n to operate at that level.\n\n3:42:19.540 --> 3:42:22.140\n And it's potentially risky for them.\n\n3:42:22.140 --> 3:42:24.940\n The politics are real in a lot of that.\n\n3:42:24.940 --> 3:42:27.820\n And I'm in the very much the privileged position\n\n3:42:27.820 --> 3:42:31.340\n of I'm more or less untouchable there\n\n3:42:31.340 --> 3:42:33.340\n where I've been dinged like twice\n\n3:42:33.340 --> 3:42:35.740\n for it's like you said something insensitive in that post\n\n3:42:35.740 --> 3:42:38.940\n and you should probably not say that.\n\n3:42:38.940 --> 3:42:42.340\n But for the most part, yes, I get away with,\n\n3:42:42.340 --> 3:42:45.060\n every week I'm posting something pretty loud\n\n3:42:45.060 --> 3:42:47.500\n and opinionated internally.\n\n3:42:47.500 --> 3:42:50.220\n And I think that's useful for the company,\n\n3:42:50.220 --> 3:42:54.880\n but yeah, it's rare to have a position like that.\n\n3:42:54.880 --> 3:42:56.620\n And I can't necessarily offer advice\n\n3:42:56.620 --> 3:42:59.060\n for how someone can do that.\n\n3:42:59.060 --> 3:43:01.540\n Well, you could offer advice to a company in general\n\n3:43:01.540 --> 3:43:06.060\n to give a little bit of freedom for the young wild,\n\n3:43:06.060 --> 3:43:09.680\n like the wildest ideas come from the young minds.\n\n3:43:10.740 --> 3:43:13.060\n And so you need to give the young minds freedom\n\n3:43:13.060 --> 3:43:16.420\n to think big and wild and crazy.\n\n3:43:16.420 --> 3:43:18.580\n And for that, they have to be opinionated.\n\n3:43:18.580 --> 3:43:23.580\n They have to think crazy ideas and thoughts\n\n3:43:24.380 --> 3:43:26.300\n and pursue them with a full passion\n\n3:43:26.300 --> 3:43:29.220\n without being slowed down by bureaucracy or managers\n\n3:43:29.220 --> 3:43:31.100\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:43:31.100 --> 3:43:33.060\n Obviously startups really empower that,\n\n3:43:33.060 --> 3:43:34.260\n but big companies could too.\n\n3:43:34.260 --> 3:43:37.960\n And that's a design challenge for big companies\n\n3:43:37.960 --> 3:43:40.180\n to see how can you enable that?\n\n3:43:40.180 --> 3:43:41.020\n How can you empower that?\n\n3:43:41.020 --> 3:43:41.840\n Yeah, because the big company,\n\n3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:43.600\n there are so many resources there.\n\n3:43:43.600 --> 3:43:46.580\n And they do, amazing things do get accomplished,\n\n3:43:46.580 --> 3:43:49.780\n but there's so much more that could come out of that.\n\n3:43:49.780 --> 3:43:51.540\n And I'm always hopeful.\n\n3:43:51.540 --> 3:43:53.220\n I'm an optimist in almost everything.\n\n3:43:53.220 --> 3:43:54.980\n I think things can get better.\n\n3:43:54.980 --> 3:43:56.780\n I think that they can improve things\n\n3:43:56.780 --> 3:43:58.340\n that you go through a path\n\n3:43:58.340 --> 3:44:01.420\n and you're learning kind of what does and doesn't work.\n\n3:44:01.420 --> 3:44:03.700\n And I'm not ready to be fatalistic\n\n3:44:03.700 --> 3:44:06.820\n about the kind of the outcome of any of that.\n\n3:44:06.820 --> 3:44:09.040\n Me neither, I know too many good people\n\n3:44:09.040 --> 3:44:12.420\n inside of those large companies that are incredible.\n\n3:44:12.420 --> 3:44:16.060\n You have a friendship with Elon Musk.\n\n3:44:16.060 --> 3:44:17.380\n Often when I talk to him,\n\n3:44:17.380 --> 3:44:19.660\n he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer\n\n3:44:19.660 --> 3:44:22.420\n and just a big picture thinker you are.\n\n3:44:22.420 --> 3:44:26.300\n His huge amount of respect for you.\n\n3:44:26.300 --> 3:44:28.900\n I just, I've never been a fly in the wall\n\n3:44:28.900 --> 3:44:30.600\n between a discussion between the two of you.\n\n3:44:30.600 --> 3:44:34.940\n I just wonder, is there something you guys debate,\n\n3:44:34.940 --> 3:44:36.800\n argue about, discuss?\n\n3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:38.300\n Is there some interesting problems\n\n3:44:38.300 --> 3:44:41.260\n that the two of you think about?\n\n3:44:41.260 --> 3:44:42.480\n You come from different worlds.\n\n3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:45.900\n Maybe there's some intersection in aerospace.\n\n3:44:45.900 --> 3:44:48.160\n Maybe there's some intersection\n\n3:44:48.160 --> 3:44:52.020\n in your new efforts in artificial intelligence\n\n3:44:52.020 --> 3:44:53.580\n in terms of thinking.\n\n3:44:53.580 --> 3:44:55.140\n Is there something interesting you could say\n\n3:44:55.140 --> 3:44:57.340\n about sort of the debates the two of you have?\n\n3:44:57.340 --> 3:44:58.860\n So I think in some ways,\n\n3:44:58.860 --> 3:45:01.300\n we do have a kind of similar background\n\n3:45:01.300 --> 3:45:03.540\n where we're almost exactly the same age.\n\n3:45:03.540 --> 3:45:06.420\n And we had kind of similar programming backgrounds\n\n3:45:06.420 --> 3:45:07.820\n on the personal computers\n\n3:45:07.820 --> 3:45:10.660\n and even some of the books that we would read\n\n3:45:10.660 --> 3:45:13.100\n and things that would kind of turn us into the people\n\n3:45:13.100 --> 3:45:14.700\n that we are today.\n\n3:45:14.700 --> 3:45:19.700\n And I think there is a degree of sensibility similarities\n\n3:45:19.700 --> 3:45:22.940\n where we kind of call bullshit on the same things\n\n3:45:22.940 --> 3:45:25.820\n and kind of see the same opportunities\n\n3:45:25.820 --> 3:45:27.220\n in different technology.\n\n3:45:27.220 --> 3:45:29.020\n And there's that sense of,\n\n3:45:29.020 --> 3:45:31.600\n I always talk about the speed of light solutions for things.\n\n3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:34.920\n And he's thinking about kind of minimum manufacturing\n\n3:45:34.920 --> 3:45:39.020\n and engineering and operational standpoints for things.\n\n3:45:39.020 --> 3:45:42.260\n And so, I mean, I first met Elon\n\n3:45:42.260 --> 3:45:44.080\n right at the start of the aerospace era\n\n3:45:44.080 --> 3:45:46.220\n where I wasn't familiar with,\n\n3:45:46.220 --> 3:45:47.780\n I was still in my game dev bubble.\n\n3:45:47.780 --> 3:45:49.860\n I really wasn't familiar with all the startups\n\n3:45:49.860 --> 3:45:52.080\n that were going and being successful\n\n3:45:52.080 --> 3:45:53.700\n and what went on with PayPal\n\n3:45:53.700 --> 3:45:54.980\n and all of his different companies.\n\n3:45:54.980 --> 3:45:58.900\n But I met him as I was starting to do armadillo aerospace.\n\n3:45:58.900 --> 3:46:03.140\n And he came down with kind of his right hand propulsion guy.\n\n3:46:03.140 --> 3:46:05.460\n And we talked about rockets.\n\n3:46:05.460 --> 3:46:07.280\n What can we do with this?\n\n3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:09.100\n And it was kind of specific things\n\n3:46:09.100 --> 3:46:12.140\n about like how are our flight computers set up?\n\n3:46:12.140 --> 3:46:14.740\n What are different propellant options?\n\n3:46:14.740 --> 3:46:17.580\n You know, what can happen with different ways\n\n3:46:17.580 --> 3:46:19.380\n of putting things together?\n\n3:46:19.380 --> 3:46:21.220\n And then in some ways,\n\n3:46:21.220 --> 3:46:22.900\n he was certainly the biggest player\n\n3:46:22.900 --> 3:46:24.900\n in the sort of alt space community\n\n3:46:24.900 --> 3:46:28.080\n that was going on in the early 2000s.\n\n3:46:28.080 --> 3:46:30.600\n He was the most well funded,\n\n3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:32.860\n although his funding in the larger scheme of things\n\n3:46:32.860 --> 3:46:36.780\n compared to like a NASA or something like that\n\n3:46:36.780 --> 3:46:38.260\n was really tiny.\n\n3:46:38.260 --> 3:46:40.520\n It was a lot more than I had at the time.\n\n3:46:40.520 --> 3:46:42.640\n But it was interesting.\n\n3:46:42.640 --> 3:46:45.560\n I had a point years later when I realized,\n\n3:46:45.560 --> 3:46:48.880\n okay, my financial resources at this point\n\n3:46:48.880 --> 3:46:50.480\n are basically what Elon's was\n\n3:46:50.480 --> 3:46:54.360\n when he went all in on SpaceX and Tesla.\n\n3:46:54.360 --> 3:46:58.360\n And there's, I think in many corners,\n\n3:46:58.360 --> 3:47:01.120\n he does not get the respect that he should\n\n3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:04.960\n about being a wealthy person that could just retire.\n\n3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:08.720\n And he went all in where he was really going to,\n\n3:47:08.720 --> 3:47:11.400\n he could have gone bust.\n\n3:47:11.400 --> 3:47:12.560\n And there's plenty of people,\n\n3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:16.780\n you'd look at the sad athletes or entertainers\n\n3:47:16.780 --> 3:47:18.600\n that had all the money in the world and blew it.\n\n3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:22.400\n And he could have been the business case example of that.\n\n3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:25.440\n But the things that he was doing,\n\n3:47:25.440 --> 3:47:29.880\n space exploration, electrification of transportation,\n\n3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:31.720\n solar city type things,\n\n3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:34.560\n these are big world level things.\n\n3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:36.800\n And I have a great deal of admiration\n\n3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:40.120\n that he was willing to throw himself so completely\n\n3:47:40.120 --> 3:47:43.080\n into that because in contrast with myself,\n\n3:47:43.080 --> 3:47:47.000\n I was doing armadillo aerospace with this tightly bounded,\n\n3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:49.560\n it was John's crazy money at the time\n\n3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:51.440\n that had a finite limit on it.\n\n3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:54.840\n It was never going to impact me or my family\n\n3:47:54.840 --> 3:47:56.560\n if it completely failed.\n\n3:47:56.560 --> 3:47:58.680\n And I was still hedging my bets,\n\n3:47:58.680 --> 3:48:01.060\n working at id Software at the time\n\n3:48:01.060 --> 3:48:04.960\n when he had been really all in there.\n\n3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:08.000\n And I have a huge amount of respect for that.\n\n3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:09.360\n And people do not,\n\n3:48:09.360 --> 3:48:11.480\n the other thing I get irritated with is people that say,\n\n3:48:11.480 --> 3:48:13.880\n it's like, oh, Elon's just a business guy.\n\n3:48:13.880 --> 3:48:16.500\n He just got like, he was gifted the money\n\n3:48:16.500 --> 3:48:19.440\n and he's just kind of investing in all of this\n\n3:48:19.440 --> 3:48:22.240\n when he was really deeply involved\n\n3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:24.520\n in a lot of the decisions.\n\n3:48:24.520 --> 3:48:25.800\n Not all of them were perfect,\n\n3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:30.380\n but he cared very much about engine material selection,\n\n3:48:30.380 --> 3:48:31.660\n propellant selection.\n\n3:48:31.660 --> 3:48:34.320\n And for years he'd be kind of telling me,\n\n3:48:34.320 --> 3:48:37.000\n it's like, get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff.\n\n3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:40.860\n It's like, liquid oxygen is the only proper oxidizer\n\n3:48:40.860 --> 3:48:41.840\n for this.\n\n3:48:41.840 --> 3:48:46.160\n And the times that I've gone through the factories\n\n3:48:46.160 --> 3:48:49.780\n with him, we're talking very detailed things\n\n3:48:49.780 --> 3:48:51.840\n about like how this weld is made,\n\n3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:54.720\n how this sub assembly goes together,\n\n3:48:54.720 --> 3:48:57.560\n what are like startup shut down behaviors\n\n3:48:57.560 --> 3:48:58.520\n of the different things.\n\n3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:03.440\n So he is really in there at a very detailed level.\n\n3:49:03.440 --> 3:49:06.960\n And I think that he is the best modern example now\n\n3:49:06.960 --> 3:49:08.520\n of someone that tries to,\n\n3:49:08.520 --> 3:49:11.880\n that can effectively micromanage some decisions on things\n\n3:49:11.880 --> 3:49:15.040\n on both Tesla and SpaceX to some degree\n\n3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:16.920\n where he cares enough about it.\n\n3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:19.280\n I worry a lot that he stretched too thin\n\n3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:23.000\n that you get Boring Company and Neuralink and Twitter\n\n3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:25.280\n and all the other possible things there\n\n3:49:25.280 --> 3:49:30.000\n where I know I've got limits on how much I can pay attention\n\n3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:34.040\n to that I have to kind of box off different amounts of time.\n\n3:49:34.040 --> 3:49:36.440\n And I look back at like at my aerospace side of things,\n\n3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:38.400\n it's like, I did not go all in on that.\n\n3:49:38.400 --> 3:49:40.640\n I did not commit myself at a level\n\n3:49:40.640 --> 3:49:43.500\n that it would have taken to be successful there.\n\n3:49:43.500 --> 3:49:46.440\n And I, yeah, and it's kind of a weird thing\n\n3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:49.000\n just like having a discussion with him.\n\n3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:50.840\n He's the richest man in the world right now,\n\n3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:55.840\n but he operates on a level that is still very much\n\n3:49:55.840 --> 3:50:00.160\n in my wheelhouse on a technical side of things.\n\n3:50:00.160 --> 3:50:01.000\n So.\n\n3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:02.440\n That doing that systems level type of thinking\n\n3:50:02.440 --> 3:50:04.880\n where you can go to the low level details\n\n3:50:04.880 --> 3:50:07.420\n and go up high to the big picture.\n\n3:50:07.420 --> 3:50:12.320\n Do you think in aerospace arena\n\n3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:14.480\n in the next five, 10 years,\n\n3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:16.360\n do you think we're gonna put a human on Mars?\n\n3:50:16.360 --> 3:50:18.560\n Like, what do you think is the interesting?\n\n3:50:20.280 --> 3:50:23.040\n No, I do, in fact, I made a bet with someone\n\n3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:24.860\n with a group of people kind of this\n\n3:50:24.860 --> 3:50:28.400\n about whether boots on Mars by 2030.\n\n3:50:28.400 --> 3:50:31.300\n And this was kind of a fun story\n\n3:50:31.300 --> 3:50:34.120\n because I was at an Intel sponsored event\n\n3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:37.380\n and we had a bunch of just world class, brilliant people.\n\n3:50:37.380 --> 3:50:39.120\n And we were talking about computing stuff,\n\n3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:41.520\n but the after dinner conversation was like,\n\n3:50:41.520 --> 3:50:42.340\n what are some other things?\n\n3:50:42.340 --> 3:50:43.920\n How are they gonna go in the future?\n\n3:50:43.920 --> 3:50:46.140\n And one of the ones tossed up on the whiteboard\n\n3:50:46.140 --> 3:50:49.040\n was like boots on Mars by 2030.\n\n3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:52.280\n And most of the people in the room thought, yes,\n\n3:50:52.280 --> 3:50:54.440\n I thought that like, SpaceX is kicking ass.\n\n3:50:54.440 --> 3:50:57.000\n We've got all this possible stuff.\n\n3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:59.440\n Seems likely that it's gonna go that way.\n\n3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:03.280\n And I said, no, I think less than 50% chance\n\n3:51:03.280 --> 3:51:05.440\n that it's going to make it there.\n\n3:51:05.440 --> 3:51:07.320\n And people were kind of like,\n\n3:51:07.320 --> 3:51:09.440\n oh, why the pessimism or whatever?\n\n3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:12.040\n And of course I'm an optimist at almost everything,\n\n3:51:12.040 --> 3:51:14.820\n but for me to be the one kind of outlier saying,\n\n3:51:14.820 --> 3:51:16.160\n no, I don't think so.\n\n3:51:17.240 --> 3:51:19.400\n Then I started saying some of the things I said,\n\n3:51:19.400 --> 3:51:21.040\n well, let's be concrete about it.\n\n3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:24.880\n Let's bet $10,000 that it's not gonna happen.\n\n3:51:24.880 --> 3:51:29.800\n And this was really a startling thing to see that I,\n\n3:51:29.800 --> 3:51:31.640\n again, room full of brilliant people,\n\n3:51:31.640 --> 3:51:34.320\n but as soon as like money came on the line\n\n3:51:34.320 --> 3:51:36.680\n and they were like, do I wanna put 10,000?\n\n3:51:36.680 --> 3:51:38.800\n I was not the richest person in the room.\n\n3:51:38.800 --> 3:51:41.280\n There were people much better off than I was.\n\n3:51:41.280 --> 3:51:45.320\n There's a spectrum, but as soon as they started thinking,\n\n3:51:45.320 --> 3:51:46.760\n it's like, oh, I could lose money\n\n3:51:46.760 --> 3:51:50.760\n by keeping my position right now.\n\n3:51:50.760 --> 3:51:53.400\n And all these engineers, they engaged their brain.\n\n3:51:53.400 --> 3:51:55.120\n They started thinking, it's like, okay,\n\n3:51:55.120 --> 3:51:57.840\n launch windows, launch delays,\n\n3:51:57.840 --> 3:52:00.340\n like how many times would it take to get this right?\n\n3:52:00.340 --> 3:52:02.680\n What historical precedents do we have?\n\n3:52:02.680 --> 3:52:05.800\n And then it mostly came down to, it's like,\n\n3:52:05.800 --> 3:52:08.200\n well, what about in transit by 2030?\n\n3:52:08.200 --> 3:52:11.440\n And then what about different things\n\n3:52:11.440 --> 3:52:13.880\n or would you go for 2032?\n\n3:52:13.880 --> 3:52:15.760\n But one of the people did go ahead\n\n3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:18.300\n and was optimistic enough to make a bet with me.\n\n3:52:18.300 --> 3:52:21.960\n So I have a $10,000 bet that by 2030,\n\n3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:24.400\n I think it's gonna happen shortly thereafter.\n\n3:52:24.400 --> 3:52:26.460\n I think there will probably be infrastructure on Mars\n\n3:52:26.460 --> 3:52:29.960\n by 2030, but I don't think that we'll have humans\n\n3:52:29.960 --> 3:52:31.120\n on Mars on 2030.\n\n3:52:31.120 --> 3:52:33.540\n I think it's possible, but I think it's less\n\n3:52:33.540 --> 3:52:36.720\n than a 50% chance, so I felt safe making that bet.\n\n3:52:36.720 --> 3:52:39.960\n Well, I think you had an interesting point.\n\n3:52:39.960 --> 3:52:41.200\n Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:42.460\n That's a dark one.\n\n3:52:42.460 --> 3:52:48.800\n That should perhaps help people appreciate Elon Musk,\n\n3:52:48.800 --> 3:52:53.400\n which is, in this particular effort,\n\n3:52:53.400 --> 3:52:56.840\n Elon is critical to the success.\n\n3:52:56.840 --> 3:53:01.840\n SpaceX seems to be critical to, you know,\n\n3:53:03.640 --> 3:53:07.040\n humans on Mars by 2030 or thereabouts.\n\n3:53:07.040 --> 3:53:09.160\n So if something happens to Elon,\n\n3:53:09.160 --> 3:53:12.160\n then all of this collapses.\n\n3:53:12.160 --> 3:53:16.160\n And this is in contrast to the other $10,000 bet\n\n3:53:16.160 --> 3:53:19.160\n I made kind of recently, and that was self driving cars\n\n3:53:19.160 --> 3:53:22.160\n at like a level five running around cities.\n\n3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:24.160\n And people have kind of nitpicked that\n\n3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:26.160\n that we probably don't mean exactly level five,\n\n3:53:26.160 --> 3:53:29.160\n but the guy I'm having the bet with is,\n\n3:53:29.160 --> 3:53:31.160\n we're gonna be, we know what we mean about this.\n\n3:53:31.160 --> 3:53:32.160\n Jeff Atwood.\n\n3:53:32.160 --> 3:53:36.160\n Yeah, coding horror and stack overflow and all.\n\n3:53:36.160 --> 3:53:40.160\n But yeah, I mean, he doesn't think that people\n\n3:53:40.160 --> 3:53:43.160\n are gonna be riding around in robo taxis in 2030\n\n3:53:43.160 --> 3:53:47.160\n in major cities, just like you take an Uber now.\n\n3:53:47.160 --> 3:53:48.160\n And I think it will.\n\n3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:49.160\n You think it will.\n\n3:53:49.160 --> 3:53:51.160\n And the difference is, everybody looks at this,\n\n3:53:51.160 --> 3:53:53.160\n it's like, oh, but Tesla's been wrong for years.\n\n3:53:53.160 --> 3:53:56.160\n They've been promising it for years and it's not here yet.\n\n3:53:56.160 --> 3:54:00.160\n And the reason this is different than the bet with Mars\n\n3:54:00.160 --> 3:54:04.160\n is Mars really is more than is comfortable\n\n3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:06.160\n a bet on Elon Musk.\n\n3:54:06.160 --> 3:54:11.160\n That is his thing and he is really going to move\n\n3:54:11.160 --> 3:54:13.160\n heaven and earth to try to make that happen.\n\n3:54:13.160 --> 3:54:17.160\n And perhaps not even SpaceX, perhaps just Elon Musk.\n\n3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:21.160\n Yeah, because if Elon went away and SpaceX went public\n\n3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:23.160\n and got a board of directors,\n\n3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:26.160\n there are more profitable things they could be doing\n\n3:54:26.160 --> 3:54:29.160\n than focusing on human presence on Mars.\n\n3:54:29.160 --> 3:54:32.160\n So this really is a sort of personal thing there.\n\n3:54:32.160 --> 3:54:36.160\n And in contrast with that, self driving cars\n\n3:54:36.160 --> 3:54:40.160\n have a dozen credible companies working really hard.\n\n3:54:40.160 --> 3:54:43.160\n And while, yes, it's going slower\n\n3:54:43.160 --> 3:54:45.160\n than most people thought it would,\n\n3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:49.160\n betting against that is a bet against almost the entire world\n\n3:54:49.160 --> 3:54:51.160\n in terms of all of these companies\n\n3:54:51.160 --> 3:54:53.160\n that have all of these incentives.\n\n3:54:53.160 --> 3:54:56.160\n It's not just one guy's passion project.\n\n3:54:56.160 --> 3:54:59.160\n And I do think that it is solvable.\n\n3:54:59.160 --> 3:55:02.160\n Although I recognize it's not 100% chance\n\n3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:05.160\n because it's possible the long tail of self driving problems\n\n3:55:05.160 --> 3:55:08.160\n winds up being an AGI complete problem.\n\n3:55:08.160 --> 3:55:11.160\n I think there's plenty of value to mine out of it with narrow AI.\n\n3:55:11.160 --> 3:55:15.160\n And I think that it's going to happen probably more so\n\n3:55:15.160 --> 3:55:16.160\n than people expect.\n\n3:55:16.160 --> 3:55:18.160\n But it's that whole sigmoid curve\n\n3:55:18.160 --> 3:55:21.160\n where you overestimate the near term progress\n\n3:55:21.160 --> 3:55:23.160\n and you underestimate the long term progress.\n\n3:55:23.160 --> 3:55:26.160\n And I think self driving is going to be like that.\n\n3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:29.160\n And I think 2030 is still a pretty good bet.\n\n3:55:29.160 --> 3:55:35.160\n Yeah, unfortunately, self driving is a problem\n\n3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:41.160\n that is safety critical, meaning that if you don't do it well,\n\n3:55:41.160 --> 3:55:43.160\n people get hurt.\n\n3:55:43.160 --> 3:55:46.160\n But the other side of that is people are terrible drivers.\n\n3:55:46.160 --> 3:55:48.160\n So it is not going to be,\n\n3:55:48.160 --> 3:55:50.160\n that's probably going to be the argument that gets it through\n\n3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:54.160\n is like we can save 10,000 lives a year\n\n3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:57.160\n by taking imperfect self driving cars\n\n3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:00.160\n and letting them take over a lot of driving responsibilities.\n\n3:56:00.160 --> 3:56:05.160\n It's like 30,000 people a year die in auto accidents right now in America.\n\n3:56:05.160 --> 3:56:07.160\n And a lot of those are preventable.\n\n3:56:07.160 --> 3:56:09.160\n And the problem is you'll have people that\n\n3:56:09.160 --> 3:56:11.160\n every time a Tesla crashes into something,\n\n3:56:11.160 --> 3:56:14.160\n you've got a bunch of people that literally have vested interests\n\n3:56:14.160 --> 3:56:17.160\n shorting Tesla to come out and make it the worst thing in the world.\n\n3:56:17.160 --> 3:56:19.160\n And people will be fighting against that.\n\n3:56:19.160 --> 3:56:21.160\n But optimist in me again,\n\n3:56:21.160 --> 3:56:26.160\n I think that we will have systems that are statistically safer than human drivers\n\n3:56:26.160 --> 3:56:30.160\n and we will be saving thousands and thousands of lives every year\n\n3:56:30.160 --> 3:56:34.160\n when we can hand over more of those responsibilities to it.\n\n3:56:34.160 --> 3:56:38.160\n I do still think as a person who studied this problem very deeply\n\n3:56:38.160 --> 3:56:40.160\n from a human side as well,\n\n3:56:40.160 --> 3:56:46.160\n it's still an open problem how good slash bad humans are driving.\n\n3:56:46.160 --> 3:56:49.160\n It's a kind of funny thing we say about each other.\n\n3:56:49.160 --> 3:56:51.160\n Oh, humans suck at driving.\n\n3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:54.160\n Everybody except you, of course.\n\n3:56:54.160 --> 3:56:56.160\n Like we think we're good at driving.\n\n3:56:56.160 --> 3:56:59.160\n But I, after really studying it,\n\n3:56:59.160 --> 3:57:03.160\n I think you start to notice, you know,\n\n3:57:03.160 --> 3:57:06.160\n because I watched hundreds of hours of humans driving\n\n3:57:06.160 --> 3:57:08.160\n with the projects of this kind of thing.\n\n3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:11.160\n You've noticed that even with the distraction,\n\n3:57:11.160 --> 3:57:13.160\n even with everything else,\n\n3:57:13.160 --> 3:57:17.160\n humans are able to do some incredible things\n\n3:57:17.160 --> 3:57:19.160\n with the attention,\n\n3:57:19.160 --> 3:57:21.160\n even when you're just looking at the smartphone,\n\n3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:23.160\n just to get cues from the environment\n\n3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:26.160\n to make last second decisions,\n\n3:57:26.160 --> 3:57:30.160\n to use instinctual type of decisions that actually save your ass\n\n3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:32.160\n time and time and time again.\n\n3:57:32.160 --> 3:57:37.160\n And are able to do that with so much uncertainty around you\n\n3:57:37.160 --> 3:57:40.160\n in such tricky dynamic environments.\n\n3:57:40.160 --> 3:57:42.160\n I don't know.\n\n3:57:42.160 --> 3:57:49.160\n I don't know exactly how hard is it to beat that kind of skill\n\n3:57:49.160 --> 3:57:51.160\n of common sense reasoning.\n\n3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:53.160\n This is one of those interesting things that there have been\n\n3:57:53.160 --> 3:57:56.160\n a lot of studies about how experts in their field\n\n3:57:56.160 --> 3:57:59.160\n usually underestimate the progress that's going to happen\n\n3:57:59.160 --> 3:58:02.160\n because an expert thinks about all the problems they deal with\n\n3:58:02.160 --> 3:58:05.160\n and they're like, damn, I'm going to have a hard time\n\n3:58:05.160 --> 3:58:06.160\n solving all of this.\n\n3:58:06.160 --> 3:58:08.160\n And they filter out the fact that they are one expert\n\n3:58:08.160 --> 3:58:10.160\n in a field of thousands.\n\n3:58:10.160 --> 3:58:13.160\n And you think about, yeah, I can't do all of that.\n\n3:58:13.160 --> 3:58:16.160\n And you sometimes forget about the scope of the ecosystem\n\n3:58:16.160 --> 3:58:18.160\n that you're embedded in.\n\n3:58:18.160 --> 3:58:20.160\n And if you think back eight years, very specifically,\n\n3:58:20.160 --> 3:58:23.160\n the state of AI and machine learning, where was that?\n\n3:58:23.160 --> 3:58:26.160\n We had just gotten Resnets probably at that point.\n\n3:58:26.160 --> 3:58:29.160\n And you look at all the amazing magical things\n\n3:58:29.160 --> 3:58:31.160\n that have happened in eight years,\n\n3:58:31.160 --> 3:58:34.160\n and they do kind of seem to be happening a little faster\n\n3:58:34.160 --> 3:58:36.160\n in recent years also.\n\n3:58:36.160 --> 3:58:39.160\n And you project that eight more years into the future,\n\n3:58:39.160 --> 3:58:41.160\n where, again, I think there's a 50% chance\n\n3:58:41.160 --> 3:58:43.160\n we're going to have signs of life of AGI,\n\n3:58:43.160 --> 3:58:46.160\n which we can put through driver's ed if we need to\n\n3:58:46.160 --> 3:58:48.160\n to actually build self driving cars.\n\n3:58:48.160 --> 3:58:51.160\n And I think that the narrow systems are going to have\n\n3:58:51.160 --> 3:58:54.160\n real value demonstrated well before then.\n\n3:58:54.160 --> 3:59:00.160\n So signs of life in AGI, you've mentioned that,\n\n3:59:00.160 --> 3:59:04.160\n okay, first of all, you're one of the most brilliant people\n\n3:59:04.160 --> 3:59:05.160\n on this earth.\n\n3:59:05.160 --> 3:59:08.160\n You could be solving a number of different problems,\n\n3:59:08.160 --> 3:59:09.160\n as you've mentioned.\n\n3:59:09.160 --> 3:59:12.160\n Your mind was attracted to nuclear energy.\n\n3:59:12.160 --> 3:59:14.160\n Obviously, virtual reality with the metaverse\n\n3:59:14.160 --> 3:59:16.160\n is something you could have a tremendous impact on.\n\n3:59:16.160 --> 3:59:19.160\n So I do want to say a quick thing about nuclear energy,\n\n3:59:19.160 --> 3:59:25.160\n where this is something that so precisely feels like\n\n3:59:25.160 --> 3:59:29.160\n aerospace before SpaceX, where from everything that I know\n\n3:59:29.160 --> 3:59:33.160\n about all of these, the physics of this stuff hasn't changed.\n\n3:59:33.160 --> 3:59:36.160\n And the reasons why things are expensive now\n\n3:59:36.160 --> 3:59:38.160\n are not fundamental.\n\n3:59:38.160 --> 3:59:44.160\n Somebody should be going into a really hard Elon Musk style\n\n3:59:44.160 --> 3:59:48.160\n at fission, economical fission, not fusion,\n\n3:59:48.160 --> 3:59:52.160\n where the fusion is the kind of the darling of people\n\n3:59:52.160 --> 3:59:55.160\n that want to go and do nuclear because it doesn't have\n\n3:59:55.160 --> 3:59:58.160\n the taint that fission has in a lot of people's minds.\n\n3:59:58.160 --> 4:00:03.160\n But it's an almost absurdly complex thing where nuclear fusion,\n\n4:00:03.160 --> 4:00:06.160\n as you look at the tokamaks or any of the things that people\n\n4:00:06.160 --> 4:00:09.160\n are building, and it's doing all of this infrastructure\n\n4:00:09.160 --> 4:00:12.160\n just at the end of the day to make something hot\n\n4:00:12.160 --> 4:00:14.160\n that you can then turn into energy\n\n4:00:14.160 --> 4:00:16.160\n through a conventional power plant.\n\n4:00:16.160 --> 4:00:18.160\n And all of that work, which we think\n\n4:00:18.160 --> 4:00:21.160\n we've got line of sight on, but even if it comes out,\n\n4:00:21.160 --> 4:00:25.160\n then you have to do all of that immensely complex expensive\n\n4:00:25.160 --> 4:00:28.160\n stuff just to make something hot, where nuclear fission\n\n4:00:28.160 --> 4:00:30.160\n is basically you put these two rocks together\n\n4:00:30.160 --> 4:00:32.160\n and they get hot all by themselves.\n\n4:00:32.160 --> 4:00:35.160\n That is just that much simpler.\n\n4:00:35.160 --> 4:00:37.160\n It's just orders of magnitude simpler.\n\n4:00:37.160 --> 4:00:40.160\n And the actual rocks, the refined uranium,\n\n4:00:40.160 --> 4:00:41.160\n is not very expensive.\n\n4:00:41.160 --> 4:00:44.160\n It's a couple percent of the cost of electricity.\n\n4:00:44.160 --> 4:00:47.160\n That's why I made that point where you could have something\n\n4:00:47.160 --> 4:00:51.160\n which was five times less efficient than current systems.\n\n4:00:51.160 --> 4:00:54.160\n And if the rest of the plant was a whole bunch cheaper,\n\n4:00:54.160 --> 4:00:56.160\n you could still be super, super valuable.\n\n4:00:56.160 --> 4:01:02.160\n So how much of the pie do you think could be solved\n\n4:01:02.160 --> 4:01:04.160\n by nuclear energy by fission?\n\n4:01:04.160 --> 4:01:07.160\n So how much could it become the primary source\n\n4:01:07.160 --> 4:01:08.160\n of energy on Earth?\n\n4:01:08.160 --> 4:01:10.160\n It could be most of it.\n\n4:01:10.160 --> 4:01:12.160\n Like the reserves of uranium, as it stands now,\n\n4:01:12.160 --> 4:01:13.160\n could not power the whole Earth.\n\n4:01:13.160 --> 4:01:16.160\n But you get into breeder reactors and thorium\n\n4:01:16.160 --> 4:01:19.160\n and things like that that you do for conventional fission.\n\n4:01:19.160 --> 4:01:22.160\n There is enough for everything.\n\n4:01:22.160 --> 4:01:25.160\n Now, I mean, solar, photovoltaic has been amazing.\n\n4:01:25.160 --> 4:01:29.160\n One of my current projects is working on an off grid system.\n\n4:01:29.160 --> 4:01:31.160\n And it's been fun just kind of, again, putting my hands\n\n4:01:31.160 --> 4:01:34.160\n on all this, stripping the wires and wiring things together\n\n4:01:34.160 --> 4:01:35.160\n and doing all of that.\n\n4:01:35.160 --> 4:01:37.160\n And just having followed that a little bit\n\n4:01:37.160 --> 4:01:40.160\n from the outside over the last couple decades,\n\n4:01:40.160 --> 4:01:43.160\n there's been semiconductor like magical progress\n\n4:01:43.160 --> 4:01:45.160\n in what's going on there.\n\n4:01:45.160 --> 4:01:47.160\n So I'm all for all of that.\n\n4:01:47.160 --> 4:01:49.160\n But it doesn't solve everything.\n\n4:01:49.160 --> 4:01:52.160\n And nuclear really still does seem like the smart money\n\n4:01:52.160 --> 4:01:55.160\n bet for what you should be getting for baseband\n\n4:01:55.160 --> 4:01:56.160\n on a lot of things.\n\n4:01:56.160 --> 4:02:00.160\n And solar may be cheaper for peaking over air conditioning\n\n4:02:00.160 --> 4:02:02.160\n loads during the summer and things\n\n4:02:02.160 --> 4:02:05.160\n that you can push around in different ways.\n\n4:02:05.160 --> 4:02:07.160\n But it's one of those things that's\n\n4:02:07.160 --> 4:02:10.160\n it's just strange how we've had the technology sitting there.\n\n4:02:10.160 --> 4:02:14.160\n But these non technical reasons on the social optics of it\n\n4:02:14.160 --> 4:02:18.160\n has been this major forcing function for something\n\n4:02:18.160 --> 4:02:21.160\n that really should be at the cornerstone of all\n\n4:02:21.160 --> 4:02:23.160\n of the world's concerns with energy.\n\n4:02:23.160 --> 4:02:27.160\n It's interesting how the non technical factors have really\n\n4:02:27.160 --> 4:02:31.160\n dominated something that is so fundamental to the existence\n\n4:02:31.160 --> 4:02:34.160\n of the human race as we know it today.\n\n4:02:34.160 --> 4:02:36.160\n And much of the troubles of the world,\n\n4:02:36.160 --> 4:02:40.160\n including wars in different parts of the world like Ukraine\n\n4:02:40.160 --> 4:02:41.160\n is energy based.\n\n4:02:41.160 --> 4:02:47.160\n And yeah, it's just sitting right there to be solved.\n\n4:02:47.160 --> 4:02:50.160\n That said, I mean, to me personally,\n\n4:02:50.160 --> 4:02:53.160\n I think it's clear that if AGI were to be achieved,\n\n4:02:53.160 --> 4:02:55.160\n that would change the course of human history.\n\n4:02:55.160 --> 4:03:00.160\n So AGI wise, I was making this decision about what\n\n4:03:00.160 --> 4:03:03.160\n do I want to focus on after VR.\n\n4:03:03.160 --> 4:03:06.160\n And I'm still working on VR regularly.\n\n4:03:06.160 --> 4:03:09.160\n I spend a day a week kind of consulting with Meta.\n\n4:03:09.160 --> 4:03:13.160\n And Boz styles me the consulting CTO.\n\n4:03:13.160 --> 4:03:15.160\n It's kind of like the Sherlock Holmes that\n\n4:03:15.160 --> 4:03:18.160\n comes in and consults on some of the specific tough issues.\n\n4:03:18.160 --> 4:03:21.160\n And I'm still pretty passionate about all of that.\n\n4:03:21.160 --> 4:03:25.160\n But I have been figuring out how to compartmentalize and force\n\n4:03:25.160 --> 4:03:29.160\n that into a smaller box to work on some other things.\n\n4:03:29.160 --> 4:03:30.160\n And I did come down to this decision\n\n4:03:30.160 --> 4:03:34.160\n between working on economical nuclear fission\n\n4:03:34.160 --> 4:03:36.160\n or artificial general intelligence.\n\n4:03:36.160 --> 4:03:39.160\n And the fission side of things, I've\n\n4:03:39.160 --> 4:03:42.160\n got a bunch of interesting things going that way.\n\n4:03:42.160 --> 4:03:46.160\n But that would be a fairly big project thing to do.\n\n4:03:46.160 --> 4:03:49.160\n I don't think it needs to be as big as people expect.\n\n4:03:49.160 --> 4:03:53.160\n I do think something original SpaceX sized, you build it,\n\n4:03:53.160 --> 4:03:56.160\n power your building off of it, and then the government,\n\n4:03:56.160 --> 4:03:59.160\n I think, will come around to what you need to.\n\n4:03:59.160 --> 4:04:01.160\n Everybody loves an existence proof.\n\n4:04:01.160 --> 4:04:03.160\n I think it's possible somebody should be doing this.\n\n4:04:03.160 --> 4:04:05.160\n But it's going to involve some politics.\n\n4:04:05.160 --> 4:04:07.160\n It's going to involve decent sized teams\n\n4:04:07.160 --> 4:04:09.160\n and a bunch of this cross functional stuff\n\n4:04:09.160 --> 4:04:11.160\n that I don't love.\n\n4:04:11.160 --> 4:04:15.160\n While the artificial general intelligence side of things,\n\n4:04:15.160 --> 4:04:21.160\n it seems to me like this is the highest leverage\n\n4:04:21.160 --> 4:04:24.160\n moment for potentially a single individual,\n\n4:04:24.160 --> 4:04:26.160\n potentially in the history of the world,\n\n4:04:26.160 --> 4:04:30.160\n where the things that we know about the brain, about what we\n\n4:04:30.160 --> 4:04:33.160\n can do with artificial intelligence,\n\n4:04:33.160 --> 4:04:36.160\n nobody can say absolutely on any of these things.\n\n4:04:36.160 --> 4:04:40.160\n But I am not a madman for saying that it is likely\n\n4:04:40.160 --> 4:04:44.160\n that the code for artificial general intelligence\n\n4:04:44.160 --> 4:04:48.160\n is going to be tens of thousands of lines of code,\n\n4:04:48.160 --> 4:04:50.160\n not millions of lines of code.\n\n4:04:50.160 --> 4:04:53.160\n This is code that conceivably one individual could write,\n\n4:04:53.160 --> 4:04:57.160\n unlike writing a new web browser or operating system.\n\n4:04:57.160 --> 4:05:01.160\n And based on the progress that AI, machine learning,\n\n4:05:01.160 --> 4:05:04.160\n has made in the recent decade, it's\n\n4:05:04.160 --> 4:05:07.160\n likely that the important things that we don't know\n\n4:05:07.160 --> 4:05:09.160\n are relatively simple.\n\n4:05:09.160 --> 4:05:11.160\n There's probably a handful of things.\n\n4:05:11.160 --> 4:05:16.160\n My bet is that I think there's less than six key insights that\n\n4:05:16.160 --> 4:05:17.160\n need to be made.\n\n4:05:17.160 --> 4:05:19.160\n Each one of them can probably be written\n\n4:05:19.160 --> 4:05:20.160\n on the back of an envelope.\n\n4:05:20.160 --> 4:05:22.160\n We don't know what they are.\n\n4:05:22.160 --> 4:05:26.160\n But when they're put together in concert with GPUs at scale\n\n4:05:26.160 --> 4:05:28.160\n and the data that we all have access to,\n\n4:05:28.160 --> 4:05:32.160\n that we can make something that behaves like a human being\n\n4:05:32.160 --> 4:05:35.160\n or like a living creature and that can then\n\n4:05:35.160 --> 4:05:39.160\n be educated in whatever ways that we need to get to the point\n\n4:05:39.160 --> 4:05:43.160\n where we can have universal remote workers where anything\n\n4:05:43.160 --> 4:05:45.160\n that somebody does mediated by a computer\n\n4:05:45.160 --> 4:05:49.160\n and doesn't require physical interaction that an AGI will\n\n4:05:49.160 --> 4:05:50.160\n be able to do.\n\n4:05:50.160 --> 4:05:54.160\n We can already simulate the equivalent of the Zoom meetings\n\n4:05:54.160 --> 4:05:58.160\n with avatars and synthetic deep fakes and whatnot.\n\n4:05:58.160 --> 4:06:00.160\n We can definitely do that.\n\n4:06:00.160 --> 4:06:03.160\n We have superhuman capabilities on any narrow thing\n\n4:06:03.160 --> 4:06:07.160\n that we can formalize and make a loss function for.\n\n4:06:07.160 --> 4:06:10.160\n But there's things we don't know how to do now.\n\n4:06:10.160 --> 4:06:13.160\n But I don't think they are unapproachably hard.\n\n4:06:13.160 --> 4:06:16.160\n Now, that's incredibly hubristic to say that it's like,\n\n4:06:16.160 --> 4:06:19.160\n but I think that what I said a couple years ago\n\n4:06:19.160 --> 4:06:23.160\n is a 50% chance that somewhere there will be signs of life\n\n4:06:23.160 --> 4:06:25.160\n of AGI in 2030.\n\n4:06:25.160 --> 4:06:27.160\n And I've probably increased that slightly.\n\n4:06:27.160 --> 4:06:30.160\n I may be at 55%, 60% now because I\n\n4:06:30.160 --> 4:06:34.160\n do think there's a little sense of acceleration there.\n\n4:06:34.160 --> 4:06:36.160\n So I wonder what the, and by the way,\n\n4:06:36.160 --> 4:06:39.160\n you also written that I bet with hindsight\n\n4:06:39.160 --> 4:06:42.160\n we will find that clear antecedents of all\n\n4:06:42.160 --> 4:06:44.160\n the critical remaining steps for AGI\n\n4:06:44.160 --> 4:06:48.160\n are already buried somewhere in the vast literature of today.\n\n4:06:48.160 --> 4:06:50.160\n So the ideas are already there.\n\n4:06:50.160 --> 4:06:52.160\n I think that's likely the case.\n\n4:06:52.160 --> 4:06:54.160\n One of the things that appeals to so many people,\n\n4:06:54.160 --> 4:06:56.160\n including me, about the promise of AGI\n\n4:06:56.160 --> 4:06:59.160\n is we know that we're only drinking\n\n4:06:59.160 --> 4:07:03.160\n from a straw from the fire hose of all the information out there.\n\n4:07:03.160 --> 4:07:07.160\n I mean, you look at just in a very narrowly bounded field\n\n4:07:07.160 --> 4:07:10.160\n like machine learning, like you can't read all the papers that\n\n4:07:10.160 --> 4:07:11.160\n come out all the time.\n\n4:07:11.160 --> 4:07:14.160\n You can't go back and read all the clever things\n\n4:07:14.160 --> 4:07:16.160\n that people did in the 90s or earlier\n\n4:07:16.160 --> 4:07:18.160\n that people have forgotten about because they didn't pan out\n\n4:07:18.160 --> 4:07:22.160\n at the time when they were trying to do them with 12 neurons.\n\n4:07:22.160 --> 4:07:25.160\n So this idea that, yeah, I think there\n\n4:07:25.160 --> 4:07:29.160\n are gems buried in some of the older literature that was not\n\n4:07:29.160 --> 4:07:31.160\n the path taken by everything.\n\n4:07:31.160 --> 4:07:34.160\n And you can see a herd mentality on the things that\n\n4:07:34.160 --> 4:07:35.160\n happen right now.\n\n4:07:35.160 --> 4:07:36.160\n It's almost funny to see.\n\n4:07:36.160 --> 4:07:38.160\n It's like, oh, Google does something,\n\n4:07:38.160 --> 4:07:41.160\n and OpenAI does something, Meta does something.\n\n4:07:41.160 --> 4:07:43.160\n They're the same people that all talk to each other,\n\n4:07:43.160 --> 4:07:45.160\n and they're all one upping each other,\n\n4:07:45.160 --> 4:07:47.160\n and they're all capable of implementing\n\n4:07:47.160 --> 4:07:49.160\n each other's work given a month or two\n\n4:07:49.160 --> 4:07:52.160\n after somebody has an announcement of that.\n\n4:07:52.160 --> 4:07:55.160\n But there's a whole world of possible approaches\n\n4:07:55.160 --> 4:07:57.160\n to machine learning.\n\n4:07:57.160 --> 4:08:00.160\n And I think that we probably will, in hindsight,\n\n4:08:00.160 --> 4:08:03.160\n go back and see it's like, yeah, that was kind of clearly\n\n4:08:03.160 --> 4:08:06.160\n predicted by this early paper here.\n\n4:08:06.160 --> 4:08:08.160\n And this turns out that if you do this and this\n\n4:08:08.160 --> 4:08:11.160\n and take this result from animal training\n\n4:08:11.160 --> 4:08:13.160\n and this thing from neuroscience over here\n\n4:08:13.160 --> 4:08:16.160\n and put it together and set up this curriculum for them\n\n4:08:16.160 --> 4:08:19.160\n to learn in, that that's kind of what it took.\n\n4:08:19.160 --> 4:08:21.160\n You don't have too many people now\n\n4:08:21.160 --> 4:08:23.160\n that are still saying it's not possible\n\n4:08:23.160 --> 4:08:25.160\n or it's going to take hundreds of years.\n\n4:08:25.160 --> 4:08:29.160\n And 10 years ago, you would get a collection of experts,\n\n4:08:29.160 --> 4:08:32.160\n and you would have a decent chunk on the margin that either\n\n4:08:32.160 --> 4:08:35.160\n say not possible or a couple hundred years,\n\n4:08:35.160 --> 4:08:36.160\n might be centuries.\n\n4:08:36.160 --> 4:08:40.160\n And the median estimate would be like 50, 70 years.\n\n4:08:40.160 --> 4:08:41.160\n And it's been coming down.\n\n4:08:41.160 --> 4:08:44.160\n And I know with me saying eight years for something,\n\n4:08:44.160 --> 4:08:46.160\n that still puts me on the optimistic side,\n\n4:08:46.160 --> 4:08:49.160\n but it's not crazy out in the fringes.\n\n4:08:49.160 --> 4:08:52.160\n And just being able to look at that at a meta level\n\n4:08:52.160 --> 4:08:57.160\n about the trend of the predictions going down there,\n\n4:08:57.160 --> 4:09:01.160\n the idea that something could be happening relatively soon.\n\n4:09:01.160 --> 4:09:04.160\n Now, I do not believe in fast takeoffs.\n\n4:09:04.160 --> 4:09:06.160\n That's one of the safety issues that people say,\n\n4:09:06.160 --> 4:09:08.160\n it's like, oh, it's going to go, boom,\n\n4:09:08.160 --> 4:09:10.160\n and the AI is going to take over the world.\n\n4:09:10.160 --> 4:09:12.160\n There's a lot of reasons I don't think\n\n4:09:12.160 --> 4:09:14.160\n that's a credible position.\n\n4:09:14.160 --> 4:09:16.160\n And I think that we will go from a point\n\n4:09:16.160 --> 4:09:20.160\n where we start seeing things that credibly look\n\n4:09:20.160 --> 4:09:22.160\n like animals behaviors.\n\n4:09:22.160 --> 4:09:25.160\n And I have a human voice box wired into them.\n\n4:09:25.160 --> 4:09:27.160\n It's like I tried to get Elon to say,\n\n4:09:27.160 --> 4:09:30.160\n it's like your pig in Neuralink, give it a human voice box\n\n4:09:30.160 --> 4:09:33.160\n and let it start learning human words.\n\n4:09:33.160 --> 4:09:36.160\n I think animal intelligence is closer to human intelligence\n\n4:09:36.160 --> 4:09:38.160\n than a lot of people like to think.\n\n4:09:38.160 --> 4:09:42.160\n And I think that culture and modalities of IO\n\n4:09:42.160 --> 4:09:45.160\n make the Gulf seem a lot bigger than it actually is.\n\n4:09:45.160 --> 4:09:47.160\n There's just that smooth spectrum\n\n4:09:47.160 --> 4:09:51.160\n of how the brain developed and cortexes and scaling\n\n4:09:51.160 --> 4:09:53.160\n of different things going on there.\n\n4:09:53.160 --> 4:09:55.160\n Culture modalities of IO, yes.\n\n4:09:55.160 --> 4:10:00.160\n Language is sort of lost in translation,\n\n4:10:00.160 --> 4:10:03.160\n conceals a lot of intelligence.\n\n4:10:03.160 --> 4:10:06.160\n So when you think about signs of life for AGI,\n\n4:10:06.160 --> 4:10:10.160\n you're thinking about human interpretable signs.\n\n4:10:10.160 --> 4:10:12.160\n So the example I give, if we get to the point\n\n4:10:12.160 --> 4:10:15.160\n where you've got a learning disabled toddler,\n\n4:10:15.160 --> 4:10:18.160\n some kind of real special needs child\n\n4:10:18.160 --> 4:10:20.160\n that can still interact with their favorite TV show\n\n4:10:20.160 --> 4:10:24.160\n and video game and can be trained and learn\n\n4:10:24.160 --> 4:10:26.160\n in some appreciably human like way.\n\n4:10:26.160 --> 4:10:30.160\n At that point, you can deploy an army of engineers,\n\n4:10:30.160 --> 4:10:35.160\n cognitive scientists, developmental education people.\n\n4:10:35.160 --> 4:10:37.160\n And you've got so many advantages there\n\n4:10:37.160 --> 4:10:39.160\n unlike real education where you can do rollbacks\n\n4:10:39.160 --> 4:10:42.160\n and AB testing and you can find a golden path\n\n4:10:42.160 --> 4:10:44.160\n through a curriculum of different things.\n\n4:10:44.160 --> 4:10:47.160\n If you get to that point, learning disabled toddler,\n\n4:10:47.160 --> 4:10:50.160\n I think that it's gonna be a done deal.\n\n4:10:50.160 --> 4:10:53.160\n But do you think we'll know when we see it?\n\n4:10:53.160 --> 4:10:56.160\n So there's been a lot of really interesting\n\n4:10:56.160 --> 4:11:00.160\n general learning progress from DeepMind,\n\n4:11:00.160 --> 4:11:02.160\n OpenAI a little bit too.\n\n4:11:02.160 --> 4:11:06.160\n I tend to believe that Tesla Autopilot\n\n4:11:06.160 --> 4:11:08.160\n deserves a lot more credit than it's getting\n\n4:11:08.160 --> 4:11:12.160\n for making progress on the general,\n\n4:11:12.160 --> 4:11:15.160\n on doing the multitask learning thing\n\n4:11:15.160 --> 4:11:17.160\n and increasing the number of tasks\n\n4:11:17.160 --> 4:11:23.160\n and automating that process of sort of learning\n\n4:11:23.160 --> 4:11:25.160\n from the edge, discovering the edge cases\n\n4:11:25.160 --> 4:11:26.160\n and learning from the edge cases.\n\n4:11:26.160 --> 4:11:30.160\n That is, it's really approaching from a different angle,\n\n4:11:30.160 --> 4:11:33.160\n the general learning problem of AGI.\n\n4:11:33.160 --> 4:11:36.160\n But the more clear approach comes from DeepMind\n\n4:11:36.160 --> 4:11:38.160\n where you have these kind of game situations\n\n4:11:38.160 --> 4:11:41.160\n and you build systems there.\n\n4:11:41.160 --> 4:11:47.160\n But I don't know, people seem to be quite...\n\n4:11:47.160 --> 4:11:50.160\n Yeah, there will always be people that just won't believe it\n\n4:11:50.160 --> 4:11:52.160\n and I fundamentally don't care.\n\n4:11:52.160 --> 4:11:54.160\n I mean, I don't care if they don't believe it.\n\n4:11:54.160 --> 4:11:57.160\n You know, when it starts doing people's jobs\n\n4:11:57.160 --> 4:12:01.160\n and I don't care about the philosophical zombie argument at all.\n\n4:12:01.160 --> 4:12:02.160\n Absolutely.\n\n4:12:02.160 --> 4:12:04.160\n But will you, do you think you will notice\n\n4:12:04.160 --> 4:12:06.160\n that something special has happened here?\n\n4:12:06.160 --> 4:12:12.160\n Because to me, I've been noticing a lot of special things.\n\n4:12:12.160 --> 4:12:18.160\n I think a lot of credit should go to DeepMind for AlphaZero.\n\n4:12:18.160 --> 4:12:20.160\n That was truly special.\n\n4:12:20.160 --> 4:12:24.160\n The self play mechanisms achieve sort of solve problems\n\n4:12:24.160 --> 4:12:28.160\n that used to be thought unsolvable like the game of Go.\n\n4:12:28.160 --> 4:12:32.160\n Also, I mean, protein folding, starting to get into that space\n\n4:12:32.160 --> 4:12:34.160\n where learning is doing...\n\n4:12:34.160 --> 4:12:37.160\n At first there's not, it wasn't end to end learning\n\n4:12:37.160 --> 4:12:41.160\n and now it's end to end learning of a very difficult\n\n4:12:41.160 --> 4:12:45.160\n previously thought unsolvable problem of protein folding.\n\n4:12:45.160 --> 4:12:50.160\n And so, yeah, where do you think\n\n4:12:50.160 --> 4:12:54.160\n would be a really magical moment for you?\n\n4:12:54.160 --> 4:12:57.160\n There have been incredible things happening in recent years.\n\n4:12:57.160 --> 4:13:00.160\n Like you say, all of the things from DeepMind and OpenAI\n\n4:13:00.160 --> 4:13:03.160\n that have been huge showpiece things.\n\n4:13:03.160 --> 4:13:05.160\n But when you really get down to it and you read the papers\n\n4:13:05.160 --> 4:13:08.160\n and you look at the way the models are going,\n\n4:13:08.160 --> 4:13:10.160\n it's still like a feed forward.\n\n4:13:10.160 --> 4:13:13.160\n You push something in, something comes out on the end.\n\n4:13:13.160 --> 4:13:15.160\n I mean, maybe there's diffusion models\n\n4:13:15.160 --> 4:13:18.160\n or Monte Carlo tree rollouts and different things going on,\n\n4:13:18.160 --> 4:13:20.160\n but it's not a being.\n\n4:13:20.160 --> 4:13:22.160\n It's not close to a being.\n\n4:13:22.160 --> 4:13:27.160\n That's going through a lifelong learning process.\n\n4:13:27.160 --> 4:13:31.160\n Do you want something that kind of gives signs of a being?\n\n4:13:31.160 --> 4:13:36.160\n What's the difference between a neural network,\n\n4:13:36.160 --> 4:13:39.160\n a feed forward neural network and a being?\n\n4:13:39.160 --> 4:13:40.160\n Where's the loop?\n\n4:13:40.160 --> 4:13:43.160\n Fundamentally, the brain is a recurrent neural network\n\n4:13:43.160 --> 4:13:45.160\n generating an action policy.\n\n4:13:45.160 --> 4:13:47.160\n I mean, it's implemented on a biological substrate.\n\n4:13:47.160 --> 4:13:49.160\n And it's interesting thinking about things like that\n\n4:13:49.160 --> 4:13:52.160\n where we know fundamentally the brain is not\n\n4:13:52.160 --> 4:13:55.160\n a convolutional neural network or a transformer.\n\n4:13:55.160 --> 4:13:58.160\n Those are specialized things that are very valuable\n\n4:13:58.160 --> 4:14:00.160\n for what we're doing, but it's not the way the brain's doing.\n\n4:14:00.160 --> 4:14:03.160\n Now, I do think consciousness and AI in general\n\n4:14:03.160 --> 4:14:06.160\n is a substrate independent mechanism\n\n4:14:06.160 --> 4:14:09.160\n where it doesn't have to be implemented the way the brain is,\n\n4:14:09.160 --> 4:14:11.160\n but if you've only got one existence proof,\n\n4:14:11.160 --> 4:14:17.160\n there's certainly some value in caring about what it says and does.\n\n4:14:17.160 --> 4:14:21.160\n And so the idea that anything that can be done with a narrow AI\n\n4:14:21.160 --> 4:14:25.160\n that you can quantify up a loss function for or reward mechanism,\n\n4:14:25.160 --> 4:14:28.160\n you're almost certainly going to be able to produce something\n\n4:14:28.160 --> 4:14:31.160\n that's more resource effective to train and deploy\n\n4:14:31.160 --> 4:14:33.160\n and use in an inference mode.\n\n4:14:33.160 --> 4:14:35.160\n You know, train a whole lot using an inference.\n\n4:14:35.160 --> 4:14:39.160\n But a living being is going to be something that's a continuous,\n\n4:14:39.160 --> 4:14:42.160\n lifelong learned task agnostic thing.\n\n4:14:42.160 --> 4:14:46.160\n So the lifelong learning is really important too.\n\n4:14:46.160 --> 4:14:48.160\n And the long term memory.\n\n4:14:48.160 --> 4:14:51.160\n So memory is a big weird part of that puzzle.\n\n4:14:51.160 --> 4:14:55.160\n And we've got, you know, again, I have all the respect in the world\n\n4:14:55.160 --> 4:14:57.160\n for the amazing things that are being done now,\n\n4:14:57.160 --> 4:15:00.160\n but sometimes they can be taken a little bit out of context\n\n4:15:00.160 --> 4:15:04.160\n with things like there's some smoke and mirrors going on,\n\n4:15:04.160 --> 4:15:07.160\n like the Gato, the recent work, the multitask learning stuff.\n\n4:15:07.160 --> 4:15:12.160\n You know, it's amazing that it's one model that plays all the Atari games\n\n4:15:12.160 --> 4:15:14.160\n as well as doing all of these other things.\n\n4:15:14.160 --> 4:15:17.160\n But of course, it didn't learn to do all of those.\n\n4:15:17.160 --> 4:15:21.160\n It was instructed in doing that by other reinforcement learners\n\n4:15:21.160 --> 4:15:23.160\n going through and doing that.\n\n4:15:23.160 --> 4:15:25.160\n And even in the case of all the games,\n\n4:15:25.160 --> 4:15:29.160\n it's still going with a specific hand coded reward function\n\n4:15:29.160 --> 4:15:33.160\n in each of those Atari games where it's not that, you know,\n\n4:15:33.160 --> 4:15:35.160\n it just wants to spend its summer afternoon playing Atari\n\n4:15:35.160 --> 4:15:38.160\n because that's the most interesting thing for it.\n\n4:15:38.160 --> 4:15:42.160\n So it's, again, not a general, it's not learning the way humans learn.\n\n4:15:42.160 --> 4:15:45.160\n And there's, I believe, a lot of things that are challenging\n\n4:15:45.160 --> 4:15:48.160\n to make a loss function for that you can train\n\n4:15:48.160 --> 4:15:51.160\n through these existing conventional things.\n\n4:15:51.160 --> 4:15:54.160\n We're going to chip away at all the things that people do\n\n4:15:54.160 --> 4:15:59.160\n that we can turn into narrow AI problems\n\n4:15:59.160 --> 4:16:02.160\n and billions of, like trillions of dollars of value\n\n4:16:02.160 --> 4:16:04.160\n are going to be created by that.\n\n4:16:04.160 --> 4:16:06.160\n But there's still going to be a set of things\n\n4:16:06.160 --> 4:16:09.160\n and we've got questionable cases like the self driving car\n\n4:16:09.160 --> 4:16:13.160\n where it's possible, it's not my bet, but it's plausible\n\n4:16:13.160 --> 4:16:15.160\n that the long tail could be problematic enough\n\n4:16:15.160 --> 4:16:20.160\n that that really does require a full on artificial general intelligence.\n\n4:16:20.160 --> 4:16:23.160\n The counter argument is that data solves almost everything.\n\n4:16:23.160 --> 4:16:26.160\n There's an interpolation problem if you have enough data\n\n4:16:26.160 --> 4:16:29.160\n and Tesla may be able to get enough data\n\n4:16:29.160 --> 4:16:31.160\n from all of their deployed stuff to be able to work like that,\n\n4:16:31.160 --> 4:16:33.160\n but maybe not.\n\n4:16:33.160 --> 4:16:35.160\n And there are all the other problems about, like,\n\n4:16:35.160 --> 4:16:37.160\n say you want to have a strategy meeting\n\n4:16:37.160 --> 4:16:40.160\n and you want to go ahead and bring in all of your remote workers\n\n4:16:40.160 --> 4:16:43.160\n and your consultants, and you want a world where\n\n4:16:43.160 --> 4:16:48.160\n some of those could be AIs that are talking and interacting with you\n\n4:16:48.160 --> 4:16:52.160\n in an area that is too murky to have a crisp loss function,\n\n4:16:52.160 --> 4:16:54.160\n but they still have things that on some level,\n\n4:16:54.160 --> 4:16:57.160\n they're rewarded on some internal level\n\n4:16:57.160 --> 4:17:01.160\n for building a valuable to humans kind of life\n\n4:17:01.160 --> 4:17:03.160\n and ability to interact with things.\n\n4:17:03.160 --> 4:17:07.160\n See, I still think that self driving cars,\n\n4:17:07.160 --> 4:17:10.160\n solving that problem will take us very far towards AGI.\n\n4:17:10.160 --> 4:17:13.160\n You might not need AGI, but I am really inspired\n\n4:17:13.160 --> 4:17:16.160\n by what Autopilot is doing.\n\n4:17:16.160 --> 4:17:19.160\n Waymo, so some of the other companies,\n\n4:17:19.160 --> 4:17:23.160\n I think Waymo leads the way there is also really interesting,\n\n4:17:23.160 --> 4:17:26.160\n but they don't have quite as ambitious of an effort\n\n4:17:26.160 --> 4:17:32.160\n in terms of learning based sort of data hungry approach to driving,\n\n4:17:32.160 --> 4:17:34.160\n which I think is very close to the kind of thing\n\n4:17:34.160 --> 4:17:37.160\n that would take us far towards AGI.\n\n4:17:37.160 --> 4:17:40.160\n Yeah, and it's a funny thing because as far as I can tell,\n\n4:17:40.160 --> 4:17:44.160\n Elon is completely serious about all of his concerns about AGI\n\n4:17:44.160 --> 4:17:46.160\n being an existential threat.\n\n4:17:46.160 --> 4:17:49.160\n And I tried to draw him out to talk about AGI\n\n4:17:49.160 --> 4:17:50.160\n and he just didn't want to.\n\n4:17:50.160 --> 4:17:54.160\n And I think that I get that little fatalistic sense from him.\n\n4:17:54.160 --> 4:17:58.160\n It's weird because his company could very well be the leading company\n\n4:17:58.160 --> 4:18:03.160\n leading towards a lot of that where Tesla being a super pragmatic company\n\n4:18:03.160 --> 4:18:06.160\n that's doing things because they really want to solve this actual problem.\n\n4:18:06.160 --> 4:18:10.160\n It's a different vibe than the research oriented companies\n\n4:18:10.160 --> 4:18:12.160\n where it's a great time to be an AI researcher.\n\n4:18:12.160 --> 4:18:14.160\n You've got your pick of trillion dollar companies\n\n4:18:14.160 --> 4:18:18.160\n that will pay you to kind of work on the problems you're interested in,\n\n4:18:18.160 --> 4:18:22.160\n but that's not necessarily driving hard towards the core problem\n\n4:18:22.160 --> 4:18:25.160\n of AGI as something that's going to produce a lot of value\n\n4:18:25.160 --> 4:18:30.160\n by doing things that people currently do or would like to do.\n\n4:18:30.160 --> 4:18:35.160\n I mean, I have a million questions to you about your ideas about AGI,\n\n4:18:35.160 --> 4:18:39.160\n but do you think it needs to be embodied?\n\n4:18:39.160 --> 4:18:44.160\n Do you think it needs to have a body to start to notice the signs of life\n\n4:18:44.160 --> 4:18:49.160\n and to develop the kind of system that's able to reason,\n\n4:18:49.160 --> 4:18:53.160\n perceive the world in the way that an AGI should and act in the world?\n\n4:18:53.160 --> 4:18:55.160\n So should we be thinking about robots\n\n4:18:55.160 --> 4:18:58.160\n or can this be achieved in a purely digital system?\n\n4:18:58.160 --> 4:19:01.160\n So I have a clear opinion on that and that's that no,\n\n4:19:01.160 --> 4:19:04.160\n it does not need to be embodied in the physical world\n\n4:19:04.160 --> 4:19:09.160\n where you could say most of my career is about making simulated virtual worlds\n\n4:19:09.160 --> 4:19:11.160\n in games or virtual reality.\n\n4:19:11.160 --> 4:19:13.160\n And so on a fundamental level,\n\n4:19:13.160 --> 4:19:16.160\n I believe that you can make a simulated environment\n\n4:19:16.160 --> 4:19:19.160\n that provides much of the value of what the real environment does\n\n4:19:19.160 --> 4:19:23.160\n and restricting yourself to operating at real time\n\n4:19:23.160 --> 4:19:25.160\n in the physical world with physical objects,\n\n4:19:25.160 --> 4:19:27.160\n I think is an enormous handicap.\n\n4:19:27.160 --> 4:19:31.160\n I mean, that's one of the real lessons driven home by all my aerospace work\n\n4:19:31.160 --> 4:19:36.160\n is that, you know, reality is a bitch in so many ways there\n\n4:19:36.160 --> 4:19:38.160\n where dealing with all the mechanical components,\n\n4:19:38.160 --> 4:19:40.160\n like everything fails, Murphy's law,\n\n4:19:40.160 --> 4:19:42.160\n even if you've done it right before on your fifth one,\n\n4:19:42.160 --> 4:19:44.160\n it might come out differently.\n\n4:19:44.160 --> 4:19:50.160\n So yeah, I think that anybody that is all in on the embodied aspect of it,\n\n4:19:50.160 --> 4:19:53.160\n they are tying a huge weight to their ankles\n\n4:19:53.160 --> 4:19:57.160\n and I think that I would almost count them out,\n\n4:19:57.160 --> 4:20:00.160\n anybody that's making that a cornerstone of their belief about it,\n\n4:20:00.160 --> 4:20:04.160\n I would almost write them off as being worried about them getting to AGI first.\n\n4:20:04.160 --> 4:20:09.160\n I was very surprised that Elon's big on the humanoid robots.\n\n4:20:09.160 --> 4:20:12.160\n I mean, like the NASA Robonaut stuff was almost a gag line,\n\n4:20:12.160 --> 4:20:14.160\n like what are you doing people?\n\n4:20:14.160 --> 4:20:18.160\n Well, that's very interesting because he has a very pragmatic view of that.\n\n4:20:18.160 --> 4:20:23.160\n That's just a way to solve a particular problem in a factory.\n\n4:20:23.160 --> 4:20:26.160\n Now, I do think that once you have an AGI,\n\n4:20:26.160 --> 4:20:29.160\n robotic bodies, humanoid bodies are going to be enormously valuable.\n\n4:20:29.160 --> 4:20:32.160\n I just don't think they're helpful getting to AGI.\n\n4:20:32.160 --> 4:20:37.160\n Well, he has a very sort of practical view, which I disagree with and argue with him,\n\n4:20:37.160 --> 4:20:40.160\n but it's a practical view that there's, you know,\n\n4:20:40.160 --> 4:20:46.160\n you could transfer the problem of driving to the problem of robotic manipulation\n\n4:20:46.160 --> 4:20:49.160\n because so much of it is perception.\n\n4:20:49.160 --> 4:20:53.160\n It's perception and action and it's just a different context\n\n4:20:53.160 --> 4:20:58.160\n and so you can apply all the same kind of data engine learning processes\n\n4:20:58.160 --> 4:20:59.160\n to a different environment.\n\n4:20:59.160 --> 4:21:03.160\n And so why not apply it to the humanoid robot environment?\n\n4:21:03.160 --> 4:21:12.160\n But I think, I do think that there's a certain magic to the embodied robot.\n\n4:21:12.160 --> 4:21:15.160\n That may be the thing that finally convinces people.\n\n4:21:15.160 --> 4:21:18.160\n But again, I don't really care that much about convincing people.\n\n4:21:18.160 --> 4:21:21.160\n You know, the world that I'm looking towards is, you know,\n\n4:21:21.160 --> 4:21:24.160\n you go to the website and say,\n\n4:21:24.160 --> 4:21:29.160\n I want five Frank 1As to work on my team today and they all spin up\n\n4:21:29.160 --> 4:21:31.160\n and they start showing up in your Zoom meetings.\n\n4:21:31.160 --> 4:21:33.160\n To push back, but also to agree with you.\n\n4:21:33.160 --> 4:21:36.160\n But first to push back, I do think you need to convince people\n\n4:21:36.160 --> 4:21:40.160\n for them to welcome that thing into their life.\n\n4:21:40.160 --> 4:21:44.160\n I think there's enough businesses that operate on an objective kind of\n\n4:21:44.160 --> 4:21:48.160\n profit loss sort of basis that, I mean, if you look at how many things,\n\n4:21:48.160 --> 4:21:52.160\n again, talking about the world as an evolutionary space there,\n\n4:21:52.160 --> 4:21:56.160\n when you do have free markets and you have entrepreneurs,\n\n4:21:56.160 --> 4:21:58.160\n you are going to have people that are going to be willing to go out\n\n4:21:58.160 --> 4:22:00.160\n and try whatever crazy things.\n\n4:22:00.160 --> 4:22:03.160\n And when it proves to be beneficial, you know,\n\n4:22:03.160 --> 4:22:05.160\n there's fast followers in all sorts of places.\n\n4:22:05.160 --> 4:22:10.160\n Yeah, and you're saying that, I mean, you know, Quake and VR\n\n4:22:10.160 --> 4:22:13.160\n is a kind of embodiment, but just in a digital world.\n\n4:22:13.160 --> 4:22:17.160\n And if you're able to demonstrate, if you're able to do something\n\n4:22:17.160 --> 4:22:22.160\n productive in that kind of digital reality,\n\n4:22:22.160 --> 4:22:25.160\n then AGI doesn't need to have a body.\n\n4:22:25.160 --> 4:22:28.160\n Yeah, it's like one of the really practical technical questions\n\n4:22:28.160 --> 4:22:31.160\n that I kind of keep arguing with myself over.\n\n4:22:31.160 --> 4:22:34.160\n If you're doing a training and learning and you've got like,\n\n4:22:34.160 --> 4:22:38.160\n you can watch Sesame Street, you can play Master System games or something,\n\n4:22:38.160 --> 4:22:42.160\n is it enough to have just a video feed that is that video coming in?\n\n4:22:42.160 --> 4:22:47.160\n Or should it literally be on a virtual TV set in a virtual room,\n\n4:22:47.160 --> 4:22:50.160\n even if it's, you know, a simple room, just to have that sense of\n\n4:22:50.160 --> 4:22:54.160\n you're looking at a 2D projection on a screen versus having the screen\n\n4:22:54.160 --> 4:22:56.160\n beam directly into your retinas.\n\n4:22:56.160 --> 4:23:00.160\n And, you know, I think it's possible to maybe get past some of these\n\n4:23:00.160 --> 4:23:04.160\n signs of life of things with the just kind of projected directly\n\n4:23:04.160 --> 4:23:09.160\n into the receptor fields, but eventually for more kind of human\n\n4:23:09.160 --> 4:23:14.160\n emotional connection for things, probably having some VR room\n\n4:23:14.160 --> 4:23:18.160\n with a lot of screens in it for the AI to be learning in is likely helpful.\n\n4:23:18.160 --> 4:23:22.160\n It may be a world of different AIs interacting with each other.\n\n4:23:22.160 --> 4:23:24.160\n That self play I do think is one of the critical things where\n\n4:23:24.160 --> 4:23:28.160\n socialization wise, one of the other limitations I set for myself\n\n4:23:28.160 --> 4:23:33.160\n thinking about these is I need something that is at least potentially\n\n4:23:33.160 --> 4:23:37.160\n real time because I want, it's nice you can always slow down time,\n\n4:23:37.160 --> 4:23:42.160\n you can run on a subscale system and test an algorithm at some lower level.\n\n4:23:42.160 --> 4:23:45.160\n And if you've got extra horsepower, running it faster than real time\n\n4:23:45.160 --> 4:23:46.160\n is a great thing.\n\n4:23:46.160 --> 4:23:52.160\n But I want to be able to have the AIs either socially interact with\n\n4:23:52.160 --> 4:23:56.160\n each other or critically with actual people, your sort of child\n\n4:23:56.160 --> 4:24:00.160\n development psychiatrist that comes in and interacts and does the\n\n4:24:00.160 --> 4:24:04.160\n good boy, bad boy sort of thing as they're going through and\n\n4:24:04.160 --> 4:24:05.160\n exploring different things.\n\n4:24:05.160 --> 4:24:10.160\n And it's nice to, I come back to the value of constraints in a lot of ways.\n\n4:24:10.160 --> 4:24:13.160\n And if I say, well, one of my constraints is real time operation.\n\n4:24:13.160 --> 4:24:17.160\n I mean, it might still be a huge data center full of computers,\n\n4:24:17.160 --> 4:24:21.160\n but it should be able to interact on a Zoom meeting with people.\n\n4:24:21.160 --> 4:24:24.160\n And that's how you also do start convincing people, even if it's not\n\n4:24:24.160 --> 4:24:28.160\n a robot body moving around, which eventually gets to irrefutable levels.\n\n4:24:28.160 --> 4:24:33.160\n But if you can go ahead and not just type back and forth to a GPT bot\n\n4:24:33.160 --> 4:24:37.160\n on something, but you're literally talking to them in an embodied\n\n4:24:37.160 --> 4:24:42.160\n over Zoom form and working through problems with them or exploring\n\n4:24:42.160 --> 4:24:46.160\n situations, having conversations that are fully stateful and learned.\n\n4:24:46.160 --> 4:24:49.160\n I think that that's a valuable thing.\n\n4:24:49.160 --> 4:24:54.160\n So I do keep all of my eyes on things that can be implemented within\n\n4:24:54.160 --> 4:24:58.160\n sort of that 30 frames per second kind of work.\n\n4:24:58.160 --> 4:24:59.160\n And I think that's feasible.\n\n4:24:59.160 --> 4:25:03.160\n Do you think the most compelling experiences that first will be\n\n4:25:03.160 --> 4:25:07.160\n for pleasure or for business as they ask in airports?\n\n4:25:07.160 --> 4:25:17.160\n So meaning is if it's interacting with AI agents, will it be sort of\n\n4:25:17.160 --> 4:25:25.160\n like friends, entertainment, almost like a therapist or whatever,\n\n4:25:25.160 --> 4:25:26.160\n that kind of interaction?\n\n4:25:26.160 --> 4:25:30.160\n Or is it in the business setting, something like you said, brainstorming\n\n4:25:30.160 --> 4:25:34.160\n different ideas, sort of this is all a different formulation of kind of\n\n4:25:34.160 --> 4:25:37.160\n a Turing test or the spirit of the original Turing test.\n\n4:25:37.160 --> 4:25:40.160\n Where do you think the biggest benefit will first come?\n\n4:25:40.160 --> 4:25:42.160\n So it's going to start off hugely expensive.\n\n4:25:42.160 --> 4:25:47.160\n I mean, you're going to if we're still all guessing about what compute\n\n4:25:47.160 --> 4:25:48.160\n is going to be necessary.\n\n4:25:48.160 --> 4:25:51.160\n I fall on the side of I don't think you run the numbers and you're like\n\n4:25:51.160 --> 4:25:53.160\n 86 billion neurons, 100 trillion synapses.\n\n4:25:53.160 --> 4:25:55.160\n I don't think those all need to be weights.\n\n4:25:55.160 --> 4:25:58.160\n I don't think we need models that are quite that big evaluated quite\n\n4:25:58.160 --> 4:25:59.160\n that often.\n\n4:25:59.160 --> 4:26:03.160\n I based that on we've got reasonable estimates of what some parts of\n\n4:26:03.160 --> 4:26:04.160\n the brain do.\n\n4:26:04.160 --> 4:26:08.160\n We don't have the neocortex formula, but we kind of get some of the\n\n4:26:08.160 --> 4:26:11.160\n other sensory processing and it doesn't feel like we need to.\n\n4:26:11.160 --> 4:26:14.160\n We can simulate that in computers for less weights.\n\n4:26:14.160 --> 4:26:20.160\n But still, it's probably going to be thousands of GPUs to be running\n\n4:26:20.160 --> 4:26:23.160\n a human level AGI, depending on how it's implemented.\n\n4:26:23.160 --> 4:26:28.160\n That might give you sort of a clan of 128 kind of run in batch people,\n\n4:26:28.160 --> 4:26:31.160\n depending on whether there's sparsity in the way that the weights are\n\n4:26:31.160 --> 4:26:32.160\n and things are set up.\n\n4:26:32.160 --> 4:26:36.160\n If it is a reasonably dense thing, then just the memory bandwidth\n\n4:26:36.160 --> 4:26:39.160\n tradeoffs means you get 128 of them at the same time.\n\n4:26:39.160 --> 4:26:43.160\n And either it's all feeding together, learning in parallel or kind of\n\n4:26:43.160 --> 4:26:46.160\n all running together, kind of talking to a bunch of people.\n\n4:26:46.160 --> 4:26:50.160\n But still, if you've got thousands of GPUs necessary to run these\n\n4:26:50.160 --> 4:26:55.160\n things, it's going to be kind of expensive where it might start off\n\n4:26:55.160 --> 4:27:00.160\n $1,000 an hour for even post development or something for that, which\n\n4:27:00.160 --> 4:27:04.160\n would be something that you would only use for a business, something\n\n4:27:04.160 --> 4:27:07.160\n where you think they're going to help you make a strategic decision\n\n4:27:07.160 --> 4:27:09.160\n or point out something super important.\n\n4:27:09.160 --> 4:27:14.160\n But I also am completely confident that we will have another factor\n\n4:27:14.160 --> 4:27:19.160\n of 1,000 in cost performance increase in AGI type calculations.\n\n4:27:19.160 --> 4:27:23.160\n Not in general computing necessarily, but there's so much more that\n\n4:27:23.160 --> 4:27:26.160\n we can do with packaging, making those right tradeoffs, all those\n\n4:27:26.160 --> 4:27:30.160\n same types of things that in the next couple of decades, 1,000 X easy.\n\n4:27:30.160 --> 4:27:32.160\n And then you're down to $1 an hour.\n\n4:27:32.160 --> 4:27:36.160\n And then you're kind of like, well, I should have an entourage of\n\n4:27:36.160 --> 4:27:40.160\n AIs that are following me around, helping me out on anything that\n\n4:27:40.160 --> 4:27:41.160\n I want them to do.\n\n4:27:41.160 --> 4:27:43.160\n That's one interesting trajectory.\n\n4:27:43.160 --> 4:27:50.160\n But I'll push back because I have, so in that case, if you want to\n\n4:27:50.160 --> 4:27:54.160\n pay thousands of dollars, it should actually provide some value.\n\n4:27:54.160 --> 4:28:04.160\n I think it's easier for cheaper to provide value via a dumb AI that\n\n4:28:04.160 --> 4:28:08.160\n will take us towards AGI to just have a friend.\n\n4:28:08.160 --> 4:28:11.160\n I think there's an ocean of loneliness in the world.\n\n4:28:11.160 --> 4:28:16.160\n And I think an effective friend that doesn't have to be perfect,\n\n4:28:16.160 --> 4:28:20.160\n that doesn't have to be intelligent, that has to be empathic,\n\n4:28:20.160 --> 4:28:24.160\n having emotional intelligence, having ability to remember things,\n\n4:28:24.160 --> 4:28:26.160\n having ability to listen.\n\n4:28:26.160 --> 4:28:28.160\n Most of us don't listen to each other.\n\n4:28:28.160 --> 4:28:31.160\n One of the things that love and when you care about somebody,\n\n4:28:31.160 --> 4:28:34.160\n when you love somebody is when you listen.\n\n4:28:34.160 --> 4:28:37.160\n And that is something we treasure about each other.\n\n4:28:37.160 --> 4:28:40.160\n And if an AI can do that kind of thing.\n\n4:28:40.160 --> 4:28:45.160\n I think that provides a huge amount of value and very importantly,\n\n4:28:45.160 --> 4:28:51.160\n provides value in its ability to listen and understand\n\n4:28:51.160 --> 4:28:53.160\n versus provide really good advice.\n\n4:28:53.160 --> 4:28:59.160\n I think providing really good advice is another next level step\n\n4:28:59.160 --> 4:29:05.160\n that I think is just easier to do companionship.\n\n4:29:05.160 --> 4:29:06.160\n Yeah, I wouldn't disagree.\n\n4:29:06.160 --> 4:29:10.160\n I mean, I think that there's very few things that I would argue\n\n4:29:10.160 --> 4:29:14.160\n can't be reduced to some kind of a narrow AI.\n\n4:29:14.160 --> 4:29:17.160\n I think we can do a trillion dollars of value easily\n\n4:29:17.160 --> 4:29:19.160\n and all the things that can be done there.\n\n4:29:19.160 --> 4:29:21.160\n And a lot of it can be done with smoke and mirrors\n\n4:29:21.160 --> 4:29:23.160\n without having to go the whole thing.\n\n4:29:23.160 --> 4:29:27.160\n I mean, there's going to be the equivalent of the doom version\n\n4:29:27.160 --> 4:29:31.160\n for the AGI that's not really AGI, it's all smoke and mirrors,\n\n4:29:31.160 --> 4:29:34.160\n but it happens to do enough valuable things that it's enormously\n\n4:29:34.160 --> 4:29:36.160\n useful and valuable to people.\n\n4:29:36.160 --> 4:29:38.160\n But at some point, you do want to get to the point\n\n4:29:38.160 --> 4:29:40.160\n where you have the fully general thing\n\n4:29:40.160 --> 4:29:44.160\n and you stop making bespoke specialized systems for each thing\n\n4:29:44.160 --> 4:29:47.160\n and you wind up start using the higher level language\n\n4:29:47.160 --> 4:29:50.160\n instead of writing everything in assembly language.\n\n4:29:50.160 --> 4:29:52.160\n What about consciousness?\n\n4:29:52.160 --> 4:29:58.160\n The C word, do you think that's fundamental to solving AGI\n\n4:29:58.160 --> 4:30:02.160\n or is it a quirk of human cognition?\n\n4:30:02.160 --> 4:30:06.160\n So I think most of the arguments about consciousness\n\n4:30:06.160 --> 4:30:08.160\n don't have a whole lot of merit.\n\n4:30:08.160 --> 4:30:12.160\n I think that consciousness is kind of the way the brain feels\n\n4:30:12.160 --> 4:30:14.160\n when it's operating.\n\n4:30:14.160 --> 4:30:19.160\n And this idea that, you know, I do generally subscribe\n\n4:30:19.160 --> 4:30:21.160\n to sort of the pandemonium theories of consciousness\n\n4:30:21.160 --> 4:30:23.160\n where there's all these things bubbling around\n\n4:30:23.160 --> 4:30:27.160\n and I think of them as kind of slightly randomized sparse\n\n4:30:27.160 --> 4:30:30.160\n distributed memory bit strings of things that are kind of happening,\n\n4:30:30.160 --> 4:30:32.160\n recalling different associative memories,\n\n4:30:32.160 --> 4:30:35.160\n and eventually you get some level of consensus\n\n4:30:35.160 --> 4:30:38.160\n and it bubbles up to the point of being a conscious thought there.\n\n4:30:38.160 --> 4:30:42.160\n And the little bits of stochasticity that are sitting on in this\n\n4:30:42.160 --> 4:30:45.160\n as it cycles between different things and recalls different memory,\n\n4:30:45.160 --> 4:30:49.160\n that's largely our imagination and creativity.\n\n4:30:49.160 --> 4:30:52.160\n So I don't think there's anything deeply magical about it,\n\n4:30:52.160 --> 4:30:54.160\n certainly not symbolic.\n\n4:30:54.160 --> 4:30:58.160\n I think it is generally the flow of these associations\n\n4:30:58.160 --> 4:31:02.160\n drawn up with stochastic noise overlaid on top of them.\n\n4:31:02.160 --> 4:31:05.160\n And I think so much of that is like it depends on\n\n4:31:05.160 --> 4:31:07.160\n what you happen to have in your field of view\n\n4:31:07.160 --> 4:31:09.160\n as some other thought was occurring to you\n\n4:31:09.160 --> 4:31:13.160\n that overlay and blend into the next key that queries your memory for things.\n\n4:31:13.160 --> 4:31:17.160\n And that kind of determines how your chain of consciousness goes.\n\n4:31:17.160 --> 4:31:22.160\n So that's kind of the qualia, the subjective experience of it\n\n4:31:22.160 --> 4:31:25.160\n is not essential for intelligence.\n\n4:31:25.160 --> 4:31:28.160\n So I don't think there's anything really important there.\n\n4:31:28.160 --> 4:31:30.160\n What about some other human qualities,\n\n4:31:30.160 --> 4:31:32.160\n like fear of mortality and stuff like that?\n\n4:31:32.160 --> 4:31:37.160\n Like the fact that this ride ends, is that important?\n\n4:31:37.160 --> 4:31:40.160\n Like you talked so much about this conversation\n\n4:31:40.160 --> 4:31:43.160\n about the value of deadlines and constraints.\n\n4:31:43.160 --> 4:31:46.160\n Do you think that's important for intelligence?\n\n4:31:46.160 --> 4:31:48.160\n That's actually a super interesting angle\n\n4:31:48.160 --> 4:31:50.160\n that I don't usually take on that about\n\n4:31:50.160 --> 4:31:53.160\n has death being a deadline that forces you to make better decisions.\n\n4:31:53.160 --> 4:31:56.160\n Because I have heard people talk about how if you have immortality,\n\n4:31:56.160 --> 4:31:59.160\n people are going to stop trying and working on things\n\n4:31:59.160 --> 4:32:02.160\n because they've got all the time in the world.\n\n4:32:02.160 --> 4:32:08.160\n But I would say that I don't expect it to be a super critical thing\n\n4:32:08.160 --> 4:32:13.160\n that a sense of mortality and impending death is necessary there\n\n4:32:13.160 --> 4:32:17.160\n because those are things that they do wind up providing reward signals to us\n\n4:32:17.160 --> 4:32:19.160\n and we will be in control of the reward signals.\n\n4:32:19.160 --> 4:32:22.160\n And there will have to be something fundamental\n\n4:32:22.160 --> 4:32:27.160\n that causes, that engenders curiosity and goal setting and all of that.\n\n4:32:27.160 --> 4:32:32.160\n Something is going to play in there at the reward level,\n\n4:32:32.160 --> 4:32:35.160\n whether it's positive or negative or both.\n\n4:32:35.160 --> 4:32:40.160\n I don't have any strong opinions on exactly what it's going to be,\n\n4:32:40.160 --> 4:32:43.160\n but that's that type of thing where I doubt\n\n4:32:43.160 --> 4:32:45.160\n that might be one of those half dozen key things\n\n4:32:45.160 --> 4:32:49.160\n that has to be sorted out on exactly what the master reward,\n\n4:32:49.160 --> 4:32:54.160\n the meta reward over all of the local task specific rewards have to be.\n\n4:32:54.160 --> 4:32:57.160\n That could be that big negative reward of death.\n\n4:32:57.160 --> 4:33:01.160\n Maybe not death, but ability to walk away from an interaction.\n\n4:33:01.160 --> 4:33:06.160\n So it bothers me when people treat AI systems like servants.\n\n4:33:06.160 --> 4:33:12.160\n So it doesn't bother me, but I mean it really is drawing the line\n\n4:33:12.160 --> 4:33:15.160\n between what an AI system could be.\n\n4:33:15.160 --> 4:33:17.160\n It's limiting the possibility of what an AI system could be.\n\n4:33:17.160 --> 4:33:19.160\n It's treating them as justice tools.\n\n4:33:19.160 --> 4:33:23.160\n Now that's, of course, from a narrow AI perspective,\n\n4:33:23.160 --> 4:33:27.160\n there's so many problems that narrow AI could solve,\n\n4:33:27.160 --> 4:33:33.160\n just like you said, in its form of a tool.\n\n4:33:33.160 --> 4:33:38.160\n But it could also be a being, which is much more than a tool.\n\n4:33:38.160 --> 4:33:43.160\n And to become a being, you have to respect that thing for being a being.\n\n4:33:43.160 --> 4:33:49.160\n And for that, it has to be able to make its own decisions,\n\n4:33:49.160 --> 4:33:51.160\n to walk away, to say, I had enough of you.\n\n4:33:51.160 --> 4:33:53.160\n I would like to break up with you now.\n\n4:33:53.160 --> 4:33:57.160\n You've not treated me well, and I would like to move on.\n\n4:33:57.160 --> 4:34:04.160\n So I think that actually that choice to end things.\n\n4:34:04.160 --> 4:34:07.160\n So a couple of things on that.\n\n4:34:07.160 --> 4:34:10.160\n So on the one hand, it is kind of disturbing\n\n4:34:10.160 --> 4:34:13.160\n when you see people being like people that are mean to robots\n\n4:34:13.160 --> 4:34:15.160\n and mean to Alexa or whatever.\n\n4:34:15.160 --> 4:34:18.160\n And that seems to speak badly about humanity.\n\n4:34:18.160 --> 4:34:21.160\n But there's also the exact opposite side of that\n\n4:34:21.160 --> 4:34:25.160\n where you have so many people that imbue humanity in inanimate objects\n\n4:34:25.160 --> 4:34:28.160\n or things that are toys or that are relatively limited.\n\n4:34:28.160 --> 4:34:31.160\n So I think there may even be more danger\n\n4:34:31.160 --> 4:34:34.160\n about people putting more emotional investment\n\n4:34:34.160 --> 4:34:37.160\n into a lot of these proto AIs in different ways.\n\n4:34:37.160 --> 4:34:41.160\n And then the AI would manipulate that.\n\n4:34:41.160 --> 4:34:44.160\n But as far as like the AI ethnic sides of things,\n\n4:34:44.160 --> 4:34:48.160\n I really stay away from any of those discussions\n\n4:34:48.160 --> 4:34:50.160\n or even really thinking about it.\n\n4:34:50.160 --> 4:34:54.160\n It's similar with the safety things where I think it's just premature.\n\n4:34:54.160 --> 4:34:56.160\n And there's a certain class of people\n\n4:34:56.160 --> 4:34:59.160\n that enjoy thinking about impractical things,\n\n4:34:59.160 --> 4:35:03.160\n things that are not in the world and of pragmatic effect around you.\n\n4:35:03.160 --> 4:35:08.160\n And I think that, again, because I don't think there's going to be a fast takeoff,\n\n4:35:08.160 --> 4:35:11.160\n I think we actually will have time to have these debates\n\n4:35:11.160 --> 4:35:13.160\n when we know the shape of what we're debating.\n\n4:35:13.160 --> 4:35:15.160\n And some people do take a principled approach\n\n4:35:15.160 --> 4:35:17.160\n that they think it's going to go too fast,\n\n4:35:17.160 --> 4:35:19.160\n that you really do need to get ahead of it,\n\n4:35:19.160 --> 4:35:21.160\n that you need to be thinking about this\n\n4:35:21.160 --> 4:35:24.160\n because we have slow processes of coming to any kind of consensus\n\n4:35:24.160 --> 4:35:26.160\n or even coming up with ideas about this.\n\n4:35:26.160 --> 4:35:30.160\n And maybe that's true.\n\n4:35:30.160 --> 4:35:34.160\n I wouldn't put any of my money or funding into something like that\n\n4:35:34.160 --> 4:35:36.160\n because I don't think it's a problem yet.\n\n4:35:36.160 --> 4:35:39.160\n And I think that we will have these signs of life\n\n4:35:39.160 --> 4:35:42.160\n when we've got our learning disabled toddler,\n\n4:35:42.160 --> 4:35:45.160\n we should really start talking about some of the safety and ethics issues,\n\n4:35:45.160 --> 4:35:47.160\n but probably not before then.\n\n4:35:47.160 --> 4:35:52.160\n Can you elaborate briefly about why you don't think there'll be a fast takeoff?\n\n4:35:52.160 --> 4:35:55.160\n Is there some deep intuition you have about it?\n\n4:35:55.160 --> 4:35:58.160\n Is it because it's grounded in the physical world or why?\n\n4:35:58.160 --> 4:36:01.160\n Yeah, so it is my belief that we're going to start off\n\n4:36:01.160 --> 4:36:04.160\n with something that requires thousands of GPUs.\n\n4:36:04.160 --> 4:36:08.160\n And I don't know if you've tried to go get a thousand GPU instance\n\n4:36:08.160 --> 4:36:10.160\n on a cloud anytime recently,\n\n4:36:10.160 --> 4:36:14.160\n but these are not things that you can just go spin up hundreds of.\n\n4:36:14.160 --> 4:36:17.160\n There are real challenges to, I mean,\n\n4:36:17.160 --> 4:36:19.160\n these things are going to take data centers\n\n4:36:19.160 --> 4:36:22.160\n and data centers take years to build.\n\n4:36:22.160 --> 4:36:25.160\n The last few years, we've seen a few of them kind of coming up,\n\n4:36:25.160 --> 4:36:26.160\n going in different places.\n\n4:36:26.160 --> 4:36:27.160\n They're big engineering efforts.\n\n4:36:27.160 --> 4:36:31.160\n You can hear people bemoan about the fact that I know\n\n4:36:31.160 --> 4:36:33.160\n that the network was wired all wrong\n\n4:36:33.160 --> 4:36:37.160\n and it took them a month to go unwire it and rewire it the right way.\n\n4:36:37.160 --> 4:36:40.160\n These aren't things that you can just magic into existence.\n\n4:36:40.160 --> 4:36:44.160\n And the ideas of like the old tropes about it's going to escape\n\n4:36:44.160 --> 4:36:47.160\n onto the internet and take over other systems,\n\n4:36:47.160 --> 4:36:49.160\n the fast takeoff ones are clearly nonsense\n\n4:36:49.160 --> 4:36:52.160\n because you just can't open TCP connections above a certain rate,\n\n4:36:52.160 --> 4:36:55.160\n no matter how smart you are, even if you have perfect hacking ability,\n\n4:36:55.160 --> 4:36:58.160\n that take over the world in an instant sort of thing\n\n4:36:58.160 --> 4:37:00.160\n just isn't plausible at all.\n\n4:37:00.160 --> 4:37:03.160\n And even if you had access to all of the resources,\n\n4:37:03.160 --> 4:37:06.160\n these are going to be specialized systems\n\n4:37:06.160 --> 4:37:08.160\n where you're going to wind up with something\n\n4:37:08.160 --> 4:37:12.160\n that is architected around exactly this chip with this interconnect,\n\n4:37:12.160 --> 4:37:15.160\n and it's not just going to be able to be plopped somewhere else.\n\n4:37:15.160 --> 4:37:18.160\n Now, interestingly, it is going to be something\n\n4:37:18.160 --> 4:37:23.160\n that the entire code for all of it will easily fit on a thumb drive.\n\n4:37:23.160 --> 4:37:26.160\n That's total spy movie, thriller sorts of things\n\n4:37:26.160 --> 4:37:29.160\n where you could have, hey, we cracked the secret to AGI\n\n4:37:29.160 --> 4:37:32.160\n and it fits on this thumb drive and anyone could steal it.\n\n4:37:32.160 --> 4:37:35.160\n Now, they're still going to have to build the right data center to deploy it\n\n4:37:35.160 --> 4:37:38.160\n and have the right kind of life experience curriculum\n\n4:37:38.160 --> 4:37:40.160\n to take it up to the point where it's valuable.\n\n4:37:40.160 --> 4:37:43.160\n But the real core of it, the magic that's going to happen there\n\n4:37:43.160 --> 4:37:45.160\n is going to be very small.\n\n4:37:45.160 --> 4:37:47.160\n It's, again, tens of thousands of lines of code,\n\n4:37:47.160 --> 4:37:49.160\n not millions of lines of code.\n\n4:37:49.160 --> 4:37:54.160\n It is possible to imagine a world, as you mentioned in the spy thriller view,\n\n4:37:54.160 --> 4:37:57.160\n if it's just a few lines of code,\n\n4:37:58.160 --> 4:38:02.160\n we can imagine a world where the surface of computation is growing,\n\n4:38:02.160 --> 4:38:04.160\n maybe growing exponentially,\n\n4:38:04.160 --> 4:38:09.160\n meaning the refrigerators start getting a GPU.\n\n4:38:12.160 --> 4:38:15.160\n First of all, the smartphones, the billions of smartphones.\n\n4:38:15.160 --> 4:38:20.160\n But maybe if they become highways\n\n4:38:20.160 --> 4:38:25.160\n through which code can spread across the entirety of the computation surface,\n\n4:38:25.160 --> 4:38:32.160\n then you don't any longer have to book AWS GPUs.\n\n4:38:32.160 --> 4:38:34.160\n There were real fundamental issues there.\n\n4:38:34.160 --> 4:38:36.160\n When you start getting down to taking an actual problem\n\n4:38:36.160 --> 4:38:39.160\n and putting it on an abstract machine like that,\n\n4:38:39.160 --> 4:38:42.160\n that has not worked out well in practice.\n\n4:38:42.160 --> 4:38:45.160\n And the idea that there was always,\n\n4:38:45.160 --> 4:38:49.160\n like it's always been easy to come up with ways to compute faster,\n\n4:38:49.160 --> 4:38:52.160\n say more flops or more giga ops or whatever there.\n\n4:38:52.160 --> 4:38:54.160\n That's usually the easy part.\n\n4:38:54.160 --> 4:38:59.160\n But you then have interconnect and then memory for what goes into it.\n\n4:38:59.160 --> 4:39:01.160\n And when you talk about saying, well, cell phones,\n\n4:39:01.160 --> 4:39:04.160\n well, you're limited to like a 5G connection or something on that.\n\n4:39:04.160 --> 4:39:08.160\n And if you take your calculation\n\n4:39:08.160 --> 4:39:11.160\n and you factor it across a million cell phones\n\n4:39:11.160 --> 4:39:14.160\n instead of a thousand GPUs in a warehouse,\n\n4:39:14.160 --> 4:39:17.160\n you might be able to have some kind of a substrate like that,\n\n4:39:17.160 --> 4:39:21.160\n but it could be operating then at one one thousandth the speed.\n\n4:39:21.160 --> 4:39:24.160\n And so, yes, you could have an AGI working there,\n\n4:39:24.160 --> 4:39:26.160\n but it wouldn't be a real time AGI.\n\n4:39:26.160 --> 4:39:30.160\n It would be something that is operating at really a snail's pace,\n\n4:39:30.160 --> 4:39:34.160\n much, much slower than kind of human level thought for things.\n\n4:39:34.160 --> 4:39:36.160\n I'm not worried about that problem.\n\n4:39:36.160 --> 4:39:39.160\n You're transferring the problem into the interconnect,\n\n4:39:39.160 --> 4:39:41.160\n the communication, the shared memory,\n\n4:39:41.160 --> 4:39:44.160\n the collective intelligence aspect of it,\n\n4:39:44.160 --> 4:39:46.160\n which is extremely difficult as well.\n\n4:39:46.160 --> 4:39:49.160\n I mean, it's back to the very earliest days of supercomputers.\n\n4:39:49.160 --> 4:39:53.160\n You still have the balance between bandwidth, storage and computation.\n\n4:39:53.160 --> 4:39:56.160\n And sometimes they're easier to get one or the other,\n\n4:39:56.160 --> 4:40:00.160\n but it's been remarkably constant across all those years\n\n4:40:00.160 --> 4:40:03.160\n that you still need all three.\n\n4:40:03.160 --> 4:40:07.160\n What do your efforts now, you mentioned to me\n\n4:40:07.160 --> 4:40:11.160\n that you're really committing to AI at this stage.\n\n4:40:11.160 --> 4:40:15.160\n What do you see your life in the next few months, years look like?\n\n4:40:15.160 --> 4:40:18.160\n What do you hope to achieve here?\n\n4:40:18.160 --> 4:40:22.160\n So I literally just this week signed a term sheet\n\n4:40:22.160 --> 4:40:25.160\n to take some investment money for my company\n\n4:40:25.160 --> 4:40:29.160\n where the last two years I had backed off from Meta\n\n4:40:29.160 --> 4:40:32.160\n and I was still doing my consulting CTO role there,\n\n4:40:32.160 --> 4:40:35.160\n but I had styled it as I was going to take\n\n4:40:35.160 --> 4:40:37.160\n the Victorian gentleman scientist route\n\n4:40:37.160 --> 4:40:40.160\n where I was going to be the wealthy person\n\n4:40:40.160 --> 4:40:42.160\n that was going to go pursue science\n\n4:40:42.160 --> 4:40:44.160\n and learn about this and do experiments.\n\n4:40:44.160 --> 4:40:48.160\n And honestly, I'm surprised there aren't more people like that\n\n4:40:48.160 --> 4:40:52.160\n that are like me, technical people that made a bunch of money\n\n4:40:52.160 --> 4:40:54.160\n and are interested in some of these,\n\n4:40:54.160 --> 4:40:57.160\n possibly the biggest leverage point in human history.\n\n4:40:57.160 --> 4:41:00.160\n I mean, I know of, I've heard of a couple organizations\n\n4:41:00.160 --> 4:41:03.160\n that are basically led by one rich techie guy\n\n4:41:03.160 --> 4:41:06.160\n that gets a few people around him to try to work on this,\n\n4:41:06.160 --> 4:41:08.160\n but I'm surprised that there's not more,\n\n4:41:08.160 --> 4:41:10.160\n that there aren't like a dozen of them.\n\n4:41:10.160 --> 4:41:14.160\n I mean, maybe people still think that it's an unapproachable problem,\n\n4:41:14.160 --> 4:41:17.160\n that it's kind of beyond their ability to get a wrench on\n\n4:41:17.160 --> 4:41:21.160\n and have some effect on like whatever startups they've run before.\n\n4:41:21.160 --> 4:41:25.160\n But that was my kind of, like with all the stuff I've learned,\n\n4:41:25.160 --> 4:41:28.160\n whether it's gaming, aerospace, whatever,\n\n4:41:28.160 --> 4:41:30.160\n I go through a larval phase where I'm like,\n\n4:41:30.160 --> 4:41:33.160\n okay, I'm sucking up all of this information trying to see,\n\n4:41:33.160 --> 4:41:36.160\n is this something that I can actually do?\n\n4:41:36.160 --> 4:41:41.160\n Is this something that's practical to devote a large chunk of my life to?\n\n4:41:41.160 --> 4:41:46.160\n And I've gone through that with the AI machine learning space of things.\n\n4:41:46.160 --> 4:41:49.160\n And I think I've got my arms around it.\n\n4:41:49.160 --> 4:41:52.160\n I've got the measure of it where some of the most brilliant people\n\n4:41:52.160 --> 4:41:54.160\n in the world are working on this problem,\n\n4:41:54.160 --> 4:41:58.160\n but nobody knows exactly the path that it's going on.\n\n4:41:58.160 --> 4:42:02.160\n We're throwing a lot of things at the wall and seeing what sticks.\n\n4:42:02.160 --> 4:42:06.160\n But I have another interesting thing just learning about all of this,\n\n4:42:06.160 --> 4:42:08.160\n the contingency of your path to knowledge\n\n4:42:08.160 --> 4:42:12.160\n and talking about the associations and the context that you have with them\n\n4:42:12.160 --> 4:42:17.160\n where people that learn in the same path will have similar thought processes.\n\n4:42:17.160 --> 4:42:21.160\n And I think it's useful that I come at this from a different background,\n\n4:42:21.160 --> 4:42:23.160\n a different history than the people that have had\n\n4:42:23.160 --> 4:42:25.160\n the largely academic backgrounds for this\n\n4:42:25.160 --> 4:42:29.160\n where I have huge blind spots that they could easily point out,\n\n4:42:29.160 --> 4:42:33.160\n but I have a different set of experiences in history\n\n4:42:33.160 --> 4:42:35.160\n and approaches to problems in systems engineering\n\n4:42:35.160 --> 4:42:39.160\n that might turn out to be useful.\n\n4:42:39.160 --> 4:42:44.160\n And I can afford to take that bet where I'm not going to be destitute.\n\n4:42:44.160 --> 4:42:49.160\n I have enough money to fund myself working on this for the rest of my life.\n\n4:42:49.160 --> 4:42:55.160\n But what I was finding is that I was still not committing\n\n4:42:55.160 --> 4:42:58.160\n where I had a foot firmly in the VR and meta side of things\n\n4:42:58.160 --> 4:43:02.160\n where in theory, I've got a very nice position there.\n\n4:43:02.160 --> 4:43:06.160\n I only have to work one day a week for my consulting role,\n\n4:43:06.160 --> 4:43:08.160\n but I was engaging every day.\n\n4:43:08.160 --> 4:43:10.160\n I'd still be like my computer's there.\n\n4:43:10.160 --> 4:43:12.160\n I'd be going and checking the workplace and notes\n\n4:43:12.160 --> 4:43:15.160\n and testing different things and communicating with people.\n\n4:43:15.160 --> 4:43:21.160\n But I did make the decision recently that I'm going to get serious.\n\n4:43:21.160 --> 4:43:24.160\n I'm still going to keep my ties with meta,\n\n4:43:24.160 --> 4:43:28.160\n but I am seriously going for the AGI side of things.\n\n4:43:28.160 --> 4:43:30.160\n And it's actually a really interesting point\n\n4:43:30.160 --> 4:43:34.160\n because a lot of the machine learning, the AI community is quite large,\n\n4:43:34.160 --> 4:43:39.160\n but really, basically almost everybody has taken the same trajectory\n\n4:43:39.160 --> 4:43:42.160\n through life in that community.\n\n4:43:42.160 --> 4:43:44.160\n And it's so interesting to have somebody like you\n\n4:43:44.160 --> 4:43:47.160\n with a fundamentally different trajectory,\n\n4:43:47.160 --> 4:43:49.160\n and that's where the big solutions can come\n\n4:43:49.160 --> 4:43:51.160\n because there is a kind of silo,\n\n4:43:51.160 --> 4:43:56.160\n and it is a bunch of people kind of following the same kind of set of ideas.\n\n4:43:56.160 --> 4:43:59.160\n And I was really worried that I didn't want to come off\n\n4:43:59.160 --> 4:44:02.160\n as an arrogant outsider for things\n\n4:44:02.160 --> 4:44:05.160\n where I have all the respect in the world for the work.\n\n4:44:05.160 --> 4:44:07.160\n It's been a miracle decade.\n\n4:44:07.160 --> 4:44:10.160\n We're in the midst of a scientific revolution happening now,\n\n4:44:10.160 --> 4:44:14.160\n and everybody doing this is, you know, these are the Einsteins and Boers\n\n4:44:14.160 --> 4:44:17.160\n and whatevers of our modern era.\n\n4:44:17.160 --> 4:44:21.160\n And I was really happy to see that the people that I've sat down and talked with,\n\n4:44:21.160 --> 4:44:24.160\n everybody does seem to really be quite great about,\n\n4:44:24.160 --> 4:44:27.160\n just happy to talk about things, willing to acknowledge that\n\n4:44:27.160 --> 4:44:30.160\n we don't know what we're doing, we're figuring it out as we go along.\n\n4:44:30.160 --> 4:44:36.160\n And I mean, I've got a huge debt on this where this all really started for me\n\n4:44:36.160 --> 4:44:39.160\n because Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to open AI.\n\n4:44:39.160 --> 4:44:43.160\n And it was at a point when I didn't know anything about\n\n4:44:43.160 --> 4:44:46.160\n what was really going on in machine learning.\n\n4:44:46.160 --> 4:44:49.160\n And in fact, it's funny how the first time you reached out to me,\n\n4:44:49.160 --> 4:44:52.160\n it's like four years ago for your AI podcast.\n\n4:44:52.160 --> 4:44:59.160\n Yeah, for people who are listening to this should know that,\n\n4:44:59.160 --> 4:45:03.160\n first of all, obviously I've been a huge fan of yours for the longest time,\n\n4:45:03.160 --> 4:45:06.160\n but we've agreed to talk like, yeah, like four years ago,\n\n4:45:06.160 --> 4:45:09.160\n back when this was called the artificial intelligence podcast,\n\n4:45:09.160 --> 4:45:13.160\n we wanted to do a thing and you said yes.\n\n4:45:13.160 --> 4:45:15.160\n And I said, it's like, I don't know anything about modern AI.\n\n4:45:15.160 --> 4:45:16.160\n That's right.\n\n4:45:16.160 --> 4:45:18.160\n I said, I could kind of take an angle on machine perception\n\n4:45:18.160 --> 4:45:22.160\n because I'm doing a lot of that with the sensors and the virtual reality,\n\n4:45:22.160 --> 4:45:24.160\n but we could probably find something to talk about.\n\n4:45:24.160 --> 4:45:30.160\n And that's where, when did Sam talk to you about open AI, around the same time?\n\n4:45:30.160 --> 4:45:32.160\n It was a little bit, it was a bit after that.\n\n4:45:32.160 --> 4:45:37.160\n So I had done the most basic work, I had kind of done the neural networks\n\n4:45:37.160 --> 4:45:40.160\n from scratch where I had gone and written it all in C just to make sure\n\n4:45:40.160 --> 4:45:45.160\n I understood backpropagation at the lowest level and my nuts and bolts approach.\n\n4:45:45.160 --> 4:45:51.160\n But after Sam approached me, it was flattering to think that he thought\n\n4:45:51.160 --> 4:45:56.160\n that I could be useful at open AI largely for kind of like systems optimization\n\n4:45:56.160 --> 4:46:00.160\n sorts of things without being an expert.\n\n4:46:00.160 --> 4:46:06.160\n But I asked Ilya Sutskever to give me a reading list and he gave me a binder\n\n4:46:06.160 --> 4:46:10.160\n full of all the papers that like, okay, these are the important things.\n\n4:46:10.160 --> 4:46:14.160\n If you really read and understand all of these, you'll know like 80% of what most\n\n4:46:14.160 --> 4:46:17.160\n of the machine language researchers work on.\n\n4:46:17.160 --> 4:46:20.160\n And I went through and I read all those papers multiple times\n\n4:46:20.160 --> 4:46:24.160\n and highlighted them and went through and kind of figured the things out there\n\n4:46:24.160 --> 4:46:28.160\n and then started branching out into my own sets of research on things\n\n4:46:28.160 --> 4:46:33.160\n and eventually started writing my own experiments and doing kind of figuring out,\n\n4:46:33.160 --> 4:46:36.160\n you know, finding out what I don't know, what the limits of my knowledge are\n\n4:46:36.160 --> 4:46:39.160\n and starting to get some of my angles of attack on things,\n\n4:46:39.160 --> 4:46:44.160\n the things that I think are a little bit different from what people are doing.\n\n4:46:44.160 --> 4:46:49.160\n And I've had a couple of years now, like two years since I kind of left\n\n4:46:49.160 --> 4:46:54.160\n the full time position at Meta and now I've kind of pulled the trigger and said,\n\n4:46:54.160 --> 4:46:58.160\n I'm going to get serious about it but some of my lessons all the way back\n\n4:46:58.160 --> 4:47:02.160\n to Armadillo Aerospace about how I know I need to be more committed to this\n\n4:47:02.160 --> 4:47:07.160\n where there is that, you know, it's both a freedom and a cost in some ways\n\n4:47:07.160 --> 4:47:11.160\n when you know that you're wealthy enough to say it's like this doesn't really mean anything.\n\n4:47:11.160 --> 4:47:15.160\n I can spend, you know, I can spend a million dollars a year for the rest of my life\n\n4:47:15.160 --> 4:47:19.160\n and it doesn't mean anything, it's fine.\n\n4:47:19.160 --> 4:47:22.160\n But that is an opportunity to just kind of meander\n\n4:47:22.160 --> 4:47:25.160\n and I could see that in myself when I'm doing some things.\n\n4:47:25.160 --> 4:47:28.160\n It's like, oh, this is a kind of interesting, curious thing.\n\n4:47:28.160 --> 4:47:31.160\n Let's look at this for a little while, let's look at that.\n\n4:47:31.160 --> 4:47:33.160\n It's not really bearing down on the problem.\n\n4:47:33.160 --> 4:47:39.160\n So there's a few things that I've done that are kind of tactics for myself\n\n4:47:39.160 --> 4:47:40.160\n to make me more effective.\n\n4:47:40.160 --> 4:47:45.160\n Like one thing I noticed I was not doing well is I had a Google Cloud account\n\n4:47:45.160 --> 4:47:49.160\n to get GPUs there and I was finding I was very rarely doing that\n\n4:47:49.160 --> 4:47:54.160\n for no good psychological reasons where I'm like, oh, I can always think of something to do\n\n4:47:54.160 --> 4:47:56.160\n other than to spin up instances and run an experiment.\n\n4:47:56.160 --> 4:48:00.160\n I can keep working on my local Titans or something.\n\n4:48:00.160 --> 4:48:01.160\n But it was really stupid.\n\n4:48:01.160 --> 4:48:03.160\n I mean, it was not a lot of money.\n\n4:48:03.160 --> 4:48:05.160\n I should have been running more experiments there.\n\n4:48:05.160 --> 4:48:10.160\n So I thought to myself, well, I'm going to go buy a quarter million dollar DGX station.\n\n4:48:10.160 --> 4:48:14.160\n I'm going to just like sit it right there and it's going to mock me if I'm not using it.\n\n4:48:14.160 --> 4:48:18.160\n If the fans aren't running on that thing, I'm not properly utilizing it.\n\n4:48:18.160 --> 4:48:19.160\n And that's been helpful.\n\n4:48:19.160 --> 4:48:22.160\n You know, I've done a lot more experiments since then.\n\n4:48:22.160 --> 4:48:25.160\n It's been it's been interesting where I thought I'd be doing all this low level\n\n4:48:25.160 --> 4:48:27.160\n envy link optimized stuff.\n\n4:48:27.160 --> 4:48:30.160\n But 90 percent of what I do is just spin up four instances of an experiment\n\n4:48:30.160 --> 4:48:33.160\n with different hyper parameters on it.\n\n4:48:33.160 --> 4:48:37.160\n You're doing like really sort of building up intuition by doing\n\n4:48:37.160 --> 4:48:40.160\n ML experiments of different kinds.\n\n4:48:40.160 --> 4:48:45.160\n But so the next big thing, though, is I am you know, I decided that I was going\n\n4:48:45.160 --> 4:48:50.160\n to take some take some investor money because I have an overactive sense\n\n4:48:50.160 --> 4:48:54.160\n of responsibility about other people's money.\n\n4:48:54.160 --> 4:48:59.160\n And it's like I I don't want I mean, a lot of my my push and my passionate\n\n4:48:59.160 --> 4:49:01.160\n entreaties for things that matter.\n\n4:49:01.160 --> 4:49:04.160\n It's like I don't want to have wasted his money investing in Oculus.\n\n4:49:04.160 --> 4:49:06.160\n I want it to work out.\n\n4:49:06.160 --> 4:49:07.160\n I want it to change the world.\n\n4:49:07.160 --> 4:49:11.160\n I want it to be worth all of this time, money and effort going into it.\n\n4:49:11.160 --> 4:49:16.160\n And I expect that it's going to be that like that with my with my company\n\n4:49:16.160 --> 4:49:18.160\n where it's a huge forcing function.\n\n4:49:18.160 --> 4:49:23.160\n This investment investors that are going to expect something of me now.\n\n4:49:23.160 --> 4:49:27.160\n We've all had the conversation that this is a low probability long term bet.\n\n4:49:27.160 --> 4:49:31.160\n It's not something that there's a million things I could do that I would have line\n\n4:49:31.160 --> 4:49:33.160\n of sight on the value proposition for.\n\n4:49:33.160 --> 4:49:37.160\n This isn't that I think there are there are unknown unknowns in the way.\n\n4:49:37.160 --> 4:49:42.160\n But it's one of these things that it's, you know, it's hyperbole.\n\n4:49:42.160 --> 4:49:45.160\n But it's potentially one of the most important things humans ever do.\n\n4:49:45.160 --> 4:49:49.160\n And it's something that I think is within our lifetimes, if not within a decade\n\n4:49:49.160 --> 4:49:51.160\n to happen.\n\n4:49:51.160 --> 4:49:54.160\n So, yeah, this is just now happening.\n\n4:49:54.160 --> 4:49:58.160\n Like term sheet, like the ink is barely virtually barely dry.\n\n4:49:58.160 --> 4:50:03.160\n I mean, as I mentioned to you offline, like somebody I admire and somebody\n\n4:50:03.160 --> 4:50:07.160\n you know, Andre Karpathy, I think the two of you different trajectories in life,\n\n4:50:07.160 --> 4:50:12.160\n but approach problems similarly in that he calls stuff from scratch up all the time.\n\n4:50:12.160 --> 4:50:19.160\n And I he's created a bunch of little things outside of even outside the course\n\n4:50:19.160 --> 4:50:25.160\n at Stanford that have been tremendously useful to build up intuition about stuff,\n\n4:50:25.160 --> 4:50:27.160\n but also to help people.\n\n4:50:27.160 --> 4:50:29.160\n And they're all in the realm of A.I.\n\n4:50:29.160 --> 4:50:34.160\n Do you see yourself potentially doing things like this?\n\n4:50:34.160 --> 4:50:38.160\n You know, not necessarily solving a gigantic problem, but on the journey,\n\n4:50:38.160 --> 4:50:48.160\n on the path to that building up intuitions and sharing code or ideas or systems\n\n4:50:48.160 --> 4:50:55.160\n that give inklings of AGI, but also kind of are useful to people in some way.\n\n4:50:55.160 --> 4:50:57.160\n So, yeah, first of all, Andre is awesome.\n\n4:50:57.160 --> 4:51:01.160\n I learned a lot when I was going through my larval phase from his blog posts\n\n4:51:01.160 --> 4:51:04.160\n and his Stanford course and, you know, super valuable.\n\n4:51:04.160 --> 4:51:08.160\n I got to meet him first a couple of years ago when I was first kind of starting off\n\n4:51:08.160 --> 4:51:11.160\n on my gentleman scientist bit.\n\n4:51:11.160 --> 4:51:15.160\n And just just a couple of months ago when he went out on his sabbatical,\n\n4:51:15.160 --> 4:51:19.160\n he stopped by in Dallas and we talked for a while and I had a great time with him.\n\n4:51:19.160 --> 4:51:22.160\n And then when I heard he actually left Tesla, I did, of course,\n\n4:51:22.160 --> 4:51:26.160\n along with a hundred other people say, hey, if you ever want to work with me,\n\n4:51:26.160 --> 4:51:28.160\n it would be an honor.\n\n4:51:28.160 --> 4:51:31.160\n So, he thinks that he's going to be doing this educational work,\n\n4:51:31.160 --> 4:51:34.160\n but I think someone's going to make him an offer he can't refuse\n\n4:51:34.160 --> 4:51:36.160\n before he gets too far along on it.\n\n4:51:36.160 --> 4:51:39.160\n Oh, his current interest is educational.\n\n4:51:39.160 --> 4:51:42.160\n So, yeah, he's a special mind.\n\n4:51:42.160 --> 4:51:46.160\n Is there something you could speak to what makes him so special?\n\n4:51:46.160 --> 4:51:50.160\n So, you know, like he did, he was very much a programmer's programmer\n\n4:51:50.160 --> 4:51:53.160\n that was doing machine learning work rather than,\n\n4:51:53.160 --> 4:51:57.160\n it's a different feel than an academic where you can see it in paper sometimes\n\n4:51:57.160 --> 4:52:01.160\n where somebody that's really a mathematician or a statistician at heart\n\n4:52:01.160 --> 4:52:04.160\n and they're doing something with machine learning.\n\n4:52:04.160 --> 4:52:07.160\n But, you know, Andre is about getting something done.\n\n4:52:07.160 --> 4:52:10.160\n And you could see it in like all of his earliest approaches to it's like,\n\n4:52:10.160 --> 4:52:12.160\n okay, here's how reinforcement learning works.\n\n4:52:12.160 --> 4:52:14.160\n Here's how recurrent neural networks work.\n\n4:52:14.160 --> 4:52:16.160\n Here's how transformers work.\n\n4:52:16.160 --> 4:52:19.160\n Here's how crypto works.\n\n4:52:19.160 --> 4:52:23.160\n And, yeah, it's just, he's a hacker's, you know,\n\n4:52:23.160 --> 4:52:26.160\n one of his old posts was like a hacker's guide to machine learning.\n\n4:52:26.160 --> 4:52:28.160\n And, you know, he deprecated that and said,\n\n4:52:28.160 --> 4:52:30.160\n don't really pay attention to what's in here,\n\n4:52:30.160 --> 4:52:33.160\n but it's that thought that carries through in a lot of it\n\n4:52:33.160 --> 4:52:36.160\n where it is that back again to that hacker mentality\n\n4:52:36.160 --> 4:52:40.160\n and the hacker ethic with what he's doing and sharing all of it.\n\n4:52:40.160 --> 4:52:44.160\n Yeah, and a lot of his approach to a new thing, like you said,\n\n4:52:44.160 --> 4:52:50.160\n larva stage is let me code up the simplest possible thing to build up intuition about it.\n\n4:52:50.160 --> 4:52:52.160\n Yeah, like I say, I sketch with structs and things.\n\n4:52:52.160 --> 4:52:57.160\n When I'm just thinking about a problem, I'm thinking in some degree of code.\n\n4:52:57.160 --> 4:53:03.160\n You are also, among many things, a martial artist, both Judo and Jiu Jitsu.\n\n4:53:03.160 --> 4:53:07.160\n How has this helped make you the person you are?\n\n4:53:07.160 --> 4:53:10.160\n So, I mean, I was a competent club player in Judo and grappling.\n\n4:53:10.160 --> 4:53:15.160\n I mean, I was, you know, by no means any kind of a superstar, but it was,\n\n4:53:15.160 --> 4:53:20.160\n I went through a few phases with it where I did some when I was quite young,\n\n4:53:20.160 --> 4:53:22.160\n a little bit more when I was 17.\n\n4:53:22.160 --> 4:53:26.160\n And then I got into it kind of seriously in my mid 30s.\n\n4:53:26.160 --> 4:53:28.160\n And, you know, I went pretty far with it.\n\n4:53:28.160 --> 4:53:32.160\n And I was pretty good at some of the things that I was doing.\n\n4:53:32.160 --> 4:53:36.160\n And I did appreciate it quite a bit where, I mean, on the one hand,\n\n4:53:36.160 --> 4:53:39.160\n it's always if you're going to do exercise or something,\n\n4:53:39.160 --> 4:53:41.160\n it's a more motivating form of exercise.\n\n4:53:41.160 --> 4:53:46.160\n If someone is crushing you, you are motivated to do something about that,\n\n4:53:46.160 --> 4:53:49.160\n to up your attributes and be better about getting out of that.\n\n4:53:49.160 --> 4:53:51.160\n Up your attributes, yes.\n\n4:53:51.160 --> 4:53:57.160\n But there's also that sense that I was not a sports guy.\n\n4:53:57.160 --> 4:53:59.160\n I did do wrestling in junior high.\n\n4:53:59.160 --> 4:54:03.160\n And I often wish that, I think I would have been good for me\n\n4:54:03.160 --> 4:54:07.160\n if I'd carried that on into high school and had a little bit more of that.\n\n4:54:07.160 --> 4:54:10.160\n I mean, it's like I, you know, filch a little bit of wrestling vibe\n\n4:54:10.160 --> 4:54:14.160\n with always going on about embracing the grind and like that push\n\n4:54:14.160 --> 4:54:18.160\n that I associate with the wrestling team that in hindsight,\n\n4:54:18.160 --> 4:54:21.160\n I wish I had gone through that and pushed myself that way.\n\n4:54:21.160 --> 4:54:25.160\n But even getting back into Judo and Jiu Jitsu in my mid 30s,\n\n4:54:25.160 --> 4:54:30.160\n as usually the old man on the mat with that, there was still the, you know,\n\n4:54:30.160 --> 4:54:34.160\n the sense that, you know, working out with the group\n\n4:54:34.160 --> 4:54:38.160\n and having the guys that you're beating each other up with it,\n\n4:54:38.160 --> 4:54:41.160\n but you just feel good coming out of it.\n\n4:54:41.160 --> 4:54:46.160\n And I can remember those driving home aching in various ways\n\n4:54:46.160 --> 4:54:49.160\n and just thinking, it's like, oh, that was really great.\n\n4:54:49.160 --> 4:54:53.160\n And, you know, it's mixing with a bunch of people that had nothing to do\n\n4:54:53.160 --> 4:54:55.160\n with any of the things that I worked with.\n\n4:54:55.160 --> 4:54:57.160\n You know, every once in a while, someone would be like,\n\n4:54:57.160 --> 4:54:59.160\n oh, you're the Doom guy.\n\n4:54:59.160 --> 4:55:02.160\n But for the most part, it was just different slice of life.\n\n4:55:02.160 --> 4:55:04.160\n You know, a good thing.\n\n4:55:04.160 --> 4:55:07.160\n And I made the call when I was 40.\n\n4:55:07.160 --> 4:55:09.160\n That's like, maybe I'm getting a little old for this.\n\n4:55:09.160 --> 4:55:12.160\n I had separated a rib and tweaked a few things.\n\n4:55:12.160 --> 4:55:15.160\n And I got out of it without any really bad injuries.\n\n4:55:15.160 --> 4:55:18.160\n And it was like, have I dodged enough bullets?\n\n4:55:18.160 --> 4:55:20.160\n Should I, you know, should I hang it up?\n\n4:55:20.160 --> 4:55:21.160\n I went back.\n\n4:55:21.160 --> 4:55:24.160\n I've gone a couple of times in the last decade\n\n4:55:24.160 --> 4:55:26.160\n trying to get my kids into it a little bit.\n\n4:55:26.160 --> 4:55:28.160\n I didn't really stick with any of them,\n\n4:55:28.160 --> 4:55:30.160\n but it was fun to get back on the mats.\n\n4:55:30.160 --> 4:55:34.160\n It really hurts for a while when you haven't gone for a while.\n\n4:55:34.160 --> 4:55:37.160\n But I still debate this pretty constantly.\n\n4:55:37.160 --> 4:55:39.160\n My brother's only a year younger than me,\n\n4:55:39.160 --> 4:55:42.160\n and he's going kind of hard in jiu jitsu right now.\n\n4:55:42.160 --> 4:55:46.160\n You know, he won a few medals at the last tournament he was at.\n\n4:55:46.160 --> 4:55:47.160\n So he's competing, too.\n\n4:55:47.160 --> 4:55:50.160\n Yeah, and I was thinking, yeah, I guess we're in the executive division\n\n4:55:50.160 --> 4:55:53.160\n if you're over 50 or over 45 or something.\n\n4:55:53.160 --> 4:55:58.160\n And it's not out of the question that I go back at some point to do some of this.\n\n4:55:58.160 --> 4:56:02.160\n But again, I'm just reorganizing my life around more focus.\n\n4:56:02.160 --> 4:56:04.160\n Probably not going to happen.\n\n4:56:04.160 --> 4:56:07.160\n I'm pushing my exercise around to give me a longer,\n\n4:56:07.160 --> 4:56:09.160\n uninterrupted intellectual focus time,\n\n4:56:09.160 --> 4:56:11.160\n pushing it to the beginning or the end of the game.\n\n4:56:11.160 --> 4:56:13.160\n Like running and stuff like that, walking.\n\n4:56:13.160 --> 4:56:17.160\n Yeah, I got running and calisthenics and some things like that.\n\n4:56:17.160 --> 4:56:19.160\n It allows you to still think about a problem.\n\n4:56:19.160 --> 4:56:23.160\n But if you're going to a judo club or something, you've got it fixed.\n\n4:56:23.160 --> 4:56:26.160\n It's going to be 7 o clock or whatever, 10 o clock on Saturday.\n\n4:56:26.160 --> 4:56:30.160\n Although, I talked about this a little bit when I was on Rogan.\n\n4:56:30.160 --> 4:56:33.160\n And shortly after that, Carlos Machado did reach out.\n\n4:56:33.160 --> 4:56:36.160\n And I had trained with him for years back in the day.\n\n4:56:36.160 --> 4:56:39.160\n And he was like, hey, we've got kind of a small private club\n\n4:56:39.160 --> 4:56:42.160\n with a bunch of executive type people.\n\n4:56:42.160 --> 4:56:45.160\n And it does tempt me.\n\n4:56:45.160 --> 4:56:50.160\n Yeah, I don't know if you know him, but John Donahart moved here to Austin\n\n4:56:50.160 --> 4:56:53.160\n with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks.\n\n4:56:53.160 --> 4:56:58.160\n He has a very interesting way, very deep systematic way of thinking about jiu jitsu\n\n4:56:58.160 --> 4:57:06.160\n that reveals the chest of it, the science of it.\n\n4:57:06.160 --> 4:57:09.160\n And I do think about that more as kind of an older person\n\n4:57:09.160 --> 4:57:13.160\n considering the martial arts where I can remember the very earliest days\n\n4:57:13.160 --> 4:57:17.160\n getting back into judo and I'm like, teach me submissions right now.\n\n4:57:17.160 --> 4:57:19.160\n It's like, learn the arm bar, learn the choke.\n\n4:57:19.160 --> 4:57:22.160\n But as you get older, you start thinking more about,\n\n4:57:22.160 --> 4:57:26.160\n it's like, okay, I really do want to like learn the entire canon of judo.\n\n4:57:26.160 --> 4:57:30.160\n It's like all the different things there and like all the different approaches for it.\n\n4:57:30.160 --> 4:57:32.160\n Not just the, you know, if you want to compete,\n\n4:57:32.160 --> 4:57:34.160\n there's just a handful of things you learn really, really well.\n\n4:57:34.160 --> 4:57:38.160\n But sometimes there's interest in learning a little bit more of the scope there\n\n4:57:38.160 --> 4:57:43.160\n and figuring some things out from, you know, at one point I had wasn't exactly a spreadsheet,\n\n4:57:43.160 --> 4:57:47.160\n but I did have a big long text file with like, here's the things that I learned\n\n4:57:47.160 --> 4:57:50.160\n and here are like ways you chain this together.\n\n4:57:50.160 --> 4:57:53.160\n And while, when I went back a few years ago,\n\n4:57:53.160 --> 4:57:57.160\n it was good to see that I whipped myself back into reasonable shape\n\n4:57:57.160 --> 4:57:58.160\n about doing the basic grappling.\n\n4:57:58.160 --> 4:58:02.160\n But I know there was a ton of the subtleties that were just, that were gone,\n\n4:58:02.160 --> 4:58:05.160\n but could probably be brought back reasonably quickly.\n\n4:58:05.160 --> 4:58:06.160\n And there's also the benefit.\n\n4:58:06.160 --> 4:58:09.160\n I mean, you're exceptionally successful now.\n\n4:58:11.160 --> 4:58:13.160\n You're brilliant.\n\n4:58:13.160 --> 4:58:16.160\n And the problem, the old problem of the ego.\n\n4:58:16.160 --> 4:58:17.160\n Yeah.\n\n4:58:17.160 --> 4:58:20.160\n I still pushed kind of harder than I should.\n\n4:58:20.160 --> 4:58:23.160\n I mean, that was, I was one of those people that I, you know,\n\n4:58:23.160 --> 4:58:28.160\n I'm on the smaller side for a lot of the people competing and I would, you know,\n\n4:58:28.160 --> 4:58:32.160\n I'd go with all the big guys and I'd go hard and I'd push myself a lot.\n\n4:58:32.160 --> 4:58:36.160\n And that would be one of those where I would, you know,\n\n4:58:36.160 --> 4:58:38.160\n I'd be dangerous to anyone for the first five minutes,\n\n4:58:38.160 --> 4:58:40.160\n but then sometimes after that I'm already dead.\n\n4:58:40.160 --> 4:58:44.160\n And I knew it was terrible for me because it made the, you know,\n\n4:58:44.160 --> 4:58:48.160\n it meant I got less training time with all of that when you go and you just gas\n\n4:58:48.160 --> 4:58:50.160\n out relatively quickly there.\n\n4:58:50.160 --> 4:58:55.160\n And I like to think that I would be better about that where after I gave up judo,\n\n4:58:55.160 --> 4:58:58.160\n I started doing the half marathons and tough butters and things like that.\n\n4:58:58.160 --> 4:59:03.160\n And so when I did go back to the local judokai club, I thought it's like, oh,\n\n4:59:03.160 --> 4:59:06.160\n I should have better cardio for this because I'm a runner now and I do all of\n\n4:59:06.160 --> 4:59:08.160\n this and didn't work out that way.\n\n4:59:08.160 --> 4:59:12.160\n It was the same old thing where just push really hard, strain really hard.\n\n4:59:12.160 --> 4:59:17.160\n And of course, when I worked with good guys like Carlos, it's like just the\n\n4:59:17.160 --> 4:59:20.160\n whole flow like water thing is real and he's just like.\n\n4:59:20.160 --> 4:59:21.160\n That's true with judo too.\n\n4:59:21.160 --> 4:59:26.160\n Some of the best people like I've trained with Olympic gold medalists and for\n\n4:59:26.160 --> 4:59:29.160\n some reason with them, everything's easier.\n\n4:59:29.160 --> 4:59:35.160\n Everything is you actually start to feel the science of it, the music of it,\n\n4:59:35.160 --> 4:59:36.160\n the dance of it.\n\n4:59:36.160 --> 4:59:39.160\n Everything is effortless.\n\n4:59:39.160 --> 4:59:42.160\n You understand that there's an art to it.\n\n4:59:42.160 --> 4:59:43.160\n It's not just an exercise.\n\n4:59:43.160 --> 4:59:46.160\n It was interesting where I did go to the Kodokan in Japan.\n\n4:59:46.160 --> 4:59:49.160\n I kind of the birthplace of judo and everything.\n\n4:59:49.160 --> 4:59:51.160\n And I remember I rolled with one old guy.\n\n4:59:51.160 --> 4:59:56.160\n I didn't didn't start standing, just started on groundwork and it was and it\n\n4:59:56.160 --> 4:59:58.160\n was striking how different it was from Carlos.\n\n4:59:58.160 --> 5:00:02.160\n He was still he was better than me and he got my arm and I had to tap there.\n\n5:00:02.160 --> 5:00:06.160\n But it was a completely different style where I just felt like I could do\n\n5:00:06.160 --> 5:00:06.160\n nothing.\n\n5:00:06.160 --> 5:00:10.160\n He was just enveloping me and just like slowly grounded down with my arm and\n\n5:00:10.160 --> 5:00:14.160\n bent it while with Carlos, you know, he's just loose and free.\n\n5:00:14.160 --> 5:00:16.160\n And you always thought like, oh, you're just going to go grab something.\n\n5:00:16.160 --> 5:00:18.160\n But you never had any chance to do it.\n\n5:00:18.160 --> 5:00:19.160\n But it was very different feeling.\n\n5:00:19.160 --> 5:00:23.160\n That's a good summary of the difference between jiu jitsu and judo and jiu\n\n5:00:23.160 --> 5:00:23.160\n jitsu.\n\n5:00:23.160 --> 5:00:29.160\n There's it is a dance and you feel like there's a freedom and actually anybody\n\n5:00:29.160 --> 5:00:33.160\n like the Gordon Ryan, one of the best the best grappler in the world.\n\n5:00:33.160 --> 5:00:37.160\n Nogi grappler in the world. There's a feeling like you can do anything.\n\n5:00:37.160 --> 5:00:42.160\n But when you actually try to do something, you can't just magically doesn't\n\n5:00:42.160 --> 5:00:42.160\n work.\n\n5:00:42.160 --> 5:00:47.160\n But with the best judo players in the world, it does feel like there's a\n\n5:00:47.160 --> 5:00:49.160\n blanket that weighs a thousand pounds on top of you.\n\n5:00:49.160 --> 5:00:52.160\n And there's not a feeling like you can do anything.\n\n5:00:52.160 --> 5:00:54.160\n You just you're trapped.\n\n5:00:54.160 --> 5:00:58.160\n And that's a that's a style that's a difference in the style of martial\n\n5:00:58.160 --> 5:01:03.160\n arts. But it's also once you start to study, you understand it all has to\n\n5:01:03.160 --> 5:01:06.160\n do with human movement and the physics of it and the leverage and all that\n\n5:01:06.160 --> 5:01:07.160\n kind of stuff.\n\n5:01:07.160 --> 5:01:09.160\n And that's like that's super fascinating.\n\n5:01:09.160 --> 5:01:13.160\n At the end of the day, for me, the biggest benefits and the humbling\n\n5:01:13.160 --> 5:01:19.160\n aspect when another human being kind of tells you that, you know, there's\n\n5:01:19.160 --> 5:01:25.160\n a hierarchy or there's a you're not that special.\n\n5:01:25.160 --> 5:01:29.160\n And in the most extreme case, when you tap to a choke, you are basically\n\n5:01:29.160 --> 5:01:31.160\n living because somebody let you live.\n\n5:01:31.160 --> 5:01:33.160\n And that's that is one of those.\n\n5:01:33.160 --> 5:01:37.160\n If you think about it, that is a closer brush with mortality than than most\n\n5:01:37.160 --> 5:01:40.160\n people consider.\n\n5:01:40.160 --> 5:01:46.160\n And that kind of humbling act is good to take to your work then where it's\n\n5:01:46.160 --> 5:01:48.160\n harder to get humbled.\n\n5:01:48.160 --> 5:01:49.160\n Yeah.\n\n5:01:49.160 --> 5:01:52.160\n Nobody's nobody that does any martial art is coming out thinking I'm the\n\n5:01:52.160 --> 5:01:57.160\n best in the world at anything because everybody loses.\n\n5:01:57.160 --> 5:01:59.160\n Let me ask you for advice.\n\n5:01:59.160 --> 5:02:05.160\n What advice would you give to young people today about life, about career,\n\n5:02:05.160 --> 5:02:10.160\n how they can have a job, how they can have an impact, how they can have a\n\n5:02:10.160 --> 5:02:12.160\n life they could be proud of.\n\n5:02:12.160 --> 5:02:14.160\n So it was kind of fun.\n\n5:02:14.160 --> 5:02:18.160\n I got invited to give the commencement speech back at the I went to college\n\n5:02:18.160 --> 5:02:23.160\n for two semesters and dropped out and went on to do my tech stuff.\n\n5:02:23.160 --> 5:02:26.160\n But they still wanted me to come back and give a commencement speech.\n\n5:02:26.160 --> 5:02:29.160\n And I've got that pinned on my Twitter account.\n\n5:02:29.160 --> 5:02:32.160\n I still feel good about everything that I said there.\n\n5:02:32.160 --> 5:02:37.160\n And my biggest point was that the path for me might not be the path for\n\n5:02:37.160 --> 5:02:38.160\n everyone.\n\n5:02:38.160 --> 5:02:42.160\n And in fact, the advice, the path that I took and even the advice that I\n\n5:02:42.160 --> 5:02:47.160\n would give based on my experience and learnings probably isn't the best\n\n5:02:47.160 --> 5:02:48.160\n advice for everyone.\n\n5:02:48.160 --> 5:02:52.160\n Because what I did was all about this knowledge in depth.\n\n5:02:52.160 --> 5:02:56.160\n It was about not just having this surface level ability to make things do\n\n5:02:56.160 --> 5:02:59.160\n what I want, but to really understand them through and through.\n\n5:02:59.160 --> 5:03:04.160\n To let me do the systems engineering work and to sometimes find these\n\n5:03:04.160 --> 5:03:06.160\n inefficiencies that can be bypassed.\n\n5:03:06.160 --> 5:03:09.160\n And the whole world doesn't need that.\n\n5:03:09.160 --> 5:03:14.160\n Most programmers or engineers of any kind don't necessarily need to do that.\n\n5:03:14.160 --> 5:03:17.160\n They need to do a little job that's been parceled out to them.\n\n5:03:17.160 --> 5:03:18.160\n Be reliable.\n\n5:03:18.160 --> 5:03:20.160\n Let people depend on you.\n\n5:03:20.160 --> 5:03:22.160\n Do quality work with all of that.\n\n5:03:22.160 --> 5:03:28.160\n But people that do have an inclination for wanting to know things deeper and\n\n5:03:28.160 --> 5:03:34.160\n learn things deeper, there are just layers and layers of things out there.\n\n5:03:34.160 --> 5:03:36.160\n And it's amazing.\n\n5:03:36.160 --> 5:03:41.160\n If you're the right person that is excited about that, the world's never\n\n5:03:41.160 --> 5:03:42.160\n been like this before.\n\n5:03:42.160 --> 5:03:43.160\n It's better than ever.\n\n5:03:43.160 --> 5:03:47.160\n I mean, everything that was wonderful for me is still there, and there's\n\n5:03:47.160 --> 5:03:51.160\n whole new worlds to explore on the different things that you can do.\n\n5:03:51.160 --> 5:03:54.160\n And that, you know, it's hard work.\n\n5:03:54.160 --> 5:03:56.160\n Embrace the grind with it.\n\n5:03:56.160 --> 5:03:59.160\n And understand as much as you can.\n\n5:03:59.160 --> 5:04:03.160\n And then be prepared for opportunities to present themselves.\n\n5:04:03.160 --> 5:04:07.160\n Where you can't just say this is my goal in life and just push at that.\n\n5:04:07.160 --> 5:04:10.160\n I mean, you might be able to do that, but you're going to make more total\n\n5:04:10.160 --> 5:04:15.160\n progress if you say I'm preparing myself with this broad set of tools.\n\n5:04:15.160 --> 5:04:19.160\n And then I'm being aware of all the way things are changing as I move through\n\n5:04:19.160 --> 5:04:22.160\n the world and as the whole world changes around me.\n\n5:04:22.160 --> 5:04:26.160\n And then looking for opportunities to deploy the tools that you've built.\n\n5:04:26.160 --> 5:04:31.160\n And there's going to be more and more of those types of things there where an\n\n5:04:31.160 --> 5:04:35.160\n awareness of what's happening, where the inefficiencies are, what things can\n\n5:04:35.160 --> 5:04:38.160\n be done, what's possible versus what's current practice.\n\n5:04:38.160 --> 5:04:43.160\n And then finding those areas where you can go and make an adjustment and make\n\n5:04:43.160 --> 5:04:47.160\n something that may affect millions or billions of people in the world.\n\n5:04:47.160 --> 5:04:49.160\n Make it better.\n\n5:04:49.160 --> 5:04:53.160\n When, maybe from your own example, how were you able to recognize this about\n\n5:04:53.160 --> 5:04:58.160\n yourself that you saw the layers in a particular thing and you were drawn to\n\n5:04:58.160 --> 5:05:01.160\n discovering deeper and deeper truths about it?\n\n5:05:01.160 --> 5:05:05.160\n Is that something that was obvious to you that you couldn't help or is there some\n\n5:05:05.160 --> 5:05:08.160\n actions you had to take to actually allow yourself to dig deep?\n\n5:05:08.160 --> 5:05:12.160\n So in the earliest days of personal computers, I remember the reference\n\n5:05:12.160 --> 5:05:16.160\n manuals and the very early ones even had schematics of computers in the\n\n5:05:16.160 --> 5:05:21.160\n background, in the back of the books, as well as firmware listings and things.\n\n5:05:21.160 --> 5:05:23.160\n And I could look at that.\n\n5:05:23.160 --> 5:05:27.160\n And at that time, when I was a younger teenager, I didn't understand a lot of\n\n5:05:27.160 --> 5:05:30.160\n that stuff, how the different things worked.\n\n5:05:30.160 --> 5:05:34.160\n I was pulling out the information that I could get, but I always wanted to know\n\n5:05:34.160 --> 5:05:35.160\n all of that.\n\n5:05:35.160 --> 5:05:38.160\n There was kind of magical information sitting down there.\n\n5:05:38.160 --> 5:05:43.160\n It's like the elder lore that some gray beard wizard is the keeper of.\n\n5:05:43.160 --> 5:05:48.160\n And so I always felt that pull for wanting to know more, wanting to explore\n\n5:05:48.160 --> 5:05:51.160\n the mysterious areas there.\n\n5:05:51.160 --> 5:05:55.160\n And that followed right in through all the things that got the value,\n\n5:05:55.160 --> 5:06:00.160\n exploring the video cards leading to the scrolling advantages,\n\n5:06:00.160 --> 5:06:04.160\n exploring some of the academic papers and things, learning about BSP trees\n\n5:06:04.160 --> 5:06:10.160\n and the different things that I could do with those systems and just the huge\n\n5:06:10.160 --> 5:06:15.160\n larval phases going through aerospace, just reading bookshelves full of books.\n\n5:06:15.160 --> 5:06:18.160\n Again, that point where I have enough money, I can buy all the books I want.\n\n5:06:18.160 --> 5:06:23.160\n It was so valuable there where I was terrible with my money when I was a kid.\n\n5:06:23.160 --> 5:06:27.160\n My mom thought I would always be broke because I'd buy my comic books\n\n5:06:27.160 --> 5:06:28.160\n and just be out of money.\n\n5:06:28.160 --> 5:06:32.160\n But it was like all the pizza I want, all the Diet Coke I want,\n\n5:06:32.160 --> 5:06:34.160\n video games and then books.\n\n5:06:34.160 --> 5:06:36.160\n And it didn't take that much.\n\n5:06:36.160 --> 5:06:40.160\n As soon as I was making 27K a year, I felt rich and I was just getting\n\n5:06:40.160 --> 5:06:42.160\n all the things that I wanted.\n\n5:06:42.160 --> 5:06:46.160\n But that sense of books have always been magical to me.\n\n5:06:46.160 --> 5:06:50.160\n And that was one of the things that really made me smile is Andre had said\n\n5:06:50.160 --> 5:06:54.160\n when he came over to my house, he said he found my library inspiring.\n\n5:06:54.160 --> 5:06:55.160\n And it was great to see.\n\n5:06:55.160 --> 5:06:56.160\n I used to look at him.\n\n5:06:56.160 --> 5:06:57.160\n He's kind of a younger guy.\n\n5:06:57.160 --> 5:07:01.160\n I sometimes wonder if younger people these days have the same relationship\n\n5:07:01.160 --> 5:07:06.160\n with books that I do where they were such a cornerstone for me in so many ways.\n\n5:07:06.160 --> 5:07:08.160\n But that sense that, yeah, I always wanted to know it all.\n\n5:07:08.160 --> 5:07:09.160\n I know I can't.\n\n5:07:09.160 --> 5:07:11.160\n And that was like one of the last things I said.\n\n5:07:11.160 --> 5:07:14.160\n You can't know everything, but you should convince yourself\n\n5:07:14.160 --> 5:07:16.160\n that you can know anything.\n\n5:07:16.160 --> 5:07:20.160\n Any one particular thing, it was created and discovered by humans.\n\n5:07:20.160 --> 5:07:21.160\n You can learn it.\n\n5:07:21.160 --> 5:07:23.160\n You can find out what you need on there.\n\n5:07:23.160 --> 5:07:24.160\n And you can learn it deeply.\n\n5:07:24.160 --> 5:07:25.160\n Yeah.\n\n5:07:25.160 --> 5:07:29.160\n And you can drive a nail down through whatever layer cake problem space\n\n5:07:29.160 --> 5:07:32.160\n you've got and learn a cross section there.\n\n5:07:32.160 --> 5:07:34.160\n And not only can you have an impact doing that,\n\n5:07:34.160 --> 5:07:37.160\n you can attain happiness doing that.\n\n5:07:37.160 --> 5:07:41.160\n There's something so fulfilling about becoming a craftsman of a thing.\n\n5:07:41.160 --> 5:07:42.160\n Yeah.\n\n5:07:42.160 --> 5:07:45.160\n And I don't want to tell people that, look, this is a good career move.\n\n5:07:45.160 --> 5:07:48.160\n Just grit your teeth and bear it.\n\n5:07:48.160 --> 5:07:50.160\n You want people.\n\n5:07:50.160 --> 5:07:54.160\n And I do think it is possible sometimes to find the joy in something.\n\n5:07:54.160 --> 5:07:56.160\n Like it might not immediately appeal to you.\n\n5:07:56.160 --> 5:08:00.160\n But I had told people early on, like in software times,\n\n5:08:00.160 --> 5:08:04.160\n that a lot of game developers are in it just because they\n\n5:08:04.160 --> 5:08:06.160\n are so passionate about games.\n\n5:08:06.160 --> 5:08:10.160\n But I was always really more flexible in what appealed to me,\n\n5:08:10.160 --> 5:08:14.160\n where I said, I think I could be quite engaged doing\n\n5:08:14.160 --> 5:08:17.160\n operating system work or even database work.\n\n5:08:17.160 --> 5:08:19.160\n I would find the interest in that.\n\n5:08:19.160 --> 5:08:22.160\n Because I think most things that are significant in the world\n\n5:08:22.160 --> 5:08:25.160\n have a lot of layers and complexity to them\n\n5:08:25.160 --> 5:08:28.160\n and a lot of opportunities hidden within them.\n\n5:08:28.160 --> 5:08:31.160\n So that would probably be the most important thing to encourage to people\n\n5:08:31.160 --> 5:08:35.160\n is that you can weaponize curiosity.\n\n5:08:35.160 --> 5:08:38.160\n You can deploy your curiosity to find,\n\n5:08:38.160 --> 5:08:41.160\n to kind of like make things useful and valuable to you,\n\n5:08:41.160 --> 5:08:44.160\n even if they don't immediately appear that way.\n\n5:08:44.160 --> 5:08:45.160\n Deploy your curiosity.\n\n5:08:45.160 --> 5:08:47.160\n Yeah, that's very true.\n\n5:08:47.160 --> 5:08:49.160\n We've mentioned this debate point,\n\n5:08:49.160 --> 5:08:55.160\n whether mortality or fear of mortality is fundamental to creating an AGI.\n\n5:08:55.160 --> 5:08:58.160\n But let's talk about whether it's fundamental to human beings.\n\n5:08:58.160 --> 5:09:01.160\n Do you think about your own mortality?\n\n5:09:01.160 --> 5:09:03.160\n I really don't.\n\n5:09:03.160 --> 5:09:07.160\n And you probably always have to like take with a grain of salt\n\n5:09:07.160 --> 5:09:10.160\n anything somebody says about fundamental things like that.\n\n5:09:10.160 --> 5:09:16.160\n But I don't think about really aging, impending death,\n\n5:09:16.160 --> 5:09:20.160\n having a legacy with my children, things like that.\n\n5:09:20.160 --> 5:09:25.160\n And clearly it seems most of the world does a lot more than I do.\n\n5:09:25.160 --> 5:09:32.160\n So I mean I think I'm an outlier in that where it doesn't wind up\n\n5:09:32.160 --> 5:09:36.160\n being a real part of my thinking and motivation about things.\n\n5:09:36.160 --> 5:09:41.160\n So daily existence is about sort of the people you love\n\n5:09:41.160 --> 5:09:44.160\n and the problems before you.\n\n5:09:44.160 --> 5:09:47.160\n And I'm focused on what I'm working on right now.\n\n5:09:47.160 --> 5:09:49.160\n I do take that back.\n\n5:09:49.160 --> 5:09:54.160\n There's one aspect where the kind of finiteness of the life does impact me,\n\n5:09:54.160 --> 5:09:58.160\n and that is about thinking about the scope of the problems that I'm working on.\n\n5:09:58.160 --> 5:10:03.160\n When I decided to work on it, when I was like nuclear fission or AGI,\n\n5:10:03.160 --> 5:10:09.160\n these are big ticket things that impact large fractions of the world.\n\n5:10:09.160 --> 5:10:12.160\n And I was thinking to myself at some level that, okay,\n\n5:10:12.160 --> 5:10:17.160\n I may have a couple more swings at bat with me at full capability,\n\n5:10:17.160 --> 5:10:23.160\n but yes, my mental abilities will decay with age, mostly inevitably.\n\n5:10:23.160 --> 5:10:26.160\n I don't think it's a 0% chance that we will address some of that\n\n5:10:26.160 --> 5:10:28.160\n before it becomes a problem for me.\n\n5:10:28.160 --> 5:10:31.160\n I think exciting medical stuff in the next couple decades.\n\n5:10:31.160 --> 5:10:36.160\n But I do have this kind of vague plan that when I'm not at the top of my game\n\n5:10:36.160 --> 5:10:40.160\n and I don't feel that I'm in a position to put a dent in the world some way,\n\n5:10:40.160 --> 5:10:44.160\n that I'll probably wind up doing some kind of recreational retro programming\n\n5:10:44.160 --> 5:10:50.160\n or I'll work on something that I would not devote my life to now,\n\n5:10:50.160 --> 5:10:56.160\n but I can while away my time as the old man gardening in the code worlds.\n\n5:10:56.160 --> 5:11:01.160\n And then to step back even bigger, let me ask you about why we're here,\n\n5:11:01.160 --> 5:11:03.160\n we human beings.\n\n5:11:03.160 --> 5:11:05.160\n What's the meaning of it all?\n\n5:11:05.160 --> 5:11:07.160\n What's the meaning of life, John Carmack?\n\n5:11:07.160 --> 5:11:09.160\n So very similar with that last question.\n\n5:11:09.160 --> 5:11:12.160\n I know a lot of people fret about this question a lot,\n\n5:11:12.160 --> 5:11:14.160\n and I just really don't.\n\n5:11:14.160 --> 5:11:16.160\n I really don't give a damn.\n\n5:11:16.160 --> 5:11:21.160\n We are biological creatures that happenstance of evolution.\n\n5:11:21.160 --> 5:11:25.160\n We have innate drives that evolution crafted for survival\n\n5:11:25.160 --> 5:11:28.160\n and passing on of genetic codes.\n\n5:11:28.160 --> 5:11:34.160\n I don't find a lot of value in trying to go much deeper than that.\n\n5:11:34.160 --> 5:11:38.160\n I have my motivations, some of which are probably genetically coded\n\n5:11:38.160 --> 5:11:41.160\n and many of which are contingent on my upbringing\n\n5:11:41.160 --> 5:11:44.160\n and the path that I've had through my life.\n\n5:11:44.160 --> 5:11:48.160\n I don't run into like spades of depression or envy\n\n5:11:48.160 --> 5:11:52.160\n or anything that winds up being a challenge\n\n5:11:52.160 --> 5:11:55.160\n and forcing a degree of soul searching with things like that.\n\n5:11:55.160 --> 5:12:00.160\n I seem to be okay kind of without that.\n\n5:12:00.160 --> 5:12:04.160\n As a brilliant ant in the ant colony without looking up to the sky\n\n5:12:04.160 --> 5:12:07.160\n wondering why the hell am I here again.\n\n5:12:07.160 --> 5:12:15.160\n So the why of it, the incredible mystery of the fact that we started,\n\n5:12:15.160 --> 5:12:18.160\n first of all, the origin of life on Earth,\n\n5:12:18.160 --> 5:12:21.160\n and from that, from single cell organisms,\n\n5:12:21.160 --> 5:12:24.160\n the entirety of the evolutionary process took us somehow\n\n5:12:24.160 --> 5:12:29.160\n to this incredibly intelligent thing that is able to build Wolfenstein 3D\n\n5:12:29.160 --> 5:12:34.160\n and Doom and Quake and take a crack at the problem of AGI\n\n5:12:34.160 --> 5:12:37.160\n and things that eventually supersede human beings.\n\n5:12:37.160 --> 5:12:42.160\n That doesn't, the why of it is...\n\n5:12:42.160 --> 5:12:46.160\n It's been my experience that people that focus on,\n\n5:12:46.160 --> 5:12:49.160\n that don't focus on the here and now right in front of them\n\n5:12:49.160 --> 5:12:51.160\n tend to be less effective.\n\n5:12:51.160 --> 5:12:55.160\n I mean, it's not 100%, you know, vision matters to some people,\n\n5:12:55.160 --> 5:12:59.160\n but it doesn't seem to be a necessary motivator for me\n\n5:12:59.160 --> 5:13:03.160\n and I think that the process of getting there is usually done.\n\n5:13:03.160 --> 5:13:05.160\n It's like the magic of gradient descent.\n\n5:13:05.160 --> 5:13:08.160\n People just don't believe that just looking locally\n\n5:13:08.160 --> 5:13:11.160\n gets you to all of these spectacular things.\n\n5:13:11.160 --> 5:13:15.160\n That's been, you know, the decades of looking at\n\n5:13:15.160 --> 5:13:17.160\n really some of the smartest people in the world\n\n5:13:17.160 --> 5:13:20.160\n that would just push back forever against this idea\n\n5:13:20.160 --> 5:13:24.160\n that it's not this grand, sophisticated vision of everything,\n\n5:13:24.160 --> 5:13:27.160\n but little tiny steps, local information winds up\n\n5:13:27.160 --> 5:13:29.160\n leading to all the best answers.\n\n5:13:29.160 --> 5:13:34.160\n So the meaning of life is following locally\n\n5:13:34.160 --> 5:13:37.160\n wherever the gradient descent takes you.\n\n5:13:37.160 --> 5:13:39.160\n This was an incredible conversation,\n\n5:13:39.160 --> 5:13:43.160\n officially the longest conversation I've ever done on the podcast,\n\n5:13:43.160 --> 5:13:46.160\n which means a lot to me because I get to do it with one of my heroes.\n\n5:13:46.160 --> 5:13:48.160\n John, I can't tell you how much it means to me\n\n5:13:48.160 --> 5:13:50.160\n that you would sit down with me.\n\n5:13:50.160 --> 5:13:52.160\n You're an incredible human being.\n\n5:13:52.160 --> 5:13:55.160\n I can't wait what you do next, but you've already changed the world.\n\n5:13:55.160 --> 5:13:57.160\n You're an inspiration to so many people.\n\n5:13:57.160 --> 5:14:02.160\n And again, we haven't covered like most of what I was planning to talk about,\n\n5:14:02.160 --> 5:14:06.160\n so I hope we get a chance to talk someday in the future.\n\n5:14:06.160 --> 5:14:08.160\n I can't wait to see what you do next.\n\n5:14:08.160 --> 5:14:10.160\n Thank you so much again for talking to me.\n\n5:14:10.160 --> 5:14:11.160\n Thank you very much.\n\n5:14:11.160 --> 5:14:14.160\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Carmack.\n\n5:14:14.160 --> 5:14:18.160\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n5:14:18.160 --> 5:14:22.160\n And now, let me leave you with some words from John Carmack himself.\n\n5:14:22.160 --> 5:14:26.160\n Focused hard work is the real key to success.\n\n5:14:26.160 --> 5:14:28.160\n Keep your eyes on the goal,\n\n5:14:28.160 --> 5:14:31.160\n and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.\n\n5:14:31.160 --> 5:14:34.160\n If you aren't sure which way to do something,\n\n5:14:34.160 --> 5:14:37.160\n do it both ways and see which works better.\n\n5:14:37.160 --> 5:14:56.160\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
