founder of ucubed.org\n\n00:08.080 --> 00:10.080\n that seeks to inspire young minds\n\n00:10.080 --> 00:12.520\n with the beauty of mathematics.\n\n00:12.520 --> 00:14.040\n To support this podcast,\n\n00:14.040 --> 00:17.140\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n00:17.140 --> 00:19.340\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast\n\n00:19.340 --> 00:22.420\n and here is my conversation with Jo Bowler.\n\n00:23.640 --> 00:27.200\n What to you is beautiful about mathematics?\n\n00:27.200 --> 00:30.400\n I love a mathematics that some people\n\n00:30.400 --> 00:32.720\n don't even think of as mathematics,\n\n00:32.720 --> 00:37.640\n which is beautiful, creative mathematics,\n\n00:37.640 --> 00:39.520\n where we look at maths in different ways,\n\n00:39.520 --> 00:41.240\n we visualize it,\n\n00:41.240 --> 00:44.680\n we think about different solutions to problems.\n\n00:44.680 --> 00:46.120\n A lot of people think of maths\n\n00:46.120 --> 00:49.560\n as you have one method and one answer.\n\n00:49.560 --> 00:51.160\n And what I love about maths\n\n00:51.160 --> 00:54.000\n is the multiple different ways you can see things,\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:56.760\n different methods, different ways of seeing different.\n\n00:56.760 --> 00:59.160\n In some cases, different solutions.\n\n00:59.160 --> 01:02.140\n So that is what is beautiful to me about mathematics,\n\n01:02.140 --> 01:05.800\n that you can see and solve it in many different ways.\n\n01:05.800 --> 01:10.000\n And also the sad part that many people think\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:13.820\n that maths is just one answer and one method.\n\n01:13.820 --> 01:16.340\n So to you, the beauty emerges\n\n01:16.340 --> 01:18.560\n when you have a problem with a solution\n\n01:18.560 --> 01:21.080\n and you start adding other solutions,\n\n01:21.080 --> 01:25.440\n simpler solutions, weirder solutions, more interesting,\n\n01:25.440 --> 01:28.180\n some of their visual, some of their algebraic,\n\n01:28.180 --> 01:30.080\n geometry, all that kind of stuff.\n\n01:30.080 --> 01:32.280\n Yeah, I mean, I always say\n\n01:32.280 --> 01:35.360\n that you can take any maths area and make it visual.\n\n01:35.360 --> 01:36.400\n And we say to teachers,\n\n01:36.400 --> 01:39.880\n give us your most dry, boring maths\n\n01:39.880 --> 01:43.200\n and we'll make it a visual, interesting, creative problem.\n\n01:43.200 --> 01:46.900\n And it turns out you can do that with any area of maths.\n\n01:46.900 --> 01:49.600\n And I think we've given,\n\n01:49.600 --> 01:51.680\n it's been a great disservice to kids and others\n\n01:51.680 --> 01:56.120\n that it's always been numbers, lots and lots of numbers.\n\n01:56.120 --> 01:57.040\n Numbers can be great,\n\n01:57.040 --> 02:01.000\n but you can think about maths in other ways besides numbers.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:05.040\n Do you find that most people are better visual learners\n\n02:05.040 --> 02:07.520\n or is this just something that's complimentary?\n\n02:08.360 --> 02:11.000\n What's the kind of the full spectrum of students\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.360\n in the way they like to explore maths, would you say?\n\n02:13.360 --> 02:17.440\n There's definitely people who come into the classes I do\n\n02:17.440 --> 02:19.720\n who are more interested in visual thinking\n\n02:19.720 --> 02:21.920\n and like visual approaches.\n\n02:21.920 --> 02:24.640\n But it turns out what the neuroscience is telling us\n\n02:24.640 --> 02:26.680\n is that when we think about maths,\n\n02:26.680 --> 02:29.120\n there are two visual pathways in the brain\n\n02:29.120 --> 02:32.720\n and we should all be thinking about it visually.\n\n02:32.720 --> 02:34.400\n Some approaches have been to say,\n\n02:34.400 --> 02:37.360\n well, you're a visual learner, so we'll give you visuals\n\n02:37.360 --> 02:40.580\n and you're not a visual learner.\n\n02:40.580 --> 02:45.080\n But actually, if you think you're not a visual learner,\n\n02:45.080 --> 02:48.840\n it's probably more important that you have a visual approach.\n\n02:48.840 --> 02:51.560\n So you can develop that part of your brain.\n\n02:51.560 --> 02:52.920\n So you were saying that there's some kind\n\n02:52.920 --> 02:54.520\n of interconnected aspect to it.\n\n02:54.520 --> 02:56.680\n So the visual connects with the non visual.\n\n02:56.680 --> 02:59.840\n Yeah, so this is what the neuroscience has shown us\n\n02:59.840 --> 03:01.160\n that when you work on a maths problem,\n\n03:01.160 --> 03:03.480\n there are five different brain pathways\n\n03:03.480 --> 03:06.720\n and that the most high achieving people in the world\n\n03:06.720 --> 03:10.440\n are people who have more connections between these pathways.\n\n03:10.440 --> 03:13.840\n So if you see a maths problem with numbers,\n\n03:13.840 --> 03:15.880\n but you also see it visually,\n\n03:15.880 --> 03:17.980\n that will cause a connection to happen in your brain\n\n03:17.980 --> 03:19.840\n between these pathways.\n\n03:19.840 --> 03:22.080\n And if you maybe write about it with words,\n\n03:22.080 --> 03:23.380\n that would cause another connection\n\n03:23.380 --> 03:26.460\n or maybe you build it with something physical\n\n03:26.460 --> 03:28.360\n that would cause a different connection.\n\n03:28.360 --> 03:31.480\n And what we want for kids is we call it\n\n03:31.480 --> 03:33.640\n a multi dimensional experience of maths,\n\n03:33.640 --> 03:35.480\n seeing it in different ways,\n\n03:35.480 --> 03:37.860\n experiencing it in different ways,\n\n03:37.860 --> 03:40.600\n that will cause that great connected brain.\n\n03:40.600 --> 03:43.300\n You know, there's these stories of physicists doing the same.\n\n03:43.300 --> 03:45.000\n I find physicists are often better\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.160\n at building that part of their brain\n\n03:47.160 --> 03:50.600\n of using visualization for intuition building,\n\n03:50.600 --> 03:53.020\n because you ultimately want to understand\n\n03:53.920 --> 03:57.040\n the like the deepest secret underneath this problem.\n\n03:57.040 --> 03:59.760\n And for that, you have to intuit your way there.\n\n03:59.760 --> 04:02.720\n And you mentioned offline that one of the ways\n\n04:02.720 --> 04:03.680\n you might approach a problem\n\n04:03.680 --> 04:05.840\n is to try to tell a story about it.\n\n04:05.840 --> 04:07.760\n And some of it is like legend,\n\n04:07.760 --> 04:10.880\n but I'm sure it's not always is, you know,\n\n04:10.880 --> 04:14.880\n you have Einstein thinking about a train,\n\n04:14.880 --> 04:16.680\n you know, and the speed of light\n\n04:16.680 --> 04:20.000\n and you know, that kind of intuition is useful.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:22.960\n You start to like imagine a physical world,\n\n04:22.960 --> 04:25.480\n like how does this idea manifest itself\n\n04:25.480 --> 04:26.320\n in the physical world?\n\n04:26.320 --> 04:27.560\n And then start playing in your mind\n\n04:27.560 --> 04:29.240\n with that physical world and think,\n\n04:29.240 --> 04:30.200\n is this going to be true?\n\n04:30.200 --> 04:31.480\n Is this going to be true?\n\n04:31.480 --> 04:32.320\n Right.\n\n04:32.320 --> 04:35.800\n Einstein is well known for thinking visually.\n\n04:35.800 --> 04:39.480\n And people talk about how he really didn't want\n\n04:39.480 --> 04:41.520\n to go anywhere with problems\n\n04:41.520 --> 04:43.240\n without thinking about them visually.\n\n04:43.240 --> 04:44.780\n But the other thing you mentioned\n\n04:44.780 --> 04:48.760\n that sparked something for me is thinking with intuition,\n\n04:48.760 --> 04:51.400\n like having intuition about math problems.\n\n04:51.400 --> 04:54.080\n That's another thing that's often absent in math class,\n\n04:54.080 --> 04:55.800\n the idea that you might think about a problem\n\n04:55.800 --> 05:00.760\n and use your intuition, but so important.\n\n05:00.760 --> 05:02.820\n And when mathematicians are interviewed,\n\n05:02.820 --> 05:04.400\n they will very frequently talk about the role\n\n05:04.400 --> 05:07.200\n of intuition in solving problems,\n\n05:07.200 --> 05:12.200\n but not commonly acknowledged or brought into education.\n\n05:12.200 --> 05:14.200\n Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.\n\n05:14.200 --> 05:18.960\n Like if you task yourself with building an intuition\n\n05:18.960 --> 05:23.280\n about a problem, that's where you start to pull in,\n\n05:23.280 --> 05:26.680\n like what is the pattern I'm seeing?\n\n05:26.680 --> 05:28.080\n In order to understand the pattern,\n\n05:28.080 --> 05:31.240\n you might want to then start utilizing visualization.\n\n05:31.240 --> 05:33.600\n But ultimately, that's all in service\n\n05:33.600 --> 05:38.280\n of like solving the puzzle, like cracking it open\n\n05:38.280 --> 05:42.160\n to get the simple explanation of why things are wrong.\n\n05:42.160 --> 05:43.680\n Why things are the way they are,\n\n05:43.680 --> 05:47.560\n as opposed to, like you said, having a particular algorithm\n\n05:47.560 --> 05:50.080\n that you can then execute to solve the problem.\n\n05:50.080 --> 05:51.080\n Yeah, but it's hard.\n\n05:51.080 --> 05:53.480\n It's hard, like reasoning is really hard.\n\n05:53.480 --> 05:55.080\n Yeah, it's hard.\n\n05:55.080 --> 05:58.780\n I mean, I love to value what's hard in maths\n\n05:58.780 --> 06:00.560\n instead of being afraid of it.\n\n06:00.560 --> 06:02.440\n We know that when you struggle,\n\n06:02.440 --> 06:04.480\n that's actually a really good time for your brain.\n\n06:04.480 --> 06:07.200\n You want to be struggling when you're thinking about things.\n\n06:07.200 --> 06:10.000\n So if it's hard to think intuitively about something,\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:13.560\n that's probably a really good time for your brain.\n\n06:13.560 --> 06:16.680\n I used to work with somebody called Sebastian Thrun,\n\n06:16.680 --> 06:19.520\n who is a great sort of mathematician,\n\n06:19.520 --> 06:21.200\n you might think of him, AI person.\n\n06:21.200 --> 06:23.720\n And I remember in one interview I did with him,\n\n06:23.720 --> 06:25.760\n he talked about how they'd built robots,\n\n06:25.760 --> 06:27.560\n I think for the Smithsonian,\n\n06:27.560 --> 06:29.320\n and how they were having this trouble\n\n06:29.320 --> 06:32.300\n with them picking up white noise.\n\n06:32.300 --> 06:34.540\n And he said they had to solve it.\n\n06:34.540 --> 06:36.400\n They had to work out what's going on\n\n06:36.400 --> 06:41.280\n and how he intuitively worked out what the problem was.\n\n06:41.280 --> 06:45.560\n But then it took him three weeks to show it mathematically.\n\n06:45.560 --> 06:47.000\n I thought that was really interesting\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.600\n that how you can have this intuition\n\n06:49.600 --> 06:51.760\n and know something works.\n\n06:51.760 --> 06:53.380\n It's kind of different from going through\n\n06:53.380 --> 06:56.980\n that long mathematical process of proving it,\n\n06:56.980 --> 06:58.240\n but so important.\n\n06:58.240 --> 07:01.600\n Yeah, I think probably our brains are evolved\n\n07:01.600 --> 07:03.920\n as like intuition machines\n\n07:03.920 --> 07:08.920\n and the math of like showing it like formally\n\n07:08.920 --> 07:12.120\n is probably an extra thing that we're not designed for.\n\n07:12.120 --> 07:14.960\n You see that with Feynman and his,\n\n07:14.960 --> 07:16.960\n I mean, it just, all of these physicists,\n\n07:16.960 --> 07:21.140\n definitely you see starting with intuition,\n\n07:21.140 --> 07:23.400\n sometimes starting with an experiment\n\n07:24.520 --> 07:27.920\n and then the experiment inspires intuition.\n\n07:27.920 --> 07:29.320\n But you can think of an experiment\n\n07:29.320 --> 07:31.080\n as a kind of visualization.\n\n07:31.080 --> 07:34.320\n Just like let's take whatever the heck we're looking at\n\n07:34.320 --> 07:38.680\n and draw it and draw like the pattern as it evolves,\n\n07:38.680 --> 07:41.120\n as the thing grows for N equals one,\n\n07:41.120 --> 07:42.880\n for N equals two, N equals three,\n\n07:42.880 --> 07:44.800\n you start to play with it.\n\n07:44.800 --> 07:49.440\n And then in the modern day, which I loved doing is,\n\n07:49.440 --> 07:52.480\n you can write a program that then visualizes it for you.\n\n07:52.480 --> 07:55.520\n And then you can start exploring it programmatically.\n\n07:55.520 --> 08:00.160\n And then you can do so interactively too.\n\n08:00.160 --> 08:03.600\n I tend to not like interactive\n\n08:03.600 --> 08:05.680\n because it takes way too much work\n\n08:05.680 --> 08:07.160\n because you have to click and move and stuff.\n\n08:07.160 --> 08:09.880\n I love to interact through writing programs,\n\n08:09.880 --> 08:12.480\n but that's my particular brain, software engineer.\n\n08:12.480 --> 08:16.960\n So like you can do all these kinds of visualizations\n\n08:16.960 --> 08:19.320\n and then there's the tools of visualization,\n\n08:19.320 --> 08:22.640\n like color, all of those kinds of things\n\n08:22.640 --> 08:24.240\n that you're absolutely right.\n\n08:24.240 --> 08:27.200\n They're actually not taught very much.\n\n08:27.200 --> 08:28.800\n Like the art of visualization.\n\n08:28.800 --> 08:30.040\n Not taught.\n\n08:30.040 --> 08:33.720\n And we love as well color coding.\n\n08:33.720 --> 08:36.480\n Like when you represent something mathematically,\n\n08:36.480 --> 08:41.040\n you can show color to show the growth and kind of code that.\n\n08:41.040 --> 08:44.280\n So if I have an algebraic expression for a pattern,\n\n08:44.280 --> 08:46.720\n maybe I show the X with a certain color,\n\n08:46.720 --> 08:48.000\n but also write in that color\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.360\n so you can see the relationship.\n\n08:51.360 --> 08:52.320\n Very cool.\n\n08:52.320 --> 08:54.920\n And yeah, particularly in our work\n\n08:54.920 --> 08:56.800\n with elementary teachers,\n\n08:56.800 --> 08:58.720\n many of them come to our workshops\n\n08:58.720 --> 09:00.720\n and they're literally in tears\n\n09:00.720 --> 09:03.840\n when they see things making sense visually\n\n09:03.840 --> 09:06.280\n because they've spent their whole lives\n\n09:06.280 --> 09:09.200\n not realizing you can really understand things\n\n09:09.200 --> 09:10.920\n with these visuals.\n\n09:10.920 --> 09:12.680\n It's quite powerful.\n\n09:12.680 --> 09:17.680\n You say that there's something valuable to learning\n\n09:17.800 --> 09:20.480\n when the thing that you're doing is challenging,\n\n09:20.480 --> 09:21.600\n is difficult.\n\n09:21.600 --> 09:24.000\n So a lot of people say math is hard\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.040\n or math is too hard or too hard for me.\n\n09:28.040 --> 09:32.360\n Do you think math should be easy or should it be hard?\n\n09:33.440 --> 09:36.920\n I think it's great when things are challenging,\n\n09:36.920 --> 09:39.160\n but there's something that's really key\n\n09:39.160 --> 09:42.880\n to being able to deal with challenging maths\n\n09:42.880 --> 09:46.800\n and that is knowing that you can do it.\n\n09:46.800 --> 09:48.680\n And I think the problem in education\n\n09:48.680 --> 09:51.200\n is a lot of people have got this idea\n\n09:51.200 --> 09:54.000\n that you're either born with a maths brain or you're not.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.720\n So when they start to struggle,\n\n09:55.720 --> 09:58.440\n they think, oh, I don't have that maths brain.\n\n09:58.440 --> 10:00.960\n And then they will literally sort of switch off\n\n10:00.960 --> 10:04.080\n in their brain and things will go downhill from that point.\n\n10:04.080 --> 10:06.240\n So struggle becomes a lot easier\n\n10:06.240 --> 10:10.960\n and you're able to struggle if you don't have that idea,\n\n10:10.960 --> 10:13.400\n but you know that you can do it.\n\n10:13.400 --> 10:16.000\n You have to go through this struggle to get there,\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.720\n but you're able to do that.\n\n10:18.720 --> 10:21.760\n And so we're hampered in being able to struggle\n\n10:21.760 --> 10:25.240\n with these ideas we've been given about what we can do.\n\n10:25.240 --> 10:26.920\n Can I ask a difficult question here?\n\n10:26.920 --> 10:27.760\n Yeah.\n\n10:27.760 --> 10:31.960\n So there's kind of, I don't know what the right term is,\n\n10:31.960 --> 10:36.960\n but some people struggle with learning in different ways,\n\n10:38.640 --> 10:42.400\n like their brain is constructed in different ways.\n\n10:42.400 --> 10:47.000\n And how much should, as educators,\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.280\n should we make room for that?\n\n10:49.280 --> 10:52.360\n So how do you know the difference between this is hard\n\n10:52.360 --> 10:54.440\n and I don't like doing hard things\n\n10:54.440 --> 10:57.040\n versus my brain is wired in a way\n\n10:57.040 --> 10:59.040\n where I need to learn in very different ways.\n\n10:59.040 --> 11:00.640\n I can't learn it this way.\n\n11:00.640 --> 11:02.320\n How do you find that line?\n\n11:02.320 --> 11:04.040\n How do you operate in that gray area?\n\n11:04.040 --> 11:07.360\n So this is why being a teacher is so hard\n\n11:07.360 --> 11:09.360\n and people really don't appreciate\n\n11:09.360 --> 11:12.280\n how difficult teaching is when you're faced with,\n\n11:12.280 --> 11:14.920\n I don't know, 30 students who think in different ways.\n\n11:14.920 --> 11:19.480\n So, but this is also why I believe it's so important\n\n11:19.480 --> 11:21.960\n to have this multi dimensional approach to maths.\n\n11:21.960 --> 11:24.680\n We've really offered it in one way,\n\n11:24.680 --> 11:27.360\n which is here's some numbers in a method.\n\n11:27.360 --> 11:31.200\n You follow me, do what I just did and then reproduce it.\n\n11:31.200 --> 11:33.840\n And so there are some kids who like doing that\n\n11:33.840 --> 11:34.880\n and they do well.\n\n11:34.880 --> 11:37.680\n And a lot of kids who don't like doing it\n\n11:37.680 --> 11:39.120\n and don't do well.\n\n11:39.120 --> 11:42.760\n But when you open up maths and you give,\n\n11:42.760 --> 11:44.640\n you let kids experience it in different ways,\n\n11:44.640 --> 11:47.640\n maybe visually with numbers, with words.\n\n11:47.640 --> 11:49.960\n What happens is kids,\n\n11:49.960 --> 11:52.440\n there are many more kids who can access it.\n\n11:52.440 --> 11:56.160\n So those different brain wirings you're talking about,\n\n11:56.160 --> 11:58.840\n where some people are just more able to do something\n\n11:58.840 --> 12:00.240\n in a particular way.\n\n12:00.240 --> 12:01.840\n That's why we want to,\n\n12:01.840 --> 12:04.680\n that's one of the reasons we want to open it up\n\n12:04.680 --> 12:08.360\n so that there are different ways of accessing it.\n\n12:08.360 --> 12:11.160\n And then that's not really a problem.\n\n12:11.160 --> 12:15.960\n So I grew up in the Soviet Union and fell in love\n\n12:15.960 --> 12:17.400\n with math early.\n\n12:17.400 --> 12:19.800\n I was forced into math early\n\n12:19.800 --> 12:22.320\n and fell in love through force.\n\n12:22.320 --> 12:23.160\n That's good.\n\n12:23.160 --> 12:25.400\n Well, good that you fell in love about the force.\n\n12:25.400 --> 12:28.360\n Well, but something we talked about a little bit\n\n12:28.360 --> 12:33.320\n is there is such a value for excellence.\n\n12:33.320 --> 12:37.920\n It's competitive and it's also everybody kind of looks up\n\n12:37.920 --> 12:42.920\n the definition of success is being in a particular class\n\n12:44.440 --> 12:46.320\n is being really good at it.\n\n12:47.640 --> 12:49.680\n And like, it's not improving.\n\n12:49.680 --> 12:50.920\n It's like being really good.\n\n12:50.920 --> 12:53.800\n I mean, we are much more like that with sports, for example.\n\n12:53.800 --> 12:56.880\n We're not, it's like, it's understood,\n\n12:56.880 --> 12:59.760\n you're going to star on the basketball team\n\n12:59.760 --> 13:02.400\n if you're gonna start on the basketball team\n\n13:02.400 --> 13:05.120\n if you're going to be better than the other guys,\n\n13:05.120 --> 13:06.520\n the other girls on the team.\n\n13:06.520 --> 13:11.520\n So that coupled with the belief,\n\n13:12.160 --> 13:14.640\n this could be partially a communist belief, I don't know,\n\n13:14.640 --> 13:19.120\n but the belief that everybody is capable of being great.\n\n13:19.120 --> 13:22.160\n But if you're not great, that's your fault\n\n13:22.160 --> 13:23.400\n and you need to work harder.\n\n13:23.400 --> 13:27.880\n And I remember I had a sense that probably delusional,\n\n13:27.880 --> 13:29.600\n but I could win a Nobel prize.\n\n13:29.600 --> 13:31.360\n I don't even know what that entails.\n\n13:31.360 --> 13:36.360\n But I thought, like my dad early on told me just offhand\n\n13:39.560 --> 13:42.520\n and it always stuck with me that if you can figure out\n\n13:42.520 --> 13:46.120\n how to build a time machine, how to travel back in time,\n\n13:46.120 --> 13:48.360\n it will probably give you a Nobel prize.\n\n13:48.360 --> 13:50.400\n And I remember early in my life thinking\n\n13:50.400 --> 13:52.440\n I'm going to invent the time machine.\n\n13:52.440 --> 13:56.720\n And like the tools of mathematics were in service\n\n13:56.720 --> 14:00.000\n of that dream of winning the Nobel prize.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:03.480\n It's silly. I didn't really think in those concrete terms,\n\n14:03.480 --> 14:06.760\n but I just thought I could be great at feeling.\n\n14:06.760 --> 14:08.640\n And then when you struggle,\n\n14:08.640 --> 14:11.920\n the belief that you could be great is like,\n\n14:11.920 --> 14:12.960\n struggle is good.\n\n14:12.960 --> 14:14.520\n Right, pushes you on, yeah.\n\n14:14.520 --> 14:17.240\n And so the other thing about the Soviet system\n\n14:17.240 --> 14:20.520\n that I'd love to hear your comments about\n\n14:20.520 --> 14:23.840\n is just the sheer like hours of math.\n\n14:23.840 --> 14:25.600\n Like the number of courses,\n\n14:25.600 --> 14:29.280\n you're talking about a lot of geometry, a lot more geometry.\n\n14:29.280 --> 14:30.640\n I think in the American system,\n\n14:30.640 --> 14:33.080\n you take maybe one year of geometry.\n\n14:33.080 --> 14:33.920\n In high school, yeah.\n\n14:33.920 --> 14:35.240\n In high school.\n\n14:35.240 --> 14:37.480\n First of all, geometry is beautiful, it's visual.\n\n14:37.480 --> 14:39.120\n And then you get to reason through proofs\n\n14:39.120 --> 14:40.160\n and stuff like that.\n\n14:40.160 --> 14:42.600\n In Russia, I remember just being nailed\n\n14:42.600 --> 14:43.840\n over and over with geometry.\n\n14:43.840 --> 14:45.600\n It was just nonstop.\n\n14:45.600 --> 14:48.160\n And then of course there's different perspectives\n\n14:48.160 --> 14:50.320\n on calculus and just the whole,\n\n14:50.320 --> 14:55.320\n the sense was that math is like fundamental\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.600\n to the development of the human mind.\n\n14:58.600 --> 15:02.400\n So math, but also science and literature, by the way,\n\n15:02.400 --> 15:04.600\n was also hit very hard.\n\n15:04.600 --> 15:08.200\n Like we read a lot of serious adult stuff.\n\n15:08.200 --> 15:09.920\n America does that a little bit too.\n\n15:09.920 --> 15:12.600\n They challenge young adults with good literature,\n\n15:12.600 --> 15:16.160\n but they don't challenge adults very much with math.\n\n15:16.160 --> 15:20.840\n So those two things, valuing excellence\n\n15:20.840 --> 15:23.680\n and just a lot of math in the curriculum.\n\n15:23.680 --> 15:26.880\n Do you think, do you find that interesting?\n\n15:26.880 --> 15:28.680\n Because it seems to have been successful.\n\n15:28.680 --> 15:30.160\n Yeah, I think that's very interesting.\n\n15:30.160 --> 15:32.680\n And there is a lot of success,\n\n15:32.680 --> 15:34.080\n people coming through the Soviet system.\n\n15:34.080 --> 15:37.320\n I think something that's very different to the US\n\n15:37.320 --> 15:39.440\n and other countries in the world\n\n15:39.440 --> 15:41.920\n is that idea that excellence is important\n\n15:41.920 --> 15:44.080\n and you can get there if you work hard.\n\n15:44.920 --> 15:48.680\n In the US, there's an idea that excellence is important,\n\n15:48.680 --> 15:52.120\n but then kids are given the idea in many ways\n\n15:52.120 --> 15:53.720\n that you can either do it\n\n15:53.720 --> 15:56.120\n or you're one of the people who can't.\n\n15:56.120 --> 15:58.440\n So many students in the school system\n\n15:58.440 --> 15:59.680\n think they're one of the kids who can't.\n\n15:59.680 --> 16:02.280\n So there's no point in trying hard\n\n16:02.280 --> 16:04.680\n because you're never going to get there.\n\n16:04.680 --> 16:09.600\n So if you can switch that idea, it would be huge.\n\n16:09.600 --> 16:11.120\n And it seems from what you've said\n\n16:11.120 --> 16:16.120\n that in the Soviet Union, that idea is really different.\n\n16:16.280 --> 16:19.560\n Now, the downside of that idea that anybody can get there\n\n16:19.560 --> 16:24.000\n if you work hard is that thought\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.480\n that if you're not getting there, it's your fault.\n\n16:26.480 --> 16:28.680\n And I would add something into that.\n\n16:28.680 --> 16:30.680\n I would say that anybody can get there,\n\n16:31.800 --> 16:35.120\n but they need to work hard and they also need good teaching\n\n16:35.120 --> 16:37.960\n because there are some people who really can't get there\n\n16:37.960 --> 16:41.240\n because they're not given access to that good teaching.\n\n16:41.240 --> 16:44.600\n So, but that would be huge, that change.\n\n16:44.600 --> 16:46.480\n As to doing lots of maths,\n\n16:46.480 --> 16:50.960\n if maths was interesting and open and creative\n\n16:50.960 --> 16:53.760\n and multi dimensional, I would be all for it.\n\n16:53.760 --> 16:56.040\n We actually run summer camps at Stanford\n\n16:56.040 --> 16:59.080\n where we invite kids in and we give them this maths\n\n16:59.080 --> 17:00.680\n that I love.\n\n17:00.680 --> 17:05.320\n And in our camp classrooms, they were three hours long.\n\n17:05.320 --> 17:09.440\n And when we were planning, the teachers were like three hours,\n\n17:09.440 --> 17:11.480\n are we going to be able to keep the kids excited\n\n17:11.480 --> 17:12.480\n for three hours?\n\n17:12.480 --> 17:15.960\n Turned out they didn't want to go to break or lunch.\n\n17:15.960 --> 17:19.440\n They'd be so into these mathematical patterns.\n\n17:19.440 --> 17:21.080\n We couldn't stop them.\n\n17:21.080 --> 17:22.800\n It was amazing.\n\n17:22.800 --> 17:25.160\n So yeah, if maths was more like that,\n\n17:25.160 --> 17:29.040\n then I think having more of it would be a really good thing.\n\n17:29.040 --> 17:30.960\n So what age are you talking about?\n\n17:30.960 --> 17:35.480\n Is there, could you comment on what age is like\n\n17:35.480 --> 17:39.120\n the most important when people quit math\n\n17:39.120 --> 17:42.760\n or give up on themselves or on math in general?\n\n17:42.760 --> 17:45.520\n And perhaps that age or something earlier\n\n17:45.520 --> 17:48.560\n is really an important moment for them to discover,\n\n17:48.560 --> 17:51.440\n to be inspired to discover the magic of math.\n\n17:51.440 --> 17:54.400\n I think a lot of kids start to give up on themselves\n\n17:54.400 --> 17:59.200\n and maths around from about fifth grade.\n\n17:59.200 --> 18:02.360\n And then those middle school years are really important.\n\n18:02.360 --> 18:04.520\n And fifth grade can be pivotal for kids\n\n18:04.520 --> 18:07.920\n just because they're allowed to explore\n\n18:07.920 --> 18:10.560\n and think in good ways\n\n18:10.560 --> 18:12.240\n in the early grades of elementary school.\n\n18:12.240 --> 18:13.520\n But fifth grade teachers are often like,\n\n18:13.520 --> 18:15.440\n okay, we're going to prepare you now for middle school\n\n18:15.440 --> 18:18.160\n and we're going to give you grades and lots of tests.\n\n18:18.160 --> 18:21.720\n And that's when kids start to feel really badly\n\n18:21.720 --> 18:22.560\n about themselves.\n\n18:22.560 --> 18:24.760\n And so middle school years,\n\n18:24.760 --> 18:27.000\n our camps are middle school students.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.160\n We think of those years as really pivotal.\n\n18:29.160 --> 18:31.640\n Many kids in those years are deciding,\n\n18:31.640 --> 18:35.640\n yes, I'm going to keep going with STEM subjects\n\n18:35.640 --> 18:38.280\n or no, I'm not, that this isn't for me.\n\n18:38.280 --> 18:40.760\n So, I mean, all years are important\n\n18:40.760 --> 18:43.080\n and in all years you can kind of switch kids\n\n18:43.080 --> 18:45.600\n and get them on a different pathway.\n\n18:45.600 --> 18:48.400\n But I think those middle school years are really important.\n\n18:48.400 --> 18:50.800\n So what's the role of the teacher in this?\n\n18:50.800 --> 18:53.040\n So one is the explanation of the subject,\n\n18:53.040 --> 18:58.040\n but do you think teachers should almost do like one on one,\n\n18:58.320 --> 19:01.760\n you know, little Johnny, I believe in you kind of thing?\n\n19:01.760 --> 19:03.800\n Like that energy of like.\n\n19:03.800 --> 19:05.320\n Turns out it's really important.\n\n19:05.320 --> 19:07.440\n There's a study that was done,\n\n19:07.440 --> 19:10.360\n it was actually done in high school English classrooms\n\n19:10.360 --> 19:14.040\n where all kids wrote an essay for their teacher.\n\n19:14.040 --> 19:16.000\n And this was done as an experiment.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.840\n Half of the kids got feedback from their teacher,\n\n19:18.840 --> 19:21.040\n diagnostic feedback, which is great.\n\n19:21.040 --> 19:22.000\n But for half of the kids,\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:23.920\n it said an extra sentence at the bottom\n\n19:23.920 --> 19:26.240\n that the researchers had put on.\n\n19:26.240 --> 19:30.000\n And the kids who read that extra sentence\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:33.480\n did significantly better in English a whole year later.\n\n19:33.480 --> 19:36.720\n The only change was this one sentence.\n\n19:36.720 --> 19:37.640\n What did the sentence say?\n\n19:37.640 --> 19:39.720\n So what did the sentence say?\n\n19:39.720 --> 19:42.880\n The sentence said, I'm giving you this feedback\n\n19:42.880 --> 19:44.080\n because I believe in you.\n\n19:45.200 --> 19:48.640\n And the kids who read that did better a year later.\n\n19:48.640 --> 19:49.480\n Yeah.\n\n19:49.480 --> 19:52.320\n So when I share this with teachers,\n\n19:52.320 --> 19:53.840\n I say, you know, I'm not suggesting\n\n19:53.840 --> 19:56.000\n you put on the bottom of all kids work.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.400\n I'm giving this feedback because I believe in you.\n\n19:58.400 --> 20:00.720\n One of the teachers said to me, we don't put it on a stamp.\n\n20:00.720 --> 20:03.560\n I said, no, don't put it on a stamp.\n\n20:03.560 --> 20:07.960\n It's, but your words are really important.\n\n20:07.960 --> 20:12.480\n And kids are sitting in classrooms all the time thinking,\n\n20:12.480 --> 20:13.880\n what does my teacher think of me?\n\n20:13.880 --> 20:15.680\n Does my teacher think I can do this?\n\n20:17.240 --> 20:19.520\n So it turns out it is really important\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:22.560\n to be saying to kids, I know you can do this.\n\n20:22.560 --> 20:27.560\n And those messages are not given enough by teachers.\n\n20:27.600 --> 20:28.960\n And really believe it.\n\n20:28.960 --> 20:29.800\n And believe it.\n\n20:29.800 --> 20:30.640\n Yeah, it's like.\n\n20:30.640 --> 20:32.440\n You can't just say it, you have to believe it.\n\n20:32.440 --> 20:34.360\n I sometimes, cause it's like,\n\n20:36.520 --> 20:38.000\n it's such a funny dance,\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.560\n cause I'm almost such a perfectionist.\n\n20:39.560 --> 20:41.320\n I'm extremely self critical.\n\n20:41.320 --> 20:43.600\n And I have one of the students come up to me\n\n20:43.600 --> 20:48.600\n and it's clear to me that they're not even close to good.\n\n20:49.360 --> 20:52.280\n And it's tempting for me to be like,\n\n20:52.280 --> 20:54.320\n to sort of give up on them mentally.\n\n20:54.320 --> 20:55.840\n But the reality is like,\n\n20:55.840 --> 20:58.920\n if you look at many great people throughout history,\n\n20:58.920 --> 21:00.360\n they sucked at some point.\n\n21:00.360 --> 21:01.200\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n21:01.200 --> 21:04.200\n And some of the greatest took nonlinear paths\n\n21:04.200 --> 21:08.760\n to where they sucked for long into later life.\n\n21:08.760 --> 21:11.960\n And so always kind of believing that this person\n\n21:11.960 --> 21:13.240\n can be great.\n\n21:13.240 --> 21:14.480\n Exactly.\n\n21:14.480 --> 21:15.800\n You have to communicate that,\n\n21:15.800 --> 21:17.600\n plus the fact that they have to work hard.\n\n21:17.600 --> 21:19.000\n That's it, yeah.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:19.920\n Yeah, and you're right.\n\n21:19.920 --> 21:22.720\n Silicon Valley where I live is filled with people\n\n21:22.720 --> 21:24.520\n who are dropouts at school,\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:28.800\n or who had special needs, who didn't succeed.\n\n21:28.800 --> 21:30.720\n It's very interesting that have gone on\n\n21:30.720 --> 21:34.240\n to do amazing work in creative ways.\n\n21:34.240 --> 21:36.600\n I mean, I do think our school system is set up\n\n21:36.600 --> 21:41.600\n to value good memorizers who can reproduce\n\n21:42.680 --> 21:44.720\n what a teacher is showing them,\n\n21:44.720 --> 21:49.160\n and push away those creative deep thinkers,\n\n21:49.160 --> 21:53.600\n often slower thinkers, they think slowly and deeply.\n\n21:53.600 --> 21:55.320\n And they often get the idea early on\n\n21:55.320 --> 21:59.000\n that they can't be good at maths or other subjects.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.320\n So yeah, I think many of those people\n\n22:02.320 --> 22:05.160\n are the ones who go on and do amazing things.\n\n22:05.160 --> 22:08.280\n So there's a guy named Eric Weinstein.\n\n22:08.280 --> 22:09.800\n I know many mathematicians like this,\n\n22:09.800 --> 22:14.800\n but he talks a lot about having a nonstandard way\n\n22:16.040 --> 22:17.680\n of learning.\n\n22:17.680 --> 22:19.680\n I mean, a lot of great mathematicians,\n\n22:19.680 --> 22:22.080\n a lot of great physicists are like that.\n\n22:22.080 --> 22:24.640\n And he felt like he became quickly,\n\n22:24.640 --> 22:26.360\n he got his PhD at Harvard,\n\n22:26.360 --> 22:28.560\n became quickly an outcast of the system.\n\n22:28.560 --> 22:32.200\n Like the education, especially early education system,\n\n22:32.200 --> 22:33.120\n didn't help him.\n\n22:33.120 --> 22:37.840\n Is there ways for an education system\n\n22:37.840 --> 22:40.320\n to support people like that?\n\n22:40.320 --> 22:42.400\n Is it this kind of multidimensional learning\n\n22:42.400 --> 22:43.240\n that you mentioned?\n\n22:43.240 --> 22:44.280\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n22:44.280 --> 22:48.040\n I mean, I think education system still uses an approach\n\n22:48.040 --> 22:50.320\n that was in classrooms hundreds of years ago.\n\n22:50.320 --> 22:53.720\n The textbooks have a lot to answer for\n\n22:53.720 --> 22:58.320\n in producing this very uninspiring mathematics.\n\n22:58.320 --> 23:00.720\n But yeah, if you open up the subject\n\n23:00.720 --> 23:02.960\n and have people see and solve it in different ways,\n\n23:02.960 --> 23:05.320\n and value those different ways.\n\n23:05.320 --> 23:07.280\n Somebody I appreciated a lot\n\n23:07.280 --> 23:09.680\n is a mathematician called Mary Mizikani.\n\n23:09.680 --> 23:10.560\n I don't know if you've heard of her.\n\n23:10.560 --> 23:12.480\n She won the Fields Medal.\n\n23:12.480 --> 23:14.480\n She was from Iran.\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:15.560\n First woman in the world\n\n23:15.560 --> 23:17.800\n to win the Fields Medal in mathematics.\n\n23:17.800 --> 23:19.480\n She died when she was 40.\n\n23:19.480 --> 23:21.240\n She was at Stanford.\n\n23:21.240 --> 23:24.840\n But her work was entirely visual.\n\n23:24.840 --> 23:27.600\n And she talked about how her daughter\n\n23:27.600 --> 23:28.760\n thought she was an artist\n\n23:28.760 --> 23:30.680\n because she was always visualizing.\n\n23:30.680 --> 23:33.680\n And I attended,\n\n23:33.680 --> 23:35.800\n she asked me to chair the PhD defense\n\n23:35.800 --> 23:37.440\n for one of her students.\n\n23:37.440 --> 23:40.280\n And I went to the defense in the math department.\n\n23:40.280 --> 23:41.440\n And it was so interesting\n\n23:41.440 --> 23:45.280\n because this young woman spent like two hours\n\n23:45.280 --> 23:46.800\n sharing her work.\n\n23:46.800 --> 23:47.800\n All of it was visual.\n\n23:47.800 --> 23:50.480\n In fact, I don't think I saw any numbers at all.\n\n23:50.480 --> 23:51.320\n That's awesome.\n\n23:51.320 --> 23:53.440\n And I remember that day thinking,\n\n23:53.440 --> 23:55.920\n wow, I could have brought her like 13 year old\n\n23:55.920 --> 23:56.960\n into this PhD defense.\n\n23:56.960 --> 24:00.280\n They would not recognize this as maths.\n\n24:00.280 --> 24:03.720\n But when Maryam Izzakhani won the Fields Medal,\n\n24:03.720 --> 24:05.640\n all these other mathematicians were saying\n\n24:05.640 --> 24:07.920\n that her work had connected\n\n24:07.920 --> 24:11.240\n all these previously unconnected areas of maths.\n\n24:11.240 --> 24:14.240\n And so, but when she was,\n\n24:14.240 --> 24:16.120\n she also shared that when she was in school,\n\n24:16.120 --> 24:17.640\n when she was about 13,\n\n24:17.640 --> 24:21.040\n she was told that she couldn't do maths.\n\n24:21.040 --> 24:22.680\n She was told that by her teacher.\n\n24:22.680 --> 24:23.960\n Is this is Iran?\n\n24:23.960 --> 24:24.800\n She grew up in Iran.\n\n24:24.800 --> 24:26.080\n In Iran, yeah.\n\n24:26.080 --> 24:27.360\n So I love that.\n\n24:27.360 --> 24:29.320\n To be told you can't be good at maths\n\n24:29.320 --> 24:33.880\n and then go on and win the Fields Medal is cool.\n\n24:33.880 --> 24:37.120\n I've been told by a lot of people in my life\n\n24:37.120 --> 24:38.200\n that I can't do something.\n\n24:38.200 --> 24:39.840\n I'm very, definitely nonstandard.\n\n24:41.040 --> 24:42.280\n But all it takes,\n\n24:42.280 --> 24:45.360\n that's why people talk about like the one teacher\n\n24:45.360 --> 24:46.200\n that changed everything.\n\n24:46.200 --> 24:47.040\n That's right.\n\n24:47.040 --> 24:48.000\n All it takes is one teacher.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:48.840\n That's right.\n\n24:48.840 --> 24:50.360\n That's the power of that.\n\n24:53.040 --> 24:55.800\n So that's like, that should be inspiring to teachers.\n\n24:55.800 --> 24:57.520\n I think it is.\n\n24:57.520 --> 25:00.000\n You as a single person, given the education system,\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:00.960\n given the incentives,\n\n25:00.960 --> 25:03.240\n you have the power to truly change lives.\n\n25:03.240 --> 25:04.960\n And like 20 years from now,\n\n25:04.960 --> 25:06.640\n I feel as a medalist will walk up to you\n\n25:06.640 --> 25:07.480\n and say thank you.\n\n25:07.480 --> 25:09.320\n Yeah, so you did that for me.\n\n25:09.320 --> 25:10.320\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:12.120\n And I share that with teachers\n\n25:12.120 --> 25:15.520\n that even in this broken system\n\n25:15.520 --> 25:18.920\n of what they have to do for districts and textbooks,\n\n25:19.760 --> 25:22.880\n a single teacher can change kids maths relationship\n\n25:22.880 --> 25:26.440\n or other subjects forever.\n\n25:26.440 --> 25:29.560\n What's the role of the parents in this picture?\n\n25:29.560 --> 25:31.640\n Let's go to another difficult subject.\n\n25:31.640 --> 25:34.080\n Yeah, that is a difficult subject.\n\n25:34.080 --> 25:36.080\n One study found that\n\n25:38.400 --> 25:42.720\n the amount of maths anxiety parents had\n\n25:42.720 --> 25:45.360\n predicted their child's achievement in school,\n\n25:46.640 --> 25:50.360\n but only if they helped with homework.\n\n25:51.200 --> 25:52.560\n So...\n\n25:52.560 --> 25:57.000\n Oh, that's so funny.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.800\n There are some interesting implications for this.\n\n25:59.800 --> 26:01.240\n I mean, you can see how it works.\n\n26:01.240 --> 26:02.480\n If you have maths anxiety\n\n26:02.480 --> 26:03.840\n and you're helping your kids with homework,\n\n26:03.840 --> 26:06.200\n you're probably communicating things like,\n\n26:06.200 --> 26:09.080\n oh, I was terrible at this at school.\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:12.400\n And that's how it gets passed on to kids.\n\n26:12.400 --> 26:14.560\n So one implication is\n\n26:14.560 --> 26:16.920\n if you have a really bad relationship with maths,\n\n26:16.920 --> 26:19.040\n you hate maths, you have maths anxiety,\n\n26:19.040 --> 26:22.840\n just don't do maths homework with your kids.\n\n26:22.840 --> 26:25.840\n But we have on our website,\n\n26:25.840 --> 26:28.480\n we have a little sheet for parents\n\n26:28.480 --> 26:33.480\n of ways to interact around maths with your kids and...\n\n26:33.720 --> 26:36.560\n That's ucubed.org.\n\n26:36.560 --> 26:39.280\n That's ucubed.org, yes.\n\n26:39.280 --> 26:40.920\n So one of the things I say to parents\n\n26:40.920 --> 26:42.960\n when I give parent presentations is\n\n26:42.960 --> 26:44.680\n even if you hate maths,\n\n26:44.680 --> 26:46.760\n you need to just fake it with your kids.\n\n26:46.760 --> 26:49.960\n You should be always endlessly optimistic\n\n26:49.960 --> 26:52.200\n and happy about doing maths.\n\n26:52.200 --> 26:54.040\n And...\n\n26:54.040 --> 26:55.440\n I'm always curious about this.\n\n26:55.440 --> 26:57.840\n So I hope to have kids one day.\n\n26:57.840 --> 26:59.200\n I don't have kids currently.\n\n27:00.840 --> 27:04.080\n Are parents okay with like sucking at maths\n\n27:04.080 --> 27:06.400\n and then trying to get their kid\n\n27:06.400 --> 27:07.840\n to be better than them essentially?\n\n27:07.840 --> 27:09.960\n Like, is that difficult thing for a lot of parents?\n\n27:09.960 --> 27:10.880\n It is difficult.\n\n27:10.880 --> 27:12.840\n To have like, it's almost like an ego thing.\n\n27:12.840 --> 27:15.120\n Like, I never got good at this\n\n27:15.120 --> 27:16.840\n and I probably should have.\n\n27:16.840 --> 27:20.840\n And yeah, I mean, to me, you wanna celebrate that,\n\n27:20.840 --> 27:23.840\n but I know a lot of people struggle with that.\n\n27:23.840 --> 27:25.920\n Like coaches in sports,\n\n27:25.920 --> 27:29.680\n to make an athlete become better than them,\n\n27:29.680 --> 27:31.760\n it can be hard on the ego.\n\n27:31.760 --> 27:32.680\n Yeah.\n\n27:32.680 --> 27:35.680\n So do you experience the same with parents too?\n\n27:35.680 --> 27:38.000\n I think, I mean, I haven't experienced parents\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.800\n worrying that their kids will be better than them.\n\n27:40.800 --> 27:42.800\n I have experienced...\n\n27:42.800 --> 27:45.560\n I have experienced parents\n\n27:45.560 --> 27:47.920\n just having a really bad relationship with maths\n\n27:47.920 --> 27:50.280\n and not wanting to help,\n\n27:50.280 --> 27:54.000\n not knowing how to help, saying things.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.680\n Like another study showed that when mothers\n\n27:56.680 --> 27:58.120\n say to their daughters,\n\n27:58.120 --> 28:00.080\n I was bad at maths in school,\n\n28:00.080 --> 28:02.440\n their daughter's achievement goes down.\n\n28:02.440 --> 28:05.280\n So we know that kids pick up on these messages\n\n28:05.280 --> 28:08.400\n and which is why I say you should fake it.\n\n28:08.400 --> 28:10.160\n But also I know that lots of people\n\n28:10.160 --> 28:12.320\n have just had a really bad relationship with maths,\n\n28:12.320 --> 28:15.120\n even successful people.\n\n28:15.120 --> 28:17.520\n The undergrads I teach at Stanford\n\n28:17.520 --> 28:20.080\n have pretty much always done well in maths,\n\n28:21.040 --> 28:24.040\n but they come to Stanford thinking maths\n\n28:24.040 --> 28:27.000\n is a set of methods to memorize.\n\n28:28.200 --> 28:31.440\n And so, so do many parents believe that.\n\n28:31.440 --> 28:34.320\n There's one method that you memorize\n\n28:34.320 --> 28:36.880\n and then you reproduce it.\n\n28:36.880 --> 28:40.080\n So until people have really had an experience\n\n28:40.080 --> 28:42.280\n of what I think of as the other maths,\n\n28:42.280 --> 28:43.760\n well, until they've really seen\n\n28:43.760 --> 28:45.600\n that it's a really different subject,\n\n28:48.640 --> 28:51.280\n it's hard for them to be able to shift their kids\n\n28:51.280 --> 28:52.640\n to see it differently.\n\n28:52.640 --> 28:55.040\n Is there for a teacher,\n\n28:55.040 --> 28:57.920\n if we were to like systematize it,\n\n28:57.920 --> 28:59.800\n is there something teachers can do\n\n28:59.800 --> 29:01.400\n to do this more effectively?\n\n29:01.400 --> 29:04.040\n So you mentioned the textbook.\n\n29:04.040 --> 29:04.880\n Yeah.\n\n29:04.880 --> 29:07.200\n So what are the additional things\n\n29:07.200 --> 29:10.000\n you can add on top of this whole old school\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:14.720\n traditional way of teaching that can improve the process?\n\n29:14.720 --> 29:17.560\n So I do think there's a way of teaching maths\n\n29:17.560 --> 29:21.680\n that changes everything for kids and teachers.\n\n29:21.680 --> 29:25.480\n So I'm one of five writers of a new framework\n\n29:25.480 --> 29:27.600\n for the state of California, a new maths framework.\n\n29:27.600 --> 29:29.240\n It's coming out next year.\n\n29:29.240 --> 29:32.280\n And we are recommending through this maths framework\n\n29:32.280 --> 29:33.880\n that people teach in this way.\n\n29:33.880 --> 29:37.520\n It's called teaching to big ideas.\n\n29:37.520 --> 29:42.520\n So at the moment, people have standards\n\n29:42.520 --> 29:43.440\n that have been written,\n\n29:43.440 --> 29:45.760\n and then textbooks have taken these standards\n\n29:45.760 --> 29:48.840\n and made not very good questions.\n\n29:48.840 --> 29:50.480\n And if you look at the standards,\n\n29:50.480 --> 29:53.040\n like I have some written down here,\n\n29:53.040 --> 29:54.560\n just reading the standards,\n\n29:54.560 --> 29:57.760\n it makes maths seem really boring and uninspiring.\n\n29:57.760 --> 30:00.880\n What are the kind of, can you give a few examples?\n\n30:00.880 --> 30:03.160\n So this is an interesting example.\n\n30:03.160 --> 30:06.160\n In third grade, there are three different standards\n\n30:06.160 --> 30:07.640\n about unit squares.\n\n30:10.480 --> 30:11.640\n Okay.\n\n30:11.640 --> 30:12.600\n So this is one of them.\n\n30:12.600 --> 30:16.120\n A square with side length one unit, called a unit square,\n\n30:16.120 --> 30:18.760\n is said to have one square unit of area\n\n30:18.760 --> 30:20.560\n and can be used to measure area.\n\n30:20.560 --> 30:23.400\n And that's something you're expected to learn?\n\n30:23.400 --> 30:25.600\n That is something, so that's a standard.\n\n30:25.600 --> 30:26.920\n The textbook authors say,\n\n30:26.920 --> 30:28.400\n oh, I'm gonna make a question about that.\n\n30:28.400 --> 30:32.160\n And they translate the standards into narrow questions.\n\n30:32.160 --> 30:33.960\n And then you measure success by your ability\n\n30:33.960 --> 30:36.880\n to deliver on these standards.\n\n30:36.880 --> 30:40.240\n So the standards themselves, I think of maths\n\n30:40.240 --> 30:41.800\n and many people think of maths in this way\n\n30:41.800 --> 30:44.760\n as a subject of like a few big ideas\n\n30:44.760 --> 30:47.120\n and really important connections between them.\n\n30:48.200 --> 30:50.400\n So you could think of it as like a network map\n\n30:50.400 --> 30:52.600\n of ideas and connections.\n\n30:52.600 --> 30:55.800\n And what standards do is they take that beautiful map\n\n30:55.800 --> 30:58.720\n and they chop it up like this into lots of little pieces\n\n30:58.720 --> 31:01.000\n and they deliver the pieces to schools.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:05.240\n And so teachers don't see the connections between ideas,\n\n31:05.240 --> 31:06.400\n nor do the kids.\n\n31:06.400 --> 31:08.400\n So anyway, this is a bit of a long way of saying\n\n31:08.400 --> 31:11.840\n that what we've done in this new initiative\n\n31:11.840 --> 31:16.080\n is we have set out maths as a set of big ideas\n\n31:16.080 --> 31:17.520\n and connections between them.\n\n31:17.520 --> 31:20.840\n So this is grade three.\n\n31:20.840 --> 31:25.120\n So instead of there being 60 standards,\n\n31:25.120 --> 31:29.640\n we've said, well, you can pull these different standards\n\n31:29.640 --> 31:32.200\n to get in with each other\n\n31:32.200 --> 31:37.200\n and also value the ways these are connected.\n\n31:38.040 --> 31:39.840\n And by the way, for people who are just listening,\n\n31:39.840 --> 31:44.000\n we're looking at a small number of like big concepts\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.400\n within mathematics, square towels,\n\n31:46.400 --> 31:49.040\n measuring fraction, shape and time,\n\n31:49.040 --> 31:51.680\n and then how they're interconnected.\n\n31:51.680 --> 31:55.040\n And so the goal, this is for grade three, for example.\n\n31:55.040 --> 31:58.960\n Yeah, and so we've set out for the state of California,\n\n31:58.960 --> 32:02.520\n the whole of mathematics K10\n\n32:02.520 --> 32:05.120\n as a set of big ideas and connections.\n\n32:05.120 --> 32:08.480\n So we know that teachers, it works really well\n\n32:08.480 --> 32:13.480\n if they say, okay, so a big idea in my grade is measuring.\n\n32:15.560 --> 32:19.160\n And instead of reading five procedural statements\n\n32:19.160 --> 32:21.440\n that involve measuring, they think,\n\n32:21.440 --> 32:22.560\n okay, measuring is a big idea.\n\n32:22.560 --> 32:25.360\n What rich, deep activity can I use\n\n32:25.360 --> 32:27.880\n that teaches measuring to kids?\n\n32:27.880 --> 32:30.440\n And as kids work on these deep, rich activities,\n\n32:30.440 --> 32:32.600\n maybe over a few days,\n\n32:32.600 --> 32:34.920\n turns out a lot of maths comes into it.\n\n32:35.800 --> 32:40.120\n So we're recommending that let's not teach maths\n\n32:40.120 --> 32:43.400\n according to all these multiple statements\n\n32:43.400 --> 32:45.560\n and lots and lots of short questions.\n\n32:45.560 --> 32:47.480\n Instead, let's teach maths\n\n32:47.480 --> 32:49.240\n by thinking about what are the big ideas\n\n32:49.240 --> 32:52.240\n and what are really rich, deep activities\n\n32:52.240 --> 32:53.720\n that teach those big ideas.\n\n32:53.720 --> 32:55.880\n So that's the, like how you teach it\n\n32:55.880 --> 32:57.600\n and maximize learning.\n\n32:57.600 --> 33:01.440\n What about like from a school district perspective,\n\n33:01.440 --> 33:04.640\n like measuring how well you're doing,\n\n33:04.640 --> 33:07.000\n grades and tests and stuff like that.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.880\n Do you throw those out or is it possible?\n\n33:08.880 --> 33:13.440\n I am not a fan of grades and tests myself.\n\n33:13.440 --> 33:15.920\n I think grades are fine\n\n33:15.920 --> 33:18.960\n if they're used at the end of a course.\n\n33:18.960 --> 33:21.000\n So at the end of my maths course,\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.080\n I might get a grade because a grade is meant\n\n33:23.080 --> 33:24.360\n to be a summative measure.\n\n33:24.360 --> 33:27.680\n It kind of describes your summative achievement.\n\n33:27.680 --> 33:30.040\n But the problem we have in maths classrooms\n\n33:30.040 --> 33:33.440\n across the US is people use grades all the time,\n\n33:33.440 --> 33:36.360\n every week or every day even.\n\n33:36.360 --> 33:38.560\n My own kids, when they went through high school,\n\n33:38.560 --> 33:40.560\n technology has not helped with this.\n\n33:40.560 --> 33:41.800\n When they went through high school,\n\n33:41.800 --> 33:42.840\n they knew they were being graded\n\n33:42.840 --> 33:45.880\n for everything they did, everything.\n\n33:45.880 --> 33:48.120\n And not only were they being graded for everything,\n\n33:48.120 --> 33:50.400\n but they could see it in the grade book online\n\n33:50.400 --> 33:52.880\n and it would alter every class they went into.\n\n33:52.880 --> 33:54.920\n So this is the ultimate,\n\n33:54.920 --> 33:57.480\n what I think of as a performance culture.\n\n33:57.480 --> 34:00.120\n You're there to perform, somebody's measuring you,\n\n34:00.120 --> 34:01.840\n you see your score.\n\n34:03.720 --> 34:08.600\n So I think that's not conducive for deep learning.\n\n34:08.600 --> 34:10.960\n And yes, have a grade at the end of the year,\n\n34:10.960 --> 34:12.400\n but during the year,\n\n34:12.400 --> 34:14.600\n you can assess kids in much better ways.\n\n34:14.600 --> 34:18.720\n Like teachers can, a great way of assessing kids\n\n34:18.720 --> 34:22.080\n is to give them a rubric that kind of outlines\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:24.000\n what they're learning over the course of a unit\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:25.760\n or a few weeks.\n\n34:25.760 --> 34:28.760\n So kids can actually see the journey they're on,\n\n34:28.760 --> 34:31.120\n like this is what we're doing mathematically.\n\n34:31.120 --> 34:34.360\n Sometimes they self assess on those units\n\n34:34.360 --> 34:39.360\n and then teachers will show what the kids can do\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.160\n with a rubric and also write notes.\n\n34:42.160 --> 34:43.560\n Like in the next few weeks,\n\n34:43.560 --> 34:45.960\n you might like to learn to do this.\n\n34:48.160 --> 34:49.840\n So instead of kids just thinking about,\n\n34:49.840 --> 34:51.160\n I'm an A kid or a B kid,\n\n34:51.160 --> 34:53.200\n or I have this letter attached to me,\n\n34:53.200 --> 34:56.920\n they're actually seeing mathematically what's important\n\n34:56.920 --> 34:58.600\n and they're involved in the process\n\n34:58.600 --> 35:02.320\n of knowing where they are mathematically.\n\n35:02.320 --> 35:04.840\n At the end of the year, sure, they can have a grade,\n\n35:04.840 --> 35:06.240\n but during the year,\n\n35:06.240 --> 35:09.200\n they get these much more informative measures.\n\n35:10.160 --> 35:14.760\n I do think this might be more for college,\n\n35:14.760 --> 35:16.320\n but maybe not.\n\n35:16.320 --> 35:18.640\n Some of the best classes I've had\n\n35:18.640 --> 35:23.640\n is when I got a special like set aside,\n\n35:23.720 --> 35:27.840\n like the professor clearly saw that I was interested\n\n35:27.840 --> 35:29.880\n in some aspect of a thing.\n\n35:29.880 --> 35:34.760\n And then I have a few in mind and one in particular,\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:38.080\n when he said that he kind of challenged me.\n\n35:38.080 --> 35:41.320\n So this is outside of grades and all that kind of stuff\n\n35:41.320 --> 35:44.880\n that basically it's like reverse psychology.\n\n35:44.880 --> 35:47.200\n I don't think this can be done.\n\n35:47.200 --> 35:50.960\n And so I gave everything to do that particular thing.\n\n35:50.960 --> 35:54.320\n So this happened to be in an artificial intelligence class.\n\n35:54.320 --> 35:57.600\n But I think that like special treatment\n\n35:57.600 --> 36:01.840\n of taking students who are especially like excellent\n\n36:01.840 --> 36:03.480\n at a particular little aspect,\n\n36:03.480 --> 36:06.120\n that you see their eyes light up.\n\n36:06.120 --> 36:09.480\n I often think like maybe it's tempting for a teacher\n\n36:09.480 --> 36:11.680\n to think you've already succeeded there,\n\n36:11.680 --> 36:13.400\n but they're actually signaling to you\n\n36:13.400 --> 36:17.280\n that like you could really launch them on their way.\n\n36:18.600 --> 36:21.640\n And I don't know, that's too much to expect from teachers\n\n36:21.640 --> 36:24.920\n I think to pay attention to all of that\n\n36:24.920 --> 36:25.960\n because it's really difficult.\n\n36:25.960 --> 36:30.000\n But I just kind of remember who are the biggest,\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.320\n the most important people in the history\n\n36:32.320 --> 36:34.840\n of my life of education.\n\n36:34.840 --> 36:37.880\n And it's those people that who really didn't just\n\n36:37.880 --> 36:40.400\n like inspire me with their awesomeness, which they did,\n\n36:40.400 --> 36:42.840\n but also just they pushed me a little.\n\n36:42.840 --> 36:45.200\n Like they gave me a little push.\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:47.480\n And that requires focusing on the quote unquote\n\n36:47.480 --> 36:50.520\n excellent students in the class.\n\n36:50.520 --> 36:53.840\n Yeah, I think what's important though is teachers\n\n36:53.840 --> 36:56.040\n to have the perspective that they don't know\n\n36:56.040 --> 36:58.480\n who's gonna be excellent at something\n\n36:58.480 --> 37:00.320\n before they give out the activity.\n\n37:00.320 --> 37:01.160\n Exactly.\n\n37:01.160 --> 37:04.760\n And in our camp classes that we ran,\n\n37:05.720 --> 37:10.440\n sometimes students would finish ahead of other students.\n\n37:10.440 --> 37:15.280\n And we would say to them, can you write a question\n\n37:15.280 --> 37:16.880\n that's like this but different?\n\n37:19.080 --> 37:21.440\n Oh, and over time we encourage them\n\n37:21.440 --> 37:24.800\n to like extend things further.\n\n37:24.800 --> 37:26.800\n I remember we were doing one activity\n\n37:26.800 --> 37:30.160\n where kids were working out the borders of a square\n\n37:30.160 --> 37:33.560\n and how big this border would be in different case sizes.\n\n37:33.560 --> 37:36.280\n And one of the boys came up at the end of the class\n\n37:36.280 --> 37:38.880\n and said, I've been thinking about how you do this\n\n37:38.880 --> 37:40.480\n to the Pentagon.\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:42.200\n And I said, that's fantastic.\n\n37:42.200 --> 37:44.440\n How do you, what does it look like with Pentagon?\n\n37:44.440 --> 37:47.200\n Go find out, see if you can discover.\n\n37:47.200 --> 37:49.720\n So I didn't know he was gonna come up and say that.\n\n37:49.720 --> 37:53.560\n And I didn't have in my head like this is the kid\n\n37:53.560 --> 37:55.600\n who could have this extension task,\n\n37:55.600 --> 37:58.800\n but you can still do that as a teacher.\n\n37:59.720 --> 38:01.320\n When kids get excited about something\n\n38:01.320 --> 38:03.160\n or they're doing well in something,\n\n38:03.160 --> 38:06.200\n have them extend it, go further.\n\n38:06.200 --> 38:07.040\n It's great.\n\n38:07.040 --> 38:10.480\n And then you also, like this is like teacher and coach,\n\n38:11.680 --> 38:13.920\n you could say it in different ways to different students.\n\n38:13.920 --> 38:18.920\n Like for me, the right thing to say is almost to say,\n\n38:18.920 --> 38:21.320\n I don't think you could do this, this is too hard.\n\n38:21.320 --> 38:23.080\n Like that's what I need to hear.\n\n38:23.080 --> 38:26.320\n It's just like, no, there's immediate push.\n\n38:26.320 --> 38:29.200\n But with some people, if they're a little bit more,\n\n38:29.200 --> 38:31.200\n I mean, it's all has to do with upbringing,\n\n38:31.200 --> 38:33.200\n how your genetics is.\n\n38:33.200 --> 38:35.360\n They might be much more, that might break them.\n\n38:35.360 --> 38:36.200\n Yeah, that might break them.\n\n38:36.200 --> 38:38.320\n And so you have to be also sensitive to that.\n\n38:38.320 --> 38:42.200\n I mean, teaching is really difficult for this very reason.\n\n38:42.200 --> 38:43.200\n It is.\n\n38:43.200 --> 38:47.720\n So what is the best way to teach math,\n\n38:47.720 --> 38:50.760\n to learn math at those early few days\n\n38:50.760 --> 38:52.360\n when you just wanna capture them?\n\n38:53.680 --> 38:56.320\n I do something, actually there's a video of me\n\n38:56.320 --> 38:58.840\n doing this on our website that I love\n\n38:58.840 --> 39:03.160\n when I first meet students.\n\n39:03.160 --> 39:04.280\n And this is what I do.\n\n39:04.280 --> 39:08.240\n I show them a picture, this is the picture I show them.\n\n39:08.240 --> 39:11.000\n And it's a picture of seven dots like this.\n\n39:12.960 --> 39:15.720\n And I show it for just a few seconds and I say to them,\n\n39:15.720 --> 39:17.640\n I'd like you to tell me how many dots there are,\n\n39:17.640 --> 39:19.120\n but I don't want you to count them.\n\n39:19.120 --> 39:20.800\n I want you to group the dots.\n\n39:20.800 --> 39:24.120\n And I show it them and then I take it away\n\n39:24.120 --> 39:27.040\n before they've even had enough time to count them.\n\n39:27.040 --> 39:29.720\n And then I ask them, so how did you see it?\n\n39:29.720 --> 39:34.720\n And I go around the room and amazingly enough,\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:36.960\n there's probably 18 different ways\n\n39:36.960 --> 39:38.280\n of seeing these seven dots.\n\n39:39.240 --> 39:42.240\n And so I ask people, tell me how you grouped it.\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:44.320\n And some people see it as like an outside hole\n\n39:44.320 --> 39:45.680\n with a center dot.\n\n39:45.680 --> 39:49.240\n Some people see like stripes of lines.\n\n39:49.240 --> 39:51.760\n Some people see segments.\n\n39:51.760 --> 39:53.760\n And I collect them all and I put them on the board.\n\n39:53.760 --> 39:55.400\n And at the end I say, look at this,\n\n39:55.400 --> 39:57.240\n we are a class of 30 kids\n\n39:57.240 --> 40:00.240\n and we saw these seven dots in 18 different ways.\n\n40:00.240 --> 40:01.880\n There's actually a mathematical term for this.\n\n40:01.880 --> 40:03.760\n It's called groupitizing.\n\n40:03.760 --> 40:04.720\n Groupitizing?\n\n40:04.720 --> 40:05.560\n Yeah.\n\n40:05.560 --> 40:06.720\n I like it.\n\n40:06.720 --> 40:07.560\n It's kind of cool.\n\n40:07.560 --> 40:11.840\n So turns out though that how well you groupitize\n\n40:11.840 --> 40:15.480\n predicts how well you do in maths.\n\n40:15.480 --> 40:18.920\n Is it a raw talent or is it just something\n\n40:18.920 --> 40:19.760\n that you can develop?\n\n40:19.760 --> 40:20.600\n I don't think it's raw.\n\n40:20.600 --> 40:22.600\n I don't think you're born groupitizing, I think,\n\n40:22.600 --> 40:27.280\n but some kids have developed that ability if you like.\n\n40:27.280 --> 40:28.960\n And you can learn it.\n\n40:28.960 --> 40:33.960\n So this to me is part of how wrong we have maths.\n\n40:34.120 --> 40:36.600\n That we think to tell whether a kid's good at maths,\n\n40:36.600 --> 40:40.600\n we're gonna give them a speed test on multiples.\n\n40:40.600 --> 40:43.880\n But actually seeing how kids group dots\n\n40:43.880 --> 40:46.120\n could be a more important assessment\n\n40:46.120 --> 40:48.200\n of how well they're gonna do in maths.\n\n40:48.200 --> 40:49.560\n Anyway, I diverge.\n\n40:49.560 --> 40:52.280\n What I like to do though when I start off with kids\n\n40:52.280 --> 40:54.520\n is show them I'm gonna give you maths problems.\n\n40:54.520 --> 40:57.040\n I'm gonna value the different ways you see them.\n\n40:57.040 --> 40:59.840\n And it turns out you can do this kind of problem\n\n40:59.840 --> 41:03.000\n asking people how they group dots with young children\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.400\n or with graduate students.\n\n41:05.400 --> 41:08.160\n And it's engaging for all of them.\n\n41:10.480 --> 41:12.080\n You talk about creativity a little bit\n\n41:12.080 --> 41:15.120\n and flexibility in your book Limitless.\n\n41:15.120 --> 41:16.680\n What's the role of that?\n\n41:16.680 --> 41:19.680\n So it sounds like there's a bit of that kind of thing\n\n41:19.680 --> 41:22.600\n involved in groupitizing.\n\n41:22.600 --> 41:24.520\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n41:24.520 --> 41:25.600\n I love this term.\n\n41:25.600 --> 41:28.480\n So what would you say is the role of creativity\n\n41:28.480 --> 41:31.240\n and flexibility in the learning of maths?\n\n41:31.240 --> 41:34.720\n I think what we know now is that what we need\n\n41:34.720 --> 41:39.720\n for this 21st century world we live in is a flexible mind.\n\n41:42.040 --> 41:44.360\n School should not really be about teaching kids\n\n41:44.360 --> 41:46.200\n particular methods but teaching them\n\n41:46.200 --> 41:49.440\n to approach problems with flexibility.\n\n41:49.440 --> 41:52.840\n Being creative, thinking creatively is really important.\n\n41:52.840 --> 41:56.960\n So people don't think the words maths and creativity\n\n41:56.960 --> 42:00.240\n come together, but that's what I love about maths\n\n42:00.240 --> 42:02.880\n is the creative different ways you can see it.\n\n42:02.880 --> 42:07.880\n And so helping our kids, there's a book I like a lot\n\n42:08.600 --> 42:13.600\n by physicists, you probably know this book called Elastic.\n\n42:13.920 --> 42:14.840\n You might know it.\n\n42:15.800 --> 42:18.440\n And it's about how we want elastic minds.\n\n42:18.440 --> 42:21.440\n Same kind of thing, flexible, creative minds.\n\n42:21.440 --> 42:26.440\n And schools do very little on developing that kind of mind.\n\n42:26.800 --> 42:31.720\n They do a lot of developing the kind of mind\n\n42:31.720 --> 42:35.280\n that a computer now does for us.\n\n42:35.280 --> 42:36.520\n Memorization.\n\n42:36.520 --> 42:41.520\n Memorization, doing procedures, a lot of things\n\n42:41.880 --> 42:45.320\n that we spend a lot of time in school on.\n\n42:45.320 --> 42:47.480\n In the world, when kids leave school,\n\n42:47.480 --> 42:52.480\n a computer will do that and better than they will.\n\n42:52.520 --> 42:54.840\n But that creative, flexible thinking,\n\n42:54.840 --> 42:57.120\n we're kind of at ground zero at computers\n\n42:57.120 --> 42:59.480\n being able to engage in that thinking.\n\n42:59.480 --> 43:00.880\n Maybe we're a little above ground zero,\n\n43:00.880 --> 43:05.760\n but the human brain is perfectly suited\n\n43:05.760 --> 43:07.520\n for that creative, flexible thinking.\n\n43:07.520 --> 43:09.840\n That's what humans are so great at.\n\n43:09.840 --> 43:12.040\n So I would like the balance to shift in schools.\n\n43:12.040 --> 43:15.120\n Maybe you still need to do some procedural kind of thinking,\n\n43:15.120 --> 43:17.680\n but there should be a lot more of that creative,\n\n43:17.680 --> 43:18.880\n flexible thinking.\n\n43:20.160 --> 43:24.000\n And what's the role of other humans in this picture?\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:29.000\n So collaborative learning, so brainstorming together.\n\n43:29.400 --> 43:33.760\n So creativity as it emerges from the collective intelligence\n\n43:33.760 --> 43:34.600\n of multiple humans.\n\n43:34.600 --> 43:36.520\n Yeah, super important.\n\n43:36.520 --> 43:40.600\n And we know that also helps develop your brain,\n\n43:40.600 --> 43:42.360\n that social side of thinking.\n\n43:42.360 --> 43:44.920\n And I love mathematics collaboration\n\n43:44.920 --> 43:47.560\n where people build on each other's ideas\n\n43:47.560 --> 43:49.760\n and they come up with amazing things.\n\n43:49.760 --> 43:54.080\n I actually taught a hundred students calculus\n\n43:54.080 --> 43:56.880\n at Stanford recently, undergrads,\n\n43:56.880 --> 43:59.440\n and we taught them to collaborate.\n\n43:59.440 --> 44:01.280\n So these students came in Stanford\n\n44:01.280 --> 44:04.640\n and most of them were against collaboration in math.\n\n44:04.640 --> 44:06.240\n This is before COVID in person?\n\n44:06.240 --> 44:08.360\n Yeah, it was just before COVID hit.\n\n44:08.360 --> 44:10.240\n It was 2019.\n\n44:10.240 --> 44:12.080\n And this summer.\n\n44:12.080 --> 44:13.800\n So you said they're against?\n\n44:13.800 --> 44:16.720\n Yeah, so it's really interesting.\n\n44:16.720 --> 44:20.160\n So they'd only experienced maths individually\n\n44:20.160 --> 44:22.080\n in a kind of competitive individual way.\n\n44:22.080 --> 44:24.640\n And if they had experienced it as group work,\n\n44:24.640 --> 44:26.560\n it had been a bad experience.\n\n44:26.560 --> 44:28.800\n Like maybe they were the one who did it all\n\n44:28.800 --> 44:31.480\n and the others didn't do much.\n\n44:31.480 --> 44:33.120\n So they were kind of against collaboration.\n\n44:33.120 --> 44:35.080\n They didn't see any role for it in maths.\n\n44:35.080 --> 44:39.720\n And we taught them to collaborate and it was hard work\n\n44:39.720 --> 44:42.120\n because as well as the fact\n\n44:42.120 --> 44:43.520\n that they were kind of against collaboration,\n\n44:43.520 --> 44:48.440\n they came in with a lot of like social comparison thinking.\n\n44:48.440 --> 44:51.440\n So I'm in this room with other Stanford undergrads\n\n44:51.440 --> 44:53.480\n and they're better than me or...\n\n44:53.480 --> 44:55.720\n So when we set them to work on a maths problem together,\n\n44:55.720 --> 44:57.200\n the first one was kind of a disaster\n\n44:57.200 --> 44:59.200\n because they put all like, they're better than me.\n\n44:59.200 --> 45:00.440\n They're faster than me.\n\n45:00.440 --> 45:02.560\n They came up with something I didn't come up with.\n\n45:02.560 --> 45:05.920\n So we taught them to let go of that thinking\n\n45:05.920 --> 45:08.560\n and to work well together.\n\n45:08.560 --> 45:10.760\n And one of the things we did, we decided\n\n45:10.760 --> 45:12.520\n we wanted to do a pre and post test\n\n45:12.520 --> 45:13.440\n at the end of this teaching.\n\n45:13.440 --> 45:16.440\n It was only four weeks long, but we knew\n\n45:16.440 --> 45:18.320\n we didn't want to give them like a time test\n\n45:18.320 --> 45:19.280\n of individual work.\n\n45:19.280 --> 45:23.680\n So we gave them an applied problem to do at the beginning\n\n45:23.680 --> 45:26.160\n and we gave them to do in pairs together.\n\n45:26.160 --> 45:28.560\n And we gave each of them a different colored pen\n\n45:28.560 --> 45:30.960\n and said, work on this activity together\n\n45:30.960 --> 45:33.000\n and keep using that pen.\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.120\n So then we had all these pieces of student work.\n\n45:35.120 --> 45:37.520\n And what we saw was they just worked\n\n45:37.520 --> 45:39.160\n on separate parts of the paper.\n\n45:39.160 --> 45:42.000\n So there's a little like red pen section\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.680\n and a green pen section.\n\n45:43.680 --> 45:45.880\n And they didn't do that well on it.\n\n45:45.880 --> 45:48.760\n Even though it was a problem that middle\n\n45:48.760 --> 45:49.760\n or high school kids could do,\n\n45:49.760 --> 45:52.680\n but it was like a problem solving kind of problem.\n\n45:52.680 --> 45:55.000\n And then we gave them the same one to do at the end,\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:56.160\n gave them the same colors.\n\n45:56.160 --> 45:59.160\n And actually they had learned to collaborate.\n\n45:59.160 --> 46:02.080\n And not only were they collaborating the second time round,\n\n46:02.080 --> 46:04.000\n but that boosted their achievement.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:07.840\n And the ones who collaborated did better on the problem.\n\n46:07.840 --> 46:10.200\n Collaboration is important, having people,\n\n46:10.200 --> 46:12.480\n and what was so eye opening for these undergrads\n\n46:12.480 --> 46:15.320\n and they talked about it in lovely ways\n\n46:15.320 --> 46:19.920\n was I learned to value other people's thinking on a problem.\n\n46:19.920 --> 46:22.280\n And I learned to value that other people\n\n46:22.280 --> 46:24.280\n saw it in different ways.\n\n46:24.280 --> 46:29.280\n And it was quite a big experience for them\n\n46:29.440 --> 46:31.680\n that they came out thinking,\n\n46:31.680 --> 46:33.600\n I can do maths with other people.\n\n46:33.600 --> 46:34.800\n People can see it differently.\n\n46:34.800 --> 46:38.280\n We can build on each other's ways of thinking.\n\n46:38.280 --> 46:39.480\n I got a chance to,\n\n46:39.480 --> 46:42.000\n I don't know if you know who Daniel Kahneman is,\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.080\n got a chance to interact with him.\n\n46:44.080 --> 46:45.360\n And like the first,\n\n46:45.360 --> 46:46.880\n cause he had a few,\n\n46:46.880 --> 46:50.480\n but one famous collaboration throughout his life\n\n46:51.960 --> 46:52.920\n with Tversky.\n\n46:52.920 --> 46:55.920\n And just like, you know,\n\n46:55.920 --> 46:58.520\n he hasn't met me before in person,\n\n46:58.520 --> 47:01.280\n but just the number of questions he was asking,\n\n47:01.280 --> 47:03.120\n just the curiosity.\n\n47:03.120 --> 47:05.360\n So I think one of the skills,\n\n47:05.360 --> 47:07.920\n the collaboration itself is a skill.\n\n47:07.920 --> 47:10.720\n And I remember my experience with him was like,\n\n47:10.720 --> 47:14.000\n okay, I get why you're so good at collaboration\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:17.440\n because he was just extremely good at listening\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:21.400\n and genuine curiosity about how the other person\n\n47:21.400 --> 47:23.360\n thinks about the world, sees the world.\n\n47:23.360 --> 47:24.920\n And then together he's,\n\n47:24.920 --> 47:27.440\n he pulled me in in that particular case.\n\n47:27.440 --> 47:29.320\n He doesn't know in particular,\n\n47:29.320 --> 47:31.160\n like that much about autonomous vehicles,\n\n47:31.160 --> 47:34.520\n but he kept like asking all of these questions.\n\n47:34.520 --> 47:36.400\n And then like 10 minutes in,\n\n47:36.400 --> 47:38.080\n we're together trying to solve the problem\n\n47:38.080 --> 47:39.880\n of autonomous driving.\n\n47:39.880 --> 47:43.080\n And like, and that, I mean, that's really fulfilling.\n\n47:43.080 --> 47:43.920\n That's really enriching.\n\n47:43.920 --> 47:46.680\n But it also in that moment made me realize\n\n47:46.680 --> 47:48.160\n it's kind of a skill.\n\n47:48.160 --> 47:50.720\n Cause you have to kind of put your ego aside,\n\n47:50.720 --> 47:52.480\n put your view of the world aside\n\n47:52.480 --> 47:55.760\n and try to learn how the other person sees it.\n\n47:55.760 --> 47:57.560\n And the other thing you have to put aside\n\n47:57.560 --> 48:00.640\n is this social comparison thinking.\n\n48:00.640 --> 48:03.240\n Like if you are sitting there thinking,\n\n48:03.240 --> 48:04.800\n wow, that was an amazing idea.\n\n48:04.800 --> 48:06.600\n He's so much better than I am.\n\n48:06.600 --> 48:09.960\n That's really gonna stop you taking on\n\n48:09.960 --> 48:12.160\n the value of that idea.\n\n48:12.160 --> 48:14.240\n And so there's a lot of that going on\n\n48:14.240 --> 48:17.400\n between these Stanford students when they came.\n\n48:17.400 --> 48:21.880\n And trying to help them let go of that.\n\n48:21.880 --> 48:24.240\n One of the things I've discovered\n\n48:24.240 --> 48:27.320\n just because being a little bit more in the public eye,\n\n48:27.320 --> 48:31.240\n how rewarding it is to celebrate others.\n\n48:31.240 --> 48:35.760\n And how much is going to actually pay off in the long term.\n\n48:35.760 --> 48:38.160\n So this kind of silo thinking of like,\n\n48:38.160 --> 48:41.200\n I want to prove to a small set of people around me\n\n48:41.200 --> 48:45.280\n that I'm really smart and do so\n\n48:45.280 --> 48:47.440\n by basically not celebrating\n\n48:47.440 --> 48:48.760\n how smart the other people are.\n\n48:48.760 --> 48:51.480\n That's actually maybe short term,\n\n48:51.480 --> 48:54.520\n it seems like a good strategy, but long term it's not.\n\n48:54.520 --> 48:56.440\n And I think if you practice at the student level\n\n48:56.440 --> 48:58.840\n and then at the career level, at every single stage,\n\n48:58.840 --> 49:00.440\n I think that's ultimately.\n\n49:00.440 --> 49:01.280\n I agree with you.\n\n49:01.280 --> 49:04.400\n I think that's a really good way of thinking about it.\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:08.240\n You mentioned textbooks and you didn't say it,\n\n49:11.240 --> 49:15.400\n maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to teach mathematics,\n\n49:15.400 --> 49:16.920\n but I love textbooks.\n\n49:16.920 --> 49:18.560\n They're like pretty pictures\n\n49:18.560 --> 49:19.880\n and they smell nice and they open.\n\n49:19.880 --> 49:21.640\n I mean, I talk about like physical.\n\n49:21.640 --> 49:25.360\n Some of my greatest experiences have been just like,\n\n49:25.360 --> 49:27.240\n cause they're really well done.\n\n49:27.240 --> 49:30.440\n When we're talking about basic, like high school,\n\n49:30.440 --> 49:34.880\n calculus, biology, chemistry, those are like,\n\n49:34.880 --> 49:36.840\n those are incredible.\n\n49:36.840 --> 49:40.320\n It's like Wikipedia, but with color and a nice little.\n\n49:40.320 --> 49:41.920\n You must've seen some good textbooks\n\n49:41.920 --> 49:44.520\n if they had pretty pictures and color.\n\n49:44.520 --> 49:46.200\n Yeah, I mean, I remember,\n\n49:46.200 --> 49:51.200\n I guess it was very, very standard, like AP calculus,\n\n49:51.200 --> 49:53.480\n AP biology, AP chemistry.\n\n49:53.480 --> 49:56.080\n I felt those were like some of the happiest days of my life\n\n49:56.080 --> 49:58.000\n in terms of learning was high school.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.760\n Cause it was very easy, honestly.\n\n50:01.960 --> 50:03.240\n It felt hard at the time,\n\n50:03.240 --> 50:07.080\n but you're basically doing a whirlwind tour\n\n50:07.080 --> 50:08.400\n of all the science.\n\n50:08.400 --> 50:09.400\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n50:09.400 --> 50:12.160\n Without having to pick, you do literature,\n\n50:12.160 --> 50:16.680\n you do like Shakespeare, calculus, biology, physics,\n\n50:17.640 --> 50:19.040\n chemistry, what else?\n\n50:19.040 --> 50:23.520\n Anatomy, physiology, computer science,\n\n50:23.520 --> 50:26.680\n without like, nobody's telling you what to do with your life.\n\n50:26.680 --> 50:28.000\n You're just doing all of those things.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:29.640\n That's a good thing, you're right.\n\n50:29.640 --> 50:32.440\n But I remember the textbooks weren't,\n\n50:32.440 --> 50:35.400\n I mean, maybe I'm romanticizing the past,\n\n50:35.400 --> 50:38.640\n but I remember they weren't, they're pretty good.\n\n50:38.640 --> 50:42.000\n But so you think, what role do you think they play still?\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:45.480\n And like in this more modern digital age,\n\n50:45.480 --> 50:48.360\n what's the best materials with which to do\n\n50:48.360 --> 50:50.040\n these kinds of educations?\n\n50:50.040 --> 50:52.840\n Well, I'm intrigued that you had such a good experience\n\n50:52.840 --> 50:53.680\n with textbooks.\n\n50:53.680 --> 50:57.080\n I mean, I can remember loving some textbooks I had\n\n50:57.080 --> 50:59.440\n when I was learning and I love books.\n\n50:59.440 --> 51:03.040\n I love to pick up books and look through them,\n\n51:03.040 --> 51:06.480\n but a lot of maths textbooks\n\n51:06.480 --> 51:08.760\n are not good experiences for kids.\n\n51:08.760 --> 51:12.840\n They, we have a video on our website\n\n51:12.840 --> 51:14.080\n of the kids who came to our camp\n\n51:14.080 --> 51:15.600\n and one of the students says,\n\n51:15.600 --> 51:18.760\n in maths, you have to follow the textbook.\n\n51:18.760 --> 51:20.480\n The textbook is kind of like the Bible.\n\n51:20.480 --> 51:22.400\n You have to follow it.\n\n51:22.400 --> 51:25.920\n And every day it's slightly different.\n\n51:25.920 --> 51:28.760\n Like on Monday you do 2.3.2\n\n51:28.760 --> 51:32.480\n and on Tuesday you do 2.3.3 and on Wednesday.\n\n51:32.480 --> 51:35.080\n And you never go off that.\n\n51:35.080 --> 51:37.840\n That's like every single day.\n\n51:37.840 --> 51:42.520\n And that's not inspiring for a lot of the kids.\n\n51:43.520 --> 51:45.400\n So one of the things they loved about our camp\n\n51:45.400 --> 51:46.840\n was just that there were no books.\n\n51:46.840 --> 51:50.680\n Even though we gave them sheets of paper instead,\n\n51:50.680 --> 51:53.040\n they still felt more free\n\n51:53.040 --> 51:56.600\n because they weren't just like trotting through exercises,\n\n51:56.600 --> 51:59.520\n exercises, so.\n\n51:59.520 --> 52:02.720\n Like what a textbook allows you is like you're,\n\n52:03.760 --> 52:06.600\n the very thing you said they might not like,\n\n52:06.600 --> 52:11.080\n the 2.3, 2.3, it feels like you're making progress.\n\n52:11.080 --> 52:12.720\n And like it's little celebrations\n\n52:12.720 --> 52:16.160\n because you do the problem and it seems really hard\n\n52:16.160 --> 52:17.280\n and you don't know how to do it.\n\n52:17.280 --> 52:20.920\n And then you try and try and then eventually succeed.\n\n52:20.920 --> 52:23.600\n And then you make that little step and further progress.\n\n52:23.600 --> 52:26.120\n And then you get to the end of a chapter\n\n52:26.120 --> 52:28.000\n and you get to like, it's closure.\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:29.840\n You're like, all right, I got that figured out.\n\n52:29.840 --> 52:31.320\n And then you go on to the next chapter.\n\n52:31.320 --> 52:32.240\n I can see that.\n\n52:32.240 --> 52:34.880\n I mean, I think it could be in a textbook.\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:38.960\n You can have a good experience with a textbook,\n\n52:38.960 --> 52:43.160\n but what's really important is what is in that textbook?\n\n52:43.160 --> 52:45.280\n What are you doing inside it?\n\n52:45.280 --> 52:47.880\n And I mean, I grew up in England\n\n52:47.880 --> 52:50.440\n and in England we learn maths.\n\n52:50.440 --> 52:54.360\n We don't have this separation of algebra and geometry.\n\n52:54.360 --> 52:56.120\n And I don't think any other country\n\n52:56.120 --> 52:58.200\n apart from the US has that.\n\n52:58.200 --> 53:01.200\n But I look at kids in algebra classes\n\n53:01.200 --> 53:02.720\n where they're doing algebra for a year.\n\n53:02.720 --> 53:05.800\n And I think I would have been pretty bored doing that.\n\n53:05.800 --> 53:10.800\n By the way, can we analyze your upbringing real quick?\n\n53:13.040 --> 53:18.040\n Why do British folks call mathematics, maths?\n\n53:19.960 --> 53:21.120\n Why is it the plural?\n\n53:21.120 --> 53:23.120\n Is it because of everything you're saying\n\n53:23.120 --> 53:25.160\n where it's a bunch of subdisciplines?\n\n53:25.160 --> 53:29.800\n Yeah, I mean, mathematics is supposed to be\n\n53:29.800 --> 53:34.800\n the different maths that you look at,\n\n53:34.800 --> 53:38.040\n whether you think of that as topics\n\n53:38.040 --> 53:39.760\n like geometry and probability,\n\n53:39.760 --> 53:44.760\n or I think of it as maths is just multi dimensional\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:48.720\n lots of ways, but that's why it was called mathematics.\n\n53:48.720 --> 53:50.480\n And then it was shortened to maths.\n\n53:50.480 --> 53:53.360\n And then for some reason it was just math in the US.\n\n53:53.360 --> 53:58.360\n But to me, math has that more singular feel to it.\n\n53:58.440 --> 54:03.000\n And there's an expression here, which is do the math,\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.240\n which basically means do a calculation.\n\n54:05.240 --> 54:07.480\n That's what people mean by do the math.\n\n54:07.480 --> 54:09.360\n So I don't like that expression\n\n54:09.360 --> 54:11.240\n because no math could be anything\n\n54:11.240 --> 54:12.480\n doesn't have to be calculation.\n\n54:12.480 --> 54:14.600\n And so yeah, I like maths\n\n54:14.600 --> 54:17.280\n because it has more of that broad feel to it.\n\n54:17.280 --> 54:18.120\n Yeah, I love that.\n\n54:18.120 --> 54:20.000\n Maths kind of emphasize the multi dimensional,\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.880\n like a variety of different subdisciplines,\n\n54:22.880 --> 54:23.720\n different approaches.\n\n54:23.720 --> 54:25.320\n Yeah.\n\n54:25.320 --> 54:28.640\n Okay, but outside of the textbook,\n\n54:28.640 --> 54:33.640\n what do you see like broadly being used?\n\n54:33.640 --> 54:36.840\n You mentioned Sebastian Thrun and MOOCs,\n\n54:36.840 --> 54:37.880\n online education.\n\n54:37.880 --> 54:39.480\n Do you think that's an effective set?\n\n54:39.480 --> 54:40.960\n Can be.\n\n54:40.960 --> 54:45.080\n I mean, online, having great teachers online,\n\n54:45.080 --> 54:48.080\n obviously extends those teachers to many more people.\n\n54:48.080 --> 54:49.800\n And that's a wonderful thing.\n\n54:51.480 --> 54:54.280\n I have quite a few online courses myself.\n\n54:54.280 --> 54:56.240\n I got the bug working with Sebastian\n\n54:56.240 --> 54:59.720\n when he had released his first MOOC.\n\n54:59.720 --> 55:03.440\n And I thought, maybe I could do one in maths education.\n\n55:03.440 --> 55:05.520\n And I didn't know if anybody would take it.\n\n55:06.400 --> 55:08.400\n I remember releasing it that first summer\n\n55:08.400 --> 55:09.880\n and it was a free online class\n\n55:09.880 --> 55:13.760\n and 30,000 maths teachers took it that first summer.\n\n55:13.760 --> 55:16.000\n And they were all talking about it with each other\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\n and sharing it and it was like took off.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:23.000\n In fact, it was that MOOC that got me to create YouCubed\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:26.120\n with Kathy Williams, who's the co founder,\n\n55:26.120 --> 55:28.640\n because people took the MOOC and then they said,\n\n55:28.640 --> 55:30.680\n okay, what now?\n\n55:30.680 --> 55:33.440\n I finished, what can I have next?\n\n55:33.440 --> 55:35.400\n And so that was where we made our website.\n\n55:35.400 --> 55:39.120\n But so yeah, I think online education can be great.\n\n55:39.120 --> 55:43.960\n I do think a lot of the MOOCs don't have great pedagogy.\n\n55:43.960 --> 55:45.960\n They're just a talking head.\n\n55:45.960 --> 55:50.960\n And you can actually engage people in more active ways,\n\n55:50.960 --> 55:53.040\n even in online learning.\n\n55:53.040 --> 55:55.920\n So I learned from the Udacity principle\n\n55:55.920 --> 55:57.320\n when I was working at Udacity,\n\n55:57.320 --> 56:00.200\n never to talk more than like five minutes.\n\n56:00.200 --> 56:03.720\n And then to ask people to do something.\n\n56:03.720 --> 56:07.840\n So that's the sort of pedagogy of the online classes I have\n\n56:07.840 --> 56:10.520\n is a little bit of presenting something\n\n56:10.520 --> 56:13.200\n and then people do something and there's a little bit more.\n\n56:13.200 --> 56:15.280\n Because I think if you have a half hour video,\n\n56:15.280 --> 56:19.200\n you just switch off and start doing other things.\n\n56:19.200 --> 56:22.880\n So the way Udacity did it is like five, 10 minute,\n\n56:22.880 --> 56:27.880\n like bit of teaching with some visual stuff perhaps.\n\n56:27.880 --> 56:29.280\n And then there's like a quiz almost.\n\n56:29.280 --> 56:30.600\n Then you answer a question, yeah.\n\n56:30.600 --> 56:34.040\n Yeah, no, that's really effective.\n\n56:34.040 --> 56:36.120\n You mentioned Ucubed, so what's the mission?\n\n56:36.120 --> 56:36.960\n What's the goal?\n\n56:36.960 --> 56:41.440\n You mentioned how it started, but what's yeah,\n\n56:41.440 --> 56:42.840\n where are you at now?\n\n56:42.840 --> 56:44.680\n And what's your dream with it?\n\n56:44.680 --> 56:47.040\n What are the kind of things that people should go\n\n56:47.040 --> 56:47.880\n and check out?\n\n56:47.880 --> 56:51.560\n Yeah, we started Ucubed, I guess it was about five years\n\n56:51.560 --> 56:55.280\n ago now and we've had over 52 million visitors to the site.\n\n56:55.280 --> 56:57.400\n So I'm very happy about that.\n\n56:57.400 --> 57:01.760\n And our goal is to share good ideas for teaching\n\n57:01.760 --> 57:06.760\n with teachers, students, parents in maths and to help.\n\n57:07.280 --> 57:10.360\n We have a sort of sub goal of a raising maths anxiety.\n\n57:10.360 --> 57:13.240\n That's important to us, but also to share maths\n\n57:13.240 --> 57:15.880\n as this beautiful creative subject.\n\n57:15.880 --> 57:19.560\n And it's been really great.\n\n57:19.560 --> 57:23.560\n We have lessons on the site, but one of the reasons\n\n57:23.560 --> 57:26.720\n I thought this was needed is there's a lot of knowledge\n\n57:26.720 --> 57:29.120\n in the academy about how to teach maths well.\n\n57:29.120 --> 57:32.360\n Loads and loads of research and journals\n\n57:32.360 --> 57:36.360\n and lots of things written up, but teachers don't read it.\n\n57:36.360 --> 57:39.040\n They don't have access to it.\n\n57:39.040 --> 57:43.000\n They're often behind pay walls, they've written\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:46.440\n in really inaccessible ways.\n\n57:46.440 --> 57:49.240\n So people wouldn't want to read them or understand them.\n\n57:49.240 --> 57:51.120\n So this actually is a big problem.\n\n57:51.120 --> 57:54.200\n You have this whole industry of people finding out\n\n57:54.200 --> 57:57.360\n how to teach well, not sharing it with the people\n\n57:57.360 --> 57:58.760\n who are teaching.\n\n57:58.760 --> 58:01.360\n So that's why we made Ucubed.\n\n58:01.360 --> 58:03.640\n And instead of just putting articles up saying,\n\n58:03.640 --> 58:05.760\n here's some things to read about how to teach well,\n\n58:05.760 --> 58:08.200\n we translated what was coming from research\n\n58:08.200 --> 58:10.480\n into things that teacher could use.\n\n58:10.480 --> 58:13.560\n So lessons, there were videos to show kids\n\n58:13.560 --> 58:16.400\n and there were tips for parents.\n\n58:16.400 --> 58:17.960\n There were all sorts of things on the site.\n\n58:17.960 --> 58:20.600\n And it's been amazing.\n\n58:20.600 --> 58:24.840\n As we took inspiration from the week of code,\n\n58:24.840 --> 58:29.520\n which got teachers to focus on coding for a week.\n\n58:29.520 --> 58:31.840\n And we have this thing called the week\n\n58:31.840 --> 58:33.880\n of inspirational maths.\n\n58:33.880 --> 58:35.800\n And we say, just try it for a week.\n\n58:35.800 --> 58:39.360\n Just give us one week and try it and see what happens.\n\n58:39.360 --> 58:42.640\n And so it's been downloaded millions of times.\n\n58:42.640 --> 58:44.560\n Teachers use it every year.\n\n58:44.560 --> 58:46.520\n They start the school year with it.\n\n58:46.520 --> 58:49.640\n And what they tell us is it was amazing.\n\n58:49.640 --> 58:52.960\n The kids lights were on, they were excited, they loved it.\n\n58:52.960 --> 58:56.000\n And then the week finished and I opened my textbooks\n\n58:56.000 --> 59:00.000\n and the lights went out and they were not interested.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:04.160\n Yeah, but getting that first inspiration is still powerful.\n\n59:04.160 --> 59:07.680\n It is, I wish, I mean, what I would love\n\n59:07.680 --> 59:11.640\n is if we could actually extend that for the whole year.\n\n59:11.640 --> 59:13.960\n We're a small team at Stanford\n\n59:13.960 --> 59:17.000\n and we're trying to keep up with great things\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:18.240\n to put on the site.\n\n59:19.640 --> 59:22.480\n We haven't the capacity to produce\n\n59:22.480 --> 59:24.160\n these creative visual maths tasks\n\n59:24.160 --> 59:25.840\n for every year group for every day,\n\n59:25.840 --> 59:27.120\n but I would love to do that.\n\n59:27.120 --> 59:28.560\n How difficult is it to do?\n\n59:28.560 --> 59:33.560\n I mean, it's to come up with visual formulations\n\n59:33.560 --> 59:38.560\n of these big important topics you need to think about\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:43.320\n in a way that you could teach.\n\n59:43.320 --> 59:44.720\n I mean, we can do it.\n\n59:44.720 --> 59:47.400\n We actually, we went from the week of inspirational maths\n\n59:47.400 --> 59:51.920\n and we made K8 maths books with exactly that.\n\n59:51.920 --> 59:54.880\n Big ideas, rich activities, visuals.\n\n59:54.880 --> 59:56.520\n We just finished the last one.\n\n59:56.520 --> 59:58.920\n We've been doing it for five years\n\n59:58.920 --> 1:00:01.600\n and it's been exhausting and we just finished.\n\n1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:05.560\n So now there's a whole K8 set of books\n\n1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.120\n and they're organized in that way.\n\n1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:08.320\n These are the big ideas.\n\n1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:10.240\n Here are rich, deep activities.\n\n1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:16.040\n They're not though what you can do every day for a year.\n\n1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:19.040\n So some teachers use them as a kind of supplement\n\n1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:21.000\n to their boring textbook.\n\n1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.360\n And some people have said, okay, this is the year.\n\n1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:26.440\n This book tells us what the year is\n\n1:00:26.440 --> 1:00:29.120\n and then we'll supplement these big activities with.\n\n1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:34.120\n So they're being used and teachers really like them\n\n1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:36.160\n and are really happy about them.\n\n1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:37.440\n I just always want more.\n\n1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:40.200\n And I guess one of the things I would like for YouCubed,\n\n1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:43.600\n one of my personal goals is that every teacher of maths\n\n1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:45.400\n knows about YouCubed.\n\n1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:48.440\n At the moment, lots of teachers who come to us\n\n1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:49.760\n are really happy they found it\n\n1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:51.200\n but there's a lot of other teachers\n\n1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:53.520\n who don't know that it exists.\n\n1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:54.920\n I hope this helps.\n\n1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:55.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:55.960 --> 1:00:59.440\n From a student perspective and not in the classroom\n\n1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:01.520\n but at home studying,\n\n1:01:03.800 --> 1:01:07.360\n is there some advice you can give\n\n1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:09.760\n on how to best study mathematics?\n\n1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:12.600\n So what's the role of the student outside the classroom?\n\n1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:17.520\n Yeah, I think one thing we know is a lot of people\n\n1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:19.680\n when they review material,\n\n1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:21.320\n whether it's maths or anything else,\n\n1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:23.640\n don't do it in the best way.\n\n1:01:23.640 --> 1:01:25.800\n I think a problem a lot of people have\n\n1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:28.920\n is they read through maybe a teacher's explanation\n\n1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:32.800\n or a way of doing maths and it makes sense.\n\n1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:33.840\n And they think, oh yeah, I've got that.\n\n1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:35.000\n And they move on.\n\n1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:38.840\n But then it's not until you come to try\n\n1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:40.520\n and work on something and do a problem\n\n1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:42.520\n that you actually realize you didn't really understand it,\n\n1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:43.880\n just seemed to make sense.\n\n1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:47.280\n So I would say,\n\n1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.600\n this is also something that neuroscientists talk about,\n\n1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:53.400\n to keep giving yourself questions\n\n1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:56.560\n is a really good way to study.\n\n1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:59.320\n Rather than looking through lots of material,\n\n1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:02.480\n it's always like giving yourself lots of tests\n\n1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:05.360\n is a good way to actually deeply understand things\n\n1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:07.560\n and know what you do and you don't understand.\n\n1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:11.320\n So would the questions be in the form of\n\n1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:12.960\n the material you're reviewing\n\n1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:14.440\n is the answer to that question?\n\n1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.040\n Or is it almost like beyond,\n\n1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:18.880\n it's the polygon thing they mentioned for a square.\n\n1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:22.760\n Is it almost like, I wonder what is the bigger picture?\n\n1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:26.200\n I was kind of asking like, how is this extended and so on?\n\n1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:28.680\n Yeah, that would be great.\n\n1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:30.200\n And it's a similar,\n\n1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:32.480\n I mean, a question I get asked a lot is about homework.\n\n1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:34.960\n What is a good thing for kids to do for homework?\n\n1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:36.960\n And one of the recommendations I give\n\n1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:41.960\n is to not have kids just do lots of questions for homework,\n\n1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:46.080\n but to actually ask them to reflect on what they've learned.\n\n1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:49.680\n Like, what was the big idea you learned today?\n\n1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:51.880\n Or what did you find difficult?\n\n1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:53.480\n What did you struggle with?\n\n1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:56.480\n What was something that was exciting?\n\n1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:01.120\n Then kids go home and they have to kind of reflect\n\n1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:02.440\n in a deeper way.\n\n1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:04.520\n A lot of times, I don't know if you had this experience\n\n1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:06.640\n as a math student, lots of people do.\n\n1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:08.800\n Kids are going through math questions,\n\n1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:10.920\n they're successful, they get them right,\n\n1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:13.960\n but they don't even really know what they're about.\n\n1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:17.160\n And a lot of kids go through many years of maths like that,\n\n1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:18.200\n doing lots of questions,\n\n1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:21.960\n but that really knowing what even the topic is\n\n1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:24.400\n or what it's about, what it's important for.\n\n1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:28.760\n So having students go back and think at the end of a day,\n\n1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:31.640\n what was the big idea from this maths lesson?\n\n1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:33.320\n Why is it important?\n\n1:03:33.320 --> 1:03:36.040\n Where would I find that in real life?\n\n1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.920\n Those are really good questions\n\n1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:39.920\n for kids to be thinking about.\n\n1:03:39.920 --> 1:03:42.400\n It's probably for everybody to be thinking about.\n\n1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:44.320\n I think most of us go through life\n\n1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:48.160\n never asking the bigger question,\n\n1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:51.600\n always those layers of why questions\n\n1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:54.160\n that kids ask when they're very young.\n\n1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:55.960\n We need to keep doing that.\n\n1:03:55.960 --> 1:03:59.680\n Like whatever the term is,\n\n1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:01.400\n you call first principles thinking,\n\n1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:03.320\n some people call it that,\n\n1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:08.320\n which is like, why are we doing it this way?\n\n1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:11.760\n So one nice thing is to do that\n\n1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:13.360\n because there's usually a good answer.\n\n1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:15.360\n The reason we did it this way\n\n1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:17.760\n is because it works for this reason.\n\n1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:20.960\n But then if you want to do something totally novel,\n\n1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:24.200\n you'll say, well, we've been doing it this way\n\n1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:28.600\n because of historical reasons,\n\n1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:30.520\n but really this is not the best way to do it.\n\n1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:32.240\n There might be other ways.\n\n1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:34.440\n And that's how invention happens.\n\n1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:36.480\n And then you get, that's really useful\n\n1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:40.440\n in every aspect of life, like choosing your career,\n\n1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:44.800\n choosing your, I don't know, where you live,\n\n1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:47.760\n who your romantic partner is, like everything.\n\n1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.960\n Everything, yeah.\n\n1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:53.200\n And I think it probably starts doing that in math class.\n\n1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:56.280\n That would be good if we started doing that.\n\n1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:00.960\n I mean, I wonder, I probably didn't do very much of that\n\n1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:03.760\n for most of my education, asking why,\n\n1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:08.160\n except for later, much later in the subjects\n\n1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:12.240\n on grad school when you're doing research on them.\n\n1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:15.080\n When you're first tasked with doing something novel\n\n1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:18.040\n using this or solving a problem\n\n1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:19.960\n really outside the classroom,\n\n1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:20.800\n they have to publish on it.\n\n1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:22.560\n It's the first time you think,\n\n1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:27.040\n wait, why are these things interesting, useful?\n\n1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:29.440\n Which are the things that are useful?\n\n1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:31.680\n And yeah, I guess that would be nice\n\n1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:35.240\n if we did that much earlier, the quest of invention.\n\n1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:39.680\n Yeah, yeah, I mean, one of the sad pieces of research data\n\n1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:44.680\n I think about is the questions kids ask in school goes down\n\n1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:50.800\n like in a linear progression from, in the early years,\n\n1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:53.800\n you can't stop kids asking those questions,\n\n1:05:53.800 --> 1:05:56.720\n but they learn not to ask the questions.\n\n1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:00.000\n I think you told somewhere about an early memory\n\n1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:04.680\n you had in your own education where you asked the question,\n\n1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:06.280\n or maybe that was an example you gave,\n\n1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:07.440\n but it was shut down.\n\n1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:08.920\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:06:08.920 --> 1:06:11.080\n You've listened to something I said, yeah.\n\n1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:15.200\n I don't remember where it was, but it caught me.\n\n1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:17.680\n Yeah, I remember it really vividly.\n\n1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:19.840\n Or can you tell the memory?\n\n1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:21.800\n Yeah, I was, it's funny, I can remember.\n\n1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:23.960\n It must've really impacted me in that moment\n\n1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:26.320\n because you know how there's lots of hours of school\n\n1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:29.040\n you don't remember at all, but anyway,\n\n1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:30.720\n I can remember where I was sitting and everything.\n\n1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:33.360\n I was in a high school maths class,\n\n1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:35.280\n although they don't call it that in England,\n\n1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:39.040\n and the teacher said,\n\n1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:41.960\n and it was like the first class of this teacher's class,\n\n1:06:41.960 --> 1:06:44.360\n and he said, ask if you have any questions.\n\n1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:46.840\n So at one point I put my hand up and I said,\n\n1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:49.240\n I have a question, and he said something like,\n\n1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:50.480\n that's your question?\n\n1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:55.400\n And I was like, oh, okay,\n\n1:06:55.400 --> 1:06:57.400\n I'm not asking any more questions in this class.\n\n1:06:57.400 --> 1:06:59.960\n And that hit hard in a way where you didn't wanna,\n\n1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:02.040\n the lesson you learn from that is I'm not gonna ask.\n\n1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:06.320\n Yeah, that was absolutely the last question I'm asking.\n\n1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:11.320\n And that was, yeah, he was the chair of the maths department.\n\n1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:13.720\n I remember that really well.\n\n1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:18.080\n So maybe because of that experience,\n\n1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:20.400\n one of the things we encourage when we teach kids\n\n1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:23.040\n is asking questions, and we value it when they ask questions\n\n1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:25.720\n and we put them up on walls and celebrate.\n\n1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.400\n It's funny because I wish there was a feedback signal\n\n1:07:31.400 --> 1:07:35.040\n because he probably, to put a positive spin on it,\n\n1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:37.440\n he probably didn't realize the negative impact\n\n1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:38.720\n he's had in that moment, right?\n\n1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:41.160\n If he only knew, see, this is probably\n\n1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:44.120\n when you're more mature in grad school.\n\n1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:46.960\n I had an amazing professor named Ali Shakafande\n\n1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:49.960\n in computer science, and he would get,\n\n1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:51.240\n he would encourage questions,\n\n1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:52.440\n but then he would tell everybody\n\n1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:54.280\n how dumb their questions are.\n\n1:07:54.280 --> 1:07:57.360\n But it was done, I guess if you show,\n\n1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:00.760\n if you say it with love and respect behind it,\n\n1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:03.720\n then it's more like a friendly, humorous encouragement\n\n1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:05.080\n for more questions.\n\n1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:07.880\n Yeah, it's an art, right, to do it, to write.\n\n1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:10.200\n And then you have to time it right\n\n1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:13.080\n because that kind of humor is probably better\n\n1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.440\n for when you're in grad school\n\n1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:18.000\n versus when you're in the early education.\n\n1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:18.840\n Right.\n\n1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:22.320\n Well, and I guess kids or young people get\n\n1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:27.320\n whether somebody's doing it to be funny or, you know,\n\n1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:31.160\n I mean, this is why teaching is so hard.\n\n1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:35.120\n Even your tone can be impactful.\n\n1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:39.680\n It's so sad because for that particular human,\n\n1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.760\n the teacher, you just had a bad day,\n\n1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:45.920\n and one statement can have a profound negative impact.\n\n1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:50.120\n I know, sadly, that there's a lot of maths teachers\n\n1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:51.960\n who have that kind of approach,\n\n1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:56.000\n and I think they're suffering from the fact\n\n1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.200\n that they think people are math people, not math people,\n\n1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:01.040\n and that comes across in their teaching.\n\n1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:03.400\n But on the flip side, one positive statement.\n\n1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:04.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:05.080\n Keep them going.\n\n1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:05.920\n That's right.\n\n1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.240\n That is the flip side of that.\n\n1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:11.320\n And I myself had one teacher who was really amazing\n\n1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:14.840\n for me in maths, and she kept me in the subject.\n\n1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:16.320\n I probably wouldn't have left it.\n\n1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:17.160\n Who was she?\n\n1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:20.840\n She was, her name was Mrs. Marshall.\n\n1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:25.840\n And she was my A level maths teacher.\n\n1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:30.080\n So I was in England.\n\n1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.040\n You do lots of subjects till you're 16,\n\n1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:35.320\n and then you choose like three or four subjects.\n\n1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:40.320\n So I had chosen maths, and you go to higher levels,\n\n1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:44.640\n probably equivalent more to a master's degree in the US\n\n1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.160\n because you're more specialized.\n\n1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:48.720\n But anyways, she was my teacher,\n\n1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:52.680\n and for the first time in my whole career in maths,\n\n1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:54.320\n she would give us problems\n\n1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:58.000\n and tell us to talk about them with each other.\n\n1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000\n And so here I was sitting there at like 17,\n\n1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.000\n talking with friends about how to solve a math problem,\n\n1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:04.840\n and that was it.\n\n1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:07.800\n That was the change that she made,\n\n1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:10.000\n but it was profound for me\n\n1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:13.360\n because like those calculus students,\n\n1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:16.200\n I started to hear other people's ways of thinking\n\n1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:17.920\n and seeing it, and we would talk together\n\n1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:19.840\n and come up with solutions.\n\n1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:20.680\n And I was like, that was it.\n\n1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:22.040\n That changed maths for me.\n\n1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:25.520\n It wasn't some kind of personal interaction with her.\n\n1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:29.200\n It was more like she was the catalyst\n\n1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:32.040\n for that collaborative experience.\n\n1:10:32.040 --> 1:10:34.960\n I mean, yeah, the many ways teachers can inspire kids.\n\n1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:36.920\n I mean, sometimes it's a personal message,\n\n1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:39.840\n but it can be your teaching approach\n\n1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:42.400\n that changes maths for kids.\n\n1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:47.400\n You know, Cal Newport, he wrote a book called Deep Work,\n\n1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:51.480\n and he's a mathematician, a theoretical computer scientist,\n\n1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:55.720\n and he talks about the kind of the focus required\n\n1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:57.120\n to do that kind of work.\n\n1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:01.760\n Is there something you can comment on?\n\n1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:04.920\n You know, we live in a world full of distractions.\n\n1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:08.400\n That seems like one of the elements that makes studying,\n\n1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:10.280\n and especially the studying of subjects\n\n1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:14.480\n that require thinking like maths does, difficult.\n\n1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:17.400\n Is there something from a student perspective,\n\n1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:20.640\n from a teacher perspective that encourages deep work\n\n1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:21.480\n that you can comment on?\n\n1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:26.480\n Yeah, I think giving kids really inspiring deep problems,\n\n1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.440\n and we have some on our website,\n\n1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:33.920\n is a really important experience for them.\n\n1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:38.200\n Even if they only do it occasionally,\n\n1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:40.080\n but it's really important.\n\n1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:44.360\n They actually realise, I do, I give a problem out often\n\n1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:47.040\n when I'm working with teachers, and I say to them,\n\n1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:49.800\n all right, I'm gonna check in with you after an hour.\n\n1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:51.480\n And they're like, an hour?\n\n1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:53.520\n They think it's shocking.\n\n1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:55.400\n And then they work on this problem,\n\n1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:57.880\n and after an hour, I say, okay, how are we doing?\n\n1:11:57.880 --> 1:11:59.520\n They're like, an hour's gone by?\n\n1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:02.000\n How is this possible?\n\n1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:07.000\n And so everybody needs those like rich deep problems.\n\n1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.680\n Most kids go through their whole maths experience\n\n1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:14.880\n of however many years, never once working on a problem\n\n1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:16.680\n in that kind of deep way.\n\n1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:21.680\n So the undergrad class I teach at Stanford, we do that.\n\n1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.160\n We work on these deep problems every session.\n\n1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:27.200\n And the students come away going, okay,\n\n1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:30.120\n I never wanna go back to that maths relationship I had\n\n1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:32.000\n where it was just all about quick answers.\n\n1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.520\n I just don't wanna go back to that.\n\n1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:39.520\n And so we can all, all teachers can incorporate\n\n1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:41.280\n those problems in their classrooms.\n\n1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:42.560\n Maybe they don't do them every day,\n\n1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:46.080\n but they at least give kids some experience\n\n1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:49.760\n of being able to work slowly and deeply\n\n1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:54.760\n and to go to deeper places and not be told\n\n1:12:55.680 --> 1:12:58.680\n they've got five minutes to finish 20 questions.\n\n1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:02.720\n Well, part of it is also just the exercise\n\n1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:05.320\n of sitting there and maintaining focus\n\n1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:07.040\n for prolonged periods of time.\n\n1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:11.960\n That's not often, I mean, that's a skill.\n\n1:13:11.960 --> 1:13:16.000\n It's a skill that also could be discouraging.\n\n1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.120\n Like if you don't practice it,\n\n1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:20.520\n just sitting down for 10 minutes straight\n\n1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:23.480\n and maintaining deep focus could be exceptionally challenging.\n\n1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:26.600\n Like if you're really thinking about a problem\n\n1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:29.240\n and I think it's really important to realize\n\n1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:31.880\n that that's a skill that you can just like a muscle,\n\n1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:33.520\n you can build, you can start with five minutes\n\n1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:36.680\n and goes to 10 minutes to 30 and to an hour.\n\n1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:39.000\n And to be successful, I think in certain subjects\n\n1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.520\n like mathematics, you wanna be able to develop that skill.\n\n1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:46.640\n Otherwise you're not going to get\n\n1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:49.680\n to the really rewarding experience\n\n1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:51.320\n of solving these problems.\n\n1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:53.520\n Definitely.\n\n1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:55.880\n There was a survey done of kids in school\n\n1:13:55.880 --> 1:13:57.480\n where they were asked, how long will you work\n\n1:13:57.480 --> 1:13:59.000\n on a maths problem before you give up\n\n1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.440\n and decide it's not possible to solve it?\n\n1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:06.720\n And the result on average across the kids was two minutes.\n\n1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:15.360\n Yeah, that's a bad sign, but that was a powerful sign\n\n1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:19.480\n that they need to learn to not give up so quickly.\n\n1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:22.760\n Yeah, we mentioned offline\n\n1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:25.520\n because we've been talking so much about visualization,\n\n1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:29.200\n Grant Sanderson, Three Blue One Brown.\n\n1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:32.040\n So he's inspired millions of people\n\n1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:35.480\n with exactly the kind of way of thinking\n\n1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:36.640\n that you've been talking about.\n\n1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:38.960\n Yeah, I love his work.\n\n1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:42.680\n Converting sort of mathematical concepts\n\n1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:47.680\n into visual, like visually representing them,\n\n1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:51.000\n exploring them in ways that help you illuminate\n\n1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.160\n like the concepts.\n\n1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.040\n What do you think is the role of that?\n\n1:14:55.040 --> 1:14:58.000\n So he uses mostly programmatic visualization.\n\n1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:01.320\n So it's the thing I mentioned where there's like animations\n\n1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:04.520\n created by writing computer programs.\n\n1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:08.440\n Like what do you think, how scalable is that approach?\n\n1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:10.480\n But in general, what do you think about his approach?\n\n1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:11.880\n I think it's amazing.\n\n1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:13.200\n I should work with him.\n\n1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:17.040\n I can share some of our visuals\n\n1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:19.600\n and he can make them in that amazing way.\n\n1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:23.040\n So part of his storytelling,\n\n1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:26.360\n part of it is creating the visuals\n\n1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:29.400\n and then weaving a story with those visuals\n\n1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:32.080\n that kind of builds, like there's also,\n\n1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:34.960\n I mean, there's also drama in it.\n\n1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.520\n You start with a small example\n\n1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:39.560\n and then you kind of, all of a sudden there's a surprise.\n\n1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.080\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:43.440\n And it really, I mean, it makes you fall in love\n\n1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:45.560\n with the concept.\n\n1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.040\n He does talk about that.\n\n1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:50.800\n His sense is like some of the stuff,\n\n1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:55.800\n he doesn't feel like he's teaching like the core curriculum,\n\n1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:01.000\n which is something, he sees himself\n\n1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.600\n as an inspirational figure.\n\n1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:05.760\n But because I think it's too difficult\n\n1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:09.600\n to kind of convert all of the curriculum into those elements.\n\n1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:11.000\n And probably you don't need to.\n\n1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:15.920\n I mean, if people get to experience mathematical ideas\n\n1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:20.000\n in the way that he shares them, that will change them.\n\n1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:21.600\n And it will change the way they think.\n\n1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:22.840\n And maybe they could go on\n\n1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:25.040\n to take some other mathematical idea\n\n1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:26.320\n and make it that beautiful.\n\n1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:27.320\n Well, he does that.\n\n1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:32.920\n He created a library called Manim and he open sourced it.\n\n1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:36.400\n And that library is the, people should check it out.\n\n1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.520\n It's written in Python\n\n1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.960\n and it uses some of those same elements.\n\n1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:44.040\n Like it allows you to animate equations\n\n1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:45.640\n and animate little shapes.\n\n1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:47.600\n Like people that, you know,\n\n1:16:47.600 --> 1:16:50.320\n he has a very distinct style in his videos\n\n1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:51.640\n and what that resulted in,\n\n1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:54.160\n even though from a software engineer perspective,\n\n1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:57.760\n the code he released is not like super well documented\n\n1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.440\n or perfect, but him releasing that,\n\n1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:05.200\n now there's all of these people educating it.\n\n1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:06.800\n And the cool, to me personally,\n\n1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:11.120\n the coolest thing is to see like people they're not,\n\n1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:13.760\n you know, don't have like a million subscribers\n\n1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:17.440\n or something is they have just a few views in the video,\n\n1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:21.520\n but it just seems like the process of them\n\n1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:24.360\n creating a video where they teach\n\n1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:27.200\n is like transformative to them from a student perspective.\n\n1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:28.360\n It's the old Feynman thing,\n\n1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:30.280\n the best way to learn is to teach.\n\n1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:32.680\n And then him releasing that into the wild is,\n\n1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:35.800\n it shows that that impact.\n\n1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:37.480\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:39.840\n I think just giving people that idea\n\n1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:42.920\n that you can do that with maths and other subjects,\n\n1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:45.680\n there's bound to be people all around\n\n1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:48.720\n who can create more, which is cool.\n\n1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:49.640\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:52.600\n So I recommend that people do like JavaScript or Python.\n\n1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:56.400\n You can build like visualizations of most concepts\n\n1:17:56.400 --> 1:17:57.720\n in high school math.\n\n1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.000\n You can do a lot of kinds of visualizations\n\n1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.480\n and doing that yourself.\n\n1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:04.360\n Plus, if you do that yourself, people will really love it.\n\n1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:09.240\n People actually, people love visualizations of math.\n\n1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:11.160\n Cause they, I mean, it's something in us\n\n1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:14.280\n that loves patterns, loves figuring out difficult things\n\n1:18:14.280 --> 1:18:19.000\n and the patterns in there then are unexpected in some way.\n\n1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:19.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:22.040\n Have you ever noticed that hotels\n\n1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:24.240\n are always filled with patterns?\n\n1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:26.360\n I was just noticing at the hotel I'm in now,\n\n1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:28.720\n all of their carpets are pattern carpets\n\n1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:30.920\n and then they have patterns on the walls.\n\n1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:31.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:33.080\n So, yeah.\n\n1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:36.440\n We humans love the symmetry and patterns,\n\n1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:38.840\n the breaking of symmetry and patterns.\n\n1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:39.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:42.880\n And then it's funny that we don't see mathematics\n\n1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:45.960\n as somehow intricately connected to that, but it is, right?\n\n1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:47.360\n I mean, that's one of the perspectives\n\n1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:51.040\n that I love students to take is to be a pattern seeker.\n\n1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:51.880\n In everything.\n\n1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:53.840\n In, yeah, certainly in all of maths.\n\n1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:55.320\n I mean, you can think of all of maths\n\n1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:57.160\n as a kind of subject of patterns\n\n1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:01.600\n and not just visual patterns, but, you know,\n\n1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:05.720\n when you think about multiplying by five\n\n1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:08.120\n and the fact you can, you know,\n\n1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:11.280\n if you're multiplying 18 times five,\n\n1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:13.800\n you can instead think of nine times 10.\n\n1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:17.240\n That's a pattern that always works in mathematics.\n\n1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:19.080\n You can halve a number and double a number.\n\n1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:21.320\n And so, yeah, I just think there are patterns everywhere.\n\n1:19:21.320 --> 1:19:24.760\n And if kids are thinking their role is to see patterns\n\n1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:28.440\n and find patterns, it's really exciting.\n\n1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:31.960\n What do you think about like MIT OpenCourseWare\n\n1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:36.280\n and the release of lectures by universities?\n\n1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:37.880\n I think it's good.\n\n1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:38.720\n I think it's good.\n\n1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:43.720\n I think that is what started the MOOC I did\n\n1:19:43.800 --> 1:19:46.040\n was using that platform.\n\n1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:48.720\n So you ultimately think like the Udacity models\n\n1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:50.440\n is a little bit more effective\n\n1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.440\n than just a plain two hour lecture.\n\n1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:53.600\n I think there's definitely,\n\n1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:57.000\n you can bring in good pedagogy into online learning.\n\n1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.560\n And I think the idea of putting things online\n\n1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:02.720\n so that people all over the world can access them is great.\n\n1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:06.000\n I don't think the initial excitement around MOOCs\n\n1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:08.280\n sort of democratizing education\n\n1:20:08.280 --> 1:20:11.840\n and make it more equal came about\n\n1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:14.040\n because they found that the people taking MOOCs\n\n1:20:14.040 --> 1:20:17.000\n tended to be the more privileged people.\n\n1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:20.880\n So that was, I think there's still something to be found\n\n1:20:20.880 --> 1:20:22.800\n in that there's still more to be done\n\n1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:27.640\n to help that online learning reach those principles.\n\n1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:31.800\n But definitely, I think it's a good invention.\n\n1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:35.080\n And I have an online class that's for kids,\n\n1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:36.960\n that's a little free class that gives them.\n\n1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:37.960\n What's the topic?\n\n1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:39.480\n It's called How to Learn Maths.\n\n1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:41.680\n How to Learn Maths.\n\n1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:44.360\n It shows maths as this visual creative subject\n\n1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:47.080\n and it shares mindset and some brain science\n\n1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:51.200\n and kids who take it do better in maths class.\n\n1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:54.160\n We've studied it with like randomized controlled trials\n\n1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:57.240\n and given it to middle school kids\n\n1:20:57.240 --> 1:21:00.000\n and other middle school kids who don't take it\n\n1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:01.320\n but are taught by the same teachers.\n\n1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:02.920\n So their teachers are the same.\n\n1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:04.840\n And the kids who take the online class\n\n1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:08.680\n end up 68% more engaged in their maths class\n\n1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:10.480\n and do better at the end of the year.\n\n1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:15.080\n So that's a little six session, 15 minute class\n\n1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:18.920\n and it changes kids maths relationships.\n\n1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:23.920\n So it is true that we can do that with some words\n\n1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:29.440\n that aren't, it's not a huge change to the education system.\n\n1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:33.120\n Do you have advice for young people?\n\n1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:35.920\n We've been talking about mathematics quite a bit\n\n1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:39.200\n but in terms of their journey through education,\n\n1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:41.760\n through their career choices, through life,\n\n1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:46.040\n maybe middle school, high school, undergrad students,\n\n1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:48.680\n of how to live a life they can be proud of?\n\n1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:54.160\n I think if I were to give advice to people,\n\n1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:59.160\n especially young people, my advice would be to always,\n\n1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:00.440\n it sounds really corny,\n\n1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:03.360\n but always believe in yourself\n\n1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:05.240\n and know that you can achieve\n\n1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:07.880\n because although that sounds like obvious,\n\n1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:10.320\n of course we want kids to know that they can achieve things.\n\n1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:13.760\n I know that millions of kids who are in the school system\n\n1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:17.160\n have been given the message, they cannot do things.\n\n1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:20.520\n And adults too, they have the idea,\n\n1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:23.200\n oh, I did okay in this, I went into this job\n\n1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:26.840\n because those other things I could never have done okay in.\n\n1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:28.480\n So actually when they hear,\n\n1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:31.440\n hey, maybe you could do those other things.\n\n1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:34.960\n Even adults think, maybe I can.\n\n1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:38.000\n And they go back and they encounter this knowledge\n\n1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.680\n and they relearn things and they change careers\n\n1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:42.560\n and amazing things happen.\n\n1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:45.840\n So for me, I think that message is really important.\n\n1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:47.680\n You can learn anything.\n\n1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:50.040\n Scientists try and find a limit.\n\n1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:51.120\n They're always trying to find a limit,\n\n1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:52.400\n like how much can you really learn?\n\n1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:54.160\n What's the limit to how much you can learn?\n\n1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:56.400\n And they always come away not being able to find it.\n\n1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:59.400\n People can just go further and further and further.\n\n1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:03.000\n And that is true of people born with brain,\n\n1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:06.280\n areas of their brain that aren't functioning well\n\n1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:08.640\n that have what we call special needs.\n\n1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:10.880\n Some of those people also go on to develop\n\n1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:12.680\n and do amazing things.\n\n1:23:12.680 --> 1:23:17.280\n So I think that really experiencing that,\n\n1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:19.440\n knowing that feeling, not just saying it,\n\n1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:24.080\n but knowing it deeply, you can learn anything\n\n1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:28.600\n is something I wish all people would have.\n\n1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:30.600\n Actually also applies when you've achieved\n\n1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:32.400\n some level of success too.\n\n1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:36.240\n What I find, like in my life with people that love me,\n\n1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:37.840\n when you achieve success,\n\n1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:40.280\n they keep celebrating your success\n\n1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:42.640\n and they want you to keep doing the thing\n\n1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:44.960\n that you were successful at,\n\n1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:49.080\n as opposed to believing in that you can do something else,\n\n1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:51.560\n something big, whatever your heart says to do.\n\n1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:54.880\n And one of the things that I realized the value of this,\n\n1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:00.400\n quite recently, which is sad to say,\n\n1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:03.160\n is how important it is to seek out,\n\n1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:04.920\n when you're younger, to seek out mentors,\n\n1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:07.520\n to seek out the people,\n\n1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:10.680\n surround yourself with people that will believe in you.\n\n1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:14.040\n It's like a little bit is on you.\n\n1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:18.200\n It's like, you don't get that sometimes\n\n1:24:18.200 --> 1:24:20.080\n if you go to grad school,\n\n1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:22.240\n you think you kind of land on a mentor,\n\n1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:24.440\n maybe you pick a mentor based on the topic\n\n1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:25.680\n they're interested in.\n\n1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:28.960\n But the reality is the people you surround yourself with,\n\n1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:32.400\n they're going to define your life trajectory.\n\n1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:35.480\n So select people that believe in you.\n\n1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:38.640\n And get away from people who don't believe in you.\n\n1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:41.840\n Sometimes parents can be that, they can love you deeply,\n\n1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:46.280\n but they set, it's the math thing we mentioned,\n\n1:24:46.280 --> 1:24:50.120\n they might set certain constraints on the beliefs\n\n1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:50.960\n that you have.\n\n1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:55.080\n And so in that, if you're interested in mathematics,\n\n1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:56.800\n and your parents are not that interested in it,\n\n1:24:56.800 --> 1:24:59.600\n don't listen to your parents on that one dimension.\n\n1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:00.800\n Exactly.\n\n1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:02.880\n Yeah, and if people tell you you can't do things,\n\n1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:06.640\n you have to hear from other people who believe in you.\n\n1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:09.200\n I think you're absolutely right about that.\n\n1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:11.280\n So sad the number of people who've had\n\n1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:14.040\n those negative messages from parents.\n\n1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.840\n In my Limitless Mind book, I interviewed quite a few people\n\n1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:18.520\n who'd been told they couldn't do math,\n\n1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:21.720\n sometimes by parents, sometimes by teachers.\n\n1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:24.880\n And fortunately, they had got other ideas\n\n1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:26.040\n at some point in their life,\n\n1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:28.520\n and realized there was this whole world\n\n1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:32.240\n of mathematical thinking that was open to them.\n\n1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.240\n So it's really important that people do connect\n\n1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:39.120\n with people who believe in them,\n\n1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:41.920\n however hard that might be to find those people.\n\n1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:44.880\n What do you hope the education system,\n\n1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:48.000\n education in general, looks like 10, 20, 50,\n\n1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.640\n 100 years from now?\n\n1:25:49.640 --> 1:25:51.720\n Are you optimistic about this future?\n\n1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:53.080\n Yeah, I definitely have hope.\n\n1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:56.600\n There is, change can happen in the education system.\n\n1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:00.600\n In recent years, it's been microscopically slow.\n\n1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:07.320\n But I do actually see change happening.\n\n1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:10.840\n We were talking earlier that data science is now\n\n1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:14.280\n a course you can take in high school instead of algebra two.\n\n1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.640\n And that's pretty amazing because that content\n\n1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:22.080\n was set out in 1892 and hasn't changed since then.\n\n1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:25.120\n And so now we're actually seeing a change\n\n1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:26.880\n in the content of high school.\n\n1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:29.480\n So I'm amazed that that's happening\n\n1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:31.280\n and very happy it's happening.\n\n1:26:31.280 --> 1:26:33.960\n So change is very slow in education usually,\n\n1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:38.960\n but when you look ahead and think about all that we know,\n\n1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:42.960\n and all that we can offer kids in terms of technology,\n\n1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:46.960\n you've got to think that 100 years from now,\n\n1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:50.960\n education will be totally different to the way it is now.\n\n1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:54.400\n Maybe we won't have subject boundaries anymore\n\n1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:57.400\n because those don't really make much sense.\n\n1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:00.880\n And it's interesting to think how certain tools\n\n1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:03.960\n like programming, maybe they'll be deeply integrated\n\n1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:04.800\n in everything we do.\n\n1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:07.360\n Yeah, you would think that all kids are growing up\n\n1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:11.040\n learning to program and create.\n\n1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:14.360\n So I just think, I mean, the system of schooling\n\n1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:17.240\n we have now, people call it a factory model.\n\n1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:21.960\n It's not designed to inspire creativity.\n\n1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:25.560\n And I feel like that will also change.\n\n1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:27.360\n People might look back on these days\n\n1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:28.800\n and think they were hilarious,\n\n1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:32.200\n but maybe we'll in the future,\n\n1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:33.600\n kids will be doing their own programming\n\n1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:35.080\n and they'll be able to learn things\n\n1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:37.120\n and find out things and create things\n\n1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:37.960\n even as they're learning.\n\n1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:42.960\n And maybe the individual subject boundaries will go.\n\n1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:47.360\n Data science itself coming into the education system\n\n1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:50.440\n kind of illustrates that because people realize\n\n1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:54.960\n it doesn't really fit inside any of the subjects.\n\n1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:56.280\n So what do we do with it?\n\n1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:59.840\n Where does it go and who teaches it?\n\n1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:03.080\n So it's already raising those kind of questions\n\n1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:07.560\n and questioning how we have these different subject boundaries.\n\n1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:09.320\n So you've seen data science be integrated\n\n1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:10.640\n into the curriculum?\n\n1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:14.080\n Yes, it's happening across the United States as we speak.\n\n1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:15.480\n I wonder how they got initiated.\n\n1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:18.360\n Like how does change happen in the education system?\n\n1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.880\n Is it just a few revolutionary leaders?\n\n1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:22.320\n It does, I think so.\n\n1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:23.160\n I think so.\n\n1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:24.520\n It's been an interesting journey\n\n1:28:24.520 --> 1:28:26.600\n seeing data science take off actually.\n\n1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:31.600\n There was a course that was developed in 2014\n\n1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:34.240\n by some people who thought data science\n\n1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:36.640\n was a good idea for high schoolers.\n\n1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:39.480\n And then after some kids took the course\n\n1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:41.320\n and nothing bad happened to them,\n\n1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:46.320\n they went to college and people started to accept it more.\n\n1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:49.480\n And then this was a big piece of the change in California.\n\n1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:52.040\n The UC system communicated.\n\n1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:53.600\n They sent out an email last year,\n\n1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:57.080\n the 50,000 high schools saying, we now accept data science.\n\n1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.120\n Kids can take it instead of algebra two.\n\n1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:01.960\n That's a perfectly legitimate college pathway.\n\n1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:05.640\n So that was like a big green light for a lot of schools\n\n1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:08.520\n who were like wondering about whether they could teach it.\n\n1:29:08.520 --> 1:29:12.280\n So I think it happens in small spaces and expands.\n\n1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:13.480\n It goes viral.\n\n1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:14.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:14.320 --> 1:29:15.160\n In this modern age.\n\n1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:16.000\n Then it goes viral.\n\n1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.000\n California's ahead, I think in creating courses\n\n1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.360\n and having kids go through it, but it's suddenly,\n\n1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:27.400\n when I last looked, there were 12 states\n\n1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:29.720\n that were allowing data science as a high school course.\n\n1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:34.720\n And I think by next year, that will have doubled or more.\n\n1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:38.400\n So change is happening.\n\n1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:41.920\n Joe, as I said, I think mathematics\n\n1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:45.120\n is truly a beautiful subject.\n\n1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:48.560\n And you having an impact on millions of people\n\n1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:52.200\n and you having an impact on millions of people's lives\n\n1:29:52.200 --> 1:29:56.160\n by educating them, by inspiring teachers to educate\n\n1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:57.960\n in the ways that you've talked about\n\n1:29:57.960 --> 1:30:01.440\n in multidimensional ways, in visual ways,\n\n1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:02.440\n I think is incredible.\n\n1:30:02.440 --> 1:30:06.040\n So you're spreading beauty into the world.\n\n1:30:06.040 --> 1:30:07.520\n So I really, really appreciate\n\n1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:09.240\n that you spend your valuable time with me today.\n\n1:30:09.240 --> 1:30:10.080\n Thank you for talking.\n\n1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:10.920\n Thank you.\n\n1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:12.560\n It was really good to talk to you.\n\n1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:15.280\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Boller.\n\n1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:16.680\n To support this podcast,\n\n1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:19.520\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:21.400\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n1:30:21.400 --> 1:30:23.640\n from Albert Einstein.\n\n1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:27.960\n Pure mathematics is the poetry of logical ideas.\n\n1:30:27.960 --> 1:30:46.960\n Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
