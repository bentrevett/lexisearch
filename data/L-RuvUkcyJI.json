00:08.100\n on infectious disease and immunology.\n\n00:08.100 --> 00:10.640\n The most defining characteristic of his approach\n\n00:10.640 --> 00:14.060\n to science and biology is that of a first principles thinker\n\n00:14.060 --> 00:17.820\n and engineer focused not just on defining the problem,\n\n00:17.820 --> 00:20.100\n but finding the solution.\n\n00:20.100 --> 00:24.020\n In that spirit, we talk about cheap rapid at home testing,\n\n00:24.020 --> 00:27.260\n which is a solution to COVID 19 that to me has become\n\n00:27.260 --> 00:31.520\n one of the most obvious, powerful, and doable solutions\n\n00:31.520 --> 00:33.780\n that frankly should have been done months ago\n\n00:33.780 --> 00:35.700\n and still should be done now.\n\n00:35.700 --> 00:37.700\n As we talk about its accuracy,\n\n00:37.700 --> 00:40.360\n it's high for detecting actual contagiousness\n\n00:40.360 --> 00:43.000\n and hundreds of millions can be manufactured quickly\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:44.660\n and relatively cheaply.\n\n00:44.660 --> 00:47.580\n In general, I love engineering solutions like these\n\n00:47.580 --> 00:51.280\n even if government bureaucracies often don't.\n\n00:51.280 --> 00:54.920\n It respects science and data, it respects our freedom,\n\n00:54.920 --> 00:58.180\n it respects our intelligence and basic common sense.\n\n00:59.180 --> 01:00.500\n Quick mention of each sponsor\n\n01:00.500 --> 01:02.860\n followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n01:02.860 --> 01:06.580\n Thank you to Brave, a fast browser that feels like Chrome\n\n01:06.580 --> 01:09.200\n but has more privacy preserving features,\n\n01:09.200 --> 01:11.500\n Athletic Greens, the all in one drink\n\n01:11.500 --> 01:12.780\n that I start every day with\n\n01:12.780 --> 01:14.980\n to cover all my nutritional bases,\n\n01:14.980 --> 01:18.340\n ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years\n\n01:18.340 --> 01:20.380\n to protect my privacy on the internet,\n\n01:20.380 --> 01:24.380\n and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.\n\n01:24.380 --> 01:26.780\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n01:26.780 --> 01:29.980\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:29.980 --> 01:31.620\n As a side note, let me say that\n\n01:31.620 --> 01:35.660\n I've always been solution oriented, not problem oriented.\n\n01:35.660 --> 01:38.180\n It saddens me to see that public discourse\n\n01:38.180 --> 01:41.060\n disproportionately focuses on the mistakes\n\n01:41.060 --> 01:43.620\n of those who dare to build solutions\n\n01:43.620 --> 01:46.380\n rather than applaud their attempt to do so.\n\n01:46.380 --> 01:48.260\n Teddy Roosevelt said it well\n\n01:48.260 --> 01:52.220\n in his The Man in the Arena speech over 100 years ago.\n\n01:52.220 --> 01:54.580\n I should say that both the critic\n\n01:54.580 --> 01:56.820\n and the creator are important,\n\n01:56.820 --> 01:59.140\n but in my humble estimation,\n\n01:59.140 --> 02:01.740\n there are too many now of the former\n\n02:01.740 --> 02:03.600\n and not enough of the latter.\n\n02:03.600 --> 02:06.860\n So while we spread the derisive words\n\n02:06.860 --> 02:10.220\n of the critic on social media, making it viral,\n\n02:10.220 --> 02:13.060\n let's not forget that this world is built\n\n02:13.060 --> 02:17.180\n on the blood, sweat, and tears of those who dare to create.\n\n02:18.020 --> 02:20.320\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:20.320 --> 02:22.380\n review it with five stars on Apple

conversation with Michael Minna.\n\n02:32.580 --> 02:35.140\n What is the most beautiful, mysterious,\n\n02:35.140 --> 02:39.620\n or surprising idea in the biology of humans or viruses\n\n02:39.620 --> 02:41.720\n that you've ever come across in your work?\n\n02:41.720 --> 02:43.860\n Sorry for the overly philosophical question.\n\n02:45.260 --> 02:47.720\n Wow, well that's a great question.\n\n02:47.720 --> 02:50.340\n You know, I love the pathogenesis of viruses,\n\n02:50.340 --> 02:55.340\n and one of the things that I've worked on a lot\n\n02:56.060 --> 03:00.740\n is trying to understand how viruses interact with each other.\n\n03:00.740 --> 03:05.420\n And so pre all this COVID stuff,\n\n03:05.420 --> 03:08.980\n I was really, really dedicated to understanding\n\n03:10.100 --> 03:14.980\n how viruses impact other pathogens,\n\n03:14.980 --> 03:18.140\n so how if somebody gets an infection with one thing\n\n03:18.140 --> 03:21.660\n or a vaccine, does it either benefit or harm you\n\n03:21.660 --> 03:26.660\n from other things that appear to be unrelated to most people.\n\n03:26.940 --> 03:31.940\n And so one system which is highly detrimental to humans,\n\n03:32.660 --> 03:37.260\n but what I think is just immensely fascinating, is measles.\n\n03:37.260 --> 03:40.900\n And measles gets into a kid's body.\n\n03:40.900 --> 03:43.180\n The immune system picks it up,\n\n03:43.180 --> 03:47.660\n and essentially grabs the virus,\n\n03:47.660 --> 03:50.820\n and does exactly what it's supposed to do,\n\n03:50.820 --> 03:52.260\n which is to take this virus\n\n03:52.260 --> 03:54.020\n and bring it into the immune system\n\n03:54.020 --> 03:56.340\n so that the immune system can learn from it,\n\n03:56.340 --> 03:58.820\n can develop an immune response to it.\n\n03:58.820 --> 04:00.740\n But instead, measles plays a trick.\n\n04:00.740 --> 04:03.060\n It gets into the immune system,\n\n04:03.060 --> 04:05.160\n serves almost as a Trojan horse,\n\n04:05.160 --> 04:08.540\n and instead of getting eaten by these cells,\n\n04:08.540 --> 04:10.060\n it just takes them over,\n\n04:10.060 --> 04:12.260\n and it ends up proliferating in the very cells\n\n04:12.260 --> 04:14.520\n that were supposed to kill it.\n\n04:15.420 --> 04:17.960\n And it just distributes throughout the entire body,\n\n04:17.960 --> 04:19.140\n gets into the bone marrow,\n\n04:19.140 --> 04:22.620\n kills off children's immune memories.\n\n04:22.620 --> 04:25.500\n And so it essentially, what I've found\n\n04:25.500 --> 04:28.680\n and what my research has found is that this one virus\n\n04:28.680 --> 04:31.620\n was responsible for as much as half\n\n04:31.620 --> 04:34.320\n of all of the infectious disease deaths in kids\n\n04:34.320 --> 04:36.420\n before we started vaccinating against it,\n\n04:36.420 --> 04:40.200\n because it was just wiping out children's immune memories\n\n04:40.200 --> 04:41.560\n to all different pathogens,\n\n04:41.560 --> 04:45.100\n which is, I think, just astounding.\n\n04:45.100 --> 04:49.000\n It's just amazing to watch it spread throughout bodies.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:50.400\n We've done the studies in monkeys,\n\n04:50.400 --> 04:52.900\n and you can watch it just destroy\n\n04:52.900 --> 04:54.860\n and obliterate people's immune memories\n\n04:54.860 --> 04:57.140\n in the same way that some parasite\n\n04:57.140 --> 04:58.860\n might destroy somebody's brain.\n\n04:59.900 --> 05:03.480\n Is that evolutionary just coincidence,\n\n05:03.480 --> 05:04.980\n or is there some kind of advantage\n\n05:04.980 --> 05:08.560\n to this kind of interactivity between pathogens?\n\n05:08.560 --> 05:11.740\n Oh, I think in that sense, it's just coincidence.\n\n05:11.740 --> 05:15.520\n It probably is a, it's a good way for measles to,\n\n05:17.600 --> 05:19.540\n it's a good way for measles to essentially\n\n05:19.540 --> 05:23.180\n be able to survive long enough to replicate in the body.\n\n05:23.180 --> 05:25.180\n It just replicates in the cells\n\n05:25.180 --> 05:26.480\n that are meant to destroy it.\n\n05:26.480 --> 05:31.480\n So it's utilizing our immune cells for its own replication,\n\n05:32.180 --> 05:34.500\n but in so doing, it's destroying the memories\n\n05:34.500 --> 05:37.180\n of all the other immunological memories.\n\n05:37.180 --> 05:38.780\n But there are other viruses,\n\n05:38.780 --> 05:42.200\n so a different system is influenza,\n\n05:42.200 --> 05:47.200\n and flu predisposes to severe bacterial infections.\n\n05:47.940 --> 05:50.580\n And that, I think, is another coincidence,\n\n05:50.580 --> 05:55.380\n but I also think that there are some evolutionary benefits\n\n05:55.380 --> 05:57.380\n that bacteria may hijack\n\n05:57.380 --> 05:59.460\n and sort of piggyback on viral infections.\n\n05:59.460 --> 06:04.220\n Viruses can, they just grow so much quicker than bacteria.\n\n06:04.220 --> 06:05.580\n They replicate faster,\n\n06:05.580 --> 06:07.660\n and so there's this system with viruses,\n\n06:07.660 --> 06:09.220\n with flu and bacteria,\n\n06:09.220 --> 06:12.620\n where the influenza has these proteins\n\n06:12.620 --> 06:14.780\n that cleave certain receptors,\n\n06:15.660 --> 06:18.140\n and the bacteria want to cleave those same receptors.\n\n06:18.140 --> 06:19.640\n They want to cleave the same molecules\n\n06:19.640 --> 06:22.780\n that gave entrance to those receptors.\n\n06:22.780 --> 06:25.140\n So instead, the bacteria found out, like,\n\n06:25.140 --> 06:28.020\n hey, we could just piggyback on these viruses.\n\n06:28.020 --> 06:31.700\n They'll do it 100 or 1,000 times faster than we can.\n\n06:31.700 --> 06:33.860\n And so then they just piggyback on,\n\n06:33.860 --> 06:37.020\n and they let flu cleave all these sialic acids,\n\n06:37.020 --> 06:39.860\n and then the bacteria just glom on in the wake of it.\n\n06:39.860 --> 06:43.100\n So there's all different interactions between pathogens\n\n06:43.100 --> 06:45.280\n that are just remarkable.\n\n06:45.280 --> 06:48.220\n So does this whole system of viruses\n\n06:48.220 --> 06:49.420\n that interact with each other\n\n06:49.420 --> 06:52.100\n and so damn good at getting inside our bodies,\n\n06:52.100 --> 06:54.880\n does that fascinate you or terrify you?\n\n06:54.880 --> 06:56.320\n I'm very much a scientist,\n\n06:56.320 --> 07:00.500\n and so it fascinates me much more than it terrifies me.\n\n07:00.500 --> 07:03.540\n But knowing enough, I know just how well,\n\n07:03.540 --> 07:08.380\n you know, we get the wrong virus in our population,\n\n07:08.380 --> 07:10.460\n whether it's through some random mutation\n\n07:10.460 --> 07:12.680\n or whether it's this same COVID 19 virus,\n\n07:12.680 --> 07:14.580\n and it, you know, these things are tricky.\n\n07:14.580 --> 07:17.400\n They're able to mutate quickly.\n\n07:17.400 --> 07:20.540\n They're able to find new hosts\n\n07:20.540 --> 07:22.920\n and rearrange in the case of influenza.\n\n07:24.060 --> 07:27.220\n So what terrifies me is just how easily\n\n07:27.220 --> 07:29.760\n this particular pandemic could have been so much worse.\n\n07:29.760 --> 07:30.880\n This could have been a virus\n\n07:30.880 --> 07:33.980\n that is much worse than it is.\n\n07:33.980 --> 07:37.340\n You know, same thing with H1N1 back in 2009.\n\n07:37.340 --> 07:38.320\n That terrifies me.\n\n07:38.320 --> 07:41.620\n If a virus like that was much more detrimental,\n\n07:43.060 --> 07:44.620\n you know, that would be,\n\n07:44.620 --> 07:46.720\n it could be much more devastating.\n\n07:46.720 --> 07:48.100\n Although it's hard to say, you know,\n\n07:48.100 --> 07:52.220\n the human species were, well,\n\n07:52.220 --> 07:56.100\n I hesitate to say that we're good at responding to things\n\n07:56.100 --> 07:58.660\n because there are some aspects that were,\n\n07:58.660 --> 08:01.740\n this particular virus, SARS COVID 2 and COVID 19\n\n08:01.740 --> 08:06.640\n has found a sweet spot where it's not quite serious enough\n\n08:06.640 --> 08:08.860\n on an individual level that humans just don't,\n\n08:08.860 --> 08:12.860\n we haven't seen much of a useful response by many humans.\n\n08:14.060 --> 08:15.860\n A lot of people even think it's a hoax.\n\n08:15.860 --> 08:18.140\n And so it's led us down this path of,\n\n08:19.420 --> 08:20.900\n it's not quite serious enough\n\n08:20.900 --> 08:23.140\n to get everyone to respond immediately\n\n08:23.140 --> 08:26.140\n and with the most urgency, but it's enough,\n\n08:26.140 --> 08:27.540\n it's bad enough that, you know,\n\n08:27.540 --> 08:30.160\n it's caused our economies to shut down and collapse.\n\n08:30.160 --> 08:34.180\n And so I think I know enough about virus biology\n\n08:34.180 --> 08:37.180\n to be terrified for humans that, you know,\n\n08:37.180 --> 08:39.220\n it can, it just takes one virus,\n\n08:39.220 --> 08:42.100\n just takes the wrong one to just obliterate us\n\n08:42.100 --> 08:43.660\n or not obliterate us,\n\n08:43.660 --> 08:45.860\n but really do much more damage than we've seen.\n\n08:45.860 --> 08:47.540\n It's fascinating to think that COVID 19\n\n08:47.540 --> 08:52.540\n is a result of a virus evolving together with like Twitter,\n\n08:52.820 --> 08:55.580\n like figuring out how we can sneak past the defenses\n\n08:55.580 --> 08:56.820\n of the humans.\n\n08:56.820 --> 08:58.820\n So it's not bad enough.\n\n08:58.820 --> 09:00.380\n And then the misinformation,\n\n09:00.380 --> 09:03.060\n all that kind of stuff together is operating\n\n09:03.060 --> 09:06.300\n in such a way that the virus can spread effectively.\n\n09:06.300 --> 09:10.380\n I wonder, I mean, obviously a virus is not intelligent,\n\n09:10.380 --> 09:15.380\n but there's a rhyme and a rhythm\n\n09:16.260 --> 09:18.300\n to the way this whole evolutionary process works\n\n09:18.300 --> 09:20.140\n and creates these fascinating things\n\n09:20.140 --> 09:23.060\n that spread throughout the entire civilization.\n\n09:23.060 --> 09:26.860\n Absolutely, it's, yeah,\n\n09:26.860 --> 09:30.140\n I'm completely fascinated by this idea\n\n09:30.140 --> 09:33.700\n of social media in particular,\n\n09:33.700 --> 09:36.460\n how it replicates, how it grows.\n\n09:36.460 --> 09:40.140\n You know, I've been, how it actually starts interacting\n\n09:40.140 --> 09:42.860\n with the biology of the virus, masks,\n\n09:42.860 --> 09:45.020\n who's gonna get vaccinated, politics,\n\n09:45.020 --> 09:49.340\n like these seem so external to virus biology,\n\n09:49.340 --> 09:52.220\n but it's become so intertwined.\n\n09:52.220 --> 09:55.140\n And it's interesting.\n\n09:55.140 --> 09:56.660\n And I actually think we could find out\n\n09:56.660 --> 09:59.260\n that the virus actually becomes,\n\n10:00.580 --> 10:03.780\n obviously not intentionally,\n\n10:03.780 --> 10:08.380\n but we could find that people choosing not to wear masks,\n\n10:08.380 --> 10:10.940\n choosing not to counter this virus\n\n10:10.940 --> 10:14.260\n in a regimented and sort of organized way,\n\n10:14.260 --> 10:18.060\n effectively gives the virus more opportunity to escape.\n\n10:18.060 --> 10:20.740\n We can look at vaccines.\n\n10:20.740 --> 10:23.220\n We're about to have\n\n10:23.220 --> 10:25.380\n one of the most aggressive vaccination programs\n\n10:25.380 --> 10:26.740\n the world has ever seen.\n\n10:27.660 --> 10:29.740\n But we are unfortunately doing it\n\n10:29.740 --> 10:32.100\n right at the peak of viral transmission\n\n10:32.100 --> 10:34.020\n when millions and millions of people\n\n10:34.020 --> 10:35.500\n are still getting infected.\n\n10:36.420 --> 10:37.340\n And when we do that,\n\n10:37.340 --> 10:40.500\n that just gives this virus so many more opportunities.\n\n10:40.500 --> 10:43.620\n I mean, orders of magnitude more opportunity\n\n10:43.620 --> 10:46.340\n to mutate around our immune system.\n\n10:46.340 --> 10:48.220\n Now, if we were to vaccinate everyone\n\n10:48.220 --> 10:49.820\n when there's not a lot of virus,\n\n10:49.820 --> 10:51.340\n then there's just not a lot of virus.\n\n10:51.340 --> 10:54.180\n And so there's not going to be as many,\n\n10:54.180 --> 10:56.180\n I don't even know how many zeros are at the end\n\n10:56.180 --> 10:57.660\n of however many viral particles\n\n10:57.660 --> 10:59.540\n there are in the world right now,\n\n10:59.540 --> 11:02.020\n more than quadrillions.\n\n11:02.020 --> 11:04.700\n And so if you assume that at any given time,\n\n11:04.700 --> 11:06.660\n somebody might have trillions of virus in them\n\n11:06.660 --> 11:07.980\n and any given individual,\n\n11:07.980 --> 11:10.620\n so then multiply trillions by millions\n\n11:10.620 --> 11:12.980\n and you get a lot of viruses out there.\n\n11:12.980 --> 11:16.260\n And if you start applying pressure, ecological pressure,\n\n11:16.260 --> 11:21.260\n to this virus, that when it's not abundant,\n\n11:21.260 --> 11:25.260\n God, the opportunity for a virus to sneak around immunity,\n\n11:25.260 --> 11:27.860\n especially when all the vaccines are identical,\n\n11:27.860 --> 11:30.140\n essentially, it's...\n\n11:30.140 --> 11:32.820\n All it takes is one to mutate and then jumps.\n\n11:32.820 --> 11:33.660\n Takes one.\n\n11:33.660 --> 11:35.180\n Takes one in the whole world.\n\n11:35.180 --> 11:37.060\n And we have to not forget\n\n11:37.060 --> 11:39.780\n that this particular virus was one.\n\n11:39.780 --> 11:42.940\n It was one opportunity and it has spread across the globe\n\n11:42.940 --> 11:46.140\n and there's no reason that can't happen tomorrow anew.\n\n11:46.140 --> 11:48.060\n It's scary.\n\n11:49.300 --> 11:51.380\n I have a million other questions in this direction,\n\n11:51.380 --> 11:56.100\n but I'd love to talk about one of the most exciting aspects\n\n11:56.100 --> 12:00.700\n of your work, which is testing or rapid testing.\n\n12:00.700 --> 12:04.940\n You wrote a great article in Time on November 17th.\n\n12:04.940 --> 12:09.940\n This is like a month ago about rapid testing titled,\n\n12:10.060 --> 12:13.420\n How We Can Stop the Spread of COVID 19 by Christmas.\n\n12:13.420 --> 12:15.700\n Let's jot down the fact that this is a month ago.\n\n12:15.700 --> 12:17.940\n So maybe your timeline would be different,\n\n12:17.940 --> 12:19.460\n but let's say in a month.\n\n12:19.460 --> 12:21.380\n So you've talked about this powerful idea\n\n12:21.380 --> 12:25.380\n for quite a while throughout the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\n12:25.380 --> 12:28.120\n How do we stop the spread of COVID 19 in a month?\n\n12:29.260 --> 12:33.620\n Well, we use tests like these.\n\n12:33.620 --> 12:36.980\n So the only reason the virus continues spreading\n\n12:36.980 --> 12:39.380\n is because people spread it to each other.\n\n12:39.380 --> 12:41.060\n This isn't magic.\n\n12:41.060 --> 12:42.140\n Yes.\n\n12:42.140 --> 12:45.700\n And so there's a few ways to stop the virus\n\n12:45.700 --> 12:47.940\n from spreading to each other.\n\n12:47.940 --> 12:51.980\n And that is you either can vaccinate everyone\n\n12:51.980 --> 12:55.300\n and vaccinating everyone is a way to immunologically\n\n12:55.300 --> 12:57.500\n prevent the virus from growing inside of somebody\n\n12:57.500 --> 12:58.760\n and therefore spreading.\n\n12:58.760 --> 13:01.220\n We don't know yet actually if this vaccine,\n\n13:01.220 --> 13:03.520\n if any of these vaccines are going to\n\n13:03.520 --> 13:05.160\n prevent onward transmission.\n\n13:05.160 --> 13:10.060\n So that may or may not serve to be one opportunity.\n\n13:10.060 --> 13:12.680\n Certainly I think it will decrease transmission.\n\n13:12.680 --> 13:16.220\n But the other idea that we have at our disposal now,\n\n13:16.220 --> 13:18.540\n we had it in May, we had it in June,\n\n13:18.540 --> 13:21.100\n July, August, September, October, November,\n\n13:21.100 --> 13:22.660\n and now it's December.\n\n13:22.660 --> 13:23.720\n We still have it.\n\n13:23.720 --> 13:26.040\n We still choose not to use it in this country\n\n13:26.040 --> 13:28.140\n and in much of the world.\n\n13:28.140 --> 13:29.300\n And that's rapid testing.\n\n13:29.300 --> 13:32.340\n That is giving, it's empowering people to know\n\n13:33.260 --> 13:35.980\n that they are infected and giving them the opportunity\n\n13:35.980 --> 13:38.340\n to not spread it to their loved ones\n\n13:38.340 --> 13:40.780\n and their friends and neighbors and whoever else.\n\n13:41.860 --> 13:43.640\n We could have done this.\n\n13:43.640 --> 13:44.740\n We still can.\n\n13:44.740 --> 13:46.380\n Today we could start.\n\n13:46.380 --> 13:48.540\n We have millions of these tests.\n\n13:48.540 --> 13:51.820\n These tests are simple paper strip tests.\n\n13:51.820 --> 13:54.660\n They are, inside of this thing\n\n13:54.660 --> 13:56.440\n is just a little piece of paper.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.340\n Now I can actually open it up here.\n\n14:00.340 --> 14:01.540\n There we go.\n\n14:01.540 --> 14:05.260\n So this, this is how we do it right here.\n\n14:05.260 --> 14:08.140\n We have this little paper strip test.\n\n14:08.140 --> 14:11.160\n This is enough to let you know if you're infectious.\n\n14:11.160 --> 14:14.700\n With somewhere around the order of 99% sensitivity,\n\n14:14.700 --> 14:18.100\n 99% specificity, you can know\n\n14:18.100 --> 14:20.820\n if you have infectious virus in you.\n\n14:20.820 --> 14:23.220\n If we can get these out to everyone's homes,\n\n14:23.220 --> 14:25.220\n build these, make 10 million, 20 million,\n\n14:25.220 --> 14:26.820\n 30 million of them a day.\n\n14:26.820 --> 14:30.500\n You know, we make more bottles of Dasani water every day.\n\n14:30.500 --> 14:33.500\n We can make these little paper strip tests.\n\n14:33.500 --> 14:36.660\n And if we do that and we get these into people's homes\n\n14:36.660 --> 14:39.060\n so that they can use them twice a week,\n\n14:39.060 --> 14:41.980\n then we can know if we're infectious.\n\n14:41.980 --> 14:43.140\n You know, is it perfect?\n\n14:43.140 --> 14:44.060\n Absolutely not.\n\n14:44.060 --> 14:45.140\n But is it near perfect?\n\n14:45.140 --> 14:46.340\n Absolutely.\n\n14:46.340 --> 14:48.540\n You know, and so if we can say,\n\n14:48.540 --> 14:51.380\n hey, the transmission of this is, you know,\n\n14:51.380 --> 14:54.720\n for every hundred people that get infected right now,\n\n14:54.720 --> 14:57.980\n they go on to infect maybe 130 additional people.\n\n14:57.980 --> 14:59.180\n And that's exponential growth.\n\n14:59.180 --> 15:01.340\n So a hundred becomes 130.\n\n15:01.340 --> 15:04.260\n A couple of days later that 130 becomes\n\n15:04.260 --> 15:08.660\n another 165 people have now been infected.\n\n15:08.660 --> 15:10.420\n And you know, go over three weeks\n\n15:10.420 --> 15:13.940\n and a hundred people become 500 people infected.\n\n15:13.940 --> 15:17.080\n Now it doesn't take much to have those hundred people\n\n15:17.080 --> 15:19.760\n not infect 130, but infect 90.\n\n15:20.760 --> 15:24.540\n All we have to do is remove say 30, 40% of new infections\n\n15:24.540 --> 15:26.300\n from continuing their spread.\n\n15:26.300 --> 15:28.060\n And then instead of exponential growth,\n\n15:28.060 --> 15:30.060\n you have exponential decay.\n\n15:30.060 --> 15:32.020\n So this doesn't need to be perfect.\n\n15:32.020 --> 15:34.180\n We don't have to go from a hundred to zero.\n\n15:34.180 --> 15:37.300\n We just have to go and have those hundred people infect 90\n\n15:37.300 --> 15:40.660\n and those 90 people infect, you know, 82,\n\n15:40.660 --> 15:41.820\n whatever it might be.\n\n15:41.820 --> 15:43.760\n And you do that for a few weeks and boom,\n\n15:43.760 --> 15:45.780\n you have now gone instead of a hundred to 500,\n\n15:45.780 --> 15:48.060\n you've gone from a hundred to 20.\n\n15:48.060 --> 15:49.740\n It's not very hard.\n\n15:49.740 --> 15:53.220\n And so the way to do that is to let people know\n\n15:54.300 --> 15:55.300\n that they're infectious.\n\n15:55.300 --> 15:58.780\n I mean, we're a perfect example right now.\n\n15:58.780 --> 16:02.340\n This morning I used these tests to make sure\n\n16:02.340 --> 16:03.700\n that I wasn't infectious.\n\n16:03.700 --> 16:04.540\n Is it perfect?\n\n16:04.540 --> 16:06.900\n No, but it reduced my odds 99%.\n\n16:06.900 --> 16:08.660\n I already was at extremely low odds\n\n16:08.660 --> 16:11.520\n because I spend my life quarantining these days.\n\n16:11.520 --> 16:13.780\n Well, the interesting thing with this test,\n\n16:13.780 --> 16:15.040\n with the testing in general,\n\n16:15.040 --> 16:17.380\n which is why I love what you've been espousing,\n\n16:17.380 --> 16:20.220\n is it's really confusing to me that this has not been\n\n16:20.220 --> 16:24.700\n taken on as it's one actual solution\n\n16:24.700 --> 16:28.740\n that was available for a long time.\n\n16:28.740 --> 16:33.740\n There doesn't seem to have been solutions proposed\n\n16:33.780 --> 16:36.860\n at a large scale and a solution that it seems\n\n16:36.860 --> 16:38.840\n like a lot of people would be able to get behind.\n\n16:38.840 --> 16:43.840\n There's some politicization or fear of other solutions\n\n16:44.240 --> 16:47.100\n that people have proposed, which is like lockdown.\n\n16:47.100 --> 16:48.260\n And there's a worry, you know,\n\n16:48.260 --> 16:50.740\n especially in the American spirit of freedom,\n\n16:50.740 --> 16:52.640\n like you can't tell me what to do.\n\n16:52.640 --> 16:56.980\n The thing about tests is it like empowers you\n\n16:56.980 --> 16:59.100\n with information essentially.\n\n16:59.100 --> 17:04.100\n So like it gives you more information about your,\n\n17:06.180 --> 17:07.980\n like your role in this pandemic,\n\n17:07.980 --> 17:10.420\n and then you can do whatever the hell you want.\n\n17:10.420 --> 17:13.020\n Like it's all up to your ethics and so on.\n\n17:13.020 --> 17:16.800\n So like, and it's obvious that with that information,\n\n17:16.800 --> 17:19.500\n people would be able to protect their loved ones\n\n17:19.500 --> 17:23.580\n and also do their sort of quote unquote duty\n\n17:23.580 --> 17:25.000\n for their country, right?\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:26.820\n Is protect the rest of the country.\n\n17:26.820 --> 17:27.820\n That's exactly right.\n\n17:27.820 --> 17:30.300\n I mean, it's just, it's empowerment,\n\n17:30.300 --> 17:32.220\n but you know, this is a problem.\n\n17:32.220 --> 17:35.280\n We have not put these into action in large part\n\n17:35.280 --> 17:37.860\n because we have a medical industry\n\n17:37.860 --> 17:40.200\n that doesn't want to see them be used.\n\n17:40.200 --> 17:44.140\n We have a political and a regulatory industry\n\n17:44.140 --> 17:45.620\n that doesn't want to see them be used.\n\n17:45.620 --> 17:46.500\n That sounds crazy.\n\n17:46.500 --> 17:48.820\n Why wouldn't they want them to be used?\n\n17:48.820 --> 17:51.180\n We have a very paternalistic approach\n\n17:51.180 --> 17:52.620\n to everything in this country.\n\n17:52.620 --> 17:55.500\n You know, despite this country kind of being founded\n\n17:55.500 --> 17:58.340\n on this individualistic ideal,\n\n17:58.340 --> 18:01.420\n pull yourself up from your bootstraps, all that stuff.\n\n18:01.420 --> 18:03.240\n When it comes to public health,\n\n18:03.240 --> 18:08.240\n we have a bunch of ivory tower academics who want data.\n\n18:09.300 --> 18:12.340\n They, you know, they want to see perfection.\n\n18:12.340 --> 18:15.900\n And we have this issue of letting perfection\n\n18:15.900 --> 18:19.500\n get in the way of actually doing something at all,\n\n18:19.500 --> 18:21.500\n you know, doing something effective.\n\n18:21.500 --> 18:25.080\n And so we keep comparing these tests, for example,\n\n18:25.080 --> 18:27.980\n to the laboratory based PCR test.\n\n18:27.980 --> 18:30.780\n And sure, this isn't a PCR test,\n\n18:30.780 --> 18:32.440\n but this doesn't cost a hundred dollars\n\n18:32.440 --> 18:34.740\n and it doesn't take five days to get back,\n\n18:34.740 --> 18:36.780\n which means in every single scenario,\n\n18:36.780 --> 18:38.860\n this is the more effective test.\n\n18:38.860 --> 18:41.700\n And we have, unfortunately, a system\n\n18:41.700 --> 18:42.940\n that's not about public health.\n\n18:42.940 --> 18:47.940\n We have entirely eroded any ideals of public health\n\n18:48.180 --> 18:51.340\n in our country for the biomedical complex,\n\n18:51.340 --> 18:53.220\n you know, this medical industrial complex,\n\n18:53.220 --> 18:55.260\n which overrides everything.\n\n18:55.260 --> 18:57.060\n And that's why, you know, I'm just,\n\n18:58.620 --> 18:59.700\n can I swear on this pot?\n\n18:59.700 --> 19:00.540\n Yes.\n\n19:00.540 --> 19:05.540\n I'm just so fucking pissed that these tests don't exist.\n\n19:06.160 --> 19:08.460\n Meanwhile, and everyone says, you know,\n\n19:08.460 --> 19:10.100\n oh, we couldn't make these, you know,\n\n19:10.100 --> 19:11.180\n that we could never do it.\n\n19:11.180 --> 19:14.380\n That would be such a hard, a difficult problem.\n\n19:14.380 --> 19:16.260\n Meanwhile, the vaccine gets,\n\n19:16.260 --> 19:18.740\n we have at the same time that we could have gotten\n\n19:18.740 --> 19:22.020\n these stupid little paper strip tests out to every household,\n\n19:22.020 --> 19:25.300\n we have developed a brand new vaccine.\n\n19:25.300 --> 19:27.980\n We've gone through phase one, phase two, phase three trials.\n\n19:27.980 --> 19:29.980\n We've scaled up its production.\n\n19:29.980 --> 19:31.860\n And now we have UPS and FedEx\n\n19:31.860 --> 19:33.800\n and all the logistics in the world,\n\n19:33.800 --> 19:35.860\n getting freezers out to where they need to be.\n\n19:35.860 --> 19:39.260\n We have this immense, we see when it comes to sort of\n\n19:39.260 --> 19:42.380\n medicine, you know, something you're injecting into somebody,\n\n19:42.380 --> 19:45.520\n then all of a sudden people say, oh, yes we can.\n\n19:45.520 --> 19:48.640\n But you say, oh no, that's too simple a solution,\n\n19:48.640 --> 19:49.740\n too cheap a solution.\n\n19:49.740 --> 19:52.140\n No way could we possibly do that.\n\n19:52.140 --> 19:54.020\n It's this faulty thinking in our country,\n\n19:54.020 --> 19:58.340\n which, you know, frankly is driven by big money, big,\n\n19:58.340 --> 20:00.740\n you know, the only time when we actually think\n\n20:00.740 --> 20:03.460\n that we can do something that's maybe aggressive\n\n20:03.460 --> 20:05.660\n and complicated is when there's billions and billions\n\n20:05.660 --> 20:08.020\n of billions of dollars in it, you know.\n\n20:08.020 --> 20:09.980\n I mean, on a difficult note, because this is part\n\n20:09.980 --> 20:12.180\n of your work from before the COVID,\n\n20:12.180 --> 20:15.820\n it does seem that I saw a statistic currently\n\n20:15.820 --> 20:18.380\n is that 40% would not be taken,\n\n20:18.380 --> 20:20.500\n of Americans would not be taking the vaccine,\n\n20:20.500 --> 20:21.740\n some number like this.\n\n20:21.740 --> 20:24.060\n So you also have to acknowledge that all the money\n\n20:24.060 --> 20:26.980\n that's been invested, like there doesn't appear\n\n20:26.980 --> 20:30.340\n to be a solution to deal with like the fear,\n\n20:30.340 --> 20:32.260\n distrust that people have.\n\n20:32.260 --> 20:34.700\n I bet, I don't know if you know this number,\n\n20:34.700 --> 20:38.300\n but for taking a strip, like a rapid test like this,\n\n20:38.300 --> 20:41.100\n I bet you people would say,\n\n20:41.100 --> 20:43.060\n like the percentage of people that wouldn't take it\n\n20:43.060 --> 20:45.260\n is in the single digits, probably.\n\n20:45.260 --> 20:46.820\n I completely think so.\n\n20:46.820 --> 20:48.060\n And you know, there's a lot of people\n\n20:48.060 --> 20:50.420\n who don't want to get a test today.\n\n20:50.420 --> 20:53.100\n And that's because it gets sent to a lab,\n\n20:53.100 --> 20:55.820\n it gets reported, it has all this stuff.\n\n20:55.820 --> 20:58.900\n And we're a country which teaches people\n\n20:58.900 --> 21:01.060\n from the time they're babies, you know,\n\n21:01.060 --> 21:04.500\n to keep their medical data close to them.\n\n21:04.500 --> 21:05.900\n We have HIPAA, we have all these,\n\n21:05.900 --> 21:07.700\n we have immense rules and regulations\n\n21:07.700 --> 21:11.540\n to ensure the privacy of people's medical data.\n\n21:11.540 --> 21:12.980\n And then a pandemic comes around\n\n21:12.980 --> 21:15.540\n and we just assume that the average person\n\n21:15.540 --> 21:17.580\n is gonna wipe all that away and say,\n\n21:17.580 --> 21:20.540\n oh no, I'm happy giving out not just my own medical data,\n\n21:20.540 --> 21:22.900\n but also to tell the authorities,\n\n21:22.900 --> 21:24.340\n everyone who I've spent my time with,\n\n21:24.340 --> 21:26.860\n so that they all get a call and are pissed at me\n\n21:26.860 --> 21:28.100\n for giving up their names.\n\n21:28.100 --> 21:29.860\n You know, so people aren't getting tested\n\n21:29.860 --> 21:32.980\n and they're definitely not giving up their contacts\n\n21:32.980 --> 21:34.860\n when it comes to contact tracing.\n\n21:34.860 --> 21:37.740\n And so for so many reasons, that approach is failing.\n\n21:38.980 --> 21:41.060\n Not to even mention the delays in testing\n\n21:41.060 --> 21:41.900\n and things like that.\n\n21:41.900 --> 21:44.500\n And so this is a whole different approach,\n\n21:44.500 --> 21:46.940\n but it's an approach that empowers people\n\n21:46.940 --> 21:51.220\n and takes the power a bit away from the people in charge.\n\n21:51.220 --> 21:54.260\n You know, and that's what's really grating on,\n\n21:54.260 --> 21:56.020\n I think, public health officials who say,\n\n21:56.020 --> 21:57.420\n no, we need the data.\n\n21:57.420 --> 22:00.540\n So they're effectively saying, if I can't have the data,\n\n22:00.540 --> 22:02.180\n I don't want the individuals,\n\n22:02.180 --> 22:04.740\n I don't want the public to have their own data either.\n\n22:04.740 --> 22:06.660\n Which is a terrible approach to a pandemic\n\n22:06.660 --> 22:09.820\n where we can't solve a public health crisis\n\n22:09.820 --> 22:12.820\n without actively engaging the public.\n\n22:13.700 --> 22:14.860\n It just doesn't work.\n\n22:14.860 --> 22:17.460\n And you know, and that's what we're trying to do right now,\n\n22:17.460 --> 22:19.180\n which is a terrible approach.\n\n22:19.180 --> 22:20.580\n So first of all, there's a,\n\n22:20.580 --> 22:22.420\n you have a really nice informative website,\n\n22:22.420 --> 22:24.900\n rapidtest.org, with information on this.\n\n22:24.900 --> 22:26.900\n I still can't believe this is not more popular.\n\n22:26.900 --> 22:27.740\n It's ridiculous.\n\n22:27.740 --> 22:32.740\n Okay, but our, one of the FAQs you have\n\n22:32.980 --> 22:35.180\n is a rapid test too expensive.\n\n22:35.180 --> 22:38.340\n So can cost be brought down?\n\n22:38.340 --> 22:41.820\n Like I pay, I take a weekly PCR test\n\n22:41.820 --> 22:46.180\n and I think I pay 160, 170 bucks a week.\n\n22:46.180 --> 22:47.420\n No, I mean, it's criminal.\n\n22:47.420 --> 22:49.380\n Absolutely we can get costs.\n\n22:49.380 --> 22:53.260\n This thing right here costs less than a dollar to make.\n\n22:53.260 --> 22:55.900\n With everything combined, plus the swabs,\n\n22:55.900 --> 22:58.060\n you know, maybe it costs a dollar 50.\n\n22:58.060 --> 23:02.580\n Could be sold for, frankly, it could be sold for $3\n\n23:02.580 --> 23:04.740\n and still make a profit if they wanna sell it for five.\n\n23:04.740 --> 23:08.940\n This one here, this is a slightly more complicated one,\n\n23:08.940 --> 23:10.980\n but you can see it's just got\n\n23:10.980 --> 23:13.740\n the exact same paper strip inside.\n\n23:13.740 --> 23:15.780\n And this is really, it doesn't look like much,\n\n23:15.780 --> 23:17.060\n but it's kind of the cream of the crop\n\n23:17.060 --> 23:19.340\n in terms of these rapid tests.\n\n23:19.340 --> 23:20.900\n This is the one that the US government bought\n\n23:20.900 --> 23:23.260\n and it is doing an amazing job.\n\n23:23.260 --> 23:27.620\n It has a 99.9% sensitivity and specificity.\n\n23:27.620 --> 23:29.540\n So it's really, it's really good.\n\n23:29.540 --> 23:31.860\n And so essentially the way it works is you just,\n\n23:31.860 --> 23:34.180\n you use a swab, you put the,\n\n23:34.180 --> 23:36.180\n once you kind of use a swab on yourself,\n\n23:36.180 --> 23:39.020\n you put the swab into these little holes here.\n\n23:39.020 --> 23:41.460\n You put some buffer on it and you close it\n\n23:41.460 --> 23:43.940\n and a line will show up if it's positive\n\n23:43.940 --> 23:45.780\n and a line won't show up if it's negative.\n\n23:45.780 --> 23:48.500\n It takes five, 10 minutes.\n\n23:48.500 --> 23:51.980\n This whole thing, this can be made so cheap\n\n23:51.980 --> 23:54.660\n that the US government was able to buy them,\n\n23:54.660 --> 23:59.660\n buy 150 million of them from Abbott for $5 a piece.\n\n24:00.460 --> 24:03.220\n So anyone who says that these are expensive,\n\n24:03.220 --> 24:05.140\n we have the proof is right here.\n\n24:05.140 --> 24:10.140\n This one at its, Abbott did not lose money on this deal.\n\n24:10.300 --> 24:14.820\n They got $750 million for selling 150 million of these\n\n24:14.820 --> 24:15.940\n at five bucks a piece.\n\n24:17.420 --> 24:20.460\n All of these tests can do the same.\n\n24:20.460 --> 24:22.500\n So anyone who says that these should be,\n\n24:22.500 --> 24:23.940\n unfortunately what's happening though\n\n24:23.940 --> 24:25.860\n is the FDA is only authorizing\n\n24:25.860 --> 24:28.380\n all of these tests as medical devices.\n\n24:28.380 --> 24:32.340\n So what happens when you, if I'm a medical company,\n\n24:32.340 --> 24:34.580\n if I'm a test production company\n\n24:34.580 --> 24:37.260\n and I wanna make this test and I go through\n\n24:37.260 --> 24:40.380\n and the FDA at the end of my authorization,\n\n24:40.380 --> 24:45.180\n the FDA says, okay, you now have a medical device,\n\n24:45.180 --> 24:47.880\n not a public health tool, but a medical device.\n\n24:47.880 --> 24:50.700\n And that affords you the ability to charge\n\n24:50.700 --> 24:52.060\n insurance companies for it.\n\n24:53.540 --> 24:55.980\n Why would I ever as a, you know,\n\n24:55.980 --> 25:00.980\n in our capitalistic economy and sort of infrastructure,\n\n25:01.180 --> 25:03.540\n why would I ever not sell this for $30\n\n25:03.540 --> 25:06.660\n when insurance will pay for it or $100?\n\n25:06.660 --> 25:09.340\n You know, it might only cost me 50 cents to make,\n\n25:09.340 --> 25:13.180\n but by pushing all of these tests through a medical pathway\n\n25:13.180 --> 25:17.280\n at the FDA, what extrudes out the other side\n\n25:17.280 --> 25:20.380\n is an expensive medical device that's erroneously expensive.\n\n25:20.380 --> 25:22.900\n It doesn't need to be inflated in cost,\n\n25:22.900 --> 25:27.100\n but the companies say, well, I'd rather make fewer of them\n\n25:27.100 --> 25:30.340\n and just sell them all for $30 a piece\n\n25:30.340 --> 25:34.000\n than make tens of millions of them, which I could do,\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:39.000\n and sell them at a dollar marginal profit.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:43.740\n And so it's a problem with our whole medical industry\n\n25:43.740 --> 25:46.420\n that we see tests only as medical devices\n\n25:46.420 --> 25:49.340\n and what I would like to see is for the government\n\n25:49.340 --> 25:51.740\n in the same way that they bought 150 million of these\n\n25:51.740 --> 25:55.660\n from Abbott, they should be buying, you know,\n\n25:55.660 --> 25:59.140\n all of these tests, they should be buying 20 million a day\n\n25:59.140 --> 26:00.700\n and getting them out to people's homes.\n\n26:00.700 --> 26:03.060\n This virus has cost trillions of dollars\n\n26:03.060 --> 26:05.020\n to the American people.\n\n26:05.020 --> 26:07.740\n It's closed down restaurants and stores\n\n26:07.740 --> 26:09.820\n and obviously the main streets across America\n\n26:09.820 --> 26:11.820\n have shuttered.\n\n26:11.820 --> 26:14.460\n It's killing people, it's killing our economy,\n\n26:14.460 --> 26:17.940\n it's killing lifestyles and lives.\n\n26:17.940 --> 26:19.220\n This is an obvious solution.\n\n26:19.220 --> 26:20.300\n To me, this is exciting.\n\n26:20.300 --> 26:21.760\n This is like, this is a solution.\n\n26:21.760 --> 26:25.660\n I wish like in April or something like that\n\n26:25.660 --> 26:30.660\n to launch like the larger scale manufacturing deployment\n\n26:30.860 --> 26:33.320\n of tests.\n\n26:33.320 --> 26:35.180\n Doesn't matter what test they are.\n\n26:35.180 --> 26:37.020\n It's obviously the capitalist system\n\n26:37.020 --> 26:38.940\n would create cheaper and cheaper tests\n\n26:38.940 --> 26:42.340\n that would be hopefully driving down to $1.\n\n26:42.340 --> 26:43.940\n So what are we talking about?\n\n26:43.940 --> 26:46.100\n In America, there's, I don't know,\n\n26:46.100 --> 26:49.180\n 300 plus million people.\n\n26:49.180 --> 26:53.260\n So that means you wanna be testing regularly, right?\n\n26:54.140 --> 26:57.500\n So how many do you think is possible to manufacture?\n\n26:57.500 --> 27:00.820\n What would be the ultimate goal to manufacture per month?\n\n27:00.820 --> 27:03.980\n Yep, so if we wanna slow this virus\n\n27:03.980 --> 27:05.700\n and actually stop it from transmitting,\n\n27:05.700 --> 27:07.380\n achieve what I call herd effects.\n\n27:07.380 --> 27:09.980\n Like vaccine herd immunity,\n\n27:09.980 --> 27:13.180\n herd effects are when you get that R value below one\n\n27:13.180 --> 27:14.700\n through preventing onward transmission.\n\n27:14.700 --> 27:15.980\n If we wanna do that with these tests,\n\n27:15.980 --> 27:19.060\n we need about 20 million to 40 million of them every day,\n\n27:20.580 --> 27:21.580\n which is not a lot.\n\n27:21.580 --> 27:22.420\n In the United States.\n\n27:22.420 --> 27:23.580\n In the United States.\n\n27:23.580 --> 27:24.540\n So we could do it.\n\n27:24.540 --> 27:25.360\n There's other ways.\n\n27:25.360 --> 27:29.220\n You can have two people in a household swab each other,\n\n27:29.220 --> 27:31.080\n swab themselves rather,\n\n27:31.080 --> 27:33.520\n and then mix, put the swabs into the same tube\n\n27:33.520 --> 27:35.400\n and onto one test so you can pool.\n\n27:35.400 --> 27:40.340\n So you can get a two or three X gain in efficiency\n\n27:40.340 --> 27:42.380\n through pooling in the household.\n\n27:42.380 --> 27:44.300\n You could do that in schools or offices too,\n\n27:44.300 --> 27:45.580\n wherever and just use a swab.\n\n27:45.580 --> 27:47.780\n You have a, there's two people.\n\n27:47.780 --> 27:50.240\n I mean, even if it's just standing in line\n\n27:50.240 --> 27:52.580\n at a public testing site or something,\n\n27:52.580 --> 27:53.800\n you could just say, okay,\n\n27:53.800 --> 27:57.020\n these two are the last people to test or swab themselves.\n\n27:57.020 --> 27:58.600\n They go into one thing.\n\n27:58.600 --> 27:59.940\n And if it comes back positive,\n\n27:59.940 --> 28:02.140\n then you just do each person and it's rapid.\n\n28:02.140 --> 28:05.560\n So you can just say to the people, one of you is positive.\n\n28:05.560 --> 28:06.660\n Let's test you again.\n\n28:07.960 --> 28:10.540\n So there's ways to get the efficiency gains much better.\n\n28:10.540 --> 28:13.700\n But let's say, I think that the optimal number right now\n\n28:13.700 --> 28:16.780\n that matches sort of what we can produce more or less today,\n\n28:16.780 --> 28:19.040\n if we want it, is 20 million a day.\n\n28:19.040 --> 28:20.580\n Right now, one company that,\n\n28:20.580 --> 28:21.740\n I don't have their test here,\n\n28:21.740 --> 28:24.880\n but one company is already producing 5 million tests\n\n28:24.880 --> 28:27.780\n themselves and shipping them overseas.\n\n28:27.780 --> 28:30.940\n It's an American company based in California called Inova,\n\n28:30.940 --> 28:34.980\n and they are giving 5 million tests to the UK every day.\n\n28:36.400 --> 28:39.100\n Not to the, you know, and this is just because there's no,\n\n28:39.100 --> 28:42.180\n the federal government hasn't authorized these tests.\n\n28:42.180 --> 28:44.680\n So without the support of the government.\n\n28:44.680 --> 28:46.240\n So yeah, so essentially,\n\n28:46.240 --> 28:49.220\n if the government just puts some support behind it,\n\n28:49.220 --> 28:53.980\n then yeah, you can get 20 million, probably easy.\n\n28:53.980 --> 28:55.340\n Oh yeah, this, I mean, just here,\n\n28:55.340 --> 28:57.500\n I have three different companies.\n\n28:57.500 --> 28:58.660\n These, they all look similar.\n\n28:58.660 --> 28:59.500\n Well, this one's closed,\n\n28:59.500 --> 29:02.220\n but these are three different companies right here.\n\n29:02.220 --> 29:04.020\n This is a fourth, Abbott.\n\n29:04.020 --> 29:05.580\n Now, this is a fifth.\n\n29:05.580 --> 29:07.100\n This is a sixth.\n\n29:07.100 --> 29:08.660\n These two are a little bit different.\n\n29:08.660 --> 29:10.060\n Do you mind if in a little bit,\n\n29:10.060 --> 29:11.660\n would you take some of these or?\n\n29:11.660 --> 29:12.860\n Yeah, let's do it.\n\n29:12.860 --> 29:15.540\n We can absolutely do them.\n\n29:15.540 --> 29:17.860\n So you have a lot of tests in front of you.\n\n29:17.860 --> 29:20.100\n Could you maybe explain some of them?\n\n29:20.100 --> 29:21.300\n Absolutely.\n\n29:21.300 --> 29:24.360\n So there's a few different classes of tests\n\n29:24.360 --> 29:26.040\n that I just have here, and there's more tests.\n\n29:26.040 --> 29:28.880\n There's many more different tests out in the world too.\n\n29:28.880 --> 29:31.460\n These are one class of tests.\n\n29:31.460 --> 29:33.700\n These are rapid antigen tests\n\n29:33.700 --> 29:36.780\n that are just the most bare bones paper strip tests.\n\n29:36.780 --> 29:41.780\n These are, this is the type that I wanna see produced\n\n29:42.060 --> 29:43.940\n in the tens of millions every day.\n\n29:43.940 --> 29:45.460\n It's so simple.\n\n29:45.460 --> 29:47.500\n You don't even need the plastic cartridge.\n\n29:47.500 --> 29:52.180\n You can just make the paper strip,\n\n29:52.180 --> 29:55.340\n and you could have a little tube like this\n\n29:55.340 --> 29:57.660\n that you just dunk the paper strip into.\n\n29:57.660 --> 30:00.100\n You don't actually need the plastic,\n\n30:00.100 --> 30:01.320\n which I'd actually prefer,\n\n30:01.320 --> 30:03.440\n because if we start making tens of millions of these,\n\n30:03.440 --> 30:05.340\n this becomes a lot of waste.\n\n30:05.340 --> 30:07.420\n So I'd rather not see this kind of waste be out there.\n\n30:07.420 --> 30:08.660\n And there's a few companies,\n\n30:08.660 --> 30:11.560\n Quidel is making a test called the Quick View,\n\n30:11.560 --> 30:12.880\n which is just this.\n\n30:12.880 --> 30:16.500\n It's a, they've gotten rid of all the plastic.\n\n30:16.500 --> 30:18.380\n And for people who are just listening to this,\n\n30:18.380 --> 30:20.460\n we're looking at some very small tests\n\n30:20.460 --> 30:22.260\n that fit in the palm of your hand,\n\n30:22.260 --> 30:24.300\n and they're basically paper strips\n\n30:24.300 --> 30:26.320\n fit into different containers.\n\n30:26.320 --> 30:29.620\n And that's hence the comment about the plastic containers.\n\n30:29.620 --> 30:32.140\n These are just injection molded, I think.\n\n30:32.140 --> 30:34.440\n And they're, you know,\n\n30:34.440 --> 30:36.900\n they can build them at high numbers,\n\n30:36.900 --> 30:38.940\n but then they have to like place them in there appropriately\n\n30:38.940 --> 30:39.780\n and all this stuff.\n\n30:39.780 --> 30:41.420\n So it is a bottleneck,\n\n30:41.420 --> 30:44.300\n or somewhat of a bottleneck in manufacturing.\n\n30:44.300 --> 30:47.260\n The actual bottleneck, which the government, I think,\n\n30:47.260 --> 30:49.860\n should use the Defense Productions Act to build up,\n\n30:49.860 --> 30:52.740\n is there's a nitrocellulose membrane,\n\n30:52.740 --> 30:54.480\n a laminated membrane on this,\n\n30:54.480 --> 30:57.220\n that allows the material,\n\n30:57.220 --> 31:02.220\n the buffer with the swab mixture to flow across it.\n\n31:02.320 --> 31:03.280\n So the way these work,\n\n31:03.280 --> 31:05.180\n they're called lateral flow tests.\n\n31:05.180 --> 31:07.220\n And you take a swab,\n\n31:07.220 --> 31:10.040\n you swab the front of your nose,\n\n31:10.040 --> 31:12.880\n you dunk that swab into some buffer,\n\n31:12.880 --> 31:15.540\n and then you put a couple of drops of that buffer\n\n31:15.540 --> 31:17.460\n onto the lateral flow.\n\n31:17.460 --> 31:19.060\n And just like paper,\n\n31:19.060 --> 31:21.820\n if you dip a piece of paper into a cup of water,\n\n31:21.820 --> 31:25.000\n the paper will pull the water up through capillary action.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.340\n This actually works very similarly.\n\n31:26.340 --> 31:29.700\n It flows through somewhat a capillary action\n\n31:29.700 --> 31:32.260\n through this nitrocellulose membrane.\n\n31:32.260 --> 31:33.860\n And there's little antibodies on there,\n\n31:33.860 --> 31:36.140\n these little proteins that are very specific,\n\n31:36.140 --> 31:39.380\n in this case, for antigens or proteins of the virus.\n\n31:39.380 --> 31:42.740\n So these are antibodies similar to the antibodies\n\n31:42.740 --> 31:45.660\n that our body makes from our immune system,\n\n31:45.660 --> 31:48.380\n but they're just printed on these lateral flow tests,\n\n31:48.380 --> 31:50.580\n and they're printed just like a little, a line.\n\n31:50.580 --> 31:54.580\n So then you slice these all up into individual ones.\n\n31:54.580 --> 31:56.660\n And if there's any virus on that buffer,\n\n31:56.660 --> 31:59.860\n as it flows across, the antibodies grab that virus,\n\n31:59.860 --> 32:03.220\n and it creates a little reaction with some colloids in here\n\n32:03.220 --> 32:04.900\n that cause it to turn dark.\n\n32:04.900 --> 32:06.440\n Just like a pregnancy test,\n\n32:07.420 --> 32:11.540\n one line means negative, it means a control strip worked,\n\n32:11.540 --> 32:13.060\n and two lines mean positive.\n\n32:13.060 --> 32:16.060\n It means, you know, if you get two lines,\n\n32:16.060 --> 32:17.100\n it just means you have virus there.\n\n32:17.100 --> 32:18.580\n You're very, very likely to have virus there.\n\n32:18.580 --> 32:21.520\n And so they're super simple.\n\n32:21.520 --> 32:23.900\n It is the exact same technology as pregnancy tests.\n\n32:23.900 --> 32:27.940\n It's the technology, this particular one from Abbott,\n\n32:27.940 --> 32:31.020\n this has been used for other infectious diseases\n\n32:31.020 --> 32:34.300\n like malaria, and actually a number of these companies\n\n32:34.300 --> 32:37.480\n have made malaria tests that do the exact same thing.\n\n32:37.480 --> 32:41.260\n So they just coopted the same form factor\n\n32:41.260 --> 32:43.340\n and just changed the antibodies\n\n32:43.340 --> 32:46.580\n so it picks up SARS CoV2 instead of other infections.\n\n32:46.580 --> 32:48.740\n Is it also, the Abbott one, is it also a strip?\n\n32:48.740 --> 32:51.020\n Yep, yeah, this Abbott one here is,\n\n32:51.020 --> 32:52.140\n there's the, in this case,\n\n32:52.140 --> 32:53.700\n instead of being put in a plastic sheath,\n\n32:53.700 --> 32:56.900\n it's just put in a cardboard thing and literally glued on.\n\n32:56.900 --> 32:59.780\n I mean, it looks like nothing, you know, it's just,\n\n32:59.780 --> 33:02.620\n it looks like a, like,\n\n33:02.620 --> 33:04.860\n I mean, it's just the simplest thing you could imagine.\n\n33:04.860 --> 33:07.580\n The exterior packaging looks very Apple like, it's nice.\n\n33:07.580 --> 33:09.420\n It does, yeah, yeah.\n\n33:09.420 --> 33:11.820\n Yeah, so it's nice when it comes in a,\n\n33:11.820 --> 33:14.820\n this is how they're packaged, you know,\n\n33:14.820 --> 33:17.980\n so, and they don't have to, you know,\n\n33:17.980 --> 33:20.340\n these are coming in individual packages against,\n\n33:20.340 --> 33:21.900\n again, because they're really considered\n\n33:21.900 --> 33:24.180\n individual medical devices,\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:27.020\n but you could package them in bigger packets and stuff.\n\n33:27.020 --> 33:28.740\n You wanna be careful with humidity\n\n33:28.740 --> 33:30.260\n so they all have a little,\n\n33:30.260 --> 33:33.540\n one of those humidity removing things\n\n33:33.540 --> 33:35.060\n and oxygen removing things.\n\n33:36.020 --> 33:39.940\n So that's, this is one class, these antigen tests.\n\n33:39.940 --> 33:42.580\n If we could just pause for a second, if it's okay,\n\n33:42.580 --> 33:47.580\n and could you just briefly say what is an antigen test\n\n33:47.740 --> 33:49.580\n and what other tests there are out there,\n\n33:49.580 --> 33:50.900\n like categories of tests?\n\n33:50.900 --> 33:51.740\n Sure.\n\n33:51.740 --> 33:52.700\n Just really quick.\n\n33:52.700 --> 33:55.180\n So the testing landscape is a little bit complicated,\n\n33:55.180 --> 33:56.900\n but it's, but I'll break it down.\n\n33:56.900 --> 34:00.060\n There's really just three major classes of tests.\n\n34:00.900 --> 34:02.780\n We'll start with the first two.\n\n34:02.780 --> 34:06.300\n The first two tests are just looking for the virus\n\n34:06.300 --> 34:10.060\n or looking for antibodies against the virus.\n\n34:10.060 --> 34:12.540\n So we've heard about serology tests,\n\n34:12.540 --> 34:14.540\n or maybe some people have heard about it.\n\n34:14.540 --> 34:15.860\n Those are a different kind of test.\n\n34:15.860 --> 34:19.220\n They're looking to see has somebody in the past,\n\n34:19.220 --> 34:21.460\n does somebody have an immune response against the virus,\n\n34:21.460 --> 34:23.220\n which would indicate that they were infected\n\n34:23.220 --> 34:24.740\n or exposed to it.\n\n34:24.740 --> 34:26.780\n So we're not talking about the antibody tests.\n\n34:26.780 --> 34:27.820\n I'll just leave it at that.\n\n34:27.820 --> 34:31.740\n Those, they actually can look very similar to this,\n\n34:31.740 --> 34:35.380\n or they can be done in a laboratory.\n\n34:35.380 --> 34:37.580\n Those are usually done from blood\n\n34:37.580 --> 34:40.580\n and they're looking for an immune response to the virus.\n\n34:40.580 --> 34:41.740\n So that's one.\n\n34:41.740 --> 34:43.020\n Everything I'm talking about here\n\n34:43.020 --> 34:44.660\n is looking for the virus itself,\n\n34:44.660 --> 34:46.940\n not the immune response to the virus.\n\n34:46.940 --> 34:49.100\n And so there's two ways to look for the virus.\n\n34:49.100 --> 34:51.300\n You can either look for the genetic code of the virus,\n\n34:51.300 --> 34:55.460\n like the RNA, just like the DNA of somebody's human cells,\n\n34:55.460 --> 34:57.380\n or you can look for the proteins themselves,\n\n34:57.380 --> 34:59.740\n the antigens of the virus.\n\n34:59.740 --> 35:02.380\n So I like to differentiate them.\n\n35:02.380 --> 35:07.380\n If you were a PCR test that looks for RNA in,\n\n35:08.740 --> 35:10.900\n let's say if we made it against humans,\n\n35:10.900 --> 35:13.060\n it would be looking for the DNA inside of our cells.\n\n35:13.060 --> 35:15.660\n That would be actually looking for our genetic code.\n\n35:16.500 --> 35:19.060\n The equivalent to an antigen test\n\n35:19.060 --> 35:21.980\n is sort of a test that like actually is looking\n\n35:21.980 --> 35:25.420\n for our eyes or our nose or physical features of our body\n\n35:25.420 --> 35:30.420\n that would delineate, okay, this is Michael, for example.\n\n35:30.420 --> 35:33.620\n And so you're either looking for a sequence\n\n35:33.620 --> 35:35.940\n or you're looking for a structure.\n\n35:35.940 --> 35:38.620\n The PCR tests that a lot of people have gotten now\n\n35:38.620 --> 35:40.620\n and they're done in labs usually\n\n35:40.620 --> 35:43.620\n are looking for the sequence of the virus, which is RNA.\n\n35:43.620 --> 35:46.940\n This test here by a company called Detect,\n\n35:46.940 --> 35:49.340\n this is one of Jonathan Rothberg's companies.\n\n35:50.380 --> 35:54.180\n He's the guy who helped create modern day sequencing\n\n35:54.180 --> 35:56.020\n and all kinds of other things.\n\n35:56.020 --> 35:58.820\n So this Detect device, that's the name of the company,\n\n35:58.820 --> 36:01.980\n this is actually a rapid RNA detection device.\n\n36:01.980 --> 36:04.140\n So it's almost, it's like a PCR like test\n\n36:04.140 --> 36:06.100\n and we could even do it here.\n\n36:06.100 --> 36:09.100\n It's really, it's a beautiful test in my opinion,\n\n36:09.100 --> 36:10.940\n works exceedingly well.\n\n36:10.940 --> 36:12.380\n It's gonna be a little bit more expensive.\n\n36:12.380 --> 36:14.180\n So I think it could confirm,\n\n36:14.180 --> 36:16.460\n could be used as a confirmatory test for these.\n\n36:16.460 --> 36:18.140\n Is there a greater accuracy to it?\n\n36:19.740 --> 36:21.780\n Yes, I would say that there is a greater accuracy.\n\n36:21.780 --> 36:23.940\n There's also a downfall though of PCR\n\n36:23.940 --> 36:26.460\n and tests that look for RNA.\n\n36:26.460 --> 36:29.940\n They can sometimes detect somebody\n\n36:29.940 --> 36:32.340\n who is no longer infectious.\n\n36:32.340 --> 36:33.900\n So you have the RNA test\n\n36:33.900 --> 36:35.780\n and then you have these antigen tests.\n\n36:35.780 --> 36:37.860\n The antigen tests look for structures,\n\n36:37.860 --> 36:40.580\n but they're generally only going to turn positive\n\n36:40.580 --> 36:43.580\n if people have actively replicating virus in them.\n\n36:43.580 --> 36:48.260\n And so what happens after an infection dissipates,\n\n36:48.260 --> 36:51.260\n you've just gone from having sort of a spike.\n\n36:51.260 --> 36:53.500\n So if you get infected, maybe three days later,\n\n36:53.500 --> 36:56.220\n the virus gets into exponential growth\n\n36:56.220 --> 36:59.060\n and it can replicate to trillions of viruses\n\n36:59.060 --> 37:00.820\n inside the body.\n\n37:00.820 --> 37:02.900\n Your immune system then kind of tackles it\n\n37:02.900 --> 37:04.900\n and beats it down to nothing.\n\n37:04.900 --> 37:07.180\n But what ends up in the wake of that,\n\n37:07.180 --> 37:08.020\n you just had a battle.\n\n37:08.020 --> 37:10.340\n You had this massive battle that just took place\n\n37:10.340 --> 37:12.900\n inside your upper respiratory tract.\n\n37:12.900 --> 37:16.180\n And because of that, you've had trillions and trillions\n\n37:16.180 --> 37:19.660\n of viruses go to zero, essentially.\n\n37:19.660 --> 37:21.540\n But the RNA is still there.\n\n37:21.540 --> 37:23.020\n It's just these remnants.\n\n37:23.020 --> 37:24.820\n In the same way that if you go to a crime scene\n\n37:24.820 --> 37:28.820\n and blood was sort of spread all over the crime scene,\n\n37:28.820 --> 37:30.740\n you're going to find a lot of DNA.\n\n37:30.740 --> 37:31.580\n There's tons of DNA.\n\n37:31.580 --> 37:35.220\n There's no people anymore, but there's a lot of DNA there.\n\n37:35.220 --> 37:36.340\n Same thing happens here.\n\n37:36.340 --> 37:38.660\n And so what's happening with PCR testing\n\n37:38.660 --> 37:42.460\n is when people go and use these exceedingly high sensitivity\n\n37:42.460 --> 37:46.820\n PCR tests, people will stay positive for weeks or months\n\n37:46.820 --> 37:49.700\n after their infection has subsided,\n\n37:49.700 --> 37:51.540\n which has caused a lot of problems, in my opinion.\n\n37:51.540 --> 37:54.900\n It's problems that the CDC and the FDA and doctors\n\n37:54.900 --> 37:56.780\n don't want to deal with.\n\n37:56.780 --> 37:58.140\n But I've tried to publish on it.\n\n37:58.140 --> 38:01.660\n I've tried to suggest that this is an issue,\n\n38:01.660 --> 38:02.980\n both to New York Times and others.\n\n38:02.980 --> 38:04.620\n And now it's unfortunately kind of taken\n\n38:04.620 --> 38:06.700\n on a life of its own of conspiracy theorists\n\n38:06.700 --> 38:10.020\n thinking that they call it a case demic.\n\n38:10.020 --> 38:13.420\n They say, oh, you know, PCR is detecting people\n\n38:13.420 --> 38:16.020\n who are no longer, who are false positive.\n\n38:16.020 --> 38:17.340\n They're not false positives.\n\n38:17.340 --> 38:20.780\n They're late positives, no longer transmissible.\n\n38:20.780 --> 38:25.100\n I think the way you, like what I saw in rapidtest.org,\n\n38:25.100 --> 38:27.180\n I really liked the distinction between diagnostic\n\n38:27.180 --> 38:30.060\n sensitivity and contagiousness sensitivity.\n\n38:30.060 --> 38:35.060\n That's, it's so, that website is so obvious\n\n38:36.380 --> 38:38.220\n that it's painful because it's like, yeah,\n\n38:38.220 --> 38:41.020\n that's what we should be talking about is\n\n38:41.020 --> 38:46.020\n how accurately is a test able to detect your contagiousness?\n\n38:46.260 --> 38:48.980\n And you have different plots that show that actually\n\n38:48.980 --> 38:52.780\n there's, you know, that antigen tests,\n\n38:52.780 --> 38:55.540\n the tests we're looking at today, like rapid tests,\n\n38:55.540 --> 38:58.460\n are actually really good at detecting contagiousness.\n\n38:58.460 --> 38:59.300\n Absolutely.\n\n38:59.300 --> 39:02.420\n It all mixes back with this whole idea that,\n\n39:02.420 --> 39:04.500\n of the medical industrial complex.\n\n39:04.500 --> 39:07.540\n You know, in this country, and in most countries,\n\n39:07.540 --> 39:10.900\n we have almost entirely defunded\n\n39:10.900 --> 39:13.900\n and devalued public health, period.\n\n39:13.900 --> 39:15.660\n You know, we just have.\n\n39:15.660 --> 39:20.060\n And what that means is that we don't even,\n\n39:20.060 --> 39:22.100\n we don't have a language for it.\n\n39:22.100 --> 39:23.340\n We don't have a lexicon for it.\n\n39:23.340 --> 39:25.860\n We don't have a regulatory landscape for it.\n\n39:25.860 --> 39:30.140\n And so the only window we have to look at a test today\n\n39:30.140 --> 39:32.780\n is as a medical diagnostic test.\n\n39:32.780 --> 39:37.060\n And that becomes very problematic when we're trying\n\n39:37.060 --> 39:40.100\n to tackle a public health threat\n\n39:40.100 --> 39:42.100\n and a public health emergency.\n\n39:42.100 --> 39:44.660\n By definition, this is a public health emergency\n\n39:44.660 --> 39:45.900\n that we're in.\n\n39:45.900 --> 39:48.820\n And yet we keep evaluating tests\n\n39:48.820 --> 39:52.780\n as though the diagnostic benchmark is the gold standard.\n\n39:52.780 --> 39:55.660\n Where if I'm a physician, I am a physician,\n\n39:55.660 --> 39:59.260\n so I'll put on that physician hat for a moment.\n\n39:59.260 --> 40:01.740\n And if I have a patient who comes to me\n\n40:01.740 --> 40:06.740\n and wants to know if their symptoms are a result of them\n\n40:06.740 --> 40:10.060\n having COVID, then I want every shred of evidence\n\n40:10.060 --> 40:12.780\n that I can get to see, does this person currently\n\n40:12.780 --> 40:17.260\n or did they recently have this infection inside of them?\n\n40:17.260 --> 40:21.220\n And so in that sense, the PCR test is the perfect test.\n\n40:21.220 --> 40:22.940\n It's really sensitive.\n\n40:22.940 --> 40:25.100\n It will find the RNA if it's there at all\n\n40:25.100 --> 40:26.940\n so that I could say, you know, yeah,\n\n40:26.940 --> 40:28.820\n you have a low amount of RNA left.\n\n40:28.820 --> 40:30.860\n You might've been, you said your symptoms\n\n40:30.860 --> 40:32.380\n started two weeks ago.\n\n40:32.380 --> 40:36.100\n You probably were infectious two weeks ago\n\n40:36.100 --> 40:38.980\n and you have lingering symptoms from it.\n\n40:38.980 --> 40:41.540\n But that's a medical diagnosis.\n\n40:41.540 --> 40:44.580\n It's kind of like a detective recreating a crime scene.\n\n40:44.580 --> 40:48.420\n They wanna go back there and recreate the pieces\n\n40:48.420 --> 40:52.860\n so that they can assign blame or whatever it might be.\n\n40:52.860 --> 40:53.820\n But that's not public health.\n\n40:53.820 --> 40:56.020\n In public health, we need to only look forward.\n\n40:56.020 --> 40:57.260\n We don't wanna go back and say,\n\n40:57.260 --> 40:59.540\n well, was this person, are there symptoms\n\n40:59.540 --> 41:01.780\n because they had an infection two weeks ago?\n\n41:01.780 --> 41:04.820\n In public health, we just wanna stop the virus\n\n41:04.820 --> 41:06.260\n from spreading to the next person.\n\n41:06.260 --> 41:08.900\n And so that's where we don't care\n\n41:08.900 --> 41:11.620\n if somebody was infected two weeks ago.\n\n41:11.620 --> 41:13.580\n We only care about finding the people\n\n41:13.580 --> 41:15.860\n who are infectious today.\n\n41:15.860 --> 41:19.780\n And unfortunately, our regulatory landscape\n\n41:19.780 --> 41:23.860\n fails to apply that knowledge\n\n41:23.860 --> 41:26.100\n to evaluate these tests as public health tools.\n\n41:26.100 --> 41:29.220\n They're only evaluating the tests as medical tools.\n\n41:29.220 --> 41:32.660\n And therefore, we get all kinds of complaints\n\n41:32.660 --> 41:37.540\n that say this test, which detects 99 plus,\n\n41:37.540 --> 41:41.460\n 99.8% of current infectious people,\n\n41:43.620 --> 41:45.340\n by the FDA's rubric, they'll say,\n\n41:45.340 --> 41:48.460\n no, no, it's only 50% sensitive.\n\n41:48.460 --> 41:50.460\n And that's because when you go out into the world\n\n41:50.460 --> 41:53.620\n and you just compare this against PCR positivity,\n\n41:53.620 --> 41:56.820\n most people who are PCR positive in the world right now\n\n41:56.820 --> 42:00.500\n at any given time are post infectious.\n\n42:00.500 --> 42:01.660\n They're no longer infectious\n\n42:01.660 --> 42:04.940\n because you might only be infectious for five days,\n\n42:04.940 --> 42:06.700\n but then you'll remain PCR positive\n\n42:06.700 --> 42:09.180\n for three or four or five weeks.\n\n42:09.180 --> 42:11.340\n And so when you go and just evaluate these tests\n\n42:11.340 --> 42:13.980\n and you say, okay, this person's PCR positive,\n\n42:13.980 --> 42:17.140\n does the rapid antigen test detect that?\n\n42:17.140 --> 42:19.020\n More often than not, it's no.\n\n42:19.020 --> 42:23.020\n But that's because those people don't need isolation.\n\n42:23.020 --> 42:24.100\n They're post infectious.\n\n42:24.100 --> 42:27.780\n And it's become much more of a problem\n\n42:27.780 --> 42:31.300\n than I think even the FDA themself is recognizing\n\n42:31.300 --> 42:33.500\n because they are unwilling at this point\n\n42:33.500 --> 42:37.100\n to look at this as a public health problem\n\n42:37.100 --> 42:38.820\n requiring public health tools.\n\n42:38.820 --> 42:41.060\n We'll definitely talk about this a little bit more\n\n42:41.060 --> 42:43.380\n because the concern I have is that\n\n42:43.380 --> 42:45.340\n a bigger pandemic comes along.\n\n42:45.340 --> 42:47.100\n What are the lessons we draw from this\n\n42:47.100 --> 42:48.020\n and how we move forward?\n\n42:48.020 --> 42:50.060\n Let's talk about that in a bit.\n\n42:50.060 --> 42:55.060\n But sort of, can we discuss further the lay of the land here\n\n42:55.220 --> 42:56.940\n of the different tests before us?\n\n42:56.940 --> 42:57.780\n Absolutely.\n\n42:57.780 --> 43:00.900\n So I talked about PCR tests and those are done in the lab\n\n43:00.900 --> 43:05.180\n or they're done essentially with a rapid test like this,\n\n43:05.180 --> 43:07.820\n the detect, and we can even try this in a moment.\n\n43:07.820 --> 43:09.380\n It goes into a little heater.\n\n43:09.380 --> 43:11.340\n So you might have one of these in a household\n\n43:11.340 --> 43:14.420\n or one of these in a nursing home or something like that\n\n43:14.420 --> 43:15.340\n or in an airport.\n\n43:16.460 --> 43:19.380\n Or you could have one that has 100 different outlets.\n\n43:19.380 --> 43:21.340\n This is just to heat the tube up.\n\n43:21.340 --> 43:22.620\n These are the rapid tests.\n\n43:22.620 --> 43:25.620\n They're super simple, no frills.\n\n43:25.620 --> 43:30.620\n You just swab your nose and you put the swab into a buffer\n\n43:30.860 --> 43:32.180\n and you put the buffer on the test.\n\n43:32.180 --> 43:34.340\n So we can use these right now if you want.\n\n43:34.340 --> 43:35.180\n We can try it out.\n\n43:35.180 --> 43:36.820\n And all the tests we're talking about,\n\n43:36.820 --> 43:39.900\n they're usually swabbing the nose.\n\n43:39.900 --> 43:41.100\n Like that's the...\n\n43:41.100 --> 43:43.220\n That's still the main, yeah.\n\n43:43.220 --> 43:45.940\n There are some saliva tests coming about\n\n43:45.940 --> 43:48.180\n and these can all work potentially with saliva.\n\n43:48.180 --> 43:50.180\n They just have to be recalibrated.\n\n43:50.180 --> 43:52.740\n But these swabs are really not bad.\n\n43:52.740 --> 43:57.180\n This isn't the deep swab that goes like way back\n\n43:57.180 --> 43:58.380\n into your nose or anything.\n\n43:58.380 --> 44:01.900\n This is just a swab that you do yourself\n\n44:01.900 --> 44:03.820\n like right in the front of your nose.\n\n44:03.820 --> 44:04.660\n So if you wanna do it.\n\n44:04.660 --> 44:05.620\n Yeah, do you mind if I?\n\n44:05.620 --> 44:06.820\n Sure, yeah.\n\n44:06.820 --> 44:08.140\n Yeah, why don't we start with this one?\n\n44:08.140 --> 44:10.660\n Because this is Abbott's Buy Next Now test\n\n44:10.660 --> 44:12.620\n and it's really, it's pretty simple.\n\n44:12.620 --> 44:15.740\n This is the swab from the Abbott test.\n\n44:15.740 --> 44:16.580\n That's correct.\n\n44:16.580 --> 44:18.420\n That's the swab from the Abbott test.\n\n44:18.420 --> 44:21.500\n So what I'm gonna do to start\n\n44:21.500 --> 44:23.980\n is I'm going to take this buffer here,\n\n44:23.980 --> 44:26.340\n which is, this is just the buffer\n\n44:26.340 --> 44:27.940\n that goes onto this test.\n\n44:27.940 --> 44:28.780\n So this is a brand new one.\n\n44:28.780 --> 44:30.780\n I just opened this test out.\n\n44:32.100 --> 44:34.820\n I'm gonna just take six drops of this buffer\n\n44:34.820 --> 44:36.940\n and put it right onto this test here.\n\n44:40.020 --> 44:43.540\n Two, three, four, five, six.\n\n44:43.540 --> 44:44.380\n Okay.\n\n44:44.380 --> 44:46.900\n And now you're gonna take that swab, open it up.\n\n44:48.100 --> 44:50.940\n Yep, and now just wipe it around inside the,\n\n44:50.940 --> 44:52.380\n into the front of your nose.\n\n44:52.380 --> 44:54.900\n Do a few circles on each nostril.\n\n44:58.260 --> 44:59.100\n That looks good.\n\n45:03.660 --> 45:05.380\n This always makes me wanna sneeze.\n\n45:05.380 --> 45:06.220\n Yeah.\n\n45:07.100 --> 45:09.540\n Okay, now I'm gonna have you do it yourself.\n\n45:11.860 --> 45:13.500\n I'm getting emotional.\n\n45:13.500 --> 45:14.940\n Hold it parallel to the test.\n\n45:14.940 --> 45:16.260\n So put the test down on the table.\n\n45:16.260 --> 45:19.020\n Yep, and then go into that bottom hole.\n\n45:19.020 --> 45:20.180\n Yep, and push forward\n\n45:20.180 --> 45:22.820\n so that you can start to see it in the other hole.\n\n45:22.820 --> 45:23.660\n There you go.\n\n45:23.660 --> 45:26.460\n Now turn, if it's, once it hits up against the top,\n\n45:26.460 --> 45:28.060\n just turn it three times.\n\n45:28.060 --> 45:30.980\n One, two, three, and sort of, yep.\n\n45:30.980 --> 45:32.980\n And now you just close,\n\n45:32.980 --> 45:35.300\n so pull off that adhesive sticker there.\n\n45:37.140 --> 45:39.060\n And now you just close the whole thing.\n\n45:41.460 --> 45:42.820\n And.\n\n45:42.820 --> 45:43.980\n And that's it.\n\n45:43.980 --> 45:44.820\n That's it.\n\n45:44.820 --> 45:46.180\n Now what we will see\n\n45:46.180 --> 45:49.180\n is we will see a line form.\n\n45:49.180 --> 45:53.140\n What's happening now is the buffer that you put in there\n\n45:53.140 --> 45:58.140\n is now moving up onto the paper strip test,\n\n45:58.820 --> 46:02.820\n and it has the material from the swab in there.\n\n46:02.820 --> 46:05.420\n And so what we'll see is a line will form,\n\n46:05.420 --> 46:07.340\n and that's gonna be the control line.\n\n46:08.220 --> 46:11.540\n And then we'll also see the,\n\n46:11.540 --> 46:14.940\n ideally we'll see no line for the actual line.\n\n46:14.940 --> 46:17.660\n We'll see no line for the actual test line.\n\n46:17.660 --> 46:20.300\n And that's because you should be negative.\n\n46:20.300 --> 46:24.260\n So one line will be positive and two lines will be negative.\n\n46:24.260 --> 46:25.100\n That's very cool.\n\n46:25.100 --> 46:27.420\n There's this purple thing creeping up\n\n46:28.860 --> 46:30.500\n onto the control line.\n\n46:31.740 --> 46:32.580\n That's perfect.\n\n46:32.580 --> 46:34.140\n That's what you wanna be seeing.\n\n46:35.300 --> 46:36.780\n So you want to see that,\n\n46:37.860 --> 46:41.220\n so right now you essentially want to see\n\n46:41.220 --> 46:45.740\n that that blue line turns pink or purply color.\n\n46:45.740 --> 46:49.220\n There's a blue line that's already there printed.\n\n46:49.220 --> 46:52.660\n It should turn sort of a purple pink color.\n\n46:52.660 --> 46:57.660\n And ideally there will be no additional line for the sample.\n\n47:00.620 --> 47:02.260\n And if there is,\n\n47:02.260 --> 47:06.700\n that's the 99 point whatever percent accuracy on,\n\n47:06.700 --> 47:09.140\n that means I have, I'm contagious.\n\n47:09.140 --> 47:11.180\n That would mean that you're likely contagious\n\n47:11.180 --> 47:14.220\n or you likely have infectious virus in you.\n\n47:14.220 --> 47:15.060\n What we can do,\n\n47:15.060 --> 47:19.500\n because one of the things that my plan calls for\n\n47:19.500 --> 47:21.540\n is because sometimes these tests\n\n47:21.540 --> 47:24.620\n can get false positive results, it's rare.\n\n47:24.620 --> 47:27.620\n Maybe 1% or in the case of this Binex now,\n\n47:27.620 --> 47:30.180\n this Abbott test 0.1%.\n\n47:30.180 --> 47:31.940\n So one in a thousand, one in 500,\n\n47:31.940 --> 47:34.420\n something like that can be falsely positive.\n\n47:34.420 --> 47:38.060\n What I recommend is that when somebody is positive\n\n47:38.060 --> 47:39.300\n on one of these,\n\n47:39.300 --> 47:41.300\n you turn around and you immediately test\n\n47:41.300 --> 47:42.380\n on a different test.\n\n47:42.380 --> 47:43.420\n You could either do it on the same,\n\n47:43.420 --> 47:45.620\n but for good measure,\n\n47:45.620 --> 47:48.220\n you want to use a separate test\n\n47:48.220 --> 47:51.380\n that is somewhat orthogonal,\n\n47:51.380 --> 47:54.180\n meaning that it shouldn't turn falsely positive\n\n47:54.180 --> 47:56.100\n for the same reason.\n\n47:56.100 --> 47:58.140\n This particular test here,\n\n47:58.140 --> 48:02.020\n this detect test because it is looking for the RNA\n\n48:02.020 --> 48:03.580\n and not the antigen,\n\n48:03.580 --> 48:05.740\n this is an amazingly accurate test\n\n48:05.740 --> 48:09.420\n and it's sort of a perfect gold standard\n\n48:09.420 --> 48:12.780\n or confirmatory test for any of these antigen tests.\n\n48:12.780 --> 48:14.820\n So one of the recommendations that I've had,\n\n48:14.820 --> 48:17.820\n especially if people start using antigen tests\n\n48:17.820 --> 48:20.100\n before you get onto a plane\n\n48:20.100 --> 48:22.860\n or as what I call entrance screening,\n\n48:22.860 --> 48:24.620\n if somebody is positive,\n\n48:24.620 --> 48:26.380\n you don't immediately tell them,\n\n48:26.380 --> 48:28.740\n you're positive, go isolate for 10 days.\n\n48:28.740 --> 48:31.980\n You tell them, let's confirm on one of these,\n\n48:31.980 --> 48:33.260\n on a detect test.\n\n48:33.260 --> 48:36.660\n That is because it's completely orthogonal,\n\n48:36.660 --> 48:39.420\n it's looking for the RNA instead of the antigen.\n\n48:40.420 --> 48:43.580\n There's no reason, no biological reason\n\n48:43.580 --> 48:46.340\n that both of these should be falsely positive.\n\n48:47.500 --> 48:50.540\n So if one's falsely positive and the other one is negative,\n\n48:50.540 --> 48:52.780\n especially because this one's more sensitive,\n\n48:53.740 --> 48:56.940\n then I would trust this as a confirmatory test.\n\n48:56.940 --> 49:00.420\n If this one's negative, then the antigen test\n\n49:00.420 --> 49:02.220\n would be considered falsely positive.\n\n49:02.220 --> 49:04.180\n It does look like there's only a single line,\n\n49:04.180 --> 49:05.580\n so this is very exciting news.\n\n49:05.580 --> 49:06.500\n That's right, yep.\n\n49:06.500 --> 49:10.940\n It says wait 15 minutes to see both lines,\n\n49:10.940 --> 49:14.100\n but in general, if somebody's really gonna be positive,\n\n49:14.100 --> 49:17.180\n that line starts showing up within a minute or two.\n\n49:17.180 --> 49:18.420\n So you wanna keep the whole,\n\n49:18.420 --> 49:20.380\n we'll keep watching it for the whole 15 minutes\n\n49:20.380 --> 49:22.740\n as it's sitting there, but I would say\n\n49:22.740 --> 49:25.740\n you're knowing that you've had PCR tests recently\n\n49:25.740 --> 49:26.900\n and all that.\n\n49:26.900 --> 49:27.980\n The odds are pretty good.\n\n49:27.980 --> 49:28.820\n The odds are very good.\n\n49:28.820 --> 49:30.780\n The packaging, very iPhone like.\n\n49:30.780 --> 49:33.660\n I'm digging the sexy packaging.\n\n49:33.660 --> 49:36.020\n I'm a sucker for good packaging, okay.\n\n49:36.020 --> 49:37.740\n So then there's this test here,\n\n49:37.740 --> 49:41.500\n which is, this is another, it's funny.\n\n49:41.500 --> 49:42.860\n Let me open this up and show you.\n\n49:42.860 --> 49:44.300\n This is a really nice test.\n\n49:44.300 --> 49:45.620\n It's another antigen test.\n\n49:45.620 --> 49:48.220\n Works the exact same way as this, essentially,\n\n49:48.220 --> 49:51.100\n but what you can see is it's got lights in it\n\n49:51.100 --> 49:52.260\n and a power button and stuff.\n\n49:52.260 --> 49:57.260\n This is called an allume test, which is fine,\n\n49:57.980 --> 49:59.900\n and it's a really nice test, to be honest,\n\n49:59.900 --> 50:04.020\n but it has to pair with an iPhone.\n\n50:04.020 --> 50:05.660\n And so it's good as a,\n\n50:05.660 --> 50:07.580\n I think that this is gonna become,\n\n50:08.740 --> 50:11.740\n there's a lot of use for this from a medical perspective,\n\n50:11.740 --> 50:13.020\n where you want good reporting.\n\n50:13.020 --> 50:15.940\n This can, because it pairs with an iPhone,\n\n50:15.940 --> 50:19.380\n it can immediately send the report\n\n50:19.380 --> 50:20.420\n to a department of health,\n\n50:20.420 --> 50:23.340\n whereas these paper strip tests, they're just paper.\n\n50:23.340 --> 50:26.580\n They don't report anything unless you wanna report it.\n\n50:26.580 --> 50:28.860\n Okay, so I'm gonna just pick it apart.\n\n50:28.860 --> 50:32.180\n And so you can see is there's fluorescent readers\n\n50:32.180 --> 50:34.700\n and little lasers and LEDs and stuff in there.\n\n50:34.700 --> 50:37.140\n You can actually see the lights going off.\n\n50:37.140 --> 50:39.380\n And there's a paper strip test right inside there,\n\n50:39.380 --> 50:41.380\n but you can see that there's a whole circuit board\n\n50:41.380 --> 50:44.380\n and all this stuff, right?\n\n50:44.380 --> 50:48.100\n And so this is the kind of thing\n\n50:48.100 --> 50:50.420\n that the FDA is looking for,\n\n50:52.340 --> 50:54.780\n for home use and things like that,\n\n50:54.780 --> 50:56.420\n because it's kind of foolproof.\n\n50:56.420 --> 50:58.340\n You can't go wrong with it.\n\n50:58.340 --> 51:00.580\n It pairs with an iPhone, so you need Bluetooth.\n\n51:00.580 --> 51:01.780\n So it's gonna be more limited.\n\n51:01.780 --> 51:03.180\n It's a great test, don't get me wrong.\n\n51:03.180 --> 51:05.220\n It's as good as any of these.\n\n51:05.220 --> 51:08.420\n But when you compare this thing with a battery\n\n51:08.420 --> 51:10.900\n and a circuit board and all this stuff,\n\n51:10.900 --> 51:14.100\n it's got its purpose, but it's not a public health tool.\n\n51:14.100 --> 51:17.020\n I don't wanna see this made in the tens of millions a day\n\n51:17.020 --> 51:17.940\n and thrown away.\n\n51:18.860 --> 51:19.700\n This is just.\n\n51:19.700 --> 51:20.540\n But FDA likes that kind of stuff.\n\n51:20.540 --> 51:22.020\n FDA loves this stuff,\n\n51:22.020 --> 51:23.980\n because they can't get it out of their mind\n\n51:23.980 --> 51:26.020\n that this is a public health crisis.\n\n51:26.020 --> 51:29.340\n We need, I mean, just look at the difference here.\n\n51:29.340 --> 51:32.060\n Something with flashing lights is essential.\n\n51:32.060 --> 51:34.020\n It's got batteries, it's got a Bluetooth thing.\n\n51:34.020 --> 51:36.620\n It's a great test, but to be honest,\n\n51:36.620 --> 51:39.780\n it's not any better than this one.\n\n51:39.780 --> 51:42.460\n And so I want this one.\n\n51:43.380 --> 51:44.380\n It's nice and all.\n\n51:44.380 --> 51:46.460\n The form factor is nice,\n\n51:46.460 --> 51:49.020\n and it's really nice that it goes to Bluetooth.\n\n51:49.020 --> 51:52.980\n But it goes against the principle of just 20 million a day.\n\n51:52.980 --> 51:54.900\n The easy solution, everybody has it.\n\n51:54.900 --> 51:57.580\n You can manufacture and probably,\n\n51:57.580 --> 52:00.060\n you could've probably scaled this up in a couple of weeks.\n\n52:00.060 --> 52:00.900\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n52:00.900 --> 52:04.220\n These companies, I mean, the rest of the world has these.\n\n52:04.220 --> 52:05.300\n They can be scaled up.\n\n52:05.300 --> 52:06.700\n They already exist.\n\n52:06.700 --> 52:08.100\n You know, SD biosensors,\n\n52:08.100 --> 52:10.460\n one company's making tens of millions a day,\n\n52:10.460 --> 52:11.860\n not coming to the United States,\n\n52:11.860 --> 52:13.420\n but going all over Europe,\n\n52:13.420 --> 52:16.980\n going all over Southeast Asia and East Asia.\n\n52:16.980 --> 52:17.900\n So they exist.\n\n52:17.900 --> 52:21.100\n The US is just, you know, we can't get out of our own way.\n\n52:21.100 --> 52:22.380\n I wonder why somebody,\n\n52:22.380 --> 52:23.620\n I don't know if you were paying attention,\n\n52:23.620 --> 52:26.860\n but somebody like an Elon Musk type character.\n\n52:26.860 --> 52:28.460\n So he was really into doing\n\n52:28.460 --> 52:30.580\n some like obvious engineering solution,\n\n52:30.580 --> 52:33.980\n like this at home rapid test\n\n52:33.980 --> 52:37.220\n seems like a very Elon Musk thing to do.\n\n52:37.220 --> 52:38.140\n I don't know if you saw,\n\n52:38.140 --> 52:41.820\n but I had a little Twitter conversation with Elon Musk.\n\n52:41.820 --> 52:43.420\n Does he not like, what is he,\n\n52:43.420 --> 52:45.500\n do you know what his thoughts are on rapid testing?\n\n52:45.500 --> 52:47.180\n Well, he was using a slightly different one,\n\n52:47.180 --> 52:49.180\n one of these, but that requires an instrument\n\n52:49.180 --> 52:50.860\n called the BD Veritor.\n\n52:50.860 --> 52:52.020\n And he got a false positive,\n\n52:52.020 --> 52:53.020\n or no, I shouldn't say,\n\n52:53.020 --> 52:54.580\n he didn't necessarily get a false positive.\n\n52:54.580 --> 52:55.900\n He got discrepant results.\n\n52:55.900 --> 52:57.860\n He did this test four times.\n\n52:57.860 --> 52:59.700\n He got two positives, two negatives,\n\n53:00.780 --> 53:02.260\n but then he got a PCR test\n\n53:02.260 --> 53:05.020\n and it was a very low positive result.\n\n53:05.020 --> 53:07.940\n So I think what happened is he just tested himself\n\n53:07.940 --> 53:09.060\n at the tail end of an,\n\n53:09.060 --> 53:11.060\n this was actually right before he was about to send those.\n\n53:11.060 --> 53:12.700\n It was the day of essentially that he was sending\n\n53:12.700 --> 53:15.060\n the astronauts up to the space station the other day.\n\n53:15.060 --> 53:17.740\n So he was using these rapid tests\n\n53:17.740 --> 53:20.020\n cause he wanted to make sure that he was good to go in\n\n53:20.020 --> 53:23.100\n and he got discrepant results.\n\n53:23.100 --> 53:25.140\n Ultimately they were correct,\n\n53:25.140 --> 53:26.860\n but two were negative, two were positive.\n\n53:26.860 --> 53:30.660\n But what really happened once he shared his PCR results\n\n53:30.660 --> 53:32.820\n and they were very low positive.\n\n53:32.820 --> 53:34.540\n So really what was happening is,\n\n53:34.540 --> 53:37.100\n my guess is he found himself right at the edge\n\n53:37.100 --> 53:39.900\n of his positivity, of his infectiousness.\n\n53:39.900 --> 53:42.500\n And so the test worked how it was supposed to work.\n\n53:42.500 --> 53:45.740\n It probably had he used it two days earlier,\n\n53:45.740 --> 53:47.420\n it would have been screaming positive.\n\n53:47.420 --> 53:49.460\n He wouldn't have gotten discrepant results,\n\n53:49.460 --> 53:51.140\n but he found himself right at the edge\n\n53:51.140 --> 53:52.780\n by the time he used the test.\n\n53:52.780 --> 53:55.060\n So the PCR would always pick it up\n\n53:55.060 --> 53:57.340\n cause it's still, cause that will still stay positive\n\n53:57.340 --> 53:59.100\n then for weeks potentially.\n\n53:59.100 --> 54:02.660\n But the rapid antigen test was starting to falter,\n\n54:02.660 --> 54:03.740\n not in a bad way,\n\n54:03.740 --> 54:06.860\n but just he probably was really no longer\n\n54:06.860 --> 54:07.860\n particularly infectious.\n\n54:07.860 --> 54:10.740\n And so it was kind of when it gets to be a very low viral\n\n54:10.740 --> 54:12.740\n load, it becomes stochastic.\n\n54:12.740 --> 54:14.380\n It's fascinating this duality.\n\n54:14.380 --> 54:18.420\n So one you can think from an individual perspective,\n\n54:18.420 --> 54:23.060\n it's unclear when you take four and half are positive,\n\n54:23.060 --> 54:25.660\n half are negative, like what are you supposed to do?\n\n54:25.660 --> 54:28.100\n But from a societal perspective,\n\n54:28.100 --> 54:30.900\n it seems like if just one of them is positive,\n\n54:30.900 --> 54:34.580\n just stay home for a couple of days, for a while.\n\n54:34.580 --> 54:36.180\n So when you're a CEO of a company,\n\n54:36.180 --> 54:38.020\n you're launching astronauts to space,\n\n54:38.020 --> 54:43.020\n you may not want to rely absolutely on the antigen test\n\n54:43.180 --> 54:47.380\n as a thing by which you steer your decisions\n\n54:47.380 --> 54:50.420\n of like 10,000 plus people companies.\n\n54:50.420 --> 54:53.780\n But us individuals just living in the world,\n\n54:53.780 --> 54:56.140\n if you can, if it comes up positive,\n\n54:57.020 --> 54:59.340\n then you make decisions based on that.\n\n54:59.340 --> 55:01.980\n And then that scales really nicely to an entire society\n\n55:01.980 --> 55:03.620\n of hundreds of millions of people.\n\n55:03.620 --> 55:07.420\n And that's how you get that virus to stop spreading.\n\n55:07.420 --> 55:08.300\n That's exactly right.\n\n55:08.300 --> 55:10.420\n You don't have to catch every single one.\n\n55:10.420 --> 55:12.700\n And the nice thing is that these will,\n\n55:12.700 --> 55:15.740\n these will catch the people who are most infectious.\n\n55:15.740 --> 55:19.140\n So with Elon Musk, it generally that test,\n\n55:19.140 --> 55:20.460\n we don't have the counterfactual.\n\n55:20.460 --> 55:23.260\n We don't have his results from three days earlier\n\n55:23.260 --> 55:25.220\n when he was probably most infectious.\n\n55:26.180 --> 55:30.020\n But my guess is the fact that it was catching two\n\n55:30.020 --> 55:33.220\n out of the four, even when he was down at a CT value\n\n55:33.220 --> 55:36.740\n of really, really very, very low viral load on the PCR test\n\n55:36.740 --> 55:38.660\n suggests that it was doing its job.\n\n55:39.900 --> 55:42.220\n And you just wanna, and the nice thing is\n\n55:42.220 --> 55:45.820\n because these can be produced at such scale,\n\n55:45.820 --> 55:49.140\n getting one positive doesn't immediately have to mean\n\n55:49.140 --> 55:51.740\n 10 days of isolation.\n\n55:51.740 --> 55:55.620\n That's the CDC is more conservative stance to say,\n\n55:55.620 --> 55:57.580\n if you're positive on any tests,\n\n55:57.580 --> 55:59.180\n stay home for 10 days and isolate.\n\n55:59.180 --> 56:01.740\n But here, people would just have more tests.\n\n56:01.740 --> 56:04.540\n So the recommendation should be test daily.\n\n56:04.540 --> 56:06.900\n If you turn positive, test daily\n\n56:06.900 --> 56:09.220\n until you've been negative for 24, 48 hours\n\n56:09.220 --> 56:10.180\n and then go back to work.\n\n56:10.180 --> 56:12.820\n And the nice thing there is right now,\n\n56:12.820 --> 56:13.980\n people just aren't testing\n\n56:13.980 --> 56:15.700\n because they don't wanna take 10 days off.\n\n56:15.700 --> 56:16.940\n They're not getting paid for it.\n\n56:16.940 --> 56:18.540\n So they can't take 10 days off.\n\n56:18.540 --> 56:21.820\n Do you know what Elon thinks about this idea\n\n56:21.820 --> 56:23.340\n of rapid testing for everybody?\n\n56:23.340 --> 56:26.660\n So I understood I need to look at that whole Twitter thread.\n\n56:26.660 --> 56:29.740\n So I understand his perhaps criticism of,\n\n56:30.860 --> 56:34.660\n he had like a conspiratorial tone from my vague look at it\n\n56:34.660 --> 56:37.900\n of like, what's going on here with these tests?\n\n56:37.900 --> 56:40.340\n But what does he actually think about\n\n56:40.340 --> 56:42.980\n this very practical to me engineering solution\n\n56:42.980 --> 56:45.100\n of just deploying rapid tests to everybody?\n\n56:45.100 --> 56:48.540\n It seems like that's a way to open up the economy in April.\n\n56:48.540 --> 56:49.380\n Well, to be honest,\n\n56:49.380 --> 56:51.460\n I've been trying to get in touch with him again.\n\n56:51.460 --> 56:54.900\n I think, take somebody like Elon Musk\n\n56:54.900 --> 56:57.740\n with the engineering prowess within his ranks,\n\n56:57.740 --> 57:02.740\n to easily, easily build these at the tens of millions a day.\n\n57:04.380 --> 57:07.100\n He could build the machines from scratch.\n\n57:07.100 --> 57:08.180\n A lot of the companies,\n\n57:08.180 --> 57:12.820\n they buy the machines from South Korea or Taiwan, I believe.\n\n57:12.820 --> 57:15.060\n We don't have to, we can build these machines.\n\n57:15.060 --> 57:16.980\n They're simple to build.\n\n57:16.980 --> 57:20.180\n Put somebody like Elon Musk on it,\n\n57:20.180 --> 57:21.980\n take some of his best engineers and say,\n\n57:21.980 --> 57:26.900\n look, the US needs a solution in two weeks.\n\n57:26.900 --> 57:29.060\n Build these machines, figure it out.\n\n57:29.060 --> 57:30.100\n He'll do it, he could do it.\n\n57:30.100 --> 57:33.060\n This is a guy who is literally,\n\n57:33.060 --> 57:37.820\n he has started multiple entirely new industries.\n\n57:37.820 --> 57:40.820\n He has the capital to do it without the US government\n\n57:40.820 --> 57:41.860\n if he wanted to.\n\n57:41.860 --> 57:43.500\n And you know what, it would,\n\n57:43.500 --> 57:47.500\n the return on investment for him would be huge.\n\n57:47.500 --> 57:50.420\n But frankly, the return on investment in the country\n\n57:50.420 --> 57:53.500\n would be hundreds of billions of dollars,\n\n57:53.500 --> 57:55.620\n because it means we could get society open.\n\n57:55.620 --> 57:58.740\n So I know that his first experience\n\n57:58.740 --> 58:01.620\n with these rapid tests was confusing,\n\n58:01.620 --> 58:04.300\n which is how I ended up having this Twitter\n\n58:04.300 --> 58:06.980\n kind of conversation with him very briefly.\n\n58:06.980 --> 58:09.380\n But I think that if he understood\n\n58:09.380 --> 58:11.060\n sort of a little bit more, and I think he does,\n\n58:11.060 --> 58:13.340\n I really love to talk to him about it,\n\n58:13.340 --> 58:14.980\n because I think he could totally change\n\n58:14.980 --> 58:17.340\n the course of this pandemic in the United States,\n\n58:17.340 --> 58:18.420\n single handedly.\n\n58:18.420 --> 58:19.980\n He loves grand things.\n\n58:19.980 --> 58:24.700\n Yeah, I think out of all the solutions I've seen,\n\n58:24.700 --> 58:29.700\n this is the obvious engineering solution\n\n58:29.700 --> 58:32.860\n to at least a pandemic of this scale.\n\n58:32.860 --> 58:35.340\n I love that you say the engineering solution.\n\n58:35.340 --> 58:38.100\n So this is something I've been really trying to,\n\n58:38.100 --> 58:42.700\n I'm an engineer, my previous history was all engineering,\n\n58:42.700 --> 58:44.620\n and that's really how I think.\n\n58:44.620 --> 58:46.700\n I then went into medicine and PhD world,\n\n58:46.700 --> 58:51.700\n but I think that the world,\n\n58:52.180 --> 58:53.940\n like one of the major catastrophes,\n\n58:53.940 --> 58:55.340\n or one of the major problems,\n\n58:55.340 --> 58:57.980\n is that we have physicians making the decisions\n\n58:57.980 --> 59:01.300\n about public health and a pandemic,\n\n59:01.300 --> 59:03.300\n when really we need engineers.\n\n59:03.300 --> 59:05.220\n This is an engineering problem.\n\n59:05.220 --> 59:06.580\n And so what I've been trying to do,\n\n59:06.580 --> 59:10.500\n I actually really want to start a whole new field\n\n59:10.500 --> 59:12.860\n called public health engineering.\n\n59:12.860 --> 59:15.220\n And so I've been, eventually I want to try\n\n59:15.220 --> 59:16.940\n to bring it to MIT and get MIT\n\n59:16.940 --> 59:19.260\n to want to start a new department or something.\n\n59:19.260 --> 59:21.540\n That's a doubly awesome idea.\n\n59:21.540 --> 59:22.380\n Yeah.\n\n59:22.380 --> 59:24.940\n That, this is really, okay.\n\n59:24.940 --> 59:26.660\n I love this, I love every aspect.\n\n59:26.660 --> 59:29.820\n I love everything you're talking about.\n\n59:29.820 --> 59:30.900\n A lot of people believe,\n\n59:30.900 --> 59:34.460\n because vaccines started being deployed currently,\n\n59:34.460 --> 59:38.140\n that we are no longer in need of a solution.\n\n59:39.460 --> 59:44.460\n We're no longer in need of slowing the spread of the virus.\n\n59:45.340 --> 59:46.500\n To me, as I understand,\n\n59:46.500 --> 59:49.700\n it seems like this is the most important time\n\n59:49.700 --> 59:52.500\n to have something like a rapid testing solution.\n\n59:52.500 --> 59:54.620\n Can you kind of break that apart?\n\n59:54.620 --> 59:57.060\n What's the role of rapid testing currently\n\n59:57.060 --> 1:00:01.580\n in the next, what is it, three, four months maybe?\n\n1:00:01.580 --> 1:00:02.940\n Even more.\n\n1:00:02.940 --> 1:00:05.620\n The vaccine rollout isn't gonna be as peachy\n\n1:00:05.620 --> 1:00:07.940\n as everyone is hoping.\n\n1:00:07.940 --> 1:00:09.420\n And I hate to be the Debbie Downer here,\n\n1:00:09.420 --> 1:00:13.540\n but there's a lot of unknowns with this vaccine.\n\n1:00:13.540 --> 1:00:14.620\n You've already mentioned one,\n\n1:00:14.620 --> 1:00:16.100\n which is there's a lot of people\n\n1:00:16.100 --> 1:00:18.060\n who just don't want to get the vaccine.\n\n1:00:19.220 --> 1:00:21.420\n I hope that that might change as things move forward\n\n1:00:21.420 --> 1:00:23.060\n and people see their neighbors getting it\n\n1:00:23.060 --> 1:00:25.580\n and their family getting it and it's safe and all.\n\n1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:27.580\n We don't know how effective the vaccine is gonna be\n\n1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:28.620\n after two or three months.\n\n1:00:28.620 --> 1:00:30.900\n We've only measured it in the first two or three months,\n\n1:00:30.900 --> 1:00:33.180\n which is a massive problem,\n\n1:00:33.180 --> 1:00:35.100\n which we can go into biologically,\n\n1:00:35.100 --> 1:00:38.180\n because there's very good reasons to believe\n\n1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:40.100\n that the efficacy could fall way down\n\n1:00:40.100 --> 1:00:41.500\n after two or three months.\n\n1:00:42.420 --> 1:00:44.540\n We don't know if it's gonna stop transmission.\n\n1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:46.940\n And if it doesn't stop transmission,\n\n1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:48.340\n then there's, you know,\n\n1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:50.820\n herd immunity is much, much more difficult to get\n\n1:00:50.820 --> 1:00:53.540\n because that's all based on transmission blockade.\n\n1:00:54.580 --> 1:00:57.580\n And frankly, we don't know how easily\n\n1:00:57.580 --> 1:00:58.860\n we're going to be able to roll it out.\n\n1:00:58.860 --> 1:01:01.580\n Some of the vaccines need really significant cold chains,\n\n1:01:01.580 --> 1:01:04.580\n have very short half lives outside of that cold chain.\n\n1:01:05.700 --> 1:01:10.300\n We need to organize massive numbers of people\n\n1:01:10.300 --> 1:01:11.420\n to be able to distribute these.\n\n1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:14.740\n Most hospitals today are saying that they're not equipped\n\n1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:16.060\n to hire the right people\n\n1:01:16.060 --> 1:01:19.140\n to be even administering enough of these vaccines.\n\n1:01:19.140 --> 1:01:20.220\n And then a lot of the hospitals\n\n1:01:20.220 --> 1:01:22.140\n are frustrated because they're getting much lower,\n\n1:01:22.140 --> 1:01:24.860\n smaller allocations than they were expecting.\n\n1:01:24.860 --> 1:01:28.860\n So I think right now, like you say,\n\n1:01:28.860 --> 1:01:30.500\n right now is the best time,\n\n1:01:31.540 --> 1:01:34.460\n you know, besides three or four or five or six months ago,\n\n1:01:34.460 --> 1:01:38.020\n right now is the best time to get these rapid tests out.\n\n1:01:38.020 --> 1:01:39.860\n And we need to, I mean,\n\n1:01:39.860 --> 1:01:42.380\n the country has the capacity to build them.\n\n1:01:42.380 --> 1:01:45.340\n We have, we're shipping them overseas right now.\n\n1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:47.020\n We just need to flip a switch,\n\n1:01:47.020 --> 1:01:48.460\n get the FDA to recognize\n\n1:01:48.460 --> 1:01:51.460\n that there's more important things than diagnostic medicine,\n\n1:01:51.460 --> 1:01:54.860\n which is the effectiveness of the public health program\n\n1:01:54.860 --> 1:01:57.300\n when we're dealing with a pandemic.\n\n1:01:57.300 --> 1:02:00.540\n They need to authorize these as public health tools,\n\n1:02:00.540 --> 1:02:04.180\n or, you know, frankly, the president could,\n\n1:02:05.700 --> 1:02:08.540\n you know, there's a lot of other ways to get these tests\n\n1:02:08.540 --> 1:02:09.660\n to not have to go through\n\n1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:11.740\n the normal FDA authorization program,\n\n1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:15.940\n but maybe have the NIH and the CDC give a stamp of approval.\n\n1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:19.100\n And if we could, we could get these out tomorrow.\n\n1:02:19.100 --> 1:02:20.700\n And that's where that article came from,\n\n1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:23.500\n you know, how we can stop the spread of this virus\n\n1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:26.900\n by Christmas, we could, you know, now it's getting late.\n\n1:02:26.900 --> 1:02:30.180\n And so we have to keep updating that timeframe,\n\n1:02:30.180 --> 1:02:32.060\n maybe putting Christmas in the title wasn't,\n\n1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:33.580\n I should have said how we can stop\n\n1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:35.540\n the spread of this virus in a month.\n\n1:02:35.540 --> 1:02:37.220\n It would be a little bit more timeless,\n\n1:02:37.220 --> 1:02:40.620\n but we could do it, you know, we really could do it.\n\n1:02:40.620 --> 1:02:43.700\n And that's the most frustrating part here is that\n\n1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:46.460\n we're just choosing not to as a country.\n\n1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:48.820\n We're choosing to bankrupt our society\n\n1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:52.980\n because some people at the FDA and other places\n\n1:02:52.980 --> 1:02:54.980\n just can't seem to get their head around the fact\n\n1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:56.460\n that this is a public health problem,\n\n1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:58.140\n not a bunch of medical problems.\n\n1:02:58.140 --> 1:03:00.500\n Is there a way to change that policy wise?\n\n1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:03.260\n So this is a much bigger thing that you're speaking to,\n\n1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:08.260\n which I love in terms of the MIT engineering approach\n\n1:03:09.780 --> 1:03:11.500\n to public health.\n\n1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:13.260\n Is there a way to push this?\n\n1:03:13.260 --> 1:03:14.980\n Is this a political thing?\n\n1:03:14.980 --> 1:03:17.580\n Like where some Andrew Yang type characters\n\n1:03:17.580 --> 1:03:20.420\n need to like start screaming about it?\n\n1:03:20.420 --> 1:03:24.380\n Is it more of an Elon Musk thing\n\n1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:26.100\n where people just need to build it\n\n1:03:26.100 --> 1:03:28.780\n and then on Twitter start talking crap\n\n1:03:28.780 --> 1:03:31.320\n to politicians for not doing it?\n\n1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:34.820\n What are the ideas here?\n\n1:03:34.820 --> 1:03:37.140\n I think it's a little of both.\n\n1:03:37.140 --> 1:03:38.860\n I think it's political on the one hand,\n\n1:03:38.860 --> 1:03:41.100\n and I've certainly been talking to Congress a lot,\n\n1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:42.420\n talking to senators.\n\n1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:43.380\n Are they receptive?\n\n1:03:43.380 --> 1:03:44.220\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:03:44.220 --> 1:03:45.360\n I mean, that's the crazy thing.\n\n1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:47.900\n Everyone but the FDA is receptive.\n\n1:03:47.900 --> 1:03:49.240\n I mean, it's astounding.\n\n1:03:49.240 --> 1:03:53.380\n I mean, I advise, informally I advise the president\n\n1:03:53.380 --> 1:03:55.740\n and the president elects teams.\n\n1:03:55.740 --> 1:03:59.820\n I talk to Congress, I talk to senators, governors,\n\n1:04:01.140 --> 1:04:05.020\n and then all the way down to mayors of towns and things.\n\n1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:08.900\n And I mean, months ago I held a round table discussion\n\n1:04:08.900 --> 1:04:12.100\n with Mayor Garcetti, who's the mayor of LA,\n\n1:04:12.100 --> 1:04:15.340\n and I brought all the companies who make these things.\n\n1:04:15.340 --> 1:04:17.140\n This was in like July or August or something.\n\n1:04:17.140 --> 1:04:18.540\n I brought all the companies to the table\n\n1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:21.180\n and said, okay, how can we get these out?\n\n1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:23.500\n And unfortunately, it went nowhere\n\n1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:25.860\n because the FDA won't authorize them\n\n1:04:25.860 --> 1:04:27.140\n as public health tools.\n\n1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:31.100\n The nice thing is that this is one of the nice\n\n1:04:31.100 --> 1:04:32.040\n and frustrating things.\n\n1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:35.180\n This is one of the few bipartisan things that I know of.\n\n1:04:35.180 --> 1:04:38.340\n And like you said, it's a real solution.\n\n1:04:38.340 --> 1:04:40.220\n Lockdowns aren't a solution.\n\n1:04:40.220 --> 1:04:45.220\n They're an emergency bandaid to a catastrophe\n\n1:04:45.820 --> 1:04:46.960\n that's currently happening.\n\n1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:48.140\n They're not a solution.\n\n1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:51.060\n And they're definitely not a public health solution\n\n1:04:51.060 --> 1:04:53.240\n if we're taking a more holistic view of public health,\n\n1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:55.700\n which includes people's wellbeing,\n\n1:04:55.700 --> 1:04:57.460\n includes their psychological wellbeing,\n\n1:04:57.460 --> 1:04:59.620\n their financial wellbeing.\n\n1:04:59.620 --> 1:05:01.400\n Just stopping a virus if it means\n\n1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:03.840\n that all those other things get thrown under the bus\n\n1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:05.680\n is not a public health solution.\n\n1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:10.680\n It's a myopic or very tunnel visioned approach\n\n1:05:11.380 --> 1:05:14.460\n to a virus that's spreading.\n\n1:05:14.460 --> 1:05:19.460\n This is a simple solution with essentially no downfall.\n\n1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:22.060\n There is nothing bad about this.\n\n1:05:22.060 --> 1:05:25.500\n It's just giving people a result.\n\n1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:27.580\n And it's bipartisan.\n\n1:05:27.580 --> 1:05:30.540\n The most conservative and the most liberal people,\n\n1:05:30.540 --> 1:05:32.500\n everyone just wants to know their status.\n\n1:05:32.500 --> 1:05:35.700\n Nobody wants to have to wait in line for four hours\n\n1:05:35.700 --> 1:05:38.440\n to find out their status on Monday,\n\n1:05:39.380 --> 1:05:40.860\n a week later, on Saturday.\n\n1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:41.980\n It just doesn't make any sense.\n\n1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:43.700\n It's a useless test at that point.\n\n1:05:43.700 --> 1:05:45.460\n And everyone recognizes that.\n\n1:05:45.460 --> 1:05:49.380\n So why do you think, like the mayor of LA,\n\n1:05:49.380 --> 1:05:52.340\n why do you think politicians are going for these,\n\n1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:58.060\n from my perspective, like kind of half ass lockdowns,\n\n1:05:58.060 --> 1:06:01.440\n which is not, so I have seen good evidence\n\n1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:04.700\n that like a complete lockdown can work,\n\n1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:07.740\n but that's in theory, it's just like communism in theory\n\n1:06:07.740 --> 1:06:08.580\n can work.\n\n1:06:09.540 --> 1:06:12.100\n Like theoretically speaking, but it just doesn't,\n\n1:06:12.100 --> 1:06:14.740\n at least in this country, we don't,\n\n1:06:14.740 --> 1:06:17.180\n I think it's just impossible to have complete lockdown.\n\n1:06:17.180 --> 1:06:21.900\n And still politicians are going for these kind of lockdowns\n\n1:06:21.900 --> 1:06:24.020\n that everybody hates,\n\n1:06:24.020 --> 1:06:27.300\n that's really hurting small businesses.\n\n1:06:28.420 --> 1:06:29.260\n Like why are they going for that?\n\n1:06:29.260 --> 1:06:32.700\n And big businesses, and yeah, all businesses,\n\n1:06:32.700 --> 1:06:35.660\n but like basically not just hurting,\n\n1:06:35.660 --> 1:06:38.660\n they're destroying small businesses, right?\n\n1:06:38.660 --> 1:06:43.380\n Which is going to have potentially, I mean,\n\n1:06:43.380 --> 1:06:47.300\n yeah, I've been reading as I don't shut up\n\n1:06:47.300 --> 1:06:49.780\n about the rise and fall of the Third Reich,\n\n1:06:49.780 --> 1:06:54.780\n and there's economic effects that take a decade to,\n\n1:06:57.420 --> 1:06:58.940\n there's going to be long lasting effects\n\n1:06:58.940 --> 1:07:02.460\n that may be destructive to the very fabric of this nation.\n\n1:07:02.460 --> 1:07:04.500\n So why are they doing it,\n\n1:07:04.500 --> 1:07:06.260\n and why are they not using the solution?\n\n1:07:06.260 --> 1:07:07.700\n Is there any intuition?\n\n1:07:07.700 --> 1:07:11.680\n I mean, you've said that FDA has a stranglehold, I guess,\n\n1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:14.820\n on this whole public health problem.\n\n1:07:14.820 --> 1:07:16.260\n Is that all it is?\n\n1:07:16.260 --> 1:07:20.100\n That's honestly, it's pretty much all it is.\n\n1:07:20.100 --> 1:07:23.700\n The companies, so somebody like Mayor Garcetti\n\n1:07:23.700 --> 1:07:27.780\n or Governor Baker, Cuomo, Newsom,\n\n1:07:27.780 --> 1:07:31.860\n any of these, DeWine, I've talked to a lot of governors\n\n1:07:31.860 --> 1:07:33.360\n in this country at this point,\n\n1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:36.740\n and of course the federal government,\n\n1:07:36.740 --> 1:07:40.300\n including the president's own teams,\n\n1:07:40.300 --> 1:07:44.840\n and the heads of the NIH, the heads of the CDC about this.\n\n1:07:45.820 --> 1:07:50.040\n The problem is the tests don't exist in this country\n\n1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:52.420\n at the level that we need them to right now\n\n1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:57.140\n to make that kind of policy, to make that kind of program.\n\n1:07:57.140 --> 1:07:59.140\n They could, but they don't.\n\n1:07:59.140 --> 1:08:03.040\n And so what that means is that when Mayor Garcetti says,\n\n1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:05.620\n okay, what are my actual options today,\n\n1:08:06.780 --> 1:08:08.620\n despite these sounding like a great idea,\n\n1:08:08.620 --> 1:08:11.700\n he looks around and he says, well, they're not authorized.\n\n1:08:11.700 --> 1:08:15.300\n They don't exist right now for at home use.\n\n1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:16.420\n And from his perspective,\n\n1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:19.040\n he's not about to pick that fight with the FDA,\n\n1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:20.980\n and it turns out nobody is.\n\n1:08:20.980 --> 1:08:22.580\n Why are people afraid of,\n\n1:08:22.580 --> 1:08:25.140\n it seems like an easy struggle to fight.\n\n1:08:25.140 --> 1:08:25.980\n It's like a...\n\n1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:28.260\n So they don't see it as a fight.\n\n1:08:28.260 --> 1:08:31.660\n They think that the FDA is the end all be all.\n\n1:08:31.660 --> 1:08:34.680\n Everyone thinks the FDA is the end all be all.\n\n1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:37.760\n And so they just defer, everyone is deferential,\n\n1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:40.820\n including the heads of all the other government agencies\n\n1:08:40.820 --> 1:08:42.380\n because that is their role.\n\n1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:44.980\n But what everyone is failing to see\n\n1:08:44.980 --> 1:08:48.640\n is that the FDA doesn't even have a mandate or a remit\n\n1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:50.820\n to evaluate these tests as public health tools.\n\n1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:53.860\n So they're just falling in this weird gray zone\n\n1:08:53.860 --> 1:08:56.300\n where the FDA is saying, look,\n\n1:08:56.300 --> 1:08:57.980\n we evaluate medical products.\n\n1:08:57.980 --> 1:08:59.500\n That's the only thing that I meant,\n\n1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:02.740\n like Tim Stenzel, head of in vitro diagnostics at the FDA,\n\n1:09:02.740 --> 1:09:04.900\n he's doing what his job is,\n\n1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:08.240\n which is to evaluate medical tools.\n\n1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:12.340\n Unfortunately, this is where I think the CDC\n\n1:09:12.340 --> 1:09:13.820\n has really blundered.\n\n1:09:13.820 --> 1:09:17.060\n They haven't made the right distinction to say, look,\n\n1:09:17.060 --> 1:09:20.380\n okay, the FDA is evaluating these for doctors to use\n\n1:09:20.380 --> 1:09:23.260\n and all that, but we're the CDC\n\n1:09:23.260 --> 1:09:25.380\n and we're the public health agency of this country\n\n1:09:25.380 --> 1:09:27.940\n and we recognize that these tools\n\n1:09:27.940 --> 1:09:30.080\n require a different authorization pathway\n\n1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:30.920\n and a different use, not prescription.\n\n1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:33.700\n There's a difference between medical devices\n\n1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:35.340\n and public health.\n\n1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:38.500\n And I guess FDA is not designed for this public health,\n\n1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:40.660\n especially in emergency situations.\n\n1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:43.780\n And they actually explicitly say that.\n\n1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:46.340\n I mean, when I go and talk to Tim,\n\n1:09:46.340 --> 1:09:48.540\n and he's a very reasonable guy,\n\n1:09:48.540 --> 1:09:50.660\n but when I talk to him, he says,\n\n1:09:50.660 --> 1:09:55.220\n look, we don't, we just do not evaluate\n\n1:09:55.220 --> 1:09:56.060\n a public health tool.\n\n1:09:56.060 --> 1:09:57.500\n If you're telling me this is a public health tool,\n\n1:09:57.500 --> 1:09:59.240\n great, go and use it.\n\n1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:03.760\n And so I say, okay, great, we'll go and use it.\n\n1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:05.420\n And then the comment is,\n\n1:10:05.420 --> 1:10:08.780\n but does it give a result back to somebody?\n\n1:10:08.780 --> 1:10:11.060\n I say, well, yes, of course it gives a result\n\n1:10:11.060 --> 1:10:13.300\n back to somebody, it's being done in their home.\n\n1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:16.400\n So then it's defined as a medical tool, can't use it.\n\n1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:19.620\n So it's stuck in this gray zone where unfortunately,\n\n1:10:19.620 --> 1:10:21.780\n there's this weird definition that any tool,\n\n1:10:21.780 --> 1:10:25.260\n any test that gives a result back to an individual\n\n1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:29.660\n is defined by CMS, Centers for Medicaid Services,\n\n1:10:29.660 --> 1:10:34.660\n as a medical device requiring medical authorization.\n\n1:10:34.900 --> 1:10:36.900\n But then you go and ask, it gets crazier,\n\n1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:38.900\n because then you go and ask Seema Verma,\n\n1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:43.020\n the head of CMS, you know, okay,\n\n1:10:43.020 --> 1:10:47.340\n can these be authorized as public health tools\n\n1:10:47.340 --> 1:10:50.100\n and not fall under your definition of a medical device?\n\n1:10:50.100 --> 1:10:52.200\n So then the FDA doesn't have to be the ones\n\n1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:54.700\n authorizing it as a public health tool.\n\n1:10:54.700 --> 1:10:59.060\n And Seema Verma says, oh, we don't have any jurisdiction\n\n1:10:59.060 --> 1:11:04.060\n over point of care and sort of rapid devices like this.\n\n1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:07.420\n We only have jurisdiction over lab devices.\n\n1:11:07.420 --> 1:11:10.340\n So it's like nobody has ownership over it,\n\n1:11:10.340 --> 1:11:11.660\n which means that they just keep,\n\n1:11:11.660 --> 1:11:15.260\n they stay in this purgatory of not being approved.\n\n1:11:15.260 --> 1:11:18.480\n And so this is where I think, frankly, it needs a president.\n\n1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:21.040\n It needs a presidential order to just unlock them,\n\n1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:25.900\n to say this is more important than having a prescription.\n\n1:11:25.900 --> 1:11:28.240\n And in fact, I mean, really what's happening now,\n\n1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:31.280\n because there is this sense that tests\n\n1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:32.760\n are public health tools,\n\n1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:35.140\n even if they're not being defined as such,\n\n1:11:35.140 --> 1:11:37.100\n the FDA now is pretty much,\n\n1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:39.100\n not only are they not authorizing these\n\n1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:41.140\n as public health tools,\n\n1:11:41.140 --> 1:11:43.700\n what they're doing by authorizing\n\n1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:47.500\n what are effectively public health tools as medical devices,\n\n1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:50.620\n they're just diluting down the practice of medicine.\n\n1:11:50.620 --> 1:11:54.240\n I mean, his answer right now, unfortunately is,\n\n1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:56.940\n well, I don't know why you want these to be\n\n1:11:56.940 --> 1:11:58.940\n sort of available to everyone without a prescription.\n\n1:11:58.940 --> 1:12:01.240\n We've already said that a doctor can write\n\n1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:04.780\n a whole prescription for a whole college campus.\n\n1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:06.580\n It's like, well, if you're going in that direction then,\n\n1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:08.660\n and that's no longer medicine,\n\n1:12:08.660 --> 1:12:11.580\n having a doctor write a prescription for a college campus,\n\n1:12:11.580 --> 1:12:14.360\n for everyone on the campus to have repeat testing,\n\n1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:18.780\n now we're just in the territory of eroding medicine\n\n1:12:18.780 --> 1:12:20.860\n and eroding all of the legal rules\n\n1:12:20.860 --> 1:12:23.820\n and reasons that we have prescriptions in the first place.\n\n1:12:23.820 --> 1:12:27.140\n So it's just everything about it is just destructive\n\n1:12:27.140 --> 1:12:29.900\n instead of just making a simple solution,\n\n1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:32.980\n which is these are okay as public health tools\n\n1:12:32.980 --> 1:12:35.500\n as long as they meet X and Y metrics,\n\n1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:38.140\n go and CDC can put their stamp of approval on them.\n\n1:12:38.140 --> 1:12:41.660\n What do you think, sorry if I'm stuck on this,\n\n1:12:41.660 --> 1:12:46.660\n your mention of MIT and public health engineering, right?\n\n1:12:47.260 --> 1:12:49.100\n I mean, it has a sense of,\n\n1:12:49.100 --> 1:12:51.380\n I talked to computational biology folks.\n\n1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:54.140\n It's always exciting to see computer scientists\n\n1:12:54.140 --> 1:12:56.140\n start entering the space of biology.\n\n1:12:56.140 --> 1:12:58.100\n And there's actually a lot of exciting things\n\n1:12:58.100 --> 1:12:59.780\n that happen because of that,\n\n1:12:59.780 --> 1:13:03.060\n trying to understand the fundamentals of biology.\n\n1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:07.400\n So from the engineering approach to public health,\n\n1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:09.660\n what kind of problems do you think can be tackled?\n\n1:13:09.660 --> 1:13:11.580\n What kind of disciplines are involved?\n\n1:13:11.580 --> 1:13:14.200\n Like, do you have ideas in this space?\n\n1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:15.040\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:19.600\n I mean, I can speak to one of the major activities\n\n1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:20.440\n that I wanna do.\n\n1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.180\n So what I normally do in my research lab\n\n1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:26.260\n is develop technologies that can take a drop\n\n1:13:26.260 --> 1:13:27.940\n of somebody's blood or some saliva\n\n1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:30.560\n and profile for hundreds of thousands\n\n1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:33.300\n of different antibodies against every single pathogen\n\n1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:35.540\n that somebody could be possibly exposed to.\n\n1:13:35.540 --> 1:13:36.380\n That's awesome.\n\n1:13:36.380 --> 1:13:38.300\n So this is all new technology\n\n1:13:38.300 --> 1:13:39.440\n that we've been developing more\n\n1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:43.100\n from a bioengineering perspective.\n\n1:13:43.100 --> 1:13:47.700\n But then I use a lot of the mathematics tools\n\n1:13:47.700 --> 1:13:49.380\n to A, interpret that.\n\n1:13:49.380 --> 1:13:51.020\n But what I really wanna do, for example,\n\n1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:52.680\n to kind of kick off this new field\n\n1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:55.260\n of what I consider public health engineering\n\n1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:57.640\n is to create, maybe it's a little ambitious,\n\n1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:02.260\n but create a weather system for viruses.\n\n1:14:02.260 --> 1:14:06.100\n I want us to be able to open up our iPhones,\n\n1:14:06.100 --> 1:14:08.820\n plug in our zip code and get a better sense,\n\n1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:11.700\n get a probability of why my kid has a runny nose today.\n\n1:14:11.700 --> 1:14:13.060\n Is it COVID?\n\n1:14:13.060 --> 1:14:16.500\n Is it a rhinovirus, an adenovirus, or is it flu?\n\n1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:17.980\n And we can do that.\n\n1:14:17.980 --> 1:14:21.100\n We can start building the rules of virus spread\n\n1:14:21.100 --> 1:14:24.300\n across the globe, both for pandemic preparedness,\n\n1:14:24.300 --> 1:14:28.900\n but also for just everyday use in the same way\n\n1:14:28.900 --> 1:14:31.180\n that people used to think that predicting the weather\n\n1:14:31.180 --> 1:14:33.220\n was gonna be impossible.\n\n1:14:33.220 --> 1:14:34.860\n Of course, we know that's not impossible now.\n\n1:14:34.860 --> 1:14:35.740\n Is it always perfect?\n\n1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:39.780\n No, but does it offer, does it completely change the way\n\n1:14:39.780 --> 1:14:42.260\n that we go about our days?\n\n1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:43.140\n Absolutely.\n\n1:14:44.380 --> 1:14:46.860\n I envision, for example, right now,\n\n1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:50.100\n we open up our iPhone, we plug in a zip code,\n\n1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:51.860\n and if it tells us it's gonna rain today,\n\n1:14:51.860 --> 1:14:53.380\n we bring an umbrella.\n\n1:14:53.380 --> 1:14:56.100\n So in the future, it tells us,\n\n1:14:56.100 --> 1:14:59.660\n hey, there's a lot of SARS CoV2 in your community.\n\n1:14:59.660 --> 1:15:02.500\n Instead of grabbing your umbrella, you grab your mask.\n\n1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:05.260\n We don't have to have masks all the time.\n\n1:15:05.260 --> 1:15:07.380\n But if we know the rules of the game\n\n1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:09.340\n that these viruses play by,\n\n1:15:09.340 --> 1:15:10.820\n we can start preparing for those.\n\n1:15:10.820 --> 1:15:15.820\n And every year, we go into every flu season blindfolded\n\n1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:18.700\n with our hands tied behind our back, just saying,\n\n1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:21.660\n I hope this isn't a bad flu season this year.\n\n1:15:21.660 --> 1:15:26.340\n I don't, I mean, this is, we're in the 21st century.\n\n1:15:28.980 --> 1:15:31.140\n We have the tools at our disposal now\n\n1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:32.740\n to not have that attitude.\n\n1:15:32.740 --> 1:15:35.420\n This isn't like 1920s.\n\n1:15:35.420 --> 1:15:37.380\n You know, we can just say,\n\n1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:40.500\n hey, this is gonna be a bad flu season this year.\n\n1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:44.780\n Let's act accordingly and with a targeted approach.\n\n1:15:44.780 --> 1:15:47.060\n You know, we don't, for example,\n\n1:15:47.060 --> 1:15:50.300\n we don't just use our umbrellas all day long,\n\n1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.620\n every single day, in case it might rain.\n\n1:15:53.620 --> 1:15:55.580\n We don't board up our homes every single day\n\n1:15:55.580 --> 1:15:56.700\n in case there's a hurricane.\n\n1:15:56.700 --> 1:15:58.940\n We wait, and if we know that there's one coming,\n\n1:15:58.940 --> 1:16:03.420\n then we act for a small period of time accordingly.\n\n1:16:03.420 --> 1:16:05.780\n And then we go back, and we've prepared ourselves\n\n1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:09.220\n in like these little bursts to not have it ruin our days.\n\n1:16:09.220 --> 1:16:10.740\n I can't tell you how exciting\n\n1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:13.140\n that vision of the future is.\n\n1:16:13.140 --> 1:16:14.580\n I think that's incredible.\n\n1:16:14.580 --> 1:16:17.380\n And it seems like it should be within our reach,\n\n1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:22.380\n the, just these like weather maps of viruses\n\n1:16:22.380 --> 1:16:26.060\n floating about the Earth, and it seems obvious.\n\n1:16:26.060 --> 1:16:28.780\n It's one of those things where right now,\n\n1:16:28.780 --> 1:16:31.980\n it seems like maybe impossible.\n\n1:16:31.980 --> 1:16:34.820\n And then looking back like 20 years from now,\n\n1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:37.620\n we'll wonder like why the hell\n\n1:16:37.620 --> 1:16:39.340\n this hasn't been done way earlier.\n\n1:16:39.340 --> 1:16:42.260\n Though one difference between weather,\n\n1:16:42.260 --> 1:16:45.380\n I don't know if you have interesting ideas in this space.\n\n1:16:45.380 --> 1:16:47.940\n The difference between weather and viruses\n\n1:16:47.940 --> 1:16:51.140\n is it includes, the collection of the data\n\n1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:54.460\n includes the human body, potentially.\n\n1:16:54.460 --> 1:16:59.420\n And that means that there is some, as with the contact\n\n1:16:59.420 --> 1:17:03.460\n tracing question, there's some concern about privacy.\n\n1:17:03.460 --> 1:17:06.220\n There seems to be this dance that's really complicated.\n\n1:17:07.700 --> 1:17:11.180\n With Facebook getting a lot of flack\n\n1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:13.540\n for basically misusing people's data,\n\n1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:17.460\n or just whether it's perception or reality,\n\n1:17:17.460 --> 1:17:19.900\n there's certainly a lot of reality to it too,\n\n1:17:19.900 --> 1:17:24.900\n where they're not good stewards of our private data.\n\n1:17:25.380 --> 1:17:28.900\n So there's this weird place where it's like obvious\n\n1:17:28.900 --> 1:17:33.100\n that if we do, if we collect a lot of data\n\n1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:37.180\n about human beings and maintain privacy\n\n1:17:37.180 --> 1:17:40.900\n and maintain all like basic respect for that data,\n\n1:17:40.900 --> 1:17:43.780\n just like honestly common sense respect for the data,\n\n1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:46.340\n that we can do a lot of amazing things for the world,\n\n1:17:46.340 --> 1:17:48.940\n like a weather map for viruses.\n\n1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:52.740\n Is there a way forward to gain trust of people\n\n1:17:53.700 --> 1:17:56.740\n or to do this well, do you have ideas here?\n\n1:17:56.740 --> 1:17:58.540\n How big is this problem?\n\n1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:00.740\n I think it's a central problem.\n\n1:18:00.740 --> 1:18:02.700\n There's a couple central problems that need to be solved.\n\n1:18:02.700 --> 1:18:05.580\n One, how do you get all the samples?\n\n1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:07.060\n That's not actually too difficult.\n\n1:18:07.060 --> 1:18:10.100\n I'm actually, I have a pilot project going right now\n\n1:18:10.100 --> 1:18:13.300\n with getting samples from across all the United States.\n\n1:18:14.340 --> 1:18:16.140\n Tens of thousands of samples every week\n\n1:18:16.140 --> 1:18:19.220\n are flowing into my lab and we process them.\n\n1:18:19.220 --> 1:18:22.260\n So it's taking the, it's taking like one of the,\n\n1:18:22.260 --> 1:18:26.220\n basically there's biology here and chemistry\n\n1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:27.900\n and converting that into numbers.\n\n1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:28.740\n That's exactly right.\n\n1:18:28.740 --> 1:18:30.060\n So what we're doing, for example,\n\n1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:32.980\n there's a lot of people who go to the hospital every day,\n\n1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:36.300\n a lot of people who donate blood, people who donate plasma.\n\n1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:38.540\n So one of the projects that I have,\n\n1:18:38.540 --> 1:18:40.260\n I'll get to the privacy question in a moment,\n\n1:18:40.260 --> 1:18:43.060\n but this, so what I wanna do is the name that I've given\n\n1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:46.980\n this as a global immunological observatory.\n\n1:18:46.980 --> 1:18:48.500\n There's no reason not to have that.\n\n1:18:48.500 --> 1:18:49.460\n Good name.\n\n1:18:49.460 --> 1:18:51.140\n I've said, instead of saying, well,\n\n1:18:51.140 --> 1:18:53.540\n how do we possibly get enough people on board\n\n1:18:53.540 --> 1:18:56.020\n to send in samples all the time?\n\n1:18:56.020 --> 1:18:57.700\n Well, just go to the source.\n\n1:18:57.700 --> 1:18:59.700\n So there's a company in Massachusetts\n\n1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:02.260\n that makes 80% of all the instruments\n\n1:19:02.260 --> 1:19:07.140\n that are used globally to collect plasma from plasma donors.\n\n1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:11.380\n So I went to this company, Hemenetics, and said,\n\n1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:15.500\n is there a way you have 80% of the global market\n\n1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:17.660\n on plasma donations?\n\n1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:21.500\n Can we start getting plasma samples\n\n1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:24.220\n from healthy people that use your machines?\n\n1:19:24.220 --> 1:19:26.700\n So that hooked me up with this company called Octopharma.\n\n1:19:26.700 --> 1:19:28.700\n And Octopharma has a huge reach\n\n1:19:28.700 --> 1:19:30.860\n and offices all over the country\n\n1:19:30.860 --> 1:19:32.780\n where they're just collecting people's plasma.\n\n1:19:32.780 --> 1:19:35.460\n They actually pay people for their plasma\n\n1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:37.100\n and then that gets distributed to hospitals\n\n1:19:37.100 --> 1:19:39.340\n and all this stuff is anonymous plasma.\n\n1:19:39.340 --> 1:19:41.740\n So I've just been collecting anonymous samples.\n\n1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:45.100\n And we're processing them, in this case,\n\n1:19:45.100 --> 1:19:48.340\n for COVID antibodies to watch from January\n\n1:19:48.340 --> 1:19:51.420\n up through December, we're able to watch\n\n1:19:51.420 --> 1:19:54.220\n how the virus entered into the United States\n\n1:19:54.220 --> 1:19:58.780\n and how it's transmitting every day across the US.\n\n1:19:58.780 --> 1:20:02.460\n So we're getting those results organized now\n\n1:20:02.460 --> 1:20:06.060\n and we're gonna start putting them publicly online soon\n\n1:20:06.060 --> 1:20:09.420\n to start making at least a very rough map of COVID.\n\n1:20:10.860 --> 1:20:12.820\n But that's the type of thinking that I have\n\n1:20:12.820 --> 1:20:14.700\n in terms of like, how do you actually capture\n\n1:20:14.700 --> 1:20:17.060\n huge numbers of specimens?\n\n1:20:17.060 --> 1:20:20.220\n You can't ask everyone to participate on sort of a,\n\n1:20:20.220 --> 1:20:23.020\n I mean, you maybe could if you have the right tools\n\n1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:25.420\n and you can offer individuals something in return\n\n1:20:25.420 --> 1:20:26.820\n like 23andMe does.\n\n1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:29.980\n That's a great way to get people to give specimens\n\n1:20:29.980 --> 1:20:31.060\n and they get results back.\n\n1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:34.500\n So with these technologies that I've been building\n\n1:20:34.500 --> 1:20:36.140\n along with some collaborators at Harvard,\n\n1:20:36.140 --> 1:20:39.940\n we can come up with tools that people might actually want.\n\n1:20:39.940 --> 1:20:43.260\n So I can offer you your immunological history.\n\n1:20:43.260 --> 1:20:47.100\n I can say, give me a drop of your blood on a filter paper,\n\n1:20:47.100 --> 1:20:49.860\n mail it in and I will be able to tell you\n\n1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:52.060\n every infectious disease you've ever encountered\n\n1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:54.460\n and maybe even when you encountered it roughly.\n\n1:20:55.620 --> 1:20:58.820\n I could tell you, do you have COVID antibodies right now?\n\n1:20:58.820 --> 1:21:00.620\n Do you have Lyme disease antibodies right now?\n\n1:21:00.620 --> 1:21:03.740\n Flu, triple E and all these different viruses.\n\n1:21:03.740 --> 1:21:07.380\n Also peanut allergies, milk allergies, anything.\n\n1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:11.300\n If your immune system makes a response to it,\n\n1:21:11.300 --> 1:21:13.260\n we can detect that response.\n\n1:21:14.940 --> 1:21:17.660\n So all of a sudden we have this very valuable technology\n\n1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:19.980\n that on the one hand gives people maybe information\n\n1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:22.020\n they might want to know about themselves,\n\n1:21:22.020 --> 1:21:25.020\n but on the other hand becomes this amazingly rich\n\n1:21:25.020 --> 1:21:28.100\n source of big data to enter into\n\n1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:29.900\n this global immunological observatory\n\n1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:32.260\n sort of mathematical framework to start building\n\n1:21:32.260 --> 1:21:34.820\n these maps, these epidemiological tools.\n\n1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:36.740\n But you asked about privacy\n\n1:21:36.740 --> 1:21:40.380\n and absolutely that's essential to keep in mind\n\n1:21:40.380 --> 1:21:41.900\n first and foremost.\n\n1:21:41.900 --> 1:21:43.740\n So privacy can be,\n\n1:21:43.740 --> 1:21:47.100\n you can keep these samples 100% anonymous.\n\n1:21:47.100 --> 1:21:49.340\n They are just, when I get them, they show up with nothing.\n\n1:21:49.340 --> 1:21:51.340\n They're literally just tubes.\n\n1:21:51.340 --> 1:21:52.900\n I know a date that they were collected\n\n1:21:52.900 --> 1:21:54.660\n and a zip code that they're collected from\n\n1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:59.020\n or even just sort of a county level ID.\n\n1:21:59.020 --> 1:22:02.300\n So with an IRB and with ethical approval\n\n1:22:02.300 --> 1:22:03.740\n and with the people's consent,\n\n1:22:03.740 --> 1:22:05.100\n we can maybe collect more data,\n\n1:22:05.100 --> 1:22:07.340\n but that would require consent.\n\n1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:09.540\n But then there's this other approach\n\n1:22:09.540 --> 1:22:10.980\n which I'm really excited about,\n\n1:22:10.980 --> 1:22:14.460\n which is certainly going to gain some scrutiny I think,\n\n1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:17.900\n but we'll have to figure out where it comes into play.\n\n1:22:17.900 --> 1:22:20.660\n But I've been recognizing that we can take somebody's\n\n1:22:20.660 --> 1:22:24.060\n immunological profile and we can make a biological\n\n1:22:24.060 --> 1:22:25.700\n fingerprint out of it.\n\n1:22:25.700 --> 1:22:27.300\n And it's actually stable enough\n\n1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:28.540\n so that I could take your blood.\n\n1:22:28.540 --> 1:22:30.460\n Let's say I don't know who you are,\n\n1:22:30.460 --> 1:22:34.300\n but you sent me a drop of blood a year ago\n\n1:22:34.300 --> 1:22:36.540\n and then you sent me a drop of blood today.\n\n1:22:36.540 --> 1:22:38.300\n I don't know that those two blood spots\n\n1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:39.740\n are coming from the same person.\n\n1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:41.420\n They're just showing up in my lab.\n\n1:22:42.380 --> 1:22:46.500\n But I can run our technology over\n\n1:22:46.500 --> 1:22:49.820\n and it just gives me your immunological history.\n\n1:22:49.820 --> 1:22:52.340\n But your immunological history is so unique to you\n\n1:22:52.340 --> 1:22:55.380\n and the way that your body responds to these pathogens\n\n1:22:55.380 --> 1:22:57.180\n is so unique to you\n\n1:22:57.180 --> 1:22:59.620\n that I can use that to tether your two samples.\n\n1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:02.700\n I don't know who you are, I know nothing about you.\n\n1:23:02.700 --> 1:23:06.580\n I only know when those samples came out of a person.\n\n1:23:06.580 --> 1:23:09.100\n But I can say, oh, these two samples a year apart\n\n1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:10.900\n actually belong to the same person.\n\n1:23:10.900 --> 1:23:12.340\n Yeah, so there's sufficient information\n\n1:23:12.340 --> 1:23:16.060\n in that immunological history to match the samples.\n\n1:23:16.060 --> 1:23:18.540\n Or from a privacy perspective, that's really exciting.\n\n1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:20.220\n Does that generally hold for humans?\n\n1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:23.780\n So you're saying there's enough uniqueness to match?\n\n1:23:23.780 --> 1:23:25.980\n Yeah, because it's very stochastic, even twins.\n\n1:23:25.980 --> 1:23:28.220\n So this, I believe, we haven't published this yet.\n\n1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:29.380\n We will soon.\n\n1:23:29.380 --> 1:23:30.540\n You have a twin too, right?\n\n1:23:30.540 --> 1:23:32.500\n I do have a twin, I have an identical twin brother,\n\n1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:34.660\n which makes me interested in this.\n\n1:23:34.660 --> 1:23:36.460\n He looks very much like me.\n\n1:23:36.460 --> 1:23:37.620\n Oh, is that how that works?\n\n1:23:37.620 --> 1:23:38.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:41.940\n And DNA can't really tell us apart.\n\n1:23:42.780 --> 1:23:45.580\n But this tool is one of the only tools in the world\n\n1:23:45.580 --> 1:23:48.020\n that could tell twins apart from each other.\n\n1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:51.540\n Could still be accurate enough to say this blood,\n\n1:23:51.540 --> 1:23:56.540\n it's like 99.999% accurate to say\n\n1:23:56.940 --> 1:24:00.380\n that these two blood samples came from the same individual.\n\n1:24:00.380 --> 1:24:01.940\n And it's because it's a combination,\n\n1:24:01.940 --> 1:24:04.140\n both of your immunological history,\n\n1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:09.140\n but also how your unique body responds to a pathogen,\n\n1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:10.900\n which is random.\n\n1:24:10.900 --> 1:24:14.180\n The way that we make antibodies is, by and large,\n\n1:24:14.180 --> 1:24:17.540\n it's got an element of randomness to it.\n\n1:24:17.540 --> 1:24:19.460\n How the cells, when they make an antibody,\n\n1:24:19.460 --> 1:24:22.500\n they chop up the genetic code to say,\n\n1:24:22.500 --> 1:24:24.220\n okay, this is the antibody that I'm gonna form\n\n1:24:24.220 --> 1:24:26.180\n for this pathogen.\n\n1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:29.740\n And you might form, if you get a coronavirus, for example,\n\n1:24:29.740 --> 1:24:31.940\n you might form hundreds of different antibodies,\n\n1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:33.940\n not just one antibody against the spike protein,\n\n1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:35.700\n but hundreds of different antibodies\n\n1:24:35.700 --> 1:24:38.300\n against all different parts of the virus.\n\n1:24:38.300 --> 1:24:42.180\n So that gives this really rich resolution of information\n\n1:24:42.180 --> 1:24:43.620\n that when I then do the same thing\n\n1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:45.340\n across hundreds of different pathogens,\n\n1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:48.300\n some of which you've seen, some of which you haven't,\n\n1:24:48.300 --> 1:24:50.540\n it gives you an exceedingly unique fingerprint\n\n1:24:50.540 --> 1:24:54.900\n that is sufficiently stable over years and years and years\n\n1:24:54.900 --> 1:24:57.740\n to essentially give you a barcode.\n\n1:24:57.740 --> 1:24:59.580\n And I don't have to know who you are,\n\n1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:01.380\n but I can know that these two specimens\n\n1:25:01.380 --> 1:25:04.500\n came from the same person somewhere out in the world.\n\n1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:07.020\n So fascinating that there's this trace,\n\n1:25:07.020 --> 1:25:11.160\n your life story in the space of viruses,\n\n1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:16.160\n in the space of pathogen, like these,\n\n1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:18.680\n you know, because there's this entire universe\n\n1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:22.200\n of these organisms that are trying to destroy each other.\n\n1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:25.920\n And then your little trajectory through that space\n\n1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:29.400\n leaves a trace, and then you can look at that trace.\n\n1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:30.320\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:33.120\n And that, I mean, there's, okay,\n\n1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:35.520\n that data period is just fascinating.\n\n1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:40.200\n And the vision of making that data universally connected\n\n1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:43.580\n to where you can make, like infer things,\n\n1:25:43.580 --> 1:25:47.440\n and just like with the weather, is really fascinating.\n\n1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:49.800\n And there's probably artificial intelligence\n\n1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.880\n applications there, start making predictions,\n\n1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:53.080\n start finding patterns.\n\n1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:54.880\n Exactly, we're doing a lot of that already.\n\n1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:57.280\n And that's how, how do we have this going?\n\n1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:00.320\n You know, I've been trying to get this funded for years now.\n\n1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:02.640\n And I've spoken to governments, you know,\n\n1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:05.440\n everyone says, cool idea, not gonna do it.\n\n1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:07.200\n You know, why do we need it?\n\n1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:08.040\n Oh, really?\n\n1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:08.860\n The why do you need it?\n\n1:26:08.860 --> 1:26:10.040\n Yeah, the why do you need it.\n\n1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.200\n And of course now, you know, I mean,\n\n1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:14.380\n I wrote in 2015 about this,\n\n1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:18.160\n why we would, why this would be useful.\n\n1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:21.240\n And of course, now we're seeing why it would be useful.\n\n1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:25.560\n Had we had this up and running in 2019,\n\n1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:28.520\n had we had it going, we were drawing blood from,\n\n1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:30.760\n you know, we're getting blood samples from hospitals\n\n1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:32.800\n and clinics and blood donors from New York City,\n\n1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:36.320\n let's just say, you know, that could have,\n\n1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:40.640\n we didn't run the first PCR test for coronavirus\n\n1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:43.880\n until probably a month and a half or two months\n\n1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:46.960\n after the virus started transmitting in New York City.\n\n1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:48.040\n So it's like with the rain,\n\n1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:52.320\n we didn't start wearing umbrella or taking out umbrellas.\n\n1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:55.160\n Exactly, for two months, but different than the rain,\n\n1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:58.000\n we couldn't actually see that it was spreading right now.\n\n1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.560\n And so Andrew Cuomo had no choice\n\n1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:02.200\n but to leave the city open.\n\n1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:03.840\n You know, there were hints that maybe the virus\n\n1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:05.360\n was spreading in New York City,\n\n1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:07.900\n but you know, he didn't have any data to back it up.\n\n1:27:07.900 --> 1:27:08.740\n No data.\n\n1:27:08.740 --> 1:27:11.320\n And so it was just week on week and week.\n\n1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:17.060\n And he didn't have any information to really go by\n\n1:27:17.060 --> 1:27:18.800\n to allow him to have the firepower\n\n1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:20.480\n to say we're closing down the city.\n\n1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:21.360\n This is an emergency.\n\n1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.360\n We have to stop spread before it starts.\n\n1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:28.300\n And so they waited until the first PCR tests\n\n1:27:28.300 --> 1:27:29.140\n were coming about.\n\n1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:30.600\n And then the moment they started running PCR tests,\n\n1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:32.280\n they find out it's everywhere.\n\n1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:33.840\n You know, and so that was a disaster\n\n1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:36.440\n because of course New York City, you know,\n\n1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:39.720\n was just hit so bad because nobody was,\n\n1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:41.640\n you know, we were blind to it.\n\n1:27:41.640 --> 1:27:43.000\n We didn't have to be blind to it.\n\n1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.640\n And the nice thing about this technology is\n\n1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:47.940\n we wouldn't have, with the exact same technology\n\n1:27:47.940 --> 1:27:51.560\n we had in 2017, we could have detected\n\n1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:56.320\n this novel coronavirus spreading in New York City in 2020.\n\n1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:58.860\n Not because we changed, not because we are actually\n\n1:27:58.860 --> 1:28:01.560\n actively looking for this novel coronavirus,\n\n1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:04.300\n but because we would see, we would have seen patterns\n\n1:28:04.300 --> 1:28:06.400\n in people's immune responses using AI,\n\n1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:10.520\n or just frankly using our, just the raw data itself.\n\n1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:13.180\n We could have said, hey, it looks like there's\n\n1:28:13.180 --> 1:28:15.760\n something that looks like known coronavirus\n\n1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:18.280\n is spreading in New York, but there's gaps.\n\n1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:19.800\n You know, there's, for some reason,\n\n1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:21.680\n people aren't developing an immune response\n\n1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:23.500\n to this coronavirus that seems to be spreading\n\n1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:25.640\n to these normal things that, you know,\n\n1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:28.280\n and it just looks, the profile looks different.\n\n1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:31.600\n And we could have seen that and immediately,\n\n1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:33.680\n especially since we had an idea that\n\n1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.560\n there was a novel coronavirus circulating in the world,\n\n1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:39.960\n we could have very quickly and easily seen,\n\n1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:42.760\n hey, clearly we're seeing a spike of something\n\n1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.320\n that looks like a known coronavirus,\n\n1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:46.960\n but people are responding weirdly to it.\n\n1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:49.640\n Our AI algorithms would have picked it up,\n\n1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:52.760\n and just our basic, heck, you could have put it\n\n1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:55.040\n in an Excel spreadsheet, we would have seen it.\n\n1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:56.600\n So.\n\n1:28:56.600 --> 1:28:58.240\n Some basic visualization would have shown it.\n\n1:28:58.240 --> 1:28:59.840\n Exactly, we would have seen spikes,\n\n1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.680\n and they would have been kind of like off, you know,\n\n1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:04.440\n immune responses that the shape of them\n\n1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.320\n just looked a little bit different,\n\n1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:07.600\n but they would have been growing,\n\n1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:09.400\n and we would have seen it, and it could have\n\n1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:12.320\n saved tens of thousands of lives in New York City.\n\n1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:14.040\n So to me, the fascinating question,\n\n1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:15.040\n everything we've talked about,\n\n1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:18.040\n so both the huge collection of data at scale,\n\n1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:22.600\n just super exciting, and then the kind of obvious\n\n1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:26.320\n at scale solution to the current virus\n\n1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:30.200\n and future ones is the rapid testing.\n\n1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:34.440\n Can we talk about the future of viruses\n\n1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:39.440\n that might be threatening our very existence?\n\n1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:44.160\n So do you think like a future natural virus\n\n1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:49.160\n can have an order of magnitude greater effect\n\n1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:52.240\n on human civilization than anything we've ever seen?\n\n1:29:52.240 --> 1:29:56.200\n So something that either kills all humans,\n\n1:29:56.200 --> 1:30:01.200\n or kills, I don't know, 60, 70% of humans.\n\n1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:06.520\n So something like something we can't even imagine.\n\n1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:09.360\n Is that something that you think is possible?\n\n1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:11.760\n Because it seems to not have happened yet.\n\n1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:16.760\n So maybe like the entirety, whoever the programmer is\n\n1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:20.040\n of the simulation that sort of launched the evolution\n\n1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:24.680\n from the Big Bang seems to not want to destroy us humans.\n\n1:30:24.680 --> 1:30:26.320\n Or maybe that's the natural side effect\n\n1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:30.280\n of the evolutionary process that humans are useful.\n\n1:30:30.280 --> 1:30:31.520\n But do you think it's possible\n\n1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:34.160\n that the evolutionary process will produce a virus\n\n1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:35.720\n that will kill all humans?\n\n1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:36.960\n I think it could.\n\n1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:38.080\n I don't think it's likely.\n\n1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:39.640\n And the reason I don't think it's likely\n\n1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:43.480\n is on the one hand, it hasn't happened yet,\n\n1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:50.080\n in part because mobility is a recent phenomena.\n\n1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:52.560\n People weren't particularly mobile\n\n1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:55.960\n until fairly recently.\n\n1:30:55.960 --> 1:30:58.520\n Now, of course, now that we have people flying back\n\n1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:00.600\n and forth across the globe all the time,\n\n1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:05.240\n the chances of global pandemics\n\n1:31:05.240 --> 1:31:08.120\n has escalated exponentially, of course.\n\n1:31:08.120 --> 1:31:10.000\n And so on the one hand,\n\n1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:11.920\n that's part of why it hasn't happened yet.\n\n1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:14.240\n We can look at things like Ebola.\n\n1:31:14.240 --> 1:31:19.240\n Now, Ebola, we haven't generally had major Ebola epidemics\n\n1:31:19.240 --> 1:31:21.880\n in the past, not because Ebola wasn't transmitting\n\n1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:25.880\n and infecting humans, but because it was largely affecting\n\n1:31:25.880 --> 1:31:29.600\n and infecting humans in disconnected communities.\n\n1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:34.600\n So you see out in rural parts of Africa, for example,\n\n1:31:34.600 --> 1:31:36.880\n in Western Africa, you might end up having\n\n1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:39.360\n isolated Ebola outbreaks,\n\n1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:42.480\n but there weren't connections that were fast enough\n\n1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:45.240\n that would allow people to then spread it into the cities.\n\n1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:50.240\n Of course, we saw back in 2014, 15 massive Ebola outbreak\n\n1:31:53.280 --> 1:31:58.280\n that wasn't because it was a new strain of Ebola,\n\n1:31:58.280 --> 1:32:01.400\n but it was because there's new inroads and connections\n\n1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:04.800\n between the communities and people got it to the city.\n\n1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:07.160\n And so we saw it start to spread.\n\n1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:11.000\n So that should be a little bit foreshadowing\n\n1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:12.720\n of what's to come.\n\n1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:15.360\n And now we have this pandemic.\n\n1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:17.240\n We had 2009, we have this.\n\n1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:23.640\n There is a benefit or there is sort of a natural check.\n\n1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:26.360\n And this is like kind of like a Voltaire\n\n1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:28.680\n predator prey dynamic kind of systems,\n\n1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:30.920\n ecological systems and mathematics that\n\n1:32:32.160 --> 1:32:34.560\n if you have something that's so deadly,\n\n1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:39.560\n people will respond more maybe with a greater panic,\n\n1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:42.200\n a greater sense of panic, which alone could, you know,\n\n1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:43.600\n destroy humanity.\n\n1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:47.760\n But at the same time, we now know that we can lock down.\n\n1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:49.120\n We know that that's possible.\n\n1:32:49.120 --> 1:32:50.760\n And so if this was a worse virus\n\n1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:53.800\n that was actually killing 60% of people as infecting,\n\n1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:55.920\n we would lock down very quickly.\n\n1:32:55.920 --> 1:32:59.520\n My biggest fear though, is let's say that was happening.\n\n1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:03.000\n You need serious lockdowns if you're gonna keep things going.\n\n1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:05.280\n So the only reason we were able to keep things going\n\n1:33:05.280 --> 1:33:08.480\n during our lockdowns is because it wasn't so bad\n\n1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:10.120\n that we were still able to have people work\n\n1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:13.360\n in the grocery stores.\n\n1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:14.640\n Still have people work in the shipping\n\n1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:16.640\n to get the food onto the shelves.\n\n1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:18.800\n So on the one hand, we could probably figure out\n\n1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:20.120\n how to stop the virus,\n\n1:33:21.200 --> 1:33:24.880\n but can we stop the virus without starving?\n\n1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:26.520\n You know, and I'm not sure that that,\n\n1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:30.240\n if this was another acute respiratory virus\n\n1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:34.080\n that say had a slightly, say it transmitted the same way,\n\n1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:36.360\n but say it actually did worse damage to your heart,\n\n1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:38.040\n but it was like a month later\n\n1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:41.480\n that people started having heart attacks in mass.\n\n1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:45.640\n You know, it's like not just one offs, but really severe.\n\n1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:49.080\n Well, that could be a serious problem for humanity.\n\n1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:53.680\n So in some ways I think that there are lots of ways\n\n1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:56.800\n that we could end up dying at the hand of a virus.\n\n1:33:56.800 --> 1:33:57.800\n I mean, we're already seeing it.\n\n1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:00.040\n Just, I mean, my fear is still,\n\n1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:02.400\n I think coronaviruses have demonstrated\n\n1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:06.520\n a keen ability to destroy or to create outbreaks\n\n1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:10.320\n that can potentially be deadly to large numbers of people.\n\n1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:14.560\n Flu strains, though, are still by and large my concern.\n\n1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:17.600\n So you think the bad one might come from the flu,\n\n1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:18.720\n the influenza?\n\n1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:20.760\n Yeah, their replication cycle,\n\n1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:22.440\n they're able to genetically recombine\n\n1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:24.360\n in a way that coronaviruses aren't.\n\n1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:25.920\n They have segmented genomes,\n\n1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:27.480\n which means that they can just swap out\n\n1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:29.640\n whole parts of their genomes, no problem,\n\n1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:32.280\n repackage them, and then boom,\n\n1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:35.520\n you have a whole antigenic shift, not a drift.\n\n1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:38.120\n What that means is that on any occasion,\n\n1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:40.760\n any day of the year, you can have, boom,\n\n1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:44.440\n a whole new virus that didn't exist yesterday.\n\n1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:48.200\n And now with farming and industrial livestock,\n\n1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:53.440\n we're seeing animals and humans come into contact much more.\n\n1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:58.440\n Just the opportunities for an influenza strain\n\n1:34:58.840 --> 1:35:01.800\n that is unique and deadly to humans increases.\n\n1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.800\n All the while, transmission and mobility has increased.\n\n1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:08.880\n It's just a matter of time, in my opinion.\n\n1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:12.880\n What about from immunology perspective\n\n1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:16.320\n of the idea of engineering a virus?\n\n1:35:16.320 --> 1:35:18.720\n So not just the virus leaking from a lab or something,\n\n1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:23.560\n but actually being able to understand the protein,\n\n1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:26.560\n like everything about what makes a virus enough\n\n1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:31.560\n to be able to figure out ways to maybe target it\n\n1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:36.360\n or untarget it, attack biologics.\n\n1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:38.080\n Subverse immunity.\n\n1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:38.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:39.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:43.080\n Is that something, obviously that's somewhere\n\n1:35:43.080 --> 1:35:48.080\n on the list of concerns, but is that anywhere close\n\n1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:51.160\n of the top 10 highlights along with nuclear weapons\n\n1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:53.200\n and so on that we should be worried about?\n\n1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:55.640\n Or is the natural pandemic really the one\n\n1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:58.160\n that's much greater concern?\n\n1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:02.240\n I would say that the former, that manmade viruses\n\n1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:07.240\n and genetically engineered viruses should be right up there\n\n1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.720\n with the greatest concerns for humanity right now.\n\n1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:15.240\n We know that the tools, for better or worse,\n\n1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:19.720\n the tools for creating a virus are there.\n\n1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:20.600\n We can do it.\n\n1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:25.600\n And I mean, heck, the human species\n\n1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:28.160\n is no longer vaccinated against smallpox.\n\n1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:29.600\n I didn't get a smallpox vaccine.\n\n1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:32.160\n You didn't get a smallpox vaccine, at least I don't think.\n\n1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:37.040\n And so if somebody wanted to make smallpox\n\n1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:41.080\n and distribute it to the world in some way,\n\n1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:46.080\n it could be exceedingly deadly and detrimental to humans.\n\n1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:51.080\n And that's not even sort of using your imagination\n\n1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:52.240\n to create a new virus.\n\n1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:54.320\n That's one that we already have.\n\n1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:57.240\n Unlike the past when smallpox would circulate,\n\n1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:00.320\n you had large fractions of the community\n\n1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:01.840\n that was already immune to it.\n\n1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:03.880\n And so it wouldn't spread\n\n1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:05.320\n or it would spread a little bit slower.\n\n1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:07.160\n But now we have essentially in a few years,\n\n1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:10.640\n we'll have a whole global population that is susceptible.\n\n1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:12.960\n Let's look at measles.\n\n1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:17.960\n We have an entire, I mean, measles, I have,\n\n1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:20.400\n there are some researchers in the world right now,\n\n1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:23.880\n which for various reasons are working on creating\n\n1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:26.760\n a measles strain that evades immunity.\n\n1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:28.280\n It's not for bioterrorism,\n\n1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:29.760\n at least that's not the expectation.\n\n1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:33.680\n It's for using measles as an oncolytic virus to kill cancer.\n\n1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:36.880\n And the only way you can really do that\n\n1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:38.880\n is if your immune system doesn't,\n\n1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:41.640\n if you take a measles virus and there's,\n\n1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:43.880\n we don't have to go into the details of why it would work,\n\n1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:44.960\n but it could work.\n\n1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:48.200\n Measles likes to target potentially cancer cells.\n\n1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:51.840\n But to get your immune system not to kill off the virus\n\n1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:53.400\n if you're trying to use the virus to target it,\n\n1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:57.560\n you maybe want to make it blind to the immune system.\n\n1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:00.240\n But now imagine we took some virus like measles,\n\n1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.280\n which has an R naught of 18, transmits extremely quickly.\n\n1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:05.800\n And now we have essentially,\n\n1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:07.560\n let's say we had a whole human race\n\n1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:10.400\n that is susceptible to measles.\n\n1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:12.040\n And this is a virus that spreads\n\n1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:16.100\n orders of magnitude easier than this current virus.\n\n1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:20.960\n Imagine if you were to plug something toxic\n\n1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:24.960\n or detrimental into that virus and release it to the world.\n\n1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:29.360\n So it's possible to be both accidental and intentional.\n\n1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:30.200\n Absolutely.\n\n1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:32.560\n Yeah, so Mark Lipsitch is a good colleague of mine\n\n1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:35.920\n at Harvard, we're both in the,\n\n1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:37.000\n he's the director of the Center\n\n1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.800\n for Communicable Disease Dynamics from a faculty member.\n\n1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:42.960\n He's spoken very, very forcefully\n\n1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:47.200\n and he's very outspoken about the dangers\n\n1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:49.440\n of gain of function testing,\n\n1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:53.440\n where in the lab we are intentionally creating viruses\n\n1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:55.640\n that are exceedingly deadly\n\n1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:59.240\n under the auspices of trying to learn about them.\n\n1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:02.840\n So that if the idea is that if we kind of accelerate\n\n1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:07.120\n evolution and make these really deadly viruses in the lab,\n\n1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:11.240\n we can be prepared for if that virus ever comes about\n\n1:39:11.240 --> 1:39:14.580\n naturally or through unnatural means.\n\n1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:17.480\n The concern though is, okay, that's one thing,\n\n1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:20.940\n but what if that virus got out on somebody's shoe?\n\n1:39:20.940 --> 1:39:21.780\n Just what if?\n\n1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:29.840\n If the effects of an accident are potentially catastrophic,\n\n1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:33.580\n is it worth taking the chances just to be prepared\n\n1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:34.900\n a little bit for something that may\n\n1:39:34.900 --> 1:39:36.660\n or may not ever actually develop?\n\n1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:40.300\n And so it's a serious ethical quandary we're in,\n\n1:39:40.300 --> 1:39:43.060\n how to both be prepared,\n\n1:39:43.060 --> 1:39:48.060\n but also not cause a catastrophic mistake.\n\n1:39:49.700 --> 1:39:51.460\n As a small tangent,\n\n1:39:51.460 --> 1:39:55.220\n there's a recent really exciting breakthrough of alpha two,\n\n1:39:56.220 --> 1:39:59.300\n of alpha fold two solving protein folding\n\n1:39:59.300 --> 1:40:00.940\n or achieving state of the art performance\n\n1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:02.620\n on protein folding.\n\n1:40:02.620 --> 1:40:07.620\n And then I thought proteins have a lot to do with viruses.\n\n1:40:09.100 --> 1:40:14.100\n It seems like being able to use machine learning\n\n1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:19.540\n to design proteins that achieve certain kinds of functions\n\n1:40:19.540 --> 1:40:22.860\n will naturally allow you to use maybe down the line,\n\n1:40:22.860 --> 1:40:26.380\n not yet, but allow you to use machine learning\n\n1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:28.940\n to design basically viruses,\n\n1:40:28.940 --> 1:40:31.220\n maybe like measles, like for good,\n\n1:40:31.220 --> 1:40:35.820\n which is like to attack cancer cells, but also for bad.\n\n1:40:37.620 --> 1:40:42.620\n Is that a crazy thought\n\n1:40:43.460 --> 1:40:46.660\n or is this a natural place where this technology may go?\n\n1:40:46.660 --> 1:40:48.580\n I suppose as all technologies can,\n\n1:40:48.580 --> 1:40:52.020\n which is for good and for bad.\n\n1:40:52.020 --> 1:40:54.060\n Do you think about the role of machine learning in this?\n\n1:40:54.060 --> 1:40:59.060\n Oh yeah, absolutely, I mean, alpha fold is amazing.\n\n1:40:59.420 --> 1:41:03.580\n It's an amazing algorithm, a series of algorithms.\n\n1:41:03.580 --> 1:41:07.500\n And it does demonstrate, to me,\n\n1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:10.620\n it demonstrates just how powerful,\n\n1:41:10.620 --> 1:41:12.540\n everything in the world has rules.\n\n1:41:12.540 --> 1:41:13.980\n We just don't know the rules.\n\n1:41:13.980 --> 1:41:14.900\n We often don't know them,\n\n1:41:14.900 --> 1:41:17.860\n but our brain has rules, how it works.\n\n1:41:17.860 --> 1:41:19.220\n Everything is plus and minus.\n\n1:41:19.220 --> 1:41:21.220\n There's nothing in the world that's really not\n\n1:41:21.220 --> 1:41:25.260\n at its most basic level, positive, negative.\n\n1:41:25.260 --> 1:41:28.180\n It's all, obviously, it's all just charge.\n\n1:41:28.180 --> 1:41:30.300\n And that means everything.\n\n1:41:30.300 --> 1:41:32.900\n You can figure it out with enough computational power\n\n1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:34.980\n and enough, in this case, I mean,\n\n1:41:34.980 --> 1:41:39.980\n machine learning and AI is just one way to learn rules.\n\n1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:42.620\n It's an empirical way to learn rules,\n\n1:41:42.620 --> 1:41:44.940\n but it's a profoundly powerful way.\n\n1:41:44.940 --> 1:41:49.100\n And certainly, now that we are getting to a point\n\n1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.780\n where we can take a protein and know how it folds,\n\n1:41:54.180 --> 1:41:57.660\n given its sequence, we can reverse engineer that\n\n1:41:57.660 --> 1:42:01.580\n and we can say, okay, we want a protein to fold this way.\n\n1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:03.540\n What does the sequence need to be?\n\n1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:06.340\n We haven't done that yet so much,\n\n1:42:06.340 --> 1:42:09.500\n but it's just the next iteration of all of this.\n\n1:42:09.500 --> 1:42:12.740\n And so let's say somebody wants to develop a virus\n\n1:42:12.740 --> 1:42:15.340\n it's gonna start with somebody wanting to develop a virus\n\n1:42:15.340 --> 1:42:18.620\n to defeat cancer, something good.\n\n1:42:18.620 --> 1:42:20.780\n And so it would start with a lot of money\n\n1:42:20.780 --> 1:42:25.140\n from the federal government for all the positives\n\n1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:26.340\n that will come out of it.\n\n1:42:27.300 --> 1:42:29.900\n But we have to be really careful\n\n1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:32.300\n because that will come about.\n\n1:42:32.300 --> 1:42:35.220\n There's no doubt in my mind that we will develop,\n\n1:42:35.220 --> 1:42:36.060\n we're already doing it.\n\n1:42:36.060 --> 1:42:39.460\n We engineer molecules all the time for specific uses.\n\n1:42:39.460 --> 1:42:41.380\n Oftentimes, we take them from a lab\n\n1:42:41.380 --> 1:42:44.140\n and then we take them from a lab and then we make them.\n\n1:42:44.140 --> 1:42:47.100\n Oftentimes, we take them from nature and then tweak them.\n\n1:42:48.220 --> 1:42:49.860\n But now we can supercharge it.\n\n1:42:49.860 --> 1:42:53.340\n We can accelerate the pace of discovery.\n\n1:42:53.340 --> 1:42:54.940\n To not have it just be discovery,\n\n1:42:54.940 --> 1:42:58.180\n we have it be true ground up engineering.\n\n1:42:58.180 --> 1:43:02.460\n Let's say you're trying to make a new molecule\n\n1:43:02.460 --> 1:43:05.820\n to stabilize somebody with some retinal disease.\n\n1:43:06.820 --> 1:43:08.900\n So we come up with some molecule\n\n1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:12.180\n to stability of somebody with retinal degeneration.\n\n1:43:14.780 --> 1:43:16.260\n Just a small tweak to that,\n\n1:43:16.260 --> 1:43:18.460\n to say make a virus that causes the human race\n\n1:43:18.460 --> 1:43:20.020\n to become blind.\n\n1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:22.220\n I mean, it sounds really conspiracy theoryish,\n\n1:43:22.220 --> 1:43:25.860\n but it's not.\n\n1:43:25.860 --> 1:43:27.500\n We're learning so much about biology\n\n1:43:27.500 --> 1:43:28.820\n and there's always nefarious reasons.\n\n1:43:28.820 --> 1:43:33.820\n I mean, heck, look at how AI and just Google searches,\n\n1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:37.820\n those can be, they are every single day\n\n1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:39.940\n being leveraged by nefarious actors\n\n1:43:39.940 --> 1:43:43.180\n to take advantage of people, to steal money,\n\n1:43:43.180 --> 1:43:45.700\n to do whatever it might be.\n\n1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:48.300\n Eventually, probably to create wars\n\n1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:50.420\n or already to create wars.\n\n1:43:50.420 --> 1:43:53.700\n And I mean, I don't think there's any question at this point\n\n1:43:53.700 --> 1:43:55.500\n behind disinformation campaigns.\n\n1:43:55.500 --> 1:43:56.900\n And so it's being leveraged.\n\n1:43:56.900 --> 1:43:59.780\n This thing that could be wholly good\n\n1:44:00.700 --> 1:44:02.260\n is always going to be leveraged for bad.\n\n1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:04.580\n And so how do you balance that as a species?\n\n1:44:04.580 --> 1:44:06.300\n I'm not quite sure.\n\n1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:08.300\n The hope is, as you mentioned previously,\n\n1:44:08.300 --> 1:44:10.460\n that there's some, that we were able\n\n1:44:10.460 --> 1:44:12.300\n to also develop defense mechanisms.\n\n1:44:12.300 --> 1:44:14.100\n And there's something about the human species\n\n1:44:14.100 --> 1:44:18.700\n that seems to keep coming up with ways to,\n\n1:44:18.700 --> 1:44:21.580\n just like on the deadline,\n\n1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:22.780\n just at the last moment,\n\n1:44:22.780 --> 1:44:26.420\n figuring out how to avoid destruction.\n\n1:44:26.420 --> 1:44:30.940\n I think I'm eternally optimistic about the human race\n\n1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:32.780\n not destroying ourselves,\n\n1:44:32.780 --> 1:44:34.500\n but you could do a lot of things\n\n1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:36.060\n that would be very painful.\n\n1:44:36.060 --> 1:44:36.940\n Yes.\n\n1:44:36.940 --> 1:44:38.980\n Well, we're doing it already, just,\n\n1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:42.980\n I mean, we are seeing how our regulation today,\n\n1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:45.860\n we did this thing, it started as a good thing,\n\n1:44:45.860 --> 1:44:48.060\n regulation of medical products,\n\n1:44:48.060 --> 1:44:53.060\n but now it is unwillingly and unintentionally harming us.\n\n1:44:55.020 --> 1:44:57.220\n Our regulatory landscape,\n\n1:44:57.220 --> 1:45:00.540\n which was developed totally for good in our country\n\n1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:04.060\n is getting in the way of us deploying a tool\n\n1:45:04.060 --> 1:45:06.900\n that could stop our economies\n\n1:45:06.900 --> 1:45:11.020\n from having to be sort of sputteringly closed,\n\n1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:12.940\n that could stop deaths from happening\n\n1:45:12.940 --> 1:45:14.620\n at the rate that they are.\n\n1:45:14.620 --> 1:45:19.340\n And it's, I think we will come to a solution.\n\n1:45:19.340 --> 1:45:21.100\n Of course, now we're gonna get the vaccine\n\n1:45:21.100 --> 1:45:23.220\n and it's gonna make people lose track\n\n1:45:23.220 --> 1:45:25.940\n of like why we even bother testing, which is a bad idea.\n\n1:45:25.940 --> 1:45:28.220\n But we're already seeing that.\n\n1:45:28.220 --> 1:45:32.860\n We have this amazing capacity to both do damage\n\n1:45:32.860 --> 1:45:34.820\n when we don't intend to do damage\n\n1:45:36.060 --> 1:45:39.020\n and then also to pull up when we need to pull up\n\n1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:41.460\n and stop complete catastrophe.\n\n1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:46.100\n And so we are an interesting species in that way,\n\n1:45:46.100 --> 1:45:47.580\n that's for sure.\n\n1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:50.780\n So there's a lot of young folks, undergrads,\n\n1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:54.180\n grads, they're also young, listen to this.\n\n1:45:54.180 --> 1:45:57.540\n So is there, you've talked about a lot of fascinating stuff\n\n1:45:57.540 --> 1:46:01.900\n that's like, there's ways that things are done\n\n1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:03.540\n and there's actual solutions\n\n1:46:03.540 --> 1:46:05.860\n and they're not always like intersecting.\n\n1:46:05.860 --> 1:46:09.300\n Do you have advice for undergraduate students\n\n1:46:09.300 --> 1:46:12.980\n or graduate students or even people in high school now\n\n1:46:12.980 --> 1:46:17.780\n about a life, about a career of how they might be able\n\n1:46:17.780 --> 1:46:20.060\n to solve real big problems in the world,\n\n1:46:20.060 --> 1:46:22.140\n how they should live their life\n\n1:46:22.140 --> 1:46:24.180\n in order to have a chance to solve big problems\n\n1:46:24.180 --> 1:46:25.460\n in the world?\n\n1:46:25.460 --> 1:46:26.300\n It's hard.\n\n1:46:26.300 --> 1:46:28.580\n I struggle a little bit sometimes to give advice\n\n1:46:28.580 --> 1:46:30.060\n because the advice that I give\n\n1:46:30.060 --> 1:46:32.940\n from my own personal experience is necessarily distinct\n\n1:46:32.940 --> 1:46:36.580\n from the advice that would make other people successful.\n\n1:46:36.580 --> 1:46:41.580\n I have unending ambitions to make things better, I suppose.\n\n1:46:42.300 --> 1:46:44.460\n And I don't see barricades\n\n1:46:44.460 --> 1:46:46.980\n where other people sometimes see barricades.\n\n1:46:48.260 --> 1:46:51.700\n Now, even just little things like when this virus started,\n\n1:46:51.700 --> 1:46:54.420\n I'm a medical director at Brigham and Women's Hospital\n\n1:46:54.420 --> 1:46:56.180\n and so I oversee or helped oversee\n\n1:46:56.180 --> 1:46:58.100\n molecular virology diagnostics.\n\n1:46:58.100 --> 1:47:01.180\n So when this virus started, wearing my epidemiology hat\n\n1:47:01.180 --> 1:47:03.660\n and wearing my sort of viral outbreak hat,\n\n1:47:03.660 --> 1:47:05.780\n I recognized that this is gonna be a big virus\n\n1:47:05.780 --> 1:47:07.860\n that was important on a global level.\n\n1:47:07.860 --> 1:47:10.140\n Even if the CDC and WHO weren't ready to admit\n\n1:47:10.140 --> 1:47:10.980\n that it was a pandemic,\n\n1:47:10.980 --> 1:47:14.100\n it was obvious in January that it was a pandemic.\n\n1:47:14.100 --> 1:47:18.220\n So I started trying to get a test built at the Brigham,\n\n1:47:18.220 --> 1:47:20.540\n which is one of Harvard's teaching hospitals.\n\n1:47:20.540 --> 1:47:25.540\n The first encounters I had with the upper administration\n\n1:47:25.540 --> 1:47:28.460\n of the hospital were pretty much, no, why would we do that?\n\n1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:30.540\n That's silly, who are you?\n\n1:47:30.540 --> 1:47:33.900\n And I said, well, okay, don't believe me, sure.\n\n1:47:33.900 --> 1:47:35.780\n But I kept pushing on it.\n\n1:47:35.780 --> 1:47:38.740\n And then eventually I got them to agree.\n\n1:47:38.740 --> 1:47:40.700\n It was really only a couple of weeks\n\n1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:43.060\n before the Biogen conference happened.\n\n1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:44.460\n We started building the test.\n\n1:47:44.460 --> 1:47:46.140\n I think they started looking abroad and saying,\n\n1:47:46.140 --> 1:47:50.340\n okay, this is happening, sure, like, maybe he was right.\n\n1:47:50.340 --> 1:47:52.900\n But then I went a step further and I said,\n\n1:47:52.900 --> 1:47:55.740\n we're not gonna have enough tests at the hospital.\n\n1:47:55.740 --> 1:47:59.540\n And so my ambition was to get a better testing program\n\n1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:03.380\n started and so I figured what better place\n\n1:48:03.380 --> 1:48:06.060\n to scale up testing than the Broad Institute.\n\n1:48:06.060 --> 1:48:08.580\n Broad Institute is amazing, very high throughput,\n\n1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:10.580\n high efficiency research institute\n\n1:48:10.580 --> 1:48:13.460\n that does a lot of genomic sequencing, things like that.\n\n1:48:13.460 --> 1:48:15.300\n So I went to the Broad and I said,\n\n1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:17.340\n hey, there's this coronavirus\n\n1:48:17.340 --> 1:48:20.700\n that's obviously gonna impact our society greatly.\n\n1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:25.140\n Can we start modifying your high efficiency instruments\n\n1:48:25.140 --> 1:48:27.780\n and robots for coronavirus testing?\n\n1:48:27.780 --> 1:48:32.780\n Everyone in my orbit, in the hospital world,\n\n1:48:33.340 --> 1:48:35.340\n just said, that's ridiculous.\n\n1:48:35.340 --> 1:48:37.340\n How could you possibly plan to do that?\n\n1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:38.620\n It's impossible.\n\n1:48:38.620 --> 1:48:43.380\n And to me, it was like the most dead simple thing to do.\n\n1:48:43.380 --> 1:48:46.300\n It didn't, but the higher ups and the people\n\n1:48:46.300 --> 1:48:48.900\n who think about, I think one of the things\n\n1:48:48.900 --> 1:48:51.420\n is to recognize that most people in the world\n\n1:48:51.420 --> 1:48:53.620\n don't see solutions, they just see problems.\n\n1:48:53.620 --> 1:48:55.980\n And it's because it's an easy thing to do.\n\n1:48:55.980 --> 1:49:00.260\n Thinking of problems and how things will go wrong\n\n1:49:00.260 --> 1:49:03.140\n is really easy because you're not coming up\n\n1:49:03.140 --> 1:49:04.900\n with a brand new solution.\n\n1:49:04.900 --> 1:49:07.100\n And this to me was just a super simple solution.\n\n1:49:07.100 --> 1:49:09.500\n Hey, let's get the Broad to help build tests.\n\n1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:12.700\n Every single hospital director told me no,\n\n1:49:12.700 --> 1:49:13.540\n like it's impossible.\n\n1:49:13.540 --> 1:49:16.620\n My own superiors, the ones I report to in the hospital,\n\n1:49:16.620 --> 1:49:19.940\n said, you know, Mike, you're a new faculty member.\n\n1:49:20.980 --> 1:49:23.540\n Your ideas probably would be right,\n\n1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:27.620\n but you're too naive and young to know that it's impossible.\n\n1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:30.540\n Obviously now the Broad is the highest\n\n1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:32.380\n throughput laboratory in the country.\n\n1:49:32.380 --> 1:49:37.020\n And so I think my recommendation to people\n\n1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:40.260\n is as much as possible, get out of the mode\n\n1:49:40.260 --> 1:49:42.980\n of thinking about things as problems.\n\n1:49:42.980 --> 1:49:44.980\n Sometimes you piss people off,\n\n1:49:44.980 --> 1:49:47.180\n I could probably use a better filter sometimes\n\n1:49:47.180 --> 1:49:51.380\n to try to like be not so upfront with certain things.\n\n1:49:51.380 --> 1:49:54.700\n But it's just so crucial to always just see,\n\n1:49:54.700 --> 1:49:57.620\n to just bring it, like think about things in new ways\n\n1:49:57.620 --> 1:49:59.380\n that other people haven't.\n\n1:49:59.380 --> 1:50:01.300\n Cause usually there's something else out there.\n\n1:50:01.300 --> 1:50:04.100\n And one of the things that has been most beneficial to me,\n\n1:50:04.100 --> 1:50:07.940\n which is that my education was really broad.\n\n1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:10.220\n It was engineering and physics.\n\n1:50:10.220 --> 1:50:13.420\n And well, and then I became a Buddhist monk.\n\n1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:15.900\n Well, and then I became a Buddhist monk for a while.\n\n1:50:15.900 --> 1:50:18.540\n And so that gave me a different perspective,\n\n1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:20.820\n but then it was medicine and immunology.\n\n1:50:20.820 --> 1:50:23.100\n And now I've brought all of it together\n\n1:50:23.100 --> 1:50:27.780\n from a mathematics and biology and medicine perspective\n\n1:50:27.780 --> 1:50:29.100\n and policy and public health.\n\n1:50:29.100 --> 1:50:30.180\n And I think that, you know,\n\n1:50:30.180 --> 1:50:32.940\n I'm not the best in any one of these things.\n\n1:50:32.940 --> 1:50:36.100\n I recognize that there are gonna be geniuses out there\n\n1:50:36.100 --> 1:50:37.660\n who are just worlds better than me\n\n1:50:37.660 --> 1:50:41.660\n at any one of these things that I try to work on.\n\n1:50:41.660 --> 1:50:43.980\n But my superpower is bringing them all together,\n\n1:50:43.980 --> 1:50:45.020\n you know, and just thinking,\n\n1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:48.600\n and that's, I think how you can really change the world.\n\n1:50:49.780 --> 1:50:51.540\n You know, I don't know that I'll ever change the world\n\n1:50:51.540 --> 1:50:53.820\n in the way that I hope.\n\n1:50:53.820 --> 1:50:55.340\n But that's how you can have a chance.\n\n1:50:55.340 --> 1:50:57.100\n Yeah, that's how you can have a chance, exactly.\n\n1:50:57.100 --> 1:51:01.380\n And I think it's also what, you know, this to me,\n\n1:51:01.380 --> 1:51:02.700\n this rapid testing program,\n\n1:51:02.700 --> 1:51:06.220\n like this is the most dead simple solution in the world.\n\n1:51:06.220 --> 1:51:07.660\n And this literally could change the world.\n\n1:51:07.660 --> 1:51:08.500\n It could change the world.\n\n1:51:08.500 --> 1:51:09.620\n It could change, and it is, you know,\n\n1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:11.180\n there's countries that are doing it now.\n\n1:51:11.180 --> 1:51:13.980\n The US isn't, but I've been advising many countries on it.\n\n1:51:13.980 --> 1:51:16.980\n And I would say that, you know,\n\n1:51:16.980 --> 1:51:19.860\n some of the early papers that we put out earlier on,\n\n1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:22.300\n a lot of the things actually are changing.\n\n1:51:22.300 --> 1:51:24.180\n You don't always, unless you really look hard,\n\n1:51:24.180 --> 1:51:26.740\n you don't know where you're actually having an effect.\n\n1:51:26.740 --> 1:51:29.620\n Sometimes it's more overt than other times.\n\n1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:33.260\n In April, I published a paper that was saying,\n\n1:51:33.260 --> 1:51:36.580\n hey, with the PCR values from these tests,\n\n1:51:36.580 --> 1:51:38.580\n we need to really focus on the CT values,\n\n1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:39.860\n the actual quantitative values\n\n1:51:39.860 --> 1:51:42.540\n of these lab based PCR tests.\n\n1:51:42.540 --> 1:51:46.020\n At the time, all the physicians and laboratory directors\n\n1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:46.980\n told me that was stupid.\n\n1:51:46.980 --> 1:51:48.140\n You know, why would you do that?\n\n1:51:48.140 --> 1:51:49.500\n They're not accurate enough.\n\n1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:52.900\n And of course, now it's headline news that, you know,\n\n1:51:52.900 --> 1:51:56.380\n Florida, they just mandated reporting out the CT values\n\n1:51:56.380 --> 1:51:58.940\n of these tests, cause there's a real utility of them.\n\n1:51:58.940 --> 1:52:00.500\n You can understand public health from it.\n\n1:52:00.500 --> 1:52:03.580\n You can understand better clinical management.\n\n1:52:03.580 --> 1:52:05.140\n You know, that was a simple solution\n\n1:52:05.140 --> 1:52:07.440\n to a pretty difficult problem.\n\n1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:09.000\n And it is changing.\n\n1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.040\n The way that we approach all of the lab testing\n\n1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:13.600\n in this country is starting to, it's taken a few months,\n\n1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:15.560\n but it's starting to change because of that.\n\n1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:18.360\n And, you know, that was just me saying,\n\n1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:20.480\n hey, this is something we should be focusing on.\n\n1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:22.840\n Got some other people involved and other people.\n\n1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:26.200\n And now people recognize, hey, there's actual value\n\n1:52:26.200 --> 1:52:29.200\n in this number that comes out of these lab based PCR tests.\n\n1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:32.120\n So sometimes it does grow fairly quickly.\n\n1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:35.360\n But I think the real answer,\n\n1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:38.280\n if my only answer, I don't know what, you know,\n\n1:52:38.280 --> 1:52:40.120\n I recognize that everyone, some people are gonna be\n\n1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:45.120\n really focused on and have one small, but deep skillset.\n\n1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:46.360\n I go the opposite direction.\n\n1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:48.760\n I try to bring things together.\n\n1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:52.200\n And, but the biggest thing I think is just,\n\n1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:55.960\n don't see barriers, like just see,\n\n1:52:55.960 --> 1:52:58.200\n like there's always a solution to a barrier.\n\n1:52:58.200 --> 1:52:59.040\n If there's a barrier,\n\n1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:01.480\n that literally means there's a solution to it.\n\n1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:02.560\n That's why it's called a barrier.\n\n1:53:02.560 --> 1:53:06.160\n And just like you said, most people will just present to you,\n\n1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:09.320\n only be thinking about it and present to you with barriers.\n\n1:53:09.320 --> 1:53:10.800\n And so it's easy to start thinking\n\n1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:12.800\n that's all there is in this world.\n\n1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:13.640\n And just think big.\n\n1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:15.960\n I mean, God, you know, there's nothing wrong\n\n1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:17.280\n with thinking big.\n\n1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:19.040\n Elon Musk thought big and, you know,\n\n1:53:19.040 --> 1:53:21.800\n and then thinking big builds on itself.\n\n1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:25.240\n You know, you get a billion dollars from one big idea\n\n1:53:25.240 --> 1:53:27.800\n and then that allows you to make three new big ideas.\n\n1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:29.840\n And there's a hunger for it if you think big\n\n1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:32.040\n and you communicate that vision with the world.\n\n1:53:32.040 --> 1:53:35.240\n All the most brilliant and like passionate people\n\n1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:37.720\n will just like, you'll attract them\n\n1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:38.720\n and they'll come to you.\n\n1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:41.440\n And then it makes your life actually really exciting.\n\n1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:45.240\n The people I've met at like Tesla and Neuralink,\n\n1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:47.200\n I mean, there's just like this fire in their eyes.\n\n1:53:47.200 --> 1:53:48.200\n They just love life.\n\n1:53:48.200 --> 1:53:52.200\n And it's amazing, I think, to be around those people.\n\n1:53:53.520 --> 1:53:57.720\n I have to ask you about what was the philosophy,\n\n1:53:57.720 --> 1:54:01.200\n the journey that took you to becoming a Buddhist monk\n\n1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:06.200\n and what did you learn about life?\n\n1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:09.080\n What did you take away from that experience?\n\n1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:12.320\n How did you return back to Harvard\n\n1:54:12.320 --> 1:54:17.320\n and the world that's unlike that experience, I imagine?\n\n1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:19.520\n Yeah, well, I was at Dartmouth at the time.\n\n1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:23.320\n Well, I went to Sri Lanka.\n\n1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:25.800\n I was already pretty interested in developing countries\n\n1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:27.440\n and sort of under resourced areas.\n\n1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:30.680\n And I was doing a lot of engineering work\n\n1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:33.440\n and I went there, but I was also starting to think\n\n1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:35.760\n maybe health was something of interest.\n\n1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:40.840\n And so I went to Sri Lanka\n\n1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:43.520\n because I had a long interest in Buddhism as well,\n\n1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:46.640\n just kind of interested in it as a thing.\n\n1:54:46.640 --> 1:54:49.200\n Which aspect of the philosophy attracted you?\n\n1:54:49.200 --> 1:54:52.520\n I would say that the thing that interested me most\n\n1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:57.080\n was really this idea of kind of a butterfly effect\n\n1:54:57.080 --> 1:55:02.080\n of like what you do now has ripple effects\n\n1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:06.320\n that extend out beyond what you can possibly imagine,\n\n1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:10.640\n both in your own life and in other people's lives.\n\n1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:13.160\n And in some ways, Buddhism has, not in some ways,\n\n1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:14.960\n in a pretty deep way, Buddhism has that\n\n1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:18.800\n as part of its underlying philosophy\n\n1:55:18.800 --> 1:55:23.000\n in terms of rebirth and sort of your actions today\n\n1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.280\n propagate to others, but also propagate\n\n1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:30.800\n to sort of what might happen in your circle\n\n1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:32.640\n of what's called samsara and rebirth.\n\n1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:36.640\n And I don't know that I subscribe fully\n\n1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:39.880\n to this idea that we are reborn,\n\n1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:44.840\n which always was a little bit of a debate internally,\n\n1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:46.360\n I suppose, when I was a monk.\n\n1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:50.480\n But it has always been, it was that\n\n1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:52.560\n and then it was also meditation.\n\n1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:55.440\n At the time I was a fairly elite rower.\n\n1:55:55.440 --> 1:55:57.880\n I was rowing at the national level\n\n1:55:57.880 --> 1:56:01.640\n and rowing to me was very meditative.\n\n1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:06.640\n It was just, even if you're in a boat with other people,\n\n1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:09.560\n I mean, on the one hand, it's like the extreme\n\n1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:13.160\n of like a team sport, but it's also the extreme\n\n1:56:13.160 --> 1:56:16.800\n sort of focus and concentration that's required of it.\n\n1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:18.880\n And so I was always really into just meditative\n\n1:56:18.880 --> 1:56:19.720\n type of things.\n\n1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:20.920\n I was doing a lot of pottery too,\n\n1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:22.480\n which was also very meditative.\n\n1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:25.720\n And so Buddhism just kind of really,\n\n1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:28.440\n there are a lot of things about meditating\n\n1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:30.480\n that just appealed.\n\n1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:32.400\n And so I moved to Sri Lanka,\n\n1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:35.680\n planning to only be there for a couple of months.\n\n1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:37.760\n And then I was shadowing in this medical clinic\n\n1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:40.360\n and there was this physician who was just really,\n\n1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:43.080\n I mean, it's just kind of a horrible situation.\n\n1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:46.040\n Frankly, this guy was trained decades earlier.\n\n1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:49.600\n He was an older physician and he was still just practicing\n\n1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:52.520\n like these fairly barbaric approaches to medicine\n\n1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:54.680\n because he was a rural town\n\n1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:57.240\n and he just didn't have a lot of,\n\n1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:00.680\n he didn't have any updated training, frankly.\n\n1:57:00.680 --> 1:57:03.680\n And so, I just remember this like girl came in\n\n1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:05.920\n with like shrapnel in her hand\n\n1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:08.760\n and his solution was to like air it out.\n\n1:57:08.760 --> 1:57:12.440\n And so he was like, without even numbing her hand,\n\n1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:16.680\n he was like cutting it open more with this idea\n\n1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:20.040\n that like the more oxygen and stuff.\n\n1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:23.000\n And it just, I think there was something about all of this.\n\n1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.520\n And I was already talking to these monks at the time.\n\n1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:28.760\n I would be in this clinic in the morning and I'd go\n\n1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:31.520\n and my idea was to teach English\n\n1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:33.080\n to these monks in the evening.\n\n1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:37.080\n Turned out I'm a really bad English teacher.\n\n1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:40.440\n So they just taught, they allowed me just to sit with them\n\n1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:42.960\n and meditate and they were teaching me more about Buddhism\n\n1:57:42.960 --> 1:57:44.800\n than I could have possibly taught them about English\n\n1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:46.720\n or being an American or something.\n\n1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:52.800\n And so I just slowly, I just couldn't take,\n\n1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:55.240\n I like couldn't handle being in that clinic.\n\n1:57:55.240 --> 1:57:57.320\n So more and more, I just started moving to,\n\n1:57:57.320 --> 1:57:59.440\n spending more and more time at this monastery.\n\n1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:00.760\n And then after about two months,\n\n1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:02.200\n I was supposed to come back to the States\n\n1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:04.160\n and I decided I didn't want to.\n\n1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:06.400\n So I moved to this monastery in the mountains\n\n1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:09.160\n primarily because I didn't have the money\n\n1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:11.200\n to like just keep living.\n\n1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:13.560\n So living in a monastery is free.\n\n1:58:13.560 --> 1:58:16.240\n And so I moved there and just started meditating\n\n1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:17.680\n more and more and then months went by\n\n1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:22.160\n and it just really gravitated.\n\n1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:24.840\n I gravitated to the whole notion of it.\n\n1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:28.440\n I mean, it became, it sounds strange,\n\n1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:30.720\n but meditating almost just like anything\n\n1:58:30.720 --> 1:58:34.600\n that you've put your mind to became exciting.\n\n1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:36.520\n It became like there weren't enough hours\n\n1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:38.120\n in the day to meditate.\n\n1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:41.800\n And I would do it for 18 hours a day, 15 hours a day,\n\n1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:46.160\n just sit there and you, and like,\n\n1:58:46.160 --> 1:58:48.520\n I mean, I hate sleeping anyway,\n\n1:58:48.520 --> 1:58:49.880\n but I wouldn't want to go to sleep\n\n1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:51.440\n because I felt like I didn't accomplish\n\n1:58:51.440 --> 1:58:54.120\n what I needed to accomplish in meditation that day,\n\n1:58:54.120 --> 1:58:57.000\n which is so strange because there is no end,\n\n1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.000\n but it was always, but there are these,\n\n1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:02.800\n there are these steps that happen during meditation\n\n1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:05.160\n that are very prescribed in a way.\n\n1:59:05.160 --> 1:59:08.080\n Buddha talked about them and these are ancient writings,\n\n1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:08.920\n which exist.\n\n1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:09.840\n I mean, the writings are real.\n\n1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:11.240\n They're thousands of years old now.\n\n1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:16.240\n And so whether it was Buddha writing them or whoever,\n\n1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:17.760\n there are lots of different people\n\n1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:20.600\n who have contributed to these writings over the years.\n\n1:59:22.200 --> 1:59:23.520\n But they're very prescribed\n\n1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:26.880\n and they tell you what you're gonna go through.\n\n1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:29.040\n And I didn't really focus too much on them.\n\n1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:31.240\n I read a little bit about them,\n\n1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:32.400\n but your mind really does.\n\n1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:35.160\n When you actually start meditating at that level,\n\n1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:36.440\n like not an hour here and there,\n\n1:59:36.440 --> 1:59:39.560\n but like truly just spending your day as meditating,\n\n1:59:39.560 --> 1:59:42.320\n it becomes kind of like this other world\n\n1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:47.320\n where it becomes exciting and you're actively working,\n\n1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:49.400\n you're actively meditating,\n\n1:59:49.400 --> 1:59:51.200\n not just kind of trying to quiet things.\n\n1:59:51.200 --> 1:59:53.360\n That's sort of just the first stage\n\n1:59:53.360 --> 1:59:54.960\n of trying to get your mind to focus.\n\n1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:56.800\n Most people never get past that first stage,\n\n1:59:56.800 --> 1:59:58.680\n especially in our culture.\n\n1:59:58.680 --> 2:00:00.560\n Could you briefly summarize\n\n2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:03.960\n what's waiting beyond the stage of just quieting the mind?\n\n2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:08.320\n It's hard for me to imagine that there's something\n\n2:00:08.320 --> 2:00:12.320\n that could be described as exciting on there.\n\n2:00:12.320 --> 2:00:14.600\n Yeah, it's an interesting question.\n\n2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:18.080\n So I would say, so the first thing,\n\n2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:20.360\n the first step is truly just to like be able\n\n2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:23.040\n to close your eyes, focus on your breath\n\n2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:26.240\n and not have other thoughts enter into your mind.\n\n2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:28.320\n That alone is just so hard to do.\n\n2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:33.320\n Like I couldn't do it now if I wanted, but I could then.\n\n2:00:33.320 --> 2:00:38.320\n But once you get past that stage,\n\n2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:41.600\n you start entering into like all these other,\n\n2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:42.520\n you go through the kind of,\n\n2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.640\n I went through this like pretty trippy stage,\n\n2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:46.240\n which is a little bit euphoric\n\n2:00:47.600 --> 2:00:49.800\n where you just kind of start not hallucinating.\n\n2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:51.440\n I mean, it wasn't like some crazy thing\n\n2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:53.080\n that would happen in a movie,\n\n2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:55.320\n but definitely just weird.\n\n2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:56.720\n You start getting into the stage\n\n2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:01.720\n where you're able to quiet your mind for so long,\n\n2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:04.640\n for hours at a time that like for me,\n\n2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:07.640\n I started getting really excited\n\n2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:09.640\n about this idea of mindfulness,\n\n2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:11.760\n which is part of Buddhism in general,\n\n2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:13.760\n but it's part of Theravada Buddhism in particular\n\n2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:18.160\n for this in this way, which was you take,\n\n2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:21.600\n you start focusing on your daily activities,\n\n2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:25.280\n whether that's sipping a cup of tea or walking\n\n2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:29.520\n or sweeping around.\n\n2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:32.360\n I lived on this mountainside in this cottage thing,\n\n2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:33.440\n it was built into the rock.\n\n2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:36.280\n And so every morning I would wake up early\n\n2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:37.600\n and sweep around it and stuff,\n\n2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:39.160\n cause that's just what we did.\n\n2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:44.000\n And you start to, you meditate on all those activities.\n\n2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.240\n And one of the things that was so exciting,\n\n2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:48.720\n which sounds completely ridiculous now\n\n2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:53.720\n was just almost learning about your daily activities\n\n2:01:54.200 --> 2:01:56.880\n in ways that you never would have thought about before.\n\n2:01:56.880 --> 2:02:01.880\n So what's involved with like picking up this glass of water?\n\n2:02:03.640 --> 2:02:05.120\n If I said, okay, I'm just gonna pick,\n\n2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:06.840\n I'm gonna take a drink of water,\n\n2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:09.160\n to me right now, it's a single activity.\n\n2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:15.800\n But during meditation, it's not a single activity.\n\n2:02:16.360 --> 2:02:18.160\n It's a whole series of activities\n\n2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:21.960\n of like little engineering feats and feelings.\n\n2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:24.240\n And it's gripping the water\n\n2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:25.960\n and it's feeling that the glass is cold\n\n2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:29.280\n and it's lifting and it's moving and dragging and dragging.\n\n2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:34.200\n And you start to learn a whole new language of life.\n\n2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:37.560\n And that to me was like this really exhilarating thing\n\n2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:41.320\n that it was an exhilarating component of meditation\n\n2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:43.680\n that there was never enough time.\n\n2:02:44.520 --> 2:02:46.360\n It's kind of like learning a new computer language.\n\n2:02:46.360 --> 2:02:48.280\n Like it gets really exciting when you start coding\n\n2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:50.480\n and all these new things you can do.\n\n2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:55.400\n You learn how to experience life in a much richer way.\n\n2:02:55.400 --> 2:02:57.000\n And so you never run out of ways\n\n2:02:57.000 --> 2:02:58.840\n to go deeper and deeper and deeper\n\n2:02:58.840 --> 2:03:00.480\n in the way you experienced even just\n\n2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:02.360\n the drinking of the glass of water.\n\n2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:03.280\n That's exactly right.\n\n2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:05.040\n And what becomes kind of exhilarating\n\n2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:07.640\n is you start to be able to predict things\n\n2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:09.280\n that you never are,\n\n2:03:09.280 --> 2:03:11.180\n I don't even have predictions, right word.\n\n2:03:11.180 --> 2:03:13.000\n But I always think of the matrix,\n\n2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.200\n where I forget who it was,\n\n2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:17.880\n somebody was shooting at Neo\n\n2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:21.080\n and he like leans backwards and he dodges the bullets.\n\n2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:24.420\n In some ways, when you start breaking\n\n2:03:24.420 --> 2:03:26.200\n every little action that your hands do\n\n2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:27.800\n or that your feet do or that your body does\n\n2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:29.520\n down into all these little actions\n\n2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:33.340\n that make up one what we normally think of as an action,\n\n2:03:33.340 --> 2:03:35.360\n all of a sudden you can start to see things\n\n2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:37.080\n almost in slow motion.\n\n2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:40.280\n I like to think of it very much like language.\n\n2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:42.720\n The first time somebody hears a foreign language,\n\n2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:45.960\n it sounds really fast usually.\n\n2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:48.960\n You don't hear the spaces between words.\n\n2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:53.960\n And it just sounds like a stream of consciousness.\n\n2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:55.680\n And it just sounds like a stream of noises\n\n2:03:55.680 --> 2:03:57.040\n if you've never heard the language before.\n\n2:03:57.040 --> 2:03:58.740\n And as you learn the language,\n\n2:03:58.740 --> 2:04:01.200\n you hear clear breaks between words\n\n2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:02.800\n and it starts to gain context.\n\n2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:04.320\n And all of a sudden like that,\n\n2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:09.320\n what once sounded very fast slows down and it has meaning.\n\n2:04:10.160 --> 2:04:11.440\n That's our whole life.\n\n2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:13.040\n Well, there's this whole language happening\n\n2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:15.540\n that we don't speak generally.\n\n2:04:15.540 --> 2:04:17.140\n But if you start to speak it\n\n2:04:17.140 --> 2:04:19.840\n and if you start to learn it and you start to say,\n\n2:04:19.840 --> 2:04:21.060\n hey, I'm picking up this glass\n\n2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:24.060\n is actually 18 little movements.\n\n2:04:24.060 --> 2:04:27.280\n Then all of a sudden it becomes extremely exciting\n\n2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:29.460\n and exhilarating to just breathe.\n\n2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:31.640\n Breathing alone and the rise and fall of your abdomen\n\n2:04:31.640 --> 2:04:34.120\n or the way the air pushes in and out of your nose\n\n2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:36.640\n becomes almost interesting.\n\n2:04:37.640 --> 2:04:41.520\n And what's really neat is the world just starts slowing down\n\n2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:44.120\n and I'll never forget that feeling.\n\n2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:47.140\n And if there was one euphoric feeling from meditation\n\n2:04:47.140 --> 2:04:48.960\n I want to gain back,\n\n2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:51.560\n but I don't think I could without really meditating\n\n2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:54.400\n like that again and I don't think I will,\n\n2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:57.040\n was this like slow motion of the world.\n\n2:04:57.040 --> 2:05:01.440\n It was finding the spaces between all the movements\n\n2:05:01.440 --> 2:05:04.680\n in the same way that the spaces between all the words happen.\n\n2:05:04.680 --> 2:05:06.960\n And then it almost gives you this new appreciation\n\n2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:10.160\n for everything, it was really amazing.\n\n2:05:10.160 --> 2:05:14.240\n And so I think it came to an abrupt end though\n\n2:05:14.240 --> 2:05:15.440\n when the tsunami hit.\n\n2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:19.580\n I was there in the Indian Ocean tsunami hit in 2004.\n\n2:05:19.580 --> 2:05:22.220\n And it was like this dichotomy of being a monk\n\n2:05:22.220 --> 2:05:26.640\n and just meditating in this extraordinary place.\n\n2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:30.700\n And then the tsunami hits and kills 40,000 people\n\n2:05:30.700 --> 2:05:32.280\n in a few minutes on the coast\n\n2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:34.920\n of this really small little country in Sri Lanka.\n\n2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:39.920\n And then my whole world of being a monk\n\n2:05:40.440 --> 2:05:41.820\n came crashing down.\n\n2:05:41.820 --> 2:05:46.160\n And when I go to the coast,\n\n2:05:46.160 --> 2:05:51.160\n and I mean, that was just a devastating visual sight\n\n2:05:53.420 --> 2:05:54.520\n and emotional sight.\n\n2:05:54.520 --> 2:05:56.540\n But the strangest thing happened,\n\n2:05:56.540 --> 2:05:59.620\n which was that everyone just wanted me to stay as a monk.\n\n2:05:59.620 --> 2:06:02.500\n You know, people in that culture, they wanted to,\n\n2:06:03.780 --> 2:06:07.140\n the monks largely fled from the coastlines those,\n\n2:06:07.140 --> 2:06:09.740\n you know, and so then there I was\n\n2:06:09.740 --> 2:06:11.300\n and people wanted me to be a monk.\n\n2:06:11.300 --> 2:06:12.300\n They wanted me to stay on the coast,\n\n2:06:12.300 --> 2:06:14.420\n but be a monk and not help,\n\n2:06:14.420 --> 2:06:17.700\n like not help in the way that I considered helping.\n\n2:06:18.740 --> 2:06:20.560\n They wanted me just to keep meditating\n\n2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:23.380\n so that they could bring me offerings\n\n2:06:23.380 --> 2:06:27.000\n and have their sort of karmic responsibilities\n\n2:06:28.460 --> 2:06:29.380\n attended to as well.\n\n2:06:29.380 --> 2:06:32.540\n And so that was really bizarre to me.\n\n2:06:32.540 --> 2:06:36.420\n It was like, how could I possibly just sit around\n\n2:06:36.420 --> 2:06:40.300\n while all these people, half of everyone's family just died?\n\n2:06:40.300 --> 2:06:44.060\n And so in any case, I stopped being a monk\n\n2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:45.540\n and I moved to this refugee camp\n\n2:06:45.540 --> 2:06:47.420\n and lived there for another six months or so\n\n2:06:47.420 --> 2:06:52.420\n and just stayed there, not as a monk,\n\n2:06:54.580 --> 2:06:56.620\n but tried to raise some money from the US\n\n2:06:56.620 --> 2:06:58.920\n and tried to like, I didn't know what I was doing.\n\n2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:01.260\n Frankly, I was 22.\n\n2:07:03.460 --> 2:07:06.180\n And I don't think I appreciated at the time\n\n2:07:06.180 --> 2:07:10.520\n how much of a role I was having in that community's life.\n\n2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:14.660\n But it's taken me many years to process all of this\n\n2:07:14.660 --> 2:07:17.580\n since then, but I would say it's what put me\n\n2:07:17.580 --> 2:07:21.100\n into the public health world, living in that refugee camp.\n\n2:07:21.100 --> 2:07:22.900\n And that difference that happened,\n\n2:07:22.900 --> 2:07:26.900\n from being a monk to being in this devastating environment\n\n2:07:28.300 --> 2:07:30.140\n just really changed my whole view\n\n2:07:30.140 --> 2:07:34.680\n of sort of why I was existing, I suppose.\n\n2:07:34.680 --> 2:07:39.680\n Well, so there's this richness of life\n\n2:07:40.060 --> 2:07:42.700\n in a single drink of water that you experience,\n\n2:07:42.700 --> 2:07:46.180\n and then there's this power of nature\n\n2:07:46.180 --> 2:07:50.100\n that's capable to take the lives of thousands of people.\n\n2:07:50.100 --> 2:07:52.520\n So given all that, the absurdity of that,\n\n2:07:54.020 --> 2:07:58.180\n let me ask you, and the fact that you study things\n\n2:07:58.180 --> 2:08:01.220\n that could kill the entirety of human civilization,\n\n2:08:01.220 --> 2:08:03.860\n what do you think is the meaning of this all?\n\n2:08:03.860 --> 2:08:05.540\n What do you think is the meaning of life,\n\n2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:08.060\n this whole orchestra we've got going on?\n\n2:08:08.060 --> 2:08:09.940\n Does it have a meaning?\n\n2:08:09.940 --> 2:08:12.700\n And maybe from another perspective,\n\n2:08:15.020 --> 2:08:19.120\n how does one live a meaningful life, if such is possible?\n\n2:08:22.500 --> 2:08:24.560\n Well, from what I've seen,\n\n2:08:26.100 --> 2:08:29.060\n I don't think there's a single answer to that by any stretch.\n\n2:08:29.060 --> 2:08:32.300\n One of the most interesting things about Buddhism to me\n\n2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:35.860\n is that the human existence is part of suffering,\n\n2:08:36.860 --> 2:08:40.980\n which is very different from Judeo Christian existence,\n\n2:08:40.980 --> 2:08:45.980\n which is that human existence is something to be,\n\n2:08:47.620 --> 2:08:50.220\n is a very different, it's something to,\n\n2:08:50.220 --> 2:08:51.740\n there's a richness to it.\n\n2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:55.460\n In Buddhism, it's just another one of your lives,\n\n2:08:55.460 --> 2:08:59.660\n but it's your opportunity to attain nirvana\n\n2:08:59.660 --> 2:09:02.420\n and become a monk, for example, and meditate\n\n2:09:02.420 --> 2:09:03.500\n to attain nirvana,\n\n2:09:04.580 --> 2:09:06.820\n else you kind of just go back into the samsara,\n\n2:09:06.820 --> 2:09:09.180\n the cycle of suffering.\n\n2:09:09.180 --> 2:09:14.180\n And so, when I look at, I mean, in some ways,\n\n2:09:14.180 --> 2:09:17.960\n the notion of life and what the purpose of life is,\n\n2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:20.940\n they're kind of completely distinct,\n\n2:09:20.940 --> 2:09:22.980\n this sort of Western view of life,\n\n2:09:22.980 --> 2:09:27.220\n which is that this life is the most precious thing\n\n2:09:27.220 --> 2:09:30.460\n in the world versus this is just another opportunity\n\n2:09:30.460 --> 2:09:33.300\n to try to get out of life.\n\n2:09:33.300 --> 2:09:35.880\n I mean, the whole notion of nirvana, and in Buddhism,\n\n2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:40.100\n it getting out of this sort of cycle of suffering\n\n2:09:40.100 --> 2:09:41.380\n is to vanish.\n\n2:09:41.380 --> 2:09:45.680\n If you could attain nirvana throughout this life,\n\n2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:48.660\n the idea is that you don't get reborn.\n\n2:09:48.660 --> 2:09:51.340\n And so, when I look at these two,\n\n2:09:51.340 --> 2:09:55.100\n on the one hand, you have Christian faith\n\n2:09:55.100 --> 2:09:57.160\n and other things that want to go to heaven\n\n2:09:57.160 --> 2:09:58.920\n and live forever in heaven.\n\n2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:01.260\n Then you have this other whole half of humans\n\n2:10:01.260 --> 2:10:05.740\n who want nothing more than to get out of the cycle\n\n2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:09.100\n of rebirth and just, poof, not exist anymore.\n\n2:10:09.100 --> 2:10:10.300\n The cycle of suffering, yeah.\n\n2:10:10.300 --> 2:10:12.500\n Yeah, and so how do you reconcile those two?\n\n2:10:12.500 --> 2:10:13.620\n And I guess.\n\n2:10:13.620 --> 2:10:15.760\n Do you have both of them in you?\n\n2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:18.020\n Do you basically oscillate back and forth?\n\n2:10:18.020 --> 2:10:19.860\n I don't think I, I think I just,\n\n2:10:19.860 --> 2:10:23.080\n I look at us and I think we're just a bunch of proteins.\n\n2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:28.080\n That we form and we, they work in this really amazing way\n\n2:10:29.560 --> 2:10:31.400\n and they might work in a bigger scale.\n\n2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:33.800\n There might be some connections\n\n2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:35.400\n that we're not really clear about,\n\n2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:36.560\n but they're still biological.\n\n2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:38.360\n I believe that they're biological.\n\n2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:40.600\n How did these proteins become conscious\n\n2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:43.600\n and why do they want to help civilization\n\n2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:47.640\n by having at home rapid tests at scale?\n\n2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:50.840\n Well, I think, I don't have an answer to that one,\n\n2:10:50.840 --> 2:10:53.440\n but I really do believe. I was hoping you would.\n\n2:10:53.440 --> 2:10:56.320\n It's just, you know, this is just an evolution\n\n2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:01.320\n of consciousness I don't, I don't personally think is,\n\n2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:05.400\n my feeling is that we're a bunch of pluses and minuses\n\n2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:07.160\n that have just gotten so complex\n\n2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:10.880\n that they're able to make rich feelings, rich emotions.\n\n2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:13.680\n And I do believe though, you know, on the one hand,\n\n2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:15.760\n I sometimes wake up some days,\n\n2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:18.700\n my fiance doesn't always love it,\n\n2:11:18.700 --> 2:11:20.160\n but you know, I kind of think we're all just a bunch\n\n2:11:20.160 --> 2:11:23.400\n of robots with like pretty complicated algorithms\n\n2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:24.320\n that we deal with.\n\n2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:28.680\n And, you know, in that sense, like, okay,\n\n2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:30.960\n if the world just blew up tomorrow\n\n2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:35.360\n and nothing existed the day after that,\n\n2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:37.920\n it's just another blip in the universe, you know?\n\n2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:40.100\n But at the same time, I don't know.\n\n2:11:40.100 --> 2:11:42.460\n So that's kind of probably my most core basic feeling\n\n2:11:42.460 --> 2:11:45.520\n about life is like, we're just a blip\n\n2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:47.320\n and we may as well make the most of it\n\n2:11:47.320 --> 2:11:48.620\n while we're here blipping.\n\n2:11:48.620 --> 2:11:52.280\n It's one hell of a fun blip though.\n\n2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:57.280\n It is, it's an amazing blink of an eye in time.\n\n2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:01.640\n Michael, this is, you're one of the most interesting people\n\n2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:03.920\n I've met, one of the most interesting conversations,\n\n2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:07.400\n important ones now, I'm going to publish it very soon.\n\n2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:09.720\n I really appreciate taking the time,\n\n2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:12.920\n I know how busy you are, it was really fun.\n\n2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.100\n Thanks for talking today.\n\n2:12:14.100 --> 2:12:16.440\n Well, thanks so much, this was a lot of fun.\n\n2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:19.420\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:22.260\n with Michael Mina and thank you to our sponsors.\n\n2:12:22.260 --> 2:12:25.220\n Brave, a fast browser that feels like Chrome\n\n2:12:25.220 --> 2:12:27.860\n but has more privacy preserving features.\n\n2:12:27.860 --> 2:12:30.460\n Athletic Greens, the all in one drink\n\n2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:32.320\n that I start every day with to cover\n\n2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:34.100\n all my nutritional bases.\n\n2:12:34.100 --> 2:12:37.140\n ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years\n\n2:12:37.140 --> 2:12:39.240\n to protect my privacy on the internet.\n\n2:12:39.240 --> 2:12:42.660\n And Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.\n\n2:12:42.660 --> 2:12:45.380\n Please check out the sponsors in the description\n\n2:12:45.380 --> 2:12:48.940\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:51.380\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n2:12:51.380 --> 2:12:53.740\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n2:12:53.740 --> 2:12:56.340\n follow on Spotify, support it on Patreon,\n\n2:12:56.340 --> 2:12:59.620\n or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n2:12:59.620 --> 2:13:01.940\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:13:01.940 --> 2:13:03.800\n from Teddy Roosevelt.\n\n2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:05.880\n It is not the critic who counts.\n\n2:13:06.780 --> 2:13:10.180\n Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles\n\n2:13:10.180 --> 2:13:13.620\n or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.\n\n2:13:13.620 --> 2:13:17.860\n The credit belongs to the man who actually is in the arena,\n\n2:13:17.860 --> 2:13:21.260\n whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood,\n\n2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:24.500\n who strives valiantly, who errs,\n\n2:13:24.500 --> 2:13:27.180\n who comes short again and again,\n\n2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:30.700\n because there is no effort without error and shortcoming,\n\n2:13:30.700 --> 2:13:33.780\n but who does actually strive to do the deeds,\n\n2:13:33.780 --> 2:13:37.460\n who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions,\n\n2:13:37.460 --> 2:13:40.260\n who spends himself in a worthy cause,\n\n2:13:40.260 --> 2:13:43.580\n who at the best knows in the end that triumph\n\n2:13:43.580 --> 2:13:47.380\n of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails,\n\n2:13:47.380 --> 2:13:50.560\n at least fails while daring greatly,\n\n2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:53.220\n so that his place shall never be\n\n2:13:53.220 --> 2:13:55.460\n with those cold and timid souls\n\n2:13:55.460 --> 2:13:58.060\n who neither know victory nor defeat.\n\n2:13:58.060 --> 2:14:10.060\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
