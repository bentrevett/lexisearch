fund,\n\n00:07.580 --> 00:09.960\n very much in the spirit of Wall Street Bets,\n\n00:09.960 --> 00:13.580\n but where the trading is done not directly by humans,\n\n00:13.580 --> 00:15.920\n but by artificial intelligence systems\n\n00:15.920 --> 00:18.260\n submitted by those humans.\n\n00:18.260 --> 00:21.060\n It's a fascinating and extremely difficult\n\n00:21.060 --> 00:22.760\n machine learning competition\n\n00:22.760 --> 00:26.260\n where the incentives of everybody is aligned,\n\n00:26.260 --> 00:29.520\n the code is kept and owned by the people who develop it,\n\n00:29.520 --> 00:33.720\n the data, anonymized data is very well organized\n\n00:33.720 --> 00:35.600\n and made freely available.\n\n00:35.600 --> 00:38.980\n I think this kind of idea has a chance to change\n\n00:38.980 --> 00:40.400\n the nature of stock trading\n\n00:40.400 --> 00:42.600\n and even just money management in general\n\n00:42.600 --> 00:47.440\n by empowering people who are interested in trading stocks\n\n00:47.440 --> 00:50.280\n with the modern and quickly advancing tools\n\n00:50.280 --> 00:51.780\n of machine learning.\n\n00:51.780 --> 00:54.120\n Quick mention of

this podcast.\n\n01:08.640 --> 01:11.240\n As a side note, let me say that this whole set of events\n\n01:11.240 --> 01:14.400\n around GameStop and Wall Street Bets\n\n01:14.400 --> 01:18.720\n has been really inspiring to me as a demonstration\n\n01:18.720 --> 01:20.960\n that a distributed system,\n\n01:20.960 --> 01:24.120\n a large number of regular people\n\n01:24.120 --> 01:26.520\n are able to coordinate and collaborate\n\n01:26.520 --> 01:31.520\n in taking on the elite centralized power structures,\n\n01:32.760 --> 01:35.220\n especially when those elites are misbehaving.\n\n01:36.240 --> 01:39.360\n I believe that power in as many cases as possible\n\n01:39.360 --> 01:40.800\n should be distributed.\n\n01:40.800 --> 01:44.860\n And in this case, the internet, as it is for many cases,\n\n01:44.860 --> 01:48.640\n is the fundamental enabler of that power.\n\n01:48.640 --> 01:50.740\n And at the core, what the internet\n\n01:50.740 --> 01:53.960\n in its distributed nature represents is freedom.\n\n01:53.960 --> 01:55.960\n Of course, the thing about freedom\n\n01:55.960 --> 02:00.960\n is it enables chaos or progress, or sometimes both.\n\n02:02.480 --> 02:04.400\n And that's kind of the point of the thing.\n\n02:04.400 --> 02:09.160\n Freedom is empowering, but ultimately unpredictable.\n\n02:09.160 --> 02:12.520\n And I think in the end, freedom wins.\n\n02:12.520 --> 02:15.560\n If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:15.560 --> 02:18.680\n review it on Apple Podcasts, follow on Spotify,\n\n02:18.680 -->

Crabe.\n\n02:28.080 --> 02:29.880\n From your perspective, can you summarize\n\n02:29.880 --> 02:32.720\n the important events around this amazing saga\n\n02:32.720 --> 02:34.960\n that we've been living through of Wall Street Bets,\n\n02:34.960 --> 02:38.160\n the subreddit and GameStop, and in general,\n\n02:38.160 --> 02:39.720\n just what are your thoughts about it\n\n02:39.720 --> 02:42.120\n from a technical to the philosophical level?\n\n02:42.120 --> 02:42.960\n I think it's amazing.\n\n02:42.960 --> 02:44.940\n It's like my favorite story ever.\n\n02:46.500 --> 02:47.760\n Like when I was reading about it,\n\n02:47.760 --> 02:49.380\n I was like, this is the best.\n\n02:49.380 --> 02:53.780\n And it's also connected with my company,\n\n02:53.780 --> 02:54.740\n which we can talk about.\n\n02:54.740 --> 02:57.020\n But what I liked about it is like,\n\n02:57.020 --> 02:59.420\n I like decentralized coordination\n\n02:59.420 --> 03:01.500\n and looking at the mechanisms\n\n03:01.500 --> 03:04.860\n that these are Wall Street Bets users use\n\n03:04.860 --> 03:08.180\n to hype each other up, to get excited,\n\n03:08.180 --> 03:11.080\n to prove that they bought the stock and they're holding.\n\n03:12.100 --> 03:15.940\n And then also to see that how big of an impact\n\n03:15.940 --> 03:18.000\n that that decentralized coordination had.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.240\n So it really was a big deal.\n\n03:21.240 --> 03:24.420\n Were you impressed by the distributed coordination,\n\n03:24.420 --> 03:26.400\n the collaboration amongst like,\n\n03:26.400 --> 03:27.480\n I don't know what the numbers are.\n\n03:27.480 --> 03:30.480\n I know I'm numerized looking at the data.\n\n03:30.480 --> 03:32.640\n After all of this is over and done,\n\n03:32.640 --> 03:34.440\n it'd be interesting to see like\n\n03:34.440 --> 03:38.200\n from a large scale distributed system perspective\n\n03:38.200 --> 03:40.340\n to see how everything played out.\n\n03:40.340 --> 03:44.160\n But just from your current perspective, what we know,\n\n03:44.160 --> 03:47.640\n is it obvious to you that such incredible level\n\n03:47.640 --> 03:49.920\n of coordination could happen\n\n03:49.920 --> 03:52.780\n where a lot of people come together in a distributed sense,\n\n03:52.780 --> 03:54.960\n there's an emergent behavior that happens after that.\n\n03:54.960 --> 03:57.400\n No, it's not at all obvious.\n\n03:57.400 --> 04:01.760\n And one of the reasons is the lack of credibility.\n\n04:01.760 --> 04:02.740\n To coordinate with someone,\n\n04:02.740 --> 04:06.600\n you need to make credible contracts or credible claims.\n\n04:06.600 --> 04:11.600\n So if you have a username on our Wall Street Bets,\n\n04:11.620 --> 04:14.700\n like some of them are, like deep fucking value\n\n04:14.700 --> 04:15.540\n is one of them.\n\n04:15.540 --> 04:16.580\n That's an actual username.\n\n04:16.580 --> 04:18.240\n By the way, we're talking about,\n\n04:18.240 --> 04:19.600\n there's a website called Reddit\n\n04:19.600 --> 04:21.120\n and there's subreddits on it.\n\n04:21.120 --> 04:24.120\n And a lot of people, mostly anonymous,\n\n04:24.120 --> 04:27.080\n I think for the most part anonymous,\n\n04:27.080 --> 04:28.260\n can create user accounts\n\n04:28.260 --> 04:31.240\n and then can then just talk on forum like style boards.\n\n04:31.240 --> 04:32.340\n You should know what Reddit is.\n\n04:32.340 --> 04:34.920\n If you don't know what Reddit is, check it out.\n\n04:34.920 --> 04:36.040\n If you don't know what Reddit is,\n\n04:36.040 --> 04:40.560\n maybe go to the awesome subreddit first,\n\n04:40.560 --> 04:43.120\n aww with cute pictures of cats and dogs.\n\n04:43.120 --> 04:44.080\n That's my recommendation.\n\n04:44.080 --> 04:44.920\n Anyway.\n\n04:44.920 --> 04:46.140\n Okay, yeah, that would be a good start to Reddit.\n\n04:46.140 --> 04:48.960\n When you get into it more, go to our Wall Street Bets.\n\n04:48.960 --> 04:50.960\n It gets dark quickly.\n\n04:50.960 --> 04:53.060\n We'll probably talk about that too.\n\n04:53.060 --> 04:56.240\n So yeah, so there's these users\n\n04:56.240 --> 04:58.200\n and there's no contracts, like you were saying.\n\n04:58.200 --> 05:01.480\n There's no contracts, the users are anonymous,\n\n05:01.480 --> 05:03.560\n but there are little things that do help.\n\n05:03.560 --> 05:04.480\n So for example,\n\n05:04.480 --> 05:07.720\n if you've posted a really good investment idea in the past,\n\n05:07.720 --> 05:10.040\n that exists on Reddit as well.\n\n05:10.040 --> 05:12.640\n And it might have lots of upvotes.\n\n05:12.640 --> 05:14.840\n And that's also kind of like giving credibility\n\n05:14.840 --> 05:17.000\n to your next thing.\n\n05:17.880 --> 05:20.820\n And then they are also putting up screenshots,\n\n05:20.820 --> 05:25.820\n like here's the trades I've made and here's a screenshot.\n\n05:26.160 --> 05:28.160\n Now you could fake the screenshot,\n\n05:28.160 --> 05:32.200\n but still it seems like if you've got a lot of karma\n\n05:32.200 --> 05:35.280\n and you've had a good performance on the community,\n\n05:35.280 --> 05:37.680\n it somehow becomes credible enough\n\n05:37.680 --> 05:39.760\n for other people to be like, you know what?\n\n05:39.760 --> 05:43.240\n He actually probably did put a million dollars into this.\n\n05:43.240 --> 05:46.360\n And you know what, I can follow that trade easily.\n\n05:46.360 --> 05:47.680\n And there's a bunch of people like that.\n\n05:47.680 --> 05:50.260\n So you're kind of integrating all that information\n\n05:50.260 --> 05:52.600\n together yourself to see like, huh,\n\n05:52.600 --> 05:53.520\n there's something happening here.\n\n05:53.520 --> 05:57.440\n And then you jump onto this little boat of like behavior,\n\n05:57.440 --> 06:00.400\n like we should buy the stock or sell the stock.\n\n06:00.400 --> 06:02.440\n And then another person jumps on,\n\n06:02.440 --> 06:04.520\n another person jumps on.\n\n06:04.520 --> 06:07.280\n And all of a sudden you have just a huge number of people\n\n06:07.280 --> 06:08.640\n behaving in the same direction.\n\n06:08.640 --> 06:10.640\n It's like flock of whatever birds.\n\n06:10.640 --> 06:11.480\n Exactly.\n\n06:11.480 --> 06:12.480\n What was strange with this one,\n\n06:12.480 --> 06:15.320\n it wasn't just let's all buy Tesla.\n\n06:15.320 --> 06:18.800\n We love Elon, we love Tesla, let's all buy Tesla.\n\n06:18.800 --> 06:21.040\n Because that we've heard before, right?\n\n06:21.040 --> 06:23.960\n Everybody likes Tesla.\n\n06:23.960 --> 06:25.060\n Well, now they do.\n\n06:26.200 --> 06:29.560\n So what they did with this in this case,\n\n06:29.560 --> 06:31.360\n they're buying a stock that was bad.\n\n06:31.360 --> 06:33.440\n They're buying it because it was bad.\n\n06:33.440 --> 06:36.240\n And that's really weird because that's a little bit\n\n06:37.240 --> 06:41.340\n too galaxy brain for a decentralized community.\n\n06:41.340 --> 06:43.220\n How did they come up with it?\n\n06:43.220 --> 06:44.820\n How did they know that was the right one?\n\n06:44.820 --> 06:46.580\n And the reason they liked it\n\n06:46.580 --> 06:49.860\n is because it had really, really high short interest.\n\n06:49.860 --> 06:54.780\n It had been shorted more than its own float, I believe.\n\n06:54.780 --> 06:57.500\n And so they figured out that if they all bought\n\n06:57.500 --> 07:02.500\n this bad stock, they could short squeeze some hedge funds.\n\n07:03.260 --> 07:05.220\n And those hedge funds would have to capitulate\n\n07:05.220 --> 07:08.380\n and buy the stock at really, really high prices.\n\n07:08.380 --> 07:10.540\n And we should say that shorted means that\n\n07:10.540 --> 07:13.180\n these are a bunch of people, when you short a stock,\n\n07:13.180 --> 07:16.140\n you're betting on the, you're predicting\n\n07:16.140 --> 07:17.500\n that the stock's going to go down\n\n07:17.500 --> 07:19.580\n and then you will make money if it does.\n\n07:19.580 --> 07:22.340\n And then what's a short squeeze?\n\n07:22.340 --> 07:24.580\n It's really that if you are a hedge fund\n\n07:24.580 --> 07:27.920\n and you take a big short position in a company,\n\n07:28.920 --> 07:31.100\n there's a certain level at which\n\n07:31.100 --> 07:34.780\n you can't sustain holding that position.\n\n07:34.780 --> 07:37.320\n There's no limit to how high a stock can go,\n\n07:37.320 --> 07:39.700\n but there is a limit to how low it can go, right?\n\n07:39.700 --> 07:43.180\n So if you short something, you have infinite loss potential.\n\n07:43.180 --> 07:47.060\n And if the stock doubles overnight, like GameStop did,\n\n07:48.580 --> 07:51.900\n you're putting a lot of stress on that hedge fund.\n\n07:51.900 --> 07:53.780\n And that hedge fund manager might have to say,\n\n07:53.780 --> 07:56.340\n you know what, I have to get out of the trade.\n\n07:56.340 --> 07:59.580\n And the only way to get out is to buy the bad stock\n\n07:59.580 --> 08:02.580\n that they don't want, like they believe will go down.\n\n08:02.580 --> 08:05.380\n So it's an interesting situation,\n\n08:05.380 --> 08:09.140\n particularly because it's not zero sum.\n\n08:09.140 --> 08:11.460\n If you say, let's all get together\n\n08:11.460 --> 08:13.620\n and make a bubble in watermelons,\n\n08:13.620 --> 08:14.860\n you buy a bunch of watermelons,\n\n08:14.860 --> 08:17.240\n the price goes up, it comes down again,\n\n08:18.260 --> 08:20.860\n it's a zero sum game.\n\n08:20.860 --> 08:22.460\n If someone's already shorted a stock\n\n08:22.460 --> 08:24.040\n and you can make them short squeeze,\n\n08:24.040 --> 08:25.900\n it's actually a positive sum game.\n\n08:25.900 --> 08:28.160\n So yes, some Redditors will make a lot of money,\n\n08:28.160 --> 08:29.740\n some will lose a lot,\n\n08:29.740 --> 08:32.500\n but actually the whole group will make money.\n\n08:32.500 --> 08:36.980\n And that's really why it was such a clever thing\n\n08:36.980 --> 08:38.140\n for them to do.\n\n08:38.140 --> 08:40.660\n And coupled to the fact that shorting,\n\n08:40.660 --> 08:42.740\n I mean, maybe you can push back,\n\n08:42.740 --> 08:45.840\n but to me always from an outsider's perspective,\n\n08:45.840 --> 08:48.860\n seemed, I hope I'm not using too strong of a word,\n\n08:48.860 --> 08:51.180\n but it seemed almost unethical.\n\n08:51.180 --> 08:54.600\n Maybe not unethical, maybe it's just a asshole thing to do.\n\n08:55.620 --> 08:57.760\n Okay, I'm speaking not from an economics\n\n08:57.760 --> 08:58.780\n or financial perspective,\n\n08:58.780 --> 09:02.360\n I'm speaking from just somebody who loves,\n\n09:02.360 --> 09:03.540\n I'm a fan of a lot of people,\n\n09:03.540 --> 09:07.000\n I love celebrating the success of a lot of people.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:12.000\n And this is like the stock market equivalent of like haters.\n\n09:13.060 --> 09:14.420\n I know that's not what it is.\n\n09:14.420 --> 09:15.740\n I know that there's efficient,\n\n09:15.740 --> 09:18.240\n you wanna have an economy efficient mechanism\n\n09:18.240 --> 09:23.240\n for punishing sort of overhyped, overvalued things.\n\n09:23.860 --> 09:26.100\n That's what shorthand guess is designed for.\n\n09:26.100 --> 09:29.540\n But it just always felt like these people are just,\n\n09:29.540 --> 09:33.500\n because they're not just betting on the loss of the company.\n\n09:33.500 --> 09:37.340\n It feels like they're also using their leverage and power\n\n09:37.340 --> 09:40.780\n to manipulate media or just to write articles\n\n09:40.780 --> 09:43.440\n or just to hate on you on social media.\n\n09:43.440 --> 09:46.500\n Then you get to see that with Elon Musk and so on.\n\n09:46.500 --> 09:50.560\n So this is like the man,\n\n09:50.560 --> 09:53.780\n so people like hedge funds that were shorting\n\n09:53.780 --> 09:58.740\n are like the sort of embodiment of the evil\n\n09:58.740 --> 10:01.320\n or just the bad guy, the overpowerful\n\n10:01.320 --> 10:02.860\n that's misusing their power.\n\n10:02.860 --> 10:04.140\n And here's the crowd,\n\n10:04.140 --> 10:06.380\n the people that are standing up and rising up.\n\n10:06.380 --> 10:10.500\n So it's not just that they were able to collaborate\n\n10:10.500 --> 10:13.340\n on Wall Street bets to sort of effectively\n\n10:13.340 --> 10:14.820\n make money for themselves.\n\n10:14.820 --> 10:17.380\n It's also that this is like a symbol\n\n10:17.380 --> 10:19.420\n of the people getting together\n\n10:19.420 --> 10:23.380\n and fighting the centralized elites, the powerful.\n\n10:23.380 --> 10:27.140\n And that, I don't know what your thoughts are\n\n10:27.140 --> 10:28.580\n about that in general.\n\n10:28.580 --> 10:32.140\n At this stage, it feels like that's really exciting\n\n10:32.140 --> 10:35.340\n that people have power,\n\n10:35.340 --> 10:38.200\n just like regular people have power.\n\n10:38.200 --> 10:40.780\n At the same time, it's scary a little bit\n\n10:40.780 --> 10:44.320\n because just studying history,\n\n10:44.320 --> 10:48.040\n people could be manipulated by charismatic leaders.\n\n10:49.340 --> 10:54.220\n And so just like Elon right now is manipulating,\n\n10:54.220 --> 10:56.720\n encouraging people to buy Dogecoin or whatever,\n\n10:58.820 --> 11:00.780\n there can be good charismatic leaders\n\n11:00.780 --> 11:02.540\n and there can be bad charismatic leaders.\n\n11:02.540 --> 11:04.580\n And so it's nerve wracking.\n\n11:04.580 --> 11:06.860\n It's a little bit scary how much power\n\n11:06.860 --> 11:11.220\n a subreddit can have to destroy somebody\n\n11:11.220 --> 11:12.980\n because right now we're celebrating\n\n11:12.980 --> 11:15.020\n they might be attacking or destroying somebody\n\n11:15.020 --> 11:17.140\n that everybody doesn't like,\n\n11:17.140 --> 11:19.140\n but what if they attack somebody\n\n11:19.140 --> 11:21.060\n that is actually good for this world?\n\n11:21.060 --> 11:25.940\n So that, and that's kind of the awesomeness\n\n11:25.940 --> 11:28.540\n and the price of freedom.\n\n11:28.540 --> 11:31.200\n It's like it could destroy the world\n\n11:31.200 --> 11:32.640\n or it can save the world.\n\n11:32.640 --> 11:35.220\n But at this stage, it feels like, I don't know,\n\n11:35.220 --> 11:36.700\n overall, when you sit back,\n\n11:36.700 --> 11:39.620\n do you think this was just a positive wave\n\n11:39.620 --> 11:41.060\n of emergent behavior?\n\n11:41.060 --> 11:43.280\n Is there something negative about what happened?\n\n11:43.280 --> 11:47.020\n Well, yeah, the cool thing is they weren't doing anything,\n\n11:47.020 --> 11:50.720\n the Reddit people weren't doing anything exotic.\n\n11:50.720 --> 11:55.140\n It was a creative trade, but it wasn't exotic.\n\n11:55.140 --> 11:57.700\n It wasn't, it was just buying the stock.\n\n11:57.700 --> 12:00.300\n Okay, maybe they bought some options too,\n\n12:00.300 --> 12:03.920\n but it was the hedge fund that was doing the exotic thing.\n\n12:04.780 --> 12:06.380\n So I liked that.\n\n12:06.380 --> 12:10.580\n It was, it's hard to say, well, we've got together\n\n12:10.580 --> 12:12.980\n and we've pulled all our money together\n\n12:12.980 --> 12:16.480\n and now there's a company out there that's worth more.\n\n12:16.480 --> 12:17.620\n What's wrong with that?\n\n12:17.620 --> 12:18.580\n Yeah. Right?\n\n12:18.580 --> 12:21.820\n But it doesn't talk about the motivations, which is,\n\n12:21.820 --> 12:25.020\n and then we destroyed some hedge funds in the process.\n\n12:25.020 --> 12:28.180\n Is there something to be said about the humor\n\n12:28.180 --> 12:31.780\n and the, I don't know, the edginess,\n\n12:31.780 --> 12:34.220\n sometimes viciousness of that subreddit?\n\n12:34.220 --> 12:36.420\n I haven't looked at it too much,\n\n12:36.420 --> 12:40.900\n but it feels like people can be quite aggressive on there.\n\n12:40.900 --> 12:45.180\n So is there, what is that?\n\n12:45.180 --> 12:48.120\n Is that what Freedom looks like?\n\n12:49.020 --> 12:50.080\n I think it does, yeah.\n\n12:50.080 --> 12:52.380\n You definitely need to let people,\n\n12:52.380 --> 12:54.740\n one of the things that people have compared it to\n\n12:54.740 --> 12:58.180\n is the Occupy Wall Street, which is, let's say,\n\n12:58.180 --> 13:03.180\n some very sincere liberals, like 23 years old, whatever,\n\n13:03.540 --> 13:04.980\n and they go out with signs\n\n13:04.980 --> 13:07.400\n and they have some kind of case to make.\n\n13:08.540 --> 13:11.740\n But this isn't sincere, really.\n\n13:11.740 --> 13:14.700\n It's like a little bit more nihilistic,\n\n13:14.700 --> 13:18.020\n a little bit more YOLO, and therefore a little bit\n\n13:18.020 --> 13:22.500\n more scary because who's scared of the Occupy Wall Street\n\n13:22.500 --> 13:23.660\n people with the signs?\n\n13:23.660 --> 13:24.500\n Nobody.\n\n13:24.500 --> 13:26.020\n But these hedge funds really are scared.\n\n13:26.020 --> 13:29.820\n I was scared of the Wall Street bats people.\n\n13:29.820 --> 13:31.900\n I'm still scared of them.\n\n13:31.900 --> 13:36.900\n Yeah, the anonymity is a bit terrifying and exciting.\n\n13:36.900 --> 13:37.860\n Yeah.\n\n13:37.860 --> 13:40.500\n I mean, yeah, I don't know what to do with this.\n\n13:40.500 --> 13:43.500\n I've been following events in Russia, for example.\n\n13:43.500 --> 13:46.140\n It's like there's a struggle between centralized power\n\n13:46.140 --> 13:47.460\n and the distributed.\n\n13:47.460 --> 13:50.260\n I mean, that's the struggle of the history\n\n13:50.260 --> 13:51.740\n of human civilization, right?\n\n13:51.740 --> 13:56.740\n But this on the internet, just that you can multiply people.\n\n13:57.700 --> 13:59.700\n Like some of them don't have to be real.\n\n13:59.700 --> 14:01.460\n Like you can probably create bots.\n\n14:01.460 --> 14:05.500\n Like it starts getting me, me as a programmer,\n\n14:05.500 --> 14:08.780\n I start to think like, hmm, me as one person,\n\n14:08.780 --> 14:12.260\n how much chaos can I create by writing some bots?\n\n14:12.260 --> 14:13.380\n Yeah.\n\n14:13.380 --> 14:17.700\n And I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking that.\n\n14:17.700 --> 14:19.820\n There's, I'm sure there's hundreds, thousands\n\n14:19.820 --> 14:22.420\n of good developers out there listening to this,\n\n14:22.420 --> 14:23.860\n thinking the same thing.\n\n14:23.860 --> 14:26.540\n And then as that develops further and further\n\n14:26.540 --> 14:28.300\n in the next like decade or two,\n\n14:28.300 --> 14:30.580\n what impact does that have on financial markets,\n\n14:30.580 --> 14:35.580\n on just destruction of reputations of just,\n\n14:37.140 --> 14:41.500\n or politics, the bickering of left and right\n\n14:41.500 --> 14:44.020\n political discourse, the dynamics of that\n\n14:44.020 --> 14:46.860\n being manipulated by, you know,\n\n14:46.860 --> 14:49.580\n people talk about like Russian bots or whatever.\n\n14:49.580 --> 14:52.660\n We're probably in a very early stage of that, right?\n\n14:52.660 --> 14:53.980\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n14:53.980 --> 14:56.580\n And this is a good example.\n\n14:56.580 --> 15:00.540\n So do you have a sense that most of WallStreetBets folks\n\n15:00.540 --> 15:02.780\n are actually individual people, right?\n\n15:02.780 --> 15:05.340\n That's the feeling I have is they're just individual,\n\n15:05.340 --> 15:07.900\n maybe young investors, just doing a little bit\n\n15:07.900 --> 15:10.140\n of an investment, but just on a large scale.\n\n15:10.140 --> 15:11.180\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n15:11.180 --> 15:13.780\n The reason I found out, I've known about WallStreetBets\n\n15:13.780 --> 15:15.500\n for a while, but the reason I found out about GameStop\n\n15:15.500 --> 15:17.860\n was this, just I met somebody at a party\n\n15:17.860 --> 15:20.300\n who told me about it and he was like 21 years old\n\n15:20.300 --> 15:23.860\n and he's like, it's gonna go up 100% in the next one day.\n\n15:23.860 --> 15:26.020\n That we're talking about in last year?\n\n15:26.020 --> 15:29.220\n This was probably, no, this was, yeah, a few days ago.\n\n15:29.220 --> 15:33.300\n Yeah, it was like maybe two weeks ago or something.\n\n15:34.260 --> 15:37.420\n So it was already high GameStop,\n\n15:37.420 --> 15:39.300\n but it was just strange to me that there was someone\n\n15:39.300 --> 15:42.740\n telling me at a party how to trade stocks\n\n15:42.740 --> 15:44.340\n who was like 21 years old.\n\n15:44.340 --> 15:49.100\n And I started to, yeah, I started to look into it.\n\n15:49.100 --> 15:52.100\n And yeah, and he did make, he made it, yeah,\n\n15:52.100 --> 15:55.500\n he made 140% in one day, he was right.\n\n15:55.500 --> 15:58.980\n And now he's supercharged, he's a little bit wealthier\n\n15:58.980 --> 16:01.180\n and now he's gonna wait for the next thing.\n\n16:01.180 --> 16:03.100\n And this decentralized entity\n\n16:03.100 --> 16:04.580\n is just gonna get bigger and bigger.\n\n16:04.580 --> 16:06.580\n And they're gonna together search for the next thing.\n\n16:06.580 --> 16:08.820\n So there's thousands of folks like him\n\n16:08.820 --> 16:10.020\n and they're going to probably search\n\n16:10.020 --> 16:11.580\n for the next thing to attack.\n\n16:11.580 --> 16:14.460\n People that have power in this world that sit there\n\n16:14.460 --> 16:18.180\n with power right now in government and in finance\n\n16:18.180 --> 16:20.260\n and any kind of position\n\n16:20.260 --> 16:22.940\n are probably a little bit scared right now.\n\n16:22.940 --> 16:26.260\n And honestly, that's probably a little bit good.\n\n16:26.260 --> 16:28.100\n It's dangerous, but it's good.\n\n16:28.100 --> 16:31.420\n Yeah, it certainly makes you think twice about shorting.\n\n16:31.420 --> 16:32.740\n It certainly makes you think twice\n\n16:32.740 --> 16:35.020\n about putting a lot of money into a short.\n\n16:35.020 --> 16:38.620\n Like these funds put a lot into one or two names.\n\n16:38.620 --> 16:41.700\n And so it was very, very badly risk managed.\n\n16:41.700 --> 16:46.020\n Do you think shorting is, can you speak at a high level\n\n16:46.020 --> 16:50.060\n just for your own as a person, is it good for the world?\n\n16:50.060 --> 16:52.140\n Is it good for markets?\n\n16:52.140 --> 16:55.180\n I do think that the two kinds of shorting,\n\n16:55.180 --> 16:59.460\n evil shorting and chill shorting.\n\n17:00.860 --> 17:04.500\n Evil shorting is what Melvin Capital was doing.\n\n17:04.500 --> 17:08.780\n And it's like, you put a huge position down,\n\n17:08.780 --> 17:10.780\n you get all your buddies to also short it\n\n17:10.780 --> 17:12.420\n and you start making press\n\n17:12.420 --> 17:16.660\n and trying to bring this company down.\n\n17:16.660 --> 17:19.340\n And I don't think in some cases,\n\n17:20.420 --> 17:22.380\n you go out after like fraudulent companies say,\n\n17:22.380 --> 17:24.100\n this company is a fraud.\n\n17:24.100 --> 17:24.940\n Maybe that's okay.\n\n17:24.940 --> 17:27.020\n Like some, but they weren't even saying,\n\n17:27.020 --> 17:29.140\n they're just saying it's a bad company\n\n17:29.140 --> 17:30.940\n and we're going to bring it to the ground,\n\n17:30.940 --> 17:32.020\n bring it to its knees.\n\n17:32.020 --> 17:37.020\n So a quant fund like Numerai,\n\n17:37.100 --> 17:39.100\n we always have lots of positions\n\n17:39.100 --> 17:40.260\n and we never have a position\n\n17:40.260 --> 17:43.420\n that's like more than 1% of our fund.\n\n17:43.420 --> 17:48.260\n So we actually have right now, 250 shorts.\n\n17:48.260 --> 17:52.060\n I don't know any of them except for one\n\n17:52.060 --> 17:53.940\n because it was one of the meme stocks.\n\n17:53.940 --> 17:58.940\n But we shorting them not to make them go,\n\n17:58.940 --> 18:01.460\n we don't even want them to go down necessarily.\n\n18:01.460 --> 18:03.180\n That doesn't sound a bit strange that I say that,\n\n18:03.180 --> 18:08.180\n but we just want them to not go up as much as our longs.\n\n18:09.420 --> 18:13.420\n So by shorting a little bit,\n\n18:13.420 --> 18:15.060\n we can actually go long more\n\n18:15.060 --> 18:16.780\n in the things we do believe in.\n\n18:16.780 --> 18:19.500\n So when we were going long in Tesla,\n\n18:19.500 --> 18:22.020\n we could do it with more money than we had\n\n18:22.020 --> 18:24.860\n because we would borrow from banks\n\n18:24.860 --> 18:27.380\n who would lend us money to go down.\n\n18:27.380 --> 18:32.220\n Who would lend us money because we had longs and shorts,\n\n18:32.220 --> 18:34.660\n because we didn't have market exposure,\n\n18:34.660 --> 18:35.780\n we didn't have market risk.\n\n18:35.780 --> 18:37.380\n And so I think that's a good thing\n\n18:37.380 --> 18:41.060\n because that means we can short the oil companies\n\n18:41.060 --> 18:44.180\n and go long Tesla and make the future come forward faster.\n\n18:44.180 --> 18:46.180\n And I do think that's not a bad thing.\n\n18:47.180 --> 18:51.060\n So we've talked about this incredible distributed system\n\n18:51.060 --> 18:52.580\n created by Wall Street Bets.\n\n18:52.580 --> 18:56.940\n And then there's a platform which is Robinhood,\n\n18:56.940 --> 18:59.340\n which allows investors to efficiently as far,\n\n18:59.340 --> 19:00.500\n you can correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n19:00.500 --> 19:04.220\n but there's those and there's others in this new MRI\n\n19:04.220 --> 19:09.220\n that allow you to make it accessible for people to invest.\n\n19:09.580 --> 19:14.580\n But that said, Robinhood was in a centralized way\n\n19:15.700 --> 19:17.740\n applied its power to restrict trading\n\n19:17.740 --> 19:19.900\n on the stocks that we're referring to.\n\n19:19.900 --> 19:21.860\n Do you have a thoughts on actually\n\n19:21.860 --> 19:23.940\n like the things that happened?\n\n19:23.940 --> 19:26.580\n I don't know how much you were paying attention\n\n19:26.580 --> 19:30.420\n to sort of the shadiness around the whole thing.\n\n19:30.420 --> 19:32.540\n Do you think it was forced to do it?\n\n19:32.540 --> 19:34.420\n Or was there something shady going on?\n\n19:34.420 --> 19:36.060\n What are your thoughts in general?\n\n19:36.060 --> 19:39.860\n Well, I think I wanna see the alternate history.\n\n19:39.860 --> 19:43.020\n Like I wanna see the counterfactual history\n\n19:43.020 --> 19:44.740\n of them not doing that.\n\n19:44.740 --> 19:47.980\n How bad would it have gotten for hedge funds?\n\n19:47.980 --> 19:50.220\n How much more damage could have been done\n\n19:50.220 --> 19:53.400\n if the momentum of these short squeezes could continue?\n\n19:53.400 --> 19:57.240\n What happens when there are short squeezes,\n\n19:57.240 --> 20:00.520\n even if they're in a few stocks,\n\n20:00.520 --> 20:02.920\n they affect kind of all the other shorts too.\n\n20:02.920 --> 20:05.680\n And suddenly brokers are saying things like,\n\n20:05.680 --> 20:07.400\n you need to put up more collateral.\n\n20:07.400 --> 20:12.080\n So we had a short, it wasn't GameStop luckily,\n\n20:12.080 --> 20:15.440\n it was Blackberry and it went up like 100% in a day.\n\n20:15.440 --> 20:17.640\n It was one of these meme stocks, super bad company.\n\n20:17.640 --> 20:19.720\n The AIs don't like it, okay?\n\n20:19.720 --> 20:21.240\n The AIs think it's going down.\n\n20:21.240 --> 20:22.400\n What's a meme stock?\n\n20:22.400 --> 20:26.360\n A meme stock is kind of a new term for these stocks\n\n20:26.360 --> 20:30.360\n that catch memetic momentum on Reddit.\n\n20:32.080 --> 20:36.080\n And so the meme stocks were GameStop, the biggest one,\n\n20:36.080 --> 20:39.440\n GameStonk, as Elon calls it, AMC.\n\n20:39.440 --> 20:44.440\n And Blackberry was one, Nokia was one.\n\n20:44.880 --> 20:47.960\n So these are high short interest stocks as well.\n\n20:47.960 --> 20:50.040\n So these are targeted stocks.\n\n20:50.040 --> 20:53.360\n Some people say, oh, isn't it adorable\n\n20:53.360 --> 20:56.280\n that these people are investing money\n\n20:56.280 --> 20:59.440\n in these companies that are nostalgic?\n\n20:59.440 --> 21:01.640\n It's like, you go into the AMC movie theater,\n\n21:01.640 --> 21:02.480\n it's like nostalgic.\n\n21:02.480 --> 21:05.040\n It's like, no, it's not why they're doing it.\n\n21:05.040 --> 21:07.000\n It's that they had a lot of short interest.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.320\n That was the main thing.\n\n21:08.320 --> 21:11.520\n And so there were high chance of short squeeze.\n\n21:11.520 --> 21:14.040\n In saying, I would love to see an alternate history,\n\n21:14.040 --> 21:16.080\n do you have a sense that that,\n\n21:17.080 --> 21:19.840\n what is your prediction of what that history would look like?\n\n21:19.840 --> 21:23.040\n Well, you wouldn't have needed very many more days\n\n21:23.040 --> 21:27.560\n of that kind of chaos to hurt hedge funds.\n\n21:28.440 --> 21:31.880\n I think it's underrated how damaging it could have been.\n\n21:32.840 --> 21:37.360\n Because when your shorts go up,\n\n21:38.440 --> 21:40.520\n your collateral requirements for them go up.\n\n21:40.520 --> 21:41.880\n It's similar to Robinhood.\n\n21:41.880 --> 21:46.080\n Like we have a prime broker that says, said to us,\n\n21:46.080 --> 21:51.080\n you need to put up like $40 per $100 of short exposure.\n\n21:51.480 --> 21:52.560\n And then the next day they said,\n\n21:52.560 --> 21:56.480\n actually you have to put up all of it, 100%.\n\n21:56.480 --> 21:57.600\n And we were like, what?\n\n21:58.960 --> 22:02.440\n But if that happens to all the short,\n\n22:02.440 --> 22:05.560\n all the commonly held hedge fund shorts,\n\n22:05.560 --> 22:08.320\n because they're all kind of holding the same things.\n\n22:08.320 --> 22:13.320\n If that happens, not only do you have to cover the short,\n\n22:13.320 --> 22:16.160\n which means you're buying the bad companies,\n\n22:16.160 --> 22:18.720\n you need to sell your good companies\n\n22:18.720 --> 22:20.880\n in order to cover the short.\n\n22:20.880 --> 22:23.640\n So suddenly like all the good companies,\n\n22:23.640 --> 22:26.200\n all the ones that the hedge funds like are coming down\n\n22:26.200 --> 22:29.920\n and all the ones that the hedge funds hate are going up\n\n22:29.920 --> 22:33.920\n in a cascading way.\n\n22:33.920 --> 22:37.120\n So I believe that if you could have had a few more days\n\n22:37.120 --> 22:40.840\n of GameStop doubling, AMC doubling,\n\n22:40.840 --> 22:45.480\n you would have had more and more hedge fund deleveraging.\n\n22:45.480 --> 22:48.360\n But so hedge funds, I mean, they get a lot of shit,\n\n22:48.360 --> 22:51.320\n but they, do you have a sense\n\n22:51.320 --> 22:53.480\n that they do some good for the world?\n\n22:53.480 --> 22:55.320\n I mean, ultimately, so, okay.\n\n22:55.320 --> 22:57.040\n First of all, Wall Street bets itself\n\n22:57.040 --> 22:59.320\n is a kind of distributed hedge fund.\n\n22:59.320 --> 23:01.520\n Numeri is a kind of hedge fund.\n\n23:01.520 --> 23:04.000\n So I got, hedge fund is a very broad category.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.200\n I mean, like if some of those were destroyed,\n\n23:07.200 --> 23:08.880\n would that be good for the world?\n\n23:08.880 --> 23:11.960\n Or would there be coupled\n\n23:11.960 --> 23:15.160\n with the destroying the evil shorting,\n\n23:15.160 --> 23:16.640\n would there be just a lot of pain\n\n23:16.640 --> 23:18.960\n in terms of investment in good companies?\n\n23:18.960 --> 23:21.360\n Yeah, a thing I like to tell people\n\n23:21.360 --> 23:23.680\n if they hate hedge funds is,\n\n23:23.680 --> 23:27.960\n I don't think you want to rerun American economic history\n\n23:27.960 --> 23:29.680\n without hedge funds.\n\n23:29.680 --> 23:34.000\n So on mass they're, yeah, they're good.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.040\n Yeah, you really wouldn't want to.\n\n23:36.040 --> 23:38.640\n Because hedge funds are kind of like picking up,\n\n23:38.640 --> 23:41.200\n they're making liquidity, right, in stocks.\n\n23:41.200 --> 23:45.520\n And so if you love venture capitalists,\n\n23:45.520 --> 23:48.320\n they're investing in new technology, it's so good.\n\n23:48.320 --> 23:50.560\n You have to also kind of like hedge funds\n\n23:50.560 --> 23:54.040\n because they're the reason venture capitalists exist\n\n23:54.040 --> 23:56.520\n because their companies can have a liquidity event\n\n23:56.520 --> 23:58.960\n when they go to the public markets.\n\n23:58.960 --> 24:01.960\n So it's kind of essential that we have them.\n\n24:01.960 --> 24:04.440\n There are many different kinds of them.\n\n24:04.440 --> 24:06.240\n I believe we could maybe get away\n\n24:06.240 --> 24:09.600\n with only having an AI hedge fund.\n\n24:11.560 --> 24:13.120\n But we don't necessarily need\n\n24:13.120 --> 24:15.280\n these evil billions type hedge funds\n\n24:15.280 --> 24:18.600\n that make the media and try to kill companies.\n\n24:18.600 --> 24:20.160\n But we definitely need hedge funds.\n\n24:20.160 --> 24:21.760\n Maybe from your perspective,\n\n24:21.760 --> 24:26.760\n because you run such an organization\n\n24:27.360 --> 24:30.760\n and Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood,\n\n24:30.760 --> 24:32.720\n sort of had to make decisions really quickly,\n\n24:32.720 --> 24:33.680\n probably had to wake up\n\n24:33.680 --> 24:36.920\n in the middle of the night kind of thing.\n\n24:36.920 --> 24:40.680\n And he also had a conversation with Elon Musk on Clubhouse,\n\n24:40.680 --> 24:42.360\n which I just signed up for.\n\n24:42.360 --> 24:43.560\n It was a fascinating,\n\n24:43.560 --> 24:47.480\n one of the great journalistic performances of our time\n\n24:47.480 --> 24:49.080\n with Elon Musk.\n\n24:49.080 --> 24:51.080\n Pull a surprise for Elon.\n\n24:51.080 --> 24:53.880\n How hilarious would it be if he gets a pull a surprise?\n\n24:55.880 --> 24:58.240\n And then his Wikipedia would be like journalist\n\n24:58.240 --> 25:00.360\n and part time entrepreneur.\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:01.200\n Business magnate.\n\n25:01.200 --> 25:02.840\n Business magnate.\n\n25:02.840 --> 25:05.520\n As you know, I don't know if you can comment\n\n25:05.520 --> 25:06.720\n on any aspects of that,\n\n25:06.720 --> 25:08.600\n but like, if you were Vlad,\n\n25:08.600 --> 25:10.080\n how would you do things differently?\n\n25:10.080 --> 25:13.320\n What are your thoughts about his interaction with Elon?\n\n25:13.320 --> 25:15.640\n How he should have played it differently?\n\n25:15.640 --> 25:19.400\n Like, I guess there's a lot of aspects to this interaction.\n\n25:19.400 --> 25:20.920\n One is about transparency.\n\n25:20.920 --> 25:23.240\n Like how much do you want to tell people\n\n25:23.240 --> 25:24.880\n about really what went down?\n\n25:24.880 --> 25:27.320\n There's NDAs potentially involved.\n\n25:27.320 --> 25:32.320\n How much in private do you want to push back\n\n25:32.720 --> 25:36.240\n and say, no, fuck you, to centralize power?\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:37.560\n Whatever the phone calls you're getting,\n\n25:37.560 --> 25:40.200\n which I'm sure he was getting some kind of phone calls\n\n25:40.200 --> 25:42.080\n that might not be contractual.\n\n25:42.080 --> 25:44.160\n Like it's not contracts that are forcing him,\n\n25:44.160 --> 25:47.400\n but he was being, what do you call it?\n\n25:47.400 --> 25:49.960\n Like pressured to behave in certain kinds of ways\n\n25:49.960 --> 25:51.560\n from all kinds of directions.\n\n25:51.560 --> 25:55.760\n Like what do you take from this whole situation?\n\n25:55.760 --> 25:58.320\n I was very excited to see Vlad's response.\n\n25:58.320 --> 26:00.920\n I mean, it's pretty cool to have him talk to Elon.\n\n26:00.920 --> 26:02.840\n And one of the things that like struck me\n\n26:02.840 --> 26:06.320\n in the first like few seconds of Vlad speaking was like,\n\n26:06.320 --> 26:10.920\n I was like, is Vlad like a boomer?\n\n26:10.920 --> 26:13.120\n Like, but hear me out.\n\n26:13.120 --> 26:16.200\n Like he seemed like a 55 year old man\n\n26:16.200 --> 26:18.080\n talking to a 20 year old.\n\n26:18.080 --> 26:19.920\n Elon was like the 20 year old.\n\n26:19.920 --> 26:21.920\n And he's like the 55 year old man.\n\n26:21.920 --> 26:25.280\n You can see why Citadel are NMR buddies, right?\n\n26:25.280 --> 26:27.800\n Like you can, you can see why.\n\n26:27.800 --> 26:30.200\n It's like, this is a nice, it's not a bad thing.\n\n26:30.200 --> 26:35.200\n It's like, he's got a respectable professional attitude.\n\n26:35.400 --> 26:38.120\n Well, he also tried to do like a jokey thing.\n\n26:38.120 --> 26:41.360\n Like, no, we're not being ageist here.\n\n26:41.360 --> 26:46.360\n Boomer, but like a 60 year old CEO of Bank of America\n\n26:46.880 --> 26:48.400\n would try to make a joke for the kids.\n\n26:48.400 --> 26:49.840\n That's what Vlad's like.\n\n26:49.840 --> 26:51.760\n Yeah, I was like, what is this?\n\n26:51.760 --> 26:53.680\n This guy's like, what is he, 30?\n\n26:53.680 --> 26:55.040\n Yeah.\n\n26:55.040 --> 26:56.840\n And I'm like, this is weird.\n\n26:56.840 --> 26:58.040\n Yeah.\n\n26:58.040 --> 27:00.480\n But I think, and maybe that's also what I like\n\n27:00.480 --> 27:03.520\n about Elon's kind of influence on American business\n\n27:03.520 --> 27:07.280\n is like, he's super like anti the professional.\n\n27:07.280 --> 27:12.280\n Like why say, you know, a hundred words about nothing?\n\n27:13.120 --> 27:15.320\n And so I liked how he was cutting in and saying,\n\n27:15.320 --> 27:16.160\n Vlad, what do you mean?\n\n27:16.160 --> 27:17.440\n Spill the beans, bro.\n\n27:17.440 --> 27:19.520\n Yeah, so you don't have to be courteous.\n\n27:19.520 --> 27:21.040\n It's like the first principles thinking.\n\n27:21.040 --> 27:23.200\n It's like, what the hell happened?\n\n27:23.200 --> 27:24.040\n Yes.\n\n27:24.040 --> 27:26.600\n Let's just talk like normal people.\n\n27:26.600 --> 27:31.600\n The problem of course is, you know, for Elon,\n\n27:31.600 --> 27:33.320\n it's cost them, what is it?\n\n27:33.320 --> 27:36.520\n Tens of millions of dollars is tweeting like that.\n\n27:36.520 --> 27:39.680\n But perhaps it's a worthy price to pay\n\n27:39.680 --> 27:42.160\n because ultimately there's something magical\n\n27:42.160 --> 27:45.840\n about just being real and honest\n\n27:45.840 --> 27:48.320\n and just going off the cuff and making the mistakes\n\n27:48.320 --> 27:50.800\n and paying for them, but just being real.\n\n27:50.800 --> 27:52.880\n And then moments like this,\n\n27:52.880 --> 27:55.080\n that was an opportunity for Vlad to be that.\n\n27:55.080 --> 27:56.480\n And it felt like he wasn't.\n\n27:57.400 --> 28:02.400\n Do you think we'll ever find out what really went down\n\n28:02.600 --> 28:05.200\n if there was something shady underneath it all?\n\n28:05.200 --> 28:09.800\n Yeah, I mean, it would be sad if nothing shady happened,\n\n28:09.800 --> 28:12.120\n but his presence made it shady.\n\n28:12.120 --> 28:15.240\n Sometimes I feel like that would mark Zuckerberg,\n\n28:15.240 --> 28:18.000\n the CEO of Facebook.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:19.040\n Sometimes I feel like, yeah,\n\n28:19.040 --> 28:22.280\n there's a lot of shitty things that Facebook is doing,\n\n28:22.280 --> 28:25.120\n but sometimes I think he makes it look worse\n\n28:25.120 --> 28:28.440\n by the way he presents himself about those things.\n\n28:28.440 --> 28:31.400\n Like I honestly think that a large amount of people\n\n28:31.400 --> 28:36.400\n at Facebook just have a huge unstable chaotic system\n\n28:36.800 --> 28:40.760\n and they're all, not all, but mass are trying to do good\n\n28:40.760 --> 28:42.320\n with this chaotic system.\n\n28:42.320 --> 28:43.760\n But the presentation is like,\n\n28:43.760 --> 28:47.680\n it sounds like there's a lot of back room conversations\n\n28:47.680 --> 28:49.640\n that are trying to manipulate people.\n\n28:49.640 --> 28:53.400\n And there's something about the realness that Elon has\n\n28:53.400 --> 28:55.720\n that it feels like CEO should have\n\n28:55.720 --> 28:57.200\n and Vlad had that opportunity.\n\n28:57.200 --> 28:59.840\n I think Mark Zuckerberg had that too when he was younger.\n\n28:59.840 --> 29:00.680\n Younger.\n\n29:00.680 --> 29:02.800\n And somebody said, you gotta be more professional, man.\n\n29:02.800 --> 29:06.880\n You can't say, you know, lol to an interview.\n\n29:06.880 --> 29:10.720\n And then suddenly he became like this distant person\n\n29:10.720 --> 29:11.560\n that was hot.\n\n29:11.560 --> 29:13.400\n Like you'd rather have him make mistakes,\n\n29:13.400 --> 29:16.080\n but be honest than be like professional\n\n29:16.080 --> 29:18.000\n and never make mistakes.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:22.000\n Yeah, one of the difficult hires I think\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:25.680\n is like marketing people or like PR people\n\n29:25.680 --> 29:28.320\n is you have to hire people that get the fact\n\n29:28.320 --> 29:31.000\n that you can say lol on an interview.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:36.000\n Or, you know, take risks as opposed to what the PR,\n\n29:37.200 --> 29:39.720\n I've talked to quite a few big CEOs\n\n29:39.720 --> 29:44.720\n and the people around them are trying to constantly\n\n29:44.720 --> 29:48.000\n minimize risk of like, what if he says the wrong thing?\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:49.480\n What if she says the wrong thing?\n\n29:49.480 --> 29:51.360\n It's like, what, be careful.\n\n29:51.360 --> 29:53.720\n It's constantly like, ooh, like, I don't know.\n\n29:53.720 --> 29:56.560\n And there's this nervous energy that builds up over time\n\n29:56.560 --> 29:59.720\n with larger and larger teams where the whole thing,\n\n29:59.720 --> 30:01.520\n like I visited YouTube, for example.\n\n30:01.520 --> 30:05.080\n Everybody I talked at YouTube, incredible engineering\n\n30:05.080 --> 30:07.600\n and incredible system, but everybody's scared.\n\n30:08.520 --> 30:13.080\n Like, let's be honest about this like madness\n\n30:13.080 --> 30:15.840\n that we have going on of huge amounts of video\n\n30:15.840 --> 30:17.640\n that we can't possibly ever handle.\n\n30:17.640 --> 30:19.680\n There's a bunch of hate on YouTube.\n\n30:19.680 --> 30:21.480\n There's this chaos of comments,\n\n30:21.480 --> 30:24.280\n bunch of conspiracy theories, some of which might be true.\n\n30:24.280 --> 30:27.360\n And then just like this mess that we're dealing with\n\n30:27.360 --> 30:30.160\n and it's exciting, it's beautiful.\n\n30:30.160 --> 30:32.840\n It's a place where like democratizes education,\n\n30:32.840 --> 30:34.200\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n30:34.200 --> 30:36.920\n And instead they're all like sitting in like,\n\n30:36.920 --> 30:38.720\n trying to be very polite and saying like,\n\n30:38.720 --> 30:41.640\n well, we just want to improve the health of our platforms.\n\n30:41.640 --> 30:44.720\n Like, it's like this discussion like,\n\n30:44.720 --> 30:46.040\n all right, man, let's just be real.\n\n30:46.040 --> 30:50.480\n Let's both advertise how amazing this fricking thing is,\n\n30:50.480 --> 30:53.200\n but also to say like, we don't know what we're doing.\n\n30:53.200 --> 30:56.040\n We have all these Nazis posting videos on YouTube.\n\n30:56.040 --> 30:58.040\n We don't know how to like handle it.\n\n30:58.040 --> 31:00.000\n And just being real like that,\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.240\n because I suppose that's just a skill.\n\n31:02.240 --> 31:05.080\n Maybe it can't be taught, but over time,\n\n31:05.080 --> 31:06.960\n the whatever the dynamics of the company is,\n\n31:06.960 --> 31:09.840\n it does seem like Zuckerberg and others get worn down.\n\n31:09.840 --> 31:10.960\n They just get tired.\n\n31:10.960 --> 31:11.920\n Yeah.\n\n31:11.920 --> 31:12.760\n They get tired of.\n\n31:12.760 --> 31:13.720\n Not being real.\n\n31:13.720 --> 31:16.360\n Of not being real, which is sad.\n\n31:16.360 --> 31:17.720\n So let's talk about Numerai,\n\n31:17.720 --> 31:22.720\n which is an incredible company system idea, I think,\n\n31:24.680 --> 31:26.520\n but good place to start.\n\n31:26.520 --> 31:29.440\n What is Numerai and how does it work?\n\n31:30.600 --> 31:32.960\n So Numerai is the first hedge fund\n\n31:32.960 --> 31:35.160\n that gives away all of its data.\n\n31:35.160 --> 31:37.640\n So this is like probably the last thing\n\n31:37.640 --> 31:39.160\n a hedge fund would do, right?\n\n31:39.160 --> 31:40.280\n Why would we give away a data?\n\n31:40.280 --> 31:41.920\n It's like giving away your edge.\n\n31:42.960 --> 31:46.840\n But the reason we do it is because we're looking for people\n\n31:46.840 --> 31:49.080\n to model our data.\n\n31:49.080 --> 31:52.840\n And the way we do it is by obfuscating the data.\n\n31:52.840 --> 31:55.360\n So when you look at Numerai's data\n\n31:55.360 --> 31:57.520\n that you can download for free,\n\n31:57.520 --> 32:00.440\n it just looks like a million rows\n\n32:00.440 --> 32:02.920\n of numbers between zero and one.\n\n32:02.920 --> 32:05.280\n And you have no idea what the columns mean,\n\n32:05.280 --> 32:09.120\n but you do know that if you're good at machine learning\n\n32:09.120 --> 32:11.520\n or have done regressions before,\n\n32:11.520 --> 32:14.640\n you know that I can still find patterns in this data,\n\n32:14.640 --> 32:17.560\n even though I don't know what the features mean.\n\n32:17.560 --> 32:20.480\n And the data itself is a time series data.\n\n32:20.480 --> 32:24.480\n And even though it's obfuscated, anonymized,\n\n32:24.480 --> 32:26.920\n what is the source data like approximately?\n\n32:26.920 --> 32:27.960\n What are we talking about?\n\n32:27.960 --> 32:32.360\n So we are buying data from lots of different data vendors\n\n32:32.360 --> 32:35.680\n and they would also never want us to share that data.\n\n32:36.600 --> 32:38.560\n So we have strict contracts with them.\n\n32:38.560 --> 32:41.200\n So we only can,\n\n32:41.200 --> 32:43.480\n but that's the kind of data you could never buy yourself\n\n32:43.480 --> 32:46.760\n unless you had maybe a million dollars a year\n\n32:46.760 --> 32:48.760\n of budget to buy data.\n\n32:48.760 --> 32:50.600\n So what's happened with the hedge fund industry\n\n32:50.600 --> 32:54.600\n is you have a lot of talented people\n\n32:54.600 --> 32:59.600\n who used to be able to trade and still can trade,\n\n32:59.640 --> 33:02.200\n but now they have such a data disadvantage,\n\n33:02.200 --> 33:07.120\n it would never make sense for them to trade themselves.\n\n33:07.120 --> 33:09.640\n But Numerai, by giving away this obfuscated data,\n\n33:09.640 --> 33:12.240\n we can give them a really, really high quality data set\n\n33:12.240 --> 33:14.800\n that would otherwise be very expensive.\n\n33:14.800 --> 33:18.680\n And they can use whatever new machine learning technique\n\n33:18.680 --> 33:22.040\n they want to find patterns in that data\n\n33:22.040 --> 33:24.000\n that we can use in our hedge fund.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:27.080\n And so how much variety is there in underlying data?\n\n33:27.080 --> 33:28.120\n We're talking about,\n\n33:29.560 --> 33:31.080\n I apologize if I'm using the wrong terms,\n\n33:31.080 --> 33:34.360\n but one is just like the stock price.\n\n33:34.360 --> 33:36.840\n The other, there's like options and all that kind of stuff,\n\n33:36.840 --> 33:39.800\n like the, what are they called, order books or whatever.\n\n33:41.520 --> 33:45.320\n Is there maybe other totally unrelated\n\n33:45.320 --> 33:47.120\n directly to the stock market data,\n\n33:47.120 --> 33:51.320\n like natural language as well, all that kind of stuff?\n\n33:51.320 --> 33:55.120\n Yeah, we were really focused on stock data\n\n33:55.120 --> 33:56.560\n that's specific to stocks.\n\n33:56.560 --> 33:59.840\n So things like you can have like a,\n\n33:59.840 --> 34:01.880\n every stock has like a PE ratio.\n\n34:01.880 --> 34:03.800\n For some stocks, it's not as meaningful,\n\n34:03.800 --> 34:05.560\n but every stock has that.\n\n34:05.560 --> 34:07.560\n Every stock has one year momentum,\n\n34:07.560 --> 34:09.760\n how much they went up in the last year,\n\n34:10.680 --> 34:12.520\n but those are very common factors.\n\n34:12.520 --> 34:15.400\n But we try to get lots and lots of those factors\n\n34:15.400 --> 34:17.040\n that we have for many, many years,\n\n34:17.040 --> 34:19.520\n like 15, 20 years history.\n\n34:21.520 --> 34:25.680\n And then the setup of the problem is commonly in quant\n\n34:25.680 --> 34:28.120\n called like cross sectional global equity.\n\n34:28.120 --> 34:29.720\n You're not really trying to say,\n\n34:29.720 --> 34:31.920\n I believe this stock will go up.\n\n34:31.920 --> 34:36.240\n You're trying to say the relative position of this stock\n\n34:36.240 --> 34:41.240\n in feature space makes it not a bad buy in a portfolio.\n\n34:41.720 --> 34:44.480\n So it captures some period of time\n\n34:44.480 --> 34:46.040\n and you're trying to find the patterns,\n\n34:46.040 --> 34:49.920\n the dynamics captured by the data of that period of time\n\n34:49.920 --> 34:51.760\n in order to make short term predictions\n\n34:51.760 --> 34:53.160\n about what's going to happen.\n\n34:53.160 --> 34:55.720\n Yeah, so our predictions are also not that short.\n\n34:55.720 --> 34:58.760\n We're not really caring about things like order books\n\n34:58.760 --> 35:02.360\n and tech data, not high frequency at all.\n\n35:02.360 --> 35:05.080\n We're actually holding things for quite a bit longer.\n\n35:05.080 --> 35:07.800\n So our prediction time horizon is about one month.\n\n35:07.800 --> 35:08.840\n We end up holding stocks\n\n35:08.840 --> 35:10.760\n for maybe like three or four months.\n\n35:10.760 --> 35:12.440\n So I kind of believe that's a little bit more\n\n35:12.440 --> 35:17.440\n like investing than kind of plumbing,\n\n35:17.840 --> 35:21.840\n like to go long a stock that's mispriced on one exchange\n\n35:21.840 --> 35:26.120\n and short on another exchange, that's just arbitrage.\n\n35:26.120 --> 35:30.000\n But what we're trying to do is really know something more\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.920\n about the longer term future of the stock.\n\n35:31.920 --> 35:33.320\n Yeah, so from the patterns,\n\n35:33.320 --> 35:37.000\n from these like periods of time series data,\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.480\n you're trying to understand something fundamental\n\n35:39.480 --> 35:43.280\n about the stock, not like about deep value,\n\n35:43.280 --> 35:46.360\n about like it's big in the context of the market,\n\n35:46.360 --> 35:48.880\n is it underpriced, overpriced, all that kind of stuff.\n\n35:48.880 --> 35:50.800\n So like, this is about investing.\n\n35:50.800 --> 35:52.840\n It's not about like, just like you said,\n\n35:52.840 --> 35:54.640\n high frequency trading,\n\n35:54.640 --> 35:57.040\n which I think is a fascinating open question\n\n35:57.040 --> 35:58.480\n from a machine learning perspective,\n\n35:58.480 --> 36:00.880\n but just to like sort of build on that.\n\n36:00.880 --> 36:02.800\n So you've anonymized the data\n\n36:02.800 --> 36:05.240\n and now you're giving away the data.\n\n36:05.240 --> 36:10.240\n And then now anyone can try to build algorithms\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.760\n that make investing decisions on top of that data\n\n36:14.760 --> 36:16.440\n or predictions on the top of that data.\n\n36:16.440 --> 36:17.280\n Exactly.\n\n36:17.280 --> 36:21.400\n And so that's, what does that look like?\n\n36:21.400 --> 36:22.240\n What's the goal of that?\n\n36:22.240 --> 36:24.440\n What are the underlying principles of that?\n\n36:24.440 --> 36:26.320\n So the first thing is,\n\n36:26.320 --> 36:29.080\n we could obviously model that data in house, right?\n\n36:29.080 --> 36:32.240\n We can make an XGBoost model on the data\n\n36:33.320 --> 36:36.200\n and that would be quite good too.\n\n36:36.200 --> 36:40.240\n But what we're trying to do is by opening it up\n\n36:40.240 --> 36:42.160\n and letting anybody participate,\n\n36:43.040 --> 36:47.560\n we can do quite a lot better than if we modeled it ourselves\n\n36:47.560 --> 36:50.120\n and a lot better on the stock market\n\n36:50.120 --> 36:52.120\n doesn't need to be very much.\n\n36:52.120 --> 36:54.000\n Like it really matters the difference\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.520\n between if you can make 10 and 12%\n\n36:56.520 --> 36:58.560\n in an equity market neutral hedge fund\n\n36:58.560 --> 37:02.800\n because usually you're charging 2% fees.\n\n37:02.800 --> 37:05.080\n So if you can do 2% better,\n\n37:05.080 --> 37:07.600\n that's like all your fees, it's worth it.\n\n37:07.600 --> 37:09.440\n So we're trying to make sure\n\n37:09.440 --> 37:11.360\n that we always have the best possible model\n\n37:11.360 --> 37:13.320\n as new machine learning libraries come out,\n\n37:13.320 --> 37:14.960\n new techniques come out,\n\n37:14.960 --> 37:16.760\n they get automatically synthesized.\n\n37:16.760 --> 37:19.840\n Like if there's a great paper on supervised learning,\n\n37:19.840 --> 37:21.840\n someone on Numerai will figure out\n\n37:21.840 --> 37:23.480\n how to use it on Numerai's data.\n\n37:23.480 --> 37:28.480\n And is there an ensemble of models going on\n\n37:28.960 --> 37:33.440\n or is it more towards kind of like one or two or three\n\n37:33.440 --> 37:35.360\n like best performing models?\n\n37:35.360 --> 37:37.760\n So the way we decide on how to weight\n\n37:37.760 --> 37:40.360\n all of the predictions together\n\n37:40.360 --> 37:44.720\n is by how much the users are staking on them.\n\n37:44.720 --> 37:46.280\n How much of the cryptocurrency\n\n37:46.280 --> 37:48.280\n that they're putting behind their models.\n\n37:48.280 --> 37:51.280\n So they're saying, I believe in my model.\n\n37:51.280 --> 37:54.280\n You can trust me because I'm gonna put skin in the game.\n\n37:55.320 --> 37:57.960\n And so we can take the stake weighted predictions\n\n37:57.960 --> 38:01.040\n from all our users, add those together,\n\n38:01.040 --> 38:02.240\n average those together,\n\n38:02.240 --> 38:05.920\n and that's a much better model than any one model\n\n38:05.920 --> 38:08.800\n in the sum because ensembling a lot of models together\n\n38:08.800 --> 38:12.400\n is kind of the key thing you need to do in investing too.\n\n38:12.400 --> 38:14.520\n Yeah, so you're putting,\n\n38:14.520 --> 38:16.800\n so there's a kind of duality from the user,\n\n38:16.800 --> 38:19.360\n from the perspective of a machine learning engineer\n\n38:19.360 --> 38:22.480\n where it's both a competition, just a really interesting,\n\n38:22.480 --> 38:24.720\n difficult machine learning problem,\n\n38:24.720 --> 38:29.720\n and it's a way to invest algorithmically.\n\n38:29.840 --> 38:33.800\n So like, but the way to invest algorithmically\n\n38:33.800 --> 38:37.360\n also is a way to put skin in the game\n\n38:37.360 --> 38:42.360\n that communicates to you that the quality of the algorithm\n\n38:42.840 --> 38:46.960\n and also forces you to really be serious\n\n38:46.960 --> 38:49.440\n about the models that you build.\n\n38:49.440 --> 38:52.320\n So it's like, everything just works nicely together.\n\n38:52.320 --> 38:54.640\n Like, I guess one way to say that\n\n38:54.640 --> 38:56.600\n is the interests are aligned.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:02.320\n Okay, so it's just like poker is not fun\n\n39:02.320 --> 39:04.760\n when it's like for very low stakes.\n\n39:04.760 --> 39:05.880\n The higher the stakes,\n\n39:05.880 --> 39:07.480\n the more the dynamics of the system\n\n39:07.480 --> 39:09.200\n starts playing out correctly.\n\n39:10.760 --> 39:12.120\n Like as a small side note,\n\n39:12.120 --> 39:16.480\n is there something you can say about which kind,\n\n39:16.480 --> 39:19.240\n looking at the big broad view of machine learning today\n\n39:19.240 --> 39:24.240\n or AI, what kind of algorithms seem to do good\n\n39:24.640 --> 39:27.120\n in these kinds of competitions at this time?\n\n39:27.120 --> 39:29.960\n Is there some universal thing you can say,\n\n39:29.960 --> 39:32.040\n like neural networks suck,\n\n39:32.040 --> 39:34.480\n recurrent neural networks suck, transformers suck,\n\n39:34.480 --> 39:37.680\n or they're awesome, like old school,\n\n39:37.680 --> 39:40.360\n sort of more basic kind of classifiers are better,\n\n39:40.360 --> 39:42.440\n all that, is there some kind of conclusions\n\n39:42.440 --> 39:44.040\n so far that you can say?\n\n39:44.040 --> 39:47.640\n There is definitely something pretty nice about tree models,\n\n39:47.640 --> 39:50.160\n like XGBoost,\n\n39:50.160 --> 39:53.120\n and they just seem to work pretty nicely\n\n39:53.120 --> 39:54.880\n on this type of data.\n\n39:54.880 --> 39:56.320\n So out of the box,\n\n39:56.320 --> 39:59.480\n if you're trying to come a hundredth\n\n39:59.480 --> 40:01.400\n in the competition, in the tournament,\n\n40:01.400 --> 40:03.000\n maybe you would try to use that.\n\n40:04.080 --> 40:09.080\n But what's particularly interesting about the problem\n\n40:09.240 --> 40:11.800\n that not many people understand,\n\n40:11.800 --> 40:14.680\n if you're familiar with machine learning,\n\n40:14.680 --> 40:18.400\n this typically will surprise you when you model our data.\n\n40:18.400 --> 40:23.400\n So one of the things that you look at in finance\n\n40:23.920 --> 40:28.240\n is you don't wanna be too exposed to any one risk.\n\n40:28.240 --> 40:33.240\n Like, even if the best sector in the world\n\n40:33.840 --> 40:36.560\n to invest in over the last 10 years was tech,\n\n40:37.960 --> 40:40.760\n does not mean you should put all of your money into tech.\n\n40:40.760 --> 40:42.880\n So if you train a model,\n\n40:42.880 --> 40:45.680\n it would say, put all your money in tech, it's super good.\n\n40:45.680 --> 40:49.040\n But what you wanna do is actually be very careful\n\n40:49.040 --> 40:53.360\n of how much of this exposure you have to certain features.\n\n40:53.360 --> 40:58.360\n So on Numeri, what a lot of people figure out is,\n\n40:58.400 --> 41:02.040\n actually, if you train a model on this kind of data,\n\n41:02.040 --> 41:05.400\n you wanna somehow neutralize or minimize your exposure\n\n41:05.400 --> 41:08.160\n to these certain features, which is unusual,\n\n41:08.160 --> 41:11.840\n because if you did train a stoplight\n\n41:11.840 --> 41:15.880\n or stop street detection on computer vision,\n\n41:18.080 --> 41:21.720\n your favorite feature, let's say you have an auto encoder\n\n41:21.720 --> 41:23.320\n and it's figuring out, okay, it's gotta be red\n\n41:23.320 --> 41:25.040\n and it's gotta be white,\n\n41:25.040 --> 41:30.040\n that's the last thing you wanna reduce your exposure to.\n\n41:30.280 --> 41:31.440\n Why would you reduce your exposure\n\n41:31.440 --> 41:34.520\n to the thing that's helping your model the most?\n\n41:34.520 --> 41:36.360\n And that's actually this counterintuitive thing\n\n41:36.360 --> 41:38.600\n you have to do with machine learning on financial data.\n\n41:38.600 --> 41:41.760\n So reducing your exposure\n\n41:41.760 --> 41:44.040\n would help you generalize the things that are...\n\n41:44.040 --> 41:48.600\n So basically, a financial data has a large amount\n\n41:48.600 --> 41:51.560\n of patterns that appeared in the past\n\n41:51.560 --> 41:53.240\n and also a large amount of patterns\n\n41:53.240 --> 41:55.040\n that have not appeared in the past.\n\n41:55.040 --> 41:56.160\n And so like in that sense,\n\n41:56.160 --> 41:59.880\n you have to reduce the exposure to red lights,\n\n41:59.880 --> 42:02.440\n to the color red.\n\n42:02.440 --> 42:05.080\n That's interesting, but how much of this is art\n\n42:05.080 --> 42:07.920\n and how much of it is science from your perspective so far\n\n42:09.080 --> 42:11.080\n in terms of as you start to climb\n\n42:11.080 --> 42:16.000\n from the 100th position to the 95th in the competition?\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:20.360\n Yeah, well, if you do make yourself super exposed\n\n42:20.360 --> 42:23.200\n to one or two features,\n\n42:23.200 --> 42:25.680\n you can have a lot of volatility\n\n42:25.680 --> 42:26.920\n when you're playing Numerai.\n\n42:26.920 --> 42:31.200\n You could maybe very rapidly rise to be high\n\n42:31.200 --> 42:33.000\n if you were getting lucky.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:34.240\n Yes.\n\n42:34.240 --> 42:36.120\n And that's a bit like the stock market.\n\n42:36.120 --> 42:38.800\n Sure, take on massive risk exposure,\n\n42:38.800 --> 42:41.040\n put all your money into one stock\n\n42:41.040 --> 42:43.640\n and you might make 100%,\n\n42:43.640 --> 42:47.680\n but it doesn't in the long run work out very well.\n\n42:47.680 --> 42:52.680\n And so the best users are trying to stay high\n\n42:53.520 --> 42:55.920\n for as long as possible,\n\n42:55.920 --> 43:00.040\n not necessarily try to be first for a little bit.\n\n43:00.040 --> 43:04.840\n So me, a developer, machine learning researcher,\n\n43:04.840 --> 43:07.920\n how do I, Lex Friedman, participate in this competition\n\n43:07.920 --> 43:09.400\n and how do others,\n\n43:09.400 --> 43:10.840\n which I'm sure there'll be a lot of others\n\n43:10.840 --> 43:12.920\n interested in participating in this competition,\n\n43:12.920 --> 43:15.720\n what are, let's see, there's like a million questions,\n\n43:15.720 --> 43:19.640\n but like first one is how do I get started?\n\n43:19.640 --> 43:22.440\n Well, you can go to numero.ai,\n\n43:22.440 --> 43:24.600\n sign up, download the data.\n\n43:24.600 --> 43:29.600\n And on the data is pretty small.\n\n43:30.080 --> 43:32.000\n In the data pack you download,\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.960\n there's like an example script,\n\n43:33.960 --> 43:37.840\n Python script that just builds a XGBoost model\n\n43:37.840 --> 43:39.360\n very quickly from the data.\n\n43:40.720 --> 43:44.000\n And so in a very short time,\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.080\n you can have an example model.\n\n43:46.080 --> 43:47.680\n Is that a particular structure?\n\n43:47.680 --> 43:50.680\n Like what, is this model then submitted somewhere?\n\n43:50.680 --> 43:52.520\n So there needs to be some kind of structure\n\n43:52.520 --> 43:54.760\n that communicates with some kind of API.\n\n43:54.760 --> 43:56.480\n Like how does the whole,\n\n43:56.480 --> 43:58.640\n how does your model, once you've built,\n\n43:58.640 --> 44:01.440\n once you create a little baby Frankenstein,\n\n44:01.440 --> 44:02.760\n how does it then live in the world?\n\n44:02.760 --> 44:05.120\n Okay, well, we want you to keep your baby Frankenstein\n\n44:05.120 --> 44:06.880\n at home and take care of it.\n\n44:06.880 --> 44:07.920\n We don't want it.\n\n44:07.920 --> 44:10.760\n So you never upload your model to us.\n\n44:10.760 --> 44:14.680\n You always only giving us predictions.\n\n44:14.680 --> 44:17.160\n So we never see the code that wrote your model,\n\n44:17.160 --> 44:18.160\n which is pretty cool,\n\n44:18.160 --> 44:20.560\n that our whole hedge fund is built from models\n\n44:20.560 --> 44:22.440\n where we've never, ever seen the code.\n\n44:23.720 --> 44:27.040\n But it's important for the users because it's their IP,\n\n44:27.040 --> 44:28.000\n why do they want to give it to us?\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:28.840\n That's brilliant.\n\n44:28.840 --> 44:31.040\n So they've got it themselves,\n\n44:31.040 --> 44:34.200\n but they can basically almost like license\n\n44:34.200 --> 44:36.720\n the predictions from that model to us.\n\n44:36.720 --> 44:38.680\n License the predictions, yeah.\n\n44:38.680 --> 44:40.160\n So. Think about it.\n\n44:40.160 --> 44:43.920\n What some users do is they set up a compute server\n\n44:43.920 --> 44:45.120\n and we call it Numeric Compute.\n\n44:45.120 --> 44:47.280\n It's like a little AWS kind of image\n\n44:47.280 --> 44:50.160\n and you can automate this process.\n\n44:50.160 --> 44:51.200\n So we can ping you.\n\n44:51.200 --> 44:53.000\n We can be like, we need more predictions now.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:54.640\n And then you send it to us.\n\n44:55.520 --> 44:56.360\n Okay, cool.\n\n44:56.360 --> 45:00.080\n So that's, is that described somewhere,\n\n45:00.080 --> 45:02.160\n like what the preferred is, the AWS,\n\n45:02.160 --> 45:04.880\n or whether another cloud platform,\n\n45:04.880 --> 45:07.680\n is there, I mean, is there sort of specific technical things\n\n45:07.680 --> 45:09.600\n you want to say that comes to mind\n\n45:09.600 --> 45:12.800\n that is a good path for getting started?\n\n45:12.800 --> 45:16.040\n So download the data, maybe play around,\n\n45:16.040 --> 45:21.040\n see if you can modify the basic algorithm provided\n\n45:22.160 --> 45:25.760\n in the example.\n\n45:25.760 --> 45:28.600\n And then you, what, set up a little server on the AWS\n\n45:28.600 --> 45:31.840\n that then runs this model and takes pings\n\n45:31.840 --> 45:34.120\n and then makes predictions.\n\n45:34.120 --> 45:37.720\n And so how does your own money actually come into play\n\n45:37.720 --> 45:41.240\n doing the stake of a cryptocurrency?\n\n45:41.240 --> 45:44.120\n Yeah, so you don't have to stake.\n\n45:44.120 --> 45:45.480\n You can start without staking.\n\n45:45.480 --> 45:49.040\n And many users might try for months\n\n45:49.040 --> 45:50.560\n without staking anything at all\n\n45:50.560 --> 45:54.840\n to see if their model works on the real life data, right?\n\n45:54.840 --> 45:57.080\n And is not overfit.\n\n45:57.080 --> 46:01.960\n But then you can get Numeraire many different ways.\n\n46:01.960 --> 46:04.960\n You can buy it on, you can buy some on Coinbase.\n\n46:04.960 --> 46:06.760\n You can buy some on Uniswap.\n\n46:06.760 --> 46:08.200\n You can buy some on Binance.\n\n46:09.240 --> 46:11.160\n So what did you say this is?\n\n46:11.160 --> 46:12.080\n How do you pronounce it?\n\n46:12.080 --> 46:15.040\n So this is the Numeraire cryptocurrency.\n\n46:15.040 --> 46:16.440\n Yeah, NMR.\n\n46:16.440 --> 46:19.280\n NMR, you just say NMR?\n\n46:19.280 --> 46:21.800\n It is technically called Numeraire.\n\n46:21.800 --> 46:23.560\n Numeraire, I like it.\n\n46:23.560 --> 46:26.280\n Yeah, but NMR is simple.\n\n46:26.280 --> 46:27.280\n NMR, Numeraire.\n\n46:27.280 --> 46:31.960\n Okay, so, and you could buy it basically anywhere.\n\n46:31.960 --> 46:33.080\n Yeah, so it's a bit strange\n\n46:33.080 --> 46:34.400\n because sometimes people are like,\n\n46:34.400 --> 46:36.160\n is this like pay to play?\n\n46:36.160 --> 46:37.000\n Right.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:40.800\n And it's like, yeah, you need to put some money down\n\n46:40.800 --> 46:42.600\n to show us you believe in your model.\n\n46:42.600 --> 46:45.160\n But weirdly, we're not selling you the,\n\n46:45.160 --> 46:48.240\n like you can't buy the cryptocurrency from us.\n\n46:48.240 --> 46:49.080\n Right.\n\n46:49.080 --> 46:51.800\n It's like, it's also, we never,\n\n46:51.800 --> 46:56.400\n if you do badly, we destroy your cryptocurrency.\n\n46:57.440 --> 46:58.520\n Okay, that's not good, right?\n\n46:58.520 --> 47:00.000\n You don't want it to be destroyed.\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:03.520\n But what's good about it is it's also not coming to us.\n\n47:03.520 --> 47:04.360\n Right.\n\n47:04.360 --> 47:06.920\n So it's not like we win when you lose or something,\n\n47:06.920 --> 47:08.560\n like we're the house.\n\n47:08.560 --> 47:10.360\n Like we're definitely on the same team.\n\n47:10.360 --> 47:11.200\n Yes.\n\n47:11.200 --> 47:14.200\n Helping us make a hedge fund that's never been done before.\n\n47:14.200 --> 47:15.760\n Yeah, so again, interests are aligned.\n\n47:15.760 --> 47:18.360\n There's no, there's no tension there at all,\n\n47:18.360 --> 47:19.920\n which is really fascinating.\n\n47:19.920 --> 47:21.000\n You're giving away everything\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:24.400\n and then the IP is owned by sort of the code.\n\n47:24.400 --> 47:25.680\n You never share the code.\n\n47:25.680 --> 47:27.120\n That's fascinating.\n\n47:27.120 --> 47:31.000\n So since I have you here and you said a hundred,\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.480\n I didn't ask out of how many, so we'll just,\n\n47:34.960 --> 47:37.960\n but if I then once you get started\n\n47:37.960 --> 47:42.960\n and you find this interesting, how do you then win\n\n47:43.640 --> 47:47.280\n or do well, but also how do you potentially try to win\n\n47:47.280 --> 47:49.880\n if this is something you want to take on seriously\n\n47:49.880 --> 47:51.200\n from the machine learning perspective,\n\n47:51.200 --> 47:53.320\n not from a financial perspective?\n\n47:53.320 --> 47:55.760\n Yeah, I think that first of all,\n\n47:55.760 --> 47:57.240\n you would want to talk to the community.\n\n47:57.240 --> 47:58.880\n People are pretty open.\n\n47:58.880 --> 48:01.960\n We give out really interesting scripts and ideas\n\n48:01.960 --> 48:03.600\n for things you might want to try.\n\n48:03.600 --> 48:08.600\n And, but you're also going to need a lot of compute probably.\n\n48:09.520 --> 48:12.400\n And so some of the best users are, you know,\n\n48:12.400 --> 48:15.400\n actually the very first time someone won on Numerai,\n\n48:15.400 --> 48:17.080\n I would, I wrote them a personal email.\n\n48:17.080 --> 48:18.880\n It's like, you know, you've won some money.\n\n48:18.880 --> 48:21.560\n We're so excited to give you $300.\n\n48:21.560 --> 48:24.120\n And then they said, I spend way more on the compute,\n\n48:26.040 --> 48:26.880\n but.\n\n48:26.880 --> 48:29.200\n So this is fundamentally a machine learning problem first,\n\n48:29.200 --> 48:31.640\n I think is this is one of the exciting things.\n\n48:31.640 --> 48:34.400\n I don't know if we'll, in how many ways we can approach this,\n\n48:34.400 --> 48:39.400\n but really this is less about kind of no offense,\n\n48:40.200 --> 48:43.320\n but like finance people, finance minded people,\n\n48:43.320 --> 48:45.400\n they're also, I'm sure great people,\n\n48:45.400 --> 48:49.640\n but it feels like from the community that I've experienced,\n\n48:49.640 --> 48:52.120\n these are people who see finance\n\n48:52.120 --> 48:57.120\n as a fascinating problem space, source of data,\n\n48:57.520 --> 49:01.240\n but ultimately they're machine learning people or AI people,\n\n49:01.240 --> 49:03.520\n which is a very different kind of flavor of community.\n\n49:03.520 --> 49:05.760\n And I mean, I should say to that,\n\n49:07.560 --> 49:10.640\n I'd love to participate in this and I will participate in this\n\n49:10.640 --> 49:12.840\n and I'd love to hear from other people.\n\n49:12.840 --> 49:13.720\n If you're listening to this,\n\n49:13.720 --> 49:15.520\n if you're a machine learning person,\n\n49:15.520 --> 49:17.640\n you should participate in it and tell me,\n\n49:17.640 --> 49:21.320\n give me some hints how I can do well at this thing.\n\n49:21.320 --> 49:24.200\n Cause this boomer, I'm not sure I still got it,\n\n49:24.200 --> 49:28.360\n but cause some of it is, it's like a Kaggle competitions.\n\n49:28.360 --> 49:33.280\n Like some of it is certainly set of ideas,\n\n49:33.280 --> 49:37.400\n like research ideas, like fundamental innovation,\n\n49:37.400 --> 49:40.000\n but I'm sure some of it is like deeply understanding,\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.680\n getting like an intuition about the data.\n\n49:42.680 --> 49:45.760\n And then like a lot of it will be like figuring out\n\n49:45.760 --> 49:47.760\n like what works, like tricks.\n\n49:47.760 --> 49:50.040\n I mean, you could argue most of deep learning research\n\n49:50.040 --> 49:51.520\n is just tricks on top of tricks,\n\n49:51.520 --> 49:55.880\n but there's some of it is just the art\n\n49:55.880 --> 49:58.800\n of getting to know how to work in a really difficult\n\n49:58.800 --> 50:00.560\n machine learning problem.\n\n50:00.560 --> 50:02.000\n And I think what's important,\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:03.520\n the important difference with something\n\n50:03.520 --> 50:04.720\n like a Kaggle competition,\n\n50:04.720 --> 50:08.320\n where they'll set up this kind of toy problem\n\n50:08.320 --> 50:10.640\n and then there will be an out of sample test,\n\n50:10.640 --> 50:12.320\n like, Hey, you did well out of sample.\n\n50:12.320 --> 50:13.880\n And this is like, okay, cool.\n\n50:14.920 --> 50:19.120\n But what's cool with Numeri is the out of sample\n\n50:19.120 --> 50:20.920\n is the real life stock market.\n\n50:22.080 --> 50:23.400\n We don't even know,\n\n50:23.400 --> 50:25.640\n like we don't know the onset of the problem.\n\n50:25.640 --> 50:28.320\n We don't, like you'll have to find out live.\n\n50:28.320 --> 50:31.640\n And so we've had users who've like submitted every week\n\n50:31.640 --> 50:36.640\n for like four years because it's kind of,\n\n50:38.280 --> 50:40.640\n we say it's the hardest data science problem\n\n50:40.640 --> 50:41.840\n on the planet, right?\n\n50:41.840 --> 50:44.080\n And it sounds maybe sounds like maybe\n\n50:44.080 --> 50:45.600\n but too much for like a marketing thing,\n\n50:45.600 --> 50:48.840\n but it's the hardest because it's the stock market.\n\n50:48.840 --> 50:51.640\n It's like literally there are like billions of dollars\n\n50:51.640 --> 50:55.480\n at stake and like no one's like letting it be inefficient\n\n50:55.480 --> 50:56.680\n on purpose.\n\n50:56.680 --> 50:58.760\n So if you can find something that works at Numeri,\n\n50:58.760 --> 51:01.760\n you really have something that is like working\n\n51:01.760 --> 51:03.680\n on the real stock market.\n\n51:03.680 --> 51:05.720\n Yeah, because there's like humans involved\n\n51:05.720 --> 51:06.560\n in the stock market.\n\n51:06.560 --> 51:09.920\n I mean, you could argue there might be harder data sets\n\n51:09.920 --> 51:11.320\n like maybe predicting the weather,\n\n51:11.320 --> 51:12.280\n all those kinds of things.\n\n51:12.280 --> 51:16.080\n But the fundamental statement here is, which I like,\n\n51:16.080 --> 51:16.920\n I was thinking like,\n\n51:16.920 --> 51:19.520\n is this really the hardest data science problem?\n\n51:19.520 --> 51:21.160\n And you start thinking about that,\n\n51:21.160 --> 51:24.880\n but ultimately it also boils down to a problem\n\n51:24.880 --> 51:26.720\n where the data is accessible.\n\n51:26.720 --> 51:31.320\n It's made accessible, made really easy and efficient\n\n51:31.320 --> 51:33.960\n at like submitting algorithms.\n\n51:33.960 --> 51:35.560\n So it's not just, you know,\n\n51:35.560 --> 51:38.120\n it's not about the data being out there, like the weather.\n\n51:38.120 --> 51:40.480\n It's about making the data super accessible,\n\n51:40.480 --> 51:43.040\n making the ability of community around it.\n\n51:43.040 --> 51:45.200\n Like this is what ImageNet did.\n\n51:45.200 --> 51:46.040\n Exactly.\n\n51:46.040 --> 51:49.080\n Like it's not just, there's always images.\n\n51:49.080 --> 51:51.280\n The point is you aggregate them together.\n\n51:51.280 --> 51:52.680\n You give it a little title.\n\n51:52.680 --> 51:56.920\n This is a community and that was one of the hardest,\n\n51:56.920 --> 51:58.960\n right, for a time.\n\n51:58.960 --> 52:03.960\n And most important data science problems in the world\n\n52:03.960 --> 52:08.680\n because it was accessible, because it was made sort of,\n\n52:08.680 --> 52:12.320\n like there was mechanisms by which like standards\n\n52:12.320 --> 52:14.040\n and mechanisms by which you judge your performance,\n\n52:14.040 --> 52:14.880\n all those kinds of things.\n\n52:14.880 --> 52:17.360\n And Numerize actually step up from that.\n\n52:17.360 --> 52:19.680\n Is there something more you can say about why\n\n52:19.680 --> 52:24.560\n from your perspective it's the hardest problem in the world?\n\n52:24.560 --> 52:26.560\n I mean, you said it's connected to the market.\n\n52:26.560 --> 52:29.320\n So if you could find a pattern in the market,\n\n52:29.320 --> 52:31.200\n that's a really difficult thing to do\n\n52:31.200 --> 52:33.320\n because a lot of people are trying to do it.\n\n52:33.320 --> 52:34.160\n Exactly.\n\n52:34.160 --> 52:37.200\n But there's also the biggest one is\n\n52:37.200 --> 52:40.480\n it's non stationary time series.\n\n52:40.480 --> 52:42.680\n We've tried to regularize the data\n\n52:42.680 --> 52:46.920\n so you can find patterns by doing certain things\n\n52:46.920 --> 52:48.600\n to the features and the target.\n\n52:48.600 --> 52:51.880\n But ultimately you're in a space where you don't,\n\n52:51.880 --> 52:55.720\n there's no guarantees that the out of sample distributions\n\n52:55.720 --> 52:59.680\n will conform to any of the training data.\n\n52:59.680 --> 53:04.680\n And every single era, which we call on the website,\n\n53:04.800 --> 53:07.040\n like every single era in the data,\n\n53:07.040 --> 53:09.840\n which is like sort of showing you the order of the time.\n\n53:12.640 --> 53:16.320\n Even the training data has the same dislocations.\n\n53:16.320 --> 53:21.320\n And so, yeah, and then there's so many things\n\n53:22.360 --> 53:25.880\n that you might wanna try.\n\n53:25.880 --> 53:29.320\n There's unlimited possible number of models, right?\n\n53:30.320 --> 53:35.320\n And so by having it be open,\n\n53:37.520 --> 53:40.600\n we can at least search that space.\n\n53:40.600 --> 53:42.440\n Zooming back out to the philosophical,\n\n53:42.440 --> 53:46.560\n you said that Numerai is very much like Wall Street Bets.\n\n53:46.560 --> 53:51.120\n Is there, I think it'd be interesting\n\n53:51.120 --> 53:52.480\n to dig in why you think so.\n\n53:52.480 --> 53:56.240\n I think you're speaking to the distributed nature of the two\n\n53:56.240 --> 53:59.680\n and the power of the people nature of the two.\n\n53:59.680 --> 54:02.280\n So maybe can you speak to the similarities\n\n54:02.280 --> 54:06.080\n and the differences and in which way is Numerai more powerful\n\n54:06.080 --> 54:09.400\n in which way is Wall Street Bets more powerful?\n\n54:09.400 --> 54:11.000\n Yeah, this is why the Wall Street Bets story\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:12.800\n is so interesting to me because it's like,\n\n54:12.800 --> 54:14.240\n feels like we're connected.\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:16.880\n And looking at how,\n\n54:16.880 --> 54:19.480\n just looking at the form of Wall Street Bets,\n\n54:19.480 --> 54:21.480\n I was talking earlier about how,\n\n54:21.480 --> 54:23.480\n how can you make credible claims?\n\n54:23.480 --> 54:24.360\n You're anonymous.\n\n54:24.360 --> 54:26.920\n Okay, well, maybe you can take a screenshot.\n\n54:26.920 --> 54:29.120\n Or maybe you can upvote someone.\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:31.280\n Maybe you can have karma on Reddit.\n\n54:31.280 --> 54:35.640\n And those kinds of things make this emerging thing possible.\n\n54:35.640 --> 54:40.120\n Numerai, it didn't work at all when we started.\n\n54:40.120 --> 54:41.680\n It didn't work at all.\n\n54:41.680 --> 54:42.560\n Why?\n\n54:42.560 --> 54:43.880\n People made multiple accounts.\n\n54:43.880 --> 54:45.720\n They made really random models\n\n54:45.720 --> 54:47.120\n and hoped they would get lucky.\n\n54:47.120 --> 54:48.520\n And some of them did.\n\n54:48.520 --> 54:49.440\n Yes.\n\n54:49.440 --> 54:53.200\n Staking was our solution to,\n\n54:53.200 --> 54:56.800\n could we make it so that we could trust?\n\n54:56.800 --> 55:00.120\n We could know which model people believed in the most.\n\n55:00.120 --> 55:04.600\n And we could weight models that had high stake more\n\n55:04.600 --> 55:07.840\n and effectively coordinate this group of people\n\n55:07.840 --> 55:10.160\n to be like, well, actually there's no incentive\n\n55:10.160 --> 55:12.560\n to creating bot accounts anymore.\n\n55:12.560 --> 55:14.640\n Either I stake my accounts,\n\n55:14.640 --> 55:16.080\n in which case I should believe in them\n\n55:16.080 --> 55:18.720\n because I could lose my stake or I don't.\n\n55:18.720 --> 55:20.840\n And that's a very powerful thing\n\n55:20.840 --> 55:23.120\n that having a negative incentive\n\n55:23.120 --> 55:26.840\n and a positive incentive can make things a lot better.\n\n55:26.840 --> 55:28.240\n And staking is like this,\n\n55:28.240 --> 55:31.560\n is this really nice like key thing about blockchain.\n\n55:31.560 --> 55:33.760\n It's like something special you can do\n\n55:33.760 --> 55:35.880\n where they're not even trusting us\n\n55:35.880 --> 55:37.560\n with their stake in some ways.\n\n55:37.560 --> 55:40.040\n They're trusting the blockchain, right?\n\n55:40.040 --> 55:42.240\n So the incentives, like you say,\n\n55:42.240 --> 55:44.360\n it's about making these perfect incentives\n\n55:44.360 --> 55:47.920\n so that you can have coordination to solve one problem.\n\n55:47.920 --> 55:52.120\n And nowadays I sleep easy\n\n55:52.120 --> 55:55.680\n because I have less money in my own hedge fund\n\n55:56.680 --> 56:00.640\n than our users are staking on their models.\n\n56:00.640 --> 56:01.680\n That's powerful.\n\n56:01.680 --> 56:04.280\n In some sense, from a human psychology perspective,\n\n56:04.280 --> 56:08.960\n it's fascinating that the WallStreetBets worked at all, right?\n\n56:08.960 --> 56:12.920\n That amidst that chaos, emerging behavior,\n\n56:12.920 --> 56:15.720\n like behavior that made sense emerged.\n\n56:15.720 --> 56:20.160\n It would be fascinating to think if numerized style staking\n\n56:20.160 --> 56:24.880\n could then be transferred to places like Reddit, you know?\n\n56:24.880 --> 56:27.080\n And not necessarily for financial investments,\n\n56:27.080 --> 56:34.360\n but I wish sometimes people would have to stake something\n\n56:34.360 --> 56:36.800\n in the comments they make on the internet.\n\n56:36.800 --> 56:37.840\n Yeah.\n\n56:37.840 --> 56:40.480\n That's the problem with anonymity is like,\n\n56:40.480 --> 56:42.200\n anonymity is freedom and power\n\n56:42.200 --> 56:44.960\n that you don't have to, you can speak your mind,\n\n56:44.960 --> 56:47.760\n but it's too easy to just be shitty.\n\n56:47.760 --> 56:49.840\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n56:49.840 --> 56:52.360\n So this, I mean, you're making me realize\n\n56:52.360 --> 56:58.360\n from a profoundly philosophical aspect, numerized staking\n\n56:58.360 --> 57:01.280\n is a really clean way to solve this problem.\n\n57:01.280 --> 57:02.280\n It's a really beautiful way.\n\n57:02.280 --> 57:05.360\n Of course, it only with Numerai currently works\n\n57:05.360 --> 57:07.760\n for a very particular problem, right?\n\n57:07.760 --> 57:10.280\n Not for human interaction on the internet,\n\n57:10.280 --> 57:11.560\n but that's fascinating.\n\n57:11.560 --> 57:13.520\n Yeah, there's nothing to stop people.\n\n57:13.520 --> 57:17.280\n In fact, we've open sourced the code we use for staking\n\n57:17.280 --> 57:19.960\n in a protocol we call Erasure.\n\n57:19.960 --> 57:23.560\n And if Reddit wanted to, they could even use that code\n\n57:23.560 --> 57:29.040\n to enable staking on our Wall Street pets.\n\n57:29.040 --> 57:30.600\n And they're actually researching now,\n\n57:30.600 --> 57:32.440\n they've had some Ethereum grants\n\n57:32.440 --> 57:37.200\n on how could they have more crypto stuff in there\n\n57:37.200 --> 57:40.360\n in Ethereum, because wouldn't that be interesting?\n\n57:40.360 --> 57:43.920\n Like, imagine you could, instead of seeing a screenshot,\n\n57:43.920 --> 57:49.360\n like, guys, I promise I will not sell my GameStop.\n\n57:49.360 --> 57:50.720\n We're just going to go huge.\n\n57:50.720 --> 57:53.800\n We're not going to sell at all.\n\n57:53.800 --> 57:58.480\n And here is a smart contract, which no one in the world,\n\n57:58.480 --> 58:02.480\n including me, can undo, that says,\n\n58:02.480 --> 58:08.200\n I have staked millions against this claim.\n\n58:08.200 --> 58:09.200\n That's powerful.\n\n58:09.200 --> 58:11.240\n And then what could you do?\n\n58:11.240 --> 58:12.720\n And of course, it doesn't have to be millions.\n\n58:12.720 --> 58:14.560\n It could be just a very small amount,\n\n58:14.560 --> 58:17.480\n but then just a huge number of users doing that kind of stake.\n\n58:17.480 --> 58:20.160\n Exactly.\n\n58:20.160 --> 58:21.920\n That could change the internet.\n\n58:21.920 --> 58:23.960\n It would change, and then Wall Street.\n\n58:23.960 --> 58:25.240\n It would change Wall Street.\n\n58:25.240 --> 58:26.800\n They would never have been able to,\n\n58:26.800 --> 58:29.520\n they would still be short squeezing one day\n\n58:29.520 --> 58:32.680\n after the next, every single hedge fund collapsing.\n\n58:32.680 --> 58:35.360\n If we look into the future, do you think it's possible\n\n58:35.360 --> 58:39.080\n that numerae style infrastructure,\n\n58:39.080 --> 58:44.760\n where AI systems backed by humans are doing the trading,\n\n58:44.760 --> 58:48.200\n is what the entirety of the stock market is,\n\n58:48.200 --> 58:50.240\n or the entirety of the economy, is\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:54.240\n run by basically this army of AI systems\n\n58:54.240 --> 58:57.360\n with high level human supervision?\n\n58:57.360 --> 59:02.640\n Yeah, the thing is that some of them could be bad actors.\n\n59:02.640 --> 59:03.400\n Some of the humans?\n\n59:03.400 --> 59:06.080\n No, well, these systems could be tricky.\n\n59:06.080 --> 59:08.800\n So actually, I once met a hedge fund manager,\n\n59:08.800 --> 59:10.040\n and this is kind of interesting.\n\n59:10.040 --> 59:14.280\n He said, very famous one, and he said,\n\n59:14.280 --> 59:17.600\n we can see, sometimes we can see things in the market\n\n59:17.600 --> 59:22.760\n where we know we can make money, but it will mess shit up.\n\n59:22.760 --> 59:25.360\n We know we can make money, but it will mess things up.\n\n59:25.360 --> 59:28.200\n And we choose not to do those things.\n\n59:28.200 --> 59:30.160\n And on the one hand, maybe this is like, oh, you're\n\n59:30.160 --> 59:31.920\n being super arrogant.\n\n59:31.920 --> 59:35.240\n Of course you can't do this, but maybe he can.\n\n59:35.240 --> 59:38.280\n And maybe he really isn't doing things\n\n59:38.280 --> 59:43.560\n he knows he could do, but would be pretty bad.\n\n59:43.560 --> 59:51.760\n Would the Reddit army have that kind of morality or concern\n\n59:51.760 --> 59:53.680\n for what they're doing?\n\n59:53.680 --> 59:55.560\n Probably not, based on what we've seen.\n\n59:55.560 --> 59:57.600\n The madness of crowds.\n\n59:57.600 --> 1:00:00.840\n There'll be one person that says, hey, maybe,\n\n1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:03.920\n and then they get trampled over.\n\n1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:07.320\n That's the terrifying thing, actually.\n\n1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:08.960\n A lot of people have written about this,\n\n1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:13.880\n is somehow that little voice that's human morality\n\n1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:17.920\n gets silenced when we get into groups and start chanting.\n\n1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:18.760\n And that's terrifying.\n\n1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:22.320\n But I think maybe I misunderstood.\n\n1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:25.920\n I thought that you're saying AI systems can be dangerous,\n\n1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:28.440\n but you just describe how humans can be dangerous.\n\n1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:30.520\n So which is safer?\n\n1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:38.640\n So one thing is, so Wall Street bets these kinds of attacks.\n\n1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:42.080\n It's not possible to model, numerize data,\n\n1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:45.000\n and then come up with the idea from the model,\n\n1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.920\n let's short squeak, just game stop.\n\n1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:49.440\n It's not even framed in that way.\n\n1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:52.800\n It's not possible to have that idea.\n\n1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:54.960\n But it is possible for a bunch of humans.\n\n1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:59.680\n So I think this, it's, numera could get very powerful\n\n1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:01.840\n without it being dangerous.\n\n1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:05.480\n But Wall Street bets needs to get a little bit more powerful,\n\n1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:08.240\n and it'll be pretty dangerous.\n\n1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:11.960\n Yeah, well, I mean, this is a good place\n\n1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:17.040\n to think about numera data today and numera signals\n\n1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:22.680\n and what that looks like in 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 years.\n\n1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:24.520\n Right now, I guess, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:28.040\n but the data that we're working with is like a window.\n\n1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:32.320\n It's an anonymized, obfuscated window\n\n1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:36.640\n into a particular aspect, time period of the market.\n\n1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:40.440\n And you can expand that more and more and more and more,\n\n1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:41.160\n potentially.\n\n1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:43.560\n You can imagine in different dimensions\n\n1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:47.120\n to where it encapsulates all the things that,\n\n1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.080\n where you could include kind of human to human communication\n\n1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:55.960\n that was available to buy GameStop, for example,\n\n1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:57.640\n on Wall Street bets.\n\n1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:00.000\n So maybe as a step back, can you speak\n\n1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:05.480\n to what is numera signals and what are the different data\n\n1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:07.600\n sets that are involved?\n\n1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:10.800\n So with numera signals, you're still\n\n1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:15.800\n providing predictions to us, but you can do it\n\n1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:18.080\n from your own data sets.\n\n1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:21.040\n So numera, it's all you have to model our data\n\n1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:22.760\n to come up with predictions.\n\n1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:26.560\n Numa signals is whatever data you can find out there,\n\n1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:29.880\n you can turn it into a signal and give it to us.\n\n1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:32.600\n So it's a way for us to import signals\n\n1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:36.800\n on data we don't yet have.\n\n1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:38.720\n And that's why it's particularly valuable,\n\n1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:42.240\n because it's going to be signals.\n\n1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:44.200\n You're only rewarded for signals that are\n\n1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:47.600\n orthogonal to our core signal.\n\n1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:50.040\n So you have to be doing something uncorrelated.\n\n1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:55.000\n And so strange alternative data tends to have that property.\n\n1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.280\n There isn't too many other signals\n\n1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:02.320\n that are correlated with what's happening on Wall Street\n\n1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:02.920\n bets.\n\n1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:05.440\n That's not going to be correlated with the price\n\n1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:07.760\n to earnings ratio.\n\n1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:11.600\n And we have some users, as of recently, as of a week ago,\n\n1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:14.600\n there was a user that created, I think he's in India,\n\n1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:21.400\n he created a signal that is scraped from Wall Street bets.\n\n1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.800\n And now we have that signal as one\n\n1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:28.800\n of our signals in thousands that we use at Numerai.\n\n1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:30.800\n And the structure of the signal is similar,\n\n1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:33.200\n so it's just numbers and time series data.\n\n1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:34.120\n It's exactly.\n\n1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:37.640\n And it's just like, you're providing a ranking of stocks.\n\n1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:41.440\n So you just say, a one means you like the stock,\n\n1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.320\n zero means you don't like the stock,\n\n1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:46.640\n and you provide that for 5,000 stocks in the world.\n\n1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:49.600\n And they somehow converted the natural language\n\n1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:51.880\n that's in the Wall Street bet.\n\n1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:52.760\n Exactly.\n\n1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:55.480\n And they open sourced this Colab notebook.\n\n1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:57.320\n You can go and see it.\n\n1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:00.280\n And so, yeah, it's making a sentiment score.\n\n1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:02.200\n And then turning it into a rank of stocks.\n\n1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:03.160\n A sentiment score.\n\n1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:04.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:07.160\n Like, this stock sucks, or this stock is awesome.\n\n1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:08.000\n And then converting.\n\n1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:08.840\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:11.520\n Just even looking at that data would be fascinating.\n\n1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:15.680\n So on the signal side, what's the vision?\n\n1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:18.240\n This long term, what do you see that becoming?\n\n1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:21.720\n So we want to manage all the money in the world.\n\n1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:23.760\n That's Numerai's mission.\n\n1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:27.400\n And to get that, we need to have all the data\n\n1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:30.200\n and have all of the talent.\n\n1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:32.400\n Like, there's no way, first principles,\n\n1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:35.480\n if you had really good modeling and really good data\n\n1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:37.800\n that you would lose, right?\n\n1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:41.440\n It's just a question of how much do you need to get really good.\n\n1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:43.960\n So Numerai already has some really nice data\n\n1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:45.160\n that we give out.\n\n1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:48.360\n This year, we are 10xing that.\n\n1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:50.600\n And I actually think we'll 10x the amount of data\n\n1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:55.200\n we have on Numerai every year for at least the next 10 years.\n\n1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:55.840\n Wow.\n\n1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:59.080\n So it's going to get very big, the data we give out.\n\n1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:03.640\n And signals is more data.\n\n1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.400\n People with any other random data set\n\n1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.080\n can turn that into a signal and give it to us.\n\n1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:10.560\n And in some sense, that kind of data\n\n1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:12.840\n is the edge cases, the weirdness is the,\n\n1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:16.360\n so you're focused on the bulk, the main data.\n\n1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:18.640\n And then there's just weirdness from all over the place\n\n1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:22.080\n that just can enter through this back door of Numerai signals.\n\n1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:22.640\n Exactly.\n\n1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:26.280\n And it's also a little bit shorter term.\n\n1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:31.160\n So the signals are about a seven day time horizon.\n\n1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:33.920\n And on Numerai, it's like a 30 day.\n\n1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:38.560\n So it's often for faster situations.\n\n1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:40.320\n You've written about a master plan.\n\n1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:43.040\n And you've mentioned, which I love,\n\n1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:46.520\n in a similar sort of style of big style thinking,\n\n1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:52.920\n you would like Numerai to manage all of the world's money.\n\n1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:56.400\n So how do we get there from yesterday\n\n1:05:56.400 --> 1:05:59.480\n to several years from now?\n\n1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:02.040\n Like what is the plan?\n\n1:06:02.040 --> 1:06:06.280\n So you've already started to allure to get all the data\n\n1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:11.760\n and get all the talent, humans, models.\n\n1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:12.680\n Exactly.\n\n1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:14.800\n I mean, the important thing to note there is,\n\n1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:16.080\n what would that mean?\n\n1:06:16.080 --> 1:06:18.000\n And I think the biggest thing it means\n\n1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:22.400\n is if there was one hedge fund, you\n\n1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:26.200\n would have not so much talent wasted\n\n1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:27.760\n on all the other hedge funds.\n\n1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:30.400\n Like it's super weird how the industry works.\n\n1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:34.000\n It's like one hedge fund gets a data source and hires a PhD.\n\n1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.440\n And another hedge fund has to buy the same data source\n\n1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:37.600\n and hire a PhD.\n\n1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:40.000\n And suddenly, a third of American PhDs\n\n1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.280\n are working at hedge funds.\n\n1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:43.680\n And we're not even on Mars.\n\n1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:46.280\n And so in some ways, Numerai, it's\n\n1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:49.760\n all about freeing up people who work at hedge funds\n\n1:06:49.760 --> 1:06:52.480\n to go work for Elon.\n\n1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:53.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:58.200\n And also, the people who are working on Numerai problem,\n\n1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:00.240\n it feels like a lot of the knowledge\n\n1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:02.360\n there is also transferable to other domains.\n\n1:07:02.360 --> 1:07:03.920\n Exactly.\n\n1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:08.080\n One of our top users, he works at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab.\n\n1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:10.000\n And he's amazing.\n\n1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:11.680\n I went to go visit him there.\n\n1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:13.800\n And he's got Numerai posters.\n\n1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:16.560\n And it looks like the movies.\n\n1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:19.320\n It looks like Apollo 11 or whatever.\n\n1:07:19.320 --> 1:07:26.120\n Yeah, the point is he didn't quit his job to join full time.\n\n1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:29.880\n He's working on getting us to Jupiter's moon.\n\n1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.920\n That's his mission, the Europa Klippa mission.\n\n1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:33.520\n Actually, literally what you're saying.\n\n1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:34.200\n Literally.\n\n1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:37.360\n He's smart enough that we really want his intelligence\n\n1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:38.480\n to reach the stock market.\n\n1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:39.600\n Because the stock market's a good thing.\n\n1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:40.800\n Hedge funds are a good thing.\n\n1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:43.040\n All kinds of hedge funds, especially.\n\n1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:45.360\n But we don't want him to quit his job.\n\n1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:47.120\n So he can just do Numerai on the weekends.\n\n1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:47.840\n And that's what he does.\n\n1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:50.400\n He just made a model and it just automatically submits to us.\n\n1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:53.240\n And he's like one of our best users.\n\n1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:57.400\n You mentioned briefly that stock markets are good.\n\n1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:01.920\n From my sort of outsider perspective, is there a sense,\n\n1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:06.880\n do you think trading stocks is closer to gambling?\n\n1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:09.480\n Or is it closer to investing?\n\n1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:14.160\n Sometimes it feels like it's gambling as opposed to betting\n\n1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:15.560\n on companies that succeed.\n\n1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:17.720\n And this is maybe connected to our discussion of shorting\n\n1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:21.000\n in general, but from your sense, the way you think about it,\n\n1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.840\n is it fundamentally still investing?\n\n1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:29.720\n I do think, I mean, it's a good question.\n\n1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:33.480\n I've also seen lately people say, this is like speculation.\n\n1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:35.680\n Is there too much speculation in the market?\n\n1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:38.680\n And it's like, but all the trades are speculative.\n\n1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:40.680\n All the trades have a horizon.\n\n1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:44.040\n People want them to work.\n\n1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:48.800\n So I would say that there's certainly\n\n1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:54.920\n a lot of aspects of gambling math that applies to investing.\n\n1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:57.360\n Like one thing you don't do in gambling\n\n1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:00.400\n is put all your money in one bet.\n\n1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:04.280\n You have bankroll management, and it's a key part of it.\n\n1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:07.600\n And small alterations to your bankroll management\n\n1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:10.680\n might be better than improvements to your skill.\n\n1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:13.520\n And then there are things we care about in our fund.\n\n1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:16.560\n Like we want to make a lot of independent bets.\n\n1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:18.560\n We talk about it, like we want to make\n\n1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:20.560\n a lot of independent bets, because that's\n\n1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:23.400\n going to be a higher sharp than if you have a lot of bets that\n\n1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:25.440\n depend on each other, like all in one sector.\n\n1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:31.320\n But yeah, I mean, the point is that you\n\n1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:39.120\n want the prices of the stocks to be reflective of their value.\n\n1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:40.920\n Of the underlying value of the company.\n\n1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:45.160\n Yeah, you shouldn't have there be like a hedge fund that's\n\n1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:48.160\n able to say, well, I've looked at some data,\n\n1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:51.360\n and all of this stuff's super mispriced.\n\n1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:55.240\n That's super bad for society if it looks like that to someone.\n\n1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:57.600\n I guess the underlying question then\n\n1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:01.800\n is, do you see that the market often drifts away\n\n1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:04.480\n from the underlying value of companies,\n\n1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:06.640\n and it becomes a game in itself?\n\n1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:09.920\n Like with these, whatever they're called,\n\n1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:17.720\n like derivatives, like the options, and shorting,\n\n1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:18.880\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:22.720\n It's like layers of game on top of the actual,\n\n1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:25.120\n like what you said, which is like the basic thing\n\n1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:26.440\n that the Wall Street Bets was doing,\n\n1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:28.680\n which is like just buying stocks.\n\n1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:29.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:31.960\n There are a lot of games that people\n\n1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:36.880\n play that are in the derivatives market.\n\n1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:40.240\n And I think a lot of the stuff people dislike when they look\n\n1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:42.480\n at the history of what's happened,\n\n1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:45.600\n they hate like credit default swaps,\n\n1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:48.040\n or collateralized debt obligations.\n\n1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:52.080\n Like these are the enemies of 2008.\n\n1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:54.760\n And then the long term capital management thing,\n\n1:10:54.760 --> 1:11:00.000\n it was like they had 30 times leverage, or something.\n\n1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.280\n You could just go to a gas station\n\n1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:05.720\n and ask anybody at the gas station,\n\n1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:08.120\n is it a good idea to have 30 times leverage?\n\n1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:09.520\n And they just say no.\n\n1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:12.160\n It's like common sense just like went out the window.\n\n1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:20.520\n So yeah, I don't respect long term capital management.\n\n1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:21.560\n OK.\n\n1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:24.360\n But Numerai doesn't actually use any derivatives\n\n1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:26.840\n unless you call shorting derivative.\n\n1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:29.240\n We just we do put money into companies.\n\n1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:32.240\n And that does help the companies we're investing in.\n\n1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:34.360\n It's just in little ways.\n\n1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:36.360\n We really did buy Tesla.\n\n1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:37.520\n And it did.\n\n1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:44.080\n And we played some role in its success.\n\n1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:46.560\n Super small, make no mistake.\n\n1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:48.160\n But still, I think that's important.\n\n1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:51.200\n Can I ask you a pothead question,\n\n1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:55.720\n which is what is money, man?\n\n1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:59.680\n So if we just kind of zoom out and look at,\n\n1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:02.280\n because I'd love to talk to you about cryptocurrency, which\n\n1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:04.400\n perhaps could be the future of money.\n\n1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:07.720\n In general, how do you think about money?\n\n1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:10.720\n You said Numerai, the vision, the goal\n\n1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:15.480\n is to run, to manage the world's money.\n\n1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:19.440\n What is money in your view?\n\n1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:22.240\n I don't have a good answer to that.\n\n1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:25.200\n But it's definitely in my personal life,\n\n1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:29.200\n it's become more and more warped.\n\n1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:33.280\n And you start to care about the real thing,\n\n1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:37.040\n like what's really going on here.\n\n1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:39.080\n Elon talks about things like this,\n\n1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:40.880\n like what is a company, really?\n\n1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:43.440\n It's a bunch of people who show up to work together\n\n1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:45.480\n and they solve a problem.\n\n1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:47.360\n And there might not be a stock out there\n\n1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:49.920\n that's trading that represents what they're doing,\n\n1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:52.920\n but it's not the real thing.\n\n1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:57.800\n And being involved in crypto, I put\n\n1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:03.440\n in crowdsale of Ethereum and all these other things\n\n1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:06.240\n and different crypto hedge funds and things\n\n1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:07.080\n that I've invested in.\n\n1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:09.840\n And it's just kind of like, it feels\n\n1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:13.040\n like how I used to think about money stuff\n\n1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.960\n is just totally warped.\n\n1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:23.080\n Because you stop caring about the price\n\n1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.040\n and you care about the product.\n\n1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:29.160\n So by the product, you mean the different mechanisms\n\n1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:30.440\n that money is exchanged.\n\n1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:33.520\n I mean, money is ultimately a kind of a little,\n\n1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:36.360\n one is a store of wealth, but it's also\n\n1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:38.640\n a mechanism of exchanging wealth.\n\n1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:42.680\n But what wealth means becomes a totally different thing,\n\n1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:45.960\n especially with cryptocurrency, to where it's almost\n\n1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:48.400\n like these little contracts, these little agreements,\n\n1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:50.440\n these transactions between human beings\n\n1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:56.000\n that represent something that's bigger than just cash being\n\n1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.080\n exchanged at 7.11, it feels like.\n\n1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:58.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:00.280\n Maybe I'll answer what is finance.\n\n1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:06.600\n It's what are you doing when you have the ability\n\n1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:08.760\n to take out a loan?\n\n1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:15.840\n You can bring a whole new future into being with finance.\n\n1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:20.240\n If you couldn't get a student loan to get a college degree,\n\n1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:22.760\n you couldn't get a college degree\n\n1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:23.960\n if you didn't have the money.\n\n1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:29.840\n But now, weirdly, you can get it with, and all you have\n\n1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:32.360\n is this loan, which is like, so now you\n\n1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:34.360\n can bring a different future into the world.\n\n1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:36.960\n And that's how when I was saying earlier about if you rerun\n\n1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.760\n American economic history without these things,\n\n1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:42.560\n like you're not allowed to take out loans,\n\n1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:44.880\n you're not allowed to have derivatives,\n\n1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:47.680\n you're not allowed to have money,\n\n1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:49.000\n it just doesn't really work.\n\n1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.800\n And it's a really magic thing how much\n\n1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:56.040\n you can do with finance by bringing the future forward.\n\n1:14:56.040 --> 1:14:58.080\n Finance is empowering.\n\n1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:01.120\n We sometimes forget this, but it enables innovation.\n\n1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:04.720\n It enables big risk takers and bold builders that ultimately\n\n1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:06.160\n make this world better.\n\n1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:09.800\n You said you were early in on cryptocurrency.\n\n1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:12.120\n Can you give your high level overview\n\n1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:15.400\n of just your thoughts about the past, present, and future\n\n1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:17.760\n of cryptocurrency?\n\n1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:19.880\n Yeah, so my friends told me about Bitcoin,\n\n1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:23.800\n and I was interested in equities a lot.\n\n1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:27.720\n And I was like, well, it has no net present value.\n\n1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:29.960\n It has no future cash flows.\n\n1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:33.080\n Bitcoin pays no dividends.\n\n1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:36.120\n So I really couldn't get my head around it,\n\n1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:39.520\n that this could be valuable.\n\n1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:44.360\n And then I didn't feel like I was early in cryptocurrency,\n\n1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:46.560\n in fact, because it was like 2014.\n\n1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:50.120\n It felt like a long time after Bitcoin.\n\n1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:52.320\n But then I really liked some of the things\n\n1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:54.200\n that Ethereum was doing.\n\n1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:57.120\n It seemed like a super visionary thing.\n\n1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.480\n I was reading something that was just\n\n1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:03.240\n going to change the world when I was reading the white paper.\n\n1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:06.120\n And I liked the different constructs\n\n1:16:06.120 --> 1:16:08.000\n you could have inside of Ethereum\n\n1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.200\n that you couldn't have on Bitcoin.\n\n1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:11.800\n Like smart contracts and all that kind of stuff?\n\n1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:12.640\n Exactly, yeah.\n\n1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:18.880\n And even spoke about different constructions you could have.\n\n1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:21.920\n Yeah, that's a cool dance between Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:23.640\n It's in the space of ideas.\n\n1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:25.240\n It feels so young.\n\n1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:29.360\n Like, I wonder what cryptocurrencies will look like\n\n1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:30.160\n in the future.\n\n1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:33.680\n If Bitcoin or Ethereum 2.0 or some version\n\n1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:35.920\n will stick around or any of those,\n\n1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:37.120\n who's going to win out?\n\n1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:39.880\n Or if there's even a concept of winning out at all?\n\n1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:44.640\n Is there a cryptocurrency that you especially\n\n1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:48.960\n find interesting that technically, financially,\n\n1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:52.200\n philosophically, you think is something\n\n1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:54.080\n you're keeping your eye on?\n\n1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:55.360\n Well, I don't really.\n\n1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:59.200\n I'm not looking to invest in cryptocurrencies anymore.\n\n1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:05.040\n But I mean, and many are almost identical.\n\n1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:09.600\n I mean, there wasn't too much difference\n\n1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:13.520\n between even Ethereum and Bitcoin in some ways, right?\n\n1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:15.880\n But there are some that I like the privacy ones.\n\n1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:19.120\n I mean, I like Zcash for its coolness.\n\n1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:23.640\n It's actually a different kind of invention\n\n1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:25.560\n compared to some of the other things.\n\n1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:29.520\n OK, can you speak just briefly to privacy?\n\n1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:31.200\n Is there some mechanism of preserving\n\n1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:32.680\n some privacy of the universe?\n\n1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:34.720\n So I guess everything is public.\n\n1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:35.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:36.360\n Is that the problem?\n\n1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:40.000\n Yeah, none of the transactions are private.\n\n1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:46.640\n And so I have some numeraire.\n\n1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:48.120\n And you can just see it.\n\n1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:50.040\n In fact, you can go to a website and it says like,\n\n1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:51.520\n you can go to like, etherscan.\n\n1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:54.640\n And it'll say like, numeraire founder.\n\n1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:57.720\n And I'm like, how the hell do you guys know this?\n\n1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.200\n So they can reverse the near, whatever that's called.\n\n1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:02.160\n Yeah, and so they can see me move it, too.\n\n1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:02.920\n They can see me.\n\n1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:04.040\n Oh, why is he moving it?\n\n1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:06.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:10.520\n So but yeah, Zcash.\n\n1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:12.640\n Also, when you can make private transactions,\n\n1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:14.400\n you can also play different games.\n\n1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:15.560\n Yes.\n\n1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:17.840\n And it's unclear.\n\n1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:19.360\n It's like what's quite cool about Zcash\n\n1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:21.640\n is I wonder what games are being played there.\n\n1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:23.040\n No one will know.\n\n1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:27.200\n So from a deeply analytical perspective,\n\n1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:31.200\n can you describe why Dogecoin is going to win?\n\n1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.440\n Which it surely will.\n\n1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:34.960\n Like it very likely will take over the world.\n\n1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:37.360\n And once we expand out into the universe,\n\n1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:40.080\n we'll take over the universe.\n\n1:18:40.080 --> 1:18:42.480\n Or on a more serious note, like what\n\n1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:45.160\n are your thoughts on the recent success of Dogecoin\n\n1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:49.200\n where you've spoken to sort of the meme stocks,\n\n1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:55.240\n the memetics of the whole thing, that it feels like the joke can\n\n1:18:55.240 --> 1:18:58.160\n become the reality.\n\n1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:02.400\n Like the meme, the joke has power in this world.\n\n1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:02.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:04.080\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:05.520\n Exactly.\n\n1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:12.240\n It's like why is it correlated with Elon tweeting about it?\n\n1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:15.040\n It's not just Elon alone tweeting, right?\n\n1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.960\n It's like Elon tweeting and that becomes\n\n1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:22.080\n a catalyst for everybody on the internet kind of like spreading\n\n1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:22.960\n the joke, right?\n\n1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:23.480\n Exactly.\n\n1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:24.200\n The joke of it.\n\n1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:28.560\n So it's the initial spark of the fire for Wall Street\n\n1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:30.520\n bets type of situation.\n\n1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:31.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:33.680\n And that's fascinating because jokes\n\n1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:37.880\n seem to spread faster than other mechanisms.\n\n1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:43.440\n Like funny shit is very effective at captivating\n\n1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:47.160\n the discourse on the internet.\n\n1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:51.520\n Yeah, and I think you can have, like I like the one meme,\n\n1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:54.040\n like Doge, I haven't heard that name in a long time.\n\n1:19:57.760 --> 1:20:00.760\n Like I think back to that meme often.\n\n1:20:00.760 --> 1:20:01.640\n That's like funny.\n\n1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:04.120\n And every time I think back to it,\n\n1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:08.680\n there's a little probability that I might buy it, right?\n\n1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:12.080\n And so imagine you have millions of people who have had\n\n1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:14.400\n all these great jokes, told them,\n\n1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:16.320\n and every now and then they reminisce,\n\n1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:17.840\n oh, that was really funny.\n\n1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:21.960\n And then they're like, let me buy some.\n\n1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:25.440\n Wouldn't that be interesting if we travel in time\n\n1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:28.720\n like multiple centuries where the entirety\n\n1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:33.400\n of the communication of the human species is like humor?\n\n1:20:33.400 --> 1:20:35.480\n Like it's all just jokes.\n\n1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:39.840\n Like we're high on probably some really advanced drugs\n\n1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:42.480\n and we're all just laughing nonstop.\n\n1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:47.320\n It's a weird like dystopian future of just humor.\n\n1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:52.320\n Elon has made me realize how like good it feels\n\n1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:55.400\n to just not take shit seriously every once in a while\n\n1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:58.600\n and just relieve like the pressure of the world.\n\n1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:03.240\n At the same time, the reason I don't always like\n\n1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:06.360\n when people finish their sentences with lol\n\n1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:11.360\n is like when you don't take anything seriously.\n\n1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:13.840\n When everything becomes a joke,\n\n1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:18.840\n then it feels like that way of thinking\n\n1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:22.280\n feels like it will destroy the world.\n\n1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:24.000\n It's like, I often think of like,\n\n1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.880\n will memes save the world or destroy it?\n\n1:21:25.880 --> 1:21:28.560\n Because I think both are possible directions.\n\n1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:30.320\n Yeah, I think this is a big problem.\n\n1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:33.200\n I mean, I always felt that about America,\n\n1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:36.320\n a lot of people are telling jokes kind of all the time\n\n1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:37.800\n and they're kind of good at it.\n\n1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:42.080\n And you take someone aside, an American,\n\n1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:44.240\n you're like, I really wanna have a sincere conversation.\n\n1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:46.760\n It's like hard to even keep a straight face\n\n1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:50.400\n because everything is so, there's so much levity.\n\n1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:51.320\n So it's complicated.\n\n1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:54.920\n I like how sincere actually like your Twitter can be.\n\n1:21:54.920 --> 1:21:57.920\n You're like, I am in love with the world today.\n\n1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:00.640\n I get so much shit for it, it's hilarious.\n\n1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:03.120\n I'm never gonna stop because I realize like,\n\n1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:05.240\n you have to be able to sometimes just be real\n\n1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:09.200\n and be positive and just be, say the cliche things,\n\n1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:11.960\n which ultimately those things actually capture\n\n1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:15.040\n some fundamental truths about life.\n\n1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:16.560\n But it's a dance.\n\n1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:19.640\n And I think Elon does a good job of that\n\n1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:22.960\n from an engineering perspective of being able to joke,\n\n1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:26.800\n but everyone's mostly to pull back and be like,\n\n1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:29.720\n here's real problems, let's solve them and so on.\n\n1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:31.800\n And then be able to jump back to a joke.\n\n1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:36.280\n So it's ultimately, I think, I guess a skill that we\n\n1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:37.120\n have to learn.\n\n1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:41.760\n But I guess your advice is to invest everything\n\n1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:44.640\n anyone listening owns into Dogecoin.\n\n1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:46.120\n That's what I heard from this interaction.\n\n1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:46.960\n Yeah, no, exactly.\n\n1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:50.360\n Yeah, our hedge fund is unavailable.\n\n1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:52.320\n Just go straight to Dogecoin.\n\n1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:55.120\n You're running a successful company.\n\n1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:58.600\n It's just interesting because my mind has been in that space\n\n1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:01.920\n of potentially just being one of the millions of other\n\n1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:03.360\n entrepreneurs.\n\n1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.360\n What's your advice on how to build a successful startup,\n\n1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:10.480\n how to build a successful company?\n\n1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:13.760\n I think that one thing I do like,\n\n1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:16.880\n and it might be a particular thing about America,\n\n1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:20.600\n but there is something about playing,\n\n1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:23.960\n tell people what you really want to happen in the world.\n\n1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:25.400\n Don't stop.\n\n1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:28.720\n It's not gonna make it,\n\n1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:31.080\n like if you're asking someone to invest in your company,\n\n1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:33.720\n don't say, I think maybe one day we might make\n\n1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:34.680\n a million dollars.\n\n1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:38.520\n When you actually believe something else,\n\n1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:41.480\n you actually believe you're actually more optimistic,\n\n1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:45.240\n but you're toning down your optimism because you want\n\n1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:50.080\n to appear like low risk.\n\n1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:53.320\n But actually it's super high risk if your company\n\n1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:56.720\n becomes mediocre because no one wants to work\n\n1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:57.560\n in a mediocre company.\n\n1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:00.000\n No one wants to invest in a mediocre company.\n\n1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.640\n So you should play the real game.\n\n1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:04.480\n And obviously this doesn't apply to all businesses,\n\n1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:07.720\n but if you play a venture backed startup kind of game,\n\n1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:10.520\n like play for keeps, play to win, go big.\n\n1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:13.240\n And it's very hard to do that.\n\n1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:18.200\n I've always feel like, yeah,\n\n1:24:18.200 --> 1:24:22.040\n you can start narrowing your focus because 10 people\n\n1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:26.200\n are telling you, you gotta care about this boring thing\n\n1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:28.000\n that won't matter five years from now.\n\n1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.600\n And you should push back and do the real,\n\n1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:32.440\n play the real game.\n\n1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:33.840\n So be bold.\n\n1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:37.840\n So both, I mean, there's an interesting duality there.\n\n1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:41.080\n So there's the way you speak to other people\n\n1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:45.360\n about like your plans and what you are like privately\n\n1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:48.120\n just in your own mind.\n\n1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:50.160\n And maybe it's connected with what you were saying about,\n\n1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:51.920\n yeah, sincerity as well.\n\n1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:55.800\n Like if you appear to be sincerely optimistic\n\n1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:59.680\n about something that's big or crazy,\n\n1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:01.640\n it's putting yourself up to be kind of like\n\n1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:03.160\n ridiculed or something.\n\n1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:08.000\n And so if you say, my mission is to, yeah, go to Mars,\n\n1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.640\n it's just so bonkers that it's hard to say.\n\n1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:16.520\n It is, but one powerful thing, just like you said,\n\n1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:20.240\n is if you say it and you believe it,\n\n1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:25.240\n then actually amazing people come and work with you.\n\n1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:26.520\n Exactly.\n\n1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:28.800\n It's not just skill, but the dreams.\n\n1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:31.640\n There's something about optimism that,\n\n1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:33.960\n like that fire that you have when you're optimistic\n\n1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:36.200\n of actually having the hope of building\n\n1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:38.960\n something totally cool, something totally new,\n\n1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:41.120\n that when those people get in a room together,\n\n1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:42.840\n like they can actually do it.\n\n1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:43.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:47.480\n Yeah, there's, yeah, that's,\n\n1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:50.800\n and also makes life really fun when you're in that room.\n\n1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:55.080\n So all of that together, ultimately,\n\n1:25:55.080 --> 1:25:57.160\n I don't know, that's what makes this crazy ride\n\n1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:59.640\n of a startup really look fun.\n\n1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:02.520\n And Elon is an example of a person who succeeded at that.\n\n1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:06.040\n There's not many other inspiring figures, which is sad.\n\n1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:11.040\n I used to be at Google and there's something that happens\n\n1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:13.200\n that sometimes when the company grows\n\n1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:14.440\n bigger and bigger and bigger,\n\n1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:18.760\n where that kind of ambition kind of quiets down a little bit.\n\n1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:19.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:21.840\n Google had this ambition, still does,\n\n1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:24.880\n of making the world's information accessible to everyone.\n\n1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:28.320\n And I remember, I don't know, that's beautiful.\n\n1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:33.160\n I still love that dream of that they used to scan books,\n\n1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:34.760\n but just in every way possible\n\n1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:37.480\n make the world's information accessible.\n\n1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:38.640\n Same with Wikipedia.\n\n1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:40.480\n Every time I open up Wikipedia,\n\n1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:45.480\n I'm just awe inspired by how awesome humans are, man.\n\n1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:48.600\n And creating this together,\n\n1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.280\n I don't know what the meanings are over there,\n\n1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:52.720\n but it's just beautiful.\n\n1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:55.200\n Like what they've created is incredible.\n\n1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:58.880\n And I'd love to be able to be part of something like that.\n\n1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:01.800\n And you're right, for that, you have to be bold.\n\n1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:03.480\n And there's, and strange to me also,\n\n1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:04.600\n I think you're right that there's\n\n1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:06.760\n how many boring companies there are.\n\n1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:08.880\n Something I always talk about, especially in FinTech,\n\n1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.400\n it's like, why am I excited about, this is so lame.\n\n1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:16.360\n Like what is, this isn't even important.\n\n1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:19.320\n Even if you succeed, this is gonna be like terrible.\n\n1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:21.040\n This is not good.\n\n1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:23.320\n And it's just strange how people can kind of\n\n1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:27.720\n get fake enthusiastic about like boring ideas\n\n1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:31.680\n when there's so many bigger ideas that,\n\n1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:33.680\n yeah, I mean, you read these things,\n\n1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:35.000\n like this company raises money,\n\n1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.400\n and it's just like, that's a lot of money\n\n1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:38.520\n for the worst idea I've ever heard.\n\n1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:41.440\n Some ideas are really big.\n\n1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:44.520\n So like I worked on autonomous vehicles quite a bit.\n\n1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:48.080\n And there's so many ways in which you can present\n\n1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:50.680\n that idea to yourself, to the team you work with,\n\n1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:53.120\n to just, yeah, like to yourself when you're quietly\n\n1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:55.200\n looking in the mirror in the morning,\n\n1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:58.320\n that's really boring or really exciting.\n\n1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:01.880\n Like if you're really ambitious with autonomous vehicles,\n\n1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:06.320\n it changes the nature of like human robot interaction,\n\n1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:08.160\n it changes the nature of how we move.\n\n1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:09.920\n Forget money, forget all that stuff.\n\n1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:13.240\n It changes like everything about robotics and AI,\n\n1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:16.440\n machine learning, it changes everything about manufacture.\n\n1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:20.080\n I mean, cars, transportation is so fundamentally connected\n\n1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:22.320\n to cars, and if that changes,\n\n1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:24.560\n it's changing the fabric of society,\n\n1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:26.360\n of movies, of everything.\n\n1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:29.560\n And if you go bold and take risks\n\n1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:33.800\n and be willing to go bankrupt with your company,\n\n1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:37.520\n as opposed to cautiously, you can really change the world.\n\n1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:40.560\n And it's so sad for me to see all these autonomous companies,\n\n1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:41.520\n autonomous vehicle companies,\n\n1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:45.160\n they're like really more focused about fundraising\n\n1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:46.400\n and kind of like smoke and mirrors,\n\n1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:48.240\n they're really afraid,\n\n1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:51.760\n the entirety of their marketing is grounded in fear\n\n1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:54.960\n and presenting enough smoke to where they keep raising funds\n\n1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:59.080\n so they can cautiously use technology of a previous decade\n\n1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:02.400\n or previous two decades to kind of test vehicles\n\n1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:04.960\n here and there, as opposed to do crazy things\n\n1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:09.960\n and bold and go huge at scale, do huge data collection.\n\n1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:12.760\n And yeah, so that's just an example.\n\n1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:14.400\n Like the idea can be big,\n\n1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:17.080\n but if you don't allow yourself to take that idea\n\n1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:20.160\n and think really big with it,\n\n1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:22.320\n then you're not gonna make anything happen.\n\n1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:24.200\n Yeah, you're absolutely right in that.\n\n1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:28.880\n So you've been connected in your work\n\n1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:31.280\n with a bunch of amazing people.\n\n1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:34.440\n How much interaction do you have with investors,\n\n1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:36.840\n that whole process is an entire mystery to me.\n\n1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:38.600\n Is there some people that just have influence\n\n1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:42.960\n on the trajectory of your thinking completely,\n\n1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:46.920\n or is it just this collective energy behind the company?\n\n1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:51.920\n Yeah, I mean, I came here and I was amazed how,\n\n1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:54.840\n yeah, people would, I was only here for a few months\n\n1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:57.160\n and I met some incredible investors\n\n1:29:57.160 --> 1:29:59.720\n and I'd almost run out of money.\n\n1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:04.720\n And once they invested, I was like,\n\n1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:06.800\n I am not gonna let you down.\n\n1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:08.280\n And I was like, okay, I'm gonna send them\n\n1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:11.600\n like an email update every like three minutes.\n\n1:30:11.600 --> 1:30:14.160\n And then they don't care at all.\n\n1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:15.720\n So they kind of wanna, I don't know, like,\n\n1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:18.200\n so for some, I like it when it's just like,\n\n1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:20.040\n they're always available to talk,\n\n1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:23.360\n but a lot of building a business,\n\n1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:25.400\n especially a high tech business,\n\n1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:29.240\n there's a little for them to add, right?\n\n1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:31.240\n There's little for them to add on product.\n\n1:30:31.240 --> 1:30:34.320\n There's a lot for them to add on like business development.\n\n1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:36.400\n And if we are doing product research,\n\n1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:39.000\n which is for us research into the market,\n\n1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:41.800\n research into how to make a great hedge fund,\n\n1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:43.360\n and we do that for years,\n\n1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:47.120\n there's not much to tell the investors.\n\n1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:49.040\n So that basically is like, I believe in you.\n\n1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:52.440\n There's something, I like the cut of your jib.\n\n1:30:52.440 --> 1:30:55.760\n There's something in your idea, in your ambition,\n\n1:30:55.760 --> 1:30:57.880\n in your plans that I like.\n\n1:30:57.880 --> 1:30:59.800\n And it's almost like a pat on the back.\n\n1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:01.560\n It's like, go get them kid.\n\n1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:02.720\n Yeah, it is a bit like that.\n\n1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:04.360\n And that's cool.\n\n1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:05.280\n That's a good way to do it.\n\n1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:07.120\n I'm glad they do it that way.\n\n1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:08.800\n Like the one meeting I had,\n\n1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:10.240\n which was like really good with this\n\n1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:12.400\n was meeting Howard Morgan,\n\n1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:16.760\n who's actually a co founder of Renaissance Technologies\n\n1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:21.000\n in the like 1980s and worked with Jim Simons.\n\n1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:25.840\n And he was in the room\n\n1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:28.200\n and I was meeting some other guy and he was in the room\n\n1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:33.000\n and I was explaining how quantitative finance works.\n\n1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:36.600\n I was like, so they use mathematical models.\n\n1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:40.480\n And then he was like, yeah, I started Renaissance.\n\n1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:41.920\n I know a bit about this.\n\n1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:45.080\n And then I was like, oh my God.\n\n1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:50.320\n So yeah, but then, and then I think he kind of said, well,\n\n1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:52.160\n yeah, he said, well, cause I was talking,\n\n1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:55.920\n he was working at first round capital as a partner\n\n1:31:55.920 --> 1:31:58.320\n and they kind of said, they didn't want to invest.\n\n1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:01.920\n And then I wrote a blog post describing the idea\n\n1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:03.640\n and I was like, I really think you guys should invest.\n\n1:32:03.640 --> 1:32:04.560\n And then they end up.\n\n1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:05.760\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:06.600\n You convinced them on that.\n\n1:32:06.600 --> 1:32:07.440\n That must be good.\n\n1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:08.280\n Yeah, cause they're like,\n\n1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:09.120\n we don't really invest in hedge funds.\n\n1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:11.240\n And I was like, you don't see like what I'm doing.\n\n1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:14.400\n This is so a tech company, not a hedge fund, right?\n\n1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:15.800\n Yeah, and Numerai is brilliant.\n\n1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:18.240\n It's, when it caught my eye,\n\n1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:19.240\n there's something special there.\n\n1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:22.720\n So I really do hope you succeed in the,\n\n1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:24.880\n obviously it's a risky thing you're taking on,\n\n1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:26.560\n the ambition of it, the size of it,\n\n1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:28.320\n but I do hope you succeed.\n\n1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:30.400\n You mentioned Jim Simons.\n\n1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:34.520\n He comes up in another world of mine really often on the,\n\n1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:37.720\n he's just a brilliant guy on the mathematics side\n\n1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:38.760\n as a mathematician,\n\n1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:43.760\n but he's also brilliant finance hedge fund manager guy.\n\n1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:47.040\n Have you gotten a chance to interact with him at all?\n\n1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:51.080\n Have you learned anything from him on the math,\n\n1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:54.960\n on the finance, on the philosophy, life side, things?\n\n1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:56.280\n I've played poker with him.\n\n1:32:56.280 --> 1:32:57.120\n It was pretty cool.\n\n1:32:57.120 --> 1:32:59.680\n It was like, actually in the show, Billions,\n\n1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:02.680\n they kind of do a little thing about this poker tournament\n\n1:33:02.680 --> 1:33:04.240\n thing with all the hedge fund managers.\n\n1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:05.680\n And that's real life thing.\n\n1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:09.760\n And they have a lot of like world series of bracelet,\n\n1:33:09.760 --> 1:33:11.800\n world series poker bracelets holders,\n\n1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:13.520\n but it's kind of Jim's thing.\n\n1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:18.520\n And I met him there and yeah, it was kind of brief,\n\n1:33:19.200 --> 1:33:21.480\n but I was just like, he's like, oh, how do you,\n\n1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:22.320\n why are you here?\n\n1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:23.880\n And I was like, oh, Howard sent me, you know,\n\n1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:25.960\n he's like, go play this tournament,\n\n1:33:25.960 --> 1:33:27.800\n meet some of the other players.\n\n1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:29.000\n And then...\n\n1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:30.120\n Was it Texas Holdem?\n\n1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:32.240\n Yeah, Texas Holdem tournament, yeah.\n\n1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:33.800\n Do you play poker yourself or was it?\n\n1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:34.880\n Yeah, I do.\n\n1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:36.440\n I mean, it was crazy.\n\n1:33:36.440 --> 1:33:39.080\n On my right was the CEO,\n\n1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.200\n who's the current CEO of Renaissance, Peter Brown.\n\n1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:47.200\n And Peter Muller, who's a hedge fund manager at PDT.\n\n1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:50.440\n And yeah, I mean, it was just like,\n\n1:33:50.440 --> 1:33:51.760\n and then, you know, just everyone.\n\n1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:53.200\n And then all these bracelet world series,\n\n1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:55.560\n like people that I know from like TV.\n\n1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:00.400\n And Robert Mercer, who's fucking crazy.\n\n1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:02.280\n Who's that?\n\n1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:05.640\n He's the guy who donated the most money to Trump.\n\n1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:09.120\n And he's just like...\n\n1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:10.240\n It's a lot of personality.\n\n1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:12.600\n Character, yeah, geez, it's crazy.\n\n1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:17.600\n So it's quite cool how, yeah, like the, it was really fun.\n\n1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:19.600\n And then I managed to knock out Peter Muller.\n\n1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:22.680\n I have a, I got a little trophy for knocking him out\n\n1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:24.440\n because he was a previous champion.\n\n1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:25.880\n In fact, I think he's won the most.\n\n1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:27.560\n I think he's won three times.\n\n1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:28.600\n Super smart guy.\n\n1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:35.520\n But I will say Jim outlasted me in the tournament.\n\n1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:40.520\n And they're all extremely good at poker,\n\n1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:44.600\n but they're also, so it was a $10,000 buy in.\n\n1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:48.960\n And I was like, this is kind of expensive,\n\n1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:53.560\n but it all goes to charity, Jim's math charity.\n\n1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:58.360\n But then the way they play, they have like rebis\n\n1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:01.080\n and like they all do a shit ton of rebis\n\n1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:02.720\n because it's for charity.\n\n1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:06.240\n So immediately they're like going all in\n\n1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:11.240\n and I'm like, man, like, so I ended up adding more as well.\n\n1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.360\n So it's like you couldn't play at all without doing that.\n\n1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:16.640\n Yeah, the stakes are high.\n\n1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:18.760\n But you're connected to a lot of these folks\n\n1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:23.760\n that are kind of titans of just of economics\n\n1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:27.200\n and tech in general.\n\n1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:28.720\n Do you feel a burden from this?\n\n1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:30.200\n You're a young guy.\n\n1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:33.760\n I did feel a bit out of place there.\n\n1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:35.640\n The company was quite new\n\n1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:39.920\n and they also don't speak about things, right?\n\n1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:44.320\n So it's not like going to meet a famous rocket engineer\n\n1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:46.200\n who will tell you how to make a rocket.\n\n1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:48.040\n They do not want to tell you anything\n\n1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:49.600\n about how to make a hedge fund.\n\n1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:53.000\n It's like all secretive and that part I didn't like.\n\n1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:57.720\n And they were also kind of making fun of me a little bit.\n\n1:35:57.720 --> 1:36:00.600\n Like they would say, like they'd call me like,\n\n1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:02.000\n I don't know, the Bitcoin kid or.\n\n1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:02.840\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:05.280\n And then they would say, even things like,\n\n1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:08.880\n member Peter, yeah, said to me something like,\n\n1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:12.960\n I don't think AI is gonna have a big role in finance.\n\n1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:16.040\n And I was like, hearing this from the CEO of Renaissance\n\n1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:17.960\n was like weird to hear because I was like,\n\n1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:19.080\n of course it will.\n\n1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:21.200\n And he's like, but he can see,\n\n1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:23.400\n I can see it having a really big impact\n\n1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:25.600\n on things like self driving cars.\n\n1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:28.280\n But finance, it's too noisy and whatever.\n\n1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:30.640\n And so I don't think it's like the perfect application.\n\n1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:32.520\n And I was like, that was interesting to hear\n\n1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:35.560\n because it's like, and I think it was that same day\n\n1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:40.560\n that Libra, I think it is, the poker playing AI\n\n1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:42.840\n started to beat like the human.\n\n1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:44.480\n So it was kind of funny hearing them like say,\n\n1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:47.280\n oh, I'm not sure AI could ever attack that problem.\n\n1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:49.360\n And then that very day it's attacking the problem\n\n1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:51.080\n of the game we're playing.\n\n1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:55.720\n Well, there's a kind of a magic to somebody\n\n1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:59.920\n who's exceptionally successful looking at you,\n\n1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:03.560\n giving you respect, but also saying that what you're doing\n\n1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:06.280\n is not going to succeed in a sense.\n\n1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:08.200\n Like they're not really saying it,\n\n1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:11.240\n but I tend to believe from my interactions with people\n\n1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:14.880\n that it's a kind of prod to say like, prove me wrong.\n\n1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:15.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:18.040\n That's ultimately, that's how those guys talk.\n\n1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:20.440\n They see good talent and they're like.\n\n1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:21.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:22.400\n And I think they're also saying\n\n1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:25.880\n it's not gonna succeed quickly in some way.\n\n1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:29.080\n They're like, this is gonna take a long time\n\n1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:32.760\n and maybe that's good to know.\n\n1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:36.320\n And certainly AI in trading,\n\n1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:41.320\n that's one of the most philosophically interesting questions\n\n1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:45.920\n about artificial intelligence and the nature of money.\n\n1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:48.920\n Because it's like, how much can you extract\n\n1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:52.360\n in terms of patterns from all of these millions\n\n1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:57.240\n of humans interacting using this methodology of money?\n\n1:37:57.240 --> 1:37:58.680\n It's like one of the open questions\n\n1:37:58.680 --> 1:37:59.680\n in the artificial intelligence.\n\n1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:02.360\n In that sense, you converting into a data set\n\n1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:07.120\n is one of like the biggest gifts to the research community,\n\n1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:11.080\n to the whole, anyone who loves data science and AI,\n\n1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:14.080\n this is kind of fascinating.\n\n1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:15.680\n I'd love to see where this goes actually.\n\n1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:19.840\n I think I say sometimes long before AGI destroys the world,\n\n1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:21.800\n a narrow intelligence will win all the money\n\n1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:23.240\n in the stock market.\n\n1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:25.440\n Way, like just a narrow AI.\n\n1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:26.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:29.920\n And I don't know if I'm gonna be the one who invents that.\n\n1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:31.960\n So I'm building Numerai to make sure\n\n1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:34.480\n that that narrow AI uses our data.\n\n1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:37.000\n So you're giving a platform\n\n1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.800\n to where millions of people can participate\n\n1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:43.280\n and do build that narrow AI themselves.\n\n1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:45.600\n People love it when I ask this kind of question\n\n1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:50.560\n about books, about ideas and philosophers and so on.\n\n1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:55.560\n I was wondering if you had books or ideas,\n\n1:38:56.760 --> 1:38:59.120\n philosophers, thinkers that had an influence\n\n1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:01.440\n on your life when you were growing up\n\n1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:04.520\n or just today that you would recommend\n\n1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:08.880\n that people check out blog posts, podcasts, videos,\n\n1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:09.720\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:12.080\n Is there something that just kind of had an impact on you\n\n1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:13.760\n that you couldn't recommend?\n\n1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:18.760\n A super kind of obvious one that I really,\n\n1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.240\n I was reading Zero to One while coming up with Numerai.\n\n1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.880\n It was like halfway through the book.\n\n1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:27.160\n And I really do like a lot of the ideas there.\n\n1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:29.360\n And it's also about kind of thinking big\n\n1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:34.360\n and also it's like peculiar little book.\n\n1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:36.400\n It's like why, like there's a little picture\n\n1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:38.800\n of the hipster versus Unabomber.\n\n1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:40.480\n And it's a weird little book.\n\n1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:42.760\n So I like, there's kind of like some depth there.\n\n1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.920\n In terms of a book on a, if you're thinking\n\n1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:47.320\n of doing a startup, that's a good book.\n\n1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:52.320\n A book I like a lot is maybe my favorite book\n\n1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:54.960\n is David Deutsch's Beginning of Infinity.\n\n1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:00.360\n I just found that so optimistic.\n\n1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:03.800\n It puts you, everything you read in science,\n\n1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:06.520\n it like makes the world feel like kind of colder\n\n1:40:06.520 --> 1:40:10.640\n because like it's like we're just coming from evolution\n\n1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:15.200\n and coming from nothing should be this way or whatever.\n\n1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:16.800\n And humans are not very powerful.\n\n1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:19.240\n We're just like scum on the earth.\n\n1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:20.960\n And the way David Deutsch sees things\n\n1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:23.840\n and argues, he argues them with the same rigor\n\n1:40:23.840 --> 1:40:26.200\n that the cynics often use\n\n1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:29.840\n and then has a much better conclusion.\n\n1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:33.480\n That's some of the statements of things like,\n\n1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:35.000\n anything that doesn't violate the laws\n\n1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:39.280\n of physics can be solved.\n\n1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:41.800\n So ultimately arriving at a hopeful,\n\n1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:42.640\n like a hopeful path forward.\n\n1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:45.680\n Yeah, without being like a hippie.\n\n1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:47.640\n You've mentioned kind of advice for startups.\n\n1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:50.600\n Is there, in general, whether you do a startup or not,\n\n1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:52.680\n do you have advice for young people today?\n\n1:40:52.680 --> 1:40:54.160\n You're like an example of somebody\n\n1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:56.240\n who's paved their own path\n\n1:40:56.240 --> 1:40:59.200\n and were, I would say exceptionally successful.\n\n1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:02.800\n Is there advice, somebody who's like 20 today, 18,\n\n1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:05.640\n undergrad or thinking about going to college,\n\n1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:09.520\n or in college and so on that you would give them?\n\n1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:13.560\n I think I often tell young people don't start companies.\n\n1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:16.040\n Is it not, don't start a company\n\n1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:19.120\n unless you're prepared to make it your life's work.\n\n1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:22.480\n Like that's a really good way of putting it.\n\n1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:25.760\n And a lot of people think, well, this semester\n\n1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:27.280\n I'm gonna take a semester off.\n\n1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:28.560\n And in that one semester,\n\n1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:31.240\n I'm gonna start a company and sell it or whatever.\n\n1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:33.360\n And it's just like, what are you talking about?\n\n1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:34.960\n It doesn't really work that way.\n\n1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:37.200\n You should be like super into the idea,\n\n1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:40.640\n so into it that you wanna spend a really long time on it.\n\n1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:44.040\n Is that more about psychology or actual time allocation?\n\n1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:47.560\n Like, is it literally the fact that you need to give 100%\n\n1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.840\n for potentially years for it to succeed?\n\n1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:53.600\n Or is it more about just the mindset that's required?\n\n1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:55.800\n Yeah, I mean, I think, well, any, I think, yeah,\n\n1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:56.640\n you don't wanna have,\n\n1:41:56.640 --> 1:41:59.200\n certainly don't wanna have a plan to sell the company\n\n1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:02.160\n like quickly or something,\n\n1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:05.560\n or it's like a company that has a very,\n\n1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:07.360\n it's like a big fashion component.\n\n1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:08.720\n Like it'll only work now.\n\n1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:10.520\n It's like an app or something.\n\n1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:14.960\n So yeah, that's a big one.\n\n1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:18.880\n And then I also think something I've thought about recently\n\n1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:22.360\n is I had a job as a quant at a fund\n\n1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:25.920\n for about two and a half years.\n\n1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:29.080\n And part of me thinks if I had spent\n\n1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:31.080\n another two years there,\n\n1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:34.360\n I would have learned a lot more\n\n1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:38.480\n and had even more knowledge to be where,\n\n1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:41.160\n to basically accelerate how long Numerai took.\n\n1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:44.720\n So the idea that you can sit in an air conditioned room\n\n1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:46.280\n and get free food,\n\n1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:48.880\n or even sit at home now in your underwear\n\n1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:53.400\n and make a huge amount of money and learn whatever you want\n\n1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:55.080\n and get, it's just crazy.\n\n1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:56.480\n It's such a good deal.\n\n1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:57.920\n Yeah, oh, that's interesting.\n\n1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:00.360\n That's the case for, I was terrified of that.\n\n1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:04.040\n Like at Google, I thought I would become really comfortable\n\n1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:06.160\n in that air conditioned room.\n\n1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:09.760\n And that, I was afraid the quant situation is,\n\n1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:13.280\n I mean, what you present is really brilliant\n\n1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:17.640\n that it's exceptionally valuable, the lessons you learn,\n\n1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:21.120\n because you get to get paid while you learn from others.\n\n1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:24.160\n If you see that, if you see jobs\n\n1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:27.800\n in the space of your passion that way,\n\n1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:29.360\n that it's just an education.\n\n1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:31.400\n It's like the best kind of education.\n\n1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:34.200\n But of course you have, from my perspective,\n\n1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:37.320\n you have to be really careful on that to get comfortable.\n\n1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:39.760\n Again, in a relationship, then you buy a house\n\n1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:42.720\n or whatever the hell it is, and then you get,\n\n1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:44.200\n and then you convince yourself like,\n\n1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:46.640\n well, I have to pay these fees for the car,\n\n1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:48.240\n for the house, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:50.360\n And then there's momentum and all of a sudden\n\n1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:53.080\n you're on your death bed and there's grandchildren\n\n1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:55.160\n and you're drinking whiskey\n\n1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:56.960\n and complaining about kids these days.\n\n1:43:56.960 --> 1:44:00.800\n So I'm afraid of that momentum, but you're right.\n\n1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:04.120\n Like there's something special about the education\n\n1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:06.320\n you get working at these companies.\n\n1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:08.200\n Yeah, and I remember on my desk,\n\n1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:11.320\n I had like a bunch of papers on quant finance,\n\n1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:13.280\n a bunch of papers on optimization,\n\n1:44:13.280 --> 1:44:16.680\n and then the paper on Ethereum, just on my desk as well,\n\n1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:19.280\n and the white paper, and it's like,\n\n1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:23.680\n it's been amazing how kind of, and you can learn about,\n\n1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:25.680\n so that, I also thought, I think this idea\n\n1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:28.440\n of like learning about intersections of things,\n\n1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:30.240\n I don't think there are too many people that know\n\n1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:33.640\n like as much about crypto and quant finance\n\n1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:36.280\n and machine learning as I do.\n\n1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:39.280\n And that's a really nice set of three things\n\n1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:40.640\n to know stuff about.\n\n1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:43.320\n And that was because I had like free time in my job.\n\n1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:48.640\n Okay, let me ask the perfectly impractical,\n\n1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:49.840\n but the most important question.\n\n1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:53.760\n What's the meaning of all the things you're trying to do\n\n1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:56.200\n so many amazing things, why?\n\n1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:00.800\n What's the meaning of this life of yours or ours?\n\n1:45:00.800 --> 1:45:01.840\n I don't know.\n\n1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:03.400\n Humans.\n\n1:45:03.400 --> 1:45:06.300\n Yeah, so I have yet had some people say,\n\n1:45:06.300 --> 1:45:07.760\n asking what meaning of life is,\n\n1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:10.160\n is like asking the wrong question or something.\n\n1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:11.160\n The question is wrong.\n\n1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:12.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.640\n No, usually people get too nervous to be able to say that\n\n1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:16.520\n because it's like your question sucks.\n\n1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:18.800\n I don't think there's an answer.\n\n1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:21.120\n It's like the searching for it.\n\n1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:22.880\n It's like sometimes asking it.\n\n1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:25.560\n It's like sometimes sitting back and looking up at the stars\n\n1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:29.800\n and being like, huh, I wonder if there's aliens up there.\n\n1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:34.800\n There's a useful like a palette cleanser aspect to it\n\n1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:39.600\n because it kind of wakes you up to like all the little busy,\n\n1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:42.680\n hurried day to day activities, all the meetings,\n\n1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:45.220\n all the things you'd like a part of.\n\n1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:47.640\n We're just like ants, a part of a system,\n\n1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:48.920\n a part of another system.\n\n1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:52.120\n And then asking this bigger question\n\n1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:53.920\n allows you to kind of zoom out and think about it.\n\n1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:55.240\n But there's ultimately,\n\n1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:58.880\n I think it's an impossible thing for a limited capacity,\n\n1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:01.520\n like cognitive capacity to capture.\n\n1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:03.040\n But it's fun to listen to somebody\n\n1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:07.240\n who's exceptionally successful, exceptionally busy now,\n\n1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:09.800\n who's also young like you,\n\n1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:14.640\n to ask these kinds of questions about like death.\n\n1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:18.280\n You know, do you consider your own mortality kind of thing\n\n1:46:18.280 --> 1:46:21.760\n and life, whether that enters your mind?\n\n1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:23.240\n Because it often doesn't,\n\n1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:24.920\n it kind of almost gets in the way.\n\n1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:26.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:26.260 --> 1:46:28.840\n It's amazing how many things you can like that are trivial\n\n1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:31.280\n that could occupy a lot of your mind\n\n1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:36.280\n until something bad happens or something flips you.\n\n1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:38.480\n And then you start thinking about the people you love\n\n1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:39.760\n that are in your life.\n\n1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:41.080\n Then you started thinking about like,\n\n1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:42.840\n holy shit, this ride ends.\n\n1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:43.960\n Exactly.\n\n1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:48.960\n Yeah, I just had COVID and I had it quite bad.\n\n1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:51.720\n What wasn't really bad is just like,\n\n1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:55.720\n I also got a simultaneous like lung infection.\n\n1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:59.280\n So I had like almost like bronchitis or whatever.\n\n1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:01.960\n I don't even, I don't understand that stuff,\n\n1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:06.280\n but I started, and then you're forced to be isolated.\n\n1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:07.120\n Right.\n\n1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:08.880\n And so it's actually kind of nice\n\n1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:12.440\n because it's very depressing.\n\n1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:15.800\n And then I've heard stories of, I think it's Sean Parker.\n\n1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:18.240\n He had like all these diseases as a child\n\n1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:20.640\n and he had to like just stay in bed for years.\n\n1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:22.280\n And then he like made Napster.\n\n1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:24.840\n It's like pretty cool.\n\n1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:27.680\n So yeah, I had about 15 days of this recently,\n\n1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:28.520\n just last month.\n\n1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:30.400\n And it feels like it did shock me\n\n1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:34.640\n into a new kind of energy and ambition.\n\n1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:37.960\n Were there moments when you were just like terrified\n\n1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:39.680\n at the combination of loneliness?\n\n1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:43.120\n And like, you know, the thing about COVID is like,\n\n1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:45.480\n there's some degree of uncertainty.\n\n1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:48.400\n Like it feels like it's a new thing, a new monster\n\n1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:50.920\n that's arrived on this earth.\n\n1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:54.280\n And so, you know, dealing with it alone,\n\n1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:55.680\n a lot of people are dying.\n\n1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:57.240\n It's like wondering like.\n\n1:47:57.240 --> 1:47:59.200\n Yeah, you do wonder, I mean, for sure.\n\n1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:03.160\n And then there are the even new strains in South Africa,\n\n1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:04.000\n which is where I was.\n\n1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.920\n And maybe the new strain had some interaction\n\n1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:09.520\n with my genes and I'm just gonna die.\n\n1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:11.440\n But ultimately it was liberating somehow.\n\n1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:12.600\n I loved it.\n\n1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:15.440\n Oh, I loved that I got out of it.\n\n1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:16.280\n Okay.\n\n1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:17.120\n Because it also affects your mind.\n\n1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:18.680\n You get confused, you get confusion\n\n1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:21.360\n and kind of a lot of fatigue\n\n1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:23.360\n and you can't do your usual tricks\n\n1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:24.800\n of psyching yourself out of it.\n\n1:48:24.800 --> 1:48:27.440\n So, you know, sometimes it's like, oh man, I feel tired.\n\n1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:29.720\n Okay, I'm just gonna go have coffee and then I'll be fine.\n\n1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:31.440\n It's like, now it's like, I feel tired.\n\n1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:33.440\n I don't even wanna get out of bed to get coffee\n\n1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:34.680\n because I feel so tired.\n\n1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:37.120\n And then you have to confront,\n\n1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:40.840\n there's no like quick fix cure and you're trapped at home.\n\n1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:43.320\n But that, so now you have this little thing\n\n1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:44.920\n that happened to you that was a reminder\n\n1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:48.160\n that you're mortal and you get to carry that flag\n\n1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:53.160\n in trying to create something special in this world.\n\n1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:54.120\n Right?\n\n1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:54.960\n With Numerai.\n\n1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:58.320\n Listen, this was like one of my favorite conversation\n\n1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:03.280\n because the way you think about this world of money\n\n1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:05.200\n and just this world in general is so clear\n\n1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:08.680\n and you're able to explain it so eloquently.\n\n1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:09.960\n Richard, that was really fun.\n\n1:49:09.960 -->
