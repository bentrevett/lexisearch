So like the Army, the Navy has,\n\n02:12.980 --> 02:14.780\n all the different organizations\n\n02:14.780 --> 02:16.740\n have their own intelligence groups.\n\n02:16.740 --> 02:19.740\n So is there clear lines here to be drawn,\n\n02:19.740 --> 02:23.180\n or is the CIA the giant integrator of all of these?\n\n02:23.180 --> 02:24.540\n It's a little bit of both, to be honest.\n\n02:24.540 --> 02:26.280\n So yes, there are absolutely lines,\n\n02:26.280 --> 02:28.340\n and more so than the lines.\n\n02:28.340 --> 02:30.960\n There are lines that divide what our primary mission is.\n\n02:30.960 --> 02:32.740\n Everything's gotta be prioritized.\n\n02:32.740 --> 02:34.060\n That's one of the benefits\n\n02:34.060 --> 02:36.100\n and the superpowers of the United States,\n\n02:36.100 --> 02:38.620\n is we prioritize everything.\n\n02:38.620 --> 02:41.080\n So different intelligence organizations are prioritized\n\n02:41.080 --> 02:43.540\n to collect certain types of intelligence.\n\n02:43.540 --> 02:47.100\n And then within the confines of how they collect,\n\n02:47.100 --> 02:49.340\n they're also given unique authorities,\n\n02:49.340 --> 02:51.500\n authorities are a term that's directed\n\n02:51.500 --> 02:53.460\n by the executive branch.\n\n02:53.460 --> 02:55.500\n Different agencies have different authorities\n\n02:55.500 --> 02:58.620\n to execute missions in different ways.\n\n02:58.620 --> 03:01.220\n FBI can't execute the same way CIA executes,\n\n03:01.220 --> 03:05.480\n and CIA can't execute the same way NGA executes.\n\n03:05.480 --> 03:08.900\n But then at the end, excuse me, when it's all collected,\n\n03:08.900 --> 03:13.900\n then yes, CIA still acts as a final synthesizing repository\n\n03:15.080 --> 03:17.700\n to create what's known as the president's daily brief,\n\n03:17.700 --> 03:20.760\n the PDB, the only way CIA can create the PDB\n\n03:20.760 --> 03:24.860\n is by being the single source of all source intelligence\n\n03:24.860 --> 03:28.380\n from around the IC, the intelligence community,\n\n03:28.380 --> 03:33.380\n which are those 30 some odd and always changing organizations\n\n03:33.500 --> 03:35.980\n that are sponsored for intelligence operations.\n\n03:35.980 --> 03:38.900\n What is the PDB, the president's daily brief look like?\n\n03:38.900 --> 03:39.740\n How long is it?\n\n03:39.740 --> 03:41.580\n What does it contain?\n\n03:41.580 --> 03:43.940\n So first of all, it looks like the most expensive\n\n03:43.940 --> 03:45.300\n book report you can ever imagine.\n\n03:45.300 --> 03:46.820\n It's got its own binder.\n\n03:46.820 --> 03:48.980\n It's all very high end.\n\n03:48.980 --> 03:51.100\n It feels important, it looks important.\n\n03:51.100 --> 03:53.220\n It's not like a cheap trapper keeper.\n\n03:54.220 --> 03:56.780\n It's somewhere between, I would give it probably\n\n03:56.780 --> 03:59.340\n between 50 and 125 pages a day.\n\n03:59.340 --> 04:02.500\n It's produced every day around two o clock in the morning\n\n04:02.500 --> 04:04.500\n by a dedicated group of analysts.\n\n04:04.500 --> 04:09.500\n And each page is essentially a short paragraph\n\n04:09.880 --> 04:13.400\n to a few paragraphs about a priority happening\n\n04:13.400 --> 04:16.500\n that affects national security from around the world.\n\n04:16.500 --> 04:19.660\n The president rarely gets to the entire briefing in a day.\n\n04:19.660 --> 04:22.780\n He relies on a briefer instead to prioritize\n\n04:22.780 --> 04:25.060\n what inside the briefing needs to be shared\n\n04:25.060 --> 04:25.900\n with the president.\n\n04:25.900 --> 04:28.600\n Because some days the PDB will get briefed in 10 minutes\n\n04:28.600 --> 04:30.560\n and some days it'll be briefed over the course of two hours.\n\n04:30.560 --> 04:32.820\n It depends on the president's schedule.\n\n04:32.820 --> 04:36.220\n How much competition is there for the first page?\n\n04:36.220 --> 04:39.660\n And so how much jockeying there is for attention?\n\n04:41.080 --> 04:44.500\n I imagine for all the different intelligence agencies\n\n04:44.500 --> 04:46.980\n and within the CIA there's probably different groups\n\n04:46.980 --> 04:50.680\n that are modular and they all care about different nations\n\n04:50.680 --> 04:53.380\n or different cases.\n\n04:54.740 --> 04:58.660\n Do you understand how much competition there is\n\n04:58.660 --> 05:00.600\n for the attention, for the limited attention\n\n05:00.600 --> 05:01.480\n of the president?\n\n05:01.480 --> 05:05.300\n You're 100% correct in how the agency\n\n05:05.300 --> 05:09.620\n and how officers and managers at the agency handle the PDB.\n\n05:09.620 --> 05:10.940\n There's a ton of competition.\n\n05:10.940 --> 05:12.660\n Everybody wants to be the first on the radar.\n\n05:12.660 --> 05:14.360\n Everybody wants to be on the first page.\n\n05:14.360 --> 05:17.240\n The thing that we're not baking into the equation\n\n05:17.240 --> 05:19.140\n is the president's interests.\n\n05:19.140 --> 05:21.460\n The president dictates what's on the first page of his PDB\n\n05:21.460 --> 05:23.780\n and he will tell them usually the day before,\n\n05:23.780 --> 05:25.420\n I wanna see this on the first page tomorrow.\n\n05:25.420 --> 05:26.580\n Bring this to me in the beginning.\n\n05:26.580 --> 05:28.700\n I don't wanna hear about what's happening in Mozambique.\n\n05:28.700 --> 05:30.880\n I don't really care about what's happening in Saudi Arabia.\n\n05:30.880 --> 05:32.820\n I wanna see one, two, three.\n\n05:32.820 --> 05:34.220\n And regardless of whether or not\n\n05:34.220 --> 05:37.020\n those are the three biggest things in the world,\n\n05:37.020 --> 05:39.300\n the president's the executive, he's the one.\n\n05:39.300 --> 05:40.660\n He's the ultimate customer.\n\n05:40.660 --> 05:42.580\n So we do what the customer says.\n\n05:42.580 --> 05:44.620\n That has backfired in the past.\n\n05:44.620 --> 05:46.500\n If you haven't already started seeing\n\n05:46.500 --> 05:49.240\n how that could go wrong, that has backfired in the past,\n\n05:49.240 --> 05:51.200\n but that is essentially what happens\n\n05:51.200 --> 05:53.320\n when you serve in the executive branch.\n\n05:53.320 --> 05:55.080\n You serve the executive.\n\n05:55.080 --> 05:58.060\n So what's the role of the director of the CIA\n\n05:58.060 --> 05:59.800\n versus the president?\n\n05:59.800 --> 06:01.280\n What's that dance like?\n\n06:01.280 --> 06:06.060\n So the president really leads the focus of the CIA?\n\n06:06.060 --> 06:09.320\n The president is the commander in chief for the military,\n\n06:09.320 --> 06:12.660\n but the president is also the executive\n\n06:12.660 --> 06:16.220\n for the entirety of the intelligence community.\n\n06:16.220 --> 06:19.540\n So he's the ultimate customer.\n\n06:19.540 --> 06:21.940\n If you look at it like a business,\n\n06:21.940 --> 06:24.300\n the customer, the person spending the money\n\n06:24.300 --> 06:27.500\n is the president and the director is the CEO.\n\n06:27.500 --> 06:30.600\n So if the director doesn't create what the president wants,\n\n06:30.600 --> 06:31.620\n there's gonna be a new director.\n\n06:31.620 --> 06:32.900\n That's why the director of CIA\n\n06:32.900 --> 06:34.560\n is a presidential appointed position.\n\n06:34.560 --> 06:36.240\n Sometimes they're extremely qualified\n\n06:36.240 --> 06:37.620\n intelligence professionals.\n\n06:37.620 --> 06:39.600\n Sometimes they're just professional politicians\n\n06:39.600 --> 06:41.500\n or soldiers that get put into that seat\n\n06:41.500 --> 06:43.800\n because the president trusts them\n\n06:43.800 --> 06:46.740\n to do what he wants them to do.\n\n06:46.740 --> 06:51.740\n Another gaping area that causes problems,\n\n06:52.380 --> 06:54.240\n but that's still the way it is.\n\n06:54.240 --> 06:57.260\n So you think this is a problematic configuration\n\n06:57.260 --> 06:58.100\n of the whole system?\n\n06:58.100 --> 06:59.460\n Massive flaw in the system.\n\n06:59.460 --> 07:00.860\n It is a massive flaw in the system\n\n07:00.860 --> 07:03.860\n because if you're essentially appointing a director\n\n07:03.860 --> 07:05.500\n to do what you want them to do,\n\n07:05.500 --> 07:08.580\n then you're assigning a crony.\n\n07:08.580 --> 07:10.820\n And that's what we define corruption as\n\n07:10.820 --> 07:11.660\n within the United States.\n\n07:11.660 --> 07:12.660\n And inside the United States,\n\n07:12.660 --> 07:15.020\n we say if you pick somebody outside of merit\n\n07:15.020 --> 07:16.660\n for any other reason other than merit,\n\n07:16.660 --> 07:19.500\n then it's cronyism or it's nepotism.\n\n07:19.500 --> 07:21.720\n Here, that's exactly what our structure is built on.\n\n07:21.720 --> 07:22.900\n All presidential appointees\n\n07:22.900 --> 07:25.060\n are appointed on something other than merit.\n\n07:25.060 --> 07:27.460\n So for an intelligence agency to be effective,\n\n07:27.460 --> 07:31.740\n it has to discover the truth and communicate that truth.\n\n07:31.740 --> 07:34.700\n And maybe if you're appointing the director of that agency,\n\n07:34.700 --> 07:37.780\n you're not, they're less likely to communicate the truth\n\n07:37.780 --> 07:39.980\n to you unless the truth aligns perfectly\n\n07:39.980 --> 07:41.740\n with your desired worldview.\n\n07:41.740 --> 07:43.080\n Well, not necessarily perfectly\n\n07:43.080 --> 07:44.840\n because there are other steps, right?\n\n07:44.840 --> 07:46.900\n They have to be, they have to go in front of Congress\n\n07:46.900 --> 07:48.440\n and they have to have the support\n\n07:48.440 --> 07:51.940\n of multiple legislatures or legislators,\n\n07:51.940 --> 07:55.800\n but the challenge is that the shortlist of people\n\n07:55.800 --> 07:59.280\n who even get the opportunity aren't a meritorious list.\n\n07:59.280 --> 08:01.540\n It's a shortlist based off of who the president is picking\n\n08:01.540 --> 08:03.340\n or who the would be president is picking.\n\n08:03.340 --> 08:05.100\n Now, I think we've proven\n\n08:05.100 --> 08:07.680\n that an intelligence organization can be,\n\n08:07.680 --> 08:10.580\n an intelligence organization can be extremely effective\n\n08:10.580 --> 08:13.300\n even within the flawed system.\n\n08:13.300 --> 08:16.300\n The challenge is how much more effective could we be\n\n08:16.300 --> 08:17.740\n if we improved?\n\n08:17.740 --> 08:20.180\n And that's, I think that's the challenge\n\n08:20.180 --> 08:21.940\n that faces a lot of the US government.\n\n08:21.940 --> 08:24.860\n I think that's a challenge that has resulted\n\n08:24.860 --> 08:28.540\n in what we see today when it comes to the decline\n\n08:28.540 --> 08:31.140\n of American power and American influence,\n\n08:31.140 --> 08:35.420\n the rise of foreign influence, authoritarian powers,\n\n08:35.420 --> 08:39.460\n and a shrinking US economy, a growing Chinese economy.\n\n08:39.460 --> 08:42.420\n And it's just, we have questions, hard questions\n\n08:42.420 --> 08:43.340\n we need to ask ourselves\n\n08:43.340 --> 08:45.200\n about how we're gonna handle the future.\n\n08:45.200 --> 08:47.820\n What aspect of that communication between the president\n\n08:47.820 --> 08:52.820\n and the CIA could be fixed to help fix the problems\n\n08:53.420 --> 08:54.540\n that you're referring to\n\n08:54.540 --> 08:57.580\n in terms of the decline of American power?\n\n08:57.580 --> 09:02.580\n So when you talk about the president wanting to prioritize\n\n09:02.600 --> 09:04.600\n what the president cares about,\n\n09:04.600 --> 09:07.540\n that immediately shows a break\n\n09:07.540 --> 09:09.700\n between what actually matters\n\n09:09.700 --> 09:12.320\n to the longterm success of the United States\n\n09:12.320 --> 09:13.300\n versus what happened,\n\n09:13.300 --> 09:15.540\n what benefits the short term success\n\n09:15.540 --> 09:16.500\n of the current president.\n\n09:16.500 --> 09:20.160\n Because any president is just a human being\n\n09:20.160 --> 09:21.900\n and has a very narrow focus.\n\n09:21.900 --> 09:24.720\n And narrow focus is not a longterm calculation.\n\n09:24.720 --> 09:26.660\n Exactly, what's the maximum amount of years\n\n09:26.660 --> 09:28.300\n the president can be president?\n\n09:28.300 --> 09:29.260\n Eight.\n\n09:29.260 --> 09:30.620\n He has to be, he or she.\n\n09:30.620 --> 09:31.620\n In the United States.\n\n09:31.620 --> 09:32.700\n In the United States,\n\n09:32.700 --> 09:34.340\n according to our current constitution.\n\n09:34.340 --> 09:35.180\n Yeah.\n\n09:35.180 --> 09:39.340\n But they're very limited\n\n09:39.340 --> 09:41.600\n in terms of what they have to prioritize.\n\n09:41.600 --> 09:44.060\n And then if you look at a four year cycle,\n\n09:44.060 --> 09:45.740\n two years of that is essentially preparing\n\n09:45.740 --> 09:47.120\n for the next election cycle.\n\n09:47.120 --> 09:49.160\n So that's only two years of really quality attention\n\n09:49.160 --> 09:50.060\n you get from the president,\n\n09:50.060 --> 09:51.500\n who is the chief executive\n\n09:51.500 --> 09:53.100\n of all the intelligence community.\n\n09:53.100 --> 09:55.220\n So the most important thing to them\n\n09:55.220 --> 09:57.020\n is not always the most important thing\n\n09:57.020 --> 09:59.660\n to the longterm survival of the United States.\n\n09:59.660 --> 10:02.020\n What do you make of the hostile relationship\n\n10:02.020 --> 10:04.680\n that to me at least stands out of the presidents\n\n10:04.680 --> 10:07.320\n between Donald Trump and the CIA?\n\n10:07.320 --> 10:11.460\n Was that a very kind of personal bickering?\n\n10:11.460 --> 10:13.280\n I mean, is there something interesting to you\n\n10:13.280 --> 10:16.300\n about the dynamics between that particular president\n\n10:16.300 --> 10:17.980\n and that particular instantiation\n\n10:17.980 --> 10:19.380\n of the intelligence agency?\n\n10:19.380 --> 10:21.720\n Man, there were lots of things fascinating to me\n\n10:21.720 --> 10:23.700\n about that relationship.\n\n10:23.700 --> 10:26.140\n What's the good and the bad, sorry to interrupt.\n\n10:26.140 --> 10:27.980\n So let me start with the good first\n\n10:27.980 --> 10:28.820\n because there's a lot of people\n\n10:28.820 --> 10:30.940\n who don't think there was any good.\n\n10:30.940 --> 10:35.740\n So the good thing is we saw that the president\n\n10:35.740 --> 10:40.380\n who's the chief customer, the executive to the CIA,\n\n10:40.380 --> 10:42.520\n when the president doesn't want to hear\n\n10:42.520 --> 10:45.520\n what CIA has to say, he's not gonna listen.\n\n10:45.520 --> 10:46.580\n I think that's an important lesson\n\n10:46.580 --> 10:49.140\n for everyone to take home.\n\n10:49.140 --> 10:51.620\n If the president doesn't care what you have to say,\n\n10:51.620 --> 10:52.820\n he's gonna take funding away\n\n10:52.820 --> 10:54.660\n or she will take funding away.\n\n10:54.660 --> 10:56.260\n They're gonna take attention away.\n\n10:56.260 --> 11:01.260\n They're going to shut down your operations, your missions.\n\n11:02.600 --> 11:04.780\n They're gonna kill the careers of the people working there.\n\n11:04.780 --> 11:05.940\n Think about that, for the four years\n\n11:05.940 --> 11:08.500\n that President Trump was the president,\n\n11:08.500 --> 11:12.000\n basically everybody at CIA, their career was put on pause.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.660\n Some people's careers were ended.\n\n11:13.660 --> 11:16.300\n Some people voluntarily left their career there\n\n11:16.300 --> 11:20.380\n because they found themselves working for a single customer\n\n11:20.380 --> 11:21.940\n that didn't want what they had to produce.\n\n11:21.940 --> 11:24.500\n So for people who don't know,\n\n11:24.500 --> 11:26.980\n Donald Trump did not display significant,\n\n11:26.980 --> 11:28.860\n deep interest in the output.\n\n11:29.820 --> 11:30.900\n He did not trust it, yeah.\n\n11:30.900 --> 11:32.460\n He was a disinterested customer.\n\n11:32.460 --> 11:33.300\n Exactly right.\n\n11:33.300 --> 11:34.420\n Of the information.\n\n11:34.420 --> 11:37.020\n And then what do disinterested customers do?\n\n11:37.020 --> 11:39.740\n They go find someone else to create their product.\n\n11:39.740 --> 11:41.180\n And that's exactly what Donald Trump did.\n\n11:41.180 --> 11:43.340\n And he did it through the private intelligence world,\n\n11:43.340 --> 11:45.540\n funding private intelligence companies\n\n11:45.540 --> 11:48.120\n to run their own operations that brought him\n\n11:48.120 --> 11:50.960\n the information he cared about when CIA wouldn't.\n\n11:50.960 --> 11:52.700\n It also didn't help that CIA\n\n11:52.700 --> 11:54.580\n stepped outside of their confines, right?\n\n11:54.580 --> 11:56.660\n CIA is supposed to collect foreign intelligence\n\n11:56.660 --> 11:58.740\n and not comment on domestic matters.\n\n11:58.740 --> 12:00.420\n They went way outside of that\n\n12:00.420 --> 12:02.380\n when they started challenging the president,\n\n12:02.380 --> 12:04.180\n when they started questioning the results,\n\n12:04.180 --> 12:08.340\n when they started publicly claiming Russian influence.\n\n12:08.340 --> 12:10.780\n That's all something the FBI could have handled by itself.\n\n12:10.780 --> 12:12.560\n The Justice Department could have handled by itself.\n\n12:12.560 --> 12:16.340\n CIA had no place to contribute to that conversation.\n\n12:16.340 --> 12:18.800\n And when they did, all they did was undermine\n\n12:18.800 --> 12:21.700\n the relationship they had with their primary customer.\n\n12:21.700 --> 12:26.240\n Let me sort of focus in on this relationship\n\n12:26.240 --> 12:29.120\n between the president or the leader\n\n12:29.120 --> 12:31.100\n and the intelligence agency\n\n12:31.100 --> 12:33.120\n and look outside the United States.\n\n12:34.100 --> 12:36.500\n It seems like authoritarian regimes\n\n12:36.500 --> 12:37.860\n or regimes throughout history,\n\n12:37.860 --> 12:39.780\n if you look at Stalin and Hitler,\n\n12:39.780 --> 12:41.820\n if you look at today with Vladimir Putin,\n\n12:42.700 --> 12:44.420\n the negative effects of power\n\n12:44.420 --> 12:46.460\n corrupting the mind of a leader\n\n12:46.460 --> 12:50.340\n manifest itself is that they start\n\n12:50.340 --> 12:53.420\n to get bad information from the intelligence agencies.\n\n12:53.420 --> 12:55.660\n So this kind of thing that you're talking about,\n\n12:55.660 --> 12:58.660\n over time, they start hearing information\n\n12:58.660 --> 13:00.760\n they want to hear.\n\n13:00.760 --> 13:02.220\n The agency starts producing\n\n13:02.220 --> 13:05.620\n only the kind of information they want to hear,\n\n13:05.620 --> 13:09.900\n and the leader's worldview starts becoming distorted\n\n13:09.900 --> 13:13.860\n to where the propaganda they generate\n\n13:13.860 --> 13:17.260\n is also the thing that the intelligence agencies\n\n13:17.260 --> 13:19.740\n provide to them, and so they start getting this,\n\n13:19.740 --> 13:21.580\n they start believing their own propaganda,\n\n13:21.580 --> 13:23.760\n and they start getting a distorted view of the world.\n\n13:23.760 --> 13:27.460\n Sorry for the sort of walking through in a weird way,\n\n13:27.460 --> 13:29.820\n but I guess I want to ask, do you think,\n\n13:29.820 --> 13:32.620\n let's look at Vladimir Putin specifically.\n\n13:32.620 --> 13:37.620\n Do you think he's getting accurate information\n\n13:37.780 --> 13:38.620\n about the world?\n\n13:38.620 --> 13:40.820\n Do you think he knows the truth of the world,\n\n13:40.820 --> 13:42.640\n whether that's the war in Ukraine,\n\n13:42.640 --> 13:45.140\n whether that's the behavior of the other nations,\n\n13:45.140 --> 13:47.460\n in NATO, the United States in general?\n\n13:47.460 --> 13:49.060\n What do you think?\n\n13:49.060 --> 13:52.580\n It's rare that I'll talk about just thinking.\n\n13:52.580 --> 13:55.420\n I prefer to share my assessment,\n\n13:55.420 --> 13:56.980\n why I assess things a certain way,\n\n13:56.980 --> 13:59.580\n rather than just what's my random opinion.\n\n13:59.580 --> 14:02.940\n In my assessment, Vladimir Putin is winning.\n\n14:02.940 --> 14:04.140\n Russia is winning.\n\n14:04.140 --> 14:06.980\n They're winning in Ukraine, but they're also winning\n\n14:06.980 --> 14:08.820\n the battle of influence against the West.\n\n14:08.820 --> 14:11.160\n They're winning in the face of economic sanctions.\n\n14:11.160 --> 14:12.340\n They're winning.\n\n14:12.340 --> 14:15.460\n Empirically, when you look at the math, they're winning.\n\n14:15.460 --> 14:18.140\n So when you ask me whether or not Putin\n\n14:18.140 --> 14:20.540\n is getting good information from his intelligence services,\n\n14:20.540 --> 14:24.460\n when I look at my overall assessment of multiple data points,\n\n14:24.460 --> 14:26.920\n he must be getting good information.\n\n14:26.920 --> 14:28.540\n Do I know how or why?\n\n14:28.540 --> 14:29.700\n I do not.\n\n14:29.700 --> 14:31.220\n I don't know how or why it works there.\n\n14:31.220 --> 14:35.020\n I don't know how such deep cronyism,\n\n14:35.020 --> 14:40.020\n such deep corruption can possibly yield true real results.\n\n14:40.020 --> 14:42.600\n And yet, somehow there are real results happening.\n\n14:42.600 --> 14:46.160\n So it's either excessive waste and an accidental win,\n\n14:46.160 --> 14:48.280\n or there really is a system and a process there\n\n14:48.280 --> 14:49.360\n that's functioning.\n\n14:49.360 --> 14:51.760\n So this winning idea is very interesting.\n\n14:51.760 --> 14:55.400\n In what way, short term and long term, is Russia winning?\n\n14:55.400 --> 14:57.160\n Some people say there was a miscalculation\n\n14:57.160 --> 14:58.920\n of the way the invasion happened.\n\n14:59.800 --> 15:02.520\n There was an assumption that you would be able\n\n15:02.520 --> 15:05.000\n to successfully take Kiev.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.880\n You'd be able to successfully capture the East,\n\n15:07.880 --> 15:10.720\n the South, and the North of Ukraine.\n\n15:10.720 --> 15:14.120\n And with what now appears to be\n\n15:14.120 --> 15:16.360\n significantly insufficient troops\n\n15:16.360 --> 15:19.920\n spread way too thin across way too large of a front.\n\n15:20.880 --> 15:23.680\n So that seems to be like an intelligence failure.\n\n15:25.480 --> 15:28.720\n And that doesn't seem to be like winning.\n\n15:28.720 --> 15:30.760\n In another way, it doesn't seem like winning\n\n15:30.760 --> 15:33.840\n if we put aside the human cost of war.\n\n15:33.840 --> 15:36.280\n It doesn't seem like winning\n\n15:36.280 --> 15:39.600\n because the hearts and minds of the West\n\n15:40.720 --> 15:43.260\n were completely on the side of Ukraine.\n\n15:43.260 --> 15:46.120\n This particular leader, Volodymyr Zelensky,\n\n15:46.120 --> 15:48.080\n captured the attention of the world\n\n15:48.080 --> 15:52.120\n and the hearts and minds of Europe, the West,\n\n15:52.120 --> 15:54.460\n and many other nations throughout the world,\n\n15:54.460 --> 15:57.360\n both financially, in terms of military equipment,\n\n15:57.360 --> 16:01.460\n and in terms of sort of social and cultural\n\n16:01.460 --> 16:04.760\n and emotional support for the independence fight\n\n16:04.760 --> 16:05.880\n of this nation.\n\n16:05.880 --> 16:08.720\n That seems to be like a miscalculation.\n\n16:08.720 --> 16:12.120\n So against that pushback,\n\n16:12.120 --> 16:15.840\n why do you think there's still kernels\n\n16:15.840 --> 16:19.920\n of winning in this on the Russian side?\n\n16:19.920 --> 16:21.920\n What you're laying out isn't incorrect.\n\n16:21.920 --> 16:26.320\n And the miscalculations are not unexpected.\n\n16:26.320 --> 16:28.960\n Anybody who's been to a military college,\n\n16:28.960 --> 16:30.700\n including the Army War College in Pennsylvania,\n\n16:30.700 --> 16:34.880\n where so many of our military leaders are brought up,\n\n16:34.880 --> 16:37.920\n when you look at the conflict in Ukraine,\n\n16:37.920 --> 16:40.400\n it fits the exact mold\n\n16:40.400 --> 16:44.840\n of what an effective longterm military conflict,\n\n16:44.840 --> 16:46.200\n protracted military conflict,\n\n16:46.200 --> 16:49.600\n would and should look like for military dominance.\n\n16:49.600 --> 16:52.420\n Now, did Zelensky and did the Ukrainians\n\n16:52.420 --> 16:53.260\n shock the world?\n\n16:53.260 --> 16:54.240\n Absolutely.\n\n16:54.240 --> 16:57.800\n But in that, they also shocked American intelligence,\n\n16:57.800 --> 17:00.200\n which, like you said, miscalculated.\n\n17:00.200 --> 17:01.560\n The whole world miscalculated\n\n17:01.560 --> 17:03.200\n how the Ukrainians would respond.\n\n17:03.200 --> 17:05.560\n Putin did not move in there accidentally.\n\n17:05.560 --> 17:06.800\n He had an assessment.\n\n17:06.800 --> 17:09.400\n He had high likelihood of a certain outcome,\n\n17:09.400 --> 17:11.440\n and that outcome did not happen.\n\n17:11.440 --> 17:13.120\n Why did he have that calculation?\n\n17:13.120 --> 17:15.980\n Because in 2014, it worked.\n\n17:15.980 --> 17:19.760\n He invaded, he took Crimea in 14 days.\n\n17:19.760 --> 17:24.760\n He basically created an infiltration campaign\n\n17:25.080 --> 17:26.880\n that turned key leaders over\n\n17:26.880 --> 17:29.240\n in the first few days of the conflict.\n\n17:29.240 --> 17:30.720\n So essentially, there was no conflict.\n\n17:30.720 --> 17:33.240\n It worked in 2008 when he took Georgia.\n\n17:33.240 --> 17:35.040\n Nobody talks about that.\n\n17:35.040 --> 17:38.340\n He invaded Georgia the exact same way, and it worked.\n\n17:38.340 --> 17:39.400\n So in 2008, it worked.\n\n17:39.400 --> 17:40.360\n In 2014, it worked.\n\n17:40.360 --> 17:43.180\n There was no reason to believe it wasn't going to work again.\n\n17:43.180 --> 17:45.520\n So he just carried out the same campaign.\n\n17:45.520 --> 17:47.600\n But this time, something was different.\n\n17:47.600 --> 17:51.100\n That was a miscalculation for sure on the part of Putin.\n\n17:51.100 --> 17:53.000\n And the reason that there was no support from the West,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.440\n because let's not forget, there is no support.\n\n17:55.440 --> 17:58.680\n There is nothing other than the Lend Lease Act,\n\n17:58.680 --> 18:01.880\n which is putting Ukraine in massive debt right now\n\n18:01.880 --> 18:03.340\n to the West.\n\n18:03.340 --> 18:05.200\n That's the only form of support they're getting\n\n18:05.200 --> 18:07.080\n from NATO or the United States.\n\n18:08.220 --> 18:10.840\n So if somebody believed Ukraine would win,\n\n18:10.840 --> 18:12.280\n if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance,\n\n18:12.280 --> 18:13.680\n they would have gotten more material support\n\n18:13.680 --> 18:15.520\n than just debt.\n\n18:15.520 --> 18:17.780\n And we can jump into that anytime you want to.\n\n18:17.780 --> 18:19.480\n But the whole world miscalculated.\n\n18:19.480 --> 18:21.440\n Everybody thought Russia was going to win in 14 days.\n\n18:21.440 --> 18:23.560\n I said that they would win in 14 days\n\n18:23.560 --> 18:26.360\n because that was the predominant calculation.\n\n18:26.360 --> 18:28.960\n Once the first invasion didn't work,\n\n18:28.960 --> 18:32.760\n then the military does what professional militaries do, man.\n\n18:32.760 --> 18:37.760\n They reevaluate, they reorganize leaders,\n\n18:38.080 --> 18:40.340\n and then they take a new approach.\n\n18:40.340 --> 18:41.720\n You saw three approaches.\n\n18:41.720 --> 18:43.720\n The first two did not work.\n\n18:43.720 --> 18:46.240\n The first two campaigns against Ukraine did not work\n\n18:46.240 --> 18:47.680\n the way they were supposed to work.\n\n18:47.680 --> 18:51.280\n The third has worked exactly like it's supposed to work.\n\n18:51.280 --> 18:53.780\n You don't need Kiev to win Ukraine.\n\n18:53.780 --> 18:56.560\n You don't need hearts and minds to win Ukraine.\n\n18:56.560 --> 19:00.800\n What you need is control of natural resources,\n\n19:00.800 --> 19:02.680\n which they're taking in the East,\n\n19:02.680 --> 19:05.880\n and you need access to the heartbeat,\n\n19:05.880 --> 19:09.120\n the blood flow of food and money into the country,\n\n19:09.120 --> 19:10.900\n which they're taking in the South.\n\n19:10.900 --> 19:14.760\n The fact that Ukraine had to go to the negotiation table\n\n19:14.760 --> 19:19.400\n with Russia and Turkey in order to get exports\n\n19:19.400 --> 19:21.760\n out of the Black Sea approved again\n\n19:21.760 --> 19:24.180\n demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing.\n\n19:25.240 --> 19:29.500\n The aggressor had a seat at the negotiation table\n\n19:29.500 --> 19:32.400\n to allow Ukraine the ability to even export\n\n19:32.400 --> 19:33.880\n one of its top exports.\n\n19:33.880 --> 19:35.480\n If Russia would have said no,\n\n19:35.480 --> 19:37.120\n then they would not have had that.\n\n19:37.120 --> 19:39.640\n Russia has, that's like someone holding your throat.\n\n19:39.640 --> 19:43.200\n It's like somebody holding your jugular vein and saying,\n\n19:43.200 --> 19:46.480\n if you don't do what I tell you to do,\n\n19:46.480 --> 19:48.340\n then I'm not gonna let you breathe.\n\n19:48.340 --> 19:50.080\n I'm not gonna let blood flow to your brain.\n\n19:50.080 --> 19:52.880\n So do you think it's possible that Russia\n\n19:52.880 --> 19:56.140\n takes the South of Ukraine?\n\n19:56.140 --> 20:01.140\n It takes, so starting from Mariupol, the Kherson region.\n\n20:03.620 --> 20:04.520\n All the way to Odessa.\n\n20:04.520 --> 20:05.760\n All the way to Odessa.\n\n20:05.760 --> 20:09.720\n And into Moldova.\n\n20:09.720 --> 20:12.880\n I believe all of that will happen before the fall.\n\n20:12.880 --> 20:13.800\n Fall of this year?\n\n20:13.800 --> 20:14.680\n Fall of this year.\n\n20:14.680 --> 20:16.600\n Before winter hits Europe,\n\n20:16.600 --> 20:21.480\n NATO wants Germany needs to be able to have sanctions lifted\n\n20:21.480 --> 20:23.720\n so they can tap into Russian power.\n\n20:23.720 --> 20:26.100\n There's no way they can have those sanctions lifted\n\n20:26.100 --> 20:28.240\n unless Russia wins.\n\n20:28.240 --> 20:31.240\n And Russia also knows that all of Europe,\n\n20:31.240 --> 20:33.380\n all of NATO is the true,\n\n20:33.380 --> 20:36.000\n the true people feeling the pain of the war\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:39.160\n outside of Ukraine are the NATO countries\n\n20:39.160 --> 20:42.680\n because they're so heavily reliant on Russia.\n\n20:42.680 --> 20:46.280\n And as they have supported American sanctions against Russia,\n\n20:46.280 --> 20:47.880\n their people feel the pain.\n\n20:47.880 --> 20:50.520\n Economically, their people feel the pain.\n\n20:50.520 --> 20:51.940\n What are they gonna do in the winter?\n\n20:51.940 --> 20:54.700\n Because without Russian gas,\n\n20:54.700 --> 20:56.840\n their people are gonna freeze to death.\n\n20:56.840 --> 20:58.000\n Ukrainian people.\n\n20:58.000 --> 20:59.280\n People all over NATO.\n\n21:00.440 --> 21:03.040\n Ukraine, everybody knows Ukraine's at risk.\n\n21:03.040 --> 21:05.200\n Everybody knows Ukrainians are dying.\n\n21:05.200 --> 21:08.560\n The game of war isn't played just,\n\n21:08.560 --> 21:10.220\n it isn't even played majoritively\n\n21:10.220 --> 21:11.920\n by the people who are fighting.\n\n21:11.920 --> 21:13.640\n The game of war is played by everyone else.\n\n21:13.640 --> 21:14.640\n It's an economic game.\n\n21:14.640 --> 21:16.020\n It's not a military game.\n\n21:16.020 --> 21:18.400\n The flow of resources and energy.\n\n21:18.400 --> 21:19.600\n Attention. And food.\n\n21:19.600 --> 21:21.400\n Exactly right.\n\n21:21.400 --> 21:24.640\n I was on the front in the Kherson region,\n\n21:24.640 --> 21:26.880\n the very area that you're referring to,\n\n21:26.880 --> 21:29.040\n and I spoke to a lot of people,\n\n21:29.040 --> 21:33.240\n and the morale is incredibly high.\n\n21:33.240 --> 21:37.700\n And I don't think the people in that region,\n\n21:37.700 --> 21:42.700\n soldiers, volunteer soldiers, civilians,\n\n21:42.700 --> 21:47.340\n are going to give up that land without dying.\n\n21:47.340 --> 21:48.700\n I agree with you.\n\n21:48.700 --> 21:51.980\n I mean, in order to take Odessa,\n\n21:51.980 --> 21:56.980\n would require huge amount of artillery\n\n21:57.520 --> 22:00.380\n and slaughter of civilians, essentially.\n\n22:00.380 --> 22:01.860\n They're not gonna use artillery in Odessa\n\n22:01.860 --> 22:05.400\n because Odessa's too important to Russian culture.\n\n22:06.300 --> 22:07.880\n It's gonna be even uglier than that.\n\n22:07.880 --> 22:10.340\n It's going to be clearing of streets,\n\n22:10.340 --> 22:13.420\n clearing of buildings, person by person, troop by troop.\n\n22:13.420 --> 22:16.100\n It'll be a lot like what it was in Margol.\n\n22:16.100 --> 22:18.140\n Just shooting at civilians.\n\n22:18.140 --> 22:20.940\n Because they can't afford to just do bombing raids\n\n22:20.940 --> 22:23.100\n because they're gonna destroy cultural,\n\n22:23.100 --> 22:25.500\n significant architecture that's just too important\n\n22:25.500 --> 22:26.700\n to the Russian culture,\n\n22:26.700 --> 22:29.500\n and that's gonna demoralize their own Russian people.\n\n22:29.500 --> 22:30.580\n I have to do a lot of thinking\n\n22:30.580 --> 22:32.620\n to try to understand what I even feel.\n\n22:32.620 --> 22:37.460\n I don't know, but in terms of information,\n\n22:37.460 --> 22:39.380\n the thing that the soldiers are saying,\n\n22:39.380 --> 22:40.740\n the Russian soldiers are saying,\n\n22:40.740 --> 22:43.620\n the thing the Russian soldiers really believe\n\n22:43.620 --> 22:45.420\n is that they're freeing,\n\n22:45.420 --> 22:50.420\n they're liberating the Ukrainian people from Nazis.\n\n22:54.100 --> 22:55.420\n And they believe this.\n\n22:56.560 --> 22:57.820\n Because I visited Ukraine,\n\n22:57.820 --> 23:00.740\n I spoke to over 100,\n\n23:00.740 --> 23:02.540\n probably a couple hundred Ukrainian people\n\n23:02.540 --> 23:04.420\n from different walks of life.\n\n23:04.420 --> 23:08.620\n It feels like the Russian soldiers, at least,\n\n23:08.620 --> 23:11.220\n are under a cloud of propaganda.\n\n23:11.220 --> 23:15.500\n They're not operating on a clear view of the whole world.\n\n23:15.500 --> 23:20.500\n And given all that,\n\n23:20.500 --> 23:25.500\n I just don't see Russia taking the South\n\n23:28.100 --> 23:31.740\n without committing war crimes.\n\n23:32.740 --> 23:36.460\n And if Vladimir Putin is aware of what's happening\n\n23:36.460 --> 23:39.380\n in terms of the treatment of civilians,\n\n23:39.380 --> 23:43.100\n I don't see him pushing forward all the way\n\n23:43.100 --> 23:44.740\n to take the South,\n\n23:44.740 --> 23:49.740\n because that's not going to be effective strategy\n\n23:49.740 --> 23:54.020\n for him to win the hearts and minds of these people.\n\n23:54.020 --> 23:56.740\n Autocracies don't need to win hearts and minds.\n\n23:56.740 --> 24:00.140\n That's a staunchly democratic point of view.\n\n24:00.140 --> 24:02.020\n Hearts and minds mean very little\n\n24:02.020 --> 24:07.020\n to people who understand core basic needs and true power.\n\n24:11.940 --> 24:13.700\n You don't see Xi Jinping worrying\n\n24:13.700 --> 24:14.900\n about hearts and minds in China.\n\n24:14.900 --> 24:17.580\n You don't see it in North Korea.\n\n24:17.580 --> 24:20.100\n You don't see it in Congo.\n\n24:20.100 --> 24:22.420\n You don't see it in most of the world.\n\n24:22.420 --> 24:24.620\n Hearts and minds are a luxury.\n\n24:24.620 --> 24:27.260\n In reality, what people need is food, water, power.\n\n24:27.260 --> 24:32.260\n They need income to be able to secure a lifestyle.\n\n24:32.700 --> 24:34.060\n It is absolutely sad.\n\n24:34.060 --> 24:37.620\n I am not in any way, shape or form saying\n\n24:37.620 --> 24:42.420\n that my assessment on this is enriching\n\n24:42.420 --> 24:46.340\n or enlightening or hopeful.\n\n24:46.340 --> 24:48.700\n It's just fact.\n\n24:48.700 --> 24:52.660\n It's just calculatable empirical evidence.\n\n24:52.660 --> 24:56.300\n If Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses,\n\n24:56.300 --> 24:59.420\n the influential losses, the economic losses,\n\n24:59.420 --> 25:03.740\n the lives lost, the power lost is too great.\n\n25:03.740 --> 25:07.540\n So it is better for him to push and push and push\n\n25:07.540 --> 25:09.380\n through war crimes, through everything else.\n\n25:09.380 --> 25:10.620\n War crimes are something defined\n\n25:10.620 --> 25:12.380\n by the international court system.\n\n25:12.380 --> 25:14.620\n The international court system has Russia\n\n25:14.620 --> 25:16.220\n as part of its board.\n\n25:16.220 --> 25:19.700\n And the international court system is largely powerless\n\n25:20.860 --> 25:23.180\n when it comes to enforcing its own outcomes.\n\n25:23.180 --> 25:26.180\n So the real risk gain scenario here\n\n25:26.180 --> 25:31.180\n for Russia is significantly in favor of gain over risk.\n\n25:34.340 --> 25:36.260\n The other thing that I think is important\n\n25:36.260 --> 25:39.980\n to talk about is we, everybody is trapped\n\n25:39.980 --> 25:42.860\n in the middle of a gigantic information war.\n\n25:42.860 --> 25:46.020\n Yes, there's battlefield bullets and cannons and tanks,\n\n25:46.020 --> 25:48.540\n but there's also a massive informational war.\n\n25:48.540 --> 25:53.540\n The same narrative that you see these ground troops\n\n25:53.540 --> 25:56.780\n in Ukraine, these Russian ground troops in Ukraine,\n\n25:56.780 --> 25:59.780\n believing they're clearing the land of Nazis.\n\n25:59.780 --> 26:02.540\n That information is being fed to them\n\n26:02.540 --> 26:04.100\n from their own home country.\n\n26:05.020 --> 26:06.460\n I don't know why people seem to think\n\n26:06.460 --> 26:08.100\n that the information that they're reading in English\n\n26:08.100 --> 26:09.780\n is any more or less true.\n\n26:10.900 --> 26:13.020\n Every piece of news coming out of the West,\n\n26:13.020 --> 26:14.820\n every piece of information coming out\n\n26:14.820 --> 26:18.420\n in the English language is also a giant narrative\n\n26:18.420 --> 26:23.420\n being shared intentionally to try to undermine the morale\n\n26:23.620 --> 26:26.060\n and the faithfulness of English speaking Russians,\n\n26:26.060 --> 26:27.900\n which somebody somewhere knows exactly\n\n26:27.900 --> 26:29.540\n how many of those there are.\n\n26:29.540 --> 26:32.020\n So we have to recognize that we're not getting\n\n26:32.020 --> 26:33.820\n true information from other side\n\n26:33.820 --> 26:35.980\n because there's a strategic value in making sure\n\n26:35.980 --> 26:37.900\n that there is just the right amount\n\n26:37.900 --> 26:40.300\n of mis or disinformation out there.\n\n26:40.300 --> 26:42.540\n Not because someone's trying to lie to Americans,\n\n26:42.540 --> 26:44.420\n but because someone is trying to influence\n\n26:44.420 --> 26:47.060\n the way English speaking Russians think.\n\n26:47.060 --> 26:49.860\n And in that world, that's exactly why you see\n\n26:49.860 --> 26:54.420\n so many news articles cited to anonymous sources,\n\n26:54.420 --> 26:56.580\n government officials who do not wanna be named.\n\n26:56.580 --> 26:59.780\n There's nothing that links back responsibility there.\n\n26:59.780 --> 27:02.020\n There's nothing that can go to court there,\n\n27:02.020 --> 27:04.180\n but the information still gets released.\n\n27:04.180 --> 27:08.260\n And that's enough to make Ukrainians believe\n\n27:08.260 --> 27:10.060\n that the United States is gonna help them\n\n27:10.060 --> 27:11.300\n or that the West is gonna help them.\n\n27:11.300 --> 27:13.100\n It's enough to make Russians think\n\n27:13.100 --> 27:15.540\n that they're going to lose.\n\n27:15.540 --> 27:18.060\n And maybe they should just give up now\n\n27:18.060 --> 27:19.700\n and leave from the battlefield now.\n\n27:19.700 --> 27:20.940\n We have to understand.\n\n27:20.940 --> 27:24.060\n We are in the middle of a giant information war.\n\n27:24.060 --> 27:25.420\n Maybe you can correct me,\n\n27:25.420 --> 27:27.380\n but it feels like in the English speaking world,\n\n27:27.380 --> 27:29.420\n it's harder to control.\n\n27:29.420 --> 27:32.300\n It's harder to fight the information war\n\n27:32.300 --> 27:36.060\n because of, some people say there's not really\n\n27:36.060 --> 27:37.580\n a freedom of speech in this country,\n\n27:37.580 --> 27:40.180\n but I think if you compare,\n\n27:40.180 --> 27:41.780\n there's a lot more freedom of speech.\n\n27:41.780 --> 27:44.300\n And it's just harder to control narratives\n\n27:44.300 --> 27:48.460\n when there's a bunch of guerrilla journalists\n\n27:48.460 --> 27:50.380\n that are able to just publish anything they want\n\n27:50.380 --> 27:51.980\n on Twitter or anything.\n\n27:51.980 --> 27:53.940\n It's just harder to control narratives.\n\n27:53.940 --> 27:56.100\n So people don't understand what freedom of speech is.\n\n27:56.100 --> 27:57.580\n That's the first major problem.\n\n27:57.580 --> 28:00.340\n And it's shameful how many people in the United States\n\n28:00.340 --> 28:03.740\n do not understand what freedom of speech actually protects.\n\n28:03.740 --> 28:06.580\n So that aside, you're absolutely right.\n\n28:06.580 --> 28:09.140\n Fighting the information war in the West\n\n28:09.140 --> 28:10.380\n is extremely difficult\n\n28:10.380 --> 28:15.380\n because anyone with a blog, anyone with a Twitter account,\n\n28:16.100 --> 28:18.260\n anyone, I mean, anyone can call themselves\n\n28:18.260 --> 28:19.540\n a journalist, essentially.\n\n28:19.540 --> 28:21.740\n We live in a world, we live in a country\n\n28:21.740 --> 28:23.260\n where people read the headline\n\n28:23.260 --> 28:26.580\n and they completely bypass the author line\n\n28:26.580 --> 28:28.220\n and they go straight into the content.\n\n28:28.220 --> 28:30.140\n And then they decide whether the content's real or not\n\n28:30.140 --> 28:31.420\n based on how they feel\n\n28:31.420 --> 28:33.980\n instead of based on empirical, measurable evidence.\n\n28:35.140 --> 28:37.580\n So you mentioned the Lend Lease Act\n\n28:37.580 --> 28:39.740\n and the support of the United States,\n\n28:39.740 --> 28:42.340\n support of Ukraine by the United States.\n\n28:42.340 --> 28:44.700\n Are you skeptical to the level of support\n\n28:44.700 --> 28:46.820\n that the United States is providing\n\n28:46.820 --> 28:49.980\n and is going to provide over time?\n\n28:49.980 --> 28:51.620\n The strategy that the United States has taken\n\n28:51.620 --> 28:54.140\n to support Ukraine is similar to the strategy we took\n\n28:54.140 --> 28:56.340\n to support Great Britain during World War II.\n\n28:57.460 --> 28:58.660\n The enactment of the Lend Lease Act\n\n28:58.660 --> 28:59.980\n is a perfect example of that.\n\n28:59.980 --> 29:02.620\n The Lend Lease Act means that we are lending\n\n29:02.620 --> 29:06.020\n or leasing equipment to the Ukrainian government\n\n29:06.020 --> 29:07.900\n in exchange for future payment.\n\n29:07.900 --> 29:09.940\n So every time a rocket is launched,\n\n29:09.940 --> 29:12.260\n every time a drone crashes into a tank,\n\n29:12.260 --> 29:17.260\n that's a bill that Ukraine is just racking up.\n\n29:17.820 --> 29:18.820\n It's like when you go to a restaurant\n\n29:18.820 --> 29:20.300\n and you start drinking shots.\n\n29:20.300 --> 29:22.700\n Sometime the bill will come due.\n\n29:22.700 --> 29:25.460\n This is exactly what we did when Europe\n\n29:25.460 --> 29:29.340\n and when Great Britain was in the face of a Nazi invasion.\n\n29:29.340 --> 29:31.260\n We signed the same thing into motion.\n\n29:31.260 --> 29:34.260\n Do you know that the UK did not pay off the debt\n\n29:34.260 --> 29:37.140\n from World War II until 2020?\n\n29:37.140 --> 29:41.300\n They've been paying that debt since the end of World War II.\n\n29:41.300 --> 29:44.620\n So what we're doing is we're indebting Ukraine\n\n29:44.620 --> 29:46.780\n against the promise that perhaps\n\n29:46.780 --> 29:48.140\n they will secure their freedom,\n\n29:48.140 --> 29:49.700\n which nobody seems to wanna talk about\n\n29:49.700 --> 29:52.340\n what freedom is actually gonna look like for Ukrainians.\n\n29:52.340 --> 29:54.900\n What are the true handful of outcomes,\n\n29:54.900 --> 29:56.700\n the realistic outcomes that could come of this\n\n29:56.700 --> 29:59.620\n and which of those outcomes really looks like freedom\n\n29:59.620 --> 30:02.060\n to them, especially in the face of the fact\n\n30:02.060 --> 30:04.860\n that they're going to be trillions of dollars in debt\n\n30:04.860 --> 30:08.940\n to the West for supplying them with the training\n\n30:08.940 --> 30:10.900\n and the weapons and the food and the med kits\n\n30:10.900 --> 30:12.300\n and everything else that we're giving them\n\n30:12.300 --> 30:13.980\n because none of it's free.\n\n30:13.980 --> 30:16.100\n It's all coming due.\n\n30:16.100 --> 30:19.900\n We're a democracy, but we're also a capitalist country.\n\n30:19.900 --> 30:22.700\n We can't afford to just give things away for free,\n\n30:22.700 --> 30:24.340\n but we can give things away at a discount.\n\n30:24.340 --> 30:26.540\n We can give things away, lay away,\n\n30:26.540 --> 30:28.380\n but the bill will come due.\n\n30:28.380 --> 30:30.980\n And unfortunately that is not part of the conversation\n\n30:30.980 --> 30:32.420\n that's being had with the American people.\n\n30:32.420 --> 30:36.900\n So debt is a way to establish some level of control.\n\n30:36.900 --> 30:39.260\n Power is power.\n\n30:39.260 --> 30:43.660\n That said, having a very close relationship\n\n30:43.660 --> 30:44.940\n between Ukraine and the United States\n\n30:44.940 --> 30:49.940\n does not seem to be a negative possibility\n\n30:50.620 --> 30:52.500\n when the Ukrainians think about their future\n\n30:52.500 --> 30:53.540\n in terms of freedom.\n\n30:53.540 --> 30:54.380\n That's one thing.\n\n30:54.380 --> 30:57.340\n And the other, there's some aspect of this war\n\n30:57.340 --> 31:01.020\n that I've just noticed that one of the people I talked to\n\n31:01.020 --> 31:06.020\n said that all great nations have a independence war,\n\n31:08.140 --> 31:10.140\n have to have a war for their independence.\n\n31:10.140 --> 31:12.220\n In order, there's something, it's dark,\n\n31:12.220 --> 31:16.220\n but there's something about war just being a catalyst\n\n31:16.220 --> 31:18.860\n for finding your own identity as a nation.\n\n31:18.860 --> 31:21.540\n So you can have leaders, you can have sort of\n\n31:21.540 --> 31:23.780\n signed documents, you can have all this kind of stuff,\n\n31:23.780 --> 31:24.940\n but there's something about war\n\n31:24.940 --> 31:26.820\n that really brings the country together\n\n31:26.820 --> 31:29.860\n and actually try to figure out what is at the core\n\n31:29.860 --> 31:32.820\n of the spirit of the people that defines this country.\n\n31:32.820 --> 31:36.540\n And they see this war as that,\n\n31:36.540 --> 31:38.500\n as the independence war to define the heart\n\n31:38.500 --> 31:39.340\n of what the country is.\n\n31:39.340 --> 31:42.860\n So there's been before the war, before this invasion,\n\n31:43.780 --> 31:46.300\n there was a lot of factions in the country.\n\n31:46.300 --> 31:50.420\n There was a lot of influence from oligarchs\n\n31:50.420 --> 31:51.940\n and corruption and so on.\n\n31:51.940 --> 31:56.180\n A lot of that was the factions were brought together\n\n31:56.180 --> 31:59.980\n under one umbrella effectively to become one nation\n\n31:59.980 --> 32:01.420\n because of this invasion.\n\n32:01.420 --> 32:04.740\n So they see that as a positive direction\n\n32:04.740 --> 32:09.740\n for the defining of what a free democratic country\n\n32:10.300 --> 32:12.020\n looks like after the war,\n\n32:12.020 --> 32:14.740\n in their perspective after the war is won.\n\n32:14.740 --> 32:19.220\n It's a difficult situation because I'm trying to make sure\n\n32:19.220 --> 32:22.140\n that you and all, everybody listening understands\n\n32:22.140 --> 32:25.420\n that what's happening in Ukraine, among Ukrainians,\n\n32:25.420 --> 32:29.140\n is noble and brave and courageous\n\n32:29.140 --> 32:33.220\n and beyond the expectations of anyone.\n\n32:35.500 --> 32:38.860\n The fact is there is no material support\n\n32:38.860 --> 32:40.100\n coming from the outside.\n\n32:40.100 --> 32:43.020\n The American Revolution was won\n\n32:43.020 --> 32:44.620\n because of French involvement.\n\n32:44.620 --> 32:47.900\n French ships, French troops, French generals,\n\n32:47.900 --> 32:49.700\n French military might.\n\n32:49.700 --> 32:55.500\n The independence of communist China was won\n\n32:55.500 --> 32:57.740\n through Russian support, Russian generals,\n\n32:57.740 --> 33:01.020\n Russian troops on the ground fighting with the communists.\n\n33:01.020 --> 33:03.660\n That's how revolutions are won.\n\n33:03.660 --> 33:06.340\n That's how independent countries are born.\n\n33:06.340 --> 33:08.340\n Ukraine doesn't get any of that.\n\n33:08.340 --> 33:10.020\n No one is stepping into that\n\n33:10.020 --> 33:14.020\n because we live in a world right now\n\n33:14.020 --> 33:17.780\n where there simply is no economic benefits\n\n33:17.780 --> 33:21.580\n to the parties in power to support Ukraine to that level.\n\n33:21.580 --> 33:24.500\n And war is a game of economics.\n\n33:24.500 --> 33:28.900\n The economic benefit of Ukraine is crystal clear\n\n33:28.900 --> 33:31.420\n in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose.\n\n33:31.420 --> 33:33.540\n He will not let himself lose.\n\n33:33.540 --> 33:36.580\n Short of something completely unexpected, right?\n\n33:36.580 --> 33:40.100\n I'm talking 60%, 70% probability, Ukraine loses.\n\n33:40.100 --> 33:42.540\n But there's still 20%, 30% probability\n\n33:42.540 --> 33:44.700\n of the unimaginable happening.\n\n33:44.700 --> 33:45.860\n Who knows what that might be?\n\n33:45.860 --> 33:48.060\n An oligarch assassinates Putin\n\n33:48.060 --> 33:50.500\n or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere\n\n33:50.500 --> 33:52.940\n or who knows what, right?\n\n33:52.940 --> 33:53.940\n There's still a chance\n\n33:53.940 --> 33:55.540\n that something unexpected will happen\n\n33:55.540 --> 33:57.580\n and change the tide of the war.\n\n33:57.580 --> 34:01.580\n But when it comes down to the core calculus here,\n\n34:01.580 --> 34:06.260\n Ukraine is the agricultural bed to support a future Russia.\n\n34:06.260 --> 34:09.580\n Russia knows, they know they have to have Ukraine.\n\n34:09.580 --> 34:11.740\n They know that they have to have it to protect themselves\n\n34:11.740 --> 34:13.540\n against military pressure from the West.\n\n34:13.540 --> 34:15.620\n They have to have it for agricultural reasons.\n\n34:15.620 --> 34:20.100\n They have major oil and natural gas pipelines\n\n34:20.100 --> 34:22.620\n that flow through Eastern Ukraine.\n\n34:22.620 --> 34:25.500\n They cannot let Ukraine fall\n\n34:25.500 --> 34:27.220\n outside of their sphere of influence.\n\n34:27.220 --> 34:28.420\n They cannot.\n\n34:28.420 --> 34:31.060\n The United States doesn't really have\n\n34:31.060 --> 34:33.620\n any economic vested interest in Ukraine.\n\n34:33.620 --> 34:37.740\n Ideological points of view and promises aside,\n\n34:37.740 --> 34:39.220\n there's no economic benefit.\n\n34:39.220 --> 34:41.260\n And the same thing goes for NATO.\n\n34:41.260 --> 34:44.420\n NATO has no economic investment in Ukraine.\n\n34:44.420 --> 34:49.180\n Ukrainian output, Ukrainian food\n\n34:49.180 --> 34:51.060\n goes to the Middle East and Africa.\n\n34:51.060 --> 34:53.780\n It doesn't go to Europe.\n\n34:53.780 --> 34:58.260\n So the whole, the West siding with Ukraine\n\n34:58.260 --> 35:00.340\n is exclusively ideological\n\n35:00.340 --> 35:02.420\n and it's putting them in a place\n\n35:02.420 --> 35:04.100\n where they fight a war with Russia\n\n35:04.100 --> 35:06.540\n so the whole world can see Russia's capabilities.\n\n35:06.540 --> 35:09.660\n Ukraine is a, as sad as it is to say, man,\n\n35:09.660 --> 35:14.660\n Ukraine is a pawn on a table for superpowers\n\n35:14.660 --> 35:17.420\n to calculate each other's capacities.\n\n35:17.420 --> 35:19.660\n Right now we've only talked about Russia and the United States.\n\n35:19.660 --> 35:21.140\n We haven't even talked about Iran.\n\n35:21.140 --> 35:23.740\n We haven't even talked about China, right?\n\n35:23.740 --> 35:24.980\n It is a pawn on a table.\n\n35:24.980 --> 35:27.340\n This is a chicken fight so that people get to watch\n\n35:27.340 --> 35:29.620\n and see what the other trainers are doing.\n\n35:29.620 --> 35:31.580\n Well, a lot of people might've said the same thing\n\n35:31.580 --> 35:34.140\n about the United States back in the independence fight.\n\n35:34.140 --> 35:38.420\n So there is possibilities, as you've said.\n\n35:38.420 --> 35:41.900\n We're not saying a 0% chance\n\n35:41.900 --> 35:44.580\n and it could be a reasonably high percent chance\n\n35:44.580 --> 35:48.060\n that this becomes one of the great democratic nations\n\n35:48.060 --> 35:50.140\n that the 21st century is remembered by.\n\n35:50.140 --> 35:50.980\n Absolutely.\n\n35:50.980 --> 35:55.100\n And so you said American support.\n\n35:55.100 --> 35:57.580\n So ideologically, first of all,\n\n35:57.580 --> 36:02.580\n you don't assign much longterm power to that.\n\n36:03.180 --> 36:05.980\n That US could support Ukraine\n\n36:05.980 --> 36:09.140\n purely on ideological grounds.\n\n36:09.140 --> 36:12.820\n Just look in the last four years, the last three years.\n\n36:12.820 --> 36:14.460\n Do you remember what happened in Hong Kong\n\n36:14.460 --> 36:15.460\n right before COVID?\n\n36:16.860 --> 36:20.500\n China swooped into Hong Kong violently,\n\n36:21.540 --> 36:23.820\n beating protesters, killing them in the street,\n\n36:23.820 --> 36:26.700\n imprisoning people without just cause.\n\n36:26.700 --> 36:28.860\n And Hong Kong was a democracy\n\n36:30.060 --> 36:32.580\n and the whole world stood by and let it happen.\n\n36:32.580 --> 36:35.580\n And then what happened in Afghanistan just a year ago\n\n36:35.580 --> 36:37.740\n and the whole world stood by\n\n36:37.740 --> 36:39.580\n and let the Taliban take power again\n\n36:39.580 --> 36:41.700\n after 20 years of loss.\n\n36:41.700 --> 36:46.420\n This, we are showing a repeatable point of view.\n\n36:46.420 --> 36:47.700\n We will talk.\n\n36:47.700 --> 36:50.900\n American politicians, American administrations,\n\n36:50.900 --> 36:52.940\n we will say a lot of things.\n\n36:52.940 --> 36:56.340\n We will promise a lot of ideological pro democracy,\n\n36:56.340 --> 36:58.420\n rah rah statements.\n\n36:58.420 --> 36:59.820\n We will say it.\n\n36:59.820 --> 37:02.740\n But when it comes down to putting our own people,\n\n37:02.740 --> 37:07.260\n our own economy, our own GDP at risk,\n\n37:07.260 --> 37:09.260\n we step away from that fight.\n\n37:09.260 --> 37:11.500\n America is currently supplying\n\n37:11.500 --> 37:13.060\n military equipment to Ukraine.\n\n37:13.060 --> 37:13.900\n Absolutely.\n\n37:13.900 --> 37:14.980\n And a lot of that military equipment\n\n37:14.980 --> 37:17.500\n has actually been the thing that turned\n\n37:17.500 --> 37:20.540\n the tides of war a couple of times already.\n\n37:20.540 --> 37:22.620\n Currently that's the high mar systems.\n\n37:23.500 --> 37:27.700\n So you mentioned sort of Putin can't afford to lose,\n\n37:27.700 --> 37:29.980\n but winning can look in different ways.\n\n37:29.980 --> 37:32.180\n So you've kind of defined so on.\n\n37:32.180 --> 37:35.980\n At this moment, the prediction is that winning\n\n37:35.980 --> 37:38.860\n looks like capturing not just the east,\n\n37:38.860 --> 37:41.260\n but the south of Ukraine.\n\n37:41.260 --> 37:44.540\n But you can have narratives of winning\n\n37:44.540 --> 37:48.820\n that return back to what was at the beginning of this year\n\n37:48.820 --> 37:49.820\n before the invasion.\n\n37:49.820 --> 37:50.660\n Correct.\n\n37:50.660 --> 37:53.820\n That Crimea is still with Russia.\n\n37:53.820 --> 37:56.660\n There's some kind of negotiated thing about Donbass\n\n37:56.660 --> 37:58.140\n where it still stays with Ukraine,\n\n37:58.140 --> 37:59.580\n but there's some.\n\n37:59.580 --> 38:00.420\n Puppet government.\n\n38:00.420 --> 38:01.260\n Yeah.\n\n38:01.260 --> 38:03.740\n Just like that's what they have in Georgia right now.\n\n38:03.740 --> 38:07.300\n And that could still be defined through mechanisms.\n\n38:07.300 --> 38:08.340\n As Russia winning.\n\n38:08.340 --> 38:11.020\n As Russia winning for Russia and then for Ukraine\n\n38:11.020 --> 38:16.020\n as Ukraine winning and for the west as democracy winning\n\n38:16.980 --> 38:19.060\n and you kind of negotiate.\n\n38:19.060 --> 38:22.260\n I mean, that seems to be how geopolitics works\n\n38:22.260 --> 38:25.860\n is everybody can walk away with a win win story\n\n38:25.860 --> 38:28.980\n and then the world progresses with the lessons learned.\n\n38:28.980 --> 38:29.860\n That's the high likely.\n\n38:29.860 --> 38:31.580\n That's the most probable outcome.\n\n38:31.580 --> 38:35.820\n The most probable outcome is that Ukraine remains\n\n38:35.820 --> 38:38.820\n in air quotes, a sovereign nation.\n\n38:38.820 --> 38:41.380\n It's not going to be truly sovereign\n\n38:41.380 --> 38:43.540\n because it will become,\n\n38:43.540 --> 38:47.460\n it will have to have new government put in place.\n\n38:47.460 --> 38:50.660\n Zelinsky will, it's extremely unlikely he will be president\n\n38:50.660 --> 38:55.460\n because he has gone too far to demonstrate his power\n\n38:55.460 --> 38:58.140\n over the people and his ability to separate\n\n38:58.140 --> 39:02.420\n the Ukrainian people from the autocratic power of Russia.\n\n39:02.420 --> 39:06.420\n So he would have to be unseated whether he goes into exile\n\n39:06.420 --> 39:09.380\n or whether he is peacefully left alone\n\n39:09.380 --> 39:11.100\n is all gonna be part of negotiations.\n\n39:11.100 --> 39:14.220\n But the thing to keep in mind also is that\n\n39:14.220 --> 39:17.740\n a negotiated peace really just means a negotiated ceasefire.\n\n39:17.740 --> 39:19.060\n We've seen this happen all over the world.\n\n39:19.060 --> 39:20.780\n North Korea and South Korea are technically still\n\n39:20.780 --> 39:23.060\n just in negotiated cease power.\n\n39:23.060 --> 39:27.140\n What you end up having is Russia will allow Ukraine\n\n39:27.140 --> 39:29.620\n to call itself Ukraine, to operate independently,\n\n39:29.620 --> 39:32.020\n to have their own debt to the United States.\n\n39:32.020 --> 39:34.420\n Russia doesn't wanna take on that debt.\n\n39:34.420 --> 39:36.660\n And then in exchange for that,\n\n39:36.660 --> 39:38.700\n they will have firmer guidelines\n\n39:38.700 --> 39:41.660\n as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine.\n\n39:41.660 --> 39:43.140\n And then that becomes an example\n\n39:43.140 --> 39:45.180\n for all the other former Soviet satellite states,\n\n39:45.180 --> 39:48.100\n which are all required economically by Russia,\n\n39:48.100 --> 39:50.660\n not required economically by the West.\n\n39:51.660 --> 39:53.780\n And then you end up seeing how it just,\n\n39:53.780 --> 39:55.460\n you can see how the whole thing plays out\n\n39:55.460 --> 39:59.260\n once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine.\n\n40:00.140 --> 40:02.100\n There is something about Ukraine,\n\n40:02.100 --> 40:05.500\n the deep support by the Ukrainian people of America\n\n40:05.500 --> 40:09.780\n that is in contrast with, for example, Afghanistan,\n\n40:10.860 --> 40:14.100\n that it seems like ideologically,\n\n40:14.100 --> 40:17.180\n Ukraine could be a beacon of freedom\n\n40:17.180 --> 40:20.180\n used in narratives by the United States\n\n40:20.180 --> 40:24.180\n to fight geopolitical wars in that part of the world,\n\n40:24.180 --> 40:26.100\n that they would be a good partner\n\n40:26.100 --> 40:28.940\n for this idea of democracy, of freedom,\n\n40:28.940 --> 40:31.500\n of all the values that America stands for.\n\n40:31.500 --> 40:32.780\n They're a good partner.\n\n40:32.780 --> 40:35.100\n And so it's valuable,\n\n40:35.100 --> 40:38.740\n if you sort of have a cynical, pragmatic view,\n\n40:38.740 --> 40:41.500\n sort of like Henry Kissinger type of view,\n\n40:41.500 --> 40:43.900\n it's valuable to have them as a partner,\n\n40:43.900 --> 40:47.380\n so valuable that it makes sense to support them\n\n40:47.380 --> 40:50.100\n in achieving a negotiated ceasefire\n\n40:50.100 --> 40:51.980\n that's on the side of Ukraine.\n\n40:51.980 --> 40:54.420\n But because of this particular leader,\n\n40:54.420 --> 40:56.220\n this particular culture,\n\n40:56.220 --> 41:00.540\n this particular dynamics of how the war unrolled\n\n41:00.540 --> 41:02.580\n and things like Twitter\n\n41:02.580 --> 41:05.100\n and the way digital communication currently works,\n\n41:05.100 --> 41:08.060\n it just seems like this is a powerful symbol of freedom\n\n41:08.060 --> 41:09.900\n that's useful for the United States\n\n41:09.900 --> 41:12.660\n if we're sort of to take the pragmatic view.\n\n41:12.660 --> 41:16.460\n Don't you think it's possible\n\n41:16.460 --> 41:20.500\n that United States supports Ukraine\n\n41:20.500 --> 41:22.660\n financially, militarily enough\n\n41:22.660 --> 41:25.220\n for it to get an advantage in this war?\n\n41:25.220 --> 41:27.340\n I think they've already gotten advantage in the war.\n\n41:27.340 --> 41:28.820\n The fact that the war is still going on\n\n41:28.820 --> 41:30.820\n demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage.\n\n41:30.820 --> 41:33.420\n The fact that Russia has stepped up\n\n41:33.420 --> 41:36.460\n to the negotiating table with them several times\n\n41:36.460 --> 41:41.180\n without just turning to Chechen,\n\n41:41.180 --> 41:43.180\n I mean, you remember what happened in Chechnya,\n\n41:43.180 --> 41:45.060\n without turning to Chechnya level,\n\n41:45.060 --> 41:48.540\n just mass blind destruction,\n\n41:48.540 --> 41:51.540\n which was another Putin war.\n\n41:51.540 --> 41:53.180\n To see that those things have happened\n\n41:53.180 --> 41:54.860\n demonstrates the asymmetric advantage\n\n41:54.860 --> 41:56.140\n that the West has given.\n\n41:56.140 --> 42:01.820\n I think the true way to look at the benefit of Ukraine\n\n42:01.820 --> 42:06.740\n as a shining example of freedom in Europe for the West\n\n42:06.740 --> 42:08.980\n isn't to understand whether or not they could.\n\n42:08.980 --> 42:10.620\n They absolutely could.\n\n42:10.620 --> 42:14.940\n It's the question of how valuable is that in Europe?\n\n42:14.940 --> 42:16.740\n How valuable is Ukraine?\n\n42:16.740 --> 42:22.380\n Which before February, nobody even thought about Ukraine.\n\n42:22.380 --> 42:24.380\n And the people who did know about Ukraine\n\n42:24.380 --> 42:28.900\n knew that it was an extremely corrupt former Soviet state\n\n42:28.900 --> 42:30.940\n with 20% of its national population\n\n42:30.940 --> 42:33.660\n self identifying as Russian.\n\n42:33.660 --> 42:35.460\n There's a reason Putin went into Ukraine.\n\n42:35.460 --> 42:37.020\n There's a reason he's been promising\n\n42:37.020 --> 42:40.540\n he would go into Ukraine for the better part of a decade.\n\n42:40.540 --> 42:43.660\n Because the circumstances were aligned,\n\n42:43.660 --> 42:45.580\n it was a corrupt country that self identified\n\n42:45.580 --> 42:47.420\n as Russian in many ways.\n\n42:47.420 --> 42:51.980\n It was supposed to be an easier of multiple marks\n\n42:51.980 --> 42:55.900\n in terms of the former Soviet satellite states to go after.\n\n42:55.900 --> 42:57.940\n That's all part of the miscalculation\n\n42:57.940 --> 42:59.860\n that the rest of the world saw too\n\n42:59.860 --> 43:02.860\n when we thought it would fall quickly.\n\n43:02.860 --> 43:05.900\n So to think that it could be a shining example of freedom\n\n43:05.900 --> 43:06.980\n is accurate.\n\n43:06.980 --> 43:10.220\n But is it as shining a star as Germany?\n\n43:10.220 --> 43:11.940\n Is it as shining a star as the UK?\n\n43:11.940 --> 43:13.940\n Is it as shining a star as Romania?\n\n43:13.940 --> 43:17.860\n Is it as shiny a star as France?\n\n43:17.860 --> 43:22.380\n It's got a lot of democratic freedom based countries\n\n43:22.380 --> 43:23.660\n in Europe to compete against\n\n43:23.660 --> 43:26.780\n to be the shining stellar example.\n\n43:26.780 --> 43:29.900\n And in exchange, on counterpoint to that,\n\n43:29.900 --> 43:33.540\n it has an extreme amount of strategic value to Russia\n\n43:33.540 --> 43:36.060\n which has no interest in making it a shining star\n\n43:36.060 --> 43:38.460\n of the example of democracy and freedom.\n\n43:38.460 --> 43:41.700\n Outside of research in terms of the shininess of the star,\n\n43:41.700 --> 43:43.060\n I would argue yes.\n\n43:43.060 --> 43:45.140\n If you look at how much it captivated\n\n43:45.140 --> 43:46.460\n the attention of the world.\n\n43:46.460 --> 43:47.300\n The attention of the world\n\n43:47.300 --> 43:49.020\n has made no material difference, man.\n\n43:49.020 --> 43:50.300\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n43:50.300 --> 43:53.580\n That's your estimation, but are you sure we can,\n\n43:53.580 --> 43:58.580\n we can't, if you can convert that into political influence\n\n43:59.060 --> 44:03.500\n into money, don't you think attention is money?\n\n44:03.500 --> 44:07.500\n Attention is money in democracies and capitalist countries.\n\n44:07.500 --> 44:08.340\n Yes.\n\n44:08.340 --> 44:09.460\n Which serves as a counterweight\n\n44:09.460 --> 44:11.420\n to sort of authoritarian regimes.\n\n44:11.420 --> 44:14.460\n So for Putin, resources matter.\n\n44:14.460 --> 44:16.500\n For the United States, also resources matter,\n\n44:16.500 --> 44:21.220\n but the attention and the belief of the people also matter\n\n44:21.220 --> 44:24.660\n because that's how you attain and maintain political power.\n\n44:24.660 --> 44:26.940\n So going to that exact example,\n\n44:26.940 --> 44:29.340\n then I would highlight that our current administration\n\n44:29.340 --> 44:33.620\n has the lowest approval ratings of any president in history.\n\n44:33.620 --> 44:36.740\n So if people were very fond of the war going on in Ukraine,\n\n44:36.740 --> 44:39.220\n wouldn't that counterbalance some of our upset,\n\n44:39.220 --> 44:41.980\n some of the dissent coming from the economy\n\n44:41.980 --> 44:45.780\n and some of the dissent coming from the great recession\n\n44:45.780 --> 44:48.620\n or the second great, or the great resignation\n\n44:48.620 --> 44:49.980\n and whatever's happening with the draw\n\n44:49.980 --> 44:51.380\n with the down stock market?\n\n44:51.380 --> 44:52.540\n You would think that people would feel\n\n44:52.540 --> 44:54.620\n like they're sacrificing for something\n\n44:54.620 --> 44:57.940\n if they really believed that Ukraine mattered,\n\n44:57.940 --> 45:00.300\n that they would stand next to the president\n\n45:00.300 --> 45:05.060\n who is so staunchly driving and leading the West\n\n45:05.060 --> 45:06.780\n against this conflict.\n\n45:06.780 --> 45:09.780\n Well, I think the opposition to this particular president,\n\n45:09.780 --> 45:12.660\n I personally believe has less to do with the policies\n\n45:12.660 --> 45:16.940\n and more to do with a lot of the other human factors.\n\n45:19.220 --> 45:20.860\n But again, empirically, this is,\n\n45:20.860 --> 45:22.980\n I look at things through a very empirical lens,\n\n45:22.980 --> 45:26.900\n a very cold fact based lens.\n\n45:26.900 --> 45:29.500\n And there are multiple data points that suggest\n\n45:29.500 --> 45:32.420\n that the American people ideologically sympathize\n\n45:32.420 --> 45:34.420\n with Ukraine, but they really just want\n\n45:34.420 --> 45:36.020\n their gas prices to go down.\n\n45:36.020 --> 45:38.180\n They really just want to be able to pay less money\n\n45:38.180 --> 45:39.940\n at the grocery store for their food.\n\n45:39.940 --> 45:41.700\n And they most definitely don't want their sons\n\n45:41.700 --> 45:45.220\n and daughters to die in exchange for Ukrainian freedom.\n\n45:46.100 --> 45:47.900\n It does hurt me to see the politicization\n\n45:47.900 --> 45:48.980\n of this war as well.\n\n45:50.340 --> 45:54.940\n I think that maybe has to do with the kind of calculation\n\n45:54.940 --> 45:58.700\n you're referring to, but it seems like it doesn't.\n\n45:58.700 --> 46:00.660\n It seems like there's a cynical,\n\n46:00.660 --> 46:05.180\n whatever takes attention of the media for the moment,\n\n46:05.180 --> 46:07.100\n the red team chooses one side\n\n46:07.100 --> 46:08.940\n and the blue team chooses another.\n\n46:08.940 --> 46:12.260\n And then I think, correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n46:12.260 --> 46:17.260\n but I believe the Democrats went into full support\n\n46:17.380 --> 46:20.100\n of Ukraine on the ideological side.\n\n46:20.100 --> 46:22.180\n And then I guess Republicans are saying,\n\n46:22.180 --> 46:23.220\n why are we wasting money?\n\n46:23.220 --> 46:25.860\n The gas prices are going up.\n\n46:25.860 --> 46:27.660\n That's a very crude kind of analysis,\n\n46:27.660 --> 46:29.740\n but they basically picked whatever argument\n\n46:29.740 --> 46:33.660\n on whatever side, and now more and more and more,\n\n46:33.660 --> 46:37.260\n this particular war in Ukraine is becoming\n\n46:37.260 --> 46:40.060\n a kind of pawn in the game of politics\n\n46:40.060 --> 46:42.700\n that's first the midterm elections,\n\n46:42.700 --> 46:44.900\n then building up towards the presidential elections,\n\n46:44.900 --> 46:49.900\n and stops being about the philosophical, the social,\n\n46:49.940 --> 46:53.780\n the geopolitical aspects, parameters of this war,\n\n46:53.780 --> 46:55.900\n and more about just like whatever the heck\n\n46:55.900 --> 46:58.900\n captivates Twitter, and we're gonna use that for politics.\n\n46:58.900 --> 47:02.340\n You're right in the sense of the fact that it's,\n\n47:02.340 --> 47:03.940\n I wouldn't say that the red team and the blue team\n\n47:03.940 --> 47:05.300\n picked opposite sides on this.\n\n47:05.300 --> 47:08.860\n What I would say is that media discovered\n\n47:08.860 --> 47:12.300\n that talking about Ukraine wasn't as profitable\n\n47:12.300 --> 47:13.980\n as talking about something else.\n\n47:13.980 --> 47:17.580\n People simply, the American people who read media\n\n47:17.580 --> 47:20.820\n or who watch media, they simply became bored\n\n47:20.820 --> 47:23.940\n reading about news that didn't seem to be changing much.\n\n47:23.940 --> 47:26.540\n And we turned back into wanting to read\n\n47:26.540 --> 47:28.460\n about our own economy, and we wanted to hear more\n\n47:28.460 --> 47:30.060\n about cryptocurrency, and we wanted to hear more\n\n47:30.060 --> 47:32.380\n about the Kardashians, and that's what we care about,\n\n47:32.380 --> 47:33.820\n so that's what media writes about.\n\n47:33.820 --> 47:37.380\n That's how a capitalist market driven world works,\n\n47:37.380 --> 47:38.380\n and that's how the United States works.\n\n47:38.380 --> 47:41.100\n That's why in both red papers and blue papers,\n\n47:41.100 --> 47:42.700\n red sources and blue sources,\n\n47:42.700 --> 47:44.620\n you don't see Ukraine being mentioned very much.\n\n47:44.620 --> 47:47.180\n If anything, I would say that your Republicans\n\n47:47.180 --> 47:49.340\n are probably more in support of what's happening\n\n47:49.340 --> 47:51.340\n in Ukraine right now, because we're creating\n\n47:51.340 --> 47:53.660\n new weapon systems, our military is getting stronger,\n\n47:53.660 --> 47:57.660\n we're sending these, we get to test military systems\n\n47:57.660 --> 48:02.060\n in combat in Ukraine, that's priceless.\n\n48:02.060 --> 48:05.340\n In the world of the military industrial complex,\n\n48:05.340 --> 48:10.020\n being able to field test, combat test a weapon\n\n48:10.020 --> 48:12.500\n without having to sacrifice your own people\n\n48:12.500 --> 48:13.660\n is incredibly valuable.\n\n48:13.660 --> 48:15.740\n You get all the data, you get all the performance metrics,\n\n48:15.740 --> 48:17.540\n but you don't have to put yourself at risk.\n\n48:17.540 --> 48:21.100\n That is one of the major benefits of what we're seeing\n\n48:21.100 --> 48:23.700\n from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops.\n\n48:23.700 --> 48:26.540\n The longterm benefit to what will come of this\n\n48:26.540 --> 48:30.780\n for the United States, practically speaking,\n\n48:30.780 --> 48:32.740\n in the lens of national security,\n\n48:32.740 --> 48:34.420\n through military readiness,\n\n48:34.420 --> 48:38.540\n through future economic benefits, those are super strong.\n\n48:38.540 --> 48:42.180\n The geopolitical fight is essentially moot,\n\n48:42.180 --> 48:45.100\n because Ukraine is not a geopolitical player.\n\n48:45.100 --> 48:50.100\n It was not for 70 years, and after this conflict is over,\n\n48:50.220 --> 48:51.420\n it will not again.\n\n48:51.420 --> 48:53.260\n Just think about what you were just saying\n\n48:53.260 --> 48:55.500\n with the American people's attention span\n\n48:55.500 --> 48:57.300\n to Twitter and whatever's currently going on.\n\n48:57.300 --> 49:00.500\n If the Ukraine conflict resolved itself today\n\n49:00.500 --> 49:04.460\n in any direction, how many weeks do you think\n\n49:04.460 --> 49:06.260\n before no one talked about Ukraine anymore?\n\n49:06.260 --> 49:07.780\n Do you think we would make it two weeks?\n\n49:07.780 --> 49:09.540\n Or do you think we'd make it maybe seven days?\n\n49:09.540 --> 49:11.780\n It would be headline news for one or two days,\n\n49:13.140 --> 49:15.020\n and then we'd be onto something else.\n\n49:15.020 --> 49:17.700\n It's just an unfortunate reality\n\n49:17.700 --> 49:21.980\n of how the world works in a capitalist democracy.\n\n49:21.980 --> 49:26.980\n Yeah, it just breaks my heart how much,\n\n49:27.540 --> 49:30.740\n you know, I know that there's Yemen and Syria\n\n49:30.740 --> 49:33.740\n and that nobody talks about anymore.\n\n49:33.740 --> 49:35.600\n Still raging conflicts going on.\n\n49:37.460 --> 49:42.300\n It breaks my heart how much generational hatred is born.\n\n49:42.300 --> 49:46.820\n I happen to be from, my family is from Ukraine\n\n49:46.820 --> 49:49.580\n and from Russia, and so for me, just personally,\n\n49:49.580 --> 49:51.860\n it's a part of the world I care about.\n\n49:51.860 --> 49:56.860\n In terms of its history, because I speak the language,\n\n49:56.940 --> 49:58.940\n I can appreciate the beauty of the literature,\n\n49:58.940 --> 50:01.420\n the music, the art, the cultural history\n\n50:01.420 --> 50:04.560\n of the 20th century through all the dark times,\n\n50:04.560 --> 50:09.000\n through all the hell of the dark sides\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:12.260\n of authoritarian regimes, the destruction of war.\n\n50:12.260 --> 50:14.420\n There's still just the beauty that I'm able to appreciate\n\n50:14.420 --> 50:17.700\n that I can't appreciate about China, Brazil,\n\n50:17.700 --> 50:19.700\n other countries because I don't speak their language.\n\n50:19.700 --> 50:20.900\n This one I can appreciate.\n\n50:20.900 --> 50:24.460\n And so in that way, this is personally really painful to me\n\n50:24.460 --> 50:28.520\n to see so much of that history, the beauty in that history\n\n50:28.520 --> 50:31.020\n suffocated by the hatred that is born\n\n50:31.020 --> 50:34.980\n through this kind of geopolitical game\n\n50:36.240 --> 50:39.980\n fought mostly by the politicians, the leaders.\n\n50:39.980 --> 50:42.840\n People are beautiful, and that's what you're talking about.\n\n50:42.840 --> 50:47.220\n People are just, people are beautiful creatures.\n\n50:47.220 --> 50:52.160\n Culture and art and science,\n\n50:52.160 --> 50:53.700\n these are beautiful, beautiful things\n\n50:53.700 --> 50:55.900\n that come about because of human beings.\n\n50:55.900 --> 50:58.980\n And the thing that gives me hope is that\n\n51:00.260 --> 51:02.600\n no matter what conflict the world has seen,\n\n51:02.600 --> 51:04.540\n and we've seen some devastating,\n\n51:04.540 --> 51:07.360\n horrible crimes against humanity already.\n\n51:07.360 --> 51:10.060\n We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan.\n\n51:10.060 --> 51:13.780\n We saw genocide happen in Rwanda.\n\n51:13.780 --> 51:16.300\n We've seen horrible things happen.\n\n51:16.300 --> 51:18.260\n But people persevere.\n\n51:18.260 --> 51:21.420\n Language, culture, arts, science, they all persevere.\n\n51:21.420 --> 51:23.600\n They all shine through.\n\n51:23.600 --> 51:25.420\n Some of the most, people don't even realize\n\n51:25.420 --> 51:27.940\n how gorgeous the architecture and the culture is\n\n51:27.940 --> 51:29.060\n inside Iran.\n\n51:29.060 --> 51:30.160\n People have no idea.\n\n51:31.600 --> 51:35.820\n Chinese people in the rural parts of China\n\n51:35.820 --> 51:38.360\n are some of the kindest, most amazing people\n\n51:38.360 --> 51:39.580\n you'll ever meet.\n\n51:39.580 --> 51:44.580\n And Korean art and Korean dance, Korean drumming,\n\n51:44.580 --> 51:47.300\n I know nobody has ever even heard of Korean drumming.\n\n51:47.300 --> 51:50.380\n Korean drumming is this magical, beautiful thing.\n\n51:50.380 --> 51:53.020\n And the North, in North Korea, does it better\n\n51:53.020 --> 51:54.460\n than anybody in the world.\n\n51:54.460 --> 51:57.780\n Taekwondo in North Korea is just exceptional to watch.\n\n51:57.780 --> 51:58.620\n In North Korea?\n\n51:58.620 --> 51:59.500\n In North Korea.\n\n51:59.500 --> 52:00.340\n Nobody knows these things.\n\n52:00.340 --> 52:02.380\n How do you know about Taekwondo in North Korea?\n\n52:02.380 --> 52:03.220\n I have questions.\n\n52:04.660 --> 52:05.500\n That's fascinating.\n\n52:05.500 --> 52:08.180\n That's, people don't think about that,\n\n52:08.180 --> 52:09.820\n but the culture, the beauty of the people\n\n52:09.820 --> 52:11.860\n still flourishes even in the toughest of places.\n\n52:11.860 --> 52:13.700\n Absolutely, and we always will.\n\n52:13.700 --> 52:16.340\n We always will because that is what people do.\n\n52:16.340 --> 52:18.500\n And that is just the truth of it.\n\n52:18.500 --> 52:21.140\n And it breaks my heart to see travesties\n\n52:21.140 --> 52:23.860\n that people commit against people.\n\n52:23.860 --> 52:26.460\n But whether you're looking at a micro level,\n\n52:26.460 --> 52:30.100\n like what happens with shootings here in the United States,\n\n52:30.100 --> 52:31.900\n or whether you look at a macro level,\n\n52:31.900 --> 52:35.020\n like geopolitical power exchanges\n\n52:35.020 --> 52:37.540\n and intra and interstate conflicts,\n\n52:37.540 --> 52:40.400\n like what you see in Syria and what you see in Ukraine,\n\n52:40.400 --> 52:42.180\n those are disgusting, terrible things.\n\n52:42.180 --> 52:43.820\n War is a terrible thing.\n\n52:43.820 --> 52:45.340\n That is a famous quote.\n\n52:47.060 --> 52:49.780\n But people will persevere.\n\n52:49.780 --> 52:52.060\n People will come through.\n\n52:53.100 --> 52:54.300\n I hope so.\n\n52:54.300 --> 52:55.540\n I hope so.\n\n52:55.540 --> 52:58.100\n And I hope we don't do something\n\n52:59.980 --> 53:03.300\n that I'll probably also ask you about later on\n\n53:03.300 --> 53:08.180\n is things that destroy the possibility of perseverance,\n\n53:08.180 --> 53:09.860\n which is things like nuclear war,\n\n53:09.860 --> 53:14.300\n things that can do such tremendous damage\n\n53:14.300 --> 53:17.060\n that we will never recover.\n\n53:17.060 --> 53:21.060\n But yeah, amidst your pragmatic pessimism,\n\n53:22.100 --> 53:24.660\n I think both you and I have a kind of\n\n53:24.660 --> 53:27.020\n maybe small flame of optimism in there\n\n53:27.020 --> 53:30.540\n about the perseverance of the human species in general.\n\n53:30.540 --> 53:33.800\n Let me ask you about intelligence agencies\n\n53:33.800 --> 53:35.240\n outside of the CIA.\n\n53:35.240 --> 53:40.240\n Can you illuminate what is the most powerful\n\n53:41.500 --> 53:43.880\n intelligence agency in the world?\n\n53:43.880 --> 53:48.720\n The CIA, the FSB, formerly the KGB, the MI6, Mossad.\n\n53:49.620 --> 53:52.860\n I've gotten a chance to interact with a lot of Israelis\n\n53:52.860 --> 53:54.180\n while in Ukraine.\n\n53:54.180 --> 53:56.380\n Just incredible people.\n\n53:56.380 --> 53:58.180\n Yeah, in terms of both training and skill,\n\n53:58.180 --> 54:00.080\n just every front.\n\n54:00.080 --> 54:04.220\n American soldiers too, just American military is incredible.\n\n54:04.220 --> 54:07.400\n I just, the competence and skill of the military,\n\n54:08.500 --> 54:10.980\n the United States, Israeli I got to interact,\n\n54:10.980 --> 54:12.560\n and Ukrainian as well.\n\n54:12.560 --> 54:13.400\n It's striking.\n\n54:13.400 --> 54:14.420\n It's striking, it's beautiful.\n\n54:14.420 --> 54:16.860\n I just love people, I love carpenters,\n\n54:16.860 --> 54:19.300\n or people that are just extremely good at their job\n\n54:19.300 --> 54:21.400\n and then take pride in their craftsmanship.\n\n54:21.400 --> 54:22.780\n It's beautiful to see.\n\n54:22.780 --> 54:24.580\n And I imagine the same kind of thing happens\n\n54:24.580 --> 54:27.260\n inside of intelligence agencies as well\n\n54:27.260 --> 54:29.940\n that we don't get to appreciate because of the secrecy.\n\n54:29.940 --> 54:31.500\n Same thing with like Lockheed Martin.\n\n54:31.500 --> 54:34.220\n I interviewed the CTO of Lockheed Martin.\n\n54:34.220 --> 54:37.200\n It breaks my heart, as a person who loves engineering,\n\n54:38.380 --> 54:41.120\n because of the cover of secrecy,\n\n54:41.120 --> 54:43.300\n we'll never get to know some of the incredible engineering\n\n54:43.300 --> 54:46.580\n that happens inside of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon.\n\n54:46.580 --> 54:49.260\n Yeah, you know, there's kind of this idea\n\n54:49.260 --> 54:52.300\n that these are, you know, people have conspiracy theories\n\n54:52.300 --> 54:56.780\n and kind of assign evil to these companies in some part,\n\n54:56.780 --> 54:59.320\n but I think there's beautiful people inside those companies,\n\n54:59.320 --> 55:02.660\n brilliant people, and some incredible science\n\n55:02.660 --> 55:04.380\n and engineering is happening there.\n\n55:04.380 --> 55:08.940\n Anyway, that said, the CIA, the FSB, the MI6,\n\n55:08.940 --> 55:13.420\n Mossad, China, I know very little about the...\n\n55:13.420 --> 55:14.820\n MSS, the Ministry of State Security.\n\n55:14.820 --> 55:16.520\n I don't know how much you know.\n\n55:16.520 --> 55:17.940\n Yeah.\n\n55:17.940 --> 55:19.780\n Or just other intelligence agencies.\n\n55:19.780 --> 55:21.820\n In India, Pakistan, I've also heard...\n\n55:21.820 --> 55:24.220\n Yeah, RAW is powerful, and so is ISSI.\n\n55:24.220 --> 55:26.860\n Yes, or ISSI.\n\n55:26.860 --> 55:30.420\n And then, of course, European nations in Germany and France.\n\n55:30.420 --> 55:33.700\n Yeah, so what can you say about the power,\n\n55:33.700 --> 55:35.900\n the influence of the different intelligence agencies\n\n55:35.900 --> 55:37.620\n within their nation and outside?\n\n55:37.620 --> 55:41.460\n Yeah, so to answer your question, your original question,\n\n55:41.460 --> 55:42.420\n which is the most powerful,\n\n55:42.420 --> 55:44.760\n I'm gonna have to give you a few different answers.\n\n55:44.760 --> 55:49.240\n So the most powerful intelligence organization in the world\n\n55:49.240 --> 55:53.180\n in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS,\n\n55:53.180 --> 55:54.820\n the Ministry of State Security,\n\n55:54.820 --> 55:57.800\n because they have created\n\n55:57.800 --> 56:01.260\n a single, solitary intelligence service\n\n56:01.260 --> 56:04.200\n that has global reach and is integrated\n\n56:04.200 --> 56:07.460\n with Chinese culture, so that essentially,\n\n56:07.460 --> 56:09.760\n every Chinese person anywhere in the world\n\n56:09.760 --> 56:11.500\n is an informant to the MSS,\n\n56:11.500 --> 56:15.460\n because that's their way of serving the Middle Kingdom,\n\n56:15.460 --> 56:18.780\n Zhongguo, the Central Kingdom, the Chinese word for China.\n\n56:19.760 --> 56:21.220\n So they're the strongest.\n\n56:21.220 --> 56:23.940\n They're the most powerful intelligence service\n\n56:23.940 --> 56:24.820\n in terms of reach.\n\n56:24.820 --> 56:27.140\n Most assets, most informants, most intelligence.\n\n56:27.140 --> 56:29.300\n So it's deeply integrated with the citizenry.\n\n56:29.300 --> 56:30.820\n Correct, with their culture.\n\n56:30.820 --> 56:32.980\n You know what a Chinese person who lives in Syria\n\n56:32.980 --> 56:34.340\n thinks of themself as?\n\n56:34.340 --> 56:35.520\n A Chinese person.\n\n56:35.520 --> 56:36.780\n Do you know what a Chinese person,\n\n56:36.780 --> 56:38.940\n a Chinese national living in the United States\n\n56:38.940 --> 56:40.140\n thinks of themself as?\n\n56:40.140 --> 56:41.640\n A Chinese person, right?\n\n56:41.640 --> 56:44.460\n Americans living abroad often think of ourselves\n\n56:44.460 --> 56:47.940\n as expats, expatriates, living on the local economy,\n\n56:47.940 --> 56:49.980\n embracing the local culture.\n\n56:49.980 --> 56:51.620\n That is not how Chinese people view\n\n56:51.620 --> 56:52.580\n traveling around the world.\n\n56:52.580 --> 56:54.460\n And by the way, if I may mention,\n\n56:54.460 --> 56:59.460\n I believe the way Mossad operates\n\n56:59.460 --> 57:01.100\n is a similar kind of thing,\n\n57:01.100 --> 57:04.460\n because people from Israel living abroad\n\n57:04.460 --> 57:07.740\n still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli.\n\n57:07.740 --> 57:08.940\n First.\n\n57:08.940 --> 57:11.740\n First, so that allows you to integrate the.\n\n57:11.740 --> 57:13.820\n Culture, and yep, the faith based aspects.\n\n57:13.820 --> 57:14.660\n Exactly right.\n\n57:14.660 --> 57:17.180\n But the number of people in Israel is much, much smaller.\n\n57:17.180 --> 57:18.020\n Exactly right.\n\n57:18.020 --> 57:18.840\n The number of people in China.\n\n57:18.840 --> 57:21.340\n When it comes to reach, China wins that game.\n\n57:21.340 --> 57:23.940\n When it comes to professional capability,\n\n57:23.940 --> 57:28.460\n it's the CIA by far, because budget wise,\n\n57:28.460 --> 57:30.260\n capability wise, weapons system wise,\n\n57:30.260 --> 57:31.500\n modern technology wise,\n\n57:31.500 --> 57:34.060\n CIA is the leader around the world,\n\n57:34.060 --> 57:36.780\n which is why every other intelligence organization out there\n\n57:36.780 --> 57:38.940\n wants to partner with CIA.\n\n57:38.940 --> 57:40.820\n They want to learn from CIA.\n\n57:40.820 --> 57:42.060\n They want to train with CIA.\n\n57:42.060 --> 57:45.300\n They want to partner on counter narcotics,\n\n57:45.300 --> 57:47.020\n and counter drug, and counter terrorism,\n\n57:47.020 --> 57:49.100\n and counter Uyghur, you name it,\n\n57:49.100 --> 57:50.340\n people want to partner with CIA.\n\n57:50.340 --> 57:51.500\n So CIA is the most powerful\n\n57:51.500 --> 57:54.540\n in terms of capability and wealth.\n\n57:54.540 --> 57:59.540\n And then you've got the idea, you've got tech.\n\n57:59.820 --> 58:04.620\n So tech alone, meaning corporate espionage,\n\n58:04.620 --> 58:09.020\n economic espionage, nothing beats DGSE in France.\n\n58:09.020 --> 58:10.660\n They're the top.\n\n58:10.660 --> 58:11.860\n They've got a massive budget\n\n58:11.860 --> 58:14.740\n that almost goes exclusively to stealing foreign secrets.\n\n58:14.740 --> 58:16.740\n They're the biggest threat to the United States,\n\n58:16.740 --> 58:19.580\n even above Russia and above China.\n\n58:19.580 --> 58:20.620\n DGSE in France\n\n58:20.620 --> 58:23.460\n is a massively powerful intelligence organization,\n\n58:23.460 --> 58:25.960\n but they're so exclusively focused\n\n58:25.960 --> 58:29.620\n on a handful of types of intelligence collection\n\n58:29.620 --> 58:31.920\n that nobody even really thinks that they exist.\n\n58:31.920 --> 58:35.640\n And then in terms of just terrifying violence,\n\n58:35.640 --> 58:36.700\n you have Mossad.\n\n58:36.700 --> 58:38.300\n Mossad will do anything.\n\n58:38.300 --> 58:42.140\n Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes\n\n58:42.140 --> 58:43.340\n to ensure the survival\n\n58:43.340 --> 58:46.460\n of every Israeli citizen around the world.\n\n58:46.460 --> 58:49.620\n Most other countries will stop at some point,\n\n58:49.620 --> 58:51.420\n but Mossad doesn't do that.\n\n58:51.420 --> 58:54.780\n So it's the lines you're willing to cross.\n\n58:54.780 --> 58:57.620\n And the reasons that you're willing to cross them.\n\n58:57.620 --> 59:02.620\n The CIA will let an American stay in jail in Russia,\n\n59:02.700 --> 59:06.140\n unlawfully, and seek a diplomatic solution.\n\n59:06.140 --> 59:07.860\n I mean, the United States has let people,\n\n59:07.860 --> 59:10.580\n there are two gentlemen from the 1950s\n\n59:10.580 --> 59:12.900\n who were imprisoned in China for 20 years\n\n59:12.900 --> 59:16.660\n waiting for diplomatic solutions to their release.\n\n59:16.660 --> 59:21.660\n So we do not kill to save a citizen, but Mossad will.\n\n59:26.620 --> 59:28.360\n And then they'll not just kill,\n\n59:28.360 --> 59:31.640\n they'll do large scale infiltration.\n\n59:31.640 --> 59:32.740\n They'll do amazing things.\n\n59:32.740 --> 59:35.660\n There is no, they spare no expense\n\n59:35.660 --> 59:38.340\n because it's a demonstration to their own people.\n\n59:38.340 --> 59:40.600\n Again, going back to the whole idea of influence.\n\n59:40.600 --> 59:45.600\n Every intelligence operation that sees the light of day\n\n59:45.940 --> 59:47.860\n has two purposes.\n\n59:47.860 --> 59:51.380\n The first purpose is the intelligence operation.\n\n59:51.380 --> 59:53.540\n But if it was just the intelligence operation,\n\n59:53.540 --> 59:54.940\n it would stay secret forever.\n\n59:54.940 --> 59:55.980\n The second purpose\n\n59:55.980 --> 59:57.980\n of every successful intelligence operation,\n\n59:57.980 --> 59:59.440\n when they become public,\n\n59:59.440 --> 1:00:02.160\n is to send a signal to the world.\n\n1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.400\n If you work against us, we will do this to you.\n\n1:00:05.400 --> 1:00:09.100\n If you work for us, we will take care of you in this way.\n\n1:00:09.100 --> 1:00:11.820\n It's a massive information campaign.\n\n1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:15.420\n Do you think in that way, CIA is not doing a good job?\n\n1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:20.420\n Because there is the FSB, perhaps much less so GRU,\n\n1:00:20.740 --> 1:00:24.660\n but the KGB did this well,\n\n1:00:24.660 --> 1:00:28.700\n which is to send a signal, like basically communicate\n\n1:00:28.700 --> 1:00:33.540\n that this is a terrifying organization with a lot of power.\n\n1:00:33.540 --> 1:00:35.780\n So Mossad is doing a good job of that.\n\n1:00:35.780 --> 1:00:36.820\n Correct.\n\n1:00:36.820 --> 1:00:39.720\n The psychological information warfare.\n\n1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:44.720\n And it seems like the CIA also has a lot of kind of myths\n\n1:00:47.380 --> 1:00:49.420\n about it, conspiracy theories about it,\n\n1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:52.500\n but much less so than the other agencies.\n\n1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:54.900\n CIA does a good job of playing to the mythos.\n\n1:00:54.900 --> 1:00:58.820\n So when General Petraeus used to be the director of CIA.\n\n1:00:58.820 --> 1:01:00.820\n Yeah, and your workout partner.\n\n1:01:00.820 --> 1:01:01.660\n And my workout partner.\n\n1:01:01.660 --> 1:01:02.480\n I read about this.\n\n1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:05.240\n So I loved and hated those workouts with Petraeus\n\n1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:07.900\n because he is a physical beast.\n\n1:01:07.900 --> 1:01:11.740\n He's a strong fit, at the time, 60 something year old man.\n\n1:01:11.740 --> 1:01:13.540\n Let me take a tangent on that because he's coming\n\n1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:14.380\n on this podcast.\n\n1:01:14.380 --> 1:01:15.340\n Oh, excellent man.\n\n1:01:15.340 --> 1:01:20.340\n So can you say what you learned from the man\n\n1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:25.180\n in terms of, or like what you think is interesting\n\n1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:28.340\n and powerful and inspiring about the way he sees the world,\n\n1:01:28.340 --> 1:01:31.780\n or maybe what you learned in terms of how to get strong\n\n1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:34.020\n in the gym or anything about life.\n\n1:01:34.020 --> 1:01:34.860\n Two things right away.\n\n1:01:34.860 --> 1:01:36.180\n And one of them I was gonna share with you anyway.\n\n1:01:36.180 --> 1:01:37.500\n So I'm glad that you asked the question.\n\n1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:42.500\n So the first is that on our runs and man, he runs fast\n\n1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:45.700\n and we would go for six mile runs through Bangkok.\n\n1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:50.300\n And he talked openly about, I asked him,\n\n1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:56.380\n how do you keep this mystery, this epic mythology\n\n1:01:57.980 --> 1:02:00.480\n about your fitness and your strength?\n\n1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:04.760\n How do you keep all of this alive with the troops?\n\n1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.620\n And he had this amazing answer.\n\n1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:08.740\n And he was like, I don't talk about it.\n\n1:02:08.740 --> 1:02:13.400\n Myths are born not from somebody orchestrating the myth,\n\n1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:17.000\n but from the source of the myth, simply being secretive.\n\n1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.700\n So he's like, I don't talk about it.\n\n1:02:18.700 --> 1:02:19.900\n I've never talked about it.\n\n1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:21.220\n I've never exacerbated it.\n\n1:02:21.220 --> 1:02:22.580\n I just do what I do.\n\n1:02:22.580 --> 1:02:23.980\n And I let the troops talk.\n\n1:02:23.980 --> 1:02:26.380\n And he's like, when it's in favor, when it goes in favor\n\n1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:30.820\n of discipline and loyalty and commitment, I let it run.\n\n1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:33.420\n If it starts getting destructive or damaging,\n\n1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:37.900\n then I have my leadership team step in to fix it.\n\n1:02:37.900 --> 1:02:40.460\n But when it comes to the mythos,\n\n1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:42.980\n the myth of him being superpowered soldier,\n\n1:02:42.980 --> 1:02:44.440\n that's what he wants every soldier to be.\n\n1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:45.720\n So he lets it run.\n\n1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:48.940\n And it was so enlightening when he told me,\n\n1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:51.420\n when there's a myth that benefits you, you just let it go.\n\n1:02:51.420 --> 1:02:54.260\n You let it happen because it gets you further\n\n1:02:54.260 --> 1:02:55.200\n without you doing any work.\n\n1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:56.040\n It costs no investment for you.\n\n1:02:56.040 --> 1:02:58.500\n So the catalyst of the virality of the myth\n\n1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:00.500\n is just being mysterious.\n\n1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:02.020\n And that's what CIA does well,\n\n1:03:02.020 --> 1:03:03.260\n to go back to your first question.\n\n1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:04.700\n What does CIA do?\n\n1:03:04.700 --> 1:03:06.540\n They don't answer any questions.\n\n1:03:06.540 --> 1:03:08.300\n They don't say anything.\n\n1:03:08.300 --> 1:03:11.020\n And wherever the myth goes, the myth goes,\n\n1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:13.100\n whether it's that they sold drugs\n\n1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:14.860\n or use child prostitutes or whatever else,\n\n1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:17.120\n wherever the myth goes, they let it go.\n\n1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:18.860\n Because at the end of the day,\n\n1:03:18.860 --> 1:03:22.220\n everybody sits back and says, wow, I really just don't know.\n\n1:03:22.220 --> 1:03:23.820\n Now, the second thing that I learned from Petraeus,\n\n1:03:23.820 --> 1:03:27.140\n and I really am a big fan of Petraeus.\n\n1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:29.100\n I know he made personal mistakes.\n\n1:03:29.100 --> 1:03:30.580\n You don't get to be that powerful\n\n1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:32.180\n without making personal mistakes.\n\n1:03:32.180 --> 1:03:33.460\n But when I worked out with him,\n\n1:03:33.460 --> 1:03:38.460\n the one thing that my commanding officer\n\n1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:39.900\n told me not to ask about,\n\n1:03:39.900 --> 1:03:43.240\n he was like, never ask the general about his family.\n\n1:03:44.180 --> 1:03:45.240\n I'm a family guy.\n\n1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:48.140\n So as soon as I met General Petraeus,\n\n1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.940\n one of the first things I asked him was,\n\n1:03:49.940 --> 1:03:51.720\n hey, what was it like raising a family\n\n1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:55.300\n and being the commander of forces in the Middle East?\n\n1:03:55.300 --> 1:03:57.100\n Like you weren't with your family very much.\n\n1:03:57.100 --> 1:03:59.060\n And the thing I love about the guy,\n\n1:03:59.060 --> 1:04:00.420\n he didn't bite off my head.\n\n1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:01.260\n He didn't snap at me.\n\n1:04:01.260 --> 1:04:02.380\n He didn't do anything.\n\n1:04:02.380 --> 1:04:04.780\n He openly admitted that he regretted\n\n1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:06.660\n some of the decisions that he made\n\n1:04:06.660 --> 1:04:11.180\n because he had to sacrifice his family to get there.\n\n1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:13.620\n Relationships with his children,\n\n1:04:13.620 --> 1:04:15.580\n absentee father, missing birthdays,\n\n1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:19.140\n missing, we all say, we all say how sad it is\n\n1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:20.540\n to miss birthdays and miss anniversaries,\n\n1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:21.380\n yada, yada, yada.\n\n1:04:21.380 --> 1:04:22.200\n Everybody knows what that feels like.\n\n1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:23.940\n Even business people know what that feels like.\n\n1:04:23.940 --> 1:04:26.040\n The actual pain that we're talking about\n\n1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:28.300\n is when you're not there to handle\n\n1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:31.660\n your 13 year old's questions when a boy breaks up with her\n\n1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:34.540\n or when you're not there to handle the bloody lip\n\n1:04:34.540 --> 1:04:35.940\n that your nine year old comes back with\n\n1:04:35.940 --> 1:04:37.940\n from their first encounter with a bully.\n\n1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:39.780\n Those are the truly heartbreaking moments\n\n1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:42.380\n that a parent lives and dies by.\n\n1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:45.620\n He missed almost all of those\n\n1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:48.260\n because he was fighting a war that we forgot\n\n1:04:48.260 --> 1:04:50.260\n and we gave up on 20 years later, right?\n\n1:04:51.580 --> 1:04:53.300\n He's so honest about that.\n\n1:04:54.220 --> 1:04:57.040\n And it was really inspiring to me\n\n1:04:57.040 --> 1:04:59.180\n to be told not to ask that question.\n\n1:04:59.180 --> 1:05:02.940\n And when I broke that guidance, he didn't reprimand me.\n\n1:05:02.940 --> 1:05:05.600\n He just, he was authentic.\n\n1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:07.480\n And it was absolutely one of the big decisions\n\n1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:10.620\n that helped me leave CIA on my own in 2014.\n\n1:05:10.620 --> 1:05:15.100\n And he was honest on the sacrifice you make.\n\n1:05:15.100 --> 1:05:17.800\n The same man, the same man who just taught me a lesson\n\n1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:21.500\n about letting a myth live,\n\n1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:24.460\n that same guy was willing to be so authentic\n\n1:05:24.460 --> 1:05:27.980\n about this personal mistake.\n\n1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:30.860\n I like complicated people like that.\n\n1:05:30.860 --> 1:05:34.460\n So what did you, what do you make of that calculation,\n\n1:05:34.460 --> 1:05:36.580\n of family versus job?\n\n1:05:36.580 --> 1:05:40.740\n You've given a lot of your life and passion\n\n1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:42.720\n to the CIA, to that work.\n\n1:05:44.420 --> 1:05:49.080\n You've spoken positively about that world, the good it does.\n\n1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:53.960\n And yet you're also a family man and you value that.\n\n1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:55.220\n What's that calculation like?\n\n1:05:55.220 --> 1:05:56.140\n What's that trade off like?\n\n1:05:56.140 --> 1:05:57.860\n I mean, for me, the calculation is very clear.\n\n1:05:57.860 --> 1:05:58.780\n It's family.\n\n1:05:58.780 --> 1:06:03.220\n I left CIA because I chose my family.\n\n1:06:03.220 --> 1:06:06.540\n And when my son was born, my wife and I found out\n\n1:06:06.540 --> 1:06:08.340\n that we were pregnant while we were still on mission.\n\n1:06:08.340 --> 1:06:09.260\n We were a tandem couple.\n\n1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:12.620\n My wife is also a former CIA officer, undercover like me.\n\n1:06:12.620 --> 1:06:14.940\n We were operating together overseas.\n\n1:06:14.940 --> 1:06:18.780\n We got the positive pregnancy test, like so many people do.\n\n1:06:18.780 --> 1:06:21.780\n And she cried.\n\n1:06:21.780 --> 1:06:23.280\n My wife was a bad ass.\n\n1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.340\n I was just, I was like the accidental spy,\n\n1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:28.300\n but my wife was really good at what she does.\n\n1:06:28.300 --> 1:06:32.260\n And she cried and she was like, what do we do now?\n\n1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:34.860\n It's what we've always wanted, a child,\n\n1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:37.820\n but we're in this thing right now.\n\n1:06:38.860 --> 1:06:41.220\n There's no space for a child.\n\n1:06:41.220 --> 1:06:45.620\n So long story short, we had our baby.\n\n1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:48.020\n CIA brought us back to have the baby.\n\n1:06:48.020 --> 1:06:50.560\n And when we started having conversations about,\n\n1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:52.140\n hey, what do we do next?\n\n1:06:52.140 --> 1:06:53.500\n Cause we're not the type of people\n\n1:06:53.500 --> 1:06:57.580\n to wanna just sit around and be domestic.\n\n1:06:57.580 --> 1:06:58.780\n What do we do next?\n\n1:06:58.780 --> 1:07:00.900\n But keep in mind, we have a child now.\n\n1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:02.600\n So here's some of our suggestions.\n\n1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:04.100\n We could do this and we can do that.\n\n1:07:04.100 --> 1:07:06.300\n Let us get our child to a place where we can put him\n\n1:07:06.300 --> 1:07:07.300\n into an international school,\n\n1:07:07.300 --> 1:07:10.460\n or we can get him into some sort of program\n\n1:07:10.460 --> 1:07:15.460\n where we can both operate together again during the day.\n\n1:07:17.260 --> 1:07:18.460\n But CIA just had no,\n\n1:07:18.460 --> 1:07:19.900\n they had no patience for that conversation.\n\n1:07:19.900 --> 1:07:23.860\n There was no, family is not their priority.\n\n1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:26.100\n So the fact that we were a tandem couple,\n\n1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:29.060\n two officers, two operators trying to have a baby\n\n1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:30.620\n was irrelevant to them.\n\n1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:32.700\n So when they didn't play with us,\n\n1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:37.700\n when they did nothing to help us prioritize parenthood\n\n1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:41.460\n as part of our overall experience,\n\n1:07:41.460 --> 1:07:43.100\n that's when we knew that they never would.\n\n1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:46.500\n And what good is it to commit yourself to a career\n\n1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:48.220\n if the career is always going to challenge\n\n1:07:48.220 --> 1:07:50.160\n the thing that you value most?\n\n1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:53.580\n And that was the calculation that we made to leave CIA.\n\n1:07:53.580 --> 1:07:55.820\n Not everybody makes that calculation.\n\n1:07:55.820 --> 1:08:00.340\n And a big part of why I am so vocal about my time in CIA\n\n1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:05.340\n is because I am immensely appreciative of the men and women\n\n1:08:05.420 --> 1:08:09.780\n who to this day have failed marriages\n\n1:08:09.780 --> 1:08:12.100\n and poor relationships with their children\n\n1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:14.220\n because they chose national security.\n\n1:08:14.220 --> 1:08:17.380\n They chose protecting America over their own family.\n\n1:08:17.380 --> 1:08:21.020\n And they've done it even though it's made them\n\n1:08:21.020 --> 1:08:23.580\n abuse alcohol and abuse substances\n\n1:08:23.580 --> 1:08:25.380\n and they've gotten themselves,\n\n1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:29.120\n they've got permanent diseases and issues\n\n1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:31.420\n from living and working abroad.\n\n1:08:31.420 --> 1:08:35.400\n It's just insane the sacrifice that officers make\n\n1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:37.560\n to keep America free.\n\n1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:39.340\n And I'm just not one of those people.\n\n1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:40.180\n I chose family.\n\n1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:44.360\n You said that your wife misses it.\n\n1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:45.200\n Do you miss it?\n\n1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:46.040\n We both miss it.\n\n1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:47.620\n We miss it for different reasons.\n\n1:08:47.620 --> 1:08:49.460\n We miss it for similar reasons, I guess,\n\n1:08:49.460 --> 1:08:50.900\n but we miss it in different ways.\n\n1:08:50.900 --> 1:08:55.340\n The people, the people at CIA are just amazing.\n\n1:08:55.340 --> 1:09:00.340\n They're everyday people like the guy and the gal next door,\n\n1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:04.940\n but so smart and so dedicated and so courageous\n\n1:09:04.940 --> 1:09:06.860\n about what they do and how they do it.\n\n1:09:06.860 --> 1:09:08.960\n I mean, the sacrifices they make are massive,\n\n1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:10.720\n more massive than the sacrifices I made.\n\n1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:12.140\n So I was always inspired\n\n1:09:12.140 --> 1:09:13.700\n and impressed by the people around me.\n\n1:09:13.700 --> 1:09:16.640\n So both my wife and I absolutely miss the people.\n\n1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:20.360\n My wife misses the work because you know everything.\n\n1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:25.220\n When you're inside, it's all, I mean, we had top secret.\n\n1:09:25.220 --> 1:09:27.140\n We had TS SCI clearances at the time.\n\n1:09:27.140 --> 1:09:30.440\n I had a cat six, cat 12, which makes me nuclear cleared.\n\n1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:32.820\n My wife had other privy clearances\n\n1:09:32.820 --> 1:09:37.300\n that allowed her to look into areas that were specialized,\n\n1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:40.920\n but there wasn't a headline that went out\n\n1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:44.220\n that we couldn't fact check with a click of a few buttons.\n\n1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:46.260\n And she misses that because she loved that kind of knowledge.\n\n1:09:46.260 --> 1:09:48.940\n And now you're just one of us living\n\n1:09:48.940 --> 1:09:51.900\n in the cloud of mystery.\n\n1:09:51.900 --> 1:09:52.740\n Exactly.\n\n1:09:52.740 --> 1:09:54.380\n Not really knowing anything about what's going on.\n\n1:09:54.380 --> 1:09:55.620\n Exactly, but for me,\n\n1:09:55.620 --> 1:09:59.060\n I've always been the person that likes operating.\n\n1:09:59.060 --> 1:10:01.020\n And you know what you still get to do when you leave CIA?\n\n1:10:01.020 --> 1:10:02.460\n You still get to operate.\n\n1:10:02.460 --> 1:10:04.340\n Operating is just working with people.\n\n1:10:04.340 --> 1:10:06.180\n It's understanding how people think,\n\n1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:07.180\n predicting their actions,\n\n1:10:07.180 --> 1:10:10.440\n driving their direction of their thoughts, persuading them,\n\n1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:11.740\n winning negotiations.\n\n1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:14.060\n You still get to do that.\n\n1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:15.460\n You do that every day.\n\n1:10:15.460 --> 1:10:18.540\n And you can apply that in all kinds of domains.\n\n1:10:18.540 --> 1:10:21.020\n Well, let me ask you on that.\n\n1:10:21.020 --> 1:10:25.980\n You're a covert CIA intelligence officer for several years.\n\n1:10:25.980 --> 1:10:28.660\n Maybe can you tell me the story of how it all began?\n\n1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:30.700\n How were you recruited?\n\n1:10:30.700 --> 1:10:32.580\n And what did the job entail\n\n1:10:32.580 --> 1:10:34.240\n to the degree you can speak about it?\n\n1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:36.140\n Feel free to direct me if I'm getting too boring\n\n1:10:36.140 --> 1:10:37.460\n or if the camera.\n\n1:10:37.460 --> 1:10:40.780\n Every aspect of this is super exciting.\n\n1:10:40.780 --> 1:10:45.780\n So I was leaving the United States Air Force in 2007.\n\n1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:51.220\n I was a lieutenant getting ready to pin on captain.\n\n1:10:51.220 --> 1:10:53.020\n My five years was up.\n\n1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:56.260\n And I was a very bad fit for the US Air Force.\n\n1:10:56.260 --> 1:10:58.900\n I was an Air Force Academy graduate, not by choice,\n\n1:10:58.900 --> 1:11:01.820\n but by lack of opportunity, lack of options otherwise.\n\n1:11:01.820 --> 1:11:03.740\n So I forced myself through the Academy,\n\n1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:07.140\n barely graduated with a 2.4 GPA.\n\n1:11:07.140 --> 1:11:09.420\n And then went on the Air Force taught me how to fly.\n\n1:11:09.420 --> 1:11:11.960\n And then the Air Force taught me about nuclear weapons.\n\n1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:16.960\n And I ended up as a nuclear missile commander in Montana.\n\n1:11:18.300 --> 1:11:20.820\n And I chose to leave the Air Force\n\n1:11:20.820 --> 1:11:23.200\n because I didn't like shaving my face.\n\n1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:24.260\n I didn't like having short hair.\n\n1:11:24.260 --> 1:11:26.260\n And I most definitely didn't like shining my shoes.\n\n1:11:26.260 --> 1:11:28.180\n And I did not wanna be one of the people\n\n1:11:28.180 --> 1:11:29.340\n in charge of nuclear weapons.\n\n1:11:29.340 --> 1:11:30.680\n So when I found myself as a person\n\n1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:32.980\n in charge of 200 nuclear weapons,\n\n1:11:32.980 --> 1:11:34.620\n I knew that I was going down the wrong road.\n\n1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:36.180\n I have questions about this.\n\n1:11:36.180 --> 1:11:38.420\n And more importantly, I have questions about your hair.\n\n1:11:38.420 --> 1:11:40.300\n So you had short hair at the time?\n\n1:11:40.300 --> 1:11:41.460\n I had, yeah, you have to.\n\n1:11:41.460 --> 1:11:42.980\n Military regulations, you can't have hair\n\n1:11:42.980 --> 1:11:43.980\n longer than one inch.\n\n1:11:43.980 --> 1:11:44.820\n Okay.\n\n1:11:44.820 --> 1:11:48.940\n And this, the beautiful hair you have now,\n\n1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:52.140\n that came to be in the CIA or after?\n\n1:11:52.140 --> 1:11:55.380\n This, so I discovered I had messy hair in CIA\n\n1:11:55.380 --> 1:11:58.540\n because I used to go muge, we called it muge.\n\n1:11:58.540 --> 1:12:00.340\n I used to go Mujahideen style,\n\n1:12:00.340 --> 1:12:03.320\n big burly beard and crazy wacky hair.\n\n1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:06.420\n Because an ambiguously brown guy with a big beard\n\n1:12:06.420 --> 1:12:09.460\n and long hair can go anywhere in the world\n\n1:12:09.460 --> 1:12:12.220\n without anyone even noticing him.\n\n1:12:12.220 --> 1:12:14.580\n They either think that he's a janitor\n\n1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:18.860\n or they think that he's like some forgotten part of history\n\n1:12:18.860 --> 1:12:21.620\n but nobody ever thinks that that guy is a spy.\n\n1:12:21.620 --> 1:12:23.620\n So it was the perfect, for me,\n\n1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:27.700\n it was one of my favorite disguises.\n\n1:12:27.700 --> 1:12:29.140\n It's what's known as a level two disguise.\n\n1:12:29.140 --> 1:12:30.500\n One of my favorite disguises to Don\n\n1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:33.920\n was just dilapidated brown guy.\n\n1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:37.700\n Can you actually, we'll just take a million tangents.\n\n1:12:37.700 --> 1:12:39.540\n What's a level two disguise?\n\n1:12:40.460 --> 1:12:42.940\n What are the different levels of disguise?\n\n1:12:42.940 --> 1:12:44.140\n What are the disguises?\n\n1:12:44.140 --> 1:12:46.660\n Yeah, there's three levels of disguise by and large.\n\n1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:48.460\n Level one is what we also know,\n\n1:12:48.460 --> 1:12:49.900\n what we also call light disguise.\n\n1:12:49.900 --> 1:12:52.900\n So that's essentially, you put on sunglasses\n\n1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:55.060\n and a ball cap and that's a disguise.\n\n1:12:55.060 --> 1:12:57.360\n You look different than you normally look.\n\n1:12:57.360 --> 1:12:59.680\n So it's just different enough\n\n1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:01.360\n that someone who's never seen you before,\n\n1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:02.980\n someone who literally has to see you\n\n1:13:02.980 --> 1:13:05.100\n just from a picture on the internet,\n\n1:13:05.100 --> 1:13:06.460\n they may not recognize you.\n\n1:13:06.460 --> 1:13:08.060\n It's why you see celebrities walk around\n\n1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:11.900\n with ball caps and oversized jackets and baseball hats\n\n1:13:11.900 --> 1:13:12.860\n because they just need to not look\n\n1:13:12.860 --> 1:13:13.900\n like they look in the tabloid\n\n1:13:13.900 --> 1:13:16.340\n or not look like they look in TV.\n\n1:13:16.340 --> 1:13:17.940\n That's level one.\n\n1:13:17.940 --> 1:13:19.840\n Let me jump from level one to level three.\n\n1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.300\n Level three is all of your prosthetics,\n\n1:13:22.300 --> 1:13:24.740\n all the stuff you see in Mission Impossible,\n\n1:13:24.740 --> 1:13:28.720\n your fake ears, your fake faces, your fat suits,\n\n1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.380\n your stilts inside your feet, all that's level three.\n\n1:13:32.380 --> 1:13:35.860\n Whenever they make any kind of prosthetic disguise,\n\n1:13:35.860 --> 1:13:37.060\n that's a level three disguise\n\n1:13:37.060 --> 1:13:41.300\n because prosthetics are very damning\n\n1:13:41.300 --> 1:13:43.060\n if you are caught with a prosthetic.\n\n1:13:43.060 --> 1:13:45.260\n If you're caught wearing a sudden,\n\n1:13:45.260 --> 1:13:47.220\n wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses,\n\n1:13:47.220 --> 1:13:49.460\n nobody's gonna say you're a spy.\n\n1:13:49.460 --> 1:13:54.100\n But when you're caught with a custom made nose prosthetic\n\n1:13:54.100 --> 1:13:55.480\n that changes the way your face looks\n\n1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:57.660\n or when someone pops out a fake jaw\n\n1:13:57.660 --> 1:14:00.900\n and they see that your top teeth don't look like they did\n\n1:14:00.900 --> 1:14:03.340\n in this prosthetic, then all of a sudden\n\n1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:05.660\n you've got some very difficult questions to ask\n\n1:14:05.660 --> 1:14:06.700\n or to answer.\n\n1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:08.480\n So level three is extremely dangerous.\n\n1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:09.540\n Level one is not dangerous.\n\n1:14:09.540 --> 1:14:12.380\n Level two is longterm disguise.\n\n1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:14.220\n Level two is all the things that you can do\n\n1:14:14.220 --> 1:14:16.160\n to permanently change the way you look\n\n1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:17.740\n for a long period of time\n\n1:14:17.740 --> 1:14:20.440\n so that whether you're aggressed in the street\n\n1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:23.540\n or whether someone breaks into your hotel room or whatever,\n\n1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:24.720\n it's real.\n\n1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:27.300\n So maybe that's, maybe you get a tattoo.\n\n1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:28.860\n Maybe you cut your hair short.\n\n1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:29.780\n Maybe you grow your hair long.\n\n1:14:29.780 --> 1:14:31.120\n Maybe you go bald.\n\n1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:32.540\n Maybe you start wearing glasses.\n\n1:14:32.540 --> 1:14:34.120\n Well, glasses are technically a prosthetic,\n\n1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:38.240\n but you can, if you have teeth pulled,\n\n1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:42.220\n if you gain 20 pounds, really gain 20 pounds\n\n1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:44.300\n or lose 15 pounds, whatever you might do,\n\n1:14:44.300 --> 1:14:45.580\n all of that's considered level two.\n\n1:14:45.580 --> 1:14:48.420\n It's designed for a longterm mission\n\n1:14:48.420 --> 1:14:52.060\n so that people believe you are who you say you are\n\n1:14:52.060 --> 1:14:53.100\n in that disguise.\n\n1:14:53.100 --> 1:14:55.920\n A lot of that is physical characteristics.\n\n1:14:55.920 --> 1:14:59.700\n What about what actors do,\n\n1:14:59.700 --> 1:15:01.260\n which is the...\n\n1:15:01.260 --> 1:15:02.100\n Method acting.\n\n1:15:02.100 --> 1:15:03.020\n Yeah, the method acting,\n\n1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:07.160\n sort of developing a backstory in your own mind,\n\n1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:11.460\n and then you start pretending\n\n1:15:11.460 --> 1:15:15.900\n that you host a podcast and teach at a university\n\n1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:17.980\n and then do research and so on\n\n1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:19.980\n just so that people can believe\n\n1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:22.860\n that you're not actually an agent.\n\n1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:24.700\n Is that part of the disguise levels or no?\n\n1:15:24.700 --> 1:15:28.180\n So yes, disguise has to do with physical character traits.\n\n1:15:28.180 --> 1:15:29.580\n That's what a disguise is.\n\n1:15:29.580 --> 1:15:32.260\n What you're talking about is known as a cover legend.\n\n1:15:32.260 --> 1:15:33.480\n When you go undercover,\n\n1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:35.620\n what you claim to be, who you claim to be,\n\n1:15:35.620 --> 1:15:38.180\n that's called your legend, your cover legend.\n\n1:15:38.180 --> 1:15:40.580\n Every disguise would theoretically have\n\n1:15:40.580 --> 1:15:42.380\n its own cover legend.\n\n1:15:42.380 --> 1:15:43.660\n Even if it's just to describe\n\n1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:45.300\n why you're wearing what you're wearing,\n\n1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:47.100\n it's all a cover.\n\n1:15:47.100 --> 1:15:48.900\n So the method acting,\n\n1:15:48.900 --> 1:15:50.460\n this is a fantastic point\n\n1:15:50.460 --> 1:15:51.460\n that I don't get to make very often,\n\n1:15:51.460 --> 1:15:52.780\n so I'm glad you asked.\n\n1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:55.300\n The difference between CIA officers in the field\n\n1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:56.540\n and method actors\n\n1:15:56.540 --> 1:15:59.940\n is that method actors try to become the character.\n\n1:15:59.940 --> 1:16:04.280\n They try to shed all vestiges of who they really are\n\n1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:05.900\n and become the character,\n\n1:16:05.900 --> 1:16:07.460\n and that's part of what makes them so amazing,\n\n1:16:07.460 --> 1:16:12.200\n but it's also part of what makes them mentally unstable\n\n1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:13.140\n over long periods of time.\n\n1:16:13.140 --> 1:16:14.660\n It's part of what feeds their depression,\n\n1:16:14.660 --> 1:16:16.500\n their anxiety, their personal issues,\n\n1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:18.920\n because they lose sight of who they really are.\n\n1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:20.760\n Field officers don't get that luxury.\n\n1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:24.460\n We have to always, always remember\n\n1:16:24.460 --> 1:16:26.940\n we are a covert CIA intelligence officer\n\n1:16:26.940 --> 1:16:28.620\n collecting secrets in the field.\n\n1:16:28.620 --> 1:16:29.900\n We have to remember that.\n\n1:16:29.900 --> 1:16:32.420\n So we're taught a very specific skill\n\n1:16:32.420 --> 1:16:36.920\n to compartmentalize our true self separately,\n\n1:16:38.020 --> 1:16:42.780\n but make that true self the true identity.\n\n1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:44.620\n So then we can still live and act\n\n1:16:44.620 --> 1:16:47.860\n and effectively carry out our cover legend\n\n1:16:47.860 --> 1:16:49.900\n without ever losing sight,\n\n1:16:49.900 --> 1:16:51.980\n without ever losing that compass true north\n\n1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:53.580\n of who we actually are.\n\n1:16:53.580 --> 1:16:55.140\n And then we can compartmentalize\n\n1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:56.860\n and secure all the information that we need,\n\n1:16:56.860 --> 1:16:58.260\n retain it, remember it,\n\n1:16:58.260 --> 1:17:00.420\n but then return to our true self\n\n1:17:00.420 --> 1:17:03.180\n when we get back to a position of safety.\n\n1:17:03.180 --> 1:17:04.420\n Is it possible to do that?\n\n1:17:04.420 --> 1:17:09.260\n So I just have kind of anecdotal evidence for myself.\n\n1:17:09.260 --> 1:17:12.300\n I really try to be the exact same person in all conditions,\n\n1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:13.860\n which makes it very easy.\n\n1:17:15.100 --> 1:17:17.220\n Like if you're not lying,\n\n1:17:17.220 --> 1:17:21.340\n it makes it very easy to, first of all, to exist,\n\n1:17:21.340 --> 1:17:23.900\n but also to communicate a kind of authenticity\n\n1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:26.460\n and a genuineness, which I think is really important.\n\n1:17:26.460 --> 1:17:29.180\n Like trust and integrity around trust\n\n1:17:29.180 --> 1:17:30.420\n is extremely important to me.\n\n1:17:30.420 --> 1:17:32.380\n It's the thing that opens doors\n\n1:17:32.380 --> 1:17:34.780\n and maintains relationships.\n\n1:17:34.780 --> 1:17:39.380\n And I tend to think, like when I was in Ukraine,\n\n1:17:39.380 --> 1:17:44.380\n so many doors just opened to the very high security areas\n\n1:17:45.140 --> 1:17:46.120\n and everywhere else too.\n\n1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:48.940\n Like I've just interacted with some incredible people\n\n1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:51.780\n without any kind of concerns.\n\n1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:52.980\n You know, who is this guy?\n\n1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:54.180\n Is he gonna spread it?\n\n1:17:54.180 --> 1:17:55.180\n You know, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:17:55.180 --> 1:17:58.180\n And I tend to believe that you're able\n\n1:17:58.180 --> 1:18:00.860\n to communicate a trustworthiness somehow\n\n1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:05.060\n if you just are who you are.\n\n1:18:05.060 --> 1:18:07.180\n And I think, I suppose method actors\n\n1:18:07.180 --> 1:18:09.300\n are trying to achieve that by becoming something\n\n1:18:09.300 --> 1:18:14.300\n and they can, I just feel like there is very subtle cues\n\n1:18:14.300 --> 1:18:16.920\n that are extremely difficult to fake.\n\n1:18:17.860 --> 1:18:22.060\n Like you really have to become that person, be that person.\n\n1:18:22.060 --> 1:18:25.060\n But you're saying as a CIA agent,\n\n1:18:25.060 --> 1:18:27.720\n you have to remember that you are there\n\n1:18:27.720 --> 1:18:29.100\n to collect information.\n\n1:18:29.100 --> 1:18:31.100\n Do you think that gives you away?\n\n1:18:31.100 --> 1:18:33.920\n So one of the flaws in your argument\n\n1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:38.200\n is that you keep referring to how you feel.\n\n1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:40.420\n I feel this, I feel that, I feel like this,\n\n1:18:40.420 --> 1:18:41.600\n I feel like that.\n\n1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:45.860\n That feeling is a predictable character trait\n\n1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:46.760\n of all human beings.\n\n1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:49.060\n It's a pink matter, we call it pink matter.\n\n1:18:49.060 --> 1:18:50.900\n It's a cognitive trait.\n\n1:18:52.580 --> 1:18:55.020\n You are not alone in trusting your feelings.\n\n1:18:55.020 --> 1:18:56.780\n All people trust their feelings.\n\n1:18:56.780 --> 1:18:59.620\n But because what CIA teaches us\n\n1:18:59.620 --> 1:19:03.340\n is how to systematically create artificial relationships\n\n1:19:04.340 --> 1:19:06.380\n where we're the one in control of the source\n\n1:19:06.380 --> 1:19:08.440\n that is giving us intelligence.\n\n1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:11.680\n And the core element to being able to control\n\n1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:13.020\n a relationship is understanding\n\n1:19:13.020 --> 1:19:14.940\n the pink matter truth of feelings.\n\n1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:19.900\n What all people feel becomes their point of view\n\n1:19:19.900 --> 1:19:21.460\n on what reality is.\n\n1:19:21.460 --> 1:19:23.380\n So when you understand and you learn how to manipulate\n\n1:19:23.380 --> 1:19:26.320\n what people feel, then you can essentially direct them\n\n1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:28.340\n to feel any way you want them to feel.\n\n1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:30.800\n So if you want them to feel like they can trust you,\n\n1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:32.140\n you can make them feel that way.\n\n1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:34.240\n If you want them to feel like you're a good guy\n\n1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.400\n or a bad guy, if you want them to feel like\n\n1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:38.180\n they should give you secrets even though their government\n\n1:19:38.180 --> 1:19:40.020\n tells them not to, you can do that.\n\n1:19:40.020 --> 1:19:43.220\n There are men who make women feel like they love them\n\n1:19:43.220 --> 1:19:45.180\n and just so that the woman will sleep with them.\n\n1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:47.460\n There are women who make men feel like they love them\n\n1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:49.620\n just so the men will give them their money.\n\n1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:52.860\n Manipulation is a core behavioral trait\n\n1:19:52.860 --> 1:19:55.820\n of all the human species because we all understand\n\n1:19:55.820 --> 1:19:58.200\n to some level how powerful feelings are,\n\n1:19:58.200 --> 1:19:59.540\n but feelings are not the same thing\n\n1:19:59.540 --> 1:20:01.220\n as logical, rational thought.\n\n1:20:01.220 --> 1:20:03.400\n They're two different sides of the brain.\n\n1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:07.500\n What CIA teaches us how to do is systematically tap into\n\n1:20:07.500 --> 1:20:10.080\n the right side, emotional side of the brain\n\n1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:13.660\n so that we can quickly get past all of the stuff\n\n1:20:13.660 --> 1:20:15.420\n you were just saying, all of the,\n\n1:20:15.420 --> 1:20:16.700\n well, don't you have to be convincing\n\n1:20:16.700 --> 1:20:18.140\n and don't you have to really know your story\n\n1:20:18.140 --> 1:20:20.380\n and don't you have to be able to defend it?\n\n1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:21.640\n Don't you have to have authenticity\n\n1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:25.820\n and don't you have to have genuine feelings?\n\n1:20:25.820 --> 1:20:27.600\n Yes, all of those things are true\n\n1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:29.820\n if you're having a genuine relationship,\n\n1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:31.300\n but in an artificial relationship,\n\n1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:32.800\n there's ways to bypass all of that\n\n1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:34.280\n and get right to the heart of making someone\n\n1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.400\n feel comfortable and safe.\n\n1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:37.680\n I guess the question I'm asking\n\n1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:41.500\n and the thing I was implying is that creating\n\n1:20:41.500 --> 1:20:45.480\n an artificial relationship is an extremely difficult skill\n\n1:20:45.480 --> 1:20:50.480\n to accomplish the level, like how good I am at being me\n\n1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:56.340\n and creating a feeling in another person that I create.\n\n1:20:56.340 --> 1:20:58.260\n For you to do that artificially,\n\n1:20:58.260 --> 1:21:00.400\n that's gotta be, you gotta be,\n\n1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:03.700\n my sense is you gotta be really damn good at that kind of thing.\n\n1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:08.060\n I would venture to say, I mean,\n\n1:21:08.060 --> 1:21:10.100\n I don't know how to measure how difficult the thing is,\n\n1:21:10.100 --> 1:21:13.980\n but especially when you're communicating with people\n\n1:21:13.980 --> 1:21:18.640\n whose job depends on forming trusting relationships,\n\n1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:20.240\n they're gonna smell bullshit.\n\n1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:26.640\n And to get past that bullshit detector is tough.\n\n1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:28.420\n It's a tough skill.\n\n1:21:28.420 --> 1:21:29.260\n Well, it's interesting.\n\n1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:30.980\n So I would say that.\n\n1:21:30.980 --> 1:21:32.700\n Or maybe I'm wrong actually on that.\n\n1:21:32.700 --> 1:21:34.640\n I would say that once you understand the system,\n\n1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:35.540\n it's not that hard.\n\n1:21:35.540 --> 1:21:37.060\n It makes a lot of sense.\n\n1:21:37.060 --> 1:21:39.620\n But I would also say that to your exact point,\n\n1:21:39.620 --> 1:21:42.180\n you are right that people smell bullshit.\n\n1:21:42.180 --> 1:21:43.780\n People smell bullshit.\n\n1:21:43.780 --> 1:21:45.120\n But here's the thing.\n\n1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:48.020\n If you come in smelling like goat shit,\n\n1:21:48.900 --> 1:21:51.860\n you still smell like shit, but you don't smell like bullshit.\n\n1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:53.820\n So they don't count you out right away.\n\n1:21:53.820 --> 1:21:57.100\n And if you come in smelling like rotten tomatoes\n\n1:21:57.100 --> 1:21:59.300\n or if you come in smelling like lavender\n\n1:21:59.300 --> 1:22:00.580\n or if you come in smelling like vanilla\n\n1:22:00.580 --> 1:22:02.460\n or if you come in without any smell at all,\n\n1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:05.700\n all that matters is that you don't smell like bullshit.\n\n1:22:05.700 --> 1:22:10.540\n Here's the thing that's one of the secret sauces of CIA.\n\n1:22:10.540 --> 1:22:14.200\n When you look and act like a spy, people think you're a spy.\n\n1:22:14.200 --> 1:22:16.080\n If you look and act in any other way,\n\n1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:18.240\n you know what they never ever think you are?\n\n1:22:19.620 --> 1:22:21.060\n A spy.\n\n1:22:21.060 --> 1:22:22.220\n They might think you're an idiot.\n\n1:22:22.220 --> 1:22:24.940\n They might think you're trailer trash.\n\n1:22:24.940 --> 1:22:27.700\n They might think that you're a migrant worker,\n\n1:22:27.700 --> 1:22:30.820\n but they never think you're a spy.\n\n1:22:30.820 --> 1:22:35.540\n And that lesson in everyday life is immensely powerful.\n\n1:22:35.540 --> 1:22:39.700\n If you're trying to take your boss's job,\n\n1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:41.740\n as long as you don't ever look like the employee\n\n1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:43.300\n who's trying to take the boss's job,\n\n1:22:43.300 --> 1:22:44.860\n the boss is focused on all the employees\n\n1:22:44.860 --> 1:22:46.640\n who are trying to take his job.\n\n1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:48.980\n Everybody's prioritizing whether they know it or not.\n\n1:22:48.980 --> 1:22:51.820\n The goal is to just not be the one that they're targeting.\n\n1:22:51.820 --> 1:22:54.100\n Target them without them knowing you're targeting them.\n\n1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:58.180\n So people just, when they meet you, they put you in a bin.\n\n1:22:58.180 --> 1:23:01.020\n And if you want to avoid being put in a particular bin,\n\n1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:04.060\n just don't act like the person that would be,\n\n1:23:04.060 --> 1:23:06.180\n just show some kind of characteristics\n\n1:23:06.180 --> 1:23:07.420\n that bin you in some other way.\n\n1:23:07.420 --> 1:23:08.260\n Exactly right.\n\n1:23:08.260 --> 1:23:09.540\n You have to be in a bin.\n\n1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:10.980\n Just choose the bin.\n\n1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:12.300\n All right.\n\n1:23:12.300 --> 1:23:16.860\n So you, knowing these methods,\n\n1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:19.140\n when you talk to people, especially in civilian life,\n\n1:23:19.140 --> 1:23:22.740\n how do you know who's lying to you and not?\n\n1:23:22.740 --> 1:23:26.620\n That gets to be more into the trained skill side of things.\n\n1:23:26.620 --> 1:23:29.920\n There's body cues, there's micro expressions.\n\n1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:31.500\n I'm not a big fan of,\n\n1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.940\n I don't believe that micro expressions alone do anything.\n\n1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:35.660\n I also don't believe that micro expressions\n\n1:23:35.660 --> 1:23:37.840\n without an effective baseline do anything.\n\n1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:40.180\n So don't for a second think that I'm,\n\n1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:41.620\n all the people out there pitching\n\n1:23:41.620 --> 1:23:43.080\n that you can tell if someone's lying to you\n\n1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:46.080\n just by looking at their face, it's all baloney.\n\n1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:47.660\n In my world, that's baloney.\n\n1:23:47.660 --> 1:23:49.980\n Like the way you move your eyes or something like that.\n\n1:23:49.980 --> 1:23:51.820\n Without knowing a baseline, without knowing.\n\n1:23:51.820 --> 1:23:53.500\n For that individual. For that individual.\n\n1:23:53.500 --> 1:23:54.420\n Then you actually don't know.\n\n1:23:54.420 --> 1:23:56.540\n And an individual's baseline is based on education,\n\n1:23:56.540 --> 1:23:58.360\n culture, life experience, you name it, right?\n\n1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:00.160\n So this is huge.\n\n1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:03.480\n But when you combine facial expressions\n\n1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:06.900\n with body movements, body language, nonverbal cues,\n\n1:24:06.900 --> 1:24:10.540\n and you add on top of that effective elicitation techniques\n\n1:24:10.540 --> 1:24:12.100\n that you are in control of,\n\n1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:15.320\n now you have a more robust platform\n\n1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:16.500\n to tell if someone's lying to you.\n\n1:24:16.500 --> 1:24:21.500\n So there's like a set of like interrogation trajectories\n\n1:24:22.460 --> 1:24:26.200\n you can go down that can help you figure out a person.\n\n1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:30.420\n Technically they're interview, interview concepts.\n\n1:24:30.420 --> 1:24:31.260\n Correct.\n\n1:24:31.260 --> 1:24:32.260\n Because an interrogation,\n\n1:24:32.260 --> 1:24:33.700\n an interrogation is something very different\n\n1:24:33.700 --> 1:24:34.520\n than an interview.\n\n1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:36.160\n And in the world of professionals,\n\n1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:37.380\n an interrogation is very different.\n\n1:24:37.380 --> 1:24:38.300\n What's the difference?\n\n1:24:38.300 --> 1:24:40.860\n The nature of how relaxed the thing is or what?\n\n1:24:40.860 --> 1:24:44.100\n So in an interrogation, there's a clear pattern of dominance.\n\n1:24:44.100 --> 1:24:45.620\n There's no equality.\n\n1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:47.260\n Also, there's no escape.\n\n1:24:47.260 --> 1:24:49.900\n You are there until the interrogator is done with you.\n\n1:24:49.900 --> 1:24:51.820\n Anybody who's ever been reprimanded by mom and dad\n\n1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:53.160\n knows what an interrogation feels like.\n\n1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:54.860\n Anybody who's ever been called into the principal's office\n\n1:24:54.860 --> 1:24:55.980\n or the boss's office,\n\n1:24:55.980 --> 1:24:57.220\n that's what interrogation feels like.\n\n1:24:57.220 --> 1:24:59.580\n You don't leave until the boss says you can leave.\n\n1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:00.420\n And you're there to say,\n\n1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:02.840\n it's to answer questions the boss asks questions.\n\n1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:05.700\n An interview is an equal exchange of ideas.\n\n1:25:05.700 --> 1:25:09.660\n You are in control of this interview, for sure.\n\n1:25:09.660 --> 1:25:11.540\n But if we were having coffee,\n\n1:25:11.540 --> 1:25:13.420\n I could take control if I wanted to take control.\n\n1:25:13.420 --> 1:25:15.140\n If I wanted to ask you personal questions, I would.\n\n1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:17.620\n If I wanted to talk to you about your background, I could.\n\n1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:19.420\n Why am I in control of this interview exactly?\n\n1:25:19.420 --> 1:25:20.580\n Because the person in control\n\n1:25:20.580 --> 1:25:22.100\n is the person asking questions.\n\n1:25:22.100 --> 1:25:25.860\n I'm sitting here, as you've spoken about,\n\n1:25:26.900 --> 1:25:29.780\n my power here is I'm the quiet one listening.\n\n1:25:30.820 --> 1:25:31.660\n You're exactly right.\n\n1:25:31.660 --> 1:25:33.740\n Guess where this conversation goes?\n\n1:25:33.740 --> 1:25:35.140\n Anywhere you choose to take it,\n\n1:25:35.140 --> 1:25:36.620\n because you're the one asking questions.\n\n1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:38.300\n Every time I answer a question,\n\n1:25:38.300 --> 1:25:41.680\n I am creating a pattern of obedience to you,\n\n1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:43.300\n which subliminally, subconsciously,\n\n1:25:43.300 --> 1:25:45.780\n makes me that much more apt to answer your questions.\n\n1:25:45.780 --> 1:25:48.820\n Of course, you can always turn and start asking me questions.\n\n1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:53.820\n But you're saying that through conversation,\n\n1:25:53.900 --> 1:25:55.540\n you can call it interviewing,\n\n1:25:55.540 --> 1:25:59.820\n you can start to see cracks\n\n1:26:02.740 --> 1:26:05.580\n in the story of the person\n\n1:26:05.580 --> 1:26:08.500\n and the degree to which they exaggerate or lie\n\n1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:13.060\n or to see how much they can be trusted, that kind of stuff.\n\n1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:15.020\n What I'm saying is that through a conversation,\n\n1:26:15.020 --> 1:26:16.740\n you develop a baseline.\n\n1:26:16.740 --> 1:26:20.140\n Even just in the first part of our conversation,\n\n1:26:20.140 --> 1:26:23.140\n I've been able to create some baseline elements about you.\n\n1:26:23.140 --> 1:26:25.580\n You've been able to create baseline elements about me.\n\n1:26:25.580 --> 1:26:27.620\n Maybe they're just not a friend of mine.\n\n1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:28.900\n From those baselines,\n\n1:26:28.900 --> 1:26:33.060\n now we can push through more intentional questions\n\n1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:36.980\n to test whether or not the person is being truthful\n\n1:26:36.980 --> 1:26:39.100\n because they're operating within their baseline,\n\n1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:42.480\n or if you are triggering sensitivities\n\n1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:43.480\n outside of their baseline,\n\n1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:45.460\n and then you can start to see their tells.\n\n1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:46.300\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:26:46.300 --> 1:26:49.460\n Yeah, baseline, even the tells, right?\n\n1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:50.300\n The eye contact.\n\n1:26:50.300 --> 1:26:52.320\n You've probably already formed a baseline\n\n1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:54.580\n that I have trouble making eye contact.\n\n1:26:54.580 --> 1:26:56.900\n And so if you ask me difficult questions\n\n1:26:56.900 --> 1:26:58.300\n and I'm not making eye contact,\n\n1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:01.140\n maybe that's not a good signal of me lying or whatever.\n\n1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:01.980\n Correct.\n\n1:27:01.980 --> 1:27:04.140\n Because I always have trouble making eye contact,\n\n1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:04.980\n stuff like that.\n\n1:27:04.980 --> 1:27:06.020\n That's really fascinating.\n\n1:27:06.020 --> 1:27:07.740\n The majority of your eye movement is to the right?\n\n1:27:07.740 --> 1:27:08.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:08.580 --> 1:27:10.300\n Your right, my left, right?\n\n1:27:10.300 --> 1:27:11.540\n Which is usually someone who's,\n\n1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:13.460\n if you ask micro expressionists,\n\n1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:15.620\n that's someone who's referencing fact.\n\n1:27:15.620 --> 1:27:16.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:16.460 --> 1:27:18.020\n That's not necessarily what's happening for you\n\n1:27:18.020 --> 1:27:19.780\n because you're pulling concepts out of the air.\n\n1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:20.620\n So it's also a place\n\n1:27:20.620 --> 1:27:22.060\n where you reference something other than fact.\n\n1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:24.020\n It's a place for you to find creativity.\n\n1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:25.420\n So if I just thought that you were lying\n\n1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:28.020\n because you look up and to the right, I would be wrong.\n\n1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:29.300\n That's so fascinating.\n\n1:27:29.300 --> 1:27:31.340\n And a lot of that has to do with like habits\n\n1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:33.100\n that are formed and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:27:33.100 --> 1:27:35.940\n or maybe some right hand, left hand type of situation.\n\n1:27:35.940 --> 1:27:36.860\n Right eye dominance.\n\n1:27:36.860 --> 1:27:37.700\n Yeah, right eye dominance.\n\n1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:39.060\n It's gonna make you look to the right.\n\n1:27:39.060 --> 1:27:40.800\n Is this a science or an art?\n\n1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:41.780\n It's a bit of both.\n\n1:27:41.780 --> 1:27:44.180\n I would say that like all good art,\n\n1:27:44.180 --> 1:27:47.460\n art is taught from a foundation of skills.\n\n1:27:47.460 --> 1:27:51.060\n And those skills are played,\n\n1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:53.660\n are taught in a very structured manner.\n\n1:27:53.660 --> 1:27:57.300\n And then the way that you use the skills after that,\n\n1:27:57.300 --> 1:27:59.460\n that's more of the artistic grace.\n\n1:27:59.460 --> 1:28:01.780\n So I've always called espionage an art.\n\n1:28:01.780 --> 1:28:03.500\n Spying is an art.\n\n1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:06.040\n Being able to hack human beings is an art,\n\n1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:08.260\n but it's all based in a foundation of science.\n\n1:28:08.260 --> 1:28:10.300\n You still have to learn how to mix the color palette\n\n1:28:10.300 --> 1:28:11.660\n and use certain brushes.\n\n1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:16.060\n Do you think of that as a kind of the study\n\n1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:17.540\n of human psychology?\n\n1:28:17.540 --> 1:28:20.460\n Is that what a psychologist does or a psychiatrist?\n\n1:28:20.460 --> 1:28:25.460\n What from this process have you learned about human nature?\n\n1:28:25.700 --> 1:28:26.660\n Human nature.\n\n1:28:26.660 --> 1:28:30.060\n I mean, I suppose the answer to that could be a book,\n\n1:28:30.060 --> 1:28:32.260\n but it probably will be a book.\n\n1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:33.300\n I'll save you that, yeah.\n\n1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:38.300\n But is there things that are surprising about human nature,\n\n1:28:38.300 --> 1:28:43.440\n surprising to us civilians that you could speak to?\n\n1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:46.800\n Yes, one thing is extremely surprising about human nature,\n\n1:28:47.900 --> 1:28:49.240\n which is funny, because that's not the answer\n\n1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:50.080\n I would have said.\n\n1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:52.880\n So I'm glad that you clarified this specific question.\n\n1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.900\n The thing that's surprising about human nature\n\n1:28:55.900 --> 1:29:00.900\n is that human beings long, like in their soul,\n\n1:29:02.780 --> 1:29:06.780\n there's like a painful longing to be with other people.\n\n1:29:06.780 --> 1:29:08.700\n And that's really surprising,\n\n1:29:08.700 --> 1:29:11.380\n because we all wanna pretend like we're strong.\n\n1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:14.020\n We all wanna pretend like we're independent.\n\n1:29:14.020 --> 1:29:18.760\n We all wanna pretend like we are the masters of our destiny.\n\n1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:22.100\n But what's truly consistent in all people\n\n1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:27.100\n is this longing to commune with others like us.\n\n1:29:29.260 --> 1:29:33.140\n My more practical answer about what I've learned\n\n1:29:33.140 --> 1:29:36.460\n to be the truth is that human nature is predictable.\n\n1:29:36.460 --> 1:29:38.860\n And that predictability is what gives people\n\n1:29:38.860 --> 1:29:41.760\n an incredible advantage over other people.\n\n1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:43.420\n But that's not the surprising piece.\n\n1:29:43.420 --> 1:29:45.060\n I mean, even when CIA taught me\n\n1:29:45.060 --> 1:29:47.420\n that human nature is predictable, it just made sense.\n\n1:29:47.420 --> 1:29:49.020\n I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.\n\n1:29:49.020 --> 1:29:52.620\n But what I never ever anticipated was\n\n1:29:52.620 --> 1:29:54.020\n no matter where I've been in the world,\n\n1:29:54.020 --> 1:29:54.980\n no matter who I've talked to,\n\n1:29:54.980 --> 1:29:59.260\n no matter what socioeconomic bracket is that longing,\n\n1:29:59.260 --> 1:30:00.980\n man, it hurts.\n\n1:30:00.980 --> 1:30:04.460\n Loneliness sucks, and togetherness feels good,\n\n1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:05.800\n even if you're together with someone\n\n1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:07.220\n you know isn't the right person.\n\n1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:09.260\n It still feels better than being alone.\n\n1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:11.460\n I mean, that's such a deep truth you speak to,\n\n1:30:11.460 --> 1:30:15.020\n and I could talk about that for a long time.\n\n1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:18.580\n There is, I mean, through these conversations in general,\n\n1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:20.560\n whether it's being recorded or not,\n\n1:30:21.900 --> 1:30:26.900\n I hunger to discover in the other person that longing.\n\n1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.020\n You strip away the other things,\n\n1:30:29.020 --> 1:30:32.300\n and then you share in the longing for that connection.\n\n1:30:32.300 --> 1:30:35.940\n And I particularly also have detected that in people\n\n1:30:38.620 --> 1:30:42.180\n from all walks of life, including people\n\n1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:47.180\n that others might identify as evil or hard,\n\n1:30:47.940 --> 1:30:52.600\n as completely cold, it's there.\n\n1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:53.440\n It's there.\n\n1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:56.980\n They've hardened themselves in their search,\n\n1:30:56.980 --> 1:30:59.140\n and who knows what dark place their brain is in,\n\n1:30:59.140 --> 1:31:03.620\n their heart is in, but that longing is still there.\n\n1:31:03.620 --> 1:31:06.260\n Even if it's an ember, it's there.\n\n1:31:06.260 --> 1:31:11.120\n It's the reason why in World War I and World War II,\n\n1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:13.900\n you know, enemy combatants still shared cigarettes\n\n1:31:13.900 --> 1:31:17.380\n on the front lines during periods of holidays\n\n1:31:17.380 --> 1:31:18.940\n or bad weather or whatever else,\n\n1:31:18.940 --> 1:31:22.900\n because that human connection, man, it triumphs over all.\n\n1:31:22.900 --> 1:31:27.900\n See, that's in part of what I refer to when I say love,\n\n1:31:27.900 --> 1:31:31.980\n because I feel like if political leaders\n\n1:31:31.980 --> 1:31:34.740\n and people in conflict at the small scale\n\n1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:39.740\n and the large scale were able to tune into that longing,\n\n1:31:42.300 --> 1:31:45.340\n to seek in each other that basic longing\n\n1:31:45.340 --> 1:31:49.460\n for human connection, a lot of problems could be solved.\n\n1:31:49.460 --> 1:31:52.980\n But of course, it's difficult,\n\n1:31:52.980 --> 1:31:56.000\n because it's a game of chicken.\n\n1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:59.640\n It's if you open yourself up to reveal\n\n1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:02.600\n that longing for connection with others,\n\n1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:03.760\n people can hurt you.\n\n1:32:03.760 --> 1:32:04.920\n Well, I would go a step farther,\n\n1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:08.920\n and I would say that taking the connection away,\n\n1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:13.920\n punishing, penalizing people by removing the connection\n\n1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:18.120\n is a powerful tool, and that's what we see.\n\n1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:20.000\n That's why we send people to jail.\n\n1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.320\n That's why we put economic sanctions on countries.\n\n1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:24.240\n That's why we ground our children\n\n1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:25.840\n and send them to their rooms.\n\n1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:27.560\n We are penalizing them.\n\n1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:31.400\n Whether we know it or not, we're using punitive damage\n\n1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:33.640\n by taking away that basic human connection,\n\n1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:36.440\n that longing for community.\n\n1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:40.440\n What was your recruitment process and training process\n\n1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:45.440\n and things you could speak to in the CIA?\n\n1:32:46.140 --> 1:32:50.000\n As I was leaving the Air Force, all that was on my mind,\n\n1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:52.560\n I don't know what you were like at 27,\n\n1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:54.960\n but I was a total tip shit at 27.\n\n1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:57.480\n I'm not much better now at 42, but.\n\n1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:58.320\n You and me, Bill.\n\n1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:03.320\n Yeah, but I was like, I just wanted to be anything\n\n1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:06.920\n other than a military officer,\n\n1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:09.480\n so I was actually in the process of applying\n\n1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:12.320\n to the Peace Corps through this thing called the internet,\n\n1:33:12.320 --> 1:33:16.000\n which was still fairly rudimentary in 2007.\n\n1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:18.680\n I had a computer lab that we went to,\n\n1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:20.160\n and it had 10 computers in it,\n\n1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:21.460\n and you had to log in and log out,\n\n1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:22.960\n and slow internet and everything else,\n\n1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:25.320\n but anyways, I was filling out an online application\n\n1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:28.040\n to go work in the US Peace Corps.\n\n1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:29.980\n I wanted to grow my hair out.\n\n1:33:29.980 --> 1:33:33.120\n I wanted to stop wearing shoes that were shiny.\n\n1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:35.120\n I wanted to meet a hippie chick\n\n1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:37.320\n and have hippie babies in the wild\n\n1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:40.480\n teaching Nigerian children how to read,\n\n1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:42.580\n so that was the path I was going down,\n\n1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:45.520\n and as I filled in all of my details,\n\n1:33:45.520 --> 1:33:47.360\n there came this page that popped up,\n\n1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:48.820\n and it was this blinking red page,\n\n1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:50.400\n and it said, stop here.\n\n1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:53.280\n You may qualify for other government positions.\n\n1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:55.460\n If you're willing to put your application\n\n1:33:55.460 --> 1:33:57.480\n on hold for 72 hours,\n\n1:33:57.480 --> 1:33:59.800\n that gives us a chance to reach out to you,\n\n1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:02.280\n so again, 27 year old dipshit.\n\n1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:05.080\n I was like, sure, I'll put myself on hold\n\n1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:07.440\n if I might qualify for other government opportunities,\n\n1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:09.520\n and then about a day later, I got a phone call\n\n1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:11.880\n from an almost unlisted number.\n\n1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:15.020\n It just said 703, which was very strange to see\n\n1:34:15.020 --> 1:34:18.640\n on my flip phone at the time, just one 703 area code,\n\n1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:23.360\n and I picked it up, and it was a person\n\n1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:25.160\n from Northern Virginia asking me\n\n1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:27.120\n if I would be telling me that I was qualified\n\n1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:29.540\n for a position in national security,\n\n1:34:29.540 --> 1:34:32.160\n and if I would be interested, they'll pay for my ticket\n\n1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:35.100\n and fly me up to Langley, Virginia.\n\n1:34:35.100 --> 1:34:36.560\n They didn't say CIA.\n\n1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:37.920\n They said Langley.\n\n1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:39.320\n I put one on one together, and I was like,\n\n1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:43.040\n maybe this is CIA, like, how cool is this?\n\n1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:44.400\n Or maybe this is all make believe,\n\n1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:46.160\n and this is totally fake, so either way,\n\n1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:47.600\n it doesn't hurt me at all to say yes.\n\n1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:50.480\n They already have my phone number, so yes, yes, yes,\n\n1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:52.080\n and then I remember thinking,\n\n1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:54.760\n there's no way that happened, and this isn't real,\n\n1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:57.560\n and then a day later, I got FedEx\n\n1:34:57.560 --> 1:35:00.160\n or an overnight delivery of an airplane ticket\n\n1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:03.240\n and a hotel reservation and a rental car reservation,\n\n1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:05.720\n and then I just kept doing the next thing,\n\n1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:07.880\n which I found out later on is a form of control.\n\n1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:10.560\n You just do the next thing that they tell you to do,\n\n1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:12.480\n and then before I knew it, I was interviewing\n\n1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:15.040\n in a nondescript building with a person\n\n1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:17.760\n who only told me their first name for a position\n\n1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:19.360\n with the National Clandestine Service.\n\n1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:21.280\n So you never really got a chance to think about it\n\n1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:23.080\n because there's small steps along the way,\n\n1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:24.640\n and it kind of just leads you,\n\n1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:29.920\n and maybe your personality is such that.\n\n1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:30.800\n That's an adventure.\n\n1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:34.320\n It's an adventure, and because it's one step at a time,\n\n1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:36.440\n you don't necessarily see the negative consequences\n\n1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:37.280\n of the adventure.\n\n1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:38.980\n You don't think about any of that.\n\n1:35:38.980 --> 1:35:41.680\n You're just stepping into the adventure.\n\n1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:42.520\n And it's easy.\n\n1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:43.680\n There's no work involved.\n\n1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:44.980\n Somebody else is doing all the work,\n\n1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:46.400\n telling me where to be and when.\n\n1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:48.320\n It's a lot like basic training in the military.\n\n1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:49.880\n Anybody who's ever been through basic training\n\n1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:52.240\n will tell you they hated the first few days,\n\n1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:54.540\n and then by the end, it was really comforting\n\n1:35:54.540 --> 1:35:56.440\n because you just did what you were told.\n\n1:35:56.440 --> 1:35:57.540\n They told you when to eat.\n\n1:35:57.540 --> 1:35:59.260\n They made the decision of what to eat,\n\n1:35:59.260 --> 1:36:01.280\n and then you just, you marched when they told you to march,\n\n1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:03.040\n shined your shoes when they told you to shine your shoes.\n\n1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:06.360\n Human beings love being told what to do.\n\n1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:08.760\n What about the training process\n\n1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:13.760\n for becoming a covert CIA agent?\n\n1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:19.000\n Yeah, so the interview process is.\n\n1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.080\n Yeah, the interview process, too.\n\n1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:22.640\n How rigorous was that?\n\n1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:23.840\n It was very rigorous.\n\n1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:26.100\n That was where it became difficult.\n\n1:36:26.100 --> 1:36:28.620\n Everything up to the first interview was easy,\n\n1:36:28.620 --> 1:36:30.320\n but there's three interviews,\n\n1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:31.600\n and some people are lucky enough\n\n1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:34.580\n to have four or five interviews if something goes wrong\n\n1:36:34.580 --> 1:36:37.640\n or something goes awry with the first few interviews.\n\n1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:40.000\n And again, this might be dated from what I went through,\n\n1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:43.400\n but during the interview process is when they start,\n\n1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:45.600\n they do your psychological evaluations.\n\n1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:50.600\n They do your, they do personality assessments.\n\n1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:53.080\n They do skills assessments.\n\n1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.640\n They'll start sending you back to wherever you're living\n\n1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:59.840\n with assignments, not intel assignments,\n\n1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:02.700\n but actual homework assignments.\n\n1:37:02.700 --> 1:37:05.460\n Write an essay about three parts of the world\n\n1:37:05.460 --> 1:37:08.080\n that you think will be most impacted\n\n1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:09.400\n in the next three to five years,\n\n1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:12.760\n or prioritize the top three strategic priorities\n\n1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:16.440\n for the United States and put it into 250 words\n\n1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:19.260\n or 2,500 words and whatever else,\n\n1:37:19.260 --> 1:37:21.200\n double spaced in this font, yada, yada, yada,\n\n1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:22.520\n like super specific stuff.\n\n1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:24.040\n It's kind of stressful,\n\n1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:26.040\n but it's just like going back to college again.\n\n1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:27.800\n So you go through all of those acts,\n\n1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:30.640\n and then you submit this stuff to some PO box\n\n1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:33.120\n that doesn't have anybody that's ever gonna respond to you,\n\n1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:34.240\n and then you hope.\n\n1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:36.280\n You just send it into the ether,\n\n1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:38.400\n and you hope that you sent it right.\n\n1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:40.080\n You hope that you wrote well enough.\n\n1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:42.440\n You hope that your assessment was right,\n\n1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:43.320\n whatever else it might be,\n\n1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:45.720\n and then eventually get another phone call that says,\n\n1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:46.800\n hey, we received your package.\n\n1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:49.520\n You've been moved to the next level of interview,\n\n1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:52.080\n and now we need you to go to this other nondescript building\n\n1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:53.560\n in this other nondescript city,\n\n1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:55.640\n and then you start meeting.\n\n1:37:55.640 --> 1:37:59.520\n You start sitting in waiting rooms\n\n1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:00.540\n with other groups of people\n\n1:38:00.540 --> 1:38:02.660\n who are at the same phase of interview with you,\n\n1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:04.520\n which were some of the coolest experiences\n\n1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:05.880\n that I remember still.\n\n1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:07.360\n One of my best friends to this day,\n\n1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:10.240\n who I don't get to talk to because he's still undercover,\n\n1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:12.240\n is a guy I met during those interview processes,\n\n1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:14.120\n and I was like, oh, we met.\n\n1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:14.960\n I saw what he was wearing.\n\n1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.800\n He saw what I was wearing.\n\n1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:17.620\n I was brown.\n\n1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:18.460\n So you immediately connected,\n\n1:38:18.460 --> 1:38:19.760\n and you liked the people there.\n\n1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:20.600\n Close.\n\n1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.600\n More like we immediately judge each other,\n\n1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:24.080\n because we're all untrained.\n\n1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:26.160\n So he looked at me, and he was like,\n\n1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:28.360\n brown dude with crazy hair, and I was wearing,\n\n1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:29.780\n dude, I was dressed like a total ass.\n\n1:38:29.780 --> 1:38:32.720\n I was dressed in a clubbing shirt.\n\n1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:33.880\n I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea\n\n1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:36.480\n to go to a CIA interview in a clubbing shirt\n\n1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:39.180\n with my buttons unbuttoned down to here.\n\n1:38:39.180 --> 1:38:40.560\n And he was like, yeah, you were really,\n\n1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:42.160\n after we got in, he was like,\n\n1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:43.760\n yeah, dude, you were always really cool to talk to,\n\n1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:46.760\n but I was like, there's no way that idiot's getting in.\n\n1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:48.020\n And I remember looking at him and being like,\n\n1:38:48.020 --> 1:38:50.200\n dude, you were just another white guy in a black suit.\n\n1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:52.560\n They're not looking for you, but here you are.\n\n1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:54.440\n So it was just, those kinds of things were so interesting,\n\n1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:55.400\n because we were totally wrong\n\n1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:56.840\n about what CIA was looking for.\n\n1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:59.920\n Until you're in, you have no idea what they're looking for.\n\n1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:02.640\n And you're just shooting in the dark.\n\n1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:05.880\n Did they have you do like a lie detector test?\n\n1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:07.400\n Yes, it's called a polygraph.\n\n1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:08.560\n Polygraph.\n\n1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:10.040\n How effective, just interesting,\n\n1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:12.840\n or our previous discussion, how effective are those?\n\n1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:14.080\n Polygraphs are really interesting.\n\n1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:16.440\n So one of the things that people don't understand\n\n1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:17.880\n about polygraphs is that polygraphs\n\n1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:19.440\n aren't meant to detect a lie.\n\n1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:21.400\n Like they're called a lie detector,\n\n1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:23.840\n but they're not actually meant to detect a lie.\n\n1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:27.280\n They're built to detect variants\n\n1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:29.680\n from your physiological baseline.\n\n1:39:29.680 --> 1:39:33.360\n So they're essentially meant to identify sensitivities\n\n1:39:33.360 --> 1:39:35.240\n to certain types of questions.\n\n1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:37.400\n And then as they identify a sensitivity to a question,\n\n1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:40.600\n it gives the interviewer an additional piece of information\n\n1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:43.020\n to direct the next round of questions.\n\n1:39:43.020 --> 1:39:44.520\n So then from there, they can kind of see\n\n1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:46.840\n how sensitive you are to a certain level of questions.\n\n1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:50.720\n And your sensitivity could be a sign of dishonesty,\n\n1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:54.520\n but it could also be a sign of vulnerability.\n\n1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:57.360\n So the interrogator themselves, the interviewer themselves,\n\n1:39:57.360 --> 1:39:59.880\n they're the one that have to make the judgment call\n\n1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:00.720\n as to which one it is,\n\n1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:03.580\n which is why you might see multiple interviewers\n\n1:40:03.580 --> 1:40:05.840\n over the course of multiple polygraphs.\n\n1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:07.400\n But that's really what they're all about.\n\n1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:11.280\n So, I mean, outside of, they're extremely uncomfortable,\n\n1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:13.360\n like they're mentally uncomfortable,\n\n1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:15.780\n but then there's also, you sit on a pad\n\n1:40:15.780 --> 1:40:17.280\n because the pad is supposed to be able to tell\n\n1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:20.920\n like your body movements, but also like your sphincter\n\n1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:22.200\n contractions or whatever.\n\n1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:24.560\n So you're sitting on this pad, you're plugged in,\n\n1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:26.280\n you're strapped in, you're tied up,\n\n1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:28.040\n and it takes so much time to get in there.\n\n1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:30.080\n And then they start asking you questions,\n\n1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:31.240\n baseline questions at first,\n\n1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:33.240\n and then other questions from there.\n\n1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:35.260\n And you're just answering the best you can.\n\n1:40:35.260 --> 1:40:36.320\n And you never know what they're seeing\n\n1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:37.160\n and you don't know what they're doing.\n\n1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:39.640\n And it's really hard not to get anxious of that anyways.\n\n1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:40.460\n And then...\n\n1:40:40.460 --> 1:40:42.360\n Are they the whole time monitoring the readings?\n\n1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:45.020\n Yeah, from like a big, they've got multiple screens\n\n1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:47.800\n and they've got just, it's all information superiority.\n\n1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:49.980\n They have information superiority.\n\n1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:51.440\n You're the idiot looking away from them\n\n1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:54.660\n or looking sideways of them and trying not to move\n\n1:40:54.660 --> 1:40:57.040\n because you're afraid that if you like have gas\n\n1:40:57.040 --> 1:40:57.880\n or if you move a little bit,\n\n1:40:57.880 --> 1:40:59.600\n it's gonna bury you from your baseline.\n\n1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.240\n And the whole time you're worried, your heart's racing\n\n1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:02.360\n and your blood pressure's increasing,\n\n1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:04.320\n which is a variance from baseline.\n\n1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:06.480\n So yeah, that means it's an interesting art.\n\n1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:07.640\n Or your baseline.\n\n1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:08.480\n Correct.\n\n1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:09.560\n Maybe there's some people that are just chilling\n\n1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:11.800\n the whole time and that's their baseline.\n\n1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:12.880\n Right, right.\n\n1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:14.020\n But that's what they're doing.\n\n1:41:14.020 --> 1:41:14.880\n They're establishing a baseline.\n\n1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:16.840\n I mean, I guess that means the polygraph\n\n1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:21.840\n is a skill that you develop to do it well.\n\n1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:24.380\n So when people talk about beating a lie detector,\n\n1:41:24.380 --> 1:41:26.200\n it's not that they're telling an effective lie.\n\n1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:27.040\n That's not hard.\n\n1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:30.220\n It's not hard to tell a lie to an interviewer.\n\n1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:32.280\n And the interviewer doesn't care\n\n1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:34.260\n if you're being honest or not honest about a topic.\n\n1:41:34.260 --> 1:41:36.760\n What they're looking for is sensitivity.\n\n1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:40.680\n If they see no sensitivity, that's a big sign for them.\n\n1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:43.500\n That's a big sign that you're probably a pathological liar.\n\n1:41:43.500 --> 1:41:46.880\n If you show sensitivity to many things,\n\n1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:49.280\n then that's a sign that you're probably an anxious person\n\n1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:51.640\n and they can still reset their baseline\n\n1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:53.680\n because they can tell how your anxiety\n\n1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:56.720\n is increasing in 15 minute increments.\n\n1:41:56.720 --> 1:41:58.520\n It's a unique skill.\n\n1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:02.000\n I mean, a really good polygrapher is immensely valuable.\n\n1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.160\n But yeah, it's the misnomers,\n\n1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:07.200\n the misconceptions about polygraphs are vast.\n\n1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:09.540\n You also mentioned personality tests.\n\n1:42:09.540 --> 1:42:10.920\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:14.000\n So how effective are personality tests?\n\n1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:15.360\n One for the hiring process,\n\n1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:17.320\n but also for understanding a human being.\n\n1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:19.820\n So personality is extremely important\n\n1:42:19.820 --> 1:42:20.800\n for understanding human being.\n\n1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:22.740\n And I would say that there's a thousand different ways\n\n1:42:22.740 --> 1:42:23.580\n of looking at personality.\n\n1:42:23.580 --> 1:42:28.080\n The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI.\n\n1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:30.500\n And the MBTI is what all the leading spy agencies\n\n1:42:30.500 --> 1:42:32.400\n around the world use as well.\n\n1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:34.000\n Well, that's kind of interesting to hear.\n\n1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:34.840\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:36.480\n So there's been criticisms of that kind of test.\n\n1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:38.360\n There have been criticisms for a long time.\n\n1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.200\n Yeah, and you think there's value.\n\n1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:41.400\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:43.140\n And there's a few reasons why, right?\n\n1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:45.520\n So first, MBTI makes the claim\n\n1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:49.240\n that your core personality doesn't change over time.\n\n1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:51.720\n And that's how it's calibrated.\n\n1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:53.280\n And one of the big arguments is that people say\n\n1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:55.720\n that your personality can change over time.\n\n1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:59.600\n Now, in my experience, the MBTI is exactly correct.\n\n1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:01.640\n Your core personality does not change\n\n1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:04.400\n because your core personality is defined\n\n1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:08.880\n as your personality when all resources are removed.\n\n1:43:08.880 --> 1:43:13.300\n So essentially, your emergency mode, your dire conditions,\n\n1:43:13.300 --> 1:43:15.580\n that is your core personality.\n\n1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:18.280\n We can all act a little more extroverted.\n\n1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:21.680\n We can all be a little more empathetic\n\n1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:25.040\n when we have tons of time and money and patience.\n\n1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:27.160\n When you strip away all that time, money, and patience,\n\n1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:28.700\n how empathetic are you?\n\n1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:31.320\n How much do you like being around other people?\n\n1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:33.040\n How much do you like being alone?\n\n1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:37.120\n Do you make judgments or do you analyze information?\n\n1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:38.840\n That's what's so powerful about MBTI\n\n1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:40.600\n is it's talking about what people are like\n\n1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:42.320\n when you strip away resources.\n\n1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:44.280\n And then because it's so consistent,\n\n1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:46.380\n it's also only four codes.\n\n1:43:46.380 --> 1:43:50.600\n It's super easy to be able to assess a human being\n\n1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:54.000\n through a dialogue, through a series of conversations,\n\n1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:57.420\n to be able to hone in with high accuracy\n\n1:43:57.420 --> 1:44:00.600\n what is there for letter code.\n\n1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:04.120\n There's only 16 options and it becomes extremely valuable.\n\n1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:08.600\n Is it perfectly precise and does everybody do it the same?\n\n1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:10.920\n I mean, those things are, the answers to those are no,\n\n1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:15.200\n but is it operationally useful in a short period of time?\n\n1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:18.240\n That is a resoundingly powerful yes.\n\n1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:20.360\n Yeah, I just, I only know, I think the first letter,\n\n1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:22.360\n it's introverted and extroverted, right?\n\n1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:25.500\n I've taken the test before,\n\n1:44:25.500 --> 1:44:27.640\n just like a crude version of the test\n\n1:44:27.640 --> 1:44:30.300\n and that's the same problem you have with IQ tests.\n\n1:44:30.300 --> 1:44:33.200\n There's the right thorough way of doing it\n\n1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:34.880\n and there's like fun internet way.\n\n1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:39.880\n And do you mind sharing what your personality?\n\n1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:43.840\n My type index?\n\n1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:44.680\n Yes.\n\n1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:46.800\n I'm an ENTP, that's an extrovert,\n\n1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:51.800\n intuitive, perceiver, thinker, ENT, thinker, P, perceiver.\n\n1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:59.200\n My wife is an ISFJ, which is the polar opposite of me.\n\n1:44:59.200 --> 1:45:01.280\n E, I'm extroverted, she's introverted,\n\n1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:05.200\n I'm an intuitor, she's a sensor, I'm a thinker,\n\n1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:07.520\n she's a feeler, I'm a perceiver, she's a judger.\n\n1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:10.640\n Is there good science on like longterm\n\n1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:13.880\n successful relationships in terms of the dynamics of that,\n\n1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:16.680\n the 16, I wonder if there's good data on this.\n\n1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:19.680\n I don't think there's a lot of good data\n\n1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:23.320\n in personalities writ large because there's not a lot\n\n1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:26.600\n of money to be made in personality testing,\n\n1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:31.600\n but I would say that with experience,\n\n1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:36.200\n with a good MBTI test, with a good paid test,\n\n1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:38.880\n a 400, 500 question test,\n\n1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:41.200\n once you understand your own code\n\n1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:44.920\n and then you're taught how to assess the code of others,\n\n1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:46.640\n with those two things kind of combined\n\n1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:48.800\n because then you have experience and learning,\n\n1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:53.800\n it becomes very useful and you can have high confidence\n\n1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:56.560\n in the conclusions that you reach about\n\n1:45:56.560 --> 1:45:59.960\n people's professions, about people's relationships\n\n1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:02.480\n with family, about people's relationships professionally,\n\n1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:05.080\n people's capabilities to deal with stress,\n\n1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:08.000\n how people will perform when pushed outside\n\n1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:10.460\n of their comfort zones, really, really powerful,\n\n1:46:10.460 --> 1:46:14.120\n useful stuff in corporate world and in the espionage world.\n\n1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:16.820\n So in terms of compressed representation\n\n1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:20.880\n of another human being, you can't do much better\n\n1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:21.960\n than those four letters.\n\n1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:23.240\n I don't believe you can do much better.\n\n1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:26.360\n In my experience, I have not seen anything better.\n\n1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:30.800\n Yeah, it is kind of, it's difficult to realize\n\n1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:32.080\n that there is a core personality\n\n1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:35.600\n or to the degree that's true, it seems to be true.\n\n1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:38.040\n It's even more difficult to realize\n\n1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:42.760\n that there is a stable, at least the science says so,\n\n1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:47.760\n a stable, consistent intelligence, unfortunately,\n\n1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:51.000\n you know, the G factor that they call,\n\n1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.260\n that if you do a barrage of IQ tests,\n\n1:46:53.260 --> 1:46:57.080\n that's going to consistently represent that G factor.\n\n1:46:57.080 --> 1:46:59.360\n And we're all born with that, we can't fix it.\n\n1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:01.900\n And that defines so much of who we are.\n\n1:47:01.900 --> 1:47:03.040\n It's sad.\n\n1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:06.280\n I don't see it as sad, because it's, for me,\n\n1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:08.960\n the faster you learn it, the faster you learn\n\n1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:13.960\n what your own sort of natural strengths and weaknesses are,\n\n1:47:14.060 --> 1:47:16.360\n the faster you get to stop wasting time\n\n1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:19.160\n on things that you're never gonna be good at,\n\n1:47:19.160 --> 1:47:21.120\n and you get to double down on the things\n\n1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:23.520\n that you're already naturally skilled or interested in.\n\n1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:26.560\n So there's always a silver lining to a cloud.\n\n1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:29.600\n But I know now that I will never be a ballerina\n\n1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:32.160\n or a ballerino, I know that I'll never be an artist,\n\n1:47:32.160 --> 1:47:35.260\n I'll never be a musician, I'll never be any of those things.\n\n1:47:35.260 --> 1:47:37.600\n And when I was 18, that might've made me sad,\n\n1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:40.600\n but now at 42, I'm like, well, shit, awesome.\n\n1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:44.120\n I can go be something else good instead of always being bad.\n\n1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:46.600\n You're not gonna be a ballerina, ballerino.\n\n1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:48.560\n Because I'm not graceful.\n\n1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:51.600\n And you've learned this through years of experience.\n\n1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:52.620\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:47:52.620 --> 1:47:55.000\n Well, I don't know if there's an MBTI equivalent\n\n1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:56.840\n for grace of movement.\n\n1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.840\n I think it's called S sensor.\n\n1:47:58.840 --> 1:47:59.680\n Oh, okay.\n\n1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:02.200\n Yeah, because a sensor is someone who's able\n\n1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:03.520\n to interact with the world around them\n\n1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:06.120\n through their five senses very effectively.\n\n1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:08.800\n Like if you talk to dancers, dancers can actually feel\n\n1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:10.720\n the grace in all of their muscles.\n\n1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:13.520\n They know what position their finger is in.\n\n1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:14.360\n I don't have any idea.\n\n1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:15.920\n I don't know what position my feet are in right now.\n\n1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:18.600\n I had to look to make sure I actually feel the floor right.\n\n1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:20.320\n Yeah, I definitely have.\n\n1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:21.360\n Oh, that's good to know.\n\n1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:25.640\n So I don't, I'm not a dancer, but I do have that.\n\n1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:27.360\n You're a musician, man.\n\n1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:29.760\n Well, the music, I don't know if that's for sure.\n\n1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:32.380\n Yeah, that's true that there is that physical component,\n\n1:48:32.380 --> 1:48:33.760\n but I think deeper,\n\n1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:35.860\n cause there's a technical aspect to that.\n\n1:48:35.860 --> 1:48:39.000\n That's just like, it's less about feel,\n\n1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.520\n but I do know jujitsu and grappling I've done all my life.\n\n1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:46.600\n I don't, you know, there's some people who are clumsy\n\n1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:47.680\n and they drop stuff all the time.\n\n1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:49.120\n They run into stuff.\n\n1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:51.920\n I don't, I don't, first of all, I don't know how that happens,\n\n1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:54.680\n but to me, I just have an awareness of stuff.\n\n1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:56.760\n Like if there's a little orientation.\n\n1:48:56.760 --> 1:49:00.520\n Yeah, like, like I know that there's a small object\n\n1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:03.760\n I have to step over and I have a good sense of that.\n\n1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:04.960\n It's so, it's so interesting.\n\n1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:06.440\n Yeah, you're just like born with that or something.\n\n1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:09.560\n My wife is brilliant and she still walks into doors.\n\n1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:10.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:11.800\n I mean, she'll walk in a doorway.\n\n1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:14.080\n She'll bang her knee on the same wall that's been there\n\n1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:15.280\n for the last 50 years.\n\n1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:17.280\n It's for some reason, really hilarious.\n\n1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:18.280\n That's good for me.\n\n1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:23.360\n You've been asked, I think on Reddit,\n\n1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:26.240\n are there big secrets that you know that could lend you\n\n1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:28.280\n and our country in terrible trouble\n\n1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.240\n if you came out to the public and you answered,\n\n1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:32.940\n yes, I wish I could forget them.\n\n1:49:32.940 --> 1:49:36.700\n So let me ask you just about secrecy in general.\n\n1:49:36.700 --> 1:49:39.160\n Are these secrets or just other secrets,\n\n1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:43.280\n ones that the public will never know\n\n1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:47.380\n or will it come out in 10, 20, 50 years?\n\n1:49:47.380 --> 1:49:49.560\n I guess the deeper question is,\n\n1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:53.520\n what is the value of secrecy and transparency?\n\n1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:56.880\n The standard classification\n\n1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:59.280\n for all human intelligence operations\n\n1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:03.340\n is something called two five X two, 25 by two.\n\n1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:07.680\n So 50 years, 25 years times two years or times two rounds.\n\n1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:11.280\n So in essence, anything that I've seen\n\n1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:15.120\n has the first chance of becoming public domain,\n\n1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.360\n declassified after 50 years,\n\n1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:19.880\n unless there's some congressional requirement\n\n1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:22.200\n for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier.\n\n1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:24.680\n So by then, I'll be 80 something years old\n\n1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:28.760\n or potentially dead, which is either way.\n\n1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:31.020\n That's when it can come out\n\n1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:34.240\n according to its typical classification.\n\n1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:39.040\n The value of secrets I have seen\n\n1:50:39.040 --> 1:50:42.820\n is that secrets create space.\n\n1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:48.520\n Secrets give opportunity for security.\n\n1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.740\n They give opportunity for thinking.\n\n1:50:50.740 --> 1:50:52.080\n They give space\n\n1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:55.100\n and space is an incredibly advantageous thing to have.\n\n1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:57.060\n If you know something somebody else doesn't know,\n\n1:50:57.060 --> 1:50:59.760\n even if it's just 15 or 20 minutes different,\n\n1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:02.600\n you can direct, you can change the course of fate.\n\n1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:05.400\n So I find secrets to be extremely valuable,\n\n1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:06.540\n extremely useful.\n\n1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:10.040\n Even at the place where secrets\n\n1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:12.360\n are being kept from a large mass,\n\n1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:15.520\n part of what all Americans need to understand\n\n1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:19.280\n is that one of the trade offs\n\n1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:23.920\n to building a system of government\n\n1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:26.740\n that allows us to be first world and wealthy\n\n1:51:26.740 --> 1:51:28.480\n and secure and successful,\n\n1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:30.680\n one of the trade offs is that we have given up\n\n1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:32.520\n a great deal of personal freedom.\n\n1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:34.680\n And one of the personal freedoms that we give up\n\n1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:39.000\n is the freedom of knowing what we wanna know.\n\n1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.460\n You get to know what the government tells you,\n\n1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:43.060\n you get to know what you need to know\n\n1:51:43.060 --> 1:51:44.400\n or what you've learned yourself,\n\n1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:47.000\n but you don't get to know secrets.\n\n1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.720\n People who do get to know secrets know them for a reason.\n\n1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:51.840\n That's why it's called a need to know.\n\n1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:54.480\n How difficult is it to maintain secrecy?\n\n1:51:54.480 --> 1:51:58.640\n It's surprisingly difficult as technology changes.\n\n1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:00.240\n It's also surprisingly difficult\n\n1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:05.240\n as our culture becomes one where people want notoriety.\n\n1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:09.440\n People wanna be the person who breaks the secret.\n\n1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:13.040\n 25 years ago, 40 years ago, that wasn't the case.\n\n1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:14.320\n There was a time in the United States\n\n1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:16.640\n where if someone gave you a secret,\n\n1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:20.020\n it was a point of personal honor not to share the secret.\n\n1:52:20.020 --> 1:52:22.560\n Now we're in a place where someone tells you a secret,\n\n1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.920\n like that could turn into a Twitter post\n\n1:52:24.920 --> 1:52:26.320\n that gets you a bunch of thumbs up\n\n1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:27.440\n and a bunch of likes or whatever else.\n\n1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:28.360\n An opportunity. Right.\n\n1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:31.160\n So the value of secrets has changed.\n\n1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:34.140\n And now there's almost a greater value on exposing secrets\n\n1:52:34.140 --> 1:52:36.260\n than there is on keeping secrets.\n\n1:52:36.260 --> 1:52:38.360\n That makes it difficult to keep secrets,\n\n1:52:38.360 --> 1:52:40.720\n especially when technology is going in the same direction.\n\n1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:43.080\n Yeah, where is the line?\n\n1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:45.040\n And by the way, I'm one of those old school people\n\n1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:46.000\n with the secrets.\n\n1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:51.000\n I think it's a karma thing.\n\n1:52:51.080 --> 1:52:52.920\n Again, back to the trust.\n\n1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:55.040\n I think in the short term you can benefit\n\n1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:57.240\n by sharing a secret.\n\n1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:00.260\n But in the long term, if people know they can trust you,\n\n1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:05.000\n like the juicy of the secret, it's a test of sorts.\n\n1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:07.840\n If they know you can keep that secret,\n\n1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:10.040\n that means you're somebody that could be trusted.\n\n1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:14.120\n And I believe that not just effectiveness in this life,\n\n1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:17.320\n but happiness in this life is informing a circle\n\n1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:18.640\n of people you can trust.\n\n1:53:18.640 --> 1:53:22.200\n Right, we're taught that secrets and lies are similar\n\n1:53:22.200 --> 1:53:24.260\n in that they have a limited shelf life.\n\n1:53:24.260 --> 1:53:26.340\n If you treat them like food,\n\n1:53:26.340 --> 1:53:29.160\n secrets and lies have a very limited shelf life.\n\n1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:33.080\n So if you cash in on them while they're still fresh,\n\n1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:35.700\n you beat them before they spoil.\n\n1:53:35.700 --> 1:53:38.040\n You get to take advantage of them before they spoil.\n\n1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:43.040\n However, trust has no limit to its shelf life.\n\n1:53:43.620 --> 1:53:46.380\n So it's almost like you're trading a short term victory\n\n1:53:46.380 --> 1:53:48.280\n and losing a long term victory.\n\n1:53:48.280 --> 1:53:50.540\n It's always better to keep the secret.\n\n1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:53.600\n It's always better to let the lie live\n\n1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:56.040\n because it will eventually come to light\n\n1:53:56.040 --> 1:53:57.920\n from somebody else, not from you,\n\n1:53:57.920 --> 1:53:59.800\n because it already has a limited shelf life.\n\n1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.520\n But what you win in exchange\n\n1:54:01.520 --> 1:54:03.600\n for not being the one that cashed in on the secret\n\n1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:05.480\n is immense trust.\n\n1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:12.520\n Let me ask you about lying and trust and so on.\n\n1:54:12.520 --> 1:54:15.620\n So I don't believe I've been contacted by\n\n1:54:15.620 --> 1:54:20.000\n or interacted with the CIA, the MI6, the FSB,\n\n1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.760\n Mossad or any other intelligence agency.\n\n1:54:22.760 --> 1:54:27.760\n I'm kind of offended, but would I know if I was?\n\n1:54:29.880 --> 1:54:31.320\n So from your perspective.\n\n1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:33.420\n No, you would not know if you were.\n\n1:54:33.420 --> 1:54:35.040\n For sure you've been on their radar.\n\n1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:36.620\n Absolutely, you've got a file.\n\n1:54:36.620 --> 1:54:38.080\n You've got a dossier somewhere.\n\n1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:39.560\n Why would I be on their radar?\n\n1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:40.480\n Because you're a.\n\n1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:41.480\n Who's interesting?\n\n1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:46.300\n It's not necessarily that you are interesting\n\n1:54:46.300 --> 1:54:48.920\n to someone as a foreign asset\n\n1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:51.680\n or an intelligence collection source,\n\n1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:54.480\n but your network is extremely interesting.\n\n1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:55.720\n The networks are important too.\n\n1:54:55.720 --> 1:54:57.840\n Correct, if someone had access to,\n\n1:54:57.840 --> 1:54:59.840\n if someone was able to clone your phone,\n\n1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:02.480\n every time you cross a border,\n\n1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:04.800\n you go through some sort of security.\n\n1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:06.460\n If you've ever been pulled into secondary\n\n1:55:06.460 --> 1:55:08.080\n and separated from your bag,\n\n1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:10.660\n that's exactly when and how people clone computers.\n\n1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:13.280\n They clone phones, they make whatever,\n\n1:55:13.280 --> 1:55:17.300\n photocopies of your old school planner,\n\n1:55:17.300 --> 1:55:18.400\n whatever it might be.\n\n1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:23.120\n But for sure you are an intelligence target.\n\n1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:24.840\n It just may be that you're not suitable\n\n1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:28.840\n to be a person who reports foreign intelligence.\n\n1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:30.880\n We've got to understand that all people\n\n1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:33.320\n are potential sources of valuable information\n\n1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:35.580\n to the national security infrastructure\n\n1:55:35.580 --> 1:55:38.960\n of our host country and any country that we visit.\n\n1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:41.480\n Someone like you with your public footprint,\n\n1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:43.880\n with your notoriety, with your educational background,\n\n1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:46.720\n with your national identifications\n\n1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:50.880\n becomes a viable and valuable target of information.\n\n1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:54.220\n Yeah, so to speak to that,\n\n1:55:56.160 --> 1:55:58.200\n I take security pretty seriously,\n\n1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:03.200\n but not to the degree that it runs my life,\n\n1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:05.880\n which I'm very careful about.\n\n1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:07.760\n That's good, I'm glad to hear that.\n\n1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:11.840\n So the moment you start to think about germs, right?\n\n1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:14.120\n Like you start to freak out\n\n1:56:14.120 --> 1:56:17.360\n and you become sort of paralyzed by the stress of it.\n\n1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:19.360\n So you have to balance those two things.\n\n1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:22.640\n If you think about all the things\n\n1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:24.000\n that could hurt you in this world\n\n1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:25.680\n and all the risk you could take,\n\n1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:29.200\n it can overwhelm your life.\n\n1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:32.640\n That said, the cyber world is a weird world\n\n1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:34.880\n because it doesn't have the same.\n\n1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:39.320\n I know not to cross the street without looking each way\n\n1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:41.640\n because there's a physical intuition about it.\n\n1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:45.040\n I'm not sure, I'm a computer science guy,\n\n1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:46.160\n so I have some intuition,\n\n1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:50.400\n but the cyber world, it's really hard\n\n1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:53.280\n to build up an intuition of what is safe and not.\n\n1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:56.560\n I've seen a lot of people just logging out\n\n1:56:56.560 --> 1:56:59.720\n of your devices all the time, like regularly.\n\n1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:01.760\n Just like that physical access step\n\n1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:03.360\n is a lot of people don't take.\n\n1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:07.920\n I can just like walk in into the offices of a lot of CEOs\n\n1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:10.680\n and it's like everything's wide open\n\n1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:13.480\n for physical access of those systems,\n\n1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:16.720\n which is kind of incredible for somebody,\n\n1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:18.440\n that sounds really shady, but it's not.\n\n1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:20.360\n I've written key loggers,\n\n1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:22.000\n like things that record everything you type\n\n1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:23.480\n in the mouse you move.\n\n1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:27.680\n And like I did that for, during my PhD,\n\n1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:30.120\n I was recording everything you do on your device\n\n1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:32.080\n and everything you do on your computer.\n\n1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:36.040\n People sign up to the study, they willingly do this\n\n1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:37.240\n to understand behavior.\n\n1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:38.440\n I was trying to use machine learning\n\n1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:42.160\n to identify who you are based on different biometric\n\n1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:44.840\n and behavioral things, which allows me\n\n1:57:44.840 --> 1:57:46.560\n to study human behavior and to see\n\n1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:49.520\n which is uniquely identifiable.\n\n1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:53.120\n And the goal there was to remove the need for a password.\n\n1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:56.080\n But how easy it is to write a thing\n\n1:57:56.080 --> 1:57:58.240\n that logs everything you type.\n\n1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:01.680\n I was like, wait a minute, like I can probably get\n\n1:58:01.680 --> 1:58:04.240\n a lot of people in the world to run this for me.\n\n1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:06.680\n I can then get all of their passwords.\n\n1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:10.840\n I mean, you could do so much,\n\n1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:15.840\n like I can run the entirety of the CIA from just myself.\n\n1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:17.640\n If I was, and I imagine there's a lot\n\n1:58:17.640 --> 1:58:20.240\n of really good hackers like that out there,\n\n1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:21.360\n much better than me.\n\n1:58:22.440 --> 1:58:25.800\n So I tried to prevent myself from being\n\n1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:28.360\n all the different low hanging fruit attack vectors\n\n1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:29.440\n in my life.\n\n1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:33.120\n I try to make it difficult to be that.\n\n1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.680\n But then I'm also aware that there's probably people\n\n1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:37.240\n that are like five steps ahead.\n\n1:58:38.240 --> 1:58:40.440\n You're doing the right thing.\n\n1:58:40.440 --> 1:58:44.240\n What I always advocate is the low hanging fruit\n\n1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:46.800\n is what keeps you from being a target of opportunity.\n\n1:58:46.800 --> 1:58:49.960\n Because you're half assed hackers,\n\n1:58:49.960 --> 1:58:53.280\n you're lazy hackers, you're unskilled hackers.\n\n1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:54.720\n They're looking for low hanging fruit.\n\n1:58:54.720 --> 1:58:57.240\n They're looking for the person who gets the Nigeria email\n\n1:58:57.240 --> 1:58:59.120\n about how you could be getting $5 million\n\n1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:00.480\n if you just give me your bank account.\n\n1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:01.320\n Exactly.\n\n1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:03.640\n That's what they're looking for.\n\n1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:05.400\n The thing that's scary is that if you're not\n\n1:59:05.400 --> 1:59:06.400\n a target of opportunity,\n\n1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:09.200\n if you become a intentional target,\n\n1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:11.840\n then there's almost nothing you can do.\n\n1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:14.520\n Because once you become an intentional target,\n\n1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:17.840\n then your security apparatus,\n\n1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:22.840\n they will create a dedicated customized way vector\n\n1:59:24.280 --> 1:59:27.240\n of attacking your specific security apparatus.\n\n1:59:27.240 --> 1:59:30.400\n And because security is always after, right?\n\n1:59:30.400 --> 1:59:32.960\n There's always, there's the leading advantage\n\n1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:34.960\n and the trailing advantage.\n\n1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:36.720\n When it comes to attacks,\n\n1:59:36.720 --> 1:59:38.280\n the leader always has the advantage\n\n1:59:38.280 --> 1:59:40.120\n because they have to create the attack\n\n1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:42.640\n before anybody else can create a way\n\n1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:44.240\n to protect against the attack.\n\n1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:45.640\n So the attack always comes first\n\n1:59:45.640 --> 1:59:47.040\n and that means they always have the advantage.\n\n1:59:47.040 --> 1:59:49.720\n You are always stuck just leaning on,\n\n1:59:49.720 --> 1:59:52.320\n this is the best security that I know of.\n\n1:59:52.320 --> 1:59:54.760\n Meanwhile, there's always somebody who can create a way\n\n1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:57.120\n of attacking the best security out there.\n\n1:59:57.120 --> 1:59:59.160\n And once they win, they have a monopoly.\n\n1:59:59.160 --> 2:00:02.680\n They have all that time until a new defensive countermeasure\n\n2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:04.120\n is deployed.\n\n2:00:04.120 --> 2:00:07.120\n Yeah, I tend to think exactly as you said,\n\n2:00:07.120 --> 2:00:09.760\n that the long hanging fruit protects against like,\n\n2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:11.760\n yeah, crimes of opportunity.\n\n2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:15.240\n And then I assume that people can just hack in\n\n2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:16.960\n if they really want.\n\n2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:19.000\n Think about how much anxiety we would be able to solve\n\n2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:21.480\n if everybody just accepted that.\n\n2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:22.960\n Well, there's several things you do.\n\n2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:26.800\n First of all, to be honest, it just makes me,\n\n2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:28.680\n it keeps me honest.\n\n2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:34.560\n Not to be a douchebag or like, not, yeah,\n\n2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:39.840\n to assume everything could be public.\n\n2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:44.600\n And so don't trade information that could hurt people\n\n2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:46.080\n if it was made public.\n\n2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:47.840\n So I try to do that.\n\n2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:52.280\n And the thing I try to make sure is I,\n\n2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:54.600\n like Home Alone style, try to.\n\n2:00:54.600 --> 2:00:55.480\n Booby trap.\n\n2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:59.720\n I really would like to know if I was hacked.\n\n2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:06.240\n And so I try to assume that I will be hacked and detect it.\n\n2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:07.160\n Have a tripwire or something.\n\n2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:10.400\n Yeah, a tripwire through everything.\n\n2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:13.440\n And not paranoid tripwise, just like open door.\n\n2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:17.520\n But I think that's probably the future of life on this earth\n\n2:01:17.520 --> 2:01:19.440\n is you're going, like everybody of interest\n\n2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:21.560\n is going to be hacked.\n\n2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:25.040\n That hopefully inspires, now this is outside of company.\n\n2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:25.960\n These are individuals.\n\n2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:30.120\n I mean, there is, of course, if you're actually operating,\n\n2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:31.480\n like I'm just a, who am I?\n\n2:01:31.480 --> 2:01:36.240\n I'm just a scientist person, podcasting person.\n\n2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:41.200\n So if I was actually running a company\n\n2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:46.720\n or was an integral part of some kind of military operation,\n\n2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:50.240\n then you probably have to have an entire team that's now\n\n2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:55.840\n doing that battle of trying to be ahead of the best hackers\n\n2:01:55.840 --> 2:01:57.440\n in the world that are attacking.\n\n2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:01.680\n But that requires a team that full time is their focus.\n\n2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:03.400\n And then you still get in trouble.\n\n2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:04.160\n Correct, yeah.\n\n2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:07.240\n So what I've seen as the norm, well, what I've seen\n\n2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:11.160\n is the cutting edge standard for corporations\n\n2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:16.880\n and the ultra wealthy and even intelligence organizations\n\n2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:19.240\n is that we have tripwires.\n\n2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:22.760\n It's better if you can't prevent from being hacked.\n\n2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:26.520\n The next best thing is to know as soon as you get hacked\n\n2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:30.280\n because then you can essentially terminate all the information.\n\n2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:31.880\n If you know it fast enough, you can just\n\n2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:32.880\n destroy the information.\n\n2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:34.320\n This is what the ultra wealthy do.\n\n2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:35.960\n They have multiple phones.\n\n2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:38.720\n So as soon as one phone gets hacked, the tripwire goes off.\n\n2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:40.600\n The operating system is totally deleted along\n\n2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:41.920\n with all data on the phone.\n\n2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:46.080\n And a second phone is turned on with a whole new separate set\n\n2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:47.400\n of metadata.\n\n2:02:47.400 --> 2:02:49.760\n And now for them, there's no break in service.\n\n2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.920\n It's just, oh, this phone went black.\n\n2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:54.080\n It's got a warning on it that says it was hacked.\n\n2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:55.440\n So trash it because they don't care\n\n2:02:55.440 --> 2:02:56.560\n about the price of the phone.\n\n2:02:56.560 --> 2:02:58.680\n Pick up the next phone, and we move on.\n\n2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:01.520\n That's the best thing that you can do essentially outside\n\n2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:04.000\n of trying to out hack the hackers.\n\n2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.520\n And then even in your intelligence and military\n\n2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:09.480\n worlds where cyber warfare is active,\n\n2:03:09.480 --> 2:03:12.120\n the people who are aggressing are not\n\n2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:16.400\n trying to create aggression that beats security.\n\n2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:19.240\n They're trying to find aggressive techniques,\n\n2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:22.440\n offensive techniques that have no security built around them\n\n2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:23.200\n yet.\n\n2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:25.960\n Because it's too cost and time intensive\n\n2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:28.760\n to protect against what you know is coming,\n\n2:03:28.760 --> 2:03:30.840\n it's so much more efficient and cost effective\n\n2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:32.760\n to go after new vectors.\n\n2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:37.760\n So it just becomes like, it becomes almost a silly game\n\n2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:41.240\n of your neighbor gets a guard dog.\n\n2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:43.040\n So you get a bigger guard dog.\n\n2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:45.040\n And then your neighbor gets a fence.\n\n2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:46.320\n So you're just constantly outdoing each other.\n\n2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:48.560\n It's called the security paradigm.\n\n2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:50.660\n People just, they just one up each other\n\n2:03:50.660 --> 2:03:53.060\n because it's never worth it to just get to the same level.\n\n2:03:53.060 --> 2:03:54.600\n You're always trying to outdo each other.\n\n2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:58.100\n Yeah, then maybe like banks have to fight that fight,\n\n2:03:58.100 --> 2:03:59.820\n but not everybody can.\n\n2:03:59.820 --> 2:04:00.660\n Right.\n\n2:04:00.660 --> 2:04:01.480\n Yeah, no.\n\n2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:03.280\n So you're saying I operated at the state of the art\n\n2:04:03.280 --> 2:04:04.120\n with the trip wires.\n\n2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:04.960\n This is good to know.\n\n2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:06.200\n Absolutely, man.\n\n2:04:06.200 --> 2:04:10.080\n And also just not using anybody else's services,\n\n2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:12.600\n doing everything myself.\n\n2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:14.340\n So that's harder to figure out what the heck\n\n2:04:14.340 --> 2:04:15.180\n this person is doing.\n\n2:04:15.180 --> 2:04:17.040\n Because if I'm using somebody else's service,\n\n2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:19.900\n like I did with QNAP,\n\n2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:24.480\n I have a QNAP NAS I use for cold storage\n\n2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:27.280\n of unimportant things, but a large videos.\n\n2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:29.700\n And I don't know if you know, but QNAP is a company\n\n2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:34.000\n that does NAS storage devices, and they got hacked.\n\n2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:38.800\n And everybody that didn't update as of a week ago\n\n2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:42.520\n from the point of the zero day hack, everybody got hacked.\n\n2:04:42.520 --> 2:04:46.180\n It's several thousand machines, and they asked,\n\n2:04:48.020 --> 2:04:50.560\n you can get your data back if you pay,\n\n2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:53.000\n I forget what it was, but it was,\n\n2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:55.360\n it was about a couple thousand dollars.\n\n2:04:55.360 --> 2:04:59.080\n And QNAP can get all the data back for their customers\n\n2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:01.080\n if they pay, I think, two million dollars.\n\n2:05:01.080 --> 2:05:01.960\n Wow.\n\n2:05:01.960 --> 2:05:04.560\n But that came from me relying on the systems\n\n2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:05.600\n of others for security.\n\n2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:10.600\n I assumed this company would have their security handled,\n\n2:05:10.600 --> 2:05:13.200\n but then that was a very valuable lesson to me.\n\n2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:18.200\n I now have layers of security and also an understanding\n\n2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:22.720\n which data is really important, which is somewhat important,\n\n2:05:22.720 --> 2:05:26.360\n which is not that important, and layering that all together.\n\n2:05:26.360 --> 2:05:28.880\n So just so you know, the US government, the military,\n\n2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:31.800\n woke up to that exact same thing about two years ago.\n\n2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:33.280\n It's still very new.\n\n2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:35.240\n I mean, they were sourcing,\n\n2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:37.400\n take night vision goggles, for example.\n\n2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:39.880\n They were sourcing components and engineering\n\n2:05:39.880 --> 2:05:41.560\n and blueprints for night vision goggles\n\n2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:43.880\n from three, four, five different subcontractors\n\n2:05:43.880 --> 2:05:47.040\n all over the country, but they never asked themselves\n\n2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:50.520\n what the security status was of those subcontractors.\n\n2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:55.520\n So fast forward a few years, and all of a sudden,\n\n2:05:55.920 --> 2:05:57.760\n they start getting faulty components.\n\n2:05:57.760 --> 2:05:59.920\n They start having night vision goggles that don't work.\n\n2:05:59.920 --> 2:06:01.960\n They start having supply chain issues\n\n2:06:01.960 --> 2:06:04.360\n where they have to change their provider,\n\n2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:07.640\n and the army doesn't know that the provider is changing.\n\n2:06:07.640 --> 2:06:09.180\n I mean, this is a strategy.\n\n2:06:09.180 --> 2:06:12.720\n The idea of going through third party systems\n\n2:06:12.720 --> 2:06:15.360\n is identifying the vulnerability in the supply chain.\n\n2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:20.000\n That's a savvy offensive practice\n\n2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:24.280\n for more than just cyber hackers.\n\n2:06:24.280 --> 2:06:26.560\n Let me ask you about physical hacking.\n\n2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:29.200\n So I'm now, like I'm an introvert,\n\n2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:31.360\n so I'm paranoid about all social interaction,\n\n2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:35.700\n but how much truth is there?\n\n2:06:35.700 --> 2:06:37.480\n It's kind of a funny question.\n\n2:06:37.480 --> 2:06:40.440\n How suspicious should I be when I'm traveling in Ukraine\n\n2:06:40.440 --> 2:06:42.000\n or different parts of the world\n\n2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.320\n when an attractive female walks up to me\n\n2:06:44.320 --> 2:06:46.880\n and shows any kind of attention?\n\n2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:49.900\n Is that like this kind of James Bond spy movie stuff,\n\n2:06:49.900 --> 2:06:54.020\n or is that kind of stuff used by intelligence agencies?\n\n2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:55.800\n I don't think it's used.\n\n2:06:55.800 --> 2:06:56.700\n It's absolutely used.\n\n2:06:56.700 --> 2:06:58.880\n It's called sexpionage.\n\n2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:02.680\n That's the term that we jokingly call it, is sexpionage.\n\n2:07:02.680 --> 2:07:05.940\n But yeah, the art of attraction, appeal,\n\n2:07:05.940 --> 2:07:10.940\n the manifestation of feelings through sexual manipulation,\n\n2:07:11.380 --> 2:07:14.320\n all of that is a super powerful tool.\n\n2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:15.740\n The Chinese use it extremely well.\n\n2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:18.020\n The Russians use it extremely well.\n\n2:07:18.020 --> 2:07:19.280\n In the United States,\n\n2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:23.100\n we actively train our officers not to use it\n\n2:07:23.100 --> 2:07:26.680\n because in the end it leads to complications\n\n2:07:26.680 --> 2:07:28.380\n in how you professionally run a case.\n\n2:07:28.380 --> 2:07:30.100\n So we train our officers not to use it.\n\n2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:33.340\n However, you can't control what other people think.\n\n2:07:33.340 --> 2:07:34.700\n So if you're an attractive male\n\n2:07:34.700 --> 2:07:36.060\n or an attractive female officer,\n\n2:07:36.060 --> 2:07:40.420\n and you're trying to talk to an older general\n\n2:07:40.420 --> 2:07:43.300\n who just happens to be gay or happens to be straight\n\n2:07:43.300 --> 2:07:44.620\n and is attracted to you,\n\n2:07:44.620 --> 2:07:45.940\n of course they're gonna be that much more willing\n\n2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:48.840\n to talk to an American who is also attractive.\n\n2:07:48.840 --> 2:07:50.740\n So it's hard to walk that back.\n\n2:07:50.740 --> 2:07:51.620\n In all definitions.\n\n2:07:51.620 --> 2:07:54.300\n So it could be all elements of charisma.\n\n2:07:56.220 --> 2:08:00.940\n So attractiveness in a dynamic sense of the word.\n\n2:08:00.940 --> 2:08:02.140\n So it's visual attractiveness,\n\n2:08:02.140 --> 2:08:05.660\n but the smile, the humor, the wit, the flirting,\n\n2:08:05.660 --> 2:08:07.720\n all that kind of stuff that could be used\n\n2:08:07.720 --> 2:08:10.740\n to the art of conversation.\n\n2:08:10.740 --> 2:08:12.500\n There's also elements of sexuality\n\n2:08:12.500 --> 2:08:14.740\n that people underestimate, right?\n\n2:08:14.740 --> 2:08:17.220\n So physical sexuality, physical attraction\n\n2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:18.060\n is the most obvious one.\n\n2:08:18.060 --> 2:08:20.560\n It's the one that everybody talks about and thinks about.\n\n2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:23.180\n But then there's also sapiosexuality,\n\n2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:27.140\n which is being sexually attracted to thoughts,\n\n2:08:27.140 --> 2:08:28.500\n to intelligence.\n\n2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:31.140\n And then you've got all the various varieties\n\n2:08:31.140 --> 2:08:34.060\n of personal preferences.\n\n2:08:34.060 --> 2:08:36.660\n Some people like people of a certain color skin,\n\n2:08:36.660 --> 2:08:39.100\n or they like big noses, they like small noses,\n\n2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:40.740\n they like big butts, they like small butts,\n\n2:08:40.740 --> 2:08:42.220\n they like tall guys, they like bald guys,\n\n2:08:42.220 --> 2:08:43.900\n whatever it might be.\n\n2:08:43.900 --> 2:08:47.220\n You can't ever predict what someone's preferences,\n\n2:08:47.220 --> 2:08:50.940\n sexual arousal preferences are going to be.\n\n2:08:50.940 --> 2:08:53.500\n So then you end up walking into a situation\n\n2:08:53.500 --> 2:08:56.540\n where then you discover, and just imagine,\n\n2:08:56.540 --> 2:09:01.140\n imagine being an unattractive, overweight, married guy,\n\n2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:04.780\n and you're walking into an asset or a target meeting\n\n2:09:04.780 --> 2:09:06.540\n with like a middle aged female\n\n2:09:06.540 --> 2:09:09.020\n who is also not very attractive and also married.\n\n2:09:09.020 --> 2:09:11.700\n But then it turns out that that person is a sapiosexual\n\n2:09:11.700 --> 2:09:14.580\n and gets extremely turned on by intelligent conversation.\n\n2:09:14.580 --> 2:09:16.860\n That's exactly what you're there to do.\n\n2:09:16.860 --> 2:09:20.100\n Your mission is to have intelligent conversation\n\n2:09:20.100 --> 2:09:22.300\n with this person to find out if they have access to secrets.\n\n2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:24.600\n And by virtue of you carrying out your mission,\n\n2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:26.740\n they become extremely aroused and attracted to you.\n\n2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:29.380\n That is a very complicated situation.\n\n2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:30.740\n It's hard to know who to trust.\n\n2:09:30.740 --> 2:09:32.700\n Like, how do you know your wife,\n\n2:09:32.700 --> 2:09:33.620\n or how does your wife know\n\n2:09:33.620 --> 2:09:36.120\n that you're not a double agent from Russia?\n\n2:09:37.420 --> 2:09:42.040\n There's a large element of experience and time\n\n2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:43.140\n that goes into that.\n\n2:09:43.140 --> 2:09:44.340\n She's also trained.\n\n2:09:45.260 --> 2:09:47.100\n And I think my wife and I also.\n\n2:09:47.100 --> 2:09:48.420\n Actually you think.\n\n2:09:48.420 --> 2:09:50.380\n My wife and I also have the benefit\n\n2:09:50.380 --> 2:09:55.380\n of being recruited young and together where.\n\n2:09:56.660 --> 2:09:58.740\n So over time you can start to figure out things\n\n2:09:58.740 --> 2:10:00.500\n that are very difficult to.\n\n2:10:02.060 --> 2:10:03.400\n So you form the baseline,\n\n2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:04.780\n you start to understand the person's very,\n\n2:10:04.780 --> 2:10:06.100\n it becomes very difficult to lie.\n\n2:10:06.100 --> 2:10:08.340\n The most difficult thing in the world is consistency.\n\n2:10:08.340 --> 2:10:10.460\n It's the most difficult thing in the world.\n\n2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:12.900\n Some people say that discipline or self discipline,\n\n2:10:12.900 --> 2:10:14.780\n what they're really talking about is consistency.\n\n2:10:14.780 --> 2:10:17.240\n When you have someone who performs consistently\n\n2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:20.500\n over long periods of time, under various levels of stress,\n\n2:10:20.500 --> 2:10:21.940\n you have high, high confidence\n\n2:10:21.940 --> 2:10:23.620\n that that is the person that you can trust.\n\n2:10:23.620 --> 2:10:25.700\n You can trust, again,\n\n2:10:25.700 --> 2:10:30.220\n you can trust them to behave within a certain pattern.\n\n2:10:30.220 --> 2:10:33.160\n You can trust an asshole to be an asshole\n\n2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:34.780\n without trusting the asshole\n\n2:10:34.780 --> 2:10:36.700\n to take care of your kids, right?\n\n2:10:36.700 --> 2:10:40.020\n So I don't ever wanna mix up the idea of personal trust\n\n2:10:40.020 --> 2:10:42.380\n versus trusting the outcome.\n\n2:10:42.380 --> 2:10:44.020\n You can always trust a person\n\n2:10:44.020 --> 2:10:45.700\n to operate within their pattern of behavior.\n\n2:10:45.700 --> 2:10:49.340\n It just takes time for you to get a consistent,\n\n2:10:49.340 --> 2:10:50.500\n to get consistent feedback\n\n2:10:50.500 --> 2:10:52.220\n as to what that baseline is for them.\n\n2:10:52.220 --> 2:10:55.260\n To form a good model, predictive model\n\n2:10:55.260 --> 2:10:57.060\n of what their behavior is going to be like.\n\n2:10:57.060 --> 2:10:59.420\n Right, and you know, it's fascinating is I think\n\n2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:02.400\n the challenge is building that model quickly.\n\n2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:05.820\n So technology is one of those tools\n\n2:11:05.820 --> 2:11:07.020\n that will be able in the future\n\n2:11:07.020 --> 2:11:10.140\n to very quickly create a model of behavior\n\n2:11:10.140 --> 2:11:13.620\n because technology can pull in multiple data points\n\n2:11:13.620 --> 2:11:15.260\n in a very short period of time\n\n2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:17.820\n that the human brain simply can't pull in\n\n2:11:17.820 --> 2:11:20.500\n at the same space, at the same speed.\n\n2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:22.300\n That's actually what I did my PhD on.\n\n2:11:22.300 --> 2:11:23.460\n That's what I did at Google\n\n2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:25.980\n is forming a good representation,\n\n2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:29.300\n unique representation in the entire world\n\n2:11:29.300 --> 2:11:31.220\n based on the behavior of the person.\n\n2:11:31.220 --> 2:11:33.020\n The specific task there is\n\n2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:35.780\n so that you don't have to type in the password.\n\n2:11:35.780 --> 2:11:38.100\n The idea was to replace the password.\n\n2:11:38.100 --> 2:11:40.700\n But it also allows you to actually study human behavior\n\n2:11:40.700 --> 2:11:41.700\n and to think, all right,\n\n2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:44.360\n what is the unique representation of a person?\n\n2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:48.780\n How, because we have very specific patterns\n\n2:11:48.780 --> 2:11:51.280\n and a lot of humans are very similar in those patterns,\n\n2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:52.940\n what are the unique identifiers\n\n2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:55.140\n within those patterns of behavior?\n\n2:11:55.140 --> 2:11:57.540\n And I think that's, from a psychology perspective,\n\n2:11:57.540 --> 2:11:59.060\n a super fascinating question.\n\n2:11:59.060 --> 2:12:00.940\n And from a machine learning perspective,\n\n2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:02.260\n it's something that you can,\n\n2:12:02.260 --> 2:12:04.460\n as the systems get better and better and better,\n\n2:12:04.460 --> 2:12:07.140\n and as we get more and more digital data\n\n2:12:07.140 --> 2:12:09.580\n about each individual, you start to get,\n\n2:12:09.580 --> 2:12:11.740\n you start to be able to do that kind of thing effectively.\n\n2:12:11.740 --> 2:12:13.160\n And it's, I mean, when I think of the fact\n\n2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:14.960\n that you could create a dossier on somebody\n\n2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:16.900\n in a matter of 24 or 48 hours,\n\n2:12:16.900 --> 2:12:21.100\n if you could wire them for two days, right?\n\n2:12:21.100 --> 2:12:22.300\n Internet of Things style,\n\n2:12:22.300 --> 2:12:23.740\n you put it in their underwear or whatever, right?\n\n2:12:23.740 --> 2:12:26.380\n Some chip that just reads everything.\n\n2:12:26.380 --> 2:12:27.540\n How heavy are they walking?\n\n2:12:27.540 --> 2:12:28.900\n How much time do they sleep?\n\n2:12:28.900 --> 2:12:30.540\n How many times do they open the refrigerator?\n\n2:12:30.540 --> 2:12:32.500\n When they log into their computer, how do they do it?\n\n2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:34.940\n Like, which hand do they use when they log in?\n\n2:12:34.940 --> 2:12:36.860\n What's their most common swipe?\n\n2:12:36.860 --> 2:12:38.380\n What's their most visited website?\n\n2:12:38.380 --> 2:12:42.680\n You could collect an enormous amount of normative data\n\n2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:45.940\n in a short period of time where otherwise we're stuck.\n\n2:12:45.940 --> 2:12:48.860\n The way that we do it now, once or twice a week,\n\n2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:51.100\n we go out for a coffee for two hours.\n\n2:12:51.100 --> 2:12:53.420\n And two hours at a time over the course of six,\n\n2:12:53.420 --> 2:12:57.500\n eight weeks, 12 weeks, you're coming up with a 50%\n\n2:12:57.500 --> 2:13:00.820\n assessment on how you think this person is going to behave.\n\n2:13:00.820 --> 2:13:02.740\n Just that time savings is immense.\n\n2:13:03.660 --> 2:13:06.300\n Something you've also spoken about is private intelligence\n\n2:13:06.300 --> 2:13:10.580\n and the power and the reach and the scale\n\n2:13:10.580 --> 2:13:12.300\n and the importance of private intelligence\n\n2:13:12.300 --> 2:13:13.480\n versus government intelligence.\n\n2:13:13.480 --> 2:13:16.980\n Can you elaborate on the role of what is private intelligence\n\n2:13:16.980 --> 2:13:19.500\n and what's the role of private intelligence\n\n2:13:19.500 --> 2:13:22.300\n in the scope of all the intelligence\n\n2:13:22.300 --> 2:13:26.340\n that is gathered and used in the United States?\n\n2:13:26.340 --> 2:13:27.180\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:30.620\n It's something that so few people know about.\n\n2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:33.920\n And it became a more mainstream topic\n\n2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:35.780\n with the Trump administration.\n\n2:13:35.780 --> 2:13:39.020\n Because Trump made it no secret that he was going to hire\n\n2:13:39.020 --> 2:13:40.320\n private intelligence organizations\n\n2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:42.140\n to run his intelligence operations.\n\n2:13:42.140 --> 2:13:43.140\n And fund them.\n\n2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:44.940\n So that really brought it to the mainstream.\n\n2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:46.860\n But going all the way back to 9 11,\n\n2:13:46.860 --> 2:13:48.900\n going all the way back to 2001,\n\n2:13:48.900 --> 2:13:51.980\n when the 9 11 attacks happened,\n\n2:13:51.980 --> 2:13:56.140\n there was a commission that was formed\n\n2:13:56.140 --> 2:14:00.700\n to determine the reasons that 9 11 happened.\n\n2:14:00.700 --> 2:14:02.460\n And among the lists that they determined,\n\n2:14:02.460 --> 2:14:04.180\n of course they found out that the intelligence community\n\n2:14:04.180 --> 2:14:06.320\n wasn't coordinating well with each other.\n\n2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:08.320\n There were fiefdoms and there was infighting\n\n2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:10.340\n and there wasn't good intel sharing.\n\n2:14:10.340 --> 2:14:11.920\n But more than that, they identified\n\n2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:16.140\n that we were operating at Cold War levels,\n\n2:14:16.140 --> 2:14:18.260\n even though we were living in a time\n\n2:14:18.260 --> 2:14:20.460\n when terrorism was the new biggest threat\n\n2:14:20.460 --> 2:14:22.020\n to national security.\n\n2:14:22.020 --> 2:14:25.540\n So the big recommendation coming out of the 9 11 commission\n\n2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:27.420\n was that the intelligence organizations,\n\n2:14:27.420 --> 2:14:30.100\n the intelligence community significantly increased\n\n2:14:30.100 --> 2:14:33.060\n the presence of intelligence operators overseas\n\n2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:36.140\n and in terms of analytical capacity\n\n2:14:36.140 --> 2:14:38.180\n here in the United States.\n\n2:14:38.180 --> 2:14:40.440\n When they made that decision,\n\n2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:44.760\n it completely destroyed, it totally was incongruent\n\n2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:46.360\n with the existing hiring process\n\n2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:48.740\n because the existing hiring process for CIA or NSA\n\n2:14:48.740 --> 2:14:51.060\n is a six to nine month process.\n\n2:14:51.060 --> 2:14:55.180\n The only way they could plus up their sizes fast enough\n\n2:14:55.180 --> 2:14:57.820\n was to bypass their own hiring\n\n2:14:57.820 --> 2:15:00.760\n and instead go direct to private organizations.\n\n2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:04.940\n So naturally the government contracted with the companies\n\n2:15:04.940 --> 2:15:07.680\n that they already had secure contracts with,\n\n2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:12.680\n Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Khaki, you name it.\n\n2:15:12.820 --> 2:15:15.380\n And then over time from 2001 to now,\n\n2:15:15.380 --> 2:15:17.520\n or I guess that started really in 2004\n\n2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:19.820\n when they started significantly increasing\n\n2:15:19.820 --> 2:15:22.020\n the presence of private intelligence officers.\n\n2:15:22.900 --> 2:15:26.540\n From then until now, it's become a budgetary thing.\n\n2:15:26.540 --> 2:15:30.240\n It's become a continuity of operations thing.\n\n2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:33.820\n And now the reason Northern Virginia\n\n2:15:33.820 --> 2:15:37.620\n has become one of the wealthiest zip codes in America\n\n2:15:37.620 --> 2:15:40.180\n is because of the incredible concentration\n\n2:15:40.180 --> 2:15:43.400\n of private intelligence that is supporting CIA, NSA,\n\n2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:46.900\n DIA, FBI, and all the slew of IC partners.\n\n2:15:46.900 --> 2:15:49.260\n By the way, does Palantir play a role in this?\n\n2:15:49.260 --> 2:15:51.160\n Palantir is one of those organizations\n\n2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:54.100\n that was trying to pitch their product\n\n2:15:54.100 --> 2:15:57.420\n to an intelligence community because they have,\n\n2:15:57.420 --> 2:15:59.920\n it's a fantastic product on paper.\n\n2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:05.260\n But the challenge was the proprietary services,\n\n2:16:05.260 --> 2:16:08.100\n the proprietary systems that we current that we used\n\n2:16:08.100 --> 2:16:13.100\n in CIA prior to Palantir continued to outperform Palantir.\n\n2:16:13.460 --> 2:16:16.380\n So just like any other business decision,\n\n2:16:16.380 --> 2:16:18.660\n if you've got homegrown systems\n\n2:16:18.660 --> 2:16:20.220\n that outperform external systems,\n\n2:16:20.220 --> 2:16:23.380\n then it's not worth it to share the internal information.\n\n2:16:23.380 --> 2:16:24.260\n Got it.\n\n2:16:24.260 --> 2:16:29.260\n So what the close connection between Peter Thiel\n\n2:16:29.660 --> 2:16:33.100\n and Donald Trump, did that have a role to play\n\n2:16:33.100 --> 2:16:38.100\n in Donald Trump's leveraging of private intelligence\n\n2:16:38.860 --> 2:16:40.620\n or is that completely disjoint?\n\n2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:45.520\n I think that they're related but only circumstantially.\n\n2:16:45.520 --> 2:16:46.700\n Because remember, Donald Trump\n\n2:16:46.700 --> 2:16:48.980\n wasn't really investing in CIA.\n\n2:16:48.980 --> 2:16:51.080\n So the last thing he wanted to do\n\n2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:54.420\n was spend his network, WASTA,\n\n2:16:54.420 --> 2:16:56.220\n WASTA is a term that we call influence,\n\n2:16:56.220 --> 2:16:58.080\n it's an Arabic term for influence.\n\n2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:02.060\n Trump didn't wanna use his WASTA putting Thiel into CIA\n\n2:17:02.060 --> 2:17:03.740\n only to lose Thiel's contract\n\n2:17:03.740 --> 2:17:04.900\n as soon as Trump left office.\n\n2:17:04.900 --> 2:17:08.040\n So instead, it was more valuable to put Peter Thiel's tool\n\n2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:09.420\n to use in private intelligence.\n\n2:17:09.420 --> 2:17:11.360\n And then of course, I think he nominated Peter Thiel\n\n2:17:11.360 --> 2:17:15.420\n to be his Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State.\n\n2:17:15.420 --> 2:17:17.180\n At some point in time, he tried to present,\n\n2:17:17.180 --> 2:17:19.100\n like presidentially appoint Peter Thiel\n\n2:17:19.100 --> 2:17:23.140\n into a position of government authority.\n\n2:17:23.140 --> 2:17:27.740\n What do you think of figures like Peter Thiel?\n\n2:17:27.740 --> 2:17:30.860\n Do they wield, and I'm sure there's figures\n\n2:17:30.860 --> 2:17:35.260\n of similar scale and reach and power\n\n2:17:35.260 --> 2:17:37.140\n in private intelligence.\n\n2:17:37.140 --> 2:17:40.660\n What do you think about their role and power\n\n2:17:40.660 --> 2:17:44.460\n in this whole, like without public accountability\n\n2:17:44.460 --> 2:17:47.220\n that you would think directors of CIA perhaps have?\n\n2:17:47.220 --> 2:17:49.920\n So this is where private intelligence\n\n2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:51.980\n has both a strength and a weakness.\n\n2:17:53.100 --> 2:17:56.180\n The ultimate law overriding,\n\n2:17:56.180 --> 2:17:58.140\n that's overseeing private intelligence\n\n2:17:58.140 --> 2:18:03.140\n is not government legislation.\n\n2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:05.560\n It's the law of economics.\n\n2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:07.520\n If they produce a superior product,\n\n2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:09.320\n then they will have a buyer.\n\n2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:11.300\n If they do not produce a superior product,\n\n2:18:11.300 --> 2:18:13.460\n they will not have a buyer.\n\n2:18:13.460 --> 2:18:16.300\n And that's a very simple business principle.\n\n2:18:16.300 --> 2:18:20.800\n Whereas in the current national security infrastructure,\n\n2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:22.900\n you can create a crap product,\n\n2:18:22.900 --> 2:18:25.700\n but the taxpayer dollars are always going to be spent.\n\n2:18:25.700 --> 2:18:28.100\n So it's really thrown things for a loop.\n\n2:18:28.100 --> 2:18:29.760\n Especially during the Trump administration.\n\n2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:32.240\n And this is one of the things that I will always say\n\n2:18:32.240 --> 2:18:34.660\n I liked about the Trump administration.\n\n2:18:34.660 --> 2:18:38.700\n It shown, it put a big blazing bright light\n\n2:18:38.700 --> 2:18:41.720\n on all of the flaws within our system.\n\n2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:45.680\n One of those flaws being this executive power\n\n2:18:45.680 --> 2:18:47.400\n over the intelligence organizations\n\n2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:50.460\n and the lack of accountability\n\n2:18:50.460 --> 2:18:53.460\n for intelligence organizations to produce a superior product.\n\n2:18:53.460 --> 2:18:58.460\n When that light got shown down,\n\n2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:01.640\n that's when you also saw Trump start to go after,\n\n2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:02.960\n if you remember, there was a period\n\n2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.680\n where he was taking security clearances away\n\n2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:06.480\n from retiring officers.\n\n2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:08.760\n That became a big hot issue.\n\n2:19:08.760 --> 2:19:11.600\n That became something that people were very opposed to\n\n2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:14.880\n when they didn't realize that that process\n\n2:19:14.880 --> 2:19:17.160\n of taking security clearances away,\n\n2:19:17.160 --> 2:19:19.960\n that incentivized seasoned senior officers\n\n2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:21.800\n to stay in service.\n\n2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:23.260\n Because with private intelligence\n\n2:19:23.260 --> 2:19:25.320\n paying a premium during the Trump administration,\n\n2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:26.980\n because Trump was paying a premium\n\n2:19:26.980 --> 2:19:29.220\n to the private intelligence world,\n\n2:19:29.220 --> 2:19:33.060\n when senior officers found that it was more profitable\n\n2:19:33.060 --> 2:19:35.600\n to retire early, keep their clearance,\n\n2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:38.440\n and go work for Raytheon, Trump saw that\n\n2:19:38.440 --> 2:19:41.500\n as bypassing service to the American people.\n\n2:19:41.500 --> 2:19:44.040\n You've made a career in CIA, you've made a career in NSA,\n\n2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:44.960\n you should stay there.\n\n2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:46.760\n If you leave, you lose your clearance\n\n2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:49.280\n because you no longer have a need to know.\n\n2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:51.920\n He upset the apple cart with that.\n\n2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:54.200\n And unfortunately, the narrative that came out\n\n2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:56.400\n in many ways was a negative narrative against Trump,\n\n2:19:56.400 --> 2:20:00.120\n when in fact, he was actually doing quite a service\n\n2:20:00.120 --> 2:20:03.520\n to the American people, trying to take away\n\n2:20:03.520 --> 2:20:07.800\n the incentive of senior officials leaving their service\n\n2:20:07.800 --> 2:20:10.280\n in order to just profiteer in the private intelligence.\n\n2:20:10.280 --> 2:20:15.280\n So in that way, he was kind of supporting the CIA\n\n2:20:15.500 --> 2:20:19.860\n in making sure that competent people\n\n2:20:19.860 --> 2:20:22.720\n and experienced people stay in CIA,\n\n2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:24.000\n are incentivized to stay there.\n\n2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:27.520\n Correct, I think that there was definitely,\n\n2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:29.040\n he understood incentives.\n\n2:20:29.040 --> 2:20:31.240\n I mean, Donald Trump understands incentives.\n\n2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:34.200\n So he was trying to incentivize them to stay,\n\n2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:36.840\n but I think he was also playing a safety card\n\n2:20:36.840 --> 2:20:40.200\n because he didn't want former CIA officials\n\n2:20:40.200 --> 2:20:42.160\n who were not listening to him\n\n2:20:42.160 --> 2:20:44.180\n to then move into private intel organizations\n\n2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:47.800\n that he may be hiring, only to then have them undermine him\n\n2:20:47.800 --> 2:20:49.480\n from both sides of the coin.\n\n2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:53.200\n So there was a little bit of offensive calculation\n\n2:20:53.200 --> 2:20:54.040\n in there as well.\n\n2:20:54.040 --> 2:20:56.720\n But do the dynamics and the incentives of economics\n\n2:20:56.720 --> 2:20:58.820\n that you referred to that the private intelligence\n\n2:20:58.820 --> 2:21:01.920\n operates under, is that more or less ethical\n\n2:21:01.920 --> 2:21:06.920\n than the forces that maybe government agencies operate under?\n\n2:21:07.560 --> 2:21:08.560\n What's your intuition?\n\n2:21:08.560 --> 2:21:12.760\n Is capitalism lead, so you mentioned it leads\n\n2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:16.900\n to maximizations of efficiency and performance,\n\n2:21:16.900 --> 2:21:19.920\n but is that correlated with ethical behavior\n\n2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:24.080\n when we're talking about such hairy activities\n\n2:21:24.080 --> 2:21:26.180\n like collection of intelligence?\n\n2:21:26.180 --> 2:21:27.920\n The question of ethics is a great question.\n\n2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:31.640\n So let me start this whole thing out by saying,\n\n2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:36.640\n CIA hires people on a spectrum\n\n2:21:36.640 --> 2:21:41.640\n of our ability to be morally flexible, ethically flexible.\n\n2:21:41.880 --> 2:21:45.340\n All people at their heart are ethically flexible.\n\n2:21:45.340 --> 2:21:48.080\n I would never punch somebody in the face, right?\n\n2:21:48.080 --> 2:21:49.040\n Some people out there would say,\n\n2:21:49.040 --> 2:21:51.160\n I would never hurt another human being.\n\n2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:53.720\n But as soon as a human being posed a direct threat\n\n2:21:53.720 --> 2:21:56.840\n to their daughter or their son or their mother,\n\n2:21:56.840 --> 2:21:58.100\n now all of a sudden they're gonna change\n\n2:21:58.100 --> 2:22:01.520\n their ethical stance in self defense, right?\n\n2:22:01.520 --> 2:22:02.340\n But at the end of the day,\n\n2:22:02.340 --> 2:22:05.280\n it's still hurting another person.\n\n2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:07.520\n So what CIA looks for is people who are able\n\n2:22:07.520 --> 2:22:12.520\n to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses, right?\n\n2:22:12.520 --> 2:22:13.600\n More flexibility.\n\n2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:18.880\n I do not believe that private intelligence\n\n2:22:18.880 --> 2:22:21.520\n and the laws of economics lend themselves\n\n2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:25.640\n to increased ethics or increased ethical behavior\n\n2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:26.960\n in the short term.\n\n2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:31.280\n But what ends up happening is that in the long term,\n\n2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:34.560\n in order to scale economic benefits,\n\n2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:39.560\n you are forced to act within norms of your customer base.\n\n2:22:39.560 --> 2:22:42.040\n So as the norms of that customer base\n\n2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:44.240\n dictate certain requirements,\n\n2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:46.680\n the company has to adapt to those requirements\n\n2:22:46.680 --> 2:22:49.040\n in order to continue to scale.\n\n2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:54.040\n So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ\n\n2:22:54.680 --> 2:22:58.680\n or if they try to ostracize men or ostracize women,\n\n2:22:58.680 --> 2:23:01.640\n they're limiting their ability to grow economically.\n\n2:23:01.640 --> 2:23:05.720\n They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing\n\n2:23:05.720 --> 2:23:09.480\n ethical requirement of their customer base.\n\n2:23:09.480 --> 2:23:10.320\n That's such an interesting question\n\n2:23:10.320 --> 2:23:13.520\n because you look at big pharma and pharmaceutical companies,\n\n2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:19.400\n and they have quite a poor reputation in the public eye.\n\n2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:23.920\n And some of it, maybe much of it is deserved,\n\n2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:26.160\n at least historically speaking.\n\n2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:28.560\n And so you start to wonder, well,\n\n2:23:28.560 --> 2:23:33.560\n can intelligence agencies use some of the same methods\n\n2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:36.520\n or can these use some of the same technique\n\n2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:38.880\n to manipulate the public,\n\n2:23:40.160 --> 2:23:42.920\n like what they believe about those agencies\n\n2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:45.040\n in order to maximize profit as well?\n\n2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:49.920\n Sort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths\n\n2:23:49.920 --> 2:23:52.720\n that allow you to not be ultimately\n\n2:23:53.600 --> 2:23:55.040\n responsible to the customer.\n\n2:23:55.040 --> 2:23:56.040\n Absolutely.\n\n2:23:56.040 --> 2:23:58.800\n And I would go a step further to say that\n\n2:23:58.800 --> 2:24:01.880\n the covert nature of intelligence operations\n\n2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:06.400\n is really attractive when it comes to the private sector,\n\n2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:08.960\n because now they have all the same money\n\n2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:10.880\n with none of the oversight,\n\n2:24:10.880 --> 2:24:13.240\n and all they have to do is deliver.\n\n2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:17.440\n So without the oversight, what's holding you back?\n\n2:24:17.440 --> 2:24:20.520\n And for anybody who's ever run a business,\n\n2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:21.760\n anybody who's ever started a startup\n\n2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:23.080\n or tried to make something succeed,\n\n2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:25.360\n we all know that there come those times\n\n2:24:25.360 --> 2:24:28.840\n where you have to skirt the boundaries\n\n2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:33.840\n of propriety or morality or commitments\n\n2:24:34.280 --> 2:24:35.720\n or promises to other people,\n\n2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:37.640\n because at the end of the day,\n\n2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:39.960\n if your business fails, it's on you.\n\n2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:43.880\n So if you promise to deliver something to a client,\n\n2:24:43.880 --> 2:24:44.960\n you've got to deliver it to the client,\n\n2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:47.320\n even if that means you stay up late\n\n2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:49.920\n or if you lie on your taxes, whatever it might be,\n\n2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:52.280\n there's a certain level of do or die.\n\n2:24:52.280 --> 2:24:55.360\n Yeah, I personally have a sort of optimistic view\n\n2:24:55.360 --> 2:25:00.200\n that ultimately the best way is to stay\n\n2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:02.720\n within the ethical bounds, kind of like what you suggested.\n\n2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:05.800\n If you want to be a company that's extremely successful,\n\n2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:09.800\n is win with competence, not with cheating,\n\n2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:14.100\n because cheating won't, I believe, win in the long term.\n\n2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:20.160\n But in terms of being publicly responsible\n\n2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:24.840\n to your decisions, I mean, I've already been supposed\n\n2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:27.160\n to talk to Peter Thiel twice on this podcast,\n\n2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:28.660\n and it's just been complicated.\n\n2:25:28.660 --> 2:25:32.140\n If I were to put myself into his shoes,\n\n2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:35.400\n why do podcasts?\n\n2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:40.000\n The risk is too high to be a public person at all.\n\n2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.240\n And so I totally understand that.\n\n2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:47.120\n At the same time, I think if you're doing things\n\n2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:55.120\n by the book and you're the best in the world at your job,\n\n2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:56.680\n then you have nothing to worry about.\n\n2:25:56.680 --> 2:25:59.120\n And you can advertise that and you recruit,\n\n2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:02.800\n you help recruit, I mean, that's the work of capitalism\n\n2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:07.160\n is you want to advertise that this is the place\n\n2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:10.440\n where the best people in the world at this thing work.\n\n2:26:10.440 --> 2:26:14.160\n True, I think that your point of view is accurate.\n\n2:26:14.160 --> 2:26:19.160\n I would also say that the complexities\n\n2:26:19.160 --> 2:26:21.080\n of what makes somebody make a decision\n\n2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:26.160\n can only really be properly calculated with a baseline.\n\n2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:27.600\n So because there is no baseline\n\n2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:29.400\n that you or I have on Peter Thiel,\n\n2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:33.040\n it's difficult to really ascertain why he does\n\n2:26:33.040 --> 2:26:35.400\n or doesn't accept invites or why he does or doesn't appear.\n\n2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:40.400\n Well, let me ask your opinion on the NSA,\n\n2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:42.600\n and then maybe you could mention\n\n2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:46.440\n about bulk collection in general in the CIA,\n\n2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:51.160\n but let's look at some history with the NSA and Snowden.\n\n2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:55.880\n What's your opinion on the mass surveillance\n\n2:26:55.880 --> 2:27:00.880\n that is reported to have been conducted by the NSA?\n\n2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:04.720\n We've talked about ethics.\n\n2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:09.720\n Are you troubled by the, from a public perception,\n\n2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:14.720\n the unethical nature of mass surveillance\n\n2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:17.920\n of especially American citizens?\n\n2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:21.920\n This is a topic that I never get tired of talking about,\n\n2:27:21.920 --> 2:27:25.320\n but it's very rare that anyone ever really agrees with me,\n\n2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:26.160\n just so you know.\n\n2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:30.680\n I see where you're, well, I think there's a nuance thing\n\n2:27:30.680 --> 2:27:32.440\n here and maybe we'll find some agreement.\n\n2:27:32.440 --> 2:27:37.440\n The truth is that the American experience after 9 11\n\n2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:40.600\n is nothing like the American experience now.\n\n2:27:40.600 --> 2:27:45.040\n So all the terminology, all the talk about privacy\n\n2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:47.080\n and privacy laws and mass surveillance\n\n2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:48.200\n and all this other stuff,\n\n2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:50.480\n it was a completely different time then.\n\n2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:52.000\n And that's not to say it was an excuse,\n\n2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:57.000\n because to this day, I will still say mass collection,\n\n2:27:57.080 --> 2:28:00.160\n bulk collection of data that allows\n\n2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:02.800\n for an expedient identification of a threat\n\n2:28:02.800 --> 2:28:06.560\n to national security benefits all of us,\n\n2:28:06.560 --> 2:28:09.520\n but people don't understand what they want.\n\n2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:11.080\n Like people don't understand what the value\n\n2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:13.200\n of their own privacy is.\n\n2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:14.280\n First of all, the fact that people think\n\n2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:17.520\n they have personal privacy is laughable.\n\n2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:19.080\n You have no privacy.\n\n2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:20.560\n The cell phone that you carry in your pocket,\n\n2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:22.520\n you're giving permission to those apps constantly.\n\n2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:24.240\n You're giving commercial organizations,\n\n2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:25.560\n what you and I have already said,\n\n2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:28.680\n are less tied to ethical responsibility.\n\n2:28:28.680 --> 2:28:31.760\n You're giving them permission to collect enormous amounts\n\n2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:34.160\n of private data from you all the time.\n\n2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:37.480\n And do you know what happens if AT&T or Verizon\n\n2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:40.800\n sees some nefarious activity on your account?\n\n2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:42.080\n They do nothing.\n\n2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:45.520\n They might send a note to FBI because they have to,\n\n2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:47.160\n according to some checklist.\n\n2:28:47.160 --> 2:28:49.600\n But when NSA was collecting intelligence\n\n2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:51.800\n on metadata from around the United States,\n\n2:28:51.800 --> 2:28:54.960\n they were very specifically looking for terrorist threats\n\n2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:56.600\n that would harm American lives.\n\n2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:00.440\n Man, NSA can clone my phone.\n\n2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:01.960\n I will give them my children's phone.\n\n2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:04.800\n I will give them the passwords to every one of my accounts\n\n2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:07.080\n if it means that there's a likelihood\n\n2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:09.920\n that my family will be safer from a nefarious actor\n\n2:29:09.920 --> 2:29:12.240\n who's intent on hurting us.\n\n2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:15.000\n NSA doesn't care about your affair.\n\n2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:17.120\n NSA doesn't care if you're cheating on your taxes.\n\n2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:20.800\n NSA doesn't care if you talk shit about your boss\n\n2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:22.720\n or if you hate the US president.\n\n2:29:22.720 --> 2:29:24.560\n Nobody cares about that.\n\n2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:26.000\n Your intelligence community is there\n\n2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:29.440\n to find threats to national security.\n\n2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:31.800\n That's what they're there to do.\n\n2:29:31.800 --> 2:29:35.640\n What Snowden did when he outed that whole program,\n\n2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:38.920\n the fact that the court, the justice system,\n\n2:29:38.920 --> 2:29:41.360\n the civilian justice system went back\n\n2:29:41.360 --> 2:29:44.280\n and essentially overruled the ruling\n\n2:29:44.280 --> 2:29:47.000\n of the intelligence courts before them\n\n2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:51.680\n just goes to show how the general mass community\n\n2:29:51.680 --> 2:29:53.520\n really shouldn't have a say\n\n2:29:53.520 --> 2:29:55.680\n in what happens in the intelligence community.\n\n2:29:55.680 --> 2:29:56.840\n They really shouldn't.\n\n2:29:56.840 --> 2:30:00.760\n You have politicians and you have the opportunity\n\n2:30:00.760 --> 2:30:03.760\n to elect people to a position and then you trust them.\n\n2:30:03.760 --> 2:30:05.840\n That's what a representative republic is.\n\n2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:07.280\n You vote the people in,\n\n2:30:07.280 --> 2:30:09.040\n you trust them to work on your behalf.\n\n2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:11.680\n They make decisions without running them by you.\n\n2:30:11.680 --> 2:30:14.520\n They make decisions that they believe\n\n2:30:14.520 --> 2:30:16.240\n are in the best interest of their constituency\n\n2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:19.760\n and that's how our form of democracy works.\n\n2:30:21.240 --> 2:30:23.520\n It worked, we were safer.\n\n2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:25.360\n Now that we don't have that information\n\n2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:27.240\n and now that there's this giant looming question\n\n2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:28.880\n of whether or not NSA is there to serve people\n\n2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:31.200\n or is collecting mass surveillance\n\n2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:33.400\n against all American people,\n\n2:30:33.400 --> 2:30:35.600\n that's not really a true accurate representation\n\n2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:36.880\n of what they were ever doing.\n\n2:30:36.880 --> 2:30:39.280\n They were looking for the needle in a haystack\n\n2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:42.680\n of the series of transactions in metadata\n\n2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:45.560\n that was going to lead to American deaths.\n\n2:30:45.560 --> 2:30:48.880\n We are now less secure because they can't do that\n\n2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:50.760\n and that bothers me.\n\n2:30:50.760 --> 2:30:53.800\n So you said a few really interesting things there.\n\n2:30:53.800 --> 2:30:56.600\n So because you are kind of an insider,\n\n2:30:56.600 --> 2:30:59.480\n or were for a time an insider, meaning you were able\n\n2:30:59.480 --> 2:31:03.040\n to build up an intuition about the good, the bad,\n\n2:31:03.040 --> 2:31:07.240\n and the ugly of these institutions, specifically the good.\n\n2:31:07.240 --> 2:31:09.560\n A lot of people don't have a good sense of the good.\n\n2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:11.400\n They know the bad and the ugly\n\n2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:14.000\n or can infer the bad and the ugly.\n\n2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:18.240\n You mentioned that the one little key little thing there\n\n2:31:18.240 --> 2:31:22.560\n at the end saying the NSA doesn't care\n\n2:31:22.560 --> 2:31:24.880\n about whether you hate the president or not.\n\n2:31:24.880 --> 2:31:28.640\n Now that's what people really worry about\n\n2:31:28.640 --> 2:31:32.400\n is they're not sure they can trust the government\n\n2:31:32.400 --> 2:31:36.280\n to not go into full dictatorial mode\n\n2:31:36.280 --> 2:31:40.020\n and basing your political preference, your oppositions,\n\n2:31:40.020 --> 2:31:43.100\n your, basically one of the essential powers,\n\n2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:48.040\n the freedom of speech in the United States\n\n2:31:48.040 --> 2:31:49.680\n is the ability to criticize your government.\n\n2:31:49.680 --> 2:31:50.520\n Exactly.\n\n2:31:50.520 --> 2:31:55.520\n And that, they worry, well, can't the government\n\n2:31:56.200 --> 2:31:59.720\n get a hold of the NSA and start to ask the basic question,\n\n2:31:59.720 --> 2:32:02.320\n well, can you give me a list of people\n\n2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:03.840\n that are criticizing the government?\n\n2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:06.080\n Think about, so let's just walk through that exact example,\n\n2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:08.760\n right, because this is, it's a preponderance,\n\n2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:12.400\n it's a preponderance fear, it's a ridiculous fear\n\n2:32:12.400 --> 2:32:15.560\n because you would have to tap on multiple elements\n\n2:32:15.560 --> 2:32:16.880\n of government for anything to happen.\n\n2:32:16.880 --> 2:32:20.440\n So for example, let's just say that somebody goes\n\n2:32:20.440 --> 2:32:22.560\n to the NSA and says, hey, can you give us a readout\n\n2:32:22.560 --> 2:32:25.380\n on all the people who are tweeting terrible things\n\n2:32:25.380 --> 2:32:26.400\n about the president?\n\n2:32:26.400 --> 2:32:28.940\n Okay, cool, here's your hundred million people,\n\n2:32:28.940 --> 2:32:30.200\n whatever it is, right?\n\n2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:31.400\n Here's all the people saying negative things\n\n2:32:31.400 --> 2:32:32.680\n about the government.\n\n2:32:32.680 --> 2:32:35.480\n So now they have a list, what do they do next?\n\n2:32:35.480 --> 2:32:37.100\n Well, let's just make it simple.\n\n2:32:37.100 --> 2:32:40.240\n They stay with NSA and they say, surveil them even more,\n\n2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:42.580\n tap their phones, tap their computers,\n\n2:32:42.580 --> 2:32:43.480\n I wanna know even more.\n\n2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:46.280\n So then they get this preponderance of evidence.\n\n2:32:46.280 --> 2:32:47.920\n What do you do with evidence?\n\n2:32:47.920 --> 2:32:49.920\n You take it to a court.\n\n2:32:49.920 --> 2:32:52.760\n Well, guess what no court is going to support?\n\n2:32:52.760 --> 2:32:56.920\n Anything that goes against the freedom of speech.\n\n2:32:56.920 --> 2:32:58.900\n So the court is not going to support\n\n2:32:58.900 --> 2:33:01.120\n what the executive is asking them to do.\n\n2:33:01.120 --> 2:33:03.080\n Even before you take somebody to court,\n\n2:33:03.080 --> 2:33:05.240\n you have to involve law enforcement.\n\n2:33:05.240 --> 2:33:08.100\n Essentially, you have to send some sort of police force\n\n2:33:08.100 --> 2:33:11.520\n to go apprehend the individual who's in question.\n\n2:33:11.520 --> 2:33:13.600\n Well, guess what doesn't meet criteria\n\n2:33:13.600 --> 2:33:16.440\n for any police force anywhere in the United States?\n\n2:33:16.440 --> 2:33:20.780\n Arresting people who say negative things\n\n2:33:20.780 --> 2:33:21.620\n about the president.\n\n2:33:21.620 --> 2:33:25.120\n Now, if somebody poses a threat to the life\n\n2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:27.800\n of a public figure or the threat to life of a politician,\n\n2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:29.320\n that's a completely different case,\n\n2:33:29.320 --> 2:33:31.280\n which means the standards of evidence are much higher\n\n2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:32.720\n for them to arrest that person.\n\n2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:36.160\n So unless you create a secret police force,\n\n2:33:36.160 --> 2:33:37.920\n then your actual public police force\n\n2:33:37.920 --> 2:33:39.240\n is never gonna take action.\n\n2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:42.680\n So all these people who are afraid of this exact situation\n\n2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:43.680\n that you're outlying,\n\n2:33:43.680 --> 2:33:46.660\n they need the creation of a secret police force,\n\n2:33:46.660 --> 2:33:48.080\n the creation of a secret court\n\n2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:50.120\n that operates outside the judicial system,\n\n2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:52.080\n the creation of a secret intelligence service\n\n2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:54.880\n that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection,\n\n2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:57.080\n all so that a handful of people\n\n2:33:57.080 --> 2:34:00.220\n who don't like the president get what?\n\n2:34:00.220 --> 2:34:04.440\n Whisked away, assassinated, put in prison, who knows what?\n\n2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:06.160\n Think about the resources that would be,\n\n2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:08.320\n the amount of money and time\n\n2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:10.840\n and how hard would it be to keep that secret,\n\n2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:13.000\n to have all of those things in motion.\n\n2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:15.840\n The reason it worked in Russia and Soviet Germany\n\n2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:17.480\n or Russia and communist Germany\n\n2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:21.080\n was because everybody knew there was a secret police.\n\n2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:23.740\n Everybody knew that there was a threat\n\n2:34:23.740 --> 2:34:25.480\n to work to speaking out against the government.\n\n2:34:25.480 --> 2:34:26.800\n It's completely different here.\n\n2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:28.680\n Well, so there's a lot to say.\n\n2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:32.120\n So one is yes, if I was a dictator\n\n2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:35.380\n and I wanted to, and just looking at history,\n\n2:34:36.320 --> 2:34:38.380\n let me take myself out of it,\n\n2:34:38.380 --> 2:34:41.000\n but I think one of the more effective ways\n\n2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:43.000\n is you don't need the surveillance.\n\n2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.440\n You can pick out a random person\n\n2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:49.360\n and in a public display, semi public display,\n\n2:34:50.800 --> 2:34:54.400\n basically put them in jail for opposing the government,\n\n2:34:54.400 --> 2:34:56.040\n whether they oppose it or not,\n\n2:34:56.040 --> 2:34:59.440\n and the fear, that sends a message to a lot of people.\n\n2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:02.080\n That's exactly what you see happening in China.\n\n2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:03.480\n That's what you just light out.\n\n2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:06.160\n It's genius, and that is the standard.\n\n2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:07.720\n You don't need the surveillance for that.\n\n2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:09.040\n Yep.\n\n2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:12.600\n But that said, if you did do the surveillance,\n\n2:35:13.460 --> 2:35:15.400\n so that's the support, the sort of,\n\n2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:17.220\n the incentives aren't aligned.\n\n2:35:17.220 --> 2:35:18.600\n It seems like a lot of work to do\n\n2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:20.600\n for the thing you could do without the surveillance.\n\n2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:21.440\n Right.\n\n2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:25.680\n But yes, the courts wouldn't,\n\n2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:29.400\n if you were to be able to get a list of people,\n\n2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:31.400\n which I think that part you could do.\n\n2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:32.980\n Correct.\n\n2:35:32.980 --> 2:35:34.160\n That oppose the government.\n\n2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:36.920\n You could do that just like you said on Twitter publicly.\n\n2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:38.540\n You could make a list.\n\n2:35:38.540 --> 2:35:41.240\n And with that, you can start to,\n\n2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:43.100\n especially if you have a lot of data on those people,\n\n2:35:43.100 --> 2:35:46.400\n find ways in which they did violate the law.\n\n2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:48.840\n Not because they oppose the government,\n\n2:35:48.840 --> 2:35:50.240\n but because in some other way.\n\n2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:53.880\n They'll park your tickets or didn't pay the taxes.\n\n2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:55.160\n That's probably a common one,\n\n2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:57.900\n or like screwed up something about the taxes.\n\n2:35:57.900 --> 2:36:00.600\n I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine,\n\n2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:03.020\n they're very good at this kind of stuff.\n\n2:36:03.020 --> 2:36:06.400\n Knowing how the citizens screwed everything up,\n\n2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:08.720\n because especially in those countries,\n\n2:36:08.720 --> 2:36:10.960\n everybody's breaking the law.\n\n2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:13.100\n Because in a corrupt nation,\n\n2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:16.160\n you have to bend the law to operate the war.\n\n2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:18.840\n The number of people that pay taxes fully\n\n2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:22.560\n in those nations is just very low, not zero.\n\n2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:26.440\n And so they then use that breaking of the law\n\n2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:29.400\n to come up with an excuse to actually put you in jail\n\n2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:31.040\n based on that.\n\n2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:33.080\n So it's possible to imagine.\n\n2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:34.360\n But yes, I think,\n\n2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:39.360\n I think that's the ugly part of surveillance.\n\n2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:41.960\n But I do think, just like you said,\n\n2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:43.560\n the incentives aren't correct.\n\n2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:47.480\n Like you really don't need to get all of the secret police\n\n2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:49.920\n and all of these kinds of organizations working.\n\n2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:53.640\n If you do have a charismatic, powerful leader\n\n2:36:53.640 --> 2:36:55.840\n that built up a network that's able to control\n\n2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:00.360\n a lot of organizations to a level of authoritarianism\n\n2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:03.820\n in a government, they're just able to do the usual thing.\n\n2:37:03.820 --> 2:37:06.800\n One, have propaganda machine to tell narratives.\n\n2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:10.860\n Two, pick out people that they can put in jail\n\n2:37:10.860 --> 2:37:12.340\n for opposing the state.\n\n2:37:12.340 --> 2:37:15.040\n And maybe loud members of the press\n\n2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:16.200\n start silencing the press.\n\n2:37:16.200 --> 2:37:19.040\n There's a playbook to this thing.\n\n2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:21.160\n It doesn't require the surveillance.\n\n2:37:21.160 --> 2:37:24.680\n The surveillance, you know what is useful\n\n2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:27.920\n for the surveillance is the thing you mentioned in China,\n\n2:37:27.920 --> 2:37:32.920\n which is encourage everybody in the citizenry\n\n2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:35.440\n to watch each other,\n\n2:37:35.440 --> 2:37:38.080\n to say there's enemies of the state everywhere.\n\n2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:40.880\n And then you start having children reporting\n\n2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:42.880\n on their appearance and that kind of stuff.\n\n2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:46.040\n Again, don't need a surveillance state for that.\n\n2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:49.420\n Now the good of a surveillance system,\n\n2:37:49.420 --> 2:37:53.040\n if it's operating within ethical bounds,\n\n2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:55.600\n is that yes, it could protect the populace.\n\n2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:59.720\n So you're saying like the good given on your understanding\n\n2:37:59.720 --> 2:38:03.620\n of these institutions, the good outweighs the bad.\n\n2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:06.080\n Absolutely, so let me give you just a practical example.\n\n2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:07.800\n So people don't realize this,\n\n2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:10.440\n but there's multiple surveillance states that are out there.\n\n2:38:10.440 --> 2:38:12.080\n There are surveillance states that are close allies\n\n2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:13.560\n with the United States.\n\n2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:14.720\n One of those surveillance states\n\n2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:18.680\n is the United Arab Emirates, the UAE.\n\n2:38:18.680 --> 2:38:23.320\n Now I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020,\n\n2:38:23.320 --> 2:38:26.720\n came back on a repatriation flight after COVID broke out.\n\n2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:28.160\n And, but we were there for a full year.\n\n2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:31.880\n We were residents, we had IDs, we had everything.\n\n2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:35.200\n Now, when you get your national ID in the Emirates,\n\n2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:39.180\n you get a chip and that chip connects you to everything.\n\n2:38:39.180 --> 2:38:41.100\n It connects you to cameras,\n\n2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:44.080\n it connects you to your license plate on your car,\n\n2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:46.800\n to your passport, to your credit card, everything.\n\n2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:49.520\n Everything is intertwined, everything is interlinked.\n\n2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:51.060\n When you drive, there are no police.\n\n2:38:51.060 --> 2:38:52.520\n There are no police on the roads.\n\n2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:56.440\n Every 50 to 100 meters, you cross a camera\n\n2:38:56.440 --> 2:38:59.240\n that reads your license plate, measures your speed.\n\n2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:00.780\n And if you're breaking the speed limit,\n\n2:39:00.780 --> 2:39:02.800\n it just immediately charges your credit card\n\n2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:04.520\n because it's tied, it's all tied together.\n\n2:39:04.520 --> 2:39:05.760\n Totally surveillance.\n\n2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:08.760\n That technology was invented by the Israelis\n\n2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:10.960\n who use it in Israel.\n\n2:39:13.080 --> 2:39:17.100\n When I was in Abu Dhabi and I was rear ended at high speed\n\n2:39:17.100 --> 2:39:19.760\n by what turned out to be an Emirati official,\n\n2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:23.260\n a senior ranking official of one of the Emirates.\n\n2:39:23.260 --> 2:39:25.080\n It was caught on camera.\n\n2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:27.380\n His ID was registered, my ID was registered.\n\n2:39:27.380 --> 2:39:28.960\n Everything was tied back to our IDs.\n\n2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:31.760\n The proof and the evidence was crystal clear.\n\n2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:34.620\n Even still, he was Emirati, I was not.\n\n2:39:34.620 --> 2:39:37.580\n So when I went to the police station to file the complaints,\n\n2:39:37.580 --> 2:39:39.920\n it was something that nobody was comfortable with\n\n2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:41.160\n because generally speaking,\n\n2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:45.080\n Emiratis don't accept legal claims\n\n2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:46.800\n against their own from foreigners.\n\n2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:48.800\n But the difference was that I was an American\n\n2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:50.120\n and I was there on a contract\n\n2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:51.720\n supporting the Emirati government.\n\n2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:54.640\n So I had these different variances, right?\n\n2:39:54.640 --> 2:39:57.160\n Long story short, in the end,\n\n2:39:57.160 --> 2:39:59.800\n the surveillance state is what made sure\n\n2:39:59.800 --> 2:40:01.840\n that justice was played\n\n2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:06.280\n because the proof was incontrovertible.\n\n2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:09.320\n There was so much evidence collected\n\n2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:11.340\n because of the surveillance nature of their state.\n\n2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:12.920\n Now, why do they have a surveillance state?\n\n2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:14.400\n It's not for people like me.\n\n2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:16.660\n It's because they're constantly afraid\n\n2:40:16.660 --> 2:40:21.360\n of extremist terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi\n\n2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:22.860\n or inside the UAE\n\n2:40:22.860 --> 2:40:25.200\n because they're under constant threat from Islam\n\n2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:26.980\n and they're from extremists\n\n2:40:26.980 --> 2:40:28.640\n and they're under constant threat from Iran.\n\n2:40:28.640 --> 2:40:32.080\n So that's what drives the people to want a police state,\n\n2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:33.680\n to want a surveillance state.\n\n2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:36.480\n For them, their survival is paramount\n\n2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:38.760\n and they need the surveillance to have that survival.\n\n2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:43.400\n For us, we haven't tasted that level of desperation and fear\n\n2:40:43.400 --> 2:40:45.160\n yet or hopefully never,\n\n2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:46.260\n but that's what makes us feel\n\n2:40:46.260 --> 2:40:48.920\n like there's something wrong with surveillance.\n\n2:40:48.920 --> 2:40:50.560\n Surveillance is all about the purpose.\n\n2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:52.140\n It's all about the intent.\n\n2:40:52.140 --> 2:40:53.980\n Well, and like you said,\n\n2:40:53.980 --> 2:40:56.680\n companies do a significant amount of surveillance\n\n2:40:56.680 --> 2:41:00.440\n to provide us with services that we take for granted.\n\n2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:04.200\n For example, just one of the things to give props\n\n2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:06.160\n to the digital efforts\n\n2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:08.480\n of the Zelensky administration in Ukraine.\n\n2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:09.740\n I don't know if you're aware,\n\n2:41:09.740 --> 2:41:12.880\n but they have this digital transformation efforts\n\n2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:17.880\n where you could put, there's an, it's laughable to say\n\n2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:20.460\n in the United States,\n\n2:41:20.460 --> 2:41:22.020\n but they actually did a really good job\n\n2:41:22.020 --> 2:41:25.760\n by having a government app that has your passport on it.\n\n2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:27.120\n It's all the digital information.\n\n2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:28.960\n You can get a doctor.\n\n2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:31.720\n It's like everything that you would think America\n\n2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:35.740\n would be doing, like license, like all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:36.800\n it's in an app.\n\n2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:39.600\n You could pay, there's payment to each other.\n\n2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:41.440\n And that's all coming, I mean,\n\n2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:43.280\n there's probably contractors somehow connected\n\n2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:44.160\n to the whole thing,\n\n2:41:44.160 --> 2:41:46.800\n but that's like under the flag of government.\n\n2:41:46.800 --> 2:41:49.320\n And so that's an incredible technology.\n\n2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:53.040\n And I didn't, I guess, hear anybody talk about surveillance\n\n2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:56.240\n in that context, even though it is, but they all love it.\n\n2:41:56.240 --> 2:41:57.200\n And it's super easy.\n\n2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:00.760\n And they, frankly already, it's so easy and convenient.\n\n2:42:00.760 --> 2:42:02.720\n They've already taken for granted that,\n\n2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:04.440\n of course, this is what you do.\n\n2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:06.680\n Of course, your passport is on your phone.\n\n2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:09.180\n For everybody to have housed in a server\n\n2:42:09.180 --> 2:42:10.640\n that you have no idea where it's at,\n\n2:42:10.640 --> 2:42:13.240\n that could be hacked at any time by a third party.\n\n2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:14.720\n They don't ask these kinds of questions\n\n2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:16.040\n because it's so convenient,\n\n2:42:16.040 --> 2:42:21.040\n as we do for Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple,\n\n2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:27.080\n Microsoft products we use.\n\n2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:29.280\n Security and convenience are on two opposite sides\n\n2:42:29.280 --> 2:42:30.840\n of another spectrum.\n\n2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:33.240\n The more convenient something is, the less secure.\n\n2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:36.240\n And the more secure something is, the less convenient.\n\n2:42:36.240 --> 2:42:39.580\n And that's a battle that we're always working\n\n2:42:39.580 --> 2:42:41.280\n with as individuals, and then we're trying\n\n2:42:41.280 --> 2:42:43.440\n to outsource that battle to our politicians.\n\n2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:44.560\n And our politicians are, frankly,\n\n2:42:44.560 --> 2:42:46.820\n just more interested in being politicians.\n\n2:42:46.820 --> 2:42:49.120\n Yeah, that said, I mean, people are really worried\n\n2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:54.120\n about giving any one institution a large amount of power,\n\n2:42:54.800 --> 2:42:59.800\n especially when it's a federal government institution,\n\n2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:02.000\n given some history.\n\n2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:04.980\n First of all, just history of the corruption,\n\n2:43:04.980 --> 2:43:08.640\n of power corrupting individuals and institutions.\n\n2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:13.640\n And second of all, myth or reality of certain institutions\n\n2:43:15.300 --> 2:43:17.760\n like the CIA misbehaving.\n\n2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:20.720\n Well, let me actually ask you about the Edward Snowden.\n\n2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:25.720\n So you, outside of the utility that you're arguing for\n\n2:43:26.340 --> 2:43:29.160\n of the NSA surveillance program,\n\n2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:34.160\n do you think Edward Snowden is a criminal or a hero?\n\n2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:38.180\n In terms, in the eyes of the law, he's a criminal.\n\n2:43:38.180 --> 2:43:41.120\n He broke the law, he broke the confidence,\n\n2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:43.760\n he made us, he was under security obligation.\n\n2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:45.500\n And then when he ran away, he ran away\n\n2:43:45.500 --> 2:43:47.760\n to all of the worst villains in the world\n\n2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:52.620\n from the US perspective to basically seek protection.\n\n2:43:53.580 --> 2:43:58.580\n That's how you act in the face of accusation\n\n2:43:59.560 --> 2:44:03.400\n is in essence part of the case that you build for yourself.\n\n2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:07.120\n So running away to China, Russia, Cuba,\n\n2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:09.920\n there was a Latin Ecuador, I think,\n\n2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:11.880\n that just paints a very negative picture\n\n2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:13.600\n that does not suggest that you were doing anything\n\n2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:14.720\n that was ethical and upright\n\n2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:16.200\n and in favor of the American people\n\n2:44:16.200 --> 2:44:19.480\n if you're gonna run to American enemies to support yourself.\n\n2:44:19.480 --> 2:44:22.580\n So for sure, in the eyes of law, he's a criminal.\n\n2:44:22.580 --> 2:44:26.240\n In the eyes of a group of people\n\n2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:30.920\n who are largely ignorant to what they lost,\n\n2:44:30.920 --> 2:44:32.720\n to them, he's a hero.\n\n2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:35.320\n To me, he's just kind of a sad case.\n\n2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:40.320\n I personally look at Snowden as a sad, unfortunate case.\n\n2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:45.160\n His life is ruined, his family name is tarnished.\n\n2:44:46.220 --> 2:44:50.140\n He's forever going to be a desperate pawn.\n\n2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:54.400\n And that's all because of the decisions that he made\n\n2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:55.600\n and the order that he made them.\n\n2:44:55.600 --> 2:44:57.220\n I'm not sure his name is tarnished.\n\n2:44:57.220 --> 2:45:01.480\n I think the case you're making is a difficult case to make.\n\n2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:06.480\n And so I think his name represents fighting one man,\n\n2:45:08.360 --> 2:45:11.400\n it's like Tiananmen Square standing before the tank,\n\n2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:15.760\n is like one man fighting the government.\n\n2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:18.120\n And I think that there is some aspect\n\n2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:21.680\n which, taking that case aside,\n\n2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:24.760\n that is the American spirit,\n\n2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:28.960\n which is hold the powerful accountable.\n\n2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:31.400\n So whenever there's somebody in power,\n\n2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:34.620\n one individual can change.\n\n2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:39.440\n One man can make a difference.\n\n2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:40.720\n Can make a difference, yeah.\n\n2:45:40.720 --> 2:45:42.320\n Very Knight Rider of you.\n\n2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:45.240\n I mean, that's the American individualism.\n\n2:45:45.240 --> 2:45:46.720\n And so he represents that.\n\n2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:49.640\n And I think there's a huge skepticism\n\n2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:52.960\n against large federal institutions.\n\n2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:56.560\n And I think if you look at the long arc of history,\n\n2:45:56.560 --> 2:45:58.960\n that actually is a forcing function\n\n2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:01.920\n for the institutions to behave their best.\n\n2:46:01.920 --> 2:46:06.120\n So basically hold them accountable.\n\n2:46:08.160 --> 2:46:11.280\n What's nice about this is that we can agree to disagree\n\n2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:13.680\n and history will be the one that decides.\n\n2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:18.680\n But there's a reason that Edward Snowden\n\n2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:23.120\n needs to do something new every 16 or 18 months\n\n2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:25.800\n to remain relevant, right?\n\n2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:28.560\n Because if he didn't, he would just be forgotten.\n\n2:46:28.560 --> 2:46:30.640\n Because he was not a maverick\n\n2:46:30.640 --> 2:46:32.760\n who changed history for the better.\n\n2:46:32.760 --> 2:46:37.480\n He was a man who broke a law and now he's on the run.\n\n2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:41.060\n And to some people, he is a hero.\n\n2:46:41.060 --> 2:46:42.880\n To other people, he is a criminal.\n\n2:46:42.880 --> 2:46:46.560\n But to the vast majority, he's just a blip\n\n2:46:46.560 --> 2:46:48.320\n on a radar of their everyday life\n\n2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:50.680\n that really makes no difference to them at all.\n\n2:46:50.680 --> 2:46:51.980\n So actually let's linger on that.\n\n2:46:51.980 --> 2:46:54.420\n So just to clarify, do you think,\n\n2:46:54.420 --> 2:46:57.620\n are you making the difficult case\n\n2:46:57.620 --> 2:47:00.780\n that the NSA mass surveillance program\n\n2:47:00.780 --> 2:47:04.980\n was one, ethical and two, made a better world for Americans?\n\n2:47:04.980 --> 2:47:08.260\n I am making the case that at the time,\n\n2:47:08.260 --> 2:47:13.100\n it was exactly what we needed to feel safe in our own homes.\n\n2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:16.500\n But what about to be safe, actually be safe?\n\n2:47:16.500 --> 2:47:19.080\n So this is what's difficult because any proof\n\n2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:20.920\n that was that they collected\n\n2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:23.500\n that actually prevented an attack from happening\n\n2:47:23.500 --> 2:47:24.900\n is proof we'll never know about.\n\n2:47:24.900 --> 2:47:27.480\n This is the really unfortunate side\n\n2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:28.500\n of intelligence operations.\n\n2:47:28.500 --> 2:47:30.500\n And I've been at the front end of this.\n\n2:47:30.500 --> 2:47:32.220\n You work your ass off.\n\n2:47:32.220 --> 2:47:33.700\n You take personal risk.\n\n2:47:33.700 --> 2:47:35.740\n You make personal sacrifice to make sure\n\n2:47:35.740 --> 2:47:38.260\n that something terrible doesn't happen.\n\n2:47:38.260 --> 2:47:39.980\n Nobody knows that that ever happens.\n\n2:47:39.980 --> 2:47:41.620\n Does that have to be that way?\n\n2:47:41.620 --> 2:47:44.800\n Does it have to remain secret\n\n2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:49.800\n every time the NSA or the CIA saves the lives of Americans?\n\n2:47:50.980 --> 2:47:52.140\n It does for two reasons.\n\n2:47:52.140 --> 2:47:52.980\n It has to be secret.\n\n2:47:52.980 --> 2:47:55.540\n First, the mythos.\n\n2:47:55.540 --> 2:47:58.940\n The same thing we were talking about with General Petraeus.\n\n2:47:58.940 --> 2:48:01.560\n You can't brag about your victories\n\n2:48:01.560 --> 2:48:05.300\n if you want to let the myth shape itself.\n\n2:48:05.300 --> 2:48:06.240\n You can't do that.\n\n2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:11.240\n The second thing is once a victory is claimed,\n\n2:48:14.300 --> 2:48:17.460\n the danger comes from letting your enemy know\n\n2:48:17.460 --> 2:48:19.060\n that you claimed the victory\n\n2:48:19.060 --> 2:48:20.260\n because they can reverse engineer\n\n2:48:20.260 --> 2:48:22.540\n and they can start to change how they did things.\n\n2:48:22.540 --> 2:48:25.020\n If a terrorist act, if a terrorist cell tries\n\n2:48:25.020 --> 2:48:27.620\n to execute an operation and the operation fails,\n\n2:48:27.620 --> 2:48:29.600\n from their point of view, they don't know why it failed.\n\n2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:30.780\n They just know that it failed.\n\n2:48:30.780 --> 2:48:33.580\n But then if the US or if the American government comes in\n\n2:48:33.580 --> 2:48:37.760\n and says, we took apart this amazing attack,\n\n2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:39.940\n now they have more information, right?\n\n2:48:39.940 --> 2:48:41.860\n The whole power of secrets, like we talked about before,\n\n2:48:41.860 --> 2:48:43.500\n the power of secrets is in knowing\n\n2:48:43.500 --> 2:48:44.660\n that not everybody has them.\n\n2:48:44.660 --> 2:48:46.700\n There's only a shelf life.\n\n2:48:46.700 --> 2:48:48.340\n So take advantage of the shelf life.\n\n2:48:48.340 --> 2:48:49.820\n You get space.\n\n2:48:49.820 --> 2:48:51.340\n So you gotta keep it a secret.\n\n2:48:51.340 --> 2:48:56.140\n There is no tactical advantage from sharing a secret\n\n2:48:56.140 --> 2:48:59.980\n unless you are specifically trying to achieve\n\n2:48:59.980 --> 2:49:01.940\n a certain tactical advantage from sharing that secret,\n\n2:49:01.940 --> 2:49:03.100\n which is what we've seen so much of\n\n2:49:03.100 --> 2:49:05.180\n with US intel sharing with Ukraine.\n\n2:49:05.180 --> 2:49:07.340\n There's a tactical advantage from sharing a secret\n\n2:49:07.340 --> 2:49:10.740\n about Russian military movements or weaknesses in tanks\n\n2:49:10.740 --> 2:49:14.100\n or supply chain challenges, whatever it might be.\n\n2:49:14.100 --> 2:49:16.340\n Well, let me argue that there might be an advantage\n\n2:49:16.340 --> 2:49:19.820\n to share information with the American public\n\n2:49:19.820 --> 2:49:24.820\n when a terrorist attack or is averted\n\n2:49:25.700 --> 2:49:28.460\n or the lives of Americans are saved,\n\n2:49:28.460 --> 2:49:30.060\n because what that does.\n\n2:49:30.060 --> 2:49:33.120\n Is make every American think that they're not that safe.\n\n2:49:34.080 --> 2:49:36.420\n There is no tactical advantage there.\n\n2:49:36.420 --> 2:49:37.260\n You think so?\n\n2:49:37.260 --> 2:49:38.100\n Absolutely.\n\n2:49:38.100 --> 2:49:38.920\n What about?\n\n2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:43.920\n If the Austin PD started telling you every day\n\n2:49:44.060 --> 2:49:48.140\n about these crazy crimes that they prevented,\n\n2:49:48.140 --> 2:49:49.860\n would that make you feel more safe?\n\n2:49:49.860 --> 2:49:51.460\n It would make you feel like they're doing their job.\n\n2:49:51.460 --> 2:49:53.620\n Is that obvious to you, make us feel less safe?\n\n2:49:53.620 --> 2:49:55.620\n Because if we see competence,\n\n2:49:55.620 --> 2:49:59.900\n that there is extremely competent defenders\n\n2:49:59.900 --> 2:50:02.940\n of this territory of these people,\n\n2:50:02.940 --> 2:50:05.060\n wouldn't that make us feel more safe or no?\n\n2:50:05.060 --> 2:50:08.880\n The human nature is not to assign competence.\n\n2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:13.880\n So empirically, humans overvalue losses\n\n2:50:14.980 --> 2:50:17.140\n and undervalue gains.\n\n2:50:17.140 --> 2:50:19.220\n That's something that we've seen from finance\n\n2:50:19.220 --> 2:50:20.480\n to betting and beyond.\n\n2:50:21.500 --> 2:50:23.580\n If the Austin Police Department starts telling you\n\n2:50:23.580 --> 2:50:26.780\n about all these heinous crimes that were avoided\n\n2:50:26.780 --> 2:50:28.960\n because of their hard work,\n\n2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:30.740\n the way that your brain is actually going\n\n2:50:30.740 --> 2:50:33.620\n to process that information is you are going to say,\n\n2:50:33.620 --> 2:50:36.860\n if this is all the stuff that they've stopped,\n\n2:50:36.860 --> 2:50:39.700\n how bad must this place be?\n\n2:50:39.700 --> 2:50:41.940\n How much more haven't they stopped?\n\n2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:45.380\n I take your point, it's a powerful psychological point,\n\n2:50:45.380 --> 2:50:49.200\n but looking at the other picture of it,\n\n2:50:49.200 --> 2:50:52.640\n looking at the police force, looking at the CIA, the NSA,\n\n2:50:53.720 --> 2:50:56.680\n those people, now with the police,\n\n2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:00.020\n they're seeing, there's such a negative feeling\n\n2:51:00.020 --> 2:51:03.460\n amongst Americans towards these institutions.\n\n2:51:03.460 --> 2:51:06.620\n Who the hell wants to work for the CIA now\n\n2:51:06.620 --> 2:51:07.940\n and the police force?\n\n2:51:07.940 --> 2:51:12.540\n Like, you're gonna be criticized,\n\n2:51:12.540 --> 2:51:16.980\n like that's a, I mean, that's really bad for the CIA.\n\n2:51:16.980 --> 2:51:18.100\n It's terrible.\n\n2:51:18.100 --> 2:51:20.500\n Like, as opposed to being seen as a hero,\n\n2:51:20.500 --> 2:51:25.060\n like for example, currently soldiers are for the most part\n\n2:51:25.060 --> 2:51:27.380\n seen as heroes that are protecting this nation.\n\n2:51:30.220 --> 2:51:32.700\n That's not the case for the CIA.\n\n2:51:32.700 --> 2:51:36.840\n Soldiers weren't seen as heroes in the Vietnam War, right?\n\n2:51:36.840 --> 2:51:39.480\n You've got to remember that when you,\n\n2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:43.580\n so first of all, public service is a sacrifice.\n\n2:51:43.580 --> 2:51:45.260\n We oftentimes forget that.\n\n2:51:45.260 --> 2:51:47.300\n We start to think, oh, government jobs are cushy\n\n2:51:47.300 --> 2:51:49.360\n and they're easy, and it must be so easy\n\n2:51:49.360 --> 2:51:50.200\n to be the president,\n\n2:51:50.200 --> 2:51:52.980\n because then you're basically a celebrity overnight.\n\n2:51:52.980 --> 2:51:56.720\n Public service is a sacrifice, it's a grind.\n\n2:51:57.700 --> 2:52:02.300\n For all of the soldiers, the submariners,\n\n2:52:02.300 --> 2:52:05.020\n the missileers, the police officers,\n\n2:52:05.020 --> 2:52:06.540\n intelligence specialists,\n\n2:52:06.540 --> 2:52:09.020\n they all know what it's like to give things up,\n\n2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:12.620\n to serve a public that can turn its opinion\n\n2:52:12.620 --> 2:52:14.620\n at any given time.\n\n2:52:14.620 --> 2:52:16.900\n And history is what defines it.\n\n2:52:16.900 --> 2:52:19.060\n The more important thing is to understand that\n\n2:52:19.060 --> 2:52:22.300\n if you want a true open and fair democracy,\n\n2:52:22.300 --> 2:52:25.300\n you cannot control a narrative.\n\n2:52:25.300 --> 2:52:27.580\n And starting to share all of your victories\n\n2:52:27.580 --> 2:52:29.460\n or starting to share your biggest victories\n\n2:52:29.460 --> 2:52:31.620\n with the intent of shaping public opinion\n\n2:52:31.620 --> 2:52:35.380\n to be supportive of the police force or supportive of CIA\n\n2:52:35.380 --> 2:52:39.180\n or supportive of you name it, is shaping a narrative\n\n2:52:39.180 --> 2:52:43.280\n that is intentional operational use of influence\n\n2:52:43.280 --> 2:52:45.540\n to drive public opinion.\n\n2:52:45.540 --> 2:52:47.660\n That is something nobody wants to get into.\n\n2:52:47.660 --> 2:52:50.400\n It is much more professional to be a silent sentinel,\n\n2:52:50.400 --> 2:52:54.140\n a silent servant, humbly carrying the burden\n\n2:52:54.140 --> 2:52:56.040\n of public service in the United States\n\n2:52:56.040 --> 2:52:59.220\n where we are a fair and open democracy.\n\n2:52:59.220 --> 2:53:04.220\n Why, why not celebrate the killing of Bin Laden?\n\n2:53:04.220 --> 2:53:05.060\n We did.\n\n2:53:05.060 --> 2:53:06.840\n The search, discovery, and the capture\n\n2:53:06.840 --> 2:53:08.380\n and the killing of Bin Laden.\n\n2:53:08.380 --> 2:53:10.640\n Wasn't that, actually the details of that,\n\n2:53:10.640 --> 2:53:12.520\n how much of the details of that,\n\n2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:15.440\n how he was discovered were made public?\n\n2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:17.520\n I think some of it was made public enough.\n\n2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:19.080\n Why not do that?\n\n2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:21.500\n Doesn't that make heroes out of the people\n\n2:53:21.500 --> 2:53:23.480\n that are servants?\n\n2:53:23.480 --> 2:53:28.480\n Or do people who serve to do service for this nation,\n\n2:53:28.800 --> 2:53:30.840\n do they always have to operate\n\n2:53:30.840 --> 2:53:34.600\n in a thankless manner in the shadows?\n\n2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:36.920\n I think that's a very good question.\n\n2:53:36.920 --> 2:53:41.840\n The folks who I left behind when I left CIA,\n\n2:53:41.840 --> 2:53:45.720\n who continue to serve as faceless,\n\n2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:50.100\n nameless heroes every day, I am grateful to them.\n\n2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:56.760\n The truth is that if they were motivated by something else,\n\n2:53:56.760 --> 2:53:59.800\n they wouldn't be as good as they are at doing what they do.\n\n2:53:59.800 --> 2:54:03.980\n And I see your point about,\n\n2:54:03.980 --> 2:54:07.020\n shouldn't we be celebrating our victories?\n\n2:54:07.020 --> 2:54:09.040\n But when celebrating our victories\n\n2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:14.040\n runs the risk of informing our enemies how we operate,\n\n2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:17.020\n giving away our informational advantage,\n\n2:54:17.020 --> 2:54:19.220\n giving away our tactical battlefield advantage,\n\n2:54:19.220 --> 2:54:22.280\n and running the risk of shaping a narrative intentionally\n\n2:54:22.280 --> 2:54:24.100\n among our own American people,\n\n2:54:24.100 --> 2:54:27.440\n now all of a sudden we're turning into exactly the thing\n\n2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:30.320\n that the American people trust us not to become.\n\n2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:34.200\n Yeah, but then you operate in the secrecy,\n\n2:54:34.200 --> 2:54:39.040\n and then there's corrupt and douchebag people everywhere.\n\n2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:42.960\n So when they, even inside the CIA and criminals,\n\n2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:45.940\n inside the CIA there's criminals in all organizations,\n\n2:54:45.940 --> 2:54:48.680\n in all walks of life, human nature as such,\n\n2:54:48.680 --> 2:54:50.460\n that this is always the case,\n\n2:54:50.460 --> 2:54:53.240\n then it breeds conspiracy theories.\n\n2:54:53.240 --> 2:54:54.760\n It does.\n\n2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:56.340\n And sometimes those conspiracy theories\n\n2:54:56.340 --> 2:54:57.560\n turn out to be true.\n\n2:54:57.560 --> 2:54:59.780\n But most times they don't.\n\n2:54:59.780 --> 2:55:02.680\n That's just part of the risk of being a myth.\n\n2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:05.880\n Can you speak to some of the myths?\n\n2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:08.840\n So MKUltra, so.\n\n2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:09.800\n Not a myth.\n\n2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:10.820\n Not a myth.\n\n2:55:10.820 --> 2:55:14.520\n So this is a fascinating human experimentation program\n\n2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:17.400\n undertaken by the CIA to develop procedures\n\n2:55:17.400 --> 2:55:20.820\n for using drugs like LSD to interrogate people\n\n2:55:20.820 --> 2:55:23.960\n through, let's say, psychological manipulation\n\n2:55:23.960 --> 2:55:25.900\n and maybe even torture.\n\n2:55:25.900 --> 2:55:28.520\n The scale of the program is perhaps not known.\n\n2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:32.000\n How do you make sense that this program existed?\n\n2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:33.780\n Again, you've gotta look through the lens of time.\n\n2:55:33.780 --> 2:55:35.480\n You've gotta look at where we were historically\n\n2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:36.320\n at that time.\n\n2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:38.480\n There was the peak of the Cold War.\n\n2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:41.880\n Our enemies were doing the same kind of experimentation.\n\n2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:44.440\n It was essentially another space race.\n\n2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:49.000\n What if they broke through a new weapon technology\n\n2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:50.240\n faster than we did?\n\n2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:52.240\n What would that mean for the safety and security\n\n2:55:52.240 --> 2:55:54.760\n of the American people?\n\n2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:57.400\n So right decision or wrong decision,\n\n2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:00.040\n it was guided by and informed\n\n2:56:00.040 --> 2:56:02.160\n by national security priorities.\n\n2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:06.640\n So from this program that was designed to use drugs\n\n2:56:06.640 --> 2:56:08.800\n to drive interrogation and torture people\n\n2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:12.600\n was born something very productive, Operation Stargate,\n\n2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:17.480\n which was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics\n\n2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:19.200\n to try to collect intelligence.\n\n2:56:19.200 --> 2:56:23.600\n Now, even though in the end, the outcome of MKUltra\n\n2:56:23.600 --> 2:56:25.540\n and the outcome of Stargate were mixed,\n\n2:56:25.540 --> 2:56:27.040\n nobody really knows if they did or didn't do\n\n2:56:27.040 --> 2:56:28.480\n what they were supposed to do,\n\n2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:30.400\n we still know that to this day,\n\n2:56:30.400 --> 2:56:34.080\n there's still a demand in the US government and in CIA\n\n2:56:34.080 --> 2:56:38.080\n for people who have sensitivities to ethereal energies.\n\n2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:40.680\n By the way, is there any proof\n\n2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:41.800\n that that kind of stuff works?\n\n2:56:41.800 --> 2:56:46.320\n Or it just shows that there's interest.\n\n2:56:46.320 --> 2:56:47.960\n It shows that there's openness\n\n2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:49.700\n to consider those kinds of things.\n\n2:56:49.700 --> 2:56:51.720\n But is there any evidence that that kind of stuff works?\n\n2:56:51.720 --> 2:56:53.620\n If there's evidence, I haven't seen it.\n\n2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:58.880\n Speaking from a science based point of view only,\n\n2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:03.000\n if energy and matter can always be exchanged,\n\n2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:05.880\n then a person who can understand\n\n2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:09.040\n and become sensitive to energy\n\n2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:11.520\n is a person who could become sensitive\n\n2:57:11.520 --> 2:57:13.680\n to what does become matter.\n\n2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:17.460\n Yeah, I mean, the basics of the physics might be there,\n\n2:57:17.460 --> 2:57:20.000\n but a lot of people probably are skeptical.\n\n2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:21.640\n I'm skeptical too, but I'm just trying to look at it.\n\n2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:23.040\n You should be open minded, right?\n\n2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:26.320\n I mean, that's actually, you know,\n\n2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:28.680\n that's what science is about, is remain open minded,\n\n2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:30.560\n even for the things that are long shots,\n\n2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:31.520\n because those are the things\n\n2:57:31.520 --> 2:57:34.400\n that actually define scientific revolutions.\n\n2:57:34.400 --> 2:57:37.600\n What about Operation Northwoods?\n\n2:57:37.600 --> 2:57:41.600\n It was a proposed 1962 false flag operation\n\n2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:46.600\n by the DOD and the CIA to be carried out by the CIA\n\n2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:50.400\n to commit acts of terrorism on Americans\n\n2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:52.280\n and blame them on Cuba.\n\n2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:55.760\n So JFK, the president, rejected the proposal.\n\n2:57:55.760 --> 2:57:58.080\n What do you make that this was on the table,\n\n2:57:58.080 --> 2:57:59.360\n Operation Northwoods?\n\n2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:00.760\n So it's interesting.\n\n2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:02.920\n First, I'm glad that JFK rejected it.\n\n2:58:02.920 --> 2:58:05.440\n That's a good sign.\n\n2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:09.120\n So we have to understand that good ideas\n\n2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:12.100\n are oftentimes born from bad ideas.\n\n2:58:12.100 --> 2:58:14.240\n I had a really good friend of mine\n\n2:58:14.240 --> 2:58:16.920\n who actually went on to become a pastor,\n\n2:58:16.920 --> 2:58:18.560\n and he used to say all the time\n\n2:58:18.560 --> 2:58:20.440\n that he wanted all the bad ideas on the table.\n\n2:58:20.440 --> 2:58:21.880\n Like, give me all your bad ideas\n\n2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:23.920\n every time we had any kind of conversation.\n\n2:58:23.920 --> 2:58:25.400\n And I was always one of those people who was like,\n\n2:58:25.400 --> 2:58:28.000\n isn't a bad idea just a waste of time?\n\n2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:28.840\n And he was like, no,\n\n2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:31.360\n because the best ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas.\n\n2:58:31.360 --> 2:58:35.040\n So again, Cuban missile crisis,\n\n2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:36.960\n mass hysteria in the United States\n\n2:58:36.960 --> 2:58:38.520\n about nuclear war from Cuba,\n\n2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:41.160\n missiles blowing up American cities faster\n\n2:58:41.160 --> 2:58:43.040\n than we could even see them coming.\n\n2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:45.960\n It makes sense to me that a president would go to,\n\n2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:48.520\n especially the part of CIA,\n\n2:58:48.520 --> 2:58:51.440\n which is the Special Activities Division,\n\n2:58:51.440 --> 2:58:52.280\n it makes perfect sense to me\n\n2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:54.040\n that the president would go to a division\n\n2:58:54.040 --> 2:58:55.320\n called Special Activities,\n\n2:58:55.320 --> 2:58:59.560\n whose job it is to create crazy ideas\n\n2:58:59.560 --> 2:59:02.460\n that have presidential approval,\n\n2:59:02.460 --> 2:59:04.600\n but nobody knows they exist.\n\n2:59:04.600 --> 2:59:07.080\n So it makes sense that he would challenge a group like that\n\n2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:09.320\n to come up with any wacky idea, right?\n\n2:59:09.320 --> 2:59:10.140\n Come up with anything.\n\n2:59:10.140 --> 2:59:11.440\n Just let's start with something,\n\n2:59:11.440 --> 2:59:13.820\n because we can't bring nothing to the table.\n\n2:59:13.820 --> 2:59:15.760\n We have to do something about this Cuban issue.\n\n2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:17.720\n And then that's how an operation like that\n\n2:59:17.720 --> 2:59:19.200\n could reasonably be born.\n\n2:59:19.200 --> 2:59:20.860\n Not because anybody wants to do it,\n\n2:59:20.860 --> 2:59:22.480\n but because they were tasked by the president\n\n2:59:22.480 --> 2:59:24.820\n to come up with five ideas.\n\n2:59:24.820 --> 2:59:26.520\n And it was one of the ideas.\n\n2:59:27.600 --> 2:59:29.560\n That still happens to this day.\n\n2:59:29.560 --> 2:59:31.120\n The president will still come in,\n\n2:59:31.120 --> 2:59:33.000\n but it'll basically send out a notice\n\n2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:34.840\n to his covert action arm.\n\n2:59:34.840 --> 2:59:38.080\n And he will say, I need this.\n\n2:59:38.080 --> 2:59:39.600\n And I need it on Wednesday.\n\n2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:41.920\n And people have to come back with options\n\n2:59:41.920 --> 2:59:44.400\n for the thing he asked for, a finding.\n\n2:59:44.400 --> 2:59:46.440\n He will issue a presidential finding.\n\n2:59:46.440 --> 2:59:48.640\n And then his covert action arms have to come back and say,\n\n2:59:48.640 --> 2:59:49.840\n here's how we would do this\n\n2:59:49.840 --> 2:59:51.640\n and hide the hands of the Americans.\n\n2:59:53.000 --> 2:59:55.520\n How gangster was it of JFK to reject it though?\n\n2:59:55.520 --> 2:59:56.520\n His baller, right?\n\n2:59:57.480 --> 3:00:00.040\n That's like, that is a mic drop right there.\n\n3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:01.520\n Nope, not doing that.\n\n3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:02.360\n Yep, doing that.\n\n3:00:03.680 --> 3:00:07.440\n A thing that crosses an ethical line,\n\n3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:10.880\n even in a time where the human,\n\n3:00:10.880 --> 3:00:13.640\n the entirety of human civilization hangs in a balance,\n\n3:00:13.640 --> 3:00:16.160\n still forfeit that power.\n\n3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:20.560\n That's a beautiful thing about the American experiment.\n\n3:00:20.560 --> 3:00:22.560\n That's a few times throughout the history\n\n3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:23.840\n that this has happened,\n\n3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:27.000\n including with our first president, George Washington.\n\n3:00:28.160 --> 3:00:30.280\n Well, let me ask about JFK.\n\n3:00:30.280 --> 3:00:35.280\n 25 times two, and they still keep that stuff classified.\n\n3:00:35.280 --> 3:00:40.280\n So do you think the CIA had a hand\n\n3:00:40.880 --> 3:00:43.680\n in the assassination of JFK?\n\n3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:48.680\n I cannot imagine in any reasonable point of view\n\n3:00:48.680 --> 3:00:51.560\n that the organization of CIA had anything to do\n\n3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:53.120\n with the assassination of JFK.\n\n3:00:53.120 --> 3:00:57.160\n So it's not possible to infiltrate the CIA,\n\n3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:02.160\n a small part of the CIA in order to attain political\n\n3:01:02.160 --> 3:01:07.160\n or criminal gains, or financial.\n\n3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:10.840\n Yeah, absolutely it's possible to infiltrate CIA.\n\n3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:14.640\n There's a long history of foreign intelligence services\n\n3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:17.480\n infiltrating CIA, from Aldrich Ames\n\n3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:20.520\n to Jerry Lee recently with China.\n\n3:01:20.520 --> 3:01:22.680\n So we know CIA can be infiltrated,\n\n3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:25.960\n even if they are infiltrated,\n\n3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:29.640\n and even if that's interlocutor execution\n\n3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:34.640\n that interlocutor executes on their own agenda\n\n3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:39.480\n or the agenda as directed by their foreign adversary,\n\n3:01:39.480 --> 3:01:41.000\n their foreign handler,\n\n3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:45.120\n that's different than organizational support for an event.\n\n3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:47.760\n So I do think it's possible\n\n3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:49.280\n they could have been infiltrated at the time,\n\n3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:52.720\n especially it was a major priority\n\n3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:54.440\n for the Cubans and the Russians\n\n3:01:54.440 --> 3:01:58.560\n to infiltrate some aspect of US intelligence,\n\n3:01:58.560 --> 3:02:03.400\n multiple moles were caught in the years following.\n\n3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:05.480\n So it's not surprising\n\n3:02:05.480 --> 3:02:07.240\n that there would be a priority for that.\n\n3:02:07.240 --> 3:02:09.480\n But to say that the organization of CIA\n\n3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:12.240\n was somehow in cahoots with,\n\n3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:15.160\n to independently assassinate their own executive,\n\n3:02:15.160 --> 3:02:16.680\n that's a significant stretch.\n\n3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:18.680\n I've seen no evidence to support that.\n\n3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:21.520\n And it goes contrary to everything I learned\n\n3:02:21.520 --> 3:02:22.640\n from my time at CIA.\n\n3:02:24.600 --> 3:02:26.120\n Well, let me ask you,\n\n3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:29.840\n do you think CIA played a part in enabling drug cartels\n\n3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:31.240\n and drug trafficking,\n\n3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:33.520\n which is another big kind of\n\n3:02:35.680 --> 3:02:37.920\n shadow that hangs over the CIA?\n\n3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:39.280\n At the beginning of the drug war,\n\n3:02:39.280 --> 3:02:41.040\n I would imagine the answer is yes.\n\n3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:45.200\n CIA has its own counter narcotics division,\n\n3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:47.640\n a division that's dedicated to fighting\n\n3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:49.440\n and preventing narcotics\n\n3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:51.320\n from coming into the United States.\n\n3:02:51.320 --> 3:02:53.440\n So when you paint a picture for me,\n\n3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:56.160\n like do you think the CIA was complicit\n\n3:02:56.160 --> 3:02:59.920\n in helping drug trafficking or drug use?\n\n3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:01.360\n When I say yes,\n\n3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.360\n my exception is I don't think they did that\n\n3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:05.640\n for Americans inside the United States.\n\n3:03:05.640 --> 3:03:07.720\n If the CIA can basically set it up\n\n3:03:07.720 --> 3:03:10.480\n so that two different drug cartels shoot each other\n\n3:03:10.480 --> 3:03:13.520\n by assisting in the transaction\n\n3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:17.960\n of a sale to a third country\n\n3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:20.120\n and then leaking that that sale happened\n\n3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:21.680\n to a competing cartel,\n\n3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:23.800\n that's just letting cartels do what they do.\n\n3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:25.640\n That's them doing the dirty work for us.\n\n3:03:25.640 --> 3:03:27.200\n So especially at the beginning of the drug war,\n\n3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:28.680\n I think there was tons of space,\n\n3:03:28.680 --> 3:03:31.080\n lots of room for CIA to get involved\n\n3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:33.720\n in the economics of drugs\n\n3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:35.400\n and then let the inevitable happen.\n\n3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:36.880\n And that was way more efficient,\n\n3:03:36.880 --> 3:03:40.840\n way more productive than us trying to send our own troops\n\n3:03:40.840 --> 3:03:43.960\n in to kill a bunch of cartel warlords.\n\n3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:45.280\n So that makes a ton of sense to me.\n\n3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:46.120\n It just seems efficient.\n\n3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:47.280\n It seems very practical.\n\n3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:49.480\n I do not believe that CIA would like,\n\n3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:50.880\n I don't think all the accusations out there\n\n3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:53.640\n about how they would buy drugs and sell drugs\n\n3:03:53.640 --> 3:03:55.280\n and somehow make money on the side from it.\n\n3:03:55.280 --> 3:03:56.880\n That's not how it works.\n\n3:03:56.880 --> 3:03:59.680\n So do you think there's, on that point,\n\n3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:01.640\n a connection between Barry Seal,\n\n3:04:02.960 --> 3:04:05.760\n the great governor and then President Bill Clinton,\n\n3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:08.680\n Oliver North and Vice President and former CIA Director\n\n3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:11.800\n George H.W. Bush and the little town\n\n3:04:11.800 --> 3:04:14.920\n with a little airport called Mena, Arkansas?\n\n3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:17.120\n So I am out of my element now.\n\n3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:19.840\n This is one I haven't heard many details about.\n\n3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:24.840\n Okay, so your sense is any of the drug trafficking\n\n3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:28.880\n has to do with criminal operations\n\n3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:30.800\n outside of the United States and the CIA\n\n3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:35.240\n just leveraging that to achieve its ends\n\n3:04:35.240 --> 3:04:37.520\n but nothing to do with American citizens\n\n3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:39.840\n and American politicians.\n\n3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:43.320\n With American citizens, again, speaking organizationally.\n\n3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:45.620\n So that would be my sense, yes.\n\n3:04:45.620 --> 3:04:50.500\n Let me ask you about, so back to Operation Northwoods\n\n3:04:50.500 --> 3:04:55.500\n because it's such a powerful tool,\n\n3:04:55.580 --> 3:04:59.980\n sadly powerful tool used by dictators throughout history,\n\n3:04:59.980 --> 3:05:01.940\n the false flag operation.\n\n3:05:04.940 --> 3:05:09.140\n So I think there's, and you said the terrorist attacks\n\n3:05:09.140 --> 3:05:14.140\n in 9 11 were, it changed a lot for us,\n\n3:05:14.140 --> 3:05:18.580\n for the United States, for Americans.\n\n3:05:18.580 --> 3:05:19.860\n It changed the way we see the world.\n\n3:05:19.860 --> 3:05:22.020\n It woke us up to the harshness of the world.\n\n3:05:22.020 --> 3:05:25.000\n I think there's, to my eyes at least,\n\n3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:27.340\n there's nothing that shows evidence\n\n3:05:27.340 --> 3:05:30.500\n that 9 11 was a quote inside job.\n\n3:05:30.500 --> 3:05:35.500\n But is the CIA or the intelligence agencies\n\n3:05:37.020 --> 3:05:41.300\n or the US government capable of something like that?\n\n3:05:41.300 --> 3:05:42.820\n But that's the question.\n\n3:05:42.820 --> 3:05:46.020\n So there's a bunch of shadiness\n\n3:05:46.020 --> 3:05:47.860\n about how it was reported on.\n\n3:05:47.860 --> 3:05:51.580\n I just can't, that's the thing I struggle with.\n\n3:05:53.860 --> 3:05:57.100\n While there's no evidence that there was an inside job,\n\n3:05:57.100 --> 3:05:59.340\n it raises the question to me,\n\n3:05:59.340 --> 3:06:02.980\n well, could something like this be an inside job?\n\n3:06:02.980 --> 3:06:06.620\n Because it sure as heck, now looking back 20 years,\n\n3:06:06.620 --> 3:06:09.500\n the amount of money that was spent on these wars,\n\n3:06:09.500 --> 3:06:11.700\n the military industrial complex,\n\n3:06:11.700 --> 3:06:15.320\n the amount of interest in terms of power and money involved,\n\n3:06:17.580 --> 3:06:22.580\n organizationally, can something like that happen?\n\n3:06:22.580 --> 3:06:24.180\n You know Occam's razor.\n\n3:06:24.180 --> 3:06:28.140\n So the harem's razor is that you can never prescribe\n\n3:06:28.140 --> 3:06:32.560\n to conspiracy what could be explained through incompetence.\n\n3:06:34.060 --> 3:06:37.300\n That is one of, those are two fundamental guidelines\n\n3:06:37.300 --> 3:06:38.860\n that we follow all the time.\n\n3:06:38.860 --> 3:06:40.700\n The simplest answer is oftentimes the best\n\n3:06:40.700 --> 3:06:43.300\n and never prescribe to conspiracy\n\n3:06:43.300 --> 3:06:44.740\n what can be explained through incompetence.\n\n3:06:44.740 --> 3:06:47.540\n Can you elaborate what you mean by we?\n\n3:06:47.540 --> 3:06:50.860\n We as intelligence professionals.\n\n3:06:50.860 --> 3:06:55.140\n So you think there's a deep truth to that second razor?\n\n3:06:55.140 --> 3:06:57.660\n There is more than a deep truth.\n\n3:06:57.660 --> 3:07:01.900\n There's ages of experience for me and for others.\n\n3:07:01.900 --> 3:07:04.620\n So in general, people are incompetent.\n\n3:07:04.620 --> 3:07:09.060\n If left to their own means they're more incompetent\n\n3:07:09.060 --> 3:07:13.740\n than they are malevolent at a large organizational scale.\n\n3:07:13.740 --> 3:07:17.380\n People are more incompetent of executing a conspiracy\n\n3:07:18.500 --> 3:07:22.440\n than they are of competently, yeah,\n\n3:07:22.440 --> 3:07:25.180\n than they are of competently executing a conspiracy.\n\n3:07:25.180 --> 3:07:28.700\n That's really what it means is that it's so difficult\n\n3:07:28.700 --> 3:07:30.780\n to carry out a complex lie\n\n3:07:30.780 --> 3:07:33.220\n that most people don't have the competency to do it.\n\n3:07:33.220 --> 3:07:36.360\n So it doesn't make any sense to lead thinking of conspiracy.\n\n3:07:36.360 --> 3:07:40.260\n It makes more sense to lead assuming incompetence.\n\n3:07:40.260 --> 3:07:41.880\n When you look at all of the outcomes,\n\n3:07:41.880 --> 3:07:45.060\n all the findings from 9 11, it speaks to incompetence.\n\n3:07:45.060 --> 3:07:48.860\n It speaks brashly and openly to incompetence\n\n3:07:48.860 --> 3:07:50.980\n and nobody likes talking about it.\n\n3:07:50.980 --> 3:07:53.780\n FBI and CIA to this day hate hearing about it.\n\n3:07:53.780 --> 3:07:56.300\n The 9 11 commission is gonna go down in history\n\n3:07:56.300 --> 3:07:58.680\n as this painful example of the incompetence\n\n3:07:58.680 --> 3:08:01.020\n of the American intelligence community.\n\n3:08:01.020 --> 3:08:02.900\n And it's going to come back again and again.\n\n3:08:02.900 --> 3:08:04.180\n Every time there's an intel flap,\n\n3:08:04.180 --> 3:08:06.780\n it's gonna come back again and again.\n\n3:08:06.780 --> 3:08:07.620\n What are you seeing?\n\n3:08:07.620 --> 3:08:12.100\n Even right now, we miss the US intelligence infrastructure,\n\n3:08:12.100 --> 3:08:16.380\n misjudged Afghanistan, misjudged Hong Kong,\n\n3:08:16.380 --> 3:08:20.140\n misjudged Ukraine's and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n3:08:20.140 --> 3:08:22.900\n Those were three massive misjudgments in a few years.\n\n3:08:24.420 --> 3:08:27.360\n That speaks, it's just embarrassing.\n\n3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:28.200\n Exactly right.\n\n3:08:28.200 --> 3:08:33.200\n So all the sort of cover up looking things around 9 11\n\n3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:36.880\n is just people being embarrassed by their failures.\n\n3:08:36.880 --> 3:08:39.240\n If they're taking steps to cover anything up,\n\n3:08:39.240 --> 3:08:43.740\n it's just their own, it's a painful reminder\n\n3:08:43.740 --> 3:08:46.180\n of their lack of competency at the time.\n\n3:08:46.180 --> 3:08:48.680\n Now, I understand that conspiracy theorists\n\n3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:51.900\n want to take inklings of information\n\n3:08:51.900 --> 3:08:55.760\n and put them together in a way that is the most damning,\n\n3:08:55.760 --> 3:08:59.240\n but that goes back to our point about overvaluing losses\n\n3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:00.800\n and undervaluing gains.\n\n3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:03.340\n It's just predictable human behavior.\n\n3:09:03.340 --> 3:09:07.100\n Let me ask you about this because it comes up often.\n\n3:09:07.960 --> 3:09:10.880\n So I'm from MIT and there's a guy by the name\n\n3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:15.000\n of Jeffrey Epstein that still troubles me to this day\n\n3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:17.480\n that some of the people I respect\n\n3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:20.840\n were interacted with this individual\n\n3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:23.840\n and fell into his influence.\n\n3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:28.840\n The charm, charisma, whatever the hell he used\n\n3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:36.960\n to delude these people, he did so successfully.\n\n3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:38.680\n I'm very open minded about this thing.\n\n3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:40.400\n I just, I would love to learn more,\n\n3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:44.640\n but a lot of people tell me, a lot of people I respect,\n\n3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:47.880\n that there's intelligence agencies behind this individual.\n\n3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:50.240\n So they were using Jeffrey Epstein\n\n3:09:50.240 --> 3:09:54.120\n for getting access to powerful people\n\n3:09:54.120 --> 3:09:57.360\n and then to control and manipulate those powerful people.\n\n3:09:57.360 --> 3:10:00.920\n The CIA, I believe, is not brought up as often as Mossad.\n\n3:10:01.840 --> 3:10:04.360\n And so this goes back to the original aspect\n\n3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:06.960\n of our conversation is how much each individual\n\n3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:10.280\n intelligence agency is willing to go to control,\n\n3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:13.500\n to manipulate, to achieve its means.\n\n3:10:13.500 --> 3:10:16.400\n Do you think there is, can you educate me?\n\n3:10:16.400 --> 3:10:21.360\n If, obviously you don't know, but you can bet,\n\n3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:23.960\n what are the chances the intelligence agencies\n\n3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:26.800\n are involved with the character of Jeffrey Epstein?\n\n3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:29.320\n In some way, shape, or form with the character of Epstein,\n\n3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:33.920\n it's 100% guaranteed that some intelligence organization\n\n3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:36.320\n was involved, but let's talk about why.\n\n3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:37.720\n Let's talk about why, okay?\n\n3:10:38.600 --> 3:10:40.940\n There's multiple types of intelligence assets,\n\n3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:43.400\n just like we were talking earlier.\n\n3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:47.200\n There's foreign intelligence reporting assets,\n\n3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:50.040\n there's access agents,\n\n3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:51.920\n and then there's agents of influence.\n\n3:10:51.920 --> 3:10:54.920\n Three different categories of intelligence, right?\n\n3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:58.200\n One is when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters,\n\n3:10:58.200 --> 3:10:59.720\n these are people who have access to secrets\n\n3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:02.000\n and their job is to give you their secrets\n\n3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:04.600\n in exchange for gold or money or alcohol or prostitution\n\n3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:05.440\n or whatever else, right?\n\n3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:07.080\n Their job is to give you secrets\n\n3:11:07.080 --> 3:11:09.120\n and then you pay them for the secrets.\n\n3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:13.440\n Access agents, their job is to give you physical access\n\n3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:17.640\n or digital access to something of interest to you.\n\n3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:19.840\n So maybe they're the ones that open a door\n\n3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:21.320\n that should have been locked and let you come in\n\n3:11:21.320 --> 3:11:23.080\n and stick your thumb drive in the computer.\n\n3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:25.560\n Or maybe they're the ones that share a phone number\n\n3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:27.480\n with somebody and then they're just like,\n\n3:11:27.480 --> 3:11:29.080\n just don't tell them you got the phone number from me.\n\n3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:31.200\n Their job is to give you access.\n\n3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:33.600\n Then you have these agents of influence.\n\n3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:38.600\n An agent of influence's job is to be part of your effort\n\n3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:42.440\n to influence the outcomes in some way\n\n3:11:42.440 --> 3:11:45.760\n that benefits your intelligence requirements, right?\n\n3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:48.080\n Of these three types of people,\n\n3:11:48.080 --> 3:11:52.480\n the least scrupulous and the most shady\n\n3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:54.400\n is your agent of influence.\n\n3:11:54.400 --> 3:11:55.520\n Because your agent of influence\n\n3:11:55.520 --> 3:11:57.120\n understands exactly what they're doing.\n\n3:11:57.120 --> 3:11:59.480\n They know they're working with one guy\n\n3:11:59.480 --> 3:12:02.000\n and they know they're using the influence\n\n3:12:02.000 --> 3:12:03.920\n to manipulate some other guy.\n\n3:12:04.920 --> 3:12:06.960\n When it comes to powerful people,\n\n3:12:06.960 --> 3:12:09.160\n especially wealthy, powerful people,\n\n3:12:10.560 --> 3:12:13.760\n the only thing that interests them is power.\n\n3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:16.040\n Money is not a challenge anymore.\n\n3:12:16.040 --> 3:12:19.120\n Prestige, notoriety, none of those things are a challenge.\n\n3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:21.000\n The rest of us, we're busy trying to make money.\n\n3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:22.720\n We're busy trying to build a reputation.\n\n3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:25.280\n We're busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat.\n\n3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:27.040\n At the highest levels, they're bored.\n\n3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:28.440\n They don't need any of that.\n\n3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:30.080\n The only thing that they care about\n\n3:12:30.080 --> 3:12:31.960\n is being able to wield power.\n\n3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:35.240\n So a character like Jeffrey Epstein\n\n3:12:35.240 --> 3:12:37.920\n is exactly the kind of character\n\n3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:41.240\n that the Chinese would want, the Russians would want,\n\n3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:43.960\n Mossad would want, the French would want.\n\n3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:47.640\n It's too easy because the man had access\n\n3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:52.160\n to a wide range of American influential people.\n\n3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:54.320\n For corporate espionage uses,\n\n3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:56.880\n for economic espionage uses,\n\n3:12:56.880 --> 3:12:59.400\n for national security espionage uses,\n\n3:12:59.400 --> 3:13:01.360\n it doesn't make any sense\n\n3:13:01.360 --> 3:13:03.600\n that a person like that wouldn't be targeted.\n\n3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:04.520\n It doesn't.\n\n3:13:04.520 --> 3:13:05.960\n So the question is.\n\n3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.440\n Who?\n\n3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:12.440\n Who, and whether, I think the really important distinction\n\n3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:18.120\n here is was this person, was Jeffrey Epstein created,\n\n3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:21.640\n or once he's achieved and built his network,\n\n3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:23.520\n was he then infiltrated?\n\n3:13:23.520 --> 3:13:26.800\n And that's a really sort of important difference.\n\n3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:29.480\n Like at which stage do you connect a person like that?\n\n3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:32.240\n You start to notice maybe they're effective\n\n3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:36.040\n at building a network, and then you start making,\n\n3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:39.040\n building a relationship to where at some point\n\n3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:41.040\n it's a job, they're working for you.\n\n3:13:41.040 --> 3:13:43.800\n Or do you literally create a person like that?\n\n3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:45.720\n Yeah, so intelligence organizations\n\n3:13:45.720 --> 3:13:47.120\n have different strategies here.\n\n3:13:47.120 --> 3:13:49.760\n In the United States, we never create.\n\n3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:53.320\n We don't have a budget cycle that allows us to create.\n\n3:13:53.320 --> 3:13:55.280\n I mean, the maximum budget cycle\n\n3:13:55.280 --> 3:13:57.120\n in the United States is five years.\n\n3:13:57.120 --> 3:14:00.480\n So even if we were to try to invest in some seed operation\n\n3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:03.080\n or create some character of influence,\n\n3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:06.080\n essentially every year you have to justify\n\n3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:07.680\n why you're spending budget.\n\n3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:10.080\n And that becomes very difficult in a democracy like ours.\n\n3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:13.760\n However, Russia and China are extremely adept\n\n3:14:13.760 --> 3:14:17.200\n at seed operations, longterm operations.\n\n3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:20.880\n They are willing to invest and develop\n\n3:14:20.880 --> 3:14:25.880\n and create an agent that serves their purposes.\n\n3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:30.400\n Now, to create someone from scratch like Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n3:14:31.400 --> 3:14:33.520\n the probabilities are extremely low.\n\n3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:34.480\n They would have had to start\n\n3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:36.720\n with like a thousand different targets\n\n3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:38.800\n and try to grow a thousand different,\n\n3:14:38.800 --> 3:14:41.200\n if you will, influencers, and then hope\n\n3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:42.120\n that one of them hits,\n\n3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:44.040\n kind of like a venture capital firm, right?\n\n3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:46.480\n Invest in many, hope that a few hits.\n\n3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:50.720\n More likely, they observed him at some point\n\n3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:52.760\n in his own natural rise.\n\n3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:54.960\n They identified his personal vulnerability,\n\n3:14:54.960 --> 3:14:57.040\n very classic espionage technique.\n\n3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:00.560\n And then they stepped in, introduced themselves mid career\n\n3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:03.560\n and said, hey, we know you have this thing that you like\n\n3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:06.440\n that isn't really frowned upon by your own people,\n\n3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:07.640\n but we don't frown upon it.\n\n3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:10.000\n And we can help you both succeed\n\n3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:14.360\n and have an endless supply of ladies along the way.\n\n3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:17.640\n I recently talked to Ryan Graves, who's a lieutenant.\n\n3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:20.920\n Ryan Graves, who's a fighter jet pilot,\n\n3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:22.960\n about many things.\n\n3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:26.120\n He also does work on autonomous weapon systems,\n\n3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:27.760\n drones, and that kind of thing,\n\n3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:29.480\n including quantum computing.\n\n3:15:29.480 --> 3:15:33.840\n But he also happens to be one of the very few pilots\n\n3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:35.680\n that were willing to go on record\n\n3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:37.880\n and talk about UFO sightings.\n\n3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:42.400\n Does the CIA and the federal government\n\n3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:44.640\n have interest in UFOs?\n\n3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:47.360\n In my experience at CIA, that is,\n\n3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:51.320\n an area that remains very compartmented.\n\n3:15:51.320 --> 3:15:54.320\n And that could be one of two reasons.\n\n3:15:54.320 --> 3:15:56.280\n It could be because there is significant interest\n\n3:15:56.280 --> 3:15:58.600\n and that's why it's so heavily compartmented.\n\n3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:02.440\n Or it could be because it's an area that's non,\n\n3:16:02.440 --> 3:16:03.600\n that's just not important.\n\n3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:04.920\n It's a distraction.\n\n3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:08.040\n So they compartment it so it doesn't distract\n\n3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:09.440\n from other operations.\n\n3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:15.400\n One of the areas that I've been quite interested in\n\n3:16:15.400 --> 3:16:17.360\n and where I've done a lot of research and I've done some work\n\n3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:19.520\n in the private intelligence and private investigation side\n\n3:16:19.520 --> 3:16:20.600\n is with UFOs.\n\n3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:25.120\n The place where UFOs really connect\n\n3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:26.920\n with the federal government is when it comes\n\n3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:30.760\n to aviation safety and predominance of power.\n\n3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:34.600\n So FAA and the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. military\n\n3:16:34.600 --> 3:16:36.520\n are very invested in knowing what's happening\n\n3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:38.520\n in the skies above the United States.\n\n3:16:38.520 --> 3:16:41.120\n And that's of primary interest to them.\n\n3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:45.000\n When they can rule out the direct threat to national security\n\n3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:47.880\n of UFOs, then they become less interested.\n\n3:16:47.880 --> 3:16:52.160\n That said, when you have unexplained aerial phenomenon\n\n3:16:52.160 --> 3:16:56.680\n that are unexplained, that can't directly be tied\n\n3:16:56.680 --> 3:17:01.200\n to anything that is known of the terrestrial world,\n\n3:17:02.240 --> 3:17:05.560\n then they're left without an answer to their question.\n\n3:17:05.560 --> 3:17:08.360\n They don't know if it's a threat or not a threat.\n\n3:17:08.360 --> 3:17:10.720\n But I think that's a very important question.\n\n3:17:10.720 --> 3:17:12.600\n But I think the scarier concern\n\n3:17:12.600 --> 3:17:13.840\n for the U.S. national government\n\n3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:15.320\n or for the U.S. federal government,\n\n3:17:15.320 --> 3:17:17.000\n the scarier concern that nobody talks about\n\n3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:20.360\n is what if the UFO isn't alien?\n\n3:17:20.360 --> 3:17:25.360\n What if it is actually a cutting edge war machine\n\n3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:29.320\n that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate?\n\n3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:34.240\n Or the other concern is that it's a system,\n\n3:17:34.240 --> 3:17:36.880\n it's a machine from a foreign power\n\n3:17:36.880 --> 3:17:38.760\n that's doing intelligence collection.\n\n3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:39.600\n Correct.\n\n3:17:39.600 --> 3:17:43.800\n Not just military purposes, it's actually collecting data.\n\n3:17:43.800 --> 3:17:46.240\n Well, they fall, a lot of times the federal government\n\n3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:47.200\n will see the two as the same.\n\n3:17:47.200 --> 3:17:50.200\n It's a hostile tool from a foreign government.\n\n3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:53.680\n So collection of information is a hostile act.\n\n3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:56.600\n Absolutely, that's why the Espionage Act exists.\n\n3:17:56.600 --> 3:17:58.160\n That's why it's a criminal offense\n\n3:17:58.160 --> 3:18:00.360\n if you're committing espionage in the United States\n\n3:18:00.360 --> 3:18:03.320\n as a U.S. citizen or a foreign citizen.\n\n3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:04.680\n So I guess they keep digging\n\n3:18:04.680 --> 3:18:07.000\n until they can confirm it's not a threat.\n\n3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:10.640\n But it just, and you're saying that there's not,\n\n3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:12.840\n from your understanding, much evidence that they're doing.\n\n3:18:12.840 --> 3:18:17.040\n So it could be because they're compartmentalized.\n\n3:18:17.040 --> 3:18:21.520\n But you're saying private intelligence institutions\n\n3:18:21.520 --> 3:18:24.540\n are trying to make progress on this.\n\n3:18:25.560 --> 3:18:29.600\n Yeah, it's really difficult to know the scale.\n\n3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:31.480\n Yeah, there's an economic interest\n\n3:18:31.480 --> 3:18:33.880\n in the private intelligence world.\n\n3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:36.000\n Because, for example, if you understand\n\n3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:40.000\n why certain aerial phenomenon are happening over a location,\n\n3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:43.360\n then you can use that to inform investors,\n\n3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:44.960\n whether to invest in that location\n\n3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:47.080\n or avoid investment in that location.\n\n3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:48.680\n But that's not a national security concern.\n\n3:18:48.680 --> 3:18:51.500\n So it doesn't matter to the federal government.\n\n3:18:52.600 --> 3:18:54.560\n Could these UFOs be aliens?\n\n3:18:54.560 --> 3:18:57.320\n Now I'm going into a territory of you as a human being\n\n3:18:57.320 --> 3:19:00.080\n wondering about all the alien civilizations\n\n3:19:00.080 --> 3:19:01.640\n that are out there.\n\n3:19:01.640 --> 3:19:03.980\n The humbling question.\n\n3:19:03.980 --> 3:19:05.560\n We are not alone.\n\n3:19:05.560 --> 3:19:07.040\n You think we're not alone.\n\n3:19:07.040 --> 3:19:10.360\n It's an improbability that we are alone.\n\n3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:15.120\n If by virtue of the fact that sentient human life exists,\n\n3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:17.440\n intelligent human life exists,\n\n3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:19.360\n all the probabilities that would have to be destroyed\n\n3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:22.860\n for that to be true simply speak over the galaxies\n\n3:19:22.860 --> 3:19:26.240\n that exist that there's no possible way we're alone.\n\n3:19:26.240 --> 3:19:27.800\n It's a mathematical equation.\n\n3:19:27.800 --> 3:19:30.320\n It's a one or a zero, right?\n\n3:19:30.320 --> 3:19:32.600\n And for me, it has to exist.\n\n3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:35.480\n It's impossible otherwise rationally for me to think\n\n3:19:35.480 --> 3:19:37.960\n that we are truly the only intelligent life form\n\n3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:39.360\n in all of the universe.\n\n3:19:40.320 --> 3:19:44.000\n But to think that an alien life form\n\n3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:49.000\n is anything like us at all is equally as inconceivable.\n\n3:19:49.840 --> 3:19:53.360\n To think that they're carbon based bipedal humanoid\n\n3:19:54.320 --> 3:19:57.120\n alien species that just happened to fly around\n\n3:19:57.120 --> 3:20:01.120\n in metal machines and visit alien planets\n\n3:20:01.120 --> 3:20:03.840\n in a way that they become observed\n\n3:20:03.840 --> 3:20:07.080\n is, it's just silly, it's the world of sci fi.\n\n3:20:07.080 --> 3:20:08.000\n Well, let me push.\n\n3:20:08.000 --> 3:20:09.880\n Every good scientist,\n\n3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:11.580\n because we always assume that they're superior\n\n3:20:11.580 --> 3:20:12.880\n to us in intelligence.\n\n3:20:12.880 --> 3:20:13.720\n Yes.\n\n3:20:13.720 --> 3:20:16.440\n When any scientist carries out an experiment,\n\n3:20:16.440 --> 3:20:19.520\n the whole objective of the experiment is to observe\n\n3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:23.400\n without being disclosed or being discovered.\n\n3:20:23.400 --> 3:20:26.320\n So why on earth would we think that the superior species\n\n3:20:26.320 --> 3:20:29.220\n makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again?\n\n3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:32.680\n So to push back on that idea,\n\n3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:35.680\n if we were to think about us humans trying to communicate\n\n3:20:35.680 --> 3:20:39.440\n with ants, first we observe for a while.\n\n3:20:39.440 --> 3:20:41.280\n There'll be a bunch of PhDs written,\n\n3:20:41.280 --> 3:20:45.120\n a bunch of people just sort of collecting data,\n\n3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:48.440\n taking notes, trying to understand about this thing\n\n3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:50.960\n that you detected that seems to be a living thing,\n\n3:20:50.960 --> 3:20:52.560\n which is a very difficult thing to define\n\n3:20:52.560 --> 3:20:55.200\n from an alien perspective or from our perspective\n\n3:20:55.200 --> 3:20:57.600\n if we find life on Mars or something like that.\n\n3:20:57.600 --> 3:20:59.720\n Okay, so you observe for a while.\n\n3:20:59.720 --> 3:21:02.320\n But then if you want to actually interact with it,\n\n3:21:02.320 --> 3:21:04.440\n how would you interact with the ants?\n\n3:21:04.440 --> 3:21:06.880\n If I were to interact with the ants,\n\n3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:10.620\n I would try to infiltrate.\n\n3:21:10.620 --> 3:21:15.080\n I would try to figure out what is the language\n\n3:21:15.080 --> 3:21:17.880\n they use to communicate with each other.\n\n3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:21.840\n I would try to operate at their physical scale,\n\n3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:24.620\n like in terms of the physics of their interaction,\n\n3:21:24.620 --> 3:21:28.520\n in terms of the information, methods, mediums\n\n3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:31.400\n of information exchange with pheromones or whatever,\n\n3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:33.040\n however the heck, ants.\n\n3:21:33.040 --> 3:21:36.000\n So I would try to mimic them in some way.\n\n3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:38.400\n So in that sense, it makes sense\n\n3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:43.400\n that the objects we would see, you mentioned bipedal.\n\n3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:46.800\n Yes, of course it's ridiculous that aliens\n\n3:21:46.800 --> 3:21:50.240\n would actually be very similar to us,\n\n3:21:50.240 --> 3:21:54.520\n but maybe they create forms in order to be like,\n\n3:21:54.520 --> 3:21:58.280\n here, the humans will understand it.\n\n3:21:58.280 --> 3:22:00.920\n And this needs to be sufficiently different from humans\n\n3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:02.840\n to know that there's something weird.\n\n3:22:02.840 --> 3:22:05.080\n I don't know, I think it's actually\n\n3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:07.360\n an incredibly difficult problem of figuring out\n\n3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:10.420\n how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you.\n\n3:22:11.920 --> 3:22:14.680\n People assume if you're smart,\n\n3:22:14.680 --> 3:22:16.840\n it's easier to talk to the dumb thing.\n\n3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:19.260\n But I think it's actually extremely difficult\n\n3:22:19.260 --> 3:22:23.740\n when the gap in intelligence is just orders of magnitude.\n\n3:22:23.740 --> 3:22:26.320\n And so of course you can observe,\n\n3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:30.040\n but once you notice the thing is sufficiently interesting,\n\n3:22:30.040 --> 3:22:32.160\n how do you communicate with that thing?\n\n3:22:32.160 --> 3:22:34.320\n So this is where, one of the things\n\n3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:38.720\n I always try to highlight is how conspiracies are born.\n\n3:22:38.720 --> 3:22:41.300\n Because many people don't understand how easy it is\n\n3:22:41.300 --> 3:22:44.360\n to fall into the conspiratorial cycle.\n\n3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:47.560\n So the first step to a conspiracy being born\n\n3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:52.360\n is to have a piece of evidence that is true.\n\n3:22:52.360 --> 3:22:55.360\n And then immediately following the true evidence\n\n3:22:55.360 --> 3:22:57.280\n is a gap in information.\n\n3:22:57.280 --> 3:23:00.720\n And then to fill in the gap of information,\n\n3:23:00.720 --> 3:23:05.720\n people create an idea and then the next logical outcome\n\n3:23:05.920 --> 3:23:08.080\n is based on the idea that they just created,\n\n3:23:08.080 --> 3:23:10.260\n which is an idea that's based on something\n\n3:23:10.260 --> 3:23:12.480\n that was imagined in the first place.\n\n3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:15.520\n So the idea, the factual thing is now two steps away\n\n3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:17.280\n and then three steps away, four steps away\n\n3:23:17.280 --> 3:23:18.120\n as the things go on.\n\n3:23:18.120 --> 3:23:20.340\n And then all of a sudden you have this kernel of truth\n\n3:23:20.340 --> 3:23:23.040\n that turned into this wild conspiracy.\n\n3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:26.100\n So in our example, you talked about humans\n\n3:23:26.100 --> 3:23:27.360\n trying to communicate with ants.\n\n3:23:27.360 --> 3:23:28.880\n Ants are not intelligent.\n\n3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:30.840\n There's no, ants are not intelligent species.\n\n3:23:30.840 --> 3:23:33.860\n They're a drone species that's somehow commanded\n\n3:23:33.860 --> 3:23:36.080\n through whatever technology, whatever.\n\n3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:37.960\n Spoken like a typical human, but yes.\n\n3:23:37.960 --> 3:23:40.160\n Whatever biological thing is in the queen, right?\n\n3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:42.000\n But they're not, it's not a fair equivalent.\n\n3:23:42.000 --> 3:23:43.160\n But let's look at gorillas\n\n3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:45.280\n or let's look at something in the monkey family, right?\n\n3:23:45.280 --> 3:23:48.500\n Where largely we agree that there is some sort\n\n3:23:48.500 --> 3:23:50.080\n of intelligence there or dolphins,\n\n3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:52.220\n some sort of intelligence, right?\n\n3:23:52.220 --> 3:23:57.220\n It is a human thing, a human thing to want to observe\n\n3:23:59.180 --> 3:24:02.300\n and then communicate and integrate.\n\n3:24:02.300 --> 3:24:06.660\n That's a human thing, not an intelligent life thing.\n\n3:24:06.660 --> 3:24:09.080\n So for us to even think that a foreign\n\n3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:12.260\n and intelligent alien species would want to engage\n\n3:24:12.260 --> 3:24:16.940\n and communicate at all is an extremely human assumption.\n\n3:24:16.940 --> 3:24:18.220\n And then from that assumption,\n\n3:24:18.220 --> 3:24:20.220\n then we started going into all the other things you said.\n\n3:24:20.220 --> 3:24:21.780\n If they wanted to communicate,\n\n3:24:21.780 --> 3:24:23.040\n wouldn't they want to mimic?\n\n3:24:23.040 --> 3:24:24.140\n If they wanted to mimic,\n\n3:24:24.140 --> 3:24:26.040\n wouldn't they create devices like ours?\n\n3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:29.320\n So now we're three steps removed from the true fact\n\n3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:32.400\n of there's something unexplainable in the skies.\n\n3:24:34.460 --> 3:24:37.780\n Yeah, so the fact is there's something unexplainable\n\n3:24:37.780 --> 3:24:40.380\n in the skies and then we're filling in the gaps\n\n3:24:40.380 --> 3:24:43.300\n with all our basic human biases and assumptions.\n\n3:24:43.300 --> 3:24:44.140\n Exactly.\n\n3:24:44.140 --> 3:24:45.060\n But the thing is.\n\n3:24:45.060 --> 3:24:47.620\n Now we're getting right back to Project Northwood.\n\n3:24:47.620 --> 3:24:48.800\n We need some plan.\n\n3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:50.440\n I don't care how crazy the idea is, guys.\n\n3:24:50.440 --> 3:24:51.540\n Give me some plan.\n\n3:24:51.540 --> 3:24:53.380\n So that's where we come up with.\n\n3:24:53.380 --> 3:24:55.300\n Maybe it's an alien species trying to communicate\n\n3:24:55.300 --> 3:24:57.940\n or maybe it's an alien, a hostile threat\n\n3:24:57.940 --> 3:25:00.980\n that's trying to take over the world or who knows what.\n\n3:25:00.980 --> 3:25:01.820\n Maybe it's.\n\n3:25:01.820 --> 3:25:06.820\n But you have to somehow construct hypotheses\n\n3:25:07.140 --> 3:25:10.100\n and theories for anomalies.\n\n3:25:10.100 --> 3:25:15.100\n And then from that, amidst giant pile of the ridiculous,\n\n3:25:16.580 --> 3:25:21.100\n emerges perhaps a deeper truth over a period of decades.\n\n3:25:21.100 --> 3:25:24.440\n And at first, that truth is ridiculed\n\n3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:29.260\n and then it's accepted, that whole process.\n\n3:25:29.260 --> 3:25:30.780\n The Earth revolving around the sun?\n\n3:25:30.780 --> 3:25:32.900\n Yeah, the Earth revolving around the sun.\n\n3:25:32.900 --> 3:25:37.380\n But to me, it's interesting because it asks us\n\n3:25:37.380 --> 3:25:41.940\n looking out there with SETI, just looking for alien life,\n\n3:25:41.940 --> 3:25:45.580\n is forcing us to really ask questions about ourselves,\n\n3:25:45.580 --> 3:25:48.380\n about what is life, how special.\n\n3:25:48.380 --> 3:25:49.980\n First of all, what is intelligence?\n\n3:25:49.980 --> 3:25:52.460\n How special is intelligence in the cosmos?\n\n3:25:52.460 --> 3:25:55.820\n And I think it's inspiring and challenging\n\n3:25:55.820 --> 3:25:57.420\n to us as human beings,\n\n3:25:57.420 --> 3:26:00.320\n both on a scientific and engineering level,\n\n3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:01.860\n but also on a philosophical level.\n\n3:26:01.860 --> 3:26:04.460\n I mean, all of those questions that are laid before us\n\n3:26:04.460 --> 3:26:06.540\n when you start to think about alien life.\n\n3:26:06.540 --> 3:26:09.020\n So you interviewed Joe Rogan recently.\n\n3:26:09.020 --> 3:26:09.860\n Yeah.\n\n3:26:09.860 --> 3:26:12.380\n And he said something that I thought was really,\n\n3:26:12.380 --> 3:26:14.780\n really brilliant during the podcast interview.\n\n3:26:14.780 --> 3:26:15.620\n He said that you.\n\n3:26:15.620 --> 3:26:16.940\n He's gonna love hearing that.\n\n3:26:16.940 --> 3:26:18.820\n But go ahead, sorry.\n\n3:26:18.820 --> 3:26:21.980\n But he said that he realized at some point\n\n3:26:22.940 --> 3:26:25.560\n that the turn in his opinion about UFOs happened\n\n3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:29.280\n when he realized how desperately he wanted it to be true.\n\n3:26:30.420 --> 3:26:33.760\n This is the human condition.\n\n3:26:33.760 --> 3:26:35.860\n We are pink matter works the same way\n\n3:26:35.860 --> 3:26:36.980\n as everybody's pink matter.\n\n3:26:36.980 --> 3:26:38.540\n And one of the ways that our pink matter works\n\n3:26:38.540 --> 3:26:41.540\n is with this thing, with what's known as a cognitive bias.\n\n3:26:41.540 --> 3:26:42.940\n It's a mental shortcut.\n\n3:26:42.940 --> 3:26:45.180\n Essentially, your brain doesn't want to process\n\n3:26:45.180 --> 3:26:46.660\n through facts over and over again.\n\n3:26:46.660 --> 3:26:48.980\n Instead, it wants to assume certain facts are in place\n\n3:26:48.980 --> 3:26:50.280\n and just jump right to the conclusion.\n\n3:26:50.280 --> 3:26:52.980\n It saves energy, it saves megabytes.\n\n3:26:52.980 --> 3:26:56.300\n So what Joe or Joe Rogan,\n\n3:26:56.300 --> 3:26:57.820\n I feel weird calling him Joe, I don't know him,\n\n3:26:57.820 --> 3:26:59.660\n but what Joe identified on his own.\n\n3:26:59.660 --> 3:27:00.580\n Mr. Rogan.\n\n3:27:00.580 --> 3:27:03.340\n What Mr. Rogan identified on his own.\n\n3:27:03.340 --> 3:27:04.180\n Yeah.\n\n3:27:04.180 --> 3:27:06.900\n Was his own cognitive loop.\n\n3:27:06.900 --> 3:27:10.340\n And then he immediately grew suspicious of that loop.\n\n3:27:10.340 --> 3:27:11.880\n That is a super powerful tool.\n\n3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:13.340\n That is something that most people\n\n3:27:13.340 --> 3:27:15.620\n never become self actualized enough to realize\n\n3:27:15.620 --> 3:27:17.260\n that they have a cognitive loop,\n\n3:27:17.260 --> 3:27:20.160\n let alone questioning their own cognitive loop.\n\n3:27:20.160 --> 3:27:23.460\n So that was, when it came to this topic specifically,\n\n3:27:23.460 --> 3:27:25.900\n that was just something that I thought was really powerful\n\n3:27:25.900 --> 3:27:30.900\n because you learn to not trust your own mind.\n\n3:27:30.900 --> 3:27:34.620\n Just for the record, after he drinks one whiskey,\n\n3:27:34.620 --> 3:27:36.420\n all that goes out.\n\n3:27:36.420 --> 3:27:40.380\n I think that was just in that moment in time, like, you know.\n\n3:27:40.380 --> 3:27:41.740\n A moment of brilliance.\n\n3:27:41.740 --> 3:27:45.900\n A moment of brilliance is, I think he still is, you know,\n\n3:27:48.420 --> 3:27:50.860\n he's definitely, one of the things that inspires me about Joe\n\n3:27:50.860 --> 3:27:53.420\n is how open minded he is, how curious he is.\n\n3:27:53.420 --> 3:27:55.860\n He refuses to let sort of the conformity\n\n3:27:55.860 --> 3:27:58.900\n and the conventions of any one community,\n\n3:27:58.900 --> 3:28:00.620\n including the scientific community,\n\n3:28:00.620 --> 3:28:04.220\n be a kind of thing that limits his curiosity,\n\n3:28:04.220 --> 3:28:08.760\n of asking what if, like the whole, it's entirely possible.\n\n3:28:08.760 --> 3:28:10.180\n I think that's a beautiful thing.\n\n3:28:10.180 --> 3:28:13.700\n And it actually represents what the best of science is,\n\n3:28:13.700 --> 3:28:15.540\n that childlike curiosity.\n\n3:28:15.540 --> 3:28:18.580\n But, so it's good to sort of balance those two things,\n\n3:28:18.580 --> 3:28:21.220\n but then you have to wake up to it, like,\n\n3:28:21.220 --> 3:28:24.420\n is this, is there a chance this is true,\n\n3:28:24.420 --> 3:28:27.100\n or do I just really want it to be true?\n\n3:28:27.100 --> 3:28:27.940\n And that.\n\n3:28:27.940 --> 3:28:29.820\n Like that hot girl that talks to you overseas?\n\n3:28:29.820 --> 3:28:30.700\n Yeah.\n\n3:28:30.700 --> 3:28:31.540\n Yeah.\n\n3:28:32.980 --> 3:28:34.060\n For a brief moment.\n\n3:28:35.020 --> 3:28:37.940\n There's actually a deeper explanation for it\n\n3:28:37.940 --> 3:28:41.020\n that I'll tell you off the mic that perhaps\n\n3:28:41.020 --> 3:28:42.940\n a lot of people can kind of figure out.\n\n3:28:42.940 --> 3:28:43.780\n Anyway.\n\n3:28:43.780 --> 3:28:44.860\n Just to take it one step further,\n\n3:28:44.860 --> 3:28:45.780\n cause I love this stuff.\n\n3:28:45.780 --> 3:28:48.860\n Personally, I love pink matter stuff.\n\n3:28:48.860 --> 3:28:50.060\n In your interview with Jack Barsky,\n\n3:28:50.060 --> 3:28:52.260\n Jack's a good friend of mine, a good dude.\n\n3:28:52.260 --> 3:28:53.100\n An incredible person.\n\n3:28:53.100 --> 3:28:53.940\n Yeah.\n\n3:28:53.940 --> 3:28:55.780\n In your conversation with Jack Barsky,\n\n3:28:55.780 --> 3:28:58.500\n you guys, he started talking to you about\n\n3:28:58.500 --> 3:29:02.700\n how his recruiters were feeding back to him his own beliefs,\n\n3:29:02.700 --> 3:29:05.660\n his own opinions about himself, how smart he was,\n\n3:29:05.660 --> 3:29:08.340\n how good he was, how uniquely qualified he was.\n\n3:29:08.340 --> 3:29:10.420\n That's all pink matter manipulation.\n\n3:29:10.420 --> 3:29:12.380\n Feeding right back to the person\n\n3:29:12.380 --> 3:29:14.100\n what they already think of themselves\n\n3:29:14.100 --> 3:29:17.660\n is a way to get them to invest and trust you faster\n\n3:29:17.660 --> 3:29:21.180\n because obviously you value them for all the right reasons\n\n3:29:21.180 --> 3:29:22.980\n because that's how they see themselves.\n\n3:29:22.980 --> 3:29:27.980\n So that loop that the KGB was using with Jack,\n\n3:29:28.900 --> 3:29:31.100\n Jack did not wake up to that loop at the time.\n\n3:29:31.100 --> 3:29:32.980\n He woke up to it later.\n\n3:29:32.980 --> 3:29:35.180\n So it happens to all of us.\n\n3:29:35.180 --> 3:29:37.220\n We're all in a loop.\n\n3:29:37.220 --> 3:29:39.620\n It's just whether it's about oat milk\n\n3:29:39.620 --> 3:29:41.140\n or whether it's about aliens\n\n3:29:41.140 --> 3:29:44.740\n or whether it's about the Democrats trying to take your guns,\n\n3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:47.020\n whatever it is, everybody's in a loop\n\n3:29:47.020 --> 3:29:49.060\n and we've got to wake up to ask ourselves,\n\n3:29:49.060 --> 3:29:51.500\n just like you said, is it true\n\n3:29:51.500 --> 3:29:53.820\n or do we just really want it to be true?\n\n3:29:53.820 --> 3:29:55.700\n And until you ask yourself that question,\n\n3:29:55.700 --> 3:29:58.220\n you're just one of the masses trapped in the loop.\n\n3:29:58.220 --> 3:30:03.220\n Yeah, that's the really, the Nietzsche gaze into the abyss.\n\n3:30:03.540 --> 3:30:05.020\n It's a dangerous thing.\n\n3:30:05.020 --> 3:30:08.580\n That's the path to insanity is to ask that question.\n\n3:30:08.580 --> 3:30:10.980\n You want to be doing it carefully,\n\n3:30:10.980 --> 3:30:14.260\n but it's also the place where you can truly discover\n\n3:30:14.260 --> 3:30:15.940\n something fundamental about this world\n\n3:30:15.940 --> 3:30:17.260\n that people don't understand\n\n3:30:17.260 --> 3:30:21.820\n and then that and lay the groundwork for progress,\n\n3:30:21.820 --> 3:30:24.980\n scientific, cultural, all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:30:24.980 --> 3:30:25.820\n Absolutely.\n\n3:30:27.340 --> 3:30:28.860\n What is one spy trick?\n\n3:30:28.860 --> 3:30:31.220\n This is from a Reddit that I really enjoy.\n\n3:30:31.220 --> 3:30:36.220\n What's one spy trick and you're full of a million spy tricks.\n\n3:30:36.900 --> 3:30:37.820\n People should follow you.\n\n3:30:37.820 --> 3:30:39.220\n You did an amazing podcast.\n\n3:30:39.220 --> 3:30:40.460\n You're just an amazing person.\n\n3:30:40.460 --> 3:30:42.020\n Thank you.\n\n3:30:42.020 --> 3:30:45.060\n What is the one spy trick you would teach everyone\n\n3:30:45.060 --> 3:30:47.980\n that they can use to improve their life instantly?\n\n3:30:47.980 --> 3:30:50.820\n Now you already mentioned quite a few,\n\n3:30:50.820 --> 3:30:54.140\n but what else could jump to mind?\n\n3:30:54.140 --> 3:30:56.620\n My go to answer for this has not really changed much\n\n3:30:56.620 --> 3:30:57.660\n over the last few years.\n\n3:30:57.660 --> 3:31:00.020\n So the first, the most important spy trick\n\n3:31:00.020 --> 3:31:01.700\n to change everything immediately\n\n3:31:02.780 --> 3:31:06.220\n is something called perception versus perspective.\n\n3:31:06.220 --> 3:31:09.220\n We all look at the world through our own perception.\n\n3:31:10.300 --> 3:31:11.540\n My dad used to tell me,\n\n3:31:11.540 --> 3:31:13.740\n my stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality.\n\n3:31:13.740 --> 3:31:17.460\n And I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old.\n\n3:31:17.460 --> 3:31:19.300\n I told you so dad, you're still wrong.\n\n3:31:20.580 --> 3:31:22.660\n But perception is your interpretation\n\n3:31:22.660 --> 3:31:25.460\n of the world around you, but it's unique only to you.\n\n3:31:26.340 --> 3:31:28.860\n There's no advantage in your perception.\n\n3:31:28.860 --> 3:31:30.220\n That's why so many people find themselves\n\n3:31:30.220 --> 3:31:31.540\n arguing all the time,\n\n3:31:31.540 --> 3:31:35.500\n trying to convince other people of their own perception.\n\n3:31:35.500 --> 3:31:37.820\n The way that you win any argument,\n\n3:31:37.820 --> 3:31:39.820\n the way that you get ahead in your career,\n\n3:31:39.820 --> 3:31:44.820\n the way that you outsell or out race anybody\n\n3:31:45.100 --> 3:31:47.500\n is when you move off of perception\n\n3:31:47.500 --> 3:31:49.660\n and move into perspective.\n\n3:31:49.660 --> 3:31:52.340\n Perspective is the act or the art\n\n3:31:52.340 --> 3:31:56.380\n of observing the world from outside of yourself,\n\n3:31:56.380 --> 3:31:59.420\n whether that's outside of yourself as like an entity,\n\n3:31:59.420 --> 3:32:02.420\n just observing in a third from a different point of view,\n\n3:32:02.420 --> 3:32:05.140\n or even more powerful, you sit in the shoes,\n\n3:32:05.140 --> 3:32:07.460\n you sit in the seat of the person opposite you.\n\n3:32:07.460 --> 3:32:10.180\n And you think to yourself, what is their life like?\n\n3:32:10.180 --> 3:32:11.620\n What do they feel right now?\n\n3:32:13.100 --> 3:32:13.940\n Are they comfortable?\n\n3:32:13.940 --> 3:32:14.780\n Are they uncomfortable?\n\n3:32:14.780 --> 3:32:15.620\n Are they afraid?\n\n3:32:15.620 --> 3:32:16.460\n Are they scared?\n\n3:32:16.460 --> 3:32:18.700\n What's the stressor that they woke up to this morning?\n\n3:32:18.700 --> 3:32:20.140\n What's the stressor that they're gonna go to sleep\n\n3:32:20.140 --> 3:32:21.660\n with tonight?\n\n3:32:21.660 --> 3:32:24.700\n When you shift places and get out of your own perception\n\n3:32:24.700 --> 3:32:27.260\n and into someone else's perspective,\n\n3:32:27.260 --> 3:32:29.220\n now you're thinking like them,\n\n3:32:29.220 --> 3:32:31.620\n which is giving you an informational advantage.\n\n3:32:31.620 --> 3:32:33.300\n But you know what they're all doing?\n\n3:32:33.300 --> 3:32:36.940\n Everyone else out there is trapped in their own perception,\n\n3:32:36.940 --> 3:32:39.340\n not thinking about a different perspective.\n\n3:32:39.340 --> 3:32:42.540\n So immediately you have superior information,\n\n3:32:42.540 --> 3:32:44.060\n superior positioning,\n\n3:32:44.060 --> 3:32:46.220\n you have an advantage that they don't have.\n\n3:32:46.220 --> 3:32:48.780\n And if you do that to your boss,\n\n3:32:48.780 --> 3:32:50.100\n it's gonna change your career.\n\n3:32:50.100 --> 3:32:51.420\n If you do that to your spouse,\n\n3:32:51.420 --> 3:32:52.540\n it's gonna change your marriage.\n\n3:32:52.540 --> 3:32:53.980\n If you do that to your kids,\n\n3:32:53.980 --> 3:32:55.780\n it's gonna change your family legacy\n\n3:32:55.780 --> 3:32:58.100\n because nobody else out there is doing it.\n\n3:32:58.100 --> 3:33:01.940\n It's so interesting how difficult empathy is for people\n\n3:33:01.940 --> 3:33:03.780\n and how powerful it is,\n\n3:33:03.780 --> 3:33:05.700\n especially for, like you said,\n\n3:33:05.700 --> 3:33:07.300\n with spouse, like intimacy.\n\n3:33:07.300 --> 3:33:08.140\n Yeah.\n\n3:33:08.140 --> 3:33:10.060\n Like stepping outside of yourself\n\n3:33:10.060 --> 3:33:12.660\n and really putting yourself in the shoes of the other person\n\n3:33:12.660 --> 3:33:14.300\n considering how they see the world.\n\n3:33:14.300 --> 3:33:17.820\n And that's, I really enjoy that\n\n3:33:17.820 --> 3:33:21.940\n because how does that exactly lead to connection?\n\n3:33:21.940 --> 3:33:26.620\n I think when you start to understand\n\n3:33:26.620 --> 3:33:30.020\n the way the other person sees the world,\n\n3:33:30.020 --> 3:33:32.260\n you start to enjoy the world through their eyes\n\n3:33:32.260 --> 3:33:34.260\n and you start to be able to share,\n\n3:33:34.260 --> 3:33:35.700\n in terms of intimacy,\n\n3:33:35.700 --> 3:33:39.100\n share the beauty that they see together\n\n3:33:39.100 --> 3:33:41.060\n because you understand their perspective.\n\n3:33:41.060 --> 3:33:43.740\n And somehow you converge as well.\n\n3:33:43.740 --> 3:33:46.100\n Of course, that allows you to gather information better\n\n3:33:46.100 --> 3:33:47.340\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:33:47.340 --> 3:33:50.420\n And that allows you to work together better,\n\n3:33:50.420 --> 3:33:53.340\n to share in all different kinds of ways.\n\n3:33:53.340 --> 3:33:55.780\n But for intimacy, that's a really powerful thing.\n\n3:33:55.780 --> 3:33:59.060\n And also for, actually,\n\n3:33:59.060 --> 3:34:00.940\n like people you really disagree with\n\n3:34:00.940 --> 3:34:03.180\n or people on the internet you disagree with and so on,\n\n3:34:03.180 --> 3:34:07.420\n I find empathy is such a powerful way\n\n3:34:07.420 --> 3:34:09.740\n to resolve any tensions there.\n\n3:34:09.740 --> 3:34:12.500\n Even like people like trolls or all that kind of stuff,\n\n3:34:12.500 --> 3:34:14.020\n I don't deride them.\n\n3:34:14.020 --> 3:34:15.980\n I just kind of put myself in their shoes\n\n3:34:15.980 --> 3:34:20.980\n and it becomes like an enjoyable comradery with that person.\n\n3:34:21.740 --> 3:34:23.180\n So I wanna draw a pretty hard line\n\n3:34:23.180 --> 3:34:26.660\n between perspective and empathy.\n\n3:34:26.660 --> 3:34:30.420\n Because empathy is, frankly, an overused term\n\n3:34:32.140 --> 3:34:33.740\n by people who don't really know\n\n3:34:33.740 --> 3:34:34.980\n what they're saying sometimes.\n\n3:34:34.980 --> 3:34:35.940\n I think you know what you're saying,\n\n3:34:35.940 --> 3:34:37.380\n but the vast majority of people listening.\n\n3:34:37.380 --> 3:34:39.300\n I would argue that, but that's fine.\n\n3:34:39.300 --> 3:34:40.540\n As soon as you say empathy,\n\n3:34:40.540 --> 3:34:41.380\n they're gonna just be like,\n\n3:34:41.380 --> 3:34:44.460\n oh, yeah, I've heard this a thousand times.\n\n3:34:44.460 --> 3:34:47.820\n Empathy is about feeling what other people feel.\n\n3:34:49.940 --> 3:34:50.780\n Or understanding.\n\n3:34:50.780 --> 3:34:51.700\n It's more about feeling, would you say?\n\n3:34:51.700 --> 3:34:53.060\n Yeah, it's about feelings.\n\n3:34:53.060 --> 3:34:54.860\n It's about understanding someone else's feelings.\n\n3:34:54.860 --> 3:34:58.060\n Feeling, it's not the same as sympathy\n\n3:34:58.060 --> 3:34:59.300\n where you feel their feelings.\n\n3:34:59.300 --> 3:35:01.860\n Empathy is about recognizing that they have feelings\n\n3:35:01.860 --> 3:35:04.380\n and recognizing that their feelings are valid.\n\n3:35:04.380 --> 3:35:07.340\n Perspective is more than just feelings.\n\n3:35:07.340 --> 3:35:09.820\n It's about the brain.\n\n3:35:09.820 --> 3:35:12.540\n It's about the pink matter on the left side\n\n3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:14.540\n and the right side of the brain.\n\n3:35:14.540 --> 3:35:16.460\n Yes, I care about feelings,\n\n3:35:16.460 --> 3:35:18.780\n and this goes directly to your point about connection.\n\n3:35:18.780 --> 3:35:20.260\n Yes, I care about feelings,\n\n3:35:20.260 --> 3:35:22.700\n but I also care about objectives.\n\n3:35:22.700 --> 3:35:25.700\n What is your life, what is your aspirational goal?\n\n3:35:25.700 --> 3:35:27.460\n What was it like to grow up as you?\n\n3:35:27.460 --> 3:35:29.020\n What was it like to experience this\n\n3:35:29.020 --> 3:35:30.820\n and how did this shape your opinion on that?\n\n3:35:30.820 --> 3:35:35.700\n And what is it that you're going to do next?\n\n3:35:35.700 --> 3:35:38.820\n More than just feelings, actual tactical actions.\n\n3:35:38.820 --> 3:35:41.100\n And that becomes extremely valuable\n\n3:35:41.100 --> 3:35:42.700\n in the operational world\n\n3:35:42.700 --> 3:35:45.060\n because if you can get into someone's head,\n\n3:35:45.060 --> 3:35:47.700\n left brain and right brain, feelings and logic,\n\n3:35:47.700 --> 3:35:48.700\n you can start anticipating\n\n3:35:48.700 --> 3:35:50.180\n what actions they're gonna take next.\n\n3:35:50.180 --> 3:35:52.580\n You can direct the actions that they're going to take next\n\n3:35:52.580 --> 3:35:54.180\n because you're basically telling them the story\n\n3:35:54.180 --> 3:35:55.980\n that's in their own head.\n\n3:35:55.980 --> 3:35:58.700\n When it comes to relationships and personal connection,\n\n3:35:58.700 --> 3:36:00.020\n we talked about it earlier,\n\n3:36:00.020 --> 3:36:05.020\n the thing that people want the most is community.\n\n3:36:05.620 --> 3:36:08.140\n They want someone else who understands them.\n\n3:36:08.140 --> 3:36:09.860\n They want to be with people.\n\n3:36:09.860 --> 3:36:11.780\n They don't want to be alone.\n\n3:36:11.780 --> 3:36:15.780\n The more you practice perspective, empathy or no empathy,\n\n3:36:15.780 --> 3:36:19.220\n the more you just validate that a person is there.\n\n3:36:19.220 --> 3:36:22.380\n I am in this time and space with you in this moment.\n\n3:36:22.380 --> 3:36:27.380\n Feelings aside, that is powerful.\n\n3:36:27.460 --> 3:36:29.180\n That is intimate.\n\n3:36:29.180 --> 3:36:31.020\n And whether you're talking about lovers\n\n3:36:31.020 --> 3:36:32.900\n or whether you're talking about a business exchange\n\n3:36:32.900 --> 3:36:35.900\n or whether you're talking about collaborators in a crime,\n\n3:36:35.900 --> 3:36:39.220\n I'm here with you ride or die, let's do it.\n\n3:36:39.220 --> 3:36:41.060\n That's powerful.\n\n3:36:41.060 --> 3:36:45.580\n How much of what you've learned in your role at the CIA\n\n3:36:46.460 --> 3:36:48.620\n transfer over to relationships,\n\n3:36:48.620 --> 3:36:51.420\n the business relationship to other aspects of life?\n\n3:36:51.420 --> 3:36:53.940\n This is something you work closely with powerful people\n\n3:36:53.940 --> 3:36:55.180\n to help them out.\n\n3:36:55.180 --> 3:36:57.940\n What have you learned about the commonalities,\n\n3:36:57.940 --> 3:36:59.940\n about the problems that people face?\n\n3:36:59.940 --> 3:37:04.940\n Man, I would say about a solid 95% of what I learned\n\n3:37:05.460 --> 3:37:07.540\n at CIA carries over to the civilian world.\n\n3:37:07.540 --> 3:37:10.460\n That 5% that doesn't is,\n\n3:37:10.460 --> 3:37:13.060\n it would carry over in a disaster, right?\n\n3:37:13.060 --> 3:37:16.180\n There's knowing how to shoot on target\n\n3:37:16.180 --> 3:37:20.780\n with my non dominant hand really only has one purpose.\n\n3:37:20.780 --> 3:37:23.220\n It's not gonna happen day to day, right?\n\n3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:25.540\n Knowing how to do a dead drop that isn't discoverable\n\n3:37:25.540 --> 3:37:28.540\n by the local police force isn't gonna be useful right now,\n\n3:37:28.540 --> 3:37:30.620\n but it could be useful in disaster.\n\n3:37:30.620 --> 3:37:32.780\n But the 95% of stuff that's useful,\n\n3:37:32.780 --> 3:37:34.540\n it's all tied to the human condition.\n\n3:37:34.540 --> 3:37:38.340\n It's all tied to being able to\n\n3:37:39.620 --> 3:37:41.020\n understand what someone's thinking,\n\n3:37:41.020 --> 3:37:43.020\n understand what someone's feeling,\n\n3:37:43.020 --> 3:37:45.500\n direct their thoughts, direct their emotions,\n\n3:37:45.500 --> 3:37:47.980\n direct their thought process, win their attention,\n\n3:37:47.980 --> 3:37:51.060\n win their loyalty, win influence with them,\n\n3:37:51.060 --> 3:37:54.860\n grow your network, grow your own circle of influence.\n\n3:37:54.860 --> 3:37:58.460\n I mean, all of that is immensely, immensely valuable.\n\n3:37:59.500 --> 3:38:00.860\n As an example, the disguise,\n\n3:38:00.860 --> 3:38:03.260\n the disguise thing that we talked about earlier,\n\n3:38:03.260 --> 3:38:06.580\n disguise in and of itself has mixed utility.\n\n3:38:06.580 --> 3:38:08.020\n If you're Brad Pitt and you don't want anybody\n\n3:38:08.020 --> 3:38:09.860\n to know you're Brad Pitt, you put on a level one disguise\n\n3:38:09.860 --> 3:38:10.700\n and that's great.\n\n3:38:10.700 --> 3:38:12.340\n Or maybe you call me and I walk you through\n\n3:38:12.340 --> 3:38:14.380\n a level two disguise so that you can go to Aruba\n\n3:38:14.380 --> 3:38:16.260\n and nobody's gonna know you're in Aruba, right?\n\n3:38:16.260 --> 3:38:17.100\n Whatever it is.\n\n3:38:18.780 --> 3:38:20.980\n But even there with the 5%\n\n3:38:20.980 --> 3:38:22.860\n that doesn't apply to everyday life,\n\n3:38:22.860 --> 3:38:24.780\n there's still elements that do.\n\n3:38:24.780 --> 3:38:28.780\n For example, when a person looks at a human being's face,\n\n3:38:28.780 --> 3:38:32.260\n the first place they look is the same part of the face\n\n3:38:32.260 --> 3:38:34.180\n as if they were reading a piece of paper.\n\n3:38:34.180 --> 3:38:36.900\n So in English, we start from the top left\n\n3:38:36.900 --> 3:38:38.740\n and we read left to right, top to bottom.\n\n3:38:38.740 --> 3:38:40.860\n So when an English speaking person\n\n3:38:40.860 --> 3:38:42.260\n interacts with another person,\n\n3:38:42.260 --> 3:38:45.500\n the first thing they look at isn't their eyes.\n\n3:38:45.500 --> 3:38:49.220\n It's the upper left from their point of view,\n\n3:38:49.220 --> 3:38:52.060\n corner of their face, right?\n\n3:38:52.060 --> 3:38:54.780\n They look there and the information they get\n\n3:38:54.780 --> 3:38:58.300\n is hair color, hair pattern, skin color, right?\n\n3:38:58.300 --> 3:38:59.140\n That's it.\n\n3:38:59.140 --> 3:39:01.020\n Before they know anything else about the face.\n\n3:39:01.020 --> 3:39:02.740\n This is one of the reasons why somebody can look at you\n\n3:39:02.740 --> 3:39:05.020\n and then you ask them, what color are my eyes?\n\n3:39:05.020 --> 3:39:06.380\n I don't really remember.\n\n3:39:06.380 --> 3:39:07.820\n Because the way they read the face,\n\n3:39:07.820 --> 3:39:10.260\n they read it from left to right, top to bottom.\n\n3:39:10.260 --> 3:39:11.580\n So they're paying a lot of attention\n\n3:39:11.580 --> 3:39:12.940\n to the first few things they see\n\n3:39:12.940 --> 3:39:14.140\n and then they're paying less attention\n\n3:39:14.140 --> 3:39:14.980\n as they go down the face.\n\n3:39:14.980 --> 3:39:17.620\n The same scrolling behavior that you see\n\n3:39:17.620 --> 3:39:18.940\n on the internet, right?\n\n3:39:18.940 --> 3:39:21.420\n So when you understand that through the lens of disguise,\n\n3:39:21.420 --> 3:39:23.260\n it allows you to make a very powerful disguise.\n\n3:39:23.260 --> 3:39:24.900\n The most important part of your disguise\n\n3:39:24.900 --> 3:39:27.420\n is here if you're English speaking, right?\n\n3:39:27.420 --> 3:39:29.380\n Here if you're speaking some foreign languages\n\n3:39:29.380 --> 3:39:31.180\n that read right to left, right?\n\n3:39:31.180 --> 3:39:32.500\n If you're, if it's Chinese,\n\n3:39:32.500 --> 3:39:34.180\n you know that they're gonna look from here down\n\n3:39:34.180 --> 3:39:35.860\n because they read left down.\n\n3:39:35.860 --> 3:39:36.700\n So.\n\n3:39:36.700 --> 3:39:37.540\n So interesting.\n\n3:39:37.540 --> 3:39:39.140\n So yeah, knowing that really helps you\n\n3:39:39.140 --> 3:39:40.460\n sort of configure the things\n\n3:39:40.460 --> 3:39:41.740\n in terms of physical appearance.\n\n3:39:41.740 --> 3:39:42.580\n That's interesting.\n\n3:39:42.580 --> 3:39:43.420\n Correct, correct.\n\n3:39:43.420 --> 3:39:45.300\n So when it comes to how to make a disguise,\n\n3:39:45.300 --> 3:39:47.740\n not so useful to the ultra wealthy usually.\n\n3:39:47.740 --> 3:39:50.060\n But when it comes to how to read a face\n\n3:39:50.060 --> 3:39:52.620\n or more importantly, how people are going to read your face,\n\n3:39:52.620 --> 3:39:55.420\n that's extremely important because now you know\n\n3:39:55.420 --> 3:39:58.100\n where to find the first signs of deception\n\n3:39:58.100 --> 3:39:59.620\n in a baseline or anything else.\n\n3:39:59.620 --> 3:40:04.260\n You mentioned that the idea of having privacy\n\n3:40:04.260 --> 3:40:09.260\n is one that we kind of, we think we can,\n\n3:40:10.300 --> 3:40:12.060\n but we really don't.\n\n3:40:12.060 --> 3:40:14.980\n Is it possible for maybe somebody like me\n\n3:40:14.980 --> 3:40:18.060\n or a regular person to disappear from the grid?\n\n3:40:18.060 --> 3:40:18.900\n Absolutely.\n\n3:40:18.900 --> 3:40:20.420\n Yeah, and it's not as hard as you might think.\n\n3:40:20.420 --> 3:40:21.660\n It's not convenient.\n\n3:40:21.660 --> 3:40:24.700\n Again, convenience and security.\n\n3:40:24.700 --> 3:40:26.460\n You can disappear tomorrow, right?\n\n3:40:26.460 --> 3:40:27.780\n I can walk you through three steps right now\n\n3:40:27.780 --> 3:40:29.180\n that are gonna help you disappear tomorrow,\n\n3:40:29.180 --> 3:40:31.300\n but none of them are convenient.\n\n3:40:31.300 --> 3:40:33.580\n They're all extremely secure, right?\n\n3:40:33.580 --> 3:40:35.180\n The first thing you do is every piece\n\n3:40:35.180 --> 3:40:36.860\n of digital technology you have\n\n3:40:36.860 --> 3:40:41.220\n that is connected to you in any way is now dead.\n\n3:40:41.220 --> 3:40:42.500\n You just let the battery run out.\n\n3:40:42.500 --> 3:40:43.340\n Forever.\n\n3:40:43.340 --> 3:40:44.180\n Forever.\n\n3:40:44.180 --> 3:40:46.420\n You never touch it again, starting at this moment.\n\n3:40:46.420 --> 3:40:50.220\n What you have to do is go out and acquire a new one.\n\n3:40:50.220 --> 3:40:52.900\n Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one\n\n3:40:52.900 --> 3:40:55.660\n in the United States by buying it\n\n3:40:55.660 --> 3:40:58.700\n because to do so, you would tie it to your credit card.\n\n3:40:58.700 --> 3:41:00.820\n You would tie it to a location, a time, a place,\n\n3:41:00.820 --> 3:41:02.300\n a registered name, whatever else.\n\n3:41:02.300 --> 3:41:04.820\n So you would have to acquire it essentially by theft\n\n3:41:05.780 --> 3:41:07.460\n or through the black market.\n\n3:41:07.460 --> 3:41:08.700\n So you would want something\n\n3:41:08.700 --> 3:41:11.300\n because you're gonna need the advantage of technology\n\n3:41:11.300 --> 3:41:13.060\n without it being in your name.\n\n3:41:13.060 --> 3:41:16.420\n So you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop.\n\n3:41:16.420 --> 3:41:17.700\n You do whatever you have to do to make sure\n\n3:41:17.700 --> 3:41:19.220\n that you can get on with the password\n\n3:41:19.220 --> 3:41:20.540\n and whatever else that might be.\n\n3:41:20.540 --> 3:41:22.380\n As dirty or as clean as you want that to be,\n\n3:41:22.380 --> 3:41:24.340\n we're all morally flexible here,\n\n3:41:24.340 --> 3:41:27.140\n but now you have a technological device\n\n3:41:27.140 --> 3:41:29.300\n that you can work with.\n\n3:41:29.300 --> 3:41:31.340\n And then from there on,\n\n3:41:31.340 --> 3:41:32.660\n you're just doing whatever you have to do,\n\n3:41:32.660 --> 3:41:35.060\n whether you're stealing every step of the way\n\n3:41:35.060 --> 3:41:38.700\n or whether you run a massive con.\n\n3:41:38.700 --> 3:41:42.300\n Keep in mind that we often talk about con men and cons.\n\n3:41:42.300 --> 3:41:43.500\n Do you know what the root,\n\n3:41:43.500 --> 3:41:46.500\n the word that con is a root word for?\n\n3:41:46.500 --> 3:41:48.020\n Confidence.\n\n3:41:48.020 --> 3:41:49.300\n That's what a con man is.\n\n3:41:49.300 --> 3:41:51.580\n A con man is a confidence man.\n\n3:41:51.580 --> 3:41:54.340\n Just somebody who is so brazenly confident\n\n3:41:54.340 --> 3:41:55.780\n that the people around them\n\n3:41:55.780 --> 3:41:58.620\n living in their own perception, not perspective,\n\n3:41:58.620 --> 3:42:00.340\n and their perception, they're like,\n\n3:42:00.340 --> 3:42:01.980\n well, this guy really knows what he's talking about,\n\n3:42:01.980 --> 3:42:04.020\n so I'm gonna do what he says.\n\n3:42:04.020 --> 3:42:05.580\n So you can run a massive con\n\n3:42:05.580 --> 3:42:07.220\n and that can take care of your finances,\n\n3:42:07.220 --> 3:42:08.500\n that can take care of your lodging,\n\n3:42:08.500 --> 3:42:10.220\n whatever else it is.\n\n3:42:10.220 --> 3:42:13.860\n You are whoever you present yourself to be.\n\n3:42:13.860 --> 3:42:18.300\n So if you wanna go be Bill for the afternoon,\n\n3:42:18.300 --> 3:42:19.820\n just go tell people your name is Bill.\n\n3:42:19.820 --> 3:42:21.500\n They're not gonna question you.\n\n3:42:21.500 --> 3:42:24.060\n So the intelligence,\n\n3:42:24.060 --> 3:42:28.740\n the natural web of intelligence gathering systems\n\n3:42:28.740 --> 3:42:31.980\n we have in the United States and in the world,\n\n3:42:31.980 --> 3:42:35.920\n are they going to believe for long that you're Bill?\n\n3:42:37.020 --> 3:42:37.860\n Are they?\n\n3:42:37.860 --> 3:42:39.900\n Until you do something that makes them think otherwise.\n\n3:42:39.900 --> 3:42:41.040\n If you are consistent,\n\n3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:43.240\n we talked about consistency being the superpower.\n\n3:42:43.240 --> 3:42:46.620\n If you are consistent, they will think you're Bill forever.\n\n3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:49.020\n How difficult is that to do?\n\n3:42:49.020 --> 3:42:50.700\n It's not convenient.\n\n3:42:50.700 --> 3:42:51.900\n It's quite difficult.\n\n3:42:51.900 --> 3:42:53.860\n Does that require training?\n\n3:42:53.860 --> 3:42:55.780\n It does require training.\n\n3:42:55.780 --> 3:42:57.780\n Because why do criminals always get caught?\n\n3:42:57.780 --> 3:42:59.960\n Because they stop being consistent.\n\n3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:02.540\n Criminals, I've...\n\n3:43:04.900 --> 3:43:07.120\n I never hesitate to admit this,\n\n3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:09.020\n but people tell me I should hesitate to admit it.\n\n3:43:09.020 --> 3:43:11.660\n So now I hesitate because of the guidance\n\n3:43:11.660 --> 3:43:13.540\n I've gotten to hesitate, right?\n\n3:43:13.540 --> 3:43:14.380\n I like criminals.\n\n3:43:14.380 --> 3:43:16.420\n I'm friends with a number of criminals\n\n3:43:16.420 --> 3:43:17.940\n because the only people who get me,\n\n3:43:17.940 --> 3:43:20.940\n like right away who get me, are criminals.\n\n3:43:20.940 --> 3:43:23.140\n Because we know what it's like\n\n3:43:23.140 --> 3:43:25.360\n to basically abandon all the rules,\n\n3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:26.660\n do our own thing our own way,\n\n3:43:26.660 --> 3:43:29.080\n and watch the world just keep turning.\n\n3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:33.900\n Most people are so stuck in the trap\n\n3:43:33.900 --> 3:43:36.060\n of normal thought and behavior\n\n3:43:36.060 --> 3:43:37.500\n that when I tell them, they just don't...\n\n3:43:37.500 --> 3:43:39.240\n Just go tell people your name is Bill.\n\n3:43:39.240 --> 3:43:40.340\n Most people are going to say,\n\n3:43:40.340 --> 3:43:42.540\n psh, that's not going to work.\n\n3:43:42.540 --> 3:43:44.680\n But a criminal will be like, oh yeah, I did that once.\n\n3:43:44.680 --> 3:43:46.340\n I just told everybody my name is Nancy,\n\n3:43:46.340 --> 3:43:48.860\n you know, dude, and they still believe me.\n\n3:43:48.860 --> 3:43:50.380\n Criminals just get it, right?\n\n3:43:50.380 --> 3:43:53.540\n So what happens with criminals\n\n3:43:53.540 --> 3:43:56.380\n is they go to the school of hard knocks.\n\n3:43:56.380 --> 3:43:57.220\n They go to...\n\n3:43:57.220 --> 3:44:00.320\n They learn criminal behavior on the job.\n\n3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:02.640\n Spies go to school.\n\n3:44:02.640 --> 3:44:05.020\n We go to the best spy school in the world.\n\n3:44:05.020 --> 3:44:07.860\n We go to Langley's, the farm, right?\n\n3:44:07.860 --> 3:44:10.140\n What's known as Field Tradecraft Course, FTC,\n\n3:44:10.140 --> 3:44:12.420\n in a covert location for a covert period of time\n\n3:44:12.420 --> 3:44:13.520\n and covert, covert, covert.\n\n3:44:13.520 --> 3:44:14.600\n So if anybody from CIA is watching,\n\n3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:16.180\n I'm not breaking any rules.\n\n3:44:16.180 --> 3:44:19.060\n It's all on Wikipedia, but it's not coming from me.\n\n3:44:19.060 --> 3:44:19.900\n But we do...\n\n3:44:19.900 --> 3:44:20.740\n That's how we do it.\n\n3:44:20.740 --> 3:44:24.840\n They train us from a hundred years of experience\n\n3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:27.060\n and the best ways to carry out covert operations,\n\n3:44:27.060 --> 3:44:30.740\n which are all just criminal activities overseas.\n\n3:44:30.740 --> 3:44:32.300\n We learn how to do it the right way\n\n3:44:32.300 --> 3:44:33.300\n so that we don't get caught.\n\n3:44:33.300 --> 3:44:34.420\n We learn how to be consistent.\n\n3:44:34.420 --> 3:44:37.660\n More importantly, we learn how to create an operation\n\n3:44:37.660 --> 3:44:39.900\n that has a limited lifespan\n\n3:44:39.900 --> 3:44:43.120\n because the longer it lives, the more at risk you are.\n\n3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:46.380\n So you want operations to be short, concise,\n\n3:44:46.380 --> 3:44:48.340\n on the X, off the X.\n\n3:44:48.340 --> 3:44:49.740\n Limit your room for mistakes.\n\n3:44:49.740 --> 3:44:52.160\n Criminals want the default\n\n3:44:52.160 --> 3:44:55.020\n to wanting these longterm operations\n\n3:44:55.020 --> 3:44:56.960\n because they don't want to have to recreate a new way\n\n3:44:56.960 --> 3:44:59.000\n to make money every 15 days.\n\n3:45:00.500 --> 3:45:03.940\n You mentioned, if anybody from the CIA is watching,\n\n3:45:03.940 --> 3:45:07.940\n so I've seen you talk about the fact\n\n3:45:07.940 --> 3:45:10.380\n that sort of people that are currently working at the CIA\n\n3:45:10.380 --> 3:45:14.380\n would kind of look down on the people who've left the CIA\n\n3:45:14.380 --> 3:45:16.820\n and they divide them, especially if you go public,\n\n3:45:16.820 --> 3:45:19.880\n especially if there's a book and all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:45:19.880 --> 3:45:22.380\n Do you feel the pressure of that to be quiet,\n\n3:45:23.820 --> 3:45:28.820\n to not do something like this conversation\n\n3:45:30.600 --> 3:45:31.580\n that we're doing today?\n\n3:45:31.580 --> 3:45:33.180\n I feel the silent judgment.\n\n3:45:34.060 --> 3:45:35.380\n That's very real.\n\n3:45:35.380 --> 3:45:36.940\n I feel it for myself and I feel it for my wife\n\n3:45:36.940 --> 3:45:38.600\n who doesn't appear on camera very often,\n\n3:45:38.600 --> 3:45:40.820\n but who's also former CIA.\n\n3:45:40.820 --> 3:45:42.660\n We both feel the judgment.\n\n3:45:42.660 --> 3:45:47.540\n We know that right now, three days after this is released,\n\n3:45:47.540 --> 3:45:50.340\n somebody's gonna send an email on a closed network system\n\n3:45:50.340 --> 3:45:52.900\n inside CIA headquarters and there's a bunch of people\n\n3:45:52.900 --> 3:45:53.840\n who are gonna laugh at it,\n\n3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:56.040\n a bunch of people who are gonna say that who knows what.\n\n3:45:56.040 --> 3:45:56.880\n It's not gonna be good stuff.\n\n3:45:56.880 --> 3:45:58.640\n A bunch of people you respect probably.\n\n3:45:58.640 --> 3:46:01.980\n A bunch of people who I'm trying to bring honor to.\n\n3:46:01.980 --> 3:46:04.780\n Whether I know them or respect them is irrelevant.\n\n3:46:04.780 --> 3:46:08.000\n These are people who are out there doing the deed every day\n\n3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:11.300\n and I wanna bring them honor and I wanna do that in a way\n\n3:46:11.300 --> 3:46:14.120\n that I get to share what they can't share\n\n3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:16.240\n and what they won't share when they leave\n\n3:46:16.240 --> 3:46:18.440\n because they will also feel the silent pressure,\n\n3:46:18.440 --> 3:46:21.720\n the pressure to the shame, the judgment, right?\n\n3:46:22.740 --> 3:46:25.440\n But the truth is that I've done this now long enough.\n\n3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:27.960\n The first few times that I spoke out publicly,\n\n3:46:29.340 --> 3:46:32.160\n the response to being a positive voice\n\n3:46:32.160 --> 3:46:34.960\n for what the sacrifice is that people are making,\n\n3:46:34.960 --> 3:46:39.020\n it's so refreshing to be an honest voice\n\n3:46:39.020 --> 3:46:43.120\n that people don't normally hear that it's too important.\n\n3:46:43.120 --> 3:46:44.280\n One day I'm gonna be gone\n\n3:46:44.280 --> 3:46:46.340\n and my kids are gonna look back on all this\n\n3:46:46.340 --> 3:46:48.360\n and they're gonna see their dad\n\n3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:51.000\n trying to do the right thing for the right reasons\n\n3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:53.480\n and even if my son or daughter ends up at CIA\n\n3:46:53.480 --> 3:46:55.280\n and even if they get ridiculed for being,\n\n3:46:55.280 --> 3:46:57.640\n oh, you're the Bustamante kid, right?\n\n3:46:57.640 --> 3:47:00.080\n Your dad's a total sellout, whatever it might be.\n\n3:47:01.100 --> 3:47:04.700\n Like I want them to know dad was doing what he could\n\n3:47:04.700 --> 3:47:06.560\n to bring honor to the organization\n\n3:47:06.560 --> 3:47:09.480\n even when he couldn't stay in the organization anymore.\n\n3:47:09.480 --> 3:47:11.480\n So you said when you were 27,\n\n3:47:11.480 --> 3:47:13.980\n I think you didn't know what the hell you're doing.\n\n3:47:15.280 --> 3:47:20.280\n So now that you're a few years older and wiser,\n\n3:47:21.240 --> 3:47:24.840\n let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat\n\n3:47:24.840 --> 3:47:27.480\n and give advice to other 27 year olds\n\n3:47:27.480 --> 3:47:30.960\n or even younger 17, 18 year olds\n\n3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:34.200\n that are just out of high school, maybe going to college,\n\n3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:35.520\n trying to figure out this life,\n\n3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:37.640\n this career thing that they're on.\n\n3:47:37.640 --> 3:47:39.840\n What advice would you give them\n\n3:47:39.840 --> 3:47:42.040\n about how to have a career\n\n3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:44.520\n or how to have a life they can be proud of?\n\n3:47:45.800 --> 3:47:47.440\n What's a powerful question, man?\n\n3:47:49.600 --> 3:47:51.160\n Have you figured it out yet yourself?\n\n3:47:51.160 --> 3:47:55.160\n No, I think I'm a grand total of seven days smarter\n\n3:47:55.160 --> 3:47:56.240\n than I was at 27.\n\n3:47:57.120 --> 3:47:57.960\n It's not a good average.\n\n3:47:57.960 --> 3:47:58.800\n Progress.\n\n3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:01.080\n There's still time.\n\n3:48:01.080 --> 3:48:02.680\n There's still time.\n\n3:48:02.680 --> 3:48:07.120\n So for all the young people out there deciding what to do,\n\n3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:10.720\n I would just say the same thing that I do say\n\n3:48:10.720 --> 3:48:12.400\n and I will say to my own kids.\n\n3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:14.360\n You only have one life.\n\n3:48:14.360 --> 3:48:16.600\n You only have one chance.\n\n3:48:16.600 --> 3:48:20.300\n If you spend it doing what other people expect you to do,\n\n3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:25.400\n you will wake up to your regret at some point.\n\n3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:29.200\n I woke up when I was 38 years old.\n\n3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:32.000\n My wife in many ways is still waking up to it\n\n3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:34.760\n as she watches her grandparents pass\n\n3:48:34.760 --> 3:48:37.440\n and an older generation pass away.\n\n3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:42.880\n The folks that really have a blessed life\n\n3:48:42.880 --> 3:48:45.160\n are the people who learn early on\n\n3:48:45.160 --> 3:48:49.280\n to live with their own rules, live their own way\n\n3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:52.920\n and live every day as if it's the last day.\n\n3:48:53.720 --> 3:48:58.080\n Not necessarily to waste it by being wasteful or silly,\n\n3:48:58.080 --> 3:49:00.000\n but to recognize that today is a day\n\n3:49:00.000 --> 3:49:04.560\n to be productive and constructive for yourself.\n\n3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:06.100\n If you don't want a career,\n\n3:49:06.100 --> 3:49:07.840\n today's not the day to start pursuing a career\n\n3:49:07.840 --> 3:49:09.680\n just because someone else told you to do it.\n\n3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:11.160\n If you wanna learn a language,\n\n3:49:11.160 --> 3:49:13.720\n today's a day to find a way to buy a ticket\n\n3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:15.680\n to another country and learn through immersion.\n\n3:49:15.680 --> 3:49:17.920\n If you want a date, if you wanna get married,\n\n3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:19.800\n if you want a business,\n\n3:49:19.800 --> 3:49:21.520\n today is the day to just go out\n\n3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:25.200\n and take one step in that direction.\n\n3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:28.600\n And as long as you, every day you just make one new step,\n\n3:49:28.600 --> 3:49:32.120\n just like CIA recruited me, just do the next thing.\n\n3:49:32.120 --> 3:49:34.520\n If the step seems like it's too big,\n\n3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:36.100\n then there's probably two other steps\n\n3:49:36.100 --> 3:49:37.680\n that you can do before that.\n\n3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:40.440\n Just make constant progress, build momentum,\n\n3:49:40.440 --> 3:49:43.960\n move forward and live on your own terms.\n\n3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:47.040\n That way you don't ever wake up to the regret.\n\n3:49:47.040 --> 3:49:50.000\n And it'll be over before you know it.\n\n3:49:50.000 --> 3:49:52.000\n Whether you regret it or not, it's true.\n\n3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:55.540\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n3:49:55.540 --> 3:49:56.720\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:00.240\n Self respect, that's a fast answer.\n\n3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:01.960\n There's a story behind it if you want the story.\n\n3:50:01.960 --> 3:50:03.720\n I would love to have the story.\n\n3:50:03.720 --> 3:50:08.080\n There's a covert training base in Alabama in the south,\n\n3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:10.200\n far south and like the armpit of America\n\n3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:12.560\n where elite tier one operators\n\n3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:16.100\n go to learn human intelligence stuff.\n\n3:50:16.100 --> 3:50:18.960\n And there's a bar inside this base.\n\n3:50:18.960 --> 3:50:23.960\n And on the wall is just, it's scribbles of opinions.\n\n3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:25.640\n And the question in the middle of the wall\n\n3:50:25.640 --> 3:50:27.400\n says what's the meaning of life?\n\n3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:31.080\n And all these elite operators over the last 25 or 30 years,\n\n3:50:31.080 --> 3:50:33.560\n they all go, they get drunk and they scribble their answer\n\n3:50:33.560 --> 3:50:35.200\n and they circle it with a Sharpie, right?\n\n3:50:35.200 --> 3:50:40.200\n Love, family, America, freedom, right, whatever.\n\n3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:41.560\n And then the only thing they have to do\n\n3:50:41.560 --> 3:50:43.080\n is if they're gonna write something on there,\n\n3:50:43.080 --> 3:50:46.040\n they have to connect it with something else on the wall,\n\n3:50:46.040 --> 3:50:47.040\n at least one other thing.\n\n3:50:47.040 --> 3:50:48.840\n So if they write love, they can't just leave it\n\n3:50:48.840 --> 3:50:51.560\n floating there, they have to write love in a little bubble\n\n3:50:51.560 --> 3:50:53.960\n and connect it to something else, connect it to family,\n\n3:50:53.960 --> 3:50:54.800\n whatever else.\n\n3:50:54.800 --> 3:50:56.160\n When you look at that wall,\n\n3:50:58.080 --> 3:51:00.600\n the word self respect is on the wall\n\n3:51:00.600 --> 3:51:02.400\n and it's got a circle around it.\n\n3:51:02.400 --> 3:51:04.600\n And then you can't see any other word\n\n3:51:04.600 --> 3:51:07.680\n because of all the things that connect to self respect.\n\n3:51:08.720 --> 3:51:11.920\n Just dozens of people have written over,\n\n3:51:11.920 --> 3:51:14.040\n have written their words down and been drawn\n\n3:51:14.040 --> 3:51:15.880\n and scribbled over because of all the lines\n\n3:51:15.880 --> 3:51:17.200\n that connect to self respect.\n\n3:51:17.200 --> 3:51:18.920\n So what's the meaning of life?\n\n3:51:18.920 --> 3:51:19.760\n From my point of view,\n\n3:51:19.760 --> 3:51:22.200\n I've never seen a better answer.\n\n3:51:22.200 --> 3:51:23.040\n It's all self respect.\n\n3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:25.440\n If you don't respect yourself, how can you do anything else?\n\n3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:26.280\n How can you love someone else\n\n3:51:26.280 --> 3:51:27.680\n if you don't have self respect?\n\n3:51:27.680 --> 3:51:28.840\n How can you build a business you're proud of\n\n3:51:28.840 --> 3:51:29.880\n if you don't have self respect?\n\n3:51:29.880 --> 3:51:31.120\n How can you raise kids?\n\n3:51:31.120 --> 3:51:32.280\n How can you make a difference?\n\n3:51:32.280 --> 3:51:33.880\n How can you pioneer anything?\n\n3:51:33.880 --> 3:51:37.080\n How can you just wake up and have a good day\n\n3:51:37.080 --> 3:51:39.160\n if you don't have self respect?\n\n3:51:40.840 --> 3:51:42.240\n The power of the individual,\n\n3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:46.360\n that's what makes this country great.\n\n3:51:46.360 --> 3:51:49.000\n I have to say, after I was born,\n\n3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:52.200\n I have to say after traveling quite a bit in Europe\n\n3:51:52.200 --> 3:51:55.720\n and especially in a place of war,\n\n3:51:55.720 --> 3:51:57.080\n coming back to the United States\n\n3:51:57.080 --> 3:51:58.400\n makes me really appreciate\n\n3:51:58.400 --> 3:52:02.280\n about the better angels of this nation,\n\n3:52:02.280 --> 3:52:04.960\n the ideals it stands for, the values it stands for.\n\n3:52:04.960 --> 3:52:09.960\n And I'd like to thank you for serving this nation for time\n\n3:52:10.040 --> 3:52:11.800\n and humanity for time\n\n3:52:12.640 --> 3:52:16.800\n and for being brave enough and bold enough\n\n3:52:16.800 --> 3:52:19.480\n to still talk about it and to inspire others,\n\n3:52:19.480 --> 3:52:24.480\n to educate others for having many amazing conversations\n\n3:52:25.120 --> 3:52:28.480\n and for honoring me by having this conversation today.\n\n3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:30.080\n You're an amazing human.\n\n3:52:30.080 --> 3:52:31.360\n Thanks so much for talking today.\n\n3:52:31.360 --> 3:52:32.760\n Lex, I appreciate the invite, man.\n\n3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:33.600\n It was a joy.\n\n3:52:34.600 --> 3:52:36.240\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:52:36.240 --> 3:52:38.000\n with Andrew Bustamante.\n\n3:52:38.000 --> 3:52:39.160\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:52:39.160 --> 3:52:41.680\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:52:41.680 --> 3:52:44.120\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n3:52:44.120 --> 3:52:47.000\n from Sun Tzu in The Art of War.\n\n3:52:47.920 --> 3:52:52.160\n Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night.\n\n3:52:52.160 --> 3:52:55.400\n And when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.\n\n3:52:55.400 --> 3:53:14.400\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
