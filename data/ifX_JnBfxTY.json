sadness and hope run through his heart and his mind,\n\n00:10.060 --> 00:13.700\n and the result is a complicated, brilliant human being\n\n00:13.700 --> 00:15.980\n who I am fortunate to call a friend.\n\n00:16.840 --> 00:18.660\n Quick mention of our sponsors.\n\n00:18.660 --> 00:22.460\n Indeed hiring site, Theragun muscle recovery device,\n\n00:22.460 --> 00:24.780\n Wine Access online

podcast.\n\n00:32.100 --> 00:34.080\n As a side note, let me ask\n\n00:34.080 --> 00:36.660\n that whenever we touch difficult topics in this\n\n00:36.660 --> 00:40.420\n or other conversations, that you listen with an open mind\n\n00:40.420 --> 00:43.980\n and forgive me or the guest for a misstep\n\n00:43.980 --> 00:46.740\n in an imperfectly thought out statement.\n\n00:46.740 --> 00:48.320\n To have any chance at truth,\n\n00:48.320 --> 00:50.100\n I think we have to take risks\n\n00:50.100 --> 00:52.740\n and make mistakes in conversation\n\n00:52.740 --> 00:54.780\n and then learn from those mistakes.\n\n00:54.780 --> 00:57.380\n Please try not to close your mind and heart to others\n\n00:57.380 --> 01:00.940\n because of a single sentence or an expression of an idea.\n\n01:00.940 --> 01:03.440\n Try to assume that the people in this conversation\n\n01:03.440 --> 01:06.120\n or just people in general are good,\n\n01:06.120 --> 01:08.700\n but not perfect and far from it,\n\n01:08.700 --> 01:11.820\n but always striving to add a bit more love into the world\n\n01:11.820 --> 01:13.780\n in whatever way we know how.\n\n01:14.660 --> 01:17.020\n If you enjoy this

with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n01:24.260 --> 01:28.520\n And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein.\n\n01:29.620 --> 01:31.860\n You often talk about getting off this planet\n\n01:32.900 --> 01:35.980\n and I think you don't often talk\n\n01:35.980 --> 01:40.980\n about extra terrestrial life, intelligent life out there.\n\n01:41.140 --> 01:42.740\n Do you wonder about this kind of thing,\n\n01:42.740 --> 01:44.980\n about intelligent civilizations out there?\n\n01:44.980 --> 01:48.540\n I do, but I try to not wonder about it in a particular way.\n\n01:50.360 --> 01:53.040\n In a certain sense, I do find that speculating\n\n01:53.040 --> 01:55.820\n about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster and space aliens\n\n01:55.820 --> 01:57.100\n is kind of a recreation\n\n01:57.100 --> 01:59.100\n for when things aren't going very well.\n\n02:00.180 --> 02:03.540\n At least it gives us some meaning and purpose in our lives.\n\n02:03.540 --> 02:06.260\n So I worry about, for example,\n\n02:06.260 --> 02:09.380\n the simulation hypothesis is taking over from religion.\n\n02:09.380 --> 02:11.620\n You can't quite believe enough to go to church\n\n02:11.620 --> 02:14.300\n or synagogue or the mosque on the weekend,\n\n02:14.300 --> 02:17.900\n so then you just take up an interest in simulation theory\n\n02:17.900 --> 02:19.140\n because that's something like what you do\n\n02:19.140 --> 02:21.000\n for your job coding.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.220\n I do think that in some sense,\n\n02:23.220 --> 02:26.360\n the issue of aliens is a really interesting one,\n\n02:26.360 --> 02:28.460\n but has been spoiled by too much\n\n02:28.460 --> 02:31.540\n sort of recreational escapism.\n\n02:32.460 --> 02:36.780\n The key question that I find is let's assume\n\n02:36.780 --> 02:40.220\n that it is possible to look out at the night sky\n\n02:40.220 --> 02:43.700\n and see all of these distant worlds and then go visit them.\n\n02:43.700 --> 02:46.300\n If that is possible, it's almost certainly possible\n\n02:46.300 --> 02:51.300\n through some as yet unknown or not accepted theory\n\n02:52.820 --> 02:54.520\n of physics beyond Einstein.\n\n02:55.540 --> 02:59.200\n And I mean, it doesn't have to be that way, but probably is.\n\n03:00.400 --> 03:04.180\n If that theory exists, there would be a percentage\n\n03:04.180 --> 03:05.540\n of the worlds that have life\n\n03:05.540 --> 03:07.520\n in sort of a Drake equation kind of a way\n\n03:07.520 --> 03:11.500\n that would have encountered the ability to escape\n\n03:11.500 --> 03:16.500\n soon enough after unlocking the power of the atom\n\n03:17.220 --> 03:19.100\n at a minimum and whatever they have\n\n03:19.100 --> 03:24.100\n that is probably analogous to the cell on that world.\n\n03:24.420 --> 03:29.020\n So assuming that life is a fairly generic thing\n\n03:29.020 --> 03:32.500\n that arises, probably not carbon based,\n\n03:32.500 --> 03:33.660\n probably doesn't have DNA,\n\n03:33.660 --> 03:37.180\n but that something that fits the pattern\n\n03:37.180 --> 03:42.180\n of Darwinian theory, which is descent with variation,\n\n03:43.820 --> 03:45.500\n differential success.\n\n03:45.500 --> 03:47.420\n And thereby constantly improving and so on\n\n03:47.420 --> 03:50.120\n that through time, there'll be a trajectory\n\n03:50.120 --> 03:53.180\n where there'll be something increasingly complex\n\n03:53.180 --> 03:56.500\n and fascinating and beautiful like us humans, but much more.\n\n03:56.500 --> 03:59.700\n That can also off gas whatever entropy it creates\n\n03:59.700 --> 04:03.200\n to give an illusion that you're defeating thermodynamics.\n\n04:03.200 --> 04:05.740\n So whatever these things are probably has an analog\n\n04:05.740 --> 04:08.620\n of the biolipid layer so that cells can get rid\n\n04:08.620 --> 04:11.220\n of the chaos on one side of the barrier\n\n04:11.220 --> 04:12.860\n and keep order on the other.\n\n04:12.860 --> 04:15.580\n Whatever these things are that create life,\n\n04:15.580 --> 04:17.500\n assuming that there is a theory to be found\n\n04:17.500 --> 04:21.060\n that allows that civilization to diversify,\n\n04:22.420 --> 04:26.340\n we would have to imagine that such a civilization\n\n04:26.340 --> 04:29.580\n might have taken an interest in its concept\n\n04:29.580 --> 04:31.380\n of the universe and have come here.\n\n04:31.380 --> 04:36.380\n They would come here, they would have a deep understanding\n\n04:36.540 --> 04:38.220\n of the physics of the universe sufficient\n\n04:38.220 --> 04:40.900\n to have arrived here.\n\n04:40.900 --> 04:41.740\n Well, there's two questions,\n\n04:41.740 --> 04:43.220\n whether they could arrive physically\n\n04:43.220 --> 04:47.800\n and whether their information could be sent here\n\n04:47.800 --> 04:50.460\n and whether they could gain information from us.\n\n04:50.460 --> 04:53.780\n It's possible that they would have a way\n\n04:53.780 --> 04:57.260\n of looking into our world without actually reaching it.\n\n04:57.260 --> 04:58.540\n I don't know.\n\n04:58.540 --> 05:03.340\n But yes, if my hope, which is that we can escape this world,\n\n05:04.900 --> 05:07.720\n can be realized, if that's feasible,\n\n05:07.720 --> 05:10.540\n then you would have to imagine that the reverse is true\n\n05:10.540 --> 05:15.020\n and that somebody else should be here.\n\n05:15.020 --> 05:17.220\n First of all, I wanna say this.\n\n05:17.220 --> 05:19.900\n My purpose when I come on to your show\n\n05:19.900 --> 05:24.180\n and I reframe the questions is not to challenge you.\n\n05:24.180 --> 05:26.020\n I can sit inside all of those.\n\n05:26.020 --> 05:27.680\n It's to give you better audio and video\n\n05:27.680 --> 05:29.880\n because I think we've been on an incredible role.\n\n05:29.880 --> 05:31.540\n I really love what you do.\n\n05:31.540 --> 05:35.100\n And so I am trying to honor you by being as disagreeable\n\n05:35.100 --> 05:36.560\n about frame breaking as possible.\n\n05:36.560 --> 05:38.920\n I think some of your listeners don't understand\n\n05:38.920 --> 05:40.500\n that it's actually a sign of respect\n\n05:40.500 --> 05:43.260\n as opposed to some sort of a complex dynamic,\n\n05:43.260 --> 05:46.780\n which is I think you can play outside of some of the frames\n\n05:46.780 --> 05:48.280\n and that these are sort of offerings\n\n05:48.280 --> 05:49.640\n to get the conversation started.\n\n05:49.640 --> 05:51.140\n So let me try to break that frame\n\n05:51.140 --> 05:52.460\n and give you something different.\n\n05:52.460 --> 05:53.300\n Beautiful.\n\n05:53.300 --> 05:58.300\n I think what's going on here is that I can prove effectively\n\n06:00.420 --> 06:03.220\n that we're not thinking about this in very deep terms.\n\n06:03.220 --> 06:05.820\n As soon as I say we've gotta get off this planet,\n\n06:05.820 --> 06:07.540\n the number of people who assume\n\n06:07.540 --> 06:12.540\n that I'm talking about faster than light travel is very high\n\n06:12.700 --> 06:15.740\n and faster than light travel assumes some sort\n\n06:15.740 --> 06:18.700\n of Einsteinian paradigm that then is broken\n\n06:20.340 --> 06:22.220\n by some small adjustment.\n\n06:22.220 --> 06:24.740\n And I think that that's fascinating.\n\n06:24.740 --> 06:27.560\n It shows me that our failure to imagine\n\n06:27.560 --> 06:30.700\n what could be being said is profound.\n\n06:30.700 --> 06:35.700\n We don't have an idea of all of the different ways\n\n06:35.860 --> 06:39.640\n in which we might be able to visit distant worlds.\n\n06:40.640 --> 06:42.980\n All we think about is, okay,\n\n06:42.980 --> 06:45.380\n it must be Einsteinian space times\n\n06:45.380 --> 06:48.220\n and then some means of exceeding the speed limit.\n\n06:48.220 --> 06:50.420\n And it's just, it's fascinating to me\n\n06:50.420 --> 06:55.420\n that we don't really have, we've lost the ability\n\n06:55.940 --> 06:59.540\n to just realize we don't know the framework\n\n06:59.540 --> 07:01.360\n and what does it even mean?\n\n07:01.360 --> 07:03.140\n So one of the things I think about a lot\n\n07:03.140 --> 07:05.660\n is worlds with more than one temporal dimension.\n\n07:06.940 --> 07:08.540\n It's very hard to think about\n\n07:08.540 --> 07:10.880\n more than one temporal dimension.\n\n07:10.880 --> 07:14.820\n So that's a really strong mental exercise\n\n07:14.820 --> 07:17.300\n of breaking the framework in which we think\n\n07:17.300 --> 07:18.980\n because most of the frameworks\n\n07:18.980 --> 07:20.980\n would have a single temporal dimension, right?\n\n07:20.980 --> 07:22.900\n Well, first of all, most of the frameworks\n\n07:22.900 --> 07:25.060\n in which we think would have no temporal dimension\n\n07:25.060 --> 07:27.020\n would have pure, like in mathematics,\n\n07:27.020 --> 07:30.340\n the differential geometry that Riemann came up with\n\n07:30.340 --> 07:31.620\n in the 1800s.\n\n07:32.980 --> 07:35.220\n We don't usually talk about\n\n07:35.220 --> 07:37.940\n what we would call split signature metrics\n\n07:37.940 --> 07:39.940\n or Lorentzian signature.\n\n07:39.940 --> 07:41.740\n In fact, if it weren't for relativity,\n\n07:41.740 --> 07:45.580\n this would be the most obscure topic out there.\n\n07:45.580 --> 07:48.220\n Almost all the work we do is in Euclidean signature\n\n07:48.220 --> 07:50.220\n and then there's this one freakish case\n\n07:50.220 --> 07:52.060\n of relativity theory in physics\n\n07:52.060 --> 07:55.760\n that uses this one time and the rest spatial dimensions.\n\n07:56.940 --> 07:57.860\n Fascinating.\n\n07:57.860 --> 08:01.100\n So it's usually momentary and just looking at space.\n\n08:01.100 --> 08:05.420\n Yes, we have these three kinds of equations\n\n08:05.420 --> 08:06.740\n that are very important to us.\n\n08:06.740 --> 08:11.340\n We have elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic, right?\n\n08:11.340 --> 08:15.140\n And so the idea is if I'm chewing gum\n\n08:15.140 --> 08:20.140\n after eating garlic bread, when I open my mouth\n\n08:20.820 --> 08:23.940\n and I've got chewing gum between my lips,\n\n08:23.940 --> 08:27.040\n maybe it's gonna form an elliptic object\n\n08:27.040 --> 08:29.100\n called a minimal surface.\n\n08:29.100 --> 08:31.260\n Then when I pop that and blow through it,\n\n08:31.260 --> 08:33.520\n you're gonna hear a noise that's gonna travel to you\n\n08:33.520 --> 08:36.280\n by a wave equation, which is gonna be hyperbolic.\n\n08:36.280 --> 08:38.940\n But then the garlic breath is gonna diffuse towards you\n\n08:38.940 --> 08:41.220\n and you're eventually gonna be very upset with me\n\n08:41.220 --> 08:44.040\n according to a heat equation, which will be parabolic.\n\n08:44.040 --> 08:46.620\n So those are the three basic paradigms\n\n08:46.620 --> 08:48.220\n for most of the work that we do.\n\n08:48.220 --> 08:52.300\n And a lot of the work that we do in mathematics is elliptic,\n\n08:52.300 --> 08:54.700\n whereas the physicists are in the hyperbolic case.\n\n08:54.700 --> 08:55.780\n And I don't even know what to do\n\n08:55.780 --> 08:57.540\n about more than one temporal dimension\n\n08:57.540 --> 08:59.920\n because I think almost no one studies that.\n\n08:59.920 --> 09:04.140\n I can't believe you just captured much of modern physics\n\n09:04.140 --> 09:05.820\n in the example of chewing gum.\n\n09:05.820 --> 09:08.060\n Well, I have an off color one, which I chose not to share,\n\n09:08.060 --> 09:11.140\n but hopefully the kids at home can imagine.\n\n09:11.140 --> 09:16.140\n Okay, so, okay, that is the place where we come from.\n\n09:16.760 --> 09:19.040\n Now, if we want to arrive at a possibility\n\n09:19.040 --> 09:22.760\n of breaking the frameworks with two\n\n09:22.760 --> 09:25.640\n versus zero temporal dimensions,\n\n09:25.640 --> 09:27.120\n how do we even begin to think about that?\n\n09:27.120 --> 09:29.600\n Well, let's think about it as you and I getting together\n\n09:29.600 --> 09:31.920\n in New York City, okay?\n\n09:31.920 --> 09:36.600\n So if you tell me, Eric, I wanna meet you in New York City,\n\n09:36.600 --> 09:41.400\n go to the corner of, I don't know, 34th Street\n\n09:41.400 --> 09:43.960\n and Third Avenue, and you'll find a building\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:48.620\n on the Northwest corner and go up to the 17th floor, right?\n\n09:48.620 --> 09:51.520\n So when we have Third Avenue, that's one coordinate,\n\n09:51.520 --> 09:53.680\n 34th Street, that's the second coordinate,\n\n09:53.680 --> 09:55.160\n and go up to the 17th.\n\n09:55.160 --> 09:56.080\n And what time is it?\n\n09:56.080 --> 09:57.020\n Oh, 12 noon.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.880\n All right, well, now imagine that we traded the ability\n\n10:01.880 --> 10:03.920\n to get up to a particular height in a building\n\n10:03.920 --> 10:05.240\n and it's all flat land,\n\n10:05.240 --> 10:07.400\n but I'm gonna give you two temporal coordinates.\n\n10:07.400 --> 10:11.360\n So meet me at 5 p.m. and 12 noon\n\n10:11.360 --> 10:13.400\n at the corner of 34th and Third.\n\n10:13.400 --> 10:15.120\n That gets to be too mind blowing.\n\n10:15.120 --> 10:17.280\n I've got two separate watches.\n\n10:17.280 --> 10:20.600\n And presumably that's just specifying a single point\n\n10:20.600 --> 10:22.540\n in those two different dimensions,\n\n10:22.540 --> 10:25.520\n but then being able to travel along those dimensions.\n\n10:25.520 --> 10:27.060\n Let me see your right hand.\n\n10:28.740 --> 10:30.300\n You have no watch on that.\n\n10:30.300 --> 10:31.140\n No.\n\n10:31.140 --> 10:32.900\n Okay, I'm very concerned, Lex,\n\n10:32.900 --> 10:36.760\n that you're going through life without a wristwatch.\n\n10:36.760 --> 10:39.720\n That is my favorite and most valued wristwatch.\n\n10:39.720 --> 10:40.940\n I want you to wear it.\n\n10:40.940 --> 10:45.200\n This guy is funnier than basically any human on Earth.\n\n10:45.200 --> 10:48.120\n Lex, that has been in my family for months.\n\n10:49.600 --> 10:51.160\n It's a Fitbit.\n\n10:51.160 --> 10:53.560\n Now, what I want you to understand is Lex Fridman\n\n10:53.560 --> 10:57.440\n is now in a position to live in two spatial\n\n10:57.440 --> 11:00.400\n and two temporal dimensions unlike the rest of us.\n\n11:00.400 --> 11:04.760\n I clearly am only fit for four spatial dimensions.\n\n11:04.760 --> 11:07.920\n So I'm frozen, whereas you can double move.\n\n11:07.920 --> 11:09.620\n I can double move, which is funny\n\n11:09.620 --> 11:12.760\n because this is set in Austin time.\n\n11:12.760 --> 11:16.360\n So it's 4 p.m. and this is set in Los Angeles time.\n\n11:16.360 --> 11:18.920\n Well, but that's just with an affine shift in mod 12.\n\n11:18.920 --> 11:22.140\n But my point is, wouldn't that be interesting\n\n11:22.140 --> 11:23.520\n if there were two separate time scales\n\n11:23.520 --> 11:25.680\n and you had to coordinate both of those,\n\n11:25.680 --> 11:27.200\n but you didn't have to worry about what floor\n\n11:27.200 --> 11:30.320\n of the building because everything was on the ground floor.\n\n11:30.320 --> 11:32.780\n That is the confusion that we're having.\n\n11:33.840 --> 11:36.600\n And if you do one more show, right,\n\n11:36.600 --> 11:38.040\n then they're gonna put a watch on your ankle\n\n11:38.040 --> 11:40.160\n and you're only gonna have one spatial dimension\n\n11:40.160 --> 11:41.040\n that you can move around.\n\n11:41.040 --> 11:45.360\n But my claim is that all of these are actually sectors\n\n11:45.360 --> 11:48.200\n of my theory in case we're interested in that,\n\n11:48.200 --> 11:50.160\n which is geometric unity.\n\n11:50.160 --> 11:53.700\n There is a two, two sector and a three, one and a one, three\n\n11:53.700 --> 11:55.380\n and a zero, four and a four, zero.\n\n11:55.380 --> 11:58.600\n And all of these sectors have some physical reality.\n\n11:58.600 --> 12:01.440\n We happen to live in a one, three sector.\n\n12:01.440 --> 12:04.920\n But that's the kind of thinking that we don't do.\n\n12:04.920 --> 12:06.660\n When I say we have to get off this planet,\n\n12:06.660 --> 12:08.640\n people imagine, oh, okay, it's just Einstein\n\n12:08.640 --> 12:10.940\n plus some ability to break the law.\n\n12:10.940 --> 12:14.160\n By the way, even though you did this for humor's sake,\n\n12:14.160 --> 12:19.160\n I perhaps am tempted to pull a Putin who.\n\n12:19.760 --> 12:20.840\n Am I gonna get whacked?\n\n12:20.840 --> 12:23.000\n No, not quite.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:27.600\n But he was given a Super Bowl ring to look at\n\n12:27.600 --> 12:29.920\n and he, instead of just looking at it,\n\n12:29.920 --> 12:32.440\n put it on his finger and walked away with it.\n\n12:32.440 --> 12:33.280\n Rubbercraft?\n\n12:33.280 --> 12:34.120\n Rubbercraft, that's right.\n\n12:34.120 --> 12:38.160\n So in the same way, I will, if you don't mind,\n\n12:38.160 --> 12:39.500\n walk away with this Fitbit\n\n12:39.500 --> 12:42.080\n and taking the entirety of your life story with it\n\n12:42.080 --> 12:43.880\n because there's all these steps on it.\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:45.880\n Boy, have you lost a lot of weight.\n\n12:45.880 --> 12:49.160\n And where have I been?\n\n12:49.160 --> 12:50.740\n Exactly.\n\n12:50.740 --> 12:52.200\n Right, that's what we're talking about.\n\n12:52.200 --> 12:53.800\n We're talking about, you wanna get into aliens,\n\n12:53.800 --> 12:55.520\n let's have an interesting alien conversation.\n\n12:55.520 --> 12:58.920\n Let's stop having the typical free will conversation,\n\n12:58.920 --> 13:00.360\n the typical alien conversation,\n\n13:00.360 --> 13:02.840\n the typical AGI morality conversation.\n\n13:02.840 --> 13:05.720\n It's like, we have to recognize that we're amusing ourselves\n\n13:05.720 --> 13:07.600\n because we're not making progress.\n\n13:07.600 --> 13:10.400\n Time to have better versions of all these conversations.\n\n13:10.400 --> 13:13.020\n Is there some version of the alien conversation\n\n13:13.020 --> 13:15.880\n that could incorporate the breaking of frameworks?\n\n13:15.880 --> 13:16.720\n Well, I think so.\n\n13:16.720 --> 13:18.680\n I mean, the key question would be,\n\n13:18.680 --> 13:21.620\n we've had the Pentagon release multiple videos\n\n13:21.620 --> 13:25.080\n of strange UFOs that undermined a lot of us.\n\n13:25.080 --> 13:26.960\n I just think it's also really fascinating\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:29.240\n to talk about the fact that those of us\n\n13:29.240 --> 13:33.080\n who were trained to call BS on all of this stuff\n\n13:33.080 --> 13:35.120\n just had the rug pulled out from under us\n\n13:35.120 --> 13:36.700\n by the Pentagon choosing to do this.\n\n13:36.700 --> 13:38.400\n And you know what the effect of that is?\n\n13:38.400 --> 13:43.400\n You've opened the door for every stupid theory known to man.\n\n13:44.040 --> 13:45.540\n My aunt saw a ghost.\n\n13:46.640 --> 13:48.980\n Okay, now we're gonna have to listen to,\n\n13:48.980 --> 13:51.000\n well, hey, the Pentagon used to deny it.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.100\n Then it turned out there were UFOs, dude.\n\n13:53.100 --> 13:57.960\n Whoever is in charge of lying to the public,\n\n13:58.860 --> 14:01.020\n they need a cost function that incorporates\n\n14:01.020 --> 14:04.220\n the damage and trust because I held this line\n\n14:04.220 --> 14:07.260\n that this was all garbage and all BS.\n\n14:07.260 --> 14:09.100\n Now I don't know what to think.\n\n14:09.100 --> 14:11.500\n There's a fascinating aspect to this alien discussion,\n\n14:11.500 --> 14:13.380\n the breaking of frameworks that involves\n\n14:13.380 --> 14:15.940\n the release of videos from the Pentagon,\n\n14:15.940 --> 14:18.300\n which is almost like another dimension\n\n14:18.300 --> 14:21.960\n that trust in itself or the nature of truth and information\n\n14:21.960 --> 14:24.780\n is a kind of dimension along which we're traveling\n\n14:24.780 --> 14:29.180\n constantly that is messing with my head to think about\n\n14:29.180 --> 14:34.180\n because it almost feels like you need to incorporate that\n\n14:35.940 --> 14:38.400\n into your study of the nature of reality\n\n14:38.400 --> 14:43.180\n is like the constant shifting of the notation,\n\n14:43.180 --> 14:45.940\n the tools we use to communicate that reality.\n\n14:45.940 --> 14:48.960\n And so what am I supposed to think about these videos?\n\n14:48.960 --> 14:51.320\n Is it a complete distraction?\n\n14:51.320 --> 14:53.300\n Is it a kind of cosmic joke?\n\n14:53.300 --> 14:54.620\n I don't know, but you know what?\n\n14:54.620 --> 14:55.540\n I'm tired of these people,\n\n14:55.540 --> 14:57.500\n just completely tired of these people.\n\n14:57.500 --> 14:59.020\n The people on the Pentagon side\n\n14:59.020 --> 15:00.500\n or the people who are interpreting this stuff\n\n15:00.500 --> 15:01.340\n on the Pentagon side?\n\n15:01.340 --> 15:05.860\n I'm tired of the authorities playing games\n\n15:05.860 --> 15:08.340\n with what we can know.\n\n15:08.340 --> 15:09.500\n The fact that you and I don't,\n\n15:09.500 --> 15:11.740\n do you have a security clearance?\n\n15:11.740 --> 15:13.100\n Some level of it for,\n\n15:13.100 --> 15:15.180\n because I was funded for DARPA for a while.\n\n15:15.180 --> 15:17.260\n I don't have a security clearance.\n\n15:17.260 --> 15:21.380\n You know, I am going to release whatever theory I have.\n\n15:21.380 --> 15:23.940\n And my guess is that there is zero interest\n\n15:23.940 --> 15:25.200\n from our own government.\n\n15:26.620 --> 15:29.580\n And so the Chinese will find out about it at the same time,\n\n15:29.580 --> 15:30.660\n our government does,\n\n15:30.660 --> 15:33.260\n because Lord knows what they do in these buildings.\n\n15:33.260 --> 15:36.480\n I watch crazy people walk in and out\n\n15:36.480 --> 15:39.980\n of the intelligence community, walk in and out of DARPA.\n\n15:39.980 --> 15:43.100\n And I think, wow, you're talking to that person?\n\n15:43.100 --> 15:45.220\n That's really fascinating to me.\n\n15:45.220 --> 15:48.980\n We don't seem to have a clue as to who might have the ball.\n\n15:48.980 --> 15:50.520\n Complete lack of transparency.\n\n15:50.520 --> 15:52.020\n Do you think it's possible there's,\n\n15:52.020 --> 15:54.460\n the government is in possession\n\n15:54.460 --> 15:57.060\n of something deeply fundamental\n\n15:57.060 --> 15:58.500\n to our understanding of the world\n\n15:58.500 --> 16:00.620\n that they're not releasing?\n\n16:00.620 --> 16:02.460\n So this is one of the things is,\n\n16:02.460 --> 16:05.540\n this is one of the famous distractions\n\n16:05.540 --> 16:06.980\n that people play with, the narrative.\n\n16:06.980 --> 16:08.180\n Assume that that were true.\n\n16:08.180 --> 16:12.740\n Of alien life forms and spacecraft in possession,\n\n16:12.740 --> 16:15.060\n that the government is in possession of alien spacecraft.\n\n16:15.060 --> 16:17.580\n Assume that were true.\n\n16:17.580 --> 16:21.260\n I don't think the government really exists at the moment.\n\n16:21.260 --> 16:24.660\n I believe, and this is not an idea that was original to me.\n\n16:24.660 --> 16:26.620\n There was a guy named Michael Teitelbaum\n\n16:26.620 --> 16:28.420\n who used to be at the Sloan Foundation.\n\n16:28.420 --> 16:31.300\n And at some point I pointed out that the US government\n\n16:31.300 --> 16:33.700\n had completely contradictory objectives\n\n16:33.700 --> 16:36.220\n when it came to the military and science.\n\n16:36.220 --> 16:38.660\n And one branch said this, one branch said that.\n\n16:38.660 --> 16:40.820\n I said, I don't understand which is true.\n\n16:40.820 --> 16:41.660\n What does the government want?\n\n16:41.660 --> 16:43.700\n He said, do you think there's a government?\n\n16:43.700 --> 16:45.340\n And I said, what do you mean?\n\n16:45.340 --> 16:47.740\n He said, what makes you think that the people\n\n16:47.740 --> 16:50.340\n in those two offices have ever coordinated?\n\n16:51.820 --> 16:54.300\n What is it that allows each office\n\n16:54.300 --> 16:57.740\n to have a coherent plan with respect to every other office?\n\n16:57.740 --> 16:59.580\n And that's when I first started to understand\n\n16:59.580 --> 17:02.500\n that there are periods where the government coheres,\n\n17:02.500 --> 17:04.940\n and then there are periods where the coherence just decays.\n\n17:04.940 --> 17:07.940\n And I think that that's been going on since 1945.\n\n17:07.940 --> 17:09.500\n That there have been a few places\n\n17:09.500 --> 17:10.900\n where there's been increased coherence,\n\n17:10.900 --> 17:12.580\n but in general everything is just getting\n\n17:12.580 --> 17:13.940\n less and less coherent.\n\n17:13.940 --> 17:17.180\n And that what war did was focus us on the need\n\n17:17.180 --> 17:19.180\n to have a government of people, a mission,\n\n17:20.100 --> 17:23.820\n capacity, technology, commitment, ideology.\n\n17:23.820 --> 17:26.260\n And then as soon as that was gone,\n\n17:27.780 --> 17:30.260\n different people, those who'd been through World War II\n\n17:30.260 --> 17:32.900\n had one set of beliefs, those born in the 1950s\n\n17:34.500 --> 17:36.940\n or late 40s by the time they got to Woodstock,\n\n17:38.020 --> 17:39.660\n they didn't buy any of that.\n\n17:39.660 --> 17:42.780\n So coherence is the complete opposite\n\n17:42.780 --> 17:47.780\n of bureaucracy being paralyzed by bureaucracy.\n\n17:48.500 --> 17:52.500\n So coherence is efficient, functional government.\n\n17:52.500 --> 17:54.300\n Because when you say there's no government,\n\n17:54.300 --> 17:58.540\n meaning there's no emergent function\n\n17:58.540 --> 18:00.100\n from a collection of individuals.\n\n18:00.100 --> 18:03.540\n It's just a bunch of individuals stuck in their offices\n\n18:03.540 --> 18:05.420\n without any kind of efficient communication\n\n18:05.420 --> 18:07.420\n with each other on a single mission.\n\n18:07.420 --> 18:12.420\n And so a government that is truly at the epitome\n\n18:12.620 --> 18:14.140\n of what a government is supposed to be\n\n18:14.140 --> 18:16.180\n is when a bunch of people working together.\n\n18:16.180 --> 18:17.020\n What are we about?\n\n18:17.020 --> 18:17.860\n Are we about freedom?\n\n18:17.860 --> 18:19.380\n Are we about growth?\n\n18:19.380 --> 18:22.420\n Are we about decency and fairness?\n\n18:22.420 --> 18:24.940\n Are we about the absence of a national culture\n\n18:24.940 --> 18:26.980\n so that we can all just do our own thing?\n\n18:26.980 --> 18:29.620\n I've called this thing the USA and the United States\n\n18:29.620 --> 18:31.580\n have absolutely nothing.\n\n18:31.580 --> 18:35.580\n These are all different visions for our country.\n\n18:35.580 --> 18:39.540\n So it's possible that there's a alien spacecraft somewhere\n\n18:39.540 --> 18:42.860\n and there's like 20 people that know about it.\n\n18:42.860 --> 18:44.460\n And then they're kind of like,\n\n18:44.460 --> 18:47.180\n as you communicate further and further into the offices,\n\n18:47.180 --> 18:48.580\n that information dissipates,\n\n18:48.580 --> 18:50.340\n it gets distorted in some kind of way.\n\n18:50.340 --> 18:52.500\n And then it's completely lost the power,\n\n18:52.500 --> 18:54.700\n the possibility of that information is lost.\n\n18:55.780 --> 18:57.780\n We bought a house and I had this idea\n\n18:57.780 --> 19:00.260\n that I wanted to find out what all the switches did.\n\n19:00.260 --> 19:03.220\n And I quickly found out that your house\n\n19:03.220 --> 19:05.700\n doesn't keep updating its plans.\n\n19:05.700 --> 19:07.380\n As people do modifications,\n\n19:07.380 --> 19:08.820\n they just do the modifications\n\n19:08.820 --> 19:10.380\n and they don't actually record\n\n19:10.380 --> 19:11.820\n why they were doing what they were doing\n\n19:11.820 --> 19:12.820\n or what things lead to.\n\n19:12.820 --> 19:14.860\n So there are all sorts of bizarre,\n\n19:14.860 --> 19:17.420\n like there's a switch in my house that says privacy.\n\n19:17.420 --> 19:20.220\n I don't know what privacy is.\n\n19:20.220 --> 19:22.300\n Does it turn on an electromagnetic field?\n\n19:22.300 --> 19:25.740\n Does some lead shielding go over the house?\n\n19:27.540 --> 19:28.580\n That's what we have.\n\n19:28.580 --> 19:30.180\n We have a system in which the people\n\n19:30.180 --> 19:32.500\n who've inherited these structures have no idea\n\n19:32.500 --> 19:34.140\n why their grandparents built them.\n\n19:34.140 --> 19:37.020\n I'd be funny if there's a freedom of speech switch\n\n19:37.020 --> 19:38.700\n that you could also control.\n\n19:38.700 --> 19:39.900\n And there'd be a perfect metaphor.\n\n19:39.900 --> 19:42.900\n Well, that's different because what they figured out is,\n\n19:42.900 --> 19:44.500\n is that if they can just make sure\n\n19:44.500 --> 19:48.900\n that we don't have any public options for communication,\n\n19:48.900 --> 19:52.660\n then hey, everything that we say to each other\n\n19:52.660 --> 19:53.740\n goes through a private company,\n\n19:53.740 --> 19:55.380\n private companies can do whatever they want.\n\n19:55.380 --> 19:57.620\n And this is like one of the greatest moves\n\n19:57.620 --> 19:59.140\n that we didn't really notice.\n\n20:00.260 --> 20:01.940\n Electronic and digital speech\n\n20:01.940 --> 20:04.220\n makes every other kind of speech irrelevant.\n\n20:04.220 --> 20:08.540\n And because there is no public option, guess what?\n\n20:08.540 --> 20:12.940\n There's always somebody named Sundar or Jack or Mark\n\n20:12.940 --> 20:15.260\n who controls whether or not you can speak\n\n20:15.260 --> 20:17.740\n and what it appears to be that is being said\n\n20:17.740 --> 20:20.420\n and whose stuff is weighted more highly than others.\n\n20:20.420 --> 20:22.180\n It's an absolute nightmare.\n\n20:22.180 --> 20:26.660\n And by the way, the Silicon Valley intellectual elite,\n\n20:26.660 --> 20:28.180\n Lord knows what is going on.\n\n20:28.180 --> 20:30.700\n People are so busy making money\n\n20:30.700 --> 20:34.260\n that they are not actually upholding any of the values.\n\n20:34.260 --> 20:36.660\n So Silicon Valley is sort of maximally against,\n\n20:36.660 --> 20:41.660\n it has this kind of libertarian, free, progressive sheen\n\n20:42.900 --> 20:44.380\n to it when it goes to Burning Man.\n\n20:44.380 --> 20:46.500\n And then it quickly just imposes rules\n\n20:46.500 --> 20:48.420\n on all of the rest of us as to what we could say\n\n20:48.420 --> 20:51.060\n to each other if we're not part of the inner elite.\n\n20:51.060 --> 20:53.260\n So what do you think the ideal\n\n20:53.260 --> 20:55.540\n of the freedom of speech means?\n\n20:55.540 --> 20:57.300\n Well, this is very interesting.\n\n20:57.300 --> 20:59.380\n I keep getting lectured on social media\n\n20:59.380 --> 21:01.620\n by people who have no idea how much power\n\n21:01.620 --> 21:04.580\n the Supreme Court has to abstract things.\n\n21:04.580 --> 21:07.940\n Right now, you have the concept of the letter of the law\n\n21:07.940 --> 21:09.260\n and the spirit of the law.\n\n21:09.260 --> 21:12.220\n And the spirit of the law would have to say\n\n21:12.220 --> 21:14.660\n that our speech that matters is free,\n\n21:14.660 --> 21:16.180\n at least at the level of ideas.\n\n21:16.180 --> 21:17.860\n I don't claim that I have the right\n\n21:17.860 --> 21:19.660\n to endanger your life with speech\n\n21:19.660 --> 21:22.020\n or to reveal your private information.\n\n21:22.020 --> 21:25.820\n So I really am not opining about directed speech\n\n21:25.820 --> 21:27.260\n intended to smear you.\n\n21:27.260 --> 21:30.020\n And that's a different kettle of fish.\n\n21:30.020 --> 21:31.540\n And maybe I have some rights to do that,\n\n21:31.540 --> 21:33.380\n but I don't think that they're infinite.\n\n21:34.740 --> 21:38.420\n What I am saying is that the freedom of speech for ideas\n\n21:41.020 --> 21:43.900\n is essential that the court abstract it\n\n21:43.900 --> 21:48.140\n and shove it down the throat of Google, Facebook, Twitter,\n\n21:48.140 --> 21:52.580\n Amazon, whoever these infrastructure companies are\n\n21:52.580 --> 21:56.220\n because it really matters which abstraction you use.\n\n21:56.220 --> 21:59.620\n The case that I really like is search and seizure.\n\n21:59.620 --> 22:02.700\n If I have private data that I entered in my house\n\n22:02.700 --> 22:06.220\n that is stored on a server that you hold outside of my house,\n\n22:07.380 --> 22:09.980\n but I view is the abstraction\n\n22:09.980 --> 22:12.100\n that it's only the perimeter of my house\n\n22:12.100 --> 22:13.540\n that I have the right to protect,\n\n22:13.540 --> 22:18.540\n or does my password extend the perimeter of my house\n\n22:18.740 --> 22:20.220\n to the data on the server\n\n22:20.220 --> 22:22.940\n that is located outside of my house?\n\n22:22.940 --> 22:26.740\n These are choices for the court, and the court is supposed\n\n22:26.740 --> 22:29.420\n to pretend that they can divine the true intent\n\n22:29.420 --> 22:30.660\n of the framers.\n\n22:30.660 --> 22:33.620\n But all of the sort of, and I've taken to calling this\n\n22:33.620 --> 22:35.220\n the problem of internet hyenas,\n\n22:35.220 --> 22:37.900\n people with readymade answers and LOLs,\n\n22:37.900 --> 22:39.940\n and you're such a moron.\n\n22:39.940 --> 22:42.700\n These folks love to remind you, it's a private company,\n\n22:42.700 --> 22:44.580\n dude, it can do whatever it wants.\n\n22:44.580 --> 22:48.540\n No, the court has to figure out what the abstractions are.\n\n22:48.540 --> 22:50.620\n And just the way, for example,\n\n22:50.620 --> 22:54.300\n the Griswold decision found that there was a penumbra\n\n22:54.300 --> 22:56.420\n because there was too little in the Constitution,\n\n22:56.420 --> 22:58.380\n therefore there were all sorts of things implied\n\n22:58.380 --> 23:00.820\n that couldn't be in the document.\n\n23:00.820 --> 23:04.260\n Somebody needs to come up with the abstraction right now\n\n23:04.260 --> 23:09.020\n that says Jack cannot do it if he wants.\n\n23:09.020 --> 23:11.460\n It's really, so you say the courts,\n\n23:11.460 --> 23:15.060\n but it's also us, people who think about the world,\n\n23:15.060 --> 23:16.100\n it's you. No, no, no.\n\n23:16.100 --> 23:17.220\n It's the courts.\n\n23:17.220 --> 23:19.620\n But the courts don't do this.\n\n23:19.620 --> 23:20.660\n We're toast.\n\n23:20.660 --> 23:22.420\n But we can still think about it.\n\n23:22.420 --> 23:23.500\n I mean, I'll...\n\n23:23.500 --> 23:25.740\n Sure, but I don't feel like going down the drain.\n\n23:25.740 --> 23:26.900\n Here's what I'm thinking about,\n\n23:26.900 --> 23:29.820\n because it's tricky how far it should extend.\n\n23:29.820 --> 23:31.500\n I mean, that's an ongoing conversation.\n\n23:31.500 --> 23:34.300\n Don't you think the interpretation of the law...\n\n23:34.300 --> 23:36.300\n I think I'm trying to say something very simple,\n\n23:36.300 --> 23:38.840\n and it's just not gonna be popular for a while.\n\n23:41.220 --> 23:45.100\n Tech dwarfs previous forms of communication.\n\n23:46.060 --> 23:48.220\n Print or shouting in a public park.\n\n23:48.220 --> 23:51.300\n And so I can go to a public park\n\n23:51.300 --> 23:53.020\n and I can shout if I get a permit.\n\n23:53.020 --> 23:56.380\n Even there, I think it was in the late 1980s in Atlanta,\n\n23:56.380 --> 23:58.220\n we came up with free speech zones\n\n23:58.220 --> 23:59.980\n where you can't protest at a convention.\n\n23:59.980 --> 24:02.420\n You bet you can go to a park 23 miles out\n\n24:02.420 --> 24:04.300\n and they'll fence off a little area\n\n24:04.300 --> 24:06.100\n where you can have your free speech.\n\n24:07.300 --> 24:09.140\n No, speech is dangerous.\n\n24:09.140 --> 24:10.460\n Ideas are dangerous.\n\n24:10.460 --> 24:13.740\n We are a country about danger and risk.\n\n24:13.740 --> 24:17.100\n And yes, I agree that targeted speech at individuals\n\n24:17.100 --> 24:19.420\n trying to reveal their private stuff\n\n24:19.420 --> 24:20.260\n and all that kind of...\n\n24:20.260 --> 24:21.180\n That is very different.\n\n24:21.180 --> 24:24.340\n So forget a lot of that stuff.\n\n24:24.340 --> 24:27.020\n But free speech for ideas is meant to be dangerous\n\n24:28.100 --> 24:31.940\n and people will die as a result of free speech.\n\n24:31.940 --> 24:35.500\n The idea that one life is too much is preposterous.\n\n24:35.500 --> 24:36.820\n Like why did we send...\n\n24:36.820 --> 24:38.100\n If one life is preposterous,\n\n24:38.100 --> 24:39.980\n why did we send anyone to the beaches of Normandy?\n\n24:39.980 --> 24:41.580\n I just don't get this.\n\n24:41.580 --> 24:45.940\n So one thing that I was clearly bothered by,\n\n24:45.940 --> 24:48.220\n and maybe you can be my therapist as well.\n\n24:49.060 --> 24:50.740\n I thought you were mine.\n\n24:50.740 --> 24:53.980\n This is a little bit of a miscommunication\n\n24:53.980 --> 24:55.300\n on both of our parts then.\n\n24:57.060 --> 24:58.820\n Because who's paying who for this?\n\n25:00.740 --> 25:05.740\n I was really bothered by Amazon banning Parler from AWS\n\n25:06.780 --> 25:11.260\n because my assumption was that the infrastructure...\n\n25:11.260 --> 25:14.340\n I drew a distinction between AWS,\n\n25:14.340 --> 25:18.220\n the infrastructure on which competing platforms\n\n25:18.220 --> 25:23.220\n could be created is different than the actual platforms.\n\n25:24.020 --> 25:27.500\n So the standard of the ideal of freedom of speech,\n\n25:28.460 --> 25:31.900\n I, in my mind, in a shallow way perhaps,\n\n25:31.900 --> 25:35.580\n applied differently to AWS than I did to Twitter.\n\n25:36.660 --> 25:41.020\n It felt that we've created a more dangerous world,\n\n25:41.020 --> 25:46.020\n that freedoms were violated by banning Parler from AWS,\n\n25:46.140 --> 25:48.140\n which I saw as the computing infrastructure\n\n25:48.140 --> 25:50.900\n which enables the competition of tools,\n\n25:50.900 --> 25:54.940\n the competition of frameworks of communication.\n\n25:54.940 --> 25:56.580\n What do you think about this?\n\n25:56.580 --> 25:59.900\n First of all, let me give you the internet hyena answer.\n\n26:00.900 --> 26:03.780\n I don't understand, dude, just build your own Amazon.\n\n26:03.780 --> 26:04.620\n Yeah. Right?\n\n26:04.620 --> 26:07.220\n Yes. Well, so that's a very shallow statement,\n\n26:07.220 --> 26:10.580\n but it's also one that has some legitimacy.\n\n26:10.580 --> 26:12.300\n We can't completely dismiss it\n\n26:12.300 --> 26:16.620\n because there's levels to this game.\n\n26:16.620 --> 26:19.900\n Yes and no, but if you really wanted to chase that down,\n\n26:19.900 --> 26:22.380\n one of the great things about a person to person conversation\n\n26:22.380 --> 26:25.660\n as opposed to let's have 30 of our closest friends,\n\n26:25.660 --> 26:26.660\n whenever we have a conversation\n\n26:26.660 --> 26:29.100\n with 30 of our closest friends, you know what happens?\n\n26:29.100 --> 26:31.500\n It's like passing light through a prism.\n\n26:31.500 --> 26:34.340\n Every person says something interesting.\n\n26:34.340 --> 26:36.820\n And as a result, it's always muddled.\n\n26:36.820 --> 26:38.420\n Nothing ever resolves.\n\n26:38.420 --> 26:42.260\n Well, one of my conversational techniques you mentioned,\n\n26:42.260 --> 26:46.780\n you pushed back is first this childlike naivety\n\n26:46.780 --> 26:49.020\n and curiosity, but also.\n\n26:49.020 --> 26:50.180\n Real or simulated?\n\n26:50.180 --> 26:51.500\n Real, I'm afraid.\n\n26:51.500 --> 26:53.180\n I would say 80% real.\n\n26:53.180 --> 26:54.020\n All right.\n\n26:54.020 --> 26:58.060\n So in this paradigm, how could you not see this coming?\n\n26:58.060 --> 27:01.780\n I mean, I did a show with Ashley Matthews,\n\n27:01.780 --> 27:03.820\n who's the woman behind Riley Reid.\n\n27:03.820 --> 27:06.580\n And specifically about this, it was about the idea\n\n27:06.580 --> 27:10.740\n that if I move away from politics and go towards sex,\n\n27:10.740 --> 27:14.580\n I know that there's always a move to use the infrastructure\n\n27:14.580 --> 27:18.580\n to shut down sex workers.\n\n27:18.580 --> 27:21.780\n And in this case, we had Operation Choke Point\n\n27:21.780 --> 27:24.980\n under the Obama administration.\n\n27:24.980 --> 27:28.420\n We have a positive passion for people\n\n27:28.420 --> 27:30.540\n who want to solve problems,\n\n27:30.540 --> 27:31.980\n that they don't like this company,\n\n27:31.980 --> 27:32.940\n they don't like that company,\n\n27:32.940 --> 27:35.220\n payday loans would be another one.\n\n27:35.220 --> 27:37.140\n And so you have legal companies\n\n27:37.140 --> 27:39.660\n that are harassed by our financial system\n\n27:39.660 --> 27:44.260\n that you can't, as Riley Reid,\n\n27:44.260 --> 27:47.460\n Ashley couldn't get a Mailchimp account according to her,\n\n27:47.460 --> 27:49.340\n if I understand her correctly.\n\n27:49.340 --> 27:53.340\n And this idea that you charge these people higher rates\n\n27:53.340 --> 27:56.700\n because of supposed chargebacks on credit cards,\n\n27:56.700 --> 27:59.020\n even if their chargebacks are low.\n\n27:59.020 --> 28:02.780\n Yes, we have an unofficial policy of harassment.\n\n28:02.780 --> 28:05.940\n There's something about everybody who shows up at Davos,\n\n28:07.180 --> 28:09.300\n they get drunk in the Swiss Alps,\n\n28:09.300 --> 28:12.620\n and then they come back home and they coordinate,\n\n28:12.620 --> 28:15.340\n and they coordinate things like Build Back Better.\n\n28:15.340 --> 28:17.060\n We don't really understand what Build Back Better is,\n\n28:17.060 --> 28:19.340\n but my guess is that Build Back Better\n\n28:19.340 --> 28:21.780\n has to do with extremism in America.\n\n28:21.780 --> 28:24.260\n How do we shut down the Republican Party\n\n28:24.260 --> 28:26.420\n as the source of extremism?\n\n28:26.420 --> 28:28.300\n Now, I do think the Republican Party\n\n28:28.300 --> 28:29.860\n got very extreme under Trump.\n\n28:30.780 --> 28:32.500\n And I do believe that that was responsive\n\n28:32.500 --> 28:37.500\n to how extreme the Democratic Party got under Clinton first\n\n28:38.580 --> 28:42.100\n and then Obama and then Hillary.\n\n28:42.100 --> 28:44.900\n And in all of these circumstances,\n\n28:44.900 --> 28:46.460\n it's amazing how much we want\n\n28:46.460 --> 28:48.740\n to wield these things as weapons.\n\n28:48.740 --> 28:50.700\n Well, our extremism is fine\n\n28:50.700 --> 28:53.060\n because we pretend that Antifa doesn't exist\n\n28:53.060 --> 28:55.700\n and we don't report what goes on in Portland,\n\n28:55.700 --> 28:59.500\n but your extremism, my God, that's disgusting.\n\n28:59.500 --> 29:02.260\n This is the completely ridiculous place that we're in.\n\n29:02.260 --> 29:06.020\n And by the way, our friends in part\n\n29:07.060 --> 29:08.820\n are coked up on tech money,\n\n29:08.820 --> 29:12.540\n and they don't appear to hold the courage\n\n29:12.540 --> 29:14.420\n of their convictions at a political level\n\n29:14.420 --> 29:18.060\n because it's not in keeping with shareholder value.\n\n29:18.060 --> 29:21.460\n At some level, shareholder value is the ultimate shield\n\n29:21.460 --> 29:24.780\n with which everyone can cloak themselves.\n\n29:24.780 --> 29:29.780\n Well, on that point, Donald Trump was banned from Twitter,\n\n29:29.780 --> 29:32.020\n and I'm not sure it was a good financial decision\n\n29:32.020 --> 29:33.700\n for Twitter, right?\n\n29:35.340 --> 29:37.460\n Perhaps you can correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n29:37.460 --> 29:38.780\n Well, are you thinking locally,\n\n29:38.780 --> 29:43.460\n or are you thinking if Twitter refused to ban Donald Trump,\n\n29:43.460 --> 29:45.900\n what is the odds that the full force\n\n29:45.900 --> 29:47.740\n of the antitrust division might find them?\n\n29:47.740 --> 29:48.580\n I don't know.\n\n29:48.580 --> 29:49.420\n Oh, I see, I see.\n\n29:49.420 --> 29:51.260\n So there's a complicated thing.\n\n29:51.260 --> 29:55.020\n Well, look, these guys are all having a discussion\n\n29:55.020 --> 29:56.820\n in very practical terms.\n\n29:56.820 --> 29:58.980\n You can imagine the sorts of things\n\n29:58.980 --> 30:01.340\n and imagine the sorts of conversation.\n\n30:01.340 --> 30:03.740\n Jack, Mark, Zunder, we're really glad you're all here.\n\n30:03.740 --> 30:06.340\n We're all trying to sing from the same hymnal\n\n30:06.340 --> 30:08.780\n and row in the same direction.\n\n30:08.780 --> 30:09.820\n We understand free speech.\n\n30:09.820 --> 30:11.180\n We're completely committed to it,\n\n30:11.180 --> 30:13.740\n but we have to draw a line with extremism, guys.\n\n30:13.740 --> 30:17.380\n We just need to make sure that we're all on the same page.\n\n30:17.380 --> 30:19.340\n Well, they use the term violence, too,\n\n30:19.340 --> 30:21.900\n and they, I think, over apply it.\n\n30:21.900 --> 30:23.540\n So basically, anybody...\n\n30:23.540 --> 30:30.900\n I'm telling you, I say dumb things\n\n30:30.900 --> 30:34.340\n to incentivize thoughtful conversation.\n\n30:34.340 --> 30:38.660\n Well, whatever these things are, there is no trace.\n\n30:38.660 --> 30:39.740\n Like, how old are you, Lex?\n\n30:39.740 --> 30:41.260\n You're in your mid 30s?\n\n30:41.260 --> 30:43.260\n Yeah, to late 40s.\n\n30:43.260 --> 30:46.620\n Mid, late 20s to late 40s, somewhere in there.\n\n30:46.620 --> 30:47.700\n That's the demographic, yes.\n\n30:47.700 --> 30:49.380\n I do think that partially what's happened\n\n30:49.380 --> 30:52.900\n is that your group has never seen functional institutions.\n\n30:52.900 --> 30:56.620\n These institutions have been so compromised for so long.\n\n30:56.620 --> 30:59.540\n You've probably never seen an adult.\n\n30:59.540 --> 31:02.780\n Sometimes I think Elon looks like an adult.\n\n31:02.780 --> 31:05.380\n I know that he has a wild lifestyle,\n\n31:05.380 --> 31:07.860\n but I also see it looking like an adult.\n\n31:07.860 --> 31:09.340\n What does an adult look like exactly?\n\n31:09.340 --> 31:13.060\n Oh, you know, somebody who weighs things, speaks carefully,\n\n31:13.060 --> 31:17.140\n thinks about the future beyond their own lifespan.\n\n31:17.140 --> 31:21.180\n Somebody who has a pretty good idea of how to get things done,\n\n31:21.180 --> 31:23.820\n isn't wildly caught up in punitive actions,\n\n31:23.820 --> 31:26.380\n is more focused on breaking new ground\n\n31:26.380 --> 31:29.060\n than playing rent seeking games.\n\n31:29.060 --> 31:31.140\n I mean, I really had a positive...\n\n31:31.140 --> 31:34.620\n I was so completely jazzed when Elon Musk ended up\n\n31:34.620 --> 31:36.180\n as the world's richest person.\n\n31:36.180 --> 31:39.700\n He was like, well, that's interesting, back to work.\n\n31:39.700 --> 31:43.620\n It's just like, that's what an adult would do.\n\n31:43.620 --> 31:45.580\n And it just made, you know, weirdly,\n\n31:45.580 --> 31:47.260\n I said something about, isn't it amazing\n\n31:47.260 --> 31:50.460\n that the world's richest person knows what a Lagrangian is?\n\n31:50.460 --> 31:54.220\n And he made a terrible Lagrange joke about potentials.\n\n31:54.220 --> 31:57.180\n But yeah, I mean, I do think that ultimately,\n\n31:57.180 --> 32:00.100\n Elon may be one of the closest things we have to an adult.\n\n32:00.100 --> 32:02.060\n And I can tell you that the internet hyenas\n\n32:02.060 --> 32:05.020\n will immediately descend as to what a fraudster he is\n\n32:05.020 --> 32:06.340\n for pumping his stock price,\n\n32:06.340 --> 32:08.220\n talking his book and all this stuff.\n\n32:08.220 --> 32:09.500\n Shut up.\n\n32:09.500 --> 32:12.140\n Just looking at the world seriously and really saying,\n\n32:12.140 --> 32:15.900\n you're saying that the people who are running tech companies\n\n32:15.900 --> 32:20.900\n or running the mediums on which we can exercise\n\n32:21.180 --> 32:24.500\n the ideal of free speech are not adults.\n\n32:24.500 --> 32:25.340\n I think not.\n\n32:25.340 --> 32:26.580\n I think, first of all, a lot of them\n\n32:26.580 --> 32:30.620\n are Silicon Valley utopian businessmen,\n\n32:30.620 --> 32:33.660\n where you talk a utopian line and you use it.\n\n32:33.660 --> 32:37.940\n You've heard my take, which is that the idealism\n\n32:37.940 --> 32:41.180\n of every era is the cover story of its greatest thefts.\n\n32:41.180 --> 32:42.980\n And I believe that in many ways,\n\n32:42.980 --> 32:45.460\n the idealism of Silicon Valley about connecting the world,\n\n32:45.460 --> 32:47.900\n the world of abundance, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n32:47.900 --> 32:51.940\n is really about the software eating the world\n\n32:51.940 --> 32:53.340\n as Mark Andreessen likes to say,\n\n32:53.340 --> 32:55.060\n that there were all these legacy properties\n\n32:55.060 --> 32:58.740\n and by simply being a bad tech version\n\n32:58.740 --> 33:03.260\n of something that previously existed like a newspaper,\n\n33:03.260 --> 33:05.780\n you could immediately start to dwarf that\n\n33:05.780 --> 33:08.140\n by aggregating newspapers and their digital versions\n\n33:08.140 --> 33:10.460\n because digital is so much more powerful.\n\n33:10.460 --> 33:15.100\n As a result, yes, we have lots of man children\n\n33:15.100 --> 33:18.100\n wandering around what once was the Bay Area\n\n33:18.100 --> 33:20.700\n and is now Austin and Miami and other places,\n\n33:22.140 --> 33:27.140\n maybe Singapore, that all of these people,\n\n33:27.900 --> 33:29.740\n these are friends of ours and they're brilliant\n\n33:29.740 --> 33:32.380\n with respect to a certain amount of stuff,\n\n33:32.380 --> 33:34.380\n but none of them can get off the drip.\n\n33:34.380 --> 33:37.220\n It's amazing that none of them have FU money.\n\n33:37.220 --> 33:39.820\n We've got billionaires who don't have FU money.\n\n33:39.820 --> 33:43.020\n Okay, I think the argument used by Jack Dorsey\n\n33:43.020 --> 33:45.820\n was that there was an incitement of violence\n\n33:45.820 --> 33:47.100\n and not just Jack Dorsey,\n\n33:47.100 --> 33:50.180\n but everybody that was banning people.\n\n33:50.180 --> 33:52.180\n And then this word violence was used\n\n33:53.180 --> 33:56.380\n as a kind of just like extremism and so on\n\n33:56.380 --> 33:59.220\n to without much reason behind it.\n\n33:59.220 --> 34:01.660\n You think it's impossible for Jack Dorsey\n\n34:01.660 --> 34:04.780\n or anybody else to be, as you said, an adult,\n\n34:04.780 --> 34:06.220\n a grownup and reason.\n\n34:06.220 --> 34:07.940\n Well, Jack is pretty close to being a grownup.\n\n34:07.940 --> 34:08.780\n It seems like he is.\n\n34:08.780 --> 34:11.580\n Yeah, but he's under pressures.\n\n34:11.580 --> 34:13.300\n As you've discussed,\n\n34:13.300 --> 34:15.740\n it seems that he's been on the verge\n\n34:15.740 --> 34:18.940\n of almost being quite serious and transparent\n\n34:18.940 --> 34:19.780\n and real with people.\n\n34:19.780 --> 34:22.300\n I don't know where the Jack Dorsey that I met went.\n\n34:23.140 --> 34:27.380\n And I worry that that must be something behind the scenes\n\n34:27.380 --> 34:28.260\n that I can't see.\n\n34:29.140 --> 34:32.700\n From my perspective, what I think is the stress,\n\n34:32.700 --> 34:36.540\n the burden of that when people are screaming at you\n\n34:37.380 --> 34:38.220\n is overwhelming.\n\n34:38.220 --> 34:39.580\n No, Jack is a Zen monk.\n\n34:39.580 --> 34:41.660\n He really is.\n\n34:41.660 --> 34:42.820\n Yeah.\n\n34:42.820 --> 34:47.700\n Jack is an incredibly impressive person intellectually,\n\n34:47.700 --> 34:52.700\n morally, spiritually, at least for a couple of meetings.\n\n34:52.740 --> 34:54.140\n I don't know him very well,\n\n34:54.140 --> 34:57.740\n but I'm very impressed by the person I met\n\n34:57.740 --> 34:59.220\n and I don't know where that person is.\n\n34:59.220 --> 35:00.460\n And that terrifies me.\n\n35:02.020 --> 35:04.540\n But do you think somebody could step up in that way?\n\n35:04.540 --> 35:05.740\n No.\n\n35:05.740 --> 35:10.740\n So does a human being have the capacity to be transparent\n\n35:11.860 --> 35:14.220\n about the reasoning behind the banning?\n\n35:14.220 --> 35:19.220\n Or do you think all banning of people\n\n35:19.460 --> 35:24.140\n from mediums of communication is eventually destructive\n\n35:24.140 --> 35:25.980\n or it's impossible for human beings\n\n35:25.980 --> 35:27.980\n to reason with ourselves about it?\n\n35:27.980 --> 35:30.980\n Well, let's see what the problem is.\n\n35:30.980 --> 35:33.380\n So my phone has been on airplane mode.\n\n35:33.380 --> 35:34.420\n I'm gonna unlock it.\n\n35:34.420 --> 35:38.420\n And I'm gonna take a picture of Lex Fridman.\n\n35:38.420 --> 35:43.300\n Now, if I can, I'm gonna tweet that picture out.\n\n35:43.300 --> 35:44.140\n Great.\n\n35:44.140 --> 35:45.300\n But here's the weird part about it.\n\n35:45.300 --> 35:46.780\n Yeah.\n\n35:46.780 --> 35:51.780\n That picture sitting with Lex today.\n\n35:55.940 --> 35:58.620\n This, ladies and gentlemen, is how the sausage is made.\n\n35:58.620 --> 35:59.460\n Okay.\n\n35:59.460 --> 36:04.460\n In so doing, I have just sent a picture of you\n\n36:07.140 --> 36:10.540\n and a tiny piece of text all over the planet\n\n36:10.540 --> 36:15.100\n that has arrived at, if statistics tell the truth,\n\n36:15.100 --> 36:17.500\n just under half a million different accounts.\n\n36:19.260 --> 36:22.220\n And then more from sharing and so on.\n\n36:22.220 --> 36:23.980\n Well, and then some of those accounts are dead.\n\n36:23.980 --> 36:26.140\n We don't really know how many places it went.\n\n36:26.140 --> 36:28.820\n But the key issue with that tweet\n\n36:28.820 --> 36:32.820\n is that that is a nonlocal phenomenon.\n\n36:33.700 --> 36:34.540\n Yes.\n\n36:34.540 --> 36:39.540\n So I just broadcasted to an entire planet.\n\n36:39.540 --> 36:41.620\n Somebody in Uganda is reading that\n\n36:41.620 --> 36:43.620\n at the same time as somebody in Uruguay.\n\n36:45.020 --> 36:50.020\n There is no known solution to have so many people\n\n36:50.820 --> 36:54.140\n with the ability to communicate nonlocally\n\n36:54.140 --> 36:58.500\n because locality was part of the implicit nature of speech\n\n36:58.500 --> 36:59.860\n inside of the constitution.\n\n36:59.860 --> 37:01.900\n Friction, locality, there were all sorts\n\n37:01.900 --> 37:04.140\n of other aspects to speech.\n\n37:04.140 --> 37:06.140\n So if you think about speech as a bundle.\n\n37:08.900 --> 37:09.740\n I like this.\n\n37:10.700 --> 37:11.940\n Then it got unbundled.\n\n37:12.820 --> 37:17.020\n And some of those aspects that we were naturally counting on\n\n37:17.020 --> 37:22.020\n to retard the impact of speech aren't present.\n\n37:22.180 --> 37:23.980\n And we don't have the courage to say,\n\n37:23.980 --> 37:26.940\n I wonder if the first amendment really applies\n\n37:26.940 --> 37:28.860\n in the modern era in the same way,\n\n37:28.860 --> 37:30.780\n or we have to work through an abstraction.\n\n37:30.780 --> 37:33.100\n Either we probably have to amend the constitution\n\n37:33.100 --> 37:34.860\n or we have to abstract it properly.\n\n37:35.820 --> 37:40.580\n And that issue is not something we're facing up to.\n\n37:40.580 --> 37:44.820\n I watch us constantly look backwards.\n\n37:46.300 --> 37:48.820\n We don't seem to try to come up with new ideas\n\n37:48.820 --> 37:49.660\n and new theories.\n\n37:49.660 --> 37:52.340\n Nobody really imagines that we're going to be able\n\n37:52.340 --> 37:54.780\n to wisely amend the constitution anymore\n\n37:54.780 --> 37:56.220\n in the inside of the United States.\n\n37:56.220 --> 37:57.780\n Many people abroad will say,\n\n37:57.780 --> 37:59.420\n why are these guys talking about the US?\n\n37:59.420 --> 38:01.140\n It's a US centric program.\n\n38:01.140 --> 38:03.940\n Well, it's because nobody knows where this program lives.\n\n38:05.020 --> 38:06.900\n The fact, by the way, that you and I happen to be\n\n38:06.900 --> 38:10.220\n in a physical place together is also bizarre.\n\n38:10.220 --> 38:11.060\n It could be anywhere.\n\n38:11.060 --> 38:13.780\n It doesn't really matter that it happens to be here.\n\n38:13.780 --> 38:16.140\n So the difference between logical and between physical,\n\n38:16.140 --> 38:18.860\n local, nonlocal, frictional, nonfrictional,\n\n38:18.860 --> 38:21.540\n it's the same thing with firearms.\n\n38:21.540 --> 38:25.660\n Nobody imagined that the Gatling gun\n\n38:25.660 --> 38:28.300\n was gonna be present when you had to reload a musket.\n\n38:29.460 --> 38:33.460\n And that's fascinating to think about.\n\n38:33.460 --> 38:37.220\n I mean, you're exactly right that the nature\n\n38:37.220 --> 38:39.860\n of this particular freedom that seems so foundational\n\n38:39.860 --> 38:44.260\n to this nation, to what made this nation great\n\n38:44.260 --> 38:46.460\n and perhaps much of the world that is great,\n\n38:46.460 --> 38:49.460\n made it great, is changing completely.\n\n38:49.460 --> 38:52.060\n Can we try to reason through how the ideal freedom\n\n38:52.060 --> 38:54.220\n of speech is to be changed?\n\n38:54.220 --> 38:57.620\n I mean, I guess I'm struggling.\n\n38:57.620 --> 39:00.860\n It feels really wrong, perhaps because I wasn't\n\n39:00.860 --> 39:01.820\n paying attention to it.\n\n39:01.820 --> 39:06.820\n It feels really wrong to ban Donald Trump from Twitter,\n\n39:06.900 --> 39:08.700\n to ban not just the president.\n\n39:08.700 --> 39:10.900\n That's really wrong to me.\n\n39:10.900 --> 39:15.540\n But this particular human for being divisive.\n\n39:15.540 --> 39:20.140\n But then when there's an incitement of violence,\n\n39:20.140 --> 39:23.500\n that is an overused claim.\n\n39:23.500 --> 39:28.500\n But perhaps there was actual brewing\n\n39:29.500 --> 39:31.620\n of local violence happening.\n\n39:31.620 --> 39:34.220\n So one of the things I know was happening on Parler\n\n39:34.220 --> 39:39.220\n is people were scheduling meetings together\n\n39:39.340 --> 39:40.380\n in physical space.\n\n39:40.380 --> 39:45.380\n So you're now going back from this dynamic, social,\n\n39:46.100 --> 39:48.860\n large scale, people from Uganda, people from all\n\n39:48.860 --> 39:51.340\n over the world being able to communicate.\n\n39:51.340 --> 39:54.020\n You're now mapping that into now back meeting\n\n39:54.020 --> 39:57.300\n in the physical space that is similar\n\n39:57.300 --> 39:58.780\n to what the founding of this nation was.\n\n39:58.780 --> 40:00.620\n The violence would be digital\n\n40:00.620 --> 40:03.520\n if ransomware suddenly was unleashed.\n\n40:04.720 --> 40:05.560\n True.\n\n40:05.560 --> 40:07.360\n The key issue is the abstractions.\n\n40:07.360 --> 40:10.740\n So what was freedom of speech as a bundle?\n\n40:10.740 --> 40:12.020\n And now it's...\n\n40:12.020 --> 40:14.540\n And then how do we abstract the bundle\n\n40:14.540 --> 40:16.680\n into the digital era?\n\n40:16.680 --> 40:18.500\n Do you think we just need to raise the question\n\n40:18.500 --> 40:19.340\n and talk about it?\n\n40:19.340 --> 40:20.580\n Do you have ideas?\n\n40:20.580 --> 40:21.720\n Well, sure I have ideas.\n\n40:21.720 --> 40:24.260\n But the key point is that I'm not even welcome\n\n40:24.260 --> 40:25.480\n in mainstream media.\n\n40:26.700 --> 40:28.400\n I've never seen you on mainstream media.\n\n40:28.400 --> 40:29.600\n Do you do mainstream media?\n\n40:29.600 --> 40:32.500\n So we exist in part of an alternate universe\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:35.020\n because the mainstream media is trying to have\n\n40:35.020 --> 40:37.740\n a coherent story, which I've called\n\n40:37.740 --> 40:39.500\n the gated institutional narrative.\n\n40:39.500 --> 40:41.340\n And the institutions pretend that,\n\n40:41.340 --> 40:43.460\n they plug their fingers in their ears\n\n40:43.460 --> 40:46.140\n and pretend that nothing exists outside\n\n40:46.140 --> 40:49.400\n of MSNBC talking to CNN about what was\n\n40:49.400 --> 40:52.860\n in the New York Times as covered by the Washington Post.\n\n40:52.860 --> 40:54.980\n And so that's effectively like a professional\n\n40:54.980 --> 40:57.180\n wrestling promotion where they, you know,\n\n40:57.180 --> 40:59.820\n the Undertaker faces off against Hulk Hogan\n\n40:59.820 --> 41:01.800\n and Rowdy Roddy Piper.\n\n41:01.800 --> 41:05.900\n Okay, well, that's very different than MMA.\n\n41:05.900 --> 41:08.740\n You've recently been on Glenn Beck's program.\n\n41:08.740 --> 41:09.740\n Yeah.\n\n41:09.740 --> 41:12.860\n And there was this kind of, one of the things\n\n41:12.860 --> 41:15.520\n you've talked about is being able to have\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:19.260\n this conversation, I don't know if you would put it\n\n41:19.260 --> 41:21.280\n as a type of conversation that was happening\n\n41:21.280 --> 41:23.740\n outside the mainstream media, but a conversation\n\n41:23.740 --> 41:27.780\n that reaches across different world views.\n\n41:27.780 --> 41:28.620\n You're right.\n\n41:28.620 --> 41:33.300\n Being a nuanced, or just like a respectful conversation\n\n41:33.300 --> 41:35.220\n that's grounded in mutual.\n\n41:35.220 --> 41:37.900\n But we can't have the reality because the main model\n\n41:37.900 --> 41:42.220\n is the center, both left and right,\n\n41:42.220 --> 41:44.300\n is in the process of stealing all the wealth\n\n41:44.300 --> 41:45.240\n that we built up.\n\n41:46.260 --> 41:50.240\n And they've organized the extremes into two LARPing teams\n\n41:50.240 --> 41:53.140\n that I've called Magistan and Wokistan.\n\n41:53.140 --> 41:55.880\n And then you have everybody who isn't part\n\n41:55.880 --> 41:58.260\n of that complex, all seven of us.\n\n41:58.260 --> 42:00.780\n The number of us who are able to earn a living\n\n42:00.780 --> 42:04.380\n looking at all of these mad people playing this game.\n\n42:05.820 --> 42:09.500\n There's a phrase inside finance when the investment banks\n\n42:09.500 --> 42:12.540\n are trying to look at price action.\n\n42:12.540 --> 42:14.900\n And somebody says, this doesn't make any sense.\n\n42:14.900 --> 42:16.340\n And somebody will say, it's just the locals\n\n42:16.340 --> 42:17.780\n stealing from each other.\n\n42:17.780 --> 42:20.020\n And that's really what we have.\n\n42:20.020 --> 42:22.800\n We've got the leaders of Magistan and Wokistan,\n\n42:23.920 --> 42:27.020\n championing these two teams is sponsored by the center\n\n42:27.020 --> 42:29.340\n because it's a distraction while they steal all the silver\n\n42:29.340 --> 42:31.460\n and cut the paintings out of the frames.\n\n42:31.460 --> 42:33.660\n That's what you and I are looking at.\n\n42:33.660 --> 42:35.460\n So when you ask me, do you have any ideas\n\n42:35.460 --> 42:37.320\n about the abstraction for free speech?\n\n42:39.140 --> 42:41.260\n I've never met Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n42:41.260 --> 42:43.260\n I've never met Sundar Pichai.\n\n42:43.260 --> 42:45.140\n I never met Larry Page.\n\n42:45.140 --> 42:47.500\n I was once in a room with Sergey Brin.\n\n42:47.500 --> 42:49.640\n I've never spoken to Elon Musk.\n\n42:50.820 --> 42:52.180\n I hang out with Peter Thiel,\n\n42:52.180 --> 42:54.440\n but we have a very deep relationship,\n\n42:54.440 --> 42:58.180\n but I don't really speak to that many other people\n\n42:58.180 --> 43:00.420\n at sort of at this level.\n\n43:00.420 --> 43:04.220\n We're not having any kind of smart conversation\n\n43:04.220 --> 43:05.540\n at a national level.\n\n43:05.540 --> 43:10.540\n In fact, it's almost as if we've destroyed every sandbox\n\n43:11.500 --> 43:13.300\n in which we could play together.\n\n43:13.300 --> 43:15.740\n There's no place that we actually talk\n\n43:15.740 --> 43:18.180\n except long form podcasting.\n\n43:18.180 --> 43:20.300\n And by the way, they've found,\n\n43:20.300 --> 43:23.220\n you see what's going on with like Alex Stamos\n\n43:23.220 --> 43:25.260\n and the Hoover Institution.\n\n43:26.700 --> 43:28.160\n There's a loophole left.\n\n43:28.160 --> 43:31.700\n Long form podcasting allows people to speak\n\n43:31.700 --> 43:34.260\n at levels above daytime CNN.\n\n43:34.260 --> 43:35.940\n It's like, well, why do you think\n\n43:35.940 --> 43:37.720\n they're not watching daytime CNN?\n\n43:39.020 --> 43:42.260\n But that's just silly journalism.\n\n43:42.260 --> 43:45.940\n They currently have no power to displace podcasting.\n\n43:45.940 --> 43:47.780\n That's why it's so powerful, RSS feed.\n\n43:47.780 --> 43:50.320\n I mean, that's why the big challenge with Joe Rogan\n\n43:50.320 --> 43:53.500\n and Spotify is like, there's this dance that's fascinating\n\n43:53.500 --> 43:57.980\n to see is Joe Rogan is not part of the system\n\n43:57.980 --> 44:00.660\n and then he's also uncancellable\n\n44:00.660 --> 44:03.580\n and there's this tension that's happening.\n\n44:03.580 --> 44:04.420\n It's fascinating.\n\n44:04.420 --> 44:05.420\n Well, think about what happened to Howard Stern though.\n\n44:05.420 --> 44:07.640\n Howard Stern became much less relevant.\n\n44:08.900 --> 44:13.240\n So if they can't control Joe by bringing him in house,\n\n44:13.240 --> 44:17.500\n the key question is, is he going to continue,\n\n44:17.500 --> 44:20.820\n like Joe says this thing about FU money.\n\n44:22.220 --> 44:24.380\n Joe's one of the only people with FU money\n\n44:24.380 --> 44:26.160\n who's actually said FU.\n\n44:28.740 --> 44:30.560\n I don't understand this.\n\n44:30.560 --> 44:32.100\n I don't have FU money.\n\n44:32.100 --> 44:36.420\n What exactly is, can we break apart FU money?\n\n44:36.420 --> 44:40.420\n Because I always thought I've been fortunate enough\n\n44:41.420 --> 44:45.020\n to always have FU money in the sense\n\n44:45.020 --> 44:48.260\n that my standards were so low that a basic salary\n\n44:48.260 --> 44:49.100\n in the United States.\n\n44:49.100 --> 44:50.300\n Well, this is the stoic point,\n\n44:50.300 --> 44:53.020\n which is if you can live on rice and beans,\n\n44:53.020 --> 44:54.980\n you're uncancellable because you're always rich\n\n44:54.980 --> 44:56.220\n relative to your needs.\n\n44:56.220 --> 44:57.940\n Isn't that FU fundamental, FU money?\n\n44:57.940 --> 45:01.540\n Why do you say that tech billionaires don't have FU money?\n\n45:01.540 --> 45:03.600\n When you need to hire private security\n\n45:03.600 --> 45:05.080\n to protect your family,\n\n45:05.080 --> 45:07.020\n how do you protect your two children?\n\n45:07.020 --> 45:08.060\n I don't have those yet.\n\n45:08.060 --> 45:09.060\n Bingo.\n\n45:09.060 --> 45:10.140\n Yeah.\n\n45:10.140 --> 45:14.540\n My point is that FU money insulates everything\n\n45:14.540 --> 45:15.500\n that you care about.\n\n45:15.500 --> 45:17.380\n It's not just about you.\n\n45:17.380 --> 45:20.940\n So you're saying as the level of responsibility grows,\n\n45:20.940 --> 45:24.600\n the amount of money required for FU.\n\n45:24.600 --> 45:26.060\n We have a war going on.\n\n45:26.060 --> 45:28.660\n The war is on academic freedom.\n\n45:28.660 --> 45:31.540\n Academic freedom used to be present in the system\n\n45:31.540 --> 45:35.820\n as a, in terms of the idea, we trust our elite.\n\n45:35.820 --> 45:39.420\n Now we have an idea like, you wanna be the elite.\n\n45:39.420 --> 45:40.980\n You want a Lord above us.\n\n45:40.980 --> 45:43.940\n First of all, there's like a populist, anti elitist thing.\n\n45:43.940 --> 45:44.900\n Then there's the idea\n\n45:44.900 --> 45:48.620\n that we're gonna defer tenure for forever.\n\n45:48.620 --> 45:50.220\n Then we're gonna tell people, stay in your lane.\n\n45:50.220 --> 45:51.400\n Your tenure is only good\n\n45:51.400 --> 45:54.700\n for your own particular tiny micro subject.\n\n45:54.700 --> 45:56.500\n Then we're gonna also control your grants\n\n45:56.500 --> 45:59.000\n and we'll be able to load up your teaching load.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:00.140\n If we don't like who you are,\n\n46:00.140 --> 46:03.480\n we'll make your life absolutely impossible.\n\n46:03.480 --> 46:05.180\n We lost academic freedom\n\n46:06.280 --> 46:09.800\n and we ushered in peer review, which was a disaster.\n\n46:10.700 --> 46:12.820\n And then we lost funding\n\n46:12.820 --> 46:14.580\n so that people were confident\n\n46:14.580 --> 46:17.300\n that they would have the ability to do research\n\n46:17.300 --> 46:18.540\n no matter what they said.\n\n46:20.060 --> 46:21.860\n And as a result, what you find is,\n\n46:21.860 --> 46:24.700\n is a world in which there's no ability\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:26.500\n to get people to say, no, I'm not gonna sign\n\n46:26.500 --> 46:30.300\n your diversity and inclusion forced loyalty oath.\n\n46:30.300 --> 46:32.180\n I won't sign any loyalty oath.\n\n46:32.180 --> 46:33.680\n Get the hell out of my office.\n\n46:34.740 --> 46:35.580\n FU.\n\n46:36.420 --> 46:39.160\n FU, and you're connecting money to that, but.\n\n46:39.160 --> 46:41.620\n Well, my point is, is that academic freedom\n\n46:41.620 --> 46:45.420\n is the, the whole idea behind it\n\n46:45.420 --> 46:48.460\n was that you will have the freedom of a billionaire\n\n46:48.460 --> 46:50.020\n on a much smaller salary.\n\n46:50.020 --> 46:50.940\n Right.\n\n46:50.940 --> 46:51.780\n Okay.\n\n46:53.240 --> 46:54.140\n We've lost that.\n\n46:54.140 --> 46:56.340\n Yeah, the only reason in part\n\n46:56.340 --> 47:00.900\n that I wanted to go into academic,\n\n47:00.900 --> 47:02.260\n academics as a profession,\n\n47:02.260 --> 47:04.740\n as opposed to wanting to do physical\n\n47:04.740 --> 47:06.280\n or mathematical research.\n\n47:07.340 --> 47:09.580\n The great prize was freedom.\n\n47:09.580 --> 47:12.540\n And Ralph Gomery of the Sloan Foundation,\n\n47:12.540 --> 47:14.820\n previously of IBM research pointed it out.\n\n47:14.820 --> 47:17.300\n He says, if you lose freedom,\n\n47:17.300 --> 47:20.460\n you lose the only thing we had to offer top minds.\n\n47:20.460 --> 47:23.180\n Top minds value their intellectual freedom\n\n47:23.180 --> 47:26.140\n and their physical and economic security\n\n47:26.140 --> 47:29.260\n at a different level than other human beings.\n\n47:29.260 --> 47:31.140\n And so people say, you know,\n\n47:32.580 --> 47:33.420\n I don't understand, dude,\n\n47:33.420 --> 47:35.220\n and you have the ability to do X, Y, and Z.\n\n47:35.220 --> 47:36.060\n What's the problem?\n\n47:36.060 --> 47:37.900\n It's like, well, I value my ability\n\n47:37.900 --> 47:40.240\n to raise the middle finger as an American,\n\n47:41.180 --> 47:43.200\n practically above everything else.\n\n47:44.160 --> 47:46.900\n I want to talk to you about freedom here\n\n47:46.900 --> 47:49.180\n in the context of something you've mentioned,\n\n47:49.180 --> 47:52.400\n which is one way to take away freedom\n\n47:52.400 --> 47:55.860\n is to put a human being into a cage\n\n47:55.860 --> 47:57.380\n to create constraints.\n\n47:57.380 --> 47:58.660\n The other one that worries me\n\n47:58.660 --> 48:00.220\n is something that I think you've spoken to\n\n48:00.220 --> 48:03.440\n to Twitter a little bit on Twitter,\n\n48:03.440 --> 48:08.440\n is we bleed freedom by kind of slowly\n\n48:12.900 --> 48:16.620\n scaring you into not doing,\n\n48:16.620 --> 48:19.740\n not expressing the full spectrum of opportunities\n\n48:19.740 --> 48:20.580\n you can as freedom.\n\n48:20.580 --> 48:22.720\n So like when you ban Donald Trump,\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:27.360\n when you ban Parler,\n\n48:27.360 --> 48:30.180\n you give a little doubt in the minds of millions,\n\n48:30.180 --> 48:33.060\n like me, a person who's a tech person,\n\n48:33.060 --> 48:35.780\n who's an entrepreneur,\n\n48:35.780 --> 48:36.620\n there's a little,\n\n48:36.620 --> 48:38.660\n that's what I'm afraid of when I look in the mirror,\n\n48:38.660 --> 48:41.260\n is there now a little doubt in there\n\n48:41.260 --> 48:43.740\n that limits the amount of options I will try?\n\n48:43.740 --> 48:47.500\n How certain are you that the COVID virus\n\n48:47.500 --> 48:49.900\n didn't come from the Wuhan lab\n\n48:49.900 --> 48:52.140\n and is biosafety level four?\n\n48:52.140 --> 48:55.860\n We both know that we're both supposed to robotically say\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.580\n the idea that the COVID virus came from a lab\n\n48:59.580 --> 49:01.500\n is a discredited conspiracy theory.\n\n49:01.500 --> 49:03.780\n There is no evidence that suggests that this is true.\n\n49:03.780 --> 49:05.900\n The World Health Organization and the CDC\n\n49:05.900 --> 49:08.100\n have both opined this to say otherwise\n\n49:08.100 --> 49:09.660\n would be incredibly irresponsible.\n\n49:09.660 --> 49:11.900\n And the threat of that is the thing\n\n49:11.900 --> 49:16.780\n that ultimately limits the freedoms we feel.\n\n49:16.780 --> 49:19.460\n I should be tweeting about Jeff Epstein all the time.\n\n49:20.660 --> 49:22.060\n And you're afraid.\n\n49:22.060 --> 49:23.500\n It's also boring.\n\n49:23.500 --> 49:25.540\n I mean, I said it in the public.\n\n49:25.540 --> 49:26.380\n Many times.\n\n49:26.380 --> 49:28.820\n Why is it we don't ask where the records are\n\n49:28.820 --> 49:29.700\n from Villard House?\n\n49:29.700 --> 49:30.860\n Where are the financial records?\n\n49:30.860 --> 49:32.940\n Where are the SEC filings?\n\n49:32.940 --> 49:35.540\n Where are the questions on the record\n\n49:35.540 --> 49:39.220\n to the intelligence agencies?\n\n49:39.220 --> 49:42.340\n Was he known to be part of the intelligence community?\n\n49:42.340 --> 49:46.060\n So we're not interested in asking questions.\n\n49:46.060 --> 49:51.060\n Like, am I gonna die as a result of asking the question,\n\n49:51.180 --> 49:53.460\n was Jeff Epstein part of the intelligence community\n\n49:53.460 --> 49:54.980\n of any nation?\n\n49:54.980 --> 49:56.240\n Is there a reason we're not asking\n\n49:56.240 --> 49:58.480\n about the financial records of the supposed hedge fund\n\n49:58.480 --> 49:59.440\n that he didn't run?\n\n49:59.440 --> 50:02.900\n It's just like the Wuhan lab.\n\n50:02.900 --> 50:05.580\n Okay, how do we get to the core of the Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n50:05.580 --> 50:08.820\n the truth behind Jeffrey Epstein in a sense?\n\n50:08.820 --> 50:10.860\n I mean, there's some things that are just like\n\n50:10.860 --> 50:12.740\n useless conspiracy theories around it,\n\n50:12.740 --> 50:13.720\n even if they're true.\n\n50:13.720 --> 50:14.560\n There's some things that get to say it.\n\n50:14.560 --> 50:15.500\n I hate to say it.\n\n50:15.500 --> 50:17.000\n You're not gonna like it.\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:20.600\n Look at the 1971 media Pennsylvania break in\n\n50:20.600 --> 50:23.200\n of the Citizens Committee to investigate the FBI.\n\n50:24.220 --> 50:27.140\n Those kids, and by the way, they weren't all kids,\n\n50:27.140 --> 50:30.360\n did what had to be done.\n\n50:31.540 --> 50:33.760\n They broke in, they broke the law.\n\n50:33.760 --> 50:36.100\n It was an incredible act of civil disobedience.\n\n50:37.060 --> 50:40.260\n And God bless Judy Feingold for taking to her,\n\n50:40.260 --> 50:42.520\n she was going to take to her grave,\n\n50:42.520 --> 50:43.640\n that she'd been part of this,\n\n50:43.640 --> 50:45.360\n like the coolest thing of all time.\n\n50:45.360 --> 50:47.580\n They didn't say anything for forever.\n\n50:47.580 --> 50:50.180\n So civil disobedience, I mean, you have to.\n\n50:50.180 --> 50:52.300\n We are founded on civil disobedience.\n\n50:52.300 --> 50:55.000\n Civil disobedience is incredibly,\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:59.880\n you screw it up and you're just a vandal.\n\n50:59.880 --> 51:01.560\n You screw it up, you're a hooligan.\n\n51:01.560 --> 51:02.400\n Yeah.\n\n51:02.400 --> 51:06.240\n Those cats were so disciplined.\n\n51:06.240 --> 51:07.080\n It's an art form.\n\n51:07.080 --> 51:09.760\n It was an art form and they risked everything.\n\n51:09.760 --> 51:12.700\n They were willing to pay with their freedom.\n\n51:14.100 --> 51:17.400\n Those are the sorts of people who earned the right\n\n51:17.400 --> 51:18.760\n by putting themselves at risk.\n\n51:18.760 --> 51:20.940\n I would not do this.\n\n51:20.940 --> 51:24.960\n I am not volunteering to break into anything.\n\n51:24.960 --> 51:28.680\n I think it was William Davidon who was a student\n\n51:28.680 --> 51:32.080\n of Murray Gellman and a physics professor at Haverford\n\n51:32.080 --> 51:36.040\n who corralled these people and led this effort.\n\n51:36.040 --> 51:40.840\n And right now, what we need is somebody to blow the lid\n\n51:40.840 --> 51:43.120\n off of what is controlling everything.\n\n51:43.120 --> 51:47.500\n We have, I'm happy to hear that it's a system\n\n51:47.500 --> 51:48.720\n of incentive structures,\n\n51:48.720 --> 51:50.320\n that it's a system of selective pressures.\n\n51:50.320 --> 51:52.240\n I'm happy to find out that it's emergent.\n\n51:52.240 --> 51:54.040\n I'm happy to find that it's partially directed\n\n51:54.040 --> 51:56.520\n by our own intelligence community.\n\n51:56.520 --> 52:00.160\n I'm happy to hear that, in fact, we've been penetrated\n\n52:00.160 --> 52:04.080\n by North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia.\n\n52:04.080 --> 52:07.220\n But I need to know why people aren't,\n\n52:07.220 --> 52:09.960\n like the firebombing of the courthouse in Portland, Oregon\n\n52:09.960 --> 52:11.340\n has no explanation.\n\n52:12.360 --> 52:14.080\n And somehow this is normal.\n\n52:14.080 --> 52:16.320\n This is not normal to any human being.\n\n52:17.280 --> 52:19.320\n We have video that people don't believe.\n\n52:19.320 --> 52:24.320\n And I come back to the shaggy defense of it wasn't me.\n\n52:24.680 --> 52:29.680\n You know, so it's like, you remember that song?\n\n52:30.240 --> 52:33.680\n Shaggy, yeah, it wasn't me caught you banging\n\n52:33.680 --> 52:35.080\n in the shower on the counter.\n\n52:35.080 --> 52:36.760\n Yeah, exactly, it wasn't me.\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:37.600\n It wasn't me.\n\n52:37.600 --> 52:39.760\n He says, but his friend says,\n\n52:39.760 --> 52:41.880\n well, your strategy makes no sense at all.\n\n52:41.880 --> 52:44.600\n Well, this is what MSNBC is doing.\n\n52:46.120 --> 52:48.520\n You dropped it from the graphic, it wasn't me.\n\n52:48.520 --> 52:49.360\n It wasn't me.\n\n52:49.360 --> 52:51.540\n You came up with another Yang, it wasn't me.\n\n52:52.480 --> 52:55.480\n I will never see MSNBC the same again.\n\n52:55.480 --> 52:57.720\n So you've spoken about him before.\n\n52:57.720 --> 53:00.520\n I think it'd be nice to maybe honor him\n\n53:00.520 --> 53:02.320\n to break it apart a little bit.\n\n53:02.320 --> 53:03.400\n Aaron Schwartz.\n\n53:03.400 --> 53:04.520\n Yeah.\n\n53:04.520 --> 53:08.640\n Why was he a special human being in this ilk\n\n53:08.640 --> 53:11.720\n of what we're talking about now, civil disobedience?\n\n53:11.720 --> 53:15.880\n How do we honor him now moving forward as human beings\n\n53:15.880 --> 53:19.080\n who are willing to take risks in this world?\n\n53:19.080 --> 53:20.160\n Well, I don't know.\n\n53:20.160 --> 53:23.760\n I mean, are you inspired by Aaron Schwartz?\n\n53:23.760 --> 53:24.600\n I am.\n\n53:24.600 --> 53:25.720\n How do you feel about JSTOR?\n\n53:25.720 --> 53:27.400\n Let's talk about JSTOR first.\n\n53:27.400 --> 53:30.920\n So let's say what JSTOR is all about, right?\n\n53:30.920 --> 53:34.520\n We the taxpayer pay for research.\n\n53:36.080 --> 53:41.080\n And then the people who do the research\n\n53:41.140 --> 53:43.360\n do all the work for a bunch of companies\n\n53:43.360 --> 53:47.020\n who then charge us $30 an article\n\n53:47.020 --> 53:48.940\n to read what it is that we already paid for.\n\n53:48.940 --> 53:51.360\n And if we don't cite these articles,\n\n53:51.360 --> 53:53.400\n we're told that we're in violation.\n\n53:53.400 --> 53:54.240\n Okay.\n\n53:55.280 --> 53:58.240\n I almost never call for civil disobedience\n\n53:58.240 --> 54:03.240\n because I don't really want to, but fuck JSTOR,\n\n54:03.280 --> 54:05.200\n fuck Elsevier, fuck Springer.\n\n54:05.200 --> 54:07.280\n Who the fuck are these people?\n\n54:07.280 --> 54:08.120\n Yeah.\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:13.120\n Get the smart people need to take the greedy people\n\n54:15.920 --> 54:19.680\n behind the woodshed and explain to them what science is.\n\n54:19.680 --> 54:23.440\n I have a very old fashioned idea that's so out of favor\n\n54:23.440 --> 54:26.200\n that I will immediately be seen as a knuckle dragger.\n\n54:26.200 --> 54:27.680\n Yeah.\n\n54:27.680 --> 54:29.800\n I believe in the great woman theory of history\n\n54:29.800 --> 54:31.700\n and the great man theory of history.\n\n54:31.700 --> 54:34.700\n Emmy Nerder is fantastic as an example.\n\n54:34.700 --> 54:39.700\n As an example, and I believe in editors over peer reviewers.\n\n54:41.420 --> 54:43.820\n And I believe that wrong things should be allowed\n\n54:43.820 --> 54:45.180\n into the literature.\n\n54:45.180 --> 54:48.340\n And I believe that the gatekeeping should go towards zero\n\n54:48.340 --> 54:52.020\n because the costs associated with distribution\n\n54:52.020 --> 54:53.300\n are very, very slight.\n\n54:53.300 --> 54:57.020\n I believe that we should be looking\n\n54:57.020 --> 55:01.180\n at the perverse incentives of sending your paper blindly\n\n55:01.180 --> 55:02.620\n into your competitor's clutches,\n\n55:02.620 --> 55:05.260\n particularly if you're a young person being reviewed\n\n55:05.260 --> 55:06.520\n by an older person.\n\n55:07.460 --> 55:10.420\n Are you familiar with the Duat de Senor?\n\n55:11.920 --> 55:14.320\n Are you familiar with the legend of the Magnaia?\n\n55:15.820 --> 55:18.420\n No, the Magnaia is the Miller's daughter\n\n55:18.420 --> 55:21.500\n and the largest food fight in the entire universe,\n\n55:21.500 --> 55:25.660\n I believe is held, I think in Italy,\n\n55:25.660 --> 55:27.640\n it's called the Battle of the Oranges.\n\n55:27.640 --> 55:31.420\n And it celebrates the Miller's daughter\n\n55:31.420 --> 55:34.540\n who had fallen in love with her beloved.\n\n55:34.540 --> 55:38.380\n And when it came time for them to marry,\n\n55:38.380 --> 55:41.980\n the virginal Magnaia was in fact told\n\n55:41.980 --> 55:46.060\n that the Lord of the land had the right\n\n55:46.060 --> 55:48.820\n to have the first night with the bride.\n\n55:48.820 --> 55:51.340\n Well, the Magnaia had a different idea.\n\n55:51.340 --> 55:56.020\n So she seemed to consent to this perhaps mythical right,\n\n55:56.020 --> 55:59.220\n also called the Prima Note, the first night.\n\n55:59.220 --> 56:04.080\n And by legend, she concealed a dagger underneath her robes.\n\n56:05.580 --> 56:08.460\n And when it came time for the hated Lord of the Manor\n\n56:08.460 --> 56:13.460\n to extract this right, she pulled the knife out\n\n56:13.700 --> 56:14.540\n and killed him.\n\n56:14.540 --> 56:16.320\n And I think it also echoes a little bit\n\n56:16.320 --> 56:19.260\n of particularly wonderful scene from Game of Thrones.\n\n56:20.320 --> 56:23.580\n But that inspired both men and women.\n\n56:23.580 --> 56:26.100\n And the Magnaia is the legendary hero.\n\n56:26.100 --> 56:30.960\n So right now, what we need to do is we need\n\n56:30.960 --> 56:35.960\n to resist the Prima Note, the right of first look, right?\n\n56:36.160 --> 56:38.320\n F you, you don't have the right of first look.\n\n56:38.320 --> 56:40.760\n I don't wanna send something blindly to my competitors.\n\n56:40.760 --> 56:42.800\n I don't wanna subject myself to you naming\n\n56:42.800 --> 56:44.680\n what work I've done.\n\n56:45.760 --> 56:48.020\n Why are you in my story?\n\n56:48.020 --> 56:50.000\n That's my question, get out of my story.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.640\n If I do work and then you have an idea,\n\n56:52.640 --> 56:54.400\n oh, well, it's the Matthew principle.\n\n56:54.400 --> 56:57.720\n To him who has much more will be given.\n\n56:57.720 --> 56:59.640\n I've gone to the National Academy of Sciences\n\n56:59.640 --> 57:00.860\n and talked about these things.\n\n57:00.860 --> 57:03.720\n And it's funny, I've been laughed at by the older people\n\n57:03.720 --> 57:07.080\n who think, well, Eric, you know science proceeds\n\n57:07.080 --> 57:09.720\n funeral by funeral, that's Planck.\n\n57:09.720 --> 57:11.080\n You know the Matthew principle,\n\n57:11.080 --> 57:12.200\n you know the Matilda principle,\n\n57:12.200 --> 57:14.520\n the things done by women are attributed to men.\n\n57:14.520 --> 57:16.280\n That these are not new.\n\n57:16.280 --> 57:17.760\n And you guys just live like this?\n\n57:17.760 --> 57:20.920\n Yeah, so the Revolutionary Act now is to resist\n\n57:20.920 --> 57:23.920\n all of these things that are not new.\n\n57:23.920 --> 57:25.440\n So you asked me about Aaron Schwartz.\n\n57:25.440 --> 57:27.240\n Aaron Schwartz was the Magnaia.\n\n57:27.240 --> 57:29.360\n One of the things you've done very beautifully\n\n57:29.360 --> 57:31.880\n is to communicate love.\n\n57:31.880 --> 57:35.560\n And I think about some of our conversations.\n\n57:35.560 --> 57:37.280\n And you got me to talk a little bit about\n\n57:37.280 --> 57:41.480\n my own experiences in 02138 and 39.\n\n57:45.360 --> 57:47.740\n We are the product of our trauma.\n\n57:48.760 --> 57:51.160\n And what people don't understand is that very often\n\n57:51.160 --> 57:54.720\n when you see people taking countermeasures\n\n57:54.720 --> 57:57.840\n against what appear to be imaginary forces,\n\n57:57.840 --> 57:59.720\n they're really actually replaying things\n\n57:59.720 --> 58:01.120\n that really happened to them.\n\n58:02.640 --> 58:05.480\n And having been through this system and watching\n\n58:05.480 --> 58:08.280\n all of the ways in which it completely rewrites\n\n58:08.280 --> 58:10.720\n the lives of the people who I am counting on\n\n58:10.720 --> 58:12.760\n to cure our diseases, build our new industries,\n\n58:12.760 --> 58:14.280\n keep us safe from our foes,\n\n58:15.800 --> 58:18.760\n the amount of pressure the system is putting\n\n58:18.760 --> 58:23.320\n on the most hopeful minds is unimaginable.\n\n58:23.320 --> 58:26.680\n And so my goal is to empower somebody\n\n58:26.680 --> 58:28.600\n like an Aaron Schwartz in memory\n\n58:29.560 --> 58:32.320\n and to talk about a Jeffrey Epstein situation.\n\n58:32.320 --> 58:36.640\n Do you know that the first person outside of me\n\n58:36.640 --> 58:39.920\n to get a look at geometric unity was Jeffrey Epstein?\n\n58:42.280 --> 58:44.920\n How did he know I was working on this?\n\n58:44.920 --> 58:46.000\n I don't know.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:49.320\n So your ideas that formed geometric unity\n\n58:49.320 --> 58:51.880\n was something that his eyes have seen?\n\n58:51.880 --> 58:55.120\n I was pushed to talk to Jeffrey Epstein\n\n58:55.120 --> 58:59.120\n as one of the only people who could help me.\n\n58:59.120 --> 59:00.760\n No, no, no, listen to this.\n\n59:00.760 --> 59:01.760\n Yeah, how does this connect?\n\n59:01.760 --> 59:06.400\n Okay, well, first of all, my old synagogue,\n\n59:06.400 --> 59:10.000\n my old shul was the conservative minion at Harvard Hillel.\n\n59:11.200 --> 59:14.240\n And I believe it's called Rosovsky Hall\n\n59:14.240 --> 59:17.240\n after Henry Rosovsky in the economics department,\n\n59:17.240 --> 59:20.240\n who was a Japan scholar, if I'm correct.\n\n59:20.240 --> 59:23.440\n And he became provost or dean of Harvard.\n\n59:25.160 --> 59:28.160\n I believe that that was built with Jeffrey Epstein's money.\n\n59:29.480 --> 59:32.840\n And I wondered in part whether the Jewish students\n\n59:32.840 --> 59:35.720\n at Harvard all sort of passed through a bottleneck\n\n59:35.720 --> 59:37.320\n of Harvard Hillel.\n\n59:37.320 --> 59:39.080\n So that was something I found very curious,\n\n59:39.080 --> 59:40.520\n but I don't know much about it.\n\n59:41.480 --> 59:43.240\n I also found that Jeffrey Epstein hanging around\n\n59:43.240 --> 59:46.440\n scientists, I don't think that either you or Joe exactly,\n\n59:46.440 --> 59:51.440\n I mean, got me correct in your last interchange.\n\n59:51.440 --> 59:53.120\n For the record, for people who haven't listened\n\n59:53.120 --> 59:55.760\n to Joe Rogan program, Joe has claimed that Eric Weinstein\n\n59:55.760 --> 59:57.960\n was the only person who has gotten laid.\n\n59:57.960 --> 59:58.800\n Paid.\n\n59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.840\n Oh, paid.\n\n1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:04.560\n And you said you also got paid as a young man, right?\n\n1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:07.600\n I believe the word was laid, but allegedly.\n\n1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:09.800\n My hearing isn't so good at age 55.\n\n1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.400\n All right, leaving that aside.\n\n1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:16.120\n Leaving that aside, what was Jeffrey Epstein doing\n\n1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:18.080\n hanging around all of these scientists?\n\n1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:20.760\n I don't think that was the same program\n\n1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:24.760\n that was about compromising political leaders\n\n1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:27.360\n and business people and entertainment figures.\n\n1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:29.120\n I think these are two different programs\n\n1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:31.760\n that were being run through one individual.\n\n1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:35.480\n And Joe seemed to think that I didn't think he was smooth.\n\n1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:36.740\n I thought he was glib.\n\n1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.960\n I think what Joe is really trying to get at is that\n\n1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:43.240\n I found his mysticism meretricious.\n\n1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:48.120\n He had an ability to deflect every conversation\n\n1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:50.160\n that might go towards revealing\n\n1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:51.640\n that he didn't know what he was talking about.\n\n1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:54.640\n Every time you started to get close to something\n\n1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:55.820\n where the rubber hit the road,\n\n1:00:55.820 --> 1:00:58.320\n the rubber wouldn't hit the road.\n\n1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:02.400\n And yet, can you help me untangle the fact\n\n1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:07.260\n that you thought deeply about the physics\n\n1:01:07.260 --> 1:01:10.520\n of the nature of our universe\n\n1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:13.520\n and Jeffrey Epstein was interested?\n\n1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:14.840\n How did he know?\n\n1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:17.420\n I wasn't really talking about this stuff until,\n\n1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:22.240\n even my close friends didn't really know what I was up to.\n\n1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:25.360\n And yet you're saying he did not have\n\n1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:27.540\n sufficient brilliance to understand\n\n1:01:27.540 --> 1:01:28.660\n when the rubber hit the road.\n\n1:01:28.660 --> 1:01:33.080\n So why did he have sufficient interest and curiosity?\n\n1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:34.660\n I'll tell you what I thought.\n\n1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:36.160\n I had been waiting to find out,\n\n1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:38.380\n does my government even know I exist?\n\n1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:40.960\n Do you have an answer to that question?\n\n1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:44.320\n I have, a couple times the government\n\n1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:45.440\n has reached out to me.\n\n1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:49.600\n In general, there is zero interest in me,\n\n1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.420\n like less than zero interest.\n\n1:01:52.420 --> 1:01:54.440\n I find that fascinating.\n\n1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:56.320\n As far as you know, right?\n\n1:01:56.320 --> 1:01:57.680\n Well, that's what I'm trying to say.\n\n1:01:57.680 --> 1:01:59.800\n The question about not being able to see\n\n1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:01.960\n through a half silvered mirror,\n\n1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:03.580\n you don't know what's going on\n\n1:02:03.580 --> 1:02:04.940\n behind the half silvered mirror.\n\n1:02:04.940 --> 1:02:09.120\n To you, it's all you see is your reflection.\n\n1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:10.920\n But your intuition still holds,\n\n1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:12.980\n like this is where I've mentioned that I,\n\n1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:16.200\n this is where I'll say naive dumb things,\n\n1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:20.880\n but I still hold on to this intuition that Jeff,\n\n1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:21.920\n I'm not confident in this,\n\n1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:25.160\n but I lean towards that direction\n\n1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:27.360\n that Jeffrey Epstein is the source of evil,\n\n1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:29.760\n not something that's underlying him.\n\n1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:31.480\n You have a bias.\n\n1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:32.760\n It's different than mine.\n\n1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:35.200\n Our Bayesian priors are tutored\n\n1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.760\n by different life experiences.\n\n1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:42.200\n If I was mostly concerned, like Sam Harris is concerned,\n\n1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:44.360\n that people fill their heads with nonsense,\n\n1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:47.700\n I would have a very strong sense\n\n1:02:47.700 --> 1:02:49.400\n that people need order in the world,\n\n1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:51.720\n that they take mysterious situations,\n\n1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:53.640\n they build entire castles in the air,\n\n1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:56.440\n and then they go move in if they really get crazy.\n\n1:02:56.440 --> 1:03:01.000\n The old saying is that neurotics build castles in the air\n\n1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.640\n and psychotics move in.\n\n1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.000\n Coming from a progressive family,\n\n1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:06.480\n we had a different experience.\n\n1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:07.720\n It's really weird when the government\n\n1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:09.000\n is actually out to get you,\n\n1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.060\n when they actually send a spy,\n\n1:03:11.060 --> 1:03:14.000\n when they actually engage in disinformation campaigns,\n\n1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.640\n when they smear you.\n\n1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:19.040\n And if you've ever had that brought to bear on your family,\n\n1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:22.600\n you have a Howard Zinn sort of understanding of the country,\n\n1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:25.200\n which is different than having a,\n\n1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:27.200\n wow, do people believe crazy stuff\n\n1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.820\n because they watch too much TV.\n\n1:03:29.820 --> 1:03:32.280\n And both of these things have some merit to them,\n\n1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:34.200\n but it's a question of regulated expression.\n\n1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:36.460\n When do you want to express more Sam Harris\n\n1:03:36.460 --> 1:03:38.800\n and when do you want to express more Howard Zinn?\n\n1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.400\n And you can express both, correct?\n\n1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:42.840\n The one human being can express both?\n\n1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:44.940\n Sure, but there's a trade off between them.\n\n1:03:44.940 --> 1:03:47.640\n In other words, most people like the Michael Shermers\n\n1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.680\n of the world are gonna tilt very strongly\n\n1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:52.440\n to extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\n\n1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:54.320\n So you're gonna have that kind of energy.\n\n1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:55.600\n And then somebody else is gonna say,\n\n1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:58.240\n how many times do I have to get hit on,\n\n1:03:58.240 --> 1:03:59.760\n how many times do I have to hammer my own thumb\n\n1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:02.040\n before I realize that there's a problem?\n\n1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:04.680\n So my feeling about this is yes,\n\n1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:06.520\n people see patterns in clouds.\n\n1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:09.240\n They see faces and scripture and all sorts of things,\n\n1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:10.680\n and it's just random cloud patterns.\n\n1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:13.880\n And it's also the case that there's tremendous pressure\n\n1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:16.180\n not to see conspiracies when conspiracies\n\n1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:18.400\n are relatively more common than the people\n\n1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:21.280\n who shout conspiracy theory will claim.\n\n1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:22.680\n So both of these things are true.\n\n1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:25.160\n And you have to ask, when do you express your inner Zinn\n\n1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:26.920\n and when your inner Harris?\n\n1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:27.880\n And those are different.\n\n1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:28.720\n I want to find them out.\n\n1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:31.500\n The difference in you and I biases aside\n\n1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:33.480\n is you've actually met Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:38.480\n And I'm listening to reverberations years later\n\n1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:42.920\n of stories and narratives throughout the story.\n\n1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:44.480\n Luckily, I only met him once.\n\n1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:49.280\n And I think I had one or perhaps two phone conversations\n\n1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:51.080\n with him other than the one meeting.\n\n1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:54.360\n You can learn a lot in just a few words, right,\n\n1:04:54.360 --> 1:04:55.200\n from a human being.\n\n1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:57.640\n Well, that's true, but I think that the bigger issue\n\n1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:01.240\n was I saw something that I don't hear much remarked upon,\n\n1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:05.020\n which is Jeffrey Epstein is all that there is.\n\n1:05:05.880 --> 1:05:08.760\n In other words, there's the National Science Foundation,\n\n1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:11.440\n National Institute of Health, Howard Hughes.\n\n1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:16.260\n There's all this stuff that kind of has the same feel to it,\n\n1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:18.200\n a little bit of variation and difference,\n\n1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:19.260\n Department of Energy.\n\n1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:23.900\n If you fall outside of that, there's just Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n1:05:23.900 --> 1:05:25.200\n That's what you're told.\n\n1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:26.040\n Yes.\n\n1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:26.860\n That's not quite true.\n\n1:05:26.860 --> 1:05:30.000\n There's Kavli, maybe Jim Simons is now in the game.\n\n1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.040\n Peter Thiel has done some stuff.\n\n1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:35.160\n You had Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg try.\n\n1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:38.340\n So there is other money running around, Templeton.\n\n1:05:39.620 --> 1:05:41.960\n But very strongly, there was a belief\n\n1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:44.040\n that if you're doing something really innovative\n\n1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:48.200\n and the system can't fund it because we become pussies,\n\n1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:49.560\n Jeffrey Epstein's your guy.\n\n1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.200\n So there's like this funnel\n\n1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:53.080\n that you're supposed to go through.\n\n1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:54.000\n That's right.\n\n1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:55.360\n And the idea is that you get called\n\n1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:00.360\n the great man's house and the sort of lubricious version\n\n1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:07.880\n of Ralph Lauren takes you in and asks you bizarre questions.\n\n1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:10.960\n And maybe he has an island, maybe he has a plane.\n\n1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:15.960\n And when you're starved, somebody showing you a feast\n\n1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:20.720\n or when you're dehydrated in a death's door\n\n1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:25.720\n and somebody says, oh, I have a well, that's what it is.\n\n1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:32.280\n And so the thought is, wow, can somebody get some effing\n\n1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:34.840\n money into the science system so that we don't have\n\n1:06:34.840 --> 1:06:38.200\n super creeps trying to learn all of our secrets\n\n1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:39.320\n ahead of time?\n\n1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:42.280\n WTF, what is your problem with transparency\n\n1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:43.320\n and taxpayer dollars?\n\n1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:46.480\n Just all of you, you wouldn't have a country.\n\n1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:47.880\n You'd be speaking German.\n\n1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:51.240\n So essentially you believe that human beings\n\n1:06:51.240 --> 1:06:54.080\n would not be able to, when the money is lacking\n\n1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:55.840\n in the system, like in research.\n\n1:06:55.840 --> 1:06:57.200\n We produce public goods.\n\n1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:00.320\n You and I are meant to produce public goods.\n\n1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:03.280\n Now I sell Athletic Greens and I sell Theragun\n\n1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:07.720\n and I sell Unagi scooters and Chili Pad.\n\n1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:09.640\n Can I be honest, I love these products,\n\n1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:14.640\n but I didn't get into this game for the purpose of selling.\n\n1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:19.640\n I'm trying to figure out how do you have an FU lifestyle?\n\n1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:22.800\n But you know something Lex, I don't know why you built\n\n1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.640\n this channel, it's kind of a mystery.\n\n1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:26.040\n I don't know why.\n\n1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:28.200\n I'll tell you why I built my channel.\n\n1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:32.360\n It's gonna be a lot harder to roll me this time in an alley.\n\n1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:37.360\n I got rolled multiple times and my point is I didn't want\n\n1:07:37.880 --> 1:07:41.040\n to become a celebrity, I didn't want to become well known,\n\n1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:46.040\n but it's a lot harder to roll somebody who's getting,\n\n1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.800\n I think I'm, I don't know if this is mistaken,\n\n1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:52.160\n but I think I'm the math PhD with the largest number\n\n1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.400\n of followers on Twitter.\n\n1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:58.760\n And there was nothing you could do before.\n\n1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:01.000\n I mean again, to put a little responsibility on you,\n\n1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.880\n so you've created something really special\n\n1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:06.200\n for the distribution of your own ideas.\n\n1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:11.040\n I mean, but because it's not necessarily currently scalable,\n\n1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:15.720\n you also, perhaps you and I have the responsibility\n\n1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:19.480\n of giving other people also a chance to spread their ideas.\n\n1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:21.320\n I mean Joe Rogan did this very effectively\n\n1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:23.720\n for a bunch of people that.\n\n1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:26.440\n That's why they're angry at him because he's a gatekeeper\n\n1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:29.600\n and he let all sorts of people through that gate\n\n1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:32.840\n from Roger Penrose to Alex Jones.\n\n1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:37.840\n To Jordan Peterson to, I mean, even first of all, to you.\n\n1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:39.920\n To Abby Martin.\n\n1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:40.840\n To Abby Martin.\n\n1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:42.040\n To Barry Weiss.\n\n1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:43.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:44.700\n That's the problem.\n\n1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:48.960\n Well, but you have not successfully built up a thing\n\n1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:50.280\n that allows that to carry that forward.\n\n1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:52.000\n Oh no, no, no, no.\n\n1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000\n We are all vulnerable to reputational attack\n\n1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:59.840\n because what happens, you see, the problem, Lex,\n\n1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:02.920\n is that you are now an institution at some level.\n\n1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:06.560\n You walk around with all this equipment in a duffel bag.\n\n1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:10.520\n The last suit you'll ever need.\n\n1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:15.520\n And you have the reach of something like CNN\n\n1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:17.740\n to people who matter.\n\n1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:20.320\n Okay.\n\n1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:23.540\n So now the question is, how do we control something\n\n1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:25.360\n that doesn't have a board, doesn't have shareholders,\n\n1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:28.460\n doesn't have to make SEC filings, FCC.\n\n1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:31.420\n So the best answer they have is,\n\n1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:36.360\n well, we just have to destroy reputations.\n\n1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:38.400\n All it takes is for us to take something\n\n1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:40.160\n that gets said or done or alleged.\n\n1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:43.080\n And I think it's incredibly important.\n\n1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:46.000\n One of the things people don't understand is that\n\n1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.760\n I'm going to fight general reputational attacks.\n\n1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:51.560\n Not because some people don't deserve\n\n1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:55.160\n to have their reputations dragged through the mud,\n\n1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:58.260\n but because it's too powerful of a tool\n\n1:09:58.260 --> 1:10:02.880\n to hand it to CNN, MSNBC, Princeton, Harvard,\n\n1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:04.440\n the State Department.\n\n1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:05.280\n Yes.\n\n1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:07.460\n But some of it is also.\n\n1:10:07.460 --> 1:10:09.060\n J.P. Morgan.\n\n1:10:09.060 --> 1:10:13.520\n Muhammad Ali style, being good enough at\n\n1:10:15.540 --> 1:10:17.040\n doing everything you need to do\n\n1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:21.660\n without giving enough meat for the reputational attacks.\n\n1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:25.080\n Not being afraid, but not giving enough meat.\n\n1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:28.040\n I don't see why the people who have good ideas\n\n1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:30.200\n have to lead lives that are that clean.\n\n1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:31.040\n If you can do it.\n\n1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:32.200\n You can be messy, yeah.\n\n1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:34.000\n You should be able to be messy.\n\n1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:37.060\n Otherwise, we're suppressing too many people.\n\n1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:39.040\n Too many, too brilliant minds.\n\n1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:39.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:42.720\n Can you believe Elon Musk smoked a blunt?\n\n1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:44.400\n I still, people tell me this.\n\n1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:48.000\n Okay, I have discussions about Elon and people,\n\n1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:54.120\n the Avi Loeb, the Harvard scientist,\n\n1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:56.220\n who's talking about a Muammuah\n\n1:10:56.220 --> 1:10:58.520\n that it might be alien technology.\n\n1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:03.520\n He told me his, this outside the box thinker.\n\n1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:05.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:09.560\n When speaking to me about Elon said,\n\n1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:13.880\n called him the guy who smoked, he smokes weed.\n\n1:11:13.880 --> 1:11:14.720\n The blunt.\n\n1:11:14.720 --> 1:11:15.540\n I love it.\n\n1:11:15.540 --> 1:11:16.480\n In a dismissive way.\n\n1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:20.160\n Like this guy's crazy because he smoked some weed.\n\n1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.560\n I was looking at him.\n\n1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:23.040\n I was like, why?\n\n1:11:23.040 --> 1:11:24.160\n Wow.\n\n1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:25.140\n Wow.\n\n1:11:25.140 --> 1:11:26.880\n I think you should be able to have\n\n1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:30.320\n consensual drug filled orgies.\n\n1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.480\n Fuck perfect lives.\n\n1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:34.360\n Yeah, you should be allowed to be messy.\n\n1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:35.200\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:36.040\n I take back my statement.\n\n1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:37.120\n I'm just saying.\n\n1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:40.340\n Respectability is the unique prison\n\n1:11:40.340 --> 1:11:43.060\n where all of the gates are open\n\n1:11:43.060 --> 1:11:45.600\n and the inmates beg to stay inside.\n\n1:11:46.940 --> 1:11:49.800\n It's time to end their prison of respectability\n\n1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:53.020\n because it's too effective of a means of sidelining\n\n1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:54.720\n and silencing people.\n\n1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:58.880\n Including it is better that we have bad people\n\n1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:03.880\n in our system than this idea of no platforming people\n\n1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:08.200\n who are beyond the pale because it's such a simple technique.\n\n1:12:08.200 --> 1:12:11.780\n So how do we, what's the heroic action here on the?\n\n1:12:11.780 --> 1:12:15.280\n Well, for example, having Ashley Matthews on my program.\n\n1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:20.280\n By the way, she was absolutely delightful as a guest.\n\n1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:23.840\n She was, she is polite in the extreme,\n\n1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:26.060\n far more polite than I am.\n\n1:12:26.060 --> 1:12:29.380\n And I had her right after Roger Penrose as a guest\n\n1:12:29.380 --> 1:12:32.200\n because I wanted to highlight this program can go anywhere.\n\n1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:33.640\n We can talk to anyone.\n\n1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:34.600\n What about social media?\n\n1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:37.080\n You've started highlighting people being banned\n\n1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:38.720\n on social media.\n\n1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:40.440\n How do we fight this?\n\n1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:42.240\n Like if you get banned from social media,\n\n1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:44.520\n so you're saying nobody will stand up to me.\n\n1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:46.440\n Well, just figure out what your incentive structure\n\n1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:47.280\n is before.\n\n1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.660\n Assume that I get banned on social media\n\n1:12:49.660 --> 1:12:51.120\n because somebody wants to make sure\n\n1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:53.720\n that my message doesn't interfere\n\n1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:55.080\n with the dominant narrative.\n\n1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:55.920\n Okay.\n\n1:12:58.920 --> 1:12:59.960\n What will happen, by the way,\n\n1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:02.320\n I'm very glad to be able to explain this on your show\n\n1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:05.720\n because that video will presumably be archived\n\n1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:08.920\n and they can't easily make you take it down.\n\n1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:09.800\n Okay.\n\n1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:11.300\n So what's gonna happen is,\n\n1:13:11.300 --> 1:13:12.640\n is that there'll be a whole bunch\n\n1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:16.960\n of very low quality bot like accounts\n\n1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:19.240\n that dog you every time you talk about me.\n\n1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:22.160\n Right, dude, it's getting old, getting boring.\n\n1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:23.480\n We already heard you.\n\n1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:25.860\n Dude, that was like, let it go.\n\n1:13:25.860 --> 1:13:27.120\n Not a good look.\n\n1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:29.200\n Not a good look is one of my favorites.\n\n1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:30.960\n But what about the high profile ones?\n\n1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:32.800\n Well, then you'll get a few high profile ones\n\n1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:37.100\n and some of the high profile ones command armies.\n\n1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:37.940\n Right.\n\n1:13:37.940 --> 1:13:40.280\n Like at some point I had 10,000 people\n\n1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:43.560\n using exactly the same templated tweet, tweeting at me.\n\n1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:45.340\n It was just actually, it got to the point\n\n1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:48.000\n where it was funny because everybody said,\n\n1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:49.960\n did you hear that in a hipster coffee shop?\n\n1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:50.800\n And I was like,\n\n1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:52.840\n why are you all suddenly talking about hipster coffee?\n\n1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:54.220\n Just hilarious.\n\n1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:58.940\n Those things will cause you to think better of it.\n\n1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:01.180\n You'll start to see your follower count go down\n\n1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:04.480\n because it's easy to give you a bunch of bot like follows\n\n1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.060\n and then just pull them.\n\n1:14:06.060 --> 1:14:09.680\n So I think that's pretty well known how,\n\n1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:11.600\n and then maybe your account will be suspended\n\n1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:14.440\n and it can't be revoked and et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:17.380\n And then three days later, you'll be told it was an error.\n\n1:14:17.380 --> 1:14:18.320\n So let me push back.\n\n1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:20.480\n I just don't see not defending you.\n\n1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:23.760\n Like, okay, so what are the things you would do\n\n1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:27.840\n that given that I can actually talk to you offline,\n\n1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:31.360\n that would make me not defend you?\n\n1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:37.640\n Well, first of all, I can't, I mean, I can imagine some,\n\n1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:39.640\n but all of us have things.\n\n1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:41.800\n If somebody says, do you hear what your boy,\n\n1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:43.560\n Lex said about you?\n\n1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:45.660\n What did Lex say about me?\n\n1:14:45.660 --> 1:14:48.320\n Oh, he said you were flawed, dude.\n\n1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:49.160\n Oh, shit.\n\n1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:53.760\n They so distressed\n\n1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:57.060\n because none of us wanna stand behind flawed people.\n\n1:14:57.060 --> 1:14:58.760\n That's why you have everybody rushing to say,\n\n1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:00.080\n I neither condemn nor condone.\n\n1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:02.780\n I know I don't condemn nor, what is that?\n\n1:15:02.780 --> 1:15:03.620\n We're all trying to say.\n\n1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:04.980\n By the way, for the record,\n\n1:15:04.980 --> 1:15:07.340\n I said that Eric is smarter than me\n\n1:15:07.340 --> 1:15:10.880\n in a brilliant human being, but flawed like all humans are.\n\n1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:14.160\n My point is I've now come up with a new policy,\n\n1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:16.700\n which is I don't care what my friends have done.\n\n1:15:17.580 --> 1:15:20.040\n I am not disavowing my friends,\n\n1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:22.080\n not because they didn't do the wrong thing.\n\n1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:23.380\n Maybe they did do the wrong thing.\n\n1:15:23.380 --> 1:15:24.220\n I don't know.\n\n1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:28.320\n What's the value of friendship if that's not that?\n\n1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:29.920\n Like, for example, we've had the situation\n\n1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:30.880\n with Brian Callan.\n\n1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:34.000\n Brian Callan was featured recently in the Los Angeles Times.\n\n1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:36.920\n I know nothing about the allegations.\n\n1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:39.760\n I can't, I didn't even know Brian at the time, right?\n\n1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:42.340\n I've known him for roughly the time I've been in Los Angeles,\n\n1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:44.960\n maybe a year and a half during that period of time.\n\n1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:46.560\n I've never seen anything wrong.\n\n1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:50.040\n Now I'm in a situation, well, what do you think he did?\n\n1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:50.880\n Do you think he didn't?\n\n1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:52.440\n It's like, you know what?\n\n1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:54.660\n I don't know, but I do know this.\n\n1:15:54.660 --> 1:15:56.880\n Everyone's entitled to have friends\n\n1:15:56.880 --> 1:15:59.060\n because we can't afford isolated people.\n\n1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:02.200\n And if your friends do the wrong thing,\n\n1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.280\n they're still your friends.\n\n1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:06.200\n And if they do terrible, terrible things,\n\n1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.960\n you bring that up with them privately.\n\n1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:12.400\n And it's not my responsibility to disavow in public.\n\n1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:15.840\n We've had the situation that I don't like\n\n1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:19.240\n where particular people that I've been close to,\n\n1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:21.880\n I'm put under tremendous pressure to disavow them.\n\n1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:24.160\n What do you think now about your buddy?\n\n1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:26.040\n I like Dave Rubin, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:28.960\n Here's the thing, my friends are my friends.\n\n1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:30.760\n I don't disavow my friends.\n\n1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:34.300\n We all need to make a statement\n\n1:16:34.300 --> 1:16:36.760\n that we will not be brought under pressure\n\n1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:40.840\n to disavow our friends, our family members,\n\n1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:45.840\n because mass murderers are dangerous\n\n1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:48.140\n the more isolated they become.\n\n1:16:48.140 --> 1:16:52.920\n It is not a good idea to constantly push to isolate people.\n\n1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:53.760\n Yes.\n\n1:16:53.760 --> 1:16:54.600\n And it's dangerous, and so.\n\n1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:56.400\n And it sends a signal to everybody else\n\n1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:00.720\n to fit in, to be more cynical about the human.\n\n1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:04.140\n So my feeling, if I find out you've been selling heroin\n\n1:17:04.140 --> 1:17:06.480\n to elementary school students,\n\n1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:09.480\n you're still my friend, and I will not be disavowing you.\n\n1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:11.840\n And if I have a problem with you selling heroin\n\n1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:14.900\n to elementary school students during school hours,\n\n1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:18.800\n I will bring it up with you privately,\n\n1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:21.540\n because we don't need to hear my voice\n\n1:17:21.540 --> 1:17:23.020\n added to that condemnation.\n\n1:17:23.020 --> 1:17:25.020\n Are there things that you could do\n\n1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:27.880\n that would cause me to say, actually, F this guy?\n\n1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:29.640\n Yeah, above and beyond that.\n\n1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:32.200\n But simply doing the wrong thing,\n\n1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:34.760\n I think we've gone down a terrible path.\n\n1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:37.280\n I think isolated people are about the most dangerous thing\n\n1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:40.320\n we could have in a heavily armed society.\n\n1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:43.400\n So I deeply agree with you on Brian Callan\n\n1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:46.300\n and on all these people that, quote, unquote, got canceled.\n\n1:17:47.480 --> 1:17:49.120\n And I'm not saying that they,\n\n1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:52.080\n I don't know the truth value, because we can't.\n\n1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:53.800\n And even if I did know the truth value,\n\n1:17:53.800 --> 1:17:56.840\n I'm not setting up an incentive structure\n\n1:17:56.840 --> 1:17:59.720\n for the personal destruction\n\n1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:02.900\n as a means of letting institutions combat\n\n1:18:02.900 --> 1:18:05.440\n the fact that individuals are the last thing that can say,\n\n1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:07.080\n none of you guys make any sense.\n\n1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:09.680\n I don't treat these things like,\n\n1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:12.240\n I had a conversation where Kevin Spacey\n\n1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:15.540\n was at the dinner table when I came down from a hotel room.\n\n1:18:15.540 --> 1:18:18.560\n And I had a very long conversation with Kevin Spacey.\n\n1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:21.680\n I will not detail, because I don't do that,\n\n1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:23.520\n as to what we discussed.\n\n1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:27.020\n But we talked very specifically about him being canceled.\n\n1:18:27.020 --> 1:18:30.280\n And I don't think that the world has heard that story\n\n1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:33.760\n in part because there's a very strong sense\n\n1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:35.720\n that he has to be outgrouped.\n\n1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:39.200\n And as a result, I mean, do we want,\n\n1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:42.920\n do we want to disavow the space program\n\n1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:44.560\n because it touched Werner von Braun?\n\n1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:46.180\n Do we want to disavow quantum mechanics\n\n1:18:46.180 --> 1:18:49.400\n because Pascal Jordan and Werner Heisenberg passed through it?\n\n1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:53.040\n Is Ehrenfest's theorem false because he murdered his child?\n\n1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:55.720\n I mean, at what point do we recognize\n\n1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:57.800\n that we are the problem?\n\n1:18:57.800 --> 1:18:58.940\n Humans are humans.\n\n1:18:58.940 --> 1:19:01.760\n And there is no perfect,\n\n1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:03.080\n there is no perfect group of people,\n\n1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:04.920\n even all of the most oppressed people,\n\n1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:06.620\n the supposed victims of the world,\n\n1:19:06.620 --> 1:19:08.440\n who we now have fetishized into thinking\n\n1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:09.520\n that they're all oracles\n\n1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:12.080\n because their lived experience informs us\n\n1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:14.920\n and their pain is more salient than everyone else's pain.\n\n1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:18.420\n Those people aren't necessarily great people.\n\n1:19:19.800 --> 1:19:24.800\n It's like none of us, we can't do this in this fashion.\n\n1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:27.640\n So when we sit down to have a conversation\n\n1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:29.680\n across the table from somebody,\n\n1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:31.200\n you should be willing to,\n\n1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:33.880\n like you should not have NPR in your mind.\n\n1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.680\n You should be willing to take the full risk\n\n1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:38.680\n and to see the good in the person\n\n1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:41.920\n with limited information\n\n1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:44.520\n and to do your best to understand that person.\n\n1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:47.200\n Everybody is entitled to a hypocrisy budget.\n\n1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:51.480\n I don't believe this is of institutions, okay?\n\n1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:52.920\n Everybody is entitled\n\n1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:55.160\n to a certain amount of screwing up in life.\n\n1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:57.800\n You're entitled to a mendacity budget.\n\n1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:00.920\n You're entitled to an aggression budget.\n\n1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:03.360\n The idea of getting rid of everybody,\n\n1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:06.800\n you know, people haven't even blown through their budgets\n\n1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:07.640\n and we're already.\n\n1:20:07.640 --> 1:20:11.200\n Yeah, I think about, for example, one person,\n\n1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:14.720\n I'd be curious to get your thoughts about Alex Jones.\n\n1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:16.200\n Let's not talk about Alex Jones for a second.\n\n1:20:16.200 --> 1:20:18.800\n Let's talk about the National Enquirer.\n\n1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:21.400\n Is everything the National Enquirer says false?\n\n1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:23.640\n No.\n\n1:20:23.640 --> 1:20:25.200\n No.\n\n1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:27.400\n Okay, do you remember the John Edwards story?\n\n1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:30.080\n Did you cheat on his wife?\n\n1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:30.920\n Sorry.\n\n1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:33.120\n He had a child from an extramarital affair.\n\n1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:34.440\n Yes.\n\n1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:37.440\n I believe that the National Enquirer broke the story.\n\n1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:41.120\n And then what does the New York Times do?\n\n1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:43.880\n The New York Times, I think, is allowed to report\n\n1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:46.280\n that the National Enquirer is making a claim.\n\n1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:49.040\n That way they don't have to substantiate the story.\n\n1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:53.520\n So why is the New York Times talking to Mike Cernovich\n\n1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:56.160\n or using the National Enquirer as a source?\n\n1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:58.280\n Are they using Alex Jones as a source?\n\n1:20:59.840 --> 1:21:02.520\n Here's the big problem that we're having.\n\n1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:05.840\n Why are certain people entitled to talk to everybody\n\n1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:08.240\n and other people are entitled to talk to no one?\n\n1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:09.280\n I don't really understand this.\n\n1:21:09.280 --> 1:21:10.880\n This is an indulgence system.\n\n1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:13.280\n This is how the Catholic church used to do things.\n\n1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:15.520\n It's hard to fight the system because the reason\n\n1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:17.960\n you don't talk to Alex Jones is because the platforms\n\n1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:21.920\n on which we do the communication will deplatform.\n\n1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:23.160\n I'm not platform.\n\n1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:27.800\n I used to do NPR and I used to do the NewsHour\n\n1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:29.960\n and I used to provide stories\n\n1:21:29.960 --> 1:21:32.600\n to Washington Post, New York Times.\n\n1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:33.840\n That has gone away.\n\n1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:36.760\n They've circled the wagons closer and closer\n\n1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:38.840\n and more of us are unacceptable.\n\n1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:41.440\n And right now I have no question that they're going\n\n1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:45.160\n through anybody who has a platform trying to say,\n\n1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:46.760\n okay, what do we have against that person\n\n1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:48.720\n in case we need to shut that down?\n\n1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:51.040\n We have to make a different decision, Lex,\n\n1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:54.280\n and the different decision is that it doesn't matter\n\n1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:57.560\n how many times Joe said the N word.\n\n1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:01.360\n It doesn't matter that somebody else,\n\n1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.520\n with mathematical theorems, if the worst person\n\n1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:08.160\n in the world proves a mathematical theorem\n\n1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:11.360\n like the Unabomber, we can't undo the theorem.\n\n1:22:12.680 --> 1:22:15.640\n And I point out Charles Manson's song,\n\n1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:18.520\n Look at Your Game Girl is an amazing song.\n\n1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:19.560\n It's a really good song.\n\n1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:22.120\n I don't think it's one of the greatest songs ever,\n\n1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:24.360\n but it happens that he wasn't a no talent.\n\n1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:29.280\n And I don't know how Hitler was as an artist.\n\n1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:30.760\n Fiction, not bad.\n\n1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:33.720\n Okay, we've got to get past this.\n\n1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:35.480\n We've got to get past this idea\n\n1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:37.840\n that we're going to purge ourselves of our badness\n\n1:22:37.840 --> 1:22:40.040\n and we're just going to, this is like,\n\n1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:42.400\n I've likened it to teenage girls in cutting.\n\n1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:46.440\n We're just, all we're doing is destroying ourselves\n\n1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:47.800\n in search of perfection.\n\n1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:49.920\n And the answer is no, we're not perfect.\n\n1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:52.160\n We're flawed, we're screwed up.\n\n1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:53.480\n And we've always been this way.\n\n1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:55.360\n And we're not going to silence everyone\n\n1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:57.560\n who you can point a laser beam at\n\n1:22:57.560 --> 1:23:00.440\n and say, well, that person, look at how bad that person is.\n\n1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:03.720\n If we do that, kiss the whole thing goodbye.\n\n1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:05.880\n We might as well just, let's learn Chinese.\n\n1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:10.440\n But there is an art to having those messy conversations,\n\n1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:13.200\n whether with Alex or anybody else.\n\n1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:15.120\n Okay, let's talk about Alex.\n\n1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:16.960\n There's particular stuff that Alex does\n\n1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:19.120\n that's absolutely nauseating.\n\n1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:20.960\n And there's other stuff that he's doing that's funny.\n\n1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:23.160\n The methodology of the way he carries.\n\n1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:25.440\n And sometimes he's talking about the truth.\n\n1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:27.400\n And sometimes he's talking about a conspiracy.\n\n1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:30.360\n His variance is incredibly high.\n\n1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:33.240\n The right way to approach Alex Jones or James O. Keefe\n\n1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:36.160\n or the National Enquirer or anything you don't like\n\n1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:38.320\n is to say, great, go long short.\n\n1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:43.840\n Well, if you invest in a mutual fund,\n\n1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:46.840\n all the stocks in the mutual fund are held long.\n\n1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:48.880\n But if you invest in a hedge fund,\n\n1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:51.160\n you do something called relative value trade.\n\n1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:54.320\n It's like, well, you long tech or short tech?\n\n1:23:54.320 --> 1:23:58.160\n Well, actually I'm long Microsoft and I'm short Google.\n\n1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:00.280\n Why is that?\n\n1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:03.760\n Oh, because I believe Google got way too much attention\n\n1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:06.000\n and that Microsoft has been unfairly maligned.\n\n1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.760\n And so this is really a play on legacy tech\n\n1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:11.080\n over more modern tech, okay?\n\n1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.520\n Which part of Alex Jones are you long\n\n1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:15.600\n and which part are you short?\n\n1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:17.360\n One of the things that should be a requirement\n\n1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:18.560\n for being a reporter is like,\n\n1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:21.280\n what did Donald Trump do that was good?\n\n1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:22.720\n Right. Nothing.\n\n1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:25.160\n Okay, then you're not a reporter.\n\n1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:26.800\n What did Hitler do that was good?\n\n1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:31.400\n The Rosenstrasse of protest.\n\n1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:37.360\n Non Jewish women campaign for their Jewish men\n\n1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:39.240\n to be returned home to them\n\n1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:43.400\n from certain death almost in death camps.\n\n1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:45.880\n It should have been that there were no death camps.\n\n1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:48.760\n It should have been that everybody was returned home.\n\n1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:50.280\n But you know what?\n\n1:24:50.280 --> 1:24:53.640\n The fact that the women of the Rosenstrasse protest,\n\n1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:56.440\n I mean, sorry, I get very emotional about this.\n\n1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:58.640\n Some of the baddest ass chicks in the world\n\n1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:02.480\n got their husbands returned to them.\n\n1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.360\n Kolokavod.\n\n1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:08.800\n And not, I'm not celebrating Hitler.\n\n1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:11.720\n Hitler's the worst of the worst.\n\n1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:15.600\n But God damn it, this idea that we can just say\n\n1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:17.760\n everything that person does is a lie.\n\n1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:19.560\n Everything that person does is evil.\n\n1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:23.360\n This reflects a simplicity of mind\n\n1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.920\n that humanity cannot afford.\n\n1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:30.720\n Is Google evil because it will sell you Mein Kampf?\n\n1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:32.960\n Is Amazon evil because it will sell you Mein Kampf?\n\n1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:34.600\n If you find out that Mein Kampf\n\n1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:35.760\n rests on somebody's bookshelves,\n\n1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:37.520\n do you have any idea what it means?\n\n1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:41.400\n If you find out that a scholar use the N word,\n\n1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:43.120\n should that person lose their job?\n\n1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:44.840\n Come on.\n\n1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:47.520\n Grow the hell up.\n\n1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:50.840\n I guess our responsibility to lead by example in that,\n\n1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:53.520\n because you have to acknowledge that the fact,\n\n1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:55.360\n like the current public discourse.\n\n1:25:55.360 --> 1:25:58.360\n Have somebody on your podcast who you're worried about.\n\n1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:03.720\n But do it in a principled fashion.\n\n1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:08.480\n I mean, in other words, I'm not here to whitewash everything.\n\n1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:13.440\n On the other hand, if somebody makes some allegations,\n\n1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:16.280\n I don't know that I'm obligated\n\n1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:19.160\n to treat every set of allegations as if,\n\n1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:21.600\n no, how do you defend yourself against, no.\n\n1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:24.640\n Allegations are so cheap to make at this moment.\n\n1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:27.080\n Well, my standard, I don't know,\n\n1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:29.080\n maybe you could speak to it is,\n\n1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:31.800\n I don't care, like in the case of Alex Jones, for example,\n\n1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:35.280\n I don't, I'm willing to have a conversation\n\n1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:37.400\n with Alex Jones and people like him.\n\n1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:40.600\n If I know he's not going to try to manipulate me.\n\n1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:42.360\n Assume that he is gonna try to manipulate you.\n\n1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.320\n I can't, then we're not going to be two humans.\n\n1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:48.240\n Okay, but Lex, I want you to think well of me.\n\n1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:51.480\n I put on a jacket, I don't usually wear a jacket, okay?\n\n1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:53.320\n Thank you, Eric.\n\n1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:55.800\n All right, I'm trying to manipulate you.\n\n1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:59.240\n There's an entire field, no, there's an entire field\n\n1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:01.840\n that says that speech may be best thought of\n\n1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:04.160\n as an attempt to manipulate each other.\n\n1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:06.480\n This is too simplistic.\n\n1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:08.560\n Everything that we keep talking through.\n\n1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:10.040\n Yes.\n\n1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:11.560\n You know better than this.\n\n1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:15.720\n I disagree, I think there is ways,\n\n1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:18.320\n there's, of course, it's a gray area,\n\n1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:21.640\n but there is a threshold where your intent\n\n1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:25.360\n with which you come to a meeting, to an interaction,\n\n1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:29.160\n is one that is not one that's grounded\n\n1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:32.280\n in like a respect for a common humanity,\n\n1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:34.560\n like a love for each other, is deeply messy.\n\n1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:36.680\n If somebody is doing really bad stuff,\n\n1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:38.720\n I expect you to try to keep them\n\n1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:40.720\n from doing really bad stuff.\n\n1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.760\n But just keep in mind that when I was a younger man,\n\n1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:49.480\n I saw an amazing anti pornography documentary,\n\n1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.600\n and it was called Rate It X,\n\n1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:54.040\n and I don't know where it went,\n\n1:27:55.160 --> 1:27:57.840\n but the conceit of it was we're going to get\n\n1:27:57.840 --> 1:28:00.400\n some pornographers in front of a camera\n\n1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:02.040\n because they want to talk,\n\n1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:03.520\n and we're going to ask them about what they do\n\n1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:06.360\n for a living and why it's okay.\n\n1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:09.120\n No commentary.\n\n1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:13.960\n Okay.\n\n1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:16.080\n You could potentially,\n\n1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:18.040\n if you really think Alex Jones is the worst,\n\n1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:20.720\n and again, I'm not intimately familiar with him,\n\n1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:25.640\n you could decide to just let him talk.\n\n1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:29.800\n Just let him talk.\n\n1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:33.920\n Now, I have decided not to do that with particular people.\n\n1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:35.640\n I've spoken to Stefan Molyneux.\n\n1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:38.000\n Stefan Molyneux makes many good points,\n\n1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.720\n makes many bad points,\n\n1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:42.600\n and he makes many good points in bad ways,\n\n1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:43.920\n and I worry about it,\n\n1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:46.760\n and I don't feel that it's not my obligation\n\n1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:48.480\n to make sure that Stefan Molyneux\n\n1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:50.160\n has a voice on the portal.\n\n1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:55.200\n But I did stand up and say I didn't want him banned\n\n1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:56.360\n from social media,\n\n1:28:57.400 --> 1:28:59.120\n and I do think that a lot of the people\n\n1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:00.800\n who are being banned from social media\n\n1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:02.000\n were worried that they're right\n\n1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.920\n rather than that they're wrong.\n\n1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:07.000\n I certainly don't really think that I'm worried\n\n1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:10.840\n in some sense that some of the really wrong people\n\n1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:13.280\n are wrong, but if you look at, for example, Curtis Yarvin,\n\n1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:15.200\n there's a tremendous amount of interest.\n\n1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:17.680\n Is Eric going to speak to Curtis Yarvin?\n\n1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:20.360\n Curtis Yarvin says many interesting things,\n\n1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:23.920\n and he says many horrible, stupid things, very provocative.\n\n1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:28.480\n And I haven't invited him onto the portal,\n\n1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:32.160\n but I haven't said I will never invite him onto the portal.\n\n1:29:32.160 --> 1:29:35.080\n We are all in a difficult position.\n\n1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:35.920\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:37.360\n You're making it kind of,\n\n1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:39.920\n I think it's a much more difficult task\n\n1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:43.120\n and burden to carry as people who have conversations\n\n1:29:43.120 --> 1:29:46.200\n because Curtis Yarvin is a good example.\n\n1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:50.160\n How much work do I have to put in reading Curtis's work\n\n1:29:50.160 --> 1:29:51.480\n to really understand?\n\n1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.480\n We should talk about the problem of Curtis Yarvin,\n\n1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:55.640\n I think it's probably illustrative.\n\n1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.800\n There's this big question is why does somebody\n\n1:29:57.800 --> 1:30:00.440\n who says such stupid ass things listen to\n\n1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:01.920\n by so many people?\n\n1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.800\n Very smart people, people who are part of our daily lives\n\n1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:07.520\n discuss Curtis Yarvin in hushed tones.\n\n1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:09.120\n Now, it's a good question.\n\n1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:12.560\n My belief is that Curtis Yarvin has made a number\n\n1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:15.840\n of very interesting, provocative points,\n\n1:30:15.840 --> 1:30:18.840\n and they associate Curtis Yarvin as the person\n\n1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:20.520\n who has made these points,\n\n1:30:20.520 --> 1:30:23.520\n and they treat the completely asinine stuff\n\n1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:26.680\n that he says that's super dangerous as,\n\n1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:29.840\n well, that's Curtis, right?\n\n1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:31.720\n Right, they give him the credit for,\n\n1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:34.160\n he's a kind of like, sorry to use the term,\n\n1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:37.920\n first principles deep thinker about the way the world,\n\n1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:40.280\n in some space about the world.\n\n1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:43.160\n But as a result, we don't actually know\n\n1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:45.840\n why Curtis Yarvin is knocking around\n\n1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:50.840\n so many Silicon Valley luminaries lives.\n\n1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:54.480\n See, you said that he said a lot of asinine stupid stuff,\n\n1:30:54.480 --> 1:30:56.920\n and that's the sense I got from a few things I've read,\n\n1:30:56.920 --> 1:31:00.000\n not just about, this is not just like Wikipedia stuff,\n\n1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:03.160\n is he's a little, like I've said before,\n\n1:31:03.160 --> 1:31:05.760\n he seems to be careless.\n\n1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:09.100\n I don't think he's, no, no, no, it's like Jim Watson.\n\n1:31:09.100 --> 1:31:12.360\n Jim Watson wants to say very provocative things\n\n1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:14.600\n in order to prove that he's free.\n\n1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:15.840\n It's not a question of careless.\n\n1:31:15.840 --> 1:31:20.560\n He enjoys the freedom to say these things.\n\n1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:22.320\n And the key point is, is that there's,\n\n1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:25.440\n I expect something more of Curtis.\n\n1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:27.880\n I expect that if somebody is insightful\n\n1:31:27.880 --> 1:31:30.180\n about all sorts of things up to that point,\n\n1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:33.280\n that they're going to have enough care.\n\n1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:35.400\n Now, I, for example, make this point repeatedly\n\n1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:38.160\n that vaccines are not 100% safe.\n\n1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:41.000\n Most people who have an idea that anybody\n\n1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:44.720\n who's an anti vaxxer should be silenced are in a position\n\n1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:48.040\n where they probably don't say vaccines are 100% safe,\n\n1:31:48.040 --> 1:31:50.320\n but you keep finding that statement over and over again,\n\n1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:53.360\n like believe all women, vaccines are 100% safe,\n\n1:31:53.360 --> 1:31:55.760\n climate science is settled science.\n\n1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:57.500\n Whatever this Mont and Bailey is,\n\n1:31:57.500 --> 1:32:02.500\n where you make extraordinarily vapid blanket claims,\n\n1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:04.280\n and then you retreat into something,\n\n1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:07.160\n well, defund the, we don't want no more police,\n\n1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:11.520\n actually just means we want the police to not take\n\n1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:12.860\n on mental health duties.\n\n1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:17.640\n We've come up with an incredibly disingenuous society.\n\n1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:21.120\n And what I'm claiming is, is that I might talk\n\n1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:25.400\n to Curtis Yarvin, but I have really very little interest\n\n1:32:25.400 --> 1:32:28.280\n to talk to a guy who seems to be kind of giddy\n\n1:32:28.280 --> 1:32:31.480\n about who makes good slaves and who makes bad slaves.\n\n1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:34.280\n It's like, why do I want to do that on the portal?\n\n1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:37.840\n One, first of all, because just as you said,\n\n1:32:37.840 --> 1:32:39.680\n that's not Curtis's main thing.\n\n1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:43.760\n He has a lot of ideas and what I've read of him,\n\n1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:48.160\n which is not a huge amount, is he's very thoughtful\n\n1:32:48.160 --> 1:32:50.500\n about the way this world works.\n\n1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:54.620\n And on top of that, he's an important historical figure\n\n1:32:54.620 --> 1:32:57.880\n in the birth and the development of the alt right,\n\n1:32:57.880 --> 1:32:59.320\n or what would be called the alt right.\n\n1:32:59.320 --> 1:33:00.440\n Or the new reactionary.\n\n1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:01.800\n Yeah, and there's,\n\n1:33:01.800 --> 1:33:05.520\n so he's just an important intellectual.\n\n1:33:05.520 --> 1:33:07.400\n And so it makes sense to talk to him.\n\n1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:10.860\n The question is, how much work do you put in?\n\n1:33:10.860 --> 1:33:12.760\n Well, this is the issue of fugu.\n\n1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:16.460\n I'm not a chef that necessarily can serve that fugu.\n\n1:33:18.420 --> 1:33:21.560\n So you have a puffer fish, you can eat the puffer fish.\n\n1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:25.080\n You can get kind of a tingly sensation on your tongue\n\n1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:27.120\n if you get a little bit of the poison organ.\n\n1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:30.780\n But my point is, I don't know how to serve Curtis Yarvin\n\n1:33:30.780 --> 1:33:34.280\n so that, in fact, I'm not worried about what happens.\n\n1:33:34.280 --> 1:33:37.280\n And I believe that if somebody else was a student\n\n1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.360\n of the new reactionary movement,\n\n1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:41.400\n that person might be in a better position\n\n1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:42.980\n to host Curtis Yarvin.\n\n1:33:42.980 --> 1:33:44.800\n So somebody, that's a really good example,\n\n1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:49.240\n somebody I think you've spoken with that's an intermediary,\n\n1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:50.840\n that's a powerful one, is Michael Malice.\n\n1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:52.700\n And he's spoken with Curtis Yarvin.\n\n1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:55.040\n And Michael wrote a book about.\n\n1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:57.040\n By the way, Michael somewhat changed my mind\n\n1:33:57.040 --> 1:33:58.640\n about Michael Malice.\n\n1:33:58.640 --> 1:33:59.720\n I'm glad he did.\n\n1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:02.680\n I think, I would call him a friend,\n\n1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:05.680\n and I think he's underneath it all\n\n1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:08.680\n a really kind human being.\n\n1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:11.080\n And I think your skepticism about him was initially\n\n1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:13.440\n from a surface level of, what did you call him,\n\n1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:15.880\n hyenas, the trolls, and so on.\n\n1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.520\n I'm not happy about his.\n\n1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:23.180\n It's been so long since I've seen good trolls.\n\n1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:24.020\n Yes.\n\n1:34:24.020 --> 1:34:24.860\n So.\n\n1:34:24.860 --> 1:34:28.840\n He needs a higher quality of trolling.\n\n1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:30.320\n But he aspires to that.\n\n1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:33.840\n I mean, disagree or not,\n\n1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:38.100\n I really enjoy how much care he puts\n\n1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:40.680\n into the work he does, like on North Korea\n\n1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:42.240\n and the study of the world,\n\n1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:45.780\n and how much privately, but also in public,\n\n1:34:45.780 --> 1:34:50.260\n love he has for people, especially those who are powerless.\n\n1:34:50.260 --> 1:34:53.180\n Just a genuine admiration for them.\n\n1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:57.280\n I think Curtis actually.\n\n1:34:57.280 --> 1:34:58.120\n Does too.\n\n1:34:58.120 --> 1:34:59.040\n I don't know.\n\n1:34:59.040 --> 1:34:59.960\n I mean, you have to appreciate,\n\n1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:02.400\n the first time I met Curtis, he introduced me,\n\n1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:05.560\n he says, I'm the most right wing person you've ever met.\n\n1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:06.640\n I was just like, well,\n\n1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:09.160\n this is a conversation that's already over.\n\n1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:12.800\n It's theatrical in a way that's not conducted\n\n1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:14.680\n to actually having a real human connection.\n\n1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:18.120\n It turned me off because it was like,\n\n1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:19.960\n you need to be the most right wing person.\n\n1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:22.520\n And so it's like, I'm a troll, I'm a troll.\n\n1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:24.340\n Okay, why are we doing this?\n\n1:35:24.340 --> 1:35:25.960\n But what I'm trying to get at is different.\n\n1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:29.160\n I'm trying to say that Michael Malice is a friend of yours.\n\n1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:31.560\n If you found out something terrible,\n\n1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:32.680\n you should still be a friend.\n\n1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:34.600\n You should still continue to be his friend.\n\n1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:36.520\n And in Michael Malice's case,\n\n1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:38.640\n it's very likely that we'll find out something terrible.\n\n1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:40.200\n Curtis is an acquaintance of mine\n\n1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:42.640\n because he hangs around with some people that I know.\n\n1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:44.360\n I did not get it.\n\n1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:47.400\n I've started to understand why the people in my life,\n\n1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:51.000\n some of them are Curtis Yarvin fans.\n\n1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:54.000\n Many of them disregard the stupid stuff.\n\n1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:58.000\n But my feeling is that too much poison organ,\n\n1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:59.400\n not enough fish.\n\n1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:00.480\n I don't know how to serve that.\n\n1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:01.320\n It's too intermingled.\n\n1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:02.920\n I'm not your chef.\n\n1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:04.760\n Speaking for defending your friends,\n\n1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:06.680\n staying with your friends,\n\n1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:10.600\n and bringing the old band together again,\n\n1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:14.320\n you coined the term IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.\n\n1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:16.480\n I like it.\n\n1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:19.200\n It represents a certain group of people\n\n1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:22.000\n that are struggling with,\n\n1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:26.640\n that are almost like challenged the norms\n\n1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:29.400\n of social and political discourse\n\n1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.760\n from all different angles.\n\n1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:33.840\n What do you think is the state of the IDW?\n\n1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:35.560\n What do you think is its future?\n\n1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:39.040\n Is it still a useful?\n\n1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:40.120\n Well, it never exists.\n\n1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:41.360\n Is it a protocol?\n\n1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:44.040\n Is it a collection of people featured in an article?\n\n1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:46.080\n What I learned very clearly\n\n1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:49.040\n is that there's a tremendous desire in the internet age\n\n1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:50.080\n to pin people down.\n\n1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:50.920\n Well, what do you say?\n\n1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:51.760\n Who's in it?\n\n1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:53.240\n What are the criteria?\n\n1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:55.520\n It's like, I understand.\n\n1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:57.280\n You wanna play the demarcation game\n\n1:36:57.280 --> 1:36:59.800\n and you wanna make everything that is demarcated\n\n1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:01.560\n instantly null and void.\n\n1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:02.800\n No, thank you.\n\n1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:06.160\n So I resisted saying who was in it.\n\n1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:07.800\n I resisted saying what it was.\n\n1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:10.320\n I resisted saying that Barry Weiss's article\n\n1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:11.720\n was the definitive thing.\n\n1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.080\n They chose a ridiculous concept for the photographs\n\n1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:18.360\n that we couldn't get out of.\n\n1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:20.480\n I did not want those photographs taken.\n\n1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:23.080\n They decided that the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer\n\n1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:25.280\n needed to take them all at twilight.\n\n1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:27.480\n I don't know, some such thing.\n\n1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:29.880\n I didn't even necessarily wanna do the article.\n\n1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:32.280\n Barry convinced me that it was the right thing to do.\n\n1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:33.600\n Undoubtedly Barry was right.\n\n1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:35.040\n I was wrong.\n\n1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:40.040\n But the key point is nothing can grow in this environment.\n\n1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:43.240\n There's a reason we're not building.\n\n1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:46.080\n It does not appear that we found a way\n\n1:37:46.920 --> 1:37:49.480\n to grow anything organic and good and decent\n\n1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:50.960\n that we need right now.\n\n1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:52.920\n And that's kind of the key issue.\n\n1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:53.760\n Who's the we?\n\n1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:55.200\n Do you mean us as a society?\n\n1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:57.600\n Those of us who wish to have a future\n\n1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:59.160\n for our great grandchildren.\n\n1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:02.520\n Let's take the subset of people who are worried\n\n1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:04.600\n about things long after their demise.\n\n1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:09.960\n But do you think it's useful to have a term like the IDW\n\n1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:13.080\n to capture some set of people,\n\n1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:17.680\n some set of ideas\n\n1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:21.760\n or maybe principles that capture what I think the IDW,\n\n1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:23.960\n okay, you can say it's not supposed to mean,\n\n1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:25.720\n it doesn't exist, it doesn't mean anything,\n\n1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:29.200\n but to the public, to me, okay, I'll just speak to me,\n\n1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:30.560\n it represented something.\n\n1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:31.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:34.520\n It represented, I think I just said this to you,\n\n1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:39.520\n in my first attempt to interview the great Eric Weinstein,\n\n1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:42.040\n I said that, I spoke this about you,\n\n1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:44.800\n but IDW in general is trying to point out the elephant\n\n1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:46.720\n in the room or that the emperor has no clothes.\n\n1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:49.440\n The set of people that do that in their own way.\n\n1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:52.160\n If there are multiple elephants in the room,\n\n1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:54.560\n the point is that the IDW was more interested\n\n1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:56.840\n in seeing the totality of elephants\n\n1:38:56.840 --> 1:38:59.200\n and trying to figure out how do we move forward\n\n1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:01.440\n as opposed to saying I can spot the other guy's elephant\n\n1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:03.680\n in the room, but I can't see my own.\n\n1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:05.560\n And in large measure,\n\n1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:09.920\n we didn't represent an institutional base.\n\n1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:12.440\n And therefore it wasn't maximally important\n\n1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:13.880\n that we look at our own hypocrisy\n\n1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:18.640\n because we weren't on the institutional spectrum.\n\n1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:20.480\n This is where friendship comes into play\n\n1:39:20.480 --> 1:39:21.520\n with the different figures\n\n1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:24.320\n that are loosely associated with IDW\n\n1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:29.320\n is you were somehow responsible for the exact thing\n\n1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:35.240\n that you said, did you hear what, I don't know,\n\n1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:39.400\n I forget, oh, what Sam Harris said about IDW.\n\n1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:40.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:40.720 --> 1:39:41.760\n That kind of thing is.\n\n1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:42.600\n I chuckled.\n\n1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:46.360\n Lovingly or chuckle like, oh.\n\n1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:49.360\n I was angry at some people who had said things\n\n1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:51.240\n that caused Sam to say what Sam said\n\n1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.840\n about turning his imaginary club membership into the IDW.\n\n1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:58.160\n People said very silly things.\n\n1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:01.760\n And I think that there is just this confusion\n\n1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:06.120\n that integrity means calling out your friends\n\n1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:08.360\n in front of the world.\n\n1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:12.280\n And I've been pretty clear about this.\n\n1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:13.880\n I try to choose my friends carefully.\n\n1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:16.240\n And if you would like to recuse me\n\n1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:18.720\n because I'm not a source of reliable information,\n\n1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:20.520\n people that I know and love the most,\n\n1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:23.920\n maybe that's reasonable for you.\n\n1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:25.680\n Maybe you prefer somebody who was willing\n\n1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:27.400\n to throw a friend under the bus\n\n1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:29.160\n at the first sign of trouble.\n\n1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:31.600\n By all means, exit my feed.\n\n1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.000\n You don't have to subscribe to me.\n\n1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.960\n If that's your concept of integrity,\n\n1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:38.800\n you're barking up the wrong tree.\n\n1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:41.280\n What I will say is that I knew these people well enough\n\n1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:42.960\n to know that they're all flawed.\n\n1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:46.800\n Thank you for the callback.\n\n1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:51.800\n But the issue is that I love people who are flawed.\n\n1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:55.720\n And I love people who have to earn a living,\n\n1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:57.040\n even if you call them a grifter.\n\n1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:01.480\n And I love people who like the fact\n\n1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:03.520\n that Donald Trump didn't get us into new wars,\n\n1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:05.600\n even if you call them alt right.\n\n1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:09.640\n I love the fact that some people believe\n\n1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:12.520\n in structural oppression and wanna fight it,\n\n1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:14.600\n even if they're not woke,\n\n1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:16.400\n because they don't believe that structural oppression\n\n1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:17.440\n is hiding everywhere.\n\n1:41:19.040 --> 1:41:21.760\n I care and love different people in different ways.\n\n1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:24.400\n And I think that the overarching thing, Lex,\n\n1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:26.160\n that we're not getting at is that\n\n1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:28.640\n we were sold a bill of goods\n\n1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:33.360\n that you can go through life like an ELISA program\n\n1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:35.640\n with pre programmed responses.\n\n1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:39.880\n Well, it's what about ism, it's both sides ism,\n\n1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:44.040\n it's alt right, it's the loony left, it's campus madness.\n\n1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:46.600\n It's like, okay, why don't you just empty\n\n1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:49.360\n the entire goddamn magazine?\n\n1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:56.160\n All of those pre recorded snips.\n\n1:41:57.600 --> 1:41:59.440\n Now that you've done all of that,\n\n1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:02.240\n now we can have a conversation.\n\n1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:07.240\n Your son put it really well, which is we should,\n\n1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:09.960\n in all things, resist labels.\n\n1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.960\n But we can't deal without labels, we have to generalize.\n\n1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:17.680\n But we also have to keep in mind\n\n1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:19.560\n that just in the way in science,\n\n1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:20.880\n you deal with an effective theory\n\n1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:22.360\n that isn't a fundamental one.\n\n1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:25.400\n In science, most of our theories,\n\n1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:27.360\n we consider to be effective theories.\n\n1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:32.040\n If I generalize about Europe, about women,\n\n1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:37.040\n about Christians, those things have to be understood\n\n1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:42.400\n to mean something and not to have their definitions\n\n1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:46.840\n extend so broadly that they mean nothing at all,\n\n1:42:46.840 --> 1:42:51.240\n nor that they're so rigid that they're claims\n\n1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:53.180\n that clearly won't bear scrutiny.\n\n1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:56.560\n Lex, what do you really wanna talk about?\n\n1:42:56.560 --> 1:42:58.480\n That's always my question to you.\n\n1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:02.120\n That always gets me, maybe you are the therapist.\n\n1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:04.520\n But you and I could talk about anything.\n\n1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:07.240\n People love, up until now at least,\n\n1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:08.600\n people have loved listening\n\n1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:10.680\n to the two of us in conversation.\n\n1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:13.120\n And my feeling is is that we're not talking\n\n1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:17.600\n about neural nets, and we're not talking\n\n1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:20.360\n about geometric unity, and we're not talking\n\n1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:23.600\n about where distributed computing might go.\n\n1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:25.800\n And I don't think that we're really focused\n\n1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:29.520\n on some of the most exciting things\n\n1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:30.960\n we could do to transform education.\n\n1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:34.520\n We're still caught in this world of other people\n\n1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:36.040\n that we don't belong in.\n\n1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:38.480\n I don't belong in the world as it's been created.\n\n1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:39.820\n I'm trying to build a new world,\n\n1:43:39.820 --> 1:43:44.120\n and I'm astounded that the people\n\n1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:46.600\n with the independent means to help build that world\n\n1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:49.800\n are so demotivated that they don't wanna\n\n1:43:49.800 --> 1:43:50.980\n build new structures.\n\n1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:54.360\n And the people who do wanna build new structures\n\n1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:56.160\n seem to be wild eyed.\n\n1:43:56.160 --> 1:43:58.080\n Wild eyed, what do you mean by wild eyed?\n\n1:43:58.080 --> 1:43:59.120\n They're not, they're not.\n\n1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:01.120\n I guarantee you that I will get some message\n\n1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:03.340\n in my DMs that says, hey, Eric.\n\n1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:06.520\n You know, I'm a third year chemistry student\n\n1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:11.480\n at South Dakota State, and I've got a great idea.\n\n1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:12.480\n I just need funding.\n\n1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:13.320\n I wanna build.\n\n1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:14.400\n They don't have the means.\n\n1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:16.440\n So the people who have the means have become.\n\n1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:19.000\n Or the sophistication, it's like you're looking\n\n1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.280\n for somebody who's proven themselves a few times\n\n1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:24.960\n to say, you know, I've got $4 billion behind me\n\n1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:27.840\n that's soft circled.\n\n1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:30.800\n I wanna figure out what a new university would be\n\n1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:33.400\n and what it would take to protect academic freedom\n\n1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:34.340\n and who we would hire\n\n1:44:34.340 --> 1:44:36.400\n and what are the different characteristics\n\n1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:37.960\n because I can clearly see that everything\n\n1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:40.020\n following the current model is falling apart.\n\n1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:43.440\n Nobody in my understanding is saying that.\n\n1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:47.600\n Nobody is saying let's take that\n\n1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:51.040\n which is functioning independently\n\n1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:53.360\n and make it less vulnerable.\n\n1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:55.920\n Let's boost those signals.\n\n1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:58.920\n And a critical component as money, you think?\n\n1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:01.580\n It's not only that, but it's also a kind of\n\n1:45:01.580 --> 1:45:04.040\n these people are mobbed up hands off.\n\n1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:08.500\n Let's imagine for the moment that Sundar Pichai,\n\n1:45:08.500 --> 1:45:10.520\n Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg\n\n1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:17.760\n founded a university come social media entity.\n\n1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:20.760\n And they said, the purpose of this is to make sure\n\n1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:23.160\n that academic freedom will not perish from this earth\n\n1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:26.520\n because it's necessary to keep us from all going crazy.\n\n1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:29.440\n And we are going to lock ourselves out.\n\n1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:32.240\n We've come up with this governance system.\n\n1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:35.760\n And the idea is that these people will be assigned\n\n1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:38.200\n the difficult task of making sure that society\n\n1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:40.360\n doesn't go crazy in any particular direction.\n\n1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:43.080\n That we have a fact based, reality based,\n\n1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:46.320\n feasibility based, understaffed,\n\n1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:48.360\n theory based understanding.\n\n1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:51.540\n We can try to figure out where our real opportunities are.\n\n1:45:53.900 --> 1:45:56.960\n It feels like everybody with the ability\n\n1:45:56.960 --> 1:45:58.360\n to do something like that,\n\n1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:01.600\n and with the brains and experience and the resources,\n\n1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:05.400\n would rather sit in the current system\n\n1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:08.440\n and hope to figure out where they can flee to\n\n1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:10.200\n if the whole thing comes apart.\n\n1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:12.500\n Well, yeah, and maybe to push back in a little bit,\n\n1:46:12.500 --> 1:46:14.440\n I agree with you, but you know,\n\n1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:17.560\n it feels like some people are trying that.\n\n1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:21.400\n So for example, Google purchased DeepMind.\n\n1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:23.600\n DeepMind is a company that kind of represents\n\n1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:25.360\n a lot of radical ideas.\n\n1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:27.800\n They've become acceptable, actually.\n\n1:46:27.800 --> 1:46:30.120\n AGI, artificial general intelligence,\n\n1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:35.120\n used to be really radical of a thing to talk about.\n\n1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:38.160\n And DeepMind and OpenAI are two places\n\n1:46:38.160 --> 1:46:39.800\n which has made it more acceptable.\n\n1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:43.880\n I know you can now start to criticize,\n\n1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:46.600\n well, they're really, now that it's become acceptable,\n\n1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:48.000\n they're not taking the further step\n\n1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:49.220\n of being more and more radical.\n\n1:46:49.220 --> 1:46:51.360\n But you know, that wasn't an attempt by Google\n\n1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:56.360\n to say that let's try some wild stuff.\n\n1:46:57.600 --> 1:46:59.340\n Sort of like Boston Dynamics.\n\n1:46:59.340 --> 1:47:01.520\n Sort of like Boston Dynamics.\n\n1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:04.040\n Boston Dynamics is a really good example\n\n1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:09.040\n of trying radical ideas for perhaps no purpose whatsoever\n\n1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:13.160\n except to try out their ideas.\n\n1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:16.720\n Well, the idea is that innovation is like dessert.\n\n1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:20.800\n You can have dessert after you solve the problem\n\n1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:22.440\n of the main course, and the main course\n\n1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:24.840\n is a bunch of insoluble problems.\n\n1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:27.560\n So the idea is we can get into innovation\n\n1:47:27.560 --> 1:47:29.840\n once we perfect ourselves.\n\n1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:32.440\n And you're saying that we need to make innovation\n\n1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:33.480\n the main meal.\n\n1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:37.000\n Well, I'm saying that there really is structural oppression.\n\n1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:44.000\n I mean, if you train a deep learning system\n\n1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:47.940\n on exclusively white faces, it's gonna get confused.\n\n1:47:47.940 --> 1:47:51.440\n So let's not disagree that there are real issues\n\n1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:52.280\n around this.\n\n1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:55.480\n In fact, that's an issue of innovation and data.\n\n1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:57.920\n Your data should be responsive.\n\n1:47:57.920 --> 1:47:59.360\n On the other hand, there are things\n\n1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:04.040\n we can't do anything about that are actually fundamental.\n\n1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:08.760\n And those things may have to do with the fact\n\n1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:13.440\n that some of us taste cilantro as soap,\n\n1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:14.920\n and some of us don't.\n\n1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:16.880\n Like there are differences between people,\n\n1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:18.720\n and some of them are in the hardware,\n\n1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:19.760\n some of them are in the firmware,\n\n1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.520\n some of them are in the software that is the human mind.\n\n1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:27.000\n And this completely simplistic idea\n\n1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:32.000\n that every failure of an organization\n\n1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.360\n to promote each person\n\n1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:37.160\n who has particular intersexual characteristics,\n\n1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.320\n we cannot hold progress hostage to that.\n\n1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:45.760\n And you've talked about, perhaps we'll save this\n\n1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:47.920\n for another time because it's such a fascinating conversation.\n\n1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:51.520\n You talked about this with Glenn Beck,\n\n1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:53.600\n is the whole sort of stagnation of growth\n\n1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:54.480\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:59.480\n Your idea is that in as much as the current situation\n\n1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:01.720\n is a kind of Ponzi scheme,\n\n1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:03.760\n the current situation in the United States\n\n1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:06.840\n is a kind of Ponzi scheme built on the promise\n\n1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:10.120\n of constant unending innovation,\n\n1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:15.120\n we need to fund the true innovators\n\n1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:21.920\n and encourage them and empower them\n\n1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:23.880\n and sort of culturally say that this is what\n\n1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:27.400\n this country is about is the brilliant minds.\n\n1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:31.320\n We're gonna kill each other if we don't grow.\n\n1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:33.240\n Growth is like an immune system\n\n1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:36.600\n and you always have pathogens present,\n\n1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:37.800\n but if you don't have growth present,\n\n1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:40.080\n you can't fight the pathogens in your society.\n\n1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:43.600\n And right now the pathogens are spreading everywhere.\n\n1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:46.880\n So if we don't get growth into our system fairly quickly,\n\n1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:49.640\n we are in really seriously bad shape.\n\n1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:54.520\n So it's very important that if I had a horrible person\n\n1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:56.440\n who was capable of building something\n\n1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:59.000\n that would give us all a certain amount\n\n1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:00.840\n of what I've called financial beta\n\n1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:03.720\n to some new technology where we all benefit,\n\n1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:05.320\n let's say quantum computing comes in\n\n1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:07.320\n and everybody, the dry cleaner\n\n1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:09.760\n has a quantum computing angle, right?\n\n1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:10.680\n Yes. Okay.\n\n1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:15.520\n That's necessary to keep this system that we built going.\n\n1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:17.400\n We can try to redesign the system,\n\n1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:19.240\n but our system expects growth\n\n1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:21.120\n and we've started it for growth\n\n1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:23.040\n and the madness that we're seeing\n\n1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:24.760\n is the failure of our immune system\n\n1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:26.200\n to be able to handle the pathogens\n\n1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:28.280\n that have always been present.\n\n1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:30.440\n So people can say, well, this was always there.\n\n1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:31.280\n Yes, it was.\n\n1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:33.040\n What's changed was your immune system.\n\n1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:37.960\n We have got to make sure that one,\n\n1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.960\n we understand why diversity\n\n1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:41.640\n is potentially really important.\n\n1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:45.240\n We have mined certain communities to death.\n\n1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:47.440\n You and I are Ashkenazi Jews.\n\n1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:49.560\n Everyone knows that Ashkenazi Jews\n\n1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:51.000\n are good at technical stuff.\n\n1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:54.600\n We know that the Chinese are good at technical stuff.\n\n1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:56.120\n The Indians have many people\n\n1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.600\n who are good at technical stuff as the Japanese.\n\n1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:02.960\n So I also believe that we have communities\n\n1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:05.520\n where if you think about the Pareto idea\n\n1:51:05.520 --> 1:51:06.840\n of diminishing returns,\n\n1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:08.840\n if you've never mined a community,\n\n1:51:09.720 --> 1:51:11.360\n many of the people you're gonna get at the beginning\n\n1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:13.840\n are gonna be amazing because that community,\n\n1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:16.600\n it's like, did you drill for more oil in Texas?\n\n1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:19.080\n Texas is pretty thoroughly picked over.\n\n1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:23.040\n Do you find someplace that's completely insane?\n\n1:51:23.040 --> 1:51:24.840\n Maybe there's oil there, who knows?\n\n1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:29.840\n And in particular, I would like to displace our reliance\n\n1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.200\n on our military competitors in Asia\n\n1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:35.360\n in our scientific laboratories with women,\n\n1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:38.000\n with African Americans, with Latinos,\n\n1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.640\n people who are in different categories\n\n1:51:40.640 --> 1:51:42.040\n than we have traditionally sourced.\n\n1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:44.160\n And I would like to get them the money\n\n1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:48.080\n that the market would normally give these fields\n\n1:51:48.080 --> 1:51:52.560\n were we not using visas in place of payment, right?\n\n1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:57.080\n Now, I have a crazy idea,\n\n1:51:57.080 --> 1:51:59.800\n which is that I play, you and I both play music,\n\n1:51:59.800 --> 1:52:02.400\n and I find the analytic work that I do\n\n1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:04.200\n when I'm trying to figure out chord progressions\n\n1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:06.600\n and symmetries and tritones, all these sorts of things\n\n1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.080\n to be very similar to the work that I do\n\n1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:09.400\n when I do physics or math.\n\n1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:13.800\n I believe that one of the things that is true\n\n1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:17.560\n is that the analytic contributions of African Americans\n\n1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:20.120\n to music are probably fungible to science.\n\n1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:23.640\n I don't know that that's true.\n\n1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:26.400\n It's true I haven't done controlled research,\n\n1:52:26.400 --> 1:52:28.320\n but I believe that it is very important\n\n1:52:28.320 --> 1:52:31.080\n to let the People's Republic of China know\n\n1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:34.600\n that they are not staffing our laboratories anymore,\n\n1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:36.840\n and that we need to look to our own people.\n\n1:52:36.840 --> 1:52:39.880\n And in particular, we are going to get a huge benefit\n\n1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:44.880\n for making sure that women, Black Americans, Latinos\n\n1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:49.520\n are in a position to take over some of these things\n\n1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:52.840\n because many of these communities have been underutilized.\n\n1:52:52.840 --> 1:52:55.200\n Now, I don't know if that's an insane idea.\n\n1:52:55.200 --> 1:52:58.520\n I want to hear somebody tell me why it's an insane idea,\n\n1:52:58.520 --> 1:53:00.760\n but I believe that part of what we need to do\n\n1:53:00.760 --> 1:53:03.920\n is we need to recognize that there are security issues,\n\n1:53:03.920 --> 1:53:07.320\n there are geopolitical issues with the funding of science,\n\n1:53:07.320 --> 1:53:10.520\n and that what we've done is we've starved our world\n\n1:53:10.520 --> 1:53:12.360\n for innovation, and if we don't get back\n\n1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:13.480\n to the business of innovation,\n\n1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:15.640\n we should be doing diversity and inclusion\n\n1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:18.040\n out of greed rather than guilt.\n\n1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:20.360\n Now, part of the problem with this\n\n1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:23.880\n is that a lot of the energy behind diversity and inclusion\n\n1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:26.960\n is based on guilt and accusation.\n\n1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:30.800\n And what I want is I want to kick ass,\n\n1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:33.960\n and my hope is that diminishing returns favors\n\n1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:37.640\n mining the communities that have not been traditionally mined\n\n1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:41.960\n in order to extract output from those communities,\n\n1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:43.440\n unless there's a flaw in that plan.\n\n1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:45.200\n If there's a flaw, somebody needs to tell me.\n\n1:53:45.200 --> 1:53:48.600\n If there isn't a flaw, we need to get greedy\n\n1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:51.600\n about innovation rather than guilty about innovation.\n\n1:53:51.600 --> 1:53:53.400\n That's really brilliantly put.\n\n1:53:53.400 --> 1:53:55.320\n My biggest problem with what I see\n\n1:53:55.320 --> 1:53:59.720\n is it exactly speaks to that in the discussion of diversity.\n\n1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:02.200\n It's used, when it's grounded in guilt,\n\n1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:05.480\n it's then used as a hammer to shame people\n\n1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:06.880\n that don't care about diversity enough.\n\n1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:09.520\n F that shit, okay?\n\n1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:13.320\n So my point is I'm excited about the idea\n\n1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:15.880\n of Jimi Hendrix doing quantum field theory.\n\n1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:19.360\n I'm excited about the idea of Art Tatum\n\n1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:24.360\n trying to figure out what the neural nets\n\n1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:26.600\n figured out about protein folding.\n\n1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:29.240\n I have some idea of the level of intellect\n\n1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.320\n of people who have not found their way into STEM subjects\n\n1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:35.240\n in incredibly technically demanding areas.\n\n1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:37.760\n And if there's a flaw in that theory,\n\n1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:40.080\n I want somebody to present the flaw.\n\n1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:43.400\n But right now, my belief is that\n\n1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:45.880\n these things are merit based.\n\n1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:48.600\n And if you really believe in structural oppression,\n\n1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:51.360\n you do not want an affirmative action program.\n\n1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:53.640\n You wanna make sure that people have huge amounts\n\n1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:56.680\n of resources to get themselves into position.\n\n1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:58.160\n I wanna push out,\n\n1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:01.000\n I just tried this on this Clubhouse application.\n\n1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:04.560\n I wanna push out Klein bottles as a secret sign\n\n1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:07.520\n inside of rap videos in hip hop, right?\n\n1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:09.120\n I want people to have an idea\n\n1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.480\n that there's an amazing world.\n\n1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:12.960\n And I wanna get the people who,\n\n1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:16.640\n hopefully I'm trying to lure into science and engineering.\n\n1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:18.200\n I want to get them paid.\n\n1:55:18.200 --> 1:55:20.840\n I don't want them as the cheap substitutes\n\n1:55:20.840 --> 1:55:25.440\n for the fleeing white males who've learned\n\n1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:29.240\n that they can't make any money in science and engineering.\n\n1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:34.240\n So the problem is that we need to take over the ship Lex.\n\n1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:36.200\n And it doesn't need to be you and me\n\n1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:38.880\n because quite honestly, I have no desire to administer.\n\n1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:41.200\n I don't wanna be the chief executive officer of anything.\n\n1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:44.480\n What I do want is I want the baby boomers\n\n1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:48.960\n who've made this mess and can't see it to be gone.\n\n1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:51.840\n They had almost all of our universities\n\n1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:56.040\n and I want fresh blood, fresh resources.\n\n1:55:56.040 --> 1:56:00.600\n I want academic freedom and I want greed for our country\n\n1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:03.840\n and for the future to determine diversity inclusion\n\n1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:05.120\n as opposed to shame and guilt,\n\n1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:06.780\n which is destroying our fabric.\n\n1:56:06.780 --> 1:56:11.700\n That's as good of a diversity statement as I've ever heard.\n\n1:56:13.220 --> 1:56:17.580\n This is a U turn, but somebody commented on the tweet\n\n1:56:17.580 --> 1:56:20.900\n you sent that as one of the top comments,\n\n1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:24.180\n they definitely have to ask you about cryptocurrency.\n\n1:56:24.180 --> 1:56:27.540\n So it's a U turn, but not really.\n\n1:56:27.540 --> 1:56:29.960\n Since you're an economist, since you're deep,\n\n1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:31.340\n not an economist.\n\n1:56:31.340 --> 1:56:33.740\n I mean, I pretend to be an economist,\n\n1:56:33.740 --> 1:56:36.980\n hoping that the economists will take issue\n\n1:56:36.980 --> 1:56:39.280\n that I'm not an economist so that I can advance\n\n1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:41.940\n gauge theoretic and field theoretic economics,\n\n1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:45.500\n which the economics profession has failed to acknowledge\n\n1:56:45.500 --> 1:56:46.900\n was a major innovation\n\n1:56:46.900 --> 1:56:49.700\n that happened approximately 25 years ago.\n\n1:56:49.700 --> 1:56:51.560\n I don't think that economists understand\n\n1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:53.740\n what a price index is that measures inflation,\n\n1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:58.180\n nor do I think economists understand what a growth index\n\n1:56:58.180 --> 1:57:03.180\n or a product, a quantity index is that measures GDP.\n\n1:57:04.180 --> 1:57:07.700\n I think that they don't even understand the basics\n\n1:57:07.700 --> 1:57:10.620\n of price and quantity index construction.\n\n1:57:10.620 --> 1:57:15.100\n And therefore they can't possibly review\n\n1:57:16.100 --> 1:57:17.460\n field theoretic economics.\n\n1:57:17.460 --> 1:57:19.740\n They can't review gauge theoretic economics.\n\n1:57:19.740 --> 1:57:21.840\n They're intellectually not in a position\n\n1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:23.260\n to manage their own field.\n\n1:57:23.260 --> 1:57:25.220\n You talked about that there's a stagnation\n\n1:57:25.220 --> 1:57:26.660\n in growth currently.\n\n1:57:26.660 --> 1:57:29.100\n I looked at, from my microeconomics,\n\n1:57:29.100 --> 1:57:31.820\n macroeconomics in college perspective,\n\n1:57:31.820 --> 1:57:36.300\n GDP doesn't seem to capture the productivity,\n\n1:57:36.300 --> 1:57:40.980\n the full, the spectrum of what I think is\n\n1:57:40.980 --> 1:57:43.900\n as a functioning successful society.\n\n1:57:43.900 --> 1:57:46.700\n What do you think is broken about GDP?\n\n1:57:46.700 --> 1:57:48.540\n What does it need to include?\n\n1:57:49.540 --> 1:57:51.500\n These indices, like what?\n\n1:57:51.500 --> 1:57:53.680\n Let me explain what they don't understand to begin with.\n\n1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:54.520\n Sure.\n\n1:57:54.520 --> 1:57:59.520\n Imagine that all prices and all quantities of output\n\n1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:04.320\n are the same at the end of the year\n\n1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:05.720\n as they are at the beginning.\n\n1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:09.060\n And you ask what happened during that year?\n\n1:58:09.060 --> 1:58:10.240\n Was there inflation?\n\n1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:12.780\n They meandered over the course of the year,\n\n1:58:12.780 --> 1:58:16.360\n but miraculously they all came back to exactly their values.\n\n1:58:17.300 --> 1:58:20.740\n The amount produced at the end of the year\n\n1:58:20.740 --> 1:58:24.000\n is the same as at the beginning in every single quantity.\n\n1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.120\n Typically the claim would be that the price index\n\n1:58:26.120 --> 1:58:30.180\n should be 1.0 and that the quantity index should be 1.0.\n\n1:58:30.180 --> 1:58:31.380\n That's clearly wrong.\n\n1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:34.240\n Why?\n\n1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:37.900\n Well, it's much easier to see with,\n\n1:58:37.900 --> 1:58:41.800\n it speaks to a fundamental confusion that economists have.\n\n1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.200\n They don't understand that the economy is curved\n\n1:58:44.200 --> 1:58:45.140\n and not flat.\n\n1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:50.720\n In a curved economy, everything should be path dependence,\n\n1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:53.060\n but they view path dependence as a problem\n\n1:58:53.060 --> 1:58:55.880\n because they are effectively the flat earth society\n\n1:58:55.880 --> 1:58:57.640\n of market analysis.\n\n1:58:57.640 --> 1:58:59.800\n They don't understand that what they've called,\n\n1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:02.560\n and they've actually called it the cycling problem,\n\n1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:04.960\n is exactly what they need to understand\n\n1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:06.600\n to advance their field.\n\n1:59:06.600 --> 1:59:09.440\n So I'll give you a very simple example, okay?\n\n1:59:09.440 --> 1:59:13.440\n Let's imagine that we have Bob and Carol in one hedge fund\n\n1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:15.060\n and Ted and Alice in another.\n\n1:59:15.060 --> 1:59:20.060\n In both cases, the females, that is, Alice and Carol,\n\n1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:22.180\n are the chief investment officers,\n\n1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:26.960\n and Bob and Ted are the chief marketing officers\n\n1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:29.040\n in charge of trying to get money into the fund\n\n1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:34.040\n and trying to get people not to, in fact,\n\n1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:37.140\n remove their money from the funds, okay?\n\n1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:43.640\n If you, in fact, had a hedge fund\n\n1:59:43.640 --> 1:59:47.240\n with Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice,\n\n1:59:47.240 --> 1:59:51.280\n and both hedge funds were invested in assets\n\n1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:53.480\n whose prices came back to the same levels\n\n1:59:53.480 --> 1:59:57.480\n and whose exposures were in the same quantities,\n\n2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:02.880\n and you wanted to compensate these two hedge funds,\n\n2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:06.200\n would you compensate them the same necessarily?\n\n2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:11.200\n What if, for example, Carol was killing it\n\n2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:12.760\n in terms of investments?\n\n2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:16.000\n Every time she bought some sort of security,\n\n2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:20.580\n the price of that security went up, okay?\n\n2:00:20.580 --> 2:00:25.440\n But Bob was the worst marketing officer,\n\n2:00:25.440 --> 2:00:26.680\n and as chief marketing officer,\n\n2:00:26.680 --> 2:00:28.080\n there were tons of redemptions\n\n2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:30.960\n because Bob was constantly drunk,\n\n2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:33.800\n Bob was making off color comments.\n\n2:00:33.800 --> 2:00:36.520\n Now, as a result, at the end of the year,\n\n2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:38.560\n the fund hasn't grown in size\n\n2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:40.800\n because even though Carol was crushing it\n\n2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:43.000\n in terms of the investments,\n\n2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:45.200\n Bob was screwing up everything\n\n2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:47.520\n and the redemptions were legendary,\n\n2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:48.660\n so people were making money\n\n2:00:48.660 --> 2:00:50.560\n and still pulling it out of the fund.\n\n2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:56.440\n In the other fund, Alice can't seem to buy a base hit\n\n2:00:57.160 --> 2:01:00.720\n every time she gets into a security, the thing plummets,\n\n2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:05.520\n but Ted's amazing marketing skills allowed the fund\n\n2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:07.240\n to get all sorts of new subscriptions\n\n2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:09.760\n and halted the redemptions as people hoped\n\n2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:13.000\n that the fund would get its act together, okay.\n\n2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:19.960\n Price indices should be how Carol and Alice are compensated,\n\n2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:30.080\n and quantity indices should be how Bob and Ted\n\n2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:34.240\n are compensated, so even though both funds\n\n2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:38.560\n had closed loops that come back to the original states,\n\n2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:41.640\n what happened during the period that they were active\n\n2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:44.240\n tells you how people are supposed to be compensated.\n\n2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.000\n Now, we know that whatever the increase\n\n2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:53.640\n in the price index is, is compensated by a decrease\n\n2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:56.040\n in the quantity index or conversely,\n\n2:01:56.900 --> 2:01:58.080\n because prices and quantities\n\n2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:00.140\n return to their original values.\n\n2:02:00.140 --> 2:02:02.040\n You could have another fund where nothing much happened,\n\n2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:04.920\n there were no redemptions, no subscriptions,\n\n2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:08.080\n the fund remained in cash the whole time.\n\n2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:10.920\n So in that third fund, you know,\n\n2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:13.940\n let's call that Tristan and Isolde, right?\n\n2:02:13.940 --> 2:02:17.080\n That fund should have no bonuses paid\n\n2:02:17.080 --> 2:02:18.120\n because nobody did anything,\n\n2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:20.400\n but nobody should be fired either.\n\n2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:24.360\n Now, the fact that the economists don't even understand\n\n2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:26.520\n that this is what their price and quantity indices\n\n2:02:26.520 --> 2:02:29.600\n were intended to do, that they don't understand\n\n2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:31.500\n that you can actually give what would be called\n\n2:02:31.500 --> 2:02:35.160\n ordinal agents the freedom to change their preferences\n\n2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:38.640\n and still have something defined as a\n\n2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:41.160\n CONUS cost of living adjustment.\n\n2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:43.940\n They don't even understand the mathematics of their field.\n\n2:02:43.940 --> 2:02:46.000\n So the indices need to be able to capture\n\n2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.080\n some kind of dynamics that...\n\n2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:51.200\n We have had indices that capture these dynamics\n\n2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:54.240\n due to the work of Francois de Vizier since 1925.\n\n2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:57.720\n But the economists have not even understood\n\n2:02:57.720 --> 2:02:59.800\n what de Vizier's index truly represent.\n\n2:02:59.800 --> 2:03:04.020\n What do you miss with such crude indices then?\n\n2:03:04.020 --> 2:03:06.440\n Well, you miss the fact that you're supposed\n\n2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:09.240\n to have a field theoretic subject.\n\n2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:11.120\n The representative consumer should actually\n\n2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.500\n be a probability distribution on the space\n\n2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:16.160\n of all possible consumers weighted by the probability\n\n2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:19.660\n of getting any particular pull from the distribution.\n\n2:03:19.660 --> 2:03:23.120\n We should not have a single gauge of inflation.\n\n2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:25.200\n What is that in 1973 dollars?\n\n2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:27.120\n Any more than you should be able to say\n\n2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:31.160\n it was 59 degrees Fahrenheit on earth yesterday.\n\n2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:34.960\n So when we get to the cryptocurrency,\n\n2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:37.040\n what I'm going to say is that\n\n2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:39.940\n because we didn't found economic theory\n\n2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:41.880\n on the proper marginal revolution,\n\n2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:44.000\n because we missed the major opportunity,\n\n2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.240\n which is that the differential calculus of markets\n\n2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:48.320\n is gauge theory.\n\n2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:53.320\n It's not ordinary differential calculus.\n\n2:03:53.620 --> 2:03:55.560\n We found that out in finance\n\n2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:58.220\n that it was stochastic differential calculus.\n\n2:03:58.220 --> 2:04:00.720\n We have the wrong version of the differential calculus\n\n2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:03.760\n underneath all of modern economic theory.\n\n2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:06.720\n And part of what I've been pushing for in cryptocurrencies\n\n2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:09.000\n is the idea that we should be understanding\n\n2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:11.500\n that gold is a gauge theory,\n\n2:04:11.500 --> 2:04:13.700\n just as modern economic theory\n\n2:04:13.700 --> 2:04:15.600\n is supposed to be a gauge theory.\n\n2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:18.960\n And that we should be looking to liberate cryptocurrencies\n\n2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:21.160\n and more importantly distributed computing\n\n2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:25.660\n from the problem of this unwanted global aspect,\n\n2:04:25.660 --> 2:04:26.800\n which is the blockchain.\n\n2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:29.520\n The thing that is most celebrated in some sense\n\n2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:31.600\n about Bitcoin is in fact the reason\n\n2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:33.400\n that I'm least enthusiastic about it.\n\n2:04:33.400 --> 2:04:36.480\n I'm hugely enthusiastic about what Satoshi did.\n\n2:04:38.020 --> 2:04:40.820\n But it's an intermediate step towards trying to figure out\n\n2:04:40.820 --> 2:04:43.680\n what should digital gold actually be?\n\n2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:48.680\n If physical gold is a collection of up quarks\n\n2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:52.560\n and down quarks in the form of protons and neutrons\n\n2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:55.180\n held together, the quarks by gluons\n\n2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:57.780\n with electrons orbiting and held together by photons\n\n2:04:57.780 --> 2:05:01.020\n with the occasional weak interaction beta decay,\n\n2:05:01.020 --> 2:05:02.720\n all of those are gauge theories.\n\n2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:06.240\n So gold is actually coming from gauge theory\n\n2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:08.280\n and markets are coming from gauge theory.\n\n2:05:08.280 --> 2:05:12.420\n And the opportunity to do locally enforced conservation laws,\n\n2:05:12.420 --> 2:05:15.680\n which effectively is what a Bitcoin transaction is,\n\n2:05:15.680 --> 2:05:19.780\n should theoretically be founded on a different principle\n\n2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:21.400\n that is not the blockchain.\n\n2:05:21.400 --> 2:05:23.880\n It should be a gauge theoretic concept\n\n2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:27.560\n in which effectively the tokens are excitations\n\n2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:29.640\n on a network of computer nodes.\n\n2:05:30.480 --> 2:05:34.480\n And the fact that, let's imagine that this is some token.\n\n2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:39.560\n By moving it from my custodianship to your custodianship,\n\n2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:43.040\n effectively I pushed that glass as a gauge theory\n\n2:05:43.040 --> 2:05:45.280\n towards your region of the table.\n\n2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:47.600\n We should be recognizing the gauge theory\n\n2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:51.380\n is the correct differential calculus for the 21st century.\n\n2:05:51.380 --> 2:05:53.280\n In fact, it should have been there in the 20th century.\n\n2:05:53.280 --> 2:05:57.880\n You're saying it captures these individual dynamics,\n\n2:05:57.880 --> 2:05:58.720\n much richer.\n\n2:05:58.720 --> 2:06:01.840\n Why should my giving you a token have to be,\n\n2:06:01.840 --> 2:06:05.120\n why should we alert the global community\n\n2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:06.800\n in this token that that occurred?\n\n2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:08.000\n You can talk about side chains,\n\n2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.040\n you can talk about any means of doing this,\n\n2:06:10.040 --> 2:06:11.520\n but effectively we have a problem,\n\n2:06:11.520 --> 2:06:13.880\n which is if I think about this differently,\n\n2:06:13.880 --> 2:06:16.960\n I have a glass that is extant,\n\n2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:18.640\n you have a glass that is abstent.\n\n2:06:19.740 --> 2:06:23.080\n We're supposed to call the constructor method\n\n2:06:23.080 --> 2:06:24.720\n on your glass at the same moment\n\n2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:26.840\n we call the destructor method on my glass\n\n2:06:26.840 --> 2:06:29.280\n in order to have a conservation principle.\n\n2:06:29.280 --> 2:06:32.080\n It would be far more efficient to do this\n\n2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:34.720\n with the one system that is known\n\n2:06:34.720 --> 2:06:37.120\n never to throw an exception, which is nature.\n\n2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:39.280\n And nature has chosen gauge theory and geometry\n\n2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:41.460\n for her underlying language.\n\n2:06:41.460 --> 2:06:45.360\n We now know due to work of Pia Malani at Harvard\n\n2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:49.720\n in economics in the mid 1990s, which I was her coauthor on,\n\n2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:54.720\n but I wish to promote her as well as this being my idea.\n\n2:06:57.480 --> 2:06:59.720\n We know that modern economic theory\n\n2:06:59.720 --> 2:07:01.880\n is a naturally occurring gauge theory.\n\n2:07:01.880 --> 2:07:04.320\n And the failure of that community to acknowledge\n\n2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:06.940\n that that work occurred and that it was put down\n\n2:07:06.940 --> 2:07:09.160\n for reasons that make no analytic sense\n\n2:07:10.720 --> 2:07:13.480\n is important in particular due to the relatively\n\n2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:15.800\n new innovation of distributed computing\n\n2:07:15.800 --> 2:07:17.560\n and Satoshi's brainchild.\n\n2:07:17.560 --> 2:07:20.040\n So you're thinking we need to have the mathematics\n\n2:07:20.040 --> 2:07:23.200\n that captures, that enforces cryptocurrency\n\n2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:25.760\n as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized one\n\n2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:30.240\n where the blockchain says that crypto should be centralized.\n\n2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:35.000\n The abundance economy much discussed in Silicon Valley\n\n2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:38.960\n or what's left of it is actually a huge threat\n\n2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:41.200\n to the planet because what it really is\n\n2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:43.240\n is that it is what Marc Andreessen\n\n2:07:43.240 --> 2:07:45.520\n has called software eating the world.\n\n2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:47.520\n And what that means is that you're gonna push\n\n2:07:47.520 --> 2:07:49.360\n things from being private goods and services\n\n2:07:49.360 --> 2:07:51.440\n into public goods and services and public goods\n\n2:07:51.440 --> 2:07:55.840\n and services cannot have price and value tied together.\n\n2:07:55.840 --> 2:07:59.060\n Ergo, people will produce things of incredible value\n\n2:07:59.060 --> 2:08:01.860\n to the world that they cannot command a price\n\n2:08:01.860 --> 2:08:03.740\n and they will not be able to capture the value\n\n2:08:03.740 --> 2:08:05.920\n that they have created or a significant enough\n\n2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:07.080\n fraction of it.\n\n2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:09.820\n The abundance economy is a disaster.\n\n2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:13.220\n It will lead to a reduction in human freedom.\n\n2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:16.720\n The great innovation of Satoshi is locally enforced\n\n2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:20.440\n or semi locally enforced conservation laws\n\n2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:22.760\n where the idea is just as gold is hard,\n\n2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:24.960\n why is gold hard to create or destroy?\n\n2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:26.720\n It's because it's created not only in stars\n\n2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:28.680\n but in violent events involving stars\n\n2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:30.260\n like supernova collisions.\n\n2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:35.440\n When gold is created and we transact,\n\n2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:38.080\n we're using conservation laws.\n\n2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:41.280\n The physics determines the custodianship,\n\n2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:43.920\n whatever it is that I don't have, you now have\n\n2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:47.400\n and conversely, in such a situation,\n\n2:08:47.400 --> 2:08:49.760\n we should be looking for the abstraction\n\n2:08:49.760 --> 2:08:52.100\n that most closely matches the physical world\n\n2:08:52.100 --> 2:08:53.480\n because the physical world is known\n\n2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:55.240\n not to throw an exception.\n\n2:08:55.240 --> 2:08:57.200\n The blockchain is a vulnerability.\n\n2:08:57.200 --> 2:09:00.720\n The idea that the 51% problem isn't solved,\n\n2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:03.600\n that you could have crazy race conditions,\n\n2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:06.880\n all of these things, we know that they're solved\n\n2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:08.880\n inside of gauge theory somehow.\n\n2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:12.200\n So the important thing is to recognize\n\n2:09:12.200 --> 2:09:15.140\n that one of the greatest intellectual feats ever\n\n2:09:15.140 --> 2:09:18.840\n in the history of economic theory took place already\n\n2:09:18.840 --> 2:09:22.040\n and was essentially instantly buried\n\n2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:24.120\n and I will stand by those comments.\n\n2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:28.320\n Satoshi, wherever you are, I probably know you.\n\n2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:29.420\n Are you Satoshi?\n\n2:09:29.420 --> 2:09:30.260\n No.\n\n2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:33.000\n No, no, no, I don't have that kind of ability.\n\n2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:34.360\n I really don't.\n\n2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:35.260\n I do other things.\n\n2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:38.520\n Speaking of Satoshi and gauge theory,\n\n2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:41.520\n you've mentioned to Brian Keating\n\n2:09:43.240 --> 2:09:47.360\n that you may be releasing a geometric unity paper this year\n\n2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:51.800\n or some other form of additional material on the topic.\n\n2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:54.120\n What is your thinking around this?\n\n2:09:54.120 --> 2:09:56.320\n What's the process you're going through now\n\n2:09:56.320 --> 2:09:58.760\n in preparing this?\n\n2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:02.040\n I used April 1st to try to start a tradition\n\n2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:04.860\n which I hope to use to liberate mankind.\n\n2:10:04.860 --> 2:10:09.860\n The tradition is that at least one day a year,\n\n2:10:10.180 --> 2:10:13.220\n you should be able to say heretical things\n\n2:10:13.220 --> 2:10:16.900\n and not have Jack Dorsey boot you off or Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n2:10:16.900 --> 2:10:18.580\n Your provost shouldn't call you up and say,\n\n2:10:18.580 --> 2:10:19.640\n what did you say?\n\n2:10:20.660 --> 2:10:23.660\n We need at some level to have a jubilee\n\n2:10:23.660 --> 2:10:26.540\n from centralized control.\n\n2:10:26.540 --> 2:10:28.780\n And so my hope is that,\n\n2:10:28.780 --> 2:10:30.940\n you know what a tradition is in America?\n\n2:10:30.940 --> 2:10:35.860\n Something a baby boomer did twice.\n\n2:10:35.860 --> 2:10:37.020\n Impeachment.\n\n2:10:37.020 --> 2:10:39.660\n That's very funny.\n\n2:10:41.220 --> 2:10:45.700\n Anyway, so I'm not a baby boomer, but as an exer,\n\n2:10:46.620 --> 2:10:48.820\n I've thought about whether or not April 1st\n\n2:10:48.820 --> 2:10:52.740\n would be a good date on which to release a printed version\n\n2:10:52.740 --> 2:10:55.180\n of what I already said in lecture form.\n\n2:10:55.180 --> 2:10:56.980\n Because I think it's hysterically funny\n\n2:10:56.980 --> 2:10:59.260\n that the physics community claims\n\n2:10:59.260 --> 2:11:02.500\n that it can't decode a lecture.\n\n2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:04.580\n It must be paper.\n\n2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:05.700\n And you know what?\n\n2:11:05.700 --> 2:11:08.540\n There will be a steady stream of new complaints\n\n2:11:08.540 --> 2:11:10.820\n up until the point that they fit it into a narrative\n\n2:11:10.820 --> 2:11:11.660\n that they like.\n\n2:11:13.700 --> 2:11:16.220\n Yeah, I'm thinking about April 1st\n\n2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:19.340\n as a date in which to release a document\n\n2:11:19.340 --> 2:11:21.100\n and it won't be perfectly complete,\n\n2:11:21.100 --> 2:11:22.960\n but it'll be very complete.\n\n2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:26.560\n And then they'll try to say, it's wrong.\n\n2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:27.580\n Or you already did it.\n\n2:11:27.580 --> 2:11:29.420\n Or no, that was dumb,\n\n2:11:29.420 --> 2:11:31.660\n but what we just did on top of it is brilliant.\n\n2:11:31.660 --> 2:11:34.500\n Or it doesn't match experiment.\n\n2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:35.340\n Or who knows what.\n\n2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:37.500\n They'll go through all of their usual nonsense.\n\n2:11:38.780 --> 2:11:40.300\n It's time to go.\n\n2:11:40.300 --> 2:11:43.240\n Is there still puzzles in your own mind\n\n2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:44.460\n that need to be figured out\n\n2:11:44.460 --> 2:11:46.120\n for you to try to put it on paper?\n\n2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:48.220\n I mean, those are different mediums, right?\n\n2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:50.220\n It was a great question.\n\n2:11:50.220 --> 2:11:51.820\n I did not count on something\n\n2:11:51.820 --> 2:11:53.380\n that turns out to be important.\n\n2:11:54.700 --> 2:11:57.100\n When you work on your own outside of the system\n\n2:11:57.100 --> 2:11:58.820\n for a long time,\n\n2:11:58.820 --> 2:12:00.780\n you probably don't think you're gonna be doing this\n\n2:12:00.780 --> 2:12:03.020\n as a 55 year old man.\n\n2:12:03.940 --> 2:12:06.020\n And I have been so long outside\n\n2:12:06.020 --> 2:12:07.380\n of math and physics departments,\n\n2:12:07.380 --> 2:12:09.020\n and I've been occupied with so many other things\n\n2:12:09.020 --> 2:12:10.540\n as you can see,\n\n2:12:10.540 --> 2:12:14.260\n that the old idea that I had was\n\n2:12:14.260 --> 2:12:16.520\n if I always did it in little pieces,\n\n2:12:17.380 --> 2:12:21.460\n then I was always safe because it wouldn't be stealable.\n\n2:12:21.460 --> 2:12:26.100\n And so now those pieces never got assembled completely.\n\n2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:29.060\n In essence, I have all the pieces\n\n2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:32.540\n and I can fit them together.\n\n2:12:32.540 --> 2:12:35.760\n But there's probably a small amount of glue code.\n\n2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:37.260\n Like there are a few algebraic things\n\n2:12:37.260 --> 2:12:38.340\n I've forgotten how to do.\n\n2:12:38.340 --> 2:12:39.940\n I may or may not figure them out\n\n2:12:39.940 --> 2:12:41.940\n between now and April 1st.\n\n2:12:41.940 --> 2:12:43.500\n But it's pretty complete.\n\n2:12:43.500 --> 2:12:46.400\n But that's the puzzle you're kind of struggling\n\n2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:47.940\n to now figure out,\n\n2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:50.820\n to get it all in the same, the glue together.\n\n2:12:50.820 --> 2:12:52.460\n I can't tell you whether the theory\n\n2:12:52.460 --> 2:12:54.220\n is correct or incorrect.\n\n2:12:54.220 --> 2:12:56.400\n But for example, there's what's the exact form\n\n2:12:56.400 --> 2:12:57.900\n of the supersymmetry algebra,\n\n2:12:57.900 --> 2:13:00.780\n or what's the rule for passing a minus sign\n\n2:13:00.780 --> 2:13:02.900\n through a particular operator.\n\n2:13:02.900 --> 2:13:05.820\n And all of that stuff got a lot more difficult\n\n2:13:05.820 --> 2:13:09.220\n because I didn't do it every,\n\n2:13:09.220 --> 2:13:14.220\n look, it's a little bit like if you're a violinist\n\n2:13:14.220 --> 2:13:17.700\n and you don't touch your violin regularly for 15 years,\n\n2:13:17.700 --> 2:13:19.940\n you come back to it and you pretty much know the pieces,\n\n2:13:19.940 --> 2:13:21.800\n sort of, but there's lots of stuff that's missing,\n\n2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:24.040\n your tone is off and that kind of stuff.\n\n2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:27.020\n I would say I'll get the ship to the harbor\n\n2:13:27.020 --> 2:13:30.420\n and it'll require a tugboat probably to get it in.\n\n2:13:30.420 --> 2:13:31.740\n And if the tugboat doesn't show up,\n\n2:13:31.740 --> 2:13:34.540\n then I'll pilot the thing right into the dock myself.\n\n2:13:34.540 --> 2:13:35.780\n But it's not a big deal.\n\n2:13:35.780 --> 2:13:38.480\n I think that it is essentially complete.\n\n2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:41.300\n Psychologically, just as a human being,\n\n2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:45.500\n this is, I remember perhaps by accident,\n\n2:13:45.500 --> 2:13:48.660\n but maybe there's no accidents in the universe.\n\n2:13:48.660 --> 2:13:51.380\n I was tuned in, I don't remember where,\n\n2:13:51.380 --> 2:13:56.380\n on April 1st to you, oh, I think on your Discord,\n\n2:13:58.020 --> 2:14:00.980\n kind of thinking about, thinking through this release.\n\n2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:02.180\n I mean, it wasn't like,\n\n2:14:03.180 --> 2:14:04.860\n it wasn't obvious that you were going to do it,\n\n2:14:04.860 --> 2:14:05.860\n you were thinking through it.\n\n2:14:05.860 --> 2:14:08.500\n And I remember there was intellectual,\n\n2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:11.420\n personal, psychological struggle with this, right?\n\n2:14:11.420 --> 2:14:13.260\n Well, because I thought it was dangerous.\n\n2:14:13.260 --> 2:14:14.980\n If this turns out to be right,\n\n2:14:14.980 --> 2:14:16.500\n I don't know what it unlocks.\n\n2:14:16.500 --> 2:14:21.500\n If it's wrong, I think I understand where we are.\n\n2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:28.200\n If it's wrong, it'll be the first fool's gold\n\n2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.240\n that really looks like a theory of everything.\n\n2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:35.600\n It'll be the iron pyrites of physics.\n\n2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:38.520\n And we haven't even had fool's gold in my opinion yet.\n\n2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:40.440\n Got it.\n\n2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:45.360\n So what is your intuition why this looks right to you?\n\n2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:48.320\n Like why it feels like it would be,\n\n2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:49.160\n if wrong, the first fool's gold.\n\n2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:51.120\n I can say it very simply.\n\n2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:53.280\n It's way smarter than I am.\n\n2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:55.440\n Can you break that apart a little more?\n\n2:14:55.440 --> 2:14:56.880\n Every time you poke at it,\n\n2:14:56.880 --> 2:14:58.720\n it's giving you intuitions that follow\n\n2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:00.400\n with the currently known physics.\n\n2:15:00.400 --> 2:15:02.400\n Let's put it in computer science terms.\n\n2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:03.240\n Yes, please.\n\n2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:05.640\n Okay, there's a concept of technical debt\n\n2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:07.980\n that computer scientists struggle with.\n\n2:15:07.980 --> 2:15:09.180\n As you commit crimes,\n\n2:15:09.180 --> 2:15:11.680\n you have to pay those crimes back at a later date.\n\n2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:15.440\n In general, most of the problem with physical theories\n\n2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:20.360\n is that as you try to do something that matches reality,\n\n2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:23.120\n you usually have to go into some structure\n\n2:15:23.120 --> 2:15:25.140\n that gets you farther away.\n\n2:15:25.140 --> 2:15:26.680\n And your hope is, is that you're gonna be able\n\n2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:28.240\n to pay back the technical debt.\n\n2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:32.000\n And in general, these wind up as check hiding schemes\n\n2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:34.560\n or like you're funding a startup\n\n2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:37.000\n and there are too many pivots, right?\n\n2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:41.600\n So you keep adding epicycles in order to cover,\n\n2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:44.000\n things that have gone wrong.\n\n2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:48.400\n My belief is, is that this thing\n\n2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:53.040\n represents something like a summit to me.\n\n2:15:53.040 --> 2:15:57.860\n And I'm very proud of having found a route up this summit.\n\n2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:01.500\n But the root is what's due to me.\n\n2:16:01.500 --> 2:16:04.260\n The summit can't possibly be due to me.\n\n2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:09.680\n You know, like Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\n\n2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:13.180\n did not create Mount Everest.\n\n2:16:13.180 --> 2:16:14.460\n They know that they didn't create that.\n\n2:16:14.460 --> 2:16:18.780\n They figured out a way up.\n\n2:16:18.780 --> 2:16:20.900\n You gotta tell me what Mount Everest\n\n2:16:20.900 --> 2:16:22.860\n is in this metaphor relative\n\n2:16:22.860 --> 2:16:24.620\n and also connected to the technical debt.\n\n2:16:24.620 --> 2:16:28.100\n So technical debt is a negative thing that it's kind of,\n\n2:16:28.100 --> 2:16:30.500\n you will eventually have to pay it.\n\n2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:32.660\n Are you saying in the,\n\n2:16:32.660 --> 2:16:35.500\n in the ascent that you're seeing now in the theory\n\n2:16:35.500 --> 2:16:37.620\n is you do not have much technical debt.\n\n2:16:37.620 --> 2:16:38.460\n Well, that's right.\n\n2:16:38.460 --> 2:16:43.460\n That what happens is, is that early on what I would say is,\n\n2:16:43.460 --> 2:16:47.300\n I believe now that the physics community\n\n2:16:48.620 --> 2:16:51.940\n has said many things incorrectly\n\n2:16:51.940 --> 2:16:54.600\n about the current state of the universe.\n\n2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:57.820\n They're not wildly off, which is why,\n\n2:16:57.820 --> 2:16:59.340\n like for example, the claim is that\n\n2:16:59.340 --> 2:17:01.460\n there are three generations of matter.\n\n2:17:01.460 --> 2:17:03.520\n I do not believe that there are three generations of matter.\n\n2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:05.340\n I believe that there are two generations of matter\n\n2:17:05.340 --> 2:17:08.920\n and there's a third collection\n\n2:17:08.920 --> 2:17:13.100\n that looks like a generation of matter as the first two,\n\n2:17:13.100 --> 2:17:14.260\n only at low energy.\n\n2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:18.400\n Okay, well, that's not a frequent claim.\n\n2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:19.820\n People imagine that there are three\n\n2:17:19.820 --> 2:17:21.540\n or more generations of matter.\n\n2:17:21.540 --> 2:17:23.020\n I would claim that that's false.\n\n2:17:23.020 --> 2:17:25.100\n People claim that the matter is chiral.\n\n2:17:25.100 --> 2:17:27.220\n That is, it knows it's left from its right.\n\n2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:31.100\n I would claim that the chirality is not fundamental,\n\n2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:32.120\n but it is emergent.\n\n2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:36.160\n But we could keep going at all these sorts of things.\n\n2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:38.280\n People think that space time\n\n2:17:38.280 --> 2:17:41.220\n is the fundamental geometrical construct.\n\n2:17:41.220 --> 2:17:42.060\n I do not agree.\n\n2:17:42.060 --> 2:17:45.520\n I think it's something that I've termed the observers.\n\n2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:48.560\n All of these different things\n\n2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:53.560\n represent a series of overinterpretations of the world\n\n2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:56.720\n that preclude progress.\n\n2:17:56.720 --> 2:18:01.080\n So you gave, I think you gave some credit\n\n2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:03.800\n to string theory as, string theory,\n\n2:18:03.800 --> 2:18:06.840\n I think loop quantum gravity, if I remember correctly,\n\n2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:11.600\n as like getting close to the fool's gold.\n\n2:18:11.600 --> 2:18:16.080\n Well, I said that Garrett Lisi, phenomenologically,\n\n2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:18.080\n gets a lot of things right.\n\n2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:20.600\n He gets, he's got a reason for chirality,\n\n2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:23.360\n a reason for uniqueness using E8.\n\n2:18:23.360 --> 2:18:25.920\n In fact, E8 uses something called vial fermions,\n\n2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:26.840\n which are chiral.\n\n2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:30.880\n He has a way of getting geometry\n\n2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:35.880\n to get Riemann's geometry underneath general relativity\n\n2:18:36.200 --> 2:18:38.160\n to play with Erisman's geometry,\n\n2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:39.560\n which is underneath the standard model,\n\n2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:41.360\n using something called Cartan connections\n\n2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:42.720\n that are out of favor.\n\n2:18:42.720 --> 2:18:46.000\n He's figured out something involving super connections\n\n2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:47.480\n to make sure that the fermion,\n\n2:18:47.480 --> 2:18:49.980\n the matter in the system isn't quantized\n\n2:18:49.980 --> 2:18:51.520\n the same way as the bosons were,\n\n2:18:51.520 --> 2:18:53.920\n which is a problem in his old theory.\n\n2:18:53.920 --> 2:18:56.440\n He's got something about three generations for triality.\n\n2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:59.600\n He's got a lot of phenomenological hits.\n\n2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:01.320\n I don't think Garrett's theory works.\n\n2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:02.960\n It also has a very simple Lagrangian.\n\n2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:05.680\n He's basically using the Yang Mills norm squared,\n\n2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:08.120\n the same thing you would use as a cost function\n\n2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:11.880\n if you were doing neural nets, okay?\n\n2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:16.480\n The string theorists have a different selling point,\n\n2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:18.120\n which is that they may have gotten\n\n2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:20.280\n a renormalizable theory of gravity\n\n2:19:20.280 --> 2:19:22.640\n if quantum gravity was what we were meant to do.\n\n2:19:22.640 --> 2:19:24.480\n And they've done some stuff with black holes\n\n2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:28.320\n that they can get some solutions correct.\n\n2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:29.920\n And then they have lots of agreements\n\n2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:33.040\n with where they show mathematical truths\n\n2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:34.920\n that mathematicians didn't even know.\n\n2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:39.000\n I'm very underwhelmed by string theory\n\n2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.200\n based on how many people have worked on it\n\n2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:43.480\n and how little is supporting the claims\n\n2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:45.760\n to it being a theory of everything.\n\n2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:50.360\n But those are the two that I take quite seriously.\n\n2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:53.320\n I don't yet take Wolfram's quite seriously\n\n2:19:53.320 --> 2:19:57.280\n because if he really finds one of these cellular automata\n\n2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:00.040\n that are really distinct and generative,\n\n2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:01.160\n it'll be amazing.\n\n2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:02.920\n But he's looking for such a thing.\n\n2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.000\n I don't think he's found anything.\n\n2:20:05.000 --> 2:20:07.840\n Tegmark, I view as a philosopher\n\n2:20:07.840 --> 2:20:10.800\n who is somehow taking credit for Platonism,\n\n2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:13.720\n which I don't see any reason for fighting with Max\n\n2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:16.400\n because I like Max, but if it ever comes time,\n\n2:20:16.400 --> 2:20:18.760\n I'm putting a post it note that I'm not positive\n\n2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:21.320\n the mathematical universe hypothesis\n\n2:20:21.320 --> 2:20:22.680\n is really anything new.\n\n2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:28.400\n And in general, loop quantum gravity really,\n\n2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:29.880\n I think grew out of some hopes\n\n2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:32.600\n that the general relativistic community had\n\n2:20:32.600 --> 2:20:34.240\n that they would be able to do particle theory.\n\n2:20:34.240 --> 2:20:36.080\n And I don't think that they've shown\n\n2:20:36.080 --> 2:20:37.880\n any particle theoretic realism.\n\n2:20:37.880 --> 2:20:42.200\n So essentially, here's what I really think, Lex.\n\n2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:46.880\n I think we didn't understand how big the difference\n\n2:20:46.880 --> 2:20:49.440\n between an effective theory and a theory of everything\n\n2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:51.040\n is conceptually.\n\n2:20:51.040 --> 2:20:54.080\n Maybe it's not mathematically that different,\n\n2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:56.400\n but conceptually trying to figure out\n\n2:20:56.400 --> 2:20:58.360\n what a theory of every, how does the universe,\n\n2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:01.280\n and I've compared it to Escher's drawing hands.\n\n2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:04.720\n How do two hands draw themselves into existence?\n\n2:21:04.720 --> 2:21:08.720\n That's the puzzle that I think has just been wanting.\n\n2:21:08.720 --> 2:21:11.840\n And I'll be honest, I'm really surprised\n\n2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:16.840\n that the theoretical physics community didn't even get up\n\n2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:21.600\n on their high horse and say,\n\n2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:25.200\n this is the most stupid nonsense imaginable,\n\n2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:28.480\n because clearly I always say I'm not a physicist.\n\n2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:32.320\n So I'm an amateur with a heart as big as all outdoors.\n\n2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:35.960\n So in your journey of releasing this,\n\n2:21:35.960 --> 2:21:39.960\n and I'm sure further maybe it will be\n\n2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:42.160\n another American tradition on April 1st\n\n2:21:42.160 --> 2:21:43.760\n that will continue for years to come.\n\n2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:44.600\n I hope so.\n\n2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:53.840\n There's sort of crumbs along the way\n\n2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:58.680\n that I'm hoping to collect in my naive view of things\n\n2:21:58.680 --> 2:22:03.680\n of the beauty that, in your geometric view of the universe.\n\n2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:08.680\n So one question I'd like to ask is\n\n2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:15.640\n if you were to challenge me to visualize something beautiful,\n\n2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:18.040\n something important about geometric unity\n\n2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:21.480\n in my struggle to appreciate some of its beauty\n\n2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:25.360\n from the outsider's perspective, what would that thing be?\n\n2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:27.760\n Interesting question.\n\n2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:29.960\n Perhaps we can both have a journey\n\n2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:35.120\n towards April 1st.\n\n2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:36.120\n Take a look at that.\n\n2:22:38.520 --> 2:22:41.880\n Some kind of a scrunchie that I picked up on Melrose,\n\n2:22:41.880 --> 2:22:44.680\n not Melrose, Montana in Santa Monica.\n\n2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:48.760\n Now you'll notice that all of those disks\n\n2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:51.480\n rotate independently.\n\n2:22:51.480 --> 2:22:52.320\n Yes.\n\n2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:59.360\n If you rotate groups of those in a way that is continuous,\n\n2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:01.200\n but not uniform everywhere,\n\n2:23:01.200 --> 2:23:04.800\n what you're doing is a so called gauge transformation\n\n2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:09.560\n on the torus seen as a U1 bundle over a U1 space time.\n\n2:23:09.560 --> 2:23:12.880\n So the concept of space time here\n\n2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:15.960\n in a very simplified case isn't four dimensional,\n\n2:23:15.960 --> 2:23:18.520\n but it's one dimensional, it's just a circle.\n\n2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:21.720\n And there's a circle above every point in the circle\n\n2:23:21.720 --> 2:23:23.560\n represented by those little disks.\n\n2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:28.560\n So imagine if you will, that we took a rubber band\n\n2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:33.680\n and placed it around here and decided\n\n2:23:33.680 --> 2:23:36.800\n that that was a function from the circle\n\n2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:41.800\n into the circle that is representing a Y axis\n\n2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:44.240\n that's wrapped around itself.\n\n2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:46.120\n Well, you would have an idea of what it means\n\n2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:47.880\n for a function to be constant,\n\n2:23:47.880 --> 2:23:50.240\n if it just went all around the outside.\n\n2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:53.840\n But what happens if I turn this a little bit?\n\n2:23:53.840 --> 2:23:55.600\n Then the function would be mostly constant.\n\n2:23:55.600 --> 2:23:58.480\n We'd have a little place where it dipped and it went back.\n\n2:23:58.480 --> 2:24:03.440\n It turns out that you can transform that function\n\n2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:06.760\n and transform the derivative that says that function\n\n2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:09.960\n is equal to zero when I take its derivative\n\n2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:11.400\n at the same time.\n\n2:24:11.400 --> 2:24:14.040\n That's what a gauge transformation is.\n\n2:24:14.040 --> 2:24:19.040\n Amazing to me that we don't have a simple video,\n\n2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:22.960\n visualizing things that I've already had built\n\n2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:26.280\n and that I can clearly demonstrate.\n\n2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:28.480\n When you do that Taurus,\n\n2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:31.800\n who's the code of the Taurus is itself generating.\n\n2:24:31.800 --> 2:24:32.640\n The Taurus.\n\n2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:33.480\n The spinning Taurus.\n\n2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:34.320\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:36.720\n This is a U1 principle bundle.\n\n2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:39.080\n And the world needs to know what a gauge theory is,\n\n2:24:39.080 --> 2:24:41.920\n not by analogy, not with Lawrence Krauss saying,\n\n2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:42.880\n it's like a checkerboard.\n\n2:24:42.880 --> 2:24:44.520\n If you change some of the colors this way,\n\n2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:49.520\n not saying that it's a local symmetry involving,\n\n2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:51.800\n it's none of those things.\n\n2:24:51.800 --> 2:24:53.840\n It's a theory of differential calculus\n\n2:24:53.840 --> 2:24:56.800\n where the functions and the derivatives\n\n2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:00.160\n are both subject to a particular kind of change\n\n2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:03.200\n so that if a function was constant under one derivative,\n\n2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:07.120\n then the new function is constant under the new derivative\n\n2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:09.280\n transformed in the same fashion.\n\n2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:11.080\n And would you put that under the category\n\n2:25:11.080 --> 2:25:12.880\n of just gauge transformations?\n\n2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:15.120\n Yes, that would be gauge transformations\n\n2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:17.080\n applied to sections and connections\n\n2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:19.520\n where connections are the derivatives in the theory.\n\n2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.200\n This is easily explained.\n\n2:25:23.200 --> 2:25:26.680\n It is pathological that the community of people\n\n2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:29.000\n who understand what I'm saying have never bothered\n\n2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:31.600\n to do this in a clear fashion for the general public.\n\n2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:34.720\n You and I could visualize this overnight.\n\n2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:37.000\n This is not hard.\n\n2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:41.200\n The public needs to know in some sense\n\n2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:43.880\n that let's say quantum electrodynamics,\n\n2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:45.600\n the theory of photons and electrons,\n\n2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:48.080\n more or less electrons are functions\n\n2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:50.560\n and photons are derivatives.\n\n2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:53.640\n Now there's some, you can object in some ways,\n\n2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:55.720\n but basically a gauge theory is the way\n\n2:25:55.720 --> 2:26:00.120\n in which you can translate a shift\n\n2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:02.320\n in the definition of the functions\n\n2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:04.440\n and the shift of the definition of the derivatives\n\n2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:08.880\n so that the underlying physics is not harmed or changed.\n\n2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:10.600\n So you have to do both at the same time.\n\n2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:12.120\n Now you and I can visualize that.\n\n2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:15.280\n So if what you wanted to do rather than going directly\n\n2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:18.760\n to geometric unity is that I could sit down with you\n\n2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:20.640\n and I could say here are the various components\n\n2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:24.520\n of geometric unity and if the public needs a visualization\n\n2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:27.800\n in order to play along, we've got a little over two months\n\n2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:29.880\n and I'd be happy to work with you.\n\n2:26:29.880 --> 2:26:32.480\n I love that as a challenge and I'll take it on\n\n2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:33.760\n and I hope we do make it happen.\n\n2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:38.280\n And David Goggins, if Lex doesn't do some super macho thing\n\n2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:42.240\n because he's gotta work to get some of this stuff done,\n\n2:26:42.240 --> 2:26:45.200\n you'll understand he'll be available to you after April.\n\n2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:47.720\n Thank you for the escape clause.\n\n2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:49.320\n I really needed that escape clause.\n\n2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:50.160\n I'm glad that's on record.\n\n2:26:50.160 --> 2:26:53.000\n I'm worried 48 miles in 48 hours.\n\n2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.440\n By the way, I just wanna say how much I admire\n\n2:26:56.600 --> 2:27:00.240\n your willingness to keep this kind of hardcore attitude.\n\n2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:04.120\n I know that Russians have it and Russian Jews have it\n\n2:27:04.120 --> 2:27:08.320\n in spades, but it's harder to do in a society that's sloppy\n\n2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:11.080\n and that's weak and that's lazy.\n\n2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:14.440\n And the fact that you bring so much heart to saying,\n\n2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:16.400\n I'm gonna bring this to jujitsu,\n\n2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:18.920\n I'm gonna bring this to guitar, I'm gonna bring this to AI,\n\n2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:21.240\n I'm gonna bring this to podcasting.\n\n2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:22.680\n It comes through loud and clear.\n\n2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:25.080\n I just find it completely and utterly inspiring\n\n2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:28.800\n that you keep this kind of hardcore aspect at the same time\n\n2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:31.000\n that you're the guy who's extolling the virtue of love\n\n2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:33.280\n in a modern society and doing it at scale.\n\n2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:34.120\n Thank you.\n\n2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:34.960\n That means a lot.\n\n2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:36.040\n I don't know why I'm doing it,\n\n2:27:36.040 --> 2:27:37.840\n but I'm just following my heart on it\n\n2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:40.080\n and just going with the gut.\n\n2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:42.280\n It seems to make sense somehow.\n\n2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:45.840\n I personally think we better get tougher\n\n2:27:45.840 --> 2:27:47.920\n or we're gonna get in a world of pain.\n\n2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:51.560\n And I do think that when it comes time to lead,\n\n2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:53.600\n it's great to have people who you know\n\n2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:54.960\n don't crack under pressure.\n\n2:27:55.960 --> 2:27:59.160\n Do you mind if we talk about love\n\n2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:01.280\n and what it takes to be a father for a bit?\n\n2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:02.120\n Sure.\n\n2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:03.920\n Do you mind if Zev joins us?\n\n2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:04.800\n I'd be an honor.\n\n2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:11.560\n So Eric, I've talked to your son Zev,\n\n2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:14.080\n who's an incredible human being,\n\n2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:19.080\n but let me ask you,\n\n2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:21.080\n this might be difficult\n\n2:28:21.080 --> 2:28:22.880\n because you're both sitting together.\n\n2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:27.920\n What advice do you have for him\n\n2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:31.080\n as he makes his way in this world,\n\n2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:35.280\n especially given that, as we mentioned before on Joe Rogan,\n\n2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:38.560\n you're flawed in that just like all humans, you're mortal.\n\n2:28:39.920 --> 2:28:44.640\n Well, at some level, I guess one of my issues\n\n2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:47.280\n is that I've got to stop giving quite so much advice.\n\n2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:50.520\n Early on, I was very worried\n\n2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:52.760\n that I could see Zev's abilities\n\n2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:55.320\n and I could see his challenges\n\n2:28:55.320 --> 2:28:57.880\n and I saw them in terms of myself.\n\n2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:01.200\n So a certain amount of Zev rhymes with\n\n2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:02.720\n whatever I went through as a kid.\n\n2:29:02.720 --> 2:29:07.040\n And I don't wanna doom him to the same outcomes\n\n2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:08.960\n that sufficed for me.\n\n2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:11.840\n I think that he's got a much better head on his shoulders\n\n2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:14.800\n at age 15, he's much better adjusted.\n\n2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:19.240\n And in part, it's important for me to recognize\n\n2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:22.640\n that because I think I did a reasonably decent job early on,\n\n2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:26.400\n I don't need to get this part right.\n\n2:29:26.400 --> 2:29:31.400\n And I'm looking at Zev's trajectory and saying,\n\n2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:36.040\n you're gonna need to be incredibly\n\n2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:38.920\n and even pathologically self confident.\n\n2:29:38.920 --> 2:29:41.080\n The antidote for that is gonna be something\n\n2:29:41.080 --> 2:29:42.400\n you're gonna need to carry on board,\n\n2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:43.920\n which is radical humility.\n\n2:29:45.720 --> 2:29:46.640\n And you're gonna have to have those\n\n2:29:46.640 --> 2:29:49.080\n in a dialectical tension, which is never resolved,\n\n2:29:49.080 --> 2:29:51.000\n which is a huge burden.\n\n2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.480\n You are going to have to forgive people\n\n2:29:53.480 --> 2:29:55.520\n who do not appreciate your gifts\n\n2:29:55.520 --> 2:29:57.560\n because your gifts are clearly evident.\n\n2:29:57.560 --> 2:29:59.880\n And many people will have to pretend not to see them\n\n2:29:59.880 --> 2:30:02.520\n because if they see your gifts,\n\n2:30:02.520 --> 2:30:04.560\n then they're gonna have to question their entire approach\n\n2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:08.840\n to education or employment or critical thinking.\n\n2:30:08.840 --> 2:30:12.720\n And what my hope is, is that you can just forgive those\n\n2:30:12.720 --> 2:30:14.760\n who don't see them and who complicate\n\n2:30:14.760 --> 2:30:16.280\n and frustrate your life and realize\n\n2:30:16.280 --> 2:30:18.400\n that you're gonna have to take care of them too.\n\n2:30:18.400 --> 2:30:20.480\n Zev, let me ask you the more challenging question\n\n2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:22.360\n because the guy's sitting right here.\n\n2:30:22.360 --> 2:30:25.000\n What advice do you have for your dad?\n\n2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:26.560\n Since after talking to you,\n\n2:30:26.560 --> 2:30:30.680\n I realize you're the more brilliant\n\n2:30:30.680 --> 2:30:35.140\n aside from the better looking member of the family.\n\n2:30:38.920 --> 2:30:41.160\n It's a bit of an odd question.\n\n2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:43.840\n Sorry.\n\n2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:44.680\n You can say anything you want.\n\n2:30:44.680 --> 2:30:46.000\n This is the last time we're gonna be seeing left.\n\n2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:49.800\n It's gonna be an awkward drive home.\n\n2:30:49.800 --> 2:30:54.800\n I think sort of a new perspective I've taken on parenting\n\n2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:01.560\n is that it is a task for which no human\n\n2:31:01.560 --> 2:31:04.640\n is really supposed to be prepared.\n\n2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:08.160\n You know, there are in Jewish tradition, for example,\n\n2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:12.960\n there are myriad analogies in the Torah and the Talmud\n\n2:31:12.960 --> 2:31:17.960\n that compare the role of a parent to the role of a God,\n\n2:31:18.080 --> 2:31:18.920\n right?\n\n2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:21.560\n That no human is prepared to play God\n\n2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:23.840\n and create and guide a life,\n\n2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:27.640\n but somehow we're forced into it as people.\n\n2:31:29.040 --> 2:31:33.560\n And I think sometimes it's hard for children to understand\n\n2:31:33.560 --> 2:31:35.840\n that however their parents are failing\n\n2:31:38.260 --> 2:31:39.100\n sort of has to be.\n\n2:31:39.100 --> 2:31:40.560\n It's a theme here.\n\n2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:43.960\n Is something for which we must budget\n\n2:31:43.960 --> 2:31:46.560\n because our parents play a role in our lives\n\n2:31:46.560 --> 2:31:49.640\n of which they're not worthy\n\n2:31:49.640 --> 2:31:52.720\n and they devote themselves to regardless\n\n2:31:52.720 --> 2:31:55.940\n because that becomes who they are in a certain sense.\n\n2:31:55.940 --> 2:32:00.940\n So I hope to have realistic expectations of you as a human\n\n2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:12.000\n because I think too often it's easy\n\n2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.720\n to have godly expectations of people\n\n2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:18.020\n who are far from such a role.\n\n2:32:18.020 --> 2:32:20.600\n And I think I'm really happy\n\n2:32:20.600 --> 2:32:23.760\n that you've been as open as you have with me\n\n2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:28.640\n about the fact that, you know, you really,\n\n2:32:28.640 --> 2:32:31.120\n you don't pretend to be a God in my life.\n\n2:32:31.120 --> 2:32:36.120\n You are a guide who allows me to see myself\n\n2:32:38.600 --> 2:32:41.160\n and that's been very important considering the fact\n\n2:32:41.160 --> 2:32:46.160\n that by your self teaching paradigm I will have to,\n\n2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:50.800\n I will have to guide myself and being able to see it\n\n2:32:50.800 --> 2:32:53.900\n and see myself accurately has been one of the greatest gifts\n\n2:32:53.900 --> 2:32:55.640\n that you've given me.\n\n2:32:55.640 --> 2:32:57.760\n So I'm very appreciative.\n\n2:32:57.760 --> 2:33:02.760\n And I want you to know that I don't buy into the role\n\n2:33:02.760 --> 2:33:09.760\n that you're supposed to sort of fake your way through\n\n2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:19.520\n in my life but I am unbelievably happy\n\n2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:25.680\n with a more realistic connection\n\n2:33:25.680 --> 2:33:29.080\n that we've been able to build in lieu of it, so.\n\n2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:31.160\n I think it's been easier on you actually\n\n2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:34.000\n as you come to realize what I don't know,\n\n2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:37.160\n what I can't do and that there's been a period of time,\n\n2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:38.880\n I guess, that's fascinating to me\n\n2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:41.960\n where you're sort of surprised\n\n2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:45.120\n that I don't know the answer to a certain thing\n\n2:33:45.120 --> 2:33:46.100\n as well as you do.\n\n2:33:46.100 --> 2:33:50.120\n And that I remember going through this\n\n2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:52.360\n with a particular mathematician who I held,\n\n2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:55.440\n I still hold in awe, named David Kajdan.\n\n2:33:55.440 --> 2:33:58.320\n And, you know, he famously said to,\n\n2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:00.120\n and weirdly our family knew his family\n\n2:34:00.120 --> 2:34:01.160\n in the Soviet Union.\n\n2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:05.440\n But he said, you know, Eric,\n\n2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:07.480\n I always appreciate you coming to my office\n\n2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:10.440\n because I always find what you have to say interesting\n\n2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:11.800\n but you have to realize that in the areas\n\n2:34:11.800 --> 2:34:14.000\n that you're talking about, you are no longer the student,\n\n2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:16.120\n you are actually my teacher.\n\n2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:18.840\n And I wasn't prepared to hear that.\n\n2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:20.400\n And there are many ways in which,\n\n2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:22.840\n as I was just saying with the Mozart,\n\n2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:26.500\n I am learning at an incredible rate from you.\n\n2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:28.920\n I used to learn from you\n\n2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:30.600\n because I didn't understand what was possible.\n\n2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:33.840\n You were very much, I mean, this is the weird thing.\n\n2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:35.400\n There used to be this thing called Harvey,\n\n2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:36.400\n the invisible rabbit.\n\n2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:39.000\n This guy had a rabbit that was like six feet tall\n\n2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.680\n that only he could see maybe was talking.\n\n2:34:41.680 --> 2:34:43.600\n And that was like you at age four.\n\n2:34:44.780 --> 2:34:47.280\n You were saying batshit crazy things\n\n2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:48.920\n that were all totally sensible\n\n2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:50.760\n and nobody else could put them together.\n\n2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:55.340\n And so what's wonderful is that the world hasn't caught on,\n\n2:34:55.340 --> 2:34:58.560\n but enormous numbers of people are starting to.\n\n2:34:58.560 --> 2:35:03.560\n And I really do hope that that genuineness of spirit\n\n2:35:03.720 --> 2:35:08.380\n and that outside the box intellectual commitment\n\n2:35:08.380 --> 2:35:13.200\n serves you well as the world starts to appreciate\n\n2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:16.040\n that I think you're a very trustworthy voice.\n\n2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:17.360\n You don't get everything right,\n\n2:35:17.360 --> 2:35:20.160\n but the idea that we have somebody at your age\n\n2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:21.640\n who's embedded in your generation\n\n2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:23.840\n who can tell us something about what's happening\n\n2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:25.000\n is really valuable to me.\n\n2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:28.320\n And I do hope that you'll consider boosting that voice\n\n2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:30.900\n more than just at the dinner table.\n\n2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:36.480\n I apologize for saying this four letter word,\n\n2:35:36.480 --> 2:35:39.760\n but do you love Zev?\n\n2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:44.240\n Was really worried it was gonna be another four letter word.\n\n2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:46.320\n There's so many to choose from.\n\n2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:49.120\n It doesn't even rise to the level of the question.\n\n2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:53.800\n I mean, I just, there are a tiny number of people\n\n2:35:53.800 --> 2:35:56.560\n with whom you share so much life\n\n2:35:56.560 --> 2:36:01.340\n that you can't even think of yourself in their absence.\n\n2:36:01.340 --> 2:36:04.540\n And I don't know if Zev would find that,\n\n2:36:04.540 --> 2:36:08.780\n but it's, you can have a kid\n\n2:36:08.780 --> 2:36:11.780\n and never make this level of connection.\n\n2:36:11.780 --> 2:36:14.300\n I think even right down to the fact\n\n2:36:14.300 --> 2:36:18.980\n that when Zev chooses boogie woogie piano\n\n2:36:20.180 --> 2:36:22.380\n for his own set of reasons,\n\n2:36:22.380 --> 2:36:24.020\n why I would choose boogie woogie piano\n\n2:36:24.020 --> 2:36:28.620\n if I could play in any style, it's a question\n\n2:36:28.620 --> 2:36:30.820\n about a decrease in loneliness.\n\n2:36:30.820 --> 2:36:34.180\n You know, like my grandfather played the mandolin\n\n2:36:34.180 --> 2:36:35.820\n and I had to learn some mandolin\n\n2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:38.540\n because otherwise that instrument would go silent.\n\n2:36:39.940 --> 2:36:42.620\n You don't expect that you get this much of a chance\n\n2:36:42.620 --> 2:36:45.660\n to leave this much of yourself in another person\n\n2:36:45.660 --> 2:36:50.580\n who is choosing it and recreating it\n\n2:36:50.580 --> 2:36:54.060\n rather than it being directly instilled.\n\n2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:59.820\n And my proudest achievement is in a certain sense\n\n2:36:59.820 --> 2:37:04.820\n having not taught him and having shared this much.\n\n2:37:04.980 --> 2:37:09.780\n So, you know, it's not even love, it's like well beyond.\n\n2:37:09.780 --> 2:37:14.780\n So you mentioned love for you making a less lonely world.\n\n2:37:14.780 --> 2:37:19.780\n I think I speak for, I would argue,\n\n2:37:20.020 --> 2:37:22.860\n probably millions of people that you, Eric,\n\n2:37:22.860 --> 2:37:24.940\n because this is a conversation with you,\n\n2:37:24.940 --> 2:37:29.940\n have made for many people, for me, a less lonely world.\n\n2:37:30.220 --> 2:37:35.220\n And I can't wait to see how you develop as an intellect,\n\n2:37:35.740 --> 2:37:40.740\n but also I'm so heartworn by the optimism\n\n2:37:40.940 --> 2:37:43.420\n and the hopefulness that was in you\n\n2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:45.940\n that I hope develops further.\n\n2:37:45.940 --> 2:37:50.940\n And lastly, I'm deeply thankful that you, Eric are my friend\n\n2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:57.420\n and would give me, would honor me with this watch.\n\n2:37:57.540 --> 2:38:00.100\n It means more than words can say.\n\n2:38:00.100 --> 2:38:01.980\n Thanks guys, thanks for talking today.\n\n2:38:01.980 --> 2:38:03.540\n Thank you.\n\n2:38:03.540 --> 2:38:05.100\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:38:05.100 --> 2:38:08.180\n with Eric Weinstein and thank you to our
