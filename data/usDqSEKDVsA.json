  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:06.160\n The following is a conversation with Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector, human rights activist,\n\n00:06.160 --> 00:14.240\n and author of the book, In Order to Live. Quick mention of our sponsors, Belcampo, Gala Games,\n\n00:14.240 --> 00:19.040\n Batter Help, and Aid Sleep. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:19.840 --> 00:27.440\n Let me say a few words about North Korea. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea went through a famine.\n\n00:27.440 --> 00:34.080\n Mass starvation, caused primarily by King Jong Il, who at the time was the new leader of North\n\n00:34.080 --> 00:43.760\n Korea after his father's death in 1994. Somewhere between 600,000 and 3 million people died due to\n\n00:43.760 --> 00:50.160\n starvation. From all the stories of famine in history, including my own family history, I've\n\n00:50.160 --> 00:56.800\n come to understand that hunger tortures the human mind in a way that can break everything we stand\n\n00:56.800 --> 01:04.880\n for. In North Korea, during the 90s famine, many were driven to cannibalism. Imagine more than 10\n\n01:04.880 --> 01:12.160\n million people suffering starvation for months and years, always on the brink of death. We don't know\n\n01:12.160 --> 01:18.640\n the exact numbers of people who died because the suffering was done in silence, in darkness. Very\n\n01:18.640 --> 01:25.760\n little information in or out. Most people had to survive without electricity, without clean water,\n\n01:25.760 --> 01:31.760\n medical supplies, sanitation, and food. The North Korean propaganda machine called this\n\n01:31.760 --> 01:37.760\n the Arduous March, or the March of Suffering, and words such as famine and hunger were banned\n\n01:37.760 --> 01:44.800\n because they implied government failure. And once again, now, in 2021, King Jong Un,\n\n01:44.800 --> 01:50.160\n the current leader of North Korea, is calling for his country to prepare for another Arduous March,\n\n01:50.160 --> 01:56.160\n or March of Suffering. Another period of mass starvation as the country closes its borders.\n\n01:57.360 --> 02:03.040\n Looking at atrocities of the past decades and the encroaching atrocity there now, I think about the\n\n02:03.040 --> 02:08.320\n quiet suffering of millions of North Koreans. I think about the torture of the human spirit.\n\n02:08.880 --> 02:15.360\n I think about a North Korean child who could be a scientist, an artist, a writer, but who instead\n\n02:15.360 --> 02:21.120\n grows impossibly thin without food, their bodies slowly rotting away as their parents watch\n\n02:21.120 --> 02:28.640\n helplessly. I got emotional in this conversation with you and me, in part because I remembered my\n\n02:28.640 --> 02:35.520\n grandmother, who survived Khaldamur, the famine in Ukraine, intentionally created by Stalin,\n\n02:35.520 --> 02:42.160\n where 4 to 10 million people died and many, many more suffered. Imagine knowing that if you don't\n\n02:42.160 --> 02:47.520\n engage in cannibalism, you will die before your children did, and then they will be eaten.\n\n02:48.320 --> 02:52.880\n Imagine, because of this, deciding to murder and eat your own children,\n\n02:52.880 --> 02:59.920\n as many people did. Imagine the kind of desperation, torture, that leads up to a decision\n\n02:59.920 --> 03:05.920\n like that. I'm not smart enough to know what evil is, nor where to draw the line between good and\n\n03:05.920 --> 03:14.560\n evil. But Stalin, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, are men who in the name of power are willing to make\n\n03:14.560 --> 03:22.160\n millions of people, of children, suffer and die from starvation. I rarely have hate in my heart,\n\n03:22.160 --> 03:28.800\n but I hate these men. I hate that such men exist in this world. I hate that the beauty I love about\n\n03:28.800 --> 03:35.920\n this life exists amidst such unimaginable cruelty. I have been haunted by this conversation,\n\n03:36.480 --> 03:42.240\n by memories of my grandmother's pain. But I've also been warmed by memories of her love.\n\n03:43.360 --> 03:50.480\n Love gives me hope. Hope for the perseverance of the human spirit, even in the face of evil.\n\n03:51.920 --> 03:57.040\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with you and me, Park.\n\n03:57.040 --> 04:03.120\n Park. Can you tell your story from North Korea to today as you describe in your 2015 book,\n\n04:03.760 --> 04:08.560\n and with the extra perspective on life, love and freedom you've gained since then?\n\n04:08.560 --> 04:14.000\n Wow, that's a long story. So I was born in the northern part of North Korea initially.\n\n04:14.720 --> 04:22.000\n And my father was a party member. And my mom was housewife. I had one older sister.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:28.320\n And I remember born in that country. I never thought I was in an unusual country. Now I'm\n\n04:28.320 --> 04:34.800\n thinking of what is literally called the Hermit Kingdom. But I thought I believed that I was\n\n04:34.800 --> 04:41.360\n living in the best country on earth. It was a socialist paradise. And everybody in the rest\n\n04:41.360 --> 04:48.880\n of the world worshiped my ideal leader. And there was nothing to envy for me. So I had this\n\n04:48.880 --> 04:53.920\n enormous pride in my heart. And grateful to be in that country.\n\n04:54.480 --> 04:56.320\n So it was love for the leader, not fear?\n\n04:57.280 --> 05:03.120\n For me at least, it was love. Yeah, it was all the moderation and gratitude.\n\n05:03.840 --> 05:08.240\n It changed lately, but for me was pure, pure like love.\n\n05:08.800 --> 05:12.800\n Was there any, like looking back with the perspective you have now,\n\n05:12.800 --> 05:19.760\n would you describe some of those moments growing up as full of happiness? Or was that\n\n05:20.480 --> 05:26.000\n delusion at the time? So not knowing the alternative, will you still be able to be happy?\n\n05:26.960 --> 05:32.960\n The fact that I did not know, like in North Korea, this is the only country in this 21st century\n\n05:32.960 --> 05:39.440\n has no internet. And they don't even know the existence of internet. Not only that,\n\n05:39.440 --> 05:47.120\n we don't even have this 24 hour electricity. So not knowing definitely helped, I think,\n\n05:47.840 --> 05:53.280\n to be sane. So as a human being, you're still able to find moments of happiness?\n\n05:53.840 --> 05:59.760\n I think my happiness was from family, nothing else. Even though those days keep telling me\n\n05:59.760 --> 06:06.000\n that they were our source of meaning and happiness, I don't think I ever got happy by that.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.000\n Maybe they're here and they're in schools. And like when I was learning propaganda,\n\n06:10.560 --> 06:15.040\n like, you know, the proud feeling, right? I mean, the greatest nation here and there,\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:20.000\n but like actually true happiness came from laughing with my family, my friends.\n\n06:20.560 --> 06:26.400\n Are there any childhood memories, pleasant or painful ones that stand out to you now?\n\n06:28.800 --> 06:34.640\n I mean, like, you know, whenever I think about my North Korea, the interesting is\n\n06:34.640 --> 06:40.400\n there's no color. I mean, one is because North Korean country has no color, right? Most of\n\n06:40.400 --> 06:46.880\n things are unpaved and trees all cut down. We have no fear. So people cut down trees to\n\n06:46.880 --> 06:54.640\n make food. So but only that, like, even what we are wearing was like no color. So it's an\n\n06:55.360 --> 06:57.440\n interesting memory to look back.\n\n06:57.440 --> 07:04.720\n What about fashion? I've noticed from sort of you now, you have quite an incredible sense of\n\n07:04.720 --> 07:10.880\n fashion. So contrast that with your time in North Korea. How do you remember fashion? Just\n\n07:10.880 --> 07:14.880\n ways that people could express themselves visually. Was it all bland?\n\n07:15.600 --> 07:20.960\n There was no word for fashion in North Korea. We didn't even know. It was not even in our\n\n07:20.960 --> 07:25.920\n dictionary. So of course, I did not know what Victoria's Secret models were. I didn't even\n\n07:25.920 --> 07:32.080\n know what models were. So when I came out, I learned the model was a job. And like, what\n\n07:32.080 --> 07:38.000\n is that? And I'm still confused. So there's so many jobs that we have here doesn't exist\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:38.960\n in North Korea.\n\n07:39.840 --> 07:44.480\n What was life like in North Korea as compared to the rest of the world? So maybe you said\n\n07:44.480 --> 07:52.720\n there's no internet. 24 hour electricity is a luxury you do not have. What about food?\n\n07:52.720 --> 07:56.000\n What about water? What about basic human rights?\n\n07:56.000 --> 08:01.040\n I think that's a thing like when people were asking me, can you tell me about like life\n\n08:01.040 --> 08:06.480\n in North Korea? And in the past, I was like, I cannot describe it to you. And initially\n\n08:06.480 --> 08:10.480\n I thought, oh, because of my English that I cannot find the words. It's not that it's\n\n08:10.480 --> 08:16.640\n a different planet. The common sense that we have doesn't exist there. Like people literally\n\n08:16.640 --> 08:24.640\n do not know the concept of romantic love, or human rights or liberty. So when I'm thinking\n\n08:24.640 --> 08:31.280\n back to my country, it's, you know, like, as you cannot imagine your life on Mars right\n\n08:31.280 --> 08:37.440\n now. It's like that kind of difference. I grew up never seen the map of the world. I\n\n08:37.440 --> 08:42.720\n never knew that I was Asian. Like the regime told me that I was Kim Il Sung, the first\n\n08:42.720 --> 08:49.200\n Kim race. And then our calendar doesn't begin when Jesus Christ was born. Our calendar begins\n\n08:49.200 --> 08:55.840\n where Kim was born. So we, and history was forgotten to us. They didn't teach us about\n\n08:55.840 --> 09:02.720\n of course, Christianity or like the Big Bang. Like our history began when Kim was born.\n\n09:02.720 --> 09:08.480\n So everything was forgotten to us. And it was a different meaning. I mean, feeling of\n\n09:08.480 --> 09:14.480\n existence, you know, it's not even like same life. I literally think that was almost like\n\n09:14.480 --> 09:18.480\n my past life. And this is like a new life that I began.\n\n09:18.480 --> 09:20.480\n You're almost like a different human being now.\n\n09:20.480 --> 09:22.480\n Oh, absolutely. Yeah.\n\n09:22.480 --> 09:30.480\n So you've, I have to say, I often say that my favorite book is Animal Farm by George\n\n09:30.480 --> 09:36.480\n Orwell. I've read it, I don't know how many times. And so I was really happy to hear that\n\n09:36.480 --> 09:42.480\n that was of the many books, excellent books that we'll hopefully talk about. You've mentioned\n\n09:42.480 --> 09:50.480\n that Animal Farm had a big impact on you. It was the book that kind of led to a kind\n\n09:50.480 --> 09:54.480\n of awakening for you. Maybe can you describe what impact it had?\n\n09:54.480 --> 09:59.480\n So after going through what I went through, and I arrived in South Korea after many years\n\n09:59.480 --> 10:06.480\n of journey, they were saying, so Kims were dictators, and South Korea is not colonized\n\n10:06.480 --> 10:11.480\n by American bastards. And Americans, first of all, not bastards, they're good people.\n\n10:11.480 --> 10:16.480\n And then they say everything that you believe in North Korea was a lie. It was a propaganda.\n\n10:16.480 --> 10:22.480\n Then at 15, I was thinking, so if everything that I believe was a lie, how do I know what\n\n10:22.480 --> 10:29.480\n I believe is not a lie? That was so hard. How do I trust ever again? And I just, it\n\n10:29.480 --> 10:35.480\n was chaos in belief. I did not know what was true anymore. And that's the moment, a few\n\n10:35.480 --> 10:40.480\n years later, I read this book, like Animal Farm, just by mistake. It was a very short\n\n10:40.480 --> 10:46.480\n book in the library. I was like, okay, I can finish that quickly. And when they're ending\n\n10:46.480 --> 10:52.480\n that, like last chapter, they could not see between the pigs and humans anymore. That\n\n10:52.480 --> 10:59.480\n sentence, I just understood everything that happened. It made every sense to me, what\n\n10:59.480 --> 11:03.480\n happened to me, my people, and to my country.\n\n11:03.480 --> 11:09.480\n Yeah, there's so many things I could say about that book. Yeah, there's a haunting nature\n\n11:09.480 --> 11:16.480\n to the end. And I guess spoiler alert, but you should have read this already. If you're\n\n11:16.480 --> 11:22.480\n listening to this. At the end, the animals were looking to the humans and to the pigs\n\n11:22.480 --> 11:28.480\n and they couldn't see the difference. And then there's this kind of gradual transition\n\n11:28.480 --> 11:37.480\n from the initial revolutionary steps of animals fighting for their freedom to slowly the pigs\n\n11:37.480 --> 11:46.480\n gaining control, went from four legs good, two legs bad, to four legs good, two legs\n\n11:46.480 --> 11:51.480\n better, I believe. Two legs even better, I think, something like that. So like gradually\n\n11:51.480 --> 11:58.480\n transitioning the ideology under which the farm operates. And I think the gradual nature\n\n11:58.480 --> 12:06.480\n of that, where basically you have generations born not knowing how things were in the past.\n\n12:06.480 --> 12:16.480\n And that's what makes the most kind of, for me, haunting transition from freedom to slavery\n\n12:16.480 --> 12:22.480\n to suffering to injustice, all those things. And the animals don't know they're part of\n\n12:22.480 --> 12:31.480\n that. And also for me personally, I always kind of found a kinship with Boxer the horse\n\n12:31.480 --> 12:37.480\n because I just, I'm kind of an idiot, I just work really hard. And I just love the idea\n\n12:37.480 --> 12:47.480\n of working hard for an ideal. And the tragic nature of, to the end, that horse, Boxer,\n\n12:47.480 --> 12:56.480\n working his ass off for the pride for others. But yeah, for the pride of the farm, you know.\n\n12:56.480 --> 13:03.480\n And then the pigs giving him, sort of using that, but then just sending him to the slaughterhouse\n\n13:03.480 --> 13:09.480\n anyway, when he was no longer useful. I mean, there's so many tragic elements that echo\n\n13:09.480 --> 13:14.480\n everything I've seen in the Soviet Union. And many of the elements that you see in even\n\n13:14.480 --> 13:19.480\n harsher, more drastic way in North Korea. If there's something hopeful you pull from\n\n13:19.480 --> 13:26.480\n that book, like within the suffering, within the gradual decline, the taking away the freedom,\n\n13:26.480 --> 13:29.480\n there were still moments of beauty, it seemed like.\n\n13:29.480 --> 13:36.480\n It can be. But I think for me was when I was ending the last page of the book. Until that\n\n13:36.480 --> 13:42.480\n point, I was angry towards the dictator. Why do you do this as a human being? I was so\n\n13:42.480 --> 13:47.480\n angry, dreaming of killing him, right? Revenge on my father, the people that he killed.\n\n13:47.480 --> 13:54.480\n But when I was ending the last chapter, actually everybody was responsible to create this dystopia\n\n13:54.480 --> 14:02.480\n in my country. The initial animals, when they're scared, when they see the first execution,\n\n14:02.480 --> 14:07.480\n and then they were not doing their job, speaking out and keep questioning. They had a question\n\n14:07.480 --> 14:13.480\n and then as soon as they see a fear, they silence. Because of that, that's when I was\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:19.480\n like, my grandma knew life could be different. I think the one thing about North Koreans\n\n14:19.480 --> 14:24.480\n are unique is that they don't know they're oppressed. They don't know that they are slaves\n\n14:24.480 --> 14:29.480\n to the dictator. And the fact that other people know they're oppressed, like in America, a\n\n14:29.480 --> 14:33.480\n lot of people think they are oppressed, like you are not oppressed. You don't even know\n\n14:33.480 --> 14:39.480\n the definition of oppression. And that's like when the new animals came, the new animals\n\n14:39.480 --> 14:44.480\n didn't even know what the life could be like. There's no alternative for them to compare\n\n14:44.480 --> 14:49.480\n even. And I was like, my grandmother knew. Why didn't they not do anything about it?\n\n14:49.480 --> 14:54.480\n And they were just scared. They kept silent. And everybody was responsible.\n\n14:54.480 --> 15:01.480\n So the people who knew were too afraid to say. And then there's people that just didn't\n\n15:01.480 --> 15:07.480\n even know. And I don't know what's more terrifying about human nature, looking at this group\n\n15:07.480 --> 15:12.480\n of people who are afraid to say that things could be otherwise, and then the group of\n\n15:12.480 --> 15:17.480\n people that don't even know it could be better.\n\n15:17.480 --> 15:18.480\n No.\n\n15:18.480 --> 15:23.480\n It's, I don't know, that's the reason I return to that book often, because it's such, maybe\n\n15:23.480 --> 15:29.480\n because it's interesting using animals to represent ideas that were very human. It almost\n\n15:29.480 --> 15:37.480\n allows you to explore the darkness of human nature without sort of being broken by it.\n\n15:37.480 --> 15:44.480\n So you mentioned anger. When I watch your interviews, you're really calm and collected.\n\n15:44.480 --> 15:52.480\n Not just your interviews, you know, Instagram, the way you present yourself. You, I don't\n\n15:52.480 --> 15:58.480\n know, it seems like you're almost at peace with the world. Is there in private times\n\n15:58.480 --> 16:04.480\n when you're just angry? Do you feel fear? Do you go to dark places, depression, all\n\n16:04.480 --> 16:09.480\n those kinds of things? Are you, are you able to put that world that you were in behind\n\n16:09.480 --> 16:10.480\n you?\n\n16:10.480 --> 16:17.480\n It's a joke because I talk about North Korea every single day and I still rescue people\n\n16:17.480 --> 16:23.480\n like from China and Russia and other countries, right? And sometimes I'll rescue mission\n\n16:23.480 --> 16:28.480\n figures and they get captured and sent back. I still have people in North Korea report\n\n16:28.480 --> 16:35.480\n to me. So like when I talked to my sister who chose to not be in this life, activist\n\n16:35.480 --> 16:41.480\n life, she forgot most of things. And like for the other hand, I like to remember everything.\n\n16:41.480 --> 16:50.480\n So sometimes it's a blessing to keep reminded of how, because it's, you know, they say happiness\n\n16:50.480 --> 16:56.480\n is a relative thing. It is sometimes. I mean, I think it's also people say because nobody\n\n16:56.480 --> 17:01.480\n was foreign when you're growing up, everybody was suffering. You should have been okay,\n\n17:01.480 --> 17:07.480\n right? But no, like if you are suffering in that degree, no matter, even if there's no\n\n17:07.480 --> 17:11.480\n comparison, like if you're in Nazi Germany, in the Holocaust, right? In the concentration\n\n17:11.480 --> 17:16.480\n camp, I'm sure nobody was better than them. I'm sure they were suffering. It's the same\n\n17:16.480 --> 17:22.480\n thing. I suffered. But now because I'm in this place, I can compare easily, right? Getting\n\n17:22.480 --> 17:27.480\n that perspective. But it is true, like I still have days that I cannot get out of bed. And\n\n17:27.480 --> 17:33.480\n I really hoping like that when it was Elon Musk talking about downloading your brain,\n\n17:33.480 --> 17:39.480\n blah, blah, blah. Maybe technology develops that I can download some part of my memory\n\n17:39.480 --> 17:44.480\n and then I can erase it or delete it. And that'd be so much better.\n\n17:44.480 --> 17:51.480\n What I, this is a, sorry for the tough question, but if I came to you, if Elon came to you\n\n17:51.480 --> 17:56.480\n and said, we can erase that part of your memory, would you do it?\n\n17:56.480 --> 18:02.480\n Some days I would do it for sure. And my mom would do 100%. My sister would do it. All\n\n18:02.480 --> 18:10.480\n other defectors know they do 100%. For me, I hesitated because I'm a witness. So if I\n\n18:10.480 --> 18:17.480\n delete that part, I don't know how real that can be. But it is painful. After I talk, give\n\n18:17.480 --> 18:23.480\n a speech, right? I mean, I'm fine. But somehow I'm depressed. Sometimes if the talk was very\n\n18:23.480 --> 18:28.480\n intense, I'm like depressed for three weeks. It takes a while for me to be recharged. But\n\n18:28.480 --> 18:32.480\n I don't know why it is. I just don't know.\n\n18:32.480 --> 18:38.480\n Well, there's also the, and there's a guy named Victor Franco who wrote the book, Man\n\n18:38.480 --> 18:44.480\n Search for Meaning. And there's some aspect where, so he talks about the Holocaust and\n\n18:44.480 --> 18:49.480\n that you can, in those moments of suffering, still discover meaning, still discover happiness\n\n18:49.480 --> 18:55.480\n in the simplest of joys. Like while starving, a little piece of bread could be a source\n\n18:55.480 --> 19:04.480\n of incredible joy. And there's some aspect in which that experience gives you a clarity\n\n19:04.480 --> 19:11.480\n about the world. Like somehow experiencing suffering allows you to deeply experience\n\n19:11.480 --> 19:19.480\n joy and love, and also empathize with the suffering of others. And it's almost like\n\n19:19.480 --> 19:31.480\n brings you closer to other humans. This double edged sword that the highest of joys sometimes\n\n19:31.480 --> 19:36.480\n are catalyzed by suffering. And it's hard to know what to do with that. You see that\n\n19:36.480 --> 19:41.480\n with World War II, the stories of soldiers that have suffered, but some of the closest\n\n19:41.480 --> 19:49.480\n bonds of brotherhood, of just pure love was experienced by them. And it sucks that our\n\n19:49.480 --> 19:55.480\n brains are like this. Love requires hardship. I don't know why that is.\n\n19:55.480 --> 20:01.480\n Yeah, that's like that thing. Of course, in my journey, I learned how to survive, right?\n\n20:01.480 --> 20:08.480\n When to not trust and when to run. But I think most of us keep learning what it means to\n\n20:08.480 --> 20:13.480\n be a human being. I think that was like the ultimate thing I was keep learning. And I\n\n20:13.480 --> 20:19.480\n still don't know fully what it means. But I do think it seems like suffering is necessary\n\n20:19.480 --> 20:25.480\n for people to be grateful and even be joyful too sometimes.\n\n20:25.480 --> 20:31.480\n So I talk about love quite a bit. And you mentioned that romantic love. I'm fascinated\n\n20:31.480 --> 20:41.480\n about love in many aspects. But you mentioned romantic love was forbidden in North Korea.\n\n20:41.480 --> 20:47.480\n What do you think about love now that you've kind of discovered it? What's the role of\n\n20:47.480 --> 20:53.480\n love in life? So why do you think it was forbidden in North Korea?\n\n20:53.480 --> 20:58.480\n So the tragic thing about North Korea is not only just banning Shakespeare, like we don't\n\n20:58.480 --> 21:03.480\n even know what Romeo and Juliet is, right? Our movies is never about love stories. But\n\n21:03.480 --> 21:11.480\n then also they banned the love between mother and daughter, wife and husband, and between\n\n21:11.480 --> 21:17.480\n your friends. They deny you being a human. So only love that I knew was when I described\n\n21:17.480 --> 21:23.480\n my feeling towards the leader and in a written form. That was the only love that people know\n\n21:23.480 --> 21:29.480\n in North Korea. And now I'm like, there are many loves you can experience. I think you\n\n21:29.480 --> 21:35.480\n definitely love science, right? But imagine that if you're being denied that. So there\n\n21:35.480 --> 21:41.480\n are so many loves in life. But in North Korea, all of those things are denied. And I think\n\n21:41.480 --> 21:48.480\n for me, love is what makes you tick. Like, you know, love for your child, love for your\n\n21:48.480 --> 21:55.480\n parents, love for your friends, love for even yourself. That is denied. So I mean, many\n\n21:55.480 --> 22:00.480\n people say like, love is an option. But like, then why do you live? I think we live to love.\n\n22:00.480 --> 22:06.480\n And it doesn't have to be romantic love. It can be anything. But finding love in any person\n\n22:06.480 --> 22:11.480\n or in any subject, I think that's a goal. I think that's when people find meaning in\n\n22:11.480 --> 22:12.480\n something.\n\n22:12.480 --> 22:19.480\n Yeah, I think romantic love is just one sort of, one echo of some core thing. Yeah, science,\n\n22:19.480 --> 22:25.480\n I love science, I love robots, all of those things. And it sounds like deliberately or\n\n22:25.480 --> 22:33.480\n not, the North Korean regime wants to channel that very deep aspect of the human spirit\n\n22:33.480 --> 22:35.480\n all towards the leader.\n\n22:35.480 --> 22:42.480\n Yeah, that's it. That's the only thing they allow us to fear and know about. So I remember,\n\n22:42.480 --> 22:48.480\n I mean, you read 1984 by George Orwell, it talks about double think and double speak,\n\n22:48.480 --> 22:54.480\n who controls the language, who controls thoughts. And why he does talk about as they go, they\n\n22:54.480 --> 23:00.480\n eliminate a lot of words, right? Now, later one word can represent 10 different things.\n\n23:00.480 --> 23:08.480\n And what fascinates me is how many vocabulary meaning people can have. And when I literally\n\n23:08.480 --> 23:14.480\n came out, I remember I went to San Francisco, and someone came to me and hugged me. And\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:19.480\n then he was a guy like, oh, baby, don't worry, I'm gay. I was like, what the heck is gay?\n\n23:19.480 --> 23:24.480\n And then I literally had to go to a hotel room and Google the gay. And it's like, oh,\n\n23:24.480 --> 23:30.480\n that's what you meant. And like that, like, they deny what that is. I'm sure there are\n\n23:30.480 --> 23:36.480\n gays in North Korea. I'm sure there is. But you don't know what it is. And like that,\n\n23:36.480 --> 23:42.480\n they eliminate words. So the fact that you know the concept, that stays much better than\n\n23:42.480 --> 23:46.480\n and that's the thing a lot of people like when you're born, you somehow know what justice\n\n23:46.480 --> 23:52.480\n is, what liberty is. And it's all somebody taught you that. And like, that's the thing\n\n23:52.480 --> 23:57.480\n why people say, oh, humans are inherently know what is right, what is wrong, what is\n\n23:57.480 --> 24:02.480\n oppression. And like, no, that's like BS. You got to learn.\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:10.480\n That's fascinating that words give rise to ideas. So like, as a child, one of the ways\n\n24:10.480 --> 24:15.480\n to learn about justice and freedom is to first learn the word, and then to ask, well, what\n\n24:15.480 --> 24:20.480\n is it? Yeah, the concept. Yeah. And if you don't have the word for it, then you never\n\n24:20.480 --> 24:25.480\n have the kind of first spark that leads to you trying to be curious about it. That's\n\n24:25.480 --> 24:30.480\n interesting and controlling the words. And then, yeah, I mean, your thoughts, you control\n\n24:30.480 --> 24:37.480\n the thoughts. There's so many echoes. I mean, I have, it's a very different, but perhaps\n\n24:37.480 --> 24:44.480\n a very similar experience, which is the journey of my family through the Soviet Union. Because\n\n24:44.480 --> 24:49.480\n there is a love of country. There is a pride of the people. Like you are proud of your\n\n24:49.480 --> 24:57.480\n family in general. But I wonder how much of that is polluted by the propaganda.\n\n24:57.480 --> 25:06.480\n I think a lot. For sure. Yeah. It is to this day, I'm like, my father who died in China\n\n25:06.480 --> 25:13.480\n and he was tortured and then he died. He wanted to go back before his death, right? And then\n\n25:13.480 --> 25:18.480\n it's like, dad, if you go back, you're going to be executed. And it's like, I want to be\n\n25:18.480 --> 25:24.480\n executed. He wanted to go back to North Korea. To be executed. So he can be buried in his\n\n25:24.480 --> 25:32.480\n own land. And then his last wish was, if I die, criminate me and then bring my ashes\n\n25:32.480 --> 25:38.480\n back to my country. When I'm dead, I still want to be in my country. And this is nationalism.\n\n25:38.480 --> 25:45.480\n This is a propaganda, right? But now it's the same thing. It's the same thing. If I\n\n25:45.480 --> 25:52.480\n die, I somehow buried in my land and I still feel like I'm the outsider. I'm always longing\n\n25:52.480 --> 25:57.480\n for my home. It's a horrible home. People say, what's your dream? Do you want to be\n\n25:57.480 --> 26:02.480\n a president? Do you want to run for office? I just want to go home. That's my dream.\n\n26:02.480 --> 26:10.480\n And people here don't get it ever. I don't know what to do with that. I love my country.\n\n26:10.480 --> 26:16.480\n And I think for me, my country is the United States. And perhaps it will be for you too\n\n26:16.480 --> 26:21.480\n one day. It is. I think it's becoming. US has been a very special place in my heart.\n\n26:21.480 --> 26:28.480\n I think this is the first place I felt like I feel like home. And I mean, I was in South\n\n26:28.480 --> 26:33.480\n Korea longer and I didn't feel that way. So I think we have very different life stories,\n\n26:33.480 --> 26:38.480\n but I think it's almost two different people. For me, it's the person that was in the Soviet\n\n26:38.480 --> 26:44.480\n Union and the person that's here. Those are two different people. That previous person's\n\n26:44.480 --> 26:53.480\n home in the Soviet Union and he's part of me. And I suppose in that same way, your first\n\n26:53.480 --> 27:00.480\n maybe two decades of life are somehow longing for the home that is North Korea. And your\n\n27:00.480 --> 27:08.480\n next two decades of life might be finding a home in the United States. Your dad, can\n\n27:08.480 --> 27:19.480\n you tell the story of his struggle, of his death? I mean, first, do you miss him? Do\n\n27:19.480 --> 27:27.480\n you think about it? Oh man, all the time. I had a son when I was 22 and I had IVF three\n\n27:27.480 --> 27:33.480\n times. And as you see, I'm like 80 pounds, but back then I was like 75 pounds. And because\n\n27:33.480 --> 27:42.480\n of my severe malnutrition, somehow my body's very different. And so after three times of\n\n27:42.480 --> 27:49.480\n IVF after 23, I was still wanting family. And the reason I wanted him is because I felt\n\n27:49.480 --> 27:56.480\n so guilty for my father that he never seen this world. I somehow, when you're so desperate,\n\n27:56.480 --> 28:02.480\n you become illogical. Like I want to believe in the, like Buddhist idea, right? You come\n\n28:02.480 --> 28:08.480\n back to life. And I prayed, please come to me, like as my son, so I will take care of\n\n28:08.480 --> 28:14.480\n you. Like come back. And when I was pregnant with my son, even though I planned to get\n\n28:14.480 --> 28:21.480\n pregnant with a girl, doctor made a mistake. It became a boy. So I made his middle name,\n\n28:21.480 --> 28:29.480\n like my father's name Jin Sik. I think he's the only American got North Korean name. It\n\n28:29.480 --> 28:37.480\n is. So he's a part of your father's and your son. Yeah. That's how I, that's how I make\n\n28:37.480 --> 28:44.480\n a sense of it. And that's how I move forward. Like if I, like as a logical human being,\n\n28:44.480 --> 28:48.480\n you, you know, when you're dead, you're done. Maybe that's what I at least used to think,\n\n28:48.480 --> 28:54.480\n but then life's become too unbearable. And somehow that's the thing, like we tell ourselves\n\n28:54.480 --> 28:58.480\n stories in order to live. And that's how I came with my title of the book in order to\n\n28:58.480 --> 29:04.480\n live. I had to tell myself a lot of stories to overcome a lot of things. I think I was\n\n29:04.480 --> 29:15.480\n a part of it. Can you tell the story of you escaping North Korea to China? Yeah, I think\n\n29:15.480 --> 29:26.480\n it's, it's a thing. It's amazing. Even though I was like 13, my like life outside of North\n\n29:26.480 --> 29:32.480\n Korea is almost like went by like one second and my life till that point was like eternity.\n\n29:32.480 --> 29:40.480\n I remember being in China. I arrived there at the end of March at 13. And by October,\n\n29:40.480 --> 29:49.480\n it was six months past. And I literally felt like I lived eternity. And one day living\n\n29:49.480 --> 29:56.480\n in China felt like living one year. One day was a war like surviving through one day was\n\n29:56.480 --> 30:02.480\n so hard. Every night I was like, I cannot believe I got done one day today. That was\n\n30:02.480 --> 30:08.480\n a thing I was grateful for before I went to bed. Okay, I survived. I didn't get captured.\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:16.480\n And I made it another day on earth. So the experience of the minutes is what fear, fear\n\n30:16.480 --> 30:26.480\n of being captured, fear, loss, everything. Because I mean, I saw my own mom in China\n\n30:26.480 --> 30:35.480\n to survive to. So it was more than that. And it's not feeling I think that's a thing in\n\n30:35.480 --> 30:44.480\n China. I learned not to fear. And after my escape was a challenging, I didn't feel anything.\n\n30:44.480 --> 30:50.480\n And it was hard. Not feeling anything is a torture. It's the biggest torture you can\n\n30:50.480 --> 30:57.480\n ever feel like even you fear sadness. That's better than not feeling anything. And I felt\n\n30:57.480 --> 31:03.480\n something when I had my son. That's when I started healing. So he was a miracle to save\n\n31:03.480 --> 31:08.480\n me. But yeah, in China, it wasn't even fear like it was numb.\n\n31:08.480 --> 31:15.480\n You were numb. It was like paralysis. Yeah. Just overwhelming on the uncertainty of your\n\n31:15.480 --> 31:19.480\n future. Did you have a sense what your future held at the time?\n\n31:19.480 --> 31:24.480\n Like what do you even even feature? I don't even know that word. Right? Like, a lot of\n\n31:24.480 --> 31:29.480\n times I was looking at myself like I left my body and like just looking at me. And just\n\n31:29.480 --> 31:34.480\n not feeling it. It's not like I'm scared for her. I'm like sad for her just looking at\n\n31:34.480 --> 31:42.480\n me like, huh, that's interesting. Wow. Not feeling anything. And me like being raped,\n\n31:42.480 --> 31:49.480\n going through every emotion of life to survive, right? But like, somehow, I don't know if\n\n31:49.480 --> 31:55.480\n you say so or something like looking at it just like, you feel nothing. You don't feel\n\n31:55.480 --> 32:03.480\n anything for that person. So even with your mom, like what was, was there some, I don't\n\n32:03.480 --> 32:10.480\n know, some warmth that you were able to extract from the connection with your mom? Yeah, of\n\n32:10.480 --> 32:17.480\n course. I think that made me survive. I had a very strong connection with my family. And\n\n32:17.480 --> 32:23.480\n I think that's what kept me going to do all of that. I think, as you said, I escaped at\n\n32:23.480 --> 32:31.480\n 13. My sister at the age of 16 escaped with her friend first. And I was going to escape\n\n32:31.480 --> 32:37.480\n with her. But one day I got like really bad stomach ache. And my parents took me to hospital.\n\n32:37.480 --> 32:41.480\n And in North Korean hospital, they don't have like X ray machines. They don't even have\n\n32:41.480 --> 32:47.480\n electricity. They literally using one needle to inject everybody. And people don't die\n\n32:47.480 --> 32:53.480\n from cancer in North Korea. You die from infection and fever and hunger, right? So most likely\n\n32:53.480 --> 32:57.480\n you're going to die more by being treated by doctor than not being treated. I think\n\n32:57.480 --> 33:02.480\n I was lucky. Even though they thought I had appendix, they operated on me without any\n\n33:02.480 --> 33:09.480\n painkiller. And I didn't get infection. I survived. So that's how I got delayed to escape\n\n33:09.480 --> 33:16.480\n with my sister. And she left me a note in my bedside saying like, follow this lady.\n\n33:16.480 --> 33:21.480\n And this is like another trick about human trafficking, right? She sold me to China as\n\n33:21.480 --> 33:29.480\n a sexual slave. And she executed for it later. She was executed for that later. She had five\n\n33:29.480 --> 33:35.480\n daughters and she sold all her children to China. And we can now sitting here judging\n\n33:35.480 --> 33:41.480\n on like how heartless you are selling your own children to China. And as a sexual slave,\n\n33:41.480 --> 33:46.480\n they were like her children were seven, 10 years old. But that was the only way for her\n\n33:46.480 --> 33:53.480\n to save her children. And if she didn't sell me that day, I would be dead right now. So\n\n33:53.480 --> 33:59.480\n I'm grateful that she sold me. And I think that's the thing is like, life is so crazy.\n\n33:59.480 --> 34:06.480\n You cannot judge. It is so complex. And yeah, that's how she changed my life by selling\n\n34:06.480 --> 34:10.480\n me. She sold my mom and myself in 2007 to China.\n\n34:10.480 --> 34:14.480\n So you're grateful for that. You're grateful for that suffering.\n\n34:14.480 --> 34:16.480\n Of course I am grateful.\n\n34:16.480 --> 34:18.480\n Because the alternative is worse.\n\n34:18.480 --> 34:24.480\n I would not be here with you. You would never knew I existed.\n\n34:24.480 --> 34:29.480\n What do you make of the others suffering in the world today? The people there in North\n\n34:29.480 --> 34:39.480\n Korea. So that is part of your life's work is helping those people. What do you think\n\n34:39.480 --> 34:42.480\n about them? What should people know about them?\n\n34:42.480 --> 34:46.480\n I think that's when I get angry. Whenever I think about them.\n\n34:46.480 --> 34:48.480\n Who's your anger directed at?\n\n34:48.480 --> 35:00.480\n At the heartlessness of people, the ignorance of people. So when I got out of North Korea,\n\n35:00.480 --> 35:07.480\n I went through all of that. And I went to South Korea one day. I was watching television\n\n35:07.480 --> 35:15.480\n and there's like famous Korean Kpop stars crying and doing some fundraising concert.\n\n35:15.480 --> 35:19.480\n And I literally thought, oh my God, something is horribly going wrong in this country. Why\n\n35:19.480 --> 35:26.480\n are these people crying? It was a cheery campaign. And then later it was showing that it was\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:33.480\n an animal rights campaign to helping out cats and puppies in the shelters.\n\n35:33.480 --> 35:39.480\n Do you know anybody sheds their tears like that to another human being right now? No,\n\n35:39.480 --> 35:44.480\n right? People rather give millions of dollars to save some dolphins than saving these children\n\n35:44.480 --> 35:52.480\n right now being raped in China. And I think I love Elon Musk. I love his voice. I love\n\n35:52.480 --> 35:57.480\n these people want to go to the moon, Mars. And then people told him like, yeah, we went\n\n35:57.480 --> 36:01.480\n to the moon like I did not know in North Korea.\n\n36:01.480 --> 36:06.480\n But I think that's what upsets me. Why there is not even one single human with that kind\n\n36:06.480 --> 36:13.480\n of brilliance in their brain. They can save so much suffering, but nobody does anything.\n\n36:13.480 --> 36:20.480\n I think that's when I feel like hard to find hope in humanity. And that's when I get so\n\n36:20.480 --> 36:26.480\n upset. Because think about like even Biden or Trump or Obama. They know what's happening\n\n36:26.480 --> 36:31.480\n in North Korea exactly, right? I mean, we see satellite photos. There's public executions.\n\n36:31.480 --> 36:37.480\n I mean, the UN says this is a Holocaust happening again. And it's happening. If the Holocaust\n\n36:37.480 --> 36:43.480\n is happening again, how, why, how are you okay doing nothing about it? But somehow humans\n\n36:43.480 --> 36:51.480\n are able to okay nothing, anything. And this is like, this is hard. Like when people say\n\n36:51.480 --> 36:56.480\n I'm going to change the world. I want to make a difference. Like it's hard to believe it,\n\n36:56.480 --> 36:57.480\n you know?\n\n36:57.480 --> 37:02.480\n Yeah, that we can turn our back to human suffering at scale when it's right in front of us. I\n\n37:02.480 --> 37:08.480\n mean, that makes you think about the Holocaust. This is just, everybody was looking the other\n\n37:08.480 --> 37:12.480\n way because it was almost too hard to look at it.\n\n37:12.480 --> 37:17.480\n No, it's not. It's an easier thing. Like that's the thing. I was like here to speak at the\n\n37:17.480 --> 37:21.480\n South by Southwest a few years ago. And like they're, everybody's talking about like Elon\n\n37:21.480 --> 37:26.480\n Musk project going to the moon, right? We're going to be multi, like species. I was like\n\n37:26.480 --> 37:32.480\n back then I didn't even know who he was. So if you guys are trying to go out to this earth,\n\n37:32.480 --> 37:37.480\n you haven't even explored our earth yet. You cannot go to North Korea right now. You haven't\n\n37:37.480 --> 37:43.480\n explored that part of our, our like planet. Can we do that first and then move on?\n\n37:43.480 --> 37:49.480\n Explore the landscape of human suffering, like alleviate suffering in the world. There's\n\n37:49.480 --> 37:55.480\n a lot of suffering happening in Africa that has to do with disease. And for some reason\n\n37:55.480 --> 38:01.480\n it's, even though we turn our back to that kind of suffering too, we still can try to\n\n38:01.480 --> 38:08.480\n do something about it. And there's still efforts in terms of healthcare, in terms of medicine,\n\n38:08.480 --> 38:13.480\n in terms of bioengineering, in terms of like all these efforts to help people from disease.\n\n38:13.480 --> 38:17.480\n But like, that's almost like converting it into an engineering problem and trying to\n\n38:17.480 --> 38:24.480\n solve it. That somehow is easier for us humans. But when there's obvious sort of non disease\n\n38:24.480 --> 38:34.480\n related torture of humans, we look the other way. Whether it's China or it's North Korea.\n\n38:34.480 --> 38:40.480\n Yeah. I mean, that has to be changed somehow. We have to change that somehow.\n\n38:40.480 --> 38:45.480\n It's the thing right now, like the China, like they bring the Xinjiang riggers, right?\n\n38:45.480 --> 38:51.480\n They say, oh, this is a vitamin, take it. And then it kills their sperm and make them\n\n38:51.480 --> 38:56.480\n not reproduce. Their birth rate gone down something 47 to something 50% in the one year\n\n38:56.480 --> 39:02.480\n time. It's a genocide in 21st century. And they get those people and get their like organs\n\n39:02.480 --> 39:08.480\n out. Imagine if there's some people who do that with the cutie puppies and cats. There's\n\n39:08.480 --> 39:14.480\n going to be insane amount of product. They're going to destroy everything. And this is like\n\n39:14.480 --> 39:20.480\n a human nature that I don't get. Why there's so much anti human sentiment in this modern\n\n39:20.480 --> 39:26.480\n world? We don't have to. The fact that I was saying like, the fact that you care about\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:31.480\n animals rights is beautiful because you care about something who cannot speak for themselves.\n\n39:31.480 --> 39:35.480\n The fact that we care about animals is because they cannot speak for themselves, right? They\n\n39:35.480 --> 39:40.480\n don't have that ability. And there are many people who cannot speak for themselves right\n\n39:40.480 --> 39:45.480\n now. And why do you refuse to be the voice for them? Because they are simply being a\n\n39:45.480 --> 39:53.480\n human. And maybe it connects to us not being proud of who we are. Like, I don't know what\n\n39:53.480 --> 39:59.480\n it is. Why do they deny humans this way? Maybe they don't like themselves.\n\n39:59.480 --> 40:05.480\n Yeah, it's almost, we would have to acknowledge some dark things about ourselves in order\n\n40:05.480 --> 40:16.480\n to start helping. What's the solution? So, you know, I see two solutions. One is in the\n\n40:16.480 --> 40:28.480\n military side. It's assassination or the full on invasion. And then on the activism side,\n\n40:28.480 --> 40:38.480\n which is figuring out ways to, like you said, sort of let people in North Korea understand\n\n40:38.480 --> 40:44.480\n their situation, sort of from within try to reform. Or maybe there's others, obviously,\n\n40:44.480 --> 40:50.480\n there could be activism from the outside to build up momentum for the entirety of the\n\n40:50.480 --> 40:56.480\n world, especially the world that is not just the United States or Europe, but also is Russia\n\n40:56.480 --> 41:05.480\n and China and so on. What are your ideas here? What we can do as individuals and as countries?\n\n41:05.480 --> 41:10.480\n I think the first thing that we can do is speak about Chinese role in this sponsoring\n\n41:10.480 --> 41:16.480\n dictatorship in North Korea. Like, I happen to have so much struggle talking about North\n\n41:16.480 --> 41:21.480\n Korea, right? They say, how North Korea is possible? Why is it like the way like this\n\n41:21.480 --> 41:30.480\n is 99% accountability going to CCP? Kim Jong Un cannot last without Chinese help even one\n\n41:30.480 --> 41:36.480\n week. This is completely funded. This Holocaust is funded by CCP. But if you talk about in\n\n41:36.480 --> 41:42.480\n the mainstream, of course, they don't buy it. And I think it's in a way North Korea\n\n41:42.480 --> 41:47.480\n is a lot easier to solve than even in the Middle East. There's nothing conflict like\n\n41:47.480 --> 41:52.480\n between people. There's no ideology, no religion, nothing. People are peaceful, right? There's\n\n41:52.480 --> 41:59.480\n not even one civil, like any discontent among the people. Our problem is there's a dictator\n\n41:59.480 --> 42:05.480\n funded by the second economic power in the world. And even any military, they know if\n\n42:05.480 --> 42:09.480\n they kill Kim Jong Un, they're going to get killed by Chinese. Nobody can dare to stand\n\n42:09.480 --> 42:16.480\n up against Kim Jong Un because China is backing it. So somehow here in the West, we collectively\n\n42:16.480 --> 42:21.480\n acknowledging that China is the responsible person for these crimes against humanity in\n\n42:21.480 --> 42:26.480\n North Korea. Then we can somehow, I don't know, talk to them.\n\n42:26.480 --> 42:27.480\n Stand up to China.\n\n42:27.480 --> 42:28.480\n Exactly.\n\n42:28.480 --> 42:35.480\n We're failing to do that in a way, in all kinds of avenues of life, of public life,\n\n42:35.480 --> 42:46.480\n because for many reasons, they're probably primarily financial. But it also, I'm against,\n\n42:46.480 --> 42:54.480\n I don't know, maybe you can correct me. I'm against sort of making China this evil enemy\n\n42:54.480 --> 43:02.480\n because I've seen this with Russia as well. And I don't think that leads to progress.\n\n43:02.480 --> 43:10.480\n I think you want to highlight, you basically want to help the Chinese people become the\n\n43:10.480 --> 43:17.480\n best version of themselves. So speak to the Chinese people and not making the leaders\n\n43:17.480 --> 43:24.480\n of China into these caricatures of devils. I feel like the Cold War, the way it was done\n\n43:24.480 --> 43:30.480\n in Russia, both sides, they were caricaturing each other through propaganda and the result\n\n43:30.480 --> 43:34.480\n was not productive at all. It did not help Russia become the best country it could be.\n\n43:34.480 --> 43:38.480\n It did not help America become the best country it could be. And the same thing with China.\n\n43:38.480 --> 43:45.480\n I feel like making them into this enemy, like being afraid of China, making them into the\n\n43:45.480 --> 43:49.480\n thing that's going to spy on us, that's going to destroy the rest of the world, that's not\n\n43:49.480 --> 43:55.480\n going to help China reform themselves. They're going to plant their feet. The dictators,\n\n43:55.480 --> 44:01.480\n the evil people will become more evil. The power hungry will become more, like they will\n\n44:01.480 --> 44:08.480\n centralize the power more. It feels like, maybe naive, but it feels like it should be\n\n44:08.480 --> 44:15.480\n like, again, love, not violence that solves this thing. Now, of course, in North Korea,\n\n44:15.480 --> 44:23.480\n it's like long gone. 80 years, almost 80 years. Love is not going to solve that problem.\n\n44:23.480 --> 44:26.480\n I mean, I don't, it's very difficult.\n\n44:26.480 --> 44:32.480\n They have tried that because of the sunshine policy, which is there's two people walking\n\n44:32.480 --> 44:37.480\n down the street and the sun and the wind made a battle. So who can take off that man, take\n\n44:37.480 --> 44:43.480\n off jacket? So wind tried to blow as much air as he could. And then that man was like\n\n44:43.480 --> 44:47.480\n putting more like his jacket on, right? Not taking off, but sunshine came. Okay, I'm going\n\n44:47.480 --> 44:51.480\n to give him a lot of warmth. And then he took his jacket out and came out. So that was the\n\n44:51.480 --> 44:56.480\n theory. Let's give North Korea as much love as they want. Let's give them a lot of money,\n\n44:56.480 --> 45:00.480\n whatever they want, let's give to them so they know that we are not here to attack them.\n\n45:00.480 --> 45:05.480\n And North Korea, what they did was the guy who did the sunshine policy in South Korea\n\n45:05.480 --> 45:11.480\n named Kim Dae Sung won the Nobel Peace Prize for that. And Kim Jong Il used the money to\n\n45:11.480 --> 45:17.480\n build nuclear weapons. So that's how they came with the nukes. So I think that's the\n\n45:17.480 --> 45:20.480\n thing. I hope that love solves problems.\n\n45:20.480 --> 45:25.480\n But there's got to be a way and the hope is with the 21st century is you can directly\n\n45:25.480 --> 45:29.480\n speak to the people somehow. When there's no internet, when there's nothing like that,\n\n45:29.480 --> 45:34.480\n it's hopeless. I think China, there's a hope that China is still connected to the internet.\n\n45:34.480 --> 45:43.480\n I love your optimism. I have seen the actual dark side of China on the underground. I hope,\n\n45:43.480 --> 45:48.480\n I think that's the thing. People in the West, right? They say, oh, how can it be that bad?\n\n45:48.480 --> 45:56.480\n They ask me like, I walking passing this young teenager man and later the war with my sister.\n\n45:56.480 --> 46:03.480\n He's like intestine coming out through his back, right? And even in that moment, what\n\n46:03.480 --> 46:06.480\n he wanted was, please give me food. He was hungry.\n\n46:06.480 --> 46:11.480\n His intestine is hanging out of his body and he's asking for food.\n\n46:11.480 --> 46:17.480\n Do you know what humans demand when they die in North Korea? All they want is eating, right?\n\n46:17.480 --> 46:18.480\n Yeah.\n\n46:18.480 --> 46:24.480\n And people say, oh, nothing can be that bad. But people just here haven't seen an actual\n\n46:24.480 --> 46:26.480\n true evil.\n\n46:26.480 --> 46:31.480\n Would you say that the evil comes from a tiny minority of people or is it permeate much\n\n46:31.480 --> 46:40.480\n larger parts of the population? Like if we look at sex trafficking, how many people,\n\n46:40.480 --> 46:54.480\n like is it 99.9% of the people are longing to do good in the world? Or is there, is it,\n\n46:54.480 --> 46:58.480\n or do we all have the capacity for evil in certain kinds of environments, certain kinds\n\n46:58.480 --> 47:05.480\n of governmental structures inspire a large percent of the population to do bad things?\n\n47:05.480 --> 47:11.480\n I think humans are capable of anything. There's no exception. I don't think there's any saint\n\n47:11.480 --> 47:17.480\n who born with that morality. I think in North Korea, you can say initially that there's\n\n47:17.480 --> 47:24.480\n few guys in the top wanted the power and then doing this, but eventually made a society\n\n47:24.480 --> 47:29.480\n where people don't even know what compassion is. We don't know the concept of, we don't\n\n47:29.480 --> 47:33.480\n know that you need to feel bad for another human being when they're suffering. The fact\n\n47:33.480 --> 47:39.480\n that you know compassion is in your knowledge. That's why you do that. Humans need to learn.\n\n47:39.480 --> 47:44.480\n It's not anything bad about human nature. It's just saying humans are capable of everything.\n\n47:44.480 --> 47:50.480\n We are the most adaptable species on the planet. That's why we created the internet, like\n\n47:50.480 --> 47:55.480\n talking this way, right? No other animals have done it because we are so adaptable.\n\n47:55.480 --> 48:01.480\n That is a good thing and that's a bad thing. So in the adaptive situation, they all can\n\n48:01.480 --> 48:06.480\n be, I mean during the Holocaust, right? Those people, they could have been capable of good\n\n48:06.480 --> 48:12.480\n too if they were exposed to different system. That's why when people underestimate evil,\n\n48:12.480 --> 48:19.480\n that's what scares me. Evil is evil. It's a different thing. It's a completely different\n\n48:19.480 --> 48:26.480\n thing. Of course, I get your idea. We don't want to isolate 1.3 billion human beings on\n\n48:26.480 --> 48:32.480\n Earth by Chinese, but the thing is we are talking about this regime, not the people.\n\n48:32.480 --> 48:37.480\n I love Chinese people. I speak Chinese. I love all about the country, but this system\n\n48:37.480 --> 48:43.480\n does promote evil. Well, that's an optimistic view actually because we can fix systems.\n\n48:43.480 --> 48:48.480\n Yeah. It's harder to fix people. So if we fix systems, then the people are adaptable,\n\n48:48.480 --> 48:53.480\n as you said. Absolutely. I mean that, and then the question is, first of all, you have\n\n48:53.480 --> 48:58.480\n to talk about it just as you're doing. You're right now like this little flame that burns\n\n48:58.480 --> 49:07.480\n bright, and it's really important for North Korea, but just keep talking about it until\n\n49:07.480 --> 49:13.480\n hopefully it leads to at the highest levels of power, revolutionizing the systems in the\n\n49:13.480 --> 49:21.480\n world. And then in China and in North Korea, do you see North Korea being a potential instigator\n\n49:21.480 --> 49:28.480\n in nuclear war? They will not start a nuclear war as long as they can do whatever they want\n\n49:28.480 --> 49:35.480\n right now, right? North Korea's army is not designed to fight the enemy. They're designed\n\n49:35.480 --> 49:40.480\n to prevent their own people, the coup d'tetre and the revolution with their own citizens.\n\n49:40.480 --> 49:46.480\n That is 1.6 million North Korea with a tiny country, the fourth largest armies in the\n\n49:46.480 --> 49:54.480\n world. So this country is designed to fight with their own citizens. And the army, the\n\n49:54.480 --> 50:00.480\n fourth largest in the world, is designed to basically fight its own people. Oppress their\n\n50:00.480 --> 50:10.480\n own people. That's what North Korean military is about. Okay. Let me ask you some aspects\n\n50:10.480 --> 50:16.480\n about North Korean life. Can you describe the songbun system of ascribed status used\n\n50:16.480 --> 50:21.480\n in North Korea? Yeah. So that's a very interesting thing, right? Right now there are a lot of\n\n50:21.480 --> 50:26.480\n people playing with this ideology of like democratic socialism, socialism, communism,\n\n50:26.480 --> 50:31.480\n whatever you call it, Marxism, Leninism, right? They have all like these similar features\n\n50:31.480 --> 50:38.480\n where we give collective power to a certain entity and they will make the decision for\n\n50:38.480 --> 50:44.480\n bigger good, right? And North Korea came up with the idea, the Kim Il Sung. He was the\n\n50:44.480 --> 50:49.480\n Leninist. He was a Marxist saying, I'm going to create the most equal society on human\n\n50:49.480 --> 50:56.480\n face. So it was communist North Korea. And then they came up with this songbun system.\n\n50:56.480 --> 51:04.480\n It's like family caste system. Three big categories, warrior, wavering, and hostile. And that in\n\n51:04.480 --> 51:09.480\n between three classes, they divide into 50 different classes. So a lot of people don't\n\n51:09.480 --> 51:14.480\n even know which exact class you belong to. That's a secret government document. And that's\n\n51:14.480 --> 51:20.480\n how they decide your future. So in a way, North Korea, before you're born, your life\n\n51:20.480 --> 51:25.480\n is determined for you. And this is a joke, right? They dreamed of creating the most equal\n\n51:25.480 --> 51:31.480\n society. They ended up with became most unequal society in the face of humanity. So there\n\n51:31.480 --> 51:38.480\n are 50 different classes and where the one guy on the top became a god. So when this\n\n51:38.480 --> 51:42.480\n animal farm, as we keep saying, like there's so many, all the animals are equal and some\n\n51:42.480 --> 51:46.480\n of the animals are more equal than others. Exactly. But it's not only, it's just more\n\n51:46.480 --> 51:54.480\n equal. One guy in North Korea became a god. So North Korea was born out of a Marxist ideals.\n\n51:54.480 --> 52:06.480\n Yeah. From Stalin. Can you comment on Juche ideology, which seems to be its own kind of\n\n52:06.480 --> 52:15.480\n socialism, but with unique aspects here, it really does ideologically says the importance\n\n52:15.480 --> 52:21.480\n of having a great leader. Is there some interesting similarities or differences that you can comment\n\n52:21.480 --> 52:27.480\n on between other implementations of communism throughout history, the Soviet Union, China,\n\n52:27.480 --> 52:33.480\n elsewhere? So Juche is very unique. It came on around the 90s after Soviet Union collapsed.\n\n52:33.480 --> 52:39.480\n So before that, North Korea was very still loyal to the Marxism and Leninism, which is\n\n52:39.480 --> 52:45.480\n state takes care of you. We are going to give you the right education, healthcare, your\n\n52:45.480 --> 52:49.480\n livelihood, everybody is going to be equal. You're going to have in the working collective\n\n52:49.480 --> 52:55.480\n farm, collective worker place. Everybody collectively do things together and let's work for the\n\n52:55.480 --> 53:02.480\n paradise. But 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. And until then, North Korea was heavily subsidized\n\n53:02.480 --> 53:07.480\n by Soviet Union's aid. And then Soviet Union didn't give them anything. So not 3 million\n\n53:07.480 --> 53:13.480\n people dying on the streets. The regime then came up with the idea, okay, our goal is what\n\n53:13.480 --> 53:19.480\n is successful ruling for us is keeping the 10% of population alive, which is in the capital\n\n53:19.480 --> 53:26.480\n Pyongyang. So they designed the hunger games. There is a capital, 13 other districts, everybody\n\n53:26.480 --> 53:32.480\n on the countryside on purpose being starved. So those people who are starving cannot thinking\n\n53:32.480 --> 53:36.480\n about meaning of life, cannot thinking about shooting to the moon, right? They're not going\n\n53:36.480 --> 53:40.480\n to think about anything or they're going to think it's like finding next meal. All on\n\n53:40.480 --> 53:45.480\n purpose. All on purpose is manmade famine. International community was begging to give\n\n53:45.480 --> 53:52.480\n North Korea food. Why not? Still at the UN, they beg to give North Korea formula, medicine\n\n53:52.480 --> 53:56.480\n and food. They are begging, can you please feed your people? And Kim Jong Un said, no,\n\n53:56.480 --> 54:01.480\n thank you. Last year, like when North Korea had a horrible, horrible flooding, South Korean\n\n54:01.480 --> 54:06.480\n president begging, can you get, can I give you please some medicines? Like, no, because\n\n54:06.480 --> 54:10.480\n he wants to be the one provider. He doesn't want people to think other people giving him\n\n54:10.480 --> 54:15.480\n the thing. So on purpose, other people are starving. And that Juche idea is that's when\n\n54:15.480 --> 54:20.480\n it's coming from. So until that communism was about like state is being a father figure,\n\n54:20.480 --> 54:25.480\n takes care of all your needs, right? Give the power to us and you're all good. But North\n\n54:25.480 --> 54:30.480\n Korea regime says, okay, now we cannot give people's ration. So which means Juche means\n\n54:30.480 --> 54:37.480\n self reliance. You need to take care of yourself while you're giving every right to us. So\n\n54:37.480 --> 54:43.480\n now in the 90s, the regime told us, okay, we are not going to give you ration. You cannot\n\n54:43.480 --> 54:49.480\n trade. That's illegal, but you find your own way to survive. So be self reliant. That's\n\n54:49.480 --> 54:54.480\n what Juche is. But when you're a guy, you can do whatever you want. You don't need to\n\n54:54.480 --> 55:00.480\n make a sense. That's the difference being a God and being a leader. When it is religion,\n\n55:00.480 --> 55:06.480\n it's not for survival. You cannot challenge it. God's way is suspicious. God works in\n\n55:06.480 --> 55:11.480\n a mysterious way. So when you're a God, people are not going to say, oh, this doesn't make\n\n55:11.480 --> 55:16.480\n sense, right? You're going to, okay, whatever God says, as a human being, we can never change\n\n55:16.480 --> 55:20.480\n his thought. It's unbelievable what regimes can do.\n\n55:20.480 --> 55:39.480\n There's something about famine that is another level of evil to me. What Stalin did in Ukraine\n\n55:39.480 --> 55:51.480\n in the thirties, fuck them. This is what torture is. Cannibalism.\n\n55:51.480 --> 55:58.480\n North Korea too, they eat humans right now in 21st century. 7 billion people on this\n\n55:58.480 --> 56:04.480\n earth right now. You make enough food for 10 billion people. Nobody should be starving\n\n56:04.480 --> 56:10.480\n right now. It's worrisome to me. The humanity is moving forward with the technological advance,\n\n56:10.480 --> 56:15.480\n blah, blah, blah. We are going so fast in advancement. And we are leaving this like\n\n56:15.480 --> 56:21.480\n 25 million human beings in the cage, completely leaving them behind. And North Korea is living\n\n56:21.480 --> 56:28.480\n like 16 centuries. This morning I was taking shower, beautiful shower. One never knew what\n\n56:28.480 --> 56:34.480\n shower was. I was bathing a few times a year, going to the river. How do they even know\n\n56:34.480 --> 56:40.480\n what shampoo is? And this is how human beings in 21st century are living. And it doesn't\n\n56:40.480 --> 56:48.480\n bother us. And rather, most people are obsessed being a vegan. How do you reconcile this?\n\n56:48.480 --> 56:52.480\n I think we get used to stuff very quickly. We get used to comforts. That's just the way\n\n56:52.480 --> 56:58.480\n of human life. You take the beautiful things for granted. So I try to appreciate everything\n\n56:58.480 --> 57:05.480\n I have. So whether it's like the food I have now or like the luxury to have a diet and\n\n57:05.480 --> 57:09.480\n be struggling with that. Or just the basic simple moments of being alive with the people\n\n57:09.480 --> 57:14.480\n I love. Or actually I get like, I think I'm on drugs all the time because I feel like\n\n57:14.480 --> 57:22.480\n just even like this mug, everything on this table just brings me joy. But it's like filling\n\n57:22.480 --> 57:29.480\n your life with joy in the full capitalistic American way, you can still at the same time\n\n57:29.480 --> 57:35.480\n not feel too bad about yourself and still focus on the suffering in the world. And I\n\n57:35.480 --> 57:46.480\n think there's some way that in trying to build a better world in America, it has ripple effects\n\n57:46.480 --> 57:55.480\n elsewhere. Sort of like, so I'm a fan of rockets in space. It sounds perhaps counterintuitive\n\n57:55.480 --> 58:04.480\n but sending rockets to space will help solve the North Korea problem because it lets people\n\n58:04.480 --> 58:12.480\n dream and build cool stuff. So it's not the rocket, it's the other people that are inspired\n\n58:12.480 --> 58:17.480\n by the rocket and then look to other problems in the world. I mean, that's what Elon did\n\n58:17.480 --> 58:23.480\n is like he saw problems in the world and thought like, what can I do to help it? And I think\n\n58:23.480 --> 58:30.480\n the North Korea one is a tough one though, because that ultimately has to do with revolutionizing\n\n58:30.480 --> 58:37.480\n government. We got to change China. That's what it takes. Changing China's Communist\n\n58:37.480 --> 58:43.480\n Party is impossible. That's why we couldn't solve North Korea for that many decades. For\n\n58:43.480 --> 58:52.480\n now it's China, but it's China, it's Russia, it's certain aspects of the United States\n\n58:52.480 --> 58:59.480\n and struggling with that. There's a bunch of technologies that are striving at this.\n\n58:59.480 --> 59:04.480\n For example, I don't know what your thoughts about cryptocurrencies. I love it. So like\n\n59:04.480 --> 59:12.480\n there's a idea that money could be a way to destroy or to challenge the power centers\n\n59:12.480 --> 59:18.480\n of the world. Yeah. So if you take away the power from fiat currency and give it to this\n\n59:18.480 --> 59:21.480\n thing that can't be controlled by government, this cryptocurrency, whether it's Bitcoin,\n\n59:21.480 --> 59:26.480\n Ethereum, all those kinds of things, that's a way to get money into the hands of people\n\n59:26.480 --> 59:32.480\n to where the government can't take that money away. But North Koreans don't have electricity,\n\n59:32.480 --> 59:38.480\n no internet. So we can do that with China. We can do it with a lot of African dictatorship\n\n59:38.480 --> 59:44.480\n countries, right? I do think big cryptocurrency is such a fascinating technology, right? I\n\n59:44.480 --> 59:50.480\n think this is an amazing experiment when that power is in our hands. I'm a huge out of\n\n59:50.480 --> 59:56.480\n game believer, but I think North Korea is too behind. I think that's what is unique\n\n59:56.480 --> 1:00:01.480\n about North Korea is that most of the things that we talk about, it's a different planet\n\n1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:10.480\n literally. The common law that we have is not applicable. What about Kim Jong Un?\n\n1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:18.480\n Kim Jong Un, yeah. Is he intentionally evil or is he mindlessly propagating an evil system\n\n1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:22.480\n created by his ancestors? What's your sense of the man?\n\n1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:29.480\n So with Kim Il Sung, I can give him more benefit of that. He was a initial true believer of\n\n1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:36.480\n communism. But then as later he gained the power, he realizing, I guess back then he\n\n1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:41.480\n thought most of people are dumb, right? Individuals dumb. So therefore I need to make a decision\n\n1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:47.480\n for all of you. That pure arrogance came from out of him. Even that I can tolerate. Okay,\n\n1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:53.480\n fine. And Kim Jong Il, who never like, yeah, fine. He grew up in that system too. But Kim\n\n1:00:53.480 --> 1:01:02.480\n Jong Un is very unique. This guy was educated in Switzerland in the heart of democracy.\n\n1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:09.480\n He knew how human beings should be treated. As a child, he went, when you're a child,\n\n1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:14.480\n your brain is very susceptible, right? It will change anybody. Like why the mall was\n\n1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:19.480\n off, that's like changing young people's minds. Like that's every revolutionary they do, right?\n\n1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:25.480\n They go change young people's minds first. This guy was so obsessed with power, him being\n\n1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:31.480\n a God. Even starting in Switzerland didn't change him. And that's why I think that's\n\n1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:37.480\n a pure evil. I can give him more benefit of that to his grandfather and father. But when\n\n1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:43.480\n it comes to Kim Jong Un, this is like what pure evil looks like. Pure selfish being.\n\n1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:46.480\n That's what it looks like.\n\n1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:51.480\n Is there some sense where he's justifying everything he's doing to himself? Or do you\n\n1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:56.480\n think there's a psychopathic aspect to where he enjoys the suffering?\n\n1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:02.480\n I think in his life, right, I read a lot about like North Korea, a lot of CIA documents,\n\n1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:07.480\n a lot of intelligence people worked there. And even like worked in North Korean type\n\n1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:13.480\n elites and escaped. I could hear about them. So Kim Jong Un, when they are born, they treat\n\n1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:20.480\n like gods. So they never have a sense of them being a human. They're like equal with the\n\n1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:26.480\n others. For them, like we are just any kind of tool. Like that what Napoleon like thing\n\n1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:32.480\n does, right? Anybody is a tool. Like once boxer dies, get him slaughtered for my cause.\n\n1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:36.480\n And they do not even feel guilty about it because they don't view us that you deserve\n\n1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:41.480\n your worthy of it. Yeah, that's right. So it's not like he even feels, he doesn't even\n\n1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:48.480\n recognize that's a suffering. Like of course this is what you do serving me. Because I\n\n1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:54.480\n am, I am this. So I think that's like beyond that. It's not like suffering enters his\n\n1:02:54.480 --> 1:03:00.480\n mind. He doesn't even think what we go through. So he thinks of himself as a god. And then\n\n1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:06.480\n everybody else is just tools that they're disposable. Right. There was rumors several\n\n1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:14.480\n times of him dying. Yeah. Do you think he is, obviously his health is not good. Do you\n\n1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:21.480\n think he will die soon? What happens if Kim Jong Un dies? Well, when it comes to North\n\n1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:26.480\n Korea, anybody knows what they're going, what Kim Jong Un does is lie, right? Nobody knows.\n\n1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:32.480\n I'm sure CIA knows, but they may never reveal that. CIA has enough intelligence to can tell\n\n1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:37.480\n where Kim Jong Un is, what he's doing. They just don't assassinate him because they don't\n\n1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:42.480\n see the means of it right now. Do you think they can assassinate him? They can. They do\n\n1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:45.480\n have ability to get assassinated. Why the hell did they not assassinate him? Because\n\n1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:50.480\n they don't care. They don't care about the suffering of 25 million people. They got to\n\n1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:54.480\n pay the price. If they assassinate Kim Jong Un, they got to pay the price afterwards.\n\n1:03:54.480 --> 1:04:00.480\n There'll be financial, there'll be political price to pay. It'll anger China. Absolutely.\n\n1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:04.480\n That is a huge piece for them. And then they'll have to deal, obviously there'll be financial\n\n1:04:04.480 --> 1:04:10.480\n and military consequences of having to deal with the turmoil, the uncertainty, the revolutions\n\n1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:15.480\n that will spring up. Yeah. That's the thing. That's why they don't want to take that risk.\n\n1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:20.480\n They don't want to do anything. The US now became very passive when they pursue these\n\n1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:24.480\n moral values to the rest of the world. They did the same thing with the Holocaust in the\n\n1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:30.480\n early days, actually. Yeah. They didn't care. And that's what their policy has been. They\n\n1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:37.480\n don't care. So if Kim Jong Un dies, it's going to be very hard for North Korea to replace\n\n1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:43.480\n anybody in his position because Kim's is a brand. It's not just a leader for us, right?\n\n1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:49.480\n Whenever we think of Kim, who came with my mind, who's almost a God figure. North Korea\n\n1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:56.480\n is the number 10 religion in the world. They copied the Bible. So if you believe that,\n\n1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:01.480\n if there are people who believe in God and Jesus Christ, how do you not believe that\n\n1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:06.480\n North Koreans believe in the same thing? So Kim Il Sung's grandfather and his parents\n\n1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:14.480\n were devout Christians. So Kim Il Sung grew up this Christian like verses. So when he\n\n1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:20.480\n finding his country, he said, I love my people so much that I'm giving you my son Kim Jong\n\n1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:26.480\n Il. His body dies, but his spirit is with us forever. Who can know how many here I have,\n\n1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:31.480\n what I think. And when we suffer, we go to paradise with him. And when you block every\n\n1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:36.480\n single information going to country, of course, people are going to believe it. So who would\n\n1:05:36.480 --> 1:05:45.480\n be the successor if he dies? He has a son, first son born 2009 and not not old enough\n\n1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:51.480\n if he dies now. So either his sister might rule for a short amount of time as not like\n\n1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:58.480\n a leader, but like we like temporary placement. And then when the son is older enough, he\n\n1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:02.480\n might take it off because it's a kingdom. That's most likely and China will do everything\n\n1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:10.480\n they can to maintain that status quo for the North Korean regime. So North Korean people\n\n1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:17.480\n have no option here. We just need some leader to courageously come up and do the right thing.\n\n1:06:17.480 --> 1:06:22.480\n So we can't just wait this out. No, we can't. It's not something that takes its course\n\n1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:27.480\n and then change. Like we not even know that economic freedom does not bring political\n\n1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:33.480\n freedom. We know in China, it doesn't. That's the unique thing about freedom. You got to\n\n1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:38.480\n fight for it. Otherwise, you don't ever get it. Freedom is something that has to be fought.\n\n1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:43.480\n And if nobody fighting for freedom, it's not going to be there.\n\n1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:49.480\n Can we talk a little bit about freedom? What does it mean to you? Having had, we talked\n\n1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:57.480\n about love in that same way about freedom, having sort of discovered it later in life.\n\n1:06:57.480 --> 1:06:59.480\n What does it mean to you?\n\n1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:07.480\n I think every day I get a new definition of freedom. It is a never ending journey, having\n\n1:07:07.480 --> 1:07:17.480\n this relationship with being free and what it means to be free, right? I think you definitely\n\n1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:22.480\n can live life without being free and also happy life too. I saw a lot of North Korean\n\n1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:28.480\n elites who are fat and have power, but didn't have freedom, were very happy. In a way, happier\n\n1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:33.480\n than the people that I found in New York were like investment bankers and consultants in\n\n1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:41.480\n Manhattan and 70% of them go like talk therapist. I was very confused. I remember writing my\n\n1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:47.480\n book in New York. My editor was saying, Yami, you know you're traumatized. You need to go\n\n1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:54.480\n talk to a therapist. I was like, what is therapy? What is trauma? Because in North Korea, they\n\n1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:59.480\n don't have word for stress or trauma because how can you be stressed in a socialist paradise?\n\n1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:05.480\n They don't let you be knowing what that is. Then they were like, yeah, hearing people\n\n1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:12.480\n having problems, go talk to therapist. I was like, how much is it? $200 per hour and it's\n\n1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:23.480\n a discounted rate too. I was like, no, thank you. We know that freedom comes with responsibility\n\n1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:32.480\n and in a way, it's not that easy to be free, thinking for yourself constantly. In a way,\n\n1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:37.480\n I understand. Let's give government every power we have. Let them decide what education\n\n1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:42.480\n that I get. Let them decide where I live. Let someone figure that out for me. That's\n\n1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:48.480\n how North Korea began, hoping the government is going to represent my own interests, believing\n\n1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:56.480\n that they were good. With that benefit of doubt and good faith, it began the nightmare.\n\n1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:01.480\n Freedom is not like a gateway to be happy at all. In a way, it can make life a lot more\n\n1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:07.480\n complex, but then it's fun, isn't it? You start thinking for yourself. You start making\n\n1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:13.480\n mistakes. It's so fun to be free, even though you can be suffering way more than the people\n\n1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:14.480\n who are not free.\n\n1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:19.480\n The thing about freedom is when you have freedom, you also have the responsibility for your\n\n1:09:19.480 --> 1:09:28.480\n actions. That could be a huge burden because if you succeed, it's you, but if you fail,\n\n1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:34.480\n it's you. If you do horrible things, it's you. If you don't do something, for example,\n\n1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:41.480\n if you don't help people in North Korea, it's you. That's a huge burden. Living with that\n\n1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:46.480\n burden is a kind of suffering. There's some aspect in which freedom is suffering.\n\n1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:47.480\n It is suffering.\n\n1:09:47.480 --> 1:09:54.480\n Because life is suffering, and then freedom is you as an individual fully living through\n\n1:09:54.480 --> 1:10:01.480\n that. See, you talked, you're friends with Michael Malice. He believes, and so I want\n\n1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:07.480\n to kind of ask you about government. He believes, he's an anarchist, and he believes kind of\n\n1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:19.480\n in freedom fully implemented in human societies, meaning that humans should all be free to\n\n1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:25.480\n choose how they, you know, transact with each other, how they live together. There shouldn't\n\n1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:31.480\n be a centralized force that tells you what to do. Do you think there's some role for\n\n1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.480\n government in a healthy society?\n\n1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:36.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:42.480\n If we look at North Korea, there's the most horrible implementation of government, but\n\n1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:49.480\n then if we look at what the United States strives to be, at least in principle, there's\n\n1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:55.480\n an ideal of a government that represents the people and helps the people. Is there a place\n\n1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:59.480\n for that kind of ideal, or is government always going to get us into trouble?\n\n1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:05.480\n I am not, I mean, I spoke to Michael Malice. I kept asking why he's an anarchist, right?\n\n1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:11.480\n And he doesn't even believe in military, none of that thing. And I was like, I don't think\n\n1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:17.480\n I want to be in that world you're describing. That's pretty scary. I want the law enforcement.\n\n1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:26.480\n I want like, I don't, in a way that, so why equality makes no sense is that the fact that\n\n1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:31.480\n when you and I were born, we were born in a very different capability of thinking, different\n\n1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:36.480\n intelligence, different capability in our physics, right? So equality is nonsense. You\n\n1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:43.480\n can never achieve that, right? So to me, that's been, it's very scary in America.\n\n1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:45.480\n When the government tries to enforce.\n\n1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:48.480\n To make equality on everybody, that is impossible.\n\n1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:53.480\n Specifically equality of outcome. So like, so given that we all started different places,\n\n1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:58.480\n enforce, like measure in some kind of way where people stand, and if they're an equal,\n\n1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.480\n enforce equality. And that's what leads to the kind of things that you mentioned with\n\n1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:06.480\n the class system in North Korea.\n\n1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:12.480\n Yeah. So I think that's why government can be bad. They can be very dumb. And another\n\n1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:17.480\n thing is that they cannot know what you want. A lot of times people don't even know what\n\n1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:22.480\n they want as an individual. Like how the heck do you assume government is going to know\n\n1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:28.480\n what is best for you? Nobody knows. We just all do our best. I do think though some governments\n\n1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:34.480\n like in Switzerland, you know, have more power, give power to the different state can be good.\n\n1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.480\n I think I'm more, you know, like giving power to the state and let individual decide where\n\n1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:45.480\n they want to go in within states. Like, I mean, why did you choose Texas, right? There's\n\n1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:50.480\n no income tax, right? Like there's a lot of things people find Texas, like, you know,\n\n1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:56.480\n charming and they come here. So in a way that I don't want to be in a one strong government\n\n1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:01.480\n that makes every single thing the same way. In a way, I want to kind of experiment to\n\n1:13:01.480 --> 1:13:08.480\n everything. We can have anarchy state. There's no police, nothing going on. You can be whatever\n\n1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:13.480\n you want. And you can go to a state where it's like abortion is bad, blah, blah, this\n\n1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:19.480\n is bad. All this like conservative values. And let the ideas compete and let them how\n\n1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:25.480\n they're being practiced in real life. But I think it's very scary when the US government\n\n1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:32.480\n is getting bigger and bigger and then they try to make every state under one big government.\n\n1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:35.480\n And that's like when I get really alarmed.\n\n1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:40.480\n Are there things that you see in the United States in the current culture that's kind\n\n1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:47.480\n of has echoes of the same things you saw in North Korea that worry you?\n\n1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:56.480\n Absolutely. It's in America now the meritocracy doesn't matter, right? It's evil. The white\n\n1:13:56.480 --> 1:14:02.480\n man's idea of talking about if you're competent enough, they say, oh, if you're coming from\n\n1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:07.480\n rich white family, you are going to be competent. So other people don't have a chance. But look\n\n1:14:07.480 --> 1:14:13.480\n at Asians who came from nothing as competent and go to Harvard Law School and medical school.\n\n1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:19.480\n So it doesn't almost is like there's no incentive for you to work hard anymore in the system\n\n1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:24.480\n right now. That is North Korea. There's no incentive because you are born with your class\n\n1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:29.480\n already. So no matter what you do, you can never. So the horrible thing about North Korean\n\n1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:35.480\n system is that there's nothing holding Mary up. So if you're coming from other cultures\n\n1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:40.480\n that like Meghan Markle joined the royal family and she became a lawyer, you go up by North\n\n1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:45.480\n Korea. If someone from high class going to marry somebody down, you only go down with\n\n1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:48.480\n them. That's how they prevent class mix.\n\n1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:54.480\n Right. That kind of enforces the separation because there's a huge disincentives to go\n\n1:14:54.480 --> 1:15:03.480\n to marry to integrate between classes. What do you do about this kind of, you know, especially\n\n1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:08.480\n universities, but in companies, I'm thinking about starting a company. So I'm looking at\n\n1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:15.480\n this very carefully. There's these ideas of diversity and meritocracy. That's a tension.\n\n1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:25.480\n So I think there's a big way in which diversity broadly defined is not at all in a tension\n\n1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:33.480\n with meritocracy. So having a variety of people, backgrounds, way of thinking, all those kinds\n\n1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:40.480\n of things is a huge benefit to any group. But the way diversity is often defined is\n\n1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:48.480\n by sort of very crude classes of people, whether it's by skin color or gender or some very\n\n1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:55.480\n kind of large group way. And that actually does two things in my mind. One, it drowns\n\n1:15:55.480 --> 1:16:02.480\n out real diversity or not real, but the full spectrum of diversity, which is like within\n\n1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:13.480\n class diversity of like, are you somebody who is exceptionally good at mathematics?\n\n1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:17.480\n Are you somebody who's exceptionally good at psychology? Are you good with people? Are\n\n1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:23.480\n you good with numbers? All that kind of stuff that I think spans or intersects in fascinating\n\n1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:29.480\n ways with these kinds of groups. So that's diversity. And then meritocracy is this thing\n\n1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:34.480\n that probably the reason I wanted to move to Silicon Valley and the reason I didn't\n\n1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:40.480\n is like having a fire to change the world within you. Like meritocracy is like, I want\n\n1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:45.480\n to be the best in the world at this and I will strive and work hard, not stepping on\n\n1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:54.480\n others, but like purely within yourself, be the best version of yourself. That idea is\n\n1:16:54.480 --> 1:17:03.480\n in some ways being not celebrated or demonized. It's literally meritocracy is being demonized\n\n1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:10.480\n right now in America. Working hard is a symbol of you coming from some established family.\n\n1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:17.480\n The fact that you celebrate accomplishment, hard work is a sign of your patriarchal,\n\n1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:23.480\n whatever thing they call it. And they want to abolish that. They want to like stop giving\n\n1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:28.480\n kids grades. That's what they're already doing, right? They want to stop. They want to like\n\n1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:33.480\n we should abolish like SAT in America they take to go to college, right? They won't even\n\n1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:39.480\n abolish that. Yeah, some kids have no ability to do math. So why do we have to force them\n\n1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:44.480\n to learn math? And that's what comes with humans overcome challenges. That's what makes\n\n1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:49.480\n us special. But then like, because it's kids coming from this family, let's find a reason\n\n1:17:49.480 --> 1:17:53.480\n why they cannot, and then they don't have to do that thing. But they still deserve the\n\n1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:59.480\n same job. They need to be a lawyer and doctors. And that's like what in North Korea was like\n\n1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:05.480\n not, there was not even meritocracy beginning with, right? Did you born in the same family,\n\n1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:11.480\n the family, the blood, right? Like if one person does something wrong, it's like collective\n\n1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:17.480\n guilt. Because I spoke out, three generations of my family got punished, who I left behind.\n\n1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:23.480\n And then in America, I see the same thing. Like if you're somehow great, great grandfather\n\n1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:30.480\n on the slave, now you are privileged and you're guilty because you are white and guilt. But\n\n1:18:30.480 --> 1:18:36.480\n how do you change your ancestor? How did you have a saying on it? And that is where there's\n\n1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:41.480\n no way out. There's no forgiving, there's no moving forwards. And this current culture\n\n1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:47.480\n in America now, like I remember at Columbia, like before class, everybody had to go around\n\n1:18:47.480 --> 1:18:53.480\n saying, tell us what your pronoun is. And my English, my third language, I learned as\n\n1:18:53.480 --> 1:19:00.480\n an adult. Even saying he and she, I'm confused. It's a pure mistake. And they say, call me\n\n1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:04.480\n they, because I'm gender fluid. Basically, I can be a girl, but next hour you talk to\n\n1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:10.480\n me, I'm a boy, right? And if you don't do it right, they like look at you, why are you\n\n1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:16.480\n doing it? Right? It makes me so nervous. And this is where I come to, this is a regression\n\n1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:23.480\n of civilization. We are regressing as a humanity here. Like the enlightenment, all of those\n\n1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:28.480\n things made us so much brighter and looking forward. And now we are going backwards.\n\n1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:33.480\n Well, I think there's a pendulum aspect to it because it's my hope in terms of backwards.\n\n1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:38.480\n So pendulum goes backwards too, but it just goes back and forth, I think. And then in\n\n1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:44.480\n the long arc of history, we're making progress. I think all of the discussions of diversity\n\n1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:51.480\n and inclusion and all those kinds of things, I always thought that they're healthy in moderation.\n\n1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:57.480\n They should be a small part of the conversation amongst other things. The natural aspect,\n\n1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:03.480\n it seems that they kind of have this way of just consuming all conversations. It's like\n\n1:20:03.480 --> 1:20:08.480\n the meetings, like diversity and inclusion meetings multiply somehow, where it's like\n\n1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:12.480\n the only thing that you're talking about. And it's very kind of absurd. And when I look\n\n1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:20.480\n at, even at MIT, it's a strangely disproportionate amount of discussions about that. And also\n\n1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:25.480\n to me as an engineer, those discussions are very frustrating because they don't seem to\n\n1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:36.480\n actually do anything. So they want to bully people instead of creating systems that fix\n\n1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:42.480\n definitive problems. And that in itself, that kind of bullying, that's the same kind of\n\n1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:47.480\n thing you saw in terms of McCarthyism in America against the communists. You certainly saw\n\n1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:55.480\n that in Soviet Union against everybody who's not communist. It creates hate, not progress.\n\n1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:59.480\n When you talked to Jordan Peterson recently, and people should listen to that conversation,\n\n1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:10.480\n it was a fascinating one. I think he almost got emotional on the discussion about universities\n\n1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:16.480\n and your experience with Columbia because he, like myself, for perhaps different reasons,\n\n1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:21.480\n have a hope for our academic institutions. Some of the most incredible people, some of\n\n1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:27.480\n the most incredible engineering and idea development, innovation happens in universities. And so\n\n1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:35.480\n we both deeply care about them. Is there something, so the reason he got emotional, the reason\n\n1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:44.480\n he was kind of hurt is the fact that you did not, you were not deeply inspired by your\n\n1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:46.480\n experience at Columbia.\n\n1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:54.480\n It made me dumber. It made me scared. It made me terrified that I had to censor myself in\n\n1:21:54.480 --> 1:22:01.480\n America. Are you seriously telling me that you don't ever censor yourself? Can you truly\n\n1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:09.480\n say whatever you want about race, about anything, gender? We all censor ourselves. Let's be\n\n1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:15.480\n honest, right? We are all doing that. And that's what I learned. I thought I was coming\n\n1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:20.480\n to a country where never needed, like first thing my mom taught me growing up in North\n\n1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:27.480\n Korea was, don't even whisper because the birds and mice could hear you. And I thought,\n\n1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:32.480\n okay, now America is truly the land of the free, home of the brave. You can say anything\n\n1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:38.480\n you want, and then you have freedom to change your mind and evolve. But the people now demand\n\n1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:43.480\n you to be the perfect version they demand you to be. You cannot change your mind. And\n\n1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:49.480\n then what is the meaning of life if you cannot grow? You should feel safe to talk about anything,\n\n1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:53.480\n and then later, okay, I was wrong. But now if you do that, you got to get penalized\n\n1:22:53.480 --> 1:22:54.480\n for it.\n\n1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:59.480\n I mean, censorship is a funny thing because you probably should not say dumb things. You\n\n1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:04.480\n should try to say things you want to say in the most eloquent, the most effective way\n\n1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:10.480\n you can. So, I mean, that's what editing is, right? So there's some level of like being\n\n1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:17.480\n careful with what you say, not because you're afraid of some overarching kind of group of\n\n1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:22.480\n bullies, but you want to be the best version of yourself when you express stuff. But there's\n\n1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:27.480\n some sense where in the university setting, you can put that self censorship like level\n\n1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:33.480\n down more and say stupid stuff and explain and play because you should be forgiven for\n\n1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:39.480\n that kind of play, especially when you're discussing difficult aspects of human history,\n\n1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:46.480\n whether that include racism, that include atrocities. I'm still nevertheless sort of\n\n1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:53.480\n hopeful, but at the same time, I'm surrounded by engineers. So I don't get to interact with\n\n1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:57.480\n people in humanities much. And it seems like there's getting worse.\n\n1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:59.480\n It's a good thing. It's a good thing.\n\n1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:07.480\n Yeah, I don't know. Well, I do sort of interact with psychologists, but they haven't touched\n\n1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:14.480\n on those kinds of topics yet. I still, sort of in defense of psychology, I still, I wish\n\n1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:15.480\n I had more numbers.\n\n1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:16.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:22.480\n But I still feel like most psychology people don't partake in this kind of stuff either.\n\n1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:26.480\n They're just doing excellent research. We're just highlighting, this is what America does\n\n1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:35.480\n well. You're kind of highlighting anecdotal experiences and making a big deal out of them.\n\n1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:40.480\n But that's good because like it's a slippery slope. If those things start to overtake all\n\n1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:44.480\n of academia, it starts becoming a big problem, even in the engineering field. So we should\n\n1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:49.480\n be concerned. But it is truly tragic that somebody who's exceptionally well read like\n\n1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:56.480\n you, whose fire was stoked first with Orwell, that fire should burn bright. Like this should\n\n1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:03.480\n not be, you should be writing many books. You know what I mean? Like, and you'll be,\n\n1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:08.480\n you talk to Jordan, you know, it's very possible depending what you want to do with your life\n\n1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:14.480\n that you'll be a future Jordan Peterson, right? So like that, and Columbia should be a place\n\n1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:21.480\n that enriches your mind. And the fact that it didn't is tragic.\n\n1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:26.480\n I mean, I did the same. It's like I was there four years. It wasn't like I had a one class\n\n1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:31.480\n that was bad in a one semester. That was the thing. When Dr. Piro was asking, is there\n\n1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:38.480\n any one class that had no sentiment of this virtue, signoring, politically right? There\n\n1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:48.480\n was none. Entire course, I think I took 126 credits total. Not even one class. Doesn't\n\n1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:52.480\n matter we were talking about classic art. And that's the thing. I literally thought,\n\n1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:57.480\n okay, I pushed the last semester to call like the art and music, right? So I thought this\n\n1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:02.480\n is going to be the least politically correct class I can take. And then it begins with\n\n1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:08.480\n who has problem with calling this course the Western civilization of art and music. And\n\n1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:12.480\n everyone's like raising their hands. Because like, why do we have to learning about this\n\n1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:18.480\n Beethoven, Mozart, the bigots, and all the people, like, you know, everything ruined\n\n1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:26.480\n by white men. And it's even music, even these paintings. And as I didn't raise my hand,\n\n1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:30.480\n everyone was looking at me. How do you not have the problem with this? Like you should\n\n1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:36.480\n hate this, you're Asian. So I think that's the thing is I think the problems are way\n\n1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:43.480\n deeper than what people think. And that's what when I learned is like, it's not that\n\n1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:50.480\n safe in America, we can go complete to the south. And looking at even Europe, that is\n\n1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:57.480\n like, I used to be way more optimistic. But now I actually see, wow, this country can\n\n1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:03.480\n go to south. And we might, if US forced them, right, this is the only country left to battle\n\n1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:08.480\n with the Communist Party in China. We may lose the opportunity to be free ever again\n\n1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:10.480\n as a humanity.\n\n1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:15.480\n Wow. So I mean, that puts a lot of value on having these kinds of conversations. It\n\n1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:20.480\n is, I mean, I'm troubled. I'm troubled by a lot of things. But like censorship on YouTube,\n\n1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:26.480\n for example. Yeah, it was very annoying to have to listen to Donald Trump all the time.\n\n1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:31.480\n Just like create drama, like news cycle was completely drowned out by Donald Trump. But\n\n1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:42.480\n like banning him from Twitter, it was like, that was scary for me, because it's like,\n\n1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:48.480\n that's a step towards a direction where you're going to, like, where does that take us? You're\n\n1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:53.480\n going to silence people, then it's like Jordan Peterson is next.\n\n1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:58.480\n That's why we need to promote freedom of thinking and speech, right? And the one thing that\n\n1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:08.480\n I love about Dr. Peterson is, he's a psychologist, right? He talks about we think by talking.\n\n1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:12.480\n That's why when you go to therapy, you talk and then you hear yourself and then you think\n\n1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:19.480\n and you come up to the answer. It's so important for humans to talk so we can think. So when\n\n1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:24.480\n they say you cannot talk means you cannot think. And they don't know the consequences\n\n1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:31.480\n of that. And this is why I promote, I want the freedom of speech, even though it hurts,\n\n1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:37.480\n ridiculous, you know, sometimes it can be dangerous. But the price, the alternative\n\n1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:42.480\n is so bad that we should take the, you know, make this trade off. Everything has a trade\n\n1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:48.480\n off in this world. And it comes with a sacrifice, right? So I think that's what I want to say.\n\n1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:53.480\n That's what I want to see in America. But it's unfortunately like the people like you\n\n1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:59.480\n say, who decides what is hate speech? What is dangerous? That's what I've been getting\n\n1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:05.480\n scared. Because everybody's imperfect. How do we want to give that power to them? And\n\n1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:09.480\n they're going to decide, today they might agree with me, say, okay, your speech is good,\n\n1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:14.480\n promotes good, and then they might come back next year and say your speech is bad. What\n\n1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:19.480\n are you going to do when that happens to you? We have to almost like get ideas out and then\n\n1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:23.480\n play with them. I think what's a really important component of that is forgiving each other\n\n1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:31.480\n for like realizing that we're a different person day by day and certainly years later.\n\n1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:36.480\n And I think some of that is both cultural mechanisms of saying like we forgive each\n\n1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:42.480\n other for wrong ideas or not wrong ideas, but for who we are, the full evolution of\n\n1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:48.480\n the human being, for the steps we've taken on that evolution, and also creating mechanisms\n\n1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:56.480\n that allow you to allow us to forgive each other. Like, for example, on Twitter is like\n\n1:29:56.480 --> 1:30:02.480\n horrible with this because one of the main viral ways that people create drama on Twitter\n\n1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:08.480\n is like pulling up an old tweet that somebody said, right? And then saying, oh, this is\n\n1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:14.480\n the guy that thinks that. But that's like the opposite of the mechanisms we need to\n\n1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:20.480\n forgive ourselves, forgive each other for the things we've said in the past. And so\n\n1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:28.480\n part of that is the cultural, part of this is the technological mechanisms. You mentioned\n\n1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:34.480\n Jordan Peterson. You had a great conversation with him. What was chatting with him like?\n\n1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:40.480\n I'm just curious because he's deeply passionate, especially on the Soviet Union side about\n\n1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:46.480\n the atrocities of these kinds of systems. What was it like? What did you agree with\n\n1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:52.480\n him on? What did you disagree? What were some things you both kind of learned from each\n\n1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:57.480\n other through that conversation, do you think? So here, so my story, the Jordan\n\n1:30:57.480 --> 1:31:04.480\n Peterson, a very long one. So one day I was walking down in Chicago, and they were like\n\n1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:11.480\n huge theater was sold out. It says a big letter, Jordan Peterson sold out. And then it was\n\n1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:15.480\n a huge theater in the middle of Chicago, right? Like, this is my comedian, like who can be\n\n1:31:15.480 --> 1:31:22.480\n selling this entire thing out at like 7pm? And then with my ex husband, we were walking\n\n1:31:22.480 --> 1:31:28.480\n the street. And then we saw people were like selling this like tickets, like for a very\n\n1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:33.480\n higher price, right? And then do you want to take it? And then he was like, yeah, sure.\n\n1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:42.480\n We went in, it's packed. And then I was just happy birth or like, but I wasn't able to\n\n1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:46.480\n understand his English that much. My English was still bad. And you didn't know who he\n\n1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:50.480\n was really? No, no. You were just curious? Yeah, it was like 2018. Who's the guy that\n\n1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:56.480\n sells out a thing? A theater? Yeah. Yes, I saw Dave Rubin came out before him and make\n\n1:31:56.480 --> 1:32:00.480\n jokes. I still don't know who Dave Rubin is. Afterwards, I met them all. But back then\n\n1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:05.480\n I had no clue what that is. And then he was giving lessons. But what I got from that night\n\n1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:12.480\n was not what Jordan said, but what people did on the audience. These people like I don't\n\n1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:20.480\n know, thousands of people in this big theater, crying like babies. And that was like, whatever\n\n1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.480\n that guy is doing is very special, right? He wasn't like making any jokes. He had no\n\n1:32:25.480 --> 1:32:31.480\n slides, just a one simple person standing in the huge, giant theater talk. And long\n\n1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:38.480\n time too. And people cry as like, wow, okay, whatever that is, I gotta check it out. And\n\n1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:43.480\n then I got home. And then later, many years later, I got a book. And I will start reading\n\n1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:49.480\n his book. And it talks about, it explains so much, right? Like now at Columbia, I learned\n\n1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:55.480\n like everything gender is like made up concept, construct, like the hierarchy is my man's\n\n1:32:55.480 --> 1:33:00.480\n idea of making the hierarchy. And then he begins with the number one, the laughsers\n\n1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:06.480\n had the hierarchies, evolution of history that is within us, that we want a hierarchy,\n\n1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:12.480\n right? And then chapter five about socialization of child, you know, how do you raise them?\n\n1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:19.480\n And all of it, and then what's why telling the truth is matters, right? And there's a\n\n1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:25.480\n white, like in his entire 12 lessons, I read it and it's like, I was so grateful that I'm\n\n1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:30.480\n alive with this. There's people always say, if Socrates is alive, how much would you pay\n\n1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:36.480\n to have lunch with him? That kind of thing, right? So for me it was like, okay, I'm like\n\n1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:42.480\n alive in the same contemporary world as one of the greatest thinkers of my entire generation.\n\n1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:53.480\n And then like, how much money would I pay? No limit amount. And I like reached out to\n\n1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:57.480\n Michaela on her podcast on Twitter and connected. And then one day she said, do you want to\n\n1:33:57.480 --> 1:34:05.480\n be on Michaela's podcast? I was like, what? I was like, of course. And I was very nervous,\n\n1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:13.480\n but I didn't expect him to be like that connected. Cause I thought he was a psychologist, like\n\n1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:18.480\n he saw so much suffering in the world. He studied Soviet Union, his hobbies collecting\n\n1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:24.480\n those things to remind him of the suffering of a human being. So sometimes some people\n\n1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:29.480\n hear so much atrocity, they become like very, you know, not engaged.\n\n1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:30.480\n Yeah, desensitized.\n\n1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:31.480\n Desensitized.\n\n1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:35.480\n He felt, he was feeling, he was, it's almost like he was living through the experiences\n\n1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:39.480\n with you as you were talking about it. It was an amazing conversation. So Jordan is\n\n1:34:39.480 --> 1:34:43.480\n one of the great thinkers of our time, but I would say the greatest thinkers of our time\n\n1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:49.480\n is Michael Malus. So you've also got a chance to talk to him. So he wrote a book on North\n\n1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:55.480\n Korea. It's an interesting style book. I learned a lot from it. I learned a lot from Michael\n\n1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:02.480\n about it. And it's interesting that he chose North Korea as a thing to study. That he,\n\n1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:10.480\n of all people, this fascinating human being that is Michael, chose this darkest of aspects\n\n1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:17.480\n of humanity to study. What do you think of Michael? What do you think of his book on\n\n1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:20.480\n North Korea called Dear Reader that people should definitely check out?\n\n1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:25.480\n Absolutely. So back then, when I reached out to Michael through mutual friends in South\n\n1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:33.480\n Korea, my English wasn't good. So I got a copy in my hand. I tried to read and a lot\n\n1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:40.480\n of them I didn't understand. So, but I thought it was very fascinating how he explained North\n\n1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:45.480\n Korea through the Dear Leader's perspective, right? Nobody has ever done that. And you\n\n1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:52.480\n can reveal so much about the state and absurdity of the entire situation. And also through\n\n1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:59.480\n humor. And that's what's amazing about Michael. He knows the full gravity of tragedy. He knows\n\n1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:04.480\n the full suffering. He's not just like people here in America on the BuzzFeed making fun\n\n1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:09.480\n of Kim Jong Un's haircut. They don't care what people go through. Michael cares.\n\n1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:16.480\n Deeply cares. And then he still does ridiculous jokes. So that kind of reveals in a dark way\n\n1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:22.480\n the absurdity of evil. And he does that masterfully. Do you?\n\n1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:25.480\n He's a genius. He is definitely a genius.\n\n1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:34.480\n All right. If he watches this, let's not make his head too big here. But is there some\n\n1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:43.480\n aspect to, I mean, there is an absurdity to the whole thing. Kim Jong Un is this, I mean,\n\n1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:45.480\n he's almost like a caricature of evil.\n\n1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:46.480\n It's a joke.\n\n1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:47.480\n It's a joke.\n\n1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:52.480\n A lot of people think it's a joke. They just think like, this is too, too absurd. They\n\n1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:58.480\n just, they laugh. Like, can you imagine you laugh at Holocaust? This is that ridiculous.\n\n1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:04.480\n Can you maybe psychoanalyze that a little bit? Because that's where my mind goes to.\n\n1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:14.480\n Like, he's so ridiculous that you can't, it's almost like hard to believe this is real.\n\n1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:23.480\n Is that just, is that just my kind of and people's desire to escape the cruelty of reality\n\n1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.480\n by just kind of making a joke out of it?\n\n1:37:25.480 --> 1:37:34.480\n I think it is a few things, right? Like, so North Korea as a nation, number one or number\n\n1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:41.480\n two smartest IQ people in the world, despite their malnutrition. So...\n\n1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:48.480\n So there is, I mean, that's an interesting point. So in your sense, the people...\n\n1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:49.480\n Are not dumb.\n\n1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:57.480\n Still carry the sort of the brilliance. There's a culture there that's like hungry to become\n\n1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:04.480\n realized. Like the people that are silenced by the electricity, by the actually having\n\n1:38:04.480 --> 1:38:08.480\n no food, all those kinds of things. Like, if you add the electricity, if you add the\n\n1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:11.480\n food, you're going to have a cultural center of the world.\n\n1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:16.480\n Like South Korea. That's what they exactly did, right? The exact same Korea. One became\n\n1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:23.480\n like 11th largest economy. One became the world's most like poorest nation, right? And\n\n1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:28.480\n this is a perfect example. Like if, I don't know if you read that book, Why Nation Fails.\n\n1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:34.480\n The system. It's not about a culture. It is not about people. It is not about IQ. What\n\n1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:40.480\n makes us too different is a system. South Korea, North Korea is a perfect example of\n\n1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:46.480\n that. One is exact same capability. We are a homogeneous country, same language, tradition,\n\n1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:52.480\n all of that. We gave them different system. One is free democracy, one is dictatorship\n\n1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:59.480\n and came up with the biggest different result. And I think North Korea reveals that to us.\n\n1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:05.480\n It's not because we are great that we are living in this prosperity. Free market. The\n\n1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:12.480\n ideas gave us to this. The system we built, our ancestors built, gave us this privilege.\n\n1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:18.480\n It's not us. Nothing is about us being special here, right? The system that we have is quite\n\n1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:25.480\n special. And North Korea proves that to us. It doesn't matter even if you're smart. That's\n\n1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:32.480\n all irrelevant. And I think that's why people just keep denying that they want to feel special.\n\n1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:38.480\n Because I'm awesome, I got all of this. No, it's not you, you got this. And when people\n\n1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:44.480\n say, I hate capitalism. I was like, without capitalism, how do you came up with this thing?\n\n1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:47.480\n Literally, how did you come up with this?\n\n1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:57.480\n The systems matter. And they matter way more than this individualistic society would like\n\n1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:08.480\n to imagine. It is the most important thing you can have in life. Choosing the right system.\n\n1:40:08.480 --> 1:40:14.480\n Do you have advice for young people today? You've lived an incredible life and you have,\n\n1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:20.480\n I hope, an incredible life ahead of you. What advice would you give to young people today,\n\n1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:28.480\n high schoolers, college students, how to be successful in their career or maybe successful\n\n1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:30.480\n in life?\n\n1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:39.480\n Last thing I want them to feel is guilty. It doesn't do anything, right? So I hate when\n\n1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:44.480\n people talk about, oh, why guilt? It's like, that doesn't make even any sense, right? I\n\n1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:51.480\n think the fact that they are born with freedom is a blessing for all of us. It's not like\n\n1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:56.480\n I want them to want to do something because they are guilty. I want them to do something\n\n1:40:56.480 --> 1:41:02.480\n because they are grateful. It is true. Like we are sitting here, the fact why I have children\n\n1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:09.480\n is suffering, having kids you don't sleep, costly, like so much work. Like any like logical\n\n1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:15.480\n rational mind, you should never want children, right? Why would you do that to yourself?\n\n1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:21.480\n Especially as a woman, right? You don't want to do that to yourself. But think about like\n\n1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:26.480\n we are sitting here today, two of us in this amazing technology, this country, because\n\n1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:31.480\n somebody in Savannah hundreds of thousands of years ago, they're hunting berries and\n\n1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:38.480\n surviving cold. Every suffering they can imagine, they fall for us. That's why we ended up here.\n\n1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:45.480\n So life is ultimately bigger than us. And I think that's what I want them. It's not\n\n1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:50.480\n like I want them to do the right thing and be the best version of themselves. It's like,\n\n1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:55.480\n I want them to feel grateful. And we should be grateful for the freedom and then take\n\n1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:00.480\n full advantage of that. I mean, it starts with the freedom to experience everything\n\n1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:08.480\n in life. And for your life, literally, like how my father, like, you know, working, dying\n\n1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:16.480\n is a lot easier than living. Dying takes like few minutes, right? Maximum. And living takes\n\n1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:22.480\n forever. So when I was facing this unbelievable challenge, I thought, okay, this most rational\n\n1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:27.480\n thing I can do is killing myself right now. But the hardest thing I can choose is choose\n\n1:42:27.480 --> 1:42:33.480\n to live. And my father did that. Even in the concentration camp, even no matter why he\n\n1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:40.480\n said, life is a gift. You need to fight for it. And I think that's what's missing here,\n\n1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:46.480\n that we don't think life as a gift. It's a gift. Like, how many people had to fight\n\n1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:52.480\n for me to be here today? Think about the sacrifice they made for many, many, many generations.\n\n1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:56.480\n I don't even know what they went through. I can't even fathom what they went through.\n\n1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:02.480\n They fought for life. Yeah. And that is my responsibility enough. So it doesn't make\n\n1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:08.480\n them, their fight was not meaningless, right? It meant something because now I'm carrying\n\n1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:18.480\n on that fight. You mentioned considering suicide. Do you think about your mortality now? Now\n\n1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:27.480\n that you're perhaps in a slightly more comfortable place, do you still think about death? I do\n\n1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:35.480\n because I was informed actually when I was 21 that I was on the killing list of Kim Jong\n\n1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:43.480\n Un by South Korean intelligence. And then I had to live with that, right? But now I\n\n1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:48.480\n actually feel more because, I don't know, you follow Jamal Khashoggi's story, the Saudi\n\n1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:54.480\n journalist who got chopped off in Turkey embassy, right? His reason why he got killed was he\n\n1:43:54.480 --> 1:44:01.480\n became very prominent on Twitter. He had a huge voice and Saudis followed him. Now I\n\n1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:07.480\n became very first North Korean to have this many social media followings. And recently\n\n1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:13.480\n North Korea started an investigation team to analyze whatever I do, even though it's\n\n1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:18.480\n first time for them. So they don't even know what to do at this point. They're like, this\n\n1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:24.480\n is so new. What do we do? We do Kim Jong Nam. Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of Kim\n\n1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:30.480\n Jong Un got killed in Malaysia. That is another tragedy that I feel so sorry for the US government\n\n1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:36.480\n is that Kim Jong Nam was giving information to the CIA for the past like 10 years. That\n\n1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:41.480\n trip, when he got killed in Malaysian airport, he was meeting up with the CIA agent for two\n\n1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:49.480\n days on the Northern Ireland. CIA could have protected him. They didn't. They let him die.\n\n1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:50.480\n Who killed him?\n\n1:44:50.480 --> 1:44:55.480\n North Korean Kim Jong Un killed him. Do you know the Malaysian, the ladies, the VX, the\n\n1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:02.480\n nerve agent. North Koreans killed him in Malaysian airport, in the international land. So I mean\n\n1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:07.480\n North Korea, who was a US resident and the Washington Post journalist, when he got killed\n\n1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:13.480\n in Saudi like a lamb, they chopped him into pieces. In that most inhumane death, what\n\n1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:20.480\n was the consequences for the Saudis? Nothing. The word is we think we live in a country\n\n1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:26.480\n where there's no justice. There is no accountability for killing any dissent, no matter how big\n\n1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:27.480\n their names are.\n\n1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:34.480\n So you don't think your vast and quickly growing social media presence protects you?\n\n1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:39.480\n No, it does the opposite. Because Kim Jong Un, initially when I spoke out, I don't know\n\n1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:44.480\n if you went through it, they did everything they could to character assassinate me, saying\n\n1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:50.480\n I'm a liar, I'm a CIA spy, I get paid. And then they reached out to Penguin saying,\n\n1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:54.480\n we're going to blow up. You cannot write this book. And they did it with Sony. They\n\n1:45:54.480 --> 1:46:00.480\n had a Sony studio for making that stupid movie interview. And then Penguin did their\n\n1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:05.480\n investigation. They met every survivor that I went through in the desert. They got the\n\n1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:09.480\n voice recordings of them because they don't want them to change their mind later. People\n\n1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:14.480\n remember differently. So they got the voice recordings, the Penguin Regal team got all\n\n1:46:14.480 --> 1:46:18.480\n the audios, and now we are ready for the lawsuit. We are going to publish this book because\n\n1:46:18.480 --> 1:46:23.480\n we checked, verified every single thing that was going in the book. And North Korea couldn't\n\n1:46:23.480 --> 1:46:24.480\n do anything anymore.\n\n1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:29.480\n But that's character assassination. Which by the way, that's a whole other conversation\n\n1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:33.480\n that you were able to survive that. I appreciate the kind of strength it requires to survive\n\n1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:39.480\n that because you don't know. And your character being assassinated is in some ways can be\n\n1:46:39.480 --> 1:46:42.480\n as painful as actual assassination.\n\n1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:48.480\n It's worse. It's worse. Everybody think you're a liar. Everybody think you're a liar. And\n\n1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:53.480\n now everybody, like you said, this nature of internet is that as long as something is\n\n1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:57.480\n written in the internet, they think that's a fact. Any stupid person can start a blog\n\n1:46:57.480 --> 1:47:02.480\n and write about you. But they think, oh, because it's written on the internet, it's legit.\n\n1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:07.480\n Especially negative stuff. That's the thing I was kind of trying to elaborate on. There's\n\n1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:13.480\n a viral aspect to calling somebody a fraud or a liar that nobody questions whether it's\n\n1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:21.480\n true or not. It just spreads. And it's a dark side of our human nature that we want to destroy\n\n1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:23.480\n the people who are rising.\n\n1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:29.480\n We cannot stand it. Any change maker in this world who wasn't controversial, right? Martin\n\n1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:37.480\n Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, he was called as a terrorist. So I just did not know.\n\n1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:41.480\n The character assassination is the thing. It'll probably continue with you.\n\n1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.480\n It will continue with me forever.\n\n1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:48.480\n So you have to get stronger and stronger, I think, in the face of that. But actual assassination,\n\n1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:54.480\n perhaps it's me being hopeful because I have a situation with Russia that I hope I'm not\n\n1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:00.480\n under. Well, I don't care actually. But there's some aspect in which social media presence,\n\n1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:08.480\n I thought, protects you a little bit. Because just imagine the outrage from an attempted\n\n1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:10.480\n assassination of you.\n\n1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:14.480\n But what was the outrage when Jamal Khashoggi got killed like that?\n\n1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:17.480\n Was the social media presence large?\n\n1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:23.480\n Over one million people. I don't have that following. He was 1.6 million Twitter followers.\n\n1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:25.480\n And the outrage wasn't there?\n\n1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:31.480\n No. Because Saudis spoke to Amazon, to Prime Studio, Netflix. There were people who made\n\n1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:37.480\n a documentary about him but told everybody cannot get that deal. So there was a huge\n\n1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:42.480\n censorship on that. And people, of course, I mean, they can talk about it one day. Some\n\n1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:45.480\n dissent from Saudi got killed. Horrible.\n\n1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:47.480\n But it just dissipates.\n\n1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:51.480\n They move on to the next cute puppy, right? The next cute cat. That's what the nature\n\n1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:57.480\n of this new generation does. They desensitize. It doesn't affect them. They keep following\n\n1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:02.480\n the instant pleasure, instant high. That's what Instagram does to you. It changes your\n\n1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:07.480\n brain. That's what I was reading. We spoke about shallows. We became shallow and shallow\n\n1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:12.480\n and our brain changed permanently. So this new generation, we can get them angry for\n\n1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:18.480\n like 10 minutes, create hashtags for one day. But then as quick as that was, it goes down\n\n1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:22.480\n like instantly. And I think that's the...\n\n1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:27.480\n Well, that means that... Okay. So that means that there is... It's an effective way to\n\n1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:33.480\n get rid of opposition is by murdering them. And that means United States, if it stands\n\n1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:38.480\n for freedom, if it stands for the freedom of exchange of ideas, should be protecting\n\n1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:39.480\n people like you.\n\n1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:45.480\n But they don't because they don't want to be involved. They didn't even protect Kim\n\n1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:50.480\n Jong Nam who was giving information 10 years risking his life. That's what is so... I\n\n1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:58.480\n mean, working for CIA is not bad. The thing is that he was giving information to bring\n\n1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:04.480\n down the regime. That is valuable. That is something noble about him. But then you just\n\n1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:09.480\n don't go extra miles to that. That's when I lost my faith in the US system as well.\n\n1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:15.480\n Like this country just cares about saving face. What is most the minimum cost they pay\n\n1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:21.480\n for anything? And when I was in South Korea, constantly, every single day intelligence\n\n1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:26.480\n calling me. The North Korean agent going this place, where are you going? The US system\n\n1:50:26.480 --> 1:50:32.480\n came to US, nobody. That's when people said, are you a CIA agent? I wish they called me.\n\n1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:38.480\n I wish they called me. I really truly do. But nobody, nobody does here. I'm sure they\n\n1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:43.480\n know what's going on. But the South Korean agent is more like, oh my gosh, we don't want\n\n1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:47.480\n you to get killed as a South Korean citizen, right? Yeah. And now I'm trying to become\n\n1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:54.480\n your citizen. So it's in a way, it's, I don't know what's worse. Are you afraid for your\n\n1:50:54.480 --> 1:51:03.480\n life? I was afraid. For the several, three, four years, I was afraid. But I had to come\n\n1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:09.480\n to terms with it. Like my enemy is not some crazy psychopath. It's a state with nuclear\n\n1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:15.480\n power to attack the most powerful country. If Kim Jong Un decides if I die, I'm going\n\n1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:22.480\n to die. It's not up to me, right? So in a way, also it's liberating that you, it's like\n\n1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:27.480\n if you are like afraid of some mobs or some like gangsters on the street, it's almost\n\n1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:32.480\n like you have power over a little bit. You got to be like thinking that's my fault. I\n\n1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:37.480\n went that way, right? But when it comes to Kim Jong Un, I know like my enemy is so much\n\n1:51:37.480 --> 1:51:44.480\n bigger than me. It's in a ways of liberation. And also, you know, I just, I live a lot.\n\n1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:49.480\n So I have seen a lot. I seen everything. I don't have that much regret left here. Like,\n\n1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:54.480\n okay, I'm going too soon. You know, it's like, okay, maybe it's time. Like death is a part\n\n1:51:54.480 --> 1:52:02.480\n of life. So. In some sense, you're willing to accept death to keep fighting for freedom\n\n1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:09.480\n in your, in at least in part a place you call home. Yeah, it is. Do you hope that one day\n\n1:52:09.480 --> 1:52:15.480\n you can return to North Korea? I hope so. I hope I bring my son and tell him this is\n\n1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:21.980\n like where your ancestors from too. It would look very different than the place you came\n\n1:52:21.980 --> 1:52:32.480\n from in your, as you hope. Do you hope that there's a democracy one day that North Korea\n\n1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:42.980\n looks like South Korea? Well, that would be in paradise, right? But I'm a rational optimist.\n\n1:52:42.980 --> 1:52:48.880\n I'm not like just optimistic because I have to be. I think as long as there are people\n\n1:52:48.880 --> 1:52:54.980\n who have changed the world, right? Like who believed in something and worked for it. And\n\n1:52:54.980 --> 1:52:59.280\n like, I don't know, like there's like Alice Shroves, a few people holding entire this\n\n1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:06.080\n world, right? I really believe in that. I think as long as that continues, that can\n\n1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:11.280\n happen in my country. As long as people like you someday want to decide to do something\n\n1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:15.680\n with North Korea and working for it, using your brainpower to solve this puzzle, how\n\n1:53:15.680 --> 1:53:21.680\n fascinating would that be? That's why I continue to speak, continue to recruit. To inspire\n\n1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:29.980\n millions to do something. The books you like are all the books I love. I have to mention\n\n1:53:29.980 --> 1:53:37.780\n this. You mentioned briefly on the, with Jordan, Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is an incredible\n\n1:53:37.780 --> 1:53:43.580\n book. I mean, I don't know exactly what I want to ask here, but there's some, I think\n\n1:53:43.580 --> 1:53:52.980\n the book kind of, through telling a story, reveals that life is suffering and yet there's\n\n1:53:52.980 --> 1:53:59.380\n beauty in it. The beauty in every moment that uses kind of a river to paint a metaphor.\n\n1:53:59.380 --> 1:54:07.080\n Is there something that you could say, speak to like how that book impacted your life and\n\n1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:11.980\n the way you live life, maybe the way you see life, whether it's on the life of suffering\n\n1:54:11.980 --> 1:54:14.580\n side or that life is beautiful side.\n\n1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:20.180\n I mean, he goes the entire journey, right? He goes in this state of, I'm so enlightened\n\n1:54:20.180 --> 1:54:25.080\n that I cannot deal with the people who are there in love and quiet about it. Right? They're\n\n1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:33.380\n like, that's so like primitive. Once he has his own son, he actually being attached. He\n\n1:54:33.380 --> 1:54:37.980\n actually cares. He actually really does whole thing, right? That's a thing that he used\n\n1:54:37.980 --> 1:54:44.180\n to think not. Once his son comes find him, he looks at life differently. I think that's\n\n1:54:44.180 --> 1:54:49.780\n the thing. I did have that kind of journey where, oh, nothing matters, right? So bitter.\n\n1:54:49.780 --> 1:54:58.580\n So so like, so cynical. And after I met so many incredible people, I was talking about\n\n1:54:58.580 --> 1:55:05.180\n that person who told me he was gay. He told me, I love you. And I was like, why do you\n\n1:55:05.180 --> 1:55:10.680\n love me? In the past, people when they wanted me was because they want to rape me. Everybody\n\n1:55:10.680 --> 1:55:15.680\n wanted something from me. That's why they wanted me. And I never understood. You can\n\n1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:20.980\n love somebody unconditionally. And this gay guy, the last one was want to sleep with me,\n\n1:55:20.980 --> 1:55:26.780\n right? And he loves me. And I think I had a blessing after my journey, meeting people\n\n1:55:26.780 --> 1:55:32.380\n who loved me unconditionally because I was just being a human. And I think that's what\n\n1:55:32.380 --> 1:55:39.580\n it is now for me that like him. I live for love now. I live for love. Any kinds of love.\n\n1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:45.180\n Love for knowledge. I like, I read so many books because I love books, right? I love\n\n1:55:45.180 --> 1:55:52.380\n what I do. I love my people. I love humanity. You know, even it sometimes annoys me. I love\n\n1:55:52.380 --> 1:55:53.380\n myself.\n\n1:55:53.380 --> 1:55:56.580\n And that's beautiful too. The annoying parts are beautiful too. What do you, let me ask\n\n1:55:56.580 --> 1:56:01.180\n the ridiculous question. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Of what's\n\n1:56:01.180 --> 1:56:02.980\n the meaning of life?\n\n1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:10.380\n Well, I think at this point I stop questioning why I'm here, right? Like it doesn't matter\n\n1:56:10.380 --> 1:56:15.180\n someone put the atom there or a big bang. I'm here. That's truth, right? I'm going to\n\n1:56:15.180 --> 1:56:19.780\n accept that fully. So what, instead of me keep asking the impossible question, why I'm\n\n1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:24.180\n here. I'm going to let you do that. Let the science do that, right? You guys go out in\n\n1:56:24.180 --> 1:56:28.220\n the space and look for the evidence. I'm conducting.\n\n1:56:28.220 --> 1:56:33.780\n You accept that you're here and you're just going to enjoy it. Like you're here for love,\n\n1:56:33.780 --> 1:56:34.780\n as you said.\n\n1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:40.580\n That's the thing. I think I'm here for the process of pursuing something bigger than\n\n1:56:40.580 --> 1:56:47.180\n me. Process of doing something. It's not like a model. It's not a virtue signal or anything.\n\n1:56:47.180 --> 1:56:52.980\n It just makes me happy that I fight for something bigger. Like than me, right? How boring is\n\n1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:56.820\n that? Every day you get up like, Oh my God, I'm going to buy myself this. I'm going to\n\n1:56:56.820 --> 1:57:03.100\n get this for myself. It's so boring, isn't it? So in a way, I think that's what it is.\n\n1:57:03.100 --> 1:57:09.100\n I'm grateful that I'm in a state. I don't have to fight for myself anymore. But morning\n\n1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:13.660\n people have to do that. And that's sometimes more than enough they have to do. And I salute\n\n1:57:13.660 --> 1:57:19.780\n them. They are doing fighting, saving themselves every day. But now I'm not there. I'm very\n\n1:57:19.780 --> 1:57:22.540\n blessed. That's why I'm very grateful.\n\n1:57:22.540 --> 1:57:27.860\n Still fighting for something much bigger than you. But do you still believe that you can\n\n1:57:27.860 --> 1:57:37.580\n change the world? That you can be a thing that, at least in part, helps North Korea\n\n1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:41.300\n or even broader helps alleviate some suffering in the world?\n\n1:57:41.300 --> 1:57:45.940\n So that's the thing. I was reading this book before by randomness, right?\n\n1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:46.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:57:46.940 --> 1:57:52.900\n I was like, oh my God, you're so courageous. You're amazing. I was like, no, I'm not. I'm\n\n1:57:52.900 --> 1:57:58.180\n horrible. I know myself. You don't want to tell me that. It's random why I ended up here.\n\n1:57:58.180 --> 1:58:02.980\n Like, why did I pick up English so quickly? Why do I love books? Right? I don't know why.\n\n1:58:02.980 --> 1:58:03.980\n It's random.\n\n1:58:03.980 --> 1:58:05.780\n Don't ask why. Just enjoy it.\n\n1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:13.260\n Yeah, it's just random. I think I don't know how the history will remember me. I think\n\n1:58:13.260 --> 1:58:17.860\n only thing I have to at this point to make sure is that the people after I consulting\n\n1:58:17.860 --> 1:58:22.500\n a lot of security teams, like now North Korea became a lot smarter. Like you said, they\n\n1:58:22.500 --> 1:58:28.300\n make it more disguised as a, like a suicide and a car accident. So when I die, they don't\n\n1:58:28.300 --> 1:58:35.500\n even know I got killed. I think that's a higher chance. So I think that's a thing like people\n\n1:58:35.500 --> 1:58:40.700\n are suffering, take it or not, it's your choice. And at least it's my responsibility for them\n\n1:58:40.700 --> 1:58:44.740\n to know what's going on. I think if you did not know and didn't do anything, you're not\n\n1:58:44.740 --> 1:58:51.020\n even guilty of a thing. But once you know, then you are not doing it. Then you, something's\n\n1:58:51.020 --> 1:58:58.180\n like not right. So that's what I'm doing. Like I want people to know. And then what\n\n1:58:58.180 --> 1:59:05.660\n they want to do is not my problem afterwards. Right? So my role is very small in that regards.\n\n1:59:05.660 --> 1:59:12.940\n And I just hope that we're humanized North Koreans for the first time, because we have\n\n1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:18.940\n been so dehumanized, right? Like we are like looking like robots. If you look at us marching\n\n1:59:18.940 --> 1:59:24.800\n and cry, like when your leader dies, almost seems like we don't even have the same emotions.\n\n1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:33.540\n People cannot connect us in the same level. And I think that's something is, that's something\n\n1:59:33.540 --> 1:59:36.100\n media have done it to us.\n\n1:59:36.100 --> 1:59:43.060\n And you're, you're shining a small light on this dark part of the world that I think,\n\n1:59:43.060 --> 1:59:50.500\n and you make it, you're so modest, but I think, I think you will have that little light just\n\n1:59:50.500 --> 1:59:58.200\n might be a big thing that changes that incredible amount of suffering that's happening on that\n\n1:59:58.200 --> 2:00:03.980\n part of the world. You know what I mean? You're, you're an amazing person. I'm so fortunate\n\n2:00:03.980 --> 2:00:08.060\n to get a chance to talk with you. I can't wait what you do in the future. You're, I\n\n2:00:08.060 --> 2:00:13.860\n hope you write many more books. I do hope you continue making videos, continue having\n\n2:00:13.860 --> 2:00:18.580\n conversations. You're an inspiration to me and millions of others. I really appreciate\n\n2:00:18.580 --> 2:00:19.580\n you talking with me today.\n\n2:00:19.580 --> 2:00:22.460\n I'm so honored. Thank you.\n\n2:00:22.460 --> 2:00:26.820\n Thank you. Thank you for listening to this conversation with Yeonmi Park. And thank you\n\n2:00:26.820 --> 2:00:33.460\n to Belcampo, Gala Games, BetterHelp, and 8th Sleep. Check them out in the description to\n\n2:00:33.460 --> 2:00:38.940\n support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Bob Marley. Better\n\n2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:45.640\n to die fighting for freedom than be a prisoner all the days of your life. Thank you for listening\n\n2:00:45.640 --> 2:00:57.500\n and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
