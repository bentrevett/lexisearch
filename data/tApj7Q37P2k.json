opinionated, and fun personality\n\n00:08.800 --> 00:10.360\n in the world of martial arts.\n\n00:10.360 --> 00:14.600\n And yes, he occasionally likes to talk a little trash.\n\n00:14.600 --> 00:16.680\n Given his wild online antics\n\n00:16.680 --> 00:20.800\n and his boxing match with Jake Paul,\n\n00:20.800 --> 00:23.920\n some people may forget just how dominant he was\n\n00:23.920 --> 00:28.920\n in the sport of wrestling and in MMA for most of his career.\n\n00:28.920 --> 00:32.840\n In wrestling, he is a two time NCAA Division I\n\n00:32.840 --> 00:36.280\n national champion and four time finalist.\n\n00:36.280 --> 00:39.520\n In mixed martial arts, he went undefeated for 10 years\n\n00:39.520 --> 00:44.480\n with a record of 19 and 0 before losing to Jorge Masvidal\n\n00:44.480 --> 00:47.320\n with a flying knee that caught everyone by surprise.\n\n00:47.320 --> 00:50.400\n He's also into cryptocurrency, disc golf,\n\n00:50.400 --> 00:54.840\n and is the cohost of Flow Wrestling Radio Live.\n\n00:54.840 --> 00:57.120\n This is a Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:57.120 --> 00:59.440\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:59.440 --> 01:00.720\n in the description.\n\n01:00.720 --> 01:04.920\n And now, here's my conversation with Ben Askren.\n\n01:06.440 --> 01:10.280\n Before we talk about your incredible wrestling career,\n\n01:10.280 --> 01:13.880\n your MMA career, let me ask you, I have to ask you,\n\n01:13.880 --> 01:15.600\n what did you think about the Jake Paul\n\n01:15.600 --> 01:17.340\n versus Tyron Woodley fight?\n\n01:19.080 --> 01:20.800\n Well, I thought, I mean, I'm obviously biased.\n\n01:20.800 --> 01:22.040\n I thought Tyron won.\n\n01:22.960 --> 01:25.280\n I had five rounds of three.\n\n01:25.280 --> 01:27.940\n And again, maybe this is my bias in the way I was seeing it.\n\n01:27.940 --> 01:29.800\n I thought he was more effective with the striking\n\n01:29.800 --> 01:32.560\n and he was more aggressive and Jake had more volume.\n\n01:33.500 --> 01:35.980\n But that was the only thing I would give him.\n\n01:35.980 --> 01:38.080\n And I guess a lot of people just didn't see it that way.\n\n01:38.080 --> 01:40.120\n They thought he landed more, significantly more punches.\n\n01:40.120 --> 01:42.800\n I just didn't think he really did any damage.\n\n01:42.800 --> 01:44.400\n It was a split decision.\n\n01:44.400 --> 01:46.200\n Split decision, yeah.\n\n01:46.200 --> 01:47.160\n Were you surprised?\n\n01:49.720 --> 01:51.240\n Well, it's the thing, so the thing I said\n\n01:51.240 --> 01:53.400\n when I went in to fight him, I said, we don't really,\n\n01:53.400 --> 01:54.840\n maybe he's good, maybe he's not.\n\n01:54.840 --> 01:57.800\n We really have no idea to this point, you know?\n\n01:57.800 --> 02:02.040\n And so I knew Tyron was a lot better boxing than I was.\n\n02:02.040 --> 02:05.360\n And so I thought, okay, I think it's a good likelihood\n\n02:05.360 --> 02:08.800\n that Tyron beats him up, but there's a chance\n\n02:08.800 --> 02:10.480\n that Jake's kind of good at this.\n\n02:10.480 --> 02:12.800\n And I think that's kind of what played out is\n\n02:12.800 --> 02:13.640\n he's kind of good at it.\n\n02:13.640 --> 02:15.020\n Even if you saw it the way I saw it,\n\n02:15.020 --> 02:16.960\n he still was impressive in his showing\n\n02:16.960 --> 02:19.340\n and he's obviously put a lot of time into it.\n\n02:19.340 --> 02:23.480\n So he's not bad, we'll say that much.\n\n02:23.480 --> 02:25.280\n But isn't it surprising to you that like\n\n02:25.280 --> 02:30.040\n an elite level athlete, combat athlete,\n\n02:30.040 --> 02:33.040\n lost to somebody who just takes it really seriously\n\n02:33.040 --> 02:35.340\n but is nevertheless not elite level?\n\n02:36.760 --> 02:40.380\n Hmm, but I think boxing's a really specific rule set.\n\n02:40.380 --> 02:41.920\n So I'll speak about Tyron, not myself.\n\n02:41.920 --> 02:45.000\n Tyron had good striking, but obviously\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:47.480\n it was his first boxing match ever.\n\n02:47.480 --> 02:50.980\n And within mixed martial arts, you have the fear\n\n02:50.980 --> 02:52.400\n of the takedown and the fear of the kick\n\n02:52.400 --> 02:54.920\n and fear of other things to go along with the punching.\n\n02:54.920 --> 02:56.600\n And so if you look at Tyron,\n\n02:56.600 --> 02:58.000\n throughout his MMA career last times,\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.360\n what set up his punches were like level change fakes\n\n03:02.360 --> 03:04.040\n at a takedown, they dropped, boom,\n\n03:04.040 --> 03:05.880\n and then something comes over the top, right?\n\n03:05.880 --> 03:07.720\n So there's many more elements to worry about\n\n03:07.720 --> 03:10.440\n in mixed martial arts, whereas boxing, there's only one.\n\n03:10.440 --> 03:12.080\n It was his first fight.\n\n03:12.080 --> 03:13.800\n Yes, I thought Tyron was gonna win.\n\n03:13.800 --> 03:14.680\n I thought this was gonna happen.\n\n03:14.680 --> 03:16.120\n But like I said, I mean, it's pretty evident\n\n03:16.120 --> 03:19.320\n that Jake's, he's not bad at boxing.\n\n03:19.320 --> 03:20.440\n He's pretty solid, you know?\n\n03:20.440 --> 03:23.360\n He gets in there and works hard at it, I guess.\n\n03:23.360 --> 03:26.480\n Out of 10 times, how many times do you think Jake wins?\n\n03:26.480 --> 03:27.440\n Against Tyron?\n\n03:27.440 --> 03:28.280\n Against Tyron.\n\n03:29.480 --> 03:32.040\n They fight again and again and again, like iteratively.\n\n03:32.040 --> 03:35.280\n Yeah, so I mean, part of the thing is,\n\n03:35.280 --> 03:37.440\n okay, so Jake's corner said you need a knockout\n\n03:37.440 --> 03:38.600\n going into the eighth round, right?\n\n03:38.600 --> 03:41.400\n So I think they thought, maybe they were trying\n\n03:41.400 --> 03:43.080\n to motivate him, but I don't see it that way.\n\n03:43.080 --> 03:45.960\n Because if they actually thought that he was winning,\n\n03:45.960 --> 03:47.960\n why would they encourage him to take a dumb risk\n\n03:47.960 --> 03:49.760\n when Tyron clearly has knockout power, right?\n\n03:49.760 --> 03:51.720\n It's a really stupid coaching philosophy\n\n03:51.720 --> 03:53.040\n if that's what you're thinking.\n\n03:53.040 --> 03:54.040\n So you obviously are thinking,\n\n03:54.040 --> 03:57.280\n hey, this is actually in the balance, it's competitive.\n\n03:57.280 --> 04:00.200\n And I feel like Tyron thought maybe he was winning\n\n04:00.200 --> 04:02.640\n and didn't have the urgency necessary.\n\n04:02.640 --> 04:05.880\n And so I think there's a chance he turns it up a lot.\n\n04:07.880 --> 04:10.120\n Man, I would wanna watch him again before I,\n\n04:10.120 --> 04:12.720\n so okay, I have this problem with my personality.\n\n04:12.720 --> 04:14.640\n Here's my personality, Lex.\n\n04:14.640 --> 04:16.120\n I have an issue with not being able\n\n04:16.120 --> 04:17.640\n to give really exact answers.\n\n04:17.640 --> 04:20.160\n So I hate giving you an answer that like,\n\n04:20.160 --> 04:22.360\n I don't feel like is 100% calculated.\n\n04:22.360 --> 04:24.840\n So I would like to see them go once more\n\n04:24.840 --> 04:26.720\n because I would like to see, hey, can Tyron,\n\n04:26.720 --> 04:27.960\n because if Tyron can turn up the pace\n\n04:27.960 --> 04:29.320\n and Jake can't handle it,\n\n04:29.320 --> 04:31.880\n then I think it's an eight, one or nine, two, right?\n\n04:32.800 --> 04:34.480\n If it goes the exact same way\n\n04:34.480 --> 04:36.120\n and maybe Tyron was a close split decision,\n\n04:36.120 --> 04:37.640\n I'm saying, oh, it's probably gonna be close\n\n04:37.640 --> 04:38.480\n every single time.\n\n04:38.480 --> 04:41.120\n We're probably gonna get a five to five type of thing.\n\n04:41.120 --> 04:45.000\n So it's like, I feel like out of one match,\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\n it's not totally indicative of what the future\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:47.840\n is gonna look like.\n\n04:47.840 --> 04:49.320\n I feel like Tyron would get a knockout\n\n04:49.320 --> 04:52.080\n and then you would still be in the same place,\n\n04:52.080 --> 04:56.160\n like not knowing what to predict.\n\n04:56.160 --> 05:00.080\n Okay, so your fight with Jake Paul,\n\n05:00.080 --> 05:03.480\n looking back, you had a little bit of time now.\n\n05:03.480 --> 05:05.080\n How would you analyze that fight?\n\n05:06.960 --> 05:08.920\n Well, I mean, the fight specifically,\n\n05:08.920 --> 05:10.760\n I got cracked with an overhand right,\n\n05:10.760 --> 05:12.640\n so I mean, it kind of sucks.\n\n05:12.640 --> 05:16.960\n I would say, and this is where everyone's like,\n\n05:16.960 --> 05:20.120\n I really don't care and everyone's like,\n\n05:20.120 --> 05:20.960\n why would you do that?\n\n05:20.960 --> 05:21.880\n It turns your reputation.\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:23.640\n It's like, well, I wanted to do it.\n\n05:23.640 --> 05:26.360\n I had an enjoyable time training and in the buildup.\n\n05:26.360 --> 05:29.720\n Obviously, I wasn't skillful enough to get the win,\n\n05:29.720 --> 05:33.480\n but even despite the fact that I know what's gonna happen,\n\n05:33.480 --> 05:34.640\n if someone asked me to do it again,\n\n05:34.640 --> 05:36.800\n I probably would have done it again.\n\n05:36.800 --> 05:38.600\n And so the way I was thinking about\n\n05:38.600 --> 05:40.880\n when I was deciding whether to do it or not,\n\n05:40.880 --> 05:42.000\n because I got the offer,\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.160\n it's like, okay, is this money, it can change my life.\n\n05:45.160 --> 05:46.000\n Yeah, it could, right?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.280\n It's not gonna double my net worth,\n\n05:48.280 --> 05:50.880\n but it's gonna add significantly and make my life easier.\n\n05:50.880 --> 05:52.280\n Number two is like, when I was in high school,\n\n05:52.280 --> 05:54.120\n we used to do boxing matches for free,\n\n05:54.120 --> 05:55.160\n just because we thought it was fun.\n\n05:55.160 --> 05:57.040\n When we didn't have something going on Friday night,\n\n05:57.040 --> 05:58.440\n me and my buddies would get together\n\n05:58.440 --> 05:59.840\n and we had some boxing goes on, basically,\n\n05:59.840 --> 06:01.720\n and we'd punch each other in the head.\n\n06:01.720 --> 06:03.320\n So it's like, for something I think is enjoyable,\n\n06:03.320 --> 06:05.240\n and now they're gonna pay me a whole bunch of money,\n\n06:05.240 --> 06:07.320\n yeah, sure, I'll do it.\n\n06:07.320 --> 06:10.480\n Would you, do you think if you got the rematch,\n\n06:10.480 --> 06:12.360\n if you did the rematch, would you,\n\n06:12.360 --> 06:13.680\n what are the odds you win?\n\n06:13.680 --> 06:14.520\n Okay, let's see.\n\n06:14.520 --> 06:15.360\n I'm probably not very good.\n\n06:15.360 --> 06:16.320\n I think he's pretty good, actually,\n\n06:16.320 --> 06:17.720\n and I'm not very good.\n\n06:17.720 --> 06:20.040\n Now it's probably at a low point for me,\n\n06:20.040 --> 06:22.040\n because, so when I started training for that,\n\n06:22.040 --> 06:24.100\n I was like 215 pounds, which is the heaviest I've ever been.\n\n06:24.100 --> 06:25.280\n I came off my hip surgery.\n\n06:25.280 --> 06:30.240\n I literally, when I said, yes, I'll do it,\n\n06:30.240 --> 06:32.000\n I had literally started working out the week before\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.200\n for the first time in my, since the surgery,\n\n06:35.200 --> 06:37.160\n because I wasn't able to do anything.\n\n06:37.160 --> 06:39.800\n So could I perform better?\n\n06:39.800 --> 06:41.920\n Yeah, but now after watching him box Tyron,\n\n06:41.920 --> 06:44.640\n like if you ask me, Ben, can you beat Tyron?\n\n06:44.640 --> 06:47.960\n Probably not, but I don't think I can beat Tyron.\n\n06:47.960 --> 06:48.800\n So.\n\n06:48.800 --> 06:49.640\n In boxing.\n\n06:49.640 --> 06:50.520\n In boxing, correct, in boxing, yeah.\n\n06:50.520 --> 06:52.280\n So my chances of beating him, you know,\n\n06:52.280 --> 06:55.200\n and watching that card, it's like, damn,\n\n06:55.200 --> 06:58.080\n like, it'd kind of be fun to box someone who I know sucks,\n\n06:58.080 --> 07:00.780\n who I know can beat, that's what would be fun, you know?\n\n07:00.780 --> 07:03.940\n Because like, the training, the preparation was fun,\n\n07:03.940 --> 07:07.440\n but then obviously, I got my butt kicked, that sucked.\n\n07:07.440 --> 07:08.820\n You know, can I swear on this podcast?\n\n07:08.820 --> 07:09.660\n Yeah, of course.\n\n07:09.660 --> 07:11.760\n Oh, I was gonna drop an F bomb, I wasn't quite sure, sorry.\n\n07:11.760 --> 07:13.680\n I think that sucked, is a swear.\n\n07:13.680 --> 07:14.520\n No, no, no.\n\n07:14.520 --> 07:16.800\n You could drop all of the F bombs you want.\n\n07:16.800 --> 07:20.480\n So, preparation wise, do you think you were more prepared\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:25.340\n for that fight, or the Jordan Burrows exhibition?\n\n07:27.800 --> 07:31.440\n I mean, like, how did you approach it mentally, you know?\n\n07:31.440 --> 07:33.440\n Well, the Burrows thing, I obviously, it's okay.\n\n07:33.440 --> 07:36.280\n So when I retired the first time in 2017,\n\n07:36.280 --> 07:39.040\n Burrows was the only current, like,\n\n07:39.040 --> 07:40.400\n we'll say really elite level wrestler\n\n07:40.400 --> 07:42.160\n that I'd never trained with.\n\n07:42.160 --> 07:43.960\n I was really good friends with in Nebraska,\n\n07:43.960 --> 07:45.520\n head of the coaching team, still am.\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:47.520\n And I said, hey, I just want, I'm gonna pay my own way.\n\n07:47.520 --> 07:48.360\n I want to come down and train with Jordan,\n\n07:48.360 --> 07:50.160\n because I want to see what it feels like.\n\n07:50.160 --> 07:51.600\n You know, I want to get in there and mix it up.\n\n07:51.600 --> 07:54.080\n I've mixed it up with David Taylor and Kyle Dake.\n\n07:54.080 --> 07:57.280\n I mean, there's just something about wrestling that I love.\n\n07:57.280 --> 08:00.460\n And so I flew myself down there in January of 2018,\n\n08:00.460 --> 08:02.200\n and I spent four days training with Jordan.\n\n08:02.200 --> 08:03.640\n It was a really good time.\n\n08:03.640 --> 08:06.440\n It gave me some great insight into how he thinks,\n\n08:06.440 --> 08:09.120\n and you know, what a great champion he is.\n\n08:09.120 --> 08:10.360\n What was it like training with him?\n\n08:10.360 --> 08:12.160\n Like what, can you give some insights?\n\n08:12.160 --> 08:13.000\n Yeah, of course.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:18.000\n Like what the, like how hard is the live training?\n\n08:18.560 --> 08:19.520\n Is it more drilling?\n\n08:19.520 --> 08:20.360\n Is it technical?\n\n08:20.360 --> 08:23.880\n Like how does, his, it seems like his style\n\n08:23.880 --> 08:25.400\n is very different than yours.\n\n08:25.400 --> 08:27.000\n So how does that match up in the room\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.280\n in terms of like what you learn from each other,\n\n08:29.280 --> 08:30.120\n that kind of thing?\n\n08:30.120 --> 08:31.760\n We only went full live for one,\n\n08:31.760 --> 08:33.560\n I think it was like 12 or 15 minutes ago\n\n08:33.560 --> 08:35.520\n where it was just go, wrestle.\n\n08:35.520 --> 08:38.720\n We did a bunch of simulated live,\n\n08:38.720 --> 08:41.960\n but obviously he had, so I was a senior in college\n\n08:41.960 --> 08:43.400\n and he was a freshman in Nebraska.\n\n08:43.400 --> 08:45.040\n And so we, our teams had dueled each other.\n\n08:45.040 --> 08:47.440\n He was obviously a lot smaller at that point in time,\n\n08:47.440 --> 08:49.100\n but he had followed my career.\n\n08:50.120 --> 08:52.000\n And so when I went in there, it was like,\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:54.360\n hey, I know you're really good at this position.\n\n08:54.360 --> 08:55.320\n What about this position?\n\n08:55.320 --> 08:56.160\n What are you trying to do?\n\n08:56.160 --> 08:57.720\n How exactly does it work?\n\n08:57.720 --> 09:00.120\n And then let's wrestle there, you know?\n\n09:00.120 --> 09:01.700\n And then, hey, what about this position?\n\n09:01.700 --> 09:05.520\n And so we would spend 30 to 40 minutes\n\n09:05.520 --> 09:07.560\n talking about that position.\n\n09:07.560 --> 09:08.960\n On the ground or?\n\n09:08.960 --> 09:10.840\n It was like, one was a chest wrap,\n\n09:10.840 --> 09:13.320\n one was a headlock, one was, I don't remember,\n\n09:13.320 --> 09:15.920\n it's called the, we call it the lightning dump, but it's a.\n\n09:15.920 --> 09:16.960\n The lightning dump?\n\n09:16.960 --> 09:19.280\n Yeah, my buddy's name was Lightning Luke Smith\n\n09:19.280 --> 09:21.300\n in high school and he was the first person I saw do it.\n\n09:21.300 --> 09:23.260\n So usually when I see someone do something,\n\n09:23.260 --> 09:24.920\n then I name that move after them.\n\n09:24.920 --> 09:25.760\n Got it.\n\n09:26.920 --> 09:27.760\n I know, right?\n\n09:27.760 --> 09:28.580\n Great name.\n\n09:28.580 --> 09:29.420\n It's a good name.\n\n09:29.420 --> 09:32.040\n Yeah, but so what I said with that is like,\n\n09:32.040 --> 09:33.560\n he was still trying to be the best in the world.\n\n09:33.560 --> 09:35.080\n I was just trying to go work out with Jordan Burrows\n\n09:35.080 --> 09:36.320\n because I enjoy wrestling.\n\n09:38.220 --> 09:40.240\n Is like someone who at that point,\n\n09:40.240 --> 09:42.260\n when he has five world titles at that,\n\n09:42.260 --> 09:44.400\n four or five at that point, a lot.\n\n09:44.400 --> 09:45.780\n And so he said, my high school kids is like,\n\n09:45.780 --> 09:48.020\n hey, this is a guy who's the best in the world,\n\n09:48.020 --> 09:49.880\n who's bringing someone in and saying,\n\n09:49.880 --> 09:50.760\n well, how do I do this?\n\n09:50.760 --> 09:51.600\n How do I do that?\n\n09:51.600 --> 09:52.420\n What about this?\n\n09:52.420 --> 09:53.260\n What about that?\n\n09:53.260 --> 09:58.260\n And so the level of inquisitiveness he has\n\n09:58.260 --> 09:59.460\n is really impressive.\n\n09:59.460 --> 10:01.660\n And then it's obvious why he got to the level he did\n\n10:01.660 --> 10:04.180\n because he's figuring out all these little situations.\n\n10:04.180 --> 10:05.840\n And that's honestly one of the biggest things\n\n10:05.840 --> 10:08.780\n I think wrestlers, a lot of wrestlers fail to do\n\n10:08.780 --> 10:09.900\n as they get older.\n\n10:09.900 --> 10:11.720\n Even when they get to early college age,\n\n10:11.720 --> 10:12.980\n they say, this is my style.\n\n10:12.980 --> 10:14.140\n This is what I do.\n\n10:14.140 --> 10:16.260\n I'm gonna lift and work out hard\n\n10:16.260 --> 10:19.260\n and I'm not gonna add anything to my game.\n\n10:19.260 --> 10:21.580\n Whereas you've seen many progressions\n\n10:21.580 --> 10:22.420\n in Jordan Burrows game.\n\n10:22.420 --> 10:24.460\n He just made his 10th world team.\n\n10:24.460 --> 10:27.540\n And if you have a really keen eye,\n\n10:27.540 --> 10:30.220\n you've been able to watch him change.\n\n10:30.220 --> 10:32.260\n I've been watching him since 2007.\n\n10:32.260 --> 10:34.180\n He's changed so much.\n\n10:34.180 --> 10:36.640\n And obviously still maintained a world class level\n\n10:36.640 --> 10:37.780\n almost the entire time.\n\n10:38.780 --> 10:40.900\n When you say change, like what changed?\n\n10:40.900 --> 10:42.580\n Because he's got that double leg.\n\n10:42.580 --> 10:44.500\n Yeah, but there's no double leg anymore.\n\n10:44.500 --> 10:45.340\n What's that?\n\n10:45.340 --> 10:46.220\n He like his double leg for the first time\n\n10:46.220 --> 10:48.780\n against Alex Deering, he hadn't hit it in years.\n\n10:48.780 --> 10:51.220\n Yeah, so that's like when people think about Jordan Burrows,\n\n10:51.220 --> 10:52.260\n they think about the double leg\n\n10:52.260 --> 10:54.260\n because in his early years,\n\n10:54.260 --> 10:55.740\n fire, he had a great double leg, right?\n\n10:55.740 --> 10:57.940\n And even so in those years, I would say\n\n10:58.960 --> 11:01.540\n the biggest thing with Jordan Burrows double leg\n\n11:01.540 --> 11:04.120\n wasn't his level of explosiveness,\n\n11:04.120 --> 11:05.820\n it was his level of persistence.\n\n11:05.820 --> 11:08.280\n He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot.\n\n11:08.280 --> 11:11.020\n And it would last time to be from fun, creative angles\n\n11:11.020 --> 11:13.360\n and on the screen, all of a sudden he's on you.\n\n11:13.360 --> 11:15.500\n And he was just super persistent with it.\n\n11:15.500 --> 11:17.460\n And I think that was probably the key.\n\n11:17.460 --> 11:20.220\n And then you saw, when he came out\n\n11:20.220 --> 11:22.060\n to the won the first world championship in 2011,\n\n11:22.060 --> 11:24.140\n it was kind of that type of mentality.\n\n11:24.140 --> 11:25.360\n And then shortly after then,\n\n11:25.360 --> 11:26.620\n obviously everyone was starting to lower\n\n11:26.620 --> 11:27.460\n their stance getting lower\n\n11:27.460 --> 11:28.980\n and he developed a really good like\n\n11:28.980 --> 11:30.460\n Mantis go behind series\n\n11:30.460 --> 11:32.380\n where he would go one way the other way.\n\n11:32.380 --> 11:33.520\n Then he started developing really good\n\n11:33.520 --> 11:36.600\n like low single ankle pick type thing, you know?\n\n11:36.600 --> 11:39.740\n And then his hand fighting got really tremendous,\n\n11:39.740 --> 11:43.180\n like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting was really good.\n\n11:43.180 --> 11:45.140\n And now I just commented at the 21 trials,\n\n11:45.140 --> 11:47.820\n like a few of the defensive sequences he got into,\n\n11:47.820 --> 11:48.940\n it was like, holy shit,\n\n11:48.940 --> 11:50.780\n like just not from an athletic standpoint,\n\n11:50.780 --> 11:51.900\n from a technical standpoint,\n\n11:51.900 --> 11:53.860\n the things he were doing was just tremendous.\n\n11:53.860 --> 11:55.860\n So I've seen him as someone like\n\n11:55.860 --> 11:57.980\n who's continued to reinvent themselves\n\n11:57.980 --> 12:00.740\n over the course of the last 10, 12 years.\n\n12:00.740 --> 12:04.540\n Especially as a junior and senior in college,\n\n12:04.540 --> 12:06.620\n you're exceptionally dominant.\n\n12:06.620 --> 12:08.780\n If you were to face him at the peak,\n\n12:08.780 --> 12:11.300\n both of your peaks of NCAA wrestling,\n\n12:11.300 --> 12:13.160\n could you beat him?\n\n12:13.160 --> 12:15.060\n And if you can beat him,\n\n12:15.060 --> 12:16.900\n well, of course you can beat him.\n\n12:18.060 --> 12:20.660\n How do you solve the Jordan Boroughs problem?\n\n12:20.660 --> 12:23.140\n Well, so from a folk style wrestling standpoint,\n\n12:23.140 --> 12:23.980\n Folk style, yes.\n\n12:23.980 --> 12:24.820\n Folk style.\n\n12:24.820 --> 12:27.180\n So, you know, he had some competitive matches\n\n12:27.180 --> 12:28.060\n his junior and senior year.\n\n12:28.060 --> 12:29.740\n He had a two, one win over,\n\n12:29.740 --> 12:31.500\n or maybe it's three, two over Michael Chandler,\n\n12:31.500 --> 12:33.740\n who was my teammate who's fighting in the UFC now.\n\n12:33.740 --> 12:36.740\n He had a two and win over Tyler Caldwell.\n\n12:36.740 --> 12:39.420\n So I think you can glean some insight into that.\n\n12:39.420 --> 12:40.800\n You know, he got ridden,\n\n12:40.800 --> 12:42.620\n he got so mad about this up on a podcast.\n\n12:42.620 --> 12:43.460\n So during Corona,\n\n12:43.460 --> 12:45.900\n we had to make up all kinds of bullshit to talk about.\n\n12:45.900 --> 12:49.300\n And we were doing like the last 10 years best 165s.\n\n12:49.300 --> 12:52.020\n And I said, Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute.\n\n12:52.020 --> 12:54.100\n He got so mad he wanted to come on the podcast the next day.\n\n12:54.100 --> 12:55.820\n So hopefully he doesn't listen to this and be like,\n\n12:55.820 --> 12:58.060\n fuck you, man, you know?\n\n12:58.060 --> 12:58.900\n But, you know.\n\n12:58.900 --> 12:59.820\n When was this?\n\n12:59.820 --> 13:00.780\n This is during Corona.\n\n13:00.780 --> 13:01.940\n Corona, last year.\n\n13:01.940 --> 13:02.780\n He got mad.\n\n13:02.780 --> 13:03.600\n We were talking about, we were.\n\n13:03.600 --> 13:04.440\n Before the trials.\n\n13:04.440 --> 13:05.280\n Yeah, correct, yeah.\n\n13:05.280 --> 13:09.220\n So, you know, Michael Chandler rode him for two minutes plus\n\n13:09.220 --> 13:11.020\n and that was his junior year, not his senior year.\n\n13:11.020 --> 13:11.860\n Sure, right?\n\n13:11.860 --> 13:14.060\n But it's close.\n\n13:14.060 --> 13:15.660\n So I think there's some things there.\n\n13:15.660 --> 13:16.980\n I think the interesting thing would be\n\n13:16.980 --> 13:19.220\n if I would have stuck around, right?\n\n13:19.220 --> 13:20.700\n So I chose to go into mixed martial arts\n\n13:20.700 --> 13:23.020\n after 2008, I would have been 74\n\n13:23.020 --> 13:23.860\n and he would have been 74.\n\n13:23.860 --> 13:24.740\n So we would have had to wrestle.\n\n13:24.740 --> 13:27.260\n And then I think that the freestyle Jordan Burroughs puzzle\n\n13:27.260 --> 13:29.180\n is a lot more difficult to solve\n\n13:29.180 --> 13:31.020\n than the folk style Jordan Burroughs puzzle.\n\n13:31.020 --> 13:32.660\n And I think, I don't think he would,\n\n13:32.660 --> 13:35.100\n I think he would acknowledge that he's much better\n\n13:35.100 --> 13:37.060\n at freestyle than he was at folk style.\n\n13:37.060 --> 13:39.140\n You know, although he was very good, he's better.\n\n13:39.140 --> 13:42.940\n This is like raw speed explosiveness.\n\n13:42.940 --> 13:44.300\n Present a problem to you.\n\n13:44.300 --> 13:47.840\n Well, so he was never, I mean, he didn't really excel\n\n13:47.840 --> 13:49.740\n on the mat in kind of either style.\n\n13:49.740 --> 13:53.100\n In freestyle, he has got some good lace transitions,\n\n13:53.100 --> 13:54.340\n but in folk style, like his whole,\n\n13:54.340 --> 13:55.740\n like in his entire college career,\n\n13:55.740 --> 13:59.020\n I think he has like 10 pins, which is almost nothing,\n\n13:59.020 --> 14:03.220\n you know, so he was gaining no value off the top position.\n\n14:03.220 --> 14:05.460\n He was good enough on most people to get off bottom\n\n14:05.460 --> 14:07.700\n without it being an issue, but it wasn't like,\n\n14:07.700 --> 14:09.460\n oh my gosh, this is an area where we really have\n\n14:09.460 --> 14:11.740\n to be careful, there's a lot of things here.\n\n14:11.740 --> 14:13.880\n You know, it's just, he wasn't gaining value there.\n\n14:13.880 --> 14:17.360\n Whereas in freestyle, he, I don't wanna say never,\n\n14:17.360 --> 14:19.900\n but the amount of times he gets turned is incredibly rare,\n\n14:19.900 --> 14:22.980\n very, very rare, and he does have like lace transitions,\n\n14:22.980 --> 14:24.060\n so he gets a lot of points there.\n\n14:24.060 --> 14:26.740\n So, and obviously freestyle is,\n\n14:27.620 --> 14:30.200\n it can be geared way more in the neutral position, right?\n\n14:30.200 --> 14:32.740\n Where we're only doing takedowns, so yeah.\n\n14:32.740 --> 14:37.180\n Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials,\n\n14:37.180 --> 14:38.860\n to Kyle Dake?\n\n14:38.860 --> 14:41.140\n Oh, Kyle's so, so, he's so good, right?\n\n14:41.140 --> 14:43.860\n I mean, I think, I think his performance at the Olympics\n\n14:43.860 --> 14:47.660\n was, his loss then was shocking to,\n\n14:47.660 --> 14:50.100\n I mean, we understand it happened to Kyle Dake, you know?\n\n14:50.100 --> 14:53.580\n He's been a guy who's competed with Jordan Burrows forever,\n\n14:53.580 --> 14:55.300\n and obviously he was on the losing side for a while,\n\n14:55.300 --> 14:56.900\n and now he's on the winning side.\n\n14:58.020 --> 15:00.740\n But I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip,\n\n15:00.740 --> 15:03.740\n and I think actually Kyle Dake made it feel like\n\n15:03.740 --> 15:05.100\n it's not a coin flip.\n\n15:05.100 --> 15:07.740\n Now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake isn't gonna win\n\n15:07.740 --> 15:10.260\n that match significantly more times than he isn't,\n\n15:10.260 --> 15:11.460\n is what it feels like.\n\n15:11.460 --> 15:14.300\n Yeah, I forgot which trials it was.\n\n15:14.300 --> 15:19.300\n Was it four years ago, where Kyle Dake threw him?\n\n15:19.420 --> 15:23.580\n Like he, he, you saw inklings of like,\n\n15:23.580 --> 15:27.020\n oh wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard.\n\n15:27.020 --> 15:31.860\n Yeah, so at 13, Kyle came out and he had the one throw,\n\n15:31.860 --> 15:35.080\n but then he lost one of the matches decisively,\n\n15:35.080 --> 15:39.180\n and then he was hurt in 14, and in 16,\n\n15:39.180 --> 15:41.220\n Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms,\n\n15:41.220 --> 15:45.100\n so actually in 16, at the trials we had,\n\n15:45.100 --> 15:46.460\n so Jake Herbert was number one seed,\n\n15:46.460 --> 15:47.980\n he was a former, as Guy Russell,\n\n15:47.980 --> 15:50.180\n I was a former world silver medalist.\n\n15:50.180 --> 15:52.640\n So you had David Taylor, who had not made a team yet,\n\n15:52.640 --> 15:54.740\n who is now a world champion, Olympic champion.\n\n15:54.740 --> 15:56.380\n You had Kyle Dake in the bracket,\n\n15:56.380 --> 15:58.980\n who was a two time world champion now,\n\n15:58.980 --> 16:00.440\n and you had Jaden Cox in the bracket,\n\n16:00.440 --> 16:01.700\n who had not made any teams yet,\n\n16:01.700 --> 16:03.860\n but is now, what, a four time world medalist,\n\n16:03.860 --> 16:04.980\n two time world champion.\n\n16:04.980 --> 16:07.440\n So, and then obviously Jaden came out on top of that,\n\n16:07.440 --> 16:10.620\n won his first Olympic medal, Olympic bronze medal.\n\n16:10.620 --> 16:13.980\n So Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16,\n\n16:13.980 --> 16:17.400\n and Kyle's contention the whole time,\n\n16:18.340 --> 16:19.340\n and they argued about this,\n\n16:19.340 --> 16:21.260\n so I actually did a little bit of backstabbing.\n\n16:21.260 --> 16:22.460\n Well, it's not backstabbing.\n\n16:22.460 --> 16:23.500\n And both of them, or just one of them?\n\n16:23.500 --> 16:24.500\n I didn't tell any of them.\n\n16:24.500 --> 16:26.620\n Okay, so Jordan got mad.\n\n16:26.620 --> 16:28.900\n We talked about this fake match during Corona, right?\n\n16:28.900 --> 16:30.460\n We had to make up something to talk about.\n\n16:30.460 --> 16:31.300\n Yeah, of course.\n\n16:31.300 --> 16:32.440\n There's obviously no matches.\n\n16:32.440 --> 16:34.420\n So we talked about this fake match, and.\n\n16:34.420 --> 16:36.140\n Do you stand behind that statement, by the way?\n\n16:36.140 --> 16:37.620\n Listen, here's what I said.\n\n16:37.620 --> 16:39.680\n Kyle Dake's a four time NCAA champion.\n\n16:39.680 --> 16:42.300\n Yes, I said, you gotta pick a winner.\n\n16:42.300 --> 16:44.020\n I said, Kyle Dake wins two, one\n\n16:44.020 --> 16:45.580\n on a minute and six ride time,\n\n16:45.580 --> 16:49.260\n which I mean, we're talking as close as it gets,\n\n16:49.260 --> 16:50.820\n as close as it gets for Kyle Dake,\n\n16:50.820 --> 16:52.560\n who's a four time NCAA champion.\n\n16:52.560 --> 16:54.340\n I'm sorry, we're talking.\n\n16:54.340 --> 16:55.340\n Over Jordan Burrows.\n\n16:55.340 --> 16:56.420\n Over Jordan Burrows.\n\n16:56.420 --> 16:57.260\n In a Folkestown match.\n\n16:57.260 --> 16:58.300\n In a Folkestown match.\n\n16:58.300 --> 16:59.140\n The hypothetical.\n\n16:59.140 --> 16:59.960\n Back in college or now?\n\n16:59.960 --> 17:00.800\n Completely hypothetical.\n\n17:00.800 --> 17:01.640\n Now or in college?\n\n17:01.640 --> 17:02.460\n In college.\n\n17:02.460 --> 17:04.700\n Both of them at their peaks at 165 pounds.\n\n17:04.700 --> 17:06.940\n So completely hypothetical.\n\n17:06.940 --> 17:10.540\n And so Jordan called in, he was all pissed at me\n\n17:10.540 --> 17:11.780\n for picking Kyle Dake.\n\n17:11.780 --> 17:14.700\n He wants to come on the next day and argue his point.\n\n17:14.700 --> 17:16.940\n So I said, F that, that's dumb.\n\n17:16.940 --> 17:17.860\n Oh, we had to pick a winner.\n\n17:17.860 --> 17:19.100\n We had to do something hypothetical.\n\n17:19.100 --> 17:20.540\n So then I called Kyle Dake, and I said,\n\n17:20.540 --> 17:22.260\n Kyle, Jordan's gonna come on and argue his case\n\n17:22.260 --> 17:23.200\n in the morning.\n\n17:23.200 --> 17:24.940\n If he's gonna do that, why don't you come in\n\n17:24.940 --> 17:26.340\n and argue your case?\n\n17:26.340 --> 17:29.700\n So no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast.\n\n17:29.700 --> 17:32.480\n So they both show up, and they went at it.\n\n17:32.480 --> 17:34.900\n But one of the contentions Kyle had for years,\n\n17:34.900 --> 17:36.300\n and there's still this rule,\n\n17:36.300 --> 17:40.900\n if you win a world level medal, the following year,\n\n17:40.900 --> 17:44.700\n you sit out until the very end of the American trials.\n\n17:44.700 --> 17:46.660\n And they do a best two or three.\n\n17:46.660 --> 17:49.860\n So every time previously that Kyle had wrestled Jordan,\n\n17:49.860 --> 17:52.820\n he had to come through a tournament on Saturday.\n\n17:52.820 --> 17:54.580\n Okay, probably three matches.\n\n17:54.580 --> 17:56.820\n And then on Sunday, he would wrestle Jordan\n\n17:56.820 --> 17:58.180\n in the best two out of three, right?\n\n17:58.180 --> 18:00.500\n So his contention was, I'm only wrestling Jordan\n\n18:00.500 --> 18:02.740\n at a disadvantage because I have to compete on Saturday\n\n18:02.740 --> 18:04.860\n and then competing on, which it's a fair argument.\n\n18:04.860 --> 18:05.700\n It really is.\n\n18:05.700 --> 18:08.140\n But I also see USA Wrestling's point.\n\n18:08.140 --> 18:10.060\n It's like, if someone wins a world medal,\n\n18:10.060 --> 18:11.020\n we are gonna reward them\n\n18:11.020 --> 18:13.500\n because we want that person on the team again.\n\n18:13.500 --> 18:16.900\n It's crazy though that Kyle Dake had to wrestle,\n\n18:16.900 --> 18:19.260\n because he's not wrestling bums in that division.\n\n18:19.260 --> 18:20.460\n Not bums, yeah.\n\n18:20.460 --> 18:22.260\n And yeah, I don't know.\n\n18:22.260 --> 18:23.620\n I don't know how wrestlers do it.\n\n18:23.620 --> 18:28.340\n Because you have to go to war like three matches\n\n18:28.340 --> 18:30.060\n and then face Jordan Burrows.\n\n18:30.060 --> 18:33.660\n Yeah, especially a few of those years with Dakehead,\n\n18:33.660 --> 18:34.660\n the name Andrew Howe.\n\n18:34.660 --> 18:36.740\n But it was a really competitive matches.\n\n18:36.740 --> 18:38.620\n David Taylor had really competitive matches with him.\n\n18:38.620 --> 18:40.340\n Isaiah Martinez even got in there, Deeringer.\n\n18:40.340 --> 18:42.140\n So he had some really competitive matches\n\n18:42.140 --> 18:44.700\n before he ever got to Jordan Burrows.\n\n18:44.700 --> 18:47.220\n So I never answered your initial question was,\n\n18:47.220 --> 18:48.060\n how did I feel?\n\n18:48.060 --> 18:50.020\n So the Jordan Burrows match,\n\n18:50.020 --> 18:52.380\n I was not in wrestling shape at all,\n\n18:52.380 --> 18:53.660\n meaning wrestling's heavily dependent,\n\n18:53.660 --> 18:54.580\n especially in neutral positions,\n\n18:54.580 --> 18:56.540\n heavily dependent on timing and other things.\n\n18:56.540 --> 18:58.500\n I was wrestling very, very minimally\n\n18:58.500 --> 19:00.700\n because I started fighting again.\n\n19:00.700 --> 19:03.820\n So like my athletic shape was great,\n\n19:03.820 --> 19:06.140\n but it was mainly for fighting, I wasn't wrestling.\n\n19:06.140 --> 19:10.380\n So I think they were actually trying to do Burrows,\n\n19:10.380 --> 19:12.140\n Dake at the Beat the Streets.\n\n19:12.140 --> 19:14.060\n It's the biggest fundraiser in wrestling\n\n19:14.060 --> 19:14.900\n every single year.\n\n19:14.900 --> 19:15.740\n In New York?\n\n19:15.740 --> 19:16.740\n In New York City.\n\n19:16.740 --> 19:18.140\n They usually raise like a million dollars.\n\n19:18.140 --> 19:20.660\n They started all these programs in New York City to get,\n\n19:20.660 --> 19:22.620\n which I really wonder what they're doing with the money now\n\n19:22.620 --> 19:24.060\n because they probably can't have the kids wrestling\n\n19:24.060 --> 19:25.820\n because New York's crazy.\n\n19:25.820 --> 19:26.660\n Anyways.\n\n19:26.660 --> 19:27.660\n I think New York figures out a way\n\n19:27.660 --> 19:28.740\n what to do with the money.\n\n19:28.740 --> 19:31.460\n Hence Michael Malice complaining that they're corrupt\n\n19:31.460 --> 19:32.300\n and all that.\n\n19:32.300 --> 19:34.180\n But it goes to the Beat the Streets organization\n\n19:34.180 --> 19:35.580\n who then starts the clubs in New York.\n\n19:35.580 --> 19:36.660\n So I don't know what to do with the money.\n\n19:36.660 --> 19:39.580\n Anyway, so I was called like, I don't know,\n\n19:39.580 --> 19:41.780\n two weeks before the event and said,\n\n19:41.780 --> 19:44.820\n hey, someone was supposed to wrestle Jordan Burrows.\n\n19:44.820 --> 19:45.820\n It fell out.\n\n19:46.700 --> 19:48.300\n Would you wrestle him?\n\n19:48.300 --> 19:49.140\n I said, yeah, sure.\n\n19:49.140 --> 19:49.980\n Why not?\n\n19:49.980 --> 19:51.620\n And it's like, well, they said,\n\n19:51.620 --> 19:55.500\n I trained with them for four days the year before.\n\n19:55.500 --> 19:57.460\n I had a pretty good idea how the match was going to go.\n\n19:57.460 --> 19:59.220\n It wasn't going to go so well for me,\n\n19:59.220 --> 20:01.020\n but it's like, okay, you're missing a main event.\n\n20:01.020 --> 20:03.700\n I can bring, because of where I'm at right now in my life,\n\n20:03.700 --> 20:05.180\n I can bring a lot of attention to wrestling.\n\n20:05.180 --> 20:06.860\n I can help you guys raise a bunch of money\n\n20:06.860 --> 20:08.260\n for Beat the Streets.\n\n20:08.260 --> 20:10.980\n My goal is I think I thought I could get one take down\n\n20:10.980 --> 20:13.860\n or turn on him was kind of my goal for the match.\n\n20:13.860 --> 20:15.500\n I didn't get there.\n\n20:15.500 --> 20:16.620\n He went kind of hard.\n\n20:16.620 --> 20:17.460\n He went hard?\n\n20:17.460 --> 20:18.660\n Yeah, that asshole didn't give me a point.\n\n20:18.660 --> 20:20.420\n Yeah, that.\n\n20:20.420 --> 20:21.700\n I said, this is bullshit, Jordan.\n\n20:21.700 --> 20:23.700\n I told him during the match, like, this is bullshit.\n\n20:23.700 --> 20:25.460\n You're fucking going too hard right now.\n\n20:25.460 --> 20:26.300\n I'm not a wrestler.\n\n20:26.300 --> 20:27.140\n I'm not a wrestler anymore.\n\n20:27.140 --> 20:27.980\n I'm a fighter.\n\n20:27.980 --> 20:28.820\n I'm coming in here.\n\n20:28.820 --> 20:30.180\n So yeah, so I had a really good idea.\n\n20:30.180 --> 20:31.460\n I mean, we wrestled together.\n\n20:31.460 --> 20:33.380\n I think he'll probably get mad\n\n20:33.380 --> 20:35.500\n because I think in the live go,\n\n20:35.500 --> 20:36.940\n we did like the 12 or 15 minutes.\n\n20:36.940 --> 20:39.300\n I think I actually scored a take down in that, I believe.\n\n20:39.300 --> 20:40.860\n Maybe, or maybe it was a turn.\n\n20:40.860 --> 20:43.540\n He'll probably say, no, I didn't, but whatever.\n\n20:43.540 --> 20:45.820\n Yeah, so I knew what was going to happen.\n\n20:45.820 --> 20:47.900\n I knew what the outcome was going to be.\n\n20:47.900 --> 20:49.940\n I knew I could probably, I was hoping I could stay competitive\n\n20:49.940 --> 20:51.780\n and maybe, you know, lose like 10, two or something.\n\n20:51.780 --> 20:53.700\n Like, yeah.\n\n20:53.700 --> 20:54.780\n Well, let's walk back.\n\n20:54.780 --> 20:57.580\n Cause I think I originally brought it up\n\n20:57.580 --> 21:01.500\n in terms of how prepared were you against Jake Paul\n\n21:01.500 --> 21:03.500\n versus Jordan Burrows.\n\n21:03.500 --> 21:07.340\n So did you prepare for Jake, cardio wise?\n\n21:07.340 --> 21:08.820\n Yeah, I worked hard.\n\n21:08.820 --> 21:09.660\n Yeah, I did.\n\n21:09.660 --> 21:13.340\n But it was, I told you, I started training for my,\n\n21:13.340 --> 21:15.740\n I mean, once I had my hip surgery,\n\n21:15.740 --> 21:17.980\n they said, you know, for the first six weeks,\n\n21:17.980 --> 21:19.620\n you can't even walk.\n\n21:19.620 --> 21:20.860\n And it was hard for me to listen to them\n\n21:20.860 --> 21:23.540\n cause by week four and a half, five,\n\n21:23.540 --> 21:24.380\n I was feeling pretty good.\n\n21:24.380 --> 21:25.260\n I want to get rid of my crutches.\n\n21:25.260 --> 21:26.500\n But I'm like, you know what?\n\n21:26.500 --> 21:28.460\n This is for the rest of my life.\n\n21:28.460 --> 21:29.300\n And if you get the,\n\n21:29.300 --> 21:31.180\n so if you get the real hip replacement,\n\n21:31.180 --> 21:33.180\n there's no wrestling, there's no nothing, right?\n\n21:33.180 --> 21:34.180\n So that's the next step.\n\n21:34.180 --> 21:35.020\n So, okay.\n\n21:35.020 --> 21:35.900\n I'm going to take this serious.\n\n21:35.900 --> 21:37.540\n So I do my crutches for six weeks.\n\n21:37.540 --> 21:41.740\n The next six weeks, it's still like really low weight bearing.\n\n21:41.740 --> 21:43.260\n Can't necessarily do anything, you know?\n\n21:43.260 --> 21:45.380\n So then I get done with the three months,\n\n21:45.380 --> 21:48.020\n which is like January and I'm like, okay,\n\n21:48.020 --> 21:49.020\n I should start working out.\n\n21:49.020 --> 21:51.700\n So I started riding a bike a little bit and then, okay,\n\n21:51.700 --> 21:52.660\n I'm now I'm fat.\n\n21:52.660 --> 21:53.500\n I'm fucking fat.\n\n21:53.500 --> 21:54.340\n I'm going to get in better shape\n\n21:54.340 --> 21:55.180\n cause I haven't been able to do anything.\n\n21:55.180 --> 21:56.940\n So I'm actually start working out.\n\n21:56.940 --> 21:59.420\n And, and then that happened, right?\n\n21:59.420 --> 22:01.380\n So I'm like, okay, well now I got three months\n\n22:01.380 --> 22:03.980\n and it gives me a good reason to get back in shape.\n\n22:03.980 --> 22:08.820\n And, you know, I knew I wasn't going to be a full time boxer.\n\n22:08.820 --> 22:11.420\n So it's like, how do I put a boxing camp together?\n\n22:11.420 --> 22:14.420\n So I found, you know, I had my old teammate, Mike Rhodes.\n\n22:14.420 --> 22:18.220\n He came up and kind of lived with me ish kind of thing\n\n22:18.220 --> 22:19.940\n for three months.\n\n22:19.940 --> 22:23.100\n I found a couple of his guy canine out of Michigan.\n\n22:23.100 --> 22:24.580\n He came over three weeks.\n\n22:24.580 --> 22:25.540\n He was great.\n\n22:25.540 --> 22:26.980\n I went to Freddie Roach for a week.\n\n22:26.980 --> 22:28.860\n So I kind of like, you know,\n\n22:28.860 --> 22:31.020\n try to get as many good as ideas as I could.\n\n22:31.020 --> 22:34.220\n And my thought was like, okay, well if this dude sucks,\n\n22:34.220 --> 22:36.620\n I can just be tough and, you know, block a few punches,\n\n22:36.620 --> 22:38.260\n get him tired and then beat him up.\n\n22:38.260 --> 22:40.740\n If he's good, that's probably not much of my do about\n\n22:40.740 --> 22:41.580\n in the next three months.\n\n22:41.580 --> 22:44.220\n Cause I'm, I was never good at boxing in the first place.\n\n22:44.220 --> 22:47.460\n All of my standup in mixed martial arts was predicated on\n\n22:47.460 --> 22:49.340\n how do I get through the two or three punches\n\n22:49.340 --> 22:51.020\n that are gonna come at me in the time I need\n\n22:51.020 --> 22:52.380\n to get a hold of them.\n\n22:52.380 --> 22:54.180\n You know, it's all, you only have to make two\n\n22:54.180 --> 22:55.020\n or three of them miss.\n\n22:55.020 --> 22:57.780\n And then boom, you're on top of them, at least for me.\n\n22:57.780 --> 22:59.380\n That was all my striking was predicated on.\n\n22:59.380 --> 23:01.540\n It wasn't about, hey, I'm gonna do damage on the feet\n\n23:01.540 --> 23:02.660\n in order to make something else happen.\n\n23:02.660 --> 23:05.660\n It was like, how do I clear this barrier,\n\n23:05.660 --> 23:06.660\n get a hold of you.\n\n23:06.660 --> 23:08.500\n And if you, I actually did the math one time.\n\n23:08.500 --> 23:09.820\n I think I got a takedown.\n\n23:10.860 --> 23:14.140\n If you include the knockout round against Masvidal,\n\n23:14.140 --> 23:16.140\n I got a takedown in every round except two.\n\n23:16.140 --> 23:18.780\n So it was like, it was like 53 out of 55 rounds in MMA,\n\n23:18.780 --> 23:19.900\n I got a takedown.\n\n23:19.900 --> 23:20.740\n Wow.\n\n23:20.740 --> 23:21.580\n Somewhere, somewhere in there.\n\n23:21.580 --> 23:24.340\n Okay, so you're hunting the takedown once you, once.\n\n23:24.340 --> 23:25.180\n Right away.\n\n23:25.180 --> 23:29.340\n Once you get your hands on them, you get the takedown.\n\n23:29.340 --> 23:30.460\n Okay.\n\n23:30.460 --> 23:32.940\n But the incredible thing about you,\n\n23:32.940 --> 23:36.460\n I just recently talked, spent a couple of days\n\n23:36.460 --> 23:37.940\n with Jimmy Pedro.\n\n23:37.940 --> 23:42.940\n And he talked about his guys and just champions in general\n\n23:43.220 --> 23:46.580\n hating to lose more than they love winning.\n\n23:46.580 --> 23:49.060\n And the way you talked about losing,\n\n23:49.060 --> 23:51.180\n you lost very few times in your career,\n\n23:51.180 --> 23:56.180\n like later you were dominating both wrestling and MMA.\n\n23:56.460 --> 23:58.780\n But the way you took these losses against people\n\n23:58.780 --> 24:03.100\n that are, I don't know, below elite level.\n\n24:03.100 --> 24:03.940\n It's fair.\n\n24:03.940 --> 24:07.940\n I was gonna get pissy, but it's completely fair.\n\n24:07.940 --> 24:09.140\n I thought he was a bum too.\n\n24:09.140 --> 24:10.380\n No, that's not what I meant.\n\n24:10.380 --> 24:11.500\n I was in trouble.\n\n24:11.500 --> 24:12.740\n It's okay, no, it's good.\n\n24:12.740 --> 24:15.100\n No, no, no, but like what,\n\n24:15.100 --> 24:17.140\n can you explain the psychology behind that?\n\n24:17.140 --> 24:21.140\n Like what, is there a system behind this?\n\n24:21.140 --> 24:22.660\n Is there a philosophy behind this?\n\n24:22.660 --> 24:26.260\n Well, I wasn't very good in the beginning.\n\n24:26.260 --> 24:27.860\n I think that's where it all starts from.\n\n24:27.860 --> 24:31.020\n So I didn't start getting good until the age of like 13.\n\n24:31.020 --> 24:32.460\n I started at five.\n\n24:32.460 --> 24:35.660\n I probably started competing more at age 10, 11.\n\n24:35.660 --> 24:37.220\n Didn't really get good until 13.\n\n24:37.220 --> 24:38.260\n It's still at 13.\n\n24:38.260 --> 24:40.180\n I'm starting to get great.\n\n24:40.180 --> 24:41.380\n I'm getting better, right?\n\n24:41.380 --> 24:42.900\n I'm pretty good.\n\n24:42.900 --> 24:44.180\n So I actually have,\n\n24:44.180 --> 24:46.220\n I have written this book on sports psych,\n\n24:46.220 --> 24:49.900\n but I got someone to write it for me kind of thing.\n\n24:49.900 --> 24:51.540\n Cause I've had this philosophy for years\n\n24:51.540 --> 24:54.260\n that there has to be this balance between two things, right?\n\n24:54.260 --> 24:56.580\n So on the one hand, in this category,\n\n24:56.580 --> 24:59.140\n on the one hand you have hating to lose.\n\n24:59.140 --> 25:02.100\n A great champion has to hate to lose, like you said, right?\n\n25:02.100 --> 25:03.020\n But on this other hand,\n\n25:03.020 --> 25:07.940\n you have to have someone who seeks out challenges, right?\n\n25:07.940 --> 25:08.860\n Cause if you don't have that,\n\n25:08.860 --> 25:10.540\n you're never gonna reach your full potential either.\n\n25:10.540 --> 25:12.940\n And so you have to balance these two balls\n\n25:12.940 --> 25:14.460\n at the same time, right?\n\n25:14.460 --> 25:16.780\n And so like for me, I always,\n\n25:16.780 --> 25:18.340\n and this is maybe cause I wasn't good,\n\n25:18.340 --> 25:19.380\n but I was always like,\n\n25:19.380 --> 25:21.540\n let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time.\n\n25:21.540 --> 25:24.140\n Let me go find, I would like literally,\n\n25:24.140 --> 25:24.980\n like seventh, eighth grade\n\n25:24.980 --> 25:26.300\n when I was starting to get better,\n\n25:26.300 --> 25:28.020\n it was like, and there's no internet.\n\n25:28.020 --> 25:30.060\n Well, there's no one was using the internet.\n\n25:30.060 --> 25:31.180\n It was like a wrestling magazine.\n\n25:31.180 --> 25:32.980\n And like, hey dad, there's a tournament here.\n\n25:32.980 --> 25:34.260\n I think that, are the kids gonna be there?\n\n25:34.260 --> 25:37.740\n Can you take me two hours across the state today, please?\n\n25:37.740 --> 25:40.460\n You would wrestle like in competition against them.\n\n25:40.460 --> 25:41.300\n In competition.\n\n25:41.300 --> 25:42.140\n Yeah, yeah, in competition.\n\n25:42.140 --> 25:43.540\n Hey, I heard there's this tournament.\n\n25:43.540 --> 25:45.620\n Here's the magazine, this is this tournament.\n\n25:45.620 --> 25:47.020\n Hey dad, will you take me over there tomorrow?\n\n25:47.020 --> 25:48.620\n You weren't trying to win.\n\n25:48.620 --> 25:50.260\n You were trying to get the experience.\n\n25:50.260 --> 25:51.820\n I was trying to wrestle the best guys.\n\n25:51.820 --> 25:52.980\n Maybe I win, maybe I lose.\n\n25:52.980 --> 25:54.700\n There's no, when you do a competition,\n\n25:54.700 --> 25:57.180\n there's no guarantee of a winner or a loss.\n\n25:57.180 --> 25:58.780\n You're just doing competition, right?\n\n25:58.780 --> 25:59.860\n So I wanted to go,\n\n25:59.860 --> 26:02.660\n I wanted to challenge myself against the best guys\n\n26:02.660 --> 26:05.100\n of which I thought maybe I could come out on top, right?\n\n26:05.100 --> 26:07.860\n So like eighth grade year, I won way way,\n\n26:07.860 --> 26:09.900\n I probably lost a handful of times\n\n26:09.900 --> 26:11.300\n in the state of Wisconsin.\n\n26:11.300 --> 26:12.460\n It was probably really, really minimal\n\n26:12.460 --> 26:13.940\n the amount of times I lost, you know?\n\n26:13.940 --> 26:15.540\n But it was just about getting the challenge.\n\n26:15.540 --> 26:19.220\n And it's like, some kids, and not kids in my club,\n\n26:19.220 --> 26:20.580\n because I'll push them very hard on this,\n\n26:20.580 --> 26:22.780\n are scared of challenging themselves.\n\n26:22.780 --> 26:25.340\n They like being the big fish in the small pond.\n\n26:25.340 --> 26:26.580\n They're not willing to go say,\n\n26:26.580 --> 26:29.060\n I want to go get that guy, and I want to get that guy,\n\n26:29.060 --> 26:30.140\n and I want to get that guy.\n\n26:30.140 --> 26:32.980\n And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me\n\n26:32.980 --> 26:34.540\n is like, I always just loved to challenge.\n\n26:34.540 --> 26:36.940\n I enjoyed competing thoroughly, right?\n\n26:36.940 --> 26:38.620\n And I understood from a young age,\n\n26:38.620 --> 26:40.540\n because it wasn't a good, losing is a part of it.\n\n26:40.540 --> 26:41.860\n You're not always going to win.\n\n26:41.860 --> 26:43.020\n And that was kind of it.\n\n26:43.020 --> 26:44.780\n It's like, hey, sometimes, you know,\n\n26:44.780 --> 26:49.300\n and for my MMA career, I never planned it to go that way,\n\n26:49.300 --> 26:51.180\n but yeah, I didn't lose for nine years.\n\n26:51.180 --> 26:52.620\n And like, that's pretty rare.\n\n26:52.620 --> 26:54.340\n I didn't plan for that to happen.\n\n26:54.340 --> 26:55.660\n That was just what happened, you know?\n\n26:55.660 --> 26:58.540\n Okay, but you also didn't lose\n\n26:58.540 --> 27:00.660\n like the second part of your college career.\n\n27:00.660 --> 27:03.340\n My 87, I lost, I won my last 87 matches.\n\n27:03.340 --> 27:04.980\n Yeah.\n\n27:04.980 --> 27:08.180\n So that didn't come along with the hatred of losing?\n\n27:08.180 --> 27:09.020\n You just.\n\n27:09.020 --> 27:10.580\n I don't like losing, I still don't like it.\n\n27:10.580 --> 27:11.420\n Yeah.\n\n27:11.420 --> 27:15.180\n But you seem to, okay, but you don't,\n\n27:15.180 --> 27:17.500\n you don't seem, you seem to kind of shrug it off\n\n27:17.500 --> 27:18.340\n a little bit.\n\n27:18.340 --> 27:20.700\n Okay, so like with, specifically with these two instances\n\n27:20.700 --> 27:21.540\n that you bring up.\n\n27:21.540 --> 27:25.500\n With the Masvidal, it feels definitely, so, okay.\n\n27:25.500 --> 27:26.340\n All right, let's.\n\n27:26.340 --> 27:27.180\n Let's go, let's go deep, let's go deep.\n\n27:27.180 --> 27:28.020\n All right.\n\n27:28.020 --> 27:29.140\n So the Masvidal one, it feels different,\n\n27:29.140 --> 27:30.660\n because I had.\n\n27:30.660 --> 27:31.780\n So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n27:31.780 --> 27:33.380\n Let's, for people who don't know.\n\n27:33.380 --> 27:34.220\n Okay.\n\n27:34.220 --> 27:36.340\n Masvidal loss was your first loss.\n\n27:36.340 --> 27:37.180\n First loss.\n\n27:37.180 --> 27:38.020\n In MMA.\n\n27:38.020 --> 27:38.840\n Yes.\n\n27:38.840 --> 27:39.680\n Yeah.\n\n27:39.680 --> 27:41.540\n I mean, it was a dramatic loss.\n\n27:41.540 --> 27:42.380\n Very dramatic.\n\n27:42.380 --> 27:45.580\n And there was this kind of buildup as you were potentially\n\n27:45.580 --> 27:49.840\n one of the greats of all time coming into this fight.\n\n27:50.900 --> 27:53.780\n And so, this pressure, all of that.\n\n27:53.780 --> 27:56.220\n So the, no, I mean, I was thoroughly enjoying it.\n\n27:56.220 --> 27:58.220\n I didn't feel the pressure.\n\n27:58.220 --> 28:03.060\n So the Masvidal fight is, he got one fucking move on me.\n\n28:03.060 --> 28:04.460\n It's not like he beat me.\n\n28:04.460 --> 28:06.440\n And if we do that again, I think I win.\n\n28:06.440 --> 28:09.980\n At that point in my life, for sure, I think I win\n\n28:09.980 --> 28:12.300\n way, way, way more times than I lose.\n\n28:12.300 --> 28:13.300\n He knew that too.\n\n28:13.300 --> 28:15.540\n That's why he didn't want to sound the bout agreement.\n\n28:15.540 --> 28:17.100\n That's why I had to taunt him and why he got so mad,\n\n28:17.100 --> 28:18.220\n because I had to continue to taunt him\n\n28:18.220 --> 28:21.140\n in order to get him to sign, right?\n\n28:21.140 --> 28:23.740\n So that one hurt because, as people don't know,\n\n28:23.740 --> 28:24.980\n my MMA career, I'll just go through it fast.\n\n28:24.980 --> 28:27.460\n I did three fights in like smaller leagues.\n\n28:27.460 --> 28:28.580\n I got signed by Bellator.\n\n28:28.580 --> 28:30.540\n I was undefeated for three and a half years.\n\n28:30.540 --> 28:31.500\n I was nine and oh.\n\n28:31.500 --> 28:36.500\n When I got done with that in 2012, 2013,\n\n28:37.960 --> 28:39.520\n I, at that point in my head,\n\n28:39.520 --> 28:41.360\n I was just going to transition to the UFC\n\n28:41.360 --> 28:42.360\n because that's where you go.\n\n28:42.360 --> 28:44.160\n I was ranked like sixth in the world.\n\n28:44.160 --> 28:46.520\n I hadn't really had a competitive match\n\n28:46.520 --> 28:48.560\n at the end of the Bellator thing.\n\n28:48.560 --> 28:51.600\n And Dana White, for a reason still unknown to me,\n\n28:51.600 --> 28:52.800\n we still haven't had this conversation.\n\n28:52.800 --> 28:55.600\n I wish I could ask him, I should ask him sometime,\n\n28:55.600 --> 28:58.520\n chose to refuse me any entry into the UFC.\n\n28:58.520 --> 29:01.480\n He just said, I went to his office\n\n29:01.480 --> 29:03.760\n and he literally said, we're not interested.\n\n29:03.760 --> 29:05.400\n We're not going to make you an offer.\n\n29:05.400 --> 29:08.360\n Did you, did you mention something too about him,\n\n29:08.360 --> 29:09.200\n about the UFC?\n\n29:09.200 --> 29:10.560\n That was a year before that.\n\n29:10.560 --> 29:11.400\n That was a year before.\n\n29:11.400 --> 29:13.920\n And that might play a role in it, I think.\n\n29:13.920 --> 29:16.560\n So yes, what happened the year before that\n\n29:16.560 --> 29:19.400\n was I called him a liar, which,\n\n29:19.400 --> 29:20.480\n but listen, I'm writing this one\n\n29:20.480 --> 29:22.960\n because he said you can't test for drugs\n\n29:22.960 --> 29:26.020\n because I'm all natural, which you can tell by my physique.\n\n29:26.020 --> 29:28.900\n And I was always put off by the fact\n\n29:28.900 --> 29:30.620\n that so many people cheated.\n\n29:30.620 --> 29:32.940\n And I was very vocal about that.\n\n29:32.940 --> 29:35.020\n And so he had made some statement like,\n\n29:35.020 --> 29:36.100\n oh, well, there's no way you could test.\n\n29:36.100 --> 29:36.940\n I said, bullshit.\n\n29:36.940 --> 29:39.360\n You, very specifically, I said USADA does it\n\n29:39.360 --> 29:42.900\n for all other sports worldwide, you can do it.\n\n29:42.900 --> 29:43.740\n And then it was funny\n\n29:43.740 --> 29:45.340\n because I hired USADA a couple of years later.\n\n29:45.340 --> 29:46.820\n So I think he took some offense to that,\n\n29:46.820 --> 29:49.740\n but that was like a year and almost a year and a half,\n\n29:49.740 --> 29:52.140\n I think, somewhere, years later.\n\n29:52.140 --> 29:53.740\n It's not like he holds a grudge or anything.\n\n29:53.740 --> 29:58.420\n Yeah, so I literally go to Vegas.\n\n30:00.220 --> 30:01.060\n It's a long story.\n\n30:01.060 --> 30:02.380\n You can read about it other places.\n\n30:02.380 --> 30:03.660\n So I got released from a belt.\n\n30:03.660 --> 30:04.980\n It's not like this is a negotiation.\n\n30:04.980 --> 30:06.420\n I got released from my belt or contract.\n\n30:06.420 --> 30:07.280\n I said, I'm out of here.\n\n30:07.280 --> 30:09.380\n I'm going to go to the UFC.\n\n30:09.380 --> 30:12.700\n I go to Vegas, and then I was told,\n\n30:12.700 --> 30:14.340\n hey, there's no offer for you.\n\n30:14.340 --> 30:15.760\n Tough shit, you know?\n\n30:15.760 --> 30:19.420\n So then I ended up signing with one championship.\n\n30:19.420 --> 30:21.700\n I spent, what, three and a half years there.\n\n30:21.700 --> 30:23.020\n I won the belt in my second fight\n\n30:23.020 --> 30:24.940\n and retained the title the entire time.\n\n30:25.980 --> 30:26.820\n And then I just, I think.\n\n30:26.820 --> 30:27.940\n Again, dominating people.\n\n30:27.940 --> 30:29.820\n Yeah, I didn't have a competitive fight.\n\n30:29.820 --> 30:32.420\n And so I retired 18 and 0.\n\n30:32.420 --> 30:34.700\n Never, never, and for someone who loves a challenge,\n\n30:34.700 --> 30:36.260\n never getting to really challenge myself\n\n30:36.260 --> 30:37.940\n was incredibly frustrating.\n\n30:37.940 --> 30:39.340\n And I left the door open.\n\n30:39.340 --> 30:40.900\n I said, if I ever get the chance\n\n30:40.900 --> 30:41.740\n to prove I'm the best in the world,\n\n30:41.740 --> 30:42.900\n I'd love to come back.\n\n30:42.900 --> 30:45.980\n So somehow, a year later, I get traded.\n\n30:45.980 --> 30:46.900\n Trades have never happened,\n\n30:46.900 --> 30:49.580\n and this is the one and only trade ever.\n\n30:49.580 --> 30:50.840\n I've been retired for a year.\n\n30:50.840 --> 30:51.860\n I got traded.\n\n30:51.860 --> 30:52.700\n I get to come back.\n\n30:52.700 --> 30:54.540\n I fight Robbie Lawler, the first fight.\n\n30:54.540 --> 30:55.500\n I win.\n\n30:55.500 --> 30:56.620\n And then essentially, they're saying,\n\n30:56.620 --> 30:59.740\n okay, if you fight, if you beat George,\n\n30:59.740 --> 31:01.700\n you're gonna get the title shot against Marty.\n\n31:01.700 --> 31:05.780\n And it's like, this is what I've been working for\n\n31:05.780 --> 31:06.740\n the entire, I've been trying to prove\n\n31:06.740 --> 31:07.620\n I was the best fighter in the world\n\n31:07.620 --> 31:08.460\n for the last 10 years,\n\n31:08.460 --> 31:10.980\n and I've not been afforded this opportunity.\n\n31:12.420 --> 31:14.320\n So when I lost to George, that was hard,\n\n31:14.320 --> 31:18.260\n because it was something that I had waited for\n\n31:18.260 --> 31:20.160\n for a really, really long time.\n\n31:20.160 --> 31:22.220\n It was something that I thought I could compete for,\n\n31:22.220 --> 31:23.260\n but I never got the opportunity to do,\n\n31:23.260 --> 31:24.300\n so that one was hard.\n\n31:25.260 --> 31:27.780\n At the same time, from just the competitive logistically,\n\n31:27.780 --> 31:29.260\n it's like, he got me with one move.\n\n31:29.260 --> 31:31.100\n It wasn't like he beat my ass for 15 minutes,\n\n31:31.100 --> 31:33.420\n and I got beat a bunch of different ways.\n\n31:33.420 --> 31:36.420\n So that was like, fuck, if I get it again,\n\n31:36.420 --> 31:37.240\n I could have done it,\n\n31:37.240 --> 31:38.740\n but they're not gonna let me have it again.\n\n31:38.740 --> 31:40.020\n It's not like wrestling where you could go\n\n31:40.020 --> 31:42.420\n the next year or the next week or whatever.\n\n31:42.420 --> 31:43.260\n You lose at Big Ten,\n\n31:43.260 --> 31:45.000\n you go to nationals two weeks later.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:48.540\n Does that loss change you in any way, your psychology?\n\n31:48.540 --> 31:50.060\n I don't think so.\n\n31:50.060 --> 31:51.540\n It's the first loss.\n\n31:51.540 --> 31:56.340\n I mean, had I had a longer MMA career post that,\n\n31:56.340 --> 31:58.900\n there definitely would have been a lot of time spent\n\n31:58.900 --> 32:01.940\n getting better at the entry point to the takedown, right?\n\n32:01.940 --> 32:03.900\n Which I already spent time there,\n\n32:03.900 --> 32:06.840\n and I hate making excuses, but yeah, the hip,\n\n32:06.840 --> 32:09.260\n the hinging of my hip, what I couldn't do,\n\n32:09.260 --> 32:11.400\n was preventing me from doing some things,\n\n32:11.400 --> 32:12.940\n and it's why, if you look at the fight,\n\n32:12.940 --> 32:15.480\n I'm bent over as I go for the double leg.\n\n32:15.480 --> 32:16.320\n Yeah, so.\n\n32:16.320 --> 32:17.260\n So what happened for people who don't know,\n\n32:17.260 --> 32:19.500\n you went in for a double leg, and he went.\n\n32:19.500 --> 32:20.340\n Flying knee.\n\n32:20.340 --> 32:22.900\n He did a flying knee, and it caught you well.\n\n32:22.900 --> 32:24.580\n Specifically the way he did that knee\n\n32:24.580 --> 32:25.900\n was kind of different than the way\n\n32:25.900 --> 32:28.360\n anyone had thrown flying knees before.\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:31.080\n Most people go more just from a stand straight vertical,\n\n32:31.080 --> 32:33.180\n whereas he took a few like running steps\n\n32:33.180 --> 32:34.340\n and went more, you know,\n\n32:34.340 --> 32:37.620\n the trajectory of the angle was different.\n\n32:37.620 --> 32:39.740\n So I think that's kind of probably why it caught,\n\n32:39.740 --> 32:42.420\n you know, I think a lot of things in combat,\n\n32:42.420 --> 32:43.260\n well, probably everything,\n\n32:43.260 --> 32:44.820\n but I focus specifically on combat,\n\n32:44.820 --> 32:45.880\n happen subconsciously.\n\n32:45.880 --> 32:48.620\n Like our brain is reading what's coming at us,\n\n32:48.620 --> 32:50.940\n and lots of times it's stuff we've seen before\n\n32:50.940 --> 32:53.140\n so we can judge how to move correctly.\n\n32:53.140 --> 32:54.740\n And you misread because it's something\n\n32:54.740 --> 32:55.620\n you haven't seen before.\n\n32:55.620 --> 32:58.360\n Had not seen him come at that specific angle, yeah.\n\n32:58.360 --> 32:59.860\n So that loss was really hard.\n\n32:59.860 --> 33:02.140\n With the Burroughs one, I told you,\n\n33:02.140 --> 33:03.240\n I knew I was gonna lose.\n\n33:03.240 --> 33:05.340\n So it was like, whatever, you know?\n\n33:05.340 --> 33:07.800\n I'm taking this because I want to put\n\n33:07.800 --> 33:09.580\n the sport of wrestling out there in a big way.\n\n33:09.580 --> 33:10.980\n I wanna help them raise a lot of money.\n\n33:10.980 --> 33:12.660\n We sold at Madison Square Garden,\n\n33:12.660 --> 33:14.460\n Hulu Theater, and we raised a whole bunch of money.\n\n33:14.460 --> 33:16.260\n So my goals were accomplished.\n\n33:16.260 --> 33:18.180\n Jake Paul fight, I took it because\n\n33:18.180 --> 33:19.020\n they paid me a whole bunch of money,\n\n33:19.020 --> 33:20.020\n and I thought it was gonna be fun.\n\n33:20.020 --> 33:21.940\n Did I have any illusion I was a great boxer?\n\n33:21.940 --> 33:23.720\n No illusions whatsoever.\n\n33:23.720 --> 33:25.180\n Would I have preferred to win?\n\n33:25.180 --> 33:27.800\n Absolutely, but like I told everyone,\n\n33:27.800 --> 33:29.300\n whether I win or lose on Saturday night,\n\n33:29.300 --> 33:31.180\n I'm gonna be back coaching wrestling on Monday,\n\n33:31.180 --> 33:32.380\n because that's what I enjoy doing,\n\n33:32.380 --> 33:34.300\n and I was back coaching wrestling on Monday.\n\n33:34.300 --> 33:35.900\n And once I'm out, these middle school kids\n\n33:35.900 --> 33:38.060\n give me a little bit of shit about it.\n\n33:38.060 --> 33:38.900\n That's it.\n\n33:38.900 --> 33:41.920\n But where were you in terms of your shape\n\n33:41.920 --> 33:44.940\n and how you felt in the Mazodal fight?\n\n33:44.940 --> 33:46.400\n Would you say you're on the,\n\n33:46.400 --> 33:48.300\n I mean, it's a difficult question to ask\n\n33:48.300 --> 33:51.460\n of a world class athlete, but like,\n\n33:51.460 --> 33:54.540\n were you past peak?\n\n33:54.540 --> 33:58.020\n Oh yeah, I don't know why guys like to lie about that.\n\n33:58.020 --> 34:00.460\n I mean, the peak for me was really evidently\n\n34:00.460 --> 34:04.660\n in my late 20s, and maybe they are all fueled\n\n34:04.660 --> 34:07.420\n by extra supplements, I don't know.\n\n34:07.420 --> 34:09.100\n But for me, that was evident.\n\n34:09.100 --> 34:11.580\n But you get this, so you get this crosshair\n\n34:11.580 --> 34:16.020\n where if you're smart, like I mentioned John Burrows was,\n\n34:16.020 --> 34:18.180\n you're still gaining wisdom, you're gaining strategy,\n\n34:18.180 --> 34:19.820\n you're gaining a lot of things, right?\n\n34:19.820 --> 34:22.140\n And so while your physicality may go down,\n\n34:22.140 --> 34:24.540\n your overall skill level still may be rising,\n\n34:24.540 --> 34:28.060\n especially in MMA because people usually start later\n\n34:28.060 --> 34:29.860\n because they're gaining wisdom, strategy,\n\n34:29.860 --> 34:32.060\n all of the, maybe more tools in their toolbox, right?\n\n34:32.060 --> 34:32.980\n They're getting all these things.\n\n34:32.980 --> 34:35.420\n So their actual competitive peak,\n\n34:35.420 --> 34:37.080\n despite their athletic peak going down,\n\n34:37.080 --> 34:39.820\n might still be a few years past that, right?\n\n34:39.820 --> 34:41.740\n Because these things are crossing.\n\n34:41.740 --> 34:43.360\n No, so I felt I was great.\n\n34:43.360 --> 34:46.260\n Obviously the hip was an issue.\n\n34:46.260 --> 34:51.260\n It's funny because I knew I had a lot of pain here,\n\n34:51.460 --> 34:53.060\n and I knew it was because of this.\n\n34:53.060 --> 34:54.220\n And it was like, okay, whenever I'm done,\n\n34:54.220 --> 34:56.560\n I'll just get it taken care of, whatever.\n\n34:56.560 --> 34:58.660\n But every time I train, I have pain kind of like\n\n34:58.660 --> 35:02.220\n all up my back, and the day after the surgery,\n\n35:02.220 --> 35:05.340\n I woke up and there was no pain on the right side of my,\n\n35:05.340 --> 35:06.460\n the surgery was on the left side.\n\n35:06.460 --> 35:07.740\n There was no pain on the right side of my back.\n\n35:07.740 --> 35:08.980\n I'm like, that's fucking weird.\n\n35:08.980 --> 35:10.260\n Like every morning I wake up,\n\n35:10.260 --> 35:12.100\n there's a lot of pain there, you know?\n\n35:12.100 --> 35:14.460\n I'm like, okay, well I'm on pain pills.\n\n35:14.460 --> 35:16.140\n Maybe it'll come back tomorrow.\n\n35:16.140 --> 35:19.160\n And that's because I'd never been back since my hip surgery.\n\n35:19.160 --> 35:21.220\n So it was weird, because it was like this,\n\n35:21.220 --> 35:23.120\n I thought this was affecting this,\n\n35:23.120 --> 35:26.460\n but it was affecting all the way across my whole back.\n\n35:26.460 --> 35:28.700\n So if I get to get a new hip, honestly,\n\n35:28.700 --> 35:31.460\n if I, I don't know if this is gonna change\n\n35:31.460 --> 35:33.660\n the competitive outcome whatsoever.\n\n35:33.660 --> 35:36.620\n If I had known how good the hip replacement was gonna be,\n\n35:36.620 --> 35:38.560\n I would have done it the second I retired\n\n35:38.560 --> 35:41.520\n from one championship in November of 2017.\n\n35:41.520 --> 35:44.780\n I would have had my hip surgery scheduled for December 1.\n\n35:44.780 --> 35:46.300\n Just from a lifestyle standpoint,\n\n35:46.300 --> 35:48.420\n I could only sleep in one position.\n\n35:48.420 --> 35:49.620\n There was a lot of things I couldn't do.\n\n35:49.620 --> 35:51.260\n I was in a lot of pain.\n\n35:51.260 --> 35:52.740\n So I would have done that a lot earlier.\n\n35:52.740 --> 35:55.780\n But no, from an athletic point, I was ready.\n\n35:55.780 --> 35:57.340\n This shit goes wrong sometimes.\n\n35:58.500 --> 36:00.440\n I don't know how to ask this, but you know,\n\n36:00.440 --> 36:05.440\n Joe Rogan, me, had a sense about you similar to like Fedor,\n\n36:08.180 --> 36:11.100\n that you are potentially one of the greatest ever.\n\n36:11.100 --> 36:12.140\n Yeah.\n\n36:12.140 --> 36:15.500\n Does it hurt that you're not in the discussion now\n\n36:15.500 --> 36:19.500\n of being in the top 10 of all time?\n\n36:19.500 --> 36:20.660\n I didn't prove it.\n\n36:20.660 --> 36:21.980\n I don't deserve it.\n\n36:21.980 --> 36:23.540\n Biera, I mean.\n\n36:23.540 --> 36:24.600\n But I didn't prove it.\n\n36:24.600 --> 36:29.100\n I mean, and so it's like, had I somehow gotten\n\n36:29.100 --> 36:32.140\n to convince Dana White, we go and convince him in 2013\n\n36:32.140 --> 36:35.060\n to make me an offer, and I didn't even need a good offer.\n\n36:35.060 --> 36:36.160\n I just needed any offer.\n\n36:36.160 --> 36:37.780\n Had I gotten the offer then,\n\n36:37.780 --> 36:39.780\n maybe the outcome's different, right?\n\n36:39.780 --> 36:42.020\n But given, I would never expect anyone\n\n36:42.020 --> 36:43.180\n to think of me that way.\n\n36:43.180 --> 36:44.060\n I didn't prove it.\n\n36:44.060 --> 36:47.420\n I know what I was, and I'm good with that.\n\n36:47.420 --> 36:49.140\n And yeah, other people never got to see that.\n\n36:49.140 --> 36:51.980\n Do you think, well, you can't know fully, right?\n\n36:51.980 --> 36:55.780\n Do you think if you went to the UFC at that time\n\n36:55.780 --> 36:56.860\n instead of one championship?\n\n36:56.860 --> 36:59.200\n I think I would have had a lot of success.\n\n36:59.200 --> 37:01.040\n Yeah, I mean, there's obviously certain guys,\n\n37:01.040 --> 37:02.340\n there's a lot of guys I've trained with\n\n37:02.340 --> 37:05.580\n that I had a lot of really good results against.\n\n37:05.580 --> 37:10.580\n And obviously, Tyron was a champion for a long time there.\n\n37:12.220 --> 37:13.820\n So I was around, Tyron was a champion,\n\n37:13.820 --> 37:15.140\n Anthony was a champion at lightweight.\n\n37:15.140 --> 37:17.300\n I was, you know, same gym as him,\n\n37:17.300 --> 37:19.300\n and we had a lot of people coming through.\n\n37:19.300 --> 37:20.140\n Yeah, I.\n\n37:20.140 --> 37:21.700\n Would you face Tyron?\n\n37:21.700 --> 37:22.520\n Would I have fought him?\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:23.500\n I don't think so.\n\n37:23.500 --> 37:26.300\n I mean, so he was still the champion when I came into the UFC\n\n37:26.300 --> 37:29.180\n and we said, no, we're not gonna fight.\n\n37:29.180 --> 37:30.660\n All right.\n\n37:30.660 --> 37:32.520\n Hey, so he can't change history, right?\n\n37:32.520 --> 37:33.460\n So once something happens,\n\n37:33.460 --> 37:35.060\n you gotta accept for what it is.\n\n37:35.060 --> 37:38.300\n And move forward and obviously hope you can continue\n\n37:38.300 --> 37:39.700\n to keep accomplishing great things,\n\n37:39.700 --> 37:42.380\n which for me, obviously my athletic career is over.\n\n37:42.380 --> 37:45.380\n So now it's gonna be through my wrestling academies\n\n37:45.380 --> 37:48.140\n and you know, who knows what else I get into.\n\n37:48.140 --> 37:51.300\n You might do exhibition matches\n\n37:51.300 --> 37:52.620\n and all that kind of stuff, right?\n\n37:52.620 --> 37:53.460\n Says who?\n\n37:53.460 --> 37:55.540\n Wrestling and stuff, no?\n\n37:55.540 --> 37:56.420\n I don't think so.\n\n37:56.420 --> 37:59.540\n So here's my thing with the wrestling matches is like,\n\n37:59.540 --> 38:01.740\n just for fun, if you said, hey Ben, just for fun.\n\n38:01.740 --> 38:02.580\n Yeah.\n\n38:02.580 --> 38:03.560\n Would you love to go wrestle someone?\n\n38:03.560 --> 38:05.580\n Yeah, I would, I would, right?\n\n38:05.580 --> 38:07.700\n I love wrestling, I get in there.\n\n38:07.700 --> 38:09.000\n I love, you know, I love like,\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.420\n so one of my guys has gotten to be pretty good.\n\n38:11.420 --> 38:12.940\n He's in college, he got in Keegan O'Toole.\n\n38:12.940 --> 38:16.140\n He just won a junior world title this year.\n\n38:16.140 --> 38:19.220\n And so when I'm doing private lessons,\n\n38:19.220 --> 38:21.060\n I have such think about the development of the athletes.\n\n38:21.060 --> 38:22.740\n Sometimes I can wrestle hard, but most of the time\n\n38:22.740 --> 38:24.700\n it's like, I'm just gonna help them\n\n38:24.700 --> 38:25.840\n with whatever they need help with.\n\n38:25.840 --> 38:28.520\n And it's still wrestling and it's fun, but it's helping them.\n\n38:28.520 --> 38:30.260\n You know, for like, Keegan comes back this summer\n\n38:30.260 --> 38:31.340\n and he's training for the junior world title.\n\n38:31.340 --> 38:33.660\n So to be able to just shake hands sometimes and say like,\n\n38:33.660 --> 38:35.300\n I'm gonna try to kick your ass.\n\n38:35.300 --> 38:36.320\n Should you try to kick my ass?\n\n38:36.320 --> 38:37.640\n You know, like just to go, like.\n\n38:37.640 --> 38:38.480\n Yeah, it's a good feeling.\n\n38:38.480 --> 38:39.520\n It's so much fun.\n\n38:39.520 --> 38:40.780\n And I don't get to do that very much.\n\n38:40.780 --> 38:42.660\n So if you said, Ben, would you love to do some matches?\n\n38:42.660 --> 38:44.300\n And the answer is yeah.\n\n38:44.300 --> 38:46.520\n The problem, unfortunately for me,\n\n38:46.520 --> 38:48.540\n and maybe you could talk me off a ledge here,\n\n38:48.540 --> 38:50.740\n is like, because of where I've gotten to in my career,\n\n38:50.740 --> 38:52.220\n if I choose to do a wrestling match,\n\n38:52.220 --> 38:53.780\n it's gonna, people are gonna be really excited about it.\n\n38:53.780 --> 38:56.020\n It's gonna blow up and it's just like,\n\n38:56.020 --> 38:57.380\n I just want to wrestle just to wrestle.\n\n38:57.380 --> 38:59.140\n I'd rather just like go in a room\n\n38:59.140 --> 39:00.580\n where no one can watch and just wrestle.\n\n39:00.580 --> 39:01.980\n I just enjoy it.\n\n39:01.980 --> 39:03.540\n Well, you could also wrestle.\n\n39:03.540 --> 39:05.380\n So there's different kinds of wrestling.\n\n39:05.380 --> 39:07.900\n There's wrestling where there's an event\n\n39:07.900 --> 39:11.540\n and like, you know, there's a buildup and then an announcement.\n\n39:11.540 --> 39:14.580\n And you can also do like a Khabib style,\n\n39:14.580 --> 39:16.940\n like in the room, there's cameras\n\n39:16.940 --> 39:18.860\n and you're kind of going, it's like the.\n\n39:18.860 --> 39:20.240\n Wait, Khabib does that?\n\n39:20.240 --> 39:21.660\n No, in.\n\n39:21.660 --> 39:22.480\n Marcelo does that.\n\n39:22.480 --> 39:23.320\n He whooped my ass a few times.\n\n39:23.320 --> 39:24.180\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n39:24.180 --> 39:26.340\n I mean, I've seen Khabib in some videos.\n\n39:26.340 --> 39:28.780\n It's not like set up, it's just people going hard\n\n39:28.780 --> 39:30.380\n and then it's more fun.\n\n39:30.380 --> 39:31.220\n Yeah.\n\n39:31.220 --> 39:34.380\n You know, and it's also more like\n\n39:35.380 --> 39:38.380\n presenting the beauty of the sport, you know?\n\n39:38.380 --> 39:39.220\n For sure.\n\n39:39.220 --> 39:41.780\n And like, and there's no winning or losing really\n\n39:41.780 --> 39:42.940\n in that context.\n\n39:42.940 --> 39:43.780\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n39:43.780 --> 39:45.940\n Like you're just, you're always joking around a little bit,\n\n39:45.940 --> 39:47.140\n even when you're going super hard.\n\n39:47.140 --> 39:49.340\n So I feel like, especially in the modern day\n\n39:49.340 --> 39:52.420\n with the internet, that's a compelling way to do.\n\n39:52.420 --> 39:53.660\n So I've thought about,\n\n39:53.660 --> 39:55.820\n this is the one thing I've thought about doing.\n\n39:55.820 --> 39:58.940\n Cause I told you about my buddy was the content thing.\n\n39:58.940 --> 40:00.340\n It's called Rockfin.\n\n40:00.340 --> 40:01.180\n Thought about doing, you know,\n\n40:01.180 --> 40:03.140\n the old really famous Gracie challenge.\n\n40:03.140 --> 40:03.980\n Yeah.\n\n40:03.980 --> 40:05.220\n Okay, so I've thought about doing the aspirin challenge.\n\n40:05.220 --> 40:06.140\n You wanna hear my rule set?\n\n40:06.140 --> 40:06.980\n Yeah, let's go.\n\n40:06.980 --> 40:07.980\n I'm not sure I'm gonna do this.\n\n40:07.980 --> 40:10.740\n People are gonna show up to your, like in Wisconsin.\n\n40:10.740 --> 40:11.660\n I have to select you.\n\n40:11.660 --> 40:13.220\n I'll start with a thousand bucks, right?\n\n40:13.220 --> 40:14.060\n Right.\n\n40:14.060 --> 40:14.980\n Okay, 30 minutes.\n\n40:14.980 --> 40:16.460\n You pin me or I pin you.\n\n40:16.460 --> 40:17.300\n That's it.\n\n40:17.300 --> 40:18.220\n No points, no nothing.\n\n40:18.220 --> 40:19.180\n We just wrestle.\n\n40:19.180 --> 40:20.500\n Camera, that's it, right?\n\n40:20.500 --> 40:21.340\n It's camera in the room.\n\n40:21.340 --> 40:22.460\n Maybe there's a referee\n\n40:22.460 --> 40:24.380\n cause we don't want there to be contention over the pin.\n\n40:24.380 --> 40:25.220\n So.\n\n40:25.220 --> 40:26.040\n Just one pin.\n\n40:26.040 --> 40:26.880\n Just one pin.\n\n40:26.880 --> 40:28.380\n 30 minutes, 30 minutes, okay?\n\n40:28.380 --> 40:31.560\n If I pin you, you don't get shit, you go home, right?\n\n40:31.560 --> 40:33.460\n Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand dollars.\n\n40:33.460 --> 40:35.340\n Two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, five thousand\n\n40:35.340 --> 40:36.580\n and so on.\n\n40:36.580 --> 40:37.820\n If you make it the distance\n\n40:37.820 --> 40:39.300\n and I don't pin you and you don't pin me,\n\n40:39.300 --> 40:42.100\n I'll pay for your travel and give you 500 bucks, right?\n\n40:42.100 --> 40:44.620\n Just a consolation prize for showing up.\n\n40:44.620 --> 40:47.220\n If you pin me, you get whatever the jackpot is.\n\n40:47.220 --> 40:50.740\n Wait, who's adding to the jackpot?\n\n40:50.740 --> 40:52.740\n I am, it's my money.\n\n40:52.740 --> 40:53.580\n My money.\n\n40:53.580 --> 40:55.620\n But then what's the incentive to keep winning for you?\n\n40:55.620 --> 40:56.460\n Cause the jackpot.\n\n40:56.460 --> 40:58.260\n Well, cause obviously I would put the content somewhere\n\n40:58.260 --> 40:59.100\n where people would watch it, right?\n\n40:59.100 --> 41:00.140\n Oh, so you're gonna make money.\n\n41:00.140 --> 41:01.260\n Yeah, so you'd make money that way.\n\n41:01.260 --> 41:02.700\n But it's not exponentially growing, right?\n\n41:02.700 --> 41:04.380\n It's just going up by like.\n\n41:04.380 --> 41:06.060\n Yeah, I really think there's probably only a couple people\n\n41:06.060 --> 41:06.900\n that could pin me.\n\n41:06.900 --> 41:09.260\n So I would either just not choose those people\n\n41:09.260 --> 41:11.620\n or wait till I get a really large audience\n\n41:11.620 --> 41:12.700\n and people get really excited\n\n41:12.700 --> 41:14.180\n and in that case, I'm making a lot of money.\n\n41:14.180 --> 41:15.020\n So.\n\n41:15.020 --> 41:17.700\n What do you think, how many matches would go with you,\n\n41:17.700 --> 41:19.500\n like Khaldech shows up?\n\n41:19.500 --> 41:20.860\n I don't think he could pin me.\n\n41:20.860 --> 41:21.680\n Yeah.\n\n41:21.680 --> 41:24.300\n I mean like, so Jordan Burrows could beat me,\n\n41:24.300 --> 41:25.140\n but he can't pin me.\n\n41:25.140 --> 41:26.340\n He was never a pinner.\n\n41:26.340 --> 41:27.180\n Yeah.\n\n41:27.180 --> 41:28.000\n He ain't gonna pin me.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.100\n There's only a few people who have the skill level\n\n41:30.100 --> 41:31.260\n to do so, right?\n\n41:31.260 --> 41:32.100\n It takes a lot.\n\n41:32.100 --> 41:33.500\n Cause that was, so pinning was one of my specialties.\n\n41:33.500 --> 41:35.420\n I had the fourth most of all time\n\n41:35.420 --> 41:38.500\n and I won the pinning award the last two years.\n\n41:38.500 --> 41:41.220\n So you think you can be done on points and just pin them?\n\n41:41.220 --> 41:43.980\n This is actually one of the issues I have with\n\n41:43.980 --> 41:46.980\n Jiu Jitsu and the point system and the Eddie Bravo thing.\n\n41:46.980 --> 41:48.260\n I actually think Eddie Bravo thing is kind of,\n\n41:48.260 --> 41:49.260\n people get so mad at me.\n\n41:49.260 --> 41:50.260\n Sorry, Jiu Jitsu.\n\n41:50.260 --> 41:51.700\n I think it's bullshit.\n\n41:51.700 --> 41:52.820\n And you want me to tell you why it's bullshit?\n\n41:52.820 --> 41:53.640\n Yeah.\n\n41:53.640 --> 41:55.120\n So like, if Jordan Burrows whoops my ass\n\n41:55.120 --> 41:58.460\n and the score is 16 to two, but he can't pin me.\n\n41:58.460 --> 42:00.860\n Then I get to go to overtime and get a cradle on him.\n\n42:00.860 --> 42:02.780\n I'm probably going to pin him.\n\n42:02.780 --> 42:04.700\n So I'm better than Jordan Burrows.\n\n42:04.700 --> 42:05.980\n Nah, that ain't right.\n\n42:05.980 --> 42:07.420\n He just whooped my ass.\n\n42:07.420 --> 42:08.260\n Do you know what I'm saying?\n\n42:08.260 --> 42:11.620\n Like if we can go the whole, cause they do submission only.\n\n42:11.620 --> 42:14.100\n So if Jordan Burrows beats me up for,\n\n42:14.100 --> 42:15.340\n what is it, eight minutes, 10 minutes?\n\n42:15.340 --> 42:16.180\n I don't know.\n\n42:16.180 --> 42:18.300\n What's the length of an Eddie Bravo match?\n\n42:18.300 --> 42:19.140\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n42:19.140 --> 42:21.100\n Something like that, yeah, yeah.\n\n42:21.100 --> 42:22.540\n So we go 10, me and Jordan Burrows go 10 minutes.\n\n42:22.540 --> 42:24.180\n He's gonna outscore me significantly.\n\n42:24.180 --> 42:26.300\n He will not pin me, I promise you that.\n\n42:26.300 --> 42:27.220\n Okay?\n\n42:27.220 --> 42:29.180\n So now we go to the overtime.\n\n42:29.180 --> 42:30.420\n Strong words, but yeah.\n\n42:30.420 --> 42:32.060\n He won't, Jordan Burrows is not gonna,\n\n42:32.060 --> 42:32.900\n he's gonna beat me.\n\n42:32.900 --> 42:33.860\n I will give you that.\n\n42:33.860 --> 42:35.080\n Kyle Dake won't pin you either.\n\n42:35.080 --> 42:35.920\n No.\n\n42:35.920 --> 42:36.740\n Okay.\n\n42:36.740 --> 42:38.860\n Okay, they will both beat me on points very badly.\n\n42:38.860 --> 42:40.380\n Now David Taylor, he might pin me\n\n42:40.380 --> 42:42.660\n cause he's a very good pinner also.\n\n42:42.660 --> 42:45.120\n They'll beat me very badly, they will not pin me.\n\n42:45.120 --> 42:47.340\n But now we get to the overtime and we get to pick like,\n\n42:47.340 --> 42:50.140\n right, so in Eddie Bravo you get a rear naked choke\n\n42:50.140 --> 42:51.460\n or an armbar.\n\n42:51.460 --> 42:53.540\n Okay, give me a cradle, I'll probably pin him.\n\n42:53.540 --> 42:54.900\n Okay, a good cradle.\n\n42:54.900 --> 42:56.900\n You can say cradle or maybe give them,\n\n42:56.900 --> 42:58.180\n then they're probably not gonna pin me, right?\n\n42:58.180 --> 43:00.140\n Maybe, maybe there's a chance, but probably not.\n\n43:00.140 --> 43:01.220\n Cause that's just not their specialty.\n\n43:01.220 --> 43:04.180\n So for people who don't know, the Eddie Bravo thing\n\n43:04.180 --> 43:07.300\n is when it goes into overtime,\n\n43:07.300 --> 43:09.980\n you get a dominance position on a person\n\n43:09.980 --> 43:12.180\n and you get to, yeah, basically put them in a cradle.\n\n43:12.180 --> 43:13.140\n This is the wrestling equivalent.\n\n43:13.140 --> 43:13.980\n Yeah.\n\n43:13.980 --> 43:14.820\n But you take their back or mount.\n\n43:14.820 --> 43:17.340\n Maybe an armbar, yeah, like a wrestling armbar.\n\n43:17.340 --> 43:18.620\n So, and I don't think that's very fair.\n\n43:18.620 --> 43:20.620\n Cause if someone whoops your ass, they whoops your ass.\n\n43:20.620 --> 43:22.900\n And then, you know, and so I think the reason why\n\n43:22.900 --> 43:25.500\n Jiu Jitsu people accept that rule set is that\n\n43:25.500 --> 43:27.940\n I don't think, I think they know this, but would admit it.\n\n43:27.940 --> 43:32.380\n I don't think their point scoring system adequately rewards\n\n43:32.380 --> 43:33.820\n what people value.\n\n43:33.820 --> 43:36.460\n So like in wrestling, we value takedowns\n\n43:36.460 --> 43:38.020\n cause it gets us closer to the pin.\n\n43:38.020 --> 43:41.180\n And the most valuable scoring is a near fall,\n\n43:41.180 --> 43:44.620\n near to the pin, because that's the ultimate goal to sport.\n\n43:44.620 --> 43:46.220\n Whereas in Jiu Jitsu, for example,\n\n43:46.220 --> 43:48.740\n like if I were to get a takedown,\n\n43:48.740 --> 43:52.300\n so like if I went to Gordon Ryan and he just didn't pull guard\n\n43:52.300 --> 43:54.060\n I would probably get the takedown.\n\n43:54.060 --> 43:56.100\n Now, if somehow he didn't submit me,\n\n43:56.100 --> 43:57.140\n which he probably would, right?\n\n43:57.140 --> 43:59.260\n But say he got, got close to like 12 submissions,\n\n43:59.260 --> 44:01.660\n but somehow I slipped out of all of them.\n\n44:01.660 --> 44:03.940\n Now I went to zero, like that's ridiculous.\n\n44:03.940 --> 44:05.180\n Like he should very clearly win\n\n44:05.180 --> 44:06.700\n cause he almost submitted, you know what I'm saying?\n\n44:06.700 --> 44:09.820\n Like there, and I, and I realized the difficulty.\n\n44:09.820 --> 44:12.860\n I realized the difficulty in rewarding near submissions,\n\n44:12.860 --> 44:15.780\n but that is the most valuable thing is getting close\n\n44:15.780 --> 44:17.020\n to finishing the match.\n\n44:17.020 --> 44:20.180\n And in most competitions, they don't actually reward that.\n\n44:20.180 --> 44:22.460\n But okay, so this, this isn't about the sport.\n\n44:22.460 --> 44:24.780\n This is about the Ben Askren challenge\n\n44:24.780 --> 44:25.620\n that we're talking about.\n\n44:25.620 --> 44:26.580\n Okay.\n\n44:26.580 --> 44:28.260\n What, why 30 minutes?\n\n44:28.260 --> 44:29.640\n Why not unlimited time?\n\n44:31.060 --> 44:33.540\n Why, why go until whenever?\n\n44:33.540 --> 44:34.860\n Cause then it's just a cardio thing.\n\n44:34.860 --> 44:38.340\n Cause at some point then someone would just have to fall\n\n44:38.340 --> 44:39.340\n over dead, right?\n\n44:39.340 --> 44:40.780\n There's no more skill level involved.\n\n44:40.780 --> 44:42.820\n It's just who can stand up the longest.\n\n44:42.820 --> 44:47.580\n You honestly don't think 30 minutes is a cardio thing too.\n\n44:47.580 --> 44:49.300\n How do you think that's actually going to look?\n\n44:49.300 --> 44:51.380\n How are they going against you for 30 minutes?\n\n44:51.380 --> 44:52.220\n What is that?\n\n44:52.220 --> 44:55.240\n So it's going to be kind of boring for the most part.\n\n44:56.380 --> 44:57.820\n What position are you going to be stuck in?\n\n44:57.820 --> 44:59.500\n Because you, well, you can't, but you can't,\n\n44:59.500 --> 45:01.480\n you just can't have a gigantic amount of action\n\n45:01.480 --> 45:02.320\n for 30 minutes.\n\n45:02.320 --> 45:04.260\n So I relate to this because some of my kids,\n\n45:04.260 --> 45:07.900\n when I'm teaching them wrestling, they're like, well,\n\n45:07.900 --> 45:10.580\n but I can't do that for seven minutes.\n\n45:10.580 --> 45:13.940\n And I'm like, well, you know, like say, say if I had you do\n\n45:13.940 --> 45:16.060\n hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight,\n\n45:16.060 --> 45:18.380\n as hard as you could, you're not going to last seven minutes.\n\n45:18.380 --> 45:20.620\n You're going to, your pace will slow down, right?\n\n45:20.620 --> 45:22.820\n So my thing is like, well, your pace doesn't have to step\n\n45:22.820 --> 45:24.900\n here because in wrestling, you're competing against someone.\n\n45:24.900 --> 45:27.380\n So if you're here at a hundred and you go to 80,\n\n45:27.380 --> 45:29.100\n but they go to 70, that's great.\n\n45:29.100 --> 45:31.340\n And then you go to 60, but they go to 40,\n\n45:31.340 --> 45:32.880\n this is even better, right?\n\n45:32.880 --> 45:34.460\n Because the gap is growing.\n\n45:34.460 --> 45:36.860\n So we don't necessarily, if we get tired, that's fine.\n\n45:36.860 --> 45:38.740\n If they get more tired, that's better.\n\n45:38.740 --> 45:40.440\n So I think most people would know that.\n\n45:40.440 --> 45:43.160\n So they would kind of slow it down.\n\n45:45.020 --> 45:47.820\n But yeah, I think at 30, I mean, I've wrestled 30 minute\n\n45:47.820 --> 45:51.380\n goes, I've wrestled hour long goes.\n\n45:51.380 --> 45:52.580\n You're not going to get so tired,\n\n45:52.580 --> 45:54.020\n you're going to fall over in that time period.\n\n45:54.020 --> 45:56.180\n But at some point, if it's unlimited,\n\n45:56.180 --> 45:58.420\n someone will get so tired or dehydrated\n\n45:58.420 --> 46:00.620\n that they're just going to freaking fall over.\n\n46:00.620 --> 46:01.460\n Yeah.\n\n46:01.460 --> 46:05.240\n But you think, what about making it exciting and dynamic?\n\n46:06.220 --> 46:08.760\n You think the other person is always going to be going\n\n46:08.760 --> 46:11.660\n for the pin and thereby make it dynamic.\n\n46:11.660 --> 46:12.880\n Well, if they're working that hard,\n\n46:12.880 --> 46:15.020\n then they might exhaust themselves, right?\n\n46:15.020 --> 46:17.980\n And obviously then if you're being that dynamic,\n\n46:17.980 --> 46:20.220\n then you're adding risk to yourself too,\n\n46:20.220 --> 46:22.660\n because you are doing that.\n\n46:22.660 --> 46:23.500\n Well, I love this.\n\n46:23.500 --> 46:24.460\n This is a great idea.\n\n46:24.460 --> 46:29.100\n Well, I figured I'd rack up like 20 pins against bums,\n\n46:29.100 --> 46:30.860\n or not as great people in the beginning.\n\n46:30.860 --> 46:32.900\n And then I would start bringing in better people\n\n46:32.900 --> 46:35.860\n because they would be enticed by $20,000,\n\n46:35.860 --> 46:36.700\n the possibility to win.\n\n46:36.700 --> 46:40.020\n And not much fanfare, just a camera and just local.\n\n46:40.020 --> 46:41.180\n That's it, in my wrestling room.\n\n46:41.180 --> 46:42.820\n Yeah, yeah, like the Gracie Challenge.\n\n46:42.820 --> 46:43.820\n Yes.\n\n46:43.820 --> 46:44.660\n Yeah.\n\n46:44.660 --> 46:48.100\n And so then maybe you have like, you know,\n\n46:48.100 --> 46:51.100\n for most people, you have someone edit like the 90 seconds\n\n46:51.100 --> 46:52.780\n of the most fun things that happen.\n\n46:52.780 --> 46:54.620\n And then you can watch the entire 30 minutes\n\n46:54.620 --> 46:55.460\n if you want to.\n\n46:55.460 --> 46:56.300\n Yeah.\n\n46:56.300 --> 46:57.120\n I mean, I think most people,\n\n46:57.120 --> 46:59.020\n if they're not really, really elite,\n\n46:59.020 --> 47:00.580\n I'm probably going to pin them.\n\n47:01.460 --> 47:02.860\n If they're not really elite.\n\n47:04.620 --> 47:05.580\n So, yeah.\n\n47:05.580 --> 47:06.660\n But I don't know.\n\n47:06.660 --> 47:07.640\n That's something I've been thinking about.\n\n47:07.640 --> 47:09.940\n This has been like fun for me to think about.\n\n47:11.020 --> 47:12.400\n And obviously it plays in my skill sets\n\n47:12.400 --> 47:15.980\n because my cardio is good and my pinning is good also.\n\n47:15.980 --> 47:17.140\n So, yeah.\n\n47:17.140 --> 47:21.860\n So, like you said, you weren't very good in your early days\n\n47:21.860 --> 47:23.380\n until 13, 14.\n\n47:23.380 --> 47:24.540\n What was the switch?\n\n47:24.540 --> 47:28.060\n You started to dominate people in your college career.\n\n47:28.060 --> 47:28.900\n You dominated.\n\n47:28.900 --> 47:30.140\n Yeah.\n\n47:30.140 --> 47:33.580\n And obviously you stopped losing at some point.\n\n47:33.580 --> 47:34.420\n Yeah.\n\n47:34.420 --> 47:36.460\n So, well, I would say,\n\n47:36.460 --> 47:38.060\n so even when I didn't lose in collegiate competition,\n\n47:38.060 --> 47:40.340\n I would go in the summers and try to make the world team.\n\n47:40.340 --> 47:42.980\n So, I would lose some, not a lot, right?\n\n47:42.980 --> 47:43.820\n Minimally.\n\n47:44.820 --> 47:45.660\n Okay.\n\n47:45.660 --> 47:47.540\n So, when I'm five, I start playing all sports.\n\n47:47.540 --> 47:51.500\n Like I know you moved to America at what age?\n\n47:51.500 --> 47:52.340\n 13.\n\n47:52.340 --> 47:53.160\n Okay.\n\n47:53.160 --> 47:55.100\n So, at least I don't know what it was for you,\n\n47:55.100 --> 47:57.600\n but in America at my age,\n\n47:57.600 --> 48:00.180\n you usually play like a sport every season, right?\n\n48:00.180 --> 48:02.600\n So, that's what I did in the beginning.\n\n48:02.600 --> 48:04.620\n I had minimal success in wrestling.\n\n48:04.620 --> 48:06.180\n I was kind of chunky.\n\n48:06.180 --> 48:09.020\n And then in fifth grade, I don't know.\n\n48:09.020 --> 48:11.380\n And I can't tell you, I wanted to be better.\n\n48:11.380 --> 48:12.980\n And I told my parents, and this is funny,\n\n48:12.980 --> 48:14.260\n because now I look at other 11 year olds\n\n48:14.260 --> 48:15.900\n and very few of them are this mature.\n\n48:15.900 --> 48:17.300\n And I actually think emotional maturity\n\n48:17.300 --> 48:18.540\n is kind of one of the key indicators\n\n48:18.540 --> 48:21.020\n of how longterm successful someone's gonna be.\n\n48:21.020 --> 48:23.100\n And at age 11, I said, I don't wanna play baseball.\n\n48:23.100 --> 48:24.580\n I like baseball, but I don't wanna play baseball\n\n48:24.580 --> 48:25.420\n because I wanna wrestle more\n\n48:25.420 --> 48:26.860\n because I wanna get better at wrestling.\n\n48:26.860 --> 48:28.460\n So, at age 11, I quit baseball\n\n48:28.460 --> 48:30.940\n so I could wrestle in a club for March, April, and May.\n\n48:30.940 --> 48:33.300\n Because that was all that existed at that point in time.\n\n48:33.300 --> 48:34.540\n You couldn't wrestle in June, July,\n\n48:34.540 --> 48:36.100\n or any of those other months.\n\n48:37.260 --> 48:38.780\n What was that desire to get better?\n\n48:38.780 --> 48:39.620\n What is that?\n\n48:39.620 --> 48:40.460\n So, it's not about winning.\n\n48:40.460 --> 48:41.380\n I don't know where it came from.\n\n48:41.380 --> 48:43.220\n I just wanted to get better.\n\n48:43.220 --> 48:44.060\n I wanna get better.\n\n48:44.060 --> 48:44.900\n I wanna be good at this.\n\n48:44.900 --> 48:45.740\n I wanna be really good at this.\n\n48:45.740 --> 48:47.940\n So, when you're looking at kids now as a coach,\n\n48:47.940 --> 48:49.100\n you're looking for that.\n\n48:49.100 --> 48:51.140\n Somebody who says, you know what, I kinda suck.\n\n48:51.140 --> 48:51.980\n I wanna get better.\n\n48:51.980 --> 48:54.340\n And I wanna try to also inspire that.\n\n48:54.340 --> 48:58.340\n I mean, honestly, I think as a coach,\n\n48:58.340 --> 49:01.800\n that's probably my biggest job is to get a kid\n\n49:01.800 --> 49:03.940\n and get them to believe I can do this.\n\n49:03.940 --> 49:07.340\n Because if I can do this, well, I can do that.\n\n49:07.340 --> 49:08.980\n I can do that too, right?\n\n49:08.980 --> 49:10.700\n And there's so many kids who, unfortunately,\n\n49:10.700 --> 49:14.140\n have shitty parents or bad teachers\n\n49:14.140 --> 49:16.740\n that tell them, you suck, you can't be anything, right?\n\n49:16.740 --> 49:18.740\n So, I think my biggest goal as a coach\n\n49:18.740 --> 49:20.260\n is to get someone to believe they can do it.\n\n49:20.260 --> 49:22.340\n So, actually, some of the ones that believe they can do it,\n\n49:22.340 --> 49:23.220\n they're the most fun,\n\n49:23.220 --> 49:25.420\n but they're not the ones who need it the most, right?\n\n49:25.420 --> 49:26.380\n The ones who think they can\n\n49:26.380 --> 49:28.420\n are the ones that need me the most.\n\n49:28.420 --> 49:30.460\n Because they need someone to, let's go.\n\n49:31.340 --> 49:33.400\n So, I don't know what inspired me.\n\n49:33.400 --> 49:34.240\n I'm not sure.\n\n49:34.240 --> 49:37.900\n At age 11, fifth grade, I quit.\n\n49:37.900 --> 49:40.620\n So, then I started having more success\n\n49:40.620 --> 49:43.820\n where I'm like, say, placing at the state tournament.\n\n49:43.820 --> 49:44.860\n In high school.\n\n49:44.860 --> 49:46.020\n So, you're right.\n\n49:46.020 --> 49:48.140\n So, sixth grade, I placed at the state,\n\n49:48.140 --> 49:49.620\n the local youth state tournament, you know?\n\n49:49.620 --> 49:51.940\n So, I'm having more success.\n\n49:51.940 --> 49:52.860\n Seventh grade was the first year\n\n49:52.860 --> 49:55.120\n I won the youth state tournament.\n\n49:55.120 --> 49:56.100\n So, I'm getting better.\n\n49:56.100 --> 49:58.140\n Eighth grade, I actually feel like I got pretty good,\n\n49:58.140 --> 50:00.100\n but when I went to the national tournaments,\n\n50:00.100 --> 50:02.200\n I was still having really minimal success.\n\n50:02.200 --> 50:04.880\n My freshman year, I decided to quit football.\n\n50:04.880 --> 50:05.720\n Same reason.\n\n50:05.720 --> 50:06.920\n It's like, well, I need to put more time into this.\n\n50:06.920 --> 50:10.040\n My parents, my dad luckily got a mat in my basement.\n\n50:10.040 --> 50:12.720\n So, we have a year round club,\n\n50:12.720 --> 50:15.080\n and our impetus was that we didn't have this opportunity\n\n50:15.080 --> 50:16.860\n to go to a club year round.\n\n50:16.860 --> 50:18.040\n So, we had a mat in my basement.\n\n50:18.040 --> 50:21.520\n I had to go find, hey, you wanna come wrestle?\n\n50:21.520 --> 50:22.840\n Yeah, to find partners for myself.\n\n50:22.840 --> 50:23.680\n What'd you do?\n\n50:23.680 --> 50:24.500\n Did you drill?\n\n50:24.500 --> 50:25.400\n Did you live wrestle?\n\n50:25.400 --> 50:26.720\n What'd you do in that basement?\n\n50:26.720 --> 50:28.600\n So, actually, I think, you'll enjoy this.\n\n50:28.600 --> 50:33.160\n I think the start of my scrambling was\n\n50:33.160 --> 50:34.440\n kind of based around that.\n\n50:34.440 --> 50:36.320\n So, I got kind of,\n\n50:36.320 --> 50:37.680\n I think it's probably my freshman sophomore.\n\n50:37.680 --> 50:39.920\n I'm kind of, the years are a little fuzzy, right?\n\n50:39.920 --> 50:41.360\n It's been a while.\n\n50:41.360 --> 50:45.160\n But probably my freshman, sophomore, junior year,\n\n50:45.160 --> 50:47.580\n I found two kids who were really consistent\n\n50:47.580 --> 50:49.080\n who would come out, like you would come out on,\n\n50:49.080 --> 50:50.000\n he would come out on Tuesday,\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:51.640\n and this dude would come out on a Wednesday, right?\n\n50:51.640 --> 50:52.640\n And they would come every week,\n\n50:52.640 --> 50:55.040\n and they were really consistent partners for me\n\n50:55.040 --> 50:56.340\n to have in the summer.\n\n50:56.340 --> 50:57.960\n But they weren't nearly as good as me.\n\n50:57.960 --> 50:58.880\n They were way worse.\n\n50:58.880 --> 51:02.320\n So, it's like, okay, how do I,\n\n51:02.320 --> 51:04.940\n how do I make this kind of like fun and compelling\n\n51:04.940 --> 51:05.780\n for them to come back?\n\n51:05.780 --> 51:07.040\n Because if I just whoop their ass,\n\n51:07.040 --> 51:08.920\n they're not gonna come back, you know?\n\n51:08.920 --> 51:11.320\n So, it was like, I would let them get as close as they could,\n\n51:11.320 --> 51:13.480\n and I thought they could do a takedown\n\n51:13.480 --> 51:14.640\n before not getting it,\n\n51:14.640 --> 51:16.960\n and then try to like escape or get out.\n\n51:16.960 --> 51:18.380\n So, obviously, if I let them get really close,\n\n51:18.380 --> 51:19.640\n sometimes they get it, you know?\n\n51:19.640 --> 51:21.480\n So, they're enjoying it.\n\n51:21.480 --> 51:23.560\n I don't know if they ever knew I was doing this, right?\n\n51:23.560 --> 51:24.460\n I have no idea.\n\n51:25.320 --> 51:26.640\n And that was kind of like the start,\n\n51:26.640 --> 51:28.920\n because I had to figure my way out of bad positions,\n\n51:28.920 --> 51:32.280\n because I had to try to make it entertaining for them,\n\n51:32.280 --> 51:33.480\n where they still got something out of it,\n\n51:33.480 --> 51:34.920\n and they wanted to come back the next week.\n\n51:34.920 --> 51:36.440\n And I also got something out of it.\n\n51:36.440 --> 51:37.720\n Yeah, I love this, yeah.\n\n51:37.720 --> 51:39.800\n Because that relationship is so important,\n\n51:39.800 --> 51:42.360\n with that, like, that,\n\n51:42.360 --> 51:44.480\n I've had a few drilling partners,\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:47.920\n training partners that were really important to my life,\n\n51:47.920 --> 51:50.680\n and I always wonder why it's difficult,\n\n51:50.680 --> 51:52.520\n why it's so difficult to find them.\n\n51:52.520 --> 51:53.360\n Yeah.\n\n51:53.360 --> 51:55.720\n Like I, if anyone's listening to this,\n\n51:55.720 --> 51:58.840\n I'm looking for a judo person in the Austin area, actually.\n\n51:58.840 --> 52:01.000\n Getting the reps with people is hard.\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:04.480\n Even in jiu jitsu, that,\n\n52:04.480 --> 52:06.520\n it's just like, people want to do the fun stuff.\n\n52:06.520 --> 52:08.440\n They don't want to really put in the work,\n\n52:08.440 --> 52:10.400\n and it takes a certain kind of personality.\n\n52:10.400 --> 52:13.920\n And then you also have to make it fun for the other person,\n\n52:13.920 --> 52:14.760\n just like you said.\n\n52:14.760 --> 52:16.000\n If there's a skill mismatch,\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:19.620\n but also if you have an interest mismatch,\n\n52:19.620 --> 52:22.360\n in terms of the amount of drilling you want to do,\n\n52:22.360 --> 52:23.180\n all that kind of stuff,\n\n52:23.180 --> 52:24.960\n you have to figure out ways to make it fun.\n\n52:24.960 --> 52:25.860\n It's tricky.\n\n52:25.860 --> 52:26.700\n So you did.\n\n52:26.700 --> 52:28.160\n So, yeah, I think I did that,\n\n52:28.160 --> 52:29.920\n and no one told me.\n\n52:29.920 --> 52:31.400\n As I get some, I get frustrated,\n\n52:31.400 --> 52:33.280\n because now we have, just in my academy,\n\n52:33.280 --> 52:36.440\n we probably have 50, 60 high school kids only\n\n52:36.440 --> 52:37.260\n that are year round.\n\n52:37.260 --> 52:38.200\n They're year round.\n\n52:38.200 --> 52:39.880\n Maybe they're not consistent in the summer or whatever,\n\n52:39.880 --> 52:40.720\n but they're there.\n\n52:40.720 --> 52:42.160\n So when they don't have a great partner,\n\n52:42.160 --> 52:43.000\n they start whining,\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.840\n and it's like, you little bitches, like, you know.\n\n52:45.840 --> 52:47.040\n Some days they get really mad about it,\n\n52:47.040 --> 52:48.240\n because it's like, I had no partners.\n\n52:48.240 --> 52:50.680\n I had to find freaking two partners to come twice a week.\n\n52:50.680 --> 52:53.040\n You guys, there's still 22 people in the room.\n\n52:53.040 --> 52:55.240\n I'm sorry there's not the perfect partner for you,\n\n52:55.240 --> 52:56.720\n but like, go work out with that dude.\n\n52:56.720 --> 52:57.560\n Yeah.\n\n52:57.560 --> 52:58.380\n You know?\n\n52:58.380 --> 52:59.220\n Yeah.\n\n52:59.220 --> 53:00.160\n So what was the switch, the change?\n\n53:00.160 --> 53:01.680\n Was it gradual, or?\n\n53:01.680 --> 53:02.520\n Gradual.\n\n53:02.520 --> 53:03.340\n Okay.\n\n53:03.340 --> 53:04.280\n Yeah, so I was in ninth grade.\n\n53:04.280 --> 53:07.360\n I quit football, because I wanted to get really serious.\n\n53:07.360 --> 53:08.200\n What position in football were you in?\n\n53:08.200 --> 53:10.440\n I was actually a nose tackle.\n\n53:10.440 --> 53:11.500\n But at that point, so, okay,\n\n53:11.500 --> 53:13.460\n so I was also, the other thing I kind of left out here,\n\n53:13.460 --> 53:15.680\n I was really fat growing up.\n\n53:15.680 --> 53:19.320\n In sixth grade, I also decided, okay, I'm really fat,\n\n53:19.320 --> 53:20.400\n and if I want to be a competitive wrestler,\n\n53:20.400 --> 53:21.940\n I shouldn't be fat, because weight matters.\n\n53:21.940 --> 53:25.280\n I went from 130 pounds to 100 pounds in sixth grade.\n\n53:25.280 --> 53:26.120\n Nice.\n\n53:26.120 --> 53:28.440\n So by the time I was a freshman, I was 119.\n\n53:28.440 --> 53:30.820\n So I still wasn't as heavy as I was in sixth grade.\n\n53:30.820 --> 53:31.760\n So I was pretty small, too,\n\n53:31.760 --> 53:33.800\n but I was also slow, unfortunately.\n\n53:33.800 --> 53:35.640\n So they put me a nose tackle.\n\n53:35.640 --> 53:38.340\n I liked the competitiveness, so I was decent at it.\n\n53:39.440 --> 53:41.160\n So that's where you wrestled, 119?\n\n53:41.160 --> 53:42.540\n My freshman year, yeah.\n\n53:42.540 --> 53:43.720\n Mm hmm.\n\n53:43.720 --> 53:46.020\n So yeah, so then I started having a lot of success\n\n53:46.020 --> 53:48.920\n state wise, but not nationally.\n\n53:48.920 --> 53:50.200\n It's my national success,\n\n53:50.200 --> 53:52.920\n didn't come to my junior year in high school.\n\n53:52.920 --> 53:55.080\n But yeah, I was grinding and getting better the whole time.\n\n53:55.080 --> 53:57.000\n And then senior year, I started having a lot of success\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.360\n nationally, and I got recruited.\n\n53:59.360 --> 54:01.760\n But then even when my freshman year of college,\n\n54:01.760 --> 54:04.200\n this is where I loved competing, I would go every weekend.\n\n54:04.200 --> 54:07.800\n Because I knew, if you take the emotions out of competition,\n\n54:08.940 --> 54:12.120\n all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them,\n\n54:12.120 --> 54:14.360\n and then figuring out what you need to work on.\n\n54:14.360 --> 54:16.720\n If we take all the emotion out of it, that's what it is.\n\n54:16.720 --> 54:19.040\n So I wrestled 50 matches as a redshirt freshman,\n\n54:19.040 --> 54:20.360\n which is incredibly rare.\n\n54:20.360 --> 54:21.720\n I had 10 losses.\n\n54:21.720 --> 54:24.920\n So it's not, and like to not so great guys, you know?\n\n54:24.920 --> 54:27.320\n So like my skill level still at that point\n\n54:27.320 --> 54:28.160\n was not that great.\n\n54:28.160 --> 54:29.200\n And then the next year I came out\n\n54:29.200 --> 54:30.200\n and I made it into the finals.\n\n54:30.200 --> 54:33.960\n So my, I made a gigantic jump in that redshirt year\n\n54:33.960 --> 54:35.920\n to the real freshman year.\n\n54:35.920 --> 54:37.840\n So a few questions.\n\n54:37.840 --> 54:40.880\n Where did the funk style of wrestling,\n\n54:40.880 --> 54:44.440\n the creative stuff get developed, at which stage?\n\n54:44.440 --> 54:47.040\n So I think like looking retroactively,\n\n54:47.040 --> 54:49.480\n there was no intention to start when I was in high school\n\n54:49.480 --> 54:51.940\n with those kids, but I think that's kind of like,\n\n54:51.940 --> 54:54.680\n well, what was happening, right?\n\n54:54.680 --> 54:56.380\n So what I would really say is,\n\n54:56.380 --> 54:59.200\n I had one influential coach my redshirt year of college\n\n54:59.200 --> 55:01.800\n named Mike Ironman, great guy.\n\n55:01.800 --> 55:04.260\n But then the second thing was, it was just out of necessity.\n\n55:04.260 --> 55:06.440\n I had this burning desire to be the best.\n\n55:06.440 --> 55:09.160\n And when I was getting my ass kicked every day in the room,\n\n55:09.160 --> 55:10.560\n cause we had, you know, Tyron was there,\n\n55:10.560 --> 55:13.360\n we had All American 157, we had All American 184.\n\n55:13.360 --> 55:15.980\n So I wasn't having a ton of success.\n\n55:15.980 --> 55:18.080\n And very quickly I realized\n\n55:18.080 --> 55:21.440\n from like a more traditional athletic perspective,\n\n55:21.440 --> 55:23.440\n strength and speed, I couldn't keep up with anyone.\n\n55:23.440 --> 55:25.060\n I was way worse.\n\n55:25.060 --> 55:27.220\n So it's like, okay, fuck, how do I, how do I do this?\n\n55:27.220 --> 55:28.240\n You know, I want to do this.\n\n55:28.240 --> 55:29.640\n How do I do this?\n\n55:29.640 --> 55:31.340\n There's gotta be a way, you know?\n\n55:31.340 --> 55:33.420\n So Mike Ironman showed me a couple of things,\n\n55:33.420 --> 55:36.480\n but then it was just like this creative expansion\n\n55:36.480 --> 55:39.800\n for the next, you know, say three to five years.\n\n55:39.800 --> 55:42.600\n And then even now it's like, I don't know,\n\n55:42.600 --> 55:44.640\n there's something, and maybe you feel this way about judo,\n\n55:44.640 --> 55:47.440\n or there's something that's like fun\n\n55:47.440 --> 55:49.720\n about the way the body moves and works\n\n55:49.720 --> 55:52.680\n and exploring something new and thinking about,\n\n55:52.680 --> 55:55.280\n hey, wrestling's been happening at a relatively high level\n\n55:55.280 --> 55:57.780\n for we'll say 80 to 90 years in America.\n\n55:59.120 --> 56:01.360\n And there's still new things being developed.\n\n56:01.360 --> 56:02.480\n And so when you see something new,\n\n56:02.480 --> 56:03.880\n you're like, oh damn, like, that's great.\n\n56:03.880 --> 56:05.720\n Or like Jason Knowles may have to win Dixie.\n\n56:05.720 --> 56:07.400\n I'm like, how did I not think of that shit?\n\n56:07.400 --> 56:08.320\n Like, why did I think of that?\n\n56:08.320 --> 56:11.240\n So easy, I should have thought of that, you know?\n\n56:11.240 --> 56:14.880\n So there's this like obsession with the sport of wrestling\n\n56:14.880 --> 56:19.640\n and positions where I actually think sometimes,\n\n56:19.640 --> 56:20.760\n thank God we didn't have smartphones\n\n56:20.760 --> 56:23.360\n because I may have been distracted by my smartphone.\n\n56:23.360 --> 56:24.800\n Maybe I wouldn't have been because I was so obsessed,\n\n56:24.800 --> 56:27.360\n but maybe, but you know, some days I had,\n\n56:27.360 --> 56:29.620\n couldn't finish the single leg on a specific person\n\n56:29.620 --> 56:32.680\n or maybe they were finishing on me and it was like,\n\n56:32.680 --> 56:34.340\n go home and I was just fucking obsessed\n\n56:34.340 --> 56:35.880\n about that one position.\n\n56:35.880 --> 56:38.760\n Like, okay, what am I missing here?\n\n56:38.760 --> 56:41.560\n And not just accepting like that whatever the coach says\n\n56:41.560 --> 56:43.880\n is the answer, but like, what am I missing?\n\n56:43.880 --> 56:45.640\n What ways can my body move\n\n56:45.640 --> 56:48.440\n that no one's told me it can move yet?\n\n56:48.440 --> 56:50.280\n Where can my arms go, right?\n\n56:50.280 --> 56:51.360\n Where can I do all these things?\n\n56:51.360 --> 56:53.800\n And so I would just obsess about these things.\n\n56:53.800 --> 56:55.480\n And then, you know, sometimes you come in the next day\n\n56:55.480 --> 56:57.700\n and you say, oh, well maybe this, you know,\n\n56:57.700 --> 56:59.360\n and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't,\n\n56:59.360 --> 57:01.040\n maybe it works twice and it doesn't work the next time.\n\n57:01.040 --> 57:03.160\n And so you kind of like have this creative process\n\n57:03.160 --> 57:05.000\n and it's like, you know, there's a lot of things\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:06.000\n that are on the cutting room floor\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:07.660\n that never made it to the light\n\n57:07.660 --> 57:08.920\n because you thought they'd be good\n\n57:08.920 --> 57:10.360\n and they failed and they sucked.\n\n57:10.360 --> 57:11.720\n And then, you know, to the point where,\n\n57:11.720 --> 57:12.940\n like my senior year,\n\n57:14.920 --> 57:16.760\n I got to this point where the people,\n\n57:16.760 --> 57:18.260\n then they were just figures.\n\n57:18.260 --> 57:19.860\n Figures would wrestle in my head\n\n57:19.860 --> 57:21.280\n about positions I was thinking about.\n\n57:21.280 --> 57:22.460\n I wouldn't tell them what to do.\n\n57:22.460 --> 57:24.460\n They would just, they'd just go in my head.\n\n57:24.460 --> 57:27.600\n And then like, oh fuck, wait, that's it.\n\n57:27.600 --> 57:29.040\n That's it, like that just happened.\n\n57:29.040 --> 57:30.640\n That's the move and then I'd go try to practice\n\n57:30.640 --> 57:32.680\n and sure enough, boom, that's the move.\n\n57:32.680 --> 57:34.700\n That's exactly what you have Alpha Zero playing,\n\n57:34.700 --> 57:35.540\n learning chess.\n\n57:35.540 --> 57:38.880\n You have, it's called Self Plays.\n\n57:38.880 --> 57:43.400\n You have, did the figures have like a clear?\n\n57:43.400 --> 57:45.140\n No faces, they were just like.\n\n57:45.140 --> 57:46.600\n Did they have a human form\n\n57:46.600 --> 57:48.720\n or is it just like stick figures essentially?\n\n57:48.720 --> 57:50.920\n Yeah, it was not like humans.\n\n57:50.920 --> 57:51.880\n It was more like stick figures.\n\n57:51.880 --> 57:55.000\n They weren't stick figures exactly like they were.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:56.200\n They had some volume?\n\n57:56.200 --> 57:58.040\n Yeah, it was like a gray person\n\n57:58.040 --> 58:00.560\n and they had, you know, three dimensions essentially\n\n58:00.560 --> 58:05.560\n so I had to see how the things moved and yeah.\n\n58:05.880 --> 58:09.720\n I mean, this is exactly what OpenAI and DeepMind at Google\n\n58:09.720 --> 58:12.540\n are, I don't know if you've seen,\n\n58:12.540 --> 58:14.440\n but there's something called reinforcement learning\n\n58:14.440 --> 58:17.200\n in artificial intelligence where you have like,\n\n58:17.200 --> 58:19.180\n they've done it for like sumo wrestling.\n\n58:19.180 --> 58:23.080\n You have like, you have these two stick figures\n\n58:23.080 --> 58:26.200\n that don't even know how to get up at first\n\n58:26.200 --> 58:28.680\n and they figure out how to stand on their two feet\n\n58:28.680 --> 58:31.160\n and then they figure out how to push the other person\n\n58:31.160 --> 58:33.440\n off of the pedestal.\n\n58:33.440 --> 58:36.040\n Wait, so, but what about like when you look\n\n58:36.040 --> 58:38.840\n at the Boston Dynamics, sometimes they have trouble\n\n58:38.840 --> 58:41.560\n with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff.\n\n58:41.560 --> 58:43.720\n So are they doing that same program or no?\n\n58:43.720 --> 58:44.560\n No, no, no, no.\n\n58:44.560 --> 58:49.560\n This, everything Boston Dynamics is doing is hard coded\n\n58:50.420 --> 58:53.900\n so it's not learning the,\n\n58:55.160 --> 58:57.440\n all of the sophisticated movements and strategies\n\n58:57.440 --> 58:58.960\n like high level strategies and movement,\n\n58:58.960 --> 59:02.040\n that's all something that Boston Dynamics does not do\n\n59:02.040 --> 59:03.880\n and if it does it, like the parkour stuff,\n\n59:03.880 --> 59:05.040\n that's all hard coded in.\n\n59:05.040 --> 59:06.440\n Oh, interesting.\n\n59:06.440 --> 59:10.240\n People like project and think like these robots\n\n59:10.240 --> 59:13.020\n have like discovered like how to move\n\n59:13.020 --> 59:14.720\n in sophisticated ways they haven't.\n\n59:14.720 --> 59:17.200\n Well, that's what, when you and John were talking\n\n59:17.200 --> 59:19.720\n about the grappling robot.\n\n59:19.720 --> 59:20.540\n Yeah.\n\n59:20.540 --> 59:24.060\n I mean, the one thing I was obsessing about in my head\n\n59:24.060 --> 59:26.960\n is that with the chess, right?\n\n59:26.960 --> 59:28.660\n If a chess piece moves, right?\n\n59:28.660 --> 59:31.420\n The horse can move like an L, right?\n\n59:31.420 --> 59:32.600\n It can only move like an L.\n\n59:32.600 --> 59:35.120\n It doesn't matter if it moves at two meters per second\n\n59:35.120 --> 59:36.720\n or seven meters per second.\n\n59:36.720 --> 59:38.720\n It can only move there, right?\n\n59:38.720 --> 59:41.520\n Whereas like a single leg, I can shoot a single leg\n\n59:41.520 --> 59:43.680\n with many different velocities.\n\n59:43.680 --> 59:45.260\n I can shoot at different angles.\n\n59:45.260 --> 59:48.160\n I can shoot with different amounts of force, right?\n\n59:48.160 --> 59:50.200\n I can shoot with my head up versus my head,\n\n59:50.200 --> 59:51.020\n I mean, right?\n\n59:51.020 --> 59:52.200\n All these things are gonna matter.\n\n59:52.200 --> 59:55.400\n We're talking about a human being defending the single leg.\n\n59:55.400 --> 59:56.900\n All of those things are gonna matter\n\n59:56.900 --> 1:00:00.120\n and that's where human beings who wrestle\n\n1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:01.880\n are calculating those things subconsciously.\n\n1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:04.700\n They're obviously not consciously calculating in their head,\n\n1:00:04.700 --> 1:00:06.600\n oh, the force is coming at me at this,\n\n1:00:06.600 --> 1:00:07.640\n so I need to do that, right?\n\n1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:09.360\n They're just doing it because.\n\n1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:12.160\n But see, the thing is, so you would absolutely,\n\n1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:14.120\n if you're doing a robot that you're wrestling,\n\n1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:16.680\n you're going to have to constrain the speed at which it moves\n\n1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:19.160\n and the power that it's able to deliver.\n\n1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:22.400\n So that presumably, that'll be the limitation.\n\n1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:24.920\n So then it'll be just the same exactly as a human.\n\n1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:28.440\n But then, so if we go human, max force,\n\n1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:30.480\n we're Jordan Burrows double, max force, right?\n\n1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:31.840\n That's the highest, that's the highest we get\n\n1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:33.400\n and then we go down from there.\n\n1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:38.120\n Even within that, it's like sometimes,\n\n1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:40.200\n I can shoot a single leg with a maximum force of,\n\n1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:43.240\n I don't know, we'll just say 20 is the number, right?\n\n1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:44.800\n I don't know, I'll shoot it at 20\n\n1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:46.640\n because I feel sometimes I shoot it at 15,\n\n1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:48.600\n sometimes I shoot it at 12, right?\n\n1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:50.880\n Because you feel something in your opponent\n\n1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:52.320\n that makes you do it differently.\n\n1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:53.800\n So they would have to learn how,\n\n1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:55.640\n and then all of these different things\n\n1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:57.920\n and sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder.\n\n1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:00.520\n So the robot would have to learn\n\n1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:03.400\n all of these different incoming inputs to the system\n\n1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:04.880\n and then create this reaction.\n\n1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:06.160\n Oh no, no, no, 100%.\n\n1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:08.360\n So this would be all continuous.\n\n1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:09.600\n So unlike chess, it would not be,\n\n1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:11.800\n it's just chess is discrete, there's, it's.\n\n1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:12.760\n One and then.\n\n1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:16.340\n You move, it's a very specific set of moves.\n\n1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:19.160\n Now here you would, those are all variables you control\n\n1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:20.440\n and they're continuous variables.\n\n1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:23.480\n So the speed, the force, there's actuators,\n\n1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:24.960\n so there's all these joints, right?\n\n1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:25.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:26.640\n But you can move.\n\n1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.600\n I mean, it's just an optimization problem.\n\n1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:30.240\n It's kind of, and it's fascinating.\n\n1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:31.600\n So I've been fascinated thinking about it\n\n1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.440\n since you guys talked about it.\n\n1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:34.280\n It was a long time ago,\n\n1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:36.160\n I listened to it probably three to four weeks ago\n\n1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:39.560\n and I've kind of been like obsessing about it ever since.\n\n1:01:39.560 --> 1:01:42.220\n Yeah, it just changes when,\n\n1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:45.800\n so unlike boxing, for example, or striking,\n\n1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.480\n once you grab a hold of somebody,\n\n1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:52.320\n it changes, you're now one body, right?\n\n1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:53.720\n So it's very complicated.\n\n1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.600\n It's not just shooting a double leg without,\n\n1:01:56.600 --> 1:02:00.140\n like maybe doing like faking a double leg\n\n1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:01.760\n and then shooting the double leg,\n\n1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:03.640\n that's very doable with robotics,\n\n1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:07.600\n but then like doing a clinch and from there,\n\n1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:09.920\n doing like a Russian tie, like that,\n\n1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:14.400\n that's, I think that's way harder than people realize\n\n1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:17.240\n in terms of how many things are involved,\n\n1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:20.440\n like the force of the grip, the leverage you're providing\n\n1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:22.120\n with all the different parts of the shoulder\n\n1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:24.760\n and the arm and the torso, the twist,\n\n1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:26.760\n how much of your weight are you allocating,\n\n1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:28.800\n like leaning on the other person,\n\n1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:30.520\n like taking weight off of one of your legs\n\n1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.400\n and the other leg, all of that.\n\n1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:35.400\n I think that's the really interesting thing about humans\n\n1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:38.120\n is we're able to do all of this calculation.\n\n1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:40.400\n Subconsciously. Yeah, subconsciously.\n\n1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:41.960\n Yeah, and that's what I've been thinking about since we,\n\n1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:45.680\n it's like how many things even these high school athletes\n\n1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:47.960\n who are like getting medium good\n\n1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:50.520\n are subconsciously thinking about all the time\n\n1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:53.120\n or not even thinking about, sorry, reacting to,\n\n1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.320\n but then even like for me, I'm a few orders of magnitude\n\n1:02:57.320 --> 1:02:58.520\n better than some of these kids that play,\n\n1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:00.320\n and so when I go like super hard,\n\n1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:02.480\n it's like I can feel their weight\n\n1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:03.640\n moving the wrong direction,\n\n1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:05.920\n and so for me to off balance them or trip them or whatever\n\n1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:07.680\n is kind of easy sometimes, you know,\n\n1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:11.520\n because they're not feeling it the right way, right,\n\n1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:13.600\n or their timing's just a little bit off\n\n1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:15.160\n or the way they're grabbing the hip,\n\n1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:16.720\n maybe they should be up a little higher, right,\n\n1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.560\n these really small things.\n\n1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.080\n Yeah, I think that's all easy to take advantage of\n\n1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:24.720\n for a robot, it's just there's so many things.\n\n1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:28.000\n The big problem is ethically,\n\n1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:30.640\n I don't know how many people are willing to train\n\n1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.800\n with a robot because you're gonna get hurt.\n\n1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:36.080\n Well, couldn't you make a robot train as a robot or no?\n\n1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:37.960\n Yes, but then it's expensive.\n\n1:03:38.840 --> 1:03:40.520\n So, because they're gonna get.\n\n1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:42.040\n Put the padding on that thing.\n\n1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:45.680\n I know, but then it's not, you know,\n\n1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:50.680\n it's, then you're not capturing the full.\n\n1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:53.160\n Why can't you put like some rubber coating on them,\n\n1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:54.880\n you know, something for that effect?\n\n1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:58.320\n You could, I mean, you could, you could.\n\n1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:01.200\n I mean, you're talking about robots that are,\n\n1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:02.680\n these are humanoid robots,\n\n1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:07.320\n so we're talking about $500,000 million robots.\n\n1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:12.320\n So, you would have to be motivated to spend a lot of money\n\n1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:17.320\n because you have to have them wrestle for like a lot.\n\n1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:20.200\n To get better.\n\n1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:21.200\n Yeah, to get better.\n\n1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:26.200\n And then, the open question is how long does it take\n\n1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:29.300\n to get good enough to be a human?\n\n1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:34.520\n I don't think we understand, I don't know,\n\n1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:37.680\n I don't think you understand how hard wrestling is.\n\n1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:38.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:39.840\n Like, is it a really hard problem?\n\n1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:41.440\n Like, what's harder, chess or wrestling?\n\n1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:42.640\n Wrestling, by far.\n\n1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:43.480\n Not even close.\n\n1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.600\n That's, yeah, that's the sense I have.\n\n1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:48.560\n So, because there's an infinite amount of moves, right?\n\n1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:50.720\n And possibilities, so once I shoot the same leg,\n\n1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.960\n now you have X amount of choices.\n\n1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:54.840\n Once you make your choice, now I have a choice,\n\n1:04:54.840 --> 1:04:56.040\n X amount of choices.\n\n1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:58.180\n Now you have X amount of choices on the defense,\n\n1:04:58.180 --> 1:04:59.760\n and we can just keep going back and forth, right?\n\n1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:01.300\n And this number becomes.\n\n1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:02.760\n Yeah, but the same happens with chess.\n\n1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:04.160\n Correct, but then in wrestling,\n\n1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:08.100\n you have to make these movements very instantaneously,\n\n1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:09.040\n right, because if I shoot a single leg,\n\n1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:11.000\n I'm not gonna wait and say, what's your defense?\n\n1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:11.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:12.660\n Right, you have to be instantaneously.\n\n1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:15.320\n And then, also, again, based on the force and the vectors\n\n1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:19.160\n and the angles, you have to calculate that and adjust.\n\n1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:20.880\n So really, you know, if you're saying,\n\n1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:21.900\n well, I can shoot a single leg,\n\n1:05:21.900 --> 1:05:24.800\n it's not like moving the chess, it's not one move, right?\n\n1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:27.120\n If you want to talk about different forces and stuff,\n\n1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:29.140\n it could be hundreds or thousands of different moves\n\n1:05:29.140 --> 1:05:30.600\n based on how hard I shoot it,\n\n1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:32.440\n the angle, the direction, all of those things.\n\n1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:33.360\n Yeah, but wait a minute.\n\n1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:35.880\n So, robots can do this kind of stuff really fast.\n\n1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:38.880\n People probably know the physiology of this,\n\n1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:41.720\n but the reaction speed for a human\n\n1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:44.160\n is maybe 100 milliseconds, something like that, I don't know,\n\n1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:49.160\n from sensation to, like, from the signal traveling\n\n1:05:49.340 --> 1:05:52.160\n up to your brain and down, I don't know what that number is,\n\n1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:56.340\n but robots certainly could do it way faster.\n\n1:05:56.340 --> 1:06:00.000\n You would actually have to, like, constrain the speed.\n\n1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.720\n Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people,\n\n1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:04.840\n right, so, yeah, theoretically,\n\n1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:06.280\n they could eventually beat wrestlers,\n\n1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:08.680\n but you asked what was harder, wrestling or chess.\n\n1:06:08.680 --> 1:06:10.200\n Yeah, and I think wrestling is,\n\n1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:12.240\n because of the time component in it\n\n1:06:12.240 --> 1:06:15.880\n and the physicality of, you know,\n\n1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:18.120\n is it this force or that force, you know?\n\n1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:20.800\n Because if I'm gonna say we're in a seatbelt side by side,\n\n1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:23.000\n right, a wrestling seatbelt, not in Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:25.960\n based on the pressure you're giving me,\n\n1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.520\n I might do a bunch of different things, right?\n\n1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:29.580\n And so, like, to an untrained eye,\n\n1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:32.980\n they might both look like the same thing from you.\n\n1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:35.720\n To a trained feel, it's like, well, in one case,\n\n1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:37.080\n it's really evident I should go this way,\n\n1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.240\n in another case, it's really evident I should go that way.\n\n1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:43.080\n So the other thing to consider, just like with chess,\n\n1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:47.360\n the AI systems, so human versus human\n\n1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:49.000\n play a certain way together.\n\n1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.240\n They actually haven't considered\n\n1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:52.940\n a really large number of strategies\n\n1:06:52.940 --> 1:06:54.400\n that AI systems discover.\n\n1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:55.960\n So one possibility with a robot,\n\n1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:58.680\n they'll discover certain ties and certain takedowns.\n\n1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:00.000\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.120\n That, like, will dominate no matter what the human does.\n\n1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:04.580\n You think that, so you think there's that,\n\n1:07:04.580 --> 1:07:06.280\n so this, I mean, this is what I'm talking about\n\n1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:07.920\n with the wrestling, so fun is there's,\n\n1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:11.720\n even after 80, 90 years, there's this continuous evolution.\n\n1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:12.560\n So you think.\n\n1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:13.800\n There'll be some, like, low single type thing,\n\n1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:15.840\n like John Smith type of situation.\n\n1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:17.520\n Well, like a down block go behind is something\n\n1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:20.560\n that has really, I would say really in the last fiveish years\n\n1:07:20.560 --> 1:07:21.720\n has really been evolved.\n\n1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:22.620\n What's a go behind?\n\n1:07:22.620 --> 1:07:24.600\n Down block go behind, so when you shoot,\n\n1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.040\n well, they just, head inside or head outside matters,\n\n1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:28.400\n but there's one for both.\n\n1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:31.160\n You shoot at me, essentially, I take my leg, boom.\n\n1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:33.320\n And then, so that was kind of in existence\n\n1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:34.320\n when I was in college, right?\n\n1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:35.600\n You down block them and you stop,\n\n1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:38.120\n but usually you hit on this side of their head, right?\n\n1:07:38.120 --> 1:07:40.480\n And now, immediately, you shoot and I attack that shoulder\n\n1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:43.160\n and then I start hitting a go behind on you, right?\n\n1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:47.080\n And so, like, that in its current incarnation,\n\n1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.080\n it absolutely wasn't around when I was in college.\n\n1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:51.840\n I would say it probably became popular\n\n1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:53.060\n five to seven years ago.\n\n1:07:53.060 --> 1:07:56.320\n So yeah, there's these big things that are happening.\n\n1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:57.400\n Now I really wanna roll back\n\n1:07:57.400 --> 1:07:58.560\n because I wanna be ahead of the game.\n\n1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:00.360\n I wanna know what I'm missing.\n\n1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:02.760\n I mean, one interesting thing you have with Alpha Zero\n\n1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:07.760\n that plays chess is it sacrifices pieces\n\n1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:09.480\n much more than humans do.\n\n1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:11.080\n So it'll give you a piece.\n\n1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:12.800\n And not only does it give you a piece,\n\n1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:17.800\n it will wait a bunch of moves before it makes you pay.\n\n1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:19.160\n So.\n\n1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:21.120\n Because it knows that that's better for the long term.\n\n1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:21.960\n Long term.\n\n1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:23.680\n So like humans rarely sacrifice\n\n1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:25.880\n without getting the piece back,\n\n1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:28.560\n like two or three moves after.\n\n1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:31.280\n Alpha Zero can wait like five moves.\n\n1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:35.520\n So basically you'll have, potentially with wrestling,\n\n1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:38.440\n you might have a robot that like puts itself\n\n1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:40.840\n in bad positions, but in a certain kind of way\n\n1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:42.680\n then that will actually turn out.\n\n1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:45.080\n Lures the opponent in to trap.\n\n1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:45.920\n Exactly.\n\n1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:46.760\n That's what my style is based on.\n\n1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:47.580\n Exactly.\n\n1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:50.880\n You basically narrow, one thing to do\n\n1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:52.460\n is you narrow the set of choices.\n\n1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:53.880\n You put yourself in a bad position,\n\n1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:55.200\n but it narrows the set of choices.\n\n1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:56.400\n For them, because they're not used to it.\n\n1:08:56.400 --> 1:08:58.120\n Yeah, they're not used to it.\n\n1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:02.320\n And then you drag them into your, yeah.\n\n1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:05.280\n So, but there's also, the problem is\n\n1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:06.880\n there's mechanical issues.\n\n1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:09.040\n Like it's actually just difficult to build robots\n\n1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:11.320\n that are able to sense,\n\n1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:14.360\n because we have sensation throughout our body, yeah.\n\n1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:16.020\n It's just difficult to build that kind of robot.\n\n1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:16.860\n It's expensive.\n\n1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:19.600\n You start talking about multimillion dollars,\n\n1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:21.820\n and then people start asking you questions.\n\n1:09:21.820 --> 1:09:23.560\n Why did you invest all of this money?\n\n1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:26.920\n They wanna see what moves they do, duh, hello.\n\n1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:28.360\n It could be a better investment.\n\n1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:29.680\n Okay.\n\n1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:31.100\n So I mentioned John Smith.\n\n1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.360\n He is, if people don't know,\n\n1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:36.320\n one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever.\n\n1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:37.920\n He's also creative like you.\n\n1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:39.680\n He spoke really highly of you.\n\n1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:40.720\n What do you think about that guy?\n\n1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:42.200\n Did you guys ever work together?\n\n1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:43.160\n Not really.\n\n1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:45.000\n So you know what, when I was a senior,\n\n1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000\n and I had the people wrestling in my head,\n\n1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.840\n I was lucky enough to be doing,\n\n1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:51.720\n I was pretty much a graduate,\n\n1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:53.760\n so I did an independent study with the sports psychology.\n\n1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:55.680\n I was potentially going to go to grad school\n\n1:09:55.680 --> 1:09:56.520\n for sports psychology.\n\n1:09:56.520 --> 1:09:57.680\n Well, I actually did nine credits,\n\n1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:00.440\n and then I just decided I didn't want to do it anymore.\n\n1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:02.880\n I continued learning on my own.\n\n1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:05.200\n But I had an independent study with the guy\n\n1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:07.800\n who's the head of USA Track and Field Sports Psych.\n\n1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:09.480\n So here was the class was,\n\n1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:11.520\n I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour,\n\n1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:13.320\n and he was like fascinated by me.\n\n1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:14.900\n So he didn't let me do homework.\n\n1:10:14.900 --> 1:10:16.480\n It was like the greatest three credits ever.\n\n1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:17.340\n We just talked.\n\n1:10:17.340 --> 1:10:18.180\n I learned so much.\n\n1:10:18.180 --> 1:10:19.200\n It was so awesome.\n\n1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:22.480\n But so I started, so one time it came up,\n\n1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:24.920\n I had these robot, or people wrestling in my head,\n\n1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:26.800\n and he said, well, who else do you think,\n\n1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:27.820\n but John Smith happened.\n\n1:10:27.820 --> 1:10:29.080\n So I went and got John Smith's number,\n\n1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:29.920\n and I called him and said,\n\n1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:32.520\n hey, you ever had these people wrestling in your head?\n\n1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:34.680\n And he said, yeah, but as soon as I stopped coaching,\n\n1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:35.640\n they went away.\n\n1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:36.920\n Same thing happened to me.\n\n1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:38.680\n As soon as I started coaching, they went away.\n\n1:10:38.680 --> 1:10:40.540\n So if I really force myself now,\n\n1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:43.160\n and I'm like, I see something in practice,\n\n1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:44.200\n and it's really higher level,\n\n1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:45.240\n because high school wrestling,\n\n1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:46.560\n I don't want to, maybe I feel bad,\n\n1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:48.400\n but it's a little bit lower level, right?\n\n1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:50.560\n So if Keegan, for example, who won the tournament,\n\n1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:54.040\n if he's struggling with a problem or asks me a question,\n\n1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:57.640\n and I can force myself to see the bodies moving\n\n1:10:57.640 --> 1:10:58.960\n and think about it again,\n\n1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:00.380\n kind of like I was in early age,\n\n1:11:00.380 --> 1:11:02.840\n but it won't just flow there anymore.\n\n1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:05.560\n So he said it went away, and for me, it went away also.\n\n1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:11.440\n By the way, if we can pause on the bodies in your head,\n\n1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:16.620\n how are they generating new ideas?\n\n1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:18.000\n Are they just kind of?\n\n1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.160\n I don't know.\n\n1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:20.240\n You tell me.\n\n1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:24.000\n So it's just, they're just scrambling in your head?\n\n1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.000\n It would be specifically based on a problem\n\n1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.280\n I was struggling with, or a specific position, you know?\n\n1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:32.800\n It goes in for a single, and then go from there.\n\n1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:34.940\n Yeah, so I'm sitting in geography class,\n\n1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:38.240\n and I don't have to work that hard, because it's easy, right?\n\n1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:40.720\n And yeah, I'm just sitting there acting\n\n1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:41.760\n like I'm looking at the board,\n\n1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:42.760\n and these guys are wrestling,\n\n1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:43.960\n and I'm watching them wrestle,\n\n1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:47.980\n and yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution.\n\n1:11:47.980 --> 1:11:52.360\n Is there somebody you look up to style wise?\n\n1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:57.200\n Like Gable, John Smith, all these legend status people.\n\n1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.560\n Probably Gable, or it's a Gable.\n\n1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:01.040\n John Smith, but after the fact.\n\n1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:03.380\n So the problem with wrestling in my era\n\n1:12:03.380 --> 1:12:04.760\n was you couldn't watch it.\n\n1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:06.240\n There was no access, right?\n\n1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:07.560\n It wasn't really available.\n\n1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:10.560\n Even if you want to say, go find a bunch of John Smith,\n\n1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:11.740\n man, they're kind of hard to find, right?\n\n1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:13.080\n There's a couple of them on YouTube,\n\n1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.040\n but I've obviously seen all of those,\n\n1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:18.080\n but in my era, there really wasn't any of it.\n\n1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:19.560\n So it was hard to be a fan of something,\n\n1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:23.200\n and that's why wrestling has, the fans are going like this,\n\n1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:25.740\n because now you can flip on the Flow app,\n\n1:12:25.740 --> 1:12:29.340\n and you can watch something that's happening in Europe, right?\n\n1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:32.640\n We can do this easily, so we can be a fan of people.\n\n1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:35.420\n So now I'm more a fan of wrestling than I was then,\n\n1:12:35.420 --> 1:12:37.560\n because there just was no access.\n\n1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:39.040\n So now I can watch someone I like,\n\n1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:41.080\n and say, oh shit, that guy's wrestling.\n\n1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:43.600\n Oh, boom, I flip my phone on, I watch them wrestle.\n\n1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:44.440\n That type of thing.\n\n1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:47.000\n You know, and a quick rant.\n\n1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.600\n It's really frustrating that you can't watch the Olympics.\n\n1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.680\n Oh my god, it's so frustrating.\n\n1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:55.920\n I've been, I think I'm gonna go to war on this point.\n\n1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:57.760\n Go to NBC's headquarters, I'll go with you.\n\n1:12:57.760 --> 1:12:59.720\n You got a soldier here.\n\n1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:02.480\n I was talking to Jimmy, Jimmy Pedro,\n\n1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:04.000\n he was surprised by this, too.\n\n1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.680\n Most matches, you can't see, even,\n\n1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:10.640\n you talk about like a comeback, Gable Steelers,\n\n1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:13.760\n and you can't see the full match.\n\n1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:15.840\n You get like a crappy highlight.\n\n1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:19.600\n So the two biggest things, and really the three,\n\n1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:21.280\n the NCAA championships on ESPN,\n\n1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:25.080\n the Olympic trials are on NBC, and the Olympics are on NBC.\n\n1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:27.400\n And these companies are so big,\n\n1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:28.880\n they don't have a department dedicated\n\n1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:31.960\n to selling the rights to that footage, right?\n\n1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:34.120\n So the rights to wrestling footage,\n\n1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:35.560\n which no one really cares all that much about,\n\n1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:38.600\n except a niche, are the exact same as track and field,\n\n1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:40.860\n or basketball in the Olympics.\n\n1:13:40.860 --> 1:13:44.600\n So yes, all of this stuff is completely inaccessible to us.\n\n1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:47.200\n The NCAAs, the Olympic trials, and the Olympics,\n\n1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.520\n you can't go watch old film on it, it sucks.\n\n1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:50.360\n So yeah.\n\n1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:51.200\n Yeah, old, the current film.\n\n1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:52.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.600\n So you can't even watch the Gable match?\n\n1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:55.680\n The Gable Steelers, no.\n\n1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:57.440\n They did a, you know, they do something\n\n1:13:57.440 --> 1:13:58.960\n that annoys the fuck out of me.\n\n1:13:58.960 --> 1:13:59.800\n What?\n\n1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:04.480\n Okay, they do like a three or two minute highlight.\n\n1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:09.000\n So it's like they capture the most important thing,\n\n1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.840\n but it's all about the buildup.\n\n1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:12.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:15.800\n It's like that very beginning when you step on the mat,\n\n1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:19.280\n and the nerves, and you walk out, and like that,\n\n1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:22.720\n I mean, I don't know, you miss,\n\n1:14:22.720 --> 1:14:26.720\n then when the triumph happens, or the heartbreak happens,\n\n1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:28.600\n it has that much more power.\n\n1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:30.800\n Yeah, if you want to go to war with NBC or ESPN,\n\n1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:32.120\n I'm happy to join that.\n\n1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:34.960\n I think I'm fortunate it's the IOC.\n\n1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:37.600\n Well, I mean, is the IOC on that?\n\n1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:40.240\n IOC is selling, for the Olympics,\n\n1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:41.920\n is the one that's making.\n\n1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:43.560\n Well, so NBC broadcasts,\n\n1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:45.600\n so they obviously have the live rights.\n\n1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:47.400\n You would think they would have recorded,\n\n1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:48.880\n if they, I mean, they're the ones recording it,\n\n1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:50.640\n you would think they keep the rights when you think.\n\n1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.680\n No, no, no, they're getting a license of it.\n\n1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:55.440\n They're getting exclusive like license,\n\n1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:57.640\n but like the, you know, for example,\n\n1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:02.520\n I've had this, I talked to Travis Stevens, the Judo player,\n\n1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:06.720\n and there's a really sort of famous match,\n\n1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:11.600\n just a heartbreak in his career from 2012 Olympics,\n\n1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:14.360\n where he goes against a German, Oli Bischoff, whatever.\n\n1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:16.600\n It's a 20 minute match to go to war,\n\n1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:18.320\n and that's not available anywhere,\n\n1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:22.800\n but it's uploaded on YouTube and set to private.\n\n1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:26.200\n The reason I know this is on the IOC channel.\n\n1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:28.400\n So they've uploaded all of these matches.\n\n1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:29.800\n They have it and put it up.\n\n1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:33.200\n So actually, so my Olympic match, the one I won,\n\n1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:37.040\n got put public, and so I don't know if it was private,\n\n1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:39.120\n it got put up on YouTube.\n\n1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:42.040\n I was allergic to it the week of my Jake Paul fight.\n\n1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:42.880\n It was so dumb.\n\n1:15:42.880 --> 1:15:46.400\n I'm like, why, this is 13 years later, this is bullshit.\n\n1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:47.800\n Like this should have been up.\n\n1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:51.600\n So, I mean, okay, so what about Olympic trials footage?\n\n1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:54.080\n That has to be the USOC then or NBC?\n\n1:15:55.720 --> 1:15:57.280\n So I know like, okay, so I know Flow, right?\n\n1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:58.280\n Cause I worked with them.\n\n1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:01.880\n I know if Flow buys your event or whatever, right?\n\n1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:04.520\n They buy the rights, generally in the contract,\n\n1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:06.400\n they'll have rights to both live stream it\n\n1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:09.400\n and then use that footage at any point moving forward.\n\n1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:12.760\n So those matches live on Flow's website.\n\n1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:13.920\n That's why I would be surprised\n\n1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:16.880\n if NBC didn't have something similar.\n\n1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:19.000\n Flow does a pretty good job of providing\n\n1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.080\n like a place where you can watch all these matches.\n\n1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:23.000\n NBC does not.\n\n1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:23.840\n Does not, yeah.\n\n1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:27.120\n And also there's an argument with Flow as well,\n\n1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:28.680\n but certainly with Olympics.\n\n1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:30.920\n There's a difference between what Flow does\n\n1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:32.640\n and what the Olympics represent.\n\n1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:33.800\n What do you mean by that?\n\n1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:35.840\n Like it feels like the Olympics,\n\n1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:38.080\n which is what the charter says,\n\n1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:41.320\n should be as accessible as possible.\n\n1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:42.160\n Yes, that's true.\n\n1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:44.120\n Like you should really lower the barrier\n\n1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:45.800\n for entry for the Olympics.\n\n1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.040\n You know that's what the charter says,\n\n1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:48.160\n but those people in the IOC,\n\n1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:50.400\n these are the worst people ever.\n\n1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:51.240\n They're very bad.\n\n1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:52.640\n Well, they're not bad.\n\n1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:55.720\n They just lost touch of the dream they once had\n\n1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:56.880\n when they joined the IOC.\n\n1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:58.920\n Well, I would argue all the way back\n\n1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:01.160\n that these are rich fat cats who,\n\n1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:02.760\n like I get so mad about the NCAA,\n\n1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:07.080\n which finally now got rid of this bullshit term amateurism.\n\n1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:08.720\n It's like, well, there's some holy grail\n\n1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:11.120\n where you can't make money to be an amateur athlete,\n\n1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:12.800\n but the people who own the IOC\n\n1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:15.320\n or the people who own the institutions,\n\n1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:17.040\n college institutions are making boatloads of money\n\n1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:18.320\n off of you, that's crap.\n\n1:17:19.160 --> 1:17:24.160\n So you competed, like you said, at the 2008 Olympics.\n\n1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:26.280\n Did you believe you can win gold?\n\n1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:27.840\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:17:27.840 --> 1:17:30.480\n So your mental game was on point.\n\n1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:31.400\n Yeah, I was ready.\n\n1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:33.400\n So what went wrong?\n\n1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:34.800\n This wasn't good enough.\n\n1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:35.760\n That was what I said.\n\n1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:36.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:38.320\n Yeah, I mean, so at that point in time,\n\n1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:41.760\n it was my first year of international competition.\n\n1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:43.320\n So when I came out in 2007,\n\n1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:45.280\n it was my first time making 74 kilograms,\n\n1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:47.520\n which is pretty small for me.\n\n1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:50.840\n I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around\n\n1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:53.440\n and I was having success in America.\n\n1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:54.800\n I was beating everyone.\n\n1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:57.080\n I don't wanna say easy, but yeah,\n\n1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.400\n I was doing really well.\n\n1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:02.360\n I went international one time,\n\n1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:05.680\n and there was one match I got cheated on.\n\n1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:07.840\n The Russians, they're cheaters.\n\n1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:09.600\n Excuse you, Ukraine, not Russia.\n\n1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:13.560\n I lost one real match where I actually lost,\n\n1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:15.520\n and it was to Denis Sarguch,\n\n1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:17.080\n who would go on to win three world titles,\n\n1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:18.920\n but he was behind the T of that year,\n\n1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:20.160\n and it was competitive.\n\n1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:23.800\n So I knew, okay, I'm going with the best guys in the world.\n\n1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:27.640\n I beat a bunch of other guys who were good\n\n1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:29.600\n and had passed decent results.\n\n1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:31.960\n So I knew I was right there.\n\n1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:35.040\n Unfortunately, I ran into this guy, Ivan Fundora,\n\n1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:38.120\n and I had someone do scouting reports for him,\n\n1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:38.960\n actually my high school coach,\n\n1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:41.520\n who now coaches for our academy, John Messimerich,\n\n1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:43.520\n and Fundora was the worst stylistic matchup.\n\n1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:46.880\n I got him, and I lost him second round.\n\n1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:49.000\n So I wasn't good enough.\n\n1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.960\n Had I decided to keep wrestling,\n\n1:18:50.960 --> 1:18:52.040\n I probably would have gotten better,\n\n1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:53.840\n but at that point, I just wasn't in the cards.\n\n1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:56.440\n So in your division was, like you said, it's the T of,\n\n1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:01.120\n if I said it's the T of, that guy's special.\n\n1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:02.240\n He's very special.\n\n1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:04.120\n So that would be my other guy that you asked earlier\n\n1:19:04.120 --> 1:19:06.880\n who I enjoyed watching, and that was a guy I,\n\n1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:08.200\n again, it was kind of after the fact\n\n1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:10.400\n because it was hard to access footage,\n\n1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:12.280\n but he was a lot of fun to watch.\n\n1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:14.040\n What do you think made him great?\n\n1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:17.280\n A lot of people talk about him\n\n1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:20.280\n as potentially one of the greatest ever.\n\n1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:21.120\n Absolutely.\n\n1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:22.920\n I mean, so he won six and three,\n\n1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:26.720\n six Worlds, three Olympics, nine total,\n\n1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:29.120\n which there's only one or two people above that.\n\n1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:32.960\n So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him,\n\n1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:35.360\n but from what I've seen, his feel is different.\n\n1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:36.960\n He was just ahead of his time,\n\n1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:38.480\n and the feel and the touch he had\n\n1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:40.400\n for certain moves and different things,\n\n1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:43.200\n because obviously physically he's kind of unimposing.\n\n1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:45.720\n He's taller than skinnier,\n\n1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:47.760\n which it can work in wrestling,\n\n1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:50.560\n but it is by less represented.\n\n1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:54.520\n So yeah, he was special, so good.\n\n1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:57.560\n Do you take any inspiration from,\n\n1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:00.200\n let's talk about Dagestan in general.\n\n1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:02.680\n What do you think makes those wrestlers great?\n\n1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:04.120\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:06.280\n Have you read the book, The Talent Code?\n\n1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:07.200\n Yeah. It's great.\n\n1:20:07.200 --> 1:20:09.120\n And that kind of talks about these talent hotspots\n\n1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:09.960\n all around the world.\n\n1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:12.040\n So now obviously with our wrestling academies,\n\n1:20:12.040 --> 1:20:15.480\n we try to take some lessons from that and apply it.\n\n1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:17.320\n I got to assume, they didn't cover Dagestan\n\n1:20:17.320 --> 1:20:19.200\n in that book specifically,\n\n1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:22.120\n but I got to assume a lot of the same principles\n\n1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:26.400\n that are in that book apply to Dagestan in wrestling.\n\n1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:29.720\n They did South Korea and women's golf.\n\n1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:31.440\n They did Curacao in baseball.\n\n1:20:31.440 --> 1:20:32.560\n They picked a lot of these other places\n\n1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:33.960\n that were really elite.\n\n1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:36.760\n I think it was maybe Moscow in women's tennis also.\n\n1:20:37.840 --> 1:20:39.600\n So I think all of these things\n\n1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:43.280\n that make any group great organization\n\n1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:45.400\n is probably the same things that's happening there.\n\n1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:47.640\n Well, the hardship, I mean,\n\n1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:49.440\n is there something specific about wrestling\n\n1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:53.400\n that can create so many great champions?\n\n1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:55.400\n From that area?\n\n1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:58.960\n So obviously they all love the big deal.\n\n1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:01.200\n Wrestling specifically is a big deal there.\n\n1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:03.720\n They do Sambo also, obviously.\n\n1:21:03.720 --> 1:21:05.920\n So that's part of it is a lot of the kids are doing it.\n\n1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:08.640\n They obviously are rough tumble, tough life.\n\n1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:09.840\n Getting a lot of fights.\n\n1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:12.520\n And then I think that also that a lot of them,\n\n1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:14.320\n it is a way out right there.\n\n1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:16.800\n The elite level athletes in that part of the world,\n\n1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:18.680\n from my understanding, are really well compensated\n\n1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:21.280\n compared to what the average person makes\n\n1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:22.200\n and they're treated really well.\n\n1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:23.960\n So people see it as a way out.\n\n1:21:23.960 --> 1:21:25.800\n Whereas like, and then honestly,\n\n1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:27.800\n if America is getting better,\n\n1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:29.520\n but in 2008, the reason I went to MMA\n\n1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:32.440\n was because I didn't want to be poor my whole life.\n\n1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:33.280\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:34.120\n It sucked.\n\n1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:35.040\n It's like, well, I don't want to make $20,000\n\n1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:37.120\n for the next 48 years.\n\n1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.040\n So I'm going to go do something else.\n\n1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:41.080\n If I could have made, even I didn't need to be rich, right?\n\n1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:43.560\n If I could have made $100,000 or $70,000 wrestling,\n\n1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:46.200\n I probably would have kept wrestling.\n\n1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:48.200\n So I think there's factors\n\n1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:51.000\n and obviously now they have a really like,\n\n1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.880\n a bunch of really good people in one area.\n\n1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:55.400\n So there's probably, and it's been going on for a long time.\n\n1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:57.120\n So there's probably been a bunch of like adults\n\n1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:59.640\n and coaches that are coming back and helping that progress.\n\n1:21:59.640 --> 1:22:01.640\n So yeah, a lot of those things that happen.\n\n1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:04.240\n So I'm definitely going to travel there to talk to them\n\n1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:05.280\n because I can speak Russian.\n\n1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:06.600\n It makes it very,\n\n1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:11.640\n makes me uniquely qualified to.\n\n1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:15.240\n My brother can speak a little bit of Russian.\n\n1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:16.960\n Your brother can? Yeah.\n\n1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:19.680\n Okay, like a little bit like he swears and.\n\n1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:20.520\n No, no, no, no.\n\n1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:23.920\n Like he would, oh man, don't, don't make me oversell.\n\n1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:25.720\n I think he would be able to have a conversation with you.\n\n1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:26.560\n I think.\n\n1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:27.600\n Okay.\n\n1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:28.480\n Probably not like you.\n\n1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:31.160\n What's the, what's the reason he knows Russian?\n\n1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:33.040\n I don't know why he got obsessed with languages.\n\n1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:35.000\n And so his college degree is actually,\n\n1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:37.200\n what are they called?\n\n1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:38.680\n Interdis, where you have three minors.\n\n1:22:38.680 --> 1:22:43.120\n So he had a minor in Russian, a minor in Spanish\n\n1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:46.200\n and maybe Japanese, I'm messing up.\n\n1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:48.320\n It's definitely, it's Russian and Spanish for sure.\n\n1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:49.720\n I don't know what the third one is.\n\n1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:52.840\n No, but yeah, Dagestan, it's really fascinating.\n\n1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:57.000\n But the emphasis on technique, the lighter drilling,\n\n1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.040\n like they don't really go super hard.\n\n1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:01.320\n Yeah, and I only spent a couple, so I was there,\n\n1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:03.280\n I was in Vladikavkaz in 2008.\n\n1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:04.920\n That was where the World Cup was.\n\n1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:06.960\n We had to train there for like two days afterwards.\n\n1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:10.480\n So I didn't get to dig deep,\n\n1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:14.160\n dig deep into what was going on or anything.\n\n1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:19.160\n But yeah, I mean, I think sparring is very beneficial\n\n1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:24.280\n for wrestling, not like sparring MMA is we fight, right?\n\n1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:27.440\n Sparring in wrestling is, so I always just describe it\n\n1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:29.360\n to be really simple.\n\n1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:31.880\n If we're drilling, it's relatively 0% resistance.\n\n1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:33.840\n If we're going as hard as we can, that's 100%.\n\n1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:36.400\n There's all this gray area in the middle that's sparring,\n\n1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:37.240\n right?\n\n1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:40.760\n So if you have a good relationship,\n\n1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:43.360\n like college me and my brother, we could just go\n\n1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:45.280\n and we know where each other's at.\n\n1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:46.520\n We don't even have to talk about it, right?\n\n1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:47.960\n But like in my wrestling club, I'll say,\n\n1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:51.500\n okay, hey, I want you guys to go 50% in this position.\n\n1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:54.240\n Or I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot\n\n1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:56.600\n and this is for him, so I want him to go 70.\n\n1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:58.240\n And the defensive guy, I want you to go 40.\n\n1:23:58.240 --> 1:23:59.960\n So you're not supposed to be trying to win here.\n\n1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:00.800\n You're gonna go a little later.\n\n1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:03.480\n I want you to give him some looks, you know?\n\n1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:05.280\n So I think it has really taken hold in America.\n\n1:24:05.280 --> 1:24:06.960\n I think it's really beneficial for success.\n\n1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:09.480\n And I think that's, I mean, America's doing better\n\n1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:11.000\n than we've ever done historically.\n\n1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.200\n Well, that 70 and 40, that's like an art form\n\n1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:14.360\n to find that right place,\n\n1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:17.800\n because the really good people I've trained with,\n\n1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:22.040\n they go much closer to 100% speed wise,\n\n1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:27.360\n but without forcing things the way you would\n\n1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:28.200\n when you're going.\n\n1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:30.720\n It's some weird combination of things that,\n\n1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:33.320\n like if you truly earn a technique,\n\n1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:36.520\n then you're given that technique.\n\n1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:38.360\n But if you don't, you don't.\n\n1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:42.280\n And then it becomes much less injury prone.\n\n1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:44.600\n It becomes somehow more fun, more dynamic.\n\n1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:46.480\n You don't get stuck in positions.\n\n1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:48.560\n It's just a lot of movement.\n\n1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:51.600\n Yeah, the one thing, so you and John talked about,\n\n1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:54.080\n like different ways to learn and get better.\n\n1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:55.640\n And so I think John obviously innovated\n\n1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:57.360\n within the sport of jiu jitsu.\n\n1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:03.560\n And so for us, and maybe there's a differentiator for us.\n\n1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:04.400\n I think about it like.\n\n1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:05.280\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:07.160\n You have this academy and you sent me this plan.\n\n1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:10.040\n They have like a really well thought through plan\n\n1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:12.280\n for how to develop a good wrestler.\n\n1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:16.960\n So I think it's, for me there's four categories, right?\n\n1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:20.240\n There's the teaching, which is like, you don't know shit.\n\n1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.400\n You're coming in and I'm showing you the move\n\n1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:24.680\n and you're literally going out there and you're trying.\n\n1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:26.240\n To me, that's not even drilling.\n\n1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:29.480\n That's like teaching, like you're trying to learn something.\n\n1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:32.360\n So obviously in someone's earlier periods,\n\n1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:34.920\n they're spending a lot of time in that phase\n\n1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:36.400\n because they literally don't even know\n\n1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:38.680\n how to move their bodies the right way.\n\n1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:40.920\n Once you learn the skill, then there's the drilling\n\n1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:43.200\n because you absolutely have to get those reps\n\n1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:46.160\n to become really proficient in that movement\n\n1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:48.240\n and then the sparring and then the live, right?\n\n1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:51.400\n And so like, I think obviously by the time you get\n\n1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:53.800\n to the kind of, I don't wanna say end point, right?\n\n1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:58.320\n But further on, the time you spend teaching is so,\n\n1:25:58.320 --> 1:25:59.560\n I don't wanna say, I'm sorry,\n\n1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:02.520\n in the learning teaching phase is not insignificant,\n\n1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:04.040\n but it's so much smaller because to someone\n\n1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:06.080\n who's really good, who I've coached for 10 years,\n\n1:26:06.080 --> 1:26:08.640\n I don't have to give this big long drawn out explanation.\n\n1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:11.600\n I just have to say, hey, move your hand a little differently\n\n1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:13.000\n or just do this, right?\n\n1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.400\n We don't have to spend any time there.\n\n1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:16.400\n So I think that's like something that consumes\n\n1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:19.920\n for the younger kids, say five through 12 or 13,\n\n1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:22.600\n we're consuming a massive amount of time there\n\n1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:24.760\n on that teaching learning phase.\n\n1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:28.560\n And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot.\n\n1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.080\n But that makes total sense, right?\n\n1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:31.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:34.480\n It's funny because when you look at like jiu jitsu schools,\n\n1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:36.920\n they spend a lot of time in the teaching learning\n\n1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:40.160\n and then the live, like there's not enough drilling.\n\n1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:42.240\n I like how you draw a distinction there\n\n1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:45.680\n because it feels like you're always starting from scratch.\n\n1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:48.840\n Like people have like very crappy short term memory.\n\n1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:52.900\n Like they're not, like the way teaching is done\n\n1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:55.080\n is you show a technique from scratch\n\n1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:57.080\n and it seems disjoint.\n\n1:26:57.080 --> 1:26:58.840\n It is for sure, especially if you have a class\n\n1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:00.280\n that's been with you for a while,\n\n1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:01.400\n you don't have to start from scratch.\n\n1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:04.200\n You can say, hey, let's focus on this one little thing here\n\n1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:07.160\n or let's, after we do this, let's do that,\n\n1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.280\n and you kind of put, start putting it all together.\n\n1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:12.720\n And then with jiu jitsu, the thing that I really struggled\n\n1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:14.020\n with was a couple of things.\n\n1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:17.600\n It was, and this is not speaking for all the jiu jitians,\n\n1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:19.880\n my personal experience through the sport.\n\n1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:21.880\n And I actually found my, so when I unretired,\n\n1:27:21.880 --> 1:27:23.680\n I found someone really great that I loved\n\n1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:25.120\n and I really wish it was Mark Lehman.\n\n1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:26.200\n I don't know if you know him at all.\n\n1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:28.480\n I wish I would have found him earlier\n\n1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:30.480\n because he was just tremendous.\n\n1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:32.540\n But number one, there's no drilling.\n\n1:27:32.540 --> 1:27:35.800\n So it's like, in wrestling, I can boil down to,\n\n1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:40.640\n I can probably name you the best six moves, right?\n\n1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:43.580\n So we need, as younger people, single leg, right?\n\n1:27:43.580 --> 1:27:45.280\n Single leg's gonna be the most proficient takedown.\n\n1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:47.040\n It always has been, I don't know,\n\n1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:47.880\n probably always will be,\n\n1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:49.820\n unless they figure out something different.\n\n1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:52.320\n The robot.\n\n1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:53.440\n The robot figures out something different.\n\n1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:54.760\n We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs.\n\n1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:55.600\n Why?\n\n1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:56.760\n Because everyone's gonna do that, right?\n\n1:27:56.760 --> 1:27:58.400\n We're gonna shoot a lot of single legs.\n\n1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:02.080\n So just like, say, an armbar or some type of sweep, right?\n\n1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:03.920\n Why can't we go get 50 reps there?\n\n1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:06.540\n Hey, by the time I've been in your jiu jitsu school\n\n1:28:06.540 --> 1:28:08.360\n for two years, I better know a fucking armbar.\n\n1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:09.480\n I better know it.\n\n1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:11.320\n So don't spend 10 minutes teaching me.\n\n1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:12.920\n Just tell me to go hit 50 reps.\n\n1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:14.660\n And then if, when I'm hitting my reps,\n\n1:28:14.660 --> 1:28:16.440\n if there's something I'm doing wrong,\n\n1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:17.960\n then just say, hey, Ben,\n\n1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:19.280\n move your leg a little bit that way\n\n1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:21.080\n or raise your hips up a little more, right?\n\n1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:23.280\n Like, correct as you're drilling\n\n1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:24.680\n so you're getting all these reps at it\n\n1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:26.360\n so you're becoming more proficient.\n\n1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:27.880\n And then the other thing I really struggled with was,\n\n1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:30.160\n to your point during live,\n\n1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:33.160\n so many times it's just this five minute go, go, go.\n\n1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.240\n And that's not the most efficient way to learn\n\n1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:37.240\n because when you have two people,\n\n1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:39.240\n especially when they're focused on winning,\n\n1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:41.960\n and you say go, they're gonna go to wherever they do best.\n\n1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:43.640\n Well, if I'm trying to make you good at something,\n\n1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:45.880\n I don't want you doing what you do best all the time.\n\n1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:47.800\n I need you doing some other things, right?\n\n1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:48.920\n If you have a great single leg\n\n1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:51.020\n but you can't shoot to the other side of the body,\n\n1:28:51.020 --> 1:28:52.780\n we need to work on that, right?\n\n1:28:52.780 --> 1:28:54.640\n You need to start shooting the other side.\n\n1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:56.480\n There's some sense that you,\n\n1:28:56.480 --> 1:28:58.720\n it's not like you should be told what to work on\n\n1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:00.920\n but you should be told to work on the thing\n\n1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:02.320\n that you wanna work on.\n\n1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:05.140\n Meaning, I don't know, maybe you can comment on this,\n\n1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:07.740\n but everybody develops a different game\n\n1:29:07.740 --> 1:29:08.780\n as you get better and better.\n\n1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:11.600\n There's a set of things you need to be working on.\n\n1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:14.160\n So I actually have, like when I,\n\n1:29:14.160 --> 1:29:17.100\n especially when I'm training very seriously,\n\n1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:21.080\n I'll have a specific technique that I have in mind\n\n1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:24.880\n and I have a sheet of paper on the side\n\n1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:26.800\n where I literally, my head keep counting off\n\n1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:29.280\n how many times I put myself in that position\n\n1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:30.320\n and pulled off the technique.\n\n1:29:30.320 --> 1:29:32.880\n And that's all I care about in like training.\n\n1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:35.320\n So I'll just, whatever it is,\n\n1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:37.120\n if it's a guillotine, it's a guillotine,\n\n1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:41.280\n arm drag, arm drag, but I wanna make sure I don't,\n\n1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:44.140\n I love numbers, so I'll say like,\n\n1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:47.320\n I'll make sure I get 50 arm drags\n\n1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:49.560\n and I'm not getting off the mat until I do.\n\n1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:50.800\n And that, you know, if it takes.\n\n1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:53.040\n Any thrilling or live contest?\n\n1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:55.320\n So in this, in the thing I'm describing right now\n\n1:29:55.320 --> 1:29:56.160\n is the live contest.\n\n1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:56.980\n Okay, got it.\n\n1:29:56.980 --> 1:29:59.840\n But drilling, obviously, drilling.\n\n1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:01.880\n So I feel like I can't find a drilling part,\n\n1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:04.400\n like it's so hard to find drilling partners, even.\n\n1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:05.540\n So boring.\n\n1:30:05.540 --> 1:30:07.880\n It's annoying to me that this is boring.\n\n1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:09.840\n And there's nothing more annoying to me\n\n1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:12.160\n than the look of boredom on another person's face\n\n1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:13.040\n when we're drilling.\n\n1:30:13.040 --> 1:30:13.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:14.720\n It's like, don't you.\n\n1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:15.560\n Do you really think drilling's that beneficial to you?\n\n1:30:15.560 --> 1:30:16.640\n Cause you said it's a job.\n\n1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:17.480\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:30:17.480 --> 1:30:18.300\n Really?\n\n1:30:18.300 --> 1:30:19.140\n And he thinks I'm an idiot, but yes.\n\n1:30:19.140 --> 1:30:20.460\n Why?\n\n1:30:20.460 --> 1:30:21.720\n Why am I, am I an idiot?\n\n1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:23.520\n Or why is this drilling beneficial?\n\n1:30:23.520 --> 1:30:26.000\n Well, let's go with two trick questions.\n\n1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:28.200\n Why is it so beneficial?\n\n1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:33.200\n I think for me, it's, there's a meditative aspect to it\n\n1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:36.880\n where the more you drill,\n\n1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:40.960\n the more you start noticing the details.\n\n1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:43.720\n Let me push back a little bit here.\n\n1:30:43.720 --> 1:30:44.800\n I'm not going to push back all the way.\n\n1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:47.200\n Cause every time, if I was wrestling,\n\n1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:49.680\n I'll warm up my head, crotch, shin, leg, whatever, right?\n\n1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:51.760\n But even, so say like at a high level\n\n1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:53.960\n when I'm really wrestling, say 10 years ago,\n\n1:30:55.060 --> 1:30:56.760\n even during that drill portion,\n\n1:30:56.760 --> 1:30:58.480\n if we talk about the resistance of our opponent\n\n1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:00.040\n from zero to 100,\n\n1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:04.000\n it's very likely that my partner at that point,\n\n1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:05.480\n and this is people I'm really comfortable with,\n\n1:31:05.480 --> 1:31:07.360\n they're probably at least going 20 or 30, right?\n\n1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:09.800\n They're probably giving me a certain look with the sprawl\n\n1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:11.640\n or, you know, I got to get through their hands.\n\n1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:13.040\n If I don't set it up right,\n\n1:31:13.040 --> 1:31:14.880\n they might put their arm down, right?\n\n1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:16.960\n So it's like, we are drilling\n\n1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:19.480\n cause we're wrestling at a really low resistance level,\n\n1:31:19.480 --> 1:31:20.680\n but there's a little bit of sparring.\n\n1:31:20.680 --> 1:31:21.520\n Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n1:31:21.520 --> 1:31:22.760\n The 20%, the 20, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:24.600\n Yeah, so that's not really drilling.\n\n1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:25.640\n Cause I think it's drilling.\n\n1:31:25.640 --> 1:31:27.200\n I think literally you're shooting\n\n1:31:27.200 --> 1:31:28.360\n and I'm just going boom, I'm like,\n\n1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:31.120\n show me your dummy, boom, boom, boom, boom type of thing.\n\n1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:32.800\n No, but it's very hard to be a dummy\n\n1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:35.400\n that doesn't do 20%, so you're going to do 20%.\n\n1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:37.440\n Yeah, that's so, so yes, that's 20%.\n\n1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:38.260\n But.\n\n1:31:38.260 --> 1:31:40.080\n So that's like sparring a little bit then.\n\n1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:41.800\n No, but they're not really resisting.\n\n1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:43.600\n They're just giving you the right frame.\n\n1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:46.280\n They're giving you the right like movement\n\n1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:49.900\n and they're being an intelligent dummy, essentially.\n\n1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:53.120\n I mean, but also like the really important component\n\n1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:56.320\n of this is you pick the techniques for which is beneficial.\n\n1:31:56.320 --> 1:31:59.600\n If the technique is, has dynamic elements to it,\n\n1:31:59.600 --> 1:32:02.160\n you don't want to be doing that with,\n\n1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.520\n I'm saying like there's certain moves\n\n1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.140\n and I like those moves and I select the game base\n\n1:32:08.140 --> 1:32:08.980\n in those moves.\n\n1:32:08.980 --> 1:32:10.600\n So are you drilling to get better\n\n1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:12.300\n or are you drilling just to work out?\n\n1:32:12.300 --> 1:32:13.700\n No, to get better.\n\n1:32:13.700 --> 1:32:14.600\n That's what I'm trying to tell you.\n\n1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:17.800\n I believe you can become like exceptionally good\n\n1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:19.180\n very fast by drilling.\n\n1:32:19.180 --> 1:32:20.020\n But how?\n\n1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:24.600\n First of all, let me ask you an empirical question.\n\n1:32:24.600 --> 1:32:28.720\n Let me, have you actually drilled 10,000 times\n\n1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:29.560\n a particular move?\n\n1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:30.400\n Millions.\n\n1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:32.640\n You haven't drilled millions.\n\n1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:34.640\n Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands likely.\n\n1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:36.760\n I think you're just saying numbers.\n\n1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:37.600\n I don't think you know what 100,000.\n\n1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:39.040\n The numbers are freaking astronomical.\n\n1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:39.960\n It's way more than 10,000.\n\n1:32:39.960 --> 1:32:41.920\n I don't think you know what 100,000 feels like.\n\n1:32:41.920 --> 1:32:42.940\n Dude, there was a 10 year period\n\n1:32:42.940 --> 1:32:44.080\n where I wrestled every single day.\n\n1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:47.720\n That's 3,000 days, so you're telling me 10,000,\n\n1:32:47.720 --> 1:32:48.760\n that's only three of them a day.\n\n1:32:48.760 --> 1:32:50.720\n I do way more than that.\n\n1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:51.560\n Three of them.\n\n1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:52.380\n Probably 30 of them a day.\n\n1:32:52.380 --> 1:32:53.560\n That's 100,000.\n\n1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:54.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:56.080\n Yeah, hundreds of thousands.\n\n1:32:56.080 --> 1:32:57.560\n I doubt you did 30 a day for a particular technique.\n\n1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:00.480\n I did, for sure, 100%.\n\n1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:01.320\n There's no doubt.\n\n1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:02.160\n All right.\n\n1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:04.120\n Because some days I might do 100, right?\n\n1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:05.840\n So 30 of 30 is not very many.\n\n1:33:05.840 --> 1:33:07.200\n Especially if we count all reps,\n\n1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:09.280\n if we're counting drilling and live.\n\n1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:11.920\n So like our college coaches would make us just drill a lot\n\n1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:12.960\n and I just hated it.\n\n1:33:12.960 --> 1:33:15.520\n So I would rebel and just kind of give a little spar.\n\n1:33:15.520 --> 1:33:17.100\n You shoot a high crotch, we'll start.\n\n1:33:17.100 --> 1:33:18.120\n Coach wants to drill a high crotch.\n\n1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:18.960\n Okay, we'll start.\n\n1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:20.120\n You shoot the high crotch, that's great.\n\n1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:22.400\n Then I'm gonna sit the corner or I'm gonna give you my hip\n\n1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:24.240\n or I'm gonna try something.\n\n1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:25.240\n So then you have to react.\n\n1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:29.400\n And I would argue that all skill level\n\n1:33:29.400 --> 1:33:34.000\n past the beginner stuff is some necessity of that, right?\n\n1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.200\n I'm gonna do this, then what are you gonna do?\n\n1:33:36.200 --> 1:33:37.200\n It's back and forth.\n\n1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:38.640\n I shoot a single leg, what are you gonna do?\n\n1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:39.880\n I shoot a high crotch, what are you gonna do?\n\n1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:42.380\n And you have to start unconsciously programming\n\n1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:43.220\n these things in your head.\n\n1:33:43.220 --> 1:33:44.280\n Because if you're too conscious to think about it,\n\n1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:45.720\n it's gonna be too slow to actually hit it at math.\n\n1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:48.120\n But the drilling is the unconscious programming.\n\n1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:51.240\n But the simple movement, the first simple movement,\n\n1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:53.280\n the first simple movement, that single leg\n\n1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:55.920\n or the high crotch or arm drag, whatever.\n\n1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:00.000\n Like I feel like the amount you're gonna get better at it\n\n1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.620\n is so minuscule compared to the amount you're gonna gain\n\n1:34:02.620 --> 1:34:05.680\n at doing other things around it.\n\n1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:08.280\n No, but that's the key word, you feel.\n\n1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:09.960\n That's your opinion.\n\n1:34:09.960 --> 1:34:13.560\n If we did a study on it, then I would be proven correct.\n\n1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:15.240\n No, perhaps.\n\n1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:16.920\n So first of all, your brain,\n\n1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:20.860\n as an exceptionally creative combat athlete,\n\n1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:24.560\n it's clear that you don't like the boredom of drilling.\n\n1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:26.920\n Like it's obvious that you have like,\n\n1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:28.680\n you're such a creative energy\n\n1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:31.360\n that you're just not going to be somebody\n\n1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:32.400\n who's going to enjoy that.\n\n1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:35.720\n So enjoyment is probably having an active mind\n\n1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:36.840\n is really important.\n\n1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:39.840\n So the question is, do you have the kind of makeup\n\n1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:44.680\n that has an active mind during a drilling on a dummy?\n\n1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:47.060\n And I have that mind.\n\n1:34:47.060 --> 1:34:47.900\n Like I can.\n\n1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:48.960\n But do you really think, okay,\n\n1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:51.200\n so if you're, let's pick a technique.\n\n1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:53.280\n What technique do you want to drill on?\n\n1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:54.800\n Are we doing jiu jitsu or wrestling?\n\n1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:55.760\n Whatever you want.\n\n1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:00.380\n It's hard to describe with words, but certain guard passes.\n\n1:35:00.380 --> 1:35:03.000\n Let me think, just guard pass.\n\n1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:04.940\n Okay, so you have a guard pass\n\n1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:07.160\n and you get it to be, I'd say nine and a half out of 10,\n\n1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:09.960\n right, just from a technical standpoint.\n\n1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:12.680\n Don't you think you need some resistance to feel?\n\n1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:15.180\n Because essentially all benefit after that\n\n1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:18.160\n is going to be, what are they going to try to do to me?\n\n1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:19.360\n And if they shift that way,\n\n1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:21.600\n do I need to sink here or move there?\n\n1:35:21.600 --> 1:35:25.080\n So it's like, I actually think we're agreeing,\n\n1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:27.160\n but maybe terminology wise.\n\n1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:28.920\n Well, the split is the important thing.\n\n1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:30.600\n Like how much of each?\n\n1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:32.040\n So I think it is spar.\n\n1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:34.580\n Like I think it's a very light touch spar\n\n1:35:34.580 --> 1:35:36.000\n is what you're talking about,\n\n1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.440\n which is in my opinion, really isn't drilling.\n\n1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:41.520\n And it's because drilling past the basic proficiency,\n\n1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:43.120\n I don't think brings much value.\n\n1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:45.840\n But that's what I'm trying to tell you is I think it does.\n\n1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:50.840\n I think doing that same movement,\n\n1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:54.880\n I think you begin to learn more over time.\n\n1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:57.700\n Like you're saying like once you get the basic proficiency,\n\n1:35:57.700 --> 1:36:00.000\n then there's a diminishing returns.\n\n1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:01.520\n I don't think so.\n\n1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:02.360\n I don't think so.\n\n1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:04.720\n I think everything has diminishing returns\n\n1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:06.240\n when you're learning a technique.\n\n1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:09.040\n But with something as complex as wrestling or grappling,\n\n1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:13.000\n if you can have way more gains over here,\n\n1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:16.660\n why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8?\n\n1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:19.800\n If this other area, if you're spending so much time here\n\n1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:21.800\n that this other area is left unexplored,\n\n1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:23.600\n you can make gigantic gains over there.\n\n1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:25.200\n No, but you're gonna lose.\n\n1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:28.000\n I think a lot depends on your style.\n\n1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.520\n I think a lot is determined by how good you are\n\n1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:33.220\n at one thing.\n\n1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:36.520\n And so if you wanna become a master of a particular thing\n\n1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:37.680\n and then make your whole game\n\n1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:41.080\n where it's all pulled into that system, then I don't know.\n\n1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:42.920\n I think one is too small of a number.\n\n1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:44.360\n Yeah, it's small.\n\n1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.880\n I feel like you can't be easily this, like I've.\n\n1:36:47.880 --> 1:36:50.040\n Yeah, you wanna funnel, you wanna create funnels.\n\n1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:51.280\n Funnels. Funnels, right?\n\n1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:52.680\n Where everything goes into a few positions.\n\n1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:53.520\n And then it's all field.\n\n1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:54.520\n Where I feel you win 100%.\n\n1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:55.500\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n1:36:55.500 --> 1:37:00.500\n But I feel you can get like drilling on a dummy 80%\n\n1:37:00.500 --> 1:37:05.500\n of the time and 20% of the time live rolling\n\n1:37:06.020 --> 1:37:07.600\n with people worse than you.\n\n1:37:08.540 --> 1:37:10.420\n Like a little bit worse than you.\n\n1:37:10.420 --> 1:37:11.260\n Or a lot worse than you.\n\n1:37:11.260 --> 1:37:13.240\n Yeah, so I think, I definitely think.\n\n1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.820\n So my buildup would be teach.\n\n1:37:17.820 --> 1:37:19.460\n So we're talking a complex technique, right?\n\n1:37:19.460 --> 1:37:21.380\n So by the time we're talking about,\n\n1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:24.820\n we'll say a late high school kid who's pretty proficient,\n\n1:37:24.820 --> 1:37:26.700\n he's probably done the drilling part.\n\n1:37:26.700 --> 1:37:28.460\n So then now it's like, okay,\n\n1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:30.300\n if I wanna get something new to you,\n\n1:37:30.300 --> 1:37:31.460\n I'll probably tell you,\n\n1:37:31.460 --> 1:37:32.860\n you'll probably be able to do the basic premise\n\n1:37:32.860 --> 1:37:35.380\n within five to 10 minutes if they're good, right?\n\n1:37:35.380 --> 1:37:36.820\n Do this, okay, they do it.\n\n1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:38.980\n Then it's like, okay, so now here from here,\n\n1:37:38.980 --> 1:37:40.820\n what we're gonna do, we're gonna go light sparring.\n\n1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:42.060\n So I know you have success.\n\n1:37:42.060 --> 1:37:43.500\n Cause I need you to complete the task\n\n1:37:43.500 --> 1:37:44.500\n in order to get better at it.\n\n1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.540\n That's something a lot of people in wrestling mess up,\n\n1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:47.940\n is they just wanna go with the toughest person.\n\n1:37:47.940 --> 1:37:49.380\n But if you go with the toughest person,\n\n1:37:49.380 --> 1:37:51.940\n you're not gonna actually execute on any skills.\n\n1:37:51.940 --> 1:37:54.100\n You're gonna get a workout and I need you to execute\n\n1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:55.020\n cause I need you to get good at this.\n\n1:37:55.020 --> 1:37:56.100\n In order to get good at it,\n\n1:37:56.100 --> 1:37:57.500\n you have to get all the way through the technique.\n\n1:37:57.500 --> 1:37:58.980\n Why do you need them to complete?\n\n1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:00.780\n Just so they gain confidence in the technique\n\n1:38:00.780 --> 1:38:01.620\n or they go through all this stuff?\n\n1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:03.660\n They have to feel all the way through.\n\n1:38:03.660 --> 1:38:07.100\n Like if I said, learn a high crotch when you're drilling\n\n1:38:07.100 --> 1:38:08.660\n but stop halfway every time.\n\n1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:10.620\n But you're not actually gonna be able to do it\n\n1:38:10.620 --> 1:38:12.660\n cause you're gonna stop, you're not gonna feel.\n\n1:38:12.660 --> 1:38:16.220\n So, you know, try it on someone, spar lightly, get it.\n\n1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:18.300\n Do it on someone who's not as good as you, get it.\n\n1:38:18.300 --> 1:38:20.220\n Then kind of work your way up the ladder\n\n1:38:20.220 --> 1:38:21.860\n so you can get it on someone your own skill level\n\n1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:24.940\n or maybe better than you, right, in a live competition.\n\n1:38:24.940 --> 1:38:26.300\n So it's like, I don't know,\n\n1:38:26.300 --> 1:38:28.140\n I feel like that basic drilling,\n\n1:38:28.140 --> 1:38:31.260\n so a kid like Keegan who I've brought up a few times,\n\n1:38:31.260 --> 1:38:32.580\n I feel like if there's something new,\n\n1:38:32.580 --> 1:38:33.900\n I could literally tell him,\n\n1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:34.860\n this is what I want you to do\n\n1:38:34.860 --> 1:38:36.420\n and he's such a great feeler,\n\n1:38:36.420 --> 1:38:37.900\n he could go drill it proficiently\n\n1:38:37.900 --> 1:38:40.140\n within probably a minute or two.\n\n1:38:40.140 --> 1:38:41.780\n But then to hit it on someone high level,\n\n1:38:41.780 --> 1:38:44.300\n that's gonna take quite a while longer.\n\n1:38:44.300 --> 1:38:48.060\n And that's a mix of drilling and sparring\n\n1:38:48.060 --> 1:38:49.860\n on people a little bit worse than you.\n\n1:38:49.860 --> 1:38:52.860\n Yeah, and then equal and then better, yeah.\n\n1:38:52.860 --> 1:38:53.700\n Okay.\n\n1:38:53.700 --> 1:38:56.300\n Yeah, because there's this, with grappling,\n\n1:38:56.300 --> 1:38:58.860\n there's such like a feel component to the pressure,\n\n1:38:58.860 --> 1:39:00.340\n the movement, all these things.\n\n1:39:00.340 --> 1:39:01.580\n And there's still, like I said,\n\n1:39:01.580 --> 1:39:03.220\n there's so many things you can throw at someone\n\n1:39:03.220 --> 1:39:05.900\n out of one position, not just moves,\n\n1:39:05.900 --> 1:39:08.580\n but moves at a different level of force or whatever.\n\n1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:11.580\n Are you and these kids developing\n\n1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:14.700\n like a big picture strategy of like,\n\n1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:18.740\n what are the main setups and take downs\n\n1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:20.460\n and just like a whole system?\n\n1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:24.300\n So I kind of sent you our technique book, right,\n\n1:39:24.300 --> 1:39:26.740\n how we kind of go at approach it.\n\n1:39:26.740 --> 1:39:29.500\n So I think in wrestling, you're going to need,\n\n1:39:31.020 --> 1:39:32.780\n you're gonna need a handful of things\n\n1:39:32.780 --> 1:39:34.940\n just off the word go, right?\n\n1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:37.140\n You're going to, so I think on our feet,\n\n1:39:37.140 --> 1:39:38.740\n I need to be able to take this out of the body.\n\n1:39:38.740 --> 1:39:40.820\n I need to be able to take that out of the body.\n\n1:39:40.820 --> 1:39:42.820\n I need to be able to bring you underneath me.\n\n1:39:42.820 --> 1:39:44.860\n I need to be able to go around you, right?\n\n1:39:44.860 --> 1:39:46.700\n Now we can accomplish those different ways,\n\n1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:48.340\n but we should have all of those weapons\n\n1:39:48.340 --> 1:39:51.100\n if we wanna be really good some way, right?\n\n1:39:51.100 --> 1:39:52.380\n So if I neglect one of those,\n\n1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:54.460\n so if I neglect the ability to say, pull you down, right?\n\n1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:55.380\n Front lock you.\n\n1:39:56.340 --> 1:39:58.460\n Now, if I have a good shot and you're smart,\n\n1:39:58.460 --> 1:39:59.540\n you're just gonna lower your stance.\n\n1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:01.980\n So my shot is not gonna be as successful\n\n1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:03.940\n and I have the inability to pull you down, right?\n\n1:40:03.940 --> 1:40:06.140\n So I kind of need all of those so I can,\n\n1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:09.180\n as they get better, I can point those things out.\n\n1:40:09.180 --> 1:40:11.140\n On bottom, my folks at bottom,\n\n1:40:11.140 --> 1:40:13.620\n there's certain things like you have to be good\n\n1:40:13.620 --> 1:40:15.540\n at leg right defense, right?\n\n1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:18.340\n You have to, I mean, at a high level or you're just gonna,\n\n1:40:18.340 --> 1:40:20.220\n when you get it in, you're just getting stuck there.\n\n1:40:20.220 --> 1:40:22.420\n Not gonna be able to escape.\n\n1:40:22.420 --> 1:40:24.940\n But besides that, yeah, there's a multitude of things\n\n1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:26.140\n that you can choose from and I'm gonna,\n\n1:40:26.140 --> 1:40:30.340\n depending on your body style and what you're good and bad\n\n1:40:30.340 --> 1:40:32.380\n at, I'm gonna probably develop something a little different.\n\n1:40:32.380 --> 1:40:34.440\n I might give you, hey, you do the quad pod,\n\n1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:37.100\n you'd be better at the knee slide, whatever.\n\n1:40:38.300 --> 1:40:40.580\n Yeah, top, kind of same thing.\n\n1:40:40.580 --> 1:40:42.420\n I have to ask you about Khabib.\n\n1:40:42.420 --> 1:40:44.820\n So I remember a while ago Rogan said\n\n1:40:44.820 --> 1:40:49.820\n that that's the perfect fight for Khabib, you are.\n\n1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:52.020\n So let me ask two questions.\n\n1:40:52.020 --> 1:40:55.580\n The first, do you think you can beat him in an MMA match\n\n1:40:55.580 --> 1:40:56.660\n when you're at your peak?\n\n1:40:56.660 --> 1:40:59.100\n Yeah, I don't like, yeah, I mean,\n\n1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:01.100\n it's one of those people where people will get really mad\n\n1:41:01.100 --> 1:41:02.580\n at me if I say yes, but yeah, I mean, I think.\n\n1:41:02.580 --> 1:41:03.600\n But how would you do it?\n\n1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:05.260\n How would you solve that puzzle?\n\n1:41:05.260 --> 1:41:08.900\n Yeah, I mean, we would grapple\n\n1:41:08.900 --> 1:41:10.140\n and I think I would be better than him.\n\n1:41:10.140 --> 1:41:12.340\n But you know, sometimes I feel weird saying this,\n\n1:41:12.340 --> 1:41:14.660\n people are like, yeah, right, you're full of shit.\n\n1:41:14.660 --> 1:41:18.020\n And, but that's no one out grappled him, right?\n\n1:41:18.020 --> 1:41:18.980\n I mean, nobody did.\n\n1:41:18.980 --> 1:41:20.700\n And maybe I'm wrong on this,\n\n1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:23.940\n but if we look at the best possible candidates,\n\n1:41:23.940 --> 1:41:25.140\n I'm definitely one of them.\n\n1:41:25.140 --> 1:41:28.560\n And then obviously I have a small size advantage too.\n\n1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:30.020\n So in a wrestling match,\n\n1:41:30.020 --> 1:41:33.060\n so we can just reduce that MMA match to a wrestling match.\n\n1:41:33.060 --> 1:41:35.280\n What do you think is the right strategy on him?\n\n1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.260\n Like, do you understand his style,\n\n1:41:39.180 --> 1:41:41.060\n his wrestling style, the pressure he applies?\n\n1:41:41.060 --> 1:41:44.060\n Do you understand how the hell he makes it happen?\n\n1:41:44.060 --> 1:41:46.940\n Yeah, I mean, he never, unfortunately,\n\n1:41:46.940 --> 1:41:48.820\n fought any real, who I would say,\n\n1:41:48.820 --> 1:41:50.540\n really, really high level wrestlers.\n\n1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:51.420\n I was actually really disappointed\n\n1:41:51.420 --> 1:41:52.920\n how bad Justin Gaethje's wrestling was,\n\n1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:55.700\n because Justin Gaethje had some solid success,\n\n1:41:55.700 --> 1:41:58.140\n but his wrestling was really bad in that fight.\n\n1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:00.460\n Gaethje had success in the NCAA?\n\n1:42:00.460 --> 1:42:03.940\n Yeah, I think he was seventh place, maybe, or somewhere.\n\n1:42:03.940 --> 1:42:05.580\n He was definitely all American.\n\n1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:06.860\n It was lower though.\n\n1:42:09.020 --> 1:42:11.220\n So yeah, I would like to see how he dealt with someone\n\n1:42:11.220 --> 1:42:12.640\n who was like, who I think, oh man,\n\n1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:14.460\n this guy's a really high level wrestler.\n\n1:42:14.460 --> 1:42:16.580\n Because we saw, and this is early in his career,\n\n1:42:16.580 --> 1:42:18.820\n but Gleason Tebow did give him some issues\n\n1:42:18.820 --> 1:42:19.980\n earlier in his career.\n\n1:42:21.220 --> 1:42:22.860\n So I would like to see him in that situation\n\n1:42:22.860 --> 1:42:23.700\n and see how he does.\n\n1:42:23.700 --> 1:42:26.820\n I would love to, I just love wrestling and grappling.\n\n1:42:26.820 --> 1:42:27.660\n Yeah, I'd love this.\n\n1:42:27.660 --> 1:42:30.940\n Someone said, hey, Ben, Khabib wants to roll with you.\n\n1:42:30.940 --> 1:42:32.100\n Okay, I'm there tomorrow.\n\n1:42:32.100 --> 1:42:33.020\n It sounds like a blast.\n\n1:42:33.020 --> 1:42:34.060\n Let's go.\n\n1:42:34.060 --> 1:42:35.980\n He's probably competitive as hell.\n\n1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:36.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:36.820 --> 1:42:37.940\n You're still competitive?\n\n1:42:37.940 --> 1:42:40.100\n I know when to be and when not to be.\n\n1:42:40.100 --> 1:42:41.260\n Say if I'm going to high school kids,\n\n1:42:41.260 --> 1:42:43.140\n or I'm not going to be competitive\n\n1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:45.700\n because then I'm just being a dick.\n\n1:42:45.700 --> 1:42:47.100\n How would you take him down?\n\n1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:49.040\n What?\n\n1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:49.860\n What are we talking about, real wrestling?\n\n1:42:49.860 --> 1:42:50.700\n Like wrestling, wrestling?\n\n1:42:50.700 --> 1:42:51.540\n Wrestling, wrestling.\n\n1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:53.740\n I would probably try to take single legs and stuff.\n\n1:42:53.740 --> 1:42:54.560\n Single legs?\n\n1:42:54.560 --> 1:42:55.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:56.900\n I haven't, okay.\n\n1:42:57.740 --> 1:42:58.580\n None, none.\n\n1:42:58.580 --> 1:43:01.080\n No, honestly, I don't have the slightest clue.\n\n1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:03.080\n I'd have to feel, I'd feel him out.\n\n1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:03.920\n But single legs is my best take on it.\n\n1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:06.900\n People talk about his wrestling being really good.\n\n1:43:06.900 --> 1:43:07.860\n People that train with him.\n\n1:43:07.860 --> 1:43:12.100\n So, okay, so I grilled someone, I will not say who,\n\n1:43:12.100 --> 1:43:13.180\n on the Ed Ruth thing,\n\n1:43:13.180 --> 1:43:15.580\n because Ed Ruth is very elite at folk style wrestling.\n\n1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:17.740\n He never became that great at fighting, unfortunately.\n\n1:43:17.740 --> 1:43:19.780\n Wait, Ed Ruth wrestled Khabib?\n\n1:43:19.780 --> 1:43:20.980\n They were on the same team for a while, yeah.\n\n1:43:20.980 --> 1:43:21.820\n Okay.\n\n1:43:21.820 --> 1:43:23.860\n And there was rumors that Khabib beat him up.\n\n1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:27.100\n And I said, I sure can't believe that.\n\n1:43:27.100 --> 1:43:29.500\n And I've heard that that was,\n\n1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:30.820\n if they were just straight wrestling,\n\n1:43:30.820 --> 1:43:33.060\n Ed would get slightly the better of it.\n\n1:43:33.060 --> 1:43:35.180\n Well, Ed Ruth is like one of the greats.\n\n1:43:35.180 --> 1:43:36.020\n He's great.\n\n1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:36.840\n He's really good.\n\n1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:37.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:39.460\n So that was what I heard.\n\n1:43:39.460 --> 1:43:41.320\n But in an MMA setting,\n\n1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:43.980\n because of all the tools that Khabib would get him.\n\n1:43:45.540 --> 1:43:46.380\n I don't know.\n\n1:43:47.620 --> 1:43:48.460\n But I agree.\n\n1:43:48.460 --> 1:43:49.740\n I agree with Rogan on this one.\n\n1:43:49.740 --> 1:43:50.740\n That would have been good to see.\n\n1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:51.580\n Yeah, I'm fine.\n\n1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:54.220\n So yeah, if Khabib wants to work out, I'd love it.\n\n1:43:54.220 --> 1:43:56.220\n I love wrestling and grappling.\n\n1:43:56.220 --> 1:43:57.060\n I don't do much Jiu Jitsu\n\n1:43:57.060 --> 1:43:58.620\n because I just don't have time for it anymore.\n\n1:43:58.620 --> 1:44:01.260\n I'm at the Wrestling Academy like every single day.\n\n1:44:01.260 --> 1:44:03.540\n But yeah, I loved Jiu Jitsu while I did it.\n\n1:44:03.540 --> 1:44:05.500\n And if I didn't have Wrestling Academies,\n\n1:44:05.500 --> 1:44:06.980\n I probably would still be doing Jiu Jitsu.\n\n1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:09.060\n Yeah, you do well in Jiu Jitsu as well.\n\n1:44:09.060 --> 1:44:12.180\n But let me ask you a ridiculous question.\n\n1:44:12.180 --> 1:44:15.060\n Who's the greatest of all time, freestyle or folk style?\n\n1:44:15.060 --> 1:44:15.900\n Oh, wrestling.\n\n1:44:15.900 --> 1:44:16.740\n Wrestling.\n\n1:44:16.740 --> 1:44:17.580\n Hmm.\n\n1:44:17.580 --> 1:44:22.140\n Well, I will say my knowledge past like the year 2000\n\n1:44:22.140 --> 1:44:25.260\n is really not that great.\n\n1:44:25.260 --> 1:44:26.100\n Because you can't be.\n\n1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:26.920\n In which direction?\n\n1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:27.760\n Sorry, after 2000?\n\n1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:28.600\n No, no, before.\n\n1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:30.100\n Because you can't find any film or anything, you know?\n\n1:44:30.100 --> 1:44:31.300\n And so you hear of all these.\n\n1:44:31.300 --> 1:44:32.300\n So you need evidence?\n\n1:44:32.300 --> 1:44:33.380\n You need direct evidence?\n\n1:44:33.380 --> 1:44:35.020\n I want to be able to watch them and see them\n\n1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:36.740\n and feel the times and feel their opponents\n\n1:44:36.740 --> 1:44:38.980\n and all those things to really like,\n\n1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:40.820\n I hate giving bad answers, you know?\n\n1:44:40.820 --> 1:44:44.820\n So there's just not enough footage of any of those people.\n\n1:44:44.820 --> 1:44:47.740\n You know, we go back to someone like Alexander Medved.\n\n1:44:47.740 --> 1:44:48.980\n Like, you can't find footage.\n\n1:44:48.980 --> 1:44:50.340\n You can't find anything on him, you know?\n\n1:44:50.340 --> 1:44:52.140\n It's like, who is the wrestler?\n\n1:44:52.140 --> 1:44:53.220\n I'm not sure.\n\n1:44:53.220 --> 1:44:57.840\n So post 2000, I think, and obviously just freestyle.\n\n1:44:57.840 --> 1:44:58.680\n So.\n\n1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:01.300\n Americans, Russians?\n\n1:45:01.300 --> 1:45:04.140\n Oh, it's just that T.F. has probably the best argument\n\n1:45:04.140 --> 1:45:04.980\n post 2000.\n\n1:45:04.980 --> 1:45:08.940\n Yeah, the Russian tank, that guy is, yeah.\n\n1:45:08.940 --> 1:45:11.380\n So who's better, Snyder or Sajilov?\n\n1:45:11.380 --> 1:45:12.780\n So Sajilov just won at the Olympics.\n\n1:45:12.780 --> 1:45:13.620\n Now, I understand this.\n\n1:45:13.620 --> 1:45:14.660\n I don't understand how that works,\n\n1:45:14.660 --> 1:45:16.940\n but it's pretty close, right?\n\n1:45:16.940 --> 1:45:17.940\n Not really.\n\n1:45:17.940 --> 1:45:19.860\n Not that match, but in general, the matchup.\n\n1:45:19.860 --> 1:45:22.820\n So, well, so Kyle won the first one in 17.\n\n1:45:22.820 --> 1:45:24.820\n Sajilov pinned him the following year.\n\n1:45:24.820 --> 1:45:28.520\n But then Kyle lost and took bronze in 19.\n\n1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:30.500\n And then just lost.\n\n1:45:30.500 --> 1:45:32.120\n I don't want to say fairly decisively,\n\n1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:35.180\n but it was six to three and it was a late take down.\n\n1:45:35.180 --> 1:45:38.200\n He kind of gave it up and maybe if it was really competitive,\n\n1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:39.460\n maybe he wouldn't have.\n\n1:45:40.980 --> 1:45:43.220\n They're gonna wrestle again in like two weeks here.\n\n1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:45.780\n So that, you know, yeah, I mean,\n\n1:45:45.780 --> 1:45:47.140\n you have to say Sajilov at this point.\n\n1:45:47.140 --> 1:45:48.460\n There's nothing else to say\n\n1:45:48.460 --> 1:45:50.780\n unless Kyle proves us otherwise.\n\n1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:53.700\n Yeah, not enough people talk about Sajilov.\n\n1:45:53.700 --> 1:45:57.540\n Okay, well, you think that guy should go to MMA?\n\n1:45:57.540 --> 1:45:59.100\n You think Kyle should go to MMA?\n\n1:45:59.100 --> 1:45:59.940\n Some of these guys.\n\n1:45:59.940 --> 1:46:01.620\n Yeah, they're making enough money in wrestling\n\n1:46:01.620 --> 1:46:03.160\n where they don't really feel the need to.\n\n1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:04.300\n It's great. It's terrifying though.\n\n1:46:04.300 --> 1:46:06.900\n It's a heavyweight, Sajilov would probably,\n\n1:46:06.900 --> 1:46:09.300\n it's like Khabib, but heavyweight.\n\n1:46:09.300 --> 1:46:10.140\n Well, I don't know if you remember,\n\n1:46:10.140 --> 1:46:12.400\n do you remember Bilal Makov?\n\n1:46:12.400 --> 1:46:14.920\n So Bilal Makov actually was the Russian representative\n\n1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:17.760\n in both styles in 2016, Greco and freestyle.\n\n1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:20.900\n And he was, to my knowledge,\n\n1:46:20.900 --> 1:46:22.680\n the only person the UFC has ever signed\n\n1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:24.700\n that was zero and zero, in modern era,\n\n1:46:24.700 --> 1:46:25.920\n signed that was zero and zero.\n\n1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:28.280\n And then he actually never ended up fighting.\n\n1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:29.680\n But weird, right?\n\n1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:31.060\n So yeah. No motivation.\n\n1:46:31.060 --> 1:46:32.780\n I don't know what the story is.\n\n1:46:32.780 --> 1:46:34.060\n Cause sometimes out of Russia,\n\n1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:35.940\n I mean, maybe you have better sources than I do.\n\n1:46:35.940 --> 1:46:37.840\n Sometimes it feels like dudes just disappear.\n\n1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:39.660\n Like they're a world champ or a little big champ\n\n1:46:39.660 --> 1:46:42.740\n and then all of a sudden you're like, wait, where'd he go?\n\n1:46:42.740 --> 1:46:45.300\n You talked shit about Russia earlier in the conversation.\n\n1:46:45.300 --> 1:46:46.440\n So. Oh, what'd I say?\n\n1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:48.380\n I forgot, but I think.\n\n1:46:48.380 --> 1:46:49.220\n Steroids.\n\n1:46:49.220 --> 1:46:50.780\n I think somebody's gonna show up to your door.\n\n1:46:50.780 --> 1:46:51.600\n I'm worried.\n\n1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:53.060\n I honestly, I've said enough bad things\n\n1:46:53.060 --> 1:46:56.060\n where I would be a kind of looking over my shoulder\n\n1:46:56.060 --> 1:46:57.060\n if I wanted to do something.\n\n1:46:57.060 --> 1:47:01.260\n I, for one, love the Russians.\n\n1:47:01.260 --> 1:47:02.980\n What about Icarus?\n\n1:47:02.980 --> 1:47:03.820\n How does that make you feel?\n\n1:47:03.820 --> 1:47:04.660\n What about it?\n\n1:47:04.660 --> 1:47:05.480\n It's fake news.\n\n1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:06.320\n Oh, really?\n\n1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:07.160\n I'm just kidding.\n\n1:47:07.160 --> 1:47:07.980\n It's propaganda?\n\n1:47:07.980 --> 1:47:08.820\n Maybe it is.\n\n1:47:08.820 --> 1:47:09.660\n I don't know.\n\n1:47:09.660 --> 1:47:10.480\n I don't know what it is anymore.\n\n1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:11.320\n Maybe it is.\n\n1:47:11.320 --> 1:47:12.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:12.160 --> 1:47:13.060\n You know, it's troublesome, man.\n\n1:47:13.060 --> 1:47:15.080\n I hate cheating in all of its forms.\n\n1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:20.220\n Any other like recaps from the Olympics of 2020 Tokyo\n\n1:47:20.220 --> 1:47:21.140\n that stood out to you?\n\n1:47:21.140 --> 1:47:21.960\n Gable Stephenson?\n\n1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:22.800\n Like anything like that?\n\n1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:23.620\n Gable's great.\n\n1:47:23.620 --> 1:47:24.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:24.460 --> 1:47:26.780\n No, I think America's coming to the point\n\n1:47:26.780 --> 1:47:28.020\n where we're gonna compete with Russia\n\n1:47:28.020 --> 1:47:29.020\n every single year in wrestling,\n\n1:47:29.020 --> 1:47:30.900\n which obviously, you know,\n\n1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:36.260\n long, long time ago, many, many years ago we were great.\n\n1:47:36.260 --> 1:47:39.540\n And then kind of after that Soviet Union period,\n\n1:47:39.540 --> 1:47:41.820\n I think there was a lot of poverty in that area.\n\n1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:43.540\n And that kind of led the wrestling team\n\n1:47:43.540 --> 1:47:44.820\n going down a little bit.\n\n1:47:44.820 --> 1:47:47.620\n And then obviously a lot of those regions,\n\n1:47:47.620 --> 1:47:51.060\n the way they found oil and gas in the Caspian Sea, I believe.\n\n1:47:51.060 --> 1:47:54.020\n And they've been really kind of on the upswing\n\n1:47:54.020 --> 1:47:54.860\n for the last 20 years.\n\n1:47:54.860 --> 1:47:58.020\n And now America really, since 2012,\n\n1:47:58.020 --> 1:47:59.340\n has been on the upswing in wrestling.\n\n1:47:59.340 --> 1:48:02.780\n And we're kind of really competing with them.\n\n1:48:02.780 --> 1:48:04.900\n And they're not sending a couple of their best guys.\n\n1:48:04.900 --> 1:48:06.860\n So for those who don't know,\n\n1:48:06.860 --> 1:48:08.580\n the Olympics moved back a year.\n\n1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:11.300\n So they are hosting the 2021 World Championships,\n\n1:48:11.300 --> 1:48:12.780\n despite the fact that we just had the Olympics\n\n1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:13.620\n two months ago.\n\n1:48:13.620 --> 1:48:15.620\n So it's happening next week in Oslo, Norway.\n\n1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:18.300\n So like Russia's not sending their number one at 57\n\n1:48:18.300 --> 1:48:19.700\n and their number one at 65.\n\n1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:23.540\n So it's like, America's probably gonna win, I think.\n\n1:48:23.540 --> 1:48:24.980\n I don't wanna guarantee anything,\n\n1:48:24.980 --> 1:48:26.300\n but there's a really good chance of it.\n\n1:48:26.300 --> 1:48:28.980\n Is Dave Taylor, all of those guys, competing?\n\n1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:31.620\n America gave any of the Olympians that medaled\n\n1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:33.460\n the opportunity to not even have to wrestle off.\n\n1:48:33.460 --> 1:48:34.460\n They just got to keep the spot\n\n1:48:34.460 --> 1:48:36.660\n since it was two months later if they medaled.\n\n1:48:36.660 --> 1:48:38.860\n So the only one who's not is Gable.\n\n1:48:38.860 --> 1:48:40.020\n Gable's moving on.\n\n1:48:40.020 --> 1:48:41.740\n We have a pretty good guy behind him.\n\n1:48:41.740 --> 1:48:44.180\n Nick Wisniewski is a world medalist.\n\n1:48:44.180 --> 1:48:47.180\n But then he's, so Burrell's filled in the 79 spot.\n\n1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:49.140\n Jayden Cox filled in the 92 spot,\n\n1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:50.780\n who's a world champion also.\n\n1:48:50.780 --> 1:48:52.100\n So we have a pretty good squad.\n\n1:48:52.100 --> 1:48:54.340\n A hell of a team. Pretty good squad, yeah.\n\n1:48:54.340 --> 1:48:56.420\n Pretty good squad. Pretty happy.\n\n1:48:56.420 --> 1:48:59.380\n So given your run in Bellator in one championship,\n\n1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:03.060\n that was like one of the most dominant runs in MMA.\n\n1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:06.300\n What would you say was like key to your dominance\n\n1:49:06.300 --> 1:49:08.860\n in that long undefeated streak?\n\n1:49:08.860 --> 1:49:12.180\n Huh, probably consistency would be one.\n\n1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:16.580\n The fact that I just, I lived and trained the same way\n\n1:49:16.580 --> 1:49:17.900\n no matter where my life was,\n\n1:49:17.900 --> 1:49:18.900\n whereas a lot of fighters,\n\n1:49:18.900 --> 1:49:20.900\n once they start making money for the first time,\n\n1:49:20.900 --> 1:49:22.860\n they have all these obligations and they travel\n\n1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:24.740\n and they really enjoy making money.\n\n1:49:24.740 --> 1:49:27.940\n And that's kind of why some of them fall off.\n\n1:49:27.940 --> 1:49:29.340\n So you had like the same process,\n\n1:49:29.340 --> 1:49:31.380\n like the same camp. Yeah, I stayed at my house.\n\n1:49:31.380 --> 1:49:33.620\n I didn't vacation, yeah, everything.\n\n1:49:33.620 --> 1:49:37.500\n Just, you know, and so that was a big part of it.\n\n1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:40.220\n Obviously the style thing is like, no one could,\n\n1:49:40.220 --> 1:49:43.260\n there was only a few people who could stop my style.\n\n1:49:44.940 --> 1:49:46.780\n And I think I continue to get better\n\n1:49:46.780 --> 1:49:48.060\n as a mixed martial artist.\n\n1:49:48.060 --> 1:49:53.060\n And I wasn't as innovative in mixed martial arts,\n\n1:49:53.260 --> 1:49:56.100\n but there was a handful of things that I innovated,\n\n1:49:56.100 --> 1:49:58.260\n you know, specifically in the top position\n\n1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:00.860\n where I spent a lot of time where it was just like,\n\n1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:02.780\n there was just, once I got on top of you,\n\n1:50:02.780 --> 1:50:03.860\n it was like in a spider web\n\n1:50:03.860 --> 1:50:05.700\n and there was just kind of no way out.\n\n1:50:05.700 --> 1:50:08.500\n You know, you never felt the certain things I was doing.\n\n1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:11.900\n And so people just, they gave up eventually.\n\n1:50:11.900 --> 1:50:14.820\n How's the level of wrestling in MMA would you say?\n\n1:50:14.820 --> 1:50:19.540\n So I saw somewhere like champions,\n\n1:50:19.540 --> 1:50:22.780\n the most popular martial art for current UFC champions\n\n1:50:22.780 --> 1:50:24.380\n are all wrestling.\n\n1:50:24.380 --> 1:50:27.140\n So we just lost a bunch of the belts.\n\n1:50:27.140 --> 1:50:29.380\n Wrestling is a sport, right?\n\n1:50:29.380 --> 1:50:30.540\n But yeah, at one point we had,\n\n1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:32.740\n I think it was eight of nine maybe\n\n1:50:32.740 --> 1:50:34.660\n or something to that effect.\n\n1:50:34.660 --> 1:50:36.860\n And I think it's not just wrestling,\n\n1:50:36.860 --> 1:50:39.700\n not just the actual martial art of wrestling\n\n1:50:39.700 --> 1:50:44.180\n that contributes to our success in mixed martial arts,\n\n1:50:44.180 --> 1:50:46.580\n but other things like the way we're systemized.\n\n1:50:46.580 --> 1:50:49.100\n So most kids who have all this have went through\n\n1:50:49.100 --> 1:50:50.700\n the high school program and the college program\n\n1:50:50.700 --> 1:50:51.900\n and they know how to show up on time\n\n1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:53.200\n and they know how to work hard.\n\n1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:56.900\n So when they go to ATT or AKA or wherever,\n\n1:50:56.900 --> 1:50:58.060\n they know how to show up on time\n\n1:50:58.060 --> 1:50:58.900\n and they know how to work hard\n\n1:50:58.900 --> 1:51:00.720\n and that's gonna get you a really long way.\n\n1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:01.940\n Just those two things, right?\n\n1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:03.900\n Not even the techniques, it's just the discipline.\n\n1:51:03.900 --> 1:51:04.740\n Those things.\n\n1:51:04.740 --> 1:51:06.100\n Then I think you throw on top of that the fact\n\n1:51:06.100 --> 1:51:10.140\n that most of us have competed 1500 to 2000 times,\n\n1:51:10.140 --> 1:51:12.300\n probably by the time we get to 20 something,\n\n1:51:12.300 --> 1:51:13.500\n like that's a huge advantage too.\n\n1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:15.460\n Most of these other people from other disciplines\n\n1:51:15.460 --> 1:51:18.220\n maybe have competed 100, if that, right?\n\n1:51:18.220 --> 1:51:20.300\n So we have this competitive process down\n\n1:51:20.300 --> 1:51:23.140\n really, really, really, really well.\n\n1:51:23.140 --> 1:51:24.100\n Plus the weight cut.\n\n1:51:24.100 --> 1:51:24.940\n The weight cut.\n\n1:51:24.940 --> 1:51:27.380\n There's all these things that factor into it.\n\n1:51:27.380 --> 1:51:29.400\n I think the fact that we're really open minded,\n\n1:51:29.400 --> 1:51:32.300\n I think if you would, I don't wanna pick on jiu jitsu again,\n\n1:51:32.300 --> 1:51:35.000\n but how many jiu jitsu guys have became\n\n1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:36.440\n highly proficient in wrestling\n\n1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:37.740\n versus how many wrestling guys\n\n1:51:37.740 --> 1:51:39.900\n have became highly proficient in jiu jitsu?\n\n1:51:39.900 --> 1:51:41.980\n I think that number swings one way\n\n1:51:41.980 --> 1:51:44.540\n and not that much the other way, you know?\n\n1:51:44.540 --> 1:51:48.260\n So we're open to adapting and learning\n\n1:51:48.260 --> 1:51:52.020\n and for some reason, like jiu jitsu people,\n\n1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:54.020\n how many of them have got high level wrestling?\n\n1:51:54.020 --> 1:51:57.460\n Or even mediocre wrestling, the number's really small.\n\n1:51:57.460 --> 1:52:00.020\n They refuse to, it's really frustrating.\n\n1:52:00.020 --> 1:52:01.020\n Why won't they do this?\n\n1:52:01.020 --> 1:52:03.140\n This is obviously a part of it.\n\n1:52:03.140 --> 1:52:04.580\n I don't wanna pick on specific guys,\n\n1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:06.180\n but there's certain guys in the history of MMA\n\n1:52:06.180 --> 1:52:08.620\n where you're like, listen, man.\n\n1:52:08.620 --> 1:52:10.740\n I mean, Damian Maia, who was my last fight,\n\n1:52:10.740 --> 1:52:12.380\n is a great example of somebody who actually\n\n1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:15.040\n did get proficient in wrestling, right?\n\n1:52:15.040 --> 1:52:16.720\n But there's some of these jiu jitsu guys who's like,\n\n1:52:16.720 --> 1:52:18.620\n if you just got on top, you would submit him.\n\n1:52:18.620 --> 1:52:20.460\n Why can't you learn a freaking takedown?\n\n1:52:20.460 --> 1:52:23.700\n Like, holy moly, just learn how to take someone down.\n\n1:52:23.700 --> 1:52:26.040\n Once you get them down, they will not get up\n\n1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:26.940\n and you win the fight.\n\n1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:28.380\n Like, it's so easy, you know?\n\n1:52:28.380 --> 1:52:29.300\n But they refuse.\n\n1:52:29.300 --> 1:52:30.520\n How complicated is that journey?\n\n1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:33.460\n So like Donaher that you mentioned, Craig Jones,\n\n1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:36.820\n they're big on wrestling as part of jiu jitsu now.\n\n1:52:36.820 --> 1:52:38.840\n Like wrestling, not just on the feet,\n\n1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:41.220\n but wrestling from the bottom coming up\n\n1:52:41.220 --> 1:52:42.940\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:52:42.940 --> 1:52:46.420\n So how difficult is that whole skill set, would you say,\n\n1:52:46.420 --> 1:52:48.680\n for a jiu jitsu person to learn?\n\n1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:49.520\n Not that hard.\n\n1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:50.780\n If they really put their mind to it.\n\n1:52:50.780 --> 1:52:52.660\n Cause they already like, when you grapple,\n\n1:52:52.660 --> 1:52:54.140\n and this is any grappling art,\n\n1:52:54.140 --> 1:52:56.820\n like there's a certain part of it that you kind of get\n\n1:52:56.820 --> 1:52:59.340\n and it can, it might not be the exact same thing,\n\n1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:00.740\n but you understand how your body moves\n\n1:53:00.740 --> 1:53:02.100\n and how to feel certain pressures\n\n1:53:02.100 --> 1:53:04.980\n and you can adapt yourself pretty quickly, you know?\n\n1:53:04.980 --> 1:53:07.420\n So I don't think, I think there's a certain level\n\n1:53:07.420 --> 1:53:09.620\n of stubbornness where they didn't want to,\n\n1:53:09.620 --> 1:53:12.700\n certain people didn't want to do it for whatever reason.\n\n1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:16.140\n I think a lot of times in MMA, it's the I'm so macho,\n\n1:53:16.140 --> 1:53:17.780\n I can stand and bang thing, you know,\n\n1:53:17.780 --> 1:53:21.060\n where they want to show how macho they are.\n\n1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:24.060\n But yeah, that was a frustrating one that they,\n\n1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:26.220\n there's a lot of wrestlers who became highly proficient\n\n1:53:26.220 --> 1:53:28.500\n in jiu jitsu and really adapted\n\n1:53:28.500 --> 1:53:29.620\n and it doesn't go the other way.\n\n1:53:29.620 --> 1:53:31.820\n And then I guess the other thing there too is\n\n1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:35.140\n they can both steal from each other, right?\n\n1:53:35.140 --> 1:53:38.780\n As any martial art can steal from another.\n\n1:53:38.780 --> 1:53:40.460\n And like, I feel like jiu jitsu\n\n1:53:40.460 --> 1:53:42.260\n didn't do enough stealing from wrestling.\n\n1:53:42.260 --> 1:53:44.020\n Like they should have looked at all the wrestling possible\n\n1:53:44.020 --> 1:53:47.460\n and said, well, why don't we steal that and that and that?\n\n1:53:47.460 --> 1:53:48.980\n You know, and like, hey, let's take that over.\n\n1:53:48.980 --> 1:53:52.280\n And maybe we'd make a little tweak because it's different,\n\n1:53:52.280 --> 1:53:53.900\n but there's something we can definitely use there.\n\n1:53:53.900 --> 1:53:57.220\n So like in wrestling, for example,\n\n1:53:57.220 --> 1:53:59.660\n you know there's a one arm guillotine in jiu jitsu, right?\n\n1:53:59.660 --> 1:54:01.700\n Okay, so there's a move called, well, it's got a hundred,\n\n1:54:01.700 --> 1:54:03.060\n I mean, it's like the oldest move in wrestling\n\n1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:04.120\n because it's what they did, the cows,\n\n1:54:04.120 --> 1:54:05.300\n where they go around the chin and they throw them\n\n1:54:05.300 --> 1:54:07.420\n on the back, how do we call that one?\n\n1:54:07.420 --> 1:54:08.260\n I don't know.\n\n1:54:08.260 --> 1:54:11.220\n Okay, sorry, did you just ask me what I call that one?\n\n1:54:11.220 --> 1:54:12.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:12.060 --> 1:54:14.780\n Would you take a cow and grab it by the neck,\n\n1:54:14.780 --> 1:54:15.620\n throw it to the side?\n\n1:54:15.620 --> 1:54:17.340\n No, but in wrestling, in wrestling.\n\n1:54:17.340 --> 1:54:18.380\n I don't know.\n\n1:54:18.380 --> 1:54:19.220\n Okay, we call it that.\n\n1:54:19.220 --> 1:54:20.260\n Are you putting it under?\n\n1:54:20.260 --> 1:54:21.660\n Yeah, so you can grab their chin\n\n1:54:21.660 --> 1:54:22.820\n and then you go under their arm\n\n1:54:22.820 --> 1:54:23.660\n and then throw them on their back.\n\n1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:24.700\n Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah.\n\n1:54:24.700 --> 1:54:26.460\n Yeah, so we call that the honey badger,\n\n1:54:26.460 --> 1:54:28.380\n but it's got different names,\n\n1:54:28.380 --> 1:54:30.380\n wherever you go, it's got different names.\n\n1:54:30.380 --> 1:54:34.720\n So I would always, I would say like pre Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:37.360\n I was average at it, like I could do it,\n\n1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:39.760\n but against good people, you'd never get it for,\n\n1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:42.520\n because they would get the back of their head up\n\n1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:44.140\n and they were too strong where you couldn't collapse them\n\n1:54:44.140 --> 1:54:45.200\n by going over their neck, right?\n\n1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:46.680\n Because the forces weren't right.\n\n1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:48.680\n So then in Jiu Jitsu, you learn the one arm gi team\n\n1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:51.280\n where you grab their chin and this is more of running along\n\n1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:53.620\n the side of their head and then you go here\n\n1:54:53.620 --> 1:54:55.760\n and you choke them, right?\n\n1:54:55.760 --> 1:54:58.060\n Much more efficient way to move their head\n\n1:54:58.060 --> 1:55:00.240\n because the fulcrum is way down here\n\n1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:02.960\n and their head can move into that, right?\n\n1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:06.320\n So once I learned that in Jiu Jitsu, I'm like, wait,\n\n1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:07.880\n I can do this in wrestling.\n\n1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:10.100\n So now once I learn how to grab their chin the right way\n\n1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:12.560\n and I do the honey badger, no one ever gets out.\n\n1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:14.720\n I just had to steal that Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:16.520\n put it in wrestling and boom, there we go.\n\n1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:18.740\n But very few people steal any direction,\n\n1:55:18.740 --> 1:55:19.880\n that takes creativity.\n\n1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:20.720\n Really?\n\n1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:21.540\n And open mindedness.\n\n1:55:21.540 --> 1:55:22.380\n It's so easy because it's already done,\n\n1:55:22.380 --> 1:55:23.720\n you just gotta steal it.\n\n1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:27.160\n I mean, same with Judo, if you're a gi Jiu Jitsu person,\n\n1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:32.160\n there's so much stuff in Judo that's ripe for the stealing\n\n1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:37.680\n because Judo is much more emphasizes explosive moves\n\n1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.240\n on the transition, which is something Jiu Jitsu does not do.\n\n1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:43.080\n Because you have some.\n\n1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:44.120\n You mean from the take down to.\n\n1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:45.880\n From the take down, but also just in general,\n\n1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:49.040\n just in the transition, the concept of transition,\n\n1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:53.680\n the Jiu Jitsu is very much about we're in this position,\n\n1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:56.680\n then we're in this position, then we're in this position.\n\n1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:01.680\n The Judo is much more in when there's chaos of any kind.\n\n1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:04.440\n That's when you need to strike.\n\n1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:06.840\n And to learn that, I mean, that's why people like\n\n1:56:06.840 --> 1:56:09.680\n Travis Stevens and Judoka, when they go to Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:10.520\n they can dominate.\n\n1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:13.680\n But Jiu Jitsu people should steal that.\n\n1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:14.880\n They're too stubborn.\n\n1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:17.480\n Yeah, but so is every, wrestlers are stubborn too.\n\n1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:21.160\n No way, there would never be any stubborn wrestlers.\n\n1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:23.980\n Well, I mean, I was surprised, all these coaches,\n\n1:56:23.980 --> 1:56:27.760\n John Smith, Dan Gabel, they don't really have interest\n\n1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:29.740\n in MMA or Jiu Jitsu and so on.\n\n1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:33.120\n But you would think somebody like a John Smith\n\n1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:36.720\n would like put on a white belt and roll around.\n\n1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:39.400\n Yeah, I think he's just too focused on, you know.\n\n1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:40.240\n Well, he's a coach.\n\n1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:41.720\n Well, he's a coach and what he's doing.\n\n1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:45.240\n Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you take him when he's younger,\n\n1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:46.080\n he would have a lot of fun.\n\n1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:47.140\n We actually have a really good wrestler\n\n1:56:47.140 --> 1:56:48.920\n making his MMA debut tomorrow.\n\n1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:49.920\n I don't know if you, Bo Nickel,\n\n1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:51.900\n I'm sure you've heard of him, very high level.\n\n1:56:51.900 --> 1:56:54.520\n I think he's gonna have a lot of success.\n\n1:56:54.520 --> 1:56:57.520\n I mean, some people might say that like Jiu Jitsu\n\n1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:01.440\n makes you a little comfortable being in your back\n\n1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:03.920\n and for a wrestler, that could be like really bad.\n\n1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:05.080\n I hate that take.\n\n1:57:05.080 --> 1:57:07.320\n Yeah, but that's the Dan Gabel take.\n\n1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:09.800\n It's so stupid, it's so stupid.\n\n1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:12.160\n For God's sakes, we know the fucking rules.\n\n1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:13.800\n Just, in wrestling, you don't go to your back.\n\n1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:16.240\n In Jiu Jitsu, you can, it's like, whatever.\n\n1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:17.080\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:19.760\n But like, so Jiu Jitsu, for example,\n\n1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:22.320\n so I coached, when I was at Rufus, I coached the wrestling\n\n1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:25.840\n for a long, I don't know, three, four, five years.\n\n1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:28.080\n So I've been taking a Jiu Jitsu guy\n\n1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:29.820\n and teaching them a wrestling technique\n\n1:57:29.820 --> 1:57:32.480\n where you needed to use your feet.\n\n1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:35.480\n To teach a Jiu Jitsu guy, so easy, so simple,\n\n1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:37.120\n because they already understand the concept,\n\n1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:39.440\n butterfly guard, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, right?\n\n1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:42.540\n To take a wrestler who's never done any of it\n\n1:57:42.540 --> 1:57:43.880\n and teach him how to use his feet,\n\n1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:46.280\n oh my God, it's such a beast, it's so hard,\n\n1:57:46.280 --> 1:57:49.060\n because that's not a weapon they're thinking about using.\n\n1:57:49.060 --> 1:57:51.600\n So it's like, we understand the rules.\n\n1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:52.960\n It's like freestyle folks are wrestling.\n\n1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:55.140\n Freestyle, if I'm on the mat, I can lock my hands.\n\n1:57:55.140 --> 1:57:56.400\n You don't see people locking their hands\n\n1:57:56.400 --> 1:57:58.160\n all the time in folk style just because they did freestyle.\n\n1:57:58.160 --> 1:57:59.400\n It's like, they get it.\n\n1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:00.800\n There's a rule, they understand it.\n\n1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:04.040\n So the notion that somehow you come from on your back.\n\n1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:08.660\n But pinning, that's like a, it has a special meaning.\n\n1:58:08.660 --> 1:58:11.280\n Yeah, but I actually think, so Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:16.280\n you don't actually wanna be flat, flat very often, right?\n\n1:58:16.280 --> 1:58:17.760\n You don't wanna be.\n\n1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:18.760\n I always wondered this,\n\n1:58:18.760 --> 1:58:21.920\n because I did a couple of catch wrestling tournaments,\n\n1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:26.240\n and I did, I would put myself in butterfly guard,\n\n1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:28.440\n and I wasn't going against good people,\n\n1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:30.360\n so which is why I was doing all these things.\n\n1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:34.400\n But I wondered if you could create a system of wrestling\n\n1:58:34.400 --> 1:58:37.180\n where you're butterfly guard.\n\n1:58:37.180 --> 1:58:40.220\n So I think that there's a few places where I use it.\n\n1:58:40.220 --> 1:58:41.880\n But so specifically the Elevator Series,\n\n1:58:41.880 --> 1:58:43.040\n which my main series up bottom,\n\n1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:45.380\n it is, it's not butterfly guard.\n\n1:58:45.380 --> 1:58:47.240\n It's a butterfly guard grip with your foot.\n\n1:58:47.240 --> 1:58:50.820\n So I boom, I go here, I catch your leg with my foot,\n\n1:58:50.820 --> 1:58:53.000\n boom, and I elevate you over, right?\n\n1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:54.800\n And then also sometimes,\n\n1:58:56.320 --> 1:58:57.720\n I think Keegan does this too from watching me,\n\n1:58:57.720 --> 1:58:59.400\n but if I get double leg,\n\n1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:02.600\n sometimes if I'm accepting, so freestyle,\n\n1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:03.440\n obviously you're gonna give him points,\n\n1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:05.600\n you're gonna focus on accepting that you've already got me,\n\n1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:09.520\n and as I go down, I'm just gonna butterfly guard you up,\n\n1:59:09.520 --> 1:59:11.620\n and then I'm gonna try to flip my hip back to the mat,\n\n1:59:11.620 --> 1:59:13.820\n and end up in a wizard position.\n\n1:59:13.820 --> 1:59:15.360\n I've used that quite a few times,\n\n1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:17.720\n where it's kind of like a bailout mechanism\n\n1:59:17.720 --> 1:59:20.520\n that gets me back to maybe not a great position,\n\n1:59:20.520 --> 1:59:23.520\n but obviously much better than being taken down.\n\n1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:24.860\n Beautiful. Yeah.\n\n1:59:24.860 --> 1:59:26.920\n Let me ask you quickly about crypto,\n\n1:59:26.920 --> 1:59:30.320\n because you're also, you have a show.\n\n1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:33.760\n You have a lot of interest in cryptocurrency.\n\n1:59:33.760 --> 1:59:36.400\n Why are you interested in cryptocurrency?\n\n1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:38.060\n Is it just a financial investment,\n\n1:59:38.060 --> 1:59:40.880\n or is there a philosophy that attracts you to it?\n\n1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:44.240\n So I, my friend told me about it in 2017.\n\n1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:46.240\n I was actually, I went to, I was,\n\n1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:47.560\n my friend met me in Shanghai.\n\n1:59:47.560 --> 1:59:50.800\n I fought in one championship, and he told me,\n\n1:59:50.800 --> 1:59:54.040\n and the second he told me, I'm like, oh, I'm so in,\n\n1:59:54.040 --> 1:59:56.520\n because I had read Ron Paul and the Fed.\n\n1:59:56.520 --> 1:59:58.720\n I had read, I kind of had an understanding\n\n1:59:58.720 --> 2:00:01.500\n how the Fed is unfair,\n\n2:00:02.400 --> 2:00:03.400\n and so when he told me about crypto,\n\n2:00:03.400 --> 2:00:07.460\n this decentralized system that no one has control over,\n\n2:00:07.460 --> 2:00:09.920\n it just made sense, and so we've had the podcast,\n\n2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:11.920\n to say Michael Saylor on it, and I love the way he says it.\n\n2:00:11.920 --> 2:00:13.600\n It's like, who do you trust more with your money?\n\n2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:16.800\n Do you trust the politicians, or do you trust engineers?\n\n2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:18.240\n I think that's an easy choice.\n\n2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:19.640\n I don't even think, I don't even think\n\n2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:20.480\n I have to think about that.\n\n2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:22.840\n I don't trust politicians, no matter what country they come\n\n2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:26.320\n from, China, America, wherever, I don't trust them.\n\n2:00:26.320 --> 2:00:31.320\n So. So what about in 2017, what was it, Bitcoin?\n\n2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:38.240\n Are you, what do you find, which ones do you find interesting?\n\n2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:39.720\n Yeah. There's all kinds of ideas,\n\n2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:44.640\n there's the more sort of primal mechanism\n\n2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:46.640\n of proof of work and Bitcoin,\n\n2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:48.720\n and then there's smart contracts, ideas,\n\n2:00:48.720 --> 2:00:50.960\n and there's all kinds of innovations\n\n2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:53.240\n across the different points.\n\n2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:55.160\n So I can't say I'm in super deep\n\n2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:57.040\n where I understand the technical components\n\n2:00:57.040 --> 2:00:57.880\n of a lot of them.\n\n2:00:57.880 --> 2:00:59.400\n I understand what Bitcoin can do for people,\n\n2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:02.200\n and so that's probably the one I've focused the most on.\n\n2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:05.560\n And I actually, I think I was talking about,\n\n2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:07.680\n I was trying to convince Michael to talk about Bitcoin\n\n2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:09.960\n because he hates it also, what he did last night.\n\n2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:13.920\n And I think most of the main problems Bitcoin solves,\n\n2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:15.760\n people in America are so American centric,\n\n2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:16.600\n they don't understand it.\n\n2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:18.320\n So like high levels of inflation,\n\n2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:20.280\n that hasn't happened in, it's starting to happen,\n\n2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:21.760\n it hasn't happened in America in a long time, right?\n\n2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:25.600\n But someone in Venezuela is like, oh, I get that, you know,\n\n2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:27.920\n or remittance payments, right?\n\n2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:30.400\n Remittance payments to, you see it.\n\n2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:32.960\n So I saw this in, when I was spending all the time\n\n2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:34.840\n in Singapore, Singapore is obviously\n\n2:01:34.840 --> 2:01:36.560\n a really wealthy country,\n\n2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:39.040\n and so you'd have Indonesian workers or Filipino,\n\n2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:40.920\n and they would all go on Sundays,\n\n2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:42.640\n they would go to these places to ship stuff\n\n2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:44.960\n back to their families and through Western Union,\n\n2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:46.840\n Western Union gouges the shit out of these people.\n\n2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:49.080\n I mean, they're taking eight, 10, 12%\n\n2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:50.560\n of whatever they're sending,\n\n2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:52.920\n then it takes five days and the person's gonna go pick it up,\n\n2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:55.640\n whereas Bitcoin, I could send you Bitcoin\n\n2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:56.720\n person to person, right?\n\n2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.080\n So like American people don't understand that.\n\n2:01:59.080 --> 2:02:01.480\n American people don't really understand the unbanked, right?\n\n2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:03.240\n A decent portion of the world is unbanked,\n\n2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:04.560\n they don't have access to it.\n\n2:02:04.560 --> 2:02:07.560\n And a much, much, much smaller portion of the world\n\n2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:08.720\n doesn't have access to internet.\n\n2:02:08.720 --> 2:02:11.720\n So if I can put a mobile wallet on your phone,\n\n2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:13.960\n and we can send money person to person.\n\n2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:15.000\n So there's a whole bunch of those problems\n\n2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:16.720\n where Americans don't really think about\n\n2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:19.080\n that are really obvious that this solves.\n\n2:02:20.120 --> 2:02:21.440\n So I think that's a key one,\n\n2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:24.400\n obviously the fact that the value goes up\n\n2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:25.840\n is really outstanding also,\n\n2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:29.800\n but if you look at it, I got in in 2017,\n\n2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:31.840\n so I got to watch it go up.\n\n2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:34.160\n I didn't sell shit at the top, really stupid.\n\n2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:35.720\n And then the majority of my time\n\n2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:37.480\n was spent through the bear market.\n\n2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:39.880\n And so I had to love it for the principles that it provided,\n\n2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:42.680\n not the fact that I actually lost money in the beginning\n\n2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:45.680\n and now I'm way up, but yeah.\n\n2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:46.520\n So I think that.\n\n2:02:46.520 --> 2:02:47.360\n And you're just holding.\n\n2:02:47.360 --> 2:02:48.280\n Just holding.\n\n2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:50.200\n I think at the top of this bull market,\n\n2:02:50.200 --> 2:02:53.840\n I'll probably sell a very small portion, just to.\n\n2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:56.000\n So you mean like right now there's a bull market?\n\n2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.000\n Yeah, most people think say in the next three to six months\n\n2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:00.720\n we'll be at the top of the market.\n\n2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:02.560\n And so probably when that happens,\n\n2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:04.760\n I'll probably sell a little bit.\n\n2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:06.280\n You gotta hodl it, Ben.\n\n2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:07.120\n You gotta hodl.\n\n2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:07.960\n Well, yeah.\n\n2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:08.920\n So here's what I am.\n\n2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:12.640\n So one of my podcast cohosts, he's like super rich,\n\n2:03:12.640 --> 2:03:13.800\n like super rich.\n\n2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:16.120\n So he has lost touch with the every man.\n\n2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:19.080\n So here's my argument to him, it's really simple.\n\n2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:20.960\n And listen, I'm doing well for myself in life,\n\n2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:24.440\n but if say someone buys a Bitcoin, right?\n\n2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:27.080\n One Bitcoin at $5,000, which it was last year.\n\n2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:31.880\n And this Bitcoin goes from $5,000 to $200,000,\n\n2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:34.200\n which is right around what a lot of people think\n\n2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:35.600\n the peak is going to be.\n\n2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:36.840\n They bought one Bitcoin.\n\n2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:39.600\n And they're living in a $200,000 house.\n\n2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:42.360\n So to take half of that, right?\n\n2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:44.160\n You started with $5,000 of the Bitcoin,\n\n2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:47.400\n to sell half a Bitcoin for $100,000\n\n2:03:47.400 --> 2:03:49.720\n and pay off your house, your remaining house payment,\n\n2:03:49.720 --> 2:03:51.080\n that's life changing to someone.\n\n2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:52.040\n It really is.\n\n2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:53.720\n And so you still have a Bitcoin,\n\n2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:54.880\n so if Bitcoin goes to a million,\n\n2:03:54.880 --> 2:03:56.520\n you're still gonna have half a million,\n\n2:03:56.520 --> 2:03:58.120\n and you're gonna feel really, really rich\n\n2:03:58.120 --> 2:03:59.120\n with that half a million dollars\n\n2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:02.600\n because you bought it for effing $2,500, you know?\n\n2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:06.120\n So yeah, so I would encourage anyone who's not uber rich\n\n2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:08.920\n to, if you have huge profits, take a little bit of them\n\n2:04:08.920 --> 2:04:10.560\n because it could change your life.\n\n2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:14.760\n And if you hold it and it goes down,\n\n2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:16.280\n you're going to feel the pain of that.\n\n2:04:16.280 --> 2:04:19.800\n Like sometimes if you're more constrained financially,\n\n2:04:19.800 --> 2:04:21.440\n it's much more psychologically difficult\n\n2:04:21.440 --> 2:04:22.920\n to ride the ups and downs.\n\n2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:23.760\n Yeah, it is for sure.\n\n2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:26.480\n So they have these really fascinating things in Bitcoin.\n\n2:04:26.480 --> 2:04:29.960\n Actually, one of the main guys on our podcast,\n\n2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:31.560\n it's called Onchain Metrics.\n\n2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:34.880\n So all wallet transactions are visible, you know?\n\n2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:37.360\n And so they have all these fun categories.\n\n2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:39.800\n So I think you said you don't like numbers, but.\n\n2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:40.640\n I like numbers.\n\n2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:41.480\n Oh, you love numbers.\n\n2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:42.760\n So I love numbers also.\n\n2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:44.160\n So they have all these different categories.\n\n2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:49.160\n Like you can see how long a wallet has held a Bitcoin,\n\n2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:51.640\n or how many Bitcoins are in a certain wallet.\n\n2:04:51.640 --> 2:04:54.120\n And so what they've seen during the downturn,\n\n2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:55.680\n so April it kind of peaked and went down,\n\n2:04:55.680 --> 2:04:58.960\n is that the whales are still buying.\n\n2:04:58.960 --> 2:05:01.840\n So whales, people of a thousand or more are still buying.\n\n2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:04.000\n They've said the main group of sellers\n\n2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.280\n is the ones who held it from zero to three months.\n\n2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:07.720\n So like they don't have money.\n\n2:05:07.720 --> 2:05:09.280\n They bought it because they thought it was going up.\n\n2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:11.600\n And I was like, oh shit, I got to sell it, right?\n\n2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:13.280\n Whereas anyone who's held it for a long time\n\n2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:15.360\n is generally still holding on to it.\n\n2:05:15.360 --> 2:05:16.200\n That's interesting.\n\n2:05:16.200 --> 2:05:19.160\n That's a good indicator, right, for the whole space.\n\n2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:20.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:21.720\n Well, let me ask you for some advice.\n\n2:05:21.720 --> 2:05:24.120\n You've been through one heck of a career,\n\n2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:25.520\n one heck of a life.\n\n2:05:25.520 --> 2:05:28.520\n What advice would you give to a young person today?\n\n2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:32.520\n Well, in wrestling, I think wrestling's really a microcosm\n\n2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:33.800\n of what your life's going to be.\n\n2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:36.520\n And that's why one of the things I stress to kids is like,\n\n2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:38.080\n if we can go through this now and figure,\n\n2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:39.520\n I have a couple of kids who are struggling\n\n2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:40.360\n with certain things right now.\n\n2:05:40.360 --> 2:05:42.800\n If you can figure it out this now in wrestling,\n\n2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:44.200\n it's going to be a lot better to figure it out now\n\n2:05:44.200 --> 2:05:46.120\n and get over this mental hump\n\n2:05:46.120 --> 2:05:49.280\n than when you're 32 and you have two kids, right,\n\n2:05:49.280 --> 2:05:50.920\n and your job's not going well.\n\n2:05:50.920 --> 2:05:51.760\n It's going to be a lot worse.\n\n2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:52.840\n It's going to be a lot more painful then.\n\n2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:54.720\n Let's fucking figure it out now.\n\n2:05:54.720 --> 2:05:56.280\n So a lot of these things, a lot of these lessons\n\n2:05:56.280 --> 2:05:57.360\n we can learn from wrestling,\n\n2:05:57.360 --> 2:06:00.680\n whether it's persistence or perseverance or work ethic,\n\n2:06:00.680 --> 2:06:01.520\n or, you know what I said,\n\n2:06:01.520 --> 2:06:03.640\n wrestlers show up on time and they work hard, right?\n\n2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:05.920\n These things, if we can learn these things at an early age,\n\n2:06:05.920 --> 2:06:08.280\n those are general, those characteristics\n\n2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:10.720\n will generally carry on throughout our life.\n\n2:06:10.720 --> 2:06:11.560\n And those are the things\n\n2:06:11.560 --> 2:06:12.600\n that are going to make us really successful.\n\n2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:15.840\n So, you know, I would say find a great coach,\n\n2:06:15.840 --> 2:06:17.080\n someone who's going to spend a lot of time\n\n2:06:17.080 --> 2:06:18.080\n and put a lot of time into you\n\n2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:19.440\n and make sure they have a lot of wisdom\n\n2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:22.440\n and steal all the wisdom that you can from them.\n\n2:06:22.440 --> 2:06:25.680\n And then if you can be successful at one thing,\n\n2:06:25.680 --> 2:06:27.520\n generally whatever that recipe was\n\n2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:29.840\n that took you to be successful at that,\n\n2:06:29.840 --> 2:06:31.760\n apply it to everything else, right?\n\n2:06:31.760 --> 2:06:32.720\n Apply it to the rest of your life.\n\n2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:36.040\n Apply it to getting a wife that you enjoy.\n\n2:06:36.040 --> 2:06:38.640\n Apply it to living in a place you want to live,\n\n2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:40.400\n doing a job you want to do, right?\n\n2:06:40.400 --> 2:06:42.440\n There's so many possibilities\n\n2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:44.280\n and you just have to be bold enough\n\n2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:45.400\n to go take those chances.\n\n2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:47.560\n It's interesting because early on in life\n\n2:06:47.560 --> 2:06:49.960\n is when you have much more time.\n\n2:06:49.960 --> 2:06:53.040\n People don't realize it's time to learn the lessons.\n\n2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:55.640\n Like somehow later in life,\n\n2:06:55.640 --> 2:06:57.440\n you get busier, responsibilities\n\n2:06:57.440 --> 2:06:58.560\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:00.200\n Like high school is a magical time.\n\n2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:01.040\n You're in college.\n\n2:07:01.040 --> 2:07:01.880\n You're in college, yeah, for sure.\n\n2:07:01.880 --> 2:07:05.800\n Yeah, there's so much time to learn.\n\n2:07:05.800 --> 2:07:07.120\n Well, you don't even have kids yet.\n\n2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:09.480\n Yeah, I don't have kids, but that still fills up.\n\n2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:10.840\n Well, no, I'm purpose.\n\n2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:12.800\n And I did something that many people\n\n2:07:12.800 --> 2:07:13.800\n don't seem to be able to do.\n\n2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:15.840\n I walked away from a lot of responsibilities.\n\n2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:17.240\n How?\n\n2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:18.760\n By saying goodbye.\n\n2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:19.640\n Oh, okay.\n\n2:07:19.640 --> 2:07:23.280\n But meetings, everybody around me at MIT\n\n2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:25.760\n was like meetings fill the day.\n\n2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:27.480\n And then you have more projects\n\n2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:30.400\n and you do a great job and you become successful.\n\n2:07:30.400 --> 2:07:32.040\n And then the more meetings fill the day\n\n2:07:32.040 --> 2:07:35.360\n and more responsibilities as opposed to like,\n\n2:07:35.360 --> 2:07:38.920\n wait a minute, do I want to be involved in all these things?\n\n2:07:38.920 --> 2:07:42.480\n And instead, do I want to find one or two things\n\n2:07:42.480 --> 2:07:43.960\n to really focus on?\n\n2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:46.000\n And that's what I choose.\n\n2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:49.000\n But that becomes harder and harder\n\n2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:50.360\n and harder as you get older.\n\n2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:53.560\n No, I mean, I'm sure, and also the more success you have,\n\n2:07:53.560 --> 2:07:56.240\n you become sought after other places too.\n\n2:07:56.240 --> 2:07:57.440\n I'm sure that's happening with you.\n\n2:07:57.440 --> 2:08:00.400\n And it's hard to keep saying no, no, no.\n\n2:08:00.400 --> 2:08:01.280\n Saying no is hard.\n\n2:08:01.280 --> 2:08:03.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:04.760\n You're known for roasting people\n\n2:08:04.760 --> 2:08:08.680\n with a single boom roasted line.\n\n2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:11.400\n So any ideas, maybe you want to mention malice,\n\n2:08:11.400 --> 2:08:14.920\n but any ideas come to mind when you look at me?\n\n2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:17.320\n Man, you know what?\n\n2:08:17.320 --> 2:08:19.040\n If I was going to boom roast someone,\n\n2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:21.240\n I would want to kind of like research their career\n\n2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:23.280\n and dissect them and figure out their biggest negatives.\n\n2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:24.120\n Get to the core.\n\n2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:25.920\n And I didn't have that notion with you.\n\n2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:28.320\n I figured, you know, I got a general sense of,\n\n2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:30.680\n okay, he's really successful, he's super sharp.\n\n2:08:30.680 --> 2:08:32.800\n He's really interested in some really interesting things.\n\n2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:34.160\n I bet we'll have a great conversation,\n\n2:08:34.160 --> 2:08:36.840\n but I had no intention to roast you.\n\n2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:37.680\n Yeah, there you go.\n\n2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:38.520\n What about malice?\n\n2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:39.720\n You had dinner with him last night.\n\n2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:40.880\n Hmm, for him.\n\n2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:43.280\n Oh man.\n\n2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:46.320\n How'd you get to know him, by the way?\n\n2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:47.600\n Just Twitter.\n\n2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:49.600\n Where's the most magical place in the world, right?\n\n2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:51.360\n I always tell people it's the greatest source of information\n\n2:08:51.360 --> 2:08:52.600\n if you know how to use it.\n\n2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:54.840\n Hmm.\n\n2:08:54.840 --> 2:08:56.520\n He's insane on Twitter, actually.\n\n2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:57.360\n He's quite a lot.\n\n2:08:57.360 --> 2:08:58.600\n So I had to unfollow him on Twitter,\n\n2:08:58.600 --> 2:08:59.440\n because he was too much.\n\n2:08:59.440 --> 2:09:00.280\n It was too intense?\n\n2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:01.760\n No, it was too much, it fills up.\n\n2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:03.600\n Like, I want to be able to consume the content.\n\n2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:04.760\n So if I want to see something he says,\n\n2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:06.880\n I can go to his page, right?\n\n2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:08.600\n But it's just too much for my timeline.\n\n2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:10.840\n I want to be able to consume who I follow.\n\n2:09:10.840 --> 2:09:12.160\n So I try to not follow a lot of people,\n\n2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:13.800\n because I want to be able to consume them.\n\n2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:16.000\n And he was too much.\n\n2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.640\n He fights the trolls, which,\n\n2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:20.320\n I don't know why you'd ever fight the trolls.\n\n2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:21.640\n There's just too many of them.\n\n2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:22.760\n Well, he's a troll himself.\n\n2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:25.560\n He's like the big troll fighting the little trolls.\n\n2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:27.120\n He's the king troll.\n\n2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:27.960\n There's a million of them.\n\n2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:30.080\n So even if you kill 100,000,\n\n2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:31.400\n there's still not 100,000 left.\n\n2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:33.120\n You just gotta ignore them.\n\n2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:35.120\n It's like the Nightwalker or whatever.\n\n2:09:35.120 --> 2:09:36.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:39.240\n Well, I'll take it, because you had nothing,\n\n2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:41.920\n you couldn't rose GSP out of respect, too.\n\n2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:43.760\n So I'm just going to take that as a sign of respect.\n\n2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:45.400\n What do you say bad about GSP?\n\n2:09:45.400 --> 2:09:46.960\n Now I try to rose his hair.\n\n2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:48.720\n Like, why are you trying to grow hair now\n\n2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:49.880\n after all these years?\n\n2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:50.920\n He looked good, bald.\n\n2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:53.040\n Everyone loved him with his head shaved.\n\n2:09:53.040 --> 2:09:53.960\n Now it looks kind of strange.\n\n2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:55.080\n Like, why you got hair now?\n\n2:09:55.080 --> 2:09:57.960\n Well, it was one of the more surreal moments of my life.\n\n2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:01.440\n So he was here and he wore a black suit and tie.\n\n2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:03.280\n Oh, really?\n\n2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:04.120\n Yeah, we did the podcast with him,\n\n2:10:04.120 --> 2:10:06.440\n just mirror image of me.\n\n2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:08.600\n And then we also did, I haven't released it yet,\n\n2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:09.880\n but just the video together.\n\n2:10:09.880 --> 2:10:13.160\n And I was doing a martial arts stuff in a suit and tie.\n\n2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:14.240\n That was quite,\n\n2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:18.080\n that was quite, that's like,\n\n2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:21.040\n like certain moments in your life are just like,\n\n2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:22.680\n I can't believe I was part of that.\n\n2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:24.800\n Yeah, with GSP, so yeah,\n\n2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:27.160\n I don't think I have anything to rose him about.\n\n2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:29.680\n I mean, maybe the Matt Serra thing\n\n2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:32.520\n would be the one that you could get him with, you know?\n\n2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:34.200\n I would be really fascinated,\n\n2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:37.920\n like really dig deep from a sports psychology standpoint,\n\n2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:39.640\n because he always talks about how much fear he had\n\n2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:40.920\n when he was competing.\n\n2:10:40.920 --> 2:10:43.960\n And I find that to be interesting because obviously,\n\n2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:46.120\n so it's almost like, to me, it's almost like,\n\n2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:48.880\n was he successful despite that?\n\n2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:50.640\n Not because of that, right?\n\n2:10:50.640 --> 2:10:53.120\n And because anxiety usually leads\n\n2:10:53.120 --> 2:10:55.440\n to really negative performance for the majority of people.\n\n2:10:55.440 --> 2:10:57.400\n And what was it about him\n\n2:10:57.400 --> 2:10:59.800\n that the anxiety wasn't super negative?\n\n2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:00.640\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:02.320\n Like, it's very interesting.\n\n2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:03.160\n I wonder that too.\n\n2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:05.360\n So I have, I wondered that about him,\n\n2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:07.960\n but I have a huge amount of anxiety interacting,\n\n2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:10.960\n especially with people, just about everything, yeah.\n\n2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:13.480\n I wonder if that's helpful or not.\n\n2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:15.200\n It feels like it's very helpful.\n\n2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:17.800\n Well, I think, so okay, I think in two different ways.\n\n2:11:17.800 --> 2:11:20.840\n So I think probably your everyday life, okay,\n\n2:11:20.840 --> 2:11:25.200\n is different than like in a performance or a competition.\n\n2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:27.600\n You have to be like super in the moment\n\n2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:28.800\n of what you're doing.\n\n2:11:28.800 --> 2:11:30.600\n So anything that's pulling you away,\n\n2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:31.920\n like, oh my gosh, you know,\n\n2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:33.760\n for high school kids, right, that coach.\n\n2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.960\n Oh my gosh, that girl's in the stands,\n\n2:11:35.960 --> 2:11:37.720\n and if I get beat, then,\n\n2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:40.560\n and they're actively thinking about this other thing\n\n2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:41.960\n when this is going on.\n\n2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:44.440\n And I need 100% of your focus right here.\n\n2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:47.040\n He's never, I don't think he has anxiety in the ring.\n\n2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:47.880\n That's the point.\n\n2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:50.160\n I think, like, I have the same thing.\n\n2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:53.840\n Like if I have a really high performance thing\n\n2:11:53.840 --> 2:11:55.800\n that I have to do, I don't know,\n\n2:11:55.800 --> 2:11:57.080\n a lecture in front of a lot of people.\n\n2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:58.720\n Yeah, that'd be a great example.\n\n2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:02.040\n That, there's huge amount of anxiety weeks ahead,\n\n2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:03.800\n days ahead, hours ahead.\n\n2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:05.960\n So you have a system to get rid of it then?\n\n2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:07.560\n As you perform. No, maybe,\n\n2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:10.280\n but it's just the body gets rid of it somehow.\n\n2:12:10.280 --> 2:12:11.560\n Yeah, there's not a system.\n\n2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:12.920\n Subconscious system.\n\n2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:14.760\n Yeah, it's self preservation.\n\n2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:15.760\n So you don't actually have anxiety\n\n2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:17.280\n while you're performing.\n\n2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:19.880\n So that's like, so then that problem,\n\n2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:21.920\n somehow that problem has solved itself, right?\n\n2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:24.280\n The problem is when the anxiety is actually happening\n\n2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:26.000\n while the wrestling match is happening,\n\n2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:27.520\n that's the real issue.\n\n2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:30.560\n Yeah, but it like sneaks in there too.\n\n2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:33.000\n That's the difference, you know, MMA and wrestling\n\n2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:37.080\n is there's no breaks in wrestling, right?\n\n2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:39.960\n I guess there is, you can look at the crowd a little bit,\n\n2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:42.400\n like you can look, so maybe,\n\n2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:46.480\n but like the, there's other things we have to perform.\n\n2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:48.360\n Well, there's more breaks, like a lecture,\n\n2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:49.520\n you can catch yourself thinking,\n\n2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:51.640\n like in this conversation, you know,\n\n2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:54.400\n like I've said a bunch of stuff where I think,\n\n2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:55.680\n why the hell did you say that?\n\n2:12:55.680 --> 2:12:57.040\n That's dumb, right?\n\n2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:00.200\n That's the anxiety because there's a pause\n\n2:13:00.200 --> 2:13:02.560\n and that could be, I don't know,\n\n2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:05.240\n I think it just pushes me to be better,\n\n2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:08.160\n but maybe I could be way better if I let go of that.\n\n2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:10.160\n It's scary to think that GSB, if you let go of that,\n\n2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:11.000\n but he didn't.\n\n2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:12.280\n Could he have been better?\n\n2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:14.240\n Or did he ever, did he have a,\n\n2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:17.160\n like you're saying like, you don't necessarily feel those.\n\n2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:19.200\n So I think certain people that I've coached,\n\n2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:21.560\n like they would describe how they would feel\n\n2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:24.160\n literally during the wrestling match, right?\n\n2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:27.080\n And you're saying like during the speech performance,\n\n2:13:27.080 --> 2:13:28.600\n it's mostly gone.\n\n2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:31.520\n And that's interesting to see if like,\n\n2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:32.680\n he talked a lot about that,\n\n2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:35.160\n but if it was all the way somehow gone,\n\n2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:36.960\n and it means he would have a mechanism for it.\n\n2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:38.200\n So like I had a really bad performance\n\n2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:41.120\n my freshman year of high school at nationals,\n\n2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:43.400\n cause I had the ability to be anxious.\n\n2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:44.880\n And one of my coaches talked about like,\n\n2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:48.160\n and a lot of A type personalities are kind of that way,\n\n2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:49.720\n you know, because they're trying to consider\n\n2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:52.000\n all possibilities at the same time.\n\n2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.880\n And while we're actually performing or competing,\n\n2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:57.520\n it's negative to performance, right?\n\n2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:00.640\n So he said he would always leading up to the match\n\n2:14:00.640 --> 2:14:03.520\n within say an hour, his name was talking about fishing.\n\n2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:04.680\n He would get someone to talk about fishing with him\n\n2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:06.280\n because it would stop him thinking about the match\n\n2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:08.000\n and being uber anxious.\n\n2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.360\n So I kind of took it to heart and it really helped me\n\n2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:12.480\n as I would always like have someone to talk to\n\n2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:14.760\n and just goof around about whatever.\n\n2:14:14.760 --> 2:14:16.520\n So I'm not thinking about this thing.\n\n2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:18.320\n And then once I step in, it's time to go.\n\n2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:20.880\n So I didn't have this like anxious buildup.\n\n2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:22.880\n Now it's how for me, I took it away, but like me,\n\n2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:25.520\n you know, like you said, you have a way to get it away,\n\n2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:26.360\n obviously, cause it's there and then it's not.\n\n2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:28.200\n Yeah, I guess so, I guess there's a little tricks\n\n2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:29.040\n you come up with.\n\n2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:30.520\n Yeah, you start thinking about it's not fishing,\n\n2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:32.520\n maybe I should try the fishing thing.\n\n2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:34.320\n I hate fishing, so boring.\n\n2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:37.120\n But maybe it's good to think about that.\n\n2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:40.360\n All right, Ben, this is, like I told you, I'm a big fan.\n\n2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:42.240\n I'm a big fan of your wrestling, your fighting,\n\n2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:44.240\n your personality.\n\n2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:45.200\n Thank you for coming down.\n\n2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:46.160\n Thank you for talking today.\n\n2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:47.000\n Appreciate it.\n\n2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:48.120\n It's a huge honor.\n\n2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:49.880\n Bam, let's go wrestle.\n\n2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:53.480\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ben Askren.\n\n2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:56.240\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n2:14:56.240 --> 2:14:57.640\n in the description.\n\n2:14:57.640 --> 2:14:59.600\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:01.480\n from Muhammad Ali.\n\n2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:05.520\n Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated\n\n2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:08.720\n can reach down to the bottom of his soul\n\n2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:12.000\n and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes\n\n2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.600\n to win when the match is even.\n\n2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:34.600\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
