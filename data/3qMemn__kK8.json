most popular educational YouTube channels\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:10.080\n in the world with over 15 million subscribers\n\n00:10.080 --> 00:13.040\n and over 1.7 billion views.\n\n00:13.040 --> 00:16.160\n His videos often ask and answer questions\n\n00:16.160 --> 00:18.780\n that are both profound and entertaining,\n\n00:18.780 --> 00:21.800\n spanning topics from physics to psychology.\n\n00:21.800 --> 00:23.640\n Popular questions include,\n\n00:23.640 --> 00:25.440\n what if everyone jumped at once?\n\n00:25.440 --> 00:27.680\n Or what if the sun disappeared?\n\n00:27.680 --> 00:29.820\n Or why are things creepy?\n\n00:29.820 --> 00:32.840\n Or what if the earth stopped spinning?\n\n00:32.840 --> 00:34.040\n As part of his channel,\n\n00:34.040 --> 00:36.320\n he created three seasons of Mind Field,\n\n00:36.320 --> 00:38.760\n a series that explored human behavior.\n\n00:38.760 --> 00:41.640\n His curiosity and passion are contagious\n\n00:41.640 --> 00:44.080\n and inspiring to millions of people.\n\n00:44.080 --> 00:45.240\n And so as an educator,\n\n00:45.240 --> 00:47.540\n his impact and contribution to the world\n\n00:47.540 --> 00:49.780\n is truly immeasurable.\n\n00:49.780 --> 00:52.840\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:52.840 --> 00:55.200\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:55.200 --> 00:57.160\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n00:57.160 --> 00:58.600\n support it on Patreon,\n\n00:58.600 --> 01:00.640\n or simply connect with me on Twitter,\n\n01:00.640 --> 01:03.800\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:04.900 --> 01:06.400\n I recently started doing ads\n\n01:06.400 --> 01:08.120\n at the end of the introduction.\n\n01:08.120 --> 01:10.780\n I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode\n\n01:10.780 --> 01:12.740\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n01:12.740 --> 01:14.760\n that break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:14.760 --> 01:16.120\n I hope that works for you\n\n01:16.120 --> 01:19.000\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.500\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:21.500 --> 01:24.000\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:26.560\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n01:26.560 --> 01:28.280\n but you can also use it to buy, sell,\n\n01:28.280 --> 01:30.720\n and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.\n\n01:30.720 --> 01:33.480\n Cash App also has a new investing feature.\n\n01:33.480 --> 01:36.320\n You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,\n\n01:36.320 --> 01:38.280\n no matter what the stock price is.\n\n01:38.280 --> 01:40.880\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n01:40.880 --> 01:44.200\n a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.\n\n01:44.200 --> 01:46.180\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n01:46.180 --> 01:49.120\n to support one of my favorite organizations called First,\n\n01:49.120 --> 01:52.440\n best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.\n\n01:52.440 --> 01:56.000\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:57.720\n in over 110 countries\n\n01:57.720 --> 02:00.320\n and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,\n\n02:00.320 --> 02:01.640\n which means the donated money\n\n02:01.640 --> 02:04.280\n is used to maximum effectiveness.\n\n02:04.280 --> 02:07.180\n When you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play,\n\n02:07.180 --> 02:11.040\n and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,\n\n02:11.040 --> 02:13.760\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,\n\n02:13.760 --> 02:15.480\n which again is an organization\n\n02:15.480 --> 02:18.360\n that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys\n\n02:18.360 --> 02:21.660\n to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n02:21.660 --> 02:25.940\n And now here's my conversation with Michael Stevens.\n\n02:25.940 --> 02:30.260\n One of your deeper interests is psychology,\n\n02:30.260 --> 02:31.760\n understanding human behavior.\n\n02:32.620 --> 02:35.480\n You've pointed out how messy studying human behavior is\n\n02:35.480 --> 02:37.420\n and that it's far from the scientific rigor\n\n02:37.420 --> 02:40.880\n of something like physics, for example.\n\n02:40.880 --> 02:43.640\n How do you think we can take psychology\n\n02:43.640 --> 02:45.680\n from where it's been in the 20th century\n\n02:45.680 --> 02:49.100\n to something more like what the physicists,\n\n02:49.100 --> 02:50.460\n theoretical physicists are doing,\n\n02:50.460 --> 02:52.380\n something precise, something rigorous?\n\n02:52.380 --> 02:57.380\n Well, we could do it by finding\n\n02:57.600 --> 03:01.200\n the physical foundations of psychology, right?\n\n03:01.200 --> 03:05.840\n If all of our emotions and moods and feelings and behaviors\n\n03:05.840 --> 03:10.840\n are the result of mechanical behaviors of atoms\n\n03:11.120 --> 03:12.800\n and molecules in our brains,\n\n03:12.800 --> 03:15.400\n then can we find correlations?\n\n03:15.400 --> 03:17.760\n Perhaps like chaos makes that really difficult\n\n03:17.760 --> 03:19.520\n and the uncertainty principle and all these things.\n\n03:19.520 --> 03:22.760\n That we can't know the position and velocity\n\n03:22.760 --> 03:27.140\n of every single quantum state in a brain, probably.\n\n03:27.140 --> 03:32.140\n But I think that if we can get to that point with psychology,\n\n03:33.560 --> 03:37.380\n then we can start to think about consciousness\n\n03:37.380 --> 03:40.960\n in a physical and mathematical way.\n\n03:40.960 --> 03:44.760\n When we ask questions like, well, what is self reference?\n\n03:44.760 --> 03:47.320\n How can you think about yourself thinking?\n\n03:47.320 --> 03:49.160\n What are some mathematical structures\n\n03:49.160 --> 03:52.400\n that could bring that about?\n\n03:52.400 --> 03:55.560\n There's ideas of, in terms of consciousness\n\n03:55.560 --> 03:59.260\n and breaking it down into physics,\n\n03:59.260 --> 04:02.400\n there's ideas of panpsychism where people believe\n\n04:02.400 --> 04:04.840\n that whatever consciousness is,\n\n04:04.840 --> 04:07.480\n is a fundamental part of reality.\n\n04:07.480 --> 04:08.860\n It's almost like a physics law.\n\n04:08.860 --> 04:11.560\n Do you think, what's your views on consciousness?\n\n04:11.560 --> 04:15.600\n Do you think it has this deep part of reality\n\n04:15.600 --> 04:17.840\n or is it something that's deeply human\n\n04:17.840 --> 04:19.500\n and constructed by us humans?\n\n04:21.640 --> 04:24.120\n Starting nice and light and easy.\n\n04:25.120 --> 04:28.280\n Nothing I ask you today has actually proven answer.\n\n04:28.280 --> 04:29.720\n So we're just hypothesizing.\n\n04:29.720 --> 04:32.960\n So yeah, I mean, I should clarify, this is all speculation\n\n04:32.960 --> 04:35.320\n and I'm not an expert in any of these topics\n\n04:35.320 --> 04:39.840\n and I'm not God, but I think that consciousness\n\n04:39.840 --> 04:44.840\n is probably something that can be fully explained\n\n04:44.840 --> 04:48.280\n within the laws of physics.\n\n04:48.280 --> 04:51.960\n I think that our bodies and brains and the universe\n\n04:51.960 --> 04:56.280\n and at the quantum level is so rich and complex.\n\n04:56.280 --> 04:58.560\n I'd be surprised if we couldn't find a room\n\n04:58.560 --> 05:00.800\n for consciousness there.\n\n05:00.800 --> 05:04.440\n And why should we be conscious?\n\n05:04.440 --> 05:06.200\n Why are we aware of ourselves?\n\n05:06.200 --> 05:10.400\n That is a very strange and interesting\n\n05:10.400 --> 05:11.960\n and important question.\n\n05:11.960 --> 05:15.640\n And I think for the next few thousand years,\n\n05:15.640 --> 05:20.200\n we're going to have to believe in answers purely on faith.\n\n05:20.200 --> 05:25.080\n But my guess is that we will find that,\n\n05:25.080 --> 05:27.080\n within the configuration space\n\n05:27.080 --> 05:29.860\n of possible arrangements of the universe,\n\n05:29.860 --> 05:34.240\n there are some that contain memories of others.\n\n05:34.240 --> 05:38.140\n Literally, Julian Barber calls them time capsule states\n\n05:38.140 --> 05:40.400\n where you're like, yeah, not only do I have a scratch\n\n05:40.400 --> 05:43.160\n on my arm, but also this state of the universe\n\n05:43.160 --> 05:45.720\n also contains a memory in my head\n\n05:45.720 --> 05:48.560\n of being scratched by my cat three days ago.\n\n05:48.560 --> 05:52.940\n And for some reason, those kinds of states of the universe\n\n05:52.940 --> 05:55.800\n are more plentiful or more likely.\n\n05:55.800 --> 05:57.120\n When you say those states,\n\n05:57.120 --> 06:00.000\n the ones that contain memories of its past\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.760\n or ones that contain memories of its past\n\n06:02.760 --> 06:05.400\n and have degrees of consciousness.\n\n06:05.400 --> 06:08.640\n Just the first part, because I think the consciousness\n\n06:08.640 --> 06:13.160\n then emerges from the fact that a state of the universe\n\n06:13.160 --> 06:18.160\n that contains fragments or memories of other states\n\n06:19.660 --> 06:22.560\n is one where you're going to feel like there's time.\n\n06:22.560 --> 06:24.160\n You're going to feel like, yeah,\n\n06:24.160 --> 06:26.400\n things happened in the past.\n\n06:26.400 --> 06:27.980\n And I don't know what'll happen in the future\n\n06:27.980 --> 06:29.600\n because these states don't contain information\n\n06:29.600 --> 06:30.760\n about the future.\n\n06:30.760 --> 06:34.000\n For some reason, those kinds of states\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:38.240\n are either more common, more plentiful,\n\n06:38.240 --> 06:40.840\n or you could use the anthropic principle and just say,\n\n06:40.840 --> 06:42.480\n well, they're extremely rare,\n\n06:42.480 --> 06:45.720\n but until you are in one, or if you are in one,\n\n06:45.720 --> 06:46.860\n then you can ask questions,\n\n06:46.860 --> 06:48.820\n like you're asking me on this podcast.\n\n06:49.920 --> 06:50.760\n Why questions?\n\n06:50.760 --> 06:52.560\n Yeah, it's like, why are we conscious?\n\n06:52.560 --> 06:53.400\n Well, because if we weren't,\n\n06:53.400 --> 06:55.240\n we wouldn't be asking why we were.\n\n06:56.040 --> 06:59.480\n You've kind of implied that you have a sense,\n\n06:59.480 --> 07:02.360\n again, hypothesis, theorizing\n\n07:02.360 --> 07:05.560\n that the universe is deterministic.\n\n07:05.560 --> 07:08.040\n What's your thoughts about free will?\n\n07:08.040 --> 07:10.320\n Do you think of the universe as deterministic\n\n07:10.320 --> 07:14.000\n in a sense that it's unrolling a particular,\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:14.960\n like there's a,\n\n07:14.960 --> 07:17.920\n it's operating under a specific set of physical laws.\n\n07:17.920 --> 07:21.360\n And when you have to set the initial conditions,\n\n07:21.360 --> 07:23.500\n it will unroll in the exact same way\n\n07:23.500 --> 07:28.440\n in our particular line of the universe every time.\n\n07:28.440 --> 07:31.600\n That is a very useful way to think about the universe.\n\n07:31.600 --> 07:32.440\n It's done us well.\n\n07:32.440 --> 07:33.740\n It's brought us to the moon.\n\n07:33.740 --> 07:35.920\n It's brought us to where we are today, right?\n\n07:35.920 --> 07:40.280\n I would not say that I believe in determinism\n\n07:40.280 --> 07:43.200\n in that kind of an absolute form,\n\n07:43.200 --> 07:45.560\n or actually I just don't care.\n\n07:45.560 --> 07:46.720\n Maybe it's true,\n\n07:46.720 --> 07:48.860\n but I'm not gonna live my life like it is.\n\n07:49.920 --> 07:50.880\n What in your sense,\n\n07:50.880 --> 07:54.120\n cause you've studied kind of how we humans\n\n07:54.120 --> 07:55.820\n think of the world.\n\n07:55.820 --> 07:59.240\n What's in your view is the difference between our perception,\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:02.320\n like how we think the world is and reality.\n\n08:02.320 --> 08:04.120\n Do you think there's a huge gap there?\n\n08:04.120 --> 08:07.240\n Like we delude ourselves that the whole thing is an illusion.\n\n08:07.240 --> 08:09.360\n Just everything about human psychology,\n\n08:09.360 --> 08:12.880\n the way we see things and how things actually are.\n\n08:12.880 --> 08:14.760\n All the things you've studied, what's your sense?\n\n08:14.760 --> 08:16.920\n How big is the gap between reality and perception?\n\n08:16.920 --> 08:18.920\n Well, again, purely speculative.\n\n08:18.920 --> 08:20.960\n I think that we will never know the answer.\n\n08:20.960 --> 08:22.600\n We cannot know the answer.\n\n08:22.600 --> 08:26.960\n There is no experiment to find an answer to that question.\n\n08:26.960 --> 08:30.240\n Everything we experience is an event in our brain.\n\n08:30.240 --> 08:32.880\n When I look at a cat, I'm not even,\n\n08:32.880 --> 08:36.660\n I can't prove that there's a cat there.\n\n08:36.660 --> 08:40.900\n All I am experiencing is the perception of a cat\n\n08:40.900 --> 08:43.100\n inside my own brain.\n\n08:43.100 --> 08:46.300\n I am only a witness to the events of my mind.\n\n08:46.300 --> 08:50.060\n I think it is very useful to infer that\n\n08:50.060 --> 08:54.060\n if I witness the event of cat in my head,\n\n08:54.060 --> 08:57.180\n it's because I'm looking at a cat that is literally there\n\n08:57.180 --> 08:59.900\n and it has its own feelings and motivations\n\n08:59.900 --> 09:03.100\n and should be pet and given food and water and love.\n\n09:03.100 --> 09:05.940\n I think that's the way you should live your life.\n\n09:05.940 --> 09:09.500\n But whether or not we live in a simulation,\n\n09:09.500 --> 09:13.040\n I'm a brain in a vat, I don't know.\n\n09:13.040 --> 09:13.880\n Do you care?\n\n09:14.900 --> 09:16.800\n I don't really.\n\n09:16.800 --> 09:19.580\n Well, I care because it's a fascinating question.\n\n09:19.580 --> 09:22.600\n And it's a fantastic way to get people excited about\n\n09:23.740 --> 09:26.260\n all kinds of topics, physics, psychology,\n\n09:26.260 --> 09:28.100\n consciousness, philosophy.\n\n09:28.100 --> 09:31.000\n But at the end of the day, what would the difference be?\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:31.840\n If you...\n\n09:31.840 --> 09:33.780\n The cat needs to be fed at the end of the day,\n\n09:33.780 --> 09:35.620\n otherwise it'll be a dead cat.\n\n09:35.620 --> 09:38.420\n Right, but if it's not even a real cat,\n\n09:38.420 --> 09:40.320\n then it's just like a video game cat.\n\n09:40.320 --> 09:43.040\n And right, so what's the difference between killing\n\n09:43.040 --> 09:46.740\n a digital cat in a video game because of neglect\n\n09:46.740 --> 09:48.320\n versus a real cat?\n\n09:48.320 --> 09:50.540\n It seems very different to us psychologically.\n\n09:50.540 --> 09:52.400\n Like I don't really feel bad about, oh my gosh,\n\n09:52.400 --> 09:54.380\n I forgot to feed my Tamagotchi, right?\n\n09:54.380 --> 09:55.780\n But I would feel terrible\n\n09:55.780 --> 09:58.940\n if I forgot to feed my actual cats.\n\n09:58.940 --> 10:03.420\n So can you just touch on the topic of simulation?\n\n10:03.420 --> 10:06.220\n Do you find this thought experiment that we're living\n\n10:06.220 --> 10:10.500\n in a simulation useful, inspiring or constructive\n\n10:10.500 --> 10:11.580\n in any kind of way?\n\n10:11.580 --> 10:12.980\n Do you think it's ridiculous?\n\n10:12.980 --> 10:14.980\n Do you think it could be true?\n\n10:14.980 --> 10:17.540\n Or is it just a useful thought experiment?\n\n10:17.540 --> 10:20.920\n I think it is extremely useful as a thought experiment\n\n10:20.920 --> 10:24.700\n because it makes sense to everyone,\n\n10:24.700 --> 10:27.360\n especially as we see virtual reality\n\n10:27.360 --> 10:30.580\n and computer games getting more and more complex.\n\n10:30.580 --> 10:33.900\n You're not talking to an audience in like Newton's time\n\n10:33.900 --> 10:36.660\n where you're like, imagine a clock\n\n10:36.660 --> 10:38.820\n that it has mechanics in it that are so complex\n\n10:38.820 --> 10:40.220\n that it can create love.\n\n10:40.220 --> 10:42.380\n And everyone's like, no.\n\n10:42.380 --> 10:46.540\n But today you really start to feel, man,\n\n10:46.540 --> 10:48.960\n at what point is this little robot friend of mine\n\n10:48.960 --> 10:53.960\n gonna be like someone I don't want to cancel plans with?\n\n10:53.960 --> 10:58.960\n And so it's a great, the thought experiment\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:00.280\n of do we live in a simulation?\n\n11:00.280 --> 11:03.760\n Am I a brain in a vat that is just being given\n\n11:03.760 --> 11:08.760\n electrical impulses from some nefarious other beings\n\n11:08.960 --> 11:11.000\n so that I believe that I live on earth\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.040\n and that I have a body and all of this?\n\n11:13.040 --> 11:15.480\n And the fact that you can't prove it either way\n\n11:15.480 --> 11:17.480\n is a fantastic way to introduce people\n\n11:17.480 --> 11:19.800\n to some of the deepest questions.\n\n11:20.760 --> 11:23.080\n So you mentioned a little buddy\n\n11:23.080 --> 11:25.700\n that you would want to cancel an appointment with.\n\n11:25.700 --> 11:27.800\n So that's a lot of our conversations.\n\n11:27.800 --> 11:30.740\n That's what my research is, is artificial intelligence.\n\n11:32.240 --> 11:34.520\n And I apologize, but you're such a fun person\n\n11:34.520 --> 11:36.880\n to ask these big questions with.\n\n11:36.880 --> 11:40.200\n Well, I hope I can give some answers that are interesting.\n\n11:40.200 --> 11:45.200\n Well, because of you've sharpened your brain's ability\n\n11:45.200 --> 11:47.940\n to explore some of the most, some of the questions\n\n11:47.940 --> 11:51.120\n that many scientists are actually afraid of even touching,\n\n11:51.120 --> 11:52.380\n which is fascinating.\n\n11:52.380 --> 11:56.580\n I think you're in that sense ultimately a great scientist\n\n11:56.580 --> 11:58.920\n through this process of sharpening your brain.\n\n11:58.920 --> 12:01.740\n Well, I don't know if I am a scientist.\n\n12:01.740 --> 12:04.920\n I think science is a way of knowing\n\n12:04.920 --> 12:09.440\n and there are a lot of questions I investigate\n\n12:09.440 --> 12:11.960\n that are not scientific questions.\n\n12:11.960 --> 12:14.200\n On like mind field, we have definitely done\n\n12:14.200 --> 12:17.680\n scientific experiments and studies that had hypotheses\n\n12:17.680 --> 12:22.240\n and all of that, but not to be too like precious\n\n12:22.240 --> 12:24.200\n about what does the word science mean?\n\n12:24.200 --> 12:27.600\n But I think I would just describe myself as curious\n\n12:27.600 --> 12:29.920\n and I hope that that curiosity is contagious.\n\n12:29.920 --> 12:31.840\n So to you, the scientific method\n\n12:31.840 --> 12:33.720\n is deeply connected to science\n\n12:33.720 --> 12:38.280\n because your curiosity took you to asking questions.\n\n12:38.280 --> 12:43.280\n To me, asking a good question, even if you feel,\n\n12:43.440 --> 12:45.400\n society feels that it's not a question\n\n12:45.400 --> 12:47.320\n within the reach of science currently.\n\n12:47.320 --> 12:51.320\n To me, asking the question is the biggest step\n\n12:51.320 --> 12:53.320\n of the scientific process.\n\n12:53.320 --> 12:57.240\n The scientific method is the second part\n\n12:57.240 --> 12:59.400\n and that may be what traditionally is called science,\n\n12:59.400 --> 13:00.840\n but to me, asking the questions,\n\n13:00.840 --> 13:03.000\n being brave enough to ask the questions,\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\n being curious and not constrained\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:09.880\n by what you're supposed to think is just true,\n\n13:09.880 --> 13:11.560\n what it means to be a scientist to me.\n\n13:11.560 --> 13:15.260\n It's certainly a huge part of what it means to be a human.\n\n13:16.380 --> 13:17.520\n If I were to say, you know what?\n\n13:17.520 --> 13:19.080\n I don't believe in forces.\n\n13:19.080 --> 13:22.120\n I think that when I push on a massive object,\n\n13:22.120 --> 13:25.680\n a ghost leaves my body and enters the object I'm pushing\n\n13:25.680 --> 13:28.040\n and these ghosts happen to just get really lazy\n\n13:28.040 --> 13:29.760\n when they're around massive things\n\n13:29.760 --> 13:31.200\n and that's why F equals MA.\n\n13:32.640 --> 13:34.360\n Oh, and by the way, the laziness of the ghost\n\n13:34.360 --> 13:36.320\n is in proportion to the mass of the object.\n\n13:36.320 --> 13:37.760\n So boom, prove me wrong.\n\n13:37.760 --> 13:41.060\n Every experiment, well, you can never find the ghost.\n\n13:41.060 --> 13:45.880\n And so none of that theory is scientific,\n\n13:45.880 --> 13:49.380\n but once I start saying, can I see the ghost?\n\n13:49.380 --> 13:50.880\n Why should there be a ghost?\n\n13:50.880 --> 13:53.100\n And if there aren't ghosts, what might I expect?\n\n13:53.100 --> 13:56.540\n And I start to do different tests to see,\n\n13:56.540 --> 13:58.000\n is this falsifiable?\n\n13:59.120 --> 14:01.520\n Are there things that should happen if there are ghosts\n\n14:01.520 --> 14:02.740\n or are there things that shouldn't happen?\n\n14:02.740 --> 14:05.120\n And do they, you know, what do I observe?\n\n14:05.120 --> 14:06.920\n Now I'm thinking scientifically.\n\n14:06.920 --> 14:10.960\n I don't think of science as, wow, a picture of a black hole.\n\n14:10.960 --> 14:12.240\n That's just a photograph.\n\n14:12.240 --> 14:13.060\n That's an image.\n\n14:13.060 --> 14:13.900\n That's data.\n\n14:13.900 --> 14:16.480\n That's a sensory and perception experience.\n\n14:16.480 --> 14:19.640\n Science is how we got that and how we understand it\n\n14:19.640 --> 14:20.680\n and how we believe in it\n\n14:20.680 --> 14:24.040\n and how we reduce our uncertainty around what it means.\n\n14:24.040 --> 14:28.260\n But I would say I'm deeply within the scientific community\n\n14:28.260 --> 14:31.600\n and I'm sometimes disheartened by the elitism\n\n14:31.600 --> 14:34.640\n of the thinking, sort of not allowing yourself\n\n14:34.640 --> 14:36.280\n to think outside the box.\n\n14:36.280 --> 14:37.880\n So allowing the possibility\n\n14:37.880 --> 14:40.040\n of going against the conventions of science,\n\n14:40.040 --> 14:43.920\n I think is a beautiful part of some\n\n14:43.920 --> 14:46.280\n of the greatest scientists in history.\n\n14:46.280 --> 14:49.840\n I don't know, I'm impressed by scientists every day\n\n14:49.840 --> 14:54.840\n and revolutions in our knowledge of the world occur\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:00.760\n only under very special circumstances.\n\n15:00.760 --> 15:05.680\n It is very scary to challenge conventional thinking\n\n15:05.680 --> 15:10.440\n and risky because let's go back to elitism and ego, right?\n\n15:10.440 --> 15:11.440\n If you just say, you know what?\n\n15:11.440 --> 15:14.000\n I believe in the spirits of my body\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.900\n and all forces are actually created by invisible creatures\n\n15:17.900 --> 15:21.160\n that transfer themselves between objects.\n\n15:22.360 --> 15:26.680\n If you ridicule every other theory\n\n15:26.680 --> 15:28.800\n and say that you're correct,\n\n15:28.800 --> 15:31.680\n then ego gets involved and you just don't go anywhere.\n\n15:31.680 --> 15:35.640\n But fundamentally the question of well, what is a force\n\n15:36.800 --> 15:38.560\n is incredibly important.\n\n15:38.560 --> 15:40.040\n We need to have that conversation,\n\n15:40.040 --> 15:42.640\n but it needs to be done in this very political way\n\n15:42.640 --> 15:44.640\n of like, let's be respectful of everyone\n\n15:44.640 --> 15:46.920\n and let's realize that we're all learning together\n\n15:46.920 --> 15:49.000\n and not shutting out other people.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:54.000\n And so when you look at a lot of revolutionary ideas,\n\n15:54.720 --> 15:57.460\n they were not accepted right away.\n\n15:57.460 --> 16:00.560\n And, you know, Galileo had a couple of problems\n\n16:00.560 --> 16:04.800\n with the authorities and later thinkers, Descartes,\n\n16:04.800 --> 16:06.980\n was like, all right, look, I kind of agree with Galileo,\n\n16:06.980 --> 16:11.380\n but I'm gonna have to not say that.\n\n16:11.380 --> 16:13.740\n I'll have to create and invent and write different things\n\n16:13.740 --> 16:15.100\n that keep me from being in trouble,\n\n16:15.100 --> 16:17.320\n but we still slowly made progress.\n\n16:17.320 --> 16:19.240\n Revolutions are difficult in all forms\n\n16:19.240 --> 16:20.480\n and certainly in science.\n\n16:20.480 --> 16:23.840\n Before we get to AI, on topic of revolutionary ideas,\n\n16:23.840 --> 16:28.840\n let me ask on a Reddit AMA, you said that is the earth flat\n\n16:28.840 --> 16:31.600\n is one of the favorite questions you've ever answered,\n\n16:31.600 --> 16:33.640\n speaking of revolutionary ideas.\n\n16:33.640 --> 16:37.080\n So your video on that, people should definitely watch,\n\n16:37.080 --> 16:38.820\n is really fascinating.\n\n16:39.760 --> 16:41.660\n Can you elaborate why you enjoyed\n\n16:41.660 --> 16:43.800\n answering this question so much?\n\n16:43.800 --> 16:45.620\n Yeah, well, it's a long story.\n\n16:45.620 --> 16:49.380\n I remember a long time ago,\n\n16:49.380 --> 16:50.940\n I was living in New York at the time,\n\n16:50.940 --> 16:54.000\n so it had to have been like 2009 or something.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:57.600\n I visited the Flat Earth forums\n\n16:57.600 --> 17:00.280\n and this was before the Flat Earth theories\n\n17:00.280 --> 17:03.160\n became as sort of mainstream as they are.\n\n17:03.160 --> 17:06.720\n Sorry to ask the dumb question, forums, online forums.\n\n17:06.720 --> 17:09.040\n Yeah, the Flat Earth Society,\n\n17:09.040 --> 17:11.200\n I don't know if it's.com or.org, but I went there\n\n17:11.200 --> 17:14.200\n and I was reading their ideas\n\n17:14.200 --> 17:17.880\n and how they responded to typical criticisms of,\n\n17:17.880 --> 17:20.280\n well, the earth isn't flat because what about this?\n\n17:20.280 --> 17:23.760\n And I could not tell, and I mentioned this in my video,\n\n17:23.760 --> 17:28.640\n I couldn't tell how many of these community members\n\n17:28.640 --> 17:32.400\n actually believe the earth was flat or we're just trolling.\n\n17:32.400 --> 17:36.320\n And I realized that the fascinating thing is,\n\n17:36.320 --> 17:38.480\n how do we know anything?\n\n17:38.480 --> 17:41.640\n And what makes for a good belief\n\n17:41.640 --> 17:45.240\n versus a maybe not so tenable or good belief?\n\n17:45.240 --> 17:47.560\n And so that's really what my video\n\n17:47.560 --> 17:49.920\n about earth being flat is about.\n\n17:49.920 --> 17:52.320\n It's about, look, there are a lot of reasons\n\n17:52.320 --> 17:55.680\n that the earth is probably not flat,\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:00.600\n but a Flat Earth believer can respond\n\n18:00.600 --> 18:04.120\n to every single one of them, but it's all in an ad hoc way.\n\n18:04.120 --> 18:05.760\n And all of these, all of their rebuttals\n\n18:05.760 --> 18:07.040\n aren't necessarily gonna form\n\n18:07.040 --> 18:10.760\n a cohesive noncontradictory whole.\n\n18:10.760 --> 18:12.520\n And I believe that's the episode\n\n18:12.520 --> 18:14.960\n where I talk about Occam's razor\n\n18:14.960 --> 18:17.400\n and Newton's flaming laser sword.\n\n18:17.400 --> 18:19.480\n And then I say, well, you know what, wait a second.\n\n18:19.480 --> 18:24.480\n We know that space contracts as you move.\n\n18:25.040 --> 18:27.200\n And so to a particle moving near the speed of light\n\n18:27.200 --> 18:29.560\n towards earth, earth would be flattened\n\n18:29.560 --> 18:32.200\n in the direction of that particles travel.\n\n18:32.200 --> 18:35.520\n So to them, earth is flat.\n\n18:35.520 --> 18:40.520\n Like we need to be really generous to even wild ideas\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.800\n because they're all thinking,\n\n18:43.800 --> 18:45.840\n they're all the communication of ideas.\n\n18:45.840 --> 18:48.240\n And what else can it mean to be a human?\n\n18:48.240 --> 18:50.960\n Yeah, and I think I'm a huge fan\n\n18:50.960 --> 18:54.880\n of the Flat Earth theory, quote unquote,\n\n18:54.880 --> 18:57.520\n in the sense that to me it feels harmless\n\n18:57.520 --> 18:59.000\n to explore some of the questions\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.480\n of what it means to believe something,\n\n19:00.480 --> 19:05.000\n what it means to explore the edge of science and so on.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.160\n Cause it's a harm, it's a, to me,\n\n19:07.160 --> 19:09.680\n nobody gets hurt whether the earth is flat or round,\n\n19:09.680 --> 19:11.840\n not literally, but I mean intellectually\n\n19:11.840 --> 19:13.360\n when we're just having a conversation.\n\n19:13.360 --> 19:15.760\n That said, again, to elitism,\n\n19:15.760 --> 19:18.640\n I find that scientists roll their eyes\n\n19:18.640 --> 19:21.400\n way too fast on the Flat Earth.\n\n19:21.400 --> 19:25.520\n The kind of dismissal that I see to this even notion,\n\n19:25.520 --> 19:27.760\n they haven't like sat down and say,\n\n19:27.760 --> 19:30.120\n what are the arguments that are being proposed?\n\n19:30.120 --> 19:32.600\n And this is why these arguments are incorrect.\n\n19:32.600 --> 19:35.040\n So that should be something\n\n19:35.040 --> 19:37.480\n that scientists should always do,\n\n19:37.480 --> 19:42.160\n even to the most sort of ideas that seem ridiculous.\n\n19:42.160 --> 19:45.880\n So I like this as almost, it's almost my test\n\n19:45.880 --> 19:48.440\n when I ask people what they think about Flat Earth theory,\n\n19:48.440 --> 19:51.080\n to see how quickly they roll their eyes.\n\n19:51.080 --> 19:53.880\n Well, yeah, I mean, let me go on record\n\n19:53.880 --> 19:58.400\n and say that the earth is not flat.\n\n19:58.400 --> 20:02.040\n It is a three dimensional spheroid.\n\n20:02.040 --> 20:07.000\n However, I don't know that and it has not been proven.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.800\n Science doesn't prove anything.\n\n20:08.800 --> 20:10.680\n It just reduces uncertainty.\n\n20:10.680 --> 20:12.320\n Could the earth actually be flat?\n\n20:13.960 --> 20:18.960\n Extremely unlikely, extremely unlikely.\n\n20:19.040 --> 20:21.640\n And so it is a ridiculous notion\n\n20:21.640 --> 20:26.640\n if we care about how probable and certain our ideas might be.\n\n20:26.680 --> 20:28.400\n But I think it's incredibly important\n\n20:28.400 --> 20:32.120\n to talk about science in that way\n\n20:32.120 --> 20:35.280\n and to not resort to, well, it's true.\n\n20:35.280 --> 20:39.880\n It's true in the same way that a mathematical theorem\n\n20:39.880 --> 20:41.280\n is true.\n\n20:41.280 --> 20:46.280\n And I think we're kind of like being pretty pedantic\n\n20:46.520 --> 20:48.400\n about defining this stuff.\n\n20:48.400 --> 20:51.680\n But like, sure, I could take a rocket ship out\n\n20:51.680 --> 20:53.680\n and I could orbit earth and look at it\n\n20:53.680 --> 20:55.840\n and it would look like a ball, right?\n\n20:56.880 --> 20:59.360\n But I still can't prove that I'm not living in a simulation,\n\n20:59.360 --> 21:00.520\n that I'm not a brain in a vat,\n\n21:00.520 --> 21:02.640\n that this isn't all an elaborate ruse\n\n21:02.640 --> 21:04.600\n created by some technologically advanced\n\n21:04.600 --> 21:06.520\n extraterrestrial civilization.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:11.000\n So there's always some doubt and that's fine.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.280\n That's exciting.\n\n21:12.280 --> 21:14.840\n And I think that kind of doubt, practically speaking,\n\n21:14.840 --> 21:17.720\n is useful when you start talking about quantum mechanics\n\n21:17.720 --> 21:20.360\n or string theory, sort of, it helps.\n\n21:20.360 --> 21:23.200\n To me, that kind of adds a little spice\n\n21:23.200 --> 21:26.440\n into the thinking process of scientists.\n\n21:26.440 --> 21:30.040\n So, I mean, just as a thought experiment,\n\n21:30.040 --> 21:33.400\n your video kind of, okay, say the earth is flat.\n\n21:33.400 --> 21:36.640\n What would the forces when you walk about this flat earth\n\n21:36.640 --> 21:38.360\n feel like to the human?\n\n21:38.360 --> 21:40.600\n That's a really nice thought experiment to think about.\n\n21:40.600 --> 21:42.440\n Right, because what's really nice about it\n\n21:42.440 --> 21:45.400\n is that it's a funny thought experiment,\n\n21:45.400 --> 21:48.040\n but you actually wind up accidentally learning\n\n21:48.040 --> 21:51.640\n a whole lot about gravity and about relativity\n\n21:51.640 --> 21:53.240\n and geometry.\n\n21:53.240 --> 21:56.280\n And I think that's really the goal of what I'm doing.\n\n21:56.280 --> 21:57.640\n I'm not trying to like convince people\n\n21:57.640 --> 21:58.840\n that the earth is round.\n\n21:58.840 --> 22:01.280\n I feel like you either believe that it is or you don't\n\n22:01.280 --> 22:04.680\n and like, that's, you know, how can I change that?\n\n22:04.680 --> 22:06.920\n What I can do is change how you think\n\n22:06.920 --> 22:10.920\n and how you are introduced to important concepts.\n\n22:10.920 --> 22:13.760\n Like, well, how does gravity operate?\n\n22:13.760 --> 22:16.480\n Oh, it's all about the center of mass of an object.\n\n22:16.480 --> 22:19.480\n So right, on a sphere, we're all pulled towards the middle,\n\n22:19.480 --> 22:21.440\n essentially the centroid geometrically,\n\n22:21.440 --> 22:24.560\n but on a disc, ooh, you're gonna be pulled at a weird angle\n\n22:24.560 --> 22:25.920\n if you're out near the edge.\n\n22:25.920 --> 22:28.400\n And that stuff's fascinating.\n\n22:28.400 --> 22:32.880\n Yeah, and to me, that was, that particular video\n\n22:34.520 --> 22:37.520\n opened my eyes even more to what gravity is.\n\n22:37.520 --> 22:40.040\n It's just a really nice visualization tool of,\n\n22:40.040 --> 22:43.080\n because you always imagine gravity with spheres,\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:44.600\n with masses that are spheres.\n\n22:44.600 --> 22:45.440\n Yeah.\n\n22:45.440 --> 22:48.280\n And imagining gravity on masses that are not spherical,\n\n22:48.280 --> 22:53.280\n some other shape, but in here, a plate, a flat object,\n\n22:53.400 --> 22:54.240\n is really interesting.\n\n22:54.240 --> 22:56.280\n It makes you really kind of visualize\n\n22:56.280 --> 22:57.800\n in a three dimensional way the force of gravity.\n\n22:57.800 --> 23:02.800\n Yeah, even if a disc the size of Earth would be impossible,\n\n23:05.880 --> 23:09.040\n I think anything larger than like the moon basically\n\n23:09.040 --> 23:13.760\n needs to be a sphere because gravity will round it out.\n\n23:15.240 --> 23:18.120\n So you can't have a teacup the size of Jupiter, right?\n\n23:18.120 --> 23:21.040\n There's a great book about the teacup in the universe\n\n23:21.040 --> 23:22.920\n that I highly recommend.\n\n23:22.920 --> 23:24.720\n I don't remember the author.\n\n23:24.720 --> 23:26.800\n I forget her name, but it's a wonderful book.\n\n23:26.800 --> 23:28.200\n So look it up.\n\n23:28.200 --> 23:30.200\n I think it's called Teacup in the Universe.\n\n23:30.200 --> 23:32.680\n Just to link on this point briefly,\n\n23:32.680 --> 23:37.120\n your videos are generally super, people love them, right?\n\n23:37.120 --> 23:39.600\n If you look at the sort of number of likes versus dislikes\n\n23:39.600 --> 23:43.140\n is this measure of YouTube, right, is incredible.\n\n23:43.140 --> 23:45.240\n And as do I.\n\n23:45.240 --> 23:48.160\n But this particular flat Earth video\n\n23:48.160 --> 23:51.800\n has more dislikes than usual.\n\n23:51.800 --> 23:55.320\n What do you, on that topic in general,\n\n23:55.320 --> 23:58.800\n what's your sense, how big is the community,\n\n23:58.800 --> 24:00.740\n not just who believes in flat Earth,\n\n24:00.740 --> 24:03.720\n but sort of the anti scientific community\n\n24:03.720 --> 24:08.200\n that naturally distrust scientists in a way\n\n24:08.200 --> 24:12.200\n that's not an open minded way,\n\n24:12.200 --> 24:13.720\n like really just distrust scientists\n\n24:13.720 --> 24:17.040\n like they're bought by some kind of mechanism\n\n24:17.040 --> 24:18.880\n of some kind of bigger system\n\n24:18.880 --> 24:21.080\n that's trying to manipulate human beings.\n\n24:21.080 --> 24:24.040\n What's your sense of the size of that community?\n\n24:24.040 --> 24:28.960\n You're one of the sort of great educators in the world\n\n24:28.960 --> 24:33.960\n that educates people on the exciting power of science.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:38.080\n So you're kind of up against this community.\n\n24:38.080 --> 24:39.960\n What's your sense of it?\n\n24:39.960 --> 24:41.960\n I really have no idea.\n\n24:41.960 --> 24:44.200\n I haven't looked at the likes and dislikes\n\n24:44.200 --> 24:45.320\n on the flat Earth video.\n\n24:45.320 --> 24:49.100\n And so I would wonder if it has a greater percentage\n\n24:49.100 --> 24:51.340\n of dislikes than usual,\n\n24:51.340 --> 24:53.520\n is that because of people disliking it\n\n24:53.520 --> 24:56.720\n because they think that it's a video\n\n24:56.720 --> 25:01.260\n about Earth being flat and they find that ridiculous\n\n25:01.260 --> 25:04.200\n and they dislike it without even really watching much?\n\n25:04.200 --> 25:07.360\n Do they wish that I was more like dismissive\n\n25:07.360 --> 25:08.560\n of flat Earth theories?\n\n25:08.560 --> 25:09.760\n Yeah.\n\n25:09.760 --> 25:10.600\n That's possible too.\n\n25:10.600 --> 25:12.080\n I know there are a lot of response videos\n\n25:12.080 --> 25:17.080\n that kind of go through the episode and are pro flat Earth,\n\n25:18.600 --> 25:21.860\n but I don't know if there's a larger community\n\n25:21.860 --> 25:25.120\n of unorthodox thinkers today\n\n25:25.120 --> 25:27.440\n than there have been in the past.\n\n25:27.440 --> 25:29.960\n And I just wanna not lose them.\n\n25:29.960 --> 25:32.580\n I want them to keep listening and thinking\n\n25:32.580 --> 25:36.640\n and by calling them all idiots or something,\n\n25:36.640 --> 25:41.020\n that does no good because how idiotic are they really?\n\n25:41.020 --> 25:45.300\n I mean, the Earth isn't a sphere at all.\n\n25:45.300 --> 25:47.720\n We know that it's an oblate spheroid\n\n25:47.720 --> 25:50.340\n and that in and of itself is really interesting.\n\n25:50.340 --> 25:52.240\n And I investigated that in which way is down\n\n25:52.240 --> 25:54.200\n where I'm like, really down does not point\n\n25:54.200 --> 25:56.240\n towards the center of the Earth.\n\n25:56.240 --> 25:58.920\n It points in different direction,\n\n25:58.920 --> 26:01.640\n depending on what's underneath you and what's above you\n\n26:01.640 --> 26:02.480\n and what's around you.\n\n26:02.480 --> 26:06.000\n The whole universe is tugging on me.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:10.080\n And then you also show that gravity is non uniform\n\n26:10.080 --> 26:11.680\n across the globe.\n\n26:11.680 --> 26:14.400\n Like if you, there's this I guess thought experiment\n\n26:14.400 --> 26:19.400\n if you build a bridge all the way across the Earth\n\n26:19.400 --> 26:23.440\n and then just knock out its pillars, what would happen?\n\n26:23.440 --> 26:27.080\n And you describe how it would be like a very chaotic,\n\n26:27.080 --> 26:28.960\n unstable thing that's happening\n\n26:28.960 --> 26:31.760\n because gravity is non uniform throughout the Earth.\n\n26:31.760 --> 26:36.620\n Yeah, in small spaces, like the ones we work in,\n\n26:36.620 --> 26:39.320\n we can essentially assume that gravity is uniform,\n\n26:39.320 --> 26:40.880\n but it's not.\n\n26:40.880 --> 26:43.040\n It is weaker the further you are from the Earth.\n\n26:43.040 --> 26:47.080\n And it also is going to be,\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:50.060\n it's radially pointed towards the middle of the Earth.\n\n26:50.060 --> 26:54.160\n So a really large object will feel tidal forces\n\n26:54.160 --> 26:55.640\n because of that non uniformness.\n\n26:55.640 --> 26:58.500\n And we can take advantage of that with satellites, right?\n\n26:58.500 --> 27:00.280\n Gravitational induced torque.\n\n27:00.280 --> 27:01.680\n It's a great way to align your satellite\n\n27:01.680 --> 27:05.560\n without having to use fuel or any kind of engine.\n\n27:05.560 --> 27:08.320\n So let's jump back to it, artificial intelligence.\n\n27:08.320 --> 27:11.180\n What's your thought of the state of where we are at\n\n27:11.180 --> 27:12.920\n currently with artificial intelligence\n\n27:12.920 --> 27:15.880\n and what do you think it takes to build human level\n\n27:15.880 --> 27:17.960\n or superhuman level intelligence?\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:20.400\n I don't know what intelligence means.\n\n27:20.400 --> 27:22.840\n That's my biggest question at the moment.\n\n27:22.840 --> 27:25.080\n And I think it's because my instinct is always to go,\n\n27:25.080 --> 27:28.000\n well, what are the foundations here of our discussion?\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.080\n What does it mean to be intelligent?\n\n27:31.080 --> 27:35.320\n How do we measure the intelligence of an artificial machine\n\n27:35.320 --> 27:37.480\n or a program or something?\n\n27:37.480 --> 27:39.880\n Can we say that humans are intelligent?\n\n27:39.880 --> 27:42.600\n Because there's also a fascinating field\n\n27:42.600 --> 27:44.280\n of how do you measure human intelligence.\n\n27:44.280 --> 27:45.360\n Of course.\n\n27:45.360 --> 27:47.080\n But if we just take that for granted,\n\n27:47.080 --> 27:50.000\n saying that whatever this fuzzy intelligence thing\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.200\n we're talking about, humans kind of have it.\n\n27:53.080 --> 27:56.680\n What would be a good test for you?\n\n27:56.680 --> 27:59.160\n So during develop a test that's natural language\n\n27:59.160 --> 28:01.600\n conversation, would that impress you?\n\n28:01.600 --> 28:03.360\n A chat bot that you'd want to hang out\n\n28:03.360 --> 28:06.600\n and have a beer with for a bunch of hours\n\n28:06.600 --> 28:08.360\n or have dinner plans with.\n\n28:08.360 --> 28:10.240\n Is that a good test, natural language conversation?\n\n28:10.240 --> 28:12.260\n Is there something else that would impress you?\n\n28:12.260 --> 28:13.640\n Or is that also too difficult to think about?\n\n28:13.640 --> 28:16.120\n Oh yeah, I'm pretty much impressed by everything.\n\n28:16.120 --> 28:20.320\n I think that if there was a chat bot\n\n28:20.320 --> 28:23.360\n that was like incredibly, I don't know,\n\n28:23.360 --> 28:24.460\n really had a personality.\n\n28:24.460 --> 28:27.940\n And if I didn't be the Turing test, right?\n\n28:27.940 --> 28:32.940\n Like if I'm unable to tell that it's not another person\n\n28:33.360 --> 28:36.560\n but then I was shown a bunch of wires\n\n28:36.560 --> 28:39.060\n and mechanical components.\n\n28:39.060 --> 28:42.680\n And it was like, that's actually what you're talking to.\n\n28:42.680 --> 28:46.440\n I don't know if I would feel that guilty destroying it.\n\n28:46.440 --> 28:49.240\n I would feel guilty because clearly it's well made\n\n28:49.240 --> 28:51.040\n and it's a really cool thing.\n\n28:51.040 --> 28:53.800\n It's like destroying a really cool car or something\n\n28:53.800 --> 28:56.280\n but I would not feel like I was a murderer.\n\n28:56.280 --> 28:58.800\n So yeah, at what point would I start to feel that way?\n\n28:58.800 --> 29:02.680\n And this is such a subjective psychological question.\n\n29:02.680 --> 29:07.680\n If you give it movement or if you have it act as though\n\n29:07.680 --> 29:11.840\n or perhaps really feel pain as I destroy it\n\n29:11.840 --> 29:15.640\n and scream and resist, then I'd feel bad.\n\n29:15.640 --> 29:16.680\n Yeah, it's beautifully put.\n\n29:16.680 --> 29:20.480\n And let's just say act like it's a pain.\n\n29:20.480 --> 29:25.480\n So if you just have a robot that not screams,\n\n29:25.640 --> 29:28.440\n just like moans in pain if you kick it,\n\n29:28.440 --> 29:30.920\n that immediately just puts it in a class\n\n29:30.920 --> 29:35.280\n that we humans, it becomes, we anthropomorphize it.\n\n29:35.280 --> 29:37.920\n It almost immediately becomes human.\n\n29:37.920 --> 29:39.320\n So that's a psychology question\n\n29:39.320 --> 29:40.920\n as opposed to sort of a physics question.\n\n29:40.920 --> 29:43.080\n Right, I think that's a really good instinct to have.\n\n29:43.080 --> 29:44.080\n If the robot.\n\n29:45.720 --> 29:46.560\n Screams.\n\n29:46.560 --> 29:50.160\n Screams and moans, even if you don't believe\n\n29:50.160 --> 29:52.640\n that it has the mental experience,\n\n29:52.640 --> 29:55.280\n the qualia of pain and suffering,\n\n29:55.280 --> 29:56.760\n I think it's still a good instinct to say,\n\n29:56.760 --> 29:59.960\n you know what, I'd rather not hurt it.\n\n29:59.960 --> 30:02.560\n The problem is that instinct can get us in trouble\n\n30:02.560 --> 30:05.560\n because then robots can manipulate that.\n\n30:05.560 --> 30:08.240\n And there's different kinds of robots.\n\n30:08.240 --> 30:10.640\n There's robots like the Facebook and the YouTube algorithm\n\n30:10.640 --> 30:11.920\n that recommends the video,\n\n30:11.920 --> 30:14.440\n and they can manipulate in the same kind of way.\n\n30:14.440 --> 30:16.240\n Well, let me ask you just to stick\n\n30:16.240 --> 30:17.840\n on artificial intelligence for a second.\n\n30:17.840 --> 30:21.720\n Do you have worries about existential threats from AI\n\n30:21.720 --> 30:23.680\n or existential threats from other technologies\n\n30:23.680 --> 30:27.720\n like nuclear weapons that could potentially destroy life\n\n30:27.720 --> 30:31.200\n on earth or damage it to a very significant degree?\n\n30:31.200 --> 30:32.280\n Yeah, of course I do.\n\n30:32.280 --> 30:35.280\n Especially the weapons that we create.\n\n30:35.280 --> 30:38.080\n There's all kinds of famous ways to think about this.\n\n30:38.080 --> 30:41.440\n And one is that, wow, what if we don't see\n\n30:41.440 --> 30:46.440\n advanced alien civilizations because of the danger\n\n30:46.800 --> 30:50.600\n of technology?\n\n30:50.600 --> 30:51.800\n What if we reach a point,\n\n30:51.800 --> 30:55.000\n and I think there's a channel, Thoughty2,\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.400\n geez, I wish I remembered the name of the channel,\n\n30:57.400 --> 30:59.960\n but he delves into this kind of limit\n\n30:59.960 --> 31:04.960\n of maybe once you discover radioactivity and its power,\n\n31:04.960 --> 31:07.160\n you've reached this important hurdle.\n\n31:07.160 --> 31:09.400\n And the reason that the skies are so empty\n\n31:09.400 --> 31:13.880\n is that no one's ever managed to survive as a civilization\n\n31:13.880 --> 31:16.840\n once they have that destructive power.\n\n31:16.840 --> 31:21.840\n And when it comes to AI, I'm not really very worried\n\n31:22.320 --> 31:24.760\n because I think that there are plenty of other people\n\n31:24.760 --> 31:26.440\n that are already worried enough.\n\n31:26.440 --> 31:30.520\n And oftentimes these worries are just,\n\n31:30.520 --> 31:32.880\n they just get in the way of progress.\n\n31:32.880 --> 31:36.680\n And they're questions that we should address later.\n\n31:37.680 --> 31:41.960\n And I think I talk about this in my interview\n\n31:41.960 --> 31:46.960\n with the self driving autonomous vehicle guy,\n\n31:47.440 --> 31:48.640\n as I think it was a bonus scene\n\n31:48.640 --> 31:52.080\n from the trolley problem episode.\n\n31:52.080 --> 31:54.200\n And I'm like, wow, what should a car do\n\n31:54.200 --> 31:56.960\n if this really weird contrived scenario happens\n\n31:56.960 --> 32:00.120\n where it has to swerve and save the driver, but kill a kid?\n\n32:00.120 --> 32:03.440\n And he's like, well, what would a human do?\n\n32:03.440 --> 32:07.200\n And if we resist technological progress\n\n32:07.200 --> 32:10.360\n because we're worried about all of these little issues,\n\n32:10.360 --> 32:11.960\n then it gets in the way.\n\n32:11.960 --> 32:14.320\n And we shouldn't avoid those problems,\n\n32:14.320 --> 32:16.760\n but we shouldn't allow them to be stumbling blocks\n\n32:16.760 --> 32:18.920\n to advancement.\n\n32:18.920 --> 32:22.440\n So the folks like Sam Harris or Elon Musk\n\n32:22.440 --> 32:24.520\n are saying that we're not worried enough.\n\n32:24.520 --> 32:28.520\n So the worry should not paralyze technological progress,\n\n32:28.520 --> 32:30.760\n but we're sort of marching,\n\n32:30.760 --> 32:35.760\n technology is marching forward without the key scientists,\n\n32:35.800 --> 32:37.880\n the developing of technology,\n\n32:37.880 --> 32:42.080\n worrying about the overnight having some effects\n\n32:42.080 --> 32:45.200\n that would be very detrimental to society.\n\n32:45.200 --> 32:49.520\n So to push back on your thought of the idea\n\n32:49.520 --> 32:51.240\n that there's enough people worrying about it,\n\n32:51.240 --> 32:53.040\n Elon Musk says, there's not enough people\n\n32:53.040 --> 32:54.640\n worrying about it.\n\n32:54.640 --> 32:56.580\n That's the kind of balance is,\n\n32:58.960 --> 33:01.240\n it's like folks who are really focused\n\n33:01.240 --> 33:03.680\n on nuclear deterrence are saying\n\n33:03.680 --> 33:04.840\n there's not enough people worried\n\n33:04.840 --> 33:06.080\n about nuclear deterrence, right?\n\n33:06.080 --> 33:10.220\n So it's an interesting question of what is a good threshold\n\n33:10.220 --> 33:12.600\n of people to worry about these?\n\n33:12.600 --> 33:15.160\n And if it's too many people that are worried, you're right.\n\n33:15.160 --> 33:18.720\n It'll be like the press would over report on it\n\n33:18.720 --> 33:21.840\n and there'll be technological, halt technological progress.\n\n33:21.840 --> 33:24.440\n If not enough, then we can march straight ahead\n\n33:24.440 --> 33:29.440\n into that abyss that human beings might be destined for\n\n33:29.840 --> 33:31.320\n with the progress of technology.\n\n33:31.320 --> 33:33.680\n Yeah, I don't know what the right balance is\n\n33:33.680 --> 33:35.720\n of how many people should be worried\n\n33:35.720 --> 33:36.960\n and how worried should they be,\n\n33:36.960 --> 33:40.440\n but we're always worried about new technology.\n\n33:40.440 --> 33:42.960\n We know that Plato was worried about the written word.\n\n33:42.960 --> 33:45.000\n He was like, we shouldn't teach people to write\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:48.360\n because then they won't use their minds to remember things.\n\n33:48.360 --> 33:51.240\n There have been concerns over technology\n\n33:51.240 --> 33:55.120\n and its advancement since the beginning of recorded history.\n\n33:55.120 --> 33:58.880\n And so, I think, however,\n\n33:58.880 --> 34:01.060\n these conversations are really important to have\n\n34:01.060 --> 34:03.360\n because again, we learn a lot about ourselves.\n\n34:03.360 --> 34:06.200\n If we're really scared of some kind of AI\n\n34:06.200 --> 34:09.360\n like coming into being that is conscious or whatever\n\n34:09.360 --> 34:13.120\n and can self replicate, we already do that every day.\n\n34:13.120 --> 34:14.560\n It's called humans being born.\n\n34:14.560 --> 34:17.200\n They're not artificial, they're humans,\n\n34:17.200 --> 34:20.140\n but they're intelligent and I don't wanna live in a world\n\n34:20.140 --> 34:21.940\n where we're worried about babies being born\n\n34:21.940 --> 34:24.200\n because what if they become evil?\n\n34:24.200 --> 34:25.040\n Right.\n\n34:25.040 --> 34:25.920\n What if they become mean people?\n\n34:25.920 --> 34:27.680\n What if they're thieves?\n\n34:27.680 --> 34:31.760\n Maybe we should just like, what, not have babies born?\n\n34:31.760 --> 34:33.980\n Like maybe we shouldn't create AI.\n\n34:33.980 --> 34:38.980\n It's like, we will want to have safeguards in place\n\n34:39.720 --> 34:41.740\n in the same way that we know, look,\n\n34:41.740 --> 34:44.400\n a kid could be born that becomes some kind of evil person,\n\n34:44.400 --> 34:47.880\n but we have laws, right?\n\n34:47.880 --> 34:51.600\n And it's possible that with advanced genetics in general,\n\n34:51.600 --> 34:56.600\n be able to, it's a scary thought to say that,\n\n34:58.400 --> 35:03.400\n this, my child, if born would have an 83% chance\n\n35:05.200 --> 35:08.720\n of being a psychopath, right?\n\n35:08.720 --> 35:11.500\n Like being able to, if it's something genetic,\n\n35:11.500 --> 35:15.040\n if there's some sort of, and what to use that information,\n\n35:15.040 --> 35:16.200\n what to do with that information\n\n35:16.200 --> 35:20.000\n is a difficult ethical thought.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.040\n Yeah, and I'd like to find an answer that isn't,\n\n35:22.040 --> 35:24.940\n well, let's not have them live.\n\n35:24.940 --> 35:26.860\n You know, I'd like to find an answer that is,\n\n35:26.860 --> 35:30.340\n well, all human life is worthy.\n\n35:30.340 --> 35:33.640\n And if you have an 83% chance of becoming a psychopath,\n\n35:33.640 --> 35:38.140\n well, you still deserve dignity.\n\n35:38.140 --> 35:42.400\n And you still deserve to be treated well.\n\n35:42.400 --> 35:43.360\n You still have rights.\n\n35:43.360 --> 35:45.980\n At least at this part of the world, at least in America,\n\n35:45.980 --> 35:49.540\n there's a respect for individual life in that way.\n\n35:49.540 --> 35:54.040\n That's, well, to me, but again, I'm in this bubble,\n\n35:54.040 --> 35:55.760\n is a beautiful thing.\n\n35:55.760 --> 35:59.020\n But there's other cultures where individual human life\n\n35:59.020 --> 36:02.720\n is not that important, where a society,\n\n36:02.720 --> 36:04.760\n so I was born in the Soviet Union,\n\n36:04.760 --> 36:07.440\n where the strength of nation and society together\n\n36:07.440 --> 36:10.280\n is more important than any one particular individual.\n\n36:10.280 --> 36:12.080\n So it's an interesting also notion,\n\n36:12.080 --> 36:13.540\n the stories we tell ourselves.\n\n36:13.540 --> 36:16.000\n I like the one where individuals matter,\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:19.200\n but it's unclear that that was what the future holds.\n\n36:19.200 --> 36:21.480\n Well, yeah, and I mean, let me even throw this out.\n\n36:21.480 --> 36:23.840\n Like, what is artificial intelligence?\n\n36:23.840 --> 36:25.200\n How can it be artificial?\n\n36:25.200 --> 36:28.000\n I really think that we get pretty obsessed\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.740\n and stuck on the idea that there is some thing\n\n36:30.740 --> 36:34.320\n that is a wild human, a pure human organism\n\n36:34.320 --> 36:35.780\n without technology.\n\n36:35.780 --> 36:37.540\n But I don't think that's a real thing.\n\n36:37.540 --> 36:42.540\n I think that humans and human technology are one organism.\n\n36:42.780 --> 36:44.500\n Look at my glasses, okay?\n\n36:44.500 --> 36:47.860\n If an alien came down and saw me,\n\n36:47.860 --> 36:50.620\n would they necessarily know that this is an invention,\n\n36:50.620 --> 36:53.220\n that I don't grow these organically from my body?\n\n36:53.220 --> 36:55.460\n They wouldn't know that right away.\n\n36:55.460 --> 37:00.460\n And the written word, and spoons, and cups,\n\n37:00.460 --> 37:02.460\n these are all pieces of technology.\n\n37:02.460 --> 37:06.700\n We are not alone as an organism.\n\n37:06.700 --> 37:09.060\n And so the technology we create,\n\n37:09.060 --> 37:11.980\n whether it be video games or artificial intelligence\n\n37:11.980 --> 37:14.020\n that can self replicate and hate us,\n\n37:14.020 --> 37:16.780\n it's actually all the same organism.\n\n37:16.780 --> 37:19.220\n When you're in a car, where do you end in the car begin?\n\n37:19.220 --> 37:21.100\n It seems like a really easy question to answer,\n\n37:21.100 --> 37:22.660\n but the more you think about it,\n\n37:22.660 --> 37:23.900\n the more you realize, wow,\n\n37:23.900 --> 37:27.940\n we are in this symbiotic relationship with our inventions.\n\n37:27.940 --> 37:30.020\n And there are plenty of people who are worried about it.\n\n37:30.020 --> 37:30.860\n And there should be,\n\n37:30.860 --> 37:32.820\n but it's inevitable.\n\n37:32.820 --> 37:35.900\n And I think that even just us think of ourselves\n\n37:35.900 --> 37:40.900\n as individual intelligences may be silly notion\n\n37:41.380 --> 37:44.540\n because it's much better to think\n\n37:44.540 --> 37:46.780\n of the entirety of human civilization.\n\n37:46.780 --> 37:50.740\n All living organisms on earth is a single living organism.\n\n37:50.740 --> 37:52.180\n As a single intelligent creature,\n\n37:52.180 --> 37:54.340\n because you're right, everything's intertwined.\n\n37:54.340 --> 37:57.100\n Everything is deeply connected.\n\n37:57.100 --> 37:57.940\n So we mentioned, you know,\n\n37:57.940 --> 38:02.940\n Musk, so you're a curious lover of science.\n\n38:03.140 --> 38:06.860\n What do you think of the efforts that Elon Musk is doing\n\n38:06.860 --> 38:10.100\n with space exploration, with electric vehicles,\n\n38:10.100 --> 38:13.620\n with autopilot, sort of getting into the space\n\n38:13.620 --> 38:17.300\n of autonomous vehicles, with boring under LA\n\n38:17.300 --> 38:21.740\n and a Neuralink trying to communicate brain machine\n\n38:21.740 --> 38:24.260\n interfaces, communicate between machines\n\n38:24.260 --> 38:28.540\n and human brains?\n\n38:28.540 --> 38:30.140\n Well, it's really inspiring.\n\n38:30.140 --> 38:34.860\n I mean, look at the fandom that he's amassed.\n\n38:34.860 --> 38:39.220\n It's not common for someone like that\n\n38:39.220 --> 38:40.620\n to have such a following.\n\n38:40.620 --> 38:42.420\n And so it's... Engineering nerd.\n\n38:42.420 --> 38:44.580\n Yeah, so it's really exciting.\n\n38:44.580 --> 38:46.420\n But I also think that a lot of responsibility\n\n38:46.420 --> 38:47.660\n comes with that kind of power.\n\n38:47.660 --> 38:50.860\n So like if I met him, I would love to hear how he feels\n\n38:50.860 --> 38:53.420\n about the responsibility he has.\n\n38:53.420 --> 38:58.420\n When there are people who are such a fan of your ideas\n\n38:59.980 --> 39:04.620\n and your dreams and share them so closely with you,\n\n39:04.620 --> 39:06.420\n you have a lot of power.\n\n39:06.420 --> 39:09.660\n And he didn't always have that, you know?\n\n39:09.660 --> 39:11.980\n He wasn't born as Elon Musk.\n\n39:11.980 --> 39:13.980\n Well, he was, but well, he was named that later.\n\n39:13.980 --> 39:18.980\n But the point is that I wanna know the psychology\n\n39:18.980 --> 39:23.860\n of becoming a figure like him.\n\n39:23.860 --> 39:25.660\n Well, I don't even know how to phrase the question right,\n\n39:25.660 --> 39:27.980\n but it's a question about what do you do\n\n39:27.980 --> 39:32.980\n when you're following, your fans become so large\n\n39:35.780 --> 39:37.980\n that it's almost bigger than you.\n\n39:37.980 --> 39:41.020\n And how do you responsibly manage that?\n\n39:41.020 --> 39:42.180\n And maybe it doesn't worry him at all.\n\n39:42.180 --> 39:43.500\n And that's fine too.\n\n39:43.500 --> 39:45.500\n But I'd be really curious.\n\n39:45.500 --> 39:47.660\n And I think there are a lot of people that go through this\n\n39:47.660 --> 39:50.380\n when they realize, whoa, there are a lot of eyes on me.\n\n39:50.380 --> 39:53.900\n There are a lot of people who really take what I say\n\n39:53.900 --> 39:57.700\n very earnestly and take it to heart and will defend me.\n\n39:57.700 --> 40:02.700\n And whew, that's, that's, that can be dangerous.\n\n40:04.260 --> 40:07.500\n And you have to be responsible with it.\n\n40:07.500 --> 40:09.260\n Both in terms of impact on society\n\n40:09.260 --> 40:11.260\n and psychologically for the individual,\n\n40:11.260 --> 40:15.020\n just the burden psychologically on Elon?\n\n40:15.020 --> 40:18.820\n Yeah, yeah, how does he think about that?\n\n40:18.820 --> 40:21.180\n Part of his persona.\n\n40:21.180 --> 40:23.340\n Well, let me throw that right back at you\n\n40:23.340 --> 40:27.500\n because in some ways you're just a funny guy\n\n40:28.540 --> 40:31.660\n that gotten a humongous following,\n\n40:31.660 --> 40:33.540\n a funny guy with a curiosity.\n\n40:34.900 --> 40:36.540\n You've got a huge following.\n\n40:36.540 --> 40:40.060\n How do you psychologically deal with the responsibility?\n\n40:40.060 --> 40:41.980\n In many ways you have a reach\n\n40:41.980 --> 40:44.540\n in many ways bigger than Elon Musk.\n\n40:44.540 --> 40:49.340\n What is your, what is the burden that you feel in educating\n\n40:49.340 --> 40:51.980\n being one of the biggest educators in the world\n\n40:51.980 --> 40:53.500\n where everybody's listening to you\n\n40:53.500 --> 40:58.380\n and actually everybody, like most of the world\n\n40:58.380 --> 41:01.060\n that's uses YouTube for educational material,\n\n41:01.060 --> 41:06.000\n trust you as a source of good, strong scientific thinking.\n\n41:07.540 --> 41:11.020\n It's a burden and I try to approach it\n\n41:11.020 --> 41:16.020\n with a lot of humility and sharing.\n\n41:16.020 --> 41:18.580\n Like I'm not out there doing\n\n41:18.580 --> 41:20.300\n a lot of scientific experiments.\n\n41:20.300 --> 41:23.180\n I am sharing the work of real scientists\n\n41:23.180 --> 41:26.420\n and I'm celebrating their work and the way that they think\n\n41:26.420 --> 41:29.500\n and the power of curiosity.\n\n41:29.500 --> 41:32.200\n But I wanna make it clear at all times that like,\n\n41:32.200 --> 41:35.260\n look, we don't know all the answers\n\n41:35.260 --> 41:37.660\n and I don't think we're ever going to reach a point\n\n41:37.660 --> 41:39.500\n where we're like, wow, and there you go.\n\n41:39.500 --> 41:40.620\n That's the universe.\n\n41:40.620 --> 41:43.820\n It's this equation, you plug in some conditions or whatever\n\n41:43.820 --> 41:44.660\n and you do the math\n\n41:44.660 --> 41:46.100\n and you know what's gonna happen tomorrow.\n\n41:46.100 --> 41:47.920\n I don't think we're ever gonna reach that point,\n\n41:47.920 --> 41:51.920\n but I think that there is a tendency\n\n41:51.920 --> 41:56.100\n to sometimes believe in science and become elitist\n\n41:56.100 --> 41:58.860\n and become, I don't know, hard when in reality\n\n41:58.860 --> 42:01.780\n it should humble you and make you feel smaller.\n\n42:01.780 --> 42:03.080\n I think there's something very beautiful\n\n42:03.080 --> 42:07.420\n about feeling very, very small and very weak\n\n42:07.420 --> 42:10.940\n and to feel that you need other people.\n\n42:10.940 --> 42:13.220\n So I try to keep that in mind and say,\n\n42:13.220 --> 42:14.340\n look, thanks for watching.\n\n42:14.340 --> 42:16.700\n Vsauce is not, I'm not Vsauce, you are.\n\n42:16.700 --> 42:18.080\n When I start the episodes, I say,\n\n42:18.080 --> 42:20.500\n hey, Vsauce, Michael here.\n\n42:20.500 --> 42:22.260\n Vsauce and Michael are actually a different thing\n\n42:22.260 --> 42:23.100\n in my mind.\n\n42:23.100 --> 42:24.380\n I don't know if that's always clear,\n\n42:24.380 --> 42:26.900\n but yeah, I have to approach it that way\n\n42:26.900 --> 42:29.040\n because it's not about me.\n\n42:30.080 --> 42:31.860\n Yeah, so it's not even,\n\n42:31.860 --> 42:33.620\n you're not feeling the responsibility.\n\n42:33.620 --> 42:36.100\n You're just sort of plugging into this big thing\n\n42:36.100 --> 42:40.020\n that is scientific exploration of our reality\n\n42:40.020 --> 42:42.660\n and you're a voice that represents a bunch,\n\n42:42.660 --> 42:47.660\n but you're just plugging into this big Vsauce ball\n\n42:47.660 --> 42:49.860\n that others, millions of others are plugged into.\n\n42:49.860 --> 42:53.060\n Yeah, and I'm just hoping to encourage curiosity\n\n42:53.060 --> 42:56.380\n and responsible thinking\n\n42:56.380 --> 43:01.380\n and an embracement of doubt\n\n43:01.980 --> 43:05.020\n and being okay with that.\n\n43:05.020 --> 43:08.200\n So I'm next week talking to Christos Gudrow.\n\n43:08.200 --> 43:09.980\n I'm not sure if you're familiar who he is,\n\n43:09.980 --> 43:11.660\n but he's the VP of engineering,\n\n43:11.660 --> 43:14.660\n head of the quote unquote YouTube algorithm\n\n43:14.660 --> 43:16.140\n or the search and discovery.\n\n43:16.140 --> 43:20.180\n So let me ask, first high level,\n\n43:20.180 --> 43:25.100\n do you have a question for him\n\n43:25.100 --> 43:28.860\n that if you can get an honest answer that you would ask,\n\n43:28.860 --> 43:30.140\n but more generally,\n\n43:30.140 --> 43:32.620\n how do you think about the YouTube algorithm\n\n43:32.620 --> 43:36.060\n that drives some of the motivation behind,\n\n43:36.060 --> 43:38.900\n no, some of the design decisions you make\n\n43:38.900 --> 43:42.220\n as you ask and answer some of the questions you do,\n\n43:42.220 --> 43:45.140\n how would you improve this algorithm in your mind in general?\n\n43:45.140 --> 43:47.540\n So just what would you ask him?\n\n43:47.540 --> 43:49.500\n And outside of that,\n\n43:49.500 --> 43:52.700\n how would you like to see the algorithm improve?\n\n43:52.700 --> 43:56.780\n Well, I think of the algorithm as a mirror.\n\n43:56.780 --> 43:58.940\n It reflects what people put in\n\n43:58.940 --> 44:01.140\n and we don't always like what we see in that mirror.\n\n44:01.140 --> 44:02.780\n From the individual mirror\n\n44:02.780 --> 44:05.420\n to the individual mirror to the society.\n\n44:05.420 --> 44:07.020\n Both, in the aggregate,\n\n44:07.020 --> 44:11.380\n it's reflecting back what people on average want to watch.\n\n44:11.380 --> 44:15.340\n And when you see things being recommended to you,\n\n44:15.340 --> 44:19.220\n it's reflecting back what it thinks you want to see.\n\n44:19.220 --> 44:22.300\n And specifically, I would guess that it's\n\n44:22.300 --> 44:23.560\n not just what you want to see,\n\n44:23.560 --> 44:25.560\n but what you will click on\n\n44:25.560 --> 44:30.560\n and what you will watch some of and stay on YouTube\n\n44:30.560 --> 44:32.480\n because of.\n\n44:32.480 --> 44:34.860\n I don't think that, this is all me guessing,\n\n44:34.860 --> 44:38.980\n but I don't think that YouTube cares\n\n44:38.980 --> 44:41.700\n if you only watch like a second of a video,\n\n44:41.700 --> 44:45.100\n as long as the next thing you do is open another video.\n\n44:45.100 --> 44:49.380\n If you close the app or close the site,\n\n44:49.380 --> 44:50.780\n that's a problem for them\n\n44:50.780 --> 44:52.940\n because they're not a subscription platform.\n\n44:52.940 --> 44:53.780\n They're not like, look,\n\n44:53.780 --> 44:56.120\n you're giving us 20 bucks a month no matter what,\n\n44:56.120 --> 44:57.620\n so who cares?\n\n44:57.620 --> 45:02.100\n They need you to watch and spend time there and see ads.\n\n45:02.100 --> 45:03.620\n So one of the things I'm curious about\n\n45:03.620 --> 45:08.620\n whether they do consider longer term sort of develop,\n\n45:09.980 --> 45:12.600\n your longer term development as a human being,\n\n45:12.600 --> 45:15.100\n which I think ultimately will make you feel better\n\n45:15.100 --> 45:17.460\n about using YouTube in the longterm\n\n45:17.460 --> 45:19.920\n and allowing you to stick with it for longer.\n\n45:19.920 --> 45:23.300\n Because even if you feed the dopamine rush in the short term\n\n45:23.300 --> 45:25.580\n and you keep clicking on cat videos,\n\n45:25.580 --> 45:28.980\n eventually you sort of wake up like from a drug\n\n45:28.980 --> 45:30.860\n and say, I need to quit this.\n\n45:30.860 --> 45:32.700\n So I wonder how much you're trying to optimize\n\n45:32.700 --> 45:35.820\n for the longterm because when I look at the,\n\n45:35.820 --> 45:39.420\n your videos aren't exactly sort of, no offense,\n\n45:39.420 --> 45:41.740\n but they're not the most clickable.\n\n45:41.740 --> 45:44.180\n They're both the most clickable\n\n45:44.180 --> 45:47.260\n and I feel I watched the entire thing\n\n45:47.260 --> 45:49.640\n and I feel a better human after I watched it, right?\n\n45:49.640 --> 45:54.640\n So like they're not just optimizing for the clickability\n\n45:54.640 --> 45:59.640\n because I hope, so my thought is how do you think of it?\n\n45:59.880 --> 46:02.240\n And does it affect your own content?\n\n46:02.240 --> 46:03.280\n Like how deep you go,\n\n46:03.280 --> 46:07.000\n how profound you explore the directions and so on.\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:11.500\n I've been really lucky in that I don't worry too much\n\n46:11.500 --> 46:12.520\n about the algorithm.\n\n46:12.520 --> 46:13.800\n I mean, look at my thumbnails.\n\n46:13.800 --> 46:17.200\n I don't really go too wild with them.\n\n46:17.200 --> 46:19.800\n And with minefield where I'm in partnership with YouTube\n\n46:19.800 --> 46:22.400\n on the thumbnails, I'm often like, let's pull this back.\n\n46:22.400 --> 46:23.960\n Let's be mysterious.\n\n46:23.960 --> 46:25.640\n But usually I'm just trying to do\n\n46:25.640 --> 46:27.520\n what everyone else is not doing.\n\n46:27.520 --> 46:30.960\n So if everyone's doing crazy Photoshop kind of thumbnails,\n\n46:30.960 --> 46:34.120\n I'm like, what if the thumbnails just a line?\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:37.760\n And what if the title is just a word?\n\n46:37.760 --> 46:41.160\n And I kind of feel like all of the Vsauce channels\n\n46:41.160 --> 46:43.160\n have cultivated an audience that expects that.\n\n46:43.160 --> 46:45.340\n And so they would rather Jake make a video\n\n46:45.340 --> 46:48.440\n that's just called stains than one called,\n\n46:48.440 --> 46:50.920\n I explored stains, shocking.\n\n46:50.920 --> 46:53.300\n But there are other audiences out there that want that.\n\n46:53.300 --> 46:57.080\n And I think most people kind of want\n\n46:57.080 --> 46:58.800\n what you see the algorithm favoring,\n\n46:58.800 --> 47:02.240\n which is mainstream traditional celebrity\n\n47:02.240 --> 47:03.640\n and news kind of information.\n\n47:03.640 --> 47:05.200\n I mean, that's what makes YouTube really different\n\n47:05.200 --> 47:06.680\n than other streaming platforms.\n\n47:06.680 --> 47:08.800\n No one's like, what's going on in the world?\n\n47:08.800 --> 47:10.520\n I'll open up Netflix to find out.\n\n47:10.520 --> 47:12.720\n But you do open up Twitter to find that out.\n\n47:12.720 --> 47:14.840\n You open up Facebook and you can open up YouTube\n\n47:14.840 --> 47:16.260\n because you'll see that the trending videos\n\n47:16.260 --> 47:20.240\n are like what happened amongst the traditional mainstream\n\n47:20.240 --> 47:22.120\n people in different industries.\n\n47:22.120 --> 47:24.040\n And that's what's being shown.\n\n47:24.040 --> 47:27.560\n And it's not necessarily YouTube saying,\n\n47:27.560 --> 47:29.240\n we want that to be what you see.\n\n47:29.240 --> 47:31.400\n It's that that's what people click on.\n\n47:31.400 --> 47:33.320\n When they see Ariana Grande, you know,\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:36.280\n reads a love letter from like her high school sweetheart,\n\n47:36.280 --> 47:38.000\n they're like, I wanna see that.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.320\n And when they see a video from me\n\n47:39.320 --> 47:41.800\n that's got some lines in math and it's called law and causes\n\n47:41.800 --> 47:45.940\n they're like, well, I mean, I'm just on the bus.\n\n47:45.940 --> 47:48.640\n Like I don't have time to dive into a whole lesson.\n\n47:48.640 --> 47:52.360\n So, you know, before you get super mad at YouTube,\n\n47:52.360 --> 47:53.640\n you should say, really,\n\n47:53.640 --> 47:55.520\n they're just reflecting back human behavior.\n\n47:55.520 --> 47:59.040\n Is there something you would improve about the algorithm\n\n48:00.240 --> 48:02.760\n knowing of course, that as far as we're concerned,\n\n48:02.760 --> 48:04.600\n it's a black box, so we don't know how it works.\n\n48:04.600 --> 48:06.760\n Right, and I don't think that even anyone at YouTube\n\n48:06.760 --> 48:07.920\n really knows what it's doing.\n\n48:07.920 --> 48:09.800\n They know what they've tweaked, but then it learns.\n\n48:09.800 --> 48:13.800\n I think that it learns and it decides how to behave.\n\n48:13.800 --> 48:16.640\n And sometimes the YouTube employees are left going,\n\n48:16.640 --> 48:17.740\n I don't know.\n\n48:17.740 --> 48:19.600\n Maybe we should like change the value\n\n48:19.600 --> 48:22.640\n of how much it, you know, worries about watch time.\n\n48:22.640 --> 48:24.800\n And maybe it should worry more about something else.\n\n48:24.800 --> 48:25.640\n I don't know.\n\n48:25.640 --> 48:27.400\n But I mean, I would like to see,\n\n48:28.400 --> 48:30.680\n I don't know what they're doing and not doing.\n\n48:30.680 --> 48:32.740\n Well, is there a conversation\n\n48:32.740 --> 48:35.720\n that you think they should be having just internally,\n\n48:35.720 --> 48:37.300\n whether they're having it or not?\n\n48:37.300 --> 48:38.920\n Is there something,\n\n48:38.920 --> 48:41.140\n should they be thinking about the longterm future?\n\n48:41.140 --> 48:44.440\n Should they be thinking about educational content\n\n48:44.440 --> 48:48.160\n and whether that's educating about what just happened\n\n48:48.160 --> 48:50.680\n in the world today, news or educational content,\n\n48:50.680 --> 48:51.520\n like what you're providing,\n\n48:51.520 --> 48:54.360\n which is asking big sort of timeless questions\n\n48:54.360 --> 48:56.580\n about how the way the world works.\n\n48:56.580 --> 48:58.120\n Well, it's interesting.\n\n48:58.120 --> 48:59.400\n What should they think about?\n\n48:59.400 --> 49:02.620\n Because it's called YouTube, not our tube.\n\n49:02.620 --> 49:04.680\n And that's why I think they have\n\n49:04.680 --> 49:08.360\n so many phenomenal educational creators.\n\n49:08.360 --> 49:11.720\n You don't have shows like Three Blue One Brown\n\n49:11.720 --> 49:14.960\n or Physics Girl or Looking Glass Universe or Up and Atom\n\n49:14.960 --> 49:18.720\n or Brain Scoop or, I mean, I could go on and on.\n\n49:18.720 --> 49:21.200\n They aren't on Amazon Prime and Netflix\n\n49:21.200 --> 49:24.000\n and they don't have commissioned shows from those platforms.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:25.520\n It's all organically happening\n\n49:25.520 --> 49:26.660\n because there are people out there\n\n49:26.660 --> 49:30.140\n that want to share their passion for learning,\n\n49:30.140 --> 49:32.520\n that wanna share their curiosity.\n\n49:32.520 --> 49:37.440\n And YouTube could promote those kinds of shows more,\n\n49:37.440 --> 49:42.440\n but first of all, they probably wouldn't get as many clicks\n\n49:43.240 --> 49:45.340\n and YouTube needs to make sure that the average user\n\n49:45.340 --> 49:47.720\n is always clicking and staying on the site.\n\n49:47.720 --> 49:51.060\n They could still promote it more for the good of society,\n\n49:51.060 --> 49:52.720\n but then we're making some really weird claims\n\n49:52.720 --> 49:53.960\n about what's good for society\n\n49:53.960 --> 49:55.600\n because I think that cat videos\n\n49:55.600 --> 49:58.040\n are also an incredibly important part\n\n49:58.040 --> 50:00.360\n of what it means to be a human.\n\n50:00.360 --> 50:02.860\n I mentioned this quote before from Unumuno about,\n\n50:02.860 --> 50:05.400\n look, I've seen a cat like estimate distances\n\n50:05.400 --> 50:09.440\n and calculate a jump more often than I've seen a cat cry.\n\n50:09.440 --> 50:12.440\n And so things that play with our emotions\n\n50:12.440 --> 50:15.360\n and make us feel things can be cheesy and can feel cheap,\n\n50:15.360 --> 50:18.000\n but like, man, that's very human.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:23.000\n And so even the dumbest vlog is still so important\n\n50:23.760 --> 50:27.380\n that I don't think I have a better claim to take its spot\n\n50:27.380 --> 50:29.840\n than it has to have that spot.\n\n50:29.840 --> 50:32.600\n It puts a mirror to us, the beautiful parts,\n\n50:32.600 --> 50:35.880\n the ugly parts, the shallow parts, the deep parts.\n\n50:35.880 --> 50:36.720\n You're right.\n\n50:36.720 --> 50:38.520\n What I would like to see is,\n\n50:39.840 --> 50:43.360\n I miss the days when engaging with content on YouTube\n\n50:43.360 --> 50:47.620\n helped push it into my subscribers timelines.\n\n50:47.620 --> 50:49.560\n It used to be that when I liked a video,\n\n50:49.560 --> 50:54.560\n say from Veritasium, it would show up in the feed\n\n50:54.620 --> 50:58.340\n on the front page of the app or the website of my subscribers.\n\n50:58.340 --> 51:00.440\n And I knew that if I liked a video,\n\n51:00.440 --> 51:03.480\n I could send it 100,000 views or more.\n\n51:03.480 --> 51:05.360\n That no longer is true,\n\n51:05.360 --> 51:07.300\n but I think that was a good user experience.\n\n51:07.300 --> 51:09.800\n When I subscribe to someone, when I'm following them,\n\n51:09.800 --> 51:13.060\n I want to see more of what they like.\n\n51:13.060 --> 51:15.360\n I want them to also curate the feed for me.\n\n51:15.360 --> 51:17.900\n And I think that Twitter and Facebook are doing that\n\n51:17.900 --> 51:20.320\n in also some ways that are kind of annoying,\n\n51:20.320 --> 51:22.340\n but I would like that to happen more.\n\n51:22.340 --> 51:25.160\n And I think we would see communities being stronger\n\n51:25.160 --> 51:27.300\n on YouTube if it was that way instead of YouTube going,\n\n51:27.300 --> 51:29.760\n well, technically Michael liked this Veritasium video,\n\n51:29.760 --> 51:33.620\n but people are way more likely to click on Carpool Karaoke.\n\n51:33.620 --> 51:36.200\n So I don't even care who they are, just give them that.\n\n51:36.200 --> 51:38.960\n Not saying anything against Carpool Karaoke,\n\n51:38.960 --> 51:43.260\n that is a extremely important part of our society,\n\n51:43.260 --> 51:46.780\n what it means to be a human on earth, you know, but.\n\n51:46.780 --> 51:48.440\n I'll say it sucks, but.\n\n51:48.440 --> 51:51.380\n Yeah, but a lot of people would disagree with you\n\n51:51.380 --> 51:53.860\n and they should be able to see as much of that as they want.\n\n51:53.860 --> 51:55.660\n And I think even people who don't think they like it\n\n51:55.660 --> 51:57.100\n should still be really aware of it\n\n51:57.100 --> 51:59.400\n because it's such an important thing.\n\n51:59.400 --> 52:00.900\n It's such an influential thing.\n\n52:00.900 --> 52:03.260\n But yeah, I just wish that like new channels I discover\n\n52:03.260 --> 52:04.340\n and that I subscribe to,\n\n52:04.340 --> 52:06.940\n I wish that my subscribers found out about that\n\n52:06.940 --> 52:10.020\n because especially in the education community,\n\n52:10.020 --> 52:11.580\n a rising tide floats all boats.\n\n52:11.580 --> 52:14.020\n If you watch a video from Numberphile,\n\n52:14.020 --> 52:16.740\n you're just more likely to want to watch an episode from me,\n\n52:16.740 --> 52:18.540\n whether it be on Vsauce1 or Ding.\n\n52:18.540 --> 52:21.840\n It's not competitive in the way that traditional TV was\n\n52:21.840 --> 52:23.180\n where it's like, well, if you tune into that show,\n\n52:23.180 --> 52:24.540\n it means you're not watching mine\n\n52:24.540 --> 52:26.140\n because they both air at the same time.\n\n52:26.140 --> 52:29.340\n So helping each other out through collaborations\n\n52:29.340 --> 52:30.180\n takes a lot of work,\n\n52:30.180 --> 52:32.820\n but just through engaging, commenting on their videos,\n\n52:32.820 --> 52:36.700\n liking their videos, subscribing to them, whatever,\n\n52:36.700 --> 52:41.500\n that I would love to see become easier and more powerful.\n\n52:41.500 --> 52:46.060\n So a quick and impossibly deep question,\n\n52:46.060 --> 52:48.980\n last question about mortality.\n\n52:48.980 --> 52:52.580\n You've spoken about death as an interesting topic.\n\n52:52.580 --> 52:55.940\n Do you think about your own mortality?\n\n52:55.940 --> 52:59.740\n Yeah, every day, it's really scary.\n\n52:59.740 --> 53:04.020\n So what do you think is the meaning of life\n\n53:04.020 --> 53:07.340\n that mortality makes very explicit?\n\n53:07.340 --> 53:12.340\n So why are you here on earth, Michael?\n\n53:12.620 --> 53:14.560\n What's the point of this whole thing?\n\n53:18.100 --> 53:23.100\n What does mortality in the context of the whole universe\n\n53:23.100 --> 53:26.400\n make you realize about yourself?\n\n53:26.400 --> 53:28.060\n Just you, Michael Stevens.\n\n53:29.140 --> 53:31.300\n Well, it makes me realize\n\n53:31.300 --> 53:35.620\n that I am destined to become a notion.\n\n53:35.620 --> 53:39.620\n I'm destined to become a memory and we can extend life.\n\n53:39.620 --> 53:42.900\n I think there's really exciting things being done\n\n53:42.900 --> 53:43.860\n to extend life,\n\n53:43.860 --> 53:47.100\n but we still don't know how to protect you\n\n53:47.100 --> 53:48.860\n from some accident that could happen,\n\n53:48.860 --> 53:50.300\n some unforeseen thing.\n\n53:50.300 --> 53:54.140\n Maybe we could save my connectome\n\n53:54.140 --> 53:56.580\n and recreate my consciousness digitally,\n\n53:56.580 --> 53:59.420\n but even that could be lost\n\n54:00.340 --> 54:02.580\n if it's stored on a physical medium or something.\n\n54:02.580 --> 54:05.580\n So basically, I just think that embracing\n\n54:07.780 --> 54:09.020\n and realizing how cool it is,\n\n54:09.020 --> 54:11.540\n that someday I will just be an idea.\n\n54:11.540 --> 54:13.380\n And there won't be a Michael anymore\n\n54:13.380 --> 54:16.180\n that can be like, no, that's not what I meant.\n\n54:16.180 --> 54:17.540\n It'll just be what people,\n\n54:17.540 --> 54:19.620\n they have to guess what I meant.\n\n54:19.620 --> 54:21.740\n And they'll remember me\n\n54:23.140 --> 54:25.780\n and how I live on as that memory\n\n54:25.780 --> 54:29.600\n will maybe not even be who I want it to be.\n\n54:29.600 --> 54:31.940\n But there's something powerful about that.\n\n54:31.940 --> 54:32.900\n And there's something powerful\n\n54:32.900 --> 54:37.900\n about letting future people run the show themselves.\n\n54:38.980 --> 54:41.980\n I think I'm glad to get out of their way at some point\n\n54:41.980 --> 54:43.660\n and say, all right, it's your world now.\n\n54:43.660 --> 54:47.300\n So you, the physical entity, Michael,\n\n54:47.300 --> 54:50.260\n have ripple effects in the space of ideas\n\n54:50.260 --> 54:54.260\n that far outlives you in ways that you can't control,\n\n54:54.260 --> 54:56.100\n but it's nevertheless fascinating to think,\n\n54:56.100 --> 54:57.580\n I mean, especially with you,\n\n54:57.580 --> 54:59.180\n you can imagine an alien species\n\n54:59.180 --> 55:01.740\n when they finally arrive and destroy all of us\n\n55:01.740 --> 55:04.580\n would watch your videos to try to figure out\n\n55:04.580 --> 55:05.980\n what were the questions that these people.\n\n55:05.980 --> 55:07.460\n But even if they didn't,\n\n55:08.620 --> 55:11.380\n I still think that there will be ripples.\n\n55:11.380 --> 55:13.420\n Like when I say memory,\n\n55:13.420 --> 55:16.580\n I don't specifically mean people remember my name\n\n55:16.580 --> 55:18.940\n and my birth date and like there's a photo of me\n\n55:18.940 --> 55:20.860\n on Wikipedia, like all that can be lost,\n\n55:20.860 --> 55:23.980\n but I still would hope that people ask questions\n\n55:23.980 --> 55:26.460\n and teach concepts in some of the ways\n\n55:26.460 --> 55:28.340\n that I have found useful and satisfying.\n\n55:28.340 --> 55:29.780\n Even if they don't know that I was the one\n\n55:29.780 --> 55:32.580\n who tried to popularize it, that's fine.\n\n55:32.580 --> 55:35.260\n But if Earth was completely destroyed,\n\n55:35.260 --> 55:39.340\n like burnt to a crisp, everything on it today,\n\n55:39.340 --> 55:42.700\n what would, the universe wouldn't care.\n\n55:42.700 --> 55:47.700\n Like Jupiter's not gonna go, oh no, and that could happen.\n\n55:49.980 --> 55:54.980\n So we do however have the power to launch things\n\n55:55.100 --> 56:00.100\n into space to try to extend how long our memory exists.\n\n56:02.900 --> 56:04.620\n And what I mean by that is,\n\n56:04.620 --> 56:06.900\n we are recording things about the world\n\n56:06.900 --> 56:08.420\n and we're learning things and writing stories\n\n56:08.420 --> 56:13.020\n and all of this and preserving that is truly\n\n56:13.020 --> 56:16.580\n what I think is the essence of being a human.\n\n56:16.580 --> 56:20.580\n We are autobiographers of the universe\n\n56:20.580 --> 56:21.660\n and we're really good at it.\n\n56:21.660 --> 56:22.940\n We're better than fossils.\n\n56:22.940 --> 56:25.500\n We're better than light spectrum.\n\n56:25.500 --> 56:26.740\n We're better than any of that.\n\n56:26.740 --> 56:29.980\n We collect much more detailed memories\n\n56:29.980 --> 56:32.820\n of what's happening, much better data.\n\n56:32.820 --> 56:37.300\n And so that should be our legacy.\n\n56:37.300 --> 56:40.140\n And I hope that that's kind of mine too\n\n56:40.140 --> 56:42.420\n in terms of people remembering something\n\n56:42.420 --> 56:44.780\n or having some kind of effect.\n\n56:44.780 --> 56:47.860\n But even if I don't, you can't not have an effect.\n\n56:47.860 --> 56:49.180\n This is not me feeling like,\n\n56:49.180 --> 56:50.820\n I hope that I have this powerful legacy.\n\n56:50.820 --> 56:53.820\n It's like, no matter who you are, you will.\n\n56:53.820 --> 56:57.700\n But you also have to embrace the fact\n\n56:57.700 --> 57:01.340\n that that impact might look really small and that's okay.\n\n57:01.340 --> 57:04.460\n One of my favorite quotes is from Tessa the Durbervilles.\n\n57:04.460 --> 57:08.220\n And it's along the lines of the measure of your life\n\n57:08.220 --> 57:10.940\n depends on not your external displacement\n\n57:10.940 --> 57:13.100\n but your subjective experience.\n\n57:13.100 --> 57:15.780\n If I am happy and those that I love are happy,\n\n57:16.700 --> 57:17.700\n can that be enough?\n\n57:17.700 --> 57:20.100\n Because if so, excellent.\n\n57:21.340 --> 57:23.460\n I think there's no better place to end it, Michael.\n\n57:23.460 --> 57:24.300\n Thank you so much.\n\n57:24.300 --> 57:25.140\n It was an honor to meet you.\n\n57:25.140 --> 57:25.980\n Thanks for talking to me.\n\n57:25.980 --> 57:27.660\n Thank you, it was a pleasure.\n\n57:27.660 --> 57:29.180\n Thanks for listening to this

words of wisdom\n\n57:58.580 --> 58:00.780\n from Albert Einstein.\n\n58:00.780 --> 58:03.980\n The important thing is not to stop questioning.\n\n58:03.980 --> 58:06.900\n Curiosity has its own reason for existence.\n\n58:06.900 --> 58:09.220\n One cannot help but be in awe\n\n58:09.220 --> 58:11.740\n when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity,\n\n58:11.740 --> 58:14.980\n of life, the marvelous structure of reality.\n\n58:14.980 --> 58:18.100\n It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend\n\n58:18.100 --> 58:20.140\n a little of this mystery every day.\n\n58:20.140 --> 58:32.820\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
