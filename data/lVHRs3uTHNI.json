biology\n\n00:06.380 --> 00:09.760\n at Harvard University and is interested in understanding\n\n00:09.760 --> 00:13.160\n the molecular laws that govern the birth, differentiation,\n\n00:13.160 --> 00:16.600\n and assembly of the human brain's cerebral cortex.\n\n00:16.600 --> 00:18.400\n She explores the complexity of the brain\n\n00:18.400 --> 00:21.000\n by studying and engineering elements\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:22.880\n of how the brain develops.\n\n00:22.880 --> 00:25.640\n This was a fascinating conversation to me.\n\n00:25.640 --> 00:28.560\n It's part of the Artificial Intelligence podcast.\n\n00:28.560 --> 00:30.600\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:30.600 --> 00:33.800\n give it five stars on iTunes, support it on Patreon,\n\n00:33.800 --> 00:35.800\n

Jeffress\n\n00:43.120 --> 00:45.560\n for her support of the podcast on Patreon.\n\n00:45.560 --> 00:47.660\n She's an artist and you should definitely check out\n\n00:47.660 --> 00:52.660\n her Instagram at lovetruthgood, three beautiful words.\n\n00:52.760 --> 00:55.640\n Your support means a lot and inspires me\n\n00:55.640 --> 00:57.720\n to keep the series going.\n\n00:57.720 --> 01:01.740\n And now here's my conversation with Paola Arlotta.\n\n01:03.120 --> 01:05.320\n You studied the development of the human brain\n\n01:05.320 --> 01:06.720\n for many years.\n\n01:06.720 --> 01:10.520\n So let me ask you an out of the box question first.\n\n01:11.480 --> 01:14.600\n How likely is it that there's intelligent life out there\n\n01:14.600 --> 01:17.160\n in the universe outside of earth\n\n01:17.160 --> 01:19.320\n with something like the human brain?\n\n01:19.320 --> 01:20.760\n So I can put it another way.\n\n01:20.760 --> 01:24.320\n How unlikely is the human brain?\n\n01:24.320 --> 01:28.320\n How difficult is it to build a thing\n\n01:28.320 --> 01:30.360\n through the evolutionary process?\n\n01:30.360 --> 01:32.480\n Well, it has happened here, right?\n\n01:32.480 --> 01:33.320\n On this planet.\n\n01:33.320 --> 01:34.160\n Once, yes.\n\n01:34.160 --> 01:35.000\n Once.\n\n01:36.320 --> 01:39.940\n So that simply tells you that it could, of course,\n\n01:39.940 --> 01:42.120\n happen again other places.\n\n01:42.120 --> 01:44.080\n It's only a matter of probability.\n\n01:44.080 --> 01:46.560\n What the probability that you would get a brain\n\n01:46.560 --> 01:51.200\n like the ones that we have, like the human brain.\n\n01:51.200 --> 01:53.960\n So how difficult is it to make the human brain?\n\n01:53.960 --> 01:57.880\n It's pretty difficult, but most importantly,\n\n01:59.040 --> 02:00.920\n I guess we know very little\n\n02:00.920 --> 02:04.400\n about how this process really happens.\n\n02:04.400 --> 02:06.280\n And there is a reason for that,\n\n02:06.280 --> 02:09.080\n actually multiple reasons for that.\n\n02:09.080 --> 02:13.280\n Most of what we know about how the mammalian brain,\n\n02:13.280 --> 02:17.000\n so the brain of mammals develop comes from studying\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.440\n in labs other brains, not our own brain,\n\n02:20.440 --> 02:22.520\n the brain of mice, for example.\n\n02:22.520 --> 02:25.360\n But if I showed you a picture of a mouse brain,\n\n02:25.360 --> 02:28.320\n and then you put it next to a picture of a human brain,\n\n02:28.320 --> 02:31.080\n they don't look at all like each other.\n\n02:31.080 --> 02:32.960\n So they're very different.\n\n02:32.960 --> 02:36.200\n And therefore there is a limit to what you can learn\n\n02:36.200 --> 02:37.880\n about how the human brain is made\n\n02:37.880 --> 02:39.720\n by studying the mouse brain.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:43.240\n There is a huge value in studying the mouse brain.\n\n02:43.240 --> 02:45.000\n There are many things that we have learned,\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.520\n but it's not the same thing.\n\n02:46.520 --> 02:49.120\n So in having studied the human brain,\n\n02:49.120 --> 02:51.360\n or through the mouse and through other methodologies\n\n02:51.360 --> 02:54.640\n that we'll talk about, do you have a sense?\n\n02:54.640 --> 02:57.440\n I mean, you're one of the experts in the world.\n\n02:57.440 --> 03:01.040\n How much do you feel you know about the brain\n\n03:01.040 --> 03:05.280\n and how often do you find yourself\n\n03:05.280 --> 03:07.720\n in awe of this mysterious thing?\n\n03:07.720 --> 03:12.120\n Yeah, you pretty much find yourself in awe all the time.\n\n03:12.120 --> 03:15.240\n It's an amazing process.\n\n03:15.240 --> 03:17.840\n It's a process by which,\n\n03:17.840 --> 03:20.640\n by means that we don't fully understand,\n\n03:20.640 --> 03:23.560\n at the very beginning of embryogenesis,\n\n03:23.560 --> 03:26.240\n the structure called the neural tube,\n\n03:26.240 --> 03:28.720\n literally self assembles.\n\n03:28.720 --> 03:30.360\n And it happens in an embryo\n\n03:30.360 --> 03:33.680\n and it can happen also from stem cells in a dish.\n\n03:33.680 --> 03:34.840\n Okay.\n\n03:34.840 --> 03:36.840\n And then from there,\n\n03:36.840 --> 03:39.800\n these stem cells that are present within the neural tube\n\n03:39.800 --> 03:42.200\n give rise to all of the thousands and thousands\n\n03:42.200 --> 03:45.040\n of different cell types that are present in the brain\n\n03:45.040 --> 03:46.480\n through time, right?\n\n03:46.480 --> 03:50.920\n With the interesting, very intriguing, interesting\n\n03:50.920 --> 03:54.880\n observation is that the time that it takes\n\n03:54.880 --> 03:58.760\n for the human brain to be made, it's human time.\n\n03:58.760 --> 04:02.120\n Meaning that for me and you,\n\n04:02.120 --> 04:05.240\n it took almost nine months of gestation to build the brain\n\n04:05.240 --> 04:08.680\n and then another 20 years of learning postnatally\n\n04:08.680 --> 04:09.960\n to get the brain that we have today\n\n04:09.960 --> 04:12.080\n that allows us to this conversation.\n\n04:12.080 --> 04:17.080\n A mouse takes 20 days or so for an embryo to be born.\n\n04:19.560 --> 04:23.760\n And so the brain is built in a much shorter period of time.\n\n04:23.760 --> 04:27.160\n And the beauty of it is that if you take mouse stem cells\n\n04:27.160 --> 04:28.880\n and you put them in a culture dish,\n\n04:29.840 --> 04:33.280\n the brain organoid that you get from a mouse\n\n04:33.280 --> 04:37.600\n is formed faster than if you took human stem cells\n\n04:37.600 --> 04:39.080\n and put them in the dish\n\n04:39.080 --> 04:41.960\n and let them make a human brain organoid.\n\n04:41.960 --> 04:45.520\n So the very developmental process is...\n\n04:45.520 --> 04:48.200\n Controlled by the speed of the species.\n\n04:49.040 --> 04:54.040\n Which means it's on purpose, it's not accidental\n\n04:54.040 --> 04:58.320\n or there is something in that temporal...\n\n04:58.320 --> 05:01.440\n It's very, exactly, that is very important\n\n05:01.440 --> 05:04.000\n for us to get the brain we have.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.080\n And we can speculate for why that is.\n\n05:08.080 --> 05:11.560\n You know, it takes us a long time as human beings\n\n05:11.560 --> 05:14.520\n after we're born to learn all the things\n\n05:14.520 --> 05:17.920\n that we have to learn to have the adult brain.\n\n05:17.920 --> 05:20.120\n It's actually 20 years, think about it.\n\n05:20.120 --> 05:23.400\n From when a baby is born to when a teenager\n\n05:23.400 --> 05:27.160\n goes through puberty to adults, it's a long time.\n\n05:27.160 --> 05:30.240\n Do you think you can maybe talk through\n\n05:30.240 --> 05:35.040\n the first few months and then on to the first 20 years\n\n05:35.040 --> 05:37.560\n and then for the rest of their lives?\n\n05:37.560 --> 05:41.080\n What is the development of the human brain look like?\n\n05:41.080 --> 05:42.480\n What are the different stages?\n\n05:42.480 --> 05:46.720\n Yeah, at the beginning, you have to build a brain, right?\n\n05:46.720 --> 05:48.840\n And the brain is made of cells.\n\n05:48.840 --> 05:49.760\n What's the very beginning?\n\n05:49.760 --> 05:52.000\n Which beginning are we talking about?\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\n In the embryo, as the embryo is developing in the womb,\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:58.520\n in addition to making all of the other tissues\n\n05:58.520 --> 06:02.040\n of the embryo, the muscle, the heart, the blood,\n\n06:02.040 --> 06:04.960\n the embryo is also building the brain.\n\n06:04.960 --> 06:08.440\n And it builds from a very simple structure\n\n06:08.440 --> 06:11.200\n called the neural tube, which is basically nothing\n\n06:11.200 --> 06:14.760\n but a tube of cells that spans sort of the length\n\n06:14.760 --> 06:18.480\n of the embryo from the head all the way to the tail,\n\n06:18.480 --> 06:19.920\n let's say, of the embryo.\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:25.520\n And then over in human beings, over many months of gestation\n\n06:25.520 --> 06:30.280\n from that neural tube, which contains stem cell\n\n06:30.280 --> 06:35.120\n like cells of the brain, you will make many, many\n\n06:35.120 --> 06:36.960\n other building blocks of the brain.\n\n06:36.960 --> 06:40.160\n So all of the other cell types, because there are many,\n\n06:40.160 --> 06:43.040\n many different types of cells in the brain\n\n06:43.040 --> 06:46.600\n that will form specific structures of the brain.\n\n06:46.600 --> 06:49.760\n So you can think about embryonic development of the brain\n\n06:49.760 --> 06:51.600\n as just the time in which you are making\n\n06:51.600 --> 06:54.400\n the building blocks, the cells.\n\n06:54.400 --> 06:57.600\n Are the stem cells relatively homogeneous, like uniform,\n\n06:57.600 --> 06:59.440\n or are they all different types?\n\n06:59.440 --> 07:00.280\n It's a very good question.\n\n07:00.280 --> 07:01.240\n It's exactly how it works.\n\n07:01.240 --> 07:04.160\n You start with a more homogeneous,\n\n07:04.160 --> 07:09.160\n perhaps more multipotent type of stem cell.\n\n07:09.160 --> 07:10.000\n With multipotent.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.520\n With multipotent it means that it has the potential\n\n07:13.520 --> 07:17.200\n to make many, many different types of other cells.\n\n07:17.200 --> 07:20.200\n And then with time, these progenitors become\n\n07:20.200 --> 07:22.840\n more heterogeneous, which means more diverse.\n\n07:22.840 --> 07:26.200\n There are gonna be many different types of the stem cells.\n\n07:26.200 --> 07:30.080\n And also they will give rise to progeny to other cells\n\n07:30.080 --> 07:32.880\n that are not stem cells, that are specific cells\n\n07:32.880 --> 07:34.200\n of the brain that are very different\n\n07:34.200 --> 07:35.880\n from the mother stem cell.\n\n07:35.880 --> 07:38.880\n And now you think about this process of making cells\n\n07:38.880 --> 07:41.560\n from the stem cells over many, many months\n\n07:41.560 --> 07:43.840\n of development for humans.\n\n07:43.840 --> 07:46.200\n And what you're doing, you're building the cells\n\n07:46.200 --> 07:48.240\n that physically make the brain,\n\n07:48.240 --> 07:52.440\n and then you arrange them in specific structures\n\n07:52.440 --> 07:55.480\n that are present in the final brain.\n\n07:55.480 --> 07:58.720\n So you can think about the embryonic development\n\n07:58.720 --> 08:02.160\n of the brain as the time where you're building the bricks,\n\n08:02.160 --> 08:05.560\n you're putting the bricks together to form buildings,\n\n08:05.560 --> 08:08.160\n structures, regions of the brain.\n\n08:08.160 --> 08:10.400\n And where you make the connections\n\n08:10.400 --> 08:13.080\n between these many different type of cells,\n\n08:13.080 --> 08:15.280\n especially nerve cells, neurons, right?\n\n08:15.280 --> 08:19.280\n That transmit action potentials and electricity.\n\n08:19.280 --> 08:21.360\n I've heard you also say somewhere, I think,\n\n08:21.360 --> 08:22.320\n correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n08:22.320 --> 08:25.160\n that the order of the way this builds matters.\n\n08:25.160 --> 08:26.080\n Oh yes.\n\n08:26.080 --> 08:29.920\n If you are an engineer and you think about development,\n\n08:29.920 --> 08:34.920\n you can think of it as, well, I could also take all the cells\n\n08:35.040 --> 08:38.000\n and bring them all together into a brain in the end.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.360\n But development is much more than that.\n\n08:40.360 --> 08:43.920\n So the cells are made in a very specific order\n\n08:43.920 --> 08:47.440\n that subserve the final product that you need to get.\n\n08:47.440 --> 08:49.920\n And so, for example, all of the nerve cells,\n\n08:49.920 --> 08:52.240\n the neurons are made first,\n\n08:52.240 --> 08:54.440\n and all of the supportive cells of the neurons,\n\n08:54.440 --> 08:56.840\n like the glia, is made later.\n\n08:56.840 --> 08:58.440\n And there is a reason for that\n\n08:58.440 --> 09:02.160\n because they have to assemble together in specific ways.\n\n09:02.160 --> 09:03.400\n But you also may say, well,\n\n09:03.400 --> 09:05.800\n why don't we just put them all together in the end?\n\n09:05.800 --> 09:09.000\n It's because as they develop next to each other,\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.360\n they influence their own development.\n\n09:11.360 --> 09:13.280\n So it's a different thing for a glia\n\n09:13.280 --> 09:15.480\n to be made alone in a dish,\n\n09:15.480 --> 09:19.440\n than a glia cell be made in a developing embryo\n\n09:19.440 --> 09:21.400\n with all these other cells around it\n\n09:21.400 --> 09:23.760\n that produce all these other signals.\n\n09:23.760 --> 09:25.960\n First of all, that's mind blowing,\n\n09:25.960 --> 09:27.880\n this development process.\n\n09:27.880 --> 09:29.800\n From my perspective in artificial intelligence,\n\n09:29.800 --> 09:33.480\n you often think of how incredible the final product is,\n\n09:33.480 --> 09:35.200\n the final product, the brain.\n\n09:35.200 --> 09:38.440\n But you're making me realize that the final product\n\n09:38.440 --> 09:42.080\n is just, the beautiful thing\n\n09:42.080 --> 09:44.480\n is the actual development process.\n\n09:44.480 --> 09:49.480\n Do we know the code that drives that development?\n\n09:51.160 --> 09:52.000\n Yeah.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.880\n Do we have any sense?\n\n09:53.880 --> 09:55.800\n First of all, thank you for saying\n\n09:55.800 --> 09:59.320\n that it's really the formation of the brain.\n\n09:59.320 --> 10:00.680\n It's really its development.\n\n10:00.680 --> 10:05.120\n It is this incredibly choreographed dance\n\n10:05.120 --> 10:07.480\n that happens the same way every time\n\n10:07.480 --> 10:10.560\n each one of us builds the brain, right?\n\n10:10.560 --> 10:12.680\n And that builds an organ that allows us\n\n10:12.680 --> 10:14.920\n to do what we're doing today, right?\n\n10:14.920 --> 10:16.360\n That is mind blowing.\n\n10:16.360 --> 10:18.920\n And this is why developmental neurobiologists\n\n10:18.920 --> 10:21.880\n never get tired of studying that.\n\n10:21.880 --> 10:23.800\n Now you're asking about the code.\n\n10:23.800 --> 10:24.880\n What drives this?\n\n10:24.880 --> 10:26.480\n How is this done?\n\n10:26.480 --> 10:29.720\n Well, it's millions of years of evolution\n\n10:29.720 --> 10:33.160\n of really fine tuning gene expression programs\n\n10:33.160 --> 10:37.440\n that allow certain cells to be made at a certain time\n\n10:37.440 --> 10:41.680\n and to become a certain cell type,\n\n10:41.680 --> 10:46.680\n but also mechanical forces of pressure bending.\n\n10:47.360 --> 10:50.320\n This embryo is not just, it will not stay a tube,\n\n10:50.320 --> 10:52.000\n this brain for very long.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.880\n At some point, this tube in the front of the embryo\n\n10:54.880 --> 10:58.160\n will expand to make the primordium of the brain, right?\n\n10:58.160 --> 11:02.840\n Now the forces that control that the cells feel,\n\n11:02.840 --> 11:04.960\n and this is another beautiful thing,\n\n11:04.960 --> 11:06.840\n the very force that they feel,\n\n11:06.840 --> 11:10.240\n which is different from a week before, a week ago,\n\n11:10.240 --> 11:12.280\n will tell the cell, oh, you're being squished\n\n11:12.280 --> 11:16.600\n in a certain way, begin to produce these new genes\n\n11:16.600 --> 11:18.440\n because now you are at the corner\n\n11:18.440 --> 11:21.480\n or you are in a stretch of cells\n\n11:21.480 --> 11:23.960\n or whatever it is, and that,\n\n11:23.960 --> 11:26.000\n so that mechanical physical force\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.480\n shapes the fate of the cell as well.\n\n11:29.480 --> 11:32.920\n So it's not only chemical, it's also mechanical.\n\n11:32.920 --> 11:34.440\n So from my perspective,\n\n11:34.440 --> 11:39.440\n biology is this incredibly complex mess, gooey mess.\n\n11:40.400 --> 11:43.880\n So you're saying mechanical forces.\n\n11:43.880 --> 11:47.760\n How different is like a computer\n\n11:47.760 --> 11:52.120\n or any kind of mechanical machine that we humans build\n\n11:52.120 --> 11:54.000\n and the biological systems?\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:54.840\n Have you been,\n\n11:54.840 --> 11:57.000\n because you've worked a lot with biological systems.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:00.680\n Are they as much of a mess as it seems\n\n12:00.680 --> 12:03.560\n from a perspective of an engineer, a mechanical engineer?\n\n12:03.560 --> 12:08.400\n Yeah, they are much more prone\n\n12:08.400 --> 12:11.680\n to taking alternative routes, right?\n\n12:11.680 --> 12:16.040\n So if you, we go back to printing a brain\n\n12:16.040 --> 12:18.200\n versus developing a brain,\n\n12:18.200 --> 12:20.480\n of course, if you print a brain,\n\n12:20.480 --> 12:23.040\n given that you start with the same building blocks,\n\n12:23.040 --> 12:23.960\n the same cells,\n\n12:23.960 --> 12:28.640\n you could potentially print it the same way every time,\n\n12:28.640 --> 12:32.520\n but that final brain may not work the same way\n\n12:32.520 --> 12:34.440\n as a brain built during development does\n\n12:34.440 --> 12:38.720\n because the very same building blocks that you're using\n\n12:38.720 --> 12:41.440\n developed in a completely different environment, right?\n\n12:41.440 --> 12:43.040\n It was not the environment of the brain.\n\n12:43.040 --> 12:46.680\n Therefore, they're gonna be different just by definition.\n\n12:46.680 --> 12:50.480\n So if you instead use development to build,\n\n12:50.480 --> 12:52.720\n let's say a brain organoid,\n\n12:52.720 --> 12:55.840\n which maybe we will be talking about in a few minutes.\n\n12:55.840 --> 12:56.960\n Those things are fascinating.\n\n12:56.960 --> 13:01.960\n Yes, so if you use processes of development,\n\n13:01.960 --> 13:03.360\n then when you watch it,\n\n13:03.360 --> 13:06.440\n you can see that sometimes things can go wrong\n\n13:06.440 --> 13:08.120\n in some organoids and by wrong,\n\n13:08.120 --> 13:10.840\n I mean different one organoid from the next.\n\n13:10.840 --> 13:14.800\n While if you think about that embryo, it always goes right.\n\n13:14.800 --> 13:18.920\n So this development, it's for as complex as it is.\n\n13:18.920 --> 13:23.600\n Every time a baby is born has, with very few exceptions,\n\n13:23.600 --> 13:26.160\n so the brain is like the next baby,\n\n13:26.160 --> 13:31.160\n but it's not the same if you develop it in a dish.\n\n13:31.320 --> 13:33.800\n And first of all, we don't even develop a brain,\n\n13:33.800 --> 13:36.040\n you develop something much simpler in the dish,\n\n13:36.040 --> 13:39.640\n but there are more options for building things differently,\n\n13:39.640 --> 13:42.920\n which really tells you that evolution\n\n13:42.920 --> 13:47.920\n has played a really tight game here\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:53.000\n for how in the end the brain is built in vivo.\n\n13:53.280 --> 13:55.360\n So just a quick, maybe dumb question,\n\n13:55.360 --> 13:58.320\n but it seems like this is not,\n\n13:58.320 --> 14:01.080\n the building process is not a dictatorship.\n\n14:01.080 --> 14:03.320\n It seems like there's not a centralized,\n\n14:04.760 --> 14:07.400\n like high level mechanism that says,\n\n14:07.400 --> 14:10.240\n okay, this cell built itself the wrong way,\n\n14:10.240 --> 14:11.480\n I'm gonna kill it.\n\n14:11.480 --> 14:15.440\n It seems like there's a really strong distributed mechanism.\n\n14:15.440 --> 14:18.400\n Is that in your sense for what you mean?\n\n14:18.400 --> 14:20.880\n There are a lot of possibilities, right?\n\n14:20.880 --> 14:23.560\n And if you think about, for example,\n\n14:23.560 --> 14:26.720\n different species building their brain,\n\n14:26.720 --> 14:28.840\n each brain is a little bit different.\n\n14:28.840 --> 14:31.000\n So the brain of a lizard is very different\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:35.480\n from that of a chicken, from that of one of us\n\n14:35.480 --> 14:38.000\n and so on and so forth and still is a brain,\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:43.000\n but it was built differently starting from stem cells\n\n14:43.240 --> 14:45.960\n that pretty much had the same potential,\n\n14:45.960 --> 14:49.320\n but in the end, evolution builds different brains\n\n14:49.320 --> 14:52.480\n in different species because that serves in a way\n\n14:52.480 --> 14:53.960\n the purpose of that species\n\n14:53.960 --> 14:56.560\n and the wellbeing of that organism.\n\n14:56.560 --> 15:00.640\n And so there are many possibilities,\n\n15:00.640 --> 15:04.760\n but then there is a way and you were talking about a code.\n\n15:04.760 --> 15:07.440\n Nobody knows what the entire code of development is.\n\n15:07.440 --> 15:08.600\n Of course we don't.\n\n15:08.600 --> 15:13.320\n We know bits and pieces of very specific aspects\n\n15:13.320 --> 15:14.440\n of development of the brain,\n\n15:14.440 --> 15:17.000\n what genes are involved to make a certain cell types,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.320\n how those two cells interact to make the next level structure\n\n15:20.320 --> 15:22.760\n that we might know, but the entirety of it,\n\n15:22.760 --> 15:26.120\n how it's so well controlled, it's really mind blowing.\n\n15:26.120 --> 15:29.760\n So in the first two months in the embryo or whatever,\n\n15:29.760 --> 15:32.680\n the first few weeks, months,\n\n15:32.680 --> 15:37.080\n so yeah, the building blocks are constructed.\n\n15:37.080 --> 15:40.000\n The actual, the different regions of the brain,\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.720\n I guess in the nervous system.\n\n15:42.720 --> 15:44.280\n Well, this continues way longer\n\n15:44.280 --> 15:46.440\n than just the first few months.\n\n15:46.440 --> 15:50.400\n So over the very first few months,\n\n15:50.400 --> 15:52.000\n you build a lot of the cells,\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:56.720\n but then there is continuous building of new cell types\n\n15:56.720 --> 15:58.360\n all the way through birth.\n\n15:58.360 --> 16:00.360\n And then even postnatally,\n\n16:00.360 --> 16:03.960\n I don't know if you've ever heard of myelin.\n\n16:03.960 --> 16:06.680\n Myelin is this sort of insulation\n\n16:06.680 --> 16:09.800\n that is built around the cables of the neurons\n\n16:09.800 --> 16:12.160\n so that the electricity can go really fast from.\n\n16:12.160 --> 16:13.400\n The axons, I guess they're called.\n\n16:13.400 --> 16:15.960\n The axons, they're called axons, exactly.\n\n16:15.960 --> 16:19.680\n And so as human beings,\n\n16:19.680 --> 16:24.320\n we myelinate our cells postnatally.\n\n16:24.320 --> 16:28.720\n A kid, a six year old kid has barely started\n\n16:28.720 --> 16:31.880\n the process of making the mature oligodendrocytes,\n\n16:31.880 --> 16:33.640\n which are the cells that then eventually\n\n16:33.640 --> 16:36.600\n will wrap the axons into myelin.\n\n16:36.600 --> 16:38.960\n And this will continue, believe it or not,\n\n16:38.960 --> 16:42.440\n until we are about 25, 30 years old.\n\n16:42.440 --> 16:45.320\n So there is a continuous process of maturation\n\n16:45.320 --> 16:47.080\n and tweaking and additions,\n\n16:47.080 --> 16:51.040\n and also in response to what we do.\n\n16:51.040 --> 16:53.960\n I remember taking AP Biology in high school,\n\n16:53.960 --> 16:57.040\n and in the textbook, it said that,\n\n16:57.040 --> 16:58.560\n I'm going by memory here,\n\n16:58.560 --> 17:01.080\n that scientists disagree on the purpose\n\n17:01.080 --> 17:04.720\n of myelin in the brain.\n\n17:04.720 --> 17:06.320\n Is that totally wrong?\n\n17:06.320 --> 17:10.600\n So like, I guess it speeds up the,\n\n17:12.240 --> 17:13.200\n okay, I might be wrong here,\n\n17:13.200 --> 17:14.760\n but I guess it speeds up the electricity\n\n17:14.760 --> 17:17.160\n traveling down the axon or something.\n\n17:17.160 --> 17:20.160\n Yeah, so that's the most sort of canonical,\n\n17:20.160 --> 17:21.720\n and definitely that's the case.\n\n17:21.720 --> 17:24.880\n So you have to imagine an axon,\n\n17:24.880 --> 17:27.680\n and you can think about it as a cable of some type\n\n17:27.680 --> 17:29.520\n with electricity going through.\n\n17:29.520 --> 17:34.400\n And what myelin does, by insulating the outside,\n\n17:34.400 --> 17:36.360\n I should say there are tracts of myelin\n\n17:36.360 --> 17:39.640\n and pieces of axons that are naked without myelin.\n\n17:39.640 --> 17:41.760\n And so by having the insulation,\n\n17:41.760 --> 17:43.320\n the electricity, instead of going straight\n\n17:43.320 --> 17:45.160\n through the cable, it will jump\n\n17:45.160 --> 17:47.240\n over a piece of myelin, right,\n\n17:47.240 --> 17:49.960\n to the next naked little piece and jump again.\n\n17:49.960 --> 17:52.720\n And therefore, that's the idea that you go faster.\n\n17:52.720 --> 17:57.400\n And it was always thought that in order to build\n\n17:57.400 --> 18:00.640\n a big brain, a big nervous system,\n\n18:00.640 --> 18:03.000\n in order to have a nervous system\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.320\n that can do very complex type of things,\n\n18:05.320 --> 18:06.640\n then you need a lot of myelin\n\n18:06.640 --> 18:09.680\n because you wanna go fast with this information\n\n18:09.680 --> 18:12.400\n from point A to point B.\n\n18:12.400 --> 18:16.840\n Well, a few years ago, maybe five years ago or so,\n\n18:16.840 --> 18:19.520\n we discovered that some of the most evolved,\n\n18:19.520 --> 18:23.120\n which means the newest type of neurons that we have\n\n18:23.120 --> 18:25.480\n as nonhuman primates, as human beings\n\n18:25.480 --> 18:28.040\n in the top of our cerebral cortex,\n\n18:28.040 --> 18:29.840\n which should be the neurons that do some\n\n18:29.840 --> 18:32.160\n of the most complex things that we do,\n\n18:32.160 --> 18:36.120\n well, those have axons that have very little myelin.\n\n18:36.120 --> 18:36.960\n Wow.\n\n18:36.960 --> 18:41.000\n And they have very interesting ways\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.360\n in which they put this myelin on their axons.\n\n18:43.360 --> 18:44.520\n You know, a little piece here,\n\n18:44.520 --> 18:47.640\n then a long track with no myelin, another chunk there.\n\n18:47.640 --> 18:49.840\n And some don't have myelin at all.\n\n18:49.840 --> 18:52.400\n So now, you have to explain\n\n18:52.400 --> 18:57.240\n where we're going with evolution.\n\n18:57.240 --> 18:58.760\n And if you think about it,\n\n18:58.760 --> 19:00.560\n perhaps as an electrical engineer,\n\n19:01.880 --> 19:05.240\n when I looked at it, I initially thought,\n\n19:05.240 --> 19:06.880\n and I'm a developmental neurobiologist,\n\n19:06.880 --> 19:10.160\n I thought maybe this is what we see now,\n\n19:10.160 --> 19:13.480\n but if we give evolution another few million years,\n\n19:13.480 --> 19:15.840\n we'll see a lot of myelin on these neurons too.\n\n19:15.840 --> 19:19.640\n But I actually think now that that's instead the future\n\n19:19.640 --> 19:20.480\n of the brain.\n\n19:20.480 --> 19:21.320\n Less myelin.\n\n19:21.320 --> 19:24.200\n Less myelin might allow for more flexibility\n\n19:24.200 --> 19:26.200\n on what you do with your axons,\n\n19:26.200 --> 19:28.000\n and therefore more complicated\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.640\n and unpredictable type of functions,\n\n19:31.640 --> 19:33.800\n which is also a bit mind blowing.\n\n19:33.800 --> 19:37.960\n So it seems like it's controlling the timing of the signal.\n\n19:37.960 --> 19:42.800\n So they're in the timing, you can encode a lot of information.\n\n19:42.800 --> 19:43.640\n Yeah.\n\n19:43.640 --> 19:44.480\n And so the brain.\n\n19:44.480 --> 19:48.520\n The timing, the chemistry of that little piece of axon,\n\n19:48.520 --> 19:52.080\n perhaps it's a dynamic process where the myelin can move.\n\n19:52.080 --> 19:57.080\n Now you see how many layers of variability you can add,\n\n19:57.440 --> 19:58.880\n and that's actually really good\n\n19:58.880 --> 20:02.240\n if you're trying to come up with a new function\n\n20:02.240 --> 20:06.520\n or a new capability or something unpredictable in a way.\n\n20:06.520 --> 20:08.160\n So we're gonna jump around a little bit,\n\n20:08.160 --> 20:12.800\n but the old question of how much is nature\n\n20:12.800 --> 20:14.480\n and how much is nurture?\n\n20:14.480 --> 20:17.240\n In terms of this incredible thing\n\n20:17.240 --> 20:18.920\n after the development is over,\n\n20:20.160 --> 20:25.160\n we seem to be kind of somewhat smart, intelligent,\n\n20:26.080 --> 20:27.520\n cognition, consciousness,\n\n20:27.520 --> 20:29.720\n all of these things are just incredible,\n\n20:29.720 --> 20:31.960\n ability to reason and so on emerge.\n\n20:31.960 --> 20:34.880\n In your sense, how much is in the hardware,\n\n20:34.880 --> 20:39.000\n in the nature and how much is in the nurture\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:40.960\n is learned through with our parents\n\n20:40.960 --> 20:42.440\n through interacting with the environment and so on.\n\n20:42.440 --> 20:43.760\n It's really both, right?\n\n20:43.760 --> 20:45.000\n If you think about it.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:48.000\n So we are born with a brain as babies\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:53.000\n that has most of its cells and most of its structures.\n\n20:53.600 --> 20:57.880\n And that will take a few years to grow,\n\n20:57.880 --> 21:00.600\n to add more, to be better.\n\n21:00.600 --> 21:04.120\n But really then we have this 20 years\n\n21:04.120 --> 21:07.000\n of interacting with the environment around us.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:10.760\n And so what that brain that was so perfectly built\n\n21:10.760 --> 21:15.760\n or imperfectly built due to our genetic cues\n\n21:16.400 --> 21:20.160\n will then be used to incorporate the environment\n\n21:20.160 --> 21:22.720\n in its further maturation and development.\n\n21:22.720 --> 21:26.960\n And so your experiences do shape your brain.\n\n21:26.960 --> 21:29.440\n I mean, we know that like if you and I\n\n21:29.440 --> 21:32.960\n may have had a different childhood or a different,\n\n21:32.960 --> 21:35.040\n we have been going to different schools,\n\n21:35.040 --> 21:36.440\n we have been learning different things\n\n21:36.440 --> 21:38.760\n and our brain is a little bit different because of that.\n\n21:38.760 --> 21:41.120\n We behave differently because of that.\n\n21:41.120 --> 21:44.000\n And so especially postnatally\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\n experience is extremely important.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.760\n We are born with a plastic brain.\n\n21:48.760 --> 21:51.440\n What that means is a brain that is able to change\n\n21:51.440 --> 21:56.320\n in response to stimuli that can be sensory.\n\n21:56.320 --> 22:01.000\n So perhaps some of the most illuminating studies\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.400\n that were done were studies in which\n\n22:03.400 --> 22:06.720\n the sensory organs were not working, right?\n\n22:06.720 --> 22:09.520\n Like if you are born with eyes that don't work,\n\n22:09.520 --> 22:12.520\n then your very brain, that piece of the brain\n\n22:12.520 --> 22:16.040\n that normally would process vision, the visual cortex,\n\n22:17.200 --> 22:19.800\n develops postnatally differently\n\n22:19.800 --> 22:23.480\n and it might be used to do something different, right?\n\n22:23.480 --> 22:25.600\n So that's the most extreme.\n\n22:25.600 --> 22:27.440\n The plasticity of the brain, I guess,\n\n22:27.440 --> 22:29.400\n is the magic hardware that it,\n\n22:29.400 --> 22:32.920\n and then it's flexibility in all forms\n\n22:32.920 --> 22:36.280\n is what enables the learning postnatally.\n\n22:36.280 --> 22:39.200\n Can you talk about organoids?\n\n22:39.200 --> 22:40.840\n What are they?\n\n22:40.840 --> 22:44.320\n And how can you use them to help us understand the brain\n\n22:44.320 --> 22:45.680\n and the development of the brain?\n\n22:45.680 --> 22:47.280\n This is very, very important.\n\n22:47.280 --> 22:49.880\n So the first thing I'd like to say,\n\n22:49.880 --> 22:51.360\n please skip this in the video.\n\n22:52.680 --> 22:56.040\n The first thing I'd like to say is that an organoid,\n\n22:56.040 --> 22:59.480\n a brain organoid is not the same as a brain.\n\n23:00.680 --> 23:01.600\n Okay?\n\n23:01.600 --> 23:03.600\n It's a fundamental distinction.\n\n23:03.600 --> 23:08.520\n It's a system, a cellular system\n\n23:08.520 --> 23:12.160\n that one can develop in the culture dish,\n\n23:12.160 --> 23:17.160\n starting from stem cells that will mimic some aspects\n\n23:17.160 --> 23:21.360\n of the development of the brain, but not all of it.\n\n23:21.360 --> 23:23.720\n They are very small, maximum,\n\n23:23.720 --> 23:27.880\n they become about four to five millimeters in diameters.\n\n23:27.880 --> 23:32.880\n They are much simpler than our brain, of course,\n\n23:32.880 --> 23:35.960\n but yet they are the only system\n\n23:35.960 --> 23:39.040\n where we can literally watch a process\n\n23:39.040 --> 23:42.040\n of human brain development unfold.\n\n23:42.040 --> 23:44.600\n And by watch, I mean, study it.\n\n23:44.600 --> 23:47.520\n Remember when I told you that we can't understand\n\n23:47.520 --> 23:49.520\n everything about development in our own brain\n\n23:49.520 --> 23:51.000\n by studying a mouse?\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.080\n Well, we can't study the actual process\n\n23:53.080 --> 23:54.280\n of development of the human brain\n\n23:54.280 --> 23:55.760\n because it all happens in utero.\n\n23:55.760 --> 23:58.800\n So we will never have access to that process ever.\n\n23:58.800 --> 24:02.960\n And therefore, this is our next best thing.\n\n24:02.960 --> 24:06.960\n Like a bunch of stem cells that can be coaxed\n\n24:06.960 --> 24:10.240\n into starting a process of neural tube formation.\n\n24:10.240 --> 24:13.200\n Remember that tube that is made by the embryo early on.\n\n24:13.200 --> 24:15.640\n And from there, a lot of the cell types\n\n24:15.640 --> 24:19.200\n that are present within the brain,\n\n24:19.200 --> 24:23.480\n and you can simply watch it and study,\n\n24:23.480 --> 24:27.200\n but you can also think about diseases\n\n24:27.200 --> 24:29.800\n where development of the brain\n\n24:29.800 --> 24:33.240\n does not proceed normally, right, properly.\n\n24:33.240 --> 24:34.880\n Think about neurodevelopmental diseases.\n\n24:34.880 --> 24:37.320\n There are many, many different types.\n\n24:37.320 --> 24:39.160\n Think about autism spectrum disorders.\n\n24:39.160 --> 24:41.680\n There are also many different types of autism.\n\n24:41.680 --> 24:44.360\n So there you could take a stem cell,\n\n24:44.360 --> 24:46.600\n which really means either a sample of blood\n\n24:46.600 --> 24:50.080\n or a sample of skin from the patient,\n\n24:50.080 --> 24:53.520\n make a stem cell, and then with that stem cell,\n\n24:53.520 --> 24:56.200\n watch a process of formation of a brain organ\n\n24:56.200 --> 25:00.600\n or a brain organoid of that person with that genetics,\n\n25:00.600 --> 25:02.200\n with that genetic code in it.\n\n25:02.200 --> 25:05.800\n And you can ask, what is this genetic code doing\n\n25:05.800 --> 25:08.760\n to some aspects of development of the brain?\n\n25:08.760 --> 25:12.000\n And for the first time, you may come to solutions\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:16.000\n like what cells are involved in autism, right?\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.360\n So many questions around this.\n\n25:17.360 --> 25:20.520\n So if you take this human stem cell\n\n25:20.520 --> 25:23.360\n for that particular person with that genetic code,\n\n25:23.360 --> 25:26.520\n how, and you try to build an organoid,\n\n25:26.520 --> 25:28.840\n how often will it look similar?\n\n25:28.840 --> 25:31.800\n What's the, yeah, so.\n\n25:31.800 --> 25:33.240\n The reproducibility?\n\n25:33.240 --> 25:36.600\n Yes, or how much variability is the flip side of that?\n\n25:36.600 --> 25:40.280\n Yeah, so there is much more variability\n\n25:40.280 --> 25:44.520\n in building organoids than there is in building brain.\n\n25:44.520 --> 25:47.280\n It's really true that the majority of us,\n\n25:47.280 --> 25:49.560\n when we are born as babies,\n\n25:49.560 --> 25:52.440\n our brains look a lot like each other.\n\n25:52.440 --> 25:54.880\n This is the magic that the embryo does,\n\n25:54.880 --> 25:57.640\n where it builds a brain in the context of a body\n\n25:57.640 --> 26:01.240\n and there is very little variability there.\n\n26:01.240 --> 26:02.280\n There is disease, of course,\n\n26:02.280 --> 26:03.960\n but in general, a little variability.\n\n26:03.960 --> 26:05.760\n When you build an organoid,\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.480\n we don't have the full code for how this is done.\n\n26:09.480 --> 26:13.400\n And so in part, the organoid somewhat builds itself\n\n26:13.400 --> 26:15.560\n because there are some structures of the brain\n\n26:15.560 --> 26:17.240\n that the cells know how to make.\n\n26:18.120 --> 26:21.800\n And another part comes from the investigator,\n\n26:21.800 --> 26:26.120\n the scientist adding to the media factors\n\n26:26.120 --> 26:27.960\n that we know in the mouse, for example,\n\n26:27.960 --> 26:30.680\n would foster a certain step of development,\n\n26:30.680 --> 26:33.160\n but it's very limited.\n\n26:33.160 --> 26:36.080\n And so as a result,\n\n26:36.080 --> 26:38.120\n the kind of product you get in the end\n\n26:38.120 --> 26:39.640\n is much more reductionist,\n\n26:39.640 --> 26:42.600\n is much more simple than what you get in vivo.\n\n26:42.600 --> 26:46.120\n It mimics early events of development as of today,\n\n26:46.120 --> 26:49.040\n and it doesn't build very complex type of anatomy\n\n26:49.040 --> 26:52.480\n and structure does not as of today,\n\n26:52.480 --> 26:54.840\n which happens instead in vivo.\n\n26:54.840 --> 26:59.040\n And also the variability that you see,\n\n26:59.040 --> 27:02.720\n one organ to the next tends to be higher\n\n27:02.720 --> 27:05.480\n than when you compare an embryo to the next.\n\n27:05.480 --> 27:07.320\n So, okay, then the next question is,\n\n27:07.320 --> 27:11.040\n how hard and maybe another flip side of that expensive\n\n27:11.040 --> 27:14.880\n is it to go from one stem cell to an organoid?\n\n27:14.880 --> 27:16.680\n How many can you build in like,\n\n27:16.680 --> 27:18.400\n because it sounds very complicated.\n\n27:18.400 --> 27:23.400\n It's work definitely, and it's money definitely,\n\n27:23.400 --> 27:28.000\n but you can really grow a very high number\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.560\n of these organoids, can go perhaps,\n\n27:31.560 --> 27:32.680\n I told you the maximum,\n\n27:32.680 --> 27:35.320\n they become about five millimeters in diameter.\n\n27:35.320 --> 27:39.920\n So this is about the size of a tiny, tiny raisin,\n\n27:40.920 --> 27:43.120\n or perhaps the seed of an apple.\n\n27:43.120 --> 27:47.480\n And so you can grow 50 to 100 of those\n\n27:47.480 --> 27:51.240\n inside one big bioreactors, which are these flasks\n\n27:51.240 --> 27:55.440\n where the media provides nutrients for the organoids.\n\n27:55.440 --> 28:00.440\n So the problem is not to grow more or less of them.\n\n28:01.680 --> 28:06.440\n It's really to figure out how to grow them in a way\n\n28:06.440 --> 28:08.360\n that they are more and more reproducible,\n\n28:08.360 --> 28:09.920\n for example, organoid to organoid,\n\n28:09.920 --> 28:13.160\n so they can be used to study a biological process.\n\n28:13.160 --> 28:15.560\n Because if you have too much variability,\n\n28:15.560 --> 28:17.080\n then you never know if what you see\n\n28:17.080 --> 28:19.520\n is just an exception or really the rule.\n\n28:19.520 --> 28:22.200\n So what does an organoid look like?\n\n28:22.200 --> 28:25.080\n Are there different neurons already emerging?\n\n28:25.080 --> 28:28.520\n Is there, well, first, can you tell me\n\n28:28.520 --> 28:29.920\n what kind of neurons are there?\n\n28:29.920 --> 28:30.880\n Yes.\n\n28:30.880 --> 28:35.560\n Are they sort of all the same?\n\n28:35.560 --> 28:37.160\n Are they not all the same?\n\n28:38.200 --> 28:39.520\n How much do we understand?\n\n28:39.520 --> 28:43.440\n And how much of that variance, if any,\n\n28:43.440 --> 28:45.800\n can exist in organoids?\n\n28:45.800 --> 28:47.000\n Yes.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.400\n So you could grow,\n\n28:49.400 --> 28:52.440\n I told you that the brain has different parts.\n\n28:52.440 --> 28:55.960\n So the cerebral cortex is on the top part of the brain,\n\n28:55.960 --> 28:57.960\n but there is another region called the striatum\n\n28:57.960 --> 28:59.960\n that is below the cortex and so on and so forth.\n\n28:59.960 --> 29:03.760\n All of these regions have different types of cells\n\n29:03.760 --> 29:05.640\n in the actual brain, okay?\n\n29:05.640 --> 29:08.880\n And so scientists have been able to grow organoids\n\n29:08.880 --> 29:11.440\n that may mimic some aspects of development\n\n29:11.440 --> 29:13.960\n of these different regions of the brain.\n\n29:13.960 --> 29:16.440\n And so we are very interested in the cerebral cortex.\n\n29:16.440 --> 29:17.760\n That's the coolest part, right?\n\n29:17.760 --> 29:18.600\n Very cool.\n\n29:18.600 --> 29:20.880\n I agree with you.\n\n29:20.880 --> 29:22.040\n We wouldn't be here talking\n\n29:22.040 --> 29:23.880\n if we didn't have a cerebral cortex.\n\n29:23.880 --> 29:26.040\n It's also, I like to think, the part of the brain\n\n29:26.040 --> 29:27.600\n that really truly makes us human,\n\n29:27.600 --> 29:30.200\n the most evolved in recent evolution.\n\n29:30.200 --> 29:33.600\n And so in the attempt to make the cerebral cortex\n\n29:33.600 --> 29:37.200\n and by figuring out a way to have these organoids\n\n29:37.200 --> 29:40.240\n continue to grow and develop for extended periods of times,\n\n29:40.240 --> 29:42.440\n much like it happens in the real embryo,\n\n29:42.440 --> 29:44.240\n months and months in culture,\n\n29:44.240 --> 29:48.560\n then you can see that many different types of neurons\n\n29:48.560 --> 29:50.120\n of the cortex appear.\n\n29:50.120 --> 29:52.120\n And at some point, also the astrocytes,\n\n29:52.120 --> 29:57.120\n so the glia cells of the cerebral cortex also appear.\n\n29:57.600 --> 30:00.320\n What are these astrocytes?\n\n30:00.320 --> 30:03.360\n The astrocytes are not neurons, so they're not nerve cells,\n\n30:03.360 --> 30:06.120\n but they play very important roles.\n\n30:06.120 --> 30:08.960\n One important role is to support the neuron.\n\n30:08.960 --> 30:11.800\n But of course, they have much more active type of roles.\n\n30:11.800 --> 30:14.480\n They're very important, for example, to make the synapses,\n\n30:14.480 --> 30:17.560\n which are the point of contact and communication\n\n30:17.560 --> 30:18.800\n between two neurons.\n\n30:21.400 --> 30:25.600\n So all that chemistry fun happens in the synapses,\n\n30:25.600 --> 30:28.120\n happens because of these cells?\n\n30:28.120 --> 30:29.560\n Are they the medium in which?\n\n30:29.560 --> 30:31.960\n It happens because of the interactions,\n\n30:31.960 --> 30:34.720\n happens because you are making the cells\n\n30:34.720 --> 30:36.280\n and they have certain properties,\n\n30:36.280 --> 30:40.320\n including the ability to make neurotransmitters,\n\n30:40.320 --> 30:43.240\n which are the chemicals that are secreted to the synapses,\n\n30:43.240 --> 30:46.440\n including the ability of making these axons grow\n\n30:46.440 --> 30:49.120\n with their growth cones and so on and so forth.\n\n30:49.120 --> 30:51.320\n And then you have other cells around it\n\n30:51.320 --> 30:55.160\n that release chemicals or touch the neurons\n\n30:55.160 --> 30:57.120\n or interact with them in different ways\n\n30:57.120 --> 30:59.800\n to really foster this perfect process,\n\n30:59.800 --> 31:02.440\n in this case of synaptogenesis.\n\n31:02.440 --> 31:05.640\n And this does happen within organoids.\n\n31:05.640 --> 31:09.720\n So the mechanical and the chemical stuff happens.\n\n31:09.720 --> 31:11.600\n The connectivity between neurons,\n\n31:11.600 --> 31:13.320\n this in a way is not surprising\n\n31:13.320 --> 31:18.120\n because scientists have been culturing neurons forever.\n\n31:18.120 --> 31:20.760\n And when you take a neuron, even a very young one,\n\n31:20.760 --> 31:23.480\n and you culture it, eventually finds another cell\n\n31:23.480 --> 31:26.920\n or another neuron to talk to, it will form a synapse.\n\n31:26.920 --> 31:28.520\n Are we talking about mice neurons?\n\n31:28.520 --> 31:29.640\n Are we talking about human neurons?\n\n31:29.640 --> 31:30.600\n It doesn't matter, both.\n\n31:30.600 --> 31:33.240\n So you can culture a neuron, like a single neuron\n\n31:33.240 --> 31:37.920\n and give it a little friend and it starts interacting?\n\n31:37.920 --> 31:41.000\n Yes, so neurons are able to, it sounds,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.520\n it's more simple than what it may sound to you.\n\n31:44.600 --> 31:48.320\n Neurons have molecular properties and structural properties\n\n31:48.320 --> 31:50.920\n that allow them to really communicate with other cells.\n\n31:50.920 --> 31:53.200\n And so if you put not one neuron,\n\n31:53.200 --> 31:55.160\n but if you put several neurons together,\n\n31:55.160 --> 31:59.400\n chances are that they will form synapses with each other.\n\n32:00.280 --> 32:01.120\n Okay, great.\n\n32:01.120 --> 32:03.360\n So an organoid is not a brain.\n\n32:03.360 --> 32:04.200\n No.\n\n32:04.200 --> 32:09.200\n But there's some, it's able to,\n\n32:09.240 --> 32:10.440\n especially what you're talking about,\n\n32:10.440 --> 32:15.120\n mimics some properties of the cerebral cortex, for example.\n\n32:15.120 --> 32:17.960\n So what can you understand about the brain\n\n32:17.960 --> 32:21.080\n by studying an organoid of a cerebral cortex?\n\n32:21.080 --> 32:25.800\n I can literally study all this incredible diversity\n\n32:25.800 --> 32:28.040\n of cell type, all these many, many different classes\n\n32:28.040 --> 32:30.760\n of cells, how are they made?\n\n32:30.760 --> 32:32.520\n How do they look like?\n\n32:32.520 --> 32:34.960\n What do they need to be made properly?\n\n32:34.960 --> 32:39.720\n And what goes wrong if now the genetics of that stem cell\n\n32:39.720 --> 32:42.800\n that I used to make the organoid came from a patient\n\n32:42.800 --> 32:44.320\n with a neurodevelopmental disease?\n\n32:44.320 --> 32:47.640\n Can I actually watch for the very first time\n\n32:47.640 --> 32:51.400\n what may have gone wrong years before in this kid\n\n32:51.400 --> 32:53.520\n when its own brain was being made?\n\n32:53.520 --> 32:54.760\n Think about that loop.\n\n32:54.760 --> 32:59.600\n In a way, it's a little tiny rudimentary window\n\n32:59.600 --> 33:04.280\n into the past, into the time when that brain\n\n33:04.280 --> 33:07.680\n in a kid that had this neurodevelopmental disease\n\n33:07.680 --> 33:08.880\n was being made.\n\n33:10.120 --> 33:12.880\n And I think that's unbelievably powerful\n\n33:12.880 --> 33:16.800\n because today we have no idea of what cell types,\n\n33:16.800 --> 33:18.760\n we barely know what brain regions\n\n33:18.760 --> 33:20.880\n are affected in these diseases.\n\n33:20.880 --> 33:23.720\n Now we have an experimental system\n\n33:23.720 --> 33:25.440\n that we can study in the lab.\n\n33:25.440 --> 33:28.440\n And we can ask, what are the cells affected?\n\n33:28.440 --> 33:31.840\n When during development things went wrong?\n\n33:31.840 --> 33:34.080\n What are the molecules among the many, many\n\n33:34.080 --> 33:36.600\n different molecules that control brain development?\n\n33:36.600 --> 33:39.720\n Which ones are the ones that really messed up here\n\n33:39.720 --> 33:42.160\n and we want perhaps to fix?\n\n33:42.160 --> 33:44.520\n And what is really the final product?\n\n33:44.520 --> 33:48.560\n Is it a less strong kind of circuit and brain?\n\n33:48.560 --> 33:51.000\n Is it a brain that lacks a cell type?\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.040\n What is it?\n\n33:52.040 --> 33:54.920\n Because then we can think about treatment\n\n33:54.920 --> 33:59.360\n and care for these patients that is informed\n\n33:59.360 --> 34:02.080\n rather than just based on current diagnostics.\n\n34:02.080 --> 34:04.560\n So how hard is it to detect\n\n34:04.560 --> 34:06.360\n through the developmental process?\n\n34:06.360 --> 34:09.440\n It's a super exciting tool\n\n34:10.520 --> 34:14.000\n to see how different conditions develop.\n\n34:15.200 --> 34:17.640\n How hard is it to detect that, wait a minute,\n\n34:17.640 --> 34:20.800\n this is abnormal development.\n\n34:20.800 --> 34:21.640\n Yeah.\n\n34:21.640 --> 34:24.760\n How much signal is there?\n\n34:24.760 --> 34:26.480\n How much of it is it a mess?\n\n34:26.480 --> 34:29.440\n Because things can go wrong at multiple levels, right?\n\n34:29.440 --> 34:34.280\n You could have a cell that is born and built\n\n34:34.280 --> 34:36.200\n but then doesn't work properly\n\n34:36.200 --> 34:38.280\n or a cell that is not even born\n\n34:38.280 --> 34:40.680\n or a cell that doesn't interact with other cells differently\n\n34:40.680 --> 34:42.080\n and so on and so forth.\n\n34:42.080 --> 34:44.360\n So today we have technology\n\n34:44.360 --> 34:47.720\n that we did not have even five years ago\n\n34:47.720 --> 34:49.760\n that allows us to look for example\n\n34:49.760 --> 34:52.080\n at the molecular picture of a cell,\n\n34:52.080 --> 34:56.560\n of a single cell in a sea of cells with high precision.\n\n34:56.560 --> 34:58.800\n And so that molecular information\n\n34:58.800 --> 35:01.720\n where you compare many, many single cells\n\n35:01.720 --> 35:03.600\n for the genes that they produce\n\n35:03.600 --> 35:06.120\n between a control individual\n\n35:06.120 --> 35:10.080\n and an individual with a neurodevelopmental disease,\n\n35:10.080 --> 35:13.760\n that may tell you what is different molecularly.\n\n35:13.760 --> 35:18.520\n Or you could see that some cells are not even made,\n\n35:18.520 --> 35:20.720\n for example, or that the process of maturation\n\n35:20.720 --> 35:22.560\n of the cells may be wrong.\n\n35:22.560 --> 35:24.960\n There are many different levels here\n\n35:25.920 --> 35:29.520\n and we can study the cells at the molecular level\n\n35:29.520 --> 35:33.320\n but also we can use the organoids to ask questions\n\n35:33.320 --> 35:35.240\n about the properties of the neurons,\n\n35:35.240 --> 35:37.280\n the functional properties,\n\n35:37.280 --> 35:38.880\n how they communicate with each other,\n\n35:38.880 --> 35:41.320\n how they respond to a stimulus and so on and so forth.\n\n35:41.320 --> 35:46.320\n And we may get an abnormalities there, right?\n\n35:46.320 --> 35:47.440\n Detect those.\n\n35:47.440 --> 35:50.560\n So how early is this work in the,\n\n35:51.760 --> 35:54.240\n maybe in the history of science?\n\n35:54.240 --> 35:59.240\n So, I mean like, so if you were to,\n\n35:59.720 --> 36:04.720\n if you and I time travel a thousand years into the future,\n\n36:05.160 --> 36:09.880\n organoids seem to be, maybe I'm romanticizing the notion\n\n36:09.880 --> 36:12.720\n but you're building not a brain\n\n36:12.720 --> 36:15.640\n but something that has properties of a brain.\n\n36:15.640 --> 36:18.960\n So it feels like you might be getting close to,\n\n36:18.960 --> 36:23.160\n in the building process, to build this to understand.\n\n36:23.160 --> 36:28.160\n So how far are we in this understanding\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.200\n process of development?\n\n36:31.320 --> 36:34.160\n A thousand years from now, it's a long time from now.\n\n36:34.160 --> 36:36.360\n So if this planet is still gonna be here\n\n36:36.360 --> 36:38.160\n a thousand years from now.\n\n36:38.160 --> 36:41.960\n So, I mean, if, you know, like they write a book,\n\n36:41.960 --> 36:43.960\n obviously there'll be a chapter about you.\n\n36:43.960 --> 36:47.320\n That's right, that science fiction book, today.\n\n36:47.320 --> 36:49.920\n Yeah, today, about, I mean, I guess where\n\n36:49.920 --> 36:52.040\n we really understood very little about the brain\n\n36:52.040 --> 36:55.880\n a century ago, I was a big fan in high school\n\n36:55.880 --> 36:58.760\n of reading Freud and so on, still am of psychiatry.\n\n36:59.680 --> 37:01.480\n I would say we still understand very little\n\n37:01.480 --> 37:03.680\n about the functional aspect of just,\n\n37:04.680 --> 37:07.760\n but how in the history of understanding\n\n37:07.760 --> 37:09.640\n the biology of the brain, the development,\n\n37:09.640 --> 37:11.240\n how far are we along?\n\n37:11.240 --> 37:12.960\n It's a very good question.\n\n37:12.960 --> 37:15.520\n And so this is just, of course, my opinion.\n\n37:15.520 --> 37:19.720\n I think that we did not have technology\n\n37:19.720 --> 37:23.160\n even 10 years ago or certainly not 20 years ago\n\n37:23.160 --> 37:27.760\n to even think about experimentally investigating\n\n37:27.760 --> 37:30.160\n the development of the human brain.\n\n37:30.160 --> 37:32.200\n So we've done a lot of work in science\n\n37:32.200 --> 37:35.480\n to study the brain or many other organisms.\n\n37:35.480 --> 37:39.600\n Now we have some technologies which I'll spell out\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:43.120\n that allow us to actually look at the real thing\n\n37:43.120 --> 37:45.040\n and look at the brain, at the human brain.\n\n37:45.040 --> 37:46.840\n So what are these technologies?\n\n37:46.840 --> 37:50.440\n There has been huge progress in stem cell biology.\n\n37:50.440 --> 37:54.080\n The moment someone figured out how to turn a skin cell\n\n37:54.080 --> 37:57.760\n into an embryonic stem cell, basically,\n\n37:57.760 --> 38:00.160\n and that how that embryonic stem cell\n\n38:00.160 --> 38:02.480\n could begin a process of development again\n\n38:02.480 --> 38:04.000\n to, for example, make a brain,\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.040\n there was a huge advance,\n\n38:06.040 --> 38:08.160\n and in fact, there was a Nobel Prize for that.\n\n38:08.160 --> 38:10.400\n That started the field, really,\n\n38:10.400 --> 38:14.200\n of using stem cells to build organs.\n\n38:14.200 --> 38:17.000\n Now we can build on all the knowledge of development\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:18.520\n that we build over the many, many, many years\n\n38:18.520 --> 38:20.680\n to say, how do we make the stem cells\n\n38:20.680 --> 38:22.640\n now make more and more complex aspects\n\n38:22.640 --> 38:24.360\n of development of the human brain?\n\n38:25.240 --> 38:28.440\n So this field is young, the field of brain organoids,\n\n38:28.440 --> 38:30.080\n but it's moving faster.\n\n38:30.080 --> 38:32.520\n And it's moving fast in a very serious way\n\n38:32.520 --> 38:35.920\n that is rooted in labs with the right ethical framework\n\n38:35.920 --> 38:40.680\n and really building on solid science\n\n38:40.680 --> 38:43.040\n for what reality is and what is not.\n\n38:44.680 --> 38:49.080\n But it will go faster and it will be more and more powerful.\n\n38:49.080 --> 38:51.440\n We also have technology that allows us\n\n38:51.440 --> 38:54.600\n to basically study the properties of single cells\n\n38:54.600 --> 38:59.200\n across many, many millions of single cells,\n\n38:59.200 --> 39:02.120\n which we didn't have perhaps five years ago.\n\n39:02.120 --> 39:04.800\n So now with that, even an organoid\n\n39:04.800 --> 39:08.440\n that has millions of cells can be profiled in a way,\n\n39:08.440 --> 39:11.280\n looked at with very, very high resolution,\n\n39:11.280 --> 39:13.920\n the single cell level to really understand\n\n39:13.920 --> 39:14.880\n what is going on.\n\n39:14.880 --> 39:17.480\n And you could do it in multiple stages of development\n\n39:17.480 --> 39:20.080\n and you can build your hypothesis and so on and so forth.\n\n39:20.080 --> 39:22.560\n So it's not gonna be a thousand years.\n\n39:22.560 --> 39:25.200\n It's gonna be a shorter amount of time.\n\n39:25.200 --> 39:29.440\n And I see this as sort of an exponential growth\n\n39:29.440 --> 39:33.520\n of this field enabled by these technologies\n\n39:33.520 --> 39:34.960\n that we didn't have before.\n\n39:34.960 --> 39:36.920\n And so we're gonna see something transformative\n\n39:36.920 --> 39:41.840\n that we didn't see at all in the prior thousand years.\n\n39:41.840 --> 39:44.600\n So I apologize for the crazy sci fi questions,\n\n39:44.600 --> 39:48.120\n but the developmental process is fascinating\n\n39:48.120 --> 39:53.120\n to watch and study, but how far are we away from\n\n39:53.320 --> 39:57.240\n and maybe how difficult is it to build\n\n39:57.240 --> 40:02.240\n not just an organoid, but a human brain from a stem cell?\n\n40:02.240 --> 40:05.640\n Yeah, first of all, that's not the goal\n\n40:05.640 --> 40:07.680\n for the majority of the serious scientists\n\n40:07.680 --> 40:12.640\n that work on this because you don't have to build\n\n40:12.640 --> 40:16.040\n the whole human brain to make this model useful\n\n40:16.040 --> 40:17.920\n for understanding how the brain develops\n\n40:17.920 --> 40:20.400\n or understanding disease.\n\n40:20.400 --> 40:22.400\n You don't have to build the whole thing.\n\n40:22.400 --> 40:25.160\n So let me just comment on this, fascinating.\n\n40:25.160 --> 40:29.160\n It shows to me the difference between you and I\n\n40:29.160 --> 40:31.800\n as you're actually trying to understand\n\n40:31.800 --> 40:34.200\n the beauty of the human brain and to use it\n\n40:34.200 --> 40:36.880\n to really help thousands or millions of people\n\n40:36.880 --> 40:38.800\n with disease and so on, right?\n\n40:38.800 --> 40:41.480\n From an artificial intelligence perspective,\n\n40:41.480 --> 40:45.600\n we're trying to build systems that we can put in robots\n\n40:45.600 --> 40:49.080\n and try to create systems that have echoes\n\n40:49.080 --> 40:52.360\n of the intelligence about reasoning about the world,\n\n40:52.360 --> 40:53.600\n navigating the world.\n\n40:53.600 --> 40:56.000\n It's different objectives, I think.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:57.560\n Yeah, that's very much science fiction.\n\n40:57.560 --> 41:00.480\n Science fiction, but we operate in science fiction a little bit.\n\n41:00.480 --> 41:03.400\n So on that point of building a brain,\n\n41:03.400 --> 41:06.160\n even though that is not the focus or interest, perhaps,\n\n41:06.160 --> 41:08.480\n of the community, how difficult is it?\n\n41:08.480 --> 41:11.160\n Is it truly science fiction at this point?\n\n41:11.160 --> 41:13.920\n I think the field will progress, like I said,\n\n41:13.920 --> 41:17.240\n and that the system will be more and more complex\n\n41:17.240 --> 41:18.680\n in a way, right?\n\n41:18.680 --> 41:23.680\n But there are properties that emerge from the human brain\n\n41:23.840 --> 41:25.360\n that have to do with the mind,\n\n41:25.360 --> 41:26.720\n that may have to do with consciousness,\n\n41:26.720 --> 41:29.800\n that may have to do with intelligence or whatever\n\n41:29.800 --> 41:31.960\n that we really don't understand\n\n41:31.960 --> 41:35.560\n even how they can emerge from an actual, real brain.\n\n41:35.560 --> 41:39.120\n And therefore, we can now measure or study in an organoid.\n\n41:39.120 --> 41:43.000\n So I think that this field, many, many years from now,\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:46.960\n may lead to the building of better neural circuits\n\n41:48.280 --> 41:50.320\n that really are built out of understanding\n\n41:50.320 --> 41:52.240\n of how this process really works.\n\n41:52.240 --> 41:57.000\n And it's hard to predict how complex this really will be.\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:00.200\n I really don't think we're so far from,\n\n42:00.200 --> 42:01.200\n it makes me laugh, really.\n\n42:01.200 --> 42:05.120\n It's really that far from building the human brain.\n\n42:05.120 --> 42:07.800\n But you're gonna be building something\n\n42:07.800 --> 42:11.600\n that is always a bad version of it,\n\n42:11.600 --> 42:14.840\n but that may have really powerful properties\n\n42:14.840 --> 42:18.560\n and might be able to respond to stimuli\n\n42:18.560 --> 42:21.720\n or be used in certain context.\n\n42:21.720 --> 42:23.680\n And this is why I really think\n\n42:23.680 --> 42:25.800\n that there is no other way to do this science,\n\n42:25.800 --> 42:28.200\n but within the right ethical framework,\n\n42:28.200 --> 42:30.600\n because where you're going with this is also,\n\n42:31.520 --> 42:34.080\n we can talk about science fiction and write that book,\n\n42:34.080 --> 42:36.600\n and we could today,\n\n42:36.600 --> 42:41.520\n but this work happens in a specific ethical framework\n\n42:41.520 --> 42:43.200\n that we don't decide just as scientists,\n\n42:43.200 --> 42:44.880\n but also as a society.\n\n42:44.880 --> 42:48.560\n So the ethical framework here is a fascinating one,\n\n42:48.560 --> 42:49.720\n is a complicated one.\n\n42:49.720 --> 42:51.120\n Yes.\n\n42:51.120 --> 42:53.320\n Do you have a sense, a grasp\n\n42:53.320 --> 42:58.320\n of how we think about ethically of building organoids\n\n43:00.040 --> 43:04.160\n from human stem cells to understand the brain?\n\n43:04.160 --> 43:06.280\n It seems like a tool\n\n43:06.280 --> 43:11.080\n for helping potentially millions of people cure diseases\n\n43:11.080 --> 43:14.960\n or at least start the cure by understanding it.\n\n43:14.960 --> 43:17.840\n But is there more, is there gray areas\n\n43:17.840 --> 43:22.400\n that we have to think about ethically?\n\n43:22.400 --> 43:23.240\n Absolutely.\n\n43:23.240 --> 43:25.600\n We must think about that.\n\n43:25.600 --> 43:29.640\n Every discussion about the ethics of this\n\n43:29.640 --> 43:32.720\n needs to be based on actual data\n\n43:32.720 --> 43:34.520\n from the models that we have today\n\n43:34.520 --> 43:36.360\n and from the ones that we will have tomorrow.\n\n43:36.360 --> 43:37.880\n So it's a continuous conversation.\n\n43:37.880 --> 43:39.880\n It's not something that you decide now.\n\n43:39.880 --> 43:42.080\n Today, there is no issue really.\n\n43:42.080 --> 43:47.080\n Very simple models that clearly can help you in many ways\n\n43:47.320 --> 43:49.920\n without much think about,\n\n43:49.920 --> 43:52.240\n but tomorrow we need to have another conversation\n\n43:52.240 --> 43:53.080\n and so on and so forth.\n\n43:53.080 --> 43:54.680\n And so the way we do this\n\n43:54.680 --> 43:57.920\n is to actually really bring together constantly\n\n43:57.920 --> 44:00.440\n a group of people that are not only scientists,\n\n44:00.440 --> 44:03.400\n but also bioethicists, the lawyers, philosophers,\n\n44:03.400 --> 44:04.880\n psychiatrists and so on,\n\n44:04.880 --> 44:06.720\n psychologists and so on and so forth\n\n44:06.720 --> 44:11.720\n to decide as a society really what we should\n\n44:13.040 --> 44:15.320\n and what we should not do.\n\n44:15.320 --> 44:17.600\n So that's the way to think about the ethics.\n\n44:17.600 --> 44:21.240\n Now, I also think though, that as a scientist,\n\n44:21.240 --> 44:23.720\n I have a moral responsibility.\n\n44:23.720 --> 44:28.720\n So if you think about how transformative it could be\n\n44:29.480 --> 44:34.120\n for understanding and curing a neuropsychiatric disease,\n\n44:34.120 --> 44:37.320\n to be able to actually watch and study\n\n44:37.320 --> 44:40.640\n and treat with drugs the very brain\n\n44:40.640 --> 44:43.240\n of the patient that you are trying to study.\n\n44:43.240 --> 44:47.200\n How transformative at this moment in time this could be.\n\n44:47.200 --> 44:48.760\n We couldn't do it five years ago,\n\n44:48.760 --> 44:50.720\n we could do it now, right?\n\n44:50.720 --> 44:51.560\n If we didn't do it.\n\n44:51.560 --> 44:52.960\n Taking a stem cell of a particular patient.\n\n44:52.960 --> 44:56.120\n Patient and make an organoid for a simple\n\n44:56.120 --> 44:58.880\n and different from the human brain,\n\n44:58.880 --> 45:02.160\n it still is his process of brain development\n\n45:02.160 --> 45:04.720\n with his or her genetics.\n\n45:04.720 --> 45:08.320\n And we could understand perhaps what is going wrong.\n\n45:08.320 --> 45:09.960\n Perhaps we could use as a platform,\n\n45:09.960 --> 45:12.160\n as a cellular platform to screen for drugs,\n\n45:12.160 --> 45:15.280\n to fix a process and so on and so forth, right?\n\n45:15.280 --> 45:18.840\n So we could do it now, we couldn't do it five years ago.\n\n45:18.840 --> 45:20.480\n Should we not do it?\n\n45:20.480 --> 45:24.760\n What is the downside of doing it?\n\n45:24.760 --> 45:27.320\n I don't see a downside at this very moment.\n\n45:27.320 --> 45:30.040\n If we invited a lot of people,\n\n45:30.040 --> 45:33.440\n I'm sure there would be somebody who would argue against it.\n\n45:33.440 --> 45:37.920\n What would be the devil's advocate argument?\n\n45:37.920 --> 45:39.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n45:39.680 --> 45:42.960\n So it's exactly perhaps what you alluded at\n\n45:42.960 --> 45:44.280\n with your question,\n\n45:44.280 --> 45:51.280\n that you are enabling some process of formation of the brain\n\n45:51.640 --> 45:54.400\n that could be misused at some point,\n\n45:54.400 --> 45:59.040\n or that could be showing properties\n\n45:59.040 --> 46:03.960\n that ethically we don't wanna see in a tissue.\n\n46:03.960 --> 46:07.720\n So today, I repeat, today, this is not an issue.\n\n46:07.720 --> 46:11.680\n And so you just gain dramatically from the science without,\n\n46:11.680 --> 46:15.240\n because the system is so simple and so different\n\n46:15.240 --> 46:17.800\n in a way from the actual brain.\n\n46:17.800 --> 46:19.960\n But because it is the brain,\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:23.920\n we have an obligation to really consider all of this, right?\n\n46:23.920 --> 46:27.160\n And again, it's a balanced conversation\n\n46:27.160 --> 46:30.320\n where we should put disease and betterment of humanity\n\n46:30.320 --> 46:32.400\n also on that plate.\n\n46:32.400 --> 46:35.400\n What do you think, at least historically,\n\n46:35.400 --> 46:37.240\n there was some politicization,\n\n46:37.240 --> 46:42.240\n politicization of embryonic stem cells,\n\n46:44.280 --> 46:46.480\n a stem cell research.\n\n46:46.480 --> 46:49.440\n Do you still see that out there?\n\n46:49.440 --> 46:53.520\n Is that still a force that we have to think about,\n\n46:53.520 --> 46:55.520\n especially in this larger discourse\n\n46:55.520 --> 46:57.520\n that we're having about the role of science\n\n46:57.520 --> 47:00.560\n in at least American society?\n\n47:00.560 --> 47:03.440\n Yeah, this is a very good question.\n\n47:03.440 --> 47:04.960\n It's very, very important.\n\n47:04.960 --> 47:08.440\n I see a very central role for scientists\n\n47:08.440 --> 47:12.000\n to inform decisions about what we should\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.400\n or should not do in society.\n\n47:14.400 --> 47:16.360\n And this is because the scientists\n\n47:16.360 --> 47:20.400\n have the firsthand look and understanding\n\n47:20.400 --> 47:23.480\n of really the work that they are doing.\n\n47:23.480 --> 47:26.040\n And again, this varies depending on\n\n47:26.040 --> 47:27.440\n what we're talking about here.\n\n47:27.440 --> 47:31.080\n So now we're talking about brain organoids.\n\n47:31.080 --> 47:33.760\n I think that the scientists need to be part\n\n47:33.760 --> 47:36.480\n of that conversation about what is,\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:37.960\n will be allowed in the future\n\n47:37.960 --> 47:40.760\n or not allowed in the future to do with the system.\n\n47:40.760 --> 47:43.320\n And I think that is very, very important\n\n47:43.320 --> 47:47.840\n because they bring the reality of data to the conversation.\n\n47:48.840 --> 47:51.640\n And so they should have a voice.\n\n47:51.640 --> 47:53.320\n So data should have a voice.\n\n47:53.320 --> 47:55.160\n Data needs to have a voice.\n\n47:55.160 --> 47:57.280\n Because in not only data,\n\n47:57.280 --> 48:01.120\n we should also be good at communicating\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:04.200\n with non scientists, the data.\n\n48:04.200 --> 48:06.800\n So there has been often time,\n\n48:06.800 --> 48:11.000\n there is a lot of discussion and, you know,\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:16.000\n excitement and fights about certain topics\n\n48:16.280 --> 48:19.280\n just because of the way they are described.\n\n48:19.280 --> 48:20.960\n I'll give you an example.\n\n48:20.960 --> 48:23.360\n If I called the same cellular system\n\n48:23.360 --> 48:27.040\n we just talked about a brain organoid,\n\n48:27.040 --> 48:30.280\n or if I called it a human mini brain,\n\n48:30.280 --> 48:34.560\n your reaction is gonna be very different to this.\n\n48:34.560 --> 48:37.720\n And so the way the systems are described,\n\n48:37.720 --> 48:42.480\n I mean, we and journalists alike need to be a bit careful\n\n48:42.480 --> 48:46.040\n that this debate is a real debate and informed by real data.\n\n48:46.040 --> 48:47.920\n That's all I'm asking.\n\n48:47.920 --> 48:49.560\n And yeah, the language matters here.\n\n48:49.560 --> 48:51.280\n So I work on autonomous vehicles\n\n48:51.280 --> 48:53.000\n and there the use of language\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:56.440\n could drastically change the interpretation\n\n48:56.440 --> 48:58.480\n and the way people feel about\n\n48:58.480 --> 49:01.480\n what is the right way to proceed forward.\n\n49:01.480 --> 49:06.200\n You are, as I've seen from a presentation, you're a parent.\n\n49:06.200 --> 49:09.800\n I saw you show a couple of pictures of your son.\n\n49:09.800 --> 49:11.400\n Is it just the one?\n\n49:11.400 --> 49:12.240\n Two.\n\n49:12.240 --> 49:13.080\n Two.\n\n49:13.080 --> 49:13.920\n Son and a daughter.\n\n49:13.920 --> 49:14.760\n Son and a daughter.\n\n49:14.760 --> 49:17.320\n So what have you learned from the human brain\n\n49:17.320 --> 49:20.040\n by raising two of them?\n\n49:20.040 --> 49:22.640\n More than I could ever learn in the lab.\n\n49:24.480 --> 49:25.560\n What have I learned?\n\n49:25.560 --> 49:27.480\n I've learned that children really have\n\n49:27.480 --> 49:30.480\n these amazing plastic minds, right?\n\n49:30.480 --> 49:34.800\n That we have a responsibility to, you know,\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:37.440\n foster their growth in good, healthy ways.\n\n49:38.360 --> 49:41.360\n That keep them curious, that keeps them adventurous,\n\n49:41.360 --> 49:44.800\n that doesn't raise them in fear of things.\n\n49:45.800 --> 49:47.920\n But also respecting who they are,\n\n49:47.920 --> 49:49.040\n which is in part, you know,\n\n49:49.040 --> 49:51.360\n coming from the genetics we talked about.\n\n49:51.360 --> 49:53.560\n My children are very different from each other\n\n49:53.560 --> 49:55.560\n despite the fact that they're the product of\n\n49:55.560 --> 49:56.920\n the same two parents.\n\n49:58.440 --> 50:03.440\n I also learned that what you do for them comes back to you.\n\n50:03.440 --> 50:05.000\n Like, you know, if you're a good parent,\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:08.000\n you're gonna, most of the time,\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:11.240\n have, you know, perhaps a decent kids at the end.\n\n50:11.240 --> 50:12.960\n So what do you think, just a quick comment,\n\n50:12.960 --> 50:16.920\n what do you think is the source of that difference?\n\n50:16.920 --> 50:20.400\n That's often the surprising thing for parents.\n\n50:20.400 --> 50:23.880\n Is that they can't believe that our kids,\n\n50:23.880 --> 50:26.360\n oh, they're so different,\n\n50:26.360 --> 50:28.000\n yet they came from the same parents.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:29.560\n Well, they are genetically different.\n\n50:29.560 --> 50:31.880\n Even they came from the same two parents\n\n50:31.880 --> 50:33.600\n because the mixing of gametes,\n\n50:33.600 --> 50:35.640\n you know, we know this genetics,\n\n50:35.640 --> 50:39.760\n creates every time a genetically different individual,\n\n50:39.760 --> 50:43.680\n which will have a specific mix of genes\n\n50:43.680 --> 50:46.480\n that is a different mix every time from the two parents.\n\n50:46.480 --> 50:50.280\n And so they're not twins.\n\n50:50.280 --> 50:52.800\n They are genetically different.\n\n50:52.800 --> 50:55.320\n Even just that little bit of variation,\n\n50:55.320 --> 50:58.320\n because you said really from a biological perspective,\n\n50:58.320 --> 51:00.600\n the brains look pretty similar.\n\n51:00.600 --> 51:02.400\n Well, so let me clarify that.\n\n51:02.400 --> 51:05.440\n So the genetics you have, the genes that you have,\n\n51:05.440 --> 51:08.680\n that play that beautiful orchestrated symphony\n\n51:08.680 --> 51:12.040\n of development, different genes\n\n51:12.040 --> 51:13.920\n will play it slightly differently.\n\n51:13.920 --> 51:16.120\n It's like playing the same piece of music,\n\n51:16.120 --> 51:20.000\n but with a different orchestra and a different director.\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:21.480\n The music will not come out.\n\n51:21.480 --> 51:25.440\n It will be still a piece by the same author,\n\n51:25.440 --> 51:27.080\n but it will come out differently\n\n51:27.080 --> 51:28.960\n if it's played by the high school orchestra\n\n51:28.960 --> 51:33.480\n instead of the Scala in Milan.\n\n51:34.680 --> 51:39.360\n And so you are born superficially with the same brain.\n\n51:39.360 --> 51:41.240\n It has the same cell types,\n\n51:41.240 --> 51:43.440\n similar patterns of connectivity,\n\n51:43.440 --> 51:45.240\n but the properties of the cells\n\n51:45.240 --> 51:47.600\n and how the cells will then react to the environment\n\n51:47.600 --> 51:51.320\n as you experience your world will be also shaped\n\n51:51.320 --> 51:53.680\n by who genetically you are.\n\n51:53.680 --> 51:55.120\n Speaking just as a parent,\n\n51:55.120 --> 51:56.880\n this is not something that comes from my work.\n\n51:56.880 --> 52:01.080\n I think you can tell at birth that these kids are different,\n\n52:01.080 --> 52:04.560\n that they have a different personality in a way, right?\n\n52:05.560 --> 52:08.720\n So both is needed, the genetics,\n\n52:08.720 --> 52:10.600\n as well as the nurturing afterwards.\n\n52:11.600 --> 52:15.480\n So you are one human with a brain,\n\n52:15.480 --> 52:17.680\n sort of living through the whole mess of it,\n\n52:17.680 --> 52:21.520\n the human condition, full of love, maybe fear,\n\n52:21.520 --> 52:23.400\n ultimately mortal.\n\n52:24.480 --> 52:27.680\n How has studying the brain changed the way you see yourself?\n\n52:27.680 --> 52:30.480\n When you look in the mirror, when you think about your life,\n\n52:30.480 --> 52:33.440\n the fears, the love, when you see your own life,\n\n52:33.440 --> 52:34.640\n your own mortality.\n\n52:34.640 --> 52:37.360\n Yeah, that's a very good question.\n\n52:38.520 --> 52:43.520\n It's almost impossible to dissociate some time for me.\n\n52:43.520 --> 52:46.200\n Some of the things we do or some of the things\n\n52:46.200 --> 52:48.520\n that other people do from,\n\n52:48.520 --> 52:51.400\n oh, that's because that part of the brain\n\n52:52.320 --> 52:54.400\n is working in a certain way.\n\n52:54.400 --> 52:58.120\n Or thinking about a teenager,\n\n52:59.560 --> 53:02.160\n going through teenage years and being at time funny\n\n53:02.160 --> 53:03.840\n in the way they think.\n\n53:03.840 --> 53:07.480\n And impossible for me not to think it's because\n\n53:07.480 --> 53:09.680\n they're going through this period of time\n\n53:09.680 --> 53:13.040\n called critical periods of plasticity\n\n53:13.040 --> 53:16.200\n where their synapses are being eliminated here and there,\n\n53:16.200 --> 53:17.560\n and they're just confused.\n\n53:17.560 --> 53:22.080\n And so from that comes perhaps a different take\n\n53:22.080 --> 53:27.080\n on that behavior, or maybe I can justify it scientifically\n\n53:27.880 --> 53:29.880\n in some sort of way.\n\n53:29.880 --> 53:32.080\n I also look at humanity in general,\n\n53:32.080 --> 53:36.840\n and I am amazed by what we can do\n\n53:36.840 --> 53:39.760\n and the kind of ideas that we can come up with.\n\n53:39.760 --> 53:43.480\n And I cannot stop thinking about how the brain\n\n53:43.480 --> 53:46.200\n is continuing to evolve.\n\n53:46.200 --> 53:47.120\n I don't know if you do this,\n\n53:47.120 --> 53:49.480\n but I think about the next brain sometimes.\n\n53:49.480 --> 53:50.880\n Where are we going with this?\n\n53:50.880 --> 53:53.680\n Like, what are the features of this brain\n\n53:53.680 --> 53:57.680\n that evolution is really playing with\n\n53:57.680 --> 54:02.320\n to get us in the future, the new brain?\n\n54:02.320 --> 54:04.040\n It's not over, right?\n\n54:04.040 --> 54:06.960\n It's a work in progress.\n\n54:06.960 --> 54:09.040\n So let me just a quick comment on that.\n\n54:09.040 --> 54:14.040\n Do you think there's a lot of fascination\n\n54:14.240 --> 54:15.960\n and hope for artificial intelligence\n\n54:15.960 --> 54:17.720\n of creating artificial brains?\n\n54:17.720 --> 54:20.080\n You said the next brain.\n\n54:20.080 --> 54:23.360\n When you imagine over a period of a thousand years,\n\n54:23.360 --> 54:25.480\n the evolution of the human brain,\n\n54:25.480 --> 54:28.680\n do you sometimes envisioning that future\n\n54:28.680 --> 54:32.400\n see an artificial one, artificial intelligence,\n\n54:32.400 --> 54:34.920\n as it is hoped by many, not hoped,\n\n54:34.920 --> 54:37.440\n thought by many people would be actually\n\n54:37.440 --> 54:40.440\n the next evolutionary step in the development of humans?\n\n54:40.440 --> 54:45.240\n Yeah, I think in a way that will happen, right?\n\n54:45.240 --> 54:48.520\n It's almost like a part of the way we evolve.\n\n54:48.520 --> 54:51.160\n We evolve in the world that we created,\n\n54:51.160 --> 54:55.280\n that we interact with, that shape us as we grow up\n\n54:55.280 --> 54:56.480\n and so on and so forth.\n\n54:58.200 --> 55:00.880\n Sometime I think about something that may sound silly,\n\n55:00.880 --> 55:04.480\n but think about the use of cell phones.\n\n55:04.480 --> 55:07.000\n Part of me thinks that somehow in their brain,\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\n there will be a region of the cortex\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:13.560\n that is attuned to that tool.\n\n55:13.560 --> 55:16.440\n And this comes from a lot of studies\n\n55:16.440 --> 55:20.840\n in modern organisms where really the cortex,\n\n55:20.840 --> 55:24.080\n especially adapts to the kind of things you have to do.\n\n55:24.080 --> 55:28.440\n So if we need to move our fingers in a very specific way,\n\n55:28.440 --> 55:30.600\n we have a part of our cortex that allows us\n\n55:30.600 --> 55:32.880\n to do this kind of very precise movement.\n\n55:34.200 --> 55:36.800\n An owl that has to see very, very far away\n\n55:36.800 --> 55:39.800\n with big eyes, the visual cortex, very big.\n\n55:39.800 --> 55:43.120\n The brain attunes to your environment.\n\n55:43.120 --> 55:47.440\n So the brain will attune to the technologies\n\n55:47.440 --> 55:51.040\n that we will have and will be shaped by it.\n\n55:51.040 --> 55:52.800\n So the cortex very well may be.\n\n55:52.800 --> 55:54.480\n Will be shaped by it.\n\n55:54.480 --> 55:57.200\n In artificial intelligence, it may merge with it,\n\n55:57.200 --> 56:01.120\n it may get, envelop it and adjust.\n\n56:01.120 --> 56:04.040\n Even if it's not a merge of the kind of,\n\n56:04.040 --> 56:06.800\n oh, let's have a synthetic element together\n\n56:06.800 --> 56:08.640\n with a biological one.\n\n56:08.640 --> 56:11.680\n The very space around us, the fact, for example,\n\n56:11.680 --> 56:15.120\n think about we put on some goggles of virtual reality\n\n56:15.120 --> 56:18.680\n and we physically are surfing the ocean, right?\n\n56:18.680 --> 56:19.960\n Like I've done it.\n\n56:19.960 --> 56:22.600\n And you have all these emotions that come to you.\n\n56:22.600 --> 56:27.000\n Your brain placed you in that reality.\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.520\n And it was able to do it like that\n\n56:29.520 --> 56:31.000\n just by putting the goggles on.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:35.840\n It didn't take thousands of years of adapting to this.\n\n56:35.840 --> 56:37.320\n The brain is plastic.\n\n56:37.320 --> 56:39.160\n So adapts to new technology.\n\n56:39.160 --> 56:41.600\n So you could do it from the outside\n\n56:41.600 --> 56:46.600\n by simply hijacking some sensory capacities that we have.\n\n56:47.480 --> 56:51.440\n So clearly over recent evolution,\n\n56:51.440 --> 56:53.800\n the cerebral cortex has been a part of the brain\n\n56:53.800 --> 56:55.840\n that has known the most evolution.\n\n56:55.840 --> 56:58.240\n So we have put a lot of chips\n\n56:58.240 --> 57:02.440\n on evolving this specific part of the brain.\n\n57:02.440 --> 57:05.800\n And the evolution of cortex is plasticity.\n\n57:05.800 --> 57:10.120\n It's this ability to change in response to things.\n\n57:10.120 --> 57:12.240\n So yes, they will integrate.\n\n57:12.240 --> 57:13.640\n That we want it or not.\n\n57:14.800 --> 57:18.000\n Well, there's no better way to end it, Paola.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:19.320\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n57:19.320 --> 57:20.160\n You're very welcome.\n\n57:20.160 --> 57:41.560\n This is very exciting.\n\n"
