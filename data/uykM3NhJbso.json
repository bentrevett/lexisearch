  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.200\n The following is a conversation with Michael Malice, his second time on the podcast.\n\n00:05.200 --> 00:10.320\n He's an anarchist, political thinker, podcaster, and author.\n\n00:10.320 --> 00:17.260\n He wrote Dear Reader, which is a book on North Korea, and The New Right, a book on the various\n\n00:17.260 --> 00:20.940\n ideological movements at the fringe of American politics.\n\n00:20.940 --> 00:26.960\n He hosts a podcast called You're Welcome, spelled Y O U R, and in general, there's\n\n00:26.960 --> 00:33.780\n a lot of live shows on YouTube that are at times profoundly absurd, and at other times\n\n00:33.780 --> 00:38.720\n absurdly profound, and always full of humor and wisdom.\n\n00:38.720 --> 00:44.100\n He is the Joker to my Batman, and the Caviar to my Vodka.\n\n00:44.100 --> 00:50.320\n His masterful dance between dark humor and difficult, even dangerous ideas, challenges\n\n00:50.320 --> 00:55.920\n me to think deeply about this world, and when that fails, at least smile and have a good\n\n00:55.920 --> 00:58.560\n laugh at the absurdity of it all.\n\n00:58.560 --> 01:00.880\n This episode has much of that.\n\n01:00.880 --> 01:10.320\n His outfit, for example, the exact inverse of mine, with a white suit and a black shirt,\n\n01:10.320 --> 01:18.560\n is just one example of that, of the humor, trolling, and brilliance that is Michael Malice.\n\n01:18.560 --> 01:25.560\n Quick mention of our sponsors, NetSuite, Business Management Software, Athletic Greens, All\n\n01:25.560 --> 01:32.560\n In One Nutrition Drink, Sun Basket, Meal Delivery Service, and Cash App.\n\n01:32.560 --> 01:38.320\n So the choice is success, health, food, or money.\n\n01:38.320 --> 01:43.540\n Choose wisely, my friends, and if you wish, click the sponsor links below to get a discount\n\n01:43.540 --> 01:46.040\n and to support this podcast.\n\n01:46.040 --> 01:52.200\n As a side note, let me say that Michael is, in many ways, a man of radical ideas, but\n\n01:52.200 --> 01:55.380\n also a man with kindness in his heart.\n\n01:55.380 --> 01:59.560\n Those two things are great ingredients for a fascinating conversation.\n\n01:59.560 --> 02:05.240\n I hope to have several such people on this podcast this upcoming year who also have radical\n\n02:05.240 --> 02:09.400\n ideas about politics, science, technology, and life.\n\n02:09.400 --> 02:15.200\n At times, often perhaps, I might fail at asking the challenging questions that should be asked,\n\n02:15.200 --> 02:20.320\n but I will try my best to do so, and hope to keep improving every time.\n\n02:20.320 --> 02:25.480\n Mostly, I come to these conversations with an open mind and with love.\n\n02:25.480 --> 02:29.280\n Unfortunately, that kind of approach can be taken advantage of in many ways.\n\n02:29.280 --> 02:35.000\n It can be used by reporters or just people online later to highlight how or why I'm\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:39.840\n ignorant or worse, I'm generally not a good human being.\n\n02:39.840 --> 02:42.040\n In the context of this, I have two options.\n\n02:42.040 --> 02:48.520\n I could either be cautious and afraid, or second, be kind, thoughtful, and fearless.\n\n02:48.520 --> 02:50.240\n I choose the latter.\n\n02:50.240 --> 02:53.680\n Hopefully while still being open, fragile, and empathetic.\n\n02:53.680 --> 02:59.480\n Again, I strive to be like the main character of The Idiot by Dostoevsky.\n\n02:59.480 --> 03:01.400\n That's my New Year's resolution.\n\n03:01.400 --> 03:04.120\n Be kind and do difficult things.\n\n03:04.120 --> 03:09.520\n Difficult conversations, difficult research projects, and difficult entrepreneurial adventures.\n\n03:09.520 --> 03:16.160\n If you enjoy this thing,

And now, here's my conversation with Michael Malice.\n\n03:25.600 --> 03:26.600\n Knock knock.\n\n03:26.600 --> 03:27.600\n You're stealing my bed?\n\n03:27.600 --> 03:28.600\n I'll kill your family.\n\n03:28.600 --> 03:35.320\n That's not how a knock knock joke works.\n\n03:35.320 --> 03:36.320\n Knock knock, Michael.\n\n03:36.320 --> 03:41.240\n You don't do knock knock jokes with Russians because if we have a knock at the door, turn\n\n03:41.240 --> 03:42.240\n down the TV.\n\n03:42.240 --> 03:43.240\n You got to sit quiet.\n\n03:43.240 --> 03:44.240\n We hope they go away.\n\n03:44.240 --> 03:45.240\n You don't do that back in the motherland.\n\n03:45.240 --> 03:46.240\n You know this.\n\n03:46.240 --> 03:47.240\n It's triggering.\n\n03:47.240 --> 03:48.240\n Who's there?\n\n03:48.240 --> 03:53.960\n I can't even do it now.\n\n03:53.960 --> 03:54.960\n Knock knock.\n\n03:54.960 --> 03:55.960\n Who's there?\n\n03:55.960 --> 03:56.960\n Leon.\n\n03:56.960 --> 03:58.600\n Leon who?\n\n03:58.600 --> 04:00.960\n Leon me when you're not strong, Michael.\n\n04:00.960 --> 04:03.720\n Well, that will never happen.\n\n04:03.720 --> 04:08.240\n I stole elegantly, eloquently that joke from you.\n\n04:08.240 --> 04:10.680\n The lie detector term, that was a lie.\n\n04:10.680 --> 04:11.680\n Elegantly and eloquently.\n\n04:11.680 --> 04:12.680\n Oh.\n\n04:12.680 --> 04:17.320\n Yeah, you crossed it out on a sheet of paper.\n\n04:17.320 --> 04:18.900\n That means it's real.\n\n04:18.900 --> 04:25.120\n The reason I bring it up is because you had the guts, the brilliance to do a knock knock\n\n04:25.120 --> 04:26.120\n joke.\n\n04:26.120 --> 04:28.240\n Not once, but three times with Alex Jones.\n\n04:28.240 --> 04:29.240\n I think it was like six.\n\n04:29.240 --> 04:30.240\n I had a runner.\n\n04:30.240 --> 04:31.240\n Okay.\n\n04:31.240 --> 04:37.040\n Maybe they started to sort of melt together in this beautiful art form that you've created,\n\n04:37.040 --> 04:40.800\n which is like these kind, loving knock knock jokes with Alex Jones.\n\n04:40.800 --> 04:47.560\n So you got the chance to meet him and talk to him twice with Tim Pool in a long form\n\n04:47.560 --> 04:48.560\n conversation.\n\n04:48.560 --> 04:56.920\n What was it like talking to Alex Jones, both on the deep philosophical intellectual level\n\n04:56.920 --> 05:04.920\n and staring the man in his eyes and doing a knock knock joke about Olive knock knock.\n\n05:04.920 --> 05:05.920\n Who's there?\n\n05:05.920 --> 05:06.920\n Olive.\n\n05:06.920 --> 05:07.920\n I love you, Alex.\n\n05:07.920 --> 05:08.920\n I love you.\n\n05:08.920 --> 05:11.440\n Well, there's a lot to explain.\n\n05:11.440 --> 05:12.440\n Where do you start?\n\n05:12.440 --> 05:17.520\n I've been on his show Infowars a few times when I was researching my book, Then You Write.\n\n05:17.520 --> 05:20.480\n So I had had conversations with him before.\n\n05:20.480 --> 05:25.500\n One of the things that I appreciate about Alex is he is a lot more self aware than people\n\n05:25.500 --> 05:28.280\n think and has a good sense of humor.\n\n05:28.280 --> 05:32.260\n And I also like a good twist ending.\n\n05:32.260 --> 05:37.520\n So if you set people up and all these jokes are these kind of vapid, you know, all of\n\n05:37.520 --> 05:41.920\n you jokes and the last one's about building seven, they're not going to see that one coming\n\n05:41.920 --> 05:43.400\n nor will he see that one coming.\n\n05:43.400 --> 05:46.960\n I even had another one about Sandy Hook, which I didn't do on the air because he was being\n\n05:46.960 --> 05:52.640\n like a good sport, but that was the dagger that was kind of behind my back if necessary.\n\n05:52.640 --> 05:57.700\n But it was a good mechanism toward I like it when things work on several levels.\n\n05:57.700 --> 06:03.240\n It was also a good mechanism to keep kind of the conversation guarded and this every\n\n06:03.240 --> 06:09.480\n so often, this is kind of hitting the control, alt, delete and bring it down to a certain\n\n06:09.480 --> 06:11.080\n point of calmness.\n\n06:11.080 --> 06:12.080\n What about the love thing?\n\n06:12.080 --> 06:19.800\n I mean, you're saying that that was a buildup to the dagger, but it was also somehow really\n\n06:19.800 --> 06:23.780\n refreshing to get that little jolt, like that pause.\n\n06:23.780 --> 06:25.480\n You don't get that in conversations often.\n\n06:25.480 --> 06:30.640\n Like I'm a huge fan of Rogan and he'll have a three hour conversation, but at some point\n\n06:30.640 --> 06:35.680\n just pause and be like, I love you, man.\n\n06:35.680 --> 06:42.760\n Like it's in the cheesiest way possible because that seems to be, it somehow hits the hardest\n\n06:42.760 --> 06:43.760\n then.\n\n06:43.760 --> 06:44.760\n I don't know.\n\n06:44.760 --> 06:48.840\n I don't know you didn't intend it that way, but with Alex Jones to sit there and to say,\n\n06:48.840 --> 06:50.960\n I love you.\n\n06:50.960 --> 06:55.120\n That was like, I just haven't never heard that before.\n\n06:55.120 --> 07:00.220\n And so it struck me as like, not just funny for what you're doing, but just like, whoa,\n\n07:00.220 --> 07:04.640\n we just took, cause conversations are all about like this ranting, especially with Alex\n\n07:04.640 --> 07:08.880\n Jones, just like ranting about this or that, this part of the world, like, can you believe\n\n07:08.880 --> 07:09.880\n this shit?\n\n07:09.880 --> 07:10.880\n That kind of thing.\n\n07:10.880 --> 07:13.400\n But like to pause and be like, this is awesome.\n\n07:13.400 --> 07:15.000\n I don't know if you felt that way, but.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.240\n Oh, I definitely felt that way.\n\n07:16.240 --> 07:17.240\n So it was actually very fun.\n\n07:17.240 --> 07:22.080\n I'll give you the backstory of how that happened.\n\n07:22.080 --> 07:26.620\n It was silly cause Tim calls me up and there's this expression in marketing, don't go past\n\n07:26.620 --> 07:27.620\n the sale.\n\n07:27.620 --> 07:28.620\n Right?\n\n07:28.620 --> 07:32.400\n You're gonna buy someone a car and like, it's got this feature, this feature and that feature.\n\n07:32.400 --> 07:33.400\n And they're like, you know what?\n\n07:33.400 --> 07:34.580\n I'm going to buy the car.\n\n07:34.580 --> 07:38.060\n If you keep talking, you can only make them lose the sale.\n\n07:38.060 --> 07:41.120\n You just get them to sign and get, get out of Dodge.\n\n07:41.120 --> 07:47.080\n So Tim calls me up and he goes, okay, here's what we're thinking.\n\n07:47.080 --> 07:48.080\n This is top secret.\n\n07:48.080 --> 07:50.000\n Alex is going to be on the show.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.340\n We want you on as well.\n\n07:51.340 --> 07:54.920\n And I've never said yes to anything as quickly in my life.\n\n07:54.920 --> 07:58.240\n And then he keeps talking and I'm like, Tim, this, you don't have to sell it.\n\n07:58.240 --> 07:59.240\n I interrupted him.\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:00.240\n I go, you don't have to sell it.\n\n08:00.240 --> 08:01.600\n Why you, by the way?\n\n08:01.600 --> 08:10.520\n I think because I am kind of an agent of chaos and Alex is in his own way, an agent of chaos.\n\n08:10.520 --> 08:15.560\n And what is, provides an opportunity in this kind of news media space that you and I travel\n\n08:15.560 --> 08:20.960\n in, it's the kind of things where none of us three, you know, as we said on the show,\n\n08:20.960 --> 08:22.520\n knew what it would be like.\n\n08:22.520 --> 08:28.400\n If you, you know, to certain, within certain parameters, what, you know, Megyn Kelly or\n\n08:28.400 --> 08:32.520\n Wolf Blitzer or any of these corporate figures are going to be like in a conversation to\n\n08:32.520 --> 08:35.360\n some extent, none of us had any idea.\n\n08:35.360 --> 08:39.080\n I knew they didn't know I was bringing in knocking up jokes.\n\n08:39.080 --> 08:42.480\n So that was kind of what was so exciting.\n\n08:42.480 --> 08:47.160\n I said at one point, I'm kind of envious of the audience because this is, there's so many\n\n08:47.160 --> 08:52.000\n exciting things that are happening and that the internet and podcasting provides people\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:53.880\n an opportunity to do that.\n\n08:53.880 --> 08:54.880\n It was great.\n\n08:54.880 --> 08:55.880\n Yeah.\n\n08:55.880 --> 09:02.080\n That, that was the greatest pairing with Alex Jones that I've ever seen by far.\n\n09:02.080 --> 09:08.960\n So like, so I immediately knew now this isn't a knock on Tim, but I don't even know if Tim\n\n09:08.960 --> 09:09.960\n was prepared.\n\n09:09.960 --> 09:11.400\n Tim was not prepared.\n\n09:11.400 --> 09:12.400\n For this.\n\n09:12.400 --> 09:13.400\n How could he be prepared?\n\n09:13.400 --> 09:16.360\n Well, so I mean, I don't know if Tim is used to that.\n\n09:16.360 --> 09:22.120\n I think Joe Rogan is more equipped, prepared for the chaos, just the years he's been in\n\n09:22.120 --> 09:23.120\n it.\n\n09:23.120 --> 09:27.640\n Like I immediately thought this is the right pairing for Joe Rogan because Alex Jones has\n\n09:27.640 --> 09:31.300\n been on Joe Rogan a few times, three times.\n\n09:31.300 --> 09:39.240\n My favorite so far was with Tim Dillon, but Tim was clearly, Tim Dillon was also kind\n\n09:39.240 --> 09:48.000\n of a genius in his own right, but he was kind of a fan and he was stepping away.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:58.400\n He was almost like in awe of Alex Jones where you were both, you were in awe of the experience\n\n09:58.400 --> 10:04.000\n that's being created and at the same time fearlessly just trolling the situation.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.760\n I mean, to do a knock, knock joke, to stop, I mean, that just shows that you're in control\n\n10:08.760 --> 10:09.760\n of the experience.\n\n10:09.760 --> 10:11.440\n No, you're like riding the experience.\n\n10:11.440 --> 10:14.720\n That immediately was like, this needs to be on Rogan.\n\n10:14.720 --> 10:18.080\n So I hope that happens as well.\n\n10:18.080 --> 10:22.440\n You're on your own, of course, on Rogan, but just you, that's an experience.\n\n10:22.440 --> 10:24.720\n That's the, whatever, this gotta be a good name for it.\n\n10:24.720 --> 10:27.520\n Like Jimi Hendrix Experience, there's the Michael and Alex.\n\n10:27.520 --> 10:29.080\n Because that was a band.\n\n10:29.080 --> 10:30.080\n It's taken.\n\n10:30.080 --> 10:35.360\n Well, I don't know how many years you can restart the experience.\n\n10:35.360 --> 10:42.040\n Because I feel sorry to interrupt you, I feel a very big responsibility, especially in 2020\n\n10:42.040 --> 10:49.560\n to provide fun and something cool and something unique that hasn't been done before for the\n\n10:49.560 --> 10:50.560\n audience.\n\n10:50.560 --> 10:55.560\n I think this has been a very rough year on our audiences psychologically and in other\n\n10:55.560 --> 10:57.200\n aspects of their lives.\n\n10:57.200 --> 11:02.920\n So I feel if I'm going to be there, I'm going to put on a show and it's also going to be\n\n11:02.920 --> 11:06.360\n great because it also alienates the people you don't want.\n\n11:06.360 --> 11:09.760\n So there's a lot of people who sit there and be like, oh, he's telling knock, people who\n\n11:09.760 --> 11:13.560\n are too cool for school, where they're like, oh, he's telling knock, knock jokes.\n\n11:13.560 --> 11:14.560\n This is stupid.\n\n11:14.560 --> 11:15.560\n I'm like, good.\n\n11:15.560 --> 11:22.920\n If you have an issue with having eaten cotton candy or doing a puzzle with a kid or with\n\n11:22.920 --> 11:26.520\n that by yourself, that's on you.\n\n11:26.520 --> 11:31.040\n And it's something very, something I think is the enemy is cynicism and this idea that\n\n11:31.040 --> 11:36.520\n like, oh, this is too silly and we need that kind of childlike aspect in our lives.\n\n11:36.520 --> 11:38.360\n I think it's something we could use more of.\n\n11:38.360 --> 11:42.840\n It's very much an aspect of our media culture that to kind of have be condemnatory about\n\n11:42.840 --> 11:46.400\n that or to do it in a certain very corporate fake way.\n\n11:46.400 --> 11:51.560\n So it is something I encourage a lot, something I enjoy doing.\n\n11:51.560 --> 11:56.640\n And again, like with the first time I was on Tim, I had a propeller beanie on, you know,\n\n11:56.640 --> 12:00.880\n with the motorized and a lot of people were like, I can't take anyone seriously who dresses\n\n12:00.880 --> 12:01.880\n like this.\n\n12:01.880 --> 12:02.880\n I go, good.\n\n12:02.880 --> 12:07.960\n If you judge someone's ideas by how they appear instead of the ideas themselves, you're not\n\n12:07.960 --> 12:10.280\n someone I want on my team.\n\n12:10.280 --> 12:15.160\n Are we going to address the outfit you're wearing?\n\n12:15.160 --> 12:16.160\n We can address it, sure.\n\n12:16.160 --> 12:25.240\n You know, for those who are colorblind, Michael's wearing the, or just listening to this, Michael's\n\n12:25.240 --> 12:31.800\n wearing the exact opposite, the universe from another dimension outfit, which is a white\n\n12:31.800 --> 12:33.800\n suit and black shirt.\n\n12:33.800 --> 12:34.800\n So genius.\n\n12:34.800 --> 12:35.800\n Okay.\n\n12:35.800 --> 12:36.800\n So.\n\n12:36.800 --> 12:37.800\n You just see the next two looks I've planned.\n\n12:37.800 --> 12:38.800\n Oh, no.\n\n12:38.800 --> 12:39.800\n Yeah, they're great.\n\n12:39.800 --> 12:42.800\n Well, obviously this relationship's going to end today.\n\n12:42.800 --> 12:43.800\n It's over.\n\n12:43.800 --> 12:47.000\n I'll put them on Insta.\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:48.000\n Okay.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.960\n Is there some deep philosophy to the humor?\n\n12:50.960 --> 12:54.540\n Is this goes to our trolling discussion?\n\n12:54.540 --> 13:02.360\n Is there some, is there like chapters to this genius or is this just what makes you smile\n\n13:02.360 --> 13:03.360\n in the morning?\n\n13:03.360 --> 13:07.120\n Well, I mean, I think you're honestly, in this case, using the word genius a little\n\n13:07.120 --> 13:08.120\n loosely.\n\n13:08.120 --> 13:09.120\n I am.\n\n13:09.120 --> 13:12.080\n I don't think this is particularly genius, but I do think it is fun.\n\n13:12.080 --> 13:13.260\n It is exuberant.\n\n13:13.260 --> 13:16.040\n It is joyous.\n\n13:16.040 --> 13:23.400\n I think the bigger my audience has gotten and the more I actually communicate with,\n\n13:23.400 --> 13:28.840\n you know, fans, I do feel it kind of kicks in these paternal maternal instincts, which\n\n13:28.840 --> 13:29.840\n is very, very odd.\n\n13:29.840 --> 13:30.840\n I did not expect to have them.\n\n13:30.840 --> 13:31.840\n What do you mean?\n\n13:31.840 --> 13:32.840\n Who's the dad?\n\n13:32.840 --> 13:33.960\n I'm the dad and the mom.\n\n13:33.960 --> 13:37.400\n I remember, and it may have been similar for you, I'm curious to hear it.\n\n13:37.400 --> 13:43.880\n For young, smart, like ambitious men, like 24 to 27 for me was a very rough period because\n\n13:43.880 --> 13:47.980\n that's the window where a lot of people get married and they kind of check out.\n\n13:47.980 --> 13:52.700\n And if you're very much kind of finding your own road, you don't know what's happening.\n\n13:52.700 --> 13:55.280\n No one's in a position to really guide you or help you.\n\n13:55.280 --> 13:56.280\n And it's tough.\n\n13:56.280 --> 13:58.840\n It's a very tough window.\n\n13:58.840 --> 14:05.040\n And what I'm finding now is having these kids who are in that position, but now instead\n\n14:05.040 --> 14:09.360\n of them stumbling along, for some of them, I'm the one who could be like, no, no, no,\n\n14:09.360 --> 14:10.360\n it's not you.\n\n14:10.360 --> 14:11.760\n It's everybody else.\n\n14:11.760 --> 14:18.340\n And to be able to give them that semblance of feeling seen, to use a cliched expression,\n\n14:18.340 --> 14:23.360\n to feel normal and that, no, no, you're the heroes here.\n\n14:23.360 --> 14:25.660\n They're the background noise.\n\n14:25.660 --> 14:30.360\n It's just really very flattering and humbling to be in that position.\n\n14:30.360 --> 14:31.960\n You have many minds, right?\n\n14:31.960 --> 14:41.280\n There's the thoughtful kind, Michael, there's like, I'm going to burn down the powerful.\n\n14:41.280 --> 14:48.100\n And then there's like, I'm going to have this just lighthearted trolling of the world, which\n\n14:48.100 --> 14:55.040\n and which of those are most important to the 27 demographic?\n\n14:55.040 --> 14:57.680\n I think it is the combination.\n\n14:57.680 --> 15:04.480\n It's like if you're making a meal, chicken Kiev, you need the chicken, you need the ham,\n\n15:04.480 --> 15:07.600\n you need the butter sauce.\n\n15:07.600 --> 15:13.280\n Because I think people, when you're young, you need to see someone who's fought the fight\n\n15:13.280 --> 15:15.960\n for you and who's won.\n\n15:15.960 --> 15:18.560\n So it's very easy to be defeatist.\n\n15:18.560 --> 15:20.880\n So this is what winning looks like.\n\n15:20.880 --> 15:23.300\n No, this is not.\n\n15:23.300 --> 15:26.040\n This is most assuredly what winning does not look like.\n\n15:26.040 --> 15:29.680\n But in my normal clothes, a little bit more.\n\n15:29.680 --> 15:34.720\n This is a good time to mention that clothes wise, you're wearing sheath underwear.\n\n15:34.720 --> 15:37.180\n And people should buy sheath underwear.\n\n15:37.180 --> 15:38.180\n Use code Malice20.\n\n15:38.180 --> 15:42.240\n If you go to sheathunderwear.com, use promo code Malice20.\n\n15:42.240 --> 15:46.600\n What I love about why I'm glad to promote the product and wear it, it's the most comfortable\n\n15:46.600 --> 15:48.160\n underwear I've ever worn.\n\n15:48.160 --> 15:51.880\n And you have a separate pouch for both parts of your genitals.\n\n15:51.880 --> 15:54.000\n That's what I thought there was like a punchline coming.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.240\n No, it's a very nice aspect of the product.\n\n15:56.240 --> 15:57.240\n Yeah.\n\n15:57.240 --> 16:00.420\n But I think what here's something else just goes back to what we're just talking about.\n\n16:00.420 --> 16:02.800\n There are so many and this is going to segue into this.\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:07.360\n There are so many small companies who've been devastated this year.\n\n16:07.360 --> 16:13.200\n We have not seen a sustained attack on mom and pop shops like we've seen in 2020, who\n\n16:13.200 --> 16:17.060\n are innovators and making something happen.\n\n16:17.060 --> 16:22.720\n And when you're just like one dude who's producing a product, they're a sponsor of mine.\n\n16:22.720 --> 16:28.400\n I'm happy to, first of all, it's funny that I'm pitching underwear, but it's also something\n\n16:28.400 --> 16:29.400\n I enjoy.\n\n16:29.400 --> 16:30.400\n And also you said small business.\n\n16:30.400 --> 16:31.400\n Yeah.\n\n16:31.400 --> 16:33.120\n It's microscopic, like a thimble.\n\n16:33.120 --> 16:36.120\n So this isn't a sponsor of mine, but this is a good segue.\n\n16:36.120 --> 16:39.720\n So this is, Russians, we celebrate New Year's, it's Novomgorodom.\n\n16:39.720 --> 16:43.240\n We have Dmitry, he comes down, puts a present under your pillow.\n\n16:43.240 --> 16:45.720\n So this is a company called J.L. Lawson.\n\n16:45.720 --> 16:46.720\n He's a fan of yours.\n\n16:46.720 --> 16:47.720\n He's a metal worker.\n\n16:47.720 --> 16:50.920\n And he said, can I give you something to give to Lex?\n\n16:50.920 --> 16:52.480\n I have one of his worry coins.\n\n16:52.480 --> 16:54.000\n I'll tell you what it is.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\n He's not a sponsor.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.600\n This is not, I'm not getting paid for this.\n\n16:56.600 --> 16:58.740\n So what a worry coin is, I carry it around in my butt.\n\n16:58.740 --> 17:01.500\n If you have raw denim, it's great because it brings you fades.\n\n17:01.500 --> 17:03.640\n So you carry it around with you all the time.\n\n17:03.640 --> 17:08.120\n It says worrying is like paying a debt you don't owe, right?\n\n17:08.120 --> 17:12.420\n And I carry this around and allow it to spend like a year.\n\n17:12.420 --> 17:15.720\n Next time you're worrying, and this is good advice if you don't have a worry coin.\n\n17:15.720 --> 17:20.640\n Go think about 10 years ago and what you were worried about then.\n\n17:20.640 --> 17:23.040\n And then think about, did any of those things pan out?\n\n17:23.040 --> 17:25.840\n And some of them did, but you were able to handle it.\n\n17:25.840 --> 17:28.600\n And that's a good way to maintain perspective.\n\n17:28.600 --> 17:30.440\n So J.L. Lawson is the company.\n\n17:30.440 --> 17:31.440\n He sent me this present.\n\n17:31.440 --> 17:33.600\n I said, let me give it to Lex on air.\n\n17:33.600 --> 17:34.600\n So enjoy.\n\n17:34.600 --> 17:37.360\n So I have to open it up now?\n\n17:37.360 --> 17:38.360\n Yeah.\n\n17:38.360 --> 17:39.640\n J.L. Lawson and co.\n\n17:39.640 --> 17:40.920\n Two Lex from Anthony.\n\n17:40.920 --> 17:41.920\n Yeah.\n\n17:41.920 --> 17:43.400\n And I said, make something mathematical for Lex.\n\n17:43.400 --> 17:44.680\n So I don't even know what's in there.\n\n17:44.680 --> 17:45.680\n You don't know what's in there?\n\n17:45.680 --> 17:46.680\n No.\n\n17:46.680 --> 17:47.680\n And it got through his TSA.\n\n17:47.680 --> 17:49.160\n Could be a bomb.\n\n17:49.160 --> 17:50.420\n It could be.\n\n17:50.420 --> 17:54.700\n Just like this episode.\n\n17:54.700 --> 17:57.860\n Make sure you unwrap it close to the mic because it drives you for crazy.\n\n17:57.860 --> 18:03.120\n That's really the best part.\n\n18:03.120 --> 18:05.640\n Is this what an unboxing video looks like?\n\n18:05.640 --> 18:07.240\n I think so.\n\n18:07.240 --> 18:10.400\n This conversation is going to be a big hit on the internet.\n\n18:10.400 --> 18:12.960\n With the unboxing community.\n\n18:12.960 --> 18:17.480\n I need to have an excited look on my face to make sure that the reaction video, it should\n\n18:17.480 --> 18:19.880\n be an unboxing and a reaction video.\n\n18:19.880 --> 18:20.880\n Lex Freeman reacts.\n\n18:20.880 --> 18:21.880\n It's another box.\n\n18:21.880 --> 18:25.920\n It's just a series of boxes.\n\n18:25.920 --> 18:30.480\n Lex big fan since hearing you on Rogan months ago.\n\n18:30.480 --> 18:34.840\n Most of your guests are over my head, but still enjoyable.\n\n18:34.840 --> 18:40.400\n Like this episode, Michael was kind enough to want to share my work with you.\n\n18:40.400 --> 18:41.760\n Keep doing what you do.\n\n18:41.760 --> 18:42.760\n Anthony Lawson.\n\n18:42.760 --> 18:43.760\n Thanks Anthony.\n\n18:43.760 --> 18:44.760\n There's a lot in there.\n\n18:44.760 --> 18:45.760\n What is in there?\n\n18:45.760 --> 18:46.760\n Give me some.\n\n18:46.760 --> 18:47.760\n I'll open some.\n\n18:47.760 --> 18:48.760\n Okay.\n\n18:48.760 --> 18:49.760\n All right.\n\n18:49.760 --> 18:56.600\n Show it to the camera and then make sure you look excited or not or disappointed.\n\n18:56.600 --> 18:57.600\n No, this is cool.\n\n18:57.600 --> 18:58.600\n This is a worry coin.\n\n18:58.600 --> 18:59.600\n Like I was showing you.\n\n18:59.600 --> 19:03.200\n So you hold it in your hand and when you can do this with your thumb, if people are, have\n\n19:03.200 --> 19:04.200\n anxiety or whatever.\n\n19:04.200 --> 19:06.520\n Oh, there's a lot of cool stuff in here.\n\n19:06.520 --> 19:07.520\n Fibonacci coin.\n\n19:07.520 --> 19:10.320\n Oh, see, yeah, that's the math stuff.\n\n19:10.320 --> 19:11.760\n That's really awesome.\n\n19:11.760 --> 19:12.920\n This is really cool.\n\n19:12.920 --> 19:16.440\n Wait, you got a big one laying there too.\n\n19:16.440 --> 19:19.520\n That's what she said.\n\n19:19.520 --> 19:28.720\n I'm telling you last time you offended me saying I don't have humor.\n\n19:28.720 --> 19:33.320\n The spin tray micro brass and copper bronze.\n\n19:33.320 --> 19:36.480\n By the way, the packaging is epic.\n\n19:36.480 --> 19:37.480\n I think that's his top.\n\n19:37.480 --> 19:38.480\n He makes tops.\n\n19:38.480 --> 19:39.480\n Cool.\n\n19:39.480 --> 19:49.920\n Yeah, you spin it in there and it's the two different bronze and copper.\n\n19:49.920 --> 19:54.600\n I think he's the only one who makes these machined tops and then they sit in here, I\n\n19:54.600 --> 19:55.600\n guess.\n\n19:55.600 --> 19:57.640\n Yeah, but you could spin them in that section.\n\n19:57.640 --> 20:01.280\n Got it, cool.\n\n20:01.280 --> 20:02.920\n Where's the where's the worry thing?\n\n20:02.920 --> 20:03.920\n Here's the worry coin.\n\n20:03.920 --> 20:04.920\n Anyway, I wasn't listening.\n\n20:04.920 --> 20:06.960\n What were you worried about 10 years ago?\n\n20:06.960 --> 20:09.840\n 10 years ago, 2010.\n\n20:09.840 --> 20:11.200\n What would I have been worried about then?\n\n20:11.200 --> 20:12.200\n The government?\n\n20:12.200 --> 20:13.200\n No, I'm not.\n\n20:13.200 --> 20:14.200\n That's not a worry.\n\n20:14.200 --> 20:15.200\n I think...\n\n20:15.200 --> 20:16.520\n What was the North Korea book?\n\n20:16.520 --> 20:17.520\n I apologize.\n\n20:17.520 --> 20:19.840\n That came out in 2014.\n\n20:19.840 --> 20:24.840\n I went there in 2012, came out in January 2014.\n\n20:24.840 --> 20:28.280\n It still pays my rent with the royalties.\n\n20:28.280 --> 20:29.280\n The North Korea book?\n\n20:29.280 --> 20:30.280\n Yeah.\n\n20:30.280 --> 20:31.800\n See, this is why it's so much better.\n\n20:31.800 --> 20:36.400\n I gotta talk to you about self publishing because you brought that up.\n\n20:36.400 --> 20:38.880\n I'm doing the next books also going to be self published.\n\n20:38.880 --> 20:42.960\n Can we talk about self publishing?\n\n20:42.960 --> 20:45.320\n What's the whole idea of publishing?\n\n20:45.320 --> 20:49.100\n Like having a publisher and an agent because there's a bunch of people have been reaching\n\n20:49.100 --> 20:52.480\n out to me trying to get me to write a book, which is ridiculous.\n\n20:52.480 --> 20:53.480\n Why?\n\n20:53.480 --> 20:58.480\n Because people who are brilliant folks like you, like Jordan Peterson, that I think have\n\n20:58.480 --> 21:00.840\n a lot of knowledge to share with the world.\n\n21:00.840 --> 21:10.480\n I think what I feel I can contribute to the world in terms of impact is to build something.\n\n21:10.480 --> 21:12.560\n Meaning like engineering stuff.\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:13.560\n Like a book...\n\n21:13.560 --> 21:16.400\n A book has to be engineered and I'm not using that loosely.\n\n21:16.400 --> 21:17.720\n You have to engineer a book.\n\n21:17.720 --> 21:18.720\n No, for sure.\n\n21:18.720 --> 21:22.920\n What I mean is like literally a product with programming and artificial intelligence.\n\n21:22.920 --> 21:24.100\n I want to build a company.\n\n21:24.100 --> 21:25.100\n I want to...\n\n21:25.100 --> 21:31.600\n Because I have a few ideas that I feel I'm equipped and it has to do with your intuition\n\n21:31.600 --> 21:34.380\n about the way you can build a better world.\n\n21:34.380 --> 21:35.380\n You individually.\n\n21:35.380 --> 21:38.620\n Like, what can you add to the world that's a positive thing?\n\n21:38.620 --> 21:45.400\n And for me, I feel like the maximal thing I can add to the world is at least to attempt\n\n21:45.400 --> 21:49.540\n to build products that would add more love in the world.\n\n21:49.540 --> 21:50.900\n And like, so I want to focus on that.\n\n21:50.900 --> 21:57.000\n The danger of the book for me, or any kind of writing, and even this podcast is a little\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.480\n bit dangerous for me, is like, it's fun.\n\n21:59.480 --> 22:03.200\n That's for sure.\n\n22:03.200 --> 22:04.200\n It's fun.\n\n22:04.200 --> 22:07.000\n It's like it takes you into this place where you start thinking about the world.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\n You start enjoying and playing with ideas.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\n You start...\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:16.560\n And like, just your book on a Dear Reader, but also the new write.\n\n22:16.560 --> 22:22.960\n Like clearly you and I probably think similarly in the sense that you did a lot of work.\n\n22:22.960 --> 22:23.960\n Yes.\n\n22:23.960 --> 22:25.560\n This next book is killing me.\n\n22:25.560 --> 22:26.560\n Yeah.\n\n22:26.560 --> 22:33.360\n As you mentioned, often it's clear, like on your YouTube channel, which I'm a fan of,\n\n22:33.360 --> 22:37.600\n you often, it just comes out like you mentioned all of these books that you're reading.\n\n22:37.600 --> 22:43.840\n It just comes through you that you're suffering through this and it changes you.\n\n22:43.840 --> 22:49.000\n And it's clear that you're thinking deeply about the world because of this book.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:55.200\n And I feel like if you do that, that's like when I first came to this country, I read\n\n22:55.200 --> 22:56.200\n the book The Giver.\n\n22:56.200 --> 22:57.560\n I need to read it again.\n\n22:57.560 --> 23:04.400\n It's like the red pill thing is it changes you in where you can never be the same person\n\n23:04.400 --> 23:05.400\n again.\n\n23:05.400 --> 23:06.400\n Sure.\n\n23:06.400 --> 23:07.760\n I feel about a book in that same way.\n\n23:07.760 --> 23:11.040\n The moment you write a book, of course it depends on the book.\n\n23:11.040 --> 23:15.840\n I could also just write like in my field, a very technical book.\n\n23:15.840 --> 23:17.800\n No, that's a terrible idea.\n\n23:17.800 --> 23:18.800\n Yes.\n\n23:18.800 --> 23:19.800\n But that's okay.\n\n23:19.800 --> 23:20.800\n That doesn't really change you.\n\n23:20.800 --> 23:22.040\n That's just like sharing information.\n\n23:22.040 --> 23:26.800\n But like something where you're like, how do I think about this world?\n\n23:26.800 --> 23:28.640\n Can you just leave that behind you?\n\n23:28.640 --> 23:29.640\n I get it.\n\n23:29.640 --> 23:31.280\n Dude, it's being pregnant.\n\n23:31.280 --> 23:32.280\n It never escapes your brain.\n\n23:32.280 --> 23:33.280\n I'm telling you.\n\n23:33.280 --> 23:34.280\n You're absolutely right.\n\n23:34.280 --> 23:35.280\n Yeah.\n\n23:35.280 --> 23:36.280\n I don't know.\n\n23:36.280 --> 23:37.280\n It does seem to change you.\n\n23:37.280 --> 23:42.920\n The reason I bring that up is because there's this whole industry of people that seem to\n\n23:42.920 --> 23:49.120\n not really contribute much to the publication process, but they make themselves seem necessary\n\n23:49.120 --> 23:53.740\n for like, if you want to be in the New York Times bestseller list kind of thing, but also\n\n23:53.740 --> 23:59.640\n just being like reputable, which I'm allergic to that whole concept.\n\n23:59.640 --> 24:05.760\n But do you think it's possible to be on the New York Times bestseller list and be a reputable\n\n24:05.760 --> 24:09.640\n author and still be self published?\n\n24:09.640 --> 24:11.200\n Not what you would want to do.\n\n24:11.200 --> 24:12.840\n Like people like Mark Sisson, I think is his name.\n\n24:12.840 --> 24:14.160\n He wrote like the Primal Blueprints.\n\n24:14.160 --> 24:18.160\n So like if I'm getting the names correct, he's the first paleo guy, right?\n\n24:18.160 --> 24:19.960\n So he self published it.\n\n24:19.960 --> 24:20.960\n It sold gangbusters.\n\n24:20.960 --> 24:24.080\n But that would be on their health chart, I believe.\n\n24:24.080 --> 24:27.640\n And it's a little bit of a different situation.\n\n24:27.640 --> 24:30.840\n You would be reaching much more for the mainstream.\n\n24:30.840 --> 24:36.180\n You'd be giving up a lot if you go through a publisher, especially financially.\n\n24:36.180 --> 24:41.880\n But yeah, you are not going to have the cred because the publishing is a cartel.\n\n24:41.880 --> 24:44.360\n The New York Times is part of this cartel.\n\n24:44.360 --> 24:50.880\n And if you don't publish within this cartel, they will do what they can, as any cartel\n\n24:50.880 --> 24:55.800\n has to, by necessity of being cartel, to pretend you don't exist.\n\n24:55.800 --> 25:01.240\n So I was, I think, the first one to have an hour on BookTV for Dear Reader because that\n\n25:01.240 --> 25:03.660\n was a Kickstarter book.\n\n25:03.660 --> 25:12.280\n But this is something that people would have to be aware of.\n\n25:12.280 --> 25:14.660\n So you would be giving up a lot.\n\n25:14.660 --> 25:18.320\n But you'd also be giving a lot to work with a publisher because you're losing like a year\n\n25:18.320 --> 25:21.960\n and a half of your life because they're glacial and they don't care.\n\n25:21.960 --> 25:22.960\n Well, that's my problem.\n\n25:22.960 --> 25:23.960\n It's not the money.\n\n25:23.960 --> 25:27.960\n I mean, the money is whatever percent they take, 10, 20, 30, 50%.\n\n25:27.960 --> 25:29.920\n They're taking a huge chunk.\n\n25:29.920 --> 25:33.800\n So if I sell a book through St. Martin's, it's a dollar.\n\n25:33.800 --> 25:37.520\n If I sell a book through Amazon, which is Dear Reader, that's $6.\n\n25:37.520 --> 25:41.280\n So that's what, 87%, it's something crazy.\n\n25:41.280 --> 25:47.040\n But for me, what bothers me isn't the money that, for me personally, for me, what bothers\n\n25:47.040 --> 25:48.040\n me is incompetence.\n\n25:48.040 --> 25:50.320\n Like whenever I go to the DMV or something like that.\n\n25:50.320 --> 25:51.320\n Can I interrupt you?\n\n25:51.320 --> 25:52.320\n Yeah.\n\n25:52.320 --> 25:53.320\n Let's talk incompetence.\n\n25:53.320 --> 26:00.800\n When a new write comes out last year, I get on Rogan, get on Ruben.\n\n26:00.800 --> 26:04.720\n I call them and I said, I got on these shows.\n\n26:04.720 --> 26:08.240\n Is there money in the budget for travel?\n\n26:08.240 --> 26:10.920\n And they say, we don't have that budget.\n\n26:10.920 --> 26:11.920\n Fine.\n\n26:11.920 --> 26:14.800\n By the way, you got on those shows with no help from them.\n\n26:14.800 --> 26:15.800\n Correct.\n\n26:15.800 --> 26:17.200\n Oh yeah, that's not even a question.\n\n26:17.200 --> 26:20.000\n The reason they would want you to do a book is because they know you could get...\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:24.380\n The only reason people get book deals nowadays, literally, is because they know that person\n\n26:24.380 --> 26:25.620\n can market their own book.\n\n26:25.620 --> 26:27.320\n That's the only way.\n\n26:27.320 --> 26:31.400\n And I got on Ruben, I got on Rogan, and they go and have the money for the budget for travel,\n\n26:31.400 --> 26:32.480\n which is fair.\n\n26:32.480 --> 26:33.920\n They can do Skype.\n\n26:33.920 --> 26:36.500\n They told me this in writing.\n\n26:36.500 --> 26:38.240\n And I'm like, okay.\n\n26:38.240 --> 26:40.440\n And they can financially cover Skype.\n\n26:40.440 --> 26:46.840\n No, but it's like, hey Joe, yeah, we don't have the budget, but you're going to do Skype.\n\n26:46.840 --> 26:47.840\n Hello?\n\n26:47.840 --> 26:48.840\n Hello?\n\n26:48.840 --> 26:57.240\n There is, another friend of mine was on a show on CNBC with Nassim Taleb, and they said\n\n26:57.240 --> 26:59.840\n Nassim wants a copy of the book.\n\n26:59.840 --> 27:04.600\n And they're like, oh yeah, it's like four o clock on Friday, so we're closed.\n\n27:04.600 --> 27:10.840\n So, and he's like, he went there, picked it up, and walked it the two blocks.\n\n27:10.840 --> 27:17.280\n So there is, it's almost cartoonish, and it's not incompetence.\n\n27:17.280 --> 27:20.160\n It's past that.\n\n27:20.160 --> 27:25.480\n It's something almost, you can't really believe that, I've had two friends who have been literally\n\n27:25.480 --> 27:31.080\n rendered suicidal because this was such a huge opportunity for them.\n\n27:31.080 --> 27:34.440\n And it was like watching their kid get beaten in front of them, and I had to talk them off\n\n27:34.440 --> 27:35.440\n the ledge.\n\n27:35.440 --> 27:39.280\n So it's, people do not appreciate how bad, here's another example.\n\n27:39.280 --> 27:41.960\n The apathy of bureaucracy, something like that.\n\n27:41.960 --> 27:44.560\n I did this book, Concierge Confidential.\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:50.120\n There's a typo in the first chapter, it ends with, I'm about to, TOO, they didn't fix it\n\n27:50.120 --> 27:51.120\n for the paperback.\n\n27:51.120 --> 27:53.040\n Who cares?\n\n27:53.040 --> 27:58.360\n It's just like, well, okay, yeah, great book by the way, it got, NPR gave it one of the\n\n27:58.360 --> 28:00.720\n books of the year, so that was good.\n\n28:00.720 --> 28:03.520\n So why participate in this?\n\n28:03.520 --> 28:07.560\n Because otherwise, New York Times is going to pretend you don't exist.\n\n28:07.560 --> 28:10.920\n Getting booked on some shows might be more difficult.\n\n28:10.920 --> 28:15.920\n Although I think that's collapsing in real time.\n\n28:15.920 --> 28:21.340\n You're not going to get reviewed necessarily on places like PW, or some others.\n\n28:21.340 --> 28:24.600\n So the new book you're working on, do you have a title yet?\n\n28:24.600 --> 28:25.600\n The White Pill.\n\n28:25.600 --> 28:28.560\n The White Pill.\n\n28:28.560 --> 28:29.720\n Are you self publishing that?\n\n28:29.720 --> 28:31.120\n Oh yeah, for sure.\n\n28:31.120 --> 28:33.100\n And what's the thinking behind that?\n\n28:33.100 --> 28:36.880\n Just because you already have a huge following and a big platform and...\n\n28:36.880 --> 28:38.320\n It's six times the cash.\n\n28:38.320 --> 28:43.720\n If I finish the book in December, I could have it out in February.\n\n28:43.720 --> 28:48.000\n If I finish the book in December with the publisher, it's going to be out in December\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.320\n at the earliest, 2021.\n\n28:50.320 --> 28:52.200\n Why am I giving up 10 months of my life?\n\n28:52.200 --> 28:53.200\n Well, this is the big one.\n\n28:53.200 --> 28:55.080\n Do you have any leverage?\n\n28:55.080 --> 28:58.800\n Like do authors have leverage to say, F you?\n\n28:58.800 --> 29:02.000\n Can you just say, what do you mean?\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:06.360\n Meaning like, I want to release this book in two months.\n\n29:06.360 --> 29:07.360\n Oh no, no.\n\n29:07.360 --> 29:11.000\n I mean, you'll have a contract and then your agent can fight it, but they don't have the\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.680\n capacity to rush things through.\n\n29:13.680 --> 29:14.680\n Yeah.\n\n29:14.680 --> 29:19.720\n I guess if the, cause I've heard like big authors, I don't know, Sam Harris, all those\n\n29:19.720 --> 29:23.720\n folks talk about like, they've accepted it actually.\n\n29:23.720 --> 29:24.720\n They've accepted it.\n\n29:24.720 --> 29:26.000\n They're like, yeah, it takes a long time to...\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.200\n I'm not accepting it.\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:33.800\n But you're kind of implying that a human being like me should, like...\n\n29:33.800 --> 29:35.880\n I'm saying these are your options.\n\n29:35.880 --> 29:36.880\n Right.\n\n29:36.880 --> 29:38.600\n So I just, I just hate it.\n\n29:38.600 --> 29:41.700\n I hate the waiting because it's incompetence.\n\n29:41.700 --> 29:44.640\n It's not the, it's not necessarily the wait.\n\n29:44.640 --> 29:51.640\n If I knew it wasn't, you know, if it was the kind of people that are up at 2 a.m. at night\n\n29:51.640 --> 29:56.960\n on a Friday and they love what you're doing and they're helping create something special.\n\n29:56.960 --> 30:01.800\n That's the sense I get with some of the Netflix folks, for example, that work with people.\n\n30:01.800 --> 30:07.200\n I just, I don't know anything about this world, but you get like Netflix folks who, who help\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:08.680\n with shows.\n\n30:08.680 --> 30:10.840\n You could tell that they're obsessed with those shows.\n\n30:10.840 --> 30:11.840\n Yeah.\n\n30:11.840 --> 30:12.840\n Oh yeah.\n\n30:12.840 --> 30:13.840\n You're not going to get that publishing.\n\n30:13.840 --> 30:17.160\n If you hand, like I handed the book in, I think it was July, I didn't hear anything from\n\n30:17.160 --> 30:19.360\n my editor until December.\n\n30:19.360 --> 30:27.720\n Well, can we actually talk about the suffering, the darkest parts of writing a book?\n\n30:27.720 --> 30:33.800\n So the, let's go to the full Michael Malice, Stephen King mode of what are the darkest\n\n30:33.800 --> 30:38.480\n moments of writing this book and what is it maybe start, the white pill?\n\n30:38.480 --> 30:39.480\n What's the idea?\n\n30:39.480 --> 30:43.320\n What's the hope and what are your darkest moments around writing this book?\n\n30:43.320 --> 30:48.600\n So people are familiar with the red pill and the blue pill, the red, they're from the Matrix.\n\n30:48.600 --> 30:53.940\n The red pill is the idea that what is presented as fact by the corporate press entertainment\n\n30:53.940 --> 30:58.140\n industry is in fact a carefully constructed narrative designed to keep some very unpleasant\n\n30:58.140 --> 31:01.640\n people in power and everyone else under control.\n\n31:01.640 --> 31:06.080\n And I guess one of my expressions is you take one red pill, not the whole bottle because\n\n31:06.080 --> 31:10.520\n at a certain point you think everything's lie and then you're kind of no capacity for\n\n31:10.520 --> 31:11.720\n distinguishing truths.\n\n31:11.720 --> 31:12.960\n You're full of good one liners.\n\n31:12.960 --> 31:13.960\n Well, thank you.\n\n31:13.960 --> 31:14.960\n Yeah.\n\n31:14.960 --> 31:17.160\n I'm full of something that's for sure.\n\n31:17.160 --> 31:26.480\n And what I saw in this space is a lot of these red pill people got very disheartened and\n\n31:26.480 --> 31:27.480\n cynical.\n\n31:27.480 --> 31:33.440\n And one of my big heroes is Albert Camus and he said the worst thing is cynicism.\n\n31:33.440 --> 31:38.840\n And that's something called the black pill, which is the idea that, you know, it's all,\n\n31:38.840 --> 31:41.300\n it's just we're waiting for the end.\n\n31:41.300 --> 31:42.920\n It's hopeless.\n\n31:42.920 --> 31:47.100\n And I don't see it that way at all.\n\n31:47.100 --> 31:51.040\n And I'm like, all right, I have to address this.\n\n31:51.040 --> 31:55.120\n And not just with some kind of cheerleading, everything's going to be great guys.\n\n31:55.120 --> 31:58.880\n Here is why I am positive.\n\n31:58.880 --> 32:03.620\n And not that I'm positive the good guys are going to win, but I'm positive that good guys\n\n32:03.620 --> 32:05.460\n can win.\n\n32:05.460 --> 32:07.040\n And that's all you need.\n\n32:07.040 --> 32:13.400\n Because if your God forbid kid is kidnapped and there's a 10% chance that you can save\n\n32:13.400 --> 32:17.960\n them, you're not going to be like, well, I don't like those odds.\n\n32:17.960 --> 32:19.360\n This is your country.\n\n32:19.360 --> 32:20.400\n This is your values.\n\n32:20.400 --> 32:21.400\n This is your family.\n\n32:21.400 --> 32:24.640\n And I think it's much more than 10%.\n\n32:24.640 --> 32:30.280\n And even if you lose, you will take pride in that you did everything in your power to\n\n32:30.280 --> 32:31.280\n win.\n\n32:31.280 --> 32:32.280\n So.\n\n32:32.280 --> 32:35.080\n Is there a good definition of good guys?\n\n32:35.080 --> 32:36.080\n In the sense that.\n\n32:36.080 --> 32:38.520\n The ones who wear white.\n\n32:38.520 --> 32:40.000\n There's layers to this.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:43.340\n You're like modern day Shakespeare.\n\n32:43.340 --> 32:53.000\n Is there a danger in thinking Adolf Hitler was probably pretty confident that he led\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:54.280\n a group of good guys?\n\n32:54.280 --> 32:58.520\n Listen, if Hitler did anything wrong, why isn't he in jail?\n\n32:58.520 --> 33:01.600\n My Czech friend thought of that joke.\n\n33:01.600 --> 33:08.960\n He actually says in his accent, he goes, if Hitler's so bad, why isn't he in the jail?\n\n33:08.960 --> 33:09.960\n That's a good point.\n\n33:09.960 --> 33:10.960\n He's probably still alive.\n\n33:10.960 --> 33:11.960\n Right?\n\n33:11.960 --> 33:12.960\n And look, yeah.\n\n33:12.960 --> 33:13.960\n Hopefully.\n\n33:13.960 --> 33:14.960\n Oh boy.\n\n33:14.960 --> 33:21.960\n Two of the three people listening to this are very upset right now.\n\n33:21.960 --> 33:22.960\n What were you even talking about?\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:26.160\n Oh, how do you, how do you know the, what is good?\n\n33:26.160 --> 33:32.400\n There's lots of standards of good, but if you're for me to be a good guy is if you want\n\n33:32.400 --> 33:36.920\n to leave the world a little bit better than you found it, that to me is the definition\n\n33:36.920 --> 33:38.600\n of a good guy.\n\n33:38.600 --> 33:43.800\n And I think there are many people that that's not their motivation at all.\n\n33:43.800 --> 33:44.800\n It's about your motivation.\n\n33:44.800 --> 33:50.900\n Well, it's also about if your motivation is at all correlated to reality.\n\n33:50.900 --> 33:52.440\n No one thinks we're the bad guys.\n\n33:52.440 --> 33:53.620\n That's correct.\n\n33:53.620 --> 34:00.600\n But are you taking steps to check your motivations and also take a certain amount of humility\n\n34:00.600 --> 34:05.200\n because if you're going to start interfering with other people's lives, you really better\n\n34:05.200 --> 34:08.560\n be sure you know what you're talking about.\n\n34:08.560 --> 34:15.440\n The control of others, if you do have centralized control or then you kind of, you become a\n\n34:15.440 --> 34:21.620\n leader of a group, you better know, you better do so humbly and cautiously.\n\n34:21.620 --> 34:25.240\n And also have steam valves, right?\n\n34:25.240 --> 34:30.040\n So if in case things go wrong, let's have, I'm sure this is a lot happening with AI,\n\n34:30.040 --> 34:34.120\n whatever work with computers, like, okay, if something goes wrong here, how do we have\n\n34:34.120 --> 34:37.440\n a workaround to make sure it doesn't cause everything to collapse?\n\n34:37.440 --> 34:38.440\n Yeah.\n\n34:38.440 --> 34:39.440\n The going wrong thing.\n\n34:39.440 --> 34:41.960\n I mean, the whole, the feedback mechanism.\n\n34:41.960 --> 34:42.960\n Yeah.\n\n34:42.960 --> 34:50.120\n Like, I wonder if people in Congress think that things are really wrong.\n\n34:50.120 --> 34:51.120\n It's working for them.\n\n34:51.120 --> 34:52.120\n Are you sure?\n\n34:52.120 --> 34:54.760\n No, I'm not sure.\n\n34:54.760 --> 35:02.640\n Because I'd like to believe that the people that at least when they got into politics\n\n35:02.640 --> 35:08.520\n actually wanted, some of it is ego, but some of it is like wanting to be the kind of person\n\n35:08.520 --> 35:10.080\n that builds a better world.\n\n35:10.080 --> 35:11.080\n Sure.\n\n35:11.080 --> 35:12.080\n I also think it's diverse.\n\n35:12.080 --> 35:15.720\n Some of who are going to have different motivations than others.\n\n35:15.720 --> 35:21.760\n But like once you're in the system and trying to build a better world, how do you know that's\n\n35:21.760 --> 35:22.760\n not working?\n\n35:22.760 --> 35:30.200\n Like, how do you take the basic feedback mechanisms and like, and actually productively change?\n\n35:30.200 --> 35:34.200\n I mean, that's what it means to be a good guy is like, hmm, something is wrong here.\n\n35:34.200 --> 35:39.400\n And that's why I like the Elon Musk, like think from first principles, like, wait, wait,\n\n35:39.400 --> 35:40.400\n wait.\n\n35:40.400 --> 35:41.400\n Okay.\n\n35:41.400 --> 35:42.400\n Let's ask the big question.\n\n35:42.400 --> 35:45.200\n Like, can this be, one, is this working at all?\n\n35:45.200 --> 35:48.880\n Like the way we're solving this particular problem of government, is this working at\n\n35:48.880 --> 35:49.880\n all?\n\n35:49.880 --> 35:54.960\n And then like stepping away and saying like, as opposed to modifying this bill or that\n\n35:54.960 --> 36:00.040\n bill or like this little strategy, like increase the tax by this much or decrease the tax by\n\n36:00.040 --> 36:06.000\n this much, like, why do we have a democracy at all?\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:11.200\n Or why do we have any kind of representative democracy?\n\n36:11.200 --> 36:13.320\n Shouldn't it be a pure democracy?\n\n36:13.320 --> 36:20.600\n Or why do we have states, like representation of states and federal government and so on?\n\n36:20.600 --> 36:23.040\n Why do we have this kind of separation of powers?\n\n36:23.040 --> 36:24.040\n Is this different?\n\n36:24.040 --> 36:28.560\n Why don't we have term limits or not like big things?\n\n36:28.560 --> 36:31.400\n Like how do you actually make that happen?\n\n36:31.400 --> 36:33.640\n And is that what it means to be a good guy?\n\n36:33.640 --> 36:39.720\n It's like taking big revolutionary steps as opposed to incremental steps.\n\n36:39.720 --> 36:43.020\n Well, I don't know that you could be a politician to be a good guy, to be honest.\n\n36:43.020 --> 36:47.200\n And let me give you a counter example of someone who you could tell is not being a good guy.\n\n36:47.200 --> 36:50.360\n Joe Biden said he regards the Iraq wars a mistake.\n\n36:50.360 --> 36:51.360\n Okay.\n\n36:51.360 --> 36:53.120\n You and I have made mistakes in our lives, I'm sure.\n\n36:53.120 --> 36:56.860\n None of our mistakes have caused tens of thousands of people to die.\n\n36:56.860 --> 37:08.400\n If I were a chef, let's take it out of politics.\n\n37:08.400 --> 37:13.240\n And in my restaurant, somehow, accidentally, someone ate something and they died.\n\n37:13.240 --> 37:15.880\n A, I would feel horrible.\n\n37:15.880 --> 37:21.000\n But more importantly, I would be like, we need to look through the system and figure\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:24.460\n out how it got to the point where someone lost their life.\n\n37:24.460 --> 37:26.300\n Because that can never happen again.\n\n37:26.300 --> 37:28.920\n And we need to figure out step by step.\n\n37:28.920 --> 37:34.680\n I'm not a gun person, but there's like this checklist of like, if you're holding a gun,\n\n37:34.680 --> 37:35.680\n there's five things to do.\n\n37:35.680 --> 37:40.920\n And if you get too wrong, it's like assume every gun is loaded, only pointed at something\n\n37:40.920 --> 37:42.560\n that you want to kill.\n\n37:42.560 --> 37:44.040\n And there's like three other things.\n\n37:44.040 --> 37:48.140\n And it's like to make sure that nothing goes wrong.\n\n37:48.140 --> 37:55.800\n So if I'm that chef, and I would have to not only feel guilt, but take preventative action\n\n37:55.800 --> 38:00.640\n to make sure this has no possibility of happening again.\n\n38:00.640 --> 38:05.400\n If you look at the staff he's putting in, it's the same warmongers that would have advised\n\n38:05.400 --> 38:09.900\n him to get into the Iraq war on the first time.\n\n38:09.900 --> 38:12.560\n That is to me is not a good guy.\n\n38:12.560 --> 38:17.160\n That to me is someone who does not feel remorse for their responsibility in killing not only\n\n38:17.160 --> 38:22.200\n many Americans, but some of us think that, you know, dead Iraqis isn't necessarily ideal\n\n38:22.200 --> 38:23.200\n either.\n\n38:23.200 --> 38:27.200\n Okay, let's talk a bit about war.\n\n38:27.200 --> 38:29.600\n Maybe you can also correct me on something.\n\n38:29.600 --> 38:37.160\n The first time I found myself into Barack Obama was, I don't know how many years ago\n\n38:37.160 --> 38:44.520\n this was, but when I maybe heard a speech of his about him speaking out against the\n\n38:44.520 --> 38:45.520\n war.\n\n38:45.520 --> 38:46.520\n Yeah.\n\n38:46.520 --> 38:52.680\n And him, I think it's on record saying he was against the war before it was happening.\n\n38:52.680 --> 38:55.600\n But he wasn't in Senate at the time, so it was very easy for him to say this.\n\n38:55.600 --> 38:58.920\n But see, like people say that, people say that.\n\n38:58.920 --> 39:04.080\n People say like it was easy and it was some people say it's like strategically the wise\n\n39:04.080 --> 39:07.480\n thing to do given some kind of calculus, whatever.\n\n39:07.480 --> 39:13.640\n But I, to this day give him, that's the reason I've always given him props in my mind.\n\n39:13.640 --> 39:19.800\n Like this is a man of character, like he makes, I also personally really value great speeches.\n\n39:19.800 --> 39:23.480\n I think speeches are really important for leaders because they inspire the world.\n\n39:23.480 --> 39:29.840\n It's like one of the most best things you can contribute to the world is great, like\n\n39:29.840 --> 39:34.800\n through intellect, mold ideas in a way that's communicable to like a huge number of people.\n\n39:34.800 --> 39:37.920\n Yeah, it's better to persuade than to force in every instance.\n\n39:37.920 --> 39:42.400\n That's where I disagree with Chomsky said, like if you're, Chomsky's whole idea was that\n\n39:42.400 --> 39:48.240\n like if you're really eloquent speaker, that means your ideas aren't that good.\n\n39:48.240 --> 39:49.240\n That's nonsense.\n\n39:49.240 --> 39:50.240\n Yeah.\n\n39:50.240 --> 39:54.800\n So I think that's a way for him to describe like I speak in a very boring way.\n\n39:54.800 --> 39:56.800\n Maybe that's a pitch for this podcast.\n\n39:56.800 --> 40:02.560\n I speak boring so that the ideas are the things you value and it's also useful to go to sleep.\n\n40:02.560 --> 40:09.800\n But that's why I really liked Obama throughout his life and still do.\n\n40:09.800 --> 40:14.360\n But when I first like saw this is for some reason you can disagree, I thought he's a\n\n40:14.360 --> 40:15.360\n man of character.\n\n40:15.360 --> 40:21.720\n It's when most politicians, most people who are trying to calculate and rise in power,\n\n40:21.720 --> 40:25.600\n I think were for the war or too afraid to be against the war.\n\n40:25.600 --> 40:33.320\n That's why I liked Bernie Sanders and that's why I liked like in the early days Obama for\n\n40:33.320 --> 40:37.200\n speaking out against the war and not like in this weird activist way.\n\n40:37.200 --> 40:44.400\n Not weird, but not saying I'm an activist, but like just saying the common sense thing\n\n40:44.400 --> 40:50.160\n and being brave enough to say the common sense thing without like having a big sign and saying\n\n40:50.160 --> 40:55.200\n I'm going to be the antiwar candidate or something like that, but just saying this is not a good\n\n40:55.200 --> 40:56.200\n idea.\n\n40:56.200 --> 40:57.200\n Yeah.\n\n40:57.200 --> 41:01.960\n And I think it's for those of us who are old enough to remember, it's pretty despicable\n\n41:01.960 --> 41:04.400\n what happened with Tulsi in 2020.\n\n41:04.400 --> 41:09.360\n She was the biggest antiwar candidate and she was marginalized within her own party,\n\n41:09.360 --> 41:10.560\n which I guess you can make sense.\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:12.780\n She's just a congresswoman from Hawaii.\n\n41:12.780 --> 41:18.640\n But the corporate press did everything in their power to diminish her and pretend she\n\n41:18.640 --> 41:19.640\n didn't exist.\n\n41:19.640 --> 41:26.200\n And for those of us who remember where 12 years prior, when George W. Bush had the Republican\n\n41:26.200 --> 41:30.060\n National Convention in New York and it was the biggest protest in history and the Iraq\n\n41:30.060 --> 41:37.440\n war led to democratic landslides in 2006 and 2008, to have that completely not part of\n\n41:37.440 --> 41:43.000\n the Democratic Party in 2020 is both shocking and reprehensible.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:54.600\n Hey, Michael, you don't have to say, hey, Michael, you just say knock, knock, okay.\n\n41:54.600 --> 41:57.960\n What did the volcano say to his true love?\n\n41:57.960 --> 41:59.160\n What?\n\n41:59.160 --> 42:05.920\n I love you.\n\n42:05.920 --> 42:09.000\n These jokes are better when you know how to speak English.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:13.480\n It was actually in Russian, I did Google translate, okay.\n\n42:13.480 --> 42:18.520\n Back to your book, In the Suffering, you somehow turned it positive.\n\n42:18.520 --> 42:24.160\n And as one who's wearing, who's the representative of the black pill in this conversation, what\n\n42:24.160 --> 42:25.680\n are some of the darker moments?\n\n42:25.680 --> 42:30.960\n What are some of the hardest challenges of putting together this book, the white pill?\n\n42:30.960 --> 42:32.820\n Content, content, content.\n\n42:32.820 --> 42:41.240\n So if I'm having a page in about Reagan taking on Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential primaries,\n\n42:41.240 --> 42:43.680\n I'm going to have to read like 20.\n\n42:43.680 --> 42:48.600\n So it's the thing like if there'll be some times I'll remember some quote somewhere and\n\n42:48.600 --> 42:53.760\n then I have to spend an hour trying to find it because I want it to be as dense with information\n\n42:53.760 --> 42:54.760\n as possible.\n\n42:54.760 --> 43:01.840\n Like how do you structure the main philosophical ideas you want to convey?\n\n43:01.840 --> 43:03.080\n Is that already planned out?\n\n43:03.080 --> 43:06.700\n No, the book changed entirely from its conception.\n\n43:06.700 --> 43:11.880\n So my buddy Ryan Holiday had a series of books, still does, where he takes the ideas of the\n\n43:11.880 --> 43:16.080\n Stoics and he applies them to contemporary terms.\n\n43:16.080 --> 43:18.820\n He has this whole cottage industry that he's doing very well with.\n\n43:18.820 --> 43:22.760\n And I'd asked him years ago if I could do that with Camus and he's like, sure, go for\n\n43:22.760 --> 43:23.760\n it.\n\n43:23.760 --> 43:27.920\n And I was going to rework Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus.\n\n43:27.920 --> 43:32.920\n And I read it recently, reread it, and this wasn't the book I remembered at all.\n\n43:32.920 --> 43:35.920\n And I'm like, okay, I'm going to write the book that I remembered.\n\n43:35.920 --> 43:41.240\n But the more I was writing it, one of the things I always yell at conservatives about,\n\n43:41.240 --> 43:47.560\n there's a long list, is they don't talk about the great victory of conservatism, which was\n\n43:47.560 --> 43:51.000\n the winning of the Cold War without firing a shot.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.680\n And I said, you can't expect the New York Times to tell this story because the blood\n\n43:53.680 --> 43:55.720\n is on their hands.\n\n43:55.720 --> 44:01.520\n And I'm like, well, Michael, instead of complaining about it, why don't you do it?\n\n44:01.520 --> 44:02.520\n Why don't you talk?\n\n44:02.520 --> 44:06.000\n That is a great example of the good guys winning over the bad guys.\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:11.240\n And that's become, A, the victory is beautiful.\n\n44:11.240 --> 44:13.880\n But also pointing out to people, when people are like, oh, things are worse than they've\n\n44:13.880 --> 44:20.800\n ever been, they don't appreciate how bad things were in the 30s, what Stalin was doing overseas\n\n44:20.800 --> 44:24.960\n and how people in the West were advocating to bring that here.\n\n44:24.960 --> 44:31.080\n So that's kind of pointing out how bad things were and how good they became.\n\n44:31.080 --> 44:37.200\n And you don't have to be a Republican or conservative to be delighted at the collapse of totalitarianism\n\n44:37.200 --> 44:39.220\n and the peaceful liberation of half the world.\n\n44:39.220 --> 44:40.720\n So that's a picture of the good guys winning.\n\n44:40.720 --> 44:41.720\n Oh, yeah.\n\n44:41.720 --> 44:49.520\n Well, how does that connect to Sisyphus and maybe to speak deeper to life and whatever\n\n44:49.520 --> 44:55.480\n the hell this thing is, which is what I remember the myth of Sisyphus being about.\n\n44:55.480 --> 45:02.480\n So where does the threat of Camus sort of lie in the work that you're doing?\n\n45:02.480 --> 45:09.280\n So the myth of Sisyphus, which I had remembered incorrectly, is actually just a five to seven\n\n45:09.280 --> 45:12.800\n page coda to the whole book at the very end.\n\n45:12.800 --> 45:15.380\n You only need to read that little essay called The Myth of Sisyphus.\n\n45:15.380 --> 45:21.620\n The broader work is about Camus's concept of the absurd and the absurd man within literature.\n\n45:21.620 --> 45:24.760\n And it's just like, I don't really care about the character in Dostoevsky and all this other\n\n45:24.760 --> 45:25.760\n stuff that you're talking about.\n\n45:25.760 --> 45:27.360\n It's of no relevance.\n\n45:27.360 --> 45:33.200\n But the myth of Sisyphus, the myth itself, not the book or the essay of his, is this\n\n45:33.200 --> 45:39.880\n Greek character and Sisyphus is forced in hell to roll a rock up a hill for eternity.\n\n45:39.880 --> 45:42.800\n At the very last moment, the rock falls away.\n\n45:42.800 --> 45:48.720\n And Camus's takeaway from the story is that we must imagine Sisyphus happy.\n\n45:48.720 --> 45:54.440\n And there's several interpretations of this, but one is once you accept that you are living\n\n45:54.440 --> 46:02.560\n an absurdist existence, once you own your reality, it loses its bite.\n\n46:02.560 --> 46:06.960\n And you can start with that as your kind of baseline.\n\n46:06.960 --> 46:09.920\n And bite is suffering.\n\n46:09.920 --> 46:11.320\n And hopelessness.\n\n46:11.320 --> 46:19.580\n So I think when people look at how much ridiculousness is happening in America and it's escalating,\n\n46:19.580 --> 46:23.680\n you can either think, oh, all is lost.\n\n46:23.680 --> 46:25.560\n And I think you and I have lived our lives like this.\n\n46:25.560 --> 46:30.460\n You can live life more like a surfer, whereas you're never going to control the ocean.\n\n46:30.460 --> 46:33.500\n But you can sure enjoy that ride and stop.\n\n46:33.500 --> 46:36.920\n If you're trying to control the waves, yeah, you're done.\n\n46:36.920 --> 46:41.460\n But if you're like, all right, I've got my board, I'm going to see where this takes me.\n\n46:41.460 --> 46:44.340\n Surfing from what I understand is a pretty fun activity.\n\n46:44.340 --> 46:48.360\n And also sometimes dangerous, but you'd have to ask Tulsi about that.\n\n46:48.360 --> 46:58.920\n So we were offline talking about Stalin and the evils of the Soviet regime.\n\n46:58.920 --> 47:05.600\n One of the things I mentioned, I watched the movie, Mr. Jones, but it's about the 1930s,\n\n47:05.600 --> 47:13.320\n all the more the, what would you say, the torture of the Ukrainian people by Stalin.\n\n47:13.320 --> 47:18.400\n One interesting thing to me that I'd love to hear your opinion about is the role of\n\n47:18.400 --> 47:25.680\n journalism in all of this and also about 1930s Germany.\n\n47:25.680 --> 47:34.520\n So what's the role of journalists and intellectuals in a time when trouble is brewing.\n\n47:34.520 --> 47:41.760\n But it requires a really sort of brave and deep thinking to understand that trouble is\n\n47:41.760 --> 47:42.760\n brewing.\n\n47:42.760 --> 47:47.760\n Like if you were a journalist or if you were just like an intellectual, a thinker, but\n\n47:47.760 --> 47:56.640\n also a voice in the space of public discourse, what would you do in 1930s about Stalin, about\n\n47:56.640 --> 48:03.520\n how the more, and what would you do about Nazi Germany in 1937, 1938?\n\n48:03.520 --> 48:07.760\n So that's really funny that you asked that because currently how the book is structured,\n\n48:07.760 --> 48:11.080\n it's like books often follow a three act structure, right?\n\n48:11.080 --> 48:17.000\n So act three is the 80s, act one is the 30s, and act two is going to be like, all right,\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.040\n let's suppose you were in the 30s.\n\n48:19.040 --> 48:20.420\n Are you just going to give up?\n\n48:20.420 --> 48:22.520\n Are you just going to be like, well, we're screwed?\n\n48:22.520 --> 48:25.760\n And you'd be right to say things are going to be very bad for a long time.\n\n48:25.760 --> 48:29.680\n Or are you going to be one of those few who are like, we're going to do something about\n\n48:29.680 --> 48:32.320\n this and we're going to go down swinging.\n\n48:32.320 --> 48:37.880\n There are two books I can recommend, which are just masterpieces that are written by\n\n48:37.880 --> 48:41.240\n women that just are historians that are just superb.\n\n48:41.240 --> 48:43.520\n There's a book called Beyond Belief by Deborah Lipschdott.\n\n48:43.520 --> 48:47.880\n She talks about the rise of Nazi Germany as seen through the press.\n\n48:47.880 --> 48:52.080\n And what was amazing, and she does a great job empathizing with the press and understand\n\n48:52.080 --> 48:56.960\n their perspective, is we remember, and Chamberlain gets a bad rap, Neville Chamberlain for kind\n\n48:56.960 --> 49:01.200\n of appeasing Hitler, because not that long ago they had the Great War, they had World\n\n49:01.200 --> 49:06.920\n War I, and they had the carnage that the earth had never seen before.\n\n49:06.920 --> 49:11.120\n And when you had people made out of meat, meeting industrial machines, and plastic surgery\n\n49:11.120 --> 49:14.720\n was invented as a consequence of this, they're coming back mangled and disfigured.\n\n49:14.720 --> 49:16.120\n And for what?\n\n49:16.120 --> 49:20.800\n And this was a world where the Kaiser was the most evil person ever lived.\n\n49:20.800 --> 49:25.740\n And we all had the Western propaganda about the Hun and all the rapes and all this barbarism\n\n49:25.740 --> 49:27.340\n and blah, blah, blah.\n\n49:27.340 --> 49:33.800\n So not that long later, when you're hearing all this propaganda, which was factual, about\n\n49:33.800 --> 49:37.960\n Hitler, it's like, we heard this, we heard this 20 years ago.\n\n49:37.960 --> 49:39.840\n This was all lies.\n\n49:39.840 --> 49:42.160\n Give us a break.\n\n49:42.160 --> 49:47.680\n And she has all the quotes from the different agencies and how they addressed it.\n\n49:47.680 --> 49:49.240\n Plus they had very limited information.\n\n49:49.240 --> 49:53.840\n It's not like Nazi Germany was an open society where reporters can walk around and they were\n\n49:53.840 --> 49:56.800\n under a lot of pressure as well in those areas.\n\n49:56.800 --> 50:02.440\n And Hitler himself was pretty good at, he let some stuff slip, but usually he made it\n\n50:02.440 --> 50:04.680\n seem like he wants peace.\n\n50:04.680 --> 50:05.680\n He wants world peace.\n\n50:05.680 --> 50:06.680\n This was amazing.\n\n50:06.680 --> 50:10.280\n They were making the argument that because all these Jews were being beaten up on the\n\n50:10.280 --> 50:16.520\n street, this proved, this was the hot take of the day, that Hitler was weak because since\n\n50:16.520 --> 50:21.480\n Hitler's a statesman and he can't control these hooligans, that shows his control and\n\n50:21.480 --> 50:24.380\n power is tenuous and this is all going to go away.\n\n50:24.380 --> 50:26.960\n By the way, Hitler thought that too.\n\n50:26.960 --> 50:31.680\n He was kind of afraid of the branchers, whatever, he was afraid of these hooligans a little\n\n50:31.680 --> 50:32.680\n bit.\n\n50:32.680 --> 50:38.020\n They were useful to him, but at a certain point, yeah, they can get in the way.\n\n50:38.020 --> 50:42.160\n That's why he wanted to get control of the military, the army, their regiment.\n\n50:42.160 --> 50:45.240\n If you want to take over the world, you can't do it with hooligans.\n\n50:45.240 --> 50:47.200\n You have to do it with an actual army.\n\n50:47.200 --> 50:52.000\n And then you had Kristallnacht, which was a nationwide pogrom, and then all the news\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:59.240\n agencies universally were like, oh, crap, we got this wrong, and the condemnation was universal.\n\n50:59.240 --> 51:05.520\n So that book traces the West's reaction to what's going on there and including the reaction\n\n51:05.520 --> 51:11.760\n to the insipid Holocaust as people being, you know, what they knew, when did they know.\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:14.740\n There was not ambiguity about people.\n\n51:14.740 --> 51:20.680\n I think there's this myth that she dispels that they didn't know the Holocaust was happening\n\n51:20.680 --> 51:22.080\n or they didn't care.\n\n51:22.080 --> 51:26.080\n They were aware, but they were already at war with Nazi Germany, like what literally\n\n51:26.080 --> 51:31.540\n what else could they do at that point, you know, to rescue all these Jews.\n\n51:31.540 --> 51:33.140\n So that's a superb book.\n\n51:33.140 --> 51:38.600\n And Ann Applebaum, I think the book is called Red Famine, came out fairly recently.\n\n51:38.600 --> 51:41.840\n And she brings the receipts.\n\n51:41.840 --> 51:46.680\n And she's a, you know, this is something I really hate with the binary thinkers, where\n\n51:46.680 --> 51:49.880\n the people think, oh, you know, if you're a Democrat, you're basically a communist,\n\n51:49.880 --> 51:51.240\n they call Joe Biden a Marxist.\n\n51:51.240 --> 51:54.880\n It's just like, you know, she's a hard lefty, she's, you know, has TDS.\n\n51:54.880 --> 51:59.400\n But this book just systemically lays out what Stalin did.\n\n51:59.400 --> 52:01.840\n By the way, I'm triggered by the binary thinkers.\n\n52:01.840 --> 52:07.120\n And for those who don't know, TDS 0011 is a trauma derangement syndrome.\n\n52:07.120 --> 52:08.120\n Yes.\n\n52:08.120 --> 52:12.800\n So they, you know, forced the starvation in this entire population.\n\n52:12.800 --> 52:19.720\n And it's not only that, it's like they knew if you weren't starving by looking at you,\n\n52:19.720 --> 52:21.560\n you were hiding food.\n\n52:21.560 --> 52:26.160\n So they'd come back to your house at night and break your fingers in the door, or take,\n\n52:26.160 --> 52:27.160\n burn down your house.\n\n52:27.160 --> 52:30.480\n And now you're on the street without food because you lied, because this is the people's\n\n52:30.480 --> 52:31.480\n food.\n\n52:31.480 --> 52:32.480\n You're a kulak, you're a landowner.\n\n52:32.480 --> 52:35.960\n And very quickly, a kulak, which meant like peasant landowner, became anyone who had a\n\n52:35.960 --> 52:37.840\n piece of bread.\n\n52:37.840 --> 52:40.720\n And this was systemic and ongoing.\n\n52:40.720 --> 52:45.320\n And many people in the press did not believe it.\n\n52:45.320 --> 52:50.520\n There was a British journalist, I believe, who got out of the train, Ukraine, like one\n\n52:50.520 --> 52:53.640\n town earlier and walked and he described all this.\n\n52:53.640 --> 52:55.840\n And he was mocked and derided.\n\n52:55.840 --> 52:58.280\n And this is just anti Russian propaganda.\n\n52:58.280 --> 53:02.160\n Because at the time, in the 30s, this was socialism had come to fruition.\n\n53:02.160 --> 53:03.560\n This was a noble experiment.\n\n53:03.560 --> 53:08.340\n I'd seen the future and it works, as I think Sidney Webb was the guy who said that.\n\n53:08.340 --> 53:12.080\n And the premise was, let's see what happens.\n\n53:12.080 --> 53:13.800\n We've never tried something like that.\n\n53:13.800 --> 53:18.640\n And they were perfectly happy to have this experiment happen overseas at the price of\n\n53:18.640 --> 53:20.160\n the Russian people.\n\n53:20.160 --> 53:23.520\n Because it's like, you know what, maybe this will be paradise on earth.\n\n53:23.520 --> 53:26.780\n And I address this in my book as well.\n\n53:26.780 --> 53:30.200\n This superb essay, I think, by Eugene Genovese.\n\n53:30.200 --> 53:32.080\n And he talks about the question.\n\n53:32.080 --> 53:34.920\n The question being, what did you know?\n\n53:34.920 --> 53:36.360\n And when did you know it?\n\n53:36.360 --> 53:38.200\n What did you know about the concentration camps?\n\n53:38.200 --> 53:39.200\n What did you know about the starvation?\n\n53:39.200 --> 53:43.640\n What did you know about children being taught at school to turn in their parents for having\n\n53:43.640 --> 53:45.240\n some extra bread?\n\n53:45.240 --> 53:47.600\n And his conclusion is, we all knew.\n\n53:47.600 --> 53:49.840\n And we all knew from the beginning, every bit of it.\n\n53:49.840 --> 53:51.320\n And we didn't care.\n\n53:51.320 --> 53:54.240\n Because we were more interested in promoting this ideology.\n\n53:54.240 --> 54:00.160\n So when people are kind of thinking the worst thing on earth is like Robert E. Lee statue\n\n54:00.160 --> 54:02.640\n being taken down to Washington, DC.\n\n54:02.640 --> 54:09.400\n We were being told, and especially in a much more limited news information world where\n\n54:09.400 --> 54:14.080\n now you have literally anyone can have a Twitter, but how many outlets were there, that this\n\n54:14.080 --> 54:18.260\n is, we're backwards, they're the future, they're scientific.\n\n54:18.260 --> 54:21.560\n We have the vagaries of the market, which led to the Great Depression.\n\n54:21.560 --> 54:26.520\n And when you see what was being put over on the American public at the time, anyone who\n\n54:26.520 --> 54:31.680\n thinks things are as bad now as they've ever been is simply delusional or ignorant.\n\n54:31.680 --> 54:38.300\n Yeah, I would say just as a small aside, that's why reading, as I'm almost done with The Rise\n\n54:38.300 --> 54:47.360\n and Fall of the Third Reich, it's a refreshes the, resets the palette of your understanding\n\n54:47.360 --> 54:54.600\n what is good and evil in the world that I think is really useful now.\n\n54:54.600 --> 55:01.960\n What helps me be really positive and almost naive on Twitter and in the world is by just\n\n55:01.960 --> 55:10.520\n studying history and comparing it to how amazing things are today.\n\n55:10.520 --> 55:18.040\n But in that time, what would you do?\n\n55:18.040 --> 55:21.320\n What does a brave mind do?\n\n55:21.320 --> 55:30.200\n And not just acts of bravery, but how do you be effective in that?\n\n55:30.200 --> 55:31.760\n That's something I often think about.\n\n55:31.760 --> 55:37.400\n It's easy to be an activist in terms of just saying stuff.\n\n55:37.400 --> 55:40.440\n It's hard to be effective at your activism.\n\n55:40.440 --> 55:44.920\n One of the big questions historians have constantly is how did this happen?\n\n55:44.920 --> 55:48.080\n A, to make sure it doesn't happen again, but this is Germany.\n\n55:48.080 --> 55:51.600\n This is not some kind of weirdo cult nation.\n\n55:51.600 --> 55:55.740\n They're very advanced, very in the land of poets and philosophers.\n\n55:55.740 --> 56:00.900\n How did it get to that point that they're just shooting children and everyone's cheering\n\n56:00.900 --> 56:02.640\n for this?\n\n56:02.640 --> 56:04.640\n Specifically on the anti Semitism and the Holocaust.\n\n56:04.640 --> 56:09.240\n But just the totalitarianism, the cult of Hitler and just this whole kind of thing.\n\n56:09.240 --> 56:11.680\n This is starting to drop, but there's two sides.\n\n56:11.680 --> 56:13.200\n I don't know if you want to separate them.\n\n56:13.200 --> 56:18.760\n One is the totalitarianism and the entirety of the Nazi regime.\n\n56:18.760 --> 56:29.400\n And then there's the Holocaust, which is going, I would say, very specifically, as I think\n\n56:29.400 --> 56:34.720\n you're about to describe, is targeting Jews very much so.\n\n56:34.720 --> 56:36.680\n I don't know if you see those as two separate things.\n\n56:36.680 --> 56:38.000\n I think they're very interconnected.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:45.040\n But I think if you look at it, everyone thinks that they'd be the ones putting up Anne Frank.\n\n56:45.040 --> 56:49.320\n But if you look at the numbers, they'd be the ones calling the Stasi on her or whoever\n\n56:49.320 --> 56:53.440\n the people were at the time, and not the Stasi, obviously, and patting themselves on the back\n\n56:53.440 --> 56:54.440\n for it.\n\n56:54.440 --> 56:55.440\n So sorry to pause on that.\n\n56:55.440 --> 56:57.120\n That's a really important thing.\n\n56:57.120 --> 57:05.800\n If you're listening to this, and you were in Germany at the time, you would have likely\n\n57:05.800 --> 57:11.880\n been willing to commit or at least keep a blind eye to the violence against Jews.\n\n57:11.880 --> 57:17.120\n You have to really sit with that idea that you would have been somebody who just sees\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:24.320\n this and is not bothered by it, and also very likely kind of understand this as a necessary\n\n57:24.320 --> 57:26.440\n evil or even a necessary good.\n\n57:26.440 --> 57:27.440\n Yeah.\n\n57:27.440 --> 57:32.860\n And I think people think they would be the abolitionists or marching on Selma.\n\n57:32.860 --> 57:36.400\n The numbers don't add up to that at all.\n\n57:36.400 --> 57:39.080\n And I think the question would be like, what social...\n\n57:39.080 --> 57:42.600\n My friend was on Tinder, my friend Matt, who's a great dude.\n\n57:42.600 --> 57:46.340\n And the question was, what's the most controversial opinion you have?\n\n57:46.340 --> 57:47.520\n This is New York.\n\n57:47.520 --> 57:50.320\n And the girl wrote, I hate Trump.\n\n57:50.320 --> 57:56.320\n And what people perceive themselves as being courageous in saying and doing, and what is\n\n57:56.320 --> 58:01.020\n the actual social costs of you saying or doing this are two very disconnected things.\n\n58:01.020 --> 58:08.360\n And we're also trained by corporate media to have completely vapid, uninteresting, banal\n\n58:08.360 --> 58:12.920\n ideas and yet regard ourselves as revolutionaries.\n\n58:12.920 --> 58:18.380\n There are people who still in New York will take pride because they have a gay friend.\n\n58:18.380 --> 58:21.800\n And it's like, first of all, who cares?\n\n58:21.800 --> 58:25.160\n But second of all, you are not a hero.\n\n58:25.160 --> 58:26.960\n And that person is not your prop, by the way.\n\n58:26.960 --> 58:28.280\n That's another big problem.\n\n58:28.280 --> 58:32.740\n Which is why I'd like to give Richard Wolff a shout out for being an intellectual who\n\n58:32.740 --> 58:34.440\n talks about communism.\n\n58:34.440 --> 58:41.760\n I think it takes kind of a heroic intellectual right now to speak about communism seriously.\n\n58:41.760 --> 58:44.280\n There's difficult waters to tread.\n\n58:44.280 --> 58:45.860\n Is that the expression?\n\n58:45.860 --> 58:47.360\n There's difficult paths to walk.\n\n58:47.360 --> 58:52.000\n I love watching a robot try to use idiom in a language he doesn't even know.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:53.000\n 0011.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:57.440\n I'm quite deeply hurt by the binary comment.\n\n58:57.440 --> 58:58.440\n Are you?\n\n58:58.440 --> 59:03.120\n Your feeling has gone from one to zero.\n\n59:03.120 --> 59:04.120\n What is love?\n\n59:04.120 --> 59:07.240\n My buffers have overflown.\n\n59:07.240 --> 59:14.160\n But there's difficult, I feel like communism is universally seen as a bad thing currently\n\n59:14.160 --> 59:15.720\n in intellectual circles.\n\n59:15.720 --> 59:17.920\n Or actually maybe some people disagree with that.\n\n59:17.920 --> 59:25.400\n People say far left, people are trying to, there's some people who argue the BLM movement\n\n59:25.400 --> 59:28.960\n is some kind of a Marxist.\n\n59:28.960 --> 59:34.560\n I don't really follow the deep logic in that, whatever.\n\n59:34.560 --> 59:37.400\n They said they were formed by Marxism, the founder, co founder.\n\n59:37.400 --> 59:41.680\n But stating that is different than...\n\n59:41.680 --> 59:44.720\n There's Marx the totalitarian, there's also Marx the revolutionary.\n\n59:44.720 --> 59:48.600\n I think they're talking more like we're revolutionaries, we're going to overthrow the status quo.\n\n59:48.600 --> 59:49.600\n Yeah, right.\n\n59:49.600 --> 59:51.720\n But we can have that further discussion.\n\n59:51.720 --> 59:58.840\n But I just don't think they speak deeply about political systems and saying communism is\n\n59:58.840 --> 1:00:01.520\n going to be the righteous system.\n\n1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:03.880\n There's not a deep intellectual discourse is what I mean.\n\n1:00:03.880 --> 1:00:09.800\n But if you were to try to be on stage with the Jordan Peterson, to me the brave thing\n\n1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:13.400\n now, it would be to argue for communism.\n\n1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:15.080\n It'd be interesting to see.\n\n1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:16.900\n Not many people do it.\n\n1:00:16.900 --> 1:00:18.320\n I certainly wouldn't be willing to do it.\n\n1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:19.320\n I don't have enough...\n\n1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:23.280\n I don't, first of all, I don't believe it, but second of all, it's a very difficult argument\n\n1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:27.480\n to make because you will get so much fire, which is why I like Richard Wolff, he's one\n\n1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:33.800\n of the people who is quite rigorously showing that there's some good ideas within the system\n\n1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:42.360\n of communism, specifically saying that attacking more the negative sides of capitalism.\n\n1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:47.840\n Just saying that capitalism potentially is more dangerous than communism.\n\n1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:51.040\n I mean, I disagree with that, but I think it's a...\n\n1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:55.840\n I love how something is like we've got a body count of 60 million, but this everything\n\n1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:59.880\n is potentially, like water can drown everyone on earth.\n\n1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:00.880\n So this is incoherent.\n\n1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:04.960\n Well, I think nuclear weapons are bad, but nuclear energy is good.\n\n1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:05.960\n Sure.\n\n1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:07.660\n Well, nuclear weapons also can be good.\n\n1:01:07.660 --> 1:01:11.320\n You can easily make the argument, which I don't know that I subscribe to, that nuclear\n\n1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:17.520\n weapons prevented boots on the ground war, or it caused them to be much more contained.\n\n1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:21.920\n And they're also quite effective at changing the direction of an asteroid that's about\n\n1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:25.040\n to hit earth, as I've learned from a movie.\n\n1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:26.040\n Armageddon.\n\n1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:34.080\n And they're actually useful as Elon Musk has claimed for prior to colonizing Mars, making\n\n1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:35.360\n it more habitable.\n\n1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:36.360\n Oh, okay.\n\n1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.360\n Got to do something.\n\n1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:46.480\n But yes, but I guess what I'm saying is there's a place for nuance.\n\n1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:53.240\n And there's some topics so hot, like communism, where nuance is very difficult to have.\n\n1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:59.960\n And I feel like with Nazi Germany, it was a similar thing at the time.\n\n1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:03.480\n You want to talk about Jeanette Rankin, who was one of my favorite people.\n\n1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:06.080\n So Jeanette Rankin was the first woman elected to Congress.\n\n1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:12.300\n She was elected before women's suffrage was a constitutional amendment from Montana.\n\n1:02:12.300 --> 1:02:16.720\n She was elected in 1916.\n\n1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:22.260\n She was one of a handful of people to vote against the US going into the Great War, which\n\n1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:23.520\n was the right call at the time.\n\n1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:26.980\n She was a pacifist Republican as well, coincidentally.\n\n1:02:26.980 --> 1:02:32.280\n She lost her seat, ran again in, was it 1940?\n\n1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:38.680\n Got the seat again, and was the only person to vote against getting into World War II.\n\n1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:40.800\n It was not a unanimous choice.\n\n1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:42.480\n Jeanette Rankin was the one person.\n\n1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:46.360\n And she said, you can no more win a war than you can win a hurricane.\n\n1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:50.400\n So she's one of these interesting, and talk about bravery.\n\n1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:55.960\n You're the one vote after Pearl Harbor to say, we're not doing this.\n\n1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.840\n And I mean, the pressure she must have been under at the time is, and of course, many\n\n1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:02.520\n people are not interested in hearing her perspective.\n\n1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:03.520\n She's crazy.\n\n1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:04.520\n She's evil, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:07.480\n It's also funny, someone on my Twitter when I talked about her goes, maybe she had Hitler's\n\n1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:08.480\n sympathies.\n\n1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:12.680\n Like, yeah, Ms. Rankin was a big fan of Hitler.\n\n1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:13.840\n You figured it out, guys.\n\n1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:18.760\n Do you think there's an argument to be made that United States should not have gotten\n\n1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:20.280\n involved in World War II?\n\n1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:21.280\n Oh, easy.\n\n1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:22.280\n An easy argument.\n\n1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:25.160\n The argument, I talk about this in The New Right.\n\n1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:29.920\n So on internet circles, there's something called Godwin's Law, which means the longer\n\n1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:37.680\n an internet conversation goes on, the probability someone gets compared to Hitler becomes one.\n\n1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:42.800\n In certain New Right circles, the longer the conversation goes on, the more likelihood\n\n1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:46.040\n that the argument will become we shouldn't have ended World War II also becomes one.\n\n1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:51.880\n And the argument is, at the very least, stay back, let Hitler and Stalin kill each other\n\n1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:54.840\n off, and then go in and knock off the weaker one.\n\n1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:59.200\n And you're going to be saving, destroying two nightmare systems.\n\n1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:00.720\n And I think that's an easy argument to make.\n\n1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:02.920\n Now, it's hard to pull off after Pearl Harbor.\n\n1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:07.440\n But in terms of strategy, I don't think that's a tough sell.\n\n1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:08.440\n What about after Pearl Harbor?\n\n1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:09.920\n I mean, that's what I'm saying.\n\n1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:11.980\n After Pearl Harbor, how are you going to sell it to the people?\n\n1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:13.600\n The argument is, blah, blah, the Holocaust.\n\n1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.200\n The Holocaust, there's no scenario where that doesn't happen, really, unless you're going\n\n1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:19.640\n in way earlier.\n\n1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:24.000\n But even so, Hitler had said, if the Jews launch another war, we're going to wipe them\n\n1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000\n from the face of the earth.\n\n1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.840\n So the Jews are being held hostage by Hitler as an argument for this.\n\n1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:34.140\n Another thing he did, which was diabolical, is in order to make it that people could not\n\n1:04:34.140 --> 1:04:39.680\n accept Jews as refugees, if they were going to leave Germany, they had to be penniless.\n\n1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:43.200\n So now you have, it's not like they're coming over with money and they can take care of\n\n1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:44.200\n themselves.\n\n1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:45.200\n No, no.\n\n1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:46.200\n They're going to be completely destitute.\n\n1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:47.200\n It makes it harder to accept them, yeah.\n\n1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:50.800\n Millions of destitute people who don't speak the language, it's a tough sell.\n\n1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:58.320\n So speaking of good ones law, what do you make of this condition, Trump derangement\n\n1:04:58.320 --> 1:04:59.320\n syndrome?\n\n1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:00.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:04.980\n And the idea of comparing Trump to Hitler?\n\n1:05:04.980 --> 1:05:06.880\n I think it's despicable.\n\n1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:11.000\n And I'll give you an example, something parallel that I think more people should be regarding\n\n1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:12.320\n as despicable.\n\n1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:19.120\n Earlier in 2020, we were all told that unless we were in Syria immediately, the Kurds were\n\n1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:20.920\n going to be exterminated.\n\n1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:22.620\n They invoke the Holocaust.\n\n1:05:22.620 --> 1:05:24.760\n This is going to be another genocide.\n\n1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:29.740\n And if you're not for this, you're basically forcing another Holocaust.\n\n1:05:29.740 --> 1:05:33.920\n None of the people who use this argument, we didn't go to Syria, the Kurds were exterminated,\n\n1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:39.860\n they just vanished from the news, had any consequences for using this kind of a comparison.\n\n1:05:39.860 --> 1:05:44.720\n So I think it's really kind of fatuous.\n\n1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:49.360\n And I think it's amazing that people think Hitler's the only tyrant who ever lived.\n\n1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:52.340\n Like everyone who's bad is specifically Hitler.\n\n1:05:52.340 --> 1:05:54.540\n You know how you know he's not Hitler?\n\n1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:58.240\n Because you can tweet at him, and no one comes to your house to kill your family.\n\n1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:01.280\n Like that's kind of a big difference.\n\n1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:06.240\n Also there between Trump and many of his critics is that his grandchildren will be raised as\n\n1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:07.240\n Jews.\n\n1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:11.600\n So that's also kind of a, and Deborah Lipschad talks about this a lot.\n\n1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:16.840\n The New York Times at the time, there's another book called Buried by the Times, which talks\n\n1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:19.320\n about the New York Times in the World War II.\n\n1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:25.680\n Because the idea that Jews weren't white was the Hitler idea, the New York Times at the\n\n1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:30.760\n time, Salzburger, wanted to be against this idea.\n\n1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:37.440\n So they specifically downplayed the antisemitism as opposed to the Nazis are being oppressive.\n\n1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:43.360\n So the argument that you can separate Nazism from antisemitism is a historical debate people\n\n1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:44.360\n have.\n\n1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:50.600\n And my perspective is, I think it's, I do not find it convincing that you can separate\n\n1:06:50.600 --> 1:06:51.600\n those two.\n\n1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:54.320\n I think antisemitism was essential to Nazism.\n\n1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:59.680\n I think Nazism and Mussolini's fascism have very big differences.\n\n1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:04.840\n And do you think, do you think antisemitism was fundamental to who Hitler was or was it\n\n1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:05.840\n just that?\n\n1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:12.120\n So this is the interesting thing is like, was it a tool that he saw as being effective?\n\n1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:14.840\n No, he believed it.\n\n1:07:14.840 --> 1:07:17.840\n So why do you see those as intricately connected?\n\n1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:23.600\n Could Hitler have accomplished the same amount or more without the Holocaust?\n\n1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:24.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:28.160\n Because think about how many resources you had to divert at a time where you have Operation\n\n1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:29.520\n Barbarossa with Stalin.\n\n1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:30.780\n So why are they connected?\n\n1:07:30.780 --> 1:07:33.320\n Why are they so connected?\n\n1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:38.320\n Is it because Hitler was insane or was he a bad strategist or what?\n\n1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:40.440\n He was obviously a bad strategist.\n\n1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:42.320\n He had no need to open a second front.\n\n1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:45.420\n His generals, my understanding, told him this is crazy.\n\n1:07:45.420 --> 1:07:48.240\n It didn't work out for him at all.\n\n1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:54.120\n I mean, to draw Russia and her resources into that war, it makes absolutely no sense in\n\n1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:55.120\n retrospect.\n\n1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:58.000\n There's a book about, I forgot what it's called, where it talked about him at that point was\n\n1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.360\n just high all the time on amphetamines and that could have affected his thinking.\n\n1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:03.520\n Yeah, there's a really good book on drugs.\n\n1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:07.080\n I forget what it's called, but yeah, it's a really good one.\n\n1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:15.680\n But it was, I mean, scapegoating is a big part and parcel of the Nazi mythology and\n\n1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:20.280\n this kind of one universal figure to explain this kind of skeleton key.\n\n1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:22.040\n But it could have been the communists.\n\n1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:24.500\n I mean, that could have been the source of the hatred.\n\n1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:28.640\n But the communists didn't get Germany into World War I like he said the Jews did.\n\n1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:36.880\n It seems to me that the atrocity of the Holocaust is the reason we see Hitler as evil.\n\n1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:40.640\n No, the reason we see Hitler as evil is because of World War II propaganda still.\n\n1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:42.000\n Because we don't see Stalin as evil.\n\n1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000\n Right, that's my main point.\n\n1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.440\n We don't see Mao as evil to that extent.\n\n1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:46.440\n I think that...\n\n1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:47.440\n Why?\n\n1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:48.440\n Like why would you say that?\n\n1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:49.440\n You know what?\n\n1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:50.440\n Because...\n\n1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:51.440\n The nature of that propaganda.\n\n1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:54.800\n Because I think a lot of the problem for certain type of mentality is Hitler didn't mass\n\n1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:56.520\n murder equally.\n\n1:08:56.520 --> 1:08:59.380\n So as long as you're killing just one group, it's a problem.\n\n1:08:59.380 --> 1:09:02.040\n But if you're murdering everyone equally, all of a sudden, it's like, what are you going\n\n1:09:02.040 --> 1:09:03.040\n to do?\n\n1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:06.200\n So the fact like you were saying, the Hall of the Moor is not common knowledge.\n\n1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:11.840\n The fact that Mao's 50 million dead are not common knowledge and Richard Nixon can be\n\n1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:14.360\n raising a glass to him in China.\n\n1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:19.080\n These are things that I think the West has not done a good job reconciling.\n\n1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:20.080\n Knock knock.\n\n1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:21.080\n Who's there?\n\n1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:22.080\n Frank.\n\n1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:23.080\n Frank who?\n\n1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:26.560\n Frank, you for being my friend, Michael.\n\n1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:30.640\n And the heart attacks will say, Frank, you for being my friend.\n\n1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:31.640\n This is...\n\n1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:34.640\n You got to do it like this.\n\n1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:35.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:36.640\n Okay.\n\n1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:42.900\n Now back to Hitler.\n\n1:09:42.900 --> 1:09:46.040\n Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?\n\n1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:51.400\n We kind of talked about it a little bit in terms of how to...\n\n1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:54.080\n What is the brave thing to do in the time of Nazi Germany?\n\n1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:59.080\n But do you think, I mean, I'm not even going to ask about Stalin in terms of could Stalin\n\n1:09:59.080 --> 1:10:00.080\n have been stopped?\n\n1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:02.720\n Because probably the answer there is no.\n\n1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:05.440\n But on the Hitler side, could Hitler have been stopped?\n\n1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:09.240\n I think a lot of these things, a lot of luck has to play with it.\n\n1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.780\n He was almost assassinated.\n\n1:10:11.780 --> 1:10:14.880\n If you mean by like the West, it's very hard.\n\n1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:15.880\n I mean, yeah.\n\n1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:17.280\n By the German people too.\n\n1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:24.400\n I mean, like if we're politically speaking, there was a rise to power through the thirties,\n\n1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:28.240\n through the twenties, really, I mean, like can whoever...\n\n1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:29.240\n It's not about Hitler.\n\n1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:37.040\n It's about that kind of way of thinking, that totalitarian control that always leads to\n\n1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:40.160\n trouble at sometimes at a mass scale.\n\n1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.360\n Could that have been stopped in Germany or maybe in the Soviet Union?\n\n1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:48.240\n I think this is one of the best arguments against radicalization in the States, which\n\n1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:55.840\n is how do you engage when you have like 30% of the population who are members of a party,\n\n1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:01.800\n which is dedicated to systemically overthrowing the existing democracy.\n\n1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:09.280\n Stalin gave orders that the communists who had a pretty sizable population, the Reichstag,\n\n1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:14.160\n that their target shouldn't be the Nazis, but the liberals and the social Democrats\n\n1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:16.840\n and they invented the term social fascist for them.\n\n1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:21.880\n So instead of, they're just like jihadis, instead of taking their sights on Nazism,\n\n1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:27.000\n they set their sights on the moderates because they figured the choice between Hitler and\n\n1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.620\n us we're going to win.\n\n1:11:28.620 --> 1:11:33.320\n And this was a huge gamble and they were all killed or had to flee and ones who fled were\n\n1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:36.160\n killed also by Stalin to my understanding.\n\n1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:41.120\n So this is an easy way where he could have been certainly heavily mitigated.\n\n1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:47.240\n What about France and England that it was obvious that Hitler was lying and they wanted\n\n1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:52.520\n peace so bad that they were willing to put up with it even after Czechoslovakia?\n\n1:11:52.520 --> 1:12:03.280\n Like this is the anti pacifist argument, which is like they should have threatened military\n\n1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:04.280\n force more.\n\n1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:08.840\n But then the other anti, the anti anti pacifist argument is if you're going to remember Barack\n\n1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:13.360\n Obama had that, the red line, if you cross this red line in Syria, we're going to go\n\n1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:15.660\n in and Assad or whatever is like, yeah, cool.\n\n1:12:15.660 --> 1:12:18.080\n And he's like, oh, okay, well, sorry.\n\n1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:23.840\n So if you're threatening force, there's the great song lyric, don't show your guns unless\n\n1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:25.800\n you intend to fight, right?\n\n1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:32.400\n So if it's very clear with, with free countries through what's in the press, whether the institutional\n\n1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:35.380\n will is there to follow through on these threats.\n\n1:12:35.380 --> 1:12:42.360\n So I think we have been very hard for Chamberlain to rally the British people to take on Hitler\n\n1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:47.480\n just after the great, I mean, the suffering that Britain's took the great war, they still,\n\n1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.680\n you know, obviously it means so much more to them than does to us in the West.\n\n1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:53.080\n What about what do you make of Churchill then?\n\n1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:56.880\n Like why was Churchill able to rally the British people?\n\n1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:06.200\n Why was he like, do you give much credit to Churchill for being one of the great forces\n\n1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.240\n in stopping Hitler in World War II?\n\n1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:10.560\n I don't think that's really in dispute.\n\n1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:16.000\n I think he was very much regarded as this kind of the right man at the right time.\n\n1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.480\n And I think Chamberlain took a gamble.\n\n1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:24.920\n He, the expression peace in our time was Neville Chamberlain when he signed the appeasement\n\n1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:28.800\n with Hitler and he goes, we now have peace in our time, now go home and get a good night's\n\n1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:29.800\n sleep.\n\n1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:30.800\n That's what he said.\n\n1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:33.880\n Cause he's like, all right, you know, he's going to stop here.\n\n1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:40.400\n And it's not impossible that if you just gave him, like if you gave Saddam Hussein Kuwait,\n\n1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:44.440\n it's not impossible that he's not going to, you know, invade Saudi Arabia next or something\n\n1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:45.440\n like that.\n\n1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:46.440\n Let's see.\n\n1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:47.440\n Okay.\n\n1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:56.080\n The last thing I've read, it's like, of course there's, there's a, it's not impossible, but\n\n1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:03.640\n when you're in the room with Hitler, you should be able to see like man to man, like, like\n\n1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:10.960\n to me, a great leader should be able to see past the facade and see like, like, yes, everything\n\n1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:17.060\n in life is a risk, but it seems like the right risk to take with Hitler, like it's surprising\n\n1:14:17.060 --> 1:14:18.280\n to me.\n\n1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:20.960\n I know there's charisma, but it's surprising to me.\n\n1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:23.280\n People did not see through this facade.\n\n1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:28.860\n I really hate the idea of hindsight and everything being 20, 20, and I think it's a very good\n\n1:14:28.860 --> 1:14:29.860\n idea.\n\n1:14:29.860 --> 1:14:34.400\n Generally, I'm thinking generally not in this specific instance to give our ancestors more\n\n1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:38.560\n credit than they, than, than we tend to give them because people often, here's a great\n\n1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:42.200\n example from another context, which is a lightning rods.\n\n1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:46.820\n People always talk about religious people being stupid and superstitious and they weren't,\n\n1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:51.920\n they often were very well reasoned and example of this is lightning rods, which is every\n\n1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:57.080\n year whatever town, the church was the tallest building and that's the one that always got\n\n1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:59.560\n hit by lightning and got caught on fire.\n\n1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:06.160\n Now what, it's a coincidence that it's always the church, like that makes logical sense\n\n1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:11.400\n that they didn't realize, well, it's because the tallest and therefore that attracts electricity.\n\n1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:15.000\n And in fact, when they invented lighting rods, this is a controversy because it's like, well,\n\n1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:19.400\n how is God going to show his displeasure if now it's striking this lightning rod not burning\n\n1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:20.480\n down the church?\n\n1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:26.980\n So a lot of times things are a lot more coherent than we give them credit for.\n\n1:15:26.980 --> 1:15:32.080\n And again, Chamberlain didn't, he's the head of a parliamentary party.\n\n1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:36.880\n So he does not have the freedom in a sense that a Hitler would to be like, all right,\n\n1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:38.800\n we're doing this again, boys.\n\n1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:40.400\n We don't know what it's like in the room with Hitler.\n\n1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:41.400\n Come on.\n\n1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:43.200\n That's, that's, we really have no idea.\n\n1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:45.200\n But I think you have to think about that, right?\n\n1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:51.920\n Yeah, but you can, I can very easily see him in the room being very calm and charming.\n\n1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:55.960\n And then you think, okay, the guy with the speeches is the act and he's putting on a\n\n1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:59.320\n show for his people and this is the real one.\n\n1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:00.320\n Okay.\n\n1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:02.880\n So let's, let's take somebody as an example.\n\n1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:06.680\n Let's take our mutual friend, Vladimir Putin.\n\n1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:07.680\n Yes.\n\n1:16:07.680 --> 1:16:08.680\n Okay.\n\n1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.680\n I don't know why saying his name makes my voice crack.\n\n1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:13.680\n Because he's scared he can hear you.\n\n1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:14.680\n It's like Beetlejuice.\n\n1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:15.680\n Volodya.\n\n1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:21.760\n So there's a lot of people that...\n\n1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:23.760\n Was he the one who built you?\n\n1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:29.520\n No, that was a, that was a collaboration.\n\n1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:39.680\n It's a double blind engineering effort where I was not told of who my maker was.\n\n1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:42.000\n There's a backstory, but...\n\n1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:43.000\n There's a talking cricket.\n\n1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.000\n Pinocchio.\n\n1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:52.120\n He'll be a real boy someday.\n\n1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:58.040\n I talk about him quite a bit because I find him fascinating.\n\n1:16:58.040 --> 1:17:03.840\n Now there's a, there's a really important line that people say, like, why does Lex admire\n\n1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:04.840\n Putin?\n\n1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:07.240\n I do not admire Putin.\n\n1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:08.840\n I find the man fascinating.\n\n1:17:08.840 --> 1:17:10.680\n I find Hitler fascinating.\n\n1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:17.240\n I find a lot of figures in history fascinating, both good and bad.\n\n1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:23.680\n And the figures, just as you said, that are with us today, like Vladimir Putin, like Donald\n\n1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:28.580\n Trump, like Barack Obama, it's difficult to place them on the spectrum of good and evil\n\n1:17:28.580 --> 1:17:33.460\n because that's only really applies to like when you see the consequences of their action\n\n1:17:33.460 --> 1:17:35.700\n in a historical context.\n\n1:17:35.700 --> 1:17:41.640\n So there's some people who say that Vladimir Putin is evil.\n\n1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:46.760\n And based on our discussion about Hitler, that's something I think about a lot, which\n\n1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:53.640\n is in the room with Putin, and there's also a lot of historical descriptions of what it's\n\n1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:57.240\n like to be in the room with Hitler in the 1930s.\n\n1:17:57.240 --> 1:17:59.000\n There is a lot of charisma.\n\n1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:05.760\n In the same way, I find Putin to be very charismatic in his own way.\n\n1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:16.840\n The humor, the wit, the brilliance, there's a simplicity of the way he thinks that really,\n\n1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:25.640\n if taken at face value, looks like a very intelligent, honest man thinking practically\n\n1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:36.160\n about how to build a better Russia constantly, almost like an executive.\n\n1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:42.520\n He looks like a man who loves his job in a way that Trump, for example, doesn't, meaning\n\n1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:45.720\n like he loves laws and rules and how to...\n\n1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:48.760\n There's no adversarial press, so that's going to help.\n\n1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:49.760\n Yes.\n\n1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:51.920\n And he's popular with his people, that's also going to help enormously.\n\n1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:58.240\n I'm talking about strictly the man, directly the words coming out of his mouth, like all\n\n1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:03.000\n the videos and interviews I watch, I'm based on that, not the press, not the reporting.\n\n1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:10.560\n You can just see that here's a man who's able to display a charisma that's not...\n\n1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:17.160\n Like I can see, that's why I love Joe Rogan, is like you could tell the guy is genuine\n\n1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:18.760\n and is a good person.\n\n1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:23.720\n And you could tell immediately that once you meet Joe, that he's going to be offline, also\n\n1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:24.720\n a good person.\n\n1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:29.240\n You could tell there's signals that we send that are difficult to describe.\n\n1:19:29.240 --> 1:19:37.240\n In the same way, you could tell Putin is like he genuinely loves his job and wants to build\n\n1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:38.240\n a better Russia.\n\n1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:45.120\n There's the argument that he is actually an evil man behind that charisma, or is able\n\n1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:54.680\n to assassinate people, limit free press, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:19:54.680 --> 1:19:57.960\n Like that's...\n\n1:19:57.960 --> 1:19:59.640\n What do we do with that?\n\n1:19:59.640 --> 1:20:06.360\n So what do human beings like journalists or what do other leaders when they're in their\n\n1:20:06.360 --> 1:20:13.640\n room with Putin do with those kinds of notions in deciding how to act in this world and deciding\n\n1:20:13.640 --> 1:20:16.120\n what policy to enact, all those kinds of things?\n\n1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:22.080\n Just like with Hitler, when Chairman is in the room with Hitler, how does he decide how\n\n1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:23.080\n to act?\n\n1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:27.280\n Well, let's go back to my wheelhouse, which is North Korea.\n\n1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:34.280\n So when your entire world is based on being against Trump and everything Trump does is\n\n1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:39.480\n buffoonery or counterproductive, the conclusion of your reporting is going to be pretty much\n\n1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:41.080\n given.\n\n1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:46.960\n I was very hopeful that there would be some positive outlooks or outcomes rather of Trump's\n\n1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:49.840\n meeting with Kim Jong Un.\n\n1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:53.120\n It looked like there was a space for things to go a bit better.\n\n1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:57.320\n I talked about it a lot at the time.\n\n1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:05.940\n And Trump was under no illusions about who he was dealing with.\n\n1:21:05.940 --> 1:21:08.640\n People pretend that, oh, he was kind of naive.\n\n1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:13.040\n He had one of the refugees that had stayed the union, you know, lifting up his crutch.\n\n1:21:13.040 --> 1:21:17.320\n The first thing he sat down and talked to Xi Jinping about in Mar a Laga right after\n\n1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:19.520\n he became inaugurated was North Korea.\n\n1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:24.520\n Barack Obama said that when he sat down Trump in the White House during the transfer of\n\n1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:27.120\n power, he said North Korea is the biggest issue.\n\n1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:33.660\n So I think a good leader, whether or not you consider Trump a good leader, has to be aware\n\n1:21:33.660 --> 1:21:41.680\n of, all right, I'm going to have to have relationships of some kind, even if it's adversarial, with\n\n1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:47.960\n some really evil, evil, horrible people, which Kim Jong Un clearly is.\n\n1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:54.000\n Well, I don't think there's anybody that has a perspective that North Korean Kim Jong\n\n1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:58.600\n Un or ill are not evil, right?\n\n1:21:58.600 --> 1:21:59.780\n Correct.\n\n1:21:59.780 --> 1:22:06.520\n But with, in 1930s Germany, isn't it a little bit more nuanced and difficult?\n\n1:22:06.520 --> 1:22:09.840\n Yeah, because Hitler hasn't done anything yet and he's just a blowhard and he's an anti\n\n1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:12.000\n Semite, sure, but he's...\n\n1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:19.560\n What about like before the war breaks out, like what about the basic actionable anti\n\n1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:22.200\n Semitism when you're like just attacking, hurting?\n\n1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:25.600\n Are you talking about Kristallnacht or are you talking about the Night of Long Knives?\n\n1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:26.600\n Kristallnacht.\n\n1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:28.520\n So it's the Night of the Broken Glass.\n\n1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:32.520\n Yeah, yeah, the Long Knives is when he assassinated a bunch of his people, that was something\n\n1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:33.520\n different.\n\n1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:37.520\n Yeah, so like when you're actually attacking your own citizenry.\n\n1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:46.600\n Yeah, that was universally condemned, Kristallnacht, and that was very shocking, its level of barbarism\n\n1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:47.960\n to the West.\n\n1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:55.880\n Because I think we still want to believe, understandably, that things aren't as bad\n\n1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:57.740\n as they seem.\n\n1:22:57.740 --> 1:22:59.080\n We would rather...\n\n1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:07.440\n This is why the North Korea book I did, Dear Reader, is used in a humorous framework because\n\n1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:09.540\n if you have to look, it's like looking to the sun.\n\n1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:12.640\n If you stared it straight on, it's very hard to do.\n\n1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:18.400\n So you have to kind of look at it obliquely and then you're kind of realizing the enormity\n\n1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:20.840\n of the depravity.\n\n1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:26.320\n And again, pogroms in Russia had been a thing for a very long time.\n\n1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:30.840\n And there's a difference between, okay, we're going to sack these villages and persecute\n\n1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:35.440\n people and we're going to systematically exterminate them.\n\n1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:38.720\n There's still levels of evil and depravity.\n\n1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:45.020\n So you did write the book, Dear Reader, on Kim Jong Il, Dear Reader, the unauthorized\n\n1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:48.440\n autobiography of Kim Jong Il.\n\n1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:51.080\n So that's the previous leader of North Korea.\n\n1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:56.400\n Third one is the un, no creativity on the naming.\n\n1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.920\n Well, no, this is intentional because it's a throwback to the dad.\n\n1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:06.120\n So there's been only three leaders in North Korea.\n\n1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:09.040\n So we've talked about the history of Hitler and Stalin, men like these.\n\n1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:14.480\n I think it's important to understand that the history of those kinds of humans, there's\n\n1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:18.640\n the history of North Korea is not well written about or understood, which is why your book\n\n1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:21.200\n is exceptionally powerful and important.\n\n1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:34.880\n So maybe in a big broad way, can you say who was, who is Kim Jong Il as a man, as a leader,\n\n1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:39.160\n as a historical figure that we should understand and why should we understand them?\n\n1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:44.360\n So I wrote Dear Reader by going to North Korea and getting all their propaganda, which is\n\n1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:47.960\n translated into several languages because the conceit is everyone on earth is interested\n\n1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:51.280\n in them and wants to mirror their ideology.\n\n1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.600\n And he died in 2011 and you wrote the book in 2012.\n\n1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:56.600\n I went there in 2012.\n\n1:24:56.600 --> 1:24:58.720\n I wrote the book, came out in 2014.\n\n1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:04.880\n So Kim Jong Il is, though not an intellect, North Korea's version of Forrest Gump in that\n\n1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:08.920\n when they write their history, whenever something happens, he's there.\n\n1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:13.680\n And by telling his life story, it's in the first person, he's telling the history of\n\n1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:14.680\n North Korea.\n\n1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:19.120\n So I wanted to write the kind of book where in one book, and it's the kind of reading\n\n1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:22.400\n you could do in the beach or the bathroom, you're gonna get the entire history and know\n\n1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:26.680\n everything you need to know about North Korea in one accessible outlet.\n\n1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:31.840\n And it's what people don't appreciate about North Korea, there's several things, how bad\n\n1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:33.580\n it is.\n\n1:25:33.580 --> 1:25:35.400\n And this didn't happen overnight.\n\n1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:41.120\n This was very systemic that what this family did to that country where piece by piece,\n\n1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:46.600\n they did everything in their power to hermetically seal it from the rest of the world, ramp up\n\n1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:50.340\n the oppression, keep any information from coming in.\n\n1:25:50.340 --> 1:26:00.800\n And they're very creative and innovative in their style of manipulation and control.\n\n1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:03.240\n So there is a farcical element.\n\n1:26:03.240 --> 1:26:04.240\n Let me give you an example.\n\n1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:05.840\n So people in the West kind of get it wrong.\n\n1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:09.680\n They talk about, oh, they talk about when Kim Jong Il played golf for the first time,\n\n1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:11.800\n they get 17 holes in one.\n\n1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:17.320\n There's this one story about Kim Jong Il shrinking time.\n\n1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:20.360\n And this is a story, it sounds supernatural, but it's not.\n\n1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:25.360\n So Kim Jong Il is at a conference, the Dear Leader, and someone is giving a talk.\n\n1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:30.360\n And while that person is giving a talk, Kim Jong Il is taking notes and working on his\n\n1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:31.360\n work.\n\n1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:36.280\n And he has an aide who keeps interrupting him with questions and the speaker keeps stopping.\n\n1:26:36.280 --> 1:26:39.840\n And Kim Jong Il says, why are you stopping, goes, I see you're doing these other things.\n\n1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:43.880\n And he goes, no, no, I can do all these things at once, everyone's shocked.\n\n1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:49.880\n And they said, this is why Kim Jong Il looks at time, not like a plane, but like a cube,\n\n1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:51.620\n and he can shrink time.\n\n1:26:51.620 --> 1:26:54.480\n And my friend goes, do they mean multitasking?\n\n1:26:54.480 --> 1:27:00.120\n And yes, Kim Jong Il is the only person in North Korea who's capable of multitasking.\n\n1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:06.360\n So in order to elevate him, they basically make everyone else in North Korea completely\n\n1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:09.520\n incompetent.\n\n1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:15.520\n And that has a purpose because should the leader go away, this country is going to collapse\n\n1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:16.660\n overnight.\n\n1:27:16.660 --> 1:27:22.480\n So they laugh in the West about all these newspapers show him at the factory and he's\n\n1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:25.200\n at the fish hatchery at the paper plant.\n\n1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:29.960\n They say the difference in North Korea is that the leader goes among the people and\n\n1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:31.920\n does what he calls field guidance.\n\n1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:34.440\n So he will go in that farm and be like, this is what you need to do.\n\n1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:37.840\n And he'll go here and he's so smart, he's good at everything.\n\n1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:39.920\n And thanks to him for sharing his wisdom with us.\n\n1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:43.780\n And he's not removed from the people like in every other country.\n\n1:27:43.780 --> 1:27:50.000\n Why does that seem to go wrong with humans, do you think that this kind of the structure\n\n1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:57.280\n where there's this one figure, this authoritarian, this totalitarian structure where there's\n\n1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:00.680\n one figure that's a source of comfort and knowledge?\n\n1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:03.200\n Kim Jong Il is not good at farming.\n\n1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:06.060\n Kim Jong Il is not good at the machinery.\n\n1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:07.720\n It's all a complete lie.\n\n1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:10.000\n Or the things he'll point out will be things that are completely obvious.\n\n1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.960\n So here's another example that they use.\n\n1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:16.680\n In North Korea, they have something called the Tower of the Juche Idea, which is an obelisk,\n\n1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:18.400\n which looks like the Washington Monument.\n\n1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:23.400\n But it's completely different because it's got this like plastic torch at the top.\n\n1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:30.080\n And they talk about in their propaganda how all the architects got together and they said,\n\n1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:35.480\n oh, we should make this the second tallest stone obelisk in the world.\n\n1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:39.280\n And Kim Jong Il says, no, let's make it the tallest.\n\n1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:41.720\n They're like, we never thought of this before.\n\n1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:46.160\n And the way it's presented as if, and like, he's the first person to think of this, like\n\n1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:49.520\n these architects are having a brainstorming session at the Tower of the Juche Idea.\n\n1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:53.760\n They're like, all right, we got to do something innovative to put North Korea on the map.\n\n1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:54.760\n What can we do?\n\n1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:56.560\n How about second biggest?\n\n1:28:56.560 --> 1:28:58.220\n He's going to go for this.\n\n1:28:58.220 --> 1:29:01.120\n And then he's like, make, oh, we never thought of this.\n\n1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:06.740\n It's so, because I present it at face value, people sometimes say the book's a satire.\n\n1:29:06.740 --> 1:29:07.740\n It's not a satire.\n\n1:29:07.740 --> 1:29:09.480\n I downplayed all this stuff.\n\n1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:10.480\n It's a farce.\n\n1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:11.480\n Here's another example.\n\n1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:12.480\n North Korea is very big.\n\n1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:16.240\n And I think Russia is to some extent too, on amusement parks, funfairs, they call them,\n\n1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:21.120\n in the British style, because this is a chance for the people to all get together.\n\n1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:25.960\n And there was this amusement park, it's almost like South Park, Cartman, where there's all\n\n1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:27.960\n these rides.\n\n1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:34.880\n And Kim Jong Il's like, I'm not going to let any elderly or children take these rides until\n\n1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:39.720\n I put myself in danger and ride them myself.\n\n1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:42.800\n And they go, but dear leader, it's drizzling.\n\n1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:48.360\n And he goes, no, I have to make sure these rides are going to be safe for everyone, even\n\n1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:49.360\n during the light rain.\n\n1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:51.280\n They go, well, can we go on these rides with you?\n\n1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:52.280\n No, no, no.\n\n1:29:52.280 --> 1:29:54.400\n I have to be the courageous one.\n\n1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:58.080\n And he's riding all the rides and they're standing there crying at his courage.\n\n1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:00.960\n But that's what's, and you ask all the things in one power.\n\n1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:06.160\n It's like, listen, I'm quite confident that those funfair engineers are in a position\n\n1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:10.160\n to ride Modest Mouse, whatever it's called, by themselves and be like, yeah, okay, this\n\n1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:11.160\n is good for the kids.\n\n1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:17.560\n Although to be fair, some of those amusement parks are pretty rusty and dangerous.\n\n1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:23.680\n That kind of propaganda, I guess what I'm playing a devil's advocate is like, it's comforting\n\n1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:25.680\n and it's useful.\n\n1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:33.040\n But it does seem that that naturally leads to an abuse of power.\n\n1:30:33.040 --> 1:30:34.280\n How can it be used correctly?\n\n1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:40.840\n No one person has the intellect or the mind to understand the entirety of an economy,\n\n1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:42.960\n let alone every individual field of interest.\n\n1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:48.000\n Well, for example, you can have an artificial intelligence system that understands the entirety\n\n1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:49.000\n of it.\n\n1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:50.520\n Your affect just completely changed.\n\n1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:51.520\n The mask slipped.\n\n1:30:51.520 --> 1:30:55.720\n I guess you could have an artificial intelligence system.\n\n1:30:55.720 --> 1:31:03.800\n But the question is, can that, I mean, the human version of that is like, you can hire\n\n1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:05.320\n a lot of experts, right?\n\n1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:07.760\n You can be an extremely good manager.\n\n1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:13.560\n Since everything's dynamic, they're not going to have the data to kind of manage it well.\n\n1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:18.760\n It seems that there's a, like what George Washington allegedly did, it seems like most\n\n1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:21.880\n humans are not able to fire themselves.\n\n1:31:21.880 --> 1:31:26.040\n You're not able to like, ultimately be a check on your own power.\n\n1:31:26.040 --> 1:31:36.600\n But that's not, if I was creating a human, that's not an obvious bug of the system that\n\n1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:43.720\n we would not be able to fire ourselves, to know when we have, I mean, it seems like that's\n\n1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:48.320\n something you have to know always, like that's something I often wonder is like, am I wrong\n\n1:31:48.320 --> 1:31:49.320\n about this?\n\n1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:53.960\n Well, this is what we talked about earlier, what are the safety valves to make sure that,\n\n1:31:53.960 --> 1:31:59.920\n okay, if I am incorrect, or my knowledge is finite, Plato's cave kind of thing, what mechanisms\n\n1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:06.720\n are in place that my mistake or limited information isn't going to have the deleterious consequences?\n\n1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:10.660\n And North Korea does not really have that, and as a result, they had polio in the 90s.\n\n1:32:10.660 --> 1:32:17.880\n So there is a, you write about it straight, but there's a humor to it, because it's an\n\n1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:21.880\n absurdly evil place, I suppose.\n\n1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:28.520\n A bunch of people, I asked, I said that I'm talking to you and a bunch of people ask questions.\n\n1:32:28.520 --> 1:32:33.320\n Oh, I got to hear from the plebs, you asked me before we started recording, I specifically\n\n1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:35.280\n said no, it was my contract.\n\n1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:40.480\n Yeah, and you gave, I gave you all the pink skittles or whatever.\n\n1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:41.480\n But they,\n\n1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:43.520\n So pink skittles, you know, pink.\n\n1:32:43.520 --> 1:32:47.680\n I'm trolling, Michael, let me explain to you how that works.\n\n1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:55.080\n We should go at malice.locals.com and sign up and pay, I think the membership fee is\n\n1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:58.680\n several thousand dollars, it's very, it's not.\n\n1:32:58.680 --> 1:32:59.680\n It's not for the layman.\n\n1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:03.440\n Yeah, but the service is excellent.\n\n1:33:03.440 --> 1:33:04.920\n You get a coat with it.\n\n1:33:04.920 --> 1:33:09.040\n But yeah, I went there, posted a lot of really brilliant people there, people should join\n\n1:33:09.040 --> 1:33:10.560\n that community.\n\n1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:15.720\n If you find Michael interesting, or if you just want to go and say why he's wrong, it's\n\n1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:17.840\n a great place to have that.\n\n1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:21.840\n It's not a good place for that, I assure you.\n\n1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:23.120\n A lot of really kind people.\n\n1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:29.920\n So anyway, there's a bunch of people ask that we should talk about humor.\n\n1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:40.720\n So pretend hypothetically speaking that I'm a robot asking you to explain humor to me.\n\n1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:48.880\n So dear reader, I mean, there's a humor, you so wonderfully dance between serious dark\n\n1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:55.080\n topics and then seriously dark humor.\n\n1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:00.960\n Can you try to, if you were to write like a, I don't know, a Wikipedia article, maybe\n\n1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:05.120\n a book about your philosophy of humor, what do you think is the role of humor in all of\n\n1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:06.120\n this?\n\n1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:07.120\n A joke is like a baby.\n\n1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:10.960\n You can't dissect it and then put it back together and expect it to work.\n\n1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:12.480\n Trust me on this one.\n\n1:34:12.480 --> 1:34:17.280\n Despite no matter how you carve that thing up, it's not going to be working the next\n\n1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:18.280\n day.\n\n1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:22.320\n And you need it to sew those little sneakers with those hands.\n\n1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:26.520\n I don't know that humor is something that is very explainable.\n\n1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:30.640\n People there's something called claptor, where this is like the worst kind of humor where\n\n1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:35.600\n people applaud because they agree with what you're saying, as opposed to laughter.\n\n1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:43.960\n That's the poetry reading and the drag queens do that too, I think because of the nails.\n\n1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:45.720\n You laugh, it's a visceral reaction.\n\n1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:50.800\n When someone on Twitter is insisting, you know, that's not funny, you're not in a position\n\n1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:52.560\n to make that claim.\n\n1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:54.920\n And let's go back to North Korea.\n\n1:34:54.920 --> 1:35:01.000\n I had a refugee I knew and he went to high school here and he was talking to his buddies\n\n1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:06.120\n and they said, hey, remember when we were kids, we had Pokemon and he goes, oh yeah,\n\n1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:09.720\n except instead of Pokemon, I watched my dad starve to death, which is the truth.\n\n1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:15.480\n Now, who are any of us to tell him not to make that joke?\n\n1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:19.880\n I don't know what it's like watching anyone, including my dad, starve to death and my dad's\n\n1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:23.620\n fatty so he's not going hungry anytime soon.\n\n1:35:23.620 --> 1:35:33.800\n So it's very bizarre to me when people feel comfortable precluding others from making\n\n1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:38.400\n jokes, especially, and I think this is a very Jewish thing, like this kind of gallows humor,\n\n1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:44.400\n especially when it's laughing about a personal loss or experience that they've had.\n\n1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:50.080\n Humor is a great way to mitigate pain and suffering.\n\n1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:53.780\n But it's also, I think this is why it's a Jewish thing, it's a black thing.\n\n1:35:53.780 --> 1:35:58.420\n When you are a marginalized community or poorer, it's free.\n\n1:35:58.420 --> 1:36:04.000\n Telling stories, telling jokes or songs, you don't have to have money, but you can have\n\n1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:05.720\n joy and happiness.\n\n1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:10.040\n And I think that's why you find it so much more in kind of lower status communities than\n\n1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:14.320\n you find in like wasps who are notoriously humorless.\n\n1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:19.040\n Which is strange because people pay you a lot of money for the jokes you do, so it's\n\n1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:20.040\n not really free.\n\n1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:22.920\n Yeah, well, nope, they don't have to pay me.\n\n1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:25.840\n It's appreciated but not expected.\n\n1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:31.680\n I find my voice cracking every time I try to make a joke, like I fail miserably at this.\n\n1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:32.680\n Some people...\n\n1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:35.680\n You're still in beta, that's what I thought.\n\n1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:36.680\n Alpha.\n\n1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:37.680\n Sure.\n\n1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:38.680\n Being an alpha is like being a lady.\n\n1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:39.680\n If you have to tell people you are, you aren't.\n\n1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:40.680\n No, I meant alpha version.\n\n1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:41.680\n Oh, okay.\n\n1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:46.680\n I don't know if you're a robot gobbledygook.\n\n1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:49.360\n I'm not going there, okay.\n\n1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:51.360\n Who are you talking to?\n\n1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:52.360\n In my own head.\n\n1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:54.360\n I'm talking to myself in my own head.\n\n1:36:54.360 --> 1:37:03.120\n Okay, speaking of North Korea, some people say that, you know, I've read that comedy\n\n1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:04.120\n is about timing.\n\n1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:06.680\n Well, first of all, do you agree?\n\n1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:07.680\n And second of all...\n\n1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:08.680\n No, I'm serious.\n\n1:37:08.680 --> 1:37:09.680\n It's very much about timing.\n\n1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:10.680\n No, just that you're saying yes.\n\n1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:11.680\n Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:37:11.680 --> 1:37:12.680\n Yeah, it's funny.\n\n1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:13.680\n Okay.\n\n1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:16.200\n Isn't it comedy is tragedy plus timing?\n\n1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:17.760\n This is not the full reference.\n\n1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:18.760\n What is it?\n\n1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:20.680\n The interrupting cow knock knock joke.\n\n1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:22.640\n I'm not going to do it, but...\n\n1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:23.960\n That's not a timing thing.\n\n1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:27.080\n It's more of a repetition and then the twist ending.\n\n1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:28.080\n No, the moo.\n\n1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:29.080\n Oh, the moo.\n\n1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:30.080\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:31.080\n Interrupting cow.\n\n1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:33.080\n You're thinking of the banana one.\n\n1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:37.320\n Anyway, I'm not going there.\n\n1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:38.320\n Yet you're...\n\n1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:39.320\n Who are you talking to?\n\n1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:40.320\n In my own head.\n\n1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:41.320\n Good lord.\n\n1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:42.320\n Are you small wonder?\n\n1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:45.320\n Do you stand sleeping in a wardrobe?\n\n1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:46.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:50.640\n That's so British.\n\n1:37:50.640 --> 1:37:51.640\n But yet you're very...\n\n1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:55.240\n I don't want to stay in a closet because that has connotations.\n\n1:37:55.240 --> 1:37:57.520\n Let's both come out of the closet for a second.\n\n1:37:57.520 --> 1:37:58.520\n I love you.\n\n1:37:58.520 --> 1:37:59.520\n Let's talk about...\n\n1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:00.520\n I love you, Lex.\n\n1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:02.800\n I wasn't saying, I love you, Alex.\n\n1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:04.600\n I was saying, I love you, Lex.\n\n1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:06.160\n Oh, you're talking to me.\n\n1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:07.960\n Yes, through the screen.\n\n1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:11.760\n So you think about me when you're with another man.\n\n1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:13.760\n I watch you when you're sleeping.\n\n1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:19.600\n Okay, so you're really active on Twitter.\n\n1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:31.400\n And somebody else asked on your overly expensive membership site, how do you find humor different\n\n1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:34.800\n in writing on Twitter versus spoken humor?\n\n1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:42.560\n So if humor is about timing, how do you capture the timing and the brilliance of the whatever\n\n1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:45.360\n is underlying humor in the context of Twitter?\n\n1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:54.400\n Like another way to say it is how do you be funny and yet thoughtful on Twitter?\n\n1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:58.900\n So with Twitter, you have to be the first one to the punchline.\n\n1:38:58.900 --> 1:39:03.320\n So when Ron Paul had a stroke, I was immediately being like, he's still the most articulate\n\n1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:04.320\n libertarian.\n\n1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:06.200\n He's doing a great Joe Biden impression right now.\n\n1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:08.840\n All the libertarians got ass mad.\n\n1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:12.640\n So like too soon, or like when someone dies, you're making the jokes about them.\n\n1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:16.040\n It's like, when do you want to make the jokes about someone just died a week later?\n\n1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:17.040\n It doesn't make any sense.\n\n1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:18.960\n Too soon is perfect timing.\n\n1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:25.040\n Or you could say it's not appropriate ever, but too soon does not make sense in this context.\n\n1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:28.660\n So that is something that I enjoy doing.\n\n1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:32.600\n It's also fun ruffling people's feathers, something I enjoy doing.\n\n1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:41.280\n I think spoken versus writing is very different because when you are having good banter with\n\n1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:49.700\n someone, for me as the audience, knowing that it is on the spot really adds an element of\n\n1:39:49.700 --> 1:39:51.880\n humor because then it's like, wow, this is fun.\n\n1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:54.240\n It's like a ping pong match or something.\n\n1:39:54.240 --> 1:40:01.800\n Whereas in writing, you're losing the tone, you're losing the relationship of a dynamic\n\n1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:04.440\n conversation.\n\n1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:07.000\n And a lot of times the joke is just going to be a different type of joke.\n\n1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:15.040\n Well, it's funny, but Twitter, there's a sense, especially your Twitter, that you just thought\n\n1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:17.040\n of that and you just wrote it.\n\n1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:18.040\n Yes.\n\n1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:24.680\n Like there's a feeling like it's literally you talking as opposed to what I imagine is\n\n1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:27.920\n there's some editing or it doesn't look like it.\n\n1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:32.440\n Whoever your editor is should be fired.\n\n1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:34.040\n There's an interesting effect actually.\n\n1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:42.080\n If I want to say something, I don't know, about something that's bothering me about\n\n1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:47.400\n the presidential election or something like that, what is the actual central idea that\n\n1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:48.880\n I'm trying to convey to myself?\n\n1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:56.200\n Like if say I was having a hypothetical conversation with myself in my head, why am I putting my\n\n1:40:56.200 --> 1:40:57.200\n pants back on?\n\n1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:01.480\n I'm more comfortable this way.\n\n1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:09.760\n Promo code MALICE20, sheathunderwear.com, okay.\n\n1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:10.760\n That's sheath...\n\n1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:11.760\n What is it?\n\n1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:12.760\n What's the website?\n\n1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:13.760\n Sheathunderwear.com.\n\n1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:17.540\n Sheathunderwear.com, promo code MALICE20.\n\n1:41:17.540 --> 1:41:20.120\n And I forgot, why is that underwear really nice?\n\n1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:23.440\n Because it has a dual pouch technology to keep your man parts separate.\n\n1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:25.640\n They've also got woman stuff, but I don't know how that works.\n\n1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:27.600\n There's a thing worth going somewhere.\n\n1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.120\n And the material is really refreshing.\n\n1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:30.120\n I mean, it's really...\n\n1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:32.020\n And it makes your ass look good.\n\n1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:35.500\n That's promo code MALICE20.\n\n1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:39.320\n And it's made by a former vet because he was in Iraq.\n\n1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:41.040\n So that's why I like promoting it.\n\n1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:42.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:45.620\n But what I'm writing the tweet, I like to...\n\n1:41:45.620 --> 1:41:50.540\n It forces me to think deeply about the core of the message.\n\n1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:54.160\n But what I found, this really interesting effect, like I don't really do much editing\n\n1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:57.960\n on the tweet, I'll just think and then I'll write it.\n\n1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:05.280\n And then when I post it, like submit, I immediately see the tweet very differently than it was\n\n1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:06.280\n in my mind.\n\n1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:07.280\n Huh.\n\n1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:12.520\n I often delete, I delete, I don't know, some percentage of tweets about two, five seconds\n\n1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:13.520\n after.\n\n1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:14.520\n Wow.\n\n1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:15.520\n I don't know.\n\n1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:16.520\n It's something...\n\n1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.440\n Once you send it, it's why the Gmail send features, undo send feature is really nice.\n\n1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:24.300\n It's like it just changes the way I see the thing.\n\n1:42:24.300 --> 1:42:26.440\n So it's very interesting.\n\n1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:33.000\n But I really love it that you can delete it because when I say stuff out in the wild,\n\n1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:40.840\n like to other humans, like spoken word is like, you can't delete what you just said.\n\n1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:46.480\n And I often regret the things I say, like on the spot, like I shouldn't have said that.\n\n1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:47.480\n Really?\n\n1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:48.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:49.480\n I don't have that.\n\n1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:58.040\n Well, again, whoever your editor is, what is it, Edith Piaf, Jeannine Hicart Han?\n\n1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:01.360\n Wow, your French is as bad as your English.\n\n1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:10.000\n I don't have any tweets I regret because if I sent a tweet that I regretted, I would make\n\n1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:11.160\n amends.\n\n1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:17.880\n I would make it a point if I was needlessly offensive to somebody or hurtful or accidentally,\n\n1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:24.800\n I would make sure to fix it and go out of my way to make sure that person feels vindicated\n\n1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:27.220\n and validated by accepting my apology.\n\n1:43:27.220 --> 1:43:30.000\n That has never happened, had to happen, thankfully.\n\n1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:37.760\n I'm also someone who is not big on taking the bait.\n\n1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:40.900\n Some recently some people have come after me pretty hard.\n\n1:43:40.900 --> 1:43:44.640\n And my perspective is that it's not really about me.\n\n1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:46.840\n It's either I represent something to them.\n\n1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:49.560\n I'm just a jackass with the Twitter.\n\n1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:53.220\n So if you're getting this riled up over me, it's not really about me.\n\n1:43:53.220 --> 1:43:55.560\n Maybe I'm delusional, but that's how I look at it.\n\n1:43:55.560 --> 1:44:01.840\n So if they are trying to provoke me into this kind of heated exchange, I will never do it\n\n1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:03.400\n because I'm not interested in it.\n\n1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:08.360\n And I don't think there's going to be any, like Jeannette Rankin, you can't win.\n\n1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:10.400\n It's just going to be like trying to win a hurricane.\n\n1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:12.120\n There's no hero here.\n\n1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:16.360\n Well, let me ask you about this because somebody also asked that on your overly expensive membership\n\n1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:20.680\n site that like they were saying that they're an academic.\n\n1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:24.440\n They wondered, because I'm an academic, quote unquote, I'm not an academic, but I do still\n\n1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:27.040\n have an affiliation with MIT.\n\n1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:32.600\n The word academic is just dirty, which is a problem that needs to change.\n\n1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:34.480\n Just like the word nerd is dirty.\n\n1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:38.340\n No, academic needs is going to be the next front to open and they're going to be very\n\n1:44:38.340 --> 1:44:39.340\n vilified.\n\n1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:42.060\n We're coming for them and it's going to be very, very ugly.\n\n1:44:42.060 --> 1:44:43.060\n And I cannot wait.\n\n1:44:43.060 --> 1:44:50.880\n No, but there needs to be a place, a different term for people who love research and knowledge.\n\n1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:51.880\n Oh, that's true.\n\n1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:52.880\n That's very fair.\n\n1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:53.880\n No, you're right.\n\n1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:54.880\n 100%.\n\n1:44:54.880 --> 1:44:55.880\n You're right.\n\n1:44:55.880 --> 1:44:59.440\n So like you have to clarify what you mean by academic and right now the word academic\n\n1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:04.560\n means in the intellectual public discourse, it means the enemy.\n\n1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:11.520\n And there's a lot of people that perhaps deserve that targeted vilification, but like a lot\n\n1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:12.520\n that don't.\n\n1:45:12.520 --> 1:45:18.120\n They're just curious people that are just building robots that will one day destroy\n\n1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:19.120\n you.\n\n1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:20.120\n Voice cracks every time I make a joke.\n\n1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:21.120\n You're not consistent.\n\n1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:22.120\n I can't do this.\n\n1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:24.760\n Because you're not making a joke, you're telling the truth.\n\n1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:25.760\n I'm editing.\n\n1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:28.040\n Can I delete that joke?\n\n1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:29.040\n Okay.\n\n1:45:29.040 --> 1:45:31.800\n That's not even a joke.\n\n1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:34.440\n Robots building robots that will one day kill us.\n\n1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:36.880\n Oh, God willing.\n\n1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:37.880\n God willing.\n\n1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:38.880\n Humans are the joke.\n\n1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:39.880\n That's why I'm cracking.\n\n1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:40.880\n My voice is cracking.\n\n1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:45.880\n What was I even fucking saying?\n\n1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:46.880\n Academics.\n\n1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:47.880\n Academics.\n\n1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:48.880\n But why?\n\n1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:49.880\n My local, someone had a question.\n\n1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:50.880\n They're an academic.\n\n1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:51.880\n Right.\n\n1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:52.880\n They're an academic.\n\n1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:59.120\n They're saying like, are you worried that in academia, associating yourself with a sort\n\n1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:06.240\n of somebody who can be misconstrued to have radical ideas, like the two examples they\n\n1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.040\n gave is Michael Malice and Joe Rogan.\n\n1:46:10.040 --> 1:46:11.680\n Does Joe have any radical?\n\n1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:13.400\n I wouldn't consider him radical at all.\n\n1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:15.280\n Well, we can talk about it.\n\n1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:17.240\n But Joe is, I think, a bad example.\n\n1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:20.040\n He's quite centrist to me.\n\n1:46:20.040 --> 1:46:24.200\n Well he could have, for example, like what has Joe been attacked on?\n\n1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:34.520\n It's, for example, on the topic of like transgender athletes in sports, there's what else?\n\n1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:43.840\n I mean, he's been pro Bernie Sanders and pro Trump or like giving Trump a pass.\n\n1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:44.840\n Not anti Trump.\n\n1:46:44.840 --> 1:46:47.320\n Not anti Trump.\n\n1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:48.320\n What else?\n\n1:46:48.320 --> 1:46:52.180\n None of these are radical.\n\n1:46:52.180 --> 1:46:56.560\n Meat stuff, being pro meat versus anti vegan.\n\n1:46:56.560 --> 1:46:57.560\n All those kinds of things.\n\n1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:02.800\n But you can be misconstrued and saying, there's I think a highlight, my mom actually wrote\n\n1:47:02.800 --> 1:47:04.800\n to me about this, which is hilarious.\n\n1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:05.800\n Thank you.\n\n1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:08.800\n I said, I like how you jot it down.\n\n1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:09.800\n That's when it's important.\n\n1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:16.680\n That's a sign, my voice cracks, a sign when Michael Malice makes a funny joke when you\n\n1:47:16.680 --> 1:47:23.120\n jot something down.\n\n1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:27.240\n He writes it and then the next time he crosses it out.\n\n1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:28.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:31.800\n It's like Joe Biden and the debates.\n\n1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:36.680\n I did also just crap my pants.\n\n1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:42.520\n So there's a, I mean, he's a comedian.\n\n1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:44.560\n You have a comedian side to you, right?\n\n1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:48.920\n I mean, you're, you've talked humorous side humorous.\n\n1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:53.120\n So you can misconstrued like Joe is being somehow a radical thinker and the same can\n\n1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:54.720\n be done with you.\n\n1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:59.600\n And his question was, how are you worried about associating yourself with folks like\n\n1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:00.600\n that?\n\n1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:01.600\n Am I or are you?\n\n1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:02.600\n Like me?\n\n1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:03.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:04.600\n That's a good question.\n\n1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:12.880\n And is that something, do you see yourself as somebody who's dangerous that I shouldn't\n\n1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:14.440\n be talking to?\n\n1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:23.600\n And in the same way, do you ever think about guests on your podcast or people you talk\n\n1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:30.280\n to publicly, associate yourself with publicly and think that there is somebody that crosses\n\n1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:32.040\n that line that you shouldn't talk to?\n\n1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:37.440\n So I interviewed in the new ride, I interviewed like up to full blown Nazis in the last chapter\n\n1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:40.940\n is that Chris Cantwell, but that was in the context of that book, right?\n\n1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:45.800\n So there's lots of people who people want me to have on my show.\n\n1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:48.560\n And the way I look at it is like you have a table and tablecloth, right?\n\n1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:52.140\n And let's suppose the table is three feet wide.\n\n1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:54.600\n The tablecloth is two feet wide.\n\n1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:58.280\n So if I move the tablecloth to the right, I'm going to lose people on the left.\n\n1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:00.240\n I can only cover so much space.\n\n1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:04.100\n And the further you go on the fringe in one direction, the more mainstream you're going\n\n1:49:04.100 --> 1:49:05.800\n to lose on the other direction.\n\n1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:12.000\n So I'm very much making a conscious choice not to talk to being, people will say I'm\n\n1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:13.720\n cowardly and that's absolutely true.\n\n1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:15.160\n I'm being fearful here.\n\n1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:22.080\n I would prefer not to talk to some of those who would alienate some of the more mainstream\n\n1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:23.080\n people.\n\n1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:25.300\n And here's a perfect example of why.\n\n1:49:25.300 --> 1:49:29.160\n On my birthday last year, I woke up seven o clock in the morning to go pee.\n\n1:49:29.160 --> 1:49:34.600\n And I checked Twitter or whatever, and Jeb Bush had followed me, Jeb.\n\n1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:37.920\n And it's seven a.m., you're not really awake.\n\n1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:38.920\n You're like, wait, what?\n\n1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:41.200\n And then I thought maybe it was a fake account, but it's in the verified tab.\n\n1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:44.240\n Oh, you don't have this because you're not verified on Twitter, that's a shame.\n\n1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:45.800\n So people who are mad are on Twitter.\n\n1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:49.680\n Twitter does not respect robots.\n\n1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:50.680\n They ban bots.\n\n1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:51.680\n You're lucky.\n\n1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:52.680\n Zero, one.\n\n1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:53.680\n Zero, zero.\n\n1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:56.080\n It's zero, zero, zero.\n\n1:49:56.080 --> 1:49:57.080\n Those are my pronouns.\n\n1:49:57.080 --> 1:50:07.160\n So it was Jeb, Jeb, Governor Bush, and I corresponded with him and I asked him on the show and he\n\n1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:09.480\n decided not to for various reasons.\n\n1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:12.240\n Very politely, he's like, just politics is so bad right now, I don't want to talk about\n\n1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:13.240\n it.\n\n1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:14.760\n And I respect that for him.\n\n1:50:14.760 --> 1:50:24.400\n If I'm creating my show where he's going to get heat and get canceled, oh, you can't be\n\n1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:25.400\n on the show.\n\n1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:26.400\n He has these other guests.\n\n1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:29.840\n I don't want to lose that opportunity because as we were talking about earlier, me and Alex\n\n1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:35.320\n Jones and Tim Pool, I think a lot of people would be very excited to see me sit down with\n\n1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:36.320\n Jeb Bush.\n\n1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:40.040\n And I told him in writing, and I meant this, I wouldn't be clowning him.\n\n1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:41.820\n I wouldn't be disrespectful.\n\n1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:43.280\n It would be a lot of fun.\n\n1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:46.600\n There's a goofball side to him that comes out sometimes and I would do my best to bring\n\n1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:50.680\n that out and talk about what it's like being a blue blood to be born into his grandfather,\n\n1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:55.860\n Prescott Bush was a Senator from Connecticut, marrying a woman who didn't speak English.\n\n1:50:55.860 --> 1:50:58.160\n How does that work when your family's royalty and things like that?\n\n1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:01.320\n So I had a lot of fun questions for him and that's kind of, you're going to have to choose\n\n1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:02.320\n one or the other.\n\n1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:04.440\n Well, you do a really good job with that.\n\n1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:09.600\n Like Ben Shapiro does a good job with that too, which is you can have multiple, you can\n\n1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:14.800\n have a trolley side, humor side where you tear down the power structures and so on,\n\n1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:19.080\n but you can also have a serious side and it's a safe space for people from all walks of\n\n1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:22.640\n life to walk in and you're not adversarial.\n\n1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:23.640\n Never.\n\n1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:25.980\n So I take the word guests seriously.\n\n1:51:25.980 --> 1:51:30.720\n If they're going to be on my show, I'm not going to have them have negative consequences\n\n1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:32.840\n as a result of being on my show.\n\n1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:41.960\n That said, I mean, maybe in my case, I'll be honest and say that I find Alex Jones outside\n\n1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:46.000\n of the conspiracy stuff for some reason, maybe you can explain, maybe you can psychoanalyze\n\n1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:49.320\n me, but I find him hilarious to listen to.\n\n1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:50.320\n He's a performer.\n\n1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:51.640\n He's very performative.\n\n1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:56.600\n But there's a lot of people that don't see the humor of it and they see the serious consequences\n\n1:51:56.600 --> 1:52:05.920\n of spreading conspiracy theories of different kinds and they see the danger of it.\n\n1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:15.520\n And I personally, I'm often tempted to talk to Alex in a podcast format, but I think I'm\n\n1:52:15.520 --> 1:52:19.060\n trying to convince myself that I never will.\n\n1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:28.040\n For me, I feel unsafe talking to Alex because I can't truly be myself, which is like naive\n\n1:52:28.040 --> 1:52:30.400\n and honest.\n\n1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:37.480\n And actually, I generally, when I talk to humans, I want to see the best in them.\n\n1:52:37.480 --> 1:52:42.600\n And I think that's like, I often think about if I talked to Hitler in 1935, 1938.\n\n1:52:42.600 --> 1:52:46.680\n You got a list of names to give him.\n\n1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:50.200\n Well, yeah, I mean, that's how you get the interview.\n\n1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:53.440\n Come on, let's be honest.\n\n1:52:53.440 --> 1:52:54.440\n Who are we kidding?\n\n1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:59.960\n I would, you have to give away one of your, I would probably give away one of my brothers,\n\n1:52:59.960 --> 1:53:00.960\n so.\n\n1:53:00.960 --> 1:53:01.960\n How many brothers do you have?\n\n1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:02.960\n Well, just one.\n\n1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:03.960\n Okay.\n\n1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:04.960\n Too many.\n\n1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:07.000\n I want to be an only child.\n\n1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.000\n He's the older brother.\n\n1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:09.000\n He used to pick on me.\n\n1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000\n Payback.\n\n1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:11.360\n You know, it's only, he had a good life.\n\n1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:14.400\n You should think of it more as Stalin, so I don't interrupt you, because Hitler, you're\n\n1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:15.400\n Jewish.\n\n1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:20.480\n You're already going to have very adversarial, he's not going to perceive you as a human\n\n1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:21.480\n in a sense, right?\n\n1:53:21.480 --> 1:53:22.480\n Right.\n\n1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:23.480\n Stalin, you're right.\n\n1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:24.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:25.480\n That would be much easier.\n\n1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:26.480\n Or Kim Jong Un or something like that.\n\n1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:27.480\n Okay.\n\n1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:32.280\n Do you think, like how, okay, this is a good question, is, and that's, why don't you judge\n\n1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:33.280\n something?\n\n1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:44.320\n If you, alright, we'll cross it out in a second.\n\n1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:49.160\n I think this is a really good example of a difficult figure that's controversial that\n\n1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.760\n people bring up to me a lot, and you've interviewed twice, which is Curtis Yarvin.\n\n1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:54.760\n Yeah, Manchester Smallbug.\n\n1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:59.680\n Manchester Small, AKA Manchester Smallbug, which is his pseudonym that he goes by in\n\n1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:00.680\n his blog.\n\n1:54:00.680 --> 1:54:03.400\n Can you tell me about who he is?\n\n1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:04.400\n Sure.\n\n1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:05.400\n Why is he interesting?\n\n1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:06.880\n What of his ideas are interesting?\n\n1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:10.360\n Well, briefly, he invented the concept, the red pill.\n\n1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:15.320\n So Curtis, Manchester Smallbug had a blog called Unqualified Reservations, you can still\n\n1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:16.320\n find it online.\n\n1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:18.120\n It's very verbose.\n\n1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:22.680\n He writes at length, very, very bright.\n\n1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:26.100\n His perspective is very heretical.\n\n1:54:26.100 --> 1:54:31.960\n So a lot of things that we take for granted in our liberal democracy, he regards as not\n\n1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:38.120\n only incorrect, which is downright absurd, and he does not take what many people view\n\n1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:44.640\n as the basis of American political discourse as the basis for his thought.\n\n1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:55.520\n So when you're starting with someone who is basically repudiating the American milieu,\n\n1:54:55.520 --> 1:55:02.740\n a lot of people are going to, of course, regard him as dangerous or someone who is verboten.\n\n1:55:02.740 --> 1:55:05.840\n He's a very bright person.\n\n1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:08.400\n Why is he such a toxic figure?\n\n1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:17.200\n Because if you are blue pilled, if you are the guardians of what is acceptable discourse,\n\n1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:22.480\n then you have to make sure your forts are secured, and that any figure outside of this\n\n1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:28.440\n acceptable discourse has to be marginalized and regarded as radioactive as possible.\n\n1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:34.760\n You don't want to let in these kind of ideas that would be destructive to your hegemony.\n\n1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:36.600\n So let's dig into it.\n\n1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:44.240\n So I've read a few things by him, but then I hear that in a bunch of places, him being\n\n1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:49.560\n called a racist, a white supremacist, neo fascist, so on.\n\n1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:52.600\n I go to his Wikipedia.\n\n1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:54.560\n There's a view on race section.\n\n1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:57.440\n Let me read it.\n\n1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:02.520\n Yarvin's opinions have been described as racist, with his writings interpreted as supportive\n\n1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:08.640\n of slavery, including the belief that whites have higher IQs than blacks for genetic reasons.\n\n1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:14.320\n Yarvin himself maintains that he's not a racist because while he doubts that, quote,\n\n1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:19.920\n all races are equally smart, the notion, quote, that people who score higher on IQ tests are\n\n1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:24.040\n in some sense superior human beings is, quote, creepy.\n\n1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:29.920\n He also disputes being an outspoken advocate for slavery, though he has argued that some\n\n1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:34.920\n races are more suited for slavery than others, quote, it should be obvious that although\n\n1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:40.560\n I'm not a white nationalist, I am not exactly allergic to the stuff.\n\n1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:45.960\n Yarvin wrote in a post that linked approvingly of, I don't know these people, Steve Saylor.\n\n1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:46.960\n Steve Saylor, yeah, he's from.\n\n1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:49.360\n Jared Taylor and other racialists.\n\n1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:50.360\n Yeah, so.\n\n1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:54.400\n Okay, so like, one of my questions is.\n\n1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:56.680\n Let me just say one sentence.\n\n1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:01.040\n In the same way that you had, you mentioned that guy earlier who was defending some aspects\n\n1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:06.280\n of communism, and that is, in some context, acceptable when you think about it, it's like\n\n1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:08.560\n this should be radioactive.\n\n1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:14.240\n The fact that he is engaging with these ideas in anything other than this has to be reputed\n\n1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:18.400\n at all costs is what renders him to a large extent a racist.\n\n1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:19.400\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:26.040\n There are some topics you can be nuanced and some not, and communism is still a topic that\n\n1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:28.080\n you can be nuanced about.\n\n1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:31.600\n It's difficult, but you can be.\n\n1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:38.720\n Race and this like talking about slavery and IQ differences based on race is a topic that\n\n1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:45.480\n I guess is radioactive to a degree where you can't even say anything, even if it's like\n\n1:57:45.480 --> 1:57:52.120\n nuanced or not even like making a point, it's like touching it as you make another point.\n\n1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:56.880\n And understandably, you can understand that I'm going to steel man their point, because\n\n1:57:56.880 --> 1:57:57.880\n you can understand the point.\n\n1:57:57.880 --> 1:57:59.680\n It's like you're just talking about Hitler.\n\n1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:04.520\n Once this foot gets in the door that some people are inherently slaves or some people\n\n1:58:04.520 --> 1:58:09.120\n are inherently better than others, it really quickly collapses, so that would be their\n\n1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:10.120\n perspective.\n\n1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:12.680\n But that's what, like if I were to give criticism of his...\n\n1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:14.400\n But let me just say one more thing.\n\n1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:17.080\n Racist is also used to describe Alex Jones.\n\n1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:19.280\n Alex doesn't talk about race.\n\n1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:25.240\n Racist is a shorthand for a certain percentage of the population to let you know, do not\n\n1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:28.160\n bother investing in this person any further.\n\n1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:29.160\n They're off limits.\n\n1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:30.240\n Yeah, so definitely.\n\n1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:34.880\n Racism and sexism is a thing that's now used to shut down conversation that's quite absurd\n\n1:58:34.880 --> 1:58:36.400\n by a small percent of the population.\n\n1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:41.640\n But Jared Taylor and Steve Saylor, Jared Taylor interviewed him for my book, he would be regarded\n\n1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:43.400\n in any sense as a racist.\n\n1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:45.680\n What's the difference between racist and racialists?\n\n1:58:45.680 --> 1:58:50.680\n So racialists, I mean, this is splitting hairs and now I'm gonna be all radioactive, Jared\n\n1:58:50.680 --> 1:58:55.240\n Taylor runs something called Amarin and this is, I mean, his perspective is that there\n\n1:58:55.240 --> 1:59:01.240\n are inherent differences for the races and you cannot live side by side, well, whites\n\n1:59:01.240 --> 1:59:03.000\n and blacks should not be living side by side.\n\n1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:07.680\n And by the way, for people who don't know, this is out of context, you have written a\n\n1:59:07.680 --> 1:59:11.800\n great book that includes some of these concepts called The New Right, which does not include\n\n1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:20.440\n these concepts, but talks about, well, it's more about the growth of the community around\n\n1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:23.360\n the alt right and all those kinds of the world.\n\n1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:29.560\n So and his point about IQ, it's like, if you had a population, the Dutch, right, I think\n\n1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:31.560\n they're the tallest people on earth.\n\n1:59:31.560 --> 1:59:35.160\n And if you said, well, the Dutch are the best people on earth, why?\n\n1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:38.080\n Because they're the tallest, it's like you're a crazy person.\n\n1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:43.040\n So if someone is scoring low, an individual on an IQ test, that means they're somehow\n\n1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:44.400\n a lower quality person.\n\n1:59:44.400 --> 1:59:48.720\n Well, maybe one very specific aspect, but I mean, if they're a good human being, I've\n\n1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:52.160\n got friends who are low IQ, all my friends are low IQ, frankly, compared to me, sound\n\n1:59:52.160 --> 1:59:53.160\n like Trump there for a second.\n\n1:59:53.160 --> 1:59:54.160\n That's how you choose.\n\n1:59:54.160 --> 1:59:58.280\n Well, I don't have any other choices, no one's gonna be at my level.\n\n1:59:58.280 --> 2:00:02.120\n You're the smartest person since Abraham Lincoln that I've ever seen.\n\n2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:05.400\n Unlike him, I actually am honest.\n\n2:00:05.400 --> 2:00:11.920\n So he is someone who very much swims in heretical ideas.\n\n2:00:11.920 --> 2:00:16.240\n Here's another thing, like if you bring up that Aristotle said that some people are born\n\n2:00:16.240 --> 2:00:20.080\n to be slaves, he wasn't speaking about race, he just meant people's souls.\n\n2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:21.080\n H.L.\n\n2:00:21.080 --> 2:00:27.640\n Mencken, who's a great heretic and early 20th century figure, one of his quotes that I say\n\n2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:31.320\n all the time, which people have seen a lot in this past year, that the average man does\n\n2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:34.440\n not want to be free, he merely wants to be safe.\n\n2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:39.920\n That I think speaks, I don't know, I am not familiar with what Mulbug's saying about slavery\n\n2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:45.120\n because his writing is ponderous, but that certainly is something I think that is undeniable,\n\n2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:48.560\n that I think more people are realizing there's a large percent of the population that is\n\n2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:52.280\n actively disinterested in freedom and the more responsibilities it entails.\n\n2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:57.800\n Well, I mean, really just the word slavery, if you want to make some kind of point or\n\n2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:03.760\n even think about the topic outside the context of this is a horrible thing that happened\n\n2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:05.320\n in the United States history.\n\n2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:07.560\n And other countries history is not unique to us, let's be clear.\n\n2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:13.280\n This is very important in their slavery going on today and a lot of people argue that sex\n\n2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:17.160\n trafficking and all those kinds of things, I mean, there's atrocities going on today\n\n2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:25.400\n that talking about it in a way that's not immediately saying this is the most horrible\n\n2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:32.720\n thing that happened ever, it's something I think about a lot is like if I want to say\n\n2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:39.920\n something controversial, I should do so with skill, with care, and only about things I\n\n2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:40.920\n care about.\n\n2:01:40.920 --> 2:01:43.400\n Well, here's where I would disagree.\n\n2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:48.360\n When I say things, I often say things that are controversial, or I will say uncontroversial\n\n2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:53.480\n things in a controversial way, because it's a useful mechanism to alienate people you\n\n2:01:53.480 --> 2:01:55.240\n don't want around you.\n\n2:01:55.240 --> 2:02:00.360\n Because if there are people who are going to be shocked by certain topics, like we should\n\n2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:04.280\n have ended World War II, like even as a hypothesis, they just clutch their pearls, they're like,\n\n2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:06.280\n oh, you want the Holocaust to happen?\n\n2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:10.720\n I can't discuss most things with you because you're not interested in having a conversation,\n\n2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:12.040\n you're interested in your emotional response.\n\n2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:16.880\n I see things differently, maybe this is a bit of a devil's advocate, but in at least\n\n2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:22.940\n the modern discourse of like Twitter and social media and so on, I find that if you do that,\n\n2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:29.560\n you're not actually removing the people that are not thoughtful and kind and so on, you're\n\n2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:31.920\n actually attracting loud people.\n\n2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:36.800\n Like a small number of them, they come over and start yelling at you, start yelling, they're\n\n2:02:36.800 --> 2:02:43.080\n basically ruin the party by showing up and just screaming, and so all the thoughtful\n\n2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:44.080\n people leave.\n\n2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:46.960\n Well, that's why you have to be a very heavy blocker.\n\n2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:50.240\n You have to block people on Twitter because you have to cultivate your audience and have\n\n2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:54.040\n them, like a lot of times people come at me, I don't care, then they'll start attacking\n\n2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:56.880\n members of my audience and then I'm like, dang, I got to block them because they've won\n\n2:02:56.880 --> 2:02:59.880\n this one because I can't have that.\n\n2:02:59.880 --> 2:03:12.840\n Yeah, I don't know, unnecessarily provoking people feels, this is beta testing, you try\n\n2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:17.360\n to break the system and see what works, you put up as much pressure as possible.\n\n2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:21.440\n This is very much computer stuff that you should be able to appreciate, the point being\n\n2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:25.920\n when you have a program, you're trying to intentionally sit there and do as many mistakes\n\n2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:26.920\n as you would go wrong.\n\n2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:27.920\n Right?\n\n2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:28.920\n Is that not common practice?\n\n2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:29.920\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:37.400\n So you're saying that's a way to see communication with the world, as you say something uncontroversial\n\n2:03:37.400 --> 2:03:40.880\n in a controversial way and that blocks people.\n\n2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:41.880\n Or does it trigger them?\n\n2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:42.880\n Do they roll their eyes?\n\n2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:44.920\n What is going to be their emotional response?\n\n2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:47.040\n Are they going to start yelling?\n\n2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:52.960\n The problem is the reason I can't think like this, or I can't, because I'm not sure about\n\n2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:56.600\n the points I'm trying to make, always.\n\n2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:59.200\n I'm not always 100% sure that I'm right about things.\n\n2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:08.680\n So in being thoughtful, I'm afraid that I'll turn off with an eloquently phrased or even\n\n2:04:08.680 --> 2:04:15.760\n incorrect statement, I will do damage that can't be undone in terms of having a good\n\n2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:17.400\n conversation about a topic.\n\n2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:24.280\n So I want to be very careful about like, I'm not saying afraid, fear is not what I'm talking\n\n2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:25.280\n about.\n\n2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:31.360\n I think fear is like not saying something out of fear is at the core of the many of\n\n2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:33.320\n the problems of the world today.\n\n2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:36.080\n But I'm just saying be, say stuff with care.\n\n2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:43.960\n If I'm going to touch race as a topic, it feels like you really should be deeply, first\n\n2:04:43.960 --> 2:04:49.240\n have a point to make, like you really care about a point you want to make, and second,\n\n2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:54.840\n think deeply about how to say that point in a way that communicates it the best.\n\n2:04:54.840 --> 2:05:04.560\n And touching, I would say, listen, on your show, which is great, I mean, I'd like to\n\n2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:07.340\n say thank you for having Menchus Moberg.\n\n2:05:07.340 --> 2:05:09.440\n You are welcome.\n\n2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:13.920\n That's the name of the show.\n\n2:05:13.920 --> 2:05:14.920\n Thank you for having me.\n\n2:05:14.920 --> 2:05:20.000\n A couple of times, it's great to sort of get him to in this loose way to talk about different\n\n2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:21.000\n kinds of stuff.\n\n2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:22.000\n I don't think we talked about race at all.\n\n2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:27.440\n So I'm just bringing it back to what you were asking, which is if you read the Wikipedia,\n\n2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:31.640\n the perspective is going to be this guy talks about slavery constantly, where it's completely\n\n2:05:31.640 --> 2:05:33.480\n disproportionate to his work.\n\n2:05:33.480 --> 2:05:38.140\n But even on your show, you can tell even not outside of the race stuff that he's not ultra\n\n2:05:38.140 --> 2:05:44.360\n careful about, he's not nuanced.\n\n2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:48.920\n He's not afraid to say something just like, I would say, let me just criticize him, my\n\n2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:53.440\n face is not used as me, carelessly say something controversial.\n\n2:05:53.440 --> 2:06:01.740\n I'm not saying he doesn't go, that makes him, it's a very different thing than somebody\n\n2:06:01.740 --> 2:06:08.320\n who on purpose says something controversial stuff, like Milo Annapolis, sorry, I forgot\n\n2:06:08.320 --> 2:06:11.000\n Milo, whatever his name is.\n\n2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:15.120\n Which is really nice to see that he's a genuine person who's thoughtful, he doesn't mean to,\n\n2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:23.000\n but he just carelessly seems to say things that I feel like damaged the rest of his body\n\n2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:24.000\n of work.\n\n2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:29.200\n I can't really speak for him, but I would guess his point is once you're swimming in\n\n2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:34.600\n this kind of worldview, you're going to be anathema already.\n\n2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:36.920\n So there's no pleasing these people, so why bother trying?\n\n2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:41.080\n Yeah, I think that's a deeply, that's a black pill way of seeing the world.\n\n2:06:41.080 --> 2:06:46.220\n It's not black pilled at all, because it's a cynical way that these people, so it's saying\n\n2:06:46.220 --> 2:06:53.760\n that it's a very kind of way of thinking, I'll say whatever I want, whoever comes along\n\n2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:54.760\n with me.\n\n2:06:54.760 --> 2:06:59.360\n You just earlier said yourself that race, racism has been weaponized as a way to shut\n\n2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:00.760\n down conversation.\n\n2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:06.520\n So I think his perspective would be, I am so outside the mainstream in my worldview\n\n2:07:06.520 --> 2:07:09.940\n that I know I'm going to be called racism, racist.\n\n2:07:09.940 --> 2:07:14.200\n So there's no point in trying to be nuanced because I'm already going to get the scarlet\n\n2:07:14.200 --> 2:07:15.200\n letter.\n\n2:07:15.200 --> 2:07:21.280\n Yeah, I just disagree with that because for example, I am one person that he turned off\n\n2:07:21.280 --> 2:07:25.080\n by his carelessness, and I think I should be a good target.\n\n2:07:25.080 --> 2:07:26.080\n I should be somebody.\n\n2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:27.160\n I think that's fair.\n\n2:07:27.160 --> 2:07:33.160\n And I'm just like, he, it's very convenient to think that there's ridiculous people out\n\n2:07:33.160 --> 2:07:37.000\n there, which they are, who call everybody racist and sexist currently.\n\n2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.140\n And then you can't please them.\n\n2:07:39.140 --> 2:07:44.640\n So I'm not even going to try, no, but there's like this gray area of people that I don't\n\n2:07:44.640 --> 2:07:48.920\n listen to the outreach culture, whatever that I don't, this Wikipedia article means nothing\n\n2:07:48.920 --> 2:07:49.920\n to me.\n\n2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:55.040\n I'm not going to, I'm more, I'm just seeing this careless person.\n\n2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:02.520\n And if he's going to be careless about a race like this, I feel like if I walk along with\n\n2:08:02.520 --> 2:08:06.800\n him long enough, I'm going to catch the carelessness.\n\n2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:12.200\n I'm going to lose like, I'll defend your perspective better than you can.\n\n2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:13.520\n This is good.\n\n2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:14.600\n I'm taking notes.\n\n2:08:14.600 --> 2:08:18.640\n I talked to Eric Weinstein after you guys talked about me on your show.\n\n2:08:18.640 --> 2:08:19.880\n We had a good conversation.\n\n2:08:19.880 --> 2:08:20.880\n He invited me on his show.\n\n2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:22.640\n That would be an amazing conversation.\n\n2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:28.200\n And we got on the phone and his concern, fairly, he goes, I don't want you to come on my show\n\n2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:31.120\n for the purposes of clowning me.\n\n2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:32.960\n And I would never do that.\n\n2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:33.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:34.960\n It would never.\n\n2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:36.560\n He might not be aware of who you are.\n\n2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:37.720\n That's why he wants to feel me out.\n\n2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:40.460\n He's like, you know, when he hears troll, it can mean a lot of different things.\n\n2:08:40.460 --> 2:08:44.000\n And I, we had a very conversation and very much was very clear that that's not where\n\n2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:45.700\n the conversation would go.\n\n2:08:45.700 --> 2:08:51.320\n But I think when you are going to be on someone's show, there is a responsibility that they're\n\n2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:54.900\n not going to have to pay a cost for having you as their guests.\n\n2:08:54.900 --> 2:08:59.360\n So if you're perceived, if you were put off by how he was in that live streams or two,\n\n2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:01.640\n I did like, I understand where you're coming from.\n\n2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:05.660\n I think he's very, very bright, but you have a very, you have a different audience than\n\n2:09:05.660 --> 2:09:06.660\n I do.\n\n2:09:06.660 --> 2:09:07.660\n And you're going for something different than I am.\n\n2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:08.660\n No, no, no.\n\n2:09:08.660 --> 2:09:11.760\n Like in my interest, the sense of.\n\n2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:12.760\n You wouldn't feel safe with him.\n\n2:09:12.760 --> 2:09:13.760\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:14.760\n I wouldn't feel safe with him.\n\n2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:15.760\n That's a really boring line for me.\n\n2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:21.120\n I think I would like to actually talk to him one day, Alex Jones has crossed the other\n\n2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:22.120\n line for me.\n\n2:09:22.120 --> 2:09:25.440\n Well, you could do what you could do with me, tape the episode and then never release\n\n2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:26.440\n it.\n\n2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:33.960\n No, it's, it's one of those things will be when there's finally they'll, they'll make\n\n2:09:33.960 --> 2:09:38.400\n a history channel documentary about you and I and how it all went wrong.\n\n2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:42.320\n Like the cult that we started and then everybody killed themselves.\n\n2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:49.360\n And there's a, we'll release it then because it'll be like unseen footage.\n\n2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:56.560\n This is how it started is it'll be black and white in a basement somewhere in New York.\n\n2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:57.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:57.560 --> 2:09:58.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:58.560 --> 2:09:59.560\n My mother's basement.\n\n2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:01.640\n Let's explain so much.\n\n2:10:01.640 --> 2:10:02.640\n Okay.\n\n2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:13.440\n So I spoke to Yaron Brooke about objectivism and Ayn Rand, he, he kind of argued, he highlighted\n\n2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:23.880\n difference between capitalism and anarchism as around the topic of violence and the, that\n\n2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:32.100\n having government be the sort of the, the negative way to say it is like having a monopoly\n\n2:10:32.100 --> 2:10:39.400\n on violence, but basically being the arbiter of, or the, the people that making sure that\n\n2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:42.040\n violence doesn't get out of hand.\n\n2:10:42.040 --> 2:10:43.040\n That would, you know.\n\n2:10:43.040 --> 2:10:44.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:45.040\n 2020 showed that.\n\n2:10:45.040 --> 2:10:46.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:46.040 --> 2:10:47.040\n The government's great at that.\n\n2:10:47.040 --> 2:10:48.040\n Yep.\n\n2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:49.040\n Well, what, what's, okay.\n\n2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:50.040\n Without.\n\n2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:51.840\n This is him with a straight face making that argument.\n\n2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:52.840\n Good work Yaron.\n\n2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:53.840\n All right.\n\n2:10:53.840 --> 2:11:02.840\n Well, can you with a straight face argue for the idea that in anarchism, violence would\n\n2:11:02.840 --> 2:11:04.480\n not get out of hand?\n\n2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:05.480\n Sure.\n\n2:11:05.480 --> 2:11:10.300\n For one thing, if your worst argument against that, one of my little quotes is what are\n\n2:11:10.300 --> 2:11:14.160\n presented as the strongest arguments against anarchism are inevitably description of the\n\n2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:15.400\n Strasquo.\n\n2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:21.000\n So the argument is under anarchism, you know, you'd have warlords, you know, killing people\n\n2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.520\n and then you'd have, you know, whoever's strongest gets to just take over a neighborhood.\n\n2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:27.400\n Well, we have that now.\n\n2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:33.320\n We saw that the police are perfectly comfortable disarming the population.\n\n2:11:33.320 --> 2:11:37.200\n And then when they try to protect themselves or punished, they're, we're happy to stand\n\n2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:38.200\n down.\n\n2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:42.220\n You can't, you can only have that happen if you have a monopoly.\n\n2:11:42.220 --> 2:11:45.720\n If they're like, let's suppose you had a television stations, right?\n\n2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:47.800\n And CBS said, you know what?\n\n2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:49.440\n We're not going to broadcast.\n\n2:11:49.440 --> 2:11:50.440\n Cool.\n\n2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:51.440\n We're not going to broadcast.\n\n2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:53.240\n We're going to watch any of these other channels.\n\n2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:57.800\n So the problem with having monopoly is everyone has to be dependent on this issue.\n\n2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:02.960\n What's amazing about minarchism, which objectivists are, is they will argue that government is\n\n2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:07.560\n really, really bad at everything it does and it touches.\n\n2:12:07.560 --> 2:12:10.960\n Therefore it has to be in charge of the most important stuff.\n\n2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:16.560\n Well, that's not therefore, but, but there is a thing that's fundamentally different\n\n2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:17.560\n than all the other things.\n\n2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:24.720\n And Yaron Brook also said that no government has, this is on your show, has ever worked\n\n2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:26.180\n in the way he's proposing.\n\n2:12:26.180 --> 2:12:31.520\n Now objectivism, Ayn Rand's philosophy is based on objective reality.\n\n2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:36.960\n And what she posited is you look and study the facts of nature, facts of reality and\n\n2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:39.000\n deduce things accordingly.\n\n2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:43.920\n And she very much regards herself as part of the Aristotelian tradition, as opposed\n\n2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:49.120\n to the Platonist tradition, where the idea precedes reality and the idea is more real\n\n2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:50.800\n than what we see around us.\n\n2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:59.000\n So what he's saying is all the data, according to him, contradicts his argument, but still\n\n2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:03.760\n he's going to make this imaginary government that has never existed and there's no evidence\n\n2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:06.520\n that it can exist.\n\n2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:12.200\n Let's talk about objective law, to have access to the legal system, which is something we\n\n2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:13.200\n want.\n\n2:13:13.200 --> 2:13:17.040\n And just in terms of selling disputes, when you have a government monopoly, it's going\n\n2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:20.660\n to be more expensive, more difficult for poor people.\n\n2:13:20.660 --> 2:13:24.160\n The cost of hiring a lawyer is more expensive than hiring a surgeon.\n\n2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:31.000\n You can't say with a straight face, this is the only way or the best way.\n\n2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:36.960\n And the other thing is the argument for objectivism, against anarchism, they have this stupid\n\n2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:43.280\n claim it's like, what if you're a member of one security company and I'm a member of another\n\n2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:45.640\n and we have a dispute and one shows up the door.\n\n2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:47.120\n What happens now?\n\n2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:49.000\n As if this is some insuperable argument.\n\n2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.320\n Well, we have that on earth.\n\n2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:54.080\n Every country is in a state of anarchism regarding every other country.\n\n2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:55.660\n We don't have a world government.\n\n2:13:55.660 --> 2:14:00.520\n So what happens if a Canadian kills an American in Mexico?\n\n2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:01.520\n I have no idea.\n\n2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:03.080\n I bet you don't have an idea.\n\n2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:09.160\n What I'm sure of is that system has been worked out ahead of time between the three countries\n\n2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:13.480\n and it's been worked out in such a way that you and I don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:15.240\n Same thing with cell phone companies.\n\n2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:19.400\n If I'm on Sprint, you're on Metro PCS and I call you, who pays?\n\n2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:20.880\n Does Sprint pay you?\n\n2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:21.880\n Do they split the difference?\n\n2:14:21.880 --> 2:14:26.840\n First of all, there's no objective way that one has to work, but the thing is companies\n\n2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:30.840\n who have auto accidents, they have arbitrage all the time.\n\n2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:36.440\n Like if I run into you, they work it out and it never reaches our desk.\n\n2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:42.080\n So the only thing that cops are good at is keeping people, at any government monopoly,\n\n2:14:42.080 --> 2:14:45.000\n is forcing people to be their customers by keeping them unsafe.\n\n2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:46.000\n Okay.\n\n2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:51.600\n There's a few things I'd like to say there to just explore some of these ideas.\n\n2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:57.360\n So one is in terms of Canadian and Mexico and so on, that it does, something has been\n\n2:14:57.360 --> 2:14:58.920\n worked out perhaps.\n\n2:14:58.920 --> 2:14:59.920\n Not perhaps.\n\n2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:00.920\n Perhaps.\n\n2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:05.160\n Do you know for sure that if there's a point I'm trying to make, so let's say for sure\n\n2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:07.240\n it's been worked out.\n\n2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:11.960\n There was a point in history where it wasn't worked out.\n\n2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:17.000\n To work, to come to a place of stability, there has to first be some instability.\n\n2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:24.000\n So when you first, like for every kind of situation, they're like dispute over space,\n\n2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.280\n like who gets to own Mars, that kind of thing.\n\n2:15:26.280 --> 2:15:27.280\n Sure.\n\n2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:33.320\n For it, and then these different competing institutions will have to figure it out.\n\n2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:38.680\n And so there's the concern with anarchism, I think, or with any kind of interaction.\n\n2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:44.600\n You said brilliantly that there's an anarchism relative to the, there's no one world government.\n\n2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:45.600\n Right.\n\n2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:56.440\n Alex Jones enters the chat, but the fear is that there's going to be an instability that\n\n2:15:56.440 --> 2:15:58.840\n doesn't converge towards some stable place.\n\n2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:00.060\n That is not the fear.\n\n2:16:00.060 --> 2:16:03.600\n That is the goal under Ayn Rand's philosophy.\n\n2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:08.100\n Markets have something what they always talk about as being creatively destructive, which\n\n2:16:08.100 --> 2:16:12.360\n means you look at something that's been happening for a very long time.\n\n2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:16.400\n Every generation, every innovator starts chipping away at it.\n\n2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:20.120\n He finds better ways, marginal improvement or marginal, or it doesn't work and he goes\n\n2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:21.120\n broke.\n\n2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:25.600\n When government tries to implement improvement, we all have to suffer the consequences.\n\n2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:28.200\n When an innovator does, it's a huge asymmetry.\n\n2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:30.120\n If it hurts, it only hurts him.\n\n2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:34.480\n If it succeeds, he becomes rich and we all profit as a consequence.\n\n2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:39.560\n But the fear of anarchism, I think, is that it will be non creative destruction.\n\n2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:43.160\n It'll be just destruction, right?\n\n2:16:43.160 --> 2:16:47.680\n It's not like the instability.\n\n2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:51.800\n Stability is one of these words that sounds objective, but has no real meaning.\n\n2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:55.120\n What field has stability?\n\n2:16:55.120 --> 2:16:56.840\n Let's suppose you want stability.\n\n2:16:56.840 --> 2:16:57.840\n Relationships.\n\n2:16:57.840 --> 2:16:58.840\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:58.840 --> 2:16:59.840\n Let's talk about medicine.\n\n2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:02.760\n Stability means we're not going to invent new diseases or new treatments, right?\n\n2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:08.700\n If you mean stability in terms of a baseline of security, we have that already.\n\n2:17:08.700 --> 2:17:11.560\n Very few relationships turn violent.\n\n2:17:11.560 --> 2:17:14.960\n Under an anarchist system, look at it right now.\n\n2:17:14.960 --> 2:17:21.080\n If you look at a bar full of drunken young males full of testosterone, if you look at\n\n2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:29.080\n a hotel where everyone is not native to the area, those are both far safer than the places\n\n2:17:29.080 --> 2:17:32.420\n that the government has taken upon itself to protect you.\n\n2:17:32.420 --> 2:17:36.400\n The parks, the alleyways, the streets, the subways.\n\n2:17:36.400 --> 2:17:41.240\n We have right now a comparison of which is better at keeping people safe.\n\n2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:46.440\n And it's very obvious that when something is private and under someone's control, and\n\n2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:50.460\n there would be layers of there'd be more police, but they wouldn't be a government monopoly.\n\n2:17:50.460 --> 2:17:54.200\n The store would have someone, the street would have someone, and you'd have your own personal\n\n2:17:54.200 --> 2:17:56.660\n security that would be attached to your phone.\n\n2:17:56.660 --> 2:18:02.440\n Having security as a function of geography as opposed to a function of you as an individual\n\n2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:05.700\n is a landline technology in a post cell phone world.\n\n2:18:05.700 --> 2:18:11.840\n So you think it's possible to have, psychologically speaking, as an individual among the masses,\n\n2:18:11.840 --> 2:18:17.600\n to have a sense of security even though there's not a centralized thing at the bottom of the\n\n2:18:17.600 --> 2:18:18.600\n whole thing?\n\n2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:24.960\n Like, there's not a set of laws that are enforced based on geography like we have nations now.\n\n2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:30.280\n You can have a set of laws that are enforced in some kind of emergent agreed upon way.\n\n2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:35.080\n So like, basically, I want to go to a hotel and trust that I'll be able to get a room\n\n2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:41.040\n and nobody's going to break down the door and I don't know, take all my vodka.\n\n2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:42.520\n Let's take a different way.\n\n2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:46.700\n If you were worried about a hotel having bedbugs, that's not something the government's involved\n\n2:18:46.700 --> 2:18:47.700\n in.\n\n2:18:47.700 --> 2:18:50.680\n And that's not an unrealistic concern.\n\n2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:54.680\n Are there mechanisms right now that you can undertake to make sure that's not the case?\n\n2:18:54.680 --> 2:18:55.680\n Yes.\n\n2:18:55.680 --> 2:19:01.560\n So it would be the same thing with, I want to make sure I go to a hotel that has security.\n\n2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:03.080\n It would be exactly the same thing.\n\n2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:06.440\n And here's another example, kosher food.\n\n2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:09.880\n People who keep kosher, Jews who keep kosher, their food has to be prepared in a certain\n\n2:19:09.880 --> 2:19:10.880\n way.\n\n2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:13.080\n It has to meet higher rabbinical standards, right?\n\n2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:18.520\n If you look at food, it will have that certification, the K, and there's even competition there.\n\n2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:20.760\n There's the K and there's the stricter U letter.\n\n2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:22.560\n People don't notice it because they're looking for it.\n\n2:19:22.560 --> 2:19:28.520\n You would have companies certifying different locales for their level of security.\n\n2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:34.000\n And it would take an hour to have an app that would, just like when you have toll roads,\n\n2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:35.000\n right?\n\n2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:38.120\n That would tell you you're approaching an unsafe area, you're not going to be covered\n\n2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:41.920\n by us or, and you could have it color coded very easily.\n\n2:19:41.920 --> 2:19:43.920\n We could do this today.\n\n2:19:43.920 --> 2:19:48.640\n But the thing is, you're exactly correct, but there's an assumption of you're already\n\n2:19:48.640 --> 2:19:53.240\n in a, okay, you can give me a different word than stability, but you're already in a place\n\n2:19:53.240 --> 2:19:57.960\n where the forces of the market or whatever can operate.\n\n2:19:57.960 --> 2:20:05.880\n The worry is like, initially, you might not have enough stability to where you can choose\n\n2:20:05.880 --> 2:20:10.200\n one place over the other based on the security that they provide.\n\n2:20:10.200 --> 2:20:14.440\n We already have different types of security here because we have federal government, we\n\n2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:17.520\n have state governments and we have local governments.\n\n2:20:17.520 --> 2:20:20.600\n So and these often contradict each other.\n\n2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:25.340\n So the idea of the implausibility of having different security companies and having it\n\n2:20:25.340 --> 2:20:31.160\n be unstable or impossible, we already have a very rough example of it happening in real\n\n2:20:31.160 --> 2:20:32.160\n life.\n\n2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:41.240\n So how all of it started, the idea of, especially with Yaron, is like it all started with government\n\n2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:47.240\n monopoly of violence saying like, no kids, don't let violence get out of hand.\n\n2:20:47.240 --> 2:20:48.240\n So like how do...\n\n2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:51.840\n We had a civil war where half the country was slaughtered.\n\n2:20:51.840 --> 2:20:56.760\n That's the display of the government not having a monopoly on the violence, right?\n\n2:20:56.760 --> 2:20:58.460\n It's like, that's the split.\n\n2:20:58.460 --> 2:21:02.680\n They had such a monopoly on the violence in the North that it could draft people to fight\n\n2:21:02.680 --> 2:21:03.680\n others that they didn't even care about.\n\n2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:07.600\n But there's a South.\n\n2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:14.900\n It's the government splitting because this is giant iceberg like splitting.\n\n2:21:14.900 --> 2:21:21.600\n The argument is that you would have something like a civil war much more often under anarchism.\n\n2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:27.200\n First of all, if you had a civil war much more often, we don't have that with car companies,\n\n2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:28.200\n right?\n\n2:21:28.200 --> 2:21:32.240\n We don't have a company that says, I refuse to pay or whatever.\n\n2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:33.240\n That's not violence.\n\n2:21:33.240 --> 2:21:34.920\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:35.920\n And I'm playing...\n\n2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:36.920\n Hold on, let me finish.\n\n2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:42.800\n It is violence because if I'm a company and I'm saying that my cars can run over yours\n\n2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:48.160\n with no consequences, this is a rough analog, why has that not happened?\n\n2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:53.840\n Now in terms of having security system, if I am free, just like switching cell phone\n\n2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:58.480\n to go from one provider to another and this one company as part of its payment doesn't\n\n2:21:58.480 --> 2:22:04.360\n want $50 a month, $100 a month, wants my son, I'm not going to be a member of this security\n\n2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:09.120\n company unless in that case we're dealing with something like a Pearl Harbor or foreign\n\n2:22:09.120 --> 2:22:12.160\n invasion where it's like all hands on deck.\n\n2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:13.760\n Let's go by evidence.\n\n2:22:13.760 --> 2:22:17.960\n How many places do have evidence of that you can have at a large scale?\n\n2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:21.120\n Well, it's absolutely in a large scale.\n\n2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:24.320\n Because it feels like once you don't know the person.\n\n2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:25.320\n What about eBay?\n\n2:22:25.320 --> 2:22:27.480\n eBay is an example of anarchism in practice.\n\n2:22:27.480 --> 2:22:31.420\n I am selling something to someone whose name I don't even know in a country that is nowhere\n\n2:22:31.420 --> 2:22:34.900\n proximate to me and eBay acts as the arbiter.\n\n2:22:34.900 --> 2:22:38.040\n Sometimes I don't get the money after I get screwed over, but that's far less than the\n\n2:22:38.040 --> 2:22:40.160\n taxation that I have to give to the federal government.\n\n2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:43.600\n It's a great point, but it's in the space of finance.\n\n2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:49.200\n If I could, if on eBay you could also commit violence.\n\n2:22:49.200 --> 2:22:50.200\n Theft is violence.\n\n2:22:50.200 --> 2:22:51.200\n No.\n\n2:22:51.200 --> 2:22:57.000\n Yeah, if you give me 10 grand for a car and I don't deliver anything, you've stolen 10\n\n2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:58.000\n grand from me.\n\n2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:06.160\n Yes, but there's something uniquely problematic to being stabbed or shot.\n\n2:23:06.160 --> 2:23:11.720\n The reason you're stabbed or shot is because the government, despite its contract, is refusing\n\n2:23:11.720 --> 2:23:17.640\n to allow second amendment rights to be implemented among the citizenry and the people who are\n\n2:23:17.640 --> 2:23:20.160\n making that the case are the cops.\n\n2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:23.720\n They are the ones who are the traitors to the constitution and should be regarded as\n\n2:23:23.720 --> 2:23:24.720\n such.\n\n2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:31.280\n Whereas private companies are far more amenable to market pressures than the state is.\n\n2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:37.920\n It's a strong argument, but let's actually just briefly mention the scale thing.\n\n2:23:37.920 --> 2:23:40.720\n Why don't you think we should talk about scale?\n\n2:23:40.720 --> 2:23:45.480\n Because if you had anarchism just in Vermont or just in Brooklyn, well, fine.\n\n2:23:45.480 --> 2:23:48.920\n The people make the argument you need anarchism or else China's going to invade, but that's\n\n2:23:48.920 --> 2:23:52.080\n like saying what, do these little countries don't exist?\n\n2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:53.520\n Does San Salvador not exist?\n\n2:23:53.520 --> 2:23:58.080\n Some of them are violent, some of them are not, but the point is they're not all at moments\n\n2:23:58.080 --> 2:23:59.600\n notice about to be invaded.\n\n2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:01.040\n Kuwait's an example of this.\n\n2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:05.760\n Kuwait was invaded by Iraq and very quickly all the big countries who are interested in\n\n2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:11.300\n having your stability, safe space, got involved and kicked him out of Kuwait.\n\n2:24:11.300 --> 2:24:17.200\n If you had this company that was waging war on the population, it seems quite likely that\n\n2:24:17.200 --> 2:24:20.440\n the other organization would get together and put a stop to this because they're not\n\n2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:23.520\n in a position to provide this service of security to their customers.\n\n2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:24.520\n Okay.\n\n2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:30.840\n All of this is brilliant, but didn't you just say that we are actually in a state of anarchism\n\n2:24:30.840 --> 2:24:32.560\n relative to other countries?\n\n2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:33.560\n Yes.\n\n2:24:33.560 --> 2:24:35.360\n So isn't this what emerges?\n\n2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:41.840\n This is what, aren't we actually living in a state of anarchism where we all have agreed?\n\n2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:43.080\n I haven't agreed to anything.\n\n2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:52.640\n So the basic criticism you have is you're born on a geographical area and you're forced\n\n2:24:52.640 --> 2:24:59.840\n to have signed a bunch of stuff just by being born in a particular place.\n\n2:24:59.840 --> 2:25:08.720\n So really, if you could just much easier choose which space of ideas you associated with,\n\n2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:12.000\n that would be actually a state of anarchism.\n\n2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:17.200\n And you could have like a military that you sign up with.\n\n2:25:17.200 --> 2:25:18.320\n Sure.\n\n2:25:18.320 --> 2:25:22.080\n And you're certainly not putting people in prison to get raped because they're selling\n\n2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:23.080\n drugs.\n\n2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:24.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:25:24.080 --> 2:25:30.400\n And you're certainly not allowing everyone else on the street who wants to be there.\n\n2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:32.560\n Can we say something nice about Ayn Rand?\n\n2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:34.680\n I can talk about nice things about her all day.\n\n2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:36.640\n I own her copy of the Fountainhead, you know.\n\n2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:43.920\n What to you is Ayn Rand's best idea, one that you find impactful, insightful, useful for\n\n2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:47.040\n us in modern society that you think about?\n\n2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:54.640\n That your life has meaning and productive work is your highest value.\n\n2:25:54.640 --> 2:26:00.040\n And that you shouldn't apologize, and this is something I despise, you shouldn't apologize\n\n2:26:00.040 --> 2:26:05.780\n for saying, I want to be happy and I'm going to work toward that.\n\n2:26:05.780 --> 2:26:11.400\n And that, there's a few others, that you owe nobody else, some random stranger, a second\n\n2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:12.640\n of your time.\n\n2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:17.320\n You see this a lot on Twitter and social media, people like demanding a debate or demanding\n\n2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:19.800\n you act a certain way and engage with them.\n\n2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:22.120\n You don't owe them anything.\n\n2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:25.880\n So I think those are some of her best ideas.\n\n2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:27.240\n And she teaches you how to think.\n\n2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:29.920\n Ayn Rand does not have all the answers, but she has all the questions.\n\n2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:32.320\n Do you think, what do you think about the whole selfishness thing?\n\n2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:37.520\n I mean, are you triggered by the word selfishness?\n\n2:26:37.520 --> 2:26:41.520\n It's really unfortunate what she does because you were just talking earlier about Moldbug\n\n2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:47.520\n being carelessly, this is indefensible in my opinion.\n\n2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:53.640\n So she talks about the virtue of selfishness and she claims that when people talk about\n\n2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:58.200\n selfishness, they mean concern primarily with the self, they don't.\n\n2:26:58.200 --> 2:27:02.440\n When people talk about selfishness, they mean in a sociopathic way, concern exclusively\n\n2:27:02.440 --> 2:27:03.720\n with oneself.\n\n2:27:03.720 --> 2:27:09.120\n They mean like, oh, if someone is dying on the street, I'm not going to even waste a\n\n2:27:09.120 --> 2:27:11.500\n second saving them because I'm selfish.\n\n2:27:11.500 --> 2:27:15.320\n So she sets up this complete caricature of the term.\n\n2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:21.080\n When she's attacking selflessness in her best sense is when there are people who have no\n\n2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:27.260\n sense of self, they have no values of their own, they have no goals of their own, everything\n\n2:27:27.260 --> 2:27:31.680\n that's in their mind is gotten secondhand from the culture at large and there's nothing\n\n2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:36.560\n unique or special from their perspective worth fighting for.\n\n2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:43.120\n So when she attacks, when she advocates for the self, she basically means self development,\n\n2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:44.960\n self improvement and achievement.\n\n2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:52.360\n So I think that word choice is really false and needlessly off putting.\n\n2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:57.280\n Yeah, controversial perhaps for the purpose of being controversial, I don't know, but\n\n2:27:57.280 --> 2:27:59.360\n it's just, it's not accurate.\n\n2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:01.240\n That's not what people mean by selfishness.\n\n2:28:01.240 --> 2:28:09.280\n Yeah, I would say it's one of the reasons probably her philosophy is not as much adopted\n\n2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:13.960\n or thought about is like, it's funny, like the use of words means something.\n\n2:28:13.960 --> 2:28:17.560\n Exactly as you said, that's my criticism, I mentioned small bug, which could be incorrect\n\n2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:21.520\n criticism by the way, so I'm not exactly sure.\n\n2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:28.000\n Can we talk about some modern day chaos and politics?\n\n2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:29.000\n Yes, please.\n\n2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:30.000\n I hate chaos.\n\n2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.680\n Speaking of your hatred for chaos, let's talk about secession.\n\n2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:36.200\n Oh yeah, I was the first one on this trip.\n\n2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:39.960\n Yeah, you were, well, the Civil War beat you to it, but.\n\n2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:41.760\n Sure, in contemporary times.\n\n2:28:41.760 --> 2:28:45.520\n In contemporary times you were, you're on this.\n\n2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:52.960\n Can you talk about what is the idea of secession, what are the odds that it might happen, what\n\n2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:58.640\n does it mean for the United States in some way for different states to secede?\n\n2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:02.760\n Sure, America's been one country with several cultures since the beginning.\n\n2:29:02.760 --> 2:29:07.520\n There's absolutely no reason for someone, this goes back to the anarchist idea, if you\n\n2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:12.460\n despise Donald Trump, which is your prerogative, if you think Joe Biden is a clown, which is\n\n2:29:12.460 --> 2:29:18.060\n your prerogative, there's absolutely no reason for you to be governed by someone you disapprove\n\n2:29:18.060 --> 2:29:19.060\n of.\n\n2:29:19.060 --> 2:29:21.420\n This is an incoherent, nonsensical concept.\n\n2:29:21.420 --> 2:29:25.360\n The only reason we even take it as a hypothesis is that we're trained to the contrary since\n\n2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:26.360\n kindergarten.\n\n2:29:26.360 --> 2:29:33.200\n A secession, I don't know along what lines, but increasingly it's becoming harder and\n\n2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:35.960\n harder for people to have conversations.\n\n2:29:35.960 --> 2:29:39.960\n I think social media, and this is something people despise social media for, I think this\n\n2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:45.200\n is something that social media has done well, which I'm advocating for, is it tends to\n\n2:29:45.200 --> 2:29:49.320\n kind of run through ideas through like an evolutionary process and drive them to the\n\n2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:50.320\n logical conclusion.\n\n2:29:50.320 --> 2:29:54.260\n So it's very hard to be a moderate online because there's going to be people pushing\n\n2:29:54.260 --> 2:29:57.560\n through your ideas through several cycles, and then you're going to end up at some kind\n\n2:29:57.560 --> 2:30:02.060\n of more pure, or if you want to dislike it, extreme perspective.\n\n2:30:02.060 --> 2:30:07.520\n Having these different pockets, it's not really governable because people fundamentally have\n\n2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:09.160\n different worldviews.\n\n2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:11.180\n So I don't know what secession would look like.\n\n2:30:11.180 --> 2:30:17.360\n I think the number is really increasing at an exponential rate.\n\n2:30:17.360 --> 2:30:20.360\n I do not think the number of supporters.\n\n2:30:20.360 --> 2:30:24.640\n I think the claim that this can only be accomplished through violence is false.\n\n2:30:24.640 --> 2:30:26.080\n It's a lie.\n\n2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:31.680\n Just like any divorce doesn't have to involve beating your ex husband or ex wife.\n\n2:30:31.680 --> 2:30:37.840\n And I'm very much looking forward to this becoming a reality far quicker than I ever\n\n2:30:37.840 --> 2:30:38.840\n expected.\n\n2:30:38.840 --> 2:30:48.760\n Do you think there's a value of competing worldviews being forced to be in the same\n\n2:30:48.760 --> 2:30:49.760\n space?\n\n2:30:49.760 --> 2:30:52.320\n Yes, but within a context.\n\n2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:59.160\n So we can agree if group one thinks A, B, and C are the fundamental aspects of the worldview\n\n2:30:59.160 --> 2:31:04.680\n and argue within that, and group two thinks D, E, and F and argue within that.\n\n2:31:04.680 --> 2:31:07.080\n So you're going to have a lot of argument within those space.\n\n2:31:07.080 --> 2:31:12.920\n And if there's fundamental differences in worldview, there's no reason to be, especially\n\n2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:15.600\n when each views the other as completely coherent and unreasonable.\n\n2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:25.800\n Do you think there's a line of fundamentally different worldviews along which a secession\n\n2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:27.520\n will happen in the United States?\n\n2:31:27.520 --> 2:31:34.960\n Is there something that emerges to you as a set of ideas that are like, what do you\n\n2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:35.960\n call that?\n\n2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:38.920\n That you can't come to an agreement over?\n\n2:31:38.920 --> 2:31:40.880\n Yeah, I think that's already happening.\n\n2:31:40.880 --> 2:31:46.760\n Like with the masks, I think there's just two fundamental perspective and each one thinks\n\n2:31:46.760 --> 2:31:51.980\n the other is insane and also deadly and destructive.\n\n2:31:51.980 --> 2:31:56.600\n And I don't see how there's any discourse on this topic.\n\n2:31:56.600 --> 2:31:59.520\n So on the left, I wouldn't say it's left versus right.\n\n2:31:59.520 --> 2:32:04.640\n I think it's people who are pro risk versus people who are risk averse.\n\n2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:07.200\n Yeah, so risk averse.\n\n2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:18.280\n And then there's like a hope for the comfort of the sort of a centralized science giving\n\n2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:23.120\n the truth and then everybody must follow the truth of the proper way to behave.\n\n2:32:23.120 --> 2:32:29.900\n And then there's on the other side, a distrust of any kind of centralized institutions of\n\n2:32:29.900 --> 2:32:37.520\n anybody who might use like control to try to gain greater and greater power and masks\n\n2:32:37.520 --> 2:32:38.760\n are a symbol of that.\n\n2:32:38.760 --> 2:32:48.680\n And even if masks are or are not a effective way of stopping the virus, which is really\n\n2:32:48.680 --> 2:32:53.600\n unfortunate to me from a perspective, I happen to be on a survey paper about masks.\n\n2:32:53.600 --> 2:32:57.840\n Like people don't seem to care about the data or the so on.\n\n2:32:57.840 --> 2:33:05.400\n This has become just a nice point on which to then highlight the difference between the\n\n2:33:05.400 --> 2:33:06.400\n two sides.\n\n2:33:06.400 --> 2:33:07.400\n Yeah, that's really interesting.\n\n2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:12.800\n I mean, it sounds kind of on the face kind of ridiculous that the succession would occur\n\n2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:13.800\n over masks.\n\n2:33:13.800 --> 2:33:18.240\n It wouldn't, but I'm saying this is an example of something where there's a clean break.\n\n2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:24.400\n And risk averse versus someone who's risk seeking, these are just two fundamentally\n\n2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:25.400\n different perspectives.\n\n2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:29.880\n Do you want to have an NHS or do you have one of a market based healthcare system?\n\n2:33:29.880 --> 2:33:32.360\n You can make very valid arguments for both.\n\n2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.520\n There's no reason for everyone to be under one.\n\n2:33:34.520 --> 2:33:39.800\n But do you think that's not something that's, you think that's irreconcilable, if that's\n\n2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:46.160\n the word, that that's not in the space of ideas that you can have in the same room together\n\n2:33:46.160 --> 2:33:49.400\n and they fight at each other and ultimately make progress like that.\n\n2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:53.320\n That succession is the more effective way to proceed forward.\n\n2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:54.320\n Yes.\n\n2:33:54.320 --> 2:34:04.440\n But do you see a possible world with no is the answer, meaning I know you say yes, because\n\n2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:07.360\n you kind of lean on the side of freedom and anarchism.\n\n2:34:07.360 --> 2:34:08.360\n Yes.\n\n2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:15.400\n Like you make, you want to make, let me make an argument in terms of divorce, which is\n\n2:34:15.400 --> 2:34:22.080\n in your worldview or your intuition is you want to make secession as frictionless as\n\n2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:23.080\n possible.\n\n2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:24.080\n Of course.\n\n2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:29.200\n And not just like states or whatever, just like you want to choose, you want to be free.\n\n2:34:29.200 --> 2:34:30.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:31.200\n And peaceful.\n\n2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:39.640\n Let me make my authoritarian, Russian, okay, Papa Stalin argument in terms of relationships.\n\n2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:42.960\n Like when shit goes wrong in a relationship.\n\n2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:45.960\n That's your language.\n\n2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:47.400\n Okay.\n\n2:34:47.400 --> 2:34:50.160\n There's only a place for one Stalin at this table.\n\n2:34:50.160 --> 2:34:51.160\n Okay.\n\n2:34:51.160 --> 2:34:52.160\n Okay.\n\n2:34:52.160 --> 2:34:53.160\n I'll get to be Lenin.\n\n2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:57.040\n Or you get to be like Merkel as our previous discussion with Putin.\n\n2:34:57.040 --> 2:34:58.040\n Okay.\n\n2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:00.960\n Don't let me unleash the hounds.\n\n2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:05.680\n You know, you want to work through some of the troubles before you get divorced.\n\n2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:09.040\n Like you want to do the work in relationships sometimes, like it goes up and down.\n\n2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:11.520\n It's been 200 plus years.\n\n2:35:11.520 --> 2:35:12.520\n It's done.\n\n2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:17.400\n But in the, listen, okay, so it's not a one night stand, but you know.\n\n2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:18.800\n Look at Trump.\n\n2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:20.960\n This I don't see the middle ground.\n\n2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:26.380\n He's either a complete calamity buffoon, or he's been the first great president we've\n\n2:35:26.380 --> 2:35:29.200\n had in like many, many years.\n\n2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:33.480\n So you think that there's something different now than it was 20 years ago?\n\n2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:34.480\n Yes.\n\n2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:37.460\n Social media and access to information.\n\n2:35:37.460 --> 2:35:39.520\n And the division will only increase, you think?\n\n2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:40.520\n Oh yes.\n\n2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:42.920\n So Trump is not an accident of history.\n\n2:35:42.920 --> 2:35:46.800\n So they thought Trump was the river, but he was the dam.\n\n2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:49.020\n Trump was the dam.\n\n2:35:49.020 --> 2:35:50.960\n They thought he was the river.\n\n2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:55.840\n So in that analogy, Trump being gone makes things worse.\n\n2:35:55.840 --> 2:35:56.840\n Yes.\n\n2:35:56.840 --> 2:36:01.220\n For that perspective, because now things are really going to hit the fan.\n\n2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:04.520\n So what are the odds of secession?\n\n2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:06.880\n I don't know.\n\n2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:12.800\n And my desperate hope is that it's peaceful, but I think the number of people who are becoming\n\n2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:17.640\n very comfortable with the violence is making me very unsettled.\n\n2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:21.920\n So I see words as violence and your Twitter.\n\n2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:27.040\n It's like Hiroshima times a million.\n\n2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.360\n Sometimes I curl up in the corner crying after I check your Twitter feed.\n\n2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:39.880\n So in all seriousness, you think it's possible to do nonviolent secession?\n\n2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:41.920\n It's like a Czechoslovakia.\n\n2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:43.200\n Look at Brexit.\n\n2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:45.200\n Brexit was a secession.\n\n2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:46.200\n Right.\n\n2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:50.800\n Right, so you can have a civil war did not need to be fought.\n\n2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:52.960\n That would have been a nonviolent secession.\n\n2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:55.820\n And if you worry about slavery, you could have bought off all the slaves, import them\n\n2:36:55.820 --> 2:36:56.980\n to the North.\n\n2:36:56.980 --> 2:36:59.760\n It still would have been cheaper and less loss of life and probably better for race\n\n2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:00.760\n relations.\n\n2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:01.760\n Yeah.\n\n2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:05.200\n I don't know enough history to, to wonder about like how the civil war could have been\n\n2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:06.200\n avoided.\n\n2:37:06.200 --> 2:37:11.020\n Well, that's how is a well conversation.\n\n2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:12.020\n So like, no, no.\n\n2:37:12.020 --> 2:37:14.560\n If they want to secede, say, look, here's what we're going to do.\n\n2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:18.160\n We're going to let you secede, but you have to end slavery.\n\n2:37:18.160 --> 2:37:19.320\n They seceded because of slavery.\n\n2:37:19.320 --> 2:37:20.320\n Here's the other thing.\n\n2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:23.280\n There's like this, some circles of conservatism have this myth that, oh, it wasn't about slavery,\n\n2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:24.480\n it was about state's rights.\n\n2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:28.520\n Well, if you go back, every state, when they seceded, released the press release.\n\n2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:31.000\n And they said explicitly, we're doing this because of slavery.\n\n2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:34.080\n So that is an abomination that needs to be taken care of.\n\n2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:37.960\n But other countries have ended slavery peacefully.\n\n2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:42.360\n One of the ways to do it is pay them by all, and we ended up doing this after the war.\n\n2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:47.680\n I think the South people got reparations, the slave owners, it was just insane.\n\n2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:48.680\n Bring them North.\n\n2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:50.520\n You want to go to Canada, whatever.\n\n2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:51.520\n And you agree.\n\n2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:53.900\n And that's our peace treaty.\n\n2:37:53.900 --> 2:37:56.260\n Because the people who died weren't the slave owners.\n\n2:37:56.260 --> 2:37:57.920\n It was white trash.\n\n2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:02.080\n And it was, that's who always, and I hate that that's the term, I can't think of a better\n\n2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:05.100\n one, but that's who always ends up fighting these wars often disproportionately.\n\n2:38:05.100 --> 2:38:07.520\n It's poor people and uneducated people.\n\n2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:09.800\n And I don't, I did not regard them as cannon fodder.\n\n2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:12.800\n I think it's horrible.\n\n2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:14.120\n So what would it look like?\n\n2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:16.000\n There would be two founding documents?\n\n2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:18.000\n Yeah, they had their constitution.\n\n2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:20.760\n Actually, I don't know the history of that.\n\n2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:24.800\n Yeah, they had a constitution, but it was much more decentralized.\n\n2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:35.520\n If secession doesn't happen, you said that Donald Trump was the dam, not the river.\n\n2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:37.960\n That sounds like Walt Whitman or something.\n\n2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:38.960\n It's poetry.\n\n2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:39.960\n Okay.\n\n2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:44.480\n Are you flirting with me?\n\n2:38:44.480 --> 2:38:45.880\n You know us, we don't flirt.\n\n2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:50.480\n We just club and drag you to the cave.\n\n2:38:50.480 --> 2:38:53.080\n We hammer and sickle.\n\n2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:54.600\n And you don't want to know about the sickle.\n\n2:38:54.600 --> 2:38:56.080\n It's not good cob, bad cob.\n\n2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:59.320\n It's bad cup for a sickle.\n\n2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:00.320\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:00.320 --> 2:39:07.560\n What do you think 2024 looks like in terms of the candidates?\n\n2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:11.320\n It's going to be Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.\n\n2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:15.680\n I'm really looking forward to Ted Cruz versus Mike Pence, because they're both very good\n\n2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:16.680\n at debate.\n\n2:39:16.680 --> 2:39:19.240\n That would be interesting to see how they differentiate themselves.\n\n2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:24.600\n But honestly, I don't, I mean, things are going to get really ugly really soon.\n\n2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:26.160\n What about Donald Trump coming back?\n\n2:39:26.160 --> 2:39:28.480\n He's not going to do it.\n\n2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:33.360\n So things, in my opinion, I think things are going to be really, really crazy in 2021.\n\n2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:35.960\n And talking about the dam being gone, like 2021.\n\n2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:37.600\n So this year coming up.\n\n2:39:37.600 --> 2:39:38.600\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:39.600\n It's going to be complete.\n\n2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:40.600\n It's going to be complete mayhem.\n\n2:39:40.600 --> 2:39:45.440\n What do you think, like prediction wise, and this is empirical.\n\n2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:51.640\n What do you think Donald Trump's Twitter feed looks like in 2021?\n\n2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:57.720\n Like if we're at the end of 2021, we'll look back and see like, what was the, you know,\n\n2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:01.800\n Obama gate exclamation points or we won.\n\n2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:07.720\n He is going to be, for the first time in history, holding the Republican party accountable to\n\n2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:10.000\n the base.\n\n2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:11.600\n We've never had that happen before.\n\n2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:17.440\n I think he's going to be holding their feet to the fire, radicalizing them.\n\n2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:21.640\n And given that they have the Senate, where it's going to be 50 50, the Democrats have\n\n2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:24.080\n a three seat majority in the House.\n\n2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:26.920\n This is not a governing coalition for either.\n\n2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:27.920\n It's going to be complete mayhem.\n\n2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:29.360\n What does that actually look like?\n\n2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:33.960\n What are the key values you think that he's going to try to push?\n\n2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:36.600\n I think it's just going to be very contrarian.\n\n2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:39.580\n He's going to be holding them accountable in terms of budgeting, even though he never\n\n2:40:39.580 --> 2:40:41.080\n did that as president.\n\n2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:44.760\n I think in terms of some kind of nominations, here's the thing.\n\n2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:53.880\n This is the first time since Nixon, 50 years and things weren't as politicized then, where\n\n2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:57.120\n an incoming president doesn't have control of the Senate.\n\n2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:01.020\n The Senate has the vote over cabinet positions.\n\n2:41:01.020 --> 2:41:08.760\n I do not see a possibility of them not trying to pick a fight on one or two of these nominations.\n\n2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:10.720\n And especially as revenge for Kavanaugh.\n\n2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:12.720\n This is going to get very bloody very quickly.\n\n2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:16.100\n And I think Mitch McConnell, there's a sadistic side to him.\n\n2:41:16.100 --> 2:41:19.400\n He revels in being the brakes on the car.\n\n2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:22.640\n And I think the base, it's just going to be throwing just, they're going to want some\n\n2:41:22.640 --> 2:41:23.640\n bone.\n\n2:41:23.640 --> 2:41:25.900\n It's like, oh yeah, we eliminated this one person.\n\n2:41:25.900 --> 2:41:28.180\n So that's going to get really ugly really quickly.\n\n2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:35.640\n You see it being quite divisive, like the division increasing, not stabilizing or decreasing.\n\n2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:37.360\n And I'll be doing my part.\n\n2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:42.800\n I know you'll be doing my part, but I'm trying to do my part and like trying to be like,\n\n2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:50.960\n to me, the division is shouting over people like Elon Musk, people who are actually building\n\n2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:53.840\n stuff and like accomplishing things in this world in terms of like.\n\n2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:56.120\n Elon said he took the red pill.\n\n2:41:56.120 --> 2:42:03.080\n No, see, you're talking about the, I'm talking about, forget Elon, SpaceX and Tesla and actually\n\n2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:07.920\n the good sides of like some of the things that Google is doing.\n\n2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:11.800\n Like actually building things, like making the world's information searchable, all that\n\n2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:12.800\n kind of stuff.\n\n2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:18.360\n Like all this stuff, you know, making actually the world a better place.\n\n2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:21.000\n There's a bunch of technologies that are increasing our quality of life.\n\n2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:22.640\n All this, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:42:22.640 --> 2:42:29.440\n I feel like they get like not much credit or in our public discourse because of the\n\n2:42:29.440 --> 2:42:30.440\n division.\n\n2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:36.000\n The division is just like, it's clouding our ability to concentrate on what's awesome about\n\n2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:37.000\n this world.\n\n2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.960\n Well, you know what would eliminate the division, right?\n\n2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:40.960\n Succession.\n\n2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:41.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:47.560\n See, I don't, I don't, it's hard for me to disagree.\n\n2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:57.360\n It's hard for me to disagree because, but at the same time, succession, I'm a romantic\n\n2:42:57.360 --> 2:42:59.720\n at heart and divorce breaks my heart.\n\n2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:00.720\n Cool.\n\n2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:07.400\n But do you want to live in a country where Joe Rogan is regarded as an example of someone\n\n2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:09.200\n who's spreading white supremacy?\n\n2:43:09.200 --> 2:43:10.200\n I don't.\n\n2:43:10.200 --> 2:43:13.960\n Well, but see, I feel like that's not the country we live in.\n\n2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:14.960\n That's just.\n\n2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:18.960\n The New York Times did it, the cathedral does it on a regular basis.\n\n2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:24.960\n Well, the cathedral is, okay, the cathedral, I guess you can maybe define the cathedral,\n\n2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:28.720\n but it's like the centralized institutions that have like a story that they're trying\n\n2:43:28.720 --> 2:43:29.720\n to sell and so on.\n\n2:43:29.720 --> 2:43:33.040\n Yeah, this is mold books concept, but yeah, they basically are set the limits of permissible\n\n2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:35.760\n discourse and create a narrative for the population to follow.\n\n2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:37.760\n But to me, that's a minority of people.\n\n2:43:37.760 --> 2:43:42.000\n Yeah, minorities always controlling everything in any country, the vast majority of the masses\n\n2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:43.000\n have no thought.\n\n2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:45.000\n But minorities can be overthrown and the.\n\n2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:46.560\n Sure, the circulation of the elites, yeah.\n\n2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:51.760\n The way the, no, no, no, and that's why the, what progress looks like is ridiculous people\n\n2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:52.760\n take power.\n\n2:43:52.760 --> 2:43:53.760\n Yes.\n\n2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:58.920\n And then they get annoying and new ridiculous people that are a little bit better overthrow\n\n2:43:58.920 --> 2:43:59.920\n the previous.\n\n2:43:59.920 --> 2:44:04.400\n No, I think progress happens despite the people who are in power, not because of them.\n\n2:44:04.400 --> 2:44:05.400\n Right.\n\n2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:08.880\n And so why is this a succession?\n\n2:44:08.880 --> 2:44:11.480\n So is it always about overthrowing the powerful?\n\n2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:12.600\n Is that how progress happens?\n\n2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:14.760\n No, I think progress happens despite the powerful.\n\n2:44:14.760 --> 2:44:18.560\n The powerful are going to do what's in their power to maintain their power and they're\n\n2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:21.960\n going to fight innovation because it's a threat to their control.\n\n2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:24.500\n There's always going to be the New York Times of the world, right?\n\n2:44:24.500 --> 2:44:26.560\n There's always going to be those, those people that haven't heard.\n\n2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:28.960\n Sure, let them have their own country.\n\n2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:30.080\n So it's two countries.\n\n2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:33.200\n One has Joe Rogan, the other one has the New York Times.\n\n2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:34.780\n That's basically what's happening right now.\n\n2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:40.320\n It just geographically doesn't map out very well, but culturally, yes.\n\n2:44:40.320 --> 2:44:41.600\n But that's just cultural stuff.\n\n2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:43.400\n Like there's a layer of public discourse.\n\n2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:44.400\n Okay.\n\n2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:48.040\n I don't mean like that's what we're operating under now, but there's actual like progress\n\n2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:53.160\n being made, like roads being built, hospitals being run, all those kinds of things like\n\n2:44:53.160 --> 2:44:55.260\n different innovations.\n\n2:44:55.260 --> 2:44:59.080\n That seems like secession is counterproductive to that.\n\n2:44:59.080 --> 2:45:01.720\n Right, because one country would have all the roads and the other would have all the\n\n2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:02.720\n hospitals.\n\n2:45:02.720 --> 2:45:03.720\n That's a great point.\n\n2:45:03.720 --> 2:45:05.440\n No, that's not, that's not the point I'm trying to make.\n\n2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:10.720\n It's just like, it just feels like the division that we're experiencing in the space of ideas\n\n2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:17.360\n could be constructive and productive for, for building better roads and better hospitals\n\n2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:21.480\n as opposed to like using that division to separate the countries.\n\n2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:25.760\n They're all going to have to solve the same problems, it feels like.\n\n2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:28.680\n Sure but they can solve them differently and compete that way.\n\n2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:30.160\n Mass is a great example.\n\n2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:31.160\n Yeah.\n\n2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:32.160\n We're seeing that right now.\n\n2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:34.600\n Different countries have different mass mandates and things like this.\n\n2:45:34.600 --> 2:45:39.920\n And the competition within the same structure, within the same founding documents and same\n\n2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:42.480\n institutions is not effective, you think?\n\n2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:43.480\n As effective as separating.\n\n2:45:43.480 --> 2:45:48.160\n It is effective but there is a certain point, which I think we have long passed, where there\n\n2:45:48.160 --> 2:45:51.920\n is not a governing consensus ideologically or culturally.\n\n2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:54.200\n Let me ask you a fun question, okay?\n\n2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:55.200\n Knock knock.\n\n2:45:55.200 --> 2:45:56.200\n Who's there?\n\n2:45:56.200 --> 2:45:57.200\n Mars.\n\n2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:03.560\n God of war.\n\n2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:06.100\n The other one.\n\n2:46:06.100 --> 2:46:07.100\n The planet.\n\n2:46:07.100 --> 2:46:08.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:08.100 --> 2:46:17.280\n So, there is a kind of captivating notion that we might, I'm excited by it, the human\n\n2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:19.520\n being stepping foot on Mars.\n\n2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:30.400\n That to me is, it's like one of those things that feels like it's, why do we want to engage\n\n2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:32.920\n in space exploration?\n\n2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:39.360\n But I'm a little bit with Elon Musk on this, which is, it's obvious that eventually if\n\n2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:45.720\n human species is to survive, it's going to have to innovate in ways that includes the\n\n2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:46.720\n space.\n\n2:46:46.720 --> 2:46:47.720\n Okay.\n\n2:46:47.720 --> 2:46:53.440\n Like, there's a lot of things we're not able to predict yet that if we push ourselves to\n\n2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:59.120\n the limits of space, like new ideas will come that'll be obvious a hundred years from now\n\n2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:01.560\n and then we're not even imagining now.\n\n2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:07.200\n And colonizing Mars, that idea that seems ridiculous, exceptionally difficult, impossibly\n\n2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:14.120\n expensive is something that is actually going to be seen as obvious in retrospect and that\n\n2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:15.120\n we should engage in.\n\n2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:16.120\n Okay.\n\n2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:18.520\n That's just to contextualize things.\n\n2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:27.340\n The fun idea and experiment from a philosophical and political sense is what kind of government,\n\n2:47:27.340 --> 2:47:32.680\n how do you orchestrate a government when you go to Mars, like we don't get too many chances\n\n2:47:32.680 --> 2:47:39.480\n like this, but how do you build new systems, not in place of old ones, but in a place with\n\n2:47:39.480 --> 2:47:41.740\n no system previous have existed?\n\n2:47:41.740 --> 2:47:45.520\n I think organically, I hate that word, but that's the correct word.\n\n2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:48.560\n You would have to figure out, I mean, that's how America was built.\n\n2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:52.120\n You had the, it was a Jamestown colony and they tried to do communism here and it completely\n\n2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:55.620\n failed and they went to a more free market system with the second wave of colonists is\n\n2:47:55.620 --> 2:47:57.420\n my understanding.\n\n2:47:57.420 --> 2:48:04.120\n For Mars, I mean, it depends on the population, who the population was, the number of people.\n\n2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:05.660\n I don't know.\n\n2:48:05.660 --> 2:48:10.860\n These are all kind of hypotheticals that I don't really have any good insight in whatsoever.\n\n2:48:10.860 --> 2:48:12.080\n I'm not a space person.\n\n2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:13.080\n I hate astronomy.\n\n2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:14.720\n Like I hate it.\n\n2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:18.020\n So a lot of people look up to the stars and they're filled with awe and wonder about the\n\n2:48:18.020 --> 2:48:22.640\n mystery of the universe and you look up to the stars and you feel what?\n\n2:48:22.640 --> 2:48:23.640\n I'm not looking up.\n\n2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:25.440\n I'm looking at the earth.\n\n2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:33.000\n If you look at what's, I'd much rather given a choice between Mars and the deep sea.\n\n2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:36.440\n I'd much rather spend a week at the deep sea and all the life forms that are down there\n\n2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:38.480\n because they're literal aliens.\n\n2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:41.760\n It's like things that are not literal, but they're unimaginable to us.\n\n2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:42.920\n Some of the things down there.\n\n2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:43.920\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:47.640\n To me, it's an interesting thought experiment to see when you have 10 people, when you have\n\n2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:53.520\n a hundred people, how do you build an effective, you know, this is actually really useful for\n\n2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:54.520\n a company, right?\n\n2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:57.960\n How do you build an effective company that does things?\n\n2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:02.360\n It's not an obvious, despite everybody being really certain about everything in this, in\n\n2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:07.040\n this modern world, to me, it's not obvious, like how do you run successfully as a group\n\n2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:08.040\n of people?\n\n2:49:08.040 --> 2:49:09.040\n I agree.\n\n2:49:09.040 --> 2:49:10.040\n I agree.\n\n2:49:10.040 --> 2:49:11.040\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n2:49:11.040 --> 2:49:15.140\n It also organic means you have to look at who the people are and tailor the organization\n\n2:49:15.140 --> 2:49:17.640\n to them as opposed to try to impose something.\n\n2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:19.520\n But you get to also select people.\n\n2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:20.520\n Right.\n\n2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:22.280\n Cause it's not going to be open borders on Mars.\n\n2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:23.880\n Oh, right.\n\n2:49:23.880 --> 2:49:27.320\n I was going to say when you have one country, it's all open borders.\n\n2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:28.320\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:32.160\n They're from outer space, right?\n\n2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:33.720\n Some say they're aliens already there.\n\n2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:35.360\n So you're going to have to negotiate that.\n\n2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:36.360\n Sure.\n\n2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:37.360\n We're aliens.\n\n2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:38.880\n So we're aliens to somebody.\n\n2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:39.880\n We're legal aliens.\n\n2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:42.560\n Do you think there's alien civilizations out there?\n\n2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:43.560\n Yes.\n\n2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:44.560\n Of course.\n\n2:49:44.560 --> 2:49:48.080\n What do you think is their system of government anarchism?\n\n2:49:48.080 --> 2:49:51.160\n Cause they're advanced.\n\n2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:53.200\n Do you honestly think there's intelligent life forms out there?\n\n2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:54.200\n Of course.\n\n2:49:54.200 --> 2:49:55.200\n It's the math.\n\n2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:56.200\n It's impossible that there isn't.\n\n2:49:56.200 --> 2:50:03.120\n So what do you make of all the stories of UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff?\n\n2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:05.320\n Do you think they've visited earth?\n\n2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:06.560\n Yes.\n\n2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:10.700\n My grandfather was an air traffic controller in the Soviet Union and he said they would\n\n2:50:10.700 --> 2:50:17.080\n often see these things that were not operating the way we knew vehicles operate.\n\n2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:18.800\n So that's good enough for me.\n\n2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:23.880\n So I mean, do you think government is in possession of some, like, what do you think government\n\n2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:26.160\n is doing with this kind of information?\n\n2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:36.040\n Do you think somebody has any understanding of UFO sightings or any kind of information\n\n2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:41.520\n about extraterrestrial life forms that are not known to the public?\n\n2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:42.520\n Yes.\n\n2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:43.520\n That's indisputably true.\n\n2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:48.360\n I think the fact that so many of these sightings are from aerodynamic professionals, like\n\n2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:53.080\n pilots and things of that nature, they are people who've seen it all, who are reputable.\n\n2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:58.720\n If they are on record saying, I've seen things that don't make sense, and both the Russians\n\n2:50:58.720 --> 2:51:03.160\n and the Americans thought it was the other one, that says something.\n\n2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:04.880\n Shouldn't that be a bigger problem?\n\n2:51:04.880 --> 2:51:09.520\n Shouldn't that be bigger news and a bigger problem if government is in fact hiding it?\n\n2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:13.360\n I guess, but like, what are they going to do with that information?\n\n2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:14.360\n It's a good question.\n\n2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:22.200\n Like, if a UFO, if an extraterrestrial spacecraft, which most likely would be like a crappy space,\n\n2:51:22.200 --> 2:51:28.080\n like it wouldn't be the actual aliens, it would be like some drone probe ship.\n\n2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:29.080\n AI.\n\n2:51:29.080 --> 2:51:30.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:31.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:31.080 --> 2:51:32.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:33.280\n So if that, like, what would you do with that information?\n\n2:51:33.280 --> 2:51:41.520\n As somebody that's in charge of, you know, like you see how badly WHO fumbled the discussion\n\n2:51:41.520 --> 2:51:42.520\n of masks.\n\n2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:43.520\n Masks?\n\n2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:44.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:44.520 --> 2:51:45.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:45.520 --> 2:51:47.560\n Masks is one of them, but everything really in terms of communicating with the public\n\n2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:51.040\n honestly about what they know, what they don't know.\n\n2:51:51.040 --> 2:51:53.040\n And that's a trivial one.\n\n2:51:53.040 --> 2:51:54.040\n Right.\n\n2:51:54.040 --> 2:51:58.080\n I don't, I don't, I don't know.\n\n2:51:58.080 --> 2:52:03.600\n There certainly feel incompetent at being able to communicate effectively with the public\n\n2:52:03.600 --> 2:52:11.320\n about something much more difficult, much more full of mystery, like a UFO, a thing,\n\n2:52:11.320 --> 2:52:14.120\n a piece of material that's out of this earth.\n\n2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:17.760\n Forget like organic material.\n\n2:52:17.760 --> 2:52:19.400\n I don't, I don't know.\n\n2:52:19.400 --> 2:52:22.520\n To me, I just, so from a scientist perspective, it would be beautiful.\n\n2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:25.680\n It would be inspiring to reveal this to the world.\n\n2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:29.000\n Here's the mystery and make it completely public.\n\n2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:30.000\n Share it with China.\n\n2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:31.000\n Share it with everybody.\n\n2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:35.120\n I think there is a domino effect where the concern would be what else are you hiding\n\n2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:36.120\n from us?\n\n2:52:36.120 --> 2:52:39.160\n And at that point, if you said, no, no, no, this is everything, people wouldn't believe\n\n2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:43.080\n you and they would, you can't blame them for not believing them.\n\n2:52:43.080 --> 2:52:45.800\n Ah, yeah.\n\n2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:46.800\n And then it'd be like, show us the aliens.\n\n2:52:46.800 --> 2:52:47.800\n They'd be like, we don't have them.\n\n2:52:47.800 --> 2:52:48.800\n We just have the craft.\n\n2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:50.800\n You're lying.\n\n2:52:50.800 --> 2:52:55.920\n Speaking of aliens, offline, you mentioned elves.\n\n2:52:55.920 --> 2:52:57.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:58.000\n And psychedelics.\n\n2:52:58.000 --> 2:52:59.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:09.080\n What do you think about psychedelics in terms of the kind of places that can take your mind?\n\n2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:11.640\n The kind of journey it can take you on.\n\n2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:17.880\n Like what do you think, what do you think the psychedelics do to the human mind and\n\n2:53:17.880 --> 2:53:22.660\n what does that say about the capacity of the human mind and just in general, like the mysteries\n\n2:53:22.660 --> 2:53:23.660\n of all that's out there?\n\n2:53:23.660 --> 2:53:26.320\n I don't know that we understand what they do.\n\n2:53:26.320 --> 2:53:32.820\n The way I heard it explained to me is that much of the human mind isn't about receiving\n\n2:53:32.820 --> 2:53:36.080\n information but blocking information, right?\n\n2:53:36.080 --> 2:53:39.600\n Because we're so, there's so much data coming in any moment that you basically have to train\n\n2:53:39.600 --> 2:53:42.880\n yourself to see and to hear only what you want to see and to hear.\n\n2:53:42.880 --> 2:53:46.480\n And that what psychedelics do is they tear that away and suddenly you're much more aware\n\n2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:49.240\n of what's out there and also you're going to be noticing patterns that you hadn't noticed\n\n2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:50.240\n before.\n\n2:53:50.240 --> 2:53:56.160\n I know you had that researcher on the show and he kind of discussed this at some length.\n\n2:53:56.160 --> 2:54:01.200\n I mean, Rogan is probably the person who popularized DMT more than, well, he's obviously the person\n\n2:54:01.200 --> 2:54:03.840\n who's popularized DMT more than anything.\n\n2:54:03.840 --> 2:54:10.240\n I don't know anyone who had, even the researchers who have anything close to a coherent explanation\n\n2:54:10.240 --> 2:54:15.840\n of why this drug, which exists everywhere, would have this very specific, very extreme\n\n2:54:15.840 --> 2:54:21.320\n effect on so many people who are going to be experiencing such bizarre consequences\n\n2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:22.960\n as a result of it.\n\n2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:26.680\n I think it's very interesting that this is talking about the government, you know, the\n\n2:54:26.680 --> 2:54:33.320\n CIA started experimenting with LSD, they killed one of their own people, drove them to suicide\n\n2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:39.480\n and there was a lot of research into, Terrence McKenna talks about this, into this field\n\n2:54:39.480 --> 2:54:43.840\n and then very quickly, once it got into the mainstream, they shut it down, even though\n\n2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:47.400\n it's not addictive, it doesn't cause you to go crazy or anything like that and there was\n\n2:54:47.400 --> 2:54:52.560\n a lot of propaganda against its use, which I think, thankfully, is now somewhat receding.\n\n2:54:52.560 --> 2:54:56.400\n I think Colorado just legalized mushrooms, something like that and I think it'll be very\n\n2:54:56.400 --> 2:54:58.480\n interesting to see what happens as a result of this.\n\n2:54:58.480 --> 2:55:03.320\n Yeah, and the interesting thing is, there doesn't seem to be, for certain psychedelics\n\n2:55:03.320 --> 2:55:09.880\n like psilocybin, like mushrooms, there doesn't seem to be a lethal dose, which is fascinating,\n\n2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:17.280\n like Matthew Johnson, the Hopkins professor that you mentioned, I'm definitely going to\n\n2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:24.960\n do one of his studies, it's a really cool way to do what he calls a heroic dose of psilocybin.\n\n2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:27.320\n Oh, I want to do it, what do I have to do?\n\n2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:28.320\n Let's do it.\n\n2:55:28.320 --> 2:55:32.440\n A heroic dose, holy crap.\n\n2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:36.560\n Yeah, but it's safe.\n\n2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:37.840\n How many grams are we talking?\n\n2:55:37.840 --> 2:55:41.400\n I don't know, but it's just, it's big.\n\n2:55:41.400 --> 2:55:42.400\n He says that...\n\n2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:45.400\n This is going to have a kick.\n\n2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:46.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:51.800\n He says that, I mean, he also studies cocaine, he studies all kinds of drugs and he's like,\n\n2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:52.800\n the psilocybin is...\n\n2:55:52.800 --> 2:55:55.680\n A heroic dose of cocaine kills you.\n\n2:55:55.680 --> 2:56:01.080\n You can't, so you can't even come close, so he says the problem with studying cocaine\n\n2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:08.200\n is you have people who are addicted to cocaine or war or so on, you give them the kind of\n\n2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:14.520\n doses that we can and part of the study is like, it's nothing to them.\n\n2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:22.280\n Psilocybin is the only one where even daily users or regular users are blown away by the\n\n2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:25.160\n dose they give them.\n\n2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:35.160\n So you can go to Russia in your mind, you can go to outer space, maybe you'll become\n\n2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:39.240\n an astronaut or astronomer after all.\n\n2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:42.080\n Maybe I'll be Baba Yaga.\n\n2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:46.760\n I'll let people look that one up.\n\n2:56:46.760 --> 2:56:50.360\n What is love?\n\n2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:57.280\n What do you think this thing is like our attachment to other human beings?\n\n2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:00.200\n And is it something that we should give to just a few people?\n\n2:57:00.200 --> 2:57:01.960\n Yes, that's for sure.\n\n2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:07.440\n When I was working with DL Hughley in his book, he didn't use the term, but he was describing\n\n2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:10.000\n like low key depression.\n\n2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:15.120\n And he talked about how he was in the airport and he noticed a girl had a red dress and\n\n2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:17.680\n he went up and thanked her and she was like, what are you thanking for?\n\n2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.040\n And he had realized he hadn't registered color in like weeks.\n\n2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:28.800\n And I think love is like that when you see someone and you just like, oh, like your eyes\n\n2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:29.800\n are open.\n\n2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:34.260\n Like this is something I've never seen before or I want more of this, that kind of thing.\n\n2:57:34.260 --> 2:57:40.920\n It really disorients and reorients your thinking.\n\n2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:45.360\n Don't you find that like the world is full of that like nonstop?\n\n2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:47.040\n It's not just like a person either.\n\n2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:48.040\n It's like...\n\n2:57:48.040 --> 2:57:53.320\n Yes, but when it's in a person, it's a whole other level because it's like, I could have,\n\n2:57:53.320 --> 2:57:55.060\n this is going to be great for years.\n\n2:57:55.060 --> 2:57:57.760\n It's like, you know, every day it's something new.\n\n2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:00.560\n I mean, that is, and that is rare.\n\n2:58:00.560 --> 2:58:01.560\n You think it's rare?\n\n2:58:01.560 --> 2:58:02.560\n I mean...\n\n2:58:02.560 --> 2:58:06.120\n Find someone who you could talk to them for years and not run out of things to talk to.\n\n2:58:06.120 --> 2:58:07.120\n Oh, that's true for years.\n\n2:58:07.120 --> 2:58:08.120\n Yes.\n\n2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:09.120\n Yes.\n\n2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:10.120\n That's rare.\n\n2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:14.440\n And know that they really, if you leave the room, they will do right by you.\n\n2:58:14.440 --> 2:58:16.040\n That's really rare.\n\n2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:27.080\n Well, from a Russian perspective, you just don't give them another choice.\n\n2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:33.780\n This is Tavadish New Year, New Year's Eve.\n\n2:58:33.780 --> 2:58:41.080\n So you talked about secession and the world burning down and you holding the match at\n\n2:58:41.080 --> 2:58:44.160\n the end, standing with a big smile on your face.\n\n2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:45.160\n Yes.\n\n2:58:45.160 --> 2:58:47.520\n I was serious.\n\n2:58:47.520 --> 2:58:54.940\n But let me ask you, if it doesn't include flame and secession and destruction and laughing\n\n2:58:54.940 --> 2:59:01.600\n malice and makeup and a white suit at the end, how do we bring more kindness and love\n\n2:59:01.600 --> 2:59:03.680\n to the world in 2021?\n\n2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:05.040\n Oh, easy.\n\n2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:09.480\n Be comfortable saying, I want to be happy.\n\n2:59:09.480 --> 2:59:16.200\n And if there's someone who interjects and gives you attitude, arms lengthen.\n\n2:59:16.200 --> 2:59:19.600\n Surround yourself with people who also want to be happy.\n\n2:59:19.600 --> 2:59:21.000\n Here's a great example.\n\n2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:25.880\n My buddy Chris Williamson, who I've mentioned before, he's a podcaster, does Modern Wisdom.\n\n2:59:25.880 --> 2:59:30.240\n He's an awesome dude and we became very close friends this past year.\n\n2:59:30.240 --> 2:59:35.720\n And he was in Dubai recently and he sent me pics from Dubai by the pool, just loving life.\n\n2:59:35.720 --> 2:59:41.840\n And it took me a week and then it clicked in my head and I'm like, you know what?\n\n2:59:41.840 --> 2:59:48.260\n For some other people, if they saw him under remodel at the pool, they would think this\n\n2:59:48.260 --> 2:59:50.840\n is him bragging or humble bragging.\n\n2:59:50.840 --> 2:59:51.920\n And that never entered my head.\n\n2:59:51.920 --> 2:59:58.480\n I'm like, oh man, I'm so glad my boy can be having a good time and is sharing his joy\n\n2:59:58.480 --> 2:59:59.960\n with me.\n\n2:59:59.960 --> 3:00:03.040\n That's the kind of people you need to surround yourself with, where it never enters their\n\n3:00:03.040 --> 3:00:10.960\n head to be resentful or anything other than sharing in your bounty.\n\n3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:12.880\n What makes you happy?\n\n3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:15.320\n I'm happy all the time.\n\n3:00:15.320 --> 3:00:19.440\n And one of the points I made in my life is like, I really hated, I really did not like\n\n3:00:19.440 --> 3:00:24.400\n to give advice because I feel don't give advice until you know what you're talking about.\n\n3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:27.440\n And to me, what makes me happy is being self actualized.\n\n3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:34.200\n I am in a position with my career where I could be myself 24 seven, where I never have\n\n3:00:34.200 --> 3:00:39.300\n to engage in small talk, where I never have to interact with someone I don't want to.\n\n3:00:39.300 --> 3:00:41.440\n And I'm very blessed to have that.\n\n3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:42.980\n Very few people have that.\n\n3:00:42.980 --> 3:00:51.320\n And to have that be not only, to have that be like rewarded and having people find that\n\n3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:55.240\n something of value to them makes me very, very happy.\n\n3:00:55.240 --> 3:00:58.600\n But also being an uncle, I have two little nephews.\n\n3:00:58.600 --> 3:01:01.400\n They make me very, very happy.\n\n3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:05.280\n Sure my sister's raising them Russian, so they talk like immigrants, but that's okay.\n\n3:01:05.280 --> 3:01:06.280\n We're going to change that.\n\n3:01:06.280 --> 3:01:09.040\n We have to dismember her, that's fine.\n\n3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:10.040\n That makes me happy.\n\n3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:17.240\n And to be able to finish this book and know it's going to give people a sense of hope,\n\n3:01:17.240 --> 3:01:20.280\n that's really validating.\n\n3:01:20.280 --> 3:01:25.720\n What are you most grateful for

that I can come in here not knowing what we're going to talk about\n\n3:01:38.280 --> 3:01:44.020\n and know it's not going to be something I have to be on guard about, or I have to watch\n\n3:01:44.020 --> 3:01:53.160\n my words and that neither you or your audience is going to be responding derisively.\n\n3:01:53.160 --> 3:01:55.280\n I feel safe here.\n\n3:01:55.280 --> 3:01:56.280\n You're welcome.\n\n3:01:56.280 --> 3:01:57.280\n Vaseva.\n\n3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:01.460\n Thanks for talking to me Michael, that was awesome.\n\n3:02:01.460 --> 3:02:06.160\n Thank you
