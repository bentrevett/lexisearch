  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.000\n The following is a conversation with Stephen Pressfield,\n\n00:03.000 --> 00:06.000\n author of several powerful nonfiction\n\n00:06.000 --> 00:10.120\n and historical fiction books, including The War of Art,\n\n00:10.120 --> 00:12.920\n a book that had a big impact on my life\n\n00:12.920 --> 00:15.240\n and the life of millions of people\n\n00:15.240 --> 00:20.000\n whose passion is to create in art, science, business,\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:22.720\n sport, and everywhere else.\n\n00:22.720 --> 00:26.840\n I highly recommend it and others of his books on this topic,\n\n00:26.840 --> 00:30.480\n including Turning Pro, Do the Work,\n\n00:30.480 --> 00:35.400\n Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit, and The Warrior Ethos.\n\n00:35.400 --> 00:38.440\n Also, his books Gets a Fire about the Spartans\n\n00:38.440 --> 00:42.640\n and the Battle of Thermopylae, The Lionsgate, Tides of War,\n\n00:42.640 --> 00:44.480\n and others are some of the best\n\n00:44.480 --> 00:47.440\n historical fiction novels ever written.\n\n00:48.600 --> 00:50.800\n As some of you know, I don't shy away\n\n00:50.800 --> 00:53.640\n from taking on a big, difficult challenge.\n\n00:53.640 --> 00:56.920\n One of the hardest for me and for millions of others\n\n00:56.920 --> 01:01.560\n is the discipline of staring at an empty page every day,\n\n01:01.560 --> 01:04.840\n pushing on to think deeply, to create,\n\n01:04.840 --> 01:07.400\n despite the millions of excuses that fill the head.\n\n01:08.360 --> 01:11.800\n In his work, Stephen has articulated this struggle\n\n01:11.800 --> 01:14.120\n better than anyone I've ever read.\n\n01:15.040 --> 01:16.600\n Quick summary of the ads.\n\n01:16.600 --> 01:21.400\n Two sponsors, The Jordan Harbinger Show and Cash App.\n\n01:21.400 --> 01:23.160\n Please consider supporting the podcast\n\n01:23.160 --> 01:26.200\n by going to jordanharbinger.com slash lex\n\n01:27.160 -->

stuff.\n\n01:37.200 --> 01:40.520\n It really is the best way to support this podcast.\n\n01:40.520 --> 01:43.760\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:43.760 --> 01:46.400\n I recently considered renaming this podcast\n\n01:46.400 --> 01:48.080\n but decided against it.\n\n01:48.080 --> 01:51.200\n AI is my passion, and in some sense,\n\n01:51.200 --> 01:53.560\n this podcast is not as much about AI\n\n01:53.560 --> 01:56.000\n but more about a journey of an AI researcher\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:58.640\n struggling to explore the human mind,\n\n01:58.640 --> 02:00.280\n the physics of our universe,\n\n02:00.280 --> 02:02.320\n and the nature of human behavior,\n\n02:02.320 --> 02:07.240\n intelligence, consciousness, love, and power.\n\n02:07.240 --> 02:09.640\n I will continue to return home to the technical,\n\n02:09.640 --> 02:11.080\n computer science, machine learning,\n\n02:11.080 --> 02:12.920\n engineering, math, programming,\n\n02:12.920 --> 02:15.760\n but also venture out to talk to people\n\n02:15.760 --> 02:17.840\n who had a big impact on my life\n\n02:17.840 --> 02:19.880\n outside the technical fields.\n\n02:19.880 --> 02:24.120\n Writers like Steven Pressfield and Stephen King,\n\n02:24.120 --> 02:26.520\n musicians like Tom Waits,\n\n02:26.520 --> 02:30.560\n political leaders like, well, you know who,\n\n02:31.520 --> 02:32.680\n and even athletes.\n\n02:33.720 --> 02:36.040\n I hope you join me on this journey.\n\n02:36.040 --> 02:38.360\n As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now\n\n02:38.360 --> 02:39.520\n and no ads in the middle\n\n02:39.520 --> 02:41.760\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n02:41.760 --> 02:44.520\n Click on the links, buy all of the stuff.\n\n02:44.520 --> 02:46.880\n It's the best way to support this podcast.\n\n02:46.880 --> 02:50.880\n This episode is supported by the Jordan Harbinger Show.\n\n02:50.880 --> 02:53.840\n Go to jordanharbinger.com slash Lex.\n\n02:53.840 -->

else.\n\n03:00.840 --> 03:02.920\n I've been binging on this podcast.\n\n03:02.920 --> 03:05.480\n Jordan is a great human being.\n\n03:05.480 --> 03:07.200\n He gets the best out of his guests,\n\n03:07.200 --> 03:10.080\n dives deep, calls them out when it's needed,\n\n03:10.080 --> 03:12.360\n and makes the whole thing fun to listen to.\n\n03:12.360 --> 03:15.400\n He's interviewed Kobe Bryant, Mark Cuban,\n\n03:15.400 --> 03:18.960\n Neil deGrasse Tyson, Gary Kasparov, and many more.\n\n03:18.960 --> 03:21.200\n I just finished listening to his recent conversation\n\n03:21.200 --> 03:24.920\n with Mick West about debunking conspiracy theories.\n\n03:24.920 --> 03:28.400\n This topic can be both fascinating and frustrating\n\n03:28.400 --> 03:31.320\n on both sides, but in this conversation,\n\n03:31.320 --> 03:33.400\n Jordan thread the needle beautifully,\n\n03:33.400 --> 03:35.840\n and so it turned out to be a great listen.\n\n03:35.840 --> 03:37.800\n I highly recommend it.\n\n03:37.800 --> 03:40.880\n Again, go to jordanharbinger.com slash Lex.\n\n03:40.880 --> 03:42.840\n It's how he knows I sent you.\n\n03:42.840 --> 03:45.760\n On that page, there's links to subscribe to this show\n\n03:45.760 --> 03:49.680\n on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and everywhere else.\n\n03:49.680 --> 03:51.880\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n03:51.880 --> 03:54.480\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n03:54.480 --> 03:58.000\n When you get it, use code LexPodcast.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.920\n Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,\n\n04:00.920 --> 04:04.320\n and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.\n\n04:04.320 --> 04:06.520\n Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,\n\n04:06.520 --> 04:08.480\n let me mention that the cryptocurrency\n\n04:08.480 --> 04:11.960\n in the context of the history of money is fascinating.\n\n04:11.960 --> 04:16.080\n I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.\n\n04:16.080 --> 04:18.480\n Debits and credits on ledgers started\n\n04:18.480 --> 04:20.720\n around 30,000 years ago.\n\n04:20.720 --> 04:23.800\n The US dollar created over 200 years ago,\n\n04:23.800 --> 04:26.040\n and the first decentralized cryptocurrency\n\n04:26.040 --> 04:28.320\n released just over 10 years ago.\n\n04:28.320 --> 04:31.240\n So given that history, cryptocurrency's still very much\n\n04:31.240 --> 04:33.440\n in its early days of development,\n\n04:33.440 --> 04:34.880\n but it's still aiming to,\n\n04:34.880 --> 04:37.840\n and just might redefine the nature of money.\n\n04:38.840 --> 04:41.480\n So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store\n\n04:41.480 --> 04:44.840\n or Google Play, and use the code LexPodcast,\n\n04:44.840 --> 04:49.000\n you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.320\n an organization that is helping advance robotics\n\n04:51.320 --> 04:54.080\n and STEM education for young people around the world.\n\n04:55.200 --> 04:59.360\n And now, here's my conversation with Steven Pressfield.\n\n05:00.520 --> 05:03.240\n Modern society in many ways dreams\n\n05:03.240 --> 05:05.320\n of creating universal peace,\n\n05:06.200 --> 05:08.880\n and yet war has molded civilization\n\n05:08.880 --> 05:10.760\n as we know it throughout its history.\n\n05:10.760 --> 05:15.760\n So let's start at the high philosophical level.\n\n05:16.280 --> 05:18.800\n If you could imagine a world without war,\n\n05:18.800 --> 05:20.440\n how would that world be different?\n\n05:20.440 --> 05:24.800\n Perhaps put another way, what purpose has war served?\n\n05:25.920 --> 05:27.400\n Why do we fight?\n\n05:27.400 --> 05:31.760\n I think we're basically the same creatures internally\n\n05:31.760 --> 05:34.440\n that we were in the cave, right?\n\n05:34.440 --> 05:39.440\n In tribal society, back for however many,\n\n05:39.440 --> 05:41.840\n you know, hundreds of thousands, millions of years,\n\n05:41.840 --> 05:46.720\n which means that we're in the dynamic in our mind\n\n05:46.720 --> 05:48.960\n is a kind of an us versus them dynamic\n\n05:48.960 --> 05:52.000\n where our tribe is the people,\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.760\n and everybody else are whatever, you know?\n\n05:54.760 --> 05:57.000\n And I don't see that,\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.520\n I don't think that's changed one iota over the centuries.\n\n06:01.520 --> 06:06.360\n It's just a question of how one might sublimate\n\n06:06.360 --> 06:10.120\n that urge to compete.\n\n06:10.120 --> 06:12.760\n When you're a martial artist, you know,\n\n06:12.760 --> 06:14.960\n a great part of your day I'm sure is dedicated\n\n06:14.960 --> 06:19.960\n to reaching that place of total commitment\n\n06:21.360 --> 06:23.280\n and in the face of competition,\n\n06:23.280 --> 06:25.120\n in the face of adversity, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n06:25.120 --> 06:28.920\n which is, I think, natural and great for the human race\n\n06:28.920 --> 06:30.960\n on an individual basis.\n\n06:30.960 --> 06:35.680\n So the hope that I have, if there is any hope,\n\n06:35.680 --> 06:37.040\n personally, I don't think the human race\n\n06:37.040 --> 06:38.920\n is gonna be around very long,\n\n06:38.920 --> 06:43.920\n but would be in sports\n\n06:43.920 --> 06:47.480\n or in other kind of sublimated activities\n\n06:47.480 --> 06:51.560\n where people can act out their need for conquest\n\n06:51.560 --> 06:53.200\n or aggression or so forth,\n\n06:53.200 --> 06:56.080\n but at the same time relate to their opponents\n\n06:56.080 --> 06:58.360\n as human beings, and when the game is over,\n\n06:58.360 --> 07:01.320\n you know, you embrace your competitors, stuff like that.\n\n07:01.320 --> 07:06.320\n So you think war was inevitable, it's a part of human nature\n\n07:06.840 --> 07:11.840\n as opposed to a force, a creative force in society\n\n07:11.960 --> 07:14.160\n that served a benefit.\n\n07:14.160 --> 07:17.280\n Well, I'm sure it has benefited, you know,\n\n07:17.280 --> 07:21.000\n spreading cultures and mixing cultures and stuff like that,\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:26.000\n but I think the urge to conquest,\n\n07:26.440 --> 07:28.040\n if you think about Alexander the Great\n\n07:28.040 --> 07:30.360\n or Julius Caesar or Napoleon or anybody like that,\n\n07:30.360 --> 07:33.080\n or even individual, or if we even think about\n\n07:33.080 --> 07:36.240\n one of the plants that we're looking at right outside,\n\n07:36.240 --> 07:39.120\n I mean, if you let a particular plant have its way,\n\n07:39.120 --> 07:41.520\n it would take over, you know, the whole hillside.\n\n07:41.520 --> 07:46.520\n And certainly in the days of Alexander the Great, let's say,\n\n07:47.080 --> 07:50.760\n there were, who knows, over the face of the earth,\n\n07:50.760 --> 07:54.240\n hundreds of little kingdoms, China, Japan,\n\n07:54.240 --> 07:56.480\n you know, Asia, Europe, wherever,\n\n07:56.480 --> 08:01.480\n and every prince that grew up dreamt of conquering\n\n08:01.960 --> 08:04.580\n his neighbor and conquering a neighbor after that.\n\n08:04.580 --> 08:09.580\n That seems to be a universal human imperative,\n\n08:11.120 --> 08:14.040\n at least in the male of the species.\n\n08:14.040 --> 08:14.880\n So...\n\n08:14.880 --> 08:16.920\n The war is just a realization of that imperative.\n\n08:16.920 --> 08:18.320\n I think so.\n\n08:18.320 --> 08:22.120\n So you've written about Spartans in the Battle of Thermopylae,\n\n08:22.120 --> 08:23.520\n you've about Alexander the Great,\n\n08:23.520 --> 08:26.420\n about the Six Day War in 67 in Israel,\n\n08:28.160 --> 08:30.360\n against Egypt, Jordan, Syria.\n\n08:30.360 --> 08:35.280\n What war, not just out of those, but in general,\n\n08:35.280 --> 08:38.880\n do you think has been most transformative for the world?\n\n08:38.880 --> 08:40.680\n Well, these are great questions, Lex.\n\n08:40.680 --> 08:42.560\n Tough, easy ones, right?\n\n08:42.560 --> 08:47.120\n I mean, I wish I knew more about the Mongols,\n\n08:47.120 --> 08:49.660\n because I certainly, from what little I know,\n\n08:49.660 --> 08:51.360\n I think that was a very,\n\n08:51.360 --> 08:54.200\n their conquests were very transformative,\n\n08:54.200 --> 08:59.200\n bringing cultures in a horrible, bloody way together.\n\n09:00.520 --> 09:05.180\n But gosh, what's then the most transformative?\n\n09:05.180 --> 09:07.480\n Maybe the Roman conquest,\n\n09:07.480 --> 09:10.680\n establishing the Roman Empire and bringing that culture.\n\n09:10.680 --> 09:13.680\n Maybe Alexander the Great's wars\n\n09:13.680 --> 09:18.680\n that united east and west, at least for a minute.\n\n09:19.280 --> 09:20.760\n So building of empire.\n\n09:20.760 --> 09:23.680\n Do you have a sense, so there's wars,\n\n09:23.680 --> 09:28.680\n I mean, the Six Day War is not about building empires.\n\n09:30.280 --> 09:35.280\n It's about deeply held religious, cultural conflict\n\n09:39.180 --> 09:42.680\n and holding the line, holding the border.\n\n09:42.680 --> 09:45.400\n And then there is conquests, like the Mongols,\n\n09:45.400 --> 09:48.800\n that, what is it, some large percentage of the population\n\n09:48.800 --> 09:52.240\n is a descendant of Genghis Khan, I believe, right?\n\n09:52.240 --> 09:54.360\n So that has transformative effects.\n\n09:54.360 --> 09:56.800\n And then World War II, I mean, personally,\n\n09:56.800 --> 09:59.800\n and my family and so on, had transformative effects.\n\n09:59.800 --> 10:01.080\n Let me ask you this, Lex.\n\n10:01.080 --> 10:03.520\n Why are you, what are you trying to get at\n\n10:03.520 --> 10:04.880\n with these questions?\n\n10:04.880 --> 10:09.180\n What is this kind of the theme that you're aiming at?\n\n10:09.180 --> 10:11.680\n Well, I talked to Eric Weinstein,\n\n10:11.680 --> 10:13.800\n and he said everything is great about war\n\n10:13.800 --> 10:15.300\n except the killing.\n\n10:15.300 --> 10:20.300\n And there's a romantic notion of war.\n\n10:21.660 --> 10:23.920\n Certainly there's a romantic notion of being a warrior,\n\n10:23.920 --> 10:26.440\n but there's a romantic notion of war\n\n10:26.440 --> 10:31.080\n that somehow there's a creative force to it,\n\n10:32.200 --> 10:37.200\n that because we fight, out of that fighting comes culture,\n\n10:37.280 --> 10:42.280\n comes music and art, and more and more desire to create\n\n10:42.280 --> 10:45.780\n with the societies that win.\n\n10:45.780 --> 10:50.780\n And to me, war is not just, hey, I have a stick\n\n10:51.020 --> 10:53.380\n and I want your land.\n\n10:53.380 --> 10:58.380\n It's some kind of, like it has echoes of the creative force\n\n11:02.420 --> 11:05.940\n that makes humans unique to other animals.\n\n11:05.940 --> 11:09.740\n Like, war is, it can't be just four people\n\n11:09.740 --> 11:11.620\n or 10 people or 100 people.\n\n11:11.620 --> 11:14.740\n You have to have thousands of people agreeing,\n\n11:14.740 --> 11:19.740\n usually thousands or more, for something so deeply\n\n11:20.500 --> 11:22.980\n that you would be willing to risk your own life.\n\n11:22.980 --> 11:24.940\n And there's a romantic notion to that.\n\n11:24.940 --> 11:27.500\n And because you've written so well and passionate\n\n11:27.500 --> 11:29.940\n about some of these, I wanted to see,\n\n11:29.940 --> 11:31.220\n because I don't have any answers,\n\n11:31.220 --> 11:32.780\n I wanted to untangle that.\n\n11:32.780 --> 11:37.780\n If there is a reason we fight that's more than just anger\n\n11:37.780 --> 11:42.780\n and hate and a way to conquer.\n\n11:43.280 --> 11:47.480\n Well, let me take it from a completely different side.\n\n11:47.480 --> 11:51.580\n I don't think that I, in writing about war,\n\n11:51.580 --> 11:55.240\n am really that interested in war per se.\n\n11:55.240 --> 11:57.460\n I'm more interested in the metaphor.\n\n11:58.400 --> 12:02.860\n I think for me, I'm really writing about my own internal\n\n12:02.860 --> 12:07.860\n war and the war against myself and against my own resistance,\n\n12:10.880 --> 12:13.440\n my own negativity, all of those things\n\n12:13.440 --> 12:18.440\n that spirituality would be the opposite of.\n\n12:20.320 --> 12:23.920\n So I'm not really an expert on war.\n\n12:23.920 --> 12:25.720\n It's not like talking to Jim Mattis\n\n12:25.720 --> 12:30.720\n or to Victor Davis Hanson or whatever. To me, the human being,\n\n12:37.840 --> 12:42.840\n we are spiritual beings in a physical envelope.\n\n12:43.080 --> 12:48.080\n And there's an automatic terrible tension within that.\n\n12:48.220 --> 12:53.140\n And which creates a war inside ourselves.\n\n12:53.140 --> 12:58.140\n So the outer war, when I think about the Israeli army\n\n12:58.640 --> 13:02.440\n standing up to, whatever, 10 to one odds\n\n13:02.440 --> 13:07.440\n or whatever it was, that is a metaphor to me\n\n13:07.600 --> 13:10.080\n of the fight we're fighting inside ourselves.\n\n13:10.080 --> 13:12.360\n For me, the six day war was, as you know,\n\n13:12.360 --> 13:15.600\n my feeling was it was about a return from exile.\n\n13:15.600 --> 13:19.480\n It was sort of the culmination of the reestablishment\n\n13:19.480 --> 13:22.040\n of the state of Israel, which had never really\n\n13:22.040 --> 13:24.840\n been completed because the holiest places\n\n13:24.840 --> 13:27.260\n of the Jewish people were in the hands of their enemies.\n\n13:27.260 --> 13:31.580\n So now, on the other hand, Alexander the Great's conquests,\n\n13:31.580 --> 13:34.280\n I think, were a whole other different scenario\n\n13:34.280 --> 13:38.680\n where the metaphor was that Alexander's father, Philip,\n\n13:39.520 --> 13:43.360\n I think created the First Nation, capital N Nation,\n\n13:43.360 --> 13:48.280\n and he created a sort of a pathway for these guys\n\n13:48.280 --> 13:53.280\n who were mountain men and basically barbarians,\n\n13:54.800 --> 13:59.720\n Macedonians, and by creating this army\n\n13:59.720 --> 14:03.440\n and this dream of conquering the world,\n\n14:03.440 --> 14:07.120\n which Alexander took to the, you know, really enacted,\n\n14:07.120 --> 14:10.080\n he gave them a way of rising out of themselves,\n\n14:10.080 --> 14:12.940\n of transcending themselves, not just individually,\n\n14:12.940 --> 14:14.040\n but as a people.\n\n14:14.040 --> 14:16.400\n So that would go along with what you're saying, Lex,\n\n14:16.400 --> 14:19.260\n of a certain creativity to it.\n\n14:20.840 --> 14:24.640\n But again, that's not, for whatever,\n\n14:24.640 --> 14:27.720\n and I'm just realizing this as I'm answering this,\n\n14:27.720 --> 14:29.380\n that's not really what's interesting to me\n\n14:29.380 --> 14:31.360\n about these stories.\n\n14:31.360 --> 14:34.580\n And the Spartans, what was a whole, at Thermopylae,\n\n14:34.580 --> 14:37.540\n that was a whole other kind of metaphor of war.\n\n14:37.540 --> 14:42.540\n That was a sort of a willingly going to one's own death\n\n14:42.540 --> 14:46.140\n for a greater cause, just like, to me,\n\n14:46.140 --> 14:49.340\n the Spartans at Thermopylae enacted as a group\n\n14:49.340 --> 14:52.220\n what Jesus Christ enacted as an individual,\n\n14:52.220 --> 14:57.220\n a sacrifice of their lives for the greater good.\n\n14:57.540 --> 14:58.900\n I don't know if that answers your question,\n\n14:58.900 --> 15:01.100\n but that's how I see it.\n\n15:01.100 --> 15:04.340\n I do feel like, you know, I get invited to speak\n\n15:04.340 --> 15:07.780\n to Marine Corps groups and things like that all the time,\n\n15:07.780 --> 15:10.580\n and I decline because I don't really feel\n\n15:10.580 --> 15:15.540\n like I'm a spokesman for the warrior class\n\n15:15.540 --> 15:17.140\n or anything like that.\n\n15:18.860 --> 15:22.980\n That's not what's interesting about it to me.\n\n15:24.860 --> 15:28.540\n But didn't you just say, with war as a metaphor,\n\n15:28.540 --> 15:33.180\n that we're all essentially, in various ways, warriors?\n\n15:33.180 --> 15:36.900\n If we think of it in terms of Jungian archetypes,\n\n15:36.900 --> 15:40.900\n and think of our life at least as males,\n\n15:40.900 --> 15:44.060\n and the earliest archetypes that kick in\n\n15:44.060 --> 15:46.540\n are the youth and the wanderer and the student\n\n15:46.540 --> 15:48.700\n and that kind of thing, and then at some point\n\n15:48.700 --> 15:52.180\n around age 15 to 20, whatever,\n\n15:52.180 --> 15:54.460\n the warrior archetype kicks in,\n\n15:54.460 --> 15:56.700\n and we want to play football, we want to do martial arts,\n\n15:56.700 --> 15:58.860\n we want to join the special forces,\n\n15:58.860 --> 16:00.340\n we want to hang out with our buddies,\n\n16:00.340 --> 16:03.140\n that's our great bond, we want to test ourselves\n\n16:03.140 --> 16:05.360\n against adversity and so on and so forth.\n\n16:05.360 --> 16:07.920\n But at some point, that archetype,\n\n16:07.920 --> 16:09.740\n we move beyond that archetype,\n\n16:09.740 --> 16:14.620\n and we become fathers and teachers and so on and so forth.\n\n16:14.620 --> 16:17.060\n And then there are many archetypes beyond that\n\n16:17.060 --> 16:18.380\n towards the end.\n\n16:18.380 --> 16:23.380\n So I'm interested in the warrior archetype,\n\n16:23.460 --> 16:27.460\n but not to the be all and end all of everything else.\n\n16:30.800 --> 16:34.780\n In my book, The Virtues of War, have you read that?\n\n16:34.780 --> 16:37.460\n Well, there's a character named Telamon,\n\n16:37.460 --> 16:39.460\n who's actually, it's a long story,\n\n16:39.460 --> 16:44.380\n but when he's with Alexander's army,\n\n16:44.380 --> 16:46.820\n and when they arrive in India,\n\n16:46.820 --> 16:51.820\n he becomes fascinated by the gymnosophists,\n\n16:51.860 --> 16:55.620\n the fakirs, the naked wise men, the yogis.\n\n16:55.620 --> 17:00.020\n And he says to Alexander that these guys\n\n17:00.020 --> 17:05.020\n are warriors beyond what we are, even though they do nothing\n\n17:06.380 --> 17:11.380\n because they are inside their own selves all day long.\n\n17:11.940 --> 17:14.700\n If we go to the Six Day War,\n\n17:17.400 --> 17:19.640\n you write about, in Lionsgate,\n\n17:19.640 --> 17:21.740\n you write about the Six Day War in Israel.\n\n17:22.900 --> 17:24.680\n I think of the wars you've written about\n\n17:24.680 --> 17:28.220\n as the one we're still in many ways in the midst of today.\n\n17:28.220 --> 17:29.540\n Yes.\n\n17:29.540 --> 17:34.540\n So what is at the core of that conflict in Israel?\n\n17:35.860 --> 17:37.860\n The Israeli Palestinian conflict?\n\n17:37.860 --> 17:40.820\n I mean, today it's the Israeli Palestinian conflict,\n\n17:40.820 --> 17:44.420\n but it echoes of the same conflict\n\n17:44.420 --> 17:47.340\n in that part of the world with Israel.\n\n17:47.340 --> 17:52.340\n What is, in your sense, the nature of that conflict?\n\n17:53.500 --> 17:55.060\n What can we learn about society\n\n17:55.060 --> 17:57.180\n and human nature from that conflict?\n\n17:57.180 --> 17:59.820\n That is one of the hottest conflicts\n\n17:59.820 --> 18:01.780\n that still goes on today.\n\n18:01.780 --> 18:04.700\n Well, when I was working on the Lionsgate\n\n18:04.700 --> 18:08.700\n about the Six Day War, I wrote in the introduction\n\n18:10.740 --> 18:14.180\n that this was not gonna be a multi sided story.\n\n18:14.180 --> 18:17.620\n I was taking it entirely, I'm a Jew,\n\n18:17.620 --> 18:20.140\n I identify with the Israeli people,\n\n18:20.140 --> 18:23.740\n I was gonna see it entirely from their side.\n\n18:23.740 --> 18:27.100\n So that's probably not what you're asking,\n\n18:27.100 --> 18:32.100\n but to me, the Six Day War and that whole,\n\n18:34.060 --> 18:35.780\n it's a piece of land that's holy\n\n18:35.780 --> 18:39.620\n to at least three religions and probably more.\n\n18:39.620 --> 18:43.760\n And from the Jewish point of view,\n\n18:43.760 --> 18:46.220\n it's where the state of Israel,\n\n18:46.220 --> 18:47.780\n it's where David founded Jerusalem,\n\n18:47.780 --> 18:50.700\n it's all where the 12 tribes were, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n18:50.700 --> 18:52.900\n where Moses came and brought the people.\n\n18:52.900 --> 18:57.900\n So to me, the Six Day War was about,\n\n18:58.820 --> 19:00.780\n as I said, a return from exile,\n\n19:00.780 --> 19:03.380\n from diaspora after 2000 years.\n\n19:03.380 --> 19:06.580\n Now, obviously, from the Palestinian point of view\n\n19:06.580 --> 19:09.340\n or the Saudi Arabian point of view or whatever,\n\n19:09.340 --> 19:12.060\n it's a whole other scenario.\n\n19:12.060 --> 19:14.980\n Religion is at the core of this conflict in some ways,\n\n19:14.980 --> 19:15.980\n but religious beliefs.\n\n19:15.980 --> 19:20.980\n Religion and racial slash ethnic tribal identity.\n\n19:20.980 --> 19:23.060\n I mean, again, what is a Jew?\n\n19:23.060 --> 19:26.220\n Is a Jew somebody that believes in the religion\n\n19:26.220 --> 19:28.380\n or is it somebody of a certain race\n\n19:28.380 --> 19:31.700\n that race arose in a certain place?\n\n19:31.700 --> 19:32.740\n Same thing as a Muslim.\n\n19:32.740 --> 19:33.580\n What is a Muslim?\n\n19:33.580 --> 19:36.200\n Do they believe in Muhammad or whatever?\n\n19:37.260 --> 19:40.500\n Or did they arise in a certain place and a certain ethnicity?\n\n19:40.500 --> 19:43.020\n Because if we landed from Mars,\n\n19:43.020 --> 19:46.260\n we couldn't tell a Jew from a Palestinian, could we?\n\n19:46.260 --> 19:47.740\n Just looking at them,\n\n19:47.740 --> 19:50.020\n you could easily mix them and you'd never know.\n\n19:50.020 --> 19:52.260\n And the specifics of the faith\n\n19:52.260 --> 19:54.700\n is not necessarily the thing that defines a person.\n\n19:54.700 --> 19:56.340\n No, I don't think so.\n\n19:56.340 --> 19:58.140\n So you could be, like many are,\n\n19:58.140 --> 20:01.980\n secular Jew living in Israel\n\n20:01.980 --> 20:04.100\n and still have a strong bond.\n\n20:04.100 --> 20:05.540\n Definitely, definitely.\n\n20:05.540 --> 20:08.460\n In fact, almost all of the Jews,\n\n20:08.460 --> 20:12.020\n the fighters that I spoke to from the Six Day War\n\n20:12.020 --> 20:15.020\n were secular and it really was not\n\n20:15.020 --> 20:19.460\n a religious thing with them\n\n20:19.460 --> 20:21.340\n as much as it was a national thing.\n\n20:22.540 --> 20:24.820\n So having spent time in Israel,\n\n20:27.220 --> 20:30.700\n how's the world where military conflict is directly felt\n\n20:30.700 --> 20:33.220\n as opposed to maybe if we look at the US\n\n20:33.220 --> 20:35.180\n where it's distant and far away?\n\n20:35.180 --> 20:36.380\n How is that world different?\n\n20:36.380 --> 20:37.460\n How are the people different?\n\n20:37.460 --> 20:40.300\n It's very different, as you know.\n\n20:40.300 --> 20:41.860\n I've never been to Israel, actually.\n\n20:41.860 --> 20:43.620\n Oh, you haven't? I haven't felt it.\n\n20:43.620 --> 20:46.940\n Ah, well, you should definitely go.\n\n20:46.940 --> 20:50.260\n I mean, here in the United States,\n\n20:51.460 --> 20:56.140\n where when an incident like Charlottesville comes up,\n\n20:56.140 --> 20:56.980\n where people are chanting,\n\n20:56.980 --> 20:59.260\n Jews will not replace us, blah, blah, blah,\n\n20:59.260 --> 21:02.740\n the impulse in the Jewish community is to think of,\n\n21:02.740 --> 21:05.820\n well, how can we reach out to the other side?\n\n21:05.820 --> 21:10.820\n How can we show them that we are human beings like they are\n\n21:10.820 --> 21:13.380\n and show them that we care for them, et cetera, et cetera?\n\n21:13.380 --> 21:16.660\n That's the sort of distant from war.\n\n21:16.660 --> 21:18.300\n From, if you're in Israel,\n\n21:20.020 --> 21:23.860\n like if you and I were Israeli citizens right now,\n\n21:23.860 --> 21:27.540\n you would be a fighter pilot or a tank commander or whatever.\n\n21:27.540 --> 21:30.980\n You would not just be working at MIT or whatever.\n\n21:30.980 --> 21:33.220\n And I would be in the army too.\n\n21:33.220 --> 21:35.220\n And so from their point of view,\n\n21:35.220 --> 21:38.180\n they say all those people who hate us,\n\n21:38.180 --> 21:39.500\n can I curse on this?\n\n21:39.500 --> 21:40.340\n Of course.\n\n21:40.340 --> 21:41.700\n Can I curse on this thing?\n\n21:41.700 --> 21:43.420\n Fuck them, we'll kill them.\n\n21:43.420 --> 21:44.260\n We'll kill them.\n\n21:44.260 --> 21:46.660\n If they dared to cross the line,\n\n21:46.660 --> 21:49.020\n and that's their whole different point of view.\n\n21:50.020 --> 21:52.260\n To me, it's actually a healthier point of view.\n\n21:52.260 --> 21:53.100\n You think so?\n\n21:53.100 --> 21:53.940\n Yeah.\n\n21:53.940 --> 21:57.220\n So there's no, so let me ask the hard question is,\n\n21:57.220 --> 21:59.700\n well, maybe it's an impossible question is,\n\n21:59.700 --> 22:02.980\n how do we resolve that conflict?\n\n22:02.980 --> 22:04.140\n In Israel and?\n\n22:04.140 --> 22:05.420\n In Israel or?\n\n22:05.420 --> 22:06.260\n Anywhere?\n\n22:06.260 --> 22:09.260\n Anywhere where the instinct is to reach out in US\n\n22:09.260 --> 22:13.900\n and say, F you and the people, yeah.\n\n22:13.900 --> 22:18.900\n Here's my, I think that the only way that two warring sides\n\n22:19.060 --> 22:21.460\n or two sides that are opposed to one another\n\n22:21.460 --> 22:22.980\n can ever really come together\n\n22:22.980 --> 22:24.660\n is when there's mutual respect,\n\n22:24.660 --> 22:26.540\n we'll get just more water.\n\n22:26.540 --> 22:27.380\n I got it, I got this.\n\n22:27.380 --> 22:28.780\n When there's mutual respect\n\n22:31.300 --> 22:33.260\n and they can see each other as equals\n\n22:33.260 --> 22:36.740\n and when there's mutual fear, you know,\n\n22:36.740 --> 22:40.300\n where one side says, we don't dare cross the line\n\n22:40.300 --> 22:41.500\n with this other side,\n\n22:41.500 --> 22:43.460\n and the other side says the same thing.\n\n22:43.460 --> 22:45.620\n I think then you can kind of reach across that thing\n\n22:45.620 --> 22:48.340\n and say, okay, we'll stay here, you stay here.\n\n22:48.340 --> 22:51.580\n We'll mingle in cultural ways\n\n22:51.580 --> 22:54.580\n and we'll have interchange, you know, winter marriage,\n\n22:54.580 --> 22:56.060\n da, da, da, da, da, da.\n\n22:56.060 --> 22:58.860\n But as soon as one side has no power,\n\n22:58.860 --> 23:01.300\n as the Jewish people have had no power\n\n23:01.300 --> 23:04.460\n throughout the diaspora forever, right?\n\n23:04.460 --> 23:07.620\n Then it's just a human nature.\n\n23:07.620 --> 23:09.300\n You can see it in Trump\n\n23:09.300 --> 23:13.100\n and what he does to any vulnerable minority, right?\n\n23:15.380 --> 23:16.500\n And he's not alone.\n\n23:16.500 --> 23:18.460\n I'm not blaming him alone.\n\n23:18.460 --> 23:19.860\n That's human nature.\n\n23:19.860 --> 23:22.700\n So I do think that that idea of like, fuck you,\n\n23:22.700 --> 23:24.740\n if you cross the line, we'll kill you,\n\n23:24.740 --> 23:28.140\n is really a good way, is a good place to start from.\n\n23:28.140 --> 23:30.940\n Because now you can sit down on opposite sides of the table\n\n23:30.940 --> 23:33.100\n and say, you know, what do we have in common?\n\n23:33.100 --> 23:35.100\n How can we, we want to raise our children.\n\n23:35.100 --> 23:36.620\n You want to raise your children.\n\n23:36.620 --> 23:41.100\n How can we do this in a way that we're not hurting each other?\n\n23:42.460 --> 23:45.180\n So you kind of said that you need to arrive at a balance,\n\n23:45.180 --> 23:46.740\n some kind of balance of power.\n\n23:46.740 --> 23:47.580\n Yeah.\n\n23:47.580 --> 23:49.220\n But you haven't spoken to the fact\n\n23:49.220 --> 23:54.220\n that there's deeply rooted hatred of the other.\n\n23:54.820 --> 23:57.300\n So is there no way to alleviate that hatred?\n\n23:57.300 --> 24:03.260\n Or is that, I mean, what role does love and hate come?\n\n24:03.260 --> 24:04.100\n I think that hatred can go away.\n\n24:04.100 --> 24:04.940\n I really do.\n\n24:04.940 --> 24:07.140\n I mean, if you look at even now\n\n24:07.140 --> 24:09.700\n that I haven't seen this in person,\n\n24:09.700 --> 24:12.700\n but they say that the Saudis and the Israelis\n\n24:12.700 --> 24:15.220\n are collaborating in certain things, you know,\n\n24:15.220 --> 24:18.500\n by their mutual fear of or antagonism to Iran.\n\n24:19.420 --> 24:24.420\n I do think that even really long, long, longstanding\n\n24:24.420 --> 24:27.700\n hatreds and animosities, thousands of years old,\n\n24:27.700 --> 24:30.660\n can go away under the right circumstances.\n\n24:30.660 --> 24:33.020\n In a, on what time scale?\n\n24:34.540 --> 24:37.340\n I mean, for instance, I don't know if there's some,\n\n24:37.340 --> 24:39.220\n do people have to die?\n\n24:39.220 --> 24:41.380\n Do generations have to die and pass away\n\n24:41.380 --> 24:44.340\n and new generations come up with less hate?\n\n24:44.340 --> 24:47.180\n Or can a single individual learn to not hate?\n\n24:47.180 --> 24:49.420\n I think a single individual can learn to not hate\n\n24:49.420 --> 24:50.860\n because it certainly doesn't seem to,\n\n24:50.860 --> 24:52.940\n over thousands of years, doesn't seem to work.\n\n24:52.940 --> 24:55.340\n You know, we keep thinking that that's gonna happen.\n\n24:55.340 --> 25:00.340\n But I think it's, we're in a real spiritual realm here\n\n25:00.740 --> 25:02.140\n when you're talking about that.\n\n25:02.140 --> 25:05.660\n You're in a realm of, you know, Buddha, Jesus, whatever,\n\n25:05.660 --> 25:09.500\n something like that, that where, you know,\n\n25:10.460 --> 25:13.380\n a true change of soul happens.\n\n25:13.380 --> 25:15.020\n But I do think that's possible.\n\n25:16.340 --> 25:20.700\n So what do you think is the future of warfare?\n\n25:20.700 --> 25:25.140\n Especially with what many people see as the expansion\n\n25:25.140 --> 25:27.340\n of the military industrial conflict.\n\n25:27.340 --> 25:31.600\n To what, do you, I know you're not a military historian.\n\n25:32.500 --> 25:35.260\n I'm asking more as a metaphor.\n\n25:36.420 --> 25:40.380\n And do you see us as people continuing to fight?\n\n25:41.380 --> 25:43.740\n You know, it's a really great question, Alex,\n\n25:43.740 --> 25:48.740\n because I think now with social media, TV, movies,\n\n25:48.740 --> 25:53.740\n all of these things that create empathy across cultures,\n\n25:55.220 --> 25:58.820\n it becomes harder and harder, I think, I think,\n\n25:58.820 --> 26:02.080\n to totally demonize the other,\n\n26:02.080 --> 26:05.100\n the way it was in previous wars.\n\n26:05.100 --> 26:08.780\n I also think, I don't really see an appetite\n\n26:08.780 --> 26:12.060\n for people wanting to go to war these days.\n\n26:12.060 --> 26:15.140\n And in a way, I don't know if that's good or bad.\n\n26:15.140 --> 26:17.580\n It's like everybody's so fat and lazy\n\n26:17.580 --> 26:20.500\n and so concerned with how many clicks they're getting\n\n26:20.500 --> 26:25.500\n that, you know, whereas I know at the start of World War I,\n\n26:26.420 --> 26:30.900\n both the younger generations were eager to go to war.\n\n26:30.900 --> 26:34.500\n You know, I think it was insane,\n\n26:34.500 --> 26:36.540\n but it was that sort of warrior archetype\n\n26:36.540 --> 26:38.540\n that we were talking about before that,\n\n26:38.540 --> 26:43.540\n that generational testosterone eros thing.\n\n26:43.540 --> 26:48.060\n Whereas nowadays, I don't know.\n\n26:48.060 --> 26:52.180\n I mean, it's hard to say there's not gonna be another war\n\n26:52.180 --> 26:53.940\n because there always are,\n\n26:53.940 --> 26:55.780\n but it's sort of hard to imagine people\n\n26:55.780 --> 26:59.380\n getting off their ass these days to do anything.\n\n26:59.380 --> 27:01.460\n Well, it's funny that you mentioned social media\n\n27:01.460 --> 27:03.700\n as a place for empathy, sure.\n\n27:03.700 --> 27:08.140\n But in a sense, it's a place for war as well.\n\n27:08.140 --> 27:08.980\n For hatred, yeah, true.\n\n27:08.980 --> 27:09.820\n For hatred.\n\n27:09.820 --> 27:14.820\n And perhaps the positive aspect of hatred on social media\n\n27:16.700 --> 27:21.340\n is that it's somewhat less harmful than murder.\n\n27:22.220 --> 27:26.140\n And so it kind of dissipates sort of the hatefuls.\n\n27:27.580 --> 27:30.580\n You get the hate out at a less,\n\n27:35.100 --> 27:37.900\n on a daily basis and thereby never boils up\n\n27:37.900 --> 27:39.460\n to a point where you want to kill.\n\n27:39.460 --> 27:42.300\n It's also a really weird thing that's going on\n\n27:42.300 --> 27:43.820\n that I don't know if anybody really understands,\n\n27:43.820 --> 27:47.700\n like with video games where kids are acting out\n\n27:47.700 --> 27:49.980\n these incredible horror things, right?\n\n27:49.980 --> 27:52.660\n But you know that if they cut their finger,\n\n27:52.660 --> 27:55.860\n they would like freak out, you know?\n\n27:55.860 --> 27:58.860\n And I also don't think that many of the people\n\n27:58.860 --> 28:02.380\n that are hateful on social media,\n\n28:02.380 --> 28:05.260\n if they were face to face with the person, they wouldn't.\n\n28:05.260 --> 28:10.260\n So there's a sort of two mental spheres\n\n28:11.060 --> 28:13.180\n happening at the same time.\n\n28:13.180 --> 28:15.620\n And I don't know how that plays out.\n\n28:15.620 --> 28:17.260\n Maps to the actual military,\n\n28:17.260 --> 28:19.220\n how that actually maps to military conflict.\n\n28:19.220 --> 28:20.060\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n28:21.020 --> 28:25.380\n Like if you in the United States have a draft, for example,\n\n28:25.380 --> 28:28.300\n how the populace would respond different than they did\n\n28:28.300 --> 28:29.460\n in previous generations.\n\n28:29.460 --> 28:30.820\n Yeah, I think they certainly would.\n\n28:30.820 --> 28:31.780\n Yeah.\n\n28:31.780 --> 28:34.260\n Another question, not sure if you've thought about it,\n\n28:34.260 --> 28:38.140\n but I work on building artificial intelligence systems.\n\n28:38.140 --> 28:39.780\n In our community, many people are worried\n\n28:39.780 --> 28:41.740\n about AI being used in war.\n\n28:41.740 --> 28:46.740\n So automating the killing process with drones\n\n28:46.940 --> 28:49.080\n and in general, it's being used more and more.\n\n28:49.080 --> 28:50.680\n I should recuse myself on that one.\n\n28:50.680 --> 28:51.740\n I really haven't thought about that one.\n\n28:51.740 --> 28:52.580\n You haven't thought about it.\n\n28:52.580 --> 28:55.300\n I'd rather ask you what you think about it.\n\n28:55.300 --> 28:56.260\n Well, it's interesting, I mean,\n\n28:56.260 --> 28:57.920\n because it's so fundamentally different\n\n28:57.920 --> 29:02.020\n from if you look at the Battle of Thermopylae.\n\n29:02.020 --> 29:05.020\n It means just if we talk about the difference between a gun\n\n29:05.020 --> 29:07.460\n and a sword.\n\n29:07.460 --> 29:09.360\n I'll tell you one little anecdote.\n\n29:09.360 --> 29:13.540\n There was a Spartan king, I don't know which one it was,\n\n29:13.540 --> 29:16.540\n but at one point they showed him a new invention\n\n29:16.540 --> 29:20.620\n and it could launch a bolt that would kill someone\n\n29:20.620 --> 29:22.380\n at a range of 200 yards.\n\n29:22.380 --> 29:27.380\n And the king wept and said, alas, valor is no more.\n\n29:27.380 --> 29:30.460\n Because their point of view of war,\n\n29:30.460 --> 29:32.740\n it was highly ritualized, as you know,\n\n29:32.740 --> 29:37.420\n and the code of honor was that you were not supposed\n\n29:37.420 --> 29:39.420\n to be able to kill another person\n\n29:39.420 --> 29:43.180\n unless you yourself were in equal danger of being killed.\n\n29:43.180 --> 29:44.740\n And any other way of doing that,\n\n29:44.740 --> 29:49.740\n even bow and arrow was considered less than manly\n\n29:50.540 --> 29:51.700\n and less than honorable.\n\n29:51.700 --> 29:53.220\n And maybe we should go back to that\n\n29:53.220 --> 29:56.540\n because at least it makes the stakes real and true.\n\n29:56.540 --> 30:01.540\n Not that we could.\n\n30:02.220 --> 30:04.980\n Not that's the point.\n\n30:04.980 --> 30:06.660\n You were in the Marine Corps,\n\n30:06.660 --> 30:11.660\n so we talk about the real, the bloody conflicts\n\n30:13.780 --> 30:16.620\n that you've written about, many of them.\n\n30:16.620 --> 30:20.280\n So let me ask a personal question.\n\n30:21.180 --> 30:24.340\n Have you, sort of as a writing and in general,\n\n30:24.340 --> 30:28.940\n have you thought about what it takes to kill a person\n\n30:30.260 --> 30:33.180\n if you yourself could do it in the war?\n\n30:33.180 --> 30:34.220\n I have thought about it, yeah.\n\n30:34.220 --> 30:36.920\n And how that would make you feel?\n\n30:37.940 --> 30:39.660\n Of course, one never knows.\n\n30:39.660 --> 30:41.340\n I certainly, I have not been in combat.\n\n30:41.340 --> 30:43.140\n I haven't killed anybody.\n\n30:43.140 --> 30:47.700\n But I would imagine in the real world\n\n30:47.700 --> 30:51.720\n that it would change you utterly forever.\n\n30:51.720 --> 30:56.720\n Because you can't help but identify\n\n30:58.880 --> 31:01.280\n with the person that you've just killed.\n\n31:01.280 --> 31:02.920\n And it's another human being.\n\n31:02.920 --> 31:07.100\n And I mean, I have a hard time killing a spider.\n\n31:07.100 --> 31:09.880\n So I would imagine that it's something\n\n31:09.880 --> 31:14.260\n that warriors understand and nobody else understands.\n\n31:15.100 --> 31:16.760\n And you've spoken with many.\n\n31:16.760 --> 31:19.320\n How, I mean, you've spoken with people\n\n31:19.320 --> 31:21.940\n who've seen military combat in Israel.\n\n31:23.160 --> 31:26.640\n What, have they been able to articulate\n\n31:26.640 --> 31:28.980\n the experience of killing?\n\n31:28.980 --> 31:31.100\n It's sort of just what I said.\n\n31:31.100 --> 31:34.600\n I mean, I'm even thinking of one pilot\n\n31:34.600 --> 31:36.580\n that I interviewed over there\n\n31:37.880 --> 31:42.880\n who was strafing a tank in his Mustang\n\n31:45.180 --> 31:48.120\n and saw, at really low altitude,\n\n31:48.120 --> 31:50.880\n and saw what his bullets did to the guy\n\n31:50.880 --> 31:52.920\n and could see his face and everything like that,\n\n31:52.920 --> 31:56.360\n which is even one remove or more removes\n\n31:56.360 --> 31:59.200\n from an infantryman, what an infantryman does.\n\n31:59.200 --> 32:02.000\n And he said that same thing that I said,\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.600\n that it just changes you and you can never say it,\n\n32:04.600 --> 32:07.000\n never look at the world or look at anything\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.640\n the same way again.\n\n32:08.640 --> 32:10.700\n And when that happens at scale,\n\n32:10.700 --> 32:13.120\n it's thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds.\n\n32:13.120 --> 32:14.600\n That changes entire societies.\n\n32:14.600 --> 32:16.560\n I mean, that's what we've seen.\n\n32:16.560 --> 32:18.200\n At least it, but the problem is\n\n32:18.200 --> 32:20.440\n it doesn't change the politicians back home.\n\n32:20.440 --> 32:21.280\n Right.\n\n32:22.280 --> 32:26.280\n How important is mortality, finiteness,\n\n32:28.480 --> 32:32.280\n the fact that this thing ends to the creative process?\n\n32:32.280 --> 32:37.280\n So, killing and war really emphasizes that,\n\n32:37.800 --> 32:41.380\n but in general, the fact that this thing ends.\n\n32:42.760 --> 32:43.920\n It does?\n\n32:43.920 --> 32:46.280\n It does, and uh.\n\n32:46.280 --> 32:47.120\n Shit.\n\n32:49.400 --> 32:51.560\n And on a serious note,\n\n32:51.560 --> 32:53.640\n do you think about your own mortality?\n\n32:53.640 --> 32:55.520\n Do you meditate on your own mortality\n\n32:55.520 --> 32:57.240\n when you think about the work you do?\n\n32:57.240 --> 32:59.320\n That's another great question, Lex.\n\n32:59.320 --> 33:03.480\n I actually, I'm 75, and I just was having,\n\n33:03.480 --> 33:05.620\n I had breakfast in New York a few months ago\n\n33:05.620 --> 33:08.880\n with a friend of mine who's like my exact same age.\n\n33:08.880 --> 33:10.720\n And I said to him, I said,\n\n33:10.720 --> 33:12.940\n Nick, do you ever think about mortality?\n\n33:12.940 --> 33:16.680\n And he said, every fucking minute of every day.\n\n33:16.680 --> 33:21.020\n And I was kind of relieved to hear that because I do too.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.640\n But actually, I always have, I think.\n\n33:24.640 --> 33:28.360\n And I think, you know, the fact of mortality\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:32.460\n gives meaning to life, you know?\n\n33:32.460 --> 33:34.520\n I think that's why we want to create.\n\n33:36.160 --> 33:39.540\n That's why we want to make a mark of some kind.\n\n33:39.540 --> 33:43.980\n Or, and the other aspect of it is\n\n33:43.980 --> 33:46.860\n what's on the other side of that mortality?\n\n33:46.860 --> 33:49.500\n I'm a believer in previous lives.\n\n33:49.500 --> 33:52.780\n So I sort of, and I,\n\n33:52.780 --> 33:54.980\n the question I've never been able to answer\n\n33:54.980 --> 33:58.740\n among many, many others is like, why are we even here?\n\n33:58.740 --> 34:01.620\n Why are we in the flesh?\n\n34:01.620 --> 34:04.060\n You know, I sort of, I like to believe that God\n\n34:04.060 --> 34:13.060\n or some force is, we're on some kind of journey, but I'm not sure why,\n\n34:13.060 --> 34:17.340\n why we were put in this world where the ground rules are,\n\n34:17.340 --> 34:19.980\n if you think about animal life,\n\n34:19.980 --> 34:22.660\n that you cannot live from one day to the next\n\n34:22.660 --> 34:26.780\n without killing and eating some other form of life.\n\n34:26.780 --> 34:29.820\n I mean, what a demented thing, you know?\n\n34:29.820 --> 34:33.100\n Why couldn't we just have a solar panel on our head\n\n34:33.100 --> 34:35.500\n and, you know, be friends with everybody?\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:40.160\n So I sort of, I don't get what that was all about,\n\n34:40.160 --> 34:42.380\n but that's sort of the big issue.\n\n34:42.380 --> 34:46.160\n Have you read to Ernest Becker's Denial of Death, for example?\n\n34:46.160 --> 34:51.160\n Is Ernest Becker's a philosopher that said that the death,\n\n34:52.100 --> 34:57.100\n that the fear of death is really the primary driver\n\n34:57.380 --> 34:58.420\n of everything we do.\n\n34:58.420 --> 35:00.460\n So Freud had what the?\n\n35:00.460 --> 35:02.420\n Right, I would agree with that.\n\n35:02.420 --> 35:04.660\n So to you, you've always thought about your,\n\n35:04.660 --> 35:06.080\n even your own mortality.\n\n35:06.080 --> 35:07.820\n Yes, definitely.\n\n35:07.820 --> 35:13.780\n And can you elaborate on the reincarnation aspect\n\n35:13.780 --> 35:14.780\n of what you were talking about?\n\n35:14.780 --> 35:17.540\n Like that we kind of, what's your sense\n\n35:17.540 --> 35:19.580\n that we had previous lives?\n\n35:20.860 --> 35:22.720\n In what, have you thought concretely\n\n35:22.720 --> 35:24.900\n or is it a lot of it kind of is?\n\n35:24.900 --> 35:27.540\n No, I've thought concretely about it.\n\n35:27.540 --> 35:32.540\n I mean, it's very clear when you see children,\n\n35:32.860 --> 35:36.780\n young kids, or even dogs and cats,\n\n35:36.780 --> 35:40.620\n that they come into the world with personalities, you know,\n\n35:40.620 --> 35:43.700\n and three kids in a family are gonna be completely different\n\n35:43.700 --> 35:45.420\n and completely their own person.\n\n35:45.420 --> 35:50.420\n And that person that they are doesn't change over life.\n\n35:50.420 --> 35:57.420\n And I, you know, there's one of the things that I did in my book\n\n35:58.100 --> 36:00.420\n The Artist's Journey is that there were certain things\n\n36:00.420 --> 36:02.900\n where I tracked or just listed in order,\n\n36:02.900 --> 36:05.400\n like all of Bruce Springsteen's albums\n\n36:05.400 --> 36:07.900\n or all of Philip Roth's books, you know,\n\n36:07.900 --> 36:10.180\n kind of a body of work throughout over, you know,\n\n36:10.180 --> 36:13.020\n a period of 30, 40, 50 years, you know.\n\n36:13.020 --> 36:18.020\n And you can see that there's a theme running through all\n\n36:18.020 --> 36:22.740\n of those things, that it's completely unique to that person.\n\n36:22.740 --> 36:25.140\n Nobody else could have written Philip Roth's books\n\n36:25.140 --> 36:28.060\n or Bruce Springsteen's songs.\n\n36:28.060 --> 36:31.620\n And you can even see sort of a destiny there.\n\n36:31.620 --> 36:36.020\n So I ask myself, well, where did that come from?\n\n36:36.020 --> 36:41.020\n What, it seems to be a continuation of something that was,\n\n36:41.220 --> 36:44.420\n that happened before, and that will lead to something else\n\n36:44.420 --> 36:47.020\n because it's not starting from scratch.\n\n36:47.020 --> 36:52.020\n It seems like there's a calling, a destiny in there already.\n\n36:53.340 --> 36:56.020\n This gets back to the muse and all that kind of thing.\n\n36:56.020 --> 36:59.540\n So yeah, it's almost like the, there's this,\n\n36:59.540 --> 37:03.380\n let's call it a God, it's passing,\n\n37:03.380 --> 37:07.300\n it's almost like sampling parts of a previous human\n\n37:07.300 --> 37:10.840\n that has lived and putting those into the new one.\n\n37:11.740 --> 37:14.060\n Sampling is probably a pretty good word.\n\n37:14.060 --> 37:15.700\n Taking some of the good, well, you can't take\n\n37:15.700 --> 37:17.500\n all the good parts because the bad parts\n\n37:17.500 --> 37:19.660\n is what makes the person.\n\n37:19.660 --> 37:21.160\n Let's say you're taking it all together.\n\n37:21.160 --> 37:24.060\n Okay, this is humans only, or does it pass around\n\n37:24.060 --> 37:25.360\n from animals in your view?\n\n37:26.340 --> 37:29.580\n I don't know, that's above my pay grade, I don't know.\n\n37:29.580 --> 37:33.180\n So, okay, so you talk about the muse\n\n37:33.180 --> 37:38.180\n as the source of ideas maybe.\n\n37:39.240 --> 37:44.240\n Since you've gotten a few glimpses of her in your writing,\n\n37:44.240 --> 37:49.240\n tell me, what is it possible for you to tell me about her?\n\n37:51.680 --> 37:53.680\n Where does she reside?\n\n37:53.680 --> 37:54.920\n What does she look like?\n\n37:54.920 --> 37:57.680\n I mean, you can look at it many different ways, right?\n\n37:57.680 --> 38:00.480\n The Greeks did it in an anthropomorphic way, right?\n\n38:00.480 --> 38:02.840\n They created gods that were like human beings.\n\n38:03.720 --> 38:07.440\n But if you look at it from a Kabbalistic Jewish perspective,\n\n38:07.440 --> 38:09.440\n Jewish mysticism, you could say\n\n38:09.440 --> 38:11.800\n that it's the soul, the neshama, right?\n\n38:11.800 --> 38:14.320\n That the soul is above us on a higher plane,\n\n38:14.320 --> 38:16.480\n our own, your soul, my soul,\n\n38:16.480 --> 38:21.360\n and is trying to reach down to us and communicate with us.\n\n38:21.360 --> 38:24.680\n And we're trying simultaneously to reach up to it\n\n38:24.680 --> 38:28.520\n through prayer or through, if you're a writer or an artist,\n\n38:28.520 --> 38:31.000\n you know, when you sit down at the keyboard,\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.580\n you're entering into a kind of prayer.\n\n38:33.580 --> 38:35.520\n You're entering into a different state\n\n38:35.520 --> 38:39.480\n of an altered consciousness to some extent.\n\n38:39.480 --> 38:41.840\n You're opening yourself, opening the pipeline,\n\n38:41.840 --> 38:44.080\n or turning on the radio to tune into\n\n38:44.080 --> 38:46.640\n the cosmic radio station.\n\n38:46.640 --> 38:49.280\n And another way of looking at it, this is an,\n\n38:49.280 --> 38:53.800\n did you ever see the movie City of Angels?\n\n38:53.800 --> 38:58.800\n The visual of the movie, it was Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage.\n\n38:59.280 --> 39:01.200\n Yeah, yeah, I've seen it, yep.\n\n39:01.200 --> 39:04.200\n And right, the visual of the movie sort of was\n\n39:05.240 --> 39:08.960\n Meg Ryan is a heart surgeon.\n\n39:08.960 --> 39:11.320\n And as she's operating on somebody,\n\n39:11.320 --> 39:14.780\n suddenly Nicolas Cage in this long duster coat,\n\n39:14.780 --> 39:17.680\n like Jesse James, appears right next to her\n\n39:17.680 --> 39:19.920\n in the operating room, and he's an angel.\n\n39:19.920 --> 39:23.520\n And he's waiting to take out the soul\n\n39:23.520 --> 39:27.000\n of the patient on the operating table.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.720\n And she doesn't see him, she's totally unaware of him.\n\n39:29.720 --> 39:31.820\n And so is everybody else in the operating room,\n\n39:31.820 --> 39:33.920\n except maybe the guy who's about to die,\n\n39:33.920 --> 39:35.480\n who suddenly sees him.\n\n39:35.480 --> 39:40.480\n But I kind of believe that there are beings like that,\n\n39:42.160 --> 39:44.640\n or if you don't like that, it's a force,\n\n39:44.640 --> 39:46.840\n it's a consciousness, it's something\n\n39:46.840 --> 39:48.480\n that are right here, right now.\n\n39:49.800 --> 39:53.560\n And they're trying to communicate to us.\n\n39:54.560 --> 39:57.200\n And like through a membrane,\n\n39:57.200 --> 39:59.160\n like tapping on that window over there,\n\n39:59.160 --> 40:00.720\n they're like right out there.\n\n40:00.720 --> 40:03.600\n And they carry the future.\n\n40:03.600 --> 40:08.160\n They are everything that is in potential.\n\n40:08.160 --> 40:11.340\n All the works that you will do, Lex,\n\n40:11.340 --> 40:14.480\n your startup, whatever else you're doing,\n\n40:14.480 --> 40:17.780\n they know that.\n\n40:17.780 --> 40:19.800\n And it's not really you\n\n40:19.800 --> 40:22.680\n that's coming up with those ideas, in my opinion.\n\n40:22.680 --> 40:24.740\n Those things are appearing,\n\n40:24.740 --> 40:28.080\n it's like somebody knocks on the door and puts it in.\n\n40:28.080 --> 40:33.080\n I mean, in the Iliad, where gods and goddesses appear,\n\n40:33.880 --> 40:35.840\n along with the human antagonists\n\n40:35.840 --> 40:37.960\n on the battlefield all the time, right?\n\n40:37.960 --> 40:40.880\n There'll be, you know, Homer flashes to Olympus\n\n40:40.880 --> 40:42.520\n and then back to the real world.\n\n40:42.520 --> 40:45.280\n And there's a thing where one Aphrodite,\n\n40:45.280 --> 40:47.880\n let's say wants to help Paris.\n\n40:47.880 --> 40:52.520\n And so she says, well, I will appear to him in a dream.\n\n40:52.520 --> 40:55.800\n And I'll take the form of his brother\n\n40:55.800 --> 40:57.680\n and I'll say, bump, bump, bump, bump.\n\n40:57.680 --> 41:02.680\n So that's creatures, beings on one dimension,\n\n41:03.520 --> 41:06.600\n as the Greeks saw it, communicating with,\n\n41:06.600 --> 41:09.380\n and I believe that that's exactly what's going on,\n\n41:09.380 --> 41:12.560\n in one, whatever analogy you want to use.\n\n41:12.560 --> 41:15.800\n That communication, to which degree\n\n41:17.600 --> 41:20.500\n do you play the role in that communication?\n\n41:20.500 --> 41:23.080\n As opposed to sitting at the computer,\n\n41:23.080 --> 41:27.120\n if you're a writer, and staring at the blank page\n\n41:27.120 --> 41:29.440\n and putting in the time and waiting.\n\n41:30.640 --> 41:35.640\n So if, in your view, are these creatures\n\n41:39.240 --> 41:42.040\n basically waiting to tell you about your future?\n\n41:42.960 --> 41:44.960\n Or is there choice?\n\n41:44.960 --> 41:46.720\n How many possible futures are there?\n\n41:46.720 --> 41:48.480\n How many possible ideas are there?\n\n41:48.480 --> 41:49.680\n That's a great question.\n\n41:49.680 --> 41:54.440\n I think there's basically, yes, there are alternatives,\n\n41:54.440 --> 41:56.800\n you know, degrees within it.\n\n41:56.800 --> 41:59.700\n But if you look at Bruce Springsteen's albums,\n\n42:01.280 --> 42:05.840\n how much could he have done really differently?\n\n42:05.840 --> 42:08.120\n Yeah, he would, you can just see\n\n42:08.120 --> 42:11.360\n there's a whole impetus going through the whole thing.\n\n42:11.360 --> 42:14.080\n And nothing was going to shake him off that, you know?\n\n42:14.080 --> 42:16.880\n And yeah, maybe the river could have been different,\n\n42:16.880 --> 42:18.960\n could have been called something else,\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:23.080\n but he was dealing with certain issues.\n\n42:23.080 --> 42:26.220\n His conscious self was dealing with certain issues\n\n42:26.220 --> 42:28.040\n that were really out of his control.\n\n42:28.040 --> 42:30.900\n He was drawn, he was called to it, right?\n\n42:30.900 --> 42:32.760\n Nothing could stop him.\n\n42:32.760 --> 42:37.320\n And so it is sort of a partnership, I think,\n\n42:37.320 --> 42:41.640\n the creative process, between the creative impulse\n\n42:41.640 --> 42:43.600\n that's coming from some other place,\n\n42:45.360 --> 42:47.120\n or it's coming from deep within us\n\n42:47.120 --> 42:48.480\n is another way to look at it.\n\n42:48.480 --> 42:50.520\n You know, it's like if we are acorns\n\n42:50.520 --> 42:53.300\n and we're growing into oaks.\n\n42:53.300 --> 42:58.200\n So the conscious artist,\n\n42:58.200 --> 43:01.040\n who's sitting there at the keyboard or whatever,\n\n43:01.040 --> 43:04.800\n is applying his or her consciousness to that,\n\n43:04.800 --> 43:08.960\n but is also going into opening themselves\n\n43:08.960 --> 43:11.120\n to the unconscious or to this other realm,\n\n43:11.120 --> 43:13.140\n whatever that is.\n\n43:13.140 --> 43:16.200\n I mean, certainly songwriters for a million years\n\n43:16.200 --> 43:18.280\n have said, you know, a song just came into their head,\n\n43:18.280 --> 43:19.120\n right?\n\n43:19.120 --> 43:21.020\n A poem, just all they had to do was write.\n\n43:21.020 --> 43:23.920\n But then, you ever see that thing where,\n\n43:23.920 --> 43:28.360\n of Keats's notes for a thing of beauty is a joy forever?\n\n43:28.360 --> 43:29.760\n It's like covers an entire page,\n\n43:29.760 --> 43:32.000\n and it's like, you know, he's crossing this out\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:33.080\n and that out, and he has to go.\n\n43:33.080 --> 43:36.660\n His consciousness is, his conscious mind is working on it.\n\n43:36.660 --> 43:39.600\n But, so I do think it's a partnership.\n\n43:39.600 --> 43:42.800\n And I think that, I know when I was first starting out\n\n43:42.800 --> 43:45.680\n as a writer, I worked in advertising,\n\n43:45.680 --> 43:49.040\n and I tried to do novels that I could never do.\n\n43:49.040 --> 43:54.040\n I was like, really unskilled at getting to that,\n\n43:54.880 --> 43:56.760\n tuning into that station.\n\n43:56.760 --> 44:01.760\n I just, I beat my brains out and was unable to do it,\n\n44:01.900 --> 44:03.240\n you know, except in,\n\n44:03.240 --> 44:05.320\n because I was sort of trying too hard,\n\n44:05.320 --> 44:08.980\n it was sort of like a Zen monk or a monk of some kind\n\n44:08.980 --> 44:12.520\n trying to meditate and just like constantly thoughts\n\n44:12.520 --> 44:14.240\n driving you crazy.\n\n44:14.240 --> 44:16.420\n But over time, you know, knock wood,\n\n44:16.420 --> 44:19.280\n I've kind of gotten better at it.\n\n44:19.280 --> 44:22.200\n And I can sort of let go of those,\n\n44:22.200 --> 44:25.520\n that part of me that's trying so hard.\n\n44:25.520 --> 44:30.520\n And so these angels can speak a little more easily\n\n44:31.140 --> 44:32.400\n through the membrane.\n\n44:32.400 --> 44:36.760\n Can you put into words the process of letting go\n\n44:36.760 --> 44:40.080\n and clearing that channel of communication?\n\n44:40.080 --> 44:41.080\n What does it take?\n\n44:41.080 --> 44:42.200\n That's another great question.\n\n44:42.200 --> 44:46.440\n For me, it just took, it took probably 30 years.\n\n44:46.440 --> 44:49.680\n And I don't even, I guess I would liken it to meditation,\n\n44:49.680 --> 44:51.280\n even though I'm not a meditator.\n\n44:52.400 --> 44:54.720\n But it would seem to me to be one of the hardest things\n\n44:54.720 --> 44:59.720\n in the world to just sit still and stop thinking, right?\n\n45:00.560 --> 45:03.240\n And so it's very hard to put into words.\n\n45:03.240 --> 45:06.400\n And I think that's why these teachers of meditation\n\n45:06.400 --> 45:10.880\n use tricks and koans and stuff like that.\n\n45:10.880 --> 45:15.500\n But for me, at least, I think it was just a process\n\n45:15.500 --> 45:17.920\n of years of years and years of trying,\n\n45:17.920 --> 45:20.560\n and finally beating my head in the wall.\n\n45:20.560 --> 45:22.840\n And finally, little by little giving up\n\n45:22.840 --> 45:25.080\n the beating of the head.\n\n45:26.480 --> 45:28.000\n But there doesn't seem to be any trick.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:30.580\n Everybody wants a hack these days.\n\n45:30.580 --> 45:32.280\n And I don't think there is a hack.\n\n45:34.200 --> 45:37.360\n If you look at it in terms of the goddess, the muse,\n\n45:37.360 --> 45:39.360\n she's watching you down there,\n\n45:39.360 --> 45:40.800\n beating your head in the wall.\n\n45:40.800 --> 45:43.560\n You're like a Marine going through an obstacle course,\n\n45:43.560 --> 45:46.080\n or a martial artist trying to learn,\n\n45:46.080 --> 45:49.000\n like Uma Thurman doing the casket deal,\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.800\n trying to make that little four inch punch, you know?\n\n45:54.040 --> 45:56.400\n The muse or the goddess is just sort of watching,\n\n45:56.400 --> 45:59.620\n going, it's Lex, he's trying, he's trying.\n\n45:59.620 --> 46:01.380\n I'm gonna come back in another couple of months\n\n46:01.380 --> 46:03.080\n and see if he's still there.\n\n46:03.080 --> 46:06.160\n And finally, she'll say, all right, he's had it,\n\n46:06.160 --> 46:09.760\n he's paid his dues, I'm gonna give it to him.\n\n46:09.760 --> 46:13.560\n So, the hard work and the suffering, yeah.\n\n46:13.560 --> 46:18.560\n But I'm also, being Russian, in wrestling and martial arts,\n\n46:18.740 --> 46:21.080\n we're big into drilling technique.\n\n46:21.080 --> 46:23.200\n I was also just even getting at,\n\n46:24.560 --> 46:26.360\n certainly there's no shortcut.\n\n46:26.360 --> 46:28.100\n But is there a process?\n\n46:28.100 --> 46:33.100\n So you're, that can be, the process of practice.\n\n46:33.100 --> 46:35.660\n So you had two.\n\n46:35.660 --> 46:39.020\n One, you had an example of meditation.\n\n46:39.020 --> 46:41.860\n So it's essentially the practice of meditation.\n\n46:41.860 --> 46:42.700\n Is you sitting here?\n\n46:42.700 --> 46:44.100\n I think a lot of drill, I think,\n\n46:44.100 --> 46:45.980\n is a good way to look at it too.\n\n46:45.980 --> 46:48.220\n But what are you drilling?\n\n46:48.220 --> 46:50.220\n You're just sitting and?\n\n46:50.220 --> 46:51.780\n You're writing, you know?\n\n46:51.780 --> 46:52.620\n Just writing.\n\n46:52.620 --> 46:55.540\n You're writing, then you're looking at what you wrote,\n\n46:55.540 --> 46:56.380\n you know?\n\n46:56.380 --> 47:00.660\n You're hitting moments when it flows, you know?\n\n47:00.660 --> 47:02.600\n And then your other hitting moments\n\n47:02.600 --> 47:03.740\n where you just can't do anything.\n\n47:03.740 --> 47:07.060\n And you're trying to, from the moments where it flowed,\n\n47:07.060 --> 47:08.500\n you're trying to come back and look at it and say,\n\n47:08.500 --> 47:09.820\n what did I do?\n\n47:09.820 --> 47:11.600\n How did that happen?\n\n47:11.600 --> 47:13.780\n Where was my mind, you know?\n\n47:13.780 --> 47:16.300\n But I think it's just a process of over and over\n\n47:16.300 --> 47:21.160\n and over and over until finally it gets a little bit easier.\n\n47:22.220 --> 47:26.420\n And did you always, when you read something you write,\n\n47:26.420 --> 47:28.620\n did you always have a pretty good radar\n\n47:28.620 --> 47:33.100\n for what's good and not after it's written?\n\n47:33.100 --> 47:33.940\n No.\n\n47:33.940 --> 47:37.460\n I think I do now.\n\n47:37.460 --> 47:42.460\n But no, it was always really hard\n\n47:42.860 --> 47:44.340\n for me to know what was good.\n\n47:45.680 --> 47:48.220\n I mean, do you edit, the process of editing\n\n47:49.300 --> 47:52.100\n is the process of looking at what you've written\n\n47:52.100 --> 47:54.060\n and improving it.\n\n47:54.060 --> 47:56.460\n Are you a better writer or an editor?\n\n47:56.460 --> 47:57.820\n How often do you edit?\n\n47:57.820 --> 47:59.300\n That's another great question.\n\n47:59.300 --> 48:00.140\n Great question.\n\n48:00.140 --> 48:01.980\n Cause I do think that in writing,\n\n48:01.980 --> 48:03.740\n the real process of looking at it\n\n48:03.740 --> 48:05.820\n is the process that an editor does\n\n48:05.820 --> 48:08.100\n rather than what a writer does.\n\n48:08.100 --> 48:10.420\n The gentleman I was just talking to on the phone\n\n48:10.420 --> 48:12.020\n is my editor, Sean Coyne,\n\n48:12.020 --> 48:14.600\n who was the guy who bought Gates of Fire\n\n48:14.600 --> 48:16.780\n when he was an editor at Doubleday.\n\n48:16.780 --> 48:20.360\n And who basically when I finish a book, I give it to him.\n\n48:21.220 --> 48:23.860\n And he gives me, you know,\n\n48:23.860 --> 48:28.860\n editing doesn't really mean like crossing out commas.\n\n48:29.580 --> 48:34.220\n It really means looking at the overall work\n\n48:34.220 --> 48:36.380\n and saying, does it work?\n\n48:36.380 --> 48:39.100\n And if it doesn't work, why doesn't it work?\n\n48:39.100 --> 48:41.020\n Is there something wrong here?\n\n48:41.020 --> 48:44.540\n You know, like if you were building the Golden Gate Bridge,\n\n48:44.540 --> 48:46.620\n you know, and one span was out of whack, you know,\n\n48:46.620 --> 48:50.260\n you could, and I think a really skilled editor,\n\n48:50.260 --> 48:54.860\n which Sean is, understands what makes a story tick.\n\n48:54.860 --> 48:58.220\n And he also has the perspective that I've lost\n\n48:58.220 --> 49:01.060\n in something I've wrote, cause I'm so close to it,\n\n49:01.060 --> 49:06.020\n to say, you know, this isn't working and that is working.\n\n49:06.020 --> 49:07.700\n What kind of advice has he given you?\n\n49:07.700 --> 49:09.900\n Is it like layout?\n\n49:09.900 --> 49:12.700\n Like this story doesn't flow correctly.\n\n49:12.700 --> 49:15.180\n Like you shouldn't start at this point.\n\n49:15.180 --> 49:18.580\n Or does he even sit back at a higher level and say,\n\n49:18.580 --> 49:22.460\n I see what you're doing, but you could do better.\n\n49:22.460 --> 49:24.020\n No, he doesn't do that.\n\n49:24.020 --> 49:28.180\n But a lot of it is about genre\n\n49:28.180 --> 49:32.620\n and kind of the defining what genre you're working in.\n\n49:32.620 --> 49:37.140\n And I'm gonna get up here to just bring something over here\n\n49:37.140 --> 49:37.980\n for the camera.\n\n49:39.220 --> 49:42.540\n This was one where Sean tore this down\n\n49:42.540 --> 49:44.540\n and made me start from scratch.\n\n49:44.540 --> 49:47.820\n And what the specifics of it were really,\n\n49:47.820 --> 49:50.140\n this is a supernatural thriller.\n\n49:50.140 --> 49:51.380\n That's the genre.\n\n49:51.380 --> 49:55.980\n Sort of like Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist.\n\n49:55.980 --> 50:00.460\n And what he showed me was that I had violated\n\n50:00.460 --> 50:02.540\n certain conventions of the genre.\n\n50:05.460 --> 50:08.300\n And you just can't do that.\n\n50:08.300 --> 50:12.660\n It's gotta be, it has to be done the right way.\n\n50:12.660 --> 50:17.660\n And so he pointed out certain things to me.\n\n50:18.820 --> 50:22.860\n So he must be a prolific reader himself too, actually.\n\n50:22.860 --> 50:26.060\n That's such a tough job of editor.\n\n50:26.060 --> 50:26.900\n Yeah.\n\n50:26.900 --> 50:28.620\n Again, he was sort of born to do that.\n\n50:28.620 --> 50:30.500\n He just kind of glommed onto it.\n\n50:31.900 --> 50:36.900\n But since he was his first job publishing\n\n50:36.900 --> 50:41.900\n cat thrillers, cat detective books,\n\n50:43.020 --> 50:46.220\n he studied how it works, what makes a story work,\n\n50:46.220 --> 50:47.060\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n50:47.060 --> 50:48.940\n And so he really, he's great.\n\n50:48.940 --> 50:52.340\n And I think any really successful writer,\n\n50:52.340 --> 50:55.300\n unless they're utterly brilliant on their own,\n\n50:55.300 --> 50:57.740\n has gotta have a great editor behind them.\n\n50:57.740 --> 51:00.100\n But you yourself edit as well.\n\n51:00.100 --> 51:03.940\n I'm constantly trying to learn from him and teach myself.\n\n51:03.940 --> 51:07.580\n Everything you see in my blog posts\n\n51:07.580 --> 51:09.460\n that it's about the craft of writing\n\n51:09.460 --> 51:12.860\n is me trying to teach myself the rules\n\n51:12.860 --> 51:15.660\n so that, I'm sure it's the same in martial arts\n\n51:15.660 --> 51:16.860\n or anything else, right?\n\n51:16.860 --> 51:21.740\n You try to not be dependent on that other person\n\n51:21.740 --> 51:24.300\n because it's so painful to make those mistakes.\n\n51:24.300 --> 51:27.060\n You really feel like, ah, I wish I could get it right\n\n51:27.060 --> 51:29.100\n the first time the next time I do it.\n\n51:29.100 --> 51:30.980\n Well, in research, we go through that.\n\n51:30.980 --> 51:33.100\n In research more than writing,\n\n51:33.100 --> 51:35.780\n so what you do is a little more solitary.\n\n51:35.780 --> 51:38.340\n In research, there's usually two, three, four people\n\n51:38.340 --> 51:41.220\n working on something together and we write a paper.\n\n51:41.220 --> 51:44.220\n And there's that painful process of where you write it down\n\n51:44.220 --> 51:46.420\n and then you share it with other.\n\n51:46.420 --> 51:49.940\n And not only do they criticize the writing,\n\n51:49.940 --> 51:53.380\n they criticize the fundamental aspects\n\n51:53.380 --> 51:54.940\n of the approach you've taken.\n\n51:54.940 --> 51:55.780\n I would think so.\n\n51:55.780 --> 51:58.740\n So it's exactly like they would say you're attacking,\n\n51:58.740 --> 52:01.100\n you're asking the wrong questions, right?\n\n52:01.100 --> 52:03.700\n And that's extremely painful, especially when you,\n\n52:03.700 --> 52:06.260\n well, yes, painful and helpful,\n\n52:06.260 --> 52:08.500\n but there's disagreement and so on.\n\n52:09.900 --> 52:12.300\n And through that comes out a better product.\n\n52:12.300 --> 52:15.660\n And if you want to still have an ego,\n\n52:15.660 --> 52:17.940\n but you also want to silence it every once in a while,\n\n52:17.940 --> 52:19.860\n so there's a balance.\n\n52:19.860 --> 52:21.460\n In your book, The War of Art,\n\n52:21.460 --> 52:24.700\n you talk about resistance, what the capital R,\n\n52:24.700 --> 52:27.860\n as the invisible force in this universe of ours\n\n52:27.860 --> 52:32.660\n that finds a way to prevent you from starting\n\n52:32.660 --> 52:34.460\n or doing the work.\n\n52:36.660 --> 52:39.140\n Where do you think resistance comes from?\n\n52:39.140 --> 52:40.860\n Why is there a force in our mind\n\n52:40.860 --> 52:44.060\n that's constantly trying to jeopardize our efforts\n\n52:44.060 --> 52:46.580\n with laziness, excuses, and so on?\n\n52:46.580 --> 52:48.300\n That's another great question.\n\n52:48.300 --> 52:53.180\n I mean, in Jewish mysticism, in Kabbalistic thinking,\n\n52:53.180 --> 52:55.460\n it's called the yetzer hurrah, right?\n\n52:55.460 --> 52:59.540\n And it's a force that if this up here is your soul\n\n52:59.540 --> 53:03.100\n of Neshama trying to talk to you, us down here,\n\n53:03.100 --> 53:06.020\n the yetzer hurrah is this negative force in the middle.\n\n53:06.020 --> 53:08.540\n So I'm not the only one that ever thought about this.\n\n53:08.540 --> 53:11.540\n But, and I don't know if anybody really knows the answer,\n\n53:11.540 --> 53:13.020\n but here's my answer.\n\n53:13.940 --> 53:18.380\n I think that there are two places\n\n53:18.380 --> 53:21.620\n where we as human beings can see our identity.\n\n53:21.620 --> 53:24.900\n One is the ego, the conscious ego,\n\n53:24.900 --> 53:27.460\n and the other is the greater self.\n\n53:27.460 --> 53:30.220\n And the self in the Jungian sense,\n\n53:30.220 --> 53:33.660\n the self in the Jungian sense includes the unconscious\n\n53:33.660 --> 53:37.420\n and butts up against what Jung called the divine ground,\n\n53:37.420 --> 53:40.580\n which what I would call the muse, the goddess, or whatever.\n\n53:40.580 --> 53:43.380\n And I think, and the ego is just this little dot\n\n53:43.380 --> 53:45.460\n inside this bigger self.\n\n53:45.460 --> 53:50.460\n And the ego has a completely different view of life\n\n53:52.500 --> 53:53.700\n from the self.\n\n53:53.700 --> 53:56.980\n The ego believes, I'm gonna give you a long answer here.\n\n53:56.980 --> 53:57.940\n No, perfect.\n\n53:57.940 --> 54:01.300\n The ego believes that death is real.\n\n54:01.300 --> 54:05.180\n The ego believes that time and space are real.\n\n54:05.180 --> 54:07.940\n The ego believes that each one of us\n\n54:07.940 --> 54:09.820\n is separate from the other.\n\n54:09.820 --> 54:11.220\n I'm separate from you.\n\n54:11.220 --> 54:14.380\n If I could punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me,\n\n54:14.380 --> 54:16.220\n it would only hurt you.\n\n54:16.220 --> 54:21.220\n And in the ego's world, the dominant emotion is fear\n\n54:21.500 --> 54:23.460\n because we were all made of flesh.\n\n54:23.460 --> 54:24.300\n We can all die.\n\n54:24.300 --> 54:25.140\n We can all be hurt.\n\n54:25.140 --> 54:26.820\n We can all be ruined.\n\n54:26.820 --> 54:28.420\n So we are protecting ourselves\n\n54:28.420 --> 54:30.940\n and even our desire to create,\n\n54:30.940 --> 54:32.380\n as we were talking about before,\n\n54:32.380 --> 54:33.980\n comes out of that fear of death.\n\n54:35.020 --> 54:37.020\n The self, on the other hand,\n\n54:37.020 --> 54:40.020\n the greater self that butts up against the divine ground\n\n54:40.020 --> 54:42.500\n believes that death is not real,\n\n54:42.500 --> 54:44.980\n that time and space are not real,\n\n54:44.980 --> 54:48.300\n that the gods travel swift as thought.\n\n54:48.300 --> 54:51.380\n And the ego also believes that,\n\n54:51.380 --> 54:53.940\n I mean, the self believes that there's no difference\n\n54:53.940 --> 54:55.500\n between you and me, that we're all one.\n\n54:55.500 --> 55:00.100\n If I hurt you, I hurt myself, karma, right?\n\n55:00.100 --> 55:03.660\n And in the world of the self, of the greater self,\n\n55:03.660 --> 55:06.300\n the dominant emotion is love, not fear.\n\n55:07.180 --> 55:11.340\n Now, so I think that, I'll go farther back here,\n\n55:11.340 --> 55:13.100\n a long way to answer your question.\n\n55:14.220 --> 55:17.540\n When Jesus died on the cross,\n\n55:17.540 --> 55:22.540\n or when the 300 Spartans willingly sacrificed their lives\n\n55:22.940 --> 55:25.020\n at Thermopylae, they were acting\n\n55:25.020 --> 55:27.540\n according to the rules of the self.\n\n55:28.420 --> 55:30.180\n Death is not real.\n\n55:30.180 --> 55:32.380\n No difference between you and me.\n\n55:32.380 --> 55:33.580\n Time and space are not real.\n\n55:33.580 --> 55:36.020\n Predominant emotion is love.\n\n55:36.020 --> 55:38.820\n So, in my opinion,\n\n55:39.860 --> 55:43.260\n we as conscious human vessels\n\n55:44.500 --> 55:46.580\n are in a struggle between these two things,\n\n55:46.580 --> 55:48.180\n the ego and the self.\n\n55:48.180 --> 55:53.180\n To me, resistance is the voice of the ego saying,\n\n55:53.700 --> 55:55.580\n and it's a fearful voice,\n\n55:55.580 --> 56:00.500\n because if, when we identify with the self,\n\n56:00.500 --> 56:03.060\n we move our consciousness over to the self\n\n56:03.060 --> 56:06.660\n as artists or scientists opening ourselves up\n\n56:06.660 --> 56:10.940\n to the cosmic dimension, to the other forces,\n\n56:10.940 --> 56:13.300\n the ego is tremendously threatened by that.\n\n56:13.300 --> 56:18.260\n Because if we're in that space, that head space,\n\n56:18.260 --> 56:20.460\n we don't need the ego anymore.\n\n56:20.460 --> 56:23.940\n So I think resistance is a voice of the ego\n\n56:23.940 --> 56:27.260\n trying to keep control of us.\n\n56:27.260 --> 56:31.540\n In a way, I'll give you a bad example, Trump is the ego.\n\n56:31.540 --> 56:33.860\n That's probably a very good example, right?\n\n56:33.860 --> 56:35.300\n Yeah.\n\n56:35.300 --> 56:38.820\n It's a zero sum world for him,\n\n56:38.820 --> 56:41.340\n and for anybody that's in that.\n\n56:41.340 --> 56:43.940\n And the opposite of that would be somebody\n\n56:43.940 --> 56:46.460\n like Martin Luther King or Gandhi.\n\n56:46.460 --> 56:47.740\n Gandhi, yep.\n\n56:47.740 --> 56:49.380\n And that's, of course, why they all wind up\n\n56:49.380 --> 56:51.260\n getting assassinated.\n\n56:51.260 --> 56:55.260\n Because that voice, that ego, is hanging on to itself\n\n56:55.260 --> 56:59.060\n and feels so threatened by,\n\n57:00.060 --> 57:01.700\n I could talk more about this if you want to.\n\n57:01.700 --> 57:04.140\n No, for sure, that's fascinating.\n\n57:04.140 --> 57:07.940\n It's just, it's interesting why the fear is attached\n\n57:07.940 --> 57:08.940\n to the ego.\n\n57:08.940 --> 57:12.220\n I really like this dichotomy of ego and self\n\n57:12.220 --> 57:14.060\n and that struggle.\n\n57:14.060 --> 57:19.060\n It's just, ego has a, the self obsession of it.\n\n57:20.500 --> 57:25.340\n Why fear is such a predominant thing?\n\n57:25.340 --> 57:29.460\n Why is resistance trying to undermine everything?\n\n57:29.460 --> 57:32.020\n It's fear, it's out of fear.\n\n57:32.020 --> 57:34.740\n Let's think about the whole thing in terms of stories.\n\n57:34.740 --> 57:39.740\n In a story, the villain is always resistance,\n\n57:41.540 --> 57:42.940\n is always the ego.\n\n57:42.940 --> 57:46.940\n The hero is always, of course, always is not everything,\n\n57:46.940 --> 57:47.780\n but you know what I mean?\n\n57:47.780 --> 57:50.580\n Pretty much represents kind of the self.\n\n57:50.580 --> 57:53.660\n If you think about the alien on the spaceship,\n\n57:53.660 --> 57:55.300\n that's like the ultimate kind of villain.\n\n57:55.300 --> 57:57.220\n It keeps changing form, right?\n\n57:57.220 --> 57:58.980\n First it goes on the guy's face,\n\n57:58.980 --> 58:00.820\n then it pops out of his chest,\n\n58:00.820 --> 58:05.340\n but it always just has that one monomaniacal thing\n\n58:05.340 --> 58:07.700\n to destroy, you know?\n\n58:07.700 --> 58:12.580\n And just like the ego, just like resistance.\n\n58:12.580 --> 58:15.540\n And maybe alien is a bad example\n\n58:15.540 --> 58:18.620\n because Sigourney Weaver has to sort of fight\n\n58:18.620 --> 58:20.820\n on the same terms as the alien,\n\n58:20.820 --> 58:23.100\n but maybe a better example might be\n\n58:23.100 --> 58:24.740\n something like Casablanca,\n\n58:24.740 --> 58:28.860\n where in the end, the Humphrey Bogart character\n\n58:28.860 --> 58:32.500\n has to, acting, operating out of the self,\n\n58:32.500 --> 58:37.340\n has to give up his selfish dream\n\n58:37.340 --> 58:39.500\n of going off with Ingrid Bergman,\n\n58:39.500 --> 58:41.460\n Neil Salon, the love of his life,\n\n58:41.460 --> 58:46.260\n and instead, you know, puts her on the plane to Lisbon\n\n58:46.260 --> 58:49.340\n while he goes off to fight the Nazis in the desert.\n\n58:50.420 --> 58:51.260\n I don't know if that's clear,\n\n58:51.260 --> 58:54.820\n but in almost every story,\n\n58:54.820 --> 58:59.420\n the villain is the ego, is resistance, is fear,\n\n58:59.420 --> 59:01.780\n is that zero sum thing.\n\n59:01.780 --> 59:03.340\n And in almost every story,\n\n59:03.340 --> 59:08.260\n the hero is someone that is willing to make a sacrifice\n\n59:09.340 --> 59:10.580\n to help others.\n\n59:11.540 --> 59:13.620\n It's letting go of that fear\n\n59:13.620 --> 59:15.900\n is what leads to productivity and to success.\n\n59:15.900 --> 59:16.740\n Yeah.\n\n59:18.780 --> 59:20.420\n Do you think there's a,\n\n59:20.420 --> 59:25.420\n this is probably the answer is either obvious or impossible,\n\n59:25.900 --> 59:28.740\n but do you think there's an evolutionary advantage\n\n59:28.740 --> 59:31.420\n to resistance?\n\n59:31.420 --> 59:35.780\n Like, what would life look like without resistance?\n\n59:36.740 --> 59:38.420\n That's another great question.\n\n59:38.420 --> 59:43.220\n I think, I also believe that resistance, like death,\n\n59:43.220 --> 59:44.780\n gives meaning to life.\n\n59:44.780 --> 59:48.580\n If we didn't have it, it's gonna be, you know,\n\n59:48.580 --> 59:49.460\n what would we be?\n\n59:49.460 --> 59:51.060\n We'd be in the Garden of Eden,\n\n59:51.060 --> 59:54.980\n picking fruit and just happy and stupid, you know?\n\n59:56.660 --> 59:58.860\n And I do think that that myth of the Garden of Eden\n\n59:58.860 --> 1:00:00.860\n is really about this kind of thing, you know,\n\n1:00:00.860 --> 1:00:04.660\n where Adam and Eve decide to sort of take matters\n\n1:00:04.660 --> 1:00:09.660\n into their own hands and acquire knowledge\n\n1:00:10.180 --> 1:00:12.180\n that until then, God had said,\n\n1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:14.620\n I'm the only one that's got that knowledge.\n\n1:00:14.620 --> 1:00:17.940\n And of course, once they have acquired that knowledge,\n\n1:00:17.940 --> 1:00:21.540\n they're cast out into the world you and I live in now,\n\n1:00:21.540 --> 1:00:23.260\n where they do have to deal with that fear\n\n1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:26.380\n and they do have to deal with all that stuff.\n\n1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:27.820\n The human condition.\n\n1:00:27.820 --> 1:00:31.780\n The human condition and the meaning and the purpose comes\n\n1:00:31.780 --> 1:00:36.700\n from the resistance being there\n\n1:00:36.700 --> 1:00:38.540\n and the struggle to overcome it.\n\n1:00:38.540 --> 1:00:39.940\n To overcome it, right.\n\n1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:42.340\n And also the other aspect of it is that\n\n1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:45.220\n it's not real at all.\n\n1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:48.180\n It's not even like it's an actual force.\n\n1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:50.540\n It's all here, right?\n\n1:00:50.540 --> 1:00:53.140\n So the sort of,\n\n1:00:55.420 --> 1:00:58.260\n in a way, it's sort of a surrender to it, you know?\n\n1:01:00.300 --> 1:01:05.180\n You know, or it's just a sort of like turning on the light\n\n1:01:05.180 --> 1:01:06.020\n in a dark thing.\n\n1:01:06.020 --> 1:01:07.180\n It's like, oh, it's gone.\n\n1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:11.420\n But not quite because it's never really.\n\n1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:13.260\n Because it comes back again tomorrow morning.\n\n1:01:13.260 --> 1:01:14.100\n Exactly.\n\n1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:17.780\n So you have to keep changing light bulbs every day.\n\n1:01:17.780 --> 1:01:20.820\n So what's been, maybe recently, but in general,\n\n1:01:20.820 --> 1:01:24.180\n maybe in your life, what's been the most relentless\n\n1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:26.820\n or one of the more relentless sources of resistance\n\n1:01:26.820 --> 1:01:28.220\n to you personally?\n\n1:01:28.220 --> 1:01:30.620\n I mean, it's always the same.\n\n1:01:30.620 --> 1:01:32.220\n It's about writing for me\n\n1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:38.660\n and evolving within my own body of work, you know?\n\n1:01:38.660 --> 1:01:43.660\n It never goes away, it never gets any less.\n\n1:01:43.860 --> 1:01:45.540\n Do you have particular excuses,\n\n1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:49.900\n particular justifications that come out?\n\n1:01:49.900 --> 1:01:51.540\n No, it's always the same.\n\n1:01:51.540 --> 1:01:53.260\n Well, I would say it's always the same,\n\n1:01:53.260 --> 1:01:56.260\n but it's really not because resistance is so protean,\n\n1:01:56.260 --> 1:01:58.340\n you know, it keeps changing form.\n\n1:01:58.340 --> 1:02:02.460\n And as you move to hopefully a higher level,\n\n1:02:02.460 --> 1:02:04.460\n resistance gets a little more nuanced\n\n1:02:04.460 --> 1:02:07.220\n and a little more subtle trying to fake you out.\n\n1:02:07.220 --> 1:02:11.980\n But I think you learn that it's always there\n\n1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:14.380\n and you're always gonna have to face it, so.\n\n1:02:14.380 --> 1:02:18.780\n I mean, your battle is sitting down\n\n1:02:18.780 --> 1:02:22.940\n and writing to some number of words to a blank page.\n\n1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:28.060\n Do you have a process there with this battle?\n\n1:02:28.060 --> 1:02:31.500\n Do you have a number of hours that you put in?\n\n1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:32.340\n Do you sit down?\n\n1:02:32.340 --> 1:02:34.940\n Yeah, I'm definitely a believer\n\n1:02:34.940 --> 1:02:37.460\n that even though this battle is fought\n\n1:02:37.460 --> 1:02:40.060\n on the highest sort of spiritual level,\n\n1:02:40.060 --> 1:02:43.060\n that the way you fight it is on the most mundane,\n\n1:02:44.060 --> 1:02:46.860\n I'm sure it's like martial arts, must be the same way.\n\n1:02:46.860 --> 1:02:49.980\n I mean, I go to the gym first thing in the morning\n\n1:02:49.980 --> 1:02:53.180\n and I sort of am rehearsing myself.\n\n1:02:54.900 --> 1:02:57.180\n The gym is called resistance training, right?\n\n1:02:57.180 --> 1:02:59.180\n You're working against resistance, right?\n\n1:02:59.180 --> 1:03:01.620\n And I don't wanna go, I don't wanna get out of bed,\n\n1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:06.580\n I hate that, but I'm sort of fortifying myself\n\n1:03:06.580 --> 1:03:09.700\n to be ready for the day.\n\n1:03:09.700 --> 1:03:13.740\n And like I said, over Knockwood, over years,\n\n1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:17.100\n I've learned to sort of get into the right kind of mindset\n\n1:03:17.100 --> 1:03:20.060\n and it's not as hard for me as it used to be.\n\n1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:22.180\n The real resistance, I think, for me,\n\n1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:23.580\n and I think this is true for anybody,\n\n1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:26.860\n is the question of sort of what's the next idea?\n\n1:03:27.820 --> 1:03:29.100\n What's the next book?\n\n1:03:29.100 --> 1:03:31.500\n What's the next project that you're gonna work on?\n\n1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:35.820\n And when I ask that question, I'm asking it of the muse.\n\n1:03:35.820 --> 1:03:38.020\n I'm kind of saying, what do you want me,\n\n1:03:38.020 --> 1:03:40.420\n or I'm asking it of my unconscious.\n\n1:03:40.420 --> 1:03:43.260\n If we're looking at Bruce Springsteen's albums,\n\n1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:45.060\n it's kind of, well, what's the next album?\n\n1:03:45.060 --> 1:03:46.420\n Now he's on Broadway.\n\n1:03:46.420 --> 1:03:47.980\n That was a great idea, right?\n\n1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.900\n Where'd that come from, you know?\n\n1:03:51.900 --> 1:03:55.740\n But, and then for him, what's after that, you know?\n\n1:03:55.740 --> 1:04:00.740\n Because that body of work is already alive.\n\n1:04:03.980 --> 1:04:07.020\n It already exists inside us,\n\n1:04:07.020 --> 1:04:09.460\n kind of like a woman's biological clock,\n\n1:04:10.340 --> 1:04:12.340\n and we have to serve it.\n\n1:04:12.340 --> 1:04:16.540\n And we have to, otherwise it'll give us cancer, you know?\n\n1:04:17.740 --> 1:04:19.460\n I don't mean to say that if anybody has cancer\n\n1:04:19.460 --> 1:04:21.180\n that they're not, you know what I mean?\n\n1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:24.060\n It'll take its revenge on us.\n\n1:04:24.060 --> 1:04:26.300\n So the next resistance to me is sort of,\n\n1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:30.100\n or a big aspect of it is, what's next?\n\n1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:31.780\n You know, when I finish the book I'm working on now,\n\n1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:33.460\n I'm not sure what I'm gonna do next.\n\n1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:35.900\n And I see at the same time you have a kind of,\n\n1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:42.660\n you have a sense that there's a Bruce Springsteen\n\n1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:45.980\n single line of albums.\n\n1:04:45.980 --> 1:04:49.420\n So like, it's already known somewhere in the universe\n\n1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:51.900\n what you're going to do next, is the sense you have.\n\n1:04:51.900 --> 1:04:53.460\n In a sense, yes.\n\n1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:55.940\n I don't know if it's predetermined, you know?\n\n1:04:55.940 --> 1:04:58.420\n But there's something like that.\n\n1:05:00.220 --> 1:05:03.380\n Yeah, I'd like to believe that there's,\n\n1:05:03.380 --> 1:05:06.460\n well, it's kind of like quantum mechanics, I guess.\n\n1:05:06.460 --> 1:05:11.020\n Once you observe it, maybe once you talk to the muse,\n\n1:05:11.020 --> 1:05:13.580\n it's one thing for sure.\n\n1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:15.540\n It was always going to be that one thing.\n\n1:05:15.540 --> 1:05:19.260\n But really, in reality, it's a distribution.\n\n1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:20.780\n It could be any number of things.\n\n1:05:20.780 --> 1:05:21.620\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n1:05:21.620 --> 1:05:22.820\n There's alternate realities.\n\n1:05:22.820 --> 1:05:24.100\n Alternate realities, yeah.\n\n1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:25.460\n But they're not that far apart.\n\n1:05:25.460 --> 1:05:28.260\n I mean, Bruce Springsteen is not gonna write\n\n1:05:28.260 --> 1:05:30.620\n a Joni Mitchell song, you know?\n\n1:05:30.620 --> 1:05:31.460\n No matter how hard he tries.\n\n1:05:31.460 --> 1:05:32.420\n But he still went on Broadway.\n\n1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:33.860\n I mean, he still did that,\n\n1:05:33.860 --> 1:05:36.320\n which is not a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.\n\n1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:39.940\n So I think you're being, in retrospect,\n\n1:05:39.940 --> 1:05:40.780\n it all makes sense. I think it is\n\n1:05:40.780 --> 1:05:41.860\n a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.\n\n1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:43.740\n It's a next sort of evolution for him.\n\n1:05:43.740 --> 1:05:46.860\n Why not take his music to there, you know?\n\n1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:50.340\n In retrospect, it all makes perfect sense, I think.\n\n1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:51.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:51.180 --> 1:05:53.080\n If you pull it off, especially.\n\n1:05:54.100 --> 1:05:57.620\n Do you visualize yourself completing the work?\n\n1:05:57.620 --> 1:06:01.140\n Like, Olympic athletes visualize getting the gold medal.\n\n1:06:02.780 --> 1:06:06.080\n Do you, you know, they go through,\n\n1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:08.260\n I mean, that's actually a really,\n\n1:06:08.260 --> 1:06:09.940\n you can learn something from athletes on that,\n\n1:06:09.940 --> 1:06:12.340\n is years out,\n\n1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:15.260\n certainly two, three years out,\n\n1:06:15.260 --> 1:06:16.620\n some people do much longer,\n\n1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:19.500\n every day, you visualize how the day\n\n1:06:19.500 --> 1:06:24.060\n of the championship will go down to,\n\n1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:25.980\n I mean, everything, down to how will it feel\n\n1:06:25.980 --> 1:06:27.900\n to stand on the podium and so on.\n\n1:06:27.900 --> 1:06:29.860\n Do you do anything like that\n\n1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:31.260\n in how you approach writing?\n\n1:06:31.260 --> 1:06:32.260\n No.\n\n1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:33.580\n Because it's. It's always in the moment.\n\n1:06:33.580 --> 1:06:35.700\n Because, yeah, it is in the moment, I think.\n\n1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:36.860\n Because it's such a mystery.\n\n1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:37.700\n You just don't know.\n\n1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:39.260\n I think it's different from sports.\n\n1:06:39.260 --> 1:06:40.700\n Right.\n\n1:06:40.700 --> 1:06:41.700\n Because you don't know the destiny.\n\n1:06:41.700 --> 1:06:43.700\n There's no gold medal at the end.\n\n1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:44.540\n No.\n\n1:06:44.540 --> 1:06:48.540\n In fact, I would like to think that\n\n1:06:48.540 --> 1:06:50.300\n as soon as you finish one,\n\n1:06:51.220 --> 1:06:53.580\n the next day you're on the other.\n\n1:06:53.580 --> 1:06:56.460\n And in fact, hopefully you've already started the other.\n\n1:06:56.460 --> 1:07:00.900\n You're already, you know, 100 pages into the other\n\n1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:03.220\n when you finish the first one.\n\n1:07:03.220 --> 1:07:04.860\n But it is a, it is a,\n\n1:07:08.620 --> 1:07:10.060\n it's a journey, it's a process.\n\n1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:11.540\n I don't think it is a,\n\n1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:14.340\n in fact, I think it's very dangerous to think that way.\n\n1:07:14.340 --> 1:07:19.340\n To think, oh, this, I'm gonna win the Oscar, you know?\n\n1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:21.900\n It's interesting.\n\n1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:24.780\n For the creative process, it might be dangerous.\n\n1:07:24.780 --> 1:07:29.060\n It's a, maybe you can, like, why is that dangerous?\n\n1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:30.900\n Because I kind of know where you're coming from.\n\n1:07:30.900 --> 1:07:32.220\n Because it's the ego.\n\n1:07:32.220 --> 1:07:33.060\n It's the ego.\n\n1:07:33.060 --> 1:07:34.980\n Because you're giving yourself over to the ego.\n\n1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:38.740\n You know, I keep saying this myself.\n\n1:07:38.740 --> 1:07:41.580\n My job, I'm a servant of the muse.\n\n1:07:41.580 --> 1:07:44.820\n I'm there to do what she tells me to do.\n\n1:07:44.820 --> 1:07:48.220\n And if I suddenly think, oh, I'm really,\n\n1:07:48.220 --> 1:07:50.100\n I just wanna, you know, whatever,\n\n1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:51.740\n the muse doesn't like that.\n\n1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:56.660\n And, you know, and she's on another dimension from me.\n\n1:07:58.220 --> 1:08:01.260\n I'm trying to square that, because I agree.\n\n1:08:01.260 --> 1:08:03.060\n I'm trying to square that with the,\n\n1:08:04.300 --> 1:08:07.900\n I think there's a meditation to visualizing success\n\n1:08:07.900 --> 1:08:12.820\n in the athletic realm, to where it focuses,\n\n1:08:12.820 --> 1:08:15.500\n it removes everything else away,\n\n1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:18.180\n to where you focus on this particular battle.\n\n1:08:18.180 --> 1:08:23.180\n I mean, I think that you can do that in many kinds of ways.\n\n1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:28.620\n And in sports, the ego serves a more important role,\n\n1:08:29.940 --> 1:08:31.580\n I think, than it does in writing.\n\n1:08:31.580 --> 1:08:33.860\n And the ego, there's something.\n\n1:08:33.860 --> 1:08:35.940\n Well, let me, when you say that,\n\n1:08:35.940 --> 1:08:39.100\n I know what you mean, Lex, and I do think there is\n\n1:08:39.100 --> 1:08:43.180\n a sort of a, you know, it's interesting to watch interviews\n\n1:08:43.180 --> 1:08:47.980\n with Steph Curry, who's such, obviously such a nice guy,\n\n1:08:49.780 --> 1:08:54.500\n but he's got such tremendous self confidence,\n\n1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:58.460\n you know, that it, but it doesn't border on ego so much\n\n1:08:58.460 --> 1:09:01.060\n because he's worked so hard for it, you know?\n\n1:09:01.060 --> 1:09:04.420\n But he knows, so he has visualized.\n\n1:09:04.420 --> 1:09:08.100\n He has visualized maybe not so much winning, you know,\n\n1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:11.740\n as just him being the best he can be,\n\n1:09:11.740 --> 1:09:15.500\n him being in the flow, you know,\n\n1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:18.420\n doing his thing that he knows he can do.\n\n1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:21.260\n And I do think in the creative world,\n\n1:09:21.260 --> 1:09:23.140\n yeah, there is a sort of a thing like that,\n\n1:09:23.140 --> 1:09:27.180\n where you, where, and, you know,\n\n1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:29.700\n a choreographer or a filmmaker or whatever\n\n1:09:29.700 --> 1:09:34.700\n might be, do an internal thing where they're saying,\n\n1:09:35.380 --> 1:09:36.980\n I can make an Oscar winning movie.\n\n1:09:36.980 --> 1:09:38.700\n I can direct this movie.\n\n1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:40.700\n You know, I'm banishing these thoughts\n\n1:09:40.700 --> 1:09:42.020\n that I'm not good enough.\n\n1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:42.860\n I can do that.\n\n1:09:42.860 --> 1:09:44.220\n I can edit it.\n\n1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:45.420\n I can score it.\n\n1:09:45.420 --> 1:09:47.500\n I can, you know, bump it, bump it, bump.\n\n1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:49.380\n But, and I don't think that's really ego.\n\n1:09:49.380 --> 1:09:53.580\n I think that's part of the process in a good way,\n\n1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:55.180\n like an athlete does that.\n\n1:09:55.180 --> 1:09:58.140\n So extreme confidence is what some of the best athletes\n\n1:09:58.140 --> 1:10:02.020\n come with, and you think it's possible to,\n\n1:10:02.020 --> 1:10:04.740\n as a writer, to have extreme confidence in yourself?\n\n1:10:04.740 --> 1:10:07.500\n I do think so, you know, that I'm sure\n\n1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:11.420\n when John Lennon sat down to write a song,\n\n1:10:11.420 --> 1:10:14.260\n he felt like, shit, I can do this, you know?\n\n1:10:14.260 --> 1:10:16.020\n I'm not so sure.\n\n1:10:16.020 --> 1:10:19.660\n I think, because the great artists I've seen,\n\n1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:23.340\n and you're haunted by self doubt.\n\n1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:26.020\n It's that resist, I mean, the confidence.\n\n1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:29.100\n Yes, but I mean, I guess, but even beyond the self,\n\n1:10:29.100 --> 1:10:30.940\n within the self, above the self doubt.\n\n1:10:30.940 --> 1:10:33.900\n Oh, it's the bigger picture of the self belief, you know?\n\n1:10:33.900 --> 1:10:35.100\n Yeah, I'm freaking out.\n\n1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:36.860\n Yeah, I'm worried that I'm not gonna be able to do it.\n\n1:10:36.860 --> 1:10:38.460\n But, you know, I know I can do this.\n\n1:10:38.460 --> 1:10:39.500\n Yeah, and when you look at,\n\n1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:41.860\n when you take a bigger picture of it.\n\n1:10:41.860 --> 1:10:46.860\n So the writing process, is it fundamentally lonely?\n\n1:10:48.780 --> 1:10:53.540\n No, because you're with your characters.\n\n1:10:53.540 --> 1:10:55.700\n You are.\n\n1:10:55.700 --> 1:10:58.300\n So you really put yourself in the world.\n\n1:10:58.300 --> 1:11:02.420\n Absolutely, you know, I've written about this before\n\n1:11:02.420 --> 1:11:04.740\n that I used to, my desk used to face a wall\n\n1:11:04.740 --> 1:11:06.460\n instead of seeing, and people would say,\n\n1:11:06.460 --> 1:11:08.340\n well, don't you wanna look out the window?\n\n1:11:08.340 --> 1:11:11.900\n But I'm in here, I mean, I'm seeing, you know,\n\n1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:14.700\n the Spartans, I'm seeing, you know, whatever.\n\n1:11:14.700 --> 1:11:18.500\n And the characters that are on the page,\n\n1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:22.300\n or that you create, are not accidents, you know?\n\n1:11:22.300 --> 1:11:24.820\n They're coming out of some issue,\n\n1:11:24.820 --> 1:11:27.300\n some deep issue that you have.\n\n1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:28.380\n Whether you realize it or not,\n\n1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:30.260\n you might not realize it till 20 years later,\n\n1:11:30.260 --> 1:11:31.900\n or somebody explains it to you.\n\n1:11:31.900 --> 1:11:35.180\n So your characters are kind of fascinating to you.\n\n1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.340\n And their dilemmas are fascinating to you.\n\n1:11:38.340 --> 1:11:42.820\n And you're also trying to come to grips with them,\n\n1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:46.300\n you know, you sort of see them through a glass darkly,\n\n1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:49.100\n you know, and you really wanna see them more clearly.\n\n1:11:49.100 --> 1:11:52.260\n So yeah, no, it's not lonely at all.\n\n1:11:52.260 --> 1:11:55.180\n In fact, I'm more lonely sometimes later,\n\n1:11:55.180 --> 1:11:56.620\n going out to dinner with some people\n\n1:11:56.620 --> 1:11:58.180\n and actually talking to people.\n\n1:11:59.300 --> 1:12:02.540\n Do you miss the characters after it's over?\n\n1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:06.340\n Let's say I have affection for them,\n\n1:12:06.340 --> 1:12:09.220\n kind of like children that have gone off to college\n\n1:12:09.220 --> 1:12:12.500\n and now are, you know, you only see them at Thanksgiving.\n\n1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:17.500\n Definitely, I have affection for them, even the bad guys.\n\n1:12:18.860 --> 1:12:22.500\n Maybe especially the bad guys.\n\n1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:23.700\n Especially the bad guys.\n\n1:12:25.540 --> 1:12:29.060\n You've said that writers, even successful writers,\n\n1:12:29.060 --> 1:12:32.300\n are often not tough minded enough.\n\n1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:34.540\n I've read that in the post,\n\n1:12:34.540 --> 1:12:35.820\n that you have to be a professional\n\n1:12:35.820 --> 1:12:38.500\n in the way you handle your emotions.\n\n1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:41.740\n You have to be a bit of a warrior to be a writer.\n\n1:12:41.740 --> 1:12:46.740\n So what do you think makes a warrior?\n\n1:12:47.340 --> 1:12:51.580\n Is a warrior born or trained in the realm,\n\n1:12:51.580 --> 1:12:53.780\n in the bigger realm, in the realm of writing,\n\n1:12:53.780 --> 1:12:55.100\n in the creative process?\n\n1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:57.580\n I think they're born to some extent.\n\n1:12:57.580 --> 1:12:59.820\n You have the gift, like you might have the gift\n\n1:12:59.820 --> 1:13:02.820\n as a martial artist to do whatever martial artists do,\n\n1:13:02.820 --> 1:13:05.140\n but the training is the big thing.\n\n1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:09.100\n 90% training, 10%, 10% genetics.\n\n1:13:09.100 --> 1:13:13.740\n And, you know, I use another analogy other than warrior\n\n1:13:13.740 --> 1:13:16.580\n as far as writer, and that's like to be a mother.\n\n1:13:16.580 --> 1:13:19.220\n If you think about, if you're a writer\n\n1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:21.420\n or any creative person, you're giving birth to something,\n\n1:13:21.420 --> 1:13:23.860\n right, you're carrying a new life inside you.\n\n1:13:23.860 --> 1:13:26.900\n And in terms of bravery,\n\n1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:30.460\n if your child, your two year old child\n\n1:13:30.460 --> 1:13:33.620\n is underneath a car that's coming down the street,\n\n1:13:33.620 --> 1:13:35.780\n the mother's gonna like stop a Buick,\n\n1:13:35.780 --> 1:13:37.900\n you know, with her bare hands.\n\n1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:41.220\n So that's another way to think about\n\n1:13:41.220 --> 1:13:43.380\n how a writer has to think about,\n\n1:13:43.380 --> 1:13:45.620\n or any creative person has to think about,\n\n1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:47.260\n I think, what they're doing,\n\n1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:50.220\n what this child, this new creation\n\n1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:51.580\n that they're bringing forth.\n\n1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:57.100\n Yeah, so the hard work that's underlying that.\n\n1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:59.780\n I've just, a couple weeks ago, talked to,\n\n1:14:00.620 --> 1:14:01.860\n just happened to be in the same room,\n\n1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:03.940\n both gave talks, Arianna Huffington.\n\n1:14:03.940 --> 1:14:08.180\n I did this conversation with her.\n\n1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:11.100\n I didn't know much about her before then,\n\n1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:14.420\n but she has recently been, she wrote a couple books\n\n1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:16.140\n and been promoting a lifestyle\n\n1:14:16.980 --> 1:14:20.180\n where she basically, she created the Huffington Post,\n\n1:14:20.180 --> 1:14:23.140\n and she gave herself like, I don't know,\n\n1:14:23.140 --> 1:14:26.340\n 20 hours a day just obsessed with her work.\n\n1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:29.260\n And then she fainted, passed out,\n\n1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:31.620\n and kind of, there was some health issues.\n\n1:14:31.620 --> 1:14:36.140\n And so she wrote this book saying that, you know, sleep,\n\n1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:38.860\n basically you wanna establish a lifestyle\n\n1:14:38.860 --> 1:14:41.320\n that doesn't sacrifice health,\n\n1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:43.420\n that's productive but doesn't sacrifice health.\n\n1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:44.620\n She thinks that you can have both,\n\n1:14:44.620 --> 1:14:46.380\n productivity and health.\n\n1:14:46.380 --> 1:14:49.780\n Criticizing Elon Musk, who I've also spoken with,\n\n1:14:49.780 --> 1:14:51.820\n for working too hard,\n\n1:14:51.820 --> 1:14:56.820\n and thereby sacrificing, you know,\n\n1:14:56.820 --> 1:14:59.380\n being less effective than he could be.\n\n1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:04.380\n So I'm trying to get this balance between health\n\n1:15:04.420 --> 1:15:06.780\n and obsessively working at something\n\n1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:09.060\n and really working hard.\n\n1:15:09.060 --> 1:15:12.100\n So what Arianna is talking about makes sense to me,\n\n1:15:12.100 --> 1:15:13.540\n but I'm a little bit torn.\n\n1:15:13.540 --> 1:15:17.100\n To me, passion and reason do not overlap much\n\n1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:19.080\n or at all sometimes.\n\n1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:20.340\n Maybe I'm being too Russian,\n\n1:15:20.340 --> 1:15:25.340\n but I feel madness and obsession does not care for health\n\n1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:28.580\n or sleep or diet or any of that.\n\n1:15:28.580 --> 1:15:32.220\n And hard work is hard work,\n\n1:15:32.220 --> 1:15:34.180\n and everything else can go to hell.\n\n1:15:34.180 --> 1:15:37.420\n So if you're really focused on whether it's writing a book,\n\n1:15:37.420 --> 1:15:39.820\n it should, everything should just go to hell.\n\n1:15:40.860 --> 1:15:43.120\n Where do you stand on this balance?\n\n1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:45.280\n How important is health for productivity?\n\n1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:49.300\n How important is it to sort of get sleep and so on?\n\n1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.320\n I'm on the health side.\n\n1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:54.940\n I mean, there was a period of my life\n\n1:15:54.940 --> 1:15:59.940\n when I was just, I had no obligations\n\n1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:02.260\n and I was just living in a little house\n\n1:16:02.260 --> 1:16:05.300\n and just working nonstop, you know?\n\n1:16:05.300 --> 1:16:07.220\n But even then I would get up in the morning\n\n1:16:07.220 --> 1:16:10.940\n and I would have liver and eggs for breakfast every day,\n\n1:16:10.940 --> 1:16:13.760\n and I would do my, you know, exercise, whatever it was.\n\n1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:16.800\n But although I was still doing like 18 hours a day,\n\n1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:20.380\n but I'm definitely, I kind of think of it\n\n1:16:20.380 --> 1:16:22.140\n sort of like an athlete does.\n\n1:16:22.140 --> 1:16:27.140\n I'm sure that like Steph Curry is totally committed\n\n1:16:27.620 --> 1:16:29.940\n to winning championships and stuff like that.\n\n1:16:29.940 --> 1:16:31.640\n But he has his family, he sees his family,\n\n1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:33.700\n you know, the family is always there.\n\n1:16:33.700 --> 1:16:38.700\n He, I'm sure he eats, you know, perfect, great stuff,\n\n1:16:38.900 --> 1:16:43.700\n gets his sleep, you know, gets the training,\n\n1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:45.300\n you know, the whatever a trainer does to him\n\n1:16:45.300 --> 1:16:47.320\n for his knees and his ankles and whatever.\n\n1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:49.820\n So I, or Kobe Bryant or anybody\n\n1:16:49.820 --> 1:16:52.580\n that's operating at a high level.\n\n1:16:52.580 --> 1:16:55.020\n So I do think I'm from that kind of the health school.\n\n1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:57.500\n The good thing about being a writer\n\n1:16:57.500 --> 1:17:00.820\n is you can't work very many hours a day.\n\n1:17:00.820 --> 1:17:03.820\n You know, four hours is like the maximum I can work.\n\n1:17:03.820 --> 1:17:05.580\n I've never been able to work more than that.\n\n1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:06.820\n I don't know how people do it.\n\n1:17:06.820 --> 1:17:11.220\n I've heard of people do 10, 12, I don't know how they do it.\n\n1:17:11.220 --> 1:17:14.780\n So that gives you a lot of other time to do it.\n\n1:17:14.780 --> 1:17:16.180\n Optimize your health.\n\n1:17:16.180 --> 1:17:17.020\n Yeah, to optimize your health.\n\n1:17:17.020 --> 1:17:19.020\n Because you need to, you're in training, you know?\n\n1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:22.260\n You're really, you're burning up a lot of B vitamins\n\n1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:24.500\n when you're working here, aren't you?\n\n1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:25.500\n Yeah, but.\n\n1:17:27.020 --> 1:17:28.860\n Maybe it's a Russian thing with you, Lex.\n\n1:17:28.860 --> 1:17:30.460\n Well, it's not even a Russian thing.\n\n1:17:30.460 --> 1:17:32.260\n It also may be youth, you know?\n\n1:17:32.260 --> 1:17:35.380\n At 35, you can be crazy.\n\n1:17:35.380 --> 1:17:38.060\n You know, that's the thing, they keep telling me,\n\n1:17:38.060 --> 1:17:43.060\n but I'm pretty sure I'll be added still at a later time too.\n\n1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:47.100\n I think it has to do with the career choice too.\n\n1:17:47.100 --> 1:17:51.580\n I think writing is almost, from everything I've heard,\n\n1:17:51.580 --> 1:17:52.700\n it's almost impossible to do it\n\n1:17:52.700 --> 1:17:55.860\n more than a few hours really well.\n\n1:17:56.860 --> 1:17:58.820\n When you start to get into certain disciplines,\n\n1:17:58.820 --> 1:18:02.660\n like with Elon Musk and me, engineering disciplines,\n\n1:18:02.660 --> 1:18:07.660\n that really there's a lot more non muse time needed.\n\n1:18:09.300 --> 1:18:10.140\n Right, right, right.\n\n1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:17.140\n So the crazy hours that you often are talking about\n\n1:18:17.140 --> 1:18:20.660\n have to be done, and it doesn't.\n\n1:18:20.660 --> 1:18:22.260\n I think that's true.\n\n1:18:22.260 --> 1:18:26.060\n Yeah, so there's still the two, three hours of muse time\n\n1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:27.820\n needed for truly genius ideas,\n\n1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:32.820\n but it's something I certainly struggle with.\n\n1:18:34.620 --> 1:18:39.500\n But yeah, I hear you loud and clear on the health.\n\n1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:44.180\n So what does a perfect day look like for you\n\n1:18:44.180 --> 1:18:46.740\n if we're talking about writing?\n\n1:18:46.740 --> 1:18:49.180\n An hour by hour schedule of a perfect day.\n\n1:18:51.340 --> 1:18:54.340\n I get up early, I go to the gym,\n\n1:18:54.340 --> 1:18:57.380\n I have breakfast with some friends of mine.\n\n1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:58.660\n What's early by the way?\n\n1:18:58.660 --> 1:19:00.180\n Let's, like how early?\n\n1:19:00.180 --> 1:19:01.020\n 3.15.\n\n1:19:02.020 --> 1:19:02.860\n A.M.\n\n1:19:02.860 --> 1:19:03.820\n A.M.\n\n1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:05.300\n So we're talking really early.\n\n1:19:05.300 --> 1:19:06.180\n Really early.\n\n1:19:06.180 --> 1:19:08.980\n Now I'm crazy early, it's ridiculously early.\n\n1:19:08.980 --> 1:19:10.900\n But, and I haven't done that always,\n\n1:19:10.900 --> 1:19:13.700\n but that's kind of what I'm on now.\n\n1:19:15.740 --> 1:19:19.140\n So I'm in bed, like when I'm with my nephews\n\n1:19:19.140 --> 1:19:21.260\n that are like four years old and three years old,\n\n1:19:21.260 --> 1:19:22.660\n I'm in bed before them.\n\n1:19:22.660 --> 1:19:25.020\n Okay, you got a beat.\n\n1:19:25.020 --> 1:19:28.340\n You wake up, sorry, you said exercise first.\n\n1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:29.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:30.780\n And what does that look like?\n\n1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:32.100\n What's exercise for you?\n\n1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:32.940\n You go out to the gym?\n\n1:19:32.940 --> 1:19:33.780\n I go to the gym.\n\n1:19:35.220 --> 1:19:37.380\n I have a trainer, I have a couple of guys\n\n1:19:37.380 --> 1:19:40.980\n that I work out with, and I'll, you know,\n\n1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:43.180\n it's maybe an hour, maybe a little more.\n\n1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:45.660\n I'll do a little warmup before stretching afterwards,\n\n1:19:45.660 --> 1:19:47.380\n take a shower, go have breakfast.\n\n1:19:49.260 --> 1:19:51.620\n But it's an intense kind of a thing\n\n1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:55.860\n that I definitely don't wanna do that's hard, you know?\n\n1:19:55.860 --> 1:19:57.980\n So you feel like you've accomplished something, first thing.\n\n1:19:57.980 --> 1:19:58.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:00.460\n That's a big accomplishment of the day.\n\n1:20:00.460 --> 1:20:02.540\n At the same time, it's not like so hard\n\n1:20:02.540 --> 1:20:04.940\n that I'm completely exhausted, you know?\n\n1:20:04.940 --> 1:20:09.940\n And then I'll come home and handle whatever correspondence\n\n1:20:10.100 --> 1:20:11.580\n and stuff has to be done, and then I work\n\n1:20:11.580 --> 1:20:15.580\n for maybe three hours, and then I just sort of crash.\n\n1:20:15.580 --> 1:20:18.900\n The office is closed, I turn the switch,\n\n1:20:18.900 --> 1:20:21.340\n I don't think about anything.\n\n1:20:21.340 --> 1:20:23.420\n I don't think about the work at all.\n\n1:20:23.420 --> 1:20:25.660\n Do you listen to, oh, you mean afterwards?\n\n1:20:25.660 --> 1:20:27.620\n After work, once the office is closed.\n\n1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:31.020\n But during, so this was like 12 to three kind of thing?\n\n1:20:31.020 --> 1:20:31.860\n Something like that, yeah.\n\n1:20:31.860 --> 1:20:33.540\n Something like that, okay.\n\n1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:34.660\n You listen to music?\n\n1:20:34.660 --> 1:20:35.500\n No.\n\n1:20:35.500 --> 1:20:36.340\n Do you have anything?\n\n1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:38.500\n But that's just me, I mean, I don't think, you know,\n\n1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:40.500\n but somebody could do it a million different ways.\n\n1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:42.380\n It's fascinating, you know, the,\n\n1:20:43.580 --> 1:20:47.820\n I mean, you've also, of most, of many writers,\n\n1:20:47.820 --> 1:20:51.900\n you've really, but like I've read Stephen Kington writing,\n\n1:20:51.900 --> 1:20:55.180\n you've optimized this conversation\n\n1:20:55.180 --> 1:20:56.420\n with the muse you're having.\n\n1:20:56.420 --> 1:20:59.700\n Not optimized, but you've at least thought about it.\n\n1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:02.660\n So what's, can you say a little bit more\n\n1:21:02.660 --> 1:21:05.900\n about the trivialities of that process,\n\n1:21:05.900 --> 1:21:10.700\n of the, like you said, facing the wall?\n\n1:21:10.700 --> 1:21:13.340\n What's, do you have little rituals?\n\n1:21:13.340 --> 1:21:15.300\n You mean like the granular aspect of it?\n\n1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:17.020\n The granular aspects, yeah.\n\n1:21:19.540 --> 1:21:20.380\n Is there?\n\n1:21:20.380 --> 1:21:21.740\n I do have little rituals, I do have all kinds of,\n\n1:21:21.740 --> 1:21:22.940\n which I'm not even gonna tell you about.\n\n1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:23.780\n Sure.\n\n1:21:23.780 --> 1:21:27.660\n But the one thing,\n\n1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:30.740\n and I don't wanna like talk about this too much\n\n1:21:30.740 --> 1:21:32.460\n because it sort of jinxes things, I think,\n\n1:21:32.460 --> 1:21:37.140\n but the one thing I do try to do is when I sit down,\n\n1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:41.060\n I immediately get into it, first, second.\n\n1:21:41.060 --> 1:21:43.660\n I don't sit and fuck around with anything.\n\n1:21:43.660 --> 1:21:47.300\n I immediately try to get into it as quickly as I can.\n\n1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:50.180\n The other thing is that writing a book\n\n1:21:50.180 --> 1:21:51.420\n or screenplay or anything like that\n\n1:21:51.420 --> 1:21:54.060\n is a process of multiple drafts.\n\n1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:56.060\n And it's the first draft\n\n1:21:56.060 --> 1:21:58.780\n that's where you're most with the muse,\n\n1:21:58.780 --> 1:22:00.620\n where you're going through the blank page.\n\n1:22:00.620 --> 1:22:02.820\n Like right now I'm on, I don't know what,\n\n1:22:02.820 --> 1:22:04.260\n the fifth or sixth, seventh draft\n\n1:22:04.260 --> 1:22:05.860\n of the thing I'm working on.\n\n1:22:05.860 --> 1:22:09.260\n So I've got pages already written\n\n1:22:09.260 --> 1:22:12.140\n and I'm kind of reading them afresh\n\n1:22:12.140 --> 1:22:14.820\n as I go through the story.\n\n1:22:14.820 --> 1:22:17.460\n So it's not quite where I am now.\n\n1:22:17.460 --> 1:22:22.460\n It's not quite a deep muse scenario, partly it is,\n\n1:22:22.540 --> 1:22:25.900\n but it's also sort of bouncing back and forth\n\n1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:27.100\n between the different,\n\n1:22:27.100 --> 1:22:28.500\n between the right brain and the left brain.\n\n1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:29.500\n I'm kind of looking at it\n\n1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:31.620\n and trying to evaluate it.\n\n1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:33.060\n And then I'm going into it\n\n1:22:33.060 --> 1:22:35.140\n and try to change it a little bit.\n\n1:22:35.140 --> 1:22:37.100\n And when, do you know,\n\n1:22:37.100 --> 1:22:38.580\n sit down and get right into it,\n\n1:22:38.580 --> 1:22:40.860\n do you know the night before\n\n1:22:40.860 --> 1:22:43.540\n of what that starting point is?\n\n1:22:43.540 --> 1:22:46.220\n I always try to stop.\n\n1:22:46.220 --> 1:22:47.060\n And I learned this,\n\n1:22:47.060 --> 1:22:48.260\n I think Hemingway wrote about this\n\n1:22:48.260 --> 1:22:49.940\n or John Steinbeck or one of the,\n\n1:22:49.940 --> 1:22:51.180\n or maybe both of them,\n\n1:22:51.180 --> 1:22:54.780\n to always stop when you kind of know what's coming next.\n\n1:22:54.780 --> 1:22:58.220\n So you're not at a facing a chasm, you know?\n\n1:22:58.220 --> 1:22:59.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:59.460 --> 1:23:02.260\n Okay, so and afterwards when you're done,\n\n1:23:02.260 --> 1:23:03.340\n the office is closed.\n\n1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:04.180\n The office is closed,\n\n1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:05.700\n I let the muse take care of it, you know?\n\n1:23:05.700 --> 1:23:07.380\n And I don't want to,\n\n1:23:07.380 --> 1:23:09.740\n and I think it's a very unhealthy thing\n\n1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:13.380\n to worry about it or think about any creative process.\n\n1:23:14.420 --> 1:23:18.700\n You don't, like on a long walk later, think about?\n\n1:23:18.700 --> 1:23:22.220\n Yeah, then I will sort of keep my mind open to it,\n\n1:23:22.220 --> 1:23:24.340\n but I won't be like obsessing about it.\n\n1:23:24.340 --> 1:23:25.180\n Okay.\n\n1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:26.660\n Because actually on walks,\n\n1:23:26.660 --> 1:23:28.380\n sometimes things will pop in your head, you know,\n\n1:23:28.380 --> 1:23:30.420\n and you'll go, oh, I should change that.\n\n1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:33.560\n But that's not your ego doing it,\n\n1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:35.280\n that's the deeper level.\n\n1:23:36.300 --> 1:23:38.620\n Okay, so how does the day end?\n\n1:23:38.620 --> 1:23:39.820\n So go. In terms of writing?\n\n1:23:39.820 --> 1:23:41.540\n So yeah, the writing, well no,\n\n1:23:41.540 --> 1:23:45.220\n the writing, the office door closes\n\n1:23:45.220 --> 1:23:48.520\n and then the rest of the day just do whatever the hell.\n\n1:23:49.740 --> 1:23:51.020\n Maybe go out to dinner,\n\n1:23:51.020 --> 1:23:52.420\n my girlfriend is not here now,\n\n1:23:52.420 --> 1:23:53.540\n she's in New York working,\n\n1:23:53.540 --> 1:23:56.100\n we'll make dinner or whatever.\n\n1:23:56.100 --> 1:23:57.380\n Go out to dinner, something like that,\n\n1:23:57.380 --> 1:24:01.260\n and maybe I'll read something, nothing heavy.\n\n1:24:02.940 --> 1:24:04.660\n And I go to bed pretty early,\n\n1:24:04.660 --> 1:24:08.260\n and the gym is a big thing for me.\n\n1:24:08.260 --> 1:24:10.660\n I'll already, sort of probably like with you\n\n1:24:10.660 --> 1:24:12.020\n with martial arts, the night before,\n\n1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:15.460\n I'll be visualizing what I have to do the next day\n\n1:24:16.340 --> 1:24:20.020\n and getting myself psyched up for that.\n\n1:24:20.020 --> 1:24:22.140\n And then I'll just conk out like a light\n\n1:24:22.140 --> 1:24:24.340\n and wake up at the crack of dawn.\n\n1:24:24.340 --> 1:24:28.140\n Okay, so looking out into the future,\n\n1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:30.940\n this year, next few years,\n\n1:24:30.940 --> 1:24:33.340\n what do you think the muse has in store for you?\n\n1:24:34.900 --> 1:24:36.500\n I don't think you can ever know.\n\n1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:40.060\n It's probably something along the same,\n\n1:24:40.060 --> 1:24:43.740\n I really believe there's that exercise\n\n1:24:43.740 --> 1:24:45.780\n where they say to you,\n\n1:24:45.780 --> 1:24:48.180\n visualize yourself five years in the future\n\n1:24:48.180 --> 1:24:50.820\n and write a letter from that person to yourself.\n\n1:24:50.820 --> 1:24:52.300\n I don't believe in that at all\n\n1:24:52.300 --> 1:24:54.460\n because I don't think you can,\n\n1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:57.220\n there's a line out of Africa\n\n1:24:57.220 --> 1:24:59.340\n that God made the world round\n\n1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:01.900\n so that we couldn't see too far ahead.\n\n1:25:03.660 --> 1:25:07.800\n You just don't know as a writer or as a person,\n\n1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:12.860\n I never knew, my first book was A Legend of Bag of Ants.\n\n1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:14.740\n I hadn't, before that happened,\n\n1:25:14.740 --> 1:25:17.900\n I had no clue that I was gonna be writing anything like that\n\n1:25:17.900 --> 1:25:20.900\n on that subject, anything at all, no clue,\n\n1:25:20.900 --> 1:25:22.260\n until it just sort of came.\n\n1:25:22.260 --> 1:25:24.460\n And then when that was done,\n\n1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:25.780\n people said, well, you gotta write another one.\n\n1:25:25.780 --> 1:25:27.200\n I had no idea what it was,\n\n1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:30.160\n which was gonna be Gates of Fire, no clue.\n\n1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:34.660\n So if somebody had sat me down at the start of that\n\n1:25:34.660 --> 1:25:36.020\n and asked the question,\n\n1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:39.660\n I would have been crazy to have said it.\n\n1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:44.080\n So I just hope as the future unfolds,\n\n1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:45.940\n that I'm open to it.\n\n1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:51.300\n Well, I think I speak for a lot of people\n\n1:25:51.300 --> 1:25:54.780\n in saying that we look forward to what that future looks like.\n\n1:25:54.780 --> 1:25:57.380\n Stephen, thank you so much for talking today, it was fun.\n\n1:25:57.380 --> 1:25:59.200\n You got the best job in the world going around\n\n1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:01.940\n talking to people that you wanna talk to\n\n1:26:01.940 --> 1:26:04.220\n and that they will talk to you.\n\n1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:05.300\n So thank you for doing it.\n\n1:26:05.300 --> 1:26:07.460\n Hey, thank you for the great questions you made me think.\n\n1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:08.820\n I've certainly a bunch of questions\n\n1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:10.980\n I've never ever answered before.\n\n1:26:10.980 --> 1:26:11.820\n Awesome, thank you so much.\n\n1:26:11.820 --> 1:26:12.780\n So thanks a lot, great.\n\n1:26:12.780 --> 1:26:14.180\n Thank you.\n\n1:26:14.180 --> 1:26:15.700\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:26:15.700 --> 1:26:17.020\n with

1:26:59.660\n That's a good sign.\n\n1:26:59.660 --> 1:27:00.900\n Fear is good.\n\n1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:03.980\n Like self doubt, fear is an indicator.\n\n1:27:03.980 --> 1:27:06.900\n Fear tells us what we have to do.\n\n1:27:06.900 --> 1:27:08.860\n Remember one rule of thumb,\n\n1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:12.300\n the more scared we are of a work or a calling,\n\n1:27:12.300 --> 1:27:15.340\n the more sure we can be that we have to do it.\n\n1:27:15.340 --> 1:27:19.900\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
