company that through its long history\n\n00:08.720 --> 00:11.560\n has created some of the most incredible engineering marvels\n\n00:11.560 --> 00:13.940\n human beings have ever built,\n\n00:13.940 --> 00:17.020\n including planes that fly fast and undetected,\n\n00:17.020 --> 00:19.820\n defense systems that intersect nuclear threats\n\n00:19.820 --> 00:22.440\n that can take the lives of millions,\n\n00:22.440 --> 00:25.240\n and systems that venture out into space,\n\n00:25.240 --> 00:28.320\n the moon, Mars, and beyond.\n\n00:28.320 --> 00:31.740\n And these days, more and more artificial intelligence\n\n00:31.740 --> 00:34.780\n has an assistive role to play in these systems.\n\n00:34.780 --> 00:38.280\n I've read several books in preparation for this conversation.\n\n00:38.280 --> 00:40.040\n It is a difficult one,\n\n00:40.040 --> 00:43.420\n because in part Lockheed Martin builds military systems\n\n00:43.420 --> 00:45.220\n that operate in a complicated world\n\n00:45.220 --> 00:48.080\n that often does not have easy solutions\n\n00:48.080 --> 00:51.460\n in the gray area between good and evil.\n\n00:52.420 --> 00:56.380\n I hope one day this world will rid itself of war\n\n00:56.380 --> 00:58.540\n in all its forms.\n\n00:58.540 --> 01:00.300\n But the path to achieving that in a world\n\n01:00.300 --> 01:02.880\n that does have evil is not obvious.\n\n01:02.880 --> 01:05.060\n What is obvious is good engineering\n\n01:05.060 --> 01:07.100\n and artificial intelligence research\n\n01:07.100 --> 01:11.180\n has a role to play on the side of good.\n\n01:11.180 --> 01:13.980\n Lockheed Martin and the rest of our community\n\n01:13.980 --> 01:17.020\n are hard at work at exactly this task.\n\n01:17.020 --> 01:19.660\n We talk about these and other important topics\n\n01:19.660 --> 01:21.320\n in this conversation.\n\n01:21.320 --> 01:24.820\n Also, most certainly, both Keoki and I\n\n01:24.820 --> 01:27.060\n have a passion for space,\n\n01:27.060 --> 01:31.360\n us humans venturing out toward the stars.\n\n01:32.280 --> 01:34.540\n We talk about this exciting future as well.\n\n01:35.400 --> 01:38.040\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:38.040 --> 01:40.500\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:40.500 --> 01:43.880\n give it five stars on iTunes, support it on Patreon,\n\n01:43.880

Jackson.\n\n01:55.540 --> 01:57.900\n I read several books on Lockheed Martin recently.\n\n01:57.900 --> 02:00.540\n My favorite in particular is by Ben Rich,\n\n02:00.540 --> 02:03.380\n Carlos Concord's personal memoir.\n\n02:03.380 --> 02:05.080\n It gets a little edgy at times.\n\n02:05.080 --> 02:09.560\n But from that, I was reminded that the engineers\n\n02:09.560 --> 02:11.980\n at Lockheed Martin have created some of the most\n\n02:11.980 --> 02:15.140\n incredible engineering marvels human beings have ever built\n\n02:15.140 --> 02:18.680\n throughout the 20th century and the 21st.\n\n02:18.680 --> 02:22.660\n Do you remember a particular project or system at Lockheed\n\n02:22.660 --> 02:25.460\n or before that at the Space Shuttle Columbia\n\n02:25.460 --> 02:29.460\n that you were just in awe at the fact that us humans\n\n02:29.460 --> 02:31.100\n could create something like this?\n\n02:32.420 --> 02:34.180\n You know, that's a great question.\n\n02:34.180 --> 02:37.420\n There's a lot of things that I could draw on there.\n\n02:37.420 --> 02:39.820\n When you look at the Skunk Works and Ben Rich's book\n\n02:39.820 --> 02:42.520\n in particular, of course, it starts off with basically\n\n02:42.520 --> 02:44.880\n the start of the jet age and the P 80.\n\n02:44.880 --> 02:49.020\n And I had the opportunity to sit next to one\n\n02:49.020 --> 02:53.060\n of the Apollo astronauts, Charlie Duke, recently at dinner.\n\n02:53.060 --> 02:56.060\n And I said, hey, what's your favorite aircraft?\n\n02:56.060 --> 02:59.300\n And he said, well, it was by far the F 104 Starfighter,\n\n02:59.300 --> 03:02.740\n which was another aircraft that came out of Lockheed there.\n\n03:02.740 --> 03:07.740\n It was the first Mach 2 jet fighter aircraft.\n\n03:08.220 --> 03:11.220\n They called it the missile with a man in it.\n\n03:11.220 --> 03:13.220\n And so those are the kinds of things I grew up hearing\n\n03:13.220 --> 03:15.340\n stories about.\n\n03:15.340 --> 03:19.140\n You know, of course, the SR 71 is incomparable\n\n03:19.140 --> 03:24.140\n as kind of the epitome of speed, altitude,\n\n03:24.700 --> 03:26.820\n and just the coolest looking aircraft ever.\n\n03:26.820 --> 03:29.100\n So there's a reconnaissance, that's a plane.\n\n03:29.100 --> 03:30.940\n That's a, yeah, intelligence surveillance\n\n03:30.940 --> 03:33.380\n and reconnaissance aircraft that was designed\n\n03:33.380 --> 03:36.180\n to be able to outrun, basically go faster\n\n03:36.180 --> 03:38.640\n than any air defense system.\n\n03:38.640 --> 03:42.940\n But, you know, I'll tell you, I'm a space junkie.\n\n03:42.940 --> 03:44.860\n That's why I came to MIT.\n\n03:44.860 --> 03:49.100\n That's really what took me ultimately to Lockheed Martin.\n\n03:49.100 --> 03:51.380\n And I grew up, and so Lockheed Martin, for example,\n\n03:51.380 --> 03:56.340\n has been essentially at the heart of every planetary mission,\n\n03:56.340 --> 03:59.580\n like all the Mars missions we've had a part in.\n\n03:59.580 --> 04:02.100\n And we've talked a lot about the 50th anniversary\n\n04:02.100 --> 04:04.980\n of Apollo here in the last couple of weeks, right?\n\n04:04.980 --> 04:09.980\n But remember, 1976, July 20th, again, National Space Days,\n\n04:09.980 --> 04:14.980\n the landing of the Viking lander on the surface of Mars,\n\n04:15.260 --> 04:17.020\n just a huge accomplishment.\n\n04:17.020 --> 04:19.980\n And when I was a young engineer at Lockheed Martin,\n\n04:19.980 --> 04:23.140\n I got to meet engineers who had designed, you know,\n\n04:23.140 --> 04:25.860\n various pieces of that mission as well.\n\n04:25.860 --> 04:28.700\n So that's what I grew up on is these planetary missions,\n\n04:28.700 --> 04:30.500\n the start of the space shuttle era,\n\n04:30.500 --> 04:33.740\n and ultimately had the opportunity\n\n04:34.780 --> 04:38.140\n to see Lockheed Martin's part.\n\n04:38.140 --> 04:40.100\n Lockheed Martin's part, and we can maybe talk about\n\n04:40.100 --> 04:42.140\n some of these here, but Lockheed Martin's part\n\n04:42.140 --> 04:44.660\n in all of these space journeys over the years.\n\n04:44.660 --> 04:47.540\n Do you dream, and I apologize for getting philosophical\n\n04:47.540 --> 04:49.900\n at times, or sentimental.\n\n04:49.900 --> 04:53.100\n I do romanticize the notion of space exploration.\n\n04:53.100 --> 04:56.140\n So do you dream of the day when us humans colonize\n\n04:56.140 --> 05:00.020\n another planet like Mars, or a man, a woman,\n\n05:00.020 --> 05:03.140\n a human being steps on Mars?\n\n05:03.140 --> 05:06.580\n Absolutely, and that's a personal dream of mine.\n\n05:06.580 --> 05:09.220\n I haven't given up yet on my own opportunity\n\n05:09.220 --> 05:12.700\n to fly into space, but as, you know,\n\n05:12.700 --> 05:14.420\n from the Lockheed Martin perspective,\n\n05:14.420 --> 05:16.860\n this is something that we're working towards every day.\n\n05:16.860 --> 05:18.740\n And of course, you know, we're building\n\n05:18.740 --> 05:21.860\n the Orion spacecraft, which is the most sophisticated\n\n05:21.860 --> 05:23.860\n human rated spacecraft ever built.\n\n05:23.860 --> 05:26.820\n And it's really designed for these deep space journeys,\n\n05:26.820 --> 05:28.060\n you know, starting with the moon,\n\n05:28.060 --> 05:32.820\n but ultimately going to Mars and being the platform,\n\n05:32.820 --> 05:34.740\n you know, from a design perspective,\n\n05:34.740 --> 05:37.460\n we call the Mars base camp to be able to take humans\n\n05:37.460 --> 05:40.260\n to the surface, and then after a mission\n\n05:40.260 --> 05:42.300\n of a couple of weeks, bring them back up safely.\n\n05:42.300 --> 05:44.580\n And so that is something I want to see happen\n\n05:44.580 --> 05:46.620\n during my time at Lockheed Martin.\n\n05:46.620 --> 05:49.220\n So I'm pretty excited about that.\n\n05:49.220 --> 05:52.780\n And I think, you know, once we prove that's possible,\n\n05:52.780 --> 05:57.180\n you know, colonization might be a little bit further out,\n\n05:57.180 --> 06:00.060\n but it's something that I'd hope to see.\n\n06:00.060 --> 06:03.500\n So maybe you can give a little bit of an overview\n\n06:03.500 --> 06:07.740\n of, so Lockheed Martin has partnered with a few years ago\n\n06:07.740 --> 06:09.820\n with Boeing to work with the DOD and NASA\n\n06:09.820 --> 06:13.580\n to build launch systems and rockets with the ULA.\n\n06:13.580 --> 06:15.500\n What's beyond that?\n\n06:15.500 --> 06:17.420\n What's Lockheed's mission timeline,\n\n06:17.420 --> 06:19.380\n long term dream in terms of space?\n\n06:19.380 --> 06:24.380\n You mentioned the moon, I've heard you talk about asteroids.\n\n06:25.220 --> 06:27.660\n As Mars, what's the timeline?\n\n06:27.660 --> 06:29.300\n What's the engineering challenges\n\n06:29.300 --> 06:31.340\n and what's the dream long term?\n\n06:31.340 --> 06:33.820\n Yeah, I think the dream long term is to have\n\n06:33.820 --> 06:37.860\n a permanent presence in space beyond low earth orbit,\n\n06:37.860 --> 06:41.100\n ultimately with a long term presence on the moon\n\n06:41.100 --> 06:43.740\n and then to the planets, to Mars.\n\n06:43.740 --> 06:45.620\n And... Sorry to interrupt on that.\n\n06:45.620 --> 06:48.020\n So long term presence means...\n\n06:48.020 --> 06:51.100\n Sustained and sustainable presence in an economy,\n\n06:51.100 --> 06:54.420\n a space economy that really goes alongside that.\n\n06:54.420 --> 06:58.300\n With human beings and being able to launch perhaps\n\n06:58.300 --> 07:02.060\n from those, so like hop?\n\n07:02.060 --> 07:04.540\n You know, there's a lot of energy\n\n07:04.540 --> 07:06.060\n that goes in those hops, right?\n\n07:06.060 --> 07:09.740\n So I think the first step is being able to get there\n\n07:09.740 --> 07:12.620\n and to be able to establish sustained bases, right?\n\n07:12.620 --> 07:14.820\n And build from there.\n\n07:14.820 --> 07:18.980\n And a lot of that means getting, as you know,\n\n07:18.980 --> 07:21.500\n things like the cost of launch down\n\n07:21.500 --> 07:23.620\n and you mentioned United Launch Alliance.\n\n07:23.620 --> 07:26.140\n And so I don't wanna speak for ULA,\n\n07:26.140 --> 07:29.020\n but obviously they're working really hard\n\n07:29.020 --> 07:34.020\n to on their next generation of launch vehicles\n\n07:34.940 --> 07:39.260\n to maintain that incredible mission success record\n\n07:39.260 --> 07:41.420\n that ULA has, but ultimately continue\n\n07:41.420 --> 07:43.860\n to drive down the cost and make the flexibility,\n\n07:43.860 --> 07:46.900\n the speed and the access ever greater.\n\n07:46.900 --> 07:50.380\n So what's the missions that are in the horizon\n\n07:50.380 --> 07:51.660\n that you could talk to?\n\n07:51.660 --> 07:53.380\n Is there a hope to get to the moon?\n\n07:53.380 --> 07:54.620\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n07:54.620 --> 07:58.060\n I mean, I think you know this, or you may know this,\n\n07:58.060 --> 08:00.620\n there's a lot of ways to accomplish some of these goals.\n\n08:00.620 --> 08:03.780\n And so that's a lot of what's in discussion today.\n\n08:03.780 --> 08:08.780\n But ultimately the goal is to be able to establish a base\n\n08:09.060 --> 08:12.060\n essentially in cislunar space that would allow\n\n08:12.060 --> 08:17.060\n for ready transfer from orbit to the lunar surface\n\n08:19.020 --> 08:19.900\n and back again.\n\n08:19.900 --> 08:21.900\n And so that's sort of that near term,\n\n08:21.900 --> 08:24.940\n I say near term in the next decade or so vision,\n\n08:26.020 --> 08:29.900\n starting off with a stated objective by this administration\n\n08:29.900 --> 08:34.100\n to get back to the moon in the 2024, 2025 timeframe,\n\n08:34.100 --> 08:37.260\n which is right around the corner here.\n\n08:37.260 --> 08:39.460\n How big of an engineering challenge is that?\n\n08:41.580 --> 08:44.580\n I think the big challenge is not so much to go,\n\n08:44.580 --> 08:46.180\n but to stay, right?\n\n08:46.180 --> 08:48.980\n And so we demonstrated in the 60s\n\n08:48.980 --> 08:50.900\n that you could send somebody up,\n\n08:50.900 --> 08:52.900\n do a couple of days of mission\n\n08:52.900 --> 08:55.580\n and bring them home again successfully.\n\n08:55.580 --> 08:57.260\n Now we're talking about doing that,\n\n08:57.260 --> 08:59.780\n I'd say more to, I don't wanna say an industrial scale,\n\n08:59.780 --> 09:01.380\n but a sustained scale, right?\n\n09:01.380 --> 09:06.380\n So permanent habitation, regular reuse of vehicles,\n\n09:09.460 --> 09:13.780\n the infrastructure to get things like fuel, air,\n\n09:15.220 --> 09:17.100\n consumables, replacement parts,\n\n09:17.100 --> 09:18.980\n all the things that you need to sustain\n\n09:18.980 --> 09:20.740\n that kind of infrastructure.\n\n09:20.740 --> 09:23.620\n So those are certainly engineering challenges,\n\n09:23.620 --> 09:26.100\n there are budgetary challenges,\n\n09:26.100 --> 09:28.980\n and those are all things\n\n09:28.980 --> 09:30.700\n that we're gonna have to work through.\n\n09:30.700 --> 09:32.900\n The other thing, and I shouldn't,\n\n09:33.860 --> 09:35.060\n I don't wanna minimize this,\n\n09:35.060 --> 09:38.220\n I mean, I'm excited about human exploration,\n\n09:38.220 --> 09:40.820\n but the reality is our technology\n\n09:40.820 --> 09:44.980\n and where we've come over the last 40 years essentially\n\n09:44.980 --> 09:48.860\n has changed what we can do with robotic exploration as well.\n\n09:48.860 --> 09:52.020\n And to me, it's incredibly thrilling,\n\n09:52.020 --> 09:53.740\n and this seems like old news now,\n\n09:53.740 --> 09:57.340\n but the fact that we have rovers driving around\n\n09:57.340 --> 10:00.300\n the surface of Mars and sending back data\n\n10:00.300 --> 10:01.340\n is just incredible.\n\n10:01.340 --> 10:04.260\n The fact that we have satellites in orbit around Mars\n\n10:04.260 --> 10:06.420\n that are collecting weather,\n\n10:06.420 --> 10:08.340\n they're looking at the terrain, they're mapping,\n\n10:08.340 --> 10:11.340\n all of these kinds of things on a continuous basis,\n\n10:11.340 --> 10:12.740\n that's incredible.\n\n10:12.740 --> 10:15.900\n And the fact that you got the time lag, of course,\n\n10:15.900 --> 10:17.940\n going to the planets,\n\n10:17.940 --> 10:22.020\n but you can effectively have virtual human presence there\n\n10:22.940 --> 10:25.860\n in a way that we have never been able to do before.\n\n10:25.860 --> 10:30.060\n And now with the advent of even greater processing power,\n\n10:30.060 --> 10:33.580\n better AI systems, better cognitive systems\n\n10:33.580 --> 10:35.740\n and decision systems,\n\n10:35.740 --> 10:38.780\n you put that together with the human piece\n\n10:38.780 --> 10:41.500\n and we've really opened up the solar system\n\n10:41.500 --> 10:42.540\n in a whole different way.\n\n10:42.540 --> 10:44.900\n And I'll give you an example, we've got OSIRIS REx,\n\n10:44.900 --> 10:47.780\n which is a mission to the asteroid Bennu.\n\n10:47.780 --> 10:50.900\n So the spacecraft is out there right now\n\n10:50.900 --> 10:54.260\n on basically a year mapping activity\n\n10:54.260 --> 10:59.180\n to map the entire surface of that asteroid in great detail.\n\n10:59.180 --> 11:02.540\n You know, all autonomously piloted, right?\n\n11:02.540 --> 11:04.820\n But the idea then that, and this is not too far away,\n\n11:04.820 --> 11:05.980\n it's gonna go in,\n\n11:05.980 --> 11:09.620\n it's got a sort of fancy vacuum cleaner with a bucket,\n\n11:09.620 --> 11:12.540\n it's gonna collect the sample off the asteroid\n\n11:12.540 --> 11:14.420\n and then send it back here to Earth.\n\n11:14.420 --> 11:18.140\n And so, you know, we have gone from sort of those\n\n11:18.140 --> 11:21.260\n tentative steps in the 70s, you know,\n\n11:21.260 --> 11:23.940\n early landings, video of the solar system\n\n11:23.940 --> 11:27.060\n to now we've sent spacecraft to Pluto,\n\n11:27.060 --> 11:31.620\n we have gone to comets and brought and intercepted comets,\n\n11:31.620 --> 11:36.620\n we've brought stardust, you know, material back.\n\n11:37.260 --> 11:40.700\n So that's, we've gone far\n\n11:40.700 --> 11:43.700\n and there's incredible opportunity to go even farther.\n\n11:43.700 --> 11:47.420\n So it seems quite crazy that this is even possible,\n\n11:47.420 --> 11:50.340\n that can you talk a little bit about\n\n11:51.340 --> 11:54.060\n what it means to orbit an asteroid\n\n11:54.060 --> 11:58.380\n and with a bucket to try to pick up some soil samples?\n\n11:58.380 --> 12:02.460\n Yeah, so part of it is just kind of the, you know,\n\n12:02.460 --> 12:05.940\n these are the same kinds of techniques we use here on Earth\n\n12:05.940 --> 12:10.940\n for high speed, high accuracy imagery,\n\n12:10.940 --> 12:14.300\n stitching these scenes together and creating\n\n12:14.300 --> 12:17.460\n essentially high accuracy world maps, right?\n\n12:17.460 --> 12:20.300\n And so that's what we're doing, obviously,\n\n12:20.300 --> 12:23.180\n on a much smaller scale with an asteroid.\n\n12:23.180 --> 12:24.940\n But the other thing that's really interesting,\n\n12:24.940 --> 12:28.500\n you put together sort of that neat control\n\n12:28.500 --> 12:32.540\n and, you know, data and imagery problem.\n\n12:33.660 --> 12:36.980\n But the stories around how we designed the collection,\n\n12:36.980 --> 12:38.420\n I mean, as essentially, you know,\n\n12:38.420 --> 12:41.380\n this is the sort of the human ingenuity element, right?\n\n12:41.380 --> 12:45.780\n That, you know, essentially had an engineer who had a,\n\n12:45.780 --> 12:49.220\n one day he's like, oh, starts messing around with parts,\n\n12:49.220 --> 12:51.860\n vacuum cleaner, bucket, you know,\n\n12:51.860 --> 12:53.460\n maybe we could do something like this.\n\n12:53.460 --> 12:55.140\n And that was what led to what we call\n\n12:55.140 --> 12:57.020\n the pogo stick collection, right?\n\n12:57.020 --> 12:59.220\n Where basically a thing comes down,\n\n12:59.220 --> 13:02.860\n it's only there for seconds, does that collection,\n\n13:02.860 --> 13:07.500\n grabs the, essentially blows the regolith material\n\n13:07.500 --> 13:10.180\n into the collection hopper and off it goes.\n\n13:10.180 --> 13:12.060\n It doesn't really land almost.\n\n13:12.060 --> 13:13.540\n It's a very short landing.\n\n13:13.540 --> 13:15.460\n Wow, that's incredible.\n\n13:15.460 --> 13:20.460\n So what is, in those, we talked a little bit more\n\n13:20.500 --> 13:24.380\n about space, what's the role of the human in all of this?\n\n13:24.380 --> 13:25.820\n What are the challenges?\n\n13:25.820 --> 13:29.060\n What are the opportunities for humans\n\n13:29.060 --> 13:33.780\n as they pilot these vehicles in space?\n\n13:33.780 --> 13:37.540\n And for humans that may step foot\n\n13:37.540 --> 13:41.260\n on either the moon or Mars?\n\n13:41.260 --> 13:43.500\n Yeah, it's a great question because, you know,\n\n13:43.500 --> 13:47.380\n I just have been extolling the virtues of robotic\n\n13:47.380 --> 13:50.820\n and, you know, rovers, autonomous systems,\n\n13:50.820 --> 13:53.740\n and those absolutely have a role.\n\n13:53.740 --> 13:57.260\n I think the thing that we don't know how to replace today\n\n13:57.260 --> 14:02.260\n is the ability to adapt on the fly to new information.\n\n14:02.260 --> 14:07.260\n And I believe that will come, but we're not there yet.\n\n14:07.620 --> 14:08.820\n There's a ways to go.\n\n14:08.820 --> 14:13.620\n And so, you know, you think back to Apollo 13\n\n14:13.620 --> 14:15.980\n and the ingenuity of the folks on the ground\n\n14:15.980 --> 14:19.140\n and on the spacecraft essentially cobbled together\n\n14:19.140 --> 14:22.780\n a way to get the carbon dioxide scrubbers to work.\n\n14:23.820 --> 14:28.380\n Those are the kinds of things that ultimately, you know,\n\n14:28.380 --> 14:31.340\n and I'd say not just from dealing with anomalies,\n\n14:31.340 --> 14:33.660\n but, you know, dealing with new information.\n\n14:33.660 --> 14:37.740\n You see something and rather than waiting\n\n14:37.740 --> 14:39.660\n 20 minutes or half an hour, an hour\n\n14:39.660 --> 14:42.100\n to try to get information back and forth,\n\n14:42.100 --> 14:45.340\n but be able to essentially revector on the fly,\n\n14:45.340 --> 14:47.660\n collect, you know, different samples,\n\n14:47.660 --> 14:49.140\n take a different approach,\n\n14:49.140 --> 14:52.740\n choose different areas to explore.\n\n14:52.740 --> 14:56.780\n Those are the kinds of things that human presence enables\n\n14:56.780 --> 15:00.300\n that is still a ways ahead of us on the AI side.\n\n15:00.300 --> 15:01.500\n Yeah, there's some interesting stuff\n\n15:01.500 --> 15:04.580\n we'll talk about on the teaming side here on Earth.\n\n15:04.580 --> 15:06.420\n That's pretty cool to explore.\n\n15:06.420 --> 15:08.820\n And in space, let's not leave the space piece out.\n\n15:08.820 --> 15:11.700\n So what does teaming, what does AI and humans\n\n15:11.700 --> 15:13.900\n working together in space look like?\n\n15:13.900 --> 15:15.420\n Yeah, one of the things we're working on\n\n15:15.420 --> 15:18.060\n is a system called Maya, which is,\n\n15:18.060 --> 15:21.340\n you think of it, so it's an AI assistant.\n\n15:21.340 --> 15:24.180\n In space. In space, exactly.\n\n15:24.180 --> 15:28.540\n And you think of it as the Alexa in space, right?\n\n15:28.540 --> 15:31.700\n But this goes hand in hand with a lot of other developments.\n\n15:31.700 --> 15:35.140\n And so today's world, everything is essentially model based,\n\n15:35.140 --> 15:38.020\n model based systems engineering\n\n15:38.020 --> 15:42.540\n to the actual digital tapestry that goes through the design,\n\n15:42.540 --> 15:44.780\n the build, the manufacture, the testing,\n\n15:44.780 --> 15:47.620\n and ultimately the sustainment of these system.\n\n15:47.620 --> 15:50.980\n And so our vision is really that, you know,\n\n15:50.980 --> 15:54.780\n when our astronauts are there around Mars,\n\n15:54.780 --> 15:59.420\n you're gonna have that entire digital library\n\n15:59.420 --> 16:04.420\n of the spacecraft, of its operations, all the test data,\n\n16:04.420 --> 16:08.060\n all the test data and flight data from previous missions\n\n16:08.060 --> 16:11.780\n to be able to look and see if there are anomalous conditions\n\n16:11.780 --> 16:16.020\n and tell the humans and potentially deal with that\n\n16:16.020 --> 16:20.100\n before it becomes a bad situation\n\n16:20.100 --> 16:23.180\n and help the astronauts work through those kinds of things.\n\n16:23.180 --> 16:25.260\n And it's not just, you know,\n\n16:25.260 --> 16:26.860\n dealing with problems as they come up,\n\n16:26.860 --> 16:29.220\n but also offering up opportunities\n\n16:29.220 --> 16:32.540\n for additional exploration capability, for example.\n\n16:32.540 --> 16:34.980\n So that's the vision is that, you know,\n\n16:34.980 --> 16:37.140\n these are gonna take the best of the human\n\n16:37.140 --> 16:41.060\n to respond to changing circumstances\n\n16:41.060 --> 16:44.620\n and rely on the best of AI capabilities\n\n16:44.620 --> 16:46.180\n to monitor these, you know,\n\n16:46.180 --> 16:49.540\n this almost infinite number of data points\n\n16:49.540 --> 16:51.620\n and correlations of data points\n\n16:51.620 --> 16:54.020\n that humans frankly aren't that good at.\n\n16:54.020 --> 16:56.260\n So how do you develop systems in space like this,\n\n16:56.260 --> 17:01.260\n whether it's Alexa in space or in general,\n\n17:01.260 --> 17:03.580\n any kind of control systems,\n\n17:03.580 --> 17:04.940\n any kind of intelligent systems\n\n17:04.940 --> 17:08.700\n when you can't really test stuff too much out in space?\n\n17:08.700 --> 17:10.860\n It's very expensive to test stuff.\n\n17:10.860 --> 17:14.260\n So how do you develop such systems?\n\n17:14.260 --> 17:19.020\n Yeah, that's the beauty of this digital twin, if you will.\n\n17:19.020 --> 17:21.140\n And of course, with Lockheed Martin,\n\n17:21.140 --> 17:24.580\n we've over the past, you know, five plus decades\n\n17:24.580 --> 17:28.180\n been refining our knowledge of the space environment,\n\n17:28.180 --> 17:32.180\n of how materials behave, dynamics,\n\n17:32.180 --> 17:35.940\n the controls, the radiation environments,\n\n17:35.940 --> 17:37.260\n all of these kinds of things.\n\n17:37.260 --> 17:39.940\n So we're able to create very sophisticated models.\n\n17:39.940 --> 17:43.500\n They're not perfect, but they're very good.\n\n17:43.500 --> 17:46.660\n And so you can actually do a lot.\n\n17:46.660 --> 17:49.060\n I spent part of my career, you know,\n\n17:49.060 --> 17:53.100\n simulating communication spacecraft,\n\n17:53.100 --> 17:56.460\n you know, missile warning spacecraft, GPS spacecraft\n\n17:56.460 --> 17:59.340\n in all kinds of scenarios and all kinds of environments.\n\n17:59.340 --> 18:01.940\n So this is really just taking that to the next level.\n\n18:01.940 --> 18:03.860\n The interesting thing is that now\n\n18:03.860 --> 18:06.420\n you're bringing into that loop\n\n18:06.420 --> 18:08.380\n a system depending on how it's developed\n\n18:08.380 --> 18:10.620\n that may be non deterministic,\n\n18:10.620 --> 18:13.260\n it may be learning as it goes.\n\n18:13.260 --> 18:14.500\n And in fact, we anticipate\n\n18:14.500 --> 18:16.620\n that it will be learning as it goes.\n\n18:16.620 --> 18:21.620\n And so that brings a whole new level of interest,\n\n18:21.820 --> 18:25.420\n I guess, into how do you do verification and validation\n\n18:25.420 --> 18:28.580\n of these non deterministic learning systems\n\n18:28.580 --> 18:31.780\n in scenarios that may go out of the bounds\n\n18:31.780 --> 18:35.100\n or the envelope that you have initially designed them to.\n\n18:35.100 --> 18:37.460\n So had this system and its intelligence\n\n18:37.460 --> 18:39.220\n has the same complexity,\n\n18:39.220 --> 18:41.060\n some of the same complexity human does\n\n18:41.060 --> 18:43.660\n and learns over time, it's unpredictable\n\n18:43.660 --> 18:46.260\n in certain kinds of ways in the,\n\n18:46.260 --> 18:49.100\n so you still, you also have to model that\n\n18:49.100 --> 18:50.100\n when you're thinking about it.\n\n18:50.100 --> 18:53.460\n So in your thoughts, it's possible\n\n18:53.460 --> 18:57.260\n to model the majority of situations,\n\n18:57.260 --> 18:59.660\n the important aspects of situations here on earth\n\n18:59.660 --> 19:02.320\n and in space enough to test stuff?\n\n19:02.320 --> 19:05.620\n Yeah, this is really an active area of research\n\n19:05.620 --> 19:07.480\n and we're actually funding university research\n\n19:07.480 --> 19:10.140\n in a variety of places, including MIT.\n\n19:10.140 --> 19:13.780\n This is in the realm of trust and verification\n\n19:13.780 --> 19:18.020\n and validation of I'd say autonomous systems in general\n\n19:18.020 --> 19:21.020\n and then as a subset of that autonomous systems\n\n19:21.020 --> 19:24.620\n that incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\n19:24.620 --> 19:27.980\n And this is not an easy problem.\n\n19:27.980 --> 19:29.600\n We're working with startup companies,\n\n19:29.600 --> 19:33.700\n we've got internal R&D, but our conviction is\n\n19:33.700 --> 19:38.700\n that autonomy and more and more AI enabled autonomy\n\n19:39.260 --> 19:42.780\n is gonna be in everything that Lockheed Martin develops\n\n19:42.780 --> 19:46.700\n and fields and it's gonna be retrofitting it.\n\n19:46.700 --> 19:48.940\n Autonomy and AI are gonna be retrofit\n\n19:48.940 --> 19:50.900\n into existing systems, they're gonna be part\n\n19:50.900 --> 19:54.540\n of the design for all of our future systems.\n\n19:54.540 --> 19:56.580\n And so maybe I should take a step back\n\n19:56.580 --> 19:58.680\n and say the way we define autonomy.\n\n19:58.680 --> 20:02.180\n So we talk about autonomy essentially a system\n\n20:02.180 --> 20:07.180\n that composes, selects and then executes decisions\n\n20:08.460 --> 20:12.500\n with varying levels of human intervention.\n\n20:12.500 --> 20:15.660\n And so you could think of no autonomy.\n\n20:15.660 --> 20:18.460\n So this is essentially the human doing the task.\n\n20:18.460 --> 20:23.080\n You can think of effectively partial autonomy\n\n20:23.080 --> 20:25.820\n where the human is in the loop.\n\n20:25.820 --> 20:29.140\n So making decisions in every case\n\n20:29.140 --> 20:31.140\n about what the autonomous system can do.\n\n20:31.140 --> 20:33.220\n Either in the cockpit or remotely.\n\n20:33.220 --> 20:36.060\n Or remotely, exactly, but still in that control loop.\n\n20:36.060 --> 20:39.860\n And then there's what you'd call supervisory autonomy.\n\n20:39.860 --> 20:42.420\n So the autonomous system is doing most of the work,\n\n20:42.420 --> 20:44.380\n the human can intervene to stop it\n\n20:44.380 --> 20:45.820\n or to change the direction.\n\n20:45.820 --> 20:47.940\n And then ultimately full autonomy\n\n20:47.940 --> 20:50.300\n where the human is off the loop altogether.\n\n20:50.300 --> 20:52.860\n And for different types of missions\n\n20:52.860 --> 20:55.820\n wanna have different levels of autonomy.\n\n20:55.820 --> 20:58.380\n So now take that spectrum and this conviction\n\n20:58.380 --> 21:01.220\n that autonomy and more and more AI\n\n21:01.220 --> 21:03.500\n are in everything that we develop.\n\n21:05.100 --> 21:07.980\n The kinds of things that Lockheed Martin does,\n\n21:07.980 --> 21:12.380\n a lot of times are safety of life critical kinds of missions.\n\n21:12.380 --> 21:14.620\n You think about aircraft, for example.\n\n21:15.980 --> 21:20.100\n And so we require and our customers require\n\n21:20.100 --> 21:23.260\n an extremely high level of confidence.\n\n21:23.260 --> 21:26.420\n One, that we're gonna protect life.\n\n21:26.420 --> 21:30.680\n Two, that these systems will behave\n\n21:30.680 --> 21:33.900\n in ways that their operators can understand.\n\n21:33.900 --> 21:36.420\n And so this gets into that whole field.\n\n21:36.420 --> 21:40.340\n Again, being able to verify and validate\n\n21:40.340 --> 21:44.980\n that the systems have been and that they will operate\n\n21:44.980 --> 21:48.100\n the way they're designed and the way they're expected.\n\n21:48.100 --> 21:50.740\n And furthermore, that they will do that\n\n21:50.740 --> 21:55.460\n in ways that can be explained and understood.\n\n21:55.460 --> 21:58.860\n And that is an extremely difficult challenge.\n\n21:58.860 --> 22:00.840\n Yeah, so here's a difficult question.\n\n22:00.840 --> 22:04.420\n I don't mean to bring this up,\n\n22:04.420 --> 22:05.640\n but I think it's a good case study\n\n22:05.640 --> 22:10.060\n that people are familiar with the Boeing 737 Max\n\n22:10.060 --> 22:13.420\n commercial airplane has had two recent crashes\n\n22:13.420 --> 22:15.980\n where their flight control software system failed\n\n22:15.980 --> 22:17.540\n and it's software.\n\n22:17.540 --> 22:19.060\n So I don't mean to speak about Boeing,\n\n22:19.060 --> 22:21.020\n but broadly speaking, we have this\n\n22:21.020 --> 22:24.060\n in the autonomous vehicle space too, semi autonomous.\n\n22:24.060 --> 22:29.060\n We have millions of lines of code software making decisions.\n\n22:30.420 --> 22:32.900\n There is a little bit of a clash of cultures\n\n22:32.900 --> 22:37.060\n because software engineers don't have the same culture\n\n22:37.060 --> 22:41.860\n of safety often that people who build systems\n\n22:41.860 --> 22:45.540\n like at Lockheed Martin do where it has to be\n\n22:45.540 --> 22:48.100\n exceptionally safe, you have to test this on.\n\n22:48.100 --> 22:50.580\n So how do we get this right when software\n\n22:50.580 --> 22:53.180\n is making so many decisions?\n\n22:53.180 --> 22:57.140\n Yeah, and there's a lot of things that have to happen.\n\n22:57.140 --> 23:01.260\n And by and large, I think it starts with the culture,\n\n23:01.260 --> 23:04.500\n which is not necessarily something that A,\n\n23:04.500 --> 23:07.980\n is taught in school or B is something that would come,\n\n23:07.980 --> 23:10.820\n depending on what kind of software you're developing,\n\n23:10.820 --> 23:13.100\n it may not be relevant, right?\n\n23:13.100 --> 23:15.740\n If you're targeting ads or something like that.\n\n23:15.740 --> 23:20.600\n So, and by and large, I'd say not just Lockheed Martin,\n\n23:20.600 --> 23:23.700\n but certainly the aerospace industry as a whole\n\n23:23.700 --> 23:27.240\n has developed a culture that does focus on safety,\n\n23:27.240 --> 23:31.000\n safety of life, operational safety, mission success.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:34.080\n But as you note, these systems\n\n23:34.080 --> 23:36.160\n have gotten incredibly complex.\n\n23:36.160 --> 23:40.520\n And so they're to the point where it's almost impossible,\n\n23:40.520 --> 23:42.600\n you know, state spaces become so huge\n\n23:42.600 --> 23:45.920\n that it's impossible to, or very difficult\n\n23:45.920 --> 23:50.880\n to do a systematic verification across the entire set\n\n23:50.880 --> 23:53.760\n of potential ways that an aircraft could be flown,\n\n23:53.760 --> 23:55.600\n all the conditions that could happen,\n\n23:55.600 --> 23:59.340\n all the potential failure scenarios.\n\n23:59.340 --> 24:01.140\n Now, maybe that's soluble one day,\n\n24:01.140 --> 24:03.400\n maybe when we have our quantum computers\n\n24:03.400 --> 24:06.920\n at our fingertips, we'll be able to actually\n\n24:06.920 --> 24:09.280\n simulate across an entire, you know,\n\n24:09.280 --> 24:11.300\n almost infinite state space.\n\n24:11.300 --> 24:16.300\n But today, you know, there's a lot of work\n\n24:16.320 --> 24:20.980\n to really try to bound the system,\n\n24:20.980 --> 24:24.800\n to make sure that it behaves in predictable ways,\n\n24:24.800 --> 24:29.100\n and then have this culture of continuous inquiry\n\n24:29.100 --> 24:33.200\n and skepticism and questioning to say,\n\n24:33.200 --> 24:37.320\n did we really consider the right realm of possibilities?\n\n24:37.320 --> 24:40.160\n Have we done the right range of testing?\n\n24:40.160 --> 24:42.160\n Do we really understand, you know, in this case,\n\n24:42.160 --> 24:44.640\n you know, human and machine interactions,\n\n24:44.640 --> 24:49.480\n the human decision process alongside the machine processes?\n\n24:49.480 --> 24:51.640\n And so that's that culture,\n\n24:51.640 --> 24:54.960\n we call it the culture of mission success at Lockheed Martin\n\n24:54.960 --> 24:56.720\n that really needs to be established.\n\n24:56.720 --> 24:57.960\n And it's not something, you know,\n\n24:57.960 --> 25:02.160\n it's something that people learn by living in it.\n\n25:02.160 --> 25:05.200\n And it's something that has to be promulgated, you know,\n\n25:05.200 --> 25:07.600\n and it's done, you know, from the highest levels\n\n25:07.600 --> 25:10.200\n at a company of Lockheed Martin, like Lockheed Martin.\n\n25:10.200 --> 25:12.520\n Yeah, and the same is being faced\n\n25:12.520 --> 25:14.040\n at certain autonomous vehicle companies\n\n25:14.040 --> 25:15.820\n where that culture is not there\n\n25:15.820 --> 25:18.640\n because it started mostly by software engineers.\n\n25:18.640 --> 25:20.520\n So that's what they're struggling with.\n\n25:21.480 --> 25:25.720\n Is there lessons that you think we should learn\n\n25:25.720 --> 25:30.240\n as an industry and a society from the Boeing 737 MAX crashes?\n\n25:30.240 --> 25:34.720\n These crashes obviously are tremendous tragedies.\n\n25:34.720 --> 25:37.840\n They're tragedies for all of the people,\n\n25:37.840 --> 25:41.240\n the crew, the families, the passengers,\n\n25:41.240 --> 25:43.200\n the people on the ground involved.\n\n25:44.280 --> 25:47.480\n And, you know, it's also a huge business\n\n25:47.480 --> 25:49.080\n and economic setback as well.\n\n25:49.080 --> 25:51.120\n I mean, you know, we've seen that it's impacting\n\n25:51.120 --> 25:53.840\n essentially the trade balance of the US.\n\n25:53.840 --> 25:58.400\n So these are important questions.\n\n25:58.400 --> 26:00.200\n And these are the kinds that, you know,\n\n26:00.200 --> 26:03.040\n we've seen similar kinds of questioning at times.\n\n26:03.040 --> 26:05.960\n You know, you go back to the Challenger accident.\n\n26:06.920 --> 26:10.600\n And it is, I think, always important to remind ourselves\n\n26:10.600 --> 26:14.000\n that humans are fallible, that the systems we create,\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.540\n as perfect as we strive to make them,\n\n26:16.540 --> 26:18.920\n we can always make them better.\n\n26:18.920 --> 26:21.720\n And so another element of that culture of mission success\n\n26:21.720 --> 26:24.960\n is really that commitment to continuous improvement.\n\n26:24.960 --> 26:27.480\n If there's something that goes wrong,\n\n26:27.480 --> 26:31.120\n a real commitment to root cause\n\n26:31.120 --> 26:33.320\n and true root cause understanding,\n\n26:33.320 --> 26:35.080\n to taking the corrective actions\n\n26:35.080 --> 26:38.880\n and to making the future systems better.\n\n26:38.880 --> 26:43.880\n And certainly we strive for, you know, no accidents.\n\n26:45.120 --> 26:47.720\n And if you look at the record\n\n26:47.720 --> 26:50.440\n of the commercial airline industry as a whole\n\n26:50.440 --> 26:52.960\n and the commercial aircraft industry as a whole,\n\n26:52.960 --> 26:57.600\n you know, there's a very nice decaying exponential\n\n26:57.600 --> 26:59.120\n to years now where we have\n\n26:59.120 --> 27:02.920\n no commercial aircraft accidents at all, right?\n\n27:02.920 --> 27:04.720\n Fatal accidents at all.\n\n27:04.720 --> 27:08.320\n So that didn't happen by accident.\n\n27:08.320 --> 27:11.640\n It was through the regulatory agencies, FAA,\n\n27:11.640 --> 27:16.040\n the airframe manufacturers really working on a system\n\n27:16.040 --> 27:20.480\n to identify root causes and drive them out.\n\n27:20.480 --> 27:23.840\n So maybe we can take a step back\n\n27:23.840 --> 27:28.840\n and many people are familiar, but Lockheed Martin broadly,\n\n27:28.840 --> 27:31.200\n what kind of categories of systems\n\n27:32.100 --> 27:34.260\n are you involved in building?\n\n27:34.260 --> 27:36.240\n You know, Lockheed Martin, we think of ourselves\n\n27:36.240 --> 27:39.880\n as a company that solves hard mission problems.\n\n27:39.880 --> 27:43.040\n And the output of that might be an airplane or a spacecraft\n\n27:43.040 --> 27:45.680\n or a helicopter or a radar or something like that.\n\n27:45.680 --> 27:48.600\n But ultimately we're driven by these, you know,\n\n27:48.600 --> 27:50.240\n what is our customer?\n\n27:50.240 --> 27:52.760\n What is that mission that they need to achieve?\n\n27:52.760 --> 27:55.520\n And so that's what drove the SR71, right?\n\n27:55.520 --> 27:57.840\n How do you get pictures of a place\n\n27:59.040 --> 28:02.200\n where you've got sophisticated air defense systems\n\n28:02.200 --> 28:05.480\n that are capable of handling any aircraft\n\n28:05.480 --> 28:07.480\n that was out there at the time, right?\n\n28:07.480 --> 28:10.480\n So that, you know, that's what yielded an SR71.\n\n28:10.480 --> 28:12.500\n Let's build a nice flying camera.\n\n28:12.500 --> 28:13.340\n Exactly.\n\n28:13.340 --> 28:15.960\n And make sure it gets out and it gets back, right?\n\n28:15.960 --> 28:18.320\n And that led ultimately to really the start\n\n28:18.320 --> 28:20.480\n of the space program in the US as well.\n\n28:22.240 --> 28:24.960\n So now take a step back to Lockheed Martin of today.\n\n28:24.960 --> 28:29.080\n And we are, you know, on the order of 105 years old now\n\n28:29.080 --> 28:32.440\n between Lockheed and Martin, the two big heritage companies.\n\n28:32.440 --> 28:33.600\n Of course, we're made up of a whole bunch\n\n28:33.600 --> 28:36.160\n of other companies that came in as well.\n\n28:36.160 --> 28:39.000\n General Dynamics, you know, kind of go down the list.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:43.460\n Today, you can think of us in this space\n\n28:43.460 --> 28:44.860\n of solving mission problems.\n\n28:44.860 --> 28:49.860\n So obviously on the aircraft side, tactical aircraft,\n\n28:50.140 --> 28:53.020\n building the most advanced fighter aircraft\n\n28:53.020 --> 28:55.140\n that the world has ever seen.\n\n28:55.140 --> 28:57.940\n We're up to now several hundred of those delivered,\n\n28:57.940 --> 29:00.140\n building almost a hundred a year.\n\n29:00.140 --> 29:04.140\n And of course, working on the things that come after that.\n\n29:04.140 --> 29:06.700\n On the space side, we are engaged\n\n29:06.700 --> 29:11.700\n in pretty much every venue of space utilization\n\n29:12.380 --> 29:14.300\n and exploration you can imagine.\n\n29:14.300 --> 29:18.100\n So I mentioned things like navigation and timing GPS,\n\n29:18.100 --> 29:22.460\n communication satellites, missile warning satellites.\n\n29:22.460 --> 29:24.820\n We've built commercial surveillance satellites.\n\n29:24.820 --> 29:27.700\n We've built commercial communication satellites.\n\n29:27.700 --> 29:29.260\n We do civil space.\n\n29:29.260 --> 29:32.360\n So everything from human exploration\n\n29:32.360 --> 29:35.040\n to the robotic exploration of the outer planets.\n\n29:35.040 --> 29:39.120\n And keep going on the space front.\n\n29:39.120 --> 29:42.520\n But a couple of other areas that I'd like to put out,\n\n29:42.520 --> 29:45.560\n we're heavily engaged in building\n\n29:45.560 --> 29:47.440\n critical defensive systems.\n\n29:47.440 --> 29:51.680\n And so a couple that I'll mention, the Aegis Combat System.\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:54.600\n This is basically the integrated air and missile defense\n\n29:54.600 --> 29:58.660\n system for the US and allied fleets.\n\n29:58.660 --> 30:03.660\n And so protects carrier strike groups, for example,\n\n30:03.660 --> 30:06.380\n from incoming ballistic missile threats,\n\n30:06.380 --> 30:08.300\n aircraft threats, cruise missile threats,\n\n30:08.300 --> 30:09.900\n and kind of go down the list.\n\n30:09.900 --> 30:13.060\n So the carriers, the fleet itself\n\n30:13.060 --> 30:15.300\n is the thing that is being protected.\n\n30:15.300 --> 30:17.180\n The carriers aren't serving\n\n30:17.180 --> 30:19.180\n as a protection for something else.\n\n30:19.180 --> 30:21.660\n Well, that's a little bit of a different application.\n\n30:21.660 --> 30:24.180\n We've actually built the version called Aegis Ashore,\n\n30:24.180 --> 30:27.740\n which is now deployed in a couple of places around the world.\n\n30:27.740 --> 30:32.300\n So that same technology, I mean, basically can be used\n\n30:32.300 --> 30:35.180\n to protect either an ocean going fleet\n\n30:35.180 --> 30:37.620\n or a land based activity.\n\n30:37.620 --> 30:39.460\n Another one, the THAAD program.\n\n30:40.860 --> 30:44.500\n So THAAD, this is the Theater High Altitude Area Defense.\n\n30:45.420 --> 30:49.500\n This is to protect relatively broad areas\n\n30:49.500 --> 30:53.900\n against sophisticated ballistic missile threats.\n\n30:53.900 --> 30:58.900\n And so now it's deployed with a lot of US capabilities.\n\n30:58.900 --> 31:00.980\n And now we have international customers\n\n31:00.980 --> 31:03.300\n that are looking to buy that capability as well.\n\n31:03.300 --> 31:05.900\n And so these are systems that defend,\n\n31:05.900 --> 31:09.020\n not just defend militaries and military capabilities,\n\n31:09.020 --> 31:11.300\n but defend population areas.\n\n31:12.300 --> 31:15.900\n We saw maybe the first public use of these\n\n31:15.900 --> 31:19.860\n back in the first Gulf War with the Patriot Systems.\n\n31:20.820 --> 31:22.700\n And these are the kinds of things\n\n31:22.700 --> 31:25.580\n that Lockheed Martin delivers.\n\n31:25.580 --> 31:28.100\n And there's a lot of stuff that goes into it.\n\n31:28.100 --> 31:29.540\n A lot of stuff that goes with it.\n\n31:29.540 --> 31:33.100\n So think about the radar systems and the sensing systems\n\n31:33.100 --> 31:36.740\n that cue these, the command and control systems\n\n31:36.740 --> 31:39.340\n that decide how you pair a weapon\n\n31:39.340 --> 31:40.900\n against an incoming threat.\n\n31:42.300 --> 31:45.420\n And then all the human and machine interfaces\n\n31:45.420 --> 31:48.060\n to make sure that they can be operated successfully\n\n31:48.060 --> 31:51.060\n in very strenuous environments.\n\n31:51.060 --> 31:54.660\n Yeah, there's some incredible engineering\n\n31:54.660 --> 31:57.260\n that at every front, like you said.\n\n31:57.260 --> 32:02.260\n So maybe if we just take a look at Lockheed history broadly,\n\n32:03.500 --> 32:05.660\n maybe even looking at Skunk Works.\n\n32:06.940 --> 32:08.540\n What are the biggest,\n\n32:08.540 --> 32:11.220\n most impressive milestones of innovation?\n\n32:11.220 --> 32:14.900\n So if you look at stealth, I would have called you crazy\n\n32:14.900 --> 32:16.900\n if you said that's possible at the time.\n\n32:17.980 --> 32:21.340\n And supersonic and hypersonic.\n\n32:21.340 --> 32:24.100\n So traveling at, first of all,\n\n32:24.100 --> 32:27.660\n traveling at the speed of sound is pretty damn fast.\n\n32:27.660 --> 32:29.780\n And supersonic and hypersonic,\n\n32:29.780 --> 32:32.260\n three, four, five times the speed of sound.\n\n32:32.260 --> 32:34.460\n That seems, I would also call you crazy\n\n32:34.460 --> 32:35.820\n if you say you can do that.\n\n32:35.820 --> 32:38.140\n So can you tell me how it's possible\n\n32:38.140 --> 32:39.620\n to do these kinds of things?\n\n32:39.620 --> 32:43.100\n And is there other milestones and innovation\n\n32:43.100 --> 32:45.100\n that's going on that you can talk about?\n\n32:45.100 --> 32:45.980\n Yeah.\n\n32:45.980 --> 32:49.060\n Well, let me start on the Skunk Works saga.\n\n32:49.060 --> 32:51.620\n And you kind of alluded to it in the beginning.\n\n32:51.620 --> 32:54.780\n Skunk Works is as much an idea as a place.\n\n32:54.780 --> 32:59.380\n And so it's driven really by Kelly Johnson's 14 principles.\n\n32:59.380 --> 33:01.860\n And I'm not gonna list all 14 of them off,\n\n33:01.860 --> 33:04.340\n but the idea, and this I'm sure will resonate\n\n33:04.340 --> 33:06.100\n with any engineer who's worked\n\n33:06.100 --> 33:09.300\n on a highly motivated small team before.\n\n33:09.300 --> 33:13.260\n The idea that if you can essentially have a small team\n\n33:13.260 --> 33:17.140\n of very capable people who wanna work\n\n33:17.140 --> 33:20.380\n on really hard problems, you can do almost anything.\n\n33:20.380 --> 33:23.140\n Especially if you kind of shield them\n\n33:23.140 --> 33:26.500\n from bureaucratic influences,\n\n33:26.500 --> 33:30.580\n if you create very tight relationships with your customers\n\n33:30.580 --> 33:32.860\n so that you have that team\n\n33:32.860 --> 33:35.860\n and shared vision with the customer.\n\n33:35.860 --> 33:40.220\n Those are the kinds of things that enable the Skunk Works\n\n33:40.220 --> 33:42.860\n to do these incredible things.\n\n33:42.860 --> 33:46.180\n And we listed off a number that you brought up stealth.\n\n33:46.180 --> 33:51.180\n And I wish I could have seen Ben Rich with a ball bearing\n\n33:51.540 --> 33:54.940\n rolling it across the desk to a general officer\n\n33:54.940 --> 33:58.220\n and saying, would you like to have an aircraft\n\n33:58.220 --> 34:01.620\n that has the radar cross section of this ball bearing?\n\n34:01.620 --> 34:04.100\n Probably one of the least expensive\n\n34:04.100 --> 34:06.100\n and most effective marketing campaigns\n\n34:06.100 --> 34:08.220\n in the history of the industry.\n\n34:08.220 --> 34:10.740\n So just for people that are not familiar,\n\n34:10.740 --> 34:13.020\n the way you detect aircraft,\n\n34:13.020 --> 34:14.500\n I'm sure there's a lot of ways,\n\n34:14.500 --> 34:17.340\n but radar for the longest time,\n\n34:17.340 --> 34:20.660\n there's a big blob that appears in the radar.\n\n34:20.660 --> 34:22.380\n How do you make a plane disappear\n\n34:22.380 --> 34:26.180\n so it looks as big as a ball bearing?\n\n34:26.180 --> 34:28.020\n What's involved in technology wise there?\n\n34:28.020 --> 34:32.460\n What's the broadly sort of the stuff you can speak about?\n\n34:32.460 --> 34:34.860\n I'll stick to what's in Ben Rich's book.\n\n34:34.860 --> 34:39.020\n But obviously the geometry of how radar gets reflected\n\n34:39.020 --> 34:42.460\n and the kinds of materials that either reflect or absorb\n\n34:42.460 --> 34:46.500\n are kind of the couple of the critical elements there.\n\n34:46.500 --> 34:48.100\n And it's a cat and mouse game, right?\n\n34:48.100 --> 34:51.300\n I mean, you know, radars get better,\n\n34:51.300 --> 34:52.980\n stealth capabilities get better.\n\n34:52.980 --> 34:55.740\n And so it's a really a game\n\n34:55.740 --> 34:58.500\n of continuous improvement and innovation there.\n\n34:58.500 --> 35:00.180\n I'll leave it at that.\n\n35:00.180 --> 35:04.780\n Yeah, so the idea that something is essentially invisible\n\n35:04.780 --> 35:06.460\n is quite fascinating.\n\n35:06.460 --> 35:08.980\n But the other one is flying fast.\n\n35:08.980 --> 35:13.300\n So speed of sound is 750, 60 miles an hour.\n\n35:15.340 --> 35:18.500\n So supersonic is three, you know, Mach three,\n\n35:18.500 --> 35:19.340\n something like that.\n\n35:19.340 --> 35:21.620\n Yeah, we talk about the supersonic obviously,\n\n35:21.620 --> 35:24.940\n and we kind of talk about that as that realm from Mach one\n\n35:24.940 --> 35:28.500\n up through about Mach five and then hypersonic.\n\n35:28.500 --> 35:33.500\n So, you know, high supersonic speeds would be past Mach five.\n\n35:34.780 --> 35:37.140\n And you got to remember Lockheed Martin\n\n35:37.140 --> 35:39.100\n and actually other companies have been involved\n\n35:39.100 --> 35:42.300\n in hypersonic development since the late 60s.\n\n35:42.300 --> 35:45.380\n You know, you think of everything from the X 15\n\n35:45.380 --> 35:48.060\n to the space shuttle as examples of that.\n\n35:50.100 --> 35:54.380\n I think the difference now is if you look around the world,\n\n35:54.380 --> 35:57.380\n particularly the threat environment that we're in today,\n\n35:57.380 --> 36:00.260\n you're starting to see, you know, publicly,\n\n36:01.540 --> 36:03.580\n folks like the Russians and the Chinese\n\n36:03.580 --> 36:08.340\n saying they have hypersonic weapons capability\n\n36:08.340 --> 36:13.340\n that could threaten US and allied capabilities.\n\n36:14.260 --> 36:17.220\n And also basically, you know, the claims are\n\n36:17.220 --> 36:19.860\n these could get around defensive systems\n\n36:19.860 --> 36:21.820\n that are out there today.\n\n36:21.820 --> 36:24.500\n And so there's a real sense of urgency.\n\n36:24.500 --> 36:28.140\n You hear it from folks like the undersecretary of defense\n\n36:28.140 --> 36:30.780\n for research and engineering, Dr. Mike Griffin,\n\n36:30.780 --> 36:33.940\n and others in the department of defense that hypersonics\n\n36:33.940 --> 36:38.100\n is something that's really important to the nation\n\n36:39.620 --> 36:43.100\n in terms of both parity, but also defensive capabilities.\n\n36:43.100 --> 36:46.220\n And so that's something that, you know, we're pleased.\n\n36:46.220 --> 36:47.860\n It's something that Lockheed Martin's, you know,\n\n36:47.860 --> 36:51.620\n had a heritage in, we've invested R and D dollars\n\n36:51.620 --> 36:53.780\n on our side for many years.\n\n36:53.780 --> 36:56.220\n And we have a number of things going on\n\n36:56.220 --> 36:59.740\n with various US government customers in that field today\n\n36:59.740 --> 37:01.540\n that we're very excited about.\n\n37:01.540 --> 37:04.520\n So I would anticipate we'll be hearing more about that\n\n37:04.520 --> 37:06.260\n in the future from our customers.\n\n37:06.260 --> 37:08.860\n And I've actually haven't read much about this.\n\n37:08.860 --> 37:10.860\n Probably you can't talk about much of it at all,\n\n37:10.860 --> 37:12.780\n but on the defensive side,\n\n37:12.780 --> 37:15.600\n it's a fascinating problem of perception\n\n37:15.600 --> 37:18.380\n of trying to detect things that are really hard to see.\n\n37:18.380 --> 37:21.540\n Can you comment on how hard that problem is\n\n37:21.540 --> 37:26.540\n and how hard is it to stay ahead,\n\n37:26.660 --> 37:29.180\n even if we go back a few decades,\n\n37:29.180 --> 37:30.500\n stay ahead of the competition?\n\n37:30.500 --> 37:33.700\n Well, maybe I'd, again, you gotta think of these\n\n37:33.700 --> 37:36.500\n as ongoing capability development.\n\n37:36.500 --> 37:40.740\n And so think back to the early days of missile defense.\n\n37:40.740 --> 37:44.140\n So this would be in the 80s, the SDI program.\n\n37:44.140 --> 37:47.460\n And in that timeframe, we proved and Lockheed Martin proved\n\n37:47.460 --> 37:50.260\n that you could hit a bullet with a bullet, essentially,\n\n37:50.260 --> 37:53.220\n and which is something that had never been done before\n\n37:53.220 --> 37:56.180\n to take out an incoming ballistic missile.\n\n37:56.180 --> 37:59.300\n And so that's led to these incredible hit to kill\n\n37:59.300 --> 38:01.860\n kinds of capabilities, PAC 3.\n\n38:03.100 --> 38:06.980\n That's the Patriot Advanced Capability Model 3\n\n38:06.980 --> 38:08.120\n that Lockheed Martin builds,\n\n38:08.120 --> 38:10.720\n the THAAD system that I talked about.\n\n38:12.080 --> 38:17.080\n So now hypersonics, they're different from ballistic systems.\n\n38:17.520 --> 38:21.120\n And so we gotta take the next step in defensive capability.\n\n38:21.120 --> 38:25.540\n I can, I'll leave that there, but I can only imagine.\n\n38:26.520 --> 38:29.160\n Now, let me just comment sort of as an engineer,\n\n38:29.160 --> 38:33.440\n it's sad to know that so much that Lockheed has done\n\n38:33.440 --> 38:38.440\n in the past is classified or today,\n\n38:38.840 --> 38:40.940\n and it's shrouded in secrecy.\n\n38:40.940 --> 38:44.720\n It has to be by the nature of the application.\n\n38:46.200 --> 38:49.200\n So like what I do, so what we do here at MIT,\n\n38:49.200 --> 38:53.920\n we would like to inspire young engineers, young scientists,\n\n38:53.920 --> 38:56.480\n and yet in the Lockheed case,\n\n38:56.480 --> 38:59.720\n some of that engineer has to stay quiet.\n\n38:59.720 --> 39:00.920\n How do you think about that?\n\n39:00.920 --> 39:02.120\n How does that make you feel?\n\n39:02.120 --> 39:07.120\n Is there a future where more can be shown\n\n39:08.120 --> 39:11.240\n or is it just the nature of this world\n\n39:11.240 --> 39:13.400\n that it has to remain secret?\n\n39:13.400 --> 39:15.680\n It's a good question.\n\n39:15.680 --> 39:20.680\n I think the public can see enough of,\n\n39:21.840 --> 39:25.600\n and including students who may be in grade school,\n\n39:25.600 --> 39:27.780\n high school, college today,\n\n39:28.840 --> 39:32.440\n to understand the kinds of really hard problems\n\n39:32.440 --> 39:34.120\n that we work on.\n\n39:34.120 --> 39:36.840\n And I mean, look at the F35, right?\n\n39:36.840 --> 39:41.320\n And obviously a lot of the detailed performance levels\n\n39:41.320 --> 39:43.880\n are sensitive and controlled.\n\n39:43.880 --> 39:48.760\n But we can talk about what an incredible aircraft this is,\n\n39:48.760 --> 39:51.260\n supersonic, super cruise, kind of a fighter,\n\n39:53.600 --> 39:55.200\n stealth capabilities.\n\n39:55.200 --> 39:58.600\n It's a flying information system in the sky\n\n39:58.600 --> 40:02.160\n with data fusion, sensor fusion capabilities\n\n40:02.160 --> 40:03.820\n that have never been seen before.\n\n40:03.820 --> 40:06.240\n So these are the kinds of things that I believe,\n\n40:06.240 --> 40:08.000\n these are the kinds of things that got me excited\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:08.960\n when I was a student.\n\n40:08.960 --> 40:12.240\n I think these still inspire students today.\n\n40:12.240 --> 40:14.080\n And the other thing I'd say,\n\n40:14.080 --> 40:17.040\n I mean, people are inspired by space.\n\n40:17.040 --> 40:20.220\n People are inspired by aircraft.\n\n40:21.980 --> 40:25.360\n Our employees are also inspired by that sense of mission.\n\n40:25.360 --> 40:27.560\n And I'll just give you an example.\n\n40:27.560 --> 40:30.840\n I had the privilege to work\n\n40:30.840 --> 40:34.400\n and lead our GPS programs for some time.\n\n40:34.400 --> 40:39.200\n And that was a case where I actually worked on a program\n\n40:39.200 --> 40:41.760\n that touches billions of people every day.\n\n40:41.760 --> 40:43.520\n And so when I said, I worked on GPS,\n\n40:43.520 --> 40:45.280\n everybody knew what I was talking about,\n\n40:45.280 --> 40:46.900\n even though they didn't maybe appreciate\n\n40:46.900 --> 40:50.260\n the technical challenges that went into that.\n\n40:51.440 --> 40:55.020\n But I'll tell you, I got a briefing one time\n\n40:55.020 --> 40:57.480\n from a major in the Air Force.\n\n40:57.480 --> 41:02.480\n And he said, I go by callsign GIMP, GPS is my passion.\n\n41:04.720 --> 41:05.760\n I love GPS.\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:09.000\n And he was involved in the operational test of the system.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.720\n And he said, I was out in Iraq,\n\n41:11.720 --> 41:16.140\n and I was on a helicopter, Blackhawk helicopter,\n\n41:17.480 --> 41:20.480\n and I was bringing back a sergeant\n\n41:20.480 --> 41:23.840\n and a handful of troops from a deployed location.\n\n41:23.840 --> 41:26.640\n And he said, my job is GPS.\n\n41:26.640 --> 41:27.880\n So I asked that sergeant,\n\n41:27.880 --> 41:31.420\n and he's beaten down and kind of half asleep.\n\n41:31.420 --> 41:34.120\n And I said, what do you think about GPS?\n\n41:34.120 --> 41:36.000\n And he brightened up, his eyes lit up,\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:37.640\n and he said, well, GPS,\n\n41:37.640 --> 41:40.000\n that brings me and my troops home every day.\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:41.160\n I love GPS.\n\n41:41.160 --> 41:43.020\n And that's the kind of story where it's like,\n\n41:43.020 --> 41:45.680\n okay, I'm really making a difference here\n\n41:45.680 --> 41:46.520\n in the kind of work.\n\n41:46.520 --> 41:49.000\n So that mission piece is really important.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.120\n The last thing I'll say is,\n\n41:51.120 --> 41:53.800\n and this gets to some of these questions\n\n41:53.800 --> 41:56.180\n around advanced technologies.\n\n41:56.180 --> 41:58.800\n It's not, they're not just airplanes\n\n41:58.800 --> 42:00.020\n and spacecraft anymore.\n\n42:00.020 --> 42:01.480\n For people who are excited\n\n42:01.480 --> 42:03.540\n about advanced software capabilities,\n\n42:03.540 --> 42:06.080\n about AI, about bringing machine learning,\n\n42:06.080 --> 42:08.280\n these are the things that we're doing\n\n42:08.280 --> 42:13.000\n to exponentially increase the mission capabilities\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:14.400\n that go on those platforms.\n\n42:14.400 --> 42:15.600\n And those are the kinds of things\n\n42:15.600 --> 42:18.480\n that I think are more and more visible to the public.\n\n42:18.480 --> 42:21.540\n Yeah, I think autonomy, especially in flight,\n\n42:21.540 --> 42:23.120\n is super exciting.\n\n42:23.120 --> 42:28.120\n Do you see a day, here we go, back into philosophy,\n\n42:28.160 --> 42:30.200\n future when most fighter jets\n\n42:30.200 --> 42:35.200\n will be highly autonomous to a degree\n\n42:35.720 --> 42:38.900\n where a human doesn't need to be in the cockpit\n\n42:38.900 --> 42:40.640\n in almost all cases?\n\n42:40.640 --> 42:42.400\n Well, I mean, that's a world\n\n42:42.400 --> 42:44.240\n that to a certain extent we're in today.\n\n42:44.240 --> 42:47.820\n Now these are remotely piloted aircraft, to be sure.\n\n42:47.820 --> 42:52.820\n But we have hundreds of thousands of flight hours a year now\n\n42:53.920 --> 42:55.800\n in remotely piloted aircraft.\n\n42:55.800 --> 42:58.440\n And then if you take the F35,\n\n42:58.440 --> 43:03.440\n there are huge layers, I guess,\n\n43:03.580 --> 43:06.260\n in levels of autonomy built into that aircraft\n\n43:06.260 --> 43:11.260\n so that the pilot is essentially more of a mission manager\n\n43:11.900 --> 43:13.780\n rather than doing the data,\n\n43:13.780 --> 43:17.220\n the second to second elements of flying the aircraft.\n\n43:17.220 --> 43:19.540\n So in some ways it's the easiest aircraft\n\n43:19.540 --> 43:20.860\n in the world to fly.\n\n43:20.860 --> 43:22.540\n And kind of a funny story on that.\n\n43:22.540 --> 43:23.980\n So I don't know if you know\n\n43:23.980 --> 43:27.320\n how aircraft carrier landings work,\n\n43:27.320 --> 43:30.860\n but basically there's what's called a tail hook\n\n43:30.860 --> 43:33.820\n and it catches wires on the deck of the carrier.\n\n43:33.820 --> 43:37.340\n And that's what brings the aircraft\n\n43:37.340 --> 43:39.440\n to a screeching halt, right?\n\n43:39.440 --> 43:41.860\n And there's typically three of these wires.\n\n43:41.860 --> 43:43.540\n So if you miss the first, the second one,\n\n43:43.540 --> 43:45.980\n you catch the next one, right?\n\n43:45.980 --> 43:49.580\n And we got a little criticism.\n\n43:49.580 --> 43:50.940\n I don't know how true this story is,\n\n43:50.940 --> 43:52.460\n but we got a little criticism.\n\n43:52.460 --> 43:56.260\n The F35 is so perfect, it always gets the second wires.\n\n43:56.260 --> 44:00.940\n We're wearing out the wire because it always hits that one.\n\n44:00.940 --> 44:04.660\n But that's the kind of autonomy that just makes these,\n\n44:04.660 --> 44:06.980\n essentially up levels what the human is doing\n\n44:06.980 --> 44:08.620\n to more of that mission manager.\n\n44:08.620 --> 44:12.140\n So much of that landing by the F35 is autonomous.\n\n44:12.140 --> 44:14.500\n Well, it's just, the control systems are such\n\n44:14.500 --> 44:17.140\n that you really have dialed out the variability\n\n44:18.020 --> 44:20.020\n that comes with all the environmental conditions.\n\n44:20.020 --> 44:20.860\n You're wearing it out.\n\n44:20.860 --> 44:24.380\n So my point is to a certain extent,\n\n44:24.380 --> 44:26.180\n that world is here today.\n\n44:27.420 --> 44:30.060\n Do I think that we're gonna see a day anytime soon\n\n44:30.060 --> 44:31.900\n when there are no humans in the cockpit?\n\n44:31.900 --> 44:33.420\n I don't believe that.\n\n44:33.420 --> 44:35.940\n But I do think we're gonna see much more\n\n44:35.940 --> 44:38.820\n human machine teaming, and we're gonna see that much more\n\n44:38.820 --> 44:40.580\n at the tactical edge.\n\n44:40.580 --> 44:42.100\n And we did a demo, and you asked about\n\n44:42.100 --> 44:43.840\n what the Skunk Works is doing these days.\n\n44:43.840 --> 44:46.260\n And so this is something I can talk about,\n\n44:46.260 --> 44:49.580\n but we did a demo with the Air Force Research Laboratory.\n\n44:51.300 --> 44:52.700\n We called it Have Raider.\n\n44:52.700 --> 44:57.700\n And so using an F16 as an autonomous wingman,\n\n44:59.860 --> 45:02.540\n and we demonstrated all kinds of maneuvers\n\n45:02.540 --> 45:06.340\n and various mission scenarios with the autonomous F16\n\n45:06.340 --> 45:09.540\n being that so called loyal or trusted wingman.\n\n45:09.540 --> 45:12.140\n And so those are the kinds of things that,\n\n45:12.140 --> 45:15.500\n we've shown what is possible now.\n\n45:15.500 --> 45:17.940\n Given that you've up leveled that pilot\n\n45:17.940 --> 45:20.380\n to be a mission manager, now they can control\n\n45:20.380 --> 45:22.340\n multiple other aircraft.\n\n45:22.340 --> 45:25.100\n Think of them almost as extensions of your own aircraft\n\n45:25.100 --> 45:27.220\n flying alongside with you.\n\n45:27.220 --> 45:30.340\n So that's another example of how this is really\n\n45:30.340 --> 45:31.580\n coming to fruition.\n\n45:31.580 --> 45:35.220\n And then I mentioned the landings,\n\n45:35.220 --> 45:39.100\n but think about just the implications for humans\n\n45:39.100 --> 45:41.100\n and flight safety, and this goes a little bit back\n\n45:41.100 --> 45:43.340\n to the discussion we were having about\n\n45:43.340 --> 45:47.820\n how do you continuously improve the level of safety\n\n45:47.820 --> 45:51.400\n through automation while working through the complexities\n\n45:51.400 --> 45:53.420\n that automation introduces.\n\n45:53.420 --> 45:54.820\n So one of the challenges that you have\n\n45:54.820 --> 45:57.540\n in high performance fighter aircraft is what's called G lock.\n\n45:57.540 --> 46:00.060\n So this is G induced loss of consciousness.\n\n46:00.060 --> 46:02.900\n So you pull nine Gs, you're wearing a pressure suit,\n\n46:02.900 --> 46:05.860\n that's not enough to keep the blood going to your brain,\n\n46:05.860 --> 46:06.940\n you black out.\n\n46:07.860 --> 46:12.400\n And of course that's bad if you happen to be flying low,\n\n46:12.400 --> 46:17.400\n near the deck and in an obstacle or terrain environment.\n\n46:17.400 --> 46:22.400\n And so we developed a system in our aeronautics division\n\n46:22.480 --> 46:25.560\n called Auto Gcast, so autonomous ground collision\n\n46:25.560 --> 46:27.480\n avoidance system.\n\n46:27.480 --> 46:30.120\n And we built that into the F16.\n\n46:30.120 --> 46:33.080\n It's actually saved seven aircraft, eight pilots already\n\n46:33.080 --> 46:35.920\n in a relatively short time it's been deployed.\n\n46:35.920 --> 46:39.360\n It was so successful that the Air Force said,\n\n46:39.360 --> 46:41.500\n hey, we need to have this in the F35 right away.\n\n46:41.500 --> 46:45.420\n So we've actually done testing of that now on the F35.\n\n46:45.420 --> 46:49.360\n And we've also integrated an autonomous\n\n46:49.360 --> 46:51.040\n air collision avoidance system.\n\n46:51.040 --> 46:52.960\n So think the air to air problem.\n\n46:52.960 --> 46:56.080\n So now it's the integrated collision avoidance system.\n\n46:56.080 --> 46:58.800\n But these are the kinds of capabilities,\n\n46:58.800 --> 46:59.960\n I wouldn't call them AI.\n\n46:59.960 --> 47:03.120\n I mean, they're very sophisticated models\n\n47:04.080 --> 47:08.120\n of the aircraft dynamics coupled with the terrain models\n\n47:08.120 --> 47:12.160\n to be able to predict when essentially the pilot\n\n47:12.160 --> 47:14.640\n is doing something that is gonna take the aircraft\n\n47:14.640 --> 47:17.280\n or the pilot's not doing something in this case.\n\n47:18.160 --> 47:22.560\n But it just gives you an example of how autonomy\n\n47:22.560 --> 47:25.960\n can be really a lifesaver in today's world.\n\n47:25.960 --> 47:30.560\n It's like a autonomous automated emergency braking in cars.\n\n47:30.560 --> 47:34.640\n But is there any exploration of perception of,\n\n47:34.640 --> 47:39.640\n for example, detecting a G lock that the pilot is out?\n\n47:39.680 --> 47:43.000\n So as opposed to perceiving the external environment\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:44.480\n to infer that the pilot is out,\n\n47:44.480 --> 47:47.400\n but actually perceiving the pilot directly.\n\n47:47.400 --> 47:48.760\n Yeah, this is one of those cases\n\n47:48.760 --> 47:50.800\n where you'd like to not take action\n\n47:50.800 --> 47:52.120\n if you think the pilot's there.\n\n47:52.120 --> 47:54.800\n And it's almost like systems that try to detect\n\n47:54.800 --> 47:57.740\n if a driver's falling asleep on the road, right?\n\n47:57.740 --> 48:00.040\n With limited success.\n\n48:00.040 --> 48:02.120\n So, I mean, this is what I call\n\n48:02.120 --> 48:03.800\n the system of last resort, right?\n\n48:03.800 --> 48:06.980\n Where if the aircraft has determined\n\n48:06.980 --> 48:10.960\n that it's going into the terrain, get it out of there.\n\n48:10.960 --> 48:13.600\n And this is not something that we're just doing\n\n48:13.600 --> 48:15.720\n in the aircraft world.\n\n48:15.720 --> 48:16.940\n And I wanted to highlight,\n\n48:16.940 --> 48:18.660\n we have a technology we call Matrix,\n\n48:18.660 --> 48:22.000\n but this is developed at Sikorsky Innovations.\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:26.120\n The whole idea there is what we call optimal piloting.\n\n48:26.120 --> 48:31.120\n So not optional piloting or unpiloted, but optimal piloting.\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:35.120\n So an FAA certified system.\n\n48:35.120 --> 48:37.480\n So you have a high degree of confidence.\n\n48:37.480 --> 48:40.600\n It's generally pretty deterministic.\n\n48:40.600 --> 48:43.940\n So we know that it'll do in different situations,\n\n48:43.940 --> 48:48.160\n but effectively be able to fly a mission\n\n48:48.160 --> 48:51.560\n with two pilots, one pilot, no pilots.\n\n48:51.560 --> 48:56.080\n And you can think of it almost as like a dial\n\n48:56.080 --> 48:58.360\n of the level of autonomy that you want,\n\n48:58.360 --> 49:01.340\n but able, so it's running in the background at all times\n\n49:01.340 --> 49:03.280\n and able to pick up tasks,\n\n49:03.280 --> 49:05.960\n whether it's sort of autopilot kinds of tasks\n\n49:05.960 --> 49:10.960\n or more sophisticated path planning kinds of activities\n\n49:12.080 --> 49:14.280\n to be able to do things like, for example,\n\n49:14.280 --> 49:16.960\n land on an oil rig in the North Sea\n\n49:16.960 --> 49:19.560\n in bad weather, zero, zero conditions.\n\n49:19.560 --> 49:20.780\n And you can imagine, of course,\n\n49:20.780 --> 49:24.600\n there's a lot of military utility to capability like that.\n\n49:24.600 --> 49:27.320\n You could have an aircraft that you want to send out\n\n49:27.320 --> 49:29.800\n for a crewed mission, but then at night,\n\n49:29.800 --> 49:31.920\n if you want to use it to deliver supplies\n\n49:31.920 --> 49:35.600\n in an unmanned mode, that could be done as well.\n\n49:35.600 --> 49:40.040\n And so there's clear advantages there.\n\n49:40.040 --> 49:41.880\n But think about on the commercial side,\n\n49:41.880 --> 49:44.440\n if you're an aircraft taken,\n\n49:44.440 --> 49:46.120\n you're gonna fly out to this oil rig.\n\n49:46.120 --> 49:48.000\n If you get out there and you can't land,\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.660\n then you gotta bring all those people back,\n\n49:50.660 --> 49:51.880\n reschedule another flight,\n\n49:51.880 --> 49:54.680\n pay the overtime for the crew that you just brought back\n\n49:54.680 --> 49:55.720\n because they didn't get where they were going,\n\n49:55.720 --> 49:57.200\n pay for the overtime for the folks\n\n49:57.200 --> 49:58.680\n that are out there in the oil rig.\n\n49:58.680 --> 50:00.760\n This is real economic,\n\n50:00.760 --> 50:03.520\n these are dollars and cents kinds of advantages\n\n50:03.520 --> 50:06.080\n we're bringing in the commercial world as well.\n\n50:06.080 --> 50:09.200\n So here's a difficult question from the AI space\n\n50:09.200 --> 50:11.680\n that I would love it if you're able to comment.\n\n50:11.680 --> 50:15.440\n So a lot of this autonomy in AI you've mentioned just now\n\n50:15.440 --> 50:17.080\n has this empowering effect.\n\n50:17.080 --> 50:20.420\n One is the last resort, it keeps you safe.\n\n50:20.420 --> 50:22.900\n The other is there's a, with the teaming\n\n50:22.900 --> 50:27.900\n and in general, assistive AI.\n\n50:29.080 --> 50:33.140\n And I think there's always a race.\n\n50:33.140 --> 50:36.960\n So the world is full of, the world is complex.\n\n50:36.960 --> 50:41.120\n It's full of bad actors.\n\n50:41.120 --> 50:43.640\n So there's often a race to make sure\n\n50:43.640 --> 50:47.200\n that we keep this country safe, right?\n\n50:48.700 --> 50:52.000\n But with AI, there is a concern\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:55.140\n that it's a slightly different race.\n\n50:55.140 --> 50:56.800\n Though there's a lot of people in the AI space\n\n50:56.800 --> 50:59.620\n that are concerned about the AI arms race.\n\n50:59.620 --> 51:03.360\n That as opposed to the United States becoming,\n\n51:04.240 --> 51:07.440\n having the best technology and therefore keeping us safe,\n\n51:07.440 --> 51:11.560\n even we lose ability to keep control of it.\n\n51:11.560 --> 51:14.560\n So this, the AI arms race getting away\n\n51:14.560 --> 51:16.800\n from all of us humans.\n\n51:16.800 --> 51:19.480\n So do you share this worry?\n\n51:19.480 --> 51:20.680\n Do you share this concern\n\n51:20.680 --> 51:23.440\n when we're talking about military applications\n\n51:23.440 --> 51:27.280\n that too much control and decision making capabilities\n\n51:27.280 --> 51:30.460\n giving to software or AI?\n\n51:31.680 --> 51:34.160\n Well, I don't see it happening today.\n\n51:34.160 --> 51:38.400\n And in fact, this is something from a policy perspective,\n\n51:38.400 --> 51:40.000\n it's obviously a very dynamic space,\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.440\n but the Department of Defense has put quite a bit\n\n51:42.440 --> 51:44.320\n of thought into that.\n\n51:44.320 --> 51:46.600\n And maybe before talking about the policy,\n\n51:46.600 --> 51:48.960\n I'll just talk about some of the why.\n\n51:48.960 --> 51:52.280\n And you alluded to it being a sort of a complicated\n\n51:52.280 --> 51:54.080\n and a little bit scary world out there,\n\n51:54.080 --> 51:57.360\n but there's some big things happening today.\n\n51:57.360 --> 51:59.460\n You hear a lot of talk now about a return\n\n51:59.460 --> 52:01.520\n to great powers competition,\n\n52:01.520 --> 52:05.480\n particularly around China and Russia with the US,\n\n52:05.480 --> 52:08.820\n but there are some other big players out there as well.\n\n52:10.040 --> 52:14.640\n And what we've seen is the deployment of some very,\n\n52:16.140 --> 52:20.520\n I'd say concerning new weapon systems,\n\n52:20.520 --> 52:23.040\n particularly with Russia and breaching\n\n52:23.040 --> 52:24.560\n some of the IRBM,\n\n52:24.560 --> 52:26.480\n Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile Treaties,\n\n52:26.480 --> 52:27.920\n that's been in the news a lot.\n\n52:29.480 --> 52:33.040\n The building of islands, artificial islands\n\n52:33.040 --> 52:35.160\n in the South China Sea by the Chinese\n\n52:35.160 --> 52:37.820\n and then arming those islands.\n\n52:38.760 --> 52:42.960\n The annexation of Crimea by Russia,\n\n52:42.960 --> 52:44.840\n the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n52:44.840 --> 52:47.200\n So there's some pretty scary things.\n\n52:47.200 --> 52:48.860\n And then you add on top of that,\n\n52:49.760 --> 52:53.000\n the North Korean threat has certainly not gone away.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:54.740\n There's a lot going on in the Middle East\n\n52:54.740 --> 52:56.680\n with Iran in particular.\n\n52:56.680 --> 53:01.680\n And we see this global terrorism threat has not abated.\n\n53:02.360 --> 53:06.100\n So there are a lot of reasons to look for technology\n\n53:06.100 --> 53:07.680\n to assist with those problems,\n\n53:07.680 --> 53:11.360\n whether it's AI or other technologies like hypersonics,\n\n53:11.360 --> 53:12.960\n which we discussed.\n\n53:12.960 --> 53:17.320\n So now let me give just a couple of hypotheticals.\n\n53:17.320 --> 53:23.320\n So people react sort of in the second timeframe, right?\n\n53:24.840 --> 53:27.800\n Photon hitting your eye to movement\n\n53:27.800 --> 53:30.600\n is on the order of a few tenths of a second\n\n53:30.600 --> 53:33.240\n kinds of processing time.\n\n53:34.440 --> 53:36.560\n Roughly speaking,\n\n53:36.560 --> 53:41.560\n computers are operating in the nanosecond timescale, right?\n\n53:41.560 --> 53:44.620\n So just to bring home what that means,\n\n53:44.620 --> 53:49.620\n a nanosecond to a second is like a second to 32 years.\n\n53:50.640 --> 53:53.040\n So seconds on the battlefield,\n\n53:53.040 --> 53:55.660\n in that sense, literally are lifetimes.\n\n53:56.600 --> 54:01.040\n And so if you can bring an autonomous\n\n54:01.040 --> 54:03.260\n or AI enabled capability\n\n54:03.260 --> 54:05.640\n that will enable the human to shrink,\n\n54:05.640 --> 54:07.540\n maybe you've heard the term the OODA loop.\n\n54:07.540 --> 54:12.160\n So this whole idea that a typical battlefield decision\n\n54:12.160 --> 54:15.800\n is characterized by observe.\n\n54:15.800 --> 54:18.400\n So information comes in, orient.\n\n54:18.400 --> 54:21.240\n How does that, what does that mean in the context?\n\n54:21.240 --> 54:23.040\n Decide, what do I do about it?\n\n54:23.040 --> 54:25.160\n And then act, take that action.\n\n54:25.160 --> 54:29.880\n If you can use these capabilities to compress that OODA loop\n\n54:29.880 --> 54:32.240\n to stay inside what your adversary is doing,\n\n54:32.240 --> 54:37.240\n that's an incredible powerful force on the battlefield.\n\n54:37.680 --> 54:39.120\n That's a really nice way to put it,\n\n54:39.120 --> 54:41.680\n that the role of AI and computing in general\n\n54:41.680 --> 54:45.160\n has a lot to benefit from just decreasing\n\n54:45.160 --> 54:47.240\n from 32 years to one second,\n\n54:47.240 --> 54:50.560\n as opposed to on the scale of seconds and minutes and hours\n\n54:50.560 --> 54:53.440\n making decisions that humans are better at making.\n\n54:53.440 --> 54:54.960\n And it actually goes the other way too.\n\n54:54.960 --> 54:57.160\n So that's on the short timescale.\n\n54:57.160 --> 54:59.760\n So humans kind of work in the one second,\n\n54:59.760 --> 55:01.520\n two seconds to eight hours.\n\n55:01.520 --> 55:03.360\n After eight hours, you get tired,\n\n55:04.320 --> 55:07.480\n you gotta go to the bathroom, whatever the case might be.\n\n55:07.480 --> 55:09.720\n So there's this whole range of other things.\n\n55:09.720 --> 55:14.720\n Think about surveillance and guarding facilities.\n\n55:16.560 --> 55:20.520\n Think about moving material, logistics, sustainment.\n\n55:20.520 --> 55:22.600\n A lot of these, what they call dull, dirty\n\n55:22.600 --> 55:24.520\n and dangerous things that you need\n\n55:24.520 --> 55:26.160\n to have sustained activity,\n\n55:26.160 --> 55:28.000\n but it's sort of beyond the length of time\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.920\n that a human can practically do as well.\n\n55:30.920 --> 55:35.240\n So there's this range of things that are critical\n\n55:36.400 --> 55:39.120\n in military and defense applications\n\n55:39.120 --> 55:43.240\n that AI and autonomy are particularly well suited to.\n\n55:43.240 --> 55:46.040\n Now, the interesting question that you brought up is,\n\n55:46.040 --> 55:49.840\n okay, how do you make sure that stays within human control?\n\n55:49.840 --> 55:52.360\n So that was the context for now the policy.\n\n55:52.360 --> 55:56.160\n And so there is a DOD directive called 3000.09\n\n55:56.160 --> 55:58.760\n because that's the way we name stuff in this world.\n\n56:00.760 --> 56:04.280\n But I'd say it's well worth reading.\n\n56:04.280 --> 56:05.880\n It's only a couple of pages long,\n\n56:05.880 --> 56:07.280\n but it makes some key points.\n\n56:07.280 --> 56:09.520\n And it's really around making sure\n\n56:09.520 --> 56:12.320\n that there's human agency and control\n\n56:12.320 --> 56:17.320\n over use of semi autonomous and autonomous weapons systems,\n\n56:20.240 --> 56:23.080\n making sure that these systems are tested,\n\n56:23.080 --> 56:25.800\n verified and evaluated in realistic,\n\n56:25.800 --> 56:28.200\n real world type scenarios,\n\n56:28.200 --> 56:30.400\n making sure that the people are actually trained\n\n56:30.400 --> 56:31.880\n on how to use them,\n\n56:31.880 --> 56:36.000\n making sure that the systems have human machine interfaces\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:38.080\n that can show what state they're in\n\n56:38.080 --> 56:40.320\n and what kinds of decisions they're making,\n\n56:40.320 --> 56:42.800\n making sure that you've established doctrine\n\n56:42.800 --> 56:45.800\n and tactics and techniques and procedures\n\n56:45.800 --> 56:48.240\n for the use of these kinds of systems.\n\n56:48.240 --> 56:52.880\n And so, and by the way, I mean, none of this is easy,\n\n56:52.880 --> 56:56.040\n but I'm just trying to lay kind of the picture\n\n56:56.040 --> 56:58.200\n of how the US has said,\n\n56:58.200 --> 57:02.600\n this is the way we're gonna treat AI and autonomous systems,\n\n57:02.600 --> 57:04.600\n that it's not a free for all.\n\n57:04.600 --> 57:08.160\n And like there are rules of war and rules of engagement\n\n57:08.160 --> 57:09.480\n with other kinds of systems,\n\n57:09.480 --> 57:12.200\n think chemical weapons, biological weapons,\n\n57:12.200 --> 57:15.720\n we need to think about the same sorts of implications.\n\n57:15.720 --> 57:17.320\n And this is something that's really important\n\n57:17.320 --> 57:18.160\n for Lockheed Martin.\n\n57:18.160 --> 57:21.600\n I mean, obviously we are a hundred percent complying\n\n57:21.600 --> 57:26.400\n with our customer and the policies and regulations,\n\n57:26.400 --> 57:30.560\n but I mean, AI is an incredible enabler,\n\n57:30.560 --> 57:32.360\n say within the walls of Lockheed Martin\n\n57:32.360 --> 57:35.200\n in terms of improving production efficiency,\n\n57:35.200 --> 57:38.240\n doing helping engineers, doing generative design,\n\n57:38.240 --> 57:42.040\n improving logistics, driving down energy costs.\n\n57:42.040 --> 57:44.360\n I mean, there are so many applications,\n\n57:44.360 --> 57:48.160\n but we're also very interested in some of the elements\n\n57:48.160 --> 57:51.800\n of ethical application within Lockheed Martin.\n\n57:51.800 --> 57:54.360\n So we need to make sure that things like privacy\n\n57:54.360 --> 57:58.480\n is taken care of, that we do everything we can\n\n57:58.480 --> 58:03.480\n to drive out bias in AI enabled kinds of systems,\n\n58:03.480 --> 58:06.320\n that we make sure that humans are involved in decisions,\n\n58:06.320 --> 58:10.640\n that we're not just delegating accountability to algorithms.\n\n58:10.640 --> 58:13.280\n And so for us, it all comes back,\n\n58:13.280 --> 58:14.560\n I talked about culture before,\n\n58:14.560 --> 58:17.920\n and it comes back to sort of the Lockheed Martin culture\n\n58:17.920 --> 58:19.160\n and our core values.\n\n58:19.160 --> 58:21.720\n And so it's pretty simple for us and do what's right,\n\n58:21.720 --> 58:24.280\n respect others, perform with excellence.\n\n58:24.280 --> 58:27.960\n And now how do we tie that back to the ethical principles\n\n58:27.960 --> 58:31.840\n will govern how AI is used within Lockheed Martin.\n\n58:31.840 --> 58:34.400\n And we actually have a world, pretty,\n\n58:34.400 --> 58:35.520\n so you might not know this,\n\n58:35.520 --> 58:37.680\n but there are actually awards for ethics programs.\n\n58:37.680 --> 58:41.400\n Lockheed Martin's had a recognized ethics program\n\n58:41.400 --> 58:42.240\n for many years.\n\n58:42.240 --> 58:44.600\n And this is one of the things that our ethics team\n\n58:44.600 --> 58:46.600\n is working with our engineering team on.\n\n58:47.840 --> 58:51.320\n One of the miracles to me, perhaps a layman,\n\n58:51.320 --> 58:53.760\n again, I was born in the Soviet Union.\n\n58:53.760 --> 58:57.840\n So I have echoes, at least in my family history\n\n58:57.840 --> 59:00.640\n of World War II and the Cold War.\n\n59:00.640 --> 59:04.760\n Do you have a sense of why human civilization\n\n59:04.760 --> 59:07.120\n has not destroyed itself through nuclear war,\n\n59:07.120 --> 59:09.200\n so nuclear deterrence?\n\n59:09.200 --> 59:11.960\n And thinking about the future,\n\n59:11.960 --> 59:14.600\n does this technology have a role to play here?\n\n59:14.600 --> 59:17.400\n And what is the long term future\n\n59:17.400 --> 59:20.440\n of nuclear deterrence look like?\n\n59:20.440 --> 59:24.840\n Yeah, this is one of those hard, hard questions.\n\n59:24.840 --> 59:29.040\n And I should note that Lockheed Martin is both proud\n\n59:29.040 --> 59:31.520\n and privileged to play a part in multiple legs\n\n59:31.520 --> 59:35.920\n of our nuclear and strategic deterrent systems\n\n59:35.920 --> 59:39.920\n like the Trident submarine launch ballistic missiles.\n\n59:42.200 --> 59:47.200\n You talk about, is there still a possibility\n\n59:47.400 --> 59:49.120\n that the human race could destroy itself?\n\n59:49.120 --> 59:50.880\n I'd say that possibility is real.\n\n59:50.880 --> 59:55.480\n But interestingly, in some sense,\n\n59:55.480 --> 1:00:00.040\n I think the strategic deterrence have prevented\n\n1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:03.760\n the kinds of incredibly destructive world wars\n\n1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:07.280\n that we saw in the first half of the 20th century.\n\n1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:10.920\n Now, things have gotten more complicated since that time\n\n1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:12.320\n and since the Cold War.\n\n1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:15.560\n It is more of a multipolar great powers world today.\n\n1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:19.040\n Just to give you an example, back then,\n\n1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:21.880\n there were, in the Cold War timeframe,\n\n1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:23.120\n just a handful of nations\n\n1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:27.000\n that had ballistic missile capability by last count.\n\n1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:28.280\n And this is a few years old.\n\n1:00:28.280 --> 1:00:31.280\n There's over 70 nations today that have that.\n\n1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.880\n Similar kinds of numbers\n\n1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:36.400\n in terms of space based capabilities.\n\n1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:42.600\n So the world has gotten more complex and more challenging\n\n1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:45.640\n and the threats, I think, have proliferated\n\n1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:49.720\n in ways that we didn't expect.\n\n1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:53.280\n The nation today is in the middle of a recapitalization\n\n1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:55.360\n of our strategic deterrent.\n\n1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:58.760\n I look at that as one of the most important things\n\n1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:00.320\n that our nation can do.\n\n1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:01.880\n What is involved in deterrence?\n\n1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:06.880\n Is it being ready to attack\n\n1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:11.560\n or is it the defensive systems that catch attacks?\n\n1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:12.560\n A little bit of both.\n\n1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:16.680\n And so it's a complicated game theoretical kind of program.\n\n1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:19.040\n But ultimately,\n\n1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:24.920\n we are trying to prevent the use of any of these weapons.\n\n1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:29.280\n And the theory behind prevention is that\n\n1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:33.320\n even if an adversary uses a weapon against you,\n\n1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:37.640\n you have the capability to essentially strike back\n\n1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:40.840\n and do harm to them that's unacceptable.\n\n1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:44.960\n And so that will deter them from making use\n\n1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:46.280\n of these weapons systems.\n\n1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:50.800\n The deterrence calculus has changed, of course,\n\n1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:55.160\n with more nations now having these kinds of weapons.\n\n1:01:56.320 --> 1:02:00.120\n But I think from my perspective, it's very important\n\n1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:05.040\n to maintain a strategic deterrent.\n\n1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:08.840\n You have to have systems that you know will work\n\n1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:11.000\n when they're required to work.\n\n1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.560\n Now you know that they have to be adaptable\n\n1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:17.560\n to a variety of different scenarios in today's world.\n\n1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:20.400\n And so that's what this recapitalization of systems\n\n1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:23.240\n that were built over previous decades,\n\n1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:26.640\n making sure that they are appropriate, not just for today,\n\n1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:29.120\n but for the decades to come.\n\n1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:32.200\n So the other thing I'd really like to note\n\n1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:35.800\n is strategic deterrence has a very different\n\n1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:38.880\n character today.\n\n1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:42.400\n We used to think of weapons of mass destruction\n\n1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:45.760\n in terms of nuclear, chemical, biological.\n\n1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:48.680\n And today we have a cyber threat.\n\n1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:53.680\n We've seen examples of the use of cyber weaponry.\n\n1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.560\n And if you think about the possibilities\n\n1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:03.560\n of using cyber capabilities or an adversary attacking the US\n\n1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:07.560\n to take out things like critical infrastructure,\n\n1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:10.240\n electrical grids, water systems,\n\n1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:16.320\n those are scenarios that are strategic in nature\n\n1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:19.080\n to the survival of a nation as well.\n\n1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:23.080\n So that is the kind of world that we live in today.\n\n1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:28.080\n And part of my hope on this is one that we can also develop\n\n1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:30.920\n technical or technological systems,\n\n1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:33.640\n perhaps enabled by AI and autonomy,\n\n1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:38.640\n that will allow us to contain and to fight back\n\n1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:41.880\n against these kinds of new threats\n\n1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:44.840\n that were not conceived when we first developed\n\n1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:46.280\n our strategic deterrence.\n\n1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:48.400\n Yeah, I know that Lockheed is involved in cyber,\n\n1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:50.940\n so I saw that you mentioned that.\n\n1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:57.080\n It's an incredibly, nuclear almost seems easier than cyber\n\n1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:58.840\n because there's so many attack,\n\n1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:01.720\n there's so many ways that cyber can evolve\n\n1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:03.440\n in such an uncertain future.\n\n1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:05.800\n But talking about engineering with a mission,\n\n1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:09.640\n I mean, in this case that you're engineering systems\n\n1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:12.780\n that basically save the world.\n\n1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:18.000\n Well, like I said, we're privileged to work\n\n1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000\n on some very challenging problems\n\n1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.320\n for very critical customers here in the US\n\n1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:25.140\n and with our allies abroad as well.\n\n1:04:25.140 --> 1:04:30.140\n Lockheed builds both military and nonmilitary systems.\n\n1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:32.940\n And perhaps the future of Lockheed\n\n1:04:32.940 --> 1:04:35.300\n may be more in nonmilitary applications\n\n1:04:35.300 --> 1:04:37.180\n if you talk about space and beyond.\n\n1:04:38.220 --> 1:04:41.420\n I say that as a preface to a difficult question.\n\n1:04:41.420 --> 1:04:46.180\n So President Eisenhower in 1961 in his farewell address\n\n1:04:46.180 --> 1:04:48.940\n talked about the military industrial complex\n\n1:04:48.940 --> 1:04:51.660\n and that it shouldn't grow beyond what is needed.\n\n1:04:51.660 --> 1:04:55.860\n So what are your thoughts on those words,\n\n1:04:55.860 --> 1:04:58.780\n on the military industrial complex,\n\n1:04:58.780 --> 1:05:03.780\n on the concern of growth of their developments\n\n1:05:04.100 --> 1:05:05.800\n beyond what may be needed?\n\n1:05:06.940 --> 1:05:11.940\n That where it may be needed is a critical phrase, of course.\n\n1:05:12.420 --> 1:05:15.020\n And I think it is worth pointing out, as you noted,\n\n1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:16.020\n that Lockheed Martin,\n\n1:05:16.020 --> 1:05:19.420\n we are in a number of commercial businesses\n\n1:05:19.420 --> 1:05:24.020\n from energy to space to commercial aircraft.\n\n1:05:24.020 --> 1:05:28.660\n And so I wouldn't neglect the importance\n\n1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:32.140\n of those parts of our business as well.\n\n1:05:32.140 --> 1:05:36.980\n I think the world is dynamic and there was a time,\n\n1:05:36.980 --> 1:05:38.900\n and it doesn't seem that long ago to me,\n\n1:05:38.900 --> 1:05:41.920\n it was while I was a graduate student here at MIT\n\n1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:43.980\n and we were talking about the peace dividend\n\n1:05:43.980 --> 1:05:45.780\n at the end of the Cold War.\n\n1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:49.260\n If you look at expenditure on military systems\n\n1:05:49.260 --> 1:05:51.380\n as a fraction of GDP,\n\n1:05:51.380 --> 1:05:55.660\n we're far below peak levels of the past.\n\n1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:59.180\n And to me, at least, it looks like a time\n\n1:05:59.180 --> 1:06:02.740\n where you're seeing global threats changing in a way\n\n1:06:02.740 --> 1:06:06.980\n that would warrant relevant investments\n\n1:06:06.980 --> 1:06:10.020\n in defensive capabilities.\n\n1:06:10.940 --> 1:06:12.180\n The other thing I'd note,\n\n1:06:14.020 --> 1:06:17.140\n for military and defensive systems,\n\n1:06:17.140 --> 1:06:21.500\n it's not quite a free market, right?\n\n1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:25.740\n We don't sell to people on the street.\n\n1:06:25.740 --> 1:06:29.500\n And that warrants a very close partnership\n\n1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:33.180\n between, I'd say, the customers and the people\n\n1:06:33.180 --> 1:06:38.180\n that design, build, and maintain these systems\n\n1:06:38.300 --> 1:06:42.020\n because of the very unique nature,\n\n1:06:42.020 --> 1:06:44.980\n the very difficult requirements,\n\n1:06:44.980 --> 1:06:49.420\n the very great importance on safety\n\n1:06:49.420 --> 1:06:54.420\n and on operating the way they're intended every time.\n\n1:06:54.580 --> 1:06:56.740\n And so that does create,\n\n1:06:56.740 --> 1:06:59.540\n and frankly, it's one of Lockheed Martin's great strengths\n\n1:06:59.540 --> 1:07:03.460\n is that we have this expertise built up over many years\n\n1:07:03.460 --> 1:07:05.400\n in partnership with our customers\n\n1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:08.220\n to be able to design and build these systems\n\n1:07:08.220 --> 1:07:11.560\n that meet these very unique mission needs.\n\n1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:14.380\n Yeah, because building those systems is very costly,\n\n1:07:14.380 --> 1:07:16.100\n there's very little room for mistake.\n\n1:07:16.100 --> 1:07:18.980\n I mean, it's, yeah, just Ben Rich's book and so on\n\n1:07:18.980 --> 1:07:20.300\n just tells the story.\n\n1:07:20.300 --> 1:07:22.340\n It's nerve wracking just reading it.\n\n1:07:22.340 --> 1:07:24.380\n If you're an engineer, it reads like a thriller.\n\n1:07:24.380 --> 1:07:29.380\n Okay, let me, let's go back to space for a second.\n\n1:07:29.380 --> 1:07:30.700\n I guess.\n\n1:07:30.700 --> 1:07:33.140\n I'm always happy to go back to space.\n\n1:07:33.140 --> 1:07:36.420\n So a few quick, maybe out there,\n\n1:07:36.420 --> 1:07:40.580\n maybe fun questions, maybe a little provocative.\n\n1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:43.680\n What are your thoughts on the efforts\n\n1:07:43.680 --> 1:07:48.680\n of the new folks, SpaceX and Elon Musk?\n\n1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:50.900\n What are your thoughts about what Elon is doing?\n\n1:07:50.900 --> 1:07:52.660\n Do you see him as competition?\n\n1:07:52.660 --> 1:07:54.200\n Do you enjoy competition?\n\n1:07:55.380 --> 1:07:56.220\n What are your thoughts?\n\n1:07:56.220 --> 1:08:00.060\n Yeah, first of all, certainly Elon,\n\n1:08:00.060 --> 1:08:03.220\n I'd say SpaceX and some of his other ventures\n\n1:08:03.220 --> 1:08:08.220\n are definitely a competitive force in the space industry.\n\n1:08:08.220 --> 1:08:09.900\n And do we like competition?\n\n1:08:09.900 --> 1:08:11.500\n Yeah, we do.\n\n1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:15.580\n And we think we're very strong competitors.\n\n1:08:15.580 --> 1:08:19.820\n I think it's, you know, competition is what the US\n\n1:08:19.820 --> 1:08:22.140\n is founded on in a lot of ways\n\n1:08:22.140 --> 1:08:24.700\n and always coming up with a better way.\n\n1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:27.540\n And I think it's really important\n\n1:08:27.540 --> 1:08:32.540\n to continue to have fresh eyes coming in, new innovation.\n\n1:08:33.020 --> 1:08:35.500\n I do think it's important to have level playing fields.\n\n1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:37.140\n And so you wanna make sure\n\n1:08:37.140 --> 1:08:41.260\n that you're not giving different requirements\n\n1:08:41.260 --> 1:08:42.860\n to different players.\n\n1:08:42.860 --> 1:08:45.580\n But, you know, I tell people, you know,\n\n1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:47.580\n I spent a lot of time at places like MIT.\n\n1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:50.640\n I'm gonna be at the MIT Beaverwork Summer Institute\n\n1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:52.140\n over the weekend here.\n\n1:08:52.140 --> 1:08:55.100\n And I tell people, this is the most exciting time\n\n1:08:55.100 --> 1:08:58.460\n to be in the space business in my entire life.\n\n1:08:58.460 --> 1:09:03.020\n And it is this explosion of new capabilities\n\n1:09:03.020 --> 1:09:06.080\n that have been driven by things like the, you know,\n\n1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:08.900\n the massive increase in computing power,\n\n1:09:08.900 --> 1:09:13.100\n things like the massive increase in comms capabilities,\n\n1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:15.180\n advanced and additive manufacturing\n\n1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:19.540\n are really bringing down the barriers to entry in this field\n\n1:09:19.540 --> 1:09:21.940\n and it's driving just incredible innovation.\n\n1:09:21.940 --> 1:09:23.080\n And it's happening at startups,\n\n1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:25.460\n but it's also happening at Lockheed Martin.\n\n1:09:25.460 --> 1:09:27.300\n You may not realize this, but Lockheed Martin,\n\n1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:29.900\n working with Stanford actually built the first CubeSat\n\n1:09:31.220 --> 1:09:33.660\n that was launched here out of the US\n\n1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:35.180\n that was called QuakeSat.\n\n1:09:35.180 --> 1:09:37.500\n And we did that with Stellar Solutions.\n\n1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:41.660\n This was right around just after 2000, I guess.\n\n1:09:41.660 --> 1:09:43.780\n And so we've been in that, you know,\n\n1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:45.580\n from the very beginning.\n\n1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:48.460\n And, you know, I talked about some of these,\n\n1:09:48.460 --> 1:09:50.180\n like, you know, Maya and Orion,\n\n1:09:50.180 --> 1:09:54.220\n but, you know, we're in the middle of what we call smartsats\n\n1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:55.860\n and software defined satellites\n\n1:09:55.860 --> 1:10:00.660\n that can essentially restructure and remap their purpose,\n\n1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:04.060\n their mission on orbit to give you almost, you know,\n\n1:10:04.060 --> 1:10:06.580\n unlimited flexibility for these satellites\n\n1:10:06.580 --> 1:10:08.060\n over their lifetimes.\n\n1:10:08.060 --> 1:10:10.280\n So those are just a couple of examples,\n\n1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:13.580\n but yeah, this is a great time to be in space.\n\n1:10:13.580 --> 1:10:14.420\n Absolutely.\n\n1:10:14.420 --> 1:10:19.420\n So Wright Brothers flew for the first time 116 years ago.\n\n1:10:20.220 --> 1:10:23.120\n So now we have supersonic stealth planes\n\n1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:25.480\n and all the technology we've talked about.\n\n1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:29.340\n What innovations, obviously you can't predict the future,\n\n1:10:29.340 --> 1:10:32.460\n but do you see Lockheed in the next 100 years?\n\n1:10:32.460 --> 1:10:34.160\n If you take that same leap,\n\n1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:37.840\n how will the world of technology and engineering change?\n\n1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:39.360\n I know it's an impossible question,\n\n1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:42.320\n but nobody could have predicted\n\n1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:45.800\n that we could even fly 120 years ago.\n\n1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:50.640\n So what do you think is the edge of possibility\n\n1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:52.680\n that we're going to be exploring in the next 100 years?\n\n1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:54.580\n I don't know that there is an edge.\n\n1:10:54.580 --> 1:10:56.120\n I, you know, we've been around\n\n1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:58.640\n for almost that entire time, right?\n\n1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:03.640\n The Lockheed brothers and Glen L. Martin\n\n1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:08.000\n starting their companies in the basement of a church\n\n1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.720\n and an old service station.\n\n1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:14.280\n We're very different companies today\n\n1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:15.740\n than we were back then, right?\n\n1:11:15.740 --> 1:11:19.080\n And that's because we've continuously reinvented ourselves\n\n1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:21.720\n over all of those decades.\n\n1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:24.360\n I think it's fair to say, I know this for sure,\n\n1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:27.880\n the world of the future, it's gonna move faster,\n\n1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:29.360\n it's gonna be more connected,\n\n1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:31.700\n it's gonna be more autonomous,\n\n1:11:31.700 --> 1:11:36.220\n and it's gonna be more complex than it is today.\n\n1:11:36.220 --> 1:11:38.360\n And so this is the world, you know,\n\n1:11:38.360 --> 1:11:40.600\n as a CTO at Lockheed Martin that I think about,\n\n1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.720\n what are the technologies that we have to invest in?\n\n1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:45.280\n Whether it's things like AI and autonomy,\n\n1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:47.320\n you know, you can think about quantum computing,\n\n1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:49.140\n which is an area that we've invested in\n\n1:11:49.140 --> 1:11:53.540\n to try to stay ahead of these technological changes,\n\n1:11:53.540 --> 1:11:56.320\n and frankly, some of the threats that are out there.\n\n1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:59.400\n I believe that we're gonna be out there in the solar system,\n\n1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:02.360\n that we're gonna be defending and defending well\n\n1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:04.960\n against probably, you know, military threats\n\n1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:07.180\n that nobody has even thought about today.\n\n1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:12.400\n We are going to be, we're gonna use these capabilities\n\n1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:15.720\n to have far greater knowledge of our own planet,\n\n1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:17.220\n the depths of the oceans, you know,\n\n1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:20.120\n all the way to the upper reaches of the atmosphere\n\n1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:21.400\n and everything out to the sun\n\n1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:23.440\n and to the edge of the solar system.\n\n1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:26.760\n So that's what I look forward to,\n\n1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:30.840\n and I'm excited, I mean, just looking ahead\n\n1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:33.360\n in the next decade or so to the steps\n\n1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:35.360\n that I see ahead of us in that time.\n\n1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:38.240\n I don't think there's a better place to end,\n\n1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:39.640\n Keoki, thank you so much.\n\n1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:41.100\n Lex, it's been a real pleasure,\n\n1:12:41.100 --> 1:12:43.440\n and sorry it took so long to get up here,\n\n1:12:43.440 --> 1:13:05.440\n but I'm glad we were able to make it happen.\n\n"
