00:10.320\n Cited over 245,000 times,\n\n00:10.320 --> 00:13.580\n known for many influential ideas in brain imaging,\n\n00:13.580 --> 00:16.520\n neuroscience, and theoretical neurobiology,\n\n00:16.520 --> 00:19.820\n including especially the fascinating idea\n\n00:19.820 --> 00:23.280\n of the free energy principle for action and perception.\n\n00:24.200 --> 00:28.040\n Carl's mix of humor, brilliance, and kindness,\n\n00:28.040 --> 00:31.160\n to me, are inspiring and captivating.\n\n00:31.160 --> 00:34.120\n This was a huge honor and a pleasure.\n\n00:34.120 --> 00:36.800\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:36.800 --> 00:38.920\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:38.920 --> 00:41.280\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n00:41.280 --> 00:42.560\n support it on Patreon,\n\n00:42.560 --> 00:44.560\n or simply connect with me on Twitter,\n\n00:44.560 --> 00:48.100\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n00:48.100 --> 00:50.480\n As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,\n\n00:50.480 --> 00:52.040\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n00:52.040 --> 00:54.220\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n00:54.220 --> 00:55.540\n I hope that works for you,\n\n00:55.540 --> 00:58.280\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n00:58.280 --> 01:00.880\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:00.880 --> 01:03.200\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:03.200 --> 01:06.280\n When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.\n\n01:06.280 --> 01:09.400\n Cash App lets you send money to friends by Bitcoin,\n\n01:09.400 --> 01:12.860\n and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.\n\n01:12.860 --> 01:14.480\n Since Cash App allows you to send\n\n01:14.480 --> 01:16.200\n and receive money digitally,\n\n01:16.200 --> 01:20.200\n let me mention a surprising fact related to physical money.\n\n01:20.200 --> 01:22.000\n Of all the currency in the world,\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:25.640\n roughly 8% of it is actual physical money.\n\n01:25.640 --> 01:29.920\n The other 92% of money only exists digitally.\n\n01:29.920 --> 01:32.260\n So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,\n\n01:32.260 --> 01:37.040\n Google Play, and use the code LEXPODCAST, you get $10,\n\n01:37.040 --> 01:39.880\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n01:39.880 --> 01:42.640\n an organization that is helping to advance robotics\n\n01:42.640 --> 01:45.780\n and STEM education for young people around the world.\n\n01:45.780 --> 01:50.020\n And now, here's my conversation with Carl Friston.\n\n01:50.020 --> 01:53.380\n How much of the human brain do we understand\n\n01:53.380 --> 01:56.580\n from the low level of neuronal communication\n\n01:56.580 --> 02:01.580\n to the functional level to the highest level,\n\n02:01.660 --> 02:04.940\n maybe the psychiatric disorder level?\n\n02:04.940 --> 02:06.420\n Well, we're certainly in a better position\n\n02:06.420 --> 02:08.080\n than we were last century.\n\n02:08.980 --> 02:10.440\n How far we've got to go, I think,\n\n02:10.440 --> 02:12.640\n is almost an unanswerable question.\n\n02:13.520 --> 02:16.040\n So you'd have to set the parameters,\n\n02:16.040 --> 02:20.140\n you know, what constitutes understanding, what level\n\n02:20.140 --> 02:21.740\n of understanding do you want?\n\n02:21.740 --> 02:25.380\n I think we've made enormous progress\n\n02:25.380 --> 02:27.820\n in terms of broad brush principles.\n\n02:29.140 --> 02:32.460\n Whether that affords a detailed cartography\n\n02:32.460 --> 02:35.380\n of the functional anatomy of the brain and what it does,\n\n02:35.380 --> 02:38.140\n right down to the microcircuitry and the neurons,\n\n02:38.140 --> 02:42.220\n that's probably out of reach at the present time.\n\n02:42.220 --> 02:44.900\n So the cartography, so mapping the brain,\n\n02:44.900 --> 02:47.440\n do you think mapping of the brain,\n\n02:47.440 --> 02:50.380\n the detailed, perfect imaging of it,\n\n02:50.380 --> 02:54.100\n does that get us closer to understanding\n\n02:54.100 --> 02:56.060\n of the mind, of the brain?\n\n02:56.060 --> 02:59.100\n So how far does it get us if we have\n\n02:59.100 --> 03:01.580\n that perfect cartography of the brain?\n\n03:01.580 --> 03:03.060\n I think there are lower bounds on that.\n\n03:03.060 --> 03:04.860\n It's a really interesting question.\n\n03:06.340 --> 03:09.220\n And it would determine the sort of scientific career\n\n03:09.220 --> 03:11.640\n you'd pursue if you believe that knowing\n\n03:11.640 --> 03:16.020\n every dendritic connection, every sort of microscopic,\n\n03:16.020 --> 03:18.740\n synaptic structure right down to the molecular level\n\n03:18.740 --> 03:22.260\n was gonna give you the right kind of information\n\n03:22.260 --> 03:25.340\n to understand the computational anatomy,\n\n03:25.340 --> 03:27.180\n then you'd choose to be a microscopist\n\n03:27.180 --> 03:32.180\n and you would study little cubic millimeters of brain\n\n03:32.340 --> 03:33.500\n for the rest of your life.\n\n03:33.500 --> 03:35.300\n If on the other hand you were interested\n\n03:35.300 --> 03:40.300\n in holistic functions and a sort of functional anatomy\n\n03:40.300 --> 03:44.100\n of the sort that a neuropsychologist would understand,\n\n03:44.100 --> 03:46.380\n you'd study brain lesions and strokes,\n\n03:46.380 --> 03:48.460\n just looking at the whole person.\n\n03:48.460 --> 03:50.900\n So again, it comes back to at what level\n\n03:50.900 --> 03:52.980\n do you want understanding?\n\n03:52.980 --> 03:56.140\n I think there are principled reasons not to go too far.\n\n03:57.900 --> 04:01.660\n If you commit to a view of the brain\n\n04:01.660 --> 04:06.660\n as a machine that's performing a form of inference\n\n04:06.660 --> 04:11.660\n and representing things, that level of understanding\n\n04:15.980 --> 04:20.540\n is necessarily cast in terms of probability densities\n\n04:20.540 --> 04:24.180\n and ensemble densities, distributions.\n\n04:24.180 --> 04:27.120\n And what that tells you is that you don't really want\n\n04:27.120 --> 04:30.500\n to look at the atoms to understand the thermodynamics\n\n04:30.500 --> 04:34.420\n of probabilistic descriptions of how the brain works.\n\n04:34.420 --> 04:38.620\n So I personally wouldn't look at the molecules\n\n04:38.620 --> 04:41.700\n or indeed the single neurons in the same way\n\n04:41.700 --> 04:44.060\n if I wanted to understand the thermodynamics\n\n04:44.060 --> 04:47.220\n of some non equilibrium steady state of a gas\n\n04:47.220 --> 04:49.980\n or an active material, I wouldn't spend my life\n\n04:49.980 --> 04:54.200\n looking at the individual molecules\n\n04:54.200 --> 04:55.420\n that constitute that ensemble.\n\n04:55.420 --> 04:57.500\n I'd look at their collective behavior.\n\n04:57.500 --> 05:00.140\n On the other hand, if you go too coarse grain,\n\n05:00.140 --> 05:03.900\n you're gonna miss some basic canonical principles\n\n05:03.900 --> 05:06.300\n of connectivity and architectures.\n\n05:06.300 --> 05:10.020\n I'm thinking here this bit colloquial,\n\n05:10.020 --> 05:13.540\n but this current excitement about high field\n\n05:13.540 --> 05:17.240\n magnetic resonance imaging at seven Tesla, why?\n\n05:17.240 --> 05:19.460\n Well, it gives us for the first time the opportunity\n\n05:19.460 --> 05:22.740\n to look at the brain in action at the level\n\n05:22.740 --> 05:24.700\n of a few millimeters that distinguish\n\n05:24.700 --> 05:27.260\n between different layers of the cortex\n\n05:27.260 --> 05:32.260\n that may be very important in terms of evincing\n\n05:32.260 --> 05:35.260\n generic principles of conical microcircuitry\n\n05:35.260 --> 05:37.620\n that are replicated throughout the brain\n\n05:37.620 --> 05:39.120\n that may tell us something fundamental\n\n05:39.120 --> 05:41.140\n about message passing in the brain\n\n05:41.140 --> 05:44.260\n and these density dynamics or neuronal\n\n05:44.260 --> 05:46.820\n or some more population dynamics\n\n05:46.820 --> 05:49.420\n that underwrite our brain function.\n\n05:49.420 --> 05:52.960\n So somewhere between a millimeter and a meter.\n\n05:53.920 --> 05:57.440\n Lingering for a bit on the big questions if you allow me,\n\n05:58.340 --> 06:01.940\n what to use the most beautiful or surprising characteristic\n\n06:01.940 --> 06:03.420\n of the human brain?\n\n06:03.420 --> 06:06.780\n I think it's hierarchical and recursive aspect.\n\n06:06.780 --> 06:08.680\n It's recurrent aspect.\n\n06:08.680 --> 06:10.820\n Of the structure or of the actual\n\n06:10.820 --> 06:12.920\n representation of power of the brain?\n\n06:12.920 --> 06:15.380\n Well, I think one speaks to the other.\n\n06:15.380 --> 06:18.420\n I was actually answering in a dull minded way\n\n06:18.420 --> 06:20.380\n from the point of view of purely its anatomy\n\n06:20.380 --> 06:22.980\n and its structural aspects.\n\n06:22.980 --> 06:26.740\n I mean, there are many marvelous organs in the body.\n\n06:26.740 --> 06:28.460\n Let's take your liver for example.\n\n06:28.460 --> 06:32.660\n Without it, you wouldn't be around for very long\n\n06:32.660 --> 06:35.980\n and it does some beautiful and delicate biochemistry\n\n06:35.980 --> 06:40.980\n and homeostasis and evolved with a finesse\n\n06:41.140 --> 06:43.020\n that would easily parallel the brain\n\n06:43.020 --> 06:45.140\n but it doesn't have a beautiful anatomy.\n\n06:45.140 --> 06:47.020\n It has a simple anatomy which is attractive\n\n06:47.020 --> 06:48.940\n in a minimalist sense but it doesn't have\n\n06:48.940 --> 06:52.820\n that crafted structure of sparse connectivity\n\n06:52.820 --> 06:55.380\n and that recurrence and that specialization\n\n06:55.380 --> 06:56.380\n that the brain has.\n\n06:56.380 --> 06:58.300\n So you said a lot of interesting terms here.\n\n06:58.300 --> 07:00.700\n So the recurrence, the sparsity,\n\n07:00.700 --> 07:03.540\n but you also started by saying hierarchical.\n\n07:03.540 --> 07:08.540\n So I've never thought of our brain as hierarchical.\n\n07:11.260 --> 07:14.300\n Sort of I always thought it's just like a giant mess,\n\n07:14.300 --> 07:16.740\n interconnected mess where it's very difficult\n\n07:16.740 --> 07:18.180\n to figure anything out.\n\n07:18.180 --> 07:21.860\n But in what sense do you see the brain as hierarchical?\n\n07:21.860 --> 07:24.220\n Well, I see it, it's not a magic soup.\n\n07:24.220 --> 07:28.700\n Which of course is what I used to think\n\n07:28.700 --> 07:33.380\n before I studied medicine and the like.\n\n07:34.460 --> 07:38.740\n So a lot of those terms imply each other.\n\n07:38.740 --> 07:41.700\n So hierarchies, if you just think about\n\n07:41.700 --> 07:43.540\n the nature of a hierarchy,\n\n07:43.540 --> 07:46.020\n how would you actually build one?\n\n07:46.020 --> 07:48.300\n And what you would have to do is basically\n\n07:48.300 --> 07:51.140\n carefully remove the right connections\n\n07:51.140 --> 07:54.740\n that destroy the completely connected soups\n\n07:54.740 --> 07:56.100\n that you might have in mind.\n\n07:56.100 --> 08:00.140\n So a hierarchy is in and of itself defined\n\n08:00.140 --> 08:03.180\n by a sparse and particular connectivity structure.\n\n08:04.420 --> 08:07.500\n I'm not committing to any particular form of hierarchy.\n\n08:08.380 --> 08:10.140\n But your sense is there is some.\n\n08:10.140 --> 08:11.420\n Oh, absolutely, yeah.\n\n08:11.420 --> 08:14.220\n In virtue of the fact that there is a sparsity\n\n08:14.220 --> 08:19.220\n of connectivity, not necessarily of a qualitative sort,\n\n08:19.220 --> 08:20.460\n but certainly of a quantitative sort.\n\n08:20.460 --> 08:25.460\n So it is demonstrably so that the further apart\n\n08:27.460 --> 08:29.220\n two parts of the brain are,\n\n08:29.220 --> 08:32.260\n the less likely they are to be wired,\n\n08:32.260 --> 08:35.820\n to possess axonal processes, neuronal processes\n\n08:35.820 --> 08:39.100\n that directly communicate one message\n\n08:39.100 --> 08:41.140\n or messages from one part of that brain\n\n08:41.140 --> 08:42.660\n to the other part of the brain.\n\n08:42.660 --> 08:44.780\n So we know there's a sparse connectivity.\n\n08:45.820 --> 08:50.300\n And furthermore, on the basis of anatomical connectivity\n\n08:50.300 --> 08:55.300\n in traces studies, we know that that sparsity\n\n08:57.580 --> 09:00.980\n underwrites a hierarchical and very structured\n\n09:00.980 --> 09:05.980\n sort of connectivity that might be best understood\n\n09:07.140 --> 09:09.380\n like a little bit like an onion.\n\n09:09.380 --> 09:14.380\n There is a concentric, sometimes referred to as centripetal\n\n09:15.540 --> 09:17.500\n by people like Marcel Masulam,\n\n09:17.500 --> 09:19.340\n hierarchical organization to the brain.\n\n09:19.340 --> 09:23.860\n So you can think of the brain as in a rough sense,\n\n09:23.860 --> 09:28.060\n like an onion, and all the sensory information\n\n09:28.060 --> 09:31.260\n and all the afferent outgoing messages\n\n09:31.260 --> 09:33.500\n that supply commands to your muscles\n\n09:33.500 --> 09:37.100\n or to your secretory organs come from the surface.\n\n09:37.100 --> 09:40.140\n So there's a massive exchange interface\n\n09:40.140 --> 09:43.020\n with the world out there on the surface.\n\n09:43.020 --> 09:45.140\n And then underneath, there's a little layer\n\n09:45.140 --> 09:49.380\n that sits and looks at the exchange on the surface.\n\n09:49.380 --> 09:51.380\n And then underneath that, there's a layer\n\n09:51.380 --> 09:53.380\n right the way down to the very center,\n\n09:53.380 --> 09:55.740\n to the deepest part of the onion.\n\n09:55.740 --> 09:58.700\n That's what I mean by a hierarchical organization.\n\n09:58.700 --> 10:02.020\n There's a discernible structure defined\n\n10:02.020 --> 10:04.860\n by the sparsity of connections\n\n10:04.860 --> 10:08.620\n that lends the architecture a hierarchical structure\n\n10:08.620 --> 10:12.780\n that tells one a lot about the kinds of representations\n\n10:12.780 --> 10:13.620\n and messages.\n\n10:13.620 --> 10:15.620\n Coming back to your earlier question,\n\n10:15.620 --> 10:18.260\n is this about the representational capacity\n\n10:19.140 --> 10:20.420\n or is it about the anatomy?\n\n10:20.420 --> 10:23.460\n Well, one underwrites the other.\n\n10:24.580 --> 10:26.380\n If one simply thinks of the brain\n\n10:26.380 --> 10:29.100\n as a message passing machine,\n\n10:29.100 --> 10:32.580\n a process that is in the service of doing something,\n\n10:33.460 --> 10:37.500\n then the circuitry and the connectivity\n\n10:37.500 --> 10:42.500\n that shape that message passing also dictate its function.\n\n10:42.500 --> 10:44.980\n So you've done a lot of amazing work\n\n10:44.980 --> 10:46.660\n in a lot of directions.\n\n10:46.660 --> 10:49.260\n So let's look at one aspect of that,\n\n10:49.260 --> 10:51.060\n of looking into the brain\n\n10:51.060 --> 10:53.300\n and trying to study this onion structure.\n\n10:54.980 --> 10:57.660\n What can we learn about the brain by imaging it?\n\n10:57.660 --> 11:00.860\n Which is one way to sort of look at the anatomy of it.\n\n11:00.860 --> 11:04.700\n Broadly speaking, what are the methods of imaging,\n\n11:04.700 --> 11:07.620\n but even bigger, what can we learn about it?\n\n11:07.620 --> 11:12.620\n Right, so well, most human neuroimaging\n\n11:13.820 --> 11:17.540\n that you might see in science journals\n\n11:18.980 --> 11:22.540\n that speaks to the way the brain works,\n\n11:22.540 --> 11:24.340\n measures brain activity over time.\n\n11:24.340 --> 11:26.020\n So that's the first thing to say,\n\n11:26.020 --> 11:30.020\n that we're effectively looking at fluctuations\n\n11:30.020 --> 11:32.580\n in neuronal responses,\n\n11:32.580 --> 11:36.140\n usually in response to some sensory input\n\n11:36.140 --> 11:40.660\n or some instruction, some task.\n\n11:40.660 --> 11:42.260\n Not necessarily, there's a lot of interest\n\n11:42.260 --> 11:43.620\n in just looking at the brain\n\n11:44.740 --> 11:46.860\n in terms of resting state, endogenous,\n\n11:46.860 --> 11:48.940\n or intrinsic activity.\n\n11:48.940 --> 11:50.780\n But crucially, at every point,\n\n11:50.780 --> 11:52.460\n looking at these fluctuations,\n\n11:52.460 --> 11:56.380\n either induced or intrinsic in the neural activity,\n\n11:57.340 --> 11:59.020\n and understanding them at two levels.\n\n11:59.020 --> 12:03.540\n So normally, people would recourse\n\n12:03.540 --> 12:06.260\n to two principles of brain organization\n\n12:06.260 --> 12:07.420\n that are complementary.\n\n12:07.420 --> 12:10.460\n One, functional specialization or segregation.\n\n12:10.460 --> 12:11.860\n So what does that mean?\n\n12:11.860 --> 12:16.300\n It simply means that there are certain parts of the brain\n\n12:16.300 --> 12:19.580\n that may be specialized for certain kinds of processing.\n\n12:19.580 --> 12:21.900\n For example, visual motion,\n\n12:21.900 --> 12:26.060\n our ability to recognize or to perceive movement\n\n12:26.060 --> 12:27.780\n in the visual world.\n\n12:27.780 --> 12:31.100\n And furthermore, that specialized processing\n\n12:31.100 --> 12:34.540\n may be spatially or anatomically segregated,\n\n12:34.540 --> 12:37.060\n leading to functional segregation.\n\n12:37.060 --> 12:40.900\n Which means that if I were to compare your brain activity\n\n12:40.900 --> 12:45.220\n during a period of viewing a static image,\n\n12:45.220 --> 12:49.260\n and then compare that to the responses of fluctuations\n\n12:49.260 --> 12:52.660\n in the brain when you were exposed to a moving image,\n\n12:52.660 --> 12:54.900\n say a flying bird,\n\n12:54.900 --> 12:56.300\n we'd expect to see\n\n12:56.300 --> 13:01.620\n restricted, segregated differences in activity.\n\n13:01.620 --> 13:03.780\n And those are basically the hotspots\n\n13:03.780 --> 13:06.780\n that you see in the statistical parametric maps\n\n13:06.780 --> 13:08.900\n that test for the significance of the responses\n\n13:08.900 --> 13:11.060\n that are circumscribed.\n\n13:11.060 --> 13:13.740\n So now, basically, we're talking about\n\n13:13.740 --> 13:19.300\n some people have perhaps unkindly called a neocartography.\n\n13:19.300 --> 13:24.420\n This is a phrenology augmented by modern day neuroimaging,\n\n13:24.420 --> 13:28.980\n basically finding blobs or bumps on the brain\n\n13:28.980 --> 13:30.860\n that do this or do that,\n\n13:30.860 --> 13:33.100\n and trying to understand the cartography\n\n13:33.100 --> 13:35.700\n of that functional specialization.\n\n13:35.700 --> 13:38.860\n So how much is there such,\n\n13:38.860 --> 13:43.220\n this is such a beautiful sort of ideal to strive for.\n\n13:43.220 --> 13:46.860\n We humans, scientists, would like this,\n\n13:46.860 --> 13:48.980\n to hope that there's a beautiful structure to this\n\n13:48.980 --> 13:51.420\n where it's, like you said, there's segregated regions\n\n13:51.420 --> 13:54.100\n that are responsible for the different function.\n\n13:54.100 --> 13:57.100\n How much hope is there to find such regions\n\n13:57.100 --> 14:00.420\n in terms of looking at the progress of studying the brain?\n\n14:00.420 --> 14:02.740\n Oh, I think enormous progress has been made\n\n14:02.740 --> 14:04.860\n in the past 20 or 30 years.\n\n14:06.860 --> 14:08.940\n So this is beyond incremental.\n\n14:08.940 --> 14:11.940\n At the advent of brain imaging,\n\n14:11.940 --> 14:14.820\n the very notion of functional segregation\n\n14:14.820 --> 14:18.900\n was just a hypothesis based upon a century,\n\n14:18.900 --> 14:21.420\n if not more, of careful neuropsychology,\n\n14:21.420 --> 14:24.660\n looking at people who had lost via insult\n\n14:24.660 --> 14:29.300\n or traumatic brain injury particular parts of the brain,\n\n14:29.300 --> 14:30.780\n and then saying, well, they can't do this\n\n14:30.780 --> 14:32.060\n or they can't do that.\n\n14:32.060 --> 14:34.100\n For example, losing the visual cortex\n\n14:34.100 --> 14:35.620\n and not being able to see,\n\n14:35.620 --> 14:39.580\n or losing particular parts of the visual cortex\n\n14:39.580 --> 14:44.060\n or regions known as V5\n\n14:44.060 --> 14:47.980\n or the middle temporal region, MT,\n\n14:47.980 --> 14:49.580\n and noticing that they selectively\n\n14:49.580 --> 14:51.460\n could not see moving things.\n\n14:51.460 --> 14:55.140\n And so that created the hypothesis\n\n14:55.140 --> 14:59.700\n that perhaps visual movement processing\n\n14:59.700 --> 15:02.740\n was located in this functionally segregated area.\n\n15:02.740 --> 15:05.700\n And you could then go and put invasive electrodes\n\n15:05.700 --> 15:08.260\n in animal models and say, yes, indeed,\n\n15:08.260 --> 15:10.500\n we can excite activity here.\n\n15:10.500 --> 15:13.980\n We can form receptive fields that are sensitive to\n\n15:13.980 --> 15:16.220\n or defined in terms of visual motion.\n\n15:16.220 --> 15:18.340\n But at no point could you exclude the possibility\n\n15:18.340 --> 15:20.020\n that everywhere else in the brain\n\n15:20.020 --> 15:23.140\n was also very interested in visual motion.\n\n15:23.140 --> 15:24.900\n By the way, I apologize to interrupt,\n\n15:24.900 --> 15:26.980\n but a tiny little tangent.\n\n15:26.980 --> 15:31.180\n You said animal models, just out of curiosity,\n\n15:31.180 --> 15:34.460\n from your perspective, how different is the human brain\n\n15:34.460 --> 15:35.460\n versus the other animals\n\n15:35.460 --> 15:38.980\n in terms of our ability to study the brain?\n\n15:38.980 --> 15:43.620\n Well, clearly, the further away you go from a human brain,\n\n15:43.620 --> 15:45.740\n the greater the differences,\n\n15:45.740 --> 15:48.940\n but not as remarkable as you might think.\n\n15:48.940 --> 15:53.180\n So people will choose their level of approximation\n\n15:53.180 --> 15:54.300\n to the human brain,\n\n15:54.300 --> 15:56.540\n depending upon the kinds of questions\n\n15:56.540 --> 15:57.380\n that they want to answer.\n\n15:57.380 --> 16:00.620\n So if you're talking about sort of canonical principles\n\n16:00.620 --> 16:02.780\n of microcircuitry, it might be perfectly okay\n\n16:02.780 --> 16:04.540\n to look at a mouse, indeed.\n\n16:04.540 --> 16:07.220\n You could even look at flies, worms.\n\n16:08.100 --> 16:09.740\n If, on the other hand, you wanted to look at\n\n16:09.740 --> 16:13.100\n the finer details of organization of visual cortex\n\n16:13.100 --> 16:17.420\n and V1, V2, these are designated patches of cortex\n\n16:17.420 --> 16:20.660\n that may do different things, indeed, do.\n\n16:20.660 --> 16:23.340\n You'd probably want to use a primate\n\n16:23.340 --> 16:25.980\n that looked a little bit more like a human,\n\n16:26.940 --> 16:28.260\n because there are lots of ethical issues\n\n16:28.260 --> 16:32.780\n in terms of the use of nonhuman primates\n\n16:32.780 --> 16:37.500\n to answer questions about human anatomy.\n\n16:37.500 --> 16:39.060\n But I think most people assume\n\n16:39.060 --> 16:43.300\n that most of the important principles are conserved\n\n16:43.300 --> 16:48.020\n in a continuous way, right from, well, yes,\n\n16:48.020 --> 16:53.020\n worms right through to you and me.\n\n16:53.260 --> 16:56.900\n So now returning to, so that was the early sort of ideas\n\n16:56.900 --> 17:00.820\n of studying the functional regions of the brain\n\n17:00.820 --> 17:02.860\n by if there's some damage to it,\n\n17:02.860 --> 17:06.140\n to try to infer that that part of the brain\n\n17:06.140 --> 17:09.100\n might be somewhat responsible for this type of function.\n\n17:09.100 --> 17:11.140\n So where does that lead us?\n\n17:11.140 --> 17:12.980\n What are the next steps beyond that?\n\n17:12.980 --> 17:16.140\n Right, well, I'll just actually just reverse a bit,\n\n17:16.140 --> 17:17.860\n come back to your sort of notion\n\n17:17.860 --> 17:19.580\n that the brain is a magic soup.\n\n17:19.580 --> 17:22.580\n That was actually a very prominent idea at one point,\n\n17:23.780 --> 17:27.140\n notions such as Lashley's law of mass action\n\n17:28.140 --> 17:33.140\n inherited from the observation that for certain animals,\n\n17:33.140 --> 17:36.020\n if you just took out spoonfuls of the brain,\n\n17:36.020 --> 17:38.220\n it didn't matter where you took these spoonfuls out,\n\n17:38.220 --> 17:40.420\n they always showed the same kinds of deficits.\n\n17:40.420 --> 17:44.540\n So it was very difficult to infer functional specialization\n\n17:44.540 --> 17:48.300\n purely on the basis of lesion deficit studies.\n\n17:49.260 --> 17:50.820\n But once we had the opportunity\n\n17:50.820 --> 17:52.380\n to look at the brain lighting up\n\n17:52.380 --> 17:57.740\n and it's literally it's sort of excitement, neuronal excitement\n\n17:57.740 --> 18:01.100\n when looking at this versus that,\n\n18:01.100 --> 18:03.260\n one was able to say, yes, indeed,\n\n18:03.260 --> 18:05.020\n these functionally specialized responses\n\n18:05.020 --> 18:08.780\n are very restricted and they're here or they're over there.\n\n18:08.780 --> 18:11.340\n If I do this, then this part of the brain lights up.\n\n18:11.340 --> 18:16.340\n And that became doable in the early 90s.\n\n18:16.900 --> 18:19.100\n In fact, shortly before with the advent\n\n18:19.100 --> 18:21.060\n of positron emission tomography.\n\n18:21.060 --> 18:23.420\n And then functional magnetic resonance imaging\n\n18:23.420 --> 18:26.700\n came along in the early 90s.\n\n18:26.700 --> 18:29.780\n And since that time, there has been an explosion\n\n18:29.780 --> 18:34.780\n of discovery, refinement, confirmation.\n\n18:36.300 --> 18:38.940\n There are people who believe that it's all in the anatomy.\n\n18:38.940 --> 18:40.260\n If you understand the anatomy,\n\n18:40.260 --> 18:43.260\n then you understand the function at some level.\n\n18:43.260 --> 18:45.780\n And many, many hypotheses were predicated\n\n18:45.780 --> 18:49.980\n on a deep understanding of the anatomy and the connectivity,\n\n18:49.980 --> 18:51.260\n but they were all confirmed\n\n18:51.260 --> 18:55.140\n and taken much further with neuroimaging.\n\n18:55.140 --> 18:57.580\n So that's what I meant by we've made an enormous amount\n\n18:57.580 --> 19:01.180\n of progress in this century indeed,\n\n19:01.180 --> 19:03.940\n and in relation to the previous century,\n\n19:03.940 --> 19:08.940\n by looking at these functionally selective responses.\n\n19:09.620 --> 19:11.100\n But that wasn't the whole story.\n\n19:11.100 --> 19:13.580\n So there's this sort of near phrenology,\n\n19:13.580 --> 19:15.620\n but finding bumps and hot spots in the brain\n\n19:15.620 --> 19:16.700\n that did this or that.\n\n19:17.620 --> 19:20.020\n The bigger question was, of course,\n\n19:20.020 --> 19:22.140\n the functional integration.\n\n19:22.140 --> 19:26.980\n How all of these regionally specific responses\n\n19:26.980 --> 19:29.860\n were orchestrated, how they were distributed,\n\n19:29.860 --> 19:32.700\n how did they relate to distributed processing\n\n19:32.700 --> 19:35.580\n and indeed representations in the brain.\n\n19:35.580 --> 19:39.540\n So then you turn to the more challenging issue\n\n19:39.540 --> 19:42.660\n of the integration, the connectivity.\n\n19:42.660 --> 19:44.980\n And then we come back to this beautiful,\n\n19:44.980 --> 19:49.060\n sparse, recurrent, hierarchical connectivity\n\n19:49.060 --> 19:51.140\n that seems characteristic of the brain\n\n19:51.140 --> 19:53.620\n and probably not many other organs.\n\n19:53.620 --> 19:58.260\n But nevertheless, we come back to this challenge\n\n19:58.260 --> 20:01.100\n of trying to figure out how everything is integrated.\n\n20:01.100 --> 20:02.820\n But what's your feeling?\n\n20:02.820 --> 20:04.220\n What's the general consensus?\n\n20:04.220 --> 20:07.820\n Have we moved away from the magic soup view of the brain?\n\n20:07.820 --> 20:10.620\n So there is a deep structure to it.\n\n20:11.940 --> 20:14.460\n And then maybe a further question.\n\n20:14.460 --> 20:16.820\n You said some people believe that the structure\n\n20:16.820 --> 20:19.180\n is most of it, that you can really get\n\n20:19.180 --> 20:20.220\n at the core of the function\n\n20:20.220 --> 20:22.540\n by just deeply understanding the structure.\n\n20:22.540 --> 20:25.180\n Where do you sit on that, do you?\n\n20:25.180 --> 20:28.260\n I think it's got some mileage to it, yes, yeah.\n\n20:28.260 --> 20:30.300\n So it's a worthy pursuit of going,\n\n20:31.180 --> 20:34.780\n of studying through imaging and all the different methods\n\n20:34.780 --> 20:36.260\n to actually study the structure.\n\n20:36.260 --> 20:38.340\n No, absolutely, yeah, yeah.\n\n20:38.340 --> 20:41.180\n Sorry, I'm just noting, you were accusing me\n\n20:41.180 --> 20:42.460\n of using lots of long words\n\n20:42.460 --> 20:44.300\n and then you introduced one there, which is deep,\n\n20:44.300 --> 20:45.380\n which is interesting.\n\n20:46.340 --> 20:50.420\n Because deep is the sort of millennial equivalent\n\n20:50.420 --> 20:51.660\n of hierarchical.\n\n20:51.660 --> 20:53.860\n So if you've put deep in front of anything,\n\n20:53.860 --> 20:57.620\n not only are you very millennial and very trending,\n\n20:57.620 --> 21:01.540\n but you're also implying a hierarchical architecture.\n\n21:01.540 --> 21:05.260\n So it is a depth, which is, for me, the beautiful thing.\n\n21:05.260 --> 21:07.380\n That's right, the word deep kind of,\n\n21:07.380 --> 21:10.260\n yeah, exactly, it implies hierarchy.\n\n21:10.260 --> 21:11.500\n I didn't even think about that.\n\n21:11.500 --> 21:14.620\n That indeed, the implicit meaning\n\n21:14.620 --> 21:16.820\n of the word deep is hierarchy.\n\n21:16.820 --> 21:18.340\n Yep. Yeah.\n\n21:18.340 --> 21:22.380\n So deep inside the onion is the center of your soul.\n\n21:22.380 --> 21:23.500\n Beautifully put.\n\n21:23.500 --> 21:26.780\n Maybe briefly, if you could paint a picture\n\n21:26.780 --> 21:30.980\n of the kind of methods of neuroimaging,\n\n21:30.980 --> 21:33.420\n maybe the history which you were a part of,\n\n21:33.420 --> 21:35.180\n from statistical parametric mapping.\n\n21:35.180 --> 21:37.940\n I mean, just what's out there that's interesting\n\n21:37.940 --> 21:40.540\n for people maybe outside the field\n\n21:40.540 --> 21:43.460\n to understand of what are the actual methodologies\n\n21:43.460 --> 21:45.340\n of looking inside the human brain?\n\n21:45.340 --> 21:47.420\n Right, well, you can answer that question\n\n21:47.420 --> 21:48.300\n from two perspectives.\n\n21:48.300 --> 21:49.900\n Basically, it's the modality.\n\n21:49.900 --> 21:52.580\n What kind of signal are you measuring?\n\n21:52.580 --> 21:55.460\n And they can range from,\n\n21:55.460 --> 21:56.860\n and let's limit ourselves\n\n21:56.860 --> 22:01.060\n to sort of imaging based noninvasive techniques.\n\n22:01.060 --> 22:03.020\n So you've essentially got brain scanners,\n\n22:03.020 --> 22:05.340\n and brain scanners can either measure\n\n22:05.340 --> 22:07.660\n the structural attributes, the amount of water,\n\n22:07.660 --> 22:09.300\n the amount of fat, or the amount of iron\n\n22:09.300 --> 22:10.380\n in different parts of the brain,\n\n22:10.380 --> 22:11.620\n and you can make lots of inferences\n\n22:11.620 --> 22:15.460\n about the structure of the organ of the sort\n\n22:15.460 --> 22:17.780\n that you might have produced from an X ray,\n\n22:17.780 --> 22:21.340\n but a very nuanced X ray that is looking\n\n22:21.340 --> 22:24.380\n at this kind of property or that kind of property.\n\n22:24.380 --> 22:27.860\n So looking at the anatomy noninvasively\n\n22:27.860 --> 22:30.140\n would be the first sort of neuroimaging\n\n22:30.140 --> 22:32.180\n that people might want to employ.\n\n22:32.180 --> 22:34.940\n Then you move on to the kinds of measurements\n\n22:34.940 --> 22:38.100\n that reflect dynamic function,\n\n22:38.100 --> 22:42.020\n and the most prevalent of those fall into two camps.\n\n22:42.020 --> 22:46.460\n You've got these metabolic, sometimes hemodynamic,\n\n22:46.460 --> 22:48.940\n blood related signals.\n\n22:48.940 --> 22:53.460\n So these metabolic and or hemodynamic signals\n\n22:53.460 --> 22:58.380\n are basically proxies for elevated activity\n\n22:58.380 --> 23:03.380\n and message passing and neuronal dynamics\n\n23:03.460 --> 23:05.340\n in particular parts of the brain.\n\n23:05.340 --> 23:07.660\n Characteristically though, the time constants\n\n23:07.660 --> 23:11.420\n of these hemodynamic or metabolic responses\n\n23:11.420 --> 23:14.300\n to neural activity are much longer\n\n23:14.300 --> 23:15.820\n than the neural activity itself.\n\n23:15.820 --> 23:18.020\n And this is referring,\n\n23:19.020 --> 23:20.580\n forgive me for the dumb questions,\n\n23:20.580 --> 23:22.940\n but this would be referring to blood,\n\n23:22.940 --> 23:24.260\n like the flow of blood.\n\n23:24.260 --> 23:25.100\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n23:25.100 --> 23:26.500\n So there's a ton of,\n\n23:26.500 --> 23:29.420\n it seems like there's a ton of blood vessels in the brain.\n\n23:29.420 --> 23:30.260\n Yeah.\n\n23:30.260 --> 23:33.700\n So what's the interaction between the flow of blood\n\n23:33.700 --> 23:35.980\n and the function of the neurons?\n\n23:35.980 --> 23:37.420\n Is there an interplay there or?\n\n23:37.420 --> 23:42.420\n Yup, yup, and that interplay accounts for several careers\n\n23:42.780 --> 23:46.180\n of world renowned scientists, yes, absolutely.\n\n23:47.220 --> 23:49.140\n So this is known as neurovascular coupling,\n\n23:49.140 --> 23:50.180\n is exactly what you said.\n\n23:50.180 --> 23:52.300\n It's how does the neural activity,\n\n23:52.300 --> 23:54.620\n the neuronal infrastructure, the actual message passing\n\n23:54.620 --> 23:59.620\n that we think underlies our capacity to perceive and act,\n\n24:01.060 --> 24:06.060\n how is that coupled to the vascular responses\n\n24:06.060 --> 24:09.900\n that supply the energy for that neural processing?\n\n24:09.900 --> 24:13.380\n So there's a delicate web of large vessels,\n\n24:13.380 --> 24:16.420\n arteries and veins, that gets progressively finer\n\n24:16.420 --> 24:18.860\n and finer in detail until it perfuses\n\n24:18.860 --> 24:20.420\n at a microscopic level,\n\n24:20.420 --> 24:23.780\n the machinery where little neurons lie.\n\n24:23.780 --> 24:26.520\n So coming back to this sort of onion perspective,\n\n24:27.420 --> 24:30.500\n we were talking before using the onion as a metaphor\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:32.460\n for a deep hierarchical structure,\n\n24:32.460 --> 24:36.220\n but also I think it's just anatomically quite\n\n24:36.220 --> 24:37.780\n a useful metaphor.\n\n24:37.780 --> 24:40.140\n All the action, all the heavy lifting\n\n24:40.140 --> 24:41.660\n in terms of neural computation is done\n\n24:41.660 --> 24:43.940\n on the surface of the brain,\n\n24:43.940 --> 24:47.380\n and then the interior of the brain is constituted\n\n24:47.380 --> 24:52.380\n by fatty wires, essentially, axonal processes\n\n24:52.980 --> 24:55.940\n that are enshrouded by myelin sheaths.\n\n24:55.940 --> 24:59.620\n And these, when you dissect them, they look fatty and white,\n\n24:59.620 --> 25:01.240\n and so it's called white matter,\n\n25:01.240 --> 25:04.100\n as opposed to the actual neuro pill,\n\n25:04.100 --> 25:07.220\n which does the computation constituted largely by neurons,\n\n25:07.220 --> 25:08.700\n and that's known as gray matter.\n\n25:08.700 --> 25:13.260\n So the gray matter is a surface or a skin\n\n25:13.260 --> 25:16.260\n that sits on top of this big ball,\n\n25:16.260 --> 25:17.780\n now we are talking magic soup,\n\n25:17.780 --> 25:20.860\n but a big ball of connections like spaghetti,\n\n25:20.860 --> 25:23.100\n very carefully structured with sparse connectivity\n\n25:23.100 --> 25:25.760\n that preserves this deep hierarchical structure,\n\n25:25.760 --> 25:28.300\n but all the action takes place on the surface,\n\n25:28.300 --> 25:33.300\n on the cortex of the onion, and that means\n\n25:34.180 --> 25:38.560\n that you have to supply the right amount of blood flow,\n\n25:38.560 --> 25:41.100\n the right amount of nutrient,\n\n25:41.100 --> 25:45.240\n which is rapidly absorbed and used by neural cells\n\n25:45.240 --> 25:46.820\n that don't have the same capacity\n\n25:46.820 --> 25:48.780\n that your leg muscles would have\n\n25:48.780 --> 25:52.500\n to basically spend their energy budget\n\n25:52.500 --> 25:55.000\n and then claim it back later.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.420\n So one peculiar thing about cerebral metabolism,\n\n25:58.420 --> 26:01.440\n brain metabolism, is it really needs to be driven\n\n26:01.440 --> 26:03.060\n in the moment, which means you basically\n\n26:03.060 --> 26:04.860\n have to turn on the taps.\n\n26:04.860 --> 26:08.700\n So if there's lots of neural activity\n\n26:08.700 --> 26:10.780\n in one part of the brain, a little patch\n\n26:10.780 --> 26:14.100\n of a few millimeters, even less possibly,\n\n26:14.100 --> 26:16.060\n you really do have to water that piece\n\n26:16.060 --> 26:18.420\n of the garden now and quickly,\n\n26:18.420 --> 26:21.540\n and by quickly I mean within a couple of seconds.\n\n26:21.540 --> 26:26.060\n So that contains a lot of, hence the imaging\n\n26:26.060 --> 26:28.260\n could tell you a story of what's happening.\n\n26:28.260 --> 26:32.240\n Absolutely, but it is slightly compromised\n\n26:32.240 --> 26:33.460\n in terms of the resolution.\n\n26:33.460 --> 26:37.580\n So the deployment of these little microvessels\n\n26:37.580 --> 26:42.380\n that water the garden to enable the neural activity\n\n26:42.380 --> 26:45.320\n to play out, the spatial resolution\n\n26:45.320 --> 26:48.020\n is in order of a few millimeters,\n\n26:48.020 --> 26:50.380\n and crucially, the temporal resolution\n\n26:50.380 --> 26:52.220\n is the order of a few seconds.\n\n26:52.220 --> 26:54.420\n So you can't get right down and dirty\n\n26:54.420 --> 26:57.400\n into the actual spatial and temporal scale\n\n26:57.400 --> 26:59.920\n of neural activity in and of itself.\n\n26:59.920 --> 27:00.860\n To do that, you'd have to turn\n\n27:00.860 --> 27:02.580\n to the other big imaging modality,\n\n27:02.580 --> 27:05.580\n which is the recording of electromagnetic signals\n\n27:05.580 --> 27:07.740\n as they're generated in real time.\n\n27:07.740 --> 27:10.320\n So here, the temporal bandwidth, if you like,\n\n27:10.320 --> 27:12.960\n or the low limit on the temporal resolution\n\n27:12.960 --> 27:17.960\n is incredibly small, talking about milliseconds.\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:22.960\n And then you can get into the phasic fast responses\n\n27:23.520 --> 27:27.440\n that is in and of itself the neural activity,\n\n27:27.440 --> 27:32.440\n and start to see the succession or cascade\n\n27:32.780 --> 27:35.220\n of hierarchical recurrent message passing\n\n27:35.220 --> 27:37.140\n evoked by a particular stimulus.\n\n27:37.140 --> 27:39.400\n But the problem is you're looking\n\n27:39.400 --> 27:42.440\n at electromagnetic signals that have passed\n\n27:42.440 --> 27:45.640\n through an enormous amount of magic soup\n\n27:45.640 --> 27:49.480\n or spaghetti of collectivity, and through the scalp\n\n27:49.480 --> 27:52.920\n and the skull, and it's become spatially very diffuse.\n\n27:52.920 --> 27:54.940\n So it's very difficult to know where you are.\n\n27:54.940 --> 27:58.600\n So you've got this sort of catch 22.\n\n27:58.600 --> 28:00.280\n You can either use an imaging modality\n\n28:00.280 --> 28:02.840\n that tells you within millimeters\n\n28:02.840 --> 28:04.440\n which part of the brain is activated,\n\n28:04.440 --> 28:05.800\n but you don't know when,\n\n28:05.800 --> 28:10.800\n or you've got these electromagnetic EEG, MEG setups\n\n28:10.800 --> 28:15.800\n that tell you to within a few milliseconds\n\n28:15.840 --> 28:19.240\n when something has responded, but you're not aware.\n\n28:19.240 --> 28:22.520\n So you've got these two complementary measures,\n\n28:22.520 --> 28:25.840\n either indirect via the blood flow,\n\n28:25.840 --> 28:28.780\n or direct via the electromagnetic signals\n\n28:28.780 --> 28:31.080\n caused by neural activity.\n\n28:31.080 --> 28:33.360\n These are the two big imaging devices.\n\n28:33.360 --> 28:36.960\n And then the second level of responding to your question,\n\n28:36.960 --> 28:39.440\n what are the, from the outside,\n\n28:39.440 --> 28:44.240\n what are the big ways of using this technology?\n\n28:44.240 --> 28:47.160\n So once you've chosen the kind of neural imaging\n\n28:47.160 --> 28:50.240\n that you want to use to answer your set questions,\n\n28:50.240 --> 28:52.200\n and sometimes it would have to be both,\n\n28:53.360 --> 28:57.540\n then you've got a whole raft of analyses,\n\n28:57.540 --> 29:01.920\n time series analyses usually, that you can bring to bear\n\n29:01.920 --> 29:04.360\n in order to answer your questions\n\n29:04.360 --> 29:07.000\n or address your hypothesis about those data.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.920\n And interestingly, they both fall\n\n29:08.920 --> 29:11.320\n into the same two camps we were talking about before,\n\n29:11.320 --> 29:14.800\n this dialectic between specialization and integration,\n\n29:14.800 --> 29:17.120\n differentiation and integration.\n\n29:17.120 --> 29:20.880\n So it's the cartography, the blobology analyses.\n\n29:20.880 --> 29:23.220\n I apologize, I probably shouldn't interrupt so much,\n\n29:23.220 --> 29:27.080\n but just heard a fun word, the blah.\n\n29:27.080 --> 29:27.920\n Blobology.\n\n29:27.920 --> 29:29.160\n Blobology.\n\n29:29.160 --> 29:33.000\n It's a neologism, which means the study of blobs.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:34.720\n So nothing bob.\n\n29:34.720 --> 29:36.640\n Are you being witty and humorous,\n\n29:36.640 --> 29:39.640\n or does the word blobology ever appear\n\n29:39.640 --> 29:40.760\n in a textbook somewhere?\n\n29:40.760 --> 29:43.320\n It would appear in a popular book.\n\n29:43.320 --> 29:47.960\n It would not appear in a worthy specialist journal.\n\n29:47.960 --> 29:48.960\n Yeah, I thought so.\n\n29:48.960 --> 29:53.560\n It's the fond word for the study of literally little blobs\n\n29:53.560 --> 29:56.160\n on brain maps showing activations.\n\n29:56.160 --> 29:59.500\n So the kind of thing that you'd see in the newspapers\n\n29:59.500 --> 30:04.080\n on ABC or BBC reporting the latest finding\n\n30:04.080 --> 30:05.320\n from brain imaging.\n\n30:05.320 --> 30:10.080\n Interestingly though, the maths involved\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:15.080\n in that stream of analysis does actually call upon\n\n30:15.340 --> 30:17.640\n the mathematics of blobs.\n\n30:17.640 --> 30:21.800\n So seriously, they're actually called Euler characteristics\n\n30:21.800 --> 30:26.800\n and they have a lot of fancy names in mathematics.\n\n30:27.500 --> 30:28.920\n We'll talk about it, about your ideas\n\n30:28.920 --> 30:30.400\n in free energy principle.\n\n30:30.400 --> 30:33.320\n I mean, there's echoes of blobs there\n\n30:33.320 --> 30:36.720\n when you consider sort of entities,\n\n30:36.720 --> 30:38.000\n mathematically speaking.\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.400\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n30:40.800 --> 30:43.080\n Well, circumscribed, well defined,\n\n30:43.080 --> 30:48.080\n you entities of, well, from the free energy point of view,\n\n30:48.120 --> 30:50.280\n entities of anything, but from the point of view\n\n30:50.280 --> 30:55.280\n of the analysis, the cartography of the brain,\n\n30:55.800 --> 30:59.200\n these are the entities that constitute the evidence\n\n30:59.200 --> 31:01.680\n for this functional segregation.\n\n31:01.680 --> 31:04.500\n You have segregated this function in this blob\n\n31:04.500 --> 31:06.760\n and it is not outside of the blob.\n\n31:06.760 --> 31:10.200\n And that's basically the, if you were a map maker\n\n31:10.200 --> 31:14.080\n of America and you did not know its structure,\n\n31:14.080 --> 31:16.400\n the first thing were you doing constituting\n\n31:16.400 --> 31:19.140\n or creating a map would be to identify the cities,\n\n31:19.140 --> 31:22.000\n for example, or the mountains or the rivers.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:26.920\n All of these uniquely spatially localizable features,\n\n31:26.920 --> 31:30.680\n possibly topological features have to be placed somewhere\n\n31:30.680 --> 31:33.520\n because that requires a mathematics of identifying\n\n31:33.520 --> 31:36.080\n what does a city look like on a satellite image\n\n31:36.080 --> 31:37.400\n or what does a river look like\n\n31:37.400 --> 31:39.120\n or what does a mountain look like?\n\n31:39.120 --> 31:42.240\n What would it, you know, what data features\n\n31:42.240 --> 31:46.520\n would evidence that particular top,\n\n31:46.520 --> 31:48.560\n you know, that particular thing\n\n31:48.560 --> 31:50.400\n that you wanted to put on the map?\n\n31:50.400 --> 31:52.760\n And they normally are characterized\n\n31:52.760 --> 31:54.320\n in terms of literally these blobs\n\n31:54.320 --> 31:57.000\n or these sort of, another way of looking at this\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:01.560\n is that a certain statistical measure\n\n32:01.560 --> 32:04.000\n of the degree of activation crosses a threshold\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.520\n and in crossing that threshold\n\n32:06.520 --> 32:09.600\n in the spatially restricted part of the brain,\n\n32:09.600 --> 32:11.040\n it creates a blob.\n\n32:11.040 --> 32:14.000\n And that's basically what statistical parametric mapping does.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:18.580\n It's basically mathematically finessed blobology.\n\n32:19.840 --> 32:20.920\n Okay, so those are the,\n\n32:20.920 --> 32:24.000\n you kind of described these two methodologies for,\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:26.920\n one is temporally noisy, one is spatially noisy\n\n32:26.920 --> 32:28.360\n and you kind of have to play and figure out\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:30.060\n what can be useful.\n\n32:31.400 --> 32:33.000\n It'd be great if you can sort of comment.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.920\n I got a chance recently to spend a day\n\n32:34.920 --> 32:37.200\n at a company called Neuralink\n\n32:37.200 --> 32:39.420\n that uses brain computer interfaces\n\n32:39.420 --> 32:42.720\n and their dream is to, well,\n\n32:42.720 --> 32:45.200\n there's a bunch of sort of dreams,\n\n32:45.200 --> 32:47.380\n but one of them is to understand the brain\n\n32:47.380 --> 32:51.520\n by sort of, you know, getting in there\n\n32:51.520 --> 32:53.800\n past the so called sort of factory wall,\n\n32:53.800 --> 32:55.200\n getting in there and be able to listen,\n\n32:55.200 --> 32:57.160\n communicate both directions.\n\n32:57.160 --> 32:59.360\n What are your thoughts about this,\n\n32:59.360 --> 33:01.040\n the future of this kind of technology\n\n33:01.040 --> 33:02.360\n of brain computer interfaces\n\n33:02.360 --> 33:06.920\n to be able to now have a window\n\n33:06.920 --> 33:08.500\n or direct contact within the brain\n\n33:08.500 --> 33:10.040\n to be able to measure some of the signals,\n\n33:10.040 --> 33:11.320\n to be able to sense signals,\n\n33:11.320 --> 33:15.040\n to understand some of the functionality of the brain?\n\n33:15.040 --> 33:17.760\n Ambivalent, my sense is ambivalent.\n\n33:17.760 --> 33:19.920\n So it's a mixture of good and bad\n\n33:19.920 --> 33:21.420\n and I acknowledge that freely.\n\n33:22.400 --> 33:24.760\n So the good bits, if you just look at the legacy\n\n33:24.760 --> 33:29.240\n of that kind of reciprocal but invasive\n\n33:29.240 --> 33:31.160\n your brain stimulation,\n\n33:31.160 --> 33:33.160\n I didn't paint a complete picture\n\n33:33.160 --> 33:34.680\n when I was talking about sort of the ways\n\n33:34.680 --> 33:37.080\n we understand the brain prior to neuroimaging.\n\n33:37.080 --> 33:39.680\n It wasn't just lesion deficit studies.\n\n33:39.680 --> 33:41.380\n Some of the early work, in fact,\n\n33:41.380 --> 33:43.500\n literally 100 years from where we're sitting\n\n33:43.500 --> 33:45.240\n at the institution of neurology,\n\n33:45.240 --> 33:50.000\n was done by stimulating the brain of say dogs\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.880\n and looking at how they responded\n\n33:51.880 --> 33:56.400\n with their muscles or with their salivation\n\n33:56.400 --> 34:00.920\n and imputing what that part of the brain must be doing.\n\n34:00.920 --> 34:05.920\n If I stimulate it and I vote this kind of response,\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.240\n then that tells me quite a lot\n\n34:07.240 --> 34:09.080\n about the functional specialization.\n\n34:09.080 --> 34:12.280\n So there's a long history of brain stimulation\n\n34:12.280 --> 34:16.840\n which continues to enjoy a lot of attention nowadays.\n\n34:16.840 --> 34:17.720\n Positive attention.\n\n34:17.720 --> 34:19.600\n Oh yes, absolutely.\n\n34:19.600 --> 34:22.160\n You know, deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease\n\n34:22.160 --> 34:23.600\n is now a standard treatment\n\n34:23.600 --> 34:25.560\n and also a wonderful vehicle\n\n34:25.560 --> 34:29.000\n to try and understand the neuronal dynamics\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.960\n underlying movement disorders like Parkinson's disease.\n\n34:33.120 --> 34:37.920\n Even interest in magnetic stimulation,\n\n34:37.920 --> 34:39.240\n stimulating the magnetic fields\n\n34:39.240 --> 34:43.320\n and will it work in people who are depressed, for example.\n\n34:43.320 --> 34:45.700\n Quite a crude level of understanding what you're doing,\n\n34:45.700 --> 34:49.080\n but there is historical evidence\n\n34:49.080 --> 34:51.800\n that these kinds of brute force interventions\n\n34:51.800 --> 34:53.380\n do change things.\n\n34:53.380 --> 34:56.000\n They, you know, it's a little bit like banging the TV\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.240\n when the valves aren't working properly,\n\n34:58.240 --> 35:00.720\n but it's still, it works.\n\n35:00.720 --> 35:04.480\n So, you know, there is a long history.\n\n35:04.480 --> 35:06.820\n Brain computer interfacing or BCI,\n\n35:08.700 --> 35:11.000\n I think is a beautiful example of that.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:12.720\n It's sort of carved out its own niche\n\n35:12.720 --> 35:14.420\n and its own aspirations\n\n35:14.420 --> 35:19.420\n and there've been enormous advances within limits.\n\n35:20.800 --> 35:23.960\n Advances in terms of our ability to understand\n\n35:25.480 --> 35:28.740\n how the brain, the embodied brain,\n\n35:29.720 --> 35:31.520\n engages with the world.\n\n35:32.480 --> 35:34.760\n I'm thinking here of sensory substitution,\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:37.240\n the augmenting our sensory capacities\n\n35:37.240 --> 35:40.820\n by giving ourselves extra ways of sensing\n\n35:40.820 --> 35:42.260\n and sampling the world,\n\n35:42.260 --> 35:47.260\n ranging from sort of trying to replace lost visual signals\n\n35:48.300 --> 35:50.380\n through to giving people completely new signals.\n\n35:50.380 --> 35:55.380\n So, one of the, I think, most engaging examples of this\n\n35:57.100 --> 36:00.660\n is equipping people with a sense of magnetic fields.\n\n36:00.660 --> 36:03.620\n So you can actually give them magnetic sensors\n\n36:03.620 --> 36:05.460\n that enable them to feel,\n\n36:05.460 --> 36:08.980\n should we say, tactile pressure around their tummy,\n\n36:08.980 --> 36:13.100\n where they are in relation to the magnetic field of the Earth.\n\n36:13.100 --> 36:17.660\n And after a few weeks, they take it for granted.\n\n36:17.660 --> 36:19.340\n They integrate it, they embody this,\n\n36:19.340 --> 36:22.340\n simulate this new sensory information\n\n36:22.340 --> 36:25.420\n into the way that they literally feel their world,\n\n36:25.420 --> 36:29.300\n but now equipped with this sense of magnetic direction.\n\n36:29.300 --> 36:31.020\n So that tells you something\n\n36:31.020 --> 36:32.980\n about the brain's plastic potential\n\n36:32.980 --> 36:37.980\n to remodel and its plastic capacity\n\n36:37.980 --> 36:42.980\n to suddenly try to explain the sensory data at hand\n\n36:43.640 --> 36:48.440\n by augmenting the sensory sphere\n\n36:48.440 --> 36:50.680\n and the kinds of things that you can measure.\n\n36:51.600 --> 36:54.720\n Clearly, that's purely for entertainment\n\n36:54.720 --> 36:58.800\n and understanding the nature and the power of our brains.\n\n37:00.120 --> 37:03.400\n I would imagine that most BCI is pitched\n\n37:03.400 --> 37:08.400\n at solving clinical and human problems\n\n37:08.600 --> 37:12.240\n such as locked in syndrome, such as paraplegia,\n\n37:12.240 --> 37:16.120\n or replacing lost sensory capacities\n\n37:16.120 --> 37:18.960\n like blindness and deafness.\n\n37:18.960 --> 37:23.960\n So then we come to the negative part of my ambivalence,\n\n37:24.240 --> 37:25.480\n the other side of it.\n\n37:26.960 --> 37:30.960\n So I don't want to be deflationary\n\n37:30.960 --> 37:33.400\n because much of my deflationary comments\n\n37:33.400 --> 37:37.120\n is probably large out of ignorance than anything else.\n\n37:37.120 --> 37:42.120\n But generally speaking, the bandwidth\n\n37:42.480 --> 37:44.360\n and the bit rates that you get\n\n37:44.360 --> 37:49.160\n from brain computer interfaces as we currently know them,\n\n37:49.160 --> 37:51.460\n we're talking about bits per second.\n\n37:51.460 --> 37:55.600\n So that would be like me only being able to communicate\n\n37:55.600 --> 38:00.600\n with any world or with you using very, very, very slow Morse code.\n\n38:06.560 --> 38:11.560\n And it is not even within an order of magnitude\n\n38:13.440 --> 38:18.440\n near what we actually need for an inactive realization\n\n38:18.600 --> 38:21.280\n of what people aspire to when they think about\n\n38:21.280 --> 38:26.280\n sort of curing people with paraplegia or replacing sight\n\n38:28.760 --> 38:30.280\n despite heroic efforts.\n\n38:30.280 --> 38:33.760\n So one has to ask, is there a lower bound\n\n38:33.760 --> 38:38.760\n on the kinds of recurrent information exchange\n\n38:41.040 --> 38:46.040\n between a brain and some augmented or artificial interface?\n\n38:46.040 --> 38:51.040\n And then we come back to, interestingly,\n\n38:51.620 --> 38:52.820\n what I was talking about before,\n\n38:52.820 --> 38:56.460\n which is if you're talking about function\n\n38:56.460 --> 39:00.220\n in terms of inference, and I presume we'll get to that\n\n39:00.220 --> 39:01.900\n later on in terms of the free energy principle,\n\n39:01.900 --> 39:05.140\n then at the moment, there may be fundamental reasons\n\n39:05.140 --> 39:06.400\n to assume that is the case.\n\n39:06.400 --> 39:08.540\n We're talking about ensemble activity.\n\n39:08.540 --> 39:13.540\n We're talking about basically, for example,\n\n39:13.540 --> 39:18.540\n let's paint the challenge facing brain computer interfacing\n\n39:20.800 --> 39:24.520\n in terms of controlling another system\n\n39:24.520 --> 39:27.080\n that is highly and deeply structured,\n\n39:27.080 --> 39:30.560\n very relevant to our lives, very nonlinear,\n\n39:30.560 --> 39:34.360\n that rests upon the kind of nonequilibrium\n\n39:34.360 --> 39:37.400\n steady states and dynamics that the brain does,\n\n39:37.400 --> 39:39.540\n the weather, all right?\n\n39:39.540 --> 39:44.540\n So imagine you had some very aggressive satellites\n\n39:45.840 --> 39:48.280\n that could produce signals that could perturb\n\n39:48.280 --> 39:53.000\n some little parts of the weather system.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.140\n And then what you're asking now is,\n\n39:55.140 --> 39:58.320\n can I meaningfully get into the weather\n\n39:58.320 --> 40:01.300\n and change it meaningfully and make the weather respond\n\n40:01.300 --> 40:03.360\n in a way that I want it to?\n\n40:03.360 --> 40:06.600\n You're talking about chaos control on a scale\n\n40:06.600 --> 40:08.860\n which is almost unimaginable.\n\n40:08.860 --> 40:11.120\n So there may be fundamental reasons\n\n40:11.120 --> 40:16.120\n why BCI, as you might read about it in a science fiction novel,\n\n40:18.480 --> 40:22.920\n aspirational BCI may never actually work\n\n40:22.920 --> 40:26.920\n in the sense that to really be integrated\n\n40:26.920 --> 40:31.920\n and be part of the system is a requirement\n\n40:32.160 --> 40:35.240\n that requires you to have evolved with that system,\n\n40:35.240 --> 40:40.240\n that you have to be part of a very delicately structured,\n\n40:43.320 --> 40:48.000\n deeply structured, dynamic, ensemble activity\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.600\n that is not like rewiring a broken computer\n\n40:51.600 --> 40:54.660\n or plugging in a peripheral interface adapter.\n\n40:54.660 --> 40:58.140\n It is much more like getting into the weather patterns\n\n40:58.140 --> 41:00.680\n or, come back to your magic soup,\n\n41:00.680 --> 41:02.420\n getting into the active matter\n\n41:02.420 --> 41:07.140\n and meaningfully relate that to the outside world.\n\n41:07.140 --> 41:09.920\n So I think there are enormous challenges there.\n\n41:09.920 --> 41:13.260\n So I think the example of the weather is a brilliant one.\n\n41:13.260 --> 41:15.300\n And I think you paint a really interesting picture\n\n41:15.300 --> 41:17.420\n and it wasn't as negative as I thought.\n\n41:17.420 --> 41:19.920\n It's essentially saying that it might be\n\n41:19.920 --> 41:22.140\n incredibly challenging, including the low bound\n\n41:22.140 --> 41:23.640\n of the bandwidth and so on.\n\n41:23.640 --> 41:26.900\n I kind of, so just to full disclosure,\n\n41:26.900 --> 41:28.680\n I come from the machine learning world.\n\n41:28.680 --> 41:32.760\n So my natural thought is the hardest part\n\n41:32.760 --> 41:34.820\n is the engineering challenge of controlling the weather,\n\n41:34.820 --> 41:37.560\n of getting those satellites up and running and so on.\n\n41:37.560 --> 41:42.220\n And once they are, then the rest is fundamentally\n\n41:42.220 --> 41:46.860\n the same approaches that allow you to win in the game of Go\n\n41:46.860 --> 41:49.580\n will allow you to potentially play in this soup,\n\n41:49.580 --> 41:51.000\n in this chaos.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:54.500\n So I have a hope that sort of machine learning methods\n\n41:54.500 --> 41:58.820\n will help us play in this soup.\n\n41:58.820 --> 42:03.820\n But perhaps you're right that it is a biology\n\n42:04.220 --> 42:08.660\n and the brain is just an incredible system\n\n42:08.660 --> 42:12.220\n that may be almost impossible to get in.\n\n42:12.220 --> 42:15.780\n But for me, what seems impossible\n\n42:15.780 --> 42:19.780\n is the incredible mess of blood vessels\n\n42:19.780 --> 42:22.300\n that you also described without,\n\n42:22.300 --> 42:24.620\n we also value the brain.\n\n42:24.620 --> 42:27.100\n You can't make any mistakes, you can't damage things.\n\n42:27.100 --> 42:31.340\n So to me, that engineering challenge seems nearly impossible.\n\n42:31.340 --> 42:35.900\n One of the things I was really impressed by at Neuralink\n\n42:35.900 --> 42:39.660\n is just talking to brilliant neurosurgeons\n\n42:39.660 --> 42:43.340\n and the roboticists that made me realize\n\n42:43.340 --> 42:45.860\n that even though it seems impossible,\n\n42:45.860 --> 42:48.620\n if anyone can do it, it's some of these world class\n\n42:48.620 --> 42:50.800\n engineers that are trying to take it on.\n\n42:50.800 --> 42:55.800\n So I think the conclusion of our discussion here\n\n42:55.860 --> 43:00.860\n of this part is basically that the problem is really hard\n\n43:00.980 --> 43:02.580\n but hopefully not impossible.\n\n43:02.580 --> 43:03.800\n Absolutely.\n\n43:03.800 --> 43:07.260\n So if it's okay, let's start with the basics.\n\n43:07.260 --> 43:12.180\n So you've also formulated a fascinating principle,\n\n43:12.180 --> 43:13.500\n the free energy principle.\n\n43:13.500 --> 43:15.340\n Could we maybe start at the basics\n\n43:15.340 --> 43:19.660\n and what is the free energy principle?\n\n43:19.660 --> 43:22.260\n Well, in fact, the free energy principle\n\n43:23.700 --> 43:28.700\n inherits a lot from the building\n\n43:29.220 --> 43:31.240\n of these data analytic approaches\n\n43:31.240 --> 43:34.180\n to these very high dimensional time series\n\n43:34.180 --> 43:35.960\n you get from the brain.\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:37.940\n So I think it's interesting to acknowledge that.\n\n43:37.940 --> 43:39.980\n And in particular, the analysis tools\n\n43:39.980 --> 43:43.100\n that try to address the other side,\n\n43:43.100 --> 43:44.360\n which is a functional integration,\n\n43:44.360 --> 43:46.060\n so the connectivity analyses.\n\n43:46.060 --> 43:51.060\n So on the one hand, but I should also acknowledge\n\n43:51.920 --> 43:55.360\n it inherits an awful lot from machine learning as well.\n\n43:55.360 --> 44:00.360\n So the free energy principle is just a formal statement\n\n44:02.600 --> 44:07.600\n that the existential imperatives for any system\n\n44:08.500 --> 44:11.380\n that manages to survive in a changing world\n\n44:11.380 --> 44:16.380\n can be cast as an inference problem\n\n44:18.900 --> 44:21.240\n in the sense that you can interpret\n\n44:21.240 --> 44:25.720\n the probability of existing as the evidence that you exist.\n\n44:25.720 --> 44:29.460\n And if you can write down that problem of existence\n\n44:29.460 --> 44:30.900\n as a statistical problem,\n\n44:30.900 --> 44:33.940\n then you can use all the maths that has been developed\n\n44:33.940 --> 44:38.940\n for inference to understand and characterize\n\n44:38.940 --> 44:42.960\n the ensemble dynamics that must be in play\n\n44:42.960 --> 44:45.560\n in the service of that inference.\n\n44:45.560 --> 44:48.240\n So technically, what that means is\n\n44:48.240 --> 44:51.160\n you can always interpret anything that exists\n\n44:52.160 --> 44:55.660\n in virtue of being separate from the environment\n\n44:55.660 --> 45:00.660\n in which it exists as trying to minimize\n\n45:02.100 --> 45:03.600\n variational free energy.\n\n45:03.600 --> 45:05.560\n And if you're from the machine learning community,\n\n45:05.560 --> 45:09.200\n you will know that as a negative evidence lower bound\n\n45:09.200 --> 45:13.120\n or a negative elbow, which is the same as saying\n\n45:13.120 --> 45:16.400\n you're trying to maximize or it will look as if\n\n45:16.400 --> 45:19.720\n all your dynamics are trying to maximize\n\n45:19.720 --> 45:24.000\n the complement of that which is the marginal likelihood\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.480\n or the evidence for your own existence.\n\n45:26.480 --> 45:30.120\n So that's basically the free energy principle.\n\n45:30.120 --> 45:34.120\n But to even take a sort of a small step backwards,\n\n45:34.120 --> 45:37.120\n you said the existential imperative.\n\n45:38.360 --> 45:40.120\n There's a lot of beautiful poetic words here,\n\n45:40.120 --> 45:45.120\n but to put it crudely, it's a fascinating idea\n\n45:46.840 --> 45:49.520\n of basically just of trying to describe\n\n45:49.520 --> 45:51.800\n if you're looking at a blob,\n\n45:51.800 --> 45:54.320\n how do you know this thing is alive?\n\n45:54.320 --> 45:55.680\n What does it mean to be alive?\n\n45:55.680 --> 45:57.520\n What does it mean to exist?\n\n45:57.520 --> 45:59.440\n And so you can look at the brain,\n\n45:59.440 --> 46:00.720\n you can look at parts of the brain,\n\n46:00.720 --> 46:02.840\n or this is just a general principle\n\n46:02.840 --> 46:07.240\n that applies to almost any system.\n\n46:07.240 --> 46:10.160\n That's just a fascinating sort of philosophically\n\n46:10.160 --> 46:13.120\n at every level question and a methodology\n\n46:13.120 --> 46:14.360\n to try to answer that question.\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:16.040\n What does it mean to be alive?\n\n46:16.040 --> 46:21.040\n So that's a huge endeavor and it's nice\n\n46:21.480 --> 46:23.200\n that there's at least some,\n\n46:23.200 --> 46:25.480\n from some perspective, a clean answer.\n\n46:25.480 --> 46:30.280\n So maybe can you talk about that optimization view of it?\n\n46:30.280 --> 46:33.520\n So what's trying to be minimized, maximized?\n\n46:33.520 --> 46:36.840\n A system that's alive, what is it trying to minimize?\n\n46:36.840 --> 46:39.360\n Right, you've made a big move there.\n\n46:40.600 --> 46:44.000\n First of all, it's good to make big moves.\n\n46:45.960 --> 46:50.960\n But you've assumed that the thing exists\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.680\n in a state that could be living or nonliving.\n\n46:54.680 --> 46:57.960\n So I may ask you, what licenses you\n\n46:57.960 --> 47:00.120\n to say that something exists?\n\n47:00.120 --> 47:02.280\n That's why I use the word existential.\n\n47:02.280 --> 47:05.440\n It's beyond living, it's just existence.\n\n47:05.440 --> 47:08.000\n So if you drill down onto the definition\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:13.000\n of things that exist, then they have certain properties\n\n47:13.520 --> 47:16.400\n if you borrow the maths\n\n47:16.400 --> 47:19.360\n from nonequilibrium steady state physics\n\n47:19.360 --> 47:24.360\n that enable you to interpret their existence\n\n47:26.240 --> 47:29.280\n in terms of this optimization procedure.\n\n47:29.280 --> 47:32.160\n So it's good you introduced the word optimization.\n\n47:32.160 --> 47:36.000\n So what the free energy principle\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:39.800\n in its sort of most ambitious,\n\n47:39.800 --> 47:44.720\n but also most deflationary and simplest, says\n\n47:44.720 --> 47:47.200\n is that if something exists,\n\n47:47.200 --> 47:51.440\n then it must, by the mathematics\n\n47:51.440 --> 47:55.120\n of nonequilibrium steady state,\n\n47:55.120 --> 47:59.600\n exhibit properties that make it look\n\n47:59.600 --> 48:03.680\n as if it is optimizing a particular quantity.\n\n48:03.680 --> 48:06.120\n And it turns out that particular quantity\n\n48:06.120 --> 48:08.520\n happens to be exactly the same\n\n48:08.520 --> 48:11.360\n as the evidence lower bound in machine learning\n\n48:11.360 --> 48:15.280\n or Bayesian model evidence in Bayesian statistics.\n\n48:15.280 --> 48:18.800\n Or, and then I can list a whole other list\n\n48:18.800 --> 48:23.480\n of ways of understanding this key quantity,\n\n48:23.480 --> 48:28.480\n which is a bound on surprise or self information\n\n48:29.120 --> 48:31.000\n if you have information theory.\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:34.080\n There are a number of different perspectives\n\n48:34.080 --> 48:34.920\n on this quantity.\n\n48:34.920 --> 48:36.920\n It's just basically the log probability\n\n48:36.920 --> 48:40.120\n of being in a particular state.\n\n48:40.120 --> 48:42.840\n I'm telling this story as an honest,\n\n48:42.840 --> 48:44.560\n an attempt to answer your question.\n\n48:45.640 --> 48:49.280\n And I'm answering it as if I was pretending\n\n48:49.280 --> 48:52.400\n to be a physicist who was trying to understand\n\n48:52.400 --> 48:57.120\n the fundaments of nonequilibrium steady state.\n\n48:58.040 --> 48:59.640\n And I shouldn't really be doing that\n\n48:59.640 --> 49:02.240\n because the last time I was taught physics,\n\n49:02.240 --> 49:03.760\n I was in my 20s.\n\n49:03.760 --> 49:04.720\n What kind of systems,\n\n49:04.720 --> 49:06.400\n when you think about the free energy principle,\n\n49:06.400 --> 49:08.640\n what kind of systems are you imagining\n\n49:08.640 --> 49:11.640\n as a sort of more specific kind of case study?\n\n49:11.640 --> 49:15.720\n Yeah, I'm imagining a range of systems,\n\n49:15.720 --> 49:22.720\n but at its simplest, a single celled organism\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:26.120\n that can be identified from its eco niche\n\n49:26.120 --> 49:27.680\n or its environment.\n\n49:27.680 --> 49:31.480\n So at its simplest, that's basically\n\n49:31.480 --> 49:33.840\n what I always imagined in my head.\n\n49:33.840 --> 49:36.680\n And you may ask, well, is there any,\n\n49:36.680 --> 49:41.680\n how on earth can you even elaborate questions\n\n49:41.680 --> 49:46.680\n about the existence of a single drop of oil, for example?\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:49.440\n But there are deep questions there.\n\n49:49.440 --> 49:52.560\n Why doesn't the oil, why doesn't the thing,\n\n49:52.560 --> 49:55.160\n the interface between the drop of oil\n\n49:55.160 --> 49:57.480\n that contains an interior\n\n49:57.480 --> 50:00.320\n and the thing that is not the drop of oil,\n\n50:00.320 --> 50:03.880\n which is the solvent in which it is immersed,\n\n50:03.880 --> 50:07.080\n how does that interface persist over time?\n\n50:07.080 --> 50:10.400\n Why doesn't the oil just dissolve into solvent?\n\n50:10.400 --> 50:16.160\n So what special properties of the exchange\n\n50:16.160 --> 50:18.200\n between the surface of the oil drop\n\n50:18.200 --> 50:22.000\n and the external states in which it's immersed,\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.040\n if you're a physicist, say it would be the heat bath.\n\n50:24.040 --> 50:28.280\n You've got a physical system, an ensemble again,\n\n50:28.280 --> 50:30.320\n we're talking about density dynamics, ensemble dynamics,\n\n50:30.320 --> 50:35.840\n an ensemble of atoms or molecules immersed in the heat bath.\n\n50:35.840 --> 50:38.760\n But the question is, how did the heat bath get there?\n\n50:38.760 --> 50:41.360\n And why does it not dissolve?\n\n50:41.360 --> 50:42.800\n How is it maintaining itself?\n\n50:42.800 --> 50:43.640\n Exactly.\n\n50:43.640 --> 50:44.480\n What actions is it?\n\n50:44.480 --> 50:47.520\n I mean, it's such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil\n\n50:47.520 --> 50:50.000\n and I guess it would dissolve in water,\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:51.680\n it wouldn't dissolve in water.\n\n50:51.680 --> 50:52.520\n So what?\n\n50:52.520 --> 50:53.840\n Precisely, so why not?\n\n50:53.840 --> 50:54.680\n So why not?\n\n50:54.680 --> 50:55.520\n Why not?\n\n50:55.520 --> 50:57.000\n And how do you mathematically describe,\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:58.680\n I mean, it's such a beautiful idea.\n\n50:58.680 --> 51:02.120\n And also the idea of like, where does the thing,\n\n51:02.120 --> 51:07.120\n where does the drop of oil end and where does it begin?\n\n51:07.120 --> 51:10.400\n Right, so I mean, you're asking deep questions,\n\n51:10.400 --> 51:12.520\n deep in a nonmillennial sense here.\n\n51:12.520 --> 51:16.280\n In a hierarchical sense.\n\n51:16.280 --> 51:21.280\n But what you can do, so this is the deflationary part of it.\n\n51:21.720 --> 51:23.920\n Can I just qualify my answer by saying that normally\n\n51:23.920 --> 51:24.760\n when I'm asked this question,\n\n51:24.760 --> 51:26.640\n I answer from the point of view of a psychologist,\n\n51:26.640 --> 51:29.080\n we talk about predictive processing and predictive coding\n\n51:29.080 --> 51:31.640\n and the brain as an inference machine,\n\n51:31.640 --> 51:33.920\n but you haven't asked me from that perspective,\n\n51:33.920 --> 51:36.240\n I'm answering from the point of view of a physicist.\n\n51:36.240 --> 51:41.000\n So the question is not so much why,\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:44.440\n but if it exists, what properties must it display?\n\n51:44.440 --> 51:46.880\n So that's the deflationary part of the free energy principle.\n\n51:46.880 --> 51:50.800\n The free energy principle does not supply an answer\n\n51:50.800 --> 51:54.520\n as to why, it's saying if something exists,\n\n51:54.520 --> 51:57.720\n then it must display these properties.\n\n51:57.720 --> 52:01.560\n That's the sort of thing that's on offer.\n\n52:01.560 --> 52:05.240\n And it so happens that these properties it must display\n\n52:05.240 --> 52:10.240\n are actually intriguing and have this inferential gloss,\n\n52:10.880 --> 52:14.920\n this sort of self evidencing gloss that inherits on the fact\n\n52:14.920 --> 52:19.720\n that the very preservation of the boundary\n\n52:19.720 --> 52:22.640\n between the oil drop and the not oil drop\n\n52:22.640 --> 52:26.160\n requires an optimization of a particular function\n\n52:26.160 --> 52:30.600\n or a functional that defines the presence\n\n52:30.600 --> 52:33.040\n or the existence of this oil drop,\n\n52:33.040 --> 52:36.160\n which is why I started with existential imperatives.\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:39.520\n It is a necessary condition for existence\n\n52:39.520 --> 52:42.880\n that this must occur because the boundary\n\n52:42.880 --> 52:46.040\n basically defines the thing that's existing.\n\n52:46.040 --> 52:47.960\n So it is that self assembly aspect\n\n52:47.960 --> 52:53.080\n it's that you were hinting at in biology,\n\n52:53.080 --> 52:55.720\n sometimes known as autopoiesis\n\n52:56.880 --> 53:00.160\n in computational chemistry with self assembly.\n\n53:00.160 --> 53:03.600\n It's the, what does it look like?\n\n53:03.600 --> 53:06.040\n Sorry, how would you describe things\n\n53:06.040 --> 53:08.640\n that configure themselves out of nothing?\n\n53:08.640 --> 53:12.000\n The way they clearly demarcate themselves\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:16.680\n from the states or the soup in which they are immersed.\n\n53:18.240 --> 53:20.920\n So from the point of view of computational chemistry,\n\n53:20.920 --> 53:23.440\n for example, you would just understand that\n\n53:23.440 --> 53:25.440\n as a configuration of a macro molecule\n\n53:25.440 --> 53:28.920\n to minimize its free energy, its thermodynamic free energy.\n\n53:28.920 --> 53:31.480\n It's exactly the same principle that we've been talking about\n\n53:31.480 --> 53:35.040\n that thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow.\n\n53:35.040 --> 53:38.200\n It's the same mathematical construct.\n\n53:38.200 --> 53:42.520\n So the very emergence of existence, of structure, of form\n\n53:42.520 --> 53:45.040\n that can be distinguished from the environment\n\n53:45.040 --> 53:47.280\n or the thing that is not the thing\n\n53:49.240 --> 53:54.240\n necessitates the existence of an objective function\n\n53:56.120 --> 53:58.160\n that it looks as if it is minimizing.\n\n53:58.160 --> 54:00.280\n It's finding a free energy minima.\n\n54:00.280 --> 54:04.880\n And so just to clarify, I'm trying to wrap my head around.\n\n54:04.880 --> 54:09.560\n So the free energy principle says that if something exists,\n\n54:09.560 --> 54:11.520\n these are the properties it should display.\n\n54:11.520 --> 54:12.520\n Yeah.\n\n54:12.520 --> 54:17.520\n So what that means is we can't just look,\n\n54:17.520 --> 54:21.320\n we can't just go into a soup and there's no mechanism.\n\n54:21.320 --> 54:23.480\n Free energy principle doesn't give us a mechanism\n\n54:23.480 --> 54:25.680\n to find the things that exist.\n\n54:25.680 --> 54:28.680\n Is that what's implying, is being implied\n\n54:28.680 --> 54:33.200\n that you can kind of use it to reason,\n\n54:33.200 --> 54:36.040\n to think about like, study a particular system\n\n54:36.040 --> 54:39.120\n and say, does this exhibit these qualities?\n\n54:40.600 --> 54:42.400\n That's an excellent question.\n\n54:42.400 --> 54:44.680\n But to answer that, I'd have to return\n\n54:44.680 --> 54:46.240\n to your previous question about what's the difference\n\n54:46.240 --> 54:48.520\n between living and nonliving things.\n\n54:48.520 --> 54:51.880\n Yes, well, actually, sorry.\n\n54:51.880 --> 54:54.080\n So yeah, maybe we can go there.\n\n54:54.080 --> 54:57.160\n Maybe we can go there, you kind of drew a line\n\n54:57.160 --> 54:58.960\n and forgive me for the stupid questions,\n\n54:58.960 --> 55:02.560\n but you kind of drew a line between living and existing.\n\n55:02.560 --> 55:07.200\n Is there an interesting sort of distinction?\n\n55:07.200 --> 55:08.760\n Yeah, I think there is.\n\n55:09.600 --> 55:14.600\n So things do exist, grains of sand,\n\n55:15.240 --> 55:19.480\n rocks on the moon, trees, you.\n\n55:19.480 --> 55:24.480\n So all of these things can be separated from the environment\n\n55:24.960 --> 55:26.320\n in which they are immersed.\n\n55:26.320 --> 55:28.200\n And therefore, they must at some level\n\n55:28.200 --> 55:31.320\n be optimizing their free energy,\n\n55:32.320 --> 55:36.200\n taking this sort of model evidence interpretation\n\n55:36.200 --> 55:38.160\n of this quantity that basically means\n\n55:38.160 --> 55:39.640\n they're self evidencing.\n\n55:39.640 --> 55:42.840\n Another nice little twist of phrase here\n\n55:42.840 --> 55:45.520\n is that you are your own existence proof,\n\n55:45.520 --> 55:48.880\n statistically speaking, which I don't think\n\n55:48.880 --> 55:51.800\n I said that, somebody did, but I love that phrase.\n\n55:53.480 --> 55:55.600\n You are your own existence proof.\n\n55:55.600 --> 55:58.040\n Yeah, so it's so existential, isn't it?\n\n55:59.280 --> 56:01.440\n I'm gonna have to think about that for a few days.\n\n56:01.440 --> 56:06.080\n That's a beautiful line.\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:09.760\n So the step through to answer your question\n\n56:09.760 --> 56:11.560\n about what's it good for,\n\n56:13.840 --> 56:15.760\n we'll go along the following lines.\n\n56:15.760 --> 56:18.720\n First of all, you have to define what it means\n\n56:18.720 --> 56:22.040\n to exist, which now, as you've rightly pointed out,\n\n56:22.040 --> 56:25.000\n you have to define what probabilistic properties\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.440\n must the states of something possess\n\n56:27.440 --> 56:30.600\n so it knows where it finishes.\n\n56:30.600 --> 56:32.720\n And then you write that down in terms\n\n56:32.720 --> 56:36.000\n of statistical dependencies, again, sparsity.\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:39.680\n Again, it's not what's connected or what's correlated\n\n56:39.680 --> 56:43.720\n or what depends upon, it's what's not correlated\n\n56:43.720 --> 56:45.960\n and what doesn't depend upon something.\n\n56:45.960 --> 56:49.680\n Again, it comes down to the deep structures,\n\n56:49.680 --> 56:50.920\n not in this instance, hierarchical,\n\n56:50.920 --> 56:54.040\n but the structures that emerge\n\n56:54.040 --> 56:56.920\n from removing connectivity and dependency.\n\n56:56.920 --> 57:00.160\n And in this instance, basically being able\n\n57:00.160 --> 57:02.720\n to identify the surface of the oil drop\n\n57:02.720 --> 57:06.480\n from the water in which it is immersed.\n\n57:06.480 --> 57:09.120\n And when you do that, you start to realize,\n\n57:09.120 --> 57:12.720\n well, there are actually four kinds of states\n\n57:12.720 --> 57:15.680\n in any given universe that contains anything.\n\n57:15.680 --> 57:18.840\n The things that are internal to the surface,\n\n57:18.840 --> 57:20.680\n the things that are external to the surface\n\n57:20.680 --> 57:22.560\n and the surface in and of itself,\n\n57:22.560 --> 57:24.040\n which is why I use a metaphor,\n\n57:24.040 --> 57:25.440\n a little single celled organism\n\n57:25.440 --> 57:27.080\n that has an interior and exterior\n\n57:27.080 --> 57:29.520\n and then the surface of the cell.\n\n57:29.520 --> 57:32.720\n And that's mathematically a Markov blanket.\n\n57:32.720 --> 57:34.960\n Just to pause, I'm in awe of this concept\n\n57:34.960 --> 57:36.560\n that there's the stuff outside the surface,\n\n57:36.560 --> 57:38.960\n stuff inside the surface and the surface itself,\n\n57:38.960 --> 57:40.240\n the Markov blanket.\n\n57:40.240 --> 57:43.680\n It's just the most beautiful kind of notion\n\n57:43.680 --> 57:46.160\n about trying to explore what it means\n\n57:46.160 --> 57:48.240\n to exist mathematically.\n\n57:48.240 --> 57:50.720\n I apologize, it's just a beautiful idea.\n\n57:50.720 --> 57:53.080\n But it came out of California, so that's.\n\n57:53.080 --> 57:54.000\n I changed my mind.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:55.080\n I take it all back.\n\n57:55.080 --> 57:59.440\n So anyway, so you were just talking\n\n57:59.440 --> 58:01.280\n about the surface, about the Markov blanket.\n\n58:01.280 --> 58:04.680\n So this surface or these blanket states\n\n58:04.680 --> 58:09.680\n that are the, because they are now defined\n\n58:09.680 --> 58:14.680\n in relation to these independencies\n\n58:17.560 --> 58:21.560\n and what different states internal blanket\n\n58:21.560 --> 58:23.840\n or external states can,\n\n58:23.840 --> 58:25.280\n which ones can influence each other\n\n58:25.280 --> 58:27.760\n and which cannot influence each other.\n\n58:27.760 --> 58:30.960\n You can now apply standard results\n\n58:30.960 --> 58:33.600\n that you would find in non equilibrium physics\n\n58:33.600 --> 58:37.880\n or steady state or thermodynamics or hydrodynamics,\n\n58:37.880 --> 58:41.640\n usually out of equilibrium solutions\n\n58:41.640 --> 58:43.200\n and apply them to this partition.\n\n58:43.200 --> 58:48.120\n And what it looks like is if all the normal gradient flows\n\n58:48.120 --> 58:52.080\n that you would associate with any non equilibrium system\n\n58:52.080 --> 58:57.080\n apply in such a way that part of the Markov blanket\n\n58:57.600 --> 59:01.560\n and the internal states seem to be hill climbing\n\n59:01.560 --> 59:05.840\n or doing a gradient descent on the same quantity.\n\n59:05.840 --> 59:09.360\n And that means that you can now describe\n\n59:09.360 --> 59:13.120\n the very existence of this oil drop.\n\n59:13.120 --> 59:16.000\n You can write down the existence of this oil drop\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:20.600\n in terms of flows, dynamics, equations of motion,\n\n59:20.600 --> 59:24.160\n where the blanket states or part of them,\n\n59:24.160 --> 59:28.040\n we call them active states and the internal states\n\n59:28.040 --> 59:32.680\n now seem to be and must be trying to look\n\n59:32.680 --> 59:35.480\n as if they're minimizing the same function,\n\n59:35.480 --> 59:39.280\n which is a low probability of occupying these states.\n\n59:39.280 --> 59:44.040\n Interesting thing is that what would they be called\n\n59:44.040 --> 59:45.680\n if you were trying to describe these things?\n\n59:45.680 --> 59:50.080\n So what we're talking about are internal states,\n\n59:50.080 --> 59:52.040\n external states and blanket states.\n\n59:52.040 --> 59:54.080\n Now let's carve the blanket states\n\n59:54.080 --> 59:57.200\n into two sensory states and active states.\n\n59:57.200 --> 59:59.520\n Operationally, it has to be the case\n\n59:59.520 --> 1:00:01.720\n that in order for this carving up\n\n1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:04.440\n into different sets of states to exist,\n\n1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:06.800\n the active states, the Markov blanket\n\n1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:09.800\n cannot be influenced by the external states.\n\n1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.560\n And we already know that the internal states\n\n1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:13.640\n can't be influenced by the external states\n\n1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:15.720\n because the blanket separates them.\n\n1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:16.560\n So what does that mean?\n\n1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:19.280\n Well, it means the active states, the internal states\n\n1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:23.440\n are now jointly not influenced by external states.\n\n1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:26.120\n They only have autonomous dynamics.\n\n1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:30.000\n So now you've got a picture of an oil drop\n\n1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.040\n that has autonomy, it has autonomous states,\n\n1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:35.440\n it has autonomous states in the sense\n\n1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:38.320\n that there must be some parts of the surface of the oil drop\n\n1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:40.400\n that are not influenced by the external states\n\n1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:41.880\n and all the interior.\n\n1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:44.520\n And together, those two states endow\n\n1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.640\n even a little oil drop with autonomous states\n\n1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:51.360\n that look as if they are optimizing\n\n1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:55.200\n their variational free energy or their negative elbow,\n\n1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:57.840\n their moral evidence.\n\n1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:03.240\n And that would be an interesting intellectual exercise.\n\n1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:05.600\n And you could say, you could even go into the realms\n\n1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:08.160\n of panpsychism, that everything that exists\n\n1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:12.080\n is implicitly making inferences on self evidencing.\n\n1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.040\n Now we make the next move, but what about living things?\n\n1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:19.200\n I mean, so let me ask you,\n\n1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:21.600\n what's the difference between an oil drop\n\n1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:26.600\n and a little tadpole or a little lava or a plankton?\n\n1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:29.640\n The picture was just painted of an oil drop.\n\n1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.840\n Just immediately in a matter of minutes\n\n1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:35.200\n took me into the world of panpsychism,\n\n1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:38.040\n where you've just convinced me,\n\n1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:41.240\n made me feel like an oil drop is a living,\n\n1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:43.400\n it's certainly an autonomous system,\n\n1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:44.720\n but almost a living system.\n\n1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:48.960\n So it has sensory capabilities and acting capabilities\n\n1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:50.600\n and it maintains something.\n\n1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:53.920\n So what is the difference between that\n\n1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:56.120\n and something that we traditionally\n\n1:01:56.120 --> 1:01:57.680\n think of as a living system?\n\n1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:02.200\n That it could die or it can't,\n\n1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.240\n I mean, yeah, mortality, I'm not exactly sure.\n\n1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:07.400\n I'm not sure what the right answer there is\n\n1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:09.640\n because they can move,\n\n1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:11.840\n like movement seems like an essential element\n\n1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:13.520\n to being able to act in the environment,\n\n1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:15.800\n but the oil drop is doing that.\n\n1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:16.640\n So I don't know.\n\n1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:18.120\n Is it?\n\n1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:19.720\n The oil drop will be moved,\n\n1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:22.640\n but does it in and of itself move autonomously?\n\n1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:26.880\n Well, the surface is performing actions\n\n1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:29.680\n that maintain its structure.\n\n1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:30.800\n Yeah, you're being too clever.\n\n1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:34.560\n I was, I had in mind a passive little oil drop\n\n1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:37.680\n that's sitting there at the bottom\n\n1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:39.240\n on the top of a glass of water.\n\n1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:40.600\n Sure, I guess.\n\n1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:42.200\n What I'm trying to say is you're absolutely right.\n\n1:02:42.200 --> 1:02:44.400\n You've nailed it.\n\n1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:45.880\n It's movement.\n\n1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:47.200\n So where does that movement come from?\n\n1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:49.400\n If it comes from the inside,\n\n1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:52.000\n then you've got, I think, something that's living.\n\n1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:54.680\n What do you mean from the inside?\n\n1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:58.840\n What I mean is that the internal states\n\n1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:01.040\n that can influence the active states,\n\n1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:02.600\n where the active states can influence,\n\n1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:05.120\n but they're not influenced by the external states,\n\n1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:07.160\n can cause movement.\n\n1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.440\n So there are two types of oil drops, if you like.\n\n1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:12.800\n There are oil drops where the internal states\n\n1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:17.800\n are so random that they average themselves away,\n\n1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:23.800\n and the thing cannot, on average,\n\n1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.960\n when you do the averaging, move.\n\n1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:29.400\n So a nice example of that would be the Sun.\n\n1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:31.160\n The Sun certainly has internal states.\n\n1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:34.360\n There's lots of intrinsic autonomous activity going on,\n\n1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:35.840\n but because it's not coordinated,\n\n1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:38.080\n because it doesn't have the deep, in the millennial sense,\n\n1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:40.960\n the hierarchical structure that the brain does,\n\n1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:45.800\n there is no overall mode or pattern or organization\n\n1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:48.160\n that expresses itself on the surface\n\n1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:50.080\n that allows it to actually swim.\n\n1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:54.080\n It can certainly have a very active surface,\n\n1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.280\n but en masse, at the scale of the actual surface of the Sun,\n\n1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:02.920\n the average position of that surface cannot, in itself, move,\n\n1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:06.680\n because the internal dynamics are more like a hot gas.\n\n1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:08.480\n They are literally like a hot gas,\n\n1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:11.440\n whereas your internal dynamics are much more structured\n\n1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:12.880\n and deeply structured,\n\n1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:16.440\n and now you can express on your active states\n\n1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:19.720\n with your muscles and your secretory organs,\n\n1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:22.920\n your autonomic nervous system and its effectors,\n\n1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:26.760\n you can actually move, and that's all you can do.\n\n1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:28.240\n And that's something which,\n\n1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:30.440\n if you haven't thought of it like this before,\n\n1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:32.440\n I think it's nice to just realize\n\n1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:37.040\n there is no other way that you can change the universe\n\n1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:39.240\n other than simply moving.\n\n1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:43.840\n Whether that moving is articulating with my voice box\n\n1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:46.600\n or walking around or squeezing juices\n\n1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:48.720\n out of my secretory organs,\n\n1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:51.960\n there's only one way you can change the universe.\n\n1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:53.240\n It's moving.\n\n1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:58.600\n And the fact that you do so nonrandomly makes you alive.\n\n1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:00.600\n Yeah, so it's that nonrandomness.\n\n1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:04.840\n And that would be manifested,\n\n1:05:04.840 --> 1:05:07.800\n we realize, in terms of essentially swimming,\n\n1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:10.480\n essentially moving, changing one's shape,\n\n1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:15.760\n a morphogenesis that is dynamic and possibly adaptive.\n\n1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:17.920\n So that's what I was trying to get at\n\n1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:19.160\n between the difference between the oil drop\n\n1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:21.000\n and the little tadpole.\n\n1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000\n The tadpole is moving around.\n\n1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:26.920\n Its active states are actually changing the external states.\n\n1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:28.480\n And there's now a cycle,\n\n1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:30.400\n an action perception cycle, if you like,\n\n1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:34.040\n a recurrent dynamic that's going on\n\n1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:39.360\n that depends upon this deeply structured autonomous behavior\n\n1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:44.600\n that rests upon internal dynamics\n\n1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:48.880\n that are not only modeling\n\n1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:53.800\n the data impressed upon their surface or the blanket states,\n\n1:05:53.800 --> 1:05:58.800\n but they are actively resampling those data by moving.\n\n1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:03.920\n They're moving towards chemical gradients and chemotaxis.\n\n1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:08.280\n So they've gone beyond just being good little models\n\n1:06:08.280 --> 1:06:11.120\n of the kind of world they live in.\n\n1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:15.960\n For example, an oil droplet could, in a panpsychic sense,\n\n1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:18.440\n be construed as a little being\n\n1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:20.720\n that has now perfectly inferred.\n\n1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:23.800\n It's a passive, nonliving oil drop\n\n1:06:23.800 --> 1:06:25.600\n living in a bowl of water.\n\n1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.960\n No problem.\n\n1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:31.040\n But to now equip that oil drop with the ability to go out\n\n1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:34.040\n and test that hypothesis about different states of beings.\n\n1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:36.920\n So it can actually push its surface over there, over there,\n\n1:06:36.920 --> 1:06:38.680\n and test for chemical gradients,\n\n1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:42.880\n or then you start to move to a much more lifelike form.\n\n1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:44.920\n This is all fun, theoretically interesting,\n\n1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:47.000\n but it actually is quite important\n\n1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.800\n in terms of reflecting what I have seen\n\n1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:53.120\n since the turn of the millennium,\n\n1:06:53.120 --> 1:06:56.600\n which is this move towards an inactive\n\n1:06:56.600 --> 1:07:00.760\n and embodied understanding of intelligence.\n\n1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.760\n And you say you're from machine learning.\n\n1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:05.720\n So what that means,\n\n1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:10.680\n the central importance of movement,\n\n1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:14.000\n I think has yet to really hit machine learning.\n\n1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:20.400\n It certainly has now diffused itself throughout robotics.\n\n1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:23.200\n And perhaps you could say certain problems in active vision\n\n1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:25.360\n where you actually have to move the camera\n\n1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:27.240\n to sample this and that.\n\n1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:31.600\n But machine learning of the data mining deep learning sort\n\n1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:34.000\n simply hasn't contended with this issue.\n\n1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.240\n What it's done, instead of dealing with the movement problem\n\n1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:39.160\n and the active sampling of data,\n\n1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:40.720\n it's just said, we don't need to worry about,\n\n1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:43.120\n we can see all the data because we've got big data.\n\n1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:45.120\n So we can ignore movement.\n\n1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:50.920\n So that for me is an important omission\n\n1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:52.200\n in current machine learning.\n\n1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:54.800\n The current machine learning is much more like the oil drop.\n\n1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:55.960\n Yes.\n\n1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:59.480\n But an oil drop that enjoys exposure\n\n1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:03.600\n to nearly all the data that it will ever need to be exposed to,\n\n1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:05.760\n as opposed to the tadpoles swimming out\n\n1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:07.360\n to find the right data.\n\n1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:10.320\n For example, it likes food.\n\n1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:11.240\n That's a good hypothesis.\n\n1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:12.080\n Let's test it out.\n\n1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:15.720\n Let's go and move and ingest food, for example,\n\n1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:18.680\n and see is that evidence that I'm the kind of thing\n\n1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:20.400\n that likes this kind of food.\n\n1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:24.000\n So the next natural question, and forgive this question,\n\n1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:27.120\n but if we think of sort of even artificial intelligence\n\n1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:29.440\n systems, which I just painted a beautiful picture\n\n1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:32.840\n of existence and life.\n\n1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:39.920\n So do you ascribe, do you find within this framework\n\n1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:45.240\n a possibility of defining consciousness\n\n1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:47.360\n or exploring the idea of consciousness?\n\n1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:52.760\n Like what, you know, self awareness\n\n1:08:52.760 --> 1:08:55.160\n and expand it to consciousness?\n\n1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:56.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:58.840\n How can we start to think about consciousness\n\n1:08:58.840 --> 1:08:59.720\n within this framework?\n\n1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:00.920\n Is it possible?\n\n1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:03.160\n Well, yeah, I think it's possible to think about it,\n\n1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:04.320\n whether you'll get it.\n\n1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:06.400\n Get anywhere is another question.\n\n1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:10.320\n And again, I'm not sure that I'm licensed\n\n1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:12.760\n to answer that question.\n\n1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:15.120\n I think you'd have to speak to a qualified philosopher\n\n1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:17.320\n to get a definitive answer to that.\n\n1:09:17.320 --> 1:09:19.680\n But certainly, there's a lot of interest\n\n1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:23.400\n in using not just these ideas, but related ideas\n\n1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:27.960\n from information theory to try and tie down\n\n1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:34.080\n the maths and the calculus and the geometry of consciousness,\n\n1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:39.720\n either in terms of sort of a minimal consciousness,\n\n1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:42.440\n even less than a minimal selfhood.\n\n1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:48.320\n And what I'm talking about is the ability, effectively,\n\n1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:52.440\n to plan, to have agency.\n\n1:09:52.440 --> 1:09:57.760\n So you could argue that a virus does have a form of agency\n\n1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:00.360\n in virtue of the way that it selectively\n\n1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:05.880\n finds hosts and cells to live in and moves around.\n\n1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:09.280\n But you wouldn't endow it with the capacity\n\n1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:14.880\n to think about planning and moving in a purposeful way\n\n1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:17.280\n where it countenances the future.\n\n1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:18.680\n Whereas you might an ant.\n\n1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:22.040\n You might think an ant's not quite as unconscious\n\n1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:24.280\n as a virus.\n\n1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:26.160\n It certainly seems to have a purpose.\n\n1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:29.680\n It talks to its friends en route during its foraging.\n\n1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:37.160\n It has a different kind of autonomy, which is biotic,\n\n1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:38.720\n but beyond a virus.\n\n1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:41.400\n So there's something about, so there's\n\n1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:45.680\n some line that has to do with the complexity of planning\n\n1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:48.000\n that may contain an answer.\n\n1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.960\n I mean, it would be beautiful if we\n\n1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:55.480\n can find a line beyond which we could say a being is conscious.\n\n1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:56.560\n Yes, it will be.\n\n1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:00.800\n These are wonderful lines that we've drawn with existence,\n\n1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:02.680\n life, and consciousness.\n\n1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:05.320\n Yes, it will be very nice.\n\n1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:07.280\n One little wrinkle there, and this\n\n1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:09.400\n is something I've only learned in the past few months,\n\n1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:12.400\n is the philosophical notion of vagueness.\n\n1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:14.840\n So you're saying it would be wonderful to draw a line.\n\n1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:18.080\n I had always assumed that that line at some point\n\n1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:22.720\n would be drawn until about four months ago,\n\n1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.880\n and the philosopher taught me about vagueness.\n\n1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.720\n So I don't know if you've come across this,\n\n1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:28.440\n but it's a technical concept.\n\n1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:33.480\n And I think most revealingly illustrated with,\n\n1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:37.120\n at what point does a pile of sand become a pile?\n\n1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:41.620\n Is it one grain, two grains, three grains, or four grains?\n\n1:11:41.620 --> 1:11:44.200\n So at what point would you draw the line\n\n1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:51.320\n between being a pile of sand and a collection of grains of sand?\n\n1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:53.520\n In the same way, is it right to ask,\n\n1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:55.560\n where would I draw the line between conscious\n\n1:11:55.560 --> 1:11:56.740\n and unconscious?\n\n1:11:56.740 --> 1:11:59.680\n And it might be a vague concept.\n\n1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:02.920\n Having said that, I agree with you entirely.\n\n1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:06.480\n Systems that have the ability to plan.\n\n1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:08.440\n So just technically, what that means\n\n1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:13.880\n is your inferential self evidencing,\n\n1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:19.880\n by which I simply mean the thermodynamics and gradient\n\n1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:22.960\n flows that underwrite the preservation of your oil\n\n1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:29.080\n droplet like form, can be described\n\n1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:32.560\n as an optimization of log Bayesian model\n\n1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:36.680\n evidence, your elbow.\n\n1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:39.760\n That self evidencing must be evidence\n\n1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:44.000\n for a model of what's causing the sensory impressions\n\n1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.040\n on the sensory part of your surface or your Markov\n\n1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.520\n blanket.\n\n1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:51.160\n If that model is capable of planning,\n\n1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:53.800\n it must include a model of the future consequences\n\n1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.800\n of your active states or your action, just planning.\n\n1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:59.200\n So we're now in the game of planning as inference.\n\n1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:00.620\n Now notice what we've made, though.\n\n1:13:00.620 --> 1:13:04.400\n We've made quite a big move away from big data and machine\n\n1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:08.520\n learning, because again, it's the consequences of moving.\n\n1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:11.600\n It's the consequences of selecting those data or those\n\n1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:14.240\n data or looking over there.\n\n1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:17.420\n And that tells you immediately that even\n\n1:13:17.420 --> 1:13:22.760\n to be a contender for a conscious artifact or a strong\n\n1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:26.760\n AI or generalized, I don't know what that's called nowadays,\n\n1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:29.280\n then you've got to have movement in the game.\n\n1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:32.560\n And furthermore, you've got to have a generative model\n\n1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:34.920\n of the sort you might find in, say, a variational auto\n\n1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:39.840\n encoder that is thinking about the future conditioned\n\n1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:41.900\n upon different courses of action.\n\n1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:44.400\n Now that brings a number of things to the table, which\n\n1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:46.280\n now you start to think, well, those\n\n1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:47.400\n have got all the right ingredients\n\n1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:48.640\n to talk about consciousness.\n\n1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:51.600\n I've now got to select among a number of different courses\n\n1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:54.920\n of action into the future as part of planning.\n\n1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:56.440\n I've now got free will.\n\n1:13:56.440 --> 1:13:59.440\n The act of selecting this course of action or that policy\n\n1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:02.480\n or that policy or that action suddenly\n\n1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:04.720\n makes me into an inference machine,\n\n1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:09.480\n a self evidencing artifact that now\n\n1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:12.480\n looks as if it's selecting amongst different alternative\n\n1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:15.480\n ways forward, as I actively swim here or swim there\n\n1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:17.920\n or look over here, look over there.\n\n1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:19.920\n So I think you've now got to a situation\n\n1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:22.240\n if there is planning in the mix.\n\n1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:25.200\n You're now getting much closer to that line\n\n1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:27.360\n if that line were ever to exist.\n\n1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:32.400\n I don't think it gets you quite as far as self aware, though.\n\n1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:39.680\n And then you have to, I think, grapple with the question,\n\n1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:43.160\n how would formally write down a calculus or a maths\n\n1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:44.620\n of self awareness?\n\n1:14:44.620 --> 1:14:47.840\n I don't think it's impossible to do.\n\n1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:51.400\n But I think there would be pressure on you\n\n1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:53.360\n to actually commit to a formal definition of what\n\n1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:55.920\n you mean by self awareness.\n\n1:14:55.920 --> 1:15:00.480\n I think most people that I know would probably\n\n1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:07.000\n say that a goldfish, a pet fish, was not self aware.\n\n1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.600\n They would probably argue about their favorite cat,\n\n1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:14.000\n but would be quite happy to say that their mom was self aware.\n\n1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:15.480\n So.\n\n1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:17.400\n I mean, but that might very well connect\n\n1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:20.960\n to some level of complexity with planning.\n\n1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:26.520\n It seems like self awareness is essential for complex planning.\n\n1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:27.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:28.080\n Do you want to take that further?\n\n1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:29.880\n Because I think you're absolutely right.\n\n1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:31.400\n Again, the line is unclear, but it\n\n1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:36.400\n seems like integrating yourself into the world,\n\n1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:42.320\n into your planning, is essential for constructing complex plans.\n\n1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:43.080\n Yes.\n\n1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:43.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:47.440\n So mathematically describing that in the same elegant way\n\n1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:51.120\n as you have with the free energy principle might be difficult.\n\n1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:53.360\n Well, yes and no.\n\n1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:55.360\n I don't think that, well, perhaps we should just,\n\n1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:57.000\n can we just go back?\n\n1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.720\n That's a very important answer you gave.\n\n1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:01.880\n And I think if I just unpacked it,\n\n1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:06.480\n you'd see the truisms that you've just exposed for us.\n\n1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:10.400\n But let me, sorry, I'm mindful that I didn't answer\n\n1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:11.360\n your question before.\n\n1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:13.880\n Well, what's the free energy principle good for?\n\n1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:15.680\n Is it just a pretty theoretical exercise\n\n1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:17.880\n to explain nonequilibrium steady states?\n\n1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:19.400\n Yes, it is.\n\n1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:21.360\n It does nothing more for you than that.\n\n1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:24.040\n It can be regarded, it's going to sound very arrogant,\n\n1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:27.880\n but it is of the sort of theory of natural selection,\n\n1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:32.800\n or a hypothesis of natural selection.\n\n1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:37.200\n Beautiful, undeniably true, but tells you\n\n1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:42.040\n absolutely nothing about why you have legs and eyes.\n\n1:16:42.040 --> 1:16:44.720\n It tells you nothing about the actual phenotype,\n\n1:16:44.720 --> 1:16:48.080\n and it wouldn't allow you to build something.\n\n1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:51.120\n So the free energy principle by itself\n\n1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:54.880\n is as vacuous as most tautological theories.\n\n1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:56.200\n And by tautological, of course,\n\n1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:58.800\n I'm talking to the theory of natural,\n\n1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:00.080\n the survival of the fittest.\n\n1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.760\n What's the fittest of those that survive?\n\n1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:02.600\n Why do they cycle?\n\n1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:03.440\n It's the fitter.\n\n1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:05.640\n It just goes around in circles.\n\n1:17:05.640 --> 1:17:08.560\n In a sense, the free energy principle has that same\n\n1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:11.480\n deflationary tautology under the hood.\n\n1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.680\n It's a characteristic of things that exist.\n\n1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:18.520\n Why do they exist?\n\n1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:19.720\n Because they minimize their free energy.\n\n1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:21.400\n Why do they minimize their free energy?\n\n1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:22.440\n Because they exist.\n\n1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:24.720\n And you just keep on going round and round and round.\n\n1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:28.080\n But the practical thing,\n\n1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:32.680\n which you don't get from natural selection,\n\n1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:35.680\n but you could say has now manifest in things\n\n1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:38.160\n like differential evolution or genetic algorithms\n\n1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:41.320\n and MCMC, for example, in machine learning.\n\n1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:43.240\n The practical thing you can get is,\n\n1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:45.440\n if it looks as if things that exist\n\n1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:49.400\n are trying to have density dynamics\n\n1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:51.560\n and look as though they're optimizing\n\n1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:53.320\n a variational free energy,\n\n1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:55.200\n and a variational free energy has to be\n\n1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:57.280\n a functional of a generative model,\n\n1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:01.720\n a probabilistic description of causes and consequences,\n\n1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.560\n causes out there, consequences in the sensorium\n\n1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:07.080\n on the sensory parts of the Markov blanket,\n\n1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:08.680\n then it should, in theory, be possible\n\n1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:10.400\n to write down the generative model,\n\n1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:11.840\n work out the gradients,\n\n1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:15.920\n and then cause it to autonomously self evidence.\n\n1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:18.160\n So you should be able to write down oil droplets.\n\n1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:20.080\n You should be able to create artifacts\n\n1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:24.240\n where you have supplied the objective function\n\n1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:25.560\n that supplies the gradients,\n\n1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:28.320\n that supplies the self organizing dynamics\n\n1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:30.280\n to non equilibrium steady state.\n\n1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:32.680\n So there is actually a practical application\n\n1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:34.120\n of the free energy principle\n\n1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:37.800\n when you can write down your required evidence\n\n1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:40.400\n in terms of, well, when you can write down\n\n1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:43.720\n the generative model that is the thing\n\n1:18:43.720 --> 1:18:44.800\n that has the evidence.\n\n1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:46.760\n The probability of these sensory data\n\n1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:50.880\n or this data, given that model,\n\n1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:54.200\n is effectively the thing that the elbow\n\n1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:57.400\n or the variational free energy bounds or approximates.\n\n1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:00.800\n That means that you can actually write down the model\n\n1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:04.640\n and the kind of thing that you want to engineer,\n\n1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.840\n the kind of AGI or artificial general intelligence\n\n1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:14.480\n that you want to manifest probabilistically,\n\n1:19:14.480 --> 1:19:16.720\n and then you engineer, a lot of hard work,\n\n1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:19.760\n but you would engineer a robot and a computer\n\n1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.400\n to perform a gradient descent on that objective function.\n\n1:19:23.400 --> 1:19:26.160\n So it does have a practical implication.\n\n1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:27.440\n Now, why am I wittering on about that?\n\n1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:28.880\n It did seem relevant to, yes.\n\n1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:32.920\n So what kinds of, so the answer to,\n\n1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:34.240\n would it be easier or would it be hard?\n\n1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.200\n Well, mathematically, it's easy.\n\n1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:38.000\n I've just told you all you need to do\n\n1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:43.000\n is write down your perfect artifact,\n\n1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:45.280\n probabilistically, in the form\n\n1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:46.480\n of a probabilistic generative model,\n\n1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:48.800\n a probability distribution over the causes\n\n1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:52.520\n and consequences of the world\n\n1:19:52.520 --> 1:19:54.680\n in which this thing is immersed.\n\n1:19:54.680 --> 1:19:58.040\n And then you just engineer a computer and a robot\n\n1:19:58.040 --> 1:20:00.800\n to perform a gradient descent on that objective function.\n\n1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:01.640\n No problem.\n\n1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:04.160\n But of course, the big problem\n\n1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:05.960\n is writing down the generative model.\n\n1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:08.040\n So that's where the heavy lifting comes in.\n\n1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:12.160\n So it's the form and the structure of that generative model\n\n1:20:12.160 --> 1:20:15.640\n which basically defines the artifact that you will create\n\n1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:19.600\n or, indeed, the kind of artifact that has self awareness.\n\n1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:22.080\n So that's where all the hard work comes,\n\n1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:24.640\n very much like natural selection doesn't tell you\n\n1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:27.000\n in the slightest why you have eyes.\n\n1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.480\n So you have to drill down on the actual phenotype,\n\n1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:31.480\n the actual generative model.\n\n1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:36.360\n So with that in mind, what did you tell me\n\n1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:40.720\n that tells me immediately the kinds of generative models\n\n1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:43.480\n I would have to write down in order to have self awareness?\n\n1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:48.200\n What you said to me was I have to have a model\n\n1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:50.440\n that is effectively fit for purpose\n\n1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:53.680\n for this kind of world in which I operate.\n\n1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:55.880\n And if I now make the observation\n\n1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:59.120\n that this kind of world is effectively largely populated\n\n1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:01.360\n by other things like me, i.e. you,\n\n1:21:02.360 --> 1:21:04.200\n then it makes enormous sense\n\n1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:07.280\n that if I can develop a hypothesis\n\n1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:11.520\n that we are similar kinds of creatures,\n\n1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:13.640\n in fact, the same kind of creature,\n\n1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:16.320\n but I am me and you are you,\n\n1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:21.320\n then it becomes, again, mandated to have a sense of self.\n\n1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:23.640\n So if I live in a world\n\n1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:26.560\n that is constituted by things like me,\n\n1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:29.520\n basically a social world, a community,\n\n1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:32.320\n then it becomes necessary now for me to infer\n\n1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:34.400\n that it's me talking and not you talking.\n\n1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:37.280\n I wouldn't need that if I was on Mars by myself\n\n1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.040\n or if I was in the jungle as a feral child.\n\n1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:43.120\n If there was nothing like me around,\n\n1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:46.200\n there would be no need to have an inference\n\n1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:49.160\n at a hypothesis, oh yes, it is me\n\n1:21:49.160 --> 1:21:51.240\n that is experiencing or causing these sounds\n\n1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:52.360\n and it is not you.\n\n1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:54.680\n It's only when there's ambiguity in play\n\n1:21:54.680 --> 1:21:58.240\n induced by the fact that there are others in that world.\n\n1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:03.240\n So I think that the special thing about self aware artifacts\n\n1:22:03.520 --> 1:22:08.280\n is that they have learned to, or they have acquired,\n\n1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:11.680\n or at least are equipped with, possibly by evolution,\n\n1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:14.560\n generative models that allow for the fact\n\n1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:17.360\n there are lots of copies of things like them around,\n\n1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:20.600\n and therefore they have to work out it's you and not me.\n\n1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:23.280\n That's brilliant.\n\n1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:24.560\n I've never thought of that.\n\n1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:28.160\n I never thought of that, that the purpose\n\n1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:31.360\n of the really usefulness of consciousness\n\n1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:34.200\n or self awareness in the context of planning\n\n1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.920\n existing in the world is so you can operate\n\n1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:39.240\n with other things like you, and like you could,\n\n1:22:39.240 --> 1:22:40.800\n it doesn't have to necessarily be human.\n\n1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:43.480\n It could be other kind of similar creatures.\n\n1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:46.080\n Absolutely, well, we view a lot of our attributes\n\n1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:47.880\n into our pets, don't we?\n\n1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:49.920\n Or we try to make our robots humanoid.\n\n1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:51.840\n And I think there's a deep reason for that,\n\n1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:54.680\n that it's just much easier to read the world\n\n1:22:54.680 --> 1:22:56.240\n if you can make the simplifying assumption\n\n1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:00.040\n that basically you're me, and it's just your turn to talk.\n\n1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:01.520\n I mean, when we talk about planning,\n\n1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:04.200\n when you talk specifically about planning,\n\n1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:07.800\n the highest, if you like, manifestation or realization\n\n1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:09.600\n of that planning is what we're doing now.\n\n1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:12.560\n I mean, the human condition doesn't get any higher\n\n1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:16.800\n than this talking about the philosophy of existence\n\n1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:17.920\n and the conversation.\n\n1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:22.920\n But in that conversation, there is a beautiful art\n\n1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:28.120\n of turn taking and mutual inference, theory of mind.\n\n1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:29.680\n I have to know when you wanna listen.\n\n1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:31.120\n I have to know when you want to interrupt.\n\n1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:32.520\n I have to make sure that you're online.\n\n1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:34.360\n I have to have a model in my head\n\n1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:35.800\n of your model in your head.\n\n1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:38.320\n That's the highest, the most sophisticated form\n\n1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:40.160\n of generative model, where the generative model\n\n1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:41.360\n actually has a generative model\n\n1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:42.800\n of somebody else's generative model.\n\n1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:47.080\n And I think that, and what we are doing now evinces\n\n1:23:47.080 --> 1:23:49.160\n the kinds of generative models\n\n1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:51.280\n that would support self awareness,\n\n1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:54.640\n because without that, we'd both be talking over each other,\n\n1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:57.440\n or we'd be singing together in a choir.\n\n1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:01.280\n That's not a brilliant analogy for what I'm trying to say,\n\n1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:05.160\n but yeah, we wouldn't have this discourse.\n\n1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:06.000\n We wouldn't have this.\n\n1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:06.840\n Yeah, the dance of it.\n\n1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:07.680\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:12.680\n As I interrupt, I mean, that's beautifully put.\n\n1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:17.360\n I'll re listen to this conversation many times.\n\n1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:21.600\n There's so much poetry in this, and mathematics.\n\n1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:26.240\n Let me ask the silliest, or perhaps the biggest question\n\n1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:28.880\n as a last kind of question.\n\n1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:33.360\n We've talked about living in existence\n\n1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:35.120\n and the objective function under which\n\n1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:37.480\n these objects would operate.\n\n1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:39.720\n What do you think is the objective function\n\n1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:41.560\n of our existence?\n\n1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:44.160\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:47.160\n What do you think is the, for you, perhaps,\n\n1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:50.200\n the purpose, the source of fulfillment,\n\n1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:53.080\n the source of meaning for your existence,\n\n1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:57.640\n as one blob in this soup?\n\n1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:00.480\n I'm tempted to answer that, again, as a physicist,\n\n1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:03.040\n until it's the free energy I expect\n\n1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:05.480\n consequent upon my behavior.\n\n1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:08.400\n So technically, we could get a really interesting\n\n1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:10.720\n conversation about what that comprises\n\n1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:13.160\n in terms of searching for information,\n\n1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:16.560\n resolving uncertainty about the kind of thing that I am.\n\n1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:20.240\n But I suspect that you want a slightly more personal\n\n1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:25.120\n and fun answer, but which can be consistent with that.\n\n1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:30.120\n And I think it's reassuringly simple\n\n1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:35.320\n and hops back to what you were taught as a child,\n\n1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:39.520\n that you have certain beliefs about the kind of creature\n\n1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:41.840\n and the kind of person you are.\n\n1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:44.840\n And all that self evidencing means,\n\n1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:46.840\n all that minimizing variational free energy\n\n1:25:46.840 --> 1:25:50.000\n in an inactive and embodied way,\n\n1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.640\n means is fulfilling the beliefs about\n\n1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:55.720\n what kind of thing you are.\n\n1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:58.040\n And of course, we're all given those scripts,\n\n1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:01.240\n those narratives, at a very early age,\n\n1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:04.280\n usually in the form of bedtime stories or fairy stories\n\n1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:07.160\n that I'm a princess and I'm gonna meet a beast\n\n1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:09.360\n who's gonna transform and he's gonna be a prince.\n\n1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:11.880\n And so the narratives are all around you\n\n1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:14.560\n from your parents to the friends\n\n1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:17.680\n to the society feeds these stories.\n\n1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:21.000\n And then your objective function is to fulfill.\n\n1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:24.240\n Exactly, that narrative that has been encultured\n\n1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:27.160\n by your immediate family, but as you say,\n\n1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:29.600\n also the sort of the culture in which you grew up\n\n1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:30.880\n and you create for yourself.\n\n1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:33.440\n I mean, again, because of this active inference,\n\n1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:36.680\n this inactive aspect of self evidencing,\n\n1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:40.960\n not only am I modeling my environment,\n\n1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:44.040\n my eco niche, my external states out there,\n\n1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:46.520\n but I'm actively changing them all the time\n\n1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:49.840\n and doing the same back, we're doing it together.\n\n1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:53.680\n So there's a synchrony that means that I'm creating\n\n1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:56.800\n my own culture over different timescales.\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:00.800\n So the question now is for me being very selfish,\n\n1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:02.240\n what scripts were I given?\n\n1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:06.160\n It basically was a mixture between Einstein and shark homes.\n\n1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:08.840\n So I smoke as heavily as possible,\n\n1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:12.560\n try to avoid too much interpersonal contact,\n\n1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:20.280\n enjoy the fantasy that you're a popular scientist\n\n1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.400\n who's gonna make a difference in a slightly quirky way.\n\n1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:25.200\n So that's what I grew up on.\n\n1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:28.320\n My father was an engineer and loved science\n\n1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:33.320\n and he loved sort of things like Sir Arthur Edmonds,\n\n1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:37.440\n Spacetime and Gravitation, which was the first\n\n1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:40.800\n understandable version of general relativity.\n\n1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:45.840\n So all the fairy stories I was told as I was growing up\n\n1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:47.680\n were all about these characters.\n\n1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:50.600\n I'm keeping the Hobbit out of this\n\n1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:53.280\n because that doesn't quite fit my narrative.\n\n1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:56.240\n There's a journey of exploration, I suppose, of sorts.\n\n1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:01.240\n So yeah, I've just grown up to be what I imagine\n\n1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:05.720\n a mild mannered Sherlock Holmes slash Albert Einstein\n\n1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:07.960\n would do in my shoes.\n\n1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:10.080\n And you did it
