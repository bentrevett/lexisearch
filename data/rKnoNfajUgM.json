00:07.940\n But if you're playing with the other six, you're the sucker.\n\n00:07.940 --> 00:10.820\n You are like the worst player in the game, right?\n\n00:10.820 --> 00:13.580\n So like there's a lot of players, for example,\n\n00:13.580 --> 00:15.420\n like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?\n\n00:15.420 --> 00:17.580\n He's not a top level player,\n\n00:17.580 --> 00:19.500\n like these guys you see on TV,\n\n00:19.500 --> 00:21.620\n but he probably makes more money than they do\n\n00:21.620 --> 00:23.040\n because he plays with people\n\n00:23.040 --> 00:24.660\n that are far below his skill level.\n\n00:24.660 --> 00:27.220\n So part of the skill of being a poker player\n\n00:27.220 --> 00:30.600\n is finding situations where you're profitable,\n\n00:30.600 --> 00:32.100\n regardless of your skill level.\n\n00:34.360 --> 00:37.580\n The following is a conversation with Daniel Negrano,\n\n00:37.580 --> 00:40.520\n one of the greatest poker players of all time.\n\n00:40.520 --> 00:42.440\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:42.440 --> 00:44.460\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:44.460 --> 00:45.700\n in the description.\n\n00:45.700 --> 00:49.280\n And now, dear friends, here's Daniel Negrano.\n\n00:50.180 --> 00:52.060\n Everything everyone does at the poker table\n\n00:52.060 --> 00:53.220\n conveys information.\n\n00:53.220 --> 00:56.460\n So let me ask sort of the big overview question.\n\n00:56.460 --> 00:59.060\n What are the various sources of information\n\n00:59.060 --> 01:02.300\n that you project and others project at the table\n\n01:02.300 --> 01:03.980\n that convey information?\n\n01:03.980 --> 01:05.220\n Well, there's several different things.\n\n01:05.220 --> 01:06.560\n There's the ones that are conscious\n\n01:06.560 --> 01:08.680\n and then there's the ones that are subconscious, right?\n\n01:08.680 --> 01:09.880\n Like on the conscious level,\n\n01:09.880 --> 01:11.940\n it might be something someone says, right?\n\n01:11.940 --> 01:13.780\n You know, you ask them a question and they say,\n\n01:13.780 --> 01:15.980\n oh, you know, you shouldn't call me here, you should.\n\n01:15.980 --> 01:17.440\n So there's the verbal tells.\n\n01:17.440 --> 01:20.140\n There's also the more, you know, subconscious stuff,\n\n01:20.140 --> 01:21.860\n body posture, right?\n\n01:21.860 --> 01:24.820\n The eyes, the throat, the pulse,\n\n01:24.820 --> 01:27.900\n various things that are, you know, less controllable.\n\n01:27.900 --> 01:30.040\n I find I use a combination of both\n\n01:30.040 --> 01:31.580\n to try to gain information,\n\n01:31.580 --> 01:34.840\n but generally when I have somebody more comfortable,\n\n01:34.840 --> 01:36.360\n they give off more.\n\n01:36.360 --> 01:37.700\n Like everyone has a different approach.\n\n01:37.700 --> 01:39.540\n Phil Ivey likes to intimidate.\n\n01:39.540 --> 01:40.420\n I go the other way.\n\n01:40.420 --> 01:42.700\n I want my opponents to be relaxed\n\n01:42.700 --> 01:44.580\n so that they'll give me more in that regard.\n\n01:44.580 --> 01:47.260\n So Phil Ivey likes to perturb the system,\n\n01:47.260 --> 01:50.500\n like mess with it to see what comes out.\n\n01:50.500 --> 01:52.460\n I think Phil has an aura about him\n\n01:52.460 --> 01:55.820\n where he wants you to know that he's watching you,\n\n01:55.820 --> 01:58.020\n be afraid, be uncomfortable,\n\n01:58.020 --> 02:00.780\n because when you're uncomfortable, I got you, right?\n\n02:00.780 --> 02:03.100\n And that's sort of his shtick where he, you know,\n\n02:03.100 --> 02:05.700\n and people do, like when you sit at a table with Phil Ivey,\n\n02:05.700 --> 02:06.540\n it's intimidating.\n\n02:06.540 --> 02:07.780\n He likes to rule by fear\n\n02:07.780 --> 02:10.040\n and you like to rule by, what is it, love?\n\n02:10.040 --> 02:11.220\n That's a really good way to put it.\n\n02:11.220 --> 02:12.740\n I never had anyone put it like that,\n\n02:12.740 --> 02:13.640\n but it makes a lot of sense.\n\n02:13.640 --> 02:15.500\n Yeah, you know, fear Phil Ivey,\n\n02:15.500 --> 02:17.220\n and then with me, it's fine, don't worry,\n\n02:17.220 --> 02:18.940\n I'll take your money, but you're gonna enjoy it.\n\n02:18.940 --> 02:19.820\n It's great.\n\n02:19.820 --> 02:21.820\n So that's what the talking at the table is about,\n\n02:21.820 --> 02:26.820\n is getting to be relaxed and get some of that gray area\n\n02:26.820 --> 02:28.420\n between the conscious and the subconscious\n\n02:28.420 --> 02:29.380\n to reveal something.\n\n02:29.380 --> 02:31.140\n Yeah, there's that too, and also just, you know,\n\n02:31.140 --> 02:32.680\n and this is just part of who I am anyway,\n\n02:32.680 --> 02:34.060\n like I like to talk to people,\n\n02:34.060 --> 02:36.540\n but one of the byproducts is the more I know about you,\n\n02:36.540 --> 02:38.280\n the more I likely know about how you think\n\n02:38.280 --> 02:39.720\n about different situations, right?\n\n02:39.720 --> 02:40.580\n So what do you do for a living?\n\n02:40.580 --> 02:42.980\n Oh, I'm a lawyer, I defend criminals.\n\n02:42.980 --> 02:45.540\n Okay, so this guy probably spends a lot of his time\n\n02:45.540 --> 02:47.820\n twisting the truth, trying to find, you know,\n\n02:47.820 --> 02:50.340\n and then, so then, you know, you already have a mindset\n\n02:50.340 --> 02:52.020\n of like, this guy might be more likely to bluff\n\n02:52.020 --> 02:53.620\n or he's probably comfortable doing that.\n\n02:53.620 --> 02:55.300\n Very subtle things like that.\n\n02:55.300 --> 03:00.040\n And you start to pick up cues on what nervousness looks like\n\n03:00.040 --> 03:02.780\n for this person, what the nervousness communicates,\n\n03:02.780 --> 03:03.620\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n03:03.620 --> 03:05.620\n So we're talking about physical tells here.\n\n03:05.620 --> 03:07.460\n Yeah, physical tells is a secondary thing.\n\n03:07.460 --> 03:10.500\n I was more specific like player profiling, right?\n\n03:10.500 --> 03:12.180\n And sort of understanding the type of mind\n\n03:12.180 --> 03:14.300\n that I'm dealing with, right?\n\n03:14.300 --> 03:17.900\n So again, somebody who's a lawyer is used to trying,\n\n03:17.900 --> 03:21.420\n is fine with being deceptive as part of a game, right?\n\n03:21.420 --> 03:23.800\n Whereas maybe somebody who's a Sunday school teacher\n\n03:23.800 --> 03:25.820\n and, you know, they don't feel comfortable,\n\n03:25.820 --> 03:28.540\n maybe they think bluffing might be dishonest, right?\n\n03:28.540 --> 03:31.540\n So they're less likely to try some shenanigans against you.\n\n03:31.540 --> 03:33.340\n So, and then the other thing too is,\n\n03:33.340 --> 03:38.340\n what type of person is this in terms of their, you know,\n\n03:38.740 --> 03:40.060\n like view on life, right?\n\n03:40.060 --> 03:40.900\n Are they positive?\n\n03:40.900 --> 03:44.040\n Do they feel like things go their way or they're not, right?\n\n03:44.040 --> 03:46.420\n There's those people that always, well, of course I lost,\n\n03:46.420 --> 03:47.980\n I always lose with this hand.\n\n03:47.980 --> 03:50.220\n And those types of people you can manipulate\n\n03:50.220 --> 03:52.020\n because when a card comes,\n\n03:52.020 --> 03:54.700\n that you don't have them beat, right?\n\n03:54.700 --> 03:56.540\n But you can pretend because they'll believe it.\n\n03:56.540 --> 03:57.580\n Like, of course you beat me.\n\n03:57.580 --> 03:59.220\n So you bet all your chips against them,\n\n03:59.220 --> 04:00.600\n knowing that you can scare them\n\n04:00.600 --> 04:03.780\n because they already feel like they're gonna lose.\n\n04:03.780 --> 04:05.980\n The inherent, like the cynicism.\n\n04:05.980 --> 04:06.820\n Exactly.\n\n04:06.820 --> 04:08.360\n Cynicism is easier to play against\n\n04:08.360 --> 04:10.740\n because you can convince them that their cards suck.\n\n04:10.740 --> 04:12.660\n Yeah, when somebody believes that they're a loser\n\n04:12.660 --> 04:14.140\n or they're unlucky, right?\n\n04:14.140 --> 04:16.100\n And that bad things happen to them always\n\n04:16.100 --> 04:17.540\n and they never catch a break.\n\n04:17.540 --> 04:20.540\n Well, you know, you can just help them make it true.\n\n04:21.980 --> 04:24.900\n What do you think about the rounders Teddy KGB\n\n04:24.900 --> 04:26.980\n when he does the Oreo tell?\n\n04:26.980 --> 04:30.220\n Do players at the high level communicate that kind of stuff?\n\n04:30.220 --> 04:31.940\n Do you think it's realistic to be able to have a tell\n\n04:31.940 --> 04:34.460\n like this that's partially subconscious?\n\n04:34.460 --> 04:37.420\n So first of all, I love Brian Koppelman who made the film.\n\n04:37.420 --> 04:39.380\n And I think what they were going for\n\n04:39.380 --> 04:41.900\n is something obvious to the general public, right?\n\n04:41.900 --> 04:44.020\n Like, okay, it's very clear, you know, he eats the cookie,\n\n04:44.020 --> 04:46.060\n he doesn't eat the cookie and it means one or the other.\n\n04:46.060 --> 04:50.060\n At the highest levels, something that, you know, blatant,\n\n04:50.060 --> 04:51.000\n you're not gonna find.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:52.540\n You're gonna find a lot more subtle things,\n\n04:52.540 --> 04:55.420\n maybe with posture or timing or, you know,\n\n04:55.420 --> 04:56.380\n different things like that.\n\n04:56.380 --> 05:00.340\n But at the lower levels, you know, you might see some,\n\n05:00.340 --> 05:02.340\n you might see, you know, with a lot of people\n\n05:02.340 --> 05:03.940\n when they're in a hand and they've bet,\n\n05:03.940 --> 05:06.100\n whether they drink water in the hand\n\n05:06.100 --> 05:08.220\n is going to tell you something generally speaking.\n\n05:08.220 --> 05:09.980\n It's such an intimate part of the human experience\n\n05:09.980 --> 05:11.340\n that I feel like if you have food,\n\n05:11.340 --> 05:13.160\n you're gonna reveal something about yourself\n\n05:13.160 --> 05:14.340\n through the way you eat.\n\n05:14.340 --> 05:15.620\n I feel like that's a dangerous thing\n\n05:15.620 --> 05:16.460\n to have at the table.\n\n05:16.460 --> 05:18.260\n Well, the thing is, generally speaking,\n\n05:18.260 --> 05:20.120\n people don't eat food in the middle of a hand.\n\n05:20.120 --> 05:23.100\n Like they're not gonna bet and then just like grab a burger.\n\n05:23.100 --> 05:24.620\n What they will do though is, you know,\n\n05:24.620 --> 05:26.720\n they bet and it's up to you and then they're,\n\n05:26.720 --> 05:28.280\n whether they're, you know, uncomfortable\n\n05:28.280 --> 05:29.240\n or they do it unconsciously,\n\n05:29.240 --> 05:30.980\n they just want to do something\n\n05:30.980 --> 05:32.820\n to make themselves look relaxed or whatever.\n\n05:32.820 --> 05:34.420\n And then, you know, they grab a water\n\n05:34.420 --> 05:35.900\n where they don't really need it in that moment,\n\n05:35.900 --> 05:39.180\n but they're trying to take your mind off of the situation.\n\n05:39.180 --> 05:43.660\n So they, in the movie, wanted to show a simplistic version\n\n05:43.660 --> 05:45.180\n of something that does happen,\n\n05:45.180 --> 05:48.340\n something that's visually sort of clear.\n\n05:48.340 --> 05:50.760\n Yeah, because I think one of the things Rounders got right\n\n05:50.760 --> 05:52.340\n is that it's a poker movie, right?\n\n05:52.340 --> 05:54.100\n But you don't have to be great at poker\n\n05:54.100 --> 05:56.140\n or really understand poker to enjoy the movie.\n\n05:56.140 --> 05:58.220\n And that, you know, Oreo cookie tale,\n\n05:58.220 --> 05:59.820\n like everyone gets that.\n\n05:59.820 --> 06:01.180\n They're like, okay, that's simple.\n\n06:01.180 --> 06:03.180\n If he would have went with something more subtle,\n\n06:03.180 --> 06:06.600\n you know, like licking your lips or looking to the right,\n\n06:06.600 --> 06:09.020\n or I think it might've been lost on the audience.\n\n06:09.020 --> 06:12.120\n And they didn't actually explicitly say\n\n06:12.120 --> 06:14.940\n that that was a tell, I don't think.\n\n06:14.940 --> 06:17.700\n I thought they did everything to let you know, right?\n\n06:17.700 --> 06:21.340\n With the music and slow motion and he's staring at it\n\n06:21.340 --> 06:22.620\n and he's like, aha.\n\n06:22.620 --> 06:25.060\n Yeah, but they didn't actually say,\n\n06:25.060 --> 06:26.620\n you know, this is an obvious tell,\n\n06:26.620 --> 06:28.500\n like Matt Damon's character didn't talk.\n\n06:28.500 --> 06:29.940\n At the very end of it, you know,\n\n06:29.940 --> 06:33.500\n after he says, how the fuck did you lay that down?\n\n06:33.500 --> 06:34.620\n The monster, right?\n\n06:34.620 --> 06:37.900\n And he's like, he's like, you're not hungry?\n\n06:37.900 --> 06:38.740\n Not hungry, KGB?\n\n06:38.740 --> 06:40.300\n He's like, I keep on, but you, you know,\n\n06:40.300 --> 06:42.700\n so he sort of references it and then he takes the cookies.\n\n06:42.700 --> 06:44.500\n He notices, he's like, ah, he got me.\n\n06:44.500 --> 06:46.140\n And he breaks the, you know, the rack of cookies.\n\n06:46.140 --> 06:48.420\n Well, probably if you had that kind of tell on him,\n\n06:48.420 --> 06:51.540\n you wouldn't, and Matt Damon's character would not reveal.\n\n06:51.540 --> 06:53.420\n Well, he says in the movie, he says,\n\n06:53.420 --> 06:54.820\n normally I wouldn't reveal a tell,\n\n06:54.820 --> 06:56.620\n but I don't have that much time.\n\n06:56.620 --> 06:58.460\n Like I've got to rattle him some way.\n\n06:58.460 --> 07:00.620\n So that was one way to do that.\n\n07:00.620 --> 07:05.000\n How hard is it to do that to, in a KGB accent,\n\n07:05.900 --> 07:08.340\n to lay down a monster in those situations?\n\n07:08.340 --> 07:10.820\n In general, how hard is it to lay down\n\n07:10.820 --> 07:13.260\n a really strong hand, just psychologically?\n\n07:13.260 --> 07:15.140\n Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's incredibly difficult\n\n07:15.140 --> 07:16.680\n for the vast majority of people.\n\n07:16.680 --> 07:18.180\n You know, part of what makes professionals\n\n07:18.180 --> 07:20.660\n really, really good is recognizing a situation\n\n07:20.660 --> 07:22.860\n that's very, very dangerous and they need to, you know,\n\n07:22.860 --> 07:23.700\n jump ship.\n\n07:23.700 --> 07:25.260\n Like what happens to a lot of players\n\n07:25.260 --> 07:26.540\n is you get married to a hand.\n\n07:26.540 --> 07:27.900\n Let's say you have pocket aces,\n\n07:27.900 --> 07:29.780\n which is the best possible hand, right?\n\n07:29.780 --> 07:32.900\n But the board runs out where it's seven, eight, nine,\n\n07:32.900 --> 07:34.700\n and then there's a jack and then there's a six.\n\n07:34.700 --> 07:36.980\n It's like, you have a great hand to start,\n\n07:36.980 --> 07:37.860\n but you don't anymore.\n\n07:37.860 --> 07:41.540\n So one of the difficult things for the average player is,\n\n07:41.540 --> 07:44.740\n you know, once they've put money in, cutting their losses\n\n07:44.740 --> 07:46.680\n and saying, okay, let's move on to the next hand.\n\n07:46.680 --> 07:48.180\n It's a very, very difficult thing for a lot of people.\n\n07:48.180 --> 07:52.920\n At every stage of like pre flop all the way through,\n\n07:52.920 --> 07:55.700\n be able to just make a decision at that moment.\n\n07:55.700 --> 07:57.460\n So yeah, essentially not being attached.\n\n07:57.460 --> 08:00.500\n Okay, I've already put in $40,000 in this pot\n\n08:00.500 --> 08:02.260\n and this guy's bet another 20.\n\n08:02.260 --> 08:04.340\n Well, I mean, I gotta get my 40 back, right?\n\n08:04.340 --> 08:07.660\n Except, you know, in some cases you have to reassess\n\n08:07.660 --> 08:09.700\n individually this situation and realize,\n\n08:09.700 --> 08:11.100\n all right, well, this is a bad investment.\n\n08:11.100 --> 08:12.460\n So I got to cut my losses.\n\n08:12.460 --> 08:15.460\n By the way, I should mention that you have,\n\n08:15.460 --> 08:17.020\n you have an incredible YouTube channel\n\n08:17.020 --> 08:18.380\n where you explain a lot of stuff.\n\n08:18.380 --> 08:21.260\n You do a podcast, you do a lot of really awesome stuff.\n\n08:21.260 --> 08:23.660\n My probably favorite thing that you've done\n\n08:23.660 --> 08:27.340\n is your masterclass that people should definitely check out,\n\n08:27.340 --> 08:29.860\n masterclass.com slash Lux.\n\n08:29.860 --> 08:31.500\n There you go.\n\n08:31.500 --> 08:35.600\n No, but it really is one of my favorite masterclass courses,\n\n08:35.600 --> 08:38.580\n but also just a great introduction overview of poker.\n\n08:38.580 --> 08:42.620\n It's great for people like me who are beginners essentially,\n\n08:42.620 --> 08:44.420\n but it's probably really good for intermediate people too.\n\n08:44.420 --> 08:46.460\n I mean, there's a lot of really good detail there.\n\n08:46.460 --> 08:48.860\n Anyway, what are hand ranges\n\n08:48.860 --> 08:51.060\n and how do you begin to estimate the range of hands\n\n08:51.060 --> 08:52.260\n that your opponents have?\n\n08:52.260 --> 08:54.140\n Yeah, so I actually did, speaking to YouTube,\n\n08:54.140 --> 08:55.500\n I did a video on specifically this.\n\n08:55.500 --> 08:56.340\n Yes.\n\n08:56.340 --> 08:57.500\n Getting familiar with Rangers and essentially,\n\n08:57.500 --> 08:58.780\n you know, back in my day, the old days,\n\n08:58.780 --> 09:00.380\n we didn't talk about poker that way.\n\n09:00.380 --> 09:01.540\n We're like, I think he's got this\n\n09:01.540 --> 09:03.980\n or I think he's got that, right?\n\n09:03.980 --> 09:06.100\n Nobody thought of like the range of hands\n\n09:06.100 --> 09:06.940\n a player can have.\n\n09:06.940 --> 09:08.220\n So I guess the best example is,\n\n09:08.220 --> 09:09.820\n imagine like all the potential hands\n\n09:09.820 --> 09:11.820\n as being a part of a grid, right?\n\n09:11.820 --> 09:13.620\n So the first player to act,\n\n09:13.620 --> 09:16.180\n they could have any one of those hands, right?\n\n09:16.180 --> 09:18.100\n Anyone randomly dealt, right?\n\n09:18.100 --> 09:22.140\n But let's say now that that player raised to $3,000.\n\n09:22.140 --> 09:24.580\n Okay, well you can eliminate now from this grid,\n\n09:24.580 --> 09:27.200\n a whole bunch of hands that this player can no longer have\n\n09:27.200 --> 09:28.580\n because if they had a two and a three,\n\n09:28.580 --> 09:29.840\n they wouldn't do that.\n\n09:29.840 --> 09:32.500\n So you can say, okay, he probably has a big pair.\n\n09:32.500 --> 09:33.700\n He has ace king.\n\n09:33.700 --> 09:36.740\n You know, you've narrowed the range of hands down, right?\n\n09:36.740 --> 09:38.980\n Now through every action on the flop,\n\n09:38.980 --> 09:40.180\n on the turn and on the river,\n\n09:40.180 --> 09:41.820\n based on the decisions they make,\n\n09:41.820 --> 09:43.860\n you narrow it down even further.\n\n09:43.860 --> 09:45.860\n So the range of hands is the whole,\n\n09:46.940 --> 09:48.780\n the entirety of all the possibilities\n\n09:48.780 --> 09:50.260\n that this player you believe could have.\n\n09:50.260 --> 09:51.420\n And sometimes they fool you\n\n09:51.420 --> 09:53.220\n or they have a hand that you don't expect them\n\n09:53.220 --> 09:54.280\n to have in their range.\n\n09:54.280 --> 09:56.980\n And you know, maybe a little bit unorthodox\n\n09:56.980 --> 09:59.340\n doing some things you don't expect to throw you off,\n\n09:59.340 --> 10:01.940\n but a range is essentially all the possibilities\n\n10:01.940 --> 10:03.420\n and it narrows as by the time,\n\n10:03.420 --> 10:05.140\n before the flop it's endless,\n\n10:05.140 --> 10:07.260\n player raises, okay, it's minimized.\n\n10:07.260 --> 10:08.420\n You know, a player bets the flop,\n\n10:08.420 --> 10:09.540\n okay, it's minimized further.\n\n10:09.540 --> 10:11.020\n And then by the river, you know,\n\n10:11.020 --> 10:13.900\n you can narrow down the entire range to, you know,\n\n10:13.900 --> 10:15.140\n just maybe even a few hands.\n\n10:15.140 --> 10:17.860\n Is it always shrinking or is there sort of,\n\n10:17.860 --> 10:19.500\n as you get surprised?\n\n10:19.500 --> 10:21.420\n I mean, it's always just an estimate.\n\n10:21.420 --> 10:24.740\n So does it ever expand based on sort of chaotic,\n\n10:24.740 --> 10:29.060\n unpredicted surprising behavior of the players?\n\n10:29.060 --> 10:30.700\n It really should never expand.\n\n10:30.700 --> 10:32.660\n The range of hands should always get smaller, right?\n\n10:32.660 --> 10:35.180\n Like again, we start with the full scope\n\n10:35.180 --> 10:37.020\n and then you should factor in like, okay,\n\n10:37.020 --> 10:37.980\n these are all the possible hands\n\n10:37.980 --> 10:39.960\n you can have on the flop now, right?\n\n10:39.960 --> 10:41.980\n We can't have new hands on the turn.\n\n10:41.980 --> 10:44.260\n And if you get to that point where you think,\n\n10:44.260 --> 10:45.940\n oh, well, maybe he has this hand,\n\n10:45.940 --> 10:49.040\n then you sort of misjudged his range prior.\n\n10:49.040 --> 10:50.460\n So you're not thinking clearly.\n\n10:50.460 --> 10:54.600\n It should always shrink from the full scope to, you know,\n\n10:54.600 --> 10:55.640\n hopefully just a couple.\n\n10:55.640 --> 10:57.660\n Well, in that video, you also talk about,\n\n10:57.660 --> 10:59.780\n it used to be that you would play your hand,\n\n10:59.780 --> 11:02.080\n but now you're playing a range\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:03.580\n that you're representing a range.\n\n11:03.580 --> 11:05.660\n You're not even just playing your hand.\n\n11:05.660 --> 11:08.740\n So what does it mean to represent a certain range?\n\n11:08.740 --> 11:09.940\n Yeah, so that's another big thing\n\n11:09.940 --> 11:11.480\n that's different about poker from, you know,\n\n11:11.480 --> 11:13.860\n my day to today is that back in our day,\n\n11:13.860 --> 11:15.540\n we would like put people on one hand.\n\n11:15.540 --> 11:17.300\n I'm like, you probably have king nine\n\n11:17.300 --> 11:19.220\n or you have jacks or something like that.\n\n11:19.220 --> 11:21.180\n Now people are cognizant of the idea\n\n11:21.180 --> 11:23.020\n that you could have an entire range of hands.\n\n11:23.020 --> 11:24.820\n So then you ask yourself in situations,\n\n11:24.820 --> 11:26.620\n all right, I know what I have,\n\n11:26.620 --> 11:29.140\n but what I could have in his mind\n\n11:29.140 --> 11:31.300\n or my opponent's mind is any one of these hands.\n\n11:31.300 --> 11:34.020\n What would I do with the entirety of these hands?\n\n11:34.020 --> 11:36.260\n And so a lot of people that are trying to play optimally,\n\n11:36.260 --> 11:37.700\n you know, game theory optimal,\n\n11:37.700 --> 11:41.260\n they think in terms of what their range of hands would do\n\n11:41.260 --> 11:43.760\n rather than their very specific hand.\n\n11:43.760 --> 11:46.060\n So is bluffing in that context\n\n11:46.060 --> 11:49.900\n essentially misrepresenting the range of hands that you have?\n\n11:49.900 --> 11:51.160\n No. Is that how you think about it?\n\n11:51.160 --> 11:53.220\n Not exactly, because so an optimal range,\n\n11:53.220 --> 11:54.620\n like if I bet the river,\n\n11:54.620 --> 11:56.620\n if I'm playing game theory optimal,\n\n11:56.620 --> 11:59.040\n a portion of my range is going to be, I have it.\n\n11:59.040 --> 12:00.140\n I got the best hand.\n\n12:00.140 --> 12:01.860\n And a portion of my range is going to be bluffs\n\n12:01.860 --> 12:03.380\n and they'll be balanced.\n\n12:03.380 --> 12:05.780\n So in theory, no matter what you do,\n\n12:05.780 --> 12:08.120\n no matter what you do, if you call or you fold,\n\n12:08.120 --> 12:11.620\n in theory, it's just, you're printing a zero, as we say,\n\n12:11.620 --> 12:14.460\n you're not gaining or losing any EV,\n\n12:14.460 --> 12:15.380\n if you were to do it that way.\n\n12:15.380 --> 12:16.280\n What's EV?\n\n12:16.280 --> 12:18.140\n EV is expected value, right?\n\n12:18.140 --> 12:19.780\n So every play that you make,\n\n12:19.780 --> 12:21.960\n you know, it either is going to in the long run,\n\n12:21.960 --> 12:22.980\n you know, make you some money,\n\n12:22.980 --> 12:24.380\n or it's just a losing play.\n\n12:24.380 --> 12:25.340\n And as a professional,\n\n12:25.340 --> 12:29.180\n you try to make the fewest amount of minus EV plays you can.\n\n12:29.180 --> 12:31.860\n And the only reason you would make these minus EV plays\n\n12:31.860 --> 12:34.140\n is potentially if you were trying to set up your opponent\n\n12:34.140 --> 12:35.740\n for something later, right?\n\n12:35.740 --> 12:38.660\n So I might make some minus EV plays, right?\n\n12:38.660 --> 12:40.500\n So that I can exploit you later, right?\n\n12:40.500 --> 12:42.720\n So you're building up an image,\n\n12:42.720 --> 12:45.500\n a player profile that's false in some way.\n\n12:45.500 --> 12:46.340\n Something that I'm going to,\n\n12:46.340 --> 12:48.000\n I'm going to plant seeds in your mind\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:49.560\n so that I can exploit them later.\n\n12:49.560 --> 12:53.000\n So for example, why would players like show a big bluff?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.760\n Like what would be the reason for that?\n\n12:54.760 --> 12:55.620\n They show a big bluff\n\n12:55.620 --> 12:57.320\n so that you know that they're capable of it.\n\n12:57.320 --> 12:58.260\n But maybe in their mind,\n\n12:58.260 --> 12:59.820\n you're never going to do that again.\n\n12:59.820 --> 13:02.460\n But now they think, you know, he bluffed me last time.\n\n13:02.460 --> 13:03.580\n Maybe he's doing it again.\n\n13:03.580 --> 13:06.760\n But that's a, what we call like a level, a leveling war.\n\n13:06.760 --> 13:09.340\n Because it, you know, you can go back and forth\n\n13:09.340 --> 13:11.560\n with whether or not, okay, this guy might know that.\n\n13:11.560 --> 13:12.460\n Like he showed a bluff\n\n13:12.460 --> 13:14.320\n because he's never going to bluff me again.\n\n13:14.320 --> 13:15.860\n So that that's where it gets a little.\n\n13:15.860 --> 13:17.940\n So that's a little bit different.\n\n13:17.940 --> 13:19.620\n The, when we're talking about hand rangers,\n\n13:19.620 --> 13:23.200\n that's different than building up a mental model\n\n13:23.200 --> 13:24.620\n of what your opponents,\n\n13:24.620 --> 13:26.840\n what your opponents think of you\n\n13:26.840 --> 13:30.840\n and what your opponents think that you think of them\n\n13:30.840 --> 13:32.360\n and so on and so forth.\n\n13:32.360 --> 13:35.760\n Are you trying to construct those kinds of mental models?\n\n13:35.760 --> 13:37.480\n And is that separate from the hand rangers?\n\n13:37.480 --> 13:39.120\n They go hand in hand, right?\n\n13:39.120 --> 13:41.360\n So if any given, in a given situation, right?\n\n13:41.360 --> 13:45.160\n My range has this many value hands and this many bluffs.\n\n13:45.160 --> 13:46.000\n Okay?\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.260\n So in theory, if I want to be balanced, you know,\n\n13:48.260 --> 13:49.920\n this is my range and this is what it looks like.\n\n13:49.920 --> 13:52.680\n I'll bet this 50% of the time, bet this 50% of the time.\n\n13:52.680 --> 13:57.480\n However, if I know that you think that I bluff too much,\n\n13:57.480 --> 13:59.100\n right, then I'm not going to bluff as much.\n\n13:59.100 --> 13:59.940\n I'm going to start,\n\n13:59.940 --> 14:02.140\n instead of betting these hands that I would 50, 50,\n\n14:02.140 --> 14:04.640\n now what I'll do is I'll do like 70, 30,\n\n14:04.640 --> 14:06.160\n where I'm basically value betting\n\n14:06.160 --> 14:08.640\n most of the time against you, you know, or vice versa.\n\n14:08.640 --> 14:11.020\n If I know you always fold because you think I have it,\n\n14:11.020 --> 14:12.360\n I'm going to veer the other way.\n\n14:12.360 --> 14:13.520\n And instead of bluffing 50%,\n\n14:13.520 --> 14:15.500\n I'll bluff 70, 80% of the time\n\n14:15.500 --> 14:17.640\n to take advantage of your perception of me.\n\n14:17.640 --> 14:19.040\n So to be successful,\n\n14:19.040 --> 14:23.400\n do you have to construct a solid model of all the players\n\n14:23.400 --> 14:26.600\n in the game or can you ignore them?\n\n14:26.600 --> 14:27.920\n I think it's really important.\n\n14:27.920 --> 14:29.880\n Like when I play, I have in my phone,\n\n14:29.880 --> 14:32.200\n I have a player profile of everyone that I play with.\n\n14:32.200 --> 14:34.040\n Whenever I pick up, whether it's physical tells\n\n14:34.040 --> 14:38.760\n or tendencies they like to, you know, that they have.\n\n14:38.760 --> 14:41.200\n And overall, that's just going to, you know,\n\n14:41.200 --> 14:43.840\n that's going to allow you to exploit more, right?\n\n14:43.840 --> 14:46.520\n So like if I played with somebody I've never played before,\n\n14:46.520 --> 14:48.640\n I'm probably just going to play optimally\n\n14:48.640 --> 14:51.640\n or at least as optimal as I know how until I start to,\n\n14:51.640 --> 14:53.360\n you know, gain some information on that player\n\n14:53.360 --> 14:55.500\n so that I can start to exploit them.\n\n14:55.500 --> 14:57.420\n So what's the, when you say optimally,\n\n14:57.420 --> 14:59.520\n what does optimally mean versus,\n\n14:59.520 --> 15:04.400\n so game theory optimal versus exploitative?\n\n15:04.400 --> 15:06.640\n Yeah, so that's like sort of the big debate in poker.\n\n15:06.640 --> 15:07.800\n We call it for short,\n\n15:07.800 --> 15:11.560\n GTO game theory optimal versus exploitative play.\n\n15:11.560 --> 15:15.160\n So GTO game theory optimal is the idea that no,\n\n15:15.160 --> 15:16.920\n like I'm going to set up my play\n\n15:16.920 --> 15:20.400\n so that no matter what you do, you cannot exploit me.\n\n15:20.400 --> 15:23.960\n So essentially that's playing rock, paper, scissors, right?\n\n15:23.960 --> 15:27.640\n And throwing 33% of each every time, right?\n\n15:27.640 --> 15:29.920\n Nothing you do can beat that, nothing.\n\n15:29.920 --> 15:31.980\n You'll never be able to beat that, right?\n\n15:31.980 --> 15:34.400\n Exploitative play is starting to notice that, okay,\n\n15:34.400 --> 15:35.240\n well, you know what?\n\n15:35.240 --> 15:36.200\n This guy loves rock.\n\n15:36.200 --> 15:37.840\n He loves playing rock.\n\n15:37.840 --> 15:39.460\n So I'm going to go paper a little more.\n\n15:39.460 --> 15:40.600\n So I'm going to take advantage of them.\n\n15:40.600 --> 15:42.200\n So I won't be through, but now all of a sudden,\n\n15:42.200 --> 15:44.440\n when I do that, I'm no longer playing optimal\n\n15:44.440 --> 15:46.240\n because if you knew that I was making that adjustment,\n\n15:46.240 --> 15:47.960\n now you can exploit me.\n\n15:47.960 --> 15:49.200\n So that's where the sort of what we call\n\n15:49.200 --> 15:52.440\n the leveling war happens, where people veer from,\n\n15:52.440 --> 15:56.420\n you know, the optimal line of, okay, 33% each for each one.\n\n15:56.420 --> 16:00.860\n You can't beat that, but you also can't win with that either.\n\n16:00.860 --> 16:03.260\n So you're always trying to be at the cutting,\n\n16:03.260 --> 16:06.120\n at the leading edge of suboptimal play.\n\n16:06.120 --> 16:07.200\n Yeah, you're going back and forth.\n\n16:07.200 --> 16:09.000\n And listen, at the highest levels,\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\n like online that these guys play,\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\n like they're trying to play pretty close\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.120\n to like game theory optimal\n\n16:15.120 --> 16:16.520\n because it's very difficult to do first of all.\n\n16:16.520 --> 16:20.040\n No human being will ever be able to compute\n\n16:20.040 --> 16:21.640\n at the level that computers can.\n\n16:21.640 --> 16:23.420\n It's just never going to happen.\n\n16:23.420 --> 16:26.640\n So that's where like the human mind has to come into play\n\n16:26.640 --> 16:28.480\n and say, all right, well, you know,\n\n16:28.480 --> 16:30.220\n if I was playing against the robot, I would do X,\n\n16:30.220 --> 16:31.880\n but I'm not, I'm playing against you.\n\n16:31.880 --> 16:32.880\n So I have to adjust.\n\n16:32.880 --> 16:36.160\n So does game theory optimal only look at the betting\n\n16:36.160 --> 16:40.560\n and the hands in the current hand\n\n16:40.560 --> 16:42.280\n or does it look at the history?\n\n16:42.280 --> 16:44.600\n So if you were to play optimally, optimally,\n\n16:44.600 --> 16:46.280\n would you need to look at the history\n\n16:46.280 --> 16:47.240\n of the individual players\n\n16:47.240 --> 16:49.400\n or just every hand is taken afresh?\n\n16:49.400 --> 16:52.000\n See, that's why I love playing exploitatively\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.840\n for the most part, because with GTO,\n\n16:54.840 --> 16:56.280\n anything that's happened in the past\n\n16:56.280 --> 16:58.160\n has no bearing on this situation.\n\n16:58.160 --> 17:00.680\n It's simply based on what is the optimal play\n\n17:00.680 --> 17:02.340\n in a vacuum in this spot.\n\n17:02.340 --> 17:03.840\n Whereas exploitatively, okay,\n\n17:03.840 --> 17:06.140\n this guy bluffs way too much in these spots.\n\n17:06.140 --> 17:08.980\n So now I can make an adjustment and call more, you know,\n\n17:08.980 --> 17:11.000\n based on past information.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:14.120\n GTO doesn't take into account history at all.\n\n17:14.120 --> 17:15.280\n So like in a tournament,\n\n17:15.280 --> 17:17.680\n how quickly can you construct a player profile\n\n17:17.680 --> 17:19.360\n that you've never played before?\n\n17:19.360 --> 17:22.360\n Depends on the level of the buy in really, right?\n\n17:22.360 --> 17:25.600\n So the higher the buy in, generally speaking,\n\n17:25.600 --> 17:27.480\n you can assume if they're professionals,\n\n17:27.480 --> 17:29.600\n that they're gonna have pretty similar profiles\n\n17:29.600 --> 17:31.040\n because you know, everyone's playing,\n\n17:31.040 --> 17:32.560\n you know, if you're playing this game well,\n\n17:32.560 --> 17:34.660\n it looks similar, right?\n\n17:34.660 --> 17:35.840\n At the lower levels, you know,\n\n17:35.840 --> 17:39.020\n playing say in $1,000 or $1,500 buy in or less,\n\n17:39.020 --> 17:41.800\n you know, within a half an hour or an hour,\n\n17:41.800 --> 17:43.000\n I have an idea of all right,\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.840\n just by seeing how some players played a few hands that,\n\n17:46.840 --> 17:48.000\n you know, so here's the thing with poker,\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.080\n it's like, I can see one clue of what he did.\n\n17:50.080 --> 17:51.760\n And it tells me so much about what he'll do\n\n17:51.760 --> 17:53.920\n in a vast number of scenarios.\n\n17:53.920 --> 17:55.120\n And you're saying at the high level,\n\n17:55.120 --> 17:56.440\n people don't give too many clues.\n\n17:56.440 --> 17:57.280\n I mean, then.\n\n17:57.280 --> 17:59.160\n Well, at the highest level is,\n\n17:59.160 --> 18:00.480\n people are so much more similar\n\n18:00.480 --> 18:02.200\n in terms of their style of play.\n\n18:02.200 --> 18:04.880\n They try to find some kind of balance between the GTO.\n\n18:04.880 --> 18:07.240\n And now with all that we've seen on TV, right?\n\n18:07.240 --> 18:08.880\n Like people get to watch streams and whatever.\n\n18:08.880 --> 18:10.860\n So you get to watch all the top players play.\n\n18:10.860 --> 18:11.960\n So if you wanna learn how to play better,\n\n18:11.960 --> 18:12.840\n guess what you do?\n\n18:12.840 --> 18:14.920\n You copy what they're doing, essentially.\n\n18:14.920 --> 18:16.440\n Like, oh, he's only raising this much.\n\n18:16.440 --> 18:17.560\n I'm gonna do the same.\n\n18:17.560 --> 18:18.400\n They're betting this much.\n\n18:18.400 --> 18:19.360\n I'm gonna do the same.\n\n18:19.360 --> 18:21.520\n So as a result,\n\n18:21.520 --> 18:23.980\n what you end up having is sort of,\n\n18:25.120 --> 18:26.600\n you know, everyone deciding.\n\n18:26.600 --> 18:28.480\n Like, I guess it's similar in chess with openings, right?\n\n18:28.480 --> 18:29.840\n People figure out, okay, this is an opening.\n\n18:29.840 --> 18:30.960\n This is what you do.\n\n18:30.960 --> 18:31.840\n And that's it, you know?\n\n18:31.840 --> 18:33.360\n And then everyone's similar to that.\n\n18:33.360 --> 18:35.060\n And then you have, of course, the outliers\n\n18:35.060 --> 18:36.760\n who try to do things a little differently\n\n18:36.760 --> 18:38.360\n and confuse people.\n\n18:38.360 --> 18:39.500\n It seems like the outliers,\n\n18:39.500 --> 18:41.400\n like we talked offline that Magnus,\n\n18:41.400 --> 18:43.480\n in order to win Magnus Carlsen,\n\n18:43.480 --> 18:45.980\n has to play suboptimally in the openings\n\n18:45.980 --> 18:49.320\n to take his opponents out of the comfort zone\n\n18:49.320 --> 18:51.520\n so he can play what he calls pure chess\n\n18:51.520 --> 18:52.880\n as quickly as possible,\n\n18:52.880 --> 18:56.280\n which is just both short and deep calculations.\n\n18:56.280 --> 18:57.760\n Purely, you're looking at the board\n\n18:57.760 --> 19:01.720\n versus memorized openings and memorized lines.\n\n19:01.720 --> 19:05.440\n Is it the case that the best poker players\n\n19:05.440 --> 19:09.760\n are the ones that are able to, at the right time,\n\n19:09.760 --> 19:14.760\n play really suboptimally or really unorthodox?\n\n19:15.480 --> 19:17.080\n Yeah, specifically there's one guy\n\n19:17.080 --> 19:19.580\n who last year sort of took the poker world by storm,\n\n19:19.580 --> 19:21.080\n and his name was Michael Adamo.\n\n19:21.080 --> 19:22.840\n And he was doing things, like I said,\n\n19:22.840 --> 19:25.100\n you know, most of the top pros play very similarly\n\n19:25.100 --> 19:27.280\n with the way that they construct ranges\n\n19:27.280 --> 19:28.860\n and their bet sizing and all these kinds of things.\n\n19:28.860 --> 19:30.840\n He was doing some crazy things\n\n19:30.840 --> 19:32.720\n that nobody else was doing.\n\n19:32.720 --> 19:36.080\n So he studied sort of a different form of poker\n\n19:36.080 --> 19:38.080\n and it was unorthodox.\n\n19:38.080 --> 19:40.380\n And it, you know, it throws people off\n\n19:40.380 --> 19:41.720\n because he's in his comfort zone\n\n19:41.720 --> 19:43.360\n with these bet sizes and different things,\n\n19:43.360 --> 19:44.400\n whereas everyone else,\n\n19:44.400 --> 19:46.640\n they're not well studied in those spots.\n\n19:46.640 --> 19:49.200\n So as a result of him being unorthodox,\n\n19:49.200 --> 19:51.640\n he became like a monster and very difficult to play against\n\n19:51.640 --> 19:53.080\n because he really knew what he was doing with it.\n\n19:53.080 --> 19:54.800\n In tournament or cash games?\n\n19:54.800 --> 19:55.640\n It was tournaments, yeah.\n\n19:55.640 --> 19:56.920\n He was crushing tournaments.\n\n19:56.920 --> 19:58.640\n He was going against the norm\n\n19:58.640 --> 20:00.960\n in terms of what is like, you know,\n\n20:00.960 --> 20:02.720\n this is what you should do as a poker player in this spot.\n\n20:02.720 --> 20:04.160\n He wasn't doing that.\n\n20:04.160 --> 20:05.800\n He was doing what he thought was best\n\n20:05.800 --> 20:07.120\n and he was doing things outside the norm\n\n20:07.120 --> 20:08.960\n that again, in a vacuum, you could look at that\n\n20:08.960 --> 20:10.920\n and you go, that's incorrect.\n\n20:10.920 --> 20:11.920\n That he should not do.\n\n20:11.920 --> 20:13.700\n That is a clear cut mistake.\n\n20:13.700 --> 20:16.240\n Even, you know, the solvers or the computers\n\n20:16.240 --> 20:18.520\n or game theory would say, this is wrong what he's doing.\n\n20:18.520 --> 20:21.400\n But it's not wrong if he's doing it in a way\n\n20:21.400 --> 20:24.200\n that he's exploiting other players tendencies.\n\n20:24.200 --> 20:26.200\n So for example, with him,\n\n20:26.200 --> 20:28.640\n say he's playing far too aggressively, okay?\n\n20:28.640 --> 20:31.280\n That's not good unless your opponents\n\n20:31.280 --> 20:33.000\n are playing way too passively.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.720\n So if your opponents are playing passively,\n\n20:34.720 --> 20:36.420\n the answer is to be more aggressive with them.\n\n20:36.420 --> 20:38.000\n And that's, I think one of the, you know,\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.820\n biggest advantages he had was he was willing to do that.\n\n20:40.820 --> 20:44.440\n So bet huge, big, big pots bluffing.\n\n20:44.440 --> 20:45.280\n Huge.\n\n20:45.280 --> 20:47.520\n So in a spot where somebody would make it a thousand,\n\n20:47.520 --> 20:49.440\n he's making it 22,000.\n\n20:49.440 --> 20:50.440\n Like what?\n\n20:50.440 --> 20:51.280\n What is this?\n\n20:51.280 --> 20:52.120\n This makes no sense.\n\n20:52.120 --> 20:53.720\n And then people kind of know he has nothing,\n\n20:53.720 --> 20:56.340\n but they're too afraid to call him on it.\n\n20:56.340 --> 20:58.160\n Well, and then sometimes what happens is\n\n20:58.160 --> 20:59.320\n this is where the leveling comes in.\n\n20:59.320 --> 21:00.560\n You're like, man, this guy's crazy.\n\n21:00.560 --> 21:01.600\n He's bluffing like nuts.\n\n21:01.600 --> 21:04.000\n Then he bets the 22,000 and you say,\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.240\n ah, I'm taking my stand.\n\n21:05.240 --> 21:07.720\n I call, and then he shows you like, you know,\n\n21:07.720 --> 21:09.480\n four of a kind or something like that.\n\n21:09.480 --> 21:11.160\n So he gets people out of their comfort zone.\n\n21:11.160 --> 21:12.560\n And I really enjoy watching him play.\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:15.800\n He's probably my favorite player to watch today.\n\n21:15.800 --> 21:16.880\n Watching a guy like that,\n\n21:16.880 --> 21:19.280\n what aspect of his play have you been able\n\n21:19.280 --> 21:20.800\n to incorporate into your own?\n\n21:20.800 --> 21:22.120\n Like, what do you learn from that?\n\n21:22.120 --> 21:23.000\n Cause you're constantly learning,\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:23.960\n you're constantly adjusting.\n\n21:23.960 --> 21:24.800\n Yeah.\n\n21:24.800 --> 21:25.620\n Well, no, and I love it.\n\n21:25.620 --> 21:27.160\n And as I said, so I think a lot of players\n\n21:27.160 --> 21:28.840\n sort of come to the same conclusions about\n\n21:28.840 --> 21:30.760\n this is how you play the spot, but he doesn't.\n\n21:30.760 --> 21:32.760\n And I love watching and thinking in terms of like,\n\n21:32.760 --> 21:33.800\n why he's doing this.\n\n21:33.800 --> 21:35.480\n And one specific thing, for example,\n\n21:35.480 --> 21:38.320\n is he's willing to really go for it.\n\n21:38.320 --> 21:40.680\n So in a spot where let's say he bets 2000,\n\n21:40.680 --> 21:43.760\n he knows he'll get you to call 2000, right?\n\n21:43.760 --> 21:45.480\n But he wants it all.\n\n21:45.480 --> 21:46.360\n He wants it all.\n\n21:46.360 --> 21:47.800\n So he says, you know what?\n\n21:47.800 --> 21:50.320\n I'll give up the 2000 that's guaranteed\n\n21:50.320 --> 21:52.780\n and I'll bet 50,000.\n\n21:52.780 --> 21:54.580\n And maybe if you call that now, you know,\n\n21:54.580 --> 21:57.080\n so listen, you lose the 2007, eight times,\n\n21:57.080 --> 21:59.680\n but if I get called for the 50 just once,\n\n21:59.680 --> 22:01.280\n you know, I'm profiting from that.\n\n22:01.280 --> 22:05.120\n And it also sets the, you know, the template for you\n\n22:05.120 --> 22:07.040\n to really sort of be a player\n\n22:07.040 --> 22:08.120\n that people are afraid to play against.\n\n22:08.120 --> 22:11.080\n He knocked me out in a tournament very early on\n\n22:11.080 --> 22:12.200\n in a huge event.\n\n22:12.200 --> 22:14.400\n And he had, he was so far ahead.\n\n22:14.400 --> 22:17.520\n He was one step ahead of my thought process in hand.\n\n22:17.520 --> 22:19.920\n And he did something that makes no sense whatsoever.\n\n22:19.920 --> 22:21.400\n I looked it up on the computer.\n\n22:21.400 --> 22:24.320\n Huge mistake, if you will, but not a mistake\n\n22:24.320 --> 22:25.880\n because he was taking advantage of my tendency.\n\n22:25.880 --> 22:26.800\n Do you remember the cars?\n\n22:26.800 --> 22:27.640\n Is there an example?\n\n22:27.640 --> 22:28.460\n I remember the whole thing.\n\n22:28.460 --> 22:29.300\n Yeah.\n\n22:29.300 --> 22:30.760\n I remember it like it was yesterday.\n\n22:30.760 --> 22:33.200\n Can you take it like through an example hand\n\n22:33.200 --> 22:34.800\n that really demonstrates it?\n\n22:34.800 --> 22:36.240\n So I'll explain the hand here.\n\n22:36.240 --> 22:39.440\n So I'm on the button and I have ace king,\n\n22:39.440 --> 22:40.800\n which is a very good hand.\n\n22:40.800 --> 22:43.800\n And I raise and he calls from the big blind.\n\n22:43.800 --> 22:45.440\n The flop is nine, seven, five.\n\n22:45.440 --> 22:47.040\n So I have nothing really here.\n\n22:47.040 --> 22:49.240\n He checks, I check behind.\n\n22:49.240 --> 22:51.320\n The turn card's an ace.\n\n22:51.320 --> 22:53.560\n He checks, I bet half the pot.\n\n22:53.560 --> 22:56.820\n There were 6,000 there, I bet 3,000, okay?\n\n22:56.820 --> 22:59.140\n Now this is not a typical thing you see people do,\n\n22:59.140 --> 23:01.760\n but he raised me to 36,000.\n\n23:01.760 --> 23:04.560\n Massive raise, bigger than the size of the pot.\n\n23:04.560 --> 23:05.720\n What was the flop again?\n\n23:05.720 --> 23:08.000\n Nine, seven, five, turn an ace.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.040\n What is he representing exactly?\n\n23:10.040 --> 23:10.880\n Well, he could have a straight,\n\n23:10.880 --> 23:12.200\n he could have three, three of a kind.\n\n23:12.200 --> 23:13.600\n He could have, you know, aces up.\n\n23:13.600 --> 23:14.760\n He could have a whole bunch of hands.\n\n23:14.760 --> 23:16.960\n So he check raises me big to 36,000.\n\n23:16.960 --> 23:18.160\n I call the bet.\n\n23:18.160 --> 23:20.040\n So now there's something like 75,000.\n\n23:20.040 --> 23:23.640\n The river is a five.\n\n23:23.640 --> 23:25.660\n So the board pairs, okay?\n\n23:26.840 --> 23:29.040\n He thinks for a while and he bets all of it,\n\n23:29.040 --> 23:30.600\n which is three times the pot.\n\n23:30.600 --> 23:32.300\n He bets 225,000.\n\n23:32.300 --> 23:34.720\n There's only 75,000 out there, right?\n\n23:34.720 --> 23:36.960\n And in theory, he should never ever have a hand\n\n23:36.960 --> 23:38.640\n that can do that, right?\n\n23:38.640 --> 23:39.960\n So it confused me.\n\n23:39.960 --> 23:41.840\n And I was like, okay, well, this guy's aggressive.\n\n23:41.840 --> 23:43.220\n He likes to bluff and all this kind of stuff.\n\n23:43.220 --> 23:45.280\n So I made the call with the ace king\n\n23:45.280 --> 23:47.200\n and he turned over six, eight.\n\n23:47.200 --> 23:49.720\n So we had a straight, but here's the thing.\n\n23:49.720 --> 23:52.920\n In theory, that river card is bad for him.\n\n23:52.920 --> 23:55.980\n When I call the turn, I have a lot of the time,\n\n23:55.980 --> 23:58.320\n three of a kind, two pair that just made a full house.\n\n23:58.320 --> 23:59.640\n So he was risking that.\n\n23:59.640 --> 24:01.300\n And the reason he did it was\n\n24:01.300 --> 24:05.480\n because he thought I would perceive him to be bluffing a lot.\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:07.520\n So he just went for it and it worked.\n\n24:07.520 --> 24:09.240\n He was able to double up right away\n\n24:09.240 --> 24:11.160\n and knock me out of the tournament like an hour in.\n\n24:11.160 --> 24:12.600\n Do you think he thought you might fold?\n\n24:12.600 --> 24:13.440\n Like what is it?\n\n24:13.440 --> 24:15.120\n I think specific, I think it was, it came down to this.\n\n24:15.120 --> 24:17.000\n It's as simple as this.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.580\n He was cognizant of his image\n\n24:19.580 --> 24:21.680\n as being a wild, aggressive bluffer, right?\n\n24:21.680 --> 24:24.240\n And he was fully taking advantage of me,\n\n24:24.240 --> 24:27.540\n knowing that my tendency in these spots is to be curious.\n\n24:27.540 --> 24:29.400\n And I want to call and I want to see it.\n\n24:29.400 --> 24:31.760\n So he was fully taking advantage of the fact\n\n24:31.760 --> 24:33.520\n that he thought I would call too often.\n\n24:33.520 --> 24:35.800\n Because otherwise his play makes no sense.\n\n24:35.800 --> 24:39.000\n A small bet, a medium sized bet, those make sense.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:42.800\n But the bet that he made in theory is indefensible.\n\n24:42.800 --> 24:45.140\n It's just like clearly a mistake.\n\n24:45.140 --> 24:47.040\n But that's why poker is so fascinating\n\n24:47.040 --> 24:48.880\n because he makes this play and it wasn't a mistake.\n\n24:48.880 --> 24:50.840\n It was above the rim, is what it was.\n\n24:50.840 --> 24:53.300\n Do you think he put you on ace something?\n\n24:53.300 --> 24:54.760\n I think exactly what he thought I had,\n\n24:54.760 --> 24:57.160\n was ace king or something like that.\n\n24:57.160 --> 24:58.000\n You know?\n\n24:58.000 --> 24:58.840\n That is so fun.\n\n24:58.840 --> 25:01.240\n That is so fun that the two players at such a high level\n\n25:01.240 --> 25:03.720\n were able to mess with each other's mind.\n\n25:03.720 --> 25:04.540\n How old is he?\n\n25:04.540 --> 25:05.380\n Is he young?\n\n25:05.380 --> 25:06.200\n He's in his 20s, yeah.\n\n25:06.200 --> 25:07.760\n I feel like that takes a lot of guts\n\n25:07.760 --> 25:10.040\n to take risks like that.\n\n25:10.040 --> 25:11.280\n Well, that's what's great about him.\n\n25:11.280 --> 25:12.480\n He's certainly never accused\n\n25:12.480 --> 25:13.840\n of not having the guts to put it in.\n\n25:13.840 --> 25:15.540\n And that's scary to play against, right?\n\n25:15.540 --> 25:17.000\n The easiest opponent to play against\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.940\n is one who's just straightforward,\n\n25:18.940 --> 25:21.660\n passive, you know, not wild and crazy.\n\n25:21.660 --> 25:23.120\n Playing against him,\n\n25:23.120 --> 25:25.080\n he's going to put you in the blender, as we say.\n\n25:25.080 --> 25:28.840\n Yeah, how can you control\n\n25:28.840 --> 25:31.960\n what you're perceived as representing?\n\n25:31.960 --> 25:34.360\n What hand you're perceived of as representing?\n\n25:34.360 --> 25:38.400\n So if we're, if the game of modern poker is,\n\n25:38.400 --> 25:40.560\n others are representing certain hands\n\n25:40.560 --> 25:42.280\n through the information they convey,\n\n25:42.280 --> 25:45.000\n and you're representing a certain hand range, sorry,\n\n25:45.840 --> 25:47.540\n through your play, how can you control that?\n\n25:47.540 --> 25:50.740\n Or is that not, is that the wrong way to think about it?\n\n25:50.740 --> 25:54.200\n But isn't bluffing and bet sizing\n\n25:54.200 --> 25:57.400\n and all of that kind of stuff essentially controlling\n\n25:57.400 --> 26:01.200\n what others perceive as the hand range you have?\n\n26:01.200 --> 26:04.000\n Ultimately, in terms of like controlling\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.520\n people's perception of you, you can't fully control it,\n\n26:06.520 --> 26:10.720\n but you can do things to sway it, right?\n\n26:10.720 --> 26:12.880\n As I said earlier, showing bluffs and things like that,\n\n26:12.880 --> 26:14.160\n you know, leads your opponent to think\n\n26:14.160 --> 26:16.240\n maybe you do this more often than you're supposed to\n\n26:16.240 --> 26:17.080\n or whatever the case may be.\n\n26:17.080 --> 26:21.220\n But in terms of like controlling, you know,\n\n26:21.220 --> 26:24.620\n what your opponent can think about your hands\n\n26:24.620 --> 26:26.420\n in certain spots, I don't really think it equates that way.\n\n26:26.420 --> 26:28.260\n It doesn't really, you know, I think what people do\n\n26:28.260 --> 26:29.980\n when they're playing a hand is they think in terms of,\n\n26:29.980 --> 26:33.100\n all right, what does my range look like here?\n\n26:33.100 --> 26:35.460\n Okay, so my range has value.\n\n26:35.460 --> 26:36.660\n So you look at, you know,\n\n26:36.660 --> 26:38.880\n the actual hand you have secondarily.\n\n26:38.880 --> 26:41.340\n So you say, okay, well, I could have this,\n\n26:41.340 --> 26:43.780\n I could have this, I actually have this, right?\n\n26:43.780 --> 26:44.860\n But I could have all these hands.\n\n26:44.860 --> 26:46.780\n So my opponent, if he's thinking on a high level,\n\n26:46.780 --> 26:49.080\n he knows I could have all these hands and I have this one.\n\n26:49.080 --> 26:51.380\n So what do I do with this one, right, in the bigger scope\n\n26:51.380 --> 26:52.220\n of things?\n\n26:52.220 --> 26:55.860\n I guess I'm trying to understand if your betting\n\n26:55.860 --> 26:58.980\n isn't a bet, preflop, your bet,\n\n26:58.980 --> 27:01.500\n doesn't that narrow the hand ranges?\n\n27:01.500 --> 27:04.660\n Doesn't matter what you have, it narrows the end.\n\n27:04.660 --> 27:05.540\n Absolutely.\n\n27:05.540 --> 27:10.540\n And if you bet big combined with the perception of you\n\n27:11.820 --> 27:14.720\n at the table, doesn't that represent the hand range?\n\n27:14.720 --> 27:16.020\n Uh huh, absolutely.\n\n27:16.020 --> 27:18.240\n So like you can, with betting essentially control\n\n27:18.240 --> 27:20.220\n what people estimate you to have.\n\n27:20.220 --> 27:23.380\n Sure, so that makes it, so yeah, so that's true.\n\n27:23.380 --> 27:26.440\n So for example, one of the most extreme examples is,\n\n27:26.440 --> 27:29.660\n we have, there's spots where there's a bet\n\n27:29.660 --> 27:31.920\n that's considered polarizing, right?\n\n27:31.920 --> 27:34.540\n So let's say there's a thousand in the pot\n\n27:34.540 --> 27:37.380\n and you bet 10,000, which is crazy big, right?\n\n27:37.380 --> 27:38.580\n That's saying one of two things.\n\n27:38.580 --> 27:41.380\n I either have the absolute best possible hand\n\n27:41.380 --> 27:42.700\n or absolutely nothing,\n\n27:42.700 --> 27:44.140\n because any of the hands in the middle,\n\n27:44.140 --> 27:45.540\n I wouldn't do that with.\n\n27:45.540 --> 27:47.980\n So I'm essentially telling you when I bet that,\n\n27:47.980 --> 27:51.220\n I'm like, I either got it or I got,\n\n27:51.220 --> 27:52.540\n I don't have a mediocre hand,\n\n27:52.540 --> 27:54.520\n like just a pair of nines or a pair of tens.\n\n27:54.520 --> 27:57.820\n I have a royal flush or have nine high.\n\n27:57.820 --> 27:59.620\n So with my bet sizing,\n\n27:59.620 --> 28:02.540\n I can control how my opponent is perceiving\n\n28:02.540 --> 28:03.380\n what my range is gonna be.\n\n28:03.380 --> 28:07.220\n So for example, similarly, if I bet small, right?\n\n28:07.220 --> 28:09.540\n Well, that could be a lot of hands, right?\n\n28:09.540 --> 28:12.180\n That could represent a big part of my range.\n\n28:12.180 --> 28:14.740\n The bigger the bet, the more, the narrower the range.\n\n28:14.740 --> 28:16.220\n Apparently the more polarized it is.\n\n28:16.220 --> 28:19.380\n Yeah, how far could you get\n\n28:19.380 --> 28:20.580\n without looking at your cards?\n\n28:20.580 --> 28:22.700\n Do you think how well could you do?\n\n28:22.700 --> 28:24.740\n It depends on who I'm playing with, right?\n\n28:24.740 --> 28:26.380\n So if I was playing in a tournament\n\n28:26.380 --> 28:28.320\n with mediocre or weak players,\n\n28:28.320 --> 28:30.620\n I think I could probably do pretty well.\n\n28:30.620 --> 28:32.420\n But even like world class.\n\n28:32.420 --> 28:34.380\n World class, I don't think you'd have much of a chance,\n\n28:34.380 --> 28:35.220\n really, I mean.\n\n28:35.220 --> 28:36.580\n The question is trying to get at like,\n\n28:36.580 --> 28:39.060\n how important is it that the actual hands you have\n\n28:39.060 --> 28:41.900\n versus the hands you're representing?\n\n28:41.900 --> 28:43.460\n Right, so that's the question of essentially,\n\n28:43.460 --> 28:45.100\n if you're not looking at your hand preflop,\n\n28:45.100 --> 28:48.260\n you're basically giving up a fundamental advantage, right?\n\n28:48.260 --> 28:50.660\n Where you're gonna be playing way suboptimally\n\n28:50.660 --> 28:52.080\n in terms of your hand selection, right?\n\n28:52.080 --> 28:53.420\n Cause if you don't look at your hand,\n\n28:53.420 --> 28:54.880\n you might have a two and a three.\n\n28:54.880 --> 28:56.940\n That's not good, but now you're playing it.\n\n28:56.940 --> 28:59.620\n So you've invested whatever, two, 3000 bucks\n\n28:59.620 --> 29:01.060\n with absolute garbage,\n\n29:01.060 --> 29:03.700\n and it's very difficult to climb that hill, right?\n\n29:03.700 --> 29:05.540\n So it's much better to actually look at your cards\n\n29:05.540 --> 29:07.340\n and go, okay, I'll throw away the two and three\n\n29:07.340 --> 29:08.860\n and I'll play the ace king.\n\n29:08.860 --> 29:12.140\n Speaking of garbage, you've said that 10, seven\n\n29:12.140 --> 29:13.580\n is your favorite poker hand to play.\n\n29:13.580 --> 29:16.840\n Is that still the case and what aspect of it\n\n29:16.840 --> 29:18.820\n is that you enjoy?\n\n29:18.820 --> 29:21.580\n Yeah, so it's one of those viewer discretion is advised.\n\n29:21.580 --> 29:24.340\n Like 10, seven, I've just noticed throughout my life,\n\n29:24.340 --> 29:27.280\n you know, it's a tendency thing that I've been lucky with it.\n\n29:27.280 --> 29:28.180\n So that's just sort of,\n\n29:28.180 --> 29:30.220\n but it's not like I'm gonna look at 10, seven and go,\n\n29:30.220 --> 29:32.300\n oh, wow, you know, I'm gonna call it all in\n\n29:32.300 --> 29:33.260\n or anything like that.\n\n29:33.260 --> 29:35.740\n I'll play it in situations where it makes sense,\n\n29:35.740 --> 29:38.260\n but you know, it's rare cause it's not a very good hand.\n\n29:38.260 --> 29:42.960\n But is there some aspect of belief\n\n29:42.960 --> 29:47.020\n in the magic of this hand manifests quality of play?\n\n29:47.020 --> 29:47.860\n Or is that a little?\n\n29:47.860 --> 29:48.700\n There should be.\n\n29:48.700 --> 29:49.940\n So here's the thing, it's, you know,\n\n29:49.940 --> 29:51.460\n poker players, some have said\n\n29:51.460 --> 29:53.340\n it's unlucky to be superstitious,\n\n29:53.340 --> 29:55.940\n but we're all a little bit superstitious, a little bit.\n\n29:55.940 --> 29:57.300\n You know, and so I don't know,\n\n29:57.300 --> 29:59.240\n maybe it is a case where when I have 10, seven,\n\n29:59.240 --> 30:01.900\n I feel somehow energetically that, you know,\n\n30:01.900 --> 30:03.260\n I'm more likely to catch something,\n\n30:03.260 --> 30:06.020\n which may actually make me more apt to be aggressive\n\n30:06.020 --> 30:07.340\n and confident in the hand.\n\n30:07.340 --> 30:10.060\n But you really shouldn't let yourself do that.\n\n30:10.060 --> 30:11.180\n Like you're not supposed to fall in love\n\n30:11.180 --> 30:12.780\n with any specific hands.\n\n30:12.780 --> 30:17.780\n Yeah, but you know, uncertainty is ruthless.\n\n30:18.220 --> 30:23.220\n It's, you know, the fact that it's a game of statistics,\n\n30:23.380 --> 30:26.900\n it can be too painful for the human psychology.\n\n30:26.900 --> 30:30.820\n So maybe you have to hold on to certain superstitions.\n\n30:30.820 --> 30:34.420\n Because, you know, I mean, there's a cold absurdity\n\n30:34.420 --> 30:38.740\n to the fact that you can play extremely well and still lose.\n\n30:38.740 --> 30:43.740\n I mean, actually this year you've played the,\n\n30:43.980 --> 30:47.700\n what is it, 50 days of World Series of Poker.\n\n30:47.700 --> 30:50.980\n And it seems like, at least from the perspective\n\n30:50.980 --> 30:53.020\n of me looking at it through the internet,\n\n30:53.020 --> 30:54.620\n it seems like there's a lot of hands\n\n30:54.620 --> 30:59.140\n that you were like 70, 30, 80, 20, all in hands\n\n30:59.140 --> 31:02.420\n that you just did not, were not going your way.\n\n31:02.420 --> 31:04.220\n That can sort of break you mentally.\n\n31:04.220 --> 31:05.460\n Absolutely.\n\n31:05.460 --> 31:07.460\n Yeah, one of the hardest things, especially about playing,\n\n31:07.460 --> 31:09.620\n because cash games and tournaments are different.\n\n31:09.620 --> 31:11.140\n One of the most difficult things about, you know,\n\n31:11.140 --> 31:13.380\n being a tournament player is resilience.\n\n31:13.380 --> 31:14.820\n Because more often than not, like,\n\n31:14.820 --> 31:17.420\n so if there's a tournament with a thousand people,\n\n31:17.420 --> 31:19.460\n to win the tournament, you have to get all of the chips.\n\n31:19.460 --> 31:22.220\n That means there's one winner and 999 losers.\n\n31:22.220 --> 31:25.500\n So it's very rare that you actually like win all the chips.\n\n31:25.500 --> 31:27.220\n So you're essentially at some point\n\n31:27.220 --> 31:28.180\n in every tournament you play,\n\n31:28.180 --> 31:31.320\n gonna deal with like really bad luck and disappointment.\n\n31:31.320 --> 31:34.540\n And sometimes those streaks can have you question yourself\n\n31:34.540 --> 31:35.980\n and be introspective about, okay,\n\n31:35.980 --> 31:38.020\n so I think I'm 47 now.\n\n31:38.020 --> 31:40.220\n I think I've gotten better as time went on\n\n31:40.220 --> 31:42.140\n between distinguishing, okay,\n\n31:42.140 --> 31:44.720\n am I losing right now because of bad luck?\n\n31:44.720 --> 31:47.020\n Or is it fundamentally decisions I'm making\n\n31:47.020 --> 31:48.820\n are not very good, right?\n\n31:48.820 --> 31:50.220\n And that's one of the hardest things\n\n31:50.220 --> 31:53.300\n for anyone who plays poker to get to, right?\n\n31:53.300 --> 31:54.340\n Why am I losing?\n\n31:54.340 --> 31:57.300\n Am I losing because of my opponents being better?\n\n31:57.300 --> 31:59.460\n I'm not playing well, or am I losing just because of luck?\n\n31:59.460 --> 32:02.580\n And because there's so much variance in poker,\n\n32:02.580 --> 32:04.780\n a lot of players can be confused\n\n32:04.780 --> 32:06.020\n on both sides of the coin.\n\n32:06.020 --> 32:07.700\n One guy's winning and he thinks he's great.\n\n32:07.700 --> 32:11.020\n He's really not, wait till the cards break even as we say.\n\n32:11.020 --> 32:13.500\n I think there's a lot of parallels to life as well.\n\n32:13.500 --> 32:15.620\n If you get screwed over, over and over,\n\n32:15.620 --> 32:17.980\n it's hard to know if you're doing something wrong\n\n32:17.980 --> 32:19.940\n or if it's just bad luck.\n\n32:19.940 --> 32:20.980\n I think they did a study.\n\n32:20.980 --> 32:22.060\n I remember there was like a study\n\n32:22.060 --> 32:23.900\n that was mostly related to gambling,\n\n32:23.900 --> 32:25.980\n but it was mice and they put them in a little maze\n\n32:25.980 --> 32:27.940\n and they go down these three tubes\n\n32:27.940 --> 32:30.900\n and they go down this one tube and there'd be cheese, right?\n\n32:30.900 --> 32:32.780\n And then they go down again, cheese.\n\n32:32.780 --> 32:34.980\n Three times in a row there was cheese there, right?\n\n32:34.980 --> 32:38.140\n The next time there was an electric shock there, not cheese.\n\n32:39.500 --> 32:42.980\n The rat went, you know, the mouse went to get zapped.\n\n32:42.980 --> 32:44.660\n He got zapped, okay, came back.\n\n32:44.660 --> 32:47.420\n He kept going back to get zapped until he died.\n\n32:47.420 --> 32:50.500\n Like he kept going because he found cheese there.\n\n32:50.500 --> 32:52.100\n He has one there.\n\n32:52.100 --> 32:54.740\n So he continued to go chase that win\n\n32:54.740 --> 32:57.140\n despite it being, you know, now all of a sudden\n\n32:57.140 --> 32:59.340\n not worthwhile till he died.\n\n32:59.340 --> 33:01.260\n And essentially what they said was\n\n33:01.260 --> 33:03.340\n that is essentially how they compared it\n\n33:03.340 --> 33:04.980\n to like, you know, the gambling brain\n\n33:04.980 --> 33:06.780\n and how people think about gambling.\n\n33:06.780 --> 33:08.180\n You're chasing the wins.\n\n33:08.180 --> 33:09.860\n You learn too much.\n\n33:09.860 --> 33:12.420\n You sort of overgeneralize the lessons learned\n\n33:12.420 --> 33:13.460\n from the times you've won.\n\n33:13.460 --> 33:15.620\n So yeah, like beginner's luck can be detrimental.\n\n33:15.620 --> 33:17.980\n If you have some early luck and you believe\n\n33:17.980 --> 33:20.780\n that this is just the way it's supposed to be forever,\n\n33:20.780 --> 33:23.500\n you know, it can put you in a delusional state\n\n33:23.500 --> 33:26.500\n where, you know, you feel like I'm just great,\n\n33:26.500 --> 33:27.420\n but no, you're not.\n\n33:27.420 --> 33:28.740\n You were just lucky in the beginning.\n\n33:28.740 --> 33:31.460\n I actually played poker once in Vegas.\n\n33:31.460 --> 33:34.060\n It was a, it wasn't a tournament,\n\n33:34.060 --> 33:37.900\n but it was a kind of tournament like style.\n\n33:37.900 --> 33:39.060\n I already forgot what it was.\n\n33:39.060 --> 33:42.980\n But what I do remember is that I had four of a kind.\n\n33:42.980 --> 33:46.500\n So the last hand I've ever played in poker was,\n\n33:46.500 --> 33:50.580\n I got a four of a kind and there was a couple of others\n\n33:50.580 --> 33:51.460\n with really strong hands.\n\n33:51.460 --> 33:53.100\n So everybody went all in.\n\n33:53.100 --> 33:54.580\n And I think you get some kind of bonus\n\n33:54.580 --> 33:55.500\n for getting four of a kind.\n\n33:55.500 --> 33:56.860\n Bad beat jackpot you were playing in.\n\n33:56.860 --> 33:58.460\n Yeah, so something like this.\n\n33:58.460 --> 34:00.380\n I apologize if I don't know the details,\n\n34:00.380 --> 34:02.300\n but I just remember winning a lot of money\n\n34:02.300 --> 34:04.060\n and I walked away from the table.\n\n34:04.060 --> 34:05.260\n I said, I'm not playing poker again.\n\n34:05.260 --> 34:06.100\n This is great.\n\n34:06.100 --> 34:07.060\n I'm gonna hit it up top.\n\n34:07.060 --> 34:09.340\n Cause I started to feel like this is your,\n\n34:09.340 --> 34:10.180\n I started to think,\n\n34:10.180 --> 34:12.180\n even though I haven't really played poker at all,\n\n34:12.180 --> 34:13.300\n that I'm good.\n\n34:13.300 --> 34:15.420\n And that was a really dangerous feeling.\n\n34:15.420 --> 34:17.180\n And everybody was really mad for walking away\n\n34:17.180 --> 34:18.140\n from the table.\n\n34:18.140 --> 34:19.460\n One of the other things that I think is interesting\n\n34:19.460 --> 34:21.980\n about poker too is good is relative, right?\n\n34:21.980 --> 34:25.180\n So you could be the seventh best player in the whole world,\n\n34:25.180 --> 34:26.900\n like literally seventh best player.\n\n34:26.900 --> 34:29.460\n But if you're playing with the other six,\n\n34:29.460 --> 34:30.940\n you're the sucker.\n\n34:30.940 --> 34:33.820\n You are like the worst player in the game, right?\n\n34:33.820 --> 34:36.580\n So like there's a lot of players, for example,\n\n34:36.580 --> 34:38.420\n like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?\n\n34:38.420 --> 34:40.580\n He's not a top level player,\n\n34:40.580 --> 34:42.500\n like these guys you see on TV,\n\n34:42.500 --> 34:44.620\n but he probably makes more money than they do\n\n34:44.620 --> 34:46.020\n because he plays with people\n\n34:46.020 --> 34:47.660\n that are far below his skill level.\n\n34:47.660 --> 34:50.220\n So part of the skill of being a poker player\n\n34:50.220 --> 34:53.580\n is finding situations where you're profitable,\n\n34:53.580 --> 34:55.620\n regardless of your skill level.\n\n34:55.620 --> 34:57.900\n Another connection to life.\n\n34:57.900 --> 35:01.140\n Do you think Dan Blazarian is telling the truth\n\n35:01.140 --> 35:04.740\n about having made, what is it, $50, $100 million?\n\n35:04.740 --> 35:06.860\n Just a huge amount of money playing poker.\n\n35:06.860 --> 35:09.380\n Considering what I know about the private games\n\n35:09.380 --> 35:11.420\n and the types of players who play in these private games\n\n35:11.420 --> 35:12.780\n and the stakes that they play,\n\n35:12.780 --> 35:14.900\n I absolutely believe Dan has made,\n\n35:14.900 --> 35:16.180\n I don't know how many millions,\n\n35:16.180 --> 35:17.780\n but whether it's 50 or whatever,\n\n35:17.780 --> 35:19.500\n but it wouldn't surprise me\n\n35:19.500 --> 35:21.660\n that if you play in these games within a year\n\n35:21.660 --> 35:23.900\n or you find the right businessman\n\n35:23.900 --> 35:26.140\n who has way too much Bitcoin money,\n\n35:26.140 --> 35:28.300\n and in one night you take him for 20 million,\n\n35:28.300 --> 35:29.660\n I absolutely could see it.\n\n35:29.660 --> 35:30.980\n I don't see any reason why.\n\n35:30.980 --> 35:33.020\n Listen, where he got his money initially,\n\n35:33.020 --> 35:36.540\n that's up to interpretation from his father or whatever,\n\n35:36.540 --> 35:38.940\n but has he made a bunch of money playing poker?\n\n35:38.940 --> 35:40.620\n Absolutely, no question.\n\n35:40.620 --> 35:43.180\n Do you feel, as somebody who loves the game,\n\n35:43.180 --> 35:46.300\n do you think there's something almost ethically wrong\n\n35:46.300 --> 35:48.780\n in playing people much worse than you?\n\n35:48.780 --> 35:50.180\n So yeah, that's a good question\n\n35:50.180 --> 35:53.500\n because part of the reason I played poker\n\n35:53.500 --> 35:54.580\n and wanted to become professional\n\n35:54.580 --> 35:57.180\n was I wanted to make my mother proud, right?\n\n35:57.180 --> 35:58.540\n And I don't think she would be proud of me\n\n35:58.540 --> 36:03.020\n taking Grandma Betty's last $5 and down the street,\n\n36:03.020 --> 36:05.260\n sending her broke and taking her pension check.\n\n36:05.260 --> 36:06.500\n So I play at the high stakes\n\n36:06.500 --> 36:07.780\n against people who can afford it.\n\n36:07.780 --> 36:08.660\n They know who I am.\n\n36:08.660 --> 36:09.500\n I'm not a hustler.\n\n36:09.500 --> 36:12.540\n I'm not pretending I'm bad at poker to squeeze in.\n\n36:12.540 --> 36:13.940\n I was thinking about this just yesterday\n\n36:13.940 --> 36:15.060\n because I played in a game\n\n36:15.060 --> 36:17.900\n that if I played that sort of role\n\n36:17.900 --> 36:19.260\n where a lot of guys do pros\n\n36:19.260 --> 36:21.620\n that sort of play down their skill level,\n\n36:21.620 --> 36:23.420\n pretend they're just one of the guys,\n\n36:23.420 --> 36:27.540\n these guys can make $20, $30 million in a year, legitimately.\n\n36:27.540 --> 36:29.500\n Like I believe that like, if I did that,\n\n36:29.500 --> 36:31.580\n if I just said, you know what, I'm gonna go down that path,\n\n36:31.580 --> 36:33.100\n get into these games in LA, you know,\n\n36:33.100 --> 36:34.500\n and travel and do all this kind of stuff,\n\n36:34.500 --> 36:35.660\n I can make 20 million a year.\n\n36:35.660 --> 36:38.100\n But it feels a little greasy, right?\n\n36:38.100 --> 36:39.620\n I don't like to kiss anyone's ass.\n\n36:39.620 --> 36:43.300\n I don't like to ask anyone for a favor or things like that.\n\n36:43.300 --> 36:48.300\n So, but yeah, like I feel, listen,\n\n36:48.700 --> 36:51.180\n a rich guy who wants to sit down with a million bucks\n\n36:51.180 --> 36:53.180\n and get drunk and lose it, I have no empathy for that.\n\n36:53.180 --> 36:55.620\n I'm like, I don't have any moral qualms with that.\n\n36:55.620 --> 36:57.980\n So if a grandma Betty is a billionaire.\n\n36:59.260 --> 37:01.180\n Send it, send it, right?\n\n37:01.180 --> 37:03.220\n You know, absolutely, why not?\n\n37:04.940 --> 37:06.900\n Well, let me ask you about a tough period\n\n37:06.900 --> 37:08.020\n of your recent life.\n\n37:08.020 --> 37:10.060\n You had a rough, like we mentioned,\n\n37:10.060 --> 37:15.060\n the World Series of Poker losing $1.1 million over 48 days.\n\n37:15.380 --> 37:18.440\n What were you going through mentally during that?\n\n37:18.440 --> 37:20.280\n So here's the thing, you know, I do, like you said,\n\n37:20.280 --> 37:21.520\n I do a YouTube vlog every day.\n\n37:21.520 --> 37:23.820\n So I kind of share my thoughts and listen,\n\n37:23.820 --> 37:26.740\n I can edit that thing and keep out the bad stuff,\n\n37:26.740 --> 37:29.820\n but I think it's more authentic and genuine to show people\n\n37:29.820 --> 37:32.060\n the actual struggles and the pain that I go through,\n\n37:32.060 --> 37:32.900\n you know, without it.\n\n37:32.900 --> 37:35.020\n And I'd say the one thing I'm most proud of\n\n37:35.020 --> 37:36.620\n throughout the entire thing is the resilience\n\n37:36.620 --> 37:39.020\n because there are moments you see me where I'm broken.\n\n37:39.020 --> 37:39.980\n I'm just like, I can't take it.\n\n37:39.980 --> 37:41.720\n I broke a selfie stick this year.\n\n37:41.720 --> 37:42.940\n Like I was filming it.\n\n37:42.940 --> 37:43.940\n Cause you know, I do for my vlog,\n\n37:43.940 --> 37:46.220\n I smashed the stick through it in the corner, right?\n\n37:46.220 --> 37:49.220\n It's just, that was my like hit rock bottom moment.\n\n37:49.220 --> 37:51.220\n And then I put the camera on me and I was like, all right,\n\n37:51.220 --> 37:52.340\n I'll let people see it.\n\n37:52.340 --> 37:53.860\n But mentally it was very difficult\n\n37:53.860 --> 37:56.860\n because there was a feeling of hopelessness\n\n37:56.860 --> 38:00.020\n where I was making good decisions.\n\n38:00.020 --> 38:02.680\n Like I genuinely felt like I'm playing really, really well.\n\n38:02.680 --> 38:04.940\n But every time my money went in and my opponent's money\n\n38:04.940 --> 38:08.140\n went in and say, I was 60%, 70%, 80%\n\n38:08.140 --> 38:11.460\n for about a two week stretch, I lost every one of those.\n\n38:11.460 --> 38:13.500\n And you start to wonder, you're like,\n\n38:13.500 --> 38:16.900\n I can't win if I never win, you know, in these spots.\n\n38:16.900 --> 38:18.300\n So it was difficult.\n\n38:18.300 --> 38:20.980\n Luckily I have, you know, 20 odd years of experience\n\n38:20.980 --> 38:21.980\n on how to deal with it.\n\n38:21.980 --> 38:26.020\n And so, as I said, I wake up the next day, ready to go.\n\n38:26.020 --> 38:27.940\n So as if nothing happened.\n\n38:27.940 --> 38:28.780\n To a certain degree.\n\n38:28.780 --> 38:30.500\n Obviously, you know, the more,\n\n38:30.500 --> 38:32.180\n the more it happens in the higher vines,\n\n38:32.180 --> 38:34.020\n like the one where I broke the selfie stick,\n\n38:34.020 --> 38:37.060\n I lost 500,000 in that tournament, right?\n\n38:37.060 --> 38:38.980\n And it was like the last card, it was painful.\n\n38:38.980 --> 38:40.260\n I think you lost.\n\n38:40.260 --> 38:42.020\n Yeah, that was great, that video.\n\n38:43.340 --> 38:45.020\n I think he lost.\n\n38:45.020 --> 38:47.540\n What led up to the selfie stick gate?\n\n38:47.540 --> 38:49.620\n Like what, you just lost your shit\n\n38:49.620 --> 38:53.780\n for a, like a hundred milliseconds.\n\n38:53.780 --> 38:55.340\n Like it was very brief.\n\n38:55.340 --> 38:58.300\n You're just like, what, the world wasn't making any sense.\n\n38:58.300 --> 39:00.780\n Like, how do I keep losing kind of thing?\n\n39:00.780 --> 39:02.460\n How did you, why did you lose your shit?\n\n39:02.460 --> 39:03.700\n You should never really think like this,\n\n39:03.700 --> 39:06.940\n but part of me felt like I deserved to win this, right?\n\n39:06.940 --> 39:07.780\n So part of me was like, listen,\n\n39:07.780 --> 39:10.100\n I've lost so many in the last two weeks, all right.\n\n39:10.100 --> 39:12.660\n Let, you know, the poker gods be kind to me right now.\n\n39:12.660 --> 39:13.500\n Let me win this.\n\n39:13.500 --> 39:14.380\n And it looked good.\n\n39:14.380 --> 39:17.140\n I was in a great situation on the flop,\n\n39:17.140 --> 39:18.260\n great situation on the turn.\n\n39:18.260 --> 39:20.020\n I'm about to be a competitor.\n\n39:20.020 --> 39:21.900\n I'm going to be a contender in this tournament\n\n39:21.900 --> 39:24.620\n to win a big prize pool and turn the whole thing around.\n\n39:24.620 --> 39:26.460\n It's all there for the taking.\n\n39:26.460 --> 39:29.380\n And then boom, the last card, it just, you know,\n\n39:29.380 --> 39:31.500\n it was a couple of weeks of frustration\n\n39:31.500 --> 39:33.820\n in the moment of filming that I just had, you know,\n\n39:33.820 --> 39:35.540\n sort of a visceral reaction, you know,\n\n39:35.540 --> 39:37.780\n and I smacked the, smacked the selfie stick.\n\n39:37.780 --> 39:40.340\n And then like, I, it was, I see a corner, it's safe.\n\n39:40.340 --> 39:41.900\n I threw the selfie stick on the ground.\n\n39:41.900 --> 39:45.180\n And of course, social media blows up about how, you know,\n\n39:45.180 --> 39:47.620\n it was a violent act, you know?\n\n39:47.620 --> 39:49.420\n I mean, it's like, have you never watched sports?\n\n39:49.420 --> 39:51.420\n Have you never seen a guy on the golf course\n\n39:51.420 --> 39:53.420\n smack his club or throw their helmet?\n\n39:53.420 --> 39:55.180\n Like, you know, there was the,\n\n39:55.180 --> 39:57.380\n there's a guy, Justin Bonomo is a poker player.\n\n39:57.380 --> 40:00.580\n And he's a super, how to, for lack of a better word,\n\n40:00.580 --> 40:02.020\n offended by everything.\n\n40:02.020 --> 40:04.740\n And he was equating my throwing a stick on the ground\n\n40:04.740 --> 40:07.500\n to violence against women, domestic abuse,\n\n40:07.500 --> 40:09.180\n and the idea that like,\n\n40:09.180 --> 40:12.060\n this makes women feel unsafe to play poker.\n\n40:12.060 --> 40:13.460\n And so that was kind of a running joke\n\n40:13.460 --> 40:15.820\n for the last two weeks where every time I sat at a table,\n\n40:15.820 --> 40:19.340\n the guys would be like, oh, I feel unsafe, I feel unsafe.\n\n40:19.340 --> 40:20.180\n Yeah.\n\n40:20.180 --> 40:21.020\n Can you take me through the hand?\n\n40:21.020 --> 40:21.840\n Do you remember what the hand was?\n\n40:21.840 --> 40:22.680\n Like, what was the...\n\n40:22.680 --> 40:25.700\n Yeah, so it was a, you know, a player on the button raised.\n\n40:25.700 --> 40:27.460\n David Peters, very aggressive player.\n\n40:27.460 --> 40:29.060\n He went all in from the blind\n\n40:29.060 --> 40:31.060\n and I had a pair of pocket tens.\n\n40:31.060 --> 40:34.100\n So I went with my tens and he had queen 10 of spades.\n\n40:34.100 --> 40:35.380\n So I was good.\n\n40:35.380 --> 40:37.020\n I have way the best hand.\n\n40:37.020 --> 40:40.100\n And the flop was like king nine, three, one spade.\n\n40:40.100 --> 40:42.460\n Turn was like the eight of spades.\n\n40:42.460 --> 40:45.220\n So now he has a flush draw and the river was another spade.\n\n40:45.220 --> 40:47.740\n So he caught spade, spade, and he made a flush.\n\n40:47.740 --> 40:50.660\n Wow, but statistically you were winning the whole time.\n\n40:50.660 --> 40:52.300\n Yeah, I was winning it up until the last card.\n\n40:52.300 --> 40:53.860\n What did he go all in on?\n\n40:53.860 --> 40:54.900\n Was it a bluff?\n\n40:54.900 --> 40:57.140\n He made what's considered like a pretty standard play\n\n40:57.140 --> 40:59.500\n in modern poker where, you know, a guy raised\n\n40:59.500 --> 41:01.500\n and he was just trying to pick up, you know, what was there.\n\n41:01.500 --> 41:03.140\n And he ran into a hand in the big blind\n\n41:03.140 --> 41:04.420\n and you know, he got lucky.\n\n41:04.420 --> 41:08.420\n So what was the throughout the strategy of preparation,\n\n41:08.420 --> 41:09.820\n the strategy of play?\n\n41:09.820 --> 41:12.580\n So you're playing so many days.\n\n41:12.580 --> 41:14.380\n Are you trying to ignore the results\n\n41:14.380 --> 41:16.900\n and stick to a particular strategy?\n\n41:16.900 --> 41:19.500\n Yes, for the most part, you know,\n\n41:19.500 --> 41:21.580\n what I'm trying to do is like,\n\n41:21.580 --> 41:23.260\n I formulate a strategy for the whole seven weeks\n\n41:23.260 --> 41:25.940\n cause there's a varying degree of buy ins too.\n\n41:25.940 --> 41:28.340\n Like you have small ones, like 1500,\n\n41:28.340 --> 41:30.220\n then you've got like $250,000 buy in.\n\n41:30.220 --> 41:33.460\n So I map out the seven weeks and right,\n\n41:33.460 --> 41:36.340\n I'll give a little bit of mental energy to the 1500,\n\n41:36.340 --> 41:37.580\n which means I'll be on my phone.\n\n41:37.580 --> 41:39.700\n I'm not gonna, I don't care as much about this one,\n\n41:39.700 --> 41:43.820\n but the 250K fully engaged, fully focused, you know,\n\n41:43.820 --> 41:45.740\n up against obviously the higher the buy in,\n\n41:45.740 --> 41:48.260\n you know, super top competition.\n\n41:48.260 --> 41:50.940\n And you know, as far as strategy goes,\n\n41:50.940 --> 41:53.940\n focusing on each day, playing the best I can,\n\n41:53.940 --> 41:55.580\n not the result.\n\n41:55.580 --> 41:57.260\n Like, cause if you focus on the result,\n\n41:57.260 --> 41:58.700\n you're focusing in the wrong place.\n\n41:58.700 --> 42:02.020\n Your focus should be on the decisions you actually make.\n\n42:02.020 --> 42:04.620\n Right, and if you're making good decisions consistently,\n\n42:04.620 --> 42:05.700\n you have to continue to do that.\n\n42:05.700 --> 42:06.980\n The frustrating part is this,\n\n42:06.980 --> 42:09.060\n with poker, unlike chess or other things,\n\n42:09.060 --> 42:12.420\n making the best possible decision doesn't mean you win.\n\n42:12.420 --> 42:14.580\n Often you lose, you don't, chess.\n\n42:15.540 --> 42:19.020\n Well, Magnus Carlsen has also talked about that.\n\n42:20.860 --> 42:25.300\n There's some non deterministic thing about chess too,\n\n42:25.300 --> 42:30.260\n given the limited cognitive capacity of the human mind.\n\n42:30.260 --> 42:33.100\n So he says that the world championship should have\n\n42:33.100 --> 42:36.660\n 20, 30, 40, 50 games, not the few that they have.\n\n42:36.660 --> 42:38.300\n It's too low of a sample.\n\n42:38.300 --> 42:41.980\n So in that sense, the high stakes poker tournaments\n\n42:41.980 --> 42:44.300\n are very too low sample.\n\n42:44.300 --> 42:45.340\n Sure, yeah.\n\n42:45.340 --> 42:47.220\n Well, when you think of the world series of poker,\n\n42:47.220 --> 42:49.820\n so as you said, I lost about 1 million, right?\n\n42:49.820 --> 42:52.300\n In one tournament, that was 500,000.\n\n42:52.300 --> 42:53.820\n So then, you know, like a few others here\n\n42:53.820 --> 42:54.660\n of high buying tournaments.\n\n42:54.660 --> 42:57.700\n So the sample or the amount was, you know,\n\n42:57.700 --> 43:00.540\n 40, 50 total tournaments with, you know, high variance.\n\n43:00.540 --> 43:03.340\n And if you don't run well or do well in the highest buy ins,\n\n43:03.340 --> 43:06.060\n you know, you're gonna have a losing summer.\n\n43:06.060 --> 43:08.780\n So you did a podcast on the mental game a few years ago,\n\n43:08.780 --> 43:10.660\n but then that's just something you really care about.\n\n43:10.660 --> 43:13.020\n So what aspects of the mental game in poker\n\n43:13.020 --> 43:15.300\n is most difficult to master?\n\n43:15.300 --> 43:16.940\n I think the most difficult thing for people\n\n43:16.940 --> 43:18.860\n is self awareness, right?\n\n43:18.860 --> 43:21.380\n And resilience, self awareness to know, okay,\n\n43:21.380 --> 43:24.940\n so, you know, again, is it, am I not doing as well\n\n43:24.940 --> 43:26.340\n as I could be because of luck\n\n43:26.340 --> 43:28.020\n or is there things that I can learn?\n\n43:28.020 --> 43:30.220\n And I always look to mistakes as opportunities.\n\n43:30.220 --> 43:31.300\n I really do.\n\n43:31.300 --> 43:34.100\n When I make a mistake in a poker hand, right?\n\n43:34.100 --> 43:36.340\n Call it a breakdown or whatever,\n\n43:36.340 --> 43:38.180\n that's where breakthroughs happen.\n\n43:38.180 --> 43:40.940\n And I'm like, oh, you know what I could have done here?\n\n43:40.940 --> 43:43.620\n I could have done this and that would have been really good\n\n43:43.620 --> 43:44.900\n and I'm gonna do that going forward.\n\n43:44.900 --> 43:48.060\n So I think like with anything, you know,\n\n43:48.060 --> 43:50.060\n when you start out playing golf,\n\n43:50.060 --> 43:52.860\n like your goal is to just hit the ball, right?\n\n43:52.860 --> 43:54.780\n Then you try to hit it in the air,\n\n43:54.780 --> 43:56.220\n then you're trying to hit it straight,\n\n43:56.220 --> 43:57.980\n then you're trying to hit it on the green,\n\n43:57.980 --> 43:59.220\n then you're trying to hit it closer to the green\n\n43:59.220 --> 44:02.180\n to the point where the pros get where, you know,\n\n44:02.180 --> 44:05.180\n they're so finite, they're trying to hit it 63 yards\n\n44:05.180 --> 44:06.940\n and spin it back three yards.\n\n44:06.940 --> 44:08.460\n It's imperfect.\n\n44:08.460 --> 44:10.340\n Like they don't hit the perfect shot\n\n44:10.340 --> 44:12.820\n because the perfect shot for them is it goes in,\n\n44:12.820 --> 44:14.580\n but they try and make the mistakes smaller\n\n44:14.580 --> 44:15.540\n and smaller and smaller.\n\n44:15.540 --> 44:17.060\n Poker is the same.\n\n44:17.060 --> 44:19.180\n We all make mistakes consistently.\n\n44:19.180 --> 44:21.940\n The goal is to minimize, especially the big ones.\n\n44:23.180 --> 44:26.340\n What was the lowest point for you psychologically\n\n44:27.500 --> 44:28.900\n in poker in general, actually?\n\n44:28.900 --> 44:31.220\n Maybe it was this year, maybe it was in general.\n\n44:31.220 --> 44:33.380\n Do you remember there was times in your life,\n\n44:33.380 --> 44:34.860\n speaking of resilience,\n\n44:34.860 --> 44:37.660\n that were extremely difficult to you mentally?\n\n44:37.660 --> 44:41.260\n Yeah, so early on, you know, as basically as a teenager,\n\n44:41.260 --> 44:43.100\n I was playing in Toronto and then in my early 20s,\n\n44:43.100 --> 44:44.780\n I'm like, I'm going to Vegas, right?\n\n44:44.780 --> 44:46.340\n And I thought I was the best.\n\n44:46.340 --> 44:49.620\n I'm like 21 years old, I'm like, check me out, right?\n\n44:49.620 --> 44:54.620\n Show up with $3,000, 24 hours later, you know, money's gone.\n\n44:54.940 --> 44:58.420\n And I remember the moment vividly.\n\n44:58.420 --> 44:59.260\n It was at the Binion's Horse,\n\n44:59.260 --> 45:00.580\n it was about three in the morning.\n\n45:00.580 --> 45:02.740\n I was playing with seven other people.\n\n45:02.740 --> 45:04.580\n You know, I lost my last chips.\n\n45:04.580 --> 45:08.100\n I went to the bathroom, washed up, got out.\n\n45:08.100 --> 45:09.540\n They all left.\n\n45:09.540 --> 45:11.300\n And it was like a moment where I realized like, okay,\n\n45:11.300 --> 45:12.900\n in Toronto, I was the big fish.\n\n45:12.900 --> 45:15.180\n But here, they were playing because of me.\n\n45:15.180 --> 45:16.180\n I was the sucker.\n\n45:16.180 --> 45:17.980\n I remembered every one of their faces.\n\n45:17.980 --> 45:19.500\n And then I remember not having enough money\n\n45:19.500 --> 45:22.100\n to get back to budget suites where I was staying.\n\n45:22.100 --> 45:24.980\n So I walked, you know, I walked.\n\n45:24.980 --> 45:26.500\n And in that moment I was thinking about like,\n\n45:26.500 --> 45:28.020\n is this something that I'll be able to do?\n\n45:28.020 --> 45:29.340\n Am I good enough?\n\n45:29.340 --> 45:30.700\n You know, what am I going to do now?\n\n45:30.700 --> 45:34.020\n I'm in Vegas, I don't know anybody and I have no money,\n\n45:34.020 --> 45:34.860\n right?\n\n45:34.860 --> 45:37.700\n So that was certainly like what felt like a low point,\n\n45:37.700 --> 45:40.180\n walking back behind Paradise and Twain,\n\n45:40.180 --> 45:41.940\n which is not a great part of town.\n\n45:43.100 --> 45:46.300\n Where did you find the strength to answer yes\n\n45:46.300 --> 45:48.940\n to that question that you can still do good?\n\n45:48.940 --> 45:51.100\n I think this has been sort of a pattern in my life\n\n45:51.100 --> 45:53.580\n where like in the evening after it happens,\n\n45:53.580 --> 45:54.780\n like I don't have it.\n\n45:54.780 --> 45:57.700\n You know, I don't have that feeling of hope or,\n\n45:57.700 --> 45:59.420\n you know, resilience, if you will.\n\n45:59.420 --> 46:02.500\n I'm allowing myself to experience despair,\n\n46:02.500 --> 46:04.260\n which is exactly where I'm at.\n\n46:04.260 --> 46:06.980\n But then a good night's sleep, wake up the next morning\n\n46:06.980 --> 46:10.060\n and just within me, I have that inner confidence to say,\n\n46:10.060 --> 46:10.900\n you know what?\n\n46:10.900 --> 46:13.180\n Fuck it, get back on the hobby horse,\n\n46:13.180 --> 46:15.860\n find a way, make it work, right?\n\n46:15.860 --> 46:19.060\n But I do believe it's really therapeutic and worthwhile\n\n46:19.060 --> 46:21.740\n to allow yourself to feel and vent.\n\n46:21.740 --> 46:24.500\n So many people today, the Instagram culture world,\n\n46:24.500 --> 46:26.820\n I call it, it's like they want to act like they're perfect.\n\n46:26.820 --> 46:28.860\n Nothing bothers them, bullshit, right?\n\n46:28.860 --> 46:30.500\n You're pissed off, it's okay to show it.\n\n46:30.500 --> 46:32.260\n Emotion's fine, we all have it.\n\n46:32.260 --> 46:34.140\n There's no reason you have to suppress it.\n\n46:34.140 --> 46:36.380\n Obviously, you don't want to have guys throwing selfie sticks\n\n46:36.380 --> 46:39.060\n around the room every time they lose a pot, right?\n\n46:39.060 --> 46:40.900\n But, you know, a little bit of...\n\n46:40.900 --> 46:42.420\n You're gonna make everybody feel unsafe.\n\n46:42.420 --> 46:43.260\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n46:43.260 --> 46:44.420\n That happens.\n\n46:44.420 --> 46:46.740\n So you're saying, there is a culture of saying,\n\n46:46.740 --> 46:48.380\n you know, stay positive, all this kind of stuff,\n\n46:48.380 --> 46:52.020\n but you know, when you feel despair, don't resist it,\n\n46:52.020 --> 46:52.940\n ride it out.\n\n46:52.940 --> 46:54.860\n Because it doesn't go away, right?\n\n46:54.860 --> 46:56.300\n That feeling, you know, you think you put it away\n\n46:56.300 --> 46:57.820\n in the pit of your stomach and you think, you know,\n\n46:57.820 --> 46:59.460\n it's gone, it's not, it's still there.\n\n46:59.460 --> 47:00.940\n Let yourself go, fuck!\n\n47:00.940 --> 47:01.780\n Yeah.\n\n47:01.780 --> 47:02.740\n It's all right.\n\n47:02.740 --> 47:05.060\n You know, there's nothing wrong with being\n\n47:05.060 --> 47:07.120\n a little bit emotional, because once you've experienced it,\n\n47:07.120 --> 47:10.120\n you let it out, now you can move past it.\n\n47:10.120 --> 47:12.740\n Yeah, and I feel like, as long as your brain chemistry\n\n47:12.740 --> 47:16.620\n can support it, you can usually learn a good lesson\n\n47:16.620 --> 47:18.660\n from it, like you become stronger,\n\n47:18.660 --> 47:20.300\n you become more resilient through it.\n\n47:20.300 --> 47:21.260\n It's really interesting.\n\n47:21.260 --> 47:23.080\n And a good night's sleep can really help.\n\n47:23.080 --> 47:24.680\n Absolutely, yeah.\n\n47:24.680 --> 47:29.560\n So through 2022, and in general, what is a perfect day\n\n47:29.560 --> 47:31.460\n in the life of Daniel Negrano look like\n\n47:31.460 --> 47:34.940\n when you're, like on a day when you have to play\n\n47:34.940 --> 47:37.620\n a big game, big tournament game and so on?\n\n47:37.620 --> 47:39.820\n So like, what time do you wake up?\n\n47:39.820 --> 47:41.220\n What do you eat for breakfast?\n\n47:41.220 --> 47:43.660\n So my life is twofold.\n\n47:43.660 --> 47:47.360\n Like one, when I'm playing hardcore, and one when I'm not.\n\n47:47.360 --> 47:49.340\n And they look very different, right?\n\n47:49.340 --> 47:51.860\n So I'll give you a quick glimpse of like when I'm not,\n\n47:51.860 --> 47:55.820\n up at 10, you know, breakfast, in the gym at noon,\n\n47:55.820 --> 47:58.780\n you know, post workout,\n\n47:58.780 --> 48:03.780\n meal, coffee, walk, like, you know, I try to get,\n\n48:04.460 --> 48:06.140\n that's what I do for cardio, you know,\n\n48:06.140 --> 48:07.340\n and just very like home bodied.\n\n48:07.340 --> 48:08.260\n I don't leave the house.\n\n48:08.260 --> 48:10.660\n It's very like boring and mundane, right?\n\n48:10.660 --> 48:11.580\n Long distance walks.\n\n48:11.580 --> 48:13.060\n So like, what do you do when you're walking?\n\n48:13.060 --> 48:14.060\n You're thinking about stuff?\n\n48:14.060 --> 48:15.740\n Well, no, honestly, I just walk on the treadmill.\n\n48:15.740 --> 48:17.980\n I try to get 15,000 steps a day.\n\n48:17.980 --> 48:19.740\n And I just walk for basically like an hour\n\n48:19.740 --> 48:21.620\n while I watch a show or I'm on the computer\n\n48:21.620 --> 48:23.460\n or something like that, you know, I'm on the treadmill.\n\n48:23.460 --> 48:25.580\n Why walk and not running?\n\n48:25.580 --> 48:27.580\n Well, I mean, I think walking, I mean,\n\n48:27.580 --> 48:29.380\n I do a little bit of running, but hardly any.\n\n48:29.380 --> 48:30.660\n I don't enjoy it.\n\n48:30.660 --> 48:31.900\n Like, I just like walking.\n\n48:31.900 --> 48:33.180\n And frankly, for fat loss,\n\n48:33.180 --> 48:36.220\n when it's usually what I'm doing after big poker tournaments\n\n48:36.220 --> 48:40.140\n is getting back in shape, that walking's ideal for it, right?\n\n48:40.140 --> 48:41.700\n So essentially it's like the tale of two.\n\n48:41.700 --> 48:43.580\n During the World Series of Poker,\n\n48:43.580 --> 48:47.740\n all my sort of structured life thrown out the window.\n\n48:47.740 --> 48:48.860\n There's no walking.\n\n48:48.860 --> 48:50.180\n There's very little walking.\n\n48:50.180 --> 48:51.340\n There's very little working out.\n\n48:51.340 --> 48:52.180\n There's very little anything.\n\n48:52.180 --> 48:54.140\n I go into the World Series, you know,\n\n48:54.140 --> 48:57.460\n like this year I went in around 157\n\n48:57.460 --> 48:59.420\n and I expected to gain about 10 pounds\n\n48:59.420 --> 49:00.260\n during the World Series.\n\n49:00.260 --> 49:01.940\n Not good pounds, it wasn't muscle,\n\n49:01.940 --> 49:03.700\n but that's about what I did, 165.\n\n49:03.700 --> 49:06.580\n And then I spend the next month trying to, you know, lose it.\n\n49:06.580 --> 49:08.500\n But during the World Series, when I'm playing,\n\n49:08.500 --> 49:10.860\n the most important thing without question\n\n49:10.860 --> 49:12.060\n that I have to focus on,\n\n49:12.060 --> 49:13.980\n and this is why I stopped focusing\n\n49:13.980 --> 49:16.460\n on working on all this stuff is sleep.\n\n49:16.460 --> 49:18.380\n If I'm not rested, I'm useless.\n\n49:18.380 --> 49:20.380\n If I only get five, six hours\n\n49:20.380 --> 49:23.500\n and I have to go back the next day and play 14 hours,\n\n49:23.500 --> 49:26.460\n the chances of me being at my best, very, very slim.\n\n49:26.460 --> 49:27.500\n So sleep is a priority.\n\n49:27.500 --> 49:30.060\n What's the perfect amount of sleep for you on those days?\n\n49:30.060 --> 49:30.900\n Eight, seven?\n\n49:30.900 --> 49:33.980\n So eight hours is my go to every night.\n\n49:33.980 --> 49:36.540\n During the World Series of Poker, it's just not possible\n\n49:36.540 --> 49:37.900\n because of the way that it's structured.\n\n49:37.900 --> 49:40.980\n Sometimes the tournaments end at 2.15 a.m.\n\n49:40.980 --> 49:44.340\n I get home about three o clock.\n\n49:44.340 --> 49:46.900\n Takes me 30 minutes, 40 minutes to get to sleep.\n\n49:46.900 --> 49:48.780\n So now let's say I'm in bed by four.\n\n49:48.780 --> 49:51.660\n Well, the tournament's at, you know, two.\n\n49:51.660 --> 49:53.540\n So I have to get up and whatever.\n\n49:53.540 --> 49:55.060\n So it's very difficult to get exactly eight\n\n49:55.060 --> 49:56.100\n a lot of the time.\n\n49:56.100 --> 49:57.660\n You know, and also get back there in time.\n\n49:57.660 --> 50:01.380\n Is there any hacks to quiet the mind?\n\n50:01.380 --> 50:04.580\n Because you're going on a pretty intense rollercoaster\n\n50:04.580 --> 50:06.500\n mentally when you're playing.\n\n50:07.780 --> 50:10.100\n Is there any tricks to getting to sleep\n\n50:10.100 --> 50:10.940\n given the rollercoaster?\n\n50:10.940 --> 50:12.060\n I've been very lucky.\n\n50:12.060 --> 50:12.900\n Like I'm blessed.\n\n50:12.900 --> 50:14.700\n I don't know if it's because of diet or what,\n\n50:14.700 --> 50:16.700\n but I've always been a very good sleeper.\n\n50:16.700 --> 50:17.580\n You just shut off.\n\n50:17.580 --> 50:19.980\n I get to sleep and I sleep like a baby, you know?\n\n50:19.980 --> 50:21.840\n And I also nap really well.\n\n50:21.840 --> 50:23.660\n Like during the World Series, sometimes what will happen\n\n50:23.660 --> 50:26.340\n is let's say I get knocked out of one event at 4 p.m.\n\n50:26.340 --> 50:28.460\n And there's another one that I can jump in.\n\n50:28.460 --> 50:30.100\n Instead of jumping right into it,\n\n50:30.100 --> 50:34.220\n I'll go into like a private room and take 45 minute nap.\n\n50:34.220 --> 50:36.980\n And you know, and give me enough energy to continue\n\n50:36.980 --> 50:38.300\n and sort of reset my mind.\n\n50:38.300 --> 50:41.060\n Yeah, and it solves a lot of problems with the nap too.\n\n50:41.060 --> 50:41.900\n It does.\n\n50:41.900 --> 50:46.180\n Yeah, I feel like the nap is a magical trick in life.\n\n50:46.180 --> 50:47.540\n What else, diet wise?\n\n50:47.540 --> 50:52.220\n What do you, your mind is going, you know,\n\n50:52.220 --> 50:53.980\n pretty intensely all day.\n\n50:53.980 --> 50:55.860\n Yeah, so during like, like I said,\n\n50:55.860 --> 50:58.740\n when I'm not playing, I'm super regimented.\n\n50:58.740 --> 51:01.740\n You know, I have, I literally measure everything.\n\n51:01.740 --> 51:04.420\n You know, I count calories, I count macros,\n\n51:04.420 --> 51:05.900\n I follow it to a T.\n\n51:05.900 --> 51:07.420\n Pretty balanced diet or any?\n\n51:07.420 --> 51:08.260\n I'm a vegan.\n\n51:08.260 --> 51:09.100\n Vegan, yeah.\n\n51:09.100 --> 51:10.540\n So it's, you know, a vegan diet, like.\n\n51:10.540 --> 51:12.140\n But balanced in terms of carbs and protein.\n\n51:12.140 --> 51:13.980\n Yeah, yeah, no, I mean, I eat a healthy amount.\n\n51:13.980 --> 51:16.820\n I'm doing probably 150 grams of protein,\n\n51:17.820 --> 51:20.140\n like 60 grams of fat, 50, and then about.\n\n51:20.140 --> 51:21.460\n And try to measure it all out.\n\n51:21.460 --> 51:23.460\n I do, yeah, I basically, I created a meal plan.\n\n51:23.460 --> 51:24.700\n So what I did for myself is,\n\n51:24.700 --> 51:26.780\n cause I'm really anal and I made a spreadsheet\n\n51:26.780 --> 51:29.660\n with like a day's food and I have six different ones.\n\n51:29.660 --> 51:30.940\n So I just follow it.\n\n51:30.940 --> 51:34.580\n Like I don't, it actually makes my life so much easier\n\n51:34.580 --> 51:35.860\n when I don't have to think about what I'm going to eat\n\n51:35.860 --> 51:37.060\n for lunch or what I'm going to eat for dinner.\n\n51:37.060 --> 51:38.100\n I already know what I'm going to eat.\n\n51:38.100 --> 51:40.300\n I already wrote it down and it doesn't get boring\n\n51:40.300 --> 51:42.460\n because I'm switching it up every day, you know,\n\n51:42.460 --> 51:45.140\n every six days and occasionally I'll, you know,\n\n51:45.140 --> 51:46.300\n splurge or do something different.\n\n51:46.300 --> 51:47.900\n During the World Series of Poker,\n\n51:47.900 --> 51:50.140\n I eat whatever the fuck I want to eat.\n\n51:50.140 --> 51:52.820\n Like it's at 2 a.m. I don't crave\n\n51:52.820 --> 51:54.900\n like a broccoli carrot salad.\n\n51:54.900 --> 51:58.660\n Like I want chocolate, candy and chips.\n\n51:58.660 --> 51:59.500\n So I'll just do it.\n\n51:59.500 --> 52:01.340\n So you listen to the cravings.\n\n52:01.340 --> 52:02.900\n Yeah, I realized like.\n\n52:02.900 --> 52:04.180\n It's surprising because like,\n\n52:04.180 --> 52:06.580\n you're so regimented outside of that.\n\n52:06.580 --> 52:07.740\n It's really difficult.\n\n52:07.740 --> 52:08.860\n Like I've done it before\n\n52:08.860 --> 52:10.420\n where I played the World Series of Poker\n\n52:10.420 --> 52:13.140\n and I made it a point to work out every day.\n\n52:13.140 --> 52:15.780\n But what that did was it sacrificed sleep.\n\n52:15.780 --> 52:18.780\n So then I found like at 1 a.m. I would be more tired,\n\n52:18.780 --> 52:20.620\n you know, because I've expended more energy\n\n52:20.620 --> 52:21.460\n than I would otherwise.\n\n52:21.460 --> 52:23.740\n So I essentially like look at the World Series\n\n52:23.740 --> 52:25.220\n is six, seven weeks where my body's\n\n52:25.220 --> 52:27.940\n just gonna take a beating, not like UFC fighter,\n\n52:27.940 --> 52:29.380\n but like a different kind of beating.\n\n52:29.380 --> 52:31.620\n And that's okay because I have so much confidence\n\n52:31.620 --> 52:34.980\n that within six weeks of just like eating right\n\n52:34.980 --> 52:36.820\n and working out, I can get back to where I was.\n\n52:36.820 --> 52:39.100\n But it's just hilarious to me that you'd be eating chocolate.\n\n52:39.100 --> 52:40.420\n What eating chocolate in bed\n\n52:40.420 --> 52:42.820\n as you're trying to get to sleep is this.\n\n52:42.820 --> 52:45.580\n Like literally a bag of like chips or chocolate,\n\n52:45.580 --> 52:48.260\n like on my way home and before bed,\n\n52:48.260 --> 52:49.300\n you know, just whatever.\n\n52:49.300 --> 52:51.340\n This is what the professional athlete does\n\n52:51.340 --> 52:54.060\n at the highest, most difficult event of his career.\n\n52:54.060 --> 52:58.620\n Okay, so what else is there in terms of mental preparation\n\n52:58.620 --> 53:01.380\n and focus and meditation, those kinds of things\n\n53:01.380 --> 53:03.100\n leading up to the games?\n\n53:03.100 --> 53:05.260\n Is there anything you like to,\n\n53:05.260 --> 53:07.860\n like any rituals you like to follow?\n\n53:07.860 --> 53:10.100\n So yeah, I have dabbled in the past\n\n53:10.100 --> 53:11.740\n with like meditation and different things like that.\n\n53:11.740 --> 53:13.540\n And I know that there's health benefits to it.\n\n53:13.540 --> 53:16.340\n And I understand that a lot of people get a lot from it\n\n53:16.340 --> 53:18.540\n and I've done it for a good amount of time,\n\n53:18.540 --> 53:20.340\n like long periods of time.\n\n53:20.340 --> 53:23.740\n I found that for me, I think it was predominantly placebo.\n\n53:23.740 --> 53:26.380\n Like it really wasn't doing anything for me\n\n53:26.380 --> 53:28.540\n that I felt like it was, it felt like I was doing something,\n\n53:28.540 --> 53:31.860\n but I really, I didn't see any specific results from it.\n\n53:31.860 --> 53:33.980\n So I don't really do that too much.\n\n53:33.980 --> 53:37.340\n One thing that I will do for me is leading up\n\n53:37.340 --> 53:39.260\n is there's so much footage now\n\n53:39.260 --> 53:42.260\n that I'll make it a point to like watch my opponents\n\n53:42.260 --> 53:45.620\n and then with like my phone, I'll take notes\n\n53:45.620 --> 53:47.980\n and I'll keep track of different things that I'm seeing.\n\n53:47.980 --> 53:49.500\n And that sort of, and then what I'll do\n\n53:49.500 --> 53:50.940\n is I'll formulate a game plan.\n\n53:50.940 --> 53:52.940\n Like I'm playing the Poker Masters coming up\n\n53:52.940 --> 53:54.100\n in about a week.\n\n53:54.100 --> 53:55.900\n And I'll look to see the tendencies\n\n53:55.900 --> 53:56.780\n of what my opponents are doing.\n\n53:56.780 --> 53:58.540\n And then I'll come up with like some things\n\n53:58.540 --> 54:00.500\n that I'm gonna do, some tricks of the trade, if you will.\n\n54:00.500 --> 54:02.380\n Not game theory optimal stuff,\n\n54:02.380 --> 54:04.540\n stuff that I think, oh, they're making a mistake here\n\n54:04.540 --> 54:05.900\n that I can exploit.\n\n54:05.900 --> 54:07.900\n And then I look to do that in different ways\n\n54:07.900 --> 54:11.700\n and always look to throw curve balls.\n\n54:11.700 --> 54:14.220\n How hard is that process?\n\n54:14.220 --> 54:16.180\n Do you enjoy it or is it like really hard work\n\n54:16.180 --> 54:18.980\n to analyze the players to try to understand\n\n54:18.980 --> 54:20.100\n what are the different holes?\n\n54:20.100 --> 54:21.100\n What are the different mistakes?\n\n54:21.100 --> 54:23.700\n What are the strengths to avoid and that kind of stuff?\n\n54:23.700 --> 54:25.580\n I think the only thing that makes it harder\n\n54:25.580 --> 54:27.340\n is when you're young, right?\n\n54:27.340 --> 54:28.180\n And you're in your twenties\n\n54:28.180 --> 54:29.820\n and you're trying to make your nest egg.\n\n54:29.820 --> 54:31.700\n You're like, you're trying to make your retirement money.\n\n54:31.700 --> 54:32.860\n You're hungry, right?\n\n54:32.860 --> 54:35.380\n You're like clubber Lang and you know the gym, you're hungry.\n\n54:35.380 --> 54:37.380\n Whereas, you know, Rocky's in there taking pictures\n\n54:37.380 --> 54:39.860\n and smiling and doing commercials and stuff like that.\n\n54:39.860 --> 54:42.380\n So I am 47, I'm financially okay.\n\n54:42.380 --> 54:44.020\n I don't need to win.\n\n54:44.020 --> 54:46.140\n I don't need to compete at the highest levels.\n\n54:46.140 --> 54:47.540\n So I think it was a boxer.\n\n54:47.540 --> 54:48.900\n I don't remember which one.\n\n54:48.900 --> 54:51.500\n When asked this, he was asked the question,\n\n54:51.500 --> 54:53.020\n how do you get up in the morning still\n\n54:53.020 --> 54:54.660\n and do those morning runs?\n\n54:54.660 --> 54:55.500\n And he says, you know what?\n\n54:55.500 --> 54:56.460\n I'll be honest with you.\n\n54:56.460 --> 54:58.780\n It's a lot more difficult doing the 4 a.m. run\n\n54:58.780 --> 55:00.700\n in silk pajamas, right?\n\n55:00.700 --> 55:02.020\n It just is, right?\n\n55:02.020 --> 55:05.700\n But I've always been self motivated\n\n55:05.700 --> 55:07.020\n and I've always found a way.\n\n55:07.020 --> 55:10.900\n So it's harder in the sense of like, it's not a need.\n\n55:10.900 --> 55:12.940\n I can still get by without it.\n\n55:12.940 --> 55:15.540\n But so in that regard, it does feel like a little bit\n\n55:15.540 --> 55:16.700\n of work where like, oh my God,\n\n55:16.700 --> 55:18.900\n that's a lot of footage I gotta get through.\n\n55:18.900 --> 55:20.300\n And I don't know that I have the time or I don't know\n\n55:20.300 --> 55:23.980\n that I wanna spend 10 hours of my day doing that\n\n55:23.980 --> 55:25.620\n when I could be doing other things.\n\n55:25.620 --> 55:28.980\n I mean, what do you still love about poker?\n\n55:28.980 --> 55:30.500\n When you said, when you enter,\n\n55:30.500 --> 55:34.380\n like the times you catch yourself just being able\n\n55:34.380 --> 55:37.820\n to sort of take in the awe of it.\n\n55:37.820 --> 55:39.260\n What aspects do you love?\n\n55:39.260 --> 55:40.380\n I think that like for me,\n\n55:40.380 --> 55:42.100\n I've always been really competitive,\n\n55:42.100 --> 55:44.060\n but I was never gonna be a professional athlete\n\n55:44.060 --> 55:45.140\n or a professional snooker player.\n\n55:45.140 --> 55:46.740\n I wasn't good enough at any of that stuff.\n\n55:46.740 --> 55:49.100\n I didn't have the body type, whatever.\n\n55:49.100 --> 55:51.540\n But poker, it sort of levels the playing field, right?\n\n55:51.540 --> 55:54.220\n You're six, five, 240, big deal.\n\n55:54.220 --> 55:55.860\n We're not fighting here.\n\n55:55.860 --> 55:57.540\n We're fighting a different type of war.\n\n55:57.540 --> 55:58.940\n So the competitive aspect,\n\n55:58.940 --> 56:02.660\n I also have always been fueled throughout my career\n\n56:02.660 --> 56:04.180\n by doubters.\n\n56:04.180 --> 56:05.660\n So this is probably unhealthy,\n\n56:05.660 --> 56:09.020\n but every time people say like, you're done,\n\n56:09.020 --> 56:10.460\n you're washed up, you can't win anymore,\n\n56:10.460 --> 56:13.580\n it just makes me wanna prove them wrong, right?\n\n56:13.580 --> 56:15.260\n So I have a little bit of that in me,\n\n56:15.260 --> 56:17.060\n which again, you're reading the comments\n\n56:17.060 --> 56:17.900\n and all these kinds of,\n\n56:17.900 --> 56:19.680\n like I've been told many times throughout my career\n\n56:19.680 --> 56:21.180\n for the last 15 that I'm done.\n\n56:21.180 --> 56:22.540\n I can't compete anymore.\n\n56:22.540 --> 56:27.260\n And I enjoy proving them wrong.\n\n56:27.260 --> 56:29.940\n Yeah, the game has changed so much.\n\n56:31.780 --> 56:34.340\n The greats of the past surely cannot be the greats\n\n56:34.340 --> 56:35.180\n of the present.\n\n56:35.180 --> 56:38.820\n That kind of commentary will continue for every sport.\n\n56:38.820 --> 56:40.020\n And certainly for poker,\n\n56:40.020 --> 56:42.100\n because poker really changed a lot\n\n56:42.100 --> 56:43.700\n over the past couple of decades.\n\n56:43.700 --> 56:45.660\n Can you speak to how much it has changed?\n\n56:45.660 --> 56:46.500\n Yeah.\n\n56:46.500 --> 56:47.420\n Because you've been at the top for so long.\n\n56:47.420 --> 56:49.380\n Yeah, so complacency is a big issue\n\n56:49.380 --> 56:51.360\n for people who make it, if you will, right?\n\n56:51.360 --> 56:54.300\n So in my era of the poker boom, around the early 2000s,\n\n56:54.300 --> 56:56.500\n there was a group of players who were the big names,\n\n56:56.500 --> 56:57.700\n the stars of the game.\n\n56:57.700 --> 57:01.380\n Well, a lot of them had their egos out of whack\n\n57:01.380 --> 57:03.920\n where they just felt like, okay, I'm the best, that's it.\n\n57:03.920 --> 57:05.620\n Like, no, there's young guys learning,\n\n57:05.620 --> 57:07.900\n there's new software, there's solvers,\n\n57:07.900 --> 57:08.740\n there's all these kinds of things.\n\n57:08.740 --> 57:11.100\n And if you're not keeping up, then you'll get surpassed.\n\n57:11.100 --> 57:14.140\n And I remember myself at a very early age saying,\n\n57:14.140 --> 57:15.300\n I never want to be that guy.\n\n57:15.300 --> 57:17.820\n And it was one of my first events in the late 90s.\n\n57:17.820 --> 57:21.020\n I was the young buck playing with the Tom McAvoy's\n\n57:21.020 --> 57:23.500\n and Brad Doughty, the guys of the era, right?\n\n57:23.500 --> 57:25.420\n And I was doing things more aggressively\n\n57:25.420 --> 57:27.900\n and they were scoffing at all these young kids\n\n57:27.900 --> 57:29.900\n with their aggressive three and all this stuff.\n\n57:29.900 --> 57:31.120\n And they were sort of mocking it, you know?\n\n57:31.120 --> 57:33.180\n And I thought, never be that guy.\n\n57:33.180 --> 57:35.920\n Always have the humility to be introspective\n\n57:35.920 --> 57:38.140\n and always have the respect for your opponents\n\n57:38.140 --> 57:41.180\n that while you think you've got it all figured out,\n\n57:41.180 --> 57:43.340\n they're learning new things and you can learn from them.\n\n57:43.340 --> 57:46.540\n So I've always been willing to sort of swallow my pride\n\n57:46.540 --> 57:48.780\n and get coached by younger players\n\n57:48.780 --> 57:50.240\n who I might even be better than,\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:53.260\n but they see blind spots that I have that I might not.\n\n57:53.260 --> 57:55.220\n And they, you know, they helped me improve my game.\n\n57:55.220 --> 57:57.900\n I've always been willing to sort of look every six months\n\n57:57.900 --> 57:59.300\n or a year and say, is what I'm doing working?\n\n57:59.300 --> 58:01.620\n And if not, how do I get better?\n\n58:01.620 --> 58:06.320\n But most people from my generation, they go the other way.\n\n58:06.320 --> 58:07.420\n I don't know, they just have this idea\n\n58:07.420 --> 58:08.260\n that they figured it all out.\n\n58:08.260 --> 58:10.020\n Once you feel like you've mastered it,\n\n58:10.020 --> 58:10.860\n there's nothing left to learn.\n\n58:10.860 --> 58:12.540\n That's the moment where everyone else\n\n58:12.540 --> 58:13.640\n starts to surpass you.\n\n58:14.820 --> 58:17.780\n That's the moment where you lose the mastery\n\n58:17.780 --> 58:18.860\n because it's always evolving.\n\n58:18.860 --> 58:20.660\n How has the game changed?\n\n58:20.660 --> 58:21.620\n So the game has changed\n\n58:21.620 --> 58:23.780\n in terms of the way people learn it, right?\n\n58:23.780 --> 58:25.660\n When I started out, the only way to learn how to play poker\n\n58:25.660 --> 58:28.380\n was to sit your ass on the chair and play.\n\n58:28.380 --> 58:29.200\n In person?\n\n58:29.200 --> 58:31.060\n Yes, in person, play.\n\n58:31.060 --> 58:32.820\n Maybe you jot down hands on a notepad.\n\n58:32.820 --> 58:34.740\n We didn't even have cell phones back then, right?\n\n58:34.740 --> 58:36.380\n So I would write notes.\n\n58:36.380 --> 58:37.860\n I actually brought a notepad.\n\n58:37.860 --> 58:39.100\n And then you don't analyze it\n\n58:39.100 --> 58:41.340\n and sort of try to figure it out that way\n\n58:41.340 --> 58:44.580\n and think about maybe talking to friends\n\n58:44.580 --> 58:45.520\n and different players.\n\n58:45.520 --> 58:47.220\n Like when I grew up, there was John Jawanda,\n\n58:47.220 --> 58:48.700\n Alan Cunningham and Phil Ivey.\n\n58:48.700 --> 58:50.580\n And we would sort of create\n\n58:50.580 --> 58:52.220\n like a little bit of a mastermind.\n\n58:52.220 --> 58:53.220\n Well, how would you play this hand?\n\n58:53.220 --> 58:54.060\n What would you do here?\n\n58:54.060 --> 58:56.080\n That was the extent of it, right?\n\n58:56.080 --> 58:57.900\n We never had the correct answers.\n\n58:57.900 --> 59:00.480\n We always had theories about what might be right.\n\n59:00.480 --> 59:03.180\n Not until about five, six years ago\n\n59:03.180 --> 59:04.580\n where everything changed.\n\n59:04.580 --> 59:07.500\n Where artificial intelligence created solvers\n\n59:07.500 --> 59:11.020\n that will specifically say, okay, this is the optimal play.\n\n59:11.020 --> 59:12.780\n This is the game theory optimal play.\n\n59:12.780 --> 59:16.180\n So now it introduced poker to a whole new group\n\n59:16.180 --> 59:18.500\n of like personality types.\n\n59:18.500 --> 59:21.440\n In my day, it was people that were dregs of society\n\n59:21.440 --> 59:24.220\n that didn't fit in, not college goers with a degree.\n\n59:24.220 --> 59:26.540\n These are people who were street hustlers playing pool.\n\n59:26.540 --> 59:29.640\n They found poker and they had these unique lives, right?\n\n59:29.640 --> 59:32.740\n But now because poker can be studied,\n\n59:32.740 --> 59:35.300\n much like you study university or college,\n\n59:35.300 --> 59:37.440\n you had, for example, the German contingent\n\n59:37.440 --> 59:39.300\n who was literally analyzing data\n\n59:39.300 --> 59:41.300\n and coming up with strategies based on this.\n\n59:41.300 --> 59:42.620\n And it's like, what?\n\n59:42.620 --> 59:45.780\n And the old guy, got to play by feel or whatever.\n\n59:45.780 --> 59:47.340\n And they're like, they're learning.\n\n59:47.340 --> 59:49.460\n So I guess the way that you describe it is like\n\n59:49.460 --> 59:52.140\n in the old days, it required skill and talent,\n\n59:52.140 --> 59:53.860\n a card sense, right?\n\n59:53.860 --> 59:55.100\n That was the only way to become good.\n\n59:55.100 --> 59:56.960\n And today that's not the case.\n\n59:56.960 --> 59:59.540\n Good study habits, a good work ethic in that regard\n\n59:59.540 --> 1:00:01.220\n can make you like a really good player.\n\n1:00:01.220 --> 1:00:05.020\n Even if you aren't all that talented or gifted,\n\n1:00:05.020 --> 1:00:07.460\n having a good work ethic is a talent, right?\n\n1:00:07.460 --> 1:00:09.860\n Not necessarily card sense, but if you're able to put\n\n1:00:09.860 --> 1:00:12.180\n in the work and study from these solvers,\n\n1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:15.420\n you essentially have the perfect study tool now\n\n1:00:15.420 --> 1:00:17.160\n that we didn't have in my day.\n\n1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:19.900\n So what do the solvers give you?\n\n1:00:19.900 --> 1:00:22.120\n Do you start to memorize the optimal play\n\n1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:24.120\n for every single hand?\n\n1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:25.300\n You try your best.\n\n1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:28.720\n So again, solvers are imperfect as well,\n\n1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:32.700\n in terms of the way the humans utilize them, right?\n\n1:00:32.700 --> 1:00:36.860\n Because you can give solvers a certain number of inputs\n\n1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:38.500\n in terms of what you want it to solve,\n\n1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:40.900\n but a solver can think on many, many levels.\n\n1:00:40.900 --> 1:00:43.240\n So for example, the way that a typical player\n\n1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:45.580\n would do a solve is to say, okay,\n\n1:00:45.580 --> 1:00:47.860\n what does a solver think is the best play here?\n\n1:00:47.860 --> 1:00:50.700\n Bet one third pot, bet two thirds pot,\n\n1:00:50.700 --> 1:00:52.580\n or bet one and a half times pot, okay?\n\n1:00:52.580 --> 1:00:55.820\n You give it three parameters, it comes out with an output\n\n1:00:55.820 --> 1:00:57.420\n and it tells you what you should do\n\n1:00:57.420 --> 1:00:59.320\n with all the different hands you have.\n\n1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:01.820\n However, that's a simplified version\n\n1:01:01.820 --> 1:01:02.940\n of what a solver would really do,\n\n1:01:02.940 --> 1:01:04.580\n because a solver might decide\n\n1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:08.100\n that seven times the pot is best, 10% of the pot.\n\n1:01:08.100 --> 1:01:09.860\n But when you're putting in a solve,\n\n1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:12.540\n you can only put in specific parameters.\n\n1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:14.900\n So that's why, frankly, that's typically the number,\n\n1:01:14.900 --> 1:01:17.140\n one third, two third, and one and a half times pot\n\n1:01:17.140 --> 1:01:18.500\n is what people often do.\n\n1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:21.860\n So they sort of have a vague idea of what a solver wants.\n\n1:01:21.860 --> 1:01:26.660\n But again, imperfect in terms of the implementation of it.\n\n1:01:26.660 --> 1:01:29.060\n And memorizing all the variables,\n\n1:01:29.060 --> 1:01:31.780\n like that King Jack offsuit with the King of Diamonds\n\n1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:35.800\n is 13%, no human brain can do that.\n\n1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:37.500\n So what you do is you bucket it.\n\n1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:41.000\n Like you bucket it into say, instead of 10,000 variables,\n\n1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.580\n you have 10 buckets and you say, okay,\n\n1:01:42.580 --> 1:01:44.100\n with these hands, we do roughly this,\n\n1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:45.140\n and we do roughly this.\n\n1:01:45.140 --> 1:01:48.260\n And you try your best to stay within those lines.\n\n1:01:48.260 --> 1:01:50.460\n But again, what I love about live poker partly\n\n1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:54.560\n is that nobody will ever be able to master game theory,\n\n1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:57.800\n and mimic a solver.\n\n1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:02.800\n But you also have to incorporate your position,\n\n1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:06.460\n where you are, and obviously what cards you have,\n\n1:02:06.460 --> 1:02:08.920\n but also the size of your stack,\n\n1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:09.920\n how much money you have,\n\n1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:12.440\n and also whether you have the ability\n\n1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:15.460\n or desire to buy in, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:17.600\n So you have to calculate all of that, right?\n\n1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:20.440\n So the solver will do that, right?\n\n1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:23.120\n And essentially, you don't input your hand.\n\n1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:25.600\n It tells you, you'll look at the grade,\n\n1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:27.320\n and be like, all right, this is my hand,\n\n1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:28.160\n and it tells you what it is.\n\n1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:30.960\n But it tells you what you would do with any hand, right?\n\n1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:32.280\n It gives you the full output.\n\n1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:34.040\n And that actually gives you a better idea,\n\n1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:36.800\n because you're ultimately, like you said,\n\n1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:39.400\n playing a range of hands, not a hand.\n\n1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:41.240\n And the solvers do things that are really interesting.\n\n1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:43.040\n You've seen AlphaGo, I would imagine.\n\n1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:44.680\n Brilliant film, right, I thought.\n\n1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:46.920\n And I thought what was interesting is there was,\n\n1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:50.280\n you know, accepted theory from all the top Go players,\n\n1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:51.160\n this is what you do.\n\n1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:54.360\n But the AI was doing things way different,\n\n1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:55.720\n and they're like, this has to be wrong,\n\n1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:56.880\n but really it wasn't.\n\n1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:00.760\n So for example, a solver may say this, right?\n\n1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:04.360\n Let's say you bet on the end, and you bet a lot,\n\n1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:07.460\n and a solver may say, you should fold here\n\n1:03:07.460 --> 1:03:10.040\n with a pair of kings and a queen kicker,\n\n1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:12.000\n which is, you know, a pair of kings,\n\n1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.080\n but call with a pair of fours and an ace kicker.\n\n1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:16.900\n So it's essentially telling you\n\n1:03:16.900 --> 1:03:18.800\n that you should fold this hand\n\n1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:20.080\n that is much better than this.\n\n1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:23.160\n So it begs the question, why?\n\n1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:27.000\n Because what the solvers do is they use the information\n\n1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.400\n of your own cards to formulate all the possible hands\n\n1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:32.080\n your opponent can have.\n\n1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:34.160\n So if your opponent is,\n\n1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:36.640\n so basically if you had the king, queen,\n\n1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:41.640\n you know, it may say, for lack of a better nerdy term,\n\n1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:43.480\n it blocks potential bluffing hands\n\n1:03:43.480 --> 1:03:44.680\n that your opponent can have.\n\n1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:47.760\n So let's say if your opponent would bluff with queen, jack,\n\n1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:49.160\n but you have a queen.\n\n1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:51.320\n So there are less combinations of queen, jack.\n\n1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:54.200\n So it will find a better bluff catcher, if you will.\n\n1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.560\n So that's what's really not intuitive to poker players.\n\n1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:58.040\n Poker players usually think like,\n\n1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:00.820\n well, this, my hand is pretty good, so I got a call,\n\n1:04:00.820 --> 1:04:02.600\n but that's not how a solver would think.\n\n1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:06.920\n Solver uses, you know, common matrix and, you know.\n\n1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:10.620\n And sometimes it's tough to get the good why answers\n\n1:04:10.620 --> 1:04:13.320\n you just did for why a solver thinks something is better,\n\n1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:14.880\n or maybe in poker it's a little bit easier,\n\n1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:18.880\n but in the case of go and chess, it's not always obvious why,\n\n1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:20.560\n because it's not gonna explain stuff to you.\n\n1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:23.480\n I think one of the best ways to learn poker\n\n1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:25.120\n is when you see a solver output\n\n1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:28.280\n and it tells you one of these things, try to figure out why.\n\n1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:30.040\n Why does this solver do this?\n\n1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:32.440\n Why does it want you to call with this and fold this?\n\n1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:34.200\n And try to think about it on a deeper level.\n\n1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:36.860\n And you go, aha, probably because this card\n\n1:04:36.860 --> 1:04:39.720\n that I have here, you know, changes the range\n\n1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:42.600\n of my opponent's, you know, potential.\n\n1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:43.960\n I'd love to get your opinion\n\n1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:45.600\n on your relationship with solvers.\n\n1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:47.960\n Because for example, Magnus doesn't use them.\n\n1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:49.400\n His team uses them.\n\n1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:54.200\n Cause he feels like he's going to rely on it too much.\n\n1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:57.120\n And you can't use it when you're playing.\n\n1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:58.840\n What you really want is to build up\n\n1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:02.780\n an extremely strong intuition without the help of a solver.\n\n1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:04.920\n Is there some aspect of that that rings true to you?\n\n1:05:04.920 --> 1:05:05.740\n Absolutely.\n\n1:05:05.740 --> 1:05:07.080\n I totally can relate to what Magnus is saying.\n\n1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:08.640\n First and foremost, because when solvers\n\n1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:11.120\n was first introduced, I didn't come from that world.\n\n1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:13.640\n I was so intimidated because I didn't know how to use it.\n\n1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:15.400\n I don't know how to do an input.\n\n1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:17.560\n So I had two guys, one guy's a data scientist\n\n1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:20.000\n and, you know, another guy's like a poker savant,\n\n1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.520\n if you will, and they coached me and they did it.\n\n1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:25.720\n So today, if I was in a tough spot, you know,\n\n1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:27.120\n and I'm like, I don't know, what would a solver do?\n\n1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:30.980\n I will send them the hand and they'll run the solve for me.\n\n1:05:30.980 --> 1:05:33.360\n And then sort of give me the parameters of what to do.\n\n1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:34.920\n When I was playing, you know,\n\n1:05:34.920 --> 1:05:36.720\n regularly using solvers with them,\n\n1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.240\n we were spending six to eight hours a day\n\n1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:40.320\n going over all these solves.\n\n1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:42.760\n So intuitively I started to think and learn\n\n1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:44.100\n about what the solver would want,\n\n1:05:44.100 --> 1:05:46.080\n but I sort of understand where Magnus is coming from\n\n1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:48.320\n in that you don't want to become a slave to the sim,\n\n1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:49.760\n as I say, right?\n\n1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:51.680\n There's one kid I know, I joked with him,\n\n1:05:51.680 --> 1:05:53.160\n his name is Landon Tice.\n\n1:05:53.160 --> 1:05:56.200\n And, you know, he made a play that the sim, you know,\n\n1:05:56.200 --> 1:05:57.880\n would say, this is a good play.\n\n1:05:57.880 --> 1:06:00.080\n But I'm like, it's a good play, you know,\n\n1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:01.840\n in a simulated world against the robot.\n\n1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:05.120\n It's not in practice against the human, right?\n\n1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:06.660\n You don't need to be doing that.\n\n1:06:06.660 --> 1:06:08.760\n So if you become a slave to the sim\n\n1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:10.640\n and always do what the sim says,\n\n1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:13.080\n you're handcuffed to a certain degree.\n\n1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:16.040\n Is there some, at the highest level plays,\n\n1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:19.520\n there's still a role for feel and intuition?\n\n1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:20.360\n Absolutely.\n\n1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:21.200\n If you're not doing that,\n\n1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:22.760\n cause here's the thing, right?\n\n1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:25.600\n No human being plays perfectly balanced\n\n1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.640\n in game three optimal like a robot would.\n\n1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:29.200\n They're not, right?\n\n1:06:29.200 --> 1:06:31.000\n So there are opportunities there to take advantage\n\n1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:34.360\n of the things that they do that are slightly too aggressive\n\n1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:35.840\n or less aggressive.\n\n1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:37.200\n You know, for example,\n\n1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:41.120\n say most human beings don't bluff enough in a certain spot.\n\n1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:44.680\n So you don't have to call with the correct range of hands.\n\n1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:45.640\n You don't have to,\n\n1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:48.040\n because they're not bluffing at the optimal frequency.\n\n1:06:48.040 --> 1:06:50.520\n So you don't have to call at the optimal frequency.\n\n1:06:50.520 --> 1:06:53.880\n You'd be making this mistake, frankly, if you did.\n\n1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:58.520\n What's the difference between in person and online play,\n\n1:06:58.520 --> 1:06:59.560\n given that context?\n\n1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:02.040\n Yeah, well, online poker and live poker,\n\n1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:03.400\n it's the same game, right?\n\n1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:04.240\n Same, it's poker,\n\n1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:06.480\n but it's different in so many levels, right?\n\n1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:08.880\n I think playing online,\n\n1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:11.040\n you have to focus far more on fundamentals.\n\n1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:12.200\n You know, on game theory,\n\n1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:14.960\n you don't have the added bonus of looking across the table\n\n1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:17.040\n and getting any sense of whether your opponent\n\n1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:20.280\n is strong or weak, they're bluffing, whatever, you know.\n\n1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:24.680\n And also because online poker, those that play it,\n\n1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:26.720\n you play far more hands.\n\n1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.880\n Like some of these guys are playing 10, 20 tables\n\n1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:30.440\n at the same time, right?\n\n1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:32.400\n So you're just, you're hitting the long run really quickly\n\n1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:35.080\n and you're creating a database on your opponents, right?\n\n1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:37.520\n So let's say, you know, online, I can see your data.\n\n1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:40.480\n I'm like, well, this guy, he's playing 40% of hands.\n\n1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:43.240\n He's betting the river 80% of the time.\n\n1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:45.560\n So now I can use that data and, you know,\n\n1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:46.400\n exploit you that way.\n\n1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:49.000\n When you play live, you don't have that.\n\n1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.160\n Do you enjoy playing online?\n\n1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:54.400\n I enjoy, so with online poker, I enjoy the convenience of it\n\n1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:55.720\n because, you know, you can be on your couch\n\n1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:57.400\n in your underwear, not leave your house.\n\n1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:00.080\n Do you also play multiple games at the same time\n\n1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:01.520\n or do you try to play one game?\n\n1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:03.640\n I typically like to play one or two,\n\n1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:05.120\n but I can play up to four.\n\n1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:09.360\n I find that past four, it's hard for me to keep up\n\n1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:11.360\n and keep track of what's actually happening.\n\n1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:13.240\n You know, it's a different mindset required.\n\n1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:14.240\n Like a lot of these young guys,\n\n1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:16.720\n they're accustomed to 20 tables at a time.\n\n1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:20.680\n It feels like the purity of the game is gone.\n\n1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:22.000\n It's much more robotic, right?\n\n1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.800\n So if you're playing 20 tables,\n\n1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:27.040\n you're just making decisions based on like what, you know,\n\n1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:30.280\n you're not thinking about the depth of the situation\n\n1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:31.640\n and what just happened 15 minutes ago.\n\n1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:32.600\n You don't even know what happened\n\n1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:35.360\n because you can't pay attention to all that at once.\n\n1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:37.560\n And some of the magic of poker is the low sample.\n\n1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:38.400\n I agree.\n\n1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:41.240\n For example, and sorry to be bringing up Magnus so much,\n\n1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:42.960\n but there's so much parallel between the two of you\n\n1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:45.640\n and the poker and the chess world.\n\n1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:49.160\n He hates Olympics and world championships\n\n1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:51.760\n and all that kind of stuff because it's so low sample.\n\n1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:53.440\n But to me, that's part of the magic of it.\n\n1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:56.880\n There's the World Series of Poker, the main event.\n\n1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.440\n There's a magic to it.\n\n1:08:58.440 --> 1:08:59.320\n I agree, yeah.\n\n1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:00.920\n And I don't know what that is exactly\n\n1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:03.760\n because so much of the stake is so rare,\n\n1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:07.840\n so much drama and heartbreak leading up to it\n\n1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:12.160\n that all somehow, yeah, it accumulates\n\n1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:15.360\n to that magical moment when somebody wins.\n\n1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:16.400\n Especially that event,\n\n1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:18.280\n the World Series of Poker main event historically,\n\n1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:20.040\n like that's it, you know, that's the pinnacle.\n\n1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:21.520\n That's where like mainstream watches,\n\n1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:23.240\n that's where people are tuning in\n\n1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:25.440\n and the gravity of the moment, you know,\n\n1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:26.640\n it's so much bigger than people,\n\n1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.320\n like everyone gets the opportunity\n\n1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:30.400\n to play armchair quarterback too, right?\n\n1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:31.440\n Oh, he should do this.\n\n1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:32.520\n You're not there.\n\n1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:33.560\n You're not under the lights.\n\n1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:34.920\n You're not under the pressure.\n\n1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:37.400\n You know, it might seem easy for you at home to be like,\n\n1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:39.320\n well, yeah, but you can see the whole cards.\n\n1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:40.440\n You know, they can't.\n\n1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:44.160\n Certainly the idea of the small sample with tournaments,\n\n1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:49.160\n I like the idea that you don't have to worry about,\n\n1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:52.920\n oh, well, if I do this now, then in the future,\n\n1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:53.960\n you know, I won't be balanced.\n\n1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:55.640\n I have to be balanced here or anything like that.\n\n1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:57.960\n That's like really boring and lame, right?\n\n1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:00.720\n Again, that is kind of the way the younger generation\n\n1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:03.600\n learns how to play the game, being balanced in every spot\n\n1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:07.960\n and then randomizing, you know, like, oh,\n\n1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:09.240\n I'm supposed to do this 50% of the time.\n\n1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:12.360\n Okay, so if my left card is red, I'll do it.\n\n1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:13.240\n And if it's black, I don't.\n\n1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:14.400\n So you're not even making,\n\n1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:17.000\n you're no longer making actual decisions for yourself.\n\n1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.440\n You're just randomizing.\n\n1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:20.720\n And that's way less fun for me\n\n1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:23.200\n than tailoring it to the situation.\n\n1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:24.720\n And the final table at the main event,\n\n1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:25.560\n there's none of that.\n\n1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:28.240\n You have to, I mean, it's all or nothing.\n\n1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:30.520\n Well, you shouldn't be, but there are like, again,\n\n1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:31.560\n I think a lot of the young guys,\n\n1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:32.880\n they are thinking in that regard,\n\n1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:34.800\n like, oh, randomization.\n\n1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:38.000\n Maybe at that table, the final table at the main event,\n\n1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.720\n what's a hand that stands out to you\n\n1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:44.080\n that was especially gutsy and powerful or memorable\n\n1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:46.080\n for that you've seen in the history of poker?\n\n1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:47.520\n Well, for me, the one that stands out\n\n1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:49.600\n and probably because I was so young\n\n1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:51.800\n and it was my first year, like one of my wife,\n\n1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:53.240\n won a bracelet that year,\n\n1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:56.400\n was I was friends with Scotty Wynn, the Prince of Poker.\n\n1:10:56.400 --> 1:10:58.960\n And he was heads up against the guy named Kevin McBride.\n\n1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:00.880\n And I was on the rail, you know, I'm like, wow,\n\n1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:02.280\n he's gonna, you know, he's heads up.\n\n1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:03.480\n And he was so cool.\n\n1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:05.960\n Like he had a mullet, but it's perfect, right?\n\n1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:07.640\n He had the white shirt, the black thing.\n\n1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:10.520\n He's drinking a Michelob, smoking a cigarette, whatever,\n\n1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:12.120\n you know, all chill.\n\n1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:13.800\n He bets it all on the river.\n\n1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:17.760\n And the guy's thinking, and he psychologically owned him.\n\n1:11:17.760 --> 1:11:20.160\n And he said, he goes with his beer, he goes,\n\n1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.760\n you call gonna be all over baby.\n\n1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.560\n Ha ha ha, that's right.\n\n1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:27.120\n Okay, so this guy who was an amateur heard that\n\n1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:29.120\n and was like, there's so much pressure\n\n1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:30.240\n in this moment right now.\n\n1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:31.840\n I can't handle this pressure.\n\n1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:33.920\n But Scotty just told me, if I call here,\n\n1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:34.920\n the pressure's gone.\n\n1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.200\n I don't have to be under it anymore.\n\n1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:39.760\n So he sort of hypnotized them into making the call,\n\n1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:41.440\n you know, and Scotty had it.\n\n1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:43.240\n Scotty had, you know, the full house\n\n1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:44.200\n and it was over for the guy.\n\n1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:45.960\n You call gonna be all over baby.\n\n1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:47.880\n It was, I just, I love that aspect,\n\n1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:49.320\n sort of the table talk dynamic,\n\n1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:52.780\n which isn't as prevalent today as it was back then,\n\n1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:55.200\n but that one sticks out.\n\n1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:57.120\n And it probably, because it was one of my first.\n\n1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:02.120\n So the few words you say at the table can completely affect\n\n1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.120\n a hand like that.\n\n1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:07.660\n That's almost, that's scary.\n\n1:12:07.660 --> 1:12:09.720\n It was just so cool to me, you know,\n\n1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:11.900\n like just how he was so calm.\n\n1:12:11.900 --> 1:12:14.920\n And I think that too, added more pressure to the amateur.\n\n1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:17.540\n And I think like, again, part of it is,\n\n1:12:17.540 --> 1:12:19.400\n even back then it was 1998,\n\n1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.640\n there's still a big rail of people and there's lights\n\n1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:22.920\n and they're, you know, they're filming\n\n1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:23.760\n and all this kind of stuff.\n\n1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:25.280\n And it's a lot of pressure for a guy\n\n1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:26.560\n who's never been in this environment.\n\n1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:31.080\n And now I'm telling you, it can all be over soon.\n\n1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:33.560\n It will all be over soon.\n\n1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:35.700\n Just call, it's finished.\n\n1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:39.160\n Something about that accent too.\n\n1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:41.640\n Now you're a master at table talk as well.\n\n1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:45.240\n Do you have, do you just kind of go with your gut,\n\n1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:46.200\n you flow with it?\n\n1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.240\n Or is there a deliberate strategy with this sometimes?\n\n1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.760\n There's usually some sort of strategy that I think about\n\n1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:53.380\n in terms of what I want to say and whatnot.\n\n1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:56.520\n But a lot of the time I just go, I go with it, you know,\n\n1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:59.160\n the more you talk, the more information you get.\n\n1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:02.000\n Yeah, but in some cases against really good players,\n\n1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.280\n you're just giving away information, right?\n\n1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:05.600\n Like if I'm playing against Phil Ivey,\n\n1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:08.020\n I'm not engaging in anything.\n\n1:13:08.020 --> 1:13:08.960\n Cause he can read through it.\n\n1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.480\n He can sense based on what I'm saying, you know,\n\n1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:13.640\n the clues and where I'm trying to take him.\n\n1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:16.540\n And he reads through, he sees the tree through the forest\n\n1:13:16.540 --> 1:13:17.620\n or whatever you want to call it,\n\n1:13:17.620 --> 1:13:18.980\n the forest through the trees.\n\n1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:21.920\n And you know, so then I would just be like\n\n1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:24.480\n allowing myself to be exploitable.\n\n1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:26.640\n Is some of it just for fun?\n\n1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:29.400\n Because at the end of the day, if you're having fun,\n\n1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:31.280\n you might be at the top of your game.\n\n1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:33.320\n I've been thinking about this a lot lately actually.\n\n1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:34.500\n It's funny you bring this up\n\n1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:36.960\n because I've been thinking about when I'm at my best.\n\n1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:39.500\n And I think I'm at my best when I am comfortable like that.\n\n1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:40.340\n Right?\n\n1:13:40.340 --> 1:13:42.960\n Where I'm not so stiff and worried about, you know,\n\n1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:44.920\n checking properly and worried about reading people.\n\n1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:46.440\n I'm like, no, I'm me.\n\n1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:47.280\n All right, I'm going to play some poker.\n\n1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:48.120\n What do you want?\n\n1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:48.940\n Do you want to call me?\n\n1:13:48.940 --> 1:13:49.780\n Call, go ahead, do what you want.\n\n1:13:49.780 --> 1:13:50.600\n Right?\n\n1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:51.640\n Cause then I realized, you know, ultimately it was like,\n\n1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:53.080\n I'm comfortable in that.\n\n1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:54.600\n My opponents aren't as comfortable in that.\n\n1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:57.240\n They're comfortable with this, you know, the robot thing.\n\n1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:59.960\n But I thought more about that and how,\n\n1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:01.920\n especially with some tournaments coming up,\n\n1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:05.400\n I plan on really kind of sort of getting back to my roots\n\n1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:06.240\n in that regard.\n\n1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:08.480\n I love it.\n\n1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:10.040\n From a spectator perspective, I love it.\n\n1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:11.880\n But it's also interesting whenever you see a Daniel\n\n1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:13.000\n on the ground of quiet.\n\n1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:19.360\n That's an interesting, like it feels like a calm\n\n1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:20.880\n before a storm of sorts.\n\n1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:22.440\n So I'm sure that's also part of it.\n\n1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.160\n Yeah, like I've gone, I've ebbed and flowed.\n\n1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:25.960\n And like I said, you know, I took on some coaches\n\n1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:27.360\n and that was really learning game theory.\n\n1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:29.600\n Cause I felt like it was important to always stick,\n\n1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.160\n you know, keep up with what's going on.\n\n1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:33.480\n And then I do feel like to some degree,\n\n1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:36.360\n it sort of took away a little bit of my own\n\n1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:39.840\n instinctual ideas in terms of what I should be doing.\n\n1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:40.680\n Right?\n\n1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:43.840\n So I think like the most dangerous version of myself\n\n1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:46.820\n is a deep understanding of the game theory\n\n1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:50.040\n with my wisdom of many years of,\n\n1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:53.240\n and comfort of just sort of like being myself at the table.\n\n1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:54.440\n And being relaxed.\n\n1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:55.280\n Relaxed.\n\n1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:56.600\n Letting your mind flow.\n\n1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:59.280\n Let me ask you the greatest, the goat question,\n\n1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:00.280\n greatest of all time.\n\n1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:03.320\n Can you make the case for a few folks?\n\n1:15:03.320 --> 1:15:07.480\n So first you tweeted referring to Phil Ivey as the goat,\n\n1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:09.320\n saying the goat doing goat things.\n\n1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:10.720\n That's a recent tweet.\n\n1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:14.240\n So can you make the case for Phil Ivey,\n\n1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:17.560\n or maybe who is the greatest poker player of all time?\n\n1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:19.040\n Would you put Phil?\n\n1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:21.880\n For me, until someone knocks him off the podium,\n\n1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:24.680\n the king of poker and the goat is Phil Ivey.\n\n1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:25.520\n Okay?\n\n1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:26.340\n So, and the reason I say that is,\n\n1:15:26.340 --> 1:15:28.240\n I think of poker as more than just one game.\n\n1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:29.080\n Right?\n\n1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:29.920\n There's different variants.\n\n1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:32.480\n You know, there's Holdem, Omaha, Stud, Triple Draw,\n\n1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:33.960\n all these different types of games.\n\n1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:37.920\n And Phil in every arena has been dominant.\n\n1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:40.560\n Whether it was tournament poker, dominated it.\n\n1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:43.680\n Mixed game, high stakes poker in Bobby's room, dominated.\n\n1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:46.900\n Online poker against all the wizards, dominated.\n\n1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:48.600\n Made millions in every arena.\n\n1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:51.200\n And, you know, he sort of took a few years away from poker\n\n1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:52.720\n with his legal troubles and things like that,\n\n1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:53.680\n but he's back.\n\n1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:56.280\n You know, he's been playing in the high roller series again.\n\n1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:58.160\n And, you know, he comes from,\n\n1:15:58.160 --> 1:15:59.860\n he's cut from a different cloth,\n\n1:15:59.860 --> 1:16:03.700\n but he has a tenacity and a focus that's unparalleled,\n\n1:16:03.700 --> 1:16:04.540\n I think.\n\n1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:06.480\n When he's in the zone, I mean, for lack,\n\n1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:08.080\n and this has nothing to do with race.\n\n1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:09.560\n It really has to do with mannerism,\n\n1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:12.320\n but he does remind me of like a combination\n\n1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:14.000\n of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods\n\n1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.080\n in the way that he approaches it.\n\n1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:16.720\n He's very intense.\n\n1:16:16.720 --> 1:16:19.040\n And he outworks everybody, you know?\n\n1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:20.400\n And I think, frankly,\n\n1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:22.580\n a lot of his mannerisms do come from them\n\n1:16:22.580 --> 1:16:25.000\n because he's young watching these guys on TV.\n\n1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.280\n And a lot of his ways of being, you know,\n\n1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:29.400\n his learned behavior, I think probably from people like that.\n\n1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:31.320\n People at the top of their sport\n\n1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:34.400\n and people that are Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan\n\n1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:35.720\n aren't just at the top of their sport,\n\n1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:37.160\n but they kind of dominate the sport\n\n1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:38.440\n to some kind of aura that.\n\n1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:39.720\n There's a uniqueness to them.\n\n1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:41.440\n They're not built like us.\n\n1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:42.760\n They're not, you know, they're not.\n\n1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:45.200\n Like I wish, I wish I could have the kind of focus\n\n1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:47.120\n that Phil Ivey has, you know, and see everything\n\n1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:47.960\n that he's saying.\n\n1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:49.520\n I just, that's not me, you know?\n\n1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:50.400\n I don't have that.\n\n1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:53.400\n And he does, he has that gene, whatever it is.\n\n1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:55.700\n But they also look like they're not having that much fun.\n\n1:16:55.700 --> 1:16:58.180\n They're more focused on the perfection,\n\n1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:00.080\n like a dogged pursuit of perfection.\n\n1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.880\n And you know, that might even be true.\n\n1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:03.080\n It might not be as fun.\n\n1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:03.920\n You know, I don't know.\n\n1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:05.080\n Like I have fun at the table.\n\n1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:07.200\n When you look outwardly, you look at someone,\n\n1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:08.560\n like maybe he is having a blast.\n\n1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:11.080\n Maybe that's just the way that he likes, you know?\n\n1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:13.880\n Like is Tiger Woods having fun when he's like on 17\n\n1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:14.720\n about to win a major?\n\n1:17:14.720 --> 1:17:16.920\n It doesn't look like it, theoretically.\n\n1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:19.240\n Well, if you look at Michael Jordan,\n\n1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:20.320\n I don't know about Tiger Woods,\n\n1:17:20.320 --> 1:17:22.760\n but I think they're more focused\n\n1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:25.000\n on every single mistake they make.\n\n1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.920\n I think they're more obsessed about not making a mistake\n\n1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:30.480\n and hating every time they make a mistake.\n\n1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:34.760\n That's probably like 99% of their mental energy.\n\n1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:37.400\n I think that's part of what makes them great, right?\n\n1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:39.160\n They don't look past the mistake and just let it,\n\n1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:40.000\n it's whatever.\n\n1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.800\n They're like, they want to correct it.\n\n1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:44.540\n And yeah, there's a tension, almost like a trade off.\n\n1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:45.840\n I wonder if that's always the case\n\n1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:49.200\n between sort of greatness and happiness.\n\n1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:51.680\n I remember Huck Seed, who, you know,\n\n1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:53.960\n when I was a kid growing up, he was like the poker idol.\n\n1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:55.920\n He won the world championship in 1996.\n\n1:17:55.920 --> 1:17:57.960\n And I was lucky enough to hang out with him a little bit.\n\n1:17:57.960 --> 1:17:59.160\n And he would go through these streaks\n\n1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:02.480\n where he had an A game and he had an F game.\n\n1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:03.720\n His A game was unparalleled.\n\n1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:05.080\n Nobody could beat him, right?\n\n1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:09.040\n But his F game was so terrible that he was just a fish.\n\n1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:10.240\n You know, he was playing terribly.\n\n1:18:10.240 --> 1:18:11.280\n And I remember him saying,\n\n1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:13.320\n and it was exactly what you're saying.\n\n1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:16.240\n He'd make like one little mistake, right?\n\n1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:17.720\n And then he would go off.\n\n1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:19.320\n And I was like, Huck, why do you do that?\n\n1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:20.720\n Like, you know, your B game would be just fine.\n\n1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:21.880\n He's like, well, if I'm gonna make a mistake,\n\n1:18:21.880 --> 1:18:22.720\n what's the point?\n\n1:18:23.580 --> 1:18:25.000\n What's the point, right?\n\n1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:26.000\n I'm trying.\n\n1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:27.320\n Like, if you can't play perfect,\n\n1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:28.840\n there's no point in playing at all.\n\n1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:30.720\n So he was extreme in that regard,\n\n1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:32.040\n in the way that he viewed it.\n\n1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:33.760\n And depending on the sport,\n\n1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:36.400\n those folks, like in chess, certainly the case,\n\n1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:38.520\n that kind of mindset can destroy you.\n\n1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:39.360\n Absolutely.\n\n1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:40.200\n No, I totally see that.\n\n1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.760\n Because of a sequence of mistakes.\n\n1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:44.680\n Like the kind of year you had\n\n1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:45.760\n with the well scissor poker\n\n1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:48.400\n can completely destroy a human being.\n\n1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:51.080\n If you're not able to see the bigger picture of it.\n\n1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:52.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:55.280\n You said that Phil Ivey is the hardest,\n\n1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:56.360\n your toughest opponent,\n\n1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:57.800\n the toughest person to play against.\n\n1:18:57.800 --> 1:18:59.000\n Why is that?\n\n1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:00.720\n And how do you beat him?\n\n1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:02.240\n Because Phil Ivey's just,\n\n1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:04.840\n he's seeing things that nobody else has seen really.\n\n1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:06.780\n Like subtle things, where I'm putting my hands,\n\n1:19:06.780 --> 1:19:08.760\n where I'm looking, you know, my pulse,\n\n1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:10.680\n like stuff that I don't even know I'm giving off.\n\n1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:13.000\n He's so engaged and so focused\n\n1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:17.600\n and has such a, just a, he's fearless, right?\n\n1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:18.560\n A lot of people, you know,\n\n1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:19.400\n they'll play poker and be like,\n\n1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:20.220\n you know what?\n\n1:19:20.220 --> 1:19:21.060\n I don't think this guy has it.\n\n1:19:21.060 --> 1:19:22.480\n But do they have the guts?\n\n1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:24.360\n Do they have the cojones, if you will,\n\n1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:26.320\n to actually do anything about it?\n\n1:19:26.320 --> 1:19:27.160\n Right?\n\n1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:27.980\n And stand up to this person?\n\n1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:28.820\n He does.\n\n1:19:28.820 --> 1:19:29.660\n You know?\n\n1:19:29.660 --> 1:19:30.840\n I forgot the hand that you tweeted\n\n1:19:30.840 --> 1:19:33.200\n about the goat doing goat things.\n\n1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:34.960\n That wasn't even that big of a goat hand.\n\n1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:37.280\n But like, there's hands where like,\n\n1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:39.980\n there was a famous one in Australia\n\n1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:43.240\n where the flop was like jack, jack at nine\n\n1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:46.640\n and Phil check raised the flop with six, seven, nothing.\n\n1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:47.840\n Just absolutely nothing.\n\n1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:50.440\n And the guy re raised him, right?\n\n1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.080\n And Phil just knew.\n\n1:19:52.080 --> 1:19:53.800\n He went all in with nothing.\n\n1:19:53.800 --> 1:19:55.600\n If the guy calls, he's done, he's cooked.\n\n1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:59.240\n But he was so tuned in that this guy's not strong,\n\n1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:01.220\n that he just, you know, he did things like that.\n\n1:20:01.220 --> 1:20:03.400\n And it's tough to play against a guy like that.\n\n1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:07.680\n So he gets great reads and is able to execute on them,\n\n1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:09.960\n has the guts to execute on them.\n\n1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:12.640\n He's got experience, he's got work ethic.\n\n1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:16.180\n He also, I think one thing I'm underselling too,\n\n1:20:16.180 --> 1:20:18.240\n is his strategic mind, right?\n\n1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:21.800\n Like I believe that, you know, like I said,\n\n1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:23.460\n the new age player, they learn how to play\n\n1:20:23.460 --> 1:20:25.240\n through a very systematic approach.\n\n1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:27.040\n Okay, let's look at the data.\n\n1:20:27.040 --> 1:20:29.080\n Make up a game right now.\n\n1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:31.100\n Three cards, we each get three cards.\n\n1:20:31.100 --> 1:20:34.040\n Jacks are wild, sixes are, you know,\n\n1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:35.600\n six of hearts is wild, right?\n\n1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:36.840\n Just make up that game.\n\n1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:39.320\n Phil will figure it out intuitively,\n\n1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:41.100\n very, very quickly, right?\n\n1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:43.760\n Without having the answers for him, right?\n\n1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:45.000\n So that's like the difference\n\n1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.740\n between the players of my generation.\n\n1:20:46.740 --> 1:20:48.880\n We had to figure this stuff out on our own.\n\n1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:50.880\n Today, well, I wanna know the answer,\n\n1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:53.240\n I go ask the computer and the computer tells me.\n\n1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:55.720\n So I really believe like if you created a game from scratch\n\n1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:59.140\n that Phil Ivey would be my horse that I wanna play in it.\n\n1:20:59.140 --> 1:21:03.520\n So he's in some sense in tune with some deeper thing.\n\n1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:06.200\n He has what we used to call card sense.\n\n1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:07.720\n Card sense.\n\n1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:09.880\n Can you try to make the case for some others\n\n1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:13.960\n like Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, Daniel Negrano,\n\n1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:15.760\n and maybe one of the modern guys\n\n1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:17.240\n like Justin Bonomo or somebody like that?\n\n1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:20.000\n Sure, oh, so let's start with Doyle, okay?\n\n1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.040\n Like what Doyle has going for him above all,\n\n1:21:22.040 --> 1:21:24.240\n above and beyond is twofold, really.\n\n1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:26.760\n Longevity, I mean, he's in his late 80s.\n\n1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:29.240\n And last time I played with him, I was like,\n\n1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:30.480\n how is he getting better?\n\n1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:32.080\n Like I really felt like he was playing better\n\n1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:34.640\n than he had, you know, in the previous years.\n\n1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:38.040\n But also with Doyle, like Doyle had to figure,\n\n1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:39.880\n you know, we talked about my generation\n\n1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:40.920\n having to figure it on their own.\n\n1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:43.040\n I mean, they really had to figure it out on their own.\n\n1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:45.200\n Like they didn't have any computer simulation\n\n1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:47.720\n to tell you if Ace King was a favorite over pocket sixes.\n\n1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:48.560\n They didn't.\n\n1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:49.380\n So we know what he did.\n\n1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:51.640\n He would take a deck of cards and they would deal out,\n\n1:21:51.640 --> 1:21:53.060\n and they were with a notepad, right?\n\n1:21:53.060 --> 1:21:54.360\n Okay, Ace King won.\n\n1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:55.640\n And then they would do like a hundred of them\n\n1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:57.680\n and be like, all right, Ace King won like 53.\n\n1:21:57.680 --> 1:21:58.720\n So it must be a favorite.\n\n1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:00.720\n And he did it manually, you know?\n\n1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:03.200\n And he did it in a time when it was very, very difficult.\n\n1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:06.140\n And he's seen poker evolve and change throughout the years.\n\n1:22:06.140 --> 1:22:08.240\n Now, listen, is he gonna be able to compete\n\n1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:09.400\n against the top players in the world today?\n\n1:22:09.400 --> 1:22:10.960\n Absolutely not, you know?\n\n1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:14.680\n But how many people, he's the best 88 year old player\n\n1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:16.400\n in the world by a mile, okay?\n\n1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:17.640\n That's not even close.\n\n1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:20.120\n And Doyle, again, he's another guy who plays all the games.\n\n1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:22.840\n He's played high stakes cash, tournaments, you name it.\n\n1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:24.520\n He's iconic, you know, he's the godfather.\n\n1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:26.440\n So, but there's also an element to that.\n\n1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:30.500\n So the iconic element, like your personality in poker.\n\n1:22:30.500 --> 1:22:33.360\n I mean, not to romanticize this thing too much,\n\n1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:38.220\n but poker is also a game of personalities.\n\n1:22:38.220 --> 1:22:39.920\n I mean, it's part of the greatness\n\n1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.040\n is like the uniqueness of the human being.\n\n1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:44.200\n Yeah, I think also, yeah.\n\n1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:46.080\n I mean, if you'd like looking at it from that perspective\n\n1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:47.320\n in terms of like Goat,\n\n1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:49.320\n like Goat in terms of what you represent,\n\n1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:51.400\n like the cowboy, the godfather, you know,\n\n1:22:51.400 --> 1:22:52.320\n he's been around, you know,\n\n1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:54.560\n we played in the sixties and stuff like that.\n\n1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:56.400\n It's just something like incredibly cool.\n\n1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:59.360\n Like I often think about if I could go back in time\n\n1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:01.280\n and like visit, you know, an era,\n\n1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:04.200\n I'd love to go like to Vegas in the seventies\n\n1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:05.280\n and just like, I'm proud.\n\n1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:07.080\n I already, like, I can think of what it would smell like,\n\n1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:09.240\n probably not ideal, cigarettes and, you know,\n\n1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:11.300\n the leather jackets and just the vibe\n\n1:23:11.300 --> 1:23:13.200\n of what it must've been like with the mobsters\n\n1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:14.040\n and things like that.\n\n1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:15.160\n You know, he's lived through all that,\n\n1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:16.380\n all the cool movies we've seen.\n\n1:23:16.380 --> 1:23:18.600\n Like Doyle talks about some of those films.\n\n1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:20.200\n He's like, yeah, that guy,\n\n1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:22.120\n he said he was gonna stab me in my stomach.\n\n1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:23.880\n You know, he knows these people.\n\n1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:27.280\n It was, he's like a source of history, really.\n\n1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:31.720\n Yeah, when poker was a game for the mob\n\n1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:34.480\n and the degenerates and all that kind of stuff\n\n1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:37.380\n before it transitioned into professional sport.\n\n1:23:37.380 --> 1:23:38.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:39.060\n Professional game.\n\n1:23:39.060 --> 1:23:40.680\n Yeah, so he was there through the whole thing.\n\n1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:42.840\n He's been there through the whole transition.\n\n1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:43.760\n He's seen it all, yeah.\n\n1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:45.120\n Yeah, and then to the online world.\n\n1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:46.800\n So what about,\n\n1:23:49.920 --> 1:23:51.760\n I can't even say without smiling, Phil Hellmuth.\n\n1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:53.720\n Okay, so Phil, here's the thing with Phil.\n\n1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:56.480\n He takes it very personal when I say this\n\n1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:58.040\n and he doesn't hear the compliment.\n\n1:23:58.040 --> 1:23:59.560\n He only hears the negativity.\n\n1:23:59.560 --> 1:24:00.720\n Because Phil wants to be considered\n\n1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:01.560\n the greatest of all time.\n\n1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:02.520\n Hashtag positive.\n\n1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.360\n He wants to be the greatest of all time.\n\n1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:07.040\n But I'm like, Phil, here's the facts.\n\n1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:10.120\n You have the best, absolute greatest resume\n\n1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:12.320\n at the World Series of Poker of anyone in the world.\n\n1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:13.960\n Is that not enough, right?\n\n1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:14.860\n That's what you have.\n\n1:24:14.860 --> 1:24:16.200\n You have that, right?\n\n1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:17.680\n Now, do I think you're the best\n\n1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:19.320\n no limit holding player in the world today?\n\n1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:20.160\n No.\n\n1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:21.240\n Do I think that, you know,\n\n1:24:21.240 --> 1:24:22.800\n you can play high stakes mixed games\n\n1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:24.400\n with the best players in the world today and win?\n\n1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:25.320\n No, right?\n\n1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:28.360\n So he wouldn't get as much flack on this topic\n\n1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:31.480\n if he wasn't so boastful and like, you know, demanding.\n\n1:24:31.480 --> 1:24:32.700\n Like you never hear Phil Ivey say,\n\n1:24:32.700 --> 1:24:33.920\n I'm the best in the world.\n\n1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:35.740\n Like his peers do, right?\n\n1:24:35.740 --> 1:24:37.140\n But Phil wants to make the claim.\n\n1:24:37.140 --> 1:24:40.760\n And I simply say, I beg to differ, right?\n\n1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:41.680\n I beg to differ.\n\n1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:45.480\n Like, I don't think you are the best player in the world.\n\n1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:48.320\n If we can linger on the compliment so he can hear it,\n\n1:24:49.220 --> 1:24:50.440\n what makes him so good?\n\n1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:52.800\n Because it seems like a lot of times\n\n1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:54.680\n his play is not optimal.\n\n1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:57.880\n Yeah, he definitely has his own brand and style of play,\n\n1:24:57.880 --> 1:24:58.720\n right?\n\n1:24:58.720 --> 1:24:59.540\n He does not adhere to,\n\n1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:00.760\n he's never used a solver in his life.\n\n1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:03.160\n He doesn't know, he's not in that world, right?\n\n1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:05.520\n Phil has a lot of faith and a lot of confidence\n\n1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:07.520\n in what he does and that it will be successful.\n\n1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:09.840\n And I think there's something to be said about that, right?\n\n1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:13.640\n He doesn't ever lack in belief that he can win\n\n1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:15.880\n and he finds a way to do it his way.\n\n1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:18.120\n And frankly, a lot of what he does\n\n1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:21.600\n is very effective against specific types of players\n\n1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:23.680\n who are intimidated by him,\n\n1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:25.560\n but whether it's his resume or his demeanor\n\n1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:27.280\n or his attitude sometimes, right?\n\n1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:28.720\n Like if you're an average player\n\n1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:31.800\n and then you beat Phil in a hand, you're gonna hear it.\n\n1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:34.960\n This idiot from Northern Europe and beat me in this pot.\n\n1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:37.160\n And for some people, they don't like that.\n\n1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:39.800\n So he can use that against them.\n\n1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:44.800\n But I also think too, like he cares so much, right?\n\n1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.440\n And that leads to trying really, really hard.\n\n1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:50.880\n Like he sees these moments and he doesn't phone them in.\n\n1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:53.440\n Like whatever brand of poker he plays,\n\n1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:57.280\n he tries his best at all times to succeed and to win.\n\n1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:00.080\n And there's some, even though like he's fundamentally flawed\n\n1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:01.040\n in a lot of things that he does\n\n1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:02.840\n compared to some of the bigger players,\n\n1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:05.160\n his effort and will and like his determination\n\n1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:08.480\n to stick around is, you know, is up there.\n\n1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:12.240\n And he is somebody who seems to really hate losing.\n\n1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:17.240\n Yes, yeah, he feels like he deserves to win, right?\n\n1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:18.680\n In all cases.\n\n1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:22.000\n And if he loses, it's, you know, it's not just.\n\n1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.840\n As you joked around that you and him\n\n1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:26.040\n might do an anger management course.\n\n1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:30.680\n Yeah, I did say that in one video.\n\n1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:33.640\n Now this is tough because you're a humble guy,\n\n1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:35.400\n but objectively speaking,\n\n1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:37.880\n can you say what your strengths are?\n\n1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:39.760\n You're often listed as one of,\n\n1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:41.360\n if not the greatest player of all time.\n\n1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:44.080\n So what are the things that make you stand out?\n\n1:26:44.080 --> 1:26:46.320\n So for me, when I grew up,\n\n1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:48.240\n I admired the big cash game players,\n\n1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:49.080\n because that's what I was.\n\n1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:51.280\n I love tournaments, but I wanted to be well rounded.\n\n1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:53.760\n Like in my day, you couldn't make the poker hall of fame\n\n1:26:53.760 --> 1:26:55.240\n if you just played one game.\n\n1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:57.720\n You had to jump in to the high stakes games\n\n1:26:57.720 --> 1:26:59.800\n in Bobby's room, as they say, right?\n\n1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:00.880\n And I was able to do that.\n\n1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:03.600\n When I was in my early, in my mid twenties,\n\n1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:06.000\n I was playing 4,000, 8,000 limits.\n\n1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.080\n You know, you could win or lose a million dollars in a day.\n\n1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:09.200\n So I grinded it out.\n\n1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:11.160\n Like a lot of people think, oh, you know, he's lucky.\n\n1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:12.520\n He's had sponsorship.\n\n1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:13.360\n Otherwise he'd be broke.\n\n1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:16.440\n It's like, I built multi million dollar bankrolls\n\n1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:18.000\n before any of that stuff existed.\n\n1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.160\n And I did it the good old fashioned way\n\n1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:21.720\n by sitting my butt on the table.\n\n1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.040\n I think probably one of my biggest strengths\n\n1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:25.600\n is self awareness.\n\n1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:29.080\n And in that regard, a level of humility\n\n1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:31.960\n that always allows me to say, okay, well, you know what?\n\n1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:34.440\n In this case with these players, they're better than me.\n\n1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:36.200\n So what am I going to learn from them, right?\n\n1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:38.040\n Rather than have this need to say,\n\n1:27:38.040 --> 1:27:40.040\n I'm the best because of history.\n\n1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:41.520\n I'm always looking to guys and go, wow,\n\n1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:42.440\n he does this really well.\n\n1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:45.600\n Whether it's the Adamos or the Ivies or whoever it may be.\n\n1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:49.000\n So my willingness to adapt, I think,\n\n1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:53.320\n and stay relevant by learning what the young guys are learning\n\n1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:54.760\n is something I've always done.\n\n1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:58.160\n And I also pride myself on, again, being well rounded,\n\n1:27:58.160 --> 1:27:59.240\n like playing all the games.\n\n1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:02.560\n Like I don't feel intimidated in any game,\n\n1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:04.440\n you know, whatever the format is.\n\n1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:06.960\n So always being a scholar of the game\n\n1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:09.720\n as the game evolves, as the different games evolve,\n\n1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:12.160\n the different players evolve, the culture evolves,\n\n1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.920\n always adjusting by being a scholar,\n\n1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:14.760\n having the humility to be a scholar.\n\n1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:18.000\n A healthy respect for, a healthy respect\n\n1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.120\n for the younger generation, how they learn,\n\n1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:22.320\n what they learn and what they can teach me,\n\n1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:25.600\n rather than poo poo it and say, oh, these kids today.\n\n1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:26.760\n Cause that's what a lot of people,\n\n1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:29.560\n like the Mike Matisos and the Phil Hellmuth, my generation,\n\n1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:32.040\n they just poo poo it because they don't understand it.\n\n1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:33.680\n On a level of one to 10,\n\n1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:36.720\n their level of understanding of this is like a one, maybe.\n\n1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:38.560\n If I'm being generous by calling it a one,\n\n1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:39.840\n they really don't understand it.\n\n1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:41.760\n So they poo poo it, right?\n\n1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:42.720\n It's easy to do that.\n\n1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:44.040\n Like, oh, that's not how I do it.\n\n1:28:44.040 --> 1:28:46.560\n So that's wrong or that's stupid or whatever.\n\n1:28:46.560 --> 1:28:47.560\n I don't take that approach.\n\n1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:48.640\n I go, well, let me learn.\n\n1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:50.480\n Let me see what there is to this.\n\n1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.080\n But that said, the crankiness that Matisos\n\n1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:55.160\n and Phil Hellmuth have is great to watch,\n\n1:28:55.160 --> 1:28:57.440\n especially when they're on a table with you.\n\n1:28:57.440 --> 1:28:58.280\n Oh, I love it.\n\n1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:00.480\n Yeah, it's a blast.\n\n1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:03.560\n You're masterful at being able to get under their skin.\n\n1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:06.280\n What about somebody from the new school,\n\n1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:11.280\n like Justin Bonomo, who's leading in terms of cash wins.\n\n1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:12.880\n Is there somebody like that,\n\n1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:17.520\n that stands out to you as a potential GOAT status person?\n\n1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:20.520\n Yeah, so there's two different ones, but one is very...\n\n1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:23.080\n So they're both just no limit, right?\n\n1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:24.920\n So again, when I think of poker,\n\n1:29:24.920 --> 1:29:26.920\n I think of a variety of games,\n\n1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:29.200\n but there's so many of the young guys that specialize.\n\n1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:31.240\n Michael Adamo is one that I've mentioned several times\n\n1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:32.680\n and I love the way that he approaches the game.\n\n1:29:32.680 --> 1:29:34.160\n Another one that's highly respected\n\n1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:37.040\n because of his online prowess and his...\n\n1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:39.480\n People have looked and how close he is to game theory\n\n1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:41.280\n and they say he's about as perfect as you get.\n\n1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:43.200\n And I got a kid named Linus.\n\n1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:46.360\n Linus love online, Linus Linger.\n\n1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:50.400\n So he just came second recently, I believe in the Triton,\n\n1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:51.240\n huge Triton event.\n\n1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:52.600\n So he's primarily an online player.\n\n1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:54.360\n Yeah, he's an online cash player for the most part,\n\n1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:55.360\n but he plays some live.\n\n1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:58.760\n And he's, again, and I respect the peers that I play with\n\n1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:00.680\n who say, yeah, he's tough as nails.\n\n1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:05.680\n There's another kid too, Russian kid named Timofey Kuznetsov\n\n1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:08.840\n and he plays all the games and he's well respected\n\n1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:10.840\n in that regard.\n\n1:30:10.840 --> 1:30:12.880\n And same with a guy like a Jungleman, Dan Cates,\n\n1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.320\n who's a unique personality.\n\n1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:17.400\n I mean, this guy showed up, won the poker players championship\n\n1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:20.800\n back to back years in a Randy Macho Man Savage costume.\n\n1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:23.200\n And he was doing Macho Man the entire time.\n\n1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.480\n Oh yeah, I'm gonna take all the chips like I did last year.\n\n1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:28.320\n Bust them all.\n\n1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:30.480\n And he was in character for the entirety of the tournament.\n\n1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:31.320\n This is great.\n\n1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:32.160\n Just unique.\n\n1:30:32.160 --> 1:30:35.040\n But yeah, I respect for a lot of those guys.\n\n1:30:35.040 --> 1:30:36.920\n Is it gonna take time to figure out\n\n1:30:36.920 --> 1:30:40.160\n who stands the test of time?\n\n1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:41.440\n That's the thing, right?\n\n1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:42.520\n So a lot of these kids,\n\n1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:44.920\n like there was a guy who beat me heads up\n\n1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:46.560\n in the million dollar one drop.\n\n1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:49.840\n I got 8.7, he won $15 million, kid named Dan Coleman.\n\n1:30:49.840 --> 1:30:53.400\n He was seen as like the next big thing in poker, right?\n\n1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:56.160\n He made his money, just wasn't for him.\n\n1:30:56.160 --> 1:30:58.160\n So he's moved on to doing what he's doing,\n\n1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:00.040\n skiing in the Alps, whatever.\n\n1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:02.320\n We have nobody seen him from like five, six years.\n\n1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:04.640\n So that can happen, right?\n\n1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:06.000\n Because there is a lot of burnout.\n\n1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:09.200\n I think it was actually a Gotham Chess\n\n1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:12.280\n who mentioned something about how difficult it is to like,\n\n1:31:12.280 --> 1:31:13.120\n I think it's true in poker.\n\n1:31:13.120 --> 1:31:15.080\n When you get really, really good at something,\n\n1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:18.920\n to get this much better takes so much work.\n\n1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:21.360\n And a lot of people don't necessarily wanna put in\n\n1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:23.440\n that kind of work in order to do that.\n\n1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:25.560\n That's just even staying at the same level\n\n1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:27.160\n takes a huge amount of work.\n\n1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:28.520\n Like, so if you wanna get better at chess,\n\n1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:29.600\n you're already like really, really good.\n\n1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:31.560\n And you're trying to get like one little bit better.\n\n1:31:31.560 --> 1:31:34.800\n You have to study like in a ridiculous amount, you know?\n\n1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:37.040\n And again, that's once you've already had,\n\n1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:38.480\n I think the toughest thing for anybody,\n\n1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:40.080\n once you've tasted success\n\n1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:41.800\n and you've already achieved it,\n\n1:31:41.800 --> 1:31:43.800\n staying hungry, staying on the top,\n\n1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:47.680\n reaching the top is much easier than it is to stay there.\n\n1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:49.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:53.320\n Over years, what's your training regimen in poker\n\n1:31:53.320 --> 1:31:58.320\n in terms of how you keep improving?\n\n1:31:58.360 --> 1:31:59.760\n So you said you study games,\n\n1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:03.600\n but that's mostly leading up to a particular tournament.\n\n1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:07.800\n But is there kind of a behind the scenes daily activity\n\n1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:11.560\n you try to do that kind of over time keeps you sharp?\n\n1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:12.960\n So for me, now that I'm 47,\n\n1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:17.320\n and I feel like the predominant aspect of my poker game\n\n1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:19.200\n is going to be in terms of my success\n\n1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:21.560\n is gonna be my mental state, right?\n\n1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:23.840\n So I find it's really, really important for me now\n\n1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:26.680\n at this age to have balance.\n\n1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:29.640\n So when I'm not playing poker and I'm out of it,\n\n1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:32.320\n poker is not even on my radar.\n\n1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:34.320\n You're able to remove it from your mind.\n\n1:32:34.320 --> 1:32:37.160\n Doing my fantasy hockey, play a little chess,\n\n1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:40.000\n you know, play some golf, watch some hockey,\n\n1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:41.400\n whatever the case may be,\n\n1:32:41.400 --> 1:32:42.680\n outside of the game.\n\n1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:43.800\n And then I start to get the itch.\n\n1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:45.680\n Like after the World Series of Poker,\n\n1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:47.960\n the poker door was closed.\n\n1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:49.240\n Yeah, you took some time off.\n\n1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:51.400\n All of August, I didn't play any poker at all\n\n1:32:51.400 --> 1:32:53.040\n until just recently, you know.\n\n1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:54.440\n I started to get the itch again.\n\n1:32:54.440 --> 1:32:55.800\n Because that's what's important for me,\n\n1:32:55.800 --> 1:32:58.200\n is if I don't have the itch and I don't want to play poker,\n\n1:32:58.200 --> 1:32:59.680\n then I'm not gonna be at my best.\n\n1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:01.400\n Once I start getting the itch,\n\n1:33:01.400 --> 1:33:02.480\n that's when I start to say,\n\n1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:04.600\n okay, let's start watching some of these streams.\n\n1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:06.800\n Let's see what my opponents are up to lately.\n\n1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:09.280\n And, you know, let's look at some solvers\n\n1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:10.920\n and different things like that.\n\n1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:12.360\n And you're doing pretty good.\n\n1:33:12.360 --> 1:33:14.320\n You came back and doing pretty good.\n\n1:33:15.360 --> 1:33:16.200\n Yeah, so far.\n\n1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:18.560\n Do you like being in front of the camera\n\n1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:21.600\n through the hell of the World Series of Poker this year?\n\n1:33:21.600 --> 1:33:23.160\n You filmed every single day.\n\n1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:24.280\n You did a vlog.\n\n1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:25.360\n Does that energize you?\n\n1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:26.200\n Is that exhausting?\n\n1:33:26.200 --> 1:33:28.360\n Because it's really beneficial to a huge amount of people.\n\n1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:30.520\n It energizes the poker community.\n\n1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:32.160\n But do you see it as a service\n\n1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:34.640\n or do you purely just love it?\n\n1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:37.280\n I've been comfortable on camera since I was a kid.\n\n1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.120\n When I was a kid, I wanted to be an actor.\n\n1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:40.360\n Like really, really young.\n\n1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:42.960\n And I was always comfortable in that environment.\n\n1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:45.720\n I think like that gives me a little bit of an advantage\n\n1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:47.880\n sometimes too, with these film events.\n\n1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:49.240\n Cause I'm comfortable with the mic on\n\n1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:50.840\n and on camera with the lights.\n\n1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:52.400\n And I think a lot of people maybe aren't\n\n1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:53.880\n with the knowledge that other people\n\n1:33:53.880 --> 1:33:55.400\n are gonna see what they're doing every day.\n\n1:33:55.400 --> 1:33:57.080\n So it's been so comfortable and easy for me.\n\n1:33:57.080 --> 1:33:58.680\n As far as the World Series goes\n\n1:33:58.680 --> 1:34:00.680\n and the vlogs and all the shooting,\n\n1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:02.240\n it's kind of therapeutic for me.\n\n1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.520\n It is essentially my version of journaling, right?\n\n1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:08.040\n So there's a lot of value, I think,\n\n1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:10.120\n in like at the end of a day doing a brain dump\n\n1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:11.880\n where you just write out and journal.\n\n1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:15.480\n But doing it on camera has this similar effect.\n\n1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:19.600\n And it also, when you make a mistake on your own,\n\n1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:20.840\n you're held accountable to you.\n\n1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:23.280\n But when I have to explain it to others,\n\n1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:24.920\n like here's what I did.\n\n1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:26.240\n And this is the mistake I made\n\n1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:27.680\n or whatever the case may be.\n\n1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:31.000\n It actually, I think that helps me.\n\n1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.440\n Yeah, so you're held responsible by a larger audience.\n\n1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:35.640\n I think it's like, so like I said,\n\n1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:38.400\n listen, I'm 47, my life is good.\n\n1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:39.560\n I don't have to be in this tournament.\n\n1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:42.920\n If I'm over it, I can just dump my chips off and go home.\n\n1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:45.240\n But I can't when I'm doing the vlog,\n\n1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:48.080\n like I have to actually answer to that.\n\n1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:51.080\n And it keeps me in line.\n\n1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:53.960\n How hard is it to win the main event\n\n1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:56.240\n of the World Series of Poker?\n\n1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:57.600\n So the main event of the World Series of Poker\n\n1:34:57.600 --> 1:34:59.320\n is the hardest event to win\n\n1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:01.640\n simply because of the sheer size of it.\n\n1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:04.320\n You're talking seven, 8,000 players, right?\n\n1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:05.440\n And a lot of landmines.\n\n1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:08.800\n And frankly, there are so many players\n\n1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:10.840\n that you've not played with before too.\n\n1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:12.880\n You play these high roller events, like the super ones,\n\n1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:15.360\n you get 30, 40 people, you know everybody, right?\n\n1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:16.880\n So you have an idea.\n\n1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:19.240\n You sit at the main event, you don't have any idea.\n\n1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:21.040\n This guy wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey\n\n1:35:21.040 --> 1:35:23.200\n and sunglasses, and he just raised you big.\n\n1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:26.120\n I don't know this guy, I don't know what he's about.\n\n1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.280\n So there's a lot of like, it's grueling too.\n\n1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:32.720\n You're seven, eight days where you're in the blender\n\n1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:35.200\n as you might say, so.\n\n1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:36.120\n So what's the structure?\n\n1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:38.640\n So it's $10,000 buy in or something like that.\n\n1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:41.960\n And there's a bunch of tables and you just keep playing.\n\n1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:44.800\n Like when is it over for a single table?\n\n1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:45.640\n Does it go?\n\n1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:46.480\n So the way that it works is this.\n\n1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:47.840\n So there's, let's say 8,000 players.\n\n1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:50.180\n And the way the main event works, unique to others,\n\n1:35:50.180 --> 1:35:53.240\n is there's various day ones you can play, right?\n\n1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:55.160\n So a day one, you're gonna play from noon\n\n1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:57.320\n till like midnight, right?\n\n1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:00.040\n If you're still in, you bag up your chips\n\n1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:02.080\n and you'll come back for day two, okay?\n\n1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:04.360\n There's four different day ones, right?\n\n1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:07.040\n Now they'll all combine essentially to play on a day two.\n\n1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:09.800\n And at the end of the night, they redraw the tables.\n\n1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.140\n So you don't just win your table.\n\n1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:13.680\n If players get knocked out, tables break,\n\n1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:15.280\n they continue to be replaced.\n\n1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:18.120\n So you start with 8,000, then after day one,\n\n1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:20.940\n you've got 6,000, then you do the same.\n\n1:36:20.940 --> 1:36:25.360\n You play like a 12 hour day and you slowly whittle down.\n\n1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:28.520\n Day four, day three, day four, you're in the money.\n\n1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:29.840\n And then you continue to progress.\n\n1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:32.480\n And then what they do now with the final table is they,\n\n1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:34.360\n because they were trying to do this for TV,\n\n1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:38.760\n these final tables can take, you know, 12 hours to play.\n\n1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:41.080\n And what we were finding was, you know,\n\n1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:44.560\n you start the thing at 5 p.m. and it goes till 8 a.m.\n\n1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:45.960\n And like nobody's watching anymore.\n\n1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:49.320\n So they separate into three days now.\n\n1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:52.160\n And so you're talking now, it's like six, seven days\n\n1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:54.620\n to get to the final table and another three days to play it.\n\n1:36:54.620 --> 1:36:58.840\n So you're grinding for, you know, a week and a half.\n\n1:36:58.840 --> 1:37:01.880\n But most of the time you're playing against people\n\n1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:03.840\n you've never played against before.\n\n1:37:03.840 --> 1:37:04.880\n Especially early on, yeah.\n\n1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:06.440\n And then by the end, like, who knows?\n\n1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:09.580\n You know, rarely do you see, you see in the last hundred,\n\n1:37:09.580 --> 1:37:11.480\n you usually see some notable names.\n\n1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:13.760\n Then in the last 27, you might see one, maybe two.\n\n1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:15.460\n Final table, maybe one.\n\n1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:17.600\n But often it's gonna be, you know,\n\n1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:20.040\n some players you've never heard of before.\n\n1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:24.080\n Is there strategies that maximize your likelihood\n\n1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:25.440\n of having a chance?\n\n1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:26.400\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:28.000\n Like I think the World Series of Poker main event\n\n1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.280\n is a unique animal in that, you know,\n\n1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:32.360\n like we talk about game theory and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:34.160\n If you're focused on that when you're playing,\n\n1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:36.660\n you're really not playing well, right?\n\n1:37:36.660 --> 1:37:38.280\n You need to just exploit\n\n1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:39.600\n because you're gonna have a lot of people\n\n1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:41.280\n who see this as a bucket list item.\n\n1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:42.120\n You know, they just wanna play\n\n1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:43.560\n the main event in the World Series.\n\n1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:45.880\n And they might be scared, they might be nervous or whatever.\n\n1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:48.760\n You don't have to worry about being balanced, right?\n\n1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:51.160\n Oh, you know, I have to make sure that I'm, no you don't.\n\n1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:52.640\n You might not, you're playing with this guy now\n\n1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:54.720\n for three hours, you might never see him again.\n\n1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:57.680\n So just make the play that makes sense for you, right?\n\n1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:01.000\n So yeah, you're gonna, I approach that event\n\n1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.640\n very differently than I would\n\n1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:04.760\n like playing against the high roller players\n\n1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:05.600\n that I play with today.\n\n1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:07.200\n Does that mean more aggressive essentially?\n\n1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:08.760\n Less actually.\n\n1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:11.880\n So when you play against really good players,\n\n1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:15.440\n you have to take small plus EV scenarios\n\n1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:17.000\n where you push the envelope\n\n1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:18.120\n and you're playing really aggressive.\n\n1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:19.440\n You're bluffing off your stack.\n\n1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:20.280\n You gotta do this.\n\n1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:22.720\n You gotta focus a little bit more on being balanced\n\n1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:23.760\n because otherwise, you know,\n\n1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:25.460\n you're not gonna beat these guys.\n\n1:38:25.460 --> 1:38:27.120\n Whereas if you're playing with amateurs\n\n1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:28.800\n and you're playing with regular players,\n\n1:38:28.800 --> 1:38:33.200\n for the most part, risking all your chips on a bluff,\n\n1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:34.720\n probably don't need to do that.\n\n1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:35.760\n You don't need to do that nearly as much.\n\n1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:39.360\n You can probably slowly but surely build your stack\n\n1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:41.160\n without taking, you know, those high risk,\n\n1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:42.000\n high variance situations\n\n1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.060\n because you'll find better situations.\n\n1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:47.240\n What mistakes do amateurs usually make\n\n1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:48.720\n in tournaments like that?\n\n1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:50.160\n Are they over bluffing?\n\n1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:52.300\n Well, I think amateurs generally,\n\n1:38:52.300 --> 1:38:53.720\n the biggest mistake they make is they think\n\n1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:56.240\n that pros are bluffing more than they are.\n\n1:38:56.240 --> 1:38:57.960\n So like a pro will bet all his chips on the end\n\n1:38:57.960 --> 1:38:58.960\n and they're like, ah, I don't know.\n\n1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:00.440\n Maybe, you know, it's Phil Ivey.\n\n1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:01.480\n Maybe he's doing some crazy stuff.\n\n1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:02.960\n He's like, probably not.\n\n1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:05.760\n He's probably just got it, you know?\n\n1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:08.020\n And then they lose all their money by calling\n\n1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:09.640\n or going all in as well.\n\n1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:15.040\n And so the right thing is to be more patient.\n\n1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:19.080\n So amateur is too impatient or just bad reads?\n\n1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:21.160\n So all the amateurs are built different.\n\n1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:23.400\n Some of the amateurs are just too weak and passive.\n\n1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:25.440\n They're just waiting for the nuts, you know?\n\n1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.360\n And then, you know, the pros, everyone notices that.\n\n1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:29.200\n And then when they make their big hand,\n\n1:39:29.200 --> 1:39:30.640\n they don't get paid anyway.\n\n1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:32.840\n So in order to win the main event,\n\n1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:35.000\n I mean, you have to have some components\n\n1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.520\n of your game that are aggressive.\n\n1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:39.960\n It's very unlikely to expect to just get the cards\n\n1:39:39.960 --> 1:39:42.440\n the whole way and just always have the best hand.\n\n1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:44.560\n You're gonna have to find ways to win pots\n\n1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:47.080\n that, you know, where you don't have the best hand.\n\n1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:49.640\n How do you win the final table?\n\n1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:51.200\n The final table is unique now,\n\n1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:53.440\n especially because you're talking about the way\n\n1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:55.520\n that poker works in tournaments is that\n\n1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:56.900\n if there's seven people left\n\n1:39:56.900 --> 1:39:59.560\n and you have just, you know, you're very short on chips.\n\n1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:01.520\n But if one other player goes out,\n\n1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:04.640\n you just make like $300,000 for folding,\n\n1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:06.760\n like just for sitting out, right?\n\n1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:08.800\n The term for that that, you know,\n\n1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:13.080\n show kids uses ICM, independent, you know, chip model,\n\n1:40:13.080 --> 1:40:15.460\n right, where it talks about the value of each chip.\n\n1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:17.440\n Where what happens, what we see now is,\n\n1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:19.600\n let's say one guy has a big chip lead\n\n1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:21.340\n and there's another guy who's second in chips\n\n1:40:21.340 --> 1:40:22.760\n and there's a couple that are short.\n\n1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:25.960\n These guys in the middle, they just play super tight\n\n1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:28.280\n and they wait for the little guys to go\n\n1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:31.600\n while the big stack is just pounding them\n\n1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.520\n because he can afford to, right?\n\n1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:35.000\n He knows that people are handcuffed.\n\n1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.840\n So let's say I had 10 million in chips\n\n1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:38.240\n and you have 9 million in chips.\n\n1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:39.160\n And these guys have little chips.\n\n1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:42.040\n If I go all in on you, are you gonna call me\n\n1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:45.320\n and risk like, you know, guaranteed pay jumps\n\n1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:46.680\n of like moving up a few spots?\n\n1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:48.540\n So really the question comes down to like,\n\n1:40:48.540 --> 1:40:51.440\n are you the type of guy who just wants to inch up\n\n1:40:51.440 --> 1:40:52.920\n or are you gonna go for it?\n\n1:40:52.920 --> 1:40:54.000\n And you're gonna go for the win.\n\n1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000\n I think ultimately there's some value\n\n1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:56.920\n in being the guy who says,\n\n1:40:56.920 --> 1:40:58.660\n you know, I don't care if I come seventh.\n\n1:40:58.660 --> 1:41:01.440\n I'm not worried about going from seventh to fifth.\n\n1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:02.560\n I'm here to win.\n\n1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:04.840\n And so you're saying like the guys that win\n\n1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:07.080\n will often be the ones that call there.\n\n1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:10.800\n So like, they're not just bullying the small stacks, they're.\n\n1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:11.800\n Well, they're the ones,\n\n1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:14.480\n no, they're the ones that are willing to risk it, right?\n\n1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:16.800\n So there are some people who, you know,\n\n1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:19.800\n if there's five left, you know,\n\n1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:21.200\n and they're third in chips\n\n1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:22.320\n and there's two guys very short\n\n1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:24.280\n and you, you know, they'll have ace king\n\n1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:26.060\n and someone moves, they'll just fold.\n\n1:41:26.060 --> 1:41:28.760\n They fold the hand because they wanna wait\n\n1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:30.620\n for those two other players to get broke.\n\n1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:32.280\n And that way they let you know, they make actual money.\n\n1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:33.640\n So you, I guess the thought process\n\n1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:35.280\n between winning first place\n\n1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.440\n and winning the most amount of money are different.\n\n1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:39.240\n They're conflicting, right?\n\n1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:41.360\n Because in order to like win,\n\n1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:43.180\n if you're just, if your focus is only on winning\n\n1:41:43.180 --> 1:41:45.040\n the tournament, you will make mistakes financially\n\n1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:47.680\n where you had guaranteed income for just folding, right?\n\n1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:51.540\n Let's say a guy has one chip left, you know, one chip\n\n1:41:51.540 --> 1:41:53.320\n and me and you have good chips\n\n1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:55.240\n and I go all in with you and I lose.\n\n1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:57.680\n Now that guy, you know, got the guaranteed,\n\n1:41:57.680 --> 1:41:59.460\n you know, he got the pay jump that I wouldn't have got.\n\n1:41:59.460 --> 1:42:00.840\n So there's some extremely stupid mistakes\n\n1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:02.780\n you can make from a financial perspective,\n\n1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:05.580\n but it's often at odds with, you know,\n\n1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:08.720\n giving yourself the best chance to actually come first.\n\n1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:11.240\n And in a tournament, especially the main event,\n\n1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:15.080\n especially the final table, it's all about coming in first.\n\n1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:17.520\n Well, I know because most of the people who make it,\n\n1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:19.420\n so like, you know, when you play these high rollers,\n\n1:42:19.420 --> 1:42:21.520\n these guys are accustomed to playing for a hundred thousand,\n\n1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:23.040\n they're, they're accustomed to this kind of money.\n\n1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:24.240\n So they're going to play, right?\n\n1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:25.760\n For the most, but you're talking about guys\n\n1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:27.240\n who bought into a $10,000 tournament,\n\n1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:29.600\n maybe never had a hundred K cash in their life.\n\n1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:32.500\n And now they're sitting there and it's like 1 million\n\n1:42:32.500 --> 1:42:34.340\n for fifth and 2 million for fourth.\n\n1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:37.400\n So like, they don't want to be fifth,\n\n1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:39.640\n they're just going to sit there and go, ah, I don't want.\n\n1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:41.760\n So they'll, they'll be under more financial pressure\n\n1:42:41.760 --> 1:42:44.440\n because they're not like your typical high roller\n\n1:42:44.440 --> 1:42:45.260\n type player.\n\n1:42:45.260 --> 1:42:48.920\n Are you still able to find the guts to take big risks?\n\n1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:50.800\n Yeah, see, I'm trying to win.\n\n1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:53.180\n Like, I think that gives me an advantage, frankly,\n\n1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:57.320\n where I might make decisions that are financially suboptimal\n\n1:42:57.320 --> 1:42:58.880\n because I'm trying to win,\n\n1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:01.040\n but there's also an inherent advantage to that.\n\n1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:04.040\n Like that again, something I watched and learned\n\n1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:05.880\n from a guy like Michael Adamo,\n\n1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:08.040\n where he takes advantage of these people playing\n\n1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:09.920\n so passively in these spots where he's like,\n\n1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:11.920\n I don't, I'm not trying to come, I'm going to win.\n\n1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:14.120\n I'm just going to bull bulldoze you.\n\n1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:16.160\n Cause I'm not worried about, you know,\n\n1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:21.160\n the small financial mistake of, you know, a pay jump.\n\n1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:25.560\n What advice could you give to, to beginning poker players?\n\n1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:27.760\n Actually at every level, how to get better,\n\n1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:30.240\n how to improve, how to improve their game.\n\n1:43:30.240 --> 1:43:32.140\n Obviously, as you said,\n\n1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:34.900\n it's easiest to get better in the beginning,\n\n1:43:34.900 --> 1:43:37.320\n but what advice would you give how to get better?\n\n1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:38.320\n So one of the ways, I mean,\n\n1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:40.200\n I think way back to the how I started, right?\n\n1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:42.480\n And there's so many resources and tools available right now\n\n1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:45.960\n to analyze hands, but when you play, right?\n\n1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:48.400\n And you find yourself in a situation or a hand\n\n1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:49.320\n that you're not really sure about,\n\n1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:52.440\n not because you had aces and went all in and you lost,\n\n1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:53.560\n like that's not interesting,\n\n1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:55.200\n but an interesting situation where you're not sure\n\n1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:59.200\n what you did, jot the hand down, write it out.\n\n1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:02.000\n And then either A, you know, use some of the tools,\n\n1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.800\n whether it's the solvers, if you're advanced enough,\n\n1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:07.240\n or ask your group, you know,\n\n1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:09.080\n like have a couple of friends at your level\n\n1:44:09.080 --> 1:44:10.760\n and talk through the different decisions\n\n1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:12.620\n and start to learn that way, right?\n\n1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:13.860\n Cause those mistakes that you make\n\n1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:15.620\n or those tough, those tough hands,\n\n1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:17.280\n that's where the real learning comes from.\n\n1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:19.720\n Like, so that next, so basically if you're,\n\n1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:21.480\n cause you're gonna be in similar scenarios.\n\n1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:24.320\n In poker, you're rarely gonna have the identical situation,\n\n1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:26.520\n but you'll have situations that are similar.\n\n1:44:26.520 --> 1:44:28.600\n You know, you raise with ace king, someone three bet,\n\n1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:29.760\n another guy goes all in.\n\n1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:31.800\n Okay, well, what do I do in that spot?\n\n1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:34.380\n You know, it's, you're gonna have similar situations\n\n1:44:34.380 --> 1:44:35.220\n in the future as well.\n\n1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:38.120\n So figuring that out, the more you can do that,\n\n1:44:38.120 --> 1:44:40.680\n you chop away at, you know,\n\n1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:42.640\n different strategical mistakes, you know,\n\n1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:44.980\n you used to make that you no longer make.\n\n1:44:44.980 --> 1:44:48.240\n Are there resources like your masterclasses really is great?\n\n1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:49.980\n Are there books?\n\n1:44:49.980 --> 1:44:51.840\n So there was a guy named Michael Acevedo.\n\n1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:54.200\n This is my, again, for a little bit more advanced players,\n\n1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:57.220\n but it's a book called a modern poker theory,\n\n1:44:57.220 --> 1:44:58.740\n I think it's called,\n\n1:44:58.740 --> 1:45:01.080\n which sort of explains game theory, right?\n\n1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:02.840\n To the novice, right?\n\n1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:05.320\n So it's a little bit, I think if you're new to poker,\n\n1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:08.360\n it's probably above the rim for you.\n\n1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:09.960\n But once you start to get a little better\n\n1:45:09.960 --> 1:45:11.580\n and you wanna understand how to do it,\n\n1:45:11.580 --> 1:45:13.360\n it's probably a good resource for as far as books.\n\n1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:14.720\n And there's also like tons of people\n\n1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:17.060\n who stream poker, professional players.\n\n1:45:17.060 --> 1:45:19.040\n And then you can get in there and you get in on the chat\n\n1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:20.460\n and you start talking, you ask them,\n\n1:45:20.460 --> 1:45:21.680\n you see people, you know,\n\n1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:23.880\n explaining their thought process and things like that.\n\n1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:25.360\n There's so many free resources.\n\n1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:26.520\n And of course my masterclass,\n\n1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:28.760\n I think does a good job of sort of compartmentalizing,\n\n1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:32.440\n like, you know, how to attack it on a deeper level.\n\n1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:34.600\n And we, you know, we get it, I try to get into,\n\n1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:36.860\n what's funny when I did the masterclass,\n\n1:45:36.860 --> 1:45:38.820\n I asked them, I was like, well, you know,\n\n1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:41.640\n how high end do you want this in terms of poker?\n\n1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:42.960\n And they're like, we want really, really high end.\n\n1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:44.440\n And I was like, okay, sure.\n\n1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:46.040\n Then I started to explain really, really high end.\n\n1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:50.400\n I'm like, okay, well, maybe the one below that, right?\n\n1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:54.880\n So I try to explain really complex, you know,\n\n1:45:54.880 --> 1:45:58.800\n theory in a more palatable way, in English, if you will.\n\n1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:00.240\n Cause some of these kids, you hear them talk\n\n1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:02.160\n and you'd be like, huh?\n\n1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:06.200\n But you also, which is really nice, give example hands\n\n1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:10.440\n that really illustrate the point, which is really nice.\n\n1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:13.400\n You also wrote a book, I think 10 years ago,\n\n1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:14.880\n Power Holding Strategy.\n\n1:46:16.200 --> 1:46:19.200\n It's interesting to think how much of the stuff\n\n1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:21.320\n in that book still applies, how much doesn't.\n\n1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:23.720\n Listen, I still think the book holds up to a certain degree.\n\n1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:26.400\n Obviously like, you know, it isn't optimal\n\n1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:28.320\n because there's like a more advanced strategies.\n\n1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:29.280\n And if you played that way,\n\n1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:30.880\n people will figure out a way to exploit you.\n\n1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:32.560\n But if you're like an average player playing\n\n1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:35.160\n an average buy ins, like that's sort of what I coined,\n\n1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:38.120\n like small ball approach, absolutely will work.\n\n1:46:38.120 --> 1:46:39.800\n You know, at the highest level,\n\n1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:42.340\n you have to add much more, a lot more bluffing.\n\n1:46:42.340 --> 1:46:44.600\n But overall, I think it's still, you know,\n\n1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:45.760\n for the most part, there's a lot of really,\n\n1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:46.640\n especially with tournaments,\n\n1:46:46.640 --> 1:46:48.920\n there's a lot of really good principles in the book.\n\n1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:50.680\n What's the difference in the dynamics,\n\n1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:53.920\n if you could just comment on between a heads up poker\n\n1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:56.520\n and when multiple people are in one hand,\n\n1:46:56.520 --> 1:46:58.400\n what are interesting aspects to everything\n\n1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:01.320\n we've been talking about from game theory\n\n1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:04.620\n to exploitative strategies, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:47:04.620 --> 1:47:06.040\n So the biggest difference when you play,\n\n1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:07.700\n let's say nine handed, you know,\n\n1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:11.200\n against eight other players and you know, heads up is,\n\n1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:13.720\n first of all, just the type of hands\n\n1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:15.160\n and the number of hands you're gonna have to play.\n\n1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:18.120\n So the way that it works is if there's nine people,\n\n1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:20.300\n two out of the nine hands, you have to put in money.\n\n1:47:20.300 --> 1:47:22.760\n And the other seven, you could just fold for nothing, okay?\n\n1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:23.800\n When you're heads up,\n\n1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:27.440\n you're forced to put money in every single hand, okay?\n\n1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:29.720\n And there's only one other hand in front of you,\n\n1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:31.720\n which means the ranges of hands that you play\n\n1:47:31.720 --> 1:47:33.480\n is way wider, right?\n\n1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:35.040\n So if you're nine handed, right?\n\n1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:36.720\n And you're in first position, you're like, all right,\n\n1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:37.880\n what do I need to play?\n\n1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:41.680\n Like a good pair, you know, two high cards suited,\n\n1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:44.160\n a big ace, you know, stuff like that, that's it, right?\n\n1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:46.320\n That's what you're gonna play, right?\n\n1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:47.600\n And you're gonna fold all the rest.\n\n1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:50.600\n When you're heads up, you look at a king and a two\n\n1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:52.360\n and you're like, well, I gotta play this.\n\n1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:53.540\n You know, you're gonna, you're gonna,\n\n1:47:53.540 --> 1:47:55.720\n you're forced to play a lot more hands\n\n1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:57.400\n in a lot more complex situations\n\n1:47:57.400 --> 1:47:59.860\n when you're playing heads up,\n\n1:47:59.860 --> 1:48:02.520\n because you're gonna be playing much far weaker hands.\n\n1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:05.480\n Queen five, Jack three, all these types of hands.\n\n1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:06.920\n And you're gonna see flops where you're,\n\n1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:08.600\n you're not gonna have the luxury of being like,\n\n1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:11.680\n I'm in there with a premium hand, queens, kings, aces.\n\n1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:13.080\n Those are easier to play, right?\n\n1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:14.680\n Very, very strong holdings.\n\n1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:19.360\n Heads up, you're forced to dance and fight a lot more.\n\n1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:21.520\n You know, you can't sit in the weeds and wait.\n\n1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:22.720\n What do you enjoy more?\n\n1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:25.700\n Heads up is very intense.\n\n1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:29.520\n I like heads up, but I think if you had to play heads up\n\n1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:31.960\n eight, 10 hours, it's so mentally draining\n\n1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:34.760\n because your face with so many constant decisions\n\n1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:35.600\n each and every spot.\n\n1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:37.980\n Like you play nine handed, you look at a nine and a three,\n\n1:48:37.980 --> 1:48:40.720\n you throw it away, you hang out for a bit, relax,\n\n1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:42.240\n you go, you get a little break and then play hand.\n\n1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:44.000\n Heads up, you're like, it's like, boom, boom.\n\n1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:45.200\n It's like you're in the ring, you know,\n\n1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:47.640\n you're in the octagon and you're facing like\n\n1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:49.040\n haymakers nonstop.\n\n1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:53.720\n Since we talked about online a bit,\n\n1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:56.840\n is it possible to cheat in poker, especially online?\n\n1:48:56.840 --> 1:49:00.320\n So we offline also talked about the cheating controversy\n\n1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:02.120\n that's going on in the chess world.\n\n1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:06.660\n Is it possible to use, what is it?\n\n1:49:06.660 --> 1:49:10.980\n Remotely connected anal beads to somehow cheat?\n\n1:49:10.980 --> 1:49:15.820\n No, is that a concern of cheating online?\n\n1:49:15.820 --> 1:49:19.140\n So here's the thing, it's kind of like romanticized\n\n1:49:19.140 --> 1:49:21.280\n from the old days, like, you know, in the Western stuff,\n\n1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:22.120\n like people trying to cheat.\n\n1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:24.140\n And have you ever killed a man because he cheated?\n\n1:49:24.140 --> 1:49:25.100\n No, I have not.\n\n1:49:25.100 --> 1:49:26.980\n But when I started out as a teenager,\n\n1:49:26.980 --> 1:49:28.820\n I played in a game with a bunch of Italians\n\n1:49:28.820 --> 1:49:31.160\n and I knew they cheated and I didn't care\n\n1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:33.700\n because they were so bad that I could win anyway.\n\n1:49:33.700 --> 1:49:34.780\n I was like, I knew they would cheat,\n\n1:49:34.780 --> 1:49:35.700\n but I knew how they were cheating.\n\n1:49:35.700 --> 1:49:37.140\n So I was like, all right, you guys suck.\n\n1:49:37.140 --> 1:49:37.980\n But so here's the thing,\n\n1:49:37.980 --> 1:49:40.960\n anytime you're talking about large sums of money,\n\n1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:43.580\n there will be people looking to take advantage,\n\n1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:45.820\n whether that's live or online, right?\n\n1:49:45.820 --> 1:49:49.620\n And so it's like the job essentially of the, you know,\n\n1:49:49.620 --> 1:49:52.940\n the online operators or the, you know, live event staff\n\n1:49:52.940 --> 1:49:54.560\n to police it the best they can.\n\n1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:56.620\n And the players themselves being on the lookout for it.\n\n1:49:56.620 --> 1:49:58.940\n You know, like a guy like Dole Brunson is a great resource\n\n1:49:58.940 --> 1:50:01.500\n because he's seen it all and he's seen all the tricks,\n\n1:50:01.500 --> 1:50:02.900\n you know, and so live, you know,\n\n1:50:02.900 --> 1:50:04.460\n he probably could spot a few things.\n\n1:50:04.460 --> 1:50:07.500\n But online, there's various ways people can try to cheat,\n\n1:50:07.500 --> 1:50:12.500\n but there's also really good security measures in place\n\n1:50:12.700 --> 1:50:14.380\n to catch them, you know?\n\n1:50:14.380 --> 1:50:16.660\n And we've caught, you know, like about two years ago,\n\n1:50:16.660 --> 1:50:20.420\n there was a huge undertaking of like 500 accounts\n\n1:50:20.420 --> 1:50:22.700\n that were banned for doing different things.\n\n1:50:22.700 --> 1:50:24.980\n And, you know, there's, and again, you can't go in,\n\n1:50:24.980 --> 1:50:27.840\n they can't go into detail in terms of how they're doing it.\n\n1:50:27.840 --> 1:50:29.940\n Cause otherwise, you know, then you're sort of giving\n\n1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:32.580\n the cheats the playbook in terms of how to take advantage.\n\n1:50:32.580 --> 1:50:34.580\n But it's always gonna be a concern for poker\n\n1:50:34.580 --> 1:50:36.660\n wherever you play, right?\n\n1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:40.340\n But it's not something I'm worried about personally.\n\n1:50:40.340 --> 1:50:42.460\n So at the highest in person, and by the way,\n\n1:50:42.460 --> 1:50:44.500\n online there's really interesting algorithms\n\n1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:46.660\n that do some of the work in an automated way\n\n1:50:46.660 --> 1:50:50.060\n to detect, to flag things that are weird.\n\n1:50:50.060 --> 1:50:52.660\n But in person, it's just not something at the highest level\n\n1:50:52.660 --> 1:50:54.220\n that you're super concerned about.\n\n1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:58.100\n So it's not, it didn't quite infiltrate the poker world\n\n1:50:58.100 --> 1:51:00.020\n to a degree where it's a huge concern.\n\n1:51:00.020 --> 1:51:01.740\n Yeah, like, so here's the thing.\n\n1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:04.020\n I don't play in private games and whatever, right?\n\n1:51:04.020 --> 1:51:06.200\n But in private games, theoretically, you know,\n\n1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:07.820\n you could be in, if you don't trust the people\n\n1:51:07.820 --> 1:51:09.900\n you're playing with, like I've heard stories of people\n\n1:51:09.900 --> 1:51:11.700\n where, you know, they have an earpiece in\n\n1:51:11.700 --> 1:51:13.380\n that you can't see, right?\n\n1:51:13.380 --> 1:51:17.140\n And they have, you know, like RFID on the cards\n\n1:51:17.140 --> 1:51:19.860\n or something like that, and they have a phone reading it.\n\n1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:21.460\n So they have somebody in a truck telling them,\n\n1:51:21.460 --> 1:51:23.060\n you're gonna win this hand, you're gonna lose this hand.\n\n1:51:23.060 --> 1:51:24.860\n Like that happened in a private game.\n\n1:51:24.860 --> 1:51:26.700\n You know, and the guy, what's often funny\n\n1:51:26.700 --> 1:51:30.120\n about some of these people who cheat is they're so greedy\n\n1:51:30.120 --> 1:51:32.420\n and blatantly obvious that they get caught.\n\n1:51:32.420 --> 1:51:35.120\n Where if they use this tool in a more subtle way,\n\n1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:37.320\n they could probably continue to get away with it.\n\n1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:39.620\n But again, that's not something I worry about\n\n1:51:39.620 --> 1:51:42.740\n in a casino environment, you know, in these tournaments\n\n1:51:42.740 --> 1:51:43.860\n and things like that.\n\n1:51:43.860 --> 1:51:45.820\n But if I was playing in private games,\n\n1:51:45.820 --> 1:51:48.180\n like if I came down to Texas and some guy,\n\n1:51:48.180 --> 1:51:51.560\n I got cheated in a game by a guy named Blackie Blackburn\n\n1:51:51.560 --> 1:51:55.460\n and Tex, I was at the Chimo Hotel, I was a teenager\n\n1:51:55.460 --> 1:51:56.740\n and they saw me playing, you know,\n\n1:51:56.740 --> 1:51:58.420\n I was making good money as a teenager.\n\n1:51:58.420 --> 1:52:00.820\n I had like a $13,000 bankroll, you know,\n\n1:52:00.820 --> 1:52:02.060\n and I went and played in this game with them\n\n1:52:02.060 --> 1:52:04.220\n in a private hotel room and found out later\n\n1:52:04.220 --> 1:52:06.620\n that the guy was a card mechanic, you know,\n\n1:52:06.620 --> 1:52:08.860\n he was dealing and he could, you know, deal you the hands\n\n1:52:08.860 --> 1:52:10.700\n and he knew what you had and stuff like that.\n\n1:52:10.700 --> 1:52:12.140\n So yeah, I remember, you know,\n\n1:52:12.140 --> 1:52:14.500\n I lost a big number in that game\n\n1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:16.980\n and it was a good learning lesson in terms of, you know,\n\n1:52:16.980 --> 1:52:18.380\n being wary of who you trust.\n\n1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:22.120\n Yeah, so if the dealer is in on it,\n\n1:52:22.120 --> 1:52:23.840\n that's one way you could cheat.\n\n1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:25.440\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:27.440\n That's part of the reason that they cut.\n\n1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:30.800\n So like, you'll see like, there's a burn card\n\n1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:32.120\n because what would happen in, you know,\n\n1:52:32.120 --> 1:52:33.680\n maybe in the old days is like,\n\n1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:34.700\n if you're sitting in the one seat,\n\n1:52:34.700 --> 1:52:36.440\n I could lift the card and you could see it,\n\n1:52:36.440 --> 1:52:38.080\n the next card coming, right?\n\n1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:40.040\n So what they do is they have a card on top of it\n\n1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:41.200\n that you burn that isn't the card\n\n1:52:41.200 --> 1:52:44.020\n and then the next card is the one that comes face up.\n\n1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:48.640\n I just learned about the edge sorting thing\n\n1:52:48.640 --> 1:52:52.040\n that Phil Ivey and maybe others were involved with.\n\n1:52:52.040 --> 1:52:55.680\n I just, reading it at first was super interesting to me\n\n1:52:55.680 --> 1:52:59.520\n that you can exploit the imperfections\n\n1:52:59.520 --> 1:53:01.560\n in the printing of cards.\n\n1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:02.840\n That was almost cool to me.\n\n1:53:02.840 --> 1:53:05.840\n That's almost not cheating because it's like.\n\n1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:07.280\n That needs to be a movie.\n\n1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:08.760\n That needs to be a movie, yes.\n\n1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:10.760\n Yeah, what happened with Phil Ivey in that whole case\n\n1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:12.900\n is it's a catastrophe, really.\n\n1:53:12.900 --> 1:53:14.840\n It is such a horrible precedent.\n\n1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:15.780\n Cause here's what he did.\n\n1:53:15.780 --> 1:53:17.300\n Phil Ivey shows up at the casino says,\n\n1:53:17.300 --> 1:53:18.160\n I want to play this game.\n\n1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:20.600\n They say, okay, all right, I want to play with those decks.\n\n1:53:20.600 --> 1:53:24.040\n They say, okay, they agree to everything that he says.\n\n1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:25.400\n He never touches the cards.\n\n1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:28.200\n He doesn't do anything outside of the fact\n\n1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:30.360\n that your cards that you supplied\n\n1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:33.040\n have imperfections on them and he can see them.\n\n1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:35.680\n Okay, so that increases his chances of winning.\n\n1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:38.040\n He could still lose theoretically, right?\n\n1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:39.860\n Probably not, but he can lose.\n\n1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:41.800\n In theory, it just gives him a little bit of an edge\n\n1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:44.200\n and it's all stuff based on what you provided.\n\n1:53:44.200 --> 1:53:45.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:48.400\n So the idea that you offered a game, I accepted, I beat you\n\n1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:50.280\n and now you want to free roll me?\n\n1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:51.680\n That's disgusting.\n\n1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:53.800\n So for people who don't know, maybe you can elaborate\n\n1:53:53.800 --> 1:53:55.160\n and it's just fascinating to me,\n\n1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:57.280\n but you're exploiting the imperfections\n\n1:53:57.280 --> 1:53:59.440\n in the card patterns on the back\n\n1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:01.760\n and then they look different if you rotate it.\n\n1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:04.840\n And the fascinating thing too, when you shuffle,\n\n1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:06.940\n usually you don't rotate the cards\n\n1:54:06.940 --> 1:54:11.440\n so that you can see the sort of\n\n1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:15.800\n detect which cards are the strong cards by marking them\n\n1:54:15.800 --> 1:54:17.800\n by through rotating them.\n\n1:54:17.800 --> 1:54:19.240\n And the way you know they're rotated\n\n1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:21.480\n is because of the pattern imperfections.\n\n1:54:21.480 --> 1:54:23.280\n Yeah, so some of the cards, like you said,\n\n1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:26.040\n like they had that pattern on it\n\n1:54:26.040 --> 1:54:28.400\n and some of them, this was faulty cards on there,\n\n1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:29.680\n were not cut properly.\n\n1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:33.860\n So like the eights and nines had the card cut differently\n\n1:54:33.860 --> 1:54:35.600\n and those are important cards in this game,\n\n1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:36.780\n the eights and nines or whatever.\n\n1:54:36.780 --> 1:54:37.620\n So you could essentially,\n\n1:54:37.620 --> 1:54:39.280\n from looking at the back of the card,\n\n1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:41.800\n discern what it's gonna be.\n\n1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:45.000\n You do nothing in terms of like cheating yourself.\n\n1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:45.840\n You're not rigging the game.\n\n1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:47.400\n All you're doing is taking advantage of the fact\n\n1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:49.600\n that you're playing, you've offered me cards\n\n1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:51.280\n that are faulty.\n\n1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:54.200\n Can I just say that, of course, it would be Phil Ivey,\n\n1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:56.800\n who's the goat at the normal game\n\n1:54:56.800 --> 1:54:58.840\n who will figure out this particular thing.\n\n1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:00.600\n I mean, that's what, if you're into soccer,\n\n1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:03.840\n this Diego Maradona has that famous hand of God\n\n1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:07.200\n in the World Cup where he scores a goal with his hand.\n\n1:55:07.200 --> 1:55:10.080\n And so, of course, the referee didn't see it.\n\n1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:11.320\n They thought it was a header.\n\n1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:14.340\n So, I mean, part of the magic of the genius\n\n1:55:14.340 --> 1:55:15.540\n of the people at the top of the game\n\n1:55:15.540 --> 1:55:20.560\n is they're able to exploit all the flaws that are there.\n\n1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:21.400\n That's a beautiful thing to see.\n\n1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:24.200\n Well, see, Phil had, in his heyday,\n\n1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:28.240\n he had, he exploited weaknesses in casinos,\n\n1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:31.000\n systems all over the country.\n\n1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000\n Like in one night, I don't know if you know this story.\n\n1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.600\n In one night, he would take a plane, a private plane,\n\n1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:38.720\n and fly to 30 different casinos all over the country.\n\n1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:40.160\n Cause he would have these deals where they're like,\n\n1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:41.720\n all right, we've got this big rich sucker\n\n1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:43.080\n who's gonna come here and play craps\n\n1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:44.200\n and he's gonna lose all our money.\n\n1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:46.000\n So he'd have this deal with one of the casinos\n\n1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:47.520\n where they'd be like, all right,\n\n1:55:47.520 --> 1:55:50.520\n you get 20% back up to half a million, right?\n\n1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:53.480\n So if you lose half a million, we'll give you back 100K.\n\n1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:56.200\n So he'd go to one casino in Tunica,\n\n1:55:56.200 --> 1:56:00.920\n he'd play half a million, win, win or lose, he would leave.\n\n1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:02.400\n They think they're gonna get him to stay,\n\n1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:04.000\n they get him a big room or whatever.\n\n1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.880\n So let's say he goes to Tunica, he loses half a million.\n\n1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:08.760\n Now he goes, he flies to Atlantic city,\n\n1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:10.160\n he wins half a million.\n\n1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:12.520\n He lost half a million and won half a million,\n\n1:56:12.520 --> 1:56:14.200\n but he got 100,000 back.\n\n1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:16.440\n So he's actually plus 100,000.\n\n1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:17.920\n Do that at 10 casinos a night,\n\n1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:19.880\n you're making a million dollars in free equity.\n\n1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:21.480\n And they would give him promotional chips\n\n1:56:21.480 --> 1:56:23.320\n and all these kinds of things and free flights\n\n1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:24.200\n and stuff like that.\n\n1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:26.280\n So he took advantage of the image\n\n1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:27.240\n that they're trying to exploit.\n\n1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:29.680\n So this is why I don't have any empathy for these casinos.\n\n1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:31.480\n Cause they're giving you free drinks,\n\n1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:33.400\n they're giving you, why do you think they're doing that?\n\n1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:34.720\n The kindness of their heart.\n\n1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:36.160\n They're trying to exploit you.\n\n1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:37.080\n So guess what?\n\n1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:39.640\n You lost at your own game, pay the piper.\n\n1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:40.640\n And I think it was crazy.\n\n1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:43.120\n Cause the judges in his case said,\n\n1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:47.480\n he did not cheat, but yeah, it's probably not right.\n\n1:56:47.480 --> 1:56:48.360\n Hold on.\n\n1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:50.360\n You just said he didn't cheat.\n\n1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:52.520\n That should be the end of the case.\n\n1:56:52.520 --> 1:56:54.600\n And then the casinos do the funny thing.\n\n1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:56.200\n I mentioned to you, I was just at the UFC\n\n1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:59.960\n and Dana White is a huge gambler.\n\n1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:01.540\n She's a blackjack gambler.\n\n1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:04.280\n And there's that famous situation\n\n1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:05.800\n where you got kicked out of a casino\n\n1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:07.040\n and the casinos do that kind of thing\n\n1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:08.520\n when you win too much.\n\n1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:10.920\n So he won some ridiculous amount of money.\n\n1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:15.040\n He bets like, I mean, he plays like millions of dollars\n\n1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:16.640\n on hands of blackjack, it's insane.\n\n1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:19.440\n And so he won really big and he got kicked out.\n\n1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:20.520\n Was he counting?\n\n1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:21.640\n No, no, he wasn't counting.\n\n1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:23.680\n So counting in blackjack here in Las Vegas\n\n1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:25.460\n is like the only game where they actually\n\n1:57:25.460 --> 1:57:26.860\n can ask you not to play.\n\n1:57:26.860 --> 1:57:28.880\n So like basically if you're counting cards, right?\n\n1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:30.400\n You could potentially have an edge in blackjack\n\n1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:31.920\n and there are some professionals who do that,\n\n1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:33.520\n but they get caught pretty quickly.\n\n1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:34.720\n And then they say, you can play craps,\n\n1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:35.560\n you can play whatever you want,\n\n1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:36.800\n but you can't play blackjack here anymore.\n\n1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:38.960\n No, I think, I don't think Dana White is counting.\n\n1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:40.240\n I think he was winning a lot.\n\n1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:43.640\n I guess they can claim that they believe you're counting\n\n1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:45.040\n because how do you really know if you're counting?\n\n1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:47.120\n Well, they easily, they figure it out.\n\n1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:48.280\n So basically they have an eye in the sky\n\n1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:51.000\n and they can see, so if you're varying your bet size, right?\n\n1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:52.800\n So there are certain spots where based on the cards\n\n1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:54.640\n that are out, let's say for example,\n\n1:57:55.920 --> 1:57:57.640\n a lot of the twos, threes and fours and fives\n\n1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:58.680\n have been coming out.\n\n1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:01.720\n So the deck is rich in face cards.\n\n1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:03.580\n That's very good for the player, right?\n\n1:58:03.580 --> 1:58:06.840\n So imagine you were betting 500 bucks\n\n1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:09.980\n and then all of a sudden you up your bet to 2000 or 5,000\n\n1:58:09.980 --> 1:58:11.080\n when the deck is rich.\n\n1:58:11.080 --> 1:58:12.940\n They know when the deck is rich in high cards\n\n1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:14.720\n because they keep a counter themselves.\n\n1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:17.280\n So if they notice a player increasing their bet sizes\n\n1:58:17.280 --> 1:58:20.240\n when the deck is good for them, it's a telltale sign.\n\n1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:22.640\n Interesting, I don't think Dana White would be counting.\n\n1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:24.440\n And so casinos don't kick you out\n\n1:58:24.440 --> 1:58:26.160\n if you don't often kick you out.\n\n1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:28.760\n Do they ever kick you out if you make too much money?\n\n1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:30.640\n Because you're playing millions of dollars that they.\n\n1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:32.280\n Unless they, they would never kick you out\n\n1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:34.360\n for making too much money, unless they suspect cheating.\n\n1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:35.280\n Because why would they?\n\n1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:37.480\n They have an advantage, they want the money back.\n\n1:58:37.480 --> 1:58:38.640\n It's not like you go in there, win 10 million,\n\n1:58:38.640 --> 1:58:40.120\n you're like, oh no, that's enough for us.\n\n1:58:40.120 --> 1:58:42.000\n What about if he was talking shit the whole time?\n\n1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:42.840\n I wonder.\n\n1:58:42.840 --> 1:58:44.920\n I don't think that would matter.\n\n1:58:44.920 --> 1:58:48.100\n Because in the long run, they'll get the money back.\n\n1:58:48.100 --> 1:58:48.940\n Exactly.\n\n1:58:51.360 --> 1:58:54.600\n You tweeted, if you watched Jersey Shore,\n\n1:58:54.600 --> 1:58:57.400\n Family Vacation, we would probably get along really well.\n\n1:58:57.400 --> 1:58:59.880\n What is it about, because I lived in Jersey for a while,\n\n1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:03.360\n what is it about Jersey Shore characters that you love?\n\n1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:06.560\n I just love that they're sort of, I love the debauchery.\n\n1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:08.880\n I think Pauly D's a fun guy, you know,\n\n1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:11.040\n and just like, it's just something like,\n\n1:59:11.040 --> 1:59:13.560\n it's just, it's what do you call it?\n\n1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:15.680\n It's trash TV, it's a guilty pleasure.\n\n1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:17.520\n But you can just watch the Snooki get drunk\n\n1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:20.240\n and fallen all over herself or whatever.\n\n1:59:20.240 --> 1:59:23.400\n Is that part, do you love that part of Vegas as well?\n\n1:59:23.400 --> 1:59:25.280\n Not really, I don't go out and stuff,\n\n1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:27.020\n but I just like the characters.\n\n1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:30.080\n I like that they have unique personalities.\n\n1:59:30.080 --> 1:59:32.440\n And I think we live in a world now\n\n1:59:32.440 --> 1:59:36.560\n where people are more and more careful of what they say\n\n1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:38.440\n and afraid of backlash and all that stuff.\n\n1:59:38.440 --> 1:59:41.560\n And it's kind of like an old school version of just like,\n\n1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:43.240\n say what you feel, it's okay,\n\n1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:44.920\n as long as your intent is good.\n\n1:59:44.920 --> 1:59:49.920\n And they haven't been canceled, if you will, which is good,\n\n1:59:49.920 --> 1:59:53.960\n but I feel like their type of behavior slowly but surely,\n\n1:59:53.960 --> 1:59:56.120\n like, cause they got a lot of flack originally\n\n1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:59.800\n for misrepresenting like Italian Americans\n\n1:59:59.800 --> 2:00:00.640\n or something like that.\n\n2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:02.160\n Like there was a lot of backlash about this\n\n2:00:02.160 --> 2:00:04.960\n and how Italian Americans really are and blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:08.740\n So they sort of were representing that group of people\n\n2:00:08.740 --> 2:00:12.060\n and, you know, they received some backlash back in the day.\n\n2:00:13.160 --> 2:00:15.800\n I'm a huge supporter of diversity\n\n2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:19.120\n in all the beautiful forms that the human species\n\n2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:20.000\n is able to generate.\n\n2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.020\n And that's certainly one dimension.\n\n2:00:22.020 --> 2:00:25.180\n What's the greatest Vegas movie, would you say?\n\n2:00:25.180 --> 2:00:26.500\n I don't know if that's a difficult question,\n\n2:00:26.500 --> 2:00:28.680\n but Fear of Loathing in Las Vegas,\n\n2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:30.520\n Leaving Las Vegas, Casino.\n\n2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:32.540\n I watch, cause anytime Casino's on randomly,\n\n2:00:32.540 --> 2:00:33.720\n I always watch it.\n\n2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:34.960\n Such a great movie.\n\n2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:38.040\n It could be one of the Sharon Stone.\n\n2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:41.320\n Sharon, frankly, Sharon Stone reminded me,\n\n2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:42.160\n every time I would watch the movie,\n\n2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:45.600\n it reminded me of my wife, Amanda, like totally.\n\n2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:47.340\n I would see like the character and I was like,\n\n2:00:47.340 --> 2:00:49.440\n I'm the Robert De Niro character in the film.\n\n2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:52.960\n It was, I used to watch it through that lens, you know.\n\n2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:57.320\n From like the depth of love that you have.\n\n2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:00.020\n Just kind of, she was, I remember that she was like,\n\n2:01:00.020 --> 2:01:01.900\n she was like, she lit up every room.\n\n2:01:01.900 --> 2:01:03.080\n She does light up every room.\n\n2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:05.600\n She goes there, everybody's attracted and drawn to her.\n\n2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:07.220\n And she was kind of, when she was younger,\n\n2:01:07.220 --> 2:01:09.240\n she was a little wild and crazy and whatnot.\n\n2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:11.680\n So she reminded me of the Sharon Stone character.\n\n2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:13.920\n And then the Robert De Niro character is trying to like\n\n2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:16.040\n have a stable life, you know, and be that.\n\n2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:17.400\n And that was me.\n\n2:01:17.400 --> 2:01:19.000\n Who was the Joe Pesci in your life?\n\n2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:19.840\n Well, there was a guy named,\n\n2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:22.520\n there was a James Woods for sure, who was the Lester.\n\n2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:24.800\n We called him, we actually called him Lester.\n\n2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:26.600\n A few of my friends call him Lester.\n\n2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:31.360\n The greasy guy who tried to get back in and all that.\n\n2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:32.200\n But yeah.\n\n2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:33.040\n Yeah, one of my favorite scenes\n\n2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:35.240\n is when they meet out in the desert\n\n2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:36.600\n and it's like a 50, 50 odds\n\n2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:38.360\n if you're gonna make it out alive in that.\n\n2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:43.360\n I mean, yeah, there's an epicness to that portrayal of Vegas.\n\n2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:45.400\n I love, I mean, it's just totally,\n\n2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:46.760\n I mean, it's obviously more corporate now\n\n2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:49.440\n and it's different, but I love those movies.\n\n2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:51.440\n I love all those movies, just seeing that life.\n\n2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:53.080\n And like I said, if there was a period in time\n\n2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:55.360\n that I could go back to and just experience it,\n\n2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:56.760\n it would be that, you know, right around then.\n\n2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:00.180\n There'll be that, playing with a mob and not.\n\n2:02:00.180 --> 2:02:01.960\n I think of like these crime shows today,\n\n2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:04.000\n like they're so unrealistic now\n\n2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.620\n because if they're in an era that is now,\n\n2:02:06.620 --> 2:02:08.240\n like none of this stuff can happen\n\n2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:09.660\n because there's cameras everywhere.\n\n2:02:09.660 --> 2:02:11.000\n You can't like get away with these,\n\n2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.640\n like killing somebody and jumping in a car\n\n2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:15.840\n and you're gonna get caught, you know?\n\n2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:18.200\n But in the 70s, you know, that stuff happened.\n\n2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:19.600\n Across the line, you die.\n\n2:02:19.600 --> 2:02:22.800\n Yeah, Lake Mead is recently like losing water\n\n2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:24.240\n and like every couple of days\n\n2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:26.720\n they're finding more and more bodies from that era.\n\n2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:27.560\n Oh no.\n\n2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:28.400\n They really are.\n\n2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:30.840\n You're close with your mom.\n\n2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:33.280\n What did you learn about life from your mom?\n\n2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:35.000\n My mother was very generous.\n\n2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:39.920\n My mother, she experienced joy through giving people food.\n\n2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:42.080\n For the most part, my dad would get them drinks\n\n2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:45.600\n and that was how she felt fulfilled, right?\n\n2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:47.440\n She felt good when she like would cook for you.\n\n2:02:47.440 --> 2:02:49.400\n And like, she'd be that person you'd come over\n\n2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:50.760\n and she'd be like, are you hungry?\n\n2:02:50.760 --> 2:02:51.960\n And you say, no, no, no, I'm okay.\n\n2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:54.760\n She's gonna put 15 things in front of you and you'll eat.\n\n2:02:54.760 --> 2:02:55.600\n You know, you're gonna eat.\n\n2:02:55.600 --> 2:02:56.840\n Cause everyone does that to be polite.\n\n2:02:56.840 --> 2:02:57.760\n No, no, I'm good.\n\n2:02:57.760 --> 2:02:59.520\n But you know, they will start to eat.\n\n2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:01.520\n And just her hospitality in that regard\n\n2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:04.440\n and just being generous and like being a good host\n\n2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:06.320\n to people and things like that, like.\n\n2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:10.560\n How did that define, like help define who you are\n\n2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:13.040\n as a person, that generosity?\n\n2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:14.520\n Did it rub off on you?\n\n2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:17.440\n It made me think about in my life\n\n2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:21.520\n when it comes to like any sort of business deals\n\n2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:23.920\n or things like that, I don't wanna get the best of it\n\n2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:25.600\n in such a way where I screw the other person.\n\n2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:26.920\n I genuinely don't.\n\n2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:29.400\n I'd much rather you owe me than me owe you.\n\n2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:32.160\n So if I hire people, they get paid more\n\n2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:33.160\n than they're supposed to.\n\n2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:36.040\n And I'd rather them do that and work towards it\n\n2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:37.200\n rather than feel underpaid.\n\n2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:39.480\n Cause if they're underpaid, they'll likely under deliver.\n\n2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:41.160\n Whereas if they feel overpaid,\n\n2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:43.280\n then if I need them to do something special,\n\n2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:45.240\n they're not gonna be like, hey, I don't get paid for that.\n\n2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:46.720\n Like, yeah, you do.\n\n2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:47.560\n You really do.\n\n2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:49.840\n So that's certainly like played out in my life\n\n2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:53.080\n where I set it up in such a way where I don't owe,\n\n2:03:53.080 --> 2:03:56.080\n you know, I'm owed, but that's okay.\n\n2:03:56.080 --> 2:03:58.600\n Cause I can handle taking the worst of it in spots.\n\n2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:01.840\n I don't like being the person to, you know,\n\n2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:03.440\n feel like I'm indebted to others.\n\n2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:06.840\n Yeah, in some way, the karma of that tends\n\n2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:09.360\n to pay dividends in the longterm.\n\n2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:14.360\n Somehow there's somebody up there\n\n2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:17.560\n that's keeping track in some kind of way.\n\n2:04:17.560 --> 2:04:20.440\n What advice would you give to young people today\n\n2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:22.240\n in high school and college?\n\n2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:25.200\n How to have a career they can be proud of\n\n2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:27.300\n or maybe how to have a life in general\n\n2:04:27.300 --> 2:04:28.900\n they can be proud of?\n\n2:04:28.900 --> 2:04:32.080\n I would say like your 20s is a good opportunity\n\n2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:34.880\n to set yourself up for the rest of your life, right?\n\n2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:38.140\n So while the 20s are a period where you wanna have fun\n\n2:04:38.140 --> 2:04:40.440\n and you wanna experience youth,\n\n2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:42.400\n it's also a good opportunity to start thinking about\n\n2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:44.840\n what do you want your life to look like\n\n2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:46.840\n in your 30s and your 40s, right?\n\n2:04:46.840 --> 2:04:48.660\n So I feel like it's the best time\n\n2:04:48.660 --> 2:04:51.200\n to really put yourself out there and take risks\n\n2:04:51.200 --> 2:04:53.760\n and try to hit it, you know, whatever,\n\n2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:55.380\n you know, like to work really, really hard\n\n2:04:55.380 --> 2:04:56.400\n to set yourself up.\n\n2:04:56.400 --> 2:04:59.880\n Because, and I said this at an event I was speaking at,\n\n2:04:59.880 --> 2:05:01.040\n when you're like with poker,\n\n2:05:01.040 --> 2:05:02.480\n when your bankroll is very, very small,\n\n2:05:02.480 --> 2:05:05.120\n it's replenishable, right?\n\n2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:06.960\n You don't need to protect it as much\n\n2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:09.360\n as you do once you've got something, right?\n\n2:05:09.360 --> 2:05:11.200\n Once you have a brand or you have money,\n\n2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:12.560\n you have something like that,\n\n2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:14.040\n that's when you wanna start protecting you.\n\n2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:15.580\n But in your 20s is an opportunity\n\n2:05:15.580 --> 2:05:18.120\n to just really sort of get, you know,\n\n2:05:18.120 --> 2:05:21.260\n to work really, really hard to set yourself up,\n\n2:05:21.260 --> 2:05:22.100\n you know, for the future.\n\n2:05:22.100 --> 2:05:23.280\n I am concerned a little bit,\n\n2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:24.600\n like every time I talk to kids today,\n\n2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:26.080\n I'm like, what do you wanna be?\n\n2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:30.160\n They all wanna be YouTubers or Instagram stars or rappers,\n\n2:05:30.160 --> 2:05:31.000\n right?\n\n2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:32.480\n Like, okay, I was like, that's cool,\n\n2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:33.880\n but like, there's only so many of those,\n\n2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:35.360\n you know, that there can be.\n\n2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:36.520\n So it might be worthwhile having\n\n2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:38.000\n a little bit of a backup plan.\n\n2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.600\n I think it's easier to be successful on Instagram\n\n2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:43.160\n and social media if you do something else.\n\n2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:44.680\n And I would say this too.\n\n2:05:44.680 --> 2:05:46.960\n One other thing I would say is,\n\n2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:49.640\n don't choose a profession or an idea\n\n2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:54.000\n because you think it'll make you rich, right?\n\n2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.560\n Pursue something that you actually love.\n\n2:05:56.560 --> 2:05:57.700\n Because if you love it,\n\n2:05:57.700 --> 2:05:59.560\n you're way more likely to become rich.\n\n2:05:59.560 --> 2:06:02.960\n If you don't, you do something that you don't actually enjoy.\n\n2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:05.440\n Now you're spending a lot of your life unhappy,\n\n2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:06.680\n doing something you don't want,\n\n2:06:06.680 --> 2:06:08.760\n and if you're not passionate about it,\n\n2:06:08.760 --> 2:06:09.600\n you're probably not,\n\n2:06:09.600 --> 2:06:12.240\n the chances of you being successful are much lower.\n\n2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:14.000\n And also becoming rich,\n\n2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:15.760\n and I've talked to a lot of rich people,\n\n2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:17.400\n hang out with a lot of rich people,\n\n2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:21.440\n is not going to be as fulfilling as you imagine.\n\n2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:23.600\n If you arrive there by not doing the thing\n\n2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:24.720\n that you love doing.\n\n2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:25.560\n That's true.\n\n2:06:25.560 --> 2:06:28.800\n Ultimately, the thing that you love doing is like,\n\n2:06:28.800 --> 2:06:30.320\n that's what makes life worth it.\n\n2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:32.240\n There's another quote, I can't remember who it was,\n\n2:06:32.240 --> 2:06:33.080\n otherwise I would quote them,\n\n2:06:33.080 --> 2:06:35.480\n but it says something to the effect of like,\n\n2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.640\n if we believe in the lie that more is always better,\n\n2:06:39.640 --> 2:06:41.640\n then we can never truly arrive.\n\n2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:44.480\n Because wherever we are, more is better, right?\n\n2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:45.640\n I've never understood,\n\n2:06:45.640 --> 2:06:46.680\n and I've been around rich people,\n\n2:06:46.680 --> 2:06:48.320\n like you said, you know, the bill,\n\n2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:50.320\n I never got, I can't, I don't get it.\n\n2:06:50.320 --> 2:06:51.920\n Like, if you have a billion dollars,\n\n2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:54.680\n why do you give a shit about money at all?\n\n2:06:54.680 --> 2:06:56.680\n Like, and they're still like, oh, we made this deal,\n\n2:06:56.680 --> 2:06:58.720\n and I'm like, you know, we picked up 300,\n\n2:06:58.720 --> 2:06:59.560\n who cares?\n\n2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:00.440\n Like, your life is set.\n\n2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:03.040\n Like, there is that bell curve, right?\n\n2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:05.200\n Where obviously being in poverty, you know,\n\n2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:07.320\n there's obviously a high rate of unhappiness,\n\n2:07:07.320 --> 2:07:09.600\n but there's a certain amount of money where you reach,\n\n2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:10.960\n you know, where you reach a level of happiness,\n\n2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:13.280\n and then too much, you find the people\n\n2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:15.400\n that are searching for money to fulfill these holes,\n\n2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:17.480\n it starts to go back down again.\n\n2:07:17.480 --> 2:07:21.520\n Well, the getting more money could become a game,\n\n2:07:21.520 --> 2:07:23.520\n like a sport, that's fun to play,\n\n2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:27.320\n as long as you directly or indirectly acknowledge\n\n2:07:27.320 --> 2:07:29.520\n that what you love is the game of it,\n\n2:07:29.520 --> 2:07:31.000\n versus the actual attainment of money.\n\n2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:32.600\n And I think that's what it is, right?\n\n2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:34.600\n For me, I've never cared about money that much.\n\n2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:37.280\n I just never did, otherwise I would have a lot more of it.\n\n2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:40.040\n But it's always, like, it's always been strange to me\n\n2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:42.160\n how people that have that kind of money,\n\n2:07:42.160 --> 2:07:45.760\n like, are cheap in any way, you know?\n\n2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:48.880\n Like, they wouldn't donate 5,000 to a worthwhile charity,\n\n2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:50.560\n because it's like, buddy, this,\n\n2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:52.720\n like, when it changes your life, not,\n\n2:07:52.720 --> 2:07:55.440\n I don't even like, like, small things, like taxes.\n\n2:07:55.440 --> 2:07:57.400\n Like, okay, you have $20 billion,\n\n2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:00.640\n and you're worried about paying 33%, 30% to 31.\n\n2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:03.480\n I get it, I get the point of it all,\n\n2:08:03.480 --> 2:08:06.880\n but like, it literally has no effect on your life whatsoever.\n\n2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:10.200\n Your life is unchanged, whether it's 31 or 33.\n\n2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:12.840\n Yeah, that's the negative of a lot of money,\n\n2:08:12.840 --> 2:08:14.800\n is if it corrupts the way you see the world,\n\n2:08:14.800 --> 2:08:16.520\n you start to be protective and so on.\n\n2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:19.240\n I mean, part of the challenge of when you get a lot of money\n\n2:08:19.240 --> 2:08:21.200\n is people start to treat you differently,\n\n2:08:21.200 --> 2:08:24.760\n and so navigating that correctly is very challenging.\n\n2:08:24.760 --> 2:08:29.760\n So don't change, remain the same person you always were,\n\n2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:32.000\n because if you change, you start to,\n\n2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:33.720\n I mean, that's why power corrupts,\n\n2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:36.000\n is you get a lot of power, you get a lot of fame,\n\n2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:40.120\n you get a lot of money, you start to distrust people,\n\n2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:41.840\n and you start to push away people\n\n2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:43.680\n that are actually really close to you with trusting.\n\n2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:45.400\n And you also, I think, you develop some biases\n\n2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:47.040\n where you think, like, you're just this,\n\n2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:49.360\n you know, you think, like, it was all you,\n\n2:08:49.360 --> 2:08:51.000\n and you're a genius, and you're so great,\n\n2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:52.440\n and all these other people who don't have,\n\n2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:54.040\n it's just because they don't have what you have,\n\n2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:57.080\n and then you start to view that group of people,\n\n2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:00.280\n whether they're impoverished or whatever is less than,\n\n2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:01.640\n and that you're some great guru\n\n2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:04.080\n where you could have just got lucky and bought Bitcoins\n\n2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:05.520\n that you could have done anything,\n\n2:09:05.520 --> 2:09:07.520\n and then you became super wealthy,\n\n2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:10.160\n and then you have this Dunning Kruger effect,\n\n2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:11.800\n where you think you know everything about everything.\n\n2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:13.000\n And a lot of poker people have that,\n\n2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:16.080\n and listen, I'm probably guilty in some ways too,\n\n2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:17.640\n thinking because you can figure out poker\n\n2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:20.200\n and be great at that, that you could figure out anything.\n\n2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:21.440\n So it's true, right?\n\n2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:24.160\n I mean, we sort of, we genuinely feel like\n\n2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:25.640\n people that reach the highest levels of poker\n\n2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:27.200\n feel like they are intelligent.\n\n2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:28.440\n So they will look at problem solving\n\n2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:30.120\n and think that they have answers.\n\n2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:32.840\n Well, you have to remind yourself that you're not.\n\n2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:35.480\n It's best to see the world as you did just get lucky,\n\n2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:37.080\n or at least from my perspective,\n\n2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:38.400\n that you're not better than anybody.\n\n2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:39.640\n I don't think there's anything wrong with, like,\n\n2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:42.000\n acknowledging that you worked hard to get where you were.\n\n2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.320\n Like, there isn't, but at the same time, like,\n\n2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:46.160\n it's not available to everybody in the same way.\n\n2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:47.440\n You know, right time, right place.\n\n2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:48.600\n Like, for me, my poker career\n\n2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:50.520\n could have gone very differently, you know?\n\n2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:52.320\n If things didn't work out, you know,\n\n2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:54.400\n if I had some bad luck in the wrong times,\n\n2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:56.080\n like, who knows where I'd be?\n\n2:09:56.080 --> 2:09:59.840\n So you said your brain crawl is pretty small in your 20s.\n\n2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:01.840\n I'm sure you've been around a lot of people\n\n2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:04.720\n you care a lot about who've lost everything in poker.\n\n2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:05.960\n What's that like?\n\n2:10:05.960 --> 2:10:09.280\n What's those low points of losing everything?\n\n2:10:09.280 --> 2:10:12.040\n I think because I've been there,\n\n2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:15.600\n I have more empathy than I probably should for those people.\n\n2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:16.480\n I really feel for them.\n\n2:10:16.480 --> 2:10:18.960\n Cause I remember being in Vegas and being totally broke\n\n2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:21.720\n and like a guy loaning me $400\n\n2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:24.840\n and me like turning that 400 into 20,000, 400 bucks.\n\n2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:27.360\n And it was like eternally grateful to that.\n\n2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:29.520\n So when I have friends who go through that,\n\n2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:31.000\n like I always try to consult them,\n\n2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:34.680\n obviously what they really need is money for the most part.\n\n2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:36.440\n But I remember saying no to one friend\n\n2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:37.720\n because he didn't have a plan.\n\n2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:39.800\n So I like to try to help them in that regard.\n\n2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:42.240\n Like my buddy's like, can you stake me in this game?\n\n2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:43.880\n And I was like, all right, well, how much do you,\n\n2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:45.720\n then I was like, let's break down the math, bro.\n\n2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:46.560\n You want me to stake you?\n\n2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:48.720\n So you get 50% of the profit, right?\n\n2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:50.440\n So I said, how much do you think you can make in this game?\n\n2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:52.200\n How much does the biggest winners make?\n\n2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:53.640\n It's like, well, I can probably, you know,\n\n2:10:53.640 --> 2:10:56.280\n I probably do like 20,000 a month in this game.\n\n2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:57.120\n So, okay.\n\n2:10:57.120 --> 2:10:58.960\n So you get half of that cause I get 10, right?\n\n2:10:58.960 --> 2:10:59.900\n What is your monthly nut?\n\n2:10:59.900 --> 2:11:00.740\n How much are you spending?\n\n2:11:00.740 --> 2:11:03.400\n It's like, well, I'm renting this thing for 8,000.\n\n2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:05.920\n You're spending 17,000 a month.\n\n2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:09.480\n So like, no matter what you're set up to fail.\n\n2:11:09.480 --> 2:11:10.900\n Like this isn't going to work.\n\n2:11:10.900 --> 2:11:12.160\n So I actually didn't give him the money.\n\n2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:13.940\n And I was like, what you need to do to earn more money\n\n2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:16.120\n is lower your monthly nut because it's too high.\n\n2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:19.160\n It just, you know, it just doesn't mathematically add up.\n\n2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:21.500\n So trying to set them right in that regard\n\n2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:24.680\n is something that like I feel obliged to do,\n\n2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:25.520\n especially if they're friends.\n\n2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:27.600\n But what about the mental aspect of the struggle\n\n2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:30.040\n they're going through, the struggle you were going through?\n\n2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:34.400\n Just, I mean, it's really rough to have no money.\n\n2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:35.520\n It's not for everybody.\n\n2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:36.360\n This really isn't.\n\n2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:37.720\n Like a lot of people might, you know, listen to this\n\n2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:38.800\n and think like, oh, I want to play poker.\n\n2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:40.580\n It's like, most people fail.\n\n2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:43.920\n Most people who want to play in the NFL,\n\n2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:46.320\n they spend their college years,\n\n2:11:46.320 --> 2:11:48.520\n like most of them are not going to make it.\n\n2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:50.440\n Most of you who try to play poker professionally\n\n2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:52.900\n are going to fail and you're going to experience despair.\n\n2:11:52.900 --> 2:11:53.800\n Okay?\n\n2:11:53.800 --> 2:11:56.160\n There are those like in anything that have the passion,\n\n2:11:56.160 --> 2:11:58.280\n have the knowhow, have the luck and all that sort of stuff.\n\n2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:01.640\n And it all pans out, but you know, they're the minority.\n\n2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:06.440\n And so for the low points, if you remember,\n\n2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:08.720\n what does it take to sort of overcome that,\n\n2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:12.300\n overcome the mental struggle?\n\n2:12:12.300 --> 2:12:13.800\n I mean, you're making it sound like certain people\n\n2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:15.520\n are just genetically able to in certain.\n\n2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:18.240\n I do think some people are more apt to being able to deal\n\n2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:20.040\n with like adversity and having resilience\n\n2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:21.600\n and some people just can't hack it.\n\n2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:23.360\n But like I generally, what I would advise,\n\n2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:24.760\n you know, people that are, let's say a guy's playing,\n\n2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:26.480\n you know, really high stakes or whatever,\n\n2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:29.140\n doing badly is step number one is take,\n\n2:12:29.140 --> 2:12:30.520\n take a little bit of a break here.\n\n2:12:30.520 --> 2:12:33.760\n Let's recalibrate and let's start small again.\n\n2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:35.040\n Let's, you know, let's restart\n\n2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:36.140\n and let's play smaller stakes\n\n2:12:36.140 --> 2:12:39.120\n and let's get our confidence back because in poker,\n\n2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:41.660\n without confidence, you cannot be successful.\n\n2:12:41.660 --> 2:12:45.120\n It is incredibly important to have almost an inflated level\n\n2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:46.880\n of confidence in yourself\n\n2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:48.800\n because you're up against it, right?\n\n2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:50.460\n As I said, the majority of people fail.\n\n2:12:50.460 --> 2:12:51.520\n So why are you special?\n\n2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:52.560\n Why are you different?\n\n2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:54.240\n You have to be pretty confident about your, you know,\n\n2:12:54.240 --> 2:12:57.560\n yourself to think that you are one of the chosen ones.\n\n2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:01.680\n And then don't resist the despair and take a nap.\n\n2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:03.800\n Definitely take a nap.\n\n2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:05.080\n Listen, it's okay to experience it.\n\n2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:06.800\n Like I said, yeah, you're going to experience despair.\n\n2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:09.280\n What else would you, what should you be feeling?\n\n2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:10.440\n You know, if things are going poorly\n\n2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:12.840\n and you've just lost all your money, excited?\n\n2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:15.880\n Maybe like, okay, have your moment of grief,\n\n2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:18.360\n allow yourself to experience it so that you can,\n\n2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:20.560\n you know, reassemble.\n\n2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:21.800\n There's a fundamental way\n\n2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:23.720\n in which you haven't really lived life\n\n2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:27.200\n if you haven't experienced periods of despair.\n\n2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:30.080\n You have a jaded view of the world, right?\n\n2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:31.880\n Weird thing about the human condition\n\n2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:35.280\n that both the highs and the lows are important.\n\n2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:36.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:40.740\n What role does love play in the human condition,\n\n2:13:40.740 --> 2:13:42.220\n Daniel Negrano?\n\n2:13:42.220 --> 2:13:43.660\n That's a good one.\n\n2:13:43.660 --> 2:13:47.020\n What role has love played in your life?\n\n2:13:47.020 --> 2:13:48.700\n It's, yeah, that's, you know,\n\n2:13:48.700 --> 2:13:50.980\n you sort of talked about the ups and downs\n\n2:13:50.980 --> 2:13:55.980\n of the human condition and love has been that for me, right?\n\n2:13:58.500 --> 2:14:00.520\n Like I'm in a good place now,\n\n2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:04.580\n but you know, even with my now wife years ago,\n\n2:14:04.580 --> 2:14:07.900\n you know, she was young, she was, you know, new to poker\n\n2:14:07.900 --> 2:14:09.240\n and she wasn't ready to settle down.\n\n2:14:09.240 --> 2:14:12.460\n I was like, when I met her, I think I was 31, she was 21.\n\n2:14:12.460 --> 2:14:15.620\n And I was ready to like lock her up, if you will, you know,\n\n2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:16.460\n let's do this.\n\n2:14:16.460 --> 2:14:18.420\n And I bought a ring way back when she was like,\n\n2:14:18.420 --> 2:14:19.260\n not about that.\n\n2:14:19.260 --> 2:14:20.940\n She was living the Hollywood life.\n\n2:14:20.940 --> 2:14:22.300\n She was living, you know, partying in LA,\n\n2:14:22.300 --> 2:14:23.900\n doing that kind of stuff and wasn't ready.\n\n2:14:23.900 --> 2:14:27.220\n And we split and that one hit me hard.\n\n2:14:27.220 --> 2:14:31.120\n So I didn't realize how much of a hit\n\n2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:35.220\n that had on my confidence in my, in everything really,\n\n2:14:35.220 --> 2:14:36.600\n in poker, with other women.\n\n2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:39.660\n It had me a little jaded about women too, you know,\n\n2:14:39.660 --> 2:14:43.300\n resentful, you know, and it took a lot of like self,\n\n2:14:43.300 --> 2:14:45.780\n I did like a lot of personal growth work\n\n2:14:45.780 --> 2:14:47.700\n and workshops and things like that.\n\n2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:49.860\n And then didn't see her for years.\n\n2:14:49.860 --> 2:14:51.780\n And she came back to town, I was a much different person.\n\n2:14:51.780 --> 2:14:54.140\n It was just, you know, four years ago or something like that.\n\n2:14:54.140 --> 2:14:56.740\n And she was too, went to dinner.\n\n2:14:56.740 --> 2:14:58.740\n A few months later, we were married.\n\n2:14:58.740 --> 2:15:01.460\n It worked out so different because we both had to grow,\n\n2:15:01.460 --> 2:15:03.700\n you know, and become different people.\n\n2:15:03.700 --> 2:15:05.500\n And that love was still there somehow.\n\n2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:07.540\n Yeah, like she went through her relationships.\n\n2:15:07.540 --> 2:15:09.940\n I went through mine, you know, we experienced life\n\n2:15:09.940 --> 2:15:12.900\n and I was married once before too, you know,\n\n2:15:12.900 --> 2:15:14.860\n called my starter marriage, if you will,\n\n2:15:16.020 --> 2:15:19.020\n which yeah, you know, we just, you don't know.\n\n2:15:19.020 --> 2:15:21.180\n I think like until you do it, until you get married\n\n2:15:21.180 --> 2:15:23.580\n and you know, experience like the sacrifice,\n\n2:15:23.580 --> 2:15:25.760\n not necessarily the sacrifices, but your value systems,\n\n2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:27.060\n if they don't align identically,\n\n2:15:27.060 --> 2:15:30.220\n which they're not going to, someone like me,\n\n2:15:30.220 --> 2:15:32.860\n probably one of my strengths in poker,\n\n2:15:32.860 --> 2:15:36.120\n but my weaknesses in relationship is judgment, right?\n\n2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:37.940\n When I play poker, I need to judge you.\n\n2:15:37.940 --> 2:15:39.340\n That's essentially what I'm doing.\n\n2:15:39.340 --> 2:15:42.020\n I'm gauging who you are and what you're good at\n\n2:15:42.020 --> 2:15:43.180\n and what you're bad at.\n\n2:15:43.180 --> 2:15:45.180\n And that can have repercussions because it leads,\n\n2:15:45.180 --> 2:15:48.620\n that's how I view, that's the lens I look at everyone with\n\n2:15:48.620 --> 2:15:49.680\n based on how you live your life.\n\n2:15:49.680 --> 2:15:51.360\n I'm judging you, this guy's this, this guy's that,\n\n2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:53.300\n this guy's that, and that's not healthy.\n\n2:15:53.300 --> 2:15:54.780\n So you have to shut that off.\n\n2:15:54.780 --> 2:15:56.740\n You have to learn to like, and the thing,\n\n2:15:56.740 --> 2:15:59.500\n I finally realized what love is, frankly for me,\n\n2:15:59.500 --> 2:16:02.260\n with her is no judgment, right?\n\n2:16:02.260 --> 2:16:04.900\n She's so like, yeah, so I have my way of being, right?\n\n2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:06.980\n If she wants to have cereal for dinner,\n\n2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:08.580\n babe, that's the best decision for her.\n\n2:16:08.580 --> 2:16:11.260\n I was living in a framework of better and worse.\n\n2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:13.940\n The way that I do things is better and yours is worse,\n\n2:16:13.940 --> 2:16:15.580\n do things more like I do.\n\n2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:17.420\n That's a recipe for disaster.\n\n2:16:17.420 --> 2:16:19.860\n True acceptance and true love is accepting someone\n\n2:16:19.860 --> 2:16:21.460\n like exactly as they are.\n\n2:16:21.460 --> 2:16:23.180\n You know, if she wants to do something different,\n\n2:16:23.180 --> 2:16:25.060\n I'm going to support her, whatever it is.\n\n2:16:25.060 --> 2:16:26.700\n Even if I disagree with it personally,\n\n2:16:26.700 --> 2:16:28.600\n and like the way that I would do things,\n\n2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:31.460\n learning to just realize that she's had a different journey\n\n2:16:31.460 --> 2:16:34.340\n and a different walk towards where she's at than I have.\n\n2:16:34.340 --> 2:16:37.540\n So I can't pass my judgments on other people like that.\n\n2:16:37.540 --> 2:16:39.380\n I believe it is ethically wrong\n\n2:16:39.380 --> 2:16:42.020\n and probably illegal to eat cereal for dinner.\n\n2:16:43.540 --> 2:16:45.700\n Listen, if she wants it, she wants it.\n\n2:16:45.700 --> 2:16:46.860\n Acceptance.\n\n2:16:46.860 --> 2:16:49.100\n Like when she goes to bed, like all these little things,\n\n2:16:49.100 --> 2:16:50.860\n but my regimented life, she's not.\n\n2:16:50.860 --> 2:16:53.780\n Like our motto at our wedding was like,\n\n2:16:53.780 --> 2:16:56.700\n you keep me wild, I'll keep you safe, you keep me wild.\n\n2:16:56.700 --> 2:16:59.020\n I keep her safe, she keeps me wild.\n\n2:16:59.020 --> 2:17:01.620\n She's like not organized and anal and all those kind\n\n2:17:01.620 --> 2:17:02.940\n of things, I am.\n\n2:17:02.940 --> 2:17:06.160\n She helps me like let loose.\n\n2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:07.580\n You know, oh no, I'm eating this, this.\n\n2:17:07.580 --> 2:17:09.020\n She's like, have some popcorn.\n\n2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:10.700\n Like, all right, let's do it, you know?\n\n2:17:10.700 --> 2:17:12.540\n She keeps me freed.\n\n2:17:12.540 --> 2:17:14.780\n And accepting that, embracing that,\n\n2:17:14.780 --> 2:17:17.720\n the difference is the chaos of it.\n\n2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:18.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:19.380\n That's what makes it.\n\n2:17:19.380 --> 2:17:21.100\n Like I literally do think about with her,\n\n2:17:21.100 --> 2:17:25.360\n how important it is and how much I try to like just come\n\n2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:28.260\n from neutral and like compassion and never judge.\n\n2:17:28.260 --> 2:17:30.380\n Cause she's got other things that she deals with, right?\n\n2:17:30.380 --> 2:17:32.940\n That I don't, she's bipolar, right?\n\n2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:35.860\n So with that, I've studied and I've learned a lot about,\n\n2:17:35.860 --> 2:17:37.860\n you know, sort of mental health and what that means\n\n2:17:37.860 --> 2:17:42.860\n and ways in which a lot of characteristics\n\n2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:45.740\n about somebody is completely out of their control\n\n2:17:45.740 --> 2:17:47.380\n when they're bipolar, right?\n\n2:17:47.380 --> 2:17:51.260\n And there's swings, like there's no cocktail\n\n2:17:51.260 --> 2:17:53.820\n for bipolar that solves the issue, right?\n\n2:17:53.820 --> 2:17:55.740\n So there's medications that work to, you know,\n\n2:17:55.740 --> 2:17:57.660\n level you out for periods of time,\n\n2:17:57.660 --> 2:17:59.540\n but then they start to fade and they don't work as well.\n\n2:17:59.540 --> 2:18:01.540\n So they constantly need readjustment.\n\n2:18:01.540 --> 2:18:04.020\n It's an unsolved mystery to a certain degree.\n\n2:18:04.020 --> 2:18:07.220\n So in some sense, you know,\n\n2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:11.180\n her diagnosis made our relationship easier\n\n2:18:11.180 --> 2:18:13.540\n because I don't take anything personal, right?\n\n2:18:13.540 --> 2:18:16.140\n I realized that sometimes she's gonna be in a mood.\n\n2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:19.740\n I mean, she's so good about communicating it though.\n\n2:18:19.740 --> 2:18:22.020\n She tells me some morning she'll be like bad mood\n\n2:18:22.020 --> 2:18:22.860\n trying to get out of it, babe.\n\n2:18:22.860 --> 2:18:24.780\n I'm like, okay, I leave her alone.\n\n2:18:24.780 --> 2:18:25.620\n Well, that's great.\n\n2:18:25.620 --> 2:18:27.620\n That means she's grown to be able to communicate,\n\n2:18:27.620 --> 2:18:29.940\n to understand, to self reflect, to understand where she is.\n\n2:18:29.940 --> 2:18:32.900\n I have people in my life who I love who are bipolar.\n\n2:18:32.900 --> 2:18:34.060\n It's a beautiful ride.\n\n2:18:34.060 --> 2:18:35.100\n It is, right?\n\n2:18:35.100 --> 2:18:38.780\n Yeah, it's, yeah, the highs and the lows are there.\n\n2:18:38.780 --> 2:18:41.540\n So, but yeah, like, because I feel like a protector.\n\n2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:44.380\n For me, I just want to be a rock, right?\n\n2:18:44.380 --> 2:18:45.900\n And that's part of the whole serial thing.\n\n2:18:45.900 --> 2:18:47.780\n If she wants to eat cereal,\n\n2:18:47.780 --> 2:18:50.540\n don't make a wrong for anything she wants to do.\n\n2:18:50.540 --> 2:18:52.100\n What have you learned from life\n\n2:18:52.100 --> 2:18:55.660\n from the song, The Gambler by Kenny Rogers?\n\n2:18:55.660 --> 2:18:57.140\n You got to know when to hold them,\n\n2:18:57.140 --> 2:18:58.700\n know when to fold them,\n\n2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:01.540\n know when to walk away, know when to run.\n\n2:19:01.540 --> 2:19:04.100\n You never count your money when you're sitting at the table.\n\n2:19:04.100 --> 2:19:05.580\n There'll be plenty of time for counting\n\n2:19:05.580 --> 2:19:06.820\n when the dealing's done.\n\n2:19:06.820 --> 2:19:08.900\n Is that, do you live by those words or?\n\n2:19:08.900 --> 2:19:10.820\n The first part of it for sure.\n\n2:19:10.820 --> 2:19:11.980\n What do they even mean?\n\n2:19:11.980 --> 2:19:12.820\n Cause.\n\n2:19:12.820 --> 2:19:15.340\n You got to know when to hold, know when.\n\n2:19:15.340 --> 2:19:17.540\n So basically it's like, all right, you know, in life,\n\n2:19:17.540 --> 2:19:20.220\n like, you know, let's say, let's use a, whatever,\n\n2:19:20.220 --> 2:19:23.100\n the market, for example, you bought a stock, right?\n\n2:19:23.100 --> 2:19:24.260\n Or you bought Bitcoin and you're like,\n\n2:19:24.260 --> 2:19:26.340\n it's going to go to the moon, right?\n\n2:19:26.340 --> 2:19:29.540\n It's like, okay, well, maybe things have changed.\n\n2:19:29.540 --> 2:19:32.460\n New scenario, new circumstances, new situation.\n\n2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:34.780\n Are you going down with the ship, right?\n\n2:19:34.780 --> 2:19:36.060\n Or are you going to lay the hand down?\n\n2:19:36.060 --> 2:19:37.060\n Are you going to fold it?\n\n2:19:37.060 --> 2:19:38.700\n Whether it's a relationship, you know,\n\n2:19:38.700 --> 2:19:41.100\n you're with this woman, you're like, all right,\n\n2:19:41.100 --> 2:19:43.020\n I think it's time to fold this one.\n\n2:19:43.020 --> 2:19:44.060\n I think, you know,\n\n2:19:44.060 --> 2:19:46.260\n I don't think that we're going to be able to make this,\n\n2:19:46.260 --> 2:19:47.700\n this hand work right now.\n\n2:19:47.700 --> 2:19:49.700\n When to fold them and when to run.\n\n2:19:49.700 --> 2:19:50.540\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:50.540 --> 2:19:54.100\n So maybe every gambler knows that the secret to surviving\n\n2:19:54.100 --> 2:19:56.780\n is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep\n\n2:19:56.780 --> 2:19:59.660\n because every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser.\n\n2:19:59.660 --> 2:20:01.100\n That's like a stoic philosophy.\n\n2:20:01.100 --> 2:20:04.940\n And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.\n\n2:20:06.060 --> 2:20:09.220\n Every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser.\n\n2:20:09.220 --> 2:20:10.340\n What does that mean?\n\n2:20:10.340 --> 2:20:11.180\n I like that one.\n\n2:20:11.180 --> 2:20:13.500\n I like, for me, that's like the difference between victim\n\n2:20:13.500 --> 2:20:16.100\n and responsible, like the way that I think about it, right?\n\n2:20:16.100 --> 2:20:18.100\n You can be a victim to circumstance\n\n2:20:18.100 --> 2:20:20.380\n or you can be responsible for everything in your life, right?\n\n2:20:20.380 --> 2:20:22.020\n So when an event happens,\n\n2:20:22.020 --> 2:20:24.820\n the event itself is neither good or bad\n\n2:20:24.820 --> 2:20:27.380\n until you assign it value, right?\n\n2:20:27.380 --> 2:20:30.740\n So like an event happens and it can be traumatic,\n\n2:20:30.740 --> 2:20:31.980\n it can be, you know, painful,\n\n2:20:31.980 --> 2:20:33.820\n but you know, how you respond to it\n\n2:20:33.820 --> 2:20:35.500\n is ultimately going to be up to you.\n\n2:20:35.500 --> 2:20:36.740\n Like you actually do have a choice.\n\n2:20:36.740 --> 2:20:38.940\n And that's the thing you can control.\n\n2:20:38.940 --> 2:20:42.500\n The fact that you, Daniel Negrano took my commentary\n\n2:20:42.500 --> 2:20:44.860\n about The Gambler seriously shows once more\n\n2:20:44.860 --> 2:20:47.060\n that you're a beautiful human being.\n\n2:20:47.060 --> 2:20:49.300\n Thank you so much for being who you are,\n\n2:20:49.300 --> 2:20:51.740\n for inspiring millions of people about poker,\n\n2:20:51.740 --> 2:20:53.020\n about how to live life.\n\n2:20:53.020 --> 2:20:55.340\n And thank you for giving me your valuable time today.\n\n2:20:55.340 --> 2:20:56.180\n This is amazing.\n\n2:20:56.180 --> 2:20:57.020\n Thanks for talking.\n\n2:20:57.020 --> 2:20:57.860\n It was fun, man.\n\n2:20:57.860 --> 2:20:59.740\n It was great to have the conversation.\n\n2:20:59.740 --> 2:21:01.220\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:21:01.220 --> 2:21:02.420\n with Daniel Negrano.\n\n2:21:02.420 --> 2:21:03.540\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:06.140\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:21:06.140 --> 2:21:09.100\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:21:09.100 --> 2:21:11.380\n from Doyle Brunson.\n\n2:21:11.380 --> 2:21:13.580\n Poker is war.\n\n2:21:13.580 --> 2:21:15.540\n People pretend it is a game.\n\n2:21:15.540 --> 2:21:40.540\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
