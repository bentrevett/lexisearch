00:08.900\n and an author who masterfully reveals the beauty\n\n00:08.900 --> 00:12.180\n and power of mathematics in his 2014 book,\n\n00:12.180 --> 00:15.000\n How Not To Be Wrong, and his new book,\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:17.540\n just released recently, called Shape,\n\n00:17.540 --> 00:20.440\n The Hidden Geometry of Information, Biology,\n\n00:20.440 --> 00:23.400\n Strategy, Democracy, and Everything Else.\n\n00:23.400 --> 00:25.360\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:25.360 --> 00:29.840\n Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Indeed.\n\n00:29.840 --> 00:33.160\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:33.160 --> 00:35.020\n As a side note, let me say that geometry\n\n00:35.020 --> 00:37.440\n is what made me fall in love with mathematics\n\n00:37.440 --> 00:38.560\n when I was young.\n\n00:38.560 --> 00:41.100\n It first showed me that something definitive\n\n00:41.100 --> 00:42.960\n could be stated about this world\n\n00:42.960 --> 00:45.440\n through intuitive visual proofs.\n\n00:45.440 --> 00:47.840\n Somehow, that convinced me that math\n\n00:47.840 --> 00:50.600\n is not just abstract numbers devoid of life,\n\n00:50.600 --> 00:53.380\n but a part of life, part of this world,\n\n00:53.380 --> 00:55.720\n part of our search for meaning.\n\n00:55.720 --> 00:57.680\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast,\n\n00:57.680 --> 01:00.900\n and here is my conversation with Jordan Ellenberg.\n\n01:01.860 --> 01:03.880\n If the brain is a cake.\n\n01:03.880 --> 01:05.040\n It is?\n\n01:05.040 --> 01:07.080\n Well, let's just go with me on this, okay?\n\n01:07.080 --> 01:08.160\n Okay, we'll pause it.\n\n01:08.160 --> 01:12.680\n So for Noam Chomsky, language,\n\n01:12.680 --> 01:16.000\n the universal grammar, the framework\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:19.960\n from which language springs is like most of the cake,\n\n01:19.960 --> 01:21.880\n the delicious chocolate center,\n\n01:21.880 --> 01:25.040\n and then the rest of cognition that we think of\n\n01:25.040 --> 01:27.760\n is built on top, extra layers,\n\n01:27.760 --> 01:28.940\n maybe the icing on the cake,\n\n01:28.940 --> 01:33.100\n maybe consciousness is just like a cherry on top.\n\n01:34.100 --> 01:37.980\n Where do you put in this cake mathematical thinking?\n\n01:37.980 --> 01:40.800\n Is it as fundamental as language?\n\n01:40.800 --> 01:44.600\n In the Chomsky view, is it more fundamental than language?\n\n01:44.600 --> 01:47.760\n Is it echoes of the same kind of abstract framework\n\n01:47.760 --> 01:49.480\n that he's thinking about in terms of language\n\n01:49.480 --> 01:52.160\n that they're all really tightly interconnected?\n\n01:52.980 --> 01:54.880\n That's a really interesting question.\n\n01:54.880 --> 01:56.560\n You're getting me to reflect on this question\n\n01:56.560 --> 02:00.780\n of whether the feeling of producing mathematical output,\n\n02:00.780 --> 02:04.400\n if you want, is like the process of uttering language\n\n02:04.400 --> 02:05.960\n or producing linguistic output.\n\n02:07.080 --> 02:09.000\n I think it feels something like that,\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:10.640\n and it's certainly the case.\n\n02:10.640 --> 02:11.480\n Let me put it this way.\n\n02:11.480 --> 02:14.480\n It's hard to imagine doing mathematics\n\n02:14.480 --> 02:17.400\n in a completely nonlinguistic way.\n\n02:17.400 --> 02:19.680\n It's hard to imagine doing mathematics\n\n02:19.680 --> 02:22.040\n without talking about mathematics\n\n02:22.040 --> 02:23.800\n and sort of thinking in propositions.\n\n02:23.800 --> 02:26.800\n But maybe it's just because that's the way I do mathematics,\n\n02:26.800 --> 02:29.600\n and maybe I can't imagine it any other way, right?\n\n02:29.600 --> 02:32.760\n Well, what about visualizing shapes,\n\n02:32.760 --> 02:35.680\n visualizing concepts to which language\n\n02:35.680 --> 02:38.240\n is not obviously attachable?\n\n02:38.240 --> 02:40.120\n Ah, that's a really interesting question.\n\n02:40.120 --> 02:43.560\n And one thing it reminds me of is one thing I talk about\n\n02:43.560 --> 02:45.800\n in the book is dissection proofs,\n\n02:45.800 --> 02:48.760\n these very beautiful proofs of geometric propositions.\n\n02:48.760 --> 02:50.520\n There's a very famous one by Baskara\n\n02:50.520 --> 02:55.520\n of the Pythagorean theorem, proofs which are purely visual,\n\n02:56.560 --> 03:00.260\n proofs where you show that two quantities are the same\n\n03:00.260 --> 03:04.360\n by taking the same pieces and putting them together one way\n\n03:04.360 --> 03:07.400\n and making one shape and putting them together another way\n\n03:07.400 --> 03:08.520\n and making a different shape,\n\n03:08.520 --> 03:09.760\n and then observing that those two shapes\n\n03:09.760 --> 03:10.640\n must have the same area\n\n03:10.640 --> 03:13.120\n because they were built out of the same pieces.\n\n03:14.520 --> 03:16.120\n There's a famous story,\n\n03:16.120 --> 03:19.300\n and it's a little bit disputed about how accurate this is,\n\n03:19.300 --> 03:20.680\n but that in Baskara's manuscript,\n\n03:20.680 --> 03:22.620\n he sort of gives this proof, just gives the diagram,\n\n03:22.620 --> 03:26.160\n and then the entire verbal content of the proof\n\n03:26.160 --> 03:28.400\n is he just writes under it, behold.\n\n03:28.400 --> 03:29.240\n Like that's it.\n\n03:29.240 --> 03:32.280\n And it's like, there's some dispute\n\n03:32.280 --> 03:33.680\n about exactly how accurate that is.\n\n03:33.680 --> 03:36.520\n But so then there's an interesting question.\n\n03:36.520 --> 03:39.920\n If your proof is a diagram, if your proof is a picture,\n\n03:39.920 --> 03:42.280\n or even if your proof is like a movie of the same pieces\n\n03:42.280 --> 03:43.940\n like coming together in two different formations\n\n03:43.940 --> 03:45.760\n to make two different things, is that language?\n\n03:45.760 --> 03:46.600\n I'm not sure I have a good answer.\n\n03:46.600 --> 03:47.680\n What do you think?\n\n03:47.680 --> 03:51.080\n I think it is. I think the process\n\n03:51.080 --> 03:55.000\n of manipulating the visual elements\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:56.520\n is the same as the process\n\n03:56.520 --> 03:59.480\n of manipulating the elements of language.\n\n03:59.480 --> 04:02.960\n And I think probably the manipulating, the aggregation,\n\n04:02.960 --> 04:05.800\n the stitching stuff together is the important part.\n\n04:05.800 --> 04:07.680\n It's not the actual specific elements.\n\n04:07.680 --> 04:10.520\n It's more like, to me, language is a process\n\n04:10.520 --> 04:11.780\n and math is a process.\n\n04:11.780 --> 04:15.040\n It's not just specific symbols.\n\n04:15.040 --> 04:18.160\n It's in action.\n\n04:19.080 --> 04:23.680\n It's ultimately created through action, through change.\n\n04:23.680 --> 04:26.200\n And so you're constantly evolving ideas.\n\n04:26.200 --> 04:27.880\n Of course, we kind of attach,\n\n04:27.880 --> 04:29.760\n there's a certain destination you arrive to\n\n04:29.760 --> 04:32.080\n that you attach to and you call that a proof,\n\n04:32.080 --> 04:34.600\n but that's not, that doesn't need to end there.\n\n04:34.600 --> 04:36.000\n It's just at the end of the chapter\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:39.160\n and then it goes on and on and on in that kind of way.\n\n04:39.160 --> 04:40.720\n But I gotta ask you about geometry\n\n04:40.720 --> 04:44.840\n and it's a prominent topic in your new book, Shape.\n\n04:44.840 --> 04:48.020\n So for me, geometry is the thing,\n\n04:48.020 --> 04:49.560\n just like as you're saying,\n\n04:49.560 --> 04:52.360\n made me fall in love with mathematics when I was young.\n\n04:53.340 --> 04:55.720\n So being able to prove something visually\n\n04:56.760 --> 05:01.000\n just did something to my brain that it had this,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.600\n it planted this hopeful seed\n\n05:02.600 --> 05:07.320\n that you can understand the world, like perfectly.\n\n05:07.320 --> 05:08.580\n Maybe it's an OCD thing,\n\n05:08.580 --> 05:10.440\n but from a mathematics perspective,\n\n05:10.440 --> 05:14.480\n like humans are messy, the world is messy, biology is messy.\n\n05:14.480 --> 05:17.120\n Your parents are yelling or making you do stuff,\n\n05:17.120 --> 05:19.560\n but you can cut through all that BS\n\n05:19.560 --> 05:22.000\n and truly understand the world through mathematics\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.320\n and nothing like geometry did that for me.\n\n05:25.320 --> 05:28.240\n For you, you did not immediately fall in love\n\n05:28.240 --> 05:33.240\n with geometry, so how do you think about geometry?\n\n05:33.760 --> 05:36.740\n Why is it a special field in mathematics?\n\n05:36.740 --> 05:39.920\n And how did you fall in love with it if you have?\n\n05:39.920 --> 05:41.760\n Wow, you've given me like a lot to say.\n\n05:41.760 --> 05:44.320\n And certainly the experience that you describe\n\n05:44.320 --> 05:47.460\n is so typical, but there's two versions of it.\n\n05:48.400 --> 05:49.240\n One thing I say in the book\n\n05:49.240 --> 05:51.720\n is that geometry is the cilantro of math.\n\n05:51.720 --> 05:52.880\n People are not neutral about it.\n\n05:52.880 --> 05:55.560\n There's people who like you are like,\n\n05:55.560 --> 05:56.840\n the rest of it I could take or leave,\n\n05:56.840 --> 05:59.200\n but then at this one moment, it made sense.\n\n05:59.200 --> 06:01.400\n This class made sense, why wasn't it all like that?\n\n06:01.400 --> 06:02.880\n There's other people, I can tell you,\n\n06:02.880 --> 06:04.740\n because they come and talk to me all the time,\n\n06:04.740 --> 06:06.760\n who are like, I understood all the stuff\n\n06:06.760 --> 06:08.140\n where you're trying to figure out what X was,\n\n06:08.140 --> 06:09.460\n there's some mystery you're trying to solve it,\n\n06:09.460 --> 06:10.680\n X is a number, I figured it out.\n\n06:10.680 --> 06:12.960\n But then there was this geometry, like what was that?\n\n06:12.960 --> 06:14.360\n What happened that year? Like I didn't get it.\n\n06:14.360 --> 06:15.480\n I was like lost the whole year\n\n06:15.480 --> 06:17.080\n and I didn't understand like why we even\n\n06:17.080 --> 06:18.160\n spent the time doing that.\n\n06:18.160 --> 06:20.440\n So, but what everybody agrees on\n\n06:20.440 --> 06:22.360\n is that it's somehow different, right?\n\n06:22.360 --> 06:24.120\n There's something special about it.\n\n06:25.800 --> 06:27.120\n We're gonna walk around in circles a little bit,\n\n06:27.120 --> 06:27.960\n but we'll get there.\n\n06:27.960 --> 06:32.440\n You asked me how I fell in love with math.\n\n06:32.440 --> 06:33.740\n I have a story about this.\n\n06:36.800 --> 06:39.040\n When I was a small child, I don't know,\n\n06:39.040 --> 06:42.040\n maybe like I was six or seven, I don't know.\n\n06:42.040 --> 06:42.880\n I'm from the 70s.\n\n06:42.880 --> 06:44.440\n I think you're from a different decade than that.\n\n06:44.440 --> 06:48.560\n But in the 70s, we had a cool wooden box\n\n06:48.560 --> 06:49.520\n around your stereo.\n\n06:49.520 --> 06:51.460\n That was the look, everything was dark wood.\n\n06:51.460 --> 06:53.560\n And the box had a bunch of holes in it\n\n06:53.560 --> 06:54.600\n to let the sound out.\n\n06:56.320 --> 06:58.960\n And the holes were in this rectangular array,\n\n06:58.960 --> 07:02.480\n a six by eight array of holes.\n\n07:02.480 --> 07:04.280\n And I was just kind of like zoning out\n\n07:04.280 --> 07:06.040\n in the living room as kids do,\n\n07:06.040 --> 07:09.800\n looking at this six by eight rectangular array of holes.\n\n07:09.800 --> 07:12.720\n And if you like, just by kind of like focusing in and out,\n\n07:12.720 --> 07:14.480\n just by kind of looking at this box,\n\n07:14.480 --> 07:17.080\n looking at this rectangle, I was like,\n\n07:17.080 --> 07:20.860\n well, there's six rows of eight holes each,\n\n07:21.900 --> 07:25.640\n but there's also eight columns of six holes each.\n\n07:25.640 --> 07:26.480\n Whoa.\n\n07:26.480 --> 07:29.040\n So eight sixes and six eights.\n\n07:29.040 --> 07:30.080\n It's just like the dissection proofs\n\n07:30.080 --> 07:32.320\n we were just talking about, but it's the same holes.\n\n07:32.320 --> 07:33.480\n It's the same 48 holes.\n\n07:33.480 --> 07:34.320\n That's how many there are,\n\n07:34.320 --> 07:36.800\n no matter whether you count them as rows\n\n07:36.800 --> 07:38.000\n or count them as columns.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:41.760\n And this was like unbelievable to me.\n\n07:41.760 --> 07:43.000\n Am I allowed to cuss on your podcast?\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.240\n I don't know if that's, are we FCC regulated?\n\n07:45.240 --> 07:47.080\n Okay, it was fucking unbelievable.\n\n07:47.080 --> 07:48.000\n Okay, that's the last time.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:48.840\n Get it in there.\n\n07:48.840 --> 07:49.660\n This story merits it.\n\n07:49.660 --> 07:54.240\n So two different perspectives in the same physical reality.\n\n07:54.240 --> 07:55.280\n Exactly.\n\n07:55.280 --> 07:56.860\n And it's just as you say.\n\n07:58.520 --> 08:01.440\n I knew that six times eight was the same as eight times six.\n\n08:01.440 --> 08:02.640\n I knew my times tables.\n\n08:02.640 --> 08:04.720\n I knew that that was a fact.\n\n08:04.720 --> 08:06.600\n But did I really know it until that moment?\n\n08:06.600 --> 08:08.640\n That's the question, right?\n\n08:08.640 --> 08:11.640\n I sort of knew that the times table was symmetric,\n\n08:11.640 --> 08:13.960\n but I didn't know why that was the case until that moment.\n\n08:13.960 --> 08:15.160\n And in that moment I could see like,\n\n08:15.160 --> 08:17.700\n oh, I didn't have to have somebody tell me that.\n\n08:17.700 --> 08:20.200\n That's information that you can just directly access.\n\n08:20.200 --> 08:21.600\n That's a really amazing moment.\n\n08:21.600 --> 08:22.920\n And as math teachers, that's something\n\n08:22.920 --> 08:25.560\n that we're really trying to bring to our students.\n\n08:25.560 --> 08:27.560\n And I was one of those who did not love\n\n08:27.560 --> 08:30.540\n the kind of Euclidean geometry ninth grade class\n\n08:30.540 --> 08:33.080\n of like prove that an isosceles triangle\n\n08:33.080 --> 08:35.520\n has equal angles at the base, like this kind of thing.\n\n08:35.520 --> 08:39.020\n It didn't vibe with me the way that algebra and numbers did.\n\n08:39.020 --> 08:40.720\n But if you go back to that moment,\n\n08:40.720 --> 08:41.860\n from my adult perspective,\n\n08:41.860 --> 08:43.620\n looking back at what happened with that rectangle,\n\n08:43.620 --> 08:45.460\n I think that is a very geometric moment.\n\n08:45.460 --> 08:49.040\n In fact, that moment exactly encapsulates\n\n08:49.920 --> 08:53.060\n the intertwining of algebra and geometry.\n\n08:53.060 --> 08:55.880\n This algebraic fact that, well, in the instance,\n\n08:55.880 --> 08:57.880\n eight times six is equal to six times eight.\n\n08:57.880 --> 09:00.160\n But in general, that whatever two numbers you have,\n\n09:00.160 --> 09:01.320\n you multiply them one way.\n\n09:01.320 --> 09:02.760\n And it's the same as if you multiply them\n\n09:02.760 --> 09:03.700\n in the other order.\n\n09:03.700 --> 09:07.500\n It attaches it to this geometric fact about a rectangle,\n\n09:07.500 --> 09:09.540\n which in some sense makes it true.\n\n09:09.540 --> 09:11.380\n So, who knows, maybe I was always fated\n\n09:11.380 --> 09:12.380\n to be an algebraic geometer,\n\n09:12.380 --> 09:15.060\n which is what I am as a researcher.\n\n09:15.060 --> 09:17.340\n So that's the kind of transformation.\n\n09:17.340 --> 09:19.340\n And you talk about symmetry in your book.\n\n09:20.340 --> 09:22.040\n What the heck is symmetry?\n\n09:22.940 --> 09:26.260\n What the heck is these kinds of transformation on objects\n\n09:26.260 --> 09:29.480\n that once you transform them, they seem to be similar?\n\n09:29.480 --> 09:30.500\n What do you make of it?\n\n09:30.500 --> 09:32.180\n What's its use in mathematics\n\n09:32.180 --> 09:35.340\n or maybe broadly in understanding our world?\n\n09:35.340 --> 09:37.380\n Well, it's an absolutely fundamental concept.\n\n09:37.380 --> 09:39.740\n And it starts with the word symmetry\n\n09:39.740 --> 09:41.220\n in the way that we usually use it\n\n09:41.220 --> 09:42.620\n when we're just like talking English\n\n09:42.620 --> 09:43.780\n and not talking mathematics, right?\n\n09:43.780 --> 09:46.940\n Sort of something is, when we say something is symmetrical,\n\n09:46.940 --> 09:49.820\n we usually means it has what's called an axis of symmetry.\n\n09:49.820 --> 09:51.260\n Maybe like the left half of it\n\n09:51.260 --> 09:52.580\n looks the same as the right half.\n\n09:52.580 --> 09:55.020\n That would be like a left, right axis of symmetry.\n\n09:55.020 --> 09:57.820\n Or maybe the top half looks like the bottom half or both.\n\n09:57.820 --> 09:59.320\n Maybe there's sort of a fourfold symmetry\n\n09:59.320 --> 10:00.160\n where the top looks like the bottom\n\n10:00.160 --> 10:03.620\n and the left looks like the right or more.\n\n10:03.620 --> 10:06.380\n And that can take you in a lot of different directions.\n\n10:06.380 --> 10:09.480\n The abstract study of what the possible combinations\n\n10:09.480 --> 10:10.480\n of symmetries there are,\n\n10:10.480 --> 10:11.820\n a subject which is called group theory\n\n10:11.820 --> 10:14.940\n was actually one of my first loves in mathematics\n\n10:14.940 --> 10:17.600\n when I thought about a lot when I was in college.\n\n10:17.600 --> 10:21.300\n But the notion of symmetry is actually much more general\n\n10:21.300 --> 10:23.100\n than the things that we would call symmetry\n\n10:23.100 --> 10:25.480\n if we were looking at like a classical building\n\n10:25.480 --> 10:30.300\n or a painting or something like that.\n\n10:30.300 --> 10:33.280\n Nowadays in math,\n\n10:35.520 --> 10:38.740\n we could use a symmetry to refer to\n\n10:38.740 --> 10:41.580\n any kind of transformation of an image\n\n10:41.580 --> 10:43.900\n or a space or an object.\n\n10:43.900 --> 10:46.500\n So what I talk about in the book is\n\n10:48.040 --> 10:50.580\n take a figure and stretch it vertically,\n\n10:50.580 --> 10:53.940\n make it twice as big vertically\n\n10:53.940 --> 10:56.360\n and make it half as wide.\n\n10:58.920 --> 11:00.100\n That I would call a symmetry.\n\n11:00.100 --> 11:03.300\n It's not a symmetry in the classical sense,\n\n11:03.300 --> 11:05.740\n but it's a well defined transformation\n\n11:05.740 --> 11:07.620\n that has an input and an output.\n\n11:07.620 --> 11:10.960\n I give you some shape and it gets kind of,\n\n11:10.960 --> 11:12.180\n I call this in the book a scrunch.\n\n11:12.180 --> 11:14.460\n I just had to make up some sort of funny sounding name\n\n11:14.460 --> 11:18.360\n for it because it doesn't really have a name.\n\n11:20.120 --> 11:21.740\n And just as you can sort of study\n\n11:21.740 --> 11:23.820\n which kinds of objects are symmetrical\n\n11:23.820 --> 11:26.020\n under the operations of switching left and right\n\n11:26.020 --> 11:27.540\n or switching top and bottom\n\n11:27.540 --> 11:29.900\n or rotating 40 degrees or what have you,\n\n11:31.580 --> 11:33.900\n you could study what kinds of things are preserved\n\n11:33.900 --> 11:36.360\n by this kind of scrunch symmetry.\n\n11:36.360 --> 11:39.500\n And this kind of more general idea\n\n11:39.500 --> 11:40.920\n of what a symmetry can be.\n\n11:42.520 --> 11:43.720\n Let me put it this way.\n\n11:44.860 --> 11:47.300\n A fundamental mathematical idea,\n\n11:47.300 --> 11:49.020\n in some sense, I might even say the idea\n\n11:49.020 --> 11:51.380\n that dominates contemporary mathematics.\n\n11:51.380 --> 11:52.380\n Or by contemporary, by the way,\n\n11:52.380 --> 11:54.260\n I mean like the last like 150 years.\n\n11:54.260 --> 11:56.220\n We're on a very long time scale in math.\n\n11:56.220 --> 11:57.060\n I don't mean like yesterday.\n\n11:57.060 --> 12:00.960\n I mean like a century or so up till now.\n\n12:00.960 --> 12:02.580\n Is this idea that it's a fundamental question\n\n12:02.580 --> 12:07.140\n of when do we consider two things to be the same?\n\n12:07.140 --> 12:08.740\n That might seem like a complete triviality.\n\n12:08.740 --> 12:10.020\n It's not.\n\n12:10.020 --> 12:12.140\n For instance, if I have a triangle\n\n12:13.200 --> 12:14.940\n and I have a triangle of the exact same dimensions,\n\n12:14.940 --> 12:19.340\n but it's over here, are those the same or different?\n\n12:19.340 --> 12:20.280\n Well, you might say, well, look,\n\n12:20.280 --> 12:21.120\n there's two different things.\n\n12:21.120 --> 12:22.420\n This one's over here, this one's over there.\n\n12:22.420 --> 12:25.780\n On the other hand, if you prove a theorem about this one,\n\n12:25.780 --> 12:27.700\n it's probably still true about this one\n\n12:27.700 --> 12:29.860\n if it has like all the same side lanes and angles\n\n12:29.860 --> 12:31.460\n and like looks exactly the same.\n\n12:31.460 --> 12:32.660\n The term of art, if you want it,\n\n12:32.660 --> 12:34.740\n you would say they're congruent.\n\n12:34.740 --> 12:36.840\n But one way of saying it is there's a symmetry\n\n12:36.840 --> 12:38.620\n called translation, which just means\n\n12:38.620 --> 12:40.780\n move everything three inches to the left.\n\n12:40.780 --> 12:43.100\n And we want all of our theories\n\n12:43.100 --> 12:45.460\n to be translation invariant.\n\n12:45.460 --> 12:46.940\n What that means is that if you prove a theorem\n\n12:46.940 --> 12:48.880\n about a thing that's over here,\n\n12:48.880 --> 12:51.660\n and then you move it three inches to the left,\n\n12:51.660 --> 12:53.460\n it would be kind of weird if all of your theorems\n\n12:53.460 --> 12:55.820\n like didn't still work.\n\n12:55.820 --> 12:58.620\n So this question of like, what are the symmetries\n\n12:58.620 --> 12:59.940\n and which things that you want to study\n\n12:59.940 --> 13:01.460\n are invariant under those symmetries\n\n13:01.460 --> 13:02.380\n is absolutely fundamental.\n\n13:02.380 --> 13:04.020\n Boy, this is getting a little abstract, right?\n\n13:04.020 --> 13:05.160\n It's not at all abstract.\n\n13:05.160 --> 13:08.380\n I think this is completely central\n\n13:08.380 --> 13:09.760\n to everything I think about\n\n13:09.760 --> 13:11.380\n in terms of artificial intelligence.\n\n13:11.380 --> 13:13.540\n I don't know if you know about the MNIST dataset,\n\n13:13.540 --> 13:15.140\n what's handwritten digits.\n\n13:15.140 --> 13:20.140\n And you know, I don't smoke much weed or any really,\n\n13:21.680 --> 13:24.240\n but it certainly feels like it when I look at MNIST\n\n13:24.240 --> 13:26.360\n and think about this stuff, which is like,\n\n13:26.360 --> 13:28.600\n what's the difference between one and two?\n\n13:28.600 --> 13:32.200\n And why are all the twos similar to each other?\n\n13:32.200 --> 13:37.200\n What kind of transformations are within the category\n\n13:37.200 --> 13:39.160\n of what makes a thing the same?\n\n13:39.160 --> 13:40.720\n And what kind of transformations\n\n13:40.720 --> 13:42.520\n are those that make it different?\n\n13:42.520 --> 13:44.020\n And symmetries core to that.\n\n13:44.020 --> 13:46.760\n In fact, whatever the hell our brain is doing,\n\n13:46.760 --> 13:50.440\n it's really good at constructing these arbitrary\n\n13:50.440 --> 13:53.160\n and sometimes novel, which is really important\n\n13:53.160 --> 13:58.000\n when you look at like the IQ test or they feel novel,\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:02.880\n ideas of symmetry of like playing with objects,\n\n14:02.880 --> 14:06.120\n we're able to see things that are the same and not\n\n14:07.020 --> 14:11.720\n and construct almost like little geometric theories\n\n14:11.720 --> 14:13.400\n of what makes things the same and not\n\n14:13.400 --> 14:17.400\n and how to make programs do that in AI\n\n14:17.400 --> 14:19.120\n is a total open question.\n\n14:19.120 --> 14:21.840\n And so I kind of stared and wonder\n\n14:22.960 --> 14:27.040\n how, what kind of symmetries are enough to solve\n\n14:27.040 --> 14:30.880\n the MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem\n\n14:30.880 --> 14:32.320\n and write that down.\n\n14:32.320 --> 14:33.880\n And exactly, and what's so fascinating\n\n14:33.880 --> 14:35.440\n about the work in that direction\n\n14:35.440 --> 14:38.320\n from the point of view of a mathematician like me\n\n14:38.320 --> 14:42.560\n and a geometer is that the kind of groups of symmetries,\n\n14:42.560 --> 14:45.960\n the types of symmetries that we know of are not sufficient.\n\n14:45.960 --> 14:48.680\n So in other words, like we're just gonna keep on going\n\n14:48.680 --> 14:49.740\n into the weeds on this.\n\n14:51.320 --> 14:52.520\n The deeper, the better.\n\n14:53.680 --> 14:55.320\n A kind of symmetry that we understand very well\n\n14:55.320 --> 14:56.720\n is rotation.\n\n14:56.720 --> 14:57.920\n So here's what would be easy.\n\n14:57.920 --> 15:01.980\n If humans, if we recognize the digit as a one,\n\n15:01.980 --> 15:03.640\n if it was like literally a rotation\n\n15:03.640 --> 15:07.220\n by some number of degrees or some fixed one\n\n15:07.220 --> 15:10.440\n in some typeface like Palatino or something,\n\n15:10.440 --> 15:12.080\n that would be very easy to understand.\n\n15:12.080 --> 15:13.960\n It would be very easy to like write a program\n\n15:13.960 --> 15:17.400\n that could detect whether something was a rotation\n\n15:17.400 --> 15:20.680\n of a fixed digit one.\n\n15:20.680 --> 15:22.640\n Whatever we're doing when you recognize the digit one\n\n15:22.640 --> 15:25.920\n and distinguish it from the digit two, it's not that.\n\n15:25.920 --> 15:30.680\n It's not just incorporating one of the types of symmetries\n\n15:30.680 --> 15:32.120\n that we understand.\n\n15:32.120 --> 15:36.640\n Now, I would say that I would be shocked\n\n15:36.640 --> 15:40.640\n if there was some kind of classical symmetry type formulation\n\n15:40.640 --> 15:43.360\n that captured what we're doing\n\n15:43.360 --> 15:45.600\n when we tell the difference between a two and a three.\n\n15:45.600 --> 15:48.040\n To be honest, I think what we're doing\n\n15:48.040 --> 15:50.240\n is actually more complicated than that.\n\n15:50.240 --> 15:52.280\n I feel like it must be.\n\n15:52.280 --> 15:53.680\n They're so simple, these numbers.\n\n15:53.680 --> 15:55.840\n I mean, they're really geometric objects.\n\n15:55.840 --> 15:58.600\n Like we can draw out one, two, three.\n\n15:58.600 --> 16:01.160\n It does seem like it should be formalizable.\n\n16:01.160 --> 16:03.280\n That's why it's so strange.\n\n16:03.280 --> 16:04.220\n Do you think it's formalizable\n\n16:04.220 --> 16:06.840\n when something stops being a two and starts being a three?\n\n16:06.840 --> 16:09.000\n Right, you can imagine something continuously deforming\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.120\n from being a two to a three.\n\n16:11.120 --> 16:15.440\n Yeah, but that's, there is a moment.\n\n16:15.440 --> 16:17.620\n Like I have myself written programs\n\n16:17.620 --> 16:20.760\n that literally morph twos and threes and so on.\n\n16:20.760 --> 16:23.960\n And you watch, and there is moments that you notice\n\n16:23.960 --> 16:26.920\n depending on the trajectory of that transformation,\n\n16:26.920 --> 16:31.920\n that morphing, that it is a three and a two.\n\n16:32.480 --> 16:33.600\n There's a hard line.\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:36.360\n Wait, so if you ask people, if you showed them this morph,\n\n16:36.360 --> 16:37.360\n if you ask a bunch of people,\n\n16:37.360 --> 16:39.800\n do they all agree about where the transition happened?\n\n16:39.800 --> 16:40.760\n Because I would be surprised.\n\n16:40.760 --> 16:41.600\n I think so.\n\n16:41.600 --> 16:42.920\n Oh my God, okay, we have an empirical dispute.\n\n16:42.920 --> 16:44.600\n But here's the problem.\n\n16:44.600 --> 16:48.240\n Here's the problem, that if I just showed that moment\n\n16:48.240 --> 16:50.680\n that I agreed on.\n\n16:50.680 --> 16:51.720\n Well, that's not fair.\n\n16:51.720 --> 16:53.480\n No, but say I said,\n\n16:53.480 --> 16:55.080\n so I want to move away from the agreement\n\n16:55.080 --> 16:57.320\n because that's a fascinating actually question\n\n16:57.320 --> 17:02.320\n that I want to backtrack from because I just dogmatically\n\n17:02.400 --> 17:04.840\n said, because I could be very, very wrong.\n\n17:04.840 --> 17:09.840\n But the morphing really helps that like the change,\n\n17:09.960 --> 17:11.880\n because I mean, partially it's because our perception\n\n17:11.880 --> 17:15.040\n systems, see this, it's all probably tied in there.\n\n17:15.040 --> 17:18.000\n Somehow the change from one to the other,\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\n like seeing the video of it allows you to pinpoint\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.680\n the place where a two becomes a three much better.\n\n17:23.680 --> 17:26.000\n If I just showed you one picture,\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:31.000\n I think you might really, really struggle.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.120\n You might call a seven.\n\n17:32.120 --> 17:37.120\n I think there's something also that we don't often\n\n17:38.280 --> 17:41.600\n think about, which is it's not just about the static image,\n\n17:41.600 --> 17:43.960\n it's the transformation of the image,\n\n17:43.960 --> 17:45.560\n or it's not a static shape,\n\n17:45.560 --> 17:47.600\n it's the transformation of the shape.\n\n17:47.600 --> 17:51.560\n There's something in the movement that seems to be\n\n17:51.560 --> 17:53.320\n not just about our perception system,\n\n17:53.320 --> 17:55.040\n but fundamental to our cognition,\n\n17:55.040 --> 17:57.720\n like how we think about stuff.\n\n17:57.720 --> 18:00.360\n Yeah, and that's part of geometry too.\n\n18:00.360 --> 18:03.200\n And in fact, again, another insight of modern geometry\n\n18:03.200 --> 18:06.040\n is this idea that maybe we would naively think\n\n18:06.040 --> 18:08.320\n we're gonna study, I don't know,\n\n18:08.320 --> 18:10.400\n like Poincare, we're gonna study the three body problem.\n\n18:10.400 --> 18:13.440\n We're gonna study sort of like three objects in space\n\n18:13.440 --> 18:15.240\n moving around subject only to the force\n\n18:15.240 --> 18:17.560\n of each other's gravity, which sounds very simple, right?\n\n18:17.560 --> 18:18.720\n And if you don't know about this problem,\n\n18:18.720 --> 18:20.040\n you're probably like, okay, so you just like put it\n\n18:20.040 --> 18:21.240\n in your computer and see what they do.\n\n18:21.240 --> 18:22.080\n Well, guess what?\n\n18:22.080 --> 18:25.080\n That's like a problem that Poincare won a huge prize for\n\n18:25.080 --> 18:27.360\n like making the first real progress on in the 1880s.\n\n18:27.360 --> 18:32.200\n And we still don't know that much about it 150 years later.\n\n18:32.200 --> 18:34.800\n I mean, it's a humongous mystery.\n\n18:34.800 --> 18:38.000\n You just opened the door and we're gonna walk right in\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.840\n before we return to symmetry.\n\n18:40.840 --> 18:44.840\n What's the, who's Poincare and what's this conjecture\n\n18:44.840 --> 18:46.680\n that he came up with?\n\n18:46.680 --> 18:48.560\n Why is it such a hard problem?\n\n18:48.560 --> 18:52.120\n Okay, so Poincare, he ends up being a major figure\n\n18:52.120 --> 18:54.200\n in the book and I didn't even really intend for him\n\n18:54.200 --> 18:59.200\n to be such a big figure, but he's first and foremost\n\n18:59.280 --> 19:00.120\n a geometer, right?\n\n19:00.120 --> 19:02.600\n So he's a mathematician who kind of comes up\n\n19:02.600 --> 19:07.600\n in late 19th century France at a time when French math\n\n19:07.880 --> 19:09.360\n is really starting to flower.\n\n19:09.360 --> 19:10.200\n Actually, I learned a lot.\n\n19:10.200 --> 19:11.640\n I mean, in math, we're not really trained\n\n19:11.640 --> 19:12.680\n on our own history.\n\n19:12.680 --> 19:14.240\n We got a PhD in math, learned about math.\n\n19:14.240 --> 19:15.200\n So I learned a lot.\n\n19:15.200 --> 19:18.600\n There's this whole kind of moment where France\n\n19:18.600 --> 19:22.040\n has just been beaten in the Franco Prussian war.\n\n19:22.040 --> 19:23.840\n And they're like, oh my God, what did we do wrong?\n\n19:23.840 --> 19:26.440\n And they were like, we gotta get strong in math\n\n19:26.440 --> 19:27.280\n like the Germans.\n\n19:27.280 --> 19:28.440\n We have to be like more like the Germans.\n\n19:28.440 --> 19:29.880\n So this never happens to us again.\n\n19:29.880 --> 19:31.960\n So it's very much, it's like the Sputnik moment,\n\n19:31.960 --> 19:34.600\n like what happens in America in the 50s and 60s\n\n19:34.600 --> 19:35.440\n with the Soviet Union.\n\n19:35.440 --> 19:37.280\n This is happening to France and they're trying\n\n19:37.280 --> 19:40.360\n to kind of like instantly like modernize.\n\n19:40.360 --> 19:43.120\n That's fascinating that the humans and mathematics\n\n19:43.120 --> 19:46.800\n are intricately connected to the history of humans.\n\n19:46.800 --> 19:51.800\n The Cold War is I think fundamental to the way people\n\n19:51.800 --> 19:55.160\n saw science and math in the Soviet Union.\n\n19:55.160 --> 19:56.720\n I don't know if that was true in the United States,\n\n19:56.720 --> 19:58.520\n but certainly it was in the Soviet Union.\n\n19:58.520 --> 20:00.000\n It definitely was, and I would love to hear more\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:01.560\n about how it was in the Soviet Union.\n\n20:01.560 --> 20:04.960\n I mean, there was, and we'll talk about the Olympiad.\n\n20:04.960 --> 20:08.720\n I just remember that there was this feeling\n\n20:09.720 --> 20:14.320\n like the world hung in a balance\n\n20:14.320 --> 20:19.320\n and you could save the world with the tools of science.\n\n20:19.320 --> 20:24.320\n And mathematics was like the superpower that fuels science.\n\n20:26.520 --> 20:30.240\n And so like people were seen as, you know,\n\n20:30.240 --> 20:32.880\n people in America often idolize athletes,\n\n20:32.880 --> 20:35.680\n but ultimately the best athletes in the world,\n\n20:36.920 --> 20:40.000\n they just throw a ball into a basket.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.240\n So like there's not, what people really enjoy about sports,\n\n20:44.240 --> 20:48.640\n I love sports, is like excellence at the highest level.\n\n20:48.640 --> 20:51.320\n But when you take that with mathematics and science,\n\n20:51.320 --> 20:54.280\n people also enjoyed excellence in science and mathematics\n\n20:54.280 --> 20:56.880\n in the Soviet Union, but there's an extra sense\n\n20:56.880 --> 21:00.320\n that that excellence would lead to a better world.\n\n21:01.400 --> 21:06.400\n So that created all the usual things you think about\n\n21:07.360 --> 21:12.160\n with the Olympics, which is like extreme competitiveness.\n\n21:12.160 --> 21:15.120\n But it also created this sense that in the modern era\n\n21:15.120 --> 21:19.400\n in America, somebody like Elon Musk, whatever you think\n\n21:19.400 --> 21:21.480\n of him, like Jeff Bezos, those folks,\n\n21:21.480 --> 21:24.480\n they inspire the possibility that one person\n\n21:24.480 --> 21:27.040\n or a group of smart people can change the world.\n\n21:27.040 --> 21:29.040\n Like not just be good at what they do,\n\n21:29.040 --> 21:30.640\n but actually change the world.\n\n21:30.640 --> 21:33.320\n Mathematics was at the core of that.\n\n21:33.320 --> 21:36.040\n I don't know, there's a romanticism around it too.\n\n21:36.040 --> 21:39.480\n Like when you read books about in America,\n\n21:39.480 --> 21:42.640\n people romanticize certain things like baseball, for example.\n\n21:42.640 --> 21:45.680\n There's like these beautiful poetic writing\n\n21:45.680 --> 21:47.400\n about the game of baseball.\n\n21:47.400 --> 21:50.640\n The same was the feeling with mathematics and science\n\n21:50.640 --> 21:53.160\n in the Soviet Union, and it was in the air.\n\n21:53.160 --> 21:57.280\n Everybody was forced to take high level mathematics courses.\n\n21:57.280 --> 22:00.480\n Like you took a lot of math, you took a lot of science\n\n22:00.480 --> 22:03.240\n and a lot of like really rigorous literature.\n\n22:03.240 --> 22:06.560\n Like the level of education in Russia,\n\n22:06.560 --> 22:09.200\n this could be true in China, I'm not sure,\n\n22:09.200 --> 22:14.120\n in a lot of countries is in whatever that's called,\n\n22:14.120 --> 22:18.760\n it's K to 12 in America, but like young people education.\n\n22:18.760 --> 22:23.360\n The level they were challenged to learn at is incredible.\n\n22:23.360 --> 22:27.960\n It's like America falls far behind, I would say.\n\n22:27.960 --> 22:29.880\n America then quickly catches up\n\n22:29.880 --> 22:33.880\n and then exceeds everybody else as you start approaching\n\n22:33.880 --> 22:35.360\n the end of high school to college.\n\n22:35.360 --> 22:37.040\n Like the university system in the United States\n\n22:37.040 --> 22:39.280\n arguably is the best in the world.\n\n22:39.280 --> 22:44.200\n But like what we challenge everybody,\n\n22:44.200 --> 22:46.560\n it's not just like the good, the A students,\n\n22:46.560 --> 22:50.200\n but everybody to learn in the Soviet Union was fascinating.\n\n22:50.200 --> 22:52.080\n I think I'm gonna pick up on something you said.\n\n22:52.080 --> 22:53.800\n I think you would love a book called\n\n22:53.800 --> 22:56.360\n Dual at Dawn by Amir Alexander,\n\n22:56.360 --> 22:58.440\n which I think some of the things you're responding to\n\n22:58.440 --> 23:01.040\n and what I wrote, I think I first got turned on to\n\n23:01.040 --> 23:02.880\n by Amir's work, he's a historian of math.\n\n23:02.880 --> 23:06.040\n And he writes about the story of Everest to Galois,\n\n23:06.040 --> 23:08.320\n which is a story that's well known to all mathematicians,\n\n23:08.320 --> 23:12.880\n this kind of like very, very romantic figure\n\n23:12.880 --> 23:17.880\n who he really sort of like begins the development of this\n\n23:18.040 --> 23:20.120\n or this theory of groups that I mentioned earlier,\n\n23:20.120 --> 23:22.400\n this general theory of symmetries\n\n23:23.480 --> 23:25.520\n and then dies in a duel in his early 20s,\n\n23:25.520 --> 23:28.400\n like all this stuff, mostly unpublished.\n\n23:28.400 --> 23:31.120\n It's a very, very romantic story that we all learn.\n\n23:32.400 --> 23:33.440\n And much of it is true,\n\n23:33.440 --> 23:37.600\n but Alexander really lays out just how much\n\n23:37.600 --> 23:40.480\n the way people thought about math in those times\n\n23:40.480 --> 23:43.200\n in the early 19th century was wound up with,\n\n23:43.200 --> 23:44.480\n as you say, romanticism.\n\n23:44.480 --> 23:47.160\n I mean, that's when the romantic movement takes place\n\n23:47.160 --> 23:51.200\n and he really outlines how people were predisposed\n\n23:51.200 --> 23:52.800\n to think about mathematics in that way\n\n23:52.800 --> 23:54.240\n because they thought about poetry that way\n\n23:54.240 --> 23:55.680\n and they thought about music that way.\n\n23:55.680 --> 23:58.240\n It was the mood of the era to think about\n\n23:58.240 --> 23:59.920\n we're reaching for the transcendent,\n\n23:59.920 --> 24:02.000\n we're sort of reaching for sort of direct contact\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:02.840\n with the divine.\n\n24:02.840 --> 24:06.040\n And part of the reason that we think of Gawa that way\n\n24:06.040 --> 24:08.680\n was because Gawa himself was a creature of that era\n\n24:08.680 --> 24:10.600\n and he romanticized himself.\n\n24:10.600 --> 24:12.640\n I mean, now we know he wrote lots of letters\n\n24:12.640 --> 24:14.880\n and he was kind of like, I mean, in modern terms,\n\n24:14.880 --> 24:16.520\n we would say he was extremely emo.\n\n24:16.520 --> 24:19.800\n Like we wrote all these letters\n\n24:19.800 --> 24:21.320\n about his like florid feelings\n\n24:21.320 --> 24:23.280\n and like the fire within him about the mathematics.\n\n24:23.280 --> 24:26.280\n And so it's just as you say\n\n24:26.280 --> 24:29.600\n that the math history touches human history.\n\n24:29.600 --> 24:32.720\n They're never separate because math is made of people.\n\n24:32.720 --> 24:35.560\n I mean, that's what, it's people who do it\n\n24:35.560 --> 24:36.840\n and we're human beings doing it\n\n24:36.840 --> 24:39.120\n and we do it within whatever community we're in\n\n24:39.120 --> 24:42.640\n and we do it affected by the mores\n\n24:42.640 --> 24:44.080\n of the society around us.\n\n24:44.080 --> 24:47.360\n So the French, the Germans and Poincare.\n\n24:47.360 --> 24:48.880\n Yes, okay, so back to Poincare.\n\n24:48.880 --> 24:52.520\n So he's, you know, it's funny.\n\n24:52.520 --> 24:55.880\n This book is filled with kind of mathematical characters\n\n24:55.880 --> 25:00.080\n who often are kind of peevish or get into feuds\n\n25:00.080 --> 25:03.840\n or sort of have like weird enthusiasms\n\n25:03.840 --> 25:05.160\n because those people are fun to write about\n\n25:05.160 --> 25:07.440\n and they sort of like say very salty things.\n\n25:07.440 --> 25:09.560\n Poincare is actually none of this.\n\n25:09.560 --> 25:12.440\n As far as I can tell, he was an extremely normal dude\n\n25:12.440 --> 25:15.240\n who didn't get into fights with people\n\n25:15.240 --> 25:16.280\n and everybody liked him\n\n25:16.280 --> 25:18.040\n and he was like pretty personally modest\n\n25:18.040 --> 25:20.240\n and he had very regular habits.\n\n25:20.240 --> 25:21.080\n You know what I mean?\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:23.760\n He did math for like four hours in the morning\n\n25:23.760 --> 25:25.640\n and four hours in the evening and that was it.\n\n25:25.640 --> 25:28.200\n Like he had his schedule.\n\n25:28.200 --> 25:31.640\n I actually, it was like, I still am feeling like\n\n25:31.640 --> 25:33.360\n somebody's gonna tell me now that the book is out,\n\n25:33.360 --> 25:34.720\n like, oh, didn't you know about this\n\n25:34.720 --> 25:37.000\n like incredibly sordid episode?\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.920\n As far as I could tell, a completely normal guy.\n\n25:39.920 --> 25:44.280\n But he just kind of, in many ways,\n\n25:44.280 --> 25:47.760\n creates the geometric world in which we live\n\n25:47.760 --> 25:52.760\n and his first really big success is this prize paper\n\n25:53.360 --> 25:55.960\n he writes for this prize offered by the King of Sweden\n\n25:55.960 --> 25:59.520\n for the study of the three body problem.\n\n26:01.080 --> 26:04.240\n The study of what we can say about, yeah,\n\n26:04.240 --> 26:07.280\n three astronomical objects moving\n\n26:07.280 --> 26:09.080\n in what you might think would be this very simple way.\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:12.240\n Nothing's going on except gravity.\n\n26:12.240 --> 26:13.640\n So what's the three body problem?\n\n26:13.640 --> 26:15.000\n Why is it a problem?\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.800\n So the problem is to understand\n\n26:16.800 --> 26:20.000\n when this motion is stable and when it's not.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.840\n So stable meaning they would sort of like end up\n\n26:21.840 --> 26:23.600\n in some kind of periodic orbit.\n\n26:23.600 --> 26:25.400\n Or I guess it would mean, sorry,\n\n26:25.400 --> 26:26.960\n stable would mean they never sort of fly off\n\n26:26.960 --> 26:28.040\n far apart from each other.\n\n26:28.040 --> 26:30.160\n And unstable would mean like eventually they fly apart.\n\n26:30.160 --> 26:32.880\n So understanding two bodies is much easier.\n\n26:32.880 --> 26:33.720\n Yes, exactly.\n\n26:33.720 --> 26:36.480\n When you have the third wheel is always a problem.\n\n26:36.480 --> 26:37.320\n This is what Newton knew.\n\n26:37.320 --> 26:38.760\n Two bodies, they sort of orbit each other\n\n26:38.760 --> 26:41.280\n in some kind of either in an ellipse,\n\n26:41.280 --> 26:42.240\n which is the stable case.\n\n26:42.240 --> 26:45.240\n You know, that's what the planets do that we know.\n\n26:46.400 --> 26:49.400\n Or one travels on a hyperbola around the other.\n\n26:49.400 --> 26:50.320\n That's the unstable case.\n\n26:50.320 --> 26:51.920\n It sort of like zooms in from far away,\n\n26:51.920 --> 26:54.280\n sort of like whips around the heavier thing\n\n26:54.280 --> 26:56.720\n and like zooms out.\n\n26:56.720 --> 26:58.120\n Those are basically the two options.\n\n26:58.120 --> 27:00.840\n So it's a very simple and easy to classify story.\n\n27:00.840 --> 27:04.160\n With three bodies, just the small switch from two to three,\n\n27:04.160 --> 27:05.200\n it's a complete zoo.\n\n27:05.200 --> 27:07.000\n It's the first, what we would say now\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.920\n is it's the first example of what's called chaotic dynamics,\n\n27:09.920 --> 27:13.000\n where the stable solutions and the unstable solutions,\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.480\n they're kind of like wound in among each other.\n\n27:14.480 --> 27:17.640\n And a very, very, very tiny change in the initial conditions\n\n27:17.640 --> 27:20.200\n can make the longterm behavior of the system\n\n27:20.200 --> 27:21.200\n completely different.\n\n27:21.200 --> 27:22.960\n So Poincare was the first to recognize\n\n27:22.960 --> 27:27.000\n that that phenomenon even existed.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:31.120\n What about the conjecture that carries his name?\n\n27:31.120 --> 27:36.120\n Right, so he also was one of the pioneers\n\n27:36.880 --> 27:41.440\n of taking geometry, which until that point\n\n27:41.440 --> 27:44.080\n had been largely the study of two\n\n27:44.080 --> 27:45.240\n and three dimensional objects,\n\n27:45.240 --> 27:47.480\n because that's like what we see, right?\n\n27:47.480 --> 27:49.680\n That's those are the objects we interact with.\n\n27:49.680 --> 27:53.560\n He developed the subject we now called topology.\n\n27:53.560 --> 27:55.320\n He called it analysis situs.\n\n27:55.320 --> 27:57.840\n He was a very well spoken guy with a lot of slogans,\n\n27:57.840 --> 27:59.600\n but that name did not,\n\n27:59.600 --> 28:01.120\n you can see why that name did not catch on.\n\n28:01.120 --> 28:03.320\n So now it's called topology now.\n\n28:05.080 --> 28:06.280\n Sorry, what was it called before?\n\n28:06.280 --> 28:09.360\n Analysis situs, which I guess sort of roughly means\n\n28:09.360 --> 28:11.680\n like the analysis of location or something like that.\n\n28:11.680 --> 28:14.160\n Like it's a Latin phrase.\n\n28:14.160 --> 28:19.160\n Partly because he understood that even to understand\n\n28:19.800 --> 28:22.480\n stuff that's going on in our physical world,\n\n28:22.480 --> 28:24.400\n you have to study higher dimensional spaces.\n\n28:24.400 --> 28:25.520\n How does this work?\n\n28:25.520 --> 28:27.480\n And this is kind of like where my brain went to it\n\n28:27.480 --> 28:29.880\n because you were talking about not just where things are,\n\n28:29.880 --> 28:31.720\n but what their path is, how they're moving\n\n28:31.720 --> 28:34.840\n when we were talking about the path from two to three.\n\n28:34.840 --> 28:36.240\n He understood that if you wanna study\n\n28:36.240 --> 28:39.600\n three bodies moving in space,\n\n28:39.600 --> 28:44.040\n well, each body, it has a location where it is.\n\n28:44.040 --> 28:45.920\n So it has an X coordinate, a Y coordinate,\n\n28:45.920 --> 28:46.760\n a Z coordinate, right?\n\n28:46.760 --> 28:49.440\n I can specify a point in space by giving you three numbers,\n\n28:49.440 --> 28:52.120\n but it also at each moment has a velocity.\n\n28:53.400 --> 28:56.520\n So it turns out that really to understand what's going on,\n\n28:56.520 --> 28:58.920\n you can't think of it as a point or you could,\n\n28:58.920 --> 29:01.040\n but it's better not to think of it as a point\n\n29:01.040 --> 29:03.280\n in three dimensional space that's moving.\n\n29:03.280 --> 29:04.440\n It's better to think of it as a point\n\n29:04.440 --> 29:06.360\n in six dimensional space where the coordinates\n\n29:06.360 --> 29:09.320\n are where is it and what's its velocity right now.\n\n29:09.320 --> 29:11.800\n That's a higher dimensional space called phase space.\n\n29:11.800 --> 29:13.200\n And if you haven't thought about this before,\n\n29:13.200 --> 29:15.920\n I admit that it's a little bit mind bending,\n\n29:15.920 --> 29:20.720\n but what he needed then was a geometry\n\n29:20.720 --> 29:22.720\n that was flexible enough,\n\n29:22.720 --> 29:24.520\n not just to talk about two dimensional spaces\n\n29:24.520 --> 29:27.440\n or three dimensional spaces, but any dimensional space.\n\n29:27.440 --> 29:29.320\n So the sort of famous first line of this paper\n\n29:29.320 --> 29:30.800\n where he introduces analysis of Cetus\n\n29:30.800 --> 29:34.280\n is no one doubts nowadays that the geometry\n\n29:34.280 --> 29:37.720\n of n dimensional space is an actually existing thing, right?\n\n29:37.720 --> 29:39.600\n I think that maybe that had been controversial.\n\n29:39.600 --> 29:41.360\n And he's saying like, look, let's face it,\n\n29:41.360 --> 29:44.040\n just because it's not physical doesn't mean it's not there.\n\n29:44.040 --> 29:46.000\n It doesn't mean we shouldn't study it.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:46.920\n Interesting.\n\n29:46.920 --> 29:49.760\n He wasn't jumping to the physical interpretation.\n\n29:49.760 --> 29:51.640\n Like it can be real,\n\n29:51.640 --> 29:55.720\n even if it's not perceivable to the human cognition.\n\n29:55.720 --> 29:56.880\n I think that's right.\n\n29:56.880 --> 29:58.400\n I think, don't get me wrong,\n\n29:58.400 --> 30:00.280\n Poincare never strays far from physics.\n\n30:00.280 --> 30:02.120\n He's always motivated by physics,\n\n30:02.120 --> 30:06.200\n but the physics drove him to need to think about spaces\n\n30:06.200 --> 30:07.240\n of higher dimension.\n\n30:07.240 --> 30:09.440\n And so he needed a formalism that was rich enough\n\n30:09.440 --> 30:10.520\n to enable him to do that.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:11.560\n And once you do that,\n\n30:11.560 --> 30:13.600\n that formalism is also gonna include things\n\n30:13.600 --> 30:14.680\n that are not physical.\n\n30:14.680 --> 30:15.600\n And then you have two choices.\n\n30:15.600 --> 30:17.760\n You can be like, oh, well, that stuff's trash.\n\n30:17.760 --> 30:21.320\n Or, and this is more of the mathematicians frame of mind,\n\n30:21.320 --> 30:23.680\n if you have a formalistic framework\n\n30:23.680 --> 30:24.920\n that like seems really good\n\n30:24.920 --> 30:27.200\n and sort of seems to be like very elegant and work well,\n\n30:27.200 --> 30:29.040\n and it includes all the physical stuff,\n\n30:29.040 --> 30:30.560\n maybe we should think about all of it.\n\n30:30.560 --> 30:31.400\n Like maybe we should think about it,\n\n30:31.400 --> 30:34.520\n thinking maybe there's some gold to be mined there.\n\n30:34.520 --> 30:36.640\n And indeed, like, you know, guess what?\n\n30:36.640 --> 30:39.120\n Like before long there's relativity and there's space time.\n\n30:39.120 --> 30:40.080\n And like all of a sudden it's like,\n\n30:40.080 --> 30:41.560\n oh yeah, maybe it's a good idea.\n\n30:41.560 --> 30:43.880\n We already had this geometric apparatus like set up\n\n30:43.880 --> 30:47.240\n for like how to think about four dimensional spaces,\n\n30:47.240 --> 30:48.600\n like turns out they're real after all.\n\n30:48.600 --> 30:51.680\n As I said, you know, this is a story much told\n\n30:51.680 --> 30:53.080\n right in mathematics, not just in this context,\n\n30:53.080 --> 30:53.920\n but in many.\n\n30:53.920 --> 30:55.640\n I'd love to dig in a little deeper on that actually,\n\n30:55.640 --> 31:00.640\n cause I have some intuitions to work out.\n\n31:00.800 --> 31:01.800\n Okay.\n\n31:01.800 --> 31:02.640\n My brain.\n\n31:02.640 --> 31:03.560\n Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist,\n\n31:03.560 --> 31:05.600\n so we can work them out together.\n\n31:05.600 --> 31:06.440\n Good.\n\n31:06.440 --> 31:10.000\n We'll together walk along the path of curiosity,\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:13.720\n but Poincare conjecture.\n\n31:13.720 --> 31:14.560\n What is it?\n\n31:14.560 --> 31:17.320\n The Poincare conjecture is about curved\n\n31:17.320 --> 31:18.880\n three dimensional spaces.\n\n31:18.880 --> 31:21.240\n So I was on my way there.\n\n31:21.240 --> 31:22.080\n I promise.\n\n31:23.360 --> 31:26.700\n The idea is that we perceive ourselves as living in,\n\n31:27.580 --> 31:29.160\n we don't say a three dimensional space.\n\n31:29.160 --> 31:30.280\n We just say three dimensional space.\n\n31:30.280 --> 31:31.480\n You know, you can go up and down,\n\n31:31.480 --> 31:32.320\n you can go left and right,\n\n31:32.320 --> 31:33.200\n you can go forward and back.\n\n31:33.200 --> 31:35.480\n There's three dimensions in which we can move.\n\n31:35.480 --> 31:36.600\n In Poincare's theory,\n\n31:36.600 --> 31:41.600\n there are many possible three dimensional spaces.\n\n31:41.680 --> 31:45.320\n In the same way that going down one dimension\n\n31:45.320 --> 31:48.420\n to sort of capture our intuition a little bit more,\n\n31:48.420 --> 31:49.700\n we know there are lots of different\n\n31:49.700 --> 31:51.080\n two dimensional surfaces, right?\n\n31:51.080 --> 31:54.080\n There's a balloon and that looks one way\n\n31:54.080 --> 31:55.520\n and a donut looks another way\n\n31:55.520 --> 31:57.640\n and a Mobius strip looks a third way.\n\n31:57.640 --> 31:59.120\n Those are all like two dimensional surfaces\n\n31:59.120 --> 32:02.360\n that we can kind of really get a global view of\n\n32:02.360 --> 32:03.900\n because we live in three dimensional space.\n\n32:03.900 --> 32:05.500\n So we can see a two dimensional surface\n\n32:05.500 --> 32:07.200\n sort of sitting in our three dimensional space.\n\n32:07.200 --> 32:11.260\n Well, to see a three dimensional space whole,\n\n32:11.260 --> 32:13.220\n we'd have to kind of have four dimensional eyes, right?\n\n32:13.220 --> 32:14.060\n Which we don't.\n\n32:14.060 --> 32:15.020\n So we have to use our mathematical eyes.\n\n32:15.020 --> 32:16.020\n We have to envision.\n\n32:17.440 --> 32:22.080\n The Poincare conjecture says that there's a very simple way\n\n32:22.080 --> 32:24.480\n to determine whether a three dimensional space\n\n32:26.480 --> 32:29.640\n is the standard one, the one that we're used to.\n\n32:29.640 --> 32:31.880\n And essentially it's that it's what's called\n\n32:31.880 --> 32:34.640\n fundamental group has nothing interesting in it.\n\n32:34.640 --> 32:36.040\n And that I can actually say without saying\n\n32:36.040 --> 32:36.960\n what the fundamental group is,\n\n32:36.960 --> 32:39.000\n I can tell you what the criterion is.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:39.840\n This would be good.\n\n32:39.840 --> 32:40.880\n Oh, look, I can even use a visual aid.\n\n32:40.880 --> 32:42.360\n So for the people watching this on YouTube,\n\n32:42.360 --> 32:45.240\n you will just see this for the people on the podcast,\n\n32:45.240 --> 32:46.160\n you'll have to visualize it.\n\n32:46.160 --> 32:49.120\n So Lex has been nice enough to like give me a surface\n\n32:49.120 --> 32:50.400\n with an interesting topology.\n\n32:50.400 --> 32:52.320\n It's a mug right here in front of me.\n\n32:52.320 --> 32:53.360\n A mug, yes.\n\n32:53.360 --> 32:55.140\n I might say it's a genus one surface,\n\n32:55.140 --> 32:57.280\n but we could also say it's a mug, same thing.\n\n32:58.580 --> 33:03.000\n So if I were to draw a little circle on this mug,\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.360\n which way should I draw it so it's visible?\n\n33:04.360 --> 33:06.280\n Like here, okay.\n\n33:06.280 --> 33:07.520\n If I draw a little circle on this mug,\n\n33:07.520 --> 33:09.380\n imagine this to be a loop of string.\n\n33:09.380 --> 33:12.080\n I could pull that loop of string closed\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:14.640\n on the surface of the mug, right?\n\n33:14.640 --> 33:15.880\n That's definitely something I could do.\n\n33:15.880 --> 33:18.360\n I could shrink it, shrink it, shrink it until it's a point.\n\n33:18.360 --> 33:19.200\n On the other hand,\n\n33:19.200 --> 33:21.840\n if I draw a loop that goes around the handle,\n\n33:21.840 --> 33:23.100\n I can kind of zhuzh it up here\n\n33:23.100 --> 33:24.040\n and I can zhuzh it down there\n\n33:24.040 --> 33:25.640\n and I can sort of slide it up and down the handle,\n\n33:25.640 --> 33:27.300\n but I can't pull it closed, can I?\n\n33:27.300 --> 33:28.840\n It's trapped.\n\n33:28.840 --> 33:30.680\n Not without breaking the surface of the mug, right?\n\n33:30.680 --> 33:32.380\n Not without like going inside.\n\n33:32.380 --> 33:37.160\n So the condition of being what's called simply connected,\n\n33:37.160 --> 33:39.840\n this is one of Poincare's inventions,\n\n33:39.840 --> 33:42.640\n says that any loop of string can be pulled shut.\n\n33:42.640 --> 33:45.120\n So it's a feature that the mug simply does not have.\n\n33:45.120 --> 33:48.540\n This is a non simply connected mug\n\n33:48.540 --> 33:51.120\n and a simply connected mug would be a cup, right?\n\n33:51.120 --> 33:53.600\n You would burn your hand when you drank coffee out of it.\n\n33:53.600 --> 33:56.520\n So you're saying the universe is not a mug.\n\n33:56.520 --> 33:59.360\n Well, I can't speak to the universe,\n\n33:59.360 --> 34:04.360\n but what I can say is that regular old space is not a mug.\n\n34:05.320 --> 34:06.160\n Regular old space,\n\n34:06.160 --> 34:07.840\n if you like sort of actually physically have\n\n34:07.840 --> 34:09.600\n like a loop of string,\n\n34:09.600 --> 34:11.000\n you can pull it shut.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.660\n You can always pull it shut.\n\n34:12.660 --> 34:14.060\n But what if your piece of string\n\n34:14.060 --> 34:14.980\n was the size of the universe?\n\n34:14.980 --> 34:16.340\n Like what if your piece of string\n\n34:16.340 --> 34:18.120\n was like billions of light years long?\n\n34:18.120 --> 34:20.180\n Like how do you actually know?\n\n34:20.180 --> 34:21.480\n I mean, that's still an open question\n\n34:21.480 --> 34:22.560\n of the shape of the universe.\n\n34:22.560 --> 34:23.400\n Exactly.\n\n34:25.520 --> 34:26.480\n I think there's a lot,\n\n34:26.480 --> 34:28.620\n there is ideas of it being a torus.\n\n34:28.620 --> 34:30.400\n I mean, there's some trippy ideas\n\n34:30.400 --> 34:33.440\n and they're not like weird out there controversial.\n\n34:33.440 --> 34:38.160\n There's legitimate at the center of a cosmology debate.\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:40.000\n I mean, I think most people think it's flat.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.160\n I think there's some kind of dodecahedral symmetry\n\n34:42.160 --> 34:43.600\n or I mean, I remember reading something crazy\n\n34:43.600 --> 34:45.920\n about somebody saying that they saw the signature of that\n\n34:45.920 --> 34:48.520\n in the cosmic noise or what have you.\n\n34:48.520 --> 34:49.800\n I mean.\n\n34:49.800 --> 34:51.380\n To make the flat earthers happy,\n\n34:51.380 --> 34:56.380\n I do believe that the current main belief is it's flat.\n\n34:56.380 --> 34:59.820\n It's flat ish or something like that.\n\n34:59.820 --> 35:01.980\n The shape of the universe is flat ish.\n\n35:01.980 --> 35:03.140\n I don't know what the heck that means.\n\n35:03.140 --> 35:05.700\n I think that has like a very,\n\n35:06.660 --> 35:09.900\n how are you even supposed to think about the shape\n\n35:09.900 --> 35:14.140\n of a thing that doesn't have any thing outside of it?\n\n35:14.140 --> 35:14.980\n I mean.\n\n35:14.980 --> 35:16.740\n Ah, but that's exactly what topology does.\n\n35:16.740 --> 35:19.420\n Topology is what's called an intrinsic theory.\n\n35:19.420 --> 35:20.340\n That's what's so great about it.\n\n35:20.340 --> 35:22.580\n This question about the mug,\n\n35:22.580 --> 35:26.000\n you could answer it without ever leaving the mug, right?\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.980\n Because it's a question about a loop drawn\n\n35:28.980 --> 35:29.980\n on the surface of the mug\n\n35:29.980 --> 35:31.820\n and what happens if it never leaves that surface.\n\n35:31.820 --> 35:33.500\n So it's like always there.\n\n35:33.500 --> 35:37.820\n See, but that's the difference between the topology\n\n35:37.820 --> 35:42.480\n and say, if you're like trying to visualize a mug,\n\n35:42.480 --> 35:45.580\n that you can't visualize a mug while living inside the mug.\n\n35:46.660 --> 35:47.500\n Well, that's true.\n\n35:47.500 --> 35:49.180\n The visualization is harder, but in some sense,\n\n35:49.180 --> 35:50.000\n no, you're right.\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:51.980\n But if the tools of mathematics are there,\n\n35:51.980 --> 35:53.700\n I, sorry, I don't want to fight,\n\n35:53.700 --> 35:55.580\n but I think the tools of mathematics are exactly there\n\n35:55.580 --> 35:56.980\n to enable you to think about\n\n35:56.980 --> 35:58.700\n what you cannot visualize in this way.\n\n35:58.700 --> 36:00.740\n Let me give, let's go, always to make things easier,\n\n36:00.740 --> 36:01.780\n go down to dimension.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.780\n Let's think about we live in a circle, okay?\n\n36:05.780 --> 36:10.780\n You can tell whether you live on a circle or a line segment,\n\n36:11.260 --> 36:12.340\n because if you live in a circle,\n\n36:12.340 --> 36:13.800\n if you walk a long way in one direction,\n\n36:13.800 --> 36:15.220\n you find yourself back where you started.\n\n36:15.220 --> 36:17.300\n And if you live in a line segment,\n\n36:17.300 --> 36:18.740\n you walk for a long enough one direction,\n\n36:18.740 --> 36:20.180\n you come to the end of the world.\n\n36:20.180 --> 36:22.900\n Or if you live on a line, like a whole line,\n\n36:22.900 --> 36:25.860\n infinite line, then you walk in one direction\n\n36:25.860 --> 36:27.080\n for a long time and like,\n\n36:27.080 --> 36:28.720\n well, then there's not a sort of terminating algorithm\n\n36:28.720 --> 36:30.460\n to figure out whether you live on a line or a circle,\n\n36:30.460 --> 36:31.660\n but at least you sort of,\n\n36:33.340 --> 36:35.680\n at least you don't discover that you live on a circle.\n\n36:35.680 --> 36:37.360\n So all of those are intrinsic things, right?\n\n36:37.360 --> 36:39.700\n All of those are things that you can figure out\n\n36:39.700 --> 36:42.060\n about your world without leaving your world.\n\n36:42.060 --> 36:43.300\n On the other hand, ready?\n\n36:43.300 --> 36:45.220\n Now we're going to go from intrinsic to extrinsic.\n\n36:45.220 --> 36:46.920\n Boy, did I not know we were going to talk about this,\n\n36:46.920 --> 36:48.020\n but why not?\n\n36:48.020 --> 36:48.860\n Why not?\n\n36:48.860 --> 36:52.500\n If you can't tell whether you live in a circle\n\n36:52.500 --> 36:55.580\n or a knot, like imagine like a knot\n\n36:55.580 --> 36:56.900\n floating in three dimensional space.\n\n36:56.900 --> 36:59.660\n The person who lives on that knot, to them it's a circle.\n\n36:59.660 --> 37:01.740\n They walk a long way, they come back to where they started.\n\n37:01.740 --> 37:04.280\n Now we, with our three dimensional eyes can be like,\n\n37:04.280 --> 37:05.580\n oh, this one's just a plain circle\n\n37:05.580 --> 37:06.700\n and this one's knotted up,\n\n37:06.700 --> 37:09.700\n but that has to do with how they sit\n\n37:09.700 --> 37:10.620\n in three dimensional space.\n\n37:10.620 --> 37:12.120\n It doesn't have to do with intrinsic features\n\n37:12.120 --> 37:13.120\n of those people's world.\n\n37:13.120 --> 37:14.880\n We can ask you one ape to another.\n\n37:14.880 --> 37:17.120\n Does it make you, how does it make you feel\n\n37:17.120 --> 37:19.860\n that you don't know if you live in a circle\n\n37:19.860 --> 37:22.740\n or on a knot, in a knot,\n\n37:24.460 --> 37:26.760\n inside the string that forms the knot?\n\n37:28.680 --> 37:29.940\n I don't even know how to say that.\n\n37:29.940 --> 37:30.940\n I'm going to be honest with you.\n\n37:30.940 --> 37:34.580\n I don't know if, I fear you won't like this answer,\n\n37:34.580 --> 37:37.140\n but it does not bother me at all.\n\n37:37.140 --> 37:39.380\n I don't lose one minute of sleep over it.\n\n37:39.380 --> 37:41.700\n So like, does it bother you that if we look\n\n37:41.700 --> 37:46.100\n at like a Mobius strip, that you don't have an obvious way\n\n37:46.100 --> 37:49.740\n of knowing whether you are inside of a cylinder,\n\n37:49.740 --> 37:51.780\n if you live on a surface of a cylinder\n\n37:51.780 --> 37:54.020\n or you live on the surface of a Mobius strip?\n\n37:55.700 --> 37:58.740\n No, I think you can tell if you live.\n\n37:58.740 --> 37:59.580\n Which one?\n\n37:59.580 --> 38:02.500\n Because what you do is you like tell your friend,\n\n38:02.500 --> 38:04.140\n hey, stay right here, I'm just going to go for a walk.\n\n38:04.140 --> 38:06.700\n And then you like walk for a long time in one direction\n\n38:06.700 --> 38:08.260\n and then you come back and you see your friend again.\n\n38:08.260 --> 38:09.380\n And if your friend is reversed,\n\n38:09.380 --> 38:10.740\n then you know you live on a Mobius strip.\n\n38:10.740 --> 38:13.860\n Well, no, because you won't see your friend, right?\n\n38:13.860 --> 38:17.060\n Okay, fair point, fair point on that.\n\n38:17.060 --> 38:19.820\n But you have to believe the stories about,\n\n38:19.820 --> 38:24.220\n no, I don't even know, would you even know?\n\n38:24.220 --> 38:25.100\n Would you really?\n\n38:25.100 --> 38:26.860\n Oh, no, your point is right.\n\n38:26.860 --> 38:28.220\n Let me try to think of a better,\n\n38:28.220 --> 38:29.420\n let's see if I can do this on the fly.\n\n38:29.420 --> 38:33.900\n It may not be correct to talk about cognitive beings\n\n38:33.900 --> 38:35.380\n living on a Mobius strip\n\n38:35.380 --> 38:37.940\n because there's a lot of things taken for granted there.\n\n38:37.940 --> 38:39.820\n And we're constantly imagining actual\n\n38:39.820 --> 38:42.300\n like three dimensional creatures,\n\n38:42.300 --> 38:47.300\n like how it actually feels like to live in a Mobius strip\n\n38:47.940 --> 38:50.140\n is tricky to internalize.\n\n38:50.140 --> 38:52.860\n I think that on what's called the real protective plane,\n\n38:52.860 --> 38:54.900\n which is kind of even more sort of like messed up version\n\n38:54.900 --> 38:57.540\n of the Mobius strip, but with very similar features,\n\n38:57.540 --> 39:01.340\n this feature of kind of like only having one side,\n\n39:01.340 --> 39:04.500\n that has the feature that there's a loop of string\n\n39:04.500 --> 39:06.740\n which can't be pulled closed.\n\n39:06.740 --> 39:09.700\n But if you loop it around twice along the same path,\n\n39:09.700 --> 39:11.300\n that you can pull closed.\n\n39:11.300 --> 39:12.980\n That's extremely weird.\n\n39:12.980 --> 39:13.820\n Yeah.\n\n39:14.860 --> 39:16.260\n But that would be a way you could know\n\n39:16.260 --> 39:17.260\n without leaving your world\n\n39:17.260 --> 39:20.380\n that something very funny is going on.\n\n39:20.380 --> 39:21.980\n You know what's extremely weird?\n\n39:21.980 --> 39:23.260\n Maybe we can comment on,\n\n39:23.260 --> 39:25.460\n hopefully it's not too much of a tangent is,\n\n39:26.900 --> 39:29.020\n I remember thinking about this,\n\n39:29.020 --> 39:31.820\n this might be right, this might be wrong.\n\n39:31.820 --> 39:34.580\n But if we now talk about a sphere\n\n39:35.460 --> 39:37.580\n and you're living inside a sphere,\n\n39:37.580 --> 39:41.180\n that you're going to see everywhere around you,\n\n39:41.180 --> 39:42.660\n the back of your own head.\n\n39:44.820 --> 39:46.140\n That I was,\n\n39:46.140 --> 39:47.980\n cause like I was,\n\n39:47.980 --> 39:50.820\n this is very counterintuitive to me to think about,\n\n39:50.820 --> 39:51.660\n maybe it's wrong.\n\n39:51.660 --> 39:54.260\n But cause I was thinking of like earth,\n\n39:54.260 --> 39:57.260\n your 3D thing sitting on a sphere.\n\n39:57.260 --> 39:59.260\n But if you're living inside the sphere,\n\n40:00.140 --> 40:02.300\n like you're going to see, if you look straight,\n\n40:02.300 --> 40:05.580\n you're always going to see yourself all the way around.\n\n40:05.580 --> 40:07.620\n So everywhere you look, there's going to be\n\n40:07.620 --> 40:09.300\n the back of your own head.\n\n40:09.300 --> 40:10.980\n I think somehow this depends on something\n\n40:10.980 --> 40:13.180\n of like how the physics of light works in this scenario,\n\n40:13.180 --> 40:14.820\n which I'm sort of finding it hard to bend my.\n\n40:14.820 --> 40:15.660\n That's true.\n\n40:15.660 --> 40:16.660\n The sea is doing a lot of work.\n\n40:16.660 --> 40:19.540\n Like saying you see something is doing a lot of work.\n\n40:19.540 --> 40:20.740\n People have thought about this a lot.\n\n40:20.740 --> 40:22.340\n I mean, this metaphor of like,\n\n40:22.340 --> 40:24.740\n what if we're like little creatures\n\n40:24.740 --> 40:26.100\n in some sort of smaller world?\n\n40:26.100 --> 40:27.700\n Like how could we apprehend what's outside?\n\n40:27.700 --> 40:29.580\n That metaphor just comes back and back.\n\n40:29.580 --> 40:32.140\n And actually I didn't even realize like how frequent it is.\n\n40:32.140 --> 40:33.540\n It comes up in the book a lot.\n\n40:33.540 --> 40:35.620\n I know it from a book called Flatland.\n\n40:35.620 --> 40:37.780\n I don't know if you ever read this when you were a kid.\n\n40:37.780 --> 40:38.620\n A while ago, yeah.\n\n40:38.620 --> 40:39.460\n An adult.\n\n40:39.460 --> 40:42.900\n You know, this sort of comic novel from the 19th century\n\n40:42.900 --> 40:46.940\n about an entire two dimensional world.\n\n40:46.940 --> 40:48.260\n It's narrated by a square.\n\n40:48.260 --> 40:49.820\n That's the main character.\n\n40:49.820 --> 40:53.580\n And the kind of strangeness that befalls him\n\n40:53.580 --> 40:55.220\n when one day he's in his house\n\n40:55.220 --> 40:57.860\n and suddenly there's like a little circle there\n\n40:57.860 --> 40:59.220\n and they're with him.\n\n40:59.220 --> 41:02.460\n But then the circle like starts getting bigger\n\n41:02.460 --> 41:04.340\n and bigger and bigger.\n\n41:04.340 --> 41:06.020\n And he's like, what the hell is going on?\n\n41:06.020 --> 41:08.500\n It's like a horror movie, like for two dimensional people.\n\n41:08.500 --> 41:09.820\n And of course what's happening\n\n41:09.820 --> 41:12.140\n is that a sphere is entering his world.\n\n41:12.140 --> 41:15.060\n And as the sphere kind of like moves farther and farther\n\n41:15.060 --> 41:16.700\n into the plane, it's cross section.\n\n41:16.700 --> 41:18.420\n The part of it that he can see.\n\n41:18.420 --> 41:20.140\n To him, it looks like there's like this kind\n\n41:20.140 --> 41:22.420\n of bizarre being that's like getting larger\n\n41:22.420 --> 41:23.500\n and larger and larger\n\n41:24.700 --> 41:27.300\n until it's exactly sort of halfway through.\n\n41:27.300 --> 41:29.140\n And then they have this kind of like philosophical argument\n\n41:29.140 --> 41:30.180\n where the sphere is like, I'm a sphere.\n\n41:30.180 --> 41:31.020\n I'm from the third dimension.\n\n41:31.020 --> 41:32.220\n The square is like, what are you talking about?\n\n41:32.220 --> 41:33.380\n There's no such thing.\n\n41:33.380 --> 41:36.220\n And they have this kind of like sterile argument\n\n41:36.220 --> 41:39.140\n where the square is not able to kind of like\n\n41:39.140 --> 41:40.980\n follow the mathematical reasoning of the sphere\n\n41:40.980 --> 41:42.380\n until the sphere just kind of grabs him\n\n41:42.380 --> 41:45.820\n and like jerks him out of the plane and pulls him up.\n\n41:45.820 --> 41:47.380\n And it's like now, like now do you see,\n\n41:47.380 --> 41:50.260\n like now do you see your whole world\n\n41:50.260 --> 41:52.100\n that you didn't understand before?\n\n41:52.100 --> 41:55.500\n So do you think that kind of process is possible\n\n41:55.500 --> 41:56.580\n for us humans?\n\n41:56.580 --> 41:58.380\n So we live in the three dimensional world,\n\n41:58.380 --> 42:01.520\n maybe with the time component four dimensional\n\n42:01.520 --> 42:06.520\n and then math allows us to go high,\n\n42:06.620 --> 42:08.220\n into high dimensions comfortably\n\n42:08.220 --> 42:10.460\n and explore the world from those perspectives.\n\n42:13.580 --> 42:18.580\n Like, is it possible that the universe\n\n42:19.620 --> 42:23.060\n is many more dimensions than the ones\n\n42:23.060 --> 42:25.180\n we experience as human beings?\n\n42:25.180 --> 42:28.820\n So if you look at the, you know,\n\n42:28.820 --> 42:32.020\n especially in physics theories of everything,\n\n42:32.020 --> 42:35.380\n physics theories that try to unify general relativity\n\n42:35.380 --> 42:37.400\n and quantum field theory,\n\n42:37.400 --> 42:42.400\n they seem to go to high dimensions to work stuff out\n\n42:42.660 --> 42:44.620\n through the tools of mathematics.\n\n42:44.620 --> 42:46.140\n Is it possible?\n\n42:46.140 --> 42:47.700\n So like the two options are,\n\n42:47.700 --> 42:51.500\n one is just a nice way to analyze a universe,\n\n42:51.500 --> 42:54.740\n but the reality is, is as exactly we perceive it,\n\n42:54.740 --> 42:58.620\n it is three dimensional, or are we just seeing,\n\n42:58.620 --> 43:00.740\n are we those flatland creatures\n\n43:00.740 --> 43:03.740\n that are just seeing a tiny slice of reality\n\n43:03.740 --> 43:08.740\n and the actual reality is many, many, many more dimensions\n\n43:08.860 --> 43:10.960\n than the three dimensions we perceive?\n\n43:10.960 --> 43:12.860\n Oh, I certainly think that's possible.\n\n43:14.580 --> 43:17.900\n Now, how would you figure out whether it was true or not\n\n43:17.900 --> 43:18.960\n is another question.\n\n43:20.440 --> 43:22.180\n And I suppose what you would do\n\n43:22.180 --> 43:25.060\n as with anything else that you can't directly perceive\n\n43:25.060 --> 43:29.380\n is you would try to understand\n\n43:29.380 --> 43:32.100\n what effect the presence of those extra dimensions\n\n43:33.220 --> 43:36.940\n out there would have on the things we can perceive.\n\n43:36.940 --> 43:39.180\n Like what else can you do, right?\n\n43:39.180 --> 43:42.260\n And in some sense, if the answer is\n\n43:42.260 --> 43:44.720\n they would have no effect,\n\n43:44.720 --> 43:46.180\n then maybe it becomes like a little bit\n\n43:46.180 --> 43:47.020\n of a sterile question,\n\n43:47.020 --> 43:49.340\n because what question are you even asking, right?\n\n43:49.340 --> 43:53.740\n You can kind of posit however many entities that you want.\n\n43:53.740 --> 43:56.900\n Is it possible to intuit how to mess\n\n43:56.900 --> 43:58.240\n with the other dimensions\n\n43:58.240 --> 44:00.320\n while living in a three dimensional world?\n\n44:00.320 --> 44:03.020\n I mean, that seems like a very challenging thing to do.\n\n44:03.860 --> 44:06.040\n The reason flatland could be written\n\n44:06.900 --> 44:11.420\n is because it's coming from a three dimensional writer.\n\n44:11.420 --> 44:13.880\n Yes, but what happens in the book,\n\n44:13.880 --> 44:15.220\n I didn't even tell you the whole plot.\n\n44:15.220 --> 44:17.220\n What happens is the square is so excited\n\n44:17.220 --> 44:19.960\n and so filled with intellectual joy.\n\n44:19.960 --> 44:22.200\n By the way, maybe to give the story some context,\n\n44:22.200 --> 44:25.180\n you asked like, is it possible for us humans\n\n44:25.180 --> 44:28.460\n to have this experience of being transcendentally jerked\n\n44:28.460 --> 44:30.980\n out of our world so we can sort of truly see it from above?\n\n44:30.980 --> 44:32.760\n Well, Edwin Abbott who wrote the book\n\n44:32.760 --> 44:35.940\n certainly thought so because Edwin Abbott was a minister.\n\n44:35.940 --> 44:37.880\n So the whole Christian subtext of this book,\n\n44:37.880 --> 44:41.840\n I had completely not grasped reading this as a kid,\n\n44:41.840 --> 44:43.420\n that it means a very different thing, right?\n\n44:43.420 --> 44:45.700\n If sort of a theologian is saying like,\n\n44:45.700 --> 44:48.220\n oh, what if a higher being could like pull you out\n\n44:48.220 --> 44:50.000\n of this earthly world you live in\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:51.360\n so that you can sort of see the truth\n\n44:51.360 --> 44:54.460\n and like really see it from above as it were.\n\n44:54.460 --> 44:56.500\n So that's one of the things that's going on for him.\n\n44:56.500 --> 44:58.420\n And it's a testament to his skill as a writer\n\n44:58.420 --> 45:01.760\n that his story just works whether that's the framework\n\n45:01.760 --> 45:05.220\n you're coming to it from or not.\n\n45:05.220 --> 45:07.500\n But what happens in this book and this part,\n\n45:07.500 --> 45:08.980\n now looking at it through a Christian lens,\n\n45:08.980 --> 45:13.240\n it becomes a bit subversive is the square is so excited\n\n45:13.240 --> 45:16.780\n about what he's learned from the sphere\n\n45:16.780 --> 45:18.740\n and the sphere explains to him like what a cube would be.\n\n45:18.740 --> 45:20.020\n Oh, it's like you but three dimensional\n\n45:20.020 --> 45:21.020\n and the square is very excited\n\n45:21.020 --> 45:23.180\n and the square is like, okay, I get it now.\n\n45:23.180 --> 45:26.060\n So like now that you explained to me how just by reason\n\n45:26.060 --> 45:27.380\n I can figure out what a cube would be like,\n\n45:27.380 --> 45:29.020\n like a three dimensional version of me,\n\n45:29.020 --> 45:31.340\n like let's figure out what a four dimensional version\n\n45:31.340 --> 45:32.740\n of me would be like.\n\n45:32.740 --> 45:33.980\n And then the sphere is like,\n\n45:33.980 --> 45:34.860\n what the hell are you talking about?\n\n45:34.860 --> 45:36.520\n There's no fourth dimension, that's ridiculous.\n\n45:36.520 --> 45:37.740\n Like there's three dimensions,\n\n45:37.740 --> 45:39.300\n like that's how many there are, I can see.\n\n45:39.300 --> 45:40.880\n Like, I mean, it's this sort of comic moment\n\n45:40.880 --> 45:44.660\n where the sphere is completely unable to conceptualize\n\n45:44.660 --> 45:47.940\n that there could actually be yet another dimension.\n\n45:47.940 --> 45:49.900\n So yeah, that takes the religious allegory\n\n45:49.900 --> 45:51.340\n like a very weird place that I don't really\n\n45:51.340 --> 45:53.140\n like understand theologically, but.\n\n45:53.140 --> 45:57.880\n That's a nice way to talk about religion and myth in general\n\n45:57.880 --> 46:00.960\n as perhaps us trying to struggle,\n\n46:00.960 --> 46:03.860\n us meaning human civilization, trying to struggle\n\n46:03.860 --> 46:08.620\n with ideas that are beyond our cognitive capabilities.\n\n46:08.620 --> 46:10.620\n But it's in fact not beyond our capability.\n\n46:10.620 --> 46:13.300\n It may be beyond our cognitive capabilities\n\n46:13.300 --> 46:16.460\n to visualize a four dimensional cube,\n\n46:16.460 --> 46:18.320\n a tesseract as some like to call it,\n\n46:18.320 --> 46:20.800\n or a five dimensional cube, or a six dimensional cube,\n\n46:20.800 --> 46:23.940\n but it is not beyond our cognitive capabilities\n\n46:23.940 --> 46:26.640\n to figure out how many corners\n\n46:26.640 --> 46:28.040\n a six dimensional cube would have.\n\n46:28.040 --> 46:29.380\n That's what's so cool about us.\n\n46:29.380 --> 46:31.060\n Whether we can visualize it or not,\n\n46:31.060 --> 46:33.400\n we can still talk about it, we can still reason about it,\n\n46:33.400 --> 46:36.160\n we can still figure things out about it.\n\n46:36.160 --> 46:37.260\n That's amazing.\n\n46:37.260 --> 46:41.620\n Yeah, if we go back to this, first of all, to the mug,\n\n46:41.620 --> 46:44.980\n but to the example you give in the book of the straw,\n\n46:44.980 --> 46:49.800\n how many holes does a straw have?\n\n46:49.800 --> 46:54.140\n And you, listener, may try to answer that in your own head.\n\n46:54.140 --> 46:56.220\n Yeah, I'm gonna take a drink while everybody thinks about it\n\n46:56.220 --> 46:57.060\n so we can give you a moment.\n\n46:57.060 --> 46:59.020\n A slow sip.\n\n46:59.020 --> 47:04.020\n Is it zero, one, or two, or more than that maybe?\n\n47:04.900 --> 47:06.660\n Maybe you can get very creative.\n\n47:06.660 --> 47:10.640\n But it's kind of interesting to each,\n\n47:10.640 --> 47:13.100\n dissecting each answer as you do in the book\n\n47:13.100 --> 47:14.140\n is quite brilliant.\n\n47:14.140 --> 47:15.540\n People should definitely check it out.\n\n47:15.540 --> 47:18.420\n But if you could try to answer it now,\n\n47:18.420 --> 47:20.300\n think about all the options\n\n47:21.220 --> 47:23.420\n and why they may or may not be right.\n\n47:23.420 --> 47:25.260\n Yeah, and it's one of these questions\n\n47:25.260 --> 47:28.300\n where people on first hearing it think it's a triviality\n\n47:28.300 --> 47:29.780\n and they're like, well, the answer is obvious.\n\n47:29.780 --> 47:31.380\n And then what happens if you ever ask a group of people\n\n47:31.380 --> 47:33.960\n that something wonderfully comic happens,\n\n47:33.960 --> 47:34.800\n which is that everyone's like,\n\n47:34.800 --> 47:36.500\n well, it's completely obvious.\n\n47:36.500 --> 47:38.980\n And then each person realizes that half the person,\n\n47:38.980 --> 47:39.820\n the other people in the room\n\n47:39.820 --> 47:42.940\n have a different obvious answer for the way they have.\n\n47:42.940 --> 47:44.420\n And then people get really heated.\n\n47:44.420 --> 47:46.100\n People are like, I can't believe\n\n47:46.100 --> 47:47.440\n that you think it has two holes\n\n47:47.440 --> 47:49.660\n or like, I can't believe that you think it has one.\n\n47:49.660 --> 47:50.580\n And then, you know, you really,\n\n47:50.580 --> 47:52.420\n like people really learn something about each other\n\n47:52.420 --> 47:54.440\n and people get heated.\n\n47:54.440 --> 47:57.700\n I mean, can we go through the possible options here?\n\n47:57.700 --> 48:01.300\n Is it zero, one, two, three, 10?\n\n48:01.300 --> 48:04.660\n Sure, so I think, you know, most people,\n\n48:04.660 --> 48:06.100\n the zero holders are rare.\n\n48:06.100 --> 48:07.740\n They would say like, well, look,\n\n48:07.740 --> 48:10.180\n you can make a straw by taking a rectangular piece of plastic\n\n48:10.180 --> 48:11.020\n and closing it up.\n\n48:11.020 --> 48:13.820\n A rectangular piece of plastic doesn't have a hole in it.\n\n48:14.820 --> 48:16.980\n I didn't poke a hole in it when I,\n\n48:16.980 --> 48:18.320\n so how can I have a hole?\n\n48:18.320 --> 48:19.580\n They'd be like, it's just one thing.\n\n48:19.580 --> 48:21.940\n Okay, most people don't see it that way.\n\n48:21.940 --> 48:23.820\n That's like a...\n\n48:23.820 --> 48:25.900\n Is there any truth to that kind of conception?\n\n48:25.900 --> 48:28.960\n Yeah, I think that would be somebody who's account, I mean,\n\n48:33.740 --> 48:37.340\n what I would say is you could say the same thing\n\n48:39.420 --> 48:40.460\n about a bagel.\n\n48:40.460 --> 48:43.100\n You could say, I can make a bagel by taking like a long\n\n48:43.100 --> 48:45.060\n cylinder of dough, which doesn't have a hole\n\n48:45.060 --> 48:47.720\n and then schmushing the ends together.\n\n48:47.720 --> 48:49.060\n Now it's a bagel.\n\n48:49.060 --> 48:50.580\n So if you're really committed, you can be like, okay,\n\n48:50.580 --> 48:51.700\n a bagel doesn't have a hole either.\n\n48:51.700 --> 48:54.100\n But like, who are you if you say a bagel doesn't have a hole?\n\n48:54.100 --> 48:54.940\n I mean, I don't know.\n\n48:54.940 --> 48:57.980\n Yeah, so that's almost like an engineering definition of it.\n\n48:57.980 --> 48:59.000\n Okay, fair enough.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.240\n So what about the other options?\n\n49:02.240 --> 49:06.620\n So, you know, one whole people would say...\n\n49:07.740 --> 49:09.900\n I like how these are like groups of people.\n\n49:09.900 --> 49:12.940\n Like we've planted our foot, this is what we stand for.\n\n49:12.940 --> 49:16.260\n There's books written about each belief.\n\n49:16.260 --> 49:17.580\n You know, I would say, look, there's like a hole\n\n49:17.580 --> 49:19.140\n and it goes all the way through the straw, right?\n\n49:19.140 --> 49:21.900\n It's one region of space, that's the hole.\n\n49:21.900 --> 49:22.740\n And there's one.\n\n49:22.740 --> 49:24.140\n And two whole people would say like, well, look,\n\n49:24.140 --> 49:27.340\n there's a hole in the top and a hole at the bottom.\n\n49:28.420 --> 49:31.540\n I think a common thing you see when people\n\n49:34.020 --> 49:35.960\n argue about this, they would take something like this\n\n49:35.960 --> 49:40.260\n bottle of water I'm holding and go open it and they say,\n\n49:40.260 --> 49:41.540\n well, how many holes are there in this?\n\n49:41.540 --> 49:44.100\n And you say like, well, there's one hole at the top.\n\n49:44.100 --> 49:46.380\n Okay, what if I like poke a hole here\n\n49:46.380 --> 49:48.940\n so that all the water spills out?\n\n49:48.940 --> 49:50.860\n Well, now it's a straw.\n\n49:50.860 --> 49:51.700\n Yeah.\n\n49:51.700 --> 49:53.140\n So if you're a one holder, I say to you like,\n\n49:53.140 --> 49:56.020\n well, how many holes are in it now?\n\n49:56.020 --> 49:57.340\n There was one hole in it before\n\n49:57.340 --> 49:59.280\n and I poked a new hole in it.\n\n49:59.280 --> 50:01.580\n And then you think there's still one hole\n\n50:01.580 --> 50:04.700\n even though there was one hole and I made one more?\n\n50:04.700 --> 50:06.740\n Clearly not, this is two holes.\n\n50:06.740 --> 50:08.180\n Yeah.\n\n50:08.180 --> 50:10.380\n And yet if you're a two holder, the one holder will say like,\n\n50:10.380 --> 50:13.220\n okay, where does one hole begin and the other hole end?\n\n50:13.220 --> 50:14.060\n Yeah.\n\n50:16.340 --> 50:18.660\n And in the book, I sort of, you know, in math,\n\n50:18.660 --> 50:20.380\n there's two things we do when we're faced with a problem\n\n50:20.380 --> 50:21.460\n that's confusing us.\n\n50:22.940 --> 50:24.540\n We can make the problem simpler.\n\n50:24.540 --> 50:25.740\n That's what we were doing a minute ago\n\n50:25.740 --> 50:27.100\n when we were talking about high dimensional space.\n\n50:27.100 --> 50:28.500\n And I was like, let's talk about like circles\n\n50:28.500 --> 50:29.340\n and line segments.\n\n50:29.340 --> 50:31.740\n Let's like go down a dimension to make it easier.\n\n50:31.740 --> 50:35.100\n The other big move we have is to make the problem harder\n\n50:35.100 --> 50:36.700\n and try to sort of really like face up\n\n50:36.700 --> 50:37.660\n to what are the complications.\n\n50:37.660 --> 50:39.580\n So, you know, what I do in the book is say like,\n\n50:39.580 --> 50:41.220\n let's stop talking about straws for a minute\n\n50:41.220 --> 50:42.860\n and talk about pants.\n\n50:42.860 --> 50:46.220\n How many holes are there in a pair of pants?\n\n50:46.220 --> 50:48.820\n So I think most people who say there's two holes in a straw\n\n50:48.820 --> 50:51.980\n would say there's three holes in a pair of pants.\n\n50:51.980 --> 50:54.020\n I guess, I mean, I guess we're filming only from here.\n\n50:54.020 --> 50:56.580\n I could take up, no, I'm not gonna do it.\n\n50:56.580 --> 50:58.300\n You'll just have to imagine the pants, sorry.\n\n50:58.300 --> 50:59.700\n Yeah.\n\n50:59.700 --> 51:01.220\n Lex, if you want to, no, okay, no.\n\n51:01.220 --> 51:04.580\n That's gonna be in the director's cut.\n\n51:04.580 --> 51:06.380\n That's that Patreon only footage.\n\n51:06.380 --> 51:07.820\n There you go.\n\n51:07.820 --> 51:09.500\n So many people would say there's three holes\n\n51:09.500 --> 51:10.340\n in a pair of pants.\n\n51:10.340 --> 51:11.980\n But you know, for instance, my daughter, when I asked,\n\n51:11.980 --> 51:14.860\n by the way, talking to kids about this is super fun.\n\n51:14.860 --> 51:16.380\n I highly recommend it.\n\n51:16.380 --> 51:17.900\n What did she say?\n\n51:17.900 --> 51:21.020\n She said, well, yeah, I feel a pair of pants\n\n51:21.020 --> 51:23.660\n like just has two holes because yes, there's the waist,\n\n51:23.660 --> 51:26.620\n but that's just the two leg holes stuck together.\n\n51:26.620 --> 51:28.500\n Whoa, okay.\n\n51:28.500 --> 51:29.860\n Two leg holes, yeah, okay.\n\n51:29.860 --> 51:31.420\n I mean, that really is a good combination.\n\n51:31.420 --> 51:32.340\n So she's a one holder for the straw.\n\n51:32.340 --> 51:34.460\n So she's a one holder for the straw too.\n\n51:34.460 --> 51:39.460\n And that really does capture something.\n\n51:39.580 --> 51:42.860\n It captures this fact, which is central\n\n51:42.860 --> 51:44.420\n to the theory of what's called homology,\n\n51:44.420 --> 51:46.060\n which is like a central part of modern topology\n\n51:46.060 --> 51:49.700\n that holes, whatever we may mean by them,\n\n51:49.700 --> 51:51.980\n they're somehow things which have an arithmetic to them.\n\n51:51.980 --> 51:53.940\n They're things which can be added.\n\n51:53.940 --> 51:57.180\n Like the waist, like waist equals leg plus leg\n\n51:57.180 --> 51:58.420\n is kind of an equation,\n\n51:58.420 --> 52:00.100\n but it's not an equation about numbers.\n\n52:00.100 --> 52:02.900\n It's an equation about some kind of geometric,\n\n52:02.900 --> 52:05.420\n some kind of topological thing, which is very strange.\n\n52:05.420 --> 52:09.220\n And so, you know, when I come down, you know,\n\n52:09.220 --> 52:11.500\n like a rabbi, I like to kind of like come up\n\n52:11.500 --> 52:13.340\n with these answers and somehow like dodge\n\n52:13.340 --> 52:14.740\n the original question and say like,\n\n52:14.740 --> 52:15.860\n you're both right, my children.\n\n52:15.860 --> 52:17.260\n Okay, so.\n\n52:17.260 --> 52:18.100\n Yeah.\n\n52:19.140 --> 52:23.460\n So for the straw, I think what a modern mathematician\n\n52:23.460 --> 52:27.980\n would say is like, the first version would be to say like,\n\n52:27.980 --> 52:29.260\n well, there are two holes,\n\n52:29.260 --> 52:31.340\n but they're really both the same hole.\n\n52:31.340 --> 52:32.260\n Well, that's not quite right.\n\n52:32.260 --> 52:34.740\n A better way to say it is there's two holes,\n\n52:34.740 --> 52:37.500\n but one is the negative of the other.\n\n52:37.500 --> 52:38.700\n Now, what can that mean?\n\n52:39.860 --> 52:41.420\n One way of thinking about what it means is that\n\n52:41.420 --> 52:44.620\n if you sip something like a milkshake through the straw,\n\n52:44.620 --> 52:48.100\n no matter what, the amount of milkshake\n\n52:48.100 --> 52:49.940\n that's flowing in one end,\n\n52:49.940 --> 52:53.380\n that same amount is flowing out the other end.\n\n52:53.380 --> 52:55.780\n So they're not independent from each other.\n\n52:55.780 --> 52:57.660\n There's some relationship between them.\n\n52:57.660 --> 53:00.780\n In the same way that if you somehow\n\n53:00.780 --> 53:04.100\n could like suck a milkshake through a pair of pants,\n\n53:05.140 --> 53:06.580\n the amount of milkshake,\n\n53:06.580 --> 53:08.860\n just go with me on this thought experiment.\n\n53:08.860 --> 53:09.700\n I'm right there with you.\n\n53:09.700 --> 53:11.660\n The amount of milkshake that's coming in\n\n53:11.660 --> 53:13.300\n the left leg of the pants,\n\n53:13.300 --> 53:15.060\n plus the amount of milkshake that's coming in\n\n53:15.060 --> 53:16.620\n the right leg of the pants,\n\n53:16.620 --> 53:20.740\n is the same that's coming out the waist of the pants.\n\n53:20.740 --> 53:23.260\n So just so you know, I fasted for 72 hours\n\n53:24.140 --> 53:25.540\n the last three days.\n\n53:25.540 --> 53:27.740\n So I just broke the fast with a little bit of food yesterday.\n\n53:27.740 --> 53:32.060\n So this sounds, food analogies or metaphors\n\n53:32.060 --> 53:33.740\n for this podcast work wonderfully\n\n53:33.740 --> 53:35.740\n because I can intensely picture it.\n\n53:35.740 --> 53:37.860\n Is that your weekly routine or just in preparation\n\n53:37.860 --> 53:39.460\n for talking about geometry for three hours?\n\n53:39.460 --> 53:41.900\n Exactly, this is just for this.\n\n53:41.900 --> 53:44.100\n It's hardship to purify the mind.\n\n53:44.100 --> 53:45.180\n No, it's for the first time,\n\n53:45.180 --> 53:46.660\n I just wanted to try the experience.\n\n53:46.660 --> 53:47.500\n Oh, wow.\n\n53:47.500 --> 53:50.060\n And just to pause,\n\n53:50.060 --> 53:52.060\n to do things that are out of the ordinary,\n\n53:52.060 --> 53:55.980\n to pause and to reflect on how grateful I am\n\n53:55.980 --> 53:59.220\n to be just alive and be able to do all the cool shit\n\n53:59.220 --> 54:00.220\n that I get to do, so.\n\n54:00.220 --> 54:01.340\n Did you drink water?\n\n54:01.340 --> 54:03.060\n Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n54:03.060 --> 54:05.740\n Water and salt, so like electrolytes\n\n54:05.740 --> 54:07.180\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n54:07.180 --> 54:10.620\n But anyway, so the inflow on the top of the pants\n\n54:10.620 --> 54:14.620\n equals to the outflow on the bottom of the pants.\n\n54:14.620 --> 54:16.900\n Exactly, so this idea that,\n\n54:18.020 --> 54:21.340\n I mean, I think, you know, Poincare really had this idea,\n\n54:21.340 --> 54:22.820\n this sort of modern idea.\n\n54:22.820 --> 54:25.020\n I mean, building on stuff other people did,\n\n54:25.020 --> 54:26.700\n Betty is an important one,\n\n54:26.700 --> 54:29.900\n of this kind of modern notion of relations between holes.\n\n54:29.900 --> 54:32.540\n But the idea that holes really had an arithmetic,\n\n54:32.540 --> 54:35.540\n the really modern view was really Emmy Noether's idea.\n\n54:35.540 --> 54:39.380\n So she kind of comes in and sort of truly puts the subject\n\n54:40.820 --> 54:43.300\n on its modern footing that we have now.\n\n54:43.300 --> 54:45.380\n So, you know, it's always a challenge, you know,\n\n54:45.380 --> 54:48.620\n in the book, I'm not gonna say I give like a course\n\n54:48.620 --> 54:50.300\n so that you read this chapter and then you're like,\n\n54:50.300 --> 54:51.940\n oh, it's just like I took like a semester\n\n54:51.940 --> 54:53.100\n of algebraic anthropology.\n\n54:53.100 --> 54:55.500\n It's not like this and it's always a challenge\n\n54:55.500 --> 54:59.060\n writing about math because there are some things\n\n55:00.260 --> 55:03.300\n that you can really do on the page and the math is there.\n\n55:03.300 --> 55:05.860\n And there's other things which it's too much\n\n55:05.860 --> 55:07.380\n in a book like this to like do them all the page.\n\n55:07.380 --> 55:11.100\n You can only say something about them, if that makes sense.\n\n55:12.620 --> 55:14.780\n So, you know, in the book, I try to do some of both.\n\n55:14.780 --> 55:18.740\n I try to do, I try to, topics that are,\n\n55:18.740 --> 55:22.100\n you can't really compress and really truly say\n\n55:22.100 --> 55:25.420\n exactly what they are in this amount of space.\n\n55:27.420 --> 55:28.980\n I try to say something interesting about them,\n\n55:28.980 --> 55:30.180\n something meaningful about them\n\n55:30.180 --> 55:31.740\n so that readers can get the flavor.\n\n55:31.740 --> 55:33.420\n And then in other places,\n\n55:34.380 --> 55:36.620\n I really try to get up close and personal\n\n55:36.620 --> 55:40.740\n and really do the math and have it take place on the page.\n\n55:40.740 --> 55:44.100\n To some degree be able to give inklings\n\n55:44.100 --> 55:45.820\n of the beauty of the subject.\n\n55:45.820 --> 55:48.260\n Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of books that are like,\n\n55:48.260 --> 55:49.740\n I don't quite know how to express this well.\n\n55:49.740 --> 55:51.020\n I'm still laboring to do it,\n\n55:51.020 --> 55:56.020\n but there's a lot of books that are about stuff,\n\n55:57.380 --> 56:01.020\n but I want my books to not only be about stuff,\n\n56:01.020 --> 56:03.620\n but to actually have some stuff there on the page\n\n56:03.620 --> 56:05.620\n in the book for people to interact with directly\n\n56:05.620 --> 56:07.060\n and not just sort of hear me talk about\n\n56:07.060 --> 56:10.500\n distant features of it.\n\n56:10.500 --> 56:13.700\n Right, so not be talking just about ideas,\n\n56:13.700 --> 56:16.860\n but the actually be expressing the idea.\n\n56:16.860 --> 56:18.700\n Is there, you know, somebody in the,\n\n56:18.700 --> 56:21.420\n maybe you can comment, there's a guy,\n\n56:21.420 --> 56:25.460\n his YouTube channel is 3Blue1Brown, Grant Sanderson.\n\n56:25.460 --> 56:27.860\n He does that masterfully well.\n\n56:27.860 --> 56:28.700\n Absolutely.\n\n56:28.700 --> 56:31.620\n Of visualizing, of expressing a particular idea\n\n56:31.620 --> 56:34.540\n and then talking about it as well back and forth.\n\n56:34.540 --> 56:37.020\n What do you think about Grant?\n\n56:37.020 --> 56:37.980\n It's fantastic.\n\n56:37.980 --> 56:40.180\n I mean, the flowering of math YouTube\n\n56:40.180 --> 56:41.460\n is like such a wonderful thing\n\n56:41.460 --> 56:46.460\n because math teaching, there's so many different venues\n\n56:47.020 --> 56:48.860\n through which we can teach people math.\n\n56:48.860 --> 56:51.500\n There's the traditional one, right?\n\n56:51.500 --> 56:55.300\n Where I'm in a classroom with, depending on the class,\n\n56:55.300 --> 56:57.700\n it could be 30 people, it could be a hundred people,\n\n56:57.700 --> 56:59.460\n it could, God help me, be a 500 people\n\n56:59.460 --> 57:01.860\n if it's like the big calculus lecture or whatever it may be.\n\n57:01.860 --> 57:02.700\n And there's sort of some,\n\n57:02.700 --> 57:05.060\n but there's some set of people of that order of magnitude\n\n57:05.060 --> 57:06.460\n and I'm with them, we have a long time.\n\n57:06.460 --> 57:08.340\n I'm with them for a whole semester\n\n57:08.340 --> 57:10.300\n and I can ask them to do homework and we talk together.\n\n57:10.300 --> 57:12.140\n We have office hours, if they have one on one questions,\n\n57:12.140 --> 57:14.500\n a lot of, it's like a very high level of engagement,\n\n57:14.500 --> 57:17.180\n but how many people am I actually hitting at a time?\n\n57:17.180 --> 57:19.300\n Like not that many, right?\n\n57:20.460 --> 57:22.940\n And you can, and there's kind of an inverse relationship\n\n57:22.940 --> 57:27.740\n where the more, the fewer people you're talking to,\n\n57:27.740 --> 57:29.300\n the more engagement you can ask for.\n\n57:29.300 --> 57:32.020\n The ultimate of course is like the mentorship relation\n\n57:32.020 --> 57:35.020\n of like a PhD advisor and a graduate student\n\n57:35.020 --> 57:38.020\n where you spend a lot of one on one time together\n\n57:38.020 --> 57:40.380\n for like three to five years.\n\n57:41.260 --> 57:44.820\n And the ultimate high level of engagement to one person.\n\n57:46.380 --> 57:50.420\n Books, this can get to a lot more people\n\n57:50.420 --> 57:52.700\n that are ever gonna sit in my classroom\n\n57:52.700 --> 57:57.060\n and you spend like however many hours it takes\n\n57:57.060 --> 57:58.700\n to read a book.\n\n57:58.700 --> 58:01.140\n Somebody like Three Blue One Brown or Numberphile\n\n58:01.140 --> 58:03.140\n or people like Vi Hart.\n\n58:03.140 --> 58:07.900\n I mean, YouTube, let's face it, has bigger reach than a book.\n\n58:07.900 --> 58:09.660\n Like there's YouTube videos that have many, many,\n\n58:09.660 --> 58:13.300\n many more views than like any hardback book\n\n58:13.300 --> 58:15.820\n like not written by a Kardashian or an Obama\n\n58:15.820 --> 58:16.660\n is gonna sell, right?\n\n58:16.660 --> 58:17.580\n So that's, I mean,\n\n58:20.100 --> 58:24.860\n and then those are, some of them are like longer,\n\n58:24.860 --> 58:26.580\n 20 minutes long, some of them are five minutes long,\n\n58:26.580 --> 58:27.820\n but they're shorter.\n\n58:27.820 --> 58:29.740\n And then even some of you look like Eugenia Chang\n\n58:29.740 --> 58:31.540\n who's a wonderful category theorist in Chicago.\n\n58:31.540 --> 58:33.620\n I mean, she was on, I think the Daily Show or is it,\n\n58:33.620 --> 58:35.820\n I mean, she was on, she has 30 seconds,\n\n58:35.820 --> 58:37.060\n but then there's like 30 seconds\n\n58:37.060 --> 58:38.740\n to sort of say something about mathematics\n\n58:38.740 --> 58:41.100\n to like untold millions of people.\n\n58:41.100 --> 58:43.980\n So everywhere along this curve is important.\n\n58:43.980 --> 58:46.580\n And one thing I feel like is great right now\n\n58:46.580 --> 58:49.220\n is that people are just broadcasting on all the channels\n\n58:49.220 --> 58:51.900\n because we each have our skills, right?\n\n58:51.900 --> 58:53.820\n Somehow along the way, like I learned how to write books.\n\n58:53.820 --> 58:55.700\n I had this kind of weird life as a writer\n\n58:55.700 --> 58:57.100\n where I sort of spent a lot of time\n\n58:57.100 --> 58:59.620\n like thinking about how to put English words together\n\n58:59.620 --> 59:01.880\n into sentences and sentences together into paragraphs,\n\n59:01.880 --> 59:03.300\n like at length,\n\n59:03.300 --> 59:06.940\n which is this kind of like weird specialized skill.\n\n59:06.940 --> 59:09.140\n And that's one thing, but like sort of being able to make\n\n59:09.140 --> 59:13.000\n like winning, good looking, eye catching videos\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.060\n is like a totally different skill.\n\n59:15.060 --> 59:16.740\n And probably somewhere out there,\n\n59:16.740 --> 59:19.540\n there's probably sort of some like heavy metal band\n\n59:19.540 --> 59:21.820\n that's like teaching math through heavy metal\n\n59:21.820 --> 59:23.340\n and like using their skills to do that.\n\n59:23.340 --> 59:25.060\n I hope there is at any rate.\n\n59:25.060 --> 59:26.580\n Their music and so on, yeah.\n\n59:26.580 --> 59:28.820\n But there is something to the process.\n\n59:28.820 --> 59:31.740\n I mean, Grant does this especially well,\n\n59:31.740 --> 59:36.420\n which is in order to be able to visualize something,\n\n59:36.420 --> 59:39.560\n now he writes programs, so it's programmatic visualization.\n\n59:39.560 --> 59:42.900\n So like the things he is basically mostly\n\n59:42.900 --> 59:46.220\n through his Manum library and Python,\n\n59:46.220 --> 59:48.280\n everything is drawn through Python.\n\n59:49.340 --> 59:54.340\n You have to truly understand the topic\n\n59:54.600 --> 59:58.140\n to be able to visualize it in that way\n\n59:58.140 --> 59:59.700\n and not just understand it,\n\n59:59.700 --> 1:00:04.380\n but really kind of think in a very novel way.\n\n1:00:04.380 --> 1:00:07.540\n It's funny because I've spoken with him a couple of times,\n\n1:00:07.540 --> 1:00:09.860\n spoken to him a lot offline as well.\n\n1:00:09.860 --> 1:00:14.100\n He really doesn't think he's doing anything new,\n\n1:00:14.100 --> 1:00:17.380\n meaning like he sees himself as very different\n\n1:00:17.380 --> 1:00:19.240\n from maybe like a researcher,\n\n1:00:20.460 --> 1:00:25.460\n but it feels to me like he's creating something totally new.\n\n1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:29.340\n Like that act of understanding and visualizing\n\n1:00:29.340 --> 1:00:33.380\n is as powerful or has the same kind of inkling of power\n\n1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:35.920\n as does the process of proving something.\n\n1:00:36.980 --> 1:00:39.940\n It doesn't have that clear destination,\n\n1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:42.180\n but it's pulling out an insight\n\n1:00:42.180 --> 1:00:44.900\n and creating multiple sets of perspective\n\n1:00:44.900 --> 1:00:46.980\n that arrive at that insight.\n\n1:00:46.980 --> 1:00:49.220\n And to be honest, it's something that I think\n\n1:00:49.220 --> 1:00:53.340\n we haven't quite figured out how to value\n\n1:00:53.340 --> 1:00:55.380\n inside academic mathematics in the same way,\n\n1:00:55.380 --> 1:00:56.220\n and this is a bit older,\n\n1:00:56.220 --> 1:00:57.780\n that I think we haven't quite figured out\n\n1:00:57.780 --> 1:00:59.460\n how to value the development\n\n1:00:59.460 --> 1:01:01.020\n of computational infrastructure.\n\n1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:02.900\n We all have computers as our partners now\n\n1:01:02.900 --> 1:01:07.860\n and people build computers that sort of assist\n\n1:01:07.860 --> 1:01:09.300\n and participate in our mathematics.\n\n1:01:09.300 --> 1:01:10.480\n They build those systems\n\n1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:12.600\n and that's a kind of mathematics too,\n\n1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:14.020\n but not in the traditional form\n\n1:01:14.020 --> 1:01:16.420\n of proving theorems and writing papers.\n\n1:01:16.420 --> 1:01:17.260\n But I think it's coming.\n\n1:01:17.260 --> 1:01:20.380\n Look, I mean, I think, for example,\n\n1:01:20.380 --> 1:01:23.520\n the Institute for Computational Experimental Mathematics\n\n1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:27.820\n at Brown, which is like, it's a NSF funded math institute,\n\n1:01:27.820 --> 1:01:29.860\n very much part of sort of traditional math academia.\n\n1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:31.720\n They did an entire theme semester\n\n1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:33.180\n about visualizing mathematics,\n\n1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:34.620\n looking at the same kind of thing that they would do\n\n1:01:34.620 --> 1:01:37.780\n for like an up and coming research topic.\n\n1:01:37.780 --> 1:01:38.620\n Like that's pretty cool.\n\n1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:40.260\n So I think there really is buy in\n\n1:01:40.260 --> 1:01:43.380\n from the mathematics community\n\n1:01:43.380 --> 1:01:45.420\n to recognize that this kind of stuff is important\n\n1:01:45.420 --> 1:01:47.540\n and counts as part of mathematics,\n\n1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:50.560\n like part of what we're actually here to do.\n\n1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.020\n Yeah, I'm hoping to see more and more of that\n\n1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:54.420\n from like MIT faculty, from faculty,\n\n1:01:54.420 --> 1:01:57.540\n from all the top universities in the world.\n\n1:01:57.540 --> 1:02:00.020\n Let me ask you this weird question about the Fields Medal,\n\n1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:02.960\n which is the Nobel Prize in Mathematics.\n\n1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:05.540\n Do you think, since we're talking about computers,\n\n1:02:05.540 --> 1:02:10.540\n there will one day come a time when a computer,\n\n1:02:11.860 --> 1:02:14.100\n an AI system will win a Fields Medal?\n\n1:02:16.060 --> 1:02:16.900\n No.\n\n1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:19.740\n Of course, that's what a human would say.\n\n1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:20.580\n Why not?\n\n1:02:20.580 --> 1:02:23.380\n Is that like, that's like my captcha?\n\n1:02:23.380 --> 1:02:24.500\n That's like the proof that I'm a human?\n\n1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:25.340\n Is that like the lie that I know?\n\n1:02:25.340 --> 1:02:26.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:26.820 --> 1:02:28.940\n What is, how does he want me to answer?\n\n1:02:28.940 --> 1:02:31.980\n Is there something interesting to be said about that?\n\n1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:34.620\n Yeah, I mean, I am tremendously interested\n\n1:02:34.620 --> 1:02:37.820\n in what AI can do in pure mathematics.\n\n1:02:37.820 --> 1:02:40.500\n I mean, it's, of course, it's a parochial interest, right?\n\n1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:41.700\n You're like, why am I interested in like,\n\n1:02:41.700 --> 1:02:43.140\n how it can like help feed the world\n\n1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:44.700\n or help solve like real social problems?\n\n1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:46.140\n I'm like, can it do more math?\n\n1:02:46.140 --> 1:02:47.540\n Like, what can I do?\n\n1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:49.580\n We all have our interests, right?\n\n1:02:49.580 --> 1:02:53.700\n But I think it is a really interesting conceptual question.\n\n1:02:53.700 --> 1:02:58.700\n And here too, I think it's important to be kind of historical\n\n1:02:59.820 --> 1:03:02.260\n because it's certainly true that there's lots of things\n\n1:03:02.260 --> 1:03:04.940\n that we used to call research in mathematics\n\n1:03:04.940 --> 1:03:07.380\n that we would now call computation.\n\n1:03:07.380 --> 1:03:09.620\n Tasks that we've now offloaded to machines.\n\n1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:12.580\n Like, you know, in 1890, somebody could be like,\n\n1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:13.780\n here's my PhD thesis.\n\n1:03:13.780 --> 1:03:18.180\n I computed all the invariants of this polynomial ring\n\n1:03:18.180 --> 1:03:19.900\n under the action of some finite group.\n\n1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:21.380\n Doesn't matter what those words mean,\n\n1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:24.020\n just it's like some thing that in 1890\n\n1:03:24.020 --> 1:03:26.060\n would take a person a year to do\n\n1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:28.060\n and would be a valuable thing that you might wanna know.\n\n1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:29.940\n And it's still a valuable thing that you might wanna know,\n\n1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:32.780\n but now you type a few lines of code\n\n1:03:32.780 --> 1:03:37.740\n in Macaulay or Sage or Magma and you just have it.\n\n1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:40.260\n So we don't think of that as math anymore,\n\n1:03:40.260 --> 1:03:41.700\n even though it's the same thing.\n\n1:03:41.700 --> 1:03:43.420\n What's Macaulay, Sage and Magma?\n\n1:03:43.420 --> 1:03:45.060\n Oh, those are computer algebra programs.\n\n1:03:45.060 --> 1:03:46.900\n So those are like sort of bespoke systems\n\n1:03:46.900 --> 1:03:48.140\n that lots of mathematicians use.\n\n1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.620\n That's similar to Maple and...\n\n1:03:49.620 --> 1:03:51.580\n Yeah, oh yeah, so it's similar to Maple and Mathematica,\n\n1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:54.700\n yeah, but a little more specialized, but yeah.\n\n1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:56.620\n It's programs that work with symbols\n\n1:03:56.620 --> 1:03:58.180\n and allow you to do, can you do proofs?\n\n1:03:58.180 --> 1:04:01.060\n Can you do kind of little leaps and proofs?\n\n1:04:01.060 --> 1:04:02.420\n They're not really built for that.\n\n1:04:02.420 --> 1:04:04.780\n And that's a whole other story.\n\n1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:07.300\n But these tools are part of the process of mathematics now.\n\n1:04:07.300 --> 1:04:09.940\n Right, they are now for most mathematicians, I would say,\n\n1:04:09.940 --> 1:04:11.620\n part of the process of mathematics.\n\n1:04:11.620 --> 1:04:14.740\n And so, you know, there's a story I tell in the book,\n\n1:04:14.740 --> 1:04:17.740\n which I'm fascinated by, which is, you know,\n\n1:04:17.740 --> 1:04:22.540\n so far, attempts to get AIs\n\n1:04:22.540 --> 1:04:27.300\n to prove interesting theorems have not done so well.\n\n1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:28.140\n It doesn't mean they can.\n\n1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:29.740\n There's actually a paper I just saw,\n\n1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:32.460\n which has a very nice use of a neural net\n\n1:04:32.460 --> 1:04:34.620\n to find counter examples to conjecture.\n\n1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:37.220\n Somebody said like, well, maybe this is always that.\n\n1:04:37.220 --> 1:04:39.300\n And you can be like, well, let me sort of train an AI\n\n1:04:39.300 --> 1:04:43.180\n to sort of try to find things where that's not true.\n\n1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:44.020\n And it actually succeeded.\n\n1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:48.180\n Now, in this case, if you look at the things that it found,\n\n1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:53.180\n you say like, okay, I mean, these are not famous conjectures.\n\n1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:58.180\n Okay, so like somebody wrote this down, maybe this is so.\n\n1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:00.900\n Looking at what the AI came up with, you're like,\n\n1:05:00.900 --> 1:05:03.700\n you know, I bet if like five grad students\n\n1:05:03.700 --> 1:05:04.660\n had thought about that problem,\n\n1:05:04.660 --> 1:05:05.500\n they wouldn't have come up with that.\n\n1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:06.820\n I mean, when you see it, you're like,\n\n1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:08.380\n okay, that is one of the things you might try\n\n1:05:08.380 --> 1:05:10.500\n if you sort of like put some work into it.\n\n1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:12.620\n Still, it's pretty awesome.\n\n1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:15.740\n But the story I tell in the book, which I'm fascinated by\n\n1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:20.740\n is there is, okay, we're gonna go back to knots.\n\n1:05:21.940 --> 1:05:23.940\n There's a knot called the Conway knot.\n\n1:05:23.940 --> 1:05:25.380\n After John Conway, maybe we'll talk about\n\n1:05:25.380 --> 1:05:26.420\n a very interesting character also.\n\n1:05:26.420 --> 1:05:28.140\n Yeah, it's a small tangent.\n\n1:05:28.140 --> 1:05:29.420\n Somebody I was supposed to talk to\n\n1:05:29.420 --> 1:05:30.780\n and unfortunately he passed away\n\n1:05:30.780 --> 1:05:35.220\n and he's somebody I find as an incredible mathematician,\n\n1:05:35.220 --> 1:05:36.220\n incredible human being.\n\n1:05:36.220 --> 1:05:38.300\n Oh, and I am sorry that you didn't get a chance\n\n1:05:38.300 --> 1:05:40.300\n because having had the chance to talk to him a lot\n\n1:05:40.300 --> 1:05:44.140\n when I was a postdoc, yeah, you missed out.\n\n1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:45.140\n There's no way to sugarcoat it.\n\n1:05:45.140 --> 1:05:46.620\n I'm sorry that you didn't get that chance.\n\n1:05:46.620 --> 1:05:47.900\n Yeah, it is what it is.\n\n1:05:47.900 --> 1:05:50.100\n So knots.\n\n1:05:50.100 --> 1:05:52.580\n Yeah, so there was a question and again,\n\n1:05:52.580 --> 1:05:54.380\n it doesn't matter the technicalities of the question,\n\n1:05:54.380 --> 1:05:56.300\n but it's a question of whether the knot is slice.\n\n1:05:56.300 --> 1:05:59.980\n It has to do with something about what kinds\n\n1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:02.340\n of three dimensional surfaces and four dimensions\n\n1:06:02.340 --> 1:06:03.460\n can be bounded by this knot.\n\n1:06:03.460 --> 1:06:06.180\n But nevermind what it means, it's some question.\n\n1:06:06.180 --> 1:06:08.300\n And it's actually very hard to compute\n\n1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:10.540\n whether a knot is slice or not.\n\n1:06:12.860 --> 1:06:16.940\n And in particular, the question of the Conway knot,\n\n1:06:16.940 --> 1:06:21.260\n whether it was slice or not, was particularly vexed\n\n1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:24.620\n until it was solved just a few years ago\n\n1:06:24.620 --> 1:06:26.260\n by Lisa Piccarillo, who actually,\n\n1:06:26.260 --> 1:06:27.700\n now that I think of it, was here in Austin.\n\n1:06:27.700 --> 1:06:29.980\n I believe she was a grad student at UT Austin at the time.\n\n1:06:29.980 --> 1:06:31.540\n I didn't even realize there was an Austin connection\n\n1:06:31.540 --> 1:06:34.100\n to this story until I started telling it.\n\n1:06:34.100 --> 1:06:35.780\n In fact, I think she's now at MIT,\n\n1:06:35.780 --> 1:06:38.140\n so she's basically following you around.\n\n1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:38.980\n If I remember correctly.\n\n1:06:38.980 --> 1:06:39.820\n The reverse.\n\n1:06:39.820 --> 1:06:42.700\n There's a lot of really interesting richness to this story.\n\n1:06:42.700 --> 1:06:45.620\n One thing about it is her paper was rather,\n\n1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:48.140\n was very short, it was very short and simple.\n\n1:06:48.140 --> 1:06:49.980\n Nine pages of which two were pictures.\n\n1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:54.620\n Very short for like a paper solving a major conjecture.\n\n1:06:54.620 --> 1:06:55.900\n And it really makes you think about what we mean\n\n1:06:55.900 --> 1:06:57.300\n by difficulty in mathematics.\n\n1:06:57.300 --> 1:06:59.460\n Like, do you say, oh, actually the problem wasn't difficult\n\n1:06:59.460 --> 1:07:00.860\n because you could solve it so simply?\n\n1:07:00.860 --> 1:07:03.300\n Or do you say like, well, no, evidently it was difficult\n\n1:07:03.300 --> 1:07:05.180\n because like the world's top topologists,\n\n1:07:05.180 --> 1:07:06.580\n many, you know, worked on it for 20 years\n\n1:07:06.580 --> 1:07:08.540\n and nobody could solve it, so therefore it is difficult.\n\n1:07:08.540 --> 1:07:10.460\n Or is it that we need sort of some new category\n\n1:07:10.460 --> 1:07:12.820\n of things that about which it's difficult\n\n1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:14.820\n to figure out that they're not difficult?\n\n1:07:15.700 --> 1:07:18.660\n I mean, this is the computer science formulation,\n\n1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:22.740\n but the sort of the journey to arrive\n\n1:07:22.740 --> 1:07:24.700\n at the simple answer may be difficult,\n\n1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:28.700\n but once you have the answer, it will then appear simple.\n\n1:07:28.700 --> 1:07:30.620\n And I mean, there might be a large category.\n\n1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:37.380\n I hope there's a large set of such solutions,\n\n1:07:37.380 --> 1:07:41.460\n because, you know, once we stand\n\n1:07:41.460 --> 1:07:43.380\n at the end of the scientific process\n\n1:07:43.380 --> 1:07:46.100\n that we're at the very beginning of,\n\n1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:47.540\n or at least it feels like,\n\n1:07:47.540 --> 1:07:50.140\n I hope there's just simple answers to everything\n\n1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:53.580\n that we'll look and it'll be simple laws\n\n1:07:53.580 --> 1:07:55.100\n that govern the universe,\n\n1:07:55.100 --> 1:07:58.020\n simple explanation of what is consciousness,\n\n1:07:58.020 --> 1:08:02.340\n what is love, is mortality fundamental to life,\n\n1:08:02.340 --> 1:08:07.100\n what's the meaning of life, are humans special\n\n1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:09.100\n or we're just another sort of reflection\n\n1:08:09.100 --> 1:08:13.740\n of all that is beautiful in the universe\n\n1:08:13.740 --> 1:08:16.180\n in terms of like life forms, all of it is life\n\n1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:18.380\n and just has different,\n\n1:08:18.380 --> 1:08:19.900\n when taken from a different perspective\n\n1:08:19.900 --> 1:08:22.460\n is all life can seem more valuable or not,\n\n1:08:22.460 --> 1:08:24.180\n but really it's all part of the same thing.\n\n1:08:24.180 --> 1:08:26.500\n All those will have a nice, like two equations,\n\n1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:28.100\n maybe one equation, but.\n\n1:08:28.100 --> 1:08:30.820\n Why do you think you want those questions\n\n1:08:30.820 --> 1:08:32.740\n to have simple answers?\n\n1:08:32.740 --> 1:08:35.700\n I think just like symmetry\n\n1:08:35.700 --> 1:08:39.020\n and the breaking of symmetry is beautiful somehow.\n\n1:08:39.020 --> 1:08:41.420\n There's something beautiful about simplicity.\n\n1:08:41.420 --> 1:08:42.260\n I think it, what is that?\n\n1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:43.420\n So it's aesthetic.\n\n1:08:43.420 --> 1:08:45.140\n It's aesthetic, yeah.\n\n1:08:45.140 --> 1:08:47.100\n Or, but it's aesthetic in the way\n\n1:08:47.100 --> 1:08:49.660\n that happiness is an aesthetic.\n\n1:08:49.660 --> 1:08:53.660\n Like, why is that so joyful\n\n1:08:53.660 --> 1:08:57.700\n that a simple explanation that governs\n\n1:08:57.700 --> 1:09:00.740\n a large number of cases is really appealing?\n\n1:09:01.940 --> 1:09:05.820\n Even when it's not, like obviously we get\n\n1:09:05.820 --> 1:09:07.340\n a huge amount of trouble with that\n\n1:09:07.340 --> 1:09:11.460\n because oftentimes it doesn't have to be connected\n\n1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:13.500\n with reality or even that explanation\n\n1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:15.580\n could be exceptionally harmful.\n\n1:09:15.580 --> 1:09:18.860\n Most of like the world's history that has,\n\n1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:21.020\n that was governed by hate and violence\n\n1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:23.980\n had a very simple explanation at the core\n\n1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:26.980\n that was used to cause the violence and the hatred.\n\n1:09:26.980 --> 1:09:28.780\n So like we get into trouble with that,\n\n1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:30.420\n but why is that so appealing?\n\n1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:33.820\n And in this nice forms in mathematics,\n\n1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:36.580\n like you look at the Einstein papers,\n\n1:09:36.580 --> 1:09:38.020\n why are those so beautiful?\n\n1:09:38.020 --> 1:09:40.180\n And why is the Andrew Wiles proof\n\n1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:43.220\n of the Fermat's last theorem not quite so beautiful?\n\n1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:45.620\n Like what's beautiful about that story\n\n1:09:45.620 --> 1:09:48.900\n is the human struggle of like the human story\n\n1:09:48.900 --> 1:09:51.700\n of perseverance, of the drama,\n\n1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:53.900\n of not knowing if the proof is correct\n\n1:09:53.900 --> 1:09:56.060\n and ups and downs and all of those kinds of things.\n\n1:09:56.060 --> 1:09:57.220\n That's the interesting part.\n\n1:09:57.220 --> 1:09:58.660\n But the fact that the proof is huge\n\n1:09:58.660 --> 1:10:00.020\n and nobody understands, well,\n\n1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:01.220\n from my outsider's perspective,\n\n1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:03.220\n nobody understands what the heck it is,\n\n1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:06.700\n is not as beautiful as it could have been.\n\n1:10:06.700 --> 1:10:09.220\n I wish it was what Fermat originally said,\n\n1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:13.740\n which is, you know, it's not,\n\n1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:17.220\n it's not small enough to fit in the margins of this page,\n\n1:10:17.220 --> 1:10:19.300\n but maybe if he had like a full page\n\n1:10:19.300 --> 1:10:20.820\n or maybe a couple of post it notes,\n\n1:10:20.820 --> 1:10:22.940\n he would have enough to do the proof.\n\n1:10:22.940 --> 1:10:23.860\n What do you make of,\n\n1:10:23.860 --> 1:10:27.740\n if we could take another of a multitude of tangents,\n\n1:10:27.740 --> 1:10:29.260\n what do you make of Fermat's last theorem?\n\n1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:31.660\n Because the statement, there's a few theorems,\n\n1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:35.540\n there's a few problems that are deemed by the world\n\n1:10:35.540 --> 1:10:37.780\n throughout its history to be exceptionally difficult.\n\n1:10:37.780 --> 1:10:42.380\n And that one in particular is really simple to formulate\n\n1:10:42.380 --> 1:10:46.260\n and really hard to come up with a proof for.\n\n1:10:46.260 --> 1:10:51.260\n And it was like taunted as simple by Fermat himself.\n\n1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:53.900\n Is there something interesting to be said about\n\n1:10:53.900 --> 1:10:57.700\n that X to the N plus Y to the N equals Z to the N\n\n1:10:57.700 --> 1:11:02.540\n for N of three or greater, is there a solution to this?\n\n1:11:02.540 --> 1:11:04.300\n And then how do you go about proving that?\n\n1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:08.180\n Like, how would you try to prove that?\n\n1:11:08.180 --> 1:11:09.980\n And what do you learn from the proof\n\n1:11:09.980 --> 1:11:12.100\n that eventually emerged by Andrew Wiles?\n\n1:11:12.100 --> 1:11:13.460\n Yeah, so right, so to give,\n\n1:11:13.460 --> 1:11:14.380\n let me just say the background,\n\n1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:17.020\n because I don't know if everybody listening knows the story.\n\n1:11:17.020 --> 1:11:21.940\n So, you know, Fermat was an early number theorist,\n\n1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:23.100\n at least sort of an early mathematician,\n\n1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:26.060\n those special adjacent didn't really exist back then.\n\n1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:28.660\n He comes up in the book actually,\n\n1:11:28.660 --> 1:11:31.460\n in the context of a different theorem of his\n\n1:11:31.460 --> 1:11:32.620\n that has to do with testing,\n\n1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:34.620\n whether a number is prime or not.\n\n1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:37.380\n So I write about, he was one of the ones who was salty\n\n1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:39.460\n and like, he would exchange these letters\n\n1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:41.100\n where he and his correspondents would like\n\n1:11:41.100 --> 1:11:44.060\n try to top each other and vex each other with questions\n\n1:11:44.060 --> 1:11:44.900\n and stuff like this.\n\n1:11:44.900 --> 1:11:45.980\n But this particular thing,\n\n1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:50.780\n it's called Fermat's Last Theorem because it's a note\n\n1:11:50.780 --> 1:11:55.780\n he wrote in his copy of the Disquisitiones Arithmetic I.\n\n1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:00.820\n Like he wrote, here's an equation, it has no solutions.\n\n1:12:00.820 --> 1:12:03.300\n I can prove it, but the proof's like a little too long\n\n1:12:03.300 --> 1:12:05.500\n to fit in the margin of this book.\n\n1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:07.060\n He was just like writing a note to himself.\n\n1:12:07.060 --> 1:12:08.540\n Now, let me just say historically,\n\n1:12:08.540 --> 1:12:11.540\n we know that Fermat did not have a proof of this theorem.\n\n1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:15.420\n For a long time, people were like this mysterious proof\n\n1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:17.220\n that was lost, a very romantic story, right?\n\n1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:21.300\n But a fair amount later,\n\n1:12:21.300 --> 1:12:24.260\n he did prove special cases of this theorem\n\n1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:27.300\n and wrote about it, talked to people about the problem.\n\n1:12:27.300 --> 1:12:29.060\n It's very clear from the way that he wrote\n\n1:12:29.060 --> 1:12:30.700\n where he can solve certain examples\n\n1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:32.100\n of this type of equation\n\n1:12:32.100 --> 1:12:35.700\n that he did not know how to do the whole thing.\n\n1:12:35.700 --> 1:12:39.860\n He may have had a deep, simple intuition\n\n1:12:39.860 --> 1:12:41.740\n about how to solve the whole thing\n\n1:12:41.740 --> 1:12:43.780\n that he had at that moment\n\n1:12:43.780 --> 1:12:47.020\n without ever being able to come up with a complete proof.\n\n1:12:47.020 --> 1:12:49.060\n And that intuition maybe lost the time.\n\n1:12:50.420 --> 1:12:54.500\n Maybe, but you're right, that is unknowable.\n\n1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:56.940\n But I think what we can know is that later,\n\n1:12:56.940 --> 1:12:59.100\n he certainly did not think that he had a proof\n\n1:12:59.100 --> 1:13:00.620\n that he was concealing from people.\n\n1:13:00.620 --> 1:13:04.340\n He thought he didn't know how to prove it,\n\n1:13:04.340 --> 1:13:06.380\n and I also think he didn't know how to prove it.\n\n1:13:06.380 --> 1:13:10.180\n Now, I understand the appeal of saying like,\n\n1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:12.500\n wouldn't it be cool if this very simple equation\n\n1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:16.020\n there was like a very simple, clever, wonderful proof\n\n1:13:16.020 --> 1:13:17.340\n that you could do in a page or two.\n\n1:13:17.340 --> 1:13:18.980\n And that would be great, but you know what?\n\n1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:20.340\n There's lots of equations like that\n\n1:13:20.340 --> 1:13:22.180\n that are solved by very clever methods like that,\n\n1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:24.340\n including the special cases that Fermat wrote about,\n\n1:13:24.340 --> 1:13:25.180\n the method of descent,\n\n1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:26.860\n which is like very wonderful and important.\n\n1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:31.700\n But in the end, those are nice things\n\n1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:34.780\n that like you teach in an undergraduate class,\n\n1:13:34.780 --> 1:13:35.860\n and it is what it is,\n\n1:13:35.860 --> 1:13:37.020\n but they're not big.\n\n1:13:38.660 --> 1:13:41.580\n On the other hand, work on the Fermat problem,\n\n1:13:41.580 --> 1:13:42.420\n that's what we like to call it\n\n1:13:42.420 --> 1:13:44.100\n because it's not really his theorem\n\n1:13:44.100 --> 1:13:45.220\n because we don't think he proved it.\n\n1:13:45.220 --> 1:13:49.180\n So, I mean, work on the Fermat problem\n\n1:13:49.180 --> 1:13:52.340\n developed this like incredible richness of number theory\n\n1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:54.780\n that we now live in today.\n\n1:13:54.780 --> 1:13:56.060\n Like, and not, by the way,\n\n1:13:56.060 --> 1:13:58.660\n just Wiles, Andrew Wiles being the person\n\n1:13:58.660 --> 1:13:59.660\n who, together with Richard Taylor,\n\n1:13:59.660 --> 1:14:01.700\n finally proved this theorem.\n\n1:14:01.700 --> 1:14:03.220\n But you know how you have this whole moment\n\n1:14:03.220 --> 1:14:05.380\n that people try to prove this theorem\n\n1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:06.540\n and they fail,\n\n1:14:06.540 --> 1:14:08.780\n and there's a famous false proof by LeMay\n\n1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:10.420\n from the 19th century,\n\n1:14:10.420 --> 1:14:14.460\n where Kummer, in understanding what mistake LeMay had made\n\n1:14:14.460 --> 1:14:16.300\n in this incorrect proof,\n\n1:14:16.300 --> 1:14:18.340\n basically understands something incredible,\n\n1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:20.940\n which is that a thing we know about numbers\n\n1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:24.500\n is that you can factor them\n\n1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:26.940\n and you can factor them uniquely.\n\n1:14:26.940 --> 1:14:30.300\n There's only one way to break a number up into primes.\n\n1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:32.260\n Like if we think of a number like 12,\n\n1:14:32.260 --> 1:14:35.500\n 12 is two times three times two.\n\n1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:36.700\n I had to think about it.\n\n1:14:38.420 --> 1:14:39.700\n Or it's two times two times three,\n\n1:14:39.700 --> 1:14:41.580\n of course you can reorder them.\n\n1:14:41.580 --> 1:14:43.220\n But there's no other way to do it.\n\n1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:46.140\n There's no universe in which 12 is something times five,\n\n1:14:46.140 --> 1:14:47.500\n or in which there's like four threes in it.\n\n1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:49.140\n Nope, 12 is like two twos and a three.\n\n1:14:49.140 --> 1:14:50.700\n Like that is what it is.\n\n1:14:50.700 --> 1:14:54.820\n And that's such a fundamental feature of arithmetic\n\n1:14:54.820 --> 1:14:56.540\n that we almost think of it like God's law.\n\n1:14:56.540 --> 1:14:57.380\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:14:57.380 --> 1:14:58.220\n It has to be that way.\n\n1:14:58.220 --> 1:15:00.020\n That's a really powerful idea.\n\n1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:02.540\n It's so cool that every number\n\n1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:04.740\n is uniquely made up of other numbers.\n\n1:15:05.620 --> 1:15:10.620\n And like made up meaning like there's these like basic atoms\n\n1:15:10.900 --> 1:15:15.380\n that form molecules that get built on top of each other.\n\n1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:16.220\n I love it.\n\n1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:18.060\n I mean, when I teach undergraduate number theory,\n\n1:15:18.060 --> 1:15:22.180\n it's like, it's the first really deep theorem\n\n1:15:22.180 --> 1:15:23.540\n that you prove.\n\n1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:25.300\n What's amazing is the fact\n\n1:15:25.300 --> 1:15:28.980\n that you can factor a number into primes is much easier.\n\n1:15:28.980 --> 1:15:30.340\n Essentially Euclid knew it,\n\n1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:33.700\n although he didn't quite put it in that way.\n\n1:15:33.700 --> 1:15:34.860\n The fact that you can do it at all.\n\n1:15:34.860 --> 1:15:38.820\n What's deep is the fact that there's only one way to do it\n\n1:15:38.820 --> 1:15:40.620\n or however you sort of chop the number up,\n\n1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:43.440\n you end up with the same set of prime factors.\n\n1:15:44.820 --> 1:15:48.260\n And indeed what people finally understood\n\n1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.900\n at the end of the 19th century is that\n\n1:15:51.900 --> 1:15:54.620\n if you work in number systems slightly more general\n\n1:15:54.620 --> 1:15:56.100\n than the ones we're used to,\n\n1:15:56.100 --> 1:16:00.260\n which it turns out are relevant to Fermat,\n\n1:16:01.220 --> 1:16:03.120\n all of a sudden this stops being true.\n\n1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:07.980\n Things get, I mean, things get more complicated\n\n1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:10.060\n and now because you were praising simplicity before\n\n1:16:10.060 --> 1:16:12.700\n you were like, it's so beautiful, unique factorization.\n\n1:16:12.700 --> 1:16:13.740\n It's so great.\n\n1:16:13.740 --> 1:16:14.900\n Like, so when I tell you\n\n1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:16.700\n that in more general number systems,\n\n1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:18.380\n there is no unique factorization.\n\n1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:19.360\n Maybe you're like, that's bad.\n\n1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:20.260\n I'm like, no, that's good\n\n1:16:20.260 --> 1:16:22.580\n because there's like a whole new world of phenomena\n\n1:16:22.580 --> 1:16:24.380\n to study that you just can't see\n\n1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:26.980\n through the lens of the numbers that we're used to.\n\n1:16:26.980 --> 1:16:29.940\n So I'm for complication.\n\n1:16:29.940 --> 1:16:32.380\n I'm highly in favor of complication\n\n1:16:32.380 --> 1:16:34.620\n because every complication is like an opportunity\n\n1:16:34.620 --> 1:16:35.900\n for new things to study.\n\n1:16:35.900 --> 1:16:40.180\n And is that the big kind of one of the big insights\n\n1:16:40.180 --> 1:16:42.900\n for you from Andrew Wiles's proof?\n\n1:16:42.900 --> 1:16:46.300\n Is there interesting insights about the process\n\n1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:49.580\n that you used to prove that sort of resonates\n\n1:16:49.580 --> 1:16:51.380\n with you as a mathematician?\n\n1:16:51.380 --> 1:16:54.420\n Is there an interesting concept that emerged from it?\n\n1:16:54.420 --> 1:16:57.980\n Is there interesting human aspects to the proof?\n\n1:16:57.980 --> 1:16:59.860\n Whether there's interesting human aspects\n\n1:16:59.860 --> 1:17:02.640\n to the proof itself is an interesting question.\n\n1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:05.520\n Certainly it has a huge amount of richness.\n\n1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:07.680\n Sort of at its heart is an argument\n\n1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:10.020\n of what's called deformation theory,\n\n1:17:12.420 --> 1:17:17.420\n which was in part created by my PhD advisor, Barry Mazer.\n\n1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:20.180\n Can you speak to what deformation theory is?\n\n1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:21.940\n I can speak to what it's like.\n\n1:17:21.940 --> 1:17:22.940\n How about that?\n\n1:17:22.940 --> 1:17:24.660\n What does it rhyme with?\n\n1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:27.340\n Right, well, the reason that Barry called it\n\n1:17:27.340 --> 1:17:29.460\n deformation theory, I think he's the one\n\n1:17:29.460 --> 1:17:30.860\n who gave it the name.\n\n1:17:30.860 --> 1:17:32.340\n I hope I'm not wrong in saying it's a name.\n\n1:17:32.340 --> 1:17:35.140\n In your book, you have calling different things\n\n1:17:35.140 --> 1:17:37.860\n by the same name as one of the things\n\n1:17:37.860 --> 1:17:40.380\n in the beautiful map that opens the book.\n\n1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:42.040\n Yes, and this is a perfect example.\n\n1:17:42.040 --> 1:17:44.100\n So this is another phrase of Poincare,\n\n1:17:44.100 --> 1:17:46.780\n this like incredible generator of slogans and aphorisms.\n\n1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:47.900\n He said, mathematics is the art\n\n1:17:47.900 --> 1:17:49.860\n of calling different things by the same name.\n\n1:17:49.860 --> 1:17:52.500\n That very thing we do, right?\n\n1:17:52.500 --> 1:17:53.980\n When we're like this triangle and this triangle,\n\n1:17:53.980 --> 1:17:55.040\n come on, they're the same triangle,\n\n1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:56.500\n they're just in a different place, right?\n\n1:17:56.500 --> 1:18:00.420\n So in the same way, it came to be understood\n\n1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:04.140\n that the kinds of objects that you study\n\n1:18:06.900 --> 1:18:10.180\n when you study Fermat's Last Theorem,\n\n1:18:10.180 --> 1:18:12.100\n and let's not even be too careful\n\n1:18:12.100 --> 1:18:13.700\n about what these objects are.\n\n1:18:13.700 --> 1:18:15.780\n I can tell you there are gaol representations\n\n1:18:15.780 --> 1:18:18.420\n in modular forms, but saying those words\n\n1:18:18.420 --> 1:18:19.700\n is not gonna mean so much.\n\n1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:23.740\n But whatever they are, they're things that can be deformed,\n\n1:18:23.740 --> 1:18:25.940\n moved around a little bit.\n\n1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:28.460\n And I think the insight of what Andrew\n\n1:18:28.460 --> 1:18:31.300\n and then Andrew and Richard were able to do\n\n1:18:31.300 --> 1:18:33.700\n was to say something like this.\n\n1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:36.680\n A deformation means moving something just a tiny bit,\n\n1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:38.140\n like an infinitesimal amount.\n\n1:18:39.380 --> 1:18:41.460\n If you really are good at understanding\n\n1:18:41.460 --> 1:18:44.700\n which ways a thing can move in a tiny, tiny, tiny,\n\n1:18:44.700 --> 1:18:46.760\n infinitesimal amount in certain directions,\n\n1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:49.260\n maybe you can piece that information together\n\n1:18:49.260 --> 1:18:52.500\n to understand the whole global space in which it can move.\n\n1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.420\n And essentially, their argument comes down\n\n1:18:54.420 --> 1:18:57.320\n to showing that two of those big global spaces\n\n1:18:57.320 --> 1:19:00.060\n are actually the same, the fabled R equals T,\n\n1:19:00.060 --> 1:19:03.360\n part of their proof, which is at the heart of it.\n\n1:19:05.220 --> 1:19:09.540\n And it involves this very careful principle like that.\n\n1:19:09.540 --> 1:19:11.860\n But that being said, what I just said,\n\n1:19:12.900 --> 1:19:14.620\n it's probably not what you're thinking,\n\n1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:16.300\n because what you're thinking when you think,\n\n1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:18.500\n oh, I have a point in space and I move it around\n\n1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:19.700\n like a little tiny bit,\n\n1:19:22.220 --> 1:19:26.720\n you're using your notion of distance\n\n1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:28.300\n that's from calculus.\n\n1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:29.540\n We know what it means for like two points\n\n1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:32.960\n on the real line to be close together.\n\n1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:37.080\n So yet another thing that comes up in the book a lot\n\n1:19:37.080 --> 1:19:41.180\n is this fact that the notion of distance\n\n1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:42.620\n is not given to us by God.\n\n1:19:42.620 --> 1:19:44.620\n We could mean a lot of different things by distance.\n\n1:19:44.620 --> 1:19:46.500\n And just in the English language, we do that all the time.\n\n1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:49.020\n We talk about somebody being a close relative.\n\n1:19:49.020 --> 1:19:51.060\n It doesn't mean they live next door to you, right?\n\n1:19:51.060 --> 1:19:52.780\n It means something else.\n\n1:19:52.780 --> 1:19:54.840\n There's a different notion of distance we have in mind.\n\n1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:57.500\n And there are lots of notions of distances\n\n1:19:57.500 --> 1:19:58.820\n that you could use.\n\n1:19:58.820 --> 1:20:01.540\n In the natural language processing community and AI,\n\n1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:04.120\n there might be some notion of semantic distance\n\n1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:06.340\n or lexical distance between two words.\n\n1:20:06.340 --> 1:20:08.740\n How much do they tend to arise in the same context?\n\n1:20:08.740 --> 1:20:13.440\n That's incredibly important for doing autocomplete\n\n1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:15.440\n and like machine translation and stuff like that.\n\n1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:16.380\n And it doesn't have anything to do with\n\n1:20:16.380 --> 1:20:17.940\n are they next to each other in the dictionary, right?\n\n1:20:17.940 --> 1:20:19.260\n It's a different kind of distance.\n\n1:20:19.260 --> 1:20:20.100\n Okay, ready?\n\n1:20:20.100 --> 1:20:21.840\n In this kind of number theory,\n\n1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:25.100\n there was a crazy distance called the peatic distance.\n\n1:20:25.100 --> 1:20:26.740\n I didn't write about this that much in the book\n\n1:20:26.740 --> 1:20:27.580\n because even though I love it\n\n1:20:27.580 --> 1:20:28.620\n and it's a big part of my research life,\n\n1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:29.740\n it gets a little bit into the weeds,\n\n1:20:29.740 --> 1:20:32.500\n but your listeners are gonna hear about it now.\n\n1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:33.340\n Please.\n\n1:20:34.340 --> 1:20:35.900\n What a normal person says\n\n1:20:35.900 --> 1:20:37.700\n when they say two numbers are close,\n\n1:20:37.700 --> 1:20:40.220\n they say like their difference is like a small number,\n\n1:20:40.220 --> 1:20:41.660\n like seven and eight are close\n\n1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:44.300\n because their difference is one and one's pretty small.\n\n1:20:44.300 --> 1:20:48.580\n If we were to be what's called a two attic number theorist,\n\n1:20:48.580 --> 1:20:50.900\n we'd say, oh, two numbers are close\n\n1:20:50.900 --> 1:20:54.180\n if their difference is a multiple of a large power of two.\n\n1:20:55.660 --> 1:21:00.660\n So like one and 49 are close\n\n1:21:00.940 --> 1:21:02.980\n because their difference is 48\n\n1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:04.820\n and 48 is a multiple of 16,\n\n1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:06.700\n which is a pretty large power of two.\n\n1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:09.700\n Whereas one and two are pretty far away\n\n1:21:09.700 --> 1:21:12.460\n because the difference between them is one,\n\n1:21:12.460 --> 1:21:14.260\n which is not even a multiple of a power of two at all.\n\n1:21:14.260 --> 1:21:15.620\n That's odd.\n\n1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:17.700\n You wanna know what's really far from one?\n\n1:21:17.700 --> 1:21:20.540\n Like one and 1 64th\n\n1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:24.700\n because their difference is a negative power of two,\n\n1:21:24.700 --> 1:21:25.660\n two to the minus six.\n\n1:21:25.660 --> 1:21:28.220\n So those points are quite, quite far away.\n\n1:21:28.220 --> 1:21:32.220\n Two to the power of a large N would be two,\n\n1:21:33.740 --> 1:21:35.620\n if that's the difference between two numbers\n\n1:21:35.620 --> 1:21:37.140\n then they're close.\n\n1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:40.140\n Yeah, so two to a large power is in this metric\n\n1:21:40.140 --> 1:21:41.660\n a very small number\n\n1:21:41.660 --> 1:21:44.820\n and two to a negative power is a very big number.\n\n1:21:44.820 --> 1:21:45.660\n That's two attic.\n\n1:21:45.660 --> 1:21:48.700\n Okay, I can't even visualize that.\n\n1:21:48.700 --> 1:21:49.740\n It takes practice.\n\n1:21:49.740 --> 1:21:50.580\n It takes practice.\n\n1:21:50.580 --> 1:21:51.860\n If you've ever heard of the Cantor set,\n\n1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:53.220\n it looks kind of like that.\n\n1:21:54.100 --> 1:21:57.300\n So it is crazy that this is good for anything, right?\n\n1:21:57.300 --> 1:21:58.860\n I mean, this just sounds like a definition\n\n1:21:58.860 --> 1:22:00.660\n that someone would make up to torment you.\n\n1:22:00.660 --> 1:22:05.580\n But what's amazing is there's a general theory of distance\n\n1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:08.380\n where you say any definition you make\n\n1:22:08.380 --> 1:22:11.300\n to satisfy certain axioms deserves to be called a distance\n\n1:22:11.300 --> 1:22:12.140\n and this.\n\n1:22:12.140 --> 1:22:13.860\n See, I'm sorry to interrupt.\n\n1:22:13.860 --> 1:22:15.460\n My brain, you broke my brain.\n\n1:22:15.460 --> 1:22:16.540\n Awesome.\n\n1:22:16.540 --> 1:22:18.100\n 10 seconds ago.\n\n1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:21.500\n Cause I'm also starting to map for the two attic case\n\n1:22:21.500 --> 1:22:23.100\n to binary numbers.\n\n1:22:23.100 --> 1:22:25.300\n And you know, cause we romanticize those.\n\n1:22:25.300 --> 1:22:26.140\n So I was trying to.\n\n1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:27.260\n Oh, that's exactly the right way to think of it.\n\n1:22:27.260 --> 1:22:29.500\n I was trying to mess with number,\n\n1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:31.740\n I was trying to see, okay, which ones are close.\n\n1:22:31.740 --> 1:22:33.020\n And then I'm starting to visualize\n\n1:22:33.020 --> 1:22:35.620\n different binary numbers and how they,\n\n1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:37.300\n which ones are close to each other.\n\n1:22:37.300 --> 1:22:38.700\n And I'm not sure.\n\n1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:39.540\n Well, I think there's a.\n\n1:22:39.540 --> 1:22:40.580\n No, no, it's very similar.\n\n1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:41.980\n That's exactly the right way to think of it.\n\n1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:44.580\n It's almost like binary numbers written in reverse.\n\n1:22:44.580 --> 1:22:47.420\n Because in a binary expansion, two numbers are close.\n\n1:22:47.420 --> 1:22:50.860\n A number that's small is like 0.0000 something.\n\n1:22:50.860 --> 1:22:51.700\n Something that's the decimal\n\n1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:53.220\n and it starts with a lot of zeros.\n\n1:22:53.220 --> 1:22:56.860\n In the two attic metric, a binary number is very small\n\n1:22:56.860 --> 1:23:01.700\n if it ends with a lot of zeros and then the decimal point.\n\n1:23:01.700 --> 1:23:02.540\n Gotcha.\n\n1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:04.060\n So it is kind of like binary numbers written backwards\n\n1:23:04.060 --> 1:23:05.100\n is actually, I should have said,\n\n1:23:05.100 --> 1:23:07.420\n that's what I should have said, Lex.\n\n1:23:07.420 --> 1:23:08.780\n That's a very good metaphor.\n\n1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:12.020\n Okay, but so why is that interesting\n\n1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:17.020\n except for the fact that it's a beautiful kind of framework,\n\n1:23:18.380 --> 1:23:19.580\n different kind of framework\n\n1:23:19.580 --> 1:23:20.940\n of which to think about distances.\n\n1:23:20.940 --> 1:23:23.060\n And you're talking about not just the two attic,\n\n1:23:23.060 --> 1:23:24.220\n but the generalization of that.\n\n1:23:24.220 --> 1:23:25.060\n Why is that interesting?\n\n1:23:25.060 --> 1:23:25.900\n Yeah, the NEP.\n\n1:23:25.900 --> 1:23:27.580\n And so that, because that's the kind of deformation\n\n1:23:27.580 --> 1:23:31.700\n that comes up in Wiles's proof,\n\n1:23:31.700 --> 1:23:34.300\n that deformation where moving something a little bit\n\n1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:36.980\n means a little bit in this two attic sense.\n\n1:23:36.980 --> 1:23:38.060\n Trippy, okay.\n\n1:23:38.060 --> 1:23:38.900\n No, I mean, it's such a,\n\n1:23:38.900 --> 1:23:40.020\n I mean, I just get excited talking about it\n\n1:23:40.020 --> 1:23:42.940\n and I just taught this like in the fall semester that.\n\n1:23:43.980 --> 1:23:46.140\n But it like reformulating, why is,\n\n1:23:49.380 --> 1:23:52.780\n so you pick a different measure of distance\n\n1:23:53.740 --> 1:23:56.980\n over which you can talk about very tiny changes\n\n1:23:56.980 --> 1:23:59.660\n and then use that to then prove things\n\n1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:01.380\n about the entire thing.\n\n1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:05.060\n Yes, although, honestly, what I would say,\n\n1:24:05.060 --> 1:24:07.340\n I mean, it's true that we use it to prove things,\n\n1:24:07.340 --> 1:24:09.660\n but I would say we use it to understand things.\n\n1:24:09.660 --> 1:24:11.540\n And then because we understand things better,\n\n1:24:11.540 --> 1:24:12.620\n then we can prove things.\n\n1:24:12.620 --> 1:24:14.300\n But the goal is always the understanding.\n\n1:24:14.300 --> 1:24:16.900\n The goal is not so much to prove things.\n\n1:24:16.900 --> 1:24:18.820\n The goal is not to know what's true or false.\n\n1:24:18.820 --> 1:24:19.860\n I mean, this is something I write about\n\n1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:20.700\n in the book, Near the End.\n\n1:24:20.700 --> 1:24:21.540\n And it's something that,\n\n1:24:21.540 --> 1:24:25.460\n it's a wonderful, wonderful essay by Bill Thurston,\n\n1:24:25.460 --> 1:24:27.100\n kind of one of the great geometers of our time,\n\n1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:29.700\n who unfortunately passed away a few years ago,\n\n1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:32.900\n called on proof and progress in mathematics.\n\n1:24:32.900 --> 1:24:35.380\n And he writes very wonderfully about how,\n\n1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:38.100\n we're not, it's not a theorem factory\n\n1:24:38.100 --> 1:24:39.820\n where you have a production quota.\n\n1:24:39.820 --> 1:24:40.940\n I mean, the point of mathematics\n\n1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:43.580\n is to help humans understand things.\n\n1:24:43.580 --> 1:24:45.300\n And the way we test that\n\n1:24:45.300 --> 1:24:46.900\n is that we're proving new theorems along the way.\n\n1:24:46.900 --> 1:24:49.180\n That's the benchmark, but that's not the goal.\n\n1:24:49.180 --> 1:24:51.580\n Yeah, but just as a kind of, absolutely,\n\n1:24:51.580 --> 1:24:54.100\n but as a tool, it's kind of interesting\n\n1:24:54.100 --> 1:24:56.660\n to approach a problem by saying,\n\n1:24:56.660 --> 1:24:59.780\n how can I change the distance function?\n\n1:24:59.780 --> 1:25:03.700\n Like what, the nature of distance,\n\n1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:07.060\n because that might start to lead to insights\n\n1:25:07.060 --> 1:25:08.420\n for deeper understanding.\n\n1:25:08.420 --> 1:25:12.580\n Like if I were to try to describe human society\n\n1:25:12.580 --> 1:25:15.500\n by a distance, two people are close\n\n1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:17.140\n if they love each other.\n\n1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:17.980\n Right.\n\n1:25:17.980 --> 1:25:21.060\n And then start to do a full analysis\n\n1:25:21.060 --> 1:25:23.820\n on the everybody that lives on earth currently,\n\n1:25:23.820 --> 1:25:25.820\n the 7 billion people.\n\n1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:27.700\n And from that perspective,\n\n1:25:27.700 --> 1:25:30.860\n as opposed to the geographic perspective of distance.\n\n1:25:30.860 --> 1:25:32.980\n And then maybe there could be a bunch of insights\n\n1:25:32.980 --> 1:25:35.580\n about the source of violence,\n\n1:25:35.580 --> 1:25:39.260\n the source of maybe entrepreneurial success\n\n1:25:39.260 --> 1:25:42.980\n or invention or economic success or different systems,\n\n1:25:42.980 --> 1:25:44.660\n communism, capitalism start to,\n\n1:25:44.660 --> 1:25:47.460\n I mean, that's, I guess what economics tries to do,\n\n1:25:47.460 --> 1:25:50.500\n but really saying, okay, let's think outside the box\n\n1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:52.820\n about totally new distance functions\n\n1:25:52.820 --> 1:25:57.220\n that could unlock something profound about the space.\n\n1:25:57.220 --> 1:25:58.060\n Yeah, because think about it.\n\n1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:01.180\n Okay, here's, I mean, now we're gonna talk about AI,\n\n1:26:01.180 --> 1:26:02.980\n which you know a lot more about than I do.\n\n1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:05.820\n So just start laughing uproariously\n\n1:26:05.820 --> 1:26:07.060\n if I say something that's completely wrong.\n\n1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:09.860\n We both know very little relative\n\n1:26:09.860 --> 1:26:12.620\n to what we will know centuries from now.\n\n1:26:12.620 --> 1:26:15.700\n That is a really good humble way to think about it.\n\n1:26:15.700 --> 1:26:16.540\n I like it.\n\n1:26:16.540 --> 1:26:18.340\n Okay, so let's just go for it.\n\n1:26:18.340 --> 1:26:20.500\n Okay, so I think you'll agree with this,\n\n1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:23.020\n that in some sense, what's good about AI\n\n1:26:23.020 --> 1:26:26.340\n is that we can't test any case in advance,\n\n1:26:26.340 --> 1:26:27.820\n the whole point of AI is to make,\n\n1:26:27.820 --> 1:26:30.540\n or one point of it, I guess, is to make good predictions\n\n1:26:30.540 --> 1:26:32.620\n about cases we haven't yet seen.\n\n1:26:32.620 --> 1:26:34.820\n And in some sense, that's always gonna involve\n\n1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:35.980\n some notion of distance,\n\n1:26:35.980 --> 1:26:37.860\n because it's always gonna involve\n\n1:26:37.860 --> 1:26:40.060\n somehow taking a case we haven't seen\n\n1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:43.860\n and saying what cases that we have seen is it close to,\n\n1:26:43.860 --> 1:26:46.820\n is it like, is it somehow an interpolation between.\n\n1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:49.140\n Now, when we do that,\n\n1:26:49.140 --> 1:26:52.020\n in order to talk about things being like other things,\n\n1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:53.460\n implicitly or explicitly,\n\n1:26:53.460 --> 1:26:55.580\n we're invoking some notion of distance,\n\n1:26:55.580 --> 1:26:57.620\n and boy, we better get it right.\n\n1:26:57.620 --> 1:26:59.220\n If you try to do natural language processing\n\n1:26:59.220 --> 1:27:01.220\n and your idea of distance between words\n\n1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:03.180\n is how close they are in the dictionary,\n\n1:27:03.180 --> 1:27:04.460\n when you write them in alphabetical order,\n\n1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:08.180\n you are gonna get pretty bad translations, right?\n\n1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:11.580\n No, the notion of distance has to come from somewhere else.\n\n1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:14.180\n Yeah, that's essentially what neural networks are doing,\n\n1:27:14.180 --> 1:27:17.340\n that's what word embeddings are doing is coming up with.\n\n1:27:17.340 --> 1:27:18.980\n In the case of word embeddings, literally,\n\n1:27:18.980 --> 1:27:21.020\n literally what they are doing is learning a distance.\n\n1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:23.620\n But those are super complicated distance functions,\n\n1:27:23.620 --> 1:27:26.220\n and it's almost nice to think\n\n1:27:26.220 --> 1:27:31.220\n maybe there's a nice transformation that's simple.\n\n1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:34.460\n Sorry, there's a nice formulation of the distance.\n\n1:27:34.460 --> 1:27:36.540\n Again with the simple.\n\n1:27:36.540 --> 1:27:39.740\n So you don't, let me ask you about this.\n\n1:27:41.380 --> 1:27:43.380\n From an understanding perspective,\n\n1:27:43.380 --> 1:27:45.620\n there's the Richard Feynman, maybe attributed to him,\n\n1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:47.340\n but maybe many others,\n\n1:27:48.780 --> 1:27:52.460\n is this idea that if you can't explain something simply\n\n1:27:52.460 --> 1:27:54.100\n that you don't understand it.\n\n1:27:56.380 --> 1:28:00.700\n In how many cases, how often is that true?\n\n1:28:00.700 --> 1:28:03.100\n Do you find there's some profound truth in that?\n\n1:28:05.580 --> 1:28:07.700\n Oh, okay, so you were about to ask, is it true?\n\n1:28:07.700 --> 1:28:09.300\n To which I would say flatly, no.\n\n1:28:09.300 --> 1:28:11.260\n But then you said, you followed that up with,\n\n1:28:11.260 --> 1:28:13.220\n is there some profound truth in it?\n\n1:28:13.220 --> 1:28:14.140\n And I'm like, okay, sure.\n\n1:28:14.140 --> 1:28:15.420\n So there's some truth in it.\n\n1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:16.740\n It's not true. But it's not true.\n\n1:28:16.740 --> 1:28:17.740\n It's just not.\n\n1:28:17.740 --> 1:28:22.740\n That's such a mathematician answer.\n\n1:28:22.820 --> 1:28:25.740\n The truth that is in it is that learning\n\n1:28:25.740 --> 1:28:29.980\n to explain something helps you understand it.\n\n1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:32.600\n But real things are not simple.\n\n1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:36.660\n A few things are, most are not.\n\n1:28:36.660 --> 1:28:40.140\n And to be honest, we don't really know\n\n1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:41.300\n whether Feynman really said that right\n\n1:28:41.300 --> 1:28:43.060\n or something like that is sort of disputed.\n\n1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:46.180\n But I don't think Feynman could have literally believed that\n\n1:28:46.180 --> 1:28:47.220\n whether or not he said it.\n\n1:28:47.220 --> 1:28:49.620\n And he was the kind of guy, I didn't know him,\n\n1:28:49.620 --> 1:28:51.380\n but I've been reading his writing,\n\n1:28:51.380 --> 1:28:55.020\n he liked to sort of say stuff, like stuff that sounded good.\n\n1:28:55.020 --> 1:28:55.860\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:28:55.860 --> 1:28:57.640\n So it's totally strikes me as the kind of thing\n\n1:28:57.640 --> 1:29:00.200\n he could have said because he liked the way saying it\n\n1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:02.980\n made him feel, but also knowing\n\n1:29:02.980 --> 1:29:04.500\n that he didn't like literally mean it.\n\n1:29:04.500 --> 1:29:07.780\n Well, I definitely have a lot of friends\n\n1:29:07.780 --> 1:29:09.540\n and I've talked to a lot of physicists\n\n1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:12.740\n and they do derive joy from believing\n\n1:29:12.740 --> 1:29:14.540\n that they can explain stuff simply\n\n1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:17.820\n or believing it's possible to explain stuff simply,\n\n1:29:17.820 --> 1:29:20.180\n even when the explanation is not actually that simple.\n\n1:29:20.180 --> 1:29:23.940\n Like I've heard people think that the explanation is simple\n\n1:29:23.940 --> 1:29:25.060\n and they do the explanation.\n\n1:29:25.060 --> 1:29:27.600\n And I think it is simple,\n\n1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:30.580\n but it's not capturing the phenomena that we're discussing.\n\n1:29:30.580 --> 1:29:33.060\n It's capturing, it's somehow maps in their mind,\n\n1:29:33.060 --> 1:29:35.980\n but it's taking as a starting point,\n\n1:29:35.980 --> 1:29:38.180\n as an assumption that there's a deep knowledge\n\n1:29:38.180 --> 1:29:41.780\n and a deep understanding that's actually very complicated.\n\n1:29:41.780 --> 1:29:45.220\n And the simplicity is almost like a poem\n\n1:29:45.220 --> 1:29:46.820\n about the more complicated thing\n\n1:29:46.820 --> 1:29:48.700\n as opposed to a distillation.\n\n1:29:48.700 --> 1:29:51.860\n And I love poems, but a poem is not an explanation.\n\n1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:55.540\n Well, some people might disagree with that,\n\n1:29:55.540 --> 1:29:57.460\n but certainly from a mathematical perspective.\n\n1:29:57.460 --> 1:29:59.580\n No poet would disagree with it.\n\n1:29:59.580 --> 1:30:01.220\n No poet would disagree.\n\n1:30:01.220 --> 1:30:02.760\n You don't think there's some things\n\n1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:06.520\n that can only be described imprecisely?\n\n1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:07.500\n As an explanation.\n\n1:30:07.500 --> 1:30:09.700\n I don't think any poet would say their poem\n\n1:30:09.700 --> 1:30:10.540\n is an explanation.\n\n1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:11.820\n They might say it's a description.\n\n1:30:11.820 --> 1:30:14.440\n They might say it's sort of capturing sort of.\n\n1:30:14.440 --> 1:30:17.680\n Well, some people might say the only truth is like music.\n\n1:30:20.060 --> 1:30:20.940\n Not the only truth,\n\n1:30:20.940 --> 1:30:23.580\n but some truths can only be expressed through art.\n\n1:30:24.820 --> 1:30:26.380\n And I mean, that's the whole thing\n\n1:30:26.380 --> 1:30:27.700\n we're talking about religion and myth.\n\n1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:28.880\n And there's some things\n\n1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:32.340\n that are limited cognitive capabilities\n\n1:30:32.340 --> 1:30:35.180\n and the tools of mathematics or the tools of physics\n\n1:30:35.180 --> 1:30:37.340\n are just not going to allow us to capture.\n\n1:30:37.340 --> 1:30:39.900\n Like it's possible consciousness is one of those things.\n\n1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:40.740\n And.\n\n1:30:42.740 --> 1:30:44.600\n Yes, that is definitely possible.\n\n1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:46.100\n But I would even say,\n\n1:30:46.100 --> 1:30:47.500\n look, I mean, consciousness is a thing about\n\n1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:48.440\n which we're still in the dark\n\n1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:50.420\n as to whether there's an explanation\n\n1:30:50.420 --> 1:30:53.620\n we would understand it as an explanation at all.\n\n1:30:53.620 --> 1:30:54.440\n By the way, okay.\n\n1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:56.340\n I got to give yet one more amazing Poincare quote\n\n1:30:56.340 --> 1:30:57.700\n because this guy just never stopped coming up\n\n1:30:57.700 --> 1:30:58.900\n with great quotes that,\n\n1:31:00.660 --> 1:31:02.820\n Paul Erd\u0151s, another fellow who appears in the book.\n\n1:31:02.820 --> 1:31:03.660\n And by the way,\n\n1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.520\n he thinks about this notion of distance\n\n1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:07.540\n of like personal affinity,\n\n1:31:07.540 --> 1:31:08.540\n kind of like what you're talking about,\n\n1:31:08.540 --> 1:31:11.260\n the kind of social network and that notion of distance\n\n1:31:11.260 --> 1:31:12.100\n that comes from that.\n\n1:31:12.100 --> 1:31:13.300\n So that's something that Paul Erd\u0151s.\n\n1:31:13.300 --> 1:31:14.340\n Erd\u0151s did?\n\n1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:16.020\n Well, he thought about distances and networks.\n\n1:31:16.020 --> 1:31:16.840\n I guess he didn't probably,\n\n1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:17.680\n he didn't think about the social network.\n\n1:31:17.680 --> 1:31:18.520\n Oh, that's fascinating.\n\n1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:20.100\n And that's how it started that story of Erd\u0151s number.\n\n1:31:20.100 --> 1:31:20.940\n Yeah, okay.\n\n1:31:20.940 --> 1:31:22.700\n It's hard to distract.\n\n1:31:22.700 --> 1:31:25.100\n But you know, Erd\u0151s was sort of famous for saying,\n\n1:31:25.100 --> 1:31:26.860\n and this is sort of long lines we're saying,\n\n1:31:26.860 --> 1:31:28.420\n he talked about the book,\n\n1:31:28.420 --> 1:31:31.340\n capital T, capital B, the book.\n\n1:31:31.340 --> 1:31:33.460\n And that's the book where God keeps the right proof\n\n1:31:33.460 --> 1:31:34.740\n of every theorem.\n\n1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:36.380\n So when he saw a proof he really liked,\n\n1:31:36.380 --> 1:31:38.020\n it was like really elegant, really simple.\n\n1:31:38.020 --> 1:31:39.100\n Like that's from the book.\n\n1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:42.020\n That's like you found one of the ones that's in the book.\n\n1:31:43.180 --> 1:31:44.680\n He wasn't a religious guy, by the way.\n\n1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:46.900\n He referred to God as the supreme fascist.\n\n1:31:46.900 --> 1:31:48.800\n He was like, but somehow he was like,\n\n1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:49.720\n I don't really believe in God,\n\n1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:50.740\n but I believe in God's book.\n\n1:31:50.740 --> 1:31:51.580\n I mean, it was,\n\n1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:54.960\n but Poincare on the other hand,\n\n1:31:55.980 --> 1:31:57.020\n and by the way, there were other managers.\n\n1:31:57.020 --> 1:31:58.700\n Hilda Hudson is one who comes up in this book.\n\n1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:00.780\n She also kind of saw math.\n\n1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:03.900\n She's one of the people who sort of develops\n\n1:32:05.300 --> 1:32:06.880\n the disease model that we now use,\n\n1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:08.380\n that we use to sort of track pandemics,\n\n1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:10.380\n this SIR model that sort of originally comes\n\n1:32:10.380 --> 1:32:11.940\n from her work with Ronald Ross.\n\n1:32:11.940 --> 1:32:14.500\n But she was also super, super, super devout.\n\n1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:17.380\n And she also sort of on the other side\n\n1:32:17.380 --> 1:32:18.320\n of the religious coin was like,\n\n1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:20.460\n yeah, math is how we communicate with God.\n\n1:32:20.460 --> 1:32:21.300\n She has a great,\n\n1:32:21.300 --> 1:32:22.560\n all these people are incredibly quotable.\n\n1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:24.680\n She says, you know, math is,\n\n1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:26.620\n the truth, the things about mathematics,\n\n1:32:26.620 --> 1:32:29.460\n she's like, they're not the most important of God thoughts,\n\n1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:32.620\n but they're the only ones that we can know precisely.\n\n1:32:32.620 --> 1:32:34.020\n So she's like, this is the one place\n\n1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:35.460\n where we get to sort of see what God's thinking\n\n1:32:35.460 --> 1:32:37.380\n when we do mathematics.\n\n1:32:37.380 --> 1:32:39.160\n Again, not a fan of poetry or music.\n\n1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:41.020\n Some people will say Hendrix is like,\n\n1:32:41.020 --> 1:32:44.340\n some people say chapter one of that book is mathematics,\n\n1:32:44.340 --> 1:32:46.860\n and then chapter two is like classic rock.\n\n1:32:46.860 --> 1:32:48.580\n Right?\n\n1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:51.380\n So like, it's not clear that the...\n\n1:32:51.380 --> 1:32:52.740\n I'm sorry, you just sent me off on a tangent,\n\n1:32:52.740 --> 1:32:54.940\n just imagining like Erdos at a Hendrix concert,\n\n1:32:54.940 --> 1:32:58.500\n like trying to figure out if it was from the book or not.\n\n1:32:59.740 --> 1:33:00.980\n What I was coming to was just to say,\n\n1:33:00.980 --> 1:33:03.100\n but what Poincar\u00e9 said about this is he's like,\n\n1:33:03.100 --> 1:33:07.400\n you know, if like, this is all worked out\n\n1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:08.460\n in the language of the divine,\n\n1:33:08.460 --> 1:33:12.460\n and if a divine being like came down and told it to us,\n\n1:33:12.460 --> 1:33:15.020\n we wouldn't be able to understand it, so it doesn't matter.\n\n1:33:15.020 --> 1:33:17.400\n So Poincar\u00e9 was of the view that there were things\n\n1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:19.340\n that were sort of like inhumanly complex,\n\n1:33:19.340 --> 1:33:21.060\n and that was how they really were.\n\n1:33:21.060 --> 1:33:23.780\n Our job is to figure out the things that are not like that.\n\n1:33:23.780 --> 1:33:25.600\n That are not like that.\n\n1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:28.500\n All this talk of primes got me hungry for primes.\n\n1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:32.580\n You wrote a blog post, The Beauty of Bounding Gaps,\n\n1:33:32.580 --> 1:33:35.260\n a huge discovery about prime numbers\n\n1:33:35.260 --> 1:33:37.300\n and what it means for the future of math.\n\n1:33:39.140 --> 1:33:40.820\n Can you tell me about prime numbers?\n\n1:33:40.820 --> 1:33:41.860\n What the heck are those?\n\n1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:42.820\n What are twin primes?\n\n1:33:42.820 --> 1:33:43.740\n What are prime gaps?\n\n1:33:43.740 --> 1:33:46.760\n What are bounding gaps and primes?\n\n1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:47.820\n What are all these things?\n\n1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:49.820\n And what, if anything,\n\n1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:52.100\n or what exactly is beautiful about them?\n\n1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:57.100\n Yeah, so, you know, prime numbers are one of the things\n\n1:33:57.100 --> 1:34:02.100\n that number theorists study the most and have for millennia.\n\n1:34:02.820 --> 1:34:06.220\n They are numbers which can't be factored.\n\n1:34:06.220 --> 1:34:08.140\n And then you say, like, five.\n\n1:34:08.140 --> 1:34:09.780\n And then you're like, wait, I can factor five.\n\n1:34:09.780 --> 1:34:11.820\n Five is five times one.\n\n1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:13.500\n Okay, not like that.\n\n1:34:13.500 --> 1:34:14.540\n That is a factorization.\n\n1:34:14.540 --> 1:34:16.700\n It absolutely is a way of expressing five\n\n1:34:16.700 --> 1:34:18.380\n as a product of two things.\n\n1:34:18.380 --> 1:34:20.900\n But don't you agree there's like something trivial about it?\n\n1:34:20.900 --> 1:34:22.300\n It's something you could do to any number.\n\n1:34:22.300 --> 1:34:24.340\n It doesn't have content the way that if I say\n\n1:34:24.340 --> 1:34:27.640\n that 12 is six times two or 35 is seven times five,\n\n1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:28.960\n I've really done something to it.\n\n1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:29.800\n I've broken up.\n\n1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:31.700\n So those are the kind of factorizations that count.\n\n1:34:31.700 --> 1:34:34.460\n And a number that doesn't have a factorization like that\n\n1:34:34.460 --> 1:34:38.100\n is called prime, except, historical side note,\n\n1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:42.440\n one, which at some times in mathematical history\n\n1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:46.040\n has been deemed to be a prime, but currently is not.\n\n1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:47.140\n And I think that's for the best.\n\n1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:49.580\n But I bring it up only because sometimes people think that,\n\n1:34:49.580 --> 1:34:52.220\n you know, these definitions are kind of,\n\n1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:53.500\n if we think about them hard enough,\n\n1:34:53.500 --> 1:34:55.640\n we can figure out which definition is true.\n\n1:34:56.780 --> 1:34:57.620\n No.\n\n1:34:57.620 --> 1:34:58.820\n There's just an artifact of mathematics.\n\n1:34:58.820 --> 1:35:03.460\n So it's a question of which definition is best for us,\n\n1:35:03.460 --> 1:35:04.300\n for our purposes.\n\n1:35:04.300 --> 1:35:06.020\n Well, those edge cases are weird, right?\n\n1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:11.020\n So it can't be, it doesn't count when you use yourself\n\n1:35:11.700 --> 1:35:15.000\n as a number or one as part of the factorization\n\n1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.320\n or as the entirety of the factorization.\n\n1:35:19.320 --> 1:35:22.920\n So you somehow get to the meat of the number\n\n1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:24.180\n by factorizing it.\n\n1:35:24.180 --> 1:35:27.420\n And that seems to get to the core of all of mathematics.\n\n1:35:27.420 --> 1:35:29.940\n Yeah, you take any number and you factorize it\n\n1:35:29.940 --> 1:35:31.440\n until you can factorize no more.\n\n1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:33.900\n And what you have left is some big pile of primes.\n\n1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:36.380\n I mean, by definition, when you can't factor anymore,\n\n1:35:36.380 --> 1:35:39.020\n when you're done, when you can't break the numbers up\n\n1:35:39.020 --> 1:35:40.900\n anymore, what's left must be prime.\n\n1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:44.460\n You know, 12 breaks into two and two and three.\n\n1:35:45.580 --> 1:35:48.220\n So these numbers are the atoms, the building blocks\n\n1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:49.380\n of all numbers.\n\n1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:52.180\n And there's a lot we know about them,\n\n1:35:52.180 --> 1:35:53.420\n or there's much more that we don't know about them.\n\n1:35:53.420 --> 1:35:54.340\n I'll tell you the first few.\n\n1:35:54.340 --> 1:35:58.160\n There's two, three, five, seven, 11.\n\n1:35:59.140 --> 1:36:00.780\n By the way, they're all gonna be odd from then on\n\n1:36:00.780 --> 1:36:02.020\n because if they were even, I could factor out\n\n1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:03.060\n two out of them.\n\n1:36:03.060 --> 1:36:04.300\n But it's not all the odd numbers.\n\n1:36:04.300 --> 1:36:06.440\n Nine isn't prime because it's three times three.\n\n1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:08.180\n 15 isn't prime because it's three times five,\n\n1:36:08.180 --> 1:36:09.000\n but 13 is.\n\n1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:09.840\n Where were we?\n\n1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:13.820\n Two, three, five, seven, 11, 13, 17, 19.\n\n1:36:13.820 --> 1:36:15.940\n Not 21, but 23 is, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:36:15.940 --> 1:36:17.060\n Okay, so you could go on.\n\n1:36:17.060 --> 1:36:19.580\n How high could you go if we were just sitting here?\n\n1:36:19.580 --> 1:36:20.980\n By the way, your own brain.\n\n1:36:20.980 --> 1:36:23.980\n If continuous, without interruption,\n\n1:36:23.980 --> 1:36:25.980\n would you be able to go over 100?\n\n1:36:25.980 --> 1:36:27.140\n I think so.\n\n1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:29.100\n There's always those ones that trip people up.\n\n1:36:29.100 --> 1:36:31.780\n There's a famous one, the Grotendeek prime 57,\n\n1:36:31.780 --> 1:36:33.380\n like sort of Alexander Grotendeek,\n\n1:36:33.380 --> 1:36:35.740\n the great algebraic geometer was sort of giving\n\n1:36:35.740 --> 1:36:38.740\n some lecture involving a choice of a prime in general.\n\n1:36:38.740 --> 1:36:41.500\n And somebody said, can't you just choose a prime?\n\n1:36:41.500 --> 1:36:43.540\n And he said, okay, 57, which is in fact not prime.\n\n1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:45.800\n It's three times 19.\n\n1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:46.640\n Oh, damn.\n\n1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:49.300\n But it was like, I promise you in some circles\n\n1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:50.140\n it's a funny story.\n\n1:36:50.140 --> 1:36:55.140\n But there's a humor in it.\n\n1:36:55.740 --> 1:36:59.220\n Yes, I would say over 100, I definitely don't remember.\n\n1:36:59.220 --> 1:37:02.100\n Like 107, I think, I'm not sure.\n\n1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:03.460\n Okay, like, I mean.\n\n1:37:03.460 --> 1:37:08.460\n So is there a category of like fake primes\n\n1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:12.900\n that are easily mistaken to be prime?\n\n1:37:12.900 --> 1:37:14.660\n Like 57, I wonder.\n\n1:37:14.660 --> 1:37:19.660\n Yeah, so I would say 57 and 51 are definitely\n\n1:37:20.740 --> 1:37:21.900\n like prime offenders.\n\n1:37:21.900 --> 1:37:23.060\n Oh, I didn't do that on purpose.\n\n1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:24.300\n Oh, well done.\n\n1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:25.340\n Didn't do it on purpose.\n\n1:37:25.340 --> 1:37:28.180\n Anyway, they're definitely ones that people,\n\n1:37:28.180 --> 1:37:30.700\n or 91 is another classic, seven times 13.\n\n1:37:30.700 --> 1:37:32.900\n It really feels kind of prime, doesn't it?\n\n1:37:32.900 --> 1:37:34.020\n But it is not.\n\n1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:34.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:35.820 --> 1:37:36.900\n But there's also, by the way,\n\n1:37:36.900 --> 1:37:39.600\n but there's also an actual notion of pseudo prime,\n\n1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:41.460\n which is a thing with a formal definition,\n\n1:37:41.460 --> 1:37:43.380\n which is not a psychological thing.\n\n1:37:43.380 --> 1:37:47.540\n It is a prime which passes a primality test\n\n1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:50.380\n devised by Fermat, which is a very good test,\n\n1:37:50.380 --> 1:37:52.540\n which if a number fails this test,\n\n1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:54.580\n it's definitely not prime.\n\n1:37:54.580 --> 1:37:55.600\n And so there was some hope that,\n\n1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:57.280\n oh, maybe if a number passes the test,\n\n1:37:57.280 --> 1:37:58.420\n then it definitely is prime.\n\n1:37:58.420 --> 1:38:00.660\n That would give a very simple criterion for primality.\n\n1:38:00.660 --> 1:38:03.980\n Unfortunately, it's only perfect in one direction.\n\n1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:08.980\n So there are numbers, I want to say 341 is the smallest,\n\n1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:12.380\n which pass the test but are not prime, 341.\n\n1:38:12.380 --> 1:38:14.780\n Is this test easily explainable or no?\n\n1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:15.860\n Yes, actually.\n\n1:38:16.820 --> 1:38:18.300\n Ready, let me give you the simplest version of it.\n\n1:38:18.300 --> 1:38:21.100\n You can dress it up a little bit, but here's the basic idea.\n\n1:38:22.660 --> 1:38:25.180\n I take the number, the mystery number,\n\n1:38:25.180 --> 1:38:27.340\n I raise two to that power.\n\n1:38:29.540 --> 1:38:32.780\n So let's say your mystery number is six.\n\n1:38:32.780 --> 1:38:33.900\n Are you sorry you asked me?\n\n1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:34.740\n Are you ready?\n\n1:38:34.740 --> 1:38:37.140\n No, you're breaking my brain again, but yes.\n\n1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:38.220\n Let's do it.\n\n1:38:38.220 --> 1:38:40.220\n We're going to do a live demonstration.\n\n1:38:40.220 --> 1:38:43.340\n Let's say your number is six.\n\n1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:45.980\n So I'm going to raise two to the sixth power.\n\n1:38:45.980 --> 1:38:46.820\n Okay, so if I were working on it,\n\n1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:48.660\n I'd be like that's two cubes squared,\n\n1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:51.680\n so that's eight times eight, so that's 64.\n\n1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:53.520\n Now we're going to divide by six,\n\n1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:54.980\n but I don't actually care what the quotient is,\n\n1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:56.100\n only the remainder.\n\n1:38:57.300 --> 1:39:01.420\n So let's see, 64 divided by six is,\n\n1:39:01.420 --> 1:39:04.520\n well, there's a quotient of 10, but the remainder is four.\n\n1:39:05.460 --> 1:39:08.640\n So you failed because the answer has to be two.\n\n1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:13.260\n For any prime, let's do it with five, which is prime.\n\n1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:15.580\n Two to the fifth is 32.\n\n1:39:15.580 --> 1:39:20.580\n Divide 32 by five, and you get six with a remainder of two.\n\n1:39:23.100 --> 1:39:24.220\n With a remainder of two, yeah.\n\n1:39:24.220 --> 1:39:26.700\n For seven, two to the seventh is 128.\n\n1:39:26.700 --> 1:39:29.480\n Divide that by seven, and let's see,\n\n1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:32.340\n I think that's seven times 14, is that right?\n\n1:39:32.340 --> 1:39:33.160\n No.\n\n1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:38.160\n Seven times 18 is 126 with a remainder of two, right?\n\n1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:43.360\n 128 is a multiple of seven plus two.\n\n1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:46.520\n So if that remainder is not two,\n\n1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:49.480\n then it's definitely not prime.\n\n1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:53.320\n And then if it is, it's likely a prime, but not for sure.\n\n1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:54.660\n It's likely a prime, but not for sure.\n\n1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:56.280\n And there's actually a beautiful geometric proof\n\n1:39:56.280 --> 1:39:57.240\n which is in the book, actually.\n\n1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:58.720\n That's like one of the most granular parts of the book\n\n1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:00.440\n because it's such a beautiful proof, I couldn't not give it.\n\n1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:05.400\n So you draw a lot of like opal and pearl necklaces\n\n1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:06.240\n and spin them.\n\n1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:07.440\n That's kind of the geometric nature\n\n1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:10.000\n of this proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\n1:40:11.920 --> 1:40:13.680\n So yeah, so with pseudo primes,\n\n1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:14.760\n there are primes that are kind of faking it.\n\n1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:16.560\n They pass that test, but there are numbers\n\n1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:17.960\n that are faking it that pass that test,\n\n1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:19.260\n but are not actually prime.\n\n1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:25.680\n But the point is, there are many, many,\n\n1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.900\n many theorems about prime numbers.\n\n1:40:28.900 --> 1:40:32.100\n There's a bunch of questions to ask.\n\n1:40:32.100 --> 1:40:34.660\n Is there an infinite number of primes?\n\n1:40:34.660 --> 1:40:37.460\n Can we say something about the gap between primes\n\n1:40:37.460 --> 1:40:40.940\n as the numbers grow larger and larger and larger and so on?\n\n1:40:40.940 --> 1:40:43.200\n Yeah, it's a perfect example of your desire\n\n1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:44.620\n for simplicity in all things.\n\n1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:46.300\n You know what would be really simple?\n\n1:40:46.300 --> 1:40:48.780\n If there was only finitely many primes\n\n1:40:48.780 --> 1:40:51.540\n and then there would be this finite set of atoms\n\n1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:53.860\n that all numbers would be built up.\n\n1:40:53.860 --> 1:40:56.860\n That would be very simple and good in certain ways,\n\n1:40:56.860 --> 1:40:58.860\n but it's completely false.\n\n1:40:58.860 --> 1:41:00.220\n And number theory would be totally different\n\n1:41:00.220 --> 1:41:01.040\n if that were the case.\n\n1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:01.880\n It's just not true.\n\n1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:04.700\n In fact, this is something else that Euclid knew.\n\n1:41:04.700 --> 1:41:07.540\n So this is a very, very old fact,\n\n1:41:07.540 --> 1:41:10.340\n like much before, long before we've had anything\n\n1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:11.180\n like modern number theory.\n\n1:41:11.180 --> 1:41:12.140\n The primes are infinite.\n\n1:41:12.140 --> 1:41:14.020\n The primes that there are, right.\n\n1:41:14.020 --> 1:41:15.460\n There's an infinite number of primes.\n\n1:41:15.460 --> 1:41:17.740\n So what about the gaps between the primes?\n\n1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:20.460\n Right, so one thing that people recognized\n\n1:41:20.460 --> 1:41:22.220\n and really thought about a lot is that the primes,\n\n1:41:22.220 --> 1:41:25.840\n on average, seem to get farther and farther apart\n\n1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:27.020\n as they get bigger and bigger.\n\n1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:29.140\n In other words, it's less and less common.\n\n1:41:29.140 --> 1:41:31.140\n Like I already told you of the first 10 numbers,\n\n1:41:31.140 --> 1:41:32.940\n two, three, five, seven, four of them are prime.\n\n1:41:32.940 --> 1:41:34.700\n That's a lot, 40%.\n\n1:41:34.700 --> 1:41:38.540\n If I looked at 10 digit numbers,\n\n1:41:38.540 --> 1:41:40.620\n no way would 40% of those be prime.\n\n1:41:40.620 --> 1:41:42.020\n Being prime would be a lot rarer.\n\n1:41:42.020 --> 1:41:43.940\n In some sense, because there's a lot more things\n\n1:41:43.940 --> 1:41:45.860\n for them to be divisible by.\n\n1:41:45.860 --> 1:41:47.140\n That's one way of thinking of it.\n\n1:41:47.140 --> 1:41:49.420\n It's a lot more possible for there to be a factorization\n\n1:41:49.420 --> 1:41:50.380\n because there's a lot of things\n\n1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:52.140\n you can try to factor out of it.\n\n1:41:52.140 --> 1:41:53.420\n As the numbers get bigger and bigger,\n\n1:41:53.420 --> 1:41:58.420\n primality gets rarer and rarer, and the extent\n\n1:41:58.820 --> 1:42:01.700\n to which that's the case, that's pretty well understood.\n\n1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:03.840\n But then you can ask more fine grained questions,\n\n1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:04.880\n and here is one.\n\n1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:11.740\n A twin prime is a pair of primes that are two apart,\n\n1:42:11.740 --> 1:42:16.740\n like three and five, or like 11 and 13, or like 17 and 19.\n\n1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:18.900\n And one thing we still don't know\n\n1:42:18.900 --> 1:42:21.960\n is are there infinitely many of those?\n\n1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:24.100\n We know on average, they get farther and farther apart,\n\n1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:28.140\n but that doesn't mean there couldn't be occasional folks\n\n1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:30.180\n that come close together.\n\n1:42:30.180 --> 1:42:32.940\n And indeed, we think that there are.\n\n1:42:33.820 --> 1:42:36.060\n And one interesting question, I mean, this is,\n\n1:42:37.300 --> 1:42:38.140\n because I think you might say,\n\n1:42:38.140 --> 1:42:41.060\n well, how could one possibly have a right\n\n1:42:41.060 --> 1:42:44.020\n to have an opinion about something like that?\n\n1:42:44.020 --> 1:42:46.380\n We don't have any way of describing a process\n\n1:42:46.380 --> 1:42:48.460\n that makes primes.\n\n1:42:49.540 --> 1:42:51.480\n Sure, you can look at your computer\n\n1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:53.860\n and see a lot of them, but the fact that there's a lot,\n\n1:42:53.860 --> 1:42:55.940\n why is that evidence that there's infinitely many, right?\n\n1:42:55.940 --> 1:42:57.660\n Maybe I can go on the computer and find 10 million.\n\n1:42:57.660 --> 1:42:59.940\n Well, 10 million is pretty far from infinity, right?\n\n1:42:59.940 --> 1:43:01.620\n So how is that evidence?\n\n1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:02.520\n There's a lot of things.\n\n1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.180\n There's like a lot more than 10 million atoms.\n\n1:43:04.180 --> 1:43:05.500\n That doesn't mean there's infinitely many atoms\n\n1:43:05.500 --> 1:43:06.340\n in the universe, right?\n\n1:43:06.340 --> 1:43:07.740\n I mean, on most people's physical theories,\n\n1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:10.180\n there's probably not, as I understand it.\n\n1:43:10.180 --> 1:43:13.240\n Okay, so why would we think this?\n\n1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:17.460\n The answer is that it turns out to be like incredibly\n\n1:43:17.460 --> 1:43:21.840\n productive and enlightening to think about primes\n\n1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:23.260\n as if they were random numbers,\n\n1:43:23.260 --> 1:43:24.900\n as if they were randomly distributed\n\n1:43:24.900 --> 1:43:26.060\n according to a certain law.\n\n1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:27.740\n Now they're not, they're not random.\n\n1:43:27.740 --> 1:43:28.740\n There's no chance involved.\n\n1:43:28.740 --> 1:43:30.140\n There it's completely deterministic\n\n1:43:30.140 --> 1:43:31.620\n whether a number is prime or not.\n\n1:43:31.620 --> 1:43:35.420\n And yet it just turns out to be phenomenally useful\n\n1:43:35.420 --> 1:43:38.100\n in mathematics to say,\n\n1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:41.740\n even if something is governed by a deterministic law,\n\n1:43:41.740 --> 1:43:43.100\n let's just pretend it wasn't.\n\n1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:44.460\n Let's just pretend that they were produced\n\n1:43:44.460 --> 1:43:46.560\n by some random process and see if the behavior\n\n1:43:46.560 --> 1:43:47.940\n is roughly the same.\n\n1:43:47.940 --> 1:43:49.620\n And if it's not, maybe change the random process,\n\n1:43:49.620 --> 1:43:51.100\n maybe make the randomness a little bit different\n\n1:43:51.100 --> 1:43:53.820\n and tweak it and see if you can find a random process\n\n1:43:53.820 --> 1:43:55.380\n that matches the behavior we see.\n\n1:43:55.380 --> 1:43:58.460\n And then maybe you predict that other behaviors\n\n1:44:00.140 --> 1:44:02.900\n of the system are like that of the random process.\n\n1:44:02.900 --> 1:44:04.060\n And so that's kind of like, it's funny\n\n1:44:04.060 --> 1:44:05.260\n because I think when you talk to people\n\n1:44:05.260 --> 1:44:07.420\n at the twin prime conjecture,\n\n1:44:07.420 --> 1:44:09.940\n people think you're saying,\n\n1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:12.420\n wow, there's like some deep structure there\n\n1:44:12.420 --> 1:44:15.180\n that like makes those primes be like close together\n\n1:44:15.180 --> 1:44:16.020\n again and again.\n\n1:44:16.020 --> 1:44:18.300\n And no, it's the opposite of deep structure.\n\n1:44:18.300 --> 1:44:20.860\n What we say when we say we believe the twin prime conjecture\n\n1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:22.860\n is that we believe the primes are like sort of\n\n1:44:22.860 --> 1:44:24.580\n strewn around pretty randomly.\n\n1:44:24.580 --> 1:44:26.100\n And if they were, then by chance,\n\n1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:28.180\n you would expect there to be infinitely many twin primes.\n\n1:44:28.180 --> 1:44:29.660\n And we're saying, yeah, we expect them to behave\n\n1:44:29.660 --> 1:44:31.900\n just like they would if they were random dirt.\n\n1:44:33.140 --> 1:44:35.340\n The fascinating parallel here is,\n\n1:44:36.180 --> 1:44:38.420\n I just got a chance to talk to Sam Harris\n\n1:44:38.420 --> 1:44:41.300\n and he uses the prime numbers as an example.\n\n1:44:41.300 --> 1:44:44.940\n Often, I don't know if you're familiar with who Sam is.\n\n1:44:44.940 --> 1:44:49.280\n He uses that as an example of there being no free will.\n\n1:44:50.380 --> 1:44:52.380\n Wait, where does he get this?\n\n1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:54.820\n Well, he just uses as an example of,\n\n1:44:54.820 --> 1:44:58.460\n it might seem like this is a random number generator,\n\n1:44:58.460 --> 1:45:01.780\n but it's all like formally defined.\n\n1:45:01.780 --> 1:45:05.120\n So if we keep getting more and more primes,\n\n1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:09.180\n then like that might feel like a new discovery\n\n1:45:09.180 --> 1:45:12.160\n and that might feel like a new experience, but it's not.\n\n1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:14.340\n It was always written in the cards.\n\n1:45:14.340 --> 1:45:15.700\n But it's funny that you say that\n\n1:45:15.700 --> 1:45:18.320\n because a lot of people think of like randomness,\n\n1:45:19.580 --> 1:45:23.420\n the fundamental randomness within the nature of reality\n\n1:45:23.420 --> 1:45:25.900\n might be the source of something\n\n1:45:25.900 --> 1:45:27.780\n that we experience as free will.\n\n1:45:27.780 --> 1:45:30.180\n And you're saying it's like useful to look at prime numbers\n\n1:45:30.180 --> 1:45:35.180\n as a random process in order to prove stuff about them.\n\n1:45:35.620 --> 1:45:38.820\n But fundamentally, of course, it's not a random process.\n\n1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:40.900\n Well, not in order to prove some stuff about them\n\n1:45:40.900 --> 1:45:43.740\n so much as to figure out what we expect to be true\n\n1:45:43.740 --> 1:45:44.940\n and then try to prove that.\n\n1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:45.900\n Because here's what you don't want to do.\n\n1:45:45.900 --> 1:45:48.340\n Try really hard to prove something that's false.\n\n1:45:48.340 --> 1:45:51.100\n That makes it really hard to prove the thing if it's false.\n\n1:45:51.100 --> 1:45:53.020\n So you certainly want to have some heuristic ways\n\n1:45:53.020 --> 1:45:55.120\n of guessing, making good guesses about what's true.\n\n1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:56.660\n So yeah, here's what I would say.\n\n1:45:56.660 --> 1:45:58.740\n You're going to be imaginary Sam Harris now.\n\n1:45:58.740 --> 1:46:00.980\n Like you are talking about prime numbers\n\n1:46:00.980 --> 1:46:01.860\n and you are like,\n\n1:46:01.860 --> 1:46:04.000\n but prime numbers are completely deterministic.\n\n1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:04.840\n And I'm saying like,\n\n1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:06.940\n well, but let's treat them like a random process.\n\n1:46:06.940 --> 1:46:08.240\n And then you say,\n\n1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:09.580\n but you're just saying something that's not true.\n\n1:46:09.580 --> 1:46:10.900\n They're not a random process, they're deterministic.\n\n1:46:10.900 --> 1:46:11.860\n And I'm like, okay, great.\n\n1:46:11.860 --> 1:46:13.940\n You hold to your insistence that it's not a random process.\n\n1:46:13.940 --> 1:46:15.860\n Meanwhile, I'm generating insight about the primes\n\n1:46:15.860 --> 1:46:17.740\n that you're not because I'm willing to sort of pretend\n\n1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:18.660\n that there's something that they're not\n\n1:46:18.660 --> 1:46:20.440\n in order to understand what's going on.\n\n1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:22.920\n Yeah, so it doesn't matter what the reality is.\n\n1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:27.920\n What matters is what framework of thought\n\n1:46:28.220 --> 1:46:30.780\n results in the maximum number of insights.\n\n1:46:30.780 --> 1:46:32.380\n Yeah, because I feel, look, I'm sorry,\n\n1:46:32.380 --> 1:46:34.180\n but I feel like you have more insights about people.\n\n1:46:34.180 --> 1:46:37.980\n If you think of them as like beings that have wants\n\n1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:40.860\n and needs and desires and do stuff on purpose,\n\n1:46:40.860 --> 1:46:41.820\n even if that's not true,\n\n1:46:41.820 --> 1:46:43.500\n you still understand better what's going on\n\n1:46:43.500 --> 1:46:44.620\n by treating them in that way.\n\n1:46:44.620 --> 1:46:46.480\n Don't you find, look, when you work on machine learning,\n\n1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:48.020\n don't you find yourself sort of talking\n\n1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.500\n about what the machine is trying to do\n\n1:46:51.500 --> 1:46:52.780\n in a certain instance?\n\n1:46:52.780 --> 1:46:54.940\n Do you not find yourself drawn to that language?\n\n1:46:54.940 --> 1:46:57.700\n Well, it knows this, it's trying to do that,\n\n1:46:57.700 --> 1:46:58.980\n it's learning that.\n\n1:46:58.980 --> 1:47:00.980\n I'm certainly drawn to that language\n\n1:47:00.980 --> 1:47:03.380\n to the point where I receive quite a bit of criticisms\n\n1:47:03.380 --> 1:47:05.420\n for it because I, you know, like.\n\n1:47:05.420 --> 1:47:07.020\n Oh, I'm on your side, man.\n\n1:47:07.020 --> 1:47:09.740\n So especially in robotics, I don't know why,\n\n1:47:09.740 --> 1:47:14.260\n but robotics people don't like to name their robots.\n\n1:47:14.260 --> 1:47:17.020\n They certainly don't like to gender their robots\n\n1:47:17.020 --> 1:47:18.780\n because the moment you gender a robot,\n\n1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:20.580\n you start to anthropomorphize.\n\n1:47:20.580 --> 1:47:22.940\n If you say he or she, you start to,\n\n1:47:22.940 --> 1:47:27.340\n in your mind, construct like a life story.\n\n1:47:27.340 --> 1:47:29.020\n In your mind, you can't help it.\n\n1:47:29.020 --> 1:47:31.520\n There's like, you create like a humorous story\n\n1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:32.360\n to this person.\n\n1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:35.580\n You start to, this person, this robot,\n\n1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:37.300\n you start to project your own.\n\n1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:38.780\n But I think that's what we do to each other.\n\n1:47:38.780 --> 1:47:40.500\n And I think that's actually really useful\n\n1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:42.620\n for the engineering process,\n\n1:47:42.620 --> 1:47:44.580\n especially for human robot interaction.\n\n1:47:44.580 --> 1:47:46.620\n And yes, for machine learning systems,\n\n1:47:46.620 --> 1:47:48.020\n for helping you build an intuition\n\n1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:49.900\n about a particular problem.\n\n1:47:49.900 --> 1:47:51.920\n It's almost like asking this question,\n\n1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:55.940\n you know, when a machine learning system fails\n\n1:47:55.940 --> 1:47:57.960\n in a particular edge case, asking like,\n\n1:47:57.960 --> 1:47:59.820\n what were you thinking about?\n\n1:47:59.820 --> 1:48:02.020\n Like, like asking, like almost like\n\n1:48:02.020 --> 1:48:04.540\n when you're talking about to a child\n\n1:48:04.540 --> 1:48:08.580\n who just did something bad, you want to understand\n\n1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:12.060\n like what was, how did they see the world?\n\n1:48:12.060 --> 1:48:13.980\n Maybe there's a totally new, maybe you're the one\n\n1:48:13.980 --> 1:48:16.820\n that's thinking about the world incorrectly.\n\n1:48:16.820 --> 1:48:19.900\n And yeah, that anthropomorphization process,\n\n1:48:19.900 --> 1:48:21.380\n I think is ultimately good for insight.\n\n1:48:21.380 --> 1:48:23.620\n And the same is, I agree with you.\n\n1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:26.660\n I tend to believe about free will as well.\n\n1:48:26.660 --> 1:48:28.900\n Let me ask you a ridiculous question, if it's okay.\n\n1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:30.260\n Of course.\n\n1:48:30.260 --> 1:48:34.420\n I've just recently, most people go on like rabbit hole,\n\n1:48:34.420 --> 1:48:35.660\n like YouTube things.\n\n1:48:35.660 --> 1:48:39.820\n And I went on a rabbit hole often do of Wikipedia.\n\n1:48:39.820 --> 1:48:42.580\n And I found a page on\n\n1:48:43.860 --> 1:48:48.860\n finiteism, ultra finiteism and intuitionism\n\n1:48:49.100 --> 1:48:51.180\n or into, I forget what it's called.\n\n1:48:51.180 --> 1:48:52.140\n Yeah, intuitionism.\n\n1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:53.740\n Intuitionism.\n\n1:48:53.740 --> 1:48:55.580\n That seemed pretty, pretty interesting.\n\n1:48:55.580 --> 1:48:58.420\n I have it on my to do list actually like look into\n\n1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:00.820\n like, is there people who like formally attract,\n\n1:49:00.820 --> 1:49:03.600\n like real mathematicians are trying to argue for this.\n\n1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:07.500\n But the belief there, I think, let's say finiteism\n\n1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:10.140\n that infinity is fake.\n\n1:49:11.860 --> 1:49:16.740\n Meaning, infinity might be like a useful hack\n\n1:49:16.740 --> 1:49:18.860\n for certain, like a useful tool in mathematics,\n\n1:49:18.860 --> 1:49:22.460\n but it really gets us into trouble\n\n1:49:22.460 --> 1:49:26.660\n because there's no infinity in the real world.\n\n1:49:26.660 --> 1:49:30.980\n Maybe I'm sort of not expressing that fully correctly,\n\n1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:32.780\n but basically saying like there's things\n\n1:49:32.780 --> 1:49:37.020\n that once you add into mathematics,\n\n1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:41.020\n things that are not provably within the physical world,\n\n1:49:41.020 --> 1:49:45.800\n you're starting to inject to corrupt your framework\n\n1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:46.640\n of reason.\n\n1:49:47.620 --> 1:49:49.180\n What do you think about that?\n\n1:49:49.180 --> 1:49:51.660\n I mean, I think, okay, so first of all, I'm not an expert\n\n1:49:51.660 --> 1:49:54.780\n and I couldn't even tell you what the difference is\n\n1:49:54.780 --> 1:49:58.340\n between those three terms, finiteism, ultra finiteism\n\n1:49:58.340 --> 1:49:59.940\n and intuitionism, although I know they're related\n\n1:49:59.940 --> 1:50:01.620\n and I tend to associate them with the Netherlands\n\n1:50:01.620 --> 1:50:02.620\n in the 1930s.\n\n1:50:02.620 --> 1:50:04.860\n Okay, I'll tell you, can I just quickly comment\n\n1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:06.860\n because I read the Wikipedia page.\n\n1:50:06.860 --> 1:50:07.700\n The difference in ultra.\n\n1:50:07.700 --> 1:50:10.480\n That's like the ultimate sentence of the modern age.\n\n1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:12.620\n Can I just comment because I read the Wikipedia page.\n\n1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:14.660\n That sums up our moment.\n\n1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:16.480\n Bro, I'm basically an expert.\n\n1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:19.700\n Ultra finiteism.\n\n1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:22.860\n So, finiteism says that the only infinity\n\n1:50:22.860 --> 1:50:25.220\n you're allowed to have is that the natural numbers\n\n1:50:25.220 --> 1:50:26.140\n are infinite.\n\n1:50:27.020 --> 1:50:29.240\n So, like those numbers are infinite.\n\n1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:32.200\n So, like one, two, three, four, five,\n\n1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:34.260\n the integers are infinite.\n\n1:50:35.460 --> 1:50:39.560\n The ultra finiteism says, nope, even that infinity is fake.\n\n1:50:41.480 --> 1:50:43.120\n I'll bet ultra finiteism came second.\n\n1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:44.740\n I'll bet it's like when there's like a hardcore scene\n\n1:50:44.740 --> 1:50:47.180\n and then one guy's like, oh, now there's a lot of people\n\n1:50:47.180 --> 1:50:48.020\n in the scene.\n\n1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:49.180\n I have to find a way to be more hardcore\n\n1:50:49.180 --> 1:50:50.180\n than the hardcore people.\n\n1:50:50.180 --> 1:50:52.460\n It's all back to the emo, Doc.\n\n1:50:52.460 --> 1:50:54.780\n Okay, so is there any, are you ever,\n\n1:50:54.780 --> 1:50:58.020\n because I'm often uncomfortable with infinity,\n\n1:50:58.020 --> 1:50:59.700\n like psychologically.\n\n1:50:59.700 --> 1:51:04.620\n I have trouble when that sneaks in there.\n\n1:51:04.620 --> 1:51:06.660\n It's because it works so damn well,\n\n1:51:06.660 --> 1:51:09.340\n I get a little suspicious,\n\n1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:12.580\n because it could be almost like a crutch\n\n1:51:12.580 --> 1:51:15.540\n or an oversimplification that's missing something profound\n\n1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:16.460\n about reality.\n\n1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:20.720\n Well, so first of all, okay, if you say like,\n\n1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:24.900\n is there like a serious way of doing mathematics\n\n1:51:24.900 --> 1:51:29.300\n that doesn't really treat infinity as a real thing\n\n1:51:29.300 --> 1:51:30.600\n or maybe it's kind of agnostic\n\n1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:32.660\n and it's like, I'm not really gonna make a firm statement\n\n1:51:32.660 --> 1:51:33.980\n about whether it's a real thing or not.\n\n1:51:33.980 --> 1:51:36.620\n Yeah, that's called most of the history of mathematics.\n\n1:51:36.620 --> 1:51:41.520\n So it's only after Cantor that we really are sort of,\n\n1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:43.920\n okay, we're gonna like have a notion\n\n1:51:43.920 --> 1:51:45.660\n of like the cardinality of an infinite set\n\n1:51:45.660 --> 1:51:49.100\n and like do something that you might call\n\n1:51:49.100 --> 1:51:51.340\n like the modern theory of infinity.\n\n1:51:51.340 --> 1:51:54.100\n That said, obviously everybody was drawn to this notion\n\n1:51:54.100 --> 1:51:55.800\n and no, not everybody was comfortable with it.\n\n1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:57.700\n Look, I mean, this is what happens with Newton.\n\n1:51:57.700 --> 1:52:01.380\n I mean, so Newton understands that to talk about tangents\n\n1:52:01.380 --> 1:52:03.480\n and to talk about instantaneous velocity,\n\n1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:06.620\n he has to do something that we would now call\n\n1:52:06.620 --> 1:52:08.700\n taking a limit, right?\n\n1:52:08.700 --> 1:52:11.260\n The fabled dy over dx, if you sort of go back\n\n1:52:11.260 --> 1:52:13.100\n to your calculus class, for those who have taken calculus\n\n1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:14.860\n and remember this mysterious thing.\n\n1:52:14.860 --> 1:52:17.360\n And you know, what is it?\n\n1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:18.200\n What is it?\n\n1:52:18.200 --> 1:52:19.740\n Well, he'd say like, well, it's like,\n\n1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:24.060\n you sort of divide the length of this line segment\n\n1:52:24.060 --> 1:52:25.300\n by the length of this other line segment.\n\n1:52:25.300 --> 1:52:26.340\n And then you make them a little shorter\n\n1:52:26.340 --> 1:52:27.180\n and you divide again.\n\n1:52:27.180 --> 1:52:28.100\n And then you make them a little shorter\n\n1:52:28.100 --> 1:52:28.940\n and you divide again.\n\n1:52:28.940 --> 1:52:29.780\n And then you just keep on doing that\n\n1:52:29.780 --> 1:52:30.780\n until they're like infinitely short\n\n1:52:30.780 --> 1:52:32.520\n and then you divide them again.\n\n1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:36.360\n These quantities that are like, they're not zero,\n\n1:52:36.360 --> 1:52:41.360\n but they're also smaller than any actual number,\n\n1:52:42.020 --> 1:52:43.420\n these infinitesimals.\n\n1:52:43.420 --> 1:52:46.380\n Well, people were queasy about it\n\n1:52:46.380 --> 1:52:48.180\n and they weren't wrong to be queasy about it, right?\n\n1:52:48.180 --> 1:52:50.100\n From a modern perspective, it was not really well formed.\n\n1:52:50.100 --> 1:52:52.300\n There's this very famous critique of Newton\n\n1:52:52.300 --> 1:52:54.500\n by Bishop Berkeley, where he says like,\n\n1:52:54.500 --> 1:52:57.820\n what these things you define, like, you know,\n\n1:52:57.820 --> 1:53:00.260\n they're not zero, but they're smaller than any number.\n\n1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:02.420\n Are they the ghosts of departed quantities?\n\n1:53:02.420 --> 1:53:06.860\n That was this like ultra burn of Newton.\n\n1:53:06.860 --> 1:53:10.040\n And on the one hand, he was right.\n\n1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:11.740\n It wasn't really rigorous by modern standards.\n\n1:53:11.740 --> 1:53:14.380\n On the other hand, like Newton was out there doing calculus\n\n1:53:14.380 --> 1:53:15.380\n and other people were not, right?\n\n1:53:15.380 --> 1:53:17.380\n It works, it works.\n\n1:53:17.380 --> 1:53:20.660\n I think a sort of intuitionist view, for instance,\n\n1:53:20.660 --> 1:53:23.620\n I would say would express serious doubt.\n\n1:53:23.620 --> 1:53:25.940\n And by the way, it's not just infinity.\n\n1:53:25.940 --> 1:53:28.100\n It's like saying, I think we would express serious doubt\n\n1:53:28.100 --> 1:53:30.340\n that like the real numbers exist.\n\n1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:36.320\n Now, most people are comfortable with the real numbers.\n\n1:53:36.820 --> 1:53:39.220\n Well, computer scientists with floating point number,\n\n1:53:39.220 --> 1:53:42.740\n I mean, floating point arithmetic.\n\n1:53:42.740 --> 1:53:44.720\n That's a great point, actually.\n\n1:53:44.720 --> 1:53:48.420\n I think in some sense, this flavor of doing math,\n\n1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:51.220\n saying we shouldn't talk about things\n\n1:53:51.220 --> 1:53:53.620\n that we cannot specify in a finite amount of time,\n\n1:53:53.620 --> 1:53:55.980\n there's something very computational in flavor about that.\n\n1:53:55.980 --> 1:53:57.580\n And it's probably not a coincidence\n\n1:53:57.580 --> 1:54:01.740\n that it becomes popular in the 30s and 40s,\n\n1:54:01.740 --> 1:54:04.980\n which is also like kind of like the dawn of ideas\n\n1:54:04.980 --> 1:54:06.180\n about formal computation, right?\n\n1:54:06.180 --> 1:54:07.940\n You probably know the timeline better than I do.\n\n1:54:07.940 --> 1:54:09.620\n Sorry, what becomes popular?\n\n1:54:09.620 --> 1:54:12.200\n These ideas that maybe we should be doing math\n\n1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:16.140\n in this more restrictive way where even a thing that,\n\n1:54:16.140 --> 1:54:18.540\n because look, the origin of all this is like,\n\n1:54:18.540 --> 1:54:22.580\n number represents a magnitude, like the length of a line.\n\n1:54:22.580 --> 1:54:26.060\n So I mean, the idea that there's a continuum,\n\n1:54:26.060 --> 1:54:30.580\n there's sort of like, it's pretty old,\n\n1:54:30.580 --> 1:54:31.900\n but just because something is old\n\n1:54:31.900 --> 1:54:34.220\n doesn't mean we can't reject it if we want to.\n\n1:54:34.220 --> 1:54:36.580\n Well, a lot of the fundamental ideas in computer science,\n\n1:54:36.580 --> 1:54:40.060\n when you talk about the complexity of problems,\n\n1:54:41.380 --> 1:54:45.060\n to Turing himself, they rely on an infinity as well.\n\n1:54:45.060 --> 1:54:47.540\n The ideas that kind of challenge that,\n\n1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:48.780\n the whole space of machine learning,\n\n1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:51.000\n I would say, challenges that.\n\n1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.020\n It's almost like the engineering approach to things,\n\n1:54:53.020 --> 1:54:54.660\n like the floating point arithmetic.\n\n1:54:54.660 --> 1:54:57.340\n The other one that, back to John Conway,\n\n1:54:57.340 --> 1:55:00.780\n that challenges this idea,\n\n1:55:00.780 --> 1:55:04.180\n I mean, maybe to tie in the ideas of deformation theory\n\n1:55:06.540 --> 1:55:11.540\n and limits to infinity is this idea of cellular automata\n\n1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:17.340\n with John Conway looking at the game of life,\n\n1:55:17.340 --> 1:55:19.340\n Stephen Wolfram's work,\n\n1:55:19.340 --> 1:55:22.580\n that I've been a big fan of for a while, cellular automata.\n\n1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:23.780\n I was wondering if you have,\n\n1:55:23.780 --> 1:55:26.900\n if you have ever encountered these kinds of objects,\n\n1:55:26.900 --> 1:55:29.320\n you ever looked at them as a mathematician,\n\n1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:34.320\n where you have very simple rules of tiny little objects\n\n1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:37.980\n that when taken as a whole create incredible complexities,\n\n1:55:37.980 --> 1:55:39.820\n but are very difficult to analyze,\n\n1:55:39.820 --> 1:55:41.980\n very difficult to make sense of,\n\n1:55:41.980 --> 1:55:45.120\n even though the one individual object, one part,\n\n1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:47.540\n it's like what we were saying about Andrew Wiles,\n\n1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:49.780\n you can look at the deformation of a small piece\n\n1:55:49.780 --> 1:55:51.340\n to tell you about the whole.\n\n1:55:51.340 --> 1:55:54.460\n It feels like with cellular automata\n\n1:55:54.460 --> 1:55:56.400\n or any kind of complex systems,\n\n1:55:57.340 --> 1:55:59.820\n it's often very difficult to say something\n\n1:55:59.820 --> 1:56:01.620\n about the whole thing,\n\n1:56:01.620 --> 1:56:05.100\n even when you can precisely describe the operation\n\n1:56:05.100 --> 1:56:09.380\n of the local neighborhoods.\n\n1:56:09.380 --> 1:56:10.980\n Yeah, I mean, I love that subject.\n\n1:56:10.980 --> 1:56:12.660\n I haven't really done research on it myself.\n\n1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:13.540\n I've played around with it.\n\n1:56:13.540 --> 1:56:15.060\n I'll send you a fun blog post I wrote\n\n1:56:15.060 --> 1:56:17.340\n where I made some cool texture patterns\n\n1:56:17.340 --> 1:56:20.000\n from cellular automata that I, but.\n\n1:56:20.980 --> 1:56:22.460\n And those are really always compelling\n\n1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:24.140\n is like you create simple rules\n\n1:56:24.140 --> 1:56:25.820\n and they create some beautiful textures.\n\n1:56:25.820 --> 1:56:26.660\n It doesn't make any sense.\n\n1:56:26.660 --> 1:56:28.020\n Actually, did you see, there was a great paper.\n\n1:56:28.020 --> 1:56:28.980\n I don't know if you saw this,\n\n1:56:28.980 --> 1:56:30.640\n like a machine learning paper.\n\n1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:31.480\n Yes.\n\n1:56:31.480 --> 1:56:32.300\n I don't know if you saw the one I'm talking about\n\n1:56:32.300 --> 1:56:33.300\n where they were like learning the texture\n\n1:56:33.300 --> 1:56:35.660\n as like let's try to like reverse engineer\n\n1:56:35.660 --> 1:56:37.220\n and like learn a cellular automaton\n\n1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:39.340\n that can reduce texture that looks like this\n\n1:56:39.340 --> 1:56:40.340\n from the images.\n\n1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:41.300\n Very cool.\n\n1:56:41.300 --> 1:56:44.760\n And as you say, the thing you said is I feel the same way\n\n1:56:44.760 --> 1:56:45.980\n when I read machine learning paper\n\n1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:47.660\n is that what's especially interesting\n\n1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:49.540\n is the cases where it doesn't work.\n\n1:56:49.540 --> 1:56:51.260\n Like what does it do when it doesn't do the thing\n\n1:56:51.260 --> 1:56:53.380\n that you tried to train it to do?\n\n1:56:53.380 --> 1:56:54.480\n That's extremely interesting.\n\n1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:56.100\n Yeah, yeah, that was a cool paper.\n\n1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:58.340\n So yeah, so let's start with the game of life.\n\n1:56:58.340 --> 1:57:02.300\n Let's start with, or let's start with John Conway.\n\n1:57:02.300 --> 1:57:03.620\n So Conway.\n\n1:57:03.620 --> 1:57:06.060\n So yeah, so let's start with John Conway again.\n\n1:57:06.060 --> 1:57:08.620\n Just, I don't know, from my outsider's perspective,\n\n1:57:08.620 --> 1:57:11.500\n there's not many mathematicians that stand out\n\n1:57:11.500 --> 1:57:13.800\n throughout the history of the 20th century.\n\n1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:15.100\n And he's one of them.\n\n1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:18.180\n I feel like he's not sufficiently recognized.\n\n1:57:18.180 --> 1:57:20.120\n I think he's pretty recognized.\n\n1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:21.120\n Okay, well.\n\n1:57:21.120 --> 1:57:24.360\n I mean, he was a full professor at Princeton\n\n1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:25.200\n for most of his life.\n\n1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:27.100\n He was sort of certainly at the pinnacle of.\n\n1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:30.180\n Yeah, but I found myself every time I talk about Conway\n\n1:57:30.180 --> 1:57:32.240\n and how excited I am about him,\n\n1:57:33.140 --> 1:57:36.660\n I have to constantly explain to people who he is.\n\n1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:39.540\n And that's always a sad sign to me.\n\n1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:41.540\n But that's probably true for a lot of mathematicians.\n\n1:57:41.540 --> 1:57:42.380\n I was about to say,\n\n1:57:42.380 --> 1:57:44.940\n I feel like you have a very elevated idea of how famous.\n\n1:57:44.940 --> 1:57:46.740\n This is what happens when you grow up in the Soviet Union\n\n1:57:46.740 --> 1:57:49.860\n or you think the mathematicians are like very, very famous.\n\n1:57:49.860 --> 1:57:53.100\n Yeah, but I'm not actually so convinced at a tiny tangent\n\n1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:54.660\n that that shouldn't be so.\n\n1:57:54.660 --> 1:57:57.640\n I mean, there's, it's not obvious to me\n\n1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:59.160\n that that's one of the,\n\n1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:01.540\n like if I were to analyze American society,\n\n1:58:01.540 --> 1:58:05.060\n that perhaps elevating mathematical and scientific thinking\n\n1:58:05.060 --> 1:58:08.740\n to a little bit higher level would benefit the society.\n\n1:58:08.740 --> 1:58:11.300\n Well, both in discovering the beauty of what it is\n\n1:58:11.300 --> 1:58:15.020\n to be human and for actually creating cool technology,\n\n1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:16.240\n better iPhones.\n\n1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:18.140\n But anyway, John Conway.\n\n1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:20.000\n Yeah, and Conway is such a perfect example\n\n1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.060\n of somebody whose humanity was,\n\n1:58:22.060 --> 1:58:24.020\n and his personality was like wound up\n\n1:58:24.020 --> 1:58:25.020\n with his mathematics, right?\n\n1:58:25.020 --> 1:58:26.780\n And so it's not, sometimes I think people\n\n1:58:26.780 --> 1:58:28.620\n who are outside the field think of mathematics\n\n1:58:28.620 --> 1:58:31.220\n as this kind of like cold thing that you do\n\n1:58:31.220 --> 1:58:33.100\n separate from your existence as a human being.\n\n1:58:33.100 --> 1:58:34.780\n No way, your personality is in there,\n\n1:58:34.780 --> 1:58:37.140\n just as it would be in like a novel you wrote\n\n1:58:37.140 --> 1:58:38.220\n or a painting you painted\n\n1:58:38.220 --> 1:58:40.100\n or just like the way you walk down the street.\n\n1:58:40.100 --> 1:58:41.780\n Like it's in there, it's you doing it.\n\n1:58:41.780 --> 1:58:44.580\n And Conway was certainly a singular personality.\n\n1:58:46.240 --> 1:58:50.980\n I think anybody would say that he was playful,\n\n1:58:50.980 --> 1:58:54.240\n like everything was a game to him.\n\n1:58:54.240 --> 1:58:56.580\n Now, what you might think I'm gonna say,\n\n1:58:56.580 --> 1:58:59.260\n and it's true is that he sort of was very playful\n\n1:58:59.260 --> 1:59:01.780\n in his way of doing mathematics,\n\n1:59:01.780 --> 1:59:03.700\n but it's also true, it went both ways.\n\n1:59:03.700 --> 1:59:06.220\n He also sort of made mathematics out of games.\n\n1:59:06.220 --> 1:59:08.880\n He like looked at, he was a constant inventor of games\n\n1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:10.080\n or like crazy names.\n\n1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:14.060\n And then he would sort of analyze those games mathematically\n\n1:59:15.220 --> 1:59:16.300\n to the point that he,\n\n1:59:16.300 --> 1:59:19.120\n and then later collaborating with Knuth like,\n\n1:59:19.120 --> 1:59:22.420\n created this number system, the serial numbers\n\n1:59:22.420 --> 1:59:25.200\n in which actually each number is a game.\n\n1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:26.640\n There's a wonderful book about this called,\n\n1:59:26.640 --> 1:59:27.620\n I mean, there are his own books.\n\n1:59:27.620 --> 1:59:28.780\n And then there's like a book that he wrote\n\n1:59:28.780 --> 1:59:31.180\n with Berlekamp and Guy called Winning Ways,\n\n1:59:31.180 --> 1:59:35.260\n which is such a rich source of ideas.\n\n1:59:35.260 --> 1:59:40.260\n And he too kind of has his own crazy number system\n\n1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:44.240\n in which by the way, there are these infinitesimals,\n\n1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:45.640\n the ghosts of departed quantities.\n\n1:59:45.640 --> 1:59:47.900\n They're in there now, not as ghosts,\n\n1:59:47.900 --> 1:59:50.200\n but as like certain kind of two player games.\n\n1:59:53.620 --> 1:59:58.620\n So, he was a guy, so I knew him when I was a postdoc\n\n2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:01.280\n and I knew him at Princeton\n\n2:00:01.280 --> 2:00:03.620\n and our research overlapped in some ways.\n\n2:00:03.620 --> 2:00:05.880\n Now it was on stuff that he had worked on many years before.\n\n2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:07.400\n The stuff I was working on kind of connected\n\n2:00:07.400 --> 2:00:08.280\n with stuff in group theory,\n\n2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:10.420\n which somehow seems to keep coming up.\n\n2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:16.040\n And so I often would like sort of ask him a question.\n\n2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:17.680\n I would sort of come upon him in the common room\n\n2:00:17.680 --> 2:00:19.080\n and I would ask him a question about something.\n\n2:00:19.080 --> 2:00:23.780\n And just anytime you turned him on, you know what I mean?\n\n2:00:23.780 --> 2:00:25.240\n You sort of asked the question,\n\n2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:28.280\n it was just like turning a knob and winding him up\n\n2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:31.040\n and he would just go and you would get a response\n\n2:00:31.040 --> 2:00:35.240\n that was like so rich and went so many places\n\n2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:37.360\n and taught you so much.\n\n2:00:37.360 --> 2:00:40.160\n And usually had nothing to do with your question.\n\n2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:43.080\n Usually your question was just a prompt to him.\n\n2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:44.760\n You couldn't count on actually getting the question answered.\n\n2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:47.400\n Yeah, those brilliant, curious minds even at that age.\n\n2:00:47.400 --> 2:00:50.340\n Yeah, it was definitely a huge loss.\n\n2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:54.680\n But on his game of life,\n\n2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:56.960\n which was I think he developed in the 70s\n\n2:00:56.960 --> 2:00:59.720\n as almost like a side thing, a fun little experiment.\n\n2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:04.720\n His game of life is this, it's a very simple algorithm.\n\n2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:07.800\n It's not really a game per se\n\n2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:09.520\n in the sense of the kinds of games that he liked\n\n2:01:09.520 --> 2:01:11.560\n where people played against each other.\n\n2:01:12.780 --> 2:01:16.560\n But essentially it's a game that you play\n\n2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:20.400\n with marking little squares on the sheet of graph paper.\n\n2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:22.360\n And in the 70s, I think he was like literally doing it\n\n2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:24.240\n with like a pen on graph paper.\n\n2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:26.040\n You have some configuration of squares.\n\n2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:28.280\n Some of the squares in the graph paper are filled in,\n\n2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:29.120\n some are not.\n\n2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:32.360\n And there's a rule, a single rule that tells you\n\n2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:36.480\n at the next stage, which squares are filled in\n\n2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:38.120\n and which squares are not.\n\n2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:39.720\n Sometimes an empty square gets filled in,\n\n2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:40.560\n that's called birth.\n\n2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:43.000\n Sometimes a square that's filled in gets erased,\n\n2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:43.960\n that's called death.\n\n2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:45.880\n And there's rules for which squares are born\n\n2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:47.100\n and which squares die.\n\n2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:51.920\n The rule is very simple.\n\n2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:53.640\n You can write it on one line.\n\n2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:56.240\n And then the great miracle is that you can start\n\n2:01:56.240 --> 2:02:00.320\n from some very innocent looking little small set of boxes\n\n2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:04.160\n and get these results of incredible richness.\n\n2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:05.680\n And of course, nowadays you don't do it on paper.\n\n2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:07.000\n Nowadays you do it in a computer.\n\n2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.320\n There's actually a great iPad app called Golly,\n\n2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:12.800\n which I really like that has like Conway's original rule\n\n2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:15.600\n and like, gosh, like hundreds of other variants\n\n2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:16.820\n and it's a lightning fast.\n\n2:02:16.820 --> 2:02:17.660\n So you can just be like,\n\n2:02:17.660 --> 2:02:21.400\n I wanna see 10,000 generations of this rule play out\n\n2:02:21.400 --> 2:02:23.000\n like faster than your eye can even follow.\n\n2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:24.040\n And it's like amazing.\n\n2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:26.360\n So I highly recommend it if this is at all intriguing to you\n\n2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:29.400\n getting Golly on your iOS device.\n\n2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:30.740\n And you can do this kind of process,\n\n2:02:30.740 --> 2:02:32.080\n which I really enjoy doing,\n\n2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:35.080\n which is almost from like putting a Darwin hat on\n\n2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:38.600\n or a biologist hat on and doing analysis\n\n2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:41.500\n of a higher level of abstraction,\n\n2:02:41.500 --> 2:02:43.520\n like the organisms that spring up.\n\n2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:45.160\n Cause there's different kinds of organisms.\n\n2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:46.880\n Like you can think of them as species\n\n2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:48.640\n and they interact with each other.\n\n2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:51.040\n They can, there's gliders, they shoot different,\n\n2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:54.320\n there's like things that can travel around.\n\n2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:55.920\n There's things that can,\n\n2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:58.520\n glider guns that can generate those gliders.\n\n2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:01.800\n You can use the same kind of language\n\n2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:04.600\n as you would about describing a biological system.\n\n2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:06.240\n So it's a wonderful laboratory\n\n2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:07.920\n and it's kind of a rebuke to someone\n\n2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:10.960\n who doesn't think that like very, very rich,\n\n2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:15.960\n complex structure can come from very simple underlying laws.\n\n2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:18.880\n Like it definitely can.\n\n2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:20.600\n Now, here's what's interesting.\n\n2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:23.640\n If you just pick like some random rule,\n\n2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:26.200\n you wouldn't get interesting complexity.\n\n2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:28.360\n I think that's one of the most interesting things\n\n2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:31.440\n of these, one of these most interesting features\n\n2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:32.280\n of this whole subject,\n\n2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:34.100\n that the rules have to be tuned just right.\n\n2:03:34.100 --> 2:03:36.060\n Like a sort of typical rule set\n\n2:03:36.060 --> 2:03:38.760\n doesn't generate any kind of interesting behavior.\n\n2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:40.660\n But some do.\n\n2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:44.560\n And I don't think we have a clear way of understanding\n\n2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:45.400\n which do and which don't.\n\n2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:47.320\n Maybe Steven thinks he does, I don't know.\n\n2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:51.820\n No, no, it's a giant mystery where Steven Wolfram did is,\n\n2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:56.000\n now there's a whole interesting aspect to the fact\n\n2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:57.640\n that he's a little bit of an outcast\n\n2:03:57.640 --> 2:03:59.920\n in the mathematics and physics community\n\n2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:02.640\n because he's so focused on a particular,\n\n2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:03.960\n his particular work.\n\n2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:05.800\n I think if you put ego aside,\n\n2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:08.640\n which I think unfairly some people\n\n2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:09.940\n are not able to look beyond,\n\n2:04:09.940 --> 2:04:11.880\n I think his work is actually quite brilliant.\n\n2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:13.840\n But what he did is exactly this process\n\n2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:15.920\n of Darwin like exploration.\n\n2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:17.400\n He's taking these very simple ideas\n\n2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:19.880\n and writing a thousand page book on them,\n\n2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:22.280\n meaning like, let's play around with this thing.\n\n2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:23.480\n Let's see.\n\n2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:25.480\n And can we figure anything out?\n\n2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:27.320\n Spoiler alert, no, we can't.\n\n2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:31.040\n In fact, he does a challenge.\n\n2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:33.240\n I think it's like rule 30 challenge,\n\n2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:34.160\n which is quite interesting,\n\n2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:36.400\n just simply for machine learning people,\n\n2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:39.420\n for mathematics people,\n\n2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:41.800\n is can you predict the middle column?\n\n2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:45.980\n For his, it's a 1D cellular automata.\n\n2:04:45.980 --> 2:04:48.240\n Can you, generally speaking,\n\n2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:50.280\n can you predict anything about\n\n2:04:50.280 --> 2:04:54.380\n how a particular rule will evolve just in the future?\n\n2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:56.320\n Very simple.\n\n2:04:56.320 --> 2:04:59.040\n Just looking at one particular part of the world,\n\n2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:00.560\n just zooming in on that part,\n\n2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:04.720\n 100 steps ahead, can you predict something?\n\n2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:08.800\n And the challenge is to do that kind of prediction\n\n2:05:08.800 --> 2:05:10.340\n so far as nobody's come up with an answer.\n\n2:05:10.340 --> 2:05:13.520\n But the point is like, we can't.\n\n2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:16.880\n We don't have tools or maybe it's impossible or,\n\n2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:19.960\n I mean, he has these kind of laws of irreducibility\n\n2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:21.520\n that he refers to, but it's poetry.\n\n2:05:21.520 --> 2:05:22.880\n It's like, we can't prove these things.\n\n2:05:22.880 --> 2:05:24.420\n It seems like we can't.\n\n2:05:24.420 --> 2:05:25.260\n That's the basic.\n\n2:05:26.280 --> 2:05:28.520\n It almost sounds like ancient mathematics\n\n2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:30.060\n or something like that, where you're like,\n\n2:05:30.060 --> 2:05:34.320\n the gods will not allow us to predict the cellular automata.\n\n2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:37.840\n But that's fascinating that we can't.\n\n2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:39.120\n I'm not sure what to make of it.\n\n2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:43.000\n And there's power to calling this particular set of rules\n\n2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:47.880\n game of life as Conway did, because not exactly sure,\n\n2:05:47.880 --> 2:05:51.480\n but I think he had a sense that there's some core ideas here\n\n2:05:51.480 --> 2:05:55.800\n that are fundamental to life, to complex systems,\n\n2:05:55.800 --> 2:05:57.520\n to the way life emerge on earth.\n\n2:05:59.320 --> 2:06:01.720\n I'm not sure I think Conway thought that.\n\n2:06:01.720 --> 2:06:03.200\n It's something that, I mean, Conway always had\n\n2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:05.880\n a rather ambivalent relationship with the game of life\n\n2:06:05.880 --> 2:06:09.960\n because I think he saw it as,\n\n2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:12.960\n it was certainly the thing he was most famous for\n\n2:06:12.960 --> 2:06:14.680\n in the outside world.\n\n2:06:14.680 --> 2:06:18.640\n And I think that he, his view, which is correct,\n\n2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:19.600\n is that he had done things\n\n2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:22.120\n that were much deeper mathematically than that.\n\n2:06:22.120 --> 2:06:24.260\n And I think it always aggrieved him a bit\n\n2:06:24.260 --> 2:06:26.200\n that he was the game of life guy\n\n2:06:26.200 --> 2:06:28.640\n when he proved all these wonderful theorems\n\n2:06:28.640 --> 2:06:32.080\n and created all these wonderful games,\n\n2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:33.360\n created the serial numbers.\n\n2:06:33.360 --> 2:06:36.520\n I mean, he was a very tireless guy\n\n2:06:36.520 --> 2:06:40.800\n who just did an incredibly variegated array of stuff.\n\n2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:42.480\n So he was exactly the kind of person\n\n2:06:42.480 --> 2:06:45.600\n who you would never want to reduce to one achievement.\n\n2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:46.920\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:06:46.920 --> 2:06:50.400\n Let me ask you about group theory.\n\n2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:51.800\n You mentioned it a few times.\n\n2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:53.440\n What is group theory?\n\n2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:57.420\n What is an idea from group theory that you find beautiful?\n\n2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:01.960\n Well, so I would say group theory sort of starts\n\n2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:04.660\n as the general theory of symmetries,\n\n2:07:04.660 --> 2:07:08.280\n that people looked at different kinds of things\n\n2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:12.960\n and said, as we said, oh, it could have,\n\n2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:16.440\n maybe all there is is symmetry from left to right,\n\n2:07:16.440 --> 2:07:17.760\n like a human being, right?\n\n2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:21.320\n That's roughly bilaterally symmetric, as we say.\n\n2:07:21.320 --> 2:07:23.840\n So there's two symmetries.\n\n2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:24.920\n And then you're like, well, wait, didn't I say\n\n2:07:24.920 --> 2:07:26.720\n there's just one, there's just left to right?\n\n2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:30.080\n Well, we always count the symmetry of doing nothing.\n\n2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:31.100\n We always count the symmetry\n\n2:07:31.100 --> 2:07:33.080\n that's like there's flip and don't flip.\n\n2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:35.200\n Those are the two configurations that you can be in.\n\n2:07:35.200 --> 2:07:36.040\n So there's two.\n\n2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:40.240\n You know, something like a rectangle\n\n2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:41.560\n is bilaterally symmetric.\n\n2:07:41.560 --> 2:07:42.600\n You can flip it left to right,\n\n2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:44.560\n but you can also flip it top to bottom.\n\n2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:47.680\n So there's actually four symmetries.\n\n2:07:47.680 --> 2:07:50.320\n There's do nothing, flip it left to right\n\n2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:52.960\n and flip it top to bottom or do both of those things.\n\n2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:57.960\n And then a square, there's even more,\n\n2:07:59.700 --> 2:08:01.700\n because now you can rotate it.\n\n2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:03.060\n You can rotate it by 90 degrees.\n\n2:08:03.060 --> 2:08:03.900\n So you can't do that.\n\n2:08:03.900 --> 2:08:04.940\n That's not a symmetry of the rectangle.\n\n2:08:04.940 --> 2:08:06.180\n If you try to rotate it 90 degrees,\n\n2:08:06.180 --> 2:08:08.880\n you get a rectangle oriented in a different way.\n\n2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:11.880\n So a person has two symmetries,\n\n2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:14.420\n a rectangle four, a square eight,\n\n2:08:14.420 --> 2:08:15.420\n different kinds of shapes\n\n2:08:15.420 --> 2:08:17.520\n have different numbers of symmetries.\n\n2:08:18.860 --> 2:08:19.940\n And the real observation is that\n\n2:08:19.940 --> 2:08:24.940\n that's just not like a set of things, they can be combined.\n\n2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:27.700\n You do one symmetry, then you do another.\n\n2:08:27.700 --> 2:08:31.020\n The result of that is some third symmetry.\n\n2:08:31.020 --> 2:08:34.840\n So a group really abstracts away this notion of saying,\n\n2:08:38.780 --> 2:08:41.180\n it's just some collection of transformations\n\n2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:42.060\n you can do to a thing\n\n2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:44.380\n where you combine any two of them to get a third.\n\n2:08:44.380 --> 2:08:45.620\n So, you know, a place where this comes up\n\n2:08:45.620 --> 2:08:48.260\n in computer science is in sorting,\n\n2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:50.500\n because the ways of permuting a set,\n\n2:08:50.500 --> 2:08:52.340\n the ways of taking sort of some set of things\n\n2:08:52.340 --> 2:08:53.180\n you have on the table\n\n2:08:53.180 --> 2:08:54.260\n and putting them in a different order,\n\n2:08:54.260 --> 2:08:56.100\n shuffling a deck of cards, for instance,\n\n2:08:56.100 --> 2:08:57.580\n those are the symmetries of the deck.\n\n2:08:57.580 --> 2:08:58.420\n And there's a lot of them.\n\n2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:00.140\n There's not two, there's not four, there's not eight.\n\n2:09:00.140 --> 2:09:01.560\n Think about how many different orders\n\n2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:02.620\n the deck of card can be in.\n\n2:09:02.620 --> 2:09:05.980\n Each one of those is the result of applying a symmetry\n\n2:09:06.820 --> 2:09:07.660\n to the original deck.\n\n2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:09.060\n So a shuffle is a symmetry, right?\n\n2:09:09.060 --> 2:09:10.620\n You're reordering the cards.\n\n2:09:10.620 --> 2:09:12.940\n If I shuffle and then you shuffle,\n\n2:09:12.940 --> 2:09:16.020\n the result is some other kind of thing.\n\n2:09:16.020 --> 2:09:17.780\n You might call it a double shuffle,\n\n2:09:17.780 --> 2:09:19.980\n which is a more complicated symmetry.\n\n2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:22.180\n So group theory is kind of the study\n\n2:09:22.180 --> 2:09:24.460\n of the general abstract world\n\n2:09:24.460 --> 2:09:27.020\n that encompasses all these kinds of things.\n\n2:09:27.020 --> 2:09:29.380\n But then of course, like lots of things\n\n2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:31.780\n that are way more complicated than that.\n\n2:09:31.780 --> 2:09:33.540\n Like infinite groups of symmetries, for instance.\n\n2:09:33.540 --> 2:09:35.100\n So they can be infinite, huh?\n\n2:09:35.100 --> 2:09:35.940\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:36.780\n Okay.\n\n2:09:36.780 --> 2:09:37.620\n Well, okay, ready?\n\n2:09:37.620 --> 2:09:41.180\n Think about the symmetries of the line.\n\n2:09:41.180 --> 2:09:45.020\n You're like, okay, I can reflect it left to right,\n\n2:09:45.020 --> 2:09:46.820\n you know, around the origin.\n\n2:09:46.820 --> 2:09:49.580\n Okay, but I could also reflect it left to right,\n\n2:09:49.580 --> 2:09:52.180\n grabbing somewhere else, like at one or two\n\n2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:54.620\n or pi or anywhere.\n\n2:09:54.620 --> 2:09:56.440\n Or I could just slide it some distance.\n\n2:09:56.440 --> 2:09:57.340\n That's a symmetry.\n\n2:09:57.340 --> 2:09:58.540\n Slide it five units over.\n\n2:09:58.540 --> 2:10:01.220\n So there's clearly infinitely many symmetries of the line.\n\n2:10:01.220 --> 2:10:03.500\n That's an example of an infinite group of symmetries.\n\n2:10:03.500 --> 2:10:06.940\n Is it possible to say something that kind of captivates,\n\n2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:09.420\n keeps being brought up by physicists,\n\n2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:11.760\n which is gauge theory, gauge symmetry,\n\n2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:14.900\n as one of the more complicated type of symmetries?\n\n2:10:14.900 --> 2:10:18.380\n Is there an easy explanation of what the heck it is?\n\n2:10:18.380 --> 2:10:21.860\n Is that something that comes up on your mind at all?\n\n2:10:21.860 --> 2:10:23.380\n Well, I'm not a mathematical physicist,\n\n2:10:23.380 --> 2:10:24.380\n but I can say this.\n\n2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:29.380\n It is certainly true that it has been a very useful notion\n\n2:10:29.460 --> 2:10:31.860\n in physics to try to say like,\n\n2:10:31.860 --> 2:10:34.580\n what are the symmetry groups of the world?\n\n2:10:34.580 --> 2:10:35.660\n Like what are the symmetries\n\n2:10:35.660 --> 2:10:36.980\n under which things don't change, right?\n\n2:10:36.980 --> 2:10:39.220\n So we just, I think we talked a little bit earlier\n\n2:10:39.220 --> 2:10:40.700\n about it should be a basic principle\n\n2:10:40.700 --> 2:10:44.180\n that a theorem that's true here is also true over there.\n\n2:10:44.180 --> 2:10:45.700\n And same for a physical law, right?\n\n2:10:45.700 --> 2:10:47.660\n I mean, if gravity is like this over here,\n\n2:10:47.660 --> 2:10:49.140\n it should also be like this over there.\n\n2:10:49.140 --> 2:10:52.660\n Okay, what that's saying is we think translation in space\n\n2:10:52.660 --> 2:10:54.020\n should be a symmetry.\n\n2:10:54.020 --> 2:10:56.540\n All the laws of physics should be unchanged\n\n2:10:56.540 --> 2:10:57.860\n if the symmetry we have in mind\n\n2:10:57.860 --> 2:10:59.700\n is a very simple one like translation.\n\n2:10:59.700 --> 2:11:03.820\n And so then there becomes a question,\n\n2:11:03.820 --> 2:11:07.980\n like what are the symmetries of the actual world\n\n2:11:07.980 --> 2:11:09.820\n with its physical laws?\n\n2:11:09.820 --> 2:11:12.900\n And one way of thinking, this isn't oversimplification,\n\n2:11:12.900 --> 2:11:16.220\n but like one way of thinking of this big shift\n\n2:11:18.420 --> 2:11:22.420\n from before Einstein to after\n\n2:11:22.420 --> 2:11:25.300\n is that we just changed our idea\n\n2:11:25.300 --> 2:11:29.780\n about what the fundamental group of symmetries were.\n\n2:11:29.780 --> 2:11:31.820\n So that things like the Lorenz contraction,\n\n2:11:31.820 --> 2:11:34.340\n things like these bizarre relativistic phenomenon\n\n2:11:34.340 --> 2:11:37.700\n or Lorenz would have said, oh, to make this work,\n\n2:11:37.700 --> 2:11:42.700\n we need a thing to change its shape\n\n2:11:44.580 --> 2:11:47.460\n if it's moving nearly the speed of light.\n\n2:11:47.460 --> 2:11:50.260\n Well, under the new framework, it's much better.\n\n2:11:50.260 --> 2:11:51.700\n You say, oh, no, it wasn't changing its shape.\n\n2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:54.420\n You were just wrong about what counted as a symmetry.\n\n2:11:54.420 --> 2:11:55.420\n Now that we have this new group,\n\n2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:57.380\n the so called Lorenz group,\n\n2:11:57.380 --> 2:11:59.220\n now that we understand what the symmetries really are,\n\n2:11:59.220 --> 2:12:00.340\n we see it was just an illusion\n\n2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:02.940\n that the thing was changing its shape.\n\n2:12:02.940 --> 2:12:05.780\n Yeah, so you can then describe the sameness of things\n\n2:12:05.780 --> 2:12:08.820\n under this weirdness that is general relativity,\n\n2:12:08.820 --> 2:12:09.660\n for example.\n\n2:12:10.940 --> 2:12:15.940\n Yeah, yeah, still, I wish there was a simpler explanation\n\n2:12:16.020 --> 2:12:19.820\n of like exact, I mean, gauge symmetries,\n\n2:12:19.820 --> 2:12:24.340\n pretty simple general concept about rulers being deformed.\n\n2:12:26.260 --> 2:12:31.260\n I've actually just personally been on a search,\n\n2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:34.740\n not a very rigorous or aggressive search,\n\n2:12:34.740 --> 2:12:37.980\n but for something I personally enjoy,\n\n2:12:37.980 --> 2:12:40.980\n which is taking complicated concepts\n\n2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:44.780\n and finding the sort of minimal example\n\n2:12:44.780 --> 2:12:47.580\n that I can play around with, especially programmatically.\n\n2:12:47.580 --> 2:12:48.420\n That's great, I mean,\n\n2:12:48.420 --> 2:12:50.220\n this is what we try to train our students to do, right?\n\n2:12:50.220 --> 2:12:52.620\n I mean, in class, this is exactly what,\n\n2:12:52.620 --> 2:12:54.620\n this is like best pedagogical practice.\n\n2:12:54.620 --> 2:12:57.380\n I do hope there's simple explanation,\n\n2:12:57.380 --> 2:13:02.380\n especially like I've in my sort of drunk random walk,\n\n2:13:02.380 --> 2:13:04.580\n drunk walk, whatever that's called,\n\n2:13:04.580 --> 2:13:07.580\n sometimes stumble into the world of topology\n\n2:13:08.580 --> 2:13:11.420\n and like quickly, like, you know when you go into a party\n\n2:13:11.420 --> 2:13:14.260\n and you realize this is not the right party for me?\n\n2:13:14.260 --> 2:13:16.900\n It's, so whenever I go into topology,\n\n2:13:16.900 --> 2:13:20.420\n it's like so much math everywhere.\n\n2:13:20.420 --> 2:13:23.100\n I don't even know what, it feels like this is me\n\n2:13:23.100 --> 2:13:25.900\n like being a hater, I think there's way too much math.\n\n2:13:25.900 --> 2:13:29.220\n Like there are two, the cool kids who just want to have,\n\n2:13:29.220 --> 2:13:31.060\n like everything is expressed through math.\n\n2:13:31.060 --> 2:13:33.100\n Because they're actually afraid to express stuff\n\n2:13:33.100 --> 2:13:34.860\n simply through language.\n\n2:13:34.860 --> 2:13:37.580\n That's my hater formulation of topology.\n\n2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:39.620\n But at the same time, I'm sure that's very necessary\n\n2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:41.300\n to do sort of rigorous discussion.\n\n2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:42.620\n But I feel like.\n\n2:13:42.620 --> 2:13:44.300\n But don't you think that's what gauge symmetry is like?\n\n2:13:44.300 --> 2:13:45.420\n I mean, it's not a field I know well,\n\n2:13:45.420 --> 2:13:46.500\n but it certainly seems like.\n\n2:13:46.500 --> 2:13:47.820\n Yes, it is like that.\n\n2:13:47.820 --> 2:13:50.620\n But my problem with topology, okay,\n\n2:13:50.620 --> 2:13:55.140\n and even like differential geometry is like,\n\n2:13:55.140 --> 2:13:59.060\n you're talking about beautiful things.\n\n2:13:59.060 --> 2:14:02.060\n Like if they could be visualized, it's open question\n\n2:14:02.060 --> 2:14:03.900\n if everything could be visualized,\n\n2:14:03.900 --> 2:14:05.020\n but you're talking about things\n\n2:14:05.020 --> 2:14:08.100\n that can be visually stunning, I think.\n\n2:14:09.180 --> 2:14:12.620\n But they are hidden underneath all of that math.\n\n2:14:13.900 --> 2:14:16.380\n Like if you look at the papers that are written\n\n2:14:16.380 --> 2:14:18.580\n in topology, if you look at all the discussions\n\n2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:22.140\n on Stack Exchange, they're all math dense, math heavy.\n\n2:14:22.140 --> 2:14:25.420\n And the only kind of visual things\n\n2:14:25.420 --> 2:14:27.540\n that emerge every once in a while,\n\n2:14:27.540 --> 2:14:30.980\n is like something like a Mobius strip.\n\n2:14:30.980 --> 2:14:33.980\n Every once in a while, some kind of simple visualizations.\n\n2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:36.980\n Every once in a while, some kind of simple visualizations.\n\n2:14:36.980 --> 2:14:37.460\n Every once in a while, some kind of simple visualizations.\n\n2:14:37.460 --> 2:14:40.260\n Well, there's the vibration, there's the hop vibration\n\n2:14:40.260 --> 2:14:42.500\n or all those kinds of things that somebody,\n\n2:14:42.500 --> 2:14:45.180\n some grad student from like 20 years ago\n\n2:14:45.180 --> 2:14:48.500\n wrote a program in Fortran to visualize it, and that's it.\n\n2:14:48.500 --> 2:14:51.060\n And it's just, you know, it's makes me sad\n\n2:14:51.060 --> 2:14:53.460\n because those are visual disciplines.\n\n2:14:53.460 --> 2:14:56.460\n Just like computer vision is a visual discipline.\n\n2:14:56.460 --> 2:14:59.700\n So you can provide a lot of visual examples.\n\n2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:03.380\n I wish topology was more excited\n\n2:15:03.380 --> 2:15:07.220\n and in love with visualizing some of the ideas.\n\n2:15:07.220 --> 2:15:09.060\n I mean, you could say that, but I would say for me,\n\n2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:11.940\n a picture of the hop vibration does nothing for me.\n\n2:15:11.940 --> 2:15:13.540\n Whereas like when you're like, oh,\n\n2:15:13.540 --> 2:15:14.740\n it's like about the quaternions.\n\n2:15:14.740 --> 2:15:16.100\n It's like a subgroup of the quaternions.\n\n2:15:16.100 --> 2:15:17.860\n And I'm like, oh, so now I see what's going on.\n\n2:15:17.860 --> 2:15:18.900\n Like, why didn't you just say that?\n\n2:15:18.900 --> 2:15:20.580\n Why were you like showing me this stupid picture\n\n2:15:20.580 --> 2:15:22.460\n instead of telling me what you were talking about?\n\n2:15:22.460 --> 2:15:25.020\n Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:15:25.020 --> 2:15:26.460\n I'm just saying, no, but it goes back\n\n2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:27.380\n to what you were saying about teaching\n\n2:15:27.380 --> 2:15:29.780\n that like people are different in what they'll respond to.\n\n2:15:29.780 --> 2:15:32.100\n So I think there's no, I mean, I'm very opposed\n\n2:15:32.100 --> 2:15:34.420\n to the idea that there's a one right way to explain things.\n\n2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:37.260\n I think there's like a huge variation in like, you know,\n\n2:15:37.260 --> 2:15:40.300\n our brains like have all these like weird like hooks\n\n2:15:40.300 --> 2:15:42.100\n and loops and it's like very hard to know\n\n2:15:42.100 --> 2:15:43.300\n like what's gonna latch on\n\n2:15:43.300 --> 2:15:46.140\n and it's not gonna be the same thing for everybody.\n\n2:15:46.140 --> 2:15:49.500\n So I think monoculture is bad, right?\n\n2:15:49.500 --> 2:15:51.580\n I think that's, and I think we're agreeing on that point\n\n2:15:51.580 --> 2:15:53.740\n that like, it's good that there's like a lot\n\n2:15:53.740 --> 2:15:55.540\n of different ways in and a lot of different ways\n\n2:15:55.540 --> 2:15:57.500\n to describe these ideas because different people\n\n2:15:57.500 --> 2:15:59.780\n are gonna find different things illuminating.\n\n2:15:59.780 --> 2:16:04.460\n But that said, I think there's a lot to be discovered\n\n2:16:04.460 --> 2:16:09.460\n when you force little like silos of brilliant people\n\n2:16:11.060 --> 2:16:15.300\n to kind of find a middle ground\n\n2:16:15.300 --> 2:16:20.260\n or like aggregate or come together in a way.\n\n2:16:20.260 --> 2:16:23.580\n So there's like people that do love visual things.\n\n2:16:23.580 --> 2:16:25.740\n I mean, there's a lot of disciplines,\n\n2:16:25.740 --> 2:16:27.020\n especially in computer science\n\n2:16:27.020 --> 2:16:28.900\n that they're obsessed with visualizing,\n\n2:16:28.900 --> 2:16:31.500\n visualizing data, visualizing neural networks.\n\n2:16:31.500 --> 2:16:34.100\n I mean, neural networks themselves are fundamentally visual.\n\n2:16:34.100 --> 2:16:36.700\n There's a lot of work in computer vision that's very visual.\n\n2:16:36.700 --> 2:16:39.140\n And then coming together with some folks\n\n2:16:39.140 --> 2:16:41.020\n that were like deeply rigorous\n\n2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:43.620\n and are like totally lost in multi dimensional space\n\n2:16:43.620 --> 2:16:46.220\n where it's hard to even bring them back down to 3D.\n\n2:16:48.220 --> 2:16:50.300\n They're very comfortable in this multi dimensional space.\n\n2:16:50.300 --> 2:16:53.500\n So forcing them to kind of work together to communicate\n\n2:16:53.500 --> 2:16:57.300\n because it's not just about public communication of ideas.\n\n2:16:57.300 --> 2:16:59.180\n It's also, I feel like when you're forced\n\n2:16:59.180 --> 2:17:02.100\n to do that public communication like you did with your book,\n\n2:17:02.100 --> 2:17:05.780\n I think deep profound ideas can be discovered\n\n2:17:05.780 --> 2:17:08.740\n that's like applicable for research and for science.\n\n2:17:08.740 --> 2:17:10.780\n Like there's something about that simplification\n\n2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:15.380\n or not simplification, but distillation or condensation\n\n2:17:15.380 --> 2:17:17.020\n or whatever the hell you call it,\n\n2:17:17.020 --> 2:17:19.860\n compression of ideas that somehow\n\n2:17:19.860 --> 2:17:22.140\n actually stimulates creativity.\n\n2:17:22.140 --> 2:17:25.220\n And I'd be excited to see more of that\n\n2:17:25.220 --> 2:17:27.820\n in the mathematics community.\n\n2:17:27.820 --> 2:17:28.660\n Can you?\n\n2:17:28.660 --> 2:17:29.500\n Let me make a crazy metaphor.\n\n2:17:29.500 --> 2:17:31.140\n Maybe it's a little bit like the relation\n\n2:17:31.140 --> 2:17:32.620\n between prose and poetry, right?\n\n2:17:32.620 --> 2:17:33.740\n I mean, if you, you might say like,\n\n2:17:33.740 --> 2:17:35.020\n why do we need anything more than prose?\n\n2:17:35.020 --> 2:17:36.460\n You're trying to convey some information.\n\n2:17:36.460 --> 2:17:38.500\n So you just like say it.\n\n2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:40.500\n Well, poetry does something, right?\n\n2:17:40.500 --> 2:17:43.340\n It's sort of, you might think of it as a kind of compression.\n\n2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:44.940\n Of course, not all poetry is compressed.\n\n2:17:44.940 --> 2:17:47.660\n Like not all, some of it is quite baggy,\n\n2:17:47.660 --> 2:17:52.660\n but like you are kind of, often it's compressed, right?\n\n2:17:53.340 --> 2:17:55.620\n A lyric poem is often sort of like a compression\n\n2:17:55.620 --> 2:17:57.740\n of what would take a long time\n\n2:17:57.740 --> 2:18:00.300\n and be complicated to explain in prose\n\n2:18:00.300 --> 2:18:03.300\n into sort of a different mode\n\n2:18:03.300 --> 2:18:05.380\n that is gonna hit in a different way.\n\n2:18:05.380 --> 2:18:08.980\n We talked about Poincare conjecture.\n\n2:18:10.180 --> 2:18:14.620\n There's a guy, he's Russian, Grigori Perlman.\n\n2:18:14.620 --> 2:18:16.620\n He proved Poincare's conjecture.\n\n2:18:16.620 --> 2:18:19.220\n If you can comment on the proof itself,\n\n2:18:19.220 --> 2:18:21.580\n if that stands out to you as something interesting\n\n2:18:21.580 --> 2:18:23.220\n or the human story of it,\n\n2:18:23.220 --> 2:18:27.020\n which is he turned down the field's metal for the proof.\n\n2:18:28.380 --> 2:18:32.780\n Is there something you find inspiring or insightful\n\n2:18:32.780 --> 2:18:36.180\n about the proof itself or about the man?\n\n2:18:36.180 --> 2:18:40.620\n Yeah, I mean, one thing I really like about the proof\n\n2:18:40.620 --> 2:18:42.940\n and partly that's because it's sort of a thing\n\n2:18:42.940 --> 2:18:45.140\n that happens again and again in this book.\n\n2:18:45.140 --> 2:18:46.940\n I mean, I'm writing about geometry and the way\n\n2:18:46.940 --> 2:18:50.220\n it sort of appears in all these kind of real world problems.\n\n2:18:50.220 --> 2:18:52.780\n But it happens so often that the geometry\n\n2:18:52.780 --> 2:18:56.940\n you think you're studying is somehow not enough.\n\n2:18:56.940 --> 2:18:59.260\n You have to go one level higher in abstraction\n\n2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:01.660\n and study a higher level of geometry.\n\n2:19:01.660 --> 2:19:05.380\n And the way that plays out is that Poincare asks a question\n\n2:19:05.380 --> 2:19:07.900\n about a certain kind of three dimensional object.\n\n2:19:07.900 --> 2:19:10.340\n Is it the usual three dimensional space that we know\n\n2:19:10.340 --> 2:19:13.100\n or is it some kind of exotic thing?\n\n2:19:13.100 --> 2:19:15.140\n And so, of course, this sounds like it's a question\n\n2:19:15.140 --> 2:19:17.660\n about the geometry of the three dimensional space,\n\n2:19:17.660 --> 2:19:20.260\n but no, Perelman understands.\n\n2:19:20.260 --> 2:19:21.980\n And by the way, in a tradition that involves\n\n2:19:21.980 --> 2:19:23.580\n Richard Hamilton and many other people,\n\n2:19:23.580 --> 2:19:26.360\n like most really important mathematical advances,\n\n2:19:26.360 --> 2:19:27.460\n this doesn't happen alone.\n\n2:19:27.460 --> 2:19:28.540\n It doesn't happen in a vacuum.\n\n2:19:28.540 --> 2:19:30.220\n It happens as the culmination of a program\n\n2:19:30.220 --> 2:19:31.340\n that involves many people.\n\n2:19:31.340 --> 2:19:32.460\n Same with Wiles, by the way.\n\n2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:34.400\n I mean, we talked about Wiles and I wanna emphasize\n\n2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:36.700\n that starting all the way back with Kummer,\n\n2:19:36.700 --> 2:19:38.220\n who I mentioned in the 19th century,\n\n2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:42.260\n but Gerhard Frey and Mazer and Ken Ribbit\n\n2:19:42.260 --> 2:19:45.260\n and like many other people are involved\n\n2:19:45.260 --> 2:19:47.260\n in building the other pieces of the arch\n\n2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:48.340\n before you put the keystone in.\n\n2:19:48.340 --> 2:19:50.380\n We stand on the shoulders of giants.\n\n2:19:50.380 --> 2:19:51.220\n Yes.\n\n2:19:53.900 --> 2:19:56.100\n So, what is this idea?\n\n2:19:56.100 --> 2:19:57.460\n The idea is that, well, of course,\n\n2:19:57.460 --> 2:19:59.940\n the geometry of the three dimensional object itself\n\n2:19:59.940 --> 2:20:02.500\n is relevant, but the real geometry you have to understand\n\n2:20:02.500 --> 2:20:04.740\n is the geometry of the space\n\n2:20:04.740 --> 2:20:07.420\n of all three dimensional geometries.\n\n2:20:07.420 --> 2:20:10.540\n Whoa, you're going up a higher level.\n\n2:20:10.540 --> 2:20:12.040\n Because when you do that, you can say,\n\n2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:17.040\n now let's trace out a path in that space.\n\n2:20:18.260 --> 2:20:19.840\n There's a mechanism called Ricci flow.\n\n2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:21.100\n And again, we're outside my research area.\n\n2:20:21.100 --> 2:20:23.380\n So for all the geometric analysts\n\n2:20:23.380 --> 2:20:25.820\n and differential geometers out there listening to this,\n\n2:20:25.820 --> 2:20:29.500\n if I, please, I'm doing my best and I'm roughly saying it.\n\n2:20:29.500 --> 2:20:32.220\n So the Ricci flow allows you to say like,\n\n2:20:32.220 --> 2:20:35.400\n okay, let's start from some mystery three dimensional space,\n\n2:20:35.400 --> 2:20:37.740\n which Poincare would conjecture is essentially\n\n2:20:37.740 --> 2:20:39.520\n the same thing as our familiar three dimensional space,\n\n2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:41.260\n but we don't know that.\n\n2:20:41.260 --> 2:20:44.180\n And now you let it flow.\n\n2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:47.500\n You sort of like let it move in its natural path\n\n2:20:47.500 --> 2:20:50.140\n according to some almost physical process\n\n2:20:50.140 --> 2:20:51.460\n and ask where it winds up.\n\n2:20:51.460 --> 2:20:54.360\n And what you find is that it always winds up.\n\n2:20:54.360 --> 2:20:55.740\n You've continuously deformed it.\n\n2:20:55.740 --> 2:20:58.340\n There's that word deformation again.\n\n2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:00.180\n And what you can prove is that the process doesn't stop\n\n2:21:00.180 --> 2:21:02.100\n until you get to the usual three dimensional space.\n\n2:21:02.100 --> 2:21:04.660\n And since you can get from the mystery thing\n\n2:21:04.660 --> 2:21:06.840\n to the standard space by this process\n\n2:21:06.840 --> 2:21:09.900\n of continually changing and never kind of\n\n2:21:09.900 --> 2:21:12.980\n having any sharp transitions,\n\n2:21:12.980 --> 2:21:16.300\n then the original shape must've been the same\n\n2:21:16.300 --> 2:21:17.500\n as the standard shape.\n\n2:21:17.500 --> 2:21:18.780\n That's the nature of the proof.\n\n2:21:18.780 --> 2:21:20.460\n Now, of course, it's incredibly technical.\n\n2:21:20.460 --> 2:21:21.500\n I think as I understand it,\n\n2:21:21.500 --> 2:21:23.360\n I think the hard part is proving\n\n2:21:23.360 --> 2:21:25.640\n that the favorite word of AI people,\n\n2:21:25.640 --> 2:21:27.940\n you don't get any singularities along the way.\n\n2:21:29.460 --> 2:21:30.500\n But of course, in this context,\n\n2:21:30.500 --> 2:21:34.360\n singularity just means acquiring a sharp kink.\n\n2:21:34.360 --> 2:21:37.020\n It just means becoming non smooth at some point.\n\n2:21:37.020 --> 2:21:41.020\n So just saying something interesting about formal,\n\n2:21:41.020 --> 2:21:42.740\n about the smooth trajectory\n\n2:21:42.740 --> 2:21:45.380\n through this weird space of geometries.\n\n2:21:45.380 --> 2:21:46.740\n But yeah, so what I like about it\n\n2:21:46.740 --> 2:21:49.620\n is that it's just one of many examples of where\n\n2:21:49.620 --> 2:21:51.680\n it's not about the geometry you think it's about.\n\n2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:55.980\n It's about the geometry of all geometries, so to speak.\n\n2:21:55.980 --> 2:21:59.600\n And it's only by kind of like being jerked out of flatland.\n\n2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:00.440\n Same idea.\n\n2:22:00.440 --> 2:22:04.160\n It's only by sort of seeing the whole thing globally at once\n\n2:22:04.160 --> 2:22:05.860\n that you can really make progress on understanding\n\n2:22:05.860 --> 2:22:08.440\n the one thing you thought you were looking at.\n\n2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:09.520\n It's a romantic question,\n\n2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:11.140\n but what do you think about him\n\n2:22:11.140 --> 2:22:12.980\n turning down the Fields Medal?\n\n2:22:12.980 --> 2:22:17.020\n Is that just, are Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals\n\n2:22:17.020 --> 2:22:19.980\n just the cherry on top of the cake\n\n2:22:19.980 --> 2:22:24.980\n and really math itself, the process of curiosity,\n\n2:22:25.220 --> 2:22:28.500\n of pulling at the string of the mystery before us?\n\n2:22:28.500 --> 2:22:29.580\n That's the cake?\n\n2:22:29.580 --> 2:22:33.780\n And then the awards are just icing\n\n2:22:33.780 --> 2:22:37.220\n and clearly I've been fasting and I'm hungry,\n\n2:22:37.220 --> 2:22:42.220\n but do you think it's tragic or just a little curiosity\n\n2:22:44.620 --> 2:22:46.380\n that he turned down the medal?\n\n2:22:46.380 --> 2:22:48.460\n Well, it's interesting because on the one hand,\n\n2:22:48.460 --> 2:22:50.780\n I think it's absolutely true that right,\n\n2:22:50.780 --> 2:22:55.500\n in some kind of like vast spiritual sense,\n\n2:22:55.500 --> 2:22:57.380\n like awards are not important,\n\n2:22:57.380 --> 2:22:59.260\n like not important the way that sort of like\n\n2:22:59.260 --> 2:23:01.260\n understanding the universe is important.\n\n2:23:01.260 --> 2:23:04.620\n On the other hand, most people who are offered that prize\n\n2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:07.740\n accept it, so there's something unusual\n\n2:23:07.740 --> 2:23:11.740\n about his choice there.\n\n2:23:11.740 --> 2:23:14.420\n I wouldn't say I see it as tragic.\n\n2:23:14.420 --> 2:23:16.220\n I mean, maybe if I don't really feel like\n\n2:23:16.220 --> 2:23:19.260\n I have a clear picture of why he chose not to take it.\n\n2:23:19.260 --> 2:23:22.060\n I mean, he's not alone in doing things like this.\n\n2:23:22.060 --> 2:23:25.300\n People sometimes turn down prizes for ideological reasons,\n\n2:23:26.540 --> 2:23:28.020\n but probably more often in mathematics.\n\n2:23:28.020 --> 2:23:30.020\n I mean, I think I'm right in saying that\n\n2:23:30.020 --> 2:23:33.940\n Peter Schultz turned down sort of some big monetary prize\n\n2:23:33.940 --> 2:23:36.660\n because he just, you know, I mean, I think he,\n\n2:23:36.660 --> 2:23:39.260\n at some point you have plenty of money\n\n2:23:39.260 --> 2:23:41.340\n and maybe you think it sends the wrong message\n\n2:23:41.340 --> 2:23:44.420\n about what the point of doing mathematics is.\n\n2:23:45.740 --> 2:23:47.540\n I do find that there's most people accept.\n\n2:23:47.540 --> 2:23:48.820\n You know, most people give it a prize.\n\n2:23:48.820 --> 2:23:49.660\n Most people take it.\n\n2:23:49.660 --> 2:23:50.900\n I mean, people like to be appreciated,\n\n2:23:50.900 --> 2:23:53.020\n but like I said, we're people.\n\n2:23:53.020 --> 2:23:54.700\n Not that different from most other people.\n\n2:23:54.700 --> 2:23:57.900\n But the important reminder that that turning down\n\n2:23:57.900 --> 2:24:01.500\n a prize serves for me is not that there's anything wrong\n\n2:24:01.500 --> 2:24:03.580\n with the prize and there's something wonderful\n\n2:24:03.580 --> 2:24:04.940\n about the prize, I think.\n\n2:24:04.940 --> 2:24:07.660\n The Nobel prize is trickier\n\n2:24:07.660 --> 2:24:10.340\n because so many Nobel prizes are given.\n\n2:24:10.340 --> 2:24:12.300\n First of all, the Nobel prize often forgets\n\n2:24:12.300 --> 2:24:15.660\n many, many of the important people throughout history.\n\n2:24:15.660 --> 2:24:18.940\n Second of all, there's like these weird rules to it\n\n2:24:18.940 --> 2:24:20.260\n that it's only three people\n\n2:24:20.260 --> 2:24:22.460\n and some projects have a huge number of people.\n\n2:24:22.460 --> 2:24:26.220\n And it's like this, it, I don't know.\n\n2:24:26.220 --> 2:24:31.180\n It doesn't kind of highlight the way science is done\n\n2:24:31.180 --> 2:24:33.660\n on some of these projects in the best possible way.\n\n2:24:33.660 --> 2:24:34.980\n But in general, the prizes are great.\n\n2:24:34.980 --> 2:24:37.380\n But what this kind of teaches me and reminds me\n\n2:24:37.380 --> 2:24:39.900\n is sometimes in your life, there'll be moments\n\n2:24:41.180 --> 2:24:46.180\n when the thing that you would really like to do,\n\n2:24:47.580 --> 2:24:49.700\n society would really like you to do,\n\n2:24:50.740 --> 2:24:53.940\n is the thing that goes against something you believe in,\n\n2:24:53.940 --> 2:24:56.060\n whatever that is, some kind of principle.\n\n2:24:56.060 --> 2:24:59.860\n And standing your ground in the face of that\n\n2:24:59.860 --> 2:25:03.060\n is something I believe most people will have\n\n2:25:03.060 --> 2:25:05.100\n a few moments like that in their life,\n\n2:25:05.100 --> 2:25:07.460\n maybe one moment like that, and you have to do it.\n\n2:25:07.460 --> 2:25:09.100\n That's what integrity is.\n\n2:25:09.100 --> 2:25:10.460\n So like, it doesn't have to make sense\n\n2:25:10.460 --> 2:25:12.340\n to the rest of the world, but to stand on that,\n\n2:25:12.340 --> 2:25:16.060\n like to say no, it's interesting, because I think.\n\n2:25:16.060 --> 2:25:17.740\n But do you know that he turned down the prize\n\n2:25:17.740 --> 2:25:20.020\n in service of some principle?\n\n2:25:20.020 --> 2:25:20.980\n Because I don't know that.\n\n2:25:20.980 --> 2:25:22.740\n Well, yes, that seems to be the inkling,\n\n2:25:22.740 --> 2:25:24.540\n but he has never made it super clear.\n\n2:25:24.540 --> 2:25:26.900\n But the inkling is that he had some problems\n\n2:25:26.900 --> 2:25:30.220\n with the whole process of mathematics that includes awards,\n\n2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:33.500\n like this hierarchies and the reputations\n\n2:25:33.500 --> 2:25:34.500\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:37.660\n and individualism that's fundamental to American culture.\n\n2:25:37.660 --> 2:25:41.140\n He probably, because he visited the United States quite a bit\n\n2:25:41.140 --> 2:25:46.140\n that he probably, it's all about experiences.\n\n2:25:47.380 --> 2:25:51.500\n And he may have had some parts of academia,\n\n2:25:51.500 --> 2:25:54.740\n some pockets of academia can be less than inspiring,\n\n2:25:54.740 --> 2:25:57.580\n perhaps sometimes, because of the individual egos involved,\n\n2:25:57.580 --> 2:26:01.180\n not academia, people in general, smart people with egos.\n\n2:26:01.180 --> 2:26:05.620\n And if you interact with a certain kinds of people,\n\n2:26:05.620 --> 2:26:07.460\n you can become cynical too easily.\n\n2:26:07.460 --> 2:26:10.700\n I'm one of those people that I've been really fortunate\n\n2:26:10.700 --> 2:26:12.820\n to interact with incredible people at MIT\n\n2:26:12.820 --> 2:26:15.500\n and academia in general, but I've met some assholes.\n\n2:26:15.500 --> 2:26:17.060\n And I tend to just kind of,\n\n2:26:17.060 --> 2:26:19.140\n when I run into difficult folks,\n\n2:26:19.140 --> 2:26:21.340\n I just kind of smile and send them all my love\n\n2:26:21.340 --> 2:26:23.100\n and just kind of go around.\n\n2:26:23.100 --> 2:26:26.700\n But for others, those experiences can be sticky.\n\n2:26:26.700 --> 2:26:29.820\n Like they can become cynical about the world\n\n2:26:29.820 --> 2:26:31.660\n when folks like that exist.\n\n2:26:31.660 --> 2:26:35.500\n So he may have become a little bit cynical\n\n2:26:35.500 --> 2:26:37.220\n about the process of science.\n\n2:26:37.220 --> 2:26:38.620\n Well, you know, it's a good opportunity.\n\n2:26:38.620 --> 2:26:40.220\n Let's posit that that's his reasoning\n\n2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.380\n because I truly don't know.\n\n2:26:42.380 --> 2:26:43.820\n It's an interesting opportunity to go back\n\n2:26:43.820 --> 2:26:46.340\n to almost the very first thing we talked about,\n\n2:26:46.340 --> 2:26:48.380\n the idea of the Mathematical Olympiad,\n\n2:26:48.380 --> 2:26:50.540\n because of course that is,\n\n2:26:50.540 --> 2:26:52.100\n so the International Mathematical Olympiad\n\n2:26:52.100 --> 2:26:54.620\n is like a competition for high school students\n\n2:26:54.620 --> 2:26:55.860\n solving math problems.\n\n2:26:55.860 --> 2:26:59.180\n And in some sense, it's absolutely false\n\n2:26:59.180 --> 2:27:00.380\n to the reality of mathematics,\n\n2:27:00.380 --> 2:27:02.060\n because just as you say,\n\n2:27:02.060 --> 2:27:05.220\n it is a contest where you win prizes.\n\n2:27:07.380 --> 2:27:10.140\n The aim is to sort of be faster than other people.\n\n2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:13.860\n And you're working on sort of canned problems\n\n2:27:13.860 --> 2:27:15.700\n that someone already knows the answer to,\n\n2:27:15.700 --> 2:27:18.500\n like not problems that are unknown.\n\n2:27:18.500 --> 2:27:20.580\n So, you know, in my own life,\n\n2:27:20.580 --> 2:27:21.900\n I think when I was in high school,\n\n2:27:21.900 --> 2:27:24.260\n I was like very motivated by those competitions.\n\n2:27:24.260 --> 2:27:26.140\n And like, I went to the Math Olympiad and...\n\n2:27:26.140 --> 2:27:28.580\n You won it twice and got, I mean...\n\n2:27:28.580 --> 2:27:30.180\n Well, there's something I have to explain to people\n\n2:27:30.180 --> 2:27:32.220\n because it says, I think it says on Wikipedia\n\n2:27:32.220 --> 2:27:33.420\n that I won a gold medal.\n\n2:27:33.420 --> 2:27:35.220\n And in the real Olympics,\n\n2:27:35.220 --> 2:27:37.420\n they only give one gold medal in each event.\n\n2:27:37.420 --> 2:27:38.460\n I just have to emphasize\n\n2:27:38.460 --> 2:27:40.820\n that the International Math Olympiad is not like that.\n\n2:27:40.820 --> 2:27:42.220\n The gold medals are awarded\n\n2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:44.980\n to the top 112th of all participants.\n\n2:27:44.980 --> 2:27:47.260\n So sorry to bust the legend or anything like that.\n\n2:27:47.260 --> 2:27:48.860\n Well, you're an exceptional performer\n\n2:27:48.860 --> 2:27:51.860\n in terms of achieving high scores on the problems\n\n2:27:51.860 --> 2:27:53.220\n and they're very difficult.\n\n2:27:53.220 --> 2:27:56.300\n So you've achieved a high level of performance on the...\n\n2:27:56.300 --> 2:27:57.900\n In this very specialized skill.\n\n2:27:57.900 --> 2:28:00.540\n And by the way, it was a very Cold War activity.\n\n2:28:00.540 --> 2:28:02.900\n You know, in 1987, the first year I went,\n\n2:28:02.900 --> 2:28:04.620\n it was in Havana.\n\n2:28:04.620 --> 2:28:06.140\n Americans couldn't go to Havana back then.\n\n2:28:06.140 --> 2:28:08.740\n It was a very complicated process to get there.\n\n2:28:08.740 --> 2:28:10.860\n And they took the whole American team on a field trip\n\n2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:14.140\n to the Museum of American Imperialism in Havana\n\n2:28:14.140 --> 2:28:17.580\n so we could see what America was all about.\n\n2:28:17.580 --> 2:28:22.580\n How would you recommend a person learn math?\n\n2:28:22.980 --> 2:28:26.380\n So somebody who's young or somebody my age\n\n2:28:26.380 --> 2:28:29.740\n or somebody older who've taken a bunch of math\n\n2:28:29.740 --> 2:28:32.060\n but wants to rediscover the beauty of math\n\n2:28:32.060 --> 2:28:34.260\n and maybe integrate it into their work\n\n2:28:34.260 --> 2:28:38.540\n more solid in the research space and so on.\n\n2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:44.220\n Is there something you could say about the process of...\n\n2:28:44.220 --> 2:28:47.620\n Incorporating mathematical thinking into your life?\n\n2:28:47.620 --> 2:28:48.900\n I mean, the thing is,\n\n2:28:48.900 --> 2:28:50.860\n it's in part a journey of self knowledge.\n\n2:28:50.860 --> 2:28:53.740\n You have to know what's gonna work for you\n\n2:28:53.740 --> 2:28:55.940\n and that's gonna be different for different people.\n\n2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:59.260\n So there are totally people who at any stage of life\n\n2:28:59.260 --> 2:29:01.980\n just start reading math textbooks.\n\n2:29:01.980 --> 2:29:03.660\n That is a thing that you can do\n\n2:29:03.660 --> 2:29:06.580\n and it works for some people and not for others.\n\n2:29:06.580 --> 2:29:09.620\n For others, a gateway is, I always recommend\n\n2:29:09.620 --> 2:29:10.820\n the books of Martin Gardner,\n\n2:29:10.820 --> 2:29:12.620\n another sort of person we haven't talked about\n\n2:29:12.620 --> 2:29:16.860\n but who also, like Conway, embodies that spirit of play.\n\n2:29:16.860 --> 2:29:19.460\n He wrote a column in Scientific American for decades\n\n2:29:19.460 --> 2:29:20.980\n called Mathematical Recreations\n\n2:29:20.980 --> 2:29:23.940\n and there's such joy in it and such fun.\n\n2:29:23.940 --> 2:29:26.580\n And these books, the columns are collected into books\n\n2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:27.660\n and the books are old now\n\n2:29:27.660 --> 2:29:29.740\n but for each generation of people who discover them,\n\n2:29:29.740 --> 2:29:31.420\n they're completely fresh.\n\n2:29:31.420 --> 2:29:33.860\n And they give a totally different way into the subject\n\n2:29:33.860 --> 2:29:36.420\n than reading a formal textbook,\n\n2:29:36.420 --> 2:29:40.060\n which for some people would be the right thing to do.\n\n2:29:40.060 --> 2:29:42.260\n And working contest style problems too,\n\n2:29:42.260 --> 2:29:43.740\n those are bound to books,\n\n2:29:43.740 --> 2:29:45.660\n especially like Russian and Bulgarian problems.\n\n2:29:45.660 --> 2:29:47.740\n There's book after book problems from those contexts.\n\n2:29:47.740 --> 2:29:50.060\n That's gonna motivate some people.\n\n2:29:50.060 --> 2:29:51.580\n For some people, it's gonna be like watching\n\n2:29:51.580 --> 2:29:54.300\n well produced videos, like a totally different format.\n\n2:29:54.300 --> 2:29:56.060\n Like I feel like I'm not answering your question.\n\n2:29:56.060 --> 2:29:57.780\n I'm sort of saying there's no one answer\n\n2:29:57.780 --> 2:30:00.340\n and it's a journey where you figure out\n\n2:30:00.340 --> 2:30:01.900\n what resonates with you.\n\n2:30:01.900 --> 2:30:04.300\n For some people, it's the self discovery\n\n2:30:04.300 --> 2:30:06.780\n is trying to figure out why is it that I wanna know?\n\n2:30:06.780 --> 2:30:07.620\n Okay, I'll tell you a story.\n\n2:30:07.620 --> 2:30:09.500\n Once when I was in grad school,\n\n2:30:09.500 --> 2:30:11.540\n I was very frustrated with my lack of knowledge\n\n2:30:11.540 --> 2:30:13.140\n of a lot of things as we all are\n\n2:30:13.140 --> 2:30:14.100\n because no matter how much we know,\n\n2:30:14.100 --> 2:30:15.820\n we don't know much more and going to grad school\n\n2:30:15.820 --> 2:30:17.220\n means just coming face to face\n\n2:30:17.220 --> 2:30:20.340\n with the incredible overflowing vault of your ignorance.\n\n2:30:20.340 --> 2:30:23.740\n So I told Joe Harris, who was an algebraic geometer,\n\n2:30:23.740 --> 2:30:26.140\n a professor in my department,\n\n2:30:26.140 --> 2:30:27.620\n I was like, I really feel like I don't know enough\n\n2:30:27.620 --> 2:30:29.340\n and I should just take a year of leave\n\n2:30:29.340 --> 2:30:32.620\n and just read EGA, the holy textbook,\n\n2:30:32.620 --> 2:30:34.420\n Elements de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Algebraique,\n\n2:30:34.420 --> 2:30:36.900\n the Elements of Algebraic Geometry.\n\n2:30:36.900 --> 2:30:38.660\n I'm just gonna, I feel like I don't know enough\n\n2:30:38.660 --> 2:30:42.060\n so I'm just gonna sit and read this like 1500 page\n\n2:30:42.060 --> 2:30:44.060\n many volume book.\n\n2:30:46.900 --> 2:30:48.300\n And he was like, and Professor Harris was like,\n\n2:30:48.300 --> 2:30:49.500\n that's a really stupid idea.\n\n2:30:49.500 --> 2:30:50.820\n And I was like, why is that a stupid idea?\n\n2:30:50.820 --> 2:30:52.660\n Then I would know more algebraic geometry.\n\n2:30:52.660 --> 2:30:53.940\n He's like, because you're not actually gonna do it.\n\n2:30:53.940 --> 2:30:55.780\n Like you learn.\n\n2:30:55.780 --> 2:30:57.140\n I mean, he knew me well enough to say like,\n\n2:30:57.140 --> 2:30:58.860\n you're gonna learn because you're gonna be working\n\n2:30:58.860 --> 2:31:01.060\n on a problem and then there's gonna be a fact from EGA\n\n2:31:01.060 --> 2:31:03.020\n that you need in order to solve your problem\n\n2:31:03.020 --> 2:31:05.300\n that you wanna solve and that's how you're gonna learn it.\n\n2:31:05.300 --> 2:31:06.820\n You're not gonna learn it without a problem\n\n2:31:06.820 --> 2:31:08.020\n to bring you into it.\n\n2:31:08.020 --> 2:31:10.660\n And so for a lot of people, I think if you're like,\n\n2:31:10.660 --> 2:31:12.420\n I'm trying to understand machine learning\n\n2:31:12.420 --> 2:31:14.460\n and I'm like, I can see that there's sort of\n\n2:31:14.460 --> 2:31:19.460\n some mathematical technology that I don't have,\n\n2:31:19.460 --> 2:31:22.580\n I think you like let that problem\n\n2:31:22.580 --> 2:31:26.060\n that you actually care about drive your learning.\n\n2:31:26.060 --> 2:31:28.340\n I mean, one thing I've learned from advising students,\n\n2:31:28.340 --> 2:31:31.220\n math is really hard.\n\n2:31:32.260 --> 2:31:35.940\n In fact, anything that you do right is hard.\n\n2:31:38.180 --> 2:31:41.420\n And because it's hard, like you might sort of have some idea\n\n2:31:41.420 --> 2:31:44.540\n that somebody else gives you, oh, I should learn X, Y and Z.\n\n2:31:44.540 --> 2:31:46.460\n Well, if you don't actually care, you're not gonna do it.\n\n2:31:46.460 --> 2:31:47.500\n You might feel like you should,\n\n2:31:47.500 --> 2:31:48.940\n maybe somebody told you you should,\n\n2:31:48.940 --> 2:31:51.820\n but I think you have to hook it to something\n\n2:31:51.820 --> 2:31:52.780\n that you actually care about.\n\n2:31:52.780 --> 2:31:54.580\n So for a lot of people, that's the way in.\n\n2:31:54.580 --> 2:31:57.260\n You have an engineering problem you're trying to handle,\n\n2:31:57.260 --> 2:31:59.580\n you have a physics problem you're trying to handle,\n\n2:31:59.580 --> 2:32:02.100\n you have a machine learning problem you're trying to handle.\n\n2:32:02.100 --> 2:32:05.020\n Let that not a kind of abstract idea\n\n2:32:05.020 --> 2:32:08.420\n of what the curriculum is, drive your mathematical learning.\n\n2:32:08.420 --> 2:32:12.260\n And also just as a brief comment that math is hard,\n\n2:32:12.260 --> 2:32:15.300\n there's a sense to which hard is a feature, not a bug,\n\n2:32:15.300 --> 2:32:17.060\n in the sense that, again,\n\n2:32:17.060 --> 2:32:19.820\n maybe this is my own learning preference,\n\n2:32:19.820 --> 2:32:24.500\n but I think it's a value to fall in love with the process\n\n2:32:24.500 --> 2:32:27.980\n of doing something hard, overcoming it,\n\n2:32:27.980 --> 2:32:29.740\n and becoming a better person because of it.\n\n2:32:29.740 --> 2:32:32.180\n Like I hate running, I hate exercise,\n\n2:32:32.180 --> 2:32:34.540\n to bring it down to like the simplest hard.\n\n2:32:35.700 --> 2:32:39.740\n And I enjoy the part once it's done,\n\n2:32:39.740 --> 2:32:41.980\n the person I feel like in the rest of the day\n\n2:32:41.980 --> 2:32:44.100\n once I've accomplished it, the actual process,\n\n2:32:44.100 --> 2:32:47.540\n especially the process of getting started in the initial,\n\n2:32:47.540 --> 2:32:49.580\n like it really, I don't feel like doing it.\n\n2:32:49.580 --> 2:32:51.660\n And I really have, the way I feel about running\n\n2:32:51.660 --> 2:32:55.060\n is the way I feel about really anything difficult\n\n2:32:55.060 --> 2:32:58.460\n in the intellectual space, especially in mathematics,\n\n2:32:58.460 --> 2:33:01.820\n but also just something that requires\n\n2:33:01.820 --> 2:33:04.820\n like holding a bunch of concepts in your mind\n\n2:33:04.820 --> 2:33:08.220\n with some uncertainty, like where the terminology\n\n2:33:08.220 --> 2:33:10.220\n or the notation is not very clear.\n\n2:33:10.220 --> 2:33:13.300\n And so you have to kind of hold all those things together\n\n2:33:13.300 --> 2:33:16.020\n and like keep pushing forward through the frustration\n\n2:33:16.020 --> 2:33:20.220\n of really like obviously not understanding certain like\n\n2:33:20.220 --> 2:33:23.660\n parts of the picture, like your giant missing parts\n\n2:33:23.660 --> 2:33:26.580\n of the picture and still not giving up.\n\n2:33:26.580 --> 2:33:28.980\n It's the same way I feel about running.\n\n2:33:28.980 --> 2:33:32.820\n And there's something about falling in love\n\n2:33:32.820 --> 2:33:36.140\n with the feeling of after you went through the journey\n\n2:33:36.140 --> 2:33:38.180\n of not having a complete picture,\n\n2:33:38.180 --> 2:33:40.620\n at the end having a complete picture,\n\n2:33:40.620 --> 2:33:42.460\n and then you get to appreciate the beauty\n\n2:33:42.460 --> 2:33:46.020\n and just remembering that it sucked for a long time\n\n2:33:46.020 --> 2:33:48.780\n and how great it felt when you figured it out,\n\n2:33:48.780 --> 2:33:49.940\n at least at the basic.\n\n2:33:49.940 --> 2:33:52.020\n That's not sort of research thinking,\n\n2:33:52.020 --> 2:33:55.220\n because with research, you probably also have to\n\n2:33:55.220 --> 2:34:00.220\n enjoy the dead ends with learning math\n\n2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:02.540\n from a textbook or from video.\n\n2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:03.380\n There's a nice.\n\n2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:04.580\n I don't think you have to enjoy the dead ends,\n\n2:34:04.580 --> 2:34:06.340\n but I think you have to accept the dead ends.\n\n2:34:06.340 --> 2:34:07.980\n Let's put it that way.\n\n2:34:08.900 --> 2:34:11.020\n Well, yeah, enjoy the suffering of it.\n\n2:34:11.020 --> 2:34:16.020\n So the way I think about it, I do, there's an.\n\n2:34:17.060 --> 2:34:18.300\n I don't enjoy the suffering.\n\n2:34:18.300 --> 2:34:19.140\n It pisses me off.\n\n2:34:19.140 --> 2:34:21.220\n You have to accept that it's part of the process.\n\n2:34:21.220 --> 2:34:22.060\n It's interesting.\n\n2:34:22.060 --> 2:34:24.540\n There's a lot of ways to kind of deal with that dead end.\n\n2:34:24.540 --> 2:34:26.460\n There's a guy who's the ultra marathon runner,\n\n2:34:26.460 --> 2:34:30.340\n Navy SEAL, David Goggins, who kind of,\n\n2:34:30.340 --> 2:34:32.780\n I mean, there's a certain philosophy of like,\n\n2:34:34.020 --> 2:34:35.980\n most people would quit here.\n\n2:34:37.740 --> 2:34:42.420\n And so if most people would quit here and I don't,\n\n2:34:42.420 --> 2:34:45.140\n I'll have an opportunity to discover something beautiful\n\n2:34:45.140 --> 2:34:46.380\n that others haven't yet.\n\n2:34:46.380 --> 2:34:51.380\n And so like any feeling that really sucks,\n\n2:34:52.940 --> 2:34:56.980\n it's like, okay, most people would just like,\n\n2:34:56.980 --> 2:34:58.620\n go do something smarter.\n\n2:34:58.620 --> 2:35:00.220\n And if I stick with this,\n\n2:35:01.220 --> 2:35:06.140\n I will discover a new garden of fruit trees that I can pick.\n\n2:35:06.140 --> 2:35:07.500\n Okay, you say that, but like,\n\n2:35:07.500 --> 2:35:09.100\n what about the guy who like wins\n\n2:35:09.100 --> 2:35:11.300\n the Nathan's hot dog eating contest every year?\n\n2:35:11.300 --> 2:35:13.020\n Like when he eats his 35th hot dog,\n\n2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:14.180\n he like correctly says like,\n\n2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:17.020\n okay, most people would stop here.\n\n2:35:17.020 --> 2:35:18.460\n Are you like lauding that he's like,\n\n2:35:18.460 --> 2:35:20.020\n no, I'm gonna eat the 35th hot dog.\n\n2:35:20.020 --> 2:35:21.580\n I am, I am.\n\n2:35:21.580 --> 2:35:26.300\n In the long arc of history, that man is onto something.\n\n2:35:26.300 --> 2:35:28.420\n Which brings up this question.\n\n2:35:28.420 --> 2:35:30.980\n What advice would you give to young people today,\n\n2:35:30.980 --> 2:35:34.020\n thinking about their career, about their life,\n\n2:35:34.020 --> 2:35:37.300\n whether it's in mathematics, poetry,\n\n2:35:37.300 --> 2:35:39.420\n or hot dog eating contest?\n\n2:35:40.660 --> 2:35:41.940\n And you know, I have kids,\n\n2:35:41.940 --> 2:35:43.900\n so this is actually a live issue for me, right?\n\n2:35:43.900 --> 2:35:45.740\n I actually, it's not a thought experiment.\n\n2:35:45.740 --> 2:35:47.140\n I actually do have to give advice\n\n2:35:47.140 --> 2:35:48.540\n to two young people all the time.\n\n2:35:48.540 --> 2:35:50.540\n They don't listen, but I still give it.\n\n2:35:53.180 --> 2:35:55.420\n You know, one thing I often say to students,\n\n2:35:55.420 --> 2:35:56.820\n I don't think I've actually said this to my kids yet,\n\n2:35:56.820 --> 2:35:59.860\n but I say it to students a lot is,\n\n2:35:59.860 --> 2:36:02.100\n you know, you come to these decision points\n\n2:36:03.100 --> 2:36:06.620\n and everybody is beset by self doubt, right?\n\n2:36:06.620 --> 2:36:09.780\n It's like, not sure like what they're capable of,\n\n2:36:09.780 --> 2:36:14.780\n like not sure what they really wanna do.\n\n2:36:14.780 --> 2:36:16.540\n I always, I sort of tell people like,\n\n2:36:16.540 --> 2:36:18.540\n often when you have a decision to make,\n\n2:36:20.260 --> 2:36:22.740\n one of the choices is the high self esteem choice.\n\n2:36:22.740 --> 2:36:24.620\n And I always tell them, make the high self esteem choice.\n\n2:36:24.620 --> 2:36:26.780\n Make the choice, sort of take yourself out of it\n\n2:36:26.780 --> 2:36:29.620\n and like, if you didn't have those,\n\n2:36:29.620 --> 2:36:31.980\n you can probably figure out what the version of you\n\n2:36:31.980 --> 2:36:34.100\n that feels completely confident would do.\n\n2:36:35.020 --> 2:36:36.500\n And do that and see what happens.\n\n2:36:36.500 --> 2:36:40.100\n And I think that's often like pretty good advice.\n\n2:36:40.100 --> 2:36:40.940\n That's interesting.\n\n2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:44.060\n Sort of like, you know, like with Sims,\n\n2:36:44.060 --> 2:36:45.420\n you can create characters.\n\n2:36:45.420 --> 2:36:47.820\n Create a character of yourself\n\n2:36:47.820 --> 2:36:50.260\n that lacks all the self doubt.\n\n2:36:50.260 --> 2:36:51.340\n Right, but it doesn't mean,\n\n2:36:51.340 --> 2:36:52.940\n I would never say to somebody,\n\n2:36:52.940 --> 2:36:56.220\n you should just go have high self esteem.\n\n2:36:56.220 --> 2:36:57.180\n You shouldn't have doubts.\n\n2:36:57.180 --> 2:36:58.220\n No, you probably should have doubts.\n\n2:36:58.220 --> 2:36:59.340\n It's okay to have them.\n\n2:36:59.340 --> 2:37:01.660\n But sometimes it's good to act in the way\n\n2:37:01.660 --> 2:37:04.240\n that the person who didn't have them would act.\n\n2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:08.420\n That's a really nice way to put it.\n\n2:37:08.420 --> 2:37:13.020\n Yeah, that's like from a third person perspective,\n\n2:37:13.020 --> 2:37:16.500\n take the part of your brain that wants to do big things.\n\n2:37:16.500 --> 2:37:18.140\n What would they do?\n\n2:37:18.140 --> 2:37:20.020\n That's not afraid to do those things.\n\n2:37:20.020 --> 2:37:21.480\n What would they do?\n\n2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:24.420\n Yeah, that's really nice.\n\n2:37:24.420 --> 2:37:26.300\n That's actually a really nice way to formulate it.\n\n2:37:26.300 --> 2:37:27.540\n That's very practical advice.\n\n2:37:27.540 --> 2:37:29.140\n You should give it to your kids.\n\n2:37:31.140 --> 2:37:32.660\n Do you think there's meaning to any of it\n\n2:37:32.660 --> 2:37:35.780\n from a mathematical perspective, this life?\n\n2:37:36.700 --> 2:37:37.820\n If I were to ask you,\n\n2:37:39.180 --> 2:37:42.480\n we talked about primes, talked about proving stuff.\n\n2:37:43.540 --> 2:37:47.340\n Can we say, and then the book that God has,\n\n2:37:47.340 --> 2:37:49.540\n that mathematics allows us to arrive\n\n2:37:49.540 --> 2:37:51.800\n at something about in that book.\n\n2:37:51.800 --> 2:37:52.820\n There's certainly a chapter\n\n2:37:52.820 --> 2:37:54.980\n on the meaning of life in that book.\n\n2:37:54.980 --> 2:37:57.380\n Do you think we humans can get to it?\n\n2:37:57.380 --> 2:37:59.500\n And maybe if you were to write cliff notes,\n\n2:37:59.500 --> 2:38:01.520\n what do you suspect those cliff notes would say?\n\n2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:04.860\n I mean, look, the way I feel is that mathematics,\n\n2:38:04.860 --> 2:38:07.580\n as we've discussed, it underlies the way we think\n\n2:38:07.580 --> 2:38:09.240\n about constructing learning machines.\n\n2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:10.580\n It underlies physics.\n\n2:38:11.780 --> 2:38:12.620\n It can be used.\n\n2:38:12.620 --> 2:38:14.620\n I mean, it does all this stuff.\n\n2:38:15.740 --> 2:38:17.180\n And also you want the meaning of life?\n\n2:38:17.180 --> 2:38:18.820\n I mean, it's like, we already did a lot for you.\n\n2:38:18.820 --> 2:38:19.880\n Like, ask a rabbi.\n\n2:38:22.580 --> 2:38:25.900\n No, I mean, I wrote a lot in the last book,\n\n2:38:25.900 --> 2:38:27.700\n How Not to Be Wrong.\n\n2:38:27.700 --> 2:38:32.380\n I wrote a lot about Pascal, a fascinating guy who is\n\n2:38:32.380 --> 2:38:35.180\n a sort of very serious religious mystic,\n\n2:38:35.180 --> 2:38:37.260\n as well as being an amazing mathematician.\n\n2:38:37.260 --> 2:38:38.900\n And he's well known for Pascal's wager.\n\n2:38:38.900 --> 2:38:40.260\n I mean, he's probably among all mathematicians.\n\n2:38:40.260 --> 2:38:42.340\n He's the one who's best known for this.\n\n2:38:42.340 --> 2:38:44.140\n Can you actually like apply mathematics\n\n2:38:44.140 --> 2:38:48.940\n to kind of these transcendent questions?\n\n2:38:49.900 --> 2:38:53.020\n But what's interesting when I really read Pascal\n\n2:38:53.020 --> 2:38:54.780\n about what he wrote about this,\n\n2:38:54.780 --> 2:38:56.300\n I started to see that people often think,\n\n2:38:56.300 --> 2:38:58.940\n oh, this is him saying, I'm gonna use mathematics\n\n2:39:00.060 --> 2:39:03.340\n to sort of show you why you should believe in God.\n\n2:39:03.340 --> 2:39:07.220\n You know, mathematics has the answer to this question.\n\n2:39:07.220 --> 2:39:08.940\n But he really doesn't say that.\n\n2:39:08.940 --> 2:39:11.900\n He almost kind of says the opposite.\n\n2:39:11.900 --> 2:39:15.140\n If you ask Blaise Pascal, like, why do you believe in God?\n\n2:39:15.140 --> 2:39:16.580\n He'd be like, oh, cause I met God.\n\n2:39:16.580 --> 2:39:20.140\n You know, he had this kind of like psychedelic experience.\n\n2:39:20.140 --> 2:39:23.400\n It's like a mystical experience where as he tells it,\n\n2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:24.980\n he just like directly encountered God.\n\n2:39:24.980 --> 2:39:26.820\n It's like, okay, I guess there's a God, I met him last night.\n\n2:39:26.820 --> 2:39:27.980\n So that's it.\n\n2:39:27.980 --> 2:39:29.100\n That's why he believed.\n\n2:39:29.100 --> 2:39:30.340\n It didn't have to do with any kind.\n\n2:39:30.340 --> 2:39:32.540\n You know, the mathematical argument was like\n\n2:39:33.700 --> 2:39:36.780\n about certain reasons for behaving in a certain way.\n\n2:39:36.780 --> 2:39:38.340\n But he basically said, like, look,\n\n2:39:38.340 --> 2:39:41.100\n like math doesn't tell you that God's there or not.\n\n2:39:41.100 --> 2:39:43.420\n Like, if God's there, he'll tell you.\n\n2:39:43.420 --> 2:39:45.180\n You know, you don't even.\n\n2:39:45.180 --> 2:39:46.020\n I love this.\n\n2:39:46.020 --> 2:39:50.500\n So you have mathematics, you have, what do you have?\n\n2:39:50.500 --> 2:39:53.780\n Like a way to explore the mind, let's say psychedelics.\n\n2:39:53.780 --> 2:39:56.620\n You have like incredible technology.\n\n2:39:56.620 --> 2:39:59.700\n You also have love and friendship.\n\n2:39:59.700 --> 2:40:01.820\n And like, what the hell do you want to know\n\n2:40:01.820 --> 2:40:02.920\n what the meaning of it all is?\n\n2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:03.980\n Just enjoy it.\n\n2:40:03.980 --> 2:40:07.020\n I don't think there's a better way to end it, Jordan.\n\n2:40:07.020 --> 2:40:08.540\n This was a fascinating conversation.\n\n2:40:08.540 --> 2:40:13.540\n I really love the way you explore math in your writing.\n\n2:40:14.140 --> 2:40:18.460\n The willingness to be specific and clear\n\n2:40:18.460 --> 2:40:21.200\n and actually explore difficult ideas,\n\n2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:23.100\n but at the same time stepping outside\n\n2:40:23.100 --> 2:40:25.060\n and figuring out beautiful stuff.\n\n2:40:25.060 --> 2:40:30.060\n And I love the chart at the opening of your new book\n\n2:40:30.380 --> 2:40:33.280\n that shows the chaos, the mess that is your mind.\n\n2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:35.540\n Yes, this is what I was trying to keep in my head\n\n2:40:35.540 --> 2:40:38.020\n all at once while I was writing.\n\n2:40:38.020 --> 2:40:40.300\n And I probably should have drawn this picture\n\n2:40:40.300 --> 2:40:41.300\n earlier in the process.\n\n2:40:41.300 --> 2:40:43.100\n Maybe it would have made my organization easier.\n\n2:40:43.100 --> 2:40:45.420\n I actually drew it only at the end.\n\n2:40:45.420 --> 2:40:48.640\n And many of the things we talked about are on this map.\n\n2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:52.660\n The connections are yet to be fully dissected, investigated.\n\n2:40:52.660 --> 2:40:56.740\n And yes, God is in the picture.\n\n2:40:56.740 --> 2:40:59.460\n Right on the edge, right on the edge, not in the center.\n\n2:41:00.820 --> 2:41:01.660\n Thank you so much for talking to me.\n\n2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:03.460\n It is a huge honor that you would waste\n\n2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:04.820\n your valuable time with me.\n\n2:41:05.820 --> 2:41:06.660\n Thank you, Lex.\n\n2:41:06.660 --> 2:41:07.820\n We went to some amazing places today.\n\n2:41:07.820 --> 2:41:09.620\n This was really fun.\n\n2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:11.220\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:41:11.220 --> 2:41:12.380\n with Jordan Ellenberg.\n\n2:41:12.380 --> 2:41:16.660\n And thank you to Secret Sauce, ExpressVPN, Blinkist,\n\n2:41:16.660 --> 2:41:17.980\n and Indeed.\n\n2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:21.380\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n2:41:21.380 --> 2:41:24.140\n And now let me leave you with some words from Jordan\n\n2:41:24.140 --> 2:41:26.720\n in his book, How Not To Be Wrong.\n\n2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:30.600\n Knowing mathematics is like wearing a pair of X ray specs\n\n2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:33.500\n that reveal hidden structures underneath the messy\n\n2:41:33.500 --> 2:41:35.780\n and chaotic surface of the world.\n\n2:41:35.780 --> 2:42:02.780\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
