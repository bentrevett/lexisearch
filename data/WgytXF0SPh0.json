why are we surprised at the powerful rise\n\n00:07.840 --> 00:10.880\n and that they use the powerless for their purposes?\n\n00:10.880 --> 00:13.740\n When we forget ideas like equality and rights,\n\n00:13.740 --> 00:15.000\n which are grounded in God,\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:18.020\n why are we surprised that death camps follow?\n\n00:20.480 --> 00:24.040\n The following is a conversation with Bishop Robert Barron,\n\n00:24.040 --> 00:28.060\n founder of Word on Fire and one of the greatest educators\n\n00:28.060 --> 00:32.040\n in the world on the beauty and wisdom within Catholicism,\n\n00:32.040 --> 00:35.600\n Christianity, and religious faith in general.\n\n00:35.600 --> 00:37.720\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:37.720 --> 00:39.760\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:39.760 --> 00:41.120\n in the description.\n\n00:41.120 --> 00:44.580\n And now, dear friends, here's Bishop Robert Barron.\n\n00:45.520 --> 00:47.560\n Let's start with the big question.\n\n00:47.560 --> 00:49.960\n Who is God?\n\n00:49.960 --> 00:52.400\n According to Christianity, according to Catholicism,\n\n00:52.400 --> 00:53.360\n who's God?\n\n00:53.360 --> 00:55.320\n I'll give you Thomas Aquinas's definition.\n\n00:55.320 --> 00:57.840\n God is ipsum, essay, subsistence.\n\n00:57.840 --> 01:01.400\n God is the subsistent act of to be itself.\n\n01:01.400 --> 01:03.120\n Another way to state that in Aquinas\n\n01:03.120 --> 01:06.880\n is God is that reality, unique, absolutely unique,\n\n01:06.880 --> 01:09.760\n in which essence and existence coincide.\n\n01:09.760 --> 01:12.280\n To be God is to be to be.\n\n01:12.280 --> 01:15.480\n Those are all ways of talking about what we mean by God.\n\n01:15.480 --> 01:18.560\n They are kind of nomic, and that's on purpose.\n\n01:18.560 --> 01:20.400\n There's almost a Zen koan kind of quality\n\n01:20.400 --> 01:22.640\n about the way we talk about God.\n\n01:22.640 --> 01:25.800\n I'm saying something that's substantive,\n\n01:25.800 --> 01:28.080\n but it's more in like a via negativa mode.\n\n01:28.080 --> 01:29.360\n It's more like what God is not,\n\n01:29.360 --> 01:31.600\n because there's nothing in the world\n\n01:31.600 --> 01:33.860\n that would correspond to those descriptions.\n\n01:33.860 --> 01:36.840\n So anything in the world would be a being of some type\n\n01:36.840 --> 01:38.640\n or an event of some type,\n\n01:38.640 --> 01:41.240\n some particular mode of existence.\n\n01:41.240 --> 01:45.040\n And God is not an entity in the world.\n\n01:45.040 --> 01:46.800\n I would say that's the fundamental mistake\n\n01:46.800 --> 01:49.480\n that atheists old and new make all the time,\n\n01:49.480 --> 01:53.080\n is they think of God as a big being.\n\n01:53.080 --> 01:57.480\n When Aquinas says that God is not in any genus,\n\n01:57.480 --> 01:59.160\n even the genus of being,\n\n01:59.160 --> 02:01.280\n it's one of the strangest remarks in the whole tradition,\n\n02:01.280 --> 02:02.620\n but it's really interesting.\n\n02:02.620 --> 02:03.860\n So you say, well, at the very least,\n\n02:03.860 --> 02:05.180\n God must be a being, right?\n\n02:05.180 --> 02:09.080\n And Aquinas's answer is no, he's not in the genus of being.\n\n02:09.080 --> 02:12.480\n So we talk about God being beyond being and so on.\n\n02:12.480 --> 02:15.320\n To say in God essence and existence coincide\n\n02:15.320 --> 02:18.480\n is to say God's very nature is to be,\n\n02:18.480 --> 02:21.720\n and that can't be true of any contingent thing in the world.\n\n02:21.720 --> 02:23.660\n So what I'm doing there is I'm gesturing\n\n02:23.660 --> 02:26.120\n the way the tradition does toward God,\n\n02:26.120 --> 02:29.340\n using language that's at the same time\n\n02:29.340 --> 02:32.320\n philosophically precise and gnomic.\n\n02:32.320 --> 02:34.400\n It's both accurate, it's true.\n\n02:34.400 --> 02:36.700\n God, essence and existence coincide.\n\n02:36.700 --> 02:40.800\n What God is is the same as God's active to be.\n\n02:40.800 --> 02:42.280\n But now what does that mean?\n\n02:42.280 --> 02:43.120\n I'm not quite sure,\n\n02:43.120 --> 02:45.200\n because nothing in our ordinary experience\n\n02:45.200 --> 02:46.800\n corresponds to that.\n\n02:46.800 --> 02:50.280\n Everything in our experience is a being of some type.\n\n02:50.280 --> 02:53.660\n So it's existence received according to the mode\n\n02:53.660 --> 02:55.240\n of some essence.\n\n02:56.200 --> 02:57.420\n That's not true of God,\n\n02:58.440 --> 03:00.180\n which is why he can't be found in the world.\n\n03:00.180 --> 03:04.200\n And that's, as I say, the fundamental mistake is,\n\n03:04.200 --> 03:05.780\n oh, I guess theists are those that believe\n\n03:05.780 --> 03:08.600\n there's this being alongside the other beings\n\n03:08.600 --> 03:09.440\n in the universe.\n\n03:09.440 --> 03:12.320\n And then atheists say, oh no, there is no such being.\n\n03:12.320 --> 03:13.800\n And that's precisely wrong.\n\n03:13.800 --> 03:15.240\n That's just a category error.\n\n03:16.760 --> 03:20.260\n Dawkins, I think, cites Bertrand Russell.\n\n03:20.260 --> 03:22.760\n To the effect that proving the nonexistence of God\n\n03:22.760 --> 03:26.160\n is a bit like proving the nonexistence of a China teapot\n\n03:26.160 --> 03:28.640\n orbiting between Earth and Mars.\n\n03:28.640 --> 03:31.480\n No, that's precisely what God is not,\n\n03:31.480 --> 03:34.080\n some entity that's sort of hidden\n\n03:34.080 --> 03:36.920\n among the other entities of the universe.\n\n03:36.920 --> 03:41.140\n God is the reason why there's a contingent realm at all,\n\n03:41.140 --> 03:42.560\n is the way to put it.\n\n03:42.560 --> 03:43.820\n In more theological language,\n\n03:43.820 --> 03:45.840\n God's the creator of all things.\n\n03:45.840 --> 03:48.880\n So if God is outside of our world,\n\n03:48.880 --> 03:51.600\n is it possible for us to visualize,\n\n03:51.600 --> 03:54.420\n to comprehend, to know God?\n\n03:54.420 --> 03:55.780\n Not utterly, of course.\n\n03:55.780 --> 03:58.800\n And I would say our knowledge begins always in this world,\n\n03:58.800 --> 04:00.420\n begins in ordinary experience.\n\n04:00.420 --> 04:03.160\n But I think we can, through metaphysical analysis,\n\n04:03.160 --> 04:05.100\n through philosophical reasoning,\n\n04:05.100 --> 04:08.340\n can come to some knowledge of a reality\n\n04:08.340 --> 04:10.560\n which is transcendent to our experience.\n\n04:10.560 --> 04:12.580\n So we gesture toward it.\n\n04:12.580 --> 04:15.160\n I always like Aquinas who says the language about God\n\n04:15.160 --> 04:17.120\n that we use is analogical.\n\n04:17.120 --> 04:21.360\n So it's not univocal, meaning what I say about that can\n\n04:21.360 --> 04:23.560\n or about this bottle, I can say about God.\n\n04:23.560 --> 04:25.520\n No, that makes God an entity.\n\n04:25.520 --> 04:28.380\n At the same time, it's not simply equivocal.\n\n04:28.380 --> 04:31.560\n So if I say, well, that thing is and God is,\n\n04:31.560 --> 04:33.380\n I mean totally different things.\n\n04:33.380 --> 04:36.000\n No, no, I mean something analogous.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.260\n So to be God is to be, to be.\n\n04:38.260 --> 04:42.100\n So the real meaning of being is the being of God.\n\n04:42.100 --> 04:44.380\n The being of that thing or this thing,\n\n04:44.380 --> 04:47.660\n or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles\n\n04:47.660 --> 04:50.600\n would be analogous to God's manner of being.\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:53.440\n So on that basis, I can make some statements.\n\n04:53.440 --> 04:56.280\n I can, I can theorize.\n\n04:56.280 --> 04:59.320\n And even at the limit, as you suggest, I can visualize.\n\n04:59.320 --> 05:01.200\n So we have metaphors for God,\n\n05:01.200 --> 05:04.280\n and the Bible is replete with those, right?\n\n05:04.280 --> 05:06.200\n So God is a rock.\n\n05:06.200 --> 05:07.460\n You know, God's like a lion.\n\n05:07.460 --> 05:08.720\n God's like this and that.\n\n05:08.720 --> 05:11.200\n Or the Bible will sometimes imagine God\n\n05:11.200 --> 05:14.020\n as a human being walking around, you know.\n\n05:14.020 --> 05:15.960\n Now, only the crudest fundamentalism would say,\n\n05:15.960 --> 05:20.160\n well, that's a univocal, accurate description of God.\n\n05:20.160 --> 05:22.440\n It's an image that's catching something\n\n05:22.440 --> 05:23.900\n of God's manner of being.\n\n05:25.200 --> 05:30.200\n Then what does it mean to believe in God?\n\n05:31.260 --> 05:34.460\n So there's a word, and we have to limit ourselves\n\n05:34.460 --> 05:37.300\n to human interpretable words today.\n\n05:37.300 --> 05:39.420\n There's a word called faith.\n\n05:39.420 --> 05:40.940\n What does faith mean?\n\n05:40.940 --> 05:44.760\n So if we can't really directly know God,\n\n05:45.660 --> 05:50.060\n you kind of sneak up to the idea of God with metaphors.\n\n05:50.060 --> 05:51.960\n Better he sneaks up on us.\n\n05:51.960 --> 05:53.760\n Because I like the language of grace.\n\n05:53.760 --> 05:55.880\n God's action comes first.\n\n05:55.880 --> 06:00.540\n So if I stay perfectly within the realm of I'm seeking\n\n06:00.540 --> 06:04.660\n with my kind of eagle eyes and my inquiring mind,\n\n06:04.660 --> 06:06.160\n I'm not gonna find God that way.\n\n06:06.160 --> 06:09.740\n I might find a path that opens up.\n\n06:09.740 --> 06:12.140\n But I would say finally God finds me,\n\n06:12.140 --> 06:14.020\n and I think then the language of faith\n\n06:14.020 --> 06:15.280\n begins to make more sense.\n\n06:16.460 --> 06:18.860\n I'm with Paul Tillich, though, the Protestant theologian,\n\n06:18.860 --> 06:20.660\n said the most misunderstood word\n\n06:20.660 --> 06:22.900\n in the religious vocabulary is faith.\n\n06:22.900 --> 06:24.880\n Because he said the way we take it usually\n\n06:24.880 --> 06:26.780\n is something subrational.\n\n06:26.780 --> 06:29.320\n You know, I have proof of this.\n\n06:29.320 --> 06:32.340\n I really know this, and I only kind of believe that.\n\n06:32.340 --> 06:35.920\n Like, that's just a personal opinion or impression.\n\n06:35.920 --> 06:40.220\n But that's to identify faith with the kind of infrarational.\n\n06:40.220 --> 06:41.780\n And that's not it.\n\n06:41.780 --> 06:43.540\n I mean, I don't want something infrarational.\n\n06:43.540 --> 06:47.340\n I don't want superstition or childish credulity.\n\n06:47.340 --> 06:51.540\n So authentic faith is the darkness beyond reason\n\n06:51.540 --> 06:52.900\n and on the far side of reason.\n\n06:52.900 --> 06:55.860\n It's super irrational, not infrarational.\n\n06:55.860 --> 06:58.100\n And that's a very important move.\n\n06:58.100 --> 06:59.980\n At the limit of what I can know,\n\n06:59.980 --> 07:02.540\n at the limit of my striving and my vision,\n\n07:02.540 --> 07:04.940\n there's this horizon that opens up.\n\n07:04.940 --> 07:08.140\n And I think that's true even in ordinary ways of knowing.\n\n07:08.140 --> 07:09.300\n There's a kind of a horizon\n\n07:09.300 --> 07:11.620\n that lures us beyond what I've got.\n\n07:11.620 --> 07:14.380\n Faith has to do more with that kind of darkness\n\n07:14.380 --> 07:16.960\n rather than a darkness prior to reason.\n\n07:18.060 --> 07:22.000\n The darkness beyond the horizon prior to reason,\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:24.420\n first of all, the poetry of your language is incredible.\n\n07:24.420 --> 07:27.260\n To be, to be, I have a million questions.\n\n07:27.260 --> 07:28.540\n Yeah, go ahead.\n\n07:28.540 --> 07:30.180\n I do too on this.\n\n07:30.180 --> 07:32.420\n So first of all, let me just jump around.\n\n07:32.420 --> 07:34.800\n You mentioned to be, to be a few times.\n\n07:34.800 --> 07:36.340\n What does that mean?\n\n07:36.340 --> 07:39.660\n Well, to be me is to be a human being, right?\n\n07:39.660 --> 07:40.800\n To be this is to be a table,\n\n07:40.800 --> 07:41.700\n to be this is to be a microphone.\n\n07:41.700 --> 07:44.000\n So it's, I'll use Aquinas's language.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.440\n It's the act of being poured, if you want,\n\n07:47.440 --> 07:50.180\n into the receptacle of some essential principle.\n\n07:50.180 --> 07:52.420\n So it's got an ontological structure.\n\n07:52.420 --> 07:56.660\n It's an existent, it's a thing that exists,\n\n07:56.660 --> 07:59.340\n but it's existing in a limited way\n\n07:59.340 --> 08:01.140\n according to an essential principle.\n\n08:01.140 --> 08:04.940\n So God, so what's God?\n\n08:04.940 --> 08:05.760\n What's God's name?\n\n08:05.760 --> 08:06.900\n What kind of being is he?\n\n08:07.940 --> 08:09.640\n We'll go back to Moses now.\n\n08:10.640 --> 08:13.140\n When the Israelites asked me, you know, what's your name?\n\n08:13.140 --> 08:14.220\n What should I tell them?\n\n08:14.220 --> 08:17.160\n And he says, you know, famously, I am who I am.\n\n08:17.160 --> 08:20.660\n But see, Aquinas reads that as a very accurate remark.\n\n08:20.660 --> 08:24.080\n So Moses is wondering, okay, there's a lot of gods\n\n08:24.080 --> 08:25.740\n and there's a lot of things, a lot of entities.\n\n08:25.740 --> 08:26.580\n Well, which one are you?\n\n08:26.580 --> 08:27.500\n You gotta be one of them.\n\n08:27.500 --> 08:29.260\n So tell me your name.\n\n08:29.260 --> 08:31.260\n In philosophical language, give me the essence\n\n08:31.260 --> 08:34.440\n that receives your act of existing, right?\n\n08:34.440 --> 08:37.300\n And God's answer blows the mind of Moses\n\n08:37.300 --> 08:38.140\n and the whole tradition.\n\n08:38.140 --> 08:40.000\n I am who I am.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:41.820\n To be God is to be.\n\n08:43.380 --> 08:44.520\n So I'm not this or that.\n\n08:44.520 --> 08:45.360\n I'm not up or down.\n\n08:45.360 --> 08:46.700\n I'm not here or there.\n\n08:46.700 --> 08:48.420\n God is that whose center is everywhere\n\n08:48.420 --> 08:51.640\n and whose circumference is nowhere, as the mystics put it.\n\n08:51.640 --> 08:54.500\n Now, can I get a clear and distinct idea of that?\n\n08:54.500 --> 08:56.780\n No, and in a way, that's the whole point.\n\n08:56.780 --> 09:00.100\n If I could, I'd be talking about a being of some kind.\n\n09:00.100 --> 09:01.200\n So to be God is to be.\n\n09:01.200 --> 09:03.260\n To be is to, and that's, you know,\n\n09:03.260 --> 09:06.060\n Moses, take off your sandals, you're on holy ground.\n\n09:06.060 --> 09:07.340\n So I'm gonna go over confidently\n\n09:07.340 --> 09:09.780\n and find out what this thing is, this burning bush.\n\n09:09.780 --> 09:11.480\n I'm gonna find out.\n\n09:11.480 --> 09:12.900\n No, no, no.\n\n09:12.900 --> 09:14.500\n Take off your shoes, you're on holy ground\n\n09:14.500 --> 09:16.340\n because you're not in charge here.\n\n09:16.340 --> 09:17.660\n You're not in command.\n\n09:17.660 --> 09:19.940\n Because if you've got shoes on,\n\n09:19.940 --> 09:21.180\n you can walk wherever you want.\n\n09:21.180 --> 09:22.500\n You can walk with confidence.\n\n09:22.500 --> 09:26.380\n But you take your shoes off, you're much more vulnerable.\n\n09:26.380 --> 09:29.580\n And that's appropriate when you're talking about God.\n\n09:29.580 --> 09:30.740\n But here's another interesting thing.\n\n09:30.740 --> 09:31.940\n I didn't think about the burning bush\n\n09:31.940 --> 09:33.580\n in this connection before,\n\n09:33.580 --> 09:37.760\n but it's a bush that's on fire but not consumed.\n\n09:39.060 --> 09:41.500\n Beings are competitive with each other.\n\n09:41.500 --> 09:43.940\n And so these can't be in the same place at the same time,\n\n09:43.940 --> 09:44.900\n these two beings.\n\n09:44.900 --> 09:46.860\n They're mutually exclusive if you want.\n\n09:48.740 --> 09:52.820\n But as God comes close to a creature,\n\n09:52.820 --> 09:55.780\n he doesn't destroy it or consume it.\n\n09:55.780 --> 09:57.620\n But the creature becomes more beautiful\n\n09:57.620 --> 09:59.700\n and more radiant, right?\n\n09:59.700 --> 10:03.080\n And see, compare it to the classical gods and goddesses.\n\n10:03.080 --> 10:06.580\n When they come bursting into life and experience,\n\n10:06.580 --> 10:09.140\n things are incinerated and people give way\n\n10:09.140 --> 10:10.700\n and they're overwhelmed.\n\n10:10.700 --> 10:13.660\n Then there's this biblical idea of God comes close\n\n10:13.660 --> 10:17.060\n and sets things on fire but doesn't burn them up.\n\n10:17.060 --> 10:19.140\n And that's because he's not a competitive being\n\n10:19.140 --> 10:20.140\n in the world.\n\n10:20.140 --> 10:25.140\n If he were a big being, then he'd be competing for space,\n\n10:25.140 --> 10:27.980\n so to speak, on the same ontological grid.\n\n10:27.980 --> 10:29.180\n But he's not like that.\n\n10:30.180 --> 10:35.140\n So God can come close and we come more fully alive.\n\n10:35.140 --> 10:37.240\n Now we're starting to gesture toward the incarnation,\n\n10:37.240 --> 10:38.820\n I mean, the central Christian doctrine,\n\n10:38.820 --> 10:42.340\n that God can actually become a human\n\n10:42.340 --> 10:45.980\n without overwhelming the human he becomes, right?\n\n10:45.980 --> 10:47.980\n So I mean, that's kind of the next step.\n\n10:47.980 --> 10:51.740\n But the basic idea of God is noncompetitively\n\n10:51.740 --> 10:53.340\n transcendent to the world.\n\n10:53.340 --> 10:54.900\n That's another way to get at it.\n\n10:54.900 --> 10:57.940\n Noncompetitively transcendent to the world\n\n10:57.940 --> 11:01.780\n so as beyond being as the source of being.\n\n11:01.780 --> 11:03.020\n Right.\n\n11:03.020 --> 11:06.100\n Let me make it maybe more imagistic.\n\n11:06.100 --> 11:10.300\n I think a really good analogy would be author to book.\n\n11:10.300 --> 11:13.160\n Right, so like Tolkien or someone that writes\n\n11:13.160 --> 11:16.260\n one of these big sprawling novels.\n\n11:16.260 --> 11:18.580\n And Tolkien's good too because he creates a whole world.\n\n11:18.580 --> 11:21.180\n He creates a new nature, a new language, new history,\n\n11:21.180 --> 11:23.320\n all that, think of the thousands of characters\n\n11:23.320 --> 11:25.380\n and the plots and subplots and all of it.\n\n11:26.300 --> 11:28.620\n Tolkien is utterly responsible\n\n11:28.620 --> 11:31.540\n for every bit of that story, right?\n\n11:31.540 --> 11:34.180\n Every character, every plot, every subplot,\n\n11:34.180 --> 11:36.780\n every description, he's completely responsible.\n\n11:36.780 --> 11:39.580\n He's involved in every nook and cranny of it.\n\n11:39.580 --> 11:43.140\n But he's not in the story, he's not in the book.\n\n11:43.140 --> 11:45.760\n You're not gonna find him as a character in the book.\n\n11:45.760 --> 11:48.460\n So that's the category mistake of the atheist in a way\n\n11:48.460 --> 11:50.540\n is I'm looking for God, he's a character\n\n11:50.540 --> 11:51.900\n in this story somewhere.\n\n11:51.900 --> 11:54.620\n No, he's the author of the story.\n\n11:54.620 --> 11:58.540\n Mysteriously present to every aspect of the story,\n\n11:58.540 --> 12:00.780\n but not a character in it.\n\n12:00.780 --> 12:03.940\n Right, he is deeply in the story somehow.\n\n12:03.940 --> 12:04.820\n Right. He's present,\n\n12:04.820 --> 12:08.700\n but he's not, even if he is a character,\n\n12:08.700 --> 12:13.100\n he's not really, the full embodiment is not a character.\n\n12:13.100 --> 12:16.460\n And people inside the book\n\n12:16.460 --> 12:18.500\n can't really know about the author.\n\n12:18.500 --> 12:19.780\n Right.\n\n12:19.780 --> 12:22.300\n No, right. Well, see, Augustine says,\n\n12:22.300 --> 12:25.340\n God is simultaneously intime or intimo meo\n\n12:25.340 --> 12:26.860\n et superior sumo meo.\n\n12:26.860 --> 12:30.300\n He's closer to me than I am to myself,\n\n12:30.300 --> 12:33.340\n and he's higher than anything I could possibly imagine\n\n12:33.340 --> 12:34.380\n at the same time.\n\n12:34.380 --> 12:36.460\n But see, once you get the insight\n\n12:36.460 --> 12:38.940\n that God is the sheer act of to be,\n\n12:38.940 --> 12:40.260\n well, of course that's true.\n\n12:40.260 --> 12:45.260\n So right now, God is sustaining us in existence.\n\n12:45.780 --> 12:46.940\n True.\n\n12:46.940 --> 12:50.140\n Aquinas says, God is in all things by essence,\n\n12:50.140 --> 12:53.460\n presence, and power, and most intimately so.\n\n12:53.460 --> 12:56.780\n And he's nowhere in this room.\n\n12:56.780 --> 12:58.140\n Okay, well, where's God?\n\n12:58.140 --> 12:59.700\n He's nowhere in this room.\n\n12:59.700 --> 13:02.100\n He's totaliter aliter, we say.\n\n13:02.100 --> 13:03.940\n He's totally other.\n\n13:03.940 --> 13:05.020\n Same time.\n\n13:05.020 --> 13:06.840\n But once you crack that code, though,\n\n13:06.840 --> 13:09.500\n I think you see it of why that would be true.\n\n13:09.500 --> 13:12.180\n And see, now I'm getting from more philosophical language\n\n13:12.180 --> 13:13.260\n to more mystical language,\n\n13:13.260 --> 13:15.220\n because all the mystics talk that way\n\n13:15.220 --> 13:18.740\n in these high paradoxes about God's availability\n\n13:18.740 --> 13:20.660\n and unavailability.\n\n13:20.660 --> 13:24.220\n I've often thought in the Bible, story after story,\n\n13:24.220 --> 13:28.440\n God can neither be grasped nor hidden from.\n\n13:30.060 --> 13:32.940\n So the first sinful instinct is to grasp at God.\n\n13:32.940 --> 13:36.340\n I've got him, I understand him, I can manipulate him.\n\n13:36.340 --> 13:37.180\n No, no, no.\n\n13:37.180 --> 13:39.700\n Story after story is told, you can't do that.\n\n13:39.700 --> 13:41.420\n Well, then the other extreme of the sinner,\n\n13:41.420 --> 13:43.480\n all right, then I'm gonna run from God.\n\n13:43.480 --> 13:45.680\n I'm gonna avoid God.\n\n13:45.680 --> 13:50.020\n Jonah and the whale, so he has the call from God,\n\n13:50.020 --> 13:51.780\n and he said, no, no, I'm gonna refuse that.\n\n13:51.780 --> 13:53.380\n I'm gonna run as far away.\n\n13:53.380 --> 13:55.940\n I'm gonna go to Tarshish, which meant Timbuktu for them,\n\n13:55.940 --> 13:57.140\n at the end of the world.\n\n13:58.260 --> 13:59.900\n God's got the whale, swallows him up,\n\n13:59.900 --> 14:01.860\n and brings him right back where God wants him.\n\n14:01.860 --> 14:03.580\n It's a poetic way of saying\n\n14:03.580 --> 14:05.880\n you can't escape the press of God.\n\n14:05.880 --> 14:07.500\n At the same time, Tower of Babel.\n\n14:07.500 --> 14:09.020\n I'm gonna build a tower up to God.\n\n14:09.020 --> 14:11.140\n I'm gonna grab hold of God.\n\n14:11.140 --> 14:12.900\n No, no, no, you can't do that.\n\n14:12.900 --> 14:15.420\n So, live in the space in between those two things,\n\n14:15.420 --> 14:18.180\n which would be the space of friendship with God,\n\n14:19.380 --> 14:20.740\n falling in love with God\n\n14:20.740 --> 14:22.880\n is neither grasping nor hiding from God.\n\n14:25.260 --> 14:28.700\n You mentioned, again, a lot of beautiful poetic things.\n\n14:28.700 --> 14:30.380\n You mentioned grace.\n\n14:30.380 --> 14:31.220\n Yeah.\n\n14:31.220 --> 14:32.320\n You mentioned sin.\n\n14:32.320 --> 14:34.220\n You mentioned incarnation.\n\n14:35.140 --> 14:37.540\n Is there a philosophical, pragmatic way\n\n14:37.540 --> 14:40.740\n to start talking about the pillars of Christianity?\n\n14:40.740 --> 14:45.740\n What are the defining things that make Christianity to you,\n\n14:46.100 --> 14:51.100\n and broadly speaking, to those that follow the religion?\n\n14:51.660 --> 14:53.340\n In a way, what we're doing so far\n\n14:53.340 --> 14:55.160\n is a necessary propaedeutic,\n\n14:55.160 --> 14:56.900\n because we're talking about God.\n\n14:58.300 --> 15:00.100\n What makes Christianity distinctive, of course,\n\n15:00.100 --> 15:01.860\n is the claim of the incarnation.\n\n15:01.860 --> 15:03.380\n So, we come up out of Judaism.\n\n15:03.380 --> 15:06.140\n We come up out of this great monotheistic tradition.\n\n15:06.140 --> 15:09.100\n And the Bible itself and all the great commentaries\n\n15:09.100 --> 15:11.380\n within Judaism, I think, would agree\n\n15:11.380 --> 15:15.500\n with this basic theistic stuff that I've been talking about.\n\n15:15.500 --> 15:17.440\n Take Moses Maimonides, for example.\n\n15:18.420 --> 15:20.900\n Now, what makes Christianity distinct,\n\n15:20.900 --> 15:25.820\n this supremely weird claim that God becomes one of us,\n\n15:25.820 --> 15:30.540\n God becomes a creature, but without ceasing to be God\n\n15:30.540 --> 15:32.020\n and without overwhelming the integrity\n\n15:32.020 --> 15:33.540\n of the creature he becomes.\n\n15:33.540 --> 15:35.300\n What we see in the burning bush,\n\n15:35.300 --> 15:37.940\n that principle which obtains across the board,\n\n15:37.940 --> 15:39.440\n so the closer God comes to me,\n\n15:39.440 --> 15:42.140\n the more radiant I become, right?\n\n15:42.140 --> 15:44.620\n But take that now to the nth degree,\n\n15:44.620 --> 15:46.340\n would be what we mean by the incarnation,\n\n15:46.340 --> 15:51.340\n the incarnation of the Son of God becoming a creature\n\n15:51.460 --> 15:56.260\n in such a way as to make humanity radiant and beautiful.\n\n15:57.340 --> 15:58.860\n That's the pillar of Christianity.\n\n15:58.860 --> 16:00.340\n It's the incarnation.\n\n16:01.780 --> 16:03.820\n And what follows from that is the redemption\n\n16:03.820 --> 16:07.540\n of all of reality, so not just of human beings,\n\n16:07.540 --> 16:12.540\n but in becoming a creature, God divinizes the world.\n\n16:14.460 --> 16:17.540\n The Greek fathers always said God became human,\n\n16:17.540 --> 16:19.460\n that humans might become God.\n\n16:19.460 --> 16:21.500\n And that's a good way to sum up, I think,\n\n16:21.500 --> 16:23.220\n the essence of Christianity.\n\n16:23.220 --> 16:25.060\n Why is this such an important thing?\n\n16:25.060 --> 16:26.820\n So it's a distinctive thing,\n\n16:26.820 --> 16:30.020\n but why is it so important philosophically\n\n16:30.020 --> 16:32.020\n to what it means to be a Christian?\n\n16:34.140 --> 16:36.980\n What impact did that have on our world,\n\n16:36.980 --> 16:39.460\n on human civilization, on human nature,\n\n16:39.460 --> 16:43.300\n on our morals of why live, what to live for,\n\n16:43.300 --> 16:44.500\n and the meaning of it all?\n\n16:44.500 --> 16:46.460\n Why is incarnation so important?\n\n16:46.460 --> 16:48.060\n Well, I think it's massively important\n\n16:48.060 --> 16:49.900\n because it's the divinization principle\n\n16:49.900 --> 16:52.300\n that God wants to divinize his creation\n\n16:52.300 --> 16:54.580\n and sort of in this concentrated point\n\n16:54.580 --> 16:56.220\n of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n16:56.220 --> 16:58.500\n But then we talk about the mystical body of Jesus,\n\n16:58.500 --> 17:00.220\n so that goes right back to Paul.\n\n17:00.220 --> 17:02.180\n As we're grafted onto Christ,\n\n17:02.180 --> 17:04.380\n we talk about that as the church,\n\n17:04.380 --> 17:08.420\n we become like cells and molecules in an organism.\n\n17:08.420 --> 17:10.460\n That's the church, it's not an organization,\n\n17:10.460 --> 17:13.980\n that's a deformation of ecclesiology.\n\n17:13.980 --> 17:17.060\n The church is this organism that begins with Jesus\n\n17:17.060 --> 17:20.780\n and then he's drawing all of humanity,\n\n17:20.780 --> 17:23.180\n but ultimately all of nature,\n\n17:23.180 --> 17:26.380\n all of creation to himself.\n\n17:26.380 --> 17:27.580\n When the Son of Man is lifted up,\n\n17:27.580 --> 17:29.420\n he will draw all things to himself,\n\n17:29.420 --> 17:34.420\n that idea of the gathering in of a scattered creation.\n\n17:34.420 --> 17:36.340\n So in that way, it's at the heart of it.\n\n17:36.340 --> 17:37.820\n Then there's all kinds of things.\n\n17:37.820 --> 17:39.660\n If God becomes human,\n\n17:39.660 --> 17:41.420\n that means there's a dignity to humanity,\n\n17:41.420 --> 17:43.900\n which goes beyond anything any humanist\n\n17:43.900 --> 17:46.420\n of any stripe has ever said, right?\n\n17:46.420 --> 17:49.180\n Ancient, medieval, modern, contemporary.\n\n17:50.180 --> 17:53.020\n Christianity is the greatest humanism imaginable.\n\n17:53.020 --> 17:56.740\n God became one of us in order to divinize us.\n\n17:56.740 --> 17:59.420\n The goal of my life is not just to be a good person,\n\n17:59.420 --> 18:02.700\n not just to be materially successful,\n\n18:02.700 --> 18:05.420\n not just to be a member of society.\n\n18:05.420 --> 18:07.460\n The goal of my life is to become\n\n18:07.460 --> 18:09.380\n a participant in the divine nature.\n\n18:09.380 --> 18:12.260\n And so I don't think there is a humanism greater than that,\n\n18:12.260 --> 18:13.940\n even conceivably.\n\n18:13.940 --> 18:16.620\n So that's where I think humanism\n\n18:16.620 --> 18:19.340\n is profoundly influenced by the incarnation.\n\n18:20.380 --> 18:25.140\n And just our notion of God is noncompetitive to us.\n\n18:25.140 --> 18:27.580\n And it's so important, because I think in so many systems\n\n18:27.580 --> 18:29.460\n from mythology onward,\n\n18:29.460 --> 18:31.900\n you have these competitive understandings of God.\n\n18:32.780 --> 18:35.660\n When Jesus says to his disciples the night before he dies,\n\n18:35.660 --> 18:38.180\n I no longer call you servants but friends,\n\n18:38.180 --> 18:40.260\n it's an extraordinary moment.\n\n18:40.260 --> 18:43.620\n Because every God who's ever been served,\n\n18:43.620 --> 18:45.580\n well, that's the best we can hope for\n\n18:45.580 --> 18:48.020\n is that we'll be as the servant of God.\n\n18:48.020 --> 18:50.220\n You know, I'll try to obey you, Lord.\n\n18:50.220 --> 18:51.540\n I'll try to do what you want.\n\n18:51.540 --> 18:54.860\n But when Jesus says, I no longer call you servants\n\n18:54.860 --> 18:58.300\n or slaves, he would have said in the Greek there, you know.\n\n18:58.300 --> 19:01.420\n But friends, I don't know,\n\n19:01.420 --> 19:03.380\n I can't imagine anything greater than that,\n\n19:03.380 --> 19:04.860\n becoming God's friend.\n\n19:04.860 --> 19:08.620\n That's a call to become one with God.\n\n19:08.620 --> 19:12.140\n It's possible to become one with God.\n\n19:12.140 --> 19:13.460\n Now I should mention,\n\n19:13.460 --> 19:15.920\n you're one of the greatest religious communicators\n\n19:15.920 --> 19:17.580\n I've ever experienced.\n\n19:17.580 --> 19:19.900\n A huge number of people are fans of yours.\n\n19:19.900 --> 19:23.300\n You've done a lot of great conversations.\n\n19:23.300 --> 19:25.140\n You've done Reddit AMAs,\n\n19:25.140 --> 19:29.800\n which is a very unique, bold, brave thing.\n\n19:29.800 --> 19:32.900\n And on one of them, somebody asked,\n\n19:34.080 --> 19:37.140\n what's the most challenging of the seven deadly sins?\n\n19:37.140 --> 19:41.060\n So first, what are the seven deadly sins?\n\n19:41.060 --> 19:43.660\n What do they have to do with Christianity?\n\n19:43.660 --> 19:47.820\n How essential, how crucial they are to the religion?\n\n19:47.820 --> 19:51.580\n And what's the most challenging in our modern day?\n\n19:51.580 --> 19:55.900\n Yeah, to name them, pride, envy, anger,\n\n19:55.900 --> 19:59.340\n sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust\n\n19:59.340 --> 20:01.220\n are the seven deadly sins.\n\n20:01.220 --> 20:03.460\n We're called capital sins sometimes,\n\n20:03.460 --> 20:07.380\n they're the head sins from which things tend to flow.\n\n20:07.380 --> 20:09.780\n The most fundamental is pride.\n\n20:11.380 --> 20:13.420\n Probably most people today, if you talk about like vice,\n\n20:13.420 --> 20:15.300\n or you talk about a deadly sin,\n\n20:15.300 --> 20:16.820\n they would think about lust.\n\n20:16.820 --> 20:19.020\n But the classical authors, including Dante,\n\n20:19.020 --> 20:21.540\n who does this pictorially,\n\n20:21.540 --> 20:23.740\n that's the least of the deadly sins is lust,\n\n20:23.740 --> 20:25.980\n because it's the one that's most sort of dependent\n\n20:25.980 --> 20:29.180\n upon the body and its passions and so on.\n\n20:29.180 --> 20:30.660\n The most important is pride.\n\n20:30.660 --> 20:33.040\n Pride is the deadliest of deadly sins.\n\n20:33.040 --> 20:34.980\n And it's very simple to see why.\n\n20:34.980 --> 20:38.380\n Pride is, Augustine calls it incurvatus in se.\n\n20:38.380 --> 20:40.940\n I'm caved in around myself.\n\n20:40.940 --> 20:44.340\n Like a black hole, right, to get into the scientific.\n\n20:44.340 --> 20:46.660\n But the black hole to me is a great symbol,\n\n20:46.660 --> 20:48.880\n you know, that it's so heavy\n\n20:48.880 --> 20:50.780\n that it draws everything, including light.\n\n20:50.780 --> 20:52.740\n Nothing can escape from it.\n\n20:52.740 --> 20:54.140\n See, that's the sinner.\n\n20:54.140 --> 20:55.740\n We're all sinners.\n\n20:55.740 --> 20:56.800\n We're like black holes,\n\n20:56.800 --> 20:59.360\n that we draw everything into ourselves.\n\n21:00.360 --> 21:04.820\n So as a sinner, and I'll confess I'm a sinner,\n\n21:04.820 --> 21:08.280\n the temptation is, okay, this is the Bishop Barron moment,\n\n21:08.280 --> 21:12.420\n and I'm drawing you now into my world and so on.\n\n21:13.920 --> 21:16.500\n What that does is it kills us off,\n\n21:16.500 --> 21:20.520\n and it darkens life, and it makes it small,\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:23.460\n and heavy, and awful, right?\n\n21:23.460 --> 21:28.380\n It's like, but see, compared to the contrasting thing,\n\n21:28.380 --> 21:31.420\n is when you're lost in a moment,\n\n21:31.420 --> 21:33.840\n you're not concerned about the impression I'm making.\n\n21:33.840 --> 21:35.960\n You're not concerned about drawing the world into yourself.\n\n21:35.960 --> 21:38.260\n You're not concerned about this monkey on my back\n\n21:38.260 --> 21:39.640\n that's always telling me, you know,\n\n21:39.640 --> 21:41.660\n look good and sound right.\n\n21:41.660 --> 21:44.140\n But you're lost in something.\n\n21:44.140 --> 21:46.360\n You're just talking, you know, to a friend,\n\n21:46.360 --> 21:47.620\n and the two of you together\n\n21:47.620 --> 21:50.300\n are discovering something true or beautiful.\n\n21:50.300 --> 21:53.040\n You're lost in a movie, or you're lost in a book.\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:54.880\n Those are the best moments in life.\n\n21:54.880 --> 21:55.720\n Those are the best,\n\n21:55.720 --> 21:58.420\n because they're the least prideful moments, right?\n\n21:58.420 --> 22:00.700\n That's when the light comes out.\n\n22:00.700 --> 22:05.380\n I become radiant, because I'm overcoming this tendency\n\n22:05.380 --> 22:06.620\n to fall in on myself.\n\n22:08.300 --> 22:12.780\n Dante is so good, because the way he pictures Satan\n\n22:12.780 --> 22:14.260\n in Divine Comedy, and you know,\n\n22:14.260 --> 22:15.700\n he's at the center of the Earth.\n\n22:15.700 --> 22:17.220\n So like a black hole that way,\n\n22:17.220 --> 22:19.020\n like he's at the center of gravity.\n\n22:19.020 --> 22:21.060\n He's at the heaviest place.\n\n22:21.060 --> 22:23.980\n And there's not fire where he is, but ice,\n\n22:23.980 --> 22:26.220\n which is a much, much better image,\n\n22:26.220 --> 22:29.100\n that you're frozen in place, and you're stuck.\n\n22:29.100 --> 22:31.460\n And he's got wings, right?\n\n22:31.460 --> 22:33.720\n And they used to be angel wings, because he's an angel,\n\n22:33.720 --> 22:35.500\n but now they're like bat wings for Dante,\n\n22:35.500 --> 22:37.440\n and they're flapping.\n\n22:37.440 --> 22:40.540\n And all they're doing is making the world around him colder,\n\n22:40.540 --> 22:43.320\n because he's ice, he's stuck in his own iciness,\n\n22:43.320 --> 22:45.660\n and then he's beating his wings over the ice,\n\n22:45.660 --> 22:46.940\n making everyone else colder.\n\n22:46.940 --> 22:48.860\n It's a great image.\n\n22:48.860 --> 22:50.300\n And then he has, this is cool too,\n\n22:50.300 --> 22:53.060\n he has three faces, Satan,\n\n22:53.060 --> 22:55.140\n because he's the simulacrum of the Trinity.\n\n22:55.140 --> 22:57.140\n So every sinner thinks he's God.\n\n22:57.140 --> 22:58.500\n So I pretend I'm God.\n\n22:58.500 --> 23:00.380\n So he's got the three faces.\n\n23:00.380 --> 23:02.440\n And from all six eyes, he weeps.\n\n23:03.780 --> 23:07.220\n Also from all three mouths, he's chewing a sinner.\n\n23:07.220 --> 23:11.280\n He's got Cassius, Brutus, and Judas in the three mouths,\n\n23:11.280 --> 23:13.020\n you know, the three traitors.\n\n23:13.020 --> 23:16.420\n But I thought, it's just a great image\n\n23:16.420 --> 23:19.480\n of all of us sinners, is we're stuck,\n\n23:19.480 --> 23:22.220\n it's heavy, it's cold,\n\n23:22.220 --> 23:25.060\n we're chewing on our past resentments,\n\n23:25.060 --> 23:27.140\n we're weeping in our sadness,\n\n23:27.140 --> 23:29.280\n and we're making the world around us colder.\n\n23:29.280 --> 23:30.380\n It's beautiful, it's great.\n\n23:30.380 --> 23:31.580\n So that's pride.\n\n23:31.580 --> 23:33.180\n See, that's an image of pride,\n\n23:33.180 --> 23:35.540\n because Satan, that's his great sin, pride,\n\n23:35.540 --> 23:38.260\n which is why he needed Michael, right, Mikael,\n\n23:38.260 --> 23:41.040\n who's like God, so that the great challenge to him,\n\n23:41.040 --> 23:43.500\n which we need all the time,\n\n23:43.500 --> 23:45.420\n is someone to say, wait a minute, wait a minute,\n\n23:45.420 --> 23:46.960\n you're not God.\n\n23:46.960 --> 23:49.220\n But the minute we say, I'm God,\n\n23:49.220 --> 23:52.660\n whew, black hole, I now cave in on myself,\n\n23:52.660 --> 23:54.940\n I suck everything into myself,\n\n23:54.940 --> 23:57.620\n and I turn into Dante Satan.\n\n23:57.620 --> 23:59.700\n So that's a great image, that's pride.\n\n23:59.700 --> 24:01.660\n That's the most fundamental.\n\n24:01.660 --> 24:04.180\n That's the uber capital sin.\n\n24:04.180 --> 24:06.260\n All the other ones flow from that, in a way.\n\n24:06.260 --> 24:10.180\n So in general, empathy, humility, compassion,\n\n24:10.180 --> 24:14.700\n love thy neighbor, is the way to fight the sin of pride.\n\n24:14.700 --> 24:16.980\n Right, which is why the masters tend to say,\n\n24:16.980 --> 24:19.300\n this was Bernard, St. Bernard was asked,\n\n24:19.300 --> 24:21.140\n what are the three most important virtues?\n\n24:21.140 --> 24:24.660\n And he said, humilitas, humilitas, and humilitas,\n\n24:24.660 --> 24:26.500\n because it's the opposite of pride.\n\n24:26.500 --> 24:29.820\n So, but you know, they're bringing Aquinas in again,\n\n24:29.820 --> 24:32.180\n because we think, oh, humility, I'm no good.\n\n24:32.180 --> 24:33.380\n That's not what it means at all.\n\n24:33.380 --> 24:35.500\n It means what I was describing before,\n\n24:35.500 --> 24:37.780\n when you're just lost in something,\n\n24:37.780 --> 24:39.860\n you're just lost in it.\n\n24:39.860 --> 24:41.940\n My image, I live out in Santa Barbara,\n\n24:41.940 --> 24:44.180\n and I like to walk on the beach out there,\n\n24:44.180 --> 24:45.620\n and there's a section of the beach\n\n24:45.620 --> 24:48.500\n where they let the dogs run free without leashes.\n\n24:48.500 --> 24:52.620\n And when you see a dog, and he's well cared for,\n\n24:52.620 --> 24:53.780\n and his master's right there,\n\n24:53.780 --> 24:56.100\n and the master's throwing the tennis ball out into the surf,\n\n24:56.100 --> 24:57.940\n and the dog goes galloping out into the surf,\n\n24:57.940 --> 25:00.660\n and he gets it with a big smile, and comes running back.\n\n25:00.660 --> 25:02.420\n That's humility.\n\n25:02.420 --> 25:03.420\n That's an image of heaven,\n\n25:03.420 --> 25:05.900\n because he's just lost in that moment.\n\n25:05.900 --> 25:07.860\n He doesn't care about impressing anybody.\n\n25:07.860 --> 25:10.620\n He doesn't care about what people think of him.\n\n25:10.620 --> 25:13.340\n He's just lost in it.\n\n25:13.340 --> 25:15.460\n That's it, that's heaven, right?\n\n25:16.380 --> 25:18.820\n And those moments in our life, when we get that,\n\n25:18.820 --> 25:21.140\n it's a little hint of paradise.\n\n25:21.140 --> 25:24.620\n But the trouble is most of us live, frankly, most of the time\n\n25:24.620 --> 25:27.860\n in various levels of hell,\n\n25:27.860 --> 25:29.940\n and we're dealing with these deadly sins.\n\n25:29.940 --> 25:32.540\n Like envy flows from pride, because if I'm prideful,\n\n25:32.540 --> 25:35.780\n I'm a black hole, I'm in Curvatus In Se, I'm collapsed in,\n\n25:35.780 --> 25:37.780\n what am I really gonna be concerned about?\n\n25:37.780 --> 25:39.140\n That guy's getting more attention than I am.\n\n25:39.140 --> 25:40.540\n That guy's richer than I am.\n\n25:40.540 --> 25:43.500\n That lady, she's got a bigger reputation than I do,\n\n25:43.500 --> 25:46.260\n and why don't I have that, right?\n\n25:46.260 --> 25:49.180\n So envy is a very close daughter of pride.\n\n25:50.460 --> 25:51.940\n Anger flows from it.\n\n25:51.940 --> 25:53.460\n Why do I get angry?\n\n25:53.460 --> 25:54.980\n The dog isn't getting angry on the beach\n\n25:54.980 --> 25:56.700\n when he's running after the tennis ball.\n\n25:56.700 --> 25:57.660\n But I get angry all the time,\n\n25:57.660 --> 25:59.980\n I sputter with anger when things aren't going my way,\n\n25:59.980 --> 26:02.580\n and you're insulting me, and you're not doing what I want,\n\n26:02.580 --> 26:04.660\n and I'm being hurt, my reputation.\n\n26:04.660 --> 26:07.540\n So anger flows from pride, you know?\n\n26:07.540 --> 26:10.260\n All of them do, all of the deadly sins do.\n\n26:10.260 --> 26:13.820\n So you said, I'm a sinner.\n\n26:13.820 --> 26:15.340\n So we're all sinners.\n\n26:15.340 --> 26:16.180\n Yeah.\n\n26:17.780 --> 26:19.220\n And you mentioned Satan.\n\n26:19.220 --> 26:22.660\n Where's the, so there's heaven and hell,\n\n26:22.660 --> 26:24.420\n there's God and Satan.\n\n26:25.380 --> 26:29.860\n Where's the line between what it means to be good\n\n26:30.940 --> 26:34.420\n and not good enough?\n\n26:34.420 --> 26:38.180\n Or I hesitate to use the word sort of evil,\n\n26:38.180 --> 26:43.020\n but maybe overwhelmingly sinful.\n\n26:43.020 --> 26:45.500\n Where's the line between hell and heaven?\n\n26:45.500 --> 26:47.100\n Think of them as limit concepts, maybe.\n\n26:47.100 --> 26:49.020\n They're like heuristic devices.\n\n26:49.020 --> 26:53.580\n So heaven would name this ultimate friendship with God.\n\n26:53.580 --> 26:54.700\n So think of the dog on the beach,\n\n26:54.700 --> 26:58.120\n who is just, he's fallen in love with his environment,\n\n26:58.120 --> 26:59.660\n with his master, with the surf.\n\n26:59.660 --> 27:01.260\n He's just lost in it, right?\n\n27:01.260 --> 27:04.400\n He's forgotten himself, he's transcended himself,\n\n27:04.400 --> 27:08.740\n and is now lost in the wonder of the beauty of that place.\n\n27:08.740 --> 27:11.540\n Now, imagine the limit of that\n\n27:11.540 --> 27:14.500\n is the friendship with God that we talked about,\n\n27:14.500 --> 27:16.140\n that I become the friend of God.\n\n27:16.140 --> 27:19.100\n I become so forgetful of myself,\n\n27:19.100 --> 27:22.260\n so lost in the beauty and truth and goodness of God\n\n27:22.260 --> 27:25.980\n that I found beatitude, right?\n\n27:25.980 --> 27:29.200\n I found joy, the beatific vision, we call it.\n\n27:30.220 --> 27:31.460\n That's the limit case.\n\n27:31.460 --> 27:32.400\n That's where we're tending.\n\n27:32.400 --> 27:34.180\n That's where God wants us to go.\n\n27:34.180 --> 27:36.180\n Think of hell as the limit case in the opposite direction.\n\n27:36.180 --> 27:37.980\n That's curvatus in se.\n\n27:37.980 --> 27:39.480\n That's the black hole.\n\n27:39.480 --> 27:40.780\n And we're all sinners,\n\n27:40.780 --> 27:42.900\n meaning we're somewhere on that spectrum.\n\n27:42.900 --> 27:45.180\n We have good days and bad days,\n\n27:45.180 --> 27:46.740\n and we have good moments and bad moments,\n\n27:46.740 --> 27:49.980\n and I can be drawn toward sin.\n\n27:51.060 --> 27:54.260\n What's God's purpose on Christianity's reading\n\n27:54.260 --> 27:56.420\n is to bring us out of that.\n\n27:56.420 --> 27:57.620\n Now, where did he go?\n\n27:57.620 --> 28:00.380\n He went all the way into it to get us out of it.\n\n28:00.380 --> 28:02.780\n It's like pulling a sock back out.\n\n28:02.780 --> 28:04.300\n The sock's inside out, you have to go all the way in\n\n28:04.300 --> 28:05.340\n and pull it back out.\n\n28:05.340 --> 28:07.900\n And so God had to go all the way down.\n\n28:08.860 --> 28:12.200\n There's the trajectory of the incarnation.\n\n28:13.860 --> 28:15.820\n Though he was in the form of God,\n\n28:15.820 --> 28:16.860\n and this is St. Paul,\n\n28:16.860 --> 28:18.380\n Jesus did not deem equality with God\n\n28:18.380 --> 28:19.220\n a thing to be grasped at,\n\n28:19.220 --> 28:21.560\n but rather emptied himself and took the form of a slave,\n\n28:21.560 --> 28:23.400\n being born in the likeness of men.\n\n28:23.400 --> 28:26.800\n But then he was known to be of human estate,\n\n28:26.800 --> 28:30.420\n and he accepted even death, death on a cross.\n\n28:30.420 --> 28:34.540\n And so Paul imagines the incarnation as this downward journey\n\n28:34.540 --> 28:36.820\n in order to get all of us, right?\n\n28:36.820 --> 28:40.820\n All of us who were stuck, were stuck in our sin.\n\n28:40.820 --> 28:44.220\n And so again, Paul says he became sin on the cross.\n\n28:44.220 --> 28:46.740\n It's a really, really powerful idea.\n\n28:46.740 --> 28:49.460\n He wasn't a sinner, because then he'd need to be saved too.\n\n28:49.460 --> 28:53.380\n He's not a sinner, but he entered into our dysfunction\n\n28:53.380 --> 28:55.700\n in order to pull us back out of it.\n\n28:55.700 --> 29:00.700\n So that's a really powerful message, an embodiment,\n\n29:02.100 --> 29:05.060\n sort of educating the world about sin.\n\n29:07.020 --> 29:09.180\n That said, day to day,\n\n29:09.180 --> 29:14.180\n there's oscillations in terms of how much each human sins,\n\n29:15.580 --> 29:17.980\n and there's a struggle against that.\n\n29:17.980 --> 29:22.980\n So that dog that loses himself on the beach\n\n29:22.980 --> 29:26.860\n may have had a lot of sex with other dogs leading up to that.\n\n29:26.860 --> 29:30.580\n That was, may have been not the best dog\n\n29:30.580 --> 29:32.540\n he could be leading up to that.\n\n29:32.540 --> 29:35.540\n So how, if it's a math equation,\n\n29:35.540 --> 29:38.780\n what does the final calculation look like\n\n29:38.780 --> 29:40.940\n in terms of ending up in heaven?\n\n29:40.940 --> 29:44.580\n What does it mean to live a good life in the end?\n\n29:44.580 --> 29:49.580\n Is it the average amount of sin you do is low?\n\n29:50.100 --> 29:52.380\n Are you allowed to make mistakes?\n\n29:52.380 --> 29:56.900\n Yeah, the metric is love, right?\n\n29:56.900 --> 29:59.860\n And love is not a feeling, it's an act of the will.\n\n29:59.860 --> 30:01.580\n To will the good of the other.\n\n30:01.580 --> 30:02.540\n That's Aquinas again.\n\n30:02.540 --> 30:04.860\n To will the good of the other as other.\n\n30:04.860 --> 30:07.540\n You see, that's the anti black hole principle.\n\n30:07.540 --> 30:08.980\n When I, I don't.\n\n30:08.980 --> 30:10.500\n Will the good of the other.\n\n30:10.500 --> 30:11.340\n As other.\n\n30:11.340 --> 30:13.380\n See, because if I'm willing your good,\n\n30:13.380 --> 30:15.020\n because it's good for me.\n\n30:15.020 --> 30:17.940\n So again, it's good for you that I'm on this program,\n\n30:17.940 --> 30:19.140\n I guess, I'm willing your good,\n\n30:19.140 --> 30:21.700\n but that's because it's gonna be down to my benefit.\n\n30:21.700 --> 30:23.940\n That's just an indirect egotism.\n\n30:23.940 --> 30:26.500\n That's why I see love is really rare and strange,\n\n30:26.500 --> 30:31.500\n that I really want what's good for you as other.\n\n30:32.340 --> 30:34.860\n So not connected to the black hole tendency\n\n30:34.860 --> 30:36.700\n of my own prideful ego.\n\n30:36.700 --> 30:39.940\n When I've broken that, I've forgotten self\n\n30:39.940 --> 30:43.020\n and I've moved into the space of your own good.\n\n30:43.020 --> 30:44.220\n That's what love is.\n\n30:44.220 --> 30:46.700\n Now, God wants us to be,\n\n30:46.700 --> 30:48.780\n by this they will know that you're my disciples,\n\n30:48.780 --> 30:50.460\n that you love one another, Jesus says.\n\n30:50.460 --> 30:52.220\n So that's it.\n\n30:52.220 --> 30:56.140\n Now, I mean, life is ups and downs and back and forth\n\n30:56.140 --> 30:57.980\n and we're better or worse at that.\n\n30:59.820 --> 31:02.500\n The point of a church is to graft us onto Christ\n\n31:02.500 --> 31:05.100\n that we might become more and more conformed to love.\n\n31:05.100 --> 31:07.220\n But you know, the final calculus, I'll leave that to God.\n\n31:07.220 --> 31:09.820\n I mean, but use love as the metric.\n\n31:09.820 --> 31:12.660\n At the end of the day, when you examine your conscience,\n\n31:12.660 --> 31:14.860\n did I will the good of the other today?\n\n31:14.860 --> 31:17.380\n How effective was I at that?\n\n31:17.380 --> 31:21.220\n And be, just like Ignatius of Loyola, be brutally honest.\n\n31:21.220 --> 31:22.660\n Or was I just willing someone's good\n\n31:22.660 --> 31:24.020\n because it was good for me?\n\n31:25.500 --> 31:27.540\n Where were those moments where I was like the dog\n\n31:27.540 --> 31:29.380\n on the beach, see?\n\n31:29.380 --> 31:30.780\n And then see, play it the way,\n\n31:30.780 --> 31:33.580\n not so much God the law giver surveying\n\n31:33.580 --> 31:35.740\n and you did three of those and four.\n\n31:35.740 --> 31:39.220\n It's God wants us to be fully alive.\n\n31:39.220 --> 31:41.100\n Saint Irenaeus is one of my great heroes,\n\n31:41.100 --> 31:43.140\n ancient, you know, patristic figure.\n\n31:43.140 --> 31:46.420\n And his famous line is gloria de homo vivens, right?\n\n31:46.420 --> 31:50.820\n The glory of God is a human being fully alive.\n\n31:50.820 --> 31:53.620\n See, and that gets us over this sort of obsession\n\n31:53.620 --> 31:55.860\n with the illegalism and did I do enough?\n\n31:55.860 --> 31:58.140\n And is that, that's a big enough sin.\n\n31:58.140 --> 32:00.260\n God wants us fully alive.\n\n32:00.260 --> 32:02.700\n The key to that is willing the good of the other.\n\n32:02.700 --> 32:07.260\n He died that we might come to a richer\n\n32:07.260 --> 32:08.740\n appropriation of that.\n\n32:08.740 --> 32:13.740\n So to be fully alive is to be in love with the world\n\n32:13.740 --> 32:17.900\n or to love the world deeply.\n\n32:17.900 --> 32:20.860\n And what love means is the other.\n\n32:20.860 --> 32:21.700\n Is.\n\n32:21.700 --> 32:22.540\n Get out of yourself, right.\n\n32:22.540 --> 32:26.020\n It's the humility, yeah, getting out of yourself.\n\n32:26.020 --> 32:26.860\n Let go.\n\n32:26.860 --> 32:31.340\n That somehow is not, that's not even selfless\n\n32:31.340 --> 32:35.460\n because the word selfless requires there to be a self.\n\n32:35.460 --> 32:38.140\n It's almost like just letting go.\n\n32:38.140 --> 32:39.980\n Yeah, I might talk about like a gift of self\n\n32:39.980 --> 32:43.940\n that you're self aware but you give a gift of yourself.\n\n32:43.940 --> 32:46.780\n Your self becomes not a magnet drawing things into itself\n\n32:46.780 --> 32:49.740\n but it becomes a radiant source of life for others.\n\n32:49.740 --> 32:51.460\n I think Mother Teresa would have had a keen sense\n\n32:51.460 --> 32:52.700\n of herself, it seems to me.\n\n32:52.700 --> 32:57.020\n But it was to light other people up\n\n32:57.020 --> 33:00.100\n so that they might be radiant.\n\n33:00.100 --> 33:00.940\n That's the game.\n\n33:00.940 --> 33:03.980\n So you could probably articulate it that way too.\n\n33:03.980 --> 33:05.460\n Yeah.\n\n33:05.460 --> 33:06.540\n I love love.\n\n33:06.540 --> 33:08.380\n It's such an interesting thing.\n\n33:08.380 --> 33:09.620\n But we have to be hard nosed about it.\n\n33:09.620 --> 33:11.460\n Like your friend Dostoevsky,\n\n33:11.460 --> 33:13.780\n love is a harsh and dreadful thing, right.\n\n33:13.780 --> 33:14.940\n It's not a feeling.\n\n33:14.940 --> 33:17.140\n And our culture is so sentimentalized love\n\n33:17.140 --> 33:20.020\n that it's having warm feelings or doing what people want.\n\n33:20.020 --> 33:20.860\n And that's not it at all.\n\n33:20.860 --> 33:24.500\n Love is always correlated to the order of the good.\n\n33:24.500 --> 33:26.420\n Because if I'm willing the good of the other,\n\n33:26.420 --> 33:28.660\n I have to know what that good is, right.\n\n33:28.660 --> 33:30.340\n So a parent does this, oh, I'll give the kid\n\n33:30.340 --> 33:31.540\n whatever she wants.\n\n33:31.540 --> 33:33.380\n Well, that's not love, that's indulgence\n\n33:33.380 --> 33:35.540\n or that's sentimentality.\n\n33:35.540 --> 33:37.920\n But I have to know what the goods really are\n\n33:37.920 --> 33:39.940\n if I'm gonna will them for you, right.\n\n33:39.940 --> 33:43.020\n Yeah, in some sense, you're absolutely right.\n\n33:43.020 --> 33:47.220\n A component of love is the struggle to know the other.\n\n33:47.220 --> 33:48.060\n Right.\n\n33:48.060 --> 33:49.620\n It's the struggle to understand.\n\n33:49.620 --> 33:52.020\n I mean, that's what I mean by empathy.\n\n33:52.020 --> 33:57.020\n It's the, yeah, it's not Valentine's Day romantic gifts.\n\n33:57.180 --> 33:59.700\n It's a struggle.\n\n33:59.700 --> 34:02.540\n It's like trying to understand,\n\n34:02.540 --> 34:04.440\n trying to perturb your own mind\n\n34:04.440 --> 34:06.880\n and that of another human being\n\n34:06.880 --> 34:09.180\n to try to figure out who they are,\n\n34:09.180 --> 34:12.820\n what they want, what makes them happy,\n\n34:12.820 --> 34:16.340\n what are they afraid of, what are they hoping for.\n\n34:16.340 --> 34:19.620\n And it's like a dance, a dance of conversation,\n\n34:19.620 --> 34:23.700\n a dance of just shared experiences\n\n34:23.700 --> 34:24.620\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n34:24.620 --> 34:26.620\n And all of that requires for you to be,\n\n34:27.660 --> 34:31.300\n I guess, yeah, empathize.\n\n34:31.300 --> 34:35.900\n Imagine yourself in their place\n\n34:35.900 --> 34:38.220\n and then love that person\n\n34:38.220 --> 34:40.900\n when you're living inside that person.\n\n34:40.900 --> 34:42.460\n Yeah, several minutes ago\n\n34:42.460 --> 34:43.780\n about the pillars of Christianity.\n\n34:43.780 --> 34:45.540\n So we talked about God, talked about incarnation,\n\n34:45.540 --> 34:48.580\n but you're getting now to a third key one,\n\n34:48.580 --> 34:50.060\n namely the Trinity.\n\n34:50.060 --> 34:52.540\n Because we're monotheists, right,\n\n34:52.540 --> 34:54.900\n but we don't think God is monolithically one.\n\n34:54.900 --> 34:57.380\n We think God is a play of persons.\n\n34:57.380 --> 35:01.780\n And the Father from all eternity\n\n35:01.780 --> 35:06.780\n by a great mental act forms his interior word,\n\n35:07.220 --> 35:08.820\n as Aquinas puts it.\n\n35:08.820 --> 35:10.060\n And that's the logos, right?\n\n35:10.060 --> 35:12.020\n That's the verbum, that's the word\n\n35:12.020 --> 35:13.420\n by which the Father knows himself.\n\n35:13.420 --> 35:14.780\n And we call it the Son.\n\n35:14.780 --> 35:17.100\n So the imago, it's the image of the Father.\n\n35:17.100 --> 35:18.540\n But then see, the great thing is\n\n35:18.540 --> 35:21.940\n that imago is not like just a dead image on a mirror\n\n35:21.940 --> 35:24.180\n or a dead image at a pond or something.\n\n35:24.180 --> 35:29.180\n It's a full reflection of the Father's being.\n\n35:29.180 --> 35:31.580\n He's one in being with the Father.\n\n35:31.580 --> 35:33.900\n Therefore, the Son has everything the Father has\n\n35:33.900 --> 35:35.420\n except being the Father.\n\n35:35.420 --> 35:38.820\n But that means that the two of them look at each other\n\n35:38.820 --> 35:41.540\n and they're just crazy in love with each other\n\n35:41.540 --> 35:44.980\n because the Father's the fullness of being,\n\n35:44.980 --> 35:46.660\n the Son is the fullness of being.\n\n35:46.660 --> 35:49.260\n And they're so crazy in love with each other that they,\n\n35:49.260 --> 35:52.100\n this is Fulton Sheen put it this way,\n\n35:52.100 --> 35:54.980\n that there's this, ah, they just,\n\n35:54.980 --> 35:58.140\n they love each other with this sigh.\n\n35:58.140 --> 36:00.220\n And we call that the Spiritus Sanctus.\n\n36:00.220 --> 36:01.500\n That's the holy breath, right?\n\n36:01.500 --> 36:06.140\n The holy sigh of love between the Father and the Son.\n\n36:06.140 --> 36:10.580\n And that's one being, one essence we say of God.\n\n36:10.580 --> 36:12.540\n But in these three persons,\n\n36:12.540 --> 36:14.220\n but all your language about like dance\n\n36:14.220 --> 36:16.820\n and play and community,\n\n36:16.820 --> 36:18.780\n the Greek Fathers talked about perichoresis,\n\n36:18.780 --> 36:21.100\n which means God, the three persons kind of sit\n\n36:21.100 --> 36:23.180\n in a choir together.\n\n36:23.180 --> 36:27.820\n So they sing together, you know?\n\n36:27.820 --> 36:32.300\n And that's why, see, Christianity is unique in this claim,\n\n36:32.300 --> 36:34.860\n that God is love.\n\n36:34.860 --> 36:37.140\n So every religion will say God loves,\n\n36:37.140 --> 36:38.100\n you know, in some way.\n\n36:38.100 --> 36:40.420\n Love is an attribute of God.\n\n36:40.420 --> 36:43.220\n God is, or love is a thing that God does sometimes.\n\n36:43.220 --> 36:45.300\n But Christianity is unique in all the religions\n\n36:45.300 --> 36:47.740\n in saying that God is love.\n\n36:47.740 --> 36:52.060\n And somehow the Holy Trinity embodies that idea.\n\n36:52.060 --> 36:56.740\n I mean, that philosophically has always been confusing to me,\n\n36:56.740 --> 37:00.980\n what it means to be three things\n\n37:00.980 --> 37:04.700\n and at the same time be one God,\n\n37:04.700 --> 37:07.860\n the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\n37:07.860 --> 37:10.580\n What is this dance between these three?\n\n37:10.580 --> 37:13.500\n What exact, like how do you visualize,\n\n37:13.500 --> 37:15.020\n how do you understand this?\n\n37:15.020 --> 37:15.860\n Yeah.\n\n37:15.860 --> 37:20.180\n This very fascinating, essential thing for Christianity.\n\n37:20.180 --> 37:21.540\n The first thing I'd say is what we already\n\n37:21.540 --> 37:22.500\n have been sort of talking about,\n\n37:22.500 --> 37:24.140\n is if you say God is love,\n\n37:24.140 --> 37:25.980\n and most people probably say, yeah, I like that.\n\n37:25.980 --> 37:27.300\n It's a good idea, God is love.\n\n37:27.300 --> 37:30.980\n But it's very peculiar because if he is love,\n\n37:30.980 --> 37:35.980\n there has to be in his unity a lover, a beloved,\n\n37:36.500 --> 37:37.660\n and the love that they share.\n\n37:37.660 --> 37:40.340\n Otherwise he isn't loved by his very essence.\n\n37:40.340 --> 37:43.980\n He would love, it would be an attribute of God\n\n37:43.980 --> 37:45.020\n or an action of God.\n\n37:45.020 --> 37:46.820\n But if it's his very nature,\n\n37:46.820 --> 37:49.820\n there has to be lover, beloved, and love shared.\n\n37:49.820 --> 37:52.580\n And the tradition eventually came to see that.\n\n37:52.580 --> 37:55.260\n The image I was using before of the Father,\n\n37:55.260 --> 38:00.260\n his imago, the Son, well that's born of God's infinite mind.\n\n38:00.260 --> 38:02.260\n So of course God has an image of himself.\n\n38:02.260 --> 38:04.100\n Heck, I've got an image of myself.\n\n38:04.100 --> 38:07.140\n That's something I can pull off as a puny little creature.\n\n38:07.140 --> 38:11.500\n God in his infinity has a perfect imago of himself.\n\n38:11.500 --> 38:13.540\n And they have to fall in love with each other.\n\n38:13.540 --> 38:14.900\n What else can they do?\n\n38:14.900 --> 38:17.900\n Because they're in the presence of infinite good.\n\n38:17.900 --> 38:20.820\n And so it has to follow that you then have\n\n38:20.820 --> 38:22.860\n the shared love that connects them.\n\n38:22.860 --> 38:24.460\n And that's how we generate, if you want,\n\n38:24.460 --> 38:26.920\n this idea of the three persons in God.\n\n38:27.980 --> 38:30.940\n Let me ask you about the church.\n\n38:30.940 --> 38:34.020\n One of the defining characteristics of Catholicism\n\n38:35.460 --> 38:37.020\n is the Catholic church.\n\n38:38.020 --> 38:39.740\n What is the Catholic church?\n\n38:40.700 --> 38:43.060\n I would say it's the mystical body of Jesus.\n\n38:43.060 --> 38:45.380\n So as I said before, it's not an organization.\n\n38:45.380 --> 38:46.820\n If we do it that way, we're gonna miss it.\n\n38:46.820 --> 38:48.900\n It's got organizational elements to it.\n\n38:48.900 --> 38:52.980\n So I'm a bishop, I'm a office holder within the church.\n\n38:52.980 --> 38:56.940\n But the church is an organism, not an organization.\n\n38:56.940 --> 39:01.340\n So it's a organism of interconnected cells, as I said,\n\n39:01.340 --> 39:02.660\n namely all of the baptized,\n\n39:02.660 --> 39:06.620\n gathered around Christ in a mystical union.\n\n39:06.620 --> 39:07.940\n That's the church.\n\n39:07.940 --> 39:10.420\n But there's buildings, there's titles.\n\n39:10.420 --> 39:14.180\n Sure, because it manifests itself institutionally then.\n\n39:14.180 --> 39:18.180\n So are the sort of heavy things about that\n\n39:18.180 --> 39:19.900\n all have to do with pride?\n\n39:19.900 --> 39:20.740\n Yeah, sure.\n\n39:20.740 --> 39:22.540\n The sexiness of the buildings?\n\n39:22.540 --> 39:24.300\n Yeah, no, whatever is corrupt in the church,\n\n39:24.300 --> 39:26.660\n of course, it comes from pride, from sin.\n\n39:26.660 --> 39:28.620\n And one thing I like about the New Testament\n\n39:28.620 --> 39:29.900\n is so clear on that.\n\n39:29.900 --> 39:32.260\n Paul is, in his little tiny communities,\n\n39:32.260 --> 39:35.060\n so before there was a Vatican or dioceses or anything,\n\n39:35.060 --> 39:36.920\n Paul had these little tiny communities of Christians\n\n39:36.920 --> 39:38.780\n like in Corinth and Ephesus.\n\n39:39.860 --> 39:41.020\n What's the one thing we know about them?\n\n39:41.020 --> 39:42.620\n Is they fought with each other.\n\n39:42.620 --> 39:44.660\n Because Paul's always uprating them\n\n39:44.660 --> 39:48.300\n and telling them, come on, would you people get it together?\n\n39:48.300 --> 39:49.980\n Who's bewitched you?\n\n39:49.980 --> 39:52.580\n So from the beginning, we've been fighting with each other\n\n39:52.580 --> 39:54.220\n because we're made up of sinners.\n\n39:55.860 --> 39:59.020\n So one thing we do in Catholic ecclesiology\n\n39:59.020 --> 40:00.980\n is the official name for the study of the church,\n\n40:00.980 --> 40:04.700\n is to talk about the treasure in earthen vessels.\n\n40:04.700 --> 40:05.880\n Paul's language again.\n\n40:05.880 --> 40:07.060\n The treasure is Christ.\n\n40:07.060 --> 40:11.140\n The treasure is the love he's bequeathed to the world.\n\n40:11.140 --> 40:12.820\n That's the treasure that we have.\n\n40:12.820 --> 40:15.440\n But it's always held in these really fragile vessels,\n\n40:15.440 --> 40:18.300\n namely us, and so it's gonna be marked by corruption\n\n40:18.300 --> 40:21.260\n and stupidity and pride and everything else.\n\n40:21.260 --> 40:23.900\n Well, nevertheless, there's a hierarchy.\n\n40:23.900 --> 40:25.760\n There's titles and so on.\n\n40:26.820 --> 40:28.920\n If we remove pride from the picture,\n\n40:28.920 --> 40:31.940\n so the best possible interpretation of the hierarchy\n\n40:31.940 --> 40:36.300\n that makes up this one organism, this living organism,\n\n40:36.300 --> 40:39.860\n what's the role of the pope, for example?\n\n40:39.860 --> 40:44.540\n What is the role of a bishop, for example?\n\n40:44.540 --> 40:46.220\n What is the role of the hierarchy\n\n40:46.220 --> 40:49.900\n in terms of the broader vision of Christianity,\n\n40:49.900 --> 40:51.560\n Catholicism as a religion?\n\n40:52.560 --> 40:54.900\n I'm a devotee of this guy named Johann Adam M\u00fcller,\n\n40:54.900 --> 40:57.600\n who was a theologian early part of the 19th century,\n\n40:57.600 --> 41:00.420\n and he was part of the kind of romantic movement.\n\n41:00.420 --> 41:04.860\n And he said the purpose of the pope is to symbolize\n\n41:04.860 --> 41:09.860\n and embody and draw together the unity of the entire church.\n\n41:10.740 --> 41:14.060\n So he's the personal symbol of the unity of the church.\n\n41:14.060 --> 41:15.080\n Who's a bishop?\n\n41:15.080 --> 41:17.280\n The bishop is the personal symbol\n\n41:17.280 --> 41:19.500\n of the unity of a diocese.\n\n41:19.500 --> 41:20.940\n Who's a pastor of a parish?\n\n41:20.940 --> 41:24.440\n He's the personal symbol of the unity of that parish.\n\n41:24.440 --> 41:27.380\n So he understood it not so much organizationally\n\n41:27.380 --> 41:28.540\n as organically, again.\n\n41:28.540 --> 41:32.460\n It was like, what, that around which the pattern\n\n41:32.460 --> 41:34.340\n organizes itself.\n\n41:34.340 --> 41:37.380\n And if you don't have that unifying figure,\n\n41:37.380 --> 41:39.300\n the community will kind of reciprocate.\n\n41:39.300 --> 41:40.480\n And you see that all the time.\n\n41:40.480 --> 41:43.060\n Without headship, we would say.\n\n41:43.060 --> 41:45.160\n So it's more symbolic and organic\n\n41:45.160 --> 41:47.460\n than it is organizational.\n\n41:47.460 --> 41:49.020\n So symbols for community.\n\n41:49.020 --> 41:52.980\n But there's such fascinating peculiarities\n\n41:52.980 --> 41:55.360\n to each individual symbol.\n\n41:55.360 --> 41:56.700\n There's different characteristics\n\n41:56.700 --> 41:58.780\n that make up the different people.\n\n41:58.780 --> 42:01.340\n They have different ways of communicating.\n\n42:01.340 --> 42:02.740\n They have different hopes and fears\n\n42:02.740 --> 42:04.140\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n42:06.500 --> 42:08.220\n If they're all symbols,\n\n42:08.220 --> 42:13.220\n what's the role of the different peculiarities\n\n42:13.580 --> 42:14.860\n of those symbols?\n\n42:14.860 --> 42:19.860\n Of being an inspiring uniter versus maybe a stronger type\n\n42:20.220 --> 42:25.220\n of more judgmental kind of communicator,\n\n42:26.860 --> 42:27.820\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n42:27.820 --> 42:32.820\n Can you maybe speak to the human part of these symbols?\n\n42:32.820 --> 42:37.160\n Yeah, well, I might just shift to another image of shepherd.\n\n42:37.160 --> 42:38.960\n So that's a classic biblical image.\n\n42:38.960 --> 42:40.760\n And as a bishop, I walk around with this thing\n\n42:40.760 --> 42:43.040\n called a crozier, which is a shepherd's staff.\n\n42:43.040 --> 42:45.680\n So it's the symbol of the bishop's office.\n\n42:45.680 --> 42:50.360\n And the crozier, though, is a kind of in your face thing\n\n42:50.360 --> 42:53.520\n in a way, because it's got the end of it\n\n42:53.520 --> 42:55.960\n was meant to hold off wild animals.\n\n42:55.960 --> 42:59.000\n And then the crook part of it was meant to bring sheep back\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.320\n to the fold.\n\n43:00.320 --> 43:01.760\n So I walk in with that, oh, this is nice.\n\n43:01.760 --> 43:03.120\n Oh, look at the bishop coming in.\n\n43:03.120 --> 43:05.800\n But that's a kind of in your face symbol\n\n43:05.800 --> 43:09.920\n that I'm here to defend the church against predators.\n\n43:09.920 --> 43:12.000\n And I'm also here to draw people in\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.840\n who are wandering too far away.\n\n43:13.840 --> 43:14.680\n So that's okay.\n\n43:14.680 --> 43:17.120\n I mean, that's part of the role of the hierarchy\n\n43:17.120 --> 43:20.320\n and the Pope and bishops and pastors.\n\n43:20.320 --> 43:21.800\n Pastor just means shepherd, right?\n\n43:21.800 --> 43:24.200\n So I'm the shepherd of a parish.\n\n43:24.200 --> 43:25.040\n So that's okay.\n\n43:25.040 --> 43:26.920\n It's not like just all sunshine and light\n\n43:26.920 --> 43:28.320\n and what a pretty image.\n\n43:28.320 --> 43:30.920\n The one who embodies the unity of the community\n\n43:30.920 --> 43:31.920\n is also the shepherd.\n\n43:32.920 --> 43:36.400\n Okay, but again, leaning on the human thing.\n\n43:36.400 --> 43:37.560\n Yeah.\n\n43:37.560 --> 43:39.360\n The church is an institution.\n\n43:40.360 --> 43:42.360\n And I don't know if you've heard,\n\n43:42.360 --> 43:46.160\n but there is an element of power that corrupts.\n\n43:46.160 --> 43:48.640\n An absolute power corrupts absolutely,\n\n43:48.640 --> 43:49.880\n as the old saying goes.\n\n43:51.880 --> 43:53.680\n Let me ask you something else that came up\n\n43:53.680 --> 43:56.080\n on the Reddit AMA.\n\n43:56.080 --> 43:59.400\n Yeah, megachurches and the prosperity gospel.\n\n43:59.400 --> 44:03.760\n And you've mentioned that you may not be a fan.\n\n44:03.760 --> 44:05.000\n What are your views on this?\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:08.120\n And what are your views in general of money and power\n\n44:08.120 --> 44:10.800\n corrupting the heads of these institutions?\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.760\n I don't like the prosperity gospel\n\n44:13.760 --> 44:17.400\n because the gospel is about Jesus journey\n\n44:17.400 --> 44:21.240\n into radical self forgetfulness on the cross.\n\n44:21.240 --> 44:24.360\n And he never makes a promise of earthly,\n\n44:24.360 --> 44:27.640\n of earthly well being.\n\n44:27.640 --> 44:29.840\n Can you explain what the prosperity gospel is?\n\n44:29.840 --> 44:31.800\n Yeah, the view that if I follow Jesus\n\n44:31.800 --> 44:33.600\n and I follow God with great trust\n\n44:33.600 --> 44:37.280\n that I will be rewarded with wealth and position\n\n44:37.280 --> 44:39.160\n and status in this world.\n\n44:39.160 --> 44:41.120\n It might be God's will when I get that.\n\n44:41.120 --> 44:42.640\n But you know, Aquinas said this,\n\n44:42.640 --> 44:44.240\n say I look at a very sinful person,\n\n44:44.240 --> 44:45.680\n I say, kind of, he's got a great house\n\n44:45.680 --> 44:47.720\n and he's richer than I am and all that.\n\n44:47.720 --> 44:51.120\n Aquinas says, yeah, but maybe that's a punishment.\n\n44:51.120 --> 44:53.480\n Cause maybe all that is leading him away from God.\n\n44:53.480 --> 44:55.320\n And actually that's God's way of punishing him.\n\n44:55.320 --> 44:57.560\n And the fact that you don't have wealth in a big house\n\n44:57.560 --> 44:59.160\n is actually a great gift to you\n\n44:59.160 --> 45:02.440\n because now it frees you for doing God's will.\n\n45:02.440 --> 45:07.440\n So we can't read, you know, God's favor in worldly terms.\n\n45:08.480 --> 45:13.120\n I would say God's favor is, am I awakened to deeper love?\n\n45:13.120 --> 45:15.360\n Then I know that I'm finding God's favor.\n\n45:15.360 --> 45:17.080\n Now, God might decide, sure,\n\n45:17.080 --> 45:18.600\n I want you to have this and that.\n\n45:18.600 --> 45:20.120\n I want to provide this to you.\n\n45:20.120 --> 45:20.960\n Fine.\n\n45:20.960 --> 45:21.920\n Then I say, thank you, Lord.\n\n45:21.920 --> 45:24.200\n How can I use it as an instrument of love?\n\n45:25.840 --> 45:27.800\n All the masters talk about detachment.\n\n45:27.800 --> 45:29.680\n And that's another reason I don't like the prosperity gospel\n\n45:29.680 --> 45:31.680\n is though I'm getting attached now\n\n45:31.680 --> 45:34.040\n to all these material advantages.\n\n45:34.040 --> 45:37.280\n And I'm even seeing them as a sign of God's favor.\n\n45:37.280 --> 45:38.360\n Let go of all that.\n\n45:38.360 --> 45:41.040\n You let go of it and use it as a vehicle of love.\n\n45:41.040 --> 45:43.360\n So if you're rich, the right question is,\n\n45:43.360 --> 45:46.240\n okay, Lord, why did you allow me to become rich?\n\n45:46.240 --> 45:47.640\n So that, what can I do?\n\n45:47.640 --> 45:50.000\n How can my riches be an expression of love?\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.360\n If I'm popular, if I'm healthy,\n\n45:52.360 --> 45:53.640\n okay, why am I popular?\n\n45:53.640 --> 45:54.480\n Why am I healthy?\n\n45:54.480 --> 45:56.640\n How can I use that for your good?\n\n45:56.640 --> 45:59.920\n I'm sick, in bed, I'm suffering.\n\n45:59.920 --> 46:03.480\n Okay, Lord, how can I use that as an expression of love?\n\n46:03.480 --> 46:05.480\n So I'd rather measure it that way\n\n46:05.480 --> 46:07.540\n than through worldly success.\n\n46:07.540 --> 46:10.000\n That's why I'm against the prosperity gospel.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:10.840\n Okay.\n\n46:10.840 --> 46:15.600\n So there's a, don't seek worldly possessions,\n\n46:15.600 --> 46:19.280\n but whatever happens to you, good or bad,\n\n46:19.280 --> 46:21.860\n seek how that could be used\n\n46:21.860 --> 46:23.940\n to increase the amount of love in the world.\n\n46:23.940 --> 46:24.780\n Right.\n\n46:24.780 --> 46:27.320\n The image I love for this is the Wheel of Fortune,\n\n46:27.320 --> 46:29.840\n which is a device on a lot of the Gothic cathedrals.\n\n46:29.840 --> 46:32.400\n And it's this great circle, right, this wheel.\n\n46:32.400 --> 46:34.280\n At the top of it is a king.\n\n46:34.280 --> 46:35.200\n And then it turns this way,\n\n46:35.200 --> 46:36.520\n and the king has lost his crown.\n\n46:36.520 --> 46:37.920\n And the bottom is a pauper.\n\n46:37.920 --> 46:39.600\n And then over here is a king,\n\n46:39.600 --> 46:42.520\n is a guy climbing up to power, right?\n\n46:42.520 --> 46:45.740\n And then in the middle is a depiction of Christ.\n\n46:45.740 --> 46:47.720\n And the idea is just very simple, but very profound,\n\n46:47.720 --> 46:49.400\n that the wheel is life, you know?\n\n46:49.400 --> 46:51.880\n It's sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down.\n\n46:51.880 --> 46:55.160\n Sometimes you have power and popularity and prestige.\n\n46:55.160 --> 46:56.760\n Other times you're losing it, you're going down.\n\n46:56.760 --> 46:57.940\n Other times you got none of it.\n\n46:57.940 --> 46:59.440\n Other times you're coming back up.\n\n46:59.440 --> 47:00.280\n Okay.\n\n47:00.280 --> 47:01.840\n Don't live on the rim of the wheel.\n\n47:01.840 --> 47:02.840\n It'll make you crazy.\n\n47:02.840 --> 47:06.240\n Every point on the rim of the wheel is a point of anxiety.\n\n47:06.240 --> 47:08.240\n Where you should live is the center of the wheel,\n\n47:08.240 --> 47:10.040\n where Christ is, right?\n\n47:10.040 --> 47:13.320\n Because that's the link now to the eternity of God.\n\n47:13.320 --> 47:15.640\n That's the point of love,\n\n47:15.640 --> 47:17.560\n where love can flow through you to the world.\n\n47:17.560 --> 47:19.920\n And then you can look at the wheel.\n\n47:19.920 --> 47:21.220\n You're a Beatles fan, right?\n\n47:21.220 --> 47:22.060\n I think I discovered that.\n\n47:22.060 --> 47:23.320\n I love the Beatles.\n\n47:23.320 --> 47:25.520\n And the song that always comes to my mind\n\n47:25.520 --> 47:27.800\n when I think of that image is John Lennon,\n\n47:27.800 --> 47:28.800\n the end of his life.\n\n47:29.680 --> 47:32.920\n So a guy that, I mean, rode the wheel of fortune like crazy.\n\n47:32.920 --> 47:36.480\n You know, he was at the top of the world in every way.\n\n47:36.480 --> 47:39.060\n And then Beatles break up and he kind of loses it.\n\n47:39.060 --> 47:41.360\n And then he's at the lost weekend in the 70s\n\n47:41.360 --> 47:42.600\n at the very bottom.\n\n47:42.600 --> 47:45.300\n When he died, he was just kind of coming back up again.\n\n47:45.300 --> 47:48.280\n But the song I always think of is watching the wheels,\n\n47:48.280 --> 47:49.120\n right?\n\n47:49.120 --> 47:50.280\n I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round.\n\n47:50.280 --> 47:51.800\n I really love to watch them roll\n\n47:51.800 --> 47:54.420\n because I'm no longer riding on the merry go round.\n\n47:54.420 --> 47:56.020\n That's right out of the medieval mystics,\n\n47:56.020 --> 47:59.280\n that he's not riding on the wheel.\n\n47:59.280 --> 48:01.360\n He's just watching it go round and round.\n\n48:01.360 --> 48:04.560\n That's the point of, the Greeks called it apotheia,\n\n48:04.560 --> 48:08.960\n and the Latins called it indifference, you know?\n\n48:08.960 --> 48:12.640\n Not like I'm blas\u00e9, it just means I'm detached\n\n48:12.640 --> 48:16.880\n from success, failure, less success, more success.\n\n48:16.880 --> 48:18.160\n I'm detached from that.\n\n48:18.160 --> 48:20.660\n I'm sitting here watching the wheel go round and round\n\n48:20.660 --> 48:22.600\n because I'm not riding on it anymore.\n\n48:22.600 --> 48:25.640\n The mystics have always made that transition.\n\n48:25.640 --> 48:27.840\n Let me ask you a difficult question\n\n48:27.840 --> 48:29.960\n about the darker side of human nature,\n\n48:29.960 --> 48:34.440\n of human power, of institutions.\n\n48:34.440 --> 48:36.120\n What's your view on the long history\n\n48:36.120 --> 48:39.680\n and widespread reports of sexual abuse of children\n\n48:39.680 --> 48:40.840\n by a Catholic priest?\n\n48:40.840 --> 48:43.000\n So this is a difficult topic,\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.480\n but maybe an important one to shine a light on.\n\n48:45.480 --> 48:48.440\n Yeah, it's awful, you know, and it's been a problem.\n\n48:48.440 --> 48:51.200\n Go back to Peter Damian back in the 11th century\n\n48:51.200 --> 48:52.320\n was talking about it.\n\n48:52.320 --> 48:54.980\n So it's been a problem, and whenever really sinful\n\n48:54.980 --> 48:57.440\n human beings have been in close proximity to children,\n\n48:57.440 --> 48:59.360\n we find this issue.\n\n48:59.360 --> 49:00.520\n Has it been around the church?\n\n49:00.520 --> 49:01.360\n Yes.\n\n49:03.320 --> 49:06.000\n Has it surfaced in a kind of sickening way\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:07.000\n in the last 30 years?\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:07.900\n Absolutely.\n\n49:07.900 --> 49:12.560\n So I'm glad the church has made important strides,\n\n49:12.560 --> 49:13.880\n and it has.\n\n49:13.880 --> 49:16.840\n Back in 2002, there was a thing called the Dallas Accords\n\n49:16.840 --> 49:18.400\n where the bishops of America\n\n49:18.400 --> 49:20.400\n put a lot of these protocols in place\n\n49:20.400 --> 49:22.640\n that really have been effective\n\n49:22.640 --> 49:24.800\n at ameliorating this problem.\n\n49:24.800 --> 49:27.360\n The numbers spiked in the 70s and 80s,\n\n49:27.360 --> 49:29.360\n and that's been demonstrated over and over again.\n\n49:29.360 --> 49:31.440\n And then they fell dramatically after that.\n\n49:31.440 --> 49:33.760\n So that's not to excuse anything,\n\n49:33.760 --> 49:36.360\n but it's to say I think progress has been made with it.\n\n49:36.360 --> 49:38.920\n What's the impulse to secrecy?\n\n49:38.920 --> 49:40.960\n Yeah, well, to protect institutions.\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:43.520\n That's always, that's a sinful instinct.\n\n49:43.520 --> 49:44.360\n I'm not all together.\n\n49:44.360 --> 49:46.280\n I mean, sure, an institution is worth protecting,\n\n49:46.280 --> 49:48.080\n but if it reaches the point where you're indifferent\n\n49:48.080 --> 49:52.240\n to people's wellbeing, then you're in trouble.\n\n49:52.240 --> 49:57.240\n So institutions role should be transparent and honest\n\n49:57.400 --> 50:01.320\n with the sins of its members and of itself.\n\n50:01.320 --> 50:02.320\n Sure, yeah.\n\n50:02.320 --> 50:07.320\n So maybe you can speak to the fact as a priest, a bishop,\n\n50:09.840 --> 50:14.840\n as part of Catholicism, you're not allowed to marry,\n\n50:15.360 --> 50:20.360\n not allowed to have sex, you're sworn to celibacy.\n\n50:22.360 --> 50:25.080\n What is behind that idea?\n\n50:25.080 --> 50:28.080\n What is the sort of, we've talked about some broad stroke\n\n50:28.080 --> 50:33.080\n ideas of love, what's behind the idea of celibacy?\n\n50:33.520 --> 50:34.520\n And that's a good way to get at it.\n\n50:34.520 --> 50:35.760\n It's a path of love.\n\n50:35.760 --> 50:39.320\n So the church is always in favor of inculcating love.\n\n50:39.320 --> 50:42.380\n Marriage is a path of love, but so is celibacy.\n\n50:43.300 --> 50:46.520\n Saint Paul talks about someone who is preoccupied\n\n50:46.520 --> 50:48.640\n with the things of this world and family\n\n50:48.640 --> 50:50.720\n and those who are free from that\n\n50:50.720 --> 50:53.440\n are freer for doing the work of God.\n\n50:53.440 --> 50:56.320\n So that's kind of a pragmatic justification for celibacy.\n\n50:56.320 --> 50:59.120\n And we still, I think, take that seriously.\n\n50:59.120 --> 50:59.960\n I look at my own life.\n\n50:59.960 --> 51:03.040\n I mean, celibacy has enabled me to do all kinds of things\n\n51:03.040 --> 51:07.940\n and go places and minister in a way that I could not\n\n51:07.940 --> 51:09.360\n if I had been married.\n\n51:09.360 --> 51:11.260\n So I get it, I get the pragmatic side.\n\n51:11.260 --> 51:14.540\n But I'm more interested in the sort of mystical side of it.\n\n51:17.320 --> 51:18.960\n Remember Jesus was challenged about the person\n\n51:18.960 --> 51:22.520\n who had a whole series of husbands and then they all died.\n\n51:22.520 --> 51:26.760\n And so in heaven, which husband will the wife have?\n\n51:26.760 --> 51:30.440\n And his answer is, in heaven, people don't marry\n\n51:30.440 --> 51:31.520\n and they're not given in marriage.\n\n51:31.520 --> 51:34.360\n There's a higher way of love.\n\n51:34.360 --> 51:35.780\n It's a more radical way of love.\n\n51:35.780 --> 51:37.560\n It's not tied to a particular,\n\n51:37.560 --> 51:40.880\n but I think through God is tied to everybody.\n\n51:40.880 --> 51:42.400\n The celibate, and this has been\n\n51:42.400 --> 51:45.080\n to the beginning of the church, not as a law,\n\n51:45.080 --> 51:46.600\n but there were celibates\n\n51:46.600 --> 51:48.080\n from the very beginning of the church,\n\n51:48.080 --> 51:50.480\n including Jesus, of course, and Paul.\n\n51:50.480 --> 51:54.880\n They sense something, that that way of living\n\n51:55.760 --> 51:58.780\n mystically anticipates the way we'll love in heaven.\n\n51:58.780 --> 52:02.560\n It's a sign even now within this world\n\n52:02.560 --> 52:04.800\n of how we will all love in heaven.\n\n52:04.800 --> 52:08.640\n So in that way, it's a bit like pacifists.\n\n52:10.120 --> 52:12.400\n I'm glad there are pacifists in the church.\n\n52:12.400 --> 52:17.400\n And I've known some very powerful witnesses to pacifism.\n\n52:17.400 --> 52:22.400\n I'm glad they're pacifists because they witness even now\n\n52:22.420 --> 52:25.340\n to how we will be in heaven when every tear is wiped away\n\n52:25.340 --> 52:26.940\n and we beat our swords into plowshares\n\n52:26.940 --> 52:29.980\n and heaven's a place of radical peace,\n\n52:29.980 --> 52:32.060\n that some people even now live it.\n\n52:32.060 --> 52:35.100\n At the same time, I'm glad not everyone's a pacifist\n\n52:35.100 --> 52:38.260\n because I would hold with the church to just war theory\n\n52:38.260 --> 52:42.140\n that sometimes all we can do in this finite world\n\n52:42.140 --> 52:45.580\n is to fight manifest wickedness.\n\n52:45.580 --> 52:46.580\n So.\n\n52:46.580 --> 52:48.700\n And just in the same way there's just sex?\n\n52:49.660 --> 52:51.740\n Well, no, right, I'm glad there are celibates,\n\n52:51.740 --> 52:53.620\n but I'm glad not everyone's a celibate.\n\n52:53.620 --> 52:54.440\n I wouldn't want that.\n\n52:54.440 --> 52:58.860\n I mean, because married love is a marvelous expression\n\n52:58.860 --> 52:59.760\n of the divine love.\n\n52:59.760 --> 53:01.980\n So that's why it's good there are some.\n\n53:01.980 --> 53:03.740\n And it's always been a small number.\n\n53:03.740 --> 53:06.500\n The actual experience of it, would you,\n\n53:07.540 --> 53:10.780\n the spiritual nature of it, is it similar to fasting?\n\n53:10.780 --> 53:15.000\n So I've been enjoying fasting recently, so not eating.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:16.120\n Yeah.\n\n53:16.120 --> 53:18.860\n For several days, that kind of stuff.\n\n53:18.860 --> 53:21.780\n And that somehow brings you even deeper.\n\n53:21.780 --> 53:24.060\n I'm in general in love with everything,\n\n53:24.060 --> 53:25.100\n with nature and everything.\n\n53:25.100 --> 53:26.700\n I see the beauty in the world.\n\n53:26.700 --> 53:29.660\n But there's a greater intensity to that\n\n53:29.660 --> 53:31.640\n when you're fasting, for example.\n\n53:31.640 --> 53:34.240\n Yeah, I might use the language of sublimation\n\n53:34.240 --> 53:36.140\n or redirection of energy and all that.\n\n53:37.100 --> 53:38.700\n I think that's true.\n\n53:38.700 --> 53:43.700\n There's a certain sublimation of energies into prayer,\n\n53:43.700 --> 53:48.700\n into mysticism, into ministry, a redirection of energies.\n\n53:50.540 --> 53:52.740\n So it's meant to be life enhancing.\n\n53:52.740 --> 53:53.860\n The same way fasting is.\n\n53:53.860 --> 53:55.500\n It's meant ultimately to be life enhancing\n\n53:55.500 --> 53:57.340\n and make you healthier and happier.\n\n53:57.340 --> 54:00.060\n So celibacy is a path of love.\n\n54:00.060 --> 54:01.940\n And I think it does involve a certain redirection\n\n54:01.940 --> 54:03.460\n of energies, I'd say that.\n\n54:03.460 --> 54:08.460\n Don't you think, do you think it's a heavy burden\n\n54:08.900 --> 54:11.100\n for some humans to bear?\n\n54:11.100 --> 54:11.940\n Sure.\n\n54:11.940 --> 54:12.760\n For some priests to bear?\n\n54:12.760 --> 54:13.600\n Sure.\n\n54:13.600 --> 54:18.460\n I'm just saying, given the sexual abuse scandal,\n\n54:19.900 --> 54:22.260\n is that the thing that breaks humans?\n\n54:22.260 --> 54:24.260\n No, I wouldn't tie that to celibacy.\n\n54:24.260 --> 54:27.380\n And that's been demonstrated over and over again.\n\n54:27.380 --> 54:28.740\n There's a priest named Andrew Greeley\n\n54:28.740 --> 54:30.820\n who was a priest from my home diocese of Chicago.\n\n54:30.820 --> 54:32.980\n And Andy did a lot of research,\n\n54:32.980 --> 54:34.220\n he was a sociologist of religion,\n\n54:34.220 --> 54:36.120\n did a lot of research into that very question.\n\n54:36.120 --> 54:37.780\n And there really is not a correlation\n\n54:37.780 --> 54:40.940\n between celibacy per se and the sexual abuse\n\n54:40.940 --> 54:42.760\n of children or of anybody.\n\n54:42.760 --> 54:44.460\n So I wouldn't make that correlation.\n\n54:44.460 --> 54:47.320\n So bad people, sinful people are going to do\n\n54:47.320 --> 54:48.540\n what they're going to do.\n\n54:48.540 --> 54:51.460\n I think people who have a tendency toward\n\n54:52.860 --> 54:55.820\n abusing children sexually are drawn to situations\n\n54:55.820 --> 54:58.540\n where they get ready access to kids\n\n54:58.540 --> 55:00.740\n and they get institutional cover.\n\n55:00.740 --> 55:03.220\n So that's the only thing that can go through the list\n\n55:03.220 --> 55:06.020\n from sports and Boy Scouts, et cetera.\n\n55:06.020 --> 55:08.000\n And that's been proven again and again.\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:09.620\n So I would tie it more to that.\n\n55:09.620 --> 55:11.140\n I wouldn't tie it to celibacy.\n\n55:11.140 --> 55:13.420\n So the challenge of course is all kinds of,\n\n55:13.420 --> 55:15.300\n you said institutional cover,\n\n55:15.300 --> 55:17.820\n there's all kinds of institutions that cover\n\n55:17.820 --> 55:22.740\n for people that do evil onto the world,\n\n55:22.740 --> 55:25.540\n that do sinful things onto the world.\n\n55:25.540 --> 55:27.180\n But there's something about the church\n\n55:27.180 --> 55:32.180\n which is, as an organism, is supposed to be an embodiment\n\n55:32.860 --> 55:35.800\n of good in this world, of love in this world.\n\n55:35.800 --> 55:39.300\n And it breaks people's hearts to see this kind of,\n\n55:39.300 --> 55:42.940\n even a small amount, this kind of thing happen\n\n55:42.940 --> 55:43.780\n within the church.\n\n55:43.780 --> 55:46.940\n It wakes you up to the cruelty, the absurdity\n\n55:46.940 --> 55:48.340\n of the world sometimes.\n\n55:48.340 --> 55:53.340\n Like it's back to the question of why do bad things\n\n55:54.620 --> 55:56.740\n happen to good people?\n\n55:56.740 --> 56:00.060\n Why does God allow this kind of thing to happen?\n\n56:00.060 --> 56:02.540\n And sort of maybe an unanswerable question.\n\n56:02.540 --> 56:04.220\n Do you have an answer to that question?\n\n56:04.220 --> 56:08.000\n I can gesture toward it using rather abstract language,\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.140\n which is true enough,\n\n56:10.140 --> 56:12.860\n it's completely emotionally unsatisfying,\n\n56:12.860 --> 56:15.420\n but it's naming it truthfully enough.\n\n56:15.420 --> 56:16.920\n And it goes back to Augustine,\n\n56:16.920 --> 56:21.920\n which is God permits evil to bring about a greater good.\n\n56:24.060 --> 56:25.860\n Now again, I know how unsatisfying\n\n56:25.860 --> 56:29.140\n that sort of spare, austere language can sound,\n\n56:29.140 --> 56:32.340\n but it gets us off the horns of a dilemma.\n\n56:32.340 --> 56:34.860\n Aquinas, when he lays out a question,\n\n56:34.860 --> 56:36.980\n he always has the objections first.\n\n56:36.980 --> 56:38.380\n So is there a God?\n\n56:38.380 --> 56:40.860\n Well, objection one, objection two, objection three.\n\n56:40.860 --> 56:43.100\n And he's really, you talk about steel manning\n\n56:43.100 --> 56:45.100\n and argument, Aquinas is great at that.\n\n56:46.300 --> 56:49.340\n One of the really steel manned arguments,\n\n56:49.340 --> 56:51.460\n is that the right grammatical form?\n\n56:51.460 --> 56:53.900\n What's the past participle of the steel man?\n\n56:55.020 --> 56:58.940\n But one of the best arguments, he formulates it this way.\n\n57:00.940 --> 57:03.400\n If one of two contraries be infinite,\n\n57:03.400 --> 57:05.400\n the other would be altogether destroyed.\n\n57:05.400 --> 57:08.480\n And as an example from his medieval physics,\n\n57:08.480 --> 57:09.780\n he goes, if there were an infinite heat,\n\n57:09.780 --> 57:11.520\n there'd be no cold, right?\n\n57:11.520 --> 57:14.640\n But God is described as infinitely good.\n\n57:15.820 --> 57:18.600\n Therefore, if God exists, there should be no evil.\n\n57:18.600 --> 57:20.040\n But there is evil.\n\n57:20.040 --> 57:22.040\n Therefore, God does not exist.\n\n57:22.040 --> 57:23.440\n That's a darn good argument.\n\n57:23.440 --> 57:25.120\n That's a really persuasive argument.\n\n57:25.120 --> 57:27.900\n And I think, I've done this for a long time\n\n57:27.900 --> 57:31.760\n in apologetics and in sort of higher philosophy,\n\n57:31.760 --> 57:33.600\n that's the best argument against God.\n\n57:33.600 --> 57:36.200\n But here's something, before I press head with it,\n\n57:36.200 --> 57:37.720\n something I find really interesting.\n\n57:37.720 --> 57:40.600\n I think the three best arguments against God\n\n57:40.600 --> 57:43.480\n all come from within the religious tradition.\n\n57:43.480 --> 57:45.160\n Namely, the book of Job.\n\n57:46.880 --> 57:48.880\n So Job, he's great.\n\n57:48.880 --> 57:50.240\n I mean, he's a great guy.\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:51.560\n He does everything right.\n\n57:51.560 --> 57:53.560\n He's God's great servant,\n\n57:53.560 --> 57:57.360\n and he's punished in every possible way.\n\n57:57.360 --> 57:59.720\n He has every possible suffering.\n\n57:59.720 --> 58:01.840\n Aquinas's argument from the Summa,\n\n58:01.840 --> 58:06.080\n from the Summa, and then to your friend and mine, Dostoevsky.\n\n58:06.080 --> 58:10.160\n I think in the Brothers Karamazov, Ivan's argument,\n\n58:10.160 --> 58:13.160\n when he's trying to wreck the faith of Alyosha.\n\n58:13.160 --> 58:18.160\n And these examples drawn, they think, from Dostoevsky,\n\n58:18.200 --> 58:20.560\n from the headlines of his own time,\n\n58:20.560 --> 58:24.480\n of the most abject cruelty to children,\n\n58:24.480 --> 58:27.920\n like an innocent child being made to suffer.\n\n58:27.920 --> 58:32.040\n How in God's name could that happen\n\n58:32.040 --> 58:34.400\n if God exists and he's all good?\n\n58:34.400 --> 58:36.920\n So I get it, but see, the book of Job,\n\n58:36.920 --> 58:38.360\n Thomas Aquinas, Dostoevsky,\n\n58:38.360 --> 58:41.000\n these are all profoundly believing people.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.240\n It's like when I hear Stephen Fry,\n\n58:43.240 --> 58:46.400\n the famously atheist writer,\n\n58:46.400 --> 58:50.200\n he will bring out this argument with great authority.\n\n58:50.200 --> 58:53.480\n He does, of children with bone cancer\n\n58:53.480 --> 58:55.680\n and worms that go into the eyes of children\n\n58:55.680 --> 58:57.240\n and blind them before they kill them.\n\n58:57.240 --> 59:01.720\n And, but he's been preceded by the author of Job,\n\n59:01.720 --> 59:05.960\n Thomas Aquinas and Dostoevsky, who stood right,\n\n59:05.960 --> 59:08.880\n think of Job, in the whirlwind.\n\n59:08.880 --> 59:12.080\n He stands there in the whirlwind, you know?\n\n59:12.080 --> 59:15.360\n So you can't blame the Christian tradition\n\n59:15.360 --> 59:17.440\n for not dealing with this problem,\n\n59:17.440 --> 59:20.200\n for brushing it under the carpet.\n\n59:20.200 --> 59:23.520\n I mean, it has stood in the whirlwind of this problem.\n\n59:23.520 --> 59:25.560\n It's still a difficult problem to deal with,\n\n59:25.560 --> 59:27.960\n that there's all this cruelty of the world.\n\n59:29.760 --> 59:31.920\n There's a lot of example through history,\n\n59:31.920 --> 59:36.800\n just in my own family history with the Soviet Union,\n\n59:36.800 --> 59:41.800\n with Stalin, the atrocities that Stalin has brought onto\n\n59:45.480 --> 59:47.000\n the people of the Soviet Union\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:51.040\n throughout the 20th century is nearly immeasurable.\n\n59:51.040 --> 59:56.040\n And yet, when you look at the entirety of human history,\n\n59:57.120 --> 59:59.840\n you will see progress, not just the Soviet Union,\n\n59:59.840 --> 1:00:01.440\n but the entirety of the civilization\n\n1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:02.960\n throughout the 20th century,\n\n1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:04.840\n and Stalin has a role to play.\n\n1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:08.880\n There's a dark aspect to,\n\n1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:13.880\n somehow evil helps us make progress.\n\n1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:18.440\n And I don't know how to put that in the calculation.\n\n1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:21.800\n It's a, I don't, you know, on the local scale,\n\n1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:23.680\n I want to alleviate suffering.\n\n1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:28.680\n I'm probably lean, heavily lean pacifist.\n\n1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:31.400\n Not out of weakness, but out of strength,\n\n1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:36.400\n but man, it does seem that history is sprinkled with evil,\n\n1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:41.320\n and that evil does somehow nudge us towards good.\n\n1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:44.160\n Yes, sometimes we can see it,\n\n1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:46.560\n and that's where the idea comes from,\n\n1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:49.840\n that evil's permitted to bring about some greater good,\n\n1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:52.320\n and we can sometimes really see it.\n\n1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:54.880\n Can we always see it?\n\n1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:55.720\n No.\n\n1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.320\n In fact, typically we don't see it,\n\n1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.160\n but now you bring another factor into this,\n\n1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:02.840\n which is the difference between our minds and God's mind.\n\n1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:04.560\n So our minds, I mean, look, even,\n\n1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:06.120\n they're remarkably capacious,\n\n1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:11.120\n but they take in a tiny, tiny, tiny swath of space and time,\n\n1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:13.880\n and even our eyes kind of take in\n\n1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:15.000\n so much of the light spectrum,\n\n1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.120\n and these little ape sensorium that we have\n\n1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.600\n that could just take in a little tiny bit of reality, really.\n\n1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:25.440\n How are we ever in a position to say,\n\n1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:26.720\n oh no, there's no possible good\n\n1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:28.160\n that would ever come from that?\n\n1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:32.600\n Even the greatest evil that Dostoevsky can conjure up,\n\n1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:37.600\n and Stephen Fry, still, how could we have the arrogance\n\n1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:41.280\n to say, I know there's no good\n\n1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:42.480\n that could ever come from that.\n\n1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:45.640\n I know there's no morally justifiable reason\n\n1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:47.280\n why God would ever permit that,\n\n1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.120\n because I think that's hubris to the nth degree\n\n1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:51.760\n for us to say that,\n\n1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:54.200\n and that's the assumption behind this claim\n\n1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:57.600\n that God can permit evil to bring about a greater good.\n\n1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:00.040\n Now, God understands it,\n\n1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:04.720\n but we're like little kids, like a four year old,\n\n1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:06.240\n and their parents make a decision,\n\n1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:08.360\n and we say, what in the, why in the world\n\n1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:09.560\n would you do this to me?\n\n1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:12.240\n This is my pastoral experience.\n\n1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.320\n Years ago, there was a young father,\n\n1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:16.440\n and his son was like three or something,\n\n1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:18.560\n and he was in the hospital for something,\n\n1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:19.400\n I forgot what it was,\n\n1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:21.400\n but he had to undergo surgery, right?\n\n1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.640\n So after the surgery, he's in great pain,\n\n1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:25.600\n this poor kid, this three year old kid,\n\n1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.800\n and the dad was there with him, holding his hand,\n\n1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:31.680\n and the son, this is what the father told me,\n\n1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:35.600\n he said, he's looking at me like, what gives here?\n\n1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:37.800\n I mean, why would you, you love me,\n\n1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:40.160\n I've always assumed that,\n\n1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:42.120\n and yet you're presiding over this somehow,\n\n1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:43.760\n you're approving of this,\n\n1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:46.480\n and doing nothing to get me out of it, right?\n\n1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:48.400\n And he said, the kid couldn't articulate that,\n\n1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.560\n but his eyes did, and the father said,\n\n1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:52.600\n it was just killing me,\n\n1:02:52.600 --> 1:02:55.680\n because I knew I couldn't explain it to him.\n\n1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:58.200\n And it's true, I mean, he could vaguely gesture toward,\n\n1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:00.040\n but the kid didn't understand surgery,\n\n1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:02.160\n and cutting his body, and taking things out of it,\n\n1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:04.680\n and that this was gonna make him much better\n\n1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:06.680\n in the long run, but I remember thinking,\n\n1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:08.880\n that's a great metaphor for us vis a vis God,\n\n1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:11.120\n is here's God, infinitely loving God,\n\n1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:13.400\n who's with us all the time, and we say,\n\n1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:14.720\n what are you doing?\n\n1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:17.160\n Why aren't you taking this away from me?\n\n1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:20.040\n And the answer, I mean, ultimately is trust,\n\n1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:24.040\n trust me, trust me, surrender to me.\n\n1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:25.480\n And when we don't, that's,\n\n1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:29.080\n we get in trouble with the old pride,\n\n1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:31.320\n and the hubris, and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:33.440\n Yeah, no, but trust me when I tell you,\n\n1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.160\n I mean, I completely get it in my own life,\n\n1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:38.960\n and as a priest, you're dealing with suffering all the time,\n\n1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:41.440\n with people in pain all the time.\n\n1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.400\n I remember as a young priest,\n\n1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:47.120\n there was a policeman in our parish,\n\n1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:50.440\n so he had a gun, and inexplicably,\n\n1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:52.800\n no one had any clue.\n\n1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:55.480\n He got up one night, shot his son to death,\n\n1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:57.080\n and then shot himself.\n\n1:03:57.080 --> 1:03:58.240\n This is my parish.\n\n1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:01.280\n So I went to the wake, I remember, I show up,\n\n1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:04.720\n and I'm this young, 27 year old goofball priest,\n\n1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:07.080\n and I roll my collar around, and I walk in,\n\n1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:09.000\n and there were two coffins,\n\n1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.200\n the two coffins in the room,\n\n1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.760\n there's the son and the father.\n\n1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:16.760\n And the mother was there, and she went like this to me.\n\n1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:21.760\n She saw me, okay, you're the religious guy here, what?\n\n1:04:21.760 --> 1:04:26.080\n And just by instinct, I went like that too.\n\n1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:29.920\n I went like, I don't know what to tell, I can't,\n\n1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:32.240\n I don't have an answer for you.\n\n1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:34.520\n But I was there,\n\n1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:36.040\n and I'm not saying to pat myself on the back,\n\n1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:38.800\n this is, that's where the church goes,\n\n1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:41.760\n because Jesus went there.\n\n1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:44.920\n Now we're gesturing toward a more theological response.\n\n1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:47.120\n The first one's more austerely philosophical,\n\n1:04:47.120 --> 1:04:49.500\n God permits evil to bring about a good.\n\n1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:52.480\n But the theological response is, that's where Christ went,\n\n1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:54.040\n is he went all the way down.\n\n1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:56.720\n He went all the way down into our suffering.\n\n1:04:56.720 --> 1:05:01.720\n And see the cross as the limit case of evil,\n\n1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:06.720\n humiliation and cruelty and institutional injustice\n\n1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:11.160\n and psychological suffering and spiritual suffering\n\n1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:13.760\n and death, it's all there.\n\n1:05:13.760 --> 1:05:16.000\n And that's where the Son of God went.\n\n1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.360\n And I would say that's why, as a priest, I went there.\n\n1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:22.100\n That's my job, is to go to those places.\n\n1:05:22.100 --> 1:05:26.160\n So that's the ultimate answer to the problem.\n\n1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:30.840\n So there is, we can't comprehend it,\n\n1:05:30.840 --> 1:05:34.040\n but there is meaning to the suffering and the injustice.\n\n1:05:34.040 --> 1:05:37.320\n We trust it because we know on other grounds\n\n1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:38.160\n of God's existence.\n\n1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:39.720\n See, I would resist the claim that,\n\n1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:42.440\n well, this is such a knockdown argument,\n\n1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.720\n so now we know there is no God.\n\n1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:45.360\n I would say, no, there are all kinds\n\n1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:46.960\n of other rational warrants for God.\n\n1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:49.680\n And so I know that God exists.\n\n1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:51.360\n I know that God is infinite love,\n\n1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:54.040\n and now I gotta square that with this experience.\n\n1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:58.160\n And the way I do that is by a trusting confidence\n\n1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:01.160\n that God knows what he's about.\n\n1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:03.600\n Again, I know how inadequate that always seems\n\n1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.680\n to anyone who's suffering, including myself,\n\n1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:07.660\n when I'm in great suffering.\n\n1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:09.940\n But I think that's the best that we've done\n\n1:06:09.940 --> 1:06:11.280\n in the great tradition.\n\n1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:16.160\n So if you were to steel man the case against God\n\n1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:20.160\n or the existence of God, you find the most convincing\n\n1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:23.400\n argument is there's evil in the world,\n\n1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:24.560\n therefore there's no God.\n\n1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:25.600\n There's too much of it.\n\n1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.000\n If I were to steel man that argument,\n\n1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:28.320\n I'd do what Stephen Fry does.\n\n1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:30.180\n I would do what Dostoevsky's Ivan does.\n\n1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:31.500\n I would do exactly that.\n\n1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:34.200\n I would say there's just too much.\n\n1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:37.300\n And then if you wanna keep pressing it, animal suffering.\n\n1:06:37.300 --> 1:06:39.000\n So we talk about human suffering,\n\n1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:42.880\n but the suffering of animals over the eons and so on,\n\n1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:46.560\n isn't there just too much suffering\n\n1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:49.320\n to be reconciled with an infinitely good God?\n\n1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:51.000\n And that's, again, Thomas Aquinas.\n\n1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:55.040\n I've just used his very steel man argument.\n\n1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:57.280\n You mentioned that, again, on Reddit,\n\n1:06:57.280 --> 1:07:02.080\n somebody asked who your favorite communicator\n\n1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:06.880\n of atheist ideas was, and you mentioned Christopher Hitchens.\n\n1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:11.880\n Are there other ideas for atheism\n\n1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.040\n that you find particularly challenging?\n\n1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:18.080\n Well, that's the one, is the problem of evil.\n\n1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:19.760\n The other objection in Aquinas,\n\n1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:22.420\n which has a lot of contemporary resonance,\n\n1:07:22.420 --> 1:07:26.400\n is can't we just explain everything through natural causes?\n\n1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:28.040\n Why would you have to invoke a cause\n\n1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:30.480\n beyond the causes in the world?\n\n1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.720\n So as I'm trying to explain, let's say for Aquinas,\n\n1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:37.080\n motion, causality, finality,\n\n1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:39.260\n can I just do that with natural causes?\n\n1:07:39.260 --> 1:07:41.520\n Wouldn't that suffice to explain it?\n\n1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:44.840\n So I get like when naturalists are speaking\n\n1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:46.520\n or people that are pure materialists,\n\n1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:49.040\n they'll just say, no, that's perfectly adequate.\n\n1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:52.440\n A scientific account of reality is utterly adequate\n\n1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:54.260\n to our experience.\n\n1:07:55.140 --> 1:07:56.860\n So I would steel man that and say,\n\n1:07:56.860 --> 1:07:59.680\n well, show me why we need something more.\n\n1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:02.680\n And to do that, you gotta get out of Plato's cave,\n\n1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:03.720\n it seems to me.\n\n1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:06.240\n Because my objection to naturalism\n\n1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:12.160\n is it's staying within the realm\n\n1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:15.920\n of the immediately empirically observable\n\n1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:17.400\n and making the mistake of saying\n\n1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:19.760\n that's all there is to being.\n\n1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:22.840\n That's all there is that needs to be explained.\n\n1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:25.640\n And long before we get to religion,\n\n1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:27.400\n just stay with Plato.\n\n1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:28.840\n The first step out of the cave,\n\n1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:31.080\n if you combine it now with the parable of the line,\n\n1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:33.160\n is mathematical objects.\n\n1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:36.480\n And I'm with those, the many people that would say,\n\n1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:39.760\n mathematics is an experience of the immaterial.\n\n1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:42.860\n I've stepped out of a merely empirical,\n\n1:08:42.860 --> 1:08:45.020\n physical, naturalistic world.\n\n1:08:45.020 --> 1:08:48.320\n The minute I understand a pure number\n\n1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:52.120\n or a pure equation or a pure mathematical relationship,\n\n1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:55.400\n which would obtain in any possible world,\n\n1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:57.880\n which are not tied to space and time,\n\n1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:01.400\n that's a first step out of the cave.\n\n1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:05.560\n And then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections.\n\n1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:07.040\n For example, in the nature of being.\n\n1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:08.880\n I mean, so I could talk about this thing\n\n1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:10.720\n as a physical object and I can analyze it\n\n1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:13.800\n at all kinds of levels and follow all the scientists\n\n1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:16.560\n up and down through this thing, and fine, fine.\n\n1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:17.960\n But I'm still in Plato's cave.\n\n1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:20.720\n I'm still looking at the flickering images on the wall.\n\n1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:24.200\n But when I step out of that into the mathematical realm,\n\n1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:28.000\n I have entered a different realm of being, seems to me.\n\n1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.360\n Do you think it's possible for the cave to expand\n\n1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:32.900\n so large that it encompasses the whole world?\n\n1:09:32.900 --> 1:09:37.900\n Meaning, is it possible that we're just clueless right now\n\n1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:41.600\n in terms of, scientifically speaking,\n\n1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:45.240\n with most of the world we haven't figured out yet?\n\n1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:49.080\n But do you think it's possible through science to know God,\n\n1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:50.540\n to look outside the world?\n\n1:09:50.540 --> 1:09:52.080\n So it's fundamentally the limit\n\n1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:54.520\n of the empirical scientific method,\n\n1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:57.880\n is that we can't know some of these very big questions.\n\n1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:00.120\n No, I'm not a scientist,\n\n1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:02.280\n and I was never all that good at science.\n\n1:10:02.280 --> 1:10:03.640\n I was more of a humanities guy.\n\n1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:06.660\n But I love and respect the sciences, but I hate scientism.\n\n1:10:06.660 --> 1:10:10.480\n And scientism is rampant today, with especially young people.\n\n1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:11.840\n The reduction of all knowledge\n\n1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:13.200\n to the scientific form of knowledge.\n\n1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:16.600\n And I'm a vehement opponent of that.\n\n1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:18.840\n There are dimensions of being that are not capturable\n\n1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.480\n through a scientific method of mere observation,\n\n1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:24.220\n hypothesis formation, experimentation, et cetera.\n\n1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:26.880\n As great as that is, as wonderful as that is,\n\n1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:29.400\n but it's still, I think, within Plato's cave.\n\n1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:31.040\n And that's not to say it's not real.\n\n1:10:31.040 --> 1:10:34.200\n It's just at a relatively low level of reality.\n\n1:10:34.200 --> 1:10:35.500\n You step out of Plato's cave\n\n1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:37.960\n when you go into pure mathematics.\n\n1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:38.960\n That's why, you know that article,\n\n1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:40.380\n I just came across it recently,\n\n1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:42.600\n and discovered this whole literature around it,\n\n1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:44.780\n is Eugene Wigner's article, 1960,\n\n1:10:44.780 --> 1:10:49.540\n called the unreasonable applicability of mathematics\n\n1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:50.600\n to the physical sciences.\n\n1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:51.560\n I think that's the title of it.\n\n1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:53.920\n Or effectiveness or something like that, yeah.\n\n1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:56.080\n But what's so cool is that he's not a religious man.\n\n1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:57.960\n He was kind of a secular Jew.\n\n1:10:57.960 --> 1:10:59.720\n But yet he uses the word miracle\n\n1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:01.680\n like eight times in that article.\n\n1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:03.600\n Because he just is so impressed by the fact\n\n1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:08.600\n that high, complex mathematics describes so accurately\n\n1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:11.580\n the physical world and can be used to create things\n\n1:11:11.580 --> 1:11:13.020\n and to manipulate.\n\n1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:15.200\n And why should that be true?\n\n1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:18.320\n That there's something very weirdly mysterious\n\n1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:19.900\n about that relationship.\n\n1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:21.620\n And I would say it's because you stepped\n\n1:11:21.620 --> 1:11:23.620\n into a higher order of being,\n\n1:11:23.620 --> 1:11:26.060\n which is inclusive of a lower level being.\n\n1:11:26.060 --> 1:11:27.740\n That's the Platonic approach,\n\n1:11:27.740 --> 1:11:30.060\n is that as you move, now I'm going to a different metaphor,\n\n1:11:30.060 --> 1:11:31.180\n you move to higher levels,\n\n1:11:31.180 --> 1:11:33.180\n they're inclusive of the lower levels.\n\n1:11:33.180 --> 1:11:35.380\n Yeah, there's some magic there\n\n1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:38.020\n that seems to, at least in our current understanding\n\n1:11:38.020 --> 1:11:42.340\n of science, to be not quite capturable.\n\n1:11:42.340 --> 1:11:45.260\n Even consciousness, the idea of consciousness.\n\n1:11:45.260 --> 1:11:46.780\n Can I ask you, where do you think\n\n1:11:46.780 --> 1:11:48.060\n the laws of nature come from?\n\n1:11:48.060 --> 1:11:49.900\n So, I mean, sort of the Vigner question,\n\n1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:54.900\n where does the deep mathematical structure\n\n1:11:55.300 --> 1:11:56.280\n of things come from?\n\n1:11:56.280 --> 1:11:57.340\n How do you explain that?\n\n1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:00.740\n The mathematical structure or the fact\n\n1:12:00.740 --> 1:12:04.340\n that the structure is somehow pleasing and beautiful.\n\n1:12:04.340 --> 1:12:07.020\n Because those are two different.\n\n1:12:07.020 --> 1:12:08.060\n Well, do the first one first.\n\n1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:09.140\n I'm just curious to tell you,\n\n1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:11.020\n where do you think it comes from?\n\n1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:13.260\n I tend to believe, even in terms of physics,\n\n1:12:13.260 --> 1:12:15.200\n we don't really know what's going on.\n\n1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:18.620\n There's so, so, so much more to be discovered.\n\n1:12:18.620 --> 1:12:21.060\n We're walking around in the dark\n\n1:12:21.060 --> 1:12:23.580\n trying to figure out a little puzzles here and there,\n\n1:12:23.580 --> 1:12:25.620\n and we're patting ourselves on the back\n\n1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:28.080\n and how many puzzles we've discovered so far.\n\n1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:30.180\n Even Gadot's incompleteness theorem,\n\n1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:32.020\n what are the limits of mathematics,\n\n1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:33.060\n axiomatic systems?\n\n1:12:33.060 --> 1:12:37.300\n I don't know what is the purpose of mathematics,\n\n1:12:37.300 --> 1:12:38.880\n what is the power of mathematics?\n\n1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:43.880\n Is it just a useful tool to study the world around us,\n\n1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:49.280\n or is it something deeper that we're just discovering?\n\n1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:53.500\n All I know from my emotional perspective,\n\n1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:57.020\n now I am an engineer, I'm a robotics AI person,\n\n1:12:57.020 --> 1:12:58.220\n from an emotional perspective,\n\n1:12:58.220 --> 1:12:59.980\n I just find the whole thing beautiful.\n\n1:12:59.980 --> 1:13:01.740\n Yeah, but that's really cool to me.\n\n1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:03.900\n That's a very interesting clue.\n\n1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:05.460\n See, one of the arguments for God\n\n1:13:05.460 --> 1:13:08.420\n is based on the intelligibility of the world.\n\n1:13:08.420 --> 1:13:10.540\n It's like Wigner, it's a very peculiar fact,\n\n1:13:10.540 --> 1:13:13.260\n it seems to me, that the world is so radically intelligible.\n\n1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:14.500\n Why should that be true?\n\n1:13:14.500 --> 1:13:15.980\n Why should it be the case\n\n1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:18.900\n that being has this intelligible structure to it?\n\n1:13:18.900 --> 1:13:21.660\n So it corresponds to an inquiring mind.\n\n1:13:21.660 --> 1:13:25.500\n So Aquinas can say that the intelligible in act\n\n1:13:25.500 --> 1:13:27.340\n is the intellect in act.\n\n1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:29.660\n Meaning there's some deep correspondence\n\n1:13:29.660 --> 1:13:32.820\n between this and that.\n\n1:13:32.820 --> 1:13:34.620\n And I'm with Wigner.\n\n1:13:34.620 --> 1:13:36.620\n That's, I think, really weird\n\n1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:39.060\n and unreasonable and strange.\n\n1:13:39.060 --> 1:13:44.060\n Now, my answer is, because the creator of the universe\n\n1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:48.580\n is a great mind and has stamped the world\n\n1:13:48.580 --> 1:13:50.420\n with intelligibility.\n\n1:13:50.420 --> 1:13:52.360\n In the beginning was the Word, right?\n\n1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:53.340\n And the Word was with God,\n\n1:13:53.340 --> 1:13:55.540\n and all things came to be through the Word.\n\n1:13:56.500 --> 1:13:58.580\n We shouldn't picture that so much.\n\n1:13:58.580 --> 1:14:00.940\n It's gesturing in this very powerful direction.\n\n1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:04.620\n There's an intelligence that has imbued the world\n\n1:14:04.620 --> 1:14:05.840\n with intelligibility.\n\n1:14:07.500 --> 1:14:09.980\n And we discover that, you know?\n\n1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:11.420\n There's something about the simplicity\n\n1:14:11.420 --> 1:14:12.880\n of the way the world works,\n\n1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:15.580\n that's where the beauty comes from.\n\n1:14:15.580 --> 1:14:18.620\n And yes, there's something profound to the mechanism,\n\n1:14:18.620 --> 1:14:23.220\n whatever that is, God, that brought that to be.\n\n1:14:23.220 --> 1:14:25.000\n That thought it into being.\n\n1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.460\n That the world has been,\n\n1:14:26.460 --> 1:14:28.640\n and the Bible says that God said,\n\n1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:29.900\n \"'Let there be light,' and there was light.\"\n\n1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.620\n God said, well, again, we don't literalize the poetry,\n\n1:14:32.620 --> 1:14:37.060\n but it's very rich that God spoke the world into being.\n\n1:14:37.060 --> 1:14:40.580\n So that means it's been imbued with intelligibility\n\n1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:41.560\n from the beginning.\n\n1:14:42.580 --> 1:14:44.700\n They say that the condition for the possibility\n\n1:14:44.700 --> 1:14:46.840\n of the Western physical sciences\n\n1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:49.020\n was a basically Christian idea,\n\n1:14:49.020 --> 1:14:51.500\n namely that the world is not God.\n\n1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:54.140\n Therefore, I can analyze it, experiment upon it.\n\n1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:55.700\n I don't divinize it.\n\n1:14:55.700 --> 1:14:57.780\n I don't have a mystical relation to the world.\n\n1:14:57.780 --> 1:14:59.020\n It's not God.\n\n1:14:59.020 --> 1:15:01.200\n But secondly, that it's absolutely\n\n1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:03.400\n in every nook and cranny intelligible.\n\n1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:06.780\n And those two ideas are correlated to the idea of creation.\n\n1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:09.820\n So it's been created, it's not God, it's other than God,\n\n1:15:09.820 --> 1:15:13.500\n but yet it's touched in every dimension by God's mind.\n\n1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:15.500\n And when those two things are in place,\n\n1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:17.240\n the sciences get underway.\n\n1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:19.660\n You know, I don't worship the world anymore,\n\n1:15:19.660 --> 1:15:22.440\n but I'm also utterly confident I can come to know it.\n\n1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:24.620\n And those are theological ideas.\n\n1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:27.220\n Well, we live in this world,\n\n1:15:27.220 --> 1:15:30.680\n so we can solve quite a lot of problems of this world\n\n1:15:30.680 --> 1:15:32.060\n by making the assumption\n\n1:15:32.060 --> 1:15:34.780\n that this world is fully understandable.\n\n1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:36.920\n And we don't need to worry about what's outside the world\n\n1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:41.480\n in some sense in order to build bridges and rockets\n\n1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:43.700\n and computers and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:15:43.700 --> 1:15:47.220\n It's only when we get to the questions that are deeper\n\n1:15:47.220 --> 1:15:49.420\n about why we're here at all,\n\n1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:51.100\n what does it mean to be good,\n\n1:15:51.100 --> 1:15:52.080\n all those kinds of things\n\n1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:54.620\n do we need to reach outside of this world?\n\n1:15:54.620 --> 1:15:55.980\n Can I introduce another one?\n\n1:15:55.980 --> 1:15:57.380\n So I talked about mathematics.\n\n1:15:57.380 --> 1:15:58.740\n I think it's stepping out of the cave,\n\n1:15:58.740 --> 1:16:02.760\n it's stepping out of just the purely empirical world.\n\n1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:05.140\n But the very fact that we use a word like universe\n\n1:16:05.140 --> 1:16:06.300\n to me is very interesting.\n\n1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:07.520\n Even if you say multiple universes,\n\n1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:12.520\n to me it's like, well, whatever the whole is, the totality.\n\n1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:15.680\n Universum, turn toward the one.\n\n1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:18.740\n Why would we call it that?\n\n1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:20.580\n Why wouldn't we just call it an aggregate?\n\n1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:22.020\n You know, it's just an aggregate of stuff.\n\n1:16:22.020 --> 1:16:23.260\n It's an aggregate of all kinds.\n\n1:16:23.260 --> 1:16:24.940\n But we call it a universe.\n\n1:16:24.940 --> 1:16:28.140\n And my answer from the classical metaphysical tradition\n\n1:16:28.140 --> 1:16:30.380\n is it's the intuition of being.\n\n1:16:30.380 --> 1:16:32.700\n So I immediately experience things here,\n\n1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:35.100\n the color and shape, and I can measure them.\n\n1:16:35.100 --> 1:16:37.260\n But when I've really stepped out of the cave\n\n1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:39.540\n and I've now engaged beyond mathematics even,\n\n1:16:39.540 --> 1:16:41.700\n I'm now into metaphysical reflection.\n\n1:16:41.700 --> 1:16:44.820\n I'm interested not just in this thing as an object\n\n1:16:44.820 --> 1:16:46.300\n and how it's colored and shaped\n\n1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:48.560\n and what its atoms and quarks and all that are.\n\n1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:49.620\n That's fine.\n\n1:16:49.620 --> 1:16:51.540\n But I'm interested now in,\n\n1:16:51.540 --> 1:16:53.660\n I don't mean to say this thing is real.\n\n1:16:53.660 --> 1:16:56.100\n So what makes this a being?\n\n1:16:56.100 --> 1:16:58.460\n And then what are the characteristics of being?\n\n1:16:58.460 --> 1:17:00.140\n So now from Aristotle to Heidegger,\n\n1:17:00.140 --> 1:17:02.740\n this question of the nature of being.\n\n1:17:02.740 --> 1:17:04.980\n But see, I would say we call it a universe\n\n1:17:04.980 --> 1:17:08.060\n because it's turned toward the one of being.\n\n1:17:08.060 --> 1:17:09.660\n It's this intuition that whatever,\n\n1:17:09.660 --> 1:17:12.460\n from quarks to galaxies to whatever,\n\n1:17:12.460 --> 1:17:15.420\n give me a billion other universes,\n\n1:17:15.420 --> 1:17:17.580\n it would still be existence, right?\n\n1:17:17.580 --> 1:17:19.340\n It's turned toward the one.\n\n1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:22.500\n That being unites our experience.\n\n1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:24.740\n And so now I'm at the metaphysical level of analysis.\n\n1:17:24.740 --> 1:17:27.220\n I've taken another step out of the cave.\n\n1:17:27.220 --> 1:17:29.460\n In Plato's language, I'm at the formal level now,\n\n1:17:29.460 --> 1:17:31.580\n beyond mathematics, the level of forms.\n\n1:17:31.580 --> 1:17:34.180\n And the formal is inclusive of the mathematical,\n\n1:17:34.180 --> 1:17:36.300\n which is inclusive of the physical.\n\n1:17:36.300 --> 1:17:37.620\n And I think that's Eugene Wigner,\n\n1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:39.780\n is that the mathematical includes the physical.\n\n1:17:39.780 --> 1:17:42.520\n It is metaphysically prior to it.\n\n1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:45.460\n But here we are sitting in the physical\n\n1:17:45.460 --> 1:17:47.060\n trying to make sense of why\n\n1:17:47.060 --> 1:17:48.500\n the unreasonable effectiveness\n\n1:17:48.500 --> 1:17:51.940\n is the thing that's beyond, which is the mathematics.\n\n1:17:51.940 --> 1:17:53.020\n My answer is God.\n\n1:17:53.020 --> 1:17:54.740\n And I don't know a better answer.\n\n1:17:54.740 --> 1:17:58.740\n And as I read Wigner, he wasn't ready to say that.\n\n1:17:58.740 --> 1:18:00.700\n But I think the language is gesturing.\n\n1:18:01.820 --> 1:18:02.900\n I was reading someone recently,\n\n1:18:02.900 --> 1:18:04.820\n some very well known physicist,\n\n1:18:04.820 --> 1:18:07.420\n who said his answer to Wigner's question\n\n1:18:07.420 --> 1:18:11.300\n is that whoever is responsible for the universe\n\n1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:12.620\n must be a mathematician.\n\n1:18:13.460 --> 1:18:15.220\n And I thought, yeah, that's right.\n\n1:18:16.660 --> 1:18:18.140\n Let me ask you about Jordan Peterson.\n\n1:18:18.140 --> 1:18:20.740\n We had a great conversation with him.\n\n1:18:20.740 --> 1:18:24.220\n He has a complicated and nuanced view of faith,\n\n1:18:24.220 --> 1:18:25.920\n or faith period.\n\n1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.720\n He has said that he believes in Jesus,\n\n1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:30.340\n the person and the myth,\n\n1:18:30.340 --> 1:18:33.660\n and some of the full richness and complexity\n\n1:18:33.660 --> 1:18:35.860\n that you've talked about.\n\n1:18:35.860 --> 1:18:37.540\n But he's surprised by his faith.\n\n1:18:37.540 --> 1:18:39.420\n He's not sure what to make of it.\n\n1:18:39.420 --> 1:18:41.440\n He's almost like meta struggling\n\n1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:43.940\n with what the heck his faith means.\n\n1:18:43.940 --> 1:18:45.940\n He's a super powerful intellect\n\n1:18:45.940 --> 1:18:49.180\n that can't compute the faith that he's experiencing.\n\n1:18:49.180 --> 1:18:52.380\n So what are some interesting differences\n\n1:18:52.380 --> 1:18:56.220\n between the two of you, or some commonalities\n\n1:18:56.220 --> 1:18:59.420\n in terms of your understanding of faith?\n\n1:18:59.420 --> 1:19:00.580\n He's a very interesting guy.\n\n1:19:00.580 --> 1:19:02.120\n I've had a couple of conversations with him.\n\n1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:06.020\n And I do think he's moving in the direction of faith.\n\n1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:09.140\n And his lectures on the Bible are very fine, I think.\n\n1:19:09.140 --> 1:19:10.540\n He reminds me of the church fathers,\n\n1:19:10.540 --> 1:19:12.980\n because the church fathers would have looked at the,\n\n1:19:12.980 --> 1:19:15.500\n they call it the moral sense of the scripture.\n\n1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:18.060\n Peterson probably called it the psychological meaning.\n\n1:19:18.060 --> 1:19:19.860\n But I think he's doing a lot of that.\n\n1:19:19.860 --> 1:19:22.580\n He, as I read him and talk to him,\n\n1:19:22.580 --> 1:19:25.860\n I think he's kind of at a Kantian level in regard to Jesus.\n\n1:19:25.860 --> 1:19:29.140\n What I mean there is, for Kant, Jesus is,\n\n1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:30.780\n it's not so much the historical Jesus,\n\n1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:31.900\n this figure from long ago.\n\n1:19:31.900 --> 1:19:35.780\n It's Jesus as an archetype of the moral life.\n\n1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:37.820\n You know, he says he's the image of the person\n\n1:19:37.820 --> 1:19:39.500\n perfectly pleasing to God.\n\n1:19:39.500 --> 1:19:43.180\n And so Jesus inhabits our kind of moral imagination\n\n1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:48.100\n as a heuristic, as a goal that we're tending toward.\n\n1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:51.560\n But the historical person of Jesus for Kant is like,\n\n1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:52.980\n well, let's not fuss about that so much.\n\n1:19:52.980 --> 1:19:54.740\n It's this figure.\n\n1:19:54.740 --> 1:19:56.940\n And as I read Peterson, especially, and talk to him,\n\n1:19:56.940 --> 1:20:01.020\n I think he's kind of there with the archetype of Jesus.\n\n1:20:01.020 --> 1:20:04.860\n And even language of like, live as though God exists.\n\n1:20:04.860 --> 1:20:06.460\n That's the als ob of Kant.\n\n1:20:06.460 --> 1:20:09.940\n You know, the kind of as if attitude.\n\n1:20:09.940 --> 1:20:12.040\n And where I repress him when we talk\n\n1:20:12.040 --> 1:20:14.580\n is in the direction of, no, that's not Christianity yet.\n\n1:20:14.580 --> 1:20:18.080\n I mean, that's enlightenment moral philosophy.\n\n1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:20.580\n But Christianity is very interested\n\n1:20:20.580 --> 1:20:22.220\n in this historical figure,\n\n1:20:22.220 --> 1:20:26.500\n and very interested that God really became one of us.\n\n1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:29.620\n And he's not just an archetype of the moral life.\n\n1:20:29.620 --> 1:20:34.040\n He's someone, he's a person who's invaded our world\n\n1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:35.780\n and gone all the way to the bottom of sin\n\n1:20:35.780 --> 1:20:37.260\n and thereby saved us, you know.\n\n1:20:37.260 --> 1:20:40.820\n So the facticity of Jesus ended up the resurrection.\n\n1:20:40.820 --> 1:20:43.340\n So like, Peterson will talk about the resurrection\n\n1:20:43.340 --> 1:20:45.220\n as a myth and all that.\n\n1:20:45.220 --> 1:20:47.580\n And you can find that in different cultures, et cetera.\n\n1:20:47.580 --> 1:20:51.420\n But Christianity is saying something else.\n\n1:20:51.420 --> 1:20:54.900\n So in Christianity, when we're talking about who is Jesus,\n\n1:20:54.900 --> 1:20:56.580\n it's not just an archetype.\n\n1:20:56.580 --> 1:20:57.940\n It's not just a myth.\n\n1:20:57.940 --> 1:20:59.420\n It's a historical figure.\n\n1:20:59.420 --> 1:21:04.420\n And the very grounded fact that God became one of us\n\n1:21:04.420 --> 1:21:08.180\n is fundamental to this idea of what Christianity is,\n\n1:21:08.180 --> 1:21:09.380\n what it means to be a Christian.\n\n1:21:09.380 --> 1:21:14.380\n It's the sin and the love that came here down to earth.\n\n1:21:16.380 --> 1:21:17.820\n It means we can be one with God.\n\n1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:18.720\n So that's essential.\n\n1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:19.980\n It's not just an archetype.\n\n1:21:19.980 --> 1:21:20.940\n That's right.\n\n1:21:20.940 --> 1:21:23.100\n You know, it always strikes me,\n\n1:21:23.100 --> 1:21:24.980\n the difference between, let's say,\n\n1:21:24.980 --> 1:21:27.380\n mythic expressions and the New Testament.\n\n1:21:28.820 --> 1:21:32.300\n Read someone like Carl Jung and then Joseph Campbell,\n\n1:21:32.300 --> 1:21:34.220\n whom he influenced, and then now Jordan Peterson,\n\n1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:35.380\n who's very Jungian.\n\n1:21:35.380 --> 1:21:37.900\n And this sort of archetypal reading of the scriptures.\n\n1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:38.740\n And great.\n\n1:21:38.740 --> 1:21:39.980\n I mean, I think it's very interesting,\n\n1:21:39.980 --> 1:21:42.300\n and there's a lot going on there.\n\n1:21:42.300 --> 1:21:44.360\n There's a sort of calmness, though, about it.\n\n1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:45.700\n Like, yeah, interesting.\n\n1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:47.500\n And that's in this culture and that culture,\n\n1:21:47.500 --> 1:21:49.380\n and it's the form of the moral life,\n\n1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:51.420\n and mm hmm, I understand all that.\n\n1:21:51.420 --> 1:21:53.220\n Then you read the New Testament.\n\n1:21:53.220 --> 1:21:57.220\n Whatever those people are talking about, it's not that.\n\n1:21:57.220 --> 1:22:00.920\n They are grabbing you by the shoulders\n\n1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:03.020\n and shaking you to get your attention,\n\n1:22:03.020 --> 1:22:06.900\n to tell you about something that happened to them, right?\n\n1:22:06.900 --> 1:22:08.860\n Like the resurrection, you know,\n\n1:22:08.860 --> 1:22:10.660\n the myth of the dying and rising God\n\n1:22:10.660 --> 1:22:13.540\n and how powerful it is in shaping our consciousness.\n\n1:22:13.540 --> 1:22:15.000\n Mm hmm, that's fascinating.\n\n1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.340\n That's not the New Testament.\n\n1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:18.460\n The New Testament is, did you hear?\n\n1:22:18.460 --> 1:22:22.100\n Did you, Jesus of Nazareth, whom they put to death,\n\n1:22:22.100 --> 1:22:23.620\n God raised him from the dead,\n\n1:22:23.620 --> 1:22:26.660\n and he was seen by 500, and he was seen by Peter.\n\n1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:29.720\n And then lastly, I saw him.\n\n1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:31.260\n That's how Paul talks.\n\n1:22:31.260 --> 1:22:34.920\n It's not the detached, you know,\n\n1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:37.980\n psychologist musing on archetypal things.\n\n1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:40.580\n And I think that makes a huge difference\n\n1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:41.660\n when it comes to Christianity.\n\n1:22:41.660 --> 1:22:46.660\n The intensity of the historical details are essential here.\n\n1:22:46.740 --> 1:22:50.980\n So if you look at Hitler and Nazi Germany,\n\n1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:53.380\n it's not enough to say, well, power corrupts,\n\n1:22:53.380 --> 1:22:57.060\n and sometimes, so looking at the archetype of Hitler,\n\n1:22:57.060 --> 1:22:58.700\n it's much, much more important,\n\n1:22:58.700 --> 1:23:01.660\n much more powerful to look at the details\n\n1:23:01.660 --> 1:23:03.720\n of how he came to power,\n\n1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:06.540\n what are the ways he did evil onto the world,\n\n1:23:06.540 --> 1:23:09.020\n and then you can get really intense\n\n1:23:09.020 --> 1:23:12.220\n about your struggle with some of the complexities\n\n1:23:12.220 --> 1:23:14.740\n of human nature and power on institutions\n\n1:23:14.740 --> 1:23:15.860\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:23:15.860 --> 1:23:18.420\n So the historical nature of the Bible.\n\n1:23:18.420 --> 1:23:19.980\n We're an historical religion.\n\n1:23:19.980 --> 1:23:21.360\n And we've been, it's important.\n\n1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:23.980\n We generate philosophical reflection.\n\n1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:26.660\n We can find common ground with archetypal thinking\n\n1:23:26.660 --> 1:23:28.060\n and all that, we can.\n\n1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:30.820\n And the church fathers used Greek philosophy,\n\n1:23:30.820 --> 1:23:33.460\n and Aquinas uses Aristotle, and all that's great.\n\n1:23:33.460 --> 1:23:35.380\n But we're an historical religion,\n\n1:23:35.380 --> 1:23:37.520\n and that matters immensely.\n\n1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:40.740\n Is the Bible the literal word of God?\n\n1:23:40.740 --> 1:23:44.440\n How do you make sense of the words that make up the Bible?\n\n1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:46.060\n I think the best way to get at the Bible\n\n1:23:46.060 --> 1:23:48.380\n is to think of it as a library, not a book.\n\n1:23:48.380 --> 1:23:50.160\n So it's a collection of books, right,\n\n1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:53.500\n from a wide variety of periods, different authors,\n\n1:23:53.500 --> 1:23:56.460\n different audiences, and different genre.\n\n1:23:56.460 --> 1:23:59.420\n So in the Bible, you find poetry, you find song,\n\n1:23:59.420 --> 1:24:02.140\n you find something like history, not in our sense,\n\n1:24:02.140 --> 1:24:03.580\n but something like history.\n\n1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.740\n You find gospel, which is its own genre.\n\n1:24:05.740 --> 1:24:08.780\n You find epistolary literature like Paul.\n\n1:24:08.780 --> 1:24:10.840\n You find apocalyptic.\n\n1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:13.000\n There's all this in the Bible.\n\n1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.540\n So is the Bible literally the word of God?\n\n1:24:15.540 --> 1:24:18.620\n It's like saying, is the library literally true?\n\n1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:20.900\n It depends on what section you're in, right?\n\n1:24:20.900 --> 1:24:25.900\n So parts of like one and two Samuel, one and two Kings,\n\n1:24:26.100 --> 1:24:27.300\n number of places in the Old Testament.\n\n1:24:27.300 --> 1:24:29.260\n Are there elements of the historical in there?\n\n1:24:29.260 --> 1:24:31.980\n Sure, but it's theologically interpreted history.\n\n1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:33.940\n It's not like our sense of history of, you know,\n\n1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:37.940\n give me 10,000 footnotes and I'm gonna look\n\n1:24:37.940 --> 1:24:40.180\n at all the source material I can possibly find.\n\n1:24:40.180 --> 1:24:42.780\n It's more like ancient history, like Herodotus,\n\n1:24:42.780 --> 1:24:44.440\n people like that.\n\n1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:46.220\n But then there's poetry and there's myth\n\n1:24:46.220 --> 1:24:47.800\n and there's legend and there's song\n\n1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:48.880\n and all that stuff in the Bible.\n\n1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:53.880\n So God breathes through all of it, I would say.\n\n1:24:55.820 --> 1:24:58.500\n He inspired all of it, right, inspirare.\n\n1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.440\n He's breathing through all of it.\n\n1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:02.820\n God is speaking through all of it.\n\n1:25:02.820 --> 1:25:05.060\n But he speaks in different voices.\n\n1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:06.980\n He uses different human instruments\n\n1:25:06.980 --> 1:25:09.760\n and he uses different genre and different types of language.\n\n1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:10.980\n So we have to be sensitive to that\n\n1:25:10.980 --> 1:25:12.260\n when we're interpreting the Bible.\n\n1:25:12.260 --> 1:25:16.060\n So the different instruments are more or less,\n\n1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:18.140\n some are more perfect than others in terms of music?\n\n1:25:18.140 --> 1:25:18.980\n No, I wouldn't say that.\n\n1:25:18.980 --> 1:25:19.820\n I wouldn't say more perfect.\n\n1:25:19.820 --> 1:25:20.820\n I'd say they're just different.\n\n1:25:20.820 --> 1:25:23.360\n It's like a symphony and God's like a conductor\n\n1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.700\n and there's all kinds of different instruments\n\n1:25:24.700 --> 1:25:27.840\n in the orchestra and he loves to breathe through the Psalms.\n\n1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:29.860\n I prayed the Psalms this morning, I do every day.\n\n1:25:29.860 --> 1:25:32.760\n In my office, you know, those are songs.\n\n1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:34.620\n They probably were literally sung, most of them,\n\n1:25:34.620 --> 1:25:35.660\n at one point.\n\n1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:38.380\n He breathes through apocalyptic.\n\n1:25:38.380 --> 1:25:39.900\n Like we're reading the book of Revelation now\n\n1:25:39.900 --> 1:25:43.420\n in the Easter season and it's this wild and woolly book.\n\n1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:47.820\n It should be filmed by Spielberg or somebody today.\n\n1:25:47.820 --> 1:25:49.720\n And he speaks through the Gospels.\n\n1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.900\n The Gospels correspond in genre\n\n1:25:51.900 --> 1:25:54.180\n to what I call ancient biography.\n\n1:25:54.180 --> 1:25:56.180\n That's the genre of the Gospels.\n\n1:25:56.180 --> 1:25:59.340\n It's wrong to call them like mythic or simply literary.\n\n1:25:59.340 --> 1:26:01.140\n They're like ancient biographies.\n\n1:26:02.780 --> 1:26:05.780\n You have the Pauline letters which are about\n\n1:26:05.780 --> 1:26:07.700\n particular cities that Paul was visiting\n\n1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:09.400\n and particular people he knew.\n\n1:26:09.400 --> 1:26:12.380\n So you just gotta be sensitive to the genre all the time.\n\n1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:14.580\n Let's return back to human institutions\n\n1:26:14.580 --> 1:26:19.260\n and talk about history of human civilization and politics.\n\n1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:23.340\n So one question to ask is was America founded\n\n1:26:23.340 --> 1:26:26.100\n as a Christian nation in your view?\n\n1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:28.780\n If we look at the Declaration of Independence,\n\n1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:30.720\n what did the words mean?\n\n1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:32.780\n We hold these truths to be self evident\n\n1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:34.820\n that all men are created equal,\n\n1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:36.900\n that they are endowed by their creator\n\n1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:39.220\n with certain inalienable rights\n\n1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:41.820\n that among these are life, liberty,\n\n1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:43.860\n and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n1:26:43.860 --> 1:26:47.540\n It seems like God is breathing through those words too.\n\n1:26:47.540 --> 1:26:49.260\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n1:26:49.260 --> 1:26:53.260\n The founders would be some kind of combination of deism,\n\n1:26:53.260 --> 1:26:56.940\n certainly Christianity is coming up through them,\n\n1:26:56.940 --> 1:27:01.060\n enlightenment, rationalism, all in kind of a mix.\n\n1:27:01.060 --> 1:27:03.300\n So you're not gonna find in our founding fathers\n\n1:27:03.300 --> 1:27:05.820\n simply a Thomas Aquinas or like a purely\n\n1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:08.220\n classically Christian understanding.\n\n1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:11.700\n It's Christianity in those various expressions.\n\n1:27:11.700 --> 1:27:13.560\n Because actually I would see the enlightenment\n\n1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:16.780\n as a sort of child of Christianity.\n\n1:27:16.780 --> 1:27:17.600\n We could talk about that.\n\n1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:20.560\n But having said all that, yes,\n\n1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:24.620\n I think they are expressing at least the residue\n\n1:27:24.620 --> 1:27:28.500\n of a once deeply integrated Christian sense of things\n\n1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:32.820\n that our rights are not created by the government.\n\n1:27:32.820 --> 1:27:36.060\n They're not doled out by the government.\n\n1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:37.420\n They come from God.\n\n1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:39.780\n And the other thing I find really interesting is equality\n\n1:27:39.780 --> 1:27:43.700\n because look in classical philosophy, political philosophy,\n\n1:27:43.700 --> 1:27:47.260\n Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, it's not equality.\n\n1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:50.180\n For them it's our inequality that's really interesting.\n\n1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:52.440\n So Plato divides us into these three classes\n\n1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:55.100\n and Aristotle says only a tiny little coterie\n\n1:27:55.100 --> 1:27:58.100\n of property males of sufficient education\n\n1:27:58.100 --> 1:27:59.300\n should be in the political life.\n\n1:27:59.300 --> 1:28:01.220\n The rest should all be in private life.\n\n1:28:01.220 --> 1:28:03.180\n And then some are suited for slavery.\n\n1:28:03.180 --> 1:28:05.740\n So I mean he divides us dramatically.\n\n1:28:05.740 --> 1:28:07.100\n Same with Cicero and so on.\n\n1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:10.260\n Where does this come from, this weird idea\n\n1:28:10.260 --> 1:28:12.040\n that we're all equal?\n\n1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:12.880\n I mean how?\n\n1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:14.100\n We're not equal in beauty, not equal in strength.\n\n1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:16.120\n We're not equal in moral attainment.\n\n1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:18.420\n We're not equal in intelligence.\n\n1:28:18.420 --> 1:28:20.180\n So what is it?\n\n1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:22.500\n And I think the residue especially comes through\n\n1:28:22.500 --> 1:28:27.500\n in that little word that all men are created equal.\n\n1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:31.460\n That's our equality, that we're all equally children of God.\n\n1:28:31.460 --> 1:28:32.860\n So take God out of the picture.\n\n1:28:32.860 --> 1:28:35.900\n I think we are gonna slide rapidly\n\n1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:38.500\n into an embrace of inequality.\n\n1:28:38.500 --> 1:28:40.740\n Now in the classical world, yes,\n\n1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:42.560\n but heck, look at the 20th century.\n\n1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:45.940\n I mean when God is excluded in a very systematic way,\n\n1:28:45.940 --> 1:28:48.220\n I think you saw the suspension of rights\n\n1:28:48.220 --> 1:28:51.740\n and the suspension of equality like mad.\n\n1:28:51.740 --> 1:28:54.480\n So no, I think it's very important\n\n1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:57.520\n that God is in the picture and that we're a nation under God.\n\n1:28:57.520 --> 1:28:58.460\n It matters enormously.\n\n1:28:58.460 --> 1:29:00.320\n That's not pious boilerplate.\n\n1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:03.500\n That's at the rational foundations of our democracy.\n\n1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:05.580\n So do you think Nietzsche was onto something\n\n1:29:05.580 --> 1:29:09.340\n with the idea, looking into the 20th century,\n\n1:29:09.340 --> 1:29:10.580\n that God is dead?\n\n1:29:10.580 --> 1:29:15.580\n That there is a cultural distancing from a belief in God?\n\n1:29:19.140 --> 1:29:20.700\n Yeah, I'd be somewhat sympathetic\n\n1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:23.460\n to Jordan Peterson's reading of Nietzsche there.\n\n1:29:23.460 --> 1:29:26.500\n Namely, it's not Nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop.\n\n1:29:26.500 --> 1:29:28.580\n Hey, God is dead.\n\n1:29:28.580 --> 1:29:30.100\n It's more of a lament.\n\n1:29:30.100 --> 1:29:32.100\n God is dead and we've killed him.\n\n1:29:32.100 --> 1:29:35.420\n And what will happen in the wake of that?\n\n1:29:35.420 --> 1:29:38.340\n And I think, yeah, much of the totalitarianism\n\n1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:43.340\n of the 20th century follows from that questioning of God\n\n1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.940\n and the dismissal of God from public life.\n\n1:29:46.940 --> 1:29:48.740\n So I would be sympathetic with that.\n\n1:29:50.220 --> 1:29:51.980\n When we're beyond good and evil,\n\n1:29:51.980 --> 1:29:54.400\n and all that's left is the will to power,\n\n1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:58.040\n and then why are we surprised at the powerful rise\n\n1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:01.180\n and that they use the powerless for their purposes?\n\n1:30:01.180 --> 1:30:04.060\n When we forget ideas like equality and rights,\n\n1:30:04.060 --> 1:30:05.300\n which are grounded in God,\n\n1:30:05.300 --> 1:30:08.980\n why are we surprised that death camps follow?\n\n1:30:08.980 --> 1:30:11.500\n So I think there's a correlation there for sure.\n\n1:30:11.500 --> 1:30:13.660\n I don't know, I believe that there's a capacity\n\n1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:17.740\n to do good in all of us and a capacity to do evil,\n\n1:30:17.740 --> 1:30:20.480\n and there's something that tends towards good,\n\n1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:22.060\n whatever that is.\n\n1:30:22.060 --> 1:30:24.940\n I tend to think that if that community,\n\n1:30:24.940 --> 1:30:27.700\n that love that we talked about, they find each other,\n\n1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:30.780\n they find the good.\n\n1:30:30.780 --> 1:30:32.300\n If you don't constrain the resources,\n\n1:30:32.300 --> 1:30:33.220\n if you don't push them,\n\n1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:37.460\n if you don't artificially create conflict\n\n1:30:37.460 --> 1:30:41.300\n through power centers and evil charismatic leaders,\n\n1:30:41.300 --> 1:30:42.980\n then people will be good to each other.\n\n1:30:42.980 --> 1:30:47.100\n And whether that's God or some other source\n\n1:30:47.100 --> 1:30:52.100\n of deep moral meaning,\n\n1:30:52.180 --> 1:30:55.480\n that seems to be essential for a functioning civilization.\n\n1:30:56.380 --> 1:30:58.300\n And it's hard, I mean, that's what humans are.\n\n1:30:58.300 --> 1:31:01.460\n We're searching for what that God is, what that means.\n\n1:31:01.460 --> 1:31:02.780\n You know what that triggers in my mind?\n\n1:31:02.780 --> 1:31:04.060\n I wonder if you agree with this,\n\n1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:06.260\n that the modern sciences drew their strength\n\n1:31:06.260 --> 1:31:07.540\n from their narrowness.\n\n1:31:07.540 --> 1:31:10.740\n And what I mean there is they almost completely bracketed\n\n1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:13.100\n formal and final causality in the Aristotelian sense,\n\n1:31:13.100 --> 1:31:16.220\n and they focused on efficient and material causality.\n\n1:31:16.220 --> 1:31:18.220\n And that gave, as I say, great strength,\n\n1:31:18.220 --> 1:31:20.140\n but from the narrowness of focus.\n\n1:31:20.140 --> 1:31:22.660\n But for Aristotle, the more important causes\n\n1:31:22.660 --> 1:31:24.900\n are the final and the formal causes.\n\n1:31:24.900 --> 1:31:28.400\n And so final causality there, what's drawing us?\n\n1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:30.440\n So for Aristotle, he'd look at someone like me and say,\n\n1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:34.980\n okay, you have a intelligible structure,\n\n1:31:34.980 --> 1:31:37.580\n and that leads you to seek certain things\n\n1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:40.060\n for the perfection of that structure, you know?\n\n1:31:40.060 --> 1:31:41.780\n And fair enough, I think that's right.\n\n1:31:41.780 --> 1:31:42.700\n So I seek the good.\n\n1:31:42.700 --> 1:31:44.780\n Right now, I'm seeking the good of being with you.\n\n1:31:44.780 --> 1:31:47.060\n I said, yeah, I'll sit down with Lex Friedman\n\n1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:49.540\n and we'll talk about deep and important things.\n\n1:31:49.540 --> 1:31:52.320\n That's the good I sought this morning when I woke up.\n\n1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:54.360\n Now, why am I seeking that?\n\n1:31:54.360 --> 1:31:56.980\n Well, for a higher reason, a higher good, you know?\n\n1:31:56.980 --> 1:32:01.620\n Because it's part of my work, my ministry is to, you know,\n\n1:32:01.620 --> 1:32:04.740\n the church reaching out beyond itself to the wider culture,\n\n1:32:04.740 --> 1:32:08.160\n and okay, well, why do you want that?\n\n1:32:08.160 --> 1:32:10.100\n Well, because I want to bring more and more people\n\n1:32:10.100 --> 1:32:13.000\n into what I think is beautiful and true and good\n\n1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:13.900\n in the church.\n\n1:32:13.900 --> 1:32:15.660\n Well, how come you want that?\n\n1:32:15.660 --> 1:32:17.500\n Well, because a long time ago,\n\n1:32:17.500 --> 1:32:19.820\n I was kind of myself brought into that realm\n\n1:32:19.820 --> 1:32:21.340\n and find it very compelling.\n\n1:32:21.340 --> 1:32:22.560\n Yeah, but then why do you want that?\n\n1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:25.380\n Well, because ultimately, I want to be friends with God.\n\n1:32:25.380 --> 1:32:27.020\n Now, I've given you one example there,\n\n1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:30.700\n but any act of the will, it seems to me,\n\n1:32:30.700 --> 1:32:32.780\n has to be analyzed that way.\n\n1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:34.180\n The will seeks something.\n\n1:32:34.180 --> 1:32:36.440\n It seeks the good, right, by definition.\n\n1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:38.920\n But the good always nests like a Russian doll\n\n1:32:38.920 --> 1:32:40.780\n in a higher good, right,\n\n1:32:40.780 --> 1:32:43.100\n which then nests into still higher good.\n\n1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:45.520\n Until you come, this is Aquinas,\n\n1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:49.500\n to some, in this sense, uncaused cause,\n\n1:32:49.500 --> 1:32:51.300\n an uncaused final cause,\n\n1:32:51.300 --> 1:32:53.520\n there has to be some summum bonum, right,\n\n1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:56.520\n some supreme good that you're looking for.\n\n1:32:57.660 --> 1:32:59.820\n And that's God, by the way.\n\n1:32:59.820 --> 1:33:01.780\n That's another, I think, rational path to God,\n\n1:33:01.780 --> 1:33:04.620\n is every single moment, every day,\n\n1:33:04.620 --> 1:33:07.020\n we are implicitly seeking God.\n\n1:33:07.020 --> 1:33:10.900\n So with your Word on Fire ministries\n\n1:33:10.900 --> 1:33:13.180\n and the website and the communication efforts,\n\n1:33:13.180 --> 1:33:15.240\n what is the thing you're seeking?\n\n1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:19.900\n Just you, if we can pause and for a brief moment,\n\n1:33:19.900 --> 1:33:21.280\n allow you to be prideful.\n\n1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:24.800\n Or, of course, just joking,\n\n1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:27.280\n but what is your local efforts,\n\n1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:29.320\n your small little pocket of the world\n\n1:33:29.320 --> 1:33:34.320\n with small, in quotes, with Word on Fire?\n\n1:33:35.460 --> 1:33:37.760\n Yeah, it's just using the media,\n\n1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:39.460\n especially the new media, the social media,\n\n1:33:39.460 --> 1:33:41.200\n to get the gospel out.\n\n1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:43.800\n So I started, what, 20 some years ago,\n\n1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:47.600\n just on a radio show in Chicago, 515 on Sunday morning.\n\n1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:49.960\n I had a 15 minute sermon show.\n\n1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:51.680\n And I asked the people in this parish I was at,\n\n1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:55.360\n I said, I need $50,000 to get on for 15 minutes\n\n1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:56.880\n at 515 on Sunday morning.\n\n1:33:56.880 --> 1:33:58.800\n And they all laughed when I proposed that,\n\n1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:00.040\n but they gave me the money.\n\n1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:00.980\n So that's how I got started,\n\n1:34:00.980 --> 1:34:02.720\n just doing a sermon on the radio.\n\n1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:06.320\n And then it branched off into video stuff and TV.\n\n1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:08.320\n And then I did a documentary.\n\n1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:09.280\n I went all over the world\n\n1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:11.800\n and kind of told the story of Catholicism.\n\n1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:12.940\n So that's how we started.\n\n1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:15.800\n And now I'm using all the new media and social media.\n\n1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:18.080\n But what I really love, what we're doing today,\n\n1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:19.200\n something I really like,\n\n1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:20.960\n which is having a conversation\n\n1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:23.120\n outside of just the narrow Catholic world\n\n1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:24.480\n or even the narrow Christian world,\n\n1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:26.700\n but to look out to the wider culture\n\n1:34:26.700 --> 1:34:29.060\n and who's talking about interesting things\n\n1:34:29.060 --> 1:34:31.160\n and how can the church engage there?\n\n1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:34.120\n And so that's the purpose of Word on Fire.\n\n1:34:34.120 --> 1:34:39.120\n Is it overwhelming to face so many different atheists\n\n1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:44.560\n than complex thinkers like Jordan Peterson\n\n1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:47.500\n and some of the more political style thinkers\n\n1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:49.160\n that you've spoken with?\n\n1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:52.640\n Is that, what is it, Dave Rubin,\n\n1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:57.640\n who's also has a way different worldview as well?\n\n1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:00.040\n Is that terrifying?\n\n1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:01.640\n Is that exciting to you?\n\n1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:03.640\n Is it challenging?\n\n1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:06.520\n Yeah, maybe all of the above, but more exciting.\n\n1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:08.000\n I would say I like doing that.\n\n1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.280\n I was a teacher for a long time.\n\n1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:10.840\n I taught in the seminary for like 20 years.\n\n1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:13.240\n And so I've been engaging these questions for a long time.\n\n1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:14.080\n I'm a writer.\n\n1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:15.520\n I've written about 20 some books.\n\n1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:17.800\n And I write some at a popular level.\n\n1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:19.480\n I write some at a high academic level.\n\n1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:21.440\n And I like doing all that.\n\n1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:23.280\n So I love those ideas.\n\n1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.340\n I love those questions, love engaging people.\n\n1:35:26.340 --> 1:35:28.720\n And I find my own experience,\n\n1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:32.240\n you do run into, of course, a lot of the vitriol\n\n1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:34.800\n and kind of just stupidity and all that online.\n\n1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:35.640\n And I get it.\n\n1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:39.240\n And religion is such a magnet for people's hostility\n\n1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:40.060\n for different reasons.\n\n1:35:40.060 --> 1:35:40.920\n So I get that.\n\n1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:42.700\n Like you read it, we talked about,\n\n1:35:42.700 --> 1:35:47.340\n you have to wade through swamps of obscenity and everything.\n\n1:35:47.340 --> 1:35:49.240\n But I do it.\n\n1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:50.080\n I like it.\n\n1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:51.320\n And it's worthwhile.\n\n1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:53.160\n Because in that Reddit experience,\n\n1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:56.120\n so many of the issues that preoccupy young people,\n\n1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:57.120\n I can name them for you.\n\n1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:58.680\n Exactly what they are.\n\n1:35:58.680 --> 1:35:59.640\n It comes to religion.\n\n1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:01.000\n How do you know there's a God?\n\n1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:02.000\n So the God question.\n\n1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.720\n Secondly, why is there so much suffering in the world?\n\n1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:07.720\n Third question, why do you think your religion\n\n1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:08.920\n is the right religion?\n\n1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:11.320\n Fourth, why are you so mean to gay people?\n\n1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:14.780\n So those are the four things that I, again and again,\n\n1:36:14.780 --> 1:36:16.600\n come up when dealing with young people.\n\n1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:19.220\n I've told my brother bishops and priests about that.\n\n1:36:19.220 --> 1:36:22.200\n I said, structure your adult education programs\n\n1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:24.120\n or structure your youth outreach\n\n1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:25.520\n around those four questions.\n\n1:36:26.380 --> 1:36:28.400\n Well, let me ask you about gay marriage.\n\n1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:33.360\n How do we make sense of the love between a man and a man\n\n1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:36.680\n and a woman and a woman and the institution of marriage?\n\n1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.400\n We love friendship.\n\n1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:41.240\n And friendship is at the heart of things.\n\n1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:42.560\n And so nothing wrong with friendship\n\n1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:45.600\n between a man and a man, a woman and a woman.\n\n1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:48.360\n But go back to Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas\n\n1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:51.320\n about natural finalities and intelligible forms,\n\n1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:54.480\n that there's a certain form to human being,\n\n1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:56.840\n which includes the physical and includes the sexual.\n\n1:36:56.840 --> 1:36:58.280\n It has a proper finality.\n\n1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:01.360\n And so we'd recognize that finality is twofold,\n\n1:37:01.360 --> 1:37:03.100\n both unitive and procreative.\n\n1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:05.240\n And so those two we recognize\n\n1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:08.160\n as the appropriate expression of human sexuality.\n\n1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:11.600\n So that's why the church holds to sex\n\n1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:14.280\n between a man and a woman within the context of marriage\n\n1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:16.720\n is the right expression.\n\n1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:22.780\n We reach out to everybody in love and in respect\n\n1:37:22.780 --> 1:37:26.480\n and deep understanding and seeking to understand\n\n1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:28.420\n their lives from the inside.\n\n1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:29.440\n So I mean, all of that,\n\n1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:32.760\n I agree with the bridge building that we need to do\n\n1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:34.160\n to people like in the gay community\n\n1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:36.640\n and people in gay marriage and so on.\n\n1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:40.480\n So the church holds to the intelligible structure,\n\n1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:42.560\n if you want, of human sexuality\n\n1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:44.680\n and it reaches out to real human beings\n\n1:37:44.680 --> 1:37:47.920\n always in an attitude of invitation and love and so on.\n\n1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:49.400\n So it's somewhere in there\n\n1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:51.800\n that the church takes its stance.\n\n1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:56.060\n And so there's probably variation\n\n1:37:56.060 --> 1:37:58.320\n in the stances that it takes.\n\n1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:00.040\n So you're saying the institution of marriage\n\n1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:03.320\n is about the unitive, which is like the friendship,\n\n1:38:03.320 --> 1:38:08.320\n the deep connection between two humans and the procreative.\n\n1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:11.820\n So being able to have children and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:38:13.820 --> 1:38:14.660\n It's interesting.\n\n1:38:14.660 --> 1:38:19.660\n So is our gay couples seen as sinful?\n\n1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:23.560\n So does the church acknowledge the love?\n\n1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:24.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:26.400\n That's the deep love that's possible between a man and a man.\n\n1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:27.240\n I think so.\n\n1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:29.380\n Yeah, which is why the church says in its official teaching,\n\n1:38:29.380 --> 1:38:32.120\n it's the physical expression, let's say,\n\n1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:36.760\n of sexual passion between two men that is problematic,\n\n1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:39.440\n not their friendship, not their love for each other.\n\n1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:43.480\n So I think, yeah, we confirm the first.\n\n1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:45.600\n Well, let me ask you another difficult topic\n\n1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:46.680\n that's just happening.\n\n1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:49.600\n Unlike the other ones we talked about.\n\n1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:51.520\n That's going on in the news now.\n\n1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:54.080\n As we sit here today, the Supreme Court has voted\n\n1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:58.920\n to overturn abortion rights in a draft majority opinion\n\n1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:01.960\n striking down the landmark Roe versus Wade decision.\n\n1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:04.080\n What are your thoughts on this?\n\n1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:06.840\n First of all, the human institution of the Supreme Court\n\n1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:10.000\n making these decisions throughout its history.\n\n1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:14.800\n And second of all, just the idea, the really powerful,\n\n1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:18.320\n the controversial, the difficult idea of abortion.\n\n1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:22.760\n Yeah, I mean, I'm against abortion.\n\n1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:25.120\n I'm pro life.\n\n1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:27.320\n The church recognizes from the moment of conception,\n\n1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:28.900\n we're dealing with a human life\n\n1:39:28.900 --> 1:39:32.580\n that's worthy of respect and protection.\n\n1:39:32.580 --> 1:39:36.680\n Especially as you see the unfolding of that person\n\n1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:38.240\n across a pregnancy.\n\n1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:41.480\n But at every stage, we recognize the beauty\n\n1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:44.400\n and the dignity of that human being.\n\n1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:47.760\n And so we stand opposed to this,\n\n1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:49.640\n the outright killing of the innocent.\n\n1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:51.240\n So that's the church's view.\n\n1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:56.120\n Again, reaching out always in love and understanding\n\n1:39:56.120 --> 1:39:58.040\n and compassion to those who are dealing.\n\n1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:01.200\n And believe me, every single pastor, every single priest\n\n1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:03.320\n understands that, because we deal with people all the time\n\n1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:05.640\n who are in these painful situations.\n\n1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:08.880\n But that's the moral side of it.\n\n1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:11.680\n The legal side, I think Roe v. Wade was terribly decided.\n\n1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:14.280\n I think one of the worst expressions of American law\n\n1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:15.960\n since the Dred Scott decision.\n\n1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.800\n So I stand in favor of a returning Roe v. Wade and Casey.\n\n1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:21.080\n I think they were terrible.\n\n1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:23.520\n The Casey decision is instructive to me.\n\n1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:28.040\n It belongs to the nature of freedom, that decision says,\n\n1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:30.500\n to determine the meaning of one's own life.\n\n1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:32.560\n And I don't get the language exactly right,\n\n1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:34.720\n but end of the universe.\n\n1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:38.600\n Like it gives this staggering scope to our freedom,\n\n1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:40.320\n that we can determine the meaning.\n\n1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:42.040\n See, but that's repugnant to everything\n\n1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:43.420\n we've just talked about.\n\n1:40:43.420 --> 1:40:46.960\n That I'm inventing the meaning of my life\n\n1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:48.120\n and of the universe.\n\n1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:51.260\n And so Casey, though, was instructive in a way\n\n1:40:51.260 --> 1:40:55.480\n because it tips its hat toward the problem culturally,\n\n1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:59.560\n is that I think in my freedom, I can determine everything.\n\n1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:01.560\n My choice is all that matters.\n\n1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:04.960\n And I would say, no, your choice should be correlated\n\n1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:06.600\n to the order of the good.\n\n1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:08.140\n It's not sovereign.\n\n1:41:08.140 --> 1:41:10.520\n It doesn't reign sovereignly over being\n\n1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:12.760\n and it makes its own decisions.\n\n1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:15.060\n So I think Casey was terrible law\n\n1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:18.720\n and it was backing up Roe v. Wade, which is terrible law.\n\n1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:20.900\n So I'm in favor of the overturning of those.\n\n1:41:20.900 --> 1:41:22.560\n I've spoken out that many times.\n\n1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:24.620\n Now it'll return it to the individual states.\n\n1:41:24.620 --> 1:41:27.760\n It's not gonna solve the problem.\n\n1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:29.800\n The individual states will have to decide.\n\n1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:32.320\n I just heard yesterday, we were up in Sacramento,\n\n1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:35.160\n the bishops having our annual meeting.\n\n1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:38.920\n And so we got the word from the governor and the legislators\n\n1:41:38.920 --> 1:41:41.120\n that they're gonna push for a constitutional amendment\n\n1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:41.960\n in California.\n\n1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:44.800\n So basically to make any attempt to limit abortion\n\n1:41:44.800 --> 1:41:46.680\n in any way just illegal.\n\n1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.120\n I think that's barbaric.\n\n1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:51.960\n So I stand radically opposed to that.\n\n1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:54.120\n It's such an interesting line\n\n1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:57.680\n because if you believe that there's a,\n\n1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:00.740\n it's a line that struggles with the question\n\n1:42:00.740 --> 1:42:04.700\n of what does it mean to be a living being\n\n1:42:04.700 --> 1:42:07.200\n or to give life to something.\n\n1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:12.480\n Because if you believe that at the moment of conception\n\n1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:15.740\n you're basically creating a human life,\n\n1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:18.360\n then abortion is murder.\n\n1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:21.880\n And then if you don't,\n\n1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:26.160\n then it's a sort of basic biological choice\n\n1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:30.360\n that's not taking away of a life.\n\n1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:34.240\n And the gap between those two beliefs is so vast\n\n1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:36.760\n that it's hard and yet so fundamental\n\n1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:39.980\n to the question of what it means to be alive\n\n1:42:39.980 --> 1:42:43.360\n and the fundamental question about the respect\n\n1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:45.840\n for human life and human dignity.\n\n1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:47.340\n It's interesting to see.\n\n1:42:49.220 --> 1:42:51.160\n And also about freedom too.\n\n1:42:51.160 --> 1:42:53.920\n All of those things are mixed in there.\n\n1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:55.400\n It's a beautiful struggle.\n\n1:42:55.400 --> 1:42:57.360\n Maybe the freedom is the most important,\n\n1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:58.840\n this sort of freedom run amok.\n\n1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:03.640\n Or in classical philosophy and theology,\n\n1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:07.680\n freedom is not self determination.\n\n1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:12.680\n Freedom is the disciplining of desire\n\n1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:15.840\n so as to make the achievement of the good\n\n1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:19.520\n first possible and then effortless.\n\n1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:20.360\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:22.560\n So modern freedom and the roots of that\n\n1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:26.160\n are people like William of Ockham in the late Middle Ages.\n\n1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:28.340\n Freedom means I hover above the yes and the no.\n\n1:43:28.340 --> 1:43:29.280\n Do I do yes or no?\n\n1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:31.880\n And I'm the sovereign subject of that choice.\n\n1:43:31.880 --> 1:43:35.460\n And on no basis I will say yes or no.\n\n1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:39.560\n I'm like Louis XIV or I'm like Stalin or something.\n\n1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:42.800\n But Aquinas wouldn't have recognized that as freedom.\n\n1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:46.000\n For him, I got this desire in me.\n\n1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.420\n I've got this will and it's pushing toward the good.\n\n1:43:49.420 --> 1:43:51.280\n But the trouble is I got so many attachments\n\n1:43:51.280 --> 1:43:54.760\n and I'm so stupid and I'm so conditioned by my sin\n\n1:43:54.760 --> 1:43:56.280\n that I can't achieve it.\n\n1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:59.520\n So I need to be disciplined in my desire\n\n1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:01.880\n so as to make that achievement possible\n\n1:44:01.880 --> 1:44:05.440\n and then effortless so right now\n\n1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:07.960\n I'm freely speaking English to you.\n\n1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:10.400\n And you had the experience and I've had it too\n\n1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:11.800\n of learning a foreign language.\n\n1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:14.880\n And don't you feel unfree?\n\n1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:17.760\n You know, like when you're struggling with a language.\n\n1:44:17.760 --> 1:44:19.600\n When I was over in Paris doing my doctoral work\n\n1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:21.520\n and I was okay with French,\n\n1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:23.720\n but my first time in a seminar\n\n1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:27.080\n and there's all these intelligent francophones\n\n1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:28.480\n around the table and they're all just,\n\n1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:32.200\n and I'm trying to say my little thing in my awkward French.\n\n1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:37.200\n And I felt unfree because my desire wasn't directed.\n\n1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:42.680\n But then over time I became freer\n\n1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:44.520\n and freer speaker of French.\n\n1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:47.040\n I was ordered more to the good.\n\n1:44:47.040 --> 1:44:48.660\n That's a better understanding of freedom\n\n1:44:48.660 --> 1:44:51.560\n than sort of sovereign self determination.\n\n1:44:51.560 --> 1:44:55.920\n But our country is now I think really in the grip of that.\n\n1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:57.720\n I decide and that's where the Nietzschean thing\n\n1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:00.280\n comes to my mind of the will to power.\n\n1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:01.920\n I'm beyond good and evil.\n\n1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:04.000\n It's just up to me to decide.\n\n1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:05.360\n God help us.\n\n1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:08.120\n No, it's the values that we intuit around us.\n\n1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:11.000\n Intellectual, moral and aesthetic, the values.\n\n1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:12.360\n Think of the dog on the beach again.\n\n1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:15.320\n And that you get ordered to those\n\n1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:18.680\n by your education, by your family, by your religion.\n\n1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:19.560\n And that's beautiful.\n\n1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:20.680\n That makes you free.\n\n1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:23.160\n Now I can freely enter into this.\n\n1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:26.160\n So this sovereign self determination business,\n\n1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:27.140\n that's not my game.\n\n1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:31.560\n The values come in part from the tradition\n\n1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:33.600\n carried through the generations.\n\n1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:36.680\n Let me ask you to put on your wise hat\n\n1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:38.400\n and give advice to young folks.\n\n1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:40.280\n So high school and college,\n\n1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:44.480\n thinking about what to do with their life,\n\n1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:48.600\n career, there's so many options out there.\n\n1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:52.040\n How can they have a career they can be proud of\n\n1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:54.560\n or even just a life they can be proud of?\n\n1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:00.460\n I think I'd say find something you're good at\n\n1:46:00.460 --> 1:46:01.640\n because that's from God.\n\n1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:03.760\n It's a gift that God's given you.\n\n1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:06.140\n And then dedicate it to love.\n\n1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:06.980\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:11.200\n You're good at science or math or sports or whatever.\n\n1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:13.880\n Okay, I'm gonna use that now for my aggrandizement,\n\n1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:17.560\n for my wealth, for my privileges and to become famous.\n\n1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:19.000\n No, no, no, don't.\n\n1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:20.380\n Find what you're good at,\n\n1:46:20.380 --> 1:46:23.780\n but now dedicate it to willing the good of the other.\n\n1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:26.040\n So use your science and use your mathematics\n\n1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:29.080\n and use your sports and use your musicianship\n\n1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:30.840\n to benefit the world.\n\n1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:33.880\n That's how I'd say them.\n\n1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:35.080\n So find what you're good at.\n\n1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:35.920\n That's from God.\n\n1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:37.400\n Well, that's a tricky one.\n\n1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:39.000\n Finding what you're good at\n\n1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.420\n because it's not just raw skill.\n\n1:46:41.420 --> 1:46:43.560\n It's also what you connect with.\n\n1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:47.000\n And it's also like this iterative process\n\n1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.480\n of if you wanna add love to the world,\n\n1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:55.640\n you have to see how can you be effective at doing that.\n\n1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:57.120\n So it's not just the things you're good at.\n\n1:46:57.120 --> 1:47:02.120\n There's like, I'm good at building bridges out of toothpicks.\n\n1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:05.640\n I'm not exactly sure that's going to be useful for the world.\n\n1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:07.840\n Then again, to push back on that,\n\n1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:11.360\n the joy brings me, maybe somehow the joy radiates out.\n\n1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:13.200\n Yeah, well, you're good at what you're doing right now.\n\n1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:16.240\n And you've dedicated that to bringing more light\n\n1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:19.440\n and illumination and joy to the world.\n\n1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:21.040\n That's true.\n\n1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:23.400\n That was a searching.\n\n1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:27.360\n That's a process of trying stuff and figuring it out.\n\n1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:30.760\n And ultimately, yes, asking the question,\n\n1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:32.640\n how is this making the world at all better\n\n1:47:32.640 --> 1:47:34.680\n at every step of the way\n\n1:47:34.680 --> 1:47:36.040\n as opposed to enriching yourself\n\n1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:37.240\n and all those kinds of things?\n\n1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:39.240\n Right, I think that's the name of the game.\n\n1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:40.280\n But it's tricky.\n\n1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:42.200\n And if we don't have moral mentors\n\n1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:44.600\n and intellectual mentors, it becomes hard.\n\n1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:47.320\n And if you tell a kid, that's deadly to me,\n\n1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:50.720\n just decide for yourself, just off you go.\n\n1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:52.800\n And you make your own choices.\n\n1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:55.480\n I mean, your choice has to be disciplined.\n\n1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:57.560\n Your desire has gotta be directed.\n\n1:47:57.560 --> 1:47:59.720\n Then you'll find your creative path.\n\n1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:01.640\n Everyone does it in its own way.\n\n1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:03.880\n But it's a guided choice.\n\n1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:05.880\n Your freedom is not sovereign.\n\n1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:08.080\n It's a guided freedom.\n\n1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:10.480\n So in the struggle and the suffering\n\n1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:11.720\n you've seen in the world,\n\n1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:16.840\n let me ask you the question of death.\n\n1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:22.760\n How often do you think about your own mortality?\n\n1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:23.960\n Every day.\n\n1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:28.960\n And one, are you afraid of it, the uncertainty of it?\n\n1:48:30.200 --> 1:48:32.480\n And what do you think happens after you die?\n\n1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:33.320\n Sure, I'm afraid of it.\n\n1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:37.960\n I mean, because I don't know what's next.\n\n1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:39.920\n I mean, I can't know it the way I know you.\n\n1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:41.600\n So of course I'm afraid of it.\n\n1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:43.520\n And I think of it every day.\n\n1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:44.360\n That's true.\n\n1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:48.440\n My prayer life compels me.\n\n1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:51.360\n We have this, the Hail Mary prayer.\n\n1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:52.560\n So you pray the rosary.\n\n1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:54.320\n Now and at the hour of our death, amen.\n\n1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:56.760\n Now and at the hour of our death, amen.\n\n1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:58.080\n Now at the hour of our death, amen.\n\n1:48:58.080 --> 1:48:59.800\n You pray the whole rosary.\n\n1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:03.440\n 50 times you've reminded yourself of your own death.\n\n1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:04.280\n But I do.\n\n1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:06.440\n I think about it because it's the ultimate limit.\n\n1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:08.960\n It's why it's beguiled every artist and writer\n\n1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:09.800\n and philosopher.\n\n1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:12.600\n It's the ultimate limit question.\n\n1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:14.440\n But yeah, sure.\n\n1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:16.800\n I'm afraid of it because it's the unknown.\n\n1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:19.240\n What do I think happens?\n\n1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:25.200\n I think I'm drawn into the deeper embrace of God's love.\n\n1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:29.200\n You know, that's stating it kind of in a more poetic way.\n\n1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:31.840\n Do you know John Polkinghorne's work?\n\n1:49:31.840 --> 1:49:32.960\n Do you know that name?\n\n1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:34.120\n John Polkinghorne was a very interesting,\n\n1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:35.560\n he just died recently.\n\n1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:38.960\n He was a Cambridge University particle physicist, right?\n\n1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:43.120\n High, high level scientist who at midlife\n\n1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:44.440\n became an Anglican priest.\n\n1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:46.800\n He left his job at Cambridge and went to the seminary\n\n1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:48.640\n and became an Anglican priest, right?\n\n1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:50.560\n And then wrote, I think some of the best stuff\n\n1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:51.400\n on science and religion,\n\n1:49:51.400 --> 1:49:54.040\n because he really knew the science from the inside.\n\n1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:55.440\n Here's Polkinghorne's account\n\n1:49:55.440 --> 1:49:58.080\n that I've always found persuasive.\n\n1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:02.600\n He said, what survives after we die?\n\n1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:06.040\n So this body clearly dies and goes into the ground\n\n1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:08.520\n or it's burned up or it goes away, right?\n\n1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:09.480\n But what's preserved?\n\n1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:12.800\n And he says, what Aristotle would have called the form,\n\n1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:14.560\n Polkinghorne calls it the pattern.\n\n1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:18.560\n So the pattern that's organized the matter\n\n1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:20.320\n that's made me up over all these years,\n\n1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:23.160\n that's obviously not the same as it was even,\n\n1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:25.720\n I mean, you would know how often does it all change,\n\n1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:28.360\n all your atoms and cells and, you know.\n\n1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:30.560\n In other words, the little, you know,\n\n1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:33.720\n Bobby Baron who was growing up in Birmingham, Michigan,\n\n1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:36.000\n I can have a picture of him and then there's me.\n\n1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.400\n And I say, oh, that's the same person.\n\n1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:40.200\n Well, I mean, clearly not materially speaking, not at all.\n\n1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:41.760\n Completely different.\n\n1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:44.640\n But there's a unity to whatever that pattern is\n\n1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:46.880\n by which all of that materiality\n\n1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:48.640\n has been kind of organized, you know?\n\n1:50:48.640 --> 1:50:53.360\n So Polkinghorne says, I think that pattern is remembered\n\n1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:56.160\n by God and remember it's the wrong word,\n\n1:50:56.160 --> 1:50:57.040\n as though it's like derivative.\n\n1:50:57.040 --> 1:50:59.640\n I mean, it's known by God.\n\n1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:03.480\n And so God can therefore reembody me\n\n1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:06.440\n according to that pattern at a higher pitch,\n\n1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:08.160\n what we call the resurrected body.\n\n1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:12.280\n So Paul talks about a spiritual body,\n\n1:51:12.280 --> 1:51:13.440\n body for sure, I mean,\n\n1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:15.840\n because he believes in the resurrection of Jesus.\n\n1:51:15.840 --> 1:51:19.520\n But it's not a body like ours from this world.\n\n1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:22.120\n It's a body at a higher pitch.\n\n1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:26.200\n So something, some pattern that's there persists.\n\n1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:28.640\n Pattern persists in the mind of God\n\n1:51:28.640 --> 1:51:32.440\n and then is used as the ground of the reembodyment of me.\n\n1:51:32.440 --> 1:51:35.560\n So it's not like I've just become a platonic form.\n\n1:51:35.560 --> 1:51:38.320\n I'm gonna be reembodyed because the Christian hope\n\n1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:42.320\n is not for platonic escape of soul from matter.\n\n1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:43.840\n That's never the Christian hope.\n\n1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:45.760\n It's for the resurrection of the body,\n\n1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:46.920\n we say.\n\n1:51:46.920 --> 1:51:48.960\n And you say, what a fantastic idea.\n\n1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:49.940\n Well, I don't know.\n\n1:51:49.940 --> 1:51:53.520\n I mean, this body is being reconstituted all the time\n\n1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:55.480\n according to this pattern, right?\n\n1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:57.180\n It's not the same matter.\n\n1:51:57.180 --> 1:52:02.180\n And so might there be another sort of higher material\n\n1:52:02.380 --> 1:52:04.960\n that is organized according to the same pattern,\n\n1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:06.680\n which has been remembered by God.\n\n1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:09.380\n So therefore we can hang on to the language of body and soul\n\n1:52:09.380 --> 1:52:11.900\n if you want, or matter and form.\n\n1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:14.600\n But it's the form remembered by God\n\n1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:18.080\n and then reconstituted in an embodied way by God\n\n1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:21.360\n that we call heaven, the heavenly state.\n\n1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:22.680\n That's what I hope for.\n\n1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:26.000\n That's my Christian faith, my Christian hope.\n\n1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:29.800\n Let me ask you about the big question of meaning.\n\n1:52:29.800 --> 1:52:32.360\n We've talked about it in different directions\n\n1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:33.800\n from different perspectives.\n\n1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:36.880\n What's the meaning of our existence here on earth?\n\n1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:39.360\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:40.720\n Love.\n\n1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:42.280\n God is love.\n\n1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:45.040\n And the purpose of my life is to become God's friend.\n\n1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:47.320\n And that means I'm more conformed to love.\n\n1:52:47.320 --> 1:52:49.640\n And so my life finds meaning in the measure\n\n1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:52.980\n that I become more on fire with the divine love.\n\n1:52:52.980 --> 1:52:54.080\n I'm like the burning bush,\n\n1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:57.640\n is to become more and more radiant with the presence of God.\n\n1:52:57.640 --> 1:52:59.760\n That's what gives life meaning.\n\n1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:01.960\n Meaning is to live in a purposive relationship\n\n1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:03.160\n to a value, I would say.\n\n1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:04.920\n So there's all kinds of values,\n\n1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:07.720\n as I say, moral, aesthetic, intellectual values.\n\n1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:09.400\n And when I have a purposive relationship,\n\n1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:10.720\n so right now you and I,\n\n1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:12.800\n we have a purposive relationship to the value of,\n\n1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:15.500\n let's say, finding out the truth of things,\n\n1:53:15.500 --> 1:53:18.060\n and we're speaking together to seek that.\n\n1:53:18.060 --> 1:53:19.200\n Well, good.\n\n1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:20.400\n What's the ultimate value?\n\n1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:22.360\n The value of values is God.\n\n1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:25.520\n The supreme good, the supremely knowable,\n\n1:53:25.520 --> 1:53:27.960\n the supremely intelligible is God.\n\n1:53:27.960 --> 1:53:30.120\n And so to be conformed to God\n\n1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:32.520\n is to have a fully meaningful life.\n\n1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:33.820\n And who's God?\n\n1:53:33.820 --> 1:53:34.940\n God is love.\n\n1:53:34.940 --> 1:53:38.040\n So that's where I would fit the package together that way.\n\n1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:41.240\n You're adding a lot of love to this world,\n\n1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:43.320\n and which is something I deeply appreciate,\n\n1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:45.800\n and that you would sit down with me,\n\n1:53:45.800 --> 1:53:47.320\n given how valuable your time is,\n\n1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:48.160\n is a huge honor.\n\n1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:48.980\n Thank you so much for talking to me.\n\n1:53:48.980 --> 1:53:49.820\n Well, my great pleasure.\n\n1:53:49.820 --> 1:53:50.660\n I loved it.\n\n1:53:50.660 --> 1:53:51.580\n Lex, thank you.\n\n1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:53.080\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:54.640\n with Bishop Robert Barron.\n\n1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:55.880\n To support this podcast,\n\n1:53:55.880 --> 1:53:58.560\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:00.840\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:03.120\n from Bishop Robert Barron himself,\n\n1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:05.560\n which reminds me of the Dostoevsky line\n\n1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:07.580\n spoken through Prince Mishkin,\n\n1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:10.800\n that quote, beauty will save the world.\n\n1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:14.740\n Robert says, begin with the beautiful,\n\n1:54:14.740 --> 1:54:16.960\n which leads to the good,\n\n1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:19.080\n which leads you to truth.\n\n1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:21.100\n Thank you for listening,\n\n1:54:21.100 --> 1:54:41.100\n and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
