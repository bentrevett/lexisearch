and co creator of an amazing economics blog\n\n00:08.200 --> 00:11.520\n called Marginal Revolution, author of many books,\n\n00:11.520 --> 00:14.840\n including The Great Stagnation, Average Is Over\n\n00:14.840 --> 00:17.240\n and his most recent Big Business,\n\n00:17.240 --> 00:20.240\n A Love Letter to an American Antihero.\n\n00:20.240 --> 00:22.520\n He's truly a polymath in his work,\n\n00:22.520 --> 00:24.280\n including his love for food,\n\n00:24.280 --> 00:26.440\n which makes this amazing podcast\n\n00:26.440 --> 00:29.960\n called Conversations with Tyler really fun to listen to.\n\n00:30.880 --> 00:32.680\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:32.680 --> 00:37.380\n Linode, ExpressVPN, Simplisafe and Public Goods.\n\n00:37.380 --> 00:41.040\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:41.040 --> 00:45.160\n As a side note, given Tyler's culinary explorations,\n\n00:45.160 --> 00:48.380\n let me say that one of the things that makes me sad\n\n00:48.380 --> 00:51.040\n about my love hate relationship with food\n\n00:51.040 --> 00:53.840\n is that while I've found a simple diet,\n\n00:53.840 --> 00:58.200\n plain meat, veggies, that makes me happy in day to day life,\n\n00:58.200 --> 01:00.120\n I sometimes wish I had the mental ability\n\n01:00.120 --> 01:02.040\n to moderate consumption of food\n\n01:02.040 --> 01:03.760\n so that I could truly enjoy meals\n\n01:03.760 --> 01:06.120\n that go way outside of that diet.\n\n01:06.120 --> 01:07.520\n I've seen my mom, for example,\n\n01:07.520 --> 01:09.680\n enjoy a single piece of chocolate\n\n01:09.680 --> 01:12.500\n and yet if I were to eat one piece of chocolate,\n\n01:12.500 --> 01:15.940\n the odds are high that I would end up eating the whole box.\n\n01:15.940 --> 01:18.200\n This is definitely something I would like to fix\n\n01:18.200 --> 01:21.840\n because some of the amazing artistry in this world\n\n01:21.840 --> 01:24.160\n happens in the kitchen and some of the richest\n\n01:24.160 --> 01:27.560\n human experiences happen over a unique meal.\n\n01:27.560 --> 01:29.360\n I recently was eating cheeseburgers\n\n01:29.360 --> 01:33.520\n with Joe Rogan and John Donahue late at night in Austin,\n\n01:33.520 --> 01:35.680\n talking about jiu jitsu and life\n\n01:35.680 --> 01:40.160\n and I was distinctly aware of the magic of that experience.\n\n01:40.160 --> 01:42.640\n Magic made possible by the incredibly\n\n01:42.640 --> 01:44.460\n delicious cheeseburgers.\n\n01:44.460 --> 01:47.120\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast\n\n01:47.120 --> 01:50.060\n and here is my conversation with Tyler Cohen.\n\n01:50.060 --> 01:54.420\n Would you say economics is more art or science\n\n01:54.420 --> 01:57.100\n or philosophy or even magic?\n\n01:57.100 --> 01:58.120\n What is it?\n\n01:58.120 --> 02:01.460\n Economics is interesting because it's all of the above.\n\n02:01.460 --> 02:03.900\n To start with magic, the notion that you can\n\n02:03.900 --> 02:06.620\n make some change and simply everyone's better off,\n\n02:06.620 --> 02:08.420\n that is a kind of modern magic\n\n02:08.420 --> 02:11.020\n that has replaced old style magic.\n\n02:11.020 --> 02:14.620\n It's an art in the sense that the models are not very exact.\n\n02:14.620 --> 02:16.580\n It's a science in the sense that occasionally\n\n02:16.580 --> 02:18.540\n propositions are falsified.\n\n02:18.540 --> 02:20.860\n Are a few basic things we know\n\n02:20.860 --> 02:22.360\n and however trivial they may sound,\n\n02:22.360 --> 02:24.580\n if you don't know them, you're out of luck.\n\n02:24.580 --> 02:26.480\n So all of the above.\n\n02:26.480 --> 02:28.580\n But from my outsider's perspective,\n\n02:28.580 --> 02:33.580\n economics is sometimes able to formulate very simple,\n\n02:33.740 --> 02:36.100\n almost like E equals MC squared,\n\n02:36.100 --> 02:40.020\n general models of how our human society will function\n\n02:40.020 --> 02:41.760\n when you do a certain thing.\n\n02:42.800 --> 02:47.420\n But it seems impossible or almost way too optimistic\n\n02:47.420 --> 02:49.420\n to think that a single formula\n\n02:49.420 --> 02:51.620\n or just a set of simple principles\n\n02:51.620 --> 02:56.460\n can describe behavior of billions of human beings\n\n02:56.460 --> 02:58.620\n with all the complexity that we have involved.\n\n02:58.620 --> 03:01.220\n So do you have a sense there's a hope for economics\n\n03:01.220 --> 03:06.220\n to have those kinds of physics level descriptions\n\n03:06.740 --> 03:08.100\n and models of the world?\n\n03:08.100 --> 03:10.060\n Or is it just our desperate attempts as humans\n\n03:10.060 --> 03:12.980\n to make sense of it even though it's more desperate\n\n03:12.980 --> 03:17.980\n than rigorous and serious and actually predictable\n\n03:17.980 --> 03:20.540\n like a physics type science?\n\n03:20.540 --> 03:24.160\n I don't think economics will ever be very predictive.\n\n03:24.160 --> 03:27.260\n It's most useful for helping you ask better questions.\n\n03:27.260 --> 03:29.420\n You look at something like game theory.\n\n03:29.420 --> 03:32.660\n Well, game theory never predicted USA and USSR\n\n03:32.660 --> 03:35.060\n would have a war, would not have a war.\n\n03:35.060 --> 03:38.140\n But trying to think through the logic of strategic conflict,\n\n03:38.140 --> 03:39.460\n if you know game theory,\n\n03:39.460 --> 03:42.500\n it's just a much more interesting discussion.\n\n03:42.500 --> 03:44.540\n Are you surprised that we,\n\n03:44.540 --> 03:47.420\n speaking of the Soviet Union and the United States\n\n03:47.420 --> 03:48.780\n and speaking of game theory,\n\n03:48.780 --> 03:50.900\n are you surprised that we haven't destroyed ourselves\n\n03:50.900 --> 03:52.020\n with nuclear weapons yet?\n\n03:52.020 --> 03:54.280\n Like that simple formulation\n\n03:54.280 --> 03:56.300\n of mutually assured destruction,\n\n03:56.300 --> 03:58.940\n that's a good example of an explanation\n\n03:58.940 --> 04:02.340\n that perhaps allows us to ask better questions.\n\n04:02.340 --> 04:06.100\n But it seems to have actually described the reality\n\n04:06.100 --> 04:08.340\n of why we haven't destroyed ourselves\n\n04:08.340 --> 04:10.820\n with these ultra powerful weapons.\n\n04:10.820 --> 04:13.100\n Are you surprised, do you think\n\n04:13.100 --> 04:16.880\n the game theoretic explanation is at all accurate there?\n\n04:16.880 --> 04:19.920\n I think we will destroy each other with those weapons.\n\n04:19.920 --> 04:20.760\n Eventually.\n\n04:20.760 --> 04:21.940\n Eventually.\n\n04:21.940 --> 04:24.320\n Look, it's a very low probability event.\n\n04:24.320 --> 04:26.700\n So I'm not surprised it hasn't happened yet.\n\n04:26.700 --> 04:29.500\n I'm a little surprised it came as close as it did.\n\n04:29.500 --> 04:30.980\n You know, you're general thinking,\n\n04:30.980 --> 04:33.100\n realizing it might've just been a flock of birds\n\n04:33.100 --> 04:35.700\n or it wasn't a first strike attack from the USA.\n\n04:35.700 --> 04:38.060\n We got very lucky on that one.\n\n04:38.060 --> 04:39.940\n But if you just keep on running the clock\n\n04:39.940 --> 04:42.900\n on a low probability event, it will happen.\n\n04:42.900 --> 04:45.620\n And it may not be USA and China,\n\n04:45.620 --> 04:47.160\n USA and Russia, whatever.\n\n04:47.160 --> 04:49.200\n You know, it could be the Saudis and Turkey.\n\n04:49.200 --> 04:50.580\n And it might not be nuclear weapons,\n\n04:50.580 --> 04:51.580\n it might be some other destruction.\n\n04:51.580 --> 04:52.740\n Bio weapons.\n\n04:52.740 --> 04:55.580\n But it simply will happen is my view.\n\n04:55.580 --> 04:58.820\n And I've argued at best we have 700 or 800 years\n\n04:58.820 --> 05:00.240\n and that's being generous.\n\n05:00.240 --> 05:01.080\n A worst?\n\n05:01.080 --> 05:03.020\n How long we got?\n\n05:03.020 --> 05:06.380\n Well, maybe it's like a post on arrival process, right?\n\n05:06.380 --> 05:09.540\n So tiny probability could come any time.\n\n05:09.540 --> 05:12.020\n Probably not in your lifetime.\n\n05:12.020 --> 05:15.700\n But the chance presumably increases\n\n05:15.700 --> 05:18.780\n the cheaper weapons of mass destruction are.\n\n05:18.780 --> 05:22.380\n So the Poisson process description doesn't take\n\n05:22.380 --> 05:24.340\n in consideration the game theoretic aspect.\n\n05:24.340 --> 05:28.060\n So another way to consider is repeated games,\n\n05:28.060 --> 05:29.700\n iterative games.\n\n05:29.700 --> 05:33.440\n So is there something about our human nature\n\n05:33.440 --> 05:37.260\n that allows us to fight against probability?\n\n05:37.260 --> 05:40.940\n Reduce, like the closer we get to trouble,\n\n05:40.940 --> 05:43.840\n the more we're able to figure out how to avoid trouble.\n\n05:43.840 --> 05:46.140\n The same thing is for when you take exams\n\n05:46.140 --> 05:48.700\n or you go and take classes,\n\n05:48.700 --> 05:50.620\n the closer or paper deadlines,\n\n05:50.620 --> 05:52.220\n the closer you get to a deadline,\n\n05:52.220 --> 05:53.480\n the better you start to perform\n\n05:53.480 --> 05:56.220\n and get your shit together and actually get stuff done.\n\n05:56.220 --> 05:58.720\n I'm really not so negative on human nature.\n\n05:58.720 --> 05:59.760\n And as an economist,\n\n05:59.760 --> 06:02.900\n I very much see the gains from cooperation.\n\n06:02.900 --> 06:05.260\n But if you just ask, are there outliers in history?\n\n06:05.260 --> 06:07.100\n Like was there a Hitler, for instance?\n\n06:07.100 --> 06:08.140\n Obviously.\n\n06:08.140 --> 06:09.980\n And again, you let the clock tick,\n\n06:09.980 --> 06:12.260\n another Hitler with nuclear weapons,\n\n06:12.260 --> 06:15.140\n doesn't per se care about his own destruction,\n\n06:15.140 --> 06:16.460\n it will happen.\n\n06:16.460 --> 06:19.300\n So your sense is fundamentally people are good,\n\n06:20.240 --> 06:21.080\n but outliers happen.\n\n06:21.080 --> 06:23.480\n A trembling hand equilibrium is what we would call it.\n\n06:23.480 --> 06:25.420\n Trembling hand equilibrium?\n\n06:25.420 --> 06:28.460\n That the basic logic is for cooperation,\n\n06:28.460 --> 06:32.420\n which is mostly what we've seen, even between enemies.\n\n06:32.420 --> 06:35.020\n But every now and then someone does something crazy\n\n06:35.020 --> 06:36.800\n and you don't know how to react to it.\n\n06:36.800 --> 06:39.500\n And you can't always beat Hitler.\n\n06:39.500 --> 06:41.680\n Sometimes Hitler drags you down.\n\n06:41.680 --> 06:44.620\n To push back, is it possible\n\n06:44.620 --> 06:48.880\n that the crazier the person, the less likely they are,\n\n06:49.700 --> 06:52.900\n and in a way where we're safe,\n\n06:52.900 --> 06:56.500\n meaning like, this is the kind of proposition,\n\n06:56.500 --> 06:59.580\n I had the discussion with my dad as a physicist about this,\n\n06:59.580 --> 07:04.580\n where he thinks that like if you have a graph,\n\n07:04.580 --> 07:08.220\n like evil people can't also be geniuses.\n\n07:08.220 --> 07:11.060\n So this is his defense why evil people\n\n07:11.060 --> 07:13.380\n will not get control of nuclear weapons,\n\n07:13.380 --> 07:15.000\n because to be truly evil.\n\n07:15.940 --> 07:19.700\n But evil meaning sort of, you can argue that,\n\n07:19.700 --> 07:22.420\n not even the evil of Hitler we're talking about,\n\n07:22.420 --> 07:24.500\n because Hitler had a kind of view of Germany\n\n07:24.500 --> 07:26.460\n and all those kinds of, there's like,\n\n07:26.460 --> 07:29.540\n he probably deluded himself and the people around him\n\n07:29.540 --> 07:31.340\n to think that he's actually doing good for the world,\n\n07:31.340 --> 07:33.180\n similar with Stalin and so on.\n\n07:33.180 --> 07:35.740\n By evil, I mean more like almost like terrorists\n\n07:35.740 --> 07:39.820\n to where they wanna destroy themselves and the world.\n\n07:39.820 --> 07:42.820\n Like those people will never be able to be\n\n07:42.820 --> 07:44.820\n actually skilled enough to do,\n\n07:44.820 --> 07:47.880\n to deliver that kind of mass scale destruction.\n\n07:47.880 --> 07:52.720\n So the hope is that it's very unlikely\n\n07:52.720 --> 07:55.460\n that the kind of evil that would lead to extinctions\n\n07:55.460 --> 07:59.500\n of humans or mass destruction is so unlikely\n\n07:59.500 --> 08:03.680\n that we're able to last way longer than some 100, 800 years.\n\n08:03.680 --> 08:04.520\n Is that?\n\n08:04.520 --> 08:06.060\n It's very unlikely.\n\n08:06.060 --> 08:08.180\n In that sense, I accept the argument,\n\n08:08.180 --> 08:10.540\n but that's why you need to let the clock tick.\n\n08:10.540 --> 08:13.180\n It's also the best argument for bureaucracy.\n\n08:13.180 --> 08:14.760\n To negotiate a bureaucracy,\n\n08:14.760 --> 08:16.980\n it actually selects against pure evil\n\n08:16.980 --> 08:18.860\n because you need to build alliances.\n\n08:18.860 --> 08:21.020\n So bureaucracy in that regard is great, right?\n\n08:21.020 --> 08:23.300\n It keeps out the worst apples.\n\n08:23.300 --> 08:24.340\n But look, put it this way,\n\n08:24.340 --> 08:26.980\n could you imagine 35 years from now,\n\n08:26.980 --> 08:29.680\n the Osama bin Laden of the future\n\n08:29.680 --> 08:32.540\n has nukes or very bad bio weapons?\n\n08:32.540 --> 08:34.180\n It seems to me you can.\n\n08:34.180 --> 08:36.020\n And Osama was pretty evil.\n\n08:36.020 --> 08:38.720\n And actually even he failed, right?\n\n08:38.720 --> 08:41.780\n But nonetheless, that's what the 700 or 800 years\n\n08:41.780 --> 08:42.980\n is there for.\n\n08:42.980 --> 08:44.940\n And there might be destructive technologies\n\n08:44.940 --> 08:48.660\n that don't have such a high cost of production\n\n08:48.660 --> 08:50.740\n or such a high learning curve.\n\n08:50.740 --> 08:53.940\n Like cyber attacks or artificial intelligence,\n\n08:53.940 --> 08:55.620\n all those kinds of things.\n\n08:55.620 --> 08:56.460\n Yeah.\n\n08:56.460 --> 08:57.580\n I mean, let me ask you a question.\n\n08:57.580 --> 09:00.060\n Let's say you could as an act of will,\n\n09:00.060 --> 09:01.660\n by spending a million dollars,\n\n09:01.660 --> 09:05.300\n obliterate any city on earth and everyone in it dies.\n\n09:05.300 --> 09:08.460\n And you'll get caught and you'll be sentenced to death,\n\n09:08.460 --> 09:10.980\n but you can make it happen just by willing it.\n\n09:10.980 --> 09:13.980\n How many months does it take before that happens?\n\n09:15.900 --> 09:18.020\n So the obvious answer is like very soon.\n\n09:18.020 --> 09:19.420\n There's probably a good answer for that\n\n09:19.420 --> 09:21.460\n because you can consider how many millionaires there are,\n\n09:21.460 --> 09:22.740\n how many you could look at that, right?\n\n09:22.740 --> 09:23.660\n Right.\n\n09:23.660 --> 09:26.620\n I have a sense that there's just people\n\n09:26.620 --> 09:28.620\n that have a million dollars.\n\n09:30.220 --> 09:31.420\n I mean, there's a certain amount,\n\n09:31.420 --> 09:33.660\n but have a million dollars,\n\n09:33.660 --> 09:36.820\n have other interests that will outweigh\n\n09:39.020 --> 09:42.020\n the interest of destroying an entire city.\n\n09:42.020 --> 09:43.980\n Like there's a particular,\n\n09:43.980 --> 09:46.620\n like, I mean, maybe that's a hope.\n\n09:46.620 --> 09:48.900\n It's why we should be nice to the wealthy too, right?\n\n09:48.900 --> 09:51.300\n Yeah.\n\n09:51.300 --> 09:53.900\n Yeah, all that trash talking as Bill Gates,\n\n09:53.900 --> 09:54.780\n we should stop that\n\n09:54.780 --> 09:58.580\n because that doesn't inspire the other future Bill Gates\n\n09:58.580 --> 10:00.100\n is to be nice to the world.\n\n10:01.020 --> 10:01.940\n That's true.\n\n10:01.940 --> 10:05.380\n But your sense is the cheaper it gets to destroy the world,\n\n10:05.380 --> 10:07.460\n the more likely it becomes.\n\n10:07.460 --> 10:08.900\n Now, when I say destroy the world,\n\n10:08.900 --> 10:09.740\n there's a trick in there.\n\n10:09.740 --> 10:12.740\n I don't think literally every human will die,\n\n10:12.740 --> 10:14.940\n but it would set back civilization\n\n10:14.940 --> 10:16.380\n by an extraordinary degree.\n\n10:16.380 --> 10:19.260\n It's then just hard to predict what comes next.\n\n10:19.260 --> 10:21.580\n But a catastrophe where everyone dies,\n\n10:21.580 --> 10:24.100\n that probably has to be something more like an asteroid\n\n10:24.100 --> 10:26.140\n or supernova.\n\n10:26.140 --> 10:29.660\n And those are purely exogenous for the time being, at least.\n\n10:29.660 --> 10:32.180\n So I immigrated to this country.\n\n10:32.180 --> 10:36.100\n I was born in the Soviet Union in Russia and...\n\n10:36.100 --> 10:37.140\n Which one?\n\n10:37.140 --> 10:37.980\n Which one?\n\n10:37.980 --> 10:39.620\n I guess it's an important question.\n\n10:39.620 --> 10:41.460\n You were born in the Soviet Union, right?\n\n10:41.460 --> 10:43.340\n Yes, I was born in the Soviet Union.\n\n10:43.340 --> 10:47.500\n The rest is details, but I grew up in Moscow, Russia.\n\n10:47.500 --> 10:49.860\n But I came to this country,\n\n10:49.860 --> 10:52.140\n and this country even back there,\n\n10:52.140 --> 10:55.820\n but it's always symbolized to me a place of opportunity\n\n10:55.820 --> 11:00.820\n where everybody could build the most incredible things,\n\n11:01.140 --> 11:03.380\n especially in the engineering side of things.\n\n11:03.380 --> 11:06.540\n Just invent and build and scale\n\n11:06.540 --> 11:08.700\n and have a huge impact on the world.\n\n11:08.700 --> 11:11.060\n And that's been, to me, the...\n\n11:11.060 --> 11:14.060\n That's my version of the American ideal, the American dream.\n\n11:14.060 --> 11:19.060\n Do you think the American dream is still there?\n\n11:20.340 --> 11:21.180\n Do you think...\n\n11:21.180 --> 11:23.540\n What do you think of that notion in itself,\n\n11:23.540 --> 11:25.180\n like from an economics perspective,\n\n11:25.180 --> 11:28.180\n from a human perspective, is it still alive?\n\n11:28.180 --> 11:30.020\n And how do you think about it?\n\n11:30.020 --> 11:30.860\n The American dream.\n\n11:30.860 --> 11:33.540\n The American dream is mostly still there.\n\n11:33.540 --> 11:37.340\n If you look at which groups are the highest earners,\n\n11:37.340 --> 11:41.340\n it is individuals from India and individuals from Iran,\n\n11:41.340 --> 11:43.300\n which is a fairly new development.\n\n11:43.300 --> 11:45.940\n Great for them, not necessarily easy.\n\n11:45.940 --> 11:48.540\n Both you could call persons of color,\n\n11:48.540 --> 11:50.300\n may have faced discrimination,\n\n11:50.300 --> 11:53.780\n also on the grounds of religion, yet they've done it.\n\n11:53.780 --> 11:54.620\n That's amazing.\n\n11:54.620 --> 11:56.540\n It says great things about America.\n\n11:56.540 --> 11:58.580\n Now, if you look at native born Americans,\n\n11:58.580 --> 12:00.580\n the story's trickier.\n\n12:00.580 --> 12:03.660\n People think intergenerational mobility\n\n12:03.660 --> 12:05.260\n has declined a lot recently,\n\n12:05.260 --> 12:08.580\n but it has not for native born Americans.\n\n12:08.580 --> 12:11.820\n For about, I think, 40 years, it's been fairly constant,\n\n12:11.820 --> 12:13.700\n which is sort of good,\n\n12:13.700 --> 12:16.900\n but compared to much earlier times,\n\n12:16.900 --> 12:19.340\n it was much higher in the past.\n\n12:19.340 --> 12:20.940\n I'm not sure we can replicate that,\n\n12:20.940 --> 12:23.460\n because look, go to the beginning of the 20th century,\n\n12:23.460 --> 12:25.660\n very few Americans finish high school,\n\n12:26.700 --> 12:27.860\n or even have much wealth.\n\n12:27.860 --> 12:29.180\n There's not much credentialism.\n\n12:29.180 --> 12:30.860\n There aren't that many credentials.\n\n12:30.860 --> 12:33.020\n So there's more upward mobility\n\n12:33.020 --> 12:35.660\n across the generations than today.\n\n12:35.660 --> 12:37.300\n And it's a good thing that we had it.\n\n12:37.300 --> 12:40.140\n I'm not sure we should blame the modern world\n\n12:40.140 --> 12:43.300\n for not being able to reproduce that.\n\n12:43.300 --> 12:45.460\n But look, the general issue of\n\n12:45.460 --> 12:47.660\n who gets into Harvard or Cornell?\n\n12:47.660 --> 12:49.340\n Is there an injustice?\n\n12:49.340 --> 12:50.700\n Should we fix that?\n\n12:50.700 --> 12:52.780\n Is there too little opportunity for the bottom,\n\n12:52.780 --> 12:54.340\n say, half of Americans?\n\n12:54.340 --> 12:55.460\n Absolutely.\n\n12:55.460 --> 12:58.740\n It's a disgrace how this country has evolved in that way.\n\n12:58.740 --> 13:01.940\n And in that sense, the American dream is clearly ailing.\n\n13:01.940 --> 13:04.420\n But it has had problems from the beginning,\n\n13:04.420 --> 13:07.100\n for blacks, for women, for many other groups.\n\n13:07.100 --> 13:10.060\n I mean, isn't that the whole challenge of opportunity\n\n13:10.060 --> 13:12.060\n and freedom is that it's hard,\n\n13:12.060 --> 13:16.780\n and the difficulty of how hard it is to move up in society\n\n13:16.780 --> 13:20.260\n is unequal often, and that's the injustice of society.\n\n13:20.260 --> 13:23.100\n But the whole point of that freedom\n\n13:23.100 --> 13:25.660\n is that over time, it becomes better and better.\n\n13:25.660 --> 13:30.660\n You start to fix the leaks, the issues,\n\n13:31.300 --> 13:35.140\n and it keeps progressing in that kind of way.\n\n13:35.140 --> 13:37.340\n But ultimately, there's always the opportunity,\n\n13:37.340 --> 13:39.860\n even if it's harder, there's the opportunity\n\n13:39.860 --> 13:41.780\n to create something truly special,\n\n13:41.780 --> 13:46.660\n to move up, to be president, to be a leader\n\n13:46.660 --> 13:49.020\n in whatever the industry that you're passionate about.\n\n13:49.020 --> 13:51.460\n We each have podcasts, right, in English.\n\n13:51.460 --> 13:56.060\n The value of joining that American English language network\n\n13:56.060 --> 13:58.260\n is much higher today than it was 30 years ago,\n\n13:58.260 --> 14:00.300\n mostly because of the internet.\n\n14:00.300 --> 14:03.860\n So that makes immigration returns themselves skewed.\n\n14:03.860 --> 14:07.180\n So going to the US, Canada, or the UK,\n\n14:07.180 --> 14:09.940\n I think has become much more valuable in relative terms\n\n14:09.940 --> 14:11.340\n than, say, going to France,\n\n14:11.340 --> 14:13.860\n which is still a pretty well off, very nice country.\n\n14:16.580 --> 14:17.700\n If you had gone to France,\n\n14:17.700 --> 14:20.180\n your chance of having a globally known podcast\n\n14:20.180 --> 14:21.740\n would be much smaller.\n\n14:21.740 --> 14:23.700\n Yeah, this is the interesting thing\n\n14:24.820 --> 14:27.660\n about how much intellectual influence\n\n14:27.660 --> 14:28.580\n the United States has.\n\n14:28.580 --> 14:31.940\n I don't know if it's connected to what we're discussing here,\n\n14:31.940 --> 14:34.980\n the freedom and opportunity of the American dream,\n\n14:34.980 --> 14:37.380\n or does it make any sense to you\n\n14:37.380 --> 14:41.300\n that we have so much impact on the rest of the world\n\n14:41.300 --> 14:44.100\n in terms of ideas?\n\n14:45.500 --> 14:47.540\n Is it just simply because English\n\n14:47.540 --> 14:49.740\n is the primary language of the world,\n\n14:49.740 --> 14:52.100\n or is there something fundamental to the United States\n\n14:52.100 --> 14:55.500\n that drives the development of ideas?\n\n14:55.500 --> 14:59.780\n It's almost like what's cool, what's entertaining,\n\n14:59.780 --> 15:04.780\n what's like meme culture, the internet culture,\n\n15:06.220 --> 15:09.220\n the philosophers, the intellectuals, the podcasts,\n\n15:09.220 --> 15:13.300\n the movies, music, all that stuff, driving culture.\n\n15:13.300 --> 15:15.140\n There's something above and beyond language\n\n15:15.140 --> 15:16.620\n in the United States.\n\n15:16.620 --> 15:19.140\n It's a sense of entertainment really mattering,\n\n15:19.140 --> 15:20.940\n how to connect with your audience,\n\n15:20.940 --> 15:22.860\n being direct and getting to the point,\n\n15:23.700 --> 15:27.260\n how humor is integrated even with science\n\n15:27.260 --> 15:30.300\n that is pretty strongly represented here,\n\n15:30.300 --> 15:32.660\n much more so than on the European continent.\n\n15:32.660 --> 15:34.300\n Britain has its own version of this,\n\n15:34.300 --> 15:36.140\n which it does very well,\n\n15:36.140 --> 15:38.340\n and not surprisingly, they're hugely influential\n\n15:38.340 --> 15:41.940\n in music, comedy, most of the other areas you mentioned.\n\n15:41.940 --> 15:44.820\n Canada, yes, but their best talent tends to come here,\n\n15:44.820 --> 15:47.980\n but you could say it's like a broader North American thing\n\n15:47.980 --> 15:50.220\n and give them their fair share of credit.\n\n15:50.220 --> 15:52.180\n What about science?\n\n15:52.180 --> 15:56.700\n There's a sense higher education is really strong,\n\n15:56.700 --> 15:58.660\n research is really strong in the United States,\n\n15:58.660 --> 16:01.940\n but it just feels like, culturally speaking,\n\n16:01.940 --> 16:06.060\n when we zoom out, scientists aren't very cool here.\n\n16:07.540 --> 16:09.460\n Most people wouldn't be able to name\n\n16:09.460 --> 16:11.180\n basically a single scientist.\n\n16:11.180 --> 16:13.260\n Maybe they would say like, they would say what,\n\n16:13.260 --> 16:16.620\n like Einstein and Neil deGrasse Tyson maybe,\n\n16:16.620 --> 16:18.820\n and Neil deGrasse Tyson isn't exactly a scientist,\n\n16:18.820 --> 16:20.420\n he's a science communicator.\n\n16:20.420 --> 16:25.420\n So there's not the same kind of admiration\n\n16:25.420 --> 16:30.060\n of science and innovators as there is of like,\n\n16:30.060 --> 16:34.980\n athletes or actors, actresses, musicians.\n\n16:34.980 --> 16:38.060\n Well, you can become a celebrity scientist if you want to.\n\n16:38.060 --> 16:40.180\n It may or may not be best for science.\n\n16:40.180 --> 16:44.340\n And we have Spock from Star Trek, who is still a big deal,\n\n16:44.340 --> 16:45.780\n but look at it this way.\n\n16:45.780 --> 16:47.420\n Which country is most comfortable\n\n16:47.420 --> 16:50.900\n with inegalitarian rewards for scientists,\n\n16:50.900 --> 16:52.420\n whether it's fame or money?\n\n16:52.420 --> 16:53.420\n And I still think it's here.\n\n16:53.420 --> 16:55.380\n Some of that's just the tax rate.\n\n16:55.380 --> 16:57.700\n Some of it is a lot of America is set up\n\n16:57.700 --> 17:00.220\n for rich people to live really well.\n\n17:00.220 --> 17:02.740\n And again, that's going to attract a lot of top talent.\n\n17:02.740 --> 17:05.220\n And you ask like, the two best vaccines.\n\n17:05.220 --> 17:08.020\n I know the Pfizer vaccine is sort of from Germany,\n\n17:08.020 --> 17:11.180\n sort of from Turkey, but it's nonetheless\n\n17:11.180 --> 17:13.260\n being distributed through the United States.\n\n17:13.260 --> 17:17.860\n Moderna, an ethnic Armenian immigrant through Lebanon,\n\n17:17.860 --> 17:21.380\n first to Canada, then down here to Boston, Cambridge area.\n\n17:21.380 --> 17:22.820\n Those are incredible vaccines.\n\n17:22.820 --> 17:25.180\n And US nailed it.\n\n17:25.180 --> 17:28.780\n Yeah, well, that's more almost like the,\n\n17:28.780 --> 17:29.940\n I don't know what you would call it,\n\n17:29.940 --> 17:32.700\n engineering, the sort of scaling.\n\n17:32.700 --> 17:34.660\n That's what US is really good at,\n\n17:34.660 --> 17:36.100\n not just inventing of ideas,\n\n17:36.100 --> 17:38.220\n but taking an idea and actually building the thing\n\n17:38.220 --> 17:41.620\n and scaling it and being able to distribute it at scale.\n\n17:42.580 --> 17:44.980\n I think some people would attribute that\n\n17:44.980 --> 17:49.580\n to the general word of capitalism.\n\n17:49.580 --> 17:51.260\n I don't know if you would.\n\n17:51.260 --> 17:52.100\n Sure.\n\n17:52.100 --> 17:57.100\n What in your views are the pros and cons of capitalism\n\n17:57.500 --> 17:59.740\n as it's implemented in America?\n\n17:59.740 --> 18:00.620\n I don't know if you would say\n\n18:00.620 --> 18:03.140\n capitalism really exists in America,\n\n18:03.140 --> 18:04.820\n but to the extent that it does.\n\n18:04.820 --> 18:08.380\n People use the word capitalism in so many different ways.\n\n18:08.380 --> 18:09.820\n What is capitalism?\n\n18:09.820 --> 18:13.500\n The literal meaning is private ownership of capital goods,\n\n18:13.500 --> 18:15.940\n which I favor in most areas.\n\n18:15.940 --> 18:17.700\n But no, I don't think the private sector\n\n18:17.700 --> 18:20.840\n should own our F16s or military assets.\n\n18:20.840 --> 18:23.860\n Government owned water utilities seem to work\n\n18:23.860 --> 18:26.820\n as well as privately owned water utilities.\n\n18:26.820 --> 18:29.620\n But with all those qualifications put to the side,\n\n18:30.980 --> 18:33.740\n business, for the most part,\n\n18:33.740 --> 18:35.280\n innovates better than government.\n\n18:35.280 --> 18:38.120\n It is oriented toward consumer services.\n\n18:38.120 --> 18:41.260\n The biggest businesses tend to pay the highest wages.\n\n18:41.260 --> 18:43.660\n Business is great at getting things done.\n\n18:43.660 --> 18:46.500\n USA is fundamentally a nation of business\n\n18:46.500 --> 18:49.140\n and that makes us a nation of opportunity.\n\n18:49.140 --> 18:51.780\n So I am indeed mostly a fan.\n\n18:51.780 --> 18:54.000\n Subject to numerous caveats.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.300\n What's the con?\n\n18:56.300 --> 18:59.140\n What are some negative downsides of capitalism\n\n19:00.300 --> 19:03.860\n in your view or some things that we should be concerned\n\n19:03.860 --> 19:06.320\n about maybe for longterm impacts of capitalism?\n\n19:07.740 --> 19:10.860\n Again, capitalism takes a different form in each country.\n\n19:10.860 --> 19:12.940\n I would say in the United States,\n\n19:12.940 --> 19:16.120\n our weird blend of whatever you want to call it\n\n19:16.120 --> 19:20.160\n has had an enduring racial problem from the beginning,\n\n19:20.160 --> 19:22.740\n has been a force of taking away land\n\n19:22.740 --> 19:25.460\n from Native Americans and oppressing them\n\n19:25.460 --> 19:27.180\n pretty much from the beginning.\n\n19:30.180 --> 19:34.060\n It has done very well by immigrants for the most part.\n\n19:35.020 --> 19:38.960\n We revel in championitarian creative destruction more.\n\n19:38.960 --> 19:42.260\n So we don't just prop up national champions forever.\n\n19:42.260 --> 19:45.440\n And there's a precariousness to life for some people here\n\n19:45.440 --> 19:48.980\n that is less so say in Germany or the Netherlands.\n\n19:48.980 --> 19:51.780\n We have weaker communities in some regards\n\n19:51.780 --> 19:54.460\n than say Northwestern Europe often would.\n\n19:54.460 --> 19:55.860\n That has pluses and minuses.\n\n19:55.860 --> 19:57.780\n I think it makes us more creative.\n\n19:57.780 --> 20:00.420\n It's a better country in which to be a weirdo\n\n20:00.420 --> 20:02.380\n than say Germany or Denmark.\n\n20:02.380 --> 20:05.500\n But there is truly, whether from the government\n\n20:05.500 --> 20:06.980\n or from your private community,\n\n20:06.980 --> 20:10.060\n there is less social security in some fundamental sense.\n\n20:10.060 --> 20:11.500\n On the point of weirdo,\n\n20:11.500 --> 20:15.380\n what, that's kind of a beautiful little statement.\n\n20:16.340 --> 20:19.460\n What is that?\n\n20:19.460 --> 20:21.460\n I mean, that seems to be, you know,\n\n20:21.460 --> 20:23.580\n you could think of a guy like Elon Musk\n\n20:23.580 --> 20:25.180\n and say that he's a weirdo.\n\n20:25.180 --> 20:27.180\n Is that the sense in which you're using weirdo\n\n20:27.180 --> 20:30.420\n like outside of the norm, like breaking conventions?\n\n20:30.420 --> 20:31.260\n Absolutely.\n\n20:31.260 --> 20:35.340\n And here that is either acceptable or even admired\n\n20:35.340 --> 20:36.700\n or to be a loner.\n\n20:36.700 --> 20:39.380\n And since so many people are outsiders\n\n20:39.380 --> 20:41.980\n and that we're all immigrants is selecting for people\n\n20:41.980 --> 20:43.200\n who left something behind,\n\n20:43.200 --> 20:45.480\n we're willing to leave behind their families,\n\n20:45.480 --> 20:48.220\n we're willing to undergo a certain brutality\n\n20:48.220 --> 20:50.760\n of switch in their lives,\n\n20:50.760 --> 20:55.020\n makes us a nation of weirdos and weirdos are creative.\n\n20:55.020 --> 20:58.060\n And Denmark is not a nation of weirdos.\n\n20:58.060 --> 21:01.100\n It's a wonderful place, you know, great for them.\n\n21:01.100 --> 21:02.580\n Ideally you want part of the world\n\n21:02.580 --> 21:04.460\n to be full of weirdos and innovating.\n\n21:04.460 --> 21:06.500\n And the other part of the world to be a little\n\n21:06.500 --> 21:09.660\n kind of chicken shit, risk averse\n\n21:09.660 --> 21:12.020\n and enjoy the benefit to the innovation\n\n21:12.020 --> 21:13.980\n and to give people these smooth lives\n\n21:13.980 --> 21:16.580\n and six weeks off and free ride.\n\n21:16.580 --> 21:19.340\n And everyone's like, oh, American way versus European way,\n\n21:19.340 --> 21:21.500\n but basically they're compliments.\n\n21:21.500 --> 21:22.420\n Yeah, that's fascinating.\n\n21:22.420 --> 21:25.660\n I used to have this conversation with my like parents\n\n21:25.660 --> 21:27.460\n when I was growing up and just others\n\n21:27.460 --> 21:29.840\n from the immigrant kind of flow.\n\n21:29.840 --> 21:32.780\n And they use this term, especially in Russian is,\n\n21:32.780 --> 21:36.500\n you know, to criticize something I was doing,\n\n21:36.500 --> 21:39.400\n that was suggest, you know, normal people don't do this.\n\n21:41.120 --> 21:43.500\n And I used to be really offended by that,\n\n21:44.500 --> 21:46.440\n but, you know, as I got older,\n\n21:48.340 --> 21:51.340\n I realized that that's a kind of compliment\n\n21:51.340 --> 21:55.680\n because in the same kind of, I would say,\n\n21:56.740 --> 21:59.860\n way that you're saying that is the American ideal,\n\n21:59.860 --> 22:02.760\n because if you want to do anything special or interesting,\n\n22:02.760 --> 22:06.340\n you don't want to be doing in one particular avenue\n\n22:06.340 --> 22:11.340\n what normal people do, because that won't be interesting.\n\n22:12.380 --> 22:14.860\n Russians, I think fit in very well here\n\n22:14.860 --> 22:16.780\n because the ones who come are weirdos.\n\n22:16.780 --> 22:19.100\n And there's a very different Russian weirdo tradition\n\n22:19.100 --> 22:20.340\n like Alyosha, right?\n\n22:20.340 --> 22:21.940\n And by this card, I miss off.\n\n22:21.940 --> 22:25.060\n Or Perelman, the mathematician, they're weirdos.\n\n22:25.060 --> 22:27.860\n And they have their own different kind of status\n\n22:27.860 --> 22:30.740\n in Soviet Union, Russia, wherever.\n\n22:30.740 --> 22:32.380\n And when Russians come to America,\n\n22:32.380 --> 22:35.180\n they stay pretty Russian, but it seems to me a week later,\n\n22:35.180 --> 22:38.020\n they've somehow adjusted.\n\n22:38.020 --> 22:40.860\n And the ways in which they might want to be like grumpier\n\n22:40.860 --> 22:42.260\n than Americans, not smile,\n\n22:42.260 --> 22:44.200\n think that people who smile are idiots,\n\n22:44.200 --> 22:45.220\n like they can do that.\n\n22:45.220 --> 22:46.980\n No one takes that away from them.\n\n22:48.300 --> 22:50.700\n What are you, on a tiny tangent,\n\n22:50.700 --> 22:52.220\n I'd love to hear if you have thoughts\n\n22:52.220 --> 22:57.060\n about Grisha Perelman turning down the Fields Medal.\n\n22:57.060 --> 22:59.180\n Is that something you admire?\n\n22:59.180 --> 23:02.100\n Does that make sense to you that somebody,\n\n23:02.100 --> 23:04.160\n you know, with the structure of Nobel Prizes,\n\n23:04.160 --> 23:06.340\n of these huge awards, of the reputations,\n\n23:06.340 --> 23:09.240\n the hierarchy of everyone saying, applauding,\n\n23:09.240 --> 23:12.060\n how special you are, and here's a person\n\n23:12.060 --> 23:14.820\n who was doing one of the greatest accomplishments\n\n23:14.820 --> 23:16.160\n in the history of mathematics.\n\n23:16.160 --> 23:17.660\n It doesn't want the stupid prize\n\n23:17.660 --> 23:19.380\n and doesn't want recognition,\n\n23:19.380 --> 23:20.580\n doesn't want to do interviews,\n\n23:20.580 --> 23:22.020\n it doesn't want to be famous.\n\n23:22.020 --> 23:24.140\n What do you make of that?\n\n23:24.140 --> 23:24.980\n It's great.\n\n23:24.980 --> 23:26.880\n Look, prizes are corrupting.\n\n23:26.880 --> 23:28.940\n After scientists win Nobel Prizes,\n\n23:28.940 --> 23:31.220\n they tend to become less productive.\n\n23:31.220 --> 23:32.960\n Now, statistically, it's hard to sort out\n\n23:32.960 --> 23:33.800\n the different effects.\n\n23:33.800 --> 23:35.340\n There's aggression toward the mean.\n\n23:35.340 --> 23:36.660\n Does the prize make you too busy?\n\n23:36.660 --> 23:38.060\n It's a little tricky, but.\n\n23:38.060 --> 23:39.900\n There's not enough Nobel Prizes either\n\n23:39.900 --> 23:41.780\n to gather enough data.\n\n23:41.780 --> 23:45.260\n Right, but I've known a lot of Nobel Prize winners,\n\n23:45.260 --> 23:47.780\n and it is my sense they become less productive.\n\n23:47.780 --> 23:49.580\n They repeat more of their older messages,\n\n23:49.580 --> 23:52.220\n which may be highly socially valuable,\n\n23:52.220 --> 23:54.960\n but if someone wants to turn their back on that\n\n23:54.960 --> 23:58.300\n and keep on working, which I assume is what he's doing,\n\n23:58.300 --> 23:59.400\n that's awesome.\n\n23:59.400 --> 24:01.300\n I mean, we should respect that.\n\n24:01.300 --> 24:02.980\n It's like he wins a bigger prize, right?\n\n24:02.980 --> 24:04.460\n Our extreme respect.\n\n24:04.460 --> 24:05.280\n Yeah.\n\n24:06.560 --> 24:07.820\n Wow.\n\n24:07.820 --> 24:10.700\n Grisha, if you're listening, I need to talk to you soon.\n\n24:10.700 --> 24:11.540\n Okay.\n\n24:11.540 --> 24:15.140\n I've been trying to get ahold of him.\n\n24:15.140 --> 24:15.960\n Okay.\n\n24:17.580 --> 24:18.460\n Back to capitalism.\n\n24:18.460 --> 24:20.720\n I gotta ask you, just competition in general,\n\n24:20.720 --> 24:22.560\n in this world of weirdos,\n\n24:22.560 --> 24:24.820\n is competition good for the world?\n\n24:24.820 --> 24:29.820\n This kind of seems to be one of the fundamental engines\n\n24:29.940 --> 24:31.100\n of capitalism, right?\n\n24:31.100 --> 24:32.860\n Do you see it as ultimately constructive\n\n24:32.860 --> 24:34.860\n or destructive for the world?\n\n24:34.860 --> 24:37.660\n What really matters is how good your legal framework is.\n\n24:37.660 --> 24:40.820\n So competition within nature for food\n\n24:40.820 --> 24:42.500\n leads to bloody conflict all the time.\n\n24:42.500 --> 24:46.300\n The animal world is quite unpleasant, to say the least.\n\n24:46.300 --> 24:49.860\n If you have something like the rule of law\n\n24:49.860 --> 24:52.060\n and clearly defined property rights,\n\n24:52.060 --> 24:54.780\n which are within reason justly allocated,\n\n24:56.100 --> 24:58.960\n competition probably is gonna work very well.\n\n24:58.960 --> 25:01.460\n But it's not an unalloyed good thing at all.\n\n25:01.460 --> 25:02.900\n It can be highly destructive.\n\n25:02.900 --> 25:05.300\n Military competition, right?\n\n25:05.300 --> 25:07.820\n Which actually is itself sometimes good,\n\n25:07.820 --> 25:09.380\n but it's not good per se.\n\n25:09.380 --> 25:11.340\n What aspects of life do you think\n\n25:11.340 --> 25:13.820\n we should protect from competition?\n\n25:13.820 --> 25:16.620\n Is there some, you said like the rule of law,\n\n25:16.620 --> 25:19.780\n is there some things we should keep away from competition?\n\n25:19.780 --> 25:22.180\n Well, the fight for territory, most of all, right?\n\n25:22.180 --> 25:24.220\n So violence, anything that involves\n\n25:24.220 --> 25:25.780\n like actual physical violence.\n\n25:25.780 --> 25:26.860\n Right, and it's not that I think\n\n25:26.860 --> 25:28.140\n the current borders are just.\n\n25:28.140 --> 25:31.860\n I mean, go talk to Hungarians, Romanians,\n\n25:31.860 --> 25:34.500\n Serbians, Bosnians, they'll talk your ear off.\n\n25:34.500 --> 25:36.720\n And some of them are probably right.\n\n25:36.720 --> 25:37.660\n But at the end of the day,\n\n25:37.660 --> 25:40.620\n we have some kind of international order.\n\n25:40.620 --> 25:43.200\n And I would rather we more or less stick with it.\n\n25:44.380 --> 25:46.860\n If Catalonians wanna leave, they keep up with it,\n\n25:46.860 --> 25:48.420\n let them go, but.\n\n25:48.420 --> 25:50.500\n What about a space of like healthcare?\n\n25:50.500 --> 25:52.660\n This is where you get into a tension of like\n\n25:52.660 --> 25:55.500\n between capitalism and kind of more,\n\n25:56.500 --> 25:57.900\n I don't wanna use socialism,\n\n25:57.900 --> 26:02.620\n but those kinds of policies that are less free market.\n\n26:02.620 --> 26:03.460\n I think in this country,\n\n26:03.460 --> 26:06.020\n healthcare should be much more competitive.\n\n26:06.020 --> 26:07.580\n So you go to hospitals, doctors,\n\n26:07.580 --> 26:10.020\n they don't treat you like a customer.\n\n26:10.020 --> 26:11.980\n They treat you like an idiot or like a child\n\n26:11.980 --> 26:14.520\n or someone with third party payment.\n\n26:14.520 --> 26:18.840\n And it's a pretty humiliating experience often.\n\n26:18.840 --> 26:19.680\n Yeah.\n\n26:19.680 --> 26:22.860\n Do you think a free market in general is possible?\n\n26:22.860 --> 26:25.160\n Like a pure free market?\n\n26:25.160 --> 26:28.260\n And is that a good goal to strive for?\n\n26:28.260 --> 26:31.300\n I don't think the term pure free market's well defined\n\n26:31.300 --> 26:33.020\n because you need a legal order.\n\n26:33.020 --> 26:35.100\n Legal order has to make decisions\n\n26:35.100 --> 26:37.020\n on like what is intellectual property\n\n26:37.020 --> 26:38.520\n more important than ever.\n\n26:38.520 --> 26:40.500\n There's no benchmark that like represents\n\n26:40.500 --> 26:43.800\n the pure free market way of doing things.\n\n26:43.800 --> 26:45.460\n What will penalties be?\n\n26:45.460 --> 26:47.840\n How much do we put into law enforcement?\n\n26:47.840 --> 26:50.780\n No simple answers, but just saying free market\n\n26:50.780 --> 26:52.380\n doesn't pin down what you're gonna do\n\n26:52.380 --> 26:53.980\n on those all important questions.\n\n26:53.980 --> 26:56.980\n So free market is an economics, I guess, idea.\n\n26:56.980 --> 27:01.220\n So it's not possible for free market to generate the rules\n\n27:01.220 --> 27:03.780\n that are like emergent, like self governing?\n\n27:03.780 --> 27:05.320\n It generates a lot of them, right?\n\n27:05.320 --> 27:08.140\n Through private norms, through trade associations.\n\n27:08.140 --> 27:13.140\n International trade is mostly done privately and by norms.\n\n27:13.140 --> 27:16.020\n So it's certainly possible, but at the end of the day,\n\n27:16.020 --> 27:19.940\n I think you need governments to draw very clear lines\n\n27:19.940 --> 27:24.180\n to prevent it from turning into mafia run systems.\n\n27:24.180 --> 27:29.180\n You know, I've been hanging out with other group of weirdos,\n\n27:29.340 --> 27:34.340\n lately Michael Malice, who espouses to be an anarchist,\n\n27:34.760 --> 27:39.440\n anarchism, which is like, I think intellectually\n\n27:39.440 --> 27:44.440\n just a fascinating set of ideas, where taking free market\n\n27:46.300 --> 27:48.580\n to the full extreme of basically saying\n\n27:48.580 --> 27:53.580\n there should be no government, what is it?\n\n27:54.260 --> 27:57.740\n Oversight, I guess, and then everything should be fully,\n\n27:57.740 --> 28:00.340\n like all the agreements, all the collectives you form\n\n28:00.340 --> 28:05.340\n should be voluntary, not based on the geographic land\n\n28:05.660 --> 28:07.460\n you were born on and so on.\n\n28:07.460 --> 28:10.900\n Do you think that's just a giant mess?\n\n28:10.900 --> 28:13.620\n Like, do you think it's possible for an anarchist society\n\n28:13.620 --> 28:18.620\n to work where it's, you know, in a fully distributed way,\n\n28:18.940 --> 28:20.500\n people agree with each other,\n\n28:20.500 --> 28:22.700\n not just on financial transactions,\n\n28:22.700 --> 28:27.700\n but you know, on their personal security,\n\n28:28.060 --> 28:31.940\n on sort of military type of stuff, on healthcare,\n\n28:31.940 --> 28:34.100\n on education, all those kinds of things.\n\n28:34.100 --> 28:35.700\n And where does it break down?\n\n28:35.700 --> 28:37.660\n Well, I wouldn't press a button to say get rid\n\n28:37.660 --> 28:40.540\n of our current constitution, which I view is pretty good\n\n28:40.540 --> 28:43.060\n and quite wise, but I think the deeper point\n\n28:43.060 --> 28:47.220\n is that all societies are in some regards anarchistic\n\n28:47.220 --> 28:49.100\n and we should take the anarchists seriously.\n\n28:49.100 --> 28:53.580\n So globally, there's a kind of anarchy across borders,\n\n28:53.580 --> 28:57.260\n even within federalistic systems, they're typically complex.\n\n28:57.260 --> 29:00.340\n There's not a clear transitivity necessarily\n\n29:00.340 --> 29:03.140\n of who has the final say over what,\n\n29:03.140 --> 29:05.300\n just the state vis a vis its people.\n\n29:05.300 --> 29:09.060\n There's not per se a final arbitrator in that regard.\n\n29:09.060 --> 29:13.060\n So you want a good anarchy rather than a bad anarchy.\n\n29:13.060 --> 29:15.980\n You wanna squish your anarchy into the right corners.\n\n29:15.980 --> 29:18.420\n And I don't think there's a theoretical answer\n\n29:18.420 --> 29:20.660\n how to do it, but you start with a country,\n\n29:20.660 --> 29:23.540\n like is it working well enough now?\n\n29:23.540 --> 29:25.740\n This country, you'd say mostly,\n\n29:25.740 --> 29:28.220\n you'd certainly wanna make a lot of improvements.\n\n29:28.220 --> 29:29.700\n And that's why I don't wanna press that\n\n29:29.700 --> 29:31.660\n get rid of the constitution button,\n\n29:31.660 --> 29:34.060\n but to just dump on the anarchists is to miss the point.\n\n29:34.060 --> 29:36.540\n Always try to learn from any opinion.\n\n29:37.500 --> 29:39.100\n What in it is true?\n\n29:39.100 --> 29:42.900\n I'm just like marveling at the poetry\n\n29:42.900 --> 29:45.580\n of saying that we should squish our anarchy\n\n29:45.580 --> 29:48.380\n into the right corners of it.\n\n29:48.380 --> 29:52.020\n Okay, I gotta ask, I've been talking with,\n\n29:53.940 --> 29:55.940\n since we're doing a whirlwind introduction\n\n29:55.940 --> 29:57.420\n to all of economics,\n\n29:57.420 --> 30:00.100\n I've been talking to a few objectivists recently\n\n30:00.100 --> 30:04.340\n and just, Ayn Rand comes up as a person,\n\n30:04.340 --> 30:07.060\n as a philosopher throughout many conversations.\n\n30:07.060 --> 30:09.180\n A lot of people really despise her.\n\n30:09.180 --> 30:11.140\n A lot of people really love her.\n\n30:11.140 --> 30:14.940\n It's always weird to me when somebody arouses a philosophy\n\n30:14.940 --> 30:16.780\n or a human being arouses that much emotion\n\n30:16.780 --> 30:20.140\n in either direction, does she make,\n\n30:20.140 --> 30:22.780\n do you understand, first of all, that level of emotion\n\n30:22.780 --> 30:25.060\n and what are your thoughts about Ayn Rand\n\n30:25.060 --> 30:26.700\n and her philosophy of objectivism?\n\n30:26.700 --> 30:31.140\n Is it useful at all to think about this kind of formulation\n\n30:31.140 --> 30:34.860\n of a rational self interest,\n\n30:34.860 --> 30:36.700\n if I could put it in those words,\n\n30:36.700 --> 30:41.700\n or I guess more negatively the selfishness\n\n30:43.100 --> 30:46.540\n or she would put, I guess, the virtue of selfishness.\n\n30:46.540 --> 30:49.300\n Ayn Rand was a big influence on me growing up.\n\n30:49.300 --> 30:50.860\n The book that really mattered for me was\n\n30:50.860 --> 30:53.340\n Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal.\n\n30:53.340 --> 30:56.220\n The notion that wealth creates opportunity\n\n30:56.220 --> 30:59.860\n and good lives and wealth is something we ought to valorize\n\n30:59.860 --> 31:01.340\n and give very high status.\n\n31:01.340 --> 31:02.860\n It's one of her key ideas.\n\n31:02.860 --> 31:04.500\n I think it's completely correct.\n\n31:04.500 --> 31:06.100\n I think she has the most profound\n\n31:06.100 --> 31:08.780\n and articulate statement of that idea.\n\n31:08.780 --> 31:10.780\n That said, as a philosopher,\n\n31:10.780 --> 31:12.980\n I disagree with her on most things.\n\n31:12.980 --> 31:15.700\n And I did, even like as a boy, when I was reading her,\n\n31:15.700 --> 31:17.820\n I read Plato before Ayn Rand.\n\n31:17.820 --> 31:19.140\n And in a Socratic dialogue,\n\n31:19.140 --> 31:20.380\n there's all these different points of view\n\n31:20.380 --> 31:22.100\n being thrown around.\n\n31:22.100 --> 31:24.100\n And whomever it is you agree with,\n\n31:24.100 --> 31:27.020\n you understand the wisdom is in the coming together\n\n31:27.020 --> 31:28.700\n of the different points of view.\n\n31:28.700 --> 31:29.780\n And she doesn't have that.\n\n31:29.780 --> 31:32.980\n So altruism can be wonderful in my view.\n\n31:32.980 --> 31:35.340\n Humans are not actually that rational.\n\n31:35.340 --> 31:38.140\n Self interest is often poorly defined.\n\n31:38.140 --> 31:41.140\n To pound the table and say existence exists.\n\n31:41.140 --> 31:42.900\n I wouldn't say I disagree,\n\n31:42.900 --> 31:46.460\n but I'm not sure that it's a very meaningful statement.\n\n31:46.460 --> 31:49.220\n I think the secret to Ayn Rand is that she was Russian.\n\n31:49.220 --> 31:52.020\n I'd love to have her on my podcast if she was still alive.\n\n31:52.020 --> 31:53.820\n I'd only ask her about Russia,\n\n31:53.820 --> 31:56.060\n which she mostly never talked about\n\n31:56.060 --> 31:57.860\n after writing We the Living.\n\n31:57.860 --> 32:01.580\n And she is much more Russian than she seems at first,\n\n32:01.580 --> 32:04.340\n even like purging people from the objectivist circles.\n\n32:04.340 --> 32:07.380\n It's like how Russians, especially female Russians,\n\n32:07.380 --> 32:09.300\n so often purge their friends.\n\n32:09.300 --> 32:11.540\n It's weird, all the parallels.\n\n32:11.540 --> 32:13.460\n So you're saying, so yes,\n\n32:13.460 --> 32:17.740\n so assuming she's still not around,\n\n32:17.740 --> 32:20.580\n but if she is and she comes onto your podcast,\n\n32:20.580 --> 32:21.940\n can you dig into that a little bit?\n\n32:21.940 --> 32:26.020\n Do you mean like her personal demons\n\n32:26.020 --> 32:31.020\n around the social and economic Russia of the time,\n\n32:31.940 --> 32:32.860\n when she escaped?\n\n32:32.860 --> 32:34.820\n The traumas she suffered there,\n\n32:34.820 --> 32:37.540\n what she really likes in the music and literature and why.\n\n32:37.540 --> 32:38.580\n Music and literature, huh?\n\n32:38.580 --> 32:40.220\n And getting deeply into that,\n\n32:40.220 --> 32:42.860\n her view of relations between the sexes and Russia,\n\n32:42.860 --> 32:44.980\n how it differs from America,\n\n32:44.980 --> 32:48.260\n why she still carries through the old Russian vision\n\n32:48.260 --> 32:51.500\n in her fiction, this extreme sexual dimorphism,\n\n32:51.500 --> 32:53.860\n but with also very strong women,\n\n32:53.860 --> 32:57.860\n to me is a uniquely, at least Eastern European vision,\n\n32:57.860 --> 32:59.380\n mostly Russian, I would say.\n\n33:00.380 --> 33:03.140\n And that's in her, that's her actual real philosophy,\n\n33:03.140 --> 33:06.060\n not this table bounding existence exists.\n\n33:06.060 --> 33:07.820\n And that's not talked about enough.\n\n33:07.820 --> 33:09.260\n She's a Russian philosopher.\n\n33:09.260 --> 33:12.380\n Or Soviet, whatever you wanna call it.\n\n33:12.380 --> 33:14.700\n And if she wasn't so certain,\n\n33:14.700 --> 33:17.340\n she could have been a Dostoevsky where it's not,\n\n33:17.340 --> 33:19.060\n that certainty is almost the thing\n\n33:19.060 --> 33:23.340\n that brings out the adoration of millions,\n\n33:23.340 --> 33:25.260\n but also the hatred of millions.\n\n33:25.260 --> 33:29.020\n She became a cult figure in a somewhat Russian like manner.\n\n33:29.020 --> 33:29.980\n Yeah.\n\n33:29.980 --> 33:30.820\n Yeah.\n\n33:30.820 --> 33:32.140\n It is what it is.\n\n33:32.140 --> 33:34.580\n But I love the idea that, again,\n\n33:34.580 --> 33:37.100\n you're just dropping bombs that are poetic,\n\n33:37.100 --> 33:40.940\n that the wisdom is in the coming together of ideas.\n\n33:40.940 --> 33:42.300\n It's kind of interesting to think\n\n33:42.300 --> 33:46.780\n that no one human possesses wisdom.\n\n33:46.780 --> 33:49.380\n No one idea is the wisdom.\n\n33:49.380 --> 33:52.180\n That the coming together is the wisdom.\n\n33:52.180 --> 33:54.620\n Like in my view, Boswell's Life of Johnson,\n\n33:54.620 --> 33:56.900\n 18th century British biography.\n\n33:56.900 --> 33:59.900\n It's in essence a coauthored work, Boswell and Johnson.\n\n33:59.900 --> 34:02.660\n It's one of the greatest philosophy books ever,\n\n34:02.660 --> 34:05.180\n though it is commonly regarded as a biography.\n\n34:05.180 --> 34:07.180\n John Stuart Mill, who in a sense\n\n34:07.180 --> 34:09.140\n was coauthoring with Harriet Taylor,\n\n34:10.140 --> 34:12.060\n better philosopher than is realized,\n\n34:12.060 --> 34:14.140\n though he's rated very, very highly.\n\n34:14.140 --> 34:18.020\n Plato slash Socrates, a lot of the greatest works\n\n34:18.020 --> 34:19.860\n are in a kind of dialogue form.\n\n34:19.860 --> 34:23.060\n Curtis Faust would be another example.\n\n34:23.060 --> 34:24.940\n It's very much a dialogue.\n\n34:24.940 --> 34:27.340\n And yes, it's drama, but it's also a philosophy.\n\n34:27.340 --> 34:30.380\n Shakespeare, maybe the wisest thinker of them all.\n\n34:31.900 --> 34:35.380\n In your book, Big Business, speaking of Ayn Rand,\n\n34:35.380 --> 34:38.860\n Big Business, A Love Letter to an American Antihero,\n\n34:38.860 --> 34:41.460\n you make the case for the benefit\n\n34:41.460 --> 34:43.500\n that large businesses bring to society.\n\n34:43.500 --> 34:45.140\n Can you explain?\n\n34:45.140 --> 34:46.900\n If you look at, say, the pandemic,\n\n34:46.900 --> 34:49.060\n which has been a catastrophic event, right,\n\n34:49.060 --> 34:52.620\n for many reasons, but who is it that saved us?\n\n34:52.620 --> 34:56.180\n So Amazon has done remarkably well.\n\n34:56.180 --> 34:59.420\n They upped their delivery game more or less overnight\n\n34:59.420 --> 35:00.980\n with very few hitches.\n\n35:00.980 --> 35:03.660\n I've ordered hundreds of Amazon packages,\n\n35:03.660 --> 35:07.380\n direct delivery food, whether it's DoorDash or Uber Eats,\n\n35:07.380 --> 35:10.100\n or using Whole Foods through Amazon shipping.\n\n35:10.100 --> 35:12.260\n Again, it's gone remarkably well.\n\n35:12.260 --> 35:15.780\n Switching over our entire higher educational system,\n\n35:15.780 --> 35:18.140\n basically within two weeks, to Zoom.\n\n35:18.140 --> 35:19.100\n Zoom did it.\n\n35:19.100 --> 35:21.260\n I mean, I've had a Zoom outage,\n\n35:21.260 --> 35:24.820\n but their performance rate has been remarkably high.\n\n35:24.820 --> 35:29.420\n So if you just look at resources, competence, incentives,\n\n35:29.420 --> 35:31.900\n who's been the star performers, the NBA even,\n\n35:31.900 --> 35:34.460\n just canceling the season as early as they did,\n\n35:34.460 --> 35:37.580\n sending a message like, hey, people, this is real,\n\n35:37.580 --> 35:39.580\n and then pulling off the bubble\n\n35:39.580 --> 35:41.700\n with not a single found case of COVID\n\n35:41.700 --> 35:45.060\n and having all the testing set up in advance.\n\n35:45.060 --> 35:47.820\n Big business has done very well lately,\n\n35:47.820 --> 35:50.700\n and throughout the broader course of American history,\n\n35:50.700 --> 35:52.700\n in my view, has mostly been a hero.\n\n35:53.900 --> 35:56.220\n Can we engage in a kind of therapy session?\n\n35:58.540 --> 36:03.540\n I'm often troubled by the negativity towards big business,\n\n36:04.180 --> 36:07.260\n and I wonder if you could help figure out\n\n36:07.260 --> 36:11.380\n how we remove that or maybe first psychoanalyze it\n\n36:11.380 --> 36:12.980\n and then how we remove it.\n\n36:12.980 --> 36:17.980\n It feels like once we've gotten wifi on flights,\n\n36:20.620 --> 36:24.860\n on airplane flights, people started complaining\n\n36:24.860 --> 36:27.180\n about how shady the connection is, right?\n\n36:27.180 --> 36:29.540\n They take it for granted immediately\n\n36:29.540 --> 36:31.900\n and then start complaining about little details.\n\n36:31.900 --> 36:36.380\n Another example that's closer to,\n\n36:36.380 --> 36:39.740\n especially as an aspiring entrepreneur,\n\n36:39.740 --> 36:41.980\n is closer to the things I'm thinking about\n\n36:41.980 --> 36:44.060\n is Jack Dorsey with Twitter.\n\n36:45.260 --> 36:46.940\n To me, Twitter has enabled\n\n36:46.940 --> 36:50.620\n an incredible platform of communication,\n\n36:50.620 --> 36:53.420\n and yet the biggest thing that people talk about\n\n36:53.420 --> 36:57.380\n is not how incredible this platform is.\n\n36:58.460 --> 37:00.660\n They essentially use the platform\n\n37:00.660 --> 37:03.700\n to complain about the censorship of a few individuals\n\n37:04.620 --> 37:06.260\n as opposed to how amazing it is.\n\n37:06.260 --> 37:09.420\n Now, you should talk about how shady the wifi is\n\n37:09.420 --> 37:12.460\n and how censorship or the removal of Donald Trump\n\n37:12.460 --> 37:13.820\n from the platform is a bad thing,\n\n37:13.820 --> 37:17.740\n but it feels like we don't talk about the positive impacts\n\n37:17.740 --> 37:20.420\n at scale of these technologies.\n\n37:20.420 --> 37:23.940\n Can you explain why and is there a way to fix it?\n\n37:23.940 --> 37:25.340\n I don't know if we can fix it.\n\n37:25.340 --> 37:29.300\n I think we are beings of high neuroticism for the most part\n\n37:29.300 --> 37:30.740\n as a personality trait.\n\n37:30.740 --> 37:33.460\n Not everyone, but most people.\n\n37:33.460 --> 37:34.780\n And as a compliment to that,\n\n37:34.780 --> 37:38.140\n if someone says 10 nice things about you and one insult,\n\n37:38.140 --> 37:39.540\n you're more bothered by the insult\n\n37:39.540 --> 37:41.140\n than you're pleased by the nice things,\n\n37:41.140 --> 37:43.820\n especially if the insult is somewhat true.\n\n37:43.820 --> 37:46.620\n So you have these media, these vehicles,\n\n37:46.620 --> 37:48.420\n Twitter is one you mentioned,\n\n37:48.420 --> 37:50.580\n where there's all kinds of messages going back and forth,\n\n37:50.580 --> 37:53.580\n and you're really bugged by the messages you don't like.\n\n37:53.580 --> 37:56.180\n Most people are neurotic to begin with.\n\n37:56.180 --> 37:58.820\n It's not only taken out on big business, to be clear.\n\n37:58.820 --> 38:01.580\n So Congress catches a lot of grief\n\n38:01.580 --> 38:03.940\n and some of it they deserve, yes.\n\n38:05.260 --> 38:07.380\n Religion is not attacked the same way,\n\n38:07.380 --> 38:09.820\n but religiosity is declining.\n\n38:09.820 --> 38:14.580\n If you poll people, the military still polls quite well,\n\n38:14.580 --> 38:17.020\n but people are very disillusioned with many things.\n\n38:17.020 --> 38:19.740\n And the Martin Gury thesis that because of the internet,\n\n38:19.740 --> 38:21.580\n you just see more of things.\n\n38:21.580 --> 38:22.860\n And the more you see of something,\n\n38:22.860 --> 38:24.940\n whether it's good, bad, or in between,\n\n38:24.940 --> 38:26.740\n the more you will find to complain about,\n\n38:26.740 --> 38:28.940\n I suspect is the fundamental mechanism here.\n\n38:30.460 --> 38:32.660\n I mean, look at Clubhouse, right?\n\n38:32.660 --> 38:35.780\n To me, it's a great service, may or may not be like my thing,\n\n38:35.780 --> 38:37.380\n but gives people this opportunity.\n\n38:37.380 --> 38:39.100\n No one makes you go on it.\n\n38:39.100 --> 38:40.620\n And all these media articles like,\n\n38:40.620 --> 38:42.740\n oh, is Clubhouse gonna wreck things?\n\n38:42.740 --> 38:44.260\n Are they gonna break things?\n\n38:44.260 --> 38:45.740\n New York Times is complaining.\n\n38:45.740 --> 38:48.020\n Of course, it's their competitor as well.\n\n38:48.020 --> 38:50.820\n I'm like, give these people a chance, talk it up.\n\n38:50.820 --> 38:52.700\n You may or may not like it.\n\n38:52.700 --> 38:55.580\n Let's praise the people who are getting something done.\n\n38:55.580 --> 38:57.780\n Very Ayn Randian point.\n\n38:57.780 --> 39:01.460\n As an economic thinker, as a writer, as a podcaster,\n\n39:01.460 --> 39:03.980\n what do you think about Clubhouse?\n\n39:03.980 --> 39:06.300\n What do you think about...\n\n39:06.300 --> 39:09.780\n Okay, let me just throw my feeling about it.\n\n39:09.780 --> 39:12.380\n I used to use Discord, which is another service\n\n39:12.380 --> 39:13.620\n where people use voice.\n\n39:13.620 --> 39:16.420\n So the only thing you do is just hear each other.\n\n39:16.420 --> 39:19.060\n There's no face, you just see a little icon.\n\n39:19.060 --> 39:23.700\n That's the essential element of Clubhouse.\n\n39:23.700 --> 39:26.540\n And there's an intimacy to voice only communication.\n\n39:26.540 --> 39:27.660\n That's hard.\n\n39:27.660 --> 39:30.860\n That didn't make sense to me, but it was just what it is,\n\n39:30.860 --> 39:33.420\n which feels like something that won't last\n\n39:33.420 --> 39:36.260\n for some reason, maybe it's the cynical view.\n\n39:36.260 --> 39:40.900\n But what's your sense about the intimacy\n\n39:40.900 --> 39:43.420\n of what's happening right now with Clubhouse?\n\n39:43.420 --> 39:45.580\n I've greatly enjoyed what I've done,\n\n39:45.580 --> 39:47.380\n but I'm not sure it's for me in the long run\n\n39:47.380 --> 39:48.740\n for two reasons.\n\n39:48.740 --> 39:52.500\n First, if you compare it to doing a podcast,\n\n39:52.500 --> 39:55.220\n podcasting has greater reach than Clubhouse.\n\n39:55.220 --> 39:58.340\n So I would rather put time into my podcast.\n\n39:58.340 --> 40:02.820\n But then also my core asset, so to speak,\n\n40:02.820 --> 40:04.980\n is I'm a very fast reader.\n\n40:04.980 --> 40:08.220\n So audio per se is not necessarily to my advantage.\n\n40:08.220 --> 40:10.860\n I don't speak or listen faster than other people.\n\n40:10.860 --> 40:13.620\n In fact, I'm a slower listener because I like 1.0,\n\n40:13.620 --> 40:15.500\n not 1.5X.\n\n40:15.500 --> 40:17.260\n So I should spend less time on audio\n\n40:17.260 --> 40:18.820\n and more time reading and writing.\n\n40:18.820 --> 40:21.860\n Yeah, it's interesting because you mentioned podcasts\n\n40:21.860 --> 40:26.860\n and audio books, the podcasts are recorded\n\n40:28.660 --> 40:32.100\n and so I can skip things, like I can skip commercials,\n\n40:32.100 --> 40:34.060\n or I can skip parts where it's like,\n\n40:34.060 --> 40:36.220\n ugh, this part is boring.\n\n40:36.220 --> 40:40.140\n With live conversations, especially when,\n\n40:40.140 --> 40:42.540\n there's a magic to the fact when you have a lot of people\n\n40:42.540 --> 40:44.820\n participating in that conversation,\n\n40:44.820 --> 40:47.980\n but some people are like, ugh, this topic,\n\n40:47.980 --> 40:50.100\n they're going into this thing and you can't skip it\n\n40:50.100 --> 40:53.980\n or you can't fast forward, you can go 1.5X or 2X,\n\n40:53.980 --> 40:55.140\n you can't speed it up.\n\n40:56.100 --> 40:58.540\n Nevertheless, there's a tension between that,\n\n40:58.540 --> 41:00.540\n so that's the productivity aspect,\n\n41:00.540 --> 41:04.620\n with the actual magic of live communication,\n\n41:04.620 --> 41:07.420\n where anything can happen, where Elon Musk\n\n41:07.420 --> 41:11.340\n can ask the CEO of Robinhood, Vlad, about like,\n\n41:11.340 --> 41:13.300\n hey, somebody holding a gun to your head,\n\n41:13.300 --> 41:16.100\n there's something shady going on, the magic of that.\n\n41:16.100 --> 41:18.300\n That's also my criticism of like,\n\n41:18.300 --> 41:20.900\n there's been a recent conversation with Bill Gates\n\n41:20.900 --> 41:25.900\n that he won a platform and had a regular interview\n\n41:26.700 --> 41:29.540\n on the platform without allowing the possibility\n\n41:29.540 --> 41:31.380\n of the magic of the chaos.\n\n41:32.460 --> 41:36.180\n So I'm not exactly sure, it's probably not the right\n\n41:36.180 --> 41:38.380\n platform for you and for many other people\n\n41:38.380 --> 41:40.860\n who are exceptionally productive in other places,\n\n41:40.860 --> 41:43.420\n but there's still nevertheless a magic to the chaos\n\n41:43.420 --> 41:45.540\n that can be created with live conversation\n\n41:45.540 --> 41:47.860\n that gives me pause.\n\n41:47.860 --> 41:50.140\n Maybe what it's perfect for is the tribute.\n\n41:50.140 --> 41:52.520\n So they had an episode recently that I didn't hear,\n\n41:52.520 --> 41:54.040\n but I heard it was wonderful.\n\n41:54.040 --> 41:56.380\n It was anecdotes about Steve Jobs.\n\n41:56.380 --> 41:58.040\n That you can't do one to one, right?\n\n41:58.040 --> 41:59.460\n And you don't want control.\n\n41:59.460 --> 42:02.020\n You want different people appearing and stepping up\n\n42:02.020 --> 42:03.780\n and saying their bit.\n\n42:03.780 --> 42:07.740\n And Clubhouse is 110% perfect for that.\n\n42:07.740 --> 42:08.900\n The tribute.\n\n42:08.900 --> 42:10.500\n I love that, the tribute.\n\n42:10.500 --> 42:12.580\n But there's also the possibility,\n\n42:12.580 --> 42:15.740\n I think there was a time when somebody arranged\n\n42:15.740 --> 42:18.900\n a conversation with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates on stage.\n\n42:18.900 --> 42:21.000\n I remember that happened a long time ago.\n\n42:22.540 --> 42:24.560\n And it was very formal.\n\n42:26.580 --> 42:27.900\n It could have probably gone better,\n\n42:27.900 --> 42:30.060\n but it was still magical to have these people\n\n42:30.060 --> 42:32.220\n that obviously had a bunch of tension\n\n42:32.220 --> 42:33.420\n throughout their history.\n\n42:35.420 --> 42:39.460\n It's so frictionless to have two major figures\n\n42:39.460 --> 42:42.580\n in world history just jump on a Clubhouse stage.\n\n42:42.580 --> 42:43.780\n Putin and Elon Musk.\n\n42:43.780 --> 42:45.660\n Putin and Elon Musk.\n\n42:45.660 --> 42:47.180\n And that's exactly it.\n\n42:47.180 --> 42:48.820\n So there's a language barrier there.\n\n42:48.820 --> 42:52.860\n There's also the problem that in particular,\n\n42:52.860 --> 42:55.900\n it's like Biden would have a similar problem.\n\n42:55.900 --> 42:58.340\n It's like they're just not into a new technology.\n\n42:58.340 --> 43:01.580\n So it's very hard to catch the Kremlin up to,\n\n43:01.580 --> 43:02.860\n first of all, Twitter,\n\n43:03.740 --> 43:05.160\n but to catch them up to Clubhouse,\n\n43:05.160 --> 43:07.260\n you have to have the,\n\n43:07.260 --> 43:08.820\n Elon Musk has a sense of the internet,\n\n43:08.820 --> 43:10.860\n the humor, the memes, and all that kind of stuff\n\n43:10.860 --> 43:14.900\n that you have to have in order to use a new app\n\n43:14.900 --> 43:16.900\n and figure out the timing, the beat,\n\n43:16.900 --> 43:18.280\n what is this thing about?\n\n43:19.140 --> 43:20.540\n So that's the challenge there.\n\n43:20.540 --> 43:21.620\n But that's exactly it.\n\n43:21.620 --> 43:26.620\n That magic of have two big personalities just show up.\n\n43:27.900 --> 43:30.660\n And I wonder if it's just the temporary thing\n\n43:30.660 --> 43:32.340\n that we're going through with the pandemic\n\n43:32.340 --> 43:34.660\n where people are just lonely\n\n43:35.620 --> 43:37.500\n and they're seeking for that human connection\n\n43:37.500 --> 43:40.540\n that we usually get elsewhere through our work.\n\n43:40.540 --> 43:42.620\n But they'll stay lonely, in my opinion.\n\n43:42.620 --> 43:44.560\n You think so? I do.\n\n43:44.560 --> 43:48.140\n So it is a pandemic thing, but I think it will persist.\n\n43:48.140 --> 43:49.900\n And the idea of wanting to be connected\n\n43:49.900 --> 43:53.500\n to more of the world, Clubhouse will still offer that.\n\n43:53.500 --> 43:56.140\n And all the mental health issues out there,\n\n43:56.140 --> 43:58.700\n a lot of people have broken ties\n\n43:58.700 --> 44:00.900\n and they will still be lonely post vaccines.\n\n44:02.300 --> 44:05.600\n Yeah, I, from an artificial intelligence perspective,\n\n44:06.940 --> 44:10.720\n have a sense that there is like a deep loneliness\n\n44:10.720 --> 44:13.140\n in the world, that all of us are really lonely.\n\n44:13.140 --> 44:14.460\n Like we don't even acknowledge it.\n\n44:14.460 --> 44:16.660\n Even people in happy relationships,\n\n44:16.660 --> 44:19.140\n it feels like there's like an iceberg of loneliness\n\n44:19.140 --> 44:22.700\n in all of us, like seeking to be understood,\n\n44:22.700 --> 44:24.980\n like deeply understood, understanding us,\n\n44:24.980 --> 44:27.860\n like having somebody with whom you can have\n\n44:27.860 --> 44:31.540\n a deep interaction enough to where you can,\n\n44:31.540 --> 44:34.100\n they can help you to understand yourself\n\n44:34.100 --> 44:36.460\n and they also understand you.\n\n44:36.460 --> 44:38.820\n Like I have a sense that artificial intelligence systems\n\n44:38.820 --> 44:42.100\n can provide that as well, but humans,\n\n44:42.100 --> 44:44.420\n I think crave that from other humans\n\n44:44.420 --> 44:46.460\n in ways that we perhaps don't acknowledge.\n\n44:46.460 --> 44:48.980\n And I have a hope that technology will enable that\n\n44:48.980 --> 44:50.900\n more and more, like Clubhouse is an example\n\n44:50.900 --> 44:52.260\n that allows that.\n\n44:52.260 --> 44:54.940\n Are touring bots gonna out compete Clubhouse?\n\n44:54.940 --> 44:57.560\n Like why not sort of program your own session?\n\n44:57.560 --> 44:59.900\n You'll just talk into your device\n\n44:59.900 --> 45:02.300\n and say here's the kind of conversation I want\n\n45:02.300 --> 45:04.580\n and it will create the characters for you.\n\n45:04.580 --> 45:07.080\n And it may not be as good as Elon and Vladimir Putin,\n\n45:07.080 --> 45:09.620\n but it will be better than ordinary Clubhouse.\n\n45:09.620 --> 45:11.680\n Yeah, and one of the things that's missing,\n\n45:11.680 --> 45:14.940\n it's not just conversation, it's memory.\n\n45:14.940 --> 45:19.100\n So longterm memories, what current AI systems don't have\n\n45:19.100 --> 45:21.200\n is sharing experience together.\n\n45:21.200 --> 45:24.020\n Forget the words, it's like sharing the highs\n\n45:24.020 --> 45:26.300\n and the lows of life together\n\n45:26.300 --> 45:29.460\n and the systems around us remembering that.\n\n45:29.460 --> 45:31.300\n Remembering we've been through that.\n\n45:31.300 --> 45:32.900\n Like that's the thing that creates\n\n45:32.900 --> 45:35.460\n really close relationships, is going through some shit.\n\n45:35.460 --> 45:37.660\n Like struggle.\n\n45:37.660 --> 45:41.020\n If you survive together, there's something really difficult\n\n45:41.020 --> 45:42.820\n that bonds you with other humans.\n\n45:42.820 --> 45:46.500\n And this is related to immigration and the American dream.\n\n45:46.500 --> 45:47.340\n In what way?\n\n45:47.340 --> 45:48.940\n The people who have come to this country,\n\n45:48.940 --> 45:51.860\n however weird and different they may be,\n\n45:51.860 --> 45:53.740\n they or their ancestors at some point\n\n45:53.740 --> 45:55.300\n probably have shared this thing.\n\n45:58.140 --> 46:00.100\n Right, US is not gonna split up.\n\n46:00.100 --> 46:02.380\n It may get more screwed up as a country,\n\n46:02.380 --> 46:05.500\n but Texas and California are not gonna break off.\n\n46:05.500 --> 46:07.280\n I mean, they're big enough where they could do it,\n\n46:07.280 --> 46:08.920\n but it's just never gonna happen.\n\n46:08.920 --> 46:10.380\n We've been through too much together.\n\n46:10.380 --> 46:11.220\n Yeah.\n\n46:11.220 --> 46:14.060\n Yeah, that's a hopeful message.\n\n46:14.060 --> 46:17.020\n Do you think, some people have talked to Eric Weinstein,\n\n46:17.020 --> 46:18.620\n you've talked to Eric Weinstein.\n\n46:20.060 --> 46:21.700\n He has a sense that growth,\n\n46:23.460 --> 46:26.200\n like the entirety of the American system\n\n46:26.200 --> 46:28.820\n is based on the assumption that we're gonna grow forever,\n\n46:28.820 --> 46:30.980\n that the economy's gonna grow forever.\n\n46:30.980 --> 46:35.780\n Do you think economic growth will continue indefinitely?\n\n46:35.780 --> 46:37.180\n Or will we stagnate?\n\n46:37.180 --> 46:40.940\n I've long been in agreement with Eric, Peter Thiel,\n\n46:40.940 --> 46:45.300\n Robert Gordon and others, that growth has slowed down.\n\n46:45.300 --> 46:46.540\n I argued that in my book,\n\n46:46.540 --> 46:49.620\n The Great Stagnation, appropriately titled.\n\n46:49.620 --> 46:52.180\n But the last two years, I've become much more optimistic.\n\n46:52.180 --> 46:53.900\n I've seen a lot of breakthroughs\n\n46:53.900 --> 46:56.780\n in green energy and battery technology.\n\n46:56.780 --> 47:00.860\n mRNA vaccines and medicine is a big deal already.\n\n47:00.860 --> 47:02.380\n It will repair our GDP\n\n47:02.380 --> 47:05.180\n and save millions of lives around the world.\n\n47:05.180 --> 47:07.100\n There's an anti malaria vaccine\n\n47:07.100 --> 47:10.100\n that's now in stage three trial, it probably works.\n\n47:10.100 --> 47:12.380\n CRISPR to defeat sickle cell anemia.\n\n47:13.660 --> 47:16.540\n Just space, area after area after area,\n\n47:16.540 --> 47:18.780\n there's suddenly the surge of breakthroughs.\n\n47:18.780 --> 47:22.060\n I would say many of them rooted in superior computation\n\n47:22.060 --> 47:23.500\n and ultimately Moore's law\n\n47:23.500 --> 47:26.580\n and access to those computational abilities.\n\n47:26.580 --> 47:28.460\n So I'm much more optimistic than say,\n\n47:28.460 --> 47:30.420\n the last time I spoke to Eric.\n\n47:30.420 --> 47:32.900\n I don't know, he moves all the time in his views.\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:34.220\n I don't know where he's going.\n\n47:34.220 --> 47:35.940\n His views, I don't know where he's at now.\n\n47:35.940 --> 47:38.900\n He's not at, he hasn't gained, that's really interesting.\n\n47:38.900 --> 47:43.900\n So your little drop of optimism comes from like,\n\n47:44.180 --> 47:46.180\n there might be a fundamental shift\n\n47:46.180 --> 47:49.620\n in the kind of things that computation has unlocked for us\n\n47:49.620 --> 47:52.860\n in terms of like, it could be a wellspring of innovation\n\n47:52.860 --> 47:55.540\n that enables growth for a long time to come.\n\n47:55.540 --> 47:59.420\n Like Eric has not quite connected\n\n47:59.420 --> 48:01.620\n to the computation aspect yet\n\n48:01.620 --> 48:04.340\n to where it could be a wellspring of innovation.\n\n48:04.340 --> 48:06.180\n But you're very close to it in your own work.\n\n48:06.180 --> 48:07.740\n I don't have to tell you that.\n\n48:07.740 --> 48:10.020\n The work you're doing would not have been possible\n\n48:10.020 --> 48:11.300\n not very long ago.\n\n48:11.300 --> 48:12.140\n But the question is,\n\n48:12.140 --> 48:14.820\n how much does that work enable continued growth\n\n48:14.820 --> 48:16.180\n for decades to come?\n\n48:16.180 --> 48:17.660\n For all their problems,\n\n48:17.660 --> 48:20.700\n some version of driverless vehicles will be a thing.\n\n48:20.700 --> 48:23.380\n I'm not sure when, you know much better than I do.\n\n48:23.380 --> 48:26.700\n Maybe only partially, but that too will be a big deal.\n\n48:26.700 --> 48:28.220\n Well, one of the open questions\n\n48:28.220 --> 48:32.940\n that sort of the Peter Thiel School area of ideas\n\n48:32.940 --> 48:36.180\n is how much can be converted to technology?\n\n48:36.180 --> 48:38.740\n How much, how many parts of our lives\n\n48:38.740 --> 48:40.740\n can technology integrate and then innovate?\n\n48:40.740 --> 48:43.460\n Like can it replace healthcare?\n\n48:43.460 --> 48:46.420\n Can it replace the legal system?\n\n48:46.420 --> 48:47.740\n Can it replace government?\n\n48:47.740 --> 48:52.740\n Not replace, but like, you know, make it digital\n\n48:52.740 --> 48:57.460\n and thereby enable computation to improve it, right?\n\n48:57.460 --> 48:58.820\n That's the open question,\n\n48:58.820 --> 49:00.740\n because many aspects of our lives\n\n49:00.740 --> 49:04.980\n are still not really that digitized.\n\n49:06.020 --> 49:08.580\n There was a New York Times symposium in April,\n\n49:08.580 --> 49:09.740\n which is not long ago.\n\n49:09.740 --> 49:11.940\n And they asked the so called experts,\n\n49:11.940 --> 49:13.620\n when are we gonna get vaccines?\n\n49:13.620 --> 49:17.700\n And the most optimistic answer was in four years.\n\n49:17.700 --> 49:21.260\n And obviously we beat that by a long mile.\n\n49:21.260 --> 49:23.140\n So I think people still haven't woken up.\n\n49:23.140 --> 49:25.020\n You mentioned my tiny drop of optimism,\n\n49:25.020 --> 49:27.860\n but it's a big drop of optimism.\n\n49:27.860 --> 49:28.940\n Is it a waterfall yet?\n\n49:28.940 --> 49:30.740\n I mean, is it just?\n\n49:30.740 --> 49:32.380\n Well, here's my pessimism.\n\n49:32.380 --> 49:34.460\n Whenever there are major new technologies,\n\n49:34.460 --> 49:36.340\n they also tend to be used for violence\n\n49:36.340 --> 49:39.220\n directly or indirectly, radio, Hitler.\n\n49:39.220 --> 49:41.100\n Not that he hit people over the head with radios,\n\n49:41.100 --> 49:44.700\n but it enabled the rise of various dictators.\n\n49:44.700 --> 49:48.620\n So the new technologies now, whatever exactly they may be,\n\n49:48.620 --> 49:50.500\n they're gonna cause a lot of trouble.\n\n49:50.500 --> 49:51.660\n And that's my pessimism.\n\n49:51.660 --> 49:54.740\n Not that I think they're all gonna slow to a trickle.\n\n49:54.740 --> 49:56.660\n When was the stagnation book?\n\n49:56.660 --> 49:57.860\n 2011.\n\n49:57.860 --> 49:58.740\n 2011.\n\n49:58.740 --> 49:59.900\n Yes.\n\n49:59.900 --> 50:03.060\n It was the first of the stagnation books, in fact.\n\n50:03.060 --> 50:05.220\n It's very interesting.\n\n50:05.220 --> 50:07.700\n But even then I said, this is temporary.\n\n50:07.700 --> 50:09.620\n And I was predicting it would be gone\n\n50:09.620 --> 50:11.220\n in about 20 years time.\n\n50:12.460 --> 50:14.540\n I'm not sure that's exactly the right prediction,\n\n50:14.540 --> 50:17.840\n like 2030, but I think we're actually gonna beat that.\n\n50:19.140 --> 50:21.020\n So you think United States might still be\n\n50:21.020 --> 50:22.980\n on top of the world for the rest of the century\n\n50:22.980 --> 50:26.260\n in terms of its economic growth,\n\n50:26.260 --> 50:28.460\n impact on the world, scientific innovation,\n\n50:28.460 --> 50:29.940\n all those kinds of things?\n\n50:29.940 --> 50:31.460\n That's too long to predict,\n\n50:31.460 --> 50:33.420\n but I'm bullish on America in general.\n\n50:35.060 --> 50:36.740\n Got it.\n\n50:36.740 --> 50:38.900\n Speaking of being bullish on America,\n\n50:38.900 --> 50:40.820\n the opposite of that is,\n\n50:43.420 --> 50:44.420\n we talked about capitalism,\n\n50:44.420 --> 50:47.060\n we talked about Iran and her Russian roots.\n\n50:47.900 --> 50:51.340\n What do you think about communism?\n\n50:51.340 --> 50:53.240\n Why doesn't it work?\n\n50:53.240 --> 50:58.180\n Is it the implementation?\n\n50:58.180 --> 51:01.540\n Is there anything about its ideas that you find compelling?\n\n51:01.540 --> 51:06.220\n Or is it just a fundamentally flawed system?\n\n51:06.220 --> 51:08.020\n Well, communism is like capitalism.\n\n51:08.020 --> 51:10.740\n The words mean many things to different people.\n\n51:10.740 --> 51:12.860\n You could argue my life as a tenured professor\n\n51:12.860 --> 51:15.300\n comes closer to communism than anything\n\n51:15.300 --> 51:16.460\n the human race has seen.\n\n51:16.460 --> 51:19.220\n And I would argue it works pretty well.\n\n51:19.220 --> 51:21.740\n But look, if you mean the Soviet Union,\n\n51:21.740 --> 51:23.700\n it devolved pretty quickly\n\n51:23.700 --> 51:27.500\n to a kind of decentralized set of incentives\n\n51:27.500 --> 51:30.620\n that were destructive rather than value maximizing.\n\n51:30.620 --> 51:34.300\n It wasn't even central planning, much less communism.\n\n51:34.300 --> 51:37.140\n So Paul Craig Roberts and Polanyi were correct\n\n51:37.140 --> 51:39.680\n in their descriptions of the Soviet system.\n\n51:39.680 --> 51:41.580\n Think of it as weird mixes of barter\n\n51:41.580 --> 51:44.100\n and malfunctioning incentives\n\n51:44.100 --> 51:47.100\n and being very good at a whole bunch of things,\n\n51:47.100 --> 51:48.860\n but in terms of progress, innovation,\n\n51:48.860 --> 51:52.240\n and consumer goods, it really being quite a failure.\n\n51:54.460 --> 51:56.380\n And now I wouldn't call that communism,\n\n51:56.380 --> 52:00.420\n but that's what I think of the system the Soviets had.\n\n52:00.420 --> 52:04.840\n And it required an ever increasing pile of lies\n\n52:04.840 --> 52:07.740\n that both alienated people, but created an elite\n\n52:07.740 --> 52:08.940\n that by the end of the thing\n\n52:08.940 --> 52:12.300\n no longer believed in the system itself,\n\n52:12.300 --> 52:15.400\n or even thought they were doing better by being crooks\n\n52:15.400 --> 52:17.000\n than by just say moving to Switzerland\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:18.740\n and being an upper middle class individual,\n\n52:18.740 --> 52:20.740\n like you would have a higher standard of living\n\n52:20.740 --> 52:23.060\n by Gorbachev's time, not Gorbachev,\n\n52:23.060 --> 52:25.340\n but if you're a number 30 in the hierarchy,\n\n52:25.340 --> 52:27.900\n you're better off as a middle class person in Switzerland.\n\n52:27.900 --> 52:31.180\n And that, of course, did not prove sustainable.\n\n52:31.180 --> 52:33.620\n And so it's, what is it, a momentum of bureaucracy\n\n52:33.620 --> 52:34.940\n or something like that, it just builds up\n\n52:34.940 --> 52:37.700\n where you lose control of the original vision,\n\n52:37.700 --> 52:40.180\n and that naturally happens, it's just people.\n\n52:40.180 --> 52:41.980\n And you can't use normal profit and loss\n\n52:41.980 --> 52:44.420\n and price incentives, so you get all prices\n\n52:44.420 --> 52:46.780\n or most prices set too low, right?\n\n52:46.780 --> 52:49.580\n Shortages everywhere, people trade favors,\n\n52:49.580 --> 52:52.100\n you have this culture of bartered bribes,\n\n52:52.100 --> 52:55.380\n sexual favors or family friends,\n\n52:55.380 --> 52:57.060\n and you get more and more of that,\n\n52:57.060 --> 52:59.780\n and you over time lose more and more of the information\n\n52:59.780 --> 53:03.180\n and the prices and quantities and practices\n\n53:03.180 --> 53:06.220\n and norms you had, and that sort of slowly decays,\n\n53:06.220 --> 53:09.300\n and then by the end no one is believing in it.\n\n53:09.300 --> 53:12.220\n That would be my take, but again, you're the expert here.\n\n53:12.220 --> 53:17.220\n The Russian scholar, well, I'm perhaps no more\n\n53:17.620 --> 53:20.580\n an expert than Ayn Rand, it's more personal\n\n53:20.580 --> 53:25.060\n than it is scholarly or historic.\n\n53:25.060 --> 53:27.660\n So Stalin held power for 30 years,\n\n53:29.060 --> 53:34.060\n Vladimir Putin has held power for 21 years,\n\n53:34.340 --> 53:36.820\n where you could argue he took a little break.\n\n53:36.820 --> 53:39.980\n But not much, he was still holding power, I think.\n\n53:39.980 --> 53:44.900\n And it's still possible now with the new constitution\n\n53:44.900 --> 53:47.500\n that he could hold power from longer than Stalin,\n\n53:47.500 --> 53:48.860\n longer than 30 years.\n\n53:48.860 --> 53:51.380\n What do you think about the man,\n\n53:51.380 --> 53:53.500\n the state of affairs in Russia,\n\n53:54.780 --> 53:57.900\n in general, the system they have there?\n\n53:57.900 --> 53:59.260\n Is there something interesting to you\n\n53:59.260 --> 54:02.300\n as an economist, as a human being, about Russia?\n\n54:02.300 --> 54:03.420\n Everything is interesting.\n\n54:03.420 --> 54:05.980\n I mean, here would be part of my take.\n\n54:05.980 --> 54:10.980\n As you know, the Russian economy starting, what, 1999, 2000,\n\n54:11.060 --> 54:14.180\n has really quite a few years of super excellent growth.\n\n54:15.060 --> 54:17.140\n And Putin is still riding on that.\n\n54:17.140 --> 54:20.580\n It more or less coincides with his rise\n\n54:20.580 --> 54:24.220\n as the truly focal figure on the scene.\n\n54:24.220 --> 54:26.460\n Since then, pretty recently, they've had a bunch of years\n\n54:26.460 --> 54:31.460\n of negative four to 5% growth in a row, which is terrible.\n\n54:31.580 --> 54:35.180\n The economy is way too dependent on fossil fuels,\n\n54:35.180 --> 54:37.660\n but the structural problem is this.\n\n54:37.660 --> 54:40.860\n You need a concordance across economic power,\n\n54:40.860 --> 54:43.140\n social power, political power.\n\n54:43.140 --> 54:45.500\n They don't have to be allocated identically,\n\n54:45.500 --> 54:49.340\n but they have to be allocated consistently.\n\n54:49.340 --> 54:51.100\n And the Russian system under Putin,\n\n54:51.100 --> 54:55.100\n from almost the beginning, has never been able to have that,\n\n54:55.100 --> 54:58.460\n that ultimately his incentives are to steer the system\n\n54:58.460 --> 55:01.660\n where the economic power is in a small number of hands\n\n55:01.660 --> 55:03.900\n in a non diversified way.\n\n55:03.900 --> 55:06.540\n The system won't deliver sustainable gains\n\n55:06.540 --> 55:11.140\n in living standards anymore ever the way it's set up now.\n\n55:11.140 --> 55:13.140\n Though if fossil fuel prices go up,\n\n55:13.140 --> 55:15.780\n they'll have some good years for sure.\n\n55:15.780 --> 55:20.340\n And that is really quite structural, what has gone wrong.\n\n55:20.340 --> 55:23.380\n And then on top of that, you can have an opinion of Putin,\n\n55:23.380 --> 55:25.660\n but you've got to start with those structural problems.\n\n55:25.660 --> 55:28.700\n And that's why it's just not going to work.\n\n55:28.700 --> 55:30.780\n But he had all those good years in the beginning.\n\n55:30.780 --> 55:33.420\n So the number of Russians, say, who live here\n\n55:33.420 --> 55:36.540\n or in Russia, who love Putin and it's sincere,\n\n55:36.540 --> 55:39.260\n they're not just afraid of being dragged away,\n\n55:39.260 --> 55:41.460\n like that's a real phenomenon.\n\n55:41.460 --> 55:45.220\n Yeah, I'm really torn on Putin's approval rating,\n\n55:45.220 --> 55:49.020\n real approval rating seems to be very high.\n\n55:49.020 --> 55:54.020\n And I'm torn in whether that has to do with the fact\n\n55:54.020 --> 55:56.980\n that there is control of the press,\n\n55:58.180 --> 56:01.020\n or if it's, which is the people I talked to\n\n56:01.020 --> 56:04.940\n who are in Russia, family and so on, a genuine love\n\n56:04.940 --> 56:07.860\n of Putin, appreciation of what Putin has done\n\n56:07.860 --> 56:10.180\n and is going to do with Russia.\n\n56:10.180 --> 56:11.620\n And a lot of that would go away\n\n56:11.620 --> 56:13.140\n if the press were freer, I think.\n\n56:13.140 --> 56:15.940\n Yes, well, Singapore realizes this,\n\n56:15.940 --> 56:18.580\n anyone discussed by the press, no matter who they are,\n\n56:18.580 --> 56:20.620\n people in Singapore have done a great job.\n\n56:20.620 --> 56:22.180\n Yes.\n\n56:22.180 --> 56:24.700\n But if you're discussed by the press, you don't look good.\n\n56:24.700 --> 56:27.140\n Tech company executives are learning this, right?\n\n56:27.140 --> 56:28.380\n It's just like a rule.\n\n56:28.380 --> 56:32.220\n So in that sense, I think the rating is artificially high,\n\n56:32.220 --> 56:36.060\n but I don't by any means think it's all insincere,\n\n56:36.060 --> 56:39.460\n but that high popularity I view as bearish for Russia.\n\n56:39.460 --> 56:40.900\n I would feel better about the country\n\n56:40.900 --> 56:43.060\n if people were more pissed off at him.\n\n56:43.060 --> 56:44.180\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n56:44.180 --> 56:47.260\n It's nice to see free speech, even if it's full of hate.\n\n56:49.620 --> 56:52.860\n I am also troubled on the scientific side\n\n56:52.860 --> 56:55.420\n and entrepreneurial side, it seems difficult\n\n56:55.420 --> 56:58.500\n to be an entrepreneur in Russia.\n\n56:58.500 --> 57:03.060\n Like it's not even in terms of rules,\n\n57:03.060 --> 57:06.180\n it's just culturally, the people I speak to,\n\n57:06.180 --> 57:11.180\n it's not easy to build a business, no.\n\n57:11.580 --> 57:15.740\n It's not easy to even dream of building a business in Russia.\n\n57:15.740 --> 57:17.140\n That's just not part of the culture,\n\n57:17.140 --> 57:19.020\n part of the conversation.\n\n57:19.020 --> 57:21.700\n It's almost like the conversation is,\n\n57:21.700 --> 57:25.220\n if you wanna be the next Bill Gates or Elon Musk,\n\n57:25.220 --> 57:28.820\n or Steve Jobs or whatever, you come to America.\n\n57:28.820 --> 57:29.980\n That's the sense they have.\n\n57:29.980 --> 57:32.460\n Yeah, history matters.\n\n57:34.140 --> 57:37.340\n Is it history, is it structural problems of today?\n\n57:37.340 --> 57:38.460\n It's all the same thing.\n\n57:38.460 --> 57:40.620\n So a history of hostility to commerce,\n\n57:40.620 --> 57:44.140\n which of course the old USSR is gone,\n\n57:45.300 --> 57:47.220\n but a lot of the attitudes remain,\n\n57:47.220 --> 57:49.140\n a lot of the corruption remains.\n\n57:49.140 --> 57:51.020\n You have this legacy distribution of wealth\n\n57:51.020 --> 57:53.220\n from the auctioning off of the assets,\n\n57:53.220 --> 57:56.460\n which is not conducive to some kind of broadly egalitarian\n\n57:56.460 --> 57:59.340\n democracy, and so you have these small number\n\n57:59.340 --> 58:03.100\n of power points that try to control information and wealth\n\n58:03.100 --> 58:06.180\n and not really so keen to encourage the others\n\n58:06.180 --> 58:08.900\n who ultimately would pull the balance of political power\n\n58:08.900 --> 58:11.620\n away from the very wealthy and from Putin,\n\n58:11.620 --> 58:13.380\n and they support that culture,\n\n58:13.380 --> 58:16.300\n and the return of interest in Orthodox Church and all that,\n\n58:16.300 --> 58:19.300\n it's all part of the same piece, I think,\n\n58:19.300 --> 58:22.140\n because the old Orthodox Church is not that pro commerce,\n\n58:22.140 --> 58:24.220\n you'd have to say, but it's traditionalist,\n\n58:24.220 --> 58:27.380\n it's pro family, those are safer ideas,\n\n58:27.380 --> 58:29.420\n and then there's such a great safety valve,\n\n58:29.420 --> 58:31.420\n the most ambitious, smartest people,\n\n58:31.420 --> 58:33.660\n like they probably will learn English,\n\n58:33.660 --> 58:35.820\n they sort of can look like they belong\n\n58:35.820 --> 58:37.140\n in all sorts of other countries,\n\n58:37.140 --> 58:39.700\n they can show up and blend in, super talented,\n\n58:39.700 --> 58:42.300\n they've probably had an excellent education,\n\n58:42.300 --> 58:44.460\n especially if they're from one of the two major cities,\n\n58:44.460 --> 58:47.260\n but even if not so, even from Siberia,\n\n58:47.260 --> 58:49.180\n and they go off, they leave,\n\n58:49.180 --> 58:51.220\n they're not a source of opposition,\n\n58:51.220 --> 58:52.780\n and that keeps the whole thing up and running\n\n58:52.780 --> 58:54.740\n for another generation.\n\n58:54.740 --> 58:59.740\n Yeah, what do you make of the other big player, China?\n\n59:01.460 --> 59:05.380\n They seem to have a very different messed up,\n\n59:05.380 --> 59:09.500\n but also functioning system.\n\n59:09.500 --> 59:13.860\n They seem to be much better at encouraging entrepreneurs.\n\n59:13.860 --> 59:15.660\n They're choosing winners,\n\n59:15.660 --> 59:18.340\n but what do you make of the entire Chinese system?\n\n59:18.340 --> 59:22.500\n Why does it work as well as it does currently?\n\n59:22.500 --> 59:24.340\n What are your concerns about it,\n\n59:24.340 --> 59:28.180\n and what are its threats to the United States,\n\n59:28.180 --> 59:32.780\n or possible, what is it you said,\n\n59:32.780 --> 59:34.900\n wisdom isn't when two ideas come together,\n\n59:34.900 --> 59:36.940\n is there some possible benefits\n\n59:36.940 --> 59:40.420\n of these kinds of ideas coming together?\n\n59:40.420 --> 59:42.940\n It's amazing what China has done,\n\n59:42.940 --> 59:44.780\n but I would say to put it in perspective,\n\n59:44.780 --> 59:47.700\n if you compare them to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,\n\n59:47.700 --> 59:49.500\n Hong Kong, and Singapore,\n\n59:49.500 --> 59:53.460\n they've still done much worse, not even close.\n\n59:53.460 --> 59:55.140\n And that's both living standards,\n\n59:55.140 --> 59:58.060\n or I hesitate to cite democracy\n\n59:58.060 --> 1:00:00.620\n as an unalloyed good in and of itself,\n\n1:00:00.620 --> 1:00:04.020\n but there's more freedom in all those other places by a lot.\n\n1:00:04.020 --> 1:00:07.100\n So China has all these problems of history,\n\n1:00:07.100 --> 1:00:09.580\n but they've managed, as actually the Soviets did\n\n1:00:09.580 --> 1:00:11.380\n in the middle of the 20th century,\n\n1:00:12.300 --> 1:00:14.020\n one of the two great mass migrations\n\n1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:15.780\n from the countryside to cities,\n\n1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:18.220\n which boosts productivity enormously\n\n1:00:18.220 --> 1:00:21.020\n and will sustain totalitarian systems,\n\n1:00:21.020 --> 1:00:24.620\n but they moved from a totalitarian system to an oligarchy\n\n1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:29.140\n where the CCP is actually, at least for a while,\n\n1:00:29.140 --> 1:00:31.140\n hey, have been really good at governing,\n\n1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:33.740\n have made a lot of very good decisions.\n\n1:00:33.740 --> 1:00:35.580\n You have to admit that.\n\n1:00:35.580 --> 1:00:38.420\n I don't know how long that streak will continue\n\n1:00:38.420 --> 1:00:43.420\n with one person so much now holding authority\n\n1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:45.820\n in a more extreme manner.\n\n1:00:45.820 --> 1:00:48.140\n The selection pressures for the next generation\n\n1:00:48.140 --> 1:00:52.620\n of high level CCP members probably become much worse.\n\n1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:55.260\n You have this general problem of the state owned enterprise\n\n1:00:55.260 --> 1:00:57.100\n is losing relative productivity\n\n1:00:57.100 --> 1:00:58.780\n compared to the private sector.\n\n1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:02.620\n Well, we're gonna kind of hold Jack Ma on this island\n\n1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:05.260\n and he can only issue like weird hello statements.\n\n1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:08.660\n It kind of smells bad to me.\n\n1:01:08.660 --> 1:01:10.900\n I don't feel that it's about to crash,\n\n1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:14.740\n but I don't see them supplanting America\n\n1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:17.300\n as like the world's number one country.\n\n1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:19.260\n I think they will muddle through\n\n1:01:19.260 --> 1:01:21.740\n and have very serious problems,\n\n1:01:21.740 --> 1:01:24.020\n but there's enough talent there they will muddle through.\n\n1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:26.620\n Is there ideas from China or from anywhere in general\n\n1:01:26.620 --> 1:01:29.340\n of large scale role of government\n\n1:01:29.340 --> 1:01:30.500\n that you find might be useful?\n\n1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.780\n Like Andrew Yang recently ran on a platform,\n\n1:01:33.780 --> 1:01:37.140\n UBI, right, Universal Basic Income.\n\n1:01:37.140 --> 1:01:42.140\n Is there some interesting ideas of large scale\n\n1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:47.580\n government sort of welfare programs at scale\n\n1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:50.380\n that you find interesting?\n\n1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:54.260\n Well, keep in mind the current version\n\n1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:57.900\n of the Chinese Communist Party post now dismantled\n\n1:01:57.900 --> 1:02:00.020\n what was called the iron rice ball.\n\n1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:02.340\n So it took apart the healthcare protections,\n\n1:02:02.340 --> 1:02:05.900\n a lot of the welfare system, a lot of the guaranteed jobs.\n\n1:02:05.900 --> 1:02:08.100\n So the economic rise of China coincided\n\n1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:10.500\n with the weakening of welfare.\n\n1:02:10.500 --> 1:02:12.980\n I'm not saying that's causal per se,\n\n1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:16.820\n but people think of China as having a government\n\n1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:19.460\n that takes care of everyone, it's very far from the truth.\n\n1:02:19.460 --> 1:02:20.900\n And by a lot of metrics,\n\n1:02:20.900 --> 1:02:23.540\n I don't mean control over people's lives,\n\n1:02:23.540 --> 1:02:25.820\n I don't mean speech, but by a lot of metrics,\n\n1:02:25.820 --> 1:02:28.900\n economically we have a lot more government than they do.\n\n1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:32.740\n So what one means here by like government, private control,\n\n1:02:32.740 --> 1:02:35.100\n I don't think you can just add up the numbers\n\n1:02:35.100 --> 1:02:36.740\n and get a simple answer.\n\n1:02:36.740 --> 1:02:40.780\n They've been fantastic at building infrastructure in cities\n\n1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:44.020\n in ways that will attract people from the countryside.\n\n1:02:44.020 --> 1:02:47.540\n And furthermore, they more or less enforce a meritocracy\n\n1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:48.980\n in this sense.\n\n1:02:48.980 --> 1:02:51.380\n Like if you're a kid of a rich guy,\n\n1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:53.220\n you'll get unfair privilege.\n\n1:02:53.220 --> 1:02:56.020\n That's unfair, but systems can afford that.\n\n1:02:56.020 --> 1:02:57.820\n If you are smart and from the countryside\n\n1:02:57.820 --> 1:02:59.780\n and your parents have nothing,\n\n1:02:59.780 --> 1:03:02.620\n you will be elevated and sent to a very good school,\n\n1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:05.180\n graduate school because of the exam system.\n\n1:03:05.180 --> 1:03:08.580\n And they do that and they mean that very consistently.\n\n1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:10.260\n It's like the Soviets had a version of that\n\n1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:12.460\n like for chess and romantic piano.\n\n1:03:12.460 --> 1:03:14.980\n Not for everything, but where they had it,\n\n1:03:14.980 --> 1:03:17.420\n like again, they were tremendous, right?\n\n1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:18.260\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:03:18.260 --> 1:03:21.060\n And Chinese have it in so many areas,\n\n1:03:21.060 --> 1:03:23.580\n a genuine meritocracy in this one way.\n\n1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:26.460\n That moves people from the rural to the big city\n\n1:03:26.460 --> 1:03:29.060\n and that's a big boost of productivity\n\n1:03:29.060 --> 1:03:30.500\n for some amount of time.\n\n1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:32.300\n And when they get there, they're taken seriously.\n\n1:03:32.300 --> 1:03:34.020\n Jack Ma was riding a bicycle,\n\n1:03:34.020 --> 1:03:35.740\n teaching English in his late 20s.\n\n1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:36.780\n He was a poor guy.\n\n1:03:39.180 --> 1:03:41.540\n Not a society of credentialism.\n\n1:03:41.540 --> 1:03:45.460\n Or in America, it's way too much a credentialist society.\n\n1:03:45.460 --> 1:03:47.940\n As we're talking about even with the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:03:47.940 --> 1:03:51.340\n But what do you think about these large government programs\n\n1:03:51.340 --> 1:03:53.180\n like UBI?\n\n1:03:53.180 --> 1:03:55.860\n The one version of UBI that makes the most sense to me\n\n1:03:55.860 --> 1:03:59.300\n is the Mitt Romney version, UBI for kids.\n\n1:03:59.300 --> 1:04:00.660\n Like kids are vulnerable.\n\n1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:03.060\n If their parents screw up, you shouldn't blame the kid\n\n1:04:03.060 --> 1:04:04.980\n or make the kids suffer.\n\n1:04:04.980 --> 1:04:07.580\n I believe in something like UBI for kids.\n\n1:04:07.580 --> 1:04:08.740\n Maybe just cash.\n\n1:04:09.900 --> 1:04:13.540\n But if you don't have kids, even with AI,\n\n1:04:13.540 --> 1:04:16.420\n my sense is at least in the world we know,\n\n1:04:16.420 --> 1:04:19.020\n you should be able to find a way to adjust.\n\n1:04:19.020 --> 1:04:22.820\n You might have to move to North Dakota to work,\n\n1:04:24.420 --> 1:04:26.020\n next to fracking, say.\n\n1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:28.100\n But look, before the pandemic,\n\n1:04:28.100 --> 1:04:30.540\n the two most robot intensive societies,\n\n1:04:30.540 --> 1:04:33.940\n Japan and the US, US at least for manufacturing,\n\n1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:35.860\n were at full employment.\n\n1:04:35.860 --> 1:04:37.700\n So maybe there's some far off day\n\n1:04:37.700 --> 1:04:39.660\n where there's literally no work, John Lennon,\n\n1:04:39.660 --> 1:04:43.100\n and imagine it's piped everywhere.\n\n1:04:44.060 --> 1:04:47.020\n And then we might revisit the question.\n\n1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:51.020\n But for now, we had rising wages in the Trump years\n\n1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:52.540\n and full employment.\n\n1:04:52.540 --> 1:04:54.580\n So I don't see the point.\n\n1:04:54.580 --> 1:04:57.580\n You don't see automation as a threat\n\n1:04:57.580 --> 1:05:00.340\n that fundamentally shakes our society.\n\n1:05:00.340 --> 1:05:01.940\n It's a threat in the following sense.\n\n1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:04.220\n The new technologies are harder to work with\n\n1:05:04.220 --> 1:05:07.260\n for many people, and that's a social problem.\n\n1:05:07.260 --> 1:05:10.420\n But I'm not sure a universal basic income\n\n1:05:10.420 --> 1:05:13.460\n is the right answer to that very real problem.\n\n1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:16.780\n Well, that's also, I like the UBI for kids.\n\n1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:20.260\n It's also your definition or the line,\n\n1:05:20.260 --> 1:05:21.940\n the threshold for what is vulnerable\n\n1:05:21.940 --> 1:05:24.740\n and what is basic human nature.\n\n1:05:24.740 --> 1:05:27.020\n Going back to Russia, life is suffering.\n\n1:05:27.860 --> 1:05:31.220\n That struggle is a part of life.\n\n1:05:31.220 --> 1:05:33.700\n And perhaps sort of changing,\n\n1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:36.460\n maybe what defines the 21st century\n\n1:05:36.460 --> 1:05:38.100\n is having multiple careers\n\n1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:41.140\n and adjusting and learning and evolving.\n\n1:05:41.140 --> 1:05:45.540\n And some of the technology in terms of,\n\n1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:50.620\n some of the technology we see like the internet\n\n1:05:50.620 --> 1:05:55.620\n allows us to make those pivots easier,\n\n1:05:55.820 --> 1:05:59.060\n allows later life education possible.\n\n1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:00.700\n It makes it possible.\n\n1:06:00.700 --> 1:06:01.540\n I don't know.\n\n1:06:01.540 --> 1:06:03.100\n And your earlier point about loneliness\n\n1:06:03.100 --> 1:06:04.700\n being this fundamental human problem,\n\n1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:07.220\n which I would agree with strongly,\n\n1:06:07.220 --> 1:06:10.260\n UBI, if it's at a high level, will make that worse.\n\n1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:11.700\n I mean, say UBI were higher enough,\n\n1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:13.060\n you could just sit at home.\n\n1:06:14.900 --> 1:06:16.460\n People are not gonna be happy.\n\n1:06:16.460 --> 1:06:18.300\n They don't actually want that.\n\n1:06:18.300 --> 1:06:21.500\n And we've relearned that in the pandemic.\n\n1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:24.060\n Yeah, the flip side, the hope with UBI\n\n1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:26.340\n is you have a little bit more freedom\n\n1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:29.260\n to find the thing that alleviates your loneliness.\n\n1:06:29.260 --> 1:06:30.740\n That's the idea.\n\n1:06:30.740 --> 1:06:33.340\n So it's kind of an open question.\n\n1:06:33.340 --> 1:06:38.260\n If I give you a million dollars or a billion dollars,\n\n1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:41.660\n will you pursue the thing you love?\n\n1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:45.820\n Will you be more motivated to find the thing you love,\n\n1:06:45.820 --> 1:06:46.700\n to do the thing you love,\n\n1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:50.140\n or will you be lazy and lose yourself\n\n1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:52.340\n in the sort of daily activities\n\n1:06:52.340 --> 1:06:54.860\n that don't actually bring you joy,\n\n1:06:54.860 --> 1:06:57.700\n but pacify you in some kind of way\n\n1:06:57.700 --> 1:07:01.300\n where you just let the days slip by?\n\n1:07:01.300 --> 1:07:02.740\n That's the open question.\n\n1:07:02.740 --> 1:07:05.580\n A lot of the great creators did not have huge cushions,\n\n1:07:05.580 --> 1:07:07.580\n whether it was Mozart or James Brown\n\n1:07:07.580 --> 1:07:10.300\n or the great painters in history,\n\n1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:12.380\n they had to work pretty hard.\n\n1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:15.300\n And if you look at heirs to great fortunes,\n\n1:07:15.300 --> 1:07:16.780\n maybe I'm forgetting someone,\n\n1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:18.620\n but it's hard to think of any\n\n1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:21.860\n who have creatively been important as novelists,\n\n1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:25.940\n or they might have continued to run the family business.\n\n1:07:25.940 --> 1:07:30.700\n But Van Gogh was not heir to a great family fortune.\n\n1:07:30.700 --> 1:07:34.460\n It's sad that cushions get in the way of progress.\n\n1:07:37.100 --> 1:07:39.820\n It's the same point about prizes, right?\n\n1:07:39.820 --> 1:07:42.300\n Inheriting too much money is like winning a prize.\n\n1:07:42.300 --> 1:07:45.780\n We mentioned Eric, Eric Weinstein.\n\n1:07:45.780 --> 1:07:47.180\n I know you agree on a bunch of things.\n\n1:07:47.180 --> 1:07:49.260\n Is there some beautiful, fascinating,\n\n1:07:49.260 --> 1:07:51.700\n insightful disagreement that you have\n\n1:07:51.700 --> 1:07:54.100\n that has yet to be resolved with him?\n\n1:07:54.100 --> 1:07:58.140\n Is there some ideas that you guys battle it out on?\n\n1:07:58.140 --> 1:08:00.560\n Is it the stagnation question that you mentioned?\n\n1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:03.760\n That's one of them, but here's at least two others.\n\n1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:08.000\n But I would stress Eric is always evolving.\n\n1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.700\n So I'm just talking about a time slice Eric, right?\n\n1:08:10.700 --> 1:08:12.940\n I don't know where he's at right now.\n\n1:08:12.940 --> 1:08:15.020\n Like I heard him on Clubhouse three nights ago,\n\n1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:16.580\n but that was three nights ago.\n\n1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:20.060\n But I think he's far too pessimistic\n\n1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:23.500\n about the impact of immigration on U.S. science.\n\n1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:26.580\n He thinks it has displaced U.S. scientists,\n\n1:08:26.580 --> 1:08:28.700\n which I think that is partly true.\n\n1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:30.300\n I just think we've gotten better talent.\n\n1:08:30.300 --> 1:08:33.180\n I'm like, bring it on, double down.\n\n1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:35.820\n And look at Kiriko, who basically came up\n\n1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:37.980\n with mRNA vaccines, she was from Hungary.\n\n1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:41.140\n And was ridiculed and mocked,\n\n1:08:41.140 --> 1:08:42.780\n she couldn't get her papers published.\n\n1:08:42.780 --> 1:08:43.820\n She stuck at it.\n\n1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:47.900\n An American might not have been so stubborn\n\n1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:49.760\n because we have these cushions.\n\n1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:52.860\n So Eric is all worried, like mathematicians coming in,\n\n1:08:52.860 --> 1:08:56.940\n they're discouraging native U.S. citizens from doing math.\n\n1:08:56.940 --> 1:08:59.460\n I'm like, bring in the best people.\n\n1:08:59.460 --> 1:09:02.720\n If we all end up in other avocations,\n\n1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:04.100\n absolutely fine by me.\n\n1:09:04.100 --> 1:09:06.820\n Does it trouble you that we kick them out\n\n1:09:06.820 --> 1:09:08.700\n after they get a degree often?\n\n1:09:08.700 --> 1:09:11.460\n I would give anyone with a plausible graduate degree\n\n1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:13.460\n a green card, universally.\n\n1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:17.140\n Yeah, I agree with that, it makes no sense.\n\n1:09:17.140 --> 1:09:19.940\n It makes so strange that the best people that come here\n\n1:09:19.940 --> 1:09:22.660\n suffer here, create awesome stuff here,\n\n1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:24.460\n then when we kick them out, it doesn't make any sense.\n\n1:09:24.460 --> 1:09:25.580\n Here's another view I have.\n\n1:09:25.580 --> 1:09:27.720\n I call it open borders for Belarus.\n\n1:09:29.140 --> 1:09:30.340\n Now Russia's a big country.\n\n1:09:30.340 --> 1:09:33.460\n I would gladly increase the Russian quota\n\n1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:38.460\n by three X, four X, five X, not 20%, but a big boost.\n\n1:09:39.380 --> 1:09:44.300\n But Belarus, a small country, and they're poor,\n\n1:09:44.300 --> 1:09:47.780\n and they have decent education, and a lot of talent there.\n\n1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:50.140\n Why can't we just open the door\n\n1:09:50.140 --> 1:09:53.500\n and convert a Belarus passport to a green card?\n\n1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:56.660\n Open borders for Belarus, it's my new campaign slogan.\n\n1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:58.740\n Are you running for president in 2024?\n\n1:09:58.740 --> 1:10:00.460\n Well, write ins are welcome, but.\n\n1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:04.380\n Okay, what's the second thing you disagree with, Eric?\n\n1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:10.220\n Trade, again, I'm not sure where he's at now,\n\n1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:14.820\n but he is suspicious of trade in a way that I am not.\n\n1:10:14.820 --> 1:10:17.300\n I do understand what's called the China shock\n\n1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:19.860\n has been a big problem for the US middle class.\n\n1:10:19.860 --> 1:10:21.380\n I fully accept that.\n\n1:10:21.380 --> 1:10:24.020\n I think most of that is behind us.\n\n1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:25.960\n National security issues aside,\n\n1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:29.200\n I think free trade is very much a good thing.\n\n1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:33.060\n Eric, I'm not sure he'll say it's not a good thing,\n\n1:10:33.060 --> 1:10:34.840\n but he won't say it is a good thing.\n\n1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:38.160\n And I know he's kind of, it's like, Eric, free trade.\n\n1:10:39.420 --> 1:10:40.920\n But look, on things like vaccines,\n\n1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:42.880\n I don't believe in free trade.\n\n1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:45.540\n You want vaccine production in your own country,\n\n1:10:45.540 --> 1:10:47.000\n look at the EU.\n\n1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:50.160\n They have enough money, no one will send them vaccines.\n\n1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:51.940\n What's different about vaccines?\n\n1:10:51.940 --> 1:10:54.520\n Is it, there's some things you want to prioritize\n\n1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.440\n the citizenry on.\n\n1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:58.120\n You could argue it would be cheaper\n\n1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:02.040\n to produce all US manufactured vaccines in India.\n\n1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:05.960\n They have the technologies, obviously lower wages,\n\n1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:07.560\n but look, there's talk in India right now\n\n1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.880\n of cutting off the export of vaccines.\n\n1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:12.000\n If you outsource your vaccine production,\n\n1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.400\n you're not sure the other country\n\n1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:15.840\n will respect the norm of free trade.\n\n1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:20.160\n So you need to keep some vaccine production in your country.\n\n1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:22.560\n It's an exception to free trade, not to the logic,\n\n1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:26.480\n a bunch of things the Navy uses.\n\n1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:28.520\n You can't buy those components from China.\n\n1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:29.380\n That's insane.\n\n1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:34.140\n But look, it would be cheaper to do so, right?\n\n1:11:34.140 --> 1:11:35.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:37.360\n Let me completely shift topics\n\n1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.720\n on something that's fascinating.\n\n1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:40.960\n It's all the same topic, but great.\n\n1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:42.880\n Everything is interesting.\n\n1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:48.800\n What do you think about what the hell is money?\n\n1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:53.800\n And the recent excitement around cryptocurrency\n\n1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:01.120\n that brings to the forefront\n\n1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:04.880\n the philosophical discussion of the nature of money.\n\n1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:06.840\n Are you bullish on cryptocurrency?\n\n1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:07.900\n Are you excited about it?\n\n1:12:07.900 --> 1:12:09.560\n What does it make you think about\n\n1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:11.840\n how the nature of money is changing?\n\n1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:13.720\n No one knows what money is.\n\n1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:15.560\n Probably no one ever knew.\n\n1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:17.920\n Go back to medieval times, bills of exchange.\n\n1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:19.460\n Were they money?\n\n1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:21.500\n Maybe it's just a semantic debate.\n\n1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:23.360\n Gold, silver, what about copper coins?\n\n1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:26.380\n What about metals that were considered legal tender\n\n1:12:26.380 --> 1:12:28.280\n but not always circulating?\n\n1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:29.700\n What about credit?\n\n1:12:29.700 --> 1:12:32.480\n So being confused about moneyness\n\n1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.240\n is the natural state of affairs for human beings.\n\n1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:36.240\n And if there's more of that,\n\n1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:38.880\n I'd say that's probably a good thing.\n\n1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:42.920\n Now, crypto per se, I think Bitcoin has taken over\n\n1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:45.560\n a lot of the space held by gold.\n\n1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:48.160\n That to me seems sustainable.\n\n1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:50.360\n I'm not short Bitcoin.\n\n1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:53.460\n I don't have some view that the price\n\n1:12:53.460 --> 1:12:55.100\n has to be different than the current price,\n\n1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:56.840\n but I know it changes every moment.\n\n1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:01.180\n I am deeply uncertain about the less of crypto,\n\n1:13:01.180 --> 1:13:04.480\n which seems connected to ultimate visions\n\n1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:09.360\n of using it for transactions in ways where I'm not sure\n\n1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:12.460\n whether it be prediction markets or DeFi.\n\n1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:16.200\n I'm not sure the retail demand really is there\n\n1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:18.520\n once it is regulated like everything else is.\n\n1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:24.360\n I would say I'm 40, 60 optimistic on those forms of crypto.\n\n1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:26.020\n That is, I think it's somewhat more likely\n\n1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:29.140\n they fail than succeed, but I take them very seriously.\n\n1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:31.160\n So we're talking about it becoming\n\n1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:32.920\n one of the main currencies in the world.\n\n1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:33.760\n That's what we're discussing.\n\n1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:35.720\n That I don't think will happen.\n\n1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:40.420\n So, but the reality is that Bitcoin used to be\n\n1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:44.720\n in the single digits of a dollar and now has crossed $50,000\n\n1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:46.600\n for a single Bitcoin.\n\n1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:48.600\n Do you think it's possible it reaches\n\n1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:50.300\n something like a million dollars?\n\n1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:54.280\n I don't think we have a good theory of the value of Bitcoin.\n\n1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:56.160\n If people decide it's worth a million dollars,\n\n1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:57.760\n it's worth a million dollars.\n\n1:13:57.760 --> 1:13:58.600\n But isn't that money?\n\n1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:01.640\n Like you said, isn't the ultimate state of money confusion,\n\n1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:03.200\n however beautifully you put it?\n\n1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:05.040\n It's like valuing an Andy Warhol painting.\n\n1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:06.960\n So when Warhol started off,\n\n1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:08.880\n probably those things had no value.\n\n1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:11.560\n They were sketches, early sketches of shoes.\n\n1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:14.960\n Now a good Warhol could be worth over 50 million.\n\n1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:17.600\n That's an incredible rate of price appreciation.\n\n1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:20.640\n Bitcoin is seeing a similar trajectory.\n\n1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:23.780\n I don't pretend to know where it will stop,\n\n1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:25.240\n but it's about trying to figure out\n\n1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:26.760\n what do people think of Andy Warhol?\n\n1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:29.600\n He could be out of fashion in a century.\n\n1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.220\n Maybe yes, maybe no.\n\n1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:35.300\n But you don't think about Warhols as money.\n\n1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:38.640\n They perform some money like functions.\n\n1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:40.640\n You can even use them as collateral\n\n1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:42.400\n for like deals between gangs.\n\n1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:46.880\n But they're not basically money, nor is Bitcoin.\n\n1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:48.960\n And the transactions velocity of Bitcoin,\n\n1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:51.320\n I would think is likely to fall, if anything.\n\n1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.320\n So you don't think there'll be some kind of phase shift\n\n1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:55.440\n where it become adopted and become mainstream\n\n1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:00.200\n for one of the main mechanisms of transactions?\n\n1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:01.020\n Bitcoin, no.\n\n1:15:01.020 --> 1:15:03.380\n Now, you know, ether has some chance at that.\n\n1:15:03.380 --> 1:15:04.840\n I would bet against it,\n\n1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:06.840\n but I wouldn't give you a definitive no.\n\n1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:07.680\n And you wouldn't put us here.\n\n1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:09.020\n Bitcoin is too costly.\n\n1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:12.400\n It may be fine to hold it like gold,\n\n1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:13.920\n but gold is also costly.\n\n1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:18.360\n You have smart people trying to make, say, ether,\n\n1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:21.600\n much more effective as a currency than Bitcoin.\n\n1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.600\n And there's certainly a decent chance they will succeed.\n\n1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:26.720\n Yeah, there's a lot of innovation.\n\n1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:30.120\n I mean, with smart contracts, with NFTs as well,\n\n1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:33.440\n there's a lot of interesting innovations\n\n1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:36.120\n that are plugging into the human psyche somehow,\n\n1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:37.760\n just like money does.\n\n1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.360\n You know, money seems to be this viral thing,\n\n1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:43.080\n our ideas of money, right?\n\n1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:45.360\n And if the idea is strong enough,\n\n1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:47.740\n it seems to be able to take hold.\n\n1:15:47.740 --> 1:15:50.880\n Like there's network effects that just take over.\n\n1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:54.060\n And like, I particularly see that with,\n\n1:15:54.060 --> 1:15:57.400\n I'd love to get your comment on Dogecoin,\n\n1:15:57.400 --> 1:15:59.760\n which is basically by a single human being,\n\n1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:01.400\n Elon Musk has been created.\n\n1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:03.200\n You know, it's like these celebrities\n\n1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:07.160\n can have a huge ripple effect on the impact of money.\n\n1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:11.560\n Is it possible that in the 21st century,\n\n1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:13.840\n people like Elon Musk and celebrities,\n\n1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:16.120\n I don't know, Donald Trump, The Rock,\n\n1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:20.680\n whoever else, can actually define,\n\n1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:22.320\n you know, the currencies that we use?\n\n1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:26.000\n Maybe can Dogecoin become the primary currency of the world?\n\n1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:29.280\n I think of it as like baseball cards.\n\n1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:32.800\n So right now, every baseball player has a baseball card.\n\n1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:34.120\n And the players who are stars,\n\n1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:37.280\n their cards can end up worth a fair amount of money.\n\n1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:39.680\n And that's stable, we've had it for many decades.\n\n1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:42.840\n Sort of the player defines the card,\n\n1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:46.200\n they sign a contract with Topps or whatever company.\n\n1:16:46.200 --> 1:16:49.040\n Now, could you imagine celebrities, baseball players,\n\n1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.000\n LeBron James, having their own currencies instead of cards?\n\n1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.960\n Absolutely, and you're somewhat seeing that right now,\n\n1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:58.320\n as you mentioned, artists with these unique works\n\n1:16:58.320 --> 1:16:59.340\n on the blockchain.\n\n1:16:59.340 --> 1:17:02.340\n But I'm not sure those are macroeconomically important.\n\n1:17:02.340 --> 1:17:04.140\n If it's just a new class of collectibles\n\n1:17:04.140 --> 1:17:07.380\n that people have fun with, again, I say, bring it on.\n\n1:17:08.260 --> 1:17:11.140\n But whether there are use cases beyond that,\n\n1:17:11.140 --> 1:17:15.380\n that challenge fiat monies, which actually work very well.\n\n1:17:15.380 --> 1:17:19.340\n Yesterday, I sent money to a family in Ethiopia\n\n1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:21.100\n that I helped support.\n\n1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:24.020\n In less than 24 hours, they got that money.\n\n1:17:24.020 --> 1:17:26.300\n Digitally, yes.\n\n1:17:26.300 --> 1:17:28.340\n No, not digitally, through my bank.\n\n1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:32.220\n My primitive dinosaur bank, BB&T, Mid Atlantic Bank,\n\n1:17:32.220 --> 1:17:34.500\n headquartered in North Carolina,\n\n1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:38.340\n charted by the Fed, regulated by the FDAC and the OCC.\n\n1:17:38.340 --> 1:17:41.620\n Now, you could say, well, the exchange rate was not so great.\n\n1:17:44.220 --> 1:17:46.580\n I don't see crypto as close to beating that\n\n1:17:46.580 --> 1:17:49.500\n once you take into account all of the last mile problems.\n\n1:17:50.580 --> 1:17:52.660\n Fiat currency works really well.\n\n1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:54.820\n People are not sitting around bitching about it.\n\n1:17:54.820 --> 1:17:56.260\n And when you talk to crypto people,\n\n1:17:56.260 --> 1:17:58.500\n they're crypto people, the number who have to postulate\n\n1:17:58.500 --> 1:18:00.700\n some out of the blue hyperinflation,\n\n1:18:00.700 --> 1:18:03.300\n where there's no evidence for that whatsoever,\n\n1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:06.060\n that to me is a sign they're not thinking clearly\n\n1:18:06.060 --> 1:18:07.620\n about how hard they have to work\n\n1:18:07.620 --> 1:18:09.220\n to outcompete fiat currency.\n\n1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:11.860\n There's a bunch of different technologies\n\n1:18:11.860 --> 1:18:15.860\n that are really exciting that don't want to address\n\n1:18:15.860 --> 1:18:17.780\n how difficult it is to outcompete\n\n1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:19.220\n the current accepted alternative.\n\n1:18:19.220 --> 1:18:21.780\n So for example, autonomous vehicles.\n\n1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:24.100\n A lot of people are really excited.\n\n1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:28.060\n But it's not trivial to outcompete Uber\n\n1:18:28.060 --> 1:18:32.300\n on the cost and the effectiveness and the user experience\n\n1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:34.940\n and all those kinds of, sorry, Uber driven by humans.\n\n1:18:34.940 --> 1:18:39.380\n And it's not, you know, that's taken for granted,\n\n1:18:39.380 --> 1:18:41.980\n I think, that look, wouldn't it be amazing,\n\n1:18:41.980 --> 1:18:43.260\n how amazing would the world look\n\n1:18:43.260 --> 1:18:45.580\n when the cars are driving themselves fully,\n\n1:18:45.580 --> 1:18:47.220\n you know, it's gonna drive the cost down,\n\n1:18:47.220 --> 1:18:48.620\n you can remove the cost of drivers,\n\n1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:50.180\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:52.180\n But it's when you actually get down to it\n\n1:18:52.180 --> 1:18:53.620\n and have to build a business around it,\n\n1:18:53.620 --> 1:18:55.500\n it's actually very difficult to do.\n\n1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:56.860\n And I guess you're saying your sense\n\n1:18:56.860 --> 1:19:00.300\n is similar competition is facing cryptocurrency.\n\n1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:05.300\n Like you have to actually present a killer app reason\n\n1:19:06.740 --> 1:19:11.740\n to switch from fiat currency to Ethereum or to whatever.\n\n1:19:12.900 --> 1:19:15.500\n And the Biden people are gonna regulate crypto\n\n1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:16.980\n and they're gonna do it soon.\n\n1:19:16.980 --> 1:19:20.700\n So something like DeFi, I fully get why that is cheaper\n\n1:19:20.700 --> 1:19:23.300\n or for some can be cheaper than other ways\n\n1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:25.620\n of conducting financial intermediation.\n\n1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:28.500\n But some of that is regulatory arbitrage.\n\n1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:30.740\n It will not be allowed to go on forever\n\n1:19:30.740 --> 1:19:32.300\n for better or worse.\n\n1:19:32.300 --> 1:19:35.140\n I would rather see it given greater tolerance.\n\n1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:37.540\n But the point is banking lobby is strong.\n\n1:19:37.540 --> 1:19:39.980\n The government will only let it run so far.\n\n1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:41.380\n There'll be capital requirements,\n\n1:19:41.380 --> 1:19:43.420\n reporting requirements imposed,\n\n1:19:43.420 --> 1:19:45.580\n and it will lose a lot of those advantages.\n\n1:19:46.620 --> 1:19:48.820\n What do you make of Wall Street bets?\n\n1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:50.620\n Another thing that recently happened\n\n1:19:50.620 --> 1:19:54.700\n that shook the world and at least me\n\n1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:56.860\n from the outside of perspective,\n\n1:19:56.860 --> 1:19:58.500\n make me question what I do\n\n1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:01.380\n and don't understand about our economics.\n\n1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:03.500\n Which is a bunch of different,\n\n1:20:03.500 --> 1:20:05.140\n a large number of individuals\n\n1:20:05.140 --> 1:20:06.780\n getting together on the internet\n\n1:20:06.780 --> 1:20:10.260\n and having a large scale impact on the markets.\n\n1:20:10.260 --> 1:20:11.740\n If you tell a group of people\n\n1:20:11.740 --> 1:20:13.420\n and coordinate them through the internet,\n\n1:20:13.420 --> 1:20:16.060\n we're gonna play a fun game, it might cost you money,\n\n1:20:16.060 --> 1:20:17.460\n but you're gonna make the headlines\n\n1:20:17.460 --> 1:20:18.860\n and there's a chance you'll screw over\n\n1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:20.820\n some billionaires and hedge funds.\n\n1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:23.020\n Enough people will play that game.\n\n1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:24.260\n So that game might continue,\n\n1:20:24.260 --> 1:20:26.900\n but I don't think it's of macroeconomic importance.\n\n1:20:26.900 --> 1:20:30.660\n And the price of those stocks in the medium term\n\n1:20:30.660 --> 1:20:32.980\n will end up wherever it ought to be.\n\n1:20:32.980 --> 1:20:34.980\n So these are little outliers\n\n1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:36.780\n from a macroeconomics perspective.\n\n1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:38.740\n They're not going to,\n\n1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:43.620\n these are not signals of shifting power,\n\n1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:46.300\n like from centralized power to distributed power.\n\n1:20:46.300 --> 1:20:49.220\n These aren't some fundamental changes in the way\n\n1:20:49.220 --> 1:20:50.260\n our economy works.\n\n1:20:50.260 --> 1:20:52.500\n I think of it as a new brand of eSports,\n\n1:20:52.500 --> 1:20:54.140\n maybe more fun than the old brand.\n\n1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:56.340\n Which is fine, right?\n\n1:20:56.340 --> 1:20:58.540\n It's like push the anarchy into the corners\n\n1:20:58.540 --> 1:20:59.660\n where you want it.\n\n1:20:59.660 --> 1:21:02.700\n It doesn't bother me,\n\n1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:04.100\n but I think people are seeing it\n\n1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:05.260\n as more fun than it is.\n\n1:21:05.260 --> 1:21:07.620\n It's a new eSport, more fun for many,\n\n1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:09.940\n but more expensive than the old eSports.\n\n1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:13.660\n Like chess is a new eSport, super cheap,\n\n1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:16.900\n not as fun as like sending hedge funds to their doom,\n\n1:21:16.900 --> 1:21:19.900\n but like, what would you expect?\n\n1:21:19.900 --> 1:21:22.420\n The poetry, I love it, okay.\n\n1:21:22.420 --> 1:21:24.900\n But macroeconomically, it's not fundamental.\n\n1:21:24.900 --> 1:21:27.380\n Okay, I was going to say, I hope you're right,\n\n1:21:27.380 --> 1:21:29.820\n because I'm uncomfortable with the chaos\n\n1:21:29.820 --> 1:21:32.380\n of the masses that's creates.\n\n1:21:32.380 --> 1:21:36.980\n But I also think that chaos is somewhat real to be clear,\n\n1:21:36.980 --> 1:21:40.620\n but it will matter through other channels,\n\n1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:45.620\n not through manipulating GameStop or AMC.\n\n1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:48.540\n So you're seeing the real macro phenomenon.\n\n1:21:48.540 --> 1:21:50.740\n When people see a real macro phenomenon,\n\n1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:54.020\n they tend to make every micro story fit the narrative.\n\n1:21:54.020 --> 1:21:56.220\n And this micro story, like it fits the narrative,\n\n1:21:56.220 --> 1:21:58.980\n but it doesn't mean its importance fits the narrative.\n\n1:21:58.980 --> 1:22:01.780\n That's how I would kind of dissect the mistake\n\n1:22:01.780 --> 1:22:03.020\n I think people are making.\n\n1:22:05.060 --> 1:22:07.820\n The macro phenomenon that are there, do you mean?\n\n1:22:07.820 --> 1:22:10.540\n Everyone's weird now, the internet.\n\n1:22:10.540 --> 1:22:12.980\n Either allows us to be weirder or makes us weirder.\n\n1:22:12.980 --> 1:22:14.540\n I'm not sure what's the right way to put it.\n\n1:22:14.540 --> 1:22:16.420\n Maybe a mix of both.\n\n1:22:16.420 --> 1:22:18.780\n You're probably right that it allows us to be weirder\n\n1:22:18.780 --> 1:22:21.340\n because, well, this is the other, okay.\n\n1:22:21.340 --> 1:22:23.980\n So this connects our previous conversation.\n\n1:22:23.980 --> 1:22:26.660\n Does America allow us to be weirder\n\n1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:29.220\n or does it make us weirder?\n\n1:22:29.220 --> 1:22:32.300\n Like say we're weird and somewhat neurotic to begin with,\n\n1:22:32.300 --> 1:22:34.940\n but the only messages we get are Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\n1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:37.580\n and I Love Lucy and network TV.\n\n1:22:37.580 --> 1:22:40.060\n Like that's going to keep us within certain bounds.\n\n1:22:40.060 --> 1:22:41.660\n In good and bad ways.\n\n1:22:41.660 --> 1:22:43.860\n That's obviously totally gone.\n\n1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:47.020\n And the internet, you can connect to not just QAnon,\n\n1:22:47.020 --> 1:22:47.980\n but all sorts of things.\n\n1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:49.780\n Many of them just fantastic, right?\n\n1:22:51.260 --> 1:22:54.260\n But in good and bad ways, it makes us weirder.\n\n1:22:54.260 --> 1:22:56.700\n So that maybe is troubling, right?\n\n1:22:56.700 --> 1:22:58.020\n Like if someone's worried about that,\n\n1:22:58.020 --> 1:22:59.580\n I would at least say they should\n\n1:22:59.580 --> 1:23:01.500\n give it deep serious thought.\n\n1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:04.620\n And then it has a whole lot of ebbs and flows,\n\n1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:07.580\n micro realizations of the weirdness\n\n1:23:07.580 --> 1:23:09.580\n that don't actually matter.\n\n1:23:09.580 --> 1:23:10.940\n So like chess players today,\n\n1:23:10.940 --> 1:23:12.580\n they play a lot more weird openings\n\n1:23:12.580 --> 1:23:14.580\n than they did 20 years ago.\n\n1:23:14.580 --> 1:23:16.740\n Like it reflects the same thing\n\n1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:19.140\n because you can research any weird opening on the internet,\n\n1:23:19.140 --> 1:23:21.140\n but like, does that matter?\n\n1:23:21.140 --> 1:23:22.460\n Probably not.\n\n1:23:22.460 --> 1:23:23.780\n So a lot of the things we see\n\n1:23:23.780 --> 1:23:26.020\n are just like the weird chess openings.\n\n1:23:26.020 --> 1:23:28.340\n And to figure out which are like the weird chess openings\n\n1:23:28.340 --> 1:23:31.540\n and which are fundamental to the new and growing weirdness,\n\n1:23:31.540 --> 1:23:33.500\n like that's what a hedge fund investor type\n\n1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:35.020\n should be trying to do.\n\n1:23:35.020 --> 1:23:36.900\n I just think no one knows yet.\n\n1:23:36.900 --> 1:23:40.020\n It's like this itself, this fun weird guessing game,\n\n1:23:40.020 --> 1:23:42.220\n which we're partly engaging in right now.\n\n1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:43.260\n Exactly.\n\n1:23:43.260 --> 1:23:45.220\n And I mean, as Eric talks about\n\n1:23:46.180 --> 1:23:47.980\n on the science side of things,\n\n1:23:47.980 --> 1:23:50.100\n I mean, I said like at MIT,\n\n1:23:50.100 --> 1:23:52.460\n especially in the machine learning field,\n\n1:23:52.460 --> 1:23:56.180\n there's a natural institutional resistance to the weird.\n\n1:23:56.180 --> 1:23:58.220\n It's very, as they talk about,\n\n1:23:58.220 --> 1:24:00.940\n it's difficult to hire weird faculty, for example.\n\n1:24:00.940 --> 1:24:01.780\n Correct.\n\n1:24:03.220 --> 1:24:06.380\n You want to hire and give tenure to people that are safe\n\n1:24:06.380 --> 1:24:07.620\n and not weird.\n\n1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:09.700\n And that's one of the concerns is like,\n\n1:24:09.700 --> 1:24:10.980\n it seems like the weird people\n\n1:24:10.980 --> 1:24:13.060\n are the ones that push the science forward usually.\n\n1:24:13.060 --> 1:24:14.060\n Right.\n\n1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:16.620\n And so like, how do you balance the two?\n\n1:24:16.620 --> 1:24:17.820\n It's not obvious.\n\n1:24:17.820 --> 1:24:20.500\n Because it's another area where Eric and I disagree.\n\n1:24:20.500 --> 1:24:21.940\n As I interpret him,\n\n1:24:21.940 --> 1:24:24.460\n he thinks academia is totally bankrupt.\n\n1:24:24.460 --> 1:24:26.540\n And I think it's only partially bankrupt.\n\n1:24:27.860 --> 1:24:28.700\n How do we fix it?\n\n1:24:28.700 --> 1:24:31.980\n Because I'm with you, I'm bullish on academia.\n\n1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:34.180\n You need up and coming schools\n\n1:24:34.180 --> 1:24:36.300\n that end up better than where they started off.\n\n1:24:36.300 --> 1:24:38.420\n And MIT was once one of them.\n\n1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:39.260\n Yes.\n\n1:24:39.260 --> 1:24:40.500\n Now they're not in every area.\n\n1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:42.580\n In some areas, they have become the problem.\n\n1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:43.420\n Yep.\n\n1:24:43.420 --> 1:24:45.220\n UChicago, you wouldn't call it up and coming,\n\n1:24:45.220 --> 1:24:46.300\n but it's still different.\n\n1:24:46.300 --> 1:24:47.140\n And that's great.\n\n1:24:47.140 --> 1:24:49.820\n Let's hope they manage to keep it that way.\n\n1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:55.260\n The biggest problem to me is the rank absurd conformism.\n\n1:24:55.260 --> 1:24:57.060\n I kind of second tier schools,\n\n1:24:57.060 --> 1:24:59.900\n maybe in the top 40, but not in the top dozen,\n\n1:24:59.900 --> 1:25:02.620\n that are just trying to be like a junior MIT,\n\n1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:04.820\n but it's mediocre and copycat.\n\n1:25:04.820 --> 1:25:07.340\n And they're the most dogmatic enforcers of weirdness\n\n1:25:07.340 --> 1:25:09.580\n that like Harvard is more open\n\n1:25:09.580 --> 1:25:11.340\n than those second tier schools.\n\n1:25:11.340 --> 1:25:12.580\n And those second tier schools\n\n1:25:12.580 --> 1:25:13.980\n are pretty good typically, right?\n\n1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:14.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:14.820 --> 1:25:17.340\n But the mediocrity is enforced there.\n\n1:25:17.340 --> 1:25:18.180\n Correct.\n\n1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:19.460\n Very strictly.\n\n1:25:19.460 --> 1:25:21.220\n And the homogenization pressures.\n\n1:25:21.220 --> 1:25:24.460\n Climb the rankings by another three places\n\n1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:25.860\n and be a little closer to MIT,\n\n1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:27.260\n though you'll never touch them.\n\n1:25:27.260 --> 1:25:28.740\n That to me is very harmful.\n\n1:25:28.740 --> 1:25:30.900\n And you'd rather they be more like Chicago,\n\n1:25:30.900 --> 1:25:33.940\n more like Caltech, or the older Caltech all the more,\n\n1:25:33.940 --> 1:25:37.380\n like pick some model, be weird in it.\n\n1:25:37.380 --> 1:25:38.900\n You might fail.\n\n1:25:38.900 --> 1:25:40.580\n That's socially better.\n\n1:25:40.580 --> 1:25:43.660\n Yeah, but so the problem with MIT, for example,\n\n1:25:43.660 --> 1:25:48.660\n is the mediocrity is really enforced on the junior faculty.\n\n1:25:49.300 --> 1:25:50.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:50.140 --> 1:25:52.620\n So like the people that are allowed to be weird,\n\n1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:54.900\n or actually they just don't even ask for permissions anymore\n\n1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:56.340\n are more senior faculty.\n\n1:25:56.340 --> 1:25:57.780\n And that's good, of course,\n\n1:25:57.780 --> 1:26:00.300\n but you want the weird young people.\n\n1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:05.300\n I find too, this podcast, I like talking to tech people,\n\n1:26:06.220 --> 1:26:08.740\n and I find the young faculty to be really boring.\n\n1:26:08.740 --> 1:26:09.580\n They are.\n\n1:26:09.580 --> 1:26:11.100\n They're the most boring of faculty.\n\n1:26:11.100 --> 1:26:13.740\n Their work is interesting technically,\n\n1:26:13.740 --> 1:26:18.100\n technically, but just the passion.\n\n1:26:18.100 --> 1:26:19.340\n They are drudges.\n\n1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:23.380\n And some of them sneak by.\n\n1:26:23.380 --> 1:26:24.980\n Like you have like the Max Tegmark,\n\n1:26:24.980 --> 1:26:26.420\n young version of Max Tegmark,\n\n1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:31.420\n who knows how to play the role of boring and fitting in.\n\n1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:34.380\n And then on the side, he does the weird shit.\n\n1:26:34.380 --> 1:26:35.380\n Sure.\n\n1:26:35.380 --> 1:26:37.380\n But they're far and few in between,\n\n1:26:37.380 --> 1:26:41.460\n which I'd love to figure out a way to shake up that system\n\n1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:45.140\n because as you look at MIT's Broad Institute, right,\n\n1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:47.300\n in biomedical, it's been a huge hit.\n\n1:26:47.300 --> 1:26:49.420\n I'm not privy to their internal doings,\n\n1:26:49.420 --> 1:26:52.460\n but I suspect they support weird\n\n1:26:52.460 --> 1:26:55.340\n more than the formal departments do at the junior level.\n\n1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:56.500\n Yes, that's probably true.\n\n1:26:56.500 --> 1:26:58.940\n Yeah, I don't know what, whatever they're doing,\n\n1:26:58.940 --> 1:27:03.580\n it's working, but we needed to figure it out\n\n1:27:03.580 --> 1:27:06.700\n because I think the best ideas still do come from the,\n\n1:27:07.660 --> 1:27:10.140\n so forget, my apologies,\n\n1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:11.660\n but for the humanities side of things,\n\n1:27:11.660 --> 1:27:12.820\n I don't know anything about,\n\n1:27:12.820 --> 1:27:15.660\n but the engineering and the science side,\n\n1:27:15.660 --> 1:27:17.740\n I think there's so many amazing ideas\n\n1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:19.780\n that are still coming from universities.\n\n1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:21.220\n It's not true that you don't know anything\n\n1:27:21.220 --> 1:27:22.060\n about the humanities.\n\n1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:24.460\n You're doing the humanities right now.\n\n1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:25.740\n Talking about people,\n\n1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:28.340\n there are no numbers put on a blackboard, right?\n\n1:27:28.340 --> 1:27:30.260\n There's no hypothesis testing per se.\n\n1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:31.100\n No, yeah.\n\n1:27:31.100 --> 1:27:34.580\n You have however many subscribers to your podcast,\n\n1:27:34.580 --> 1:27:37.060\n all listening to you on the humanities.\n\n1:27:37.060 --> 1:27:38.820\n Every, whatever your frequency is.\n\n1:27:38.820 --> 1:27:40.940\n But I'm not in the department of the humanities.\n\n1:27:40.940 --> 1:27:42.420\n That's why it's innovative.\n\n1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:44.900\n They have very different conversations.\n\n1:27:44.900 --> 1:27:48.180\n There's the number of emails I get about,\n\n1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:51.860\n listen, I really deeply respect diversity\n\n1:27:51.860 --> 1:27:56.220\n and the full scope of what diversity means\n\n1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:58.380\n and also the more narrow scope of different races\n\n1:27:58.380 --> 1:27:59.380\n and genders and so on.\n\n1:27:59.380 --> 1:28:01.020\n It's a really important topic,\n\n1:28:01.020 --> 1:28:03.100\n but there's a disproportionate number of emails\n\n1:28:03.100 --> 1:28:05.980\n I'm getting about meetings and discussions\n\n1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:08.540\n and that just kind of is overwhelming.\n\n1:28:08.540 --> 1:28:10.860\n I don't get enough emails from people,\n\n1:28:10.860 --> 1:28:15.980\n like a meeting about why are all your ideas bad?\n\n1:28:15.980 --> 1:28:18.820\n Let's, for example, let me call out MIT.\n\n1:28:18.820 --> 1:28:20.360\n Why don't we do more?\n\n1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:24.280\n Why don't we kick Stanford's ass or Google's ass,\n\n1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.600\n more importantly, in deep learning and machine learning\n\n1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:28.240\n and AI research?\n\n1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:31.600\n What CSAIL, for example, used to be a laboratory\n\n1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:35.080\n is a laboratory for artificial intelligence research.\n\n1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:40.080\n And why is that not the beacon of greatness\n\n1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:43.760\n in artificial intelligence?\n\n1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:45.720\n Let's have those meetings as well.\n\n1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:48.920\n Diversity talk has oddly become this new mechanism\n\n1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.440\n for enforcing conformity.\n\n1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:51.280\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:54.320\n And right, so it's almost like this conformity mechanism\n\n1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:56.800\n finds the hot new topic to use\n\n1:28:56.800 --> 1:28:58.200\n to enforce further conformity.\n\n1:28:58.200 --> 1:28:59.680\n Exactly.\n\n1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:03.480\n Oh boy, I still, I remain optimistic.\n\n1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:05.600\n The humanities have innovated through podcasts,\n\n1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:08.680\n including yours and mine, and they're alive and well.\n\n1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:12.520\n All the bad talk you hear about the humanities\n\n1:29:12.520 --> 1:29:15.120\n in universities, there's been this huge end run\n\n1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:17.640\n of innovation on the internet and it's amazing.\n\n1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:18.480\n You're right.\n\n1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.680\n I never thought of, I mean, this is humanities.\n\n1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:23.400\n This podcast is right.\n\n1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:25.040\n It's like you've been speaking prose all one's life\n\n1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:26.440\n and didn't know it, right?\n\n1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:31.000\n Yeah, I am actually part of the humanities department\n\n1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:31.840\n at MIT now.\n\n1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:35.000\n I did not realize this and I will fully embrace it\n\n1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.080\n from this moment on.\n\n1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:37.560\n Look, you have this thing, the Media Lab.\n\n1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:39.040\n I'm sure you know about it.\n\n1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:42.400\n Done some excellent things, done a lot of very bogus things,\n\n1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:43.680\n but you're out competing them.\n\n1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:44.960\n You're blowing them out of the water.\n\n1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:45.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:46.880\n Like you are them.\n\n1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:48.480\n Yeah, I mean, and I'm talking to those folks\n\n1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:50.440\n and they're just trying to, well,\n\n1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:51.480\n they're just trying to figure it out.\n\n1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.920\n I mean, they had their issues with Jeff Epstein and so on,\n\n1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:57.840\n but outside of that, there's a,\n\n1:29:57.840 --> 1:29:59.960\n I've actually gone through a shift\n\n1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:02.240\n with this particular podcast, for example,\n\n1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:06.240\n where at first it was seen as a,\n\n1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:09.560\n one, at the very first it was seen as a distraction.\n\n1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:12.000\n Second, it was a source of like,\n\n1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:13.720\n almost like a kind of jealousy,\n\n1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:15.280\n like the same kind of jealousy you feel\n\n1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:18.960\n when junior faculty outshines the senior faculty.\n\n1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:22.240\n And now it's more like, oh, okay, this is a thing.\n\n1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:23.800\n Like we should do more of that.\n\n1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:25.200\n We should embrace this guy.\n\n1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:26.880\n We should embrace this thing.\n\n1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:30.680\n So there's a sense that podcasting and whatever this is,\n\n1:30:30.680 --> 1:30:32.760\n it doesn't have to be podcasting,\n\n1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:35.440\n will drive some innovation within MIT,\n\n1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:37.560\n within different universities.\n\n1:30:37.560 --> 1:30:39.160\n There's a sense that things are changing.\n\n1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:41.800\n It's just that universities lag behind.\n\n1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:45.760\n And my hope is that they catch up quickly.\n\n1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:49.520\n They innovate in some way that goes along\n\n1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:51.840\n with the innovations of the internet.\n\n1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:52.680\n Online.\n\n1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:53.520\n I think the internet will outrace them\n\n1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:55.720\n for a long time, maybe forever.\n\n1:30:55.720 --> 1:30:57.640\n Well, I mean, but it's okay if they're,\n\n1:30:57.640 --> 1:30:58.600\n as long as they're keeping.\n\n1:30:58.600 --> 1:31:00.160\n Yeah, and we're both in universities.\n\n1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:02.680\n So we have multiple hats on here as we're speaking.\n\n1:31:02.680 --> 1:31:05.760\n So we can complain about the universities,\n\n1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:08.760\n but that's like complaining about the podcast, right?\n\n1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:09.600\n We be them.\n\n1:31:09.600 --> 1:31:12.440\n But speaking on the weird,\n\n1:31:12.440 --> 1:31:16.400\n you've in the best sense of the word weird,\n\n1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:18.520\n you've written about and made the case\n\n1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:22.280\n that we should take UFO sightings more seriously.\n\n1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:27.280\n So that's one of the things that I've been inundated with,\n\n1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:34.920\n sort of the excitement and the passion that people have\n\n1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:39.200\n for the possibility of extraterrestrial life,\n\n1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:40.720\n of life out there in the universe.\n\n1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.440\n I've always felt this excitement.\n\n1:31:42.440 --> 1:31:43.760\n I was just looking up at the stars\n\n1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:46.160\n and wondering what the hell's out there.\n\n1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:48.840\n But there's people that have more like,\n\n1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:52.160\n more grounded excitement and passion\n\n1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:55.080\n of actually interacting with aliens\n\n1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:57.880\n on this here, our planet.\n\n1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:01.240\n What's the case from your perspective\n\n1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:05.020\n for taking these sightings more seriously?\n\n1:32:05.020 --> 1:32:09.020\n The data from the Navy, to me, seem quite serious.\n\n1:32:09.020 --> 1:32:11.580\n I don't pretend that I have the technical abilities\n\n1:32:11.580 --> 1:32:13.940\n to judge it as data,\n\n1:32:13.940 --> 1:32:16.100\n but there are numerous senators\n\n1:32:16.100 --> 1:32:18.220\n at the very highest of levels,\n\n1:32:18.220 --> 1:32:20.180\n former heads of CIA, Brennan.\n\n1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:22.540\n I talked to him, did an interview with him.\n\n1:32:22.540 --> 1:32:24.580\n I asked him, what's up with these?\n\n1:32:24.580 --> 1:32:25.420\n What do you think it is?\n\n1:32:25.420 --> 1:32:28.740\n He basically said that was the single most likely explanation\n\n1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:30.020\n was of alien origin.\n\n1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:32.340\n Now you don't have to agree with him.\n\n1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:35.180\n But look, if you know how government works, these senators,\n\n1:32:35.180 --> 1:32:37.700\n or Hillary Clinton, for that matter, or Brennan,\n\n1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:40.380\n they sat down, they were briefed by their smartest people,\n\n1:32:40.380 --> 1:32:43.900\n and they said, hey, what's going on here?\n\n1:32:43.900 --> 1:32:45.580\n And everyone around the table, I believe,\n\n1:32:45.580 --> 1:32:48.180\n is telling them, we don't know.\n\n1:32:48.180 --> 1:32:52.660\n And that is sociological data I take very seriously.\n\n1:32:52.660 --> 1:32:56.460\n I have not seen a debunking of the technical data,\n\n1:32:56.460 --> 1:32:59.060\n which is eyewitness reports and images and radar.\n\n1:32:59.060 --> 1:33:02.020\n Again, I don't pretend that I have the technical abilities\n\n1:33:02.020 --> 1:33:03.860\n or again, at a technical level,\n\n1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:06.660\n I feel quite uncertain on that turf.\n\n1:33:06.660 --> 1:33:10.020\n But evaluating through the testimony of witnesses,\n\n1:33:10.020 --> 1:33:12.660\n it seems to me it's now at a threshold\n\n1:33:12.660 --> 1:33:15.140\n where one ought to take it seriously.\n\n1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:18.500\n Yeah, one of the problems with UFO sightings\n\n1:33:18.500 --> 1:33:21.020\n is that because of people with good equipment\n\n1:33:21.940 --> 1:33:25.140\n don't take it seriously, it's such a taboo topic,\n\n1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:28.100\n that you have just like really shitty equipment\n\n1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:28.940\n collecting data.\n\n1:33:28.940 --> 1:33:32.460\n And so you have the blurry Bigfoot kind of situation\n\n1:33:32.460 --> 1:33:35.700\n where you have just bad video and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:33:35.700 --> 1:33:40.180\n As opposed to, I mean, there's a bunch of people,\n\n1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:44.860\n Avi Lo from Harvard talking about Oumuamua.\n\n1:33:44.860 --> 1:33:49.660\n It's just like people with the equipment\n\n1:33:49.660 --> 1:33:54.220\n to do the data collection don't want to help out.\n\n1:33:54.220 --> 1:33:57.820\n And that creates a kind of divide\n\n1:33:57.820 --> 1:34:00.740\n where the scientists ignore that this is happening\n\n1:34:00.740 --> 1:34:04.100\n and there's the masses of people who are curious about it.\n\n1:34:04.100 --> 1:34:07.020\n And then there's the government that's full of secrets\n\n1:34:07.020 --> 1:34:10.780\n that's leaking some confusion\n\n1:34:10.780 --> 1:34:12.820\n and it creates distrust in the government,\n\n1:34:12.820 --> 1:34:15.260\n it creates distrust in science\n\n1:34:15.260 --> 1:34:16.980\n and it prevents the scientists\n\n1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:19.860\n from being able to explore some cool topics,\n\n1:34:19.860 --> 1:34:22.780\n some exciting possibilities that they should be,\n\n1:34:22.780 --> 1:34:25.340\n be curious kids like Avi talks about.\n\n1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:28.540\n Even if it has nothing to do with aliens,\n\n1:34:28.540 --> 1:34:31.220\n whatever the answer is, it has to be something fascinating.\n\n1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:32.620\n We already know everything's interesting,\n\n1:34:32.620 --> 1:34:33.820\n but this is fascinating.\n\n1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:37.020\n But look, that all said,\n\n1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:39.060\n I suspect they're not of alien origin.\n\n1:34:39.060 --> 1:34:40.380\n And let me tell you my reason.\n\n1:34:40.380 --> 1:34:43.220\n The people who are all gung ho,\n\n1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:45.220\n they do a kind of reasoning in reverse\n\n1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:46.780\n or argument from elimination.\n\n1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:49.900\n They figure out a bunch of things that can't be,\n\n1:34:49.900 --> 1:34:52.340\n like is it a Russian advanced vehicle?\n\n1:34:52.340 --> 1:34:54.580\n No, probably pretty good arguments there.\n\n1:34:54.580 --> 1:34:56.340\n Is it a Chinese advanced vehicle?\n\n1:34:56.340 --> 1:34:57.300\n No.\n\n1:34:57.300 --> 1:35:00.180\n Is it people like from the earth's future\n\n1:35:00.180 --> 1:35:01.500\n coming back in time?\n\n1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:02.340\n No.\n\n1:35:02.340 --> 1:35:03.620\n And they go through a few others.\n\n1:35:03.620 --> 1:35:05.020\n They have some really good no arguments.\n\n1:35:05.020 --> 1:35:07.980\n Then they're like, well, what we've got left is aliens.\n\n1:35:07.980 --> 1:35:09.700\n This argument from elimination,\n\n1:35:09.700 --> 1:35:12.500\n I don't actually find that persuasive.\n\n1:35:12.500 --> 1:35:16.060\n You can talk yourself into a lot of mistaken ideas that way.\n\n1:35:16.060 --> 1:35:20.500\n The positive evidence that it's aliens is still quite weak.\n\n1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:24.100\n The positive evidence that it's a puzzle is quite huge.\n\n1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:27.180\n And whatever the solution to the puzzle is,\n\n1:35:27.180 --> 1:35:28.500\n it might be fascinating.\n\n1:35:28.500 --> 1:35:30.580\n And it's gonna be so weird or fascinating\n\n1:35:30.580 --> 1:35:33.540\n or maybe even trivial, but that's weird in its own way,\n\n1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:37.060\n that we can't set up by elimination\n\n1:35:37.060 --> 1:35:38.700\n all the things that might be able to be.\n\n1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:39.980\n Yeah, and just like you said,\n\n1:35:39.980 --> 1:35:43.820\n the debunking that I've seen of these kinds of things\n\n1:35:43.820 --> 1:35:48.820\n are less explorations and solutions to the puzzle\n\n1:35:49.380 --> 1:35:52.820\n and more a kind of halfhearted dismissal.\n\n1:35:52.820 --> 1:35:56.620\n And Avi, as you mentioned to him on your podcast with him,\n\n1:35:56.620 --> 1:35:58.820\n he's been attacked an awful lot.\n\n1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:01.300\n And when I hear the idea carrier attacked,\n\n1:36:01.300 --> 1:36:03.180\n I get very suspicious of the critics.\n\n1:36:04.620 --> 1:36:07.220\n If he's wrong, like just tell me why.\n\n1:36:07.220 --> 1:36:08.940\n Like my ears are open.\n\n1:36:08.940 --> 1:36:12.460\n I don't have a set view on Oumuamua, you know.\n\n1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:14.460\n I know I can't judge Avi's arguments.\n\n1:36:14.460 --> 1:36:15.980\n He can't convince me in that sense.\n\n1:36:15.980 --> 1:36:18.180\n I'm too stupid to understand\n\n1:36:18.180 --> 1:36:20.740\n how good his argument may or may not be.\n\n1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:23.140\n And like you said, ultimately,\n\n1:36:23.140 --> 1:36:27.980\n in the argument, in the meeting of that debate\n\n1:36:27.980 --> 1:36:30.580\n is where we find the wisdom.\n\n1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:32.180\n Like dismissing it, there's one other thing\n\n1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:33.020\n that troubles me.\n\n1:36:33.020 --> 1:36:33.860\n There's a bunch of people,\n\n1:36:33.860 --> 1:36:35.500\n like Nietzsche sometimes dismiss this way.\n\n1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:38.100\n Ayn Rand is sometimes dismissed this way.\n\n1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:38.940\n Oh, here we go.\n\n1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:43.100\n Like there's a, as opposed to arguing against her ideas,\n\n1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:44.900\n dismissing it outright.\n\n1:36:44.900 --> 1:36:48.340\n And that's not productive at all.\n\n1:36:48.340 --> 1:36:49.780\n She may be wrong on a lot of things,\n\n1:36:49.780 --> 1:36:52.900\n but like laying out some arguments,\n\n1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:54.820\n even if they're basic human arguments,\n\n1:36:55.740 --> 1:36:57.980\n that's where we arrive at the wisdom.\n\n1:36:57.980 --> 1:36:58.820\n I love that.\n\n1:36:59.820 --> 1:37:03.300\n Is there something deeper to be said\n\n1:37:03.300 --> 1:37:06.740\n about our trust in institutions and governments and so on\n\n1:37:06.740 --> 1:37:08.940\n that has to do with UFOs?\n\n1:37:08.940 --> 1:37:10.980\n That there's a kind of suspicion\n\n1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:13.580\n that the US government and governments in general\n\n1:37:13.580 --> 1:37:17.340\n are hiding stuff from us when you talk about UFOs.\n\n1:37:17.340 --> 1:37:18.900\n This is my view on that.\n\n1:37:18.900 --> 1:37:20.940\n If we declassified everything,\n\n1:37:20.940 --> 1:37:22.900\n I think we would find a lot more evidence\n\n1:37:22.900 --> 1:37:25.260\n all pointing toward the same puzzle.\n\n1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:28.180\n There aren't some alien men being held underground.\n\n1:37:28.180 --> 1:37:30.100\n There's not some secret file that lays out\n\n1:37:30.100 --> 1:37:31.300\n whatever is happening.\n\n1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:34.420\n I think the real lesson about government\n\n1:37:34.420 --> 1:37:38.460\n is government cannot bring itself to any new belief\n\n1:37:38.460 --> 1:37:40.580\n on this matter of any kind.\n\n1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:42.300\n And it's a kind of funny inertia.\n\n1:37:42.300 --> 1:37:44.300\n Like government is deeply puzzled.\n\n1:37:44.300 --> 1:37:46.540\n They're more puzzled than they want to admit to us,\n\n1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:49.740\n which I'm okay with that, actually.\n\n1:37:49.740 --> 1:37:53.140\n They shouldn't just be out panicking people in the streets.\n\n1:37:53.140 --> 1:37:54.180\n But at the end of the day,\n\n1:37:54.180 --> 1:37:57.220\n it's a bit like approving the AstraZeneca vaccine,\n\n1:37:57.220 --> 1:37:59.060\n which does work and they haven't approved it.\n\n1:37:59.060 --> 1:38:00.380\n When are they gonna do it?\n\n1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:05.380\n When is our government actually, if only internally,\n\n1:38:06.140 --> 1:38:08.220\n gonna take this more than just seriously,\n\n1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:10.380\n but take it truly seriously?\n\n1:38:10.380 --> 1:38:13.060\n And I just don't know if we have that capability,\n\n1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:15.820\n kind of mentally, to sound like Eric Weinstein\n\n1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:17.500\n for another moment.\n\n1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:21.620\n And to stay on the same topic,\n\n1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:23.820\n although on the surface shifting completely,\n\n1:38:25.100 --> 1:38:26.980\n because it is all the same topic.\n\n1:38:26.980 --> 1:38:29.620\n You have written and studied art.\n\n1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:34.620\n Why do you think we humans long to create art,\n\n1:38:34.740 --> 1:38:38.020\n human society in general and just the human mind?\n\n1:38:38.020 --> 1:38:41.180\n Well, most of us don't really long to create art, right?\n\n1:38:41.180 --> 1:38:42.940\n I would start with that point.\n\n1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:45.100\n You think so?\n\n1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:47.740\n You think that's a unique weirdness\n\n1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:49.940\n of some particular humans?\n\n1:38:49.940 --> 1:38:52.900\n I think, I don't know, 10% of humans roughly,\n\n1:38:52.900 --> 1:38:55.820\n which is a lot, but it is somewhat weird.\n\n1:38:56.780 --> 1:38:58.860\n I don't aspire to create art.\n\n1:38:58.860 --> 1:39:01.660\n You could say, like writing nonfiction,\n\n1:39:01.660 --> 1:39:03.460\n there's something art like about it,\n\n1:39:03.460 --> 1:39:05.700\n but it's a different urge, I would say.\n\n1:39:07.980 --> 1:39:10.780\n So why do some people have it?\n\n1:39:10.780 --> 1:39:13.180\n I think human brains are very different.\n\n1:39:13.180 --> 1:39:16.260\n It's a different notion of working through a problem.\n\n1:39:16.260 --> 1:39:20.220\n Like you and I enjoy working through analytic problems.\n\n1:39:20.220 --> 1:39:22.620\n For me, economics, for you, AI and other areas,\n\n1:39:22.620 --> 1:39:26.860\n or your humanities podcast, but that's fun.\n\n1:39:26.860 --> 1:39:29.260\n For that problem to be visual\n\n1:39:29.260 --> 1:39:31.220\n and linked to physical materials\n\n1:39:31.220 --> 1:39:33.140\n and putting those like on a canvas,\n\n1:39:34.300 --> 1:39:36.260\n to me, it's not a huge leap,\n\n1:39:36.260 --> 1:39:38.740\n but I really don't wanna do it.\n\n1:39:38.740 --> 1:39:40.100\n Like it would be pain.\n\n1:39:40.100 --> 1:39:45.100\n If you paid me like 500 bucks to spend an hour painting,\n\n1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:48.140\n I don't know, is that worth it?\n\n1:39:48.140 --> 1:39:51.380\n Maybe, but like, I'm happy when that hour's over.\n\n1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:55.540\n And would not be proud or happy with the result.\n\n1:39:55.540 --> 1:39:57.140\n It would suck.\n\n1:39:57.140 --> 1:39:59.740\n I don't think I would do it actually.\n\n1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:02.940\n Do you think you're suppressing some deep, I mean?\n\n1:40:02.940 --> 1:40:03.860\n Absolutely not.\n\n1:40:03.860 --> 1:40:06.780\n Now, when I was young, I played the guitar\n\n1:40:06.780 --> 1:40:09.020\n as you played the guitar and that I greatly enjoyed,\n\n1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:11.060\n although I was never good,\n\n1:40:11.060 --> 1:40:14.380\n but it helped me appreciate music much, much more.\n\n1:40:14.380 --> 1:40:15.220\n Well, this is the question.\n\n1:40:15.220 --> 1:40:17.020\n Okay, so from the perspective of the observer\n\n1:40:17.020 --> 1:40:20.300\n and appreciator of art, you said good.\n\n1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:23.500\n Is there such a concept as good in art?\n\n1:40:23.500 --> 1:40:25.860\n There's clearly a concept of bad.\n\n1:40:25.860 --> 1:40:27.940\n My guitar playing fit that concept.\n\n1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:29.940\n Okay.\n\n1:40:29.940 --> 1:40:30.780\n But I wasn't trying to be good.\n\n1:40:30.780 --> 1:40:33.100\n I wanted to learn like how do chords work?\n\n1:40:33.100 --> 1:40:33.940\n Okay, analytical.\n\n1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:35.620\n How does a jazz improvisation work?\n\n1:40:35.620 --> 1:40:37.340\n How is blues different?\n\n1:40:37.340 --> 1:40:39.380\n Classical guitar, sort of physically,\n\n1:40:39.380 --> 1:40:41.100\n how do you make those sounds?\n\n1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:42.340\n And I did learn those things.\n\n1:40:42.340 --> 1:40:44.780\n And you can't learn everything about them,\n\n1:40:44.780 --> 1:40:47.100\n but you can learn a lot about them without ever being good\n\n1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:48.700\n or even trying to be that good.\n\n1:40:48.700 --> 1:40:51.020\n But I could play all the notes.\n\n1:40:51.020 --> 1:40:53.140\n So from the observer perspective,\n\n1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:56.980\n what do you, I apologize for the absurd question,\n\n1:40:56.980 --> 1:40:58.740\n but what do you use the most beautiful\n\n1:40:58.740 --> 1:41:02.140\n and maybe moving piece of art you've encountered\n\n1:41:02.140 --> 1:41:02.980\n in your life?\n\n1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:05.780\n It's not an absurd question at all.\n\n1:41:05.780 --> 1:41:07.540\n And I think about this quite a bit.\n\n1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:13.060\n I would say the two winners by a clear margin\n\n1:41:13.060 --> 1:41:15.140\n are both by Michelangelo.\n\n1:41:15.140 --> 1:41:17.620\n It's the Pieta in the Vatican\n\n1:41:17.620 --> 1:41:20.780\n and the David statue in Florence.\n\n1:41:20.780 --> 1:41:21.620\n Why?\n\n1:41:21.620 --> 1:41:25.340\n Historical context or just purity, the creation itself?\n\n1:41:25.340 --> 1:41:28.060\n I don't think you can view it apart from historical context\n\n1:41:28.060 --> 1:41:30.820\n and being in Florence or in the Vatican,\n\n1:41:30.820 --> 1:41:32.780\n you're already primed for a lot, right?\n\n1:41:32.780 --> 1:41:35.460\n You can't pull that out.\n\n1:41:35.460 --> 1:41:37.780\n But just technically how they express\n\n1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:40.060\n the emotion of human form,\n\n1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:42.180\n I do honestly intellectually think\n\n1:41:42.180 --> 1:41:45.220\n they're the two greatest artworks for doing that.\n\n1:41:45.220 --> 1:41:46.500\n That's not all that art does.\n\n1:41:46.500 --> 1:41:48.620\n Not all art is about the human form,\n\n1:41:48.620 --> 1:41:50.020\n but they are phenomenal.\n\n1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:54.300\n And I think critical opinion, not that everyone agrees,\n\n1:41:54.300 --> 1:41:57.300\n but my view is not considered a crazy one\n\n1:41:57.300 --> 1:41:58.940\n within the broader court of critical opinion.\n\n1:41:58.940 --> 1:42:02.820\n Now in painting, I think the most I was ever blown away\n\n1:42:02.820 --> 1:42:05.420\n was to see Vermeer's artwork.\n\n1:42:05.420 --> 1:42:09.020\n It's called The Art of Painting and it's in Vienna\n\n1:42:09.020 --> 1:42:11.300\n in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.\n\n1:42:11.300 --> 1:42:13.340\n And I saw that, I think I was 23.\n\n1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:17.940\n It just stunned me because I'd seen reproductions,\n\n1:42:17.940 --> 1:42:19.540\n but live in front of you in huge,\n\n1:42:19.540 --> 1:42:21.020\n a completely different artwork.\n\n1:42:21.020 --> 1:42:23.460\n And again, Vienna, primed.\n\n1:42:23.460 --> 1:42:26.820\n Yes, and I was living abroad for the first time\n\n1:42:26.820 --> 1:42:28.740\n and Vienna itself, the city and so on.\n\n1:42:28.740 --> 1:42:30.300\n Now, unlike the Michelangelo's,\n\n1:42:30.300 --> 1:42:33.060\n that is not my current favorite painting,\n\n1:42:33.060 --> 1:42:35.500\n but that would be like historically the one I would pick.\n\n1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:38.060\n What do you make in the context of those choices?\n\n1:42:38.060 --> 1:42:39.700\n What do you make of modern art?\n\n1:42:39.700 --> 1:42:44.660\n And I apologize if I'm not using the correct terminology,\n\n1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:49.660\n but art that maybe goes another level of weird\n\n1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:52.940\n outside of the art that you've kind of mentioned\n\n1:42:52.940 --> 1:42:55.700\n and breaks all the conventions and rules and so on\n\n1:42:55.700 --> 1:42:59.420\n and becomes something else entirely\n\n1:42:59.420 --> 1:43:02.620\n that doesn't make sense in the same way\n\n1:43:02.620 --> 1:43:03.860\n that David might.\n\n1:43:03.860 --> 1:43:05.660\n I think a lot of it is phenomenal.\n\n1:43:05.660 --> 1:43:07.740\n And I would say the single biggest mistake\n\n1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:12.300\n that really smart people make is to think contemporary art\n\n1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:15.980\n or music for that matter is just a load of junk or rubbish.\n\n1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:17.580\n It's just like a kind of mathematics\n\n1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:18.780\n they haven't learned yet.\n\n1:43:18.780 --> 1:43:20.620\n It's really hard to learn.\n\n1:43:20.620 --> 1:43:23.260\n Maybe some people can never learn it,\n\n1:43:23.260 --> 1:43:26.220\n but there's a very large community of super smart,\n\n1:43:26.220 --> 1:43:28.820\n well educated people who spend their lives with it,\n\n1:43:28.820 --> 1:43:29.700\n who love it.\n\n1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:30.900\n Those are genuine pleasures.\n\n1:43:30.900 --> 1:43:31.740\n They understand it.\n\n1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:34.260\n They talk about it with the common language.\n\n1:43:34.260 --> 1:43:36.100\n And to think that somehow they're all frauds,\n\n1:43:36.100 --> 1:43:37.500\n it just isn't true.\n\n1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:40.100\n Like one doesn't have to like it oneself,\n\n1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:42.340\n just like Love House may or may not be your thing,\n\n1:43:42.340 --> 1:43:45.820\n but it is amazing and for me personally, highly rewarding.\n\n1:43:45.820 --> 1:43:47.980\n And if someone doesn't get it,\n\n1:43:47.980 --> 1:43:50.420\n I do kind of have the conceited response of thinking\n\n1:43:50.420 --> 1:43:54.060\n like in that area, I'm just smarter than you are.\n\n1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:56.860\n Yeah, so the interesting thing is as with most...\n\n1:43:56.860 --> 1:43:58.580\n We get back to Eric Weinstein again.\n\n1:43:58.580 --> 1:43:59.420\n Yes.\n\n1:43:59.420 --> 1:44:02.180\n He's in general smarter than I am, this I get.\n\n1:44:02.180 --> 1:44:05.060\n But when it comes to contemporary artistic creations,\n\n1:44:05.060 --> 1:44:06.700\n I'm smarter than he is.\n\n1:44:06.700 --> 1:44:08.780\n So he's not a fan of contemporary art?\n\n1:44:08.780 --> 1:44:10.180\n I don't want to speak for him.\n\n1:44:10.180 --> 1:44:11.500\n I've heard him say derogatory...\n\n1:44:11.500 --> 1:44:12.660\n He's evolving always.\n\n1:44:12.660 --> 1:44:13.780\n He's evolving always.\n\n1:44:13.780 --> 1:44:16.180\n I've heard him say derogatory things about some of it.\n\n1:44:16.180 --> 1:44:18.740\n Doesn't mean he doesn't love some other parts of it.\n\n1:44:18.740 --> 1:44:22.340\n So I wonder if there's just a higher learning curve,\n\n1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:24.820\n a steeper learning curve for contemporary art,\n\n1:44:24.820 --> 1:44:28.660\n meaning like it takes more work to appreciate the stories,\n\n1:44:28.660 --> 1:44:32.420\n the context from which they're like thinking about this work.\n\n1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:36.180\n It feels like in order to appreciate the art contemporary,\n\n1:44:36.180 --> 1:44:37.660\n certain pieces of contemporary art,\n\n1:44:37.660 --> 1:44:41.260\n you have to know the story better behind the art.\n\n1:44:41.260 --> 1:44:42.860\n I think that's true for many people,\n\n1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:45.420\n but I think it's a funny shape distribution\n\n1:44:45.420 --> 1:44:47.780\n because there's a whole other set of people.\n\n1:44:47.780 --> 1:44:49.460\n Sometimes they're small children\n\n1:44:49.460 --> 1:44:51.740\n and they get abstract art more easily.\n\n1:44:51.740 --> 1:44:56.380\n You show them Vermeer or Rembrandt, they don't get it.\n\n1:44:56.380 --> 1:45:00.340\n But just like a wall of color, they're in love with it.\n\n1:45:00.340 --> 1:45:03.100\n So I don't think I know the full story.\n\n1:45:03.100 --> 1:45:04.740\n Again, some strange kind of distribution.\n\n1:45:04.740 --> 1:45:07.820\n The entry barriers are super high or super low,\n\n1:45:07.820 --> 1:45:09.300\n but not that often in between.\n\n1:45:11.100 --> 1:45:12.780\n But you would challenge saying\n\n1:45:12.780 --> 1:45:15.420\n that there's a lot to be explored in contemporary art.\n\n1:45:15.420 --> 1:45:20.420\n It's just you need to learn.\n\n1:45:20.420 --> 1:45:22.380\n Yeah, it's one of the most profound bodies\n\n1:45:22.380 --> 1:45:24.060\n of human thought out there.\n\n1:45:24.060 --> 1:45:26.460\n And it's part of the humanities.\n\n1:45:26.460 --> 1:45:28.540\n And yes, there are people who also don't like podcasts,\n\n1:45:28.540 --> 1:45:29.380\n right?\n\n1:45:30.540 --> 1:45:31.380\n And that's fine.\n\n1:45:31.380 --> 1:45:32.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:32.540 --> 1:45:35.500\n You've also been a scholar of food.\n\n1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:37.060\n We're just going through the entirety\n\n1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:40.020\n of the human experience today on this humanities podcast.\n\n1:45:42.620 --> 1:45:45.460\n Another absurd question, say this conversation\n\n1:45:45.460 --> 1:45:47.100\n is the last thing you ever do in your life.\n\n1:45:47.100 --> 1:45:49.460\n I, wearing the suit, would murder you\n\n1:45:49.460 --> 1:45:50.660\n at the end of the conversation.\n\n1:45:50.660 --> 1:45:52.660\n So this is your last day on earth,\n\n1:45:52.660 --> 1:45:54.540\n but I would offer you a last meal.\n\n1:45:54.540 --> 1:45:57.220\n What would that meal contain?\n\n1:45:57.220 --> 1:45:59.340\n We can also travel to other parts of the world.\n\n1:45:59.340 --> 1:46:00.340\n Well, we have to travel\n\n1:46:00.340 --> 1:46:03.420\n because my preferred last meal here,\n\n1:46:03.420 --> 1:46:05.820\n I probably had like two nights ago.\n\n1:46:05.820 --> 1:46:06.900\n Which is what?\n\n1:46:06.900 --> 1:46:08.580\n Can you describe or no?\n\n1:46:08.580 --> 1:46:11.300\n The best restaurant around here is called Mama Chang's\n\n1:46:11.300 --> 1:46:16.100\n and it's in Fairfax and it's food from Wuhan actually.\n\n1:46:16.100 --> 1:46:18.420\n And they take pandemic safety seriously\n\n1:46:18.420 --> 1:46:20.420\n in addition to the food being very good.\n\n1:46:20.420 --> 1:46:23.060\n But this is what I would do.\n\n1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:27.460\n I would fly to Hermosillo in Northern Mexico,\n\n1:46:27.460 --> 1:46:29.180\n which has some of the best food in Mexico,\n\n1:46:29.180 --> 1:46:31.980\n but I sadly only had two days there.\n\n1:46:31.980 --> 1:46:33.780\n So somewhere like Oaxaca, Puebla,\n\n1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:37.500\n I think they have food just as good\n\n1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:38.820\n or some people would say better,\n\n1:46:38.820 --> 1:46:41.220\n but I've spent a lot of time in those places.\n\n1:46:41.220 --> 1:46:44.340\n So the scarce, wait, is it possible the scarcity of time\n\n1:46:44.340 --> 1:46:46.660\n contributed to the richness of the experience?\n\n1:46:46.660 --> 1:46:50.020\n Of course, but the point is that scarcity still holds.\n\n1:46:50.020 --> 1:46:53.380\n So I want one more dose of the food from Hermosillo.\n\n1:46:53.380 --> 1:46:55.620\n Can you describe what the food is?\n\n1:46:55.620 --> 1:46:58.180\n It's the one kind of Mexican food that at least nominally\n\n1:46:58.180 --> 1:47:00.740\n is just like the Mexican food you get in the US.\n\n1:47:00.740 --> 1:47:02.860\n So there are burritos, there's fajitas.\n\n1:47:02.860 --> 1:47:05.420\n It doesn't taste at all like our stuff.\n\n1:47:05.420 --> 1:47:08.180\n But again, nominally, it's the part of Mexican food\n\n1:47:08.180 --> 1:47:11.380\n that made it into the US was then transformed.\n\n1:47:11.380 --> 1:47:13.300\n But it's in a way the most familiar.\n\n1:47:14.420 --> 1:47:16.220\n But for that reason, it's the most radical\n\n1:47:16.220 --> 1:47:18.700\n because you have to rethink all these things you know\n\n1:47:18.700 --> 1:47:21.140\n and they're way better in Hermosillo.\n\n1:47:21.140 --> 1:47:22.580\n Hardly any tourists go there.\n\n1:47:22.580 --> 1:47:24.860\n Like there's nothing to see in Hermosillo.\n\n1:47:24.860 --> 1:47:26.820\n Nothing you do other than eat.\n\n1:47:26.820 --> 1:47:29.340\n It's not ruined by any outsiders.\n\n1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:33.060\n It's this longstanding tradition, dirt cheap.\n\n1:47:33.060 --> 1:47:36.340\n And the thing to do there is just sweet talk a taxi driver\n\n1:47:36.340 --> 1:47:38.580\n into first taking you seriously\n\n1:47:38.580 --> 1:47:41.900\n and then trusting you enough to know that you trust him\n\n1:47:41.900 --> 1:47:44.820\n to bring you to the very best like food stands.\n\n1:47:44.820 --> 1:47:49.820\n So where's the magic of that nominally similar\n\n1:47:51.900 --> 1:47:53.500\n entity of the burrito?\n\n1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:55.220\n Where's the magic come from?\n\n1:47:55.220 --> 1:47:56.780\n Is it the taxi ride?\n\n1:47:56.780 --> 1:47:57.980\n Is it the whole experience\n\n1:47:57.980 --> 1:47:59.940\n or is there something actually in the food?\n\n1:47:59.940 --> 1:48:02.340\n So well, you can break the food down part by part.\n\n1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:04.020\n So if you think of the beef,\n\n1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:07.500\n the beef there will be dry aged just out in the air\n\n1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:10.660\n in a way the FDA here would never permit.\n\n1:48:10.660 --> 1:48:12.540\n Like they dry age it till it turns green,\n\n1:48:12.540 --> 1:48:14.460\n but it is phenomenal.\n\n1:48:14.460 --> 1:48:16.380\n The quality of the chilies.\n\n1:48:16.380 --> 1:48:17.820\n So here there's only a small number\n\n1:48:17.820 --> 1:48:19.740\n of kinds of chilies you can get.\n\n1:48:19.740 --> 1:48:21.700\n In most parts of Mexico,\n\n1:48:21.700 --> 1:48:24.220\n there's quite a large number of chilies you can get.\n\n1:48:24.220 --> 1:48:26.140\n They're different, they're fresher,\n\n1:48:26.140 --> 1:48:27.980\n but it's just like a different thing.\n\n1:48:27.980 --> 1:48:32.260\n The chilies, the wheat used.\n\n1:48:32.260 --> 1:48:34.740\n So this is wheat territory, not corn territory,\n\n1:48:34.740 --> 1:48:36.140\n which is a self interesting.\n\n1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:39.740\n The wheat is more diverse and more complex.\n\n1:48:39.740 --> 1:48:42.300\n Here it's more homogenized, obviously cheaper,\n\n1:48:42.300 --> 1:48:44.740\n more efficient, but there it is better.\n\n1:48:45.860 --> 1:48:50.220\n Non pasteurized cheeses are legal in all parts of Mexico\n\n1:48:50.220 --> 1:48:52.900\n and they can be white and gooey and amazing\n\n1:48:52.900 --> 1:48:55.660\n in a way that here again, it's just against the law.\n\n1:48:55.660 --> 1:48:56.620\n You could legalize them.\n\n1:48:56.620 --> 1:48:57.780\n The demand wouldn't be that great.\n\n1:48:57.780 --> 1:48:59.300\n There's a black market in these cheeses\n\n1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:01.620\n that Latino groceries around here,\n\n1:49:01.620 --> 1:49:03.420\n but you just can't get that much of it.\n\n1:49:03.420 --> 1:49:05.660\n So the cheese, the meat, the wheat,\n\n1:49:06.660 --> 1:49:09.300\n all different in significant ways.\n\n1:49:09.300 --> 1:49:13.100\n The chilies, I don't think the onions really matter much.\n\n1:49:13.100 --> 1:49:14.060\n Garlic, I don't know.\n\n1:49:14.060 --> 1:49:15.820\n I wouldn't put much stock in that,\n\n1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:18.700\n but that's a lot of the core food\n\n1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:20.020\n and then it's cooked much better\n\n1:49:20.020 --> 1:49:21.460\n and everything's super fresh.\n\n1:49:22.340 --> 1:49:25.300\n The food chain is not relying on refrigeration.\n\n1:49:25.300 --> 1:49:27.740\n And this is one thing Russia and US have in common.\n\n1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:31.540\n We were early pioneers in food refrigeration\n\n1:49:31.540 --> 1:49:34.260\n and that made a lot of our foods worse quite early.\n\n1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:37.260\n And it took us a long time to dig out of that\n\n1:49:37.260 --> 1:49:39.380\n because big countries, right?\n\n1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:42.420\n You've had an extensive rail system in Russia,\n\n1:49:42.420 --> 1:49:45.740\n USSR a long time, which makes it easier to freeze\n\n1:49:45.740 --> 1:49:46.580\n and then ship.\n\n1:49:47.580 --> 1:49:50.580\n What about the actual cooking, the chef?\n\n1:49:50.580 --> 1:49:53.780\n Is there an artistry to the simple?\n\n1:49:53.780 --> 1:49:57.060\n I hesitate to call the burrito simple, but.\n\n1:49:57.060 --> 1:49:58.740\n And there's no brain drain out of cooking.\n\n1:49:58.740 --> 1:50:03.460\n So if you're in the United States and you're very talented,\n\n1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:05.260\n I'm not saying there aren't talented chefs.\n\n1:50:05.260 --> 1:50:06.780\n Of course there are,\n\n1:50:06.780 --> 1:50:09.620\n but there's so many other things to pull people away.\n\n1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:12.300\n But in Mexico, there's so much talent going into food\n\n1:50:12.300 --> 1:50:14.100\n as there is in China,\n\n1:50:14.100 --> 1:50:17.460\n which would be another candidate for last meal questions.\n\n1:50:17.460 --> 1:50:18.500\n Or India.\n\n1:50:18.500 --> 1:50:21.340\n Or, oh, India, let's not even get started on India.\n\n1:50:21.340 --> 1:50:22.180\n Unbelievable.\n\n1:50:23.220 --> 1:50:24.740\n You've also, I mean, there's a million things\n\n1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:25.580\n we could talk about here,\n\n1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:28.700\n but you've written about your own dreams of sushi.\n\n1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:30.620\n It's just a really clean, good example\n\n1:50:30.620 --> 1:50:33.700\n that people are aware of of mastery\n\n1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:38.180\n in the art of the simple in food.\n\n1:50:39.420 --> 1:50:41.460\n What do you make of that kind of obsessive pursuit\n\n1:50:41.460 --> 1:50:45.020\n of perfection in creating simple food?\n\n1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:46.780\n Sushi is about perfection,\n\n1:50:46.780 --> 1:50:48.420\n but it's a bit like the Beatles White album,\n\n1:50:48.420 --> 1:50:51.540\n which people think is simple and not overproduced.\n\n1:50:51.540 --> 1:50:54.340\n It's in a funny way their most overproduced album,\n\n1:50:54.340 --> 1:50:55.980\n but it's produced just perfectly.\n\n1:50:55.980 --> 1:50:57.260\n It sounds simple.\n\n1:50:57.260 --> 1:50:59.860\n It's really hard to produce music to the point\n\n1:50:59.860 --> 1:51:03.140\n where it's gonna sound so simple and not sound like sludge.\n\n1:51:03.140 --> 1:51:06.140\n Like Let It Be album, it has some great songs,\n\n1:51:06.140 --> 1:51:07.700\n but a lot of it sounds like sludge.\n\n1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:09.780\n One After 909, that's sludge.\n\n1:51:09.780 --> 1:51:11.580\n I Dig A Pony, it's sludge.\n\n1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:13.020\n Like it's a bit interesting.\n\n1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:13.860\n It's not that good.\n\n1:51:13.860 --> 1:51:15.740\n It doesn't sound that good.\n\n1:51:15.740 --> 1:51:18.140\n White album, like the best half, like Dear Prudence,\n\n1:51:18.140 --> 1:51:20.020\n sounds perfect, sounds simple.\n\n1:51:20.020 --> 1:51:21.940\n Cry Baby Cry, it's not simple.\n\n1:51:21.940 --> 1:51:25.180\n Back in the USSR, super complex.\n\n1:51:25.180 --> 1:51:26.900\n So sushi is like that.\n\n1:51:26.900 --> 1:51:29.580\n It's because it's so incredibly not simple\n\n1:51:29.580 --> 1:51:31.540\n starting with the rice.\n\n1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:34.420\n You try to refine it to make it appear super simple,\n\n1:51:34.420 --> 1:51:37.020\n and that's the most complex thing of all.\n\n1:51:37.020 --> 1:51:39.300\n So do you admire,\n\n1:51:39.300 --> 1:51:43.900\n I mean, we're not talking about days, weeks, months.\n\n1:51:43.900 --> 1:51:46.540\n We're talking about years, generations\n\n1:51:46.540 --> 1:51:49.260\n of doing the same thing over and over and over again.\n\n1:51:49.260 --> 1:51:51.460\n Do you admire that kind of sticking to the,\n\n1:51:53.020 --> 1:51:56.060\n we talked about our admiration of the weird.\n\n1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:57.540\n That doesn't feel weird.\n\n1:51:57.540 --> 1:52:01.420\n That seems like discipline and dedication\n\n1:52:01.420 --> 1:52:05.300\n to like a stoic minimalism or something like that.\n\n1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:07.940\n I'm happy they do it, but I actually feel bad about it.\n\n1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:10.860\n I feel they're sacrificial victims to me,\n\n1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:12.620\n which I benefit from.\n\n1:52:12.620 --> 1:52:13.740\n But don't you ever think like,\n\n1:52:13.740 --> 1:52:16.900\n gee, you're a great master sushi chef.\n\n1:52:16.900 --> 1:52:20.220\n Wouldn't you be happier if you did something else?\n\n1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:23.500\n Doesn't seem to happen.\n\n1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:25.700\n That might be something that a weird mind would think.\n\n1:52:25.700 --> 1:52:27.260\n Maybe it is weird people,\n\n1:52:27.260 --> 1:52:29.820\n and maybe they're really enjoying it,\n\n1:52:29.820 --> 1:52:32.820\n but like to learn how to pack rice for 10 years\n\n1:52:32.820 --> 1:52:35.180\n before they let you do anything else.\n\n1:52:35.180 --> 1:52:37.820\n It's like these Indian, you know, sarod players.\n\n1:52:37.820 --> 1:52:40.380\n They just spent five years tapping out rhythms\n\n1:52:40.380 --> 1:52:43.420\n before they're allowed to touch their instruments.\n\n1:52:43.420 --> 1:52:46.220\n Well, actually to defend that.\n\n1:52:46.220 --> 1:52:48.460\n It's kind of like graduate school, right?\n\n1:52:48.460 --> 1:52:51.420\n Well, I think graduate school, perhaps.\n\n1:52:53.700 --> 1:52:54.860\n Graduate school is full of,\n\n1:52:54.860 --> 1:52:59.860\n like every single day is full of surprises, I would say.\n\n1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:01.940\n I did martial arts for a long time.\n\n1:53:01.940 --> 1:53:04.380\n I do martial arts, and I've always loved,\n\n1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:06.900\n it's kind of the Russian way of drilling,\n\n1:53:06.900 --> 1:53:09.180\n is doing the same technique.\n\n1:53:09.180 --> 1:53:10.500\n I don't know if this applies\n\n1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:13.220\n into intellectual or academic disciplines,\n\n1:53:13.220 --> 1:53:16.940\n where you can do the same thing over and over and over again,\n\n1:53:16.940 --> 1:53:19.940\n thousands and thousands and thousands of times.\n\n1:53:19.940 --> 1:53:23.620\n What I've discovered through that process\n\n1:53:23.620 --> 1:53:27.260\n is you get to start to appreciate the tiniest of details\n\n1:53:27.260 --> 1:53:29.420\n and find the beauty in them.\n\n1:53:29.420 --> 1:53:32.020\n People who go to like monasteries to meditate\n\n1:53:32.020 --> 1:53:35.620\n talk about this, is when you just sit in silence\n\n1:53:35.620 --> 1:53:37.420\n and don't do anything,\n\n1:53:37.420 --> 1:53:41.340\n you start to appreciate how much complexity and beauty\n\n1:53:41.340 --> 1:53:43.060\n there is in just the movement of a finger.\n\n1:53:43.060 --> 1:53:47.100\n Like you can spend the whole day joyously thinking about\n\n1:53:47.100 --> 1:53:49.540\n how fun it is to move a finger.\n\n1:53:49.540 --> 1:53:54.540\n And then you can almost become your full weird self\n\n1:53:54.700 --> 1:53:56.940\n about the tiniest details of life.\n\n1:53:56.940 --> 1:53:57.980\n As a thing, you've got to wonder,\n\n1:53:57.980 --> 1:53:59.780\n like, is there a free lunch in there?\n\n1:53:59.780 --> 1:54:01.900\n Are the rest of us moving around too much?\n\n1:54:01.900 --> 1:54:02.820\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:54:04.060 --> 1:54:06.620\n They sure feel like they found a free lunch.\n\n1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:09.180\n The people meditate, they're onto something.\n\n1:54:09.180 --> 1:54:11.260\n I tend to think it's like artists,\n\n1:54:11.260 --> 1:54:13.420\n that some percent of people are like that,\n\n1:54:13.420 --> 1:54:14.740\n but most are not.\n\n1:54:14.740 --> 1:54:16.820\n And for most of us, there's no free lunch.\n\n1:54:16.820 --> 1:54:19.100\n Like my free lunch is to move around a lot.\n\n1:54:19.100 --> 1:54:20.820\n In search of lunch, in fact.\n\n1:54:20.820 --> 1:54:24.460\n Well, with all the food talk, you made me hungry.\n\n1:54:24.460 --> 1:54:29.100\n What books, three or so books,\n\n1:54:29.100 --> 1:54:33.500\n if any come to mind, technical fiction, philosophical,\n\n1:54:33.500 --> 1:54:37.340\n would you recommend, had a big impact on you,\n\n1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:40.420\n or you just drew some insights from throughout your life?\n\n1:54:40.420 --> 1:54:42.340\n Well, two of them we've already discussed.\n\n1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:44.740\n One is Plato's Dialogues,\n\n1:54:44.740 --> 1:54:47.620\n which I started reading when I was like 13.\n\n1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:51.100\n Another is Ayn Rand, Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal.\n\n1:54:51.100 --> 1:54:53.860\n But I would say the Friedrich Hayek essay,\n\n1:54:53.860 --> 1:54:56.260\n The Use of Knowledge in Society,\n\n1:54:56.260 --> 1:54:58.940\n which is about how decentralized mechanisms can work,\n\n1:54:58.940 --> 1:55:01.060\n also why they might go wrong.\n\n1:55:01.060 --> 1:55:03.260\n And that's where you start to understand\n\n1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:05.220\n the price system, capitalism.\n\n1:55:05.220 --> 1:55:06.300\n And that was in a book called\n\n1:55:06.300 --> 1:55:08.020\n Individualism and Economic Order,\n\n1:55:08.020 --> 1:55:10.580\n but it was just a few essays in that book.\n\n1:55:10.580 --> 1:55:12.700\n Those are maybe the three I would cite.\n\n1:55:12.700 --> 1:55:14.580\n Can you elaborate a little bit on the...\n\n1:55:14.580 --> 1:55:16.380\n Say the price of copper goes up, right?\n\n1:55:16.380 --> 1:55:18.540\n Because there's a problem with the copper mine\n\n1:55:18.540 --> 1:55:20.660\n in Chile or Bolivia.\n\n1:55:20.660 --> 1:55:21.980\n So the price of copper goes up.\n\n1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:24.860\n All around the world, people are led to economize copper,\n\n1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:26.740\n to look for substitutes for copper,\n\n1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:28.860\n to change their production processes,\n\n1:55:28.860 --> 1:55:31.100\n to change the goods and services they buy,\n\n1:55:31.100 --> 1:55:32.660\n to build homes a different way.\n\n1:55:33.900 --> 1:55:35.500\n And this one event creates\n\n1:55:35.500 --> 1:55:38.100\n this one tiny change in information.\n\n1:55:38.100 --> 1:55:41.220\n This gets into your AI work very directly.\n\n1:55:41.220 --> 1:55:44.780\n And how much complexity that one change engenders\n\n1:55:44.780 --> 1:55:47.140\n in a meaningful, coherent way,\n\n1:55:47.140 --> 1:55:50.780\n how the different pieces of the price system fit together.\n\n1:55:50.780 --> 1:55:53.940\n Hayek really laid out very clearly.\n\n1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:56.340\n And it's like an AI problem.\n\n1:55:56.340 --> 1:55:57.980\n And how well, not for everything,\n\n1:55:57.980 --> 1:56:00.900\n but for many things, we solve that AI problem.\n\n1:56:00.900 --> 1:56:04.780\n I learned, I was, I think 13, maybe 14 when I read Hayek.\n\n1:56:04.780 --> 1:56:07.300\n Yeah, the distributed nature of things there.\n\n1:56:07.300 --> 1:56:09.100\n And it's like your work on human attention,\n\n1:56:09.100 --> 1:56:10.580\n like how much can we take in?\n\n1:56:10.580 --> 1:56:11.620\n Yes.\n\n1:56:11.620 --> 1:56:13.780\n Very often not that much.\n\n1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:16.460\n And how many of the advances of modern civilization\n\n1:56:16.460 --> 1:56:19.500\n you need to understand as a response to that constraint.\n\n1:56:19.500 --> 1:56:21.260\n I got that also from Hayek.\n\n1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:23.900\n And what's the title of the book again?\n\n1:56:23.900 --> 1:56:26.060\n It's reprinted in a lot of books at this point.\n\n1:56:26.060 --> 1:56:27.500\n But back then the book was called\n\n1:56:27.500 --> 1:56:30.460\n Individualism and Economic Order.\n\n1:56:30.460 --> 1:56:31.700\n But the essay is online.\n\n1:56:31.700 --> 1:56:34.500\n Hayek, Use of Knowledge in Society.\n\n1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:37.300\n There are open access versions of it through Google.\n\n1:56:37.300 --> 1:56:39.020\n And you don't need the whole book.\n\n1:56:39.020 --> 1:56:40.340\n So it's a very good book.\n\n1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:45.340\n Again, one of those profound looking over the ocean,\n\n1:56:46.140 --> 1:56:47.860\n maybe sitting on a porch,\n\n1:56:47.860 --> 1:56:49.700\n maybe with a drink of some kind.\n\n1:56:50.940 --> 1:56:55.020\n And a young kid comes by and asks you for advice.\n\n1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:56.620\n What advice would you give to?\n\n1:56:56.620 --> 1:56:57.460\n A drink.\n\n1:56:57.460 --> 1:56:58.620\n That's my advice.\n\n1:56:58.620 --> 1:56:59.460\n I'm serious.\n\n1:57:00.700 --> 1:57:03.100\n So, okay, after that,\n\n1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:09.420\n what advice would you give to a young person today\n\n1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:10.900\n as they take on life?\n\n1:57:10.900 --> 1:57:15.900\n Whether a career in academia in general or just a life,\n\n1:57:15.900 --> 1:57:19.340\n which is probably more important than career.\n\n1:57:19.340 --> 1:57:22.060\n Most good advice is context specific.\n\n1:57:22.060 --> 1:57:24.540\n But here are my two generic pieces of advice.\n\n1:57:24.540 --> 1:57:25.380\n Good.\n\n1:57:25.380 --> 1:57:27.180\n First, get a mentor.\n\n1:57:27.180 --> 1:57:29.100\n Both career, but anything you wanna learn.\n\n1:57:29.100 --> 1:57:31.580\n Like say you wanna learn about contemporary art.\n\n1:57:31.580 --> 1:57:33.060\n People write me this.\n\n1:57:33.060 --> 1:57:34.380\n Oh, what book should I read?\n\n1:57:34.380 --> 1:57:36.420\n It's probably not gonna work that way.\n\n1:57:36.420 --> 1:57:37.260\n You need a mentor.\n\n1:57:37.260 --> 1:57:39.140\n Yes, you should read some books on it.\n\n1:57:39.140 --> 1:57:40.820\n But you want a mentor to help you frame them,\n\n1:57:40.820 --> 1:57:43.900\n take you around to some art, talk about it with you.\n\n1:57:43.900 --> 1:57:45.580\n So get as many mentors as you can\n\n1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:47.660\n in the things you wanna learn.\n\n1:57:47.660 --> 1:57:48.500\n And then...\n\n1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:51.140\n Can I ask you a quick tangent on that?\n\n1:57:52.580 --> 1:57:54.380\n Presumably a good mentor.\n\n1:57:54.380 --> 1:57:55.220\n Of course.\n\n1:57:55.220 --> 1:57:56.060\n Is there...\n\n1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:56.900\n I'm begging the question in there.\n\n1:57:56.900 --> 1:57:59.220\n It's complicated, right?\n\n1:57:59.220 --> 1:58:00.300\n Well, it is complicated.\n\n1:58:00.300 --> 1:58:03.380\n Is there a lot of damage to be done from a bad mentor?\n\n1:58:03.380 --> 1:58:04.300\n I don't think that much\n\n1:58:04.300 --> 1:58:06.020\n because it's very easy to drop mentors.\n\n1:58:06.020 --> 1:58:07.980\n And in fact, it's quite hard to maintain them.\n\n1:58:07.980 --> 1:58:09.620\n Good mentors tend to be busy.\n\n1:58:09.620 --> 1:58:11.220\n Bad mentors tend to be busy.\n\n1:58:12.820 --> 1:58:14.260\n And you can try on mentors\n\n1:58:14.260 --> 1:58:15.460\n and maybe they're not good for you,\n\n1:58:15.460 --> 1:58:17.980\n but there's a good chance you'll learn something.\n\n1:58:19.460 --> 1:58:21.060\n Like I had a mentor, I was an undergrad.\n\n1:58:21.060 --> 1:58:22.620\n He was a Stalinist.\n\n1:58:22.620 --> 1:58:24.700\n He edited the book called The Essential Stalin.\n\n1:58:24.700 --> 1:58:25.740\n Brilliant guy.\n\n1:58:25.740 --> 1:58:28.220\n I learned a tremendous amount from him.\n\n1:58:28.220 --> 1:58:30.660\n Was he like as a Stalinist a good mentor for me?\n\n1:58:30.660 --> 1:58:31.500\n Fan of Hayek?\n\n1:58:31.500 --> 1:58:32.500\n Well, no.\n\n1:58:32.500 --> 1:58:34.180\n But for a year it was tremendous.\n\n1:58:34.180 --> 1:58:35.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:38.220 --> 1:58:40.180\n He introduced me like to Soviet\n\n1:58:40.180 --> 1:58:41.780\n and Eastern European science fiction\n\n1:58:41.780 --> 1:58:43.500\n because he was a Marxist.\n\n1:58:43.500 --> 1:58:45.420\n Like that's what I took from him among other things.\n\n1:58:45.420 --> 1:58:47.700\n Any advice on finding a good mentor?\n\n1:58:47.700 --> 1:58:50.980\n Daniel Kahneman has...\n\n1:58:50.980 --> 1:58:52.700\n Somebody just popped this to mind\n\n1:58:52.700 --> 1:58:54.300\n as somebody who was able to find\n\n1:58:54.300 --> 1:58:57.100\n exceptionally good collaborators throughout his life.\n\n1:58:57.100 --> 1:59:00.380\n There's not many bright minds that find collaborators.\n\n1:59:00.380 --> 1:59:05.380\n They often, which I ultimately see what a mentor is.\n\n1:59:06.420 --> 1:59:07.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:59:07.260 --> 1:59:08.900\n Be interesting, be direct and try.\n\n1:59:10.180 --> 1:59:11.660\n It's not like a perfect formula,\n\n1:59:11.660 --> 1:59:12.940\n but it's amazing how many people\n\n1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:14.220\n don't even do those things.\n\n1:59:14.220 --> 1:59:17.540\n Be interesting, be direct and try.\n\n1:59:17.540 --> 1:59:20.140\n Like what you want from a better known person,\n\n1:59:20.140 --> 1:59:22.220\n I would just say be very direct with them.\n\n1:59:22.220 --> 1:59:23.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:59:23.940 --> 1:59:24.780\n Beautiful.\n\n1:59:24.780 --> 1:59:26.540\n What's the second piece of advice?\n\n1:59:26.540 --> 1:59:29.300\n Build small groups of peers.\n\n1:59:29.300 --> 1:59:30.740\n They don't have to be your age,\n\n1:59:30.740 --> 1:59:32.340\n but very often they'll be your age,\n\n1:59:32.340 --> 1:59:33.820\n especially if you're younger\n\n1:59:33.820 --> 1:59:35.380\n with broadly similar interests,\n\n1:59:35.380 --> 1:59:37.260\n but there can be different points of view.\n\n1:59:37.260 --> 1:59:38.980\n People you hang out with,\n\n1:59:38.980 --> 1:59:41.780\n which can include in a WhatsApp group online\n\n1:59:41.780 --> 1:59:43.860\n and like every day or almost every day,\n\n1:59:43.860 --> 1:59:46.180\n they're talking about the thing you care about,\n\n1:59:46.180 --> 1:59:48.780\n trying to solve problems in that thing.\n\n1:59:48.780 --> 1:59:51.060\n And that's your small group and you really like them\n\n1:59:51.060 --> 1:59:52.260\n and they like you and you care\n\n1:59:52.260 --> 1:59:53.940\n what you think about each other\n\n1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:55.860\n and you have this common interest.\n\n1:59:55.860 --> 1:59:57.220\n That's for human connection\n\n1:59:57.220 --> 1:59:58.860\n or that's for development of ideas?\n\n1:59:58.860 --> 2:00:01.380\n It's both, they're not that different.\n\n2:00:01.380 --> 2:00:03.860\n Like Beatles, classic small group, right?\n\n2:00:05.220 --> 2:00:06.580\n But there's so much drama.\n\n2:00:06.580 --> 2:00:08.540\n The Florentine artists, of course there's drama\n\n2:00:08.540 --> 2:00:10.900\n and small groups tend to split up, which is fine,\n\n2:00:10.900 --> 2:00:13.340\n just like entering relationships off an end.\n\n2:00:14.180 --> 2:00:16.900\n But it's remarkable how little has been done\n\n2:00:16.900 --> 2:00:19.940\n that was not done in small groups in some way.\n\n2:00:19.940 --> 2:00:24.940\n So speaking of loss of beautiful relationships,\n\n2:00:24.940 --> 2:00:27.860\n where do you make this whole love thing?\n\n2:00:29.260 --> 2:00:31.620\n Why do humans fall in love?\n\n2:00:31.620 --> 2:00:35.940\n What's the role of love, friendship, family in life?\n\n2:00:37.420 --> 2:00:40.020\n In a successful life or just life in general?\n\n2:00:40.020 --> 2:00:42.100\n Why the hell are we so into this thing?\n\n2:00:42.100 --> 2:00:44.820\n There are multiple layers of understanding that question.\n\n2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:48.660\n So kind of the lowest layer is the Darwinian answer, right?\n\n2:00:48.660 --> 2:00:50.340\n If we weren't this way,\n\n2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:51.700\n we wouldn't have been successful\n\n2:00:51.700 --> 2:00:54.420\n in reproducing and building alliances.\n\n2:00:54.420 --> 2:00:57.580\n It's important to realize that's far from complete.\n\n2:00:57.580 --> 2:00:59.940\n Sort of the highest understanding would be poetic,\n\n2:00:59.940 --> 2:01:03.620\n like read John Keats or many other love poets.\n\n2:01:03.620 --> 2:01:05.540\n So who do I go to to find out,\n\n2:01:05.540 --> 2:01:07.980\n to learn about love in terms of poets or?\n\n2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:10.020\n I would say start with John Keats.\n\n2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:12.500\n But given that you're fluent in Russian.\n\n2:01:13.740 --> 2:01:16.060\n Yeah, let's go Russian literature for a second.\n\n2:01:16.060 --> 2:01:18.580\n Like you keep mentioning Russia.\n\n2:01:18.580 --> 2:01:21.180\n What's your connection?\n\n2:01:21.180 --> 2:01:25.100\n What's your love in Russia?\n\n2:01:25.100 --> 2:01:26.380\n Well, first it's all interesting,\n\n2:01:26.380 --> 2:01:29.340\n but more concretely, my wife was born in Moscow.\n\n2:01:29.340 --> 2:01:31.460\n So Kolniki was her neighborhood.\n\n2:01:31.460 --> 2:01:32.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:01:32.300 --> 2:01:33.140\n Wow.\n\n2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:34.180\n And she grew up there.\n\n2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:35.500\n I married her here.\n\n2:01:36.740 --> 2:01:38.340\n My daughter, I adopted her.\n\n2:01:38.340 --> 2:01:41.260\n I'm not her biological father, but I genuinely raised her.\n\n2:01:41.260 --> 2:01:42.540\n She was born in Russia,\n\n2:01:42.540 --> 2:01:44.340\n though she came here when she was one.\n\n2:01:45.500 --> 2:01:46.340\n My father in law.\n\n2:01:46.340 --> 2:01:47.260\n So you're basically Russian.\n\n2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:48.100\n No, no, no.\n\n2:01:48.100 --> 2:01:49.180\n I'm a New Jersey boy.\n\n2:01:49.180 --> 2:01:51.140\n That's the same thing.\n\n2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:52.220\n I'm very sorry to report.\n\n2:01:52.220 --> 2:01:54.820\n My father in law passed away a week ago.\n\n2:01:54.820 --> 2:01:57.300\n He lived with us for six years.\n\n2:01:57.300 --> 2:02:01.460\n He lived in Russia till he was, oh, 70.\n\n2:02:01.460 --> 2:02:04.180\n Saw Stalinist error.\n\n2:02:04.180 --> 2:02:05.820\n His father was brought to a camp,\n\n2:02:05.820 --> 2:02:07.780\n lived through World War II.\n\n2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:09.580\n Much, much more.\n\n2:02:09.580 --> 2:02:11.820\n Had an incredible life.\n\n2:02:11.820 --> 2:02:14.500\n Never really learned how to speak English.\n\n2:02:14.500 --> 2:02:17.940\n So I absorbed something Russian from him as well.\n\n2:02:17.940 --> 2:02:19.260\n He was part Armenian.\n\n2:02:20.260 --> 2:02:21.980\n So that's my connection to Russia.\n\n2:02:21.980 --> 2:02:24.060\n A bit of the Russian soul, too.\n\n2:02:24.060 --> 2:02:24.900\n Do you?\n\n2:02:24.900 --> 2:02:25.740\n I don't think I have it.\n\n2:02:25.740 --> 2:02:27.580\n I think I appreciate it.\n\n2:02:27.580 --> 2:02:29.020\n But there's division of labor, right?\n\n2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:30.140\n Others in the family.\n\n2:02:31.380 --> 2:02:32.220\n Take care of that.\n\n2:02:32.220 --> 2:02:34.180\n I'm more superficial.\n\n2:02:34.180 --> 2:02:36.940\n You mentioned Keats and that higher version,\n\n2:02:36.940 --> 2:02:38.420\n that non Darwinian love.\n\n2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:39.700\n What's that about?\n\n2:02:39.700 --> 2:02:42.340\n That it's the highest form of human connection\n\n2:02:42.340 --> 2:02:46.860\n and it's intoxicating and it's part of building a life.\n\n2:02:46.860 --> 2:02:50.340\n And most of us are very, very strongly drawn to it.\n\n2:02:50.340 --> 2:02:52.540\n And it's part of the highest realization\n\n2:02:52.540 --> 2:02:54.660\n of you being what you can be.\n\n2:02:54.660 --> 2:02:55.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:02:56.580 --> 2:02:57.540\n He mentioned you lost.\n\n2:02:57.540 --> 2:02:58.380\n But ask a Russian.\n\n2:02:58.380 --> 2:03:01.460\n I mean, this is a superficial New Jersey boy\n\n2:03:01.460 --> 2:03:03.820\n who grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen\n\n2:03:03.820 --> 2:03:05.620\n and that was his romanticism.\n\n2:03:05.620 --> 2:03:09.580\n What's your favorite Bruce Springsteen song?\n\n2:03:09.580 --> 2:03:14.100\n I think the album Born to Run has actually held up the best.\n\n2:03:14.100 --> 2:03:15.900\n Though it's very fashionable to think\n\n2:03:15.900 --> 2:03:18.340\n the earlier or later works are actually better.\n\n2:03:18.340 --> 2:03:21.100\n And that's the overproduced super pop album.\n\n2:03:21.100 --> 2:03:22.380\n But the quality of the songs,\n\n2:03:22.380 --> 2:03:25.380\n to me Born to Run is just far and away the best.\n\n2:03:25.380 --> 2:03:27.540\n Then Darkness on the Edge of Town.\n\n2:03:27.540 --> 2:03:29.860\n And those are still my favorites.\n\n2:03:29.860 --> 2:03:31.660\n Born to Run is an incredible song.\n\n2:03:33.060 --> 2:03:36.460\n And perfectly produced in a Phil Spector kind of way.\n\n2:03:36.460 --> 2:03:38.020\n Every detail is right.\n\n2:03:38.020 --> 2:03:39.220\n Every lyric.\n\n2:03:39.220 --> 2:03:40.580\n What else is on the album?\n\n2:03:40.580 --> 2:03:43.540\n Thunder Road, Jungle Land, Tenth Avenue, Freeze Out.\n\n2:03:43.540 --> 2:03:46.620\n She's the one, unbelievable.\n\n2:03:46.620 --> 2:03:47.460\n Yeah, Bruce is amazing.\n\n2:03:47.460 --> 2:03:48.900\n Leading across the river.\n\n2:03:48.900 --> 2:03:53.900\n I really like when he goes into love personally.\n\n2:03:55.860 --> 2:03:57.780\n Like I'm on fire.\n\n2:03:57.780 --> 2:04:00.340\n That's a very good song, Dancing in the Dark.\n\n2:04:00.340 --> 2:04:01.420\n A lot of the later work,\n\n2:04:01.420 --> 2:04:04.020\n I find the percussion becomes too simple\n\n2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:06.740\n and kind of too white somehow.\n\n2:04:06.740 --> 2:04:08.100\n And a little clunky.\n\n2:04:08.100 --> 2:04:09.580\n And it's still good work.\n\n2:04:09.580 --> 2:04:12.820\n He's super talented, but it doesn't speak to me.\n\n2:04:12.820 --> 2:04:16.020\n But when it all bursts open into the open road,\n\n2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:18.380\n like it does on Born to Run, that's magic.\n\n2:04:19.660 --> 2:04:20.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:21.340\n Or Rosalita.\n\n2:04:21.340 --> 2:04:22.660\n Have you ever seen him live?\n\n2:04:23.980 --> 2:04:24.900\n Yes, twice.\n\n2:04:26.140 --> 2:04:28.620\n I wonder what he's like live when he was young, right?\n\n2:04:28.620 --> 2:04:29.460\n Those years.\n\n2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:31.220\n I saw him live when he was young.\n\n2:04:31.220 --> 2:04:32.060\n I was young.\n\n2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:34.460\n New Jersey.\n\n2:04:34.460 --> 2:04:37.260\n I was a little disappointed actually.\n\n2:04:37.260 --> 2:04:41.180\n I think what I like best from him is quite studio.\n\n2:04:41.180 --> 2:04:42.260\n He certainly played well.\n\n2:04:42.260 --> 2:04:44.060\n I don't fault his performance.\n\n2:04:44.060 --> 2:04:47.580\n But it's like when I saw Plant and Page of Led Zeppelin.\n\n2:04:47.580 --> 2:04:48.980\n Tremendous creators.\n\n2:04:48.980 --> 2:04:49.820\n And they showed up.\n\n2:04:49.820 --> 2:04:50.660\n They were not drunk.\n\n2:04:50.660 --> 2:04:52.140\n Like they were paying attention.\n\n2:04:52.140 --> 2:04:54.060\n But I was underwhelmed.\n\n2:04:54.060 --> 2:04:56.660\n Because Led Zeppelin, like the Beatles White album,\n\n2:04:56.660 --> 2:04:59.740\n is much more of a studio band than you think at first.\n\n2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:01.220\n And in the case of Bruce Springsteen,\n\n2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:03.220\n I don't know about you, but for me,\n\n2:05:03.220 --> 2:05:05.940\n he's somebody that I connect with the most\n\n2:05:05.940 --> 2:05:10.100\n when I'm alone and there's like a melancholy feeling.\n\n2:05:10.100 --> 2:05:12.620\n And actually, my folks live in Philly.\n\n2:05:12.620 --> 2:05:14.860\n I went to school in Philly.\n\n2:05:14.860 --> 2:05:18.420\n And so, you know, I've, I think I've.\n\n2:05:18.420 --> 2:05:20.020\n You're almost worthy of New Jersey then.\n\n2:05:20.020 --> 2:05:24.020\n Yeah, well you're, you're almost worthy of Russia.\n\n2:05:24.020 --> 2:05:27.260\n So we're, we can connect.\n\n2:05:27.260 --> 2:05:28.580\n And then ask, but I mean, I love Jersey.\n\n2:05:28.580 --> 2:05:33.580\n This is something I feel like, I feel like, I don't know.\n\n2:05:34.660 --> 2:05:36.660\n It's always, there's this beautiful,\n\n2:05:36.660 --> 2:05:39.020\n like there's a diner, Olga's Diner that closed down.\n\n2:05:39.020 --> 2:05:41.540\n I used to go there.\n\n2:05:41.540 --> 2:05:43.860\n There's, there's a melancholy feeling to me.\n\n2:05:43.860 --> 2:05:44.700\n I mean, of course.\n\n2:05:44.700 --> 2:05:47.780\n A thickness to culture in that part of the world.\n\n2:05:47.780 --> 2:05:49.940\n Which is oddly similar to some elements\n\n2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:51.940\n of the thickness of Russian culture.\n\n2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:55.580\n And when you see like Russian characters on the Sopranos,\n\n2:05:55.580 --> 2:05:56.700\n it totally makes sense,\n\n2:05:56.700 --> 2:05:59.460\n even though there are these complete outliers.\n\n2:05:59.460 --> 2:06:01.820\n Exactly, it totally makes sense.\n\n2:06:01.820 --> 2:06:06.180\n You've, you mentioned you lost your father in law last week.\n\n2:06:06.180 --> 2:06:09.580\n Do you think about mortality?\n\n2:06:09.580 --> 2:06:12.420\n Do you think about your own mortality?\n\n2:06:12.420 --> 2:06:14.820\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n2:06:14.820 --> 2:06:17.300\n I don't think about my own mortality that much,\n\n2:06:17.300 --> 2:06:19.020\n which is probably a good thing.\n\n2:06:19.900 --> 2:06:22.340\n I think death will be bad.\n\n2:06:22.340 --> 2:06:23.900\n I wouldn't say I'm afraid of it.\n\n2:06:23.900 --> 2:06:25.420\n For me, the worst thing about death\n\n2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:28.660\n is not knowing how the human story turns out.\n\n2:06:28.660 --> 2:06:29.780\n The full human story.\n\n2:06:29.780 --> 2:06:30.660\n The full human story.\n\n2:06:30.660 --> 2:06:32.780\n So if I could, right before I die,\n\n2:06:32.780 --> 2:06:36.500\n read like a Wikipedia page called The Rest of Human History\n\n2:06:36.500 --> 2:06:38.220\n and have enough time, just like a few days,\n\n2:06:38.220 --> 2:06:40.220\n to absorb it, think about it,\n\n2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:43.220\n and know like, oh, well 643 years from now,\n\n2:06:43.220 --> 2:06:45.060\n that's when all the atomic weapons went off\n\n2:06:45.060 --> 2:06:47.900\n and here's what happened between now and then,\n\n2:06:47.900 --> 2:06:49.580\n I would feel much better dying.\n\n2:06:52.180 --> 2:06:54.100\n But that's not how it's gonna be, right?\n\n2:06:54.100 --> 2:06:55.020\n That's unlikely.\n\n2:06:55.020 --> 2:06:57.020\n It's almost like the Hitchhiker's Guide,\n\n2:06:57.020 --> 2:06:58.780\n they kind of have, what is it?\n\n2:06:58.780 --> 2:07:01.900\n They have a one or two sentence description of the human,\n\n2:07:01.900 --> 2:07:03.580\n of what goes on on Earth.\n\n2:07:03.580 --> 2:07:05.020\n It's kind of interesting to think\n\n2:07:05.020 --> 2:07:07.980\n if there's a lot of intelligent civilizations out there\n\n2:07:07.980 --> 2:07:10.980\n that in the big encyclopedia that describes the universe,\n\n2:07:10.980 --> 2:07:13.660\n humans will only have one sentence, maybe two.\n\n2:07:13.660 --> 2:07:15.100\n Probably true.\n\n2:07:15.100 --> 2:07:15.940\n Yeah.\n\n2:07:15.940 --> 2:07:18.620\n But it's the only one I can read and understand, right?\n\n2:07:18.620 --> 2:07:20.740\n And it may be hard to understand the human one\n\n2:07:20.740 --> 2:07:22.860\n past a number of centuries.\n\n2:07:22.860 --> 2:07:24.580\n Yeah, with AI, yes.\n\n2:07:26.420 --> 2:07:29.060\n Like how many years from now will reading Wikipedia\n\n2:07:29.060 --> 2:07:31.140\n be like trying to read Chaucer,\n\n2:07:31.140 --> 2:07:33.380\n which I almost can do, but I actually can't.\n\n2:07:33.380 --> 2:07:34.860\n I need a translation.\n\n2:07:34.860 --> 2:07:36.380\n Probably you can't do it at all.\n\n2:07:36.380 --> 2:07:37.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:07:37.580 --> 2:07:39.380\n I mean, maybe reading will be outdated.\n\n2:07:39.380 --> 2:07:41.660\n It might be a very silly notion.\n\n2:07:41.660 --> 2:07:43.540\n Maybe we're fundamentally,\n\n2:07:43.540 --> 2:07:46.060\n like we think language is fundamental to cognition,\n\n2:07:46.060 --> 2:07:47.380\n but it could be something visual\n\n2:07:47.380 --> 2:07:50.260\n or something totally different that we'll plug in.\n\n2:07:50.260 --> 2:07:51.700\n Neuralink or, yeah.\n\n2:07:53.500 --> 2:07:55.820\n But in that story, that Wikipedia article,\n\n2:07:55.820 --> 2:08:00.940\n do you think there'll be a section on the meaning of it?\n\n2:08:00.940 --> 2:08:04.780\n I hope not, because that section we could write now,\n\n2:08:04.780 --> 2:08:07.220\n and it's just not going to be very good, right?\n\n2:08:07.220 --> 2:08:08.580\n What would you put in the section\n\n2:08:08.580 --> 2:08:11.620\n on the meaning of human existence?\n\n2:08:11.620 --> 2:08:13.820\n I don't know, links to a lot of other sections?\n\n2:08:15.940 --> 2:08:17.380\n I don't think there are general statements\n\n2:08:17.380 --> 2:08:19.860\n about the meaning of life that have that much meaning.\n\n2:08:19.860 --> 2:08:21.980\n I think if you study different cultures,\n\n2:08:21.980 --> 2:08:23.780\n the arts, travel, mathematics,\n\n2:08:23.780 --> 2:08:25.420\n like whatever your thing is,\n\n2:08:25.420 --> 2:08:27.220\n you'll get a lot about the meaning of life.\n\n2:08:27.220 --> 2:08:30.660\n So like it's there in Wikipedia in some bigger sense.\n\n2:08:30.660 --> 2:08:32.180\n But I don't want to read the page on the meaning.\n\n2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:34.300\n I bet they have such a page, in fact.\n\n2:08:34.300 --> 2:08:36.020\n The fact that I've never visited it,\n\n2:08:36.020 --> 2:08:37.740\n none of my friends, oh, here, Tyler,\n\n2:08:37.740 --> 2:08:39.100\n here's the page on the meaning of life.\n\n2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:40.340\n I know you've been wondering about this.\n\n2:08:40.340 --> 2:08:41.580\n You got to read this one.\n\n2:08:41.580 --> 2:08:43.300\n No one's ever done that to you, have they?\n\n2:08:43.300 --> 2:08:46.020\n It probably has, well, I've actually gone to that page.\n\n2:08:46.020 --> 2:08:48.500\n It does, in fact, have a lot of links to other pages.\n\n2:08:48.500 --> 2:08:49.340\n Okay.\n\n2:08:51.020 --> 2:08:52.540\n So that's it.\n\n2:08:52.540 --> 2:08:57.180\n The meaning of life is just a bunch of self referential\n\n2:08:57.180 --> 2:09:02.180\n or citation needed type of statements.\n\n2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:03.860\n I think there's no better way to end it.\n\n2:09:03.860 --> 2:09:05.100\n Tyler, it's a huge honor.\n\n2:09:05.100 --> 2:09:06.300\n I'm a huge fan.\n\n2:09:07.500 --> 2:09:10.060\n Thank you so much for wasting all of this time with me.\n\n2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:11.980\n It was one of the greatest conversations I've ever had.\n\n2:09:11.980 --> 2:09:12.820\n Thank you so much.\n\n2:09:12.820 --> 2:09:15.220\n My pleasure and delighted to finally have met you\n\n2:09:15.220 --> 2:09:16.860\n and that we can do this.\n\n2:09:17.740 --> 2:09:20.260\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tyler Cowen\n\n2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:23.580\n and thank you to Linode, ExpressVPN,\n\n2:09:23.580 --> 2:09:25.940\n SimpliSafe and Public Goods.\n\n2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:29.580\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n2:09:29.580 --> 2:09:33.660\n And now let me leave you with some words from Adam Smith.\n\n2:09:33.660 --> 2:09:36.580\n Little else is requisite to carry a state\n\n2:09:36.580 --> 2:09:38.580\n to the highest degree of opulence\n\n2:09:38.580 --> 2:09:42.660\n from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes\n\n2:09:42.660 --> 2:09:45.900\n and a tolerable administration of justice.\n\n2:09:45.900 --> 2:09:57.500\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
