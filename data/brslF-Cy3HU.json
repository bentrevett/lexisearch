  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.080\n The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis.\n\n00:03.080 --> 00:05.440\n He's a professor at MIT and head\n\n00:05.440 --> 00:08.400\n of the MIT Computational Biology Group.\n\n00:08.400 --> 00:11.280\n He's interested in understanding the human genome\n\n00:11.280 --> 00:14.160\n from a computational, evolutionary, biological,\n\n00:14.160 --> 00:17.000\n and other cross disciplinary perspectives.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:20.160\n He has more big, impactful papers and awards\n\n00:20.160 --> 00:22.480\n than I can list, but most importantly,\n\n00:22.480 --> 00:26.240\n he's a kind, curious, brilliant human being,\n\n00:26.240 --> 00:28.720\n and just someone I really enjoy talking to.\n\n00:28.720 --> 00:32.960\n His passion for science and life in general is contagious.\n\n00:32.960 --> 00:34.640\n The hours honestly flew by,\n\n00:34.640 --> 00:37.720\n and I'm sure we'll talk again on this podcast soon.\n\n00:37.720 --> 00:39.120\n Quick summary of the ads.\n\n00:39.120 --> 00:43.160\n Three sponsors, Blinkist, Aidsleep, and Masterclass.\n\n00:43.160 --> 00:44.960\n Please consider

degrees\n\n02:29.200 --> 02:31.480\n on each side of the bed separately.\n\n02:31.480 --> 02:33.840\n Research shows that temperature has a big impact\n\n02:33.840 --> 02:35.680\n on the quality of our sleep.\n\n02:35.680 --> 02:37.840\n Anecdotally, as been true for me,\n\n02:37.840 --> 02:39.840\n it's truly been a game changer.\n\n02:39.840 --> 02:40.880\n I love it.\n\n02:40.880 -->

03:53.480\n And now, here's my conversation with Manolis Kellis.\n\n03:54.600 --> 03:56.880\n What to you is the most beautiful aspect\n\n03:56.880 --> 03:58.640\n of the human genome?\n\n03:58.640 --> 04:00.040\n Don't get me started.\n\n04:00.040 --> 04:04.280\n So. We've got time.\n\n04:04.280 --> 04:06.360\n The first answer is that the beauty of genomes\n\n04:06.360 --> 04:07.680\n transcends humanity.\n\n04:07.680 --> 04:09.440\n So it's not just about the human genome.\n\n04:09.440 --> 04:12.640\n Genomes in general are amazingly beautiful.\n\n04:12.640 --> 04:14.040\n And again, I'm obviously biased.\n\n04:14.040 --> 04:18.680\n So in my view, the way that I like to introduce\n\n04:18.680 --> 04:20.840\n the human genome and the way that I like to introduce\n\n04:20.840 --> 04:22.920\n genomics to my class is by telling them,\n\n04:22.920 --> 04:24.960\n you know, we're not the inventors\n\n04:24.960 --> 04:26.560\n of the first digital computer.\n\n04:26.560 --> 04:29.320\n We are the descendants of the first digital computer.\n\n04:30.600 --> 04:32.360\n Basically, life is digital.\n\n04:32.360 --> 04:34.600\n And that's absolutely beautiful about life.\n\n04:34.600 --> 04:37.080\n The fact that at every replication step,\n\n04:37.080 --> 04:38.480\n you don't lose any information\n\n04:38.480 --> 04:40.040\n because that information is digital.\n\n04:40.040 --> 04:43.160\n If it was analog, if it was just sprouting concentrations,\n\n04:43.160 --> 04:44.640\n you'd lose it after a few generations.\n\n04:44.640 --> 04:46.360\n It would just dissolve away.\n\n04:46.360 --> 04:48.240\n And that's what the ancients\n\n04:48.240 --> 04:50.080\n didn't understand about inheritance.\n\n04:50.080 --> 04:52.120\n The first person to understand digital inheritance\n\n04:52.120 --> 04:54.440\n was Mendel, of course.\n\n04:54.440 --> 04:57.600\n And his theory, in fact, stayed in a bookshelf\n\n04:57.600 --> 05:00.720\n for like 50 years while Darwin was getting famous\n\n05:00.720 --> 05:02.440\n about natural selection.\n\n05:02.440 --> 05:05.440\n But the missing component was this digital inheritance,\n\n05:05.440 --> 05:09.720\n the mechanism of evolution that Mendel had discovered.\n\n05:09.720 --> 05:13.120\n So that aspect in my view is the most beautiful aspect\n\n05:13.120 --> 05:14.880\n but it transcends all of life.\n\n05:14.880 --> 05:18.040\n And can you elaborate maybe the inheritance part?\n\n05:18.040 --> 05:22.480\n What was the key thing that the ancients didn't understand?\n\n05:22.480 --> 05:27.480\n So the very theory of inheritance as discrete units,\n\n05:28.520 --> 05:32.880\n throughout the life of Mendel and well after he's writing,\n\n05:32.880 --> 05:35.240\n people thought that his P experiments\n\n05:35.240 --> 05:36.600\n were just a little fluke,\n\n05:36.600 --> 05:38.760\n that they were just a little exception\n\n05:38.760 --> 05:41.840\n that would normally not even apply to humans,\n\n05:41.840 --> 05:44.200\n that basically what they saw\n\n05:44.200 --> 05:48.080\n is this continuum of eye color,\n\n05:48.080 --> 05:49.760\n this continuum of skin color,\n\n05:49.760 --> 05:51.120\n this continuum of hair color,\n\n05:51.120 --> 05:52.520\n this continuum of height.\n\n05:52.520 --> 05:55.080\n And all of these continuums did not fit\n\n05:55.080 --> 05:56.800\n with a discrete type of inheritance\n\n05:56.800 --> 05:58.920\n that Mendel was describing.\n\n05:58.920 --> 06:00.480\n But what's unique about genomics\n\n06:00.480 --> 06:01.640\n and what's unique about the genome\n\n06:01.640 --> 06:03.840\n is really that there are two copies\n\n06:03.840 --> 06:06.240\n and that you get a combination of these.\n\n06:06.240 --> 06:08.200\n But for every trait,\n\n06:08.200 --> 06:10.720\n there are dozens of contributing variables.\n\n06:10.720 --> 06:14.000\n And it was only Ronald Fisher in the 20th century\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:19.000\n that basically recognized that even five Mendelian traits\n\n06:20.120 --> 06:24.920\n would add up to a continuum like inheritance pattern.\n\n06:24.920 --> 06:27.520\n And he wrote a series of papers\n\n06:27.520 --> 06:30.360\n that still are very relevant today\n\n06:30.360 --> 06:32.960\n about sort of this Mendelian inheritance\n\n06:32.960 --> 06:35.200\n of continuum like traits.\n\n06:35.200 --> 06:38.520\n And I think that that was the missing step in inheritance.\n\n06:38.520 --> 06:41.560\n So well before the discovery of the structure of DNA,\n\n06:41.560 --> 06:44.400\n which is again, another amazingly beautiful aspect,\n\n06:44.400 --> 06:45.240\n the double helix,\n\n06:45.240 --> 06:48.480\n what I like to call the most noble molecule of our time,\n\n06:50.320 --> 06:54.080\n holds within it the secret of that discrete inheritance,\n\n06:54.080 --> 06:58.480\n but the conceptualization of discrete elements\n\n06:58.480 --> 06:59.680\n is something that precedes that.\n\n06:59.680 --> 07:01.440\n So even though it's discrete,\n\n07:01.440 --> 07:06.440\n when it materializes itself into actual traits that we see,\n\n07:06.560 --> 07:08.000\n it can be continuous.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.840\n Basically arbitrarily rich and complex.\n\n07:10.840 --> 07:15.000\n So if you have five genes that contribute to human height,\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:16.960\n and there aren't five, there's a thousand.\n\n07:16.960 --> 07:18.440\n If there's only five genes\n\n07:18.440 --> 07:20.880\n and you inherit some combination of them,\n\n07:20.880 --> 07:23.080\n and every one makes you two inches taller\n\n07:23.080 --> 07:24.520\n or two inches shorter,\n\n07:24.520 --> 07:27.440\n it'll look like a continuous trait.\n\n07:28.520 --> 07:30.440\n But instead of five, there are thousands.\n\n07:30.440 --> 07:33.880\n And every one of them contributes to less than one millimeter.\n\n07:33.880 --> 07:36.920\n We change in height more during the day\n\n07:36.920 --> 07:39.280\n than each of these genetic variants contributes.\n\n07:40.160 --> 07:43.960\n So by the evening, you're shorter than you walk up with.\n\n07:43.960 --> 07:45.320\n Isn't that weird then\n\n07:45.320 --> 07:48.080\n that we're not more different than we are?\n\n07:48.080 --> 07:49.680\n Why are we all so similar\n\n07:49.680 --> 07:52.600\n if there's so much possibility to be different?\n\n07:52.600 --> 07:57.480\n Yeah, so there are selective advantages to being medium.\n\n07:57.480 --> 07:59.920\n If you're extremely tall or extremely short,\n\n07:59.920 --> 08:02.280\n you run into selective disadvantages.\n\n08:02.280 --> 08:04.160\n So you have trouble breathing, you have trouble running,\n\n08:04.160 --> 08:06.320\n you have trouble sitting if you're too tall.\n\n08:06.320 --> 08:08.240\n If you're too short, you might, I don't know,\n\n08:08.240 --> 08:11.000\n have other selective pressures are acting against that.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.600\n If you look at natural history of human population,\n\n08:13.600 --> 08:17.000\n there's actually selection for height in Northern Europe\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.960\n and selection against height in Southern Europe.\n\n08:19.960 --> 08:21.800\n So there might actually be advantages\n\n08:21.800 --> 08:25.000\n to actually being not super tall.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.720\n And if you look across the entire human population,\n\n08:28.720 --> 08:29.840\n for many, many traits,\n\n08:29.840 --> 08:32.080\n there's a lot of push towards the middle.\n\n08:32.080 --> 08:35.280\n Balancing selection is the usual term\n\n08:35.280 --> 08:39.680\n for selection that sort of seeks to not be extreme\n\n08:39.680 --> 08:43.600\n and to sort of have a combination of alleles\n\n08:43.600 --> 08:45.920\n that sort of keep recombining.\n\n08:45.920 --> 08:48.640\n And if you look at mate selection,\n\n08:48.640 --> 08:50.320\n super, super tall people\n\n08:50.320 --> 08:53.360\n will not tend to sort of marry super, super tall people.\n\n08:53.360 --> 08:55.200\n Very often you see these couples\n\n08:55.200 --> 08:57.960\n that are kind of compensating for each other.\n\n08:57.960 --> 09:00.440\n And the best predictor of the kid's age\n\n09:00.440 --> 09:03.520\n is very often just take the average of the two parents\n\n09:03.520 --> 09:07.080\n and then adjust for sex and boom, you get it.\n\n09:07.080 --> 09:08.520\n It's extremely heritable.\n\n09:08.520 --> 09:12.680\n Let me ask, you kind of took a step back to the genome\n\n09:12.680 --> 09:13.880\n outside of just humans,\n\n09:13.880 --> 09:15.880\n but is there something that you find beautiful\n\n09:15.880 --> 09:18.600\n about the human genome specifically?\n\n09:18.600 --> 09:21.360\n So I think the genome,\n\n09:21.360 --> 09:24.440\n if more people understood the beauty of the human genome,\n\n09:24.440 --> 09:26.600\n there would be so many fewer wars,\n\n09:26.600 --> 09:28.960\n so much less anger in the world.\n\n09:28.960 --> 09:31.400\n I mean, what's really beautiful about the human genome\n\n09:31.400 --> 09:33.840\n is really the variation\n\n09:33.840 --> 09:36.520\n that teaches us both about individuality\n\n09:36.520 --> 09:38.200\n and about similarity.\n\n09:38.200 --> 09:42.360\n So any two people on the planet are 99.9% identical.\n\n09:43.440 --> 09:47.280\n How can you fight with someone who's 99.9% identical to you?\n\n09:47.280 --> 09:49.680\n It's just counterintuitive.\n\n09:49.680 --> 09:53.880\n And yet any two siblings of the same parents\n\n09:53.880 --> 09:57.080\n differ in millions of locations.\n\n09:57.080 --> 10:01.000\n So every one of them is basically two to the million unique\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.120\n from any pair of parents,\n\n10:03.120 --> 10:05.760\n let alone any two random parents on the planet.\n\n10:05.760 --> 10:08.520\n So that's, I think, something that teaches us\n\n10:08.520 --> 10:11.240\n about sort of the nature of humanity in many ways,\n\n10:11.240 --> 10:14.640\n that every one of us is as unique as any star\n\n10:14.640 --> 10:17.160\n and way more unique in actually many ways.\n\n10:17.160 --> 10:22.160\n And yet we're all brothers and sisters.\n\n10:22.160 --> 10:26.160\n Yeah, just like stars, most of it is just fusion reactions.\n\n10:26.160 --> 10:29.280\n Yeah, you only have a few parameters to describe stars.\n\n10:29.280 --> 10:33.120\n Mass, size, initial size, and stage of life.\n\n10:33.120 --> 10:36.360\n Whereas for humans, it's thousands of parameters\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:38.080\n scattered across our genome.\n\n10:38.080 --> 10:41.360\n So the other thing that makes humans unique,\n\n10:41.360 --> 10:45.240\n the other things that makes inheritance unique in humans\n\n10:45.240 --> 10:50.240\n is that most species inherit things vertically.\n\n10:50.360 --> 10:54.480\n Basically instinct is a huge part of their behavior.\n\n10:54.480 --> 10:57.560\n The way that, I mean, with my kids,\n\n10:57.560 --> 11:00.960\n we've been watching this nest of birds\n\n11:00.960 --> 11:03.560\n with two little eggs outside our window\n\n11:03.560 --> 11:05.200\n for the last few months,\n\n11:05.200 --> 11:07.440\n for the last few weeks as they've been growing.\n\n11:07.440 --> 11:12.240\n And there's so much behavior that's hard coded.\n\n11:12.240 --> 11:16.000\n Birds don't just learn as they grow.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.160\n There's no culture.\n\n11:17.160 --> 11:19.480\n Like a bird that's born in Boston\n\n11:19.480 --> 11:22.040\n will be the same as a bird that's born in California.\n\n11:22.040 --> 11:27.040\n So there's not as much inheritance of ideas, of customs.\n\n11:27.920 --> 11:30.520\n A lot of it is hard coding in their genome.\n\n11:30.520 --> 11:32.280\n What's really beautiful about the human genome\n\n11:32.280 --> 11:35.000\n is that if you take a person from today\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.080\n and you place them back in ancient Egypt,\n\n11:37.080 --> 11:39.120\n or if you take a person from ancient Egypt\n\n11:39.120 --> 11:41.160\n and you place them here today,\n\n11:41.160 --> 11:43.200\n they will grow up to be completely normal.\n\n11:44.920 --> 11:47.680\n That is not genetics.\n\n11:47.680 --> 11:51.840\n This is the other type of inheritance in humans.\n\n11:51.840 --> 11:53.880\n So on one hand, we have the genetic inheritance,\n\n11:53.880 --> 11:56.160\n which is vertical from your parents down.\n\n11:56.160 --> 11:58.400\n On the other hand, we have horizontal inheritance,\n\n11:58.400 --> 12:02.400\n which is the ideas that are built up at every generation\n\n12:02.400 --> 12:04.600\n are horizontally transmitted.\n\n12:04.600 --> 12:06.560\n And the huge amount of time\n\n12:06.560 --> 12:09.480\n that we spend in educating ourselves,\n\n12:09.480 --> 12:11.920\n a concept known as neoteny,\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:15.200\n neo for newborn and then teny for holding.\n\n12:15.200 --> 12:17.320\n So if you look at humans,\n\n12:17.320 --> 12:20.400\n I mean, the little birds that were eggs two weeks ago,\n\n12:20.400 --> 12:22.680\n and now one of them has already flown off.\n\n12:22.680 --> 12:24.520\n The other one's ready to fly off.\n\n12:24.520 --> 12:27.280\n In two weeks, they're ready to just fend for themselves.\n\n12:27.280 --> 12:32.280\n Humans, 16 years, 18 years, 24, getting out of college.\n\n12:33.040 --> 12:34.440\n I'm still learning.\n\n12:34.440 --> 12:36.000\n So that's so fascinating,\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.720\n this picture of a vertical and the horizontal.\n\n12:38.720 --> 12:40.080\n When you talk about the horizontal,\n\n12:40.080 --> 12:41.960\n is it in the realm of ideas?\n\n12:41.960 --> 12:42.800\n Exactly.\n\n12:42.800 --> 12:45.320\n Okay, so it's the actual social interactions.\n\n12:45.320 --> 12:46.200\n That's exactly right.\n\n12:46.200 --> 12:47.080\n That's exactly right.\n\n12:47.080 --> 12:49.200\n So basically the concept of neoteny\n\n12:49.200 --> 12:52.760\n is that you spend acquiring characteristics\n\n12:52.760 --> 12:54.160\n from your environment\n\n12:54.160 --> 12:56.960\n in an extremely malleable state of your brain\n\n12:56.960 --> 13:00.640\n and the wiring of your brain for a long period of your life.\n\n13:00.640 --> 13:03.480\n Compared to primates, we are useless.\n\n13:03.480 --> 13:05.320\n You take any primate at seven weeks\n\n13:05.320 --> 13:08.440\n and any human at seven weeks, we lose the battle.\n\n13:08.440 --> 13:11.640\n But at 18 years, you know, all bets are off.\n\n13:11.640 --> 13:14.840\n Like we basically, our brain continues to develop\n\n13:14.840 --> 13:17.760\n in an extremely malleable form till very late.\n\n13:17.760 --> 13:20.360\n And this is what allows education.\n\n13:20.360 --> 13:22.480\n This is what allows the person from Egypt\n\n13:22.480 --> 13:24.680\n to do extremely well now.\n\n13:24.680 --> 13:29.680\n And the reason for that is that the wiring of our brain\n\n13:31.400 --> 13:34.960\n and the development of that wiring is actually delayed.\n\n13:34.960 --> 13:37.480\n So, you know, the longer you delay that,\n\n13:37.480 --> 13:40.840\n the more opportunity you have to pass on knowledge,\n\n13:40.840 --> 13:44.240\n to pass on concepts, ideals, ideas\n\n13:44.240 --> 13:46.080\n from the parents to the child.\n\n13:46.080 --> 13:49.080\n And what's really absolutely beautiful about humans today\n\n13:49.080 --> 13:52.080\n is that that lateral transfer of ideas and culture\n\n13:52.080 --> 13:55.680\n is not just from uncles and aunts and teachers at school,\n\n13:55.680 --> 14:00.280\n but it's from Wikipedia and review articles on the web\n\n14:00.280 --> 14:02.600\n and thousands of journals\n\n14:02.600 --> 14:05.480\n that are sort of putting out information for free\n\n14:05.480 --> 14:08.840\n and podcasts and videocasts and all of that stuff\n\n14:08.840 --> 14:12.840\n where you can basically learn about any topic,\n\n14:12.840 --> 14:16.360\n pretty much everything that would be in any\n\n14:16.360 --> 14:19.520\n super advanced textbook in a matter of days,\n\n14:19.520 --> 14:22.920\n instead of having to go to the library of Alexandria\n\n14:22.920 --> 14:24.720\n and sail there to read three books\n\n14:24.720 --> 14:27.000\n and then sail for another few days to get to Athens\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:28.640\n and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n14:28.640 --> 14:31.360\n So the democratization of knowledge\n\n14:31.360 --> 14:34.280\n and the spread, the speed of spread of knowledge\n\n14:34.280 --> 14:38.920\n is what defines, I think, the human inheritance pattern.\n\n14:38.920 --> 14:43.200\n So you sound excited about it, are you also a little bit\n\n14:43.200 --> 14:46.440\n afraid or are you more excited by the power\n\n14:46.440 --> 14:49.880\n of this kind of distributed spread of information?\n\n14:49.880 --> 14:52.040\n So you put it very kindly that most people\n\n14:52.040 --> 14:55.280\n are kind of using the internet and looking Wikipedia,\n\n14:55.280 --> 14:58.120\n reading articles, reading papers and so on,\n\n14:58.120 --> 15:02.000\n but if we're honest, most people online,\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.200\n especially when they're younger,\n\n15:03.200 --> 15:05.840\n probably looking at five second clips on TikTok\n\n15:05.840 --> 15:08.520\n or whatever the new social network is,\n\n15:08.520 --> 15:12.520\n are you, given this power of horizontal inheritance,\n\n15:12.520 --> 15:16.520\n are you optimistic or a little bit pessimistic\n\n15:16.520 --> 15:21.520\n about this new effect of the internet\n\n15:22.520 --> 15:25.560\n and democratization of knowledge on our,\n\n15:26.960 --> 15:29.400\n what would you call this, this genome,\n\n15:29.400 --> 15:31.880\n would you use the term genome, by the way, for this?\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:36.200\n Yeah, I think we use the genome to talk about DNA,\n\n15:36.200 --> 15:38.960\n but very often we say, I'm Greek,\n\n15:38.960 --> 15:40.760\n so people ask me, hey, what's in the Greek genome?\n\n15:40.760 --> 15:42.800\n And I'm like, well, yeah, what's in the Greek genome\n\n15:42.800 --> 15:44.760\n is both our genes and also our ideas\n\n15:44.760 --> 15:46.640\n and our ideals and our culture.\n\n15:46.640 --> 15:48.240\n So the poetic meaning of the word.\n\n15:48.240 --> 15:50.080\n Exactly, exactly, yeah.\n\n15:50.080 --> 15:55.080\n So I think that there's a beauty\n\n15:55.960 --> 15:57.720\n to the democratization of knowledge,\n\n15:57.720 --> 16:00.200\n the fact that you can reach as many people\n\n16:00.200 --> 16:02.800\n as any other person on the planet\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:04.280\n and it's not who you are,\n\n16:04.280 --> 16:06.640\n it's really your ideas that matter,\n\n16:06.640 --> 16:09.080\n is a beautiful aspect of the internet.\n\n16:11.880 --> 16:15.560\n I think there's, of course, a danger of my ignorance\n\n16:15.560 --> 16:18.240\n is as important as your expertise.\n\n16:18.240 --> 16:21.360\n The fact that with this democratization\n\n16:21.360 --> 16:25.120\n comes the abolishment of respecting expertise.\n\n16:25.120 --> 16:28.880\n Just because you've spent 10,000 hours of your life\n\n16:28.880 --> 16:33.320\n studying, I don't know, human brain circuitry,\n\n16:33.320 --> 16:34.160\n why should I trust you?\n\n16:34.160 --> 16:35.640\n I'm just gonna make up my own theories\n\n16:35.640 --> 16:37.240\n and they'll be just as good as yours,\n\n16:37.240 --> 16:39.640\n is an attitude that sort of counteracts\n\n16:39.640 --> 16:42.480\n the beauty of the democratization.\n\n16:42.480 --> 16:47.400\n And I think that within our educational system\n\n16:47.400 --> 16:49.720\n and within the upbringing of our children,\n\n16:49.720 --> 16:52.320\n we have to not only teach them knowledge,\n\n16:52.320 --> 16:55.760\n but we have to teach them the means to get to knowledge.\n\n16:55.760 --> 16:59.320\n And that, it's very similar to sort of you fish,\n\n16:59.320 --> 17:01.400\n you catch a fish for a man for one day,\n\n17:01.400 --> 17:03.880\n you fed them for one day, you teach them how to fish,\n\n17:03.880 --> 17:05.560\n you fed them for the rest of their life.\n\n17:05.560 --> 17:07.640\n So instead of just gathering the knowledge\n\n17:07.640 --> 17:09.480\n they need for any one task,\n\n17:09.480 --> 17:11.120\n we can just tell them, all right,\n\n17:11.120 --> 17:12.520\n here's how you Google it,\n\n17:12.520 --> 17:14.640\n here's how you figure out what's real and what's not,\n\n17:14.640 --> 17:16.440\n here's how you check the sources,\n\n17:16.440 --> 17:19.200\n here's how you form a basic opinion for yourself.\n\n17:19.200 --> 17:22.880\n And I think that inquisitive nature\n\n17:22.880 --> 17:26.760\n is paramount to being able to sort through\n\n17:26.760 --> 17:29.320\n this huge wealth of knowledge.\n\n17:29.320 --> 17:32.560\n So you need a basic educational foundation\n\n17:32.560 --> 17:35.520\n based on which you can then add on\n\n17:35.520 --> 17:38.200\n the sort of domain specific knowledge,\n\n17:38.200 --> 17:39.720\n but that basic educational foundation\n\n17:39.720 --> 17:42.400\n should just not just be knowledge,\n\n17:42.400 --> 17:45.240\n but it should also be epistemology,\n\n17:45.240 --> 17:47.240\n the way to acquire knowledge.\n\n17:47.240 --> 17:49.720\n I'm not sure any of us know how to do that\n\n17:49.720 --> 17:51.680\n in this modern day, we're actually learning.\n\n17:51.680 --> 17:53.600\n One of the big surprising thing to me\n\n17:53.600 --> 17:57.280\n about the coronavirus, for example,\n\n17:57.280 --> 17:59.680\n is that Twitter has been\n\n17:59.680 --> 18:02.800\n one of the best sources of information.\n\n18:02.800 --> 18:05.860\n Basically like building your own network of experts,\n\n18:07.960 --> 18:11.040\n as opposed to the traditional centralized expertise\n\n18:11.040 --> 18:13.680\n of the WHO and the CDC,\n\n18:13.680 --> 18:18.680\n or maybe any one particular respectable person\n\n18:19.280 --> 18:21.760\n at the top of a department in some kind of institution,\n\n18:21.760 --> 18:26.520\n you instead look at 10, 20, hundreds of people,\n\n18:26.520 --> 18:31.520\n some of whom are young kids that are incredibly good\n\n18:32.600 --> 18:35.800\n at aggregating data and plotting and visualizing that data.\n\n18:35.800 --> 18:37.240\n That's been really surprising to me.\n\n18:37.240 --> 18:38.840\n I don't know what to make of it.\n\n18:39.880 --> 18:44.300\n I don't know how that matures into something stable.\n\n18:45.480 --> 18:47.000\n I don't know if you have ideas.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.960\n If you were to just try to explain to your kids\n\n18:49.960 --> 18:54.960\n of where should you go to learn about coronavirus,\n\n18:54.960 --> 18:56.800\n what would you say?\n\n18:56.800 --> 18:58.080\n It's such a beautiful example.\n\n18:58.080 --> 18:59.920\n And I think the current pandemic\n\n18:59.920 --> 19:03.960\n and the speed at which the scientific community has moved\n\n19:03.960 --> 19:04.780\n in the current pandemic,\n\n19:04.780 --> 19:08.060\n I think exemplifies this horizontal transfer\n\n19:08.060 --> 19:10.820\n and the speed of horizontal transfer of information.\n\n19:10.820 --> 19:15.320\n The fact that the genome was first sequenced\n\n19:15.320 --> 19:16.380\n in early January,\n\n19:16.380 --> 19:20.360\n the first sample was obtained December 29, 2019,\n\n19:20.360 --> 19:23.560\n a week after the publication of the first genome sequence,\n\n19:23.560 --> 19:26.700\n Moderna had already finalized its vaccine design\n\n19:27.800 --> 19:29.500\n and was moving to production.\n\n19:29.500 --> 19:31.820\n I mean, this is phenomenal.\n\n19:31.820 --> 19:34.980\n The fact that we go from not knowing\n\n19:34.980 --> 19:36.740\n what the heck is killing people in Wuhan\n\n19:36.740 --> 19:41.740\n to wow, it's SARS CoV2 and here's the set of genes,\n\n19:41.900 --> 19:43.580\n here's the genome, here's the sequence,\n\n19:43.580 --> 19:45.660\n here are the polymorphisms, et cetera,\n\n19:45.660 --> 19:48.220\n in the matter of weeks is phenomenal.\n\n19:48.220 --> 19:52.760\n In that incredible pace of transfer of knowledge,\n\n19:52.760 --> 19:54.380\n there have been many mistakes.\n\n19:54.380 --> 19:56.620\n So, some of those mistakes\n\n19:56.620 --> 19:57.940\n may have been politically motivated\n\n19:57.940 --> 20:00.860\n or other mistakes may have just been innocuous errors.\n\n20:00.860 --> 20:02.820\n Others may have been misleading the public\n\n20:02.820 --> 20:05.540\n for the greater good, such as don't wear masks\n\n20:05.540 --> 20:07.220\n because we don't want the mask to run out.\n\n20:07.220 --> 20:09.060\n I mean, that was very silly in my view\n\n20:09.060 --> 20:10.440\n and a very big mistake.\n\n20:11.360 --> 20:15.060\n But the spread of knowledge\n\n20:15.060 --> 20:17.300\n from the scientific community was phenomenal.\n\n20:17.300 --> 20:20.680\n And some people will point out to bogus articles\n\n20:20.680 --> 20:22.860\n that snuck in and made the front page.\n\n20:22.860 --> 20:23.700\n Yeah, they did.\n\n20:23.700 --> 20:26.100\n But within 24 hours, they were debunked\n\n20:26.100 --> 20:27.500\n and went out of the front page.\n\n20:27.500 --> 20:30.160\n And I think that's the beauty of science today.\n\n20:30.160 --> 20:33.220\n The fact that it's not, oh, knowledge is fixed.\n\n20:33.220 --> 20:36.980\n It's the ability to embrace that nothing is permanent\n\n20:36.980 --> 20:37.860\n when it comes to knowledge,\n\n20:37.860 --> 20:40.020\n that everything is the current best hypothesis\n\n20:40.020 --> 20:42.900\n and the current best model that best fits the current data\n\n20:42.900 --> 20:45.780\n and the willingness to be wrong.\n\n20:45.780 --> 20:48.260\n The expectation that we're gonna be wrong\n\n20:48.260 --> 20:50.660\n and the celebration of success based on\n\n20:50.660 --> 20:52.700\n how long was I not proven wrong for,\n\n20:52.700 --> 20:55.620\n rather than, wow, I was exactly right.\n\n20:55.620 --> 20:57.020\n Because no one is gonna be exactly right\n\n20:57.020 --> 20:58.940\n with partial knowledge.\n\n20:58.940 --> 21:03.140\n But the arc towards perfection,\n\n21:03.140 --> 21:05.280\n I think is so much more important\n\n21:05.280 --> 21:08.700\n than how far you are in your first step.\n\n21:08.700 --> 21:10.380\n And I think that's what sort of\n\n21:10.380 --> 21:13.420\n the current pandemic has taught us.\n\n21:13.420 --> 21:14.780\n The fact that, yeah, no, of course,\n\n21:14.780 --> 21:16.140\n we're gonna make mistakes,\n\n21:16.140 --> 21:18.300\n but at least we're gonna learn from those mistakes\n\n21:18.300 --> 21:20.340\n and become better and learn better\n\n21:20.340 --> 21:21.340\n and spread information better.\n\n21:21.340 --> 21:23.320\n So if I were to answer the question of,\n\n21:23.320 --> 21:26.460\n where would you go to learn about coronavirus?\n\n21:27.700 --> 21:29.960\n First textbook, it all starts with a textbook.\n\n21:29.960 --> 21:32.580\n Just open up a chapter on virology\n\n21:32.580 --> 21:34.420\n and how coronaviruses work.\n\n21:34.420 --> 21:36.940\n Then some basic epidemiology\n\n21:36.940 --> 21:39.860\n and sort of how pandemics have worked in the past.\n\n21:39.860 --> 21:41.860\n What are the basic principles surrounding\n\n21:41.860 --> 21:43.480\n these first wave, second wave?\n\n21:43.480 --> 21:45.420\n Why do they even exist?\n\n21:45.420 --> 21:47.240\n Then understanding about growth,\n\n21:47.240 --> 21:50.260\n understanding about the R0 and RT\n\n21:50.260 --> 21:52.420\n at various time points.\n\n21:52.420 --> 21:55.260\n And then understanding the means of spread,\n\n21:55.260 --> 21:57.340\n how it spreads from person to person.\n\n21:57.340 --> 22:00.080\n Then how does it get into your cells?\n\n22:00.080 --> 22:01.580\n From when it gets into the cells,\n\n22:01.580 --> 22:03.260\n what are the paths that it takes?\n\n22:03.260 --> 22:05.180\n What are the cell types that express\n\n22:05.180 --> 22:07.300\n the particular ACE2 receptor?\n\n22:07.300 --> 22:09.940\n How is your immune system interacting with the virus?\n\n22:09.940 --> 22:12.300\n And once your immune system launches a defense,\n\n22:12.300 --> 22:15.520\n how is that helping or actually hurting your health?\n\n22:15.520 --> 22:16.920\n What about the cytokine storm?\n\n22:16.920 --> 22:18.560\n What are most people dying from?\n\n22:18.560 --> 22:20.020\n Why are the comorbidities\n\n22:20.020 --> 22:23.900\n and these risk factors even applying?\n\n22:23.900 --> 22:25.940\n What makes obese people respond more\n\n22:25.940 --> 22:28.580\n or elderly people respond more to the virus\n\n22:28.580 --> 22:30.620\n while kids are completely,\n\n22:32.500 --> 22:36.380\n very often not even aware that they're spreading it?\n\n22:36.380 --> 22:41.180\n So I think there's some basic questions\n\n22:41.180 --> 22:42.740\n that you would start from.\n\n22:42.740 --> 22:44.340\n And then I'm sorry to say,\n\n22:44.340 --> 22:45.700\n but Wikipedia is pretty awesome.\n\n22:45.700 --> 22:47.780\n Yeah, it is. Google is pretty awesome.\n\n22:47.780 --> 22:48.620\n It used to be a time,\n\n22:48.620 --> 22:50.500\n it used to be a time maybe five years ago.\n\n22:50.500 --> 22:52.000\n I forget when,\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:54.260\n but people kind of made fun of Wikipedia\n\n22:54.260 --> 22:57.260\n for being an unreliable source.\n\n22:57.260 --> 22:58.500\n I never quite understood it.\n\n22:58.500 --> 23:01.260\n I thought from the early days, it was pretty reliable\n\n23:01.260 --> 23:03.660\n or better than a lot of the alternatives.\n\n23:03.660 --> 23:04.780\n But at this point,\n\n23:04.780 --> 23:08.340\n it's kind of like a solid accessible survey paper\n\n23:08.340 --> 23:10.620\n on every subject ever.\n\n23:10.620 --> 23:14.620\n There's an ascertainment bias and a writing bias.\n\n23:14.620 --> 23:17.820\n So I think this is related to sort of people saying,\n\n23:17.820 --> 23:19.860\n oh, so many nature papers are wrong.\n\n23:20.720 --> 23:22.540\n And they're like, why would you publish in nature?\n\n23:22.540 --> 23:23.680\n So many nature papers are wrong.\n\n23:23.680 --> 23:26.120\n And my answer is no, no, no.\n\n23:26.120 --> 23:29.440\n So many nature papers are scrutinized.\n\n23:29.440 --> 23:31.980\n And just because more of them are being proven wrong\n\n23:31.980 --> 23:35.380\n than in other articles is actually evidence\n\n23:35.380 --> 23:37.060\n that they're actually better papers overall\n\n23:37.060 --> 23:39.140\n because they're being scrutinized at a rate\n\n23:39.140 --> 23:41.040\n much higher than any other journal.\n\n23:41.040 --> 23:45.560\n So if you basically judge Wikipedia\n\n23:45.560 --> 23:49.820\n by not the initial content,\n\n23:49.820 --> 23:52.420\n but by the number of revisions,\n\n23:52.420 --> 23:53.900\n then of course it's gonna be the best source\n\n23:53.900 --> 23:55.300\n of knowledge eventually.\n\n23:55.300 --> 23:57.120\n It's still very superficial.\n\n23:57.120 --> 23:58.780\n You then have to go into the review papers,\n\n23:58.780 --> 24:00.180\n et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n24:00.180 --> 24:03.380\n But I mean, for most scientific topics,\n\n24:03.380 --> 24:05.060\n it's extremely superficial,\n\n24:05.060 --> 24:07.660\n but it is quite authoritative\n\n24:07.660 --> 24:10.780\n because it is the place that everybody likes to criticize\n\n24:10.780 --> 24:11.660\n as being wrong.\n\n24:11.660 --> 24:13.620\n You say that it's superficial.\n\n24:13.620 --> 24:18.340\n And a lot of topics that I've studied a lot of,\n\n24:18.340 --> 24:22.200\n I find it, I don't know if superficial is the right word.\n\n24:24.380 --> 24:27.700\n Because superficial kind of implies that it's not correct.\n\n24:27.700 --> 24:29.100\n No, no, no.\n\n24:29.100 --> 24:31.660\n I don't mean any implication of it not being correct.\n\n24:31.660 --> 24:32.860\n It's just superficial.\n\n24:32.860 --> 24:35.540\n It's basically only scratching the surface.\n\n24:35.540 --> 24:37.140\n For depth, you don't go to Wikipedia.\n\n24:37.140 --> 24:38.340\n You go to the review articles.\n\n24:38.340 --> 24:41.860\n But it can be profound in the way that articles rarely,\n\n24:41.860 --> 24:43.300\n one of the frustrating things to me\n\n24:43.300 --> 24:46.580\n about certain computer science,\n\n24:46.580 --> 24:48.380\n like in the machine learning world,\n\n24:48.380 --> 24:53.380\n articles, they don't as often take the bigger picture view.\n\n24:54.900 --> 24:57.440\n There's a kind of data set and you show that it works\n\n24:57.440 --> 24:59.660\n and you kind of show that here's an architecture thing\n\n24:59.660 --> 25:02.300\n that creates an improvement and so on and so forth.\n\n25:02.300 --> 25:05.300\n But you don't say, well, what does this mean\n\n25:05.300 --> 25:08.580\n for the nature of intelligence for future data sets\n\n25:08.580 --> 25:10.080\n we haven't even thought about?\n\n25:10.080 --> 25:11.940\n Or if you were trying to implement this,\n\n25:11.940 --> 25:15.940\n like if we took this data set of 100,000 examples\n\n25:15.940 --> 25:19.260\n and scale it to 100 billion examples with this method,\n\n25:19.260 --> 25:21.220\n like look at the bigger picture,\n\n25:21.220 --> 25:25.540\n which is what a Wikipedia article would actually try to do,\n\n25:25.540 --> 25:28.540\n which is like, what does this mean in the context\n\n25:28.540 --> 25:32.380\n of the broad field of computer vision or something like that?\n\n25:32.380 --> 25:35.340\n Yeah, no, I agree with you completely, but it depends\n\n25:35.340 --> 25:36.180\n on the topic.\n\n25:36.180 --> 25:38.420\n I mean, for some topics, there's been a huge amount of work.\n\n25:38.420 --> 25:40.300\n For other topics, it's just a stub.\n\n25:40.300 --> 25:41.580\n So, you know.\n\n25:41.580 --> 25:42.420\n I got it.\n\n25:42.420 --> 25:43.240\n Yeah.\n\n25:43.240 --> 25:46.380\n Well, yeah, actually the, which we'll talk on,\n\n25:46.380 --> 25:48.060\n genomics was not great.\n\n25:48.060 --> 25:50.460\n Yeah, it's very shallow, yeah, yeah.\n\n25:50.460 --> 25:51.860\n It's not wrong, it's just shallow.\n\n25:51.860 --> 25:52.700\n It's shallow.\n\n25:52.700 --> 25:54.700\n Yeah, every time I criticize something,\n\n25:54.700 --> 25:56.320\n I should feel partly responsible.\n\n25:56.320 --> 25:58.740\n Basically, if more people from my community went there\n\n25:58.740 --> 26:01.120\n and edited, it would not be shallow.\n\n26:01.120 --> 26:04.020\n It's just that there's different modes of communication\n\n26:04.020 --> 26:05.280\n in different fields.\n\n26:05.280 --> 26:08.980\n And in some fields, the experts have embraced Wikipedia.\n\n26:08.980 --> 26:11.180\n In other fields, it's relegated.\n\n26:11.180 --> 26:15.860\n And perhaps the reason is that if it was any better\n\n26:15.860 --> 26:18.000\n to start with, people would invest more time.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:19.980\n But if it's not great to start with,\n\n26:19.980 --> 26:22.860\n then you need a few initial pioneers who will basically\n\n26:22.860 --> 26:26.460\n go in and say, ah, enough, we're just gonna fix that.\n\n26:26.460 --> 26:29.120\n And then I think it'll catch on much more.\n\n26:29.120 --> 26:32.220\n So if it's okay, before we go on to genomics,\n\n26:32.220 --> 26:35.420\n can we linger a little bit longer on the beauty\n\n26:35.420 --> 26:37.140\n of the human genome?\n\n26:37.140 --> 26:38.580\n You've given me a few notes.\n\n26:38.580 --> 26:41.660\n What else do you find beautiful about the human genome?\n\n26:41.660 --> 26:44.860\n So the last aspect of what makes the human genome unique,\n\n26:44.860 --> 26:49.860\n in addition to the, you know, similarity and the differences\n\n26:49.980 --> 26:54.980\n and the individuality is that, so very early on,\n\n26:56.340 --> 26:58.020\n people would basically say, oh, you don't do that\n\n26:58.020 --> 27:01.260\n experiment in human, you have to learn about that in fly,\n\n27:01.260 --> 27:03.140\n or you have to learn about that in yeast first,\n\n27:03.140 --> 27:05.900\n or in mouse first, or in a primate first.\n\n27:05.900 --> 27:09.040\n And the human genome was in fact relegated to sort of,\n\n27:09.040 --> 27:11.020\n oh, the last place that you're gonna go\n\n27:11.020 --> 27:12.640\n to learn something new.\n\n27:12.640 --> 27:14.220\n That has dramatically changed.\n\n27:14.220 --> 27:17.420\n And the reason that changed is human genetics.\n\n27:18.620 --> 27:22.500\n We are the species in the planet\n\n27:22.500 --> 27:24.660\n that's the most studied right now.\n\n27:24.660 --> 27:26.260\n It's embarrassing to say that,\n\n27:26.260 --> 27:28.380\n but this was not the case a few years ago.\n\n27:28.380 --> 27:33.380\n It used to be, you know, first viruses, then bacteria,\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:37.880\n then yeast, then the fruit fly and the worm,\n\n27:37.880 --> 27:42.420\n then the mouse, and eventually human was very far last.\n\n27:42.420 --> 27:44.740\n So it's embarrassing that it took us this long\n\n27:44.740 --> 27:46.580\n to focus on it, or the...\n\n27:46.580 --> 27:49.220\n It's embarrassing that the model organisms\n\n27:49.220 --> 27:52.660\n have been taken over because of the power of human genetics.\n\n27:52.660 --> 27:55.420\n That right now, it's actually simpler to figure out\n\n27:55.420 --> 27:58.820\n the phenotype of something by mining\n\n27:58.820 --> 28:01.380\n this massive amount of human data\n\n28:01.380 --> 28:04.020\n than by going back to any of the other species.\n\n28:04.020 --> 28:05.540\n And the reason for that is that if you look\n\n28:05.540 --> 28:07.360\n at the natural variation that happens\n\n28:07.360 --> 28:09.700\n in a population of seven billion,\n\n28:09.700 --> 28:13.380\n you basically have a mutation in almost every nucleotide.\n\n28:13.380 --> 28:15.680\n So every nucleotide you wanna perturb,\n\n28:15.680 --> 28:18.780\n you can go find a living, breathing human being\n\n28:18.780 --> 28:20.360\n and go test the function of that nucleotide\n\n28:20.360 --> 28:22.620\n by sort of searching the database and finding that person.\n\n28:22.620 --> 28:23.660\n Wait, why is that embarrassing?\n\n28:23.660 --> 28:24.700\n It's a beautiful data set.\n\n28:24.700 --> 28:26.380\n It's a beautiful data set.\n\n28:26.380 --> 28:29.300\n It's embarrassing for the model organism.\n\n28:29.300 --> 28:30.140\n For the flies.\n\n28:30.140 --> 28:30.980\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n28:30.980 --> 28:34.940\n I mean, do you feel on a small tangent,\n\n28:34.940 --> 28:39.940\n is there something of value in the genome of a fly\n\n28:40.060 --> 28:43.740\n and other of these model organisms that you miss\n\n28:43.740 --> 28:47.420\n that we wish we would be looking at deeper?\n\n28:47.420 --> 28:49.900\n So directed perturbation, of course.\n\n28:49.900 --> 28:54.140\n So I think the place where humans are still lagging\n\n28:54.140 --> 28:55.700\n is the fact that in an animal model,\n\n28:55.700 --> 28:56.540\n you can go and say,\n\n28:56.540 --> 28:58.620\n well, let me knock out this gene completely\n\n28:58.620 --> 29:00.580\n and let me knock out these three genes completely.\n\n29:00.580 --> 29:02.780\n And the moment you get into combinatorics,\n\n29:02.780 --> 29:04.180\n it's something you can't do in the human\n\n29:04.180 --> 29:05.980\n because there just simply aren't enough humans\n\n29:05.980 --> 29:07.060\n on the planet.\n\n29:07.060 --> 29:08.820\n And again, let me be honest,\n\n29:08.820 --> 29:11.180\n we haven't sequenced all seven billion people.\n\n29:11.180 --> 29:12.820\n It's not like we have every mutation,\n\n29:12.820 --> 29:15.060\n but we know that there's a carrier out there.\n\n29:15.060 --> 29:17.500\n So if you look at the trend and the speed\n\n29:17.500 --> 29:19.460\n with which human genetics has progressed,\n\n29:19.460 --> 29:23.300\n we can now find thousands of genes involved\n\n29:23.300 --> 29:27.060\n in human cognition, in human psychology,\n\n29:27.060 --> 29:29.100\n in the emotions and the feelings\n\n29:29.100 --> 29:31.780\n that we used to think are uniquely learned.\n\n29:31.780 --> 29:34.380\n It turns out there's a genetic basis to a lot of that.\n\n29:34.380 --> 29:39.380\n So the human genome has continued to elucidate\n\n29:42.540 --> 29:44.860\n through these studies of genetic variation,\n\n29:44.860 --> 29:47.500\n so many different processes that we previously thought\n\n29:47.500 --> 29:52.300\n were something like free will.\n\n29:52.300 --> 29:54.260\n Free will is this beautiful concept\n\n29:54.260 --> 29:56.740\n that humans have had for a long time.\n\n29:58.060 --> 29:59.860\n In the end, it's just a bunch of chemical reactions\n\n29:59.860 --> 30:00.740\n happening in your brain.\n\n30:00.740 --> 30:03.140\n And the particular abundance of receptors\n\n30:03.140 --> 30:06.100\n that you have this day based on what you ate yesterday\n\n30:06.100 --> 30:10.380\n or that you have been wired with based on your parents\n\n30:10.380 --> 30:12.580\n and your upbringing, et cetera,\n\n30:12.580 --> 30:15.700\n determines a lot of that quote unquote free will component\n\n30:15.700 --> 30:20.700\n to sort of narrow and narrow sort of slices.\n\n30:20.700 --> 30:24.140\n So how much on that point, how much freedom\n\n30:24.140 --> 30:29.020\n do you think we have to escape the constraints\n\n30:29.020 --> 30:30.420\n of our genome?\n\n30:30.420 --> 30:31.980\n You're making it sound like more and more\n\n30:31.980 --> 30:35.060\n we're discovering that our genome is actually has the,\n\n30:35.060 --> 30:37.740\n a lot of the story already encoded into it.\n\n30:37.740 --> 30:39.580\n How much freedom do we have?\n\n30:39.580 --> 30:44.580\n I, so let me describe what that freedom would look like.\n\n30:45.140 --> 30:47.620\n That freedom would be my saying,\n\n30:47.620 --> 30:51.540\n ooh, I'm gonna resist the urge to eat that apple\n\n30:51.540 --> 30:53.220\n because I choose not to.\n\n30:54.500 --> 30:57.620\n But there are chemical receptors that made me\n\n30:57.620 --> 31:01.340\n not resist the urge to prove my individuality\n\n31:01.340 --> 31:04.100\n and my free will by resisting the apple.\n\n31:04.100 --> 31:05.580\n So then the next question is,\n\n31:05.580 --> 31:08.220\n well, maybe now I'll resist the urge to resist the apple\n\n31:08.220 --> 31:09.540\n and I'll go for the chocolate instead\n\n31:09.540 --> 31:10.780\n to prove my individuality.\n\n31:10.780 --> 31:14.460\n But then what about those other receptors that, you know?\n\n31:14.460 --> 31:17.780\n That might be all encoded in there.\n\n31:17.780 --> 31:19.460\n So it's kicking the bucket down the road\n\n31:19.460 --> 31:22.020\n and basically saying, well, your choice\n\n31:22.020 --> 31:24.900\n will may have actually been driven by other things\n\n31:24.900 --> 31:26.660\n that you actually are not choosing.\n\n31:27.860 --> 31:30.020\n So that's why it's very hard to answer that question.\n\n31:30.020 --> 31:31.420\n It's hard to know what to do with that.\n\n31:31.420 --> 31:33.340\n I mean, if the genome has,\n\n31:35.820 --> 31:38.500\n if there's not much freedom, it's a...\n\n31:38.500 --> 31:40.500\n It's the butterfly effect.\n\n31:40.500 --> 31:42.900\n It's basically that in the short term,\n\n31:42.900 --> 31:45.700\n you can predict something extremely well\n\n31:45.700 --> 31:48.100\n by knowing the current state of the system.\n\n31:48.100 --> 31:50.700\n But a few steps down, it's very hard to predict\n\n31:50.700 --> 31:52.380\n based on the current knowledge.\n\n31:52.380 --> 31:55.220\n Is that because the system is truly free?\n\n31:55.220 --> 31:56.340\n When I look at weather patterns,\n\n31:56.340 --> 31:57.860\n I can predict the next 10 days.\n\n31:57.860 --> 32:00.260\n Is it because the weather has a lot of freedom\n\n32:00.260 --> 32:03.420\n and after 10 days it chooses to do something else?\n\n32:03.420 --> 32:07.300\n Or is it because in fact the system is fully deterministic\n\n32:07.300 --> 32:10.100\n and there's just a slightly different magnetic field\n\n32:10.100 --> 32:12.420\n of the earth, slightly more energy arriving from the sun,\n\n32:12.420 --> 32:15.140\n a slightly different spin of the gravitational pull\n\n32:15.140 --> 32:18.860\n of Jupiter that is now causing all kinds of tides\n\n32:18.860 --> 32:20.860\n and slight deviation of the moon, et cetera.\n\n32:20.860 --> 32:22.940\n Maybe all of that can be fully modeled.\n\n32:22.940 --> 32:25.740\n Maybe the fact that China is emitting\n\n32:25.740 --> 32:28.180\n a little more carbon today is actually gonna affect\n\n32:28.180 --> 32:31.460\n the weather in Egypt in three weeks.\n\n32:31.460 --> 32:33.860\n And all of that could be fully modeled.\n\n32:33.860 --> 32:36.780\n In the same way, if you take a complete view\n\n32:36.780 --> 32:42.700\n of a human being now, I model everything about you.\n\n32:42.700 --> 32:44.860\n The question is, can I predict your next step?\n\n32:44.860 --> 32:47.740\n Probably, but at how far?\n\n32:47.740 --> 32:51.260\n And if it's a little further, is that because of stochasticity\n\n32:51.260 --> 32:54.580\n and sort of chaos properties of unpredictability\n\n32:54.580 --> 32:56.100\n of beyond a certain level?\n\n32:56.100 --> 32:58.260\n Or was that actually true free will?\n\n32:58.260 --> 33:01.260\n Yeah, so the number of variables might be so,\n\n33:01.260 --> 33:05.260\n you might need to build an entire universe to be able to model.\n\n33:05.260 --> 33:07.740\n To simulate a human, and then maybe that human\n\n33:07.740 --> 33:09.420\n will be fully simulatable.\n\n33:09.420 --> 33:12.220\n But maybe aspects of free will will exist.\n\n33:12.220 --> 33:13.380\n And where's that free will coming from?\n\n33:13.380 --> 33:14.980\n It's still coming from the same neurons\n\n33:14.980 --> 33:17.580\n or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these neurons.\n\n33:17.580 --> 33:19.740\n But again, it's very difficult empirically\n\n33:19.740 --> 33:22.540\n to sort of evaluate where does free will begin\n\n33:22.540 --> 33:26.700\n and sort of chemical reactions and electric signals.\n\n33:26.700 --> 33:31.140\n So on that topic, let me ask the most absurd question\n\n33:31.140 --> 33:33.900\n that most MIT faculty rolled their eyes on.\n\n33:33.900 --> 33:38.260\n But what do you think about the simulation hypothesis\n\n33:38.260 --> 33:40.220\n and the idea that we live in a simulation?\n\n33:40.220 --> 33:41.580\n I think it's complete BS.\n\n33:41.580 --> 33:44.540\n Okay.\n\n33:44.540 --> 33:45.740\n There's no empirical evidence.\n\n33:45.740 --> 33:47.060\n No, it's not. Absolutely not.\n\n33:47.060 --> 33:49.020\n Not in terms of empirical evidence or not,\n\n33:49.020 --> 33:52.380\n but in terms of a thought experiment,\n\n33:52.380 --> 33:54.860\n does it help you think about the universe?\n\n33:54.860 --> 33:57.500\n I mean, so if you look at the genome,\n\n33:57.500 --> 33:59.180\n it's encoding a lot of the information\n\n33:59.180 --> 34:01.500\n that is required to create some of the beautiful\n\n34:01.500 --> 34:04.220\n human complexity that we see around us.\n\n34:04.220 --> 34:05.940\n It's an interesting thought experiment.\n\n34:05.940 --> 34:10.940\n How much parameters do we need to have\n\n34:11.340 --> 34:15.300\n in order to model this full human experience?\n\n34:15.300 --> 34:17.540\n Like if we were to build a video game,\n\n34:17.540 --> 34:19.980\n how hard it would be to build a video game\n\n34:19.980 --> 34:22.660\n that's like convincing enough and fun enough\n\n34:22.660 --> 34:27.660\n and it has consistent laws of physics, all that stuff.\n\n34:28.340 --> 34:31.380\n It's not interesting to use a thought experiment.\n\n34:31.380 --> 34:35.060\n I mean, it's cute, but it's Occam's razor.\n\n34:35.060 --> 34:36.820\n I mean, what's more realistic,\n\n34:36.820 --> 34:38.340\n the fact that you're actually a machine\n\n34:38.340 --> 34:39.740\n or that you're a person?\n\n34:39.740 --> 34:43.340\n What's the fact that all of my experiences exist\n\n34:43.340 --> 34:45.540\n inside the chemical molecules that I have\n\n34:45.540 --> 34:49.540\n or that somebody is actually simulating all that?\n\n34:49.540 --> 34:50.860\n Well, you did refer to humans\n\n34:50.860 --> 34:52.540\n as a digital computer earlier.\n\n34:52.540 --> 34:53.420\n Of course, of course.\n\n34:53.420 --> 34:54.260\n But that does not.\n\n34:54.260 --> 34:55.300\n It's a kind of a machine, right?\n\n34:55.300 --> 34:56.380\n I know, I know.\n\n34:56.380 --> 35:01.380\n But I think the probability of all that is nil\n\n35:01.740 --> 35:03.500\n and let the machines wake me up\n\n35:03.500 --> 35:05.540\n and just terminate me now if it's not.\n\n35:07.540 --> 35:08.860\n I challenge you machines.\n\n35:08.860 --> 35:10.940\n They're gonna wait a little bit\n\n35:10.940 --> 35:12.380\n to see what you're gonna do next.\n\n35:12.380 --> 35:13.220\n It's fun.\n\n35:13.220 --> 35:16.300\n It's fun to watch, especially the clever humans.\n\n35:17.380 --> 35:18.540\n What's the difference to you\n\n35:18.540 --> 35:21.300\n between the way a computer stores information\n\n35:21.300 --> 35:24.020\n and the human genome stores information?\n\n35:24.020 --> 35:27.020\n So you also have roots and your work.\n\n35:27.020 --> 35:30.660\n Would you say when you introduce yourself at a bar.\n\n35:31.980 --> 35:34.020\n It depends who I'm talking to.\n\n35:34.020 --> 35:36.180\n Would you say it's computational biology?\n\n35:36.180 --> 35:41.180\n Do you reveal your expertise in computers?\n\n35:43.300 --> 35:45.340\n It depends who I'm talking to, truly.\n\n35:45.340 --> 35:47.700\n I mean, basically, if I meet someone who's in computers,\n\n35:47.700 --> 35:51.100\n I'll say, oh, I'm a professor in computer science.\n\n35:51.100 --> 35:52.500\n If I meet someone who's in engineering,\n\n35:52.500 --> 35:54.780\n I say computer science and electrical engineering.\n\n35:54.780 --> 35:55.980\n If I meet someone in biology,\n\n35:55.980 --> 35:57.220\n I'll say, hey, I work in genomics.\n\n35:57.220 --> 35:58.300\n If I meet someone in medicine,\n\n35:58.300 --> 36:00.740\n I'm like, hey, I work on genetics.\n\n36:00.740 --> 36:02.220\n So you're a fun person to meet at a bar.\n\n36:02.220 --> 36:03.940\n I got you, but so.\n\n36:03.940 --> 36:07.460\n No, no, but what I'm trying to say is that I don't,\n\n36:07.460 --> 36:09.100\n I mean, there's no single attribute\n\n36:09.100 --> 36:11.140\n that I will define myself as.\n\n36:11.140 --> 36:12.140\n There's a few things I know.\n\n36:12.140 --> 36:13.140\n There's a few things I study.\n\n36:13.140 --> 36:15.100\n There's a few things I have degrees on\n\n36:15.100 --> 36:17.980\n and there's a few things that I grant degrees in.\n\n36:17.980 --> 36:22.900\n And I publish papers across the whole gamut,\n\n36:22.900 --> 36:26.380\n the whole spectrum of computation to biology, et cetera.\n\n36:26.380 --> 36:31.380\n I mean, the complete answer is that I use computer science\n\n36:31.580 --> 36:32.900\n to understand biology.\n\n36:34.180 --> 36:39.180\n So I develop methods in AI and machine learning,\n\n36:39.460 --> 36:41.700\n statistics and algorithms, et cetera.\n\n36:41.700 --> 36:44.060\n But the ultimate goal of my career\n\n36:44.060 --> 36:45.700\n is to really understand biology.\n\n36:45.700 --> 36:47.780\n If these things don't advance our understanding\n\n36:47.780 --> 36:51.980\n of biology, I'm not as fascinated by them.\n\n36:51.980 --> 36:54.940\n Although there are some beautiful computational problems\n\n36:54.940 --> 36:57.940\n by themselves, I've sort of made it my mission\n\n36:57.940 --> 37:01.660\n to apply the power of computer science\n\n37:01.660 --> 37:06.660\n to truly understand the human genome, health, disease,\n\n37:07.500 --> 37:10.100\n and the whole gamut of how our brain works,\n\n37:10.100 --> 37:11.740\n how our body works and all of that,\n\n37:11.740 --> 37:13.980\n which is so fascinating.\n\n37:13.980 --> 37:16.940\n And so the dream, there's not an equivalent\n\n37:16.940 --> 37:20.940\n sort of complimentary dream of understanding\n\n37:20.940 --> 37:23.340\n human biology in order to create an artificial life\n\n37:23.340 --> 37:26.060\n or an artificial brain or artificial intelligence\n\n37:26.060 --> 37:27.660\n that supersedes the intelligence\n\n37:27.660 --> 37:29.660\n and the capabilities of us humans.\n\n37:30.740 --> 37:31.860\n It's an interesting question.\n\n37:31.860 --> 37:33.260\n It's a fascinating question.\n\n37:33.260 --> 37:38.260\n So understanding the human brain is undoubtedly coupled\n\n37:39.740 --> 37:42.180\n to how do we make better AI?\n\n37:42.180 --> 37:46.420\n Because so much of AI has in fact been inspired\n\n37:46.420 --> 37:47.260\n by the brain.\n\n37:47.260 --> 37:49.060\n It may have taken 50 years\n\n37:49.060 --> 37:51.140\n since the early days of neural networks\n\n37:51.140 --> 37:55.420\n till we have all of these amazing progress\n\n37:55.420 --> 38:00.420\n that we've seen with deep belief networks\n\n38:00.820 --> 38:05.820\n and all of these advances in Go, in Chess,\n\n38:06.460 --> 38:10.420\n in image synthesis, in deep fakes, in you name it.\n\n38:10.420 --> 38:15.420\n But the underlying architecture is very much inspired\n\n38:17.020 --> 38:18.060\n by the human brain,\n\n38:18.060 --> 38:20.900\n which actually posits a very, very interesting question.\n\n38:22.580 --> 38:26.340\n Why are neural networks performing so well?\n\n38:27.220 --> 38:28.980\n And they perform amazingly well.\n\n38:28.980 --> 38:31.740\n Is it because they can simulate any possible function?\n\n38:32.580 --> 38:34.420\n And the answer is no, no.\n\n38:34.420 --> 38:37.180\n They simulate a very small number of functions.\n\n38:37.180 --> 38:39.420\n Is it because they can simulate every function\n\n38:39.420 --> 38:40.500\n in the universe?\n\n38:40.500 --> 38:41.540\n And that's where it gets interesting.\n\n38:41.540 --> 38:44.740\n The answer is actually, yeah, a little closer to that.\n\n38:44.740 --> 38:46.580\n And here's where it gets really fun.\n\n38:47.700 --> 38:51.700\n If you look at human brain and human cognition,\n\n38:51.700 --> 38:53.980\n it didn't evolve in a vacuum.\n\n38:53.980 --> 38:57.620\n It evolved in a world with physical constraints,\n\n38:58.780 --> 39:00.700\n like the world that inhabits us.\n\n39:00.700 --> 39:02.300\n It is the world that we inhabit.\n\n39:03.220 --> 39:08.220\n And if you look at our senses, what do they perceive?\n\n39:08.220 --> 39:12.020\n They perceive different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n39:13.220 --> 39:17.260\n The hearing is just different movements in air,\n\n39:17.260 --> 39:18.820\n the touch, et cetera.\n\n39:18.820 --> 39:20.100\n I mean, all of these things,\n\n39:20.100 --> 39:22.700\n we've built intuitions for the physical world\n\n39:22.700 --> 39:23.980\n that we inhabit.\n\n39:23.980 --> 39:27.660\n And our brains and the brains of all animals evolved\n\n39:27.660 --> 39:29.140\n for that world.\n\n39:29.140 --> 39:32.660\n And the AI systems that we have built\n\n39:32.660 --> 39:34.700\n happen to work well with images\n\n39:34.700 --> 39:36.100\n of the type that we encounter\n\n39:36.100 --> 39:38.380\n in the physical world that we inhabit.\n\n39:38.380 --> 39:42.420\n Whereas if you just take noise and you add random signal\n\n39:42.420 --> 39:44.420\n that doesn't match anything in our world,\n\n39:44.420 --> 39:46.940\n neural networks will not do as well.\n\n39:46.940 --> 39:51.940\n And that actually basically has this whole loop around this,\n\n39:52.900 --> 39:57.620\n which is this was designed by studying our own brain,\n\n39:57.620 --> 39:59.580\n which was evolved for our own world.\n\n39:59.580 --> 40:01.940\n And they happen to do well in our own world.\n\n40:01.940 --> 40:04.140\n And they happen to make the same types of mistakes\n\n40:04.140 --> 40:07.020\n that humans make many times.\n\n40:07.020 --> 40:08.740\n And of course you can engineer images\n\n40:08.740 --> 40:12.580\n by adding just the right amount of sort of pixel deviations\n\n40:12.580 --> 40:15.780\n to make a zebra look like a bamboo and stuff like that,\n\n40:15.780 --> 40:17.060\n or like a table.\n\n40:18.380 --> 40:22.700\n But ultimately the undoctored images at least\n\n40:23.580 --> 40:25.940\n are very often mistaken, I don't know,\n\n40:25.940 --> 40:28.860\n between muffins and dogs, for example,\n\n40:28.860 --> 40:31.220\n in the same way that humans make those mistakes.\n\n40:31.220 --> 40:35.820\n So there's no doubt in my view\n\n40:35.820 --> 40:38.580\n that the more we understand about the tricks\n\n40:38.580 --> 40:40.580\n that our human brain has evolved\n\n40:40.580 --> 40:42.900\n to understand the physical world around us,\n\n40:42.900 --> 40:44.740\n the more we will be able to bring\n\n40:44.740 --> 40:48.780\n new computational primitives in our AI systems\n\n40:48.780 --> 40:52.220\n to again better understand not just the world around us,\n\n40:52.220 --> 40:54.460\n but maybe even the world inside us,\n\n40:54.460 --> 40:57.180\n and maybe even the computational problems that arise\n\n40:57.180 --> 41:00.380\n from new types of data that we haven't been exposed to,\n\n41:00.380 --> 41:03.460\n but are yet inhabiting the same universe that we live in\n\n41:03.460 --> 41:06.100\n with a very tiny little subset of functions\n\n41:06.100 --> 41:08.140\n from all possible mathematical functions.\n\n41:08.140 --> 41:10.220\n Yeah, and that small subset of functions,\n\n41:10.220 --> 41:12.940\n all that matters to us humans really, that's what makes.\n\n41:12.940 --> 41:14.860\n It's all that has mattered so far.\n\n41:14.860 --> 41:17.100\n And even within our scientific realm,\n\n41:17.100 --> 41:19.740\n it's all that seems to continue to matter.\n\n41:19.740 --> 41:24.740\n But I mean, I always like to think about our senses\n\n41:24.860 --> 41:29.380\n and how much of the physical world around us we perceive.\n\n41:29.380 --> 41:34.380\n And if you look at the LIGO experiment\n\n41:35.020 --> 41:38.220\n over the last year and a half has been all over the news.\n\n41:38.220 --> 41:39.660\n What did LIGO do?\n\n41:39.660 --> 41:42.940\n It created a new sense for human beings,\n\n41:42.940 --> 41:45.820\n a sense that has never been sensed\n\n41:45.820 --> 41:47.300\n in the history of our planet.\n\n41:48.980 --> 41:51.620\n Gravitational waves have been traversing the earth\n\n41:53.020 --> 41:55.220\n since its creation a few billion years ago.\n\n41:55.220 --> 41:59.580\n Life has evolved senses to sense things\n\n41:59.580 --> 42:01.260\n that were never before sensed.\n\n42:02.220 --> 42:05.780\n Light was not perceived by early life.\n\n42:05.780 --> 42:06.620\n No one cared.\n\n42:07.580 --> 42:11.260\n And eventually photoreceptors evolved\n\n42:11.260 --> 42:14.220\n and the ability to sense colors\n\n42:14.220 --> 42:16.060\n by sort of catching different parts\n\n42:16.060 --> 42:19.140\n of that electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n42:19.140 --> 42:23.380\n And hearing evolved and touch evolved, et cetera.\n\n42:23.380 --> 42:27.700\n But no organism evolved a way to sense neutrinos\n\n42:27.700 --> 42:29.940\n floating through earth or gravitational waves\n\n42:29.940 --> 42:31.260\n flowing through earth, et cetera.\n\n42:31.260 --> 42:33.860\n And I find it so beautiful in the history\n\n42:33.860 --> 42:37.020\n of not just humanity, but life on the planet\n\n42:37.020 --> 42:40.460\n that we are now able to capture additional signals\n\n42:40.460 --> 42:43.620\n from the physical world than we ever knew before.\n\n42:43.620 --> 42:46.340\n And axions, for example, have been all over the news\n\n42:46.340 --> 42:47.460\n in the last few weeks.\n\n42:47.460 --> 42:52.460\n And the concept that we can capture and perceive\n\n42:53.580 --> 42:57.660\n more of that physical world is as exciting\n\n42:57.660 --> 43:01.980\n as the fact that we were blind to it\n\n43:01.980 --> 43:04.620\n is traumatizing before.\n\n43:04.620 --> 43:08.260\n Because that also tells us, you know, we're in 2020.\n\n43:09.380 --> 43:12.820\n Picture yourself in 3020 or in 20, you know.\n\n43:12.820 --> 43:15.580\n What new senses might we discover?\n\n43:15.580 --> 43:19.580\n Is it, you know, could it be that we're missing\n\n43:19.580 --> 43:21.900\n nine tenths of physics?\n\n43:21.900 --> 43:23.980\n That like, there's a lot of physics out there\n\n43:23.980 --> 43:27.900\n that we're just blind to, completely oblivious to it.\n\n43:27.900 --> 43:29.340\n And yet they're permeating us all the time.\n\n43:29.340 --> 43:31.140\n Yeah, so it might be right in front of us.\n\n43:31.140 --> 43:34.220\n So when you're thinking about premonitions,\n\n43:35.060 --> 43:37.580\n yeah, a lot of that is ascertainment bias.\n\n43:37.580 --> 43:39.420\n Like, yeah, you know, every now and then you're like,\n\n43:39.420 --> 43:41.020\n oh, I remember my friend.\n\n43:41.020 --> 43:42.660\n And then my friend doesn't appear\n\n43:42.660 --> 43:44.540\n and I'll forget that I remembered my friend.\n\n43:44.540 --> 43:45.980\n But every now and then my friend will actually appear.\n\n43:45.980 --> 43:48.340\n I'm like, oh my God, I thought about you a minute ago.\n\n43:48.340 --> 43:50.140\n You just called me, that's amazing.\n\n43:50.140 --> 43:51.980\n So, you know, some of that is this,\n\n43:51.980 --> 43:55.060\n but some of that might be that there are,\n\n43:55.060 --> 43:59.900\n within our brain, sensors for waves\n\n43:59.900 --> 44:02.260\n that we emit that we're not even aware of.\n\n44:03.220 --> 44:07.020\n And this whole concept of when I hug my children,\n\n44:07.020 --> 44:10.460\n there's such an emotional transfer there\n\n44:10.460 --> 44:12.220\n that we don't comprehend.\n\n44:12.220 --> 44:15.100\n I mean, sure, yeah, of course we're all like hard wire\n\n44:15.100 --> 44:16.700\n for all kinds of touchy feely things\n\n44:16.700 --> 44:18.220\n between parents and kids, it's beautiful,\n\n44:18.220 --> 44:20.660\n between partners, it's beautiful, et cetera.\n\n44:20.660 --> 44:24.900\n But then there are intangible aspects\n\n44:24.900 --> 44:27.340\n of human communication\n\n44:27.340 --> 44:30.020\n that I don't think it's unfathomable\n\n44:30.020 --> 44:32.060\n that our brain has actually evolved waves and sensors\n\n44:32.060 --> 44:33.940\n for it that we just don't capture.\n\n44:33.940 --> 44:35.220\n We don't understand the function\n\n44:35.220 --> 44:37.420\n of the vast majority of our neurons.\n\n44:37.420 --> 44:40.100\n And maybe our brain is already sensing it,\n\n44:40.100 --> 44:43.940\n but even worse, maybe our brain is not sensing it at all.\n\n44:43.940 --> 44:46.620\n And we're oblivious to this until we build a machine\n\n44:46.620 --> 44:48.300\n that suddenly is able to sort of capture\n\n44:48.300 --> 44:50.340\n so much more of what's happening in the natural world.\n\n44:50.340 --> 44:52.620\n So what you're saying is physics\n\n44:52.620 --> 44:54.780\n is going to discover a sensor for love.\n\n44:57.220 --> 45:00.220\n And maybe dogs are off scale for that.\n\n45:01.460 --> 45:04.140\n And we've been oblivious to it the whole time\n\n45:04.140 --> 45:05.740\n because we didn't have the right sensor.\n\n45:05.740 --> 45:07.420\n And now you're gonna have a little wrist that says,\n\n45:07.420 --> 45:09.660\n oh my God, I feel all this love in the house.\n\n45:09.660 --> 45:11.860\n I sense a disturbance in the forest.\n\n45:11.860 --> 45:13.660\n It's all around us.\n\n45:13.660 --> 45:15.780\n And dogs and cats will have zero.\n\n45:15.780 --> 45:17.020\n None. None.\n\n45:17.020 --> 45:17.860\n It's just.\n\n45:17.860 --> 45:18.700\n Oh, no signal.\n\n45:20.100 --> 45:24.540\n But let's take a step back to our unfortunate place.\n\n45:24.540 --> 45:27.220\n To one of the 400 topics that we had actually planned for.\n\n45:29.580 --> 45:31.820\n But to our sad time in 2020\n\n45:31.820 --> 45:33.860\n when we only have just a few sensors\n\n45:33.860 --> 45:37.620\n and very primitive early computers.\n\n45:37.620 --> 45:41.820\n So you have a foot in computer science\n\n45:41.820 --> 45:43.500\n and a foot in biology.\n\n45:43.500 --> 45:48.300\n In your sense, how do computers represent information\n\n45:48.300 --> 45:52.300\n differently than like the genome or biological systems?\n\n45:52.300 --> 45:55.540\n So first of all, let me correct\n\n45:55.540 --> 45:58.180\n that no, we're in an amazing time in 2020.\n\n46:00.340 --> 46:02.460\n Computer science is totally awesome.\n\n46:02.460 --> 46:03.980\n And physics is totally awesome.\n\n46:03.980 --> 46:06.900\n And we have understood so much of the natural world\n\n46:06.900 --> 46:08.500\n than ever before.\n\n46:08.500 --> 46:13.140\n So I am extremely grateful and feeling extremely lucky\n\n46:13.140 --> 46:16.180\n to be living in the time that we are.\n\n46:16.180 --> 46:17.540\n Cause you know, first of all,\n\n46:17.540 --> 46:20.140\n who knows when the asteroid will hit.\n\n46:20.140 --> 46:25.140\n And second, you know, of all times in humanity,\n\n46:26.140 --> 46:29.380\n this is probably the best time to be a human being.\n\n46:29.380 --> 46:31.100\n And this might actually be the best place\n\n46:31.100 --> 46:31.940\n to be a human being.\n\n46:31.940 --> 46:34.420\n So anyway, you know, for anyone who loves science,\n\n46:34.420 --> 46:35.260\n this is it.\n\n46:35.260 --> 46:36.100\n This is awesome.\n\n46:36.100 --> 46:36.940\n This is a great time.\n\n46:36.940 --> 46:39.300\n At the same time, just a quick comment.\n\n46:39.300 --> 46:43.060\n All I meant is that if we look several hundred years\n\n46:43.060 --> 46:48.060\n from now and we end up somehow not destroying ourselves,\n\n46:48.500 --> 46:50.300\n people will probably look back at this time\n\n46:50.300 --> 46:55.300\n in computer science and at your work of Manos at MIT.\n\n46:55.620 --> 46:56.580\n As infantile.\n\n46:56.580 --> 46:59.620\n As infantile and silly and how ignorant it all was.\n\n46:59.620 --> 47:02.500\n I like to joke very often with my students\n\n47:02.500 --> 47:04.220\n that, you know, we've written so many papers.\n\n47:04.220 --> 47:05.260\n We've published so much.\n\n47:05.260 --> 47:06.460\n We've been citing so much.\n\n47:06.460 --> 47:08.380\n And every single time I tell my students, you know,\n\n47:08.380 --> 47:09.700\n the best is ahead of us.\n\n47:09.700 --> 47:11.380\n What we're working on now\n\n47:11.380 --> 47:13.860\n is the most exciting thing I've ever worked on.\n\n47:13.860 --> 47:16.420\n So in a way, I do have this sense of, yeah,\n\n47:16.420 --> 47:18.540\n even the papers I wrote 10 years ago,\n\n47:18.540 --> 47:20.300\n they were awesome at the time,\n\n47:20.300 --> 47:22.380\n but I'm so much more excited about where we're heading now.\n\n47:22.380 --> 47:24.500\n And I don't mean to minimize any of the stuff\n\n47:24.500 --> 47:25.460\n we've done in the past,\n\n47:25.460 --> 47:29.020\n but you know, there's just this sense of excitement\n\n47:29.020 --> 47:30.980\n about what you're working on now\n\n47:30.980 --> 47:33.380\n that as soon as a paper is submitted,\n\n47:33.380 --> 47:35.540\n it's like, ugh, it's old.\n\n47:35.540 --> 47:37.140\n You know, I can't talk about that anymore.\n\n47:37.140 --> 47:37.980\n I'm not gonna talk about it.\n\n47:37.980 --> 47:38.820\n At the same time, you're not,\n\n47:38.820 --> 47:41.340\n you probably are not going to be able to predict\n\n47:41.340 --> 47:45.500\n what are the most impactful papers and ideas\n\n47:45.500 --> 47:47.860\n when people look back 200 years from now at your work,\n\n47:47.860 --> 47:50.740\n what would be the most exciting papers.\n\n47:50.740 --> 47:54.220\n And it may very well be not the thing that you expected.\n\n47:54.220 --> 47:58.100\n Or the things you got awards for or, you know.\n\n47:58.100 --> 47:59.980\n This might be true in some fields.\n\n47:59.980 --> 48:00.820\n I don't know.\n\n48:00.820 --> 48:02.340\n I feel slightly differently about it in our field.\n\n48:02.340 --> 48:05.660\n I feel that I kind of know what are the important ones.\n\n48:05.660 --> 48:07.300\n And there's a very big difference\n\n48:07.300 --> 48:09.180\n between what the press picks up on\n\n48:09.180 --> 48:11.620\n and what's actually fundamentally important for the field.\n\n48:11.620 --> 48:13.380\n And I think for the fundamentally important ones,\n\n48:13.380 --> 48:15.580\n we kind of have a pretty good idea what they are.\n\n48:15.580 --> 48:18.140\n And it's hard to sometimes get the press excited\n\n48:18.140 --> 48:20.100\n about the fundamental advances,\n\n48:20.100 --> 48:23.700\n but you know, we take what we get\n\n48:23.700 --> 48:24.740\n and celebrate what we get.\n\n48:24.740 --> 48:27.180\n And sometimes, you know, one of our papers,\n\n48:27.180 --> 48:28.500\n which was in a minor journal,\n\n48:28.500 --> 48:30.180\n made the front page of Reddit\n\n48:30.180 --> 48:33.500\n and suddenly had like hundreds of thousands of views.\n\n48:33.500 --> 48:34.980\n Even though it was in a minor journal\n\n48:34.980 --> 48:37.020\n because, you know, somebody pitched it the right way\n\n48:37.020 --> 48:39.380\n that it suddenly caught everybody's attention.\n\n48:39.380 --> 48:42.020\n Whereas other papers that are sort of truly fundamental,\n\n48:42.020 --> 48:43.660\n you know, we have a hard time\n\n48:43.660 --> 48:46.060\n getting the editors even excited about them\n\n48:46.060 --> 48:47.860\n when so many hundreds of people\n\n48:47.860 --> 48:50.860\n are already using the results and building upon them.\n\n48:50.860 --> 48:54.420\n So I do appreciate that there's a discrepancy\n\n48:54.420 --> 48:57.420\n between the perception and the perceived success\n\n48:57.420 --> 48:59.500\n and the awards that you get for various papers.\n\n48:59.500 --> 49:02.500\n But I think that fundamentally, I know that, you know,\n\n49:02.500 --> 49:04.380\n some paper, I'm so, so when you write.\n\n49:04.380 --> 49:06.820\n So is there a paper that you're most proud of?\n\n49:06.820 --> 49:09.340\n See, now you just, you trapped yourself.\n\n49:09.340 --> 49:10.340\n No, no, no, no, I mean.\n\n49:10.340 --> 49:13.540\n Is there a line of work that you have a sense\n\n49:14.620 --> 49:17.580\n is really powerful that you've done to date?\n\n49:17.580 --> 49:20.180\n You've done so much work in so many directions,\n\n49:20.180 --> 49:21.860\n which is interesting.\n\n49:21.860 --> 49:25.340\n Is there something where you think is quite special?\n\n49:25.340 --> 49:28.740\n I mean, it's like asking me to say\n\n49:28.740 --> 49:30.380\n which of my three children I love best.\n\n49:30.380 --> 49:31.220\n I mean.\n\n49:34.060 --> 49:34.900\n Exactly.\n\n49:34.900 --> 49:38.500\n So, I mean, and it's such a gimme question\n\n49:38.500 --> 49:42.580\n that is so, so difficult not to brag\n\n49:42.580 --> 49:44.740\n about the awesome work that my team\n\n49:44.740 --> 49:46.060\n and my students have done.\n\n49:47.060 --> 49:49.940\n And I'll just mention a few off the top of my head.\n\n49:49.940 --> 49:53.060\n I mean, basically there's a few landmark papers\n\n49:53.060 --> 49:56.780\n that I think have shaped my scientific path.\n\n49:56.780 --> 50:00.380\n And, you know, I like to somehow describe it\n\n50:00.380 --> 50:03.620\n as a linear continuation of one thing led to another\n\n50:03.620 --> 50:05.340\n and led to another led to another.\n\n50:05.340 --> 50:09.060\n And, you know, it kind of all started with,\n\n50:11.020 --> 50:12.340\n skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.\n\n50:12.340 --> 50:14.020\n Let me try to start somewhere in the middle.\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:19.020\n So my first PhD paper was the first comparative analysis\n\n50:20.460 --> 50:21.820\n of multiple species.\n\n50:21.820 --> 50:23.580\n So multiple complete genomes.\n\n50:23.580 --> 50:27.340\n So for the first time we basically developed the concept\n\n50:27.340 --> 50:29.980\n of genome wide evolutionary signatures.\n\n50:29.980 --> 50:32.940\n The fact that you could look across the entire genome\n\n50:32.940 --> 50:35.660\n and understand how things evolve.\n\n50:35.660 --> 50:38.260\n And from these signatures of evolution\n\n50:38.260 --> 50:41.540\n you could go back and study any one region\n\n50:41.540 --> 50:44.020\n and say, that's a protein coding gene.\n\n50:44.020 --> 50:45.540\n That's an RNA gene.\n\n50:45.540 --> 50:47.260\n That's a regulatory motif.\n\n50:47.260 --> 50:50.100\n That's a, you know, binding site and so on and so forth.\n\n50:50.100 --> 50:50.940\n So.\n\n50:50.940 --> 50:52.660\n I'm sorry, so comparing different.\n\n50:52.660 --> 50:53.780\n Different species.\n\n50:53.780 --> 50:55.060\n Species of the same.\n\n50:55.060 --> 50:57.140\n So take human, mouse, rat and dog.\n\n50:57.140 --> 50:58.060\n Yeah.\n\n50:58.060 --> 50:59.980\n You know, they're all animals, they're all mammals.\n\n50:59.980 --> 51:02.820\n They're all performing similar functions with their heart,\n\n51:02.820 --> 51:05.860\n with their brain, with their lungs, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n51:05.860 --> 51:08.140\n So there's many functional elements\n\n51:08.140 --> 51:10.900\n that make us uniquely mammalian.\n\n51:10.900 --> 51:14.620\n And those mammalian elements are actually conserved.\n\n51:14.620 --> 51:17.740\n 99% of our genome does not code for protein.\n\n51:18.940 --> 51:20.780\n 1% codes for protein.\n\n51:20.780 --> 51:25.100\n The other 99%, we frankly didn't know what it does\n\n51:25.100 --> 51:28.140\n until we started doing this comparative genomic studies.\n\n51:28.140 --> 51:32.060\n So basically these series of papers in my career\n\n51:32.060 --> 51:34.540\n have basically first developed that concept\n\n51:34.540 --> 51:37.460\n of evolutionary signatures and then apply them to yeast,\n\n51:37.460 --> 51:40.140\n apply them to flies, apply them to four mammals,\n\n51:40.140 --> 51:41.620\n apply them to 17 fungi,\n\n51:41.620 --> 51:43.700\n apply them to 12 Drosophila species,\n\n51:43.700 --> 51:46.900\n apply them to then 29 mammals and now 200 mammals.\n\n51:46.900 --> 51:48.820\n So sorry, so can we.\n\n51:48.820 --> 51:51.380\n So the evolutionary signatures seems like\n\n51:51.380 --> 51:53.580\n it's such a fascinating idea.\n\n51:53.580 --> 51:57.380\n And we're probably gonna linger on your early PhD work\n\n51:57.380 --> 51:58.220\n for two hours.\n\n51:58.220 --> 52:03.220\n But what is, how can you reveal something interesting\n\n52:04.260 --> 52:08.500\n about the genome by looking at the multiple,\n\n52:08.500 --> 52:11.900\n multiple species and looking at the evolutionary signatures?\n\n52:11.900 --> 52:16.900\n Yeah, so you basically align\n\n52:16.900 --> 52:20.820\n the matching regions.\n\n52:20.820 --> 52:23.980\n So everything evolved from a common ancestor way, way back.\n\n52:23.980 --> 52:26.020\n And mammals evolved from a common ancestor\n\n52:26.020 --> 52:27.860\n about 60 million years back.\n\n52:27.860 --> 52:32.860\n So after the meteor that killed off the dinosaurs landed\n\n52:35.460 --> 52:38.780\n near Machu Picchu, we know the crater.\n\n52:38.780 --> 52:40.580\n It didn't allegedly land.\n\n52:41.700 --> 52:42.860\n That was the aliens, okay.\n\n52:42.860 --> 52:44.660\n No, just slightly north of Machu Picchu\n\n52:44.660 --> 52:47.100\n in the Gulf of Mexico, there's a giant hole\n\n52:47.100 --> 52:49.060\n that that meteor impact.\n\n52:49.060 --> 52:51.380\n Sorry, is that definitive to people?\n\n52:51.380 --> 52:56.380\n Have people conclusively figured out\n\n52:56.380 --> 52:58.180\n what killed the dinosaurs?\n\n52:58.180 --> 52:59.220\n I think so.\n\n52:59.220 --> 53:00.540\n So it was a meteor?\n\n53:00.540 --> 53:04.860\n Well, volcanic activity, all kinds of other stuff\n\n53:04.860 --> 53:09.580\n is coinciding, but the meteor is pretty unique\n\n53:09.580 --> 53:11.180\n and we now have. That's also terrifying.\n\n53:11.180 --> 53:14.940\n I wouldn't, we still have a lot of 2020 left,\n\n53:14.940 --> 53:15.780\n so if anything.\n\n53:15.780 --> 53:17.220\n No, no, but think about it this way.\n\n53:17.220 --> 53:22.220\n So the dinosaurs ruled the earth for 175 million years.\n\n53:24.420 --> 53:28.380\n We humans have been around for what?\n\n53:28.380 --> 53:29.940\n Less than 1 million years.\n\n53:29.940 --> 53:32.900\n If you're super generous about what you call humans\n\n53:32.900 --> 53:35.340\n and you include chimps basically.\n\n53:35.340 --> 53:38.580\n So we are just getting warmed up\n\n53:38.580 --> 53:42.500\n and we've ruled the planet much more ruthlessly\n\n53:42.500 --> 53:43.860\n than Tyrannosaurus Rex.\n\n53:46.220 --> 53:48.340\n T Rex had much less of an environmental impact\n\n53:48.340 --> 53:49.580\n than we did.\n\n53:49.580 --> 53:54.020\n And if you give us another 174 million years,\n\n53:54.020 --> 53:58.380\n humans will look very different if we make it that far.\n\n53:58.380 --> 54:02.180\n So I think dinosaurs basically are much more\n\n54:02.180 --> 54:06.100\n of life history on earth than we are in all respects.\n\n54:06.100 --> 54:08.740\n But look at the bright side, when they were killed off,\n\n54:08.740 --> 54:10.860\n another life form emerged, mammals.\n\n54:10.860 --> 54:14.620\n And that's that whole evolutionary branching\n\n54:14.620 --> 54:15.460\n that's happened.\n\n54:15.460 --> 54:17.060\n So you kind of have,\n\n54:17.060 --> 54:19.180\n when you have these evolutionary signatures,\n\n54:19.180 --> 54:22.660\n is there basically a map of how the genome changed?\n\n54:22.660 --> 54:23.540\n Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n54:23.540 --> 54:26.180\n So now you can go back to this early mammal\n\n54:26.180 --> 54:29.260\n that was hiding in caves and you can basically ask\n\n54:29.260 --> 54:31.300\n what happened after the dinosaurs were wiped out.\n\n54:31.300 --> 54:34.060\n A ton of evolutionary niches opened up\n\n54:34.060 --> 54:37.460\n and the mammals started populating all of these niches.\n\n54:37.460 --> 54:40.660\n And in that diversification,\n\n54:40.660 --> 54:44.740\n there was room for expansion of new types of functions.\n\n54:44.740 --> 54:49.740\n So some of them populated the air with bats flying,\n\n54:50.140 --> 54:51.660\n a new evolution of flight.\n\n54:53.260 --> 54:57.460\n Some populated the oceans with dolphins and whales\n\n54:57.460 --> 54:58.700\n going off to swim, et cetera.\n\n54:58.700 --> 55:01.380\n But we all are fundamentally mammals.\n\n55:01.380 --> 55:04.220\n So you can take the genomes of all these species\n\n55:04.220 --> 55:06.260\n and align them on top of each other\n\n55:06.260 --> 55:11.260\n and basically create nucleotide resolution correspondences.\n\n55:11.860 --> 55:14.220\n What my PhD work showed is that when you do that,\n\n55:14.220 --> 55:17.180\n when you line up species on top of each other,\n\n55:17.180 --> 55:19.860\n you can see that within protein coding genes,\n\n55:19.860 --> 55:21.980\n there's a particular pattern of evolution\n\n55:21.980 --> 55:25.780\n that is dictated by the level at which\n\n55:25.780 --> 55:27.700\n evolutionary selection acts.\n\n55:27.700 --> 55:30.700\n If I'm coding for a protein and I change\n\n55:30.700 --> 55:34.340\n the third codon position of a triplet\n\n55:34.340 --> 55:36.580\n that codes for that amino acid,\n\n55:36.580 --> 55:38.980\n the same amino acid will be encoded.\n\n55:38.980 --> 55:42.020\n So that basically means that any kind of mutation\n\n55:42.020 --> 55:46.140\n that preserves that translation that is invariant\n\n55:46.140 --> 55:49.580\n to that ultimate functional assessment\n\n55:49.580 --> 55:52.420\n that evolution will give is tolerated.\n\n55:52.420 --> 55:55.100\n So for any function that you're trying to achieve,\n\n55:55.100 --> 55:57.820\n there's a set of sequences that encode it.\n\n55:57.820 --> 56:00.380\n You can now look at the mapping,\n\n56:00.380 --> 56:04.460\n the graph isomorphism, if you wish,\n\n56:04.460 --> 56:07.460\n between all of the possible DNA encodings\n\n56:07.460 --> 56:09.780\n of a particular function and that function.\n\n56:09.780 --> 56:12.420\n And instead of having just that exact sequence\n\n56:12.420 --> 56:15.020\n at the protein level, you can think of the set\n\n56:15.020 --> 56:18.020\n of protein sequences that all fulfill the same function.\n\n56:18.020 --> 56:19.420\n What's evolution doing?\n\n56:19.420 --> 56:20.820\n Evolution has two components.\n\n56:20.820 --> 56:25.300\n One component is random, blind, and stupid mutation.\n\n56:25.300 --> 56:30.300\n The other component is super smart, ruthless selection.\n\n56:32.020 --> 56:33.500\n That's my mom calling from Greece.\n\n56:35.220 --> 56:40.060\n Yes, I might be a fully grown man, but I am a Greek.\n\n56:40.060 --> 56:41.540\n Did you just cancel the call?\n\n56:41.540 --> 56:42.380\n Wow, you're in trouble.\n\n56:42.380 --> 56:43.220\n I know, I'm in trouble.\n\n56:43.220 --> 56:44.860\n No, she's gonna be calling the cops.\n\n56:44.860 --> 56:45.700\n Honey, are you okay?\n\n56:45.700 --> 56:47.700\n I'm gonna edit this clip out and send it to her.\n\n56:47.700 --> 56:48.540\n Sure.\n\n56:51.660 --> 56:53.060\n So there's a lot of encoding\n\n56:53.060 --> 56:54.300\n for the same kind of function.\n\n56:54.300 --> 56:56.620\n Yeah, so you now have this mapping\n\n56:56.620 --> 56:58.740\n between all of the set of functions\n\n56:58.740 --> 57:00.900\n that could all encode the same,\n\n57:00.900 --> 57:02.180\n all of the set of sequences\n\n57:02.180 --> 57:04.260\n that can all encode the same function.\n\n57:04.260 --> 57:06.580\n What evolutionary signatures does\n\n57:06.580 --> 57:08.980\n is that it basically looks at the shape\n\n57:08.980 --> 57:11.180\n of that distribution of sequences\n\n57:11.180 --> 57:13.060\n that all encode the same thing.\n\n57:13.060 --> 57:15.220\n And based on that shape, you can basically say,\n\n57:15.220 --> 57:17.940\n ooh, proteins have a very different shape\n\n57:17.940 --> 57:21.340\n than RNA structures, than regulatory motifs, et cetera.\n\n57:21.340 --> 57:24.500\n So just by scanning a sequence, ignoring the sequence\n\n57:24.500 --> 57:26.740\n and just looking at the patterns of change,\n\n57:26.740 --> 57:29.380\n I'm like, wow, this thing is evolving like a protein\n\n57:29.380 --> 57:31.700\n and that thing is evolving like a motif\n\n57:31.700 --> 57:33.180\n and that thing is evolving.\n\n57:33.180 --> 57:35.620\n So that's exactly what we just did for COVID.\n\n57:35.620 --> 57:39.020\n So our paper that we posted in bioRxiv about coronavirus\n\n57:39.020 --> 57:42.020\n basically took this concept of evolutionary signatures\n\n57:42.020 --> 57:45.740\n and applied it on the SARS CoV2 genome\n\n57:45.740 --> 57:48.540\n that is responsible for the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\n57:48.540 --> 57:50.540\n And comparing it to?\n\n57:50.540 --> 57:52.460\n To 44 serbicovirus species.\n\n57:52.460 --> 57:53.700\n So this is the beta.\n\n57:53.700 --> 57:56.220\n What word did you just use, serbicovirus?\n\n57:56.220 --> 58:00.460\n Serbicovirus, so SARS related beta coronavirus.\n\n58:00.460 --> 58:01.460\n It's a portmanteau of a bunch.\n\n58:01.460 --> 58:03.060\n So that whole family of viruses.\n\n58:03.060 --> 58:03.900\n Yeah, so.\n\n58:03.900 --> 58:05.100\n How big is that family by the way?\n\n58:05.100 --> 58:07.420\n We have 44 species that, or I mean.\n\n58:07.420 --> 58:09.340\n There's 44 species in the family?\n\n58:09.340 --> 58:11.100\n Yeah. Virus is a clever bunch.\n\n58:11.100 --> 58:12.900\n No, no, but there's just 44.\n\n58:12.900 --> 58:15.660\n And again, we don't call them species in viruses.\n\n58:15.660 --> 58:16.500\n We call them strains.\n\n58:16.500 --> 58:18.260\n But anyway, there's 44 strains.\n\n58:18.260 --> 58:22.300\n And that's a tiny little subset of maybe another 50 strains\n\n58:22.300 --> 58:24.460\n that are just far too distantly related.\n\n58:24.460 --> 58:29.060\n Most of those only infect bats as the host\n\n58:29.060 --> 58:34.020\n and a subset of only four or five have ever infected humans.\n\n58:34.020 --> 58:35.660\n And we basically took all of those\n\n58:35.660 --> 58:37.740\n and we aligned them in the same exact way\n\n58:37.740 --> 58:39.020\n that we've aligned mammals.\n\n58:39.020 --> 58:42.340\n And then we looked at what proteins are,\n\n58:42.340 --> 58:44.980\n which of the currently hypothesized genes\n\n58:44.980 --> 58:47.420\n for the coronavirus genome\n\n58:47.420 --> 58:50.260\n are in fact evolving like proteins and which ones are not.\n\n58:50.260 --> 58:52.940\n And what we found is that ORF10,\n\n58:52.940 --> 58:54.620\n the last little open reading frame,\n\n58:54.620 --> 58:56.980\n the last little gene in the genome is bogus.\n\n58:56.980 --> 58:58.700\n That's not a protein at all.\n\n58:58.700 --> 58:59.900\n What is it?\n\n58:59.900 --> 59:01.820\n It's an RNA structure.\n\n59:01.820 --> 59:03.540\n That doesn't have a.\n\n59:03.540 --> 59:05.700\n It doesn't get translated into amino acids.\n\n59:05.700 --> 59:08.260\n And that, so it's important to narrow down\n\n59:08.260 --> 59:10.780\n to basically discover what's useful and what's not.\n\n59:10.780 --> 59:11.620\n Exactly.\n\n59:11.620 --> 59:13.580\n Basically, what is even the set of genes?\n\n59:13.580 --> 59:15.500\n The other thing that these evolutionary signatures showed\n\n59:15.500 --> 59:20.500\n is that within ORF3A lies a tiny little additional gene\n\n59:20.660 --> 59:22.700\n encoded within the other gene.\n\n59:22.700 --> 59:24.540\n So you can translate a DNA sequence\n\n59:24.540 --> 59:26.820\n in three different reading frames.\n\n59:26.820 --> 59:30.100\n If you start in the first one, it's ATG, et cetera.\n\n59:30.100 --> 59:32.940\n If you start on the second one, it's TGC, et cetera.\n\n59:32.940 --> 59:36.620\n And there's a gene within a gene.\n\n59:36.620 --> 59:37.860\n So there's a whole other protein\n\n59:37.860 --> 59:41.180\n that we didn't know about that might be super important.\n\n59:41.180 --> 59:45.620\n So we don't even know the building blocks of SARS COVID 2.\n\n59:45.620 --> 59:48.300\n So if we want to understand coronavirus biology\n\n59:48.300 --> 59:50.500\n and eventually find it successfully,\n\n59:50.500 --> 59:51.940\n we need to even have the set of genes\n\n59:51.940 --> 59:53.660\n and these evolutionary signatures\n\n59:53.660 --> 59:55.540\n that I developed in my PhD work.\n\n59:55.540 --> 59:56.380\n Are you really useful here?\n\n59:56.380 --> 59:57.420\n We just recently used.\n\n59:57.420 --> 59:59.500\n You know what, let's run with that tangent\n\n59:59.500 --> 1:00:01.100\n for a little bit, if it's okay.\n\n1:00:01.100 --> 1:00:06.100\n Can we talk about the COVID 19 a little bit more?\n\n1:00:08.700 --> 1:00:13.180\n What's your sense about the genome, the proteins,\n\n1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:16.340\n the functions that we understand about COVID 19?\n\n1:00:16.340 --> 1:00:18.900\n Where do we stand in your sense?\n\n1:00:18.900 --> 1:00:21.420\n What are the big open problems?\n\n1:00:21.420 --> 1:00:25.380\n And also, you kind of said it's important to understand\n\n1:00:25.380 --> 1:00:29.860\n what are the important proteins\n\n1:00:29.860 --> 1:00:32.100\n and why is that important?\n\n1:00:34.140 --> 1:00:39.140\n So what else does the comparison of these species tell us?\n\n1:00:39.420 --> 1:00:43.020\n What it tells us is how fast are things evolving?\n\n1:00:43.020 --> 1:00:46.620\n It tells us about at what level is the acceleration\n\n1:00:46.620 --> 1:00:50.820\n or deceleration pedal set for every one of these proteins.\n\n1:00:50.820 --> 1:00:53.180\n So the genome has 30 some genes.\n\n1:00:54.100 --> 1:00:56.580\n Some genes evolve super, super fast.\n\n1:00:56.580 --> 1:00:59.020\n Others evolve super, super slow.\n\n1:00:59.020 --> 1:01:00.460\n If you look at the polymerase gene\n\n1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:01.980\n that basically replicates the genome,\n\n1:01:01.980 --> 1:01:04.220\n that's a super slow evolving one.\n\n1:01:04.220 --> 1:01:06.340\n If you look at the nucleocapsid protein,\n\n1:01:06.340 --> 1:01:08.380\n that's also super slow evolving.\n\n1:01:09.420 --> 1:01:11.460\n If you look at the spike one protein,\n\n1:01:11.460 --> 1:01:13.380\n this is the part of the spike protein\n\n1:01:13.380 --> 1:01:15.740\n that actually touches the ACE2 receptor\n\n1:01:15.740 --> 1:01:20.740\n and then enables the virus to attach to your cells.\n\n1:01:21.300 --> 1:01:23.820\n That's the thing that gives it that visual...\n\n1:01:23.820 --> 1:01:24.860\n Yeah, the corona look basically.\n\n1:01:24.860 --> 1:01:26.020\n The corona look, yeah.\n\n1:01:26.020 --> 1:01:28.540\n So basically the spike protein sticks out of the virus\n\n1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:31.180\n and there's a first part of the protein S1\n\n1:01:31.180 --> 1:01:34.540\n which basically attaches to the ACE2 receptor.\n\n1:01:34.540 --> 1:01:39.500\n And then S2 is the latch that sort of pushes and channels\n\n1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:41.060\n the fusion of the membranes\n\n1:01:41.060 --> 1:01:46.060\n and then the incorporation of the viral RNA inside our cells\n\n1:01:47.060 --> 1:01:50.460\n which then gets translated into all of these 30 proteins.\n\n1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:55.460\n So the S1 protein is evolving ridiculously fast.\n\n1:01:55.460 --> 1:01:59.460\n So if you look at the stop versus gas pedal,\n\n1:01:59.460 --> 1:02:01.140\n the gas pedal is all the way down.\n\n1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:05.140\n ORF8 is also evolving super fast\n\n1:02:05.140 --> 1:02:06.700\n and ORF6 is evolving super fast.\n\n1:02:06.700 --> 1:02:08.020\n We have no idea what they do.\n\n1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:11.340\n We have some idea but nowhere near what S1 is.\n\n1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:12.180\n So what the...\n\n1:02:12.180 --> 1:02:14.220\n Isn't that terrifying that S1 is evolving?\n\n1:02:14.220 --> 1:02:16.900\n That means that's a really useful function\n\n1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:18.780\n and if it's evolving fast,\n\n1:02:18.780 --> 1:02:20.700\n doesn't that mean new strains could be created\n\n1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:21.540\n or it does something?\n\n1:02:21.540 --> 1:02:24.220\n That means that it's searching for how to match,\n\n1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:26.700\n how to best match the host.\n\n1:02:26.700 --> 1:02:29.260\n So basically anything in general in evolution,\n\n1:02:29.260 --> 1:02:30.100\n if you look at genomes,\n\n1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:32.300\n anything that's contacting the environment\n\n1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:34.980\n is evolving much faster than anything that's internal.\n\n1:02:34.980 --> 1:02:37.140\n And the reason is that the environment changes.\n\n1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:42.140\n So if you look at the evolution of the cervical viruses,\n\n1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:44.420\n the S1 protein has evolved very rapidly\n\n1:02:44.420 --> 1:02:47.420\n because it's attaching to different hosts each time.\n\n1:02:47.420 --> 1:02:48.500\n We think of them as bats,\n\n1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:50.540\n but there's thousands of species of bats\n\n1:02:50.540 --> 1:02:52.900\n and to go from one species of bat to another species of bat,\n\n1:02:52.900 --> 1:02:55.940\n you have to adjust S1 to the new ACE2 receptor\n\n1:02:55.940 --> 1:02:58.100\n that you're gonna be facing in that new species.\n\n1:02:58.100 --> 1:02:59.740\n Sorry, quick tangent.\n\n1:02:59.740 --> 1:03:03.540\n Is it fascinating to you that viruses are doing this?\n\n1:03:03.540 --> 1:03:06.900\n I mean, it feels like they're this intelligent organism.\n\n1:03:06.900 --> 1:03:11.900\n I mean, does it give you pause how incredible it is\n\n1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:16.500\n that the evolutionary dynamics that you're describing\n\n1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:19.260\n is actually happening and they're freaking out,\n\n1:03:19.260 --> 1:03:22.180\n figuring out how to jump from bats to humans\n\n1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:24.220\n all in this distributed fashion?\n\n1:03:24.220 --> 1:03:25.620\n And then most of us don't even say\n\n1:03:25.620 --> 1:03:27.660\n they're alive or intelligent or whatever.\n\n1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:31.340\n So intelligence is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n1:03:31.340 --> 1:03:34.940\n Stupid is as stupid does, as Forrest Gump would say,\n\n1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:36.580\n and intelligent is as intelligent does.\n\n1:03:36.580 --> 1:03:39.220\n So basically if the virus is finding solutions\n\n1:03:39.220 --> 1:03:40.900\n that we think of as intelligent,\n\n1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:42.260\n yeah, it's probably intelligent,\n\n1:03:42.260 --> 1:03:43.940\n but that's again in the eye of the beholder.\n\n1:03:43.940 --> 1:03:45.700\n Do you think viruses are intelligent?\n\n1:03:45.700 --> 1:03:47.300\n Oh, of course not.\n\n1:03:47.300 --> 1:03:48.140\n Really?\n\n1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.060\n No.\n\n1:03:49.060 --> 1:03:50.180\n It's so incredible.\n\n1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:52.740\n So remember when I was talking about the two components\n\n1:03:52.740 --> 1:03:55.900\n of evolution, one is the stupid mutation,\n\n1:03:55.900 --> 1:03:57.100\n which is completely blind,\n\n1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:00.260\n and the other one is the super smart selection,\n\n1:04:00.260 --> 1:04:01.820\n which is ruthless.\n\n1:04:01.820 --> 1:04:04.780\n So it's not viruses who are smart.\n\n1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:06.860\n It's this component of evolution that's smart.\n\n1:04:06.860 --> 1:04:10.380\n So it's evolution that sort of appears smart.\n\n1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:12.020\n And how is that happening?\n\n1:04:12.020 --> 1:04:17.020\n By huge parallel search across thousands of parallel\n\n1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:21.700\n of parallel infections throughout the world right now.\n\n1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:23.980\n Yes, but so to push back on that,\n\n1:04:23.980 --> 1:04:27.980\n so yes, so then the intelligence is in the mechanism,\n\n1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:31.380\n but then by that argument,\n\n1:04:31.380 --> 1:04:32.860\n viruses would be more intelligent\n\n1:04:32.860 --> 1:04:34.700\n because there's just more of them.\n\n1:04:34.700 --> 1:04:38.740\n So the search, they're basically the brute force search\n\n1:04:38.740 --> 1:04:40.340\n that's happening with viruses\n\n1:04:40.340 --> 1:04:43.220\n because there's so many more of them than humans,\n\n1:04:43.220 --> 1:04:47.540\n then they're taken as a whole are more intelligent.\n\n1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:51.260\n I mean, so you don't think it's possible that,\n\n1:04:51.260 --> 1:04:55.580\n I mean, who runs, would we even be here if viruses weren't,\n\n1:04:55.580 --> 1:04:58.380\n I mean, who runs this thing?\n\n1:04:58.380 --> 1:04:59.700\n So humans or viruses?\n\n1:04:59.700 --> 1:05:03.060\n So let me answer, yeah, let me answer your question.\n\n1:05:03.060 --> 1:05:08.060\n So we would not be here if it wasn't for viruses.\n\n1:05:10.460 --> 1:05:11.820\n And part of the reason is that\n\n1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:14.340\n if you look at mammalian evolution early on\n\n1:05:14.340 --> 1:05:16.100\n in this mammalian radiation\n\n1:05:16.100 --> 1:05:18.580\n that basically happened after the death of the dinosaurs\n\n1:05:18.580 --> 1:05:22.740\n is that some of the viruses that we had in our genome\n\n1:05:22.740 --> 1:05:24.580\n spread throughout our genome\n\n1:05:24.580 --> 1:05:27.260\n and created binding sites\n\n1:05:27.260 --> 1:05:30.340\n for new classes of regulatory proteins.\n\n1:05:30.340 --> 1:05:33.340\n And these binding sites that landed all over our genome\n\n1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:36.860\n are now control elements that basically control our genes\n\n1:05:36.860 --> 1:05:40.420\n and sort of help the complexity of the circuitry\n\n1:05:40.420 --> 1:05:42.220\n of mammalian genomes.\n\n1:05:42.220 --> 1:05:45.100\n So, you know, everything's coevolution.\n\n1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:47.780\n That's fascinating, we're working together.\n\n1:05:47.780 --> 1:05:48.620\n And yet you say they're dumb.\n\n1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:49.620\n We've coopted them.\n\n1:05:49.620 --> 1:05:51.660\n No, I never said they're dumb.\n\n1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:53.620\n They just don't care.\n\n1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:54.980\n They don't care.\n\n1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:56.980\n Another thing, oh, is the virus trying to kill us?\n\n1:05:56.980 --> 1:05:58.020\n No, it's not.\n\n1:05:58.020 --> 1:05:59.980\n The virus is not trying to kill you.\n\n1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:02.820\n It's actually actively trying to not kill you.\n\n1:06:02.820 --> 1:06:04.940\n So when you get infected, if you die,\n\n1:06:05.980 --> 1:06:07.340\n bomber, I killed him,\n\n1:06:07.340 --> 1:06:09.140\n is what the reaction of the virus will be.\n\n1:06:09.140 --> 1:06:10.940\n Why? Because that virus won't spread.\n\n1:06:12.060 --> 1:06:13.780\n Many people have a misconception of,\n\n1:06:13.780 --> 1:06:16.780\n oh, viruses are smart or oh, viruses are mean.\n\n1:06:16.780 --> 1:06:17.620\n They don't care.\n\n1:06:18.620 --> 1:06:20.780\n It's like, you have to clean yourself\n\n1:06:20.780 --> 1:06:23.300\n of any kind of anthropomorphism out there.\n\n1:06:23.300 --> 1:06:24.140\n I don't know.\n\n1:06:24.140 --> 1:06:24.980\n Oh, yes.\n\n1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:29.580\n So there's a sense when taken as a whole that there's...\n\n1:06:31.780 --> 1:06:32.980\n It's in the eye of the beholder.\n\n1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:34.180\n Stupid is as stupid does.\n\n1:06:34.180 --> 1:06:35.940\n Intelligent is as intelligent does.\n\n1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:38.460\n So if you want to call them intelligent, that's fine.\n\n1:06:38.460 --> 1:06:40.420\n Because the end result is that\n\n1:06:40.420 --> 1:06:42.700\n they're finding amazing solutions.\n\n1:06:42.700 --> 1:06:44.300\n I mean, I am in awe.\n\n1:06:44.300 --> 1:06:45.580\n They're so dumb about it.\n\n1:06:45.580 --> 1:06:46.420\n They're just doing dumb.\n\n1:06:46.420 --> 1:06:47.260\n They don't care.\n\n1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:48.580\n They're not dumb and they're just don't care.\n\n1:06:48.580 --> 1:06:50.060\n They don't care.\n\n1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:51.780\n The care word is really interesting.\n\n1:06:51.780 --> 1:06:54.380\n I mean, there could be an argument that they're conscious.\n\n1:06:54.380 --> 1:06:55.460\n They're just dividing.\n\n1:06:55.460 --> 1:06:56.300\n They're not.\n\n1:06:56.300 --> 1:06:57.620\n They're just dividing.\n\n1:06:57.620 --> 1:06:59.180\n They're just a little entity\n\n1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:02.660\n which happens to be dividing and spreading.\n\n1:07:02.660 --> 1:07:04.420\n It just doesn't want to kill us.\n\n1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:06.340\n In fact, it prefers not to kill us.\n\n1:07:06.340 --> 1:07:07.580\n It just wants to spread.\n\n1:07:07.580 --> 1:07:11.020\n And when I say wants, again, I'm anthropomorphizing,\n\n1:07:11.020 --> 1:07:15.060\n but it's just that if you have two versions of a virus,\n\n1:07:15.060 --> 1:07:17.420\n one acquires a mutation that spreads more,\n\n1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:18.620\n that's going to spread more.\n\n1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:20.260\n One acquires a mutation that spreads less,\n\n1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:21.740\n that's going to be lost.\n\n1:07:21.740 --> 1:07:24.020\n One acquires a mutation that enters faster,\n\n1:07:24.020 --> 1:07:25.100\n that's going to be kept.\n\n1:07:25.100 --> 1:07:27.020\n One acquires a mutation that kills you right away,\n\n1:07:27.020 --> 1:07:28.420\n it's going to be lost.\n\n1:07:28.420 --> 1:07:30.500\n So over evolutionary time,\n\n1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:32.700\n the viruses that spread super well\n\n1:07:32.700 --> 1:07:33.940\n but don't kill the host\n\n1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:36.260\n are the ones that are going to survive.\n\n1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:39.060\n Yeah, but so you brilliantly described\n\n1:07:39.060 --> 1:07:41.060\n the basic mechanisms of how it all happens,\n\n1:07:41.060 --> 1:07:46.060\n but when you zoom out and you see the entirety of viruses,\n\n1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:49.980\n maybe across different strains of viruses,\n\n1:07:49.980 --> 1:07:52.380\n it seems like a living organism.\n\n1:07:52.380 --> 1:07:55.020\n I am in awe of biology.\n\n1:07:55.020 --> 1:07:58.340\n I find biology amazingly beautiful.\n\n1:07:58.340 --> 1:08:01.100\n I find the design of the current coronavirus,\n\n1:08:01.100 --> 1:08:04.260\n however lethal it is, amazingly beautiful.\n\n1:08:04.260 --> 1:08:06.340\n The way that it is encoded,\n\n1:08:06.340 --> 1:08:08.980\n the way that it tricks your cells\n\n1:08:08.980 --> 1:08:12.340\n into making 30 proteins from a single RNA.\n\n1:08:12.340 --> 1:08:14.340\n Human cells don't do that.\n\n1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:18.180\n Human cells make one protein from each RNA molecule.\n\n1:08:18.180 --> 1:08:20.220\n They don't make two, they make one.\n\n1:08:20.220 --> 1:08:22.340\n We are hardwired to make only one protein\n\n1:08:22.340 --> 1:08:23.780\n from every RNA molecule.\n\n1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:25.700\n And yet this virus goes in,\n\n1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:27.620\n throws in a single messenger RNA.\n\n1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:29.980\n Just like any messenger RNA,\n\n1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:32.140\n we have tens of thousands of messenger RNAs\n\n1:08:32.140 --> 1:08:34.140\n in our cells in any one time.\n\n1:08:34.140 --> 1:08:35.820\n In every one of our cells.\n\n1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:40.620\n It throws in one RNA and that RNA is so,\n\n1:08:40.620 --> 1:08:44.100\n I'm gonna use your word here, not my word, intelligent.\n\n1:08:44.100 --> 1:08:49.100\n That it hijacks the entire machinery of your human cell.\n\n1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:52.500\n It basically has at the beginning,\n\n1:08:52.500 --> 1:08:54.460\n a giant open reading frame.\n\n1:08:54.460 --> 1:08:57.140\n That's a giant protein that gets translated.\n\n1:08:57.140 --> 1:09:01.540\n Two thirds of that RNA make a single giant protein.\n\n1:09:01.540 --> 1:09:03.340\n That single protein is basically\n\n1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:04.540\n what a human cell would make.\n\n1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:06.340\n It's like, oh, here's a start code.\n\n1:09:06.340 --> 1:09:07.700\n I'm gonna start translating here.\n\n1:09:07.700 --> 1:09:08.620\n Human cells are kind of dumb.\n\n1:09:08.620 --> 1:09:09.460\n I'm sorry.\n\n1:09:09.460 --> 1:09:12.420\n Again, this is not the words I would normally use.\n\n1:09:12.420 --> 1:09:13.420\n But the human cell basically says,\n\n1:09:13.420 --> 1:09:15.020\n oh, this is an RNA, must be mine.\n\n1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:15.860\n Let me translate.\n\n1:09:15.860 --> 1:09:17.020\n And it starts translating it.\n\n1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:18.460\n And then you're in trouble.\n\n1:09:18.460 --> 1:09:19.300\n Why?\n\n1:09:19.300 --> 1:09:22.380\n Because that one protein as it's growing,\n\n1:09:22.380 --> 1:09:26.980\n gets cleaved into about 20 different peptides.\n\n1:09:26.980 --> 1:09:30.940\n The first peptide and the second peptide start interacting\n\n1:09:30.940 --> 1:09:32.460\n and the third one and the fourth one.\n\n1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:37.460\n And they shut off the ribosome of the whole cell\n\n1:09:37.820 --> 1:09:42.820\n to not translate human RNAs anymore.\n\n1:09:42.820 --> 1:09:46.580\n So the virus basically hijacks your cells\n\n1:09:46.580 --> 1:09:50.820\n and it cuts, it cleaves every one of your human RNAs\n\n1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:52.100\n to basically say to the ribosome,\n\n1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:53.500\n don't translate this one, junk.\n\n1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:55.140\n Don't look at this one, junk.\n\n1:09:55.140 --> 1:09:58.740\n And it only spares its own RNAs\n\n1:09:58.740 --> 1:10:01.300\n because they have a particular mark that it spares.\n\n1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:04.380\n Then all of the ribosomes that normally make protein\n\n1:10:04.380 --> 1:10:06.860\n in your human cells are now only able\n\n1:10:06.860 --> 1:10:09.220\n to translate viral RNAs.\n\n1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:11.460\n And then more and more and more and more of them.\n\n1:10:11.460 --> 1:10:13.100\n That's the first 20 proteins.\n\n1:10:13.100 --> 1:10:16.300\n In fact, halfway down about protein 11,\n\n1:10:16.300 --> 1:10:17.940\n between 11 and 12,\n\n1:10:17.940 --> 1:10:21.020\n you basically have a translational slippage\n\n1:10:21.020 --> 1:10:23.420\n where the ribosome skips reading frame.\n\n1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:24.980\n And it translates from one reading frame\n\n1:10:24.980 --> 1:10:25.820\n to another reading frame.\n\n1:10:25.820 --> 1:10:27.100\n That means that about half of them\n\n1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:29.260\n are gonna be translated from one to 11.\n\n1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:30.900\n And the other half are gonna be translated\n\n1:10:30.900 --> 1:10:32.700\n from 12 to 16.\n\n1:10:32.700 --> 1:10:34.260\n It's gorgeous.\n\n1:10:34.260 --> 1:10:37.380\n And then you're done.\n\n1:10:37.380 --> 1:10:40.420\n Then that mRNA will never translate the last 10 proteins\n\n1:10:40.420 --> 1:10:42.540\n but spike is the one right after that one.\n\n1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:45.140\n So how does spike even get translated?\n\n1:10:45.140 --> 1:10:50.020\n This positive strand RNA virus has a reverse transcriptase\n\n1:10:50.020 --> 1:10:52.340\n which is an RNA based reverse transcriptase.\n\n1:10:52.340 --> 1:10:54.460\n So from the RNA on the positive strand,\n\n1:10:54.460 --> 1:10:56.940\n it makes an RNA on the negative strand.\n\n1:10:56.940 --> 1:10:59.620\n And in between every single one of these genes,\n\n1:10:59.620 --> 1:11:01.060\n these open reading frames,\n\n1:11:01.060 --> 1:11:05.580\n there's a little signal AACGCA or something like that,\n\n1:11:05.580 --> 1:11:09.940\n that basically loops over to the beginning of the RNA.\n\n1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:11.700\n And basically instead of sort of having\n\n1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:14.500\n a single full negative strand RNA,\n\n1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:16.860\n it basically has a partial negative strand RNA\n\n1:11:16.860 --> 1:11:19.700\n that ends right before the beginning of that gene.\n\n1:11:19.700 --> 1:11:20.860\n And another one that ends right before\n\n1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:21.980\n the beginning of that gene.\n\n1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:25.340\n These negative strand RNAs now make positive strand RNAs\n\n1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:27.460\n that then look to the human whole cell\n\n1:11:27.460 --> 1:11:29.780\n just like any other human mRNA.\n\n1:11:29.780 --> 1:11:31.780\n It's like, ooh, great, I'm gonna translate that one\n\n1:11:31.780 --> 1:11:32.980\n because it doesn't have the cleaving\n\n1:11:32.980 --> 1:11:36.340\n that the virus has now put on all your human genes.\n\n1:11:36.340 --> 1:11:38.300\n And then you've lost the battle.\n\n1:11:38.300 --> 1:11:42.500\n That cell is now only making proteins for the virus\n\n1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:45.500\n that will then create the spike protein,\n\n1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:47.620\n the envelope protein, the membrane protein,\n\n1:11:47.620 --> 1:11:50.380\n the nucleocapsid protein that will package up the RNA\n\n1:11:50.380 --> 1:11:53.820\n and then sort of create new viral envelopes.\n\n1:11:53.820 --> 1:11:57.780\n And these will then be secreted out of that cell\n\n1:11:57.780 --> 1:11:59.260\n in new little packages\n\n1:11:59.260 --> 1:12:00.580\n that will then infect the rest of the cells.\n\n1:12:00.580 --> 1:12:01.980\n Repeat the whole process again.\n\n1:12:01.980 --> 1:12:03.300\n It's beautiful, right?\n\n1:12:03.300 --> 1:12:04.140\n It's mind boggling.\n\n1:12:04.140 --> 1:12:05.620\n It's hard not to anthropomorphize it.\n\n1:12:05.620 --> 1:12:08.100\n I know, but it's so gorgeous.\n\n1:12:08.100 --> 1:12:09.900\n So there is a beauty to it.\n\n1:12:09.900 --> 1:12:10.740\n Of course.\n\n1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:13.980\n Is it terrifying to you?\n\n1:12:13.980 --> 1:12:16.940\n So this is something that has happened throughout history.\n\n1:12:16.940 --> 1:12:19.700\n Humans have been nearly wiped out\n\n1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:21.140\n over and over and over again,\n\n1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:23.260\n and yet never fully wiped out.\n\n1:12:23.260 --> 1:12:25.940\n So yeah, I'm not concerned about the human race.\n\n1:12:25.940 --> 1:12:29.340\n I'm not even concerned about the impact\n\n1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:32.460\n on sort of our survival as a species.\n\n1:12:33.780 --> 1:12:35.620\n This is absolutely something,\n\n1:12:35.620 --> 1:12:38.660\n I mean, human life is so invaluable\n\n1:12:38.660 --> 1:12:40.060\n and every one of us is so invaluable,\n\n1:12:40.060 --> 1:12:42.260\n but if you think of it as sort of,\n\n1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:44.100\n is this the end of our species?\n\n1:12:44.100 --> 1:12:46.420\n By no means, basically.\n\n1:12:46.420 --> 1:12:48.100\n So let me explain.\n\n1:12:48.100 --> 1:12:51.260\n The Black Death killed what, 30% of Europe?\n\n1:12:51.260 --> 1:12:55.260\n That has left a tremendous imprint,\n\n1:12:55.260 --> 1:12:59.260\n a huge hole, a horrendous hole\n\n1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:03.620\n in the genetic makeup of humans.\n\n1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:08.620\n There's been series of wiping out of huge fractions\n\n1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:12.180\n of entire species or just entire species altogether.\n\n1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:17.180\n And that has a consequence on the human immune repertoire.\n\n1:13:17.180 --> 1:13:20.860\n If you look at how Europe was shaped\n\n1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:24.700\n and how Africa was shaped by malaria, for example,\n\n1:13:24.700 --> 1:13:26.940\n all the individuals that carry a mutation\n\n1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:29.220\n that protects you from malaria\n\n1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:31.100\n were able to survive much more.\n\n1:13:31.100 --> 1:13:33.820\n And if you look at the frequency of sickle cell disease\n\n1:13:33.820 --> 1:13:35.580\n and the frequency of malaria,\n\n1:13:35.580 --> 1:13:38.340\n the maps are actually showing the same pattern,\n\n1:13:38.340 --> 1:13:40.420\n the same imprint on Africa.\n\n1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:42.340\n And that basically led people to hypothesize\n\n1:13:42.340 --> 1:13:43.860\n that the reason why sickle cell disease\n\n1:13:43.860 --> 1:13:45.660\n is so much more frequent is because\n\n1:13:45.660 --> 1:13:47.620\n sickle cell disease is so much more frequent\n\n1:13:47.620 --> 1:13:50.060\n in Americans of African descent\n\n1:13:50.060 --> 1:13:53.940\n is because there was selection in Africa against malaria\n\n1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:57.780\n leading to sickle cell, because when the cells sickle,\n\n1:13:57.780 --> 1:14:01.380\n malaria is not able to replicate inside your cells as well.\n\n1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:03.060\n And therefore you protect against that.\n\n1:14:03.060 --> 1:14:05.380\n So if you look at human disease,\n\n1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:07.540\n all of the genetic associations that we do\n\n1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:09.220\n with human disease,\n\n1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:13.620\n you basically see the imprint\n\n1:14:13.620 --> 1:14:16.620\n of these waves of selection killing off\n\n1:14:16.620 --> 1:14:18.300\n gazillions of humans.\n\n1:14:18.300 --> 1:14:23.180\n And there's so many immune processes that are coming up\n\n1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:25.900\n as associated with so many different diseases.\n\n1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:27.500\n The reason for that is similar\n\n1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:28.620\n to what I was describing earlier,\n\n1:14:28.620 --> 1:14:33.620\n where the outward facing proteins evolve much more rapidly\n\n1:14:33.620 --> 1:14:35.860\n because the environment is always changing.\n\n1:14:35.860 --> 1:14:37.620\n But what's really interesting in the human genome\n\n1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:40.340\n is that we have coopted many of these immune genes\n\n1:14:40.340 --> 1:14:42.420\n to carry out nonimmune functions.\n\n1:14:42.420 --> 1:14:43.980\n For example, in our brain,\n\n1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:48.860\n we use immune cells to cleave off neuronal connections\n\n1:14:48.860 --> 1:14:50.140\n that don't get used.\n\n1:14:50.140 --> 1:14:52.820\n This whole use it or lose it, we know the mechanism.\n\n1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:57.820\n It's microglia that cleave off neuronal synaptic connections\n\n1:14:57.820 --> 1:14:59.900\n that are just not utilized.\n\n1:14:59.900 --> 1:15:02.020\n When you utilize them, you mark them in a particular way\n\n1:15:02.020 --> 1:15:04.380\n that basically when the microglia come,\n\n1:15:04.380 --> 1:15:07.820\n tell it, don't kill this one, it's used now.\n\n1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:08.940\n And the microglia will go off\n\n1:15:08.940 --> 1:15:10.340\n and kill the ones you don't use.\n\n1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:12.780\n This is an immune function,\n\n1:15:12.780 --> 1:15:14.980\n which is coopted to do nonimmune things.\n\n1:15:14.980 --> 1:15:16.780\n If you look at our adipocytes,\n\n1:15:16.780 --> 1:15:19.900\n M1 versus M2 macrophages inside our fat\n\n1:15:19.900 --> 1:15:22.620\n will basically determine whether you're obese or not.\n\n1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:24.740\n And these are again, immune cells that are resident\n\n1:15:24.740 --> 1:15:27.060\n and living within these tissues.\n\n1:15:27.060 --> 1:15:30.220\n So many disease associations.\n\n1:15:30.220 --> 1:15:33.660\n That's it, that we coopt these kinds of things\n\n1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:36.660\n for incredibly complicated functions.\n\n1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:39.860\n Exactly, evolution works in so many different ways,\n\n1:15:39.860 --> 1:15:41.980\n which are all beautiful and mysterious.\n\n1:15:41.980 --> 1:15:43.340\n But not intelligent.\n\n1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:45.740\n Not intelligent, it's in the eye of the beholder.\n\n1:15:45.740 --> 1:15:50.740\n But the point that I'm trying to make is that\n\n1:15:51.060 --> 1:15:54.260\n if you look at the imprint that COVID will have,\n\n1:15:54.260 --> 1:15:55.980\n hopefully it will not be big.\n\n1:15:55.980 --> 1:15:57.980\n Hopefully the US will get attacked together\n\n1:15:57.980 --> 1:16:00.420\n and stop the virus from spreading further.\n\n1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:03.500\n But if it doesn't, it's having an imprint\n\n1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:07.340\n on individuals who have particular genetic repertoires.\n\n1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:10.060\n So if you look at now the genetic associations\n\n1:16:10.060 --> 1:16:13.620\n of blood type and immune function cells, et cetera,\n\n1:16:13.620 --> 1:16:15.740\n there's actually association, genetic variation\n\n1:16:15.740 --> 1:16:18.540\n that basically says how much more likely am I or you to die\n\n1:16:18.540 --> 1:16:20.220\n if we contact the virus.\n\n1:16:20.220 --> 1:16:24.540\n And it's through these rounds of shaping the human genome\n\n1:16:24.540 --> 1:16:27.380\n that humans have basically made it so far.\n\n1:16:27.380 --> 1:16:32.380\n And selection is ruthless and it's brutal\n\n1:16:32.620 --> 1:16:34.380\n and it only comes with a lot of killing.\n\n1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:38.140\n But this is the way that viruses and environments\n\n1:16:38.140 --> 1:16:39.540\n have shaped the human genome.\n\n1:16:39.540 --> 1:16:41.420\n Basically, when you go through periods of famine,\n\n1:16:41.420 --> 1:16:43.660\n you select for particular genes.\n\n1:16:43.660 --> 1:16:46.540\n And what's left is not necessarily better,\n\n1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:49.020\n it's just whatever survived.\n\n1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:51.980\n And it might have been the surviving one back then,\n\n1:16:51.980 --> 1:16:53.140\n not because it was better,\n\n1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:54.980\n maybe the ones that ran slower survived.\n\n1:16:54.980 --> 1:16:57.420\n I mean, again, not necessarily better,\n\n1:16:57.420 --> 1:17:00.020\n but the surviving ones are basically the ones\n\n1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:02.420\n that then are shaped for any kind\n\n1:17:02.420 --> 1:17:05.420\n of subsequent evolutionary condition\n\n1:17:05.420 --> 1:17:07.260\n and environmental condition.\n\n1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:09.580\n But if you look at, for example, obesity,\n\n1:17:09.580 --> 1:17:12.420\n obesity was selected for basically the genes\n\n1:17:12.420 --> 1:17:14.420\n that now predisposes to obesity\n\n1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:16.660\n were at 2% frequency in Africa.\n\n1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:19.020\n They rose to 44% frequency in Europe.\n\n1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:20.300\n Wow, that's fascinating.\n\n1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:22.940\n Because you basically went through the ice ages\n\n1:17:22.940 --> 1:17:24.620\n and there was a scarcity of food.\n\n1:17:24.620 --> 1:17:27.140\n So there was a selection to being able to store\n\n1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:29.260\n every single calorie you consume.\n\n1:17:29.260 --> 1:17:31.860\n Eventually, environment changes.\n\n1:17:31.860 --> 1:17:35.140\n So the better allele, which was the fat storing allele,\n\n1:17:35.140 --> 1:17:36.500\n became the worst allele\n\n1:17:36.500 --> 1:17:38.780\n because it's the fat storing allele.\n\n1:17:38.780 --> 1:17:40.940\n It still has the same function.\n\n1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:44.100\n So if you look at my genome, speaking of mom calling,\n\n1:17:44.100 --> 1:17:48.500\n mom gave me a bad copy of that gene, this FTO locus.\n\n1:17:48.500 --> 1:17:49.340\n Basically, makes me.\n\n1:17:49.340 --> 1:17:50.460\n The one that has to do with.\n\n1:17:50.460 --> 1:17:51.300\n Obesity.\n\n1:17:51.300 --> 1:17:52.140\n With obesity.\n\n1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:54.500\n Yeah, I basically now have a bad copy from mom\n\n1:17:54.500 --> 1:17:56.340\n that makes me more likely to be obese.\n\n1:17:56.340 --> 1:17:59.180\n And I also have a bad copy from dad\n\n1:17:59.180 --> 1:18:00.020\n that makes me more likely to be obese.\n\n1:18:00.020 --> 1:18:01.860\n So homozygous.\n\n1:18:01.860 --> 1:18:05.860\n And that's the allele, it's still the minor allele,\n\n1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:09.140\n but it's at 44% frequency in Southeast Asia,\n\n1:18:09.140 --> 1:18:12.740\n 42% frequency in Europe, even though it started at 2%.\n\n1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:16.060\n It was an awesome allele to have 100 years ago.\n\n1:18:16.060 --> 1:18:17.900\n Right now, it's pretty terrible allele.\n\n1:18:17.900 --> 1:18:21.980\n So the other concept is that diversity matters.\n\n1:18:21.980 --> 1:18:25.660\n If we had 100 million nuclear physicists\n\n1:18:25.660 --> 1:18:28.420\n living the earth right now, we'd be in trouble.\n\n1:18:28.420 --> 1:18:31.820\n You need diversity, you need artists\n\n1:18:31.820 --> 1:18:33.980\n and you need musicians and you need mathematicians\n\n1:18:33.980 --> 1:18:37.100\n and you need politicians, yes, even those.\n\n1:18:37.100 --> 1:18:37.940\n And you need like.\n\n1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:39.580\n Well, let's not get crazy.\n\n1:18:39.580 --> 1:18:43.100\n But because then if a virus comes along or whatever.\n\n1:18:43.100 --> 1:18:44.900\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:18:44.900 --> 1:18:45.980\n So, no, there's two reasons.\n\n1:18:45.980 --> 1:18:48.820\n Number one, you want diversity in the immune repertoire\n\n1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:50.820\n and we have built in diversity.\n\n1:18:50.820 --> 1:18:53.380\n So basically, they are the most diverse.\n\n1:18:53.380 --> 1:18:54.900\n Basically, if you look at our immune system,\n\n1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:57.100\n there's layers and layers of diversity.\n\n1:18:57.100 --> 1:19:01.540\n Like the way that you create your cells generates diversity\n\n1:19:01.540 --> 1:19:04.820\n because of the selection for the VDJ recombination\n\n1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:06.580\n that basically eventually leads\n\n1:19:06.580 --> 1:19:08.140\n to a huge number of repertoires.\n\n1:19:08.140 --> 1:19:10.220\n But that's only one small component of diversity.\n\n1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:11.540\n The blood type is another one.\n\n1:19:11.540 --> 1:19:15.900\n The major histocompatibility complex, the HLA alleles\n\n1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:18.020\n are another source of diversity.\n\n1:19:18.020 --> 1:19:21.660\n So the immune system of humans is by nature,\n\n1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:25.580\n incredibly diverse and that basically leads to resilience.\n\n1:19:25.580 --> 1:19:27.460\n So basically what I'm saying that I don't worry\n\n1:19:27.460 --> 1:19:32.460\n for the human species because we are so diverse immunologically,\n\n1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:34.860\n we are likely to be very resilient\n\n1:19:34.860 --> 1:19:39.020\n against so many different attacks like this current virus.\n\n1:19:39.020 --> 1:19:42.100\n So you're saying natural pandemics may not be something\n\n1:19:42.100 --> 1:19:45.180\n that you're really afraid of because of the diversity\n\n1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:48.380\n in our genetic makeup.\n\n1:19:48.380 --> 1:19:50.380\n What about engineered pandemics?\n\n1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:55.380\n Do you have fears of us messing with the makeup of viruses\n\n1:19:55.740 --> 1:19:58.860\n or well, yeah, let's say with the makeup of viruses\n\n1:19:58.860 --> 1:20:00.820\n to create something that we can't control\n\n1:20:00.820 --> 1:20:02.700\n and would be much more destructive\n\n1:20:02.700 --> 1:20:05.300\n than it would come about naturally?\n\n1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:08.020\n Remember how we were talking about how smart evolution is?\n\n1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:09.300\n Humans are much dumber.\n\n1:20:09.300 --> 1:20:10.140\n So.\n\n1:20:10.140 --> 1:20:11.860\n You mean like human scientists, engineers?\n\n1:20:11.860 --> 1:20:13.180\n Yeah, humans, humans just like.\n\n1:20:13.180 --> 1:20:14.020\n Humans overall?\n\n1:20:14.020 --> 1:20:14.860\n Yeah, humans overall.\n\n1:20:14.860 --> 1:20:15.700\n Okay.\n\n1:20:15.700 --> 1:20:19.660\n But I mean, even the sort of synthetic biologists\n\n1:20:19.660 --> 1:20:24.660\n you know, basically if you were to create,\n\n1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:29.700\n you know, virus like SARS that will kill a lot of people,\n\n1:20:29.700 --> 1:20:31.860\n you would probably start with SARS.\n\n1:20:32.860 --> 1:20:37.460\n So whoever, you know, would like to design such a thing\n\n1:20:37.460 --> 1:20:39.980\n would basically start with a SARS tree\n\n1:20:39.980 --> 1:20:42.460\n or at least some relative of SARS.\n\n1:20:42.460 --> 1:20:45.580\n The source genome for the current virus\n\n1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:47.140\n was something completely different.\n\n1:20:47.140 --> 1:20:49.100\n It was something that has never infected anyone\n\n1:20:49.100 --> 1:20:50.620\n and never infected humans.\n\n1:20:50.620 --> 1:20:52.900\n No one in their right mind would have started there.\n\n1:20:52.900 --> 1:20:55.020\n But when you say sources like the nearest.\n\n1:20:55.020 --> 1:20:56.260\n The nearest relative.\n\n1:20:56.260 --> 1:20:57.100\n Relative.\n\n1:20:57.100 --> 1:20:58.420\n Is in a whole other branch.\n\n1:20:58.420 --> 1:20:59.260\n Interesting.\n\n1:20:59.260 --> 1:21:00.980\n No species of which has ever infected humans\n\n1:21:00.980 --> 1:21:02.580\n in that branch.\n\n1:21:02.580 --> 1:21:05.340\n So, you know, let's put this to rest.\n\n1:21:05.340 --> 1:21:08.580\n This was not designed by someone to kill off the human race.\n\n1:21:08.580 --> 1:21:10.940\n So you don't believe it was engineered?\n\n1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:13.100\n The. Or likely.\n\n1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:16.140\n Yeah, the path to engineering a deadly virus\n\n1:21:16.140 --> 1:21:21.140\n did not come from this strain that was used.\n\n1:21:21.220 --> 1:21:26.220\n Moreover, there's been various claims of,\n\n1:21:26.940 --> 1:21:29.300\n ha ha, this was mixed and matched in lab\n\n1:21:29.300 --> 1:21:32.580\n because the S1 protein has three different components,\n\n1:21:32.580 --> 1:21:34.700\n each of which has a different evolutionary tree.\n\n1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:37.300\n So, you know, a lot of popular press basically said,\n\n1:21:37.300 --> 1:21:39.260\n aha, this came from pangolin\n\n1:21:39.260 --> 1:21:42.060\n and this came from, you know, all kinds of other species.\n\n1:21:42.980 --> 1:21:44.900\n This is what has been happening\n\n1:21:44.900 --> 1:21:46.900\n throughout the coronavirus tree.\n\n1:21:46.900 --> 1:21:49.380\n So basically the S1 protein has been recombining\n\n1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:50.420\n across species all the time.\n\n1:21:50.420 --> 1:21:52.020\n Remember when I was talking about the positive strand,\n\n1:21:52.020 --> 1:21:54.340\n the negative strand, sub genomic RNAs,\n\n1:21:54.340 --> 1:21:55.780\n these can actually recombine.\n\n1:21:55.780 --> 1:21:57.140\n And if you have two different viruses\n\n1:21:57.140 --> 1:21:58.540\n infecting the same cell,\n\n1:21:58.540 --> 1:21:59.780\n they can actually mix and match\n\n1:21:59.780 --> 1:22:01.340\n between the positive strand and the negative strand\n\n1:22:01.340 --> 1:22:04.700\n and basically create a new hybrid virus with recombination\n\n1:22:04.700 --> 1:22:06.700\n that now has the S1 from one\n\n1:22:06.700 --> 1:22:08.780\n and the rest of the genome from another.\n\n1:22:08.780 --> 1:22:10.580\n And this is something that happens a lot in S1,\n\n1:22:10.580 --> 1:22:12.060\n in Orfet, et cetera.\n\n1:22:12.060 --> 1:22:13.940\n And that's something that's true of the whole tree.\n\n1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:15.780\n For the whole family of viruses.\n\n1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:18.020\n So it's not like someone has been messing with this\n\n1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:20.860\n for millions of years and, you know, changing.\n\n1:22:20.860 --> 1:22:21.700\n This happens naturally.\n\n1:22:21.700 --> 1:22:24.420\n That's, again, beautiful that that somehow happens,\n\n1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:25.900\n that they recombine.\n\n1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:27.740\n So two different strands can infect the body\n\n1:22:27.740 --> 1:22:28.620\n and then recombine.\n\n1:22:30.460 --> 1:22:35.100\n So all of this actually magic happens inside hosts.\n\n1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:36.300\n Like all, like.\n\n1:22:36.300 --> 1:22:39.220\n Yeah, that's why classification wise,\n\n1:22:39.220 --> 1:22:40.700\n virus is not thought to be alive\n\n1:22:40.700 --> 1:22:41.940\n because it doesn't self replicate.\n\n1:22:41.940 --> 1:22:43.020\n It's not autonomous.\n\n1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:45.740\n It's something that enters a living cell\n\n1:22:45.740 --> 1:22:48.740\n and then co ops it to basically make it its own.\n\n1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:50.660\n But by itself, people ask me,\n\n1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:51.580\n how do we kill this bastard?\n\n1:22:51.580 --> 1:22:54.180\n I'm like, you stop it from replicating.\n\n1:22:54.180 --> 1:22:57.660\n It's not like a bacterium that will just live\n\n1:22:57.660 --> 1:23:01.060\n in a, you know, puddle or something.\n\n1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:02.460\n It's a virus.\n\n1:23:02.460 --> 1:23:04.420\n Viruses don't live without their host.\n\n1:23:04.420 --> 1:23:07.380\n And they only live with their host for very little time.\n\n1:23:07.380 --> 1:23:09.100\n So if you stop it from replicating,\n\n1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:11.260\n it'll stop from spreading.\n\n1:23:11.260 --> 1:23:13.220\n I mean, it's not like HIV, which can stay dormant\n\n1:23:13.220 --> 1:23:14.060\n for a long time.\n\n1:23:14.060 --> 1:23:15.580\n Basically, coronaviruses just don't do that.\n\n1:23:15.580 --> 1:23:16.780\n They're not integrating genomes.\n\n1:23:16.780 --> 1:23:18.060\n They're RNA genomes.\n\n1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:20.220\n So if it's not expressed, it degrades.\n\n1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:21.180\n RNA degrades.\n\n1:23:21.180 --> 1:23:23.380\n It doesn't just stick around.\n\n1:23:23.380 --> 1:23:27.340\n Well, let me ask also about the immune system you mentioned.\n\n1:23:27.340 --> 1:23:30.420\n A lot of people kind of ask, you know,\n\n1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:34.140\n how can we strengthen the immune system\n\n1:23:34.140 --> 1:23:36.300\n to respond to this particular virus,\n\n1:23:36.300 --> 1:23:37.740\n but the viruses in general.\n\n1:23:37.740 --> 1:23:40.420\n Do you have from a biological perspective,\n\n1:23:40.420 --> 1:23:43.140\n thoughts on what we can do as humans\n\n1:23:43.140 --> 1:23:43.980\n to strengthen our immune system?\n\n1:23:43.980 --> 1:23:46.620\n If you look at the death rates across different countries,\n\n1:23:46.620 --> 1:23:49.700\n people with less vaccination have been dying more.\n\n1:23:49.700 --> 1:23:51.380\n If you look at North Italy,\n\n1:23:51.380 --> 1:23:53.940\n the vaccination rates are abysmal there.\n\n1:23:53.940 --> 1:23:55.860\n And a lot of people have been dying.\n\n1:23:55.860 --> 1:23:58.780\n If you look at Greece, very good vaccination rates.\n\n1:23:58.780 --> 1:24:00.300\n Almost no one has been dying.\n\n1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:03.580\n So yes, there's a policy component.\n\n1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.980\n So Italy reacted very slowly.\n\n1:24:05.980 --> 1:24:07.460\n Greece reacted very fast.\n\n1:24:07.460 --> 1:24:09.780\n So yeah, many fewer people died in Greece,\n\n1:24:09.780 --> 1:24:11.740\n but there might actually be a component\n\n1:24:11.740 --> 1:24:14.100\n of genetic immune repertoire.\n\n1:24:14.100 --> 1:24:16.700\n Basically, how did people die off, you know,\n\n1:24:16.700 --> 1:24:19.020\n in the history of the Greek population\n\n1:24:19.020 --> 1:24:20.740\n versus the Italian population.\n\n1:24:20.740 --> 1:24:22.300\n Wow. There's a...\n\n1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:24.580\n That's interesting to think about.\n\n1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:25.980\n And then there's a component\n\n1:24:25.980 --> 1:24:28.940\n of what vaccinations did you have as a kid\n\n1:24:28.940 --> 1:24:32.460\n and what are the off target effects of those vaccinations?\n\n1:24:32.460 --> 1:24:34.900\n So basically a vaccination can have two components.\n\n1:24:34.900 --> 1:24:37.620\n One is training your immune system\n\n1:24:37.620 --> 1:24:39.500\n against that specific insult.\n\n1:24:39.500 --> 1:24:42.140\n The second one is boosting up your immune system\n\n1:24:42.140 --> 1:24:43.620\n for all kinds of other things.\n\n1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:47.100\n If you look at allergies,\n\n1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:50.220\n Northern Europe, super clean environments,\n\n1:24:50.220 --> 1:24:51.420\n tons of allergies.\n\n1:24:51.420 --> 1:24:54.020\n Southern Europe, my kids grew up eating dirt.\n\n1:24:54.980 --> 1:24:55.820\n No allergies.\n\n1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:00.420\n So growing up, I never had even heard of what allergies are.\n\n1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:01.940\n Like, was it really allergies?\n\n1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:03.580\n And the reason is that I was playing in the garden.\n\n1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:05.940\n I was putting all kinds of stuff in my mouth from,\n\n1:25:05.940 --> 1:25:07.380\n you know, all kinds of dirt and stuff,\n\n1:25:07.380 --> 1:25:09.620\n tons of viruses there, tons of bacteria there.\n\n1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:11.500\n You know, my immune system was built up.\n\n1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:16.500\n So the more you protect your immune system from exposure,\n\n1:25:16.700 --> 1:25:18.820\n the less opportunity it has to learn\n\n1:25:18.820 --> 1:25:23.100\n about non self repertoire in a way that prepares it\n\n1:25:23.100 --> 1:25:24.380\n for the next insult.\n\n1:25:24.380 --> 1:25:25.860\n So that's the horizontal thing too,\n\n1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:28.100\n like the, so it's throughout your lifetime\n\n1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:33.100\n and the lifetime of the people that, your ancestors,\n\n1:25:33.220 --> 1:25:34.060\n that kind of thing.\n\n1:25:34.060 --> 1:25:35.060\n What about the...\n\n1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:37.900\n So again, it returns against free will.\n\n1:25:37.900 --> 1:25:39.540\n On the free will side of things,\n\n1:25:39.540 --> 1:25:40.980\n is there something we could do\n\n1:25:40.980 --> 1:25:44.780\n to strengthen our immune system in 2020?\n\n1:25:44.780 --> 1:25:49.100\n Is there like, you know, exercise, diet,\n\n1:25:49.100 --> 1:25:50.700\n all that kind of stuff?\n\n1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:52.900\n So it's kind of funny.\n\n1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:55.940\n There's a cartoon that basically shows two windows\n\n1:25:55.940 --> 1:25:58.300\n with a teller in each window.\n\n1:25:58.300 --> 1:26:02.220\n One has a humongous line and the other one has no one.\n\n1:26:02.220 --> 1:26:04.700\n The one that has no one above says health.\n\n1:26:04.700 --> 1:26:07.220\n No, it says exercise and diet.\n\n1:26:07.220 --> 1:26:08.660\n And the other one says pill.\n\n1:26:10.300 --> 1:26:12.140\n And there's a huge line for pill.\n\n1:26:12.140 --> 1:26:13.940\n So we're looking basically for magic bullets\n\n1:26:13.940 --> 1:26:16.860\n for sort of ways that we can, you know,\n\n1:26:16.860 --> 1:26:18.980\n beat cancer and beat coronavirus and beat this\n\n1:26:18.980 --> 1:26:19.820\n and beat that.\n\n1:26:19.820 --> 1:26:21.420\n And it turns out that the window with like,\n\n1:26:21.420 --> 1:26:23.980\n just diet and exercise is the best way\n\n1:26:23.980 --> 1:26:26.100\n to boost every aspect of your health.\n\n1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:31.100\n If you look at Alzheimer's, exercise and nutrition.\n\n1:26:31.220 --> 1:26:32.580\n I mean, you're like, really?\n\n1:26:32.580 --> 1:26:34.700\n For my brain, neurodegeneration?\n\n1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:36.140\n Absolutely.\n\n1:26:36.140 --> 1:26:39.340\n If you look at cancer, exercise and nutrition.\n\n1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:43.780\n If you look at coronavirus, exercise and nutrition,\n\n1:26:43.780 --> 1:26:47.300\n every single aspect of human health gets improved.\n\n1:26:47.300 --> 1:26:48.620\n And one of the studies we're doing now\n\n1:26:48.620 --> 1:26:51.260\n is basically looking at what are the effects\n\n1:26:51.260 --> 1:26:52.940\n of diet and exercise?\n\n1:26:52.940 --> 1:26:55.340\n How similar are they to each other?\n\n1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:58.220\n We basically take in diet intervention\n\n1:26:58.220 --> 1:27:01.380\n and exercise intervention in human and in mice.\n\n1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:03.580\n And we're basically doing single cell profiling\n\n1:27:03.580 --> 1:27:04.980\n of a bunch of different tissues\n\n1:27:04.980 --> 1:27:08.020\n to basically understand how are the cells,\n\n1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:10.900\n both the stromal cells and the immune cells\n\n1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:13.260\n of each of these tissues responding\n\n1:27:13.260 --> 1:27:15.100\n to the effect of exercise.\n\n1:27:15.100 --> 1:27:16.900\n What are the communication networks\n\n1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:18.540\n between different cells?\n\n1:27:18.540 --> 1:27:23.540\n Where the muscle that exercises sends signals\n\n1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:25.980\n through the bloodstream, through the lymphatic system,\n\n1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:27.660\n through all kinds of other systems\n\n1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:31.580\n that give signals to other cells that I have exercised\n\n1:27:31.580 --> 1:27:33.980\n and you should change in this particular way,\n\n1:27:33.980 --> 1:27:37.620\n which basically reconfigure those receptor cells\n\n1:27:37.620 --> 1:27:39.860\n with the effect of exercise.\n\n1:27:39.860 --> 1:27:43.860\n How well understood is those reconfigurations?\n\n1:27:43.860 --> 1:27:44.700\n Very little.\n\n1:27:44.700 --> 1:27:46.940\n We're just starting now, basically.\n\n1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:51.020\n Is the hope there to understand the effect on,\n\n1:27:52.420 --> 1:27:54.300\n so like the effect on the immune system?\n\n1:27:54.300 --> 1:27:56.220\n On the immune system, the effect on brain,\n\n1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:59.060\n the effect on your liver, on your digestive system,\n\n1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:00.900\n on your adipocytes?\n\n1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:03.620\n Adipose, the most misunderstood organ.\n\n1:28:03.620 --> 1:28:05.780\n Everybody thinks, oh, fat, terrible.\n\n1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:07.460\n No, fat is awesome.\n\n1:28:07.460 --> 1:28:09.940\n Your fat cells is what's keeping you alive\n\n1:28:09.940 --> 1:28:11.420\n because if you didn't have your fat cells,\n\n1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:13.940\n all those lipids and all those calories\n\n1:28:13.940 --> 1:28:15.420\n would be floating around in your blood\n\n1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:16.940\n and you'd be dead by now.\n\n1:28:16.940 --> 1:28:18.460\n Your adipocytes are your best friend.\n\n1:28:18.460 --> 1:28:21.820\n They're basically storing all these excess calories\n\n1:28:21.820 --> 1:28:24.900\n so that they don't hurt all of the rest of the body.\n\n1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:28.940\n And they're also fat burning in many ways.\n\n1:28:28.940 --> 1:28:31.540\n So, again, when you don't have\n\n1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:33.460\n the homozygous version that I have,\n\n1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:36.500\n your cells are able to burn calories much more easily\n\n1:28:36.500 --> 1:28:39.980\n by sort of flipping a master metabolic switch\n\n1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:42.380\n that involves this FTO locus that I mentioned earlier\n\n1:28:42.380 --> 1:28:45.060\n and its target genes, RX3 and RX5,\n\n1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:47.540\n that basically switch your adipocytes\n\n1:28:47.540 --> 1:28:50.780\n during their three first days of differentiation\n\n1:28:50.780 --> 1:28:52.300\n as they're becoming mature adipocytes\n\n1:28:52.300 --> 1:28:54.340\n to basically become either fat burning\n\n1:28:54.340 --> 1:28:57.100\n or fat storing fat cells.\n\n1:28:57.100 --> 1:28:58.980\n And the fat burning fat cells are your best friend.\n\n1:28:58.980 --> 1:29:00.460\n They're much closer to muscle\n\n1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:02.820\n than they are to white adipocytes.\n\n1:29:02.820 --> 1:29:05.340\n Is there a lot of difference between people\n\n1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:09.540\n that you could give, science could eventually give advice\n\n1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:12.260\n that is very generalizable\n\n1:29:12.260 --> 1:29:16.100\n or is our differences in our genetic makeup,\n\n1:29:16.100 --> 1:29:18.700\n like you mentioned, is that going to be basically\n\n1:29:18.700 --> 1:29:22.800\n something we have to be very specialized individuals,\n\n1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:24.900\n any advice we give in terms of diet,\n\n1:29:24.900 --> 1:29:25.740\n like what we were just talking about?\n\n1:29:25.740 --> 1:29:28.380\n Believe it or not, the most personalized advice\n\n1:29:28.380 --> 1:29:29.620\n that you give for nutrition\n\n1:29:29.620 --> 1:29:31.460\n don't have to do with your genome.\n\n1:29:31.460 --> 1:29:34.420\n They have to do with your gut microbiome,\n\n1:29:34.420 --> 1:29:35.900\n with the bacteria that live inside you.\n\n1:29:35.900 --> 1:29:37.940\n So most of your digestion is actually happening\n\n1:29:37.940 --> 1:29:40.800\n by species that are not human inside you.\n\n1:29:40.800 --> 1:29:43.060\n You have more nonhuman cells than you have human cells.\n\n1:29:43.060 --> 1:29:46.740\n You're basically a giant bag of bacteria\n\n1:29:46.740 --> 1:29:48.320\n with a few human cells along.\n\n1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:53.120\n And those do not necessarily have to do\n\n1:29:53.120 --> 1:29:54.900\n with your genetic makeup.\n\n1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:56.760\n They interact with your genetic makeup.\n\n1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:58.000\n They interact with your epigenome.\n\n1:29:58.000 --> 1:29:59.600\n They interact with your nutrition.\n\n1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:01.280\n They interact with your environment.\n\n1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:06.280\n They're basically an additional source of variation.\n\n1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:08.120\n So when you're thinking about sort of\n\n1:30:08.120 --> 1:30:10.080\n personalized nutritional advice,\n\n1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:13.640\n part of that is actually how do you match your microbiome?\n\n1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:17.080\n And part of that is how do we match your genetics?\n\n1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:22.080\n But again, this is a very diverse set of contributors.\n\n1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:24.640\n And the effect sizes are not enormous.\n\n1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:27.920\n So I think the science for that is not fully developed yet.\n\n1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:28.760\n Speaking of diets,\n\n1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:30.640\n because I've wrestled in combat sports,\n\n1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:32.640\n but sports my whole life were weight matters.\n\n1:30:32.640 --> 1:30:35.340\n So you have to cut and all that stuff.\n\n1:30:35.340 --> 1:30:38.240\n One thing I've learned a lot about my body,\n\n1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:39.900\n and it seems to be, I think,\n\n1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:41.680\n true about other people's bodies,\n\n1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:45.120\n is that you can adjust to a lot of things.\n\n1:30:45.120 --> 1:30:48.280\n That's the miraculous thing about this biological system,\n\n1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:52.360\n is like I fast often.\n\n1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:54.920\n I used to eat like five, six times a day\n\n1:30:54.920 --> 1:30:57.020\n and thought that was absolutely necessary.\n\n1:30:57.020 --> 1:30:58.960\n How could you not eat that often?\n\n1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:01.320\n And then when I started fasting,\n\n1:31:01.320 --> 1:31:02.720\n your body adjusted to that.\n\n1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:04.360\n And you learn how to not eat.\n\n1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:07.600\n And it was, if you just give it a chance\n\n1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:09.140\n for a few weeks, actually,\n\n1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:10.320\n over a period of a few weeks,\n\n1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:11.800\n your body can adjust to anything.\n\n1:31:11.800 --> 1:31:14.120\n And that's a miraculous, that's such a beautiful thing.\n\n1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:15.480\n So I'm a computer scientist,\n\n1:31:15.480 --> 1:31:18.040\n and I've basically gone through periods of 24 hours\n\n1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:19.680\n without eating or stopping.\n\n1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:22.080\n And then I'm like, oh, must eat.\n\n1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:23.080\n And I eat a ton.\n\n1:31:23.080 --> 1:31:25.440\n I used to order two pizzas just with my brother.\n\n1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:29.720\n So I've gone through these extremes as well,\n\n1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:32.160\n and I've gone the whole intermittent fasting thing.\n\n1:31:32.160 --> 1:31:35.200\n So I can sympathize with you both on the seven meals a day\n\n1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:37.580\n to the zero meals a day.\n\n1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:40.820\n So I think when I say everything with moderation,\n\n1:31:40.820 --> 1:31:44.400\n I actually think your body responds interestingly\n\n1:31:44.400 --> 1:31:47.400\n to these different changes in diet.\n\n1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:49.920\n I think part of the reason why we lose weight\n\n1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:52.220\n with pretty much every kind of change in behavior\n\n1:31:52.220 --> 1:31:55.960\n is because our epigenome and the set of proteins\n\n1:31:55.960 --> 1:31:58.640\n and enzymes that are expressed and our microbiome\n\n1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:02.080\n are not well suited to that nutritional source.\n\n1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:03.880\n And therefore, they will not be able\n\n1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:06.680\n to sort of catch everything that you give them.\n\n1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:09.160\n And then a lot of that will go undigested.\n\n1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:11.920\n And that basically means that your body can then\n\n1:32:11.920 --> 1:32:13.200\n lose weight in the short term,\n\n1:32:13.200 --> 1:32:16.160\n but very quickly will adjust to that new normal.\n\n1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:18.200\n And then we'll be able to sort of perhaps gain\n\n1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:20.400\n a lot of weight from the diet.\n\n1:32:20.400 --> 1:32:24.400\n So anyway, I mean, there's also studies in factories\n\n1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:27.200\n where basically people dim the lights\n\n1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:28.720\n and then suddenly everybody started working better.\n\n1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:30.160\n It was like, wow, that's amazing.\n\n1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:32.840\n Three weeks later, they made the lights a little brighter.\n\n1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:34.360\n Everybody started working better.\n\n1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:39.360\n So any kind of intervention has a placebo effect of,\n\n1:32:39.440 --> 1:32:41.320\n wow, now I'm healthier and I'm gonna be running\n\n1:32:41.320 --> 1:32:42.160\n more often, et cetera.\n\n1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:44.600\n So it's very hard to uncouple the placebo effect\n\n1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:47.080\n of, wow, I'm doing something to intervene on my diet\n\n1:32:47.080 --> 1:32:50.280\n from the, wow, this is actually the right thing for me.\n\n1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:51.120\n So, you know.\n\n1:32:51.120 --> 1:32:53.200\n Yeah, from the perspective from a nutrition science,\n\n1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:55.760\n psychology, both things I'm interested in,\n\n1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:59.560\n especially psychology, it seems that it's extremely difficult\n\n1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:03.440\n to do good science because there's so many variables\n\n1:33:03.440 --> 1:33:06.560\n involved, it's so difficult to control the variables,\n\n1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:10.280\n so difficult to do sufficiently large scale experiments,\n\n1:33:10.280 --> 1:33:12.840\n both sort of in terms of the number of subjects\n\n1:33:12.840 --> 1:33:17.040\n and temporal, like how long you do the study for,\n\n1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:20.720\n that it just seems like it's not even a real science\n\n1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:22.640\n for now, like nutrition science.\n\n1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:24.840\n I wanna jump into the whole placebo effect\n\n1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:25.840\n for a little bit here.\n\n1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:30.200\n And basically talk about the implications of that.\n\n1:33:30.200 --> 1:33:33.400\n If I give you a sugar pill and I tell you it's a sugar pill,\n\n1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:35.520\n you won't get any better.\n\n1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:38.240\n But if I tell you a sugar pill and I tell you,\n\n1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:40.000\n wow, this is an amazing drug,\n\n1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.240\n it actually will stop your cancer,\n\n1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:46.280\n your cancer will actually stop with much higher probability.\n\n1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:47.120\n What does that mean?\n\n1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:47.960\n That's so amazing.\n\n1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:49.920\n That means that if I can trick your brain\n\n1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:51.840\n into thinking that I'm healing you,\n\n1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:54.560\n your brain will basically figure out a way to heal itself,\n\n1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:55.920\n to heal the body.\n\n1:33:55.920 --> 1:33:58.600\n And that tells us that there's so much\n\n1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:01.440\n that we don't understand in the interplay\n\n1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:04.200\n between our cognition and our biology,\n\n1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:08.400\n that if we were able to better harvest\n\n1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:12.320\n the power of our brain to sort of impact the body\n\n1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:14.200\n through the placebo effect,\n\n1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:17.280\n we would be so much better in so many different things.\n\n1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:19.200\n Just by tricking yourself into thinking\n\n1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:21.560\n that you're doing better, you're actually doing better.\n\n1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:22.640\n So there's something to be said\n\n1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:25.040\n about sort of positive thinking, about optimism,\n\n1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:30.040\n about sort of just getting your brain\n\n1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:33.000\n and your mind into the right mindset\n\n1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.920\n that helps your body and helps your entire biology.\n\n1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:39.840\n Yeah, from a science perspective, that's just fascinating.\n\n1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:41.600\n Obviously most things about the brain\n\n1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:43.640\n is a total mystery for now,\n\n1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:46.160\n but that's a fascinating interplay\n\n1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:51.160\n that the brain can help cure cancer.\n\n1:34:54.240 --> 1:34:55.840\n I don't even know what to do with that.\n\n1:34:55.840 --> 1:34:59.120\n I mean, the way to think about that is the following.\n\n1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:01.240\n The converse of the equation is something\n\n1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:03.120\n that we are much more comfortable with.\n\n1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:05.720\n Like, oh, if you're stressed,\n\n1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:08.200\n then your heart rate might rise\n\n1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:10.960\n and all kinds of sort of toxins might be released\n\n1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:13.600\n and that can have a detrimental effect in your body,\n\n1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:14.800\n et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:18.080\n So maybe it's easier to understand your body\n\n1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:20.040\n healing from your mind\n\n1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:23.040\n by your mind is not killing your body,\n\n1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:24.560\n or at least it's killing it less.\n\n1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:28.000\n So I think that aspect of the stress equation\n\n1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.800\n is a little easier for most of us to conceptualize,\n\n1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:35.160\n but then the healing part is perhaps the same pathways,\n\n1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:36.160\n perhaps different pathways,\n\n1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:39.520\n but again, something that is totally untapped scientifically.\n\n1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:42.920\n I think we try to bring this question up a couple of times,\n\n1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:44.640\n but let's return to it again,\n\n1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:46.440\n is what do you think is the difference\n\n1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:49.480\n between the way a computer represents information,\n\n1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:53.120\n the human genome represents and stores information?\n\n1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:55.560\n And maybe broadly, what is the difference\n\n1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:57.840\n between how you think about computers\n\n1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:00.400\n and how you think about biological systems?\n\n1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:02.520\n So I made a very provocative claim earlier\n\n1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:04.360\n that we are a digital computer.\n\n1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:06.360\n Like I said, at the core lies a digital code\n\n1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:07.520\n and that's true in many ways,\n\n1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:09.480\n but surrounding that digital core,\n\n1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:11.440\n there's a huge amount of analog.\n\n1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:13.680\n If you look at our brain, it's not really digital.\n\n1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:15.760\n If you look at our sort of RNA\n\n1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:17.160\n and all of that stuff inside our cell,\n\n1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:18.000\n it's not really digital.\n\n1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:19.840\n It's really analog in many ways,\n\n1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.800\n but let's start with the code\n\n1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:24.800\n and then we'll expand to the rest.\n\n1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:27.800\n So the code itself is digital.\n\n1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:28.680\n So there's genes.\n\n1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:30.840\n You can think of the genes as, I don't know,\n\n1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:33.840\n the procedures, the functions inside your language.\n\n1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:36.400\n And then somehow you have to turn these functions on.\n\n1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:37.320\n How do you call a gene?\n\n1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:39.360\n How do you call that function?\n\n1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:41.880\n The way that you would do it in old programming languages\n\n1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:44.560\n is go to address whatever in your memory\n\n1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:46.240\n and then you'd start running from there.\n\n1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:48.920\n And modern programming languages\n\n1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:50.800\n have encapsulated this into functions\n\n1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.000\n and objects and all of that.\n\n1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.560\n And it's nice and cute, but in the end, deep down,\n\n1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:55.560\n there's still an assembly code\n\n1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:57.600\n that says go to that instruction\n\n1:36:57.600 --> 1:36:59.680\n and it runs that instruction.\n\n1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:01.600\n If you look at the human genome\n\n1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:05.000\n and the genome of pretty much most species out there,\n\n1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:08.160\n there's no go to function.\n\n1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:12.520\n You just don't start transcribing in position 13,000,\n\n1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:18.760\n 13,527 in chromosome 12.\n\n1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:21.920\n You instead have content based indexing.\n\n1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:25.120\n So at every location in the genome,\n\n1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:28.760\n in front of the genes that need to be turned on,\n\n1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:30.560\n I don't know, when you drink coffee,\n\n1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:34.440\n there's a little coffee marker in front of all of them.\n\n1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:38.480\n And whenever your cells that metabolize coffee\n\n1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:39.760\n need to metabolize coffee,\n\n1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:41.280\n they basically see coffee and they're like,\n\n1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:44.720\n ooh, let's go turn on all the coffee marked genes.\n\n1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:48.040\n So there's basically these small motifs,\n\n1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:50.840\n these small sequences that we call regulatory motifs.\n\n1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:52.040\n They're like patterns of DNA.\n\n1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:54.680\n They're only eight characters long or so,\n\n1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:57.040\n like GAT, GCA, et cetera.\n\n1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:01.560\n And these motifs work in combinations\n\n1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:06.320\n and every one of them has some recruitment affinity\n\n1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:09.520\n for a different protein that will then come and bind it\n\n1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:11.840\n and together collections of these motifs\n\n1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:15.440\n create regions that we call regulatory regions\n\n1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:19.280\n that can be either promoters near the beginning of the gene\n\n1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:20.160\n and that basically tells you\n\n1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:22.480\n where the function actually starts, where you call it,\n\n1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.200\n and then enhancers that are looping around of the DNA\n\n1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:28.200\n that basically bring the machinery\n\n1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:29.800\n that binds those enhancers\n\n1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:32.520\n and then bring it onto the promoter,\n\n1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:36.080\n which then recruits the right sort of the ribosome\n\n1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:37.800\n and the polymerase and all of that thing,\n\n1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:40.560\n which will first transcribe and then export\n\n1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:42.680\n and then eventually translate in the cytoplasm,\n\n1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:44.480\n you know, whatever RNA molecule.\n\n1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:50.520\n So the beauty of the way\n\n1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:54.280\n that the digital computer that's the genome works\n\n1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:57.960\n is that it's extremely fault tolerant.\n\n1:38:57.960 --> 1:38:59.480\n If I took your hard drive\n\n1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:03.160\n and I messed with 20% of the letters in it,\n\n1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:05.880\n of the zeros and ones and I flipped them,\n\n1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:07.400\n you'd be in trouble.\n\n1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:10.320\n If I take the genome and I flipped 20% of the letters,\n\n1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:12.960\n you probably won't even notice.\n\n1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:15.320\n And that resilience.\n\n1:39:15.320 --> 1:39:16.720\n That's fascinating, yeah.\n\n1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:18.840\n Is a key design principle.\n\n1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:20.760\n And again, I'm anthropomorphizing here,\n\n1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:22.400\n but it's a key driving principle\n\n1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:24.320\n of how biological systems work.\n\n1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:27.880\n They're first resilient and then anything else.\n\n1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:32.160\n And when you look at this incredible beauty of life\n\n1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:35.480\n from the most, I don't know, beautiful,\n\n1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:38.280\n I don't know, human genome maybe of humanity\n\n1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:40.840\n and all of the ideals that should come with it\n\n1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:42.360\n to the most terrifying genome,\n\n1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:45.520\n like, I don't know, COVID 19, SARS COVID 2\n\n1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:47.640\n and the current pandemic,\n\n1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:50.280\n you basically see this elegance\n\n1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:54.520\n as the epitome of clean design,\n\n1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:55.920\n but it's dirty.\n\n1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:57.280\n It's a mess.\n\n1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:02.200\n It's, you know, the way to get there is hugely messy.\n\n1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:04.400\n And that's something that we as computer scientists\n\n1:40:04.400 --> 1:40:06.120\n don't embrace.\n\n1:40:06.120 --> 1:40:08.040\n We like to have clean code.\n\n1:40:08.040 --> 1:40:10.360\n You know, like in engineering,\n\n1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:12.240\n they teach you about compartmentalization,\n\n1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:13.720\n about sort of separating functions,\n\n1:40:13.720 --> 1:40:17.080\n about modularity, about hierarchical design.\n\n1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:19.040\n None of that applies in biology.\n\n1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:19.880\n Testing.\n\n1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:22.320\n Testing, sure.\n\n1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:24.200\n Yeah, biology does plenty of that.\n\n1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:26.800\n But I mean, through evolutionary exploration.\n\n1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:31.040\n But if you look at biological systems,\n\n1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:33.440\n first they are robust\n\n1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:36.680\n and then they specialize to become anything else.\n\n1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:38.240\n And if you look at viruses,\n\n1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:41.040\n the reason why they're so elegant\n\n1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:44.600\n when you look at the design of this, you know, genome,\n\n1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:46.120\n it seems so elegant.\n\n1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:49.680\n And the reason for that is that it's been stripped down\n\n1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:51.600\n from something much larger\n\n1:40:51.600 --> 1:40:53.960\n because of the pressure to keep it compact.\n\n1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:56.040\n So many compact genomes out there\n\n1:40:56.040 --> 1:40:58.680\n have ancestors that were much larger.\n\n1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:00.760\n You don't start small and become big.\n\n1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:03.640\n You go through a loop of add a bunch of stuff,\n\n1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:07.240\n increase complexity, and then, you know, slim it down.\n\n1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:12.120\n And one of my early papers was in fact on genome duplication.\n\n1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:14.080\n One of the things we found is that baker's yeast,\n\n1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:17.600\n which is the, you know, yeast that you use to make bread,\n\n1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:19.480\n but also the yeast that you use to make wine,\n\n1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:20.960\n which is basically the dominant species\n\n1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:22.360\n when you go in the fields of Tuscany\n\n1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:24.040\n and you say, you know, what's out there,\n\n1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:26.320\n it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae,\n\n1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:27.880\n or the way my Italian friends say,\n\n1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:30.120\n saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\n1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:33.000\n So, so.\n\n1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:34.480\n Oh, which means what?\n\n1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:36.680\n Oh, saccharomyces, okay, I'm sorry, I'm Greek.\n\n1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:39.680\n So yeah, zacharo, mikis, zacharo is sugar,\n\n1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:41.120\n mikis is fungus.\n\n1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:44.520\n Yes, cerevisiae, cerveza, beer.\n\n1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:47.200\n So it means the sugar fungus of beer.\n\n1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:48.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:51.080\n You know, less, less sounding to the ear.\n\n1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:52.840\n Still poetic, yeah.\n\n1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:54.960\n So anyway, saccharomyces cerevisiae,\n\n1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:57.040\n basically the major baker's yeast out there\n\n1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:00.440\n is the descendant of a whole genome duplication.\n\n1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:02.880\n Why would a whole gene duplication even happen?\n\n1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:06.080\n When it happened is coinciding\n\n1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:08.240\n with about a hundred million years ago\n\n1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:12.920\n and the emergence of fruit bearing plants.\n\n1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:15.560\n Why fruit bearing plants?\n\n1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:19.040\n Because animals would eat the fruit\n\n1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:23.640\n and would walk around and poop huge amounts of nutrients\n\n1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:26.480\n along with a seed for the plants to spread.\n\n1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:29.000\n Before that, plants were not spreading through animals,\n\n1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:30.480\n they were spreading through wind\n\n1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:32.360\n and all kinds of other ways.\n\n1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.720\n But basically the moment you have fruit bearing plants,\n\n1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:38.760\n these plants are basically creating this abundance\n\n1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:40.240\n of sugar in the environment.\n\n1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:42.920\n So there's an evolutionary niche that gets created.\n\n1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:44.080\n And in that evolutionary niche,\n\n1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:46.640\n you basically have enough sugar\n\n1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:48.680\n that a whole genome duplication,\n\n1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:51.040\n which initially is a very messy event,\n\n1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:53.760\n allows you to then, you know,\n\n1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:56.000\n relieve some of that complexity.\n\n1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:59.520\n So I had to pause, what does genome duplication mean?\n\n1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:03.200\n That basically means that instead of having eight chromosomes,\n\n1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:04.920\n you can now have 16 chromosomes.\n\n1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:09.600\n So, but the duplication at first,\n\n1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:13.760\n when you go to 16, you're not using that.\n\n1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:15.120\n Oh yeah, you are.\n\n1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:17.280\n Yeah, so basically from one day to the next,\n\n1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:18.600\n you went from having eight chromosomes\n\n1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:20.280\n to having 16 chromosomes.\n\n1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:22.920\n Probably a non disjunction event during a duplication,\n\n1:43:22.920 --> 1:43:24.160\n during a division.\n\n1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:25.800\n So you basically divide the cell\n\n1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:27.760\n instead of half the genome going this way\n\n1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:29.000\n and half the genome going the other way\n\n1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:30.640\n after duplication of the genome,\n\n1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:33.000\n you basically have all of it going to one cell\n\n1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.840\n and then there's sufficient messiness there\n\n1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:38.320\n that you end up with slight differences\n\n1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:39.760\n that make most of these chromosomes\n\n1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:40.920\n be actually preserved.\n\n1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:43.120\n It's a long story short to me.\n\n1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:45.000\n But that's a big upgrade, right?\n\n1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:45.840\n So that's...\n\n1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:46.760\n Not necessarily,\n\n1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:48.480\n because what happens immediately thereafter\n\n1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:50.320\n is that you start massively losing\n\n1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:52.280\n tons of those duplicated genes.\n\n1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:55.360\n So 90% of those genes were actually lost\n\n1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:58.160\n very rapidly after whole gene duplication.\n\n1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:01.680\n And the reason for that is that biology is not intelligent,\n\n1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:06.480\n it's just ruthless selection, random mutation.\n\n1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:08.520\n So the ruthless selection basically means\n\n1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:11.400\n that as soon as one of the random mutations hit one gene,\n\n1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:13.360\n ruthless selection just kills off that gene.\n\n1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:14.200\n It's just,\n\n1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:19.520\n if you have a pressure to maintain a small compact genome,\n\n1:44:19.520 --> 1:44:21.680\n you will very rapidly lose the second copy\n\n1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:24.240\n of most of your genes and a small number 10%\n\n1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:25.720\n were kept in two copies.\n\n1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:28.800\n And those had to do a lot with environment adaptation,\n\n1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:31.080\n with the speed of replication,\n\n1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:34.240\n with the speed of translation and with sugar processing.\n\n1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:36.000\n So I'm making a long story short\n\n1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.720\n to basically say that evolution is messy.\n\n1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:39.960\n The only way...\n\n1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:42.160\n Like, so the example that I was giving\n\n1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:45.840\n of messing with 20% of your bits in your computer,\n\n1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:47.200\n totally bogus.\n\n1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:48.720\n Duplicating all your functions\n\n1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:51.880\n and just throwing them out there in the same function,\n\n1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:52.840\n just totally bogus.\n\n1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:55.200\n Like this would never work in an engineer system.\n\n1:44:55.200 --> 1:44:56.960\n But biological systems,\n\n1:44:56.960 --> 1:44:59.080\n because of this content based indexing\n\n1:44:59.080 --> 1:45:01.880\n and because of this modularity that comes\n\n1:45:01.880 --> 1:45:04.200\n from the fact that the gene is controlled\n\n1:45:04.200 --> 1:45:05.200\n by a series of tags.\n\n1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:08.160\n And now if you need this gene in another setting,\n\n1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:09.760\n you just add some more tags\n\n1:45:09.760 --> 1:45:12.560\n that will basically turn it on also in those settings.\n\n1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:17.280\n So this gene is now pressured to do two different functions\n\n1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:19.760\n and it builds up complexity.\n\n1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:21.240\n I see a whole gene duplication\n\n1:45:21.240 --> 1:45:22.560\n and gene duplication in general\n\n1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:24.560\n as a way to relieve that complexity.\n\n1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:26.640\n So you have this gradual buildup of complexity\n\n1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:30.920\n as functions get sort of added onto the existing genes.\n\n1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:34.160\n And then boom, you duplicate your workforce.\n\n1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:36.720\n And you now have two copies of this gene.\n\n1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:38.760\n One will probably specialize to do one\n\n1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:40.440\n and the other one will specialize to do the other\n\n1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:42.160\n or one will maintain the ancestral function.\n\n1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:44.800\n The other one will sort of be free to evolve\n\n1:45:44.800 --> 1:45:47.720\n and specialize while losing the ancestral function\n\n1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:48.640\n and so on and so forth.\n\n1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:49.960\n So that's how genomes evolve.\n\n1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:52.040\n They're just messy things,\n\n1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:54.600\n but they're extremely fault tolerant\n\n1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:58.400\n and they're extremely able to deal with mutations\n\n1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:03.400\n because that's the very way that you generate new functions.\n\n1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.440\n So new functionalization comes\n\n1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:07.720\n from the very thing that breaks it.\n\n1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:09.120\n So even in the current pandemic,\n\n1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:12.560\n many people are asking me which mutations matter the most.\n\n1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:13.800\n And what I tell them is,\n\n1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:16.240\n well, we can study the evolutionary dynamics\n\n1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:19.520\n of the current genome to then understand\n\n1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:23.120\n which mutations have previously happened or not.\n\n1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:26.040\n And which mutations happen in genes\n\n1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:28.040\n that evolve rapidly or not.\n\n1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:29.720\n And one of the things we found, for example,\n\n1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:33.840\n is that the genes that evolved rapidly in the past\n\n1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:36.720\n are still evolving rapidly now in the current pandemic.\n\n1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:38.680\n The genes that evolved slowly in the past\n\n1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:40.040\n are still evolving slowly.\n\n1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:41.720\n Which means that they're useful?\n\n1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:43.360\n Which means that they're under\n\n1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:45.280\n the same evolutionary pressures.\n\n1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:49.440\n But then the question is what happens in specific mutations?\n\n1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:52.560\n So if you look at the D614 gene mutations,\n\n1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:53.840\n that's been all over the news.\n\n1:46:53.840 --> 1:46:58.840\n So in position 614, in the amino acids 614 of the S protein,\n\n1:46:59.720 --> 1:47:02.120\n there's a D2 gene mutation\n\n1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:05.840\n that sort of has creeped over the population.\n\n1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:10.040\n That mutation, we found out through my work,\n\n1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:13.480\n disrupts a perfectly conserved nucleotide position\n\n1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:15.800\n that has never been changed in the history\n\n1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:17.920\n of millions of years of equivalent\n\n1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:22.920\n per million evolution of these viruses.\n\n1:47:23.080 --> 1:47:25.960\n That basically means that it's a completely new adaptation\n\n1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:27.480\n to human.\n\n1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:30.840\n And that mutation has now gone from 1% frequency\n\n1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:33.800\n to 90% frequency in almost all outbreaks.\n\n1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:38.800\n So this mutation, I like how you say the 416,\n\n1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:39.720\n what was it, okay.\n\n1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:40.640\n Yeah, 614, sorry.\n\n1:47:40.640 --> 1:47:41.480\n 614.\n\n1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.200\n D614G.\n\n1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:46.560\n D614, so literally, so what you're saying\n\n1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:48.440\n is this is like a chess move.\n\n1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:50.560\n So it just mutated one letter to another.\n\n1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:51.400\n Exactly.\n\n1:47:51.400 --> 1:47:53.000\n And that hasn't happened before.\n\n1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.320\n Yeah, never.\n\n1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:58.120\n And this somehow, this mutation is really useful.\n\n1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:02.000\n It's really useful in the current environment of the genome,\n\n1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.920\n which is moving from human to human.\n\n1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:06.840\n When it was moving from bat to bat,\n\n1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:08.680\n it couldn't care less for that mutation,\n\n1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:09.960\n but it's environment specific.\n\n1:48:09.960 --> 1:48:12.560\n So now that it's moving from human to human,\n\n1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:15.920\n it's moving way better, like by orders of magnitude.\n\n1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:18.440\n What do you, okay, so you're like tracking\n\n1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:22.520\n this evolutionary dynamics, which is fascinating,\n\n1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:24.200\n but what do you do with that?\n\n1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:25.320\n So what does that mean?\n\n1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:27.560\n What does this mean, what do you make,\n\n1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:29.120\n what do you make of this mutation\n\n1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:31.560\n in trying to anticipate, I guess,\n\n1:48:31.560 --> 1:48:34.120\n is one of the things you're trying to do\n\n1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:37.840\n is anticipate where, how this unrolls into the future,\n\n1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:39.760\n this evolutionary dynamics.\n\n1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:40.640\n Such a great question.\n\n1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:42.880\n So there's two things.\n\n1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:44.680\n Remember when I was saying earlier,\n\n1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:47.040\n mutation is the path to new things,\n\n1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:49.720\n but also the path to break old things.\n\n1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:52.960\n So what we know is that this position\n\n1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:56.600\n was extremely preserved through gazillions of mutations.\n\n1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:58.440\n That mutation was never tolerated\n\n1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:00.200\n when it was moving from bats to bats.\n\n1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:02.480\n So that basically means that that position\n\n1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:05.600\n is extremely important in the function of that protein.\n\n1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:06.920\n That's the first thing it tells.\n\n1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:09.280\n The second one is that that position\n\n1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:12.360\n was very well suited to bat transmission,\n\n1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:14.720\n but now is not well suited to human transmission,\n\n1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:15.840\n so it got rid of it.\n\n1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:18.840\n And it now has a new version of that amino acid\n\n1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:20.920\n that basically makes it much easier\n\n1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:22.720\n to transmit from human to human.\n\n1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:27.440\n So in terms of the evolutionary history\n\n1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:29.800\n teaching us about the future,\n\n1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:31.960\n it basically tells us here's the regions\n\n1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:34.760\n that are currently mutating.\n\n1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:36.400\n Here's the regions that are most likely\n\n1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:37.880\n to mutate going forward.\n\n1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:39.440\n As you're building a vaccine,\n\n1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:41.680\n here's what you should be focusing on\n\n1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:43.520\n in terms of the most stable regions\n\n1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:45.440\n that are the least likely to mutate.\n\n1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:48.200\n Or here's the newly evolved functions\n\n1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:50.240\n that are the most likely to be important\n\n1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:54.560\n because they've overcome this local maximum\n\n1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.360\n that it had reached in the bat transmission.\n\n1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:01.760\n So anyway, it's a tangent to basically say\n\n1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:04.080\n that evolution works in messy ways.\n\n1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:06.320\n And the thing that you would break\n\n1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:10.320\n is the thing that actually allows you\n\n1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:12.160\n to first go through a lull\n\n1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:15.200\n and then reaching new local maximum.\n\n1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:18.920\n And I often like to say that if engineers\n\n1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:21.200\n had basically designed evolution,\n\n1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:24.520\n we would still be perfectly replicating bacteria\n\n1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:29.400\n because it's my making the bacterium worse\n\n1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.200\n that you allow evolution to reach a new optimum.\n\n1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:34.520\n That's, just to pause on that,\n\n1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:35.840\n that's so profound.\n\n1:50:35.840 --> 1:50:39.400\n That's so profound for the entirety\n\n1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:43.720\n of this scientific and engineering disciplines.\n\n1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:45.520\n Exactly.\n\n1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:48.520\n We as engineers need to embrace breaking things.\n\n1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.960\n We as engineers need to embrace robustness\n\n1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:54.240\n as the first principle beyond perfection\n\n1:50:54.240 --> 1:50:56.040\n because nothing's gonna ever be perfect.\n\n1:50:56.040 --> 1:50:58.440\n And when you're sending a satellite to Mars,\n\n1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:01.160\n when something goes wrong, it'll break down.\n\n1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:04.600\n As opposed to building systems that tolerate failure\n\n1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:08.840\n and are resilient to that.\n\n1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:11.080\n And in fact, get better through that.\n\n1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:14.400\n So the SpaceX approach versus NASA for the...\n\n1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:16.200\n For example.\n\n1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:21.320\n Is there something we can learn about the incredible,\n\n1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:23.960\n take lessons from the incredible biological systems\n\n1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:27.600\n in their resilience, in the mushiness, the messiness\n\n1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:31.880\n to our computing systems, to our computers?\n\n1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:35.280\n It would basically be starting from scratch in many ways.\n\n1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:38.960\n It would basically be building new paradigms\n\n1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:42.760\n that don't try to get the right answer all the time,\n\n1:51:42.760 --> 1:51:45.600\n but try to get the right answer most of the time\n\n1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:47.000\n or a lot of the time.\n\n1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.280\n Do you see deep learning systems in the whole world\n\n1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:51.120\n of machine learning as kind of taking a step\n\n1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:52.000\n in that direction?\n\n1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.600\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:57.560\n Basically by allowing this much more natural evolution\n\n1:51:57.560 --> 1:52:01.080\n of these parameters, you basically...\n\n1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:04.000\n And if you look at sort of deep learning systems again,\n\n1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:07.440\n they're not inspired by the genome aspect of biology,\n\n1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:10.160\n they're inspired by the brain aspect of biology.\n\n1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:12.560\n And again, I want you to pause for a second\n\n1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:17.560\n and realize the complexity of the entire human brain\n\n1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:22.760\n with trillions of connections within our neurons,\n\n1:52:22.760 --> 1:52:26.640\n with millions of cells talking to each other,\n\n1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:29.040\n is still encoded within that same genome.\n\n1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:34.040\n That same genome encodes every single freaking cell type\n\n1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:37.920\n of the entire body.\n\n1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:41.040\n Every single cell is encoded by the same code.\n\n1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:45.240\n And yet specialization allows you to have\n\n1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:50.040\n the single viral like genome that self replicates,\n\n1:52:50.040 --> 1:52:54.200\n the single module, modular automaton,\n\n1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:57.360\n work with other copies of itself, it's mind boggling.\n\n1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:01.600\n Create complex organs through which blood flows.\n\n1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:02.680\n And what is that blood?\n\n1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:04.120\n The same freaking genome.\n\n1:53:05.560 --> 1:53:09.840\n Create organs that communicate with each other.\n\n1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:11.080\n And what are these organs?\n\n1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:13.120\n The exact same genome.\n\n1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:17.560\n Create a brain that is innervated by massive amounts\n\n1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:21.240\n of blood pumping energy to it,\n\n1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:28.240\n 20% of our energetic needs to the brain from the same genome.\n\n1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:30.120\n And all of the neuronal connections,\n\n1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:33.920\n all of the auxiliary cells, all of the immune cells,\n\n1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:35.920\n the astrocytes, the ligodendrocytes, the neurons,\n\n1:53:35.920 --> 1:53:37.360\n the excitatory, the inhibitory neurons,\n\n1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:39.480\n all of the different classes of parasites,\n\n1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:42.880\n the blood brain barrier, all of that, same genome.\n\n1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:47.680\n One way to see that in a sad, this one is beautiful.\n\n1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:50.800\n The sad thing is thinking about the trillions\n\n1:53:50.800 --> 1:53:55.240\n of organisms that died to create that.\n\n1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:57.080\n You mean on the evolutionary path to humans?\n\n1:53:57.080 --> 1:53:59.600\n On the evolutionary path to humans.\n\n1:53:59.600 --> 1:54:02.680\n It's crazy, there's two descendant of apes\n\n1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:04.760\n just talking on a podcast.\n\n1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:08.520\n Okay, it's just so mind boggling.\n\n1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:11.120\n Just to boggle our minds a little bit more.\n\n1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:12.520\n Us talking to each other,\n\n1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:18.440\n we are basically generating a series of vocal utterances\n\n1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:23.440\n through our pulsating of vocal cords received through this.\n\n1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:26.160\n The people who listen to this\n\n1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:29.240\n are taking a completely different path\n\n1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.880\n to that information transfer, yet through language.\n\n1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:36.160\n But imagine if we could connect these brains\n\n1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:37.520\n directly to each other.\n\n1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:41.600\n The amount of information that I'm condensing\n\n1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:46.360\n into a small number of words is a huge funnel,\n\n1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:49.480\n which then you receive and you expand\n\n1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:52.840\n into a huge number of thoughts from that small funnel.\n\n1:54:55.760 --> 1:54:58.080\n In many ways, engineers would love\n\n1:54:58.080 --> 1:54:59.880\n to have the whole information transfer,\n\n1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:02.640\n just take the whole set of neurons and throw them away.\n\n1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:05.440\n I mean, throw them to the other person.\n\n1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:07.280\n This might actually not be better\n\n1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:10.640\n because in your misinterpretation\n\n1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:13.000\n of every word that I'm saying,\n\n1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.680\n you are creating new interpretation\n\n1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:16.080\n that might actually be way better\n\n1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:17.920\n than what I meant in the first place.\n\n1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:21.760\n The ambiguity of language perhaps\n\n1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:25.000\n might be the secret to creativity.\n\n1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.400\n Every single time you work on a project by yourself,\n\n1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:31.120\n you only bounce ideas with one person\n\n1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:33.760\n and your neurons are basically fully cognizant\n\n1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:35.880\n of what these ideas are.\n\n1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:37.720\n But the moment you interact with another person,\n\n1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:41.080\n the misinterpretations that happen\n\n1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:43.760\n might be the most creative part of the process.\n\n1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:45.600\n With my students, every time we have a research meeting,\n\n1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:47.560\n I very often pause and say,\n\n1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:50.400\n let me repeat what you just said in a different way.\n\n1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:52.400\n And I sort of go on and brainstorm\n\n1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:53.680\n with what they were saying,\n\n1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:55.960\n but by the third time,\n\n1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:58.000\n it's not what they were saying at all.\n\n1:55:58.000 --> 1:55:59.480\n And when they pick up what I'm saying,\n\n1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:01.160\n they're like, oh, well, dah, dah, dah.\n\n1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:04.160\n Now they've sort of learned something very different\n\n1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:05.000\n from what I was saying.\n\n1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:08.480\n And that is the same kind of messiness\n\n1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:10.960\n that I'm describing in the genome itself.\n\n1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:13.600\n It's sort of embracing the messiness.\n\n1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:15.400\n And that's a feature, not a book.\n\n1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:16.240\n Exactly.\n\n1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:17.560\n And in the same way, when you're thinking\n\n1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:19.960\n about sort of these deep learning systems\n\n1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:23.600\n that will allow us to sort of be more creative perhaps\n\n1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:27.560\n or learn better approximations of these complex functions,\n\n1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:29.800\n again, tuned to the universe that we inhabit,\n\n1:56:30.720 --> 1:56:33.680\n you have to embrace the breaking.\n\n1:56:33.680 --> 1:56:35.400\n You have to embrace the,\n\n1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:38.000\n how do we get out of these local optima?\n\n1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.960\n And a lot of the design paradigms\n\n1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:43.400\n that have made deep learning so successful\n\n1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:45.400\n are ways to get away from that,\n\n1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:47.360\n ways to get better training\n\n1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:50.520\n by sort of sending long range messages,\n\n1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:55.520\n these LSTM models and the sort of feed forward loops\n\n1:56:55.920 --> 1:56:59.280\n that sort of jump through layers\n\n1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:00.920\n of a convolutional neural network.\n\n1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:04.960\n All of these things are basically ways to push you out\n\n1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:06.400\n of these local maxima.\n\n1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:08.840\n And that's sort of what evolution does.\n\n1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:09.840\n That's what language does.\n\n1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:12.360\n That's what conversation and brainstorming does.\n\n1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:14.120\n That's what our brain does.\n\n1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:18.320\n So this design paradigm is something that's pervasive\n\n1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:20.560\n and yet not taught in schools,\n\n1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:22.280\n not taught in engineering schools\n\n1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:24.520\n where everything's minutely modularized\n\n1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:26.040\n to make sure that we never deviate\n\n1:57:26.040 --> 1:57:28.640\n from whatever signal we're trying to emit\n\n1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:31.440\n as opposed to let all hell breaks loose\n\n1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:34.000\n because that's the path to paradise.\n\n1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:35.440\n The path to paradise.\n\n1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:38.040\n Yeah, I mean, it's difficult to know how to teach that\n\n1:57:38.040 --> 1:57:39.320\n and what to do with it.\n\n1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:43.680\n I mean, it's difficult to know how to build up\n\n1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:46.640\n the scientific method around messiness.\n\n1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:49.960\n I mean, it's not all messiness.\n\n1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:51.960\n We need some cleanness.\n\n1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:54.400\n And going back to the example with Mars,\n\n1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:55.520\n that's probably the place where I want\n\n1:57:55.520 --> 1:57:58.800\n to sort of moderate error as much as possible\n\n1:57:58.800 --> 1:58:01.080\n and sort of control the environment as much as possible.\n\n1:58:01.080 --> 1:58:03.160\n But if you're trying to repopulate Mars,\n\n1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:05.320\n well, maybe messiness is a good thing then.\n\n1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:09.280\n On that, you quickly mentioned this\n\n1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:12.920\n in terms of us using our vocal cords\n\n1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:15.120\n to speak on a podcast.\n\n1:58:15.120 --> 1:58:17.800\n So Elon Musk and Neuralink are working\n\n1:58:17.800 --> 1:58:22.680\n on trying to plug, as per our discussion\n\n1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:24.920\n with computers and biological systems,\n\n1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:25.840\n to connect the two.\n\n1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:30.640\n He's trying to connect our brain to a computer\n\n1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:32.840\n to create a brain computer interface\n\n1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:36.160\n where they can communicate back and forth.\n\n1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:40.960\n On this line of thinking, do you think this is possible\n\n1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:45.200\n to bridge the gap between our engineered computing systems\n\n1:58:45.200 --> 1:58:48.240\n and the messy biological systems?\n\n1:58:49.280 --> 1:58:51.920\n My answer would be absolutely.\n\n1:58:51.920 --> 1:58:54.440\n You know, there's no doubt that we can understand\n\n1:58:54.440 --> 1:58:57.120\n more and more about what goes on in the brain\n\n1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:00.520\n and we can sort of train the brain.\n\n1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:03.600\n I don't know if you remember the Palm Pilot.\n\n1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:04.720\n Yeah, Palm Pilot, yeah.\n\n1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:08.440\n Remember this whole sort of alphabet that they had created?\n\n1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:10.920\n Am I thinking of the same thing?\n\n1:59:10.920 --> 1:59:13.280\n It's basically, you had a little pen\n\n1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:17.000\n and for every character, you had a little scribble\n\n1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:19.800\n that was unique that the machine could understand.\n\n1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:22.520\n And that instead of trying the machine\n\n1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:23.640\n and trying to teach the machine\n\n1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:25.200\n to recognize human characters,\n\n1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:27.200\n you had basically, they figured out\n\n1:59:27.200 --> 1:59:29.960\n that it's better and easier to train humans\n\n1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:31.840\n to create human like characters\n\n1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:34.760\n that the machine is better at recognizing.\n\n1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:38.320\n So in the same way, I think what will happen\n\n1:59:38.320 --> 1:59:40.600\n is that humans will be trained\n\n1:59:40.600 --> 1:59:43.200\n to be able to create the mind pattern\n\n1:59:43.200 --> 1:59:45.160\n that the machine will respond to\n\n1:59:45.160 --> 1:59:47.760\n before the machine truly comprehends our thoughts.\n\n1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:50.160\n So the first human brain interfaces\n\n1:59:50.160 --> 1:59:53.640\n will be tricking humans to speak the machine language\n\n1:59:53.640 --> 1:59:55.640\n where with the right set of electrodes,\n\n1:59:55.640 --> 1:59:57.640\n I can sort of trick my brain into doing this.\n\n1:59:57.640 --> 2:00:00.240\n And this is the same way that many people teach,\n\n2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:02.960\n like learn to control artificial limbs.\n\n2:00:02.960 --> 2:00:04.520\n You basically try a bunch of stuff\n\n2:00:04.520 --> 2:00:06.880\n and eventually you figure out how your limbs work.\n\n2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:08.200\n That might not be very different\n\n2:00:08.200 --> 2:00:11.480\n from how humans learn to use their natural limbs\n\n2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:13.080\n when they first grow up.\n\n2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:14.920\n Basically, you have these, you know,\n\n2:00:14.920 --> 2:00:17.960\n neoteny period of, you know,\n\n2:00:17.960 --> 2:00:21.320\n this puddle of soup inside your brain,\n\n2:00:21.320 --> 2:00:23.840\n trying to figure out how to even make neural connections\n\n2:00:23.840 --> 2:00:27.280\n before you're born and then learning sounds\n\n2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:31.480\n in utero of, you know, all kinds of echoes\n\n2:00:31.480 --> 2:00:35.840\n and, you know, eventually getting out in the real world.\n\n2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:37.280\n And I don't know if you've seen newborns,\n\n2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:39.840\n but they just stare around a lot.\n\n2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:41.680\n You know, one way to think about this\n\n2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:43.000\n as a machine learning person is,\n\n2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:46.080\n oh, they're just training their edge detectors.\n\n2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:47.320\n And eventually they figure out\n\n2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:48.680\n how to train their edge detectors.\n\n2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:50.800\n They work through the second layer of the visual cortex\n\n2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:52.640\n and the third layer and so on and so forth.\n\n2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:57.640\n And you basically have this learning\n\n2:00:58.320 --> 2:00:59.360\n how to control your limbs\n\n2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:01.000\n that probably comes at the same time.\n\n2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.280\n You're sort of, you know, throwing random things there\n\n2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:04.720\n and you realize that, oh, wow,\n\n2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:07.120\n when I do this thing, my limb moves.\n\n2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:09.240\n Let's do the following experiment.\n\n2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:10.080\n Take a breath.\n\n2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:13.480\n What muscles did you flex?\n\n2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:16.600\n Now take another breath and think what muscles do I flex?\n\n2:01:16.600 --> 2:01:17.920\n The first thing that you're thinking\n\n2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:19.840\n when you're taking a breath\n\n2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:22.320\n is the impact that it has on your lungs.\n\n2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:24.080\n You're like, oh, I'm now gonna increase my lungs\n\n2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:25.440\n or I'm not gonna bring air in.\n\n2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:26.360\n But what you're actually doing\n\n2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:27.960\n is just changing your diaphragm.\n\n2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:31.880\n That's not conscious, of course.\n\n2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:34.920\n You never think of the diaphragm as a thing.\n\n2:01:34.920 --> 2:01:36.000\n And why is that?\n\n2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:37.360\n That's probably the same reason\n\n2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:38.800\n why I think of moving my finger\n\n2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:40.520\n when I actually move my finger.\n\n2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:42.520\n I think of the effect instead of actually thinking\n\n2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:44.080\n of whatever muscle is twitching\n\n2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:46.440\n that actually causes my finger to move.\n\n2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:49.240\n So we basically in our first years of life\n\n2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:52.360\n build up this massive lookup table\n\n2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:55.400\n between whatever neuronal firing we do\n\n2:01:55.400 --> 2:02:00.400\n and whatever action happens in our body that we control.\n\n2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:03.160\n If you have a kid grow up with a third limb,\n\n2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:06.600\n I'm sure they'll figure out how to control them\n\n2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:09.440\n probably at the same rate as their natural limbs.\n\n2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:13.320\n And a lot of the work would be done by the...\n\n2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:15.520\n If a third limb is a computer,\n\n2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:20.440\n you kind of have a, not a faith, but a thought\n\n2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:24.360\n that the brain might be able to figure out...\n\n2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:26.840\n The plasticity would come from the brain.\n\n2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:28.960\n The brain would be cleverer than the machine at first.\n\n2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:29.960\n When I talk about a third limb,\n\n2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:32.240\n that's exactly what I'm saying, an artificial limb\n\n2:02:32.240 --> 2:02:35.640\n that basically just controls your mouse while you're typing.\n\n2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:36.600\n Perfectly natural thing.\n\n2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:39.000\n I mean, again, in a few hundred years.\n\n2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:41.600\n Maybe sooner than that.\n\n2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:46.040\n But basically, as long as the machine is consistent\n\n2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:49.760\n in the way that it will respond to your brain impulses,\n\n2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.680\n you'll figure out how to control that\n\n2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:53.920\n and you could play tennis with your third limb.\n\n2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:57.480\n And let me go back to consistency.\n\n2:02:57.480 --> 2:03:01.280\n People who have dramatic accidents\n\n2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:03.920\n that basically take out a whole chunk of their brain\n\n2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:07.000\n can be taught to coopt other parts of the brain\n\n2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:08.560\n to then control that part.\n\n2:03:08.560 --> 2:03:10.840\n You can basically build up that tissue again\n\n2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:13.480\n and eventually train your body how to walk again\n\n2:03:13.480 --> 2:03:15.400\n and how to read again and how to play again\n\n2:03:15.400 --> 2:03:17.160\n and how to think again, how to speak a language again,\n\n2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:18.080\n et cetera.\n\n2:03:18.080 --> 2:03:21.280\n So there's a massive amount of malleability\n\n2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:26.280\n that happens naturally in our way of controlling our body,\n\n2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:29.720\n our brain, our thoughts, our vocal cords, our limbs,\n\n2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:30.760\n et cetera.\n\n2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:35.640\n And human machine interfaces are inevitable\n\n2:03:35.640 --> 2:03:39.240\n if we sort of figure out how to read these electric impulses,\n\n2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:43.400\n but the resolution at which we can understand human thought\n\n2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:46.560\n right now is nil, is ridiculous.\n\n2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:49.120\n So how are human thoughts encoded?\n\n2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:53.560\n It's basically combinations of neurons that cofire\n\n2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:55.720\n and these create these things called engrams\n\n2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:58.920\n that eventually form memories and so on and so forth.\n\n2:03:58.920 --> 2:04:01.920\n We know nothing of all that stuff.\n\n2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:05.600\n So before we can actually read into your brain\n\n2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:06.680\n that you wanna build a program\n\n2:04:06.680 --> 2:04:08.920\n that does this and this and this and that,\n\n2:04:08.920 --> 2:04:10.960\n we need a lot of neuroscience.\n\n2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:13.480\n Well, so to push back on that,\n\n2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:16.680\n do you think it's possible that without understanding\n\n2:04:16.680 --> 2:04:20.000\n the functionally about the brain or from the neuroscience\n\n2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.080\n or the cognitive science or psychology,\n\n2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:24.220\n whichever level of the brain we'll look at,\n\n2:04:24.220 --> 2:04:26.700\n do you think if we just connect them,\n\n2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:29.200\n just like per your previous point,\n\n2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:30.840\n if we just have a high enough resolution\n\n2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:34.400\n between connection between a Wikipedia and your brain,\n\n2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:38.160\n the brain will just figure it out with us understanding\n\n2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:40.320\n because that's one of the innovations of Neuralink\n\n2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:43.540\n is they're increasing the number of connections\n\n2:04:43.540 --> 2:04:45.320\n to the brain to like several thousand,\n\n2:04:45.320 --> 2:04:48.280\n which before was in the dozens or whatever.\n\n2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:51.000\n You're still off by a few orders of magnitude\n\n2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:52.160\n on the order of seven.\n\n2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:57.160\n Right, but the thing is, the hope is if you increase\n\n2:04:57.480 --> 2:04:58.800\n that number more and more and more,\n\n2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:00.600\n maybe you don't need to understand anything\n\n2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:03.780\n about the actual how human thought\n\n2:05:03.780 --> 2:05:04.960\n is represented in the brain.\n\n2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:08.520\n You can just let it figure it out by itself.\n\n2:05:08.520 --> 2:05:10.680\n Keanu Reeves waking up and saying, I know cook food.\n\n2:05:10.680 --> 2:05:11.520\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:05:13.160 --> 2:05:14.600\n So yeah, sure.\n\n2:05:14.600 --> 2:05:16.720\n You don't have faith in the plasticity of the brain\n\n2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:18.240\n to that degree.\n\n2:05:18.240 --> 2:05:19.840\n It's not about brain plasticity.\n\n2:05:19.840 --> 2:05:21.880\n It's about the input aspect.\n\n2:05:21.880 --> 2:05:23.720\n Basically, I think on the output aspect,\n\n2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:25.440\n being able to control a machine is something\n\n2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:28.440\n that you can probably train your neural impulses\n\n2:05:28.440 --> 2:05:30.940\n that you're sending out to sort of match\n\n2:05:30.940 --> 2:05:33.280\n whatever response you see in the environment.\n\n2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:35.600\n If this thing moved every single time I thought\n\n2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:37.340\n a particular thought, then I could figure out,\n\n2:05:37.340 --> 2:05:39.520\n I could hack my way into moving this thing\n\n2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:40.960\n with just a series of thoughts.\n\n2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:44.640\n I could think guitar, piano, tennis ball,\n\n2:05:45.880 --> 2:05:47.120\n and then this thing would be moving.\n\n2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:50.640\n And then I would just have the series of thoughts\n\n2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:52.640\n that would sort of result in the impulses\n\n2:05:52.640 --> 2:05:54.040\n that will move this thing the way that I want it.\n\n2:05:54.040 --> 2:05:55.560\n And then eventually it'll become natural\n\n2:05:55.560 --> 2:05:57.640\n because I won't even think about it.\n\n2:05:57.640 --> 2:05:59.120\n I mean, in the same way that we control our limbs\n\n2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:01.360\n in a very natural way, but babies don't do that.\n\n2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:03.160\n Babies have to figure it out.\n\n2:06:03.160 --> 2:06:04.840\n And some of that is hard coded,\n\n2:06:04.840 --> 2:06:06.800\n but some of that is actually learned\n\n2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:10.320\n based on whatever soup of neurons you ended up with,\n\n2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:13.440\n whatever connections you pruned them to,\n\n2:06:13.440 --> 2:06:15.360\n and eventually you were born with.\n\n2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:17.740\n A lot of that is coded in the genome,\n\n2:06:17.740 --> 2:06:19.680\n but a huge chunk of that is stochastic.\n\n2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:21.320\n And sort of the way that you sort of create\n\n2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:23.440\n all these neurons, they migrate, they form connections,\n\n2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:25.140\n they sort of spread out,\n\n2:06:25.140 --> 2:06:26.520\n they have particular branching patterns,\n\n2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:28.200\n but then the connectivity itself,\n\n2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:30.120\n unique in every single new person.\n\n2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:34.000\n All this to say that on the output side,\n\n2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.920\n absolutely, I'm very, very, you know,\n\n2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:38.640\n hopeful that we can have machines\n\n2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:41.920\n that read thousands of these neuronal connections\n\n2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:45.580\n on the output side, but on the input side, oh boy.\n\n2:06:47.960 --> 2:06:51.240\n I don't expect any time in the near future\n\n2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:53.400\n we'll be able to sort of send a series of impulses\n\n2:06:53.400 --> 2:06:56.280\n that will tell me, oh, earth to sun distance,\n\n2:06:56.280 --> 2:06:58.960\n 7.5 million, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:00.720\n Like nowhere.\n\n2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:04.480\n I mean, I think language will still be the input way\n\n2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:07.360\n rather than sort of any kind of more complex.\n\n2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:08.760\n It's a really interesting notion\n\n2:07:08.760 --> 2:07:12.600\n that the ambiguity of language is a feature.\n\n2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:16.520\n And we evolved for millions of years\n\n2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:19.520\n to take advantage of that ambiguity.\n\n2:07:19.520 --> 2:07:20.520\n Exactly.\n\n2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:23.380\n And yet no one teaches us the subtle differences\n\n2:07:23.380 --> 2:07:26.080\n between words that are near cognates,\n\n2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:29.320\n and yet evoke so much more than, you know,\n\n2:07:29.320 --> 2:07:30.760\n one from the other.\n\n2:07:30.760 --> 2:07:34.520\n And yet, you know, when you're choosing words\n\n2:07:34.520 --> 2:07:36.840\n from a list of 20 synonyms,\n\n2:07:36.840 --> 2:07:38.400\n you know exactly the connotation\n\n2:07:38.400 --> 2:07:40.040\n of every single one of them.\n\n2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:42.600\n And that's something that, you know, is there.\n\n2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:45.120\n So yes, there's ambiguity,\n\n2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:46.800\n but there's all kinds of connotations.\n\n2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:48.880\n And in the way that we select our words,\n\n2:07:48.880 --> 2:07:51.320\n we have so much baggage that we're sending along,\n\n2:07:51.320 --> 2:07:52.960\n the way that we're emoting,\n\n2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:54.720\n the way that we're moving our hands\n\n2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:56.080\n every single time we speak,\n\n2:07:56.080 --> 2:07:58.880\n the, you know, the pauses, the eye contact, et cetera.\n\n2:07:58.880 --> 2:08:01.800\n So much higher baud rate than just a vocal,\n\n2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:04.040\n you know, string of characters.\n\n2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:07.120\n Well, let me just take a small tangent on that.\n\n2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:07.960\n Oh, tangent?\n\n2:08:07.960 --> 2:08:08.800\n We haven't done that yet.\n\n2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:09.640\n It's a good idea.\n\n2:08:09.640 --> 2:08:10.480\n Let's do a tangent.\n\n2:08:10.480 --> 2:08:14.080\n We'll return to the origin of life after.\n\n2:08:16.200 --> 2:08:17.840\n So, I mean, you're Greek,\n\n2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:20.880\n but I'm going on this personal journey.\n\n2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:25.120\n I'm going to Paris for the explicit purpose\n\n2:08:25.120 --> 2:08:29.360\n of talking to one of the most famous,\n\n2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:33.200\n a couple who's a famous translators of Russian literature,\n\n2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:36.280\n Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and they go,\n\n2:08:36.280 --> 2:08:38.440\n that's their art is the translation.\n\n2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:43.440\n And everything I've learned about the translation art,\n\n2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:46.120\n it makes me feel,\n\n2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:51.120\n it's so profound in a way that's so much more profound\n\n2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:55.400\n than the natural language processing papers\n\n2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:57.440\n I read in the machine learning community,\n\n2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:00.440\n that there's such depth to language\n\n2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:03.160\n that I don't know what to do with.\n\n2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:05.720\n I don't know if you've experienced that in your own life\n\n2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:08.760\n with knowing multiple languages.\n\n2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:09.840\n I don't know what to,\n\n2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:11.680\n I don't know how to make sense of it,\n\n2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:13.600\n but there's so much loss in translation\n\n2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:15.320\n between Russian and English,\n\n2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:17.440\n and getting a sense of that.\n\n2:09:17.440 --> 2:09:18.480\n Like, for example,\n\n2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:22.000\n there's like just taking a single sentence\n\n2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:25.440\n from Dostoevsky, and like, there's a lot of them.\n\n2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:27.160\n You could talk for hours\n\n2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:30.120\n about how to translate that sentence properly.\n\n2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:34.360\n That captures the meaning, the period,\n\n2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.560\n the culture, the humor, the wit,\n\n2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:39.760\n the suffering that was in the context of the time,\n\n2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:42.280\n all of that could be a single sentence.\n\n2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:46.120\n You could talk forever about what it takes\n\n2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:47.160\n to translate that correctly.\n\n2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:48.720\n I don't know what to do with that.\n\n2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:51.640\n So being Greek, it's very hard for me\n\n2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:54.480\n to think of a sentence or even a word\n\n2:09:54.480 --> 2:09:59.000\n without going into the full etymology of that word,\n\n2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:04.000\n breaking up every single atom of that sentence\n\n2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:07.080\n and every single atom of these words\n\n2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:08.840\n and rebuilding it back up.\n\n2:10:09.800 --> 2:10:11.200\n I have three kids.\n\n2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:13.680\n And the way that I teach them Greek\n\n2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:16.240\n is the same way that, you know,\n\n2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:17.640\n the documentary I was mentioning earlier\n\n2:10:17.640 --> 2:10:19.720\n about sort of understanding the deep roots\n\n2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:21.920\n of all of these, you know, words.\n\n2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:28.880\n And it's very interesting\n\n2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:31.320\n that every single time I hear a new word\n\n2:10:31.320 --> 2:10:33.000\n that I've never heard before,\n\n2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:34.720\n I go and figure out the etymology of that word\n\n2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:36.760\n because I will never appreciate that word\n\n2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:40.160\n without understanding how it was initially formed.\n\n2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:42.080\n Interesting, but how does that help?\n\n2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:44.080\n Because that's not the full picture.\n\n2:10:44.080 --> 2:10:44.920\n No, no, of course, of course.\n\n2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:48.360\n But what I'm trying to say is that knowing the components\n\n2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:52.280\n teaches you about the context of the formation of that word\n\n2:10:52.280 --> 2:10:54.880\n and sort of the original usage of that word.\n\n2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:57.360\n And then of course the word takes new meaning\n\n2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:00.840\n as you create it, you know, from its parts.\n\n2:11:00.840 --> 2:11:04.120\n And that meaning then gets augmented.\n\n2:11:04.120 --> 2:11:08.160\n And two synonyms that sort of have different roots\n\n2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:09.200\n will actually have implications\n\n2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:11.440\n that carry a lot of that baggage\n\n2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:14.240\n of the historical provenance of these words.\n\n2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:16.640\n So before working on genome evolution,\n\n2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:19.920\n my passion was evolution of language\n\n2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:23.760\n and sort of tracing cognates across different languages\n\n2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:27.280\n through their etymologies.\n\n2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:30.320\n That's fascinating that there's parallels between,\n\n2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:34.280\n I mean, the idea that there's evolutionary dynamics\n\n2:11:34.280 --> 2:11:35.520\n to our language.\n\n2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:40.520\n Yeah, every single word that you utter, parallels, parallels.\n\n2:11:41.560 --> 2:11:42.680\n What does parallels mean?\n\n2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:44.800\n Para means side by side.\n\n2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:48.760\n Alleles from alleles, which means identical twins.\n\n2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:49.600\n Parallels.\n\n2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:53.200\n I mean, name any word and there's so much baggage,\n\n2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:56.880\n so much beauty in how that word came to be\n\n2:11:56.880 --> 2:11:58.920\n and how this word took a new meaning\n\n2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:00.320\n than the sum of its parts.\n\n2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:05.440\n Yeah, and there's just, there's so many different words\n\n2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:06.280\n that are just words.\n\n2:12:06.280 --> 2:12:08.800\n They don't have any physical grounding.\n\n2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:10.240\n And now you take these words\n\n2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:12.640\n and you weave them into a sentence.\n\n2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:18.600\n The emotional invocations of that weaving are fathomless.\n\n2:12:19.280 --> 2:12:24.280\n And all of those emotions all live in the brains of humans.\n\n2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:27.040\n In the eye of the beholder.\n\n2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:30.840\n No, seriously, you have to embrace this concept\n\n2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:32.440\n of the eye of the beholder.\n\n2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:37.440\n It's the conceptualization that nothing takes meaning\n\n2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:39.400\n with one person creating it.\n\n2:12:39.400 --> 2:12:42.480\n Everything takes meaning in the receiving end\n\n2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:47.480\n and the emergent properties of these communication networks\n\n2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:49.320\n where every single, you know,\n\n2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:50.960\n if you look at the network of our cells\n\n2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:52.480\n and how they're communicating with each other,\n\n2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:54.200\n every cell has its own code.\n\n2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:56.200\n This code is modulated by the epigenome.\n\n2:12:56.200 --> 2:12:57.960\n This creates a bunch of different cell types.\n\n2:12:57.960 --> 2:12:59.960\n Each cell type now has its own identity.\n\n2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:02.200\n Yet they all have the common root of the stem cells\n\n2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:03.680\n that sort of led to them.\n\n2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:06.600\n Each of these identities is now communicating\n\n2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:08.120\n with each other.\n\n2:13:08.120 --> 2:13:11.800\n They take meaning in their interaction.\n\n2:13:11.800 --> 2:13:13.760\n There's an emergent property that comes\n\n2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:15.680\n from a bunch of cells being together\n\n2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:17.920\n that is not in any one of the parts.\n\n2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:19.320\n If you look at neurons communicating,\n\n2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:23.360\n again, these engrams don't exist in any one neuron.\n\n2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:26.480\n They exist in the connection and the combination of neurons.\n\n2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:29.040\n And the meaning of the words that I'm telling you\n\n2:13:29.040 --> 2:13:31.880\n is empty until it reaches you\n\n2:13:31.880 --> 2:13:34.120\n and it affects you in a very different way\n\n2:13:34.120 --> 2:13:35.440\n than it affects whoever's listening\n\n2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:37.520\n to this conversation now.\n\n2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:40.400\n Because of the emotional baggage that I've grown up with,\n\n2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:43.280\n that you've grown up with, and that they've grown up with.\n\n2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:46.800\n And that's, I think, the magic of translation.\n\n2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:48.720\n If you start thinking of translation\n\n2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:53.720\n as just simply capturing that emotional set of reactions\n\n2:13:53.720 --> 2:13:57.880\n that you evoke, you need a different set of words\n\n2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:01.240\n to evoke that same set of reactions to a French person\n\n2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:02.760\n than to a Russian person,\n\n2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:05.480\n because of the baggage of the culture that we grew up in.\n\n2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:07.320\n Yeah, I mean, there's...\n\n2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:10.440\n So basically, you shouldn't find the best word.\n\n2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:13.120\n Sometimes it's a completely different sentence structure\n\n2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:14.120\n that you will need,\n\n2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:18.960\n matched to the cultural context\n\n2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:20.560\n of the target audience that you have.\n\n2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:22.360\n Yeah, there's a lot of different words\n\n2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:23.800\n in the target audience that you have.\n\n2:14:23.800 --> 2:14:26.480\n Yeah, it's, I mean, you're just...\n\n2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:27.720\n I usually don't think about this,\n\n2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:30.000\n but right now, there's this feeling,\n\n2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.680\n as a reminder, that it's just you and I talking,\n\n2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:35.280\n but there's several hundred thousand people\n\n2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:36.440\n will listen to this.\n\n2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:39.520\n There's some guy in Russia right now running,\n\n2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:44.120\n like in Moscow, listening to us.\n\n2:14:44.120 --> 2:14:46.680\n There's somebody in India, I guarantee you.\n\n2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:48.680\n There's somebody in China and South America.\n\n2:14:48.680 --> 2:14:51.240\n There's somebody in Texas,\n\n2:14:51.240 --> 2:14:53.120\n they all have different...\n\n2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:54.120\n Emotional baggage.\n\n2:14:54.120 --> 2:14:56.160\n They probably got angry earlier on\n\n2:14:56.160 --> 2:14:58.360\n about the whole discussion about coronavirus\n\n2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:02.080\n and about some aspect of it.\n\n2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:06.960\n Yeah, and there's that network effect that's...\n\n2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:08.000\n It's a beautiful thing.\n\n2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.880\n And this lateral transfer of information,\n\n2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:12.920\n that's what makes the collective, quote unquote,\n\n2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:17.920\n genome of humanity so unique from any other species.\n\n2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:19.920\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:22.640\n So you somehow miraculously wrapped it back\n\n2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:25.160\n to the very beginning of when we were talking\n\n2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:27.840\n about the beauty of the human genome.\n\n2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:31.240\n So I think this is the right time,\n\n2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:34.880\n unless we wanna go for a six to eight hour conversation.\n\n2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:36.000\n We're gonna have to talk again,\n\n2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:39.120\n but I think for now, to wrap it up,\n\n2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:41.080\n this is the right time to talk about\n\n2:15:41.080 --> 2:15:44.960\n the biggest, most ridiculous question of all,\n\n2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:45.900\n meaning of life.\n\n2:15:45.900 --> 2:15:47.340\n Off mic, you mentioned to me\n\n2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:52.340\n that you had your 42nd birthday.\n\n2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:57.480\n 42nd being a very special, absurdly special number.\n\n2:15:58.480 --> 2:16:03.040\n And you had a kind of get together with friends\n\n2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:04.400\n to discuss the meaning of life.\n\n2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:05.920\n So let me ask you,\n\n2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:09.800\n in your, as a biologist, as a computer scientist,\n\n2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:14.640\n and as a human, what is the meaning of life?\n\n2:16:14.640 --> 2:16:18.880\n I've been asking this question for a long time,\n\n2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:21.160\n ever since my 42nd birthday,\n\n2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:22.080\n but well before that,\n\n2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:25.280\n in even planning the meaning of life symposium.\n\n2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:29.800\n And symposium, sim means together,\n\n2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:31.520\n posy actually means to drink together.\n\n2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:33.560\n So symposium is actually a drinking party.\n\n2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:36.040\n So the meaning.\n\n2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:37.880\n Can you actually elaborate about this meaning of life\n\n2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:39.480\n symposium that you put together?\n\n2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:42.280\n It's like the most genius idea I've ever heard.\n\n2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:44.640\n So 42 is obviously the answer to life,\n\n2:16:44.640 --> 2:16:45.600\n the universe and everything,\n\n2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:47.640\n from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\n2:16:47.640 --> 2:16:49.560\n And as I was turning 42,\n\n2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:51.800\n I've had the theme for every one of my birthdays.\n\n2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:55.640\n When I was turning 32, it's one, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero\n\n2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:56.640\n in binary.\n\n2:16:56.640 --> 2:17:00.080\n So I celebrated my 100,000th binary birthday,\n\n2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:03.640\n and I had a theme of going back 100,000 years,\n\n2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:07.160\n let's dress something in the last 100,000 years.\n\n2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:09.600\n Anyway, it was, I've always had these.\n\n2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:12.320\n It's such an interesting human being.\n\n2:17:12.320 --> 2:17:13.160\n Okay, that's awesome.\n\n2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:16.240\n I've always had these sort of numerology\n\n2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:20.480\n related announcements for my birthday parties.\n\n2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:26.800\n So what came out of that meaning of life symposium\n\n2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:29.720\n is that I basically asked 42 of my colleagues,\n\n2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:33.080\n 42 of my friends, 42 of my collaborators,\n\n2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:35.520\n to basically give seven minutes species\n\n2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:38.520\n on the meaning of life, each from their perspective.\n\n2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:40.600\n And I really encourage you to go there\n\n2:17:40.600 --> 2:17:42.560\n because it's mind boggling\n\n2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:46.280\n that every single person said a different answer.\n\n2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:48.480\n Every single person started with,\n\n2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:50.920\n I don't know what the meaning of life is, but,\n\n2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:54.240\n and then give this beautifully eloquently answer,\n\n2:17:54.240 --> 2:17:55.440\n eloquent answer.\n\n2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:57.320\n And they were all different,\n\n2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:01.360\n but they all were consistent with each other\n\n2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:04.360\n and mutually synergistic and together forming\n\n2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:08.560\n a beautiful view of what it means to be human in many ways.\n\n2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:12.280\n Some people talked about the loss of their loved one,\n\n2:18:12.280 --> 2:18:14.520\n their life partner for many, many years\n\n2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:16.520\n and how their life changed through that.\n\n2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:19.280\n Some people talked about the origin of life.\n\n2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:21.080\n Some people talked about the difference\n\n2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:23.000\n between purpose and meaning.\n\n2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:28.600\n I'll maybe quote one of the answers,\n\n2:18:28.600 --> 2:18:30.880\n which is this linguistics professor,\n\n2:18:30.880 --> 2:18:34.200\n friend of mine at Harvard, who basically said,\n\n2:18:35.880 --> 2:18:37.800\n that she was gonna, she's Greek as well.\n\n2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:40.120\n And she said, I will give a very Pythian answer.\n\n2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:42.960\n So Pythia was the Oracle of Delphi,\n\n2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:45.280\n who would basically give these very cryptic answers,\n\n2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.320\n very short, but interpretable in many different ways.\n\n2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:50.480\n There was this whole set of priests\n\n2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:53.440\n who were tasked with interpreting what Pythia had said.\n\n2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:56.440\n And very often you would not get a clean interpretation,\n\n2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:59.000\n but she said, I will be like Pythia\n\n2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:02.520\n and give you a very short and multiply interpretable answer.\n\n2:19:02.520 --> 2:19:04.800\n But unlike her, I will actually also give you\n\n2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:05.920\n three interpretations.\n\n2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.800\n And she said, the answer to the meaning of life\n\n2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:11.040\n is become one.\n\n2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:16.320\n And the first interpretation is like a child,\n\n2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:18.720\n become one year old with the excitement\n\n2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:21.400\n of discovering everything about the world.\n\n2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:25.040\n Second interpretation, in whatever you take on,\n\n2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:28.840\n become one, the first, the best, excel,\n\n2:19:28.840 --> 2:19:32.600\n drive yourself to perfection for every one of your tasks\n\n2:19:32.600 --> 2:19:37.600\n and become one when people are separate,\n\n2:19:38.480 --> 2:19:42.040\n become one, come together, learn to understand each other.\n\n2:19:43.600 --> 2:19:45.400\n Damn, that's an answer.\n\n2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:46.880\n And one way to summarize\n\n2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:48.760\n this whole meaning of life symposium\n\n2:19:48.760 --> 2:19:52.920\n is that the very symposium was illustrating\n\n2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:54.680\n the quest for meaning,\n\n2:19:54.680 --> 2:19:58.120\n which might itself be the meaning of life.\n\n2:19:58.120 --> 2:20:01.400\n This constant quest for something sublime,\n\n2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:04.880\n something human, something intangible,\n\n2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:09.680\n some aspect of what defines us as a species\n\n2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:11.320\n and as an individual.\n\n2:20:11.320 --> 2:20:16.320\n Both the quest of me as a person through my own life,\n\n2:20:16.360 --> 2:20:19.200\n but the meaning of life could also be\n\n2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:20.840\n the meaning of all of life.\n\n2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:22.040\n What is the whole point of life?\n\n2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:22.880\n Why life?\n\n2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:24.480\n Why life itself?\n\n2:20:24.480 --> 2:20:26.720\n Because we've been talking about the history\n\n2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:28.360\n and evolution of life,\n\n2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:31.080\n but we haven't talked about why life in the first place?\n\n2:20:31.080 --> 2:20:32.520\n Is life inevitable?\n\n2:20:32.520 --> 2:20:35.880\n Is life part of physics?\n\n2:20:35.880 --> 2:20:37.720\n Does life transcend physics\n\n2:20:37.720 --> 2:20:40.320\n by fighting against entropy,\n\n2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:42.960\n by compartmentalizing and increasing concentrations\n\n2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:44.400\n rather than diluting away?\n\n2:20:45.320 --> 2:20:50.320\n Is life a distinct entity in the universe\n\n2:20:51.520 --> 2:20:55.080\n beyond the traditional very simple physical rules\n\n2:20:55.080 --> 2:20:58.560\n that govern gravity and electromagnetism\n\n2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:00.600\n and all of these forces?\n\n2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:02.120\n Is life another force?\n\n2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:03.120\n Is there a life force?\n\n2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:05.920\n Is there a unique kind of set of principles that emerge,\n\n2:21:05.920 --> 2:21:09.080\n of course, built on top of the hardware of physics,\n\n2:21:09.080 --> 2:21:11.840\n but is it sort of a new layer of software\n\n2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:14.400\n or a new layer of a computer system?\n\n2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:18.480\n And so that's at the level of big questions.\n\n2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:21.200\n There's another aspect of gratitude\n\n2:21:21.200 --> 2:21:26.200\n of basically what I like to say is,\n\n2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:27.920\n during this pandemic,\n\n2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:30.800\n I've basically worked from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m.\n\n2:21:30.800 --> 2:21:34.280\n every single day, nonstop, including Saturday and Sunday.\n\n2:21:34.280 --> 2:21:36.440\n I've basically broken all boundaries\n\n2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:39.120\n of where life, personal life begins\n\n2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:42.000\n and work life ends.\n\n2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:46.280\n And that has been exhilarating for me,\n\n2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:50.480\n just the intellectual pleasure that I get\n\n2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:53.840\n from a day of exhaustion,\n\n2:21:53.840 --> 2:21:55.520\n where at the end of the day, my brain is hurting.\n\n2:21:55.520 --> 2:21:59.320\n I'm telling my wife, wow, I was useful today.\n\n2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:04.720\n And there's a certain pleasure\n\n2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:08.360\n that comes from feeling useful.\n\n2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:09.880\n And there's a certain pleasure\n\n2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:11.600\n that comes from feeling grateful.\n\n2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:16.440\n So I've written this little sort of prayer for my kids\n\n2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:19.520\n to say at bedtime every night,\n\n2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:21.000\n where they basically say,\n\n2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.720\n thank you, God, for all you have given me\n\n2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:28.560\n and give me the strength to give onto others\n\n2:22:28.560 --> 2:22:31.200\n with the same love that you have given onto me.\n\n2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:35.680\n We as a species are so special,\n\n2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:39.520\n the only ones who worry about the meaning of life.\n\n2:22:40.800 --> 2:22:43.320\n And maybe that's what makes us human.\n\n2:22:44.680 --> 2:22:47.960\n And what I like to say to my wife and to my students\n\n2:22:47.960 --> 2:22:52.280\n during this pandemic work extravaganza\n\n2:22:53.280 --> 2:22:56.400\n is every now and then they ask me, but how do you do this?\n\n2:22:56.400 --> 2:22:58.880\n And I'm like, I'm a workaholic.\n\n2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:00.880\n I love this.\n\n2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:04.800\n This is me in the most unfiltered way.\n\n2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:07.280\n The ability to do something useful,\n\n2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:09.640\n to feel that my brain is being used,\n\n2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:12.600\n to interact with the smartest people on the planet\n\n2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:15.880\n day in, day out, and to help them discover aspects\n\n2:23:15.880 --> 2:23:18.520\n of the human genome, of the human brain,\n\n2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:21.960\n of human disease and the human condition\n\n2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:24.560\n that no one has seen before\n\n2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:29.560\n with data that we're capturing that has never been observed.\n\n2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:34.480\n And there's another aspect, which is on the personal life.\n\n2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:37.560\n Many people say, oh, I'm not gonna have kids, why bother?\n\n2:23:37.560 --> 2:23:39.160\n I can tell you as a father,\n\n2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:44.560\n they're missing half the picture, if not the whole picture.\n\n2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:49.040\n Teaching my kids about my view of the world\n\n2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:51.200\n and watching through their eyes\n\n2:23:51.200 --> 2:23:53.480\n the naivete with which they start\n\n2:23:53.480 --> 2:23:55.920\n and the sophistication with which they end up,\n\n2:23:56.920 --> 2:24:00.080\n the understanding that they have\n\n2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:02.720\n of not just the natural world around them, but of me too.\n\n2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:10.120\n The unfiltered criticism that you get from your own children\n\n2:24:10.120 --> 2:24:13.800\n that knows no bounds of honesty.\n\n2:24:15.200 --> 2:24:18.840\n And I've grown components of my heart\n\n2:24:18.840 --> 2:24:20.800\n that I didn't know I had\n\n2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:25.000\n until you sense that fragility,\n\n2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:28.880\n that vulnerability of the children,\n\n2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:33.040\n that immense love and passion,\n\n2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:36.560\n the unfiltered egoism,\n\n2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:40.080\n that we as adults learn how to hide so much better.\n\n2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:43.720\n It's just this back of emotions\n\n2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:48.720\n that tell me about the raw materials that make a human being\n\n2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:50.880\n and how these raw materials can be arranged\n\n2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:53.880\n with more sophistication that we learn through life\n\n2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:56.760\n to become truly human adults.\n\n2:24:57.760 --> 2:24:59.960\n But there's something so beautiful\n\n2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:02.480\n about seeing that progression between them\n\n2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:05.040\n and seeing that progress and that progress\n\n2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:07.280\n and that progression between them,\n\n2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:10.600\n the complexity of the language growing\n\n2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:12.720\n as more neural connections are formed\n\n2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:18.560\n to realize that the hardware is getting rearranged\n\n2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:21.600\n as their software is getting implemented on that hardware,\n\n2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:24.880\n that their frontal cortex continues to grow\n\n2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:26.160\n for another 10 years.\n\n2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:29.960\n There's neuronal connections that are continuing to form,\n\n2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:33.120\n new neurons that actually get replicated and formed.\n\n2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:38.120\n And it's just incredible that we have these,\n\n2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:40.680\n not just you grow the hardware for 30 years\n\n2:25:40.680 --> 2:25:42.640\n and then you feed it all of the knowledge.\n\n2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:45.200\n No, no, the knowledge is fed throughout\n\n2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:48.480\n and is shaping these neural connections as they're forming.\n\n2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:52.840\n So seeing that transformation from either your own blood\n\n2:25:52.840 --> 2:25:54.560\n or from an adopted child\n\n2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:57.520\n is the most beautiful thing you can do as a human being.\n\n2:25:57.520 --> 2:26:00.760\n And it completes you, it completes that path, that journey.\n\n2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:04.880\n The create life, oh sure, that's at conception, that's easy.\n\n2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:08.400\n But create human life to add the human part,\n\n2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:13.160\n that takes decades of compassion, of sharing,\n\n2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:18.160\n of love and of anger and of impatience and patience.\n\n2:26:18.640 --> 2:26:21.880\n And as a parent,\n\n2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:24.960\n I think I've become a very different kind of teacher\n\n2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:27.080\n because again, I'm a professor.\n\n2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:31.040\n My first role is to bring adult human beings\n\n2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:34.440\n into a more mature level of adulthood\n\n2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:37.040\n where they learn not just to do science,\n\n2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:39.840\n but they learn the process of discovery\n\n2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:42.280\n and the process of collaboration, the process of sharing,\n\n2:26:42.280 --> 2:26:44.840\n the process of conveying the knowledge\n\n2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:48.000\n of encapsulating something incredibly complex\n\n2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.200\n and sort of giving it up in sort of bite sized chunks\n\n2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:54.400\n that the rest of humanity can appreciate.\n\n2:26:54.400 --> 2:26:57.440\n I tell my students all the time, if you, you know,\n\n2:26:57.440 --> 2:26:58.720\n like when an apple fall,\n\n2:26:58.720 --> 2:27:00.840\n when a tree falls in the forest\n\n2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:03.040\n and no one's there to listen, has it really fallen?\n\n2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:05.280\n The same way you do this awesome research,\n\n2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:08.640\n if you write an impenetrable paper that no one will understand,\n\n2:27:08.640 --> 2:27:11.040\n it's as if you never did the awesome research.\n\n2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:15.200\n So conveying of knowledge, conveying this lateral transfer\n\n2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:17.520\n that I was talking about at the very beginning\n\n2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:22.480\n of sort of humanity and sort of the sharing of information,\n\n2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:27.200\n all of that has gotten so much more rich\n\n2:27:27.200 --> 2:27:30.920\n by seeing human beings grow in my own home\n\n2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:35.080\n because that makes me a better parent\n\n2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:38.920\n and that makes me a better teacher and a better mentor\n\n2:27:38.920 --> 2:27:42.240\n to the nurturing of my adult children,\n\n2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:43.960\n which are my research group.\n\n2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:48.280\n First of all, beautifully put, connects beautifully\n\n2:27:48.280 --> 2:27:52.240\n to the vertical and the horizontal inheritance of ideas\n\n2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:54.440\n that we talked about at the very beginning.\n\n2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:57.320\n I don't think there's a better way to end it\n\n2:27:57.320 --> 2:28:01.320\n on this poetic and powerful note.\n\n2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:02.920\n Manolis, thank you so much for talking to me.\n\n2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:03.760\n It was a huge honor.\n\n2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:07.240\n We'll have to talk again about the origin of life,\n\n2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:10.520\n about epigenetics, epigenomics,\n\n2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:13.600\n and some of the incredible research you're doing.\n\n2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:15.320\n Truly an honor. Thanks so much for talking to me.\n\n2:28:15.320 --> 2:28:17.240\n Thank you. Such a pleasure. It's such a pleasure.\n\n2:28:17.240 --> 2:28:19.080\n I mean, your questions are outstanding.\n\n2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:21.880\n I've had such a blast here and I can't wait to be back.\n\n2:28:21.880 --> 2:28:23.240\n Awesome.\n\n2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:24.800\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:28.000\n with Manolis Kellis, and thank you to our sponsors,\n\n2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:31.360\n Blinkist, 8sleep, and Masterclass.\n\n2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:33.200\n Please consider supporting this podcast\n\n2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:35.640\n by going to blinkist.com slash lex,\n\n2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:40.640\n 8sleep.com slash lex, and masterclass.com slash lex.\n\n2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:44.160\n Click the links, buy the stuff, get the discount.\n\n2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:47.040\n It's the best way to support this podcast.\n\n2:28:47.040 --> 2:28:48.800\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:50.920\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:52.280\n support it on Patreon,\n\n2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:55.480\n or connect with me on Twitter at lexfreedman.\n\n2:28:55.480 --> 2:28:57.360\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:00.080\n from Charles Darwin that I think Manolis\n\n2:29:00.080 --> 2:29:01.680\n represents quite beautifully.\n\n2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:04.840\n If I had my life to live over again,\n\n2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:07.560\n I would have made a rule to read some poetry\n\n2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:11.640\n and listen to some music at least once every week.\n\n2:29:11.640 --> 2:29:23.640\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
