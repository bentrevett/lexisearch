00:09.400\n genocide, war, and empire.\n\n00:09.400 --> 00:11.600\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:11.600 --> 00:13.860\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:13.860 --> 00:15.080\n in the description.\n\n00:15.080 --> 00:18.960\n And now, here's my conversation with Norman Namark.\n\n00:20.160 --> 00:22.500\n Did Stalin believe that communism was good\n\n00:22.500 --> 00:25.400\n not just for him, but for the people of the Soviet Union\n\n00:25.400 --> 00:26.960\n and the people of the world?\n\n00:26.960 --> 00:31.040\n Oh, absolutely, I mean, Stalin believed that, you know,\n\n00:31.040 --> 00:34.600\n socialism was the be all and end all of,\n\n00:34.600 --> 00:36.800\n you know, human existence.\n\n00:36.800 --> 00:38.440\n I mean, he was a true Leninist,\n\n00:38.440 --> 00:42.200\n and in Lenin's tradition, this was, you know,\n\n00:42.200 --> 00:43.180\n what he believed.\n\n00:43.180 --> 00:46.360\n I mean, that set of beliefs didn't exclude\n\n00:46.360 --> 00:49.900\n other kinds of things he believed or thought or did.\n\n00:49.900 --> 00:53.960\n But, no, the way he defined socialism,\n\n00:53.960 --> 00:55.920\n the way he thought about socialism,\n\n00:55.920 --> 00:57.760\n you know, he absolutely thought it was in the interest\n\n00:57.760 --> 00:59.520\n of the Soviet Union and of the world.\n\n00:59.520 --> 01:02.600\n And, in fact, that the world was one day going to go\n\n01:02.600 --> 01:03.840\n socialist, in other words.\n\n01:03.840 --> 01:06.620\n I think he believed in, eventually,\n\n01:06.620 --> 01:08.320\n in the international revolution.\n\n01:09.280 --> 01:13.880\n So, given the genocide in the 1930s that you describe,\n\n01:13.880 --> 01:17.440\n was Stalin evil, delusional, or incompetent?\n\n01:20.060 --> 01:22.520\n Evil, delusional, or incompetent.\n\n01:22.520 --> 01:25.540\n Well, you know, evil is one of those words,\n\n01:25.540 --> 01:27.940\n you know, which has a lot of kind of religious\n\n01:27.940 --> 01:30.700\n and moral connotations.\n\n01:30.700 --> 01:33.320\n And, in that sense, yes, I think he was an evil man.\n\n01:33.320 --> 01:36.920\n I mean, he, you know, eliminated people\n\n01:36.920 --> 01:38.760\n absolutely unnecessarily.\n\n01:38.760 --> 01:42.140\n He tortured people, had people tortured.\n\n01:43.040 --> 01:48.040\n He was completely indifferent to the suffering of others.\n\n01:48.400 --> 01:51.080\n He couldn't have carried a wit, you know,\n\n01:51.080 --> 01:54.880\n that millions were suffering.\n\n01:54.880 --> 01:58.600\n And so, yes, I consider him an evil man.\n\n01:58.600 --> 02:01.160\n I mean, you know, historians don't like to.\n\n02:01.160 --> 02:02.000\n Use the word evil.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:02.840\n Use the word evil.\n\n02:02.840 --> 02:05.380\n It's, you know, it's a word for moral philosophers,\n\n02:05.380 --> 02:10.380\n but I think it certainly fits who he is.\n\n02:11.640 --> 02:14.080\n I think he was delusional.\n\n02:14.080 --> 02:18.000\n And there is a wonderful historian at Princeton,\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:20.680\n a political scientist, actually, named Robert Tucker,\n\n02:20.680 --> 02:25.680\n who said he suffered from a paranoid delusional system.\n\n02:26.480 --> 02:30.360\n And I always remember that of Tucker's writing\n\n02:30.360 --> 02:35.280\n because what Tucker meant is that he was not just paranoid,\n\n02:35.280 --> 02:37.640\n meaning, you know, I'm paranoid.\n\n02:37.640 --> 02:39.960\n I'm worried you're out to get me, right?\n\n02:39.960 --> 02:44.960\n But that he constructed whole plots of people,\n\n02:44.960 --> 02:48.880\n whole systems of people who were out to get him.\n\n02:48.880 --> 02:51.760\n So, in other words, his delusions were that there were\n\n02:51.760 --> 02:54.000\n all of these groups of people out there\n\n02:55.320 --> 02:58.080\n who were out to diminish his power\n\n02:58.080 --> 03:01.840\n and remove him from his position\n\n03:01.840 --> 03:04.840\n and undermine the Soviet Union, in his view.\n\n03:04.840 --> 03:09.840\n So, yes, I think he did suffer from delusions.\n\n03:10.320 --> 03:12.240\n And this had a huge effect,\n\n03:12.240 --> 03:17.240\n because whole groups then were destroyed by his activities,\n\n03:18.160 --> 03:23.160\n which he would construct based on these delusions.\n\n03:23.480 --> 03:24.800\n He was not incompetent.\n\n03:24.800 --> 03:26.760\n He was an extremely competent man.\n\n03:26.760 --> 03:30.040\n I mean, I think most of the research that's gone on,\n\n03:30.040 --> 03:34.080\n especially since the Stalin archive was opened\n\n03:34.080 --> 03:36.040\n at the beginning of the century,\n\n03:36.040 --> 03:38.960\n and I think almost every historian who goes in that archive\n\n03:38.960 --> 03:40.800\n comes away from that archive\n\n03:40.800 --> 03:45.800\n with the feeling of a man who is enormously hardworking,\n\n03:45.800 --> 03:49.880\n intelligent, you know, with an acute sense of politics,\n\n03:49.880 --> 03:54.880\n a really excellent sense of political rhetoric,\n\n03:56.160 --> 04:00.200\n a fantastic editor, you know, in a kind of agitational sense.\n\n04:00.200 --> 04:02.400\n I mean, he's a real agitator, right?\n\n04:02.400 --> 04:07.400\n And of a, you know, a really hard worker.\n\n04:07.400 --> 04:09.560\n I mean, somebody who works from morning till night\n\n04:09.560 --> 04:12.400\n a micromanager in some ways.\n\n04:12.400 --> 04:15.680\n So his competence, I think, was really extreme.\n\n04:15.680 --> 04:18.240\n Now, there were times when that fell down,\n\n04:18.240 --> 04:21.400\n you know, times in the 30s, times in the 20s,\n\n04:21.400 --> 04:24.040\n times during the war where he made mistakes.\n\n04:24.040 --> 04:26.720\n It's not as if he didn't make any mistakes.\n\n04:26.720 --> 04:29.080\n But I think, you know, you look at his stuff,\n\n04:29.080 --> 04:31.920\n you know, you look at his archives, you look what he did.\n\n04:31.920 --> 04:34.560\n I mean, this is an enormously competent man\n\n04:34.560 --> 04:38.560\n who in many, many different areas of his life,\n\n04:38.560 --> 04:42.440\n areas of enterprise, because he, you know,\n\n04:42.440 --> 04:44.840\n he had this notion that he should know everything\n\n04:44.840 --> 04:46.640\n and did know everything.\n\n04:46.640 --> 04:50.880\n I remember one archive, it's called, you know,\n\n04:50.880 --> 04:52.360\n a kind of folder that I looked at\n\n04:52.360 --> 04:56.280\n where he actually went through the wines\n\n04:56.280 --> 04:59.480\n that were produced in his native Georgia\n\n04:59.480 --> 05:03.360\n and wrote down how much they should make\n\n05:03.360 --> 05:05.080\n of each of these wines, you know,\n\n05:05.080 --> 05:10.000\n how many barrels they should produce of these wines,\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.160\n which grapes were better than the other grapes,\n\n05:12.160 --> 05:14.280\n sort of correcting, in other words,\n\n05:14.280 --> 05:16.640\n what people were putting down there.\n\n05:16.640 --> 05:20.800\n So he was, you know, his competence ranged very wide,\n\n05:20.800 --> 05:23.440\n or at least he thought his competence ranged very wide.\n\n05:23.440 --> 05:25.680\n I mean, both things, I think, are the case.\n\n05:25.680 --> 05:27.800\n If we look at this paranoid delusional system,\n\n05:27.800 --> 05:29.840\n Stalin was in power for 30 years.\n\n05:29.840 --> 05:34.840\n He is, many argue, one of the most powerful men in history.\n\n05:35.760 --> 05:38.560\n Did, in his case, absolute power corrupt him\n\n05:38.560 --> 05:40.960\n or did it reveal the true nature of the man?\n\n05:40.960 --> 05:43.440\n And maybe just in your sense,\n\n05:43.440 --> 05:45.520\n as we kind of build around this genocide\n\n05:45.520 --> 05:50.280\n of the early 1930s, this paranoid delusional system,\n\n05:50.280 --> 05:52.760\n did it get built up over time?\n\n05:52.760 --> 05:54.560\n Was it always there?\n\n05:54.560 --> 05:59.560\n It's kind of a question of did the genocide,\n\n06:00.240 --> 06:03.200\n was that always inevitable, essentially, in this man,\n\n06:03.200 --> 06:05.880\n or did power create that?\n\n06:05.880 --> 06:08.440\n I mean, it's a great question, and I don't think you can,\n\n06:08.440 --> 06:11.040\n I don't think you can say that it was always\n\n06:12.200 --> 06:14.440\n kind of inherent in the man.\n\n06:14.440 --> 06:18.680\n I mean, the man without his position and without his power,\n\n06:18.680 --> 06:21.000\n you know, wouldn't have been able to accomplish\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:25.000\n what he eventually did in the way of murdering people,\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:26.520\n you know, and murdering groups of people,\n\n06:26.520 --> 06:28.800\n which is what genocide is.\n\n06:28.800 --> 06:32.720\n So, you know, I don't, it wasn't sort of in him.\n\n06:32.720 --> 06:34.120\n I mean, there were, and again, you know,\n\n06:34.120 --> 06:36.960\n the new research has shown that, you know,\n\n06:36.960 --> 06:39.520\n he had his childhood was, you know,\n\n06:39.520 --> 06:42.320\n not a particularly nasty one.\n\n06:42.320 --> 06:45.720\n People used to say, you know, the father beat him up,\n\n06:45.720 --> 06:47.480\n and it turns out, actually, it wasn't the father,\n\n06:47.480 --> 06:49.320\n it was the mother once in a while.\n\n06:49.320 --> 06:51.920\n But basically, you know, he was not\n\n06:51.920 --> 06:56.920\n an unusual young Georgian kid or student even.\n\n06:56.960 --> 07:01.040\n And, you know, it was the growth of the Soviet system\n\n07:01.040 --> 07:04.720\n and him within the Soviet system,\n\n07:04.720 --> 07:07.800\n I mean, his own development within the Soviet system,\n\n07:07.800 --> 07:12.800\n I think that led, you know, to the kind of mass killing\n\n07:13.040 --> 07:15.360\n that occurred in the 1930s.\n\n07:15.360 --> 07:19.720\n You know, he essentially achieved complete power\n\n07:19.720 --> 07:22.440\n by the early 1930s.\n\n07:22.440 --> 07:25.640\n And then as he, as he rolled with it,\n\n07:25.640 --> 07:28.200\n as you would say, you know, or people would say,\n\n07:29.200 --> 07:32.800\n you know, it increasingly became murderous.\n\n07:32.800 --> 07:36.680\n And there was no, you know, there were no checks\n\n07:36.680 --> 07:39.800\n and balances, obviously, on that murderous system.\n\n07:39.800 --> 07:43.160\n And not only that, you know, people supported it\n\n07:43.160 --> 07:45.600\n in the NKVD and elsewhere, he learned\n\n07:45.600 --> 07:46.880\n how to manipulate people.\n\n07:46.880 --> 07:51.480\n I mean, he was a superb, you know, political manipulator\n\n07:51.480 --> 07:54.720\n of those people around him.\n\n07:54.720 --> 07:59.720\n And, you know, we have, we've got new transcripts,\n\n08:00.960 --> 08:03.960\n for example, of, you know, police bureau meetings\n\n08:03.960 --> 08:05.920\n in the early 1930s.\n\n08:05.920 --> 08:07.640\n And you read those things and you read, you know,\n\n08:07.640 --> 08:12.640\n he uses humor and he uses sarcasm, especially,\n\n08:12.640 --> 08:17.000\n he uses verbal ways to undermine people, you know,\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.600\n to control their behavior and what they do.\n\n08:20.600 --> 08:25.280\n And he's a really, you know, he's a real,\n\n08:25.280 --> 08:27.200\n I guess, manipulator is the right word.\n\n08:27.200 --> 08:31.400\n And he does it, he does it with, you know,\n\n08:31.400 --> 08:35.920\n a kind of skill that on the one hand is admirable.\n\n08:35.920 --> 08:39.760\n And on the other hand, of course, is terrible\n\n08:39.760 --> 08:43.560\n because it ends up, you know, creating the system\n\n08:43.560 --> 08:46.400\n of terror that he creates.\n\n08:48.040 --> 08:50.680\n I mean, I guess just to linger on it,\n\n08:50.680 --> 08:53.120\n I just wonder how much of it is a slippery slope\n\n08:54.160 --> 08:58.600\n in the early 20s, 1920s, did he think he was going\n\n08:58.600 --> 09:00.520\n to be murdering even a single person,\n\n09:00.520 --> 09:04.920\n but thousands and millions?\n\n09:04.920 --> 09:09.920\n I just wonder maybe the murder of a single human being\n\n09:14.080 --> 09:17.760\n just to get them, you know, because you're paranoid\n\n09:17.760 --> 09:19.920\n about them potentially threatening your power,\n\n09:19.920 --> 09:22.240\n does that murder then open a door?\n\n09:22.240 --> 09:23.960\n And once you open the door,\n\n09:23.960 --> 09:25.960\n you become a different human being.\n\n09:25.960 --> 09:29.040\n A deeper question here is the soldier Knitsen,\n\n09:29.040 --> 09:31.040\n you know, the line between good and evil runs\n\n09:31.040 --> 09:34.600\n in every man, are all of us once we commit one murder\n\n09:34.600 --> 09:37.960\n in the situation, does that open a door for all of us?\n\n09:37.960 --> 09:41.760\n And I guess even the further deeper questions,\n\n09:41.760 --> 09:45.400\n how easy it is for human nature to go\n\n09:45.400 --> 09:49.040\n on the slippery slope that ends in genocide?\n\n09:49.040 --> 09:52.400\n There are a lot of questions in those questions.\n\n09:52.400 --> 09:55.920\n And, you know, the slippery slope question\n\n09:55.920 --> 10:00.400\n I would answer, I suppose by saying, you know,\n\n10:00.400 --> 10:04.120\n Stalin wasn't the most likely successor of Lenin,\n\n10:04.120 --> 10:07.880\n there were plenty of others, there were a lot\n\n10:07.880 --> 10:12.680\n of political contingencies that emerged in the 1920s\n\n10:12.680 --> 10:16.680\n that made it possible for Stalin to seize power.\n\n10:16.680 --> 10:19.880\n I don't think of him as, you know,\n\n10:19.880 --> 10:22.880\n if you would just know him in 1925,\n\n10:22.880 --> 10:25.960\n I don't think anybody would say much less himself\n\n10:25.960 --> 10:28.840\n that this was a future mass murderer.\n\n10:28.840 --> 10:32.040\n I mean, Trotsky mistrusted him and thought he was,\n\n10:32.040 --> 10:36.360\n you know, a mindless bureaucrat.\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:39.520\n You know, others were less mistrustful of him,\n\n10:39.520 --> 10:41.760\n but, you know, he managed to gain power\n\n10:41.760 --> 10:43.600\n in the way he did through this bureaucratic\n\n10:43.600 --> 10:47.960\n and political maneuvering that was very successful.\n\n10:49.040 --> 10:52.000\n You know, the slippery slope, as it were,\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:55.600\n doesn't really begin until the 1930s, in my view.\n\n10:55.600 --> 10:58.840\n In other words, once he gains complete power\n\n10:58.840 --> 11:01.360\n and control of the Politburo,\n\n11:01.360 --> 11:05.880\n once the programs that he institutes\n\n11:05.880 --> 11:10.120\n of the Five Year Plan and collectivization go through,\n\n11:10.120 --> 11:14.040\n once he reverses himself and is able to reverse himself\n\n11:14.040 --> 11:17.160\n or reverse the Soviet path, you know,\n\n11:17.160 --> 11:20.560\n to give various nationalities their, you know,\n\n11:20.560 --> 11:22.960\n their ability to develop their own cultures\n\n11:22.960 --> 11:27.960\n and sort of internal politics, once he reverses all that,\n\n11:27.960 --> 11:32.160\n you know, you have the Ukrainian famine in 32, 33,\n\n11:32.160 --> 11:34.400\n you have the murder of Kirov,\n\n11:34.400 --> 11:38.040\n who is one of the leading figures, you know,\n\n11:38.040 --> 11:41.080\n in the political system, you have the suicide of his wife,\n\n11:41.080 --> 11:45.480\n you have all these things come together in 32, 33\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:50.480\n that then, you know, make it more likely,\n\n11:50.600 --> 11:53.920\n in other words, that bad things are gonna happen.\n\n11:53.920 --> 11:57.760\n And people start seeing that, too, around him.\n\n11:57.760 --> 12:00.880\n They start seeing that it's not a slippery slope,\n\n12:00.880 --> 12:05.880\n it's a dangerous, it's a dangerous situation\n\n12:06.160 --> 12:10.000\n which is emerging, and some people really understand that.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:13.160\n So I don't, I really do see a differentiation\n\n12:13.160 --> 12:14.640\n then between the 20s.\n\n12:14.640 --> 12:17.360\n I mean, it's true that Stalin, during the Civil War,\n\n12:17.360 --> 12:20.120\n there's a lot of, you know, good research on that,\n\n12:21.240 --> 12:24.080\n you know, shows that he already had some of these\n\n12:24.080 --> 12:27.520\n characteristics of being, as it were, murderous\n\n12:27.520 --> 12:32.520\n and being, you know, being dictatorial\n\n12:32.720 --> 12:34.680\n and pushing people around and that sort of thing.\n\n12:34.680 --> 12:38.560\n That was all there, but I don't really see that\n\n12:38.560 --> 12:40.800\n as kind of the necessary stage\n\n12:40.800 --> 12:43.520\n for the next thing that came, which was the 30s,\n\n12:43.520 --> 12:46.800\n which was really terror of the worst sort,\n\n12:46.800 --> 12:49.360\n you know, where everybody's afraid for their lives\n\n12:49.360 --> 12:51.600\n and most people are afraid for their lives\n\n12:51.600 --> 12:54.440\n and their family's lives and where torture\n\n12:54.440 --> 12:57.120\n and that sort of thing becomes a common part,\n\n12:57.120 --> 13:00.360\n you know, of who, what people had to face.\n\n13:00.360 --> 13:03.160\n So it's a different, it's a different world.\n\n13:03.160 --> 13:04.840\n And you know, people will argue,\n\n13:04.840 --> 13:09.840\n they'll argue this kind of Lenin, Stalin continuity debate,\n\n13:10.240 --> 13:11.280\n you know, that's been going on\n\n13:11.280 --> 13:13.120\n since I was an undergraduate, right?\n\n13:13.120 --> 13:16.160\n That argument, you know, was Stalin the natural\n\n13:16.160 --> 13:19.120\n sort of next step from Lenin\n\n13:19.120 --> 13:21.200\n or was he something completely different?\n\n13:23.040 --> 13:24.400\n Many people will argue, you know,\n\n13:24.400 --> 13:27.760\n because of Marxism, Leninism, because of the ideology\n\n13:27.760 --> 13:30.840\n that, you know, it was the natural,\n\n13:30.840 --> 13:32.680\n it was a kind of natural next step.\n\n13:32.680 --> 13:33.960\n I don't think so.\n\n13:33.960 --> 13:36.280\n You know, I would tend to lean the other way.\n\n13:36.280 --> 13:37.240\n Not absolutely.\n\n13:37.240 --> 13:40.120\n I mean, I won't make an absolute argument\n\n13:40.120 --> 13:43.520\n that what Stalin became had nothing to do with Lenin\n\n13:43.520 --> 13:45.560\n and nothing to do with Marxism, Leninism.\n\n13:45.560 --> 13:47.360\n It had a lot to do with it.\n\n13:47.360 --> 13:51.560\n But you know, he takes it one major step further.\n\n13:51.560 --> 13:53.800\n And again, that's why I don't like the slippery slope,\n\n13:53.800 --> 13:54.680\n you know, metaphor,\n\n13:54.680 --> 13:57.240\n because that means it's kind of slow and easy.\n\n13:57.240 --> 13:58.320\n It's a leap.\n\n13:58.320 --> 14:00.480\n And we call, you know, I mean,\n\n14:00.480 --> 14:03.400\n historians talk about the Stalin revolution,\n\n14:03.400 --> 14:05.960\n you know, in 28 and 29, you know,\n\n14:05.960 --> 14:10.960\n that he, in some senses, creates a whole new system,\n\n14:11.200 --> 14:13.400\n you know, through the five year plan,\n\n14:13.400 --> 14:15.760\n collectivization and seizing political power\n\n14:15.760 --> 14:16.720\n the way he does.\n\n14:17.800 --> 14:19.440\n Can you talk about the 1930s?\n\n14:19.440 --> 14:21.680\n Can you describe what happened in Holodomor,\n\n14:21.680 --> 14:23.560\n the Soviet terror famine in Ukraine\n\n14:23.560 --> 14:25.200\n in the 32 and 33?\n\n14:25.200 --> 14:26.040\n Yes.\n\n14:26.040 --> 14:27.200\n That killed millions of Ukrainians.\n\n14:27.200 --> 14:28.040\n Right.\n\n14:28.040 --> 14:29.720\n It's a long story, you know,\n\n14:29.720 --> 14:34.120\n but let me try to be as succinct as I can be.\n\n14:34.120 --> 14:39.120\n I mean, the Holodomor, the terror famine of 32, 33\n\n14:40.160 --> 14:45.160\n comes out of, in part, an all union famine\n\n14:46.120 --> 14:49.800\n that is the result of collectivization.\n\n14:49.800 --> 14:52.200\n You know, collectivization was a catastrophe.\n\n14:52.200 --> 14:56.000\n You know, the more or less, the so called kulaks,\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.960\n the more or less richer farmers,\n\n14:57.960 --> 15:00.160\n I mean, they weren't really rich, right?\n\n15:00.160 --> 15:03.160\n Anybody with a tin roof and a cow was considered a kulak,\n\n15:03.160 --> 15:05.040\n you know, and other people who had nothing\n\n15:05.040 --> 15:09.160\n were also considered kulaks if they opposed collectivization.\n\n15:09.160 --> 15:12.360\n So these kulaks, we're talking millions of them, right?\n\n15:12.360 --> 15:15.040\n And Ukraine, it's worth recalling,\n\n15:15.040 --> 15:16.480\n and I'm sure you know this,\n\n15:16.480 --> 15:19.280\n was a, you know, heavily agricultural area,\n\n15:19.280 --> 15:22.520\n and Ukrainian peasants, you know,\n\n15:22.520 --> 15:27.120\n were in the countryside and resisted collectivization\n\n15:27.120 --> 15:32.080\n more than even Russian peasants resisted collectivization,\n\n15:33.120 --> 15:35.480\n suffered during this collectivization program.\n\n15:35.480 --> 15:38.600\n And they, you know, burned sometimes their own houses,\n\n15:38.600 --> 15:40.520\n they killed their own animals,\n\n15:41.480 --> 15:45.120\n they were shot, you know, sometimes on the spot,\n\n15:45.120 --> 15:50.000\n and tens of thousands and others were sent into exile.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.280\n So there was a conflagration in the countryside.\n\n15:53.280 --> 15:55.640\n And the result of that conflagration\n\n15:55.640 --> 15:58.080\n in Ukraine was terrible famine.\n\n15:58.080 --> 16:01.000\n And again, there was famine all over the Soviet Union,\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:04.800\n but it was especially bad in Ukraine,\n\n16:04.800 --> 16:07.880\n in part because Ukrainian peasants resisted.\n\n16:07.880 --> 16:10.680\n Now in 3233, a couple of things happen.\n\n16:12.400 --> 16:14.480\n I mean, I've argued this in my writing,\n\n16:14.480 --> 16:18.160\n and, you know, I've also worked on this,\n\n16:18.160 --> 16:19.960\n I continue to work on it, by the way,\n\n16:19.960 --> 16:24.160\n with a museum in Kiev that's going to be\n\n16:24.160 --> 16:25.840\n about the Holodomor.\n\n16:25.840 --> 16:27.480\n They're building the museum now,\n\n16:27.480 --> 16:32.000\n and it's going to be a very impressive set of exhibits,\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.280\n and talk with historians all the time about it.\n\n16:34.280 --> 16:37.360\n So what happens in 3233, a couple of things.\n\n16:37.360 --> 16:41.360\n First of all, the Stalin develops,\n\n16:41.360 --> 16:46.240\n develops an even stronger, I say even stronger,\n\n16:46.240 --> 16:49.240\n because they already had an antipathy for the Ukrainians,\n\n16:49.240 --> 16:53.120\n an even stronger antipathy for the Ukrainians in general.\n\n16:53.120 --> 16:55.920\n First of all, they resist collectivization.\n\n16:55.920 --> 16:59.120\n Second of all, he's not getting all the grain he wants\n\n16:59.120 --> 17:02.000\n out of them, and which he needs.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:07.000\n And so he sends in, then, people to expropriate the grain,\n\n17:07.080 --> 17:09.480\n and take the grain away from the peasants.\n\n17:09.480 --> 17:12.840\n These teams of people, you know, some policemen,\n\n17:12.840 --> 17:16.560\n some urban thugs, some party people,\n\n17:16.560 --> 17:19.320\n some poor peasants, you know, take part too,\n\n17:19.320 --> 17:23.880\n go into the villages, and forcibly seize grain\n\n17:23.880 --> 17:28.480\n and animals from the Ukrainian peasantry.\n\n17:28.480 --> 17:29.920\n They're seizing it all over.\n\n17:29.920 --> 17:30.960\n I mean, let's remember again,\n\n17:30.960 --> 17:34.760\n this is all over the Soviet Union, in 32, especially.\n\n17:34.760 --> 17:39.760\n Then, you know, in December of 1932, January of 33,\n\n17:42.360 --> 17:47.360\n February of 33, Stalin has convinced the Ukrainian peasantry\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.760\n needs to be shown who's boss,\n\n17:52.960 --> 17:55.600\n that they're not turning over their grain,\n\n17:55.600 --> 17:57.880\n that they're resisting the expropriators,\n\n17:57.880 --> 17:59.120\n that they're hiding the grain,\n\n17:59.120 --> 18:01.480\n which they do sometimes, right?\n\n18:01.480 --> 18:05.560\n That they're basically not loyal to the Soviet Union,\n\n18:05.560 --> 18:07.480\n that they're acting like traitors,\n\n18:07.480 --> 18:10.320\n that they're ready, and he says this, you know,\n\n18:10.320 --> 18:12.560\n I think it's Kaganovich he says it too,\n\n18:12.560 --> 18:14.160\n you know, they're ready to kind of pull out\n\n18:14.160 --> 18:15.840\n of the Soviet Union and join Poland.\n\n18:15.840 --> 18:17.440\n I mean, he thinks Poland is, you know,\n\n18:17.440 --> 18:21.880\n out to get Ukraine, and so he's gonna then,\n\n18:21.880 --> 18:23.960\n essentially, break the back of these peasantry.\n\n18:23.960 --> 18:25.640\n And the way he breaks their back\n\n18:26.880 --> 18:30.480\n is by going through another expropriation program,\n\n18:30.480 --> 18:33.320\n which is not done in the rest of the Soviet Union.\n\n18:33.320 --> 18:36.200\n So he's taking away everything they have,\n\n18:36.200 --> 18:38.240\n everything they have.\n\n18:38.240 --> 18:40.080\n There are new laws introduced,\n\n18:40.080 --> 18:42.680\n where they will actually punish people,\n\n18:42.680 --> 18:47.600\n including kids, with death, if they steal any grain,\n\n18:47.600 --> 18:49.600\n you know, if they take anything from the,\n\n18:49.600 --> 18:51.120\n you know, from the fields.\n\n18:51.120 --> 18:53.680\n So, you know, you can shoot anybody,\n\n18:53.680 --> 18:55.640\n you know, who is looking for food.\n\n18:55.640 --> 18:58.720\n And then he introduces measures in Ukraine,\n\n18:58.720 --> 19:02.120\n which are not introduced into the rest of the Soviet Union.\n\n19:02.120 --> 19:05.200\n For example, the Ukrainian peasantry\n\n19:05.200 --> 19:07.880\n are not allowed to leave their villages anymore.\n\n19:08.880 --> 19:11.120\n They can't go to the city to try to find some things.\n\n19:11.120 --> 19:13.000\n I mean, we've got pictures of, you know,\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.880\n Ukrainian peasants dying on the sidewalks\n\n19:15.880 --> 19:19.560\n in Kharkiv, and in Kiev, and places like that,\n\n19:19.560 --> 19:21.240\n who've managed to get out of the village\n\n19:21.240 --> 19:24.040\n and get to the cities, but now they can't leave.\n\n19:24.040 --> 19:28.080\n They can't leave Ukraine to go to Belorussia,\n\n19:28.080 --> 19:32.800\n or Belarus today, or to Russia, you know, to get any food.\n\n19:32.800 --> 19:36.760\n There's no, he won't allow any relief to Ukraine.\n\n19:36.760 --> 19:39.600\n Number of people offer relief, including the Poles,\n\n19:39.600 --> 19:42.120\n but also the Vatican offers relief.\n\n19:42.120 --> 19:44.400\n He won't allow any relief to Ukraine.\n\n19:44.400 --> 19:47.280\n He won't admit that there's a famine in Ukraine.\n\n19:47.280 --> 19:52.280\n And instead, what happens is that Ukraine turns into,\n\n19:52.280 --> 19:58.280\n the Ukrainian countryside turns into what my now past\n\n19:58.280 --> 20:01.120\n colleague who died several years ago, Robert Conquest,\n\n20:01.120 --> 20:04.040\n called a vast Belsen.\n\n20:04.040 --> 20:06.320\n And by that, you know, the image is of bodies\n\n20:06.320 --> 20:10.080\n just lying everywhere, you know, people dead.\n\n20:10.080 --> 20:15.080\n And dying, you know, of hunger, which is, by the way,\n\n20:16.200 --> 20:19.520\n I mean, as you know, I've spent a lot of time\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:21.640\n studying genocide, I don't think there's anything worse\n\n20:21.640 --> 20:24.080\n than dying of hunger from what I have read.\n\n20:24.080 --> 20:27.160\n I mean, you see terrible ways that people die, right?\n\n20:27.160 --> 20:31.200\n But dying of hunger is just such a horrible, horrible thing.\n\n20:31.200 --> 20:35.680\n And so, for example, we know there were many cases\n\n20:35.680 --> 20:37.240\n of cannibalism in the countryside\n\n20:37.240 --> 20:38.760\n because there wasn't anything to eat.\n\n20:38.760 --> 20:41.800\n People were eating their own kids, right?\n\n20:41.800 --> 20:43.120\n And Stalin knew about this.\n\n20:43.120 --> 20:45.840\n And again, you know, we started with this question\n\n20:45.840 --> 20:47.920\n a little bit earlier, he doesn't,\n\n20:47.920 --> 20:52.920\n there's not a sign of remorse, not a sign of pity, right?\n\n20:54.360 --> 20:58.960\n Not a sign of any kind of human emotion\n\n20:58.960 --> 21:01.680\n that normal people would have.\n\n21:01.680 --> 21:06.680\n What about the opposite of joy for teaching them a lesson?\n\n21:08.280 --> 21:09.560\n I don't think there's joy.\n\n21:09.560 --> 21:12.880\n I'm not sure Stalin really understood\n\n21:12.880 --> 21:15.120\n emotion, what joy was, you know.\n\n21:15.120 --> 21:20.120\n I think he felt it was necessary to get those SOBs, right?\n\n21:21.920 --> 21:23.680\n That they deserved it.\n\n21:23.680 --> 21:26.720\n He says that several times, this is their own fault, right?\n\n21:26.720 --> 21:27.920\n This is their own fault.\n\n21:29.480 --> 21:32.360\n And as their own fault, you know,\n\n21:32.360 --> 21:36.000\n they get what they deserve, basically.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.400\n How much was the calculation?\n\n21:37.400 --> 21:39.920\n How much was it reason versus emotion?\n\n21:39.920 --> 21:44.920\n In terms of, you said he was competent.\n\n21:45.640 --> 21:47.600\n Was there a long term strategy\n\n21:47.600 --> 21:51.520\n or was this strategy based on emotion and anger?\n\n21:51.520 --> 21:56.400\n No, I think actually the right answer is a little of both.\n\n21:56.400 --> 21:58.200\n I mean, usually the right answer in history\n\n21:58.200 --> 21:59.040\n is something like that.\n\n21:59.040 --> 21:59.880\n A little of both?\n\n21:59.880 --> 22:01.360\n No, you can't, you can't.\n\n22:01.360 --> 22:03.920\n It wasn't just, I mean, first of all,\n\n22:03.920 --> 22:08.600\n you know, the Soviets had it in for Ukraine\n\n22:08.600 --> 22:12.080\n and Ukrainian nationalism, which they really didn't like.\n\n22:12.080 --> 22:14.640\n And by the way, Russians still don't like it, right?\n\n22:15.760 --> 22:18.040\n So they had it in for Ukrainian nationalism.\n\n22:18.040 --> 22:20.880\n They feared Ukrainian nationalism.\n\n22:22.280 --> 22:24.760\n As I said, you know, Stalin writes, you know,\n\n22:24.760 --> 22:29.400\n we'll lose Ukraine, you know, if these guys win.\n\n22:29.400 --> 22:33.240\n You know, so there's a kind of long term determination,\n\n22:34.120 --> 22:37.240\n as I said, you know, to kind of break the back\n\n22:37.240 --> 22:42.240\n of Ukrainian national identity and Ukrainian nationalism\n\n22:43.160 --> 22:46.840\n as any kind of separatist force whatsoever.\n\n22:46.840 --> 22:50.040\n And so there's that rational calculation.\n\n22:50.040 --> 22:52.600\n At the same time, I think Stalin is annoyed\n\n22:53.560 --> 22:58.560\n and peeved and angry on one level\n\n22:59.560 --> 23:02.880\n with the Ukrainians for resisting collectivization\n\n23:02.880 --> 23:07.880\n and for being difficult and for not conforming, you know,\n\n23:08.040 --> 23:13.040\n to the way he thinks peasants should act in this situation.\n\n23:13.240 --> 23:14.480\n So you have both things.\n\n23:14.480 --> 23:17.600\n He's also very angry at the Ukrainian party\n\n23:17.600 --> 23:20.160\n and eventually purges it for not being able\n\n23:20.160 --> 23:23.880\n to control Ukraine and not be able to control the situation.\n\n23:23.880 --> 23:26.440\n You know, Ukraine is in theory the bread basket, right?\n\n23:26.440 --> 23:27.280\n Of Europe.\n\n23:27.280 --> 23:30.280\n Well, how come the bread basket isn't turning over to me\n\n23:30.280 --> 23:32.200\n all this grain so I can sell it abroad\n\n23:32.200 --> 23:35.160\n and, you know, build new factories\n\n23:35.160 --> 23:37.520\n and support the workers in the cities?\n\n23:37.520 --> 23:39.600\n So there's a kind of annoyance.\n\n23:39.600 --> 23:41.720\n You know, when things fail,\n\n23:41.720 --> 23:43.720\n and this is absolutely typical of Stalin,\n\n23:43.720 --> 23:45.920\n when things fail, he blames it on other people\n\n23:45.920 --> 23:47.720\n and usually groups of people, right?\n\n23:47.720 --> 23:49.960\n Not individuals, but groups again.\n\n23:50.920 --> 23:53.660\n So a little bit of both I think is the right answer.\n\n23:54.880 --> 23:57.720\n This blame, it feels like there's a playbook\n\n23:57.720 --> 23:59.560\n that dictators follow.\n\n23:59.560 --> 24:01.360\n I just wonder if it comes naturally\n\n24:01.360 --> 24:03.000\n or just kind of evolves.\n\n24:03.960 --> 24:05.680\n Because, you know, blaming others\n\n24:05.680 --> 24:06.960\n and then telling these narratives\n\n24:06.960 --> 24:08.340\n and then creating the other\n\n24:08.340 --> 24:10.700\n and then somehow that leads to hatred and genocide.\n\n24:10.700 --> 24:14.720\n It feels like there's too many commonalities\n\n24:14.720 --> 24:18.960\n for it not to be a naturally emergent strategy\n\n24:18.960 --> 24:20.680\n that works for dictatorships.\n\n24:20.680 --> 24:23.080\n I mean, it's a very good point.\n\n24:23.080 --> 24:27.680\n And I think it's one, you know, that has its merits.\n\n24:27.680 --> 24:30.400\n In other words, I think you're right\n\n24:30.400 --> 24:32.220\n that there's certain kinds of strategies\n\n24:32.220 --> 24:35.540\n by dictators that, you know, are common to them.\n\n24:35.540 --> 24:37.880\n A lot of them do killing, not all of them\n\n24:37.880 --> 24:40.060\n of that sort that Stalin did.\n\n24:40.060 --> 24:43.840\n I've written about Mao and Pol Pot, you know, and Hitler.\n\n24:43.840 --> 24:46.840\n And, you know, there is a sort of, as you say,\n\n24:46.840 --> 24:51.780\n a kind of playbook for political dictatorship.\n\n24:51.780 --> 24:56.540\n Also for, you know, a kind of communist totalitarian way\n\n24:56.540 --> 24:59.080\n of functioning, you know?\n\n24:59.080 --> 25:01.520\n And that way of functioning was described already\n\n25:01.520 --> 25:02.960\n by Hannah Arendt early on\n\n25:02.960 --> 25:05.440\n when she wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism.\n\n25:06.360 --> 25:10.280\n And she more or less writes the playbook\n\n25:10.280 --> 25:12.760\n and Stalin does follow it.\n\n25:12.760 --> 25:17.200\n The real question, it seems to me, is to what extent,\n\n25:17.200 --> 25:19.780\n you know, and how deep does this go\n\n25:19.780 --> 25:22.220\n and how often does it go in that direction?\n\n25:22.220 --> 25:25.040\n I mean, you can argue, for example,\n\n25:25.040 --> 25:27.520\n I mean, Fidel Castro was not a nice man, right?\n\n25:27.520 --> 25:29.860\n He was a dictator, he was a terrible dictator.\n\n25:30.920 --> 25:33.280\n But he did not engage in mass murder.\n\n25:33.280 --> 25:36.760\n Ho Chi Minh was a dictator, a communist dictator\n\n25:36.760 --> 25:39.800\n who grew up, you know, in the communist movement,\n\n25:39.800 --> 25:43.360\n went to Moscow, you know, spent time in Moscow in the 30s\n\n25:43.360 --> 25:47.720\n and went to find, found the Vietnamese Communist Party.\n\n25:47.720 --> 25:49.240\n You know, he was a horrible dictator.\n\n25:49.240 --> 25:50.460\n I'm sure he was responsible\n\n25:50.460 --> 25:52.580\n for a lot of death and destruction.\n\n25:52.580 --> 25:55.120\n But he wasn't a mass murderer.\n\n25:55.120 --> 25:57.920\n And so you get those, you know.\n\n25:57.920 --> 26:02.000\n I mean, I would even argue, others will disagree,\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.120\n that Lenin wasn't a mass murderer.\n\n26:04.120 --> 26:06.660\n You know, that he didn't kill the same way,\n\n26:06.660 --> 26:08.200\n you know, that Stalin killed.\n\n26:08.200 --> 26:10.840\n Or people after him, they're communist dictators too,\n\n26:10.840 --> 26:13.560\n after all, Khrushchev, you know, was a communist dictator.\n\n26:13.560 --> 26:14.960\n But he stopped this killing.\n\n26:16.320 --> 26:19.080\n And, you know, he's still responsible for a gulag\n\n26:19.080 --> 26:22.000\n and people sent off into a gulag and imprisonment\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:23.800\n and torture and that sort of thing.\n\n26:23.800 --> 26:25.400\n But it's not at all the same thing.\n\n26:25.400 --> 26:29.800\n So there are some, you know, like Stalin, like Mao,\n\n26:29.800 --> 26:32.680\n like Pol Pot, you know, who commit these horrible,\n\n26:32.680 --> 26:36.960\n horrible atrocities, extensively engaging,\n\n26:36.960 --> 26:39.800\n in my view, in genocide.\n\n26:39.800 --> 26:42.100\n And there are some who don't.\n\n26:42.100 --> 26:44.680\n And, you know, what's the difference?\n\n26:44.680 --> 26:47.680\n Well, you know, the difference is partly in personality,\n\n26:47.680 --> 26:50.400\n partly in historical circumstance, you know,\n\n26:50.400 --> 26:54.200\n partly in who is it that controls the reins of power.\n\n26:54.200 --> 26:57.040\n How much do you connect the ideas of communism\n\n26:57.040 --> 27:02.040\n or Marxism or socialism to Holodomor, to Stalin's rule?\n\n27:03.080 --> 27:05.640\n So how naturally, as you kind of alluded to,\n\n27:05.640 --> 27:08.480\n does it lead to genocide?\n\n27:09.780 --> 27:13.220\n That's also, I mean, in some ways,\n\n27:13.220 --> 27:14.800\n I've just addressed that question by saying\n\n27:14.800 --> 27:17.100\n it doesn't always lead to genocide.\n\n27:17.100 --> 27:18.980\n You know, in the case, again, you know,\n\n27:18.980 --> 27:23.080\n Cuba is not pretty, but it didn't have,\n\n27:23.080 --> 27:25.040\n there was no genocide in Cuba.\n\n27:25.040 --> 27:26.640\n And same thing in North Vietnam.\n\n27:27.800 --> 27:30.720\n You know, even North Korea, as awful as it is,\n\n27:30.720 --> 27:32.480\n is a terrible dictatorship, right?\n\n27:32.480 --> 27:37.480\n And people's rights are totally destroyed, right?\n\n27:37.560 --> 27:39.880\n They have no freedom whatsoever.\n\n27:39.880 --> 27:43.580\n You know, it's not, as far as we know, genocidal.\n\n27:43.580 --> 27:45.120\n Who knows whether it could be\n\n27:45.120 --> 27:47.000\n or whether if they took over South Korea,\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.080\n you know, mass murder wouldn't take place\n\n27:49.080 --> 27:50.200\n and that kind of thing.\n\n27:50.200 --> 27:53.240\n But my point is, is that the ideology\n\n27:53.240 --> 27:57.120\n doesn't necessarily dictate genocide.\n\n27:57.120 --> 27:59.680\n In other words, it's an ideology, I think,\n\n27:59.680 --> 28:04.200\n that makes genocide sometimes too easily possible\n\n28:05.520 --> 28:09.200\n given, you know, the way it thinks through history\n\n28:09.200 --> 28:11.600\n as being, you know, you're on the right side of history\n\n28:11.600 --> 28:13.800\n and some people are on the wrong side of history\n\n28:13.800 --> 28:15.640\n and you have to destroy those people\n\n28:15.640 --> 28:17.080\n who are on the wrong side of history.\n\n28:17.080 --> 28:21.040\n I mean, there is something in, you know, Marxism, Leninism,\n\n28:21.040 --> 28:23.840\n which, you know, has that kind of language\n\n28:23.840 --> 28:25.520\n and that kind of thinking.\n\n28:25.520 --> 28:30.520\n But I don't think it's necessarily that way.\n\n28:31.500 --> 28:34.140\n There's a wonderful historian at Berkeley\n\n28:34.140 --> 28:37.680\n named Martin Malia who has written, you know,\n\n28:37.680 --> 28:39.640\n wrote a number of books on this subject\n\n28:39.640 --> 28:43.840\n and he was very, very, he was convinced\n\n28:43.840 --> 28:48.840\n that the ideology itself, you know,\n\n28:49.680 --> 28:53.080\n played a crucial role in the murderousness\n\n28:53.080 --> 28:54.660\n of the Soviet regime.\n\n28:54.660 --> 28:56.840\n I'm not completely convinced.\n\n28:56.840 --> 28:58.600\n You know, when I say not completely convinced,\n\n28:58.600 --> 29:01.640\n I think you could argue it different ways.\n\n29:01.640 --> 29:05.680\n Equally valid, you know, with equally valid arguments.\n\n29:05.680 --> 29:10.680\n I mean, there's something about the ideology of communism\n\n29:10.680 --> 29:15.200\n that allows you to decrease the value of human life.\n\n29:15.200 --> 29:17.560\n Almost like this philosophy, if it's okay to crack\n\n29:17.560 --> 29:19.680\n a few eggs to make an omelet.\n\n29:19.680 --> 29:23.040\n So maybe that, if you can reason like that,\n\n29:23.040 --> 29:26.240\n then it's easier to take the leap of,\n\n29:26.240 --> 29:28.460\n for the good of the country, for the good of the people,\n\n29:28.460 --> 29:31.620\n for the good of the world, it's okay to kill a few people.\n\n29:31.620 --> 29:36.620\n And then that's where, I wonder about the slippery slope.\n\n29:37.200 --> 29:38.640\n Yeah, no, no, again, you know,\n\n29:38.640 --> 29:40.240\n I don't think it's a slippery slope.\n\n29:40.240 --> 29:44.080\n I think it's, I think it's dangerous.\n\n29:44.080 --> 29:45.700\n In other words, I think it's dangerous,\n\n29:45.700 --> 29:48.660\n but I don't consider, you know,\n\n29:48.660 --> 29:51.680\n I don't like Marxism, Leninism any better than the next guy.\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:53.520\n And I've lived in plenty of those systems\n\n29:53.520 --> 29:56.640\n to know how they can beat people down\n\n29:56.640 --> 29:59.480\n and how they can, you know,\n\n30:01.340 --> 30:03.280\n destroy human aspirations\n\n30:03.280 --> 30:06.500\n and human interaction between people.\n\n30:06.500 --> 30:11.500\n But they're not necessarily murderous systems.\n\n30:11.840 --> 30:15.600\n They are systems that contain people's autonomy,\n\n30:15.600 --> 30:20.000\n that force people into work and labor and lifestyles\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.820\n that they don't want to live.\n\n30:21.820 --> 30:23.680\n I spent a lot of time, you know,\n\n30:23.680 --> 30:27.620\n with East Germans and Poles, you know,\n\n30:27.620 --> 30:30.900\n who lived in, and even in the Soviet Union,\n\n30:32.120 --> 30:34.200\n you know, in the post Stalin period,\n\n30:34.200 --> 30:37.120\n where people lived lives they didn't want to live,\n\n30:37.120 --> 30:40.660\n you know, and didn't have the freedom to choose.\n\n30:40.660 --> 30:44.040\n And that was terrifying in and of itself,\n\n30:44.040 --> 30:46.560\n but these were not murderous systems.\n\n30:46.560 --> 30:51.480\n And they, you know, ascribed to Marxism, Leninism.\n\n30:51.480 --> 30:54.200\n So I suppose it's important to draw the line\n\n30:54.200 --> 30:58.480\n between mass murder and genocide and mass murder\n\n30:58.480 --> 31:02.680\n versus just mass violation of human rights.\n\n31:02.680 --> 31:04.920\n Right, right.\n\n31:04.920 --> 31:08.780\n And the leap to mass murder, you're saying,\n\n31:10.700 --> 31:13.240\n maybe easier in some ideologies than others,\n\n31:13.240 --> 31:15.960\n but it's not clear that somehow one ideology\n\n31:15.960 --> 31:17.520\n definitely leads to mass murder and not.\n\n31:17.520 --> 31:18.360\n Exactly.\n\n31:18.360 --> 31:21.080\n I wonder how many factors, what factors,\n\n31:21.080 --> 31:24.000\n how much of it is a single charismatic leader?\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:28.000\n How much of it is the conflagration\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.640\n of multiple historical events?\n\n31:30.640 --> 31:35.060\n How much of it is just dumb, the opposite of luck?\n\n31:38.240 --> 31:40.680\n Do you have a sense where if you look at a moment\n\n31:40.680 --> 31:45.680\n in history, predict, looking at the factors,\n\n31:46.840 --> 31:49.520\n whether something bad's going to happen here?\n\n31:49.520 --> 31:52.440\n When you look at Iraq at when Saddam Hussein\n\n31:52.440 --> 31:55.840\n first took power, well, you could,\n\n31:55.840 --> 31:58.680\n or you can, you know, go even farther back in history,\n\n31:58.680 --> 32:00.240\n would you be able to predict?\n\n32:00.240 --> 32:02.200\n So you said, you already kind of answered that\n\n32:02.200 --> 32:04.640\n with Stalin saying there's no way you could have predicted\n\n32:04.640 --> 32:07.000\n that in the early 20s.\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\n Is that always the case?\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.280\n You basically can't predict.\n\n32:09.280 --> 32:11.080\n It's pretty much always the case.\n\n32:11.080 --> 32:14.960\n In other words, I mean, history is a wonderful,\n\n32:14.960 --> 32:17.480\n you know, discipline and way of looking at life\n\n32:17.480 --> 32:21.880\n and the world in retrospect, meaning it happened.\n\n32:21.880 --> 32:23.040\n It happened.\n\n32:23.040 --> 32:24.960\n And we know it happened.\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:28.600\n And it's too easy to say sometimes it happened\n\n32:28.600 --> 32:30.720\n because it had to happen that way.\n\n32:30.720 --> 32:33.840\n It almost never has to happen that way.\n\n32:33.840 --> 32:35.580\n And, you know, things.\n\n32:36.760 --> 32:41.760\n So I very much am of the school that emphasizes,\n\n32:43.560 --> 32:48.020\n you know, contingency and choice and difference\n\n32:48.020 --> 32:50.480\n and different paths and not, you know,\n\n32:50.480 --> 32:54.940\n not necessarily a path that has to be followed.\n\n32:54.940 --> 32:59.900\n And those, you know, and, you know,\n\n32:59.900 --> 33:02.900\n sometimes you can warn about things.\n\n33:02.900 --> 33:06.100\n I mean, you can think, well, something's going to happen.\n\n33:06.100 --> 33:08.420\n And usually the way it works,\n\n33:08.420 --> 33:09.620\n let me just give you one example.\n\n33:09.620 --> 33:11.580\n I mean, I'm thinking about an example right now,\n\n33:11.580 --> 33:13.280\n which was the war in Yugoslavia, you know,\n\n33:13.280 --> 33:16.180\n which came in the 1990s and eventually\n\n33:16.180 --> 33:18.400\n ventuated in genocide in Bosnia.\n\n33:19.780 --> 33:23.180\n And, you know, I remember very clearly, you know,\n\n33:23.180 --> 33:25.780\n the 1970s and 1980s in Yugoslavia,\n\n33:25.780 --> 33:28.260\n and people would say, you know, there's trouble here\n\n33:28.260 --> 33:31.260\n and, you know, something could go wrong.\n\n33:31.260 --> 33:33.900\n But no one in their wildest imagination\n\n33:33.900 --> 33:36.860\n thought that there would be outright war between them all.\n\n33:36.860 --> 33:39.300\n Then the outright war happened, genocide happened,\n\n33:39.300 --> 33:41.940\n and afterwards people would say, I saw it coming.\n\n33:42.860 --> 33:44.580\n You know, so you get a lot of that,\n\n33:45.700 --> 33:48.820\n especially with pundits and journalists,\n\n33:48.820 --> 33:51.040\n and that's, I saw it coming, I knew it was happening.\n\n33:51.040 --> 33:53.620\n You know, well, I mean, what happens in the human mind,\n\n33:53.620 --> 33:54.980\n and it happens in your mind too,\n\n33:54.980 --> 33:58.180\n is, you know, you go through a lot of alternatives.\n\n33:58.180 --> 34:00.460\n I mean, think about January 6th, you know, in this country,\n\n34:00.460 --> 34:02.140\n and all the different alternatives\n\n34:03.300 --> 34:05.020\n which people had in their mind,\n\n34:05.020 --> 34:10.020\n or before January 6th, you know, after the lost election.\n\n34:10.480 --> 34:13.180\n You know, things could have gone in lots of different ways,\n\n34:13.180 --> 34:14.580\n and there were all kinds of people\n\n34:14.580 --> 34:16.300\n choosing different ways it could have gone,\n\n34:16.300 --> 34:20.020\n but nobody really knew how it was going to turn out.\n\n34:20.020 --> 34:22.020\n It wasn't as smart people really understood\n\n34:22.020 --> 34:24.260\n that there'd be this kind of cockamamie uprising\n\n34:24.260 --> 34:26.980\n on January 6th, you know, that almost,\n\n34:26.980 --> 34:28.980\n you know, caused us enormous grief.\n\n34:28.980 --> 34:31.640\n So all of these kinds of things in history,\n\n34:31.640 --> 34:33.620\n you know, are deeply contingent.\n\n34:33.620 --> 34:37.320\n They depend on, you know, factors that we cannot predict,\n\n34:37.320 --> 34:41.380\n and, you know, and it's the joy of history that it's open.\n\n34:41.380 --> 34:43.500\n You know, you think about how people are now,\n\n34:43.500 --> 34:45.020\n I mean, let me give you one more example,\n\n34:45.020 --> 34:47.460\n and then I'll shut up, but, you know,\n\n34:47.460 --> 34:49.700\n there's the environmental example.\n\n34:49.700 --> 34:51.020\n You know, we're all threatened, right?\n\n34:51.020 --> 34:51.940\n We know it's coming.\n\n34:51.940 --> 34:54.440\n We know there's trouble, right?\n\n34:54.440 --> 34:58.260\n We know there's gonna be a catastrophe at some point,\n\n34:58.260 --> 34:59.260\n but when?\n\n34:59.260 --> 35:00.980\n What's the catastrophe?\n\n35:00.980 --> 35:02.380\n Yeah, what's the nature of the catastrophe?\n\n35:02.380 --> 35:03.220\n Everyone says catastrophe.\n\n35:03.220 --> 35:04.060\n And what's the nature of it, right, right, right.\n\n35:04.060 --> 35:06.380\n Is it gonna be wars because resource constraint?\n\n35:06.380 --> 35:07.400\n Is it going to be hunger?\n\n35:07.400 --> 35:10.780\n Is it gonna be, like, mass migration of different kinds\n\n35:10.780 --> 35:13.260\n that leads to some kind of conflict and immigration,\n\n35:13.260 --> 35:16.320\n and maybe it won't be that big of a deal,\n\n35:16.320 --> 35:19.020\n and a total other catastrophic event\n\n35:19.020 --> 35:21.180\n will completely challenge the entirety\n\n35:21.180 --> 35:22.220\n of the human civilization.\n\n35:22.220 --> 35:25.120\n That's my point, that's my point, that's my point.\n\n35:25.980 --> 35:28.100\n You know, we really don't know.\n\n35:28.100 --> 35:29.700\n I mean, there's a lot we do know.\n\n35:29.700 --> 35:32.060\n I mean, the warming business and all this kind of stuff,\n\n35:32.060 --> 35:34.260\n you know, it's scientifically there,\n\n35:34.260 --> 35:36.540\n but how it's going to play out.\n\n35:36.540 --> 35:39.700\n And everybody's saying, you know, different things.\n\n35:39.700 --> 35:42.980\n And then you get somewhere in 50 years or 60 years,\n\n35:42.980 --> 35:45.500\n which I won't see, and people say, aha,\n\n35:45.500 --> 35:47.060\n I told you it was gonna be X,\n\n35:47.060 --> 35:49.420\n or it was gonna be Y, or it was gonna be Z.\n\n35:49.420 --> 35:52.100\n So I just don't think in history you can,\n\n35:54.620 --> 35:56.360\n well, you can't predict.\n\n35:56.360 --> 35:59.020\n You simply cannot predict what's going to happen.\n\n35:59.020 --> 36:02.260\n It's kind of when you just look at Hitler in the 30s,\n\n36:02.260 --> 36:07.140\n for me, oftentimes when I kind of read different accounts,\n\n36:07.140 --> 36:09.100\n it is so often, certainly in the press,\n\n36:09.100 --> 36:11.880\n but in general, me just reading about Hitler,\n\n36:11.880 --> 36:15.020\n I get the sense, like, this is a clown.\n\n36:15.020 --> 36:18.420\n There's no way this person will gain power.\n\n36:18.420 --> 36:20.260\n Which one, Hitler or Stalin?\n\n36:20.260 --> 36:21.420\n Hitler, Hitler.\n\n36:21.420 --> 36:23.260\n No, no, no, with Stalin, you don't get a sense\n\n36:23.260 --> 36:26.060\n he's a clown, he's a really good executive.\n\n36:26.060 --> 36:28.540\n You think, you don't think it'll lead to mass murder,\n\n36:28.540 --> 36:32.460\n but you think he's going to build a giant bureaucracy,\n\n36:32.460 --> 36:37.260\n at least with Hitler, it's like a failed artist\n\n36:37.260 --> 36:39.500\n who keeps screaming about stuff.\n\n36:39.500 --> 36:42.380\n There's no way he's gonna, I mean,\n\n36:42.380 --> 36:44.820\n you certainly don't think about the atrocities,\n\n36:44.820 --> 36:47.580\n but there's no way he's going to gain power,\n\n36:47.580 --> 36:48.860\n especially against communism.\n\n36:48.860 --> 36:50.620\n There's so many other competing forces\n\n36:50.620 --> 36:54.220\n that could have easily beat him.\n\n36:54.220 --> 36:58.900\n But then, you realize, event after event,\n\n36:58.900 --> 37:00.380\n where this clown keeps dancing,\n\n37:00.380 --> 37:02.900\n and all of a sudden, he gains more and more power,\n\n37:02.900 --> 37:04.940\n and just certain moments in time,\n\n37:04.940 --> 37:09.940\n he makes strategic decisions in terms of cooperating\n\n37:11.500 --> 37:13.180\n or gaining power over the military,\n\n37:13.180 --> 37:16.300\n all those kinds of things that eventually\n\n37:16.300 --> 37:17.300\n give him the power.\n\n37:17.300 --> 37:21.500\n I mean, this clown is one of the most impactful\n\n37:21.500 --> 37:25.260\n in the negative sense human beings in history.\n\n37:25.260 --> 37:27.980\n Right, and even the Jews who are there\n\n37:27.980 --> 37:30.580\n and are being screamed at and discriminated against,\n\n37:30.580 --> 37:33.860\n and there's a series of measures taken against them\n\n37:33.860 --> 37:36.460\n incrementally during the course of the 1930s,\n\n37:37.420 --> 37:39.020\n and very few who leave.\n\n37:39.020 --> 37:40.660\n Yeah, I mean, some pick up and go and say,\n\n37:40.660 --> 37:44.580\n I'm getting the hell out of here, and some Zionists\n\n37:44.580 --> 37:46.820\n try to leave, too, and go to the United States and stuff,\n\n37:46.820 --> 37:51.620\n but go to Israel and Palestine at the time,\n\n37:51.620 --> 37:55.540\n but, or to Britain or France.\n\n37:55.540 --> 37:59.020\n But in general, even the Jews who should have been\n\n37:59.020 --> 38:01.460\n very sensitive to what was going on\n\n38:01.460 --> 38:06.100\n didn't really understand the extent of the danger,\n\n38:06.100 --> 38:08.740\n and it's really hard for people to do that.\n\n38:08.740 --> 38:12.060\n It's almost impossible, in fact, I think.\n\n38:12.060 --> 38:15.060\n So most of the time, in that exact situation,\n\n38:16.860 --> 38:18.340\n nothing would have happened,\n\n38:18.340 --> 38:20.220\n or there'd be some drama and so on,\n\n38:20.220 --> 38:22.240\n and it'd be there's some bureaucrat,\n\n38:22.240 --> 38:23.860\n but every once in a while in human history,\n\n38:23.860 --> 38:25.900\n there's a kind of turn,\n\n38:25.900 --> 38:28.740\n and maybe something catalyzes something else,\n\n38:28.740 --> 38:31.060\n and just it accelerates to accelerate,\n\n38:31.060 --> 38:34.060\n escalates, escalates, and then war breaks out,\n\n38:34.060 --> 38:37.820\n or totally, you know, revolutions break out.\n\n38:37.820 --> 38:38.660\n Right.\n\n38:40.180 --> 38:43.580\n Can we go to the big question of genocide?\n\n38:43.580 --> 38:44.860\n What is genocide?\n\n38:44.860 --> 38:47.460\n What are the defining characteristics of genocide?\n\n38:48.380 --> 38:50.580\n Dealing with genocide is a difficult thing\n\n38:50.580 --> 38:52.320\n when it comes to the definition.\n\n38:53.540 --> 38:58.540\n There is a definition, the December 1948 UN Convention\n\n38:58.540 --> 39:02.220\n on the Prep Prevention and Punishment of Genocide\n\n39:02.220 --> 39:07.220\n is considered the sort of major document of definition,\n\n39:07.220 --> 39:09.700\n in the definitional sense of genocide,\n\n39:09.700 --> 39:14.700\n and it emphasizes the intentional destruction\n\n39:16.460 --> 39:21.460\n of an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group,\n\n39:22.100 --> 39:26.660\n those are the four groups, again, comma, as such.\n\n39:26.660 --> 39:27.900\n And what that means, basically,\n\n39:27.900 --> 39:31.900\n is destroying the group as a group.\n\n39:31.900 --> 39:36.700\n In other words, there's a kind of beauty in human diversity,\n\n39:36.700 --> 39:39.580\n and different groups of people, you know,\n\n39:39.580 --> 39:43.500\n Estonians, you know, a tribe of Native Americans,\n\n39:43.500 --> 39:48.500\n South African tribes, you know, the Rohingya in Myanmar,\n\n39:48.880 --> 39:52.180\n there's a kind of beauty humanity recognizes\n\n39:52.180 --> 39:55.360\n in the distinctiveness of those groups.\n\n39:55.360 --> 39:58.060\n You know, this was a notion that emerges really\n\n39:58.060 --> 40:00.920\n with Romanticism after the French Revolution,\n\n40:00.920 --> 40:03.280\n then the beginning of the 19th century,\n\n40:03.280 --> 40:04.500\n with Herder, mostly.\n\n40:04.500 --> 40:07.000\n And this beauty of these groups, then,\n\n40:08.260 --> 40:12.540\n you know, is what is under attack in genocide.\n\n40:13.840 --> 40:16.100\n And it's with intent, you know,\n\n40:16.100 --> 40:19.840\n the idea is that it's intentional destruction.\n\n40:19.840 --> 40:23.180\n So this is a kind of, you know,\n\n40:23.180 --> 40:25.860\n analogy to first degree, second degree,\n\n40:25.860 --> 40:27.100\n and third degree murder, right?\n\n40:27.100 --> 40:28.280\n First degree murder, you know,\n\n40:28.280 --> 40:31.220\n you're out to kill this person, and you plan it,\n\n40:31.220 --> 40:34.180\n and you go out, and you do it, right?\n\n40:34.180 --> 40:36.100\n That's intent, right?\n\n40:36.100 --> 40:37.780\n Manslaughter is not intent.\n\n40:37.780 --> 40:40.980\n You end up doing the same thing, but it's different.\n\n40:40.980 --> 40:45.980\n So, you know, the major person behind the definitions,\n\n40:46.700 --> 40:49.620\n a man named Raphael Lemkin, I don't know if you heard\n\n40:49.620 --> 40:53.540\n his name or not, but he was a Polish Jewish jurist\n\n40:53.540 --> 40:55.980\n who came, you know, from Poland,\n\n40:55.980 --> 40:58.340\n came to the United States during the war,\n\n40:58.340 --> 41:03.340\n and had been a kind of crusader for recognizing genocide.\n\n41:05.780 --> 41:08.620\n It's a word that he created, by the way,\n\n41:08.620 --> 41:11.300\n and he coined the term in 1943,\n\n41:11.300 --> 41:14.940\n and then published it in 1944 for the first time.\n\n41:14.940 --> 41:18.060\n Geno, meaning people, and side, meaning killing, right?\n\n41:18.060 --> 41:20.900\n And so Lemkin then had this term,\n\n41:20.900 --> 41:23.420\n and he pushed hard to have it recognized,\n\n41:23.420 --> 41:24.940\n and it was in the UN Convention.\n\n41:24.940 --> 41:27.340\n So that's the rough definition.\n\n41:27.340 --> 41:30.500\n The problem with it is the definition,\n\n41:30.500 --> 41:33.020\n the problems with the definition are several.\n\n41:33.940 --> 41:38.460\n You know, one of them is, is it just these four groups?\n\n41:38.460 --> 41:42.340\n You know, racial, religious, ethnic, or national?\n\n41:42.340 --> 41:44.620\n See, this comes right out of the war.\n\n41:44.620 --> 41:48.740\n And what's in people's minds in 1948 are Jews,\n\n41:48.740 --> 41:51.740\n Poles, Russians, Yugoslavs sometimes,\n\n41:51.740 --> 41:53.060\n who were killed by the Nazis.\n\n41:53.060 --> 41:54.580\n That's what's in their mind.\n\n41:54.580 --> 41:56.980\n But there are other groups, too, if you think about it,\n\n41:56.980 --> 41:58.900\n you know, who are killed,\n\n41:58.900 --> 42:01.380\n social groups or political groups.\n\n42:01.380 --> 42:05.220\n And that was not allowed in the convention,\n\n42:05.220 --> 42:07.900\n meaning for a lot of different reasons,\n\n42:07.900 --> 42:10.740\n the Soviets were primary among them.\n\n42:10.740 --> 42:12.820\n They didn't want other kinds of groups,\n\n42:12.820 --> 42:16.620\n let's say Kulaks, for example, to be considered.\n\n42:16.620 --> 42:18.620\n That's a social group.\n\n42:18.620 --> 42:21.500\n Or peasants, which is a social group.\n\n42:21.500 --> 42:23.140\n So, or a political group.\n\n42:23.140 --> 42:28.140\n I mean, let's take a group, you know, communists killed\n\n42:28.580 --> 42:31.900\n groups of people, but non communists also killed\n\n42:31.900 --> 42:35.780\n groups of people in Indonesia in 1965, 66, they killed,\n\n42:35.780 --> 42:37.100\n you know, I don't know exactly,\n\n42:37.100 --> 42:40.100\n but roughly 600,000 Indonesian communists.\n\n42:40.100 --> 42:42.500\n Well, is that genocide or not?\n\n42:42.500 --> 42:45.260\n You know, at my point of view, it is genocide,\n\n42:45.260 --> 42:48.460\n although it's Indonesians killing Indonesians.\n\n42:48.460 --> 42:51.060\n And we have the same problem with the Cambodian genocide.\n\n42:51.060 --> 42:53.860\n I mean, we talk about a Cambodian genocide,\n\n42:53.860 --> 42:56.940\n but most of the people killed in the Cambodian genocide\n\n42:56.940 --> 42:58.620\n were other Cambodians.\n\n42:58.620 --> 43:01.140\n They give it the name, they're ready to recognize\n\n43:01.140 --> 43:04.340\n this genocide because they also killed some other peoples,\n\n43:04.340 --> 43:08.060\n meaning the Vietnamese, Aham people who are,\n\n43:08.060 --> 43:13.060\n you know, Muslim, smaller Muslim people in the area,\n\n43:13.300 --> 43:14.700\n and a few others.\n\n43:14.700 --> 43:18.100\n So the question then becomes, well,\n\n43:18.100 --> 43:20.300\n does it have to be a different nationality\n\n43:20.300 --> 43:23.140\n or ethnic group or religious group for it to be genocide?\n\n43:23.140 --> 43:24.780\n And my answer is no.\n\n43:24.780 --> 43:26.460\n You know, you need to expand the definition.\n\n43:26.460 --> 43:28.100\n It's a little bit like with our constitution.\n\n43:28.100 --> 43:30.460\n We got a constitution, but we don't live\n\n43:30.460 --> 43:32.060\n in the end of the 18th century, right?\n\n43:32.060 --> 43:33.660\n We live in the 21st century.\n\n43:33.660 --> 43:36.660\n And so you have to update the constitution\n\n43:36.660 --> 43:38.340\n over the centuries.\n\n43:38.340 --> 43:42.700\n And similarly, the genocide convention needs updating too.\n\n43:42.700 --> 43:45.140\n So that's how I work with the definition.\n\n43:45.140 --> 43:48.060\n So this is this invention.\n\n43:48.060 --> 43:51.060\n Was it an invention, this beautiful idea,\n\n43:51.060 --> 43:53.540\n romantic idea that there's groups of people\n\n43:53.540 --> 43:57.660\n and the group is united by some unique characteristics?\n\n43:57.660 --> 44:01.620\n That was an invention in human history, this idea?\n\n44:01.620 --> 44:03.460\n Not to see as individuals?\n\n44:03.460 --> 44:05.180\n In some senses, it was.\n\n44:05.180 --> 44:06.740\n I mean, it's not, you know,\n\n44:06.740 --> 44:09.380\n there are things that are always constructed\n\n44:09.380 --> 44:12.940\n in one fashion or another and the construction,\n\n44:12.940 --> 44:15.860\n you know, more or less represents the reality.\n\n44:15.860 --> 44:18.540\n And what the reality is always much more complicated\n\n44:18.540 --> 44:21.940\n than the construction or the invention of a term\n\n44:21.940 --> 44:26.420\n or a concept or a way of thinking about a nation, right?\n\n44:26.420 --> 44:29.740\n And this way of thinking of nations, you know,\n\n44:29.740 --> 44:34.740\n as again, you know, groups of religious, linguistic,\n\n44:37.900 --> 44:42.300\n not political necessarily, but cultural entities\n\n44:42.300 --> 44:45.500\n is something that was essentially invented, yes.\n\n44:45.500 --> 44:47.460\n Yeah, so I mean, you know, if you look at...\n\n44:47.460 --> 44:50.380\n There are no Germans in the 17th century.\n\n44:50.380 --> 44:52.740\n There are no Italians in the 17th century, right?\n\n44:52.740 --> 44:54.860\n They're only there after, you know,\n\n44:54.860 --> 44:59.380\n the invention of the nation, which comes again,\n\n44:59.380 --> 45:01.900\n mostly out of the French Revolution\n\n45:01.900 --> 45:03.700\n and in the Romantic movement,\n\n45:03.700 --> 45:08.420\n a man named Johann Gottfried von Herder, right?\n\n45:08.420 --> 45:11.420\n Who was really the first one who sort of went around,\n\n45:11.420 --> 45:14.700\n collected people's languages and collected their sayings\n\n45:14.700 --> 45:16.980\n and their dances and their folkways and stuff\n\n45:16.980 --> 45:19.460\n and said, isn't this cool, you know,\n\n45:19.460 --> 45:21.780\n that they're Estonians and that they're Latvians\n\n45:21.780 --> 45:23.140\n and that they're these other,\n\n45:23.140 --> 45:25.900\n these interesting different peoples\n\n45:25.900 --> 45:28.420\n who don't even know necessarily\n\n45:28.420 --> 45:30.620\n that they're different peoples, right?\n\n45:30.620 --> 45:33.140\n That comes a little bit later, right?\n\n45:33.140 --> 45:36.060\n Once the concept is invented, then people start to say,\n\n45:36.060 --> 45:39.020\n hey, we're nations too, you know?\n\n45:39.020 --> 45:41.820\n And the Germans decide they're a nation and they unify.\n\n45:41.820 --> 45:43.900\n And the Italians discover they're a nation\n\n45:43.900 --> 45:46.260\n and they unify instead of being, you know,\n\n45:46.260 --> 45:51.100\n Florentines and Romans and, you know, Sicilians.\n\n45:52.100 --> 45:55.340\n But then beyond nations, there's political affiliations,\n\n45:55.340 --> 45:56.180\n all those kinds of things.\n\n45:56.180 --> 45:59.500\n It's fascinating that, you know, you start,\n\n45:59.500 --> 46:01.580\n look at the early Homo sapiens\n\n46:01.580 --> 46:04.220\n and then there's obviously tribes, right?\n\n46:04.220 --> 46:06.660\n And then that's very concrete.\n\n46:06.660 --> 46:09.500\n That's a geographic location and it's a small group\n\n46:09.500 --> 46:12.940\n of people and you have warring tribes probably connected\n\n46:12.940 --> 46:16.180\n to just limited resources.\n\n46:16.180 --> 46:18.620\n But it's fascinating to think that that is then taken\n\n46:18.620 --> 46:22.900\n to the space of ideas, to where you can create a group\n\n46:22.900 --> 46:27.020\n at first to appreciate its beauty.\n\n46:27.020 --> 46:30.020\n You create a group based on language,\n\n46:30.020 --> 46:34.340\n based on maybe even political, philosophical ideas,\n\n46:34.340 --> 46:36.380\n religious ideas, all those kinds of things.\n\n46:36.380 --> 46:38.580\n And then that naturally then leads\n\n46:38.580 --> 46:42.860\n to getting angry at groups and making them the other.\n\n46:42.860 --> 46:43.900\n And then hatred.\n\n46:43.900 --> 46:44.740\n Right.\n\n46:44.740 --> 46:47.660\n That comes more towards the end of the 19th century,\n\n46:47.660 --> 46:50.100\n you know, with the influence of Darwin.\n\n46:50.100 --> 46:51.940\n I mean, you can't blame Darwin for it,\n\n46:51.940 --> 46:54.300\n but neo Darwin, Darwinians, you know,\n\n46:54.300 --> 46:55.860\n who start to talk about, you know,\n\n46:55.860 --> 46:59.340\n the competition between nations, the natural competition,\n\n46:59.340 --> 47:03.220\n the weak ones fall away, the strong ones get ahead.\n\n47:03.220 --> 47:05.500\n You know, you get this sort of combination also\n\n47:05.500 --> 47:08.460\n with, you know, modern antisemitism\n\n47:08.460 --> 47:09.980\n and with racial thinking, you know,\n\n47:09.980 --> 47:12.420\n the racial thinking at the end of the 19th century\n\n47:12.420 --> 47:14.060\n is very powerful.\n\n47:14.060 --> 47:16.860\n So now, you know, at the end of the 19th century\n\n47:16.860 --> 47:19.780\n versus the beginning of the, you know,\n\n47:19.780 --> 47:22.580\n the middle of the 19th century, you know,\n\n47:22.580 --> 47:24.020\n you can be a German and be a Jew\n\n47:24.020 --> 47:26.220\n and there's no contradiction.\n\n47:26.220 --> 47:27.060\n Yeah.\n\n47:27.060 --> 47:28.860\n As long as you speak the language and you, you know,\n\n47:28.860 --> 47:32.420\n you dress and think and act and share the culture.\n\n47:32.420 --> 47:35.340\n By the end of the 19th century, people saying, no, no,\n\n47:35.340 --> 47:37.100\n you know, they're not Germans.\n\n47:37.100 --> 47:37.940\n They're Jews, they're different.\n\n47:37.940 --> 47:38.780\n They have different blood.\n\n47:38.780 --> 47:40.580\n They have different, they don't say genes yet,\n\n47:40.580 --> 47:43.740\n but you know, that's sort of a sense of people.\n\n47:43.740 --> 47:45.420\n And that's when, you know,\n\n47:45.420 --> 47:49.220\n there's this sense of superiority too, and inferiority.\n\n47:49.220 --> 47:50.060\n Yeah.\n\n47:50.060 --> 47:51.700\n You know, that they're inferior to us.\n\n47:51.700 --> 47:52.540\n Yeah.\n\n47:52.540 --> 47:55.380\n You know, and that we're the strong ones\n\n47:55.380 --> 47:57.460\n and we have to, you know, and Hitler, by the way,\n\n47:57.460 --> 48:00.260\n just adopts this hook line and sinker.\n\n48:00.260 --> 48:03.020\n I mean, there are a whole series of thinkers\n\n48:03.020 --> 48:05.100\n at the end of the 19th and beginning of 20th century\n\n48:05.100 --> 48:06.900\n who he cites in Mein Kampf, you know,\n\n48:06.900 --> 48:09.300\n which is written in the early 1920s,\n\n48:09.300 --> 48:14.300\n that, you know, basically pervades this racial thinking.\n\n48:15.180 --> 48:16.780\n So nationalism changes.\n\n48:16.780 --> 48:19.860\n So nationalism in and of itself is not bad.\n\n48:19.860 --> 48:21.220\n I mean, it's not bad, you know,\n\n48:21.220 --> 48:25.220\n to share culture and language and, you know,\n\n48:25.220 --> 48:29.980\n folkways and a sense of common belonging.\n\n48:29.980 --> 48:32.780\n There's nothing bad about it inherently.\n\n48:32.780 --> 48:35.540\n But then what happens is it becomes, you know,\n\n48:35.540 --> 48:39.620\n frequently is used and becomes, especially on fascism,\n\n48:39.620 --> 48:42.380\n becomes dangerous.\n\n48:42.380 --> 48:44.580\n And it's especially dangerous\n\n48:44.580 --> 48:48.980\n when the two conflicting groups share geographic location.\n\n48:48.980 --> 48:49.820\n That's right.\n\n48:49.820 --> 48:54.260\n So like with Jews, you know, I come, you know,\n\n48:54.260 --> 48:58.780\n I'm a Russian Jew and it's always interesting.\n\n48:58.780 --> 49:05.780\n I take pride in, you know, I love the tradition\n\n49:05.900 --> 49:07.500\n of the Soviet Union, of Russia.\n\n49:07.500 --> 49:08.540\n I love America.\n\n49:08.540 --> 49:10.100\n So I love these countries.\n\n49:10.100 --> 49:13.340\n They have beautiful tradition in literature and science\n\n49:13.340 --> 49:15.380\n and art and all those kinds of things.\n\n49:15.380 --> 49:19.220\n But it's funny that people, not often,\n\n49:19.220 --> 49:24.060\n but sometimes correct me that I'm not Russian.\n\n49:24.060 --> 49:24.900\n I'm a Jew.\n\n49:24.900 --> 49:29.980\n And it's a, it's a, it's a nice reminder.\n\n49:29.980 --> 49:30.980\n Yes.\n\n49:30.980 --> 49:34.220\n That that is always there,\n\n49:34.220 --> 49:37.260\n that desire to create these groups.\n\n49:37.260 --> 49:39.780\n And then when they're living in the same place\n\n49:39.780 --> 49:42.100\n for that division between groups,\n\n49:42.100 --> 49:45.020\n that hate between groups can explode.\n\n49:45.940 --> 49:49.540\n And I just, I wonder why is that there?\n\n49:49.540 --> 49:53.420\n Why does, why does the human heart tend so easily\n\n49:53.420 --> 49:55.540\n towards this kind of hate?\n\n49:58.420 --> 50:02.580\n You know, that's a big question in and of itself.\n\n50:02.580 --> 50:04.820\n You know, the human heart is full of everything, right?\n\n50:04.820 --> 50:05.740\n It's full of hate.\n\n50:05.740 --> 50:06.660\n It's full of love.\n\n50:06.660 --> 50:07.820\n It's full of indifference.\n\n50:07.820 --> 50:09.700\n It's full of apathy.\n\n50:09.700 --> 50:10.700\n It's full of energy.\n\n50:10.700 --> 50:14.940\n So, I mean, hate is something, you know, that,\n\n50:17.660 --> 50:22.460\n I mean, I think, and, you know,\n\n50:22.460 --> 50:25.300\n along with hate, you know, the ability to really hurt\n\n50:25.300 --> 50:28.260\n and injure people is something that's within all of us.\n\n50:28.260 --> 50:30.340\n You know, it's within all of us.\n\n50:30.340 --> 50:33.420\n And it's just something that's part of who we are\n\n50:35.140 --> 50:37.860\n and part of our society.\n\n50:37.860 --> 50:39.980\n So, you know, we're shaped by our society\n\n50:39.980 --> 50:43.380\n and our society can do with us often what it wishes.\n\n50:44.740 --> 50:47.660\n You know, that's why it's so much nicer to live in a\n\n50:47.660 --> 50:49.780\n more or less beneficent society\n\n50:49.780 --> 50:52.500\n like that of a democracy in the West\n\n50:52.500 --> 50:55.060\n than to live in the Soviet Union, right?\n\n50:55.060 --> 50:59.020\n I mean, because, you know, you have more or less\n\n50:59.020 --> 51:01.740\n the freedom to do what you wish\n\n51:01.740 --> 51:04.380\n and not to be forced into situations\n\n51:04.380 --> 51:08.580\n in which you would have to then do nasty to other people.\n\n51:09.620 --> 51:12.460\n You know, some societies, as we talked about,\n\n51:12.460 --> 51:16.700\n you know, are more have proclivities towards,\n\n51:16.700 --> 51:19.940\n you know, asking of its people to do things\n\n51:19.940 --> 51:24.380\n they don't want to do and forcing them to do so.\n\n51:24.380 --> 51:27.820\n So, you know, freedom is a wonderful thing.\n\n51:27.820 --> 51:30.860\n To be able to choose not to do evil is a great thing,\n\n51:30.860 --> 51:33.900\n you know, whereas in some societies, you know,\n\n51:33.900 --> 51:38.900\n you feel in some ways for not so much for the NKVD bosses,\n\n51:39.060 --> 51:41.900\n but for the guys on the ground, you know, in the 1930s\n\n51:41.900 --> 51:44.820\n or not so much for the Nazi bosses,\n\n51:44.820 --> 51:49.100\n but for the guys, you know, in the police battalion\n\n51:50.340 --> 51:53.740\n that were told, go shoot those Jews, you know?\n\n51:53.740 --> 51:57.540\n And you do it, not necessarily because\n\n51:57.540 --> 52:02.060\n they force you to do it, but because your social,\n\n52:02.060 --> 52:07.060\n you know, your social situation, you know, encourages you to\n\n52:07.580 --> 52:09.940\n and you don't have the courage not to.\n\n52:09.940 --> 52:12.500\n Yeah, I was just, as I often do,\n\n52:12.500 --> 52:15.940\n rereading Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning\n\n52:15.940 --> 52:20.940\n and he said something, I just, I often pull out sort of lines.\n\n52:22.420 --> 52:25.180\n The mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard\n\n52:25.180 --> 52:28.340\n or a prisoner tells us almost nothing.\n\n52:28.340 --> 52:31.180\n Human kindness can be found in all groups,\n\n52:31.180 --> 52:36.180\n even those which as a whole, it would be easy to condemn.\n\n52:36.220 --> 52:41.220\n So that's speaking to, you feel for those people\n\n52:41.220 --> 52:46.220\n at the lowest level implementing the orders of those above.\n\n52:49.780 --> 52:50.620\n Right.\n\n52:51.740 --> 52:54.700\n And also you worry yourself what will happen\n\n52:54.700 --> 52:56.740\n if you were given those same orders, you know?\n\n52:56.740 --> 52:59.020\n I mean, what would you do?\n\n52:59.020 --> 53:01.700\n You know, what kind of reaction would you have\n\n53:01.700 --> 53:03.380\n in a similar situation?\n\n53:03.380 --> 53:05.860\n And you know, you don't know.\n\n53:07.740 --> 53:10.340\n I could see myself in World War II\n\n53:10.340 --> 53:15.340\n while fighting for almost any country that I was born in.\n\n53:17.140 --> 53:20.260\n There's a love of community, there's a love of country\n\n53:20.260 --> 53:23.180\n that's just, at least to me it comes naturally,\n\n53:23.180 --> 53:27.260\n just love of community and countries wanting such community.\n\n53:27.260 --> 53:29.460\n And I could see fighting for that country,\n\n53:29.460 --> 53:33.660\n especially when you're sold a story that you're fighting evil\n\n53:33.660 --> 53:35.300\n and I'm sure every single country\n\n53:35.300 --> 53:38.540\n was sold that story effectively.\n\n53:38.540 --> 53:41.300\n And then when you're in the military\n\n53:41.300 --> 53:42.420\n and you have a gun in your hand\n\n53:42.420 --> 53:47.420\n or you're in the police force and you're ordered,\n\n53:47.660 --> 53:52.660\n go to this place and commit violence,\n\n53:53.100 --> 53:55.420\n it's hard to know what you would do.\n\n53:55.420 --> 53:57.540\n It's a mix of fear, it's a mix of,\n\n53:59.020 --> 54:01.020\n maybe you convince yourself, you know,\n\n54:01.020 --> 54:03.540\n what can one person really do?\n\n54:03.540 --> 54:05.900\n And over time, it's again, that slippery slope.\n\n54:05.900 --> 54:09.020\n Because you could see all the people who protest,\n\n54:09.020 --> 54:12.620\n who revolt, they're ineffective.\n\n54:13.900 --> 54:17.460\n So like, if you actually want to practically help somehow,\n\n54:17.460 --> 54:19.300\n you're going to convince yourself that you can't,\n\n54:19.300 --> 54:21.060\n one person can't possibly help.\n\n54:22.180 --> 54:24.140\n And then you have a family, so you want to make,\n\n54:24.140 --> 54:25.700\n you know, you want to protect your family.\n\n54:25.700 --> 54:28.660\n You tell all these stories and over time,\n\n54:28.660 --> 54:32.540\n it, you naturally convince yourself to dehumanize the other.\n\n54:32.540 --> 54:35.220\n Yeah, I think about this a lot,\n\n54:38.580 --> 54:41.500\n mostly because I worry that I wouldn't be a good German.\n\n54:42.380 --> 54:44.580\n Yeah, no, no, that's right, that's right.\n\n54:44.580 --> 54:48.460\n And one of the, you know, one of my tasks as a teacher,\n\n54:48.460 --> 54:52.060\n right, our students, and I have, you know,\n\n54:52.060 --> 54:54.420\n classes on genocide, I have one now.\n\n54:55.900 --> 54:57.820\n And another one, by the way, on Stalin.\n\n54:58.900 --> 55:01.100\n But the one on genocide, you know,\n\n55:01.100 --> 55:05.820\n one of my tasks is to try to get the students to understand\n\n55:05.820 --> 55:09.100\n this is not about weird people who live far away\n\n55:09.100 --> 55:12.620\n in time and in place, but it's about them, you know?\n\n55:12.620 --> 55:15.300\n And that, you know, that's a hard lesson,\n\n55:15.300 --> 55:17.100\n but it's an important one, you know,\n\n55:17.100 --> 55:20.540\n that this is in all of us, you know, it's in all of us.\n\n55:20.540 --> 55:22.780\n And there's nothing, you know,\n\n55:22.780 --> 55:25.620\n and you just try to gird yourself up, you know,\n\n55:25.620 --> 55:29.460\n to try to figure out ways that maybe you won't be complicit.\n\n55:29.460 --> 55:33.580\n And that you learn how to stand by your principles,\n\n55:33.580 --> 55:36.140\n but it's very hard, it's extremely difficult.\n\n55:36.140 --> 55:38.700\n And you can't, the other interesting thing about it\n\n55:38.700 --> 55:40.300\n is it's not predictable.\n\n55:40.300 --> 55:42.660\n Now, there's, they've done a lot of studies of Poles,\n\n55:42.660 --> 55:45.860\n for example, who during the war saved Jews, you know?\n\n55:45.860 --> 55:47.780\n Well, who are the Poles who saved Jews\n\n55:47.780 --> 55:50.060\n versus those who turned them in?\n\n55:50.060 --> 55:51.780\n It's completely unpredictable.\n\n55:51.780 --> 55:53.820\n You know, sometimes it's the worst anti Semites\n\n55:53.820 --> 55:55.420\n who protect them because they don't believe\n\n55:55.420 --> 55:57.540\n they should be killed, right?\n\n55:57.540 --> 56:01.180\n And sometimes, you know, it's not predictable.\n\n56:01.180 --> 56:04.300\n It's not as if the humanists among us, you know,\n\n56:04.300 --> 56:08.980\n are the ones who, you know, consistently show up,\n\n56:08.980 --> 56:13.980\n you know, and experience danger, in other words,\n\n56:13.980 --> 56:15.700\n and are ready to take on danger\n\n56:16.740 --> 56:18.900\n to defend, you know, your fellow human beings.\n\n56:18.900 --> 56:19.820\n Not necessarily.\n\n56:19.820 --> 56:21.540\n I mean, sometimes simple people do it,\n\n56:21.540 --> 56:24.780\n and sometimes they do it for really simple reasons.\n\n56:24.780 --> 56:28.540\n And sometimes, people you would expect to do it don't.\n\n56:29.860 --> 56:32.620\n And you've got that mix, and it's just not predictable.\n\n56:33.540 --> 56:37.260\n One thing I've learned in this age of social media\n\n56:37.260 --> 56:39.780\n is it feels like the people with integrity\n\n56:39.780 --> 56:41.900\n and the ones who would do the right thing\n\n56:41.900 --> 56:43.220\n are the quiet ones.\n\n56:44.660 --> 56:46.860\n In terms of humanists, in terms of activists,\n\n56:46.860 --> 56:49.020\n there's so many points to be gained\n\n56:50.300 --> 56:53.460\n of declaring that you would do the right thing.\n\n56:53.460 --> 56:57.460\n It's the simple, quiet folks.\n\n56:58.700 --> 57:01.300\n Because I've seen quite, on a small,\n\n57:01.300 --> 57:03.460\n obviously much smaller scale,\n\n57:03.460 --> 57:05.900\n just shows of integrity and character.\n\n57:05.900 --> 57:09.380\n When there was sacrifice to be made and it was done quietly.\n\n57:09.380 --> 57:13.660\n Now, sort of the small heroes, those are,\n\n57:13.660 --> 57:17.260\n you're right, it's surprising, but they're often quiet.\n\n57:17.260 --> 57:18.900\n That's why I'm distrustful of people\n\n57:18.900 --> 57:21.380\n who kind of proclaim that they would do the right thing.\n\n57:21.380 --> 57:23.580\n Right, right.\n\n57:23.580 --> 57:25.500\n And there are different kinds of integrity, too.\n\n57:25.500 --> 57:30.500\n I mean, I edited a memoir of a Polish underground fighter,\n\n57:34.940 --> 57:37.180\n member of the underground who was in Majdanek\n\n57:37.180 --> 57:38.900\n in the concentration camp at Majdanek.\n\n57:38.900 --> 57:41.180\n You know, and it was just an interesting mix\n\n57:41.180 --> 57:43.540\n of different kinds of integrity.\n\n57:43.540 --> 57:45.140\n You know, on the one hand,\n\n57:45.140 --> 57:50.140\n it really bothered him deeply\n\n57:50.340 --> 57:52.820\n when Jews were killed or sent to camp\n\n57:52.820 --> 57:53.660\n or that sort of thing.\n\n57:53.660 --> 57:56.780\n On the other hand, he was something of an anti Semite.\n\n57:56.780 --> 57:59.660\n You know, he would, you know,\n\n57:59.660 --> 58:02.780\n sometimes if Jews were his friends, he would help them.\n\n58:02.780 --> 58:06.340\n And if they weren't, sometimes he was really mean to them.\n\n58:06.340 --> 58:08.180\n You know, and you could, in their various levels,\n\n58:08.180 --> 58:13.180\n you know, a concentration camp is a terrible social experiment\n\n58:13.180 --> 58:15.460\n in some ways, right?\n\n58:15.460 --> 58:19.940\n But you learn a lot from how people behave.\n\n58:19.940 --> 58:21.300\n And what you see is that, you know,\n\n58:21.300 --> 58:23.980\n people behave sometimes extraordinarily well\n\n58:23.980 --> 58:26.660\n in some situations and extraordinarily poorly in others.\n\n58:26.660 --> 58:28.740\n And it's mixed and you can't predict it.\n\n58:28.740 --> 58:32.380\n And it's hard to find consistency.\n\n58:32.380 --> 58:33.500\n I mean, that's the other thing.\n\n58:33.500 --> 58:37.180\n It's, you know, I think we claim too much consistency\n\n58:37.180 --> 58:38.460\n for the people we study\n\n58:38.460 --> 58:40.380\n and the people we think about in the past.\n\n58:40.380 --> 58:42.660\n You know, they're not consistent any more than we are\n\n58:42.660 --> 58:43.620\n consistent, right?\n\n58:45.140 --> 58:48.060\n Well, let me ask you about human nature here on both sides.\n\n58:48.060 --> 58:53.060\n So first, what have you learned about human nature\n\n58:53.100 --> 58:54.700\n from studying genocide?\n\n58:54.700 --> 58:56.820\n Why do humans commit genocide?\n\n58:56.820 --> 59:01.540\n What lessons, first of all, why is a difficult question,\n\n59:01.540 --> 59:04.860\n but what insights do you have into humans\n\n59:04.860 --> 59:07.820\n that genocide is something that happens in the world?\n\n59:07.820 --> 59:10.380\n That's a really big and difficult question, right?\n\n59:10.380 --> 59:13.900\n And it has to be parsed, I think,\n\n59:13.900 --> 59:16.420\n into different kinds of questions.\n\n59:16.420 --> 59:18.780\n You know, why does genocide happen?\n\n59:19.620 --> 59:24.380\n You know, which the answer there is frequently political,\n\n59:24.380 --> 59:28.940\n meaning, you know, why Hitler ended up killing the Jews.\n\n59:28.940 --> 59:32.020\n Well, it had a lot to do with the political history\n\n59:32.020 --> 59:35.380\n of Germany and wartime history of Germany, right?\n\n59:35.380 --> 59:40.380\n In the 30s, and, you know, it's traceable to then.\n\n59:40.500 --> 59:42.980\n No, like you mentioned it yourself,\n\n59:42.980 --> 59:46.020\n you can't imagine Hitler in the mid 20s\n\n59:46.020 --> 59:49.580\n turning into anything of the kind of dictator\n\n59:49.580 --> 59:53.180\n he ended up being and the kind of murderer,\n\n59:53.180 --> 59:55.540\n mass murderer he ended up being.\n\n59:55.540 --> 59:58.860\n So, and the same thing goes, by the way,\n\n59:58.860 --> 1:00:01.260\n for Stalin and Soviet Union and Pol Pot.\n\n1:00:01.260 --> 1:00:04.820\n I mean, these are all essentially political movements\n\n1:00:04.820 --> 1:00:08.140\n where the polity state is seized, you know,\n\n1:00:08.140 --> 1:00:13.140\n by a ideological or, you know, party, single party movement\n\n1:00:14.180 --> 1:00:15.780\n and then is moved in directions\n\n1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:18.500\n where mass killing takes place.\n\n1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:20.380\n The other question, you know,\n\n1:00:20.380 --> 1:00:22.620\n let's separate that question out.\n\n1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:26.780\n The other question is why do ordinary people participate?\n\n1:00:26.780 --> 1:00:31.060\n Because the fact of the matter is,\n\n1:00:31.060 --> 1:00:33.780\n just ordering genocide is not enough.\n\n1:00:33.780 --> 1:00:36.620\n Just saying, you know, go get them is not enough.\n\n1:00:36.620 --> 1:00:39.140\n There have to be people who will cooperate\n\n1:00:39.140 --> 1:00:41.420\n and who will do their jobs, you know,\n\n1:00:41.420 --> 1:00:43.060\n both at the kind of mezzo level,\n\n1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:45.340\n the middle level of a bureaucracy,\n\n1:00:45.340 --> 1:00:47.060\n but also at the everyday level.\n\n1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:48.700\n You know, people who have to pull the triggers\n\n1:00:48.700 --> 1:00:50.380\n and that kind of thing and, you know,\n\n1:00:50.380 --> 1:00:52.220\n force people into the gas chamber\n\n1:00:52.220 --> 1:00:56.740\n and grab people, you know, in Kiev in September 1941\n\n1:00:56.740 --> 1:01:00.540\n at Babin Yar and push them, you know, towards the ravine\n\n1:01:00.540 --> 1:01:03.900\n where the machine gunners are gonna shoot them down.\n\n1:01:03.900 --> 1:01:06.740\n You know, and those are all different questions.\n\n1:01:06.740 --> 1:01:11.740\n The question of, you know, especially the lower level people\n\n1:01:11.940 --> 1:01:14.460\n who actually do the killing is a question\n\n1:01:14.460 --> 1:01:15.980\n which I think we've been talking about,\n\n1:01:15.980 --> 1:01:18.460\n which is that within all of us,\n\n1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:21.980\n you know, is the capability of being murderers\n\n1:01:21.980 --> 1:01:22.940\n and mass murderers.\n\n1:01:22.940 --> 1:01:25.460\n I mean, to participate in mass murder.\n\n1:01:25.460 --> 1:01:27.860\n I won't call them laws of social psychology,\n\n1:01:27.860 --> 1:01:31.220\n but the character of social psychology.\n\n1:01:31.220 --> 1:01:33.380\n You know, we will do it in most cases.\n\n1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:35.700\n I mean, one of the shocking things that I learned\n\n1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:39.020\n just a few years ago studying the Holocaust\n\n1:01:39.020 --> 1:01:41.860\n is that you could pull out.\n\n1:01:41.860 --> 1:01:44.340\n In other words, if they order a police battalion\n\n1:01:44.340 --> 1:01:47.660\n to go shoot Jews, you didn't have to do it.\n\n1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:49.620\n You could pull out.\n\n1:01:49.620 --> 1:01:51.500\n They weren't gonna, they never killed anybody.\n\n1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:53.260\n They never executed anybody.\n\n1:01:53.260 --> 1:01:54.820\n They never even punished people for saying,\n\n1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:56.420\n no, I'm not gonna do that.\n\n1:01:56.420 --> 1:01:58.540\n So people are doing it voluntarily.\n\n1:01:58.540 --> 1:02:01.100\n They may not want to do it.\n\n1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:03.780\n You know, they give them booze to try to, you know,\n\n1:02:03.780 --> 1:02:06.460\n numb the pain of murder,\n\n1:02:06.460 --> 1:02:08.300\n because they know there is pain.\n\n1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:11.660\n I mean, people experience pain when they murder people,\n\n1:02:11.660 --> 1:02:13.860\n but they don't pull out.\n\n1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:16.700\n And so it's the character of who we are in the society,\n\n1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:20.220\n in groups, and we're very, very influenced.\n\n1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:22.660\n I mean, we're highly influenced by the groups\n\n1:02:22.660 --> 1:02:24.780\n in which we operate.\n\n1:02:24.780 --> 1:02:28.020\n And, you know, who we talk to,\n\n1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:30.900\n and who our friends are within that group,\n\n1:02:30.900 --> 1:02:32.820\n and who is the head of the group.\n\n1:02:32.820 --> 1:02:34.740\n And I mean, you see this even,\n\n1:02:34.740 --> 1:02:36.420\n I mean, you see it in any group, you know,\n\n1:02:36.420 --> 1:02:39.620\n whether it's in the academy, right, at Stanford,\n\n1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:42.300\n or whether it's, you know, in a labor union,\n\n1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:44.980\n or whether it's in a church group in Tennessee,\n\n1:02:44.980 --> 1:02:49.180\n or wherever, you know, people pay attention to each other,\n\n1:02:49.180 --> 1:02:54.180\n and they are unwilling, frequently, to say no.\n\n1:02:54.180 --> 1:02:56.220\n This is wrong.\n\n1:02:56.220 --> 1:02:58.260\n Even though all of you think it's right, it's wrong.\n\n1:02:58.260 --> 1:03:00.900\n I mean, you just don't do that, usually,\n\n1:03:00.900 --> 1:03:05.900\n especially in societies that are authoritarian,\n\n1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:08.100\n or totalitarian, right?\n\n1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:10.940\n Because it's harder, because there's a backup to it, right?\n\n1:03:10.940 --> 1:03:13.380\n There's the NKVD there, or there's the Gestapo there,\n\n1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:14.780\n and there are other people there.\n\n1:03:14.780 --> 1:03:18.900\n So you just, you know, they may not be forcing you to do it,\n\n1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:23.900\n but your social being, plus this danger in the distance,\n\n1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:28.460\n you know, you do it.\n\n1:03:28.460 --> 1:03:31.260\n But then, if you go up the hierarchy,\n\n1:03:31.260 --> 1:03:33.460\n at the very top, there's a dictator.\n\n1:03:33.460 --> 1:03:36.340\n Presumably, you know, you go to, like, middle management\n\n1:03:36.340 --> 1:03:37.520\n to the bureaucracy.\n\n1:03:39.860 --> 1:03:41.140\n The higher you get up there,\n\n1:03:41.140 --> 1:03:44.340\n the more power you have to change the direction\n\n1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:45.540\n of the Titanic.\n\n1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:46.940\n Right, right, right.\n\n1:03:46.940 --> 1:03:49.180\n But nobody seems to do it.\n\n1:03:49.180 --> 1:03:52.580\n Right, or what happens, and it does happen.\n\n1:03:52.580 --> 1:03:54.620\n It happens in the German army.\n\n1:03:54.620 --> 1:03:57.660\n I mean, it happens in the case of the Armenian genocide,\n\n1:03:57.660 --> 1:03:59.140\n where we know there are governors who said,\n\n1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:01.460\n no, I'm not gonna kill Armenians.\n\n1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:02.460\n What kind of business is this?\n\n1:04:02.460 --> 1:04:03.640\n They're just removed.\n\n1:04:04.540 --> 1:04:07.880\n They're removed, and you find a replacement very easily.\n\n1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:10.580\n So, you know, you do see people who stand up.\n\n1:04:10.580 --> 1:04:13.680\n And again, it's not really predictable who it will be.\n\n1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:14.540\n I would maintain.\n\n1:04:14.540 --> 1:04:18.120\n I mean, I haven't done the study of the Armenian governors\n\n1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:19.220\n who said no.\n\n1:04:19.220 --> 1:04:21.120\n I mean, the Turkish governors who said no\n\n1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:23.420\n to the Armenian genocide.\n\n1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:28.420\n But, you know, there are people who do step aside\n\n1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:31.060\n every once in a while in the middle level.\n\n1:04:31.060 --> 1:04:32.600\n And again, they're German generals who say,\n\n1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:34.420\n wait a minute, what is this business in Poland\n\n1:04:34.420 --> 1:04:37.920\n when they start to kill Jews or in Belorussia?\n\n1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:40.420\n And, you know, they're just pushed aside.\n\n1:04:40.420 --> 1:04:42.980\n You know, if they don't do their job, they're pushed aside.\n\n1:04:42.980 --> 1:04:44.060\n Or they end up doing it.\n\n1:04:44.060 --> 1:04:45.860\n And they usually do end up doing it.\n\n1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:49.700\n What about on the victim side?\n\n1:04:49.700 --> 1:04:51.740\n So, I mentioned man's search for meaning.\n\n1:04:52.740 --> 1:04:55.340\n What can we learn about human nature,\n\n1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:59.620\n the human mind from the victims of genocide?\n\n1:04:59.620 --> 1:05:02.340\n So, Viktor Frankl talked about the ability\n\n1:05:02.340 --> 1:05:06.000\n to discover meaning and beauty, even in suffering.\n\n1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:10.140\n Is there something to be said about, you know,\n\n1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:11.720\n in your studying of genocide\n\n1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:14.180\n that you've learned about human nature?\n\n1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:19.420\n Well, again, I don't, I have to say,\n\n1:05:19.420 --> 1:05:21.140\n I come out of the study of genocide\n\n1:05:21.140 --> 1:05:24.340\n with a very pessimistic view of human nature.\n\n1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:25.740\n A very pessimistic view.\n\n1:05:25.740 --> 1:05:26.900\n Even on the victim side?\n\n1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:28.960\n Even on the victim side.\n\n1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:33.640\n I mean, the victims will eat their children, right?\n\n1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:36.080\n Ukrainian case, they have no choice.\n\n1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:38.720\n You know, the victims will rob each other.\n\n1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:43.720\n The victims will form hierarchies within victimhood.\n\n1:05:44.020 --> 1:05:46.740\n So, you see, let me give you an example.\n\n1:05:46.740 --> 1:05:49.960\n Again, I told you I was working on Majdanek.\n\n1:05:50.860 --> 1:05:55.860\n And there's, in Majdanek, at a certain point in 42,\n\n1:05:57.340 --> 1:06:01.460\n a group of Slovak Jews were arrested\n\n1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.940\n and sent to Majdanek.\n\n1:06:04.940 --> 1:06:08.460\n Those Slovak Jews were a group,\n\n1:06:08.460 --> 1:06:11.340\n somehow they stuck together, they were very competent,\n\n1:06:11.340 --> 1:06:14.900\n they were, you know, many of them were businessmen,\n\n1:06:14.900 --> 1:06:16.460\n they knew each other,\n\n1:06:16.460 --> 1:06:19.900\n and for a variety of different reasons within the camp.\n\n1:06:19.900 --> 1:06:22.340\n And again, this shows you the diversity of the camps\n\n1:06:22.340 --> 1:06:24.560\n and also, you know, these images of black and white\n\n1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:26.780\n in the camps are not very useful.\n\n1:06:26.780 --> 1:06:29.060\n They ruled the camp.\n\n1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:31.160\n I mean, they basically had all the important jobs\n\n1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:35.780\n in the camp, including jobs like beating other Jews,\n\n1:06:35.780 --> 1:06:40.660\n and persecuting other Jews, and persecuting other peoples,\n\n1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:43.540\n which they did.\n\n1:06:43.540 --> 1:06:46.340\n And this Polish guy who I mentioned to you,\n\n1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:48.740\n who wrote this memoir, hated them\n\n1:06:48.740 --> 1:06:53.540\n because of what they were doing to the Poles, right?\n\n1:06:53.540 --> 1:06:57.460\n And he, you know, he's incensed\n\n1:06:57.460 --> 1:07:01.180\n because aren't these supposed to be the Untermenschen?\n\n1:07:01.180 --> 1:07:02.680\n He says, and look what they're doing,\n\n1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:06.220\n they're treating us, you know, like dirt.\n\n1:07:06.220 --> 1:07:08.780\n And they do, they treat them like dirt.\n\n1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:11.460\n So, you know, in this kind of work on Majdanek,\n\n1:07:11.460 --> 1:07:16.020\n there's certainly parts of it that, you know,\n\n1:07:16.020 --> 1:07:20.860\n were inspiring, you know, people helping each other,\n\n1:07:20.860 --> 1:07:23.100\n people trying to feed each other,\n\n1:07:23.100 --> 1:07:24.920\n people giving warmth to each other.\n\n1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:29.920\n You know, there's some very heroic Polish women\n\n1:07:30.420 --> 1:07:33.780\n who end up having a radio show called Radio Majdanek,\n\n1:07:33.780 --> 1:07:36.480\n which they put on every night in the women's camp,\n\n1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:39.420\n which is, you know, to raise people's spirits.\n\n1:07:39.420 --> 1:07:41.420\n And they, you know, sing songs\n\n1:07:41.420 --> 1:07:43.100\n and do all this kind of stuff, you know,\n\n1:07:43.100 --> 1:07:47.980\n to try to keep themselves from, you know,\n\n1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:51.100\n the horrors that they're experiencing around them.\n\n1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:54.220\n And so you do see that, and you do see,\n\n1:07:54.220 --> 1:07:59.220\n you know, human beings acting in support of each other.\n\n1:08:00.420 --> 1:08:05.420\n But, you know, I mean, Primo Levi is one of my favorite\n\n1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:10.340\n writers about the Holocaust and about the camps.\n\n1:08:10.340 --> 1:08:15.100\n And, you know, I don't think Primo Levi saw anything.\n\n1:08:15.100 --> 1:08:17.420\n You know, I mean, he had pals, you know,\n\n1:08:17.420 --> 1:08:20.060\n who he helped and who helped him.\n\n1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:25.060\n I mean, but he describes this kind of, you know,\n\n1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:27.520\n terrible inhuman environment,\n\n1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:30.460\n which no one can escape, really, no one can escape.\n\n1:08:30.460 --> 1:08:32.260\n He ends up committing suicide too, I think,\n\n1:08:32.260 --> 1:08:37.260\n because of his sense of, we don't know exactly why,\n\n1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:39.460\n but probably because of his sense\n\n1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:41.460\n of what happened in the camp.\n\n1:08:41.460 --> 1:08:42.900\n I mean, later he goes back to Italy,\n\n1:08:42.900 --> 1:08:44.580\n becomes a writer and that sort of thing.\n\n1:08:44.580 --> 1:08:49.340\n So I don't, I don't, especially in the concentration camps,\n\n1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:52.940\n it's really hard to find places like Wickel Frankel\n\n1:08:52.940 --> 1:08:54.420\n where you can say, you know,\n\n1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:59.420\n I am moved in a positive way, you know, by what happened.\n\n1:09:02.620 --> 1:09:04.300\n There were cases, there's no question.\n\n1:09:04.300 --> 1:09:06.360\n People hung together, they tried to help each other,\n\n1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:11.360\n but, you know, they were totally, totally caught\n\n1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:15.740\n in this web of genocide.\n\n1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:19.420\n See, so there are stories, but the thing is, I have this\n\n1:09:19.420 --> 1:09:22.900\n sense, maybe it's a hope, that within most,\n\n1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:26.620\n if not every human heart, there's a kind of, like,\n\n1:09:26.620 --> 1:09:31.620\n flame of compassion and kindness and love that waits,\n\n1:09:34.820 --> 1:09:37.240\n that longs to connect with others,\n\n1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:41.020\n that ultimately en masse overpowers everything else.\n\n1:09:41.020 --> 1:09:43.380\n If you just look at the story of human history,\n\n1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:48.380\n the resistance to violence and mass murder and genocide\n\n1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:52.900\n feels like a force that's there.\n\n1:09:54.140 --> 1:09:57.220\n And it feels like a force that's more powerful\n\n1:09:57.220 --> 1:10:02.220\n than whatever the dark momentum that leads to genocide is.\n\n1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:08.740\n It feels like that's more powerful, it's just quiet.\n\n1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:10.740\n It's hard to tell the story of that little flame\n\n1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:14.060\n that burns within all of our hearts,\n\n1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:16.580\n that longing to connect to other human beings.\n\n1:10:16.580 --> 1:10:18.940\n And there's something also about human nature\n\n1:10:18.940 --> 1:10:21.580\n and us as storytellers, that we're not very good\n\n1:10:21.580 --> 1:10:24.060\n at telling the stories of that little flame.\n\n1:10:24.060 --> 1:10:27.020\n We're much better at telling the stories of atrocities.\n\n1:10:27.020 --> 1:10:30.220\n No, you know, I think maybe I fundamentally\n\n1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:32.580\n disagree with you, I think maybe I fundamentally,\n\n1:10:32.580 --> 1:10:35.260\n I don't disagree that there is that flame.\n\n1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:38.920\n I just think it's just too easily doused.\n\n1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:43.340\n And I think it's too easily goes out in a lot of people.\n\n1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:48.340\n And I mean, like I say, I come away from this work,\n\n1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:50.820\n a pessimist.\n\n1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:54.640\n You know, there is this work by a Harvard psychologist,\n\n1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:55.480\n now I'm forgetting his name.\n\n1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:56.540\n Stephen Pinker.\n\n1:10:56.540 --> 1:11:01.260\n Yes, yes, Stephen Pinker, that shows over time, you know,\n\n1:11:01.260 --> 1:11:03.420\n and you know, initially I was quite skeptical of the work,\n\n1:11:03.420 --> 1:11:05.820\n but in the end, I thought he was quite convincing\n\n1:11:05.820 --> 1:11:10.820\n that over time, the incidence of homicide, you know,\n\n1:11:12.420 --> 1:11:14.900\n goes down, the incidence of rape goes down,\n\n1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:18.900\n the incidence of genocide, except for the big blip,\n\n1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:22.300\n you know, in the middle of the 20th century goes down.\n\n1:11:22.300 --> 1:11:24.820\n Not markedly, but it goes down generally,\n\n1:11:24.820 --> 1:11:27.860\n that you know, more than norms, international norms\n\n1:11:27.860 --> 1:11:30.100\n are changing how we think about this and stuff like that.\n\n1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:33.060\n I thought he was pretty convincing about that.\n\n1:11:33.060 --> 1:11:37.220\n But think about, you know, we're modern people.\n\n1:11:37.220 --> 1:11:41.980\n I mean, we've advanced so fast in so many different areas.\n\n1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:45.180\n I mean, we should have eliminated this a long time ago,\n\n1:11:45.180 --> 1:11:46.420\n a long time ago.\n\n1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:50.860\n You know, how is it that, you know,\n\n1:11:50.860 --> 1:11:54.380\n we're still facing this business of genocide in Myanmar,\n\n1:11:54.380 --> 1:11:59.380\n in Xinjiang, in, you know, Tigray, in Ethiopia,\n\n1:11:59.860 --> 1:12:02.380\n you know, the potentials of genocide there.\n\n1:12:02.380 --> 1:12:06.900\n And all over the world, you know, we still have this thing\n\n1:12:06.900 --> 1:12:10.220\n that we cannot handle, that we can't deal with.\n\n1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:14.340\n And, you know, again, you know, electric cars and planes\n\n1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:16.800\n that fly from here to, you know, Beijing.\n\n1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:21.260\n Think about the differences between 250 years ago\n\n1:12:21.260 --> 1:12:25.500\n or 300 years ago and today, but the differences in genocide\n\n1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:26.760\n are not all that great.\n\n1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:28.680\n I mean, the incidence has gone down.\n\n1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:31.360\n I think Pinker has demonstrated, I mean,\n\n1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:32.820\n there are problems with his methodology,\n\n1:12:32.820 --> 1:12:35.420\n but on the whole, I'm with him on that book.\n\n1:12:35.420 --> 1:12:38.940\n I thought in the end, it was quite well done.\n\n1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:43.940\n So, you know, I do not, I have to say,\n\n1:12:44.500 --> 1:12:48.960\n I'm not an optimist about what this human flame can do.\n\n1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:53.020\n And, you know, I once, someone once said to me,\n\n1:12:53.020 --> 1:12:56.300\n when I posed a similar kind of question to a seminar,\n\n1:12:56.300 --> 1:12:57.900\n a friend of mine at Berkeley once said,\n\n1:12:57.900 --> 1:13:01.620\n remember original sin, Norman, well, I don't, you know,\n\n1:13:01.620 --> 1:13:05.320\n that's very Catholic and I don't really think\n\n1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:09.080\n in terms of original sin, but in some ways, you know,\n\n1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:11.800\n her point is we carry this with us, you know,\n\n1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:16.800\n we carry with us a really potentially nasty mean streak\n\n1:13:20.220 --> 1:13:22.380\n that can do harm to other people.\n\n1:13:22.380 --> 1:13:24.620\n Well, we carry the capacity to love too.\n\n1:13:24.620 --> 1:13:26.240\n Yes, we do, yes, we do.\n\n1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:28.520\n That's part of the deal.\n\n1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:32.100\n You have a bias in that you have studied\n\n1:13:32.100 --> 1:13:34.880\n some of the darker aspects of human nature\n\n1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:36.580\n and human history.\n\n1:13:36.580 --> 1:13:41.580\n So it is difficult from the trenches, from the muck,\n\n1:13:42.540 --> 1:13:46.860\n to see a possible sort of way out through love.\n\n1:13:46.860 --> 1:13:50.500\n But it's not obvious that that's not the case.\n\n1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:54.800\n You mentioned electric cars and rockets and airplanes.\n\n1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:58.820\n To me, the more powerful thing is Wikipedia, the internet.\n\n1:13:58.820 --> 1:14:02.400\n Only 50% of the world currently has access to the internet,\n\n1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:05.900\n but that's growing in information and knowledge and wisdom,\n\n1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:08.180\n especially among women in the world.\n\n1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:12.680\n As that grows, I think it becomes a lot more difficult\n\n1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:15.200\n if love wins, it becomes a lot more difficult\n\n1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:16.820\n for somebody like Hitler to take power,\n\n1:14:16.820 --> 1:14:19.680\n for genocide to occur, because people think,\n\n1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:23.680\n and the masses, I think, the people have power\n\n1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:26.180\n when they're able to think,\n\n1:14:26.180 --> 1:14:28.180\n when they can see the full kind of...\n\n1:14:30.140 --> 1:14:34.040\n First of all, when they can study your work,\n\n1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:36.340\n they can know about the fact that genocide happens,\n\n1:14:36.340 --> 1:14:40.500\n how it occurs, how the promises of great charismatic leaders\n\n1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:44.700\n lead to great, destructive mass genocide.\n\n1:14:44.700 --> 1:14:48.940\n And just even studying the fact that the Holocaust happened\n\n1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:53.260\n for a large number of people is a powerful preventer\n\n1:14:53.260 --> 1:14:55.340\n of future genocide.\n\n1:14:55.340 --> 1:14:58.500\n One of the lessons of history is just knowing\n\n1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:01.580\n that this can happen, learning how it happens,\n\n1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:06.580\n that normal human beings, leaders that give big promises,\n\n1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:09.580\n can also become evil and destructive.\n\n1:15:09.580 --> 1:15:12.020\n The fact, knowing that that can happen\n\n1:15:12.020 --> 1:15:13.900\n is a powerful preventer of that,\n\n1:15:13.900 --> 1:15:16.860\n and then you kind of wake up from this haze\n\n1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:19.800\n of believing everything you hear,\n\n1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:24.800\n and you learn to just, in your small, local way,\n\n1:15:25.700 --> 1:15:28.940\n to put more love out there in the world.\n\n1:15:28.940 --> 1:15:31.460\n I believe it's possible, it's not too good,\n\n1:15:31.460 --> 1:15:35.300\n sort of to push back, it's not so obvious to me\n\n1:15:35.300 --> 1:15:40.040\n that in the end, I think in the end, love wins.\n\n1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:43.020\n That's my intuition, I've had to put money on it.\n\n1:15:43.020 --> 1:15:46.620\n I have a sense that this genocide thing\n\n1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:51.260\n is more and more going to be an artifact of the past.\n\n1:15:51.260 --> 1:15:53.100\n Well, I certainly hope you're right.\n\n1:15:53.100 --> 1:15:54.500\n I mean, I certainly hope you're right.\n\n1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:59.220\n And it could be you are, we don't know.\n\n1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:04.020\n But the evidence is different.\n\n1:16:04.020 --> 1:16:05.260\n The evidence is different.\n\n1:16:05.260 --> 1:16:10.260\n And the capacity of human beings to do evil\n\n1:16:10.260 --> 1:16:16.260\n to other human beings is repeatedly demonstrated.\n\n1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:20.140\n Whether it's in massacres in Mexico,\n\n1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:25.060\n or ISIS and the Yazidi Kurds,\n\n1:16:25.060 --> 1:16:27.640\n or you can just go on and on.\n\n1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:29.700\n Syria, I mean, look what, I mean,\n\n1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:34.700\n Syria used to be a country, and now it's been a mass grave,\n\n1:16:35.700 --> 1:16:39.300\n and people then have left in the millions\n\n1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:41.100\n for other places.\n\n1:16:41.100 --> 1:16:46.100\n And you know, I'm not saying, you know, I'm not saying,\n\n1:16:46.580 --> 1:16:48.980\n I mean, the Turks have done nice things for the Syrians,\n\n1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:51.120\n and the Germans welcomed in a million or so,\n\n1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:53.360\n and actually reasonably absorbed them.\n\n1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:57.660\n I mean, I'm not saying bad things only happen in the world.\n\n1:16:57.660 --> 1:16:59.100\n They're good and bad things that happen,\n\n1:16:59.100 --> 1:17:00.300\n you're absolutely right.\n\n1:17:02.220 --> 1:17:04.860\n But I don't think we're on the path\n\n1:17:04.860 --> 1:17:08.380\n to eliminating these bad things,\n\n1:17:08.380 --> 1:17:10.160\n really bad things from happening.\n\n1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:11.180\n I just don't think we are.\n\n1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:12.980\n And I don't think there's any,\n\n1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:15.500\n I don't think the facts demonstrate it.\n\n1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:17.300\n I mean, I hope, I hope you're right.\n\n1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:20.960\n But I think otherwise, it's just an article of faith.\n\n1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:23.580\n Well.\n\n1:17:23.580 --> 1:17:25.500\n You know, which is perfectly fine.\n\n1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:27.260\n It's better to have that article of faith\n\n1:17:27.260 --> 1:17:29.940\n than to have an article of faith which says,\n\n1:17:29.940 --> 1:17:32.180\n you know, things should get bad, or things like that.\n\n1:17:32.180 --> 1:17:33.900\n Well, it's not just fine.\n\n1:17:33.900 --> 1:17:36.860\n It's the only way if you want to build a better future.\n\n1:17:36.860 --> 1:17:38.760\n So optimism is a prerequisite\n\n1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:40.540\n for engineering a better future.\n\n1:17:40.540 --> 1:17:43.400\n So like, okay, so a historian\n\n1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:46.100\n has to see clearly into the past.\n\n1:17:46.100 --> 1:17:51.100\n An engineer has to imagine a future\n\n1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:54.220\n that's different from the past,\n\n1:17:54.220 --> 1:17:55.980\n that's better than the past.\n\n1:17:55.980 --> 1:17:57.420\n Because without that,\n\n1:17:57.420 --> 1:17:59.500\n they're not going to be able to build a better future.\n\n1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:01.240\n So there's a kind of saying,\n\n1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:02.620\n like you have to consider the facts.\n\n1:18:02.620 --> 1:18:05.540\n Well, at every single moment in history,\n\n1:18:05.540 --> 1:18:10.120\n if you allow yourself to be too grounded\n\n1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:11.300\n by the facts of the past,\n\n1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:12.800\n you're not going to create the future.\n\n1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.140\n So that's kind of the tension that we're living with.\n\n1:18:15.140 --> 1:18:16.820\n To have a chance, we have to imagine\n\n1:18:16.820 --> 1:18:18.640\n that the better future is possible.\n\n1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:23.980\n But one of the ways to do that is to study history.\n\n1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:25.940\n Which engineers don't do enough of.\n\n1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:26.780\n They do not.\n\n1:18:26.780 --> 1:18:29.260\n Which is a real problem.\n\n1:18:29.260 --> 1:18:30.980\n It's a real problem.\n\n1:18:30.980 --> 1:18:33.180\n Or basically a lot of disciplines in science\n\n1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:35.240\n and so on don't do enough of.\n\n1:18:36.620 --> 1:18:41.360\n Can you tell the story of China from 1958 to 1962,\n\n1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:44.980\n what was called the Great Leap Forward,\n\n1:18:44.980 --> 1:18:47.420\n orchestrated by Chairman Mao Zedong\n\n1:18:47.420 --> 1:18:49.780\n that led to the deaths of tens of millions of people\n\n1:18:49.780 --> 1:18:53.560\n making it arguably the largest famine in human history?\n\n1:18:55.020 --> 1:18:55.840\n Yes.\n\n1:18:55.840 --> 1:18:59.860\n I mean, it was a terrible set of events\n\n1:18:59.860 --> 1:19:02.220\n that led to the death.\n\n1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:04.060\n People will dispute the numbers.\n\n1:19:07.060 --> 1:19:11.300\n 15 million, 17 million, 14 million,\n\n1:19:11.300 --> 1:19:15.540\n 20 million people died in the Great Leap.\n\n1:19:15.540 --> 1:19:17.420\n Many people say 30, 40, 50 million.\n\n1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:18.980\n Some people will go that high too.\n\n1:19:18.980 --> 1:19:21.060\n That's right, that's right.\n\n1:19:21.060 --> 1:19:25.260\n Essentially, Mao and the Communist Party leadership,\n\n1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:28.500\n but it was mostly Mao's doing,\n\n1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:33.220\n decided he wanted to move the country into communism.\n\n1:19:33.220 --> 1:19:35.980\n And part of the idea of that\n\n1:19:35.980 --> 1:19:37.940\n was rivalry with the Soviet Union.\n\n1:19:39.660 --> 1:19:41.220\n Mao was a good Stalinist,\n\n1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:43.300\n or at least felt like Stalin\n\n1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:46.380\n was the right kind of communist leader to have,\n\n1:19:46.380 --> 1:19:48.100\n and he didn't like Khrushchev at all,\n\n1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:51.220\n and he didn't like what he thought were Khrushchev's reforms\n\n1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:54.180\n and also Khrushchev's pretensions\n\n1:19:54.180 --> 1:19:57.180\n to moving the Soviet Union into communism.\n\n1:19:57.180 --> 1:19:59.700\n So Khrushchev started talking about giving more power\n\n1:19:59.700 --> 1:20:01.740\n to the party, less power to the state,\n\n1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:04.480\n and if you have more power to the party versus the state,\n\n1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:07.220\n then you're moving into communism quicker.\n\n1:20:07.220 --> 1:20:11.380\n So what Mao decided to do was to engage in this vast program\n\n1:20:12.340 --> 1:20:16.980\n of building what were called people's communes.\n\n1:20:16.980 --> 1:20:21.980\n And these communes were enormous conglomerations\n\n1:20:22.300 --> 1:20:25.500\n of essentially collective farms,\n\n1:20:25.500 --> 1:20:28.380\n and what would happen on those communes\n\n1:20:28.380 --> 1:20:31.540\n is there would be places for people to eat,\n\n1:20:31.540 --> 1:20:34.920\n and there would be places for the kids to be raised\n\n1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:38.020\n in essentially kind of separate homes,\n\n1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:39.980\n and they would be schooled.\n\n1:20:39.980 --> 1:20:42.700\n Everybody would turn over their metal,\n\n1:20:42.700 --> 1:20:43.540\n which was one of the,\n\n1:20:43.540 --> 1:20:46.780\n actually it turned out to be a terribly negative phenomenon,\n\n1:20:46.780 --> 1:20:51.700\n their metal pots and pans to be melted to then make steel.\n\n1:20:51.700 --> 1:20:55.700\n Every of these big communes would all have little steel plants\n\n1:20:55.700 --> 1:20:57.300\n and they would build steel\n\n1:20:57.300 --> 1:21:01.340\n and the whole countryside would be transformed.\n\n1:21:01.340 --> 1:21:03.420\n Well, like many of these sort of,\n\n1:21:03.420 --> 1:21:07.660\n I mean a true megalomaniac project,\n\n1:21:07.660 --> 1:21:10.220\n like some of Stalin's projects too.\n\n1:21:10.220 --> 1:21:12.980\n And this particular project then,\n\n1:21:12.980 --> 1:21:15.260\n the people had no choice.\n\n1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:18.740\n They were forced to do this.\n\n1:21:18.740 --> 1:21:23.740\n It was incredibly dysfunctional for Chinese agriculture\n\n1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:30.820\n and ended up creating, as you mentioned, a terrible famine\n\n1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:36.460\n that everybody understood was a famine as a result of this.\n\n1:21:36.460 --> 1:21:40.380\n I mean, there were also some problems of nature\n\n1:21:40.380 --> 1:21:42.740\n at the same time and some flooding and bad weather\n\n1:21:42.740 --> 1:21:46.140\n and that sort of thing, but it was really a manmade famine.\n\n1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:51.140\n And Mao said at one point, who cares if millions die?\n\n1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:53.940\n It just doesn't matter.\n\n1:21:53.940 --> 1:21:55.340\n We've got millions more left.\n\n1:21:55.340 --> 1:21:57.820\n I mean, he would periodically say things like this\n\n1:21:57.820 --> 1:22:02.820\n that showed that like Stalin, he had total indifference\n\n1:22:03.140 --> 1:22:06.340\n to the fact that people were dying in large numbers.\n\n1:22:06.340 --> 1:22:08.140\n It led again to cannibalism\n\n1:22:08.140 --> 1:22:13.140\n and to terrible wastage all over the country\n\n1:22:13.780 --> 1:22:15.060\n and millions of people died\n\n1:22:15.060 --> 1:22:17.180\n and there was just no stopping it.\n\n1:22:18.180 --> 1:22:19.260\n There were people in the party\n\n1:22:19.260 --> 1:22:22.620\n who began to kind of edge towards telling Mao\n\n1:22:22.620 --> 1:22:26.260\n this wasn't a great idea and that he should back off,\n\n1:22:26.260 --> 1:22:28.460\n but he wouldn't back off.\n\n1:22:28.460 --> 1:22:32.060\n And the result was catastrophe in the countryside\n\n1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:33.220\n and all these people dying.\n\n1:22:33.220 --> 1:22:38.180\n And then compounding the problem was the political elite,\n\n1:22:38.180 --> 1:22:41.140\n which then if peasants would object\n\n1:22:41.140 --> 1:22:43.340\n or if certain people would say,\n\n1:22:43.340 --> 1:22:45.020\n no, they'd beat the hell out of them.\n\n1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:47.860\n They would beat people who didn't do\n\n1:22:47.860 --> 1:22:49.140\n what they wanted them to do.\n\n1:22:49.140 --> 1:22:54.140\n So it was really, really a horrific set of events\n\n1:22:54.980 --> 1:22:59.220\n on the Chinese countryside.\n\n1:22:59.220 --> 1:23:02.540\n I mean, and people wrote about it.\n\n1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:04.460\n I mean, we learned about it.\n\n1:23:04.460 --> 1:23:05.940\n There were people who were keeping track\n\n1:23:05.940 --> 1:23:09.100\n of what was going on and eventually wrote books about it.\n\n1:23:09.100 --> 1:23:13.020\n So we have, I mean, we have pretty good documentation,\n\n1:23:13.020 --> 1:23:14.140\n not so much on the numbers.\n\n1:23:14.140 --> 1:23:17.700\n Numbers are always a difficult problem.\n\n1:23:17.700 --> 1:23:19.100\n I'm facing this problem, by the way,\n\n1:23:19.100 --> 1:23:23.100\n this is a little bit separate with the Holodomor,\n\n1:23:23.100 --> 1:23:25.060\n where Ukrainians are now claiming\n\n1:23:25.060 --> 1:23:27.980\n 11.5 million people died in Holodomor.\n\n1:23:27.980 --> 1:23:29.740\n And most people assume it's somewhere\n\n1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:33.180\n in the neighborhood of four million, 4.5 million maybe.\n\n1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:36.380\n So you have wildly different numbers that come out.\n\n1:23:36.380 --> 1:23:37.900\n Then we have different kinds of numbers,\n\n1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:41.540\n as you mentioned too, with the Great Leap Forward.\n\n1:23:41.540 --> 1:23:45.220\n So it was a huge catastrophe for China\n\n1:23:45.220 --> 1:23:47.820\n and now only backed off when he had to.\n\n1:23:47.820 --> 1:23:50.620\n And then revived a little bit\n\n1:23:50.620 --> 1:23:53.860\n with the Red Guards Movement later on\n\n1:23:53.860 --> 1:23:57.980\n when he was upset that the bureaucracy\n\n1:23:57.980 --> 1:24:00.260\n was resisting him a little bit\n\n1:24:00.260 --> 1:24:01.620\n when it came to the Great Leap.\n\n1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:03.260\n But he had to back off.\n\n1:24:03.260 --> 1:24:05.940\n It was such a terrible catastrophe.\n\n1:24:05.940 --> 1:24:07.620\n So one of the things about numbers\n\n1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:10.380\n is that you usually talk about deaths,\n\n1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:13.300\n but with the famine, with starvation,\n\n1:24:14.780 --> 1:24:16.820\n the thing I often think about\n\n1:24:16.820 --> 1:24:18.580\n that's impossible to put into numbers\n\n1:24:18.580 --> 1:24:20.100\n is the number of people\n\n1:24:21.180 --> 1:24:24.020\n and the degree to which they were suffering.\n\n1:24:24.020 --> 1:24:28.780\n You know, the number of days spent in suffering.\n\n1:24:28.780 --> 1:24:30.020\n Oh yeah, oh yeah.\n\n1:24:30.020 --> 1:24:31.700\n And so, I mean, death is,\n\n1:24:36.300 --> 1:24:39.700\n death is just one of the consequences of suffering.\n\n1:24:39.700 --> 1:24:43.740\n To me, it feels like one, two, three years or months\n\n1:24:43.740 --> 1:24:48.740\n and then years of not having anything to eat is worse.\n\n1:24:51.780 --> 1:24:55.260\n And those aren't put into numbers often.\n\n1:24:55.260 --> 1:24:56.100\n That's right.\n\n1:24:56.100 --> 1:24:57.940\n And the effect on people long term,\n\n1:24:57.940 --> 1:24:59.540\n you know, in terms of their mental health,\n\n1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:02.540\n in terms of their physical health,\n\n1:25:02.540 --> 1:25:05.180\n their ability to work, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:25:05.180 --> 1:25:07.180\n I mean, Ukrainians are working on,\n\n1:25:07.180 --> 1:25:09.260\n there are people working on this subject now.\n\n1:25:09.260 --> 1:25:13.020\n You know, the longterm effect of the hunger famine on them.\n\n1:25:13.020 --> 1:25:16.220\n And I'm sure there's a similar kind of longterm effect\n\n1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:18.100\n on Chinese peasantry of what happened.\n\n1:25:18.100 --> 1:25:20.060\n You know, I mean, you're destroying.\n\n1:25:20.060 --> 1:25:21.020\n Multigenerational.\n\n1:25:21.020 --> 1:25:22.300\n Yes, multigenerational.\n\n1:25:22.300 --> 1:25:23.620\n That's right, that's right.\n\n1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:26.580\n And you know, it's a really, you're absolutely right.\n\n1:25:26.580 --> 1:25:29.140\n This is a terrible, terrible way to die.\n\n1:25:29.140 --> 1:25:31.500\n And it lasts a long time.\n\n1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:34.340\n And sometimes you don't die, you survive,\n\n1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:37.220\n but you know, in the kind of shape\n\n1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:39.780\n where you can't do anything.\n\n1:25:39.780 --> 1:25:42.060\n I mean, you can't function.\n\n1:25:42.060 --> 1:25:44.900\n Now your brain's been injured, you know.\n\n1:25:44.900 --> 1:25:49.180\n I know it's a really, these famines are really horrible.\n\n1:25:49.180 --> 1:25:50.020\n You're right.\n\n1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:50.980\n So when you talk about genocide,\n\n1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:52.620\n it's often talking about murder.\n\n1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:55.180\n Where do you place North Korea in this discussion?\n\n1:25:55.180 --> 1:25:56.940\n We kind of mentioned it.\n\n1:25:56.940 --> 1:25:58.860\n So in the, what is it?\n\n1:25:58.860 --> 1:26:03.860\n The Arduous March of the 1990s,\n\n1:26:03.860 --> 1:26:08.340\n where it was mass starvation.\n\n1:26:08.340 --> 1:26:10.860\n Many people describe mass starvation\n\n1:26:10.860 --> 1:26:13.140\n going on now in North Korea.\n\n1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:14.340\n When you think about genocide,\n\n1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:18.740\n when you think about atrocities going on in the world today,\n\n1:26:18.740 --> 1:26:20.740\n where do you place North Korea?\n\n1:26:20.740 --> 1:26:22.300\n So take a step back.\n\n1:26:22.300 --> 1:26:24.780\n When the, there were all these courts\n\n1:26:24.780 --> 1:26:28.180\n that were set up for Bosnia and for Rwanda\n\n1:26:28.180 --> 1:26:34.060\n and for other genocides in the 1990s.\n\n1:26:34.060 --> 1:26:37.340\n And then the decision was made\n\n1:26:37.340 --> 1:26:39.860\n by the international community, UN basically,\n\n1:26:39.860 --> 1:26:43.100\n to set up the International Criminal Court,\n\n1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:47.500\n which would then try genocide in the more modern period\n\n1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:49.540\n and the more contemporary period.\n\n1:26:49.540 --> 1:26:54.540\n And the ICC lists three crimes basically.\n\n1:26:54.540 --> 1:26:59.540\n The genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\n1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:07.180\n And subsumed to crimes against humanity\n\n1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:08.660\n are a lot of the kinds of things\n\n1:27:08.660 --> 1:27:10.780\n you're talking about with North Korea.\n\n1:27:10.780 --> 1:27:13.700\n I mean, it's torture, it's artificial,\n\n1:27:13.700 --> 1:27:16.900\n sometimes artificial famine or famine,\n\n1:27:16.900 --> 1:27:21.060\n that is not necessary, right?\n\n1:27:21.060 --> 1:27:22.980\n Not necessary to have it.\n\n1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:26.020\n And there are other kinds of, you know,\n\n1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:28.340\n mass rape and stuff like that.\n\n1:27:28.340 --> 1:27:31.140\n There are other kinds of things that fit\n\n1:27:31.140 --> 1:27:33.460\n into the crimes against humanity.\n\n1:27:33.460 --> 1:27:36.380\n And that's sort of where I think about North Korea\n\n1:27:36.380 --> 1:27:39.180\n as committing crimes against humanity, not genocide.\n\n1:27:39.180 --> 1:27:43.180\n And again, remember, genocide is meant to be,\n\n1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:46.860\n I mean, some people, there's a disagreement\n\n1:27:46.860 --> 1:27:48.820\n among scholars and jurists about this.\n\n1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:51.900\n Some people think of genocide as the crime of crimes,\n\n1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:55.140\n the worst of the three that I just mentioned.\n\n1:27:55.140 --> 1:27:56.980\n But some think of them as co equal.\n\n1:27:56.980 --> 1:28:00.460\n And the ICC, the International Criminal Court,\n\n1:28:00.460 --> 1:28:03.300\n is dealing with them more or less as co equal,\n\n1:28:03.300 --> 1:28:06.500\n even though we tend to think of genocide as the worst.\n\n1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:08.940\n So I mean, what I'm trying to say is that,\n\n1:28:08.940 --> 1:28:11.660\n you know, I don't wanna split hairs.\n\n1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:15.460\n I think it's sort of morally and ethically unseemly,\n\n1:28:15.460 --> 1:28:18.020\n you know, the split hairs about what is genocide,\n\n1:28:18.020 --> 1:28:20.700\n what is the crime against humanity.\n\n1:28:20.700 --> 1:28:22.980\n You know, this is for lawyers, not for historians.\n\n1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:24.100\n But terminology wise.\n\n1:28:24.100 --> 1:28:28.340\n Yeah, yeah, you know, you don't wanna get into that.\n\n1:28:28.340 --> 1:28:32.180\n Because it, I mean, it happened with Darfur a little bit,\n\n1:28:32.180 --> 1:28:35.660\n where the Bush administration had declared\n\n1:28:35.660 --> 1:28:37.820\n that Darfur was a genocide.\n\n1:28:37.820 --> 1:28:41.700\n And the UN said, no, no, it wasn't genocide,\n\n1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:43.380\n it was a crime against humanity.\n\n1:28:43.380 --> 1:28:45.260\n And then, you know, that confused things\n\n1:28:45.260 --> 1:28:47.260\n versus clarified them.\n\n1:28:47.260 --> 1:28:49.300\n I mean, we damn well knew what was happening.\n\n1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:51.500\n People were being killed and being attacked.\n\n1:28:52.500 --> 1:28:55.220\n And so, you know, on the one hand,\n\n1:28:55.220 --> 1:28:58.340\n I think the whole concept and the way of thinking\n\n1:28:59.820 --> 1:29:04.060\n about history using genocide as an important part\n\n1:29:04.060 --> 1:29:08.020\n of human history is crucial.\n\n1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:12.700\n On the other hand, I don't like to, you know,\n\n1:29:12.700 --> 1:29:13.900\n get involved in the hair splitting,\n\n1:29:13.900 --> 1:29:15.340\n what's genocide and what's not.\n\n1:29:15.340 --> 1:29:18.580\n So that, you know, North Korea, I tend to think of,\n\n1:29:18.580 --> 1:29:22.620\n like I said, as committing crimes against humanity\n\n1:29:22.620 --> 1:29:25.540\n and, you know, forcibly incarcerating people,\n\n1:29:25.540 --> 1:29:28.100\n torturing them, that kind of thing.\n\n1:29:28.100 --> 1:29:30.940\n You know, routinely incarcerating, depriving them\n\n1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:33.620\n of certain kinds of human rights\n\n1:29:33.620 --> 1:29:35.700\n can be considered a crime against humanity.\n\n1:29:35.700 --> 1:29:37.980\n But I don't think of it in the same way\n\n1:29:37.980 --> 1:29:39.940\n I think about genocide, which is an attack\n\n1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:40.780\n on a group of people.\n\n1:29:40.780 --> 1:29:42.780\n Let me just leave it at that.\n\n1:29:42.780 --> 1:29:45.820\n What in this, if we think about, if it's okay,\n\n1:29:45.820 --> 1:29:48.140\n can we loosely use the term genocide here,\n\n1:29:48.140 --> 1:29:50.860\n just let's not play games with terminology.\n\n1:29:50.860 --> 1:29:54.700\n Just bad crimes against humanity.\n\n1:29:56.900 --> 1:29:58.620\n Of particular interest are the ones\n\n1:29:58.620 --> 1:30:01.620\n that are going on today still,\n\n1:30:01.620 --> 1:30:04.460\n because it raises the question to us,\n\n1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:07.940\n what do people outside of this,\n\n1:30:07.940 --> 1:30:09.300\n what role do they have to play?\n\n1:30:09.300 --> 1:30:12.380\n So what role does the United States,\n\n1:30:12.380 --> 1:30:18.700\n or what role do I, as a human being who has food today,\n\n1:30:18.700 --> 1:30:21.420\n who has shelter, who has a comfortable life,\n\n1:30:21.420 --> 1:30:26.100\n what role do I have when I think about North Korea,\n\n1:30:26.100 --> 1:30:27.340\n when I think about Syria,\n\n1:30:27.340 --> 1:30:31.420\n when I think about maybe the Uighur population in China?\n\n1:30:33.140 --> 1:30:36.060\n Well, I mean, the role is the same role I have,\n\n1:30:36.060 --> 1:30:38.380\n which is to teach and to learn\n\n1:30:38.380 --> 1:30:43.380\n and to get the message out that this is happening,\n\n1:30:43.620 --> 1:30:45.740\n because the more people who understand it,\n\n1:30:45.740 --> 1:30:48.580\n the more likely it is that the United States government\n\n1:30:48.580 --> 1:30:50.620\n will try to do something about it,\n\n1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:56.660\n within the context of who we are and where we live, right?\n\n1:30:56.660 --> 1:31:00.860\n And so, I write books, you do shows,\n\n1:31:02.020 --> 1:31:04.620\n or maybe you write books too, I don't know.\n\n1:31:04.620 --> 1:31:08.500\n I do not write books, but I tweet.\n\n1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:09.700\n Okay, that's good too.\n\n1:31:09.700 --> 1:31:11.380\n Ineloquently, but that's not the,\n\n1:31:11.380 --> 1:31:14.300\n I guess that's not the, yes, so certainly this is true.\n\n1:31:14.300 --> 1:31:17.020\n And in terms of a voice, in terms of words,\n\n1:31:17.020 --> 1:31:19.420\n in terms of books, you are, I would say,\n\n1:31:19.420 --> 1:31:21.220\n a rare example of somebody\n\n1:31:21.220 --> 1:31:25.060\n that has powerful reach with words.\n\n1:31:25.060 --> 1:31:27.180\n But I was also referring to actions.\n\n1:31:28.300 --> 1:31:31.780\n In the United States government, what are the options here?\n\n1:31:31.780 --> 1:31:35.140\n So, war has costs,\n\n1:31:35.140 --> 1:31:39.100\n and war seems to be, as you have described,\n\n1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:43.260\n sort of potentially increase the atrocity, not decrease it.\n\n1:31:44.380 --> 1:31:48.460\n If there's anything that challenges my hope for the future\n\n1:31:48.460 --> 1:31:52.940\n is the fact that sometimes we're not powerless to help,\n\n1:31:52.940 --> 1:31:55.980\n but very close to powerless to help,\n\n1:31:55.980 --> 1:32:00.260\n because trying to help can often lead to,\n\n1:32:00.260 --> 1:32:04.660\n in the near term, more negative effects than positive effects.\n\n1:32:04.660 --> 1:32:05.620\n That's exactly right.\n\n1:32:05.620 --> 1:32:10.180\n I mean, the unintended consequences of what we do\n\n1:32:10.180 --> 1:32:13.540\n can frequently be as bad, if not worse,\n\n1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:17.060\n than trying to relieve the difficulties\n\n1:32:17.060 --> 1:32:17.900\n that people are having.\n\n1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:21.500\n So I think you're caught a little bit,\n\n1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:25.220\n but it's also true, I think, that we can be more forceful.\n\n1:32:25.220 --> 1:32:29.620\n I think we can be more forceful without necessarily war.\n\n1:32:29.620 --> 1:32:33.700\n There is this idea of the so called responsibility\n\n1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:37.820\n to protect, and this was an idea that came up\n\n1:32:37.820 --> 1:32:42.820\n after Kosovo, which was what, 1999,\n\n1:32:42.820 --> 1:32:47.820\n and when the Serbs looked like they were going to engage\n\n1:32:48.500 --> 1:32:50.540\n in a genocidal program in Kosovo,\n\n1:32:50.540 --> 1:32:53.180\n and it was basically a program of ethnic cleansing,\n\n1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:56.220\n but it could have gone bad and gotten worse,\n\n1:32:56.220 --> 1:32:59.540\n not just driving people out, but beginning to kill them.\n\n1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:04.540\n And the United States and Britain and others intervened.\n\n1:33:05.260 --> 1:33:08.860\n And Russians were there too, as you probably recall.\n\n1:33:08.860 --> 1:33:13.860\n And I think correctly, people have analyzed this\n\n1:33:13.940 --> 1:33:18.940\n as a case in which genocide was prevented or stopped.\n\n1:33:19.940 --> 1:33:22.020\n In other words, the Serbs were stopped in their tracks.\n\n1:33:22.020 --> 1:33:23.460\n I mean, some bad things did happen.\n\n1:33:23.460 --> 1:33:25.660\n We bombed Belgrade and the Chinese embassy\n\n1:33:25.660 --> 1:33:27.100\n and things like that.\n\n1:33:27.100 --> 1:33:32.100\n But it was stopped, and following upon that,\n\n1:33:32.340 --> 1:33:35.620\n then there was a kind of international consensus\n\n1:33:35.620 --> 1:33:36.900\n that we needed to do something.\n\n1:33:36.900 --> 1:33:39.500\n I mean, because of Rwanda, Bosnia,\n\n1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:42.580\n and the positive example of Kosovo, right?\n\n1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:46.580\n That genocide did not happen in Kosovo.\n\n1:33:46.580 --> 1:33:50.740\n I think that argument has been substantiated.\n\n1:33:50.740 --> 1:33:55.460\n Anyway, and this notion of the,\n\n1:33:55.460 --> 1:33:58.460\n or this doctrine or whatever,\n\n1:33:58.460 --> 1:34:00.860\n of the responsibility to protect them\n\n1:34:00.860 --> 1:34:05.860\n was adopted by the UN in 2005, unanimously.\n\n1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:11.500\n And what it says is there's a hierarchy of measures\n\n1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:14.980\n that should be, well, let me take a step back.\n\n1:34:14.980 --> 1:34:19.980\n It starts with the principle that sovereignty of a country\n\n1:34:21.060 --> 1:34:24.820\n is not, you don't earn it just by being there\n\n1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:27.300\n and being your own country.\n\n1:34:27.300 --> 1:34:29.900\n You have to earn it by protecting your people.\n\n1:34:30.980 --> 1:34:32.820\n So every, this was all agreed\n\n1:34:32.820 --> 1:34:35.140\n with all the nations of the UN agreed,\n\n1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:37.820\n Chinese and Russians too,\n\n1:34:37.820 --> 1:34:42.820\n that sovereignty is there because you protect your people\n\n1:34:43.340 --> 1:34:46.380\n against various depredations, right?\n\n1:34:46.380 --> 1:34:49.740\n Including genocide, crimes against humanity,\n\n1:34:49.740 --> 1:34:52.820\n forced imprisonment, torture, and that sort of thing.\n\n1:34:52.820 --> 1:34:57.820\n If you violate that justification for your sovereignty,\n\n1:34:59.980 --> 1:35:01.460\n that you're protecting your people,\n\n1:35:01.460 --> 1:35:03.260\n that you're not protecting them,\n\n1:35:03.260 --> 1:35:06.860\n the international community has the obligation\n\n1:35:06.860 --> 1:35:09.020\n to do something about it, all right?\n\n1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:11.860\n Now, then they have a kind of hierarchy\n\n1:35:11.860 --> 1:35:14.180\n of things you can do, you know, starting with,\n\n1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:17.020\n I mean, I'm not quoting exactly,\n\n1:35:17.020 --> 1:35:19.380\n but, you know, starting with kind of push and pull,\n\n1:35:19.380 --> 1:35:20.860\n you know, trying to convince people,\n\n1:35:20.860 --> 1:35:23.380\n don't do that, you know, to Myanmar,\n\n1:35:23.380 --> 1:35:26.020\n don't do that to the Rohingya people, right?\n\n1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:29.500\n Then it goes down the list, you know,\n\n1:35:29.500 --> 1:35:32.300\n and you get to sanctions or threatening sanctions\n\n1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:36.700\n and then sanctions, you know, like we have against Russia,\n\n1:35:36.700 --> 1:35:38.540\n but you go down the list, right?\n\n1:35:38.540 --> 1:35:41.220\n You go down the list and eventually\n\n1:35:42.260 --> 1:35:44.380\n you get to military intervention at the bottom,\n\n1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:46.860\n which they say is the last thing, you know,\n\n1:35:46.860 --> 1:35:50.100\n and you really don't wanna do that.\n\n1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:52.020\n And not only do you not wanna do it,\n\n1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:54.740\n but it, just as you said, just as you pointed out,\n\n1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:58.180\n it can have unintended consequences, right?\n\n1:35:58.180 --> 1:36:01.460\n And we'll do everything we can short,\n\n1:36:01.460 --> 1:36:03.420\n you know, of military intervention,\n\n1:36:03.420 --> 1:36:06.300\n but, you know, if necessary,\n\n1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:09.140\n that can be undertaken as well.\n\n1:36:09.140 --> 1:36:11.140\n And so the responsibility to predict, I think,\n\n1:36:11.140 --> 1:36:16.060\n is, you know, it was not implementable.\n\n1:36:16.060 --> 1:36:20.620\n Oh, one of the things it says in this last category, right?\n\n1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:23.500\n The military intervention is that the intervention\n\n1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:28.500\n cannot create more damage than it relieves, right?\n\n1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:34.020\n And so for Syria, we came to the conclusion,\n\n1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:36.740\n you know, that, I mean, the international community\n\n1:36:36.740 --> 1:36:39.620\n in some ways said this in so many words,\n\n1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:41.460\n even though the Russians were there, obviously,\n\n1:36:41.460 --> 1:36:43.220\n we ended up being there and that sort of thing,\n\n1:36:43.220 --> 1:36:45.420\n but the international community basically said,\n\n1:36:45.420 --> 1:36:48.220\n you know, there's no way you can intervene in Syria.\n\n1:36:48.220 --> 1:36:52.100\n You know, there's just no way without causing more damage,\n\n1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:54.220\n you know, than you would relieve.\n\n1:36:54.220 --> 1:36:56.820\n So, you know, in some senses,\n\n1:36:56.820 --> 1:36:58.460\n that's what the international community is saying\n\n1:36:58.460 --> 1:37:02.060\n about, you know, Xinjiang and the Uighurs too.\n\n1:37:02.060 --> 1:37:04.740\n You know, I mean, you can't even imagine\n\n1:37:05.660 --> 1:37:07.100\n what hell would break loose\n\n1:37:07.100 --> 1:37:10.300\n if there was some kind of military trouble, you know,\n\n1:37:10.300 --> 1:37:12.740\n to threaten the Chinese with.\n\n1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:16.340\n But you can go down that list\n\n1:37:16.340 --> 1:37:19.740\n with the, you know, the military leadership of Myanmar,\n\n1:37:19.740 --> 1:37:21.140\n and you can go down that list\n\n1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:23.460\n with the Chinese Communist Party,\n\n1:37:23.460 --> 1:37:25.460\n and you can go down the list, you know,\n\n1:37:25.460 --> 1:37:30.460\n with others who are threatening, you know, with Ethiopia\n\n1:37:31.300 --> 1:37:33.860\n and what it's doing in Tigray.\n\n1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:37.900\n And, you know, you can go down that list and start pushing.\n\n1:37:37.900 --> 1:37:39.220\n I think what happened,\n\n1:37:39.220 --> 1:37:44.220\n you know, there was more of a willingness in the 90s,\n\n1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:47.660\n and in, you know, right at the turn of the century,\n\n1:37:48.860 --> 1:37:50.780\n you know, to do these kinds of things.\n\n1:37:50.780 --> 1:37:53.260\n And then, you know, when Trump got elected and, you know,\n\n1:37:53.260 --> 1:37:55.380\n he basically said, you know, America first\n\n1:37:55.380 --> 1:37:56.260\n and out of the world,\n\n1:37:56.260 --> 1:37:58.620\n we're not gonna do any of this kind of stuff.\n\n1:37:58.620 --> 1:38:00.780\n And now Biden has the problem\n\n1:38:00.780 --> 1:38:02.460\n of trying to rebuild consensus\n\n1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:06.740\n on how you deal with these kinds of things.\n\n1:38:06.740 --> 1:38:08.660\n I think it's not impossible.\n\n1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:12.500\n I mean, here I tend to be maybe more of an optimist than you.\n\n1:38:12.500 --> 1:38:14.540\n You know, I think it's not impossible\n\n1:38:14.540 --> 1:38:16.700\n that the international community can, you know,\n\n1:38:16.700 --> 1:38:20.620\n muster some internal fortitude\n\n1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:25.620\n and push harder, short of war, you know,\n\n1:38:25.660 --> 1:38:30.660\n to get the Chinese and to get the, again, Myanmar,\n\n1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:34.100\n and to get others to kind of back off\n\n1:38:34.100 --> 1:38:36.020\n of violations of people's rights\n\n1:38:36.020 --> 1:38:38.300\n the way they are routinely doing it.\n\n1:38:38.300 --> 1:38:39.980\n So that's in the space of geopolitics.\n\n1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:42.820\n That's the space of politicians and UN and so on.\n\n1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:44.420\n The interesting thing about China,\n\n1:38:44.420 --> 1:38:47.020\n and this is a difficult topic,\n\n1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:52.020\n but there's so many financial interests\n\n1:38:53.540 --> 1:38:58.540\n that not many voices with power and with money\n\n1:38:59.380 --> 1:39:02.340\n speak up, speak out against China\n\n1:39:03.460 --> 1:39:06.700\n because it's a very interesting effect\n\n1:39:06.700 --> 1:39:11.140\n because it costs a lot for an individual to speak up\n\n1:39:12.260 --> 1:39:13.820\n because you're going to suffer.\n\n1:39:13.820 --> 1:39:16.980\n I mean, China just cuts off the market.\n\n1:39:16.980 --> 1:39:19.980\n Like if you have a product, if you have a company\n\n1:39:19.980 --> 1:39:22.780\n and you say something negative, China just says, okay,\n\n1:39:22.780 --> 1:39:25.100\n well then they knock you out of the market.\n\n1:39:25.100 --> 1:39:27.420\n And so any person that speaks up,\n\n1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:29.780\n they get shut down immediately financially.\n\n1:39:29.780 --> 1:39:33.180\n It's a huge cost, sometimes millions or billions of dollars.\n\n1:39:33.180 --> 1:39:36.540\n And so what happens is everybody of consequences,\n\n1:39:36.540 --> 1:39:39.540\n sort of financially, everybody with a giant platform\n\n1:39:39.540 --> 1:39:41.260\n is extremely hesitant to speak out.\n\n1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:45.260\n It's a very, it's a different kind of hesitation\n\n1:39:45.260 --> 1:39:46.820\n that's financial in nature.\n\n1:39:46.820 --> 1:39:48.700\n I don't know if that was always the case.\n\n1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:52.380\n It seems like in history, people were quiet\n\n1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:55.860\n because of fear, because of a threat of violence.\n\n1:39:55.860 --> 1:39:58.380\n Here, there's almost like a self interested\n\n1:39:59.940 --> 1:40:04.300\n preservation of financial, of wealth.\n\n1:40:04.300 --> 1:40:06.220\n And I don't know what to do that.\n\n1:40:06.220 --> 1:40:09.380\n I mean, I don't know if you can say something there,\n\n1:40:09.380 --> 1:40:14.380\n like the genocide going on\n\n1:40:14.380 --> 1:40:17.340\n because people are financially self interested.\n\n1:40:18.340 --> 1:40:21.980\n Yeah, no, I think, I mean, I think the analysis is correct.\n\n1:40:21.980 --> 1:40:26.100\n And it's not only, but it's not only corporations,\n\n1:40:26.100 --> 1:40:28.180\n but it's the American government\n\n1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:30.300\n that represents the American people\n\n1:40:30.300 --> 1:40:35.300\n that also feels compelled not to challenge the Chinese\n\n1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:39.300\n on human rights issues.\n\n1:40:39.300 --> 1:40:41.900\n But the interesting thing is it's not just,\n\n1:40:41.900 --> 1:40:44.340\n you know, I know a lot of people from China\n\n1:40:44.340 --> 1:40:47.060\n and first of all, amazing human beings\n\n1:40:47.060 --> 1:40:49.020\n and a lot of brilliant people in China,\n\n1:40:49.020 --> 1:40:50.860\n they also don't want to speak out\n\n1:40:50.860 --> 1:40:52.980\n and not because they're sort of quote unquote,\n\n1:40:52.980 --> 1:40:56.140\n like silenced, but more because they're going\n\n1:40:56.140 --> 1:40:58.500\n to also lose financially.\n\n1:40:58.500 --> 1:41:00.580\n They have a lot of businesses in China.\n\n1:41:00.580 --> 1:41:02.500\n They, you know, they're running,\n\n1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:06.700\n in fact, the Chinese government and the country\n\n1:41:06.700 --> 1:41:08.460\n has a very interesting structure\n\n1:41:08.460 --> 1:41:11.340\n because it has a lot of elements that enable capitalism\n\n1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:13.820\n within a certain framework.\n\n1:41:13.820 --> 1:41:16.540\n So you have a lot of very successful companies\n\n1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:18.180\n and they operate successfully.\n\n1:41:18.180 --> 1:41:19.900\n And then the leaders of those companies,\n\n1:41:19.900 --> 1:41:24.620\n many of whom have either been on this podcast,\n\n1:41:24.620 --> 1:41:25.900\n or want to be on this podcast,\n\n1:41:25.900 --> 1:41:28.180\n they really don't want to say anything negative\n\n1:41:28.180 --> 1:41:29.380\n about the government.\n\n1:41:29.380 --> 1:41:32.740\n And the nature of the fear I sense\n\n1:41:32.740 --> 1:41:37.300\n is not the kind of fear you would have in Nazi Germany.\n\n1:41:37.300 --> 1:41:40.180\n It's a very kind of, it's a mellow,\n\n1:41:40.180 --> 1:41:44.940\n like why would I speak out when it has a negative effect\n\n1:41:44.940 --> 1:41:47.460\n on my company, on my family, in terms of finance,\n\n1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:48.660\n strictly financially.\n\n1:41:50.060 --> 1:41:53.860\n And that's difficult.\n\n1:41:53.860 --> 1:41:56.020\n That's a different problem to solve.\n\n1:41:56.020 --> 1:41:57.620\n That feels solvable.\n\n1:41:57.620 --> 1:42:00.060\n It feels like it's a money problem.\n\n1:42:00.060 --> 1:42:02.300\n If you can control the flow of money\n\n1:42:03.940 --> 1:42:05.580\n where the government has less power\n\n1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:06.780\n to control the flow of money,\n\n1:42:06.780 --> 1:42:08.740\n it feels like that's solvable.\n\n1:42:08.740 --> 1:42:10.300\n And that's where capitalism is good.\n\n1:42:10.300 --> 1:42:11.540\n That's where a free market is good.\n\n1:42:11.540 --> 1:42:13.180\n So it's like, that's where a lot of people\n\n1:42:13.180 --> 1:42:14.380\n in the cryptocurrency space,\n\n1:42:14.380 --> 1:42:15.980\n I don't know if you follow them,\n\n1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:19.660\n they kind of say, okay, take the monetary system,\n\n1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:22.500\n the power to control money away from governments.\n\n1:42:22.500 --> 1:42:23.420\n Make it a distributed,\n\n1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:26.300\n like allow technology to help you with that.\n\n1:42:26.300 --> 1:42:28.700\n That's a hopeful message there.\n\n1:42:28.700 --> 1:42:29.980\n In fact, a lot of people argue\n\n1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:31.940\n that kind of Bitcoin and these cryptocurrencies\n\n1:42:31.940 --> 1:42:36.940\n can help deal with some of these authoritarian regimes\n\n1:42:38.460 --> 1:42:41.860\n that lead to violations of basic human rights.\n\n1:42:41.860 --> 1:42:44.300\n If you can control, if you can give the power\n\n1:42:44.300 --> 1:42:46.060\n to control the money to the people,\n\n1:42:46.060 --> 1:42:47.940\n you can take that away from governments.\n\n1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:49.700\n That's another source of hope\n\n1:42:49.700 --> 1:42:52.740\n where technology might be able to do something good.\n\n1:42:52.740 --> 1:42:54.820\n That's something different about the 21st century\n\n1:42:54.820 --> 1:42:57.100\n than the 20th is there's technology\n\n1:42:57.100 --> 1:42:59.700\n in the hands of billions of people.\n\n1:42:59.700 --> 1:43:01.700\n I mean, I have to say,\n\n1:43:01.700 --> 1:43:04.660\n I think you're a naive when it comes to technology.\n\n1:43:04.660 --> 1:43:07.900\n I mean, I don't, I'm not someone who understands technology.\n\n1:43:07.900 --> 1:43:11.620\n So it's wrong of me to argue with you\n\n1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:13.820\n because I don't really spend much time with it.\n\n1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:15.940\n I don't really like it very much.\n\n1:43:15.940 --> 1:43:20.940\n And I'm not, I'm neither a fan nor a connoisseur.\n\n1:43:21.060 --> 1:43:23.860\n So I just don't really know.\n\n1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:27.700\n But what human history has shown basically,\n\n1:43:27.700 --> 1:43:28.980\n and that's a big statement.\n\n1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:31.020\n I don't wanna pretend I can tell you\n\n1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:32.860\n what human history has shown.\n\n1:43:32.860 --> 1:43:37.180\n But technology, atom bomb,\n\n1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:39.780\n I mean, that's a perfect example of technology.\n\n1:43:39.780 --> 1:43:42.100\n What happens when you discover new things?\n\n1:43:42.100 --> 1:43:43.300\n It's a perfect example.\n\n1:43:43.300 --> 1:43:45.020\n What's going on with Facebook now?\n\n1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:47.980\n It's an absolutely perfect example.\n\n1:43:47.980 --> 1:43:52.260\n And I once went to a lecture by Eric Schmidt\n\n1:43:52.260 --> 1:43:54.700\n about the future and about all the things\n\n1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:57.060\n that were gonna happen and all these wonderful things\n\n1:43:57.060 --> 1:43:59.860\n like you wouldn't have to translate yourself anything,\n\n1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:02.780\n you wouldn't have to read a book,\n\n1:44:02.780 --> 1:44:04.140\n you wouldn't have to drive a car,\n\n1:44:04.140 --> 1:44:05.660\n you don't have to do this, you don't have to do that.\n\n1:44:05.660 --> 1:44:07.340\n What kind of life is that?\n\n1:44:07.340 --> 1:44:12.020\n So my view of technology is it's subsumed\n\n1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:18.140\n to the political, social and moral needs of our day\n\n1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:20.340\n and should be subsumed to that day.\n\n1:44:20.340 --> 1:44:22.340\n It's not gonna solve anything by itself.\n\n1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:25.460\n It's gonna be you and me that solve things.\n\n1:44:25.460 --> 1:44:27.420\n If they're solved, there are political system\n\n1:44:27.420 --> 1:44:28.380\n that solve things.\n\n1:44:28.380 --> 1:44:31.420\n Technology is neutral on one level.\n\n1:44:31.420 --> 1:44:35.060\n It is simply a human, I mean, they're talking now\n\n1:44:35.060 --> 1:44:38.180\n about how artificial intelligence is gonna do this\n\n1:44:38.180 --> 1:44:39.780\n and is gonna do that.\n\n1:44:39.780 --> 1:44:43.620\n I'm not so sure there's anything necessarily positive\n\n1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:46.220\n or negative about it except it does obviously\n\n1:44:46.220 --> 1:44:48.660\n make work easier and things like that.\n\n1:44:48.660 --> 1:44:53.660\n I mean, I like email and I like word processing\n\n1:44:53.940 --> 1:44:56.180\n and all that stuff is great,\n\n1:44:56.180 --> 1:45:01.180\n but actually solving human relations in and of itself\n\n1:45:04.420 --> 1:45:09.420\n or international relations or conflict among human beings.\n\n1:45:11.580 --> 1:45:14.860\n I mean, I see technology as causing as many problems\n\n1:45:14.860 --> 1:45:18.460\n as it solves and maybe even more.\n\n1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:19.300\n You know, the kind.\n\n1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:20.140\n Maybe.\n\n1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:20.980\n Maybe even more. Maybe.\n\n1:45:20.980 --> 1:45:21.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:21.820 --> 1:45:25.220\n The question is, so like you said, technology is neutral.\n\n1:45:25.220 --> 1:45:26.900\n I agree with this.\n\n1:45:26.900 --> 1:45:31.900\n Technology is a toolkit, is a tool set that enables humans\n\n1:45:32.460 --> 1:45:36.700\n to have wider reach and more power, the printing press.\n\n1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:41.380\n The rare reason I can read your books is I would argue,\n\n1:45:41.380 --> 1:45:45.540\n so first of all, the printing press and then the internet.\n\n1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:50.540\n Wikipedia, I think, has immeasurable effect on humanity.\n\n1:45:52.020 --> 1:45:53.900\n Technology is a double edged sword.\n\n1:45:53.900 --> 1:45:57.260\n It allows bad people to do bad things\n\n1:45:57.260 --> 1:45:58.780\n and good people to do good things.\n\n1:45:58.780 --> 1:46:02.780\n It ultimately boils down to the people\n\n1:46:02.780 --> 1:46:05.700\n and whether you believe the capacity for good\n\n1:46:05.700 --> 1:46:07.460\n outweighs the capacity of bad.\n\n1:46:07.460 --> 1:46:09.820\n And so you said that I'm naive.\n\n1:46:09.820 --> 1:46:10.660\n It is true.\n\n1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:12.340\n I'm naively optimistic.\n\n1:46:12.340 --> 1:46:16.020\n I would say you're naively cynical about technology.\n\n1:46:16.020 --> 1:46:20.460\n Here we have one overdressed naive optimist\n\n1:46:20.460 --> 1:46:23.780\n and one brilliant, but nevertheless,\n\n1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:27.060\n technologically naive cynic and we don't know.\n\n1:46:27.060 --> 1:46:30.340\n We don't know whether the capacity for good\n\n1:46:30.340 --> 1:46:34.860\n or the capacity for evil wins out in the end.\n\n1:46:34.860 --> 1:46:37.060\n And like we've been talking about,\n\n1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:39.940\n the trajectory of human history seems to pivot\n\n1:46:39.940 --> 1:46:43.060\n in a lot of random seeming moments.\n\n1:46:43.060 --> 1:46:45.020\n So we don't know.\n\n1:46:45.020 --> 1:46:50.020\n But as a builder of technology, I remain optimistic.\n\n1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:56.020\n And I should say kind of when you are optimistic,\n\n1:46:56.220 --> 1:47:01.060\n it is often easy to sound naive.\n\n1:47:02.780 --> 1:47:06.300\n And I'm not sure what to make of that small effect.\n\n1:47:06.300 --> 1:47:07.780\n Not to linger on specific words,\n\n1:47:07.780 --> 1:47:12.780\n but I've noticed that people who kind of are cynical\n\n1:47:13.540 --> 1:47:18.180\n about the world somehow sound more intelligent.\n\n1:47:18.180 --> 1:47:19.020\n No, no.\n\n1:47:19.020 --> 1:47:23.820\n The issue is how can you be realistic about the world?\n\n1:47:23.820 --> 1:47:25.780\n It's not optimistic or pessimistic.\n\n1:47:25.780 --> 1:47:27.260\n It's not cynical.\n\n1:47:27.260 --> 1:47:29.500\n The question is how can you be a realist, right?\n\n1:47:29.500 --> 1:47:31.140\n Yes, that's a good question.\n\n1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:38.140\n Realism depends on a combination of knowledge and wisdom\n\n1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:42.700\n and good instincts and that sort of thing.\n\n1:47:42.700 --> 1:47:47.340\n And that's what we strive for, is a kind of realism.\n\n1:47:47.340 --> 1:47:49.140\n We both strive for that kind of realism.\n\n1:47:49.140 --> 1:47:53.420\n But I mean, here's an example I would give you.\n\n1:47:53.420 --> 1:47:56.580\n What about, again, we've got this environmental issue,\n\n1:47:56.580 --> 1:47:59.300\n and technology has created it.\n\n1:47:59.300 --> 1:48:01.780\n It's created it.\n\n1:48:01.780 --> 1:48:04.140\n I mean, the growth of technology,\n\n1:48:04.140 --> 1:48:06.980\n I mean, we all like to be heated well in our homes,\n\n1:48:06.980 --> 1:48:11.980\n and we wanna have cars that run quickly and fast on gas.\n\n1:48:11.980 --> 1:48:16.980\n I mean, we're all consumers and we all profit from this.\n\n1:48:16.980 --> 1:48:20.060\n I don't, not everybody profits from it,\n\n1:48:20.060 --> 1:48:23.100\n but we wanna be comfortable.\n\n1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:25.580\n And technology has provided us with a comfortable life.\n\n1:48:25.580 --> 1:48:29.620\n And it's also provided us with this incredible danger,\n\n1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:32.180\n which it's not solving, at least not now.\n\n1:48:32.180 --> 1:48:34.820\n And it may solve, but it may, it's only,\n\n1:48:34.820 --> 1:48:37.700\n my view is, you know what's gonna happen?\n\n1:48:37.700 --> 1:48:39.340\n A horrible catastrophe.\n\n1:48:39.340 --> 1:48:42.260\n It's the only way, it's the only way\n\n1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:44.140\n we will direct ourselves\n\n1:48:44.140 --> 1:48:46.460\n to actually trying to do something about it.\n\n1:48:48.100 --> 1:48:53.100\n We don't have the wisdom and the realism\n\n1:48:53.100 --> 1:48:58.100\n and the sense of purpose, you know, what's her name?\n\n1:48:59.020 --> 1:49:01.580\n Greta goes blah, blah, blah, something like that\n\n1:49:01.580 --> 1:49:04.580\n in her last talk about the environmental summit\n\n1:49:08.020 --> 1:49:09.740\n in Glasgow or whatever it was.\n\n1:49:11.340 --> 1:49:15.900\n And, you know, we just don't have it\n\n1:49:15.900 --> 1:49:19.420\n unless we're hit upside the head really, really hard.\n\n1:49:19.420 --> 1:49:24.420\n And then maybe, you know, the business with nuclear weapons,\n\n1:49:25.460 --> 1:49:27.860\n you know, I think somehow we got hit upside the head\n\n1:49:27.860 --> 1:49:30.380\n and we realized, oh man, you know,\n\n1:49:30.380 --> 1:49:32.940\n this could really do it to the whole world.\n\n1:49:32.940 --> 1:49:36.660\n And so we started, you know, serious arms control stuff.\n\n1:49:36.660 --> 1:49:41.460\n And, you know, but up to that point, you know,\n\n1:49:41.460 --> 1:49:43.500\n I mean, there was just something about, you know,\n\n1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:46.060\n Khrushchev's big bomb, his big hydrogen bomb,\n\n1:49:46.060 --> 1:49:48.340\n which he exploded in the times,\n\n1:49:48.340 --> 1:49:50.420\n I think it was the anniversary or something like that.\n\n1:49:50.420 --> 1:49:52.460\n You know, I mean, just think what we could have done\n\n1:49:52.460 --> 1:49:53.580\n to each other.\n\n1:49:53.580 --> 1:49:55.620\n Well, that's the double edged sword of technology.\n\n1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:57.300\n Yeah, I agree, it's a double edged sword.\n\n1:49:57.300 --> 1:49:59.260\n There's a lot of people, there's a lot of people\n\n1:49:59.260 --> 1:50:01.980\n that argue that nuclear weapons is the reason\n\n1:50:01.980 --> 1:50:03.780\n we haven't had a World War III.\n\n1:50:03.780 --> 1:50:06.860\n So nuclear weapons, the mutually assured destruction\n\n1:50:06.860 --> 1:50:08.540\n leads to a kind of like,\n\n1:50:08.540 --> 1:50:11.220\n we've reached a certain level of destructiveness\n\n1:50:11.220 --> 1:50:15.660\n with our weapons where we were able to catch ourselves,\n\n1:50:15.660 --> 1:50:20.300\n not to create, like you said, hit really hard.\n\n1:50:20.300 --> 1:50:25.300\n This is the interesting question about kind of hard,\n\n1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:28.620\n hard and really hard upside the head.\n\n1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:31.620\n With the environment, I would argue,\n\n1:50:31.620 --> 1:50:33.860\n see, we can't know the future,\n\n1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:36.180\n but I would argue as the pressure builds,\n\n1:50:36.180 --> 1:50:41.180\n there's already, because of this created urgency,\n\n1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:44.580\n the amount of innovation that I've seen\n\n1:50:44.580 --> 1:50:47.180\n that sometimes is unrelated to the environment,\n\n1:50:47.180 --> 1:50:49.940\n but kind of sparked by this urgency,\n\n1:50:49.940 --> 1:50:52.940\n it's been humongous, including the work of Elon Musk,\n\n1:50:52.940 --> 1:50:54.980\n including the work of just,\n\n1:50:54.980 --> 1:50:59.980\n you could argue that the SpaceX\n\n1:51:00.580 --> 1:51:03.580\n and the new exploration of space is kind of sparked\n\n1:51:03.580 --> 1:51:06.020\n by this environmental like urgency.\n\n1:51:06.020 --> 1:51:07.940\n I mean, connected to Tesla and everything they're doing\n\n1:51:07.940 --> 1:51:09.740\n with electric vehicles and so on.\n\n1:51:09.740 --> 1:51:11.260\n There's a huge amount of innovation\n\n1:51:11.260 --> 1:51:12.660\n in the space that's happening.\n\n1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:16.660\n I could see the effect of climate change\n\n1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:19.780\n resulting in more positive innovation\n\n1:51:19.780 --> 1:51:22.700\n that improves the quality of life across the world\n\n1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:26.340\n than the actual catastrophic events that we're describing,\n\n1:51:26.340 --> 1:51:28.420\n which we cannot even currently predict.\n\n1:51:28.420 --> 1:51:29.620\n It's not like there's going to be,\n\n1:51:29.620 --> 1:51:31.540\n there's going to be more extreme weather events.\n\n1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:32.780\n What does that even mean?\n\n1:51:32.780 --> 1:51:35.260\n There's going to be a gradual increase\n\n1:51:35.260 --> 1:51:38.420\n of the level of water.\n\n1:51:38.420 --> 1:51:40.740\n What does that even mean in terms of catastrophic events?\n\n1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:42.260\n It's going to be pretty gradual.\n\n1:51:42.260 --> 1:51:43.460\n There's going to be migration.\n\n1:51:43.460 --> 1:51:45.100\n We can't predict what that means.\n\n1:51:45.100 --> 1:51:47.500\n And in response to that,\n\n1:51:47.500 --> 1:51:52.420\n there's going to be a huge amount of innovators born today\n\n1:51:52.420 --> 1:51:56.820\n that have dreams and that will build devices and inventions\n\n1:51:56.820 --> 1:52:01.700\n and from space to vehicles to in the software world\n\n1:52:01.700 --> 1:52:03.700\n that enable education across the world,\n\n1:52:03.700 --> 1:52:07.740\n all those kinds of things that will on mass, on average,\n\n1:52:07.740 --> 1:52:11.020\n increase the quality of life on average across the world.\n\n1:52:11.020 --> 1:52:14.500\n So it's not at all obvious that these,\n\n1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:16.220\n the things that the technologies\n\n1:52:16.220 --> 1:52:19.940\n that are creating climate change, global warming,\n\n1:52:19.940 --> 1:52:23.500\n are going to have a negative, net negative effect.\n\n1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:24.740\n We don't know this.\n\n1:52:24.740 --> 1:52:28.860\n And I'm kind of inspired by the dreamers,\n\n1:52:28.860 --> 1:52:32.780\n the engineers, the innovators and the entrepreneurs\n\n1:52:32.780 --> 1:52:36.380\n that build, that wake up in the morning,\n\n1:52:36.380 --> 1:52:38.340\n see problems in the world and dream\n\n1:52:38.340 --> 1:52:40.740\n that they're going to be the ones who solve those problems.\n\n1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:42.980\n That's the human spirit.\n\n1:52:42.980 --> 1:52:44.460\n And that I'm not exactly,\n\n1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:46.700\n it is true that we need those deadlines.\n\n1:52:46.700 --> 1:52:48.900\n We need to be freaking out about stuff.\n\n1:52:48.900 --> 1:52:52.060\n And the reason we need to study history\n\n1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:55.060\n and the worst of human history is then we can say,\n\n1:52:55.060 --> 1:52:56.980\n oh shit, this too can happen.\n\n1:52:57.900 --> 1:52:59.340\n It's a slap in the face.\n\n1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:01.380\n It's a wake up call that if you're,\n\n1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:03.580\n if you get complacent, if you get lazy,\n\n1:53:03.580 --> 1:53:04.820\n this is going to happen.\n\n1:53:04.820 --> 1:53:08.340\n And that, listen, there's a lot of really intelligent people,\n\n1:53:08.340 --> 1:53:10.660\n ambitious people, dreamers.\n\n1:53:10.660 --> 1:53:14.740\n Skilled dreamers that build solutions\n\n1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:17.180\n that make sure this stuff doesn't happen anymore.\n\n1:53:17.180 --> 1:53:19.740\n So there's, I think there's reason to be optimistic\n\n1:53:19.740 --> 1:53:21.780\n about technology, not in a naive way.\n\n1:53:21.780 --> 1:53:25.380\n There's an argument to be made in a realistic way\n\n1:53:25.380 --> 1:53:29.220\n that like with technology, we can build a better future.\n\n1:53:29.220 --> 1:53:33.300\n And then Facebook is a lesson in the way Facebook\n\n1:53:33.300 --> 1:53:37.220\n has been done is a lesson how not to do it.\n\n1:53:37.220 --> 1:53:42.220\n And that lesson serves as a guide\n\n1:53:42.420 --> 1:53:44.380\n of how to do it better, how to do it right,\n\n1:53:44.380 --> 1:53:46.540\n how to do it in a positive way.\n\n1:53:46.540 --> 1:53:49.980\n And the same, every single sort of failed technology\n\n1:53:49.980 --> 1:53:53.260\n contains within it the lessons of how to do it better.\n\n1:53:53.260 --> 1:53:55.380\n And I mean, without that,\n\n1:53:56.660 --> 1:54:00.620\n what's the source of hope for human civilization?\n\n1:54:00.620 --> 1:54:05.620\n You know, that, I mean, by way of question,\n\n1:54:05.620 --> 1:54:09.300\n you have truly studied some of the darkest moments\n\n1:54:09.300 --> 1:54:10.300\n in human history.\n\n1:54:11.620 --> 1:54:13.220\n Put on your optimist hat.\n\n1:54:14.380 --> 1:54:15.220\n Where?\n\n1:54:15.220 --> 1:54:16.060\n That one.\n\n1:54:16.060 --> 1:54:16.900\n Yes.\n\n1:54:16.900 --> 1:54:19.660\n There are glimmers of it.\n\n1:54:19.660 --> 1:54:22.300\n Yes, what is your source of hope\n\n1:54:22.300 --> 1:54:24.620\n for the future of human civilization?\n\n1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:31.020\n Well, I think it resides in, you know,\n\n1:54:31.100 --> 1:54:32.460\n some of what you've been saying,\n\n1:54:32.460 --> 1:54:37.460\n which is the, in the persistence of this civilization\n\n1:54:37.700 --> 1:54:42.700\n over time, despite, you know, the incredible setbacks,\n\n1:54:43.180 --> 1:54:45.820\n you know, two enormous world wars, you know,\n\n1:54:45.820 --> 1:54:50.500\n the nuclear standoff, the, you know,\n\n1:54:50.500 --> 1:54:52.740\n the horrible things we're experiencing now\n\n1:54:52.740 --> 1:54:56.060\n with climate change and migration and stuff like that,\n\n1:54:56.060 --> 1:54:58.820\n that despite these things, you know,\n\n1:54:58.820 --> 1:55:02.420\n we are persisting and we are continuing.\n\n1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:04.580\n And like you say, we're continuing to invent\n\n1:55:04.580 --> 1:55:07.700\n and we're continuing to try to solve these problems.\n\n1:55:07.700 --> 1:55:11.300\n And, you know, we're continuing to love as well as hate.\n\n1:55:11.300 --> 1:55:16.300\n And, you know, that, you know, I'm basically,\n\n1:55:17.740 --> 1:55:20.380\n I mean, I have children and grandchildren\n\n1:55:20.380 --> 1:55:23.780\n and I think they're gonna be just fine.\n\n1:55:23.780 --> 1:55:27.700\n You know, I'm not a doom and gloomer, you know,\n\n1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:30.300\n I'm not a Cassandra saying the world is coming to an end.\n\n1:55:30.300 --> 1:55:33.500\n I'm not like that at all, you know,\n\n1:55:33.500 --> 1:55:38.260\n I think that, you know, things will persist.\n\n1:55:38.260 --> 1:55:41.380\n Another, by the way, source of tremendous optimism\n\n1:55:41.380 --> 1:55:45.580\n on my part, the kids I teach, you know,\n\n1:55:45.580 --> 1:55:49.140\n I teach some unbelievably fantastic young people,\n\n1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:51.580\n you know, who are sort of like you say,\n\n1:55:51.580 --> 1:55:54.260\n they're dreamers and they're problem solvers\n\n1:55:54.260 --> 1:56:01.260\n and they're, I mean, they have enormously humane values\n\n1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:02.980\n and ways of thinking about the world\n\n1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:05.740\n and they wanna do good.\n\n1:56:05.740 --> 1:56:07.460\n You know, if you take the kind of,\n\n1:56:08.460 --> 1:56:11.900\n I mean, this has probably been true all the way along,\n\n1:56:11.900 --> 1:56:14.820\n but I mean, the percentage of do gooders,\n\n1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:16.740\n you know, is really enormously large.\n\n1:56:16.740 --> 1:56:18.100\n Now, whether they end up working\n\n1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:20.740\n for some kind of shark law firm or something,\n\n1:56:20.740 --> 1:56:24.900\n you know, or, you know, that kind of thing,\n\n1:56:24.900 --> 1:56:26.780\n or whether they end up human rights lawyers\n\n1:56:26.780 --> 1:56:28.380\n is they all wanna be, right?\n\n1:56:28.380 --> 1:56:33.380\n You know, is a different kind of question,\n\n1:56:33.700 --> 1:56:38.180\n but certainly, you know, these young people are talented,\n\n1:56:38.180 --> 1:56:41.100\n they're smart, they have wonderful values,\n\n1:56:41.100 --> 1:56:44.100\n they're energetic, they work hard, you know,\n\n1:56:44.100 --> 1:56:48.860\n they're focused and of course, it's not just Stanford.\n\n1:56:48.860 --> 1:56:50.300\n I mean, it's all over the country,\n\n1:56:50.300 --> 1:56:52.540\n you know, you have young people\n\n1:56:52.540 --> 1:56:55.940\n who really wanna contribute and they wanna contribute.\n\n1:56:55.940 --> 1:56:58.900\n I mean, it's true some of them end up,\n\n1:56:58.900 --> 1:57:02.100\n you know, working to get rich.\n\n1:57:02.100 --> 1:57:03.700\n I mean, that's inevitable, right?\n\n1:57:03.700 --> 1:57:07.460\n But the percentages are actually rather small,\n\n1:57:07.460 --> 1:57:08.780\n at least at this age, you know,\n\n1:57:08.780 --> 1:57:10.660\n maybe when they get a mortgage and a family\n\n1:57:10.660 --> 1:57:12.780\n and that sort of thing, you know,\n\n1:57:13.820 --> 1:57:16.260\n financial wellbeing will be more important to them.\n\n1:57:16.260 --> 1:57:19.980\n But right now, you know, you catch this young generation\n\n1:57:19.980 --> 1:57:22.060\n and they're fantastic, they're fantastic.\n\n1:57:22.060 --> 1:57:26.220\n And they're not what they're often portrayed as being,\n\n1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:30.980\n you know, kind of silly and naive and knee jerk leftists\n\n1:57:30.980 --> 1:57:33.620\n and that, they're not at all like that.\n\n1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:36.700\n You know, they're really fine young people.\n\n1:57:36.700 --> 1:57:40.380\n So that's a source of optimism to me too.\n\n1:57:40.380 --> 1:57:43.980\n What advice would you give to those young people today,\n\n1:57:43.980 --> 1:57:47.100\n maybe in high school, in college, at Stanford,\n\n1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:52.100\n maybe to your grandchildren about how to have a career\n\n1:57:52.380 --> 1:57:55.500\n they can be proud of, have a life they can be proud of?\n\n1:57:55.500 --> 1:57:58.540\n Pursue careers that are in the public interest,\n\n1:57:58.540 --> 1:58:00.020\n you know, in one fashion or another\n\n1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:02.340\n and not just in their interests.\n\n1:58:03.900 --> 1:58:07.100\n And that would be, I mean, it's not bad to pursue a career\n\n1:58:07.100 --> 1:58:08.020\n in your own interests.\n\n1:58:08.020 --> 1:58:11.060\n I mean, as long as it's something that's useful\n\n1:58:11.060 --> 1:58:16.060\n and positive for their families or whatever.\n\n1:58:16.060 --> 1:58:19.860\n But yeah, so I mean, I try to advise kids\n\n1:58:19.860 --> 1:58:24.380\n to find themselves somehow, you know, find who they wanna be\n\n1:58:24.380 --> 1:58:27.100\n and what they wanna be and try to pursue it.\n\n1:58:27.100 --> 1:58:30.140\n And the NGO world is growing, as you know,\n\n1:58:30.140 --> 1:58:34.420\n and a lot of young people are kind of throwing themselves\n\n1:58:34.420 --> 1:58:39.420\n into it and, you know, human rights watch\n\n1:58:39.820 --> 1:58:41.020\n and that kind of stuff.\n\n1:58:41.020 --> 1:58:43.340\n And, you know, they wanna do that kind of work\n\n1:58:43.340 --> 1:58:46.940\n and it's very admirable.\n\n1:58:46.940 --> 1:58:50.700\n I tend to think that even if you're not working\n\n1:58:50.700 --> 1:58:53.580\n in human rights, there's a certain way in which\n\n1:58:53.580 --> 1:58:58.580\n if you live with integrity, I believe that all of us\n\n1:59:01.300 --> 1:59:05.860\n or many of us have a bunch of moments in our lives\n\n1:59:05.860 --> 1:59:07.980\n when we're posed with a decision.\n\n1:59:07.980 --> 1:59:09.300\n It's a quiet one.\n\n1:59:09.300 --> 1:59:12.340\n Maybe it'll never be written about or talked about.\n\n1:59:12.340 --> 1:59:17.340\n But you get to choose whether you, there's a choice\n\n1:59:17.340 --> 1:59:22.340\n that is difficult to make, it may require sacrifice,\n\n1:59:22.580 --> 1:59:27.140\n but it's the choice that the best version\n\n1:59:27.140 --> 1:59:28.780\n of that person would make.\n\n1:59:29.860 --> 1:59:31.420\n That's the best way I can sort of say\n\n1:59:31.420 --> 1:59:32.540\n how to act with integrity.\n\n1:59:32.540 --> 1:59:35.260\n It's the very thing that would resist the early days\n\n1:59:35.260 --> 1:59:36.180\n in Nazi Germany.\n\n1:59:36.180 --> 1:59:40.260\n It sounds dramatic to say, but those little actions.\n\n1:59:40.260 --> 1:59:43.940\n And I feel like the best you can do\n\n1:59:43.940 --> 1:59:47.940\n to avoid genocide on scale is for all of us\n\n1:59:47.940 --> 1:59:51.860\n to live in that way, within those moments,\n\n1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:55.460\n unrelated potentially to human rights, to anything else,\n\n1:59:55.460 --> 1:59:57.420\n is to take those actions.\n\n1:59:57.420 --> 2:00:00.420\n Like I believe that all of us know the right thing to do.\n\n2:00:00.420 --> 2:00:01.500\n I know that's right.\n\n2:00:01.500 --> 2:00:02.700\n I think that's right.\n\n2:00:02.700 --> 2:00:04.020\n You put it very well.\n\n2:00:04.020 --> 2:00:06.660\n I couldn't have done it better myself.\n\n2:00:06.660 --> 2:00:07.940\n No, no, I agree.\n\n2:00:07.940 --> 2:00:12.940\n I agree completely that there are, to live with truth,\n\n2:00:13.980 --> 2:00:17.300\n which is what V\u00e1clav Havel used to say,\n\n2:00:17.300 --> 2:00:21.100\n this famous Czech dissident talked about living in truth,\n\n2:00:21.100 --> 2:00:23.100\n but also to live with integrity.\n\n2:00:24.980 --> 2:00:26.860\n And that's really super important.\n\n2:00:27.780 --> 2:00:29.140\n Well, let me ask you about love.\n\n2:00:29.140 --> 2:00:31.300\n What role does love play in this whole thing\n\n2:00:31.300 --> 2:00:33.260\n in the human condition?\n\n2:00:33.260 --> 2:00:35.340\n In all of the study of genocide,\n\n2:00:35.340 --> 2:00:39.220\n it does seem that hardship in moments\n\n2:00:39.220 --> 2:00:41.260\n brings out the best in human nature\n\n2:00:41.260 --> 2:00:44.340\n and the best in human nature is expressed through love.\n\n2:00:44.340 --> 2:00:46.180\n Well, as I already mentioned to you,\n\n2:00:46.180 --> 2:00:51.180\n I think hardship is not a good thing for,\n\n2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:53.980\n you know, it's not the best thing for love.\n\n2:00:53.980 --> 2:00:57.700\n I mean, it's better to not have to suffer\n\n2:00:57.700 --> 2:01:00.940\n and not have to, yes, I think it is.\n\n2:01:00.940 --> 2:01:05.700\n I think it's, you know, as I mentioned to you,\n\n2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:08.340\n you know, studying concentration camps,\n\n2:01:08.340 --> 2:01:10.460\n you know, this is not a place for love.\n\n2:01:10.460 --> 2:01:13.780\n It happens, it happens,\n\n2:01:13.780 --> 2:01:15.260\n but it's not really a place for love.\n\n2:01:15.260 --> 2:01:16.660\n It's a place for rape.\n\n2:01:16.660 --> 2:01:19.380\n It's a place for torture.\n\n2:01:19.380 --> 2:01:20.460\n It's a place for killing.\n\n2:01:20.460 --> 2:01:25.460\n And it's a place for inhuman action one to another,\n\n2:01:25.500 --> 2:01:27.860\n you know, and also, as I said,\n\n2:01:27.860 --> 2:01:30.500\n among those who are suffering,\n\n2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:33.140\n not just between those who are,\n\n2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:34.820\n and then there are whole gradations,\n\n2:01:34.820 --> 2:01:36.340\n you know, the same thing in the gulag.\n\n2:01:36.340 --> 2:01:38.260\n You know, there are gradations all the way\n\n2:01:38.260 --> 2:01:41.020\n from the criminal prisoners\n\n2:01:41.020 --> 2:01:42.940\n who beat the hell out of the political prisoners,\n\n2:01:42.940 --> 2:01:44.900\n you know, who then have others below them\n\n2:01:44.900 --> 2:01:46.020\n who they beat down, you know,\n\n2:01:46.020 --> 2:01:48.460\n so everybody's being the hell out of everybody else.\n\n2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:53.380\n So I would not idealize in any way suffering as,\n\n2:01:53.380 --> 2:01:57.260\n you know, a source of beauty and love.\n\n2:01:57.260 --> 2:01:58.100\n I wouldn't do that at all.\n\n2:01:58.100 --> 2:02:00.700\n I think it's a whole lot better\n\n2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:03.220\n for people to be relatively prosperous.\n\n2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:04.820\n I'm not saying super prosperous,\n\n2:02:04.820 --> 2:02:06.380\n but to be able to feed themselves\n\n2:02:06.380 --> 2:02:08.260\n and to be able to feed their families\n\n2:02:08.260 --> 2:02:13.140\n and house their families and take care of themselves,\n\n2:02:14.820 --> 2:02:19.820\n you know, to foster loving relations between people.\n\n2:02:21.140 --> 2:02:24.980\n And, you know, I think it's no accident\n\n2:02:24.980 --> 2:02:29.980\n that, you know, poor families have much worse records\n\n2:02:31.940 --> 2:02:34.580\n when it comes to crime and things like that, you know,\n\n2:02:34.580 --> 2:02:39.580\n and also to wife beating and to child abuse\n\n2:02:39.820 --> 2:02:40.820\n and stuff like that.\n\n2:02:40.820 --> 2:02:45.820\n I mean, you just, you don't want to be poor and indigent\n\n2:02:46.580 --> 2:02:49.420\n and not have a roof over your head, be homeless.\n\n2:02:49.420 --> 2:02:51.420\n I mean, it doesn't mean, again, you know,\n\n2:02:51.420 --> 2:02:53.300\n homeless people are mean people.\n\n2:02:53.300 --> 2:02:54.580\n That's not what I'm trying to say.\n\n2:02:54.580 --> 2:02:56.940\n What I'm trying to say is that, you know,\n\n2:02:56.940 --> 2:02:59.060\n what we want to try to foster in this country\n\n2:02:59.060 --> 2:03:02.380\n and around the world, and one of the reasons, you know,\n\n2:03:03.660 --> 2:03:07.180\n I mean, I'm very critical of the Chinese in a lot of ways,\n\n2:03:07.180 --> 2:03:09.260\n but I mean, we have to remember they pulled that country\n\n2:03:09.260 --> 2:03:11.100\n out of horrible poverty, right?\n\n2:03:11.100 --> 2:03:14.540\n And I mean, there's still poor people in the countryside.\n\n2:03:14.540 --> 2:03:16.620\n There's still problems, you know,\n\n2:03:16.620 --> 2:03:21.620\n with want and need among the Chinese people.\n\n2:03:21.620 --> 2:03:24.380\n But, you know, there were millions and millions of Chinese\n\n2:03:24.380 --> 2:03:26.540\n who were living at the bare minimum of life,\n\n2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:28.260\n which is no way to live, you know,\n\n2:03:28.260 --> 2:03:31.300\n and no way, again, to foster love and compassion\n\n2:03:31.300 --> 2:03:33.820\n and getting along.\n\n2:03:33.820 --> 2:03:37.740\n So I want to be clear, I don't speak for history, right?\n\n2:03:37.740 --> 2:03:41.140\n I'm giving you, there used to be historians,\n\n2:03:41.140 --> 2:03:43.000\n you know, in the 19th century who really thought\n\n2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.500\n they were speaking for history, you know?\n\n2:03:45.500 --> 2:03:47.020\n I don't think that way at all.\n\n2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:49.540\n I mean, I understand I'm a subjective human being\n\n2:03:49.540 --> 2:03:54.020\n with my own points of view and my own opinions, but.\n\n2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:56.120\n I'm trying to remember this in this conversation\n\n2:03:56.120 --> 2:03:58.900\n that you're, despite the fact that you're brilliant\n\n2:03:58.900 --> 2:04:00.640\n and you've written brilliant books,\n\n2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:04.300\n that you're just human with an opinion.\n\n2:04:04.300 --> 2:04:07.060\n That's it, yeah, no, no, that's absolutely true.\n\n2:04:07.060 --> 2:04:09.660\n And I tell my students that too.\n\n2:04:09.660 --> 2:04:11.240\n I mean, I make sure they understand\n\n2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:12.940\n this is not history speaking, you know,\n\n2:04:12.940 --> 2:04:15.780\n this is me and Norman and I'm, you know,\n\n2:04:15.780 --> 2:04:18.420\n and this is what it's about.\n\n2:04:18.420 --> 2:04:21.100\n I mean, I spent a long time studying history\n\n2:04:21.100 --> 2:04:24.940\n and have enjoyed it enormously.\n\n2:04:24.940 --> 2:04:29.460\n But, you know, I'm an individual with my points of view.\n\n2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:33.140\n And one of them is that I've developed over time,\n\n2:04:34.100 --> 2:04:39.100\n is that, you know, human want is a real tragedy for people\n\n2:04:40.180 --> 2:04:44.260\n and it hurts people and it also causes upheavals\n\n2:04:44.260 --> 2:04:45.720\n and difficulties and stuff.\n\n2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:49.500\n So I feel for people, you know, I feel for people in Syria,\n\n2:04:49.500 --> 2:04:54.500\n I feel for people in, you know, in Ethiopia, in Tigray,\n\n2:04:54.580 --> 2:04:56.260\n you know, when they don't have enough to eat.\n\n2:04:56.260 --> 2:04:58.500\n And, you know, what that does, I mean,\n\n2:04:58.500 --> 2:05:00.540\n it doesn't mean they don't love each other, right?\n\n2:05:00.540 --> 2:05:03.020\n And it doesn't mean they don't love their kids.\n\n2:05:03.020 --> 2:05:06.620\n But it does mean that it's harder, you know, to do that.\n\n2:05:06.620 --> 2:05:08.420\n And to, and...\n\n2:05:08.420 --> 2:05:11.220\n I'm not so sure, it's obvious to me that it's harder.\n\n2:05:11.220 --> 2:05:13.260\n It's, there's suffering, there is suffering.\n\n2:05:13.260 --> 2:05:16.580\n But the numbers, we've been talking about deaths,\n\n2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:17.820\n we've been talking about suffering,\n\n2:05:17.820 --> 2:05:19.980\n but the numbers we're not quantifying.\n\n2:05:19.980 --> 2:05:22.740\n The history that you haven't perhaps been looking at\n\n2:05:22.740 --> 2:05:24.660\n is all the times that people have fallen in love,\n\n2:05:24.660 --> 2:05:27.940\n deeply with friends, with romantic love,\n\n2:05:27.940 --> 2:05:31.460\n the positive emotion that people have felt.\n\n2:05:31.460 --> 2:05:34.320\n And I'm not so sure that amidst the suffering,\n\n2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:36.700\n those moments of beauty and love can be discovered.\n\n2:05:36.700 --> 2:05:38.340\n And if we look at the numbers,\n\n2:05:38.340 --> 2:05:41.020\n I'm not so sure the story is obvious.\n\n2:05:41.020 --> 2:05:43.700\n That, you know, I mean, again,\n\n2:05:43.700 --> 2:05:46.860\n I suppose you may disagree with Viktor Frankl.\n\n2:05:46.860 --> 2:05:49.540\n I may too, maybe depending on the day.\n\n2:05:49.540 --> 2:05:52.540\n I mean, he says that if there's meaning to this life at all,\n\n2:05:52.540 --> 2:05:53.940\n there's meaning to the suffering too,\n\n2:05:53.940 --> 2:05:56.220\n because suffering is part of life.\n\n2:05:56.220 --> 2:06:01.220\n There's something about accepting the ups and downs,\n\n2:06:01.660 --> 2:06:03.820\n even when the downs go very low.\n\n2:06:03.820 --> 2:06:07.780\n And within all of it, finding a source of meaning.\n\n2:06:07.780 --> 2:06:09.880\n I mean, he's arguing from the perspective of psychology,\n\n2:06:09.880 --> 2:06:13.420\n but just this life is an incredible gift,\n\n2:06:13.420 --> 2:06:15.420\n almost no matter what.\n\n2:06:15.420 --> 2:06:20.420\n And I'm not, it's easy to look at suffering\n\n2:06:20.660 --> 2:06:22.780\n and think if we just escape the suffering,\n\n2:06:22.780 --> 2:06:27.400\n it will all be better, but we all die.\n\n2:06:28.620 --> 2:06:30.380\n There's beauty in the whole thing.\n\n2:06:30.380 --> 2:06:34.020\n And it is true that it's just,\n\n2:06:34.020 --> 2:06:35.340\n from all the stories I've read,\n\n2:06:35.340 --> 2:06:39.360\n especially in famine and starvation, it's just horrible.\n\n2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:41.280\n It is horrible suffering.\n\n2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:45.940\n But I also just want to say that there's love amidst it,\n\n2:06:45.940 --> 2:06:47.300\n and we can't forget that.\n\n2:06:47.300 --> 2:06:50.300\n No, no, I don't forget it, I don't forget it.\n\n2:06:50.300 --> 2:06:52.860\n And I think it's from the stories.\n\n2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:56.760\n Now, I don't want to make that compromise or that trade,\n\n2:06:56.760 --> 2:06:59.580\n but the intensity of friendship in war,\n\n2:06:59.580 --> 2:07:04.520\n the intensity of love in war is very high.\n\n2:07:04.520 --> 2:07:07.220\n So I'm not sure what to make of these calculations,\n\n2:07:07.220 --> 2:07:08.820\n but if you look at the stories,\n\n2:07:08.820 --> 2:07:10.580\n some of the people I'm closest with,\n\n2:07:10.580 --> 2:07:12.300\n and I've never experienced anything\n\n2:07:12.300 --> 2:07:14.260\n even close to any of this,\n\n2:07:14.260 --> 2:07:15.740\n but some of the people I'm closest with\n\n2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:18.280\n is people I've gone through difficult times with.\n\n2:07:18.280 --> 2:07:20.020\n There's something about that.\n\n2:07:20.020 --> 2:07:24.860\n They're a society or a group where things are easy.\n\n2:07:24.860 --> 2:07:27.580\n The intensity of the connection between human beings\n\n2:07:27.580 --> 2:07:29.020\n is not as strong.\n\n2:07:29.020 --> 2:07:31.420\n I don't know what to do with that calculus\n\n2:07:31.420 --> 2:07:32.740\n because I too agree with you.\n\n2:07:32.740 --> 2:07:37.540\n I want to have as little suffering in the world as possible,\n\n2:07:37.540 --> 2:07:39.360\n but we have to remember about the love\n\n2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:40.980\n and the depth of human connection\n\n2:07:40.980 --> 2:07:42.900\n and find the right balance there.\n\n2:07:44.800 --> 2:07:46.800\n No, there's something to what you're saying.\n\n2:07:46.800 --> 2:07:48.460\n There's clearly something to what you're saying.\n\n2:07:48.460 --> 2:07:50.700\n I was just thinking about the Soviet Union\n\n2:07:50.700 --> 2:07:53.440\n when I lived there and people on the streets\n\n2:07:53.440 --> 2:07:56.740\n were so mean to one another and they never smiled.\n\n2:07:56.740 --> 2:07:57.580\n You grew up there?\n\n2:07:57.580 --> 2:07:58.900\n No, but you were, you're too young to.\n\n2:07:58.900 --> 2:08:00.500\n No, no, I remember well.\n\n2:08:00.500 --> 2:08:01.820\n I came here when I was 13, yeah.\n\n2:08:01.820 --> 2:08:04.660\n Okay, so anyway, I remember living there\n\n2:08:04.660 --> 2:08:07.100\n and just how hard people were on each other on the streets.\n\n2:08:07.100 --> 2:08:09.020\n And when you got inside people's apartments,\n\n2:08:09.020 --> 2:08:11.260\n when they started to trust you,\n\n2:08:11.260 --> 2:08:14.120\n the friendships were so intense and so wonderful.\n\n2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:19.700\n So in that sense, I mean, they did live a hard life,\n\n2:08:19.700 --> 2:08:21.460\n but there wasn't a food on the table\n\n2:08:21.460 --> 2:08:23.060\n and there was a roof over their heads.\n\n2:08:23.060 --> 2:08:24.040\n There's a certain line.\n\n2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:25.980\n There's a certain, there are lines.\n\n2:08:25.980 --> 2:08:27.200\n I don't think there's one line,\n\n2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:29.940\n but it's kind of a shading.\n\n2:08:29.940 --> 2:08:32.100\n And the other story I was thinking of as you were talking\n\n2:08:32.100 --> 2:08:36.460\n was not a story, it's a history,\n\n2:08:36.460 --> 2:08:38.460\n a book by a friend of mine\n\n2:08:38.460 --> 2:08:43.460\n who wrote about love in the camps,\n\n2:08:43.940 --> 2:08:48.260\n in the refugee camps for Jews in Germany after the war.\n\n2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:51.300\n So these were Jews who had come mostly from Poland\n\n2:08:51.300 --> 2:08:54.100\n and some survived the camps,\n\n2:08:54.100 --> 2:08:56.180\n came from awful circumstances.\n\n2:08:56.180 --> 2:08:58.820\n And then they were put in these camps,\n\n2:08:58.820 --> 2:09:00.840\n which were not joyful places.\n\n2:09:00.840 --> 2:09:03.100\n I mean, they were guarded sometimes by Germans even,\n\n2:09:03.100 --> 2:09:06.260\n but they're basically under the British control\n\n2:09:06.260 --> 2:09:08.100\n and they were trying to get to Israel,\n\n2:09:08.100 --> 2:09:11.940\n trying to get to Palestine right after the war.\n\n2:09:11.940 --> 2:09:16.060\n And how many pairs there were, how many people coupled up.\n\n2:09:16.060 --> 2:09:18.660\n But remember, this is after being in the concentration camp.\n\n2:09:18.660 --> 2:09:20.580\n It's not being in the concentration camp.\n\n2:09:20.580 --> 2:09:25.580\n And it's also being free to, more or less free,\n\n2:09:26.780 --> 2:09:30.860\n to express their emotions and to be human beings\n\n2:09:30.860 --> 2:09:34.360\n after this horrible thing which they suffered.\n\n2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.880\n So I wonder whether there's, as you say,\n\n2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:41.560\n some kind of calculus there where the level of suffering\n\n2:09:41.560 --> 2:09:46.560\n is such that it's just too much for humans to bear.\n\n2:09:47.180 --> 2:09:51.100\n And which I would suggest,\n\n2:09:51.100 --> 2:09:52.620\n I mean, I haven't studied this myself.\n\n2:09:52.620 --> 2:09:54.700\n I'm just giving you my point of view,\n\n2:09:54.700 --> 2:09:57.480\n my off the cuff remarks here.\n\n2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:00.020\n But it was very inspiring to read about these couples\n\n2:10:00.020 --> 2:10:01.840\n who had met right in these camps\n\n2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:06.020\n and started to couple up and get married.\n\n2:10:06.020 --> 2:10:09.420\n And tried to find their way to Palestine,\n\n2:10:09.420 --> 2:10:11.540\n which was a difficult thing to do then.\n\n2:10:11.540 --> 2:10:14.460\n When did you live in Russia and the Soviet Union?\n\n2:10:14.460 --> 2:10:16.100\n What's your memory of the time?\n\n2:10:16.100 --> 2:10:18.460\n Well, so a number of different times.\n\n2:10:18.460 --> 2:10:22.220\n So I went there, I first went there in 69, 70.\n\n2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:23.740\n Wow. A long time ago.\n\n2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:28.740\n And then I lived in Leningrad mostly,\n\n2:10:28.740 --> 2:10:31.620\n but also in Moscow in 1975.\n\n2:10:31.620 --> 2:10:33.700\n So it was detente time.\n\n2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:38.700\n But it was also a time of political uncertainty\n\n2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:44.500\n and also hardship for Russians themselves,\n\n2:10:44.780 --> 2:10:46.060\n standing in long lines.\n\n2:10:46.060 --> 2:10:47.980\n I mean, you must remember this for food\n\n2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:51.780\n and for getting anything was almost impossible.\n\n2:10:51.780 --> 2:10:55.420\n It was a time when Jews were trying to get out.\n\n2:10:56.820 --> 2:10:59.880\n In fact, I just talked to a friend of mine from those days\n\n2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:01.740\n who I helped get out and get to Boston\n\n2:11:01.740 --> 2:11:05.380\n and the lovely people who had managed to have a good life\n\n2:11:06.260 --> 2:11:08.780\n in the United States after they left.\n\n2:11:08.780 --> 2:11:10.020\n But it wasn't an easy time.\n\n2:11:10.020 --> 2:11:11.740\n It wasn't an easy time at all.\n\n2:11:11.740 --> 2:11:13.940\n I remember people set fire to their doors\n\n2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:18.340\n and their daughter was persecuted in school\n\n2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:21.460\n once they declared that they wanted to immigrate\n\n2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:22.380\n and that sort of thing.\n\n2:11:22.380 --> 2:11:25.280\n So it was a very, it was a lot of antisemitism.\n\n2:11:27.420 --> 2:11:28.580\n So it was a tough time.\n\n2:11:28.580 --> 2:11:32.340\n Dissidents hung out with some dissidents\n\n2:11:32.340 --> 2:11:34.220\n and one guy was actually killed.\n\n2:11:35.620 --> 2:11:38.560\n We think by the, nobody knows exactly by the KGB,\n\n2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:40.900\n but his art studio was,\n\n2:11:40.900 --> 2:11:43.500\n he had a separate studio in Leningrad,\n\n2:11:43.500 --> 2:11:48.500\n St. Petersburg today, just a small studio\n\n2:11:48.620 --> 2:11:51.380\n where he did his art and somebody set it on fire.\n\n2:11:51.380 --> 2:11:54.380\n And we think it was KGB, but you never really know.\n\n2:11:56.380 --> 2:11:57.900\n And he died in that fire.\n\n2:11:57.900 --> 2:12:01.460\n So it was not, it was a tough time.\n\n2:12:01.460 --> 2:12:04.660\n And you knew you were followed,\n\n2:12:04.660 --> 2:12:06.540\n you knew you were being reported on\n\n2:12:06.540 --> 2:12:08.860\n as a foreign scholar as I was.\n\n2:12:08.860 --> 2:12:12.360\n There was a formal exchange between the United States\n\n2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:16.620\n and the Soviet Union and they let me work in the archives,\n\n2:12:16.620 --> 2:12:21.620\n but then Ivanov got to work in the physics lab\n\n2:12:22.300 --> 2:12:24.460\n at Rochester or something like that.\n\n2:12:24.460 --> 2:12:29.220\n So it was an exchange which sent historians\n\n2:12:29.220 --> 2:12:33.620\n and literary people and some social scientists to Russia\n\n2:12:33.620 --> 2:12:36.660\n and they sent all scientists here to grab what they could\n\n2:12:36.660 --> 2:12:38.420\n from MIT and those places.\n\n2:12:39.380 --> 2:12:40.620\n How's your Russian?\n\n2:12:41.860 --> 2:12:44.560\n Do you have any knowledge of Russian language\n\n2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:46.300\n that has helped you to understand?\n\n2:12:46.300 --> 2:12:47.500\n Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:50.180\n I mean, I can read it fine.\n\n2:12:50.180 --> 2:12:52.940\n And the speaking comes and goes,\n\n2:12:52.940 --> 2:12:55.900\n depending on whether I'm there or I've been there recently\n\n2:12:55.900 --> 2:12:57.500\n or if I spend some time there,\n\n2:12:57.500 --> 2:12:58.660\n because I really need, you know,\n\n2:12:58.660 --> 2:13:00.460\n I have Russian friends who speak just Russian.\n\n2:13:00.460 --> 2:13:04.340\n So, you know, when I'm there, I then, you know,\n\n2:13:04.340 --> 2:13:05.780\n I can communicate pretty well.\n\n2:13:05.780 --> 2:13:08.120\n Well, I can't really write it unfortunately.\n\n2:13:08.120 --> 2:13:11.900\n I mean, I can, but it's not very good,\n\n2:13:11.900 --> 2:13:13.980\n but I get along fine in Russia.\n\n2:13:13.980 --> 2:13:17.980\n What's your fondest memory of the Soviet Union, of Russia?\n\n2:13:17.980 --> 2:13:18.820\n It's friends.\n\n2:13:18.820 --> 2:13:19.660\n Friends?\n\n2:13:19.660 --> 2:13:20.940\n It's friends, it's friends.\n\n2:13:20.940 --> 2:13:25.180\n Was it vodka involved or is it just vodka involved?\n\n2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:27.420\n Little bit, you know, I'm not much of a drinker.\n\n2:13:27.420 --> 2:13:29.580\n So I would, you know, they'd just make fun of me\n\n2:13:29.580 --> 2:13:32.980\n and I'd make fun of myself and that was easy enough.\n\n2:13:32.980 --> 2:13:35.720\n I don't really like, you know, a heavy drink.\n\n2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:37.860\n I've done a lot of that, not a lot.\n\n2:13:37.860 --> 2:13:40.180\n I'd done some of that, but I never really enjoyed it\n\n2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:42.580\n and would get sick and stuff.\n\n2:13:42.580 --> 2:13:45.340\n But no, it's friends.\n\n2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:49.540\n You know, one friend I made in the dormitory, you know,\n\n2:13:49.540 --> 2:13:51.460\n it was a dormitory for foreigners,\n\n2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:56.220\n but also Siberians who had come, you know,\n\n2:13:56.220 --> 2:13:58.740\n to Leningrad to study.\n\n2:13:58.740 --> 2:14:00.380\n And so I met a couple of guys\n\n2:14:00.380 --> 2:14:04.580\n and one in particular from Omsk became a wonderful friend.\n\n2:14:04.580 --> 2:14:06.940\n And we talked and talked and talked outside.\n\n2:14:06.940 --> 2:14:08.300\n You know, we would go walk outside\n\n2:14:08.300 --> 2:14:10.500\n because we both knew they were, you know,\n\n2:14:10.500 --> 2:14:12.060\n people were listening and stuff.\n\n2:14:12.060 --> 2:14:15.020\n And he would say, well, this is, he was an historian,\n\n2:14:15.020 --> 2:14:16.700\n you know, and so we would talk history.\n\n2:14:16.700 --> 2:14:18.580\n And he'd say, well, this was the case, wasn't it?\n\n2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:21.100\n I said, no, I'm sorry, Sasha, it wasn't the case.\n\n2:14:21.100 --> 2:14:23.180\n It was, you know,\n\n2:14:23.180 --> 2:14:26.460\n we think Stalin actually had a role in killing Kirov.\n\n2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:28.980\n I mean, we're not sure, but he said, no.\n\n2:14:28.980 --> 2:14:29.900\n I said, yeah.\n\n2:14:29.900 --> 2:14:32.100\n You know, so, you know, we had these conversations\n\n2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:36.580\n and he was, what I would,\n\n2:14:36.580 --> 2:14:38.260\n I don't know if he would agree with me or not.\n\n2:14:38.260 --> 2:14:39.220\n I mean, we're still friends.\n\n2:14:39.220 --> 2:14:43.980\n So he was a naive, maybe he'll listen to the blog\n\n2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:45.260\n or I'll send it to him or something.\n\n2:14:45.260 --> 2:14:48.180\n He was a kind of naive Marxist, Leninist.\n\n2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:51.260\n And he thought I was, you know, I was, you know,\n\n2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:52.780\n I had this capitalist ideology.\n\n2:14:52.780 --> 2:14:54.260\n He'd say, what ideology you have?\n\n2:14:54.260 --> 2:14:56.380\n And I said, I don't have an ideology.\n\n2:14:56.380 --> 2:14:59.980\n You know, I try to just put together kind of reason\n\n2:14:59.980 --> 2:15:02.620\n and facts and accurate stories\n\n2:15:02.620 --> 2:15:03.860\n and try to tell them in that way.\n\n2:15:03.860 --> 2:15:06.700\n No, no, no, no, you must, you know, you're a bourgeois,\n\n2:15:06.700 --> 2:15:07.540\n you know, this or that.\n\n2:15:07.540 --> 2:15:09.140\n I said, no, I'm really not.\n\n2:15:09.140 --> 2:15:11.940\n And so we would have these talks\n\n2:15:11.940 --> 2:15:13.140\n and these kinds of arguments.\n\n2:15:13.140 --> 2:15:16.740\n And then, I mean, sure enough, you know,\n\n2:15:16.740 --> 2:15:19.220\n we corresponded for a while\n\n2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:20.940\n and then he had to stop corresponding\n\n2:15:20.940 --> 2:15:25.620\n because he became a kind of local official in Omsk.\n\n2:15:25.620 --> 2:15:29.540\n And he sort of migrated more and more to being a Democrat.\n\n2:15:29.540 --> 2:15:31.620\n And he was then in the, you know,\n\n2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:34.900\n democratic movement under Gorbachev\n\n2:15:34.900 --> 2:15:38.500\n and, you know, in the council of people's deputies,\n\n2:15:38.500 --> 2:15:40.580\n which they set up, which was, you know,\n\n2:15:41.660 --> 2:15:45.180\n elected as a Democrat from Omsk\n\n2:15:45.180 --> 2:15:49.460\n and had a political career through the Yeltsin period.\n\n2:15:49.460 --> 2:15:52.780\n And once Putin came along, you know, it was over.\n\n2:15:53.980 --> 2:15:56.180\n He didn't like Putin and, you know,\n\n2:15:56.180 --> 2:15:59.140\n and Putin didn't like the Yeltsin people, right?\n\n2:15:59.140 --> 2:16:02.620\n Who were, tried to be, some of them tried to be Democrats.\n\n2:16:02.620 --> 2:16:04.180\n And Sasha was one who really did.\n\n2:16:04.180 --> 2:16:06.580\n He just published his memoirs in Russian, by the way,\n\n2:16:06.580 --> 2:16:08.020\n which are very good, I think.\n\n2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:11.220\n I think I've been hearing it.\n\n2:16:11.220 --> 2:16:15.660\n Komanderovkifovlast, that's what it's called.\n\n2:16:15.660 --> 2:16:19.460\n It's hard to translate in English, Komanderovkifovlast.\n\n2:16:19.460 --> 2:16:22.020\n But I mean, I translated it full points once for him.\n\n2:16:22.020 --> 2:16:23.060\n This is so beautiful.\n\n2:16:23.060 --> 2:16:26.540\n Like the, do you find that the translation is a problem\n\n2:16:26.540 --> 2:16:27.380\n or no?\n\n2:16:27.380 --> 2:16:28.380\n It's such a different language.\n\n2:16:28.380 --> 2:16:30.140\n Yes, translation is very difficult.\n\n2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:31.300\n With the Russian language, I mean,\n\n2:16:31.300 --> 2:16:35.660\n it's the only language I know deeply except English.\n\n2:16:35.660 --> 2:16:38.780\n And it seems like so much is lost of the pain,\n\n2:16:38.780 --> 2:16:40.700\n the poetry, the beauty of the people.\n\n2:16:40.700 --> 2:16:44.380\n And translators are to be treasured and good ones,\n\n2:16:44.380 --> 2:16:47.780\n to be, I mean, those who do the translations,\n\n2:16:47.780 --> 2:16:50.620\n when you read things in translation,\n\n2:16:50.620 --> 2:16:52.100\n sometimes they're quite beautiful,\n\n2:16:52.100 --> 2:16:55.380\n whether it's Russian or Polish or German or anything French.\n\n2:16:55.380 --> 2:16:57.500\n Yeah, I'm actually traveling to Paris\n\n2:16:57.500 --> 2:17:01.260\n to talk to the famous translators that Dostoevsky told story.\n\n2:17:02.620 --> 2:17:04.580\n And I'm just gonna do a several conversations with them\n\n2:17:04.580 --> 2:17:06.860\n about like, you could just sometimes just grab\n\n2:17:06.860 --> 2:17:09.380\n a single sentence and just talk about the translation\n\n2:17:09.380 --> 2:17:14.380\n in that sense, that's, and also, as you said,\n\n2:17:14.820 --> 2:17:16.180\n I would love to be a fly on the wall\n\n2:17:16.180 --> 2:17:17.580\n with some of those friends that you had\n\n2:17:17.580 --> 2:17:21.700\n because the perspective on history, nonacademic,\n\n2:17:21.700 --> 2:17:26.060\n sort of without just as human beings is so different\n\n2:17:26.060 --> 2:17:28.380\n from the United States versus Russia.\n\n2:17:28.380 --> 2:17:30.660\n When you talk about the way the World War II is perceived\n\n2:17:30.660 --> 2:17:35.260\n and all those kinds of things, it's fascinating.\n\n2:17:35.260 --> 2:17:39.500\n History also has, in it, opinion and perspective.\n\n2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:41.820\n And so sometimes stripping that away is really difficult.\n\n2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:44.980\n And then I guess that is your job and at its highest form,\n\n2:17:44.980 --> 2:17:47.500\n that is what you do as a historian.\n\n2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:48.860\n Well, Norman,\n\n2:17:48.860 --> 2:17:52.700\n Spasibo bashoi shto sivonya samaya katorini.\n\n2:17:52.700 --> 2:17:54.500\n I really appreciate your valuable time.\n\n2:17:54.500 --> 2:17:55.980\n It's truly an honor to talk to you\n\n2:17:55.980 --> 2:18:00.260\n and thank you for taking us through a trip,\n\n2:18:00.260 --> 2:18:02.740\n through some of the worst parts of human history\n\n2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:06.340\n and talking about hope and love at the end.\n\n2:18:06.340 --> 2:18:08.020\n So I really appreciate your time today.\n\n2:18:08.020 --> 2:18:08.860\n Okay, thank you.\n\n2:18:08.860 --> 2:18:09.700\n Thank you.\n\n2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:11.300\n Thank you for having me.\n\n2:18:11.300 --> 2:18:12.820\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:18:12.820 --> 2:18:14.220\n with Norman Namark.\n\n2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:15.460\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:18:15.460 --> 2:18:17.900\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:21.180\n And now let me leave you with some words from Stalin.\n\n2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:23.700\n A single death is a tragedy.\n\n2:18:23.700 --> 2:18:26.220\n A million deaths is a statistic.\n\n2:18:26.220 --> 2:18:32.220\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
