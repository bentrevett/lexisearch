  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.320 --> 00:03.240\n The following is a conversation with Josh Barnett,\n\n00:03.240 --> 00:04.760\n one of the greatest fighters\n\n00:04.760 --> 00:06.860\n and submission wrestlers in history,\n\n00:06.860 --> 00:09.720\n with an epic 25 year career\n\n00:09.720 --> 00:12.240\n that includes being the UFC heavyweight champion\n\n00:12.240 --> 00:14.440\n and countless other accolades.\n\n00:14.440 --> 00:17.440\n He also happens to be one of the most intelligent\n\n00:17.440 --> 00:20.960\n and brutally honest human beings in all of martial arts,\n\n00:20.960 --> 00:24.080\n and especially so about his appreciation of\n\n00:24.080 --> 00:27.120\n and fascination with violence.\n\n00:27.120 --> 00:29.120\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:29.120 --> 00:32.120\n which feels ridiculous to say after that introduction.\n\n00:32.120 --> 00:34.280\n Mung Pak low carb snacks,\n\n00:34.280 --> 00:36.300\n Element electrolyte drinks,\n\n00:36.300 --> 00:38.360\n Eight Sleep self cooling mattress,\n\n00:38.360 --> 00:40.980\n and Rev transcription and captioning service.\n\n00:40.980 --> 00:42.920\n Click the sponsor links to get a discount\n\n00:42.920 --> 00:44.840\n to support this podcast.\n\n00:44.840 --> 00:47.000\n As a side note, let me say that I've been a fan\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:49.140\n of Josh Barnett for a long time.\n\n00:49.140 --> 00:52.040\n This conversation was indeed a long time coming,\n\n00:52.040 --> 00:54.440\n and I'm sure we'll talk many times again.\n\n00:54.440 --> 00:57.240\n For what it's worth, I'm a student of combat sports\n\n00:57.240 --> 01:00.040\n and admire when they're done at the highest level,\n\n01:00.040 --> 01:02.800\n either through masterful execution of skill\n\n01:02.800 --> 01:05.800\n or relentless dominance of pure guts.\n\n01:05.800 --> 01:08.400\n For context, I'm a black belt in Jiu Jitsu\n\n01:08.400 --> 01:10.960\n and have competed in wrestling, submission grappling,\n\n01:10.960 --> 01:13.780\n Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and even catch wrestling,\n\n01:13.780 --> 01:15.640\n which is a variant of submission grappling\n\n01:15.640 --> 01:18.520\n that Josh is one of the great practitioners,\n\n01:18.520 --> 01:20.540\n scholars and teachers of.\n\n01:20.540 --> 01:21.840\n I could probably talk for hours\n\n01:21.840 --> 01:24.240\n about what I've learned from my time on the mat,\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:26.000\n but if I were to say one thing,\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.600\n it is that the mat is honest.\n\n01:28.600 --> 01:31.400\n You can't run away from yourself when you step on the mat.\n\n01:31.400 --> 01:34.760\n It reveals your fears, the lies you might tell yourself,\n\n01:34.760 --> 01:38.160\n all the delusions you might have, or at least I had,\n\n01:38.160 --> 01:40.760\n that there's anything in this world that can be achieved\n\n01:40.760 --> 01:43.620\n except through blood, sweat, and tears.\n\n01:43.620 --> 01:46.280\n That honesty, taken to the highest levels,\n\n01:46.280 --> 01:47.880\n as is the case with Josh,\n\n01:47.880 --> 01:50.160\n creates the most special of human beings\n\n01:50.160 --> 01:53.260\n and definitely someone who is fascinating to talk to.\n\n01:53.260 --> 01:56.260\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:56.260 --> 01:59.300\n review it on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify,\n\n01:59.300 --> 02:00.580\n support it on Patreon,\n\n02:00.580 --> 02:03.340\n or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n02:03.340 --> 02:06.540\n And now, here's my conversation with Josh Barnett.\n\n02:07.460 --> 02:10.420\n Who were the philosophers and philosophical ideas\n\n02:10.420 --> 02:11.620\n that influenced you the most?\n\n02:11.620 --> 02:12.940\n Are we just jumping right in?\n\n02:12.940 --> 02:14.140\n That's it. We're right in.\n\n02:14.140 --> 02:17.180\n We're not, no foreplay on camera, all right.\n\n02:17.180 --> 02:19.860\n I had an interesting philosophical journey,\n\n02:19.860 --> 02:21.180\n at least I think it's interesting,\n\n02:21.180 --> 02:26.180\n and that was, I think, as far as organized philosophy\n\n02:27.500 --> 02:31.780\n or maybe, authentic's not the right word,\n\n02:31.780 --> 02:33.900\n but like, yeah, we'll say organized.\n\n02:35.880 --> 02:40.500\n I would say that Nietzsche is probably one of the people\n\n02:40.500 --> 02:43.360\n with the most influence on me,\n\n02:43.360 --> 02:46.360\n but I also feel like, to a degree,\n\n02:46.360 --> 02:50.540\n your personality will oftentimes dictate\n\n02:50.540 --> 02:53.500\n what philosophers that you can vibe with, yeah.\n\n02:53.500 --> 02:56.660\n So what ideas from Nietzsche, was it the Ubermensch?\n\n02:56.660 --> 02:58.740\n Definitely the Ubermensch is huge to me\n\n02:58.740 --> 03:00.900\n because I see it as an extension\n\n03:00.900 --> 03:04.580\n of basically the religious concepts of God\n\n03:04.580 --> 03:06.740\n and higher ideals,\n\n03:06.740 --> 03:09.700\n but just put into a different, a secular context.\n\n03:09.700 --> 03:14.660\n And the idea also that the Ubermensch is striving\n\n03:14.660 --> 03:17.500\n and overcoming something that you're always working towards\n\n03:17.500 --> 03:20.180\n that very few will ever,\n\n03:20.180 --> 03:25.180\n it's not like the concept that you can just make them.\n\n03:25.460 --> 03:26.820\n It doesn't happen that way.\n\n03:26.820 --> 03:30.860\n And it's not based simply upon if you were, say,\n\n03:30.860 --> 03:32.220\n put through a genetic program\n\n03:32.220 --> 03:34.660\n and turned into a super soldier,\n\n03:34.660 --> 03:36.460\n like that wouldn't make it.\n\n03:36.460 --> 03:40.060\n That's like the very surface level\n\n03:40.060 --> 03:42.380\n and incorrect understanding of what the Ubermensch is.\n\n03:42.380 --> 03:46.620\n The Ubermensch is the idea of this kind of human\n\n03:46.620 --> 03:51.620\n that transcends all the weaker, lower aspects of humans,\n\n03:52.100 --> 03:53.260\n which we're full of.\n\n03:53.260 --> 03:55.860\n But I also think that there's an element in Nietzsche's\n\n03:55.860 --> 03:58.340\n writing that suggests that it's not something\n\n03:58.340 --> 04:01.220\n you can even be in all the time.\n\n04:01.220 --> 04:03.380\n Like it's even a temporary state\n\n04:03.380 --> 04:04.420\n because it's not something\n\n04:04.420 --> 04:05.980\n that we're capable of maintaining.\n\n04:05.980 --> 04:07.420\n It's something to strive for.\n\n04:07.420 --> 04:12.420\n Like a morality, an image, an ideal, a set of principles\n\n04:12.420 --> 04:16.060\n that we can connect to that doesn't rely on\n\n04:16.060 --> 04:19.300\n otherworldly kind of out there things.\n\n04:19.300 --> 04:20.580\n It's deeply human.\n\n04:20.580 --> 04:23.580\n With Nietzsche, I feel like the concept of the Ubermensch\n\n04:25.420 --> 04:28.860\n is something built on authenticity as well.\n\n04:28.860 --> 04:30.260\n Heidegger was like Dasein, right?\n\n04:30.260 --> 04:32.460\n So when you are authentic\n\n04:32.460 --> 04:35.660\n and Heidegger being a follower of Nietzsche's\n\n04:35.660 --> 04:37.460\n and highly influenced by him,\n\n04:38.460 --> 04:41.420\n I think that the Ubermensch is an example of authenticity\n\n04:41.420 --> 04:45.220\n in that it isn't about trying to be anything\n\n04:45.220 --> 04:50.100\n that you cannot be or to go against who you are,\n\n04:50.100 --> 04:52.860\n but to actually understand that, accept that,\n\n04:52.860 --> 04:54.820\n and then work with what you can work with\n\n04:54.820 --> 04:59.820\n and create from your lump of clay that is you.\n\n05:00.140 --> 05:02.660\n Because I can't become...\n\n05:04.380 --> 05:05.940\n There's certain things that are just not gonna happen\n\n05:05.940 --> 05:07.460\n for me because it's not in my proclivity.\n\n05:07.460 --> 05:09.500\n I mean, I'm never gonna be five foot tall\n\n05:09.500 --> 05:14.420\n and 120 pounds, I mean, that again, I guess.\n\n05:14.420 --> 05:19.420\n But I know, as you get more in tune with who you are,\n\n05:20.940 --> 05:24.180\n as you start learning more about what unique things\n\n05:24.180 --> 05:27.900\n or at least what that combination that makes you,\n\n05:27.900 --> 05:29.940\n that gestalt part of yourself,\n\n05:29.940 --> 05:32.220\n what those things are and how you can use them,\n\n05:32.220 --> 05:35.500\n then you can work towards being that,\n\n05:35.500 --> 05:38.220\n taking what that is and seeing if you can\n\n05:38.220 --> 05:39.580\n get to that point.\n\n05:39.580 --> 05:42.020\n Now, the likelihood is, no, maybe, probably never.\n\n05:42.020 --> 05:44.140\n I mean, but we can never achieve Godhood yet.\n\n05:44.140 --> 05:47.140\n Religion is a constant striving\n\n05:47.140 --> 05:50.420\n and a look at a higher ideal concept.\n\n05:50.420 --> 05:52.580\n Even if it's multiple gods or one God,\n\n05:52.580 --> 05:56.180\n it's still essentially all built around this concept.\n\n05:56.180 --> 05:59.980\n I like the idea of Catholics original sin.\n\n05:59.980 --> 06:01.460\n If you think of sin, not as evil,\n\n06:01.460 --> 06:04.940\n but as missing the mark, the archer's term where it derives,\n\n06:04.940 --> 06:07.220\n or even like in Spanish,\n\n06:07.220 --> 06:09.340\n you know, without.\n\n06:09.340 --> 06:13.020\n So as being, if you accept that you are imperfect,\n\n06:13.020 --> 06:15.380\n if you accept that you need to constantly strive\n\n06:15.380 --> 06:16.700\n even against yourself,\n\n06:16.700 --> 06:19.540\n because you will figure out the best ways\n\n06:19.540 --> 06:22.340\n at which to submarine your own capabilities,\n\n06:22.340 --> 06:25.380\n submarine your own dreams and wishes and whatever,\n\n06:25.380 --> 06:27.220\n you will ruin them more than anything else.\n\n06:27.220 --> 06:30.140\n And you will tell yourself that you ruined them on purpose\n\n06:30.140 --> 06:32.500\n for a good reason, or you'll say that you'll figure out\n\n06:32.500 --> 06:35.540\n a way to put it on everything else but yourself.\n\n06:35.540 --> 06:38.620\n And so the idea of thinking of,\n\n06:38.620 --> 06:41.380\n well, as I'm starting off on this whole thing,\n\n06:41.380 --> 06:43.540\n I got a lot of work to do, and that's just the way it is.\n\n06:43.540 --> 06:45.900\n And I gotta figure out what areas those are gonna be.\n\n06:45.900 --> 06:47.980\n And so, you know, I thought, oh yeah,\n\n06:47.980 --> 06:50.620\n if I think of original sin actually can be,\n\n06:50.620 --> 06:52.340\n that can be kind of a clever idea,\n\n06:52.340 --> 06:55.020\n but it's also just accepting that\n\n06:56.020 --> 07:01.020\n we're all uniquely strange and unequal in our own ways,\n\n07:01.060 --> 07:02.940\n but we have to figure out how that fits in.\n\n07:02.940 --> 07:05.820\n The word authenticity kind of connects to all of that.\n\n07:05.820 --> 07:08.780\n So striving to be your authentic self means\n\n07:08.780 --> 07:11.540\n figuring out exactly the shape of the flaws,\n\n07:11.540 --> 07:15.820\n the character of your little demons that you get to play with\n\n07:15.820 --> 07:18.700\n and around them finding a path to whatever the hell\n\n07:20.220 --> 07:22.460\n ideal versions of yourself you can carve\n\n07:22.460 --> 07:25.420\n and pretending like that's such a thing as even possible.\n\n07:25.420 --> 07:29.620\n The other idea about Nietzsche is on his idea of morality.\n\n07:29.620 --> 07:33.860\n He presents the argument that morality is a human illusion\n\n07:33.860 --> 07:37.420\n and that there's not such a thing as good and evil,\n\n07:37.420 --> 07:39.420\n and these are all kind of constructs.\n\n07:39.420 --> 07:42.540\n Do you think there's such a thing as good and evil\n\n07:42.540 --> 07:44.820\n that's connected to some objective reality?\n\n07:44.820 --> 07:47.620\n I think that there are some,\n\n07:47.620 --> 07:49.900\n I actually do believe that there are some universals.\n\n07:49.900 --> 07:51.500\n I'm not Kantian in any way,\n\n07:51.500 --> 07:53.380\n but I do think that there are some universals.\n\n07:53.380 --> 07:54.700\n And the thing that actually brought me\n\n07:54.700 --> 07:57.020\n to even the concept of that was Jung.\n\n07:57.020 --> 08:02.020\n So Jung's concept of collective unconsciousness\n\n08:02.300 --> 08:04.900\n and then taking that thought\n\n08:04.900 --> 08:08.380\n and then applying it to looking through history\n\n08:08.380 --> 08:11.700\n and the most varied history you can find.\n\n08:11.700 --> 08:15.100\n So I would say probably religion is your earliest one\n\n08:15.100 --> 08:17.380\n that you can get for written history\n\n08:17.380 --> 08:22.380\n or written examples of human behavior and psychology\n\n08:22.380 --> 08:27.380\n at the furthest that we can look into it from man's hand\n\n08:29.380 --> 08:32.620\n to whatever the medium is, cuneiform or whatever.\n\n08:32.620 --> 08:34.620\n But as you do that, and then let's say going\n\n08:34.620 --> 08:39.620\n from Mesopotamia to India to Europe\n\n08:39.660 --> 08:41.740\n and just going from all these places,\n\n08:41.740 --> 08:43.500\n as disparate as they may seem,\n\n08:43.500 --> 08:45.780\n as many different cultures and ethnicities and religions\n\n08:45.780 --> 08:47.700\n and how the religions will vary quite a bit\n\n08:47.700 --> 08:52.700\n from monotheist to polytheist and so on and so forth.\n\n08:53.500 --> 08:55.780\n But then just seeing how there's all the through lines.\n\n08:55.780 --> 08:58.900\n And of course, Campbell, he did this\n\n08:58.900 --> 09:01.780\n much earlier than me thinking about it.\n\n09:01.780 --> 09:06.780\n But I think that by looking at things that way\n\n09:07.180 --> 09:08.660\n and starting to find the threads\n\n09:08.660 --> 09:10.500\n instead of always just looking at everything\n\n09:10.500 --> 09:12.940\n as being its own compartmentalized concept\n\n09:12.940 --> 09:16.060\n as if it only applies to this time, this people,\n\n09:16.060 --> 09:18.580\n like getting overly pomo about it\n\n09:18.580 --> 09:21.540\n is just a really idiotic postmodern.\n\n09:21.540 --> 09:24.500\n So you think that there is, just like with Joseph Campbell,\n\n09:24.500 --> 09:28.020\n there's a thread that connects all of these stories,\n\n09:28.020 --> 09:30.980\n narratives that we constructed for ourselves as we evolve.\n\n09:30.980 --> 09:35.260\n And that thread is grounded in some kind of absolute ideas\n\n09:35.260 --> 09:37.660\n of maybe on the morality side,\n\n09:37.660 --> 09:39.380\n which is the trickiest one of good and evil.\n\n09:39.380 --> 09:41.660\n Somewhat, yeah, I think that a lot of this stuff\n\n09:41.660 --> 09:44.300\n is just derived from a biological perspective.\n\n09:44.300 --> 09:47.380\n I feel like these things are innate within us.\n\n09:47.380 --> 09:50.740\n Do you think our innately humans are good?\n\n09:50.740 --> 09:52.820\n No, I don't.\n\n09:52.820 --> 09:56.420\n I feel like, I also feel like there's the issue of scale too.\n\n09:56.420 --> 10:01.300\n Like Nassim Taleb likes to talk about how he views his,\n\n10:01.300 --> 10:05.260\n the way he interacts with groups in terms of scale.\n\n10:05.260 --> 10:08.300\n What is this thing about like at the familial level,\n\n10:08.300 --> 10:12.060\n I'm a communist and then at the civic level,\n\n10:12.060 --> 10:14.700\n I'm a Republican or something.\n\n10:14.700 --> 10:16.020\n And at this other level,\n\n10:16.020 --> 10:17.540\n and then it goes on at the widest level,\n\n10:17.540 --> 10:20.100\n he's a libertarian or something of that nature.\n\n10:20.100 --> 10:22.580\n Like fundamentally human interaction changes.\n\n10:22.580 --> 10:23.740\n On scale. On scale.\n\n10:23.740 --> 10:28.540\n And scale and also from subjective\n\n10:28.540 --> 10:29.740\n to the environment around them.\n\n10:29.740 --> 10:31.460\n So, and I don't even mean environment\n\n10:31.460 --> 10:35.060\n just in the sake of physical environment, nature, right?\n\n10:35.060 --> 10:36.660\n Like nature is constantly trying to murder you.\n\n10:36.660 --> 10:37.780\n Well, it's not really trying.\n\n10:37.780 --> 10:39.740\n It's just nature's being nature.\n\n10:39.740 --> 10:41.140\n The universe is the universe.\n\n10:41.140 --> 10:43.740\n And at times it takes you out.\n\n10:43.740 --> 10:48.740\n It's just not with any particular compunction or prejudice.\n\n10:49.460 --> 10:52.780\n It's just, oops, you know, sorry, there's no more dodos.\n\n10:52.780 --> 10:53.820\n My bad.\n\n10:53.820 --> 10:55.540\n But don't you think the particular flavor\n\n10:55.540 --> 11:00.140\n of the complexity that is the human mind was created,\n\n11:00.140 --> 11:02.180\n like let me make an argument\n\n11:02.180 --> 11:04.860\n for that all people are fundamentally good.\n\n11:04.860 --> 11:05.780\n Okay.\n\n11:05.780 --> 11:08.900\n Is there's an evolutionary advantage\n\n11:08.900 --> 11:13.060\n to being, to striving to cooperate,\n\n11:13.060 --> 11:16.900\n to add more love to the world of like compassion, empathy,\n\n11:16.900 --> 11:18.100\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n11:18.100 --> 11:22.820\n And that the very thing that created the human mind\n\n11:22.820 --> 11:25.700\n was this evolutionary advantage,\n\n11:25.700 --> 11:28.180\n whatever the forces behind this evolutionary advantage.\n\n11:28.180 --> 11:29.660\n And scale, yes.\n\n11:29.660 --> 11:33.380\n So when we're dealing with a small tribe, sure.\n\n11:33.380 --> 11:36.500\n When you meet another tribe, maybe.\n\n11:36.500 --> 11:38.940\n There's other factors that are going into that.\n\n11:38.940 --> 11:41.300\n Let's say you scale up.\n\n11:41.300 --> 11:46.100\n And so your 150 has exceeded their 150.\n\n11:46.100 --> 11:48.500\n And like, you start to get to a certain point\n\n11:48.500 --> 11:53.500\n where you can't really be close enough\n\n11:54.220 --> 11:56.900\n to someone down the line of some of that next,\n\n11:56.900 --> 11:58.980\n like that 150 is 150, 150.\n\n11:58.980 --> 12:03.980\n And they just now all of a sudden become some guy, whatever.\n\n12:03.980 --> 12:08.060\n And when it comes to some guy, once it starts hitting scale,\n\n12:08.060 --> 12:10.660\n I don't know that it's capable.\n\n12:12.260 --> 12:17.260\n People can be as magnanimous to a stranger as to the known.\n\n12:19.620 --> 12:23.020\n If they orient themselves to be secure enough,\n\n12:23.020 --> 12:25.260\n because it does come to security, insecurity\n\n12:25.260 --> 12:28.260\n in one way or the other, either brought on by the unknown,\n\n12:28.260 --> 12:30.500\n brought on by an actual threat,\n\n12:30.500 --> 12:32.100\n brought on by even their own,\n\n12:32.100 --> 12:34.340\n as we would use the word insecurity in that\n\n12:34.340 --> 12:36.620\n their own insecurity within their own capabilities,\n\n12:36.620 --> 12:38.420\n their own belief in themselves,\n\n12:38.420 --> 12:41.540\n all these things can change things\n\n12:41.540 --> 12:44.820\n from being compassionate and what have you\n\n12:44.820 --> 12:47.780\n to at least at the very least, maybe not evil,\n\n12:47.780 --> 12:52.780\n but self interest driven to the point of a negative results\n\n12:53.140 --> 12:55.460\n for those that aren't, you know what I mean?\n\n12:55.460 --> 12:56.500\n Right.\n\n12:56.500 --> 13:00.820\n But another way to frame that is maybe it's less about scale\n\n13:00.820 --> 13:02.860\n and more about the amount of resources available.\n\n13:02.860 --> 13:06.220\n So if we're overflowing with resources\n\n13:06.220 --> 13:09.940\n in terms of security and safety,\n\n13:09.940 --> 13:12.380\n all the things you've mentioned,\n\n13:13.260 --> 13:15.060\n if we have more than enough resources,\n\n13:15.060 --> 13:16.740\n then the way we treat a stranger,\n\n13:16.740 --> 13:19.420\n the way we position ourselves towards that stranger\n\n13:19.420 --> 13:24.420\n might be in a way that allows us to be our real human selves\n\n13:25.700 --> 13:27.860\n as opposed to sort of our animal self.\n\n13:27.860 --> 13:29.780\n And therefore it's mostly about\n\n13:29.780 --> 13:32.540\n how clever can we descendants of Abe's be\n\n13:32.540 --> 13:35.620\n in coming up with all cool kinds of technologies\n\n13:35.620 --> 13:39.300\n and ways to efficiently use the resources we have\n\n13:39.300 --> 13:40.980\n such that we're not constrained.\n\n13:40.980 --> 13:45.980\n And my hope is that human innovation\n\n13:46.580 --> 13:49.580\n will outpace the growth of our,\n\n13:49.580 --> 13:52.980\n the number of people that are starving for resources.\n\n13:52.980 --> 13:56.900\n Yes, I think that there's a lot of rationality\n\n13:56.900 --> 13:59.100\n behind this argument.\n\n13:59.100 --> 14:04.100\n And in some ways I agree and in a lot of ways\n\n14:04.620 --> 14:09.620\n I see it as missing the point\n\n14:09.860 --> 14:13.300\n of how this experiment has been playing out across time.\n\n14:13.300 --> 14:18.300\n When you look at what, for one, it's like define resources.\n\n14:18.460 --> 14:23.460\n What is a resource of as humans would define it, right?\n\n14:25.540 --> 14:26.860\n Or wealth even.\n\n14:26.860 --> 14:31.220\n And so you can say, well, an iPhone's a resource,\n\n14:31.220 --> 14:34.940\n the internet's a resource, water obviously is a resource.\n\n14:34.940 --> 14:38.020\n But if we weigh them, what is more important\n\n14:38.020 --> 14:41.500\n to human beings, water, internet or iPhones?\n\n14:41.500 --> 14:42.620\n It's water, right?\n\n14:42.620 --> 14:46.220\n So if we look at resources, if we start with\n\n14:46.220 --> 14:48.700\n what do human beings need to live?\n\n14:48.700 --> 14:52.340\n I mean, actually live, not live here\n\n14:52.340 --> 14:56.260\n in this bullshit fantasy creation extension\n\n14:56.260 --> 14:59.860\n of our own ingenuity and a prison of our own creation\n\n14:59.860 --> 15:02.220\n and also a paradise of our own creation.\n\n15:02.220 --> 15:04.980\n But this is not how human beings normally live.\n\n15:04.980 --> 15:06.740\n This is all built upon stuff,\n\n15:06.740 --> 15:11.740\n it's built on concept, on idea and some of it's built\n\n15:12.740 --> 15:15.860\n on just, well, this is the paradigm so this is what you do.\n\n15:15.860 --> 15:19.740\n Human beings need food, they need water to survive,\n\n15:19.740 --> 15:22.580\n they need shelter from the elements\n\n15:22.580 --> 15:26.460\n and they need certain skills to perpetuate these things\n\n15:26.460 --> 15:28.660\n and be able to pass them down so that they can,\n\n15:28.660 --> 15:30.820\n so that these things don't become,\n\n15:32.180 --> 15:34.420\n you don't end up in this gap where you have\n\n15:34.420 --> 15:37.780\n to relearn things because if it's lost,\n\n15:37.780 --> 15:41.620\n then that time before you can get it back again\n\n15:41.620 --> 15:44.780\n is going to be dark ages of sorts\n\n15:44.780 --> 15:48.220\n or it's going to be highly detrimental to your group\n\n15:48.220 --> 15:51.500\n because not knowing how to fish, not knowing how to hunt,\n\n15:51.500 --> 15:55.140\n not knowing how to even clean and cook the game\n\n15:55.140 --> 15:58.380\n once you have it could be lethal.\n\n15:58.380 --> 16:00.700\n That's fascinating to think of that as a basic resource,\n\n16:00.700 --> 16:04.020\n the knowledge to attain the very low level things of water.\n\n16:04.020 --> 16:05.500\n Right, and we'll figure it out.\n\n16:05.500 --> 16:07.860\n We did it once before and we've done it over\n\n16:07.860 --> 16:09.540\n and over and over and over again.\n\n16:09.540 --> 16:11.020\n It's just costly.\n\n16:11.020 --> 16:13.220\n Yes, it has costs for sure.\n\n16:14.500 --> 16:19.500\n But when you think of how you look at the,\n\n16:19.500 --> 16:23.100\n well, we'll just deal with the first world of the West.\n\n16:23.100 --> 16:28.100\n You look at the pathway of Western civilization\n\n16:29.260 --> 16:32.380\n and its growth and then you look at how technology\n\n16:32.380 --> 16:34.500\n injected into it over time,\n\n16:34.500 --> 16:38.660\n how it magnifies things or pushes things\n\n16:38.660 --> 16:41.380\n at orders of magnitude faster\n\n16:41.380 --> 16:43.900\n and then the internet comes along and even faster.\n\n16:43.900 --> 16:46.580\n So you're watching industrial revolution to,\n\n16:46.580 --> 16:50.300\n what is it, the capacitor and then so on.\n\n16:50.300 --> 16:51.540\n It goes further and further.\n\n16:51.540 --> 16:54.340\n And as the internet and technology,\n\n16:54.340 --> 16:56.740\n especially on the electronic side of things,\n\n16:56.740 --> 16:59.140\n start increasing in capability,\n\n16:59.140 --> 17:04.140\n it massively outpaces even our necessity for it at times.\n\n17:04.860 --> 17:08.340\n It becomes, you know, plant obsolescence happens quicker\n\n17:08.340 --> 17:10.100\n and over and over and over again\n\n17:10.100 --> 17:13.060\n and wealth increases, increases, increases, increases\n\n17:13.060 --> 17:16.380\n in terms of the things that we're able to acquire, right?\n\n17:16.380 --> 17:19.340\n I mean, I've seen homeless people with smartphones,\n\n17:19.340 --> 17:23.660\n you know, so we're living in the most wealth laden,\n\n17:23.660 --> 17:28.620\n luxury laden age of all of humanity yet.\n\n17:29.780 --> 17:32.580\n What happens when we see calamity\n\n17:32.580 --> 17:33.980\n or people go on hard time?\n\n17:33.980 --> 17:36.420\n What are the things that they value?\n\n17:36.420 --> 17:38.740\n You know, what do people go to an argument\n\n17:38.740 --> 17:41.740\n about the cost of things that are luxury items generally\n\n17:41.740 --> 17:44.380\n and not necessity items?\n\n17:44.380 --> 17:49.380\n You know, we get into fights about things that are\n\n17:50.380 --> 17:53.140\n at the end of the day, not necessities to us.\n\n17:53.140 --> 17:55.900\n You know, people are so concerned about Netflix\n\n17:55.900 --> 17:58.060\n and the internet and personally,\n\n17:58.060 --> 17:59.700\n I'm very concerned about the internet\n\n17:59.700 --> 18:02.620\n because I look at it as my own little personal library\n\n18:02.620 --> 18:05.060\n of Alexandria in my pocket.\n\n18:05.060 --> 18:06.020\n That's what I love about it.\n\n18:06.020 --> 18:09.020\n And the ability to have a tool as effective as it is,\n\n18:09.020 --> 18:10.740\n even though I'm in a constant battle\n\n18:10.740 --> 18:13.860\n to not let that tool become a vice\n\n18:13.860 --> 18:17.100\n or to become something that actually\n\n18:17.100 --> 18:19.020\n brings me to a lower state.\n\n18:19.020 --> 18:21.900\n But are we willing, the question is over the,\n\n18:21.900 --> 18:24.780\n are we willing to murder each other over Netflix\n\n18:24.780 --> 18:27.180\n versus murder each other over water?\n\n18:27.180 --> 18:29.700\n We're willing to murder each other over water.\n\n18:29.700 --> 18:30.740\n That's a given.\n\n18:30.740 --> 18:33.060\n Right, but that's our animalistic selves.\n\n18:33.060 --> 18:35.740\n Well, it's also a necessity for, it's animalistic,\n\n18:35.740 --> 18:38.220\n but it's also either you do it or you don't, right?\n\n18:38.220 --> 18:40.380\n Like unless somebody's willing to share that water\n\n18:40.380 --> 18:44.300\n or if that water is of such a limited capability\n\n18:45.940 --> 18:47.500\n or such a limited amount,\n\n18:47.500 --> 18:50.980\n then you will have to murder to have that water.\n\n18:50.980 --> 18:53.180\n Netflix, the argument is the higher,\n\n18:53.180 --> 18:57.540\n we get up to this hierarchy of what we consider\n\n18:57.540 --> 19:00.300\n in Los Angeles resources,\n\n19:00.300 --> 19:02.940\n we're less willing to be, to commit violence.\n\n19:02.940 --> 19:05.060\n We're less willing to commit violence,\n\n19:05.060 --> 19:06.020\n I would say over Netflix,\n\n19:06.020 --> 19:07.860\n but we are willing to commit violence over Netflix,\n\n19:07.860 --> 19:09.420\n over everything associated with Netflix,\n\n19:09.420 --> 19:11.660\n over televisions, over sneakers,\n\n19:11.660 --> 19:16.660\n over, you know, I mean, when we look at a good,\n\n19:17.940 --> 19:20.060\n I mean, the majority of the stuff\n\n19:20.060 --> 19:21.420\n that came with the riots,\n\n19:21.420 --> 19:26.420\n I mean, it was used car dealerships, targets.\n\n19:26.740 --> 19:28.420\n I mean, and then you look and it's like, well, okay,\n\n19:28.420 --> 19:30.420\n well, what are people, what do they gotta,\n\n19:30.420 --> 19:34.780\n what are they so hell bent to get out of this whole thing?\n\n19:34.780 --> 19:36.660\n And I'm even talking about the ideological elements\n\n19:36.660 --> 19:37.500\n or anything like that.\n\n19:37.500 --> 19:38.860\n Just like, okay, something's going on,\n\n19:38.860 --> 19:41.220\n boom, looting, whatever, you know,\n\n19:41.220 --> 19:42.660\n what are you gonna loot?\n\n19:42.660 --> 19:46.220\n You know, you'll have AOC say, oh, people needing bread.\n\n19:46.220 --> 19:48.340\n I didn't see a single loaf of bread.\n\n19:48.340 --> 19:52.140\n You know, I saw televisions and shoes and you know,\n\n19:52.140 --> 19:54.660\n but to me, it is poetry in a sense,\n\n19:54.660 --> 19:57.860\n because you get to see who we,\n\n19:57.860 --> 20:00.020\n how we actually are operating, you know,\n\n20:00.020 --> 20:03.340\n what is becoming first principles to most people.\n\n20:03.340 --> 20:05.380\n But wait, wait, but you could also argue though,\n\n20:05.380 --> 20:07.620\n those riots were more like the madness of crowds,\n\n20:07.620 --> 20:10.020\n which is definitely a lot more than just that.\n\n20:10.020 --> 20:13.260\n I'm just saying that given a chance, it's like, okay, boom,\n\n20:13.260 --> 20:15.820\n the lights are off, the grid is down.\n\n20:15.820 --> 20:18.700\n We've hacked into the whole system,\n\n20:18.700 --> 20:19.860\n turned into an 80s movie.\n\n20:19.860 --> 20:24.820\n And you have the ability to go get ahold of whatever it is\n\n20:24.820 --> 20:26.500\n that you think is most important.\n\n20:26.500 --> 20:27.660\n And what do we do?\n\n20:27.660 --> 20:30.580\n And I say, we, as in, you know, including all of us,\n\n20:30.580 --> 20:32.980\n we grab a TV, we attack it.\n\n20:32.980 --> 20:35.260\n We break into a sneaker store in Melrose.\n\n20:35.260 --> 20:39.780\n We do, it's just like, ah, we still giant cause statues\n\n20:39.780 --> 20:43.140\n where the value of that is completely market driven.\n\n20:43.140 --> 20:45.940\n Like it's just a piece of polypropylene or whatever,\n\n20:45.940 --> 20:48.260\n butyl and you know, it's cool.\n\n20:48.260 --> 20:51.700\n I'm a big fan of art, but it's like,\n\n20:53.460 --> 20:54.780\n you know, I can't eat that.\n\n20:54.780 --> 20:56.220\n And at the end of the day, man,\n\n20:56.220 --> 20:57.780\n you're sitting there with your, like,\n\n20:57.780 --> 20:58.740\n what'd you do today, honey?\n\n20:58.740 --> 20:59.580\n What'd you get?\n\n20:59.580 --> 21:01.260\n You know, man, we were able to, you know,\n\n21:01.260 --> 21:04.180\n oh, I got this, I got this designer art statue.\n\n21:04.180 --> 21:07.780\n Are you going to go, well, you can't really sell it\n\n21:07.780 --> 21:09.460\n on the, on like the art markets\n\n21:09.460 --> 21:10.740\n where people were really going to pay for it.\n\n21:10.740 --> 21:12.980\n So are you going to become an underground art dealer\n\n21:12.980 --> 21:15.060\n with your one piece of cause art?\n\n21:15.060 --> 21:17.460\n One interesting thing you just said before I forget it,\n\n21:17.460 --> 21:21.180\n you mentioned the library of Alexandria and your.\n\n21:21.180 --> 21:22.340\n Phone.\n\n21:22.340 --> 21:25.100\n Well, your phone, but also just thinking\n\n21:25.100 --> 21:27.220\n of your little world that you're creating\n\n21:27.220 --> 21:28.300\n for yourself on the internet.\n\n21:28.300 --> 21:30.580\n That's a really powerful way to actually phrase it.\n\n21:30.580 --> 21:33.380\n One of the things that you've been on Joe Rogan\n\n21:33.380 --> 21:34.220\n several times.\n\n21:34.220 --> 21:35.460\n Although everybody always comes to me and go,\n\n21:35.460 --> 21:36.300\n oh, that was so great.\n\n21:36.300 --> 21:38.420\n I didn't know you, you're on, you've on Joe Rogan.\n\n21:38.420 --> 21:40.260\n I go, this is like my fifth time, dude.\n\n21:40.260 --> 21:42.140\n I've been a fan of yours for a long time\n\n21:42.140 --> 21:45.180\n from other avenues.\n\n21:45.180 --> 21:46.740\n This is a long time coming actually.\n\n21:46.740 --> 21:48.140\n Everybody, you have no idea.\n\n21:48.140 --> 21:51.620\n Like how many times through messaging\n\n21:51.620 --> 21:54.020\n and missing each other over the years.\n\n21:54.020 --> 21:54.860\n This is ridiculous.\n\n21:54.860 --> 21:56.140\n This is a long time coming.\n\n21:56.140 --> 21:58.140\n You don't realize how special this is for us.\n\n21:58.140 --> 22:00.020\n This is, well, I'm also starstruck.\n\n22:00.020 --> 22:00.940\n We'll talk about this,\n\n22:00.940 --> 22:04.020\n but you symbolize something very important to me\n\n22:04.020 --> 22:06.460\n through my journey, through wrestling,\n\n22:06.460 --> 22:08.220\n through Jiu Jitsu, through Judo,\n\n22:08.220 --> 22:11.420\n through just street fighting, through just combat.\n\n22:11.420 --> 22:14.060\n There's a, you're the, in some sense,\n\n22:14.060 --> 22:17.660\n the devil on my shoulder of like, of violence.\n\n22:17.660 --> 22:22.260\n In a good, in a, devil gets a bad rap.\n\n22:22.260 --> 22:23.260\n He does get a bad rap.\n\n22:23.260 --> 22:25.980\n I realize, you know, sitting encased in ice\n\n22:25.980 --> 22:28.220\n down at that low ass level, you know.\n\n22:28.220 --> 22:29.060\n Yeah.\n\n22:29.060 --> 22:32.700\n But, you know, the angel side is more like the athletic,\n\n22:32.700 --> 22:35.500\n the sport, the science, the technical,\n\n22:35.500 --> 22:36.540\n the chess side of things.\n\n22:36.540 --> 22:39.620\n So, but on the library, Alexander, let me ask,\n\n22:41.660 --> 22:43.220\n because you were on Joe Rogan,\n\n22:44.340 --> 22:46.380\n it does make me really sad.\n\n22:46.380 --> 22:48.540\n And I realize that I'm just probably being romantic\n\n22:48.540 --> 22:53.260\n that his, most of his library of interviews\n\n22:53.260 --> 22:56.660\n that were on YouTube have now been taken down\n\n22:56.660 --> 22:58.300\n because he went to Spotify.\n\n22:58.300 --> 23:00.420\n And that was the first, I'm probably an idiot,\n\n23:00.420 --> 23:03.020\n but it was the first time I realized\n\n23:03.020 --> 23:05.220\n that this knowledge that we've been building up\n\n23:05.220 --> 23:08.340\n on the internet doesn't necessarily last forever.\n\n23:08.340 --> 23:10.420\n No, it doesn't, unless you preserve it.\n\n23:10.420 --> 23:11.820\n I mean, it's like all things.\n\n23:11.820 --> 23:16.620\n If you do not preserve them, if you do not make efforts,\n\n23:16.620 --> 23:19.260\n you know, so many of my, it just really brings\n\n23:19.260 --> 23:20.660\n the minor off the top of my head.\n\n23:20.660 --> 23:23.620\n All my, so many friends of mine that are Jewish,\n\n23:25.140 --> 23:27.420\n you know, they're basically secular.\n\n23:27.420 --> 23:31.700\n But yet through even the secular aspect\n\n23:31.700 --> 23:33.660\n of just keeping the traditions alive, it's like,\n\n23:33.660 --> 23:37.060\n well, you could always pick a book and read about it.\n\n23:37.060 --> 23:39.380\n Clearly, it's called the Torah.\n\n23:39.380 --> 23:44.340\n But if you don't put these things into action,\n\n23:44.340 --> 23:48.580\n if you don't make them a part of your consciousness,\n\n23:48.580 --> 23:50.220\n maybe even on the subconsciousness,\n\n23:50.220 --> 23:53.620\n just through repetition, they will die.\n\n23:53.620 --> 23:57.140\n They will become simply something that exists somewhere\n\n23:57.140 --> 23:58.980\n until you find it again.\n\n23:58.980 --> 24:00.780\n And Carl Gotch used to say something,\n\n24:02.020 --> 24:03.900\n he would say that I don't invent moves,\n\n24:03.900 --> 24:05.780\n I just rediscover them.\n\n24:05.780 --> 24:10.460\n But yet Gotch and Billy Robinson also would understand\n\n24:11.380 --> 24:15.820\n that you, if someone's not carrying the torch,\n\n24:15.820 --> 24:16.780\n it'll go out.\n\n24:16.780 --> 24:18.740\n Now that doesn't mean fire can't be rekindled.\n\n24:18.740 --> 24:21.780\n It just means that it, that torch no longer\n\n24:21.780 --> 24:24.340\n is lighting the way on this knowledge.\n\n24:24.340 --> 24:29.340\n And so it's important to be an individual,\n\n24:29.980 --> 24:31.460\n even on an individual level,\n\n24:31.460 --> 24:35.740\n to be a repository for aspects of knowledge.\n\n24:35.740 --> 24:37.180\n You mentioned Gotch.\n\n24:37.180 --> 24:42.180\n You consider yourself a catch wrestler.\n\n24:44.500 --> 24:47.020\n So I've mentioned to you offline that I competed\n\n24:47.020 --> 24:49.180\n in a couple of catch wrestling tournaments.\n\n24:49.180 --> 24:52.300\n Can we go Wikipedia level at the very basic,\n\n24:52.300 --> 24:54.340\n you're the exactly right person to ask,\n\n24:54.340 --> 24:56.340\n what is catch wrestling?\n\n24:56.340 --> 24:58.580\n And what are its defining principles?\n\n24:58.580 --> 25:02.660\n I would say the easiest way for us to talk about\n\n25:02.660 --> 25:07.660\n and give an overview of what catch is\n\n25:07.780 --> 25:12.140\n in the simplest terms is think of collegiate wrestling\n\n25:12.140 --> 25:13.820\n with submissions.\n\n25:13.820 --> 25:15.780\n That is essentially what catch is.\n\n25:15.780 --> 25:18.260\n And it's not surprising because collegiate wrestling\n\n25:18.260 --> 25:21.460\n is actually derived from catch as catch can.\n\n25:21.460 --> 25:23.980\n It's just that over time certain aspects\n\n25:23.980 --> 25:28.980\n were removed from the competition structure\n\n25:29.020 --> 25:31.260\n so that they became null elements,\n\n25:31.260 --> 25:33.260\n things that were discarded.\n\n25:33.260 --> 25:36.900\n But it's funny that you can take a high level\n\n25:38.140 --> 25:42.500\n amateur collegiate types and you can show them a move\n\n25:42.500 --> 25:44.500\n and then add a little bit to it and go,\n\n25:44.500 --> 25:47.140\n oh, well, hey, that was just like what we already do here,\n\n25:47.140 --> 25:49.740\n but except, oh, I didn't know you could take it\n\n25:49.740 --> 25:50.620\n all the way to this point.\n\n25:50.620 --> 25:53.020\n Or things of that nature,\n\n25:53.020 --> 25:55.340\n especially when it comes to professional wrestling,\n\n25:55.340 --> 25:58.820\n teaching people like, no, I know you're just using this\n\n25:58.820 --> 26:00.740\n in a show, but this is actually a real move\n\n26:00.740 --> 26:02.140\n and here's how it really feels.\n\n26:02.140 --> 26:04.940\n And so collegiate wrestling and wrestling in general\n\n26:04.940 --> 26:07.180\n for people who are not aware is basically\n\n26:07.180 --> 26:10.540\n two people start on their feet and they have to score,\n\n26:10.540 --> 26:12.140\n they're trying to take each other down\n\n26:12.140 --> 26:15.860\n and they score points along the way.\n\n26:15.860 --> 26:18.300\n You can end matches by pinning them,\n\n26:18.300 --> 26:20.440\n for example, on their back.\n\n26:20.440 --> 26:23.340\n I think one way to describe wrestling\n\n26:23.340 --> 26:27.060\n is it's very much about figuring out ways\n\n26:27.060 --> 26:29.160\n to establish control and leverage\n\n26:29.160 --> 26:33.540\n in these kind of tie ups,\n\n26:33.540 --> 26:35.720\n or there's different styles where you can do more\n\n26:35.720 --> 26:38.020\n from a distance to where it's more about the timing\n\n26:38.020 --> 26:39.560\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n26:39.560 --> 26:42.820\n Ultimately, it's an art of like both upper body\n\n26:42.820 --> 26:45.180\n and lower body and you could choose the different puzzles\n\n26:45.180 --> 26:46.380\n that you solve there.\n\n26:46.380 --> 26:49.580\n You could be attacking the head, the arms,\n\n26:49.580 --> 26:51.400\n you could be attacking the legs.\n\n26:51.400 --> 26:53.180\n There's also part of collegiate wrestling\n\n26:53.180 --> 26:56.340\n that's on the ground that has more,\n\n26:56.340 --> 26:58.740\n what's called like a referee's position or whatever.\n\n26:58.740 --> 27:01.180\n The referee's position where you're on your hands\n\n27:01.180 --> 27:02.460\n and knees basically.\n\n27:02.460 --> 27:04.020\n And so.\n\n27:04.020 --> 27:06.420\n Do you understand what that's supposed to simulate?\n\n27:06.420 --> 27:08.500\n Why is that one of the standard positions?\n\n27:08.500 --> 27:10.540\n It's one of the standard positions because one,\n\n27:10.540 --> 27:13.220\n it's one of the easiest ways to actually get up,\n\n27:13.220 --> 27:15.980\n but two, it's because you cannot be on your back.\n\n27:15.980 --> 27:17.940\n If you're on your back, you're getting pinned.\n\n27:17.940 --> 27:22.100\n And back exposure or being pinned\n\n27:22.100 --> 27:26.860\n is pretty much the universal wrestling thing.\n\n27:26.860 --> 27:30.860\n One, taking the guy from their feet to the floor\n\n27:30.860 --> 27:33.780\n and two, pinning them.\n\n27:33.780 --> 27:36.120\n As you go from like, what is it?\n\n27:37.340 --> 27:42.220\n Cornish wrestling, Turkish oil wrestling, Mongolian, Sumo,\n\n27:43.460 --> 27:46.500\n Indian, well, they'll call it Palwani.\n\n27:46.500 --> 27:51.380\n It's also called Kushti, Jiu Jitsu, Judo.\n\n27:52.500 --> 27:54.740\n So many of them is like, there's a,\n\n27:54.740 --> 27:58.020\n you sombo, even if it doesn't end the match,\n\n27:58.020 --> 28:00.500\n it's still like one of the most important aspects\n\n28:00.500 --> 28:05.220\n of the competition itself, across almost every style.\n\n28:05.220 --> 28:07.860\n And this is where submission, like catch wrestling\n\n28:07.860 --> 28:12.500\n or submission wrestling or Jiu Jitsu feels different,\n\n28:12.500 --> 28:14.980\n which it seems like for most wrestling,\n\n28:14.980 --> 28:19.820\n for a lot of wrestling, the dominance is the goal,\n\n28:20.740 --> 28:23.460\n as opposed to submission,\n\n28:23.460 --> 28:25.340\n which I guess those are two are related,\n\n28:25.340 --> 28:27.340\n but dominating the position.\n\n28:27.340 --> 28:28.420\n So that's what pinning is.\n\n28:28.420 --> 28:31.860\n It's almost like breaking your opponent,\n\n28:32.620 --> 28:36.060\n like breaking through all of their defenses\n\n28:36.060 --> 28:37.580\n to where they're completely defenses\n\n28:37.580 --> 28:39.180\n and you could do anything with them that you want.\n\n28:39.180 --> 28:41.900\n Maybe that's what could be a definition of dominance.\n\n28:41.900 --> 28:42.740\n I don't know.\n\n28:42.740 --> 28:46.500\n I mean, it sounds very much like a chain to a radiator.\n\n28:46.500 --> 28:47.340\n Yeah.\n\n28:48.740 --> 28:52.340\n Yeah, there's a threat that connects all runners,\n\n28:52.340 --> 28:54.260\n but submission feels different.\n\n28:55.580 --> 28:57.300\n It is actually different when you think about it\n\n28:57.300 --> 28:58.940\n across the landscape.\n\n28:58.940 --> 29:00.220\n I don't think radically different,\n\n29:00.220 --> 29:01.580\n but just still slightly different.\n\n29:01.580 --> 29:03.900\n And that if you think of wrestling\n\n29:03.900 --> 29:07.620\n as being derived from combat, right?\n\n29:07.620 --> 29:11.940\n So, well, it is combat sports, but more lethal combat.\n\n29:11.940 --> 29:14.540\n Getting somebody off their feet and onto their back\n\n29:14.540 --> 29:15.940\n is about as lethal a place\n\n29:15.940 --> 29:18.500\n for the person on bottom to be in general.\n\n29:18.500 --> 29:22.420\n I mean, don't come at me with your talks\n\n29:22.420 --> 29:25.380\n about your fucking worm guards and blah, blah, blah,\n\n29:25.380 --> 29:29.140\n and whatever spider, bear, okay, get out of here with that.\n\n29:29.140 --> 29:30.740\n We're not talking about you\n\n29:30.740 --> 29:34.260\n in this highly regimented sporting environment.\n\n29:34.260 --> 29:37.740\n We're talking about general, all the body hair,\n\n29:37.740 --> 29:39.580\n none of the waxing human beings.\n\n29:39.580 --> 29:44.300\n So getting someone on their back,\n\n29:44.300 --> 29:46.940\n okay, as you're trying to get up,\n\n29:46.940 --> 29:48.620\n you're getting hit with a rock or stabbed\n\n29:48.620 --> 29:52.580\n or what have you set on fire, who knows?\n\n29:52.580 --> 29:55.340\n Generally, these conflicts are not just isolated\n\n29:55.340 --> 29:57.140\n to one on one.\n\n29:57.140 --> 29:58.540\n If it's four on two,\n\n29:58.540 --> 30:01.900\n your buddy that was with you back to back,\n\n30:01.900 --> 30:03.180\n now he's on his back.\n\n30:03.180 --> 30:04.020\n What do you think?\n\n30:04.020 --> 30:06.580\n And now it's gonna be one on one while three go on one.\n\n30:06.580 --> 30:10.900\n So, and then you elevate this to armored combat, right?\n\n30:10.900 --> 30:12.460\n And it's boom, put them on the ground.\n\n30:12.460 --> 30:13.660\n Oh, crap, it's hard to get up.\n\n30:13.660 --> 30:16.260\n Well, while you're struggling to get up, stab.\n\n30:16.260 --> 30:18.820\n That's where jujitsu's concepts come from\n\n30:18.820 --> 30:20.860\n with all their leveraging and off balancing is,\n\n30:20.860 --> 30:23.140\n oh man, if I end up in this situation\n\n30:23.140 --> 30:24.660\n in tight close quarters combat,\n\n30:24.660 --> 30:27.100\n yes, we could fight it out with swords and knives\n\n30:27.100 --> 30:29.820\n and what have you, but it's way easier\n\n30:29.820 --> 30:33.900\n if the first thing I can do is foot sweep you on your back\n\n30:33.900 --> 30:36.340\n and then pull my knife and just go stick.\n\n30:36.340 --> 30:40.020\n Is there a thread that connects all of these different arts\n\n30:40.020 --> 30:45.020\n from not just arts, but from the very base violence of war,\n\n30:45.380 --> 30:47.740\n just like you said that there's no rules\n\n30:47.740 --> 30:52.300\n to the very regimented IBJF.\n\n30:52.300 --> 30:53.140\n I do.\n\n30:53.140 --> 30:54.300\n Jiu Jitsu tournaments and just,\n\n30:54.300 --> 30:55.580\n you've kind of laid out some of it,\n\n30:55.580 --> 30:57.460\n but can you go all the way to the.\n\n30:57.460 --> 31:01.100\n So when you start off with absolute skills\n\n31:01.100 --> 31:04.180\n in the sense of absolute offense and defense\n\n31:04.180 --> 31:07.220\n in the taking or preserving of life, right?\n\n31:07.220 --> 31:12.220\n Full on at its purest form of self defense\n\n31:13.060 --> 31:15.420\n and self preservation, okay?\n\n31:15.420 --> 31:18.620\n And then you extrapolate part of that\n\n31:18.620 --> 31:23.540\n in that all animals train in violence.\n\n31:23.540 --> 31:25.940\n All play usually degenerates\n\n31:25.940 --> 31:27.900\n into some sort of soft violence.\n\n31:27.900 --> 31:30.940\n So be it cats when they're kittens and puppies\n\n31:30.940 --> 31:34.420\n and everything learns how to kill, how to fight.\n\n31:34.420 --> 31:39.420\n Not that, you know, just that dumb alpha meme stuff\n\n31:39.980 --> 31:42.140\n where the idea is that, oh, by being alpha,\n\n31:42.140 --> 31:44.220\n that means you run around like basically just being a bully\n\n31:44.220 --> 31:45.060\n and a shithead.\n\n31:45.060 --> 31:50.060\n No, actually alpha wolves spend very little time fighting\n\n31:50.060 --> 31:52.340\n because if you were actually alpha,\n\n31:52.340 --> 31:55.900\n you don't get into fights, there's no need to.\n\n31:55.900 --> 31:58.380\n And if you're probably getting\n\n31:58.380 --> 32:00.180\n into any large amount of fights,\n\n32:00.180 --> 32:02.660\n it's probably because you're being shitty at being an alpha\n\n32:02.660 --> 32:05.220\n and now people are tired of you being in charge.\n\n32:06.580 --> 32:08.620\n And yet in the animal world,\n\n32:08.620 --> 32:10.660\n and it would be the same for human beings\n\n32:10.660 --> 32:14.460\n at that base beginning level of violence,\n\n32:15.420 --> 32:17.020\n there's a big risk.\n\n32:17.020 --> 32:21.020\n So I know that we live in this place with healthcare\n\n32:21.020 --> 32:23.980\n or you might be in a place with nationalized health,\n\n32:23.980 --> 32:24.820\n whatever, right?\n\n32:24.820 --> 32:29.820\n So there's band aids, there's penicillin,\n\n32:30.140 --> 32:32.380\n there's all that kind of stuff.\n\n32:32.380 --> 32:36.820\n But that's not the normal way of things, you know?\n\n32:36.820 --> 32:40.540\n Yeah, there's a channel that just hurts me every time.\n\n32:40.540 --> 32:42.980\n I used to follow it and I had to unfollow it\n\n32:42.980 --> 32:44.620\n because it was too painful for me as a human being\n\n32:44.620 --> 32:47.260\n called Nature is Metal on Instagram.\n\n32:47.260 --> 32:51.300\n It was sobering and then it was like, this is too sobering.\n\n32:51.300 --> 32:52.860\n It's very sobering.\n\n32:52.860 --> 32:56.500\n So in there, the risk is at its highest level.\n\n32:56.500 --> 33:01.500\n The damage you take, the winner walks away hurt.\n\n33:02.620 --> 33:06.460\n Getting lamed when you need every aspect\n\n33:06.460 --> 33:10.780\n of your physical and athletic faculties to survive\n\n33:10.780 --> 33:13.900\n because this isn't the first\n\n33:13.900 --> 33:15.540\n and it's definitely not gonna be the last,\n\n33:15.540 --> 33:17.340\n especially if you're the slowest one.\n\n33:17.340 --> 33:22.340\n What is it, there's a lyric from a clutch song.\n\n33:23.740 --> 33:26.780\n Don't go for the fat ones, just go for the slow ones.\n\n33:26.780 --> 33:31.660\n Oh man, but that's the universal truth\n\n33:31.660 --> 33:33.540\n of the way nature works.\n\n33:33.540 --> 33:35.460\n You said it's not cruel, it's not cruel,\n\n33:35.460 --> 33:36.300\n it's just the way it is.\n\n33:36.300 --> 33:39.020\n Yeah, I mean, watch animals getting into fights\n\n33:39.020 --> 33:41.900\n on any of these sort of documentary stuff.\n\n33:41.900 --> 33:46.020\n You'll see an intense short and then dispersal.\n\n33:46.020 --> 33:49.020\n You'll see as soon as one feels like things have switched\n\n33:49.020 --> 33:51.980\n just enough to boom, the bear or whatever it is takes off.\n\n33:51.980 --> 33:53.700\n It's like, I'm done with this.\n\n33:53.700 --> 33:56.380\n Because if you can get out of there with just some scars\n\n33:56.380 --> 33:58.220\n and what have you, okay.\n\n33:58.220 --> 34:01.420\n You lose an eye, nah, it's not as good.\n\n34:01.420 --> 34:04.940\n You really get hurt bad and get infected, you're done.\n\n34:04.940 --> 34:07.780\n So there's a serious risk to be\n\n34:09.140 --> 34:10.820\n that can come with these sort of things.\n\n34:10.820 --> 34:15.820\n Yet, I believe that we are inherently born\n\n34:16.300 --> 34:19.820\n for at least aspects of and use of violence.\n\n34:19.820 --> 34:23.620\n And so at the end of the day, we need these things\n\n34:23.620 --> 34:26.180\n not just to, not just survive each other,\n\n34:26.180 --> 34:30.420\n but they're a part of being able to hunt and other things.\n\n34:31.580 --> 34:33.300\n So violence is a part of human nature.\n\n34:33.300 --> 34:36.060\n Violence is, it's an absolute.\n\n34:36.060 --> 34:38.700\n It is in every person, it is a part of every interaction,\n\n34:38.700 --> 34:41.660\n it is a part of every law, everything.\n\n34:41.660 --> 34:43.900\n And I'm not, by the way, I'm not an ANCAP.\n\n34:43.900 --> 34:47.060\n So don't even, don't hit your wagon to me on that one.\n\n34:47.060 --> 34:50.700\n ANCAP is anarchic capitalist. Anarchic capitalist, yes.\n\n34:50.700 --> 34:52.420\n Not an ANCAP.\n\n34:52.420 --> 34:54.420\n They have nice book shops.\n\n34:54.420 --> 34:55.260\n Yeah, they do.\n\n34:55.260 --> 34:59.460\n I mean, I'm not gonna sit here and shit talk ANCAPs.\n\n34:59.460 --> 35:01.540\n Although I also used to get into the conversations\n\n35:01.540 --> 35:06.540\n with an ANCOM, anarcho communist, a good friend of mine.\n\n35:06.540 --> 35:09.380\n And he would bring up this stuff and I'm like,\n\n35:09.380 --> 35:11.980\n yeah, cool, man, I'm down with anarchy.\n\n35:11.980 --> 35:13.540\n You ain't gonna like it.\n\n35:13.540 --> 35:14.380\n What do you mean?\n\n35:14.380 --> 35:15.580\n I go, cause I'm gonna take all,\n\n35:15.580 --> 35:17.220\n I'm gonna gather all kinds of people together.\n\n35:17.220 --> 35:19.020\n I'm gonna make this, I'm gonna get the strongest together\n\n35:19.020 --> 35:20.780\n and I'm going to take your shit.\n\n35:20.780 --> 35:23.620\n Okay, can I ask you on that topic,\n\n35:23.620 --> 35:25.860\n I have a friend of mine now,\n\n35:27.220 --> 35:32.220\n a fellow Russian, Ukrainian, Michael Malice.\n\n35:32.220 --> 35:34.060\n Oh, yeah, I'm familiar with Michael Malice.\n\n35:34.060 --> 35:35.540\n I watched a little bit of your guy's show.\n\n35:35.540 --> 35:38.620\n I watched a little bit of your guy's conversation.\n\n35:38.620 --> 35:42.540\n So this is really good to ask you because...\n\n35:42.540 --> 35:44.900\n I like how he's in the white suit\n\n35:44.900 --> 35:46.780\n and you're in the white and black.\n\n35:46.780 --> 35:49.540\n But he lives in New York City.\n\n35:49.540 --> 35:54.540\n He espouses ideas of anarchism and his idea,\n\n35:54.940 --> 35:59.940\n and this is different than sort of the Ayn Rand set of ideas\n\n36:00.460 --> 36:02.660\n that there's a line between sort of capitalism\n\n36:02.660 --> 36:05.620\n that's backed by the state and just pure anarchism.\n\n36:06.500 --> 36:11.500\n And his idea that violence won't take over in an anarchism\n\n36:13.020 --> 36:18.020\n is one that feels to me not grounded in reality.\n\n36:18.220 --> 36:19.620\n I may be wrong.\n\n36:19.620 --> 36:24.620\n So is there some, so the idea with pure capitalism is that...\n\n36:24.860 --> 36:27.700\n You mean laissez faire, completely deregulated?\n\n36:27.700 --> 36:28.540\n Yeah.\n\n36:28.540 --> 36:31.260\n Yeah, well, what it will agree, it'll end up in one,\n\n36:31.260 --> 36:34.180\n it'll end up in, if you're anti globalist,\n\n36:34.180 --> 36:35.620\n it's gonna be that.\n\n36:35.620 --> 36:40.060\n It's gonna be globalist 100% because it has no...\n\n36:40.060 --> 36:45.060\n Pure capitalism has no consideration for your native users\n\n36:47.980 --> 36:50.940\n or of any sort, like it doesn't matter.\n\n36:50.940 --> 36:53.220\n But the idea of governments is that the land,\n\n36:53.220 --> 36:56.300\n the little piece of land geographically you're born on\n\n36:56.300 --> 36:57.420\n means you're going to stick\n\n36:57.420 --> 37:01.020\n to whatever founding documents created that little land.\n\n37:01.020 --> 37:04.060\n So anarchism is against that.\n\n37:04.060 --> 37:06.220\n And the argument is you should be able to choose\n\n37:06.220 --> 37:08.980\n which ideas you live with.\n\n37:08.980 --> 37:12.300\n And the concern there is nobody,\n\n37:12.300 --> 37:15.860\n this geographical land, the governments\n\n37:15.860 --> 37:18.020\n that organize on that land\n\n37:19.660 --> 37:21.820\n do not need to protect you from the violence.\n\n37:21.820 --> 37:23.980\n And my sense is there does need to be an army,\n\n37:23.980 --> 37:27.580\n there does need to be police that help,\n\n37:27.580 --> 37:29.420\n however the form that police takes.\n\n37:29.420 --> 37:33.020\n But there needs to be a more centralized,\n\n37:33.020 --> 37:33.980\n not completely centralized,\n\n37:33.980 --> 37:38.260\n but more centralized safety net\n\n37:38.260 --> 37:39.380\n to protect you from the violence.\n\n37:39.380 --> 37:40.460\n Scale again, right?\n\n37:40.460 --> 37:44.780\n So if you want to have your anarchist utopia,\n\n37:44.780 --> 37:46.300\n well, we won't call it utopia,\n\n37:46.300 --> 37:49.140\n your anarchist creation here.\n\n37:50.220 --> 37:52.540\n At certain scale, I'm sure it's doable.\n\n37:54.900 --> 37:58.420\n But as it scales, as the scale increases,\n\n37:58.420 --> 38:00.260\n it's completely untenable.\n\n38:00.260 --> 38:02.060\n And a state will emerge.\n\n38:02.060 --> 38:03.340\n A state will always emerge.\n\n38:03.340 --> 38:05.980\n Because even people always think of states\n\n38:05.980 --> 38:07.860\n as like people rubbing their hands\n\n38:07.860 --> 38:09.700\n and smoking cigars in back rooms\n\n38:09.700 --> 38:11.420\n and just out of nowhere coming around\n\n38:11.420 --> 38:12.620\n and just like, oh, we're going to create\n\n38:12.620 --> 38:13.740\n this big centralized thing\n\n38:13.740 --> 38:15.860\n and just so that we can tell everybody what to do\n\n38:15.860 --> 38:17.900\n and we can be in charge.\n\n38:17.900 --> 38:20.940\n I mean, I know that there are people like that that exist,\n\n38:20.940 --> 38:23.260\n that they would like to do things of that nature\n\n38:23.260 --> 38:26.740\n and that they see the use of power\n\n38:26.740 --> 38:31.740\n as something to be used more for their personal gains\n\n38:32.140 --> 38:36.140\n over first, which again, self interest in human beings.\n\n38:36.140 --> 38:41.140\n But eventually a state, people want,\n\n38:41.220 --> 38:44.340\n they want something to go like, okay,\n\n38:44.340 --> 38:45.420\n who's taking care of this?\n\n38:45.420 --> 38:46.460\n And who's taking care of that?\n\n38:46.460 --> 38:51.460\n And how do we create some sort of protocol for this?\n\n38:53.260 --> 38:55.220\n Like, okay, well, when it's not Bob,\n\n38:55.220 --> 38:56.940\n when is it Susie, when is it whatever?\n\n38:56.940 --> 38:59.740\n I mean, like, how do we, it's gotta get done\n\n38:59.740 --> 39:01.140\n if we want this thing to become bigger,\n\n39:01.140 --> 39:04.540\n if we want all of our plumbing to work right,\n\n39:04.540 --> 39:06.940\n if we want, it's just, I'm sorry, a state's gonna happen.\n\n39:06.940 --> 39:10.740\n A state is also, when you think about it,\n\n39:10.740 --> 39:13.580\n it's supposed to have consideration to tribe, right?\n\n39:13.580 --> 39:15.900\n So if people think that we're not tribes,\n\n39:15.900 --> 39:18.980\n well, you're not really thinking very deeply.\n\n39:18.980 --> 39:20.660\n We're all tribes of a sort.\n\n39:20.660 --> 39:23.980\n And everybody likes to use the word tribalism\n\n39:23.980 --> 39:28.100\n in this idea of this antagonistic concept.\n\n39:28.100 --> 39:30.540\n And while sure, tribalism can be antagonistic,\n\n39:30.540 --> 39:33.500\n tribalism can also be a positive thing,\n\n39:33.500 --> 39:36.100\n or I could just say, it just seems to be a natural thing.\n\n39:36.100 --> 39:40.180\n People, they create their groups of one sort or another.\n\n39:40.180 --> 39:45.180\n And so when you have, well, when you think about\n\n39:45.260 --> 39:47.820\n when nation states really started to become a thing,\n\n39:47.820 --> 39:52.180\n and I don't mean even the more modern looking variants\n\n39:52.180 --> 39:54.660\n that we could think back up and say the 19th century\n\n39:54.660 --> 39:57.500\n or something like that, even older than that.\n\n39:57.500 --> 39:58.500\n I mean, you think the Assyrians\n\n39:58.500 --> 40:00.140\n didn't have a state of some sort?\n\n40:00.140 --> 40:01.060\n Of course they did.\n\n40:02.220 --> 40:05.140\n How do you increase your empire\n\n40:05.140 --> 40:07.340\n if you don't actually have a place to start from?\n\n40:07.340 --> 40:08.180\n Just to be a ruler.\n\n40:08.180 --> 40:09.820\n So you're saying like naturally,\n\n40:09.820 --> 40:13.180\n when you start talking and thinking about scale of humans,\n\n40:13.180 --> 40:16.380\n naturally states emerge.\n\n40:16.380 --> 40:20.780\n And so can we try to make an argument for anarchism,\n\n40:20.780 --> 40:25.780\n which is, so anarchy in a sense is an opposition\n\n40:29.980 --> 40:34.140\n to the unhelpful, unproductive, inefficient bureaucracies\n\n40:34.140 --> 40:37.020\n that eventually the states lead to.\n\n40:37.020 --> 40:38.980\n Yes, and that's what we can see.\n\n40:38.980 --> 40:41.860\n I mean, I would say less anarchy,\n\n40:41.860 --> 40:46.860\n more study James Burnham, you know,\n\n40:46.860 --> 40:51.860\n or, well, anybody that wants to talk\n\n40:52.900 --> 40:55.180\n about the managerial problem and the managerial.\n\n40:55.180 --> 40:58.940\n I see, so you have a sense, a hope,\n\n40:58.940 --> 41:01.300\n maybe let's think like what is the path forward\n\n41:01.300 --> 41:04.140\n with the inefficient state?\n\n41:04.140 --> 41:07.460\n Is it revolution or is it to work within the system\n\n41:07.460 --> 41:09.020\n to constantly improve it, to manage better?\n\n41:09.020 --> 41:10.260\n Man, I don't know that one.\n\n41:10.260 --> 41:12.620\n I mean, my general sense,\n\n41:12.620 --> 41:14.460\n and maybe this is the Nietzschean part of me,\n\n41:14.460 --> 41:18.860\n is that, yeah, it would take maybe not even just,\n\n41:18.860 --> 41:22.060\n maybe not even defining it specifically as revolution.\n\n41:22.060 --> 41:24.980\n Maybe it would just take just total calamity\n\n41:24.980 --> 41:28.220\n to get people to stop being shitty,\n\n41:28.220 --> 41:30.540\n to not stop being a lesser version of themselves,\n\n41:30.540 --> 41:34.140\n to stop thinking more about things\n\n41:34.140 --> 41:37.780\n from the paradigm that we exist in now,\n\n41:37.780 --> 41:39.980\n where we're giving so much value to stuff\n\n41:39.980 --> 41:41.940\n that isn't really all that valuable.\n\n41:41.940 --> 41:45.100\n Where we're so concerned about likes,\n\n41:45.100 --> 41:47.580\n and I don't just mean like whether we get them or not,\n\n41:47.580 --> 41:50.380\n but that, oh man, maybe we should take this off\n\n41:50.380 --> 41:51.220\n of our platform,\n\n41:51.220 --> 41:53.220\n because this is too destabilizing to people.\n\n41:53.220 --> 41:54.860\n Because once you exceed Dunbar's number,\n\n41:54.860 --> 41:56.780\n I think it's actually,\n\n41:56.780 --> 41:59.980\n without having the right faculties,\n\n42:00.940 --> 42:03.380\n which would need to be developed,\n\n42:03.380 --> 42:08.140\n because this is dealing with tech that brings things,\n\n42:08.140 --> 42:12.340\n ways of approaching being that we are not\n\n42:12.340 --> 42:17.340\n naturally programmed to be able to handle appropriately.\n\n42:18.300 --> 42:23.300\n And I think it's even more detrimental to women than men,\n\n42:23.940 --> 42:27.700\n because I think women have a more natural proclivity\n\n42:27.700 --> 42:32.340\n towards group association\n\n42:32.340 --> 42:37.340\n and more group oriented thinking and patterning.\n\n42:38.220 --> 42:41.060\n And now, and with also coupled with\n\n42:42.380 --> 42:47.380\n seemingly more sensitivity towards human states.\n\n42:49.660 --> 42:52.780\n So I feel like women, like the classic idea is like,\n\n42:52.780 --> 42:53.940\n oh, you know, women are psychic,\n\n42:53.940 --> 42:55.380\n you know, they have a sixth sense and what have you.\n\n42:55.380 --> 43:02.380\n And I think that's just a way of simplifying,\n\n43:02.980 --> 43:05.220\n what I think is that women may be more in tune\n\n43:05.220 --> 43:07.540\n with picking up on the unsaid.\n\n43:07.540 --> 43:12.540\n Like they might be better at seeing physical cues,\n\n43:12.700 --> 43:14.220\n inflection and tone, like different,\n\n43:14.220 --> 43:16.540\n like they may be far more sensitive to these things,\n\n43:16.540 --> 43:17.580\n which to me would make sense,\n\n43:17.580 --> 43:22.580\n because dealing with children that can't communicate.\n\n43:22.580 --> 43:27.580\n So distinctively, right now, okay.\n\n43:27.780 --> 43:29.860\n Now, whether it be a woman or a man,\n\n43:29.860 --> 43:34.340\n but especially with even the social push\n\n43:34.340 --> 43:36.300\n on this concept of empathy,\n\n43:36.300 --> 43:37.460\n which of course it gets to the point\n\n43:37.460 --> 43:39.260\n where it loses any meaning anymore.\n\n43:39.260 --> 43:41.060\n Like people use the word empathy\n\n43:41.060 --> 43:42.580\n absolutely incorrectly all the time.\n\n43:42.580 --> 43:44.140\n And they don't even understand\n\n43:44.140 --> 43:47.020\n what you're really asking of people.\n\n43:47.020 --> 43:49.740\n But let's just take it as we're using empathy\n\n43:49.740 --> 43:50.660\n in the correct sense.\n\n43:50.660 --> 43:53.700\n And you're taking on the emotional content\n\n43:53.700 --> 43:55.300\n of the thing itself.\n\n43:55.300 --> 43:57.940\n Now you open that up to thousands of people,\n\n43:57.940 --> 44:01.420\n maybe hundreds of thousands of people all across the world\n\n44:01.420 --> 44:03.340\n that you will never meet, that you will never know,\n\n44:03.340 --> 44:06.660\n that you're not even getting an actual true representation\n\n44:06.660 --> 44:08.420\n most of the time of who these people are.\n\n44:08.420 --> 44:09.900\n You're meeting persona.\n\n44:10.860 --> 44:15.700\n And some of these personas are even deliberately created\n\n44:15.700 --> 44:20.020\n to elicit a response inauthentically.\n\n44:20.020 --> 44:22.220\n Are you referring to bots or?\n\n44:22.220 --> 44:24.220\n Could be bots or actual people.\n\n44:24.220 --> 44:25.540\n Bots are one thing, but I mean,\n\n44:25.540 --> 44:27.140\n there are literal people out there\n\n44:27.140 --> 44:30.380\n that will create something, create GoFundMes\n\n44:30.380 --> 44:32.420\n for tragedies that never didn't really,\n\n44:32.420 --> 44:36.500\n or events that didn't happen or any number of things.\n\n44:36.500 --> 44:38.540\n Okay, I mean, burn their own house down\n\n44:38.540 --> 44:40.540\n and then say, you know, we were attacked.\n\n44:40.540 --> 44:42.780\n And then it comes down, oh, you did it to yourself\n\n44:42.780 --> 44:45.380\n because you wanted money and empathy and this, that.\n\n44:45.380 --> 44:48.420\n And you wanted all this emotional wealth,\n\n44:48.420 --> 44:51.340\n let's say this emotional coin,\n\n44:51.340 --> 44:52.820\n as well as actual if possible.\n\n44:52.820 --> 44:55.180\n You wanted to leverage it in some way.\n\n44:55.180 --> 44:57.060\n That's not the majority of people,\n\n44:57.060 --> 45:01.020\n but I would say a good amount of folks are thinking,\n\n45:01.020 --> 45:03.900\n well, if I post this photo\n\n45:05.180 --> 45:07.060\n and I put this little blurb in there,\n\n45:07.060 --> 45:10.460\n I bet I can get this much cache out of it in this sense.\n\n45:10.460 --> 45:12.420\n And I'm not even, and this isn't just a reference\n\n45:12.420 --> 45:14.620\n to like butt pics and stuff like that.\n\n45:14.620 --> 45:17.380\n Because clearly, obviously people understand\n\n45:17.380 --> 45:22.380\n that our inborn sexual nature is easy to manipulate.\n\n45:23.340 --> 45:25.660\n I mean, that's pretty obvious.\n\n45:25.660 --> 45:27.740\n But you're saying this kind of new medium\n\n45:27.740 --> 45:32.140\n of communication on social media is unnatural.\n\n45:32.140 --> 45:33.260\n And it preys on us.\n\n45:33.260 --> 45:36.100\n And so as you want this, you know,\n\n45:36.100 --> 45:41.100\n you look at an anarchist kind of mindset, right?\n\n45:41.580 --> 45:44.500\n And so you're just like, there's no,\n\n45:44.500 --> 45:48.820\n there is no overarching state to create\n\n45:48.820 --> 45:51.940\n any kind of a structure, right?\n\n45:51.940 --> 45:55.460\n And so if you have that unfettered capitalism aspect\n\n45:55.460 --> 46:00.060\n with it, and before I say anything particularly damning\n\n46:00.060 --> 46:03.940\n about unfettered capitalism, I'm a massive capitalist\n\n46:03.940 --> 46:06.540\n because I view capitalism essentially as,\n\n46:06.540 --> 46:09.500\n what it boils down to is I get these arguments to people too.\n\n46:09.500 --> 46:11.900\n They start giving me all these extra definitions\n\n46:11.900 --> 46:13.380\n about capitalism like, no, no,\n\n46:13.380 --> 46:15.180\n this is obviously some sort of theory\n\n46:15.180 --> 46:16.220\n you're taking from other shit.\n\n46:16.220 --> 46:17.540\n But that doesn't describe capitalism.\n\n46:17.540 --> 46:22.540\n Capitalism is the ability for us to create whatever we want\n\n46:23.260 --> 46:27.220\n or, you know, create our thoughts, ideas, physical things\n\n46:27.220 --> 46:29.660\n and trade them freely amongst each other\n\n46:29.660 --> 46:34.220\n in ways that we find acceptable, right?\n\n46:34.220 --> 46:36.380\n You know, I'm not even using the word fair\n\n46:36.380 --> 46:39.020\n because I might think it's fair to me.\n\n46:39.020 --> 46:41.300\n You might think, huh, well, I mean, that was actually,\n\n46:41.300 --> 46:43.500\n I think what he thought was unfair to him\n\n46:43.500 --> 46:44.620\n and it's more fair to me.\n\n46:44.620 --> 46:46.580\n And then someone, a third observer goes,\n\n46:46.580 --> 46:49.220\n oh man, you should not have paid that for that.\n\n46:49.220 --> 46:50.060\n You should have paid this.\n\n46:50.060 --> 46:50.900\n And it's like, well, you know what?\n\n46:50.900 --> 46:52.540\n It works for me without...\n\n46:52.540 --> 46:55.340\n Sufficiently acceptable that you both agree\n\n46:55.340 --> 46:56.180\n to the transaction.\n\n46:56.180 --> 46:57.020\n Correct.\n\n46:58.700 --> 47:01.980\n But also at the root of that is freedom, right?\n\n47:01.980 --> 47:03.700\n And as far as I can tell,\n\n47:03.700 --> 47:06.220\n I've been banging this around in my head,\n\n47:06.220 --> 47:09.020\n it's like for every one unit of freedom,\n\n47:09.020 --> 47:11.300\n you need two units of accountability.\n\n47:12.180 --> 47:14.340\n And if you don't have that,\n\n47:14.340 --> 47:19.340\n what you end up with is human self interest.\n\n47:19.980 --> 47:21.420\n We're not even gonna get into evil.\n\n47:21.420 --> 47:24.780\n Human self interest, sabotaging other things,\n\n47:24.780 --> 47:27.020\n even not in a sense to be malicious.\n\n47:27.020 --> 47:28.820\n Okay, so in terms of,\n\n47:28.820 --> 47:31.300\n let's put this as mathematically speaking,\n\n47:31.300 --> 47:32.180\n I love this.\n\n47:32.180 --> 47:35.380\n So anarchism is more like two units of freedom\n\n47:35.380 --> 47:37.340\n and one unit of accountability\n\n47:37.340 --> 47:38.940\n or maybe zero units of accountability.\n\n47:38.940 --> 47:40.940\n Possibly, I mean, the anarchists tend to think like,\n\n47:40.940 --> 47:42.180\n no, everyone will be accountable.\n\n47:42.180 --> 47:44.100\n It's like, fuck they will.\n\n47:44.100 --> 47:46.700\n When have you seen this happen in real life?\n\n47:46.700 --> 47:47.740\n People aren't even accountable\n\n47:47.740 --> 47:49.580\n in their revolutions at the time.\n\n47:49.580 --> 47:54.580\n So you aren't looking at the way people really are.\n\n47:56.060 --> 47:58.700\n Marx is like, yeah, the people are like this,\n\n47:58.700 --> 47:59.540\n they're like that.\n\n47:59.540 --> 48:00.700\n Look at how capitalism does it.\n\n48:00.700 --> 48:03.780\n I mean, he of course assigns a lot of really\n\n48:03.780 --> 48:06.740\n ridiculous economic principles and practice,\n\n48:06.740 --> 48:09.420\n but and also assumes that everybody\n\n48:09.420 --> 48:13.060\n who makes any profit from anything is somehow stealing it\n\n48:13.060 --> 48:15.940\n and really assigns a negative moral aspect to them.\n\n48:15.940 --> 48:16.940\n And then it's like, oh yeah,\n\n48:16.940 --> 48:19.340\n but then eventually communism will happen.\n\n48:19.340 --> 48:20.580\n No one will act that way anymore.\n\n48:20.580 --> 48:21.740\n And you're like, whoa, hold on.\n\n48:21.740 --> 48:23.460\n You just said that people are all,\n\n48:23.460 --> 48:25.860\n are you saying it's all due to capitalism\n\n48:25.860 --> 48:27.860\n or is it innate?\n\n48:27.860 --> 48:31.620\n It's just, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of,\n\n48:31.620 --> 48:35.100\n and it's like, hey, look at you.\n\n48:35.100 --> 48:39.420\n You're like a notorious, like antisemitic, angry,\n\n48:39.420 --> 48:43.860\n like just absolute curmudgeon of a human being\n\n48:43.860 --> 48:46.740\n who seems to be really not all that fun to be around.\n\n48:46.740 --> 48:47.580\n Marx?\n\n48:47.580 --> 48:48.580\n Yeah, and then it's just like.\n\n48:48.580 --> 48:49.540\n So you have to think like,\n\n48:49.540 --> 48:52.740\n if there was 1 billion Marx's in the world,\n\n48:52.740 --> 48:53.700\n how would they behave?\n\n48:53.700 --> 48:54.700\n It would be absolute.\n\n48:56.020 --> 48:58.260\n They would hate each other so bad.\n\n48:58.260 --> 49:01.980\n And this isn't, for me to even poison them well on Marx\n\n49:01.980 --> 49:03.700\n is like, oh, his personality sucks.\n\n49:03.700 --> 49:05.700\n Like there's lots of people whose personality sucks.\n\n49:05.700 --> 49:07.300\n That doesn't mean they can't make,\n\n49:07.300 --> 49:09.780\n I don't know that it's never, what?\n\n49:09.780 --> 49:10.900\n You know what, somebody argues.\n\n49:10.900 --> 49:12.340\n He's just a loner.\n\n49:12.340 --> 49:14.940\n I mean, I don't know that his personality sucked at all.\n\n49:14.940 --> 49:17.580\n Let me walk that back and that he was human.\n\n49:17.580 --> 49:19.380\n Say his personality sucked.\n\n49:19.380 --> 49:23.140\n He was sometimes contradictory, irrational.\n\n49:23.140 --> 49:27.500\n Sometimes he was quite sexist\n\n49:27.500 --> 49:29.820\n despite the emails I've gotten.\n\n49:29.820 --> 49:34.820\n That told me that there's people who has written to me\n\n49:37.100 --> 49:40.660\n that Nietzsche has been unfairly labeled as sexist\n\n49:40.660 --> 49:43.340\n in his discussion about women.\n\n49:43.340 --> 49:45.780\n I'm pretty sure there's a bunch of documents\n\n49:45.780 --> 49:50.780\n where he's just like, he's just a bitter guy.\n\n49:51.300 --> 49:52.700\n I will agree with you.\n\n49:52.700 --> 49:54.620\n And Marx is as bitter as they come to,\n\n49:54.620 --> 49:58.780\n but bitterness in and of itself\n\n49:58.780 --> 50:03.020\n doesn't make, like why I hate Marxism\n\n50:03.020 --> 50:08.020\n comes from the entirety of the thing.\n\n50:08.140 --> 50:13.140\n But I'm not going to say that Marxism or practic...\n\n50:15.420 --> 50:18.740\n Man, you can find any forbidden book\n\n50:18.740 --> 50:20.660\n and it could have something good in it.\n\n50:20.660 --> 50:21.700\n As colonel is a good idea.\n\n50:21.700 --> 50:23.900\n Yeah, and like at the end of the day,\n\n50:23.900 --> 50:25.820\n Marx is a human being.\n\n50:25.820 --> 50:26.820\n He's got a nice beard.\n\n50:26.820 --> 50:28.500\n He does, he had a hell of a beard.\n\n50:28.500 --> 50:29.740\n Yeah, a decent portrait.\n\n50:29.740 --> 50:31.860\n I mean, he looks like the kind of guy like,\n\n50:31.860 --> 50:33.500\n I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley,\n\n50:33.500 --> 50:35.820\n but thankfully I don't think he was much of a fighter.\n\n50:35.820 --> 50:39.940\n But in any case, I mean, not the anarchists\n\n50:39.940 --> 50:44.860\n or they're more hot for like Max Stirner.\n\n50:44.860 --> 50:48.140\n People like to think that Nietzsche borrowed a lot\n\n50:48.140 --> 50:50.660\n from Stirner and my argument is one,\n\n50:50.660 --> 50:52.540\n you don't have any real evidence for that\n\n50:52.540 --> 50:54.740\n and two, bullshit, you know?\n\n50:54.740 --> 50:59.580\n I mean, anybody could, the fact that they have\n\n50:59.580 --> 51:03.980\n some overlapping thoughts doesn't make it lifted.\n\n51:03.980 --> 51:06.740\n Not to mention, go read a lot more philosophy\n\n51:06.740 --> 51:08.660\n and see how there's so many different things.\n\n51:08.660 --> 51:12.220\n Oh, this guy said it in 1722.\n\n51:12.220 --> 51:15.100\n Well, and then this guy says it again in 1922.\n\n51:15.100 --> 51:16.620\n Does that mean he read the other guy's stuff?\n\n51:16.620 --> 51:17.500\n Not necessarily.\n\n51:17.500 --> 51:19.260\n I mean, he's working from the same type\n\n51:19.260 --> 51:23.620\n of human physiological construct as anybody else.\n\n51:23.620 --> 51:25.260\n Like, of course it's possible\n\n51:25.260 --> 51:26.500\n that this guy could think the same thing.\n\n51:26.500 --> 51:29.380\n We think a lot of the same things, to be perfectly honest.\n\n51:29.380 --> 51:31.540\n I mean, reading the Hagakure,\n\n51:31.540 --> 51:33.380\n going back to philosophy books,\n\n51:33.380 --> 51:36.380\n this was really impactful on me as a younger adult\n\n51:36.380 --> 51:39.020\n because here's a book written in the 19th century\n\n51:39.020 --> 51:41.820\n about someone who lived through the 19th\n\n51:41.820 --> 51:45.460\n and 18th century at times as a samurai, now a monk,\n\n51:45.460 --> 51:48.980\n and his objections to society at the time,\n\n51:48.980 --> 51:51.980\n the same objections one was having to society\n\n51:51.980 --> 51:53.180\n as I was reading it.\n\n51:53.180 --> 51:55.500\n Like, the same human behaviors,\n\n51:55.500 --> 52:00.500\n the same impetus for action that he found a problem,\n\n52:03.620 --> 52:07.300\n like, well, that's the same shit now.\n\n52:07.300 --> 52:09.460\n Like, we're not, and this was the thing,\n\n52:09.460 --> 52:11.140\n and then I'm reading more religion,\n\n52:11.140 --> 52:13.140\n and I go, oh, we're no different\n\n52:13.140 --> 52:16.140\n than anyone who wrote the Torah or older.\n\n52:16.140 --> 52:18.740\n We are the same thing with the same problems,\n\n52:18.740 --> 52:21.420\n with the same psychological issues,\n\n52:21.420 --> 52:22.660\n the same human behaviors.\n\n52:22.660 --> 52:24.940\n Like, these things are not different,\n\n52:24.940 --> 52:26.020\n and we haven't changed.\n\n52:26.020 --> 52:29.140\n Growing set of tools, though, to kill each other with\n\n52:29.140 --> 52:31.220\n or to communicate together and all that kind of stuff,\n\n52:31.220 --> 52:33.700\n but underlying it, there's a human nature.\n\n52:33.700 --> 52:35.580\n Well, we're also trying to understand that human nature.\n\n52:35.580 --> 52:37.420\n I think we've, just like you said,\n\n52:37.420 --> 52:38.420\n learning how to fish,\n\n52:38.420 --> 52:41.940\n acquired more and more knowledge about that human nature,\n\n52:41.940 --> 52:44.300\n but it's been a very slow journey,\n\n52:44.300 --> 52:46.740\n slower than people realize\n\n52:46.740 --> 52:49.020\n in terms of understanding human nature.\n\n52:49.020 --> 52:51.100\n Let me ask, in terms of egoism,\n\n52:51.100 --> 52:56.100\n to be curious, to get your sense about Ayn Rand\n\n52:56.700 --> 53:01.700\n and her whole idea of virtue of selfishness and her,\n\n53:01.820 --> 53:06.500\n because you mentioned that everybody has a kernel of truth.\n\n53:06.500 --> 53:08.860\n There's potential for a kernel of truth\n\n53:08.860 --> 53:10.620\n to be discovered in anything.\n\n53:10.620 --> 53:14.420\n For example, I've been recently reading Mein Kampf.\n\n53:16.180 --> 53:18.220\n You know what, that's the thing.\n\n53:18.220 --> 53:22.020\n Even, there's something in, there's probably things\n\n53:22.020 --> 53:25.820\n in Mein Kampf that are not the surface level read.\n\n53:25.820 --> 53:27.980\n If you get all hung up on all,\n\n53:27.980 --> 53:32.860\n probably all his crap about his anger at Jews\n\n53:32.860 --> 53:34.220\n and this and that, all this crap,\n\n53:34.220 --> 53:36.860\n it's like, okay, yeah, that's right on the surface.\n\n53:37.780 --> 53:38.820\n Try to get below that.\n\n53:38.820 --> 53:43.820\n Try to see, how is he creating the Jews as a cope somehow?\n\n53:43.820 --> 53:46.820\n Like, how is he using, why are they his scapegoat,\n\n53:46.820 --> 53:49.180\n and I mean scapegoat in the,\n\n53:49.180 --> 53:51.980\n so Ren\u00e9 Girard's concept of the scapegoat,\n\n53:51.980 --> 53:55.580\n I mean it in that sense, whereas Hitler uses,\n\n53:55.580 --> 54:00.300\n he wants to make the Jews the scapegoat for World War I.\n\n54:00.300 --> 54:01.140\n You know what I mean?\n\n54:01.140 --> 54:03.980\n For me, the starting point, similar with Ayn Rand,\n\n54:03.980 --> 54:08.180\n is that Mein Kampf is not a good place to search,\n\n54:08.180 --> 54:09.780\n not just because Hitler is evil,\n\n54:09.780 --> 54:11.820\n but it's just not full of ideas.\n\n54:11.820 --> 54:13.460\n No, it is not.\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:16.220\n It has its significance due to a lot of things.\n\n54:16.220 --> 54:17.820\n Historically speaking.\n\n54:17.820 --> 54:19.820\n The starting point for me with Hitler\n\n54:19.820 --> 54:23.180\n is to acknowledge that he is human\n\n54:23.180 --> 54:26.060\n and to at least consider the possibility\n\n54:26.060 --> 54:28.340\n that any one of us could have been Hitler.\n\n54:28.340 --> 54:29.180\n So like, not to make it.\n\n54:29.180 --> 54:31.540\n Well, that's a Peterson kind of concept.\n\n54:31.540 --> 54:33.700\n Also, Jonathan Haidt has a thing\n\n54:33.700 --> 54:38.500\n about the difference between hate and disgust mechanisms\n\n54:38.500 --> 54:41.900\n and things like that, and so he goes into the,\n\n54:41.900 --> 54:45.580\n looking at Hitler through his diary entries\n\n54:45.580 --> 54:46.620\n and journals and stuff like that\n\n54:46.620 --> 54:50.180\n to look and see it more as the disgust mechanism\n\n54:50.180 --> 54:52.540\n than also trying to see if there's any\n\n54:52.540 --> 54:56.740\n evolutionary biological attachment to this, whatever.\n\n54:56.740 --> 54:59.380\n I mean, you're right, he is a human being.\n\n54:59.380 --> 55:02.180\n Any of us, we're all human beings.\n\n55:02.180 --> 55:07.180\n It's not that, it's probably jarring for people to think,\n\n55:07.820 --> 55:12.820\n but we're all, I guess, supposedly potentially capable\n\n55:12.820 --> 55:17.140\n of just being in, and all these evil people in the world\n\n55:17.140 --> 55:20.620\n think they're doing it for the sake of good,\n\n55:20.620 --> 55:22.820\n which makes them the most dangerous.\n\n55:22.820 --> 55:26.580\n And there's some, there's differences in levels of insane.\n\n55:26.580 --> 55:29.340\n I think Hitler was way more insane than Stalin.\n\n55:29.340 --> 55:33.780\n I think Stalin legitimately thought he was doing good.\n\n55:33.780 --> 55:36.100\n I would say that's probably true.\n\n55:36.100 --> 55:40.420\n Stalin was just outright brutal.\n\n55:40.420 --> 55:44.020\n Like he had his five year plan, he had all those other things.\n\n55:44.020 --> 55:47.180\n He just had a much lower value for human life,\n\n55:47.180 --> 55:49.820\n and so he was willing to take, make decisions\n\n55:49.820 --> 55:53.900\n about what he actually, as a good executive,\n\n55:54.780 --> 55:59.420\n which he was, of managing different bureaucracies and so on,\n\n55:59.420 --> 56:01.100\n he was willing to make decisions\n\n56:01.100 --> 56:04.620\n that resulted in mass human suffering,\n\n56:04.620 --> 56:09.620\n where Hitler was, it seems like to me, much moodier.\n\n56:09.620 --> 56:12.620\n So allowed emotions and moods to make decisions.\n\n56:12.620 --> 56:16.660\n I think we also have to consider the different trajectories\n\n56:16.660 --> 56:19.340\n and how, where, and when they were making their decisions.\n\n56:19.340 --> 56:21.300\n And I mean, not by time specifically,\n\n56:21.300 --> 56:24.260\n but Hitler engaged into this conflict\n\n56:24.260 --> 56:27.140\n across multiple continents.\n\n56:27.140 --> 56:29.980\n And then that, everything that comes\n\n56:29.980 --> 56:32.460\n with basically fighting the whole world,\n\n56:33.740 --> 56:36.380\n Stalin had his conflict,\n\n56:36.380 --> 56:41.380\n and then he really mostly compartmentalized the rest of it.\n\n56:41.460 --> 56:43.500\n So he was dealing with his own internal\n\n56:43.500 --> 56:46.220\n instead of dealing with the internal and the external.\n\n56:46.220 --> 56:48.780\n So if Stalin was put under a World War scenario,\n\n56:48.780 --> 56:49.980\n I don't know, maybe he would have\n\n56:49.980 --> 56:51.940\n eventually lost his marbles too.\n\n56:51.940 --> 56:54.820\n Yeah, I'm not sure that that's, you're right.\n\n56:54.820 --> 56:58.460\n The hunger for power was more internalized for Stalin.\n\n56:58.460 --> 57:00.940\n He wanted to control the land that already existed\n\n57:00.940 --> 57:02.940\n as opposed to wanting to colonize other land.\n\n57:02.940 --> 57:05.580\n He was as nationalistic as Hitler,\n\n57:05.580 --> 57:10.380\n but, and was as capable and willing\n\n57:10.380 --> 57:13.260\n for violent conflict as Hitler,\n\n57:13.260 --> 57:15.900\n for the aims of the state.\n\n57:17.540 --> 57:22.540\n But he centered and internalized\n\n57:22.740 --> 57:26.700\n prior to then externalizing and moving outwards.\n\n57:26.700 --> 57:28.700\n Whereas even maybe prior to him,\n\n57:28.700 --> 57:31.700\n there was an interest to continually push communism\n\n57:31.700 --> 57:34.180\n in an aggressive sense following on the momentum\n\n57:34.180 --> 57:37.740\n from the 1918 revolution.\n\n57:37.740 --> 57:42.740\n And that, the halting of that through various aspects,\n\n57:43.860 --> 57:47.500\n I guess in Germany, part of that was the National Socialists.\n\n57:47.500 --> 57:49.980\n Like they came up and then they were the other ones\n\n57:49.980 --> 57:50.900\n to fight the communists,\n\n57:50.900 --> 57:54.060\n and so you had the two totalitarians going after it.\n\n57:54.060 --> 57:55.740\n But then in the rest of the world\n\n57:55.740 --> 58:00.860\n that was not dealing with totalitarian aspects,\n\n58:00.860 --> 58:02.740\n it was just, it wasn't gonna stick,\n\n58:02.740 --> 58:04.660\n especially in the West and other places.\n\n58:04.660 --> 58:09.020\n But Stalin, just casually thinking,\n\n58:09.020 --> 58:11.300\n it seemed like Stalin decided to go,\n\n58:11.300 --> 58:12.620\n all right, well, we're not gonna go\n\n58:12.620 --> 58:14.940\n just start launching right into more conflicts here.\n\n58:14.940 --> 58:17.180\n We're gonna, these dudes are going down,\n\n58:17.180 --> 58:18.620\n so that's cool for us,\n\n58:18.620 --> 58:20.580\n because they hate us and we hate them.\n\n58:22.180 --> 58:24.780\n But now we're gonna focus internally,\n\n58:24.780 --> 58:28.020\n and then we're gonna work on growing at a slower rate\n\n58:28.020 --> 58:30.180\n and picking our battles a bit more specifically.\n\n58:30.180 --> 58:32.860\n And of course there's, you can get to the,\n\n58:32.860 --> 58:34.100\n even this is after Stalin,\n\n58:34.100 --> 58:36.340\n but you got the Bezmenov type stuff\n\n58:36.340 --> 58:40.620\n talking about subversion in cultural aspects.\n\n58:40.620 --> 58:42.700\n Yeah, I mean, there's this fascinating dynamics\n\n58:42.700 --> 58:45.100\n to propaganda throughout the whole period that's.\n\n58:45.100 --> 58:47.020\n Yeah, it's a whole nother kernel, yeah.\n\n58:47.020 --> 58:49.820\n Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?\n\n58:49.820 --> 58:53.540\n One of the things that's kind of fascinating to look at\n\n58:53.540 --> 58:57.860\n is how many nations, both journalists and nations,\n\n58:57.860 --> 59:00.940\n wanted, almost craved to take Hitler at his word\n\n59:00.940 --> 59:04.300\n that he wanted peace until it was too late.\n\n59:04.300 --> 59:08.380\n They almost wanted to delude themselves.\n\n59:08.380 --> 59:11.620\n I mean, the same is true with the Stalin,\n\n59:11.620 --> 59:13.540\n people wanted to take Stalin at his word for.\n\n59:13.540 --> 59:14.860\n Oh, they still delude themselves.\n\n59:14.860 --> 59:15.700\n Yeah.\n\n59:15.700 --> 59:19.740\n We will delude ourselves over any number of things\n\n59:19.740 --> 59:22.540\n until even after the fact where the history just says,\n\n59:22.540 --> 59:24.940\n hey, fuck face, you know?\n\n59:24.940 --> 59:27.420\n You cannot supplement your pseudo reality\n\n59:27.420 --> 59:30.220\n onto actual reality here.\n\n59:30.220 --> 59:34.460\n But yet, we deal with people in pseudo realities constantly.\n\n59:34.460 --> 59:36.700\n I mean, we will always find a way\n\n59:36.700 --> 59:39.980\n to change reality to suit our needs.\n\n59:39.980 --> 59:41.180\n Well, the nature of truth now,\n\n59:41.180 --> 59:42.860\n there's now multiple actual truths.\n\n59:42.860 --> 59:43.980\n It's kind of fascinating.\n\n59:43.980 --> 59:46.580\n There's multiple versions of history\n\n59:46.580 --> 59:47.980\n that people are telling.\n\n59:47.980 --> 59:52.820\n You know, the version of the Great Patriotic War in Russia,\n\n59:52.820 --> 59:55.740\n the World War II in Russia is very different today\n\n59:55.740 --> 59:57.540\n under Putin than the version\n\n59:57.540 --> 1:00:00.820\n that we're learning in the United States\n\n1:00:00.820 --> 1:00:02.540\n and then different than the version in Europe.\n\n1:00:02.540 --> 1:00:06.220\n In the United States, the hero of the war\n\n1:00:06.220 --> 1:00:07.500\n is the United States.\n\n1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:11.580\n In Europe, there's a much more sad and solemn story\n\n1:00:11.580 --> 1:00:12.740\n of suffering and so on.\n\n1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:13.580\n Sure.\n\n1:00:13.580 --> 1:00:15.300\n In Russia, it's the Great.\n\n1:00:15.300 --> 1:00:16.220\n Patriotic War.\n\n1:00:16.220 --> 1:00:17.060\n Yes.\n\n1:00:17.060 --> 1:00:19.100\n It was a unifier of a sense.\n\n1:00:19.100 --> 1:00:23.900\n And it, I mean, yeah, I mean,\n\n1:00:23.900 --> 1:00:28.020\n you can't argue that war and conflict that,\n\n1:00:28.020 --> 1:00:32.020\n and or just even reducing that to stressors,\n\n1:00:32.020 --> 1:00:36.260\n agitation, suffering doesn't create human motivation.\n\n1:00:36.260 --> 1:00:37.220\n You know, we started this off.\n\n1:00:37.220 --> 1:00:38.580\n You brought up a Frankel.\n\n1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:40.340\n I'm like, yeah, Frankel's dope.\n\n1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:41.860\n Man, it serves for meaning.\n\n1:00:41.860 --> 1:00:43.220\n Maslow's great.\n\n1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:46.940\n And I talked to you about how I started to think like,\n\n1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:51.940\n man, do the ability for human beings to live\n\n1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:54.700\n and or potentially flourish\n\n1:00:54.700 --> 1:00:57.620\n in the worst environments you can think of\n\n1:00:57.620 --> 1:00:59.980\n is pretty incredible in and of itself.\n\n1:00:59.980 --> 1:01:04.140\n And that it's a crazy thought to think that\n\n1:01:04.140 --> 1:01:09.140\n without Frankel and Maslow ending up in concentration camps,\n\n1:01:10.140 --> 1:01:13.900\n do they write some of the most important books\n\n1:01:13.900 --> 1:01:16.260\n on philosophy in the 20th century?\n\n1:01:16.260 --> 1:01:20.060\n And that's insane on a lot of different levels.\n\n1:01:20.060 --> 1:01:22.500\n But, yeah, suffering is a creative force.\n\n1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:25.220\n I mean, I don't, do you think we'll always have war?\n\n1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:28.900\n Yes, we will always have war in some form or another.\n\n1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:32.700\n We need, quote unquote, air quotes,\n\n1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:36.100\n for those just listening, war to survive.\n\n1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:37.380\n We need war to flourish.\n\n1:01:37.380 --> 1:01:38.260\n We need at least.\n\n1:01:38.260 --> 1:01:40.500\n Can you explain the quote, the air quotes around the war?\n\n1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:45.020\n Well, because take, take, take, take the.\n\n1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:46.340\n You see wars as violence?\n\n1:01:46.340 --> 1:01:47.660\n No, wars are not violence.\n\n1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:48.500\n So like, so when we're talking.\n\n1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:52.100\n No, air quotes because while us getting on the mat\n\n1:01:52.100 --> 1:01:53.660\n or just getting on these hardwood floors\n\n1:01:53.660 --> 1:01:57.020\n and wrestling around is not literal war,\n\n1:01:57.020 --> 1:01:58.580\n it's war of a sorts.\n\n1:01:59.740 --> 1:02:01.940\n It is a diluted form of war.\n\n1:02:01.940 --> 1:02:03.900\n American football is a diluted form of war.\n\n1:02:03.900 --> 1:02:05.860\n All this, these are diluted forms of war.\n\n1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:07.840\n Tennis is a diluted form of war.\n\n1:02:09.420 --> 1:02:12.980\n And I think one of the best explanations I ever got\n\n1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:16.580\n from this, and another person very impactful\n\n1:02:16.580 --> 1:02:19.660\n on my life and outlook and thinking about things,\n\n1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:20.580\n Cormac McCarthy.\n\n1:02:20.580 --> 1:02:24.460\n And so in Blood Meridian, there's this fantastic speech\n\n1:02:24.460 --> 1:02:26.740\n about war given by the judge,\n\n1:02:26.740 --> 1:02:28.860\n which there's a ton of fantastic speeches\n\n1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:31.100\n on things given by the judge, yeah.\n\n1:02:31.100 --> 1:02:33.060\n All that exists in creation without my knowledge\n\n1:02:33.060 --> 1:02:34.700\n does so without my consent.\n\n1:02:34.700 --> 1:02:36.780\n Okay, that's pretty heavy.\n\n1:02:36.780 --> 1:02:38.140\n That's, that's hard.\n\n1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:39.140\n Go ahead, can you break that up?\n\n1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:40.260\n Can you say that again?\n\n1:02:40.260 --> 1:02:43.540\n All things that exist in creation,\n\n1:02:43.540 --> 1:02:45.280\n all things that exist without my knowledge\n\n1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:46.820\n do so without my consent.\n\n1:02:49.260 --> 1:02:50.460\n What does that mean?\n\n1:02:50.460 --> 1:02:53.600\n Well, I think from the judge's perspective,\n\n1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:56.460\n it's like, well, I didn't consent to that bird\n\n1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:59.800\n or that dog or this building or all this,\n\n1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:02.140\n like all of this, you know, I didn't create it,\n\n1:03:02.140 --> 1:03:03.860\n so it's done so without my consent.\n\n1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:05.740\n And if it's up to my consent,\n\n1:03:05.740 --> 1:03:08.060\n well, I'll design it how I want to.\n\n1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:11.020\n There's another similar look into how the judge is\n\n1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:16.020\n in that book is he would study everything\n\n1:03:16.060 --> 1:03:17.460\n everywhere he went.\n\n1:03:17.460 --> 1:03:21.020\n And so he's collected this group of nary do wells\n\n1:03:21.020 --> 1:03:24.140\n from all over to go on these hunts\n\n1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:28.820\n against certain tribes in the Southwest\n\n1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:31.300\n and getting paid by the US government,\n\n1:03:31.300 --> 1:03:32.860\n the Mexican government.\n\n1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:36.500\n So he's on these Indian hunts\n\n1:03:36.500 --> 1:03:39.660\n and yet they're going to all these different places\n\n1:03:39.660 --> 1:03:43.860\n and they would stay the night in a cave somewhere\n\n1:03:43.860 --> 1:03:44.940\n and he would find cave paintings,\n\n1:03:44.940 --> 1:03:46.200\n he would write them all down,\n\n1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:47.820\n or he would find old pieces.\n\n1:03:47.820 --> 1:03:50.980\n There's an example of him, the narrator,\n\n1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:53.940\n explaining how watching the judge and how he drawing,\n\n1:03:53.940 --> 1:03:56.660\n I mean, he's got this notebook just full of things,\n\n1:03:56.660 --> 1:03:58.900\n drawings and writings,\n\n1:03:58.900 --> 1:04:02.140\n and how he found like a piece of armor\n\n1:04:02.140 --> 1:04:04.220\n from a conquistador or something way back in the day,\n\n1:04:04.220 --> 1:04:06.500\n Spanish armor, and he draws it into his book\n\n1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:07.780\n and then crushes it.\n\n1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:12.620\n And so the reason we'll always have war\n\n1:04:12.620 --> 1:04:15.420\n in this society is because there's this struggle\n\n1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:18.540\n amongst people that want to be the designers.\n\n1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:21.300\n There's that, but I'm just saying\n\n1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:23.700\n that he's got this whole quote on war,\n\n1:04:23.700 --> 1:04:27.700\n like war is play, war is a game,\n\n1:04:27.700 --> 1:04:30.620\n and the difference is is that what's at stake.\n\n1:04:30.620 --> 1:04:33.900\n So all things are a game of some sort\n\n1:04:33.900 --> 1:04:35.460\n and you're putting up for it\n\n1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:36.860\n or what you're willing to put up for it\n\n1:04:36.860 --> 1:04:40.160\n determines whether or not you're going to participate or not.\n\n1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:45.160\n And all aspects of any game is war\n\n1:04:45.660 --> 1:04:48.220\n and it's just, what is at stake?\n\n1:04:48.220 --> 1:04:49.940\n If it's your life, it's a different story.\n\n1:04:49.940 --> 1:04:52.340\n If it's just a coin, it's another thing.\n\n1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:56.380\n A nice way to put it is if humans play a game\n\n1:04:56.380 --> 1:05:00.500\n in this kind of pursuit of creating,\n\n1:05:01.380 --> 1:05:02.860\n whatever the hell the reason is\n\n1:05:02.860 --> 1:05:07.300\n that we keep creating cooler and cooler things,\n\n1:05:07.300 --> 1:05:08.980\n it seems to be the result of a game\n\n1:05:08.980 --> 1:05:11.460\n that we naturally play, we naturally crave.\n\n1:05:11.460 --> 1:05:14.660\n I don't know, I mean, that's been the struggle of philosophy\n\n1:05:14.660 --> 1:05:17.580\n is to understand what is the underlying force of all that.\n\n1:05:17.580 --> 1:05:19.580\n Is it the will to power?\n\n1:05:19.580 --> 1:05:21.500\n I think will to power is a really great way\n\n1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:23.500\n of describing it.\n\n1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:25.620\n Do you want to be the winner of the game?\n\n1:05:25.620 --> 1:05:27.660\n No, not just, no, I don't look at will to power\n\n1:05:27.660 --> 1:05:29.300\n as being the winner of the game.\n\n1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:31.680\n Well, I mean, if we're going to get philosophical,\n\n1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:33.340\n yes, you want to be the winner of the game.\n\n1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:36.260\n What does winning the game define how you win?\n\n1:05:36.260 --> 1:05:38.540\n Everybody's going to define that win differently.\n\n1:05:38.540 --> 1:05:40.740\n You could define the win in the most base level\n\n1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:42.400\n like, oh, I got all the things.\n\n1:05:44.020 --> 1:05:45.120\n Well, if you got all those things\n\n1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:48.680\n without the needing component of fulfillment,\n\n1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:50.460\n then you're going to be a very unhappy person\n\n1:05:50.460 --> 1:05:51.300\n with a whole lot of things.\n\n1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:54.860\n But there's a self referential aspect to where, to me,\n\n1:05:54.860 --> 1:05:56.660\n the winner of the game is defined\n\n1:05:56.660 --> 1:05:58.580\n by the people playing the game.\n\n1:05:58.580 --> 1:06:03.580\n So if I'm playing a game, I want to win in the sense\n\n1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:06.940\n that most of the other people who are playing the game\n\n1:06:06.940 --> 1:06:08.860\n will say, yeah, that guy won.\n\n1:06:08.860 --> 1:06:12.260\n By our collective definition, if I just come up,\n\n1:06:12.260 --> 1:06:14.580\n listen, I'm sort of, if I come up with my own.\n\n1:06:14.580 --> 1:06:17.540\n That's a lot of weight on the external on you.\n\n1:06:17.540 --> 1:06:21.100\n Right, but that's how games seem to work.\n\n1:06:21.100 --> 1:06:21.940\n Somewhat.\n\n1:06:21.940 --> 1:06:24.260\n So I'm already a winner in my life\n\n1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:26.300\n by defining my own definition of success.\n\n1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:31.300\n I'm basically the best person in the world at doing me.\n\n1:06:32.060 --> 1:06:32.900\n At being Lex.\n\n1:06:32.900 --> 1:06:35.700\n Yeah, so like, and I'm really happy with that.\n\n1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:37.140\n That's a source of happiness.\n\n1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:38.380\n Well, I mean, think about it.\n\n1:06:38.380 --> 1:06:40.440\n Games are also iterated, right?\n\n1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:42.820\n So you start off with your game\n\n1:06:42.820 --> 1:06:45.460\n and then your game with your immediates\n\n1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:46.980\n and then the game further than that\n\n1:06:46.980 --> 1:06:47.940\n and the game further than that\n\n1:06:47.940 --> 1:06:49.940\n and then the game today and the game tomorrow\n\n1:06:49.940 --> 1:06:50.900\n and the game next week.\n\n1:06:50.900 --> 1:06:52.480\n And so it never ends.\n\n1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:54.980\n And if you try to keep thinking about it that way,\n\n1:06:54.980 --> 1:06:56.160\n no wonder people go crazy.\n\n1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:59.060\n But we don't want to think about things that way.\n\n1:06:59.060 --> 1:07:01.500\n We don't want to think about being towards death.\n\n1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:04.820\n We don't want to think about whether or not\n\n1:07:04.820 --> 1:07:06.420\n I'm going anywhere after this\n\n1:07:06.420 --> 1:07:08.100\n other than in the ground or what have you.\n\n1:07:08.100 --> 1:07:09.940\n Like, you know.\n\n1:07:09.940 --> 1:07:12.020\n All of these games are a sense of some distraction.\n\n1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:12.860\n This is where we brought up.\n\n1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:15.780\n Kind of, but I mean, it's violence is that\n\n1:07:15.780 --> 1:07:18.580\n we need to let this out.\n\n1:07:18.580 --> 1:07:23.160\n And so it is of our, kids need to wrestle and play\n\n1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:25.160\n just like animals need to wrestle and play.\n\n1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:27.460\n We need to have forms of competition.\n\n1:07:27.460 --> 1:07:29.820\n We need to have ways to test ourselves,\n\n1:07:29.820 --> 1:07:34.180\n to create when, what is it?\n\n1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:36.860\n When at peace a man of war makes war with himself.\n\n1:07:36.860 --> 1:07:39.720\n And so we need to be able to competently\n\n1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:42.380\n go at war with ourselves and go at war with our neighbor\n\n1:07:42.380 --> 1:07:44.380\n and go at war with our neighbor's neighbor\n\n1:07:44.380 --> 1:07:47.740\n in a way that is repeatable at the very least.\n\n1:07:47.740 --> 1:07:50.620\n So one way of saying that there will always be war,\n\n1:07:50.620 --> 1:07:54.060\n I mean, that's my hopeful view\n\n1:07:54.060 --> 1:07:56.740\n is that most of the war conducted in the future\n\n1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:57.900\n will be, like you said,\n\n1:07:57.900 --> 1:08:00.460\n the man must go to war with himself.\n\n1:08:00.460 --> 1:08:01.820\n That would be great.\n\n1:08:01.820 --> 1:08:04.620\n That's what to me love is,\n\n1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:07.780\n is like focusing on yourself and your own improvement\n\n1:08:07.780 --> 1:08:12.100\n and your own creativity and towards others feeling,\n\n1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:15.820\n sort of emphasizing cooperative behavior\n\n1:08:15.820 --> 1:08:19.420\n and compassion and empathy.\n\n1:08:19.420 --> 1:08:20.240\n It would be great.\n\n1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:23.820\n But I mean, you can have, well, I'll put it to you this way.\n\n1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:28.820\n If you have a whole community of Randians\n\n1:08:29.660 --> 1:08:32.660\n and a whole community of Ancoms,\n\n1:08:32.660 --> 1:08:37.540\n and they could all like, I don't know,\n\n1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:39.620\n toast of London on Netflix,\n\n1:08:39.620 --> 1:08:41.900\n and they love Netflix and they love the internet\n\n1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:46.860\n and they love picking apart Mon Comp with you.\n\n1:08:46.860 --> 1:08:49.020\n They love like, they like all these things,\n\n1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:52.420\n even the esoteric that they can get on with.\n\n1:08:52.420 --> 1:08:55.660\n But at the fundamental root,\n\n1:08:55.660 --> 1:08:57.700\n they cannot help but go to war\n\n1:08:57.700 --> 1:08:59.940\n because they are literally oil and water.\n\n1:08:59.940 --> 1:09:01.540\n No, but see, but they would,\n\n1:09:01.540 --> 1:09:05.740\n the very labels they assign to themselves\n\n1:09:05.740 --> 1:09:07.500\n would need to dissipate.\n\n1:09:07.500 --> 1:09:08.340\n Well, this is true.\n\n1:09:08.340 --> 1:09:09.740\n Well, then you would have to stop being\n\n1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:11.100\n whatever it is that you took on\n\n1:09:11.100 --> 1:09:14.740\n as your ideological or religious point, right?\n\n1:09:14.740 --> 1:09:18.260\n Yeah, I mean, there's some days I'm Ancom,\n\n1:09:18.260 --> 1:09:23.260\n some days I'm Ancaps and whatever the anarchic capital.\n\n1:09:24.980 --> 1:09:28.260\n I mean, it depends on the hour, the minute of the day,\n\n1:09:28.260 --> 1:09:31.220\n you constantly changing moods and embracing that flow,\n\n1:09:31.220 --> 1:09:34.380\n the change of opinions, of ideas.\n\n1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:35.580\n As there's some days like,\n\n1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:37.300\n I'm actually cognizant of the fact\n\n1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:39.180\n because I've been not getting my sleep.\n\n1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:41.460\n And after I get some sleep,\n\n1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:44.260\n I see I'm so much more optimistic about the world.\n\n1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:46.220\n The less and less sleep I get,\n\n1:09:46.220 --> 1:09:48.020\n the more sad and cynical I get.\n\n1:09:48.020 --> 1:09:48.860\n I can see that.\n\n1:09:48.860 --> 1:09:50.340\n There's an up and down constantly.\n\n1:09:50.340 --> 1:09:52.820\n I don't even let my, well, okay.\n\n1:09:52.820 --> 1:09:54.180\n I try not to let.\n\n1:09:54.180 --> 1:09:56.340\n And most days it's never a problem.\n\n1:09:56.340 --> 1:10:00.340\n Any sort of like, what the kids call it now,\n\n1:10:00.340 --> 1:10:02.140\n blackpilled way of thinking,\n\n1:10:02.140 --> 1:10:07.140\n be my over, the umbrella which I hang under.\n\n1:10:07.380 --> 1:10:10.900\n So we actually, to drag us back,\n\n1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:14.580\n can we talk about Carl Gotch and Cat Tressley?\n\n1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:18.460\n Because I do want to make sure I touch it.\n\n1:10:18.460 --> 1:10:20.380\n I mean, what, who were?\n\n1:10:20.380 --> 1:10:22.100\n Carl Gotch is.\n\n1:10:22.100 --> 1:10:23.620\n Is he the greatest catch wrestler?\n\n1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:26.820\n I don't know if he was the greatest catch wrestler ever.\n\n1:10:26.820 --> 1:10:30.860\n I don't, I mean, he's one of them for a myriad of,\n\n1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:34.100\n Carl Gotch, Billy Robinson.\n\n1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:38.060\n Gotch and Robinson's trainer, Billy Riley.\n\n1:10:40.020 --> 1:10:41.860\n So who are these figures and what did they bring to you?\n\n1:10:41.860 --> 1:10:44.620\n Joe Maeda, he's one of the greatest catch wrestlers ever\n\n1:10:44.620 --> 1:10:47.020\n because he's responsible for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\n\n1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:48.620\n Along with Cristal Gracie.\n\n1:10:48.620 --> 1:10:51.900\n Okay, there's so much of things I'd like to say here,\n\n1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:54.140\n but one of the things that catch wrestling\n\n1:10:54.140 --> 1:10:57.900\n seemed to espouse as a principle is that of violence.\n\n1:10:57.900 --> 1:11:01.940\n I just, the tournaments I competed at,\n\n1:11:01.940 --> 1:11:03.260\n the unfortunate thing,\n\n1:11:03.260 --> 1:11:06.260\n and we'll probably hopefully talk about it a little bit.\n\n1:11:06.260 --> 1:11:09.260\n They were disorganized and the level of competition\n\n1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:11.140\n was pretty low where people really sucked.\n\n1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:12.740\n Pretty typical.\n\n1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:13.740\n Is that typical, okay.\n\n1:11:13.740 --> 1:11:18.740\n Well, it's, I mean, think about local run of the mill\n\n1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:22.660\n Jiu Jitsu tournament versus IBJJF created,\n\n1:11:22.660 --> 1:11:24.660\n you know, a vast difference, so.\n\n1:11:24.660 --> 1:11:28.780\n So I, you know, but there is, to me as a human being,\n\n1:11:30.140 --> 1:11:31.860\n like intellectually, philosophically,\n\n1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:34.300\n it was more interesting to go to catch wrestling tournament.\n\n1:11:34.300 --> 1:11:36.940\n It seemed more real and honest\n\n1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:39.900\n because of the way they communicate about violence\n\n1:11:39.900 --> 1:11:40.740\n and aggression. I love that.\n\n1:11:40.740 --> 1:11:44.140\n So it is often more honest.\n\n1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:44.980\n I think that as.\n\n1:11:44.980 --> 1:11:45.820\n Who is that from?\n\n1:11:45.820 --> 1:11:48.060\n Does that originate from, gosh, is that really Rob said?\n\n1:11:48.060 --> 1:11:50.140\n Well, I mean, it originates from all wrestling\n\n1:11:50.140 --> 1:11:52.620\n in that even Wade Chalice,\n\n1:11:52.620 --> 1:11:57.620\n not a classically considered catch wrestler,\n\n1:11:59.700 --> 1:12:02.620\n yet the reason why he has the world record\n\n1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:05.260\n for most amount of world champions pinned\n\n1:12:05.260 --> 1:12:09.420\n or the record for pins in the NCAA is because,\n\n1:12:09.420 --> 1:12:11.700\n well, of course the idea is to put you on your back\n\n1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:15.340\n and pin you, but there's no way you're gonna let me do that.\n\n1:12:15.340 --> 1:12:20.060\n So how do I make it so that you want me to pin you?\n\n1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:22.980\n Well, it's by you put them in excruciating pain.\n\n1:12:22.980 --> 1:12:27.340\n So at the end of the day, you're both there.\n\n1:12:27.340 --> 1:12:28.780\n You both wanna win.\n\n1:12:28.780 --> 1:12:31.860\n Neither one wants to allow anything to the other.\n\n1:12:31.860 --> 1:12:36.500\n So how do I get you to lose to me?\n\n1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.220\n Well, I make it so unbearable for you\n\n1:12:38.220 --> 1:12:40.220\n that you decide losing is better than staying.\n\n1:12:40.220 --> 1:12:42.460\n So those two are so fascinating\n\n1:12:42.460 --> 1:12:44.660\n because so coming from Russia,\n\n1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:46.540\n I don't know if that's where I got it\n\n1:12:46.540 --> 1:12:49.580\n or if it's just my own predisposition\n\n1:12:49.580 --> 1:12:51.060\n is I always loved the,\n\n1:12:52.260 --> 1:12:55.660\n there's two ways to get you to want to pin yourself.\n\n1:12:55.660 --> 1:12:59.140\n One is to making it so painful not to pin yourself\n\n1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:00.980\n that you pin yourself or whatever.\n\n1:13:00.980 --> 1:13:03.940\n And the other is, it's sort of like a Bruce Lee,\n\n1:13:03.940 --> 1:13:07.500\n water flows, make it so easy to pin yourself.\n\n1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:09.980\n So it's technique, it's like the elegance,\n\n1:13:09.980 --> 1:13:11.060\n the ease of movement.\n\n1:13:11.060 --> 1:13:14.700\n This is the Satya brothers, Vasya, Satya,\n\n1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:19.100\n like the, just the elegance, the efficiency.\n\n1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:20.940\n Yeah, they're practically like ballet watching those guys.\n\n1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:21.780\n You know, it's incredible.\n\n1:13:21.780 --> 1:13:23.300\n Satya brothers are massive.\n\n1:13:23.300 --> 1:13:27.980\n And I'll also caveat a little bit that like,\n\n1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:31.900\n if you're approaching this from a Russian perspective,\n\n1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:36.580\n Russians are quite truthful about things,\n\n1:13:36.580 --> 1:13:38.420\n especially when it comes to something like combat.\n\n1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:40.780\n They just, this is how it is.\n\n1:13:40.780 --> 1:13:42.220\n And this is how it's going to be.\n\n1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:43.420\n It's honest. Yes.\n\n1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:46.620\n And honesty is what I really like about catch wrestling\n\n1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:49.820\n because I find that we, given any opportunity\n\n1:13:49.820 --> 1:13:52.500\n for us to be dishonest for any number of reasons,\n\n1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:56.020\n we're gonna, especially if it's a dishonesty\n\n1:13:56.020 --> 1:13:57.500\n towards a positive, right?\n\n1:13:57.500 --> 1:13:59.340\n Like, oh, well, you know, it's all technique\n\n1:13:59.340 --> 1:14:02.460\n and it's all this and it's the gentle art and blah.\n\n1:14:02.460 --> 1:14:06.740\n Bro, I have rolled with ADCC world champions,\n\n1:14:06.740 --> 1:14:09.100\n you know, some of the best you have ever heard of.\n\n1:14:09.100 --> 1:14:12.100\n There ain't a lot of gentleness when it comes to like,\n\n1:14:12.100 --> 1:14:15.220\n oh yeah, they wanted to sweep you and you said no.\n\n1:14:15.220 --> 1:14:17.100\n And then you did, said no again.\n\n1:14:17.100 --> 1:14:19.260\n And then you said no and attacked their leg.\n\n1:14:19.260 --> 1:14:20.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:21.700\n It ceases to be all that gentle\n\n1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:23.060\n because at the end of the day,\n\n1:14:23.060 --> 1:14:25.100\n these dudes are strong as hell.\n\n1:14:25.100 --> 1:14:25.940\n They're flexible.\n\n1:14:25.940 --> 1:14:27.340\n They're all, I mean, they're,\n\n1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:29.420\n the difference between the athleticism\n\n1:14:29.420 --> 1:14:34.420\n and the ability to actually win is a pretty wide gap.\n\n1:14:35.220 --> 1:14:37.220\n The athleticism shows up,\n\n1:14:37.220 --> 1:14:39.460\n but then there's all that other extra\n\n1:14:39.460 --> 1:14:42.460\n and part of that is meanness and pain\n\n1:14:42.460 --> 1:14:45.460\n and getting what you need out of it.\n\n1:14:45.460 --> 1:14:47.980\n But see, there is a philosophical difference\n\n1:14:47.980 --> 1:14:49.540\n in the way it's thought because.\n\n1:14:50.860 --> 1:14:53.300\n I think some of it is just, they just in denial.\n\n1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:55.140\n Like, oh, people will, they like to,\n\n1:14:55.140 --> 1:14:57.460\n people like to espouse a lot of things as theory\n\n1:14:57.460 --> 1:14:59.020\n and then it's like, okay, let me watch.\n\n1:14:59.020 --> 1:15:00.980\n When they're, oh, you're not doing anything\n\n1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:02.060\n about what you said right now.\n\n1:15:02.060 --> 1:15:03.580\n In fact, you're doing the opposite.\n\n1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:05.660\n You're literally hurting that guy\n\n1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:09.260\n because your shit ain't working\n\n1:15:09.260 --> 1:15:10.660\n in the way that you'd like it to.\n\n1:15:10.660 --> 1:15:12.020\n So you're having to use strength.\n\n1:15:12.020 --> 1:15:13.260\n You're having to, it's one of my favorites,\n\n1:15:13.260 --> 1:15:14.620\n like, oh, you're using too much strength.\n\n1:15:14.620 --> 1:15:16.260\n And it's like, well, hold on.\n\n1:15:16.260 --> 1:15:18.900\n Do we want people not to use strength at this point\n\n1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:21.260\n to understand more of mechanics?\n\n1:15:21.260 --> 1:15:22.500\n Or are you trying to tell people\n\n1:15:22.500 --> 1:15:24.020\n if they use strength at all,\n\n1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:26.700\n that they're somehow bad at what they do?\n\n1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:28.300\n Cause you know, it's not my fault.\n\n1:15:28.300 --> 1:15:29.140\n You're not stronger than me.\n\n1:15:29.140 --> 1:15:32.660\n But see, I'm speaking to something else that's, that's.\n\n1:15:32.660 --> 1:15:34.500\n Well, I tend to think what it comes down to is like,\n\n1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:36.900\n strength is fine until you beat me with it.\n\n1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:38.740\n Then it sucks.\n\n1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:41.060\n Okay, so strength is another thing.\n\n1:15:41.060 --> 1:15:44.580\n I'm speaking, I'm thinking about more like anger.\n\n1:15:44.580 --> 1:15:45.580\n Oh, sure.\n\n1:15:45.580 --> 1:15:46.420\n Okay, so like.\n\n1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:48.820\n I've seen a lot of angry guys in jiu jitsu, I know that.\n\n1:15:48.820 --> 1:15:49.660\n Really?\n\n1:15:49.660 --> 1:15:50.500\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:51.740\n Okay, okay, good, well, but let's talk about,\n\n1:15:51.740 --> 1:15:55.300\n let's talk about the highest level of competitions.\n\n1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:56.860\n There's a book called Wrestling Tough.\n\n1:15:56.860 --> 1:15:57.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:57.700 --> 1:15:58.540\n It's a really good book.\n\n1:15:58.540 --> 1:16:01.860\n There's, I've encountered in my life a few,\n\n1:16:01.860 --> 1:16:02.860\n especially in wrestling,\n\n1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:07.860\n people who really try to find a way to use anger,\n\n1:16:08.060 --> 1:16:10.260\n to get really angry at their opponent.\n\n1:16:10.260 --> 1:16:12.660\n Not like stupid anger, but just like.\n\n1:16:12.660 --> 1:16:17.660\n Intense, pointed anger distilled into something\n\n1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:20.740\n that you can use as fuel.\n\n1:16:20.740 --> 1:16:22.500\n And like, I remember this story.\n\n1:16:22.500 --> 1:16:23.420\n I don't know where I read it.\n\n1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:24.740\n Might be Wrestling Tough,\n\n1:16:24.740 --> 1:16:28.180\n where a person was imagining that their opponent\n\n1:16:28.180 --> 1:16:31.420\n just raped their mother, raped their girlfriend\n\n1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:32.260\n or something like that,\n\n1:16:32.260 --> 1:16:35.020\n to create this like method acting thing in their head\n\n1:16:35.020 --> 1:16:38.820\n to be like, to snap them out of this polite interaction\n\n1:16:38.820 --> 1:16:43.060\n of usual like athletic convention and like.\n\n1:16:43.060 --> 1:16:46.460\n You know, that's a design of necessity.\n\n1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:50.540\n So my anecdote for this was,\n\n1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:54.620\n I was sitting with backstage before a fight,\n\n1:16:54.620 --> 1:16:55.860\n not my fight.\n\n1:16:55.860 --> 1:16:58.940\n And I'm working with this guy and this dude is,\n\n1:16:58.940 --> 1:17:00.980\n this is a world champion guy.\n\n1:17:00.980 --> 1:17:03.740\n And he's competed at the highest levels.\n\n1:17:03.740 --> 1:17:06.600\n And he looks at me and he goes,\n\n1:17:08.500 --> 1:17:11.540\n you know, do you ever get nervous before fights?\n\n1:17:11.540 --> 1:17:14.660\n And I looked at him and I went, no, I don't.\n\n1:17:14.660 --> 1:17:15.780\n And he just looks at me and he's like,\n\n1:17:15.780 --> 1:17:17.260\n fuck man, I'm so nervous.\n\n1:17:17.260 --> 1:17:18.580\n You know, how do you do it, man?\n\n1:17:18.580 --> 1:17:19.860\n Or, you know, I wish it could be like you.\n\n1:17:19.860 --> 1:17:21.320\n And I said, you know what?\n\n1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:24.100\n That doesn't mean that what I'm doing is better.\n\n1:17:24.100 --> 1:17:26.060\n It's just what is necessary for me.\n\n1:17:26.060 --> 1:17:27.420\n It's the way I am.\n\n1:17:27.420 --> 1:17:31.500\n And I told him, so this anecdote goes into another anecdote.\n\n1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.260\n This is a Family Guy episode, I guess.\n\n1:17:33.260 --> 1:17:38.260\n So, where some, another famous high level guy told me\n\n1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:44.560\n about this experience with a world champion boxer in Japan.\n\n1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:49.580\n And this guy would get insanely nervous and worked up\n\n1:17:49.580 --> 1:17:51.500\n and anxious before his matches.\n\n1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:53.560\n And he hated it and hated it and hated it.\n\n1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:56.100\n And so he wanted to get rid of that feeling.\n\n1:17:56.100 --> 1:17:58.460\n So he went to a hypnotist for a bunch of sessions\n\n1:17:58.460 --> 1:18:02.340\n and managed to, and he goes in and next fight,\n\n1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:06.260\n he's cool as a cucumber and doesn't perform and loses.\n\n1:18:06.260 --> 1:18:10.020\n And so what I said, going back to anecdote one,\n\n1:18:10.020 --> 1:18:14.420\n was, you know, whatever is necessary for you\n\n1:18:14.420 --> 1:18:18.180\n to get yourself in the best state of being right now\n\n1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:20.540\n to compete, whatever that may be,\n\n1:18:20.540 --> 1:18:23.660\n it could be absolute stress and fear,\n\n1:18:23.660 --> 1:18:25.820\n it could be anger, it could be calmness,\n\n1:18:25.820 --> 1:18:26.780\n it could be whatever.\n\n1:18:26.780 --> 1:18:31.660\n But there is a, but there is a state\n\n1:18:31.660 --> 1:18:34.380\n at which you need to be in to do your best.\n\n1:18:34.380 --> 1:18:36.700\n And you as the individual, you have to find that.\n\n1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:40.940\n Can you comment on Tyson, Mike Tyson?\n\n1:18:40.940 --> 1:18:42.780\n Oh, yeah, that thing.\n\n1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:45.140\n So first, so he, there's two things I wanna,\n\n1:18:45.140 --> 1:18:48.580\n so he's a, in terms of fear, there's a clip there,\n\n1:18:48.580 --> 1:18:50.500\n I think from a documentary where he talks about\n\n1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:54.820\n he is like fully afraid as he walks up to the ring\n\n1:18:54.820 --> 1:18:56.380\n and as he gets closer and closer and closer,\n\n1:18:56.380 --> 1:18:58.620\n he gets more confident until he gets in\n\n1:18:58.620 --> 1:19:00.960\n and then he's a god or something like that.\n\n1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:05.700\n That coupled with his statement on Joe Rogan\n\n1:19:05.700 --> 1:19:10.700\n that he gets aroused at the possibility of true,\n\n1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:12.760\n like of hurting somebody in the ring.\n\n1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:15.120\n So like he gets aroused at the violence.\n\n1:19:16.580 --> 1:19:20.420\n I like it because it's coupled to your basically statement\n\n1:19:20.420 --> 1:19:23.860\n that we need to own, to find our own unique way\n\n1:19:23.860 --> 1:19:28.860\n of existing at our top level of performance.\n\n1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:30.300\n And that perhaps is Mike Tyson.\n\n1:19:30.300 --> 1:19:33.100\n But do you think there's something more deeply universal\n\n1:19:33.100 --> 1:19:35.900\n to the Mike Tyson speaking to the fact\n\n1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:37.740\n that he's aroused at the possibility of violence?\n\n1:19:37.740 --> 1:19:38.680\n Yeah, I do actually.\n\n1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:41.900\n Although I don't think that it always equates to arousal\n\n1:19:41.900 --> 1:19:45.220\n for people, in fact, I would say in general, it doesn't.\n\n1:19:45.220 --> 1:19:47.460\n I can say I've never had a boner in the ring.\n\n1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:50.160\n In fact, if anything, old combat cock is like,\n\n1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:52.780\n we're not hanging around, we're leaving, we're going up.\n\n1:19:52.780 --> 1:19:55.080\n We're taking off, we don't want anything to do with this.\n\n1:19:55.080 --> 1:19:57.860\n You have fun, come back to us when you have something\n\n1:19:57.860 --> 1:20:00.200\n warmer, softer, smells better.\n\n1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:04.900\n But the power, the feeling of aliveness,\n\n1:20:04.900 --> 1:20:06.060\n yeah, I could see it.\n\n1:20:07.380 --> 1:20:09.360\n Back to even the concept of the Ubermensch,\n\n1:20:09.360 --> 1:20:12.580\n I feel like the states, the highest states of being\n\n1:20:12.580 --> 1:20:15.900\n I've ever been in were in the midst of conflict.\n\n1:20:15.900 --> 1:20:17.520\n I felt like that was the times,\n\n1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:20.020\n those are the moments in my life where I felt like\n\n1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:25.020\n I was at the highest level of being as a human in existence.\n\n1:20:25.100 --> 1:20:28.860\n But yet, even being in that state was not,\n\n1:20:28.860 --> 1:20:31.220\n it was not something that you could interact with\n\n1:20:31.220 --> 1:20:33.180\n people that weren't in that state with you.\n\n1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:34.700\n They wouldn't get it, you would almost seem,\n\n1:20:34.700 --> 1:20:36.540\n and to be that way all the time,\n\n1:20:36.540 --> 1:20:40.900\n either A, might drive you mad, or B, is you're not,\n\n1:20:40.900 --> 1:20:43.300\n you're something that's untenable to the rest of society.\n\n1:20:43.300 --> 1:20:45.420\n You can't function with everybody else.\n\n1:20:45.420 --> 1:20:46.740\n It will not work.\n\n1:20:46.740 --> 1:20:48.220\n It's just like you said with the Ubermensch,\n\n1:20:48.220 --> 1:20:50.220\n it's like it's perhaps that ideal\n\n1:20:50.220 --> 1:20:52.180\n is not something you can hold for long.\n\n1:20:52.180 --> 1:20:53.620\n That's the very nature of it is.\n\n1:20:53.620 --> 1:20:56.700\n Yeah, well, there was an example in The Spoke Zarathustra\n\n1:20:56.700 --> 1:21:00.860\n about a snake being down the person's throat\n\n1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:05.860\n and biting it, and then having this maniacal laughter\n\n1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:10.880\n erupting, and to me it was, at least I read it as,\n\n1:21:12.060 --> 1:21:16.780\n yeah, okay, there's this insane moment that isn't forever,\n\n1:21:16.780 --> 1:21:21.500\n but that it is life and death, and the overcoming it\n\n1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:24.620\n is the thing that all of a sudden gives you\n\n1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:27.540\n that tapping into your highest state, right?\n\n1:21:27.540 --> 1:21:32.140\n This is, man is a chasm, a tightrope\n\n1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:35.740\n between man and Ubermensch.\n\n1:21:35.740 --> 1:21:38.420\n Well, I don't wanna leave your thought about,\n\n1:21:39.500 --> 1:21:42.260\n we'll call those things flourishes\n\n1:21:42.260 --> 1:21:47.180\n to the aspect of Tyson's interpretation\n\n1:21:47.180 --> 1:21:51.040\n or his expression of his feelings in combat,\n\n1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.820\n and so I gave this anecdote to the guy,\n\n1:21:53.820 --> 1:21:57.200\n and my first anecdote to that athlete I was working with,\n\n1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:00.200\n and I said, you know, there isn't a superior way\n\n1:22:00.200 --> 1:22:01.040\n in this sense.\n\n1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:02.660\n There is the way that works for you.\n\n1:22:02.660 --> 1:22:05.740\n That may be something you can implement to other people\n\n1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:06.960\n if you find that person,\n\n1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:08.580\n because we all have different personalities,\n\n1:22:08.580 --> 1:22:11.240\n and to me that's an absolute.\n\n1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:13.580\n I don't wanna, don't come at me\n\n1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:16.580\n with all your other fucking social sciences crap.\n\n1:22:16.580 --> 1:22:18.660\n No, we have distinct personalities.\n\n1:22:18.660 --> 1:22:21.380\n That personality, who you really are,\n\n1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:25.260\n and this, again, Heidegger, Dasein, being authentic.\n\n1:22:25.260 --> 1:22:28.060\n If you're authentic with who you are, goods and bads,\n\n1:22:28.060 --> 1:22:30.100\n you will know how to create what that is,\n\n1:22:30.100 --> 1:22:33.840\n and for me, violence and fighting and conflict\n\n1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:36.980\n was something that always felt normal to me,\n\n1:22:36.980 --> 1:22:40.220\n and I don't mean normal in, like I grew up in a war zone\n\n1:22:40.220 --> 1:22:42.980\n or an abusive household or something like that.\n\n1:22:42.980 --> 1:22:45.620\n I just meant that, and I was a kid who was very\n\n1:22:47.300 --> 1:22:49.560\n joyful and inquisitive,\n\n1:22:50.780 --> 1:22:54.740\n and spent a lot of time around older people, of all things,\n\n1:22:54.740 --> 1:22:58.840\n and also, while I don't think I have much capability\n\n1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:02.200\n toward engineering, my mom said that one of the first things\n\n1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:03.540\n as like a little baby,\n\n1:23:03.540 --> 1:23:06.180\n when she put me in my sister's old crib,\n\n1:23:06.180 --> 1:23:08.700\n instead of my sister who just milled about\n\n1:23:08.700 --> 1:23:10.020\n and was fine with it all,\n\n1:23:10.020 --> 1:23:12.060\n the first thing I did was I completely deconstructed it.\n\n1:23:12.060 --> 1:23:12.900\n I didn't break it.\n\n1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:14.500\n I figured out how to pull it apart.\n\n1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.040\n Curiosity about the world, and yet,\n\n1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:18.620\n that wasn't in conflict with the idea of violence?\n\n1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:23.180\n No, not at all, and so being a very joyful and nice kid,\n\n1:23:23.180 --> 1:23:28.180\n but kids are kids, and if kids can find that you respond\n\n1:23:29.300 --> 1:23:34.300\n maybe more easily to agitation, they will agitate you,\n\n1:23:34.580 --> 1:23:36.340\n and if you should stand out in some way\n\n1:23:36.340 --> 1:23:40.260\n by being taller or bigger or something, or caring,\n\n1:23:40.260 --> 1:23:42.740\n especially, they will agitate you.\n\n1:23:42.740 --> 1:23:44.660\n They don't really fully understand it either,\n\n1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:47.300\n and so I don't hold anything against any of the kids\n\n1:23:47.300 --> 1:23:48.800\n that used to pick on me or whatever,\n\n1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:50.540\n especially at the youngest ages.\n\n1:23:50.540 --> 1:23:52.700\n Man, they don't know shit either, so,\n\n1:23:54.140 --> 1:23:57.940\n but once that line was pushed, for me it was,\n\n1:23:57.940 --> 1:24:00.400\n oh, well, I was being cool.\n\n1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:02.420\n Now you're being uncool.\n\n1:24:02.420 --> 1:24:04.500\n Well, then that gives me license for everything,\n\n1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:06.300\n and so, boom, we would just go at it,\n\n1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:07.940\n or kids that would try to initiate a fight,\n\n1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:12.000\n and I was like, okay, and being in that moment\n\n1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.700\n of just going to town with someone else,\n\n1:24:14.700 --> 1:24:18.860\n it just felt like this is, this is.\n\n1:24:18.860 --> 1:24:19.780\n I belong here.\n\n1:24:19.780 --> 1:24:23.180\n Yeah, it was never a problem for me.\n\n1:24:23.180 --> 1:24:27.620\n In fact, if anything, what I had to understand was,\n\n1:24:27.620 --> 1:24:29.780\n well, not only did I learn the hard way,\n\n1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:32.940\n that it doesn't matter, at the end of the day,\n\n1:24:32.940 --> 1:24:36.080\n it doesn't really matter what anybody else does\n\n1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:41.080\n if your response in violence, even to their violence,\n\n1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:42.740\n if you're the winner,\n\n1:24:42.740 --> 1:24:45.580\n is often going to be penalized severely.\n\n1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:51.300\n Society, state apparatus, they don't want any of that.\n\n1:24:51.300 --> 1:24:53.500\n They wanna be the only arbiter of violence\n\n1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:55.460\n in the world, always.\n\n1:24:55.460 --> 1:24:58.200\n But I learned a very difficult lesson with that,\n\n1:24:58.200 --> 1:25:01.140\n and it was really impactful in a negative way on me,\n\n1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:05.300\n but also I had to learn, on an individual sense,\n\n1:25:05.300 --> 1:25:08.120\n to, you need to manage violence, too,\n\n1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:11.940\n because, hey, if someone attacks you\n\n1:25:11.940 --> 1:25:15.180\n or starts a fight with you and you go at it,\n\n1:25:15.180 --> 1:25:16.980\n okay, beating them up is one thing,\n\n1:25:18.060 --> 1:25:21.260\n trying to grab a handful of broken glass from the street\n\n1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:22.380\n and throw it in their face,\n\n1:25:22.380 --> 1:25:25.520\n maybe that's a bit much at seven.\n\n1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:30.520\n So you need to learn what level is necessary,\n\n1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:33.580\n and you need to learn what comes with all,\n\n1:25:33.580 --> 1:25:35.420\n what's the responsibility of,\n\n1:25:35.420 --> 1:25:38.140\n when you enact violence, I mean, you take on something\n\n1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:40.660\n when you have a responsibility for that.\n\n1:25:40.660 --> 1:25:42.840\n This is the extension of your actions.\n\n1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:48.460\n But as I got older, and especially as I found sports,\n\n1:25:49.420 --> 1:25:51.100\n and then combat sports,\n\n1:25:51.980 --> 1:25:54.900\n now this was a place for me to flourish,\n\n1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:59.900\n and to the point where I was more myself in that space\n\n1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:02.780\n than I was outside of it until time enough\n\n1:26:02.780 --> 1:26:05.940\n where I could learn to get this back together again.\n\n1:26:05.940 --> 1:26:09.660\n And I never say that I'll merge the two\n\n1:26:09.660 --> 1:26:10.500\n or anything like that.\n\n1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:12.460\n No, all what happened,\n\n1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:21.460\n my journey from adolescence on to manhood,\n\n1:26:22.500 --> 1:26:24.220\n a huge portion of it,\n\n1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:27.220\n besides the normal finding yourself, whatever, whatever,\n\n1:26:27.220 --> 1:26:32.220\n actually what it was was getting back to who I always was.\n\n1:26:33.100 --> 1:26:33.940\n Getting back to the kid.\n\n1:26:33.940 --> 1:26:35.140\n The curious kid, the kind kid.\n\n1:26:35.140 --> 1:26:36.500\n Getting back to the guy\n\n1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:38.940\n that I should have been allowed to become\n\n1:26:38.940 --> 1:26:43.940\n instead of what happened under the pressures of other things.\n\n1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:49.460\n And the attempt for society and certain people\n\n1:26:50.540 --> 1:26:55.540\n within managerial positions to compress what that was\n\n1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:58.100\n into something that they found more suitable.\n\n1:26:58.100 --> 1:26:59.260\n Yeah, but those pressures allow you\n\n1:26:59.260 --> 1:27:02.300\n to discover this little world, forbidden world,\n\n1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:05.620\n in many ways, of violence that you could explore.\n\n1:27:05.620 --> 1:27:07.380\n Through sport, you can explore it,\n\n1:27:07.380 --> 1:27:11.420\n and it's more socially acceptable to explore it through sport.\n\n1:27:11.420 --> 1:27:12.420\n For sure.\n\n1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:16.540\n But even then, at times, it's socially unacceptable.\n\n1:27:16.540 --> 1:27:21.340\n So I beat Sem Schilt.\n\n1:27:21.340 --> 1:27:24.020\n He cut my right eyebrow.\n\n1:27:24.020 --> 1:27:25.700\n I cut him and busted his nose,\n\n1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:28.780\n and he's bleeding all over me as I have an armbar on top.\n\n1:27:28.780 --> 1:27:31.740\n I'm getting, you know, it's raining blood.\n\n1:27:31.740 --> 1:27:35.860\n Quote some slayer from a lacerated Sem Schilt,\n\n1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:38.540\n bleeding in his horror, creating my structures.\n\n1:27:38.540 --> 1:27:39.580\n Now I shall rain him blood.\n\n1:27:39.580 --> 1:27:44.580\n But I win the fight, armbar, nasty one.\n\n1:27:46.660 --> 1:27:48.860\n I get on my feet, and the first thing I do\n\n1:27:48.860 --> 1:27:52.180\n is I wipe all the blood off onto my hands,\n\n1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:55.580\n and I lick it, and I do my thing.\n\n1:27:55.580 --> 1:27:59.380\n And all the MMA journalists freaked out.\n\n1:27:59.380 --> 1:28:01.100\n Dana Wise, like, man, I don't know about that.\n\n1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:02.740\n You know, we don't want him doing,\n\n1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:04.900\n everybody had this huge problem.\n\n1:28:04.900 --> 1:28:07.700\n And then some folks would even contend,\n\n1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:10.460\n oh, you know, you're trying to do,\n\n1:28:10.460 --> 1:28:12.260\n like, no, no, no, this isn't planned.\n\n1:28:12.260 --> 1:28:13.780\n I don't think of these things.\n\n1:28:13.780 --> 1:28:14.980\n This is how I really feel.\n\n1:28:14.980 --> 1:28:16.860\n This is who I really am.\n\n1:28:16.860 --> 1:28:21.100\n And, you know, it was even kind of comical after the fact,\n\n1:28:21.100 --> 1:28:24.180\n you know, and BJ Penn was on the very card with me,\n\n1:28:24.180 --> 1:28:27.100\n watching him at some point in his career all of a sudden\n\n1:28:27.100 --> 1:28:29.780\n win fights and then do this licking the glove thing,\n\n1:28:29.780 --> 1:28:31.260\n and everyone thinks it's the coolest thing ever.\n\n1:28:31.260 --> 1:28:33.500\n And I'm like, hey, fuck faces.\n\n1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:38.500\n I did this in 2002 or one, 2001,\n\n1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:40.420\n and BJ Penn actually back then was like,\n\n1:28:40.420 --> 1:28:43.500\n dude, you're a badass, you're a killer, you know?\n\n1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:45.100\n Where did that come from?\n\n1:28:45.100 --> 1:28:46.980\n Because that seems like a deeply human moment.\n\n1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:49.820\n I could say, I could just be, you know, goofy about it\n\n1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:52.340\n and call it orgiastic to align with Titan.\n\n1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:53.700\n Are we back to Mike Tyson?\n\n1:28:53.700 --> 1:28:57.940\n Yeah, but Tyson, but no, no, it isn't, it's beyond that.\n\n1:29:00.180 --> 1:29:01.020\n Is it a celebration of human nature?\n\n1:29:01.020 --> 1:29:02.660\n I've had some pretty decent orgasms\n\n1:29:02.660 --> 1:29:04.300\n in my life at this point, I'm 43.\n\n1:29:04.300 --> 1:29:06.340\n So, but no, none have ever compared to that.\n\n1:29:06.340 --> 1:29:09.620\n Like I said, it is a feeling of highest being to me.\n\n1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:10.460\n And I...\n\n1:29:10.460 --> 1:29:11.900\n It's your Ubermensch moment.\n\n1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:15.620\n This is where I feel like the restrictions\n\n1:29:15.620 --> 1:29:20.140\n of general existence in society are gone.\n\n1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:23.740\n And I get to fully live in a state\n\n1:29:23.740 --> 1:29:26.540\n that feels more meaningful, of the most meaning.\n\n1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:28.060\n You know, I think of it as life and death.\n\n1:29:28.060 --> 1:29:32.900\n And it's just, it is the way I'm built.\n\n1:29:32.900 --> 1:29:36.020\n And I don't have, I've never had any problem\n\n1:29:36.020 --> 1:29:36.940\n applying violence.\n\n1:29:36.940 --> 1:29:39.700\n Like it doesn't, I don't know where it comes from\n\n1:29:39.700 --> 1:29:41.180\n or how you would define it or whatever,\n\n1:29:41.180 --> 1:29:44.580\n if you want to stick me under in a psychologist chair,\n\n1:29:44.580 --> 1:29:47.420\n but like I don't, there's a part of me\n\n1:29:47.420 --> 1:29:49.660\n that can just like, no, if I'm gonna apply,\n\n1:29:49.660 --> 1:29:52.820\n I can apply violence to any level and be okay with it.\n\n1:29:52.820 --> 1:29:54.900\n And it doesn't, I don't lose sleep.\n\n1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:56.420\n It doesn't bother me.\n\n1:29:56.420 --> 1:29:57.860\n It's not a problem.\n\n1:29:57.860 --> 1:30:02.860\n It was me learning how to fully understand violence,\n\n1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:07.380\n humans, and the broader perspective\n\n1:30:07.380 --> 1:30:08.980\n that allowed me to think about things\n\n1:30:08.980 --> 1:30:12.780\n and like, well, what do I really want to accomplish\n\n1:30:12.780 --> 1:30:15.180\n with my actions in the world just on a whole?\n\n1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:18.860\n You know, not compartmentalizing my sporting career.\n\n1:30:18.860 --> 1:30:21.260\n Even when I get in the ring,\n\n1:30:21.260 --> 1:30:24.460\n I don't have any mercy generally.\n\n1:30:24.460 --> 1:30:29.460\n And if I do, it's because I make a really deliberate attempt\n\n1:30:30.260 --> 1:30:33.380\n to be in a state where I can have mercy.\n\n1:30:33.380 --> 1:30:36.620\n If I just go in there to fight with everything I got,\n\n1:30:36.620 --> 1:30:37.460\n there is zero mercy.\n\n1:30:37.460 --> 1:30:38.300\n The natural state of violence.\n\n1:30:38.300 --> 1:30:40.100\n There's nothing, there's nothing that will hold me back\n\n1:30:40.100 --> 1:30:42.860\n other than the referee and that's that.\n\n1:30:42.860 --> 1:30:45.980\n You know, I know I agreed to be allowed to do\n\n1:30:45.980 --> 1:30:49.420\n and not to do, but within that, no.\n\n1:30:49.420 --> 1:30:51.980\n And I expect it to be done to me.\n\n1:30:51.980 --> 1:30:56.300\n But in terms of values, in terms of seeing what,\n\n1:30:56.300 --> 1:31:01.300\n to me, violence is just yet another canvas\n\n1:31:01.580 --> 1:31:04.860\n that humans can paint beautifully on.\n\n1:31:04.860 --> 1:31:07.720\n Clearly, I mean, we have venerated the violent.\n\n1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:11.840\n There are communists that venerate the violent\n\n1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:12.920\n on their behalf.\n\n1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:14.480\n There are national socialists\n\n1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:16.240\n that venerate the violent there.\n\n1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:19.240\n And then if you remove it from an ideological perspective,\n\n1:31:19.240 --> 1:31:23.680\n we venerate the violent when they're a hero.\n\n1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:26.980\n We venerate the violent in our religion.\n\n1:31:26.980 --> 1:31:29.240\n Well, I mean, I guess some people venerate the violence\n\n1:31:29.240 --> 1:31:32.360\n of Yahweh and Sodom and Gomorrah, right?\n\n1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:34.720\n So, or do we say Jehovah?\n\n1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:35.560\n I don't know.\n\n1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:38.920\n Is there, you've already mentioned one,\n\n1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:42.520\n but is there a fight where you've achieved\n\n1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:46.180\n the highest of heights for your own personal being\n\n1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:48.440\n just when you look within yourself\n\n1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:49.860\n that you're the proudest of,\n\n1:31:49.860 --> 1:31:51.900\n or maybe it was your most beautiful creation?\n\n1:31:51.900 --> 1:31:52.740\n Is there something that stands out?\n\n1:31:52.740 --> 1:31:54.880\n Yeah, there are a few, actually.\n\n1:31:54.880 --> 1:31:57.040\n Fighting Semishield and a rematch.\n\n1:31:57.040 --> 1:31:58.840\n Well, the first one was pretty good, too.\n\n1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:01.640\n But the rematch was, I was suffering,\n\n1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:04.980\n I had suffered prior, the week prior,\n\n1:32:04.980 --> 1:32:07.360\n to food poisoning.\n\n1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:09.840\n And so while my abs are looking all right,\n\n1:32:11.080 --> 1:32:16.080\n I, in the ring, didn't have the power that I expected to.\n\n1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:19.600\n And I was struggling in ways,\n\n1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:22.740\n in some of the grappling with the submission stuff\n\n1:32:22.740 --> 1:32:24.200\n that I hadn't accounted for.\n\n1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:26.760\n Just exhaustion or mental exhaustion?\n\n1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:28.680\n No, I mean, just physical,\n\n1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:32.080\n I wasn't back up to 100% in terms of just power output.\n\n1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:36.760\n And Semi was, well, he's always seven foot tall.\n\n1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:38.600\n But this time he was, the first time I fought him,\n\n1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:43.600\n he was 260, or 257, or 260 something, something like that.\n\n1:32:44.900 --> 1:32:46.760\n This time he was like 290.\n\n1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:48.940\n And so he was a significantly bigger cat.\n\n1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:51.160\n And he's a big dude.\n\n1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:56.160\n And I just remember being up against the ropes with him,\n\n1:32:57.940 --> 1:33:00.280\n changing levels, trying to take him down.\n\n1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:01.760\n And he's fighting, and he's hippin'.\n\n1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:03.560\n And I just thought in my head,\n\n1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:05.320\n there's no fuckin way I'm gonna lose this fight.\n\n1:33:05.320 --> 1:33:07.200\n There's no way, you are not going to beat me.\n\n1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:08.560\n It's not gonna happen.\n\n1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:11.120\n And I armbarred him, the other arm.\n\n1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:12.520\n Even out of the fact he's like,\n\n1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:13.840\n man, I really wanted to get you for that,\n\n1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:15.000\n I wanted to get that match back.\n\n1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:16.760\n And then you fuckin got my other arm, dick.\n\n1:33:16.760 --> 1:33:19.280\n And I'm like, eh, dude, I still love you though.\n\n1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:20.180\n You know, and that.\n\n1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:22.240\n But the whole time you're like,\n\n1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:24.800\n so this has to do with the dichotomy\n\n1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:27.080\n of you're feeling your worst.\n\n1:33:27.080 --> 1:33:28.280\n And having to overcome.\n\n1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:30.300\n You're like literally mentally telling yourself\n\n1:33:30.300 --> 1:33:31.140\n there's no way.\n\n1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:32.760\n There's no fuckin way I'm gonna lose this fight.\n\n1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:35.400\n And then there's even my last bare knuckle match.\n\n1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:39.480\n And getting in the ring and fighting bare knuckle boxing\n\n1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:40.480\n for the first time.\n\n1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:45.480\n And just thinking, just being in a great state.\n\n1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:48.800\n And just looking so forward to seeing.\n\n1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:51.520\n I mean, I called someone.\n\n1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:52.720\n I was talking to them the night before.\n\n1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:56.080\n And I said, yeah, well, I video called you\n\n1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:58.820\n because this face might not look like this\n\n1:33:58.820 --> 1:33:59.960\n when I see you next.\n\n1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:03.200\n And they're just like, ooh, uh, okay.\n\n1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:05.040\n That's not just like empty trash talk.\n\n1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:09.040\n That's like a clarity of mind and a seriousness about.\n\n1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:11.000\n I go, I might die.\n\n1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:14.760\n Most, pretty high chance of being deformed some way.\n\n1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:16.040\n So, but fuck it.\n\n1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:16.880\n I don't really care.\n\n1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:17.860\n Are you, do you think about,\n\n1:34:17.860 --> 1:34:19.560\n are you accepting your own death?\n\n1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:21.280\n Yes, 100%.\n\n1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:24.120\n Yeah, I, in fact, and that's, in a strange way,\n\n1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:26.360\n that's partially what makes it so elevated\n\n1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:29.160\n in terms of my sense of feeling.\n\n1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:34.160\n By being able to have death at my side, it feels good.\n\n1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:41.960\n And to be there and to think that this could be the one,\n\n1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:43.760\n like, why not, you know?\n\n1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:46.120\n I'm not a religious person at all,\n\n1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:48.480\n even though I very much have to seem,\n\n1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:50.800\n it seems to bang on the drum about the usefulness\n\n1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:53.600\n or understanding the usefulness of religion for people.\n\n1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:58.300\n But, you know, if I gotta do something,\n\n1:34:58.300 --> 1:34:59.840\n then yeah, put me in Valhalla, man.\n\n1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:00.960\n I don't wanna be anywhere else.\n\n1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.800\n Nothing else seems like a good place for me to be.\n\n1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:06.200\n I wanna fight all day long and feast all night.\n\n1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:07.720\n You know, it sounds great.\n\n1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:11.960\n I saw you throw your hat into the ring of Fader Emelianenko.\n\n1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:13.280\n Yes.\n\n1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:14.440\n He got COVID, I guess.\n\n1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:17.720\n I hope he overcomes it and comes out just as good,\n\n1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:18.560\n if not better.\n\n1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:19.380\n Epic with that.\n\n1:35:19.380 --> 1:35:21.960\n Did I understand correctly that might be his last fight?\n\n1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:24.120\n Yes, that's my understanding.\n\n1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:25.400\n And it would be epic as hell.\n\n1:35:25.400 --> 1:35:26.600\n And it would be epic as hell\n\n1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:31.200\n because the person that I wanna give my most to\n\n1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:32.980\n is a person that I respect,\n\n1:35:32.980 --> 1:35:37.980\n especially at this long career of mine\n\n1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:41.000\n and getting at this twilight years.\n\n1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:42.360\n It's like two warriors.\n\n1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:45.300\n And that's the thing about even this going in there\n\n1:35:45.300 --> 1:35:47.880\n with the aspect of being with death and all that\n\n1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:51.040\n is that when that person is in there,\n\n1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:52.920\n they are my brother with me in this.\n\n1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:55.120\n And so when you give me your best,\n\n1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:58.200\n even if I win dominant fashion,\n\n1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:00.520\n but if you show up and you're as authentic\n\n1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:03.000\n and being here as I am, then I love you.\n\n1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:04.220\n And I'm glad for you to be here.\n\n1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:05.320\n And we're in this together.\n\n1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:10.320\n And at this point, your loss or my loss or whatever\n\n1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:14.560\n is no less deserving of veneration than the win.\n\n1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:15.880\n Like we're here in this.\n\n1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:18.040\n And so to be in the ring with F\u00fchrer\n\n1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:21.360\n and to venerate him in win or defeat,\n\n1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:26.360\n to be in there with someone like that is, to me,\n\n1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:30.320\n it's so rare, so.\n\n1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:33.200\n It's incredible how the ultimate violence\n\n1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:37.760\n is coupled with love or respect.\n\n1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:42.760\n And it's weird how the competition in its violent form\n\n1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:50.400\n is also a veneration of just human connection.\n\n1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:51.240\n Human connection.\n\n1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:52.320\n It's also the removal.\n\n1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:55.640\n I feel like it's the purest, one of the purest ways,\n\n1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:59.120\n purest, most honest places a person can exist.\n\n1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:00.880\n That line in Fight Club, you don't know really\n\n1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:02.120\n who you are until you've been in a fight.\n\n1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:03.520\n I mean, I believe that.\n\n1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:06.440\n And I've seen so many examples of people\n\n1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:09.460\n trying to portray themselves as one thing.\n\n1:37:09.460 --> 1:37:12.840\n And then in the ring, you see who they really are.\n\n1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:15.160\n Or even when they're trying to portray themselves\n\n1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:18.060\n as one thing and they're winning,\n\n1:37:18.060 --> 1:37:21.240\n the crowd, at times, will see who they really are\n\n1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:22.880\n and still hate them, you know?\n\n1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:25.720\n And it's like, well, I said all the good things.\n\n1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:27.720\n Bro, don't work that way.\n\n1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:29.440\n Yeah, but speaking of F\u00fchrer,\n\n1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:31.440\n if we take you out of the picture,\n\n1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:33.680\n who are the greatest mixed martial arts fighters\n\n1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:34.520\n of all time?\n\n1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:36.720\n I feel.\n\n1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:38.240\n You out of the picture.\n\n1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:40.640\n As a cop out, to some degree,\n\n1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:43.980\n I feel like we need a little bit more time, you know?\n\n1:37:43.980 --> 1:37:47.340\n So, to see how this unfolds.\n\n1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:48.800\n Because you gotta compare a lot of things.\n\n1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:52.400\n And I, did I, I think I'm.\n\n1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:53.240\n Like centuries?\n\n1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:54.120\n I did an interview.\n\n1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:55.080\n I don't know about centuries.\n\n1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:57.200\n But that would help if we can keep accurate records\n\n1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.620\n and not allow too much bias to fall in.\n\n1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:02.460\n Too much propaganda.\n\n1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:03.600\n The victor's still there, right?\n\n1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:08.600\n Yeah, but I made an argument.\n\n1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:13.000\n I was in, I get a, it was a interview\n\n1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:14.400\n with an MMA outlet of some sort.\n\n1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:16.320\n And I can't recall who it was.\n\n1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:18.860\n But, oh, it was an argument about\n\n1:38:18.860 --> 1:38:23.860\n will the winner of Cain Velasquez versus Steve Amiocik\n\n1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:26.540\n be the greatest MMA heavyweight of all time?\n\n1:38:26.540 --> 1:38:29.160\n And I said, fucking no way.\n\n1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:31.040\n Oh no, it was Cormier Amiocik.\n\n1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:32.000\n That's what it was.\n\n1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:33.440\n I said, absolutely not.\n\n1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:35.160\n Not even close.\n\n1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:37.360\n And I said, these guys need a bit more time\n\n1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:39.320\n to see how things go.\n\n1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.160\n And also how things go for some of their opponents.\n\n1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:43.600\n And like, there's more factors than just this one fight.\n\n1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:44.440\n It really is.\n\n1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:47.680\n And I go, and when you wanna weigh these people,\n\n1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:50.900\n even if let's say, we'll bring Alistair Overeem\n\n1:38:50.900 --> 1:38:52.780\n into the end of the equation.\n\n1:38:52.780 --> 1:38:56.080\n Okay, you judge him on what you know now,\n\n1:38:56.080 --> 1:38:58.440\n what he's done for you lately, okay?\n\n1:38:58.440 --> 1:38:59.340\n Right.\n\n1:38:59.340 --> 1:39:01.920\n Which is a very myopic way of doing it.\n\n1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:04.560\n What has he done over his career?\n\n1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:06.440\n K1 champion.\n\n1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:10.520\n He was a champion in DREAM.\n\n1:39:12.060 --> 1:39:13.920\n He, Strike Force, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:15.640\n His overall record.\n\n1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:18.160\n The entirety of all the different opponents he's fought.\n\n1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:22.620\n And I just sit back and I go, okay, he's not the UFC champ.\n\n1:39:22.620 --> 1:39:27.300\n But his accolades, his merits,\n\n1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:32.940\n in some ways, actually stand up higher\n\n1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:35.520\n than Cormier's and Amiocik's.\n\n1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:38.760\n So what about the moments, do you give much value\n\n1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:42.840\n to the special moments, like the highest heights\n\n1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:46.560\n you rise to, not in terms of records or the strikes landed,\n\n1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:50.280\n but just creating a magical moment in a fight?\n\n1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:52.320\n It doesn't have to be even a championship fight,\n\n1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:55.440\n but just, Conor McGregor is an example\n\n1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:57.040\n of somebody who creates a narrative,\n\n1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:59.120\n who creates a story, who creates a drama,\n\n1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:02.440\n and a special magic happens, even if it's like, not with.\n\n1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:04.360\n Myth is greater than reality.\n\n1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:05.480\n And that is always the case.\n\n1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:06.320\n But do you.\n\n1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:08.200\n And so I understand that so very much,\n\n1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:12.960\n and it takes an asshole like me to poo poo on your myth.\n\n1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:14.960\n They at least get you, at the end of the day,\n\n1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.480\n you're not gonna abandon your myth,\n\n1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:21.480\n but perhaps temper it with the facts and logic.\n\n1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:24.080\n So you're not a fan of myth?\n\n1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:26.500\n No, I'm an absolute massive fan of myth.\n\n1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:28.040\n But you prefer facts and logic.\n\n1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:29.720\n It's like when I, no, I mean.\n\n1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:33.280\n I like saying facts and logic, because people,\n\n1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:36.200\n I also, I am not a materialist in that sense.\n\n1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:38.680\n I don't think that materialism can solve for everything.\n\n1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:39.520\n It's not enough.\n\n1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:41.320\n It's not robust enough, I'm sorry.\n\n1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.240\n If facts and logic and, or reason,\n\n1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:46.520\n as the Enlightenment scholars all thought,\n\n1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:49.600\n including Marx, was enough for people,\n\n1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:53.320\n then we would never, we wouldn't have any religions.\n\n1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:55.360\n We wouldn't have any, like there would be no,\n\n1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:56.760\n we wouldn't have narratives and myths\n\n1:40:56.760 --> 1:40:58.060\n and all this kind of stuff.\n\n1:40:58.060 --> 1:41:00.480\n It would not, it just, I'm sorry, there is no,\n\n1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:04.000\n there's nothing about history that supports the idea\n\n1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:07.660\n that rationality will overcome all.\n\n1:41:07.660 --> 1:41:09.640\n There's something about Ben Shapiro's facts\n\n1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:10.880\n don't care about your feelings,\n\n1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:14.880\n that feels to be miss, feels to be missing\n\n1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:16.600\n something fundamental about human nature.\n\n1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:20.200\n It's not clear to me exactly what is missing.\n\n1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:24.720\n To give old Ben a fair shake.\n\n1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:27.240\n And I don't know Ben Shapiro.\n\n1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:29.000\n I don't really listen to Ben Shapiro,\n\n1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:30.720\n not against Ben Shapiro.\n\n1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:33.560\n I don't, I'm not here to say anything\n\n1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:35.840\n particularly bad about him.\n\n1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.200\n Although I will say at one time,\n\n1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:39.700\n Tom Arnold was seemingly trying to pick\n\n1:41:39.700 --> 1:41:42.180\n an actionable fight with Ben Shapiro.\n\n1:41:42.180 --> 1:41:43.020\n In the ring.\n\n1:41:43.020 --> 1:41:44.600\n Or in the. Somewhere, yeah.\n\n1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:46.280\n And I just, and I actually responded,\n\n1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:48.200\n I like, and I tried to get him to clarify,\n\n1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:50.880\n I said, hey, are you saying that you want to fight\n\n1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:52.920\n Ben Shapiro, that you're looking to actually,\n\n1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:54.480\n because I was waiting for him to say something\n\n1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:56.020\n and then I can be like, okay, well,\n\n1:41:56.020 --> 1:41:58.120\n it's one thing to want to get into a fight with someone.\n\n1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:01.160\n It's another thing to go pick on a little tiny,\n\n1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:04.520\n you know, guy like Ben, who's much smaller than you\n\n1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:06.280\n and doesn't train or whatever, but you know,\n\n1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:08.360\n if it's not me, I can find someone your size\n\n1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:09.800\n and you can go fight him.\n\n1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:11.440\n You know, don't be a, basically,\n\n1:42:11.440 --> 1:42:13.480\n don't be a bully piece of shit.\n\n1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:15.520\n Yeah. You know, which by the way,\n\n1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:17.480\n Tom Arnold, you are a mental midget.\n\n1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:20.220\n You are never going to be able to compete\n\n1:42:20.220 --> 1:42:22.040\n even with Ben Shapiro in an argument\n\n1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:23.920\n on any level about anything.\n\n1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:25.000\n Oh, intellectual argument.\n\n1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:26.640\n Yeah, intellectual argument.\n\n1:42:26.640 --> 1:42:29.600\n Maybe you can scream louder than him, but whatever.\n\n1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:34.600\n But nevertheless, in the discussion of greatness in fighting.\n\n1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:37.640\n I think you need to look at some of the numbers.\n\n1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:39.120\n You need to look at some of the numbers.\n\n1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:40.240\n And there's the magic.\n\n1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:42.920\n There is some context also in that,\n\n1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:45.200\n where did Alistair Overeem fight?\n\n1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:47.400\n Oh, he fought in Pride, where you could soccer kick people\n\n1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:48.840\n and stomp their head and this and that.\n\n1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:53.360\n And so the game environment is actually different too.\n\n1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:55.720\n There's more uncertainty, there's more chaos in Pride,\n\n1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:56.560\n there's more.\n\n1:42:56.560 --> 1:42:58.800\n Go back a little further and go like,\n\n1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:00.200\n what about the guys that used to,\n\n1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:02.880\n like Dan Severn fought bare knuckle,\n\n1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:04.480\n head butts, the whole nine.\n\n1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:05.560\n You beat Dan Severn, right?\n\n1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:06.560\n I did beat Dan Severn.\n\n1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:08.960\n That was killing an idol, so to speak.\n\n1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:11.520\n Although I didn't really kill him because I still love him.\n\n1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:13.360\n He's still an, I mean, he's still responsible\n\n1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:17.400\n for inspiration along this whole pathway.\n\n1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:21.400\n It's meeting your God and then putting a knife in it,\n\n1:43:21.400 --> 1:43:22.240\n I guess.\n\n1:43:22.240 --> 1:43:27.000\n Realizing they're human and then bringing them down\n\n1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:27.840\n to your level.\n\n1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:31.360\n Exactly, but also there's a huge misconception there\n\n1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:33.040\n and that is that I could bring,\n\n1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:35.800\n maybe I could bring Dan Severn down to my level,\n\n1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:38.680\n but I couldn't bring his mustache down to my level.\n\n1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:41.160\n It is of mythic proportions and...\n\n1:43:41.160 --> 1:43:42.840\n Greater than yours.\n\n1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:44.560\n Your facial hair is greater than yours.\n\n1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:47.920\n My facial hair is creating its own legacy,\n\n1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:50.320\n but it is not Dan Severn mustache level\n\n1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:52.680\n or now Don Fry mustache.\n\n1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:55.760\n So Don Fry mustache, Dan Severn mustache.\n\n1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:58.440\n Now you have like Shia versus Sunni.\n\n1:43:58.440 --> 1:43:59.280\n Right.\n\n1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:00.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:00.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:04.320\n You think there'll be a Karl Marx painting\n\n1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:06.440\n of Josh Barnett one day with the beard\n\n1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:08.160\n and is that basically what you're trying to say?\n\n1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:09.000\n I hope so.\n\n1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:12.120\n I will actually comb my hair, unlike Marx, but...\n\n1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:16.440\n Chaos has a charm to it.\n\n1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:17.400\n It does, it does.\n\n1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:20.400\n I mean, we all thought Doc Brown in Back to the Future\n\n1:44:20.400 --> 1:44:22.240\n was quite charming.\n\n1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:23.760\n You have to throw that into the calculation\n\n1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:24.800\n where they fought.\n\n1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:25.640\n Yes.\n\n1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:26.480\n This is the interesting thing.\n\n1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:27.320\n And the rules that they fought under.\n\n1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:32.320\n Some guy like Eerov Chanchin won a 32 man tournament\n\n1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:33.260\n or something like that.\n\n1:44:33.260 --> 1:44:34.300\n I go, okay.\n\n1:44:36.420 --> 1:44:39.480\n Steepa and Daniel Cormier are awesome\n\n1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:44.480\n and they will for sure be revered for their careers.\n\n1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:48.560\n 100%.\n\n1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:52.480\n Can you say that they're particularly even better overall\n\n1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:53.960\n than Eerov Chanchin?\n\n1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:55.780\n Well, maybe one of them could have beat them.\n\n1:44:55.780 --> 1:44:57.560\n Maybe one of them wouldn't have.\n\n1:44:57.560 --> 1:44:59.640\n Maybe Eerov would have got them\n\n1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:01.040\n with the knuckles right away.\n\n1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:02.400\n Well, maybe if they fought them in pride,\n\n1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:03.240\n they wouldn't have won.\n\n1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:05.700\n Maybe if they fought them bare knuckle, they wouldn't won.\n\n1:45:05.700 --> 1:45:06.540\n I don't know.\n\n1:45:06.540 --> 1:45:07.720\n And there's something about the chaos,\n\n1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:11.240\n like do you put Royce Gracie in the top 10?\n\n1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:12.240\n There's something about...\n\n1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:17.240\n Top 10 of all time in terms of competitors is capable.\n\n1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:19.860\n I don't know.\n\n1:45:19.860 --> 1:45:20.700\n I'd have to think about that.\n\n1:45:20.700 --> 1:45:24.520\n Maybe not, but I put Royce Gracie as like pyramid level.\n\n1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:28.600\n Like, wow, dude, what an amazing man.\n\n1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:29.920\n Yeah, he's so important.\n\n1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:32.000\n Absolutely, incredibly important.\n\n1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:36.200\n But there's something about stepping into,\n\n1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:37.760\n like fighting another human being\n\n1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:40.640\n under all the uncertainty that the early UFCs had.\n\n1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:41.680\n I mean, you don't know.\n\n1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:42.520\n Yup.\n\n1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:43.520\n What is going to happen?\n\n1:45:43.520 --> 1:45:46.780\n And coupled that with not much money.\n\n1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:47.640\n Yup.\n\n1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:48.480\n All of it.\n\n1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:49.320\n Yes.\n\n1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:50.440\n So the purity of it too.\n\n1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:51.680\n There's something about money.\n\n1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:54.040\n I mean, I guess it's shit for that cat post world,\n\n1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:57.200\n but that ruins the purity of the violence.\n\n1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:00.880\n Yeah, people given the opportunity for...\n\n1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:03.280\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:46:03.280 --> 1:46:04.680\n The bigger things get, the more...\n\n1:46:04.680 --> 1:46:07.280\n I love the fact that fighting has opened up\n\n1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:12.280\n to such a degree that the career business side of it,\n\n1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:16.400\n because I absolutely distinctly separate the two.\n\n1:46:16.400 --> 1:46:18.600\n The business side of it has opened up\n\n1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:20.260\n to give me far more possibilities,\n\n1:46:20.260 --> 1:46:23.160\n opened way more doors for me than I ever intended it to.\n\n1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:29.840\n Whereas the athlete side of things has,\n\n1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:33.680\n if anything, just gotten substantially worse, I would say.\n\n1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:38.680\n And some of this is due to the nature of all games\n\n1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:44.480\n will be learned, will be gamed\n\n1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.800\n without even the rules being broken.\n\n1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:51.240\n And once that's figured out, you need to make an adjustment.\n\n1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:53.660\n No adjustments have been made.\n\n1:46:53.660 --> 1:46:56.480\n So the game just appears to be the same game\n\n1:46:56.480 --> 1:46:59.520\n over and over and over and over and over again\n\n1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:02.720\n on ESPN+, on whatever, on whatever, on whatever.\n\n1:47:02.720 --> 1:47:04.680\n It doesn't really matter which night you watch.\n\n1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:06.880\n It's the same game constantly.\n\n1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:11.880\n And that's not because the athletes are worse or better.\n\n1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:16.460\n It's because they have had that game structure long enough\n\n1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:19.040\n that they figured out what do you do\n\n1:47:19.040 --> 1:47:21.280\n to be the most successful at it?\n\n1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:23.320\n What is the highest percentage way of approaching it,\n\n1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:26.240\n essentially, even if you're not thinking of percentages?\n\n1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:28.040\n What were the...\n\n1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:30.000\n If we take a step back, it's really fascinating\n\n1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:31.880\n to think about the early UFCs.\n\n1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:33.640\n Did you fight Dan Severn in the UFC?\n\n1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:35.240\n I fought him in Super Brawl.\n\n1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:37.160\n Super Brawl, so that was in the early, early days,\n\n1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:38.600\n your undefeated... 2000.\n\n1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.480\n What were those early days, let's say,\n\n1:47:43.480 --> 1:47:45.400\n of mixed martial arts like?\n\n1:47:46.540 --> 1:47:49.160\n Let me tell you the day of high adventure.\n\n1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:54.160\n Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.\n\n1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:55.400\n Yeah, it is.\n\n1:47:55.400 --> 1:47:56.680\n It was so much fun.\n\n1:47:56.680 --> 1:48:01.680\n And it made you feel absolutely like you were a part of a novel,\n\n1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:04.480\n a comic book.\n\n1:48:04.480 --> 1:48:08.880\n I mean, I would love to transcribe my experiences\n\n1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:11.720\n as what I consider a second generation MMA athlete,\n\n1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:18.000\n except I'm way too sensitive to anybody's personal,\n\n1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:25.360\n any things that are not even to...\n\n1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:26.640\n I'm not a gossipy person.\n\n1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:29.920\n I really do believe that small people talk about others.\n\n1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:31.680\n Big people talk about ideas.\n\n1:48:34.220 --> 1:48:36.940\n But there's just some stories that you can't tell\n\n1:48:36.940 --> 1:48:38.240\n without telling the whole story.\n\n1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:43.240\n And there are so many amazing stories that could be told.\n\n1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:45.800\n People being at their best, people being at their worst.\n\n1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:48.120\n Yeah, the whole niche of gossip.\n\n1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:51.840\n Is there something you could speak to the chaos of the time?\n\n1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:53.160\n Oh, 100%.\n\n1:48:53.160 --> 1:48:57.760\n Well, okay, so we at AMC got connected to somebody\n\n1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:00.040\n that was throwing an event in Nampa, Idaho,\n\n1:49:00.040 --> 1:49:02.240\n and we all piled into this.\n\n1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:07.140\n And Matt Humes, Subaru Wagon, and we jammed out.\n\n1:49:07.140 --> 1:49:10.880\n And we left Kirkland and we headed over to Idaho,\n\n1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:15.880\n only to find out that there was nothing really put in place.\n\n1:49:15.880 --> 1:49:21.880\n Nothing really put in place, it was absolute disrepair and chaos.\n\n1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:26.200\n They didn't have a rain, they didn't have this.\n\n1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:28.520\n It was such a bullshit adventure.\n\n1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:33.520\n But we were like, well, there's hardly anywhere to fight.\n\n1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:36.280\n It's tough to find these opportunities.\n\n1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:39.400\n So, okay, well, how about this?\n\n1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:42.960\n Whoever is here to fight and is willing,\n\n1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.040\n all right, well, since there's no venue, there's no this,\n\n1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:48.680\n whatever, we all got gloves, we got mouthpieces,\n\n1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:51.640\n we'll just go to the park, as long as we still get paid.\n\n1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:56.240\n And so folks were kind of like, I don't know about that.\n\n1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:01.240\n The guy I was gonna fight was, he finally gets information\n\n1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:05.560\n on who I actually am, and I was undefeated at the time.\n\n1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:09.320\n I think I had fought Super Brawl 13\n\n1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:10.480\n and already won that tournament.\n\n1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:13.960\n And so he's like, yeah, I had no clue.\n\n1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:16.920\n I'm so glad we didn't fight, you would have murdered me.\n\n1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:18.360\n What a setup.\n\n1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:21.760\n And eventually Matt had to strong arm the guy\n\n1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:24.080\n and get our money that we were supposed to all get\n\n1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:25.560\n and drive back.\n\n1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:27.320\n And because his whole position was,\n\n1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:28.440\n well, there ain't no fucking way,\n\n1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:31.560\n we drove all the way out here for free.\n\n1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:35.440\n This is on you, you fucked this up, not my problem.\n\n1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:38.360\n But what is my problem is the lack of cash in my account.\n\n1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:43.360\n So fix it, or me fighting my first organized fight\n\n1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:50.400\n against an AMC guy on 11 days notice\n\n1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:54.560\n through a connection to an old wrestling coach I had.\n\n1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:59.560\n And I just gathered up with all my old martial arts instructor\n\n1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:04.760\n that I had worked with and we grappled in his apartment.\n\n1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:07.520\n We did tie pads in the park.\n\n1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:10.960\n I ran a couple miles every day and then,\n\n1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:12.160\n all right, boom, show it up.\n\n1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:14.600\n Won my fight by front choke in two minutes.\n\n1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:19.360\n And then Matt goes, okay, well, hey, you did really great.\n\n1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:21.240\n We'd like you to come back and fight again in the summer.\n\n1:51:21.240 --> 1:51:22.440\n What do you think?\n\n1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:24.920\n Okay, go back off the university.\n\n1:51:24.920 --> 1:51:28.440\n And then I think, hmm, well, that fight didn't go exactly\n\n1:51:28.440 --> 1:51:29.920\n as how I wanted it to.\n\n1:51:29.920 --> 1:51:33.680\n So I gotta find a way to get more experience.\n\n1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:37.520\n I would literally fight people in the university,\n\n1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:40.920\n like rec center on the old wrestling mats,\n\n1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:42.480\n as they didn't know I had a wrestling team.\n\n1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:44.480\n I would find anyone doing martial arts,\n\n1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:46.480\n anyone talking about getting into street fights,\n\n1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:48.520\n anyone, whatever, and just basically go,\n\n1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:50.480\n oh, you ever watch UFC?\n\n1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:51.840\n Yeah, yeah, that stuff's cool.\n\n1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:52.680\n What do you think?\n\n1:51:52.680 --> 1:51:55.160\n Oh, man, I'm super into it, man, it's badass.\n\n1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:56.000\n Rad.\n\n1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:59.240\n So would you wanna fight?\n\n1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:04.000\n Would you wanna fight? I mean, it was way easier picking fights\n\n1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.320\n than it was, you know, getting a girlfriend.\n\n1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:10.160\n So I just, you know, path least resistance.\n\n1:52:10.160 --> 1:52:11.920\n I think it might be useful for us\n\n1:52:11.920 --> 1:52:14.320\n to get some advice from you.\n\n1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:15.240\n Yeah, all right.\n\n1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:16.960\n Because you've accomplished,\n\n1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:21.120\n for the journey of a martial artist first,\n\n1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:23.960\n if you accomplish some of the greatest accolades\n\n1:52:23.960 --> 1:52:27.240\n there is in the sport, if somebody who's starting out now,\n\n1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:31.800\n or early on in their journey, what advice would you give\n\n1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:36.800\n on how to become a martial artist, catch wrestler, a fighter?\n\n1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:41.800\n Well, I mean, really what it comes down to\n\n1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:43.480\n is do it because you love it.\n\n1:52:43.480 --> 1:52:46.200\n Do it for that reason and that reason alone.\n\n1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:49.400\n Most people that get into this\n\n1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:53.320\n and attempt to make any sort of professional inroads with it,\n\n1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:55.560\n you are not going to be the world champion.\n\n1:52:55.560 --> 1:52:59.160\n You probably will never even fight for a belt\n\n1:52:59.160 --> 1:53:03.320\n and you're probably not going to net make money at this.\n\n1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:06.160\n So don't do it for those reasons.\n\n1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:08.240\n Do it for the reason of the passion.\n\n1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:10.320\n Do it for the reason to be the absolute best\n\n1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:13.080\n that you can be, whatever that ends up being.\n\n1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:16.960\n You might at best only be mediocre,\n\n1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:18.800\n but you won't even be mediocre if you don't do it\n\n1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:20.320\n like you really mean it.\n\n1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:21.160\n So.\n\n1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:24.400\n The passion, look, where is the kernel of the passion,\n\n1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:26.640\n would you say, is it in the learning process itself,\n\n1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:27.680\n the improvement?\n\n1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:29.480\n I think it really depends on the person, right?\n\n1:53:29.480 --> 1:53:32.960\n I mean, there's some people that really love the fact of,\n\n1:53:33.880 --> 1:53:36.160\n they feel like they're growing, right?\n\n1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:38.600\n Well to power, you're growing, growing stronger,\n\n1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:39.440\n growing better.\n\n1:53:41.400 --> 1:53:44.640\n The idea of eliminating weakness.\n\n1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:48.640\n So, to which I'll quickly define weakness\n\n1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:51.200\n as just like things that weaken you,\n\n1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:53.680\n not like being physically weak.\n\n1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:55.280\n Sure, you could call that weakness,\n\n1:53:55.280 --> 1:53:57.680\n but maybe you're not meant to be a super strong guy.\n\n1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:02.360\n But choosing to be weak is really a different story\n\n1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:03.200\n other than just like,\n\n1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:07.360\n we're all deficient in some way or another.\n\n1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:10.400\n So that's neither here nor there.\n\n1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:12.120\n It's a matter of what you decide to do with it.\n\n1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:13.640\n And that's different from strength and weakness,\n\n1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:14.800\n at least the way I look at it.\n\n1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:16.440\n Like strength is choosing,\n\n1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:19.720\n regardless of the difficulty, to make improvements.\n\n1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:23.200\n Strength is even choosing to acknowledge that you do lack.\n\n1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:27.480\n And accept it and then make a decision what to do with it.\n\n1:54:28.760 --> 1:54:30.760\n Yeah, but there's also, there's a bunch of stuff\n\n1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:32.560\n that just like you said, it's what you're drawn to.\n\n1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:34.960\n There's an honesty to just grappling\n\n1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:38.280\n that it seems more real than anything else you can do.\n\n1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:39.120\n Sure, well and also.\n\n1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:41.160\n And that's where the passion and love can come from.\n\n1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:43.920\n Yeah, I mean, being in an environment, hopefully,\n\n1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:47.680\n that is as true as possible, would be a starter.\n\n1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:52.360\n So, it's hard to be a bullshit person\n\n1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:55.520\n when you're literally trying to tear each other's arms off.\n\n1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:56.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:58.840\n You know, you really sort of see who somebody is.\n\n1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:01.520\n I also feel like you really get to see somebody who,\n\n1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:03.160\n there are a couple instances where you really see\n\n1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:07.040\n who people are on the mats and in the bedroom.\n\n1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:12.040\n So, even the aspect of self betterment,\n\n1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:19.000\n growth along a path.\n\n1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:23.720\n I mean, hell, that's part of the divisive capture\n\n1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:26.440\n for martial arts as a business.\n\n1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:29.000\n Give you a belt, put a stripe on your belt.\n\n1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.560\n Each of these iterations cost 20 bucks.\n\n1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:33.400\n So, you know.\n\n1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:35.400\n But there's a benefit to that too.\n\n1:55:35.400 --> 1:55:38.200\n I really enjoyed the progression of belts.\n\n1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:39.040\n Sure.\n\n1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:41.360\n You know, a bit of it is OCD or whatever,\n\n1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:44.280\n but you're enjoying the recognition, your growth\n\n1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:46.440\n when you feel, when you're made to feel,\n\n1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:48.840\n when I think genuinely you do earn it.\n\n1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:49.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:55:49.680 --> 1:55:50.500\n I agree.\n\n1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:51.340\n I agree.\n\n1:55:51.340 --> 1:55:52.900\n It makes complete sense to me.\n\n1:55:52.900 --> 1:55:56.860\n It just, it's anything that is, has a goodness\n\n1:55:56.860 --> 1:56:00.560\n in its purity can also have a detriment in its perversion.\n\n1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:01.400\n So.\n\n1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:04.340\n And there's a value to competition.\n\n1:56:04.340 --> 1:56:06.320\n I've gotten some shit in the past for saying this.\n\n1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:11.320\n I've gotten the most value in giving everything I have\n\n1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:15.900\n to try to win and lose.\n\n1:56:15.900 --> 1:56:18.700\n So like, I've gotten, I remember most of the matches\n\n1:56:18.700 --> 1:56:23.560\n I've lost and I think that's what I've gotten the most\n\n1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:25.160\n from the sport is losing.\n\n1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:26.000\n Think about it.\n\n1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:27.600\n I mean, if you really think about it,\n\n1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:34.120\n what makes you wanna actually, in detail,\n\n1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:36.940\n go over what happened?\n\n1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:39.000\n Oh, it's the time when you didn't get what you wanted.\n\n1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:39.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:41.580\n It's a time when you gave it everything you had\n\n1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:42.880\n and you came up short.\n\n1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:43.720\n Right.\n\n1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:45.360\n Or failed miserably.\n\n1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:46.200\n Okay, so.\n\n1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:47.840\n Especially if you're embarrassed in some way.\n\n1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:48.680\n Right.\n\n1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:52.040\n It's usually the only time people, again, calamity,\n\n1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:54.040\n is the impetus for them to actually turn around\n\n1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:55.760\n and go, who the fuck am I?\n\n1:56:55.760 --> 1:56:57.760\n What am I doing and why am I doing it?\n\n1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:02.380\n Instead of naturally going, hmm, okay, well I won.\n\n1:57:02.380 --> 1:57:03.300\n Why?\n\n1:57:03.300 --> 1:57:04.140\n What was it the cause?\n\n1:57:04.140 --> 1:57:08.720\n And so I think part of my success is that when I win,\n\n1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:09.840\n I'm brutal.\n\n1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:11.880\n When I lose, I'm brutal.\n\n1:57:11.880 --> 1:57:13.760\n And there is no in between.\n\n1:57:13.760 --> 1:57:18.760\n So I remember losing the rematch against Noguera.\n\n1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:24.360\n And I still feel like it was a bullshit call.\n\n1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:25.560\n I feel like I won that fight.\n\n1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:30.320\n But my opinion is that, and this even came up,\n\n1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:32.960\n so one of the coaches in the back was like,\n\n1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:35.920\n oh, you did great, don't feel bad, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:36.880\n And I go, no, fuck that.\n\n1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:38.000\n I didn't finish him.\n\n1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:39.920\n I allowed the referees to make a judge,\n\n1:57:39.920 --> 1:57:42.360\n a decision that I think is incorrect and bad,\n\n1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:44.920\n but that came because I didn't take him out.\n\n1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:46.560\n Fuck that, no, no.\n\n1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:48.360\n He won, he's gonna get more money,\n\n1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:49.680\n he's gonna get more recognition,\n\n1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:51.080\n blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:57:51.080 --> 1:57:53.480\n I accept all this and it's not okay.\n\n1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:57.160\n And I need to, when I get a chance to fight him again,\n\n1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:00.320\n I gotta figure out how to take this guy out.\n\n1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:01.520\n I don't wanna say forever.\n\n1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:03.040\n I'm not trying to put him six feet underground.\n\n1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:04.620\n Well, when I fight, yes I am.\n\n1:58:04.620 --> 1:58:09.000\n But the point being, I need to find a way to,\n\n1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:10.640\n this is definitive.\n\n1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.640\n You don't get to say shit about it\n\n1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:15.080\n because I'm the only one who can stand right now.\n\n1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:16.480\n That's the way it's gotta be.\n\n1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:19.740\n Anything less than that is not good enough.\n\n1:58:19.740 --> 1:58:22.880\n And even if I achieve that, then I gotta figure out,\n\n1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:25.300\n okay, it's not a given.\n\n1:58:25.300 --> 1:58:26.560\n How did I get to this point?\n\n1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:27.920\n How did I make that happen?\n\n1:58:28.800 --> 1:58:32.680\n Was it simply because of his own mistakes\n\n1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:36.960\n or was it because of my successful action?\n\n1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:38.680\n So it's always self critical.\n\n1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:40.480\n Always, constantly.\n\n1:58:40.480 --> 1:58:42.480\n You love movies.\n\n1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:44.000\n I read this somewhere.\n\n1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:45.720\n You mentioned Blade Runner is a favorite.\n\n1:58:45.720 --> 1:58:47.520\n Number one of all time, the final cut.\n\n1:58:47.520 --> 1:58:48.760\n That's my go to.\n\n1:58:48.760 --> 1:58:51.560\n So you would say Blade Runner\n\n1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:52.800\n is the greatest movie of all time.\n\n1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:54.840\n It's one of the greatest movies of all time.\n\n1:58:54.840 --> 1:58:55.760\n And it is my number.\n\n1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:56.840\n What's in the top?\n\n1:58:56.840 --> 1:59:01.400\n My top five, Blade Runner, final cut.\n\n1:59:01.400 --> 1:59:03.240\n This is the original Blade Runner.\n\n1:59:03.240 --> 1:59:06.920\n And I used to own, on tape, the original.\n\n1:59:06.920 --> 1:59:07.760\n VHS?\n\n1:59:07.760 --> 1:59:08.920\n The original cut, yeah.\n\n1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:11.800\n And I had the director's cut on DVD.\n\n1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:13.360\n Why Blade Runner, by the way?\n\n1:59:14.600 --> 1:59:15.440\n What connects you to it?\n\n1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:17.120\n As a kid, I just thought it was so cool.\n\n1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:18.620\n There was something about it that really spoke to me.\n\n1:59:18.620 --> 1:59:20.160\n The whole cyberpunk landscapes\n\n1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:25.160\n and this guy chasing down rogue androids, replicants,\n\n1:59:26.420 --> 1:59:27.840\n and all this.\n\n1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:31.200\n Is it just the entire cyberpunk universe\n\n1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:33.000\n or is it just robots as well?\n\n1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:37.000\n No, I mean, the cyberpunk universe is part of it.\n\n1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:40.720\n On the surface, I've always tended towards\n\n1:59:40.720 --> 1:59:42.680\n dark subject matter.\n\n1:59:42.680 --> 1:59:45.560\n Things that are of the dark, so to speak,\n\n1:59:45.560 --> 1:59:48.560\n are things that I've always been gravitated towards.\n\n1:59:48.560 --> 1:59:51.600\n I think maybe part of it is that things that are darker\n\n1:59:51.600 --> 1:59:56.600\n are more accepting and more upfront with death.\n\n2:00:00.200 --> 2:00:03.000\n And perhaps, I think, maybe that is what was...\n\n2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:04.480\n Yeah, somehow more honest, perhaps.\n\n2:00:04.480 --> 2:00:08.760\n I mean, there's also the aspect of rebelliousness, usually.\n\n2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:13.760\n Like, I was never one to wanna just do\n\n2:00:14.680 --> 2:00:17.520\n what somebody told me to do, you know?\n\n2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:22.420\n I'm not sitting around trying to always be\n\n2:00:22.420 --> 2:00:25.360\n such a radical individual that I can't take orders.\n\n2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:28.440\n No, in fact, I'm more than willing to take orders\n\n2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:32.860\n from somebody that I feel is competent and has merit\n\n2:00:32.860 --> 2:00:34.680\n and reason behind what they're doing\n\n2:00:34.680 --> 2:00:36.280\n and makes like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:37.320\n I'm 100% for it.\n\n2:00:37.320 --> 2:00:38.680\n Not only can I take orders,\n\n2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:40.620\n I will help you achieve whatever it is\n\n2:00:40.620 --> 2:00:45.620\n if I think it's worthwhile, even at my own expense.\n\n2:00:45.940 --> 2:00:49.440\n But to get to that point is a rarity.\n\n2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:51.240\n Like, it's just not a given.\n\n2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:54.080\n And so you can even imagine being a grade school teacher\n\n2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:55.280\n and this kid doesn't respect you\n\n2:00:55.280 --> 2:00:57.880\n and he doesn't really think you're that smart.\n\n2:00:57.880 --> 2:01:00.160\n They don't really appreciate that.\n\n2:01:00.160 --> 2:01:01.640\n So cyberpunk is number one.\n\n2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:02.480\n What else is there?\n\n2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:03.320\n Cyberpunk is kind of number one.\n\n2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:05.520\n It's an environment I love, but at the same time,\n\n2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:07.160\n Conan the Barbarian by John Milius\n\n2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:09.360\n is one of my favorite films of all time.\n\n2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:15.360\n And you know, that's such a pure film in a way.\n\n2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:17.080\n Like, the motivations are pure.\n\n2:01:17.080 --> 2:01:22.080\n They're very easy to follow, but not lacking in depth.\n\n2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:28.080\n You know, it's not just explosions and teal and orange.\n\n2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:33.080\n It's more on the human condition and I love it.\n\n2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:36.360\n And it's shot incredibly well.\n\n2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:38.280\n It's got an incredible soundtrack.\n\n2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:39.840\n Yeah, I fucking love it.\n\n2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:41.680\n But with Blade Runner also in a deeper sense,\n\n2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:43.320\n you know, again, the human condition.\n\n2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:45.800\n You know, you start seeing like, what is being?\n\n2:01:45.800 --> 2:01:47.640\n What is being human?\n\n2:01:47.640 --> 2:01:51.320\n You know, how does this relate to if you can make it\n\n2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:52.880\n and you can tell it what to do,\n\n2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:56.520\n at what point is it like you should or you shouldn't?\n\n2:01:56.520 --> 2:01:58.920\n You know, why do you get to determine what's alive\n\n2:01:58.920 --> 2:01:59.760\n and what's not?\n\n2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:02.680\n What's a life that should be allowed to live and what isn't?\n\n2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:07.680\n And what would be the strain of being Roy Batty\n\n2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:12.240\n and seeing all these incredible moments\n\n2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:17.120\n that with his passing will no longer exist?\n\n2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:18.920\n Especially if he hasn't had a chance\n\n2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:22.640\n to put that flame into another torch, so to speak.\n\n2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:23.920\n If he hasn't written them down,\n\n2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:26.680\n if he hasn't passed them down to somebody else.\n\n2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:30.320\n Gone like tears in the rain.\n\n2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:33.200\n Like tears in the rain, that scene is incredible.\n\n2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:35.120\n But it's funny, because those two universes\n\n2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:38.000\n are very different, Conan and the Barbarian and Cyberpunk.\n\n2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.120\n Is there, that makes me curious about\n\n2:02:40.120 --> 2:02:43.480\n what else might be in the list at the top.\n\n2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:44.320\n Well, let me think.\n\n2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:45.280\n It's a pretty.\n\n2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:47.640\n Do you like the Godfather type of universe?\n\n2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:49.360\n No, no, I mean, I'm sure the Godfather,\n\n2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:51.240\n I've never actually even watched the whole Godfather.\n\n2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:54.600\n No, but also like, was it Casino, Goodfellas?\n\n2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:56.960\n Goodfellas is a good movie, but no, that's not in my top.\n\n2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:00.360\n It's a good flick, but it doesn't really do it for me.\n\n2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:03.440\n If people really wanna get into this a little more,\n\n2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:07.200\n I did make a list of 100 of my favorite movies\n\n2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:08.520\n on my Facebook fan page.\n\n2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:09.360\n Nice.\n\n2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:12.160\n Do you remember what like, some of the top.\n\n2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:14.240\n Oh yeah, like Blazing Saddles is on there,\n\n2:03:14.240 --> 2:03:15.700\n Rage of the Lost Ark,\n\n2:03:15.700 --> 2:03:20.700\n Valhalla Rising by Nicholas from Winding Refn,\n\n2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:25.700\n Maniac by William Lustig.\n\n2:03:25.700 --> 2:03:30.700\n It's a 1980 gnarly video nasty horror movie\n\n2:03:31.740 --> 2:03:36.740\n about a serial killer who murders women and scalps them.\n\n2:03:38.220 --> 2:03:41.580\n And it's gnarly as hell and very brutal and very bleak\n\n2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:46.580\n and very, I mean, it's the kind of thing\n\n2:03:46.660 --> 2:03:47.740\n that like a lot of people would have\n\n2:03:47.740 --> 2:03:49.340\n a real hard time watching.\n\n2:03:49.340 --> 2:03:53.100\n But one, again, I like things that are dark,\n\n2:03:53.100 --> 2:03:56.600\n but two, I thought the performances were fantastic\n\n2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:58.740\n in this film and they really got out,\n\n2:03:58.740 --> 2:04:00.300\n I think what the underlying thing was,\n\n2:04:00.300 --> 2:04:05.300\n and it was a guy who was basically just like run amok\n\n2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:08.620\n by the overbearing mother, Jungian archetype.\n\n2:04:08.620 --> 2:04:13.380\n And it, she was, she imparted her insanity into him.\n\n2:04:13.380 --> 2:04:17.140\n And he, but yet there is this aspect you could see\n\n2:04:17.140 --> 2:04:19.580\n of him wanting to try and actually be able\n\n2:04:19.580 --> 2:04:22.820\n to be in the world and have love\n\n2:04:22.820 --> 2:04:27.820\n and have a feminine companionship\n\n2:04:28.380 --> 2:04:31.640\n to go with his masculine aspect.\n\n2:04:31.640 --> 2:04:34.580\n But he had no way of understanding\n\n2:04:34.580 --> 2:04:36.420\n how to really make that happen.\n\n2:04:36.420 --> 2:04:40.220\n And he had a complete negative connotation to the feminine.\n\n2:04:40.220 --> 2:04:44.860\n So his struggle with, and there's a little part\n\n2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:48.660\n in the movie where he somehow comes across\n\n2:04:48.660 --> 2:04:52.860\n this model or something, and they actually,\n\n2:04:52.860 --> 2:04:56.020\n he starts to feel like maybe he might be able\n\n2:04:56.020 --> 2:04:58.860\n to actually have a relationship with somebody\n\n2:04:58.860 --> 2:04:59.700\n and it goes somewhere.\n\n2:04:59.700 --> 2:05:04.140\n But yeah, even the Elijah Wood remake I felt was\n\n2:05:04.140 --> 2:05:06.300\n really well done and captured most of the essence\n\n2:05:06.300 --> 2:05:07.380\n of what the movie was about.\n\n2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:09.540\n But I still feel like the original\n\n2:05:09.540 --> 2:05:12.540\n by William Lustig is the best.\n\n2:05:12.540 --> 2:05:16.860\n What's the greatest love movie of all time?\n\n2:05:16.860 --> 2:05:18.860\n Greatest love movie of all time.\n\n2:05:18.860 --> 2:05:20.460\n So like something where love is, I mean,\n\n2:05:20.460 --> 2:05:22.780\n I suppose love underlies most of these movies,\n\n2:05:22.780 --> 2:05:23.980\n and especially like The Dark.\n\n2:05:23.980 --> 2:05:27.940\n I mean hell, Takashi Miike's films are all about family\n\n2:05:27.940 --> 2:05:30.620\n of all things, as bonkers as those movies are.\n\n2:05:30.620 --> 2:05:34.660\n They, the general theme is family almost entirely\n\n2:05:34.660 --> 2:05:36.980\n in all of his films.\n\n2:05:36.980 --> 2:05:39.820\n Yeah, there's very, I mean, even you can argue later on.\n\n2:05:39.820 --> 2:05:41.300\n Yeah, it's everywhere.\n\n2:05:41.300 --> 2:05:43.140\n Greatest love film of all time.\n\n2:05:45.660 --> 2:05:48.660\n That's, I mean, is Excalibur a film about love?\n\n2:05:49.740 --> 2:05:51.340\n What's Excalibur about?\n\n2:05:51.340 --> 2:05:52.180\n King Arthur.\n\n2:05:53.060 --> 2:05:57.740\n Excalibur is about Arthur becoming king of the Britains\n\n2:05:57.740 --> 2:06:01.540\n and his love of his country and his love of Guinevere.\n\n2:06:01.540 --> 2:06:04.740\n But eventually, yeah, it becomes more of about\n\n2:06:06.860 --> 2:06:10.940\n the necessity for the king to love,\n\n2:06:10.940 --> 2:06:15.940\n to hold Excalibur, to stay, to realize that while,\n\n2:06:16.980 --> 2:06:19.660\n if you're the king, you can love your wife\n\n2:06:19.660 --> 2:06:21.380\n and you can love your best friend,\n\n2:06:21.380 --> 2:06:25.900\n and they may fuck each other behind your back\n\n2:06:25.900 --> 2:06:27.820\n and as they fall in love too.\n\n2:06:27.820 --> 2:06:29.540\n But at the end of the day, your responsibility,\n\n2:06:29.540 --> 2:06:33.340\n your love has to be to the country and everyone else first\n\n2:06:33.340 --> 2:06:36.620\n and not your own personal wants,\n\n2:06:36.620 --> 2:06:40.340\n which, you know, made a much more interesting story\n\n2:06:40.340 --> 2:06:45.340\n when you have Carmen Berenna and oh, oh, what is that one?\n\n2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:50.540\n It's a German opera, but you know, and horses and slow mo\n\n2:06:50.540 --> 2:06:53.380\n and sword fights and an epic death scene\n\n2:06:53.380 --> 2:06:56.860\n between Arthur and his son.\n\n2:06:56.860 --> 2:06:58.220\n Okay, now I definitely have to watch it\n\n2:06:58.220 --> 2:07:01.060\n and Evan watched it and embarrassed me.\n\n2:07:01.060 --> 2:07:05.300\n It is John Boorman's second film in Hollywood,\n\n2:07:05.300 --> 2:07:07.420\n his first one being Point Blank with Lee Marvin,\n\n2:07:07.420 --> 2:07:10.460\n which is also on top, one of the upper echelon movies\n\n2:07:10.460 --> 2:07:15.460\n on my list, derived from a book called The Outfit by,\n\n2:07:19.180 --> 2:07:20.380\n what is his name?\n\n2:07:21.660 --> 2:07:25.220\n I forget, but Darwin Cook, the comic illustrator,\n\n2:07:25.220 --> 2:07:28.780\n Donald Westlake wrote, so Darwin Cook does an amazing\n\n2:07:28.780 --> 2:07:31.240\n comic book send up of Darwin Cook's novels\n\n2:07:31.240 --> 2:07:33.820\n and they are fucking incredible.\n\n2:07:33.820 --> 2:07:37.720\n So anyways, but the Point Blank with Lee Marvin,\n\n2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:43.180\n you know, it's a man driven by purpose, revenge,\n\n2:07:43.180 --> 2:07:46.620\n but also by like really pure motivations.\n\n2:07:46.620 --> 2:07:51.620\n He wants his money, he was betrayed and he wants his cash\n\n2:07:52.500 --> 2:07:54.500\n because this is what he agreed to do the thing for\n\n2:07:54.500 --> 2:07:56.780\n and this is, which also is part of the reason\n\n2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:58.540\n why I like No Country for Old Men so much,\n\n2:07:58.540 --> 2:08:02.100\n which I felt was a great movie, even better book,\n\n2:08:02.100 --> 2:08:04.220\n but I remember talking to my friend and I go,\n\n2:08:04.220 --> 2:08:08.760\n you know, Anton Chigurh is the most pure human being\n\n2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:09.940\n in that whole book.\n\n2:08:09.940 --> 2:08:11.140\n Well, that guy's the villain.\n\n2:08:11.140 --> 2:08:13.540\n I go, ha ha, is he evil?\n\n2:08:14.940 --> 2:08:17.260\n He's the one, he lies to no one.\n\n2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:19.300\n He does everything he says he will do.\n\n2:08:19.300 --> 2:08:22.380\n He always follows his word and on the rare occasion,\n\n2:08:22.380 --> 2:08:25.740\n he allows fate to make a decision as he figures like,\n\n2:08:25.740 --> 2:08:29.260\n well, whatever all led us to here will lead us\n\n2:08:29.260 --> 2:08:32.100\n one way or the other and if we're at this crossroads,\n\n2:08:32.100 --> 2:08:34.700\n what, how is there any better or worse way\n\n2:08:34.700 --> 2:08:36.500\n than to do it over a coin flip?\n\n2:08:36.500 --> 2:08:39.540\n And so that whole scene where the guy's going,\n\n2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:40.940\n well, what am I putting up?\n\n2:08:40.940 --> 2:08:43.020\n And he goes, everything, you've been putting it up\n\n2:08:43.020 --> 2:08:45.980\n every day of your life and that's true.\n\n2:08:45.980 --> 2:08:50.940\n Everything we do is a decision, is a calling, is a choice.\n\n2:08:50.940 --> 2:08:55.740\n And then it bummed me out that they reduced\n\n2:08:55.740 --> 2:08:57.380\n the last interaction between Chigurh\n\n2:08:57.380 --> 2:09:01.980\n and What's His Face's wife and he finally finds her\n\n2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:03.540\n and she's like, you don't have to do this.\n\n2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:05.580\n I mean, he's like, yes, yes, I do.\n\n2:09:05.580 --> 2:09:06.740\n This is the way it is.\n\n2:09:06.740 --> 2:09:08.220\n You can think that your life could've turned out\n\n2:09:08.220 --> 2:09:09.820\n any sort of way, you could've done this,\n\n2:09:09.820 --> 2:09:11.100\n you could've done that, but the reality is\n\n2:09:11.100 --> 2:09:11.940\n this is the way your life is\n\n2:09:11.940 --> 2:09:14.260\n and it's the way it was always going to be.\n\n2:09:14.260 --> 2:09:17.060\n You know, the fact that I'm here is the end of it\n\n2:09:17.060 --> 2:09:18.580\n and that's that.\n\n2:09:18.580 --> 2:09:21.540\n Yeah, it's funny, if you're honest, this with dark movies\n\n2:09:21.540 --> 2:09:26.540\n reveal that the villains are the purest of humans\n\n2:09:26.980 --> 2:09:30.300\n and can teach us the most profound lessons\n\n2:09:30.300 --> 2:09:32.540\n and that's certainly an example of it.\n\n2:09:32.540 --> 2:09:34.780\n What do you think the big ridiculous\n\n2:09:34.780 --> 2:09:36.700\n last philosophical question, what do you think\n\n2:09:36.700 --> 2:09:39.940\n is the meaning of this whole thing we've got going on\n\n2:09:39.940 --> 2:09:42.940\n of life and existence on Earth from your individual\n\n2:09:42.940 --> 2:09:45.580\n perspective but the entirety of the human species?\n\n2:09:45.580 --> 2:09:48.620\n Life, the universe and everything?\n\n2:09:48.620 --> 2:09:49.460\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:50.620 --> 2:09:51.460\n Don't.\n\n2:09:51.460 --> 2:09:52.300\n Oh.\n\n2:09:56.940 --> 2:09:58.140\n We could just leave it at that.\n\n2:09:58.140 --> 2:09:59.820\n You knew exactly where I was going.\n\n2:09:59.820 --> 2:10:00.660\n I love it.\n\n2:10:00.660 --> 2:10:01.660\n Josh, I love you very much.\n\n2:10:01.660 --> 2:10:03.260\n You've been a huge inspiration.\n\n2:10:03.260 --> 2:10:07.020\n I have a friend who she said,\n\n2:10:07.020 --> 2:10:08.260\n do you know Lex Friedman?\n\n2:10:08.260 --> 2:10:09.580\n Have you gone on Lex's content?\n\n2:10:09.580 --> 2:10:11.860\n And I go, yes, I know Lex Friedman is.\n\n2:10:11.860 --> 2:10:15.420\n I've sadly been way too long in contact\n\n2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:17.740\n without making it happen for too long\n\n2:10:17.740 --> 2:10:21.740\n and yes, I will 100%, I even cut a shirt\n\n2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:23.100\n at the beginning of the pandemic\n\n2:10:23.100 --> 2:10:25.100\n to make my own little mask at one point\n\n2:10:25.100 --> 2:10:30.100\n due to the Lex process and hello, I was like,\n\n2:10:30.220 --> 2:10:32.380\n I can't really hear you but I'm demonstrating.\n\n2:10:33.940 --> 2:10:36.340\n Just let's see it through but this has been a blast.\n\n2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:39.500\n And next time, next time let's drink\n\n2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:41.020\n some of the Warbringer whiskey.\n\n2:10:41.020 --> 2:10:43.220\n I will bring some Warmaster.\n\n2:10:43.220 --> 2:10:47.780\n I wasn't sure if you were, if you imbibed at all in spirits.\n\n2:10:47.780 --> 2:10:51.540\n 100%, it felt a little weird to do it early on\n\n2:10:51.540 --> 2:10:54.060\n in the morning, especially because I'm flying out there.\n\n2:10:54.060 --> 2:10:54.900\n Does it though?\n\n2:10:54.900 --> 2:10:57.660\n I mean, I've had some wonderful morning whiskey at times.\n\n2:10:57.660 --> 2:11:00.940\n It, now that you've mentioned it, it doesn't at all.\n\n2:11:00.940 --> 2:11:03.900\n So next time let's make sure what Joe Organ calls\n\n2:11:03.900 --> 2:11:08.620\n the adult beverages, let's make sure we indulge.\n\n2:11:08.620 --> 2:11:11.220\n I have zero reservations for doing such a thing.\n\n2:11:11.220 --> 2:11:12.500\n I'm into it.\n\n2:11:12.500 --> 2:11:14.020\n Josh, thanks for talking to me.\n\n2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:14.860\n My pleasure.\n\n2:11:15.860 --> 2:11:17.420\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:11:17.420 --> 2:11:20.820\n with Josh Barnett and thank you to our

enemy\n\n2:11:42.780 --> 2:11:44.540\n without fighting.\n\n2:11:44.540 --> 2:12:09.540\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
