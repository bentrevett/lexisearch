00:10.700\n philosopher, Kung Fu scholar, and the mastermind\n\n00:10.700 --> 00:14.880\n of the legendary hip hop group Wu Tang Clan.\n\n00:14.880 --> 00:17.260\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:17.260 --> 00:19.260\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:19.260 --> 00:20.460\n in the description.\n\n00:20.460 --> 00:23.620\n And now, here's my conversation with RZA.\n\n00:24.860 --> 00:27.140\n In the Tao of Wu, you write,\n\n00:27.140 --> 00:30.100\n when my mother left the physical world, I lost one\n\n00:30.100 --> 00:32.460\n of my main links to the universe.\n\n00:32.460 --> 00:35.180\n They say that you have an umbilical cord\n\n00:35.180 --> 00:38.140\n and an etheric cord, which is the invisible cord\n\n00:38.140 --> 00:41.300\n that attaches you to your soul, your mother's soul\n\n00:41.300 --> 00:43.180\n and all other souls.\n\n00:43.180 --> 00:46.420\n When one passes away, you really lose something.\n\n00:46.420 --> 00:48.260\n It's physical and mental.\n\n00:48.260 --> 00:49.460\n It's real.\n\n00:49.460 --> 00:50.620\n Part of you dies.\n\n00:52.420 --> 00:54.860\n What have you learned about life from your mother?\n\n00:54.860 --> 00:58.860\n I mean, I learned life itself from my mother.\n\n01:00.180 --> 01:03.700\n You know, being one of 11 children\n\n01:05.040 --> 01:10.040\n and seeing the sacrifice that she gave to us,\n\n01:10.340 --> 01:12.160\n therefore given to life.\n\n01:13.340 --> 01:15.520\n It's really the greatest lesson of life.\n\n01:16.760 --> 01:21.340\n The thing that shook me as I wrote those words\n\n01:21.340 --> 01:26.340\n was coming up young with arrogance, confidence,\n\n01:31.620 --> 01:33.240\n knowledge of myself.\n\n01:34.220 --> 01:35.980\n They called me the scientist.\n\n01:36.980 --> 01:40.300\n We was taught you're the supreme being.\n\n01:40.300 --> 01:41.700\n In order to be the supreme being,\n\n01:41.700 --> 01:44.720\n you gotta be supreme amongst other beings.\n\n01:47.140 --> 01:50.100\n I understand that more now than I did then\n\n01:50.100 --> 01:52.040\n because then it was so literal.\n\n01:53.100 --> 01:57.260\n You know, the word God derived basically\n\n01:57.260 --> 01:58.860\n from the Greek language, as they say,\n\n01:58.860 --> 02:01.940\n and it meant wisdom, strength and beauty.\n\n02:03.660 --> 02:06.140\n Yeah, we could have that.\n\n02:06.140 --> 02:08.740\n But the power to control life and death\n\n02:09.740 --> 02:14.240\n is something that you would assume is a God trait.\n\n02:14.240 --> 02:19.240\n So now here you are saying that you're a God, right?\n\n02:20.120 --> 02:21.380\n And you're reading the Bible,\n\n02:21.380 --> 02:23.600\n how Jesus brought back Lazarus.\n\n02:24.440 --> 02:27.400\n And you know, now it's your turn to do something.\n\n02:28.320 --> 02:31.480\n And when my mother was laying there in the hospital bed\n\n02:32.320 --> 02:34.800\n and air was no longer coming out of her lungs\n\n02:34.800 --> 02:36.240\n and going into her lungs,\n\n02:37.640 --> 02:39.900\n where's my power to bring her back to life?\n\n02:39.900 --> 02:44.700\n Yeah, so you can't truly be God.\n\n02:44.700 --> 02:46.340\n You're powerless.\n\n02:46.340 --> 02:48.940\n Yeah, or God is not the definition\n\n02:48.940 --> 02:50.700\n that we need to use to describe it\n\n02:51.580 --> 02:54.660\n because it's a translation of wisdom, strength and beauty.\n\n02:54.660 --> 02:56.340\n So you could be that.\n\n02:56.340 --> 02:58.520\n But so I'm answering your question,\n\n02:58.520 --> 03:00.020\n what did my mother teach me about life?\n\n03:00.020 --> 03:02.860\n I learned that day on her physical passing,\n\n03:03.740 --> 03:07.800\n that okay, you know what I mean, there's a physical me.\n\n03:07.800 --> 03:12.100\n Do you think about her, do you miss her?\n\n03:12.100 --> 03:16.560\n Of course, I keep my mother in my prayer every day.\n\n03:17.800 --> 03:22.800\n And the thing I pray the most beyond giving thanks\n\n03:23.460 --> 03:27.420\n is I pray that her name is honored\n\n03:27.420 --> 03:29.240\n and remembered by my family.\n\n03:30.300 --> 03:33.660\n I don't know if the world's gonna remember that, right?\n\n03:33.660 --> 03:36.000\n Even though if you watch my movie, Love Beats Rhymes,\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.060\n I named the school in that movie after my mother\n\n03:39.060 --> 03:41.700\n just to leave it somewhere else.\n\n03:41.700 --> 03:43.940\n Yeah, in physical space.\n\n03:43.940 --> 03:45.140\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n03:45.140 --> 03:47.720\n But yeah, painful.\n\n03:47.720 --> 03:51.880\n The pain of my mother's passing is indescribable.\n\n03:51.880 --> 03:55.380\n Only until it happens to a person they know\n\n03:55.380 --> 03:56.880\n and then they won't describe it either.\n\n03:56.880 --> 03:58.540\n Only the people that lost their mother,\n\n03:58.540 --> 04:00.820\n they could look at each other and they got this nod.\n\n04:00.820 --> 04:01.820\n You know what I mean?\n\n04:01.820 --> 04:06.820\n But one other thing happened to me was the joy of life\n\n04:07.580 --> 04:08.620\n hit me differently.\n\n04:10.860 --> 04:15.860\n And I think it was the realization of my own mortality\n\n04:17.860 --> 04:19.760\n versus my immortality.\n\n04:21.340 --> 04:22.620\n It's a big, big thing.\n\n04:22.620 --> 04:25.060\n And I don't know if we'll get to expound on that,\n\n04:25.060 --> 04:26.740\n but there was a joy that overcame me\n\n04:26.740 --> 04:30.420\n because I was kind of free of a certain illusion\n\n04:30.420 --> 04:34.340\n about the immortality of my physical being\n\n04:35.380 --> 04:39.100\n versus the mortality of my physical being.\n\n04:39.100 --> 04:42.180\n And I was like, okay, wow, I understand.\n\n04:42.180 --> 04:45.860\n So that was the first or the hardest realization\n\n04:45.860 --> 04:47.820\n you've experienced that you're mortal.\n\n04:48.740 --> 04:49.660\n Yeah, that, yeah.\n\n04:49.660 --> 04:53.580\n And I'll say mortal and what you're looking at here\n\n04:53.580 --> 04:58.180\n physically, I won't say my soul is mortal.\n\n04:58.180 --> 05:01.200\n I'll say it's immortal because at the end of the day,\n\n05:02.220 --> 05:05.840\n it's just like I can sit here and I could just hum,\n\n05:05.840 --> 05:10.180\n please, please, please, by James Brown.\n\n05:10.180 --> 05:14.500\n But James Brown is not gonna come in here and do that.\n\n05:16.460 --> 05:18.380\n So in some sense, James Brown is still here.\n\n05:18.380 --> 05:19.220\n In another sense, he's gone.\n\n05:19.220 --> 05:20.420\n His soul is here.\n\n05:20.420 --> 05:22.420\n His soul is here.\n\n05:22.420 --> 05:25.580\n Well, it lives through you by you singing it.\n\n05:25.580 --> 05:28.820\n It lives through you by you listening to it, celebrating it.\n\n05:28.820 --> 05:32.500\n And the hope is that the human species continues\n\n05:32.500 --> 05:34.900\n to celebrate the great minds\n\n05:34.900 --> 05:36.880\n and the great creations of the past.\n\n05:36.880 --> 05:38.580\n I will add this to that equation.\n\n05:41.460 --> 05:43.040\n When I say it's immortal,\n\n05:44.280 --> 05:45.860\n I don't think it's not just only\n\n05:45.860 --> 05:48.340\n because somebody sings it, right?\n\n05:48.340 --> 05:50.980\n It's like, where's the fire at right now?\n\n05:52.600 --> 05:54.100\n It's in the air.\n\n05:54.100 --> 05:56.260\n You just gotta spark the spark.\n\n05:56.260 --> 05:58.820\n Yeah.\n\n05:58.820 --> 06:00.180\n So it's always there.\n\n06:01.620 --> 06:03.300\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n06:03.300 --> 06:05.660\n Nah, I'm not afraid of death.\n\n06:05.660 --> 06:07.220\n I'm not trying to see it.\n\n06:08.380 --> 06:10.840\n I'm not watching that nowhere near me, right?\n\n06:10.840 --> 06:12.940\n Because all I know is life, right?\n\n06:12.940 --> 06:14.120\n My life is living.\n\n06:15.880 --> 06:17.460\n I read a lot of ancient texts,\n\n06:17.460 --> 06:19.420\n people probably know about me.\n\n06:19.420 --> 06:21.980\n I love one of the great teachers named Bodhidharma.\n\n06:21.980 --> 06:26.980\n And there was a thing written in one of the books of his\n\n06:29.700 --> 06:30.900\n or one of the teachings of his.\n\n06:30.900 --> 06:34.900\n And the question, somebody asked him similar question,\n\n06:34.900 --> 06:37.420\n you're scared of death or what are you gonna be\n\n06:37.420 --> 06:39.500\n after you die?\n\n06:39.500 --> 06:41.500\n And his answer was, I don't know.\n\n06:41.500 --> 06:43.800\n He had answers to everything.\n\n06:43.800 --> 06:44.640\n But he was like, I don't know.\n\n06:44.640 --> 06:46.580\n They said, oh, he doesn't know that.\n\n06:46.580 --> 06:48.340\n So yeah, because I haven't died yet.\n\n06:48.340 --> 06:52.100\n Yeah, well, the uncertainty to some people is terrifying.\n\n06:52.100 --> 06:55.060\n Not knowing what's on the other side of the door.\n\n06:55.060 --> 06:56.180\n Yeah.\n\n06:56.180 --> 06:58.140\n I mean, especially when you're young.\n\n06:58.140 --> 07:03.140\n You know, as a kid, fear permeated my life.\n\n07:03.560 --> 07:04.400\n You know what I mean?\n\n07:04.400 --> 07:06.420\n You know, I was actually watching horror movies\n\n07:06.420 --> 07:10.740\n and I believed in all type of supernatural things\n\n07:10.740 --> 07:12.060\n that could or can happen.\n\n07:12.060 --> 07:14.460\n I thought I saw things as well.\n\n07:14.460 --> 07:17.340\n And you know, whether it was being projected\n\n07:17.340 --> 07:19.500\n in my own mind or whether it was there visible to me,\n\n07:19.500 --> 07:20.600\n I don't know, right?\n\n07:22.340 --> 07:27.340\n But life is beautiful and we have it.\n\n07:28.200 --> 07:31.980\n And we should use it all the way to the last drop.\n\n07:32.860 --> 07:36.820\n Realizing the mortality, the gift your mother gave to you\n\n07:36.820 --> 07:38.900\n is realizing the immortal.\n\n07:38.900 --> 07:42.620\n And in so doing, help you realize that life is beautiful.\n\n07:42.620 --> 07:43.820\n Yeah.\n\n07:43.820 --> 07:48.580\n On this topic, Quincy Jones, I read, said to ODB and you,\n\n07:48.580 --> 07:50.340\n when it rains, get wet.\n\n07:51.300 --> 07:52.940\n What do these words mean to you?\n\n07:54.820 --> 07:58.020\n Well, I think what Quincy was saying at that time was,\n\n07:58.020 --> 08:02.100\n you know, I think I was more conservative,\n\n08:02.100 --> 08:03.780\n like as a person.\n\n08:03.780 --> 08:07.280\n And like, you know, I had money.\n\n08:07.280 --> 08:09.060\n Women wanted me.\n\n08:09.060 --> 08:13.740\n Anything I kind of wanted, I probably could have had.\n\n08:13.740 --> 08:15.220\n You know what I mean?\n\n08:15.220 --> 08:17.060\n And he was just saying, when it rains, get wet.\n\n08:17.060 --> 08:18.220\n Enjoy this, man.\n\n08:18.220 --> 08:19.360\n It's raining on you.\n\n08:20.500 --> 08:21.340\n You know what I mean?\n\n08:21.340 --> 08:22.540\n Don't put up the umbrella.\n\n08:22.540 --> 08:24.900\n Don't go back in the house.\n\n08:24.900 --> 08:25.780\n Get wet.\n\n08:25.780 --> 08:27.080\n Experience the moment.\n\n08:27.080 --> 08:28.420\n Yeah, and enjoy it.\n\n08:28.420 --> 08:32.620\n And I didn't take total heed to him at that time.\n\n08:32.620 --> 08:35.300\n A couple of years later, I took some heed.\n\n08:35.300 --> 08:36.940\n But at that time, I didn't take heed.\n\n08:36.940 --> 08:39.400\n And when I took heed,\n\n08:39.400 --> 08:44.400\n I think that I may have misinterpreted\n\n08:46.080 --> 08:48.200\n by looking at his example of getting wet\n\n08:48.200 --> 08:50.120\n versus my example of getting wet.\n\n08:51.040 --> 08:52.520\n And I can tell you right now,\n\n08:52.520 --> 08:56.160\n I'm getting wet right now in my way.\n\n08:56.160 --> 08:57.520\n In part, thanks to your mother.\n\n08:57.520 --> 09:01.600\n But overall, you just learned how to appreciate the rain,\n\n09:01.600 --> 09:04.740\n just like the experience of every moment.\n\n09:04.740 --> 09:05.840\n Yeah, and I'll share this with you\n\n09:05.840 --> 09:08.460\n because this is going to be a very open conversation\n\n09:08.460 --> 09:09.960\n and I haven't had this conversation.\n\n09:09.960 --> 09:12.760\n So definitely in part to my mother,\n\n09:12.760 --> 09:14.060\n then in part to my wife.\n\n09:15.360 --> 09:19.560\n I meet my wife, it's my second wife,\n\n09:19.560 --> 09:22.360\n but I met her after my mother passed.\n\n09:22.360 --> 09:23.920\n And she was just a friend.\n\n09:23.920 --> 09:27.120\n You know, some girl I met, I thought she was beautiful\n\n09:27.120 --> 09:29.320\n and actually built a friendship with her.\n\n09:31.280 --> 09:35.360\n But a few years later, when the relationship became like,\n\n09:35.360 --> 09:37.600\n you know, this is going to be my woman,\n\n09:37.600 --> 09:42.040\n it was actually when I was doing the middle of my divorce\n\n09:42.040 --> 09:45.680\n and I was like, you know, do I run wild and hey, hey, hey,\n\n09:45.680 --> 09:48.880\n you know, me and my wife already filed, we were separated.\n\n09:48.880 --> 09:51.240\n And do I run wild?\n\n09:51.240 --> 09:54.160\n And I didn't run wild, a little bit, but not too wild.\n\n09:55.520 --> 10:00.360\n And you know, I'm still a man, I'm a hip hop guy, so.\n\n10:00.360 --> 10:01.640\n I read you know how to party.\n\n10:01.640 --> 10:02.880\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n10:02.880 --> 10:07.880\n But the funny thing is that my wife now, her name is Talani,\n\n10:08.440 --> 10:13.440\n my uncle said, she reminds me of your mother.\n\n10:15.080 --> 10:17.840\n He knew my mother before I knew my mother.\n\n10:18.920 --> 10:23.920\n And he saw that and we ended up dating, got engaged\n\n10:26.960 --> 10:28.540\n and then her mother passes.\n\n10:28.540 --> 10:33.540\n And so now there's a total understanding of everything.\n\n10:35.680 --> 10:38.600\n And we actually help build each other back up.\n\n10:38.600 --> 10:42.340\n So of course I have to thank my mother for the awareness.\n\n10:43.360 --> 10:47.820\n Then I thank my wife for bringing that awareness\n\n10:47.820 --> 10:52.820\n to actual actualization, like to actually feel,\n\n10:52.880 --> 10:54.560\n I don't think I'll be talking to you right now\n\n10:54.560 --> 10:56.760\n and talking as much as I do these days,\n\n10:56.760 --> 11:00.000\n if it wasn't for the security and peace and harmony\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:05.000\n that I was able to gain at home, you know, so.\n\n11:05.600 --> 11:07.920\n And like you said, you now share that look\n\n11:07.920 --> 11:12.540\n of having both lost your, your mom.\n\n11:13.980 --> 11:16.320\n What have you learned from Quincy about music,\n\n11:16.320 --> 11:17.940\n about business, about life?\n\n11:19.640 --> 11:24.520\n Quincy Jones is a great mind, great artist, you know,\n\n11:24.520 --> 11:27.040\n a treasure in all reality.\n\n11:27.040 --> 11:30.720\n He seen it from when it was, he couldn't walk in this,\n\n11:30.720 --> 11:34.000\n he couldn't eat in the same places he played his music at\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:36.840\n to owning places bigger than ours.\n\n11:36.840 --> 11:38.640\n So what a beautiful life, you know?\n\n11:41.760 --> 11:44.460\n He's the type of guy, if you spend one hour with him,\n\n11:45.640 --> 11:48.840\n you got a lifetime of information.\n\n11:48.840 --> 11:50.960\n And I was blessed to spend multiple hours with him\n\n11:50.960 --> 11:51.800\n and days with him.\n\n11:51.800 --> 11:54.000\n And, you know, there's a certain period of time\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.320\n where we came across each other and he was always\n\n11:58.320 --> 11:59.560\n there to share the knowledge.\n\n11:59.560 --> 12:01.840\n Like that's another thing about him that I think is special.\n\n12:01.840 --> 12:04.960\n And hopefully I picked that up,\n\n12:04.960 --> 12:09.240\n is that he's always willing to share,\n\n12:09.240 --> 12:12.120\n share with his experience, his knowledge.\n\n12:12.120 --> 12:17.120\n I mean, I think he'll even share his home\n\n12:17.460 --> 12:19.920\n to the right person if he feels that that's what they need\n\n12:19.920 --> 12:20.960\n to get back on their feet.\n\n12:20.960 --> 12:22.280\n He's a very beautiful man.\n\n12:22.280 --> 12:26.000\n So just the kindness, the goodness of the man\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:28.820\n is like the thing that really rubbed off on you.\n\n12:28.820 --> 12:31.200\n Yeah, I mean, minimum, right?\n\n12:31.200 --> 12:34.800\n I mean, Quincy Jones also in his fifties,\n\n12:34.800 --> 12:38.600\n as a producer, produced one of the greatest albums\n\n12:38.600 --> 12:41.420\n of all time and one of the greatest selling albums\n\n12:41.420 --> 12:42.260\n of all time.\n\n12:42.260 --> 12:45.740\n Not just great critically, economically great.\n\n12:45.740 --> 12:49.720\n And I mean, I think he did it at the age I am right now.\n\n12:49.720 --> 12:51.520\n So I might have a great year coming up.\n\n12:51.520 --> 12:52.360\n I don't know.\n\n12:52.360 --> 12:53.200\n Yeah.\n\n12:55.200 --> 12:56.360\n Time and well, yeah.\n\n12:57.320 --> 13:00.160\n So now you got a taste of what greatness is.\n\n13:00.160 --> 13:01.680\n You get to see what greatness is.\n\n13:01.680 --> 13:04.680\n So you know what you need to do for yourself.\n\n13:04.680 --> 13:06.660\n Exactly, how to strive for yourself, yeah.\n\n13:06.660 --> 13:08.600\n You have a few people you've worked with\n\n13:08.600 --> 13:10.640\n who are fascinating like yourself.\n\n13:10.640 --> 13:12.920\n Quentin Tarantino, you worked with him.\n\n13:14.040 --> 13:16.360\n When somebody asked you to describe him with one word,\n\n13:16.360 --> 13:18.480\n you said encyclopedia.\n\n13:18.480 --> 13:19.960\n What have you learned from the guy\n\n13:19.960 --> 13:22.720\n about filmmaking and about life again?\n\n13:22.720 --> 13:25.040\n A very generous man with his knowledge.\n\n13:25.040 --> 13:27.840\n And for me, he shared it, I think,\n\n13:27.840 --> 13:30.740\n in a way that was unique in a sense of,\n\n13:31.720 --> 13:34.000\n you know, at a point in time,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.820\n you know, we just was super duper tight.\n\n13:35.820 --> 13:38.200\n Like, you know, like I'm going to this crib\n\n13:38.200 --> 13:42.260\n and watching movies and just having long conversations\n\n13:42.260 --> 13:44.460\n about art and about life.\n\n13:44.460 --> 13:45.460\n You know what I mean?\n\n13:46.720 --> 13:48.000\n So I learned a lot.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.920\n I consider him, you know,\n\n13:49.920 --> 13:53.560\n especially when it comes to anything cinematic in my life,\n\n13:53.560 --> 13:56.320\n I consider him the godfather of that for me.\n\n13:56.320 --> 14:01.320\n I think, you know, I humbly asked him to mentor me,\n\n14:02.180 --> 14:04.560\n which is a very humbling thing to do\n\n14:04.560 --> 14:07.240\n coming from my neighborhood, coming from who I am,\n\n14:07.240 --> 14:11.240\n coming from, I was already a multi platinum artist,\n\n14:11.240 --> 14:13.900\n you know, I mean, it was a year,\n\n14:13.900 --> 14:16.120\n it was past the year 2000 already.\n\n14:16.120 --> 14:20.200\n So like 2001, 2002 that I asked him to mentor me.\n\n14:20.200 --> 14:23.560\n So I was the wizard already, you know what I mean?\n\n14:23.560 --> 14:28.440\n But I humbled myself because I saw in him\n\n14:28.440 --> 14:33.440\n a craft of brain power that to me resonated with me,\n\n14:34.200 --> 14:37.840\n but I was just a Patamon at it, I was a novice at it\n\n14:38.800 --> 14:42.200\n because I was trying to make movies in my music,\n\n14:42.200 --> 14:44.240\n you know, trying to make videos.\n\n14:44.240 --> 14:46.320\n And here was a man who was a master of it\n\n14:46.320 --> 14:48.740\n and an encyclopedia of it as well.\n\n14:50.360 --> 14:51.520\n Like film history.\n\n14:51.520 --> 14:54.240\n Film history from whether it's the actor,\n\n14:54.240 --> 14:56.680\n the director, the cinematographer,\n\n14:56.680 --> 14:58.480\n maybe even the costume designer.\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:00.280\n He may know 50, 60,\n\n15:00.280 --> 15:02.560\n he may know the 50 greatest costume designers\n\n15:02.560 --> 15:04.240\n in his memory.\n\n15:04.240 --> 15:06.360\n Yeah, I mean, it's a guy's brain.\n\n15:06.360 --> 15:08.160\n Both of you have pretty good memory.\n\n15:08.160 --> 15:09.680\n Yeah.\n\n15:09.680 --> 15:12.720\n I'd love to be a fly on the wall of that conversation.\n\n15:12.720 --> 15:14.560\n And kung fu movies, most of you guys want.\n\n15:14.560 --> 15:16.240\n We actually started,\n\n15:16.240 --> 15:19.720\n I think we started our relationship\n\n15:19.720 --> 15:21.520\n trying to outdo each other.\n\n15:21.520 --> 15:22.840\n Knowledge wise or what?\n\n15:22.840 --> 15:24.840\n Yeah, movie knowledge wise.\n\n15:24.840 --> 15:27.280\n Actually kung fu movie knowledge wise.\n\n15:27.280 --> 15:29.760\n And I think that, if it wasn't another category,\n\n15:29.760 --> 15:30.800\n I wouldn't have had a chance,\n\n15:30.800 --> 15:33.240\n but at least in that category,\n\n15:33.240 --> 15:35.160\n I was pretty holding my weight.\n\n15:35.160 --> 15:36.200\n For one.\n\n15:36.200 --> 15:37.440\n You know what?\n\n15:37.440 --> 15:42.080\n I'll be honest and say that I may have said a few,\n\n15:42.080 --> 15:44.920\n he didn't see, but Quentin is older than me.\n\n15:44.920 --> 15:45.760\n Yeah.\n\n15:45.760 --> 15:47.320\n So he could go back.\n\n15:47.320 --> 15:48.160\n Farther.\n\n15:48.160 --> 15:50.240\n Yeah, he could go back to 72\n\n15:50.240 --> 15:51.320\n when I didn't see one yet.\n\n15:51.320 --> 15:52.160\n You know what I mean?\n\n15:52.160 --> 15:53.000\n Yeah.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.080\n Well, he said Master of the Flying Gate Team\n\n15:55.080 --> 15:56.800\n that I got a chance to,\n\n15:56.800 --> 15:58.160\n that you commentated over today\n\n15:58.160 --> 16:00.160\n and I got a chance to see the screening of.\n\n16:00.160 --> 16:02.640\n He said that's one of his favorites.\n\n16:03.760 --> 16:08.000\n For you, the 36 Chamber of Shaolin,\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.080\n the Master Killer is your favorite.\n\n16:10.080 --> 16:11.920\n Best ever, would you say?\n\n16:11.920 --> 16:15.680\n That's the greatest Kung Fu movie ever?\n\n16:15.680 --> 16:18.080\n It's hard to say the greatest ever, right?\n\n16:18.080 --> 16:20.160\n Because somebody may make another one\n\n16:20.160 --> 16:22.600\n and it depends on your own phase of life.\n\n16:22.600 --> 16:27.600\n But I will put that first.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.200\n If I want to introduce somebody to Kung Fu movies,\n\n16:30.200 --> 16:32.360\n that's a beautiful entry.\n\n16:32.360 --> 16:35.000\n You talk about knowledge, you talk about wisdom.\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.600\n What kind of wisdom do you draw from Kung Fu movies?\n\n16:38.600 --> 16:39.840\n The, you know what?\n\n16:39.840 --> 16:42.520\n The martial art itself and the movies.\n\n16:42.520 --> 16:46.320\n It's endless wisdom to be drawn and I draw it, you know?\n\n16:47.600 --> 16:49.560\n I draw it in a way, you know,\n\n16:49.560 --> 16:52.480\n that I could decipher it in my own life.\n\n16:53.480 --> 16:58.480\n So for instance, in the movie, Master Killer,\n\n17:00.680 --> 17:04.040\n he basically, when he does Kung Fu,\n\n17:04.040 --> 17:08.000\n he does it really a style called the Hung Ga technique.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.240\n And the director of the movie\n\n17:10.240 --> 17:14.840\n is actually a Hung Ga expert who has a lineage\n\n17:14.840 --> 17:17.120\n that traces all the way back to Shaolin Temple.\n\n17:17.120 --> 17:21.480\n And this director always wanted to keep his movies pure\n\n17:21.480 --> 17:23.360\n and to bring Hung Ga to the world.\n\n17:23.360 --> 17:26.480\n It's like he wanted to show the world this lineage.\n\n17:26.480 --> 17:29.560\n In fact, you just said Master of the Flying Guillotine\n\n17:29.560 --> 17:30.840\n is Quentin's favorite movie.\n\n17:30.840 --> 17:33.120\n And we mentioned that 36 Chambers is my favorite movie,\n\n17:33.120 --> 17:36.840\n but the action director of Master of Flying Guillotine\n\n17:36.840 --> 17:40.720\n is the director of 36 Chambers of Shaolin.\n\n17:40.720 --> 17:43.040\n And some of the things that's happening\n\n17:43.040 --> 17:45.760\n in Master of the Flying Guillotine\n\n17:45.760 --> 17:47.560\n is really the infant stage\n\n17:47.560 --> 17:50.560\n of what this action director is going to learn\n\n17:50.560 --> 17:53.440\n and then use later on in his movies.\n\n17:53.440 --> 17:54.480\n So that's the beauty of it.\n\n17:54.480 --> 17:57.240\n It's almost like, you know,\n\n17:57.240 --> 17:59.840\n Quentin is seeing him in his generation.\n\n17:59.840 --> 18:02.320\n So Quentin might have been the same age I was\n\n18:02.320 --> 18:03.160\n watching that movie.\n\n18:03.160 --> 18:05.080\n And then when he becomes a director,\n\n18:05.080 --> 18:08.000\n I'm at Quentin's age and now I'm seeing his work.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.640\n So some symbionic relationship there.\n\n18:10.640 --> 18:13.000\n And I'll end this question by saying,\n\n18:14.480 --> 18:18.200\n Hung Ga deals with the five animal technique,\n\n18:18.200 --> 18:23.200\n the tiger, the crane, the leopard, the snake, and a dragon.\n\n18:24.560 --> 18:26.400\n Those are the five, that's the five pattern.\n\n18:26.400 --> 18:27.840\n Some people go seven, some go 12,\n\n18:27.840 --> 18:30.720\n but it's a stick to the five pattern fist.\n\n18:30.720 --> 18:35.400\n How do a man emulate a tiger?\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.040\n And you see a tiger's fists.\n\n18:40.400 --> 18:43.600\n He curls before he spawns on you.\n\n18:43.600 --> 18:46.520\n How does a man emulate a snake?\n\n18:47.720 --> 18:50.960\n It doesn't have to be only in the Kung Fu move.\n\n18:50.960 --> 18:54.760\n It's in the ideology of the snake.\n\n18:54.760 --> 18:58.480\n It's in the agility of the crane.\n\n18:58.480 --> 19:02.480\n At any moment, sometimes punching a person\n\n19:02.480 --> 19:04.480\n is not going to work,\n\n19:04.480 --> 19:07.240\n as they would say in leopard fist or tiger paw.\n\n19:07.240 --> 19:10.840\n So sometimes you might have to poke them in the eye\n\n19:10.840 --> 19:12.800\n with the crane's beak.\n\n19:12.800 --> 19:16.360\n So having your mind able to adapt the instinct\n\n19:17.280 --> 19:20.720\n of the animal when you are being attacked\n\n19:20.720 --> 19:22.640\n or when you are being the aggressor,\n\n19:24.120 --> 19:26.600\n that's something that you don't need a form for.\n\n19:26.600 --> 19:27.520\n That's the mentality.\n\n19:27.520 --> 19:30.800\n So Kung Fu, like I said, it informs me endlessly\n\n19:30.800 --> 19:34.520\n because at first I was trying to learn how to hold my,\n\n19:34.520 --> 19:35.960\n like, I can't really hit you with that\n\n19:35.960 --> 19:37.840\n and really hurt you unless I've been banging my hand\n\n19:37.840 --> 19:39.760\n a thousand times on some bricks\n\n19:39.760 --> 19:43.400\n and made it so callous or muscles are so strong.\n\n19:43.400 --> 19:47.720\n But the idea that if me and you was to get into a fight\n\n19:47.720 --> 19:50.880\n and I'm going to tiger up on you and take that instinct\n\n19:50.880 --> 19:53.280\n and prance when I'm a prance,\n\n19:53.280 --> 19:58.240\n or fly away like the stork, you know what I mean?\n\n19:58.240 --> 20:00.600\n Like, yo, that's the mentality.\n\n20:00.600 --> 20:02.800\n It's much more than the technical moves.\n\n20:02.800 --> 20:04.800\n It's much deeper.\n\n20:04.800 --> 20:05.640\n Yeah.\n\n20:06.640 --> 20:07.480\n Yeah, it's interesting.\n\n20:07.480 --> 20:08.880\n I mean, when I see the Kung Fu movies,\n\n20:08.880 --> 20:11.880\n because I love martial arts, all martial arts,\n\n20:11.880 --> 20:13.000\n and competitive ones too,\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.120\n like the actual competitions and so on.\n\n20:15.120 --> 20:18.400\n It just seems like Kung Fu movies go much deeper\n\n20:18.400 --> 20:20.160\n than just like the techniques.\n\n20:20.160 --> 20:23.240\n Yeah, they start, I mean, if you see it, right,\n\n20:23.240 --> 20:25.760\n even I watched the great MMA fight recently,\n\n20:27.080 --> 20:30.120\n just interesting because he was on top of the guy,\n\n20:32.560 --> 20:34.320\n and the way he got from under him,\n\n20:38.360 --> 20:42.200\n it had to be his spirit got from under him.\n\n20:42.200 --> 20:45.160\n It's some like mixture of crane and whatever.\n\n20:45.160 --> 20:48.920\n Snake, ill, with the slippery ill technique.\n\n20:48.920 --> 20:49.760\n Yeah.\n\n20:49.760 --> 20:52.920\n No, I love that when people become artists in the cage\n\n20:52.920 --> 20:56.040\n or that's much bigger than just like winning,\n\n20:56.040 --> 20:57.800\n much bigger than particular techniques.\n\n20:57.800 --> 21:00.640\n It's just art, especially at the highest level competition\n\n21:00.640 --> 21:02.720\n where millions of people are watching.\n\n21:02.720 --> 21:04.040\n Which is pressure within itself.\n\n21:04.040 --> 21:07.320\n Yeah, that's art under pressure\n\n21:07.320 --> 21:10.160\n is even more beautiful art.\n\n21:10.160 --> 21:11.760\n You know, you look at some of these fights\n\n21:11.760 --> 21:14.720\n and you wonder like why somebody wins and lose.\n\n21:16.240 --> 21:19.280\n And sometimes the less talent guy could win\n\n21:19.280 --> 21:21.600\n because he could deal with the pressure.\n\n21:21.600 --> 21:23.200\n But the other guy, he could have beat them\n\n21:23.200 --> 21:25.680\n if they were somewhere else, but not in this arena.\n\n21:28.280 --> 21:31.880\n So you're a scholar of history, including hip hop history.\n\n21:33.200 --> 21:35.400\n I've listened to so many of your interviews.\n\n21:35.400 --> 21:38.480\n You've spoken brilliantly about some of the big figures\n\n21:38.480 --> 21:43.240\n in hip hop history, Tupac, Biggie, Nas, many others.\n\n21:44.360 --> 21:47.200\n Maybe let's look at Tupac and Biggie.\n\n21:47.200 --> 21:49.880\n What made them special in the history of music?\n\n21:49.880 --> 21:52.000\n Mm, that's a good question.\n\n21:52.880 --> 21:56.200\n So I don't know if I'm the authority to answer it,\n\n21:56.200 --> 21:58.840\n but I'll just speak my piece on it.\n\n21:58.840 --> 22:00.720\n And maybe I could just add on.\n\n22:00.720 --> 22:02.040\n Cause I'm sure it's a lot of people\n\n22:02.040 --> 22:05.320\n that spent a lot of time with them that could speak on it.\n\n22:05.320 --> 22:07.160\n But just as a fellow artist,\n\n22:09.560 --> 22:14.480\n I think not only was B.I.G a dope lyricist,\n\n22:14.480 --> 22:19.480\n I think he had a voice that was really immaculate.\n\n22:19.480 --> 22:24.480\n In a sense that some rappers get on top of music\n\n22:25.840 --> 22:27.200\n and you gotta get used to them\n\n22:27.200 --> 22:30.400\n when you gotta vibe with them.\n\n22:30.400 --> 22:35.400\n But he make a record sounds like a record immediately.\n\n22:37.880 --> 22:40.760\n If you go back and listen to his music,\n\n22:40.760 --> 22:43.120\n you could take his voice and put it on anything.\n\n22:43.120 --> 22:47.280\n And for some reason, it sounds like a record.\n\n22:47.280 --> 22:48.120\n You know what I mean?\n\n22:48.120 --> 22:50.360\n You mean just like the raw voice of the man?\n\n22:50.360 --> 22:51.200\n Yeah.\n\n22:51.200 --> 22:52.760\n So you could just listen to it raw\n\n22:52.760 --> 22:54.200\n and it sounds like a record.\n\n22:54.200 --> 22:56.360\n Yeah, but if you put a beat,\n\n22:56.360 --> 22:58.240\n take his voice and put it on any beat,\n\n22:59.400 --> 23:04.160\n he just has a voice, it's immaculate, you know?\n\n23:04.160 --> 23:06.440\n So his lyrical skills and all that was great.\n\n23:07.760 --> 23:11.320\n And you gotta think once again, he's doing all this,\n\n23:11.320 --> 23:12.880\n he's not even 25 years old.\n\n23:12.880 --> 23:14.080\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n23:14.080 --> 23:18.840\n And then you go to Pac, once again, immaculate voice.\n\n23:18.840 --> 23:22.520\n But what Pac had, I think,\n\n23:22.520 --> 23:27.520\n was a way of touching us on all of our emotions.\n\n23:27.840 --> 23:30.960\n And especially on, like Pac had the power\n\n23:30.960 --> 23:33.800\n to infuse your emotional thought.\n\n23:33.800 --> 23:36.200\n Like Brenda has a baby, their mama.\n\n23:37.280 --> 23:41.600\n But then he had the power to arouse the rebel in you.\n\n23:41.600 --> 23:43.840\n You know?\n\n23:43.840 --> 23:44.680\n Yeah.\n\n23:44.680 --> 23:49.680\n And those two things, actually,\n\n23:49.680 --> 23:54.680\n he was probably more dangerous than Big, Notorious B.I.G.\n\n23:56.480 --> 23:59.360\n Like Notorious B.I.G., we could party with him.\n\n23:59.360 --> 24:01.360\n To this day, we are still,\n\n24:01.360 --> 24:04.440\n but Pac was probably going to a point,\n\n24:04.440 --> 24:07.800\n he was more going into the Malcolm X of things\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:12.200\n and society fears that.\n\n24:12.200 --> 24:15.440\n Yeah, so he was really good at communicating love\n\n24:15.440 --> 24:18.960\n and at starting revolutions.\n\n24:18.960 --> 24:20.080\n Yeah.\n\n24:20.080 --> 24:21.040\n And that's dangerous.\n\n24:21.040 --> 24:22.480\n Very dangerous.\n\n24:22.480 --> 24:24.720\n And they communicated love,\n\n24:24.720 --> 24:26.680\n but he wasn't starting revolutions.\n\n24:27.920 --> 24:29.920\n Well, it's interesting to think about\n\n24:29.920 --> 24:32.680\n what the world would be like if they were still with us.\n\n24:32.680 --> 24:35.360\n But it's the way of the world.\n\n24:35.360 --> 24:39.640\n Hendrix, a lot of those guys just go too soon.\n\n24:39.640 --> 24:41.480\n Yeah, it's a peculiar thing.\n\n24:41.480 --> 24:45.160\n Now, you asked me earlier, am I scared of death?\n\n24:47.280 --> 24:50.080\n And I answered, you know, I'm not scared of death.\n\n24:50.080 --> 24:51.320\n I'm not trying to see it, though.\n\n24:51.320 --> 24:52.680\n You know what I mean?\n\n24:52.680 --> 24:55.240\n It's like, that was the block of death.\n\n24:55.240 --> 24:57.640\n It's like, I'm not really going right there right now.\n\n24:57.640 --> 24:59.960\n I'm making a left or right turn.\n\n24:59.960 --> 25:00.960\n You know what I mean?\n\n25:00.960 --> 25:05.080\n Unless it was mandatory for some greaterness, greater good.\n\n25:05.080 --> 25:07.600\n It's like, okay, I got to drive through that.\n\n25:07.600 --> 25:08.440\n You know what I mean?\n\n25:08.440 --> 25:09.880\n Yeah, but it can still happen.\n\n25:09.880 --> 25:11.760\n That's the meditation on death part,\n\n25:11.760 --> 25:14.320\n where you could die at the end of today.\n\n25:14.320 --> 25:16.240\n Yeah, you could die.\n\n25:16.240 --> 25:17.760\n Well, dying and death, I think,\n\n25:17.760 --> 25:19.720\n is two different things, personally.\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:23.240\n The process you mean of death or just?\n\n25:23.240 --> 25:24.800\n Yeah, I mean, you could die.\n\n25:24.800 --> 25:26.600\n Like I said, you could die every day.\n\n25:26.600 --> 25:29.800\n You could die and not be yourself.\n\n25:29.800 --> 25:30.960\n You know what I mean?\n\n25:30.960 --> 25:32.760\n Which is crazy.\n\n25:32.760 --> 25:35.800\n But to get to a point of no return,\n\n25:35.800 --> 25:38.280\n you know, that's a whole nother chamber.\n\n25:38.280 --> 25:40.080\n I mean, there's some sense in which\n\n25:41.440 --> 25:46.120\n RZA, the producer, becomes somebody else completely\n\n25:46.120 --> 25:47.200\n when you're making a film,\n\n25:47.200 --> 25:49.040\n becomes somebody else completely\n\n25:49.040 --> 25:51.760\n when you're, I don't know, playing chess,\n\n25:51.760 --> 25:53.800\n becomes completely something different\n\n25:53.800 --> 25:57.240\n when you do kung fu or watch kung fu\n\n25:57.240 --> 25:58.720\n or when you're a family man.\n\n25:58.720 --> 25:59.960\n All of those are little deaths\n\n25:59.960 --> 26:02.320\n when you transition from one place to another.\n\n26:02.320 --> 26:04.240\n So it's not like you're one being.\n\n26:04.240 --> 26:06.520\n You're many things.\n\n26:06.520 --> 26:07.400\n Yeah.\n\n26:07.400 --> 26:08.800\n I would describe, now I would describe that\n\n26:08.800 --> 26:10.000\n as all life, dawg.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.640\n Yeah, it's fun.\n\n26:14.120 --> 26:18.200\n Outside of you and anybody on Wu Tang,\n\n26:18.200 --> 26:21.960\n who is the greatest rapper from a lyrics,\n\n26:21.960 --> 26:24.680\n like a Wart Smith perspective in hip hop history\n\n26:24.680 --> 26:27.000\n or some of the greatest, maybe some candidates?\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.600\n Let's name a few.\n\n26:28.600 --> 26:31.440\n I mean, you're gonna have to start with Rakim.\n\n26:31.440 --> 26:32.280\n You know?\n\n26:32.280 --> 26:34.640\n You're gonna have to pick Coogee Rap in there.\n\n26:34.640 --> 26:35.680\n You know what I mean?\n\n26:35.680 --> 26:36.640\n So going back.\n\n26:36.640 --> 26:37.960\n Yeah, you're gonna have to pick up\n\n26:37.960 --> 26:38.880\n with those brothers first.\n\n26:38.880 --> 26:41.120\n You might have to, if you want to get,\n\n26:41.120 --> 26:43.840\n technically you might have to start with Grandmaster Cass.\n\n26:43.840 --> 26:44.680\n You know what I mean?\n\n26:44.680 --> 26:46.480\n Who you might not even heard of.\n\n26:46.480 --> 26:47.320\n Nope.\n\n26:47.320 --> 26:48.160\n You know what I mean?\n\n26:48.160 --> 26:49.400\n But you may have sung his lyrics\n\n26:49.400 --> 26:52.080\n every time you sang Sugar Hill, Rapper's Delight.\n\n26:52.080 --> 26:52.920\n That's his?\n\n26:52.920 --> 26:56.760\n Yeah, they copied his and they made it theirs.\n\n26:56.760 --> 27:01.760\n That's my point being made, but I'll name a couple more.\n\n27:02.640 --> 27:04.600\n I gotta pick Nas in that category.\n\n27:05.680 --> 27:07.440\n You know, we got a chess board in front of us\n\n27:07.440 --> 27:10.400\n and one of the greatest chess players,\n\n27:10.400 --> 27:15.400\n the youngest Grandmaster, you know, before I think Carlson,\n\n27:16.520 --> 27:21.520\n was Bobby Fisher.\n\n27:21.640 --> 27:23.480\n All right, so let's use Bobby Fisher as American.\n\n27:23.480 --> 27:25.160\n One of the greatest American chess players.\n\n27:25.160 --> 27:27.720\n Of course, Susan Polgar may have tied his record\n\n27:27.720 --> 27:29.920\n as the youngest Grandmaster\n\n27:29.920 --> 27:32.920\n and she's the youngest female Grandmaster, I think to date.\n\n27:32.920 --> 27:37.520\n But he was a master at what, 14?\n\n27:37.520 --> 27:38.640\n Yeah, something like that.\n\n27:38.640 --> 27:39.520\n Right?\n\n27:39.520 --> 27:44.520\n So now to me, I met Nas when he was 15.\n\n27:44.640 --> 27:46.840\n He was already a master lyricist.\n\n27:46.840 --> 27:49.280\n It takes about 10 years to become a master lyricist.\n\n27:49.280 --> 27:52.800\n So by the time the world heard Wu Tang,\n\n27:52.800 --> 27:55.960\n most of us had 10 years of rapping in us already.\n\n27:55.960 --> 27:58.920\n So that's why you met us at mastery level.\n\n27:58.920 --> 28:02.320\n The Jizzer was already a master when Nas was a master,\n\n28:02.320 --> 28:04.920\n but Jizzer was 21, Nas was 15.\n\n28:06.880 --> 28:09.600\n Nas is like the Mozart of rap.\n\n28:09.600 --> 28:10.800\n Or the Bobby Fisher.\n\n28:10.800 --> 28:13.680\n Just Bobby Fisher, just born something in him.\n\n28:13.680 --> 28:15.280\n Or maybe those early years,\n\n28:15.280 --> 28:20.040\n just because he's not just good at the lyrics.\n\n28:20.040 --> 28:22.680\n He's also, he goes deep with it.\n\n28:22.680 --> 28:23.520\n Just like you.\n\n28:23.520 --> 28:25.320\n So he's like, there's depth.\n\n28:25.320 --> 28:30.320\n It's not just like mastery of the word smithing.\n\n28:30.960 --> 28:34.880\n It's just the message you actually get sent across.\n\n28:34.880 --> 28:35.720\n It's information.\n\n28:35.720 --> 28:36.560\n Yeah.\n\n28:36.560 --> 28:40.680\n Into a small phrase, right?\n\n28:40.680 --> 28:42.160\n That's the whole thing of energy.\n\n28:42.160 --> 28:46.720\n How do we condense all that energy into this\n\n28:46.720 --> 28:49.040\n so that it could fuel that?\n\n28:49.040 --> 28:52.400\n And he's definitely one of those artists,\n\n28:52.400 --> 28:54.200\n MCs that does that.\n\n28:54.200 --> 28:56.480\n And he was doing it at 15.\n\n28:56.480 --> 28:58.120\n Like I said, I think I'm five years\n\n28:58.120 --> 29:00.360\n or four or five years older than Nas.\n\n29:00.360 --> 29:03.240\n So I was always feeling my confidence\n\n29:03.240 --> 29:04.080\n of what I was doing.\n\n29:04.080 --> 29:06.000\n But I was like, this kid is only 15.\n\n29:07.840 --> 29:09.720\n I gotta step up my game.\n\n29:09.720 --> 29:12.960\n When he turned 19, then we got Illmatic.\n\n29:12.960 --> 29:13.800\n Yeah.\n\n29:15.200 --> 29:18.880\n From you, what are the best and most memorable lyrics\n\n29:18.880 --> 29:19.880\n you've ever written?\n\n29:22.120 --> 29:24.160\n Well, that's a hard question for me.\n\n29:24.160 --> 29:25.240\n The stuff stand out?\n\n29:25.240 --> 29:26.560\n Like stuff you're really proud of\n\n29:26.560 --> 29:29.520\n that was like important in your career?\n\n29:29.520 --> 29:34.520\n Yeah, I mean, I think I did a song called Sunshower.\n\n29:35.720 --> 29:38.440\n I don't know if we put it on the Wu Tang Forever double CD,\n\n29:38.440 --> 29:40.800\n but only on the international version.\n\n29:42.120 --> 29:44.560\n But if anybody could go get those lyrics\n\n29:44.560 --> 29:46.040\n and write those lyrics down,\n\n29:46.040 --> 29:47.440\n you could just put that in your pocket.\n\n29:47.440 --> 29:50.080\n And I'm sure that it'll answer at least about 25%\n\n29:50.080 --> 29:51.360\n of your life's problems.\n\n29:52.960 --> 29:53.960\n Well, that's a good one.\n\n29:53.960 --> 29:56.840\n Sunshine, where you talk about religion and God,\n\n29:56.840 --> 29:58.440\n that's good.\n\n29:58.440 --> 29:59.960\n I think it's on A Diagram.\n\n30:01.680 --> 30:02.720\n I'm not a record guy.\n\n30:02.720 --> 30:03.560\n Yeah.\n\n30:03.560 --> 30:04.400\n I'm a song guy.\n\n30:04.400 --> 30:05.240\n Might have been A Diagram.\n\n30:05.240 --> 30:06.520\n Do you have a lyric from it?\n\n30:06.520 --> 30:09.000\n Yeah, the answer to all questions.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:10.040\n You're talking about God.\n\n30:10.040 --> 30:11.040\n Yeah.\n\n30:11.040 --> 30:14.160\n The spark of all suggestions, of righteousness,\n\n30:14.160 --> 30:16.320\n the pathway to the road of perfection,\n\n30:16.320 --> 30:19.120\n who gives you all and never asks more of you,\n\n30:19.120 --> 30:22.320\n the faithful companion that fights every war with you.\n\n30:22.320 --> 30:25.560\n Before the mortal view of the prehistorical historical,\n\n30:25.560 --> 30:28.440\n he's the all in all you searching for the oracle.\n\n30:28.440 --> 30:29.960\n That's a good line, man.\n\n30:29.960 --> 30:31.720\n This is so good.\n\n30:31.720 --> 30:33.960\n A mission impossible is purely philosophical,\n\n30:33.960 --> 30:36.360\n but you can call on your deathbed\n\n30:36.360 --> 30:37.800\n when you're laying in the hospital.\n\n30:37.800 --> 30:39.440\n You will call on your deathbed.\n\n30:39.440 --> 30:42.880\n I had a big, I have a scientist friend.\n\n30:42.880 --> 30:47.160\n Well, my wife's best friend, Rebecca,\n\n30:47.160 --> 30:48.400\n she married a scientist.\n\n30:48.400 --> 30:49.200\n They both scientists.\n\n30:49.200 --> 30:53.800\n They both were scientists, and she married Dr. Neil.\n\n30:53.800 --> 30:55.680\n I ain't going to say their last names.\n\n30:55.680 --> 31:00.640\n But Neil and Rebecca, my wife's best friend, so they come over.\n\n31:00.640 --> 31:05.280\n And me and Neil, we go through the longest debates\n\n31:05.280 --> 31:07.080\n of science and religion.\n\n31:07.080 --> 31:08.320\n We just go.\n\n31:08.320 --> 31:10.240\n We could go break day with it.\n\n31:10.240 --> 31:18.360\n And before he had a child, he was more adamant.\n\n31:18.360 --> 31:22.080\n And I don't believe in God.\n\n31:22.080 --> 31:23.280\n You know what I mean?\n\n31:23.280 --> 31:25.920\n After a child, he still kept his thing.\n\n31:25.920 --> 31:27.400\n But I just hit him with the question.\n\n31:27.400 --> 31:29.560\n If you was about to die, because now you\n\n31:29.560 --> 31:31.120\n got a child to think about, right?\n\n31:31.120 --> 31:33.440\n It's different when you're thinking about yourself.\n\n31:33.440 --> 31:35.640\n If you was about to die, you don't\n\n31:35.640 --> 31:37.120\n think you're going to make that call.\n\n31:37.120 --> 31:40.400\n He's like, I'll make that call.\n\n31:40.400 --> 31:43.240\n And it kind of inspired my lyric, because it was like,\n\n31:43.240 --> 31:45.840\n yeah, you're going to.\n\n31:45.840 --> 31:48.080\n And I just want to say, as far as you mentioned lyrics,\n\n31:48.080 --> 31:49.560\n that is one of my favorite lyrics.\n\n31:49.560 --> 31:57.240\n But that's part two to Sunshower was the prequel to Sunshine.\n\n31:57.240 --> 32:00.720\n So if you ever get a chance to check out Sunshower,\n\n32:00.720 --> 32:04.120\n start us off with, trouble follows a wicked mind.\n\n32:04.120 --> 32:07.800\n 2020 vision of the prism of life,\n\n32:07.800 --> 32:11.160\n but still blind because you lack the inner.\n\n32:11.160 --> 32:14.440\n So every sinner could end up in the everlasting winter\n\n32:14.440 --> 32:16.840\n of hellfire.\n\n32:16.840 --> 32:19.560\n But thorns and splinters prick your eye out.\n\n32:19.560 --> 32:20.440\n You cry out.\n\n32:20.440 --> 32:22.160\n Your words fly out.\n\n32:22.160 --> 32:24.160\n You remain unheard.\n\n32:24.160 --> 32:28.320\n Suffering internal and external,\n\n32:28.320 --> 32:31.480\n along with the wicked fraternal of genitals and kernels,\n\n32:31.480 --> 32:34.400\n letting off thermal nuclear heat that burns you firmly\n\n32:34.400 --> 32:37.800\n and permanently upon the journey through the journal\n\n32:37.800 --> 32:39.480\n of the book of life.\n\n32:39.480 --> 32:41.880\n For those who took a life without justice\n\n32:41.880 --> 32:44.800\n will become just ice.\n\n32:44.800 --> 32:47.800\n It's been taught your worst enemy couldn't harm you\n\n32:47.800 --> 32:51.960\n as much as your own wicked thoughts.\n\n32:51.960 --> 32:55.400\n But people ought to be not unless in war.\n\n32:55.400 --> 32:57.000\n So they find themselves persecuted\n\n32:57.000 --> 33:00.480\n inside their own universal court.\n\n33:00.480 --> 33:02.160\n So it's a long one.\n\n33:02.160 --> 33:03.720\n It's like a three pager.\n\n33:03.720 --> 33:05.080\n Wow, that is about life.\n\n33:05.080 --> 33:10.320\n That's like character integrity, how to be in this world.\n\n33:10.320 --> 33:12.400\n And that ultimately connects to God.\n\n33:12.400 --> 33:13.720\n Yeah.\n\n33:13.720 --> 33:15.480\n Who's God to you?\n\n33:15.480 --> 33:19.680\n I'm glad you just asked that question because I actually,\n\n33:19.680 --> 33:23.680\n I'm going to have to make a distinguishable separation here.\n\n33:23.680 --> 33:24.200\n All right.\n\n33:24.200 --> 33:28.560\n And it's funny because I heard recently,\n\n33:28.560 --> 33:35.480\n I heard a rabbi was debating with this historian, Dr. Ben.\n\n33:35.480 --> 33:38.480\n I can't pronounce Dr. Ben name, but it was debating.\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:42.080\n And in the debate, they started going back\n\n33:42.080 --> 33:44.760\n through the etymology.\n\n33:44.760 --> 33:47.520\n They went way back beyond antiquity\n\n33:47.520 --> 33:48.640\n because they was debating.\n\n33:48.640 --> 33:52.280\n And so there was some things that was going deep.\n\n33:52.280 --> 33:54.920\n And they really went far, far back to kind\n\n33:54.920 --> 33:58.680\n of the first word of God.\n\n33:58.680 --> 34:01.880\n And when they pronounced it on this particular debate,\n\n34:01.880 --> 34:04.040\n it was Allah.\n\n34:04.040 --> 34:07.920\n And they said from that, they got Elohim.\n\n34:07.920 --> 34:11.760\n I've already agreed in my heart and my life\n\n34:11.760 --> 34:18.320\n that the father of this universe, proper name is Allah.\n\n34:18.320 --> 34:23.200\n And of course, in Allah, I get all.\n\n34:23.200 --> 34:28.640\n And I don't think that God is the same as that.\n\n34:28.640 --> 34:33.200\n I think Allah gives birth to God.\n\n34:33.200 --> 34:37.440\n In fact, if you take the word Allah, A L L A H,\n\n34:37.440 --> 34:40.120\n and you take it through numerology or numbers,\n\n34:40.120 --> 34:44.240\n the number letter A being 1, L being 12,\n\n34:44.240 --> 34:49.760\n and you add it all up to the last denominator,\n\n34:49.760 --> 34:51.800\n you're going to get the number 7.\n\n34:51.800 --> 34:53.640\n And the number 7 is going to bring you right back\n\n34:53.640 --> 34:57.000\n to that letter G. So Allah borns God,\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.160\n but God don't born Allah.\n\n34:59.160 --> 35:01.480\n How does that guy, how does Allah,\n\n35:01.480 --> 35:05.560\n connect to the oracle that you're\n\n35:05.560 --> 35:08.320\n going to be calling for when you're laying in the hospital?\n\n35:08.320 --> 35:11.240\n Well, what I was saying in that particular verse was that we're\n\n35:11.240 --> 35:12.240\n looking for the oracle.\n\n35:12.240 --> 35:13.960\n We're looking for somebody else or something\n\n35:13.960 --> 35:16.520\n to help us that nobody can really help you\n\n35:16.520 --> 35:17.560\n at the end of the day.\n\n35:21.800 --> 35:24.480\n So now that we, I don't want to say we're speaking on religion,\n\n35:24.480 --> 35:29.400\n but we're speaking on a way of life and a way of thinking.\n\n35:29.400 --> 35:32.200\n And I've read many books, of course.\n\n35:32.200 --> 35:36.240\n And I could say there's no book that my,\n\n35:36.240 --> 35:38.520\n the book that is the most strongest book I've ever read\n\n35:38.520 --> 35:40.320\n is actually the Holy Quran.\n\n35:40.320 --> 35:43.640\n It's stronger to me than the Bible, which I've read.\n\n35:43.640 --> 35:46.720\n It's stronger than quantum physics, which I've read.\n\n35:46.720 --> 35:48.600\n It's stronger than the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n35:48.600 --> 35:52.880\n It's just, and I read once a British scholar\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:56.040\n said it's the most stupidest book ever written.\n\n35:56.040 --> 35:59.640\n And it doesn't make sense.\n\n35:59.640 --> 36:02.240\n And so I said, oh, I see why he says that.\n\n36:02.240 --> 36:04.520\n I understand exactly why he said that as well.\n\n36:04.520 --> 36:05.840\n Why is that?\n\n36:05.840 --> 36:13.280\n Because the structure of the words are just, it's peculiar.\n\n36:13.280 --> 36:14.200\n You know what I mean?\n\n36:14.200 --> 36:16.440\n But it's almost like how some people's songs,\n\n36:16.440 --> 36:18.400\n you don't really know exactly what\n\n36:18.400 --> 36:19.800\n they say until years later.\n\n36:22.760 --> 36:24.720\n Yeah, you have, actually with Joe Rogan,\n\n36:24.720 --> 36:28.040\n I think you talked about how a joke of Dave Chappelle's\n\n36:28.040 --> 36:30.680\n hit you like a long time after this.\n\n36:30.680 --> 36:33.720\n So this is kind of like the Quran.\n\n36:33.720 --> 36:38.760\n I tend to believe that we human beings cannot possibly\n\n36:38.760 --> 36:41.760\n understand anything as big as these ideas.\n\n36:41.760 --> 36:44.680\n So just, I don't know.\n\n36:44.680 --> 36:48.440\n Did you think that, like are you humble in the face\n\n36:48.440 --> 36:51.440\n of just the immensity of it?\n\n36:51.440 --> 36:53.840\n To be honest, yes.\n\n36:53.840 --> 36:57.080\n I'm humble in the face of the, if you could say the word\n\n36:57.080 --> 36:58.800\n again, I pronounce words funny.\n\n36:58.800 --> 37:04.480\n The omnipotence, the omnescence, the magnitude,\n\n37:04.480 --> 37:07.480\n I'm humble in the face of Allah.\n\n37:07.480 --> 37:09.760\n The problem that I may have had was\n\n37:09.760 --> 37:12.000\n that I wasn't humble in the face of God\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:15.960\n because it's just a definable thing.\n\n37:15.960 --> 37:18.640\n And that's why I think a lot of us, and I'm not saying that,\n\n37:18.640 --> 37:22.120\n you know, I know when we say God we're trying to say Allah.\n\n37:22.120 --> 37:24.880\n Like people are saying that, but you're actually\n\n37:24.880 --> 37:27.680\n not saying the same thing because you're actually\n\n37:27.680 --> 37:31.080\n putting something beside him.\n\n37:31.080 --> 37:37.640\n And that's the reason why you can have as many gods.\n\n37:37.640 --> 37:41.040\n You can find a whole bunch of them, you know what I mean?\n\n37:41.040 --> 37:42.320\n But you're not going to find many.\n\n37:42.320 --> 37:45.080\n There's no body beside Allah.\n\n37:45.080 --> 37:45.800\n Allah is one.\n\n37:45.800 --> 37:50.000\n So I know it's a whole thing, but that's my heart is there.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:51.880\n I'm humbled by it.\n\n37:51.880 --> 37:54.320\n I'm at peace with it.\n\n37:54.320 --> 37:59.160\n And it doesn't take nothing or demerit anything from myself.\n\n37:59.160 --> 38:00.320\n That's the beauty of it.\n\n38:00.320 --> 38:03.360\n It doesn't take nothing from me from being who I feel.\n\n38:03.360 --> 38:06.720\n So if I say, if somebody woke up, yo, peace, God.\n\n38:06.720 --> 38:09.120\n I could take that because they're telling me that, yo,\n\n38:09.120 --> 38:10.200\n I'm a man of wisdom.\n\n38:10.200 --> 38:11.640\n I'm a man of strength.\n\n38:11.640 --> 38:13.800\n I'm a man of beauty.\n\n38:13.800 --> 38:15.760\n Or some attribute of that, you know what I mean?\n\n38:15.760 --> 38:17.760\n So Wu Tang, they the gods of rap.\n\n38:17.760 --> 38:18.640\n There's wisdom there.\n\n38:18.640 --> 38:19.320\n There's strength there.\n\n38:19.320 --> 38:19.840\n There's beauty.\n\n38:19.840 --> 38:21.160\n They will take that.\n\n38:21.160 --> 38:23.240\n Yeah.\n\n38:23.240 --> 38:25.160\n So Wu Tang is one of the greatest\n\n38:25.160 --> 38:29.520\n musical, artistic, philosophical groups ever.\n\n38:29.520 --> 38:31.480\n Let's look hundreds of years from now\n\n38:31.480 --> 38:34.320\n when humans or robots or aliens or whatever that's left here,\n\n38:34.320 --> 38:35.720\n they look back.\n\n38:35.720 --> 38:37.600\n What do you hope they remember about Wu Tang?\n\n38:37.600 --> 38:40.520\n What do you hope the legacy is?\n\n38:40.520 --> 38:43.080\n Well, even if it's thousands of years,\n\n38:43.080 --> 38:45.720\n I hope we don't get rid of the humans.\n\n38:45.720 --> 38:48.040\n But you know, look, whatever happens is going to happen.\n\n38:48.040 --> 38:51.600\n But I think that my philosophy on it\n\n38:51.600 --> 38:59.680\n is that we're going to continue to advance and continue\n\n38:59.680 --> 39:01.960\n to advance things around us.\n\n39:01.960 --> 39:04.600\n But I don't see us becoming extinct.\n\n39:04.600 --> 39:08.080\n Well, I mean, the reason I bring up Wu Tang in that context,\n\n39:08.080 --> 39:11.120\n and this is a special moment in human history.\n\n39:11.120 --> 39:13.840\n It's like 100 years, and we've created all of this music.\n\n39:13.840 --> 39:16.400\n Just if you think of all the richness of music that's\n\n39:16.400 --> 39:18.960\n been created over 100 years, it's\n\n39:18.960 --> 39:21.840\n not obvious to me that that's not going to stop.\n\n39:21.840 --> 39:23.720\n There's a flourishing here.\n\n39:23.720 --> 39:25.960\n So it's funny because I could see\n\n39:25.960 --> 39:29.480\n where the book of human history is written.\n\n39:29.480 --> 39:32.120\n There's a chapter on this period of time.\n\n39:32.120 --> 39:34.680\n And one of the things we did well is\n\n39:34.680 --> 39:39.400\n all the technological innovation with the rockets\n\n39:39.400 --> 39:40.720\n and with the internet.\n\n39:40.720 --> 39:42.520\n But then there's also the musical innovation\n\n39:42.520 --> 39:44.000\n and film innovation.\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.760\n Just so much art that's being created.\n\n39:45.760 --> 39:47.960\n And Wu Tang's a huge part of that.\n\n39:47.960 --> 39:50.360\n So I just wonder if there's a few sentences written\n\n39:50.360 --> 39:56.760\n about Wu Tang, it just makes me wonder how they remember.\n\n39:56.760 --> 40:00.520\n I would hope that people, no matter how many years,\n\n40:00.520 --> 40:02.480\n are inspired by us.\n\n40:02.480 --> 40:07.240\n But I will say, if I could just use Wu Tang as itself.\n\n40:07.240 --> 40:15.360\n So we first started off the witty, unpredictable talent\n\n40:15.360 --> 40:16.880\n and natural game.\n\n40:16.880 --> 40:19.600\n Natural game meaning natural wordplay.\n\n40:19.600 --> 40:27.080\n And then we went to the wisdom of the universe,\n\n40:27.080 --> 40:34.400\n the truth of Allah for a nation of God.\n\n40:34.400 --> 40:39.280\n Wisdom, universal, truth, Allah, nation, God.\n\n40:39.280 --> 40:41.400\n So let's just go back to a nation of God.\n\n40:41.400 --> 40:44.680\n Let's just take the last two letters.\n\n40:44.680 --> 40:46.680\n A nation of wisdom, strength, and beauty.\n\n40:50.920 --> 40:53.600\n And I'm going a little political here, but not going political.\n\n40:53.600 --> 40:56.040\n As we'll say, we're the greatest country in the world.\n\n40:56.040 --> 40:58.400\n What makes us the greatest?\n\n40:58.400 --> 40:59.760\n That should be a question we ask.\n\n40:59.760 --> 41:01.760\n Is it our wisdom?\n\n41:01.760 --> 41:03.560\n Is it our strength?\n\n41:03.560 --> 41:04.800\n Is it our beauty?\n\n41:04.800 --> 41:07.520\n Now, let's just say, off the easiest answer,\n\n41:07.520 --> 41:09.400\n you know it's our strength.\n\n41:09.400 --> 41:11.720\n We got the nukes.\n\n41:11.720 --> 41:14.800\n Nobody can really, between America and Russia,\n\n41:14.800 --> 41:17.040\n they say, that's the argument.\n\n41:17.040 --> 41:18.800\n Who could beat them?\n\n41:18.800 --> 41:21.080\n But where's the wisdom?\n\n41:21.080 --> 41:24.680\n Then they can argue, well, we got the technology.\n\n41:24.680 --> 41:26.200\n But then where's the beauty when there's\n\n41:26.200 --> 41:29.480\n so much suffering in the people?\n\n41:29.480 --> 41:30.600\n So it's not complete.\n\n41:30.600 --> 41:33.360\n The hope is that the wisdom is in the founding documents,\n\n41:33.360 --> 41:37.600\n in the imperfect but wise founding documents\n\n41:37.600 --> 41:41.760\n that celebrated freedom, that celebrated all the ideas,\n\n41:41.760 --> 41:45.520\n sort of having a lot of nukes, having a lot of airplanes\n\n41:45.520 --> 41:46.040\n and tanks.\n\n41:49.480 --> 41:50.320\n That's not important.\n\n41:50.320 --> 41:53.800\n And the hope is whatever we're doing here with this, quote,\n\n41:53.800 --> 41:56.680\n greatest country on Earth, that we preserve the ideas\n\n41:56.680 --> 41:59.120\n and help them flourish, just like you said.\n\n41:59.120 --> 42:00.680\n Well, that's what I mean.\n\n42:00.680 --> 42:03.080\n So if you go back to the Wu Tang,\n\n42:03.080 --> 42:05.680\n that's what we're striving for.\n\n42:05.680 --> 42:07.480\n We're striving for that.\n\n42:07.480 --> 42:12.240\n But you started unpredictable and just like, yeah.\n\n42:12.240 --> 42:16.600\n But got deep pretty quick.\n\n42:16.600 --> 42:19.520\n I got to talk to you about Bruce Lee.\n\n42:19.520 --> 42:20.800\n Who's Bruce Lee to you?\n\n42:20.800 --> 42:22.000\n Who is he to the world?\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:27.440\n What ideas of his were interesting to you?\n\n42:27.440 --> 42:29.680\n You talk about Hendrix and music.\n\n42:29.680 --> 42:31.280\n Bruce Lee is that in martial arts.\n\n42:31.280 --> 42:32.920\n He just seems to have changed the game.\n\n42:36.920 --> 42:39.080\n I don't know if the word bold is the right word to say,\n\n42:39.080 --> 42:44.800\n but I wouldn't as bold as to say that he was a minor prophet.\n\n42:44.800 --> 42:47.120\n And I got that concept from the Holy Quran\n\n42:47.120 --> 42:49.040\n where it says that we send prophets\n\n42:49.040 --> 42:52.200\n to every nation, every village.\n\n42:52.200 --> 42:55.320\n We don't let nobody not hear the word in some form\n\n42:55.320 --> 42:57.080\n because it won't be fair.\n\n42:57.080 --> 43:01.960\n And so if a law is merciful, even a man who's deaf\n\n43:01.960 --> 43:03.480\n has to somehow get a sign.\n\n43:03.480 --> 43:05.480\n I don't know if Moses saw a burning bush.\n\n43:05.480 --> 43:06.920\n There was nobody else to talk to,\n\n43:06.920 --> 43:08.280\n so he had to talk to the bush.\n\n43:08.280 --> 43:09.160\n I don't know.\n\n43:09.160 --> 43:11.520\n It could have been the bush this way too, right?\n\n43:11.520 --> 43:15.040\n But point being made, it says that they are minor prophets.\n\n43:15.040 --> 43:17.560\n And I see Bruce Lee as one of them\n\n43:17.560 --> 43:22.840\n because what he brought to the world through martial art\n\n43:22.840 --> 43:27.080\n was a whole shift in the dynamic of thinking.\n\n43:27.080 --> 43:30.640\n And that happens when certain entities are born.\n\n43:30.640 --> 43:36.600\n But he didn't do it only in a physical sense.\n\n43:36.600 --> 43:38.560\n He was also for the philosophizing\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:41.680\n in the same process.\n\n43:41.680 --> 43:45.960\n And he was also striving to be the best of himself.\n\n43:45.960 --> 43:48.720\n So you got three things going on.\n\n43:48.720 --> 43:54.120\n I studied Bruce Lee multiple times.\n\n43:54.120 --> 44:00.920\n And first, of course, when I saw my first Kung Fu movie,\n\n44:00.920 --> 44:03.440\n it wasn't really Bruce Lee.\n\n44:03.440 --> 44:07.480\n It was a few Green Hornet clips cut together.\n\n44:07.480 --> 44:08.960\n And then I saw Black Samurai.\n\n44:08.960 --> 44:13.400\n Then my following Kung Fu movies was like Fearless Fighters,\n\n44:13.400 --> 44:17.320\n the Ghostly Face, the Fist of Double K.\n\n44:17.320 --> 44:19.800\n But basically, in Fearless Fighters,\n\n44:19.800 --> 44:21.480\n the lady put the little kid on her back\n\n44:21.480 --> 44:25.880\n and flew across the ocean, across the lake, right?\n\n44:25.880 --> 44:28.000\n So Bruce wasn't doing that.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:31.680\n And then I went on to Five Deadly Venoms, and Spearman,\n\n44:31.680 --> 44:32.720\n and 36 Chambers.\n\n44:32.720 --> 44:39.800\n And these movies are beautiful, and yet they're all heightened.\n\n44:39.800 --> 44:42.960\n Bruce, they're heightened beyond doable.\n\n44:42.960 --> 44:43.760\n You're not going to.\n\n44:43.760 --> 44:44.640\n Yeah, it's surreal.\n\n44:44.640 --> 44:47.480\n They play with the world that's not of this world.\n\n44:47.480 --> 44:48.880\n Yeah.\n\n44:48.880 --> 44:51.200\n Bruce played with this world.\n\n44:51.200 --> 44:55.600\n So when I first saw Bruce, I actually\n\n44:55.600 --> 44:57.840\n didn't think he was as good as these guys.\n\n44:57.840 --> 45:00.520\n He can't fly.\n\n45:00.520 --> 45:03.760\n He's not flying in the movies, right?\n\n45:03.760 --> 45:07.080\n But then when I saw, because the first one I saw\n\n45:07.080 --> 45:11.240\n was The Big Boss, which they retitled Fist of Fury.\n\n45:11.240 --> 45:15.160\n But then when I saw Chinese Connection, which\n\n45:15.160 --> 45:19.280\n is the real Fist of Fury, right?\n\n45:19.280 --> 45:21.280\n I saw something different there.\n\n45:21.280 --> 45:24.280\n And I got enamored.\n\n45:24.280 --> 45:26.400\n And then, of course, Enter the Dragon, right?\n\n45:26.400 --> 45:28.080\n Just really complete.\n\n45:28.080 --> 45:32.080\n That's why my first album was Enter the Wu Tang,\n\n45:32.080 --> 45:33.520\n 36 Chambers of Shaolin.\n\n45:33.520 --> 45:35.560\n So it's Enter the Dragon and 36 put together,\n\n45:35.560 --> 45:38.320\n because those are the two epitomes.\n\n45:38.320 --> 45:40.280\n So what happened is that's young me.\n\n45:40.280 --> 45:43.320\n Then teenage me studies him again.\n\n45:43.320 --> 45:46.760\n And I realized, wow, look at his physicality.\n\n45:46.760 --> 45:50.840\n Look how he's really moving for real.\n\n45:50.840 --> 45:52.360\n And then I studied him again.\n\n45:52.360 --> 45:55.000\n Wow, look at what he's saying.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:56.000\n Then I studied him again.\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:59.800\n Wow, look at what he stands for.\n\n45:59.800 --> 46:04.640\n Which do you like in the realm of martial arts, the real\n\n46:04.640 --> 46:07.800\n or the surreal, or the dance between the two?\n\n46:07.800 --> 46:09.320\n Yeah, I like the dance between the two,\n\n46:09.320 --> 46:15.640\n because a movie, to me, is to entertain you.\n\n46:15.640 --> 46:23.480\n So I'm cool with Obi Wan Kenobi disappearing out of the cloak\n\n46:23.480 --> 46:25.960\n when Vader strikes him down.\n\n46:25.960 --> 46:27.560\n And then I'm like, yo, what happened?\n\n46:27.560 --> 46:30.280\n And he's like, run, Luke, run.\n\n46:30.280 --> 46:31.840\n I'm cool with that, right?\n\n46:31.840 --> 46:34.120\n Because that's the imagination.\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:36.520\n And the imagination gets stimulated to the point\n\n46:36.520 --> 46:40.200\n to where as things that we saw imagined by an artist,\n\n46:40.200 --> 46:42.280\n we strive to create in our real world.\n\n46:42.280 --> 46:47.720\n Thus, Star Trek, to me, is just a precursor to our cell phones.\n\n46:47.720 --> 46:51.880\n So for me, I like to mix the two.\n\n46:51.880 --> 46:54.360\n Yeah, it's funny how science fiction pushing\n\n46:54.360 --> 46:57.640\n into the impossible actually makes it realize eventually.\n\n46:57.640 --> 47:00.520\n We humans, once we see an idea on screen,\n\n47:00.520 --> 47:02.920\n no matter how wild it is, we're trying to make it.\n\n47:02.920 --> 47:04.040\n Yeah, we're trying to make it.\n\n47:04.040 --> 47:06.680\n Some weird young kid, he gets inspired and watch that.\n\n47:06.680 --> 47:08.280\n Be like, I'm going to build that.\n\n47:08.280 --> 47:09.040\n Exactly.\n\n47:09.040 --> 47:11.600\n So I don't know who's going to come with the Back\n\n47:11.600 --> 47:13.040\n to the Future time machine.\n\n47:13.040 --> 47:15.440\n But do you have any classmates that you think\n\n47:15.440 --> 47:17.880\n this is going to be a time machine?\n\n47:17.880 --> 47:20.360\n I thought you were going to Back to the Future, like the,\n\n47:20.360 --> 47:24.000\n what is it, the hoverboard?\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:25.000\n Or like the, uh?\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.520\n Yeah, at least.\n\n47:26.520 --> 47:29.600\n Somebody, they got, you see the one on the water?\n\n47:29.600 --> 47:30.240\n No.\n\n47:30.240 --> 47:33.200\n No, you know the surf hover?\n\n47:33.200 --> 47:34.400\n It's dope.\n\n47:34.400 --> 47:35.200\n Nice.\n\n47:35.200 --> 47:36.000\n It's dope.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:40.200\n It actually, if you are a Back to the Future fan,\n\n47:40.200 --> 47:43.040\n you feel like you made it to, you made it there.\n\n47:43.040 --> 47:43.840\n Yeah.\n\n47:43.840 --> 47:46.160\n Well, now we just got to work on the time trial.\n\n47:46.160 --> 47:49.960\n And it was cool to hear you talk about the Master of the Flying\n\n47:49.960 --> 47:57.040\n Gaijin today, that that inspired the lyric for the Wu Tang\n\n47:57.040 --> 47:58.800\n client, Nothing to F with.\n\n47:58.800 --> 48:00.000\n Yeah.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.240\n How does that go again?\n\n48:02.240 --> 48:03.640\n What, the curse word or the lyric?\n\n48:03.640 --> 48:04.440\n Nothing.\n\n48:04.440 --> 48:05.240\n OK.\n\n48:05.240 --> 48:06.280\n No, I remember the curse.\n\n48:06.280 --> 48:09.800\n I am Russian, but the lyric.\n\n48:09.800 --> 48:12.480\n I said, I be tossing and forcing.\n\n48:12.480 --> 48:13.840\n My style is awesome.\n\n48:13.840 --> 48:17.200\n I'm causing more family feuds than Richard Dawson.\n\n48:17.200 --> 48:20.080\n And the survey said, you're dead.\n\n48:20.080 --> 48:23.400\n The fatal flying guillotine chops off your head.\n\n48:23.400 --> 48:24.200\n Yeah.\n\n48:24.200 --> 48:25.000\n Yeah.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.760\n And it was interesting to see the guillotine in the movie\n\n48:27.760 --> 48:32.040\n today, how, I don't know.\n\n48:32.040 --> 48:33.720\n That's surreal, right?\n\n48:33.720 --> 48:34.520\n But it's not.\n\n48:34.520 --> 48:36.640\n It's like, it's engineering.\n\n48:36.640 --> 48:42.360\n It's both surreal and it just, and it adds this chaos\n\n48:42.360 --> 48:44.920\n into this real world that, and then challenges everybody\n\n48:44.920 --> 48:46.520\n to think what you're going to do with that.\n\n48:46.520 --> 48:46.840\n Yeah.\n\n48:46.840 --> 48:47.680\n How are you going to beat it?\n\n48:47.680 --> 48:48.000\n Yeah.\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:48.720\n How are you going to beat it?\n\n48:48.720 --> 48:51.440\n Both when you have like the good and the evil\n\n48:51.440 --> 48:54.280\n and the mix of the bad guys and good guys\n\n48:54.280 --> 48:56.120\n and you're not sure who the bad guys are.\n\n48:56.120 --> 48:58.520\n It's the old question of good versus evil, right?\n\n48:58.520 --> 48:59.240\n Yeah.\n\n48:59.240 --> 49:03.080\n Like you said, then the question of who was good, who was evil.\n\n49:03.080 --> 49:07.560\n But they all had a similar problem when the guillotine came.\n\n49:07.560 --> 49:11.000\n But in terms of the real, you mentioned The Godfather,\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:12.280\n good and evil.\n\n49:12.280 --> 49:13.600\n That's your favorite movie.\n\n49:13.600 --> 49:14.640\n Yeah.\n\n49:14.640 --> 49:16.120\n What makes it great, do you think?\n\n49:16.120 --> 49:20.360\n The characters, the study of family, of justice, of power.\n\n49:20.360 --> 49:21.280\n What connects with you?\n\n49:21.280 --> 49:25.160\n Oh, oh, I mean, every one of those themes\n\n49:25.160 --> 49:29.960\n connects in the real and it connects in a cinematic way\n\n49:29.960 --> 49:31.760\n as well.\n\n49:31.760 --> 49:34.360\n The difference, I think, with me and The Godfather\n\n49:34.360 --> 49:36.320\n was I've seen it during a period of time\n\n49:36.320 --> 49:38.720\n when my father was absent.\n\n49:38.720 --> 49:44.160\n And therefore, family structure and family values\n\n49:44.160 --> 49:49.200\n was actually adopted in my family because of that.\n\n49:49.200 --> 49:54.480\n Me and my brother Devon, we actually\n\n49:54.480 --> 49:59.040\n took so much heed to that movie and our family life.\n\n49:59.040 --> 50:08.040\n And we kind of mimic that family in its structure of somebody\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:10.280\n has to be the leader of the family,\n\n50:10.280 --> 50:11.320\n even if it was the younger.\n\n50:11.320 --> 50:14.960\n Michael was younger than Sonny and Fragile.\n\n50:14.960 --> 50:15.760\n You know what I mean?\n\n50:15.760 --> 50:17.360\n But he was worthy.\n\n50:17.360 --> 50:19.240\n And my brother Devon is older than me.\n\n50:19.240 --> 50:20.800\n My brother King is older than me.\n\n50:20.800 --> 50:23.400\n And it's funny, sometimes Devon calls King Fragile.\n\n50:23.400 --> 50:24.760\n And I know King wants to.\n\n50:24.760 --> 50:26.960\n King was actually, he actually was,\n\n50:26.960 --> 50:30.320\n he said he could beat our ass, to use my language.\n\n50:30.320 --> 50:31.440\n But you're Michael.\n\n50:31.440 --> 50:32.640\n Yeah.\n\n50:32.640 --> 50:38.720\n And not by choice, just by definition of that's what I am.\n\n50:38.720 --> 50:40.480\n You know what I mean?\n\n50:40.480 --> 50:44.920\n And it's just a blessing for me to have my older sister,\n\n50:44.920 --> 50:52.760\n my older brothers, and my younger brothers look to me as,\n\n50:52.760 --> 50:55.520\n just as a good light in the family.\n\n50:55.520 --> 50:57.920\n And like I said, that movie helped us.\n\n50:57.920 --> 51:01.120\n My sisters, too, we, the cool thing about my family,\n\n51:01.120 --> 51:02.960\n I don't know if I share this a lot,\n\n51:02.960 --> 51:05.720\n it's a big, we all watched these movies together.\n\n51:05.720 --> 51:10.080\n And so the A Diagram, Pole Fighter, Master Killer,\n\n51:10.080 --> 51:12.400\n Five Deadly Venoms, my family knows these movies.\n\n51:12.400 --> 51:15.800\n It's not just I know them.\n\n51:15.800 --> 51:19.920\n And then you extend it further, my friends know them, too.\n\n51:19.920 --> 51:26.160\n So there's a language that we all can have that actually film\n\n51:26.160 --> 51:29.080\n has informed our communication.\n\n51:29.080 --> 51:34.600\n So The Godfather, which also is still a fictitional story\n\n51:34.600 --> 51:39.880\n of something, but since it was based in reality,\n\n51:39.880 --> 51:42.680\n based on something real, and it was human,\n\n51:42.680 --> 51:48.120\n it wasn't so heightened, I think the purity of it resonates.\n\n51:48.120 --> 51:50.160\n And the purity of it is something\n\n51:50.160 --> 51:53.000\n that resonates with me.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:56.240\n You got to plan ahead.\n\n51:56.240 --> 51:58.960\n He didn't want to deal with the drugs,\n\n51:58.960 --> 52:02.240\n but that time of business was upon him.\n\n52:02.240 --> 52:05.320\n It's like, it's almost like, this is a tough one,\n\n52:05.320 --> 52:08.200\n like sometimes when the Muslim brothers come from the Middle\n\n52:08.200 --> 52:14.440\n East to America and they open up delis, they would sell ham.\n\n52:14.440 --> 52:17.160\n And we would go in there and complain to them,\n\n52:17.160 --> 52:19.760\n and make them like, they used to get mad at us\n\n52:19.760 --> 52:20.920\n when we came in.\n\n52:20.920 --> 52:22.360\n But that's as a kid.\n\n52:22.360 --> 52:25.600\n But as a man, I'm like, yo, he's here to sell.\n\n52:25.600 --> 52:28.360\n Now, he still don't have to sell to him.\n\n52:28.360 --> 52:32.280\n Vito Corleone didn't want to sell the drugs.\n\n52:32.280 --> 52:33.320\n He didn't have to do it.\n\n52:33.320 --> 52:34.560\n He didn't do it.\n\n52:34.560 --> 52:37.000\n And it cost him some bullets to eventually,\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:42.000\n somebody in the family ended up doing it.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:45.880\n What about this idea that it's family before everything else?\n\n52:45.880 --> 52:52.120\n So there's different laws you live according to in this world,\n\n52:52.120 --> 52:54.080\n and family is first.\n\n52:54.080 --> 52:55.240\n Yeah.\n\n52:55.240 --> 52:59.720\n That's mathematically correct.\n\n52:59.720 --> 53:01.280\n I like that.\n\n53:01.280 --> 53:06.800\n I mean, there's a certain sense of you look at powerful people.\n\n53:06.800 --> 53:08.360\n You look at Putin.\n\n53:08.360 --> 53:10.920\n There's a certain sense in which the people who\n\n53:10.920 --> 53:13.680\n are in the inner circle, that's who you take care of.\n\n53:13.680 --> 53:14.880\n That's family.\n\n53:14.880 --> 53:18.080\n And anyone else that crosses you,\n\n53:18.080 --> 53:21.840\n that there's a different set of ethics under which you\n\n53:21.840 --> 53:23.760\n operate for those people.\n\n53:23.760 --> 53:28.440\n Well, Jesus said the same thing.\n\n53:28.440 --> 53:30.440\n When he said, love thy neighbor and thy brother,\n\n53:30.440 --> 53:32.680\n he was talking about that community.\n\n53:32.680 --> 53:37.720\n When that other lady, the Samaritan, say, hey, Jesus,\n\n53:37.720 --> 53:39.840\n my brother not feeling so well, and he said,\n\n53:39.840 --> 53:42.400\n give not that which is holy unto the dogs.\n\n53:42.400 --> 53:46.200\n If you're going to tell a woman, give not\n\n53:46.200 --> 53:48.760\n that which is holy unto the dogs.\n\n53:48.760 --> 53:49.520\n And she's a woman.\n\n53:49.520 --> 53:51.760\n He just called her a dog.\n\n53:51.760 --> 53:55.680\n If I translate that into hip hop, she's a female.\n\n53:55.680 --> 53:57.160\n He called her a dog.\n\n53:57.160 --> 53:58.840\n I know how that goes.\n\n53:58.840 --> 54:02.360\n But she said to him, but even a dog\n\n54:02.360 --> 54:04.560\n is allowed to eat the crumbs that\n\n54:04.560 --> 54:07.960\n falls from the master's table.\n\n54:07.960 --> 54:09.520\n And he went and helped.\n\n54:09.520 --> 54:10.160\n He helped her.\n\n54:10.160 --> 54:12.560\n Now, let's go back to what you just said about Putin\n\n54:12.560 --> 54:15.400\n or Vito Corleone or myself and my family.\n\n54:15.400 --> 54:17.760\n Of course, the family is first.\n\n54:17.760 --> 54:20.680\n But once the family is good, it has\n\n54:20.680 --> 54:23.320\n to then spread to the community, then\n\n54:23.320 --> 54:27.800\n to the state, country, world.\n\n54:27.800 --> 54:29.600\n The problem we have sometimes is that,\n\n54:29.600 --> 54:31.800\n and this is the reason why a lot of powerful families\n\n54:31.800 --> 54:33.920\n was overthrown, like why do they behead\n\n54:33.920 --> 54:36.440\n their own king with the guillotine, right?\n\n54:36.440 --> 54:40.400\n Because once the family was strong,\n\n54:40.400 --> 54:48.640\n they didn't let the wealth, the opportunity expand out.\n\n54:48.640 --> 54:53.400\n You look at Wu Tang, yes, our family was made strong first.\n\n54:53.400 --> 54:56.280\n But then all the Wu members were able to form\n\n54:56.280 --> 54:57.840\n their own corporations.\n\n54:57.840 --> 55:00.320\n And they had their own subfamilies.\n\n55:00.320 --> 55:01.400\n It has to grow out.\n\n55:01.400 --> 55:03.120\n And they took over the world.\n\n55:03.120 --> 55:05.960\n You've talked about being vegan.\n\n55:05.960 --> 55:09.640\n I don't think I heard you explain this,\n\n55:09.640 --> 55:14.800\n because it connects somehow about how you think about life.\n\n55:14.800 --> 55:16.880\n So you talk about when your family's good,\n\n55:16.880 --> 55:19.240\n you grow that circle of empathy.\n\n55:19.240 --> 55:21.280\n You grow the community.\n\n55:21.280 --> 55:24.720\n Is that how you think about being vegan,\n\n55:24.720 --> 55:29.720\n that just the capacity of living beings on Earth to suffer,\n\n55:29.720 --> 55:33.400\n that you just don't want to add suffering to them?\n\n55:33.400 --> 55:36.360\n Yeah, I mean, you said it clear.\n\n55:36.360 --> 55:40.800\n It's like nothing, in all reality,\n\n55:40.800 --> 55:42.880\n I came to a realization that nothing really\n\n55:42.880 --> 55:46.160\n has to die for me to live.\n\n55:46.160 --> 55:47.120\n No animal.\n\n55:47.120 --> 55:49.520\n The plants themselves, right?\n\n55:49.520 --> 55:53.960\n So let's just say you want a steak, which is probably\n\n55:53.960 --> 55:57.280\n the most, I don't know, the most expensive piece of meat.\n\n55:57.280 --> 56:01.360\n But let's just say the steak is top of the line, nice steak.\n\n56:01.360 --> 56:03.560\n And you're eating the steak for the protein to help\n\n56:03.560 --> 56:05.200\n build your muscle.\n\n56:05.200 --> 56:07.640\n And I don't know if you got it from a cow or a bull,\n\n56:07.640 --> 56:09.480\n but whether it's a cow or a bull,\n\n56:09.480 --> 56:11.920\n they grow to about 1,500 pounds.\n\n56:11.920 --> 56:16.520\n And if it's a bull, it's all muscly muscle.\n\n56:16.520 --> 56:17.840\n And it's only eating grass.\n\n56:20.920 --> 56:22.040\n Yeah.\n\n56:22.040 --> 56:26.760\n Yeah, it's possible to, both as an athlete\n\n56:26.760 --> 56:28.880\n and just as a human being, to perform well\n\n56:28.880 --> 56:29.880\n without eating meat.\n\n56:29.880 --> 56:32.520\n That's something, especially in the way\n\n56:32.520 --> 56:37.520\n we're treating animals, to deliver that meat to the plate.\n\n56:37.600 --> 56:38.600\n I think about that a lot.\n\n56:38.600 --> 56:42.120\n So I do, I'm a robotics person, AI person.\n\n56:42.120 --> 56:44.800\n And I think a lot about, I don't know if you think\n\n56:44.800 --> 56:47.320\n about this kind of stuff, but building AI systems\n\n56:47.320 --> 56:49.880\n as they become more and more humanlike,\n\n56:49.880 --> 56:52.720\n you start to ask the question of, are we okay?\n\n56:55.360 --> 56:59.000\n If we give the capacity for AI systems to suffer,\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.440\n first to feel, but then to suffer,\n\n57:02.440 --> 57:05.760\n to hate and to love, to feel emotion,\n\n57:05.760 --> 57:07.560\n how do we deal with that?\n\n57:07.560 --> 57:11.000\n It starts asking the same question as you ask of animals.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:14.560\n Are we okay adding that suffering to the world?\n\n57:14.560 --> 57:15.720\n Right.\n\n57:15.720 --> 57:17.520\n And I don't think we should add the suffering\n\n57:17.520 --> 57:19.400\n because it's not necessary.\n\n57:19.400 --> 57:22.400\n Like, look, if it's necessary, right,\n\n57:22.400 --> 57:25.400\n because we're survival or the first law of nature,\n\n57:25.400 --> 57:28.840\n self preservation, if you are in a desert\n\n57:28.840 --> 57:30.120\n and there's nothing else to eat,\n\n57:30.120 --> 57:33.640\n but that lizard, yeah, okay, you gotta do what you gotta do.\n\n57:33.640 --> 57:34.680\n Lizard's gotta go.\n\n57:34.680 --> 57:36.400\n Yeah, you gotta go, you gotta do what you gotta do.\n\n57:36.400 --> 57:38.840\n Because at the end of the day, man is,\n\n57:38.840 --> 57:41.800\n when they say man has dominion over these things,\n\n57:41.800 --> 57:45.520\n his dominion is almost like a caretaker.\n\n57:45.520 --> 57:48.080\n The way we do our dominion, we dominate it,\n\n57:48.080 --> 57:49.760\n eat it, cook it.\n\n57:49.760 --> 57:53.760\n Like who's the first guy that looked at the lobster?\n\n57:53.760 --> 57:56.400\n He was like, I'm gonna eat this thing.\n\n57:56.400 --> 57:59.000\n Like, first of all, it's hard to eat it.\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.480\n You gotta go through a process to get that.\n\n58:01.480 --> 58:04.440\n A crab, I remember we used to eat crabs when we was kids\n\n58:04.440 --> 58:06.720\n and I didn't know why I was always getting itchy throats\n\n58:06.720 --> 58:09.000\n and all that, you know, you don't know, just eat.\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.800\n But at the end of the day, a crab didn't provide\n\n58:11.800 --> 58:15.680\n no more than a finger worth of meat maybe.\n\n58:15.680 --> 58:18.760\n And it was hell getting that thing, getting it out.\n\n58:18.760 --> 58:20.880\n It's like, it's not worth it in all reality.\n\n58:20.880 --> 58:25.960\n You could have gave me a banana\n\n58:25.960 --> 58:30.760\n and did better for my body and my appetite\n\n58:30.760 --> 58:33.840\n and my being fulfilled as full.\n\n58:33.840 --> 58:38.880\n Like, look at the blessings of life, right?\n\n58:38.880 --> 58:45.480\n If you take a seed or you get an apple and you eat it,\n\n58:45.480 --> 58:49.240\n in that apple is multiple seeds in it.\n\n58:49.240 --> 58:53.040\n If you plant that seed, it'll give you a whole tree\n\n58:53.040 --> 58:56.760\n with a whole bunch of apples with all multiple seeds.\n\n58:56.760 --> 59:02.120\n But if you kill a fish, it can't reproduce, it's done.\n\n59:02.120 --> 59:04.840\n If you kill a, it's done, it's nothing coming back.\n\n59:04.840 --> 59:07.000\n But when you deal with the plants,\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:11.760\n even after you eat the apple and then you defecate,\n\n59:11.760 --> 59:14.400\n your defecation is what feeds the ground\n\n59:14.400 --> 59:16.200\n to cause the apple to grow more.\n\n59:16.200 --> 59:18.000\n Yeah, it's a circle of life.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:21.280\n And especially there's a guy named David Foster Wallace,\n\n59:21.280 --> 59:24.560\n he wrote a short story called Consider the Lobster.\n\n59:24.560 --> 59:27.800\n If you actually think philosophically about what,\n\n59:27.800 --> 59:30.680\n from a perspective of a lobster,\n\n59:30.680 --> 59:32.240\n that's like symbolic of something\n\n59:32.240 --> 59:36.880\n because you're basically put in the water, like cold water,\n\n59:36.880 --> 59:41.160\n and then it heats up slowly until it's no more.\n\n59:41.160 --> 59:43.040\n It's torture, yeah, it must have been like,\n\n59:43.040 --> 59:44.440\n do you think they started eating lobsters\n\n59:44.440 --> 59:45.840\n in the Inquisition?\n\n59:45.840 --> 59:47.920\n Yeah, they just enjoy,\n\n59:47.920 --> 59:50.040\n they would probably enjoy torturing animals\n\n59:50.040 --> 59:51.600\n and they realize they're also delicious\n\n59:51.600 --> 59:52.840\n after the torture is finished,\n\n59:52.840 --> 59:54.880\n that's probably how they discovered it.\n\n59:54.880 --> 59:55.840\n Let me ask you a question,\n\n59:55.840 --> 59:56.960\n I know you're asking me the questions,\n\n59:56.960 --> 59:58.920\n but I just wanna talk a little bit about the AI,\n\n59:58.920 --> 1:00:01.320\n and you said something about trying to\n\n1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:03.760\n put the emotion in it, right?\n\n1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:10.880\n So are you thinking there's an algorithm for emotion?\n\n1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:15.680\n Yes, but I think emotion isn't something\n\n1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:19.480\n that there's an algorithm for for a particular system,\n\n1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:21.400\n we create emotions together.\n\n1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:25.440\n So emotion is something like this conversation,\n\n1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:27.560\n it's like magic we create together.\n\n1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:30.880\n So I've worked with quite a few robots,\n\n1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:33.000\n I've a very simple version of that,\n\n1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.120\n I've had Roomba vacuum cleaners,\n\n1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:37.680\n I've had them make different sounds\n\n1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:41.160\n and one of them is like screaming in pain, like lightly,\n\n1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:43.120\n and just having them do that when you kick them\n\n1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:44.520\n or when they run into stuff,\n\n1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.800\n immediately I start to feel something for them.\n\n1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:50.360\n So the emotion, okay, so the emotion you're saying\n\n1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:53.240\n is imposed back on the human,\n\n1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:55.440\n but I'm asking, do you think there's an algorithm\n\n1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:58.960\n for the emotion to be imposed from machine to machine?\n\n1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:01.680\n Yeah, that's a really good way to ask it.\n\n1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:06.920\n It's difficult because I think ultimately\n\n1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:09.240\n I only know how to exist in the human world.\n\n1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:11.040\n So it's like, it's the question of\n\n1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:13.960\n if a tree falls in the forest, nobody's there to see it,\n\n1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:15.400\n does it still fall?\n\n1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:19.440\n I still think that ultimately machines will have to\n\n1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.640\n show emotion to other humans\n\n1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:24.280\n and that's when it becomes real.\n\n1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:26.480\n I've been thinking about this a lot too.\n\n1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:29.520\n And I just, okay.\n\n1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:32.200\n No, I'm not gonna hit you with this\n\n1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:33.040\n because I've been thinking about this\n\n1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:34.560\n and this is your field here.\n\n1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:38.720\n Well, do you think the emotion is wave?\n\n1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:43.720\n Like light is wave or do you think it's particle?\n\n1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:47.640\n So emotion is just a small,\n\n1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:49.360\n it's like a shadow of something bigger.\n\n1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:52.000\n And I think that bigger thing is consciousness.\n\n1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.720\n So emotion is just.\n\n1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:55.280\n I don't know if it's a wave or a particle.\n\n1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:57.280\n I haven't thought about that.\n\n1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:00.880\n I have thought about it, whether it's,\n\n1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:04.400\n there's something like whether consciousness\n\n1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:06.640\n or emotion is a law of physics.\n\n1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:09.560\n Like if it's that fundamental to the universe.\n\n1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:14.240\n I had a lyric that said this, it comes out.\n\n1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:15.760\n They did this documentary about the planet\n\n1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:19.560\n and I wrote a song, it's called The World of Confusion.\n\n1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:21.280\n And I'll try to paraphrase the lyric,\n\n1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:22.720\n but in the world of the confusion,\n\n1:02:22.720 --> 1:02:23.960\n where there's so much illusions,\n\n1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:26.480\n we suck the blood from the planet.\n\n1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:28.320\n Now it needs a transfusion\n\n1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:30.320\n and the redistribution of wealth,\n\n1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:35.320\n of health and wealth of self\n\n1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:38.440\n and a deeper understanding about mental health.\n\n1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:43.600\n The doctor prescribed the physical solution.\n\n1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:49.800\n The psychiatrist wants to build a bigger institution,\n\n1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:55.320\n but neither have the solution or the equation\n\n1:02:56.200 --> 1:02:58.840\n to make an instrument to measure\n\n1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:02.200\n the weight of the hate vibration.\n\n1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:05.600\n What is the weight of hate?\n\n1:03:06.560 --> 1:03:08.560\n Is it heavier than the weight of love?\n\n1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:15.320\n Is it heavier than the weight of lead inside of a slug?\n\n1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:19.080\n With just 10 milligrams, it's all it takes to kill a man.\n\n1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:20.560\n But anyways, do not go on from there.\n\n1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:21.800\n Damn, that's good.\n\n1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:23.920\n But the question, you see the question there, right?\n\n1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:26.400\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, can it be measured?\n\n1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:27.560\n Can that be measured?\n\n1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.480\n I think so, I think so.\n\n1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:30.960\n Just look at the instrument, yeah.\n\n1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.240\n Yeah, we're in the dark ages of that,\n\n1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:36.360\n but I think it could be measured.\n\n1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:39.120\n I think there's something physical,\n\n1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:42.200\n like something that connects us all this much.\n\n1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:44.920\n We tend to think we humans are distinct entities\n\n1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:46.120\n and we move about this world,\n\n1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:48.880\n but I think there's some deeper connection.\n\n1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:53.320\n And, but we're so, listen, science is in the,\n\n1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:55.920\n we just had a few breakthroughs in the past 100 years\n\n1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:58.880\n from Einstein on the theoretical physics side.\n\n1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:00.880\n We don't know anything about human psychology.\n\n1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:03.800\n We barely know much about human biology.\n\n1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:05.720\n We're trying to figure it all out.\n\n1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:08.680\n Yeah, I had another theory,\n\n1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:12.840\n because, you know, you think about quantum, right?\n\n1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:16.520\n As long as you say that there's an uncertainty\n\n1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:20.280\n and you have me believe there's an uncertainty,\n\n1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:22.200\n then there's an uncertainty.\n\n1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:25.240\n But if there's not an uncertainty, what happens?\n\n1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:28.480\n So I'm only saying that, it's not,\n\n1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:29.960\n because you look at quantum computers,\n\n1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:32.760\n they're gonna give you the O, the one,\n\n1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:35.440\n the one, the O, they're gonna take two things\n\n1:04:35.440 --> 1:04:36.440\n and make it eight things.\n\n1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:39.360\n And by the time you multiply four of those things together,\n\n1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:41.200\n it's like this chess board, right?\n\n1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:44.080\n The moves goes into the millions.\n\n1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:49.080\n But the thing that's introduced is the uncertainty, right?\n\n1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:52.560\n You're gonna make a move.\n\n1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:57.560\n You know this already, right?\n\n1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:04.040\n Because this has been played a thousand times,\n\n1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:06.600\n but sooner or later, something uncertain is gonna come in\n\n1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:08.440\n or make your next move.\n\n1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:15.920\n I like the weight of these.\n\n1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:18.320\n They add the certainty.\n\n1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:20.600\n I think just like what we were saying, unpredictable,\n\n1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:22.800\n there's something about us humans\n\n1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:25.720\n that really doesn't like everything to be fully predictable.\n\n1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:30.640\n I mean, chess too is perfectly solvable.\n\n1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:32.840\n There's nothing unpredictable about chess.\n\n1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:34.440\n Right, well, I could agree to that\n\n1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:39.440\n because Bobby Fischer said in one of his books,\n\n1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:41.440\n which I actually love what he said.\n\n1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.560\n He said, every game of chess is a draw.\n\n1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:49.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:52.840\n The only way somebody win is when one of us makes a mistake.\n\n1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:56.200\n I mean, it doesn't get any better than that.\n\n1:05:56.200 --> 1:05:57.200\n Yeah, it doesn't.\n\n1:05:57.200 --> 1:05:59.320\n What is chess?\n\n1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:00.520\n Like, how do you think about chess?\n\n1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:02.440\n What's at the core of your interest in chess?\n\n1:06:02.440 --> 1:06:07.440\n Do you see Kung Fu, music, film, all of it, life,\n\n1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:09.800\n all just living through chess?\n\n1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:14.800\n Yeah, I see, it's the most stimulating passage of time\n\n1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:19.800\n for me that's also, it's like, it's a pastime\n\n1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:24.800\n that stimulates my mind, my music,\n\n1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:27.120\n my thoughts about life at the same time.\n\n1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:28.680\n So while some pastimes is like,\n\n1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:30.640\n say baseball is a pastime.\n\n1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:31.640\n And baseball could stimulate you\n\n1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:32.880\n depending on how you look at it, right?\n\n1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:36.000\n But most likely, you're not gonna get\n\n1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:39.480\n this much brain activation, this much calculation,\n\n1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:41.280\n and this much thinking about yourself\n\n1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:43.960\n in a game of baseball.\n\n1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:47.640\n I mean, the player maybe, but not the viewer.\n\n1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:51.000\n Chess is something that I can engage in too.\n\n1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.320\n And even though it's a pastime,\n\n1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:59.120\n it's given me all the stimulation of real time in my life.\n\n1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:02.280\n It's funny because it's also, it's a funny game\n\n1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:06.920\n because it's connected through centuries of play.\n\n1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:09.520\n Just some of the most interesting people\n\n1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:11.840\n in the history of the world have played this game\n\n1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:14.480\n and have struggled with whatever,\n\n1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:17.000\n have projected their struggles onto the chessboard\n\n1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.080\n and thought, and the nations have fought\n\n1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:20.760\n over the chessboard.\n\n1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:22.520\n The Soviet Union versus the United States,\n\n1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:24.520\n Bobby Fischer represented the United States.\n\n1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:26.360\n Spassky represented the Soviet Union.\n\n1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:27.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:30.520\n I gotta, before I lose track of it,\n\n1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:32.440\n when we were talking about The Godfather,\n\n1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:35.960\n you were in American Gangster, great film.\n\n1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:37.440\n You said it's one of your favorites too.\n\n1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:41.880\n What, you were in it with Denzel Washington.\n\n1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:44.200\n What makes that movie meaningful to you?\n\n1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:47.200\n What was it like making that movie?\n\n1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:49.360\n Because it's a great, great American film.\n\n1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:50.680\n That was a great American film.\n\n1:07:50.680 --> 1:07:52.360\n It was so many things in that film.\n\n1:07:52.360 --> 1:07:55.560\n Being a part of that film was probably a blessing\n\n1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:59.360\n and a treasure, because even if I wasn't a part of it,\n\n1:08:00.320 --> 1:08:02.800\n it just caught such great filmmaking\n\n1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:07.800\n and to me, a really cool, great story.\n\n1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:11.240\n The thing that I love about it the most\n\n1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:15.760\n really is the process of it.\n\n1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:19.360\n Which part of the process?\n\n1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:22.560\n I wouldn't have known the process if I wasn't part of it.\n\n1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:25.040\n So as a film joy, it was a great film,\n\n1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:27.960\n but even the process of making it\n\n1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:32.560\n was like high level education for me on multiple levels.\n\n1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:36.320\n I'm working with Ridley Scott, which is,\n\n1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:38.600\n and this is a bold statement if I say this here,\n\n1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:41.640\n cause I got a lot of friends that's going to probably,\n\n1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:44.280\n but he's probably the best living director.\n\n1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:51.320\n Because watching him allowed me to understand\n\n1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:54.160\n a principle that I've coined to him\n\n1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:57.560\n and I don't know if people use it yet, called multi vision.\n\n1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:02.560\n He seems to have the capacity to see eight things\n\n1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:09.480\n at one time.\n\n1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:11.800\n I heard on Robin Hood, he had 18 cameras.\n\n1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:13.320\n I wasn't there for that.\n\n1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:15.600\n And you think he keeps them all in his mind, just seeing.\n\n1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:19.200\n I seen him do it when he went to the monitors\n\n1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:22.320\n with the video playback guy.\n\n1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:26.480\n I seen him bring everything back to a point,\n\n1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:30.080\n but nothing was the same on the frame.\n\n1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.280\n He was already there.\n\n1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:36.360\n And he knew if he had what he was or not.\n\n1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:39.840\n And he placed the cameras there.\n\n1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:43.200\n And he saw it in his own way.\n\n1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:46.480\n And I peeped it.\n\n1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:47.640\n I peeped it.\n\n1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:48.800\n And I said, yeah.\n\n1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:50.680\n And I just humbly asked him.\n\n1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:56.000\n He was gracious enough to speak to me and talk to me.\n\n1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.480\n And confirm what I thought I saw.\n\n1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:00.280\n He confirmed it.\n\n1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:01.000\n He confirmed it.\n\n1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.280\n And I was able to utilize it, as I'm a filmmaker now.\n\n1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:09.120\n And I see, I can at least see three or four things.\n\n1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:10.280\n I can't see eight yet.\n\n1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:12.760\n I'll be there though.\n\n1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:15.920\n But I could definitely, even right now,\n\n1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:21.040\n just I could go like this in the room, OK?\n\n1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:22.320\n I got it now.\n\n1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:25.400\n I got how to make this right here,\n\n1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:27.000\n which is just us all sitting.\n\n1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.240\n How do I make this dramatic?\n\n1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:31.280\n Look, boom.\n\n1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:31.920\n Come on on him.\n\n1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:32.880\n There's a story there.\n\n1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:34.000\n There's a story there.\n\n1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.320\n And I might just go off his hanging watch\n\n1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:38.040\n or his hanging wristband.\n\n1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:38.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:40.320\n Because there's something else there too.\n\n1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:40.920\n Is he dead?\n\n1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:41.520\n We don't know.\n\n1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:43.240\n Exactly.\n\n1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:45.800\n So he has this.\n\n1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:47.360\n And even though this is the scene.\n\n1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:50.640\n Yeah, you keeping that in mind, all of this in mind.\n\n1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:51.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:53.840\n What about like, can you give an inkling\n\n1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:56.640\n of other parts of the process, like the editing?\n\n1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:58.120\n Like where does the magic happen?\n\n1:10:58.120 --> 1:10:58.920\n Another thing.\n\n1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:02.120\n Pedro, I don't pronounce Pedro last name right.\n\n1:11:02.120 --> 1:11:02.920\n He's a cool guy.\n\n1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:04.680\n I had a chance to play rugby with him.\n\n1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:06.160\n He was on, was he on my team?\n\n1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:06.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:08.320\n We were in both teams.\n\n1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:15.520\n But Pedro, the editor who edited many great films,\n\n1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:24.040\n once again, he has, I will call, deciphering power.\n\n1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:27.520\n A good editor is a decipher, almost like breaking\n\n1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:33.960\n the enigma, because he's dealing with thousands,\n\n1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:36.760\n or we'll call it a film, with millions of feet of film,\n\n1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:38.000\n at least a million feet of film.\n\n1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.600\n That's a lot of film for a feature.\n\n1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.920\n He's dealing with that.\n\n1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:47.080\n But he's dealing with multiple cameras.\n\n1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:48.720\n So it ain't like it's like two cameras.\n\n1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:50.840\n He got an A, B, and he could just go back.\n\n1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:51.880\n No.\n\n1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:54.480\n He may have six cameras, and he has to go back\n\n1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:56.160\n and deal with that process.\n\n1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:58.480\n And you know what?\n\n1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.120\n He knows how to tell the story again.\n\n1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:06.000\n And he proved it on American Gangster\n\n1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:11.200\n as me being a witness, because it's so much information.\n\n1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:14.280\n Even when the brothers all start getting their little business\n\n1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:16.240\n and then he put one in the Bronx,\n\n1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:21.880\n he just captured every neighborhood within one minute,\n\n1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:23.320\n and you knew what would happen.\n\n1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:24.400\n You knew it all.\n\n1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:26.560\n You saw the whole rise of fame.\n\n1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:29.240\n You watched the Palmer and Scarface,\n\n1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:34.200\n who does it in two minutes, but it's only one character.\n\n1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:35.520\n So you see him go to the bank.\n\n1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:36.560\n He drops the money off.\n\n1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:37.760\n You see him buy the lion.\n\n1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:39.920\n You see him gets his wife, or the tiger.\n\n1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:41.840\n You see him gets his wife, you see all that.\n\n1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:44.840\n And then it ends on the big side of him in a big house\n\n1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:46.680\n with all the TV screens.\n\n1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:49.160\n And you seen him go through it, right?\n\n1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:50.720\n But in American Gangster, you're going\n\n1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:53.360\n to tell that story of rising, but you also got\n\n1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:54.920\n to include these five brothers.\n\n1:12:54.920 --> 1:12:56.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:57.880\n And that's all in the edit.\n\n1:12:57.880 --> 1:12:58.680\n Oh, man.\n\n1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:02.560\n But also all in the director knowing that as well.\n\n1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:05.200\n And you got to keep thinking about them, because that\n\n1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:06.520\n was a story right there.\n\n1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:07.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:08.840\n While I was hearing it, I don't know\n\n1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.200\n if they was taking pictures of him,\n\n1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:12.920\n or they might have a little party over there.\n\n1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:13.720\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:15.360\n Chess, I think.\n\n1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:16.760\n Yeah, I like it.\n\n1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:19.720\n They're playing chess in the distance.\n\n1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:22.720\n This is great.\n\n1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:26.000\n You said that you were always an old soul\n\n1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.240\n and see the world as if you're 200 years old.\n\n1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:29.480\n I like this line.\n\n1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:31.200\n Because your creative vision allows\n\n1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.800\n you to see the final piece you've created,\n\n1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:38.400\n or you're creating very quickly, quicker than others.\n\n1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.280\n I heard that as if you've almost lived many lives.\n\n1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:45.560\n You have this experience that allows you to see the vision.\n\n1:13:45.560 --> 1:13:47.880\n So let me ask you on creativity, where\n\n1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:51.080\n does this creativity behind RZA come from,\n\n1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:54.600\n both musically and film wise?\n\n1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:57.520\n I don't know if I have the answer to that one, right?\n\n1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:00.040\n Seriously, where does it come from?\n\n1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:02.080\n Only thing I could say about that\n\n1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:07.840\n is that for some reason, it seems endless.\n\n1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:13.680\n And that's peculiar when I think about it myself,\n\n1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:20.040\n because I was taught a lot of things from the JZA.\n\n1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:22.120\n He introduced me to mathematics.\n\n1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:27.120\n He introduced me to hip hop itself, to break dancing.\n\n1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:31.080\n I got other cousins that introduced me to graffiti,\n\n1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:34.240\n cousins that introduced me to DJing.\n\n1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:37.000\n I realized that I had a lot of introductions,\n\n1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.880\n but the JZA definitely, my older cousin,\n\n1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:44.440\n gave me a lot of early inspirations.\n\n1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:50.160\n And not saying that he's not creative,\n\n1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:55.480\n as creative as he was then or now,\n\n1:14:55.480 --> 1:15:00.680\n the wide span of creativity, I don't see him doing that,\n\n1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:02.600\n right?\n\n1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:06.960\n And I don't see the cousins that taught me how to DJ.\n\n1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:13.280\n I didn't see them move from DJing to making the beats.\n\n1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:20.600\n My cousin who actually got me into instruments,\n\n1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:25.040\n I didn't see him leave funk and rock.\n\n1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:27.480\n I'm an orchestra composer now.\n\n1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:35.840\n So I just said to myself, I just accept myself as an artist,\n\n1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:37.000\n as a creative artist.\n\n1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.120\n That's what I am.\n\n1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:40.400\n I have to accept that.\n\n1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:43.120\n Now, where it comes from, I don't know.\n\n1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:45.680\n If I was to try to say where it comes from,\n\n1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:48.520\n like, hey, give me some type of answer,\n\n1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:50.680\n I would say from life itself.\n\n1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:51.640\n But what does it feel like?\n\n1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:53.520\n Because you mentioned during this pandemic,\n\n1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:55.600\n for example, for some reason, more\n\n1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:57.840\n came to you in terms of writing.\n\n1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:00.800\n And so do you feel like you're just receiving signals\n\n1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:05.000\n from elsewhere, or do you feel like it's hard work,\n\n1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.200\n or you're just waiting?\n\n1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:07.920\n Wow.\n\n1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:10.720\n It's not even waiting, nor is it hard work.\n\n1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:13.600\n It's almost like I said in one of my other lyrics,\n\n1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:15.560\n this is for the MC part of it.\n\n1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:19.720\n I said, MCing to me is easy as breathing.\n\n1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:20.920\n So it's like breathing.\n\n1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:23.960\n Yeah, it's just like, in fact, there's\n\n1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:26.400\n actually was a scientific thing I read about that.\n\n1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:28.000\n Now that you've said that.\n\n1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:28.560\n You heard this?\n\n1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:30.080\n I know you've had to hear this.\n\n1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:37.400\n They say that the atoms in our atmosphere, which\n\n1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:41.760\n seem to be infinite in number, are not infinite\n\n1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:44.560\n in the space they occupy.\n\n1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:48.200\n Because they're in our atmosphere.\n\n1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:52.720\n And so there's a chance that at least 1 million atoms\n\n1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:58.240\n that you breathe in your life was breathed by Galileo.\n\n1:16:58.240 --> 1:16:59.480\n You heard this before, right?\n\n1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:00.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.840\n OK.\n\n1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:04.120\n It's very accurate.\n\n1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:05.120\n OK.\n\n1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:07.240\n How does your body digest it?\n\n1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:15.640\n Oh, let's start at the fact that most of the atoms that we're\n\n1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:18.440\n made of is from stars, right?\n\n1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:19.080\n Stars burst.\n\n1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:22.640\n So we're all really connected fundamentally somehow.\n\n1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:25.960\n And then the atoms that make up our body come and leave.\n\n1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:28.080\n And the same with the cells that are in our body,\n\n1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:29.520\n they die and are reborn.\n\n1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:31.520\n And we don't pay attention to any of that.\n\n1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:33.320\n That all just goes through us.\n\n1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:33.960\n I don't know.\n\n1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:41.960\n That makes me feel like I'm not an individual.\n\n1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:45.600\n I'm just a finger of something much bigger,\n\n1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:47.560\n some much bigger organism.\n\n1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:51.760\n Well, because you're drinking the coffee there, right?\n\n1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:54.240\n You're going to digest that.\n\n1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:56.880\n You're going to digest those atoms,\n\n1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.880\n whether you're going to put them through the bowel\n\n1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:00.680\n or through the urination, it's coming out.\n\n1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:01.800\n Or maybe you'll sweat it out.\n\n1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:02.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:03.360\n You might sneeze it out.\n\n1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:04.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:05.640\n But they're going to make their way out.\n\n1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:10.040\n How do you digest the atoms if you just breathe in Galileo?\n\n1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:11.400\n Right?\n\n1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:14.560\n And that's what I think an artist does.\n\n1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:16.360\n I think something in the artist, it's\n\n1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:18.560\n like some people eat things and they're going to gain weight.\n\n1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:19.680\n Some people ain't going to gain weight.\n\n1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:22.240\n They're going to gain muscle.\n\n1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:23.640\n I'll just give you an analogy here.\n\n1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:28.800\n I'm thinking that the artist breathes in and translates it\n\n1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:29.680\n into the art.\n\n1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:30.800\n First, they got to hear it.\n\n1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:33.960\n I think most of us don't hear that.\n\n1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:35.760\n We receive it, but it just doesn't come out.\n\n1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:37.640\n Yeah, we not have the frequency.\n\n1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:40.440\n I said this to a lot of artists.\n\n1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:42.800\n And even we all can consider ourselves artists\n\n1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:44.960\n in a certain way.\n\n1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:50.240\n But let's just say there's only one million artists\n\n1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:51.920\n in the world.\n\n1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:53.920\n Good.\n\n1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:57.520\n Because it's probably 10.\n\n1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:01.400\n If you divide that into the population,\n\n1:19:01.400 --> 1:19:03.200\n what part of the table would it be?\n\n1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:04.160\n The tiny part.\n\n1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:07.760\n It might be that, right?\n\n1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:11.880\n And yet, it's that that inspires that.\n\n1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:13.960\n And you know what's so crazy about that, though?\n\n1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:15.320\n There's also a chance.\n\n1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:18.120\n I'm just going numbers and I'm just hypothesizing with you.\n\n1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:22.440\n But there's also a chance that all of this\n\n1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:24.240\n is actually informing that.\n\n1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:26.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:29.760\n The artist is just watching this, all of this,\n\n1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:32.040\n all the chaos of this.\n\n1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:34.600\n Yeah, so it's hard to know where the beauty comes from.\n\n1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:36.680\n Is it the artist or the chaos from the?\n\n1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:39.240\n So I just say I don't have the answer.\n\n1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:41.960\n But if I was to be forced to say an answer,\n\n1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:44.200\n and you're not twisting my arm, but I'll say.\n\n1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:45.240\n I can if you want me to.\n\n1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:46.080\n No, thank you.\n\n1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:48.280\n I'll say life.\n\n1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:51.480\n Yeah, life.\n\n1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:54.920\n In Tao of Wu, you write something about confusion,\n\n1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:56.120\n which I really like.\n\n1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:58.640\n Confusion is a gift from God.\n\n1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:01.800\n Those times when you feel most desperate for a solution,\n\n1:20:01.800 --> 1:20:03.840\n sit, wait.\n\n1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:06.040\n The information will become clear.\n\n1:20:06.040 --> 1:20:08.680\n The confusion is there to guide you.\n\n1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:12.480\n Seek detachment and become the producer of your life.\n\n1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:15.560\n So I got to ask you advice.\n\n1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:20.000\n If a young person today in high school, college\n\n1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000\n is looking for some advice, what advice\n\n1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.880\n could you give them to be a producer of a life\n\n1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:26.080\n that can be proud of?\n\n1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:29.320\n Read the Tao of Wu.\n\n1:20:29.320 --> 1:20:31.320\n Let's start with the Wu Tang manual first.\n\n1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:32.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:33.280\n No, you could do that second.\n\n1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:34.080\n Second?\n\n1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:34.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.400\n I think you could read the Tao of Wu first\n\n1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:37.800\n and then do the manual.\n\n1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:41.600\n Because the manual is not to put the two books against each\n\n1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:43.800\n other, but the manual is talking about things\n\n1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:47.280\n that is so deeply connected to the music.\n\n1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:51.200\n And the people in the Tao of Wu goes beyond that.\n\n1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:56.640\n So I would actually start there, which is not normally\n\n1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:57.600\n what I would prescribe.\n\n1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:00.360\n I always tell people, start in knowledge, then go to wisdom.\n\n1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:01.200\n But since the Tao of Wu.\n\n1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:02.240\n Skip ahead to the wisdom.\n\n1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:03.040\n I like it.\n\n1:21:03.040 --> 1:21:06.120\n Yeah, I think for a young man in high school,\n\n1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:08.960\n go to the Tao of Wu and then go back.\n\n1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:13.520\n It's just like sometimes you have my son's generation,\n\n1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:17.000\n they have to watch the second round of Star Wars.\n\n1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:17.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:19.160\n And then they go back.\n\n1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:19.960\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:21:19.960 --> 1:21:22.600\n This generation is watching The Force Awakens.\n\n1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:23.400\n And then they go back.\n\n1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:24.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:29.760\n But what, because if you just look at your life as an example,\n\n1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:31.840\n that's one heck of a life.\n\n1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:33.720\n There's very few lives like it.\n\n1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:36.160\n You've created some of the most incredible things\n\n1:21:36.160 --> 1:21:38.240\n artistically in this world.\n\n1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:43.000\n Like if somebody, you talk about that like 1 million, right?\n\n1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.680\n At the corner of the table.\n\n1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:49.040\n If somebody wants, strives, dreams to become one of those,\n\n1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:50.480\n how do they do it?\n\n1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:53.560\n Well, the beautiful thing is that there\n\n1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:58.200\n are footprints left by those who've done it.\n\n1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:02.400\n And the best way is to study that.\n\n1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:05.000\n To study those who've already done what you want to do.\n\n1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:10.480\n We live on a civilization.\n\n1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:13.280\n As we said, this is the greatest country in the world.\n\n1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:17.160\n But our seal is a pyramid with an I on it.\n\n1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:17.960\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:19.640\n Because they did it before.\n\n1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:22.400\n And they may have failed for some reason\n\n1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:24.200\n or something happens.\n\n1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:29.000\n But it was just a strong enough example to take us further.\n\n1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.840\n Elon Musk is sitting here trying to do better than what\n\n1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:33.800\n the rocket builders did before.\n\n1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:36.200\n He's not the first one to build the rocket.\n\n1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:39.000\n He's not the first guy to think of with the electric car.\n\n1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.320\n He's doing it better.\n\n1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:43.760\n He's advancing it to the point that whoever\n\n1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:45.560\n picks up after him, maybe they'll\n\n1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:47.640\n get to that flying car.\n\n1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:51.280\n So that's the beauty.\n\n1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:52.440\n There's a good verse.\n\n1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:55.360\n I love finding verses to say things to confirm.\n\n1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:59.440\n Because this way, people could take it verbally, physically,\n\n1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:01.160\n and then maybe even spiritually.\n\n1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:02.560\n But Christmas has said a verse.\n\n1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:05.920\n He said, the fastest way to heaven\n\n1:23:05.920 --> 1:23:08.520\n is by spending time or studying the wise people.\n\n1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:10.360\n Meaning the wise people who are living\n\n1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:13.080\n and those who live before you.\n\n1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:14.760\n Study the masters.\n\n1:23:14.760 --> 1:23:17.280\n Let me ask you a big, perhaps ridiculous question,\n\n1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:18.680\n but give it a shot.\n\n1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:20.240\n What is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:23.240\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:24.280\n Big question.\n\n1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:25.720\n I'm not going to rush into the answer.\n\n1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:33.120\n I'm going to give you somebody else's answer first,\n\n1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:34.920\n and I'll give you my answer.\n\n1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:42.000\n I remember asking this when I was 15, 16 years old.\n\n1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:45.960\n One of the brothers was studying in mathematics.\n\n1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:55.240\n And the letter I itself means I Islam.\n\n1:23:55.240 --> 1:24:02.920\n I meaning the individual being in total accord with Islam.\n\n1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:03.960\n And let me finish this.\n\n1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:05.800\n Then they took the word Islam, and they\n\n1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:13.240\n defined it as Islam is an Arabic word for peace.\n\n1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:20.120\n Then they said, peace is the absence of confusion.\n\n1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:21.560\n OK?\n\n1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:23.840\n So then they took them.\n\n1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:26.560\n This is something that really hit me when I never forgot it.\n\n1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:28.680\n And I'm going to decipher it.\n\n1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:31.160\n But then they took the word Islam,\n\n1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:34.920\n and they broke it down by the letter into an acronym,\n\n1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:37.200\n like cash, with everything around me.\n\n1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:45.840\n And they broke it down to I stimulate light and matter.\n\n1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:48.600\n And I was like, what?\n\n1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.280\n Because what hit me is that if you're not here,\n\n1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:55.120\n then light and matter don't exist to you.\n\n1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:59.160\n So you're stimulating it, or it ain't here for you.\n\n1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:00.280\n So anyway, taking all that.\n\n1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:03.840\n But then I said, so what's the meaning of life?\n\n1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:06.760\n And the brothers just said, love Islam forever.\n\n1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:07.560\n Right?\n\n1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:08.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:12.840\n And I said, I ain't saying the religious point of it.\n\n1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:14.400\n I'm just saying all those other elements\n\n1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:15.800\n I just spoke about in front of it.\n\n1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:17.880\n I stimulate light and matter.\n\n1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:18.560\n I love that.\n\n1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:20.840\n That's powerful.\n\n1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:24.960\n And let me give you my definition of life.\n\n1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:30.520\n I think life is simply for each and every one of us\n\n1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:33.440\n to add on to.\n\n1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:34.120\n Build.\n\n1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.320\n Like you said, the masters.\n\n1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:37.360\n Build on top.\n\n1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:38.520\n Life gave you life.\n\n1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:41.600\n Give life back.\n\n1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:43.720\n I don't think there's a better way to end it than talking\n\n1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:44.800\n about the meaning of life.\n\n1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:46.640\n RZA, I'm a huge fan.\n\n1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:48.800\n It's such a huge honor that you spend your valuable time\n\n1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:49.320\n with me.\n\n1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:50.120\n Thank you so much.\n\n1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:50.920\n Thank you for inviting me.\n\n1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:52.400\n Peace.\n\n1:25:52.400 --> 1:25:55.240\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with RZA.\n\n1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:58.000\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.440\n in the description.\n\n1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:03.160\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Plato.\n\n1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:08.240\n Poetry is nearer to vital truth than history.\n\n1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:23.320\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
