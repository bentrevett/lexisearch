BASIC, yeah, on an Atari 800,\n\n01:23.320 --> 01:26.840\n Atari 400, I think, or maybe it was an Atari 800.\n\n01:26.840 --> 01:28.300\n It was a part of a class,\n\n01:28.300 --> 01:32.560\n and we just were just BASIC loops to print things out.\n\n01:32.560 --> 01:34.920\n Did you use go to statements?\n\n01:34.920 --> 01:38.000\n Yes, yes, we used go to statements.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:39.560\n I remember in the early days,\n\n01:39.560 --> 01:41.160\n that's when I first realized\n\n01:41.160 --> 01:43.320\n there's like principles to programming,\n\n01:43.320 --> 01:45.720\n when I was told that don't use go to statements.\n\n01:45.720 --> 01:48.080\n Those are bad software engineering principles,\n\n01:48.080 --> 01:52.040\n like it goes against what great, beautiful code is.\n\n01:52.040 --> 01:54.800\n I was like, oh, okay, there's rules to this game.\n\n01:54.800 --> 01:56.240\n I didn't see that until high school\n\n01:56.240 --> 01:58.360\n when I took an AP computer science course.\n\n01:58.360 --> 02:02.200\n I did a lot of other kinds of just programming in TI,\n\n02:02.200 --> 02:04.160\n but finally, when I took an AP computer science course\n\n02:04.160 --> 02:05.720\n in Pascal.\n\n02:05.720 --> 02:06.560\n Wow.\n\n02:06.560 --> 02:07.440\n That's, yeah, it was Pascal.\n\n02:07.440 --> 02:09.760\n That's when I, oh, there are these principles.\n\n02:09.760 --> 02:11.320\n Not C or C++?\n\n02:11.320 --> 02:14.660\n No, I didn't take C until the next year in college.\n\n02:14.660 --> 02:18.100\n I had a course in C, but I haven't done much in Pascal,\n\n02:18.100 --> 02:20.160\n just that AP computer science course.\n\n02:20.160 --> 02:23.480\n Now, sorry for the romanticized question,\n\n02:23.480 --> 02:26.720\n but when did you first fall in love with programming?\n\n02:26.720 --> 02:27.880\n Oh, man, good question.\n\n02:27.880 --> 02:30.280\n I think actually when I was 10,\n\n02:30.280 --> 02:33.460\n my dad got us a TI Timex Sinclair,\n\n02:33.460 --> 02:37.200\n and he was excited about the spreadsheet capability,\n\n02:37.200 --> 02:39.560\n and then, but I made him get the basic,\n\n02:39.560 --> 02:41.840\n the add ons we could actually program in basic,\n\n02:41.840 --> 02:44.520\n and just being able to write instructions\n\n02:44.520 --> 02:45.960\n and have the computer do something.\n\n02:45.960 --> 02:50.080\n Then we got a TI 994A when I was about 12,\n\n02:50.080 --> 02:52.960\n and I would just, it had sprites and graphics and music.\n\n02:52.960 --> 02:55.320\n You could actually program it to do music.\n\n02:55.320 --> 02:58.600\n That's when I really sort of fell in love with programming.\n\n02:58.600 --> 03:01.060\n So this is a full, like a real computer\n\n03:01.060 --> 03:04.120\n with like, with memory and storage,\n\n03:04.120 --> 03:05.240\n processors and whatnot,\n\n03:05.240 --> 03:07.360\n because you say TI. Yeah, the Timex Sinclair\n\n03:07.360 --> 03:09.680\n was one of the very first, it was a cheap, cheap,\n\n03:09.680 --> 03:12.760\n like, I think it was, well, it was still expensive,\n\n03:12.760 --> 03:14.440\n but it was 2K of memory.\n\n03:14.440 --> 03:16.760\n We got the 16K add on pack,\n\n03:16.760 --> 03:19.000\n but yeah, it had memory, and you could program it.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.920\n You had the, in order to store your programs,\n\n03:20.920 --> 03:22.880\n you had to attach a tape drive.\n\n03:22.880 --> 03:24.400\n Remember that old, the sound that would play\n\n03:24.400 --> 03:29.400\n when you converted the modems would convert digital bits\n\n03:29.440 --> 03:31.920\n to audio files set on a tape drive.\n\n03:31.920 --> 03:34.760\n Still remember that sound, but that was the storage.\n\n03:34.760 --> 03:36.480\n And what was the programming language, do you remember?\n\n03:36.480 --> 03:37.320\n It was basic. It was basic.\n\n03:37.320 --> 03:38.980\n And then they had a VisiCalc,\n\n03:38.980 --> 03:40.600\n and so a little bit of spreadsheet programming\n\n03:40.600 --> 03:42.760\n in VisiCalc, but mostly just some basic.\n\n03:42.760 --> 03:46.340\n Do you remember what kind of things drew you to programming?\n\n03:46.340 --> 03:50.360\n Was it working with data, was it video games?\n\n03:50.360 --> 03:52.600\n Games, math, mathy stuff?\n\n03:52.600 --> 03:54.800\n Yeah, I've always loved math,\n\n03:54.800 --> 03:58.080\n and a lot of people think they don't like math\n\n03:58.080 --> 04:00.440\n because I think when they're exposed to it early,\n\n04:00.440 --> 04:02.080\n it's about memory.\n\n04:02.080 --> 04:03.260\n When you're exposed to math early,\n\n04:03.260 --> 04:04.280\n you have a good short term memory,\n\n04:04.280 --> 04:05.920\n can remember his timetables.\n\n04:05.920 --> 04:08.600\n And I do have a reasonably, I mean, not perfect,\n\n04:08.600 --> 04:12.480\n but a reasonably long little short term memory buffer.\n\n04:12.480 --> 04:14.320\n And so I did great at timetables.\n\n04:14.320 --> 04:15.840\n I said, oh, I'm good at math.\n\n04:15.840 --> 04:17.360\n But I started to really like math,\n\n04:17.360 --> 04:20.320\n just the problem solving aspect.\n\n04:20.320 --> 04:25.040\n And so computing was problem solving applied.\n\n04:25.040 --> 04:28.280\n And so that's always kind of been the draw,\n\n04:28.280 --> 04:30.480\n kind of coupled with the mathematics.\n\n04:30.480 --> 04:33.920\n Did you ever see the computer as like an extension\n\n04:33.920 --> 04:36.520\n of your mind, like something able to achieve?\n\n04:36.520 --> 04:37.760\n Not till later.\n\n04:37.760 --> 04:38.600\n Okay.\n\n04:38.600 --> 04:39.440\n Yeah, not then.\n\n04:39.440 --> 04:40.880\n It's just like a little set of puzzles\n\n04:40.880 --> 04:43.520\n that you can play with and you can play with math puzzles.\n\n04:43.520 --> 04:46.120\n Yeah, it was too rudimentary early on.\n\n04:46.120 --> 04:49.160\n Like it was sort of, yeah, it was a lot of work\n\n04:49.160 --> 04:51.440\n to actually take a thought you'd have\n\n04:51.440 --> 04:53.120\n and actually get it implemented.\n\n04:53.120 --> 04:56.020\n And that's still work, but it's getting easier.\n\n04:56.020 --> 04:58.240\n And so yeah, I would say that's definitely\n\n04:58.240 --> 04:59.560\n what's attracting me to Python\n\n04:59.560 --> 05:02.140\n is that that was more real, right?\n\n05:02.140 --> 05:04.840\n I could think in Python.\n\n05:04.840 --> 05:05.800\n Speaking of foreign language,\n\n05:05.800 --> 05:08.400\n I only speak another language fluently besides English,\n\n05:08.400 --> 05:09.220\n which is Spanish.\n\n05:09.220 --> 05:11.720\n And I remember the day when I would dream in Spanish\n\n05:11.720 --> 05:13.440\n and you start to think in that language.\n\n05:13.440 --> 05:15.340\n And then you actually, I do definitely believe\n\n05:15.340 --> 05:19.640\n that language limits or expands your thinking.\n\n05:19.640 --> 05:21.600\n There's some languages that actually lead you\n\n05:21.600 --> 05:23.860\n to certain thought processes.\n\n05:23.860 --> 05:27.280\n Yeah, like, so I speak Russian fluently\n\n05:27.280 --> 05:30.960\n and that's certainly a language that leads you\n\n05:30.960 --> 05:33.240\n down certain thought processes.\n\n05:33.240 --> 05:36.220\n Well, yeah, I mean, there's a history\n\n05:36.220 --> 05:41.220\n of the two world wars of millions of people starving\n\n05:41.220 --> 05:44.180\n to death or near to death throughout its history\n\n05:44.180 --> 05:48.020\n of suffering, of injustice, like this promise sold\n\n05:48.020 --> 05:50.900\n to the people and then the carpet\n\n05:50.900 --> 05:53.340\n or whatever is swept from under them.\n\n05:53.340 --> 05:54.660\n And it's like broken promises.\n\n05:54.660 --> 05:58.100\n And all of that pain and melancholy is in the language,\n\n05:58.100 --> 06:01.700\n the sad songs, the sad hopeful songs,\n\n06:01.700 --> 06:05.260\n the over romanticized, like, I love you, I hate you,\n\n06:05.260 --> 06:09.980\n the sort of the swings between all the various spectrums\n\n06:09.980 --> 06:13.740\n of emotion, so that's all within the language.\n\n06:13.740 --> 06:18.020\n The way it's twisted, there's a strong culture\n\n06:18.020 --> 06:20.380\n of rhyming poetry, so like the bards,\n\n06:20.380 --> 06:24.740\n like the sync, there's a musicality to the language too.\n\n06:24.740 --> 06:27.380\n Did Dostoevsky write in Russian?\n\n06:27.380 --> 06:30.180\n Yeah, so like Dostoevsky, Tostoy, all the,\n\n06:32.100 --> 06:32.940\n all the.\n\n06:32.940 --> 06:34.660\n The ones that I know about, which are translated\n\n06:34.660 --> 06:36.340\n and I'm curious how the translations.\n\n06:36.340 --> 06:40.860\n So Dostoevsky did not use the musicality\n\n06:40.860 --> 06:42.180\n of the language too much.\n\n06:42.180 --> 06:44.180\n So it actually translates pretty well\n\n06:44.180 --> 06:46.540\n because it's so philosophically dense\n\n06:46.540 --> 06:48.460\n that the story does a lot of the work,\n\n06:48.460 --> 06:51.140\n but there's a bunch of things that are untranslatable.\n\n06:51.140 --> 06:53.580\n Certainly the poetry is not translatable.\n\n06:53.580 --> 06:57.940\n I actually have a few conversations coming up offline\n\n06:57.940 --> 06:59.980\n and also in this podcast with people\n\n06:59.980 --> 07:01.940\n who've translated Dostoevsky.\n\n07:01.940 --> 07:06.340\n And that's for people who worked, who work in this field,\n\n07:06.340 --> 07:07.340\n know how difficult that is.\n\n07:07.340 --> 07:10.660\n Sometimes you can spend months thinking\n\n07:10.660 --> 07:12.340\n about a single sentence, right?\n\n07:12.340 --> 07:15.220\n In context, like, cause there's just the magic\n\n07:15.220 --> 07:17.860\n captured by that sentence and how do you translate\n\n07:17.860 --> 07:18.940\n just in the right way?\n\n07:18.940 --> 07:22.380\n Because those words can be really powerful.\n\n07:22.380 --> 07:24.300\n There's a famous line,\n\n07:24.300 --> 07:27.140\n beauty will save the world from Dostoevsky.\n\n07:27.140 --> 07:29.500\n You know, there's so many ways to translate that.\n\n07:29.500 --> 07:32.700\n And you're right, the language gives you the tools\n\n07:32.700 --> 07:34.140\n with which to tell the story,\n\n07:34.140 --> 07:37.260\n but it also leads your mind down certain trajectories\n\n07:37.260 --> 07:39.660\n and paths to where over time,\n\n07:39.660 --> 07:41.140\n as you think in that language,\n\n07:41.140 --> 07:42.740\n you become a different human being.\n\n07:42.740 --> 07:43.740\n Yes. Yeah.\n\n07:43.740 --> 07:45.860\n Yeah, that's a fascinating reality, I think.\n\n07:45.860 --> 07:47.020\n I know people have explored that,\n\n07:47.020 --> 07:49.740\n but it's just rediscovered.\n\n07:49.740 --> 07:52.340\n Well, we don't, we live in our own like little pockets.\n\n07:52.340 --> 07:56.860\n Like this is the sad thing is I feel like unfortunately,\n\n07:56.860 --> 07:59.140\n given time and given getting older,\n\n07:59.140 --> 08:03.620\n I'll never know China, the Chinese world,\n\n08:03.620 --> 08:05.780\n because I don't truly know the language.\n\n08:05.780 --> 08:08.300\n Same with Japanese, I don't truly know Japanese\n\n08:08.300 --> 08:10.340\n and Portuguese and Brazil,\n\n08:10.340 --> 08:12.060\n that whole South American continent.\n\n08:12.060 --> 08:14.460\n Like, yeah, I'll go to Brazil and Argentina,\n\n08:14.460 --> 08:17.100\n but will I truly understand the people\n\n08:17.100 --> 08:18.500\n if I don't understand the language?\n\n08:18.500 --> 08:23.500\n It's sad because I wonder how much,\n\n08:23.500 --> 08:25.220\n how many geniuses were missing\n\n08:25.220 --> 08:28.540\n because so much of the scientific world,\n\n08:28.540 --> 08:31.460\n so much of the technical world is in English,\n\n08:31.460 --> 08:33.140\n and so much of it might be lost\n\n08:33.140 --> 08:36.100\n because it's just we don't have the common language.\n\n08:36.100 --> 08:36.940\n I completely agree.\n\n08:36.940 --> 08:40.620\n I'm very much in that vein of there's a lot of genius\n\n08:40.620 --> 08:41.780\n out there that we miss,\n\n08:41.780 --> 08:45.060\n and it's sort of fortunate when it bubbles up\n\n08:45.060 --> 08:48.700\n into something that we can understand or process,\n\n08:48.700 --> 08:50.420\n there's a lot we miss.\n\n08:50.420 --> 08:54.060\n So I tend to lean towards really loving democratization\n\n08:54.060 --> 08:55.420\n or things that empower people\n\n08:55.420 --> 09:00.140\n or very resistant sort of authoritarian structures.\n\n09:00.140 --> 09:01.900\n Fundamentally for that reason,\n\n09:01.900 --> 09:04.740\n well, several reasons, but it just hurts us.\n\n09:04.740 --> 09:06.420\n We're soft.\n\n09:06.420 --> 09:09.020\n So speaking of languages that empower you,\n\n09:09.020 --> 09:11.820\n so Python was the first language for me\n\n09:11.820 --> 09:16.780\n that I really enjoyed thinking in, as you said.\n\n09:16.780 --> 09:18.500\n Sounds like you shared my experience too.\n\n09:18.500 --> 09:19.620\n So when did you first,\n\n09:19.620 --> 09:21.900\n do you remember when you first kind of connected with Python,\n\n09:21.900 --> 09:23.740\n maybe even fell in love with Python?\n\n09:23.740 --> 09:24.580\n It's a good question.\n\n09:24.580 --> 09:25.500\n It was a process.\n\n09:25.500 --> 09:26.540\n It took about a year.\n\n09:26.540 --> 09:29.500\n I first encountered Python in 1997.\n\n09:29.500 --> 09:31.740\n I was a graduate student studying biomedical engineering\n\n09:31.740 --> 09:32.980\n at the Mayo Clinic.\n\n09:32.980 --> 09:34.700\n And I had previously,\n\n09:34.700 --> 09:39.340\n I'd been involved in taking information from satellites.\n\n09:39.340 --> 09:41.340\n I was an electrical engineering student\n\n09:41.340 --> 09:42.660\n used to taking information\n\n09:42.660 --> 09:44.060\n and trying to get something out of it,\n\n09:44.060 --> 09:46.140\n doing some data processing, getting information out of it.\n\n09:46.140 --> 09:47.660\n And I'd done that in MATLAB.\n\n09:47.660 --> 09:49.140\n I'd done that in Perl.\n\n09:49.140 --> 09:52.540\n I'd done that in scripting on a VMS.\n\n09:52.540 --> 09:54.260\n There's actually a VAX VMS system,\n\n09:54.260 --> 09:57.980\n they had their own little scripting tools around Fortran.\n\n09:57.980 --> 09:58.820\n Done a lot of that.\n\n09:58.820 --> 10:00.820\n And then as a graduate student,\n\n10:00.820 --> 10:04.420\n I was looking for something and encountered Python.\n\n10:04.420 --> 10:06.140\n And because Python had an array,\n\n10:06.140 --> 10:09.100\n had two things that made me not filter it away.\n\n10:09.100 --> 10:10.380\n Because I was filtering a bunch of stuff,\n\n10:10.380 --> 10:11.700\n as Yorick, I looked at Yorick,\n\n10:11.700 --> 10:14.420\n I looked at a few other languages that are out there\n\n10:14.420 --> 10:17.700\n at the time in 1997, but it had arrays.\n\n10:17.700 --> 10:19.060\n There's a library called Numeric\n\n10:19.060 --> 10:20.860\n that had just been written in 95,\n\n10:20.860 --> 10:23.740\n like not very, not too much earlier.\n\n10:23.740 --> 10:26.980\n By an MIT alum, Jim Huganen.\n\n10:26.980 --> 10:29.100\n You know, and I went back and read the mailing list\n\n10:29.100 --> 10:30.300\n to see the history of how it grew.\n\n10:30.300 --> 10:31.220\n And there was a very interesting,\n\n10:31.220 --> 10:32.380\n it's fascinating to do that actually,\n\n10:32.380 --> 10:36.020\n to see how this emergent cooperation,\n\n10:36.020 --> 10:39.500\n unstructured cooperation happens in the open source world\n\n10:39.500 --> 10:43.300\n that led to a lot of this collective programming,\n\n10:43.300 --> 10:45.140\n which is something maybe we might get into a little later,\n\n10:45.140 --> 10:46.100\n but what that looks like.\n\n10:46.100 --> 10:48.340\n What gap did Numeric fill?\n\n10:48.340 --> 10:50.260\n Numeric filled the gap of having an array object.\n\n10:50.260 --> 10:51.580\n There was no array object.\n\n10:51.580 --> 10:52.420\n There was no array.\n\n10:52.420 --> 10:55.380\n There was a one dimensional byte concept,\n\n10:55.380 --> 10:57.580\n but there was no n dimensional,\n\n10:57.580 --> 11:00.700\n two, three, four dimensional tensor they call it now.\n\n11:00.700 --> 11:03.260\n I'm still in the category that a tensor is another thing\n\n11:03.260 --> 11:05.220\n and it's just an ndarray we should call it,\n\n11:05.220 --> 11:07.180\n but kind of lost that battle.\n\n11:08.340 --> 11:10.140\n There's many battles in this world,\n\n11:10.140 --> 11:12.060\n some of which we win, some we lose.\n\n11:12.060 --> 11:13.620\n That's exactly right.\n\n11:13.620 --> 11:17.180\n So, but it had no math to it.\n\n11:17.180 --> 11:20.820\n So Numeric had math and a basic way to think in arrays.\n\n11:20.820 --> 11:21.820\n So I was looking for that,\n\n11:21.820 --> 11:23.620\n and it had complex numbers,\n\n11:24.980 --> 11:26.380\n a lot of programming languages.\n\n11:26.380 --> 11:28.100\n And you can see it because,\n\n11:28.100 --> 11:29.500\n if you're just a computer scientist,\n\n11:29.500 --> 11:32.060\n you think, ah, complex numbers are just two floats.\n\n11:32.060 --> 11:34.980\n So you can, people can build that on.\n\n11:34.980 --> 11:36.740\n But in practice, a complex number\n\n11:36.740 --> 11:38.980\n as one of the significant algebras\n\n11:38.980 --> 11:40.740\n that helps connect a lot of physical\n\n11:40.740 --> 11:42.260\n and mathematical ideas,\n\n11:42.260 --> 11:45.100\n particularly FFT for an electrical engineer.\n\n11:45.100 --> 11:48.160\n And it's a really important concept\n\n11:48.160 --> 11:50.820\n and not having it means you have to develop it\n\n11:50.820 --> 11:54.300\n several times and those times may not share an approach.\n\n11:54.300 --> 11:55.700\n One of the common things in programming,\n\n11:55.700 --> 11:59.060\n one of the things programming enables is abstractions.\n\n11:59.060 --> 12:01.180\n But when you have shared abstractions, it's even better.\n\n12:01.180 --> 12:02.980\n It sort of gets to the level of language\n\n12:02.980 --> 12:05.540\n of actually we all think of this the same way,\n\n12:05.540 --> 12:07.940\n which is both powerful and dangerous, right?\n\n12:07.940 --> 12:11.180\n Because powerful in that we now can quickly\n\n12:11.180 --> 12:13.340\n make bigger and higher level things\n\n12:13.340 --> 12:14.800\n on top of those abstractions dangerous\n\n12:14.800 --> 12:17.100\n because it also limits us as to the things\n\n12:17.100 --> 12:20.500\n we maybe left behind in producing that abstraction,\n\n12:20.500 --> 12:21.900\n which is at the heart of programming today\n\n12:21.900 --> 12:24.420\n and actually building around the programming world.\n\n12:24.420 --> 12:26.580\n I think it's a fascinating philosophical topic.\n\n12:26.580 --> 12:28.380\n Yeah, they will continue for many years, I think.\n\n12:28.380 --> 12:29.220\n They'll continue for many years.\n\n12:29.220 --> 12:31.260\n As we build more and more and more abstractions.\n\n12:31.260 --> 12:32.340\n Yes, I often think about, you know,\n\n12:32.340 --> 12:35.060\n we have a world that's built on these abstractions\n\n12:35.060 --> 12:37.500\n that were they the only ones possible?\n\n12:37.500 --> 12:39.860\n Certainly not, but they led to,\n\n12:39.860 --> 12:42.300\n you know, it's very hard to do it differently.\n\n12:42.300 --> 12:44.980\n Like there's an inertia that's very hard to,\n\n12:44.980 --> 12:47.740\n you know, push out, push away from.\n\n12:47.740 --> 12:49.640\n That has implications for things like,\n\n12:49.640 --> 12:50.720\n you know, the Julia language,\n\n12:50.720 --> 12:52.680\n which you have heard of, I'm sure.\n\n12:52.680 --> 12:55.700\n And I've met the creators and I liked Julia.\n\n12:55.700 --> 12:56.580\n It's a really cool language,\n\n12:56.580 --> 12:59.300\n but they struggled to kind of against the,\n\n12:59.300 --> 13:03.420\n just the tide of like this inertia of people using Python.\n\n13:03.420 --> 13:05.820\n And, you know, there's strategies to approach that,\n\n13:05.820 --> 13:07.580\n but nonetheless, it's a phenomena.\n\n13:07.580 --> 13:09.580\n And sometimes, so I love complex numbers\n\n13:09.580 --> 13:12.260\n and I love to raise, so I looked at Python.\n\n13:12.260 --> 13:15.260\n And then I had the experience, I did some stuff in Python\n\n13:15.260 --> 13:16.380\n and I was just doing my PhD.\n\n13:16.380 --> 13:19.700\n So I was out, my focus was on,\n\n13:19.700 --> 13:22.180\n I was actually doing a combination of MRI and ultrasound\n\n13:22.180 --> 13:24.740\n and looking at a phenomenon called elastography,\n\n13:24.740 --> 13:27.020\n which is you push waves into the body\n\n13:27.020 --> 13:30.300\n and observe those waves, like you can actually measure them.\n\n13:30.300 --> 13:32.780\n And then you do mathematical inversion\n\n13:32.780 --> 13:35.220\n to see what the elasticity is.\n\n13:35.220 --> 13:36.820\n And so that's the problem I was solving\n\n13:36.820 --> 13:39.780\n is how to do that with both ultrasound and MRI.\n\n13:39.780 --> 13:41.380\n I needed some tool to do that with.\n\n13:41.380 --> 13:44.260\n So I was starting to use Python in 97.\n\n13:44.260 --> 13:47.340\n In 98, I went back, looked at what I'd written\n\n13:47.340 --> 13:49.560\n and realized I could still understand it,\n\n13:49.560 --> 13:50.900\n which is not the experience I'd had\n\n13:50.900 --> 13:53.660\n when doing Perl in 95, right?\n\n13:53.660 --> 13:55.620\n I'd done the same thing and then I looked back\n\n13:55.620 --> 13:58.360\n and I forgotten what I was even saying.\n\n13:58.360 --> 14:00.700\n Now, you know, I'm not saying, so that may,\n\n14:00.700 --> 14:02.400\n hey, this may work, I like this.\n\n14:02.400 --> 14:04.980\n This is something I can retain\n\n14:04.980 --> 14:07.620\n without becoming an expert per se.\n\n14:07.620 --> 14:10.380\n And so that led me to go, I'm gonna push more into this.\n\n14:10.380 --> 14:14.820\n And then that 98 was kind of when I started\n\n14:14.820 --> 14:16.820\n to fall in love with Python, I would say.\n\n14:18.300 --> 14:20.900\n A few peculiar things about Python.\n\n14:20.900 --> 14:22.940\n So maybe compare it to Perl,\n\n14:22.940 --> 14:24.500\n compare it to some of the other languages.\n\n14:24.500 --> 14:26.320\n So there's no braces.\n\n14:26.320 --> 14:27.160\n Yeah.\n\n14:27.160 --> 14:31.960\n So space is used, indentation, I should say,\n\n14:31.960 --> 14:33.980\n is used as part of the language.\n\n14:33.980 --> 14:35.540\n Yeah, right.\n\n14:35.540 --> 14:39.980\n So did you, I mean, that's quite a leap.\n\n14:39.980 --> 14:41.180\n Were you comfortable with that leap\n\n14:41.180 --> 14:42.740\n or were you just very open minded?\n\n14:42.740 --> 14:43.580\n It's a good question.\n\n14:43.580 --> 14:48.040\n I was open minded, so I was cognizant of the concern.\n\n14:48.040 --> 14:52.060\n And it definitely has, it has specific challenges.\n\n14:52.060 --> 14:53.520\n You know, cut and pasting.\n\n14:53.520 --> 14:55.460\n For example, when you're cut and pasting code,\n\n14:55.460 --> 14:57.220\n and if your editors aren't supportive of that,\n\n14:57.220 --> 14:58.980\n if you're putting it into a terminal,\n\n14:58.980 --> 15:01.020\n and particularly in the past when terminals\n\n15:01.020 --> 15:03.140\n didn't necessarily have the intelligence to manage it now.\n\n15:03.140 --> 15:05.100\n Now, I, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks\n\n15:05.100 --> 15:06.820\n handle that just fine, so there's really no problem.\n\n15:06.820 --> 15:08.740\n But in the past, it created some challenges,\n\n15:08.740 --> 15:12.460\n formatting challenges, also mixed tabs and spaces.\n\n15:12.460 --> 15:14.740\n If editors weren't, you weren't clear\n\n15:14.740 --> 15:16.860\n on what was happening, you would have these issues.\n\n15:16.860 --> 15:19.180\n So there were really concrete reasons about it\n\n15:19.180 --> 15:20.400\n that I heard and understood.\n\n15:20.400 --> 15:23.960\n I never really encountered a problem with it personally.\n\n15:23.960 --> 15:26.480\n Like, it was occasional annoyances,\n\n15:26.480 --> 15:28.420\n but I really liked the fact\n\n15:28.420 --> 15:31.060\n that it didn't have all this extra characters, right?\n\n15:31.060 --> 15:33.100\n That these extra characters didn't show up\n\n15:33.100 --> 15:35.420\n in my visual field when I was just trying\n\n15:35.420 --> 15:38.000\n to process understanding a snippet of code.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.260\n Yeah, there's a cleanness to it.\n\n15:39.260 --> 15:41.140\n But, I mean, the idea is supposed to be\n\n15:41.140 --> 15:43.300\n that Perl also has a cleanness to it\n\n15:43.300 --> 15:46.500\n because of the minimalism of how many characters\n\n15:46.500 --> 15:48.420\n it takes to express a certain thing.\n\n15:48.420 --> 15:49.820\n So it's very compact.\n\n15:49.820 --> 15:52.300\n But what you realize with that compactness comes,\n\n15:53.560 --> 15:57.100\n there's a culture that prizes compactness,\n\n15:57.100 --> 15:58.900\n and so the code gets more and more compact\n\n15:58.900 --> 16:01.860\n and less and less readable to a point where it's like,\n\n16:03.600 --> 16:05.420\n like, to be a good programmer in Perl,\n\n16:05.420 --> 16:07.820\n you write code that's basically unreadable.\n\n16:07.820 --> 16:09.100\n There's a culture, like.\n\n16:09.100 --> 16:10.860\n Correct, and you're proud of it.\n\n16:10.860 --> 16:12.460\n Yeah, you're proud of it.\n\n16:12.460 --> 16:14.140\n Right, exactly, and it's like, feels good.\n\n16:14.140 --> 16:16.660\n And it's really selective.\n\n16:16.660 --> 16:20.380\n It means you have to be an expert in Perl to understand it.\n\n16:20.380 --> 16:22.980\n Whereas Python allowed you not to have to be an expert.\n\n16:22.980 --> 16:24.740\n You didn't have to take all this brain energy.\n\n16:24.740 --> 16:25.660\n You could leverage, what I say,\n\n16:25.660 --> 16:28.180\n you could leverage your English language center,\n\n16:28.180 --> 16:29.980\n which you're using all the time.\n\n16:29.980 --> 16:31.180\n I've wondered about other languages,\n\n16:31.180 --> 16:34.680\n particularly non Latin based languages.\n\n16:34.680 --> 16:37.220\n Latin based languages with the characters are at least similar.\n\n16:37.220 --> 16:38.620\n I think people have an easier time,\n\n16:38.620 --> 16:41.300\n but I don't know what it's like to be a Japanese\n\n16:41.300 --> 16:46.300\n or a Chinese person trying to learn different syntax.\n\n16:46.900 --> 16:49.740\n Like, what would computer programming look like in that?\n\n16:49.740 --> 16:50.780\n I haven't looked at that at all,\n\n16:50.780 --> 16:52.020\n but it certainly doesn't,\n\n16:52.020 --> 16:54.300\n you know, leveraging your Chinese language center,\n\n16:54.300 --> 16:57.060\n I'm not sure Python or any programming does that.\n\n16:57.060 --> 16:58.140\n But that was a big deal.\n\n16:58.140 --> 17:00.340\n The fact that it was accessible, I could be a scientist.\n\n17:00.340 --> 17:02.900\n What I really liked is many programming languages\n\n17:02.900 --> 17:04.740\n really demand a lot of you, and you can get a lot,\n\n17:04.740 --> 17:07.200\n you know, you do a lot if you learn it.\n\n17:07.200 --> 17:08.900\n But Python enables you to do a lot\n\n17:08.900 --> 17:11.180\n without demanding a lot of you.\n\n17:11.180 --> 17:13.100\n There's nuance to that statement,\n\n17:13.100 --> 17:15.340\n but it certainly was, it's more accessible.\n\n17:15.340 --> 17:18.040\n So more people could actually, as a scientist,\n\n17:18.040 --> 17:19.860\n as somebody who, or an engineer,\n\n17:19.860 --> 17:21.460\n who was trying to solve another problem\n\n17:21.460 --> 17:23.300\n besides point programming,\n\n17:23.300 --> 17:26.000\n I could still use this language and get things done\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.340\n and be happy about it.\n\n17:27.340 --> 17:30.100\n And I was also comfortable in C at that time.\n\n17:30.100 --> 17:31.340\n And MATLAB, you did a little bit of that.\n\n17:31.340 --> 17:33.180\n And MATLAB, I did a lot before that, exactly.\n\n17:33.180 --> 17:34.900\n So I was comfortable in,\n\n17:34.900 --> 17:37.580\n those three languages were really the tools I used\n\n17:37.580 --> 17:39.560\n during my studies and schooling.\n\n17:40.540 --> 17:42.620\n But to your point about language helping you think,\n\n17:42.620 --> 17:44.580\n one of the big things about MATLAB was it was,\n\n17:44.580 --> 17:48.300\n and APL before it, I don't know if you remember APL.\n\n17:48.300 --> 17:51.660\n APL is actually the predecessor of array based programming,\n\n17:51.660 --> 17:54.160\n which I think is really an underappreciated,\n\n17:54.160 --> 17:55.340\n if I talk to people who are just steeped\n\n17:55.340 --> 17:57.640\n in computer programming, computer science,\n\n17:57.640 --> 17:59.460\n like most of the people that Microsoft has hired\n\n17:59.460 --> 18:01.140\n in the past, for example,\n\n18:01.140 --> 18:03.900\n Microsoft as a company generally did not understand\n\n18:03.900 --> 18:05.220\n array based programming.\n\n18:05.220 --> 18:06.620\n Like culturally, they didn't understand it.\n\n18:06.620 --> 18:08.560\n So they kept missing the boat,\n\n18:08.560 --> 18:11.580\n kept missing the understanding of what this was.\n\n18:11.580 --> 18:12.740\n They've gotten better,\n\n18:12.740 --> 18:14.420\n but there's still a whole culture of folks\n\n18:14.420 --> 18:17.980\n that doesn't, programming, that's systems programming\n\n18:17.980 --> 18:20.380\n or web programming or lists and maps.\n\n18:20.380 --> 18:22.520\n And what about an n dimensional array?\n\n18:22.520 --> 18:24.700\n Oh yeah, that's just an implementation detail.\n\n18:24.700 --> 18:26.700\n Well, you can think that,\n\n18:26.700 --> 18:28.800\n but then actually if you have that as a construct,\n\n18:28.800 --> 18:29.860\n you actually think differently.\n\n18:29.860 --> 18:31.660\n APL was the first language to understand that.\n\n18:31.660 --> 18:33.460\n And it was in the sixties, right?\n\n18:33.460 --> 18:36.780\n The challenge of APL is APL had very dense,\n\n18:36.780 --> 18:39.340\n not only glyphs, like new characters, new glyphs,\n\n18:39.340 --> 18:40.480\n but they even had a new keyboard\n\n18:40.480 --> 18:42.340\n because to produce those glyphs,\n\n18:42.340 --> 18:43.980\n this is back in the early days in computing\n\n18:43.980 --> 18:47.980\n when the QWERTY keyboard maybe wasn't as established,\n\n18:47.980 --> 18:50.780\n like, well, we can have a new keyboard, no big deal.\n\n18:50.780 --> 18:52.860\n But it was a big deal and it didn't catch on.\n\n18:52.860 --> 18:56.500\n And the language APL, very much like Perl,\n\n18:56.500 --> 18:58.620\n as people would pride themselves on how much,\n\n18:58.620 --> 18:59.740\n could they write the game of life\n\n18:59.740 --> 19:03.100\n in 30 characters of APL.\n\n19:03.100 --> 19:06.060\n APL has characters that mean summation\n\n19:06.060 --> 19:08.180\n and they have adverbs,\n\n19:08.180 --> 19:10.060\n they would have adjectives and these things called adverbs,\n\n19:10.060 --> 19:12.220\n which are like methods, like reduction,\n\n19:12.220 --> 19:15.320\n reduction would be an adverb on an ad operator, right?\n\n19:15.320 --> 19:18.660\n So, but doing, using these tools you could construct\n\n19:18.660 --> 19:20.880\n and then you start to think at that level,\n\n19:20.880 --> 19:22.900\n you think in n dimensions is something I like to say,\n\n19:22.900 --> 19:25.500\n and you start to think differently about data at that point.\n\n19:25.500 --> 19:27.500\n Now you're, it really helps.\n\n19:27.500 --> 19:30.100\n Yeah, I mean, outside of programming,\n\n19:30.100 --> 19:33.700\n if you really internalize linear algebra as a course,\n\n19:33.700 --> 19:35.580\n I mean, it's philosophically allows you\n\n19:35.580 --> 19:37.220\n to think of the world differently.\n\n19:37.220 --> 19:39.700\n It's almost like liberating, you don't have to,\n\n19:39.700 --> 19:42.100\n you don't have to think about the individual numbers\n\n19:42.100 --> 19:44.240\n in the n dimensional array.\n\n19:44.240 --> 19:46.140\n You could think of it as an object in itself\n\n19:46.140 --> 19:48.500\n and all of a sudden this world can open up.\n\n19:48.500 --> 19:52.660\n You're saying MATLAB and APL were like the early C,\n\n19:52.660 --> 19:54.980\n I don't know if many languages got that right ever.\n\n19:54.980 --> 19:56.860\n No, no, no they didn't.\n\n19:56.860 --> 19:57.700\n Even still.\n\n19:57.700 --> 19:58.820\n Even still, I would say.\n\n19:58.820 --> 20:02.540\n I mean, NumPy is an inheritor of the traditions\n\n20:02.540 --> 20:06.580\n that I would say APLJ was another version that was,\n\n20:06.580 --> 20:08.340\n what it did is not have the glyphs,\n\n20:08.340 --> 20:09.700\n just have short characters,\n\n20:09.700 --> 20:11.740\n but still a Latin keyboard could type them.\n\n20:11.740 --> 20:14.540\n And then numeric inherited from that\n\n20:14.540 --> 20:17.660\n in terms of let's add arrays plus broadcasting\n\n20:17.660 --> 20:19.700\n plus methods, reduction,\n\n20:19.700 --> 20:21.780\n even some of the language like rank is a concept\n\n20:21.780 --> 20:24.660\n that was in Python and is still in Python\n\n20:24.660 --> 20:27.180\n for the number of dimensions, right?\n\n20:27.180 --> 20:29.460\n That's different than say the rank of a matrix\n\n20:29.460 --> 20:31.140\n which people think of as well.\n\n20:31.140 --> 20:33.060\n So it came from that tradition,\n\n20:33.060 --> 20:37.980\n but NumPy is a very pragmatic, practical tool.\n\n20:37.980 --> 20:39.260\n NumPy inherited from numeric\n\n20:39.260 --> 20:40.820\n and we can get to where NumPy came from\n\n20:40.820 --> 20:42.220\n which is the current array,\n\n20:43.340 --> 20:46.100\n at least current as of 2015, 2017.\n\n20:46.100 --> 20:49.320\n Now there's a ton of them over the past two or three years.\n\n20:49.320 --> 20:50.320\n We can get into that too.\n\n20:50.320 --> 20:52.780\n So if we just linger on the early days\n\n20:52.780 --> 20:56.220\n of what was your favorite feature of Python?\n\n20:56.220 --> 20:58.020\n Do you remember like what?\n\n20:58.020 --> 21:02.260\n So it's so interesting to linger on like the,\n\n21:02.260 --> 21:06.300\n what really makes you connect with a language?\n\n21:06.300 --> 21:09.400\n I'm not sure it's obvious to introspect that.\n\n21:09.400 --> 21:10.240\n No, it isn't.\n\n21:10.240 --> 21:12.860\n And I've thought about that at some length.\n\n21:12.860 --> 21:16.460\n I think definitely the fact that I could read it later,\n\n21:16.460 --> 21:18.140\n that I could use it productively\n\n21:18.140 --> 21:19.820\n without becoming an expert.\n\n21:19.820 --> 21:22.180\n Other language I had to put more effort into.\n\n21:22.180 --> 21:23.940\n That's like an empirical observation.\n\n21:23.940 --> 21:26.500\n Like you're not analyzing any one aspect of the language.\n\n21:26.500 --> 21:29.460\n It just seems time after time when you look back,\n\n21:29.460 --> 21:30.580\n it's somehow readable.\n\n21:30.580 --> 21:31.420\n It's somehow readable.\n\n21:31.420 --> 21:35.380\n Then it was sort of, I could take executable English\n\n21:35.380 --> 21:36.820\n and translate it to Python more easily.\n\n21:36.820 --> 21:39.760\n Like I didn't have to go, there was no translation layer.\n\n21:39.760 --> 21:41.580\n As an engineer or as a scientist,\n\n21:41.580 --> 21:43.240\n I could think about what I wanted to do.\n\n21:43.240 --> 21:46.780\n And then the syntax wasn't that far behind it, right?\n\n21:46.780 --> 21:49.220\n Now there are some warts there still.\n\n21:49.220 --> 21:50.600\n It wasn't perfect.\n\n21:50.600 --> 21:51.440\n Like there's some areas where I'm like,\n\n21:51.440 --> 21:52.820\n ah, it'd be better if this were different\n\n21:52.820 --> 21:54.380\n or if this were different.\n\n21:54.380 --> 21:56.580\n Some of those things got added to the language too.\n\n21:56.580 --> 21:58.580\n I was really grateful for some of the early pioneers\n\n21:58.580 --> 22:00.220\n in the Python ecosystem back,\n\n22:00.220 --> 22:01.900\n because Python got written in 91.\n\n22:01.900 --> 22:03.140\n That's when the first version came out.\n\n22:03.140 --> 22:06.540\n But Guido was very open to users.\n\n22:06.540 --> 22:08.660\n And one of the sets of users were people like Jim Huganen\n\n22:08.660 --> 22:13.460\n and David Asher and Paul Dubois and Conrad Hinson.\n\n22:13.460 --> 22:15.380\n These were people that were on the main list.\n\n22:15.380 --> 22:16.860\n And they were just asking for things like,\n\n22:16.860 --> 22:19.220\n hey, we really should have complex numbers in this language.\n\n22:19.220 --> 22:22.540\n So let's, you know, there's a J, there's a one J, right?\n\n22:22.540 --> 22:24.340\n And the fact that they went the engineering route of J\n\n22:24.340 --> 22:25.180\n is interesting.\n\n22:26.660 --> 22:28.620\n I don't think that's entirely favoring engineers.\n\n22:28.620 --> 22:30.460\n I think it's because I is so often used\n\n22:30.460 --> 22:32.100\n as the index of a for loop.\n\n22:32.100 --> 22:34.260\n So I think that's actually why.\n\n22:34.260 --> 22:36.740\n Probably, I mean, there's a pragmatic aspect.\n\n22:36.740 --> 22:39.100\n But the fact that complex numbers were there, I love that.\n\n22:39.100 --> 22:41.460\n The fact that I could write in the array constructs\n\n22:41.460 --> 22:42.820\n and that reduction was there,\n\n22:42.820 --> 22:46.540\n very simple to write summations and broadcasting was there.\n\n22:46.540 --> 22:48.420\n I could do addition of whole arrays.\n\n22:49.440 --> 22:50.380\n So that was cool.\n\n22:50.380 --> 22:52.660\n Those are some things I loved about it.\n\n22:52.660 --> 22:54.820\n I don't know what to start talking to you about\n\n22:54.820 --> 22:57.860\n because you've created so many incredible projects\n\n22:57.860 --> 23:00.180\n that basically changed the whole landscape of programming.\n\n23:00.180 --> 23:02.380\n But okay, let's start with,\n\n23:02.380 --> 23:06.060\n let's go chronologically with SciPy.\n\n23:06.060 --> 23:09.100\n You created SciPy over two decades ago now?\n\n23:09.100 --> 23:11.140\n Yes, yes, I love to talk about SciPy.\n\n23:11.140 --> 23:12.980\n SciPy was really my baby.\n\n23:12.980 --> 23:14.420\n What is it?\n\n23:14.420 --> 23:15.420\n What was its goal?\n\n23:15.420 --> 23:16.420\n What is its goal?\n\n23:16.420 --> 23:17.260\n How does it work?\n\n23:17.260 --> 23:18.100\n Yeah, fantastic.\n\n23:18.100 --> 23:21.580\n So SciPy was effectively, here I am using Python\n\n23:21.580 --> 23:24.980\n to do stuff that I previously used MATLAB to use.\n\n23:24.980 --> 23:26.860\n And I was using numeric, which is an array library\n\n23:26.860 --> 23:28.300\n that made a lot of it possible.\n\n23:28.300 --> 23:29.900\n But there's things that were missing.\n\n23:29.900 --> 23:32.100\n Like I didn't have an ordinary differential equation solver\n\n23:32.100 --> 23:33.460\n I could just call, right?\n\n23:33.460 --> 23:35.260\n I didn't have integration.\n\n23:35.260 --> 23:37.180\n Hey, I wanted to integrate this function.\n\n23:37.180 --> 23:38.780\n Okay, well, I don't have just a function\n\n23:38.780 --> 23:40.580\n I can call to do that.\n\n23:40.580 --> 23:42.540\n These are things I remember being critical things\n\n23:42.540 --> 23:43.700\n that I was missing.\n\n23:43.700 --> 23:44.580\n Optimization.\n\n23:44.580 --> 23:46.780\n I just wanna pass a function to an optimizer\n\n23:46.780 --> 23:49.100\n and have it tell me what the optimal value is.\n\n23:50.100 --> 23:51.100\n Those are things I'm like, well,\n\n23:51.100 --> 23:54.340\n why don't we just write a library that adds these tools?\n\n23:54.340 --> 23:55.740\n And I started to post on the mailing list\n\n23:55.740 --> 23:58.100\n and there'd previously been, people have discussed,\n\n23:58.100 --> 23:59.140\n I remember Conrad Henson saying,\n\n23:59.140 --> 24:00.980\n wouldn't it be great if we had this optimizer library\n\n24:00.980 --> 24:02.580\n or David Ashwood say this stuff.\n\n24:02.580 --> 24:06.940\n And I'm a ambitious, ambitious is the wrong word,\n\n24:06.940 --> 24:11.340\n an eager and probably more time than sense.\n\n24:11.340 --> 24:13.620\n I was a poor graduate student.\n\n24:13.620 --> 24:15.860\n My wife thinks I'm working on my PhD and I am,\n\n24:15.860 --> 24:17.220\n but part of the PhD that I loved\n\n24:17.220 --> 24:19.180\n was the fact that it's exploratory.\n\n24:19.180 --> 24:21.540\n You're not just taking orders,\n\n24:21.540 --> 24:23.500\n fulfilling a list of things to do,\n\n24:23.500 --> 24:25.740\n you're trying to figure out what to do.\n\n24:25.740 --> 24:27.900\n And so I thought, well, I'm running tools\n\n24:27.900 --> 24:29.140\n for my own use and a PhD,\n\n24:29.140 --> 24:32.140\n so I'll just start this project.\n\n24:32.140 --> 24:34.940\n And so in 99, 98 was when I first started\n\n24:34.940 --> 24:36.620\n to write libraries for Python.\n\n24:36.620 --> 24:38.260\n Definitely when I fell in love with Python 98,\n\n24:38.260 --> 24:39.740\n I thought, oh, well, there's just a few things missing.\n\n24:39.740 --> 24:42.700\n Like, oh, I need a reader to read DICOM files.\n\n24:42.700 --> 24:44.580\n I was in medical imaging and DICOM was a format\n\n24:44.580 --> 24:46.940\n that I want to be able to load that into Python.\n\n24:46.940 --> 24:48.180\n Okay, how do I write a reader for that?\n\n24:48.180 --> 24:51.700\n So I wrote something called, it was an IO package, right?\n\n24:51.700 --> 24:55.140\n And that was my very first extension module, which is C.\n\n24:55.140 --> 24:57.060\n So I wrote C code to extend Python\n\n24:57.060 --> 24:59.660\n so that in Python I could write things more easily.\n\n24:59.660 --> 25:02.260\n That combination kind of hooked me.\n\n25:02.260 --> 25:03.300\n It was the idea that I could,\n\n25:03.300 --> 25:05.700\n here's this powerful tool I can use as a scripting language\n\n25:05.700 --> 25:07.460\n and a high level language to think about,\n\n25:07.460 --> 25:11.420\n but that I can extend easily, easily in C,\n\n25:11.420 --> 25:13.780\n easily for me because I knew enough C.\n\n25:13.780 --> 25:15.260\n And then Guido had written a link.\n\n25:15.260 --> 25:17.220\n I mean, the only, the hard part of extending Python\n\n25:17.220 --> 25:19.500\n was something called the way memory management networks,\n\n25:19.500 --> 25:21.060\n and you have to do reference counting.\n\n25:21.060 --> 25:23.820\n And so there's a tracking of reference counting\n\n25:23.820 --> 25:25.500\n you have to do manually.\n\n25:25.500 --> 25:27.500\n And if you don't, you have memory leaks.\n\n25:27.500 --> 25:29.020\n And so that's hard.\n\n25:29.020 --> 25:31.020\n Plus then C, you know, it's just much more,\n\n25:31.020 --> 25:32.180\n you have to put more effort into it.\n\n25:32.180 --> 25:34.700\n It's not just, I have to now think about pointers\n\n25:34.700 --> 25:37.620\n and I have to think about stuff that is different.\n\n25:37.620 --> 25:38.460\n I have to kind of,\n\n25:38.460 --> 25:40.620\n you're like putting a new cartridge in your brain.\n\n25:40.620 --> 25:42.380\n Like, okay, I'm thinking about MRI.\n\n25:42.380 --> 25:43.580\n Now I'm thinking about programming.\n\n25:43.580 --> 25:45.340\n And there are distinct modules\n\n25:45.340 --> 25:46.620\n you end up having to think about.\n\n25:46.620 --> 25:47.460\n So it's harder.\n\n25:47.460 --> 25:48.300\n And when I was just in Python,\n\n25:48.300 --> 25:51.500\n I could just think about MRI and high level writing,\n\n25:51.500 --> 25:52.340\n but I could do that.\n\n25:52.340 --> 25:54.020\n And that kind of, I liked it.\n\n25:54.020 --> 25:55.780\n I found that to be enjoyable and fun.\n\n25:55.780 --> 25:57.220\n And so I ended up, oh,\n\n25:57.220 --> 25:59.020\n well, let me just add a bunch of stuff to Python\n\n25:59.020 --> 26:00.580\n to do integration.\n\n26:00.580 --> 26:01.660\n Well, and the cool thing is,\n\n26:01.660 --> 26:03.060\n is that the power of the internet,\n\n26:03.060 --> 26:04.300\n just looking around and I found,\n\n26:04.300 --> 26:06.300\n oh, there's this NetLive,\n\n26:06.300 --> 26:08.860\n which has hundreds of 4chan routines\n\n26:08.860 --> 26:12.260\n that people have written in the 60s and the 70s and the 80s\n\n26:12.260 --> 26:14.900\n in 4chan 77, fortunately, it wasn't 4chan 16.\n\n26:14.900 --> 26:17.220\n So it had been ported to 4chan 77.\n\n26:18.100 --> 26:21.660\n And 4chan 77 is actually a really great language.\n\n26:21.660 --> 26:24.100\n 4chan 90 probably is my favorite 4chan\n\n26:24.100 --> 26:26.100\n because it's also, it's got complex numbers,\n\n26:26.100 --> 26:27.700\n got arrays and it's pretty high level.\n\n26:27.700 --> 26:28.980\n Now, the problem with it\n\n26:28.980 --> 26:31.020\n is you'd never want to write a program in 4chan 90\n\n26:31.020 --> 26:32.260\n or 4chan 77,\n\n26:32.260 --> 26:34.900\n but it's totally fine to write a subroutine in, right?\n\n26:34.900 --> 26:37.660\n And so, and then 4chan kind of got a little off course\n\n26:37.660 --> 26:39.060\n when they tried to compete with C++.\n\n26:39.060 --> 26:40.580\n But at the time,\n\n26:40.580 --> 26:42.340\n I just want libraries to do something like,\n\n26:42.340 --> 26:43.940\n oh, here's an ordinary differential equation.\n\n26:43.940 --> 26:44.900\n Here's integration.\n\n26:44.900 --> 26:46.780\n Here's runge cut integration.\n\n26:46.780 --> 26:47.620\n Already done.\n\n26:47.620 --> 26:48.780\n I don't have to think about that algorithm.\n\n26:48.780 --> 26:49.620\n I mean, you could,\n\n26:49.620 --> 26:51.020\n but it's nice to have somebody who's already done one\n\n26:51.020 --> 26:51.860\n and tested it.\n\n26:51.860 --> 26:55.060\n And so I sort of started this journey in 98, really.\n\n26:55.060 --> 26:55.980\n If you look back at the mailing list,\n\n26:55.980 --> 26:58.580\n there's sort of this productive era of me\n\n26:59.660 --> 27:01.100\n writing an extension module\n\n27:01.100 --> 27:04.580\n to connect runge cut integration to Python\n\n27:04.580 --> 27:06.660\n and making an ordinary differential equation solver.\n\n27:06.660 --> 27:09.140\n And then releasing that as a package.\n\n27:09.140 --> 27:11.820\n So we could call ODE pack, I think I called it then.\n\n27:11.820 --> 27:12.660\n Quad pack.\n\n27:12.660 --> 27:14.420\n And then I just made these packages.\n\n27:14.420 --> 27:16.260\n Eventually that became multipack\n\n27:16.260 --> 27:17.580\n because they're originally modular.\n\n27:17.580 --> 27:19.140\n You can install them separately.\n\n27:19.140 --> 27:20.700\n But a massive problem in Python\n\n27:20.700 --> 27:23.420\n was actually just getting your stuff installed.\n\n27:23.420 --> 27:25.820\n At the time, releasing software for me,\n\n27:25.820 --> 27:27.580\n like today it's people think, what does that mean?\n\n27:27.580 --> 27:30.780\n Well, then it meant some poorly written webpage.\n\n27:30.780 --> 27:33.100\n I had some bad webpage up and I put a tarball,\n\n27:33.100 --> 27:35.780\n just a GZIP tarball of source code.\n\n27:35.780 --> 27:37.140\n That was the release.\n\n27:37.140 --> 27:39.180\n But okay, can we just stand that?\n\n27:39.180 --> 27:43.060\n Because the community aspect\n\n27:43.060 --> 27:47.820\n of creating the package and sharing that, that's rare.\n\n27:47.820 --> 27:50.940\n That, to have, to both have the, at that time,\n\n27:50.940 --> 27:51.780\n so like the raw.\n\n27:51.780 --> 27:52.740\n Yeah, it was pretty early, yeah.\n\n27:52.740 --> 27:54.660\n Oh, well, not rare.\n\n27:54.660 --> 27:57.020\n Maybe you can correct me on this,\n\n27:57.020 --> 27:59.660\n but it seems like in the scientific community,\n\n27:59.660 --> 28:02.420\n so many people, you were basically solving the problems\n\n28:02.420 --> 28:07.100\n you needed to solve to process the particular application,\n\n28:07.100 --> 28:08.540\n the data that you need.\n\n28:08.540 --> 28:10.900\n And to also have the mind\n\n28:10.900 --> 28:15.340\n that I'm going to make this usable for others, that's.\n\n28:15.340 --> 28:16.500\n I would say I was inspired.\n\n28:16.500 --> 28:18.060\n I'd been inspired by Linux,\n\n28:18.060 --> 28:21.820\n been inspired by Linus and him making his code available.\n\n28:21.820 --> 28:23.260\n And I was starting to use Linux at the time.\n\n28:23.260 --> 28:24.460\n And I went, this is cool.\n\n28:24.460 --> 28:27.060\n So I'd kind of been previously primed that way.\n\n28:27.060 --> 28:29.180\n And generally I was into science\n\n28:29.180 --> 28:30.980\n because I liked the sharing notion.\n\n28:30.980 --> 28:32.660\n I liked the idea of, hey, let's,\n\n28:32.660 --> 28:34.780\n if collectively we build knowledge and share it,\n\n28:34.780 --> 28:35.740\n we can all be better off.\n\n28:35.740 --> 28:37.420\n Okay, so you want to energize by that idea.\n\n28:37.420 --> 28:39.540\n So I was energized by that idea already, right?\n\n28:39.540 --> 28:40.940\n And I can't deny that I was.\n\n28:40.940 --> 28:42.900\n I'm sort of had this very,\n\n28:42.900 --> 28:45.700\n I liked that part of science, that part of sharing.\n\n28:45.700 --> 28:47.300\n And then all of a sudden, oh, wait, here's something.\n\n28:47.300 --> 28:49.940\n And here's something I could do.\n\n28:49.940 --> 28:52.780\n And then I slowly over years learned how to share better\n\n28:52.780 --> 28:55.100\n so that you could actually engage more people faster.\n\n28:55.100 --> 28:57.100\n One of the key things was actually giving people a binary\n\n28:57.100 --> 28:58.980\n they could install, right?\n\n28:58.980 --> 29:01.460\n So that it wasn't just your source code, good luck.\n\n29:01.460 --> 29:02.660\n Compile this and then.\n\n29:02.660 --> 29:05.180\n It's compiled, ready to install, just, you know.\n\n29:05.180 --> 29:07.380\n So in fact, a lot of the journey from 98,\n\n29:07.380 --> 29:10.780\n even through 2012 when I started Anaconda was about that.\n\n29:10.780 --> 29:13.260\n Like it's why, you know, it's really the key\n\n29:13.260 --> 29:17.460\n as to why a scientist with dreams of doing MRI research\n\n29:17.460 --> 29:19.500\n ended up starting a software company\n\n29:19.500 --> 29:22.260\n that installs software.\n\n29:22.260 --> 29:25.700\n I work with a few folks now that don't program\n\n29:26.700 --> 29:28.580\n like on the creative side and the video side,\n\n29:28.580 --> 29:29.620\n the audio side.\n\n29:29.620 --> 29:32.500\n And because my whole life is running on scripts,\n\n29:32.500 --> 29:34.020\n I have to try to get them,\n\n29:34.020 --> 29:35.900\n I'm having all the task of teaching them\n\n29:35.900 --> 29:39.220\n how to do Python enough to run the scripts.\n\n29:39.220 --> 29:40.820\n And so I've been actually facing this,\n\n29:40.820 --> 29:44.220\n whether it's Anaconda or some with the task of\n\n29:44.220 --> 29:46.780\n how do I minimally explain basically to my mom\n\n29:46.780 --> 29:48.900\n how to write a Python script.\n\n29:48.900 --> 29:50.500\n And it's an interesting challenge.\n\n29:50.500 --> 29:53.020\n I have to, it's a to do item for me to figure out like,\n\n29:53.020 --> 29:56.340\n what is the minimal amount of information I have to teach?\n\n29:56.340 --> 29:59.700\n What are the tools you use that one, you enjoy it,\n\n29:59.700 --> 30:00.540\n two, you're effective at it.\n\n30:00.540 --> 30:02.540\n And they're related, those are two related questions.\n\n30:02.540 --> 30:05.500\n And then the debugging, like the iterative process\n\n30:05.500 --> 30:07.820\n of running the script to figure out what the error is,\n\n30:07.820 --> 30:11.580\n maybe even for some people to do the fix yourself.\n\n30:11.580 --> 30:12.660\n So do you compile it?\n\n30:12.660 --> 30:15.620\n Do you, like how do you distribute that code to them?\n\n30:15.620 --> 30:18.540\n And it's interesting because I think\n\n30:18.540 --> 30:20.100\n it's exactly what you're talking about.\n\n30:20.100 --> 30:24.260\n If you increase the circle of empathy,\n\n30:24.260 --> 30:28.060\n the circle of people that are able to use your programs,\n\n30:28.900 --> 30:32.900\n you increase it, it's like effectiveness and it's power.\n\n30:32.900 --> 30:37.020\n And so you have to think, can I write scripts?\n\n30:37.020 --> 30:40.140\n Can I write programs that can be used by medical engineers,\n\n30:40.140 --> 30:43.900\n by all kinds of people that don't know programming\n\n30:43.900 --> 30:45.980\n and actually maybe plant a seed,\n\n30:46.900 --> 30:48.380\n have them catch the bug of programming\n\n30:48.380 --> 30:50.180\n so that they start on a journey.\n\n30:50.180 --> 30:51.500\n That's a huge responsibility.\n\n30:51.500 --> 30:55.340\n And ultimately it has to do with the Amazon one click buy.\n\n30:55.340 --> 30:58.780\n Like how frictionless can you make the early steps?\n\n30:58.780 --> 31:00.380\n Frictionless is actually really key.\n\n31:00.380 --> 31:03.020\n To go in any community is, any friction point,\n\n31:03.020 --> 31:05.180\n you're just gonna lose some people, right?\n\n31:05.180 --> 31:09.060\n Now sometimes you may wanna intentionally do that.\n\n31:09.060 --> 31:11.620\n If you're early enough on, you need a lot of help.\n\n31:11.620 --> 31:13.340\n You need people who have the skills.\n\n31:13.340 --> 31:14.740\n You might actually, it's helpful.\n\n31:14.740 --> 31:16.820\n You don't necessarily have too many users\n\n31:16.820 --> 31:20.340\n as opposed to contributors if you're early on.\n\n31:20.340 --> 31:23.100\n Anyway, there's, SciFi started in 98,\n\n31:23.100 --> 31:25.740\n but it really emerged as this collection of modules\n\n31:25.740 --> 31:27.340\n that I was just putting on the net.\n\n31:27.340 --> 31:31.580\n People were downloading and I think I got 100 users, right?\n\n31:31.580 --> 31:32.660\n By the end of that year.\n\n31:32.660 --> 31:35.660\n But the fact that I got 100 users and more than that,\n\n31:35.660 --> 31:39.420\n people started to email me with fixes.\n\n31:39.420 --> 31:41.300\n And that was actually intoxicating, right?\n\n31:41.300 --> 31:44.220\n That was the, here I'm writing papers\n\n31:44.220 --> 31:46.180\n and I'm giving conferences and I get people to say hello,\n\n31:46.180 --> 31:47.420\n but yeah, good job.\n\n31:47.420 --> 31:49.860\n But mostly it was, you're viewed with,\n\n31:49.860 --> 31:51.540\n it's competitive, right?\n\n31:51.540 --> 31:52.900\n You publish a paper and people are like,\n\n31:52.900 --> 31:54.180\n oh, it wasn't my paper.\n\n31:55.900 --> 31:59.220\n I was starting to see that sense of academic life\n\n31:59.220 --> 32:00.180\n where it was so much,\n\n32:00.180 --> 32:01.460\n I thought there was this cooperative effort,\n\n32:01.460 --> 32:04.940\n but it sounds like we're here just to one up each other.\n\n32:04.940 --> 32:07.700\n And it's not true across the board,\n\n32:07.700 --> 32:08.580\n but a lot of that's there.\n\n32:08.580 --> 32:09.660\n But here in this world,\n\n32:09.660 --> 32:12.660\n I was getting responses from people all over the world.\n\n32:13.700 --> 32:16.060\n I remember Pjaro Peterson in Estonia, right?\n\n32:16.060 --> 32:17.340\n Was one of the first people.\n\n32:17.340 --> 32:18.740\n And he sent me back this make file,\n\n32:18.740 --> 32:21.220\n cause the first thing it is, yeah, your build thing stinks\n\n32:21.220 --> 32:23.020\n and here's a better make file.\n\n32:23.020 --> 32:24.380\n Now it was a complex make file.\n\n32:24.380 --> 32:26.580\n I don't think I never understood that make file actually,\n\n32:26.580 --> 32:29.220\n but it worked and it did a lot more.\n\n32:29.220 --> 32:30.980\n And so I said, thanks, this is cool.\n\n32:30.980 --> 32:32.500\n And that was my first kind of engagement\n\n32:32.500 --> 32:35.100\n with community development.\n\n32:35.100 --> 32:37.660\n But the process was, he sent me a patch file.\n\n32:37.660 --> 32:39.900\n I had to upload a new tar ball.\n\n32:39.900 --> 32:41.580\n And I just found, I really love that.\n\n32:41.580 --> 32:43.660\n And the style back then was here's a mailing list.\n\n32:43.660 --> 32:45.740\n It's very, it wasn't as,\n\n32:45.740 --> 32:47.660\n it's certainly weren't the tools that are available today.\n\n32:47.660 --> 32:49.940\n It was very early on, but I really started to,\n\n32:49.940 --> 32:50.780\n that's the whole year.\n\n32:50.780 --> 32:54.580\n I think I did about seven packages that year, right?\n\n32:54.580 --> 32:55.540\n And then by the end of the year,\n\n32:55.540 --> 32:57.840\n I collected them into a thing called multipack.\n\n32:57.840 --> 32:59.780\n So in 99, there was this thing called multipack.\n\n32:59.780 --> 33:01.820\n And that's when a high school student,\n\n33:01.820 --> 33:03.060\n no, he was a high school student at the time,\n\n33:03.060 --> 33:04.780\n guy named Robert Kern,\n\n33:04.780 --> 33:09.700\n took that package and made a Windows installer, right?\n\n33:09.700 --> 33:12.700\n And then of course, a massive increase of usage.\n\n33:12.700 --> 33:15.860\n So by the way, most of this development was under Linux.\n\n33:15.860 --> 33:17.380\n Yes, yes, it was on Linux.\n\n33:17.380 --> 33:20.240\n I was a Linux developer doing it on a Unix box.\n\n33:20.240 --> 33:23.020\n I mean, at the time I was actually getting into,\n\n33:23.020 --> 33:24.060\n I had a new hard drive,\n\n33:24.060 --> 33:26.500\n did some kernel programming to make the hard drive work.\n\n33:26.500 --> 33:28.780\n I mean, not programming, but modification to the kernel\n\n33:28.780 --> 33:31.180\n so I could actually get a hard drive working.\n\n33:31.180 --> 33:32.320\n I love that aspect of it.\n\n33:32.320 --> 33:36.100\n I was also in, at school, I was building a cluster.\n\n33:36.100 --> 33:39.940\n I took Mac computers and you put yellow dog Linux on them.\n\n33:40.940 --> 33:42.140\n At the Mayo Clinic, they were just,\n\n33:42.140 --> 33:43.520\n they had all these Macs that were older,\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:44.740\n they were just getting rid of.\n\n33:44.740 --> 33:46.820\n And so I kind of got permission to go grab them together.\n\n33:46.820 --> 33:50.340\n I put about 24 of them together in a cluster, in a cabinet,\n\n33:50.340 --> 33:51.700\n and put yellow dog Linux on them all.\n\n33:51.700 --> 33:56.240\n And I wrote a C++ program to do MRI simulation.\n\n33:56.240 --> 33:58.900\n That was what I was doing at the same time\n\n33:58.900 --> 34:01.400\n for my day job, so to speak.\n\n34:01.400 --> 34:03.460\n So I was loving the whole process.\n\n34:03.460 --> 34:04.300\n And the same time I was,\n\n34:04.300 --> 34:06.260\n oh, I need a ordinary differential equation.\n\n34:06.260 --> 34:08.160\n That's why ordinary differential equations were key\n\n34:08.160 --> 34:09.820\n was because that's the heart of a block equation\n\n34:09.820 --> 34:12.420\n for simulating MRI, is an ODE solver.\n\n34:12.420 --> 34:15.720\n And so that's, but I actually did that,\n\n34:15.720 --> 34:16.980\n it just happened at the same time.\n\n34:16.980 --> 34:18.540\n That's why it was kind of what you're working on\n\n34:18.540 --> 34:20.500\n and what you're interested in, they're coinciding.\n\n34:20.500 --> 34:22.380\n I was definitely scratching my own itch\n\n34:22.380 --> 34:24.060\n in terms of building stuff.\n\n34:24.060 --> 34:27.040\n And which helped in the sense that I was using it for me,\n\n34:27.040 --> 34:28.540\n so at least I had one user.\n\n34:28.540 --> 34:30.360\n I had one person who was like, well, no, this is better.\n\n34:30.360 --> 34:31.420\n I like this interface better.\n\n34:31.420 --> 34:33.300\n And I had the experience of MATLAB\n\n34:33.300 --> 34:36.480\n to guide some of what those APIs might look like.\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:37.720\n But you're just doing yourself,\n\n34:37.720 --> 34:39.000\n you're building all this stuff.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:40.060\n But with the Windows installer,\n\n34:40.060 --> 34:41.460\n it was the first time I realized, oh yeah,\n\n34:41.460 --> 34:43.740\n the binary installer really helps people.\n\n34:43.740 --> 34:46.980\n And so that led to spending more time\n\n34:46.980 --> 34:49.100\n on that side of things.\n\n34:49.100 --> 34:52.780\n So around 2000, so I graduated my PhD in 2000,\n\n34:52.780 --> 34:53.780\n end of year, end of 2000.\n\n34:53.780 --> 34:56.660\n So 99 doing a lot of work there,\n\n34:56.660 --> 34:57.740\n 98 doing a lot of work there,\n\n34:57.740 --> 35:00.780\n 99 kind of spending more time on my PhD,\n\n35:00.780 --> 35:02.420\n helping people use the tools,\n\n35:02.420 --> 35:04.060\n thinking about what do I want to go from here.\n\n35:04.060 --> 35:05.620\n There was a company, there was a guy actually,\n\n35:05.620 --> 35:07.620\n Eric Jones and Travis Vought.\n\n35:07.620 --> 35:11.080\n They were two friends who founded a company called NTHOT.\n\n35:11.080 --> 35:13.620\n It's here in Austin, still here.\n\n35:13.620 --> 35:16.060\n And they, Eric contacted me at the time\n\n35:16.060 --> 35:19.380\n when I was a graduate student still.\n\n35:19.380 --> 35:20.860\n And he said, hey, why don't you come down?\n\n35:20.860 --> 35:22.660\n We want to build a company.\n\n35:22.660 --> 35:25.720\n We're thinking of a scientific company\n\n35:25.720 --> 35:27.560\n and we want to take what you're doing\n\n35:27.560 --> 35:29.460\n and kind of add it to some stuff that he'd done.\n\n35:29.460 --> 35:31.220\n He'd written some tools.\n\n35:31.220 --> 35:32.820\n And then Piero Peterson had done F2Py.\n\n35:32.820 --> 35:34.380\n Let's come together and build,\n\n35:34.380 --> 35:36.740\n pull this all together and call it SciPy.\n\n35:36.740 --> 35:39.480\n So that's the origin of the SciPy brand.\n\n35:39.480 --> 35:41.380\n It came from multi pack\n\n35:41.380 --> 35:42.580\n and a whole bunch of modules I'd written,\n\n35:42.580 --> 35:44.500\n plus a few things from some other folks\n\n35:44.500 --> 35:47.580\n and then pulled together in a single installer.\n\n35:47.580 --> 35:49.540\n SciPy was really a distribution of Python\n\n35:49.540 --> 35:51.260\n masquerading as a library.\n\n35:51.260 --> 35:54.340\n How did you think about SciPy in context of Python,\n\n35:54.340 --> 35:56.180\n in context of Numeric, like what?\n\n35:56.180 --> 35:59.020\n So we saw SciPy as a way to make an R&D environment\n\n35:59.020 --> 36:03.380\n for Python, like use Python, depended on Numeric.\n\n36:03.380 --> 36:05.540\n So Numeric was the array library we depended on.\n\n36:05.540 --> 36:08.260\n And then from there, extend it with a bunch of modules\n\n36:08.260 --> 36:10.340\n that allowed for, and at the time,\n\n36:10.340 --> 36:13.180\n the original vision of SciPy was to have plotting,\n\n36:13.180 --> 36:16.140\n was to have the REPL environment\n\n36:16.140 --> 36:18.500\n and kind of really a whole data environment\n\n36:19.500 --> 36:21.020\n that you could then install and get going with.\n\n36:21.020 --> 36:23.020\n And that was kind of the thinking.\n\n36:23.020 --> 36:25.020\n It didn't really evolve that way, right?\n\n36:25.020 --> 36:27.580\n It sort of had a, for one,\n\n36:27.580 --> 36:30.540\n it's really hard to do massive scale projects\n\n36:31.940 --> 36:33.380\n with open source collectives.\n\n36:34.300 --> 36:38.500\n Actually, there's sort of an intrinsic cooperation limit\n\n36:38.500 --> 36:40.780\n as to which, too many cooks in the kitchen,\n\n36:40.780 --> 36:42.780\n you can do amazing infrastructure work.\n\n36:42.780 --> 36:44.220\n When it comes down to bringing it all together\n\n36:44.220 --> 36:45.860\n into a single deliverable,\n\n36:45.860 --> 36:49.660\n that actually requires a little more product management\n\n36:49.660 --> 36:52.820\n that is not, that doesn't really emerge\n\n36:52.820 --> 36:53.980\n from the same dynamic.\n\n36:53.980 --> 36:57.860\n So it struggled, struggled to get almost too many voices.\n\n36:57.860 --> 36:59.220\n It's hard to have everybody agree.\n\n36:59.220 --> 37:02.100\n Consensus doesn't really work at that scale.\n\n37:02.100 --> 37:03.260\n You end up with politics,\n\n37:03.260 --> 37:05.220\n with the same kind of things that's happened\n\n37:05.220 --> 37:07.100\n in large organizations trying to decide\n\n37:07.100 --> 37:09.380\n what to do together.\n\n37:09.380 --> 37:12.340\n So consensus building was challenging at scale\n\n37:12.340 --> 37:13.860\n as more people came in, right?\n\n37:13.860 --> 37:15.700\n Early on, it's fine, because there's nobody there.\n\n37:15.700 --> 37:17.740\n So it works, but then as you get more successful\n\n37:17.740 --> 37:18.980\n and more people use it, all of a sudden,\n\n37:18.980 --> 37:22.300\n oh, there's this scale at which this doesn't work anymore\n\n37:22.300 --> 37:23.980\n and we have to come up with different approaches.\n\n37:23.980 --> 37:26.700\n So Sidepy came out officially in 2001,\n\n37:26.700 --> 37:28.900\n was the first release, most of the time.\n\n37:28.900 --> 37:31.060\n I remember the days of getting that release ready.\n\n37:31.060 --> 37:33.420\n It was a Windows installer and there were bugs\n\n37:33.420 --> 37:36.300\n on how the Windows compiler handled complex numbers\n\n37:36.300 --> 37:38.540\n and you were chasing segmentation faults.\n\n37:38.540 --> 37:40.420\n And it was, it's a lot of work.\n\n37:40.420 --> 37:43.140\n There was a lot of effort had nothing to do\n\n37:43.140 --> 37:45.540\n with my area of study.\n\n37:45.540 --> 37:47.500\n And at the same time, I had just gotten an offer.\n\n37:47.500 --> 37:48.780\n So he wondered if I wanted to come down\n\n37:48.780 --> 37:51.460\n and help him start that company with his friend.\n\n37:51.460 --> 37:53.380\n And at the time I was like, I was intrigued,\n\n37:53.380 --> 37:56.620\n but I was squaring a path, an academic path.\n\n37:56.620 --> 37:59.980\n And I had just got an offer to go and teach at my alma mater.\n\n37:59.980 --> 38:02.420\n So I took that tenure track position.\n\n38:02.420 --> 38:05.180\n And Sidepy, and kind of, then I started to work on Sidepy\n\n38:05.180 --> 38:07.060\n as a professor too.\n\n38:07.060 --> 38:09.540\n So that's, I left, I've got the Mayo Clinic,\n\n38:09.540 --> 38:11.700\n graduated, wrote my thesis using Sidepy,\n\n38:11.700 --> 38:15.500\n wrote, you know, there's images that were created.\n\n38:15.500 --> 38:17.300\n Now the plotting tool I used was something\n\n38:17.300 --> 38:18.660\n from Yorick actually.\n\n38:18.660 --> 38:21.940\n It was a plotting, a PLT kind of a plotting language\n\n38:21.940 --> 38:22.780\n that I used.\n\n38:22.780 --> 38:23.940\n Yorick is a programming language?\n\n38:23.940 --> 38:26.340\n It was a programming language, had a plotting tool,\n\n38:26.340 --> 38:28.940\n Dyslin, it had integration to Dyslin.\n\n38:28.940 --> 38:31.340\n I ended up using Dyslin plus some of the plotting\n\n38:31.340 --> 38:33.740\n from Yorick linked to from Python.\n\n38:33.740 --> 38:37.180\n Anyway, it was, people don't plot that way now,\n\n38:37.180 --> 38:40.260\n but this is before, and Sidepy was trying to add plotting.\n\n38:40.260 --> 38:41.460\n Yeah. Right?\n\n38:41.460 --> 38:42.580\n It didn't have much success.\n\n38:42.580 --> 38:45.580\n Really the success of plotting came from John Hunter,\n\n38:45.580 --> 38:47.420\n who had a similar experience to my experience,\n\n38:47.420 --> 38:49.660\n my kind of maverick experience as a person\n\n38:49.660 --> 38:51.700\n just trying to get stuff done and kind of having more time\n\n38:51.700 --> 38:53.820\n than money maybe, right?\n\n38:53.820 --> 38:55.300\n And John Hunter created what?\n\n38:55.300 --> 38:56.300\n MapPlotLib.\n\n38:56.300 --> 38:57.140\n He's the creator of MapPlotLib.\n\n38:57.140 --> 38:59.140\n Yeah, so John Hunter was, you know,\n\n38:59.140 --> 39:00.580\n he wasn't a student at the time, but he was an,\n\n39:00.580 --> 39:02.120\n he was working in Quant field and he said,\n\n39:02.120 --> 39:03.500\n we need better plotting.\n\n39:03.500 --> 39:05.540\n So he just went out and said, cool, I'll make a new project\n\n39:05.540 --> 39:06.580\n and we'll call it MapPlotLib.\n\n39:06.580 --> 39:08.260\n And he released in 2001,\n\n39:08.260 --> 39:09.920\n about the same time that Sidepy came out\n\n39:09.920 --> 39:12.960\n and it was separate library, separate install,\n\n39:12.960 --> 39:15.540\n use numeric, Sidepy use numeric.\n\n39:15.540 --> 39:18.980\n And so Sidepy, you know, in 2001, we released Sidepy\n\n39:18.980 --> 39:22.380\n and then Endthought created a conference called Sidepy,\n\n39:22.380 --> 39:25.460\n which was brought people together to talk about the space.\n\n39:25.460 --> 39:26.700\n And that conference is still ongoing.\n\n39:26.700 --> 39:28.460\n It's one of the favorite conferences of a lot of people\n\n39:28.460 --> 39:30.820\n because it's, you know, it's changed over the years,\n\n39:30.820 --> 39:33.740\n but early on it was, you know, a collection of 50 people\n\n39:33.740 --> 39:36.700\n who care about, scientists mostly, you know,\n\n39:36.700 --> 39:39.300\n practicing scientists who want, who care about coding\n\n39:39.300 --> 39:42.140\n and doing it well and not using MATLAB.\n\n39:42.140 --> 39:44.120\n And I remember being driven by, you know, I liked MATLAB,\n\n39:44.120 --> 39:46.420\n but I didn't like the fact that,\n\n39:46.420 --> 39:48.060\n so I'm not opposed to proprietary software.\n\n39:48.060 --> 39:50.220\n I'm actually not an open source zealot.\n\n39:50.220 --> 39:52.660\n I love open source for the, what it brings,\n\n39:52.660 --> 39:54.460\n but I also see the role for proprietary software.\n\n39:54.460 --> 39:56.580\n But what I didn't like was the fact that I would develop\n\n39:56.580 --> 39:59.940\n code and publish it and then effectively telling somebody\n\n39:59.940 --> 40:01.420\n here to run my code, you have to have\n\n40:01.420 --> 40:02.500\n this proprietary software.\n\n40:02.500 --> 40:05.940\n Right, and there's also culture around MATLAB as much,\n\n40:05.940 --> 40:08.260\n because I've talked to a few folks in,\n\n40:08.260 --> 40:09.820\n MathWorks creates MATLAB?\n\n40:09.820 --> 40:10.820\n Yeah.\n\n40:10.820 --> 40:13.900\n I mean, there's just a culture, they try really hard,\n\n40:13.900 --> 40:16.820\n but it just, there's this corporate IBM style culture\n\n40:16.820 --> 40:18.380\n that's like, or whatever.\n\n40:18.380 --> 40:20.780\n I don't want to say negative things about IBM or whatever,\n\n40:20.780 --> 40:22.260\n but there's a...\n\n40:22.260 --> 40:23.740\n No, it's really that connection.\n\n40:23.740 --> 40:24.940\n It's something I'm in the middle of right now\n\n40:24.940 --> 40:27.000\n is the business of open source.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:30.820\n And how do you connect the ethos of cooperative development\n\n40:30.820 --> 40:34.780\n with the necessity of creating profits, right?\n\n40:34.780 --> 40:38.060\n And like right now today, I'm still in the middle of that.\n\n40:38.060 --> 40:42.260\n That's actually the early days of me exploring this question.\n\n40:42.260 --> 40:44.660\n Cause I was writing SciPy, I mean, as an aside,\n\n40:44.660 --> 40:46.540\n I also had, so I had three kids at the time.\n\n40:46.540 --> 40:47.860\n I have six kids now.\n\n40:47.860 --> 40:49.980\n I got married early, wanted a family.\n\n40:50.860 --> 40:52.620\n I had three kids and I remember reading,\n\n40:52.620 --> 40:55.540\n I read Richard Stallman's post and I was a fan of Stallman.\n\n40:55.540 --> 40:58.100\n I would read his work, I liked this collective ideas\n\n40:58.100 --> 40:58.940\n he would have.\n\n40:58.940 --> 41:01.740\n Certainly the ideas on IP law, I read a lot of his stuff.\n\n41:01.740 --> 41:04.820\n But then he said, okay, well,\n\n41:04.820 --> 41:05.780\n how do I make money with this?\n\n41:05.780 --> 41:06.700\n How do I make a living?\n\n41:06.700 --> 41:07.740\n How do I pay for my kids?\n\n41:07.740 --> 41:09.300\n All this stuff was in my mind,\n\n41:09.300 --> 41:10.640\n young graduate student making no money,\n\n41:10.640 --> 41:12.060\n thinking I got to get a job.\n\n41:12.060 --> 41:14.540\n And he said, well, I think just be like me\n\n41:14.540 --> 41:15.840\n and don't have kids, right?\n\n41:15.840 --> 41:17.080\n That's just, don't, don't.\n\n41:17.080 --> 41:18.540\n That's his take on it.\n\n41:18.540 --> 41:20.860\n That was what he said in that moment, right?\n\n41:20.860 --> 41:22.420\n That's the thing I read and I went,\n\n41:22.420 --> 41:24.960\n okay, this is a train I can't get on.\n\n41:24.960 --> 41:26.700\n There has to be a way to preserve the culture\n\n41:26.700 --> 41:29.180\n of open source and still be able to make sufficient money\n\n41:29.180 --> 41:30.020\n to feed your kids.\n\n41:30.020 --> 41:31.500\n Yes, exactly, there's gotta be.\n\n41:31.500 --> 41:34.500\n Well, so that actually led me to a study of economics.\n\n41:34.500 --> 41:36.680\n Because at the time I was ignorant and I really was.\n\n41:36.680 --> 41:39.420\n I'm actually, I'm embarrassed for educational system\n\n41:39.420 --> 41:41.300\n that they could let me and I was valedictorian\n\n41:41.300 --> 41:43.720\n in my high school class and I did super well in college.\n\n41:43.720 --> 41:47.620\n And like academically I did great, right?\n\n41:47.620 --> 41:49.980\n But the fact that I could do that and then be clueless\n\n41:49.980 --> 41:52.740\n about this key part of life,\n\n41:52.740 --> 41:54.400\n it led me to go, there's a problem.\n\n41:54.400 --> 41:56.660\n Like I should have learned this in fifth grade.\n\n41:56.660 --> 41:58.380\n I should have learned this in eighth grade.\n\n41:58.380 --> 41:59.220\n Like everybody should come out\n\n41:59.220 --> 42:01.700\n with a basic knowledge of economics.\n\n42:01.700 --> 42:04.040\n You're an interesting example because you've created tools\n\n42:04.040 --> 42:07.640\n that change the lives of probably millions of people\n\n42:07.640 --> 42:10.060\n and the fact that you don't understand at the time\n\n42:10.060 --> 42:12.860\n of the creation of those tools, the basics economics\n\n42:12.860 --> 42:15.260\n of how like to build up a giant system is the problem.\n\n42:15.260 --> 42:16.100\n Yeah, it's a problem.\n\n42:16.100 --> 42:18.260\n And so during my PhD at the same time,\n\n42:18.260 --> 42:20.720\n this is back in 98, 99 at the same time,\n\n42:20.720 --> 42:23.380\n I was in a library, I was reading books on capitalism,\n\n42:23.380 --> 42:24.700\n I was reading books on Marxism,\n\n42:24.700 --> 42:27.700\n I was reading books on what is this thing?\n\n42:27.700 --> 42:29.700\n What does it mean?\n\n42:29.700 --> 42:33.140\n And I encountered, basically I encountered a set of writings\n\n42:33.140 --> 42:35.500\n from people that said they were the inheritors of Adam Smith.\n\n42:35.500 --> 42:37.220\n Read Adam Smith for the first time, right?\n\n42:37.220 --> 42:38.580\n Which is the wealth of nations\n\n42:38.580 --> 42:42.460\n and kind of this notion of emergent societies\n\n42:42.460 --> 42:45.100\n and realized, oh, there's this whole world out here\n\n42:45.100 --> 42:49.460\n of people and the challenge of economics is also political.\n\n42:49.460 --> 42:53.940\n Like, cause economics, people, different parties\n\n42:53.940 --> 42:58.080\n running for office, they want their economic friends.\n\n42:58.080 --> 43:00.040\n They want their economists to back them up, right?\n\n43:00.040 --> 43:03.700\n Or to be their magicians, like the magicians\n\n43:03.700 --> 43:04.660\n in Pharaoh's court, right?\n\n43:04.660 --> 43:06.260\n The people that are kind of say, hey, this is,\n\n43:06.260 --> 43:08.100\n you should listen to me because I've got the expert\n\n43:08.100 --> 43:09.420\n who says this.\n\n43:09.420 --> 43:11.540\n And so it gets really muddled, right?\n\n43:11.540 --> 43:14.020\n But I was looking at it from as a scientist going,\n\n43:14.020 --> 43:14.860\n what is this space?\n\n43:14.860 --> 43:15.680\n What does this mean?\n\n43:15.680 --> 43:16.940\n How does Paris get fed?\n\n43:16.940 --> 43:18.420\n How does, what is money?\n\n43:18.420 --> 43:19.420\n How does it work?\n\n43:19.420 --> 43:21.580\n And I found a lot of writings that I really loved.\n\n43:21.580 --> 43:22.860\n I found some things that I really loved\n\n43:22.860 --> 43:23.980\n and I learned from that.\n\n43:23.980 --> 43:26.300\n It was writings from people like Von Missess.\n\n43:26.300 --> 43:29.060\n He wrote a paper in 1920 that still should be read\n\n43:29.060 --> 43:29.900\n more than it is.\n\n43:29.900 --> 43:33.060\n It was the economic calculation problem\n\n43:33.060 --> 43:34.560\n of the socialist commonwealth.\n\n43:34.560 --> 43:35.420\n It was basically in response\n\n43:35.420 --> 43:37.140\n to the Bolshevik revolution in 1917.\n\n43:37.140 --> 43:40.180\n And his basic argument was it's not gonna work\n\n43:40.180 --> 43:41.780\n to not have private property.\n\n43:41.780 --> 43:43.420\n You're not gonna be able to come up with prices.\n\n43:43.420 --> 43:45.200\n The bureaucrats aren't gonna be able to determine\n\n43:45.200 --> 43:47.620\n how to allocate resources without a price system.\n\n43:47.620 --> 43:51.700\n And a price system emerges from people making trades.\n\n43:51.700 --> 43:53.860\n And they can only make trades if they have authority\n\n43:53.860 --> 43:55.460\n over the thing they're trading.\n\n43:55.460 --> 43:58.020\n And that creates information flow\n\n43:58.020 --> 44:01.300\n that you just don't have if you try to top down it.\n\n44:01.300 --> 44:02.140\n Right.\n\n44:02.140 --> 44:04.780\n And it's like, huh, that's a really good point.\n\n44:04.780 --> 44:06.860\n Yeah, the prices have a signal that's used.\n\n44:06.860 --> 44:09.400\n And it's important to have that signal\n\n44:09.400 --> 44:11.020\n when you're trying to build a community\n\n44:11.020 --> 44:12.580\n of productive people like you would\n\n44:12.580 --> 44:13.700\n in the software engineering space.\n\n44:13.700 --> 44:14.860\n Yeah, the prices are actually\n\n44:14.860 --> 44:17.540\n an important signaling mechanism.\n\n44:17.540 --> 44:20.820\n Right, and that money is just a bartering tool.\n\n44:20.820 --> 44:22.540\n Right, so this is the first time I've encountered\n\n44:22.540 --> 44:24.440\n any of this concept, right, and the fact that,\n\n44:24.440 --> 44:26.600\n oh, this is actually really critical.\n\n44:26.600 --> 44:29.340\n Like it's so critical to our prosperity\n\n44:29.340 --> 44:34.100\n and that we're dangerously not learning about this,\n\n44:34.100 --> 44:36.140\n not teaching our children about this.\n\n44:36.140 --> 44:37.260\n So you had the three kids,\n\n44:37.260 --> 44:38.080\n you had to make some hard decisions.\n\n44:38.080 --> 44:39.880\n I had to make some money, right, had to figure it out.\n\n44:39.880 --> 44:40.720\n But I didn't really care.\n\n44:40.720 --> 44:43.260\n I mean, I've never been driven by money, just need it.\n\n44:43.260 --> 44:45.200\n Yeah, right, need to eat.\n\n44:45.200 --> 44:49.100\n So how did that resolve itself in terms of site buy?\n\n44:49.100 --> 44:51.320\n So I would say it didn't really resolve itself.\n\n44:51.320 --> 44:53.420\n It sort of started a journey that I'm continuing on.\n\n44:53.420 --> 44:54.740\n I'm still on, I would say.\n\n44:54.740 --> 44:55.660\n I don't think it resolved itself.\n\n44:55.660 --> 44:59.260\n But I will say I went in eyes wide open.\n\n44:59.260 --> 45:00.940\n Like I knew that there were problems\n\n45:00.940 --> 45:05.940\n with giving stuff away and creating the market externalities\n\n45:07.900 --> 45:09.780\n that the fact that, yeah, people might use it\n\n45:09.780 --> 45:10.820\n and I might not get paid for it\n\n45:10.820 --> 45:13.060\n and I'll have to figure something else out to get paid.\n\n45:13.060 --> 45:14.940\n Like at least I can say I'm not bitter\n\n45:14.940 --> 45:17.220\n that a lot of people have used stuff that I've written\n\n45:17.220 --> 45:20.240\n and I haven't necessarily benefited economically from it.\n\n45:20.240 --> 45:22.300\n I've heard other people be bitter about that\n\n45:22.300 --> 45:23.300\n when they write or they talk.\n\n45:23.300 --> 45:24.900\n Like, oh, I should've got more value out of this.\n\n45:24.900 --> 45:27.740\n And I'm also, I want to create systems\n\n45:27.740 --> 45:31.060\n that let people like me who might have these desires\n\n45:31.060 --> 45:32.260\n to do things, let them benefit.\n\n45:32.260 --> 45:34.700\n So it actually creates more of the same.\n\n45:34.700 --> 45:36.900\n Not to turn on your bitterness module,\n\n45:36.900 --> 45:40.940\n but there's some aspect, I wish there was mechanisms for me\n\n45:40.940 --> 45:43.580\n to reward whoever created side buy and non buy\n\n45:43.580 --> 45:45.300\n because it brought so much joy to my life.\n\n45:45.300 --> 45:46.140\n I appreciate that.\n\n45:46.140 --> 45:46.980\n You know what I mean?\n\n45:46.980 --> 45:48.340\n The tip dark notion was there.\n\n45:48.340 --> 45:49.180\n I appreciate that.\n\n45:49.180 --> 45:51.940\n But there should be a very frictionless mechanism.\n\n45:51.940 --> 45:52.760\n There should be a frictionless mechanism.\n\n45:52.760 --> 45:53.600\n I totally agree.\n\n45:53.600 --> 45:55.220\n I would love to talk about some of the ideas I have\n\n45:55.220 --> 45:56.220\n because I actually came across,\n\n45:56.220 --> 45:58.200\n I think I've come up with some interesting notions\n\n45:58.200 --> 46:01.860\n that could work, but they'll require anything that will work\n\n46:01.860 --> 46:03.740\n takes time to emerge, right?\n\n46:03.740 --> 46:04.940\n Like things don't just turn overnight.\n\n46:04.940 --> 46:06.340\n That's definitely one thing I've also understood\n\n46:06.340 --> 46:10.120\n and learned is any fixes, that's why it's kind of funny.\n\n46:10.120 --> 46:12.940\n We often give credit to, oh, this president gets elected\n\n46:12.940 --> 46:14.420\n and oh, look how great things have done.\n\n46:14.420 --> 46:18.340\n And I saw that when I had a transition in a condo\n\n46:18.340 --> 46:19.520\n when a new CEO came in, right?\n\n46:19.520 --> 46:22.340\n And it's like the success that's happening,\n\n46:22.340 --> 46:23.460\n there's an inertia there.\n\n46:23.460 --> 46:25.740\n Yeah, and sometimes the decision you made\n\n46:25.740 --> 46:28.980\n like 10 years before is the reason why the success is the.\n\n46:28.980 --> 46:29.820\n Right, exactly.\n\n46:29.820 --> 46:31.560\n So we're sort of just running around taking credit\n\n46:31.560 --> 46:32.400\n for stuff.\n\n46:32.400 --> 46:35.140\n The credit assignment has like a delay to it\n\n46:35.140 --> 46:38.320\n that makes the credit assignment basically wrong\n\n46:38.320 --> 46:39.160\n more than right.\n\n46:39.160 --> 46:40.320\n Wrong more than right, exactly.\n\n46:40.320 --> 46:42.140\n And so I'm like, oh, this is, you know,\n\n46:42.140 --> 46:44.860\n that's the stuff I would read a ton about, you know,\n\n46:44.860 --> 46:45.700\n early on.\n\n46:45.700 --> 46:47.720\n So I don't, I feel like I'm with you.\n\n46:47.720 --> 46:48.780\n Like I want the same thing.\n\n46:48.780 --> 46:50.900\n I want to be able to, and honestly, not for personally,\n\n46:50.900 --> 46:51.740\n I've been happy.\n\n46:51.740 --> 46:52.720\n I've been happy.\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:53.980\n I feel like I don't have any, I mean,\n\n46:53.980 --> 46:56.920\n we've been done reasonably okay, but I've had to pursue it.\n\n46:56.920 --> 47:01.380\n Like that's really what started my trajectory from academia\n\n47:01.380 --> 47:02.940\n is reading that stuff led me to say,\n\n47:02.940 --> 47:04.740\n oh, entrepreneurship matters.\n\n47:05.780 --> 47:09.180\n So I love software, but we need more entrepreneurs\n\n47:09.180 --> 47:10.360\n and I wanna understand that better.\n\n47:10.360 --> 47:14.940\n So once I kind of had that virus infect my brain,\n\n47:16.500 --> 47:17.580\n even though I was on a trajectory\n\n47:17.580 --> 47:20.640\n to go to a tenure track position at a university\n\n47:20.640 --> 47:22.780\n and I was there for six years,\n\n47:22.780 --> 47:26.060\n I was kind of already out the door when I started.\n\n47:26.060 --> 47:27.660\n And we can get into that, but.\n\n47:27.660 --> 47:30.340\n Well, can I just ask you a quick question on,\n\n47:30.340 --> 47:32.740\n is there some design principles\n\n47:32.740 --> 47:34.740\n that were in your mind around SciPy?\n\n47:34.740 --> 47:36.460\n Like, is there some key ideas\n\n47:36.460 --> 47:38.060\n that were just like sticking to you\n\n47:38.060 --> 47:40.300\n that this is the fundamental ideas?\n\n47:40.300 --> 47:41.140\n Yeah, I would say so.\n\n47:41.140 --> 47:43.680\n I would think it's basically accessibility to scientists,\n\n47:43.680 --> 47:46.980\n like give them, give scientists and engineers tools\n\n47:46.980 --> 47:48.380\n that they don't have to think a lot about programming.\n\n47:48.380 --> 47:50.300\n So give them really good building blocks,\n\n47:50.300 --> 47:51.860\n give them functions that they wanna call\n\n47:51.860 --> 47:54.360\n and sort of just the right length of spelling.\n\n47:55.860 --> 47:59.500\n There's one tradition in programming where it's like,\n\n47:59.500 --> 48:01.880\n make very, very long names, right?\n\n48:01.880 --> 48:03.700\n And you can see it in some programming languages\n\n48:03.700 --> 48:06.460\n where the names get, take half the screen.\n\n48:06.460 --> 48:11.460\n And in the 4chan world, characters had to be six letters\n\n48:11.540 --> 48:12.380\n early on, right?\n\n48:12.380 --> 48:14.340\n And that's way too much, too little.\n\n48:14.340 --> 48:16.820\n But I was like, I liked to have names\n\n48:16.820 --> 48:18.940\n that were informative but short.\n\n48:18.940 --> 48:22.340\n So even though Python, well this is a different conversation,\n\n48:22.340 --> 48:25.860\n but documentation is doing some work there.\n\n48:25.860 --> 48:29.180\n So when you look at great scientific libraries\n\n48:29.180 --> 48:32.700\n and functions, there's a richness of documentation\n\n48:32.700 --> 48:34.820\n that helps you get into the details.\n\n48:34.820 --> 48:37.620\n The first glance at a function gives you the intuition\n\n48:37.620 --> 48:40.540\n of all it needs to do by looking at the headers and so on.\n\n48:40.540 --> 48:43.420\n But to get the depths of all the complexities involved,\n\n48:43.420 --> 48:44.740\n all the options involved,\n\n48:44.740 --> 48:45.580\n documentation does some of the work.\n\n48:45.580 --> 48:47.380\n Documentation is essential, yeah.\n\n48:47.380 --> 48:50.520\n So that was actually a, so we thought about several things.\n\n48:50.520 --> 48:51.940\n One is we wanted plotting.\n\n48:51.940 --> 48:53.580\n We wanted interactive environment.\n\n48:53.580 --> 48:54.860\n We wanted good documentation.\n\n48:54.860 --> 48:56.780\n These are things we knew, we wanted.\n\n48:56.780 --> 49:00.460\n The reality is those took about 10 years to evolve, right?\n\n49:00.460 --> 49:02.060\n Given the fact that we didn't have a big budget,\n\n49:02.060 --> 49:03.100\n it was all volunteer labor.\n\n49:03.100 --> 49:06.980\n It was sort of, when nthought got created\n\n49:06.980 --> 49:10.060\n and they started to try to find projects,\n\n49:10.060 --> 49:11.080\n people would pay for pieces\n\n49:11.080 --> 49:13.740\n and they were able to fund some of it.\n\n49:13.740 --> 49:15.780\n Not nearly enough to keep up with what was necessary.\n\n49:15.780 --> 49:18.860\n And no criticism, just simply the reality.\n\n49:18.860 --> 49:21.180\n I mean, it's hard to start a business\n\n49:21.180 --> 49:23.220\n and then do consulting and then also\n\n49:23.220 --> 49:26.180\n promote an open source project that's still fairly new.\n\n49:26.180 --> 49:27.780\n Cypo is fairly niche.\n\n49:27.780 --> 49:30.140\n We stayed connected all while I was a student,\n\n49:30.140 --> 49:30.980\n sorry, a professor.\n\n49:30.980 --> 49:32.340\n I went to BYU and started to teach.\n\n49:32.340 --> 49:35.060\n Electrical engineering, all the applied math courses.\n\n49:35.060 --> 49:36.980\n I loved teaching single processing,\n\n49:36.980 --> 49:39.180\n probability theory, electromagnetism.\n\n49:39.180 --> 49:40.940\n I was, if you look at writing my professor,\n\n49:40.940 --> 49:42.500\n which my kids loved to do,\n\n49:42.500 --> 49:46.900\n I wasn't, I got some bad reviews because people.\n\n49:46.900 --> 49:48.580\n What was the criticism?\n\n49:48.580 --> 49:50.920\n I would speak too high of a level.\n\n49:50.920 --> 49:52.640\n Like I definitely had a calibration problem\n\n49:52.640 --> 49:54.980\n coming out of graduate work\n\n49:54.980 --> 49:56.980\n where I hate to be condescending to people.\n\n49:56.980 --> 49:59.300\n Like I really have a ton of respect for people fundamentally.\n\n49:59.300 --> 50:02.060\n Like my fundamental thing is I respect people.\n\n50:02.060 --> 50:03.900\n Sometimes that can lead to a,\n\n50:03.900 --> 50:07.640\n I was thinking they had more knowledge than they did.\n\n50:07.640 --> 50:10.100\n And so I would just speak at a very high level,\n\n50:10.100 --> 50:11.060\n assume they got it.\n\n50:11.060 --> 50:14.340\n But they need to rise to the standard that you set.\n\n50:14.340 --> 50:15.260\n I mean, that's one of the,\n\n50:15.260 --> 50:17.180\n some of the greatest teachers do that.\n\n50:17.180 --> 50:18.020\n And I agree.\n\n50:18.020 --> 50:19.760\n And that was kind of what was inspiring me.\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:21.300\n But you also have to,\n\n50:22.160 --> 50:24.820\n I cannot say I was articulate\n\n50:24.820 --> 50:26.300\n with some of the greatest teachers, right?\n\n50:26.300 --> 50:28.540\n I was, like one classic example,\n\n50:28.540 --> 50:30.420\n when I first taught at BYU,\n\n50:30.420 --> 50:31.980\n my very first class, it was overheads,\n\n50:31.980 --> 50:34.100\n transparencies, overheads.\n\n50:34.100 --> 50:35.940\n Before projectors were really that common,\n\n50:35.940 --> 50:37.100\n I taught transparencies.\n\n50:37.100 --> 50:38.260\n I'm writing my notes out.\n\n50:38.260 --> 50:40.540\n I go in, room's half dark.\n\n50:40.540 --> 50:42.780\n I just blaring through these transparencies.\n\n50:42.780 --> 50:44.900\n Here it is, here it is, here it is.\n\n50:44.900 --> 50:47.480\n And I did give a quiz after two weeks.\n\n50:47.480 --> 50:48.900\n No one knew anything.\n\n50:48.900 --> 50:50.940\n Nothing I had taught had gotten anywhere.\n\n50:50.940 --> 50:54.140\n And I realized, okay, I'm not, this is not working.\n\n50:54.140 --> 50:56.380\n So I put away the transparencies\n\n50:56.380 --> 50:58.860\n and I turned around and just started using the chalkboard.\n\n50:58.860 --> 51:00.980\n And what it did is it slowed me down, right?\n\n51:00.980 --> 51:02.260\n The chalkboard just slowed me down\n\n51:02.260 --> 51:04.440\n and gave people time to process and to think.\n\n51:04.440 --> 51:06.080\n And then that made me focus.\n\n51:06.080 --> 51:07.900\n My writing wasn't great on the chalkboard,\n\n51:07.900 --> 51:10.520\n but I really love that part of like the teaching.\n\n51:10.520 --> 51:12.500\n So that entered SciPy's world in terms of,\n\n51:12.500 --> 51:14.860\n we always understood that there's a didactic aspect\n\n51:14.860 --> 51:17.740\n of SciPy, kind of how do you take the knowledge\n\n51:17.740 --> 51:18.640\n and then produce it?\n\n51:18.640 --> 51:21.020\n The challenge we had was the scope.\n\n51:21.020 --> 51:23.420\n Like ultimately SciPy was everything, right?\n\n51:23.420 --> 51:25.600\n And so 2001, when it first came out,\n\n51:25.600 --> 51:26.800\n people were starting to use it.\n\n51:26.800 --> 51:29.580\n No, this is cool, this is a tool we actually use.\n\n51:29.580 --> 51:31.400\n At the same time, 2001 timeframe,\n\n51:31.400 --> 51:33.940\n there was a little bit of like the Hubble Space Telescope,\n\n51:33.940 --> 51:35.400\n the folks at Hubble that started to say,\n\n51:35.400 --> 51:36.620\n hey, Python, we're gonna use Python\n\n51:36.620 --> 51:38.720\n for processing images from Hubble.\n\n51:38.720 --> 51:40.820\n And so Perry Greenfield was a good friend\n\n51:40.820 --> 51:42.420\n in running that program.\n\n51:42.420 --> 51:45.060\n And he had called me before I left WIU and said,\n\n51:45.060 --> 51:47.020\n you know, we wanna do this,\n\n51:47.020 --> 51:50.020\n but numeric actually has some challenges in terms of,\n\n51:50.020 --> 51:52.700\n you know, it's not, the array doesn't have enough types.\n\n51:52.700 --> 51:54.280\n We need more operations.\n\n51:54.280 --> 51:56.660\n You know, broadcasting needs to be a little more settled.\n\n51:56.660 --> 51:57.960\n They wanted record arrays.\n\n51:57.960 --> 52:00.600\n They wanted, you know, record arrays are like a data frame,\n\n52:00.600 --> 52:02.220\n but a little bit different,\n\n52:02.220 --> 52:03.820\n but they wanted more structured data.\n\n52:03.820 --> 52:06.020\n So he had called me even early on then,\n\n52:06.020 --> 52:06.860\n and he said, you know, what,\n\n52:06.860 --> 52:08.300\n would you wanna work on something to make this work?\n\n52:08.300 --> 52:10.140\n And I said, yeah, I'm interested, but I'm going here,\n\n52:10.140 --> 52:12.100\n and I, you know, we'll see if I have time.\n\n52:12.100 --> 52:13.340\n So in the meantime, while I was teaching\n\n52:13.340 --> 52:15.660\n and SciPy was emerging, and I had a student,\n\n52:15.660 --> 52:16.840\n I was constantly, while I was teaching,\n\n52:16.840 --> 52:18.840\n trying to figure a way to fund this stuff.\n\n52:18.840 --> 52:21.660\n So I had a graduate student, my only graduate student,\n\n52:21.660 --> 52:26.260\n a Chinese fellow, Liu Hongze is his name, great guy.\n\n52:26.260 --> 52:29.900\n He wrote a bunch of stuff for iterative linear algebra,\n\n52:29.900 --> 52:31.380\n like got into writing some of the iterative\n\n52:31.380 --> 52:34.340\n linear algebra tools that are currently there in SciPy,\n\n52:34.340 --> 52:36.040\n and they've gotten better since,\n\n52:36.040 --> 52:39.260\n but this is in 2005, kept working on SciPy,\n\n52:39.260 --> 52:43.060\n but Perry has started working on a replacement\n\n52:43.060 --> 52:45.300\n to numeric called NumArray.\n\n52:45.300 --> 52:49.020\n And in 2004, a package called ND Image,\n\n52:49.020 --> 52:50.740\n it was an image processing library\n\n52:50.740 --> 52:53.220\n that was written for NumArray,\n\n52:53.220 --> 52:55.580\n and it had in it a morphology tool.\n\n52:55.580 --> 52:56.740\n I don't know if you know what morphology is.\n\n52:56.740 --> 52:58.540\n It's open, dilations, closed, you know,\n\n52:58.540 --> 53:01.660\n there was sort of this, as a medical imaging student,\n\n53:01.660 --> 53:02.500\n I knew what it was,\n\n53:02.500 --> 53:04.420\n because it was used in segmentation a lot.\n\n53:04.420 --> 53:06.460\n And in fact, I'd wanted to do something like that\n\n53:06.460 --> 53:10.220\n in Python, in SciPy, but just had never gotten around to it.\n\n53:10.220 --> 53:14.180\n So when it came out, but it worked only on NumArray,\n\n53:14.180 --> 53:16.420\n and SciPy needed numeric,\n\n53:16.420 --> 53:20.040\n and so we effectively had the beginning of this split.\n\n53:20.040 --> 53:22.500\n And numeric and NumArray didn't share data,\n\n53:22.500 --> 53:24.420\n they were just two, so you could have a gigabyte\n\n53:24.420 --> 53:26.540\n of numeric, NumArray data, and gigabyte of numeric data,\n\n53:26.540 --> 53:27.380\n and they wouldn't share it.\n\n53:27.380 --> 53:28.500\n And so you had these,\n\n53:28.500 --> 53:31.300\n then you had these scientific libraries written on top.\n\n53:31.300 --> 53:32.940\n I got really bugged by that.\n\n53:32.940 --> 53:35.060\n I got really like, oh man, this is not good,\n\n53:35.060 --> 53:36.300\n we're not cooperating now,\n\n53:36.300 --> 53:37.980\n we're sort of redoing each other's work,\n\n53:37.980 --> 53:40.380\n and we're just this young community.\n\n53:40.380 --> 53:43.940\n So that's what led me, even though I knew it was risky,\n\n53:43.940 --> 53:47.140\n because my, you know, I was on a tenure track position,\n\n53:47.140 --> 53:48.540\n 2004 I got reviewed.\n\n53:48.540 --> 53:49.540\n They said, hey, things are going okay,\n\n53:49.540 --> 53:51.540\n you're doing well, paper's coming out,\n\n53:51.540 --> 53:52.460\n but you're kind of spending a lot of time\n\n53:52.460 --> 53:54.780\n doing this open source stuff, maybe do a little less of that,\n\n53:54.780 --> 53:57.260\n and a little more of the paper writing and grant writing,\n\n53:57.260 --> 54:00.860\n which was naive, but it was definitely the thinking.\n\n54:00.860 --> 54:01.700\n It still goes on.\n\n54:01.700 --> 54:03.060\n Still goes on.\n\n54:03.060 --> 54:05.120\n You're basically creating a thing\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:08.300\n which enables science in the 21st century.\n\n54:08.300 --> 54:09.340\n Right.\n\n54:09.340 --> 54:11.980\n Maybe don't emphasize that so much in your free year tenure.\n\n54:11.980 --> 54:13.460\n Right.\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:14.860\n It illustrates some of the challenges.\n\n54:14.860 --> 54:15.700\n Yes.\n\n54:15.700 --> 54:18.220\n It does, and it's, people mean well.\n\n54:18.220 --> 54:19.060\n Yes.\n\n54:19.060 --> 54:22.340\n Like, but we've gotten broken in a bunch of ways.\n\n54:22.340 --> 54:23.660\n Certain things, programming,\n\n54:23.660 --> 54:25.500\n understanding the role of software engineering,\n\n54:25.500 --> 54:27.860\n programming in society is a little bit lacking.\n\n54:27.860 --> 54:28.700\n Exactly.\n\n54:28.700 --> 54:30.020\n Now, I was in electrical engineering position.\n\n54:30.020 --> 54:30.860\n Right.\n\n54:30.860 --> 54:33.140\n That's even worse there.\n\n54:33.140 --> 54:34.700\n Yeah, it was very, they were very focused,\n\n54:34.700 --> 54:37.300\n and so, you know, good people, and I had a great time,\n\n54:37.300 --> 54:38.940\n I loved my time, I loved my teaching,\n\n54:38.940 --> 54:40.460\n I loved all the things I did there.\n\n54:40.460 --> 54:42.540\n The problem was, the split was happening\n\n54:42.540 --> 54:43.940\n in this community that I loved, right?\n\n54:43.940 --> 54:45.460\n I saw people, and I went, oh my gosh,\n\n54:45.460 --> 54:47.780\n this is gonna be, this is not great,\n\n54:47.780 --> 54:50.020\n and so I happened, you know, fate,\n\n54:50.020 --> 54:52.620\n I had a class I had signed up for,\n\n54:52.620 --> 54:54.860\n it's a, I was trying to build an MRI system,\n\n54:54.860 --> 54:58.300\n so I had a kind of a radio, instead of a radio,\n\n54:58.300 --> 55:00.780\n a digital radio class, it was a digital MRI class.\n\n55:01.820 --> 55:04.020\n And I had people sign up, two people signed up,\n\n55:04.020 --> 55:06.660\n then they dropped, and so I had nobody in this class.\n\n55:06.660 --> 55:08.820\n So, and I didn't have any other courses to teach,\n\n55:08.820 --> 55:10.940\n and I thought, oh, I've got some time,\n\n55:10.940 --> 55:13.100\n and I'll just write, I'll just write a replace,\n\n55:13.100 --> 55:14.820\n a merger of Numerica Numeray.\n\n55:14.820 --> 55:16.980\n Like, I'll basically take the numeric code base\n\n55:16.980 --> 55:19.220\n at the features Numeray was adding,\n\n55:19.220 --> 55:21.180\n and then kind of come up with a single array library\n\n55:21.180 --> 55:22.460\n that everybody can use.\n\n55:22.460 --> 55:24.140\n So that's where NumPy came from,\n\n55:24.140 --> 55:26.500\n was my thinking, hey, I can do this,\n\n55:26.500 --> 55:27.860\n and who else is going to?\n\n55:27.860 --> 55:29.260\n Because at that point, I'd been around the community\n\n55:29.260 --> 55:30.820\n long enough, and I'd written enough C code,\n\n55:30.820 --> 55:33.260\n I knew, I knew the structures, and I,\n\n55:33.260 --> 55:35.060\n in fact, my first contribution to numeric\n\n55:35.060 --> 55:38.580\n had been writing the CAPI documentation\n\n55:38.580 --> 55:41.080\n that went in the first documentation for NumPy,\n\n55:41.080 --> 55:43.020\n for numeric, sorry, this is Paul DuBois,\n\n55:43.020 --> 55:45.100\n David Asher, Conrad Hinson, and myself.\n\n55:45.100 --> 55:47.580\n I got credit because I wrote this chapter,\n\n55:47.580 --> 55:51.260\n which is all the CAPI of Numerica, all the C stuff.\n\n55:51.260 --> 55:53.380\n So I said, I'm probably the one to do it,\n\n55:53.380 --> 55:54.760\n and nobody else is gonna do this.\n\n55:54.760 --> 55:58.340\n So it was sort of, out of a sense of duty and passion,\n\n55:58.340 --> 56:01.460\n knowing that, eh, I don't think my academic,\n\n56:01.460 --> 56:03.940\n I don't think the department here is gonna appreciate this,\n\n56:03.940 --> 56:06.020\n but it's the right thing to do.\n\n56:06.020 --> 56:06.860\n It was like.\n\n56:06.860 --> 56:08.660\n Can we just link on that moment?\n\n56:08.660 --> 56:09.500\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n56:09.500 --> 56:11.740\n Because the importance of the way you thought\n\n56:11.740 --> 56:16.360\n and the action you took, I feel is understated\n\n56:16.360 --> 56:19.900\n and is rare and I would love to see so much more of it\n\n56:19.900 --> 56:23.680\n because what happens as the tools become more popular,\n\n56:24.820 --> 56:27.180\n there's a split that happens.\n\n56:27.180 --> 56:30.940\n And it's a truly heroic and impactful action\n\n56:30.940 --> 56:33.580\n to in those early, in that early split,\n\n56:33.580 --> 56:37.820\n to step up and it's like great leaders throughout history,\n\n56:37.820 --> 56:39.660\n like get, what is the brave heart,\n\n56:39.660 --> 56:42.500\n like get on a horse and rile the troops\n\n56:42.500 --> 56:46.060\n because I think that can have, make a big difference.\n\n56:46.060 --> 56:48.180\n We have TensorFlow versus PyTorch\n\n56:48.180 --> 56:49.100\n in the machine learning community.\n\n56:49.100 --> 56:50.380\n We have the same problem today.\n\n56:50.380 --> 56:51.780\n Yeah, I wonder.\n\n56:51.780 --> 56:52.620\n It's actually bigger.\n\n56:52.620 --> 56:56.620\n I wonder if it's possible in the early days\n\n56:56.620 --> 56:58.220\n to rally the troops.\n\n56:58.220 --> 57:00.020\n It is possible, especially in the early days.\n\n57:00.020 --> 57:01.620\n The longer it goes, the harder, right?\n\n57:01.620 --> 57:03.940\n The more energy in the factions, the harder.\n\n57:03.940 --> 57:05.700\n But in the early days, it is possible\n\n57:05.700 --> 57:07.660\n and it's extremely helpful\n\n57:07.660 --> 57:09.100\n and there's a willingness there,\n\n57:09.100 --> 57:11.740\n but the challenge is there's just not a willingness\n\n57:11.740 --> 57:12.980\n to fund it.\n\n57:12.980 --> 57:14.880\n There's not a willingness to, you know,\n\n57:14.880 --> 57:17.540\n like I was literally walking into a field\n\n57:17.540 --> 57:18.620\n saying I'm going to do this\n\n57:18.620 --> 57:20.140\n and here I am, like, you know,\n\n57:20.140 --> 57:22.080\n I have five kids at home now.\n\n57:23.740 --> 57:24.820\n Pressure builds.\n\n57:24.820 --> 57:26.220\n Sometimes my wife hears these stories\n\n57:26.220 --> 57:28.100\n and she's like, you did what?\n\n57:29.020 --> 57:29.860\n I thought we were going to,\n\n57:29.860 --> 57:31.460\n I thought you were actually on a path\n\n57:31.460 --> 57:34.100\n to make sure we had resources and money, but,\n\n57:34.100 --> 57:36.420\n but again, there's a, there's an aspect,\n\n57:36.420 --> 57:37.860\n I'm a very hopeful person.\n\n57:37.860 --> 57:39.680\n I'm an optimistic person by nature.\n\n57:39.680 --> 57:41.120\n I love people.\n\n57:41.120 --> 57:43.140\n I learned that about myself later on.\n\n57:43.140 --> 57:47.220\n And part of my, my religious beliefs\n\n57:47.220 --> 57:48.380\n actually lead to that.\n\n57:48.380 --> 57:49.880\n And it's why I hold them dear\n\n57:49.880 --> 57:51.300\n because it's actually how I feel about,\n\n57:51.300 --> 57:53.420\n that's what leads me to these attitudes,\n\n57:53.420 --> 57:55.900\n sort of this hopefulness and this sense of,\n\n57:55.900 --> 57:58.600\n yeah, it may not work out for me financially\n\n57:58.600 --> 58:00.600\n or maybe, but that's not the ultimate gain.\n\n58:00.600 --> 58:02.940\n Like that's a thing, but it's not,\n\n58:02.940 --> 58:05.540\n that's not the scorecard for me.\n\n58:05.540 --> 58:07.060\n And so I just wanted to be helpful\n\n58:07.060 --> 58:09.280\n and I knew, and partly because these SciPy conferences,\n\n58:09.280 --> 58:10.860\n because the maintenance conversations,\n\n58:10.860 --> 58:13.300\n I knew there was a lot of need for this, right?\n\n58:13.300 --> 58:15.460\n And so I had this, it wasn't like I was alone\n\n58:15.460 --> 58:16.460\n in terms of no feedback.\n\n58:16.460 --> 58:19.440\n I had these people who knew, but it was crazy.\n\n58:19.440 --> 58:20.700\n Like people who at the time said,\n\n58:20.700 --> 58:22.340\n yeah, we didn't think you'd be able to do it.\n\n58:22.340 --> 58:23.160\n We thought it was crazy.\n\n58:23.160 --> 58:26.720\n And also instructive, like practically speaking,\n\n58:26.720 --> 58:28.700\n that you had a cool feature\n\n58:28.700 --> 58:30.820\n that you were chasing the morphology, like the.\n\n58:30.820 --> 58:31.660\n Yes.\n\n58:31.660 --> 58:32.500\n Like it's not just like.\n\n58:32.500 --> 58:33.460\n There's an end result.\n\n58:33.460 --> 58:35.140\n It's not some visionary thing.\n\n58:35.140 --> 58:36.820\n I'm going to unite the community.\n\n58:36.820 --> 58:38.060\n You were like. Correct.\n\n58:38.060 --> 58:39.520\n You were actually practically,\n\n58:39.520 --> 58:42.100\n this is what one person actually could do\n\n58:42.100 --> 58:43.220\n and actually build.\n\n58:43.220 --> 58:44.220\n Cause that is important.\n\n58:44.220 --> 58:46.320\n Cause you can get over your skis.\n\n58:47.460 --> 58:49.060\n You can definitely get over your skis.\n\n58:49.060 --> 58:52.140\n And I had, in fact, this almost got me over my skis, right?\n\n58:52.140 --> 58:54.940\n I would say, well, in retrospect, I hate looking back.\n\n58:56.140 --> 58:58.540\n I can tell you all the flaws with NumPy, right?\n\n58:58.540 --> 59:00.700\n When I go into it, there's lots of stuff that I'm like,\n\n59:00.700 --> 59:01.660\n oh man, that's embarrassing.\n\n59:01.660 --> 59:02.500\n That was wrong.\n\n59:02.500 --> 59:04.300\n I wish I had somebody stop me with a wet fish there.\n\n59:04.300 --> 59:07.020\n Like I needed, like what I'd wished I'd had\n\n59:07.020 --> 59:10.460\n was somebody with more experience and certainly library\n\n59:10.460 --> 59:11.540\n writing and array library.\n\n59:11.540 --> 59:12.780\n There's like, I wish I had me.\n\n59:12.780 --> 59:14.520\n I could go back in time and go do this, do that.\n\n59:14.520 --> 59:15.480\n There's a more important thing.\n\n59:15.480 --> 59:18.100\n Cause there's things we did that are still there\n\n59:18.100 --> 59:20.940\n that are problematic, that created challenges for later.\n\n59:20.940 --> 59:22.460\n And I didn't know it at the time.\n\n59:22.460 --> 59:24.420\n Didn't understand how important that was.\n\n59:24.420 --> 59:26.460\n And in many cases, didn't know what to do.\n\n59:26.460 --> 59:29.060\n Like there was pieces of the design of NumPy.\n\n59:29.060 --> 59:31.340\n I didn't know what to do until five years ago.\n\n59:31.340 --> 59:32.860\n Now I know what they should have been, Ben.\n\n59:32.860 --> 59:33.960\n But I didn't know at the time and nobody,\n\n59:33.960 --> 59:35.380\n and I couldn't get the help.\n\n59:35.380 --> 59:36.660\n Anyway, so I wrote it.\n\n59:36.660 --> 59:38.780\n It took about, it took four months to write\n\n59:38.780 --> 59:43.360\n the first version, then about 14 months to make it usable.\n\n59:43.360 --> 59:45.860\n But it was, it wasn't, it was that first four months\n\n59:45.860 --> 59:49.320\n of intense writing, coding, getting something out the door\n\n59:49.320 --> 59:52.380\n that worked that was, it was, it was definitely challenging.\n\n59:52.380 --> 59:54.900\n And then the big thing I did was create a new type object\n\n59:54.900 --> 59:56.100\n called D type.\n\n59:56.100 --> 59:58.780\n That was probably the contribution.\n\n59:58.780 --> 1:00:01.900\n And then the fact that I added broad, not just broadcasting,\n\n1:00:01.900 --> 1:00:06.500\n but advanced indexing so that you could do masked indexing\n\n1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:09.940\n and indirect indexing instead of just slicing.\n\n1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:13.020\n So for people who don't know, and maybe you can elaborate,\n\n1:00:13.020 --> 1:00:17.660\n NumPy, I guess the vision in the narrowest sense\n\n1:00:17.660 --> 1:00:21.460\n is to have this object that represents\n\n1:00:21.460 --> 1:00:23.180\n n dimensional arrays.\n\n1:00:23.180 --> 1:00:26.300\n And like at any level of abstraction you want,\n\n1:00:26.300 --> 1:00:28.220\n but basically it could be a black box\n\n1:00:28.220 --> 1:00:30.940\n that you can investigate in ways that you would naturally\n\n1:00:30.940 --> 1:00:33.340\n want to investigate such objects.\n\n1:00:33.340 --> 1:00:34.180\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:00:34.180 --> 1:00:35.740\n So you could do math on it easily.\n\n1:00:35.740 --> 1:00:37.180\n Math on it easily, yeah.\n\n1:00:37.180 --> 1:00:39.860\n So it had an associated library of math operations\n\n1:00:39.860 --> 1:00:43.220\n and effectively SciPy became an even larger operate set\n\n1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:44.940\n of math operations.\n\n1:00:44.940 --> 1:00:48.020\n So the key for me was I was going to write NumPy\n\n1:00:48.020 --> 1:00:50.340\n and then move SciPy to depend on NumPy.\n\n1:00:50.340 --> 1:00:52.980\n In fact, early on, one of the initial proposals\n\n1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:54.540\n was that we would just write SciPy\n\n1:00:54.540 --> 1:00:56.660\n and it would have the numeric object inside of it.\n\n1:00:56.660 --> 1:00:59.780\n And it'd be SciPy.array or something.\n\n1:00:59.780 --> 1:01:02.180\n That turned out to be problematic because numeric\n\n1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:04.820\n already had a little mini library of linear algebra\n\n1:01:04.820 --> 1:01:08.020\n and some functions, and it had enough momentum,\n\n1:01:08.020 --> 1:01:10.340\n enough users that nobody wanted to,\n\n1:01:10.340 --> 1:01:12.060\n they wanted backward compatibility.\n\n1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:13.740\n One of the big challenges of NumPy\n\n1:01:13.740 --> 1:01:14.980\n was I had to be backward compatible\n\n1:01:14.980 --> 1:01:16.980\n with both numeric and NumArray\n\n1:01:16.980 --> 1:01:19.300\n in order to allow both of those communities to come together.\n\n1:01:19.300 --> 1:01:21.140\n There was a ton of work in creating\n\n1:01:21.140 --> 1:01:22.580\n that backward compatibility\n\n1:01:22.580 --> 1:01:25.420\n that also created echoes in today's object.\n\n1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:27.180\n Like some of the complexity in today's object\n\n1:01:27.180 --> 1:01:30.060\n is actually from that goal of backward compatibility\n\n1:01:30.060 --> 1:01:31.380\n to these other communities,\n\n1:01:31.380 --> 1:01:34.620\n which if you didn't have that, you'd do something different,\n\n1:01:34.620 --> 1:01:37.740\n which is instructive because a lot of things are there.\n\n1:01:37.740 --> 1:01:38.940\n You think, what is that there for?\n\n1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:41.380\n It's like, well, it's a remnant.\n\n1:01:41.380 --> 1:01:45.220\n It's an artifact of its historical existence.\n\n1:01:45.220 --> 1:01:46.780\n By the way, I love the empathy\n\n1:01:46.780 --> 1:01:48.460\n and the lack of ego behind that\n\n1:01:48.460 --> 1:01:51.420\n because I feel, you see that in the split\n\n1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:53.340\n in the JavaScript framework, for example,\n\n1:01:53.340 --> 1:01:54.860\n the arbitrary branching.\n\n1:01:54.860 --> 1:01:55.700\n Right.\n\n1:01:56.980 --> 1:01:59.020\n I think in order to unite people,\n\n1:01:59.020 --> 1:02:00.620\n you have to kind of put your ego aside\n\n1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:02.260\n and truly listen to others.\n\n1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:03.100\n You do.\n\n1:02:03.100 --> 1:02:04.820\n What do you love about NumArray?\n\n1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:06.020\n What do you love about Numeric?\n\n1:02:06.020 --> 1:02:07.460\n Like actually get a sense,\n\n1:02:07.460 --> 1:02:08.860\n we were talking about languages earlier,\n\n1:02:08.860 --> 1:02:11.100\n sort of empathize to the culture,\n\n1:02:11.100 --> 1:02:14.660\n the people that love something about this particular API,\n\n1:02:14.660 --> 1:02:18.100\n some of the naming style\n\n1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:21.220\n or the actual usage patterns\n\n1:02:21.220 --> 1:02:22.820\n and truly understand them\n\n1:02:22.820 --> 1:02:26.780\n and so that you can create that same draw\n\n1:02:26.780 --> 1:02:28.620\n in the united thing. I completely agree.\n\n1:02:28.620 --> 1:02:29.460\n I completely agree.\n\n1:02:29.460 --> 1:02:31.780\n And you have to also have enough passion\n\n1:02:31.780 --> 1:02:32.620\n that you'll do it.\n\n1:02:32.620 --> 1:02:34.660\n It can't be just like a perfunctory,\n\n1:02:34.660 --> 1:02:36.500\n oh yes, I'll listen to you\n\n1:02:36.500 --> 1:02:38.380\n and then I'm not really that excited about it.\n\n1:02:38.380 --> 1:02:39.620\n So it really is an aspect,\n\n1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:42.260\n it's a philosophical, like there's a philia,\n\n1:02:42.260 --> 1:02:44.260\n there's a love of esteeming of others.\n\n1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:47.060\n It's actually at the heart of what,\n\n1:02:47.060 --> 1:02:49.220\n it's sort of a life philosophy for me, right?\n\n1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:51.540\n That I'm constantly pursuing and that helped,\n\n1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:52.660\n absolutely helped.\n\n1:02:52.660 --> 1:02:54.260\n Makes me wonder in a philosophical,\n\n1:02:54.260 --> 1:02:57.460\n like looking at human civilization as one object,\n\n1:02:57.460 --> 1:02:59.980\n it makes me wonder how we can copy and paste Travis's\n\n1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:00.820\n in this book.\n\n1:03:00.820 --> 1:03:03.300\n Well, some aspects, maybe.\n\n1:03:03.300 --> 1:03:05.220\n Some aspects, right, right, exactly.\n\n1:03:05.220 --> 1:03:07.300\n Well, it's a good question.\n\n1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:08.140\n How do we teach this?\n\n1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:09.300\n How do we encourage it?\n\n1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:10.140\n How do we lift it?\n\n1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:12.700\n Because so much of the software world,\n\n1:03:12.700 --> 1:03:15.140\n it's giant communities, right?\n\n1:03:15.140 --> 1:03:16.820\n But it seems like so much is moved by,\n\n1:03:16.820 --> 1:03:18.180\n like little individuals.\n\n1:03:18.180 --> 1:03:21.020\n You talk about like Linus Torvalds.\n\n1:03:21.020 --> 1:03:23.380\n It's like, could you have not,\n\n1:03:23.380 --> 1:03:25.980\n could you have had Linux without him?\n\n1:03:25.980 --> 1:03:26.820\n Could you?\n\n1:03:26.820 --> 1:03:28.140\n Yeah, Guido and Python.\n\n1:03:28.140 --> 1:03:28.980\n Guido and Python.\n\n1:03:28.980 --> 1:03:29.820\n Guido and Python.\n\n1:03:29.820 --> 1:03:30.980\n Well, the iPy community particularly,\n\n1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:32.820\n it's like I said, we wanted to build this big thing,\n\n1:03:32.820 --> 1:03:33.780\n but ultimately we didn't.\n\n1:03:33.780 --> 1:03:36.060\n What happened is we had Mavericks and champions\n\n1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:37.780\n like John Hunter who created Matplotlib.\n\n1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:39.940\n We had Fernando Perez who created iPython.\n\n1:03:39.940 --> 1:03:42.260\n And so we sort of inspired each other,\n\n1:03:42.260 --> 1:03:43.980\n but then it kind of, there's sort of a culture\n\n1:03:43.980 --> 1:03:47.820\n of this selfless giving, the stewardship mentality,\n\n1:03:47.820 --> 1:03:49.140\n as opposed to ownership mentality,\n\n1:03:49.140 --> 1:03:54.040\n but stewardship and community focused,\n\n1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:56.620\n community focused, but intentional work.\n\n1:03:56.620 --> 1:03:58.900\n Like not waiting for everybody else to do the work,\n\n1:03:58.900 --> 1:04:00.700\n but you're doing it for the benefit of others\n\n1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:02.900\n and not worried about what you're gonna get.\n\n1:04:04.020 --> 1:04:04.860\n You're not worried about the credit.\n\n1:04:04.860 --> 1:04:05.860\n You're not worried about what you're gonna get.\n\n1:04:05.860 --> 1:04:07.580\n You're worried about, I later realized\n\n1:04:07.580 --> 1:04:09.000\n that I have to worry a little about credit,\n\n1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.300\n not because I want the credit,\n\n1:04:10.300 --> 1:04:11.380\n because I want people to understand\n\n1:04:11.380 --> 1:04:13.020\n what led to the results.\n\n1:04:13.020 --> 1:04:15.060\n Like, I don't, it's not about me.\n\n1:04:15.060 --> 1:04:17.540\n It's I want to understand this is what led to the result.\n\n1:04:17.540 --> 1:04:18.980\n So let's like, I think doing,\n\n1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:21.100\n and this is what had no impact on the result.\n\n1:04:21.100 --> 1:04:23.420\n Like let's promote, just like you said,\n\n1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:25.100\n I want to promote the attributes\n\n1:04:25.100 --> 1:04:26.520\n that help make us better off.\n\n1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:28.820\n How do we make more of West McKinney?\n\n1:04:28.820 --> 1:04:31.620\n Like West McKinney was critical to the success of Python\n\n1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:33.420\n because of his creation of pandas,\n\n1:04:33.420 --> 1:04:36.420\n which is the roots of that were all the way back\n\n1:04:36.420 --> 1:04:40.260\n in numeric and num array and numpy,\n\n1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:43.180\n where numpy created an array of records.\n\n1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:45.980\n West started to use that almost like a data frame,\n\n1:04:45.980 --> 1:04:47.840\n except it's an array of records.\n\n1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:49.780\n And data frame, the challenge is,\n\n1:04:49.780 --> 1:04:52.240\n okay, if you want to augment it at another column,\n\n1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:54.700\n you have to insert, you have to do all this memory movement\n\n1:04:54.700 --> 1:04:55.660\n to insert a column.\n\n1:04:55.660 --> 1:04:57.180\n Whereas data frames became,\n\n1:04:57.180 --> 1:05:00.460\n oh, I'm going to have a loose collection of arrays.\n\n1:05:00.460 --> 1:05:03.980\n So it's a record of arrays that is a part of a data frame.\n\n1:05:03.980 --> 1:05:05.560\n And we thought about that back in the memory days,\n\n1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:08.940\n but West ended up doing the work to build it.\n\n1:05:08.940 --> 1:05:11.300\n And then also the operations that were relevant\n\n1:05:11.300 --> 1:05:12.620\n for data processing.\n\n1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:15.220\n What I noticed is just that each of these little things\n\n1:05:15.220 --> 1:05:17.380\n creates just another tick, another up.\n\n1:05:17.380 --> 1:05:19.940\n So numpy ultimately took a little while,\n\n1:05:19.940 --> 1:05:22.700\n about six months in, people started to join me,\n\n1:05:22.700 --> 1:05:27.300\n Francesc Altad, Robert Kern, Charles Harris.\n\n1:05:27.300 --> 1:05:30.300\n And these people are many of the unsung heroes, I would say.\n\n1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:31.980\n People who are, you know,\n\n1:05:31.980 --> 1:05:34.100\n they sometimes don't get the credit they deserve\n\n1:05:34.100 --> 1:05:36.540\n because they were critical both to support,\n\n1:05:36.540 --> 1:05:38.260\n like, you know, it's hard and you want,\n\n1:05:38.260 --> 1:05:40.340\n you need some support, people need support.\n\n1:05:40.340 --> 1:05:41.580\n And I needed just encouragement.\n\n1:05:41.580 --> 1:05:43.860\n And they were helping and encouraged by contributing.\n\n1:05:43.860 --> 1:05:47.260\n And once, the big thing for me was when John Hunter,\n\n1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:50.180\n he had previously done kind of a simple thing\n\n1:05:50.180 --> 1:05:52.820\n called numerics to kind of, you know, between numeric\n\n1:05:52.820 --> 1:05:55.100\n and numerae, he had a little high level tool\n\n1:05:55.100 --> 1:05:57.900\n that would just select each one for matplotlib.\n\n1:05:57.900 --> 1:06:00.420\n In 2006, he finally said,\n\n1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:03.220\n we're gonna just make numpy the dependency of matplotlib.\n\n1:06:03.220 --> 1:06:04.420\n As soon as he did that,\n\n1:06:04.420 --> 1:06:06.100\n and I remember specifically when he did that,\n\n1:06:06.100 --> 1:06:07.900\n I said, okay, we've done it.\n\n1:06:07.900 --> 1:06:11.260\n Like, that was when I knew we had to see success.\n\n1:06:11.260 --> 1:06:13.620\n Before then it was still unsure,\n\n1:06:13.620 --> 1:06:15.060\n but that kind of started a roller coaster.\n\n1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:17.900\n And then 2006 to 2009.\n\n1:06:17.900 --> 1:06:20.940\n And then I've been floored by what it's done.\n\n1:06:20.940 --> 1:06:22.900\n Like, I knew it would help.\n\n1:06:22.900 --> 1:06:25.380\n I had no idea how much it would help.\n\n1:06:25.380 --> 1:06:26.300\n Right, so.\n\n1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:28.660\n And it has to do with, again, the language thing.\n\n1:06:28.660 --> 1:06:31.940\n It just, people started to think in terms of numpy.\n\n1:06:31.940 --> 1:06:32.820\n Yes.\n\n1:06:32.820 --> 1:06:36.460\n And that opened up a whole new way of thinking.\n\n1:06:36.460 --> 1:06:39.220\n And part of the story that you kind of mentioned,\n\n1:06:39.220 --> 1:06:42.980\n but maybe you can elaborate,\n\n1:06:42.980 --> 1:06:46.320\n is it seems like at some point in the story,\n\n1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:50.800\n Python took over science and data science.\n\n1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:51.640\n Yes.\n\n1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:54.800\n And bigger than that,\n\n1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:59.800\n the scientific community started to think like programmers\n\n1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:04.280\n or started to utilize the tools of computers to do,\n\n1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:06.640\n like at a scale that wasn't done with Fortran.\n\n1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:09.320\n Like at this gigantic scale,\n\n1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:10.760\n they started to open in their heart.\n\n1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:12.040\n And then Python was the thing.\n\n1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:14.280\n I mean, there's a few other competitors, I guess,\n\n1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:16.960\n but Python, I think, really, really took over.\n\n1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:17.800\n I agree.\n\n1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:18.620\n There's a lot of stories here\n\n1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:19.720\n that are kind of during this journey,\n\n1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:23.240\n because this is sort of the start of this journey in 2005, 2006.\n\n1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:28.180\n So my tenure committee, I applied for tenure in 2006, 2007.\n\n1:07:28.180 --> 1:07:29.780\n It came back, I split the department.\n\n1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:31.300\n I was very polarizing.\n\n1:07:31.300 --> 1:07:32.560\n I had some huge fans\n\n1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:34.380\n and then some people that said no way, right?\n\n1:07:34.380 --> 1:07:36.840\n So it was very, I was a polarizing figure in the department.\n\n1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:39.800\n It went all the way up to the university president.\n\n1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:42.760\n Ultimately, my department chair had the sway\n\n1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:43.760\n and they didn't say no.\n\n1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:46.360\n They said, come back in two years and do it again.\n\n1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:49.680\n And I went, eh, at that point, I was like,\n\n1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:52.840\n I mean, I had this interest in entrepreneurship,\n\n1:07:52.840 --> 1:07:56.400\n this interest in not the academic circles,\n\n1:07:56.400 --> 1:07:59.680\n not the, like, how do we make industry work?\n\n1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:03.060\n So I do have to give credit to that exploration of economics\n\n1:08:03.060 --> 1:08:06.540\n because that led me, oh, I had a lot of opinions.\n\n1:08:06.540 --> 1:08:09.520\n I was actually very libertarian at the time.\n\n1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:11.840\n And I still have some libertarian trends,\n\n1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:15.880\n but I'm more of a, I'm more of a collectivist libertarian.\n\n1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:18.720\n So you value broadly, philosophically freedom.\n\n1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:20.360\n I value broadly, philosophically freedom,\n\n1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:23.440\n but I also understand the power of communities,\n\n1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:26.200\n like the power of collective behavior.\n\n1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:27.840\n And so what's that balance, right?\n\n1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:28.880\n That makes sense.\n\n1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:31.520\n So by the time I was just,\n\n1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:33.380\n I gotta go out and explore this entrepreneur world.\n\n1:08:33.380 --> 1:08:34.220\n So I left academia.\n\n1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:37.820\n I said, no thanks, called my friend, Eric, here,\n\n1:08:37.820 --> 1:08:39.560\n who had, his company was going.\n\n1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:43.120\n I said, hey, could I join you and start this trend?\n\n1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.920\n And he, at that time they were using SciFi a lot.\n\n1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:47.120\n They were trying to get clients.\n\n1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:48.760\n And so I came down to Texas.\n\n1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:51.160\n And in Texas is where I sort of,\n\n1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:53.440\n it's my entrepreneur world, right?\n\n1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:57.360\n I left academia and went to entrepreneur world in 2007.\n\n1:08:57.360 --> 1:08:59.920\n So I moved here in 2007, kind of took a leap,\n\n1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:01.600\n knew nothing really about business,\n\n1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:03.740\n knew nothing about a lot of stuff there.\n\n1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:06.980\n There's, you know, for a long time,\n\n1:09:06.980 --> 1:09:08.980\n I've kept some connections to a lot of academics\n\n1:09:08.980 --> 1:09:10.080\n because I still value it.\n\n1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:12.520\n I still love the scientific tradition.\n\n1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:15.240\n I still value the essence and the soul and the heart\n\n1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.320\n of what is possible.\n\n1:09:17.320 --> 1:09:21.380\n Don't like a lot of the administration\n\n1:09:21.380 --> 1:09:24.160\n and the kind of, we can go into detail about why\n\n1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:25.320\n and where and how this happens,\n\n1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:26.520\n what are some of the challenges.\n\n1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:28.480\n I don't know, but I'm with you.\n\n1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:31.840\n So I'm still affiliated with MIT.\n\n1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:35.600\n I still love MIT because there's magic there.\n\n1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:40.320\n There's people I talk to, like researchers, faculty,\n\n1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:43.120\n in those conversations and the whiteboard\n\n1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:46.220\n and just the conversation, that's magic there.\n\n1:09:46.220 --> 1:09:48.120\n All the other stuff, the administration,\n\n1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:51.020\n all that kind of stuff seems to,\n\n1:09:52.020 --> 1:09:54.920\n you don't wanna say too harshly criticize\n\n1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:57.680\n sort of bureaucracies, but there's a lag\n\n1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:00.800\n that seems to get in the way of the magic.\n\n1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:03.800\n And I'm still have a lot of hope\n\n1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:08.320\n that that can change because I don't often see\n\n1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:12.840\n that particular type of magic elsewhere in the industry.\n\n1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:15.800\n So like we need that and we need that flame going.\n\n1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:19.120\n And it's the same thing as exactly as you said,\n\n1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:20.560\n it has the same kind of elements\n\n1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:23.240\n like the open source community does.\n\n1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:27.160\n And, but then if you, like the reason I stepped away,\n\n1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:30.260\n the reason I'm here, just like you did in Austin is like,\n\n1:10:30.260 --> 1:10:33.240\n if I wanna build one robot, I'll stay at MIT.\n\n1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:37.460\n But if I wanna build millions and make money enough\n\n1:10:37.460 --> 1:10:41.000\n to where I can explore the magic of that, then you can't.\n\n1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:44.160\n And I think that dance is...\n\n1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:47.480\n That translational dance has been lost a bit, right?\n\n1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:48.640\n And there's a lot of reasons for that.\n\n1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:50.160\n I'm not, I'm certainly not an expert on this stuff.\n\n1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:51.660\n I can opine like anybody else,\n\n1:10:51.660 --> 1:10:55.820\n but I realized that I wanted to explore entrepreneurship,\n\n1:10:55.820 --> 1:10:57.720\n which I, and really figure out,\n\n1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:01.560\n and it's been a driving passion for 20 years, 25 years.\n\n1:11:01.560 --> 1:11:06.480\n How do we connect capital markets and company?\n\n1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:07.880\n Cause again, I fell in love with the notion of,\n\n1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:11.160\n oh, profit seeking on its own is not a bad thing.\n\n1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:13.520\n It's actually a coordination mechanism\n\n1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:16.480\n for allocating resources that, you know,\n\n1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:18.000\n in an emergent way, right?\n\n1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.720\n That respects everybody's opinions, right?\n\n1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:21.880\n So this is actually powerful.\n\n1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:25.320\n So I say all the time, when I make a company\n\n1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:27.260\n and we do something that makes profit,\n\n1:11:27.260 --> 1:11:28.100\n what we're saying is, hey,\n\n1:11:28.100 --> 1:11:29.800\n we're collecting of the world's resources\n\n1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:31.480\n and voluntarily people are asking us\n\n1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:33.000\n to do something that they like.\n\n1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.000\n And that's a huge deal.\n\n1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.120\n And so I really liked that energy.\n\n1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:37.560\n So that's what I came to do and to learn\n\n1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:38.480\n and to try to figure out.\n\n1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:40.120\n And that's what I've been kind of stumbling through\n\n1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:40.960\n since for the past 14 years.\n\n1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:42.580\n And that's 2007.\n\n1:11:42.580 --> 1:11:43.420\n 2007, yeah.\n\n1:11:43.420 --> 1:11:44.960\n And so you were still working at NoPi.\n\n1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:46.560\n So NoPi was just emerging.\n\n1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:47.400\n Just emerging.\n\n1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:49.160\n One of the things I've done,\n\n1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:51.480\n it's worth mentioning because it emphasizes\n\n1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:53.840\n the exploratory nature of my thinking at the time.\n\n1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:55.240\n I said, well, I don't know how to fund this thing.\n\n1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:56.720\n I've got a graduate student I'm paying for\n\n1:11:56.720 --> 1:11:57.880\n and I've got no funding for him.\n\n1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:00.520\n And I had done some fundraising from the public\n\n1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:02.800\n to try to get public fundraisers in my lab.\n\n1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:03.880\n I didn't really wanna go out\n\n1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.360\n and just do the fundraising circuit\n\n1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:06.920\n the way it's traditionally done.\n\n1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:09.960\n So I wrote a book and I said, I'm gonna write a book\n\n1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:11.440\n and I'm gonna charge for it.\n\n1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:12.720\n It was called Guide to NoPi.\n\n1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:14.040\n And so ultimately NoPi became\n\n1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:15.960\n documentation driven development\n\n1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:17.280\n because I basically wrote the book\n\n1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:19.760\n and made sure the stuff worked or the book would work.\n\n1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:23.040\n So it really helped actually make NoPi become a thing.\n\n1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:25.800\n So writing that book,\n\n1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:28.200\n and it's not a page turner.\n\n1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:29.680\n Guide to NoPi is not a book you pick up\n\n1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:31.520\n and go, oh, this is great, over the fire.\n\n1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:33.640\n But it's where you could find the details,\n\n1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:34.720\n like how'd all this work.\n\n1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:36.520\n And a lot of people love that book.\n\n1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:38.040\n And so a lot of people ended up,\n\n1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:41.600\n so I said, look, I need to, so I'm gonna charge for it.\n\n1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:42.760\n And I got some flack for that.\n\n1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:45.920\n Not that much, just probably five angry messages,\n\n1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:49.960\n people yelling at me saying I was a bad guy\n\n1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:51.360\n for charging for this book.\n\n1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:53.280\n Was one of them Richard Stallman?\n\n1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:54.120\n No. Just kidding.\n\n1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:56.920\n No, I haven't really had any interaction with him personally,\n\n1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:59.840\n like I said, but there were a few,\n\n1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:01.280\n but actually surprisingly not.\n\n1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:02.760\n There was actually a lot of people like,\n\n1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:04.240\n no, it's fine, you can charge for a book.\n\n1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:05.080\n That's no big deal.\n\n1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:07.080\n We know that's a way you can try to make money\n\n1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:07.920\n around open source.\n\n1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:10.160\n So what I did, I did it in an interesting way.\n\n1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:14.280\n I said, well, kind of my ideas around IP law and stuff.\n\n1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:16.120\n I love the idea you can share something, you can spread it.\n\n1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:18.280\n Like once it's, the fact that you have a thing\n\n1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:21.640\n and copying is free, but the creation is not free.\n\n1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:25.600\n So how do you fund the creation and allow the copying?\n\n1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:27.040\n And in software, it's a little more complicated than that\n\n1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:29.360\n because creation is actually a continuous thing.\n\n1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:31.160\n It's not like you build a widget and it's done.\n\n1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:32.640\n It's sort of a process of emerging\n\n1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:34.560\n and continuing to create.\n\n1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:35.520\n But I wrote the book\n\n1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:37.520\n and had this market determined price thing.\n\n1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:40.720\n I said, look, I need, I think I said 250,000.\n\n1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:44.280\n If I make 250,000 from this book, I'll make it free.\n\n1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:45.760\n So as soon as I get that much money,\n\n1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:48.960\n or I said five years, so there's a time limit.\n\n1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:49.800\n Like it's not forever.\n\n1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:50.640\n That's really cool.\n\n1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:51.680\n It's amazing.\n\n1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:53.080\n I released it on this.\n\n1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:54.240\n And it's actually interesting\n\n1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:55.800\n because one of the people\n\n1:13:55.800 --> 1:13:57.040\n who also thought that was interesting\n\n1:13:57.040 --> 1:13:58.600\n ended up being Chris White,\n\n1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:01.360\n who was the director of DARPA project\n\n1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:02.920\n that we got funding through at Anaconda.\n\n1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:04.640\n And the reason he even called us back\n\n1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:06.720\n is because he remembered my name from this book\n\n1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:08.080\n and he thought that was interesting.\n\n1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:10.880\n And so even though we hadn't gone to the demo days,\n\n1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:12.680\n we applied and the people said, yeah,\n\n1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:15.360\n nobody ever gets this without coming to the demo day first.\n\n1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:16.320\n This is the first time I've seen it.\n\n1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:18.200\n But it's because I knew, you know,\n\n1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:19.640\n Chris had done this and had this interaction.\n\n1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:21.680\n So it did have impact.\n\n1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:23.880\n I was actually really, really pleased by the result.\n\n1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:27.360\n I mean, I ended up in three years, I made 90,000.\n\n1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:29.480\n So sold 30,000 copies by myself.\n\n1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:33.000\n I just put it up on, you know, use PayPal and sold it.\n\n1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:36.040\n And that was my first taste of kind of, okay,\n\n1:14:36.040 --> 1:14:37.600\n this can work to some degree.\n\n1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:40.320\n And I, you know, all over the world, right?\n\n1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:44.480\n From Germany to Japan to, it was actually, it did work.\n\n1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:47.040\n And so I appreciated the fact that PayPal existed\n\n1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:51.200\n and I had a way to get the money, the distribution was simple.\n\n1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:53.480\n This is pre Amazon book stuff.\n\n1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:55.320\n So it was just publishing a website.\n\n1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:57.120\n It was the popularity of SciPy emerging\n\n1:14:57.120 --> 1:14:58.960\n and getting company usage.\n\n1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:00.600\n I ended up not letting it go the five years\n\n1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:01.960\n and not trying to make the full amount\n\n1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:04.560\n because, you know, a year and a half later,\n\n1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:05.400\n I was at Enthought.\n\n1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:06.680\n I had left academia as an Enthought\n\n1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:07.880\n and I kind of had a full time job.\n\n1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:10.000\n And then actually what happened is the documentation people,\n\n1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:10.840\n there's a group that said, hey,\n\n1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:14.280\n we want to do documentation for SciPy as a collective.\n\n1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:18.680\n And they're essentially needing the stuff in the book, right?\n\n1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:20.360\n And so they kind of ask,\n\n1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:21.920\n hey, could we just use the stuff in your book?\n\n1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:24.160\n And at that point I said, yeah, I'll just open it up.\n\n1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:27.320\n So that's, but it has served its purpose.\n\n1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:31.040\n And the money that I made actually funded my grad student.\n\n1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:32.160\n Like it was actually, you know,\n\n1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:35.440\n I paid him 25,000 a year out of that money.\n\n1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:37.440\n So the funny thing is if you do a very similar\n\n1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:40.680\n kind of experiment now with NumPy or something like it,\n\n1:15:40.680 --> 1:15:42.480\n you could probably make a lot more.\n\n1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:43.800\n It's probably true.\n\n1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:46.360\n Because of the tooling and the community building.\n\n1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:47.200\n Yeah, I agree.\n\n1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:48.680\n Like the, and social media,\n\n1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:51.560\n that there's just a virality to that kind of idea.\n\n1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:52.400\n I agree.\n\n1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:53.240\n There'd be things to do.\n\n1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:54.080\n I've thought about that.\n\n1:15:54.080 --> 1:15:56.080\n And really I thought about a couple of books\n\n1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:57.440\n or a couple of things that could be done there.\n\n1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:58.960\n And I just haven't, right?\n\n1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:01.920\n Even, I tried to hire a ghostwriter this year too\n\n1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:04.160\n to see if that could help, but it didn't.\n\n1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:06.240\n But part of my problem is this,\n\n1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:08.080\n I've been so excited by a number of things\n\n1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:09.480\n that have stemmed from that.\n\n1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:13.040\n Like, so I came here, worked at Enthought for four years,\n\n1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:14.960\n graciously, Eric made me president.\n\n1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:16.280\n Then we started to work closely together.\n\n1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:18.400\n We actually helped him buy out his partner.\n\n1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:20.720\n It didn't end great.\n\n1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.880\n Like unfortunately Eric and I aren't real,\n\n1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:24.560\n aren't friends now.\n\n1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:25.400\n I still respect him.\n\n1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:26.640\n I have a lot, I wish we were,\n\n1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:30.240\n but he didn't like the fact that Peter and I\n\n1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:31.680\n started Anaconda, right?\n\n1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:36.200\n That was not, I mean, so there's two sides to that story.\n\n1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:37.360\n So I'm not gonna go into it, right?\n\n1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:38.200\n Sure.\n\n1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:40.600\n But you, as human beings\n\n1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:42.320\n and you wish you still could be friends.\n\n1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:43.920\n I do, I do.\n\n1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:45.160\n It saddens me.\n\n1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:49.040\n I mean, that's a story of great minds\n\n1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:51.480\n building great companies.\n\n1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:55.000\n Somehow it's sad that when there's that kind of.\n\n1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.360\n And I hold him in esteem.\n\n1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:58.200\n I'm grateful for him.\n\n1:16:58.200 --> 1:17:00.320\n I think Enthought still exists.\n\n1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.520\n They're doing great work helping scientists.\n\n1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:05.040\n They still run the SciPy conference.\n\n1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:07.320\n They have an R&D platform they're selling now\n\n1:17:07.320 --> 1:17:10.080\n that's a tool that you can go get today, right?\n\n1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:14.920\n So Enthought has played a role in the SciPy\n\n1:17:14.920 --> 1:17:18.240\n in supporting the community around SciPy, I would say.\n\n1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:20.560\n They ended up not being able to,\n\n1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:22.040\n they ended up building a tool suite\n\n1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:24.040\n to write GUI applications.\n\n1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:25.440\n Like that's where they could actually make\n\n1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:26.680\n that the business could work.\n\n1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:29.480\n And so supporting SciPy and NumPy itself\n\n1:17:29.480 --> 1:17:30.560\n wasn't as possible.\n\n1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:31.960\n Like they didn't, they tried.\n\n1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:33.280\n I mean, it was not just because,\n\n1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:34.480\n it was just because of the business aspect.\n\n1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:36.840\n So, and I wanted to build a company that could do,\n\n1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:39.080\n that could get venture funding, right?\n\n1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:39.920\n Better for worse.\n\n1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:41.040\n I mean, that's a longer story.\n\n1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:42.400\n We could talk a lot about that, but.\n\n1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:44.200\n And that's where Anaconda came to be.\n\n1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:45.040\n That's where Anaconda came to be.\n\n1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:48.040\n So let me ask you, it's a little bit for fun\n\n1:17:48.040 --> 1:17:50.000\n because you built this amazing thing.\n\n1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:54.640\n And so let's talk about like an old warrior\n\n1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:56.280\n looking over old battles.\n\n1:17:57.320 --> 1:18:01.480\n You've, you know, there's a sad letter in 2012\n\n1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:04.360\n that you wrote to the NumPy mailing list\n\n1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:06.320\n announcing that you're leaving NumPy.\n\n1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:08.560\n And some of the things you've listed\n\n1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:10.720\n as some of the things you regret\n\n1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:14.440\n or not regret necessarily, but some things to think about.\n\n1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:17.640\n If you could go back and you could fix stuff about NumPy\n\n1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:20.640\n or both sort of in a personal level,\n\n1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:21.960\n but also like looking forward,\n\n1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:24.560\n what kind of things would you like to see changed?\n\n1:18:24.560 --> 1:18:25.400\n Good question.\n\n1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:26.320\n So I think there's technical questions\n\n1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:28.200\n and social questions right there.\n\n1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:33.400\n First of all, you know, I wrote NumPy as a service\n\n1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:35.000\n and I spent a lot of time doing it.\n\n1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:36.760\n And then other people came help make it happen.\n\n1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:39.840\n NumPy succeeded because the work of a lot of people, right?\n\n1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:42.240\n So it's important to understand that.\n\n1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:43.880\n I'm grateful for the opportunity,\n\n1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:45.080\n the role I had, I could play\n\n1:18:45.080 --> 1:18:47.600\n and grateful that things I did had an impact,\n\n1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:49.200\n but they only had the impact they had\n\n1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:52.200\n because the other people that came to the story.\n\n1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:53.440\n And so they were essential,\n\n1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:55.720\n but the way data types were handled,\n\n1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:59.280\n the way data types, we had array scalers, for example,\n\n1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:04.080\n that are really just a substitute for a type concept, right?\n\n1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:06.960\n So we had array scalers or actual Python objects\n\n1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:09.520\n so that there's for every, for a 32 bit float\n\n1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:13.160\n or a 16 bit float or a 16 bit integer,\n\n1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:14.720\n Python doesn't have a natural,\n\n1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:17.040\n it's just one integer, there's one float.\n\n1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:19.960\n Well, what about these lower precision types,\n\n1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:21.600\n these larger precision types?\n\n1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:23.680\n So we had them in NumPy\n\n1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:25.320\n so that you could have a collection of them,\n\n1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:28.760\n but then have an object in Python that was one of them.\n\n1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:31.440\n And there's questions about like in retrospect,\n\n1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:32.920\n I wouldn't have created those\n\n1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:34.880\n if it improved the type system.\n\n1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:38.000\n And like made the type system actually a Python type system\n\n1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.480\n as opposed to currently,\n\n1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:41.400\n it's a Python one level type system.\n\n1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:42.240\n I don't know if you know the difference\n\n1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:43.200\n between Python one, Python two,\n\n1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:44.880\n it's kind of technical, kind of depth,\n\n1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:47.320\n but Python two, one of its big things that Guido did,\n\n1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:48.160\n it was really brilliant.\n\n1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:51.640\n It was the actually Python one,\n\n1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:55.040\n all classes, new objects were one.\n\n1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:56.880\n If you as a user wrote a class,\n\n1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:59.600\n it was an instance of a single Python type\n\n1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:02.000\n called the class type, right?\n\n1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.240\n In Python two, he used a meta typing hook\n\n1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:07.960\n to actually go, oh, we can extend this\n\n1:20:07.960 --> 1:20:10.960\n and have users write classes that are new types.\n\n1:20:10.960 --> 1:20:13.320\n So he was able to have your user classes be actual types\n\n1:20:13.320 --> 1:20:16.480\n and the Python type system got a lot more rich.\n\n1:20:16.480 --> 1:20:19.160\n I barely understood that at the time that NumPy was written.\n\n1:20:19.160 --> 1:20:22.480\n And so I essentially in NumPy created a type system\n\n1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:24.400\n that was Python one era.\n\n1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:29.240\n It was every D type is an instance of the same type\n\n1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:33.160\n as opposed to having new D types be really just Python types\n\n1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:34.280\n with additional metadata.\n\n1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.440\n What's the cost of that?\n\n1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:37.200\n Is it efficiency, is it usability?\n\n1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:38.840\n It's usability primarily.\n\n1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:40.320\n The cost isn't really efficiency.\n\n1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:45.080\n It's the fact that it's clumsy to create new types.\n\n1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:45.920\n It's hard.\n\n1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:47.560\n And then one of the challenges,\n\n1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:48.400\n you wanna create new types.\n\n1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:52.600\n You wanna quaternion type or you wanna add a new posit type\n\n1:20:52.600 --> 1:20:55.080\n or you wanna, so it's hard.\n\n1:20:55.080 --> 1:20:59.200\n And now, if we had done that well,\n\n1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:00.440\n when Numba came on the scene\n\n1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:02.880\n where we could actually compile Python code,\n\n1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:05.160\n it would integrate with that type system much cleaner.\n\n1:21:05.160 --> 1:21:08.080\n And now all of a sudden you could do gradual typing\n\n1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:08.920\n more easily.\n\n1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:10.560\n You could actually have Python when you add Numba\n\n1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:13.560\n plus better typing, could actually be a,\n\n1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:16.800\n you'd smooth out a lot of rough edges.\n\n1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:18.840\n But there's already, there's like,\n\n1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:20.960\n but are you talking about from the perspective\n\n1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:23.840\n of developers within NumPy or users of NumPy?\n\n1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:27.080\n Developers of new, not really users of NumPy so much.\n\n1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:28.800\n It's the development of NumPy.\n\n1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:32.160\n So you're thinking about like how to design NumPy\n\n1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:33.880\n so that it's contributors.\n\n1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:35.880\n Yeah, the contributors, it's easier.\n\n1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:36.720\n It's easier.\n\n1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:39.320\n It's less work to make it better and to keep it maintained.\n\n1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:41.480\n And where that's impacted things, for example,\n\n1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:43.400\n is the GPU.\n\n1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:45.520\n Like all of a sudden GPUs start getting added\n\n1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:48.360\n and we don't have them in NumPy.\n\n1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:50.560\n Like NumPy should just work on GPUs.\n\n1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:52.680\n The fact that we'd have to download a whole other object\n\n1:21:52.680 --> 1:21:54.800\n called Kupy to have arrays on GPUs\n\n1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:57.440\n is just an artifact of history.\n\n1:21:57.440 --> 1:21:59.160\n Like there's no fundamental reason for it.\n\n1:21:59.160 --> 1:22:00.200\n Well, that's really interesting.\n\n1:22:00.200 --> 1:22:02.520\n If we could sort of go on that tangent briefly\n\n1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:07.520\n is you have PyTorch and other libraries like TensorFlow\n\n1:22:07.800 --> 1:22:11.840\n that basically tried to mimic NumPy.\n\n1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:15.720\n Like you've created a sort of platonic form\n\n1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:16.920\n of multi dimension. Basically, yeah.\n\n1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:17.760\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:19.800\n Well, and the problem was I didn't realize that.\n\n1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:21.760\n Platonic form has a lot of edges.\n\n1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:23.360\n They're like, well, we should cut those out\n\n1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:24.200\n before we present it.\n\n1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:26.920\n So I wonder if you can comment,\n\n1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:29.360\n is there like a difference between their implementations?\n\n1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:31.440\n Do you wish that they were all using NumPy\n\n1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:34.040\n or like in this abstraction of GPU?\n\n1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:38.240\n And sorry to interrupt that there's GPUs, ASICs.\n\n1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:40.040\n There might be other neuromorphic computing.\n\n1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:41.600\n There might be other kind of,\n\n1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:43.920\n or the aliens will come with a new kind of computer.\n\n1:22:43.920 --> 1:22:47.880\n Like an abstraction that NumPy should just operate nicely\n\n1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:50.280\n over the things that are more and more\n\n1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:54.200\n and smarter and smarter with this multi dimensional arrays.\n\n1:22:54.200 --> 1:22:55.520\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:22:55.520 --> 1:22:56.920\n There's several comments there.\n\n1:22:56.920 --> 1:23:00.360\n We are working on something now called data dash APIs.org.\n\n1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:02.560\n Data dash API.org, you can go there today.\n\n1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:04.480\n And it's our answer.\n\n1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:05.320\n It's my answer.\n\n1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:06.160\n It's not just me.\n\n1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:09.120\n It's me and Rolf and Athen and Aaron\n\n1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:12.160\n and a lot of companies are helping us at Quansight Labs.\n\n1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:14.560\n It's not unifying all the arrays.\n\n1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:17.200\n It's creating an API that is unified.\n\n1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:19.360\n So we do care about this\n\n1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:21.280\n and we're trying to work through it.\n\n1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:22.560\n I actually had the chance to go and meet\n\n1:23:22.560 --> 1:23:25.360\n with the TensorFlow team and the PyTorch team\n\n1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:29.120\n and talk to them after exiting Anaconda.\n\n1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:29.960\n Just talking about,\n\n1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:33.960\n because the first year after leaving Anaconda in 2018,\n\n1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:36.000\n I became deeply aware of this and realized that,\n\n1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.960\n oh, this split in the array community that exists today\n\n1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:43.040\n makes what I was concerned about in 2005 pretty parochial.\n\n1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:45.880\n It's a lot worse, right?\n\n1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:47.280\n Now there's a lot more people.\n\n1:23:47.280 --> 1:23:51.400\n So perhaps the industry can sustain more stacks, right?\n\n1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:52.560\n There's a lot of money,\n\n1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:54.120\n but it makes it a lot less efficient.\n\n1:23:54.120 --> 1:23:56.720\n I mean, but I've also learned to appreciate,\n\n1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:58.440\n it's okay to have some competition.\n\n1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:00.760\n It's okay to have different implementations,\n\n1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:03.560\n but it's better if you can at least refactor some parts.\n\n1:24:03.560 --> 1:24:04.960\n I mean, you're gonna be more efficient\n\n1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:07.000\n if you can refactor parts.\n\n1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:09.560\n It's nice to have competition over things,\n\n1:24:09.560 --> 1:24:11.760\n over what is nice to have competition.\n\n1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:12.600\n They're innovative.\n\n1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:13.440\n Yeah, innovative.\n\n1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:15.920\n And then maybe on the infrastructure,\n\n1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:18.120\n whatever, however you define infrastructure,\n\n1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:21.400\n that maybe it's nice to have come together.\n\n1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:22.440\n Exactly, I agree.\n\n1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:24.600\n And I think, but it was interesting to hear the stories.\n\n1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:29.040\n I mean, TensorFlow came out of a C++ library,\n\n1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:30.160\n Jeff Dean wrote, I think,\n\n1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:33.560\n that was basically how they were doing inference, right?\n\n1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:34.400\n And then they realized, oh,\n\n1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:36.440\n we could do this TensorFlow thing.\n\n1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:38.400\n That C++ library, then what was interesting to me\n\n1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:42.600\n was the fact that both Google and Facebook did not,\n\n1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:44.960\n it's not like they supported Python or NumPy initially.\n\n1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:47.200\n They just realized they had to.\n\n1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:48.760\n They came to this world and then all the users were like,\n\n1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:50.680\n hey, where's the NumPy interface?\n\n1:24:50.680 --> 1:24:52.560\n Oh, and then they kind of came late to it\n\n1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:54.800\n and then they had these bolt ons.\n\n1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:57.280\n TensorFlow's bolt on, I don't mean to offend,\n\n1:24:57.280 --> 1:24:58.480\n but it was so bad.\n\n1:24:58.480 --> 1:24:59.320\n Yeah, it was bad.\n\n1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:01.760\n It's the first time that I'm usually,\n\n1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:04.160\n I mean, one of the challenges I have\n\n1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:07.000\n is I don't criticize enough in the sense\n\n1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.960\n that I don't give people input enough, you know, if.\n\n1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:11.680\n I think it's universally agreed upon\n\n1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:13.640\n that the bolt ons on TensorFlow were.\n\n1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:17.080\n But I went to, it was a talk given at Mallorca in Spain\n\n1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:19.880\n and a great guy came and gave a talk and I said,\n\n1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:21.400\n you should never show that API again\n\n1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:23.040\n at a PyData conference.\n\n1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:24.840\n Like that was, that's terrible.\n\n1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:27.080\n Like you're taking this beautiful system we've created\n\n1:25:27.080 --> 1:25:29.440\n and like you're corrupting all these poor Python people,\n\n1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:30.840\n forcing them to write code like that\n\n1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:32.640\n or thinking they should.\n\n1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:35.640\n Fortunately, you know, they adopted Keras as their,\n\n1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:36.760\n and Keras is better.\n\n1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:40.360\n And so Keras, TensorFlow is fine, is reasonable,\n\n1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.680\n but they bolted it on.\n\n1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:43.640\n Facebook did too.\n\n1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:48.160\n Like Facebook had their own C++ library for doing inference\n\n1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:51.160\n and they also had the same reaction, they had to do this.\n\n1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:52.840\n One big difference is Facebook,\n\n1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:55.240\n maybe because of the way it's situated in part of fair,\n\n1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:56.600\n part of the research library,\n\n1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.880\n TensorFlow is definitely used and, you know,\n\n1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:00.720\n they have to make, they couldn't just open it up\n\n1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:03.160\n and let the community, you know, change what that is.\n\n1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:04.640\n Cause I guess they were worried\n\n1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:06.880\n about disrupting their operations.\n\n1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:10.720\n Facebook's been much more open to having community input\n\n1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:12.400\n on the structure itself.\n\n1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:14.240\n Whereas Google and TensorFlow,\n\n1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:16.000\n they're really eager to have community users,\n\n1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.520\n people use it and build the infrastructure,\n\n1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:18.840\n but it's much more walled.\n\n1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:21.600\n Like it's harder to become a contributor to TensorFlow.\n\n1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:24.760\n And it's also, this is very difficult question to answer\n\n1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:27.080\n and don't mean to be throwing shade at anybody,\n\n1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:30.320\n but you have to wonder, it's the Microsoft question\n\n1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:33.920\n of when you have a tool like PyTorch or TensorFlow,\n\n1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:36.320\n how much are you tending to the hackers\n\n1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:39.240\n and how much are you tending to the big corporate clients?\n\n1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:40.080\n Correct.\n\n1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:42.560\n So like the ones that,\n\n1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:44.160\n do you tend to the millions of people\n\n1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:46.440\n that are giving you almost no money,\n\n1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:48.360\n or do you tend to the few\n\n1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:50.320\n that are giving you a ton of money?\n\n1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:54.000\n I tend to stand with the people.\n\n1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:54.840\n Right.\n\n1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:57.760\n Cause I feel like if you nurture the hackers,\n\n1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:00.200\n you will make the right decisions in the longterm\n\n1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:02.000\n that will make the companies happy.\n\n1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.280\n I lean that way too.\n\n1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:04.120\n I totally agree.\n\n1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:05.680\n But then you have to find the right dance.\n\n1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:07.080\n But it's a balance.\n\n1:27:07.080 --> 1:27:08.960\n Cause you can lean to the hackers and run out of money.\n\n1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:10.240\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:11.440\n Exactly.\n\n1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:13.760\n Which has been some of the challenge I've faced\n\n1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:14.680\n in the sense that,\n\n1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:17.040\n like I would look at some of the experiments,\n\n1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:19.040\n like NumPy, the fact that we have this split\n\n1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:21.720\n is a factor of I wasn't able to collect more money\n\n1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:22.800\n towards NumPy development.\n\n1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:23.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:24.480\n Right?\n\n1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:26.480\n I mean, I didn't succeed in the early days\n\n1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:29.560\n of getting enough financial contribution to NumPy\n\n1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:31.080\n so that they could work on it.\n\n1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:31.920\n Right?\n\n1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:32.760\n I couldn't work on it full time.\n\n1:27:32.760 --> 1:27:35.640\n I had to just catch an hour here, an hour there.\n\n1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:37.880\n And I basically not liked that.\n\n1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:39.920\n Like I've wanted to be able to do something about that\n\n1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:41.440\n for a long time and try to figure out how,\n\n1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:42.960\n well, there's lots of ways.\n\n1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:44.640\n I mean, possibly one could say,\n\n1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:46.240\n we had an offer from Microsoft\n\n1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:48.240\n at early days of Anaconda.\n\n1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:51.160\n 2014, they offered to come buy us, right?\n\n1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:52.760\n The problem was the right people at Microsoft\n\n1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:53.600\n didn't offer to buy us.\n\n1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:54.880\n And they were still,\n\n1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:56.440\n they were, it was really a,\n\n1:27:56.440 --> 1:27:58.040\n we were like a second,\n\n1:27:58.040 --> 1:27:59.680\n they had really bought, they just bought R,\n\n1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:01.800\n the R company called,\n\n1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:02.800\n it was not R studio,\n\n1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:05.680\n but it was another R company that was emergent.\n\n1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:07.160\n And it was kind of a,\n\n1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:09.360\n well, we should also get a Python play,\n\n1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:11.520\n but they were really doubling down on R.\n\n1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:12.360\n Right?\n\n1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:13.200\n And so it was like,\n\n1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:14.400\n it was where you would go to die.\n\n1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:15.440\n So it's not, it wasn't,\n\n1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:17.160\n it was before Satya was there.\n\n1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:18.680\n Satya had just started.\n\n1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:19.520\n Just started.\n\n1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:20.360\n Right?\n\n1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:21.800\n And the offer was coming from someone\n\n1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:23.080\n two levels down from him.\n\n1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:23.920\n Got you.\n\n1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:24.760\n Right?\n\n1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:26.640\n And if it had come from Scott Guthrie,\n\n1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:28.320\n so I got a chance to meet Scott Guthrie,\n\n1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:29.760\n great guy, I like him.\n\n1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:31.560\n If an offer had come from him,\n\n1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:33.200\n probably would be at Microsoft right now.\n\n1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:34.520\n That'd be fascinating.\n\n1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:36.160\n That would be really nice actually,\n\n1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:38.720\n especially given what Microsoft has since done\n\n1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:40.200\n for the open source community and all those things.\n\n1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:41.640\n Yes, I think they're doing well.\n\n1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:43.720\n I really like some of the stuff they've been doing.\n\n1:28:43.720 --> 1:28:45.200\n They're still working,\n\n1:28:45.200 --> 1:28:46.040\n and they've, you know,\n\n1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:46.880\n they've hired Guido now,\n\n1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:47.720\n and they've hired a lot of Python developers.\n\n1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:49.400\n Wait, Guido's not at Microsoft?\n\n1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:50.240\n Yeah, he works at Microsoft.\n\n1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:51.080\n I need to.\n\n1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:53.600\n Which, he retired,\n\n1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:54.720\n then he came out of retirement,\n\n1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:55.560\n and he's working now.\n\n1:28:55.560 --> 1:28:56.400\n I was just talking to him,\n\n1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:57.840\n and he didn't mention this person.\n\n1:28:57.840 --> 1:28:58.680\n Well.\n\n1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:01.280\n I should investigate this further.\n\n1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:02.120\n Well.\n\n1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:02.960\n Because I know he loved Dropbox,\n\n1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:04.000\n but I wasn't sure what he was doing,\n\n1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:05.160\n who he was up to.\n\n1:29:05.160 --> 1:29:06.560\n Well, he was kind of saying he'd retire,\n\n1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:09.640\n but, and it's literally been five years\n\n1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:12.280\n since I last sat down and really talked to Guido.\n\n1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:13.640\n Right?\n\n1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:16.000\n Guido's a technology expert, right?\n\n1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:17.480\n He's a, so I came,\n\n1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:18.880\n I was excited because I'd finally figured out\n\n1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:20.720\n the type system for NumPy.\n\n1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:22.240\n I wanted to kind of talk about that with him,\n\n1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:23.960\n and I kind of overwhelmed him.\n\n1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:25.080\n Could you stay in that,\n\n1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:26.640\n just for a brief moment,\n\n1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:28.200\n because you're a fascinating person\n\n1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:29.440\n in the history of programming.\n\n1:29:29.440 --> 1:29:31.240\n He is a fascinating person.\n\n1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:34.200\n What have you learned from Guido\n\n1:29:34.200 --> 1:29:37.560\n about programming, about life?\n\n1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:38.400\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:39.240\n A lot, actually.\n\n1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.840\n I've been a fan of Guido's.\n\n1:29:40.840 --> 1:29:42.520\n You know, we have a chance to talk.\n\n1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:43.760\n Some, I wouldn't say, you know,\n\n1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:44.840\n we talk all the time.\n\n1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:45.680\n Not at all.\n\n1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:47.520\n He may, but we talk enough to,\n\n1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:48.840\n I respect his,\n\n1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:49.880\n in fact, when I first started NumPy,\n\n1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:51.520\n one of the first things I did was I had a,\n\n1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:53.320\n I asked Guido for a meeting\n\n1:29:53.320 --> 1:29:55.400\n with him and Paul Dubois in San Mateo.\n\n1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:56.920\n And I went and met him for lunch.\n\n1:29:56.920 --> 1:29:58.000\n And basically, to say,\n\n1:29:58.000 --> 1:29:59.200\n maybe we can actually,\n\n1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:00.720\n part of the strategy for NumPy\n\n1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:02.440\n was to get it into Python 3,\n\n1:30:02.440 --> 1:30:04.120\n and maybe be part of Python.\n\n1:30:04.120 --> 1:30:05.160\n And so we talked about that.\n\n1:30:05.160 --> 1:30:06.000\n That's a cool conversation.\n\n1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:06.920\n And about that approach, right?\n\n1:30:06.920 --> 1:30:09.200\n I would have loved to be a flyer in the water.\n\n1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:10.040\n That was good.\n\n1:30:10.040 --> 1:30:12.080\n And over the years for Guido,\n\n1:30:12.080 --> 1:30:13.560\n I learned,\n\n1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:14.840\n so he was open.\n\n1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:18.200\n Like, he was willing to listen to people's ideas.\n\n1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:19.040\n Right?\n\n1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:19.880\n And over the years,\n\n1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:20.920\n now generally, you know,\n\n1:30:20.920 --> 1:30:22.600\n I'm not saying universally that's been true,\n\n1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:24.360\n but generally that's been true.\n\n1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:25.680\n So he's willing to listen.\n\n1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:27.240\n He's willing to defer.\n\n1:30:27.240 --> 1:30:28.280\n Like on the scientific side,\n\n1:30:28.280 --> 1:30:29.120\n he would just kind of defer.\n\n1:30:29.120 --> 1:30:30.160\n He didn't really always understand\n\n1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:31.000\n what we were doing.\n\n1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:31.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:32.800\n And he'd defer.\n\n1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:35.640\n One place where he didn't enough\n\n1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:37.680\n was we missed a matrix multiply operator.\n\n1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:39.600\n Like that finally got added to Python,\n\n1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:42.240\n but about 10 years later than it should have.\n\n1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:44.760\n But the reason was because nobody,\n\n1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:46.200\n it takes a lot of effort.\n\n1:30:46.200 --> 1:30:48.160\n And I learned this while I was writing NumPy.\n\n1:30:48.160 --> 1:30:49.320\n I also wrote tools to Python.\n\n1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:50.160\n I began with Python Dev,\n\n1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:52.320\n and I added some pieces to Python.\n\n1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:53.400\n Like the memory view object.\n\n1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:55.680\n I wanted the structure of NumPy into Python.\n\n1:30:55.680 --> 1:30:56.960\n So we didn't get NumPy into Python,\n\n1:30:56.960 --> 1:30:59.480\n but we got the basic structure of it into Python.\n\n1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:01.000\n Like, so you could build on it.\n\n1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:01.880\n Nobody did for a while,\n\n1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:04.720\n but eventually database authors started to.\n\n1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:05.760\n And it's a lot better.\n\n1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:06.600\n They did.\n\n1:31:06.600 --> 1:31:08.960\n And also Antoine Petrou and Stefan Krah\n\n1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:10.760\n actually fixed the memory view object.\n\n1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:13.280\n Cause I wrote the underlying infrastructure in C,\n\n1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:15.520\n but the Python exposure was terrible\n\n1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:16.640\n until they came in and fixed it.\n\n1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:18.080\n Partly because I was writing NumPy,\n\n1:31:18.080 --> 1:31:19.960\n and NumPy was the Python exposure.\n\n1:31:19.960 --> 1:31:21.240\n I didn't really care about\n\n1:31:21.240 --> 1:31:22.800\n if you didn't have NumPy installed.\n\n1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:25.360\n Anyway, Guido opened up ideas,\n\n1:31:25.360 --> 1:31:27.280\n technologically brilliant.\n\n1:31:27.280 --> 1:31:29.440\n Like really, I really got a lot of respect for him\n\n1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:30.360\n when I saw what he did\n\n1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:33.320\n with this type class merger thing.\n\n1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:35.200\n It was actually tricky, right?\n\n1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:38.400\n And then willing to share, willing to share his ideas.\n\n1:31:38.400 --> 1:31:40.200\n So the other thing early on in 1998,\n\n1:31:40.200 --> 1:31:42.240\n I said, I wrote my first extension module.\n\n1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:44.800\n The reason I could is because he'd written this blog post\n\n1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:47.360\n on how to do reference counting, right?\n\n1:31:47.360 --> 1:31:50.040\n And without it, I would have been lost, right?\n\n1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:53.240\n But he was willing to at least try to write this post.\n\n1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:56.080\n And so he's been motivated early on with Python.\n\n1:31:56.080 --> 1:31:58.200\n There's a computer science for everybody.\n\n1:31:58.200 --> 1:31:59.880\n You kind of have this early on desire to,\n\n1:31:59.880 --> 1:32:02.040\n oh, maybe we should be pushing programming to more people.\n\n1:32:02.040 --> 1:32:04.560\n So he had this populist notion, I guess,\n\n1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:08.720\n or populist sense to learn that there's a certain skill,\n\n1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:10.560\n and I've seen it in other people too,\n\n1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:13.960\n of engaging with contributors sufficiently to,\n\n1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:15.640\n because when somebody engaged with you\n\n1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:16.480\n and wants to contribute to you,\n\n1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:18.400\n if you ignore them, they go away.\n\n1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:19.760\n So building that early contributor base\n\n1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:23.320\n requires real engagement with other people.\n\n1:32:23.320 --> 1:32:24.520\n And he would do that.\n\n1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:29.080\n Can you also comment on this tragic stepping down\n\n1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:32.880\n from his position as the benevolent dictator for life\n\n1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:35.640\n over the wars, you know?\n\n1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:36.560\n The Walrus operator?\n\n1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:39.200\n The Walrus operator was the last battle.\n\n1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:40.880\n I don't know if that's the cause of it,\n\n1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:43.640\n but there's this, for people who don't know,\n\n1:32:43.640 --> 1:32:45.640\n you can look up, there's the Walrus operator,\n\n1:32:45.640 --> 1:32:49.560\n which looks like a colon and equal sign.\n\n1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:50.800\n Yeah, colon, equal sign.\n\n1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:54.680\n And it actually does maybe the thing\n\n1:32:54.680 --> 1:32:57.560\n that an equal sign should be doing.\n\n1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:00.240\n Yeah, maybe, right, exactly.\n\n1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:02.080\n But it's just historically,\n\n1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:03.560\n equal sign means something else.\n\n1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:05.240\n It just means assignment.\n\n1:33:05.240 --> 1:33:07.280\n So he stepped down over this.\n\n1:33:07.280 --> 1:33:10.360\n What do you think about the pressure of leadership?\n\n1:33:10.360 --> 1:33:12.280\n It's something that, you mentioned the letter I wrote\n\n1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:13.640\n in NumPy at the time.\n\n1:33:13.640 --> 1:33:15.240\n That was a hard time, actually.\n\n1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:17.080\n I mean, there's been really hard times.\n\n1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:17.920\n It was hard.\n\n1:33:19.520 --> 1:33:20.840\n You get criticized, right?\n\n1:33:20.840 --> 1:33:22.800\n And you get pushed, and you get,\n\n1:33:22.800 --> 1:33:23.800\n not everybody loves what you do.\n\n1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:26.880\n Like anytime you do anything that has impact at all,\n\n1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:28.560\n you're not universally loved, right?\n\n1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:29.760\n You get some real critics.\n\n1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:31.960\n And that's an important energy,\n\n1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:35.080\n because it's impossible for you to do everything right.\n\n1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:37.160\n You need people to be pushing.\n\n1:33:37.160 --> 1:33:39.320\n But sometimes people can get mean, right?\n\n1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:43.080\n People can, I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt.\n\n1:33:43.080 --> 1:33:45.800\n I don't immediately assume they have bad intentions.\n\n1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:49.000\n And maybe for other, maybe that doesn't happen for everybody.\n\n1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:50.200\n For whatever reason, their past,\n\n1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:53.040\n their experiences with people, they sometimes have bad,\n\n1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:54.880\n so they immediately attribute to you bad intentions.\n\n1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:56.080\n So you're like, where did this come from?\n\n1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:57.760\n I mean, I'm definitely open to criticism,\n\n1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:00.520\n but I think you're misinterpreting the whole point.\n\n1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:03.560\n Because I would get that, certainly when I started Anaconda.\n\n1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:07.120\n Sometimes I say to people,\n\n1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:09.760\n I care enough about entrepreneurship\n\n1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:12.240\n to make some open source people uncomfortable.\n\n1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:13.520\n And I care enough about open source\n\n1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:15.560\n to make investors uncomfortable.\n\n1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:19.880\n So I sort of, you create kind of doubters on both sides.\n\n1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:23.840\n So when you have, and this is just a plea\n\n1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:27.680\n to the listener and the public, I've noticed this too,\n\n1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:31.800\n that there's a tendency, and social media makes this worse,\n\n1:34:32.680 --> 1:34:35.560\n when you don't have perfect information about the situation,\n\n1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:39.280\n you tend to fill the gaps with the worst possible,\n\n1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:43.080\n or at least a bad story that fills those gaps.\n\n1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:46.960\n And I think it's good to live life,\n\n1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:49.760\n maybe not fully naively, but filling in the gaps\n\n1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:54.720\n with the good, with the best, with the positive,\n\n1:34:54.720 --> 1:34:57.280\n with the hopeful explanation of why you see this.\n\n1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:00.280\n So if you see somebody like you trying to make money\n\n1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:01.960\n on a book about an umpire,\n\n1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:04.880\n there's a million stories around that that are positive.\n\n1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:07.840\n And those are good to think about,\n\n1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:10.600\n to project positive intent on the people.\n\n1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:13.960\n Because for many reasons, usually because people are good\n\n1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:15.560\n and they do have good intent.\n\n1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:17.480\n And also when you project that positive intent,\n\n1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:19.400\n people will step up to that too.\n\n1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:20.240\n Yes.\n\n1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:21.760\n It's a great point.\n\n1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:24.320\n It has this kind of viral nature to it.\n\n1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:27.720\n And of course with Twitter, early on figured out,\n\n1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:30.360\n and Facebook is that they can make a lot of money\n\n1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:32.280\n and engagement from the negative.\n\n1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:33.120\n Yes.\n\n1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:35.440\n So there's this, we're fighting this mechanism.\n\n1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:36.280\n I agree.\n\n1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:37.120\n Which is challenging.\n\n1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:37.940\n It's easier.\n\n1:35:37.940 --> 1:35:38.780\n It's just easier to be.\n\n1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:39.620\n To be negative.\n\n1:35:39.620 --> 1:35:41.920\n And then for some reason, something in our minds\n\n1:35:41.920 --> 1:35:45.280\n really enjoys sharing that and getting all excited\n\n1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:46.280\n about the negativity.\n\n1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:47.400\n We do, yeah.\n\n1:35:47.400 --> 1:35:50.440\n Some protective mechanism perhaps that we're gonna get eaten\n\n1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:51.280\n if we don't, yeah.\n\n1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:52.100\n Exactly.\n\n1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:53.200\n For us to be effective as a group of people\n\n1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:54.600\n in a software engineering project,\n\n1:35:54.600 --> 1:35:56.860\n you have to project positive intent, I think.\n\n1:35:56.860 --> 1:35:57.820\n I totally agree.\n\n1:35:57.820 --> 1:35:58.660\n Totally agree.\n\n1:35:58.660 --> 1:35:59.480\n And I think that's very,\n\n1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:01.640\n and so that happens in this space.\n\n1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:03.840\n But Python has done a reasonable job in the past,\n\n1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:05.920\n but here is a situation where I think it started\n\n1:36:05.920 --> 1:36:07.840\n to get this pressure where it didn't.\n\n1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:10.440\n I really didn't, I didn't know enough about what happened.\n\n1:36:10.440 --> 1:36:12.160\n I've talked to several people about it.\n\n1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:15.840\n And I know most of the steering committee members today,\n\n1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:17.880\n one person nominated me for that role,\n\n1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:20.880\n but it's the wrong role for me right now, right?\n\n1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:24.040\n I have a lot of respect for the Python developer space\n\n1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:25.440\n and the Python developers.\n\n1:36:25.440 --> 1:36:27.600\n I also understand the gap between computer science\n\n1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:30.440\n Python developers and array programming developers\n\n1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:31.440\n or science developers.\n\n1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:34.560\n And in fact, Python succeeds in the array space\n\n1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:36.520\n the more it has people in that boundary.\n\n1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:37.960\n And there's often very few.\n\n1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:39.440\n Like I was playing a role in that boundary\n\n1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:42.600\n and working like everything to try to keep up\n\n1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.600\n with even what Guido was saying, like I'm a C programmer,\n\n1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:49.080\n but not a computer scientist.\n\n1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:52.600\n Like I was an engineer and physicist and mathematician,\n\n1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:54.840\n and I didn't always understand\n\n1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:56.360\n what they were talking about\n\n1:36:56.360 --> 1:36:58.360\n and why they would have opinions the way they did.\n\n1:36:58.360 --> 1:37:00.280\n So, you know, you have to listen and try to understand.\n\n1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:02.120\n Then you also have to explain your point of view\n\n1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:03.560\n in a way they can understand.\n\n1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:04.840\n And that takes a lot of work.\n\n1:37:04.840 --> 1:37:07.920\n And that communication is always the challenge.\n\n1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:09.200\n And it's just what we're describing here\n\n1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:11.520\n about the negativity is just another form of that.\n\n1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:12.560\n Like how do we come together?\n\n1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:14.520\n And it does appear we're wired anyway\n\n1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:16.560\n to at least have a, there's a part of us\n\n1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:18.880\n that will enemy, you know, friend, enemy.\n\n1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:21.360\n And we see, yeah, it's like,\n\n1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:23.520\n why are we wiring on the enemy front?\n\n1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:24.760\n So why are we pushing that?\n\n1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:26.680\n Why are we promoting that so deeply?\n\n1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:28.440\n Assume friend until proven otherwise.\n\n1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:30.000\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.160\n So, cause you have such a fascinating mind in all of this.\n\n1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:34.160\n Let me just ask you these questions.\n\n1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:38.000\n So one interesting side on the Python history\n\n1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.000\n is the move from Python two to Python three.\n\n1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.720\n You mentioned move from Python one to Python two,\n\n1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:46.800\n but the move from Python two to Python three\n\n1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:47.920\n is a little bit interesting\n\n1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:50.040\n because it took a very long time.\n\n1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:53.520\n It broke, you know, quite a small way\n\n1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:56.280\n backward compatibility, but even that small way\n\n1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:58.680\n seemed to have been very painful for people.\n\n1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:00.640\n Is there lessons you draw?\n\n1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:01.480\n Oh man, tons of lessons.\n\n1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:05.520\n From how long it took and how painful it seemed to be?\n\n1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:07.000\n Yeah, tons of lessons.\n\n1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.240\n Well, I mentioned here earlier\n\n1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:11.840\n that NumPy was written in 2005.\n\n1:38:11.840 --> 1:38:15.520\n It was in 2005 that I actually went to Guido\n\n1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:17.240\n to talk about getting NumPy into Python three.\n\n1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:18.880\n Like my strategy was to,\n\n1:38:18.880 --> 1:38:19.960\n oh, we were moving to Python three.\n\n1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:22.200\n Let's have that be, and it seems funny in retrospect\n\n1:38:22.200 --> 1:38:23.360\n because like, wait, Python three,\n\n1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:25.480\n that was in 2020, right?\n\n1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:27.760\n When we finally ended the support for Python two\n\n1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:29.000\n or at least 2017.\n\n1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.880\n The reason it took a long time,\n\n1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:33.320\n a lot of time, I think it was because one of the things is\n\n1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:36.240\n there wasn't much to like about Python three.\n\n1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:40.280\n 3.0, 3.1, it really wasn't until 3.3.\n\n1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:43.600\n Like I consider Python 3.3 to be Python 3.0.\n\n1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:44.880\n But it wasn't until Python 3.3\n\n1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:47.200\n that I felt there's enough stuff in it\n\n1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:49.800\n to make it worth anybody using it, right?\n\n1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:52.600\n And then 3.4 started to be, oh yeah, I want that.\n\n1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:54.880\n And then 3.5 as the matrix multiply operator,\n\n1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:56.520\n and now it's like, okay, we gotta use that.\n\n1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:58.400\n Plus the libraries that started leveraging\n\n1:38:58.400 --> 1:38:59.600\n some of the features of Python three.\n\n1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:00.760\n Exactly.\n\n1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:03.800\n So it really, the challenge was it was,\n\n1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:07.400\n but it also illustrated a truism that, you know,\n\n1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:08.240\n when you have inertia,\n\n1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:10.480\n when you have a group of people using something,\n\n1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:11.960\n it's really hard to move them away from it.\n\n1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:13.920\n You can't just change the world on them.\n\n1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:15.440\n And Python three, you know, made some,\n\n1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:17.240\n I think it fixed some things Guido had always hated.\n\n1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:18.440\n I don't think he didn't like the fact\n\n1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:19.440\n that print was a statement.\n\n1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:20.760\n He wanted to make it a function.\n\n1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:23.200\n But in some sense, that's a bit of gratuitous change\n\n1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:24.120\n to the language.\n\n1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.320\n And you could argue, and people have,\n\n1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:31.520\n but one of the challenges was there wasn't enough features\n\n1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:34.960\n and too many just changes without features.\n\n1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:37.440\n And so the empathy for the end user\n\n1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:40.480\n as to why they would switch wasn't there.\n\n1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:42.960\n I think also it illustrated just the funding realities.\n\n1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:45.040\n Like Python wasn't funded.\n\n1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:46.160\n Like it was also a project\n\n1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:48.280\n with a bunch of volunteer labor, right?\n\n1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:50.240\n It had more people, so more volunteer labor,\n\n1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:52.240\n but it was still, it was fun in the sense\n\n1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:53.480\n that at least Guido had a job.\n\n1:39:53.480 --> 1:39:55.880\n And I've learned some of the behind the scenes on that now\n\n1:39:55.880 --> 1:39:57.840\n since talking to people who have lived through it\n\n1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:00.560\n and maybe not on air, we can talk about some of that.\n\n1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:03.640\n But it's interesting to see, but Guido had a job,\n\n1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:07.080\n but his full time job wasn't just work on Python.\n\n1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:08.880\n Like he had other things to do.\n\n1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:09.880\n Just wild.\n\n1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:10.720\n It is wild, isn't it?\n\n1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:13.320\n It's wild how few people are funded.\n\n1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:14.160\n Yes.\n\n1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:15.200\n And how much impact they have.\n\n1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:16.160\n Yes.\n\n1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:17.920\n Maybe that's a feature not a bug, I don't know.\n\n1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:19.080\n Maybe, yes, exactly.\n\n1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:21.840\n At least early on, like it's sort of, I know, yeah.\n\n1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:25.160\n It's like Olympic athletes are often severely underfunded,\n\n1:40:25.160 --> 1:40:27.360\n but maybe that's what brings out the greatness.\n\n1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:28.520\n Perhaps, yes, correct.\n\n1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:29.680\n No, exactly.\n\n1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:31.880\n Maybe this is the essential part of it.\n\n1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:33.680\n Because I do think about that in terms of,\n\n1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:36.200\n I currently have an incubator for open source startups.\n\n1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:37.640\n Like what I'm trying to do right now\n\n1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:40.480\n is create the environment I wished had existed\n\n1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:42.880\n when I was leaving academia with NumPy\n\n1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:44.120\n and trying to figure out what to do.\n\n1:40:44.120 --> 1:40:46.120\n I'm trying to create those opportunities and environments.\n\n1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:49.320\n So, and that's what drives me still,\n\n1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:50.760\n is how do I make the world easier\n\n1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:52.600\n for the open source entrepreneur?\n\n1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:55.960\n So let me stay, I mean, I could probably stay on NumPy\n\n1:40:55.960 --> 1:41:00.960\n for a long time, but this is fun question.\n\n1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:04.680\n So Andre Kapathy leads the Tesla Autopilot team,\n\n1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:09.680\n and he's also one of the most like legit programmers I know.\n\n1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:13.760\n It's like he builds stuff from scratch a lot,\n\n1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:16.200\n and that's how he builds intuition about how a problem works.\n\n1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:18.320\n He just builds it from scratch, and I always love that.\n\n1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:21.320\n And the primary language he uses is Python\n\n1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:23.080\n for the intuition building.\n\n1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:27.600\n But he posted something on Twitter saying\n\n1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:31.280\n that they got a significant improvement\n\n1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:35.640\n on some aspect of their like data loading, I think,\n\n1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:39.840\n by switching away from np.square root,\n\n1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:42.160\n so the NumPy's implementation of square root,\n\n1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:44.520\n to math.square root, and then somebody else commented\n\n1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:48.120\n that you can get even a much greater improvement\n\n1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:52.600\n by using the vanilla Python square root, which is like.\n\n1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:53.640\n Power 0.5.\n\n1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:55.200\n Power 0.5.\n\n1:41:55.200 --> 1:41:57.520\n And it's fascinating to me, I just wanted to.\n\n1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:02.080\n So that was some shade throwing at some.\n\n1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:04.640\n No, no, and yes, we're talking about.\n\n1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:08.080\n It's a good way to ask the trade off\n\n1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:12.080\n between usability and efficiency broadly in NumPy,\n\n1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:14.920\n but also on these specific weird quirks\n\n1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:16.680\n of like a single function.\n\n1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:21.360\n Yep, so on that point, if you use a NumPy math function\n\n1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:25.000\n on a scaler, it's gonna be slower\n\n1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.960\n than using a Python function on that scaler.\n\n1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:32.960\n But because the math object in NumPy is more complicated,\n\n1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:36.760\n because you can also call that math object on an array.\n\n1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:39.200\n And so effectively, it goes through a similar machine.\n\n1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:41.840\n There aren't enough of the, which you would do\n\n1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:45.960\n and you could do like checks and fast paths.\n\n1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:48.800\n So yeah, if you're basically doing a list,\n\n1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:50.680\n if you run over a list, in fact,\n\n1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:53.700\n for problems that are less than 1,000,\n\n1:42:53.700 --> 1:42:55.320\n even maybe 10,000 is probably the,\n\n1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:56.900\n if you're going more than 10,000,\n\n1:42:56.900 --> 1:42:59.080\n that's where you definitely need to be using arrays.\n\n1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:01.200\n But if you're less than that, and for reading,\n\n1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:02.760\n if you're doing a reading process\n\n1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:05.600\n and essentially it's not compute bound, it's IO bound.\n\n1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:08.480\n And so you're really taking lists of 1,000 at a time\n\n1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:09.540\n and doing work on it.\n\n1:43:09.540 --> 1:43:11.680\n Yeah, you could be faster just using Python,\n\n1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:12.740\n straight up Python.\n\n1:43:12.740 --> 1:43:16.640\n See, but also, and this is the side to the top,\n\n1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:18.680\n there's the fundamental questions\n\n1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:21.240\n when you look at the long arc of history,\n\n1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:25.560\n it's very possible that np.square root is much faster.\n\n1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:26.400\n It could be.\n\n1:43:26.400 --> 1:43:29.480\n So like in terms of like, don't worry about it,\n\n1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:32.420\n it's the evils of over optimization or whatever,\n\n1:43:32.420 --> 1:43:34.040\n all the different quotes around that,\n\n1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:39.040\n is sometimes obsessing about this particular little quark\n\n1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:41.720\n is not sufficient.\n\n1:43:41.720 --> 1:43:45.220\n For somebody like, if you're trying to optimize your path,\n\n1:43:45.220 --> 1:43:47.680\n I mean, I agree, premature optimization\n\n1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:49.320\n creates all kinds of challenges, right?\n\n1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:51.840\n Because now, but you may have to do it.\n\n1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:53.880\n I believe the quote is, it's the root of all evil.\n\n1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:55.560\n It's the root of all evil, right?\n\n1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:57.040\n Let's give Donald Knuth, I think,\n\n1:43:57.040 --> 1:43:59.160\n or is he more than somebody else?\n\n1:43:59.160 --> 1:44:00.800\n Well, Doc Knuth is kind of like Mark Twain,\n\n1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:02.880\n people just attribute stuff to him, I don't know.\n\n1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:04.640\n And it's fine because he's brilliant.\n\n1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:07.640\n So, no, I was a LaTeX user myself,\n\n1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:09.280\n and so I have a lot of respect,\n\n1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:10.820\n and he did more than that, of course,\n\n1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:14.120\n but yeah, someone I really appreciate\n\n1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:15.640\n in the computer science space.\n\n1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:17.080\n Yeah, I don't, I think that's appropriate.\n\n1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:18.320\n There's a lot of little things like that,\n\n1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:20.120\n where people actually, if you understood it,\n\n1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:22.640\n you go, yeah, of course, that's the case.\n\n1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:25.040\n And the other part, the other part I didn't mention,\n\n1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:27.960\n and Numba was a thing we wrote early on,\n\n1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:29.040\n and I was really excited by Numba\n\n1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:30.040\n because it's something we wanted,\n\n1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:32.160\n it was a compiler for Python syntax,\n\n1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:35.440\n and I wanted it from the beginning of writing NumPy\n\n1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:38.280\n because of this function question,\n\n1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:41.900\n like taking, the power of arrays\n\n1:44:41.900 --> 1:44:45.120\n is really that you can write functions using all of it.\n\n1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:47.000\n It has implicit looping, right?\n\n1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:47.840\n So you don't worry about,\n\n1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:49.200\n I write this n dimensional for loop\n\n1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:51.240\n with four loops, four, four statements.\n\n1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:53.600\n You just say, oh, big four dimensional array,\n\n1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:55.760\n I'm gonna do this operation, this plus, this minus,\n\n1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:57.680\n this reduction, and you get this,\n\n1:44:57.680 --> 1:44:59.560\n it's called vectorization in other areas,\n\n1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:01.440\n but you can basically think at a high level\n\n1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:03.640\n and get massive amounts of computation done\n\n1:45:03.640 --> 1:45:06.200\n with the added benefit of,\n\n1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:08.040\n oh, it can be paralyzed easily.\n\n1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:09.040\n It can be put in parallel.\n\n1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:10.000\n You don't have to think about that.\n\n1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.720\n In fact, it's worse to go decompose your,\n\n1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:14.160\n you write the for loops\n\n1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:16.280\n and then try to infer parallelism from for loops.\n\n1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:17.600\n That's actually a harder problem\n\n1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:19.640\n than to take the array problem\n\n1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:22.040\n and just automatically parallelize that problem.\n\n1:45:22.040 --> 1:45:25.320\n That's what, and so functions in NumPy\n\n1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:27.080\n are called universal functions, ufuncs.\n\n1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:29.000\n So square root is an example of a ufunk.\n\n1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:32.400\n There are others, sine, cosine, add, subtract.\n\n1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:34.520\n In fact, one of the first libraries to SciPy\n\n1:45:34.520 --> 1:45:35.520\n was something called Special\n\n1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:36.920\n where I added Bessel functions\n\n1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:40.240\n and all these special functions that come up in physics\n\n1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:43.040\n and I added them as ufuncs so they could work on arrays.\n\n1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:44.720\n So I understood ufuncs very, very well\n\n1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:45.960\n from day one inside of numeric.\n\n1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:47.320\n That was one of the things we tried to make better\n\n1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:49.120\n in NumPy was how do they work?\n\n1:45:49.120 --> 1:45:50.360\n Can they do broadcasting?\n\n1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:51.960\n What does broadcasting mean?\n\n1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:54.600\n But one of the problems is, okay,\n\n1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:57.320\n what do I do with a Python scaler?\n\n1:45:57.320 --> 1:45:59.800\n So what happens, the Python scaler gets broadcast\n\n1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:01.320\n to a zero dimensional array\n\n1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:02.800\n and then it goes through the whole same machinery\n\n1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:05.080\n as if it were a 10,000 dimensional array.\n\n1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:07.640\n And then it kind of unpacks the element\n\n1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:08.920\n and then does the addition.\n\n1:46:09.880 --> 1:46:12.600\n That's not to mention the function it calls\n\n1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:13.640\n in the case of square root\n\n1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:15.960\n is just the clib square root, right?\n\n1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:18.160\n In some cases, like Python's power,\n\n1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:20.360\n there's some optimizations they're doing\n\n1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:21.520\n that could be faster\n\n1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:23.760\n than just calling this the clib square root.\n\n1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:25.320\n In the interpreter or in the?\n\n1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:27.640\n No, in the C code, in the Python runtime.\n\n1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:30.960\n In the Python runtime, so they really optimize it\n\n1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:32.120\n and they have the freedom to do that\n\n1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:32.960\n because they don't have to worry about.\n\n1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:34.080\n It's just a scaler.\n\n1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:34.920\n It's just a scaler.\n\n1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:36.200\n Right, they don't have to worry about the fact\n\n1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:39.360\n that, oh, this could be an object with many pieces.\n\n1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:41.080\n The ufunc machine is also generic\n\n1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:44.600\n in sense that typecasting and broadcasting,\n\n1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:46.160\n broadcasting's idea of I'm gonna go,\n\n1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:47.360\n I have a zero dimensional array,\n\n1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:49.240\n I have a scaler with a four dimensional array\n\n1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:50.480\n and I add them.\n\n1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:54.640\n Oh, I have to kind of coerce the shape of this guy\n\n1:46:54.640 --> 1:46:56.880\n to make it work against the whole four dimensional array.\n\n1:46:56.880 --> 1:46:59.680\n So it's the idea of I can do a one dimensional array\n\n1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:02.200\n against a two dimensional array and have it make sense.\n\n1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:04.040\n Well, that's what NumPy does is it challenges you\n\n1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:07.040\n to reformulate, rethink your problem\n\n1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:09.080\n as a multi dimensional array problem\n\n1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:12.640\n versus move away from scalers completely.\n\n1:47:12.640 --> 1:47:14.240\n Right, exactly, exactly.\n\n1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:16.680\n In fact, that's where some of the edge cases boundaries are\n\n1:47:16.680 --> 1:47:18.960\n is that, well, they're still there\n\n1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:21.080\n and this is where array scalers are particular.\n\n1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:23.120\n So array scalers are particularly bad\n\n1:47:23.120 --> 1:47:24.360\n in the sense that they were written\n\n1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:26.840\n so that you could optimize the math on them,\n\n1:47:26.840 --> 1:47:29.040\n but that hasn't happened.\n\n1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:32.800\n And so their default is to coerce the array scaler\n\n1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:33.760\n to a zero dimensional array\n\n1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:36.000\n and then use the NumPy machinery.\n\n1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.200\n That's what, and you could specialize,\n\n1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:39.960\n but it doesn't happen all the time.\n\n1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:41.760\n So in fact, when we first wrote Numba,\n\n1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:44.740\n we do comparisons and say, look, it's 1000X speed up.\n\n1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:47.160\n We were lying a little bit in the sense that,\n\n1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:50.240\n well, first do the 40X slowdown\n\n1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:52.280\n of using the array scalers inside of a loop.\n\n1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:53.560\n Cause if you used to use Python scalers,\n\n1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:56.200\n you'd already be 10 times faster.\n\n1:47:56.200 --> 1:47:58.080\n But then we would get a hundred times faster\n\n1:47:58.080 --> 1:48:00.320\n over that using just compilation.\n\n1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:01.600\n But what we do is compile the loop\n\n1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:04.000\n from out of the interpreter to machine code.\n\n1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.280\n And then that's always been the power of Python\n\n1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:08.280\n is this extensibility so that you can,\n\n1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:09.680\n cause people say, oh, Python's so slow.\n\n1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:11.520\n Well, sure, if you do all your logic\n\n1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:13.920\n in the runtime of the Python interpreter, yeah.\n\n1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:15.800\n But the power is that you don't have to.\n\n1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:17.260\n You write all the logic,\n\n1:48:17.260 --> 1:48:19.860\n what you do in the high level is just high level logic.\n\n1:48:19.860 --> 1:48:21.920\n And the actual calls you're making\n\n1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:24.400\n could be on gigabyte arrays of data.\n\n1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:26.880\n And that's all done at compiled speeds.\n\n1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:30.320\n And the fact that integration is one can happen,\n\n1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:32.420\n but two is separable.\n\n1:48:32.420 --> 1:48:35.240\n That's one of the, the language like Julia says,\n\n1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:36.380\n we're going to be all in one.\n\n1:48:36.380 --> 1:48:37.400\n You can do all of it together.\n\n1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:39.880\n And then there's, the jury's out, is that possible?\n\n1:48:39.880 --> 1:48:41.760\n I tend to think that you're going to,\n\n1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:43.280\n there's separate concerns there.\n\n1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:44.320\n You want to precompile.\n\n1:48:44.320 --> 1:48:47.560\n In fact, generally you will want to precompile your,\n\n1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:48.400\n some of your loops.\n\n1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:50.160\n Like SciPy is a compilation step.\n\n1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:53.240\n To install SciPy, it takes about two hours.\n\n1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:54.080\n If you have many machines,\n\n1:48:54.080 --> 1:48:55.440\n maybe you can get it down to one hour.\n\n1:48:55.440 --> 1:48:57.920\n But to compile those libraries takes about, takes a while.\n\n1:48:57.920 --> 1:48:59.920\n You don't want to do that at runtime.\n\n1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:00.800\n You don't want to do that all the time.\n\n1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:02.720\n You want to have this precompiled binary available\n\n1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:04.400\n that you're then just linking into.\n\n1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:09.040\n So there's real questions about the whole source code.\n\n1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:11.840\n Code is, running binary code is more than source code.\n\n1:49:11.840 --> 1:49:14.480\n It's creating object code, it's the linker, it's the loader,\n\n1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:15.600\n it's the how does that interpret it\n\n1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:17.640\n inside of virtual memory space.\n\n1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:19.160\n There's a lot of details there that actually\n\n1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:20.520\n I didn't understand for a long time\n\n1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:23.000\n until I read books on the topic.\n\n1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:27.060\n And it led to, the more you know, the better off you are\n\n1:49:27.060 --> 1:49:28.440\n and you can do more details,\n\n1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:31.280\n but sometimes it helps with abstractions too.\n\n1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:33.480\n Well, the problem, as we mentioned earlier\n\n1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:36.760\n with abstractions is you kind of sometimes assume\n\n1:49:37.700 --> 1:49:41.520\n that whoever implemented this thing\n\n1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:45.000\n had your case in mind and found the optimal solution.\n\n1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:45.840\n Yes.\n\n1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:47.320\n Or like you assume certain things.\n\n1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:48.160\n I mean, there's a lot of,\n\n1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:49.000\n Correct.\n\n1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:52.800\n One of the really powerful things to me early on,\n\n1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:55.480\n I mean, it sounds silly to say, but with Python,\n\n1:49:55.480 --> 1:49:58.440\n probably one of the reasons I fell in love with it\n\n1:49:58.440 --> 1:49:59.800\n is dictionaries.\n\n1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:00.920\n Yes.\n\n1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:03.680\n So obviously probably most languages\n\n1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:06.440\n have some mapping concept,\n\n1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:09.040\n but it felt like it was a first class citizen\n\n1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:12.200\n and it was just my brain was able to think in dictionaries.\n\n1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:14.640\n But then there's the thing that I guess I still use\n\n1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:16.920\n to this day is order dictionaries\n\n1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:20.120\n because that seems like a more natural way\n\n1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:21.680\n to construct dictionaries.\n\n1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:22.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:23.720\n And from a computer science perspective,\n\n1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:26.000\n the running time cost is not that significant,\n\n1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:30.400\n but there's a lot of things to understand about dictionaries\n\n1:50:30.400 --> 1:50:33.800\n that the abstraction kind of\n\n1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:37.400\n doesn't necessarily incentivize you to understand.\n\n1:50:37.400 --> 1:50:39.400\n Right, do you really understand the notion of a hash map\n\n1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:41.080\n and how the dictionary is implemented?\n\n1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:42.080\n But you're right.\n\n1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:43.440\n Dictionaries are a good example\n\n1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:44.920\n of an abstraction that's powerful.\n\n1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:46.000\n And I agree with you.\n\n1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:47.800\n I agree, I love dictionaries too.\n\n1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:49.160\n Took me a while to understand that once you do,\n\n1:50:49.160 --> 1:50:50.280\n you realize, oh, they're everywhere.\n\n1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:52.760\n And Python uses them everywhere too.\n\n1:50:52.760 --> 1:50:54.240\n Like it's actually constructed,\n\n1:50:54.240 --> 1:50:55.760\n one of the foundational things is dictionaries\n\n1:50:55.760 --> 1:50:57.560\n and it does everything with dictionaries.\n\n1:50:57.560 --> 1:50:58.600\n So it is, it's powerful.\n\n1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:00.160\n Order dictionaries came later,\n\n1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:02.200\n but it is very, very powerful.\n\n1:51:02.200 --> 1:51:03.400\n It took me a little while coming\n\n1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:05.960\n from just the array programming entirely\n\n1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:07.360\n to understand these other objects,\n\n1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:11.600\n like dictionaries and lists and tuples and binary trees.\n\n1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:13.360\n Like I said, I wasn't a computer scientist,\n\n1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:15.120\n I studied arrays first.\n\n1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:16.800\n And so I was very array centric.\n\n1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:17.960\n And you realize, oh, these others\n\n1:51:17.960 --> 1:51:20.140\n don't have purposes and value actually.\n\n1:51:21.200 --> 1:51:22.040\n I agree.\n\n1:51:22.040 --> 1:51:24.320\n There's a friendliness about,\n\n1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:26.760\n like one way to think about arrays\n\n1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:31.760\n is arrays are just like full of numbers,\n\n1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:35.000\n but to make them accessible to humans\n\n1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:38.700\n and make them less error prone to human users,\n\n1:51:38.700 --> 1:51:41.480\n sometimes you want to attach names,\n\n1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:43.120\n human interpretable names\n\n1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:44.720\n that are sticky to those arrays.\n\n1:51:44.720 --> 1:51:47.160\n So that's how you start to think about dictionaries\n\n1:51:47.160 --> 1:51:50.520\n is you start to convert numbers\n\n1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:52.120\n into something that's human interpretable.\n\n1:51:52.120 --> 1:51:55.320\n And that's actually the tension I've had with NumPy\n\n1:51:55.320 --> 1:51:58.160\n because I've built so much tooling\n\n1:51:58.160 --> 1:52:02.320\n around human interpretability\n\n1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:05.680\n and also protecting me from a year later\n\n1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:07.960\n not making the mistakes by being,\n\n1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:12.880\n I wanted to force myself to use English versus numbers.\n\n1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:15.680\n Yes, so there's a project called Labeled Arrays.\n\n1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:18.040\n Like very early it was recognized that,\n\n1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:21.320\n oh, we're indexing NumPy with just numbers,\n\n1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:23.640\n all the columns and particularly the dimensions.\n\n1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:25.520\n I mean, if you have an image,\n\n1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:27.680\n you don't necessarily need to label each column or row,\n\n1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:29.160\n but if you have a lot of images\n\n1:52:29.160 --> 1:52:30.440\n or you have another dimension,\n\n1:52:30.440 --> 1:52:31.640\n you'd at least like to label the dimension\n\n1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:33.120\n as this is X, this is Y, this is Z,\n\n1:52:33.120 --> 1:52:34.640\n or this is give us some human meaning\n\n1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:36.760\n or some domain specific meaning.\n\n1:52:36.760 --> 1:52:39.680\n That was one of the impetuses for Pandas actually\n\n1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:43.040\n was just, oh, we do need to label these things.\n\n1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:45.240\n And Label Array was an attempt to add\n\n1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:47.680\n that like a lighter weight version of that.\n\n1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:49.360\n And there's been, like, that's an example of something\n\n1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:53.080\n I think NumPy could add, could be added to NumPy,\n\n1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:55.000\n but one of the challenges again, how do you fund this?\n\n1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:58.280\n Like I said, one of the tragedies I think is that,\n\n1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:00.240\n so I never had the chance to,\n\n1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:02.360\n I was never paid to work on NumPy, right?\n\n1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:04.400\n So I've always just done it in my spare time,\n\n1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:05.880\n always taken from one thing,\n\n1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:07.920\n taken from another thing to do it.\n\n1:53:07.920 --> 1:53:09.800\n And at the time, I mean, today,\n\n1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:11.000\n it would be the wrong day and today,\n\n1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:12.160\n like paying me to work on NumPy now\n\n1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:13.480\n would not be a good use of effort,\n\n1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:16.640\n but we are finally at Quansight Labs,\n\n1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:19.440\n I'm actually paying people to work on NumPy and SciPy,\n\n1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:22.000\n which is I'm thrilled with, I'm excited by.\n\n1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:22.840\n I've wanted to do that.\n\n1:53:22.840 --> 1:53:24.280\n That's what I always wanted to do from day one.\n\n1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:27.640\n It just took me a while to figure out a mechanism to do that.\n\n1:53:27.640 --> 1:53:29.680\n Even like in the university setting,\n\n1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:33.840\n respecting that, like pushing students,\n\n1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:38.000\n young minds and young graduate students to contribute\n\n1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:41.160\n and then figuring out financial mechanisms\n\n1:53:41.160 --> 1:53:43.280\n that enable them to contribute\n\n1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:45.280\n and then sort of reward them\n\n1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:48.000\n for their innovative scientific journey,\n\n1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:49.160\n that would be nice.\n\n1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.360\n But then also just a better allocation of resources.\n\n1:53:53.360 --> 1:53:55.760\n It's 20 year anniversary since 9.11\n\n1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:59.240\n and I was just looking, we spent over $6 trillion\n\n1:53:59.240 --> 1:54:04.240\n in the Middle East after 9.11 in the various efforts there.\n\n1:54:04.560 --> 1:54:08.040\n And sort of to put politics and all that aside,\n\n1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:10.120\n it's just, you think about the education system,\n\n1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:11.320\n all the other ways we could have\n\n1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:12.920\n possibly allocated that money.\n\n1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:16.560\n To me, to take it back,\n\n1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:21.200\n the amount of impact you would have\n\n1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:26.200\n by allocating a little bit of money to the programmers\n\n1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:30.600\n that build the tools that run the world is fascinating.\n\n1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:31.440\n It is.\n\n1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:34.920\n I don't know, I think, again,\n\n1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:38.040\n there is some aspect to being broke\n\n1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:40.240\n as somewhat of a feature, not a bug,\n\n1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:42.320\n that you make sure that you're valued.\n\n1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:43.440\n But you can still manage that.\n\n1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:45.320\n Right, no, I know.\n\n1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:47.040\n But I don't think that's a big part.\n\n1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:50.720\n So it's like, I think you can have enough money\n\n1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:53.880\n and actually be wealthy while maintaining your values.\n\n1:54:53.880 --> 1:54:55.520\n Agreed, agreed.\n\n1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:57.800\n There's an old adage that nations that trade together\n\n1:54:57.800 --> 1:54:59.440\n don't go to war together.\n\n1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:01.680\n I've often thought about nations that code together.\n\n1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:02.520\n Yeah, code together.\n\n1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:03.360\n Right?\n\n1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:04.200\n I love that.\n\n1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:05.360\n Because one of the things I love about open source\n\n1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:07.880\n is it's global, it's multinational.\n\n1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:09.160\n Like there aren't national boundaries.\n\n1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:10.760\n One of the challenges with business and open source\n\n1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:12.800\n is the fact that, well, business is national.\n\n1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:13.960\n Like businesses are entities\n\n1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:16.240\n that are recognized in legal jurisdictions, right?\n\n1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:18.280\n And have laws that are respected in those jurisdictions\n\n1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:21.320\n and hiring, and yet the open source ecosystem\n\n1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:23.040\n is not, it's not there.\n\n1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:25.080\n Like currently, one of the problems we're solving\n\n1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:27.200\n is hiring people all over the world, right?\n\n1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:29.600\n Because we, it's a global effort.\n\n1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:31.920\n And I've had the chance to work, and I've loved the chance.\n\n1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:35.280\n I've never been to like Iran,\n\n1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:36.800\n but I once had a conference\n\n1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:38.640\n where I was able to talk to people there, right?\n\n1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:40.920\n And talk to folks in Pakistan.\n\n1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:44.080\n I've never been there, but we had a call\n\n1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:45.320\n where there were people there,\n\n1:55:45.320 --> 1:55:47.600\n like just scientists and normal people.\n\n1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:52.600\n And there's a certain amount of humanizing, right?\n\n1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:54.360\n That gets away from the,\n\n1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:56.200\n like we often get the memes of society\n\n1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:58.560\n that bubble up and get discussed,\n\n1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:00.760\n but the memes are not even an accurate reflection\n\n1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:02.400\n of the reality of what people are.\n\n1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:05.440\n Well, if you look at the major power centers\n\n1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:08.240\n that are leading to something like cyber war\n\n1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:10.000\n in the next few decades,\n\n1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:13.320\n it's the United States, it's Russia, and China.\n\n1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:16.080\n And those three countries in particular\n\n1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:18.240\n have incredible developers.\n\n1:56:18.240 --> 1:56:21.360\n So if they work together, I think that's one way,\n\n1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:23.360\n the politicians can do their stupid bickering,\n\n1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:27.360\n but like there's a layer of infrastructure, of humanity.\n\n1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:29.400\n If they collaborate together,\n\n1:56:29.400 --> 1:56:34.080\n that I think can prevent major military conflict,\n\n1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:37.840\n which would, I think most likely happen at the cyber level\n\n1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:39.800\n versus the actual hot war level.\n\n1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:40.640\n You're right.\n\n1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:43.320\n You know, I think that's a good prediction.\n\n1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:46.560\n Nations that code together don't go to war together.\n\n1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:47.880\n Don't go to war together.\n\n1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:48.720\n That's a hope, right?\n\n1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:51.160\n That's one of the philosophical hopes, but yeah.\n\n1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:55.640\n So you mentioned the project of Numba,\n\n1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:58.520\n which is fascinating.\n\n1:56:58.520 --> 1:56:59.720\n So from the early days,\n\n1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:04.560\n there was kind of a pushback on Python that it's not fast.\n\n1:57:04.560 --> 1:57:05.520\n You know, you see C plus,\n\n1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:06.920\n if you wanna write something that's fast,\n\n1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:08.240\n you use C plus plus.\n\n1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:11.320\n If you wanna write something that's usable and friendly,\n\n1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:13.240\n but slow, you use Python.\n\n1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:15.840\n And so what is Numba?\n\n1:57:15.840 --> 1:57:16.800\n What is its goal?\n\n1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:17.640\n How does it work?\n\n1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:18.480\n Great, yeah.\n\n1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:19.760\n Yes, that's what the argument.\n\n1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:22.440\n And the reality was people would write high level coding\n\n1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:23.440\n and use compiled code,\n\n1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:25.240\n but there's still user stories, use cases,\n\n1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:27.440\n where you want to write Python,\n\n1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:28.880\n but then have it still be fast.\n\n1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:30.720\n You still need to write a for loop.\n\n1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:33.920\n Like before Numba, it was always don't write a for loop.\n\n1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:35.800\n You know, write it in a vectorized way,\n\n1:57:35.800 --> 1:57:37.240\n you know, put it in an array.\n\n1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:39.640\n And often that can make a memory trade off.\n\n1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:41.080\n Like quite often you can do it,\n\n1:57:41.080 --> 1:57:42.720\n but then you make maybe use more memory\n\n1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:44.920\n because you have to build this array of data\n\n1:57:44.920 --> 1:57:46.680\n that you don't necessarily need all the time.\n\n1:57:46.680 --> 1:57:50.960\n So Numba was, it started from a desire to have\n\n1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:52.840\n kind of a vectorized that worked.\n\n1:57:52.840 --> 1:57:56.260\n A vectorized was a tool in NumPy, it was released.\n\n1:57:56.260 --> 1:57:57.800\n You give it a Python function\n\n1:57:57.800 --> 1:57:59.680\n and it gave you a universal function,\n\n1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:01.120\n a ufunc that would work on arrays.\n\n1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:03.640\n So you get the function that just worked on a scaler.\n\n1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:04.880\n Like you could make a,\n\n1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:07.280\n like the classic case was a simple function\n\n1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:08.280\n that an if then statement in it.\n\n1:58:08.280 --> 1:58:12.160\n So sine X over X function, sync function.\n\n1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:15.120\n If X equals zero, return one, otherwise do sine X over X.\n\n1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:17.760\n The challenge is you don't want that loop\n\n1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:18.720\n peg one in Python.\n\n1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:21.480\n So you want a compiled version of that,\n\n1:58:21.480 --> 1:58:23.160\n but the ufunc, the vectorized in NumPy\n\n1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:24.840\n would just give you a Python function.\n\n1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:26.720\n So it would take the array of numbers\n\n1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:29.560\n and at every call do a loop back into Python.\n\n1:58:29.560 --> 1:58:30.440\n So it was very slow.\n\n1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:31.800\n It gave you the appearance of a ufunc,\n\n1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:32.840\n but it was very slow.\n\n1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:34.600\n So I always wanted a vectorized\n\n1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:36.280\n that would take that Python scaler function\n\n1:58:36.280 --> 1:58:39.480\n and produce a ufunc working on binary native code.\n\n1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:42.800\n So in fact, I had somebody work on that with PyPy\n\n1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:45.640\n and see if PyPy could be used to produce a ufunc like that\n\n1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:50.560\n early on in 2009 or something like that, 2010.\n\n1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:51.480\n They didn't work that well.\n\n1:58:51.480 --> 1:58:52.880\n It was kind of pretty bulky.\n\n1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:57.000\n But in 2012, Peter and I had just started Anaconda.\n\n1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:00.680\n We had, I just, I'd learned to raise money.\n\n1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:01.640\n That's a different topic,\n\n1:59:01.640 --> 1:59:04.640\n but I'd learned to raise money from friends, family,\n\n1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:05.960\n and fools, as they say.\n\n1:59:05.960 --> 1:59:06.800\n And.\n\n1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:07.840\n That's a good line.\n\n1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:11.200\n Oh, that's a good line.\n\n1:59:11.200 --> 1:59:13.440\n But, so we were trying to do something.\n\n1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:14.680\n We were trying to change the world.\n\n1:59:14.680 --> 1:59:15.840\n Peter and I are super ambitious.\n\n1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:17.600\n We wanted to make array computing\n\n1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:19.480\n and we had ideas for really what's still,\n\n1:59:19.480 --> 1:59:20.640\n it's still the energy right now.\n\n1:59:20.640 --> 1:59:23.520\n How do you do at scale data science?\n\n1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:25.840\n And we had a bunch of ideas there, but one of them,\n\n1:59:25.840 --> 1:59:27.720\n I had just talked to people about LLVM\n\n1:59:27.720 --> 1:59:30.040\n and I was like, there's a way to do this.\n\n1:59:30.040 --> 1:59:32.600\n I just, I went, I heard about my friend Dave Beasley\n\n1:59:32.600 --> 1:59:33.920\n at a compiler course.\n\n1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:35.560\n So I was looking at compilers like,\n\n1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:37.640\n and I realized, oh, this is what you do.\n\n1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:40.040\n And so I wrote a version of Numba\n\n1:59:40.040 --> 1:59:45.040\n that just basically mapped Python bytecode to LLVM.\n\n1:59:45.640 --> 1:59:46.480\n Nice.\n\n1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:49.200\n Right, so, and the first version is like, this works\n\n1:59:49.200 --> 1:59:50.840\n and it produces code that's fast.\n\n1:59:50.840 --> 1:59:51.960\n This is cool for, you know,\n\n1:59:51.960 --> 1:59:53.440\n obviously a reduced subset of Python.\n\n1:59:53.440 --> 1:59:55.360\n I didn't support all the Python language.\n\n1:59:55.360 --> 1:59:57.480\n There had been efforts to speed up Python in the past,\n\n1:59:57.480 --> 1:59:59.200\n but those efforts were, I would say,\n\n1:59:59.200 --> 2:00:00.840\n not from the array computing perspective,\n\n2:00:00.840 --> 2:00:02.160\n not from the perspective of wanting to produce\n\n2:00:02.160 --> 2:00:03.560\n a vectorized improvement.\n\n2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:05.120\n They were from the perspective of speeding up\n\n2:00:05.120 --> 2:00:07.520\n the runtime of Python, which is fundamentally hard\n\n2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:10.520\n because Python allows for some constructs\n\n2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:12.160\n that aren't, you can't speed up.\n\n2:00:12.160 --> 2:00:15.560\n Like it's this generic, you know, when it does this variable.\n\n2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:17.720\n So I, from the start, did not try to replicate\n\n2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:20.280\n Python's semantics entirely.\n\n2:00:20.280 --> 2:00:23.000\n I said, I'm gonna take a subset of the Python syntax\n\n2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:25.080\n and let people write syntax in Python,\n\n2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:27.440\n but it's kind of a new language really.\n\n2:00:27.440 --> 2:00:30.480\n So it's almost like four loops, like focusing on four loops.\n\n2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:34.400\n Four loops, scalar arithmetic, you know, typed,\n\n2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:37.200\n you know, really typed language, a typed subset.\n\n2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:39.360\n That was the key.\n\n2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:41.880\n So, but we wanted to add inference of types.\n\n2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:43.400\n So you didn't have to spell all the types out\n\n2:00:43.400 --> 2:00:45.840\n because when you call a function,\n\n2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:48.040\n so Python is typed, it's just dynamically typed.\n\n2:00:48.040 --> 2:00:49.360\n So you don't tell it what the types are,\n\n2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:52.080\n but when it runs, every time an object runs,\n\n2:00:52.080 --> 2:00:53.360\n there's a type for the variables.\n\n2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:54.560\n You know what it is.\n\n2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:56.800\n And so that was the design goals of Numba\n\n2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:59.200\n were to make it possible to write functions\n\n2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:03.440\n that could be compiled and have them used for NumPy arrays.\n\n2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:05.520\n Like they needed to support NumPy arrays.\n\n2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:07.040\n And so how does it work?\n\n2:01:07.040 --> 2:01:10.200\n Do you add a comment within Python that tells it to do,\n\n2:01:10.200 --> 2:01:11.880\n like how do you help out the compiler?\n\n2:01:11.880 --> 2:01:15.860\n Yeah, so there isn't much actually.\n\n2:01:15.860 --> 2:01:17.740\n You don't, it's kind of magical in the sense\n\n2:01:17.740 --> 2:01:19.600\n that it just looks at the type of the objects\n\n2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:21.320\n and then it's typed inference to determine\n\n2:01:21.320 --> 2:01:23.320\n any other variables it needs.\n\n2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:26.080\n And then it was also, because we had a use case\n\n2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:28.280\n that could work early.\n\n2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:30.700\n Like one of the challenges of any kind of new development\n\n2:01:30.700 --> 2:01:32.280\n is if you have something that to make it work,\n\n2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:34.200\n it was gonna take you a long time,\n\n2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:35.960\n it's really hard to get out off the ground.\n\n2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:39.200\n If you have a project where there's some incremental story,\n\n2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:42.300\n it can start working today and solve a problem,\n\n2:01:42.300 --> 2:01:44.640\n then you can start getting it out there, getting feedback.\n\n2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:48.160\n Because Numba today, now Numba is nine years old today,\n\n2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:52.120\n the first two, three versions were not great, right?\n\n2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:54.120\n But they solved a problem and some people could try it\n\n2:01:54.120 --> 2:01:55.560\n and we could get some feedback on it.\n\n2:01:55.560 --> 2:01:57.520\n Not great in that it was very focused.\n\n2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:02.000\n Very fragile, the subset it would actually compile\n\n2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.320\n was small and so if you wrote Python code\n\n2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:06.880\n and said, so the way it worked is you write a function\n\n2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:09.000\n and you say at JIT, use decorators.\n\n2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.040\n So decorators, just these little constructs\n\n2:02:11.040 --> 2:02:15.040\n let you decorate code with an at and then a name.\n\n2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:17.760\n The at JIT would take your Python function\n\n2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:20.240\n and actually just compile it and replace the Python function\n\n2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:23.200\n with another function that interacts\n\n2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:24.920\n with this compiled function.\n\n2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:28.480\n And it would just do that and we went from Python bytecode\n\n2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:29.400\n then we went to AST.\n\n2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:31.200\n I mean, writing compilers actually,\n\n2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:32.940\n I learned a lot about why computer science\n\n2:02:32.940 --> 2:02:35.560\n is taught the way it is because compilers\n\n2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:36.640\n can be hard to write.\n\n2:02:36.640 --> 2:02:39.080\n They use tree structures, they use all the concepts\n\n2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:40.520\n of computer science that are needed.\n\n2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:44.600\n It's actually hard to, it's easy to write a compiler\n\n2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:46.000\n and then have it be spaghetti code.\n\n2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:47.600\n Like the passes become challenging\n\n2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:49.940\n and we ended up with three versions of Numba, right?\n\n2:02:49.940 --> 2:02:51.540\n Numba got written three times.\n\n2:02:51.540 --> 2:02:55.560\n What programming language is Numba written in?\n\n2:02:55.560 --> 2:02:56.440\n Python.\n\n2:02:56.440 --> 2:02:57.440\n Wait, okay.\n\n2:02:57.440 --> 2:02:58.640\n Yeah, Python.\n\n2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:00.040\n So.\n\n2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:00.860\n Really?\n\n2:03:00.860 --> 2:03:01.700\n That's fascinating.\n\n2:03:01.700 --> 2:03:03.520\n Yeah, so Python, but then the whole goal of Numba\n\n2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:07.480\n is to translate Python bytecode to LLVM.\n\n2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:09.400\n And so LLVM actually does the code generation.\n\n2:03:09.400 --> 2:03:10.780\n In fact, a lot of times they'd say,\n\n2:03:10.780 --> 2:03:12.780\n yeah, it's super easy to write a compiler\n\n2:03:12.780 --> 2:03:15.880\n if you're not writing the parser nor the code generator.\n\n2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:16.720\n Right?\n\n2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:19.440\n So for people who don't know, LLVM is a compiler itself.\n\n2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:20.360\n So your compiler.\n\n2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:22.680\n Yeah, it's really badly named low level virtual machine,\n\n2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:24.480\n which that part of it is not used.\n\n2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:25.320\n It's really low level.\n\n2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:26.160\n Chris, he doesn't mean that.\n\n2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:29.280\n Yeah, love Chris.\n\n2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:31.640\n But the name makes you imply that the virtual machine\n\n2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:32.480\n is what it's all about.\n\n2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:34.520\n It's actually the IR and the library,\n\n2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:36.000\n the code generation.\n\n2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:37.680\n That's the real beauty of it.\n\n2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:39.360\n The fact that, what I love about LLVM\n\n2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:43.200\n was the fact that it was a plateau you could collaborate on.\n\n2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:44.040\n Right?\n\n2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:45.880\n Instead of the internals of GCC\n\n2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:47.440\n or the internals of the Intel compiler,\n\n2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:49.120\n or like how do I extend that?\n\n2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:51.020\n And it was a place we could collaborate.\n\n2:03:51.020 --> 2:03:52.400\n And we were early.\n\n2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:54.000\n I mean, people had started before.\n\n2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:55.240\n It's a slow compiler.\n\n2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:56.840\n Like it's not a fast compiler.\n\n2:03:56.840 --> 2:03:59.520\n So for some kind of JITs,\n\n2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:01.040\n like JITs are common in language\n\n2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:04.760\n because one, every browser has a JavaScript JIT.\n\n2:04:04.760 --> 2:04:06.560\n It does real time compilation\n\n2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:09.080\n of the JavaScript to machine code.\n\n2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:11.520\n For people who don't know, JIT is just in time compilation.\n\n2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:12.340\n Thank you.\n\n2:04:12.340 --> 2:04:13.240\n Yeah, just in time compilation.\n\n2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:14.840\n They're actually really sophisticated.\n\n2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:17.100\n In fact, I got jealous of how much effort\n\n2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:18.600\n was put into the JavaScript JITs.\n\n2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:20.800\n Yes, well, it's kind of incredible what they've done.\n\n2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:22.760\n Yes, I completely agree.\n\n2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:23.840\n I'm very impressed.\n\n2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:26.880\n But you know, Numba was an effort\n\n2:04:26.880 --> 2:04:29.320\n to make that happen with Python.\n\n2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:30.960\n And so we used some of the money\n\n2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:32.440\n we raised from Anaconda to do it.\n\n2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:34.800\n And then we also applied for this DARPA grant\n\n2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:36.820\n and used some of that money to continue the development.\n\n2:04:36.820 --> 2:04:40.680\n And then we used proceeds from service projects we would do.\n\n2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:41.800\n We get consulting projects\n\n2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:44.480\n that we would then use some of the profits\n\n2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:45.400\n to invest in Numba.\n\n2:04:45.400 --> 2:04:47.160\n So we ended up with a team of two or three people\n\n2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:48.880\n working on Numba.\n\n2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:50.720\n It was a fits and starts, right?\n\n2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:53.560\n And ultimately, the fact that we had a commercial version\n\n2:04:53.560 --> 2:04:54.720\n of it also we were writing.\n\n2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:56.640\n So part of the way I was trying to fund Numba,\n\n2:04:56.640 --> 2:04:58.560\n say, well, let's do the free Numba\n\n2:04:58.560 --> 2:04:59.920\n and then we'll have a commercial version of Numba\n\n2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:00.820\n called Numba Pro.\n\n2:05:00.820 --> 2:05:03.240\n And what Numba Pro did is it targeted GPUs.\n\n2:05:03.240 --> 2:05:05.520\n So we had the very first CUDA JIT\n\n2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:10.520\n and the very first at JIT compiler that in 2012 for 13,\n\n2:05:10.840 --> 2:05:14.140\n you could run not just a view func on CPU,\n\n2:05:14.140 --> 2:05:15.640\n but a view func on GPUs.\n\n2:05:15.640 --> 2:05:17.480\n And it would automatically paralyze it\n\n2:05:17.480 --> 2:05:18.840\n and get 1000X speed on it.\n\n2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:21.120\n And that's an interesting funding mechanism\n\n2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:26.120\n because large companies or larger companies\n\n2:05:26.860 --> 2:05:30.120\n care about speed in just this way.\n\n2:05:30.120 --> 2:05:33.140\n So it's exactly a really good way.\n\n2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:34.240\n Yeah, there's been a couple of things\n\n2:05:34.240 --> 2:05:35.200\n you know people will pay for.\n\n2:05:35.200 --> 2:05:37.960\n One, they'll pay for really good user interfaces, right?\n\n2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:40.160\n And so I'm always looking for what are the things\n\n2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:41.720\n people will pay for that you could actually adapt\n\n2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:43.240\n to the open source infrastructure?\n\n2:05:43.240 --> 2:05:45.560\n One is definitely user interfaces.\n\n2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:49.120\n The second is speed, like a better runtime, faster runtime.\n\n2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:50.000\n And then when you say people,\n\n2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.280\n you mean like a small number of people pay a lot of money,\n\n2:05:52.280 --> 2:05:54.440\n but then there's also this other mechanism that.\n\n2:05:54.440 --> 2:05:55.280\n That's true.\n\n2:05:55.280 --> 2:05:56.400\n A ton of people pay.\n\n2:05:56.400 --> 2:05:57.220\n That's true.\n\n2:05:57.220 --> 2:05:58.060\n A little bit.\n\n2:05:58.060 --> 2:06:00.320\n First, I gotta, we mentioned Anaconda,\n\n2:06:00.320 --> 2:06:04.280\n we mentioned friends, family, and fools.\n\n2:06:04.280 --> 2:06:06.800\n So Anaconda is yet another.\n\n2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:09.080\n So there's a company, but there's also a project.\n\n2:06:09.080 --> 2:06:09.920\n Correct.\n\n2:06:09.920 --> 2:06:14.600\n That is exceptionally impactful in terms of,\n\n2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:16.880\n for many reasons, but one of which is bringing\n\n2:06:16.880 --> 2:06:21.880\n a lot more people into the community\n\n2:06:21.960 --> 2:06:23.640\n of folks who use Python.\n\n2:06:23.640 --> 2:06:26.920\n So what is Anaconda?\n\n2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:28.960\n What is its goals?\n\n2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:31.540\n Maybe what is Conda versus Anaconda?\n\n2:06:31.540 --> 2:06:33.080\n Yeah, I'll tell you a little bit of the history of that.\n\n2:06:33.080 --> 2:06:35.280\n Cause Anaconda, we wanted to do,\n\n2:06:35.280 --> 2:06:37.440\n we wanted to scale Python.\n\n2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:38.680\n Cause we, you know, that was the goal.\n\n2:06:38.680 --> 2:06:40.720\n Peter and I had the goal of when we started Anaconda,\n\n2:06:40.720 --> 2:06:42.440\n we actually started as Continuum Analytics\n\n2:06:42.440 --> 2:06:44.000\n was the name of the company that started.\n\n2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:47.000\n It got renamed Anaconda in 2015.\n\n2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.880\n But we said, we want to scale analytics.\n\n2:06:49.880 --> 2:06:52.680\n NumPy is great, Pandas is emerging,\n\n2:06:52.680 --> 2:06:55.320\n but these need to run at scale with lots of machines.\n\n2:06:55.320 --> 2:06:57.920\n The other thing we wanted to do was make user interfaces\n\n2:06:57.920 --> 2:06:59.360\n that were web.\n\n2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:01.320\n We wanted to make sure the web did not pass\n\n2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:02.920\n by the Python community.\n\n2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:06.000\n That we had ways to translate your data science to the web.\n\n2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:07.720\n So those are the two kind of technical areas.\n\n2:07:07.720 --> 2:07:09.920\n We thought, oh, we'll build products in this space.\n\n2:07:09.920 --> 2:07:12.500\n And that was the idea.\n\n2:07:12.500 --> 2:07:13.640\n Very quickly in, but of course,\n\n2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:15.760\n the thing I knew how to do was to do consulting\n\n2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:18.920\n to make money and to make sure my family and friends\n\n2:07:18.920 --> 2:07:21.680\n and fools that had invested didn't lose their money.\n\n2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:22.640\n So it's a little different\n\n2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:24.360\n than if you take money from a venture fund.\n\n2:07:24.360 --> 2:07:25.520\n If you take money from a venture fund,\n\n2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:27.720\n the venture fund, they want you to go big or go home.\n\n2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:30.280\n And they're kind of like expecting nine out of 10 to fail\n\n2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:33.080\n or 99 out of 100 to fail.\n\n2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:33.920\n It's different.\n\n2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:35.480\n I was, I was owed a barbell strategy.\n\n2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:37.280\n I was like, I can't fail.\n\n2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:38.680\n I mean, I may not do super well,\n\n2:07:38.680 --> 2:07:40.440\n but I cannot lose their money.\n\n2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:43.560\n So I'm going to do something I know can return a profit,\n\n2:07:43.560 --> 2:07:46.320\n but I want to have exposure to an upside.\n\n2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:47.920\n So that's what happened at Anaconda.\n\n2:07:47.920 --> 2:07:50.320\n We didn't, there was lots of things we did not well\n\n2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:51.320\n in terms of that structure.\n\n2:07:51.320 --> 2:07:53.740\n And I've learned from since and how to do it better.\n\n2:07:53.740 --> 2:07:56.700\n But we've, we did a really good job\n\n2:07:56.700 --> 2:07:59.140\n of kind of attracting the interest around the area\n\n2:07:59.140 --> 2:08:00.360\n to get good people working\n\n2:08:00.360 --> 2:08:01.700\n and then get funnel some money\n\n2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:03.080\n on some interesting projects.\n\n2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:05.200\n Super excited about what came out of our energy there.\n\n2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:06.840\n Like a lot did.\n\n2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:08.280\n So what are some of the interesting projects?\n\n2:08:08.280 --> 2:08:12.120\n So Dask, Numba, Bokeh, Conda.\n\n2:08:12.120 --> 2:08:15.200\n There was a data shader, Panel, Holoviz.\n\n2:08:16.200 --> 2:08:19.040\n These are all tools that are extremely relevant\n\n2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:21.400\n in terms of helping you build applications,\n\n2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:25.060\n build tools, build, you know, faster code.\n\n2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:25.900\n There's a couple I'm forgetting.\n\n2:08:25.900 --> 2:08:28.680\n Oh, JupyterLab, JupyterLab came out of this too.\n\n2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:30.320\n And yeah.\n\n2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:32.700\n Okay, so Bokeh does plotting?\n\n2:08:32.700 --> 2:08:33.540\n Is that?\n\n2:08:33.540 --> 2:08:34.360\n Bokeh does plotting.\n\n2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:35.880\n So Bokeh was one of the foundational things to say,\n\n2:08:35.880 --> 2:08:37.360\n I want to do plot in Python,\n\n2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:39.140\n but have the things show up in a web.\n\n2:08:39.140 --> 2:08:40.040\n Right, that's right.\n\n2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:40.880\n That's right, that's right.\n\n2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:43.280\n And plotting to me still,\n\n2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:46.480\n with all due respect to Matplotlib and Bokeh,\n\n2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:48.760\n it feels like still an unsolved problem,\n\n2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:50.260\n not a solved problem.\n\n2:08:50.260 --> 2:08:52.160\n It is, it's a big problem.\n\n2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:55.640\n Right, because you're, I mean, I don't know,\n\n2:08:55.640 --> 2:08:58.640\n it's visualization broadly, right?\n\n2:08:58.640 --> 2:09:00.960\n I think we've got a pretty good API story\n\n2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:03.440\n around certain use cases of plotting.\n\n2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:04.920\n But there's a difference between static plots\n\n2:09:04.920 --> 2:09:07.800\n versus interactive plots versus I'm an end user,\n\n2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:09.760\n I just want to write a simple,\n\n2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:12.040\n for Pandas started the idea of here's a data frame\n\n2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:14.200\n on a dot plot, I'm just going to attach plot\n\n2:09:14.200 --> 2:09:16.380\n as a method to my object,\n\n2:09:16.380 --> 2:09:18.280\n which was a little bit controversial, right?\n\n2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:20.160\n But works pretty well, actually,\n\n2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:23.680\n because there's a lot less you have to pass in, right?\n\n2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:26.280\n You can just say, here's my object, you know what you are,\n\n2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:29.000\n you tell the visualization what to do.\n\n2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.320\n So that, and there's things like that\n\n2:09:31.320 --> 2:09:33.720\n that have not been super well developed entirely,\n\n2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:36.320\n but Bokeh was focused on interactive plotting.\n\n2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:38.400\n So you could, it's a short path\n\n2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:41.080\n between interactive plotting and application,\n\n2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:42.680\n dashboard application.\n\n2:09:42.680 --> 2:09:44.760\n And there's some incredible work that got done there, right?\n\n2:09:44.760 --> 2:09:45.800\n And it was a hard project,\n\n2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:49.440\n because then you're basically doing JavaScript and Python.\n\n2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:51.560\n So we wanted to tackle some of these hard problems\n\n2:09:51.560 --> 2:09:53.440\n and try to just go after them.\n\n2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:54.920\n We got some DARPA funding to help,\n\n2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:56.880\n and it was super helpful, funny story there,\n\n2:09:56.880 --> 2:09:58.320\n we actually did two DARPA proposals,\n\n2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:00.580\n but one we were five minutes late for.\n\n2:10:00.580 --> 2:10:03.040\n And DARPA has a very strict cutoff window.\n\n2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:04.760\n And so I, we had two proposals,\n\n2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:06.720\n one for the Bokeh and one for actually Numba\n\n2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:09.320\n and the other work.\n\n2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:10.920\n Which one were you late for?\n\n2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:12.920\n The Foundation on Numerical Work.\n\n2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:14.880\n So Bokeh got funded. Oh no.\n\n2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:17.120\n Fortunately, Chris let us use some of the money to fund\n\n2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:19.320\n still some of the other foundational work,\n\n2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:22.040\n but it wasn't as, yeah, his hands were tired,\n\n2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:23.880\n he couldn't do anything about it.\n\n2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:25.880\n That was a whole interesting story.\n\n2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:27.700\n So one of the incredible projects\n\n2:10:27.700 --> 2:10:29.200\n that you worked on is Conda.\n\n2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:30.040\n Yes.\n\n2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:31.400\n So what is Conda? So how that came about,\n\n2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:35.480\n yeah, Conda, it was early on, like I said, with SciPy.\n\n2:10:35.480 --> 2:10:37.880\n SciPy was a distribution mass generation library.\n\n2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:40.320\n And he said, he heard me talking about compiler issues\n\n2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:41.480\n and trying to get the stuff shipped\n\n2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:43.320\n and the fact that people can use your libraries\n\n2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:44.660\n if they have it.\n\n2:10:44.660 --> 2:10:45.500\n So for a long time,\n\n2:10:45.500 --> 2:10:47.800\n we'd understood the packaging problem in Python.\n\n2:10:47.800 --> 2:10:50.680\n And one of the first things he did at Conda Analytics\n\n2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:54.240\n became Anaconda was organize the Pi data ecosystem\n\n2:10:54.240 --> 2:10:56.160\n in conjunction with NumFocus.\n\n2:10:56.160 --> 2:10:57.960\n We actually started NumFocus\n\n2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:00.480\n with some other folks in the community\n\n2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:02.880\n the same year we started Anaconda.\n\n2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:04.200\n I said, we're gonna build a corporation,\n\n2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:07.040\n but we're also gonna reify the community aspect\n\n2:11:07.040 --> 2:11:08.280\n and build a nonprofit.\n\n2:11:08.280 --> 2:11:09.400\n So we did both of those.\n\n2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:13.280\n Can we pause real quick and can you say what is PyPy,\n\n2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:14.720\n the Python package index,\n\n2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:19.300\n like this whole story of packaging in Python?\n\n2:11:19.300 --> 2:11:20.880\n Yeah, that's what I'm gonna get to actually.\n\n2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:22.240\n This is exactly the journey I'm on.\n\n2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:24.200\n It's to sort of explain packaging in Python.\n\n2:11:24.200 --> 2:11:26.080\n I think it's best expressed to the conversation\n\n2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:27.600\n I had with Guido at a conference,\n\n2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:31.280\n where I said, so packaging is kind of a problem.\n\n2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:34.080\n And Guido said, I don't ever care about packaging.\n\n2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:34.920\n I don't use it.\n\n2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:36.320\n I don't install new libraries.\n\n2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:38.200\n I'm like, I guess if you're the language creator\n\n2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:40.480\n and if you need something, you just put it in the distribution\n\n2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:42.520\n maybe you don't worry about packaging.\n\n2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:45.200\n But Guido has never really cared about packaging, right?\n\n2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:47.400\n And never really cared about the problem of distribution.\n\n2:11:47.400 --> 2:11:48.480\n It's somebody else's problem.\n\n2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:50.240\n And that's a fair position to take, I think,\n\n2:11:50.240 --> 2:11:51.480\n as a language creator.\n\n2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:54.160\n In fact, there's a philosophical question about\n\n2:11:54.160 --> 2:11:56.680\n should you have different development packaging managers?\n\n2:11:56.680 --> 2:11:58.400\n Should you have a package manager per language?\n\n2:11:58.400 --> 2:11:59.800\n Is that really the right approach?\n\n2:11:59.800 --> 2:12:01.900\n I think there are some answers of\n\n2:12:01.900 --> 2:12:04.200\n it is appropriate to have development tools.\n\n2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:06.040\n And there's an aspect of a development tool\n\n2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:07.680\n that is related to packaging.\n\n2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:10.600\n And every language should have some story there\n\n2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:12.120\n to help their developers create.\n\n2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:14.960\n So you should have language specific development tools.\n\n2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:17.080\n Development tools that relate to package managers.\n\n2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:19.520\n But then there's a very specific user story\n\n2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:20.680\n around package management\n\n2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:22.240\n that those language specific package managers\n\n2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:23.560\n have to interact with.\n\n2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:25.920\n And currently aren't doing a good job of that.\n\n2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:27.000\n That was one of the challenges\n\n2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.140\n that not seeing that difference,\n\n2:12:29.140 --> 2:12:31.720\n and it still exists in the difference today.\n\n2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:34.480\n Conda always was a user.\n\n2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:36.540\n I'm gonna use Python to do data science.\n\n2:12:36.540 --> 2:12:38.240\n I'm gonna use Python to do something.\n\n2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:39.560\n How do I get this installed?\n\n2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:41.160\n It was always focused on that.\n\n2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:43.880\n So it didn't have a develop.\n\n2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:45.960\n Classic example is pip has a pip develop.\n\n2:12:45.960 --> 2:12:47.480\n It's like, I wanna install this\n\n2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:50.280\n into my current development environment today.\n\n2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:51.520\n Conda doesn't have that concept\n\n2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:52.840\n because it's not part of the story.\n\n2:12:52.840 --> 2:12:54.640\n For people who don't know,\n\n2:12:54.640 --> 2:12:59.640\n pip is a Python specific package manager.\n\n2:12:59.640 --> 2:13:04.640\n That's exceptionally popular.\n\n2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:06.520\n That's probably like the default thing you've learned.\n\n2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:07.360\n It's the default user.\n\n2:13:07.360 --> 2:13:08.840\n And so the story there emerged\n\n2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:11.480\n because what happened is in 2012,\n\n2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:13.760\n we had this meeting at the Googleplex\n\n2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:15.600\n and Guido was there to come talk about what we're gonna do,\n\n2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:17.240\n how we're gonna make things work better.\n\n2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:19.960\n And Wes McKinney, me, Peter,\n\n2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:21.880\n Peter has a great photo of me talking to Guido\n\n2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:23.560\n and he pretends we're talking about this story.\n\n2:13:23.560 --> 2:13:24.680\n Maybe we were, maybe we weren't.\n\n2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:26.320\n But we did at that meeting talk about it\n\n2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:29.920\n and asked Guido, we need to fix packaging in Python.\n\n2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:31.040\n People can't get the stuff.\n\n2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:32.400\n And he said, go fix it yourself.\n\n2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:33.600\n I don't think we're gonna do it.\n\n2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:35.720\n All right.\n\n2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:36.960\n The origin story right there.\n\n2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:39.440\n All right, you said, okay, you said to do this ourselves.\n\n2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:41.640\n So at the same time,\n\n2:13:41.640 --> 2:13:44.600\n people did start to work on the packaging story in Python.\n\n2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:45.680\n It just took a little longer.\n\n2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:48.160\n So in 2012, kind of motivated\n\n2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:49.600\n by our training courses we were teaching,\n\n2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:51.440\n like very similar to what you just mentioned\n\n2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:52.280\n about your mother.\n\n2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:54.160\n Like it was motivated by the same purpose.\n\n2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:56.040\n Like how do we get this into people's hands?\n\n2:13:56.040 --> 2:13:57.120\n It's this big, long process.\n\n2:13:57.120 --> 2:13:58.520\n It takes too expensive.\n\n2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:00.200\n It was actually hurting NumPy development\n\n2:14:00.200 --> 2:14:02.280\n because I would hear people were saying,\n\n2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:03.480\n don't make that change to NumPy\n\n2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:05.480\n because I just spent a week getting my Python environment.\n\n2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:09.160\n And if you change NumPy, I have to reinstall everything.\n\n2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:10.880\n And reinstalling is such a pain, don't do it.\n\n2:14:10.880 --> 2:14:12.120\n I'm like, wait, okay.\n\n2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:14.640\n So now we're not making changes to a library\n\n2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:16.000\n because of the installation problem\n\n2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:17.440\n that it'll cause for end users.\n\n2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:19.400\n Okay, there's a problem with installation.\n\n2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:20.520\n We gotta fix this.\n\n2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:23.760\n So we said, we're gonna make a distribution in Python.\n\n2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:24.760\n And we'd previously done that.\n\n2:14:24.760 --> 2:14:26.920\n I'd previously done that at mthought.\n\n2:14:26.920 --> 2:14:28.520\n I wanted to make one that would give away for free,\n\n2:14:28.520 --> 2:14:29.840\n that everyone could just get.\n\n2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:32.080\n Like that was critical that we could just get it.\n\n2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:33.880\n It wasn't tied to a product.\n\n2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:35.360\n It was just you could get it.\n\n2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:36.960\n And then we had constantly thought about,\n\n2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:39.120\n well, do we just leverage RPM?\n\n2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:40.400\n But the challenge had always been,\n\n2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:42.240\n we want a package manager that works on Windows,\n\n2:14:42.240 --> 2:14:45.040\n Mac OS X, and Linux the same, right?\n\n2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:46.560\n And it wasn't there.\n\n2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:47.960\n Like you don't have anything like that.\n\n2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:48.800\n You have...\n\n2:14:48.800 --> 2:14:49.640\n And for people who don't know,\n\n2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:54.560\n RPM is an operating system specific package manager.\n\n2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:55.960\n Correct, it's an operating specific.\n\n2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:56.800\n Yes, exactly.\n\n2:14:56.800 --> 2:15:00.160\n So do you create the design questions,\n\n2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:02.240\n do you create an umbrella package manager\n\n2:15:02.240 --> 2:15:03.840\n that works across operating systems?\n\n2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:05.680\n Yes, that was the decision.\n\n2:15:05.680 --> 2:15:08.080\n And in neighboring design questions,\n\n2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:09.920\n do you also create a package manager\n\n2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:11.840\n that spans multiple programming languages?\n\n2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:12.760\n Correct, exactly.\n\n2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:14.280\n That was the world we faced.\n\n2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:17.080\n And we decided to go multiple operating systems,\n\n2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:19.220\n multiple and programming language independent.\n\n2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:21.800\n Because even Python, and particularly what was important\n\n2:15:21.800 --> 2:15:24.920\n was SciPy has a bunch of Fortran in it, right?\n\n2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:27.760\n And scikit learn has links to a bunch of C++.\n\n2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:29.960\n There's a lot of compiled code.\n\n2:15:29.960 --> 2:15:32.920\n And the Python package managers, especially early on,\n\n2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:34.320\n didn't even support that.\n\n2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:38.520\n So in 2000, so we released Anaconda,\n\n2:15:38.520 --> 2:15:39.960\n which was just a distribution of libraries,\n\n2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:42.480\n but we started to work on Conda in 2012.\n\n2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:44.680\n First version of Conda came out in early 2013,\n\n2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:47.840\n summer of 2013, and it was a package manager.\n\n2:15:47.840 --> 2:15:49.560\n So you could say, Conda install scikit learn.\n\n2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:54.280\n In fact, scikit learn was a fantastic project that emerged.\n\n2:15:54.280 --> 2:15:57.120\n It was the classic example of the scikits.\n\n2:15:57.120 --> 2:15:59.760\n I talked to you earlier about SciPy being too big\n\n2:15:59.760 --> 2:16:01.240\n to be a single library.\n\n2:16:01.240 --> 2:16:02.680\n Well, what the community had done is said,\n\n2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:04.160\n let's make scikits.\n\n2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:05.840\n And there's scikit image, there's scikit learn,\n\n2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:07.640\n there's a lot of scikits.\n\n2:16:07.640 --> 2:16:10.200\n And it was a fantastic move that the community did.\n\n2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:11.460\n I didn't do it.\n\n2:16:11.460 --> 2:16:12.560\n I was like, okay, that's a good idea.\n\n2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:13.540\n I didn't like the name.\n\n2:16:13.540 --> 2:16:15.500\n I didn't like the fact you typed scikit image.\n\n2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:17.400\n I was like, that's gotta be simpler.\n\n2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:19.800\n That's scikit learn, we gotta make that smaller.\n\n2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:21.940\n I don't like typing all this stuff from imports.\n\n2:16:21.940 --> 2:16:23.220\n So I was kind of a pressure that way,\n\n2:16:23.220 --> 2:16:25.280\n but I love the energy and love the fact\n\n2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:26.200\n that they went out and they did it,\n\n2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:29.400\n and DOS people, Jared Millman, and then of course, Gael,\n\n2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:31.280\n and there's people I'm not even naming.\n\n2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:34.640\n Scikit learn really emerged as a fantastic project.\n\n2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:36.680\n And the documentation around that is also incredible.\n\n2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:37.840\n And the documentation was incredible, exactly.\n\n2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:40.160\n I don't know who did that, but they did a great job.\n\n2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:44.040\n A lot of people in Inria, a lot of European contributors.\n\n2:16:45.120 --> 2:16:47.120\n There's some Andreas in the US.\n\n2:16:47.120 --> 2:16:48.920\n There's a lot of just people I just adore,\n\n2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:50.320\n I think are amazing people.\n\n2:16:51.180 --> 2:16:52.480\n Awesome use of SciPy, right?\n\n2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:54.600\n I love the fact that they were using SciPy effectively\n\n2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:57.160\n to do something I love, which is machine learning,\n\n2:16:57.160 --> 2:16:58.980\n but couldn't install it.\n\n2:16:58.980 --> 2:17:00.600\n Because there's so many pieces involved.\n\n2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:02.160\n So many dependencies, right?\n\n2:17:02.160 --> 2:17:06.080\n So our use case of Conda was Conda install scikit learn.\n\n2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:09.440\n Right, and it was the best way to install scikit learn\n\n2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:14.440\n in 2013 to really 2018, 17, 18, PIP finally caught up.\n\n2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:16.440\n I still think it's you should Conda install scikit learn\n\n2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:17.560\n for the PIP install scikit learn,\n\n2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:19.360\n but you can PIP install scikit learn.\n\n2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:21.840\n The issue is the package they created was wheels\n\n2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:24.480\n and PIP does not handle the multi vendor approach.\n\n2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:26.600\n They don't handle the fact you have C++ libraries\n\n2:17:26.600 --> 2:17:27.680\n you're depending on.\n\n2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:29.240\n They just stop at the Python boundary.\n\n2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:31.280\n And so what you have to do in the wheel world\n\n2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:33.200\n is you have to vendor.\n\n2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:35.640\n You have to take all of the binary and vendor it.\n\n2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:38.480\n Now, if your change happens in underlying dependency,\n\n2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:40.280\n you have to redo the whole wheel.\n\n2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:42.080\n So TensorFlow, as you know,\n\n2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:44.680\n you should not PIP install TensorFlow.\n\n2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:45.520\n It's a terrible idea.\n\n2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:48.640\n People do it because the popularity of PIP,\n\n2:17:48.640 --> 2:17:49.480\n many people think, oh, of course,\n\n2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:51.480\n that's how I install everything in Python.\n\n2:17:51.480 --> 2:17:53.960\n Yeah, this is one of the big challenges.\n\n2:17:53.960 --> 2:17:57.920\n You take a GitHub repository or just a basic blog post.\n\n2:17:57.920 --> 2:18:00.840\n The number of time PIP is mentioned over Conda\n\n2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:02.760\n is like 100 X to one.\n\n2:18:02.760 --> 2:18:03.600\n Correct, correct.\n\n2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:04.440\n So it just has to do with the.\n\n2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:05.280\n And that was increasing.\n\n2:18:05.280 --> 2:18:07.520\n It wasn't true early because PIP didn't exist.\n\n2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:08.840\n Like Conda came first.\n\n2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:10.160\n So but that's the problem.\n\n2:18:10.160 --> 2:18:13.040\n Like Conda came first, but that's like the long tail\n\n2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:15.840\n of the internet documentation user generated.\n\n2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:19.160\n So that like you think, how do I install Google?\n\n2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:20.400\n How do I install TensorFlow?\n\n2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:23.000\n You're just not gonna see Conda in that first page.\n\n2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:24.120\n Correct, exactly.\n\n2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:24.960\n And that.\n\n2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:29.400\n Not today, you would have in 2016, 2017.\n\n2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:32.760\n And it's sad because Conda solves\n\n2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:34.160\n a lot of usability issues.\n\n2:18:34.160 --> 2:18:35.000\n Correct.\n\n2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:36.480\n Like for especially super challenging thing.\n\n2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:37.320\n I don't know.\n\n2:18:37.320 --> 2:18:39.520\n One of the big pain points for me was\n\n2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:43.560\n just on the computer vision side, OpenCV installation.\n\n2:18:43.560 --> 2:18:44.400\n Perfect example.\n\n2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:45.240\n Yes.\n\n2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:47.400\n I think Conda, I don't know if Conda solved that one.\n\n2:18:47.400 --> 2:18:49.080\n Conda has an OpenCV package.\n\n2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:49.920\n I don't know.\n\n2:18:49.920 --> 2:18:53.440\n I certainly know PIP has not solved.\n\n2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:55.840\n I mean, there's complexities there because.\n\n2:18:55.840 --> 2:18:56.680\n Right.\n\n2:18:56.680 --> 2:18:57.640\n I actually don't know.\n\n2:18:57.640 --> 2:18:59.120\n I should probably know a good answer for this,\n\n2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:04.120\n but if you compile OpenCV with certain dependencies,\n\n2:19:05.440 --> 2:19:07.440\n you'll be able to do certain things.\n\n2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:09.840\n So there's this kind of flexibility of what you,\n\n2:19:09.840 --> 2:19:12.960\n like what options you compile with.\n\n2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:13.800\n Yes.\n\n2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:17.840\n And I don't think it's trivial to do that with Conda or.\n\n2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:20.520\n So Conda has a notion of variance of a package.\n\n2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:23.120\n You can actually have different compilation versions\n\n2:19:23.120 --> 2:19:23.960\n of a package.\n\n2:19:23.960 --> 2:19:24.800\n So not just the version is different,\n\n2:19:24.800 --> 2:19:26.880\n but oh, this is compiled with these optimizations on.\n\n2:19:26.880 --> 2:19:28.000\n So Conda does have an answer.\n\n2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:28.840\n Has those flavors.\n\n2:19:28.840 --> 2:19:30.080\n Has flavors, basically.\n\n2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:32.360\n Well, PIP, as far as I know, does not have flavors.\n\n2:19:32.360 --> 2:19:33.280\n No, no.\n\n2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:36.440\n PIP generally hasn't thought deeply\n\n2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:38.400\n about the binary dependency problem, right?\n\n2:19:38.400 --> 2:19:41.840\n And that's why fundamentally it doesn't work\n\n2:19:41.840 --> 2:19:43.640\n for the SciPy ecosystem.\n\n2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:46.120\n It barely, you can sort of paper over it and duct tape\n\n2:19:46.120 --> 2:19:48.040\n and it kind of works until it doesn't\n\n2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:49.560\n and it falls apart entirely.\n\n2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:51.520\n So it's been a mixed bag.\n\n2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:54.360\n Like, and I've been having lots of conversations\n\n2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:56.120\n with people over the years because again,\n\n2:19:56.120 --> 2:19:58.400\n it's an area where if you understand some things,\n\n2:19:58.400 --> 2:19:59.240\n but not all the things,\n\n2:19:59.240 --> 2:20:02.200\n but they've done a great job of community appeal.\n\n2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:05.560\n This is an area where I think Anaconda as a company\n\n2:20:05.560 --> 2:20:07.040\n needed to do some things\n\n2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:10.440\n in order to make Conda more community centric, right?\n\n2:20:10.440 --> 2:20:13.080\n And this is a, I talk about this all the time.\n\n2:20:13.080 --> 2:20:16.640\n There's a balance between you have every project starts\n\n2:20:16.640 --> 2:20:18.280\n with what I called company backed open source.\n\n2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:20.320\n Even if the company is yourself, it's just one person,\n\n2:20:20.320 --> 2:20:23.360\n just doing business as.\n\n2:20:23.360 --> 2:20:26.080\n But ultimately for products to succeed virally\n\n2:20:26.080 --> 2:20:28.320\n and become massive influencers,\n\n2:20:28.320 --> 2:20:29.160\n they have to create,\n\n2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:30.520\n they have to get community people on board.\n\n2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:32.120\n They have to get other people on board.\n\n2:20:32.120 --> 2:20:33.680\n So it has to become community driven.\n\n2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:35.520\n And a big part of that is engagement with those people.\n\n2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:38.600\n Empowering people, governance around it.\n\n2:20:38.600 --> 2:20:41.360\n And what happened with Conda in the early days,\n\n2:20:41.360 --> 2:20:43.720\n PIP emerged and we did do some good things.\n\n2:20:43.720 --> 2:20:46.400\n Conda Forge, Conda Forge community\n\n2:20:46.400 --> 2:20:49.880\n is sort of the community recipe creation community.\n\n2:20:49.880 --> 2:20:52.160\n But Conda itself, I still believe,\n\n2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:55.120\n and Peter is CEO of Anaconda, he's my co founder.\n\n2:20:55.120 --> 2:20:58.160\n I ran Anaconda until 2017, 2018.\n\n2:20:58.160 --> 2:20:59.000\n Is Peter still Anaconda?\n\n2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:00.000\n Peter's still Anaconda, right?\n\n2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:01.360\n And we're still great friends.\n\n2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:02.560\n We talk all the time.\n\n2:21:02.560 --> 2:21:03.600\n I love him to death.\n\n2:21:03.600 --> 2:21:06.080\n There's a long story there about like why and how\n\n2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:08.640\n and we can cover in some other podcast perhaps.\n\n2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:09.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:11.400\n It's sort of a more, maybe a more business focused one.\n\n2:21:11.400 --> 2:21:15.160\n But this is one area where I think Conda\n\n2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:17.280\n should be more community driven.\n\n2:21:17.280 --> 2:21:18.960\n Like he should be pushing more\n\n2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:21.200\n to get more community contributors to Conda\n\n2:21:21.200 --> 2:21:26.080\n and let the, Anaconda shouldn't be fighting this battle.\n\n2:21:26.080 --> 2:21:26.920\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:27.760\n Right?\n\n2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:28.600\n It's actually, it's really a developers.\n\n2:21:28.600 --> 2:21:30.400\n Like you said, like help the developers\n\n2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:32.200\n and then they'll actually move us the right direction.\n\n2:21:32.200 --> 2:21:34.040\n Well, that was the problem I have is many\n\n2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:36.520\n of the cool kids I know don't use Conda.\n\n2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:38.880\n And that to me is confusing.\n\n2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:39.800\n It is confusing.\n\n2:21:39.800 --> 2:21:42.640\n It's really a matter of, Conda has some challenges.\n\n2:21:42.640 --> 2:21:44.120\n First of all, Conda still needs to be improved.\n\n2:21:44.120 --> 2:21:45.320\n There's lots of improvements to be made.\n\n2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:47.600\n And it's that aspect of wait, who's doing this?\n\n2:21:47.600 --> 2:21:50.960\n And the fact that then the Pi PA really stepped up.\n\n2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:53.400\n Like they were not solving the problem at all.\n\n2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:55.640\n And now they kind of got to where they're solving it\n\n2:21:55.640 --> 2:21:56.720\n for the most part.\n\n2:21:56.720 --> 2:21:58.160\n And then effectively you could get,\n\n2:21:58.160 --> 2:22:00.360\n like Conda solved a problem that was there.\n\n2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:01.200\n And it still does.\n\n2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:03.960\n It's still, you know, there's still great things it can do.\n\n2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:06.920\n But, and we still use it all the time at one site\n\n2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:08.960\n and with other clients, but with,\n\n2:22:08.960 --> 2:22:12.160\n but you can kind of do similar things with PIP and Docker.\n\n2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:13.000\n Right?\n\n2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:15.280\n So especially with the web development community,\n\n2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:17.080\n that part of it, again, is this is the,\n\n2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:19.200\n there's a lot of different kinds of developers\n\n2:22:19.200 --> 2:22:20.200\n in the Python ecosystem.\n\n2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:23.720\n And there's still a lack of some clear understanding.\n\n2:22:23.720 --> 2:22:25.320\n I go to the Python conference all the time\n\n2:22:25.320 --> 2:22:28.280\n and then there's only a few people in the Pi PA who get it.\n\n2:22:28.280 --> 2:22:30.680\n And then others who are just massively trumpeting\n\n2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:32.840\n the power of PIP, but just do not understand the problem.\n\n2:22:32.840 --> 2:22:33.680\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:36.040\n So one of the obvious things to me from a mom,\n\n2:22:36.040 --> 2:22:37.840\n from a non programmer perspective,\n\n2:22:37.840 --> 2:22:41.760\n is the across operating system usability.\n\n2:22:41.760 --> 2:22:42.680\n That's much more natural.\n\n2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:45.440\n So there's people that use Windows and just,\n\n2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:49.080\n it seems much easier to recommend Conda there,\n\n2:22:49.080 --> 2:22:51.840\n but then it, you should also recommend it across the board.\n\n2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:53.520\n So I'll definitely sort of.\n\n2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:55.320\n But what I recommend now is a hybrid.\n\n2:22:55.320 --> 2:22:56.160\n I do.\n\n2:22:56.160 --> 2:22:57.000\n I mean, I have no problem.\n\n2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:57.840\n Is it possible to use?\n\n2:22:57.840 --> 2:22:58.660\n Oh, it is.\n\n2:22:58.660 --> 2:22:59.500\n It is.\n\n2:22:59.500 --> 2:23:01.600\n But like build the environment with PIP, with Conda,\n\n2:23:01.600 --> 2:23:03.360\n build an environment with Conda\n\n2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:04.600\n and then PIP install on top of that.\n\n2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:05.440\n That's fine.\n\n2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:09.400\n Be careful about PIP installing OpenCV or TensorFlow\n\n2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:11.360\n or because if somebody's allowed that,\n\n2:23:11.360 --> 2:23:13.320\n it's gonna be most surely done in a way\n\n2:23:13.320 --> 2:23:15.120\n that can't be updated that easily.\n\n2:23:15.120 --> 2:23:17.680\n So install like the big packages,\n\n2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:21.000\n the infrastructure with Conda and then the weirdos.\n\n2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:21.840\n Yeah.\n\n2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:24.720\n That like the weird like implementation for some.\n\n2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:28.440\n I had a, there's a cool library I used\n\n2:23:28.440 --> 2:23:33.440\n that based on your location and time of day and date\n\n2:23:33.520 --> 2:23:35.640\n tells you the exact position of the sun\n\n2:23:35.640 --> 2:23:38.160\n relative to the earth.\n\n2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:39.700\n And it's just like a simple library,\n\n2:23:39.700 --> 2:23:41.360\n but it's very precise.\n\n2:23:41.360 --> 2:23:42.200\n And I was like, all right.\n\n2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:45.120\n But that was, that was, and it's like PIP.\n\n2:23:45.120 --> 2:23:48.600\n Well, the thing they did really well is Python developers\n\n2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:50.600\n who wanna get their stuff published,\n\n2:23:50.600 --> 2:23:51.920\n you have to have a PIP recipe.\n\n2:23:51.920 --> 2:23:52.760\n Yeah.\n\n2:23:52.760 --> 2:23:53.600\n Right?\n\n2:23:53.600 --> 2:23:56.440\n I mean, even if it's, you know, the challenge is,\n\n2:23:56.440 --> 2:23:58.800\n and there's a key thing that needs to be added to PIP,\n\n2:23:58.800 --> 2:24:01.680\n just simply add to PIP the ability to defer\n\n2:24:01.680 --> 2:24:03.440\n to a system package manager.\n\n2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:04.460\n Like, cause it's, you know,\n\n2:24:04.460 --> 2:24:07.280\n recognize you're not gonna solve all the dependency problem.\n\n2:24:07.280 --> 2:24:12.280\n So let like give up and allow the system package to work.\n\n2:24:12.420 --> 2:24:15.140\n That way Anaconda is installed and it has PIP.\n\n2:24:15.140 --> 2:24:16.960\n It would default to Conda to install stuff,\n\n2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:19.240\n but Red Hat RPM would default to RPM\n\n2:24:19.240 --> 2:24:20.600\n to install some more things.\n\n2:24:20.600 --> 2:24:23.480\n Like that's the, that's a key, not difficult,\n\n2:24:23.480 --> 2:24:25.960\n but somewhat work, some work feature needs to be added.\n\n2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:27.440\n That's an example of something like,\n\n2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:28.620\n I've known we need to do it.\n\n2:24:28.620 --> 2:24:30.920\n I mean, it's where I wish I had more money.\n\n2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:33.480\n I wish I was more successful in the business side,\n\n2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:35.060\n trying to get there, but I wish my, you know,\n\n2:24:35.060 --> 2:24:37.280\n my family, friends and full community that I know.\n\n2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:38.120\n Was larger.\n\n2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:39.320\n Was larger and had more money.\n\n2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:42.680\n Cause I know tons of things to do effectively\n\n2:24:42.680 --> 2:24:46.280\n with more resources, but you know,\n\n2:24:46.280 --> 2:24:48.720\n I have not yet been successful at channel.\n\n2:24:48.720 --> 2:24:49.960\n Tons of, you know, some, you know,\n\n2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:51.480\n I'm happy with what we've done.\n\n2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:54.840\n We created again at Quansight,\n\n2:24:54.840 --> 2:24:56.480\n what we created to get Anaconda started.\n\n2:24:56.480 --> 2:24:58.160\n We created community to get Anaconda started.\n\n2:24:58.160 --> 2:24:59.280\n Done it again with Quansight.\n\n2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:00.480\n Super excited by that.\n\n2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:02.200\n But it took three years to do it.\n\n2:25:02.200 --> 2:25:03.200\n What is Quansight?\n\n2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:04.440\n What is its mission?\n\n2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:06.920\n We've talked a few times about different fascinating\n\n2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:08.920\n aspects of it, but let's like big picture,\n\n2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:09.760\n what is Quansight?\n\n2:25:09.760 --> 2:25:10.600\n Big picture Quansight.\n\n2:25:10.600 --> 2:25:13.480\n Quansight is, its mission is to connect data\n\n2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:14.480\n to an open economy.\n\n2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:17.520\n So it's basically consulting of the pie data ecosystem,\n\n2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:18.360\n right?\n\n2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:19.280\n It's a consulting company.\n\n2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:21.200\n And what I've said when I started it was we're trying\n\n2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:24.700\n to create products, people, and technology.\n\n2:25:24.700 --> 2:25:26.700\n So it's divided into two groups.\n\n2:25:26.700 --> 2:25:28.300\n And a third one as well.\n\n2:25:28.300 --> 2:25:30.360\n The two groups are a consulting services company\n\n2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:31.960\n that just helps people do data science\n\n2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:35.080\n and data engineering and data management better\n\n2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:35.920\n and more efficiently.\n\n2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:36.760\n Like full stack, like full thing.\n\n2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:38.200\n Full stack data science, full thing.\n\n2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:40.020\n We'll help you build a infrastructure.\n\n2:25:40.020 --> 2:25:41.380\n If you're using Jupiter, we need,\n\n2:25:41.380 --> 2:25:43.820\n we do staff augmentation, need more pro programmers,\n\n2:25:43.820 --> 2:25:44.900\n help you use Dask more effectively,\n\n2:25:44.900 --> 2:25:46.520\n help you use GPUs more effectively.\n\n2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:48.400\n Just basically a lot of people need help.\n\n2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:50.800\n So we do training as well to help people, you know,\n\n2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:55.000\n both immediate help and then get, learn from somebody.\n\n2:25:55.860 --> 2:25:57.080\n We've added a bunch of stuff too.\n\n2:25:57.080 --> 2:25:58.600\n We've kind of separated some of these other things\n\n2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:00.120\n into another company called Open Teams\n\n2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:01.760\n that we currently started.\n\n2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:03.380\n One of the things I loved about what we did at Anaconda\n\n2:26:03.380 --> 2:26:05.520\n was creating a community innovation team.\n\n2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:06.700\n And so I wanted to replicate that.\n\n2:26:06.700 --> 2:26:09.360\n This time we did a lot of innovation at Anaconda.\n\n2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:10.600\n I wanted to do innovation,\n\n2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:13.680\n but also contribute to the projects that existed,\n\n2:26:13.680 --> 2:26:16.440\n like create a place where maintainers,\n\n2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:18.480\n so the SciPy and NumPy and Numba\n\n2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:20.400\n and all these projects we already started\n\n2:26:20.400 --> 2:26:22.700\n can pay people to work on them and keep them going.\n\n2:26:22.700 --> 2:26:23.540\n So that's Labs.\n\n2:26:23.540 --> 2:26:25.960\n Quansight Labs is a separate organization.\n\n2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:28.060\n It's a nonprofit mission.\n\n2:26:28.060 --> 2:26:29.940\n The profits of Quansight help fund it.\n\n2:26:29.940 --> 2:26:33.240\n And in fact, every project that we have at Quansight,\n\n2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:36.040\n a portion of the money goes directly to Quansight Labs\n\n2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:37.060\n to help keep it funded.\n\n2:26:37.060 --> 2:26:38.280\n So we've gotten several mechanisms\n\n2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:40.040\n that we keep Quansight Labs funded.\n\n2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:41.960\n And currently, so I'm really excited about Labs\n\n2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:43.680\n because it's been a mission for a long time.\n\n2:26:43.680 --> 2:26:45.240\n What kind of projects are within Labs?\n\n2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:47.680\n So Labs is working to make the software better,\n\n2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:49.760\n like make NumPy better, make SciPy better.\n\n2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:52.340\n It only works on open source.\n\n2:26:52.340 --> 2:26:55.440\n So if somebody wants to, so companies do,\n\n2:26:55.440 --> 2:26:57.480\n we have a thing called a community work order, we call it.\n\n2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:00.020\n If a company says, I wanna make Spyder better.\n\n2:27:00.020 --> 2:27:01.680\n Okay, cool.\n\n2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:05.440\n You can pay for a month of a developer of Spyder\n\n2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:08.400\n or a developer of NumPy or a developer of SciPy.\n\n2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:09.840\n You can't tell them what you want them to do.\n\n2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:12.800\n You can give them your priorities and things you wish existed\n\n2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:16.080\n and they'll work on those priorities with the community\n\n2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:17.560\n to get what the community wants\n\n2:27:17.560 --> 2:27:18.880\n and what emerges of what the community wants.\n\n2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:21.080\n Is there some aspect on the consulting side\n\n2:27:21.080 --> 2:27:24.320\n that is helping, as we were talking about morphology\n\n2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:26.600\n and so on, is there specific application\n\n2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:29.120\n that are particularly like driving,\n\n2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:32.000\n sort of inspiring the need for updates to SciPy?\n\n2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:33.360\n Correct, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:34.840\n GPUs are absolutely one of them.\n\n2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:36.840\n And new hardware beyond GPUs.\n\n2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:39.720\n I mean, Tesla's Dojo chip, I'm hoping we'll have a chance\n\n2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:41.080\n to work on that perhaps.\n\n2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:43.840\n Things like that are definitely driving it.\n\n2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:45.520\n The other thing that's driving it is scalable,\n\n2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:47.640\n like speed and scale.\n\n2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:50.360\n How do I write NumPy code or NumPy Lite code\n\n2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:52.520\n if I want it to run across a cluster?\n\n2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:54.240\n That's Dask or maybe it's Ray.\n\n2:27:54.240 --> 2:27:56.360\n I mean, there's sort of ways to do that now.\n\n2:27:56.360 --> 2:27:59.720\n Or there's Moden and there's, so Pandas code,\n\n2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:02.080\n NumPy code, SciPy code, Scikit learn code\n\n2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:03.240\n that I want to scale.\n\n2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:04.880\n So that's one big area.\n\n2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:08.400\n Have you gotten a chance to chat with Andre and Elon\n\n2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:09.840\n about particular, because like.\n\n2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:11.360\n No, I would love to, by the way.\n\n2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:12.280\n I have not, but I'd love to.\n\n2:28:12.280 --> 2:28:15.520\n I just saw their Tesla AI Days video.\n\n2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:16.360\n Super excited.\n\n2:28:16.360 --> 2:28:18.600\n That's one of the, you know, I love great engineering,\n\n2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:21.000\n software engineering teams and engineering teams in general.\n\n2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.040\n And they're doing a lot of incredible stuff with Python.\n\n2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:25.040\n They're like revolutionary.\n\n2:28:25.040 --> 2:28:28.800\n So many aspects of the machine learning pipeline.\n\n2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:29.640\n I agree.\n\n2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:30.600\n That's operating in the real world.\n\n2:28:30.600 --> 2:28:31.880\n And so much of that is Python.\n\n2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:35.000\n Like you said, the guy running, you know, Andre Kapathy,\n\n2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:38.680\n running Autopilot is tweeting about optimization\n\n2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:41.200\n of NumPy versus.\n\n2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:42.920\n I would love to talk to him.\n\n2:28:42.920 --> 2:28:45.080\n In fact, we have at Quonset, we've been fortunate enough\n\n2:28:45.080 --> 2:28:47.560\n to work with Facebook on PyTorch directly.\n\n2:28:47.560 --> 2:28:49.880\n So we have about 13 developers at Quonset.\n\n2:28:49.880 --> 2:28:52.560\n Some of them are in labs working directly on PyTorch.\n\n2:28:52.560 --> 2:28:53.400\n On PyTorch.\n\n2:28:53.400 --> 2:28:54.240\n On PyTorch, right.\n\n2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:55.680\n So I basically started Quonset.\n\n2:28:55.680 --> 2:28:57.160\n I went to both TensorFlow and PyTorch and said,\n\n2:28:57.160 --> 2:29:00.200\n hey, I want to help connect what you're doing\n\n2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:01.920\n to the broader SciPy ecosystem.\n\n2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:03.240\n Because I see what you're doing.\n\n2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:04.760\n We have this bigger mission that we want to make sure\n\n2:29:04.760 --> 2:29:06.760\n we don't, you know, lose energy here.\n\n2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:09.840\n So, and Facebook responded really positively\n\n2:29:09.840 --> 2:29:12.400\n and I didn't get the same reaction.\n\n2:29:12.400 --> 2:29:13.560\n Not yet, not yet.\n\n2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:14.400\n Not yet.\n\n2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:17.480\n So I really love the folks at TensorFlow, too.\n\n2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:18.480\n They're fantastic.\n\n2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:21.120\n I think it's the, just how it integrates\n\n2:29:21.120 --> 2:29:21.960\n with their business.\n\n2:29:21.960 --> 2:29:23.800\n I mean, like I said, there's a lot of reasons.\n\n2:29:23.800 --> 2:29:25.720\n Just the timing, the integration with their business,\n\n2:29:25.720 --> 2:29:27.160\n what they're looking for.\n\n2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:28.760\n They're probably looking for more users.\n\n2:29:28.760 --> 2:29:31.600\n And I was looking to kind of cut up some development effort\n\n2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:33.840\n and they couldn't receive that as easily, I think.\n\n2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:36.040\n So I'm hoping, I'm really hopeful\n\n2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:37.640\n and love the people there.\n\n2:29:37.640 --> 2:29:39.800\n What's the idea behind OpenTeams?\n\n2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:41.960\n So OpenTeams, I'm super excited about OpenTeams\n\n2:29:41.960 --> 2:29:43.400\n because it's one of the,\n\n2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:46.760\n I mentioned my idea for investing directly in open source.\n\n2:29:46.760 --> 2:29:48.880\n So that's a concept called fair OSS.\n\n2:29:48.880 --> 2:29:51.000\n But one of the things we, when we started Quansight,\n\n2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:53.680\n we knew we would do is we develop products and ideas\n\n2:29:53.680 --> 2:29:55.440\n and new companies might come out.\n\n2:29:55.440 --> 2:29:57.680\n At Anaconda, this was clear, right?\n\n2:29:57.680 --> 2:30:00.240\n Anaconda, we did so much innovation\n\n2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:02.960\n that like five or six companies could have come out of that.\n\n2:30:02.960 --> 2:30:05.000\n And we just didn't structure it so they could.\n\n2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:07.240\n But in fact, they have, you look at Dask,\n\n2:30:07.240 --> 2:30:08.880\n there's two companies going out of Dask.\n\n2:30:08.880 --> 2:30:10.080\n You know, Bokeh could be a company.\n\n2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:11.720\n There's like lots of companies that could exist\n\n2:30:11.720 --> 2:30:13.120\n off the work we did there.\n\n2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:16.400\n And so I thought, oh, here's a recipe for an incubation,\n\n2:30:16.400 --> 2:30:19.480\n a concept that we could actually spawn new companies\n\n2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:20.800\n and new innovations.\n\n2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:22.800\n And then the idea has always been,\n\n2:30:22.800 --> 2:30:24.680\n well, money they earn should come back\n\n2:30:24.680 --> 2:30:26.520\n to fund the open source projects.\n\n2:30:26.520 --> 2:30:29.240\n So labs is, you know, I think there should be\n\n2:30:29.240 --> 2:30:30.720\n a lot of things like Quansight Labs.\n\n2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:32.560\n I think this concept is one that scales.\n\n2:30:32.560 --> 2:30:35.080\n You could have a lot of open source research labs.\n\n2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:37.480\n Along the way, so in 2018, when the bigger idea came,\n\n2:30:37.480 --> 2:30:38.800\n how to make open source investable, I said,\n\n2:30:38.800 --> 2:30:41.120\n oh, I need to write, I need to create a venture fund.\n\n2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:43.840\n So we created a venture fund called Quansight Initiate\n\n2:30:43.840 --> 2:30:44.680\n at the same time.\n\n2:30:44.680 --> 2:30:45.520\n It's an angel fund, really.\n\n2:30:45.520 --> 2:30:47.840\n It's, you know, we started to learn that process.\n\n2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:48.680\n How do we actually do this?\n\n2:30:48.680 --> 2:30:49.520\n How do we get LPs?\n\n2:30:49.520 --> 2:30:52.480\n How do we actually go in this direction and build a fund?\n\n2:30:52.480 --> 2:30:54.280\n And I'm like, every venture fund should have\n\n2:30:54.280 --> 2:30:55.720\n an associated open source research lab,\n\n2:30:55.720 --> 2:30:56.560\n which is no reason.\n\n2:30:56.560 --> 2:30:59.520\n Like our venture fund, the carried interest,\n\n2:30:59.520 --> 2:31:01.840\n a portion of it goes to the lab.\n\n2:31:01.840 --> 2:31:03.280\n It directly will fund the lab.\n\n2:31:03.280 --> 2:31:04.120\n That's fascinating, brother.\n\n2:31:04.120 --> 2:31:06.800\n So you use the power of the organic formation of teams\n\n2:31:06.800 --> 2:31:10.680\n in the open source community, and then like naturally,\n\n2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:13.920\n that leads to a business that can make money.\n\n2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:14.760\n Yeah, correct.\n\n2:31:14.760 --> 2:31:16.680\n And then it always maintains and loops back\n\n2:31:16.680 --> 2:31:17.520\n to the open source.\n\n2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:18.440\n Loops back to open source, exactly.\n\n2:31:18.440 --> 2:31:19.640\n I mean, to me, it's a natural fit.\n\n2:31:19.640 --> 2:31:20.960\n There's something, there's absolutely\n\n2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:23.640\n a repeatable pattern there, and it's also beneficial\n\n2:31:23.640 --> 2:31:26.800\n because, oh, I have, I have natural connections\n\n2:31:26.800 --> 2:31:29.200\n to the open source if I have an open source research lab.\n\n2:31:29.200 --> 2:31:31.160\n Like, they'll always, they'll be out there\n\n2:31:31.160 --> 2:31:34.280\n talking to people, and so we've had a chance\n\n2:31:34.280 --> 2:31:35.920\n to talk to a lot of early stage companies.\n\n2:31:35.920 --> 2:31:37.880\n And we, and our fund focuses on the early stage.\n\n2:31:37.880 --> 2:31:41.880\n So Quansight has the services, the lab, the fund, right?\n\n2:31:41.880 --> 2:31:44.200\n In that process, a lot of stuff started to happen.\n\n2:31:44.200 --> 2:31:46.320\n They're like, oh, you know, we started to do recruiting\n\n2:31:46.320 --> 2:31:48.600\n and support and training, and I was starting\n\n2:31:48.600 --> 2:31:50.960\n to build a bigger sales team and marketing team\n\n2:31:50.960 --> 2:31:52.880\n and people besides just developers.\n\n2:31:52.880 --> 2:31:54.080\n And one of the challenges with that\n\n2:31:54.080 --> 2:31:55.960\n is you end up with different cultural aspects.\n\n2:31:55.960 --> 2:31:58.800\n You know, developers, you know, there's a,\n\n2:31:58.800 --> 2:32:00.760\n in any company you go to, you kind of go look,\n\n2:32:00.760 --> 2:32:03.080\n is this a business led company, a developer led company?\n\n2:32:03.080 --> 2:32:04.280\n Do they kind of coexist?\n\n2:32:04.280 --> 2:32:06.120\n Are they, what's the interface between them?\n\n2:32:06.120 --> 2:32:07.280\n There's always a bit of a tension there.\n\n2:32:07.280 --> 2:32:08.760\n Like we were talking about before.\n\n2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:10.200\n You know, what is the tension there?\n\n2:32:10.200 --> 2:32:11.360\n With OpenTeams, I thought, wait a minute,\n\n2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:13.160\n we can actually just create,\n\n2:32:13.160 --> 2:32:15.560\n like this concept of Quansight plus labs,\n\n2:32:15.560 --> 2:32:18.480\n it's, well, it's specific to the Pi data ecosystem.\n\n2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:20.800\n The concept is general for all open source.\n\n2:32:20.800 --> 2:32:22.640\n So OpenTeams emerged as a, oh,\n\n2:32:22.640 --> 2:32:24.400\n we can create a business development company\n\n2:32:24.400 --> 2:32:28.440\n for many, many Quansights, like thousands of Quansights.\n\n2:32:28.440 --> 2:32:30.840\n And it can be a marketplace to connect,\n\n2:32:30.840 --> 2:32:33.440\n essentially be the enterprise software company\n\n2:32:33.440 --> 2:32:34.440\n of the future.\n\n2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:36.760\n If you look at what enterprise software wants\n\n2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:38.640\n from the customer side, and during this journey,\n\n2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:42.360\n I've had the chance to work and sell to lots of companies,\n\n2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:45.240\n Exxon and Shell and Davey Morgan Bank of America,\n\n2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:46.680\n like the Fortune 100,\n\n2:32:46.680 --> 2:32:48.240\n and talk to a lot of people in procurement\n\n2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:50.400\n and see what are they buying and why are they buying?\n\n2:32:50.400 --> 2:32:51.760\n So, you know, I don't know everything,\n\n2:32:51.760 --> 2:32:52.720\n but I've learned a lot about,\n\n2:32:52.720 --> 2:32:54.480\n oh, what are they really looking for?\n\n2:32:54.480 --> 2:32:56.400\n And they're looking for solutions.\n\n2:32:56.400 --> 2:32:58.160\n They're constantly given products\n\n2:32:58.160 --> 2:33:01.160\n from enterprise software.\n\n2:33:01.160 --> 2:33:02.560\n Here's open source, leave the enterprise software,\n\n2:33:02.560 --> 2:33:03.400\n now I buy it.\n\n2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:05.880\n And then they have to stitch it together into a solution.\n\n2:33:05.880 --> 2:33:07.360\n Open source is fantastic for gluing\n\n2:33:07.360 --> 2:33:08.760\n those solutions together.\n\n2:33:08.760 --> 2:33:11.480\n So, whereas they keep getting new platforms\n\n2:33:11.480 --> 2:33:12.360\n they're trying to buy,\n\n2:33:12.360 --> 2:33:15.000\n but most open source, what most enterprises want\n\n2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:16.800\n is tools that they can customize\n\n2:33:16.800 --> 2:33:18.920\n that are as inexpensive as they can.\n\n2:33:18.920 --> 2:33:20.400\n Yeah, and so you always want to maintain\n\n2:33:20.400 --> 2:33:21.560\n the connection to the open source\n\n2:33:21.560 --> 2:33:22.400\n because that's going to be the tools.\n\n2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:24.840\n Yes, so open teams is about solving\n\n2:33:24.840 --> 2:33:26.720\n enterprise software problems.\n\n2:33:26.720 --> 2:33:28.120\n Brilliant, brilliant idea, by the way.\n\n2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:30.960\n With a connect, but we do it honoring the topology.\n\n2:33:30.960 --> 2:33:32.360\n We don't hire all the people.\n\n2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:35.120\n We are a network connecting the sales energy\n\n2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:36.520\n and the procurement energy,\n\n2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:37.960\n and we work on the business side,\n\n2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:39.080\n get the deals closed,\n\n2:33:39.080 --> 2:33:40.560\n and then have a network of partners\n\n2:33:40.560 --> 2:33:44.080\n like Quonsight and others who we hand the deals to,\n\n2:33:44.080 --> 2:33:44.920\n to actually do the work.\n\n2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:46.480\n And then we have to maintain,\n\n2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:47.320\n I feel like we have to maintain\n\n2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:48.760\n some level of quality control\n\n2:33:48.760 --> 2:33:50.960\n so that the client can rely on open teams\n\n2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:52.080\n to ensure the delivery.\n\n2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:54.640\n It's not just, here's a lead, go figure that out.\n\n2:33:54.640 --> 2:33:57.040\n But no, we're going to make sure you get what you need.\n\n2:33:57.040 --> 2:33:58.840\n By the way, it's such a skill,\n\n2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:00.640\n and I don't know if I have the patience.\n\n2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:04.080\n I will have the patience to talk to the business people\n\n2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:05.600\n or more specific, I mean,\n\n2:34:05.600 --> 2:34:07.480\n there's all kinds of flavors of business people\n\n2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:10.520\n or like marketing people.\n\n2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:12.800\n There's a challenge.\n\n2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:13.640\n I hear what you're saying\n\n2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:14.880\n because I've had the same challenge.\n\n2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:15.720\n And it's true.\n\n2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:18.440\n There's sometimes you think, okay, this is way overwrought.\n\n2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:20.240\n Yeah, but you have to become an adult\n\n2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:22.320\n and you have to, because the companies have needs.\n\n2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:24.320\n They have ways to make money\n\n2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:26.480\n and they also want to learn and grow,\n\n2:34:26.480 --> 2:34:28.960\n and it's your job to kind of educate them on the best way,\n\n2:34:28.960 --> 2:34:31.000\n like the value of open source, for example.\n\n2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:32.960\n Right, and I'm really grateful for all my experiences\n\n2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:35.720\n over the past 14 years, understanding that side of it\n\n2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:37.160\n and still learning for sure,\n\n2:34:37.160 --> 2:34:38.640\n but not just understanding from companies,\n\n2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:40.560\n but also dealing with marketing professionals\n\n2:34:40.560 --> 2:34:41.600\n and sales professionals\n\n2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:43.120\n and people that make a career out of that\n\n2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:44.360\n and understanding what they're thinking about\n\n2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:46.840\n and also understanding, well, let's make this better.\n\n2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:48.160\n We can really make a place.\n\n2:34:48.160 --> 2:34:50.480\n Open teams I see as the transmission layer\n\n2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:53.720\n between companies and open source communities\n\n2:34:53.720 --> 2:34:55.600\n producing enterprise software solutions.\n\n2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:56.880\n Eventually we want to,\n\n2:34:56.880 --> 2:34:59.320\n today we're taking on SaaS and MATLAB\n\n2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:01.720\n and tools that we know we can replace for folks.\n\n2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:04.560\n Really, anytime you have a software tool at an organization\n\n2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:06.200\n where you have to do a lot of customization\n\n2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:07.360\n to make it work for you.\n\n2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:09.000\n It's not you're just buying this thing off the shelf\n\n2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:09.840\n and it works.\n\n2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:11.080\n It's like, okay, you buy this system\n\n2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:12.840\n and then you customize it a lot,\n\n2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:15.280\n usually with expensive consultants\n\n2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:17.200\n to actually make it work for you.\n\n2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:19.760\n All of those should be replaced by open source foundations\n\n2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:20.600\n with the same customization.\n\n2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:22.360\n You're doing such important work,\n\n2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:25.440\n such important work in these giant organizations\n\n2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:26.520\n that do exactly that,\n\n2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:28.360\n taking some proprietary software\n\n2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:30.520\n and hiring a huge team of consultants\n\n2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:32.760\n that customize it and then that whole thing\n\n2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:33.680\n gets outdated quick.\n\n2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:34.520\n Correct.\n\n2:35:34.520 --> 2:35:36.760\n And so, I mean, that's brilliant.\n\n2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:39.360\n So the one solution to that\n\n2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:43.240\n is kind of what Tesla's doing a little bit of,\n\n2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:46.680\n which is basically build up a software engineering team.\n\n2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:48.320\n Like build a team from scratch.\n\n2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:49.160\n Build a team from scratch.\n\n2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:50.000\n And companies are doing it well,\n\n2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:50.840\n that's what they're doing right now.\n\n2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:51.680\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:35:51.680 --> 2:35:52.520\n And that's okay.\n\n2:35:52.520 --> 2:35:54.360\n And you're creating a topology for some of that.\n\n2:35:54.360 --> 2:35:55.200\n You're right.\n\n2:35:55.200 --> 2:35:56.040\n You just don't have to do it.\n\n2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:57.040\n That's not the only answer, right?\n\n2:35:57.040 --> 2:35:58.880\n And so other companies can access this,\n\n2:35:58.880 --> 2:35:59.880\n be more accessible.\n\n2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:01.120\n We literally say,\n\n2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:03.920\n open team is the future of enterprise software.\n\n2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:04.760\n We're still early.\n\n2:36:04.760 --> 2:36:07.400\n Like this idea just percolated over the past year\n\n2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:08.520\n as we've kind of grown Quansight\n\n2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:10.440\n and realized the extensibility of it.\n\n2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:12.240\n We just finished in our seed round\n\n2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:15.160\n to help get more sales people\n\n2:36:15.160 --> 2:36:17.640\n and then push the messaging correctly.\n\n2:36:17.640 --> 2:36:19.160\n And there's lots of tools we're building\n\n2:36:19.160 --> 2:36:20.000\n to make this easier.\n\n2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:21.720\n Like we wanna automate the processes.\n\n2:36:21.720 --> 2:36:23.560\n We feel like a lot of the power\n\n2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:25.600\n is the efficiency of the sales process.\n\n2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:29.400\n There's a lot of wasted energy in small teams\n\n2:36:29.400 --> 2:36:31.640\n and the sales energy to get into large companies\n\n2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:32.680\n and make a deal.\n\n2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:34.720\n There's a lot of money spent on that process.\n\n2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:36.560\n Creating the tools and processes for that sales.\n\n2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:38.160\n So make that super seamless.\n\n2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:39.680\n So a single company can go,\n\n2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:41.400\n oh, I've got my contract with open teams.\n\n2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:43.040\n We've got a subscription they can get.\n\n2:36:43.040 --> 2:36:45.200\n They can make that procurement seamless.\n\n2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:46.720\n And then the fact they have access\n\n2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:48.840\n to the entire open source ecosystem.\n\n2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:51.240\n And we have a part of our work\n\n2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:53.400\n that's embracing open source ecosystems\n\n2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:55.080\n and making sure we're doing things useful for them\n\n2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:56.160\n or serving them.\n\n2:36:56.160 --> 2:36:57.560\n And then companies making sure\n\n2:36:57.560 --> 2:36:59.200\n they're getting solutions they care about.\n\n2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:02.480\n And then figuring out which targets we have.\n\n2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:04.720\n We're not taking on all of open source,\n\n2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:06.040\n all of enterprise software yet.\n\n2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:07.440\n But we're step by step.\n\n2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:08.520\n Well this feels like the future.\n\n2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:10.600\n The idea and the vision is brilliant.\n\n2:37:10.600 --> 2:37:14.440\n Can I ask you, why do you think Microsoft bought GitHub\n\n2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:16.560\n and what do you think is the future of GitHub?\n\n2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:17.400\n Great point.\n\n2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:18.220\n I thought it was a brilliant move.\n\n2:37:18.220 --> 2:37:20.620\n I think they did because Microsoft has always\n\n2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:22.660\n had a developer centric culture.\n\n2:37:22.660 --> 2:37:23.500\n Like they always have.\n\n2:37:23.500 --> 2:37:25.160\n Like one of the things Microsoft's always done well\n\n2:37:25.160 --> 2:37:27.440\n is understand that their power is the developers.\n\n2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:31.600\n It's been, Ballmer didn't necessarily make a good meme\n\n2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:32.560\n about how he approached that.\n\n2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:34.520\n But they're broadening that.\n\n2:37:34.520 --> 2:37:35.360\n I think that's why.\n\n2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:38.080\n Because they recognize GitHub is where developers are at.\n\n2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:38.920\n Right?\n\n2:37:38.920 --> 2:37:39.740\n And so.\n\n2:37:39.740 --> 2:37:41.080\n But do they have a vision like open teams\n\n2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:41.920\n type of situation, right?\n\n2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:43.600\n I don't think so yet.\n\n2:37:43.600 --> 2:37:46.680\n Are they just basically throwing money at developers\n\n2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:47.960\n to show their support?\n\n2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:48.800\n I think so.\n\n2:37:48.800 --> 2:37:50.840\n Without a topology like you put it.\n\n2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:53.280\n Like a way to leverage that.\n\n2:37:53.280 --> 2:37:55.480\n Like to give developers actual money.\n\n2:37:55.480 --> 2:37:56.320\n Right.\n\n2:37:56.320 --> 2:37:57.160\n I don't think so.\n\n2:37:57.160 --> 2:37:59.440\n They're still, it's an enterprise software company.\n\n2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:00.520\n And they make a bunch of money.\n\n2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:01.360\n They make a bunch of games.\n\n2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:02.640\n They're a big company.\n\n2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:03.760\n They sell products.\n\n2:38:03.760 --> 2:38:06.080\n I think part of it is they know there's opportunity\n\n2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:07.760\n to make money from GitHub.\n\n2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:08.600\n Right?\n\n2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:09.440\n There's definitely a business there.\n\n2:38:09.440 --> 2:38:11.340\n You know, to sell to developers.\n\n2:38:11.340 --> 2:38:13.280\n Or to sell to people using development.\n\n2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:14.240\n I think there's part of that.\n\n2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:15.880\n I think part of it is also there's,\n\n2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:18.080\n they had definitely wanted to recognize\n\n2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:20.560\n that you need to value open source\n\n2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:21.920\n to get great developers.\n\n2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:24.000\n Which is an important concept that was emerging\n\n2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:25.000\n over the past 10 years.\n\n2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:28.000\n That, you know, pay at Pi Data.\n\n2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:29.880\n We were able to convince J.P. Morgan\n\n2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:31.480\n to support Pi Data because of that fact.\n\n2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:32.320\n Right?\n\n2:38:32.320 --> 2:38:33.440\n That was where the money for them putting\n\n2:38:33.440 --> 2:38:35.160\n a couple hundred thousand into supporting Pi Data\n\n2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:37.800\n for several conferences was they want developers.\n\n2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:39.480\n And they realized that developers want\n\n2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:40.720\n to participate in open source.\n\n2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:43.200\n So enterprise software folks don't always understand\n\n2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:44.600\n how their software gets used.\n\n2:38:44.600 --> 2:38:46.560\n Having spent a lot of time on the floors\n\n2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:49.600\n at J.P. Morgan, at InShell, at ExxonMobil,\n\n2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:52.880\n you see, oh, these companies have large development teams.\n\n2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:55.280\n And then they're kind of dealing with\n\n2:38:55.280 --> 2:38:56.720\n what's being delivered to them.\n\n2:38:56.720 --> 2:38:58.360\n So I really feel kind of a privilege\n\n2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:00.480\n that I had a chance to learn some of these people\n\n2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:01.800\n and see what they're doing.\n\n2:39:01.800 --> 2:39:04.000\n And even work alongside them, you know,\n\n2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:07.640\n as a consultant, using open source and trying to figure,\n\n2:39:07.640 --> 2:39:09.960\n how do we make this work inside of our large organization?\n\n2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:13.000\n Some of it is actually, for a large organization,\n\n2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:14.800\n some of it is messaging to the world\n\n2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:16.280\n that you care about developers\n\n2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:18.840\n and you're the cool, you care.\n\n2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:21.040\n Like, for example, like if Ford,\n\n2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:23.880\n cause I talked to them, like car companies, right?\n\n2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:26.680\n They want to attract, you know,\n\n2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:28.760\n you want to take on Tesla and autopilot.\n\n2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:29.960\n You want to take on, right?\n\n2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:31.720\n And so what do you do there?\n\n2:39:31.720 --> 2:39:32.960\n You show that you're cool.\n\n2:39:32.960 --> 2:39:36.480\n Like you try to show off that you care about developers\n\n2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:39.040\n and they have a lot of trouble doing that.\n\n2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:42.720\n And like one way, I think like Ford should have bought GitHub.\n\n2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:46.880\n They just to show off, like these old school companies\n\n2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:49.960\n and it's in a lot of different industries.\n\n2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:51.080\n There's probably different ways.\n\n2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:54.080\n It's probably an art show that you care to developers.\n\n2:39:54.080 --> 2:39:57.920\n And the developers, it's exactly what you, like,\n\n2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:00.520\n for example, just spit balling here,\n\n2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:02.520\n but like Ford or somebody like that\n\n2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:05.960\n could give a hundred million dollars\n\n2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:07.880\n to the development of NumPy.\n\n2:40:07.880 --> 2:40:12.880\n And like literally look at like the top most popular projects\n\n2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:17.080\n in Python and just say, we're just going to give money.\n\n2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:20.240\n Like that's going to immediately make you cool.\n\n2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:21.600\n They could actually, yeah.\n\n2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:24.400\n And in fact, they set up NumFocus to make it easy.\n\n2:40:24.400 --> 2:40:26.080\n But the challenge was,\n\n2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:28.480\n is also you have to have some business development.\n\n2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:31.280\n Like it's a bit of a seeding problem, right?\n\n2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:32.120\n And you look at how,\n\n2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:33.400\n I've talked to the folks at Linux Foundation,\n\n2:40:33.400 --> 2:40:34.360\n know how they're doing it.\n\n2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:36.600\n I know how, and starting NumFocus,\n\n2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:39.400\n because we had two babies in 2012.\n\n2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:41.120\n One was Anaconda, one was NumFocus, right?\n\n2:40:41.120 --> 2:40:42.760\n And they were both important efforts.\n\n2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:44.000\n They had distinct journeys\n\n2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:46.200\n and super grateful that both existed\n\n2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:47.760\n and still grateful both exist.\n\n2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:51.840\n But there's different energies in getting donations\n\n2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:55.320\n as there is getting, this is important to my business.\n\n2:40:55.320 --> 2:40:58.680\n Like I'm selling you something that this is a,\n\n2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:00.280\n I'm going to make money this way.\n\n2:41:00.280 --> 2:41:01.120\n Like if you can tie it,\n\n2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:04.040\n if you can tie the message to an ROI for the company,\n\n2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:04.880\n it becomes a brainer.\n\n2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:05.720\n That's more effective.\n\n2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:06.920\n It's much more effective, right?\n\n2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:09.520\n So, and there are rational arguments to make.\n\n2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:11.120\n I've tried to have conversations with marketing,\n\n2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:12.240\n especially marketing departments.\n\n2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:14.840\n Like very early on, it was clear to me that,\n\n2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:18.160\n oh, you could just take a fraction of your marketing budget\n\n2:41:18.160 --> 2:41:20.240\n and just spend it on open source development.\n\n2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:23.760\n And you get better results from your marketing.\n\n2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:24.600\n Like, because.\n\n2:41:24.600 --> 2:41:26.000\n How did those, can I, sorry,\n\n2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:27.920\n I'm going to try not to go and rants here.\n\n2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:29.800\n What have you learned from the interaction\n\n2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:31.440\n with the marketing folks on that kind of,\n\n2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:34.160\n because you gave a great example\n\n2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:37.240\n of something that will obviously be much better investment\n\n2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:40.360\n in terms of marketing is supporting open source projects.\n\n2:41:40.360 --> 2:41:41.840\n The challenge is not dissimilar\n\n2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:44.480\n from the challenge you have in academia\n\n2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:46.520\n or the different colleges, right?\n\n2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:50.000\n Knowledge gets very specific and very channeled, right?\n\n2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:51.160\n And so people get,\n\n2:41:51.160 --> 2:41:53.920\n they get a lot of learning in the thing they know about.\n\n2:41:53.920 --> 2:41:56.200\n And it's hard then to bridge that\n\n2:41:56.200 --> 2:41:58.160\n and to get them to think differently enough\n\n2:41:58.160 --> 2:42:02.160\n to have a sense that you might have something to offer\n\n2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:03.000\n because it's different.\n\n2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:04.280\n It's like, well, how do I implement that?\n\n2:42:04.280 --> 2:42:05.840\n How do I, what do I do with that?\n\n2:42:05.840 --> 2:42:07.840\n Like, do I, which budget do I take from?\n\n2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:10.320\n Do I slow down my spend on Google ads\n\n2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:11.600\n or my spend on Facebook ads?\n\n2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:14.640\n Or do I not hire a content creator and say like,\n\n2:42:14.640 --> 2:42:16.160\n there's an operational aspect to that,\n\n2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:19.080\n that you have to be the CMO, right?\n\n2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:21.000\n Or the CEO, you have to get the right level.\n\n2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:24.360\n So you'll have to hire at a high position level\n\n2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:25.720\n where they care about this and this.\n\n2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:27.640\n Right, or they won't know how, right?\n\n2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:30.440\n And because you can also do it very clumsily, right?\n\n2:42:30.440 --> 2:42:32.040\n And I've seen it, cause you can,\n\n2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:33.760\n you absolutely have to honor and recognize\n\n2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:36.640\n the people you're going to and the fact\n\n2:42:36.640 --> 2:42:37.800\n that if you just throw money at them,\n\n2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:39.240\n it could actually create more problems.\n\n2:42:39.240 --> 2:42:41.320\n Can I just say, this is not you saying, can I just,\n\n2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:44.360\n cause I just need, I need to say this.\n\n2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:49.360\n I've been very surprised how often marketing people\n\n2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:51.760\n are terrible at marketing.\n\n2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:55.600\n I feel like the best marketing is doing something novel\n\n2:42:55.600 --> 2:42:58.240\n and unique that anticipates the future.\n\n2:42:58.240 --> 2:43:01.520\n It feels like so much of the marketing practice\n\n2:43:01.520 --> 2:43:04.320\n is like what they took in school,\n\n2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:06.680\n or maybe they're studying for what was the best thing\n\n2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:08.440\n that was done in the past decade,\n\n2:43:08.440 --> 2:43:10.800\n and they're just repeating that over and over,\n\n2:43:10.800 --> 2:43:13.760\n as opposed to innovating, like taking the risk.\n\n2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:14.600\n To me, marketing.\n\n2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:15.440\n That's a great point.\n\n2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:17.080\n Is taking the big risk.\n\n2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:17.920\n That's a great point.\n\n2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:18.800\n And being the first one to risk.\n\n2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:21.200\n Yeah, there's an aspect of data observation\n\n2:43:21.200 --> 2:43:22.160\n from that risk, right?\n\n2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:25.120\n That's, I think, shared what they're doing already.\n\n2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:27.680\n But it absolutely, it's about, I think it's content.\n\n2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:30.200\n Like there's this whole world on content marketing\n\n2:43:30.200 --> 2:43:33.560\n that you could almost say, well, yeah, it can get over,\n\n2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:35.080\n you can get inundated with stuff\n\n2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:36.400\n that's not relevant to you.\n\n2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:39.160\n Whereas what you're saying would be highly relevant\n\n2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:41.560\n and highly useful and highly beneficial.\n\n2:43:41.560 --> 2:43:42.960\n Yeah, but it's risk.\n\n2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:44.600\n I mean, that's why I sort of,\n\n2:43:44.600 --> 2:43:46.240\n there's a lot of innovative ways of doing that.\n\n2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:48.000\n Tesla's an example of people\n\n2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:49.960\n that basically don't do marketing.\n\n2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:52.800\n They do marketing in a very, like,\n\n2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:55.720\n let's say Elon hired a person who's just good at Twitter\n\n2:43:55.720 --> 2:43:57.520\n for running Tesla's Twitter account.\n\n2:43:57.520 --> 2:43:59.120\n No, right, right.\n\n2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:00.840\n I mean, that's exactly what you wanna be doing.\n\n2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:03.120\n You want it to be constantly innovating in the.\n\n2:44:03.120 --> 2:44:04.280\n Right, there's an aspect of telling.\n\n2:44:04.280 --> 2:44:06.920\n I mean, I've definitely seen people doing great work\n\n2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:08.400\n where you're not talking about it.\n\n2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:09.560\n Like, I would say that's actually a problem\n\n2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:11.360\n I have right now with Quonset Labs.\n\n2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:12.720\n Quonset Labs has been doing amazing work,\n\n2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:13.560\n really excited about it,\n\n2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:15.480\n but we have not been talking about it enough.\n\n2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:16.320\n We haven't been.\n\n2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:17.880\n And there's different ways to talk about it.\n\n2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:18.720\n There's different ways to,\n\n2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:20.800\n there's different channels to which to communicate.\n\n2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:25.600\n There's also, like, I'll just throw some shade\n\n2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:26.920\n at companies I love.\n\n2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:29.160\n So for example, iRobot,\n\n2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:30.800\n I just had a conversation with them.\n\n2:44:30.800 --> 2:44:31.840\n They make Roombas.\n\n2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:32.680\n Sure.\n\n2:44:32.680 --> 2:44:35.440\n And I think I love, they're incredible robots,\n\n2:44:35.440 --> 2:44:38.960\n but like every time they do like advertisement,\n\n2:44:38.960 --> 2:44:41.880\n not advertisement, but like marketing type stuff,\n\n2:44:41.880 --> 2:44:44.080\n it just looks so corporate.\n\n2:44:44.080 --> 2:44:47.640\n And to me, the incredible,\n\n2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:50.280\n maybe wrong in the case of iRobot, I don't know.\n\n2:44:50.280 --> 2:44:54.000\n But to me, when you're talking about engineering systems,\n\n2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:57.000\n it's really nice to show off the magic of the engineering\n\n2:44:57.000 --> 2:45:02.000\n and the software and all the geniuses behind this product\n\n2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:05.080\n and the tinkering and like the raw authenticity\n\n2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:06.800\n of what it takes to build that system\n\n2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:09.960\n versus the marketing people who want to have like\n\n2:45:09.960 --> 2:45:12.120\n pretty people, like standing there all pretty\n\n2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:14.600\n with the robots, like moving perfectly.\n\n2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:16.520\n So to me, there's some aspect,\n\n2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:18.040\n it's like speaking to the hackers,\n\n2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:21.040\n you have to throw some bones,\n\n2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:25.560\n some care towards the engineers, the developers,\n\n2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:28.720\n because there's some aspect, one, for the hiring,\n\n2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:31.000\n but two, there's an authenticity to that,\n\n2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:33.080\n authenticity to that kind of communication\n\n2:45:33.080 --> 2:45:36.080\n that's really inspiring to the end user as well.\n\n2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:38.440\n Like if they know that brilliant people,\n\n2:45:38.440 --> 2:45:40.680\n the best in the world are working at your company,\n\n2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:42.640\n they start to believe that that product\n\n2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:43.960\n that you're creating is really good.\n\n2:45:43.960 --> 2:45:45.640\n It's interesting, because your initial reaction would be,\n\n2:45:45.640 --> 2:45:46.760\n wait, there's different users here.\n\n2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:48.400\n Why would you do that to, you know,\n\n2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:52.120\n my wife bought a Roomba, and she loves developers,\n\n2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:56.560\n she loves me, but she doesn't care about that culture.\n\n2:45:56.560 --> 2:45:59.600\n So essentially what you said is actually the authenticity,\n\n2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:01.160\n because everyone has a friend, everyone knows people,\n\n2:46:01.160 --> 2:46:02.680\n there's word of mouth, I mean, if you.\n\n2:46:02.680 --> 2:46:04.160\n Word of mouth is so, so proper.\n\n2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:05.640\n Yeah, exactly, that's interesting.\n\n2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:07.560\n Because I think it's the lack of that realization,\n\n2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:09.840\n there's this halo effect that influences\n\n2:46:09.840 --> 2:46:11.720\n your general marketing, interesting.\n\n2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:14.640\n For some stupid reason, I do have a platform,\n\n2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:16.920\n and it seems that the reason I have a platform,\n\n2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:19.480\n many others like me, millions of others,\n\n2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:21.160\n is like the authenticity,\n\n2:46:21.160 --> 2:46:23.960\n and like we get excited naturally about stuff.\n\n2:46:23.960 --> 2:46:25.760\n And like, I don't want to get excited\n\n2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:27.800\n about that iRobot video,\n\n2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:30.760\n because it's boring, it's marketing, it's corporate,\n\n2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:33.600\n as opposed to, I wanted to do some fun,\n\n2:46:33.600 --> 2:46:36.240\n this is me, like a shout out to iRobot,\n\n2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:39.360\n is they're not letting me get into the robot.\n\n2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:40.920\n Yeah, well there's an aspect of,\n\n2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:44.840\n that could be benefiting from a culture of modularity,\n\n2:46:44.840 --> 2:46:47.840\n like add ons, and that could actually dramatically help.\n\n2:46:47.840 --> 2:46:49.300\n You've seen that over history,\n\n2:46:49.300 --> 2:46:51.160\n I mean, Apple is an example of a company like that,\n\n2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:54.400\n or the, like, I can see what your point is,\n\n2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:56.920\n is that you have something that needs to be,\n\n2:46:56.920 --> 2:46:58.240\n it needs to be adopted broadly,\n\n2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:00.040\n the concept needs to be adopted broadly.\n\n2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:01.640\n And if you want to go beyond this one device,\n\n2:47:01.640 --> 2:47:04.220\n you need to engage this community.\n\n2:47:04.220 --> 2:47:07.560\n Yeah, and connecting to the open source that you said.\n\n2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:08.580\n I gotta ask you,\n\n2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:11.800\n you're a programmer,\n\n2:47:11.800 --> 2:47:14.840\n one of the most impactful programmers ever.\n\n2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:18.560\n You've led many programmers, you lead many programmers.\n\n2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:21.180\n What are some, from a programmer perspective,\n\n2:47:21.180 --> 2:47:23.360\n what makes a good programmer?\n\n2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:25.000\n What makes a productive programmer?\n\n2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:27.140\n Is there a device you can give\n\n2:47:27.140 --> 2:47:28.480\n to be a great programmer in this world?\n\n2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:30.280\n That's a great, great question.\n\n2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:31.640\n And there are times in my life\n\n2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:32.920\n I'd probably answer this even better\n\n2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:35.040\n than I hope maybe give an answer today.\n\n2:47:35.040 --> 2:47:36.700\n Because I thought about this numerous times,\n\n2:47:36.700 --> 2:47:38.280\n like right now I've spent on so much time\n\n2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:40.040\n recently hiring salespeople that,\n\n2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:43.440\n That your mind is a little bit on something else.\n\n2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:44.280\n On something else.\n\n2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:46.080\n But I reflected on the past,\n\n2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:48.160\n and also, you know, I have some really,\n\n2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:49.000\n the only way I can do this,\n\n2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:51.440\n is I have some really great programmers that I work with,\n\n2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:53.240\n who lead the teams that they lead.\n\n2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:56.600\n And my goal is to inspire them and hopefully help them,\n\n2:47:56.600 --> 2:47:57.800\n encourage them, and be,\n\n2:47:57.800 --> 2:47:59.620\n help them encourage with their teams.\n\n2:47:59.620 --> 2:48:01.200\n I would say there's a number of things, couple things.\n\n2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:03.860\n One is curiosity.\n\n2:48:03.860 --> 2:48:07.700\n Like you, I think a programmer without curiosity\n\n2:48:07.700 --> 2:48:09.600\n is mundane.\n\n2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:12.240\n Like you'll lose interest, you won't do your best work.\n\n2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:13.640\n So it's sort of, it's an affect.\n\n2:48:13.640 --> 2:48:14.480\n It's sort of, are you,\n\n2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:16.800\n you have some curiosity about things.\n\n2:48:16.800 --> 2:48:19.600\n I think two, don't try to do everything at once.\n\n2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:21.960\n Recognize that you're, you know, we're limited as humans.\n\n2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:23.200\n You're limited as a human.\n\n2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:24.920\n And each one of us are limited in different ways.\n\n2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:26.600\n You know, we all have our different strengths and skills.\n\n2:48:26.600 --> 2:48:29.880\n So it's adapting the art of programming to your skills.\n\n2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:31.240\n One of the things that always works,\n\n2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:33.580\n is to limit what you're trying to solve.\n\n2:48:33.580 --> 2:48:36.640\n Right, so, if you're part of a team,\n\n2:48:36.640 --> 2:48:38.920\n usually maybe somebody else has put the architecture together\n\n2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:41.720\n and they've gotten given a portion for you if you're young.\n\n2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:43.440\n If you're not part of a team,\n\n2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:46.640\n it's sort of breaking down the problem into smaller parts,\n\n2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:48.620\n is essential for you to make progress.\n\n2:48:48.620 --> 2:48:50.720\n It's very easy to take on a big project\n\n2:48:50.720 --> 2:48:52.800\n and try to do it all at once, and you get lost.\n\n2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:53.680\n And then you do it badly.\n\n2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:57.700\n And so thinking about, you know,\n\n2:48:57.700 --> 2:48:59.400\n very concretely what you're doing,\n\n2:48:59.400 --> 2:49:01.440\n defining the inputs and outputs,\n\n2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:03.960\n defining what you want to get done.\n\n2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:07.280\n Even just talking about that and like writing down\n\n2:49:07.280 --> 2:49:09.440\n before you write code, just what are you trying to accomplish?\n\n2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:12.800\n I mean, very specific about it, really, really helps.\n\n2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:17.000\n I think using other people's work, right?\n\n2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:20.000\n Don't be afraid that somehow you're,\n\n2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:21.280\n like you should do it all.\n\n2:49:21.280 --> 2:49:23.240\n Like, nobody does.\n\n2:49:23.240 --> 2:49:25.240\n Stand on the shoulders of giants.\n\n2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:26.720\n And copy and paste from Stack Overflow.\n\n2:49:26.720 --> 2:49:28.200\n Copy and paste from Stack Overflow.\n\n2:49:28.200 --> 2:49:30.040\n But don't just copy and paste,\n\n2:49:30.040 --> 2:49:31.760\n this is particularly relevant in the era of Codex\n\n2:49:31.760 --> 2:49:34.960\n and the auto generated code, which is essentially,\n\n2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:36.760\n I see as an indexing of Stack Overflow.\n\n2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:37.600\n Right, exactly.\n\n2:49:37.600 --> 2:49:38.440\n Secondly, it's like.\n\n2:49:38.440 --> 2:49:39.280\n It's a search engine.\n\n2:49:39.280 --> 2:49:41.280\n It's a search engine over Stack Overflow, basically.\n\n2:49:41.280 --> 2:49:43.480\n So it's not, I mean, we've had this for a while.\n\n2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:47.300\n But really, you want to cut and paste, but not blindly.\n\n2:49:47.300 --> 2:49:51.000\n Like, absolutely I've cut and paste to understand,\n\n2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:52.320\n but then you understand.\n\n2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:53.640\n Oh, this is what this means.\n\n2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:54.920\n Oh, this is what it's doing.\n\n2:49:54.920 --> 2:49:56.680\n And understand as much as you can.\n\n2:49:56.680 --> 2:49:59.080\n So it's critical, that's where the curiosity comes in.\n\n2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:01.000\n If you're just blindly cutting and pasting,\n\n2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:02.240\n you're not gonna understand.\n\n2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:07.240\n So understand, and then be sensitive to hype cycles.\n\n2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:10.920\n Right, every few often there's always a,\n\n2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:12.520\n oh, test driven development is the answer.\n\n2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:13.800\n Oh, object oriented is the answer.\n\n2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:16.520\n Oh, there's always an answer.\n\n2:50:16.520 --> 2:50:18.400\n Agile is the answer.\n\n2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:20.840\n Be cautious of jumping onto a hype cycle.\n\n2:50:20.840 --> 2:50:22.520\n Like, likely there's signal.\n\n2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:23.440\n Like, there's a thing there\n\n2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:25.320\n that's actually valuable, you can learn from.\n\n2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:27.720\n But it's almost certainly not the answer\n\n2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:28.960\n to everything you need.\n\n2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:30.160\n What lessons do you draw\n\n2:50:30.160 --> 2:50:34.100\n from you having created NumPy and SciPy?\n\n2:50:34.100 --> 2:50:37.200\n Like, in service of sort of answering the question\n\n2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:38.840\n of what it takes to be a great programmer\n\n2:50:38.840 --> 2:50:40.520\n and giving advice to people.\n\n2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:42.960\n How can you be the next person to create a SciPy?\n\n2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:44.820\n Yeah, so one is listen.\n\n2:50:45.640 --> 2:50:46.480\n To?\n\n2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:47.300\n Listen.\n\n2:50:47.300 --> 2:50:48.140\n To who?\n\n2:50:48.140 --> 2:50:51.440\n To people that have a problem, right?\n\n2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:52.520\n Which is everybody, right?\n\n2:50:52.520 --> 2:50:54.960\n But listen, and listen to many.\n\n2:50:54.960 --> 2:50:57.460\n And then try to, and then do.\n\n2:50:57.460 --> 2:50:59.760\n Like, you're gonna have to do an experiment, you know?\n\n2:50:59.760 --> 2:51:01.940\n Do, fall down, don't be afraid to fall down.\n\n2:51:01.940 --> 2:51:04.240\n Don't be afraid, the first thing you do\n\n2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:07.600\n is probably gonna suck, and that's okay, right?\n\n2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:11.240\n It's honestly, I think iteration is the key to innovation.\n\n2:51:11.240 --> 2:51:16.240\n And it's almost that psychological hesitation we have\n\n2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:18.520\n to just iterate.\n\n2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:20.560\n Like, yeah, we know it's not great,\n\n2:51:20.560 --> 2:51:22.000\n but next time it'll be better.\n\n2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:25.560\n I mean, just keep learning and keep improving.\n\n2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:27.700\n So it's an attitude.\n\n2:51:27.700 --> 2:51:32.160\n And then it doesn't take intense concentration, right?\n\n2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:34.560\n Good things don't happen just,\n\n2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:38.200\n it's not quite like TikTok or like Facebook, you know?\n\n2:51:38.200 --> 2:51:40.520\n You can't scroll your way to good programming, right?\n\n2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:44.720\n There are sincere hours of deep,\n\n2:51:44.720 --> 2:51:46.040\n don't be afraid of the deep problem.\n\n2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:47.680\n Like, often people will run away from something\n\n2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:49.000\n because, oh, I can't solve this.\n\n2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:51.360\n And you might be right, but give it an hour.\n\n2:51:51.360 --> 2:51:53.360\n Give it a couple of hours and see.\n\n2:51:53.360 --> 2:51:56.560\n And just five minutes, not gonna give you that.\n\n2:51:56.560 --> 2:52:00.520\n Was it lonely when you were building SciPy and NumPy?\n\n2:52:00.520 --> 2:52:02.520\n Hugely, yeah, absolutely lonely,\n\n2:52:02.520 --> 2:52:05.760\n in the sense of you had to have an inner drive,\n\n2:52:05.760 --> 2:52:08.000\n and that inner drive for me always comes from,\n\n2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:11.640\n I have to see that this is right in some angle.\n\n2:52:11.640 --> 2:52:13.360\n I have to believe it, that this is the right approach,\n\n2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:14.720\n the right thing to do.\n\n2:52:14.720 --> 2:52:16.400\n With SciPy, it was like, oh yeah,\n\n2:52:16.400 --> 2:52:19.080\n the world needs libraries and Python.\n\n2:52:19.080 --> 2:52:20.720\n Clearly Python's popular enough\n\n2:52:20.720 --> 2:52:22.960\n with enough influential people to start,\n\n2:52:22.960 --> 2:52:24.640\n and it needs more libraries.\n\n2:52:24.640 --> 2:52:26.600\n So that is a good in and of itself.\n\n2:52:26.600 --> 2:52:28.360\n So I'm gonna go do that good.\n\n2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:30.360\n So find a good, find a thing that you know is good\n\n2:52:30.360 --> 2:52:32.160\n and just work on it.\n\n2:52:33.040 --> 2:52:34.720\n So that has to happen, and it is.\n\n2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:37.000\n And you kind of have to have enough realization\n\n2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:40.280\n of your mission to be okay with the naysayer\n\n2:52:40.280 --> 2:52:42.200\n or the fact that not everybody joins you at front.\n\n2:52:42.200 --> 2:52:43.480\n In fact, one thing I've talked to people a lot,\n\n2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:45.480\n I've seen a lot of projects come, and some fail.\n\n2:52:45.480 --> 2:52:47.600\n Not everything I've done has actually worked perfectly.\n\n2:52:47.600 --> 2:52:49.160\n I've tried a bunch of stuff that, okay,\n\n2:52:49.160 --> 2:52:51.920\n that didn't really work, or this isn't working, and why.\n\n2:52:51.920 --> 2:52:55.800\n But you see the patterns, and one of the key things is\n\n2:52:55.800 --> 2:52:59.040\n you can't even know for six months.\n\n2:52:59.040 --> 2:53:00.200\n I say 18 months right now.\n\n2:53:00.200 --> 2:53:01.800\n If you're starting a new project,\n\n2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:03.200\n you gotta give it a good 18 month run\n\n2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:05.920\n before you even know if the feedback's there.\n\n2:53:05.920 --> 2:53:07.880\n You're not gonna know in six months.\n\n2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:08.720\n You might have the perfect thing,\n\n2:53:08.720 --> 2:53:11.480\n but six months from now, it's still kind of still emerging.\n\n2:53:11.480 --> 2:53:13.360\n So give it time, because you're dealing with humans,\n\n2:53:13.360 --> 2:53:15.960\n and humans have an inertial energy\n\n2:53:15.960 --> 2:53:18.680\n that just doesn't change that quickly, so.\n\n2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:23.560\n Let me ask a silly question, but like you said,\n\n2:53:23.560 --> 2:53:26.120\n you're focused on the sales side of things currently,\n\n2:53:26.120 --> 2:53:28.960\n but back when you were actively programming,\n\n2:53:28.960 --> 2:53:31.680\n maybe in the 90s, you talked about IDEs.\n\n2:53:31.680 --> 2:53:36.200\n What's a setup that you have that brings you joy?\n\n2:53:36.200 --> 2:53:39.640\n Keyboard, number of screens, Linux.\n\n2:53:39.640 --> 2:53:40.920\n I do still like to program some.\n\n2:53:40.920 --> 2:53:42.160\n It's not as much as I used to.\n\n2:53:42.160 --> 2:53:44.560\n I have two projects I'm super interested in,\n\n2:53:44.560 --> 2:53:45.640\n trying to find funding for them,\n\n2:53:45.640 --> 2:53:47.200\n trying to figure out teams for them,\n\n2:53:47.200 --> 2:53:49.040\n but I could talk about those.\n\n2:53:49.040 --> 2:53:51.960\n But what I, yeah, I'm an Emacs guy.\n\n2:53:51.960 --> 2:53:56.080\n Great, thank the superior editor, everybody.\n\n2:53:56.080 --> 2:53:59.000\n I've got, I don't often delete tweets,\n\n2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:00.600\n but one of the tweets I deleted\n\n2:54:00.600 --> 2:54:02.840\n when I said Emacs was better than Vim,\n\n2:54:02.840 --> 2:54:04.520\n and then the hate I got from it.\n\n2:54:04.520 --> 2:54:05.360\n It is.\n\n2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:07.640\n I was like, I'm walking away from this.\n\n2:54:07.640 --> 2:54:09.160\n I do too, I don't push it.\n\n2:54:09.160 --> 2:54:10.000\n I mean, I'm not.\n\n2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:11.080\n I'm just joking, of course.\n\n2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:12.160\n Yeah, exactly, it's kind of like,\n\n2:54:12.160 --> 2:54:14.520\n but people do take the editor seriously, right?\n\n2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:15.360\n I did it as a joke.\n\n2:54:15.360 --> 2:54:16.200\n That's your life.\n\n2:54:16.200 --> 2:54:20.760\n It is, but there's something beautiful to me about Emacs,\n\n2:54:20.760 --> 2:54:22.360\n but for people that love Vim,\n\n2:54:22.360 --> 2:54:23.200\n there's something beautiful to them about that.\n\n2:54:23.200 --> 2:54:24.040\n There is.\n\n2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:26.280\n I mean, I do use Vim for quick editing.\n\n2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:27.880\n Like Command Line, if I said quick editing,\n\n2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:30.280\n I will still sometimes use it, but not much.\n\n2:54:30.280 --> 2:54:32.760\n Like it's simple, corrective signal editor character.\n\n2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:34.920\n So when you were developing SciPy, you were using Emacs?\n\n2:54:34.920 --> 2:54:35.880\n Emacs, yeah.\n\n2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:39.040\n SciPy and NumPy are all written on Emacs on a Linux box.\n\n2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:43.160\n And CVS and then SVN, version control.\n\n2:54:43.160 --> 2:54:44.040\n Git came later.\n\n2:54:44.040 --> 2:54:48.080\n Like Git has, I love distributed branch stuff.\n\n2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:51.640\n I think Git is pretty complicated, but I love the concept.\n\n2:54:51.640 --> 2:54:55.240\n And also, of course, GitHub and then GitLab\n\n2:54:55.240 --> 2:54:59.440\n make Git definitely consumable, but that came later.\n\n2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:00.880\n Did you ever touch Lisp at all?\n\n2:55:00.880 --> 2:55:03.400\n Like what were your emotional feelings\n\n2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:04.240\n about all the parentheses?\n\n2:55:04.240 --> 2:55:05.440\n Yeah, so great question.\n\n2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:08.240\n So I find myself appreciating Lisp today\n\n2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:09.680\n much more than I did early.\n\n2:55:09.680 --> 2:55:11.680\n Because when I came to programming, I knew programming,\n\n2:55:11.680 --> 2:55:13.000\n but I was a domain expert, right?\n\n2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.720\n And to me, the parentheses were in the way.\n\n2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:17.800\n It's like, wow, there's just all this,\n\n2:55:17.800 --> 2:55:19.320\n like it just gets in the way of my thinking\n\n2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:20.160\n about what I'm doing.\n\n2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:22.440\n So why would I have all these, right?\n\n2:55:22.440 --> 2:55:24.760\n That was my initial reaction to it.\n\n2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:27.320\n And now as I appreciate kind of the structure\n\n2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:30.280\n that kind of naturally maps to a logical thinking\n\n2:55:30.280 --> 2:55:33.000\n about a program, I can appreciate them, right?\n\n2:55:33.000 --> 2:55:35.680\n And why it's actually, you could create editors\n\n2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:39.680\n that make it not so problematic, right, honestly.\n\n2:55:40.720 --> 2:55:43.000\n So I actually have a much more appreciation of Lisp\n\n2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:44.720\n and things like Clojure and there's HyVee,\n\n2:55:44.720 --> 2:55:48.560\n which is a Python Lisp that compiles the Python bytecode.\n\n2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:50.280\n I think it's challenging.\n\n2:55:50.280 --> 2:55:53.160\n Like typically these languages are,\n\n2:55:53.160 --> 2:55:55.280\n I even saw the whole data science programming system\n\n2:55:55.280 --> 2:55:58.360\n in Lisp that somebody created, which is cool.\n\n2:55:58.360 --> 2:56:00.840\n But again, I think it's the lack of recognition\n\n2:56:00.840 --> 2:56:02.020\n of the fact that there exists\n\n2:56:02.020 --> 2:56:04.080\n what I call occasional programmers.\n\n2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:05.840\n People that are never gonna be programmers for a living.\n\n2:56:05.840 --> 2:56:08.440\n They don't want to have all this cuteness in their head.\n\n2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:11.880\n They want just, it's why basic, you know,\n\n2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:14.480\n Microsoft had the right idea with basic\n\n2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:17.660\n in terms of having that be the language of visual basic,\n\n2:56:17.660 --> 2:56:21.280\n the language of Excel and SQL Server.\n\n2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:23.520\n They should have converted that to Python 10 years ago.\n\n2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:27.200\n Like the world would be a better place if they had, but.\n\n2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:29.660\n There's also, there's a beauty and a magic\n\n2:56:29.660 --> 2:56:31.640\n to the history behind a language in Lisp.\n\n2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:34.020\n You know, some of the most interesting people\n\n2:56:34.020 --> 2:56:35.880\n in the history of computer science\n\n2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:37.920\n and artificial intelligence have used Lisp.\n\n2:56:37.920 --> 2:56:40.000\n So you feel.\n\n2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:41.200\n Well, especially that language,\n\n2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:43.440\n when you have a language, you can think in it.\n\n2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:44.280\n And it helps you think better.\n\n2:56:44.280 --> 2:56:45.640\n And it attracts a certain kinds of people\n\n2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:46.920\n that think in a certain kind of way.\n\n2:56:46.920 --> 2:56:48.560\n And then that's there.\n\n2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:52.140\n Okay, so what about like small laptop with a tiny keyboard,\n\n2:56:52.140 --> 2:56:55.000\n or is there like three screens?\n\n2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:55.840\n You know, good question.\n\n2:56:55.840 --> 2:56:58.080\n I've never gotten into the big, many screens to be honest.\n\n2:56:58.080 --> 2:57:00.720\n I mean, and maybe it's because in my head,\n\n2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:03.480\n I kind of just, I just swap between windows.\n\n2:57:03.480 --> 2:57:07.480\n Like, partly because I guess I really can't process\n\n2:57:07.480 --> 2:57:09.200\n three screens at once anyway.\n\n2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:12.560\n Like, I just am looking at one and I just flip.\n\n2:57:12.560 --> 2:57:14.460\n You know, I flip an application open.\n\n2:57:14.460 --> 2:57:17.340\n So where it's really helpful is actually\n\n2:57:17.340 --> 2:57:18.440\n when I'm trying to do, you know,\n\n2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:20.240\n here's data and I want to input it from here.\n\n2:57:20.240 --> 2:57:22.280\n Like this is the only time I really need another screen.\n\n2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:25.960\n So now, because you're both a developer, lead developers,\n\n2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:27.880\n but then there's also these businesses\n\n2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:30.120\n and there's salespeople and you're working\n\n2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:30.960\n with large companies.\n\n2:57:30.960 --> 2:57:32.480\n Operations people, hiring people, yeah.\n\n2:57:32.480 --> 2:57:33.400\n The whole thing.\n\n2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:37.240\n Which operating system is your favorite at this point?\n\n2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:38.960\n So Linux was the early days.\n\n2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:41.460\n So yeah, I love Linux as a server side.\n\n2:57:41.460 --> 2:57:44.340\n And it was early days I had my own Linux desktop.\n\n2:57:44.340 --> 2:57:47.800\n I've been on Mac laptops for 10 years now.\n\n2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:50.040\n Yeah, this is what leadership looks like.\n\n2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:52.800\n As you switch to Mac.\n\n2:57:52.800 --> 2:57:53.800\n Okay, great.\n\n2:57:53.800 --> 2:57:56.480\n Pretty much, I mean, just the fact that I had\n\n2:57:56.480 --> 2:57:58.760\n to do PowerPoints, I had to do presentations\n\n2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:01.240\n and you know, plug in, I just couldn't mess\n\n2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:04.440\n with plugging in laptops, it wouldn't project and yeah.\n\n2:58:04.440 --> 2:58:08.380\n So you mentioned also Quantset Labs and things like that.\n\n2:58:09.240 --> 2:58:13.640\n Can you give advice on how to hire great programmers\n\n2:58:13.640 --> 2:58:14.600\n and great people?\n\n2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:18.040\n Yeah, I would say, produce an open source project,\n\n2:58:19.400 --> 2:58:21.560\n get people contributing to it and hire those people.\n\n2:58:21.560 --> 2:58:25.080\n Yeah, I mean, you're doing it sort of,\n\n2:58:25.080 --> 2:58:27.080\n you may be perhaps a little biased,\n\n2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:30.320\n but that's probably 100% really good advice.\n\n2:58:30.320 --> 2:58:31.800\n I find it hard to hire.\n\n2:58:31.800 --> 2:58:34.480\n I still find it hard to hire, like in terms of,\n\n2:58:34.480 --> 2:58:36.560\n I don't think that it's not hard to hire\n\n2:58:36.560 --> 2:58:39.320\n if I've worked with somebody for a couple of weeks,\n\n2:58:39.320 --> 2:58:43.600\n but an hour or two of interviews, I have no idea.\n\n2:58:43.600 --> 2:58:47.880\n So that instinct, that radar of knowing if you're good\n\n2:58:47.880 --> 2:58:50.720\n or not, that you've found that you're still not able to.\n\n2:58:50.720 --> 2:58:53.240\n It's really hard, I mean, the resume can help,\n\n2:58:53.240 --> 2:58:55.520\n but again, the resume is like a presentation\n\n2:58:55.520 --> 2:58:58.840\n of the things they want you to see, not the reality of,\n\n2:58:58.840 --> 2:59:02.800\n and there's also, you have to understand\n\n2:59:02.800 --> 2:59:03.960\n what you're hiring for.\n\n2:59:03.960 --> 2:59:06.800\n There are different stages and different kinds of skills.\n\n2:59:06.800 --> 2:59:10.940\n And so it isn't just, one of the things I talk a lot about\n\n2:59:10.940 --> 2:59:14.440\n internally at my company is just that the whole idea\n\n2:59:14.440 --> 2:59:18.600\n of measuring ourselves against a single axis is flawed\n\n2:59:18.600 --> 2:59:20.600\n because we're not, it's a multidimensional space\n\n2:59:20.600 --> 2:59:22.120\n and how do you order a multidimensional space?\n\n2:59:22.120 --> 2:59:23.440\n There isn't one ordering.\n\n2:59:23.440 --> 2:59:26.160\n So this whole idea, you immediately get projected\n\n2:59:26.160 --> 2:59:28.200\n into a thing when you're talking about hiring\n\n2:59:28.200 --> 2:59:30.660\n or best or worst or better or not better.\n\n2:59:30.660 --> 2:59:33.500\n So what is the thing you're actually needing?\n\n2:59:33.500 --> 2:59:35.960\n And you can hire for that.\n\n2:59:35.960 --> 2:59:39.040\n There is such a thing, generally, I really value people\n\n2:59:39.040 --> 2:59:42.920\n who have the affect, that care about open source.\n\n2:59:42.920 --> 2:59:45.720\n Like so in some cases, their affinity to open source\n\n2:59:45.720 --> 2:59:48.100\n is simply kind of a filter of an affect.\n\n2:59:49.100 --> 2:59:52.560\n However, I have found this interesting dichotomy\n\n2:59:52.560 --> 2:59:58.520\n between open source contributors and product creation.\n\n2:59:58.520 --> 3:00:00.560\n There's, I don't know if it's fully true,\n\n3:00:00.560 --> 3:00:04.960\n but there does seem to be the more experienced,\n\n3:00:04.960 --> 3:00:08.160\n the more affect somebody has an open source community,\n\n3:00:08.160 --> 3:00:11.640\n the less ability to actually produce product that they have.\n\n3:00:11.640 --> 3:00:13.520\n And the opposite is kind of true too.\n\n3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:16.000\n The more product focused are, I find a lot of people,\n\n3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:17.020\n I've talked to a lot of people who produce\n\n3:00:17.020 --> 3:00:19.400\n really great products and they have a,\n\n3:00:19.400 --> 3:00:21.120\n they're looking over the open source communities,\n\n3:00:21.120 --> 3:00:23.320\n kind of wanting to participate and play,\n\n3:00:23.320 --> 3:00:26.000\n but they've played here and they do a great job here\n\n3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:29.520\n and then they don't necessarily have some of the same.\n\n3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:32.040\n Now I don't think that's entirely necessary.\n\n3:00:32.040 --> 3:00:34.880\n I think part of it is cultural, how they've emerged.\n\n3:00:34.880 --> 3:00:36.300\n Because one of the things that open source communities\n\n3:00:36.300 --> 3:00:39.160\n often lack is great product management,\n\n3:00:39.160 --> 3:00:41.000\n like some product management energy.\n\n3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:43.600\n That's brilliant, but you want both of those energies\n\n3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:44.880\n in the same place together.\n\n3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:45.840\n Yes, you really do.\n\n3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:48.120\n And so a lot of it's creating these teams of people\n\n3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:50.480\n that have these needed skills and attributes\n\n3:00:50.480 --> 3:00:51.880\n that are hard.\n\n3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:55.120\n And so one of the big things I look for is somebody\n\n3:00:55.120 --> 3:00:57.800\n that fundamentally recognizes their need to learn.\n\n3:00:57.800 --> 3:00:59.560\n Like one of the values that we have\n\n3:00:59.560 --> 3:01:01.400\n in all of the things we do is learning.\n\n3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:04.560\n Like if somebody thinks they know it all,\n\n3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:06.240\n they're gonna struggle.\n\n3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:09.440\n And some of that is just, there's more basic things\n\n3:01:09.440 --> 3:01:12.780\n like humility, just being humble in the face\n\n3:01:12.780 --> 3:01:14.400\n of all the things you don't know.\n\n3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:15.840\n And that's step one of learning.\n\n3:01:15.840 --> 3:01:16.960\n That's step one of learning, right?\n\n3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:20.840\n And I've spent a lot of time learning, right?\n\n3:01:20.840 --> 3:01:21.840\n Other people spend a lot more time,\n\n3:01:21.840 --> 3:01:23.280\n but I've spent a lot of time learning.\n\n3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:26.320\n My whole goal was to get a PhD because I love school\n\n3:01:26.320 --> 3:01:28.240\n and I wanted to be a scientist.\n\n3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:31.120\n And then what I found is what's been written about\n\n3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:32.600\n elsewhere as well is the more I learned,\n\n3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:33.780\n the more I didn't know.\n\n3:01:33.780 --> 3:01:37.680\n The more I realized, man, I know about this,\n\n3:01:37.680 --> 3:01:40.060\n but this is such a tiny thing in the global scope\n\n3:01:40.060 --> 3:01:41.220\n of what I might wanna know about.\n\n3:01:41.220 --> 3:01:43.840\n So I need to be listening a whole lot better\n\n3:01:43.840 --> 3:01:47.360\n than I am just talking.\n\n3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:48.840\n That's changed a little bit actually.\n\n3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:50.600\n My wife says that I used to be a better listener.\n\n3:01:50.600 --> 3:01:52.880\n Now that I'm so full of all these ideas I wanna do,\n\n3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:55.520\n she kind of says, you gotta give people time to talk.\n\n3:01:55.520 --> 3:01:58.400\n So you've succeeded on multiple dimensions.\n\n3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:01.680\n So one is the tenure track faculty.\n\n3:02:01.680 --> 3:02:03.080\n The other is just creating all these products\n\n3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:04.320\n and building up the businesses,\n\n3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:06.880\n then working with businesses.\n\n3:02:06.880 --> 3:02:09.240\n Do you have advice for young people today\n\n3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:13.880\n in high school and college of how to live a life\n\n3:02:13.880 --> 3:02:18.280\n as nonlinear and as successful as yours,\n\n3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:21.200\n a life that they could be proud of?\n\n3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:22.960\n Well, that's a super compliment.\n\n3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:24.200\n I'm humbled by that actually.\n\n3:02:24.200 --> 3:02:27.960\n I would say a life they can be proud of.\n\n3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:31.560\n Honestly, one thing that I've said to people is first,\n\n3:02:31.560 --> 3:02:34.240\n find people you love and care about them.\n\n3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:36.040\n Like family matters to me a lot.\n\n3:02:36.040 --> 3:02:39.640\n And family means people you love and have committed to.\n\n3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:42.160\n So it can be whatever you mean by that,\n\n3:02:42.160 --> 3:02:45.120\n but you need to have a foundation.\n\n3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:47.840\n So find people you love and wanna commit to and do that.\n\n3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:52.200\n Cause it anchors you in a way that nothing else can.\n\n3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:55.200\n And then you find other things.\n\n3:02:55.200 --> 3:02:56.640\n And then kind of from out there,\n\n3:02:56.640 --> 3:02:58.800\n you find other kinds of things you can commit to,\n\n3:02:58.800 --> 3:03:03.240\n whether it's ideas or people or groups of people.\n\n3:03:03.240 --> 3:03:06.400\n So, especially in high school,\n\n3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:09.320\n I would say don't settle on what you think you know.\n\n3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:13.320\n Like give yourself 10 years to think about the world.\n\n3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:15.440\n Like I see a lot of high school students\n\n3:03:15.440 --> 3:03:17.640\n who seem to know everything already.\n\n3:03:17.640 --> 3:03:18.720\n I think I did too.\n\n3:03:18.720 --> 3:03:20.360\n I think it's maybe natural,\n\n3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:23.160\n but recognize that the things you care about,\n\n3:03:23.160 --> 3:03:26.520\n you might change your perspective over time.\n\n3:03:26.520 --> 3:03:28.600\n I certainly have over time.\n\n3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:30.640\n I was really passionate about one specific thing\n\n3:03:30.640 --> 3:03:32.520\n and I was kind of softened.\n\n3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:35.760\n I was a big, I didn't like the Federal Reserve, right?\n\n3:03:35.760 --> 3:03:38.480\n And there's still, we could have a longer conversation\n\n3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:40.120\n about monetary policy and finances,\n\n3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:45.120\n but I'm a little more nuanced in my perspective\n\n3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:46.840\n at this point.\n\n3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:50.160\n But that's one area where you learn about something,\n\n3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:51.360\n go, ah, I wanna attack it.\n\n3:03:52.440 --> 3:03:54.120\n Build, don't destroy.\n\n3:03:55.160 --> 3:03:58.400\n Build, like so often the tendency is to not like something\n\n3:03:58.400 --> 3:04:00.000\n and wanna go attack it.\n\n3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:02.240\n Build something, build something to replace it.\n\n3:04:02.240 --> 3:04:03.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:05.600\n Build up, attract people to your new thing.\n\n3:04:05.600 --> 3:04:08.800\n You'll be far better, right?\n\n3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:12.600\n You don't need to destroy something to build something else.\n\n3:04:12.600 --> 3:04:14.880\n So that's, I guess, generally.\n\n3:04:14.880 --> 3:04:19.120\n And then definitely like curiosity,\n\n3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:22.680\n follow your curiosity and let it,\n\n3:04:22.680 --> 3:04:24.600\n don't just follow the money.\n\n3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:25.800\n And all of that, like you said,\n\n3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:30.160\n is grounded in family, friendship, and ultimately love.\n\n3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:31.200\n Yes.\n\n3:04:31.200 --> 3:04:34.640\n Which is a great way to end it.\n\n3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:37.080\n Travis, you're one of the most impactful people\n\n3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:38.760\n in the engineering and the computer science\n\n3:04:38.760 --> 3:04:39.920\n in the human world.\n\n3:04:39.920 --> 3:04:43.520\n So I truly appreciate everything you've done.\n\n3:04:43.520 --> 3:04:45.800\n And I really appreciate that you would spend\n\n3:04:45.800 --> 3:04:46.960\n your valuable time with me.\n\n3:04:46.960 --> 3:04:47.800\n It was an honor.\n\n3:04:47.800 --> 3:04:48.840\n It was a real pleasure for me.\n\n3:04:48.840 --> 3:04:50.520\n I appreciate that.\n\n3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:52.080\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:04:52.080 --> 3:04:54.000\n with Travis Oliphant.\n\n3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:55.320\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:04:55.320 --> 3:04:57.900\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:04:57.900 --> 3:05:00.200\n And now, let me leave you with something\n\n3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:04.060\n that in the programming world is called Hodgson's Law.\n\n3:05:04.960 --> 3:05:08.120\n Every sufficiently advanced Lisp application\n\n3:05:08.120 --> 3:05:12.520\n will eventually be re implemented in Python.\n\n3:05:12.520 --> 3:05:31.520\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
