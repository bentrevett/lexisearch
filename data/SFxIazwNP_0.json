coexisting on a planet,\n\n00:05.560 --> 00:07.080\n what's that look like exactly?\n\n00:07.080 --> 00:09.720\n When you see them and they see you,\n\n00:09.720 --> 00:11.440\n you're assuming they have vision,\n\n00:11.440 --> 00:14.520\n they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.\n\n00:14.520 --> 00:16.360\n That's a lot of assumptions they're making.\n\n00:16.360 --> 00:19.660\n What human level intelligence has done is quite different.\n\n00:19.660 --> 00:21.600\n It's not just that we remember states\n\n00:21.600 --> 00:23.880\n that the universe has existed in before,\n\n00:23.880 --> 00:26.600\n it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed\n\n00:26.600 --> 00:29.200\n and we can actually make them come into existence.\n\n00:29.200 --> 00:32.560\n So you can travel back in time sometimes.\n\n00:32.560 --> 00:33.400\n Yes.\n\n00:33.400 --> 00:35.040\n You travel forward in time to travel back.\n\n00:35.040 --> 00:35.880\n Yes.\n\n00:38.960 --> 00:40.320\n The following is a conversation\n\n00:40.320 --> 00:42.720\n with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.\n\n00:42.720 --> 00:45.280\n They have each been on this podcast once before\n\n00:45.280 --> 00:48.400\n individually and now for their second time,\n\n00:48.400 --> 00:49.880\n they're here together.\n\n00:49.880 --> 00:53.960\n Sarah is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist.\n\n00:53.960 --> 00:57.760\n Lee is a chemist and if I may say so,\n\n00:57.760 --> 01:01.580\n the real life manifestation of Rick from Rick and Morty.\n\n01:01.580 --> 01:04.360\n They both are interested in how life originates\n\n01:04.360 --> 01:08.520\n and develops both life here on earth and alien life,\n\n01:08.520 --> 01:11.240\n including intelligent alien civilizations\n\n01:11.240 --> 01:13.240\n out there in the cosmos.\n\n01:13.240 --> 01:15.520\n They are colleagues and friends\n\n01:15.520 --> 01:18.000\n who love to explore, disagree and debate\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.200\n nuanced points about alien life.\n\n01:20.200 --> 01:24.560\n And so we're calling this an alien debate.\n\n01:24.560 --> 01:27.280\n Very few questions to me are as fascinating\n\n01:27.280 --> 01:29.000\n as what do aliens look like?\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:30.640\n How do we recognize them?\n\n01:30.640 --> 01:32.160\n How do we talk to them?\n\n01:32.160 --> 01:34.920\n And how do we make sense of life here on earth\n\n01:34.920 --> 01:37.120\n in the context of all possible life forms\n\n01:37.120 --> 01:38.640\n that are out there?\n\n01:38.640 --> 01:41.320\n Treating these questions with the seriousness\n\n01:41.320 --> 01:44.240\n and rigor they deserve is what I hope to do\n\n01:44.240 --> 01:48.200\n with this conversation and future ones like it.\n\n01:48.200 --> 01:50.400\n Our world is shrouded in mystery.\n\n01:50.400 --> 01:52.720\n We must first be humble to acknowledge this\n\n01:52.720 --> 01:54.840\n and then be bold and diving in\n\n01:54.840 --> 01:57.360\n and trying to figure things out anyway.\n\n01:57.360 --> 01:59.480\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:59.480 --> 02:01.560\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n02:01.560 --> 02:02.960\n in the description.\n\n02:02.960 --> 02:07.700\n And now, dear friends, here's Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.\n\n02:08.600 --> 02:11.080\n First of all, welcome back Sarah, welcome back Lee.\n\n02:11.080 --> 02:12.680\n You guys, I'm a huge fan of yours.\n\n02:12.680 --> 02:13.680\n You're incredible people.\n\n02:13.680 --> 02:14.880\n I should say thank you to Sarah\n\n02:14.880 --> 02:17.320\n for wearing really awesome boots.\n\n02:17.320 --> 02:19.660\n We'll probably overlay a picture later on,\n\n02:19.660 --> 02:21.720\n but why the hell didn't you dress up, Lee?\n\n02:21.720 --> 02:22.560\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n02:22.560 --> 02:23.400\n This is me dressed up.\n\n02:23.400 --> 02:25.280\n You were saying that you're pink,\n\n02:25.280 --> 02:26.900\n that your thing is pink.\n\n02:26.900 --> 02:30.200\n My thing is black and white, the simplicity of it.\n\n02:30.200 --> 02:31.140\n Where's the pink?\n\n02:31.140 --> 02:33.400\n When did the pink, when did it hit you\n\n02:33.400 --> 02:34.240\n that pink is your color?\n\n02:34.240 --> 02:39.240\n I became pink about, I don't know, actually, maybe 2017.\n\n02:41.480 --> 02:42.320\n Did you know me when you first?\n\n02:42.320 --> 02:44.040\n I think I met you pre pink.\n\n02:44.040 --> 02:46.600\n Yeah, yeah, so about 2017, I think.\n\n02:46.600 --> 02:48.920\n I just decided I was boring\n\n02:48.920 --> 02:50.360\n and I needed to make a statement\n\n02:50.360 --> 02:53.840\n and red was too bright, so I went pink, salmon pink.\n\n02:53.840 --> 02:55.320\n Well, I think you were always pink.\n\n02:55.320 --> 02:57.520\n You just found yourself in 2017.\n\n02:59.040 --> 03:00.540\n There's an amazing photo of him\n\n03:00.540 --> 03:02.280\n where there's like everybody in their black gown\n\n03:02.280 --> 03:03.640\n and he's just wearing the pink pants.\n\n03:03.640 --> 03:05.280\n Oh, that was at the Waggonen University.\n\n03:05.280 --> 03:06.320\n It's totally nuts.\n\n03:06.320 --> 03:08.760\n 100 year anniversary, they got me to give the plenary\n\n03:08.760 --> 03:10.800\n and they didn't find that outfit for me,\n\n03:10.800 --> 03:13.120\n so they were all wearing these silly hats and these gowns\n\n03:13.120 --> 03:14.360\n and there was me dressed up in pink\n\n03:14.360 --> 03:15.960\n looking like a complete idiot.\n\n03:15.960 --> 03:18.000\n We're definitely gonna have to find that picture\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.200\n and overlay it, big full screen, slow motion.\n\n03:22.200 --> 03:23.680\n All right, let's talk about aliens.\n\n03:23.680 --> 03:27.080\n We'll find places we disagree and places we agree,\n\n03:28.160 --> 03:31.300\n life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that.\n\n03:31.300 --> 03:35.520\n Let's start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\n03:35.520 --> 03:39.660\n stating his skepticism about aliens wanting to visit Earth.\n\n03:39.660 --> 03:44.040\n Quote, how egocentric of us to think that space aliens\n\n03:44.040 --> 03:47.560\n who have mastered interstellar travel across the galaxy\n\n03:47.560 --> 03:51.640\n would give, pardon the French,\n\n03:51.640 --> 03:54.880\n would give a shit about humans on Earth.\n\n03:54.880 --> 03:57.980\n So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth,\n\n03:57.980 --> 04:00.500\n observing, communicating with humans?\n\n04:00.500 --> 04:05.080\n Let's take a perspective of aliens, maybe Sarah first.\n\n04:05.080 --> 04:08.400\n Are we interesting in the whole spectrum\n\n04:08.400 --> 04:10.240\n of life in the universe?\n\n04:11.080 --> 04:13.780\n I'm completely biased, at least as far as I think right now\n\n04:13.780 --> 04:16.360\n we're the most interesting thing in the universe.\n\n04:16.360 --> 04:21.360\n So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity\n\n04:21.560 --> 04:25.040\n that we have and how much I think that's deeply related\n\n04:25.040 --> 04:26.680\n to the physics of what we are,\n\n04:26.680 --> 04:29.920\n that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out\n\n04:29.920 --> 04:32.280\n examples of the phenomena they are\n\n04:32.280 --> 04:34.460\n to understand themselves better.\n\n04:34.460 --> 04:37.240\n And I think that's kind of a natural thing to want to do.\n\n04:37.240 --> 04:39.400\n And I don't think there's any kind of judgment\n\n04:39.400 --> 04:42.040\n on it being a lesser being or not.\n\n04:42.040 --> 04:43.440\n It's like saying you have nothing to learn\n\n04:43.440 --> 04:45.160\n by talking to a baby.\n\n04:45.160 --> 04:47.040\n You have lots to learn, probably more than you do\n\n04:47.040 --> 04:48.360\n talking to somebody that's 90.\n\n04:48.360 --> 04:51.440\n So yeah, so I think they absolutely would.\n\n04:51.440 --> 04:55.280\n So whatever the phenomena is that is human,\n\n04:55.280 --> 04:57.680\n there will be an inkling of the same kind of phenomena\n\n04:57.680 --> 05:00.800\n within alien species and they will be seeking that same.\n\n05:00.800 --> 05:02.440\n I think there's gotta be some features of us\n\n05:02.440 --> 05:03.600\n that are universal.\n\n05:03.600 --> 05:06.520\n And I think the ones that are most interesting,\n\n05:06.520 --> 05:08.660\n and I hope I live in an interesting universe,\n\n05:08.660 --> 05:13.660\n are the ones that are driven by our curiosity\n\n05:13.660 --> 05:18.380\n and the fact that our intelligence allows us to do things\n\n05:18.380 --> 05:19.740\n that the universe wouldn't be able to do\n\n05:19.740 --> 05:21.300\n without things like us existing.\n\n05:22.500 --> 05:23.980\n We're gonna define a lot of terms.\n\n05:23.980 --> 05:25.820\n One of them is interesting.\n\n05:25.820 --> 05:26.660\n Yes.\n\n05:26.660 --> 05:29.180\n That's a very interesting term to try to define.\n\n05:29.180 --> 05:30.420\n Ali, what do you think?\n\n05:30.420 --> 05:33.260\n Are humans interesting for aliens?\n\n05:33.260 --> 05:34.580\n Well, let's take it from our perspective.\n\n05:34.580 --> 05:37.500\n We want to go find aliens as a species quite desperately.\n\n05:37.500 --> 05:39.500\n So if we put the shoe on the other foot,\n\n05:39.500 --> 05:41.140\n of course we're interesting.\n\n05:41.140 --> 05:44.180\n But I'm wondering and assuming\n\n05:44.180 --> 05:45.940\n that we're at the right technological capabilities\n\n05:45.940 --> 05:48.940\n to go searching for aliens, then that's interesting.\n\n05:48.940 --> 05:50.300\n So what I mean is,\n\n05:50.300 --> 05:52.980\n if there needs to be a massive leap in technology\n\n05:52.980 --> 05:54.260\n that we don't have,\n\n05:55.420 --> 05:58.620\n how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?\n\n05:58.620 --> 06:02.300\n But I do think that they would come and find us\n\n06:02.300 --> 06:04.740\n because they'd want to find out about our culture,\n\n06:04.740 --> 06:06.740\n what things are universal.\n\n06:06.740 --> 06:07.580\n I mean, I'm a chemist.\n\n06:07.580 --> 06:09.980\n I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?\n\n06:09.980 --> 06:11.780\n Are the creatures that we're going to find\n\n06:11.780 --> 06:13.540\n making all this commotion,\n\n06:13.540 --> 06:15.300\n are they made of the same stuff?\n\n06:17.220 --> 06:19.180\n What does their science look like?\n\n06:20.260 --> 06:22.540\n Are they off planet yet?\n\n06:22.540 --> 06:25.860\n I guess there's, so I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\n06:25.860 --> 06:27.380\n is being slightly pessimistic\n\n06:27.380 --> 06:31.780\n and maybe trying to play the tune\n\n06:31.780 --> 06:33.140\n that the universe is vast\n\n06:33.140 --> 06:35.140\n and it's not worth them coming here.\n\n06:35.140 --> 06:37.340\n I don't think that,\n\n06:37.340 --> 06:39.740\n but I just worry that maybe we don't have\n\n06:39.740 --> 06:40.780\n the ability to talk to them.\n\n06:40.780 --> 06:42.260\n We don't have the universal translator.\n\n06:42.260 --> 06:43.460\n We don't have the right physics,\n\n06:43.460 --> 06:45.180\n but sure, they should come.\n\n06:45.180 --> 06:46.100\n We are interesting.\n\n06:46.100 --> 06:47.460\n I want to know if they exist.\n\n06:47.460 --> 06:49.500\n It would make it easier if they just came.\n\n06:50.620 --> 06:54.300\n So again, I'm going to use your tweets\n\n06:54.300 --> 06:56.100\n like it's Shakespeare and analyze it.\n\n06:56.100 --> 06:57.300\n So Sarah tweeted,\n\n06:58.340 --> 07:01.500\n thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.\n\n07:01.500 --> 07:04.500\n So how much do you think aliens\n\n07:04.500 --> 07:07.660\n are thinking about other aliens, including humans?\n\n07:07.660 --> 07:11.980\n So you said, we humans want to visit.\n\n07:13.180 --> 07:15.260\n Like we're longing to connect with aliens.\n\n07:15.260 --> 07:16.100\n Why is that?\n\n07:16.100 --> 07:16.940\n Can you introspect that?\n\n07:16.940 --> 07:18.620\n Is that an obvious thing that we should be,\n\n07:18.620 --> 07:20.740\n like what are we hoping to understand\n\n07:20.740 --> 07:23.580\n by meeting aliens exactly?\n\n07:23.580 --> 07:25.500\n Asking as an introvert, it's like,\n\n07:25.500 --> 07:26.740\n I ask myself this all the time.\n\n07:26.740 --> 07:30.260\n Why go out on a Friday night to meet people?\n\n07:30.260 --> 07:31.100\n What are you hoping to find?\n\n07:31.100 --> 07:33.700\n I think the curiosity, so when I saw Sarah put that tweet,\n\n07:33.700 --> 07:35.300\n I think I answered it actually as well,\n\n07:35.300 --> 07:38.900\n which was we are thinking about trying to make contact.\n\n07:38.900 --> 07:41.780\n So they almost certainly are,\n\n07:41.780 --> 07:43.500\n but maybe there's a number of classes.\n\n07:43.500 --> 07:46.780\n There are those aliens that have not yet made contact\n\n07:46.780 --> 07:48.980\n with other aliens like us.\n\n07:48.980 --> 07:51.780\n Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien\n\n07:51.780 --> 07:55.060\n and maybe it's an anticlimax and slime, right?\n\n07:55.060 --> 07:56.580\n And aliens have made contact\n\n07:56.580 --> 07:59.780\n with not just one set of intelligent species, but several.\n\n07:59.780 --> 08:01.140\n That must be amazing actually.\n\n08:01.140 --> 08:03.380\n Literally there are some place in the universe,\n\n08:03.380 --> 08:05.060\n there must be one alien civilization.\n\n08:05.060 --> 08:07.060\n Let's not make contact with not one,\n\n08:07.060 --> 08:09.740\n but two other intelligent civilizations.\n\n08:10.620 --> 08:12.180\n So they must be thinking about it.\n\n08:12.180 --> 08:16.540\n There must be entire degree courses on aliens,\n\n08:16.540 --> 08:21.540\n thinking about aliens and universal cultural norms.\n\n08:21.540 --> 08:24.540\n Do you think they will survive the meeting?\n\n08:24.540 --> 08:26.580\n And by the way, Lee did respond saying,\n\n08:26.580 --> 08:28.580\n that's all the universe wants.\n\n08:28.580 --> 08:31.980\n So Sarah said, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.\n\n08:31.980 --> 08:34.500\n Lee said, that's all the universe wants.\n\n08:34.500 --> 08:38.740\n And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in.\n\n08:38.740 --> 08:42.180\n So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting,\n\n08:42.180 --> 08:45.260\n all of which we'll try to define mathematically.\n\n08:45.260 --> 08:47.180\n Cheeky might be harder than interesting.\n\n08:47.180 --> 08:48.620\n Because there's humor in that too.\n\n08:48.620 --> 08:49.500\n Yes.\n\n08:49.500 --> 08:51.460\n I think there's a mathematical definition of humor,\n\n08:51.460 --> 08:52.500\n but we'll talk about that in a bit.\n\n08:52.500 --> 08:53.460\n Oh interesting.\n\n08:53.460 --> 08:54.620\n Yeah, sure there is, yeah.\n\n08:54.620 --> 08:57.740\n So if you're a graduate student alien\n\n08:57.740 --> 09:00.780\n looking at multiple alien civilizations,\n\n09:00.780 --> 09:03.580\n do you think they survive the encounters?\n\n09:03.580 --> 09:06.580\n I think there's a tendency to anthropomorphize\n\n09:06.580 --> 09:08.140\n a lot of the discussions about alien life,\n\n09:08.140 --> 09:10.140\n which is a really big challenge.\n\n09:10.140 --> 09:13.100\n So usually when I'm trying to think about these problems,\n\n09:13.100 --> 09:16.500\n I don't try to think about us as humans,\n\n09:16.500 --> 09:18.260\n but us as an example of phenomenon\n\n09:18.260 --> 09:21.340\n that exists in the universe that we have yet to explain.\n\n09:21.340 --> 09:24.460\n And it doesn't seem to be the case\n\n09:24.460 --> 09:27.620\n that if I think about the features,\n\n09:27.620 --> 09:30.500\n I would argue are most universal about that phenomenon,\n\n09:30.500 --> 09:31.780\n that there's any reason to think\n\n09:31.780 --> 09:35.020\n that a first encounter with another lineage\n\n09:35.020 --> 09:38.860\n or example of life would be antagonistic.\n\n09:40.500 --> 09:42.700\n I think, yeah.\n\n09:42.700 --> 09:46.020\n And I think there's this kind of assumption,\n\n09:46.020 --> 09:49.340\n I mean, going back to Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote,\n\n09:49.340 --> 09:51.220\n I mean, it kind of bothers me because there's a,\n\n09:51.220 --> 09:52.100\n I mean, I'm a physicist,\n\n09:52.100 --> 09:53.700\n so I know we have a lot of egos\n\n09:53.700 --> 09:56.260\n about how much we can describe the world,\n\n09:56.260 --> 09:57.700\n but that there's this like,\n\n09:57.700 --> 09:59.660\n because we understand fundamental physics so well,\n\n09:59.660 --> 10:02.740\n we understand alien life and we can kind of extrapolate,\n\n10:02.740 --> 10:04.620\n and I just think that we don't.\n\n10:04.620 --> 10:06.780\n And the quest there is really, you know,\n\n10:06.780 --> 10:09.220\n really to understand something totally new\n\n10:09.220 --> 10:11.700\n about the universe, and that thing just happens to be us.\n\n10:11.700 --> 10:12.660\n I agree, I agree.\n\n10:12.660 --> 10:13.900\n There's something else more profound.\n\n10:13.900 --> 10:15.980\n I think Neil was just being, again,\n\n10:15.980 --> 10:17.900\n he's just trying to stir the pot.\n\n10:17.900 --> 10:21.380\n I would say from a contingency point of view,\n\n10:21.380 --> 10:22.700\n I want to know how many ways\n\n10:22.700 --> 10:26.380\n does the universe build structures, build memories, right?\n\n10:26.380 --> 10:29.140\n And then I want to know if those memories\n\n10:29.140 --> 10:30.100\n can interact with each other.\n\n10:30.100 --> 10:33.660\n And if you have two different origins of life\n\n10:33.660 --> 10:34.780\n and then origins of intelligence,\n\n10:34.780 --> 10:36.740\n and then these things become conscious,\n\n10:36.740 --> 10:37.940\n surely you want to go and talk to them\n\n10:37.940 --> 10:41.900\n and figure out what commonalities you share.\n\n10:41.900 --> 10:43.980\n And it might be that we're just unable to conceive\n\n10:43.980 --> 10:44.940\n of what they're going to look like.\n\n10:44.940 --> 10:46.380\n They're just going to be completely different,\n\n10:46.380 --> 10:48.500\n you know, infrastructure,\n\n10:48.500 --> 10:50.420\n but surely we'll want to go and find out a map.\n\n10:50.420 --> 10:52.420\n And surely curiosity is a property\n\n10:52.420 --> 10:55.100\n that evolution has made on earth.\n\n10:55.100 --> 10:57.140\n And I can't see any reason\n\n10:57.140 --> 10:58.380\n that it won't happen elsewhere\n\n10:58.380 --> 11:00.260\n because curiosity probably exists\n\n11:00.260 --> 11:03.700\n because we want to find innovations in the environment.\n\n11:03.700 --> 11:08.620\n We want to use that information to help our technology.\n\n11:08.620 --> 11:10.780\n And also curiosity is like planning for the future.\n\n11:10.780 --> 11:12.100\n Are they going to fight us?\n\n11:12.100 --> 11:15.140\n Are we going to be able to trade with them?\n\n11:15.140 --> 11:17.020\n So I think that Neil's just, I don't know,\n\n11:17.020 --> 11:19.340\n maybe, you know, I mean, give a shit.\n\n11:19.340 --> 11:22.620\n That's really, I think that's really down on earth, right?\n\n11:22.620 --> 11:25.020\n How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?\n\n11:25.940 --> 11:26.780\n How would we?\n\n11:26.780 --> 11:28.140\n So let's put it the other way around.\n\n11:28.140 --> 11:29.100\n Slime category.\n\n11:29.100 --> 11:30.460\n Maybe, no, no, no.\n\n11:30.460 --> 11:33.260\n Maybe we could, the thing is a bit odd, right?\n\n11:33.260 --> 11:35.500\n Look at Instagram, Twitter,\n\n11:35.500 --> 11:36.820\n all these people taking selfies.\n\n11:36.820 --> 11:38.380\n I mean, does the universe\n\n11:38.380 --> 11:40.740\n is the ultimate state of consciousness,\n\n11:40.740 --> 11:42.860\n thinking beings that take photographs themselves\n\n11:42.860 --> 11:44.220\n and upload them to an internet\n\n11:44.220 --> 11:46.940\n with other thinking beings looking at each other's photos.\n\n11:46.940 --> 11:49.540\n So I think that they will be.\n\n11:49.540 --> 11:50.980\n What's wrong with that?\n\n11:50.980 --> 11:53.540\n I did not say there was anything wrong with it.\n\n11:53.540 --> 11:56.700\n It's consciousness manifested at scale.\n\n11:56.700 --> 11:58.420\n Selfies, Instagram.\n\n11:58.420 --> 12:00.060\n It's like the mirror test at scale.\n\n12:00.060 --> 12:02.580\n Yeah, I do think that curiosity\n\n12:02.580 --> 12:04.220\n is really the driving force\n\n12:04.220 --> 12:05.940\n for why we have our technology, right?\n\n12:05.940 --> 12:08.500\n If we weren't curious, we wouldn't go out, left the cave.\n\n12:08.500 --> 12:09.580\n So I think that,\n\n12:11.660 --> 12:14.300\n so I think that Neil's got it completely wrong, in fact.\n\n12:14.300 --> 12:16.500\n Actually, of course they'd want to come here.\n\n12:16.500 --> 12:17.900\n It doesn't mean they are coming here.\n\n12:17.900 --> 12:19.460\n We've seen evidence for that.\n\n12:19.460 --> 12:21.940\n I guess we can argue about that, right?\n\n12:21.940 --> 12:23.820\n But I think that we want,\n\n12:23.820 --> 12:26.220\n I desperately, and I know that Sarah does too,\n\n12:26.220 --> 12:28.460\n but I won't speak for you, you're here.\n\n12:28.460 --> 12:30.020\n I desperately want to have missions\n\n12:30.020 --> 12:32.620\n to look for life in the solar system right now.\n\n12:32.620 --> 12:34.780\n I want to map life over the solar system.\n\n12:34.780 --> 12:36.340\n And then I want to understand how we can go\n\n12:36.340 --> 12:39.900\n and find life as quickly as possible at the nearest stars,\n\n12:39.900 --> 12:41.660\n and also at the same time do it in the lab,\n\n12:41.660 --> 12:44.380\n just to compensate, you know?\n\n12:44.380 --> 12:45.660\n So, sure.\n\n12:45.660 --> 12:47.380\n Yeah, just one more point on this.\n\n12:47.380 --> 12:49.900\n If you think about sort of what's driven\n\n12:49.900 --> 12:53.340\n the most features of our own evolution as a species,\n\n12:53.340 --> 12:55.060\n and try to map that to alien species,\n\n12:55.060 --> 12:57.980\n I always think like optimism is what's gonna get us furthest.\n\n12:57.980 --> 13:00.180\n And so I think a lot of people always think\n\n13:00.180 --> 13:02.660\n that it's like war and conflict is gonna be the way\n\n13:02.660 --> 13:06.060\n that alien species will expand out into the cosmos.\n\n13:06.060 --> 13:08.340\n But if you just look at how we're doing it\n\n13:08.340 --> 13:09.500\n and how we talk about it,\n\n13:09.500 --> 13:12.100\n so is our future in space is always, you know,\n\n13:12.100 --> 13:14.300\n built from narratives of optimism.\n\n13:14.300 --> 13:18.060\n And so it seems to me that if intelligence does get out\n\n13:18.060 --> 13:20.380\n in the universe, that it's gonna be more optimism\n\n13:20.380 --> 13:22.260\n and curiosity driving it than war and conflict,\n\n13:22.260 --> 13:25.540\n because those things end up crushing you.\n\n13:25.540 --> 13:28.020\n So there might be some selective filter.\n\n13:28.020 --> 13:29.460\n Of course, this is me being an optimist.\n\n13:29.460 --> 13:31.900\n I'm a half full kind of person, but.\n\n13:31.900 --> 13:35.500\n Is it obvious that curiosity, not obvious,\n\n13:35.500 --> 13:36.340\n but what do you think?\n\n13:36.340 --> 13:38.860\n Is curiosity a more powerful force in the universe\n\n13:38.860 --> 13:43.260\n than violence and the will to power?\n\n13:43.260 --> 13:47.300\n So, because you said you framed curiosity as a way\n\n13:47.300 --> 13:50.140\n to also plan on how to avoid violence,\n\n13:50.140 --> 13:52.460\n which is an interesting framing of curiosity.\n\n13:52.460 --> 13:55.820\n But I could also argue that violence\n\n13:55.820 --> 14:00.500\n is a pretty productive way to operate in the world,\n\n14:00.500 --> 14:02.620\n which is like, that's one way to protect yourself.\n\n14:02.620 --> 14:04.160\n The best defense is offense.\n\n14:05.860 --> 14:07.900\n I'm not qualified to answer this, but I'll have a go.\n\n14:07.900 --> 14:10.580\n I think violence, let's not talk about violence.\n\n14:10.580 --> 14:12.420\n That's the summary of this podcast.\n\n14:12.420 --> 14:16.620\n I would, yeah, maybe, I would, let's not call it violence,\n\n14:16.620 --> 14:17.820\n but I call it erasure.\n\n14:17.820 --> 14:20.100\n So if you think about the way evolution works,\n\n14:20.100 --> 14:23.560\n or the way, obviously talk about assembly theory,\n\n14:23.560 --> 14:24.400\n but I won't.\n\n14:24.400 --> 14:26.500\n So if you say you build,\n\n14:26.500 --> 14:29.140\n curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?\n\n14:29.140 --> 14:31.520\n So new features you can play.\n\n14:33.020 --> 14:36.180\n The ability to erase those things allows you to start again\n\n14:36.180 --> 14:37.500\n and do some pruning.\n\n14:37.500 --> 14:39.820\n So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest.\n\n14:39.820 --> 14:41.740\n Curiosity gets you rockets that land.\n\n14:41.740 --> 14:43.840\n It gets you robots that can make drugs.\n\n14:43.840 --> 14:48.540\n It gets you poetry and art and communication.\n\n14:48.540 --> 14:52.220\n And then, I often think wouldn't it be great in bureaucracy\n\n14:52.220 --> 14:54.820\n to have another world war, not literally a world war now,\n\n14:54.820 --> 14:57.260\n please no world war, but the equivalent\n\n14:57.260 --> 14:59.740\n so we get remove all the admin bureaucracy, right?\n\n14:59.740 --> 15:02.080\n All the admin violence, get rid of it and start again.\n\n15:02.080 --> 15:03.240\n Do you know what I mean?\n\n15:03.240 --> 15:06.220\n Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built.\n\n15:06.220 --> 15:09.280\n So actually a reset, let's not call it violence,\n\n15:09.280 --> 15:13.980\n a reset in some aspects of our culture\n\n15:13.980 --> 15:18.260\n and our technology allows us to then build\n\n15:18.260 --> 15:19.820\n more important things about the,\n\n15:19.820 --> 15:22.220\n because how many cookies do I have to click on?\n\n15:22.220 --> 15:26.860\n How many extra clicks do I have in the future of my life\n\n15:26.860 --> 15:29.500\n that I could remove and a bit of a reset\n\n15:29.500 --> 15:33.140\n would allow us to start again.\n\n15:33.140 --> 15:37.100\n And maybe that's how I suppose our encounter aliens will be.\n\n15:37.100 --> 15:38.380\n Maybe they will fight with us and say,\n\n15:38.380 --> 15:41.180\n oh, we're not as excited by you as we thought.\n\n15:41.180 --> 15:42.580\n We'll just get rid of you.\n\n15:42.580 --> 15:44.100\n So they might want to reset Earth.\n\n15:44.100 --> 15:44.940\n Yeah, why not?\n\n15:44.940 --> 15:47.340\n To be like, let's see how the evolution runs again.\n\n15:47.340 --> 15:51.700\n This seems like they've, there's nothing new happening here.\n\n15:51.700 --> 15:52.980\n They're observing for a while.\n\n15:52.980 --> 15:55.900\n This is just not, let's keep it more fun.\n\n15:55.900 --> 15:57.500\n Let's start with the fish again.\n\n15:59.180 --> 16:04.180\n I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies.\n\n16:04.220 --> 16:06.340\n I suppose that's the kind of violence.\n\n16:06.340 --> 16:08.780\n In this modern world where words are violence,\n\n16:08.780 --> 16:10.620\n resetting cookies is the kind of violence.\n\n16:10.620 --> 16:11.460\n I don't know where that came from.\n\n16:11.460 --> 16:12.280\n I'm completely, yeah.\n\n16:12.280 --> 16:14.260\n That's poetic, really.\n\n16:14.260 --> 16:17.460\n Okay, so let's talk about life.\n\n16:17.460 --> 16:19.300\n What is life?\n\n16:19.300 --> 16:20.660\n What is non life?\n\n16:20.660 --> 16:23.540\n What is the line between life and non life?\n\n16:23.540 --> 16:24.660\n And maybe at any point,\n\n16:24.660 --> 16:27.900\n we can pull in ideas of assembly theory.\n\n16:27.900 --> 16:29.980\n Like how do we start to try to define life?\n\n16:29.980 --> 16:32.100\n And for people listening,\n\n16:32.100 --> 16:35.340\n so Sarah identifies as a physicist\n\n16:35.340 --> 16:37.820\n and Lee identifies as a chemist.\n\n16:37.820 --> 16:41.540\n Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature\n\n16:41.540 --> 16:45.820\n in general, but so what is life?\n\n16:46.860 --> 16:47.700\n Sarah.\n\n16:49.140 --> 16:50.420\n I love asking that question\n\n16:50.420 --> 16:52.020\n because it's so absurdly big.\n\n16:52.020 --> 16:53.060\n I know, I love it.\n\n16:53.980 --> 16:56.940\n It's my absolute favorite question in the whole universe.\n\n16:56.940 --> 17:00.540\n So I think I have three ways of describing it right now.\n\n17:00.540 --> 17:01.740\n And I like to say all three of them\n\n17:01.740 --> 17:03.900\n because people latch onto different facets of them.\n\n17:03.900 --> 17:07.060\n And so the whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on\n\n17:07.060 --> 17:08.420\n is not to try to define life,\n\n17:08.420 --> 17:10.140\n but to try to find a more fundamental theory\n\n17:10.140 --> 17:12.220\n that explains what the phenomenon we call life.\n\n17:12.220 --> 17:14.140\n And then it should explain certain attributes\n\n17:14.140 --> 17:15.860\n and you end up having a really different framing\n\n17:15.860 --> 17:17.300\n than the way people usually talk.\n\n17:17.300 --> 17:19.660\n So the way I talk about it three different ways.\n\n17:20.620 --> 17:22.860\n Life is how information structures matter\n\n17:22.860 --> 17:24.100\n across space and time.\n\n17:25.140 --> 17:29.820\n Life is, I don't know, this one's from you actually,\n\n17:29.820 --> 17:32.540\n simple machines constructing more complex machines.\n\n17:32.540 --> 17:35.860\n And the other one is the physics of existence,\n\n17:35.860 --> 17:38.740\n so to speak, which is life is the mechanism\n\n17:38.740 --> 17:41.540\n the universe has to explore the space of what's possible.\n\n17:42.500 --> 17:43.740\n That's my favorite.\n\n17:43.740 --> 17:46.700\n So can I, yeah, yeah, can I add on to that?\n\n17:46.700 --> 17:49.380\n Okay, can you say the physics one again?\n\n17:49.380 --> 17:50.980\n Physics of existence.\n\n17:50.980 --> 17:52.140\n Yeah, the physics of existence.\n\n17:52.140 --> 17:53.780\n I don't know what to call it.\n\n17:53.780 --> 17:55.620\n If you think of all the things that could exist,\n\n17:55.620 --> 17:57.180\n only certain things do exist.\n\n17:57.180 --> 18:01.260\n And I think life is basically the universe's mechanism\n\n18:01.260 --> 18:03.460\n of bringing things into physically existing\n\n18:03.460 --> 18:04.420\n in the moment now.\n\n18:05.500 --> 18:06.660\n Yeah.\n\n18:06.660 --> 18:08.500\n Yeah, and what's another one?\n\n18:08.500 --> 18:09.740\n So we were debating this the other day.\n\n18:09.740 --> 18:14.420\n So if you think about a universe that has nothing in it,\n\n18:14.420 --> 18:16.100\n that's kind of hard to conceive of, right?\n\n18:16.100 --> 18:18.380\n Because, and this is where physicists really go wrong.\n\n18:18.380 --> 18:20.900\n They think of a universe with nothing in it, they can't.\n\n18:20.900 --> 18:21.740\n And you think.\n\n18:21.740 --> 18:22.940\n But nonexistence is really hard to think.\n\n18:22.940 --> 18:23.780\n Nonexistence, yeah.\n\n18:23.780 --> 18:26.940\n And then you think of a universe with everything in it,\n\n18:26.940 --> 18:28.020\n that's really hard.\n\n18:28.020 --> 18:30.380\n And you just have this white blob, right?\n\n18:30.380 --> 18:31.620\n It's just everything.\n\n18:31.620 --> 18:34.380\n But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe,\n\n18:34.380 --> 18:38.100\n Beyonce planets, so you've got stars, space, planet stuff,\n\n18:38.100 --> 18:41.900\n right, the boring stuff, but I would define life\n\n18:41.900 --> 18:46.300\n or say that life is where there are architectures,\n\n18:46.300 --> 18:48.380\n any architectures, and we should stop fixating\n\n18:48.380 --> 18:52.340\n on what is building the architectures to start with.\n\n18:52.340 --> 18:55.340\n And the fact that the universe has discrete things\n\n18:55.340 --> 18:57.860\n and it is completely mind blowing.\n\n18:57.860 --> 19:01.060\n If you think about it for one second,\n\n19:01.060 --> 19:03.780\n the fact there's any objects at all,\n\n19:03.780 --> 19:07.660\n and there's, because for me, the object is a proxy\n\n19:07.660 --> 19:10.540\n for a machine that built it,\n\n19:10.540 --> 19:14.860\n some information being moved around,\n\n19:14.860 --> 19:18.700\n actuation, sensing, getting resource,\n\n19:18.700 --> 19:20.220\n and building these objects.\n\n19:20.220 --> 19:23.540\n So for me, everyone's been obsessing about the machine,\n\n19:23.540 --> 19:27.420\n but I'm like, forget the machine, let's see the objects.\n\n19:27.420 --> 19:30.260\n And I think in a way that assembly theory,\n\n19:30.260 --> 19:31.900\n we realized maybe a few months ago\n\n19:31.900 --> 19:35.620\n that assembly theory actually does account for the soul\n\n19:35.620 --> 19:37.860\n and the objects, not mystically like say,\n\n19:37.860 --> 19:39.500\n Sheldrake's morphic resonance,\n\n19:39.500 --> 19:42.940\n or Leibniz's monadology, seeing souls in things.\n\n19:42.940 --> 19:45.700\n But when you see an object, and I've said this before,\n\n19:45.700 --> 19:49.260\n but this object is evidence of thought,\n\n19:49.260 --> 19:51.300\n and then there's a lineage of those objects.\n\n19:51.300 --> 19:54.500\n So I think what is fascinating is that,\n\n19:54.500 --> 19:55.820\n you put it much more elegantly,\n\n19:55.820 --> 19:58.500\n but the barrier between life and non life\n\n19:58.500 --> 20:01.540\n is accruing enough memories to then actuate.\n\n20:01.540 --> 20:04.860\n So what that means is there are contingency,\n\n20:04.860 --> 20:06.740\n there are things that happen in the universe get trapped,\n\n20:06.740 --> 20:10.140\n these memories then have a causal effect on the future.\n\n20:10.140 --> 20:12.540\n And then when you get those concentrated in a machine,\n\n20:12.540 --> 20:14.260\n and you're actually able in real time,\n\n20:14.260 --> 20:19.260\n able to integrate the past, the present with the future,\n\n20:19.260 --> 20:21.620\n and do stuff, that's when you are most alive.\n\n20:22.620 --> 20:23.820\n You being the machine.\n\n20:23.820 --> 20:24.660\n Yes.\n\n20:24.660 --> 20:26.980\n Wait a minute, why is the object,\n\n20:26.980 --> 20:29.380\n so one of the ways to define life,\n\n20:29.380 --> 20:31.700\n that Sarah said, is simple machines\n\n20:31.700 --> 20:34.180\n creating complex machines.\n\n20:34.180 --> 20:37.340\n So there's a million questions there.\n\n20:37.340 --> 20:39.540\n So how the hell does a simple machine\n\n20:39.540 --> 20:41.260\n create a complex machine?\n\n20:41.260 --> 20:42.860\n By mutation.\n\n20:42.860 --> 20:44.260\n So this is what we were talking about at the beginning,\n\n20:44.260 --> 20:46.180\n is you have the minimum replicator, so a molecule.\n\n20:46.180 --> 20:47.740\n So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah\n\n20:47.740 --> 20:49.780\n of the mechanism get there years ago, I think,\n\n20:49.780 --> 20:52.580\n but then you've been building on it and saying,\n\n20:52.580 --> 20:55.780\n you have a molecule that can copy itself,\n\n20:55.780 --> 20:58.300\n but then there has to be some variability,\n\n20:58.300 --> 21:00.340\n otherwise it's not gonna get more functional.\n\n21:00.340 --> 21:02.180\n So you need to add bits on.\n\n21:02.180 --> 21:04.700\n So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself,\n\n21:04.700 --> 21:05.820\n but then it can add bits on,\n\n21:05.820 --> 21:07.140\n and that can be copied as well,\n\n21:07.140 --> 21:09.980\n and those add ons can give you additional function,\n\n21:12.500 --> 21:15.780\n to be able to acquire more stuff to exist.\n\n21:15.780 --> 21:18.260\n So existence is weird,\n\n21:18.260 --> 21:21.180\n but the fact that there is existence is why there is life,\n\n21:21.180 --> 21:23.660\n and that's why I realized a few days ago\n\n21:23.660 --> 21:25.420\n that there must be, that's why alien life\n\n21:25.420 --> 21:28.780\n must be everywhere, because there is existence.\n\n21:28.780 --> 21:33.700\n Is there a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?\n\n21:33.700 --> 21:37.220\n So how can you keep injecting more complex things?\n\n21:38.860 --> 21:41.300\n Doesn't the machine that creates the object\n\n21:41.300 --> 21:46.300\n need to be as or more powerful than the things it creates?\n\n21:48.420 --> 21:51.740\n So how can you get complexity from simplicity?\n\n21:51.740 --> 21:54.860\n So the way you get complexity from simplicity\n\n21:54.860 --> 21:57.660\n is that you, I'm just making this up,\n\n21:57.660 --> 21:59.020\n but this is kind of my notion,\n\n21:59.020 --> 22:00.420\n and you have a large volume of stuff,\n\n22:00.420 --> 22:03.420\n so you're able to get seeds, if you like,\n\n22:03.420 --> 22:05.660\n random cues from the environment.\n\n22:05.660 --> 22:07.460\n So you just use those objects\n\n22:07.460 --> 22:11.740\n to basically write on your tape, ones and zeros, whatever.\n\n22:11.740 --> 22:16.740\n And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay?\n\n22:17.700 --> 22:19.660\n But it has a low assembliness,\n\n22:19.660 --> 22:21.380\n but even though it has a high assembly number,\n\n22:21.380 --> 22:22.580\n we can talk about that.\n\n22:22.580 --> 22:24.300\n But then when you start to then integrate\n\n22:24.300 --> 22:28.700\n that all into a smaller volume, as over time,\n\n22:28.700 --> 22:31.220\n and you become more autonomous,\n\n22:31.220 --> 22:33.020\n you then make the transition.\n\n22:33.020 --> 22:34.740\n I don't know what you think about that.\n\n22:34.740 --> 22:38.900\n I think the easiest way to think about it is actually,\n\n22:38.900 --> 22:40.900\n which I know is a concept you hate, but I also hate,\n\n22:40.900 --> 22:43.220\n which is entropy, but people are more familiar with entropy\n\n22:43.220 --> 22:45.380\n than what we talk about in assembly theory.\n\n22:45.380 --> 22:50.020\n And also the idea that, like, say physics as we know it\n\n22:50.020 --> 22:52.740\n involves objects that don't exist across time,\n\n22:52.740 --> 22:55.660\n or as we would say, low memory objects.\n\n22:55.660 --> 22:58.380\n So one of the key distinctions that is...\n\n22:58.380 --> 22:59.700\n Low memory objects.\n\n22:59.700 --> 23:01.220\n Yeah, so physics is all...\n\n23:01.220 --> 23:02.660\n Physicists are low memory objects.\n\n23:02.660 --> 23:05.020\n Low memory objects.\n\n23:05.020 --> 23:08.060\n Physicists are creators of low memory objects\n\n23:08.060 --> 23:10.220\n or manipulators of low memory objects.\n\n23:10.220 --> 23:11.060\n Absolutely.\n\n23:11.060 --> 23:13.180\n It's a very nice way of putting it.\n\n23:13.180 --> 23:14.020\n Okay, sorry, go ahead.\n\n23:14.020 --> 23:14.860\n Yeah, no, it's okay.\n\n23:14.860 --> 23:15.700\n Sorry to keep interrupting.\n\n23:15.700 --> 23:16.780\n No, no, no, it's fine.\n\n23:16.780 --> 23:18.820\n I like it too, it's very funny.\n\n23:18.820 --> 23:20.380\n But I think it's a good way of phrasing it\n\n23:20.380 --> 23:22.260\n because I think this kind of idea we have\n\n23:22.260 --> 23:25.420\n in assembly theory is that, you know,\n\n23:25.420 --> 23:27.580\n physics as we know it has basically removed time\n\n23:27.580 --> 23:31.340\n as being a physical observable of an object.\n\n23:31.340 --> 23:33.580\n And the argument I would make is that\n\n23:33.580 --> 23:36.100\n when you look at things like water bottles or us,\n\n23:36.100 --> 23:38.340\n we're actually things that exist\n\n23:38.340 --> 23:40.940\n that have a large extent in time.\n\n23:40.940 --> 23:44.380\n So we actually have a physical size and time,\n\n23:44.380 --> 23:46.540\n and we measure that with something called\n\n23:46.540 --> 23:49.460\n the assembly index in molecules,\n\n23:49.460 --> 23:53.220\n but presumably everyone should have sort of a,\n\n23:53.220 --> 23:54.940\n do you want to explain what assembly?\n\n23:54.940 --> 23:56.380\n Yeah, let's, you know what?\n\n23:56.380 --> 23:59.500\n Let's step back and start at the beginning.\n\n23:59.500 --> 24:01.020\n What is assembly theory?\n\n24:01.020 --> 24:02.140\n Lee sent me some slides.\n\n24:02.140 --> 24:05.940\n There's a big sexy paper coming out probably.\n\n24:05.940 --> 24:07.420\n Maybe, I don't know.\n\n24:07.420 --> 24:08.740\n We've almost finished it.\n\n24:10.180 --> 24:11.500\n Almost, almost finished it.\n\n24:11.500 --> 24:13.540\n That's also a summary of science.\n\n24:13.540 --> 24:14.740\n We're almost done.\n\n24:14.740 --> 24:15.580\n Yes.\n\n24:15.580 --> 24:16.420\n Well, no, no, we're almost done.\n\n24:16.420 --> 24:17.580\n It's the history of science.\n\n24:17.580 --> 24:20.460\n We are ready to start an interesting discussion\n\n24:20.460 --> 24:21.820\n with our peers.\n\n24:21.820 --> 24:22.660\n Right.\n\n24:22.660 --> 24:24.260\n You're the machine that created the object,\n\n24:24.260 --> 24:26.220\n and we'll see what the object takes us.\n\n24:26.220 --> 24:29.020\n All right, so what is assembly theory?\n\n24:29.020 --> 24:30.780\n Yeah, well, I think the easiest way\n\n24:30.780 --> 24:33.780\n for people to understand it is to think about\n\n24:33.780 --> 24:35.020\n assembly and molecules,\n\n24:35.020 --> 24:36.540\n although the theory is very general.\n\n24:36.540 --> 24:38.140\n It doesn't just apply to molecules.\n\n24:38.140 --> 24:39.460\n And this was really Lee's insight,\n\n24:39.460 --> 24:42.260\n so it's kind of funny that I'm explaining it, but.\n\n24:42.260 --> 24:43.300\n I'll mark you.\n\n24:43.300 --> 24:45.620\n Okay, all right, I'm ready, I'm ready.\n\n24:45.620 --> 24:47.460\n You have to tell me where I get the check marks minus,\n\n24:47.460 --> 24:48.300\n but.\n\n24:48.300 --> 24:49.140\n It's your theory as well.\n\n24:49.140 --> 24:49.980\n Yeah, I know.\n\n24:49.980 --> 24:51.740\n But imagine a molecule,\n\n24:51.740 --> 24:54.380\n and then you can break the molecule apart\n\n24:54.380 --> 24:55.820\n into elementary building blocks.\n\n24:55.820 --> 24:57.100\n They happen to be bonds.\n\n24:57.100 --> 24:58.660\n And then you can think of all the ways,\n\n24:58.660 --> 24:59.900\n for molecular assembly theory,\n\n24:59.900 --> 25:00.820\n you can think of all the ways\n\n25:00.820 --> 25:02.380\n of building up the original molecule.\n\n25:02.380 --> 25:04.980\n So there's all these paths that you can assemble it.\n\n25:04.980 --> 25:06.740\n And the sort of rules of assembly is\n\n25:06.740 --> 25:09.460\n you can use pieces that have been generated already.\n\n25:09.460 --> 25:11.900\n So it has this kind of recursive property to it.\n\n25:11.900 --> 25:13.580\n And so that's where kind of memory\n\n25:13.580 --> 25:15.100\n comes into assembly theory.\n\n25:15.100 --> 25:17.740\n And then the assembly index is\n\n25:17.740 --> 25:19.460\n the shortest path in that space.\n\n25:19.460 --> 25:21.820\n So it's supposed to be the minimal amount of history\n\n25:21.820 --> 25:23.300\n that the universe has to undergo\n\n25:23.300 --> 25:25.580\n in order to assemble that particular object.\n\n25:25.580 --> 25:27.900\n And the reason that this is significant is\n\n25:27.900 --> 25:29.660\n we figured out how to measure that\n\n25:30.580 --> 25:33.300\n with a mass spec in the lab.\n\n25:33.300 --> 25:35.340\n And we had this conjecture\n\n25:35.340 --> 25:36.940\n that if that minimal number of steps\n\n25:36.940 --> 25:38.540\n was sufficiently large,\n\n25:38.540 --> 25:40.500\n it would indicate that you required a machine\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:41.740\n or a system that had information\n\n25:41.740 --> 25:43.380\n about how to assemble that specific object\n\n25:43.380 --> 25:45.180\n because the combinatorial space of possibilities\n\n25:45.180 --> 25:47.340\n is getting exponentially large\n\n25:47.340 --> 25:49.100\n as the assembly index is increasing.\n\n25:49.100 --> 25:50.860\n So it's just, sorry to interrupt,\n\n25:50.860 --> 25:54.780\n so that means there's a sufficiently high assembly index\n\n25:55.820 --> 25:59.660\n that if observed in an object\n\n25:59.660 --> 26:04.460\n is an indicator that something lifelike created it\n\n26:04.460 --> 26:07.500\n or is the object itself lifelike?\n\n26:07.500 --> 26:08.540\n Both.\n\n26:08.540 --> 26:10.100\n But you might want to make the distinction\n\n26:10.100 --> 26:12.580\n that a water bottle is not life,\n\n26:12.580 --> 26:14.660\n but it would still be a signature\n\n26:14.660 --> 26:16.660\n that you were in that domain of physics\n\n26:16.660 --> 26:18.020\n and that I might be alive.\n\n26:19.900 --> 26:22.140\n So there will be potentially a lot of arguments\n\n26:22.140 --> 26:25.620\n about where the line, at which assembly index\n\n26:26.820 --> 26:28.860\n does interesting stuff start to happen.\n\n26:28.860 --> 26:30.620\n The point is we can make all the arguments,\n\n26:30.620 --> 26:32.260\n but it should be experimentally observable\n\n26:32.260 --> 26:34.220\n and Lee can talk more about that part of it.\n\n26:34.220 --> 26:36.620\n But the point I want to make about it is\n\n26:36.620 --> 26:39.180\n there was always this intuition that I had\n\n26:39.180 --> 26:41.260\n that there should be some complexity threshold\n\n26:41.260 --> 26:44.060\n in the universe above which you would start to say\n\n26:44.060 --> 26:46.900\n whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative.\n\n26:46.900 --> 26:48.140\n And I think about it a little bit\n\n26:48.140 --> 26:50.460\n like we have Planck's constant,\n\n26:50.460 --> 26:52.420\n and we have the fine structure constant.\n\n26:52.420 --> 26:54.700\n And then this sort of assembly threshold\n\n26:54.700 --> 26:59.700\n is basically another sort of potentially constant of nature.\n\n26:59.940 --> 27:02.420\n It might depend on the specific features of the system,\n\n27:02.420 --> 27:04.580\n but which we debate about sometimes.\n\n27:04.580 --> 27:07.780\n But then when you're past that,\n\n27:07.780 --> 27:10.140\n you have to have some other explanation\n\n27:10.140 --> 27:11.700\n than the current explanations we have in physics,\n\n27:11.700 --> 27:13.340\n because now you're in high memory.\n\n27:15.140 --> 27:18.460\n The things actually require time for them to exist\n\n27:18.460 --> 27:20.260\n and time becomes a physical variable.\n\n27:20.260 --> 27:23.780\n The path to the creation of the object is the memory.\n\n27:23.780 --> 27:25.780\n So you need to consider that.\n\n27:25.780 --> 27:29.540\n Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object.\n\n27:29.540 --> 27:33.540\n So when I think of all the things in this room,\n\n27:34.580 --> 27:37.580\n we see the projection of them as a water bottle,\n\n27:37.580 --> 27:39.940\n but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph\n\n27:39.940 --> 27:41.820\n of all the ways the universe can create this thing.\n\n27:41.820 --> 27:43.460\n That's what it is as an object.\n\n27:43.460 --> 27:45.620\n And we're all interacting, a causal graph.\n\n27:45.620 --> 27:47.460\n And most of the creativity in the biosphere\n\n27:47.460 --> 27:50.020\n is because a lot of the objects that exist now\n\n27:50.020 --> 27:52.660\n are huge in their structure across time.\n\n27:52.660 --> 27:55.420\n Four billion years of evolution to get to us.\n\n27:55.420 --> 27:57.580\n Is it possible to look at me\n\n27:57.580 --> 28:01.500\n and infer the history that led to me?\n\n28:01.500 --> 28:04.940\n If you, you as an individual might be hard.\n\n28:04.940 --> 28:09.180\n You as a representative of a population of objects\n\n28:09.180 --> 28:10.220\n that have high assembly\n\n28:10.220 --> 28:12.340\n with similar causal history and structure\n\n28:12.340 --> 28:14.740\n that you can communicate with, i.e. other humans,\n\n28:14.740 --> 28:15.820\n you can infer a lot probably.\n\n28:15.820 --> 28:17.020\n Yeah, also with them.\n\n28:17.020 --> 28:18.380\n Which we do genomically even.\n\n28:18.380 --> 28:19.580\n I mean, it's not like,\n\n28:19.580 --> 28:21.060\n we have a lot of information in us,\n\n28:21.060 --> 28:23.100\n we can reconstruct histories from.\n\n28:23.100 --> 28:24.660\n Assembly is saying something slightly deeper.\n\n28:24.660 --> 28:25.540\n Yeah, one thing to add.\n\n28:25.540 --> 28:26.980\n I mean, it's not just about the object,\n\n28:26.980 --> 28:28.140\n but the objects occur\n\n28:28.140 --> 28:30.260\n and not just objects with high assembly number,\n\n28:30.260 --> 28:32.180\n because you can have random things\n\n28:32.180 --> 28:33.020\n that have a high assembly number,\n\n28:33.020 --> 28:34.260\n but they must have,\n\n28:34.260 --> 28:36.500\n there must be a number of identical copies.\n\n28:36.500 --> 28:38.940\n So you know you're getting away from the random,\n\n28:38.940 --> 28:40.180\n because you could take a snapshot.\n\n28:40.180 --> 28:42.140\n This is why, it's not I hate entropy,\n\n28:42.140 --> 28:44.420\n I love entropy when used correctly,\n\n28:44.420 --> 28:46.140\n but it's about the problem of entropy,\n\n28:46.140 --> 28:47.740\n you have to have a labeler.\n\n28:47.740 --> 28:50.700\n And so you can label the beginning and the end,\n\n28:50.700 --> 28:52.340\n the start and the finish, you know,\n\n28:52.340 --> 28:53.820\n where what you can do in assembly is say,\n\n28:53.820 --> 28:56.460\n oh, I have a number of objects in abundance.\n\n28:56.460 --> 28:58.100\n They all have these features.\n\n28:58.100 --> 28:59.980\n And then you can infer.\n\n28:59.980 --> 29:01.860\n And one of the things that we debated a lot,\n\n29:01.860 --> 29:02.940\n particularly during lockdown,\n\n29:02.940 --> 29:05.500\n because I almost went insane trying to crush the,\n\n29:05.500 --> 29:06.860\n produce the assembly equation.\n\n29:06.860 --> 29:08.460\n So we came up with the assembly equation.\n\n29:08.460 --> 29:09.980\n I had, just imagine this.\n\n29:09.980 --> 29:12.100\n So you have a string where,\n\n29:13.860 --> 29:16.060\n actually it makes me sick trying to remember it.\n\n29:16.060 --> 29:18.580\n It was so, it did my head in for a long time.\n\n29:18.580 --> 29:21.700\n Yeah, because I couldn't,\n\n29:21.700 --> 29:23.900\n so if you just have a string of say words,\n\n29:23.900 --> 29:27.060\n say, you know, a series of words, series of letters.\n\n29:27.060 --> 29:29.940\n So you just have A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D.\n\n29:29.940 --> 29:32.500\n And you find that object and you just have four A's,\n\n29:32.500 --> 29:35.340\n four B's, four C's, four D's together, boom.\n\n29:35.340 --> 29:38.060\n Then, and that you measured that.\n\n29:38.060 --> 29:40.700\n So you physically measured that string of letters.\n\n29:40.700 --> 29:44.260\n Then what you could do is you can infer sub graphs\n\n29:44.260 --> 29:46.740\n of maybe the four A's, the four B's,\n\n29:46.740 --> 29:47.780\n the four C's and the four C's,\n\n29:47.780 --> 29:50.060\n but you don't see them in the real world.\n\n29:50.060 --> 29:51.300\n You just infer them.\n\n29:51.300 --> 29:53.860\n And I really got stuck with that\n\n29:53.860 --> 29:55.740\n because there's a problem to try and work out\n\n29:55.740 --> 29:57.700\n what's the difference between a long,\n\n29:57.700 --> 29:59.660\n you know, a physical object\n\n29:59.660 --> 30:01.460\n and this assembly space of the objects\n\n30:01.460 --> 30:05.780\n that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time.\n\n30:05.780 --> 30:08.140\n So although we can't infer your entire history,\n\n30:08.140 --> 30:10.460\n we know at some point the four A's were made,\n\n30:10.460 --> 30:12.580\n the four B's was made, the four C's were made,\n\n30:12.580 --> 30:15.500\n the four D's were made and they all got added together.\n\n30:15.500 --> 30:17.620\n And that's one really interesting thing\n\n30:17.620 --> 30:19.060\n that's come out of the theory,\n\n30:19.060 --> 30:21.820\n but the killer when we knew we were going beyond\n\n30:24.140 --> 30:26.380\n beyond standard complexity theories,\n\n30:26.380 --> 30:29.940\n but incredibly successful is that we realized\n\n30:29.940 --> 30:31.460\n we could start to measure these things\n\n30:31.460 --> 30:33.420\n for real across domains.\n\n30:33.420 --> 30:36.660\n So the assembly index is actually an intrinsic property\n\n30:36.660 --> 30:40.700\n of all stuff that you can break into components,\n\n30:41.700 --> 30:42.980\n particularly molecules are good\n\n30:42.980 --> 30:44.300\n because you can break them up\n\n30:44.300 --> 30:47.220\n into smaller molecules, into atoms.\n\n30:47.220 --> 30:49.900\n The challenge will be making that more general\n\n30:49.900 --> 30:50.740\n across all the domains,\n\n30:50.740 --> 30:51.820\n but we're working on it right now\n\n30:51.820 --> 30:53.020\n and I think the theory will do that.\n\n30:53.020 --> 30:54.780\n So components, domains,\n\n30:54.780 --> 30:58.140\n so you're talking about basically measuring\n\n30:58.140 --> 31:00.940\n the complexity of an object in what,\n\n31:00.940 --> 31:03.260\n biology, chemistry, physics,\n\n31:03.260 --> 31:04.860\n that's what you mean by domains.\n\n31:05.860 --> 31:06.700\n Complexity of tests.\n\n31:06.700 --> 31:08.140\n Sociology. Complexity of computers.\n\n31:08.140 --> 31:10.220\n Complexity of memes, you know.\n\n31:10.220 --> 31:11.660\n Memes? Yep.\n\n31:11.660 --> 31:13.260\n What is that, ideas?\n\n31:13.260 --> 31:15.220\n Yeah, I mean, so one of the.\n\n31:15.220 --> 31:16.980\n Ideas are objects in assembly theory.\n\n31:16.980 --> 31:17.820\n Yeah. They are.\n\n31:17.820 --> 31:18.980\n They're physical things.\n\n31:18.980 --> 31:20.340\n They're just features of the causal graph.\n\n31:20.340 --> 31:22.140\n I mean, the fact that I can talk to you right now\n\n31:22.140 --> 31:23.780\n is because we're exchanging structure\n\n31:23.780 --> 31:24.940\n of our assembly space.\n\n31:27.220 --> 31:32.220\n So conversation is the exchanging structures\n\n31:32.220 --> 31:33.180\n in assembly space.\n\n31:33.180 --> 31:34.940\n What is assembly space?\n\n31:34.940 --> 31:36.620\n When I started working on origins of life,\n\n31:36.620 --> 31:39.580\n I was writing about something called top down causation,\n\n31:39.580 --> 31:42.140\n which a lot of like philosophers are interested in\n\n31:42.140 --> 31:44.020\n and people that worry about the mind body problem.\n\n31:44.020 --> 31:45.900\n But the whole idea is, you know,\n\n31:45.900 --> 31:49.700\n if we have, you know, the microscopic world of physics\n\n31:49.700 --> 31:50.900\n is causally complete,\n\n31:50.900 --> 31:53.300\n it seems like there's no room for higher level causes\n\n31:53.300 --> 31:56.380\n like our thoughts to actually have any impact on the world.\n\n31:56.380 --> 31:59.140\n And that didn't, that seems problematic\n\n31:59.140 --> 32:01.300\n when you get to studying life and mind\n\n32:01.300 --> 32:03.420\n because it does seem that quote unquote,\n\n32:03.420 --> 32:05.460\n emergent properties do matter to matter.\n\n32:08.820 --> 32:10.980\n And then there's this other sort of paradoxical situation\n\n32:10.980 --> 32:12.940\n where information looks like it's disembodied.\n\n32:12.940 --> 32:14.260\n So we talk about information,\n\n32:14.260 --> 32:16.180\n like it can just move from any physical system\n\n32:16.180 --> 32:17.500\n to any other physical system.\n\n32:17.500 --> 32:19.260\n And it doesn't require,\n\n32:20.300 --> 32:22.580\n like you don't have to specify anything about the substrate\n\n32:22.580 --> 32:24.180\n to talk about information.\n\n32:24.180 --> 32:27.260\n And then there's also the way we talk about mathematics\n\n32:27.260 --> 32:28.660\n is also disembodied, right?\n\n32:28.660 --> 32:31.020\n Like the platonic world of forms\n\n32:31.020 --> 32:34.940\n and I think all of those things are hinging\n\n32:34.940 --> 32:37.100\n that we really don't know how to think about abstractions\n\n32:37.100 --> 32:38.380\n as physical things.\n\n32:39.580 --> 32:43.900\n And really, I think what assembly theory is pointing to\n\n32:43.900 --> 32:46.940\n is what we're missing there is the dimension of time.\n\n32:46.940 --> 32:48.900\n And if you actually look at an object\n\n32:48.900 --> 32:51.100\n being extended across time,\n\n32:51.100 --> 32:54.220\n what we call information and the things that look abstract\n\n32:54.220 --> 32:55.580\n are things that are entangled\n\n32:55.580 --> 32:57.340\n in the histories of those objects.\n\n32:57.340 --> 32:59.900\n They're features of the overlapping assembly space.\n\n32:59.900 --> 33:02.540\n So they look abstract because they're not\n\n33:02.540 --> 33:05.260\n part of the current structure,\n\n33:05.260 --> 33:06.580\n but they're part of the structure\n\n33:06.580 --> 33:09.060\n if you thought about it as like the philosophical concept\n\n33:09.060 --> 33:11.620\n of a hyperobject, an object that's too big in time\n\n33:11.620 --> 33:13.740\n for us to actually to resolve.\n\n33:13.740 --> 33:15.860\n And so I think information is physical.\n\n33:15.860 --> 33:17.940\n It's just physical in time, not in space.\n\n33:18.940 --> 33:22.140\n Too hyperobject, too difficult for us to resolve.\n\n33:22.140 --> 33:26.060\n So we're supposed to think about of life\n\n33:26.060 --> 33:28.140\n as this thing that stretches through time\n\n33:28.140 --> 33:31.100\n and there's a causation chain that led to that thing.\n\n33:32.220 --> 33:34.380\n And then you're trying to measure something\n\n33:34.380 --> 33:36.900\n with the assembly index about properties of that.\n\n33:36.900 --> 33:39.340\n The assembly index is the ordering,\n\n33:39.340 --> 33:41.780\n like you could think of it as like a partial ordering\n\n33:41.780 --> 33:43.740\n of all the things that can happen.\n\n33:43.740 --> 33:46.780\n So in thermodynamics, we coarse grain things\n\n33:46.780 --> 33:48.100\n by temperature and pressure.\n\n33:48.100 --> 33:50.460\n In assembly theory, we coarse grain\n\n33:50.460 --> 33:52.260\n by the number of copies of an object\n\n33:52.260 --> 33:53.980\n and the assembly index, which is basically,\n\n33:53.980 --> 33:56.180\n if you think of the space of all possible things,\n\n33:56.180 --> 33:58.340\n it's like a depth of how far you've gone into that space\n\n33:58.340 --> 34:00.220\n and how much time was required to get there.\n\n34:00.220 --> 34:02.140\n In the shortest possible version.\n\n34:02.140 --> 34:03.780\n The shortest possible version.\n\n34:03.780 --> 34:07.500\n Not average, because can't you just 3D?\n\n34:07.500 --> 34:09.620\n You're gonna kill me with that question.\n\n34:09.620 --> 34:13.580\n Not 3D, can't you always 3D print the thing?\n\n34:13.580 --> 34:14.820\n Let's like stab him in the heart.\n\n34:14.820 --> 34:16.460\n No, because I had such a fight.\n\n34:16.460 --> 34:18.740\n So Sarah's team and my team are writing this paper\n\n34:18.740 --> 34:20.140\n at the moment and.\n\n34:20.140 --> 34:21.340\n It's so funny.\n\n34:21.340 --> 34:23.020\n I think we kind of share the, at the beginning,\n\n34:23.020 --> 34:23.980\n you were like, no, that's not right.\n\n34:23.980 --> 34:24.820\n Oh yeah, that's right.\n\n34:24.820 --> 34:25.900\n And we're doing this for a bit.\n\n34:25.900 --> 34:27.860\n And then the problem is when you build a theory\n\n34:27.860 --> 34:29.340\n and build the intuition,\n\n34:29.340 --> 34:31.700\n there's some certain features, right,\n\n34:31.700 --> 34:34.260\n of the theory that almost felt like\n\n34:34.260 --> 34:35.500\n I was being religious about saying,\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:37.020\n right, you have to do this.\n\n34:37.020 --> 34:40.380\n A good assembly theorist does this, does this, does this.\n\n34:40.380 --> 34:44.460\n And Sarah's postdoc, Daniel, and my postdoc, Abhishek,\n\n34:44.460 --> 34:45.300\n and they were both.\n\n34:45.300 --> 34:46.140\n They're both brilliant.\n\n34:46.140 --> 34:47.860\n They're brilliant, but they were like,\n\n34:47.860 --> 34:49.500\n no, we don't buy that.\n\n34:49.500 --> 34:52.380\n And I was like, it is, they were like,\n\n34:52.380 --> 34:55.180\n well, Lee, actually, I thought you were the first\n\n34:55.180 --> 34:56.620\n to say that, you know, you can't,\n\n34:56.620 --> 34:58.060\n if you can't explain it, it doesn't,\n\n34:58.060 --> 35:00.140\n and you can't do an experiment that doesn't exist.\n\n35:00.140 --> 35:00.980\n And that saved me.\n\n35:00.980 --> 35:01.980\n And I said to Abhishek,\n\n35:01.980 --> 35:03.420\n Abhishek's my postdoc in Glasgow,\n\n35:03.420 --> 35:06.220\n Daniel is Sarah's postdoc in ASU.\n\n35:06.220 --> 35:08.980\n I was like, I have the experimental data.\n\n35:08.980 --> 35:11.060\n So when I basically take the molecules\n\n35:11.060 --> 35:12.820\n and chop them up in the mass spec,\n\n35:12.820 --> 35:14.460\n the assembly number is never the average.\n\n35:14.460 --> 35:15.740\n It's always the shortest.\n\n35:15.740 --> 35:16.860\n It's an intrinsic property.\n\n35:16.860 --> 35:19.180\n And then the penny drop for Abhishek said, okay.\n\n35:19.180 --> 35:22.180\n So I had these things that we had to believe\n\n35:22.180 --> 35:23.340\n to start with or to trust,\n\n35:23.340 --> 35:24.780\n and then we'd done the math and it comes out.\n\n35:24.780 --> 35:26.940\n And they now have the shortest path, actually.\n\n35:26.940 --> 35:29.140\n It's up, it explains why the shortest path.\n\n35:29.140 --> 35:32.700\n Here's why the shortest path is important, not the average.\n\n35:32.700 --> 35:34.740\n The shortest path needs you to identify\n\n35:34.740 --> 35:37.100\n when the universe has basically got a memory,\n\n35:37.100 --> 35:38.060\n not an average.\n\n35:38.060 --> 35:40.260\n So what you want to be able to do is to say,\n\n35:40.260 --> 35:43.780\n what is the minimum number of features\n\n35:43.780 --> 35:45.500\n that I want to be able to see in the universe?\n\n35:45.500 --> 35:46.780\n When I find those features,\n\n35:46.780 --> 35:50.820\n I know the universe has had a coherent memory\n\n35:50.820 --> 35:53.460\n and is basically alive.\n\n35:53.460 --> 35:56.980\n And so that gives you the lower bound.\n\n35:56.980 --> 35:59.540\n So that's like, of course there's going to be other paths.\n\n35:59.540 --> 36:01.140\n We can be more ridiculous, right?\n\n36:01.140 --> 36:03.460\n We can have other parts, but it's just the minimum.\n\n36:03.460 --> 36:06.100\n So probabilistically at the beginning,\n\n36:06.100 --> 36:07.940\n because assembly theory was built\n\n36:07.940 --> 36:11.900\n as a measure for biosignatures, I needed to go there.\n\n36:11.900 --> 36:13.780\n And then I realized it was intrinsic.\n\n36:13.780 --> 36:15.740\n And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic\n\n36:15.740 --> 36:16.940\n and these hyperobjects were coming.\n\n36:16.940 --> 36:19.820\n And we were kind of fusing that notions together.\n\n36:19.820 --> 36:21.340\n And then the team were like, yeah,\n\n36:21.340 --> 36:25.780\n but if I have enough energy and I have enough resources,\n\n36:25.780 --> 36:27.060\n I might not take the shortest path.\n\n36:27.060 --> 36:28.020\n I might go a bit longer.\n\n36:28.020 --> 36:30.020\n I might take a really long path\n\n36:30.020 --> 36:33.180\n because it allows me then to do something else.\n\n36:33.180 --> 36:34.300\n So what you can do is, let's say\n\n36:34.300 --> 36:37.420\n I've got two different objects, A and B,\n\n36:37.420 --> 36:40.380\n and they both have different shortest paths to get them.\n\n36:40.380 --> 36:43.860\n But then if you want to make A and B together,\n\n36:43.860 --> 36:44.940\n they will have a compromise.\n\n36:44.940 --> 36:48.620\n So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average,\n\n36:48.620 --> 36:50.220\n but actually it's the shortest way\n\n36:50.220 --> 36:52.300\n you can make both A and B\n\n36:52.300 --> 36:54.700\n with a minimum amount of resource in time.\n\n36:54.700 --> 36:56.860\n So suddenly you then layer these things up.\n\n36:56.860 --> 36:59.780\n And so the average becomes not important,\n\n36:59.780 --> 37:03.740\n but as you literally overlap those sets,\n\n37:03.740 --> 37:05.340\n you get a new shortest path.\n\n37:05.340 --> 37:07.220\n And so what we realized time and time again\n\n37:07.220 --> 37:08.060\n when we're doing the math,\n\n37:08.060 --> 37:11.260\n the shortest path is intrinsic, is fundamental,\n\n37:11.260 --> 37:14.300\n and is measurable, which is kind of mind blowing.\n\n37:14.300 --> 37:17.380\n So what we're talking about, some basic ingredients,\n\n37:17.380 --> 37:20.580\n maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic ingredients\n\n37:20.580 --> 37:23.860\n could be and how many steps, when you say shortest path,\n\n37:23.860 --> 37:28.340\n how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients\n\n37:28.340 --> 37:31.140\n into the final meal.\n\n37:32.180 --> 37:35.660\n So how to make a, what's the shortest way to make a pizza?\n\n37:35.660 --> 37:36.500\n Or a pie.\n\n37:36.500 --> 37:37.340\n Or a pie.\n\n37:37.340 --> 37:38.180\n An apple pie.\n\n37:38.180 --> 37:39.020\n That's right.\n\n37:39.020 --> 37:40.340\n And a pizza and a pie together.\n\n37:40.340 --> 37:41.780\n Or a scratch.\n\n37:41.780 --> 37:43.380\n So there's a lot of ways.\n\n37:44.980 --> 37:46.180\n There's the shortest way,\n\n37:46.180 --> 37:48.940\n and then you take the full spectrum of ways\n\n37:48.940 --> 37:53.300\n and there's probably an average duration\n\n37:53.300 --> 37:55.500\n for a noob to make an apple pie.\n\n37:56.380 --> 37:58.340\n Is the average interesting still?\n\n37:58.340 --> 38:01.980\n If you measure the average length of the path\n\n38:01.980 --> 38:05.100\n to assemble a thing, does that tell you something\n\n38:05.100 --> 38:07.180\n about the way nature usually does it?\n\n38:08.620 --> 38:13.620\n Versus something fundamental about the object,\n\n38:13.900 --> 38:15.460\n which I think is what you're aiming at\n\n38:15.460 --> 38:16.420\n with the assembly index.\n\n38:16.420 --> 38:19.420\n Yeah, I mean, look, we all have to quantify things.\n\n38:19.420 --> 38:21.140\n The minimum path gives you the lower bounds.\n\n38:21.140 --> 38:22.340\n You know you're detecting something.\n\n38:22.340 --> 38:24.060\n You know you're inferring something.\n\n38:24.060 --> 38:26.900\n The average tells you about really how the objects\n\n38:26.900 --> 38:30.980\n are existing in the ecosystem or the technology.\n\n38:30.980 --> 38:34.780\n And there has to be more paths explored\n\n38:34.780 --> 38:39.780\n because then you can happen upon other memories\n\n38:39.980 --> 38:41.500\n and then condense them down.\n\n38:41.500 --> 38:44.020\n I'm not making too much sense, but if you look and say,\n\n38:44.020 --> 38:45.700\n let's just say, I mean, maybe we're gonna get\n\n38:45.700 --> 38:47.260\n to alien civilizations later, right?\n\n38:47.260 --> 38:49.540\n But I would argue very strongly\n\n38:49.540 --> 38:52.740\n that alien civilization A and alien civilization B,\n\n38:54.180 --> 38:55.660\n they're different assembly spaces.\n\n38:55.660 --> 38:57.140\n So they're kind of gonna be a bit messed up\n\n38:57.140 --> 38:59.060\n if they happen to come one another,\n\n38:59.060 --> 39:02.340\n only when they find some joint overlap in their technology,\n\n39:02.340 --> 39:05.020\n because if aliens come to us and they don't share\n\n39:05.020 --> 39:06.620\n any of the causal graph we've showed,\n\n39:06.620 --> 39:09.220\n but hopefully they share the periodic table\n\n39:09.220 --> 39:11.460\n and bonds and things,\n\n39:11.460 --> 39:14.060\n that we're gonna have to really think about the language\n\n39:14.060 --> 39:16.860\n to talk to us aliens by inferring,\n\n39:16.860 --> 39:21.700\n by using assembly theory to infer their language,\n\n39:21.700 --> 39:23.780\n their technology, and other bits and bobs.\n\n39:23.780 --> 39:26.140\n And the shortest path will help you do that quickly.\n\n39:26.140 --> 39:29.540\n All right, so all aliens in this causality graphs\n\n39:29.540 --> 39:32.220\n have a common ancestor in the...\n\n39:32.220 --> 39:33.980\n If the building blocks are the same,\n\n39:33.980 --> 39:35.700\n which means they live in the same universe as us.\n\n39:35.700 --> 39:36.540\n So this is the assumption.\n\n39:36.540 --> 39:38.580\n It depends on how far back in time you go, though.\n\n39:38.580 --> 39:42.060\n But the universe has all the same building blocks.\n\n39:42.060 --> 39:42.900\n Yeah.\n\n39:42.900 --> 39:44.540\n And we have to assume that.\n\n39:45.740 --> 39:49.340\n So at least there's not different classes\n\n39:49.340 --> 39:53.060\n of causality graphs, right?\n\n39:53.060 --> 39:53.900\n No.\n\n39:53.900 --> 39:55.420\n The universe doesn't just say like,\n\n39:55.420 --> 39:58.420\n here you get the red causality graph,\n\n39:58.420 --> 39:59.420\n and you get the blue one.\n\n39:59.420 --> 40:00.780\n These basic ingredients,\n\n40:00.780 --> 40:02.740\n and they're geographically constrained,\n\n40:02.740 --> 40:06.100\n or constrained in space or time, or something like that.\n\n40:06.100 --> 40:07.300\n They're constrained in time\n\n40:07.300 --> 40:09.860\n because only by the virtue of the fact\n\n40:09.860 --> 40:12.820\n that you need enough time to have passed\n\n40:12.820 --> 40:14.580\n for some things to exist.\n\n40:14.580 --> 40:16.260\n So the universe has to be big enough in time\n\n40:16.260 --> 40:17.180\n for some things.\n\n40:17.180 --> 40:18.780\n So just one point on the shortest path\n\n40:18.780 --> 40:19.780\n versus the average path,\n\n40:19.780 --> 40:20.780\n which I think we'll get to this,\n\n40:20.780 --> 40:22.980\n is you had a nice way of saying it's like\n\n40:22.980 --> 40:25.180\n the minimal compression is the shortest path\n\n40:25.180 --> 40:26.620\n for the universe to produce that.\n\n40:26.620 --> 40:28.100\n But it's also like the first time\n\n40:28.100 --> 40:29.900\n in the ordering of events\n\n40:29.900 --> 40:32.500\n that you might expect to see that object.\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:35.780\n But the average path tells you something\n\n40:35.780 --> 40:39.100\n about the actual steps that were realized,\n\n40:39.100 --> 40:40.940\n and that becomes an emergent property\n\n40:40.940 --> 40:43.740\n of that object's interaction with other objects.\n\n40:43.740 --> 40:45.500\n So it's not an intrinsic feature of that object.\n\n40:45.500 --> 40:47.780\n It's a feature of the interactions with other things.\n\n40:47.780 --> 40:49.900\n And so one of the nice features of assembly\n\n40:49.900 --> 40:51.260\n is you've basically gotten rid of,\n\n40:51.260 --> 40:52.700\n you just look at the things that exist,\n\n40:52.700 --> 40:54.260\n and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms\n\n40:54.260 --> 40:56.260\n for constructing them in some sense.\n\n40:56.260 --> 41:00.780\n Like the machines are not as important\n\n41:00.780 --> 41:02.580\n in the current construction of the theory,\n\n41:02.580 --> 41:04.260\n although I would like to bridge it\n\n41:04.260 --> 41:06.580\n to some ideas about constructors.\n\n41:08.020 --> 41:11.260\n But then you can only communicate with things\n\n41:11.260 --> 41:12.500\n as Lee was saying,\n\n41:12.500 --> 41:15.020\n if you have some overlap in the past history.\n\n41:15.020 --> 41:16.900\n So if you had an alien species\n\n41:16.900 --> 41:18.780\n that had absolutely no overlap,\n\n41:18.780 --> 41:21.260\n then there would be no means of communication.\n\n41:21.260 --> 41:25.260\n But as we progress further and further in time\n\n41:25.260 --> 41:26.740\n and more things become possible\n\n41:26.740 --> 41:29.500\n because the assembly spaces are larger,\n\n41:29.500 --> 41:31.740\n because you can have a larger assembly space\n\n41:31.740 --> 41:34.180\n in terms of index and also just the size of the space,\n\n41:34.180 --> 41:36.300\n because it's exponentially growing,\n\n41:36.300 --> 41:38.100\n then more things can happen in the future.\n\n41:38.100 --> 41:40.580\n And the example I like to give is actually\n\n41:40.580 --> 41:43.700\n when we made first contact with gravitational waves,\n\n41:43.700 --> 41:46.060\n because that's an alien phenomenon\n\n41:46.060 --> 41:47.180\n that's been permeating our planet,\n\n41:47.180 --> 41:48.740\n not alien in life phenomenon,\n\n41:48.740 --> 41:51.900\n but alien like something we had never knew existed.\n\n41:51.900 --> 41:55.140\n It's been like there's gravitational waves\n\n41:55.140 --> 41:57.340\n rippling through this room right now,\n\n41:57.340 --> 42:00.180\n but we had to advance to the level of Einstein\n\n42:00.180 --> 42:03.100\n writing down his theory of relativity\n\n42:03.100 --> 42:05.820\n and then 100 years of technological development\n\n42:05.820 --> 42:08.540\n to even quote unquote see that phenomena.\n\n42:08.540 --> 42:12.060\n So the, okay, to see that phenomena,\n\n42:12.060 --> 42:16.020\n our causal graph have to start intersecting.\n\n42:16.020 --> 42:17.940\n Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first,\n\n42:17.940 --> 42:18.940\n the abstraction, right?\n\n42:18.940 --> 42:20.580\n And then we had to build the technology\n\n42:20.580 --> 42:23.740\n that could actually observe features of that abstraction.\n\n42:23.740 --> 42:26.500\n So the nice promising thing is over time,\n\n42:26.500 --> 42:29.460\n the graph can grow so we can start overlapping eventually.\n\n42:29.460 --> 42:31.380\n Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph\n\n42:31.380 --> 42:34.460\n is there was an event 1.4 billion years away\n\n42:34.460 --> 42:38.460\n of a black hole merger that we detected on our detector.\n\n42:38.460 --> 42:41.540\n And now suddenly we're connected\n\n42:41.540 --> 42:42.980\n through this communication channel\n\n42:42.980 --> 42:45.020\n with this distant event in our universe\n\n42:45.020 --> 42:48.020\n that if you think about 1.4 billion years ago,\n\n42:48.020 --> 42:49.260\n what was happening on this planet\n\n42:49.260 --> 42:51.020\n or even further back in time,\n\n42:51.900 --> 42:55.020\n that there's common physics underlying all of those events,\n\n42:55.020 --> 42:56.900\n but even for those two events to communicate.\n\n42:56.900 --> 42:58.300\n Now I understand what you were going on about\n\n42:58.300 --> 42:59.140\n the other week.\n\n42:59.140 --> 43:01.180\n Yeah, I'm sorry, this is a really abstract example,\n\n43:01.180 --> 43:03.140\n but it's sort of.\n\n43:03.140 --> 43:05.700\n Your causal graphs are now overlapping.\n\n43:05.700 --> 43:07.940\n Well, let's just say now our causal graphs\n\n43:07.940 --> 43:10.100\n are overlapping in the deep past.\n\n43:10.100 --> 43:10.940\n Yeah, sorry.\n\n43:10.940 --> 43:11.780\n No, I like it, so you made it.\n\n43:11.780 --> 43:12.600\n I totally missed it.\n\n43:12.600 --> 43:13.440\n Oh, the 1.6 billion.\n\n43:13.440 --> 43:14.280\n Yeah.\n\n43:14.280 --> 43:15.100\n You made a connection with it.\n\n43:15.100 --> 43:15.940\n No, I do like that.\n\n43:15.940 --> 43:17.540\n No, no, you can tell me what your epiphany is now.\n\n43:17.540 --> 43:18.420\n That's good.\n\n43:18.420 --> 43:19.260\n Because I was.\n\n43:19.260 --> 43:22.860\n And I should get the jokes before 30 seconds after, so.\n\n43:22.860 --> 43:23.980\n Oh, I get it now.\n\n43:25.100 --> 43:25.940\n No, it's all right.\n\n43:25.940 --> 43:26.780\n I was slow.\n\n43:26.780 --> 43:27.620\n The joke from two minutes ago.\n\n43:27.620 --> 43:28.660\n I'm slow on the uptake here.\n\n43:28.660 --> 43:29.900\n I wasn't able to comprehend\n\n43:29.900 --> 43:31.300\n what you were talking about when saying\n\n43:31.300 --> 43:32.900\n the channel communicating to the past.\n\n43:32.900 --> 43:36.460\n But what you're saying is we were able to infer\n\n43:36.460 --> 43:40.340\n what happened 1.4 billion years ago.\n\n43:40.340 --> 43:41.700\n We detected the gravity wave.\n\n43:41.700 --> 43:43.700\n I mean, I think it's amazing that at that time,\n\n43:43.700 --> 43:46.100\n we weren't even, we were just becoming multicellular,\n\n43:46.100 --> 43:46.940\n right?\n\n43:46.940 --> 43:48.460\n It's like insane.\n\n43:48.460 --> 43:51.780\n And then we progressed from multicellularity\n\n43:51.780 --> 43:55.380\n through to technology and built the detector\n\n43:55.380 --> 43:58.020\n and then we just extrapolate backwards.\n\n43:58.020 --> 44:01.580\n So, although we didn't do anything back to the graph\n\n44:01.580 --> 44:03.420\n back in time, we understood this existence\n\n44:03.420 --> 44:04.500\n then overlapped going forward.\n\n44:04.500 --> 44:05.340\n And that.\n\n44:05.340 --> 44:06.620\n Well, that's because our graphs are larger.\n\n44:06.620 --> 44:09.180\n Yeah, but that means that has a consequence.\n\n44:09.180 --> 44:13.780\n One of the things I was trying to say is I think,\n\n44:13.780 --> 44:15.860\n I don't know, Sarah might be, she can correct me,\n\n44:15.860 --> 44:19.660\n information first and I'm a object first kind of guy.\n\n44:19.660 --> 44:21.820\n So, I mean, there's things that get constructed.\n\n44:21.820 --> 44:25.340\n There has to be this transition in random constructions.\n\n44:25.340 --> 44:30.340\n So when the object that's being constructed by the process\n\n44:30.780 --> 44:33.580\n bakes in that memory and those memories then add on\n\n44:33.580 --> 44:35.500\n and add on and add on.\n\n44:35.500 --> 44:39.060\n So as it becomes more competent and life is about\n\n44:39.060 --> 44:41.020\n taking those memories and compressing them,\n\n44:41.020 --> 44:42.900\n increasing their autonomy.\n\n44:42.900 --> 44:46.300\n And so I think that, like the cell that we have\n\n44:46.300 --> 44:48.180\n in biology on earth is our way of doing that,\n\n44:48.180 --> 44:51.260\n that really the maximum ability to take memories\n\n44:51.260 --> 44:53.060\n and to act on the future.\n\n44:53.060 --> 44:55.620\n Oh, I think that's mathematics.\n\n44:55.620 --> 44:58.460\n No, mathematics doesn't exist.\n\n44:58.460 --> 44:59.500\n No, but that's the point.\n\n44:59.500 --> 45:01.940\n The point is that abstractions do exist.\n\n45:01.940 --> 45:03.100\n They're real physical things.\n\n45:03.100 --> 45:05.740\n We call them abstractions.\n\n45:05.740 --> 45:08.780\n But the point about mathematics that I think is,\n\n45:08.780 --> 45:11.780\n so I don't disagree that I think you're object first\n\n45:11.780 --> 45:14.060\n and I'm information first, but I think I'm only\n\n45:14.060 --> 45:16.460\n information first in the sense that I think the thing\n\n45:16.460 --> 45:20.500\n that we need to explain is what abstractions are\n\n45:20.500 --> 45:22.060\n and what they are as physical things\n\n45:22.060 --> 45:23.780\n because of all of human history,\n\n45:23.780 --> 45:25.660\n we've thought that there were these properties\n\n45:25.660 --> 45:29.500\n that are disembodied, exist outside of the universe\n\n45:29.500 --> 45:32.460\n and really they do exist in the universe\n\n45:32.460 --> 45:34.900\n and we just don't understand what their physics is.\n\n45:34.900 --> 45:36.780\n So I think mathematics is a really good example.\n\n45:36.780 --> 45:39.340\n We do theoretical physics with math,\n\n45:39.340 --> 45:42.580\n but imagine doing physics of math\n\n45:42.580 --> 45:44.860\n and then thinking about math as a physical object.\n\n45:44.860 --> 45:46.380\n And math is super interesting.\n\n45:46.380 --> 45:48.780\n I think this is why we think it describes reality so well\n\n45:48.780 --> 45:50.940\n because it's the most copyable kind of information.\n\n45:50.940 --> 45:52.380\n It retains its properties\n\n45:52.380 --> 45:54.220\n when you move it between physical media,\n\n45:54.220 --> 45:56.180\n which means that it's very deep.\n\n45:56.180 --> 45:59.180\n And so it seems to describe the universe really well,\n\n45:59.180 --> 46:00.500\n but it probably is because it's information\n\n46:00.500 --> 46:02.020\n that's very deep in our past.\n\n46:02.020 --> 46:06.460\n And it's just, we invented a way of communicating it\n\n46:06.460 --> 46:08.020\n very effectively between us.\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:11.180\n Isn't math more fundamental?\n\n46:11.180 --> 46:13.380\n Isn't the assembly of the graph,\n\n46:13.380 --> 46:16.260\n isn't basically, I sound completely boring.\n\n46:16.260 --> 46:20.020\n It's like math, assembly theory invented math, but it did.\n\n46:20.020 --> 46:20.860\n It has to be.\n\n46:20.860 --> 46:21.700\n Okay.\n\n46:23.860 --> 46:28.860\n So what is math exactly?\n\n46:28.940 --> 46:33.940\n It's a nice simplification,\n\n46:34.780 --> 46:38.060\n a simple description of what?\n\n46:38.060 --> 46:39.340\n So we have a computer scientist,\n\n46:39.340 --> 46:41.300\n a physicist, and a chemist here.\n\n46:41.300 --> 46:42.140\n Walking to a bar.\n\n46:42.140 --> 46:43.860\n I think the chemist is gonna define math\n\n46:43.860 --> 46:45.620\n and you guys can correct me.\n\n46:45.620 --> 46:46.500\n Go for it.\n\n46:46.500 --> 46:47.340\n I would say.\n\n46:47.340 --> 46:48.460\n Lay in on us, Lee.\n\n46:48.460 --> 46:50.900\n We're ready.\n\n46:50.900 --> 46:54.980\n I think the ability to label objects\n\n46:54.980 --> 46:57.420\n and place them into classes\n\n46:57.420 --> 47:00.020\n and then do operations on the objects is what math is.\n\n47:01.020 --> 47:02.380\n So on that point,\n\n47:02.380 --> 47:04.660\n what does it mean to be object first\n\n47:04.660 --> 47:07.020\n versus information first?\n\n47:07.020 --> 47:09.620\n So what's the difference between object and information\n\n47:09.620 --> 47:11.980\n when you get to that low fundamental level?\n\n47:11.980 --> 47:14.020\n Well, I might change my view.\n\n47:14.020 --> 47:16.460\n So I'm stuff first, the stuff.\n\n47:16.460 --> 47:18.780\n And then when stuff becomes objects,\n\n47:18.780 --> 47:21.460\n it has to invent information.\n\n47:21.460 --> 47:23.820\n And then the information acts on more stuff\n\n47:23.820 --> 47:24.860\n and becomes more objects.\n\n47:24.860 --> 47:27.700\n So I think there is a transition to information\n\n47:27.700 --> 47:29.780\n that occurs when you go from stuff to objects.\n\n47:29.780 --> 47:30.620\n You mean time though, I think.\n\n47:30.620 --> 47:31.460\n Yeah.\n\n47:31.460 --> 47:33.460\n Information is emergent.\n\n47:33.460 --> 47:34.380\n Not emergent.\n\n47:34.380 --> 47:39.380\n Information is actionable memories from the universe.\n\n47:40.420 --> 47:44.820\n So when memories become actionable, that's information.\n\n47:44.820 --> 47:48.300\n But there's always memory, but it's not actionable.\n\n47:48.300 --> 47:49.140\n Yeah.\n\n47:49.140 --> 47:49.980\n And then it's not information.\n\n47:49.980 --> 47:50.820\n Great.\n\n47:50.820 --> 47:52.340\n And actionable is what you can create.\n\n47:52.340 --> 47:53.660\n You can use it.\n\n47:53.660 --> 47:55.820\n If you can't use it, then it's not information.\n\n47:55.820 --> 47:56.900\n If you can't transmit it,\n\n47:56.900 --> 47:59.460\n if it doesn't have any causal consequence.\n\n47:59.460 --> 48:00.460\n Falls in the forest.\n\n48:00.460 --> 48:01.660\n I don't understand.\n\n48:01.660 --> 48:03.500\n Why is that not information?\n\n48:03.500 --> 48:04.460\n It's not information.\n\n48:04.460 --> 48:07.340\n It's stuff.\n\n48:07.340 --> 48:10.260\n It's stuff happening, but it's not causal.\n\n48:10.260 --> 48:11.700\n Yeah, yeah, we can.\n\n48:11.700 --> 48:12.540\n This is cool.\n\n48:12.540 --> 48:13.380\n But it's happening.\n\n48:13.380 --> 48:15.180\n Happening requires information.\n\n48:15.180 --> 48:16.860\n No, no, no, no, no.\n\n48:16.860 --> 48:18.260\n Stuff is always happening.\n\n48:18.260 --> 48:19.980\n No, this is where the physicists\n\n48:19.980 --> 48:21.740\n and the math petitions get themselves in a loop\n\n48:21.740 --> 48:24.620\n because I think the universe, I mean,\n\n48:24.620 --> 48:28.020\n I think say Max Tegmark is very playful\n\n48:28.020 --> 48:30.220\n and say like the universe is just math.\n\n48:30.220 --> 48:31.340\n Well, the universe is just math.\n\n48:31.340 --> 48:34.140\n Then we might as well not bother having any conversation\n\n48:34.140 --> 48:35.140\n because the conversation already written,\n\n48:35.140 --> 48:36.220\n we just might as well go to the future and say,\n\n48:36.220 --> 48:38.740\n can you just give us the conversations happened already?\n\n48:38.740 --> 48:41.420\n So I think the problem is that math petitions\n\n48:41.420 --> 48:43.460\n are so successful at labeling stuff\n\n48:43.460 --> 48:45.220\n and so successful understanding the stuff\n\n48:45.220 --> 48:46.300\n through those labels,\n\n48:46.300 --> 48:49.540\n they forget that actually those labels had to emerge\n\n48:49.540 --> 48:52.980\n and that information had to be built on those memories.\n\n48:52.980 --> 48:56.740\n So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph,\n\n48:56.740 --> 48:57.580\n when they become actionable\n\n48:57.580 --> 48:59.780\n and the graph can loop back on itself\n\n48:59.780 --> 49:02.820\n or interact with other graphs and they can intersect,\n\n49:02.820 --> 49:04.420\n those memories become actionable\n\n49:04.420 --> 49:05.940\n and therefore they're information.\n\n49:05.940 --> 49:09.180\n And I think you just changed my mind\n\n49:09.180 --> 49:11.060\n on something pretty big, but I don't have a pen.\n\n49:11.060 --> 49:12.460\n So I can't write, I'm gonna write it down later,\n\n49:12.460 --> 49:17.100\n but roughly the idea is like you've got these two graphs\n\n49:17.100 --> 49:20.540\n of objects of stuff that you have memories\n\n49:20.540 --> 49:22.460\n and then when they intersect\n\n49:22.460 --> 49:24.460\n and then they can act on each other,\n\n49:24.460 --> 49:27.540\n that's maybe the mechanism by which information is then,\n\n49:27.540 --> 49:29.300\n so then you can then abstract.\n\n49:29.300 --> 49:32.300\n So when one graph can then build another graph and say,\n\n49:32.300 --> 49:33.860\n hey, you don't have to go through the nonsense\n\n49:33.860 --> 49:34.700\n we had to go through.\n\n49:34.700 --> 49:36.100\n Here's literally the way to do it.\n\n49:36.100 --> 49:37.860\n Stuff always comes first,\n\n49:37.860 --> 49:39.500\n but then when stuff builds the abstraction,\n\n49:39.500 --> 49:41.260\n the abstractions can be then teleported\n\n49:41.260 --> 49:42.100\n onto other stuff.\n\n49:42.100 --> 49:45.020\n And the abstractions is the looping back power.\n\n49:45.020 --> 49:45.860\n Okay.\n\n49:45.860 --> 49:47.620\n Am I making, I don't know, I got stuck.\n\n49:47.620 --> 49:51.260\n Yeah, so first, God made stuff.\n\n49:52.300 --> 49:54.740\n Then after that, when you start to be able\n\n49:54.740 --> 49:56.980\n to form abstractions, that's when the information.\n\n49:56.980 --> 50:00.500\n God is the memory the universe can remember.\n\n50:00.500 --> 50:02.980\n God is the memory the universe can remember.\n\n50:02.980 --> 50:03.820\n Otherwise, there's no, wait, did you?\n\n50:03.820 --> 50:05.460\n Someone's gonna be deciphering that statement\n\n50:05.460 --> 50:07.900\n hundreds of years from now, what the hell does that mean?\n\n50:07.900 --> 50:09.660\n What does the humans mean by this?\n\n50:09.660 --> 50:12.660\n Look, don't diss my one liners.\n\n50:12.660 --> 50:16.660\n I took me 15 seconds to come up with that.\n\n50:16.660 --> 50:17.700\n I don't know what it means.\n\n50:17.700 --> 50:18.660\n What does it mean?\n\n50:19.700 --> 50:23.380\n Okay, wait, we need to, how do we get onto this?\n\n50:24.380 --> 50:29.380\n We were time, causality, mathematics.\n\n50:30.580 --> 50:34.540\n So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff,\n\n50:34.540 --> 50:39.540\n objects, memory, and information?\n\n50:43.180 --> 50:44.980\n What exactly is mathematics?\n\n50:44.980 --> 50:47.020\n It's the most efficient labeling scheme\n\n50:47.020 --> 50:49.540\n that you can apply to lots of different graphs.\n\n50:49.540 --> 50:52.420\n Labeling scheme doesn't make it sound useful.\n\n50:52.420 --> 50:53.380\n Can I try?\n\n50:53.380 --> 50:54.700\n Yep, sure, please.\n\n50:54.700 --> 50:56.780\n Have you rejected my definition of mathematics?\n\n50:56.780 --> 50:57.820\n I'm shocked.\n\n50:57.820 --> 50:59.260\n Yeah, no, it's all right.\n\n50:59.260 --> 51:00.100\n But it's correct.\n\n51:01.300 --> 51:02.140\n Go on, sorry.\n\n51:02.140 --> 51:03.420\n Excellent.\n\n51:03.420 --> 51:06.420\n No, I mean, I think we have a problem, right?\n\n51:06.420 --> 51:08.540\n Cause we can't not be us,\n\n51:08.540 --> 51:10.340\n like we're stuck in the shells we are\n\n51:10.340 --> 51:11.460\n and we're trying to observe the world.\n\n51:11.460 --> 51:13.820\n And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties.\n\n51:13.820 --> 51:16.180\n And I guess the thought experiment I find is useful\n\n51:16.180 --> 51:19.060\n is to try to imagine if you were outside of us\n\n51:19.060 --> 51:22.300\n looking at us as physical systems using mathematics,\n\n51:22.300 --> 51:24.900\n what would be the specific features you associate\n\n51:24.900 --> 51:28.820\n to the property of understanding mathematics\n\n51:28.820 --> 51:32.020\n and being able to implement it in the universe, right?\n\n51:32.020 --> 51:34.300\n And when you do that,\n\n51:34.300 --> 51:36.860\n mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties\n\n51:36.860 --> 51:39.180\n relative to other kinds of abstraction\n\n51:39.180 --> 51:42.820\n we might talk about like language or artistic expression.\n\n51:42.820 --> 51:45.140\n One of those properties is the one I mentioned already\n\n51:45.140 --> 51:48.060\n that is really easy to copy between physical media.\n\n51:48.060 --> 51:50.340\n So if I give you a mathematical statement,\n\n51:50.340 --> 51:51.900\n you almost immediately know what I mean.\n\n51:51.900 --> 51:53.100\n If I tell you the sky is blue,\n\n51:53.100 --> 51:54.860\n you might say, is it gold ball blue?\n\n51:54.860 --> 51:55.700\n Is it azure blue?\n\n51:55.700 --> 51:56.740\n What color blue do you mean?\n\n51:56.740 --> 52:00.260\n And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean.\n\n52:00.260 --> 52:01.940\n So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it\n\n52:01.940 --> 52:03.420\n when it's copied between physical systems.\n\n52:03.420 --> 52:06.900\n It's also the reason we use it to communicate with computers.\n\n52:06.900 --> 52:10.100\n And then the second one is it retains its property\n\n52:10.100 --> 52:13.780\n of actually what it can do in the universe when it's copied.\n\n52:13.780 --> 52:16.060\n So the example I like to give there\n\n52:16.060 --> 52:18.460\n is think about like Newton's law of gravitation.\n\n52:19.500 --> 52:22.100\n It's actually, it's a compressed regularity\n\n52:22.100 --> 52:25.460\n of a bunch of phenomena that we observe in the universe,\n\n52:25.460 --> 52:28.700\n but then that information actually is causal in a sense\n\n52:28.700 --> 52:30.500\n that it allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do\n\n52:30.500 --> 52:31.940\n without that particular knowledge\n\n52:31.940 --> 52:33.420\n and that particular abstraction.\n\n52:33.420 --> 52:35.180\n And in this case, like launch satellites to space\n\n52:35.180 --> 52:37.180\n or send people to Mars or whatever it is.\n\n52:38.180 --> 52:41.340\n So if you look at us from the outside and you say,\n\n52:41.340 --> 52:42.820\n what is it for physical systems\n\n52:42.820 --> 52:44.860\n to invent a thing called mathematics\n\n52:44.860 --> 52:49.860\n and then to use and then it to become a physical observable,\n\n52:51.300 --> 52:52.900\n mathematics is kind of like\n\n52:52.900 --> 52:55.580\n the universally copyable information\n\n52:55.580 --> 52:58.500\n that allows new possibility spaces\n\n52:58.500 --> 52:59.380\n to be open in the future\n\n52:59.380 --> 53:01.380\n because it allows this kind of ability\n\n53:01.380 --> 53:03.100\n to map one physical system to another\n\n53:03.100 --> 53:05.700\n and actually understand that the general principles.\n\n53:05.700 --> 53:10.660\n So is it helping the overlap of causal graphs then\n\n53:10.660 --> 53:11.620\n by mapping?\n\n53:11.620 --> 53:14.140\n Oh, I think that's the explanation for what it is\n\n53:14.140 --> 53:16.020\n in terms of the physical theory of assembly\n\n53:16.020 --> 53:18.220\n would be some feature of the structure\n\n53:18.220 --> 53:20.660\n of the assembly spaces of causal graphs\n\n53:20.660 --> 53:22.140\n and their relationship to each other.\n\n53:22.140 --> 53:25.420\n So for example, and I mean, this is things\n\n53:25.420 --> 53:27.220\n that we're gonna have to work out over the next few years.\n\n53:27.220 --> 53:29.540\n I mean, we're in totally uncharted conceptual territory\n\n53:29.540 --> 53:34.540\n here, but as is usual, diving off the deep end,\n\n53:35.380 --> 53:38.060\n but I would expect that we would be able to come up\n\n53:38.060 --> 53:40.740\n with a theory of like, why is it that some physical systems\n\n53:40.740 --> 53:43.100\n can communicate with each other?\n\n53:43.100 --> 53:45.420\n Like language, language is basically\n\n53:45.420 --> 53:47.220\n because we're objects extended over time\n\n53:47.220 --> 53:49.820\n and some of the history of that assembly space\n\n53:49.820 --> 53:51.060\n actually overlaps.\n\n53:51.060 --> 53:52.220\n And when we communicate,\n\n53:52.220 --> 53:53.780\n it's because we actually have shared structure\n\n53:53.780 --> 53:55.020\n in our causal history.\n\n53:55.020 --> 53:56.500\n Let me have another quick go at this, right?\n\n53:56.500 --> 53:57.420\n So I think we all agree.\n\n53:57.420 --> 54:01.460\n So I think we take mathematics for granted\n\n54:01.460 --> 54:02.940\n because we've gone through this chain, right?\n\n54:02.940 --> 54:06.460\n Of, you know, we all share a language now, okay?\n\n54:06.460 --> 54:07.660\n And we can, well, we share language,\n\n54:07.660 --> 54:11.460\n so we have languages that we can make interoperable.\n\n54:11.460 --> 54:14.940\n And so whether you're speaking, I don't know,\n\n54:14.940 --> 54:17.500\n all the different dialects of Chinese,\n\n54:17.500 --> 54:20.740\n all the different dialects of English, French, German,\n\n54:20.740 --> 54:22.780\n whatever, you can interconvert them.\n\n54:22.780 --> 54:24.300\n The interesting thing about mathematics now\n\n54:24.300 --> 54:26.540\n is that everybody on planet Earth, every human being\n\n54:26.540 --> 54:29.740\n and computers share that common language.\n\n54:29.740 --> 54:33.380\n That language was constructed by a process in time.\n\n54:33.380 --> 54:35.380\n So what I'm trying to say is assembly invented math\n\n54:35.380 --> 54:37.940\n is those, right from the, you know,\n\n54:37.940 --> 54:41.420\n mathematics didn't occur, it didn't exist before life.\n\n54:41.420 --> 54:44.100\n Abstraction was invented by life, right?\n\n54:44.100 --> 54:46.060\n That doesn't mean that the universe wasn't capable\n\n54:46.060 --> 54:47.300\n of mathematical things.\n\n54:47.300 --> 54:50.740\n Wait a minute, can we just ask that old famous question,\n\n54:50.740 --> 54:52.820\n is math invented or discovered?\n\n54:52.820 --> 54:56.700\n So when you say assembly invented, or whatever.\n\n54:58.020 --> 54:58.860\n It means it's just.\n\n54:58.860 --> 54:59.700\n Well, someone might just say assembly\n\n54:59.700 --> 55:01.500\n is a mathematical theory, but sorry.\n\n55:01.500 --> 55:02.340\n Right.\n\n55:02.340 --> 55:03.160\n Are we arguing? Exactly.\n\n55:03.160 --> 55:04.000\n Are we arguing now?\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:05.020\n That's what it sounds like.\n\n55:05.020 --> 55:06.940\n Are we discovering mathematics?\n\n55:06.940 --> 55:08.500\n No, well, yes and no.\n\n55:08.500 --> 55:09.340\n I would say.\n\n55:09.340 --> 55:11.940\n And you call mathematics a language\n\n55:11.940 --> 55:13.020\n that we're developing. I would say that,\n\n55:13.020 --> 55:17.060\n look, I'm pretty sure that there are some very common\n\n55:17.060 --> 55:19.820\n seeds of mathematics in the universe, right?\n\n55:19.820 --> 55:23.860\n But actually not the mathematics that we are finding now\n\n55:23.860 --> 55:27.220\n is not discovered, it's invented.\n\n55:27.220 --> 55:29.100\n And, but even though I think those two terms\n\n55:29.100 --> 55:30.460\n are very triggering, and I don't think\n\n55:30.460 --> 55:31.940\n they're necessarily useful,\n\n55:31.940 --> 55:33.860\n because I think that what people do,\n\n55:33.860 --> 55:38.100\n the mathematicians that say, oh, mathematics was discovered\n\n55:38.100 --> 55:40.620\n because they live in a universe where there is no time\n\n55:40.620 --> 55:42.500\n and it just all exists.\n\n55:42.500 --> 55:45.300\n But what I'm saying is, and I think in the same way\n\n55:45.300 --> 55:47.380\n you can create, let's say I'm gonna go and create\n\n55:47.380 --> 55:52.380\n and make a piece of art, did I make that piece of art\n\n55:53.740 --> 55:56.060\n or did I discover it?\n\n55:56.060 --> 55:57.460\n Like inventing the aeroplane.\n\n55:57.460 --> 55:58.780\n Did I invent the aeroplane?\n\n55:58.780 --> 55:59.620\n Let's stick with the aeroplane.\n\n55:59.620 --> 56:00.780\n The aeroplane is a good one.\n\n56:00.780 --> 56:03.180\n Let's say, did I discover the aeroplane?\n\n56:03.180 --> 56:04.860\n Well, in a way, the universe discovered the aeroplane\n\n56:04.860 --> 56:06.300\n because it's just chucked a load of atoms together\n\n56:06.300 --> 56:08.260\n and a load of random human beings want to do stuff\n\n56:08.260 --> 56:10.660\n and then we discover the aeroplane\n\n56:10.660 --> 56:12.180\n in the space of all the possibilities.\n\n56:12.180 --> 56:14.980\n But here's the thing, when the space of possibilities\n\n56:14.980 --> 56:19.980\n is so vast, infinite almost, and you're able to actualize\n\n56:21.700 --> 56:24.620\n one of those in an object, then you are inventing it.\n\n56:24.620 --> 56:27.140\n So in mathematics, because there are infinite number\n\n56:27.140 --> 56:29.420\n of theorems, the fact you're actually pulling,\n\n56:29.420 --> 56:31.540\n there's no difference between inventing\n\n56:31.540 --> 56:34.300\n a mathematical structure and inventing the aeroplane.\n\n56:34.300 --> 56:36.340\n They're the same thing, but that doesn't mean\n\n56:36.340 --> 56:38.500\n that now the aeroplane exists in the universe,\n\n56:38.500 --> 56:40.340\n it's something weird about the universe.\n\n56:40.340 --> 56:43.620\n So I think that the more, this is the thing\n\n56:43.620 --> 56:47.080\n that you probably, the more memory required\n\n56:47.080 --> 56:50.300\n for the object, the more invented it is.\n\n56:50.300 --> 56:54.340\n So when a mathematical theorem needs more bytes\n\n56:54.340 --> 56:56.780\n to store it, the more invented it is,\n\n56:56.780 --> 57:00.020\n and the less bytes, the more discovered it is.\n\n57:00.020 --> 57:02.060\n But everything then is invented.\n\n57:02.060 --> 57:03.820\n It's just more or less invented.\n\n57:03.820 --> 57:04.940\n Absolutely.\n\n57:04.940 --> 57:05.780\n Okay.\n\n57:05.780 --> 57:07.860\n The universe has to generate everything as it goes.\n\n57:07.860 --> 57:08.700\n Yeah.\n\n57:09.620 --> 57:11.060\n And it wasn't there in the beginning.\n\n57:11.060 --> 57:12.780\n And the way we're thinking it,\n\n57:12.780 --> 57:14.220\n when you're thinking about the difference\n\n57:14.220 --> 57:15.500\n between invented and discovered,\n\n57:15.500 --> 57:17.820\n is because we're throwing away all the memory.\n\n57:17.820 --> 57:18.660\n Yeah.\n\n57:18.660 --> 57:22.260\n So if you start to think in terms of causality and time,\n\n57:22.260 --> 57:23.700\n then those things become the same.\n\n57:23.700 --> 57:24.860\n Everything is invented.\n\n57:25.980 --> 57:27.600\n And the idea is to make everything intrinsic\n\n57:27.600 --> 57:28.440\n to the universe.\n\n57:28.440 --> 57:30.580\n So I think one of the features of assembly theory\n\n57:30.580 --> 57:32.520\n is we don't wanna have external observers.\n\n57:32.520 --> 57:33.980\n There's been this long tradition in physics\n\n57:33.980 --> 57:35.660\n of trying to describe the universe from the outside\n\n57:35.660 --> 57:36.620\n and not the inside.\n\n57:37.500 --> 57:40.100\n And the universe has to generate everything itself\n\n57:40.100 --> 57:41.060\n if you do it from the inside.\n\n57:41.060 --> 57:44.600\n Assembly theory describes how the universe builds itself.\n\n57:46.540 --> 57:48.540\n Did it take you 15 seconds to say that?\n\n57:48.540 --> 57:49.380\n Yeah.\n\n57:49.380 --> 57:50.220\n And to come up with that also?\n\n57:50.220 --> 57:51.300\n No, I've thought of that before.\n\n57:51.300 --> 57:52.140\n Okay.\n\n57:52.140 --> 57:52.980\n That's a good line.\n\n57:52.980 --> 57:53.800\n It's a, it's like.\n\n57:53.800 --> 57:54.860\n Oh, you're making fun of me.\n\n57:54.860 --> 57:56.540\n No, I'm not making fun, I'm having fun.\n\n57:56.540 --> 57:57.380\n There's a difference.\n\n57:57.380 --> 57:58.200\n Oh, that's good.\n\n57:58.200 --> 57:59.040\n All right.\n\n57:59.040 --> 57:59.880\n She's inventing fun.\n\n57:59.880 --> 58:01.020\n I'm not all intimidated.\n\n58:01.020 --> 58:01.860\n Yes.\n\n58:01.860 --> 58:05.060\n And there's a causal history to that fun.\n\n58:06.240 --> 58:08.880\n You mentioned that there's no way to communicate\n\n58:08.880 --> 58:12.680\n with aliens until there's overlap in the causal graph.\n\n58:14.160 --> 58:17.760\n Communication includes being able to see them.\n\n58:18.660 --> 58:21.920\n And like, what are we, this is the question is,\n\n58:23.760 --> 58:26.380\n is communication any kind of detection?\n\n58:26.380 --> 58:29.740\n And if so, what do aliens look like\n\n58:29.740 --> 58:33.100\n as you get more and more overlap on the causal graph?\n\n58:33.100 --> 58:35.880\n You're assuming, let's assume that aliens,\n\n58:35.880 --> 58:39.100\n so when you see them and they see you,\n\n58:39.100 --> 58:40.820\n you're assuming they have vision,\n\n58:40.820 --> 58:43.900\n they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.\n\n58:43.900 --> 58:45.780\n That's a lot of assumptions they're making.\n\n58:45.780 --> 58:46.620\n What detection?\n\n58:46.620 --> 58:47.540\n All right, let's step back.\n\n58:47.540 --> 58:49.140\n So yes, okay, you're right.\n\n58:49.140 --> 58:50.740\n So when, in the English language,\n\n58:50.740 --> 58:53.260\n when we say the word see, we mean visually,\n\n58:53.260 --> 58:54.820\n they show up to a party and it's like,\n\n58:54.820 --> 58:56.260\n oh, wow, that's an alien.\n\n58:56.260 --> 58:59.520\n That's visual, that's 3D, that's, okay.\n\n58:59.520 --> 59:02.100\n And that's also assuming scale,\n\n59:03.120 --> 59:05.620\n spatial scale of something that's visible to you.\n\n59:05.620 --> 59:08.420\n So it can't be microscopic or it can't be so big\n\n59:08.420 --> 59:10.740\n that you don't even realize that's an entity.\n\n59:10.740 --> 59:14.120\n Okay, but other kinds of detection too.\n\n59:14.120 --> 59:15.660\n I would make it more abstract and go down.\n\n59:15.660 --> 59:18.520\n I was thinking this morning about how to rewrite\n\n59:18.520 --> 59:21.180\n the Arecibo message in assembly theory\n\n59:21.180 --> 59:23.140\n and also to abandon binary.\n\n59:23.140 --> 59:25.140\n Because I don't think aliens necessarily,\n\n59:25.140 --> 59:27.240\n why should they have binary?\n\n59:27.240 --> 59:29.860\n Well, they have some basic elements\n\n59:29.860 --> 59:32.820\n with which to do information exchange.\n\n59:32.820 --> 59:37.180\n Let's make it more fundamental, more universal.\n\n59:37.180 --> 59:38.940\n So we need to think about what is the universal way\n\n59:38.940 --> 59:40.860\n of making a memory and then we should\n\n59:40.860 --> 59:43.380\n reencode Arecibo in that way.\n\n59:43.380 --> 59:45.660\n What's more basic than zeros and ones?\n\n59:45.660 --> 59:47.460\n Well, it's really difficult to get out\n\n59:47.460 --> 59:48.860\n that causal chain because we're so,\n\n59:48.860 --> 59:51.780\n so let's erase the idea of zero for a moment.\n\n59:51.780 --> 59:53.260\n It took human beings a long time\n\n59:53.260 --> 59:54.360\n to come up with the idea of zero.\n\n59:54.360 --> 59:56.780\n Now you got the idea of zero, you can't throw it away.\n\n59:56.780 --> 59:57.620\n It's so useful.\n\n59:57.620 --> 59:59.100\n To discover the idea of zero.\n\n59:59.100 --> 1:00:00.740\n To discover or invent.\n\n1:00:00.740 --> 1:00:02.620\n I don't know, but it took a long time\n\n1:00:02.620 --> 1:00:04.940\n so it was invented, that's right.\n\n1:00:04.940 --> 1:00:07.820\n Yeah, I think zero was invented, exactly.\n\n1:00:07.820 --> 1:00:10.860\n So it's not a given that aliens know what zero is.\n\n1:00:10.860 --> 1:00:13.540\n That's a massive assumption.\n\n1:00:13.540 --> 1:00:16.020\n It's a useful discovery.\n\n1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:18.100\n You're saying if you break the causal chain\n\n1:00:18.100 --> 1:00:20.580\n there might be some other more efficient way of representing.\n\n1:00:20.580 --> 1:00:23.100\n That's why I wanna meet him and ask him.\n\n1:00:23.100 --> 1:00:24.340\n For a shortcut.\n\n1:00:24.340 --> 1:00:27.620\n But you won't be able to ask him until.\n\n1:00:27.620 --> 1:00:29.940\n So I interrupted you and I think you're making good point.\n\n1:00:29.940 --> 1:00:31.100\n I was just gonna say, well look.\n\n1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:32.100\n Thank you.\n\n1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:32.940\n Sorry.\n\n1:00:34.220 --> 1:00:35.060\n Rather than saying.\n\n1:00:35.060 --> 1:00:37.820\n Please internet, tweet at him for the rude interruptions.\n\n1:00:37.820 --> 1:00:38.860\n Oh, go ahead, I'm sorry.\n\n1:00:38.860 --> 1:00:40.020\n No, it's okay.\n\n1:00:40.020 --> 1:00:41.220\n Maybe it's change.\n\n1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:44.980\n How do we, so, oh, I don't know what it's like\n\n1:00:44.980 --> 1:00:46.000\n to be an alien.\n\n1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:47.360\n I would like to know.\n\n1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:50.380\n What is the full spectrum of what aliens\n\n1:00:50.380 --> 1:00:52.280\n might look like to us?\n\n1:00:53.260 --> 1:00:57.300\n Now that we've laid this all on the table of like,\n\n1:00:57.300 --> 1:00:59.620\n all right, so there has to be some overlap\n\n1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:03.740\n in this causal chain that led to them.\n\n1:01:03.740 --> 1:01:05.740\n What are we looking for?\n\n1:01:05.740 --> 1:01:06.980\n What do you think we should be looking for?\n\n1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:09.180\n So you mentioned mass spec.\n\n1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:11.900\n Measuring certain objects that aliens could create\n\n1:01:11.900 --> 1:01:13.820\n or are aliens themselves.\n\n1:01:15.140 --> 1:01:17.620\n We show up to a planet or maybe not a planet.\n\n1:01:17.620 --> 1:01:20.420\n Or maybe, what the hell is the basic object\n\n1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:23.020\n we're trying to measure the assembly index of?\n\n1:01:23.020 --> 1:01:23.980\n Let's cut ourselves a break.\n\n1:01:23.980 --> 1:01:27.580\n Let's assume that they are metabolized.\n\n1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:29.140\n They've got an energy source.\n\n1:01:29.140 --> 1:01:32.980\n And they're a size that we can recognize.\n\n1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:34.140\n Let's give ourselves a break.\n\n1:01:34.140 --> 1:01:36.340\n Because there could be aliens that are so big\n\n1:01:36.340 --> 1:01:38.060\n we won't recognize we're seeing them.\n\n1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:39.360\n There might be aliens that are so small\n\n1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:40.980\n we don't yet have the ability to,\n\n1:01:40.980 --> 1:01:44.060\n we don't have microscopes that can see far enough away\n\n1:01:44.060 --> 1:01:45.380\n that just wouldn't be able to see them.\n\n1:01:45.380 --> 1:01:46.500\n So what's a good range?\n\n1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:47.900\n So let's just make a range.\n\n1:01:47.900 --> 1:01:50.540\n Let's just be very anthropocentric and say,\n\n1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:52.460\n we're gonna look for aliens roughly our size\n\n1:01:52.460 --> 1:01:53.860\n and technology our size.\n\n1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:56.460\n Because we know it's possible on Earth, right?\n\n1:01:56.460 --> 1:01:57.660\n I mean, a reasonable thing to do would be\n\n1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:01.060\n to find exoplanets that are in the same zone as Earth\n\n1:02:01.060 --> 1:02:03.180\n in terms of heat and stuff.\n\n1:02:03.180 --> 1:02:06.300\n And then say, hey, if there's that same kind of gravity,\n\n1:02:06.300 --> 1:02:09.820\n same kind of stuff, we could reasonably assume\n\n1:02:09.820 --> 1:02:13.740\n that alien life there might use a similar kind\n\n1:02:13.740 --> 1:02:15.980\n of physical infrastructure.\n\n1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:16.820\n And then we're good.\n\n1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:19.540\n So then your question becomes really relevant.\n\n1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:22.220\n Say, right, let's use vision, sound, touch.\n\n1:02:23.260 --> 1:02:24.100\n And then.\n\n1:02:24.100 --> 1:02:24.940\n So okay, that's really nice.\n\n1:02:24.940 --> 1:02:27.820\n So that if there's a lot of aliens out there,\n\n1:02:27.820 --> 1:02:32.500\n there's a good likelihood if you match to the planet\n\n1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:35.460\n that they're going to be in the same spatial\n\n1:02:35.460 --> 1:02:38.340\n and temporal, operating in the same spatial\n\n1:02:38.340 --> 1:02:40.460\n and temporal domain as humans.\n\n1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:45.460\n Okay, within that, what do they look like visually?\n\n1:02:47.980 --> 1:02:49.660\n What do they sound like?\n\n1:02:49.660 --> 1:02:52.020\n What do they, oh god, this sounds creepy.\n\n1:02:52.020 --> 1:02:56.460\n Tastes like, what do they, oh, smell like, smell like.\n\n1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:57.540\n That sounds like our clubhouse.\n\n1:02:57.540 --> 1:02:59.300\n We was like, can we have sex with aliens?\n\n1:02:59.300 --> 1:03:01.020\n Which was basically me saying.\n\n1:03:01.020 --> 1:03:01.860\n Passionate, passionate love.\n\n1:03:01.860 --> 1:03:02.780\n But it wasn't actually about sex.\n\n1:03:02.780 --> 1:03:04.900\n It was about, is our chemistry compatible, right?\n\n1:03:04.900 --> 1:03:05.780\n Is there some?\n\n1:03:05.780 --> 1:03:06.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:06.620 --> 1:03:09.580\n Yeah, can we, yeah.\n\n1:03:09.580 --> 1:03:10.820\n Are they edible too?\n\n1:03:10.820 --> 1:03:12.180\n They could be very edible.\n\n1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:13.020\n They could be delicious.\n\n1:03:13.020 --> 1:03:14.740\n That's why I want to see some aliens, right?\n\n1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:17.700\n Because I think, are there, I think evolution,\n\n1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:21.540\n I mean, evolution exploits symmetry, right?\n\n1:03:21.540 --> 1:03:23.380\n Because why generate memory?\n\n1:03:23.380 --> 1:03:26.020\n Why generate storage, the need for storage space\n\n1:03:26.020 --> 1:03:27.660\n when you can use symmetry?\n\n1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:30.580\n So, and symmetry is quite, may be quite effective\n\n1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:33.020\n in allowing you to mechanically design stuff, right?\n\n1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:36.180\n So maybe alien, you could be reasonable to assume\n\n1:03:36.180 --> 1:03:39.900\n that aliens could have, they could be bipedal.\n\n1:03:39.900 --> 1:03:42.420\n They could be symmetric in the same way.\n\n1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:44.860\n Might have a couple of eyes or a couple of senses.\n\n1:03:44.860 --> 1:03:47.980\n We can make them, perhaps there's this whole zoo\n\n1:03:47.980 --> 1:03:49.100\n of different aliens out there.\n\n1:03:49.100 --> 1:03:50.740\n And we'll never get to be able to classify\n\n1:03:50.740 --> 1:03:52.620\n some of the weird aliens we can't interact with\n\n1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:55.660\n because they have made such weird stuff.\n\n1:03:55.660 --> 1:03:57.220\n But we are just going to look at,\n\n1:03:57.220 --> 1:03:59.140\n we're going to find aliens that look most like us.\n\n1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:00.380\n Why not?\n\n1:04:00.380 --> 1:04:02.260\n Because those are the first ones we're likely to see.\n\n1:04:02.260 --> 1:04:03.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:03.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:03.940 --> 1:04:06.060\n But I think it's really hard to imagine\n\n1:04:06.060 --> 1:04:09.420\n what the space of aliens is because the space is huge.\n\n1:04:09.420 --> 1:04:11.180\n Because, you know, like one of the arguments\n\n1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:13.260\n that you can make about why life emerges in chemistry\n\n1:04:13.260 --> 1:04:16.540\n is because chemistry is the first scale\n\n1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:17.900\n in terms of like, you know,\n\n1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:21.380\n building up objects from elementary objects.\n\n1:04:21.380 --> 1:04:23.380\n That the number of possible things that could exist\n\n1:04:23.380 --> 1:04:25.740\n is larger than the universe can possibly make all at once.\n\n1:04:25.740 --> 1:04:26.580\n Right?\n\n1:04:26.580 --> 1:04:29.380\n So imagine you have two planets\n\n1:04:29.380 --> 1:04:31.700\n and they're cooking some geochemistry.\n\n1:04:31.700 --> 1:04:34.860\n You know, our planet invented one kind of biochemistry.\n\n1:04:34.860 --> 1:04:37.140\n And presumably as you start building up\n\n1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:38.860\n the complexity of the molecules,\n\n1:04:38.860 --> 1:04:41.300\n the chances of the overlap in those trajectories,\n\n1:04:41.300 --> 1:04:44.900\n those causal chains being built up is probably very low.\n\n1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:47.700\n And it gets lower and lower as it gets further advanced\n\n1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:49.140\n along its evolutionary path.\n\n1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:51.500\n So I think it's very difficult to imagine\n\n1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:54.560\n predicting the technologies that aliens are gonna have.\n\n1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:57.420\n I mean, it's so, you're looking at basically\n\n1:04:57.420 --> 1:04:59.680\n planets have kind of convergent chemistry,\n\n1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:00.840\n but there's some variability.\n\n1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:02.720\n And then you're looking basically at the outgrowth\n\n1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:04.540\n into the possibility space for chemistry.\n\n1:05:04.540 --> 1:05:07.460\n So do you think we would detect the technology,\n\n1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:11.540\n the objects created by aliens before we detect the aliens?\n\n1:05:11.540 --> 1:05:12.380\n Possibly.\n\n1:05:12.380 --> 1:05:15.820\n So when you're talking about measuring assembly index,\n\n1:05:15.820 --> 1:05:19.260\n don't you think we would detect the garbage first?\n\n1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:21.780\n Like at the outskirts of alien civilizations,\n\n1:05:21.780 --> 1:05:23.380\n isn't this just gonna be trash?\n\n1:05:26.140 --> 1:05:28.040\n I think I would come back to Arecibo.\n\n1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:30.380\n The Arecibo message sent from the Arecibo telescope\n\n1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:33.500\n built by Drake, I think, and Sagan.\n\n1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:35.560\n How's Arecibo spelled?\n\n1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.100\n A R E C I B O.\n\n1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:37.940\n Yes, thank you.\n\n1:05:37.940 --> 1:05:40.020\n And there we go, they've got that up there.\n\n1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:41.900\n That's the telescope that sent the message\n\n1:05:41.900 --> 1:05:42.740\n that you're talking about.\n\n1:05:42.740 --> 1:05:45.540\n So that message was sent where?\n\n1:05:45.540 --> 1:05:48.540\n It was beamed at a star, a specific star,\n\n1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:51.340\n and it was sent out many years ago.\n\n1:05:52.300 --> 1:05:55.160\n And what they did, so this is why I was pushing on binary,\n\n1:05:55.160 --> 1:05:56.960\n it's a binary message.\n\n1:05:56.960 --> 1:05:59.980\n I think it's a semi prime length number of characters.\n\n1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:03.820\n So I think 73 by 23, I think.\n\n1:06:03.820 --> 1:06:07.100\n And it basically represents human bit proton,\n\n1:06:07.100 --> 1:06:10.500\n binary, human beings, DNA, male and female.\n\n1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:12.660\n And it's really cool.\n\n1:06:12.660 --> 1:06:17.660\n But I'm just wondering if it could be done\n\n1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:19.860\n not making any,\n\n1:06:19.860 --> 1:06:22.880\n cause it made assumptions that aliens speak binary.\n\n1:06:22.880 --> 1:06:24.180\n Why make that assumption?\n\n1:06:24.180 --> 1:06:27.660\n Why not just assume that if the difference between physics,\n\n1:06:27.660 --> 1:06:29.860\n chemistry and biology is the amount of memory\n\n1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:33.860\n that's instead that's recordable by the substrates,\n\n1:06:33.860 --> 1:06:36.860\n then surely the universal thing,\n\n1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:38.780\n I'm gonna make some sacrilegious statement,\n\n1:06:38.780 --> 1:06:42.420\n which I think is pretty awesome for people to argue with.\n\n1:06:42.420 --> 1:06:44.740\n So this is, we're looking at an image\n\n1:06:44.740 --> 1:06:49.660\n where it's the entirety of the message encoded in binary.\n\n1:06:49.660 --> 1:06:52.220\n And then there's a probably interpretation\n\n1:06:52.220 --> 1:06:53.820\n of different parts of that image.\n\n1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:57.900\n There's a person, there's green parts.\n\n1:06:57.900 --> 1:06:59.600\n It looks like for people just listening,\n\n1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:01.620\n like a game of Tetris.\n\n1:07:01.620 --> 1:07:03.620\n So it's encoding in minimal ways,\n\n1:07:03.620 --> 1:07:05.700\n a bunch of cool information, probably.\n\n1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:06.780\n Representing all of us.\n\n1:07:06.780 --> 1:07:08.940\n So the topic's kind of teaching us how to count\n\n1:07:08.940 --> 1:07:10.040\n and then it all goes all the way down\n\n1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:12.340\n teaching you chemistry and then just says,\n\n1:07:12.340 --> 1:07:14.020\n but it makes so many assumptions.\n\n1:07:14.020 --> 1:07:16.080\n And I think if we can actually,\n\n1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:19.220\n so look, I think, I mean, Sarah's much more eloquent\n\n1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:20.500\n in expressing this, but I'll have a go\n\n1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:21.900\n and you can correct it if you want,\n\n1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:25.380\n which is like one of the things that Sarah has had\n\n1:07:25.380 --> 1:07:29.500\n a profound effect on the way I look at the origin of life.\n\n1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:31.580\n And this is one of the reasons why we're working together\n\n1:07:31.580 --> 1:07:34.180\n because we don't really care about the origin of life.\n\n1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:37.580\n We wanna make life, make aliens and find aliens.\n\n1:07:37.580 --> 1:07:38.840\n Make aliens, find aliens.\n\n1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:40.740\n I think we might have to make aliens in the lab\n\n1:07:40.740 --> 1:07:42.860\n before we find aliens in the universe, right?\n\n1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:45.460\n I think that would be a cool way to do it.\n\n1:07:45.460 --> 1:07:48.340\n So what is it about the universe that creates aliens?\n\n1:07:48.340 --> 1:07:51.620\n Well, it's selection through assembly theory,\n\n1:07:51.620 --> 1:07:53.620\n creating memories, because when you create memories,\n\n1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:57.100\n you can then command your domain.\n\n1:07:57.100 --> 1:07:58.380\n You can basically do stuff.\n\n1:07:58.380 --> 1:07:59.940\n You can command matter.\n\n1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:03.600\n So we need to find a way by understanding what life is\n\n1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:05.980\n of how the minimal way to command matter,\n\n1:08:05.980 --> 1:08:08.220\n how that would emerge in the universe.\n\n1:08:08.220 --> 1:08:10.000\n And if we want to communicate,\n\n1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:11.020\n I mean, maybe we don't want\n\n1:08:11.020 --> 1:08:13.660\n to necessarily uniformly communicate.\n\n1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:15.340\n What I would do perhaps if I had,\n\n1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:18.140\n is I would send out lots of probes away from Earth\n\n1:08:18.140 --> 1:08:20.060\n that have this magic way of communicating with aliens,\n\n1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:23.540\n get them quite a far away from Earth, plausibly deniable,\n\n1:08:23.540 --> 1:08:25.700\n and then send out the message\n\n1:08:25.700 --> 1:08:27.220\n that would then attract all the aliens,\n\n1:08:27.220 --> 1:08:29.620\n and then basically work out if they were friend or foe\n\n1:08:29.620 --> 1:08:30.660\n and how they wanna hang out.\n\n1:08:30.660 --> 1:08:33.020\n The messages being something has to do with the memories.\n\n1:08:33.020 --> 1:08:36.820\n Yes, like the assembly version of Arecibo,\n\n1:08:36.820 --> 1:08:38.420\n so that everyone in the universe\n\n1:08:38.420 --> 1:08:40.980\n that has been understands what life is.\n\n1:08:40.980 --> 1:08:43.300\n So aliens need to work out what they are.\n\n1:08:43.300 --> 1:08:44.900\n Once they've worked out what they are,\n\n1:08:44.900 --> 1:08:47.220\n they then can work out how to encode what they are,\n\n1:08:47.220 --> 1:08:48.660\n and then they can go out and send messages.\n\n1:08:48.660 --> 1:08:52.820\n It's like the universal, the Rosetta Stone\n\n1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:55.940\n for life in the universe is working out\n\n1:08:55.940 --> 1:08:56.940\n how the memories are built.\n\n1:08:56.940 --> 1:08:59.140\n I don't know, Sarah, you have any, well,\n\n1:09:01.180 --> 1:09:02.880\n whether you would agree with that.\n\n1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:06.140\n No, I wanted to raise a different point,\n\n1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:09.500\n which is about the fact that we can't see the aliens yet\n\n1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:11.660\n because we haven't gotten the technology.\n\n1:09:11.660 --> 1:09:14.060\n And presumably we think assembly theory\n\n1:09:14.060 --> 1:09:15.140\n is the right way of doing it,\n\n1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:16.500\n but I don't think that we know how to go\n\n1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.900\n from the kind of data you're describing, Lex,\n\n1:09:18.900 --> 1:09:21.280\n like visual data or smell\n\n1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:23.500\n to construct the assembly spaces yet.\n\n1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:25.660\n And in some ways, I think that the problem\n\n1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:28.460\n of life detection really is the same problem\n\n1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:31.660\n at the foundations of AI that we don't understand\n\n1:09:31.660 --> 1:09:35.100\n how to get machines to see causal graphs,\n\n1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:36.980\n to see reality in terms of causation.\n\n1:09:37.860 --> 1:09:40.340\n And so I think assembly and AI\n\n1:09:40.340 --> 1:09:43.660\n are gonna intersect in interesting ways, hopefully,\n\n1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:46.100\n but the sort of key point,\n\n1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:49.660\n and I've been trying to make this argument more recently,\n\n1:09:49.660 --> 1:09:50.820\n I might write an essay on it,\n\n1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:53.460\n is people talk about the great filter, right?\n\n1:09:53.460 --> 1:09:55.540\n And which is, again, this doomsday thing\n\n1:09:55.540 --> 1:09:57.820\n that people wanna say there's no aliens out there\n\n1:09:57.820 --> 1:10:00.140\n because something terrible happened to them.\n\n1:10:00.140 --> 1:10:03.820\n And it matters whether that's in our past or our future\n\n1:10:03.820 --> 1:10:06.460\n as to the longevity of our species, presumably,\n\n1:10:06.460 --> 1:10:07.980\n which is why people find it interesting.\n\n1:10:07.980 --> 1:10:10.780\n But I think it's not a physical filter.\n\n1:10:10.780 --> 1:10:11.980\n It's not like things go extinct.\n\n1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:12.800\n I think it's literally,\n\n1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:15.700\n we don't have the technology to see them.\n\n1:10:15.700 --> 1:10:17.020\n And you could see that with microscopes.\n\n1:10:17.020 --> 1:10:18.660\n I mean, we didn't know there were microbes on this table\n\n1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:21.760\n or tables for thousands of years or telescopes.\n\n1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.460\n Like there's so much of the universe we can't see.\n\n1:10:23.460 --> 1:10:25.700\n And then basically what we have done as a species\n\n1:10:25.700 --> 1:10:29.280\n is outsource our physical perceptions to technology,\n\n1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:31.180\n building microscopes based on our eyes,\n\n1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:34.920\n and building seismometers based on our sense of feelings,\n\n1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:36.240\n like feel earthquakes and things.\n\n1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:38.120\n And AI is basically we're trying to outsource\n\n1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:40.560\n what's actually happening in our thinking apparatus\n\n1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:43.120\n into machines now and to technological devices.\n\n1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:45.100\n And maybe that's the key technology\n\n1:10:45.100 --> 1:10:47.220\n that's gonna allow us to see things like us\n\n1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:48.800\n and see the universe in a totally different way.\n\n1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:50.240\n But you kind of mentioned the great filter.\n\n1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:52.280\n Do you think there's a way through technology\n\n1:10:52.280 --> 1:10:54.000\n to stop being able to see stuff?\n\n1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.760\n So can you take a step backwards?\n\n1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:56.600\n I think so, yeah.\n\n1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.640\n Did you imply that with the great, so like?\n\n1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:01.080\n Well, no, I mean, I think there's a great perceptual filter\n\n1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:06.080\n in the sense that a example of life evolving on a planet\n\n1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:08.800\n over billions of years has to acquire\n\n1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:11.000\n a certain amount of knowledge and technology\n\n1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.640\n to actually recognize the phenomena that it is.\n\n1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:17.040\n Well, that's the sense I have is,\n\n1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:20.640\n I mean, you talk with physicists, engineers in general,\n\n1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:23.760\n there's this kind of idea that we have\n\n1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:27.960\n most of the tools already to hear the signal.\n\n1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:31.800\n But to me, it feels like we don't have any of the tools\n\n1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:32.640\n to see the signal.\n\n1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:33.680\n No, we don't know what we're doing, yeah, I agree.\n\n1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:35.840\n That's the biggest, like to hear.\n\n1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:37.840\n We don't have the tools to really hear, to see.\n\n1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:39.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:40.160\n Aliens are everywhere.\n\n1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:44.960\n We just don't have the, yeah, well, oh, that's.\n\n1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:46.320\n I mean, I got this in part, actually,\n\n1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:47.460\n because you were like, you know,\n\n1:11:47.460 --> 1:11:49.480\n last time I was here, he was like, look at the carpet.\n\n1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:51.160\n You know, if you had an alien detector\n\n1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:52.600\n where the carpet be aliens.\n\n1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:54.560\n I mean, I think we really don't.\n\n1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:56.080\n I think it would be.\n\n1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:58.960\n But the aliens would nevertheless have a high assembly index\n\n1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:01.240\n or produce things of high assembly index.\n\n1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.280\n And those things of high assembly index,\n\n1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:07.120\n you have to have a detector that can recognize\n\n1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:09.160\n high assembly index in all its forms.\n\n1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:10.080\n Yeah. Yes.\n\n1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:10.920\n That's it, that's it.\n\n1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:13.760\n Take data, construct assembly space.\n\n1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:15.240\n Yeah. Those patterns, basically.\n\n1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.480\n So one way to think about high assembly index\n\n1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:21.560\n is interesting patterns of basic ingredients.\n\n1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.240\n I can give you an example,\n\n1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:24.360\n because I mean, in molecules,\n\n1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:25.480\n we've been talking about in objects,\n\n1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:29.080\n but we're also trying to do it in spatial trajectories.\n\n1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:30.980\n Like, imagine you're just,\n\n1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:33.660\n like, I always get bothered by the fact that, like,\n\n1:12:33.660 --> 1:12:35.400\n when you look at birds flocking,\n\n1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:37.460\n you can describe that with like a simple Boyd's model,\n\n1:12:37.460 --> 1:12:38.960\n or like, you know, people use spin glass\n\n1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:40.120\n to describe animal behavior.\n\n1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:42.100\n And those are like really simple physics models.\n\n1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:46.740\n Yet you're looking at a system that you know has agency\n\n1:12:46.740 --> 1:12:48.840\n and there's intelligence in those birds.\n\n1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:52.000\n And basically, like, you can't help but think\n\n1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:53.920\n there must be some statistical signatures\n\n1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:55.720\n of the fact that they're,\n\n1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:58.120\n that's a group of agents versus, you know, like,\n\n1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:00.200\n I don't know, you know, the physics example,\n\n1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:03.720\n maybe like, I don't know, Brownian motion or something.\n\n1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:04.640\n And so what we're trying to do\n\n1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:06.640\n is actually apply assembly to trajectory data\n\n1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:09.920\n to try to say there's a minimal amount of causal history\n\n1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:12.880\n to build up certain trajectories for observed agents\n\n1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:15.160\n that's like an agency detector for behavior.\n\n1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.880\n Do you think it's possible to do some like Boyd's\n\n1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:21.740\n or those kinds of things, like artificial,\n\n1:13:21.740 --> 1:13:25.000\n like cellular automata, play with those ideas\n\n1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.300\n with assembly, with assembly theory?\n\n1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:32.100\n Have you found any useful, really simple mathematical,\n\n1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:36.040\n like, simulation tools that allow you\n\n1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:38.040\n to play with these concepts?\n\n1:13:38.040 --> 1:13:40.840\n So like one, of course, you're doing mass spec\n\n1:13:40.840 --> 1:13:44.280\n in this physical space with chemistry,\n\n1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:45.760\n but it just seems, well, I mean,\n\n1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:47.360\n computer science person, maybe,\n\n1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:48.760\n it seems easier to just.\n\n1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:49.600\n I agree with you.\n\n1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:53.320\n It seems even sexier in terms of tweeting visual information\n\n1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:56.600\n on Twitter or Instagram, more importantly,\n\n1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:01.120\n to play like, here's an organism of a low assembly index\n\n1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:03.560\n and here's an organism of a high assembly index\n\n1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:07.320\n and let's watch them create more and more memories\n\n1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:09.300\n and more and more complex objects.\n\n1:14:09.300 --> 1:14:11.040\n And so like, in mathematics,\n\n1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:12.920\n you get to observe what that looks like\n\n1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:15.760\n to build up an intuition what assembly index is like.\n\n1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:17.840\n We are building a toolkit right now.\n\n1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:19.680\n So I think it's a really good idea,\n\n1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:22.080\n but what we've got to do is I'm kind of still obsessed\n\n1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:24.220\n with the infrastructure required.\n\n1:14:24.220 --> 1:14:27.040\n And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information\n\n1:14:27.040 --> 1:14:29.500\n and mathematics when human beings,\n\n1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:31.800\n when human beings, we take a lot of the infrastructure\n\n1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:33.000\n for granted.\n\n1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.120\n And I think we have to strip that back a bit\n\n1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:36.840\n for going forward, but you're absolutely right.\n\n1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:40.520\n I would agree that I think the fact that we exist\n\n1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:42.480\n in the universe, this is like,\n\n1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:44.480\n I can see that lots of people would disagree\n\n1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:47.080\n with the statement, but I don't think Sarah will,\n\n1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:48.440\n but I don't know.\n\n1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:50.480\n The fact that objects exist,\n\n1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:53.500\n I don't think anyone on earth will disagree\n\n1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:55.860\n that objects can exist elsewhere, right?\n\n1:14:55.860 --> 1:14:58.880\n But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere.\n\n1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:01.200\n But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that\n\n1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:06.200\n the acquisition, the universe's ability to acquire memory\n\n1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:10.120\n is the very first step for building life.\n\n1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:14.120\n And that must be, that's so easy to happen.\n\n1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:16.640\n So therefore alien life is everywhere\n\n1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:18.800\n because all alien life is,\n\n1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:22.120\n is those memories being compressed and minimalized\n\n1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:24.800\n and the alien equivalent of the cell working.\n\n1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:27.800\n So I think that we will build new technologies\n\n1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:32.280\n to find aliens, but we need to understand what we are first\n\n1:15:32.280 --> 1:15:35.440\n and how we go from physics to chemistry to biology.\n\n1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:38.640\n The most interesting thing,\n\n1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.960\n as you're saying to these two organisms,\n\n1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:43.640\n different assemblies, there's one you get into biology.\n\n1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:45.000\n Biology gets more and more weird,\n\n1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.520\n more and more contingent.\n\n1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:48.840\n Physics is, chemistry is less weird\n\n1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:50.200\n cause the rules of chemistry are smaller\n\n1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:51.040\n than the rules of biology.\n\n1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:53.920\n And then going away to physics where you have a very\n\n1:15:56.040 --> 1:16:00.280\n nicely tangible number of ways of arranging things.\n\n1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:03.880\n And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that.\n\n1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:04.800\n And so once we get there,\n\n1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:08.280\n my dream is that we are just gonna be able to suddenly,\n\n1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.600\n I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here.\n\n1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:11.600\n I don't mean to be arrogant.\n\n1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:14.080\n It's just, I've got this hammer called assembly\n\n1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:15.400\n and everything's a nail.\n\n1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:17.400\n But I think that once we crack it,\n\n1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:20.120\n we'll be able to use assembly theory plus telescopes\n\n1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:20.960\n to find aliens.\n\n1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:25.680\n Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee\n\n1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:28.920\n on the number of aliens that are out there?\n\n1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:30.440\n I do actually, yeah, well.\n\n1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:31.640\n And what they look like.\n\n1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:33.240\n So any of the things we've been talking about,\n\n1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:38.240\n is there nuanced, it's always nice to discover wisdom\n\n1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:43.520\n through nuanced disagreement.\n\n1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:47.360\n Yeah, I don't wholly disagree, but I think,\n\n1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:48.640\n but I do think I disagree.\n\n1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:51.360\n It's kind of, there's nuance there.\n\n1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:52.200\n But Lee made it.\n\n1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:53.040\n You can disagree.\n\n1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:54.640\n No, it's fine.\n\n1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:55.720\n It is nuanced, right?\n\n1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:58.160\n So you made the point earlier that you think,\n\n1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:02.000\n once we discover what life is,\n\n1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.400\n we'll see alien life everywhere.\n\n1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:06.440\n And I think I agree on some levels in the sense\n\n1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:09.160\n that I think the physics that governs us is universal.\n\n1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:11.360\n But I don't know how far I would go to say,\n\n1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:12.960\n to say that we're a likely phenomenon\n\n1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:15.920\n because we don't understand all of the features\n\n1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:17.680\n of the transition at the origin of life,\n\n1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:19.720\n which we would just say in assembly,\n\n1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:22.680\n as you go from the no memory physics\n\n1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:26.120\n to there's like a critical transition\n\n1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:27.160\n around the assembly index\n\n1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:28.760\n where assembliness starts to increase.\n\n1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:30.280\n And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere\n\n1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:32.920\n and complexification of the biosphere.\n\n1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:34.760\n So there's a principle of increasing assembliness\n\n1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:35.840\n where that goes back to what I was saying\n\n1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:38.040\n at the very beginning about the physics of the possible,\n\n1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:40.760\n that the universe basically gets in this mode\n\n1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:44.080\n of trying to make as much possibilities as possible.\n\n1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:48.960\n Now, how often that transition happens\n\n1:17:48.960 --> 1:17:50.600\n that you get the kind of cascading effect\n\n1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:53.080\n that we get in our biosphere, I think we don't know.\n\n1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:54.680\n If we did, we would know the likelihood of life\n\n1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:55.520\n in the universe.\n\n1:17:55.520 --> 1:17:57.120\n And a lot of people wanna say life is common,\n\n1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:58.400\n but I don't think that we can say that yet\n\n1:17:58.400 --> 1:17:59.880\n till we have the empirical data,\n\n1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.360\n which I think you would agree with.\n\n1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:04.480\n But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have\n\n1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:07.960\n which I don't like, but I did have it,\n\n1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:11.800\n which is if life emerges on one planet\n\n1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:13.440\n and you get this real high density of things\n\n1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:14.680\n that can exist on that planet,\n\n1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:17.880\n is it sort of dominating the density of creation\n\n1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:19.360\n that the universe can actually generate?\n\n1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:21.480\n So like if you're thinking about counting entropy, right?\n\n1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:23.840\n Like the universe has a certain amount of stuff in it.\n\n1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:27.920\n And then assembly is kind of like an entropic principle.\n\n1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:29.080\n It's not entropy.\n\n1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:33.000\n But the idea is that now transformations among stuff\n\n1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.200\n or the actual physical histories of things\n\n1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:37.680\n now become things that you have to count\n\n1:18:37.680 --> 1:18:40.160\n as far as saying that these things exist\n\n1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:42.880\n and we're increasing the number of things that exist.\n\n1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:45.520\n And if you think about that cosmologically,\n\n1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:47.720\n maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential\n\n1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:49.440\n of the whole universe, I don't know.\n\n1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:50.280\n But I haven't.\n\n1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:51.960\n How's that, can you expand that a little bit?\n\n1:18:51.960 --> 1:18:54.400\n Why can any one geographical region\n\n1:18:54.400 --> 1:18:57.640\n suck up the creative capacity of the universe?\n\n1:18:57.640 --> 1:19:00.280\n Just like, I know it's a ridiculous thought.\n\n1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:01.600\n I don't actually agree with it,\n\n1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:02.440\n but it was just a thought experiment.\n\n1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:04.640\n I love that you can have thoughts\n\n1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.000\n that you don't like and don't agree with,\n\n1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.040\n but you have to think through them anyway.\n\n1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:11.960\n The human mind is fascinating.\n\n1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:15.400\n Yeah, I think these sort of counterfactual\n\n1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:16.440\n thought experiments are really good\n\n1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:17.640\n when you're trying to build new theories\n\n1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:19.960\n because you have to think through all the consequences.\n\n1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:23.480\n And there are people that want to try to account for,\n\n1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:25.240\n say, the degrees of freedom on our planet\n\n1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:28.560\n in cosmological inventories of talking about\n\n1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:29.680\n the entropy of the universe.\n\n1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:32.200\n And when we're thinking about cosmological\n\n1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.600\n arrow of time and things like that.\n\n1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:35.480\n Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals\n\n1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:37.120\n as they stand now, but assembly would give you\n\n1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:38.320\n a way of counting it.\n\n1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:40.200\n And then the question is if there's a certain\n\n1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:43.160\n maximal capacity of the universe's speed\n\n1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:45.480\n of generating stuff, which Lee always has this argument\n\n1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:47.600\n that assembly is about time.\n\n1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:49.280\n The universe is generating more states.\n\n1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:52.920\n Really what it's generating is more assembly possibilities.\n\n1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:56.120\n And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that,\n\n1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:58.280\n that the universe is accelerating its expansion\n\n1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:00.080\n because that makes more physical space.\n\n1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:02.440\n And what's happening on our planet is it's accelerating\n\n1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:05.200\n in the expansion of possible things that exist.\n\n1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.120\n And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate\n\n1:20:07.120 --> 1:20:09.360\n of what it can do to generate things.\n\n1:20:09.360 --> 1:20:11.080\n And then if there is a maximal rate,\n\n1:20:11.080 --> 1:20:12.400\n maybe only a certain number of planets\n\n1:20:12.400 --> 1:20:13.600\n can actually do that.\n\n1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:16.160\n Or there's a trade off about the pace of growth\n\n1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:18.080\n on certain planets versus others.\n\n1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:19.240\n I have a million questions there,\n\n1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.840\n but do you have thoughts on?\n\n1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:22.560\n Just a quick, yeah, I'll just say something very quick.\n\n1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:23.400\n It's a thought experiment.\n\n1:20:23.400 --> 1:20:24.320\n No, it's good, I think I get it.\n\n1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:25.160\n I think I get it.\n\n1:20:25.160 --> 1:20:29.000\n So what I want to say is when I mean aliens are everywhere,\n\n1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:34.000\n I mean memories are the prerequisite\n\n1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.960\n for aliens via selection\n\n1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:39.000\n and then concentration of selection\n\n1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:40.320\n when selection becomes autonomous.\n\n1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:42.440\n So what I would love to do is to build,\n\n1:20:42.440 --> 1:20:45.440\n say a magical telescope that was a memory,\n\n1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:48.040\n a magical one, or a real one,\n\n1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:51.320\n that would be a memory detector to see selection.\n\n1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:54.080\n So you could get to exoplanets and say that exoplanet\n\n1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:56.160\n looks like there's lots of selection going on there.\n\n1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:58.720\n Maybe there's evolution and maybe there's going to be life.\n\n1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.120\n So what I'm trying to say is narrow down\n\n1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:01.640\n the regions of space where you say\n\n1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:05.320\n there's definitely evidence of memory as high assembly there\n\n1:21:05.320 --> 1:21:07.000\n or not high assembly, because that would be life,\n\n1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:11.120\n but where it's capable of happening.\n\n1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:14.400\n And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens.\n\n1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:16.920\n I don't know how likely it is to make the transition\n\n1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:18.840\n to cells and all the other things.\n\n1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:20.200\n I think you're right.\n\n1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:23.360\n But I think that we just need to get more data.\n\n1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:24.800\n Well, I didn't like the thought experiment\n\n1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:25.960\n because I don't like the idea\n\n1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:27.560\n that if the universe has a maximal limit\n\n1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.640\n on the amount it can generate per unit time\n\n1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:31.800\n that our existence is actually precluding the existence\n\n1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:32.640\n of other things.\n\n1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:33.480\n Well, I'll just say one thing.\n\n1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:34.320\n But I think that's probably true anyway\n\n1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:35.520\n because of the resource limitations.\n\n1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:37.320\n So I don't like your thought experiment\n\n1:21:37.320 --> 1:21:39.280\n because I think it's wrong.\n\n1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:41.400\n Well, no, no, I do like the thought experiment.\n\n1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:42.320\n So what you're trying to say is like,\n\n1:21:42.320 --> 1:21:44.040\n there is a chain of events that goes back\n\n1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:48.120\n that's manifestly culminated with life on Earth.\n\n1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.120\n And you're not saying that life isn't possible elsewhere.\n\n1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:52.320\n You say that there has been these number of things,\n\n1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:53.560\n contingent things that have happened\n\n1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:55.680\n that have allowed life to merge here.\n\n1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:58.200\n That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere,\n\n1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:00.400\n but you're saying that the intersection of events\n\n1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:03.040\n may be concentrated here, right?\n\n1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:05.000\n And I think there's...\n\n1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:06.240\n Not exactly.\n\n1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:10.720\n It's more like if you look at,\n\n1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:12.200\n say the causal graphs are fundamental,\n\n1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:14.080\n maybe space is an emergent property,\n\n1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:16.680\n which is consistent with some proposals on quantum gravity,\n\n1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:18.960\n but also how we talk about things in assembly theory.\n\n1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:22.200\n Then the universe is causal graphs generating\n\n1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:24.200\n more structure in causal graphs, right?\n\n1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:26.160\n So this is how the universe is unfolding.\n\n1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:30.040\n And maybe there's a cap on the rate of generation.\n\n1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:31.640\n Like there's only so much stuff\n\n1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:34.600\n that gets made per update of the universe.\n\n1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:36.360\n And then if there's a lot of stuff being made\n\n1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:38.480\n in a particular region that happens\n\n1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:40.920\n to look the same locally, spatially,\n\n1:22:40.920 --> 1:22:43.280\n that's an after effect of the fact\n\n1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:45.360\n that the whole causal graph is updating.\n\n1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:47.600\n Like it's...\n\n1:22:47.600 --> 1:22:49.240\n Yeah, I don't know that.\n\n1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:51.000\n I think that that doesn't work.\n\n1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:51.920\n I don't think it works either,\n\n1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:53.720\n but I don't have a good argument in my mind about.\n\n1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:55.960\n But I do like the idea of the capacity that universe,\n\n1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:57.600\n cause you've got the number of states.\n\n1:22:57.600 --> 1:22:59.320\n Yeah, we can come back to it.\n\n1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:00.360\n Let me ask real quick.\n\n1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:04.680\n Like why does different like local pockets\n\n1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:07.400\n of the universe start remembering stuff?\n\n1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:10.480\n How does memory emerge exactly?\n\n1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:15.480\n So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful.\n\n1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:17.680\n That's when the physicists were happiest.\n\n1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:19.680\n It was low memory objects,\n\n1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.880\n which is like ultra low memory objects,\n\n1:23:23.880 --> 1:23:26.520\n which is what the definition of stuff.\n\n1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:29.080\n Okay, so how does memory emerge?\n\n1:23:29.080 --> 1:23:34.080\n How does the temporal stickiness of objects emerge?\n\n1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:42.000\n I'm gonna take a very chemocentric point of view\n\n1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000\n because I can't imagine any other way of doing it.\n\n1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.040\n You could think of other ways maybe.\n\n1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:52.120\n But I would say heterogeneity in matter\n\n1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:53.400\n is where the memory...\n\n1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:55.560\n So you must have enough different ways\n\n1:23:55.560 --> 1:23:58.560\n of rearranging matter for there to be a memory.\n\n1:23:58.560 --> 1:23:59.400\n So what that means,\n\n1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:01.080\n if you've got particles colliding in a box,\n\n1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:05.920\n let's just take some elements in a box.\n\n1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:10.320\n Those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of ways.\n\n1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:11.840\n So there's a combinatorial explosion\n\n1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:15.320\n of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects,\n\n1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:17.000\n bonds being made.\n\n1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.360\n Because there's such a large number,\n\n1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:22.280\n the population of different objects that are possible,\n\n1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:23.800\n this goes back to assembly theory\n\n1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:27.480\n where assembly theory, there's four types of universes.\n\n1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:30.840\n So you've got basically, and this is what one was up earlier\n\n1:24:30.840 --> 1:24:33.520\n where one universe where you've just got\n\n1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:34.480\n everything is possible.\n\n1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:35.600\n So you can take all the atoms\n\n1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:37.480\n and combine them and make everything.\n\n1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:42.360\n Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial\n\n1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:46.000\n where you basically have to accrue information in steps.\n\n1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.240\n Then you've got assembly observed,\n\n1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:51.520\n and then you've got the object assembly going back.\n\n1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:53.640\n So what I'm trying to say is like,\n\n1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:55.400\n if you can take atoms and make bonds,\n\n1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:57.440\n let's say you take a nitrogen atom and add it\n\n1:24:57.440 --> 1:24:59.600\n to a carbon atom, you find an amino acid,\n\n1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:01.000\n then you add another carbon atom on\n\n1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.160\n in a particular configuration,\n\n1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:04.280\n then another one, all different molecules.\n\n1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:07.720\n They all represent different histories.\n\n1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:10.200\n So I would say for me right now,\n\n1:25:10.200 --> 1:25:13.160\n the most simple route into life seems to be\n\n1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:16.080\n through recording memories and chemistry.\n\n1:25:16.080 --> 1:25:18.200\n But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways\n\n1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.680\n and can't be other emergent effects.\n\n1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:22.520\n But I think if you can make bonds\n\n1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:24.240\n and lots of different bonds,\n\n1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:29.240\n and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future.\n\n1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:31.200\n So imagine a box of atoms,\n\n1:25:32.520 --> 1:25:35.000\n and then you combine those atoms in some way.\n\n1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:40.000\n So you make molecule A from load of atoms,\n\n1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:43.160\n and then molecule A can go back to the box\n\n1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:44.960\n and influence the box.\n\n1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:49.720\n Then you make A prime or AB or ABC.\n\n1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.160\n And that process keeps going,\n\n1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:53.240\n and that's where the memories come from,\n\n1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:57.160\n is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding.\n\n1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:58.000\n I don't know if that makes any sense.\n\n1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:03.000\n And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level.\n\n1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:05.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:09.160\n So the physicists have no, like not enough.\n\n1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:11.000\n Yeah, I mean.\n\n1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.040\n They're like desperately begging\n\n1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:20.040\n for more freedom and heterogeneous components to play with.\n\n1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:23.120\n Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:24.760\n What do you think about that, Sarah?\n\n1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:26.800\n I mentioned already, I think it's significant\n\n1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:28.560\n that whatever physics governs life\n\n1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.120\n emerges actually in chemistry.\n\n1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:32.880\n It's not relevant at the subatomic scale\n\n1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:34.920\n or even at the atomic scale.\n\n1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:37.960\n It's in, well, atomic scale because chemistry.\n\n1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:40.880\n But like when you get into this combinatorial diversity\n\n1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:44.400\n that you get from combining things on the periodic table,\n\n1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:47.600\n that's when selection actually matters\n\n1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:49.000\n or the fact that some things can exist\n\n1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.080\n and others can't exist actually starts to matter.\n\n1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:55.840\n So I think of it like you don't study gravity\n\n1:26:55.840 --> 1:26:57.120\n inside the atomic nucleus.\n\n1:26:57.120 --> 1:26:59.000\n You study it in terms of large scale structure\n\n1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.320\n of the universe or black holes or things like that.\n\n1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:04.320\n And whatever we're talking about as physics of information\n\n1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:06.160\n or physics of assembly becomes relevant\n\n1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:08.040\n at a certain scale of reality.\n\n1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:11.080\n And the transition that you're talking about,\n\n1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:15.120\n I would think of as just when you get a sufficient density\n\n1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:16.840\n in terms of the assembly space\n\n1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:18.560\n of like the relationship of the overlap\n\n1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:20.680\n and the assembly space,\n\n1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:23.200\n which is like a feature of common memory,\n\n1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:27.560\n there is this transition to assembly dominated physics,\n\n1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:29.000\n whatever that is.\n\n1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:30.480\n Oh, like when we're talking about,\n\n1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:31.920\n and we're trying to map out exactly\n\n1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:33.120\n what that transition looks like.\n\n1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:36.240\n We're pretty sure of some of its features,\n\n1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:37.720\n but we haven't done all of the...\n\n1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:39.560\n Do you think if you were there in the early universe,\n\n1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:41.080\n you would have been able to predict\n\n1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:43.200\n the emergence of chemistry and biology?\n\n1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:46.880\n And I ask that because at this stage as humans,\n\n1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:51.280\n do you think we can possibly predict the length of memory\n\n1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:55.640\n that might be able to be formed later on\n\n1:27:55.640 --> 1:27:56.920\n in this pocket of the universe?\n\n1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:01.920\n Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?\n\n1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:04.920\n I think as much time as you have in the past\n\n1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:06.800\n is how much you can predict in the future.\n\n1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:09.400\n Because it's actually physical in the system\n\n1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:10.840\n and you have to have enough time\n\n1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:15.840\n for features of that structure to exist.\n\n1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:17.360\n Wait, let me push back on that.\n\n1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:19.920\n Isn't there somewhere in the universe\n\n1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:21.900\n that's like a shortest path that's been,\n\n1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:23.920\n that stretches all the way to the beginning?\n\n1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:24.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:26.720\n That's building some giant monster?\n\n1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:27.720\n Maybe, yeah.\n\n1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:28.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:29.400\n So you can't predict.\n\n1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:30.560\n The universe has as much memory\n\n1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:32.520\n as the largest assembly object in the universe.\n\n1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:33.360\n Yeah. Right.\n\n1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:35.320\n But so you can't predict.\n\n1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:37.480\n You can't predict any deeper than that, no.\n\n1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:38.320\n Right.\n\n1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:40.800\n So like that, I guess what I'm saying is,\n\n1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:43.560\n like what intuition do you have about complexity\n\n1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:46.280\n living in the world that you'd have today?\n\n1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:49.040\n Right, because you just, you can,\n\n1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:54.040\n I mean I guess how long does it get more fun?\n\n1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:55.880\n Like isn't there gonna be at some point,\n\n1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:57.960\n because there's a heat death in the universe,\n\n1:28:57.960 --> 1:29:01.760\n isn't there going to be a point of the most,\n\n1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:04.320\n of the highest assembly of object,\n\n1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:07.080\n with the highest probability being generated?\n\n1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:08.560\n When is the universe gonna be the most fun,\n\n1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:10.160\n and can we freeze ourselves and then live then?\n\n1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:11.000\n Exactly.\n\n1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:14.280\n And will you know when you're having the most fun\n\n1:29:14.280 --> 1:29:16.800\n that this is the best time, you're in your prime?\n\n1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:18.080\n Are you going to do what everyone does,\n\n1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:19.920\n which is deny that you're in your prime,\n\n1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:21.840\n and the best years are still ahead of you?\n\n1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:23.160\n I don't know.\n\n1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:24.400\n What option do you have?\n\n1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:29.760\n I don't, I mean the problem is there's lots of,\n\n1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:31.360\n lots of really interesting features here.\n\n1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:33.600\n I just wanna mention one thing that might be,\n\n1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:36.160\n is I do think assembly theory applies all the way back\n\n1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:37.800\n to subatomic particles.\n\n1:29:37.800 --> 1:29:40.360\n And I also think that cosmological selection\n\n1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:42.720\n might've been actually, there might've been,\n\n1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:43.840\n I would say it's a really boring bit,\n\n1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:45.960\n but it's really important for a cosmologist\n\n1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:47.600\n that universes have gone through.\n\n1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:49.400\n Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?\n\n1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:50.760\n Maybe that there is this,\n\n1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:52.200\n that basically a universe evolves,\n\n1:29:52.200 --> 1:29:54.920\n you've got the wrong constants, we'll start again.\n\n1:29:54.920 --> 1:29:56.280\n And the most productive constants\n\n1:29:56.280 --> 1:29:59.120\n where you can allow particles to form in a certain way,\n\n1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:01.160\n propagate to the next universe, and we go again.\n\n1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:03.200\n So actually selection goes all the way back,\n\n1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:04.720\n and there's this cycle of universes.\n\n1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:06.560\n And now this universe has been selected\n\n1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:10.400\n because life can occur, and it carries on.\n\n1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:12.480\n But I've really butchered that.\n\n1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:13.320\n There is a much more.\n\n1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:17.480\n So this is some aspect where through the selection process\n\n1:30:17.480 --> 1:30:19.320\n there's parameters that are being fine tuned,\n\n1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:20.680\n and we happen to be living in one\n\n1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:22.840\n where there's some level of fine tuning.\n\n1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:27.560\n Is there, given that, can you steel man the case\n\n1:30:27.560 --> 1:30:31.280\n that we humans are alone in the universe?\n\n1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:34.960\n We are the highest assembly index object in the universe.\n\n1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:36.160\n Yeah, I can, I guess.\n\n1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:37.280\n Sad though.\n\n1:30:37.280 --> 1:30:38.120\n I mean, so from a.\n\n1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:39.200\n Is it possible?\n\n1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:41.440\n Yes, it's possible.\n\n1:30:41.440 --> 1:30:43.320\n Let's assume.\n\n1:30:43.320 --> 1:30:44.280\n Well, we know.\n\n1:30:45.240 --> 1:30:46.440\n I mean, it's possible.\n\n1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:50.880\n So let me, so okay, so there is a particular\n\n1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.680\n set of elements on Earth in a particular ratio,\n\n1:30:54.920 --> 1:30:57.360\n and the right gravitational constant,\n\n1:30:57.360 --> 1:30:59.720\n and the right viscosity, you know,\n\n1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:01.800\n of stuff being able to move around,\n\n1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:04.280\n the right distance from our sun,\n\n1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:06.720\n right number of events where we have a moon,\n\n1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:09.120\n the Earth is rotating.\n\n1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:14.080\n The late heavy bombardment produced a lot of,\n\n1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:16.040\n brought in the right stuff.\n\n1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:19.920\n And Mars was cooking up, you know,\n\n1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:21.360\n the right molecules first.\n\n1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:23.280\n So it was habitable before Earth.\n\n1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:25.920\n It was actually doing the combinatorial search.\n\n1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:29.600\n And before Mars kind of became uninhabitable,\n\n1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:34.600\n it seeded Earth with the right molecular replicators.\n\n1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:36.360\n And there was just the right stuff on Earth,\n\n1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:39.240\n and that's how the miracle of life occurred.\n\n1:31:40.680 --> 1:31:43.440\n Although I find I'm very uncomfortable with that\n\n1:31:43.440 --> 1:31:48.240\n because actually, because life came so quickly\n\n1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:49.600\n in the Earth's past.\n\n1:31:50.680 --> 1:31:55.560\n But that doesn't mean that life is easy elsewhere.\n\n1:31:55.560 --> 1:31:57.880\n It just might mean that,\n\n1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:00.160\n because chemistry is actually not a long term thing.\n\n1:32:00.160 --> 1:32:01.280\n Chemistry can happen quickly.\n\n1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:04.200\n So maybe going on with the steel manning of the argument\n\n1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:06.960\n to say actually, the fact that life emerged quickly\n\n1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:08.360\n doesn't mean that life is easy.\n\n1:32:08.360 --> 1:32:11.720\n It just means that the chemistry was right on Earth,\n\n1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:13.760\n and Earth is very special.\n\n1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:15.160\n And that's why there's no life\n\n1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:17.000\n anywhere else in the universe.\n\n1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:21.640\n Yeah, so Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing.\n\n1:32:21.640 --> 1:32:24.920\n So what if that's the reason we're lucky,\n\n1:32:24.920 --> 1:32:29.600\n is that we got to have a rare cascading of,\n\n1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:31.920\n like an accelerating cascading effect\n\n1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:34.480\n in terms of the complexity of things.\n\n1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:36.600\n So like, maybe most of the universe\n\n1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:39.720\n is trying to get sticky with the memory,\n\n1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:41.360\n and it's not able to really form it.\n\n1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:43.040\n And then we got really lucky in that.\n\n1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:44.560\n And it has nothing,\n\n1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:47.400\n like there's a lot of Earth like conditions, let's say,\n\n1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:51.640\n but it's just you really, really have to get lucky on this.\n\n1:32:51.640 --> 1:32:54.160\n But I'm doing experiments right now.\n\n1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:56.560\n In fact, experiments that Sarah and I are working on,\n\n1:32:56.560 --> 1:32:58.360\n because we have some joint funding for this,\n\n1:32:58.360 --> 1:33:00.040\n where we're seeing that the universe\n\n1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:01.440\n can get sticky really quickly.\n\n1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:04.440\n Now, of course, we're being very anthropocentric,\n\n1:33:04.440 --> 1:33:06.480\n we're using laboratory tools, we're using theory,\n\n1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:10.400\n but actually, the phenomena of selection,\n\n1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:14.120\n the process of developing heterogeneity,\n\n1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:15.080\n we can do in the lab.\n\n1:33:15.080 --> 1:33:17.640\n We're just seeing the very first hints of it.\n\n1:33:17.640 --> 1:33:22.520\n And wouldn't it be great if we can start to pin down\n\n1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:27.520\n a bit more precisely becoming good Bayesianists for this,\n\n1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:30.200\n for the origin of life and the emergence of life,\n\n1:33:30.200 --> 1:33:31.960\n to finding out what kind of chemistries\n\n1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:33.440\n we really need to look for.\n\n1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:36.080\n And I'm becoming increasingly confident\n\n1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:37.840\n we'll be able to do that in the next few years.\n\n1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:41.400\n Make life in the lab or make some selection in the lab\n\n1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:44.160\n from inorganic stuff, from sand, from rocks,\n\n1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:45.760\n from dead stuff, from moon.\n\n1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:48.040\n Wouldn't it be great to get stuff from the moon,\n\n1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:51.160\n put it in our origin of life experiment,\n\n1:33:51.160 --> 1:33:53.080\n and make moon life?\n\n1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:56.000\n And restrict ourselves to interesting self replicating\n\n1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:57.600\n stuff that we find on the moon.\n\n1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:00.680\n Sarah, what do you think about this approach\n\n1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:03.680\n of engineering life in order to understand life?\n\n1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:05.800\n So building life in the machine.\n\n1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:09.160\n Yeah, so, I mean, Lee and I are trying right now\n\n1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:14.160\n to build a vision for a large institute\n\n1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:17.640\n or experimental program, basically, to do this problem.\n\n1:34:17.640 --> 1:34:21.000\n But I think of it as like, we need to simulate a planet.\n\n1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:23.400\n So like the Large Hadron Collider was supposed\n\n1:34:23.400 --> 1:34:26.280\n to be simulating conditions just after the Big Bang.\n\n1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:27.960\n Lee's built a lot of technology in his lab\n\n1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:30.000\n to do these kind of selection engines.\n\n1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.000\n But the question you're asking is,\n\n1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:34.920\n how many experiments do you need to run?\n\n1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:37.640\n What volume of chemical space do you need to explore\n\n1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:40.640\n before you actually see an event?\n\n1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:41.880\n And I like to make an analogy\n\n1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:43.680\n to one of my favorite particle physics experiments,\n\n1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:45.280\n which is Super Kamiakande that's looking\n\n1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:46.640\n for the decay of the proton.\n\n1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:49.080\n So this is something that we predicted theoretically,\n\n1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:51.200\n but we've never observed in our universe.\n\n1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:53.320\n And basically what they're doing is every time\n\n1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:55.360\n they don't see a proton decay event,\n\n1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:57.760\n they have a longer bound on the lifetime of a proton.\n\n1:34:57.760 --> 1:35:00.720\n So imagine we built an experiment with the idea in mind\n\n1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:03.600\n of trying to simulate planetary conditions,\n\n1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:04.480\n physically simulate.\n\n1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:06.320\n You can't simulate origin life in a computer.\n\n1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:08.400\n You have to do it in an experiment.\n\n1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:10.880\n Simulate enough planetary conditions\n\n1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:12.800\n to explore the space of what's possible\n\n1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:15.040\n and bound the probability for an origin life event.\n\n1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:16.200\n Even if you're not observing it,\n\n1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:17.520\n you can talk about the probability.\n\n1:35:17.520 --> 1:35:22.520\n But we, hopefully, life is not exponentially rare\n\n1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.160\n and we would then be able to evolve\n\n1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:31.760\n in an automated system alien life in the lab.\n\n1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:34.240\n And if we can do that, then we understand the physics\n\n1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:35.880\n as well as we understand what we can do\n\n1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:37.480\n in particle accelerators.\n\n1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:40.640\n So keep expanding physically the simulation,\n\n1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:44.560\n the physical simulation, until something happens.\n\n1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:46.540\n Yeah, or just build a big enough volume\n\n1:35:46.540 --> 1:35:48.600\n of chemical experiments and evolve them.\n\n1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:50.840\n So if you say volume, you mean like literally volume?\n\n1:35:50.840 --> 1:35:53.280\n I mean physical volume in terms of space,\n\n1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:54.720\n but I actually mean volume in terms\n\n1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:57.480\n of the combinatorial space of chemistry.\n\n1:35:57.480 --> 1:35:58.300\n So like.\n\n1:35:58.300 --> 1:36:01.640\n How do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration,\n\n1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:05.520\n the search space, such that it's always like\n\n1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:08.040\n you keep grabbing the low hanging fruit?\n\n1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:10.520\n Yeah, how do you build a search engine for chemistry?\n\n1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:11.620\n It's like for aliens. I think you explained it really well.\n\n1:36:11.620 --> 1:36:12.460\n We should carry on doing this.\n\n1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:14.400\n I should pretend the physics, be the physicist,\n\n1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:15.240\n you be the chemist.\n\n1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:18.800\n So the way to do it is I will always play a joke.\n\n1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:23.800\n Cause I like writing grants to ask for money\n\n1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:24.760\n to do cool stuff.\n\n1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:29.080\n But years ago I started wanting to build.\n\n1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:30.740\n So I actually wanted the weather.\n\n1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:32.880\n So I built this robot in my lab called the computer,\n\n1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:35.480\n which is this robot you can program to do chemistry.\n\n1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:37.520\n Now it's a pro.\n\n1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:39.640\n I made a programming language for the computer\n\n1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:43.620\n and made it operate chemical equipment.\n\n1:36:43.620 --> 1:36:46.060\n Originally I wrote grants to say,\n\n1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:48.980\n Hey, I want to make an origin of life system.\n\n1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:51.740\n And no one would give me any money for this.\n\n1:36:51.740 --> 1:36:53.540\n They said, what this is ridiculous.\n\n1:36:53.540 --> 1:36:55.220\n Why are you wanting to make, oh, it's really hard.\n\n1:36:55.220 --> 1:36:56.140\n It takes forever.\n\n1:36:56.140 --> 1:36:58.380\n You're not a very good origin of life chemist anyway.\n\n1:36:58.380 --> 1:37:00.140\n Why would we give you any money?\n\n1:37:00.140 --> 1:37:02.340\n And so I turned it around and said, can you,\n\n1:37:02.340 --> 1:37:05.580\n can instead, can you give me money to make robots,\n\n1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.400\n to make molecules are interesting.\n\n1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:09.540\n And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that.\n\n1:37:09.540 --> 1:37:13.540\n And that's, so actually the funny thing is the computer\n\n1:37:13.540 --> 1:37:18.260\n project, which I have in my lab, which is very briefly,\n\n1:37:18.260 --> 1:37:20.300\n it's just basically, it's like literally an automated\n\n1:37:20.300 --> 1:37:21.140\n test tube.\n\n1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:22.960\n And we've made a programming language for the test tube,\n\n1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:27.960\n which is cool, has come as literally came from this.\n\n1:37:28.700 --> 1:37:29.720\n I went to my lab one day.\n\n1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:32.140\n So I want to make a search engine to get origin of life\n\n1:37:32.140 --> 1:37:33.580\n because they don't have a planet.\n\n1:37:33.580 --> 1:37:36.220\n And I thought about doing in a microfluidic format.\n\n1:37:36.220 --> 1:37:39.580\n So microfluidic is very nano, very small channels\n\n1:37:39.580 --> 1:37:41.660\n in device where you can basically have all the pipes\n\n1:37:41.660 --> 1:37:43.940\n lit dump produced by lithography.\n\n1:37:43.940 --> 1:37:46.700\n And you can have a chamber, maybe say between say 10\n\n1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:48.420\n and a hundred microns in volume.\n\n1:37:48.420 --> 1:37:50.580\n And we slot them all together like Lego,\n\n1:37:50.580 --> 1:37:52.860\n and we can make an origin of life system.\n\n1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:55.380\n And I could never get it to work.\n\n1:37:55.380 --> 1:37:59.340\n And I realized I had to make, do chemistry at the kind of\n\n1:37:59.340 --> 1:38:03.140\n test tube level and what you want to be able to do.\n\n1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:06.420\n Yeah, it goes back to that tweet in 1981.\n\n1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:10.220\n 1981, the computer, we're looking at a tweet from Lee.\n\n1:38:10.220 --> 1:38:13.700\n In 1981, the computer was a distant dream in,\n\n1:38:13.700 --> 1:38:15.980\n oh wow, this is the scientist looking back.\n\n1:38:15.980 --> 1:38:19.260\n It is the young boy who dreamed.\n\n1:38:19.260 --> 1:38:23.500\n In 2018, it was realized, spelled in a British way,\n\n1:38:23.500 --> 1:38:25.660\n realized, which is the wrong way.\n\n1:38:25.660 --> 1:38:27.900\n Yeah, I'm starting with Z, but not.\n\n1:38:27.900 --> 1:38:30.480\n So now there's a system that does the physical\n\n1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:33.100\n manifestation or whatever the programming language,\n\n1:38:34.460 --> 1:38:37.140\n the spec tells you to do.\n\n1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:40.580\n Yeah, well in 1981, I got my first computer, ZX81.\n\n1:38:40.580 --> 1:38:41.700\n What was the computer?\n\n1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:42.540\n ZX81.\n\n1:38:42.540 --> 1:38:44.180\n ZX81.\n\n1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:46.060\n Sinclair ZX81.\n\n1:38:46.060 --> 1:38:48.120\n It was, and I got a chemistry set.\n\n1:38:49.220 --> 1:38:53.420\n And I liked the chemistry set and I liked the computer\n\n1:38:53.420 --> 1:38:54.980\n and I just wanted to put them together.\n\n1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:56.580\n I thought, wouldn't it be cool if I could just use\n\n1:38:56.580 --> 1:38:58.860\n the computer to control the chemistry set.\n\n1:38:58.860 --> 1:39:00.780\n And obviously that was insane.\n\n1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:04.340\n And I was like, you know, eight years old, right?\n\n1:39:04.340 --> 1:39:06.100\n Nine years old, going on nine years old.\n\n1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:11.100\n And then I invented the computer\n\n1:39:12.500 --> 1:39:15.780\n just because I wanted to build this origin of life grid.\n\n1:39:15.780 --> 1:39:17.940\n Which is like literally a billion test tubes\n\n1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:20.880\n connected together in real time and real space,\n\n1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:23.380\n basically throwing a chemical dice.\n\n1:39:23.380 --> 1:39:24.860\n Throw dice, throw dice, throw dice.\n\n1:39:24.860 --> 1:39:26.120\n You're gonna get lucky.\n\n1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:28.300\n And that's what we, I think Sarah and I\n\n1:39:28.300 --> 1:39:30.580\n have been thinking very deeply about.\n\n1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:32.940\n Because, you know, there's more money being spent\n\n1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:37.060\n on the origin of the gravity\n\n1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:39.580\n or looking at the Higgs boson than the origin of life, right?\n\n1:39:39.580 --> 1:39:43.740\n And the origin of life is the, I think the biggest question\n\n1:39:43.740 --> 1:39:46.260\n or not the biggest question, it is a big question.\n\n1:39:46.260 --> 1:39:47.100\n Let's put it that way.\n\n1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:48.100\n It is the biggest question.\n\n1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:49.100\n You're okay saying that.\n\n1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:50.740\n Okay, all right.\n\n1:39:50.740 --> 1:39:52.940\n Isn't it possible once you figure out the origin of life\n\n1:39:52.940 --> 1:39:54.540\n that that's not going to solve,\n\n1:39:55.940 --> 1:39:58.020\n that's not actually gonna solve\n\n1:39:58.020 --> 1:39:59.700\n the question of what is life?\n\n1:39:59.700 --> 1:40:02.780\n Because you're kind of putting a lot of.\n\n1:40:02.780 --> 1:40:04.600\n Yeah, I think they're the same problem.\n\n1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:06.660\n But you're putting, is it possible\n\n1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:08.800\n that you're putting too many,\n\n1:40:09.940 --> 1:40:12.020\n too much bets into this origin part?\n\n1:40:12.020 --> 1:40:14.060\n Maybe the origin thing isn't,\n\n1:40:14.060 --> 1:40:16.460\n isn't there always a turtle underneath the turtle?\n\n1:40:16.460 --> 1:40:17.740\n Isn't there a stack of turtles?\n\n1:40:17.740 --> 1:40:19.600\n Because then if you create it in the lab,\n\n1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:21.740\n maybe you need some other stuff.\n\n1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:23.180\n Well, let's not think about the origin.\n\n1:40:23.180 --> 1:40:27.100\n Like in the lab, there's still memory.\n\n1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:28.180\n Yeah, yes.\n\n1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:29.020\n Right?\n\n1:40:29.020 --> 1:40:31.660\n So the experiment is already the product of evolution.\n\n1:40:31.660 --> 1:40:33.900\n Right, in some maybe really deep way,\n\n1:40:33.900 --> 1:40:36.060\n not an obvious way, in some very deep way.\n\n1:40:36.060 --> 1:40:39.560\n So maybe the haters are always going to be like,\n\n1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:42.140\n well, you have to reconstruct the fold.\n\n1:40:42.140 --> 1:40:42.980\n You have to build a new script.\n\n1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:44.620\n Fortunately for us, the haters are not aware\n\n1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:45.520\n of that argument.\n\n1:40:46.860 --> 1:40:48.260\n Well, no, I know, I just.\n\n1:40:48.260 --> 1:40:51.100\n We're the one making that argument usually, but yeah.\n\n1:40:51.100 --> 1:40:54.420\n I just think that if we create life in the lab,\n\n1:40:54.420 --> 1:40:56.540\n it's not obvious that you'll get\n\n1:40:56.540 --> 1:40:59.660\n to the deep, deep understanding of necessarily,\n\n1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:03.100\n what is the line between life and non life?\n\n1:41:03.100 --> 1:41:05.020\n No, I think, so there's so much here.\n\n1:41:05.020 --> 1:41:06.340\n I'm just like playing devil.\n\n1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:08.580\n So much here, but let me play devil's advocate\n\n1:41:08.580 --> 1:41:10.460\n back in a previous conversation, right?\n\n1:41:10.460 --> 1:41:14.400\n And say, yeah, I will.\n\n1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:15.240\n Why not?\n\n1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:16.060\n Why not?\n\n1:41:16.060 --> 1:41:16.900\n We've got time.\n\n1:41:16.900 --> 1:41:17.740\n Yeah, let's go.\n\n1:41:17.740 --> 1:41:18.560\n Cellular automata.\n\n1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:21.980\n Cellular automata, these very, very simple things\n\n1:41:21.980 --> 1:41:24.740\n where you color squares black or white\n\n1:41:24.740 --> 1:41:26.620\n and implement rules and play them in time.\n\n1:41:26.620 --> 1:41:30.580\n And you can get these very, very complex patterns coming out.\n\n1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:31.780\n You know, there's nice rules.\n\n1:41:31.780 --> 1:41:36.780\n There are Turing complete rules and I would argue\n\n1:41:36.860 --> 1:41:41.580\n that cellular automata don't really exist on their own.\n\n1:41:41.580 --> 1:41:45.040\n They have to exist in a computing device.\n\n1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:46.380\n If that, well, that's computing devices,\n\n1:41:46.380 --> 1:41:47.540\n a piece of paper and abstraction,\n\n1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:52.540\n a mathematician drawing a grid or a framework.\n\n1:41:52.540 --> 1:41:56.960\n Now, so I would argue CAs are beautiful things,\n\n1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:59.960\n simple, going complex, but the complexity is all borrowed\n\n1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:02.340\n from the lithography, the numbers.\n\n1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:05.160\n Right, now let's take that same argument\n\n1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:09.240\n with the chemistry experiment origin of life.\n\n1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:12.480\n What you need to be able to do is go,\n\n1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:13.720\n and I'm inspired to do this,\n\n1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.700\n to go out and look for CAs occur in nature.\n\n1:42:17.700 --> 1:42:21.840\n You know, let's kind of, let's find some CAs\n\n1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:24.800\n that just emerge in our universe and.\n\n1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:26.080\n For people just, sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:29.280\n for people just listening and in general,\n\n1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:33.480\n I think what we're looking at is a cellular automata\n\n1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:35.080\n where again, as Lee described,\n\n1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:38.360\n there is just binary black or white squares\n\n1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.200\n and they only have local information\n\n1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:42.640\n and they're born and they die.\n\n1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:45.340\n And you would think nothing interesting would emerge,\n\n1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:47.360\n but actually what we're looking at is something\n\n1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:49.360\n that I believe is called glider guns\n\n1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:54.360\n or a glider gun, which is moving objects\n\n1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:58.660\n in this multi cell space that look like they're organisms\n\n1:42:58.660 --> 1:43:01.200\n that have much more information,\n\n1:43:01.200 --> 1:43:03.780\n that have much more complexity\n\n1:43:03.780 --> 1:43:05.940\n than the individual building components.\n\n1:43:05.940 --> 1:43:08.460\n In fact, look like they have a long term memory\n\n1:43:09.860 --> 1:43:12.300\n while the individual components don't seem like\n\n1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:15.100\n they have any memory at all, which is fascinating.\n\n1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:17.940\n The argument here is that has to exist\n\n1:43:17.940 --> 1:43:20.140\n on all this layer of infrastructure, right?\n\n1:43:20.140 --> 1:43:21.620\n And though it looks simple.\n\n1:43:21.620 --> 1:43:23.260\n And then what I would make, the argument I would make\n\n1:43:23.260 --> 1:43:26.220\n if I were you, say, well, I think CAs are really simple\n\n1:43:26.220 --> 1:43:28.700\n and everywhere, is say, show me how they emerge\n\n1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:29.580\n in a substrate.\n\n1:43:29.580 --> 1:43:32.620\n Now this goes to the origin of life, machine.\n\n1:43:32.620 --> 1:43:34.980\n I don't think we want to do the origin of life,\n\n1:43:34.980 --> 1:43:36.540\n just any origin is good.\n\n1:43:36.540 --> 1:43:39.260\n So we do, so we literally have our sand shaker,\n\n1:43:39.260 --> 1:43:42.220\n shake the sand like massive grid of chemistry experiments,\n\n1:43:42.220 --> 1:43:43.880\n shaking sand, shaking whatever.\n\n1:43:45.260 --> 1:43:47.360\n And then because we know what we've put in,\n\n1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:49.380\n so we know how we've cheated and the same way with CA,\n\n1:43:49.380 --> 1:43:50.220\n we know how we've cheated,\n\n1:43:50.220 --> 1:43:52.300\n we know the number of operations needed,\n\n1:43:52.300 --> 1:43:54.580\n we know how big a grid we want to get this.\n\n1:43:54.580 --> 1:43:56.900\n If we could then say, okay,\n\n1:43:56.900 --> 1:44:01.460\n how can we generate this recipe in the lab\n\n1:44:01.460 --> 1:44:03.240\n and make a life form?\n\n1:44:03.240 --> 1:44:06.180\n What contingency did we need to put in?\n\n1:44:06.180 --> 1:44:09.380\n And we're upfront about how we cheated, okay?\n\n1:44:09.380 --> 1:44:12.180\n Say, oh, you had to shake it, it was a periodic,\n\n1:44:12.180 --> 1:44:15.780\n planet rotates, it's tried, comes in and out.\n\n1:44:15.780 --> 1:44:17.700\n So, and then we can start to basically say,\n\n1:44:17.700 --> 1:44:22.700\n okay, how difficult is it for these features to be found?\n\n1:44:23.180 --> 1:44:25.300\n And then we can look for extra planets and other features.\n\n1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:27.460\n So I think Sarah is absolutely right.\n\n1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:29.340\n We want to explain to people we're cheating.\n\n1:44:29.340 --> 1:44:30.660\n In fact, we have to cheat.\n\n1:44:30.660 --> 1:44:32.660\n No one has given, I'm good at writing grants,\n\n1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:34.060\n well, I used to be, I'm not very good right now,\n\n1:44:34.060 --> 1:44:35.260\n I keep getting rejected,\n\n1:44:35.260 --> 1:44:38.020\n but writing a grant for a planet in 100 million years,\n\n1:44:38.020 --> 1:44:39.860\n no grant fund there is going to give me that,\n\n1:44:39.860 --> 1:44:42.740\n but maybe money to make a kind of a grid,\n\n1:44:42.740 --> 1:44:45.940\n a computer grid, origin of life computer grid.\n\n1:44:45.940 --> 1:44:46.860\n In physical space.\n\n1:44:46.860 --> 1:44:49.180\n In physical space, and just do it.\n\n1:44:49.180 --> 1:44:51.180\n So Sarah said something which is,\n\n1:44:51.180 --> 1:44:56.180\n you can't simulate the origin of life in a computer,\n\n1:44:56.320 --> 1:44:59.580\n so like in simulation, why not?\n\n1:44:59.580 --> 1:45:02.380\n What are your, you said it very confidently,\n\n1:45:02.380 --> 1:45:07.060\n so is it possible and why would it be very difficult?\n\n1:45:07.060 --> 1:45:08.880\n Like what's your intuition there?\n\n1:45:08.880 --> 1:45:12.120\n I think it's very difficult right now\n\n1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.140\n because we don't know the physics,\n\n1:45:13.140 --> 1:45:15.220\n but if you go based on principles of assembly theory\n\n1:45:15.220 --> 1:45:17.340\n and you think every molecule is actually\n\n1:45:17.340 --> 1:45:20.100\n a very large causal graph, not just the molecule,\n\n1:45:20.100 --> 1:45:21.560\n then you have to simulate all the features\n\n1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:22.580\n of those causal graphs,\n\n1:45:22.580 --> 1:45:24.820\n and I think it becomes computationally intractable.\n\n1:45:24.820 --> 1:45:26.900\n You might as well just build the experiment.\n\n1:45:26.900 --> 1:45:28.660\n Because you have, in the physical space,\n\n1:45:28.660 --> 1:45:31.660\n you have all the objects with all the memories.\n\n1:45:31.660 --> 1:45:32.500\n Yes.\n\n1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:35.400\n In the computer, you would have to copy them\n\n1:45:35.400 --> 1:45:36.240\n or reconstruct them.\n\n1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:37.060\n Yes.\n\n1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:38.620\n Yeah, that's a beautifully put,\n\n1:45:38.620 --> 1:45:41.700\n and I would say that lots of people,\n\n1:45:41.700 --> 1:45:44.980\n you just don't have enough resources.\n\n1:45:44.980 --> 1:45:47.940\n It's easier to actually do the physical experiment\n\n1:45:47.940 --> 1:45:49.820\n because we are literally,\n\n1:45:49.820 --> 1:45:51.380\n I would view the physical experiment\n\n1:45:51.380 --> 1:45:53.540\n almost like a computational experiment.\n\n1:45:53.540 --> 1:45:55.060\n We're just outsourcing, it's just basically,\n\n1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:57.700\n we're just outsourcing all the matrix algebra.\n\n1:45:57.700 --> 1:46:00.180\n And on your point about the experiment\n\n1:46:00.180 --> 1:46:03.940\n being also an example of life,\n\n1:46:03.940 --> 1:46:05.340\n it's almost like you want to design,\n\n1:46:05.340 --> 1:46:08.420\n it's like all of us are lineages\n\n1:46:08.420 --> 1:46:10.300\n of propagating information across time,\n\n1:46:10.300 --> 1:46:12.300\n and so everything we do becomes part of life\n\n1:46:12.300 --> 1:46:14.180\n because it's part of that causal chain.\n\n1:46:14.180 --> 1:46:15.900\n So it's like you want to try to pinch off\n\n1:46:15.900 --> 1:46:17.740\n as much as you can of the information\n\n1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:20.220\n from your causal chain that goes into the experiment,\n\n1:46:20.220 --> 1:46:21.980\n but you can't pinch off all of it\n\n1:46:21.980 --> 1:46:23.700\n to move it to a different timeline.\n\n1:46:23.700 --> 1:46:25.300\n It's always going to be part of your timeline.\n\n1:46:25.300 --> 1:46:26.360\n But at least if you can control\n\n1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:27.460\n how much information you put in,\n\n1:46:27.460 --> 1:46:30.540\n you can try to see how much does that particular trajectory\n\n1:46:30.540 --> 1:46:33.940\n you've set up start generating its own assembly.\n\n1:46:33.940 --> 1:46:36.100\n So you know where it starts,\n\n1:46:36.100 --> 1:46:38.700\n and then you want to try to see it take off on its own\n\n1:46:38.700 --> 1:46:41.140\n when you try to pinch it off as much as possible.\n\n1:46:42.140 --> 1:46:43.700\n Got it.\n\n1:46:43.700 --> 1:46:45.260\n Quick pause, bathroom break.\n\n1:46:45.260 --> 1:46:46.100\n Yes.\n\n1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:47.580\n All right, cool.\n\n1:46:47.580 --> 1:46:49.540\n And now we're back.\n\n1:46:49.540 --> 1:46:50.940\n All right.\n\n1:46:50.940 --> 1:46:53.580\n We talked about the early days of the universe\n\n1:46:53.580 --> 1:46:55.940\n when there was just stuff and no memory,\n\n1:46:55.940 --> 1:46:57.260\n not even causality.\n\n1:46:57.260 --> 1:46:58.580\n I think Lee at least implied\n\n1:46:58.580 --> 1:47:00.580\n that causality is immersion somehow.\n\n1:47:00.580 --> 1:47:01.940\n We could discuss this.\n\n1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:06.940\n What happened before this all originated?\n\n1:47:06.940 --> 1:47:09.080\n What's outside the universe?\n\n1:47:10.660 --> 1:47:12.140\n Divided by zero.\n\n1:47:12.140 --> 1:47:16.380\n Okay, so it's not relevant, not understandable.\n\n1:47:16.380 --> 1:47:18.580\n Is it useful to even ask the question?\n\n1:47:18.580 --> 1:47:19.420\n No.\n\n1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:22.220\n Just because it's so hard?\n\n1:47:22.220 --> 1:47:23.380\n No, it's not hard.\n\n1:47:23.380 --> 1:47:24.860\n It's just not a question.\n\n1:47:24.860 --> 1:47:27.300\n If I can't do an experiment or even think of an experiment,\n\n1:47:27.300 --> 1:47:28.620\n the question doesn't exist.\n\n1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:32.360\n Well, no, you can't think of a lot of experiments,\n\n1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:33.200\n no offense.\n\n1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:35.060\n What I mean is I can't.\n\n1:47:35.060 --> 1:47:36.860\n Your causality graph is like,\n\n1:47:36.860 --> 1:47:38.980\n this is what we're talking about.\n\n1:47:38.980 --> 1:47:43.980\n It's like there is limits to your ability\n\n1:47:43.980 --> 1:47:45.700\n to construct experiments.\n\n1:47:45.700 --> 1:47:48.300\n I agree, but I was trying to be facetious\n\n1:47:48.300 --> 1:47:49.300\n and I'm trying to make a point\n\n1:47:49.300 --> 1:47:54.300\n because I think that if there is a causal bottleneck\n\n1:47:56.660 --> 1:48:00.140\n through which information can't propagate in principle,\n\n1:48:00.140 --> 1:48:03.940\n then it's very hard to think of an experiment,\n\n1:48:03.940 --> 1:48:05.460\n even in principle, even one that's beyond\n\n1:48:05.460 --> 1:48:08.620\n my mediocre intellect, right?\n\n1:48:08.620 --> 1:48:09.460\n Which is fine.\n\n1:48:09.460 --> 1:48:10.900\n I'm happy to accept that.\n\n1:48:10.900 --> 1:48:12.860\n But this is one of the things I actually do think\n\n1:48:12.860 --> 1:48:14.860\n there was something before the Big Bang\n\n1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:17.580\n because I would say that I think the Big Bang\n\n1:48:17.580 --> 1:48:19.540\n just couldn't occur and create time.\n\n1:48:19.540 --> 1:48:21.240\n Time created the Big Bang.\n\n1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:23.420\n So there was time before the Big Bang.\n\n1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:24.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:24.260 --> 1:48:25.420\n There was no space, but there was time.\n\n1:48:25.420 --> 1:48:26.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:26.740 --> 1:48:27.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:27.700 --> 1:48:29.620\n But I mean, I'm just making that stuff up\n\n1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:31.020\n just to make all the physicists happy,\n\n1:48:31.020 --> 1:48:32.580\n but I think it's...\n\n1:48:32.580 --> 1:48:33.860\n Do you think that would make them happy\n\n1:48:33.860 --> 1:48:35.780\n because they would be quite upset, actually.\n\n1:48:35.780 --> 1:48:37.100\n And why would they be upset?\n\n1:48:37.100 --> 1:48:40.780\n Because they would say that time can't exist\n\n1:48:40.780 --> 1:48:41.620\n before the Big Bang.\n\n1:48:41.620 --> 1:48:43.540\n Yeah, I mean, this goes back to an argument\n\n1:48:43.540 --> 1:48:46.220\n that you might not want to have the argument here.\n\n1:48:46.220 --> 1:48:48.500\n I was talking to Sarah earlier today\n\n1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:51.380\n about an argument we had about time a long time ago.\n\n1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:52.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:52.220 --> 1:48:53.040\n A long time in time.\n\n1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:55.680\n And what I would, it's like, I think there is this thing\n\n1:48:55.680 --> 1:48:57.260\n called time or state creation.\n\n1:48:57.260 --> 1:49:00.980\n The universe is creating states and it's outside of space,\n\n1:49:00.980 --> 1:49:02.180\n but they create space.\n\n1:49:02.180 --> 1:49:04.180\n So what I mean is you can imagine there are states\n\n1:49:04.180 --> 1:49:05.860\n being created all the time.\n\n1:49:05.860 --> 1:49:08.380\n And there is this thing called time.\n\n1:49:08.380 --> 1:49:11.100\n Time is a clock, which you can use to measure\n\n1:49:11.100 --> 1:49:13.980\n when things happen, but that doesn't mean,\n\n1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:15.200\n because you can't measure something,\n\n1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:17.220\n that states aren't being created.\n\n1:49:17.220 --> 1:49:22.220\n And so you might locally refer to the Big Bang\n\n1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:25.780\n and the Big Bang occurred at some point\n\n1:49:25.780 --> 1:49:27.480\n when those states were there.\n\n1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:28.880\n Probably there had to be enough states\n\n1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:30.740\n for the Big Bang to occur.\n\n1:49:30.740 --> 1:49:34.580\n And then, but I think that there is something wrong\n\n1:49:34.580 --> 1:49:37.020\n with our conception of how the universe was created\n\n1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:40.820\n and the Big Bang because we don't really get time.\n\n1:49:40.820 --> 1:49:44.140\n Because again, I don't want to become boring\n\n1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:48.980\n and sound like a broken record, but time is a real thing.\n\n1:49:48.980 --> 1:49:52.740\n And until I can really explain that more elegantly,\n\n1:49:52.740 --> 1:49:54.260\n I'm just gonna get into more trouble.\n\n1:49:54.260 --> 1:49:55.860\n Well, we're gonna talk about time\n\n1:49:55.860 --> 1:49:59.420\n because time is a useful measuring device for experiments,\n\n1:49:59.420 --> 1:50:02.180\n but also time is an ideal, okay.\n\n1:50:02.180 --> 1:50:05.460\n But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think?\n\n1:50:05.460 --> 1:50:07.860\n Is it a useful question to ask what happened\n\n1:50:07.860 --> 1:50:08.860\n before the Big Bang?\n\n1:50:08.860 --> 1:50:13.200\n Is it a useful question to ask what's outside the universe?\n\n1:50:14.940 --> 1:50:17.660\n So I would think about it as the Big Bang\n\n1:50:17.660 --> 1:50:19.620\n is an event that we reconstructed\n\n1:50:19.620 --> 1:50:21.900\n as probably happening in the past of our universe\n\n1:50:21.900 --> 1:50:24.220\n based on current observational data.\n\n1:50:24.220 --> 1:50:25.940\n And so the way I like to think about it\n\n1:50:25.940 --> 1:50:30.940\n is we exist locally in something called the universe.\n\n1:50:33.020 --> 1:50:35.880\n So, and going back to like the physics of existence,\n\n1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:39.140\n we exist locally in the space of all things that could exist\n\n1:50:39.140 --> 1:50:42.300\n and we can infer certain properties of the structure\n\n1:50:42.300 --> 1:50:43.560\n of where we exist locally.\n\n1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:46.020\n And one of the properties that we've inferred in the past\n\n1:50:46.020 --> 1:50:50.820\n is that there is a thing we call the Big Bang.\n\n1:50:50.820 --> 1:50:52.940\n There's some signatures of our local environment\n\n1:50:52.940 --> 1:50:57.380\n that indicate that there was a very low information event\n\n1:50:58.740 --> 1:50:59.920\n that started our universe.\n\n1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:02.040\n I think that's actually just an artifact\n\n1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:05.120\n of the structure of the assembly space\n\n1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:10.120\n that when you start losing all the memory in the objects,\n\n1:51:10.220 --> 1:51:12.380\n it looks like what we call a Big Bang.\n\n1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:14.880\n So I think it makes sense to talk about\n\n1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:16.300\n where you are locally.\n\n1:51:16.300 --> 1:51:18.220\n I think it makes sense to talk about\n\n1:51:18.220 --> 1:51:20.260\n counterfactual possibilities,\n\n1:51:20.260 --> 1:51:22.100\n what could exist outside the universe\n\n1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:24.780\n in the sense that they become part of our reasoning\n\n1:51:24.780 --> 1:51:26.380\n and therefore part of our causal chain\n\n1:51:26.380 --> 1:51:27.660\n of things that we can do.\n\n1:51:28.500 --> 1:51:31.700\n So like the multiverse in my mind exists,\n\n1:51:31.700 --> 1:51:33.360\n but it doesn't exist as a multiverse\n\n1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:34.540\n of possible universes.\n\n1:51:34.540 --> 1:51:36.260\n It exists as an idea in our minds\n\n1:51:36.260 --> 1:51:38.380\n that allows us to reason about how physics works\n\n1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:39.560\n and then to do physics differently\n\n1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:42.100\n because we reason about it that way.\n\n1:51:42.100 --> 1:51:47.100\n So I always like to recenter it on things exist,\n\n1:51:47.220 --> 1:51:50.460\n but they don't always exist like we think they exist.\n\n1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:53.100\n So when we're thinking about things outside the universe,\n\n1:51:53.100 --> 1:51:55.380\n they absolutely exist because we're thinking about them,\n\n1:51:55.380 --> 1:51:59.780\n but they don't look like the projections in our minds.\n\n1:51:59.780 --> 1:52:00.620\n They're something else.\n\n1:52:00.620 --> 1:52:02.100\n And something you said just gave an idea\n\n1:52:02.100 --> 1:52:04.620\n to go back to your question.\n\n1:52:04.620 --> 1:52:09.620\n If there was, I mean, if something caused the Big Bang,\n\n1:52:09.740 --> 1:52:12.180\n if there was some memory or some artifact of that,\n\n1:52:12.180 --> 1:52:13.780\n then of course, to answer your question,\n\n1:52:13.780 --> 1:52:15.260\n it's worth going back to that\n\n1:52:15.260 --> 1:52:17.460\n because that would imply there is something\n\n1:52:17.460 --> 1:52:19.660\n beyond that barrier, that filter.\n\n1:52:19.660 --> 1:52:21.780\n And that's what you were saying, I guess, right?\n\n1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:23.820\n I'm agnostic to what exists outside the universe.\n\n1:52:23.820 --> 1:52:24.860\n I just don't think that.\n\n1:52:24.860 --> 1:52:26.900\n I think the most interesting things for us to be doing\n\n1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:31.020\n are finding explanations that allow us to do more,\n\n1:52:31.020 --> 1:52:32.620\n like that optimism.\n\n1:52:32.620 --> 1:52:35.540\n So I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask\n\n1:52:35.540 --> 1:52:38.100\n as being scientific ones because I find\n\n1:52:38.100 --> 1:52:40.660\n that that's where the most creative potential is\n\n1:52:40.660 --> 1:52:42.660\n to impact the future trajectory\n\n1:52:42.660 --> 1:52:43.940\n of what we're doing on this planet.\n\n1:52:43.940 --> 1:52:45.540\n It's an interesting thing about the Big Bang\n\n1:52:45.540 --> 1:52:48.700\n is basically from our current perspective\n\n1:52:48.700 --> 1:52:50.820\n of what we're able to detect,\n\n1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:52.980\n it's the time when things were forgotten.\n\n1:52:52.980 --> 1:52:54.220\n Yes.\n\n1:52:54.220 --> 1:52:58.500\n It's the time to reset from our limited perspective.\n\n1:52:58.500 --> 1:53:01.860\n And so the question is, is it useful to ever study\n\n1:53:01.860 --> 1:53:03.460\n the thing that was forgotten?\n\n1:53:05.100 --> 1:53:07.500\n Or should we focus just on the memories\n\n1:53:07.500 --> 1:53:08.340\n that are still there?\n\n1:53:08.340 --> 1:53:10.140\n Well, the point I was trying to make about the experiment\n\n1:53:10.140 --> 1:53:11.780\n is I was trying to say both things.\n\n1:53:11.780 --> 1:53:14.180\n And I think perhaps yes, from the portfolio point of view,\n\n1:53:14.180 --> 1:53:17.580\n if you could then imagine what was forgotten\n\n1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:19.180\n and then work forwards,\n\n1:53:19.180 --> 1:53:20.900\n you will have different consequences.\n\n1:53:20.900 --> 1:53:22.660\n So then it becomes testable.\n\n1:53:22.660 --> 1:53:24.700\n So as long as we can find tests,\n\n1:53:24.700 --> 1:53:26.420\n then it's definitely worth thinking about.\n\n1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:28.380\n What I don't like is when physicists say\n\n1:53:28.380 --> 1:53:29.740\n what happened before the Big Bang\n\n1:53:29.740 --> 1:53:31.220\n and before, before, before,\n\n1:53:31.220 --> 1:53:34.620\n without giving me any credible conjecture\n\n1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:38.260\n about how would we know the difference?\n\n1:53:38.260 --> 1:53:39.700\n But the way you framed it is quite nice.\n\n1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:40.540\n I like that.\n\n1:53:40.540 --> 1:53:43.540\n It's like, what have we forgotten?\n\n1:53:43.540 --> 1:53:47.700\n Is there room for God in assembly theory?\n\n1:53:47.700 --> 1:53:48.580\n Who's God?\n\n1:53:49.620 --> 1:53:52.740\n I like arguments for a necessary being better than God.\n\n1:53:52.740 --> 1:53:53.580\n Well, I think I said it earlier.\n\n1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:54.420\n What's a necessary being?\n\n1:53:54.420 --> 1:53:55.260\n What's a necessary?\n\n1:53:55.260 --> 1:53:56.660\n Like something that has to exist.\n\n1:53:58.340 --> 1:54:01.140\n Oh, so you like, I mean, you like the shortest path.\n\n1:54:01.140 --> 1:54:02.220\n Like does God need?\n\n1:54:02.220 --> 1:54:03.060\n No, no, no.\n\n1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:05.540\n I mean, well, you can go back to like Thomas Aquinas\n\n1:54:05.540 --> 1:54:08.740\n and arguments for the existence of God.\n\n1:54:08.740 --> 1:54:11.860\n But I think most of the interesting theological arguments\n\n1:54:11.860 --> 1:54:14.900\n are always about whether something has to exist\n\n1:54:14.900 --> 1:54:17.140\n or there was a first thing that had to exist.\n\n1:54:17.140 --> 1:54:19.020\n But I think there's a lot of logical loopholes\n\n1:54:19.020 --> 1:54:19.940\n in those kind of arguments.\n\n1:54:19.940 --> 1:54:23.100\n Well, so God here, meaning the machine\n\n1:54:24.140 --> 1:54:29.140\n that creates, that generates the stuff.\n\n1:54:29.340 --> 1:54:31.500\n But God, so what I was trying to say earlier is that.\n\n1:54:31.500 --> 1:54:32.660\n Isn't that just the universe though?\n\n1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:33.500\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:54:33.500 --> 1:54:36.580\n Well, yeah, well, but there's a difference between,\n\n1:54:36.580 --> 1:54:40.420\n I sort of imagine like a black box, like a machine.\n\n1:54:40.420 --> 1:54:41.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:41.260 --> 1:54:44.420\n I mean, I would be more comfortable calling that God\n\n1:54:44.420 --> 1:54:45.260\n because it's a machine.\n\n1:54:45.260 --> 1:54:47.660\n You go into a room and there's a thing with a button.\n\n1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:50.460\n Yeah, I don't like the great programmer in the sky version.\n\n1:54:50.460 --> 1:54:54.420\n Yeah, but if it's more kind of like,\n\n1:54:54.420 --> 1:54:57.540\n I don't like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata,\n\n1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:03.020\n if it's the cells and the rules,\n\n1:55:03.020 --> 1:55:04.440\n that doesn't feel like God\n\n1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:06.220\n that generates a bunch of stuff.\n\n1:55:06.220 --> 1:55:10.400\n But if there's a machine like that does,\n\n1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:13.680\n that runs the cellular automata and set the rules,\n\n1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:15.020\n then that feels like God.\n\n1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:19.220\n That sort of, in terms of terminology.\n\n1:55:19.220 --> 1:55:21.060\n So I wonder if there's like a machine\n\n1:55:21.060 --> 1:55:23.260\n that's required to generate this universe.\n\n1:55:23.260 --> 1:55:26.820\n That's very sort of important for running this in the lab.\n\n1:55:26.820 --> 1:55:29.420\n So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier,\n\n1:55:29.420 --> 1:55:32.060\n that I can't remember the phrase, but something like,\n\n1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:34.060\n I mean, does God exist in our universe?\n\n1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:35.220\n Yes.\n\n1:55:35.220 --> 1:55:36.980\n Where does God exist?\n\n1:55:36.980 --> 1:55:40.980\n God at least exists in abstraction in our minds,\n\n1:55:40.980 --> 1:55:44.100\n particularly of people who have religious faith\n\n1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:45.140\n they believe in.\n\n1:55:45.140 --> 1:55:47.500\n But let's then take, but you're talking a little bit more\n\n1:55:47.500 --> 1:55:49.140\n about generics, say, well,\n\n1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:51.900\n is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God?\n\n1:55:51.900 --> 1:55:55.920\n I would say God did not exist at the beginning,\n\n1:55:55.920 --> 1:55:58.460\n but he or she does now.\n\n1:55:59.780 --> 1:56:00.620\n Because I'm saying the mechanism.\n\n1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:03.460\n Well, you don't know that he didn't exist in the beginning.\n\n1:56:03.460 --> 1:56:07.900\n So like this could be us in our minds trying to,\n\n1:56:07.900 --> 1:56:10.960\n like just listening to gravitational waves,\n\n1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:12.260\n detecting gravitational waves.\n\n1:56:12.260 --> 1:56:13.100\n It's the same thing.\n\n1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:16.900\n It's us trying to go back further and further\n\n1:56:16.900 --> 1:56:19.900\n into our memories to try to understand the machines\n\n1:56:19.900 --> 1:56:23.260\n that make up, that make up us.\n\n1:56:23.260 --> 1:56:27.100\n And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp\n\n1:56:27.100 --> 1:56:32.100\n at possible kind of what kind of machines could create.\n\n1:56:32.100 --> 1:56:33.980\n There's always a tweet.\n\n1:56:33.980 --> 1:56:36.540\n There's always a tweet.\n\n1:56:36.540 --> 1:56:39.180\n If the universe is a computer, then God must have built it\n\n1:56:39.180 --> 1:56:41.140\n because computers need creators.\n\n1:56:41.140 --> 1:56:42.040\n There you go.\n\n1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:46.380\n And then Joshe Bach replied,\n\n1:56:46.380 --> 1:56:48.620\n since there's something rather than nothing,\n\n1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:50.820\n perhaps existence is the default.\n\n1:56:52.340 --> 1:56:56.340\n If existence is the default, then many computers exist.\n\n1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:59.020\n Creator gods are necessary computers,\n\n1:56:59.020 --> 1:57:00.740\n unnecessarily computers too.\n\n1:57:00.740 --> 1:57:03.180\n I'm very confused by that, but that's an interesting idea\n\n1:57:03.180 --> 1:57:05.780\n that existence is the default versus nonexistence.\n\n1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:07.620\n I agree with that, but the rest is not.\n\n1:57:07.620 --> 1:57:08.620\n And then Lee responds,\n\n1:57:08.620 --> 1:57:11.820\n perhaps this reasoning is incomplete.\n\n1:57:11.820 --> 1:57:14.580\n That's how scientists talk trash each other\n\n1:57:14.580 --> 1:57:16.060\n on Twitter apparently.\n\n1:57:16.060 --> 1:57:18.700\n Which part don't you agree with?\n\n1:57:18.700 --> 1:57:20.620\n When he said if existence is default,\n\n1:57:20.620 --> 1:57:22.100\n then many computers exist,\n\n1:57:22.100 --> 1:57:25.200\n this comes back to the inventor and discovery argument.\n\n1:57:26.300 --> 1:57:29.740\n I would say the universe at the beginning wasn't capable\n\n1:57:29.740 --> 1:57:33.340\n of computation because there wasn't enough technology,\n\n1:57:33.340 --> 1:57:34.820\n enough states.\n\n1:57:34.820 --> 1:57:38.520\n So what you're saying is if God is a mechanism,\n\n1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.620\n so I might actually agree,\n\n1:57:40.620 --> 1:57:43.500\n but then the thing is lots of people see God\n\n1:57:43.500 --> 1:57:44.540\n as more than a mechanism.\n\n1:57:44.540 --> 1:57:47.760\n For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory\n\n1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:50.020\n that creates all the stuff that the memories we know.\n\n1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:52.740\n And the fact that we can even relate to each other\n\n1:57:52.740 --> 1:57:54.840\n is because we have the same, we share that heritage.\n\n1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:56.820\n And why we love each other\n\n1:57:56.820 --> 1:57:58.700\n or we like to see God in each other\n\n1:57:58.700 --> 1:58:03.700\n is it's just we know we have a shared existence.\n\n1:58:04.740 --> 1:58:06.540\n So if the God is the mechanism\n\n1:58:06.540 --> 1:58:08.500\n that created this whole thing,\n\n1:58:08.500 --> 1:58:12.140\n I think a lot of people see God in a religious sense\n\n1:58:12.140 --> 1:58:15.980\n as that mechanism also being able to communicate\n\n1:58:15.980 --> 1:58:18.020\n with the objects it creates.\n\n1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:19.620\n And if it's just the mechanism,\n\n1:58:19.620 --> 1:58:23.540\n we won't be able to communicate with the objects it creates.\n\n1:58:23.540 --> 1:58:24.580\n It can only create.\n\n1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:29.060\n You can't interact with the...\n\n1:58:29.060 --> 1:58:30.780\n Well, there's versions of God that create the universe\n\n1:58:30.780 --> 1:58:31.620\n and then left.\n\n1:58:33.620 --> 1:58:35.340\n Yeah, like spark.\n\n1:58:35.340 --> 1:58:36.180\n For some religions.\n\n1:58:36.180 --> 1:58:37.820\n The first spark, yeah.\n\n1:58:37.820 --> 1:58:40.060\n But I think I liked your analogy\n\n1:58:40.060 --> 1:58:42.300\n of the machine and the rules, right?\n\n1:58:42.300 --> 1:58:47.300\n But I think part of the problem is,\n\n1:58:47.420 --> 1:58:48.620\n I mean, we have this conception\n\n1:58:48.620 --> 1:58:50.500\n that we can disentangle the rules\n\n1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:51.860\n from the physical substrate, right?\n\n1:58:51.860 --> 1:58:53.920\n And that's the whole thing about software and hardware\n\n1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:56.140\n being separate or the way Newton wrote his laws\n\n1:58:56.140 --> 1:58:57.220\n that there was some,\n\n1:58:57.220 --> 1:58:58.620\n like they exist outside the universe.\n\n1:58:58.620 --> 1:59:00.060\n They're not actually a feature of the universe.\n\n1:59:00.060 --> 1:59:03.100\n They don't have to emerge out of the universe itself.\n\n1:59:03.100 --> 1:59:06.500\n So I think if you merge your two views,\n\n1:59:06.500 --> 1:59:08.620\n then it gets back to the God is the universe.\n\n1:59:08.620 --> 1:59:10.220\n And then I think the deeper question\n\n1:59:10.220 --> 1:59:12.900\n is why does it seem like there's meaning and purpose?\n\n1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:16.320\n And if I think about the features of the universe\n\n1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:17.880\n that give it the most meaning and purpose,\n\n1:59:17.880 --> 1:59:19.380\n those are what we would call\n\n1:59:19.380 --> 1:59:21.100\n the living components of the universe.\n\n1:59:21.100 --> 1:59:24.180\n So if you wanted to say God is a physically real thing,\n\n1:59:24.180 --> 1:59:25.220\n which you were saying\n\n1:59:25.220 --> 1:59:26.740\n is like an emergent property of our minds,\n\n1:59:26.740 --> 1:59:30.020\n but I would just say the way the universe\n\n1:59:30.020 --> 1:59:31.420\n creates meaning and purpose,\n\n1:59:31.420 --> 1:59:32.860\n there is really a physics there.\n\n1:59:32.860 --> 1:59:35.020\n It's not like a illusory thing.\n\n1:59:35.020 --> 1:59:37.460\n And that is just what the physics of life is.\n\n1:59:39.140 --> 1:59:41.780\n Is it possible that we've forgotten\n\n1:59:41.780 --> 1:59:44.540\n much of the mechanisms that created the universe?\n\n1:59:45.660 --> 1:59:48.580\n So like, so basically, you know,\n\n1:59:48.580 --> 1:59:50.740\n whatever, if God is that mechanism,\n\n1:59:50.740 --> 1:59:52.340\n we just leave parts of that behind.\n\n1:59:52.340 --> 1:59:54.700\n Well, but the universe is constantly generating itself.\n\n1:59:54.700 --> 1:59:56.000\n So if God is that mechanism,\n\n1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.340\n it would be that that would still be active today.\n\n1:59:58.340 --> 2:00:00.260\n I don't, like, I'm agnostic,\n\n2:00:00.260 --> 2:00:05.100\n but if I recall the things I believe in God\n\n2:00:05.100 --> 2:00:07.620\n in the way that some people talk about God,\n\n2:00:07.620 --> 2:00:09.940\n I would say that God is, you know,\n\n2:00:09.940 --> 2:00:13.660\n like in the universe now, it's not an absent thing.\n\n2:00:16.260 --> 2:00:18.020\n So I think there's a mislabeling here\n\n2:00:18.020 --> 2:00:23.020\n because you're, I mean, I mean, I'm a professional idiot,\n\n2:00:25.060 --> 2:00:27.660\n actually, but, but, um.\n\n2:00:27.660 --> 2:00:29.220\n You should put that on your CV.\n\n2:00:29.220 --> 2:00:30.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:00:30.060 --> 2:00:33.820\n Professionally, not recreationally or amateur,\n\n2:00:33.820 --> 2:00:36.300\n but professionally, you're paid for it.\n\n2:00:36.300 --> 2:00:38.300\n I would say if you were talking about God,\n\n2:00:38.300 --> 2:00:40.260\n I mean, again, I'm way out, way out of my depth here,\n\n2:00:40.260 --> 2:00:41.620\n and I almost feel uncomfortable.\n\n2:00:41.620 --> 2:00:43.820\n Yeah, but I feel quite uncomfortable articulating,\n\n2:00:43.820 --> 2:00:45.020\n but I'll try.\n\n2:00:45.020 --> 2:00:47.700\n For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness\n\n2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:52.540\n and a reasoning entity that actually has causal power,\n\n2:00:52.540 --> 2:00:56.220\n and you're, and so you're, it's like,\n\n2:00:56.220 --> 2:00:57.860\n then you're saying like gravity could be God\n\n2:00:57.860 --> 2:00:58.820\n or time could be God.\n\n2:00:58.820 --> 2:01:02.820\n I mean, I think for me, for my conception of time\n\n2:01:02.820 --> 2:01:04.620\n is probably as fundamental as God\n\n2:01:04.620 --> 2:01:07.700\n because it gave rise to human intelligence and consciousness\n\n2:01:07.700 --> 2:01:10.500\n in which we can have this abstract notion of God.\n\n2:01:12.060 --> 2:01:15.420\n So I think that you're maybe talking about God\n\n2:01:15.420 --> 2:01:19.580\n in a very mechanistic, kind of unsophisticated sense,\n\n2:01:19.580 --> 2:01:21.740\n whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated\n\n2:01:21.740 --> 2:01:23.620\n and got all this, you know, feelings and love\n\n2:01:23.620 --> 2:01:27.060\n and, you know, and this abstracting ability.\n\n2:01:27.060 --> 2:01:29.660\n So is that what, or do you mean that?\n\n2:01:29.660 --> 2:01:32.420\n Do you mean God as in this conscious entity\n\n2:01:32.420 --> 2:01:35.200\n that decided to flick the universe into existence?\n\n2:01:36.100 --> 2:01:40.540\n Well, one of the features that God would have\n\n2:01:40.540 --> 2:01:45.540\n is the ability to flick the universe into existence.\n\n2:01:46.740 --> 2:01:49.180\n I, you know, like Windows 95,\n\n2:01:49.180 --> 2:01:52.140\n I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP\n\n2:01:52.140 --> 2:01:55.620\n or Windows 10, I don't know the full feature set.\n\n2:01:55.620 --> 2:01:58.580\n So at the very least, you have to flick the universe\n\n2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:03.220\n into existence, and then other features might include\n\n2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:07.640\n ability to interact with that universe in interesting ways,\n\n2:02:07.640 --> 2:02:11.020\n and then how do you interact with the universe\n\n2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:11.860\n in interesting ways?\n\n2:02:11.860 --> 2:02:13.300\n You have to be able to speak the language\n\n2:02:13.300 --> 2:02:15.140\n of its different components.\n\n2:02:15.140 --> 2:02:17.620\n So in order to interact with humans,\n\n2:02:17.620 --> 2:02:22.220\n you have to know how to act humanlike.\n\n2:02:24.260 --> 2:02:29.260\n So I don't know, but it seems like\n\n2:02:31.420 --> 2:02:33.660\n whatever mechanism created the universe\n\n2:02:33.660 --> 2:02:38.660\n might want to also generate local pockets of mechanisms\n\n2:02:40.780 --> 2:02:42.500\n that can interact with that.\n\n2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:44.380\n Like inject.\n\n2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:46.660\n Like God was lonely?\n\n2:02:46.660 --> 2:02:49.180\n Yeah, I mean, it could be just a teenager\n\n2:02:49.180 --> 2:02:51.740\n and another just playing a video game.\n\n2:02:51.740 --> 2:02:52.580\n Yeah, maybe.\n\n2:02:52.580 --> 2:02:54.460\n Well, I was gonna say, I mean, I don't,\n\n2:02:54.460 --> 2:02:57.700\n so this is referring to our origin of life engine.\n\n2:02:57.700 --> 2:02:59.160\n It's like, I don't believe in God,\n\n2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:01.580\n but that doesn't mean I don't wanna be one.\n\n2:03:01.580 --> 2:03:02.420\n Right.\n\n2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:04.420\n I don't wanna make a universe and make a life form,\n\n2:03:04.420 --> 2:03:07.420\n but that may be rude to people who have\n\n2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:08.580\n dear religious beliefs.\n\n2:03:08.580 --> 2:03:13.500\n What I mean by that is if we are able to create\n\n2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:16.460\n an entirely new life form, different chemistry,\n\n2:03:16.460 --> 2:03:20.980\n different culture, what does it make us?\n\n2:03:20.980 --> 2:03:23.260\n By that definition, it makes us gods, right?\n\n2:03:23.260 --> 2:03:24.100\n Well, there is.\n\n2:03:24.100 --> 2:03:24.940\n I mean, like when you have children,\n\n2:03:24.940 --> 2:03:28.140\n you're like one of the magical things of that\n\n2:03:28.140 --> 2:03:29.620\n is you're kind of mini gods.\n\n2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:32.940\n I mean, first of all, from a child's perspective,\n\n2:03:32.940 --> 2:03:34.900\n parents are gods for quite a while.\n\n2:03:34.900 --> 2:03:38.720\n And then, I mean, in the positive sense,\n\n2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:39.560\n there's a magic to that.\n\n2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:41.220\n That's why I love robotics,\n\n2:03:41.220 --> 2:03:43.380\n is you instill life into something,\n\n2:03:43.380 --> 2:03:48.380\n and that makes you feel godlike in a sort of positive way.\n\n2:03:50.340 --> 2:03:51.620\n Being a creator is a positive feeling.\n\n2:03:51.620 --> 2:03:54.280\n Creator, yeah, exactly, on a small scale.\n\n2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:57.060\n And then God would be a creator\n\n2:03:57.060 --> 2:03:59.700\n at the largest possible scale, I suppose.\n\n2:03:59.700 --> 2:04:03.900\n Okay, you mentioned offline the Assembletron.\n\n2:04:05.260 --> 2:04:06.100\n Assembletron.\n\n2:04:06.100 --> 2:04:07.140\n Assembletron.\n\n2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:08.220\n Yep.\n\n2:04:08.220 --> 2:04:09.460\n What's an Assembletron?\n\n2:04:09.460 --> 2:04:12.900\n This is an early idea of something you're thinking about.\n\n2:04:12.900 --> 2:04:15.580\n So Sarah's team, well, I think Sarah's team\n\n2:04:15.580 --> 2:04:19.420\n are interested in using AI to understand life.\n\n2:04:19.420 --> 2:04:23.560\n My team is, and I'm wondering if we could apply\n\n2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:25.420\n the principles of assembly theory,\n\n2:04:25.420 --> 2:04:28.420\n that is the causal structure that you get\n\n2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:30.940\n with assembly theory, and hybridize it,\n\n2:04:30.940 --> 2:04:34.740\n and make a new type of neuron, if you like.\n\n2:04:34.740 --> 2:04:37.940\n I mean, there are causal neural networks out there,\n\n2:04:37.940 --> 2:04:40.580\n but they are not quite the architecture\n\n2:04:40.580 --> 2:04:41.940\n of what I would like.\n\n2:04:41.940 --> 2:04:45.820\n I would like to associate memory bits with,\n\n2:04:45.820 --> 2:04:47.580\n basically, I'd like to make a,\n\n2:04:47.580 --> 2:04:50.380\n rather than having an ASIC for neural networks,\n\n2:04:50.380 --> 2:04:54.720\n I wanna make an ASIC for assembly networks, right?\n\n2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:56.100\n And.\n\n2:04:56.100 --> 2:04:57.100\n So can you say that again?\n\n2:04:57.100 --> 2:04:58.960\n Assembly networks.\n\n2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:05.460\n So what is a thing with an input and an output,\n\n2:05:05.460 --> 2:05:07.500\n and it's like a neural network type of thing,\n\n2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:08.340\n what does it do exactly?\n\n2:05:08.340 --> 2:05:09.720\n What's the input, what's the output?\n\n2:05:09.720 --> 2:05:11.980\n So in this case, so if you're talking about\n\n2:05:11.980 --> 2:05:13.540\n a general neural network, I mean,\n\n2:05:13.540 --> 2:05:15.700\n in general neural network, you can train it\n\n2:05:15.700 --> 2:05:20.260\n on any sort of data, right, depending on the framework,\n\n2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:25.260\n whether it's like text, or image data, or whatnot.\n\n2:05:25.940 --> 2:05:30.100\n And that's fine, but there's no causal structure\n\n2:05:30.100 --> 2:05:31.340\n associated with that data.\n\n2:05:31.340 --> 2:05:33.880\n Now just imagine, rather than, you know,\n\n2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:35.100\n let's say we're gonna classify a difference\n\n2:05:35.100 --> 2:05:36.100\n between cat and dog, right?\n\n2:05:36.100 --> 2:05:38.040\n Classic cat and dog neural network.\n\n2:05:38.040 --> 2:05:42.340\n What about if the system understood the assembly space,\n\n2:05:42.340 --> 2:05:43.940\n it created the cat and the dog,\n\n2:05:44.980 --> 2:05:47.920\n and rather than guessing what was happening,\n\n2:05:47.920 --> 2:05:49.420\n and training on those images,\n\n2:05:49.420 --> 2:05:51.220\n and not understanding those features,\n\n2:05:53.860 --> 2:05:56.620\n you almost like, you could imagine doing a,\n\n2:05:56.620 --> 2:05:59.300\n going back a step and doing, and training,\n\n2:05:59.300 --> 2:06:01.020\n going back a step and doing the training,\n\n2:06:01.020 --> 2:06:02.860\n going back a step, back a step, back a step,\n\n2:06:02.860 --> 2:06:06.620\n and I wonder if that is actually the origin of intelligence,\n\n2:06:06.620 --> 2:06:08.900\n or how we'll crack intelligence.\n\n2:06:08.900 --> 2:06:11.820\n Because we need to, because we'll create\n\n2:06:11.820 --> 2:06:16.820\n the entire graph of events, and be able to kind of\n\n2:06:17.340 --> 2:06:19.140\n look at cause and effect across those graphs.\n\n2:06:19.140 --> 2:06:20.420\n I'm explaining it really badly,\n\n2:06:20.420 --> 2:06:23.700\n but it's a gene of an idea, and I'm guessing\n\n2:06:23.700 --> 2:06:28.700\n very smart, very rich people in AI are already doing this.\n\n2:06:28.860 --> 2:06:31.480\n Trying to not generate cats and dogs,\n\n2:06:31.480 --> 2:06:35.060\n but trying to generate things of high assembly index.\n\n2:06:35.060 --> 2:06:39.340\n Yeah, and I think, and also using causal graphs\n\n2:06:39.340 --> 2:06:42.820\n in neural networks, and machine learning, and deep learning,\n\n2:06:42.820 --> 2:06:44.300\n maybe building a new architecture.\n\n2:06:44.300 --> 2:06:45.960\n I'm just wondering, is there something\n\n2:06:45.960 --> 2:06:47.100\n we can get out of assembly theory\n\n2:06:47.100 --> 2:06:49.940\n that allows us to rebuild current machine learning\n\n2:06:49.940 --> 2:06:54.940\n architectures to give causation more cheaply?\n\n2:06:54.940 --> 2:06:56.540\n I mean, I don't know if that's what you,\n\n2:06:56.540 --> 2:06:58.240\n we've been inventing this for a little while,\n\n2:06:58.240 --> 2:07:00.500\n but we're trying to finish the theory paper first\n\n2:07:00.500 --> 2:07:01.580\n before we do anything else.\n\n2:07:01.580 --> 2:07:05.420\n Yeah, you also wanna have, say, goal directed behavior\n\n2:07:05.420 --> 2:07:07.340\n in neural networks, then assembly theory\n\n2:07:07.340 --> 2:07:08.580\n is a good framework for doing that.\n\n2:07:08.580 --> 2:07:10.500\n Daniel's been thinking about that a lot.\n\n2:07:10.500 --> 2:07:12.300\n And I think it's a really interesting idea\n\n2:07:12.300 --> 2:07:16.180\n that you can map concepts from how neural networks learn\n\n2:07:16.180 --> 2:07:18.780\n to thinking about goal directed behavior\n\n2:07:18.780 --> 2:07:20.020\n as a learning process.\n\n2:07:20.020 --> 2:07:21.300\n That you're learning a specific goal.\n\n2:07:21.300 --> 2:07:22.580\n The universe is learning a goal\n\n2:07:22.580 --> 2:07:24.180\n when it generates a particular structure,\n\n2:07:24.180 --> 2:07:25.980\n and that you can map that physical structure\n\n2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:27.100\n in a neural network.\n\n2:07:29.100 --> 2:07:30.080\n What's the goal?\n\n2:07:31.780 --> 2:07:34.180\n Well, in a neural network, you're designing the goal.\n\n2:07:34.180 --> 2:07:39.180\n In biology, I mean, people are not supposed to use\n\n2:07:39.420 --> 2:07:41.780\n teleological language in biology, which is ridiculous,\n\n2:07:41.780 --> 2:07:45.140\n but, because goals are real things.\n\n2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:47.300\n They're just post selected.\n\n2:07:47.300 --> 2:07:49.520\n So you can talk about goals after the fact.\n\n2:07:51.060 --> 2:07:52.740\n Once a goal emerges in the universe,\n\n2:07:52.740 --> 2:07:54.740\n that physical entity has a goal.\n\n2:07:54.740 --> 2:07:57.600\n But Lee and I came up with a test for,\n\n2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:00.380\n like a Turing test for goal directed behavior\n\n2:08:00.380 --> 2:08:01.940\n based on the idea of assembly.\n\n2:08:01.940 --> 2:08:03.000\n We have to formalize it still,\n\n2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:04.540\n but I would like to write a paper on it.\n\n2:08:04.540 --> 2:08:09.140\n But the basic idea is if you had two systems\n\n2:08:09.140 --> 2:08:11.080\n that were completely equivalent,\n\n2:08:11.080 --> 2:08:14.400\n you know, like in the instantaneous,\n\n2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:16.080\n like physical experimental setup.\n\n2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:18.280\n So Lee has to figure out how to do this.\n\n2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:19.980\n But there was something that would be different\n\n2:08:19.980 --> 2:08:21.720\n in their future.\n\n2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:23.520\n And there was a symmetry breaking you observe\n\n2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:25.320\n in the present based on that possibility\n\n2:08:25.320 --> 2:08:26.560\n of that future outcome.\n\n2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:28.240\n Then you could say that that system\n\n2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:31.000\n had some representation of some kind of goal in mind\n\n2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:33.080\n about what it wanted to do in the future.\n\n2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:35.820\n And I, so goals are interesting\n\n2:08:35.820 --> 2:08:38.840\n because they don't exist as instantaneous things.\n\n2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:40.040\n They exist across time,\n\n2:08:40.040 --> 2:08:42.720\n which is one of the reasons that assembly theories\n\n2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:45.880\n may be more naturally able to account\n\n2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:47.340\n for the existence of goals.\n\n2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:52.280\n So goals are, they only exist in time,\n\n2:08:52.280 --> 2:08:55.160\n or they manifest themselves in time\n\n2:08:55.160 --> 2:08:58.660\n through, you said, symmetry breaking.\n\n2:08:58.660 --> 2:09:01.840\n So it's almost like, imagine,\n\n2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:05.560\n like if representations in your mind are real, right?\n\n2:09:05.560 --> 2:09:08.120\n And you can imagine future possibilities,\n\n2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:11.080\n but imagine everything else is physically equivalent.\n\n2:09:11.080 --> 2:09:13.160\n And the only thing that you actually change\n\n2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:15.480\n your decision based on is what you model\n\n2:09:15.480 --> 2:09:17.200\n as being the future outcome.\n\n2:09:17.200 --> 2:09:20.200\n Then somehow that representation in your mind\n\n2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:21.680\n of the future outcome becomes causal\n\n2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:22.520\n to what you're doing now.\n\n2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:24.520\n So there's kind of like retro causal effect,\n\n2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:25.960\n but it's not actually retro causal.\n\n2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:28.560\n It's just that your assembly space\n\n2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:31.680\n is actually includes those possibilities\n\n2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:32.640\n as part of the structure.\n\n2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:34.160\n It's just, you're not observing all the features\n\n2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:36.080\n of the assembly space in the current moment.\n\n2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:40.560\n Or the possibilities exist, but they don't become a goal\n\n2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:42.120\n until they're realized.\n\n2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:44.140\n So one of the features of assembly space\n\n2:09:44.140 --> 2:09:45.560\n that's super interesting,\n\n2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:48.960\n and it's easier to envision with like Legos, for example,\n\n2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:50.800\n is if you're thinking about an assembly space,\n\n2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:52.880\n you can't observe the entire assembly space\n\n2:09:52.880 --> 2:09:54.020\n in any instant in time.\n\n2:09:54.020 --> 2:09:55.800\n So if you imagine a stack of Legos,\n\n2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:58.740\n and you wanna look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos,\n\n2:09:58.740 --> 2:10:00.600\n you have to break the Legos apart,\n\n2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:03.200\n and then you look at all the possible ways\n\n2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:05.560\n of building up the original object.\n\n2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:06.880\n So now you have in your mind\n\n2:10:06.880 --> 2:10:08.480\n the goal of building that object,\n\n2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:10.720\n and you have all the possible ways of doing it.\n\n2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:13.120\n And those are actual physical features of that object,\n\n2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:14.800\n but that object doesn't always exist.\n\n2:10:14.800 --> 2:10:17.600\n What exists is the possibility of generating it.\n\n2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:20.460\n And the possibilities are always infinite.\n\n2:10:20.460 --> 2:10:22.760\n Well, for that particular object,\n\n2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:25.280\n like it has a well defined assembly space.\n\n2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:27.220\n And I guess what I'm saying is that object\n\n2:10:27.220 --> 2:10:28.840\n is the assembly space,\n\n2:10:28.840 --> 2:10:31.760\n but you actually have to unpack that object across time\n\n2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:33.280\n to view that feature of it.\n\n2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:35.160\n It's only an observable across time.\n\n2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:39.360\n The term goal is such a important\n\n2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:41.960\n and difficult to explain concept, right?\n\n2:10:41.960 --> 2:10:44.580\n Because what you want is a way is like,\n\n2:10:44.580 --> 2:10:47.820\n I think only conscious beings can have conscious goals.\n\n2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:51.600\n Everything else is doing selection.\n\n2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:53.560\n And but selection does invent goals.\n\n2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:58.560\n And in a way that the way that biology reinterprets the past\n\n2:10:58.560 --> 2:11:03.520\n in the present is kind of helped you to understand\n\n2:11:03.520 --> 2:11:05.400\n there was a goal in the past now, right?\n\n2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:08.260\n It's kind of like goals only exist back in time.\n\n2:11:09.280 --> 2:11:14.280\n So first of all, only conscious beings\n\n2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:17.280\n can have conscious goals.\n\n2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:19.200\n I'm not even gonna touch that one.\n\n2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:20.040\n Why?\n\n2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:23.320\n Go for it, come on.\n\n2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:25.200\n The line between conscious goals\n\n2:11:25.200 --> 2:11:28.880\n and non conscious goals, exactly.\n\n2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:31.080\n And also maybe just on top of that,\n\n2:11:31.080 --> 2:11:33.960\n you said a Turing test for goal directed behavior.\n\n2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:38.960\n What does a Turing test potentially look like?\n\n2:11:39.100 --> 2:11:40.920\n So if you've got two objects, we were thinking about this.\n\n2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:42.800\n So we actually got some funding\n\n2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:43.840\n to work to go on two teams.\n\n2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:46.200\n So I'm trying to do, and part of this\n\n2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:47.720\n is I'm trying to do a bit of theory\n\n2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:49.560\n and Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory\n\n2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:51.520\n and Sarah is trying to design experiments\n\n2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:52.360\n and I'm teaching experiments.\n\n2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:53.760\n Cause I think it's really good for us to have that.\n\n2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:58.540\n So say, when would a, so that's good.\n\n2:11:58.540 --> 2:12:02.040\n I like this, I'm sure we're using Dan Dennett essay.\n\n2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:04.040\n Yeah, and I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it\n\n2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:05.840\n a Turing test after, but Dan Dennett.\n\n2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:07.840\n So Dan Dennett wrote this really nice essay\n\n2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:11.840\n about herding cats and freewill inflation.\n\n2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:14.040\n The title is so brilliant.\n\n2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:14.880\n That's the actual title?\n\n2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:15.700\n That's the title, yeah.\n\n2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:18.120\n Herding cats and freewill inflation.\n\n2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:19.040\n Yeah, something like that.\n\n2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:20.320\n I mean, it's not, maybe not.\n\n2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:21.160\n And so.\n\n2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:22.000\n No, I think that's right.\n\n2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:23.880\n So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects\n\n2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:26.040\n on a hillside, okay?\n\n2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:28.160\n And it just happens to be a snowy hill\n\n2:12:28.160 --> 2:12:29.640\n and let's just say you see an object\n\n2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:31.480\n get rolling down the hill.\n\n2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:34.680\n Or you, and the rock rolls down the hill\n\n2:12:34.680 --> 2:12:36.720\n but the start goes to the end.\n\n2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:38.000\n How do you know that object's had a goal?\n\n2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:39.560\n Now you unveil the object\n\n2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:41.780\n and you'll see it's actually a skier.\n\n2:12:41.780 --> 2:12:44.320\n And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom.\n\n2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:45.640\n Great.\n\n2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:46.700\n Then you look at the rock.\n\n2:12:46.700 --> 2:12:48.680\n Rock rolls down the hill and goes to the bottom.\n\n2:12:48.680 --> 2:12:51.240\n How can you tell the difference between the two?\n\n2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:54.200\n So, and what Dan says is like, well, this is clear.\n\n2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:56.340\n The skier's in control.\n\n2:12:56.340 --> 2:12:58.840\n And because they're adjusting the trajectory,\n\n2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:00.600\n so there's some updating going on.\n\n2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:01.800\n Then the only way you could really do that\n\n2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:04.240\n is if you put the skier back to the top of the hill again,\n\n2:13:04.240 --> 2:13:06.140\n they would tend to start roughly in the same space\n\n2:13:06.140 --> 2:13:09.760\n and probably take all that complex set of trajectories\n\n2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:12.000\n and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right?\n\n2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:13.420\n With plus or minus a few meters.\n\n2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:15.400\n Whereas if it was just a random rock\n\n2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:18.000\n going down to a random trajectory, that wouldn't happen.\n\n2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.320\n And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing\n\n2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:21.560\n when we were writing this grant,\n\n2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:25.560\n we were like, we need to somehow instantiate the skier\n\n2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:27.760\n and the rock in an experiment.\n\n2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:31.040\n And then say, okay, when does the object,\n\n2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:34.320\n so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update.\n\n2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:36.560\n It has to have some sensing and some kind of,\n\n2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:41.440\n you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to the environment.\n\n2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:44.120\n And then we just have to iterate on that.\n\n2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:47.120\n And maybe Sarah, you can then fill in the Turing test part.\n\n2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:49.080\n Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me\n\n2:13:49.080 --> 2:13:50.000\n was slightly different.\n\n2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.220\n So I get really frustrated about conversations\n\n2:13:52.220 --> 2:13:54.580\n about consciousness as most people do.\n\n2:13:54.580 --> 2:13:56.080\n You know, a lot of people are,\n\n2:13:56.080 --> 2:13:59.080\n which is not necessarily related to free will directly\n\n2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:01.040\n or to this goal directed behavior.\n\n2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:03.080\n But I think there's a whole set of bundled\n\n2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:04.680\n and related topics here.\n\n2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:07.000\n But I think for me, I was, you know,\n\n2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.360\n everybody's always interested in explaining\n\n2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:12.220\n intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic experience.\n\n2:14:12.220 --> 2:14:14.800\n And there's all sorts of problems with that\n\n2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:17.320\n because you can never actually be another physical system.\n\n2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:18.200\n So you can't know what it's like\n\n2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:20.400\n to be another physical system.\n\n2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:21.760\n So I always thought there must be some way\n\n2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:23.620\n of getting at this problem about\n\n2:14:23.620 --> 2:14:26.200\n if an agent or an entity is conscious\n\n2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:28.840\n or at least has internal representations\n\n2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:30.920\n and those are real physical things,\n\n2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:34.600\n that it must have causal consequences.\n\n2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:38.200\n So the way I would ask the question of consciousness\n\n2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:40.820\n is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically?\n\n2:14:40.820 --> 2:14:43.680\n But if things have intrinsic experience,\n\n2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:45.700\n is there any observable difference from the outside\n\n2:14:45.700 --> 2:14:47.800\n about the kind of causation\n\n2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:50.200\n that that physical system would enact in?\n\n2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:52.800\n And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do\n\n2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:53.840\n is have imagination.\n\n2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:56.200\n So like we can imagine rockets centuries\n\n2:14:56.200 --> 2:14:57.360\n before we build them.\n\n2:14:57.360 --> 2:14:59.040\n They've become real physical things\n\n2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:00.680\n because we imagine them.\n\n2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:02.880\n And people might disentangle that from conscious experience,\n\n2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:04.780\n but I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do\n\n2:15:04.780 --> 2:15:06.960\n is actually a conscious process.\n\n2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:09.820\n So then this becomes a question of\n\n2:15:09.820 --> 2:15:12.280\n if I were observing systems and I said,\n\n2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:15.200\n one had an internal representation,\n\n2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:16.220\n which is slightly different\n\n2:15:16.220 --> 2:15:17.780\n than a conscious experience, obviously.\n\n2:15:17.780 --> 2:15:19.240\n So I'm entangling some concepts,\n\n2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:22.260\n but it's a loose set of thought experiments.\n\n2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:24.840\n Then how, and I set them up\n\n2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:27.480\n in a physically equivalent situation.\n\n2:15:28.380 --> 2:15:30.240\n Would it be the case that\n\n2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:34.800\n there would be experimental observables associated with it?\n\n2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:38.280\n And that became the idea of trying to actually\n\n2:15:38.280 --> 2:15:40.120\n measure for internal representation and conscious.\n\n2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:42.400\n So Turing basically didn't wanna do that.\n\n2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:44.520\n You just wanted the machine that could emulate\n\n2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:46.000\n and trick you into having the behavior,\n\n2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.580\n but never dealt with the internal experience\n\n2:15:48.580 --> 2:15:51.040\n because he didn't know how to do that.\n\n2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:53.080\n And I guess I was wondering,\n\n2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:55.240\n is there a way to set up the experiment\n\n2:15:55.240 --> 2:15:57.600\n where you could actually test for that?\n\n2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:00.840\n For imagination that led to the thing.\n\n2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:02.760\n That there was something internal going on,\n\n2:16:02.760 --> 2:16:06.360\n some kind of inner world, as people say,\n\n2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:09.920\n or you could say, it actually is an agent,\n\n2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:13.800\n it's making decisions, it has an internal representation.\n\n2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:15.660\n And whether you say that's experience or not\n\n2:16:15.660 --> 2:16:18.160\n is a different thing, but at least the feature\n\n2:16:18.160 --> 2:16:20.400\n that there's some abstraction it's doing\n\n2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:23.240\n that's not obvious from looking at the physical substrates.\n\n2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:25.200\n Do you think it's possible to do that kind of thing?\n\n2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:27.980\n One of the compelling things about the Turing test\n\n2:16:27.980 --> 2:16:30.360\n is that defining intelligence,\n\n2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:32.640\n defining any complicated concept\n\n2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:37.640\n as a thing like observing it from the surface\n\n2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:40.480\n and not caring about what's going on deep inside\n\n2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:42.640\n because how do you know?\n\n2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:43.680\n That's the point.\n\n2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:45.000\n So the idea is exactly that.\n\n2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:46.440\n So what we're trying to do,\n\n2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:47.800\n the Turing test for goal directedness\n\n2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:50.520\n is literally take some objects\n\n2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:52.360\n that clearly don't have any internal representation,\n\n2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:54.920\n grains of sand blowing on the beach or something,\n\n2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:59.400\n and I don't know, a crab wandering around on the beach\n\n2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:00.760\n and then generating an experiment\n\n2:17:00.760 --> 2:17:04.320\n where literally the experiment generates an entity\n\n2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:07.800\n that literally has no internal representation to sand,\n\n2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:08.940\n these are oil droplets actually,\n\n2:17:08.940 --> 2:17:11.640\n what we've got in mind, a robot that makes oil droplets.\n\n2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:13.280\n But then what we wanna try and do\n\n2:17:13.280 --> 2:17:16.120\n is train the oil droplets to be like crabs,\n\n2:17:16.120 --> 2:17:18.120\n give them an internal representation,\n\n2:17:18.120 --> 2:17:21.640\n give them the ability to integrate information\n\n2:17:21.640 --> 2:17:25.260\n from the environment so they remember the past,\n\n2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:31.080\n are in the present, and can imagine a future.\n\n2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:33.600\n And in a very limited way, their kind of game engine,\n\n2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:36.280\n their limited simulation of the world\n\n2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:38.320\n allows them to then make a decision.\n\n2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:40.320\n They're objects across time.\n\n2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:43.040\n So then you would run a bunch of crabs\n\n2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:44.600\n like over and over and over and over?\n\n2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:45.960\n How many crabs, Lee?\n\n2:17:45.960 --> 2:17:47.480\n How many, is there, what's,\n\n2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:49.320\n because you have to have a large number of crabs,\n\n2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:52.560\n what does your theory say, is there a mathematical?\n\n2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:54.160\n We're working on it, I mean, this is literally.\n\n2:17:54.160 --> 2:17:55.800\n Limit, crab limit.\n\n2:17:55.800 --> 2:17:57.040\n There's literally a.\n\n2:17:57.040 --> 2:17:57.880\n Excellent.\n\n2:17:57.880 --> 2:17:58.720\n There's literally a.\n\n2:17:58.720 --> 2:17:59.960\n What's the herding cats have to do?\n\n2:17:59.960 --> 2:18:02.480\n Oh, that's random, wait, what's cats,\n\n2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:04.520\n in the title by Daniel Dennett,\n\n2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:06.720\n Herding Cats and the Free Will Inflation.\n\n2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:07.680\n So, I love this.\n\n2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:08.920\n What does herding cats mean,\n\n2:18:08.920 --> 2:18:10.800\n what does free will inflation mean?\n\n2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:13.080\n So this, I love this essay,\n\n2:18:13.080 --> 2:18:14.440\n because it explained to me\n\n2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:17.080\n how I can live in a deterministic universe,\n\n2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:22.480\n but have, not free will, but have freedom.\n\n2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:26.640\n And also it helped me explain\n\n2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:30.920\n that time needed to be a real thing in this universe.\n\n2:18:30.920 --> 2:18:33.840\n So what basically Dan was saying here is like,\n\n2:18:33.840 --> 2:18:35.800\n how do you, how do these cats appear\n\n2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:38.440\n to just do what they want, right?\n\n2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:41.240\n And if you live in a deterministic universe,\n\n2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:43.280\n why do the cats do these things?\n\n2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:46.280\n You know, aren't they just, isn't it all obvious?\n\n2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:48.720\n And how does free will inflate the universe?\n\n2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:51.560\n And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay\n\n2:18:51.560 --> 2:18:53.800\n because my interpretation of the essay\n\n2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:56.200\n in assembly theory makes complete sense.\n\n2:18:57.520 --> 2:19:00.600\n Because you need an expanding universe\n\n2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:04.720\n in assembly theory to create novelty\n\n2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:07.240\n that you search for,\n\n2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:09.080\n that then when you find something interesting\n\n2:19:09.080 --> 2:19:10.840\n and you keep doing it because it's cool\n\n2:19:10.840 --> 2:19:13.280\n and it gives you an advantage,\n\n2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:15.480\n then it appears in the past to be a goal.\n\n2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:17.200\n So what does, in assembly theory,\n\n2:19:17.200 --> 2:19:19.840\n the expansion of the universe look like?\n\n2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:22.280\n What are we talking about?\n\n2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:26.520\n Why does the expansion of the universe\n\n2:19:26.520 --> 2:19:30.440\n give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?\n\n2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:32.280\n So for me, I don't think about the universe\n\n2:19:32.280 --> 2:19:34.160\n in terms of big bang and space.\n\n2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:37.800\n I think about it in terms of the big memory expansion.\n\n2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:39.360\n That you have one, you only have the ability\n\n2:19:39.360 --> 2:19:41.400\n to store one bit of information,\n\n2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:43.000\n so then you can't do very much.\n\n2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:46.640\n So what the universe has been doing since forever,\n\n2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:49.000\n it's been creating more,\n\n2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:53.280\n it's been increasing the size of its RAM, okay?\n\n2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:55.400\n So it's like one megabyte, two megabyte,\n\n2:19:55.400 --> 2:19:57.520\n three megabyte, four megabytes, all the way up.\n\n2:19:57.520 --> 2:20:00.720\n And so the more RAM you have,\n\n2:20:00.720 --> 2:20:04.280\n the more you can remember about the past,\n\n2:20:04.280 --> 2:20:07.120\n which allows you to do cooler things in the future.\n\n2:20:07.120 --> 2:20:09.680\n So if you can remember how to launch a rocket,\n\n2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:12.680\n then you might be able to imagine how to land a rocket,\n\n2:20:12.680 --> 2:20:15.040\n and then relaunch, reland, and carry on.\n\n2:20:15.040 --> 2:20:19.800\n And so you're able to expand the space\n\n2:20:19.800 --> 2:20:21.080\n and remember the past.\n\n2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:23.720\n And so that's why I think it's very important.\n\n2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:25.320\n But not a perfect memory.\n\n2:20:25.320 --> 2:20:27.000\n It's an interesting question,\n\n2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:28.880\n whether there's some forgetting that happens\n\n2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:30.480\n that might increase.\n\n2:20:30.480 --> 2:20:34.200\n Is the expansion of the forgetting, at some point,\n\n2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:37.120\n accelerate faster than the remembering?\n\n2:20:37.120 --> 2:20:38.960\n I think that that's a very important thing\n\n2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:40.800\n that probably intelligence does,\n\n2:20:40.800 --> 2:20:42.360\n and we're gonna learn in machine learning about,\n\n2:20:42.360 --> 2:20:44.400\n because you want machine learning right now,\n\n2:20:44.400 --> 2:20:45.720\n or artificial intelligence right now,\n\n2:20:45.720 --> 2:20:47.280\n doesn't have memory right,\n\n2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:49.120\n but you want the ability to,\n\n2:20:49.120 --> 2:20:52.760\n or not for, if you want to get to human like consciousness,\n\n2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:55.400\n you need to have the ability, I suppose, to remember stuff\n\n2:20:55.400 --> 2:20:57.040\n and then to selectively forget stuff\n\n2:20:57.040 --> 2:20:59.520\n so you can re remember it and compress it.\n\n2:20:59.520 --> 2:21:02.160\n Arguably, the way that we come up with new physical laws.\n\n2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:07.160\n I think that there is a great deal to be gained\n\n2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:15.960\n from having the ability to remember things,\n\n2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:18.000\n but then when you forget them,\n\n2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:18.960\n you can then have a,\n\n2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:20.800\n you can basically do the simulation again\n\n2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:23.920\n and work out if you get to that compressed representation.\n\n2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:25.280\n So that's in cycles.\n\n2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:29.560\n So cycles of remembering and forgetting\n\n2:21:29.560 --> 2:21:31.080\n are probably important,\n\n2:21:31.080 --> 2:21:33.640\n but there shouldn't be excuse to have a universe\n\n2:21:33.640 --> 2:21:34.480\n with no memory in it.\n\n2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:37.120\n The universe is gonna remember that it forgot,\n\n2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:38.200\n but just not tell you.\n\n2:21:40.300 --> 2:21:42.260\n I'm looking at this paper\n\n2:21:42.260 --> 2:21:44.760\n and it's talking about a puppet controlling a puppet\n\n2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:46.960\n controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling\n\n2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:48.200\n a puppet controlling a puppet,\n\n2:21:48.200 --> 2:21:49.480\n conceptually easy to understand,\n\n2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:50.640\n but physically impossible,\n\n2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:53.600\n as physically impossible as predicting a fair coin toss.\n\n2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:54.960\n I don't know what he's talking about,\n\n2:21:54.960 --> 2:21:58.600\n but there's pictures of puppets controlling puppets.\n\n2:21:58.600 --> 2:21:59.640\n Let me ask you,\n\n2:21:59.640 --> 2:22:01.760\n there's a few things I wanna ask,\n\n2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:04.600\n but we brought up time quite a bit.\n\n2:22:04.600 --> 2:22:07.100\n You guys tweet about time quite a bit.\n\n2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:10.760\n What is time in all of this?\n\n2:22:10.760 --> 2:22:12.400\n We kind of mentioned it a bunch.\n\n2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:15.840\n Is it not important at all in terms of,\n\n2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:16.880\n is it just a word?\n\n2:22:16.880 --> 2:22:18.840\n Should we be talking about causality mostly?\n\n2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:20.360\n Like Sarah, what do you think?\n\n2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:24.160\n Is, we've talked about like memories.\n\n2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:25.440\n Is that the fundamental thing\n\n2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:26.560\n that we should be thinking about?\n\n2:22:26.560 --> 2:22:29.680\n And time is just a useful measurement device or something\n\n2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:30.580\n like that.\n\n2:22:30.580 --> 2:22:32.360\n Well, there's different concepts of time, right?\n\n2:22:32.360 --> 2:22:33.720\n So I think in assembly theory,\n\n2:22:33.720 --> 2:22:34.560\n when we're talking about time,\n\n2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:36.200\n we're talking about the ordering of things.\n\n2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:38.280\n So that's the causal graph part.\n\n2:22:38.280 --> 2:22:40.720\n And so then the fundamental structure of the universe\n\n2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:42.840\n is that there is a certain ordering\n\n2:22:42.840 --> 2:22:44.660\n and certain things can't happen till other things happen.\n\n2:22:44.660 --> 2:22:48.600\n But usually when we colloquially talk about time,\n\n2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:50.440\n we're talking about the flow of time.\n\n2:22:51.440 --> 2:22:52.960\n And I guess Lee and I were actually debating\n\n2:22:52.960 --> 2:22:53.920\n about this this morning.\n\n2:22:53.920 --> 2:22:56.680\n So in talking on it, walking on the river here,\n\n2:22:56.680 --> 2:23:00.080\n which is a very lovely spot for talking about time,\n\n2:23:00.080 --> 2:23:02.540\n but that when the universe is updating,\n\n2:23:02.540 --> 2:23:05.840\n it's transitioning between things that exist now\n\n2:23:05.840 --> 2:23:07.140\n and things that exist now.\n\n2:23:09.140 --> 2:23:11.720\n That's really the flow of time.\n\n2:23:11.720 --> 2:23:15.700\n So you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum.\n\n2:23:15.700 --> 2:23:17.880\n And then there's also an arrow of time\n\n2:23:17.880 --> 2:23:19.360\n that people talk about in physics,\n\n2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:21.960\n which is that time doesn't appear to have a directionality\n\n2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:25.200\n in fundamental physics, but it does to us, right?\n\n2:23:25.200 --> 2:23:26.840\n Like we can't go backwards in time.\n\n2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:29.260\n And usually that would be explained in physics\n\n2:23:29.260 --> 2:23:32.160\n in terms of, well, there's a cosmological arrow of time,\n\n2:23:32.160 --> 2:23:33.880\n but there's also the thermodynamic arrow of time\n\n2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:35.040\n of increasing entropy.\n\n2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:37.840\n But what we would say in assembly theory\n\n2:23:37.840 --> 2:23:39.320\n is that there is a clear directionality.\n\n2:23:39.320 --> 2:23:40.960\n The universe only runs in one direction,\n\n2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:42.840\n which is why some things, it's easy to make,\n\n2:23:42.840 --> 2:23:45.440\n if the universe runs in one direction,\n\n2:23:45.440 --> 2:23:47.600\n it's easy to make processes look reversible.\n\n2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:49.580\n For example, if they have no memory,\n\n2:23:49.580 --> 2:23:51.040\n they're easy to run forward and backwards,\n\n2:23:51.040 --> 2:23:52.960\n which is why the laws of physics that we have now\n\n2:23:52.960 --> 2:23:55.640\n look the way they do, because they involve objects\n\n2:23:55.640 --> 2:23:56.600\n that have no memory.\n\n2:23:56.600 --> 2:23:58.320\n But when you get to things like us,\n\n2:23:58.320 --> 2:23:59.840\n it becomes very clear that the universe\n\n2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:01.480\n has a directionality associated to it.\n\n2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:03.120\n So it's not reversible at all.\n\n2:24:03.120 --> 2:24:06.400\n It's the no man ever steps in the same river.\n\n2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:07.400\n I just have to bring that out\n\n2:24:07.400 --> 2:24:08.400\n because you walked on the river.\n\n2:24:08.400 --> 2:24:11.160\n No man ever steps in the same river twice\n\n2:24:11.160 --> 2:24:14.360\n before he's not the same river and he's not the same man.\n\n2:24:14.360 --> 2:24:16.840\n So it's not reversible, any of the same.\n\n2:24:16.840 --> 2:24:19.520\n No, but reversibility is an emergent property, right?\n\n2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:22.160\n So we think of the reversibility laws as being fundamental\n\n2:24:22.160 --> 2:24:23.960\n and the irreversibility as being emergent.\n\n2:24:23.960 --> 2:24:26.880\n But I think what we would say from how we think about it,\n\n2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:28.640\n and it certainly seems to be the case\n\n2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:29.680\n for our perception of time,\n\n2:24:29.680 --> 2:24:33.380\n but also what's happening in biological evolution,\n\n2:24:33.380 --> 2:24:35.400\n you can make things reversible,\n\n2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:37.280\n but it requires work to do it.\n\n2:24:37.280 --> 2:24:39.000\n And it requires certain machines\n\n2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:40.520\n to run it forward and backward.\n\n2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:42.840\n And Chiara Marletto is working some interesting ideas\n\n2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:44.720\n on constructor theory related to that,\n\n2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:46.400\n which is a totally different set of ideas.\n\n2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:49.680\n You can travel back in time sometimes.\n\n2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:50.520\n Yes.\n\n2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:54.160\n You can't travel actually back in time,\n\n2:24:54.160 --> 2:24:56.360\n but you could reconstruct things\n\n2:24:56.360 --> 2:24:58.000\n that have existed in the past.\n\n2:24:58.000 --> 2:24:59.400\n You're always moving forward in time,\n\n2:24:59.400 --> 2:25:01.240\n but you can cycle through.\n\n2:25:01.240 --> 2:25:02.080\n Like, I mean, I can...\n\n2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:02.900\n Can I clarify what you just said?\n\n2:25:02.900 --> 2:25:03.740\n Yeah, yeah, go for it.\n\n2:25:03.740 --> 2:25:06.260\n Quickly, you travel forward in time to travel back.\n\n2:25:06.260 --> 2:25:07.460\n Yes.\n\n2:25:07.460 --> 2:25:09.720\n Thank you, that really clarified it.\n\n2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:12.480\n What Sarah's saying is you don't go back in time,\n\n2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:14.840\n you recreate what happened in the past in the future\n\n2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:15.880\n and inspect it again.\n\n2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:17.400\n So in that local pocket of time,\n\n2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:19.160\n it's as if you travel back in time.\n\n2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:20.360\n So I don't...\n\n2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:22.280\n How is that not traveling back in time?\n\n2:25:22.280 --> 2:25:23.120\n Because you're not going back\n\n2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:24.860\n to your same self back in time.\n\n2:25:24.860 --> 2:25:27.280\n You're creating that in the future.\n\n2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:29.580\n But everything else is the same as it was in the past.\n\n2:25:29.580 --> 2:25:32.800\n No, no, no, no, it's not in registry.\n\n2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:35.180\n I mean, it goes back to the big question I'm saying.\n\n2:25:35.180 --> 2:25:38.480\n I mean, this is something I was trying to look up today\n\n2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:40.400\n when we first had this discussion\n\n2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:42.240\n and I was talking to Sarah on Skype and said,\n\n2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:45.920\n by the way, time is the fundamental thing in the universe.\n\n2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:47.440\n She almost hung up on me.\n\n2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:48.600\n Right, but you can even...\n\n2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:51.040\n I mean, if you wanna make an analogy to computation,\n\n2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:52.920\n and I think Charles Bennett actually has a paper on this\n\n2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:55.100\n like about reversible computation\n\n2:25:55.100 --> 2:25:57.000\n and reversible Turing machines.\n\n2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:58.160\n In order to make it reversible,\n\n2:25:58.160 --> 2:26:01.240\n you have to store memory to run the process backwards.\n\n2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:04.560\n So time is always running forward in that\n\n2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:05.400\n because you have to write the memory.\n\n2:26:05.400 --> 2:26:06.640\n You can't erase the memory.\n\n2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:08.120\n You can erase the memory,\n\n2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:11.300\n but the point when you go back to zero, right?\n\n2:26:11.300 --> 2:26:15.320\n But the whole point is that in order to have a process\n\n2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:17.400\n that even runs in both directions,\n\n2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:19.080\n you have to start talking about memory\n\n2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:21.740\n to store the information to run it backwards.\n\n2:26:21.740 --> 2:26:22.580\n I got it.\n\n2:26:22.580 --> 2:26:24.640\n So you can't really then...\n\n2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:27.080\n You can't have it exactly how it was in the past.\n\n2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:27.920\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:30.960\n You have extra stuff, extra baggage always.\n\n2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:31.800\n Okay.\n\n2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:33.400\n A really important thing that I want to say on this,\n\n2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:34.240\n I think if I try and get it right,\n\n2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:36.480\n I have to say that if you can think\n\n2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:38.280\n that the universe is expanding\n\n2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:41.400\n in terms of the number of boxes\n\n2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:44.960\n that it has to store states, right?\n\n2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:47.240\n And this is where the directionality of the universe\n\n2:26:47.240 --> 2:26:48.960\n comes from, everything comes from.\n\n2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:51.140\n You could erase what's in those boxes,\n\n2:26:51.140 --> 2:26:54.240\n but the fact you've now got so many boxes at time now\n\n2:26:54.240 --> 2:26:56.640\n in this present, there's more of those boxes\n\n2:26:56.640 --> 2:26:57.840\n than there were in the past.\n\n2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:00.820\n See, but the boxes aren't physical boxes.\n\n2:27:00.820 --> 2:27:03.440\n They're not space or time.\n\n2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:05.720\n Why is the number of boxes always expanding?\n\n2:27:05.720 --> 2:27:07.840\n It's very hard to imagine this\n\n2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:09.640\n because we live in space.\n\n2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:14.400\n So what I'm saying, which is I think probably correct,\n\n2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:17.800\n is that we just, let's just imagine for a second,\n\n2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:20.560\n there is a nonlocal situation,\n\n2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:23.420\n but there are these things called states\n\n2:27:23.420 --> 2:27:26.960\n and that the universe irrespective\n\n2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:28.920\n of whether you measure anything,\n\n2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:31.520\n there is a universal, let's call it a clock\n\n2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:33.440\n or a state creator.\n\n2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:36.480\n Maybe we can call it, that's why maybe you can call it God,\n\n2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:37.920\n but let's call it a state creator\n\n2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:39.540\n where the universe is expanding\n\n2:27:39.540 --> 2:27:41.600\n in the number of states it has.\n\n2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:43.280\n Why are you saying it's expanding though?\n\n2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:44.680\n Is that obvious that it's expanding?\n\n2:27:44.680 --> 2:27:46.360\n It's obvious because that's where the,\n\n2:27:46.360 --> 2:27:49.080\n because we, we.\n\n2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:50.300\n That's a source of novelty.\n\n2:27:50.300 --> 2:27:51.860\n It's a source of novelty\n\n2:27:51.860 --> 2:27:55.100\n and it also explains why the universe is not predictable.\n\n2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:57.680\n How do you know it's not predictable?\n\n2:27:57.680 --> 2:27:59.160\n I just like interrupting you.\n\n2:27:59.160 --> 2:28:01.480\n Sorry, it's fun, because you're struggling.\n\n2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:03.680\n I'm struggling because I'm trying to be\n\n2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:06.720\n as concrete as possible and not sound like I'm insane.\n\n2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:07.680\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:07.680 --> 2:28:08.640\n And I'm not insane.\n\n2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:10.520\n It's obvious because you,\n\n2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:14.320\n I'm a chemist.\n\n2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:17.320\n So as a chemist, I grew into the world\n\n2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:19.440\n understanding irreversibility.\n\n2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:21.120\n Irreversibility is all I knew.\n\n2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.600\n And when people start telling me\n\n2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:27.320\n the universe is actually reversible, it's a magic trick.\n\n2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:28.560\n We can use time to do it.\n\n2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:32.680\n So what I mean is that the second law\n\n2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:37.680\n is really the magical.\n\n2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:40.000\n But why does it need to be magical?\n\n2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:41.560\n The universe is just asymmetric.\n\n2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:43.680\n All I'm saying is the universe is asymmetric\n\n2:28:43.680 --> 2:28:48.040\n in the state production and we can erase those states,\n\n2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:50.440\n but we just have more computational power.\n\n2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:53.520\n So what I'm saying is that the universe's\n\n2:28:53.520 --> 2:28:55.640\n deterministic horizon,\n\n2:28:55.640 --> 2:28:57.460\n this is one of the reasons we can't live in a simulation,\n\n2:28:57.460 --> 2:29:01.120\n by the way, you can't live in a simulation.\n\n2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:02.800\n The irreversibility.\n\n2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:04.080\n Yeah, yeah, so basically every time\n\n2:29:04.080 --> 2:29:06.120\n you try and simulate the universe,\n\n2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:07.600\n in this, you know, I live in a simulation,\n\n2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:09.160\n the universe is expanded in states.\n\n2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:10.000\n You're like, oh damn it,\n\n2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:11.320\n I need to make my computer bigger again.\n\n2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:13.480\n And every time you try and contain the universe\n\n2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:14.620\n in the computation,\n\n2:29:14.620 --> 2:29:16.680\n because it's got bigger in number of states.\n\n2:29:16.680 --> 2:29:21.360\n And so I'm saying the fact the universe has novelty in it\n\n2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:25.280\n is going to turn out experimentally to be proof\n\n2:29:25.280 --> 2:29:30.240\n that time, as I've labeled it, is fundamental\n\n2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:34.960\n and exists as a physical thing that creates space.\n\n2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:37.720\n Okay, so if you can prove that novelty\n\n2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:39.640\n is always being created,\n\n2:29:39.640 --> 2:29:41.920\n you're saying that it's possible to also then prove\n\n2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:45.520\n that it's always expanding in the state space.\n\n2:29:45.520 --> 2:29:48.200\n Those are things that have to be proven.\n\n2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:50.000\n That's what we're working on experiments for, yeah.\n\n2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:52.680\n And you're trying to, like by looking at the sliver\n\n2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:56.400\n of reality, show that there's always novelty being generated.\n\n2:29:56.400 --> 2:29:59.160\n Yeah, because if we go live in a universe\n\n2:29:59.160 --> 2:30:01.760\n that conventional physicists would live in,\n\n2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:05.000\n it's a big lookup table of stuff and everything exists.\n\n2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:10.000\n I want to prove that that book doesn't exist,\n\n2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:12.320\n it's continuously being added pages on.\n\n2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:14.540\n So all I'm saying, if the universe is a book,\n\n2:30:14.540 --> 2:30:17.600\n we started, the universe at the beginning only had no pages\n\n2:30:17.600 --> 2:30:19.940\n and had one page, another page, another page.\n\n2:30:19.940 --> 2:30:22.360\n Whereas a physicist would now say all the pages exist\n\n2:30:22.360 --> 2:30:24.680\n and we could in principle access them.\n\n2:30:24.680 --> 2:30:27.160\n I'm saying that is fundamentally incorrect.\n\n2:30:27.160 --> 2:30:29.240\n Do you know what's written in this book?\n\n2:30:29.240 --> 2:30:30.520\n The free will question.\n\n2:30:32.200 --> 2:30:35.760\n Is there room for free will in this view\n\n2:30:38.440 --> 2:30:40.680\n of the universe is generating novelty\n\n2:30:40.680 --> 2:30:45.680\n and getting greater and greater assembly structures built?\n\n2:30:45.740 --> 2:30:46.840\n Sarah.\n\n2:30:46.840 --> 2:30:48.160\n Yes.\n\n2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:49.000\n Okay.\n\n2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:49.920\n Done.\n\n2:30:49.920 --> 2:30:51.040\n Next question.\n\n2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:53.120\n Why, what's the source of free will in this?\n\n2:30:53.120 --> 2:30:58.120\n Well, I think it depends on what you mean by free will, but.\n\n2:30:58.320 --> 2:31:00.640\n Yeah, well, please, there's a lot.\n\n2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:02.500\n I think what I'm interested in\n\n2:31:02.500 --> 2:31:06.720\n as far as the phenomena of free will is,\n\n2:31:06.720 --> 2:31:10.560\n do we have individual autonomy and agency?\n\n2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:13.580\n And when I do things, is it really me\n\n2:31:13.580 --> 2:31:15.480\n or is it my atoms that did it?\n\n2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:19.200\n And that's the part that's interesting to me.\n\n2:31:19.200 --> 2:31:23.160\n I guess there's also the determinism versus randomness part.\n\n2:31:23.160 --> 2:31:25.620\n But the way I think about it is like each of us\n\n2:31:25.620 --> 2:31:30.140\n are like a thread or like an assembly space\n\n2:31:30.140 --> 2:31:33.640\n through this giant possibility space.\n\n2:31:33.640 --> 2:31:37.080\n And it's like we're moving on our own trajectory\n\n2:31:37.080 --> 2:31:39.640\n through that space and that is defined by our history.\n\n2:31:39.640 --> 2:31:42.640\n So we're sort of causally contingent on our past,\n\n2:31:42.640 --> 2:31:46.680\n but also because of the sort of intersection\n\n2:31:46.680 --> 2:31:50.800\n of novelty generation, it's not completely predetermined\n\n2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:52.160\n by the past.\n\n2:31:52.160 --> 2:31:55.840\n And so then you have the causal control\n\n2:31:55.840 --> 2:31:59.480\n of the determinism part that you are your causal history\n\n2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:01.580\n and there's some determinism from that past,\n\n2:32:01.580 --> 2:32:04.480\n but there's also room for creativity.\n\n2:32:04.480 --> 2:32:06.760\n And I think it's actually necessary\n\n2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:08.780\n that something like free will exists\n\n2:32:08.780 --> 2:32:11.420\n if the universe is gonna be as creative as possible.\n\n2:32:11.420 --> 2:32:16.400\n Because if I were all intelligent being,\n\n2:32:16.400 --> 2:32:19.960\n inventing a universe, and I wanted it to have\n\n2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:22.520\n maximum number of interesting things happen,\n\n2:32:22.520 --> 2:32:25.560\n again, we should come up with the metric of interesting,\n\n2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:28.100\n but generating, yes, I know,\n\n2:32:28.100 --> 2:32:31.840\n generating maximal possibilities,\n\n2:32:31.840 --> 2:32:33.780\n then I would want the agents to have free will\n\n2:32:33.780 --> 2:32:38.300\n because it means that they're more individual,\n\n2:32:38.300 --> 2:32:41.860\n like each entity actually is a different causal force\n\n2:32:41.860 --> 2:32:43.400\n in the universe.\n\n2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:46.620\n And it's intrinsic and local property of that system.\n\n2:32:46.620 --> 2:32:50.480\n There's a greater number of distributed agents?\n\n2:32:50.480 --> 2:32:54.540\n Like are you always creating more and more individuality?\n\n2:32:54.540 --> 2:32:56.040\n Kind of.\n\n2:32:56.040 --> 2:32:59.000\n I would say you're creating more causal power, but.\n\n2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:01.680\n So causal power, the word consciousness,\n\n2:33:01.680 --> 2:33:05.200\n is the causal power somehow correlated with consciousness?\n\n2:33:05.200 --> 2:33:07.200\n I mean, that's why I have this conception\n\n2:33:07.200 --> 2:33:09.120\n of consciousness being related to imagination,\n\n2:33:09.120 --> 2:33:11.320\n because the more that we can imagine can happen\n\n2:33:11.320 --> 2:33:14.760\n and the more counterfactual possibilities you have in mind,\n\n2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:16.280\n the more you can actually implement.\n\n2:33:16.280 --> 2:33:18.200\n And somehow free will is also at the intersection\n\n2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:20.400\n of the counterfactual becoming the actual.\n\n2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:23.660\n So can you elaborate on that a little bit,\n\n2:33:23.660 --> 2:33:25.800\n that consciousness is imagination?\n\n2:33:25.800 --> 2:33:27.600\n I don't know exactly how to articulate it,\n\n2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:31.360\n and I'm sure people will aim at certain things I'm saying,\n\n2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:33.120\n but I think the language is really imprecise,\n\n2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:35.440\n so I'm not the best way to.\n\n2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:37.600\n It's really interesting, like what is imagination\n\n2:33:37.600 --> 2:33:42.600\n and what role does it play in the human experience,\n\n2:33:42.920 --> 2:33:44.520\n in the experience of any agent?\n\n2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:46.360\n Yes, I love imagination.\n\n2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:49.480\n I think it's like the most amazing thing we do.\n\n2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:51.420\n But I guess one way I would think about it is,\n\n2:33:51.420 --> 2:33:52.880\n we talked about the transition to life\n\n2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:55.000\n being the universe acquiring memory,\n\n2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:56.680\n and life does something really interesting.\n\n2:33:56.680 --> 2:33:58.660\n You just think about biology generally.\n\n2:33:58.660 --> 2:34:00.620\n It remembers states of the past to adapt\n\n2:34:00.620 --> 2:34:01.960\n to things that happen in the future.\n\n2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:04.760\n So the longer life has evolved on this planet,\n\n2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:06.600\n the deeper that past is, the more memory we have,\n\n2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:08.760\n the more kinds of organisms and things.\n\n2:34:08.760 --> 2:34:11.540\n But what human level intelligence has done\n\n2:34:11.540 --> 2:34:12.700\n is quite different.\n\n2:34:12.700 --> 2:34:14.640\n It's not just that we remember states\n\n2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:16.920\n that the universe has existed in before,\n\n2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:19.640\n it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed,\n\n2:34:19.640 --> 2:34:22.560\n and we can actually make them come into existence.\n\n2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:25.240\n And I think that's the most unique feature\n\n2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:27.520\n about the transition to whatever we are\n\n2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:30.300\n from what life on this planet has been doing\n\n2:34:30.300 --> 2:34:32.000\n for the last four billion years.\n\n2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:33.760\n And I think it's deeply related to the phenomenon\n\n2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:34.880\n we call consciousness.\n\n2:34:34.880 --> 2:34:36.280\n Yeah, I was gonna, I mean, just agree with that.\n\n2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:38.300\n I think that consciousness is the ability\n\n2:34:38.300 --> 2:34:40.400\n to generate those counterfactuals.\n\n2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:41.560\n Now, whether you can say, you know,\n\n2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:43.080\n are there degrees of consciousness?\n\n2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:47.740\n I mean, I'm sorry, panpsychist,\n\n2:34:47.740 --> 2:34:49.960\n but electrons don't have counterfactuals,\n\n2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:51.480\n although they do have some kind of,\n\n2:34:51.480 --> 2:34:53.440\n they are able to search a space and pathways.\n\n2:34:53.440 --> 2:34:58.140\n But I think that there is a very concrete,\n\n2:34:58.140 --> 2:35:01.640\n or concrete, there's a very specific property\n\n2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:05.100\n that humans have, and I don't know if it's unique to humans.\n\n2:35:05.100 --> 2:35:09.000\n I mean, maybe dogs can do it, and birds can do it, right?\n\n2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:11.700\n And where they are basically solving a problem,\n\n2:35:11.700 --> 2:35:13.700\n because consciousness was invented,\n\n2:35:13.700 --> 2:35:16.360\n or this abstraction was invented by evolution\n\n2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:18.180\n for a specific reason.\n\n2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:23.080\n And so look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion\n\n2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:26.360\n that time was fundamental was actually because\n\n2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:30.240\n Sarah and I had a completely different.\n\n2:35:30.240 --> 2:35:32.520\n The most heated debate on Skype chat ever.\n\n2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:34.200\n No, no, no, we had to, I was like.\n\n2:35:34.200 --> 2:35:35.040\n Stop it.\n\n2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:37.600\n No, no, it goes back to the free will thing.\n\n2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:40.600\n So I think that, although I've changed my view a bit,\n\n2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:42.480\n because there's some really interesting physicists\n\n2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:45.840\n out there who talks about how the measurement problem\n\n2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:49.280\n in Newtonian space, but I don't want to go there just now,\n\n2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:50.400\n because I think I'll mess it up.\n\n2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:54.760\n But briefly, I could not see how the universe,\n\n2:35:54.760 --> 2:35:56.040\n how we can have free will.\n\n2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:57.120\n And I mean, this is really boring,\n\n2:35:57.120 --> 2:35:59.480\n because this is like, this is a well trodden path,\n\n2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:01.800\n but I mean, not so boring.\n\n2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:04.160\n I suppose it's kind of, we just want to be precise.\n\n2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:05.920\n If the universe is deterministic,\n\n2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:07.960\n how can we have free will, right?\n\n2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:11.080\n So Sarah's a physicist.\n\n2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:15.360\n I think she, not believe, can show that most of the laws\n\n2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:17.840\n we have are deterministic to some degree.\n\n2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:20.280\n Quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff.\n\n2:36:20.280 --> 2:36:22.360\n And yet there's Sarah telling me she believes in free will.\n\n2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:26.840\n And I'm like, your belief system's broken here, right?\n\n2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:29.720\n Because you're demanding free will\n\n2:36:29.720 --> 2:36:32.160\n in a deterministic universe.\n\n2:36:32.160 --> 2:36:36.400\n And then I realized that I agreed with her\n\n2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:39.240\n that I do think that free will is a thing\n\n2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:41.440\n because we are able to search for novelty.\n\n2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:43.120\n And then that's where I came to the conclusion\n\n2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:46.400\n that time, the universe is expanding in terms of novelty.\n\n2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:48.400\n And it goes back to that Dan Dennett essay\n\n2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:51.200\n that we're talking about, the free will inflation.\n\n2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:54.680\n Free will, so you have, so the past,\n\n2:36:55.600 --> 2:36:56.840\n it did not exist in the past.\n\n2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:58.760\n The past exists in the present.\n\n2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:01.640\n What I mean is like, you are the, there was no past.\n\n2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:02.760\n There is only present.\n\n2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:05.200\n So that means you are the sum total.\n\n2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:06.840\n Everything that's occurs in the past\n\n2:37:06.840 --> 2:37:09.680\n is manifestly here in the present.\n\n2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:12.640\n And then you have this little echo state\n\n2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:14.760\n in your consciousness because you're able to,\n\n2:37:14.760 --> 2:37:18.240\n you're able to imagine something without actualization.\n\n2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:20.800\n But the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons\n\n2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:23.720\n and potassium ion flows in your neural network\n\n2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:24.680\n in your brain.\n\n2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:27.280\n Maybe consciousness is just the present.\n\n2:37:27.280 --> 2:37:31.560\n So somehow you imagine that, and then by imagining,\n\n2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:33.280\n oh, that's good, yeah.\n\n2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:36.280\n I'm gonna make a robot to do this thing and program it.\n\n2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:39.040\n And then you physically then go and do it.\n\n2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:42.080\n So that then changes the future, sorry.\n\n2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:43.240\n What's imagination?\n\n2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:46.000\n Does it require the past?\n\n2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:47.680\n Does it require the future?\n\n2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:48.880\n Does it require memory?\n\n2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:49.720\n Does it?\n\n2:37:49.720 --> 2:37:51.320\n It's imagination.\n\n2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:53.080\n Does it only exist in the moment?\n\n2:37:53.080 --> 2:37:57.120\n So imagination is, well, yeah, probably\n\n2:37:57.120 --> 2:37:59.200\n it's an instantaneous readout of what's going on.\n\n2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:01.320\n You can maybe, your subconscious brain\n\n2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:03.640\n has been generating all the bits for it,\n\n2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:07.400\n but no, imagination occurs when you,\n\n2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:10.000\n in your game engine, you remember the past\n\n2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:11.680\n and you integrate sensory to the present\n\n2:38:11.680 --> 2:38:14.200\n and you try and work out what you want to do in the future.\n\n2:38:14.200 --> 2:38:16.080\n And then you go and make that happen.\n\n2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:19.200\n So the imagination is this, it's like, imagine,\n\n2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:22.160\n asking what imagination is about, asking what surfing is.\n\n2:38:22.160 --> 2:38:26.240\n You can see, you can surfboard, surfer, wave coming in.\n\n2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:28.480\n When you're on that wave and you're surfing,\n\n2:38:28.480 --> 2:38:31.320\n that's where the imagination is.\n\n2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:34.160\n I think imagination is just accessing things\n\n2:38:34.160 --> 2:38:36.120\n that aren't the present moment in the present moment.\n\n2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:38.800\n So like I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the table\n\n2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:43.280\n and I can imagine the river and things or whatever it was.\n\n2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:45.680\n And so it seems to be that it's like,\n\n2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:50.600\n it's our ability to access things that aren't present.\n\n2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:53.880\n So conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin\n\n2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:57.320\n to something that happened to you recently.\n\n2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:58.960\n Right, but they don't have to be things\n\n2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:00.680\n that actually happened in your past.\n\n2:39:00.680 --> 2:39:02.520\n And I think this gets back to assembly theory.\n\n2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:04.920\n Like the way I would think about imagination\n\n2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:06.600\n from an assembly theoretic standpoint\n\n2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:11.600\n is I'm a giant causal graph and I exist in a present moment\n\n2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:14.040\n as a particular configuration of Sarah.\n\n2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:18.640\n But there's a lot of, I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage.\n\n2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:20.000\n I have that whole causal history\n\n2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.360\n and I can access parts of it.\n\n2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:24.240\n Now, when you talk about getting to something\n\n2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:27.080\n as complex as us, having as large assembly space as us,\n\n2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:29.680\n there's ways of, like, there's a lot of things\n\n2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:33.560\n in that causal graph that have ever actually never existed\n\n2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:35.440\n in the past history of the universe\n\n2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:36.680\n because like the universe got big enough\n\n2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:40.920\n to contain the three of us in this room in time,\n\n2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:45.520\n but not all the features of each one of us individually\n\n2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:48.880\n have come into existence as physical objects\n\n2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:50.440\n we would recognize as individual objects.\n\n2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:51.280\n This goes back to your point\n\n2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:52.440\n that we actually have to explain\n\n2:39:52.440 --> 2:39:56.120\n why things actually even look like objects\n\n2:39:56.120 --> 2:39:58.720\n and aren't just a smear of mass.\n\n2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:03.320\n And just on the free will and physics thing,\n\n2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:05.280\n when you were talking, I was, I just wanna bring this up\n\n2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:06.680\n because I think it's a really interesting viewpoint\n\n2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:09.840\n that Nicholas Jisen has that, you know,\n\n2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:11.320\n like we wanna use the laws of physics\n\n2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:12.640\n and then say you can't have free will.\n\n2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:15.080\n And his point is you have to have free will\n\n2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:17.120\n in order to even choose to set up an experiment\n\n2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:18.160\n to test the laws of physics.\n\n2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:20.720\n So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental\n\n2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:23.320\n than physics is because to even do science,\n\n2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:28.320\n there's some assumption that the agents have free will.\n\n2:40:28.320 --> 2:40:30.080\n And I always thought it was really perplexing\n\n2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:33.960\n that, you know, physics wants to remove agency\n\n2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:35.960\n because the idea that I could do an experiment here\n\n2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:38.160\n on this part of earth and then I can move somewhere else\n\n2:40:38.160 --> 2:40:39.880\n and prepare an identically, you know,\n\n2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:43.040\n identically prepared experiment, run an experiment again,\n\n2:40:43.040 --> 2:40:45.680\n seems to imply something about the structure of our universe\n\n2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:47.200\n that is not encoded in the laws\n\n2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:49.800\n that we're testing in those experiments.\n\n2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:51.400\n So this kind of dream of physics\n\n2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:53.600\n that you can do multiple experiments, different locations\n\n2:40:53.600 --> 2:40:55.760\n and then validate each other,\n\n2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:59.160\n you're saying that's an illusion?\n\n2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:01.840\n No, I'm saying that requires decision making\n\n2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:04.120\n and free will to be a real thing, I think.\n\n2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:06.200\n Like I think the fact that we can do science\n\n2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:08.000\n is not arbitrary.\n\n2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:09.880\n And I think people, you know,\n\n2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:11.680\n the standard canon in physics would be,\n\n2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:12.920\n well, you could trace all of that back\n\n2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:14.240\n to the initial condition of the universe,\n\n2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:16.040\n but the whole point of science is\n\n2:41:16.040 --> 2:41:18.360\n I can imagine doing the experiment and I can do it\n\n2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:19.720\n and then I can do it again and again and again\n\n2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:20.640\n all over the planet.\n\n2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:23.000\n To you, imagination is somehow fundamentally\n\n2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.120\n generative of novelty.\n\n2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:25.960\n Yes.\n\n2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:27.600\n So it's not like the universe could have predicted\n\n2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:28.880\n the things you imagined.\n\n2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:31.240\n Imagination, so coming back to novelty,\n\n2:41:31.240 --> 2:41:33.480\n I think novelty can exist outside of imagination,\n\n2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:36.320\n but it supercharges it, it's another transition, I think.\n\n2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:37.640\n I mean, I would say,\n\n2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:39.040\n I mean, this may be a boring statement,\n\n2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:40.760\n but I would say the fact that, sorry?\n\n2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:42.680\n I'm not sure, these are hard questions.\n\n2:41:42.680 --> 2:41:45.000\n Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that objects exist\n\n2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:48.440\n is yet another proof that time is fundamental\n\n2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:50.480\n and novelty exists, right?\n\n2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:53.000\n Because I think, again, if you ask a physicist\n\n2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.600\n to write down in their infinite Bible of the universe,\n\n2:41:55.600 --> 2:41:58.200\n let's call it the Bible, the Mac, you know.\n\n2:41:58.200 --> 2:41:59.040\n The book.\n\n2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:01.600\n Yeah, well, I mean, the mathematical universe,\n\n2:42:01.600 --> 2:42:03.880\n whether you're Max Tegmark or Sean Carroll\n\n2:42:03.880 --> 2:42:05.120\n or Frank Wilczek.\n\n2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:11.320\n Or Stephen Wolfram, okay?\n\n2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:12.160\n I like that book.\n\n2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:13.360\n Yeah, I love it too.\n\n2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:15.080\n It's lots of pretty pictures.\n\n2:42:15.080 --> 2:42:18.240\n It's really interesting that they cope with the enormity\n\n2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:19.320\n of the universe by saying,\n\n2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:22.080\n well, it's all there, mathematics, it all exists, right?\n\n2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:25.360\n And I would say that that's why I'm excited\n\n2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:26.480\n about the future of the universe\n\n2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:31.400\n because although it is somehow dependent upon the past,\n\n2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:35.700\n it is not constrained just by the past,\n\n2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:38.680\n which is kind of mad.\n\n2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:40.880\n Yeah, that's what free will is.\n\n2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:42.520\n It's not constrained by the past.\n\n2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:44.400\n It's dependent on the past.\n\n2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:46.440\n This moment, it's not just dependent,\n\n2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:48.240\n this moment is the past,\n\n2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:49.600\n and yet it has the capacity\n\n2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:52.960\n to generate a totally unpredictable future.\n\n2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:54.040\n I mean, the other thing I would say\n\n2:42:54.040 --> 2:42:56.360\n that's super important for human beings, right?\n\n2:42:56.360 --> 2:42:59.200\n Human beings have actually very little causal control\n\n2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:00.680\n in the future.\n\n2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:02.280\n I realized this the other week.\n\n2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:03.440\n Oh, the immediate future immediately.\n\n2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:04.920\n Yeah, yeah, so what happened,\n\n2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:06.220\n so this is what I think it is.\n\n2:43:06.220 --> 2:43:09.160\n The way, by reinterpreting your past,\n\n2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:11.320\n I mean, talk about from a kind of cognitive,\n\n2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:13.060\n psychological cognitive point of view,\n\n2:43:13.060 --> 2:43:17.880\n by reinterpreting your past in your current mind,\n\n2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:21.280\n you could actually help you shape your future again.\n\n2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:25.280\n So you have much more freedom to interpret your past,\n\n2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:28.220\n to act in the present, to change your future,\n\n2:43:28.220 --> 2:43:29.560\n than you do to change your future.\n\n2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:31.720\n It may sound weird, so I'm saying to everybody,\n\n2:43:31.720 --> 2:43:33.820\n imagine your past, think about your past,\n\n2:43:33.820 --> 2:43:37.520\n reinterpret your past in the nicest way you can,\n\n2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:39.400\n then imagine what you can do next,\n\n2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:41.240\n or imagine your past in a more negative way\n\n2:43:41.240 --> 2:43:42.060\n and what you do next,\n\n2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:45.160\n and look at those two counterfactuals, they're different.\n\n2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:46.000\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:47.120\n I mean, Daniel Kahneman talks about this\n\n2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:49.600\n that most of our life is lived in our memories.\n\n2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:51.560\n It's interesting, because you can essentially,\n\n2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:53.880\n in imagination, choose the life you live.\n\n2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:56.680\n So maybe free will exists in imagination.\n\n2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:00.400\n Choices are made in your imagination,\n\n2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:03.640\n and that results in you basically able to control\n\n2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:06.920\n how the future unrolls, because you're like,\n\n2:44:06.920 --> 2:44:10.160\n imagining, like reinterpreting constantly\n\n2:44:10.160 --> 2:44:11.440\n the things that happen to you.\n\n2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:13.680\n Exactly, so if you want to increase\n\n2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:16.400\n your amount of free will, those people that have,\n\n2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:18.720\n I don't think everyone has equal amounts of agency,\n\n2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:22.480\n because of our sad constraints,\n\n2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:26.580\n where they're happenstance, health, economic,\n\n2:44:26.580 --> 2:44:29.280\n born in a certain place, right?\n\n2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:33.080\n But those of us that have the ability to go back\n\n2:44:33.080 --> 2:44:38.040\n and reinterpret our past and use that to change the future\n\n2:44:38.040 --> 2:44:42.040\n are the ones that exert most agency in the present,\n\n2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:47.040\n and I want to achieve higher degrees of agency\n\n2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:49.280\n and enable everyone else to do that as well,\n\n2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:51.960\n to have more fun in the universe.\n\n2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:54.400\n Then we'll hit that peak, the maximum fun point.\n\n2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:56.520\n I don't think there's ever gonna be a maximum,\n\n2:44:56.520 --> 2:44:58.800\n I think the wonderful thing about the future\n\n2:44:58.800 --> 2:45:00.420\n is there's always gonna be more fun.\n\n2:45:00.420 --> 2:45:04.720\n Yeah, you, I think, again, going back to Twitter,\n\n2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:06.920\n I think you, Lee, tweeted something\n\n2:45:06.920 --> 2:45:08.520\n about being a life maximalist,\n\n2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:10.880\n that you want to maximize the number of life,\n\n2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:13.560\n the amount of life in the universe, so,\n\n2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:18.480\n and that's the more general version of that goal,\n\n2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:20.440\n is to maximize the amount of fun in the universe,\n\n2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:23.080\n because life is a subset of fun, there are all kinds of,\n\n2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:25.960\n I suppose they're either correlated or exactly equal,\n\n2:45:25.960 --> 2:45:27.000\n I don't know.\n\n2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:28.760\n Anyway, speaking of fun,\n\n2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:30.980\n let me ask you about alien sightings.\n\n2:45:32.260 --> 2:45:34.320\n So there's been quite a bit of UFO sightings\n\n2:45:34.320 --> 2:45:36.160\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:45:36.160 --> 2:45:41.160\n What do you think would be the first time\n\n2:45:41.540 --> 2:45:45.220\n when humans sight aliens, see aliens,\n\n2:45:45.220 --> 2:45:48.300\n in a sort of unquestionable way?\n\n2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:52.680\n This extremely strong and arguable way\n\n2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:56.980\n we've made contact with aliens.\n\n2:45:56.980 --> 2:45:59.040\n Sarah, what would it look like?\n\n2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:03.080\n Obviously, the space of possibilities is huge here,\n\n2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:06.240\n but if you were to kind of look into the future,\n\n2:46:06.240 --> 2:46:07.200\n what would that look like?\n\n2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:10.280\n Would it be inklings of UFOs here and there\n\n2:46:10.280 --> 2:46:13.600\n that slowly unravel a mystery?\n\n2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:18.600\n Or would it be like an obvious, overwhelming signal?\n\n2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:20.800\n So I think we have an obsession\n\n2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:23.120\n with making contact with events.\n\n2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:26.520\n So what do I mean by that is,\n\n2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:29.080\n like people have a UFO sighting, they make contact.\n\n2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:32.480\n And I always think, you know,\n\n2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:36.680\n what's interesting to me about the UFO narratives right now\n\n2:46:36.680 --> 2:46:38.160\n is not that I have a disbelief\n\n2:46:38.160 --> 2:46:40.640\n about what people are experiencing or feeling,\n\n2:46:40.640 --> 2:46:42.240\n but like the discussion right now\n\n2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:45.160\n is sort of at the level of modern mythology.\n\n2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:48.720\n Aliens are our mythos in modern culture.\n\n2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:50.460\n And when you treat it like that,\n\n2:46:50.460 --> 2:46:54.180\n then I wanna think about when do things\n\n2:46:54.180 --> 2:46:57.960\n that we traditionally only regularize through mythology\n\n2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:00.240\n actually become things that become standard knowledge?\n\n2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:02.800\n So, you know, like it used to be, you know,\n\n2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:04.560\n variations in the climate were described\n\n2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:05.840\n by some kind of gods or something.\n\n2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:06.840\n And now it's like, you know,\n\n2:47:06.840 --> 2:47:08.560\n our technology picks up an anomaly\n\n2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:11.160\n or someone sees something, we say it's aliens.\n\n2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:15.160\n And I think the real thing is it's not contact with events,\n\n2:47:15.160 --> 2:47:17.240\n but like first contact is actually contact\n\n2:47:17.240 --> 2:47:19.960\n with knowledge of the phenomenon or the explanation.\n\n2:47:19.960 --> 2:47:23.060\n And so this is very subtle and very abstract,\n\n2:47:23.060 --> 2:47:25.040\n but when does it become something\n\n2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:27.240\n that we actually understand what it is\n\n2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:28.280\n that we're talking about?\n\n2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:29.400\n That's first contact.\n\n2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:30.240\n It's not.\n\n2:47:30.240 --> 2:47:31.400\n Would you make the myth,\n\n2:47:31.400 --> 2:47:33.120\n would you give credit to the myth,\n\n2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:35.760\n the mythology as first contact?\n\n2:47:35.760 --> 2:47:36.600\n Cause you might.\n\n2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:37.420\n I think, yes.\n\n2:47:37.420 --> 2:47:38.480\n I think it's the rudimentary\n\n2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:40.800\n that we have some understanding that there's a phenomenon\n\n2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:42.920\n that we have to understand and regularize.\n\n2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:43.760\n So I think.\n\n2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:45.280\n Right, to understand that there is weather.\n\n2:47:45.280 --> 2:47:46.120\n Yes.\n\n2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:47.760\n You have to construct a pathology around that weather.\n\n2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:48.600\n Yes, yes.\n\n2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:50.800\n It's something that's controllable.\n\n2:47:50.800 --> 2:47:51.640\n Right.\n\n2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:54.940\n I see mythology basically as like baby knowledge.\n\n2:47:54.940 --> 2:47:56.380\n Right, right.\n\n2:47:56.380 --> 2:47:57.980\n It could be that, you know,\n\n2:47:57.980 --> 2:48:01.060\n although there's lots of alien sight,\n\n2:48:01.060 --> 2:48:03.180\n so called alien sightings, right?\n\n2:48:03.180 --> 2:48:04.380\n So there is a number of things you can do.\n\n2:48:04.380 --> 2:48:06.020\n You could just dismiss them and say they're not true.\n\n2:48:06.020 --> 2:48:07.460\n They're kind of made up.\n\n2:48:07.460 --> 2:48:09.740\n Or you say, well, there's something interesting here, right?\n\n2:48:09.740 --> 2:48:11.660\n We keep seeing a commonality, right?\n\n2:48:11.660 --> 2:48:14.300\n We see the same phenomenon again and again and again.\n\n2:48:14.300 --> 2:48:15.460\n Also, there's this interesting thing\n\n2:48:15.460 --> 2:48:17.320\n about human imagination.\n\n2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:20.040\n Even if they are, let's not say made up,\n\n2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:23.760\n but misappropriated kind of other inputs,\n\n2:48:23.760 --> 2:48:25.640\n the fact that human consciousness\n\n2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:29.260\n is capable of imagining a contact with aliens.\n\n2:48:29.260 --> 2:48:30.660\n Does that not tell us about something\n\n2:48:30.660 --> 2:48:32.100\n about where we are in our position,\n\n2:48:32.100 --> 2:48:33.980\n in our culture, in our technology?\n\n2:48:33.980 --> 2:48:35.380\n It tells us about where in time we are.\n\n2:48:35.380 --> 2:48:37.940\n Could it be that we're making contact with,\n\n2:48:37.940 --> 2:48:39.860\n let's say that, so let's say,\n\n2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:41.500\n let's take the most miserable version.\n\n2:48:41.500 --> 2:48:42.660\n There are no aliens in the universe.\n\n2:48:42.660 --> 2:48:44.640\n Life is only on Earth.\n\n2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:46.220\n That then, the interpretation of that\n\n2:48:46.220 --> 2:48:48.140\n is we're desperate to kind of understand\n\n2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:50.520\n why we're the only life in the universe, right?\n\n2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:51.860\n The other one is the other most extreme\n\n2:48:51.860 --> 2:48:53.380\n is that aliens are visiting all the time.\n\n2:48:53.380 --> 2:48:57.100\n We're just not able to capture them coherently,\n\n2:48:57.100 --> 2:48:59.940\n or there's a big conspiracy and there's Area 51\n\n2:48:59.940 --> 2:49:03.060\n and there are lizards everywhere and there's that.\n\n2:49:04.060 --> 2:49:06.180\n Or I'm kind of in favor of the idea\n\n2:49:06.180 --> 2:49:08.380\n that maybe humanity is waking up to the idea\n\n2:49:08.380 --> 2:49:09.740\n that we aren't alone in the universe\n\n2:49:09.740 --> 2:49:12.100\n and we're just running the simulation\n\n2:49:12.100 --> 2:49:14.660\n and we're seeing some evidence.\n\n2:49:14.660 --> 2:49:17.020\n We don't know what life is yet.\n\n2:49:17.020 --> 2:49:19.740\n We do have some anomalies out there.\n\n2:49:19.740 --> 2:49:21.240\n We can't explain everything.\n\n2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:26.240\n And over time, you know, we will start to unpack that.\n\n2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:30.920\n One very plausible thing we might do,\n\n2:49:30.920 --> 2:49:35.920\n which might be boring for the average alien observer\n\n2:49:35.920 --> 2:49:37.400\n or believes that aliens are,\n\n2:49:37.400 --> 2:49:39.640\n as in intelligent aliens are visiting Earth,\n\n2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:42.680\n it could be that we might go to the outer solar system\n\n2:49:42.680 --> 2:49:44.400\n and find a new type of life\n\n2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:46.600\n that has completely new chemistry,\n\n2:49:46.600 --> 2:49:48.560\n bring these cells back to Earth,\n\n2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:49.880\n where you could say in my hand,\n\n2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:52.840\n on Earth, here's RNA, DNA, and proteins,\n\n2:49:52.840 --> 2:49:54.900\n and look, cells self replicate.\n\n2:49:54.900 --> 2:49:57.440\n From Titan, we got this new set of molecules,\n\n2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:01.340\n new set of cells, and we feed it stuff and it grows.\n\n2:50:01.340 --> 2:50:04.000\n That for me, if we were able to do that,\n\n2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:07.560\n which would be like the most,\n\n2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:09.120\n that would be my UFO sign.\n\n2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:10.000\n That's a good test.\n\n2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.560\n So you feed it and it grows.\n\n2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:13.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:18.400\n We've made, so not until you know how to feed the thing,\n\n2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:22.680\n it grows somehow.\n\n2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:23.800\n We can make a comic book, you know,\n\n2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:26.400\n the tiger that came for tea, the alien that came for tea.\n\n2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:30.760\n What would you say is between the two of you\n\n2:50:30.760 --> 2:50:34.920\n is the biggest disagreement about alien life out there?\n\n2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:39.160\n Is it from the basic framework of thinking about\n\n2:50:39.160 --> 2:50:41.960\n what is life to maybe what aliens look like\n\n2:50:41.960 --> 2:50:45.840\n to alien civilizations, to UFO sightings?\n\n2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:47.360\n What would you think?\n\n2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:50.040\n So I would say the biggest one is that\n\n2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:53.340\n the emergence of life does not have to be,\n\n2:50:55.040 --> 2:50:57.480\n that it can't just happen once on the planet,\n\n2:50:57.480 --> 2:50:59.480\n that it could be two or more life forms\n\n2:50:59.480 --> 2:51:01.360\n present on the planet at once.\n\n2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:03.520\n And I think Sarah doesn't agree with that.\n\n2:51:03.520 --> 2:51:07.680\n I think that's like logically inconsistent.\n\n2:51:07.680 --> 2:51:08.600\n That's really polite.\n\n2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:10.560\n You're saying it's nonsense.\n\n2:51:10.560 --> 2:51:11.400\n Because you think that, yeah.\n\n2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:12.880\n So likely is that, so the idea that,\n\n2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:14.720\n what does it look like?\n\n2:51:14.720 --> 2:51:18.160\n Let's imagine two alien civilizations\n\n2:51:18.160 --> 2:51:19.480\n coexisting on a planet.\n\n2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:21.240\n What's that look like exactly?\n\n2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:26.240\n So I would say, I think I've got to get around your argument.\n\n2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:28.480\n Yeah, let's say that on this planet,\n\n2:51:28.480 --> 2:51:31.760\n there's just like, there's lots of available chemistry\n\n2:51:31.760 --> 2:51:35.600\n and one life form gets some emerges based on carbon\n\n2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:38.720\n and interacts and there's an ecosystem based on carbon.\n\n2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:43.440\n And there's an orthogonal, and so it's planetary phenomena,\n\n2:51:43.440 --> 2:51:45.200\n which is what you, I think, right?\n\n2:51:45.200 --> 2:51:47.600\n But there's also one that carries on silicon.\n\n2:51:47.600 --> 2:51:52.140\n And because there's enough energy and there's enough stuff,\n\n2:51:52.140 --> 2:51:54.360\n that these life forms might not actually\n\n2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:58.000\n necessarily compete evolutionarily.\n\n2:51:58.000 --> 2:51:59.880\n Yeah, but they would have to not interact at all\n\n2:51:59.880 --> 2:52:01.480\n because they're going to be co constructing\n\n2:52:01.480 --> 2:52:02.720\n each other's causal chains.\n\n2:52:02.720 --> 2:52:04.000\n I think that's what you just got me, yeah.\n\n2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:09.000\n So there's no overlap in terms of their causal chains\n\n2:52:09.200 --> 2:52:10.240\n or a very limited overlap.\n\n2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:12.080\n Yeah, so I think the only way I can get away with that\n\n2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:15.400\n is to say, right, life can emerge on a planet underneath.\n\n2:52:15.400 --> 2:52:16.240\n And, okay.\n\n2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:18.680\n The lizard people under the crust of the earth.\n\n2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:21.200\n I think, I think, I think we, let's go to,\n\n2:52:21.200 --> 2:52:24.400\n I think, but look, as you can see, we disagree.\n\n2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:27.020\n So, and I think Sarah actually has convinced me\n\n2:52:27.020 --> 2:52:30.240\n because of the life is a planetary,\n\n2:52:30.240 --> 2:52:32.260\n the emergence of life is a planetary phenomena.\n\n2:52:32.260 --> 2:52:36.880\n And actually, because of the way evolution selection works,\n\n2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:38.180\n then nothing occurs in isolation.\n\n2:52:38.180 --> 2:52:39.360\n The causal chains interact.\n\n2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:41.640\n So there is a common, there's a consensus model\n\n2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:42.560\n for life on the earth.\n\n2:52:42.560 --> 2:52:47.160\n But you don't think you can place aliens from elsewhere\n\n2:52:47.160 --> 2:52:51.480\n onto the, can't you just place multiple alien civilizations\n\n2:52:51.480 --> 2:52:52.320\n on one planet?\n\n2:52:52.320 --> 2:52:56.840\n Right, but I think, so you can take two origin life events\n\n2:52:56.840 --> 2:52:59.080\n that were independent and co mingle them.\n\n2:52:59.080 --> 2:53:03.920\n But I don't think when you're talking about, when you,\n\n2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:06.040\n when you look at the interaction of that structure,\n\n2:53:06.040 --> 2:53:10.100\n it's like the same idea as like an experiment\n\n2:53:10.100 --> 2:53:11.520\n being an example of life, right?\n\n2:53:11.520 --> 2:53:13.760\n That's a really abstract and subtle concept.\n\n2:53:13.760 --> 2:53:16.920\n And I guess what I'm saying is life is information\n\n2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:18.240\n propagating through matter.\n\n2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:21.200\n So once you start having things interacting,\n\n2:53:21.200 --> 2:53:24.200\n they in some sense co mingle and they become part\n\n2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:27.000\n of the same chain.\n\n2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:30.680\n So the co mingling starts quickly, proceeds,\n\n2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:32.360\n we proceed to co mingle quickly.\n\n2:53:32.360 --> 2:53:36.560\n Right, right, so you could say, so the question is then,\n\n2:53:36.560 --> 2:53:37.920\n the more interesting question is,\n\n2:53:37.920 --> 2:53:39.840\n are there two distinct origins events?\n\n2:53:39.840 --> 2:53:41.840\n And I still think that there's reasons that\n\n2:53:41.840 --> 2:53:44.700\n on a single planet, you would have one origins event\n\n2:53:44.700 --> 2:53:49.000\n because of the timescales of cycling of geochemistry\n\n2:53:49.000 --> 2:53:51.140\n on a planet and also the fact that I don't think\n\n2:53:51.140 --> 2:53:53.320\n that the origin of life happens in a pool\n\n2:53:53.320 --> 2:53:56.060\n and like radiates outward through evolutionary processes.\n\n2:53:56.060 --> 2:53:58.160\n I think it's a multi scale phenomenon happens\n\n2:53:58.160 --> 2:54:00.520\n at the level of individual molecules interacting,\n\n2:54:00.520 --> 2:54:02.120\n collections of molecules interacting\n\n2:54:02.120 --> 2:54:04.160\n and entire planetary scale cycles.\n\n2:54:04.160 --> 2:54:07.960\n So life as we know it has always been multi scale\n\n2:54:07.960 --> 2:54:11.600\n and there's brilliant examples of individual mutations\n\n2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:14.380\n at the genome level changing global climate, right?\n\n2:54:14.380 --> 2:54:17.920\n So there's a tight coupling between things that happen\n\n2:54:17.920 --> 2:54:21.840\n at the largest scale, our planetary scale\n\n2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:24.200\n and the smallest scale that life mediates.\n\n2:54:24.200 --> 2:54:26.720\n But it still might be difficult within something\n\n2:54:26.720 --> 2:54:29.720\n you would call as a single alien civilization.\n\n2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:31.920\n You know, there's species and stuff.\n\n2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:34.320\n And they might not be able to communicate.\n\n2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:36.880\n But you're asking about life, not species, right?\n\n2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:41.880\n What's the difference between one living civilization?\n\n2:54:43.080 --> 2:54:45.960\n This is almost like a category question.\n\n2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:49.080\n Versus species, because it can be very different.\n\n2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:53.200\n Because there's like literally islands\n\n2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:55.680\n that you can evolve different kinds of turtles and stuff.\n\n2:54:55.680 --> 2:54:57.120\n And they can.\n\n2:54:57.120 --> 2:54:59.240\n So I guess what I'm saying is weird.\n\n2:54:59.240 --> 2:55:00.520\n If you look at the structure\n\n2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:05.440\n of two interacting living things, populations,\n\n2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:07.000\n and you look in their past\n\n2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:10.160\n and they have independent origins for their causal chain,\n\n2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:12.080\n then you would say one was alien.\n\n2:55:12.080 --> 2:55:14.920\n You know, they have different independent origins events.\n\n2:55:14.920 --> 2:55:15.960\n But if you look at their future\n\n2:55:15.960 --> 2:55:18.200\n by virtue of the fact they're interacting,\n\n2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:20.160\n their causal chains have become commingled.\n\n2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:24.500\n So then in the future, they are not independent.\n\n2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:28.480\n So that's why you would even define them as alien.\n\n2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:32.520\n So the structure across time is two examples of life\n\n2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:33.720\n become one example of life\n\n2:55:33.720 --> 2:55:36.320\n because life is the entire structure across time.\n\n2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:39.320\n Right, but there could be a lot of variation within.\n\n2:55:39.320 --> 2:55:41.160\n Yeah, so the question we're all interested in\n\n2:55:41.160 --> 2:55:44.240\n is how many independent origins\n\n2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:48.920\n of a complexifying causal chain are there in the universe?\n\n2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:53.920\n See, but the idea of origin is easy for you to define?\n\n2:55:55.160 --> 2:55:58.760\n Because like, when the species split\n\n2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:00.640\n in the evolutionary process,\n\n2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:05.640\n and you get like a dolphin versus a human\n\n2:56:06.280 --> 2:56:10.520\n or a Neanderthal versus Homo sapiens, isn't there?\n\n2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:12.880\n Let me make a distinction here quickly.\n\n2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:16.160\n So I think, sorry to interrupt.\n\n2:56:16.160 --> 2:56:20.080\n What we're saying, I mean, Sarah won that argument\n\n2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:21.200\n because I think she's right,\n\n2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:24.400\n that once the causal chains interact and going forward,\n\n2:56:24.400 --> 2:56:25.800\n so we're talking about a number of things.\n\n2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:27.720\n Let's go all the way back before origin of life.\n\n2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:28.600\n Origin of life.\n\n2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:29.440\n On Earth.\n\n2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:30.360\n On Earth.\n\n2:56:30.360 --> 2:56:32.640\n Chemistry emerges, so there's all these,\n\n2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:35.400\n I would say there's probably mechanistically,\n\n2:56:35.400 --> 2:56:37.040\n the chemistry is desperately trying to find any way\n\n2:56:37.040 --> 2:56:38.440\n to get replicators.\n\n2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:41.600\n The ribosome kind of was really rubbish at the beginning\n\n2:56:41.600 --> 2:56:42.920\n and they just competed, competed, competed,\n\n2:56:42.920 --> 2:56:44.040\n and you got better and better ribosome.\n\n2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:46.280\n Suddenly that was a technology.\n\n2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:48.880\n The ribosome is the technology that, boom,\n\n2:56:48.880 --> 2:56:51.520\n allowed evolution to start.\n\n2:56:51.520 --> 2:56:53.960\n So what I was trying to, why I interrupted you,\n\n2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:55.960\n is say that once evolution has started\n\n2:56:55.960 --> 2:57:00.240\n using that technology, then you can speciate.\n\n2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:03.160\n And I was trying to, and I think what Sarah said\n\n2:57:03.160 --> 2:57:05.560\n was, convinced me of, because I was like, no,\n\n2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:06.840\n we're gonna have lots of different chemistry,\n\n2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:09.600\n shadow biosphere on Earth, and she's like, no, no, no.\n\n2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:11.960\n You have to have this, you have to get to this\n\n2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:16.280\n minimum evolutionary machine.\n\n2:57:16.280 --> 2:57:18.440\n And then when that occurs, speciation occurs.\n\n2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:21.360\n Exactly what it's like, dolphins, humans,\n\n2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:22.640\n everything on Earth.\n\n2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:26.160\n But when you're looking at aliens or alien life,\n\n2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:28.800\n there's not gonna be two different types of chemistry\n\n2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:31.720\n because they compete and interact and cooperate\n\n2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:33.200\n because the causal chains overlap.\n\n2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:35.480\n One might kill the other, one might combine with the other,\n\n2:57:35.480 --> 2:57:40.000\n and then you go on and then you have this average.\n\n2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:42.000\n And sure, there might be respeciation.\n\n2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:44.520\n It might have two types of emerging chemistry.\n\n2:57:44.520 --> 2:57:46.760\n It almost looks like the origin of life on Earth\n\n2:57:46.760 --> 2:57:50.120\n required two different prelife forms,\n\n2:57:50.120 --> 2:57:52.380\n the peptide world and the RNA world.\n\n2:57:52.380 --> 2:57:55.600\n Somehow they got together, and by combining,\n\n2:57:55.600 --> 2:57:56.720\n you got the ribosome.\n\n2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:00.200\n And that was the minimum competent entity for evolution.\n\n2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:03.060\n And would all alien civilizations\n\n2:58:03.060 --> 2:58:06.800\n have an evolutionary process on a planet?\n\n2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:10.480\n So it's almost the definition of life.\n\n2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:14.120\n To create all those memories, you have to have something.\n\n2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:15.800\n Things have to change in time.\n\n2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:17.600\n But there has to be selection.\n\n2:58:19.620 --> 2:58:22.200\n That's like an efficient, there's no other way to do it.\n\n2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:25.000\n No, well, never say never, because soon as I say that.\n\n2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:26.760\n That's the part that depresses me, though,\n\n2:58:26.760 --> 2:58:29.920\n going back to the earlier discussion on violence\n\n2:58:29.920 --> 2:58:32.400\n and things, and I don't know where,\n\n2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:34.020\n somebody was tweeting about this recently,\n\n2:58:34.020 --> 2:58:37.360\n but how much death had to die.\n\n2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:38.420\n Maybe it was you.\n\n2:58:38.420 --> 2:58:39.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:39.260 --> 2:58:40.080\n Ah, yeah.\n\n2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:41.720\n So, yeah, sorry.\n\n2:58:41.720 --> 2:58:43.460\n We're talking about life.\n\n2:58:43.460 --> 2:58:44.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:44.300 --> 2:58:48.480\n And I guess a lot of murder had to occur.\n\n2:58:48.480 --> 2:58:51.720\n Right, so selection means things had to be weeded out,\n\n2:58:51.720 --> 2:58:52.680\n right, so.\n\n2:58:52.680 --> 2:58:53.920\n Well, we can celebrate that.\n\n2:58:53.920 --> 2:58:55.400\n Death makes way for a tulip.\n\n2:58:55.400 --> 2:58:58.860\n Yeah, I mean, and also one of the most interesting features\n\n2:58:58.860 --> 2:59:01.760\n of major extinction events in the history of our planet\n\n2:59:01.760 --> 2:59:05.960\n is how much novelty emerged immediately after, right?\n\n2:59:05.960 --> 2:59:08.300\n So, and of course, a lot of people make arguments\n\n2:59:08.300 --> 2:59:10.780\n we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs didn't go extinct.\n\n2:59:10.780 --> 2:59:15.600\n So, in some ways, we can attribute our existence\n\n2:59:15.600 --> 2:59:16.640\n to all of that.\n\n2:59:16.640 --> 2:59:19.320\n But I guess I was just wondering and sort of like,\n\n2:59:19.320 --> 2:59:22.720\n if I was gonna build a universe myself\n\n2:59:22.720 --> 2:59:25.040\n in the most optimistic way, would I retain that feature?\n\n2:59:25.040 --> 2:59:25.880\n But it does seem to be a universe.\n\n2:59:25.880 --> 2:59:26.840\n I think you have to.\n\n2:59:26.840 --> 2:59:28.960\n I mean, I think we're probably being\n\n2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:31.320\n over anthropomorphizing.\n\n2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:32.880\n I remember watching the blue,\n\n2:59:32.880 --> 2:59:33.880\n I think it was the blue planet,\n\n2:59:33.880 --> 2:59:35.320\n David Attenborough was showing these seals\n\n2:59:35.320 --> 2:59:36.520\n and because of climate change,\n\n2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:38.640\n some seals were falling off a cliff.\n\n2:59:38.640 --> 2:59:39.560\n And how tragic that was.\n\n2:59:39.560 --> 2:59:43.040\n I was like, I'm saying my son, that's pretty cool.\n\n2:59:43.040 --> 2:59:44.360\n Look at those ones down there.\n\n2:59:44.360 --> 2:59:46.180\n They've obviously got some kind of mutations,\n\n2:59:46.180 --> 2:59:48.040\n some and they're not doing that Darth thing.\n\n2:59:48.040 --> 2:59:51.320\n And so that poor gene will be weeded out.\n\n2:59:51.320 --> 2:59:54.800\n Of course, at the individual level, it looks tragic.\n\n2:59:54.800 --> 2:59:56.320\n And of course, as human beings have the ability\n\n2:59:56.320 --> 2:59:57.920\n to abstract and we empathize,\n\n2:59:57.920 --> 3:00:00.040\n we don't wanna cause suffering on other human beings\n\n3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:01.520\n and we should retain that.\n\n3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:03.400\n But we shouldn't look back in time\n\n3:00:03.400 --> 3:00:08.400\n and say, how many butterflies had to die?\n\n3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:10.000\n I remember making this,\n\n3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:13.280\n how many, if you think about the caterpillar\n\n3:00:13.280 --> 3:00:16.120\n become the chrysalis and then the butterfly getting out,\n\n3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:18.820\n how many, if that suffering, we call it suffering,\n\n3:00:18.820 --> 3:00:21.740\n if that process of pruning had not occurred,\n\n3:00:21.740 --> 3:00:22.940\n we have no butterflies.\n\n3:00:22.940 --> 3:00:25.360\n So none of the butterfly beauty in the world\n\n3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:26.720\n without all that pruning.\n\n3:00:26.720 --> 3:00:28.880\n So pruning is required,\n\n3:00:28.880 --> 3:00:30.280\n but we shouldn't anthropomorphize\n\n3:00:30.280 --> 3:00:32.640\n and feel sorry for the biological entities,\n\n3:00:33.600 --> 3:00:36.920\n because that seems to be a backwards way of looking at it.\n\n3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:38.880\n What we should do is project forward\n\n3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:42.600\n and maybe think about what values we have across our species\n\n3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:45.080\n and our ecosystem and our fellow human beings.\n\n3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:47.840\n You know, now that we know that animals suffer\n\n3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:51.320\n at some level, think about humane farming.\n\n3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:53.160\n When we find that plants can, in fact,\n\n3:00:53.160 --> 3:00:55.200\n are conscious and can think and have pain,\n\n3:00:55.200 --> 3:00:58.520\n then we'll do humane gardening.\n\n3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:01.160\n Until that point, we won't do it, right?\n\n3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:02.060\n I like this.\n\n3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:07.400\n Famous chemist endorses the majestic nature of murder.\n\n3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:09.340\n That's the title.\n\n3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:12.080\n I didn't say that, but any case.\n\n3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:13.880\n Well, I just inserted it.\n\n3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:14.960\n I have a hard time with it, though.\n\n3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:17.720\n I think the way you put it is kind of...\n\n3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:22.220\n But it's the reality of, it is beautiful.\n\n3:01:23.160 --> 3:01:24.520\n You know, there's an Instagram account\n\n3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:25.820\n called natureismetal,\n\n3:01:25.820 --> 3:01:29.260\n and I keep following it and unfollowing it\n\n3:01:29.260 --> 3:01:32.060\n because I can't handle it for prolonged periods of time.\n\n3:01:32.060 --> 3:01:34.520\n We evolve together, you die alone.\n\n3:01:34.520 --> 3:01:35.360\n Yeah.\n\n3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:38.420\n We evolve together, but you die alone.\n\n3:01:38.420 --> 3:01:39.700\n We live alone, too.\n\n3:01:39.700 --> 3:01:40.820\n It's the Gatsby thing.\n\n3:01:40.820 --> 3:01:41.820\n I don't know.\n\n3:01:41.820 --> 3:01:42.900\n We evolve together.\n\n3:01:42.900 --> 3:01:43.800\n Where's the together?\n\n3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:48.080\n The together is the murder and the sex, sex and murder.\n\n3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:50.540\n My romantic vision of it is to try to make me happy, Sarah,\n\n3:01:50.540 --> 3:01:51.620\n instead of sad Sarah.\n\n3:01:52.700 --> 3:01:54.540\n I talk in third person when I think very abstractly.\n\n3:01:54.540 --> 3:01:58.700\n Sorry, is, you know, like this whole,\n\n3:01:58.700 --> 3:02:01.140\n like certain things can coexist,\n\n3:02:01.140 --> 3:02:02.900\n so the universe is trying to maximize existence,\n\n3:02:02.900 --> 3:02:03.740\n but there's some things\n\n3:02:03.740 --> 3:02:08.740\n that just aren't the most productive trajectory together,\n\n3:02:09.260 --> 3:02:10.700\n but it doesn't mean that they don't exist\n\n3:02:10.700 --> 3:02:14.180\n on another timeline or another chain somewhere else.\n\n3:02:14.180 --> 3:02:16.660\n Like, and maybe you would call that, like,\n\n3:02:16.660 --> 3:02:18.260\n then some kind of multiverse or things,\n\n3:02:18.260 --> 3:02:20.740\n but what am I saying?\n\n3:02:20.740 --> 3:02:21.580\n I think you can't.\n\n3:02:21.580 --> 3:02:22.900\n I just, you can't go down a level.\n\n3:02:22.900 --> 3:02:23.740\n I'm just making stuff up.\n\n3:02:23.740 --> 3:02:24.580\n No, you're not.\n\n3:02:24.580 --> 3:02:25.400\n It makes me feel better.\n\n3:02:25.400 --> 3:02:26.740\n I don't understand.\n\n3:02:26.740 --> 3:02:27.980\n Is it logical?\n\n3:02:27.980 --> 3:02:28.820\n And we need, we need.\n\n3:02:28.820 --> 3:02:29.660\n No, I know, I know.\n\n3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:31.620\n Yeah, if you look at bacteria, if you look at virus,\n\n3:02:31.620 --> 3:02:34.980\n I mean, just the number of organisms that are constantly,\n\n3:02:34.980 --> 3:02:37.460\n like looking at bacteria, they're just dying nonstop.\n\n3:02:37.460 --> 3:02:38.580\n It's like a slaughter.\n\n3:02:38.580 --> 3:02:39.540\n Right, right.\n\n3:02:39.540 --> 3:02:41.100\n Well, and this goes back to the conversation about God.\n\n3:02:41.100 --> 3:02:42.300\n I mean, like, there's the whole thing about, like,\n\n3:02:42.300 --> 3:02:44.300\n why is the universe unable to suffering?\n\n3:02:44.300 --> 3:02:46.220\n Individuals don't exist, right?\n\n3:02:46.220 --> 3:02:48.300\n Individuals, so for this, I think,\n\n3:02:48.300 --> 3:02:51.740\n if you think about life as an entity on Earth, right?\n\n3:02:51.740 --> 3:02:53.740\n Let's just, let's just go back a second.\n\n3:02:53.740 --> 3:02:55.700\n I mean, I like to, I'll be ludicrous for a second.\n\n3:02:55.700 --> 3:02:56.540\n I don't exist.\n\n3:02:56.540 --> 3:02:57.700\n You don't exist, right?\n\n3:02:58.900 --> 3:03:00.740\n But you, but the actions you do,\n\n3:03:00.740 --> 3:03:02.540\n the product of evolution exists, right?\n\n3:03:02.540 --> 3:03:06.100\n The objects you create exist quantitatively\n\n3:03:06.100 --> 3:03:07.460\n in the real world.\n\n3:03:07.460 --> 3:03:10.260\n If you then understand life on Earth or alien life\n\n3:03:10.260 --> 3:03:13.660\n or any life in the universe as this integrated entity\n\n3:03:13.660 --> 3:03:16.020\n where you need, you need cells in your body to die.\n\n3:03:16.020 --> 3:03:18.940\n Otherwise you'd just get really big\n\n3:03:18.940 --> 3:03:20.740\n and you wouldn't be able to walk around, right?\n\n3:03:20.740 --> 3:03:22.900\n So, you know, you do.\n\n3:03:22.900 --> 3:03:24.900\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:03:24.900 --> 3:03:27.340\n So, so I think.\n\n3:03:27.340 --> 3:03:29.340\n It's the patterns that persist, not the physical things.\n\n3:03:29.340 --> 3:03:31.780\n And of course, we, you know, we have, we have,\n\n3:03:31.780 --> 3:03:34.340\n we place immense values on fellow human beings\n\n3:03:34.340 --> 3:03:37.620\n and I'm, majestic professor does like\n\n3:03:37.620 --> 3:03:39.180\n other individual human beings.\n\n3:03:39.180 --> 3:03:40.740\n Now you're talking in third person too.\n\n3:03:40.740 --> 3:03:41.780\n I know, it happens, right?\n\n3:03:41.780 --> 3:03:43.620\n So death, would you say, I mean,\n\n3:03:43.620 --> 3:03:48.060\n because you said evolution is a fundamental part of life.\n\n3:03:48.060 --> 3:03:49.940\n So death is a fundamental part of life.\n\n3:03:49.940 --> 3:03:50.780\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:51.860 --> 3:03:54.220\n It might, right now, it might not be in the future.\n\n3:03:54.220 --> 3:03:56.780\n We might hack some aspects of death\n\n3:03:56.780 --> 3:03:58.580\n because, and we'll evolve in different ways.\n\n3:03:58.580 --> 3:04:00.660\n But isn't there, I think Sarah mentioned\n\n3:04:00.660 --> 3:04:02.380\n like this life density.\n\n3:04:04.300 --> 3:04:06.100\n Is it, can't that become a problem?\n\n3:04:06.100 --> 3:04:09.420\n Like too much, too much bureaucracy,\n\n3:04:09.420 --> 3:04:11.260\n too much baggage builds up.\n\n3:04:11.260 --> 3:04:13.780\n Like you need to keep erasing stuff.\n\n3:04:13.780 --> 3:04:15.460\n I think it's okay that we dissipate.\n\n3:04:15.460 --> 3:04:16.940\n Like, I don't think of it like, like, I mean.\n\n3:04:16.940 --> 3:04:18.140\n Dissipate, yes.\n\n3:04:18.140 --> 3:04:20.500\n No, but I mean, like, like we're so fixated\n\n3:04:20.500 --> 3:04:22.980\n on ourselves as individuals and agents.\n\n3:04:22.980 --> 3:04:24.300\n And we were talking about this last night,\n\n3:04:24.300 --> 3:04:27.300\n actually over dinner, but like,\n\n3:04:27.300 --> 3:04:28.460\n you know, an individual persists\n\n3:04:28.460 --> 3:04:30.140\n for a certain amount of time,\n\n3:04:30.140 --> 3:04:31.340\n but what you want to do,\n\n3:04:31.340 --> 3:04:33.420\n like if you're really concerned with immortality\n\n3:04:33.420 --> 3:04:36.060\n is not to live indefinitely as an individual,\n\n3:04:36.060 --> 3:04:37.740\n but maximize your causal impact.\n\n3:04:37.740 --> 3:04:40.580\n So like, what are the traces of you that are left?\n\n3:04:40.580 --> 3:04:43.740\n And you're still a real, I always think of Einstein,\n\n3:04:43.740 --> 3:04:47.500\n like for a period of time, he was a real physical thing\n\n3:04:47.500 --> 3:04:48.780\n we would identify as a human.\n\n3:04:48.780 --> 3:04:50.700\n And now we just see echoes of that human\n\n3:04:50.700 --> 3:04:53.060\n in all of the ways that we talk about his,\n\n3:04:53.060 --> 3:04:54.980\n you know, causal impact are frankly great\n\n3:04:54.980 --> 3:04:56.100\n is another great example.\n\n3:04:56.100 --> 3:04:58.220\n How many Easter eggs could you leave in the future?\n\n3:04:58.220 --> 3:04:59.900\n It's like, oh, I got you.\n\n3:04:59.900 --> 3:05:01.420\n So I guess the question is,\n\n3:05:01.420 --> 3:05:04.300\n how much do you want to control the localization\n\n3:05:04.300 --> 3:05:08.300\n of certain features of say a prop,\n\n3:05:08.300 --> 3:05:11.500\n a packet of propagating information we might call person\n\n3:05:11.500 --> 3:05:12.620\n and keep them localized\n\n3:05:12.620 --> 3:05:14.420\n to one individual physical structure?\n\n3:05:14.420 --> 3:05:15.780\n Or do you want to, you know,\n\n3:05:15.780 --> 3:05:18.620\n is there a time when that just becomes a dissipated feature\n\n3:05:18.620 --> 3:05:22.020\n of the society that it once existed in?\n\n3:05:22.020 --> 3:05:23.380\n And I'm okay with the dissipated feature\n\n3:05:23.380 --> 3:05:25.680\n because I just think that makes more room\n\n3:05:25.680 --> 3:05:28.180\n for more creativity in the future.\n\n3:05:28.180 --> 3:05:31.520\n So you mentioned engineering life in the lab.\n\n3:05:32.420 --> 3:05:34.680\n Let me take you to computer science world.\n\n3:05:35.860 --> 3:05:38.000\n What about robots?\n\n3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:42.540\n So is it possible to engineer,\n\n3:05:42.540 --> 3:05:47.540\n so you're really talking about like engineering life\n\n3:05:47.780 --> 3:05:49.900\n at the chemistry level,\n\n3:05:49.900 --> 3:05:53.500\n but do you think it's possible to engineer a life\n\n3:05:53.500 --> 3:05:57.940\n at the like humanoid level, at the dog level?\n\n3:05:57.940 --> 3:06:01.160\n Like, or is that, like at which level can we instill\n\n3:06:01.160 --> 3:06:05.380\n the magic of life into inanimate stuff?\n\n3:06:05.380 --> 3:06:07.220\n No, I think you could do it at every level.\n\n3:06:07.220 --> 3:06:09.060\n I just think that we're particularly interested\n\n3:06:09.060 --> 3:06:14.060\n in chemistry because it's the origin of life transition\n\n3:06:14.540 --> 3:06:16.540\n that presumably, or at least that's how I feel about it,\n\n3:06:16.540 --> 3:06:20.260\n it's going to give you the most interesting\n\n3:06:20.260 --> 3:06:22.640\n or deepest insights into the physics.\n\n3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:25.780\n But presumably everything that we do and build\n\n3:06:25.780 --> 3:06:26.780\n is an example of life.\n\n3:06:26.780 --> 3:06:29.180\n And the question is just how much do you want to take\n\n3:06:29.180 --> 3:06:31.840\n from things that we have now and put them into,\n\n3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:35.340\n like examples of life and copy them into machines?\n\n3:06:35.340 --> 3:06:38.740\n I saw that there was this tweet again.\n\n3:06:38.740 --> 3:06:40.100\n I think you were at the Mars conference\n\n3:06:40.100 --> 3:06:41.940\n and you were hanging out with a humanoid robot.\n\n3:06:41.940 --> 3:06:43.860\n Yes, that was a fun time.\n\n3:06:43.860 --> 3:06:46.820\n Making lots of new friends at Mars 2020.\n\n3:06:46.820 --> 3:06:49.700\n Did you guys color match ahead of time with the robot\n\n3:06:49.700 --> 3:06:52.060\n or did that accidentally happen?\n\n3:06:52.060 --> 3:06:54.260\n Accidentally, I went up and I wanted to say hi.\n\n3:06:54.260 --> 3:06:57.300\n Torpoise, would that be the correct name for the color?\n\n3:06:57.300 --> 3:06:58.300\n I think so.\n\n3:06:58.300 --> 3:07:00.780\n We didn't color coordinate our outfits.\n\n3:07:00.780 --> 3:07:02.740\n Well, you didn't, maybe the robot did.\n\n3:07:02.740 --> 3:07:05.260\n The robot probably did, much more stylish.\n\n3:07:05.260 --> 3:07:06.580\n So for people who are just listening,\n\n3:07:06.580 --> 3:07:09.740\n there's a picture of Sarah standing next\n\n3:07:09.740 --> 3:07:10.980\n to a humanoid robot.\n\n3:07:10.980 --> 3:07:14.860\n I guess you like them with a small head and perfect vision.\n\n3:07:14.860 --> 3:07:16.580\n Actually, no, I just.\n\n3:07:16.580 --> 3:07:19.620\n What did they perfectly, there's a LIDAR.\n\n3:07:19.620 --> 3:07:21.820\n No, I mean, I think I was just deeply interested\n\n3:07:21.820 --> 3:07:22.660\n because.\n\n3:07:22.660 --> 3:07:25.020\n What was, sorry to interrupt, was it manual control?\n\n3:07:25.020 --> 3:07:27.340\n Was it actually stabilizing itself?\n\n3:07:27.340 --> 3:07:29.020\n Oh no, it was walking around.\n\n3:07:29.020 --> 3:07:29.900\n Oh, nice.\n\n3:07:29.900 --> 3:07:30.740\n Yeah.\n\n3:07:30.740 --> 3:07:31.560\n Nice.\n\n3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:32.580\n It was pretty impressive.\n\n3:07:32.580 --> 3:07:34.380\n I mean, actually there's some videos online\n\n3:07:34.380 --> 3:07:36.100\n of Jeff Bezos walking with one of those\n\n3:07:36.100 --> 3:07:38.420\n across the lawn nearby there.\n\n3:07:38.420 --> 3:07:39.260\n This is great.\n\n3:07:39.260 --> 3:07:41.340\n Yeah.\n\n3:07:41.340 --> 3:07:42.180\n So.\n\n3:07:42.180 --> 3:07:42.980\n I wasn't invited.\n\n3:07:47.100 --> 3:07:50.620\n Yeah, but there you go.\n\n3:07:50.620 --> 3:07:51.940\n See?\n\n3:07:51.940 --> 3:07:53.180\n That's incredible, isn't it?\n\n3:07:53.180 --> 3:07:54.020\n Yeah.\n\n3:07:54.020 --> 3:07:55.980\n See, you look at the walking robot.\n\n3:07:55.980 --> 3:07:57.780\n Where did the idea for walking come from?\n\n3:07:57.780 --> 3:07:59.940\n It was invented by evolution, right?\n\n3:07:59.940 --> 3:08:02.620\n And us as human beings, able to conceptualize and design\n\n3:08:02.620 --> 3:08:04.300\n and engineer the causal change.\n\n3:08:04.300 --> 3:08:07.100\n So that robot is evidence of life.\n\n3:08:07.100 --> 3:08:11.140\n And so I think what's going to happen is there's the,\n\n3:08:11.140 --> 3:08:14.620\n we want to find where the spark comes from mechanistically.\n\n3:08:14.620 --> 3:08:17.780\n How can you literally go from sand to cells?\n\n3:08:17.780 --> 3:08:19.780\n So that's the first transition that I think,\n\n3:08:19.780 --> 3:08:21.420\n there are a number of problems we want to do.\n\n3:08:21.420 --> 3:08:22.500\n Make life in the lab.\n\n3:08:23.540 --> 3:08:24.380\n Great.\n\n3:08:24.380 --> 3:08:25.380\n Then we want to make life in the lab\n\n3:08:25.380 --> 3:08:28.220\n and want to suddenly start to make intelligent life\n\n3:08:28.220 --> 3:08:31.500\n or life that can solve, start to solve abstract problems.\n\n3:08:31.500 --> 3:08:35.260\n And then we want to make life that is conscious.\n\n3:08:35.260 --> 3:08:36.100\n Okay?\n\n3:08:36.100 --> 3:08:36.980\n In that order?\n\n3:08:36.980 --> 3:08:39.420\n I think it has to happen in that order.\n\n3:08:39.420 --> 3:08:41.620\n Getting towards this artificial general intelligence.\n\n3:08:41.620 --> 3:08:44.260\n I think that artificial general intelligence\n\n3:08:44.260 --> 3:08:45.900\n can't exist in a vacuum.\n\n3:08:45.900 --> 3:08:47.020\n It has to have a causal change\n\n3:08:47.020 --> 3:08:48.900\n all the way back to Luca, right?\n\n3:08:48.900 --> 3:08:49.740\n Yeah.\n\n3:08:49.740 --> 3:08:50.900\n And so the question I think,\n\n3:08:50.900 --> 3:08:52.900\n I really like the question is to say,\n\n3:08:52.900 --> 3:08:54.980\n what are we, how is,\n\n3:08:55.940 --> 3:08:59.180\n how is our pursuit of more and more lifelike?\n\n3:08:59.180 --> 3:09:00.980\n I know you want to, you like your robots.\n\n3:09:00.980 --> 3:09:02.020\n You want to project into them.\n\n3:09:02.020 --> 3:09:03.660\n You want to interact with them.\n\n3:09:03.660 --> 3:09:05.420\n I think you would want,\n\n3:09:05.420 --> 3:09:07.140\n if you have a robot dog and the robot dog\n\n3:09:07.140 --> 3:09:08.500\n does everything expected of a normal dog\n\n3:09:08.500 --> 3:09:10.020\n and you can't tell the difference,\n\n3:09:10.020 --> 3:09:11.740\n you're not really going to ask the question anymore.\n\n3:09:11.740 --> 3:09:12.900\n If it's a real dog or not,\n\n3:09:12.900 --> 3:09:15.980\n or you've got a personality, you're interacting with it.\n\n3:09:15.980 --> 3:09:17.460\n And so I think what would be interesting\n\n3:09:17.460 --> 3:09:20.260\n would be to kind of understand\n\n3:09:20.260 --> 3:09:22.500\n the computational architecture, how that evolves.\n\n3:09:22.500 --> 3:09:23.700\n Cause you could then, you know,\n\n3:09:23.700 --> 3:09:26.540\n teleport the personality from one object to the other\n\n3:09:26.540 --> 3:09:28.500\n and say, right, does it act the same?\n\n3:09:28.500 --> 3:09:31.260\n And I think that as we go along,\n\n3:09:31.260 --> 3:09:32.860\n we're going to get better and better\n\n3:09:32.860 --> 3:09:37.860\n at integrating our consciousness into machines.\n\n3:09:38.100 --> 3:09:41.500\n Well, let me ask you that question just to link on it.\n\n3:09:42.380 --> 3:09:45.540\n I would, I would call that a living conscious thing\n\n3:09:45.540 --> 3:09:48.900\n potentially, I as a human allegedly,\n\n3:09:48.900 --> 3:09:53.660\n but would you, as a person trying to define life,\n\n3:09:53.660 --> 3:09:56.900\n if you pass the Turing test, are you a life form?\n\n3:09:56.900 --> 3:09:58.580\n One of the reasons I walked up to the robot\n\n3:09:58.580 --> 3:10:02.900\n was because I wanted to meet the robot, right?\n\n3:10:02.900 --> 3:10:07.100\n So I, it felt like I was,\n\n3:10:07.100 --> 3:10:10.140\n and I abase a lot of my interaction with reality\n\n3:10:10.140 --> 3:10:11.260\n on emotion and feeling,\n\n3:10:11.260 --> 3:10:13.700\n but like how do you feel about an interaction?\n\n3:10:13.700 --> 3:10:14.980\n And I always love your point about like,\n\n3:10:14.980 --> 3:10:16.660\n is it enough to have that shared experience\n\n3:10:16.660 --> 3:10:17.500\n with a robot, right?\n\n3:10:17.500 --> 3:10:19.020\n So walking up to it,\n\n3:10:19.020 --> 3:10:20.940\n does it feel like you're interacting with a living thing?\n\n3:10:20.940 --> 3:10:24.340\n And it did to an extent, but in some degrees,\n\n3:10:24.340 --> 3:10:26.900\n it feels like you're interacting with a baby living thing.\n\n3:10:26.900 --> 3:10:29.300\n So I think our relationship with technology\n\n3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:31.380\n and particularly robots we build is really interesting\n\n3:10:31.380 --> 3:10:35.460\n because basically they exist as objects in our future\n\n3:10:35.460 --> 3:10:38.860\n in some sense, like we're a much older evolutionary lineage\n\n3:10:38.860 --> 3:10:42.380\n than robots are, but we're all part of the same causal chain\n\n3:10:42.380 --> 3:10:47.340\n and presumably, you know, they're kind of in their infancy.\n\n3:10:47.340 --> 3:10:49.860\n So it's almost like you're looking at the future of life\n\n3:10:49.860 --> 3:10:50.820\n when you're looking at them,\n\n3:10:50.820 --> 3:10:55.820\n but it hasn't really become life in a full manifestation\n\n3:10:56.060 --> 3:10:58.260\n of whatever it is that they're gonna become.\n\n3:10:59.700 --> 3:11:03.580\n And, you know, the example of the walking robot\n\n3:11:03.580 --> 3:11:05.980\n was super interesting, but they also had a dolphin\n\n3:11:05.980 --> 3:11:08.460\n that they put in the pool at the cocktail party at Mars,\n\n3:11:08.460 --> 3:11:11.420\n and it looked just like a real dolphin swimming in the pool.\n\n3:11:11.420 --> 3:11:14.780\n And, you know, it's in this kind of uncanny valley\n\n3:11:14.780 --> 3:11:17.180\n because, and I was having this conversation\n\n3:11:17.180 --> 3:11:21.180\n with a gentleman named Mutu who was super perceptive,\n\n3:11:21.180 --> 3:11:22.540\n but he was basically saying like,\n\n3:11:22.540 --> 3:11:24.580\n it made him feel really uncomfortable.\n\n3:11:25.780 --> 3:11:26.620\n And I think.\n\n3:11:26.620 --> 3:11:27.460\n The dolphin.\n\n3:11:27.460 --> 3:11:29.540\n Yeah, and I think a lot of people would have that response.\n\n3:11:29.540 --> 3:11:32.820\n And I guess my point about it is it is kind of interesting\n\n3:11:32.820 --> 3:11:34.740\n because you're basically trying to make a thing\n\n3:11:34.740 --> 3:11:38.340\n that you think is nonliving mimic a living thing.\n\n3:11:38.340 --> 3:11:40.860\n And so the thought experiment I would wanna run in that case\n\n3:11:40.860 --> 3:11:44.420\n is imagine we replaced every living thing on earth\n\n3:11:44.420 --> 3:11:47.100\n with a robot equivalent, like all the dolphins and things.\n\n3:11:47.100 --> 3:11:48.740\n And in some sense, then you're making,\n\n3:11:48.740 --> 3:11:51.500\n if you think that the robots aren't experiencing reality,\n\n3:11:51.500 --> 3:11:52.980\n for example, in the way that\n\n3:11:52.980 --> 3:11:54.940\n a biologically evolved thing would,\n\n3:11:54.940 --> 3:11:58.620\n you're basically making the philosophical zombie argument\n\n3:11:58.620 --> 3:12:03.620\n become real and basically building reality into a simulation\n\n3:12:03.740 --> 3:12:06.460\n because you've made everything quote unquote fake\n\n3:12:06.460 --> 3:12:07.300\n in some sense.\n\n3:12:07.300 --> 3:12:10.900\n You've replaced everything with a physical simulation of it.\n\n3:12:10.900 --> 3:12:15.020\n So as opposed to being excited by the possibility\n\n3:12:15.020 --> 3:12:17.860\n of creating something new,\n\n3:12:17.860 --> 3:12:22.420\n you're terrified of humans being replaced.\n\n3:12:22.420 --> 3:12:23.700\n I was just trying to run like what would be\n\n3:12:23.700 --> 3:12:26.180\n the absolute thought experiment.\n\n3:12:26.180 --> 3:12:29.460\n But I don't think that scenario would actually play out.\n\n3:12:29.460 --> 3:12:32.700\n I guess what I think is weird for why we feel\n\n3:12:32.700 --> 3:12:34.260\n this kind of uncanny valley interacting\n\n3:12:34.260 --> 3:12:36.420\n with something like the robot dolphin\n\n3:12:36.420 --> 3:12:38.300\n is we're looking at an object we know is kind of\n\n3:12:38.300 --> 3:12:40.100\n in the future in the sense of like\n\n3:12:40.100 --> 3:12:41.900\n if everything's ordered in time,\n\n3:12:41.900 --> 3:12:43.440\n but it's borrowing from a structure\n\n3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:45.260\n that we have common history with,\n\n3:12:45.260 --> 3:12:48.240\n and it's basically copying in a kind of superficial way\n\n3:12:48.240 --> 3:12:52.100\n things from one part of the causal chain to another.\n\n3:12:52.100 --> 3:12:53.260\n Yeah.\n\n3:12:53.260 --> 3:12:56.020\n Well, that's a video of...\n\n3:12:56.020 --> 3:12:57.640\n Everybody believed it was real.\n\n3:12:57.640 --> 3:12:59.240\n They look so real.\n\n3:13:00.560 --> 3:13:04.300\n And obviously the technology was developed for movies, so.\n\n3:13:04.300 --> 3:13:06.620\n Well, I think we're confusing our emotional response\n\n3:13:06.620 --> 3:13:08.100\n and understanding the causal chain\n\n3:13:08.100 --> 3:13:09.620\n of how we got there, right?\n\n3:13:09.620 --> 3:13:11.900\n Because the philosophical dot zombie argument\n\n3:13:11.900 --> 3:13:15.060\n thinks about objects just appearing, right,\n\n3:13:15.060 --> 3:13:16.620\n that you're facsimile in some way,\n\n3:13:16.620 --> 3:13:19.420\n whereas there is the causal, the chain of events\n\n3:13:19.420 --> 3:13:22.340\n that caused the dolphin to be built went for a human being.\n\n3:13:22.340 --> 3:13:23.740\n Yeah, would a philosophical zombie\n\n3:13:23.740 --> 3:13:25.620\n still have a high assembly index?\n\n3:13:25.620 --> 3:13:26.900\n Yeah.\n\n3:13:26.900 --> 3:13:29.740\n Because it can't be, philosophical zombies can't,\n\n3:13:29.740 --> 3:13:33.260\n like Boltzmann brains, just can't appear out of nowhere.\n\n3:13:33.260 --> 3:13:35.180\n Well, I guess my question would be in that scenario\n\n3:13:35.180 --> 3:13:36.020\n where you built all the robots\n\n3:13:36.020 --> 3:13:37.500\n and replaced everything on Earth with robots,\n\n3:13:37.500 --> 3:13:39.400\n would the biosphere be as creative\n\n3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:40.900\n under that scenario or not?\n\n3:13:40.900 --> 3:13:42.460\n Yeah, that's a good question.\n\n3:13:42.460 --> 3:13:44.380\n Are there quantitative differences\n\n3:13:44.380 --> 3:13:45.700\n you would notice over time?\n\n3:13:45.700 --> 3:13:47.340\n And it's not obvious either way, right?\n\n3:13:47.340 --> 3:13:48.460\n It's not obvious right now,\n\n3:13:48.460 --> 3:13:50.780\n because we don't really, we don't understand,\n\n3:13:50.780 --> 3:13:53.220\n we haven't built into machines how we work.\n\n3:13:53.220 --> 3:13:56.540\n So that's, I think, one of the big missing things\n\n3:13:56.540 --> 3:13:59.100\n that we're both looking for, right?\n\n3:13:59.100 --> 3:14:01.100\n This is a robot, it's a cute robot.\n\n3:14:01.100 --> 3:14:03.180\n But the point, Sarah, is that the biosphere\n\n3:14:03.180 --> 3:14:05.660\n won't be as creative if you did it right now.\n\n3:14:05.660 --> 3:14:07.820\n No, of course, I think that's why people don't like it.\n\n3:14:07.820 --> 3:14:12.740\n But in the future, we will be able to solve the problem\n\n3:14:12.740 --> 3:14:17.740\n of origin of life, intelligence, and consciousness\n\n3:14:19.380 --> 3:14:21.180\n because they exist in physical substrates.\n\n3:14:21.180 --> 3:14:22.620\n We just don't understand enough\n\n3:14:22.620 --> 3:14:26.300\n about the material substrate and the causal chain.\n\n3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:29.180\n But I'm very confident we will get to an AGI,\n\n3:14:29.180 --> 3:14:30.220\n but it won't be what people think.\n\n3:14:30.220 --> 3:14:34.040\n It won't be, solution won't be a, we'll get fooled a lot.\n\n3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:36.480\n And so GPT3 is getting better at fooling us\n\n3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:39.900\n and GPT153 might really fool us,\n\n3:14:39.900 --> 3:14:42.700\n but it won't have the magic we're looking for.\n\n3:14:42.700 --> 3:14:44.260\n It won't be a creative,\n\n3:14:45.140 --> 3:14:48.700\n but it will help us understand the differences between.\n\n3:14:48.700 --> 3:14:53.200\n Really though, because isn't that what love is, being fooled?\n\n3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:57.540\n Like what, why are you not giving much value\n\n3:14:57.540 --> 3:15:00.000\n to the emotional connection with objects,\n\n3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:01.860\n with robots, with humans?\n\n3:15:01.860 --> 3:15:03.660\n Emotion is a thing which happens\n\n3:15:03.660 --> 3:15:08.660\n when your expectation function is dashed\n\n3:15:09.220 --> 3:15:11.660\n and something else happens, right?\n\n3:15:11.660 --> 3:15:13.460\n I mean, that's what emotion is.\n\n3:15:13.460 --> 3:15:14.740\n Is that what love is too?\n\n3:15:14.740 --> 3:15:15.900\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:15.900 --> 3:15:18.780\n You were expecting one thing and something else happened.\n\n3:15:18.780 --> 3:15:19.600\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:20.440\n I don't know.\n\n3:15:20.440 --> 3:15:21.500\n I don't think that's true either.\n\n3:15:21.500 --> 3:15:22.340\n Well, what is it then?\n\n3:15:22.340 --> 3:15:25.140\n I think, no, emotion, look, I'm sorry, emotion is that,\n\n3:15:25.140 --> 3:15:25.980\n but there's no more.\n\n3:15:25.980 --> 3:15:28.340\n No, I think love is just fulfilling your purpose.\n\n3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:30.100\n No, but, okay, I mean, look, look.\n\n3:15:30.100 --> 3:15:30.940\n Like whatever that means.\n\n3:15:30.940 --> 3:15:31.780\n That's the opposite of what's gonna happen.\n\n3:15:31.780 --> 3:15:32.600\n I mean, really?\n\n3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:33.440\n So, okay.\n\n3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:34.280\n I think the happiest is like when you're doing.\n\n3:15:34.280 --> 3:15:35.120\n All right, all right, all right.\n\n3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:35.940\n Let me go back.\n\n3:15:35.940 --> 3:15:36.780\n If you want me to define.\n\n3:15:36.780 --> 3:15:37.620\n Follow your bliss.\n\n3:15:37.620 --> 3:15:38.940\n Let me define love quickly.\n\n3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:39.940\n Okay, go for it.\n\n3:15:39.940 --> 3:15:42.060\n In terms of assembly space, right?\n\n3:15:42.060 --> 3:15:42.900\n Okay?\n\n3:15:42.900 --> 3:15:43.720\n Excellent.\n\n3:15:43.720 --> 3:15:45.140\n I didn't think I'd be doing this today.\n\n3:15:45.140 --> 3:15:47.620\n I can't wait till Assembly Theory 101 is taught\n\n3:15:47.620 --> 3:15:49.980\n and the second lecture is Assembly Theory of Love.\n\n3:15:49.980 --> 3:15:51.980\n No, no, but look, actually, but look, but.\n\n3:15:53.620 --> 3:15:54.580\n It's being surprised.\n\n3:15:54.580 --> 3:15:56.180\n The expectation is being broken.\n\n3:15:56.180 --> 3:15:57.020\n I'm just, I'm not.\n\n3:15:57.020 --> 3:15:57.860\n No, go for it.\n\n3:15:57.860 --> 3:15:58.700\n I wanna hear you.\n\n3:15:58.700 --> 3:16:00.780\n I'm not an emotional being, but I would say,\n\n3:16:00.780 --> 3:16:02.780\n so let's talk, so we'll talk about emotion a bit,\n\n3:16:02.780 --> 3:16:03.980\n but love is more complex.\n\n3:16:03.980 --> 3:16:06.380\n Love is a very complex set of emotions together\n\n3:16:06.380 --> 3:16:09.540\n and logical stuff, but if you've got this thing,\n\n3:16:09.540 --> 3:16:11.700\n this person that's on this causal chain\n\n3:16:11.700 --> 3:16:14.860\n that has this empathy for this other thing,\n\n3:16:14.860 --> 3:16:18.260\n love is being able to project ahead in your assembly space\n\n3:16:18.260 --> 3:16:20.100\n and work out what you're,\n\n3:16:20.100 --> 3:16:22.620\n the person you're in love with has a need for\n\n3:16:22.620 --> 3:16:26.620\n and to do that for them without selflessly, right?\n\n3:16:26.620 --> 3:16:28.260\n Cause you can project ahead what they're gonna need\n\n3:16:28.260 --> 3:16:30.060\n and they are there and maybe you can see\n\n3:16:30.060 --> 3:16:31.540\n someone who's gonna fall over\n\n3:16:31.540 --> 3:16:33.020\n and you catch them before they fall over\n\n3:16:33.020 --> 3:16:35.540\n or maybe you can anticipate that someone's gonna be hungry\n\n3:16:35.540 --> 3:16:38.100\n and without helping you, you just help them.\n\n3:16:38.100 --> 3:16:38.940\n That's what love is.\n\n3:16:38.940 --> 3:16:40.300\n That just sounds like empathy.\n\n3:16:40.300 --> 3:16:42.020\n But it's more complex than that, right?\n\n3:16:42.020 --> 3:16:42.940\n It's more complex.\n\n3:16:42.940 --> 3:16:46.100\n It's more about not just empathy, it's understanding.\n\n3:16:46.100 --> 3:16:48.580\n It's about kind of sharing that experience.\n\n3:16:48.580 --> 3:16:49.580\n That's an expression of love though.\n\n3:16:49.580 --> 3:16:51.220\n That's not what it's like to feel love.\n\n3:16:51.220 --> 3:16:53.180\n Like feeling love is like,\n\n3:16:53.180 --> 3:16:55.740\n I think it's like when you're aligned with things\n\n3:16:55.740 --> 3:16:58.620\n that you feel like are your purpose\n\n3:16:58.620 --> 3:17:00.540\n or your reason for existing.\n\n3:17:00.540 --> 3:17:05.300\n So if you have those feelings towards a robot,\n\n3:17:05.300 --> 3:17:06.260\n why is that robot?\n\n3:17:06.260 --> 3:17:09.220\n I mean, cause you said like the AGI,\n\n3:17:09.220 --> 3:17:10.340\n we'll build an AGI,\n\n3:17:10.340 --> 3:17:12.860\n but there'll be a fundamental difference in AGI.\n\n3:17:12.860 --> 3:17:13.700\n I don't think we'll build it.\n\n3:17:13.700 --> 3:17:15.180\n It's gonna emerge from our technology.\n\n3:17:15.180 --> 3:17:17.020\n I think you guys all argue the same thing.\n\n3:17:17.020 --> 3:17:18.860\n I just said that GPT,\n\n3:17:18.860 --> 3:17:23.260\n we do not correctly capture the causal chain that we have.\n\n3:17:23.260 --> 3:17:24.700\n Within GPT.\n\n3:17:24.700 --> 3:17:25.540\n Yeah, within AI.\n\n3:17:25.540 --> 3:17:27.300\n But don't you think it captures,\n\n3:17:27.300 --> 3:17:30.220\n because GPT3 is fundamentally trained\n\n3:17:30.220 --> 3:17:33.340\n on a corpus of knowledge,\n\n3:17:34.540 --> 3:17:35.900\n like the internet.\n\n3:17:35.900 --> 3:17:38.580\n Don't you think it gets better and better and better\n\n3:17:38.580 --> 3:17:39.980\n at capturing the memory of all the...\n\n3:17:39.980 --> 3:17:42.060\n It will be better at fooling you.\n\n3:17:42.060 --> 3:17:44.420\n And at some point you won't care.\n\n3:17:44.420 --> 3:17:46.100\n But when it comes to,\n\n3:17:46.100 --> 3:17:47.260\n my guess, this is a quick,\n\n3:17:47.260 --> 3:17:49.260\n this is what I was getting to right before we got,\n\n3:17:49.260 --> 3:17:51.340\n I got in the love trap.\n\n3:17:51.340 --> 3:17:52.180\n Love trap, yeah.\n\n3:17:52.180 --> 3:17:54.660\n It was like Lee Cronin in the love trap.\n\n3:17:57.180 --> 3:17:58.860\n Sounds like a good fan name.\n\n3:17:58.860 --> 3:18:01.700\n SAD, okay, SAD, assembly space of SAD.\n\n3:18:01.700 --> 3:18:04.380\n No, is that, so sure.\n\n3:18:04.380 --> 3:18:06.380\n But I think there are other features\n\n3:18:06.380 --> 3:18:09.100\n that allow that we pull on innovation\n\n3:18:09.100 --> 3:18:12.580\n that allow us to do more than what we just see in GPT3.\n\n3:18:12.580 --> 3:18:14.300\n So if you're being fooled there.\n\n3:18:14.300 --> 3:18:16.820\n So I think what I mean is human beings have this ability\n\n3:18:16.820 --> 3:18:19.220\n to be surprising and creative.\n\n3:18:19.220 --> 3:18:22.100\n Whereas is it Dali, this thing,\n\n3:18:22.100 --> 3:18:27.100\n or if you take GPT3 is not gonna create a new verb.\n\n3:18:27.100 --> 3:18:30.220\n Shakespeare created new verbs.\n\n3:18:30.220 --> 3:18:31.740\n You're like, wow.\n\n3:18:31.740 --> 3:18:35.260\n And that required Shakespeare to think outside of language\n\n3:18:35.260 --> 3:18:36.580\n in a different domain.\n\n3:18:36.580 --> 3:18:39.900\n So I think having that connections across multiple domains\n\n3:18:39.900 --> 3:18:41.260\n is what you need for AGI.\n\n3:18:41.260 --> 3:18:43.060\n Yeah, but I don't know if you need,\n\n3:18:44.340 --> 3:18:46.660\n I don't know if there's any limitations to GPT\n\n3:18:48.380 --> 3:18:51.660\n and not being able to be across domain.\n\n3:18:51.660 --> 3:18:53.460\n The number one problem is,\n\n3:18:53.460 --> 3:18:56.460\n it's instantiated in a resource limited substrate\n\n3:18:56.460 --> 3:18:58.020\n and that we don't, in silicon.\n\n3:19:00.820 --> 3:19:03.100\n The architectures used for training, for learning\n\n3:19:03.100 --> 3:19:06.900\n is about fooling, it's not about understanding.\n\n3:19:06.900 --> 3:19:10.860\n And I think that there is some understanding that we have\n\n3:19:10.860 --> 3:19:13.740\n that is not yet symbolically representable.\n\n3:19:13.740 --> 3:19:17.020\n Language, learning language and using language\n\n3:19:17.020 --> 3:19:20.340\n seems to be fundamentally about fooling, not understanding.\n\n3:19:22.020 --> 3:19:23.900\n Why do you use language exactly?\n\n3:19:23.900 --> 3:19:27.540\n I might disagree with that quite fundamentally actually,\n\n3:19:27.540 --> 3:19:30.100\n but I'm not sure I understand\n\n3:19:30.100 --> 3:19:32.020\n how I make a coherent argument for that.\n\n3:19:32.020 --> 3:19:37.020\n But my feeling is that there is comprehension in reality\n\n3:19:39.900 --> 3:19:42.900\n in our consciousness below language.\n\n3:19:42.900 --> 3:19:45.620\n And we use those for language,\n\n3:19:45.620 --> 3:19:46.940\n for all sorts of expressions.\n\n3:19:46.940 --> 3:19:49.020\n And we don't yet understand that there's a gap.\n\n3:19:49.020 --> 3:19:51.100\n We will get there, but I'm saying,\n\n3:19:51.100 --> 3:19:52.940\n wouldn't it be interesting, it's a bit like saying,\n\n3:19:52.940 --> 3:19:57.940\n could I facsimile you or Sarah into a new human being?\n\n3:19:57.940 --> 3:20:00.420\n And let's just say, I could copy all your atoms\n\n3:20:00.420 --> 3:20:02.900\n and the positions of all your atoms and electrons\n\n3:20:02.900 --> 3:20:05.940\n into this other person, they would be you.\n\n3:20:05.940 --> 3:20:07.220\n The answer is no.\n\n3:20:07.220 --> 3:20:10.020\n And it's quite easy to show using assembly theory\n\n3:20:10.020 --> 3:20:12.260\n because actually the feature space that you have,\n\n3:20:12.260 --> 3:20:14.820\n that graph, the only way to copy you\n\n3:20:14.820 --> 3:20:16.780\n is to create you on that graph.\n\n3:20:16.780 --> 3:20:18.660\n So everything that's happened to you in your past,\n\n3:20:18.660 --> 3:20:20.220\n we have to have a faithful record for.\n\n3:20:20.220 --> 3:20:21.580\n If you want another copy of Lex,\n\n3:20:21.580 --> 3:20:22.500\n you have to do the exact thing.\n\n3:20:22.500 --> 3:20:24.660\n Want another copy of Sarah, want another copy of Lee.\n\n3:20:24.660 --> 3:20:27.340\n The exact past has to be replicated.\n\n3:20:27.340 --> 3:20:28.780\n Let me push back on that a little bit.\n\n3:20:28.780 --> 3:20:31.300\n That's maybe from an assembly theory perspective,\n\n3:20:31.300 --> 3:20:34.580\n but I don't think it's that difficult\n\n3:20:34.580 --> 3:20:37.480\n to recreate a version of me, like a clone,\n\n3:20:37.480 --> 3:20:42.400\n that would make everybody exactly equally as happy.\n\n3:20:43.380 --> 3:20:44.660\n They wouldn't care which one.\n\n3:20:44.660 --> 3:20:49.020\n And there's two of me and then they get to pick which one\n\n3:20:49.020 --> 3:20:50.900\n and they'll kill either one, they'll be fine.\n\n3:20:50.900 --> 3:20:52.340\n As long as they're forced to kill.\n\n3:20:52.340 --> 3:20:53.180\n They'll be fine.\n\n3:20:53.180 --> 3:20:54.020\n But here's what will happen is,\n\n3:20:54.020 --> 3:20:56.180\n let's say we make artificial Lex\n\n3:20:56.180 --> 3:20:57.300\n and it was like, wow, so cool.\n\n3:20:57.300 --> 3:20:58.720\n It looks the same interact.\n\n3:20:58.720 --> 3:20:59.980\n Then there'll be this battle of like,\n\n3:20:59.980 --> 3:21:01.260\n right, we're going to tell the difference.\n\n3:21:01.260 --> 3:21:04.540\n We're going to basically keep nudging Lex\n\n3:21:04.540 --> 3:21:09.260\n and artificial Lex until we get novelty from one\n\n3:21:09.260 --> 3:21:10.620\n and we'll kill the other one.\n\n3:21:10.620 --> 3:21:12.260\n And I think, thank God.\n\n3:21:12.260 --> 3:21:14.540\n We're not, novelty is a fuzzy concept.\n\n3:21:14.540 --> 3:21:16.380\n That's the whole problem of novelty.\n\n3:21:16.380 --> 3:21:18.820\n So I will define novelty, it's not fuzzy.\n\n3:21:18.820 --> 3:21:23.820\n Novelty is the ability for you to create architectures\n\n3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:28.680\n that are, or create an architecture.\n\n3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:30.740\n So let's say you've got a corpus of architectures known.\n\n3:21:30.740 --> 3:21:32.940\n You can write down, you've got some distance measure.\n\n3:21:32.940 --> 3:21:35.780\n And then I create a new one and the distance measure\n\n3:21:35.780 --> 3:21:37.740\n so far away from what you'd expected.\n\n3:21:38.940 --> 3:21:40.420\n There's no linear algebra going to get there.\n\n3:21:40.420 --> 3:21:43.940\n It's like, that is creativity.\n\n3:21:43.940 --> 3:21:47.500\n And we don't know how to do that yet on any level.\n\n3:21:47.500 --> 3:21:49.100\n Well, I was also thinking about like your argument\n\n3:21:49.100 --> 3:21:51.460\n about free will, like you wouldn't be able to know\n\n3:21:51.460 --> 3:21:53.600\n it was, it doesn't work instantaneously.\n\n3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:55.460\n It's not like a micro level thing,\n\n3:21:55.460 --> 3:21:58.060\n but more a macro level thing over the scale of trajectories\n\n3:21:58.060 --> 3:21:59.220\n or longer term decisions.\n\n3:21:59.220 --> 3:22:02.440\n So if you think that the novelty manifests\n\n3:22:02.440 --> 3:22:03.940\n over those longer timescales,\n\n3:22:03.940 --> 3:22:08.100\n it might be the two Lexes diverge quite a bit\n\n3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:11.740\n over certain timescales of their behavior.\n\n3:22:11.740 --> 3:22:15.140\n But nobody would notice the difference.\n\n3:22:15.140 --> 3:22:16.900\n They might not.\n\n3:22:16.900 --> 3:22:20.100\n And the universe, the earth won't notice the difference.\n\n3:22:20.100 --> 3:22:20.940\n The universe won't notice the difference.\n\n3:22:20.940 --> 3:22:22.580\n The universe would notice the difference.\n\n3:22:22.580 --> 3:22:24.920\n No, the universe doesn't know about its novelty\n\n3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:25.760\n that's being generated.\n\n3:22:25.760 --> 3:22:27.740\n That's the whole point of novelty.\n\n3:22:27.740 --> 3:22:29.260\n Yeah, but this is what selection is, right?\n\n3:22:29.260 --> 3:22:31.860\n It's like taking nearly equivalent ones\n\n3:22:31.860 --> 3:22:34.780\n and then deciding like the universe selects, right?\n\n3:22:34.780 --> 3:22:36.240\n So whatever selection is,\n\n3:22:36.240 --> 3:22:38.140\n select some things to persist in time.\n\n3:22:38.140 --> 3:22:40.420\n Yeah, it's gonna select the artificial one\n\n3:22:40.420 --> 3:22:42.140\n just because it likes that one better.\n\n3:22:42.140 --> 3:22:43.720\n Well, you're mixing up two arguments here.\n\n3:22:43.720 --> 3:22:45.060\n So look, let's go back a second.\n\n3:22:45.060 --> 3:22:47.260\n What are you basing this argument on, Lex?\n\n3:22:47.260 --> 3:22:50.340\n I'm just saying that I kind of don't think,\n\n3:22:50.340 --> 3:22:53.700\n cause at least said that it's not possible.\n\n3:22:53.700 --> 3:22:58.700\n Like if you copy every single molecule in a person's body,\n\n3:22:59.260 --> 3:23:01.760\n that's not going to be the same person.\n\n3:23:01.760 --> 3:23:05.300\n That they won't have the same assembly index.\n\n3:23:05.300 --> 3:23:07.220\n It won't be the same person.\n\n3:23:07.220 --> 3:23:09.900\n And I just don't, I think copying, you can compress.\n\n3:23:09.900 --> 3:23:11.920\n Not only do I disagree with that,\n\n3:23:11.920 --> 3:23:15.440\n I just, I think you can even compress a person down\n\n3:23:15.440 --> 3:23:17.920\n to some where you can fool the universe.\n\n3:23:17.920 --> 3:23:19.840\n I'm saying, let me restate it.\n\n3:23:19.840 --> 3:23:23.960\n It is not possible to copy somebody on,\n\n3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:27.000\n because you, unless you copy the causal history.\n\n3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:29.280\n Also, you can't have two identical.\n\n3:23:29.280 --> 3:23:30.800\n I mean, actually I really like the idea\n\n3:23:30.800 --> 3:23:32.040\n that everything in the universe is unique.\n\n3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:33.760\n So even if like there were two Lex's.\n\n3:23:33.760 --> 3:23:35.000\n I know you like that idea\n\n3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:37.000\n cause you're human and you think you're unique.\n\n3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:37.840\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n3:23:37.840 --> 3:23:39.560\n But also I can make a logical argument for it\n\n3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:42.280\n that even if we could copy all of your molecules\n\n3:23:42.280 --> 3:23:44.560\n and all their positions, the other you would be there.\n\n3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:47.480\n And you have a different position in space.\n\n3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:48.300\n And the other thing.\n\n3:23:48.300 --> 3:23:49.140\n You're distinguishable.\n\n3:23:49.140 --> 3:23:49.960\n Yeah, the other thing I was gonna add.\n\n3:23:49.960 --> 3:23:51.040\n How unique are you?\n\n3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:53.000\n Just by the position in space really.\n\n3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:55.960\n Sure, but then how much does that light translation\n\n3:23:55.960 --> 3:23:58.920\n of Lex sitting there affect the future?\n\n3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:02.320\n I see, but wait a minute.\n\n3:24:02.320 --> 3:24:05.580\n Is part of the definition of something being interesting\n\n3:24:05.580 --> 3:24:07.880\n is how much it affects the future?\n\n3:24:07.880 --> 3:24:08.720\n Yes.\n\n3:24:08.720 --> 3:24:09.560\n Yes.\n\n3:24:09.560 --> 3:24:10.380\n But let me come back.\n\n3:24:10.380 --> 3:24:11.220\n Don't you agree?\n\n3:24:11.220 --> 3:24:12.060\n Do you disagree?\n\n3:24:12.060 --> 3:24:12.880\n But let me come back one point quickly\n\n3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:13.720\n that you were making.\n\n3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:15.680\n Sure, I think I probably agree, yes.\n\n3:24:15.680 --> 3:24:16.600\n There's two Lex's, right?\n\n3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:18.560\n There's a robot Lex that you just basically,\n\n3:24:18.560 --> 3:24:21.080\n it is a charade.\n\n3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:22.700\n It's a facsimile.\n\n3:24:22.700 --> 3:24:26.680\n It's just coded to emulate you.\n\n3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:28.840\n Are you robot Lex?\n\n3:24:28.840 --> 3:24:30.040\n I wouldn't know, right?\n\n3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:30.860\n Let's get that.\n\n3:24:30.860 --> 3:24:31.700\n But let's get that.\n\n3:24:31.700 --> 3:24:32.540\n That's the point.\n\n3:24:32.540 --> 3:24:33.360\n It's a very important point here\n\n3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:35.440\n because he's ducking and diving between this eye.\n\n3:24:35.440 --> 3:24:38.680\n So if I facsimile you into a robot,\n\n3:24:38.680 --> 3:24:41.840\n then your robot might be,\n\n3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:43.280\n would be a representation of you now,\n\n3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:44.340\n but fundamentally be boring\n\n3:24:44.340 --> 3:24:45.640\n because you go and have other ideas.\n\n3:24:45.640 --> 3:24:47.740\n If, however, you built an architecture\n\n3:24:47.740 --> 3:24:50.120\n that itself is capable of generating novelty,\n\n3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:52.040\n you would diverge in your causal chain\n\n3:24:52.040 --> 3:24:54.960\n and you'd both be equally interesting to interact with.\n\n3:24:54.960 --> 3:24:56.360\n We don't know that mechanism.\n\n3:24:56.360 --> 3:24:58.540\n All I'm trying to say is we don't yet know that mechanism.\n\n3:24:58.540 --> 3:25:01.200\n We do not know the mechanism that generates novelty.\n\n3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:05.280\n And at the moment in our AIs, we are emulating,\n\n3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:07.280\n we are not generating.\n\n3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:09.000\n You don't think we're sneaking up on that?\n\n3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:11.960\n No, no, there is no ghost in the machine.\n\n3:25:13.640 --> 3:25:15.200\n And I want there to be one.\n\n3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:16.440\n I want the same thing you want.\n\n3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:17.260\n Sorry, I was.\n\n3:25:17.260 --> 3:25:18.360\n I know you want that as a human\n\n3:25:18.360 --> 3:25:20.760\n because everything you just said\n\n3:25:20.760 --> 3:25:22.240\n makes you feel more special.\n\n3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:24.440\n I want to be, no, no, no, screw my specialness.\n\n3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:26.100\n I just want to be surprised.\n\n3:25:26.100 --> 3:25:26.940\n If I.\n\n3:25:26.940 --> 3:25:28.280\n You don't think a robot can surprise you.\n\n3:25:28.280 --> 3:25:30.600\n If I, if you can produce an algorithm\n\n3:25:30.600 --> 3:25:32.760\n instantiated in a robot to surprise me,\n\n3:25:32.760 --> 3:25:35.360\n I will, I will, I will, I will,\n\n3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:37.520\n I will have one of those robots, it'll be brilliant.\n\n3:25:37.520 --> 3:25:39.920\n But they won't, it won't surprise me.\n\n3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:41.560\n But why, why is it a problem\n\n3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:44.360\n to think that humans are special?\n\n3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:45.880\n Maybe it's not the special, you're right.\n\n3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:47.800\n It's the better than.\n\n3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:48.640\n Yes.\n\n3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:51.460\n Because then you start to not recognize\n\n3:25:51.460 --> 3:25:53.320\n the magic in other life forms\n\n3:25:53.320 --> 3:25:56.320\n that you either have created or you have observed.\n\n3:25:56.320 --> 3:25:58.160\n Because I just think there is magic\n\n3:25:58.160 --> 3:26:01.720\n in legged robots moving about.\n\n3:26:01.720 --> 3:26:03.400\n And they are full of surprises.\n\n3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:04.220\n Yeah.\n\n3:26:04.220 --> 3:26:05.060\n So this is.\n\n3:26:05.060 --> 3:26:06.000\n And functionality.\n\n3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:07.040\n Yeah.\n\n3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:08.400\n So I'm a little.\n\n3:26:09.560 --> 3:26:11.640\n I know why you like cellular automata, right?\n\n3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:14.480\n But the specialness in your robot\n\n3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:17.680\n comes from the roboticist that built it.\n\n3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:20.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:21.120\n It's part of the lineage.\n\n3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:21.960\n Yeah.\n\n3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:22.780\n And so that's fine.\n\n3:26:22.780 --> 3:26:23.620\n I'm happy with that.\n\n3:26:23.620 --> 3:26:25.280\n That's what I felt like looking at the standing robot\n\n3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:27.160\n was I was looking at four billion years of evolution.\n\n3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:28.000\n Yeah. Right.\n\n3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:28.840\n If it wasn't.\n\n3:26:28.840 --> 3:26:29.760\n So I think I'm happy.\n\n3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:31.800\n I mean, I'm happy we're gonna coexist.\n\n3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:33.560\n I'm just saying you're gonna get more excitement.\n\n3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:34.400\n There's something missing\n\n3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:36.000\n in our understanding of intelligence.\n\n3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:38.360\n Intelligence isn't just training.\n\n3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:41.560\n The way the neural network is conceived right now is great\n\n3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:43.040\n and it's lovely and it'll be better\n\n3:26:43.040 --> 3:26:44.080\n and we will argue forever.\n\n3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:47.440\n But you want to know, wouldn't it be great if I said,\n\n3:26:47.440 --> 3:26:49.620\n look, I know how to invent an architecture\n\n3:26:49.620 --> 3:26:51.520\n and I can give it a soul.\n\n3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:54.400\n And what I mean by a soul is some,\n\n3:26:54.400 --> 3:26:58.800\n I know for real that there is internal reference.\n\n3:26:58.800 --> 3:27:00.960\n Soon as I not fake internal reference.\n\n3:27:00.960 --> 3:27:02.600\n And if we could generate that mechanism\n\n3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:04.680\n for internal reference, that's why our goal direct.\n\n3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:07.200\n That's why you have to develop a test for goal directness.\n\n3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:08.240\n Get that goal directness.\n\n3:27:08.240 --> 3:27:09.840\n You would love that robot more than the one\n\n3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:12.960\n that's just made to look like it does\n\n3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:14.280\n because you'll have more fun with it\n\n3:27:14.280 --> 3:27:17.840\n because you better generate search, other problems,\n\n3:27:17.840 --> 3:27:18.680\n get to more novelty.\n\n3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:21.440\n Hell, you'd be able to fall in love with that robot for real,\n\n3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:23.080\n but not the one that's faking it.\n\n3:27:24.620 --> 3:27:26.600\n What about fake it till you make it?\n\n3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:31.600\n Well, I think a lot of people fall in love with fake humans.\n\n3:27:33.680 --> 3:27:36.760\n It's nice to fall in love with something\n\n3:27:36.760 --> 3:27:38.720\n that's full of novelty, yes.\n\n3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:41.540\n I could imagine all kinds of robots\n\n3:27:41.540 --> 3:27:44.280\n that I would want to have a close relationship with.\n\n3:27:44.280 --> 3:27:47.320\n And I don't mean like sexual, I mean like intimacy.\n\n3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:52.320\n But I just don't think that novelty generation\n\n3:27:52.380 --> 3:27:53.680\n is such a special.\n\n3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:57.960\n Okay, there's like mathematical novelty\n\n3:27:57.960 --> 3:27:58.800\n or something like that,\n\n3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:00.760\n and then there's just humans being surprised.\n\n3:28:00.760 --> 3:28:02.720\n I think we're easily surprised.\n\n3:28:02.720 --> 3:28:04.040\n That's fine, but that's that.\n\n3:28:04.040 --> 3:28:05.760\n But you don't think that's a good definition of novelty?\n\n3:28:05.760 --> 3:28:06.600\n No, that's good.\n\n3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:07.560\n I'm happy to be surprised,\n\n3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:11.880\n but not globally surprised because someone else,\n\n3:28:11.880 --> 3:28:14.360\n but I really want, I was wondering why I'm a scientist.\n\n3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:18.480\n I really want to be the first to be surprised about something\n\n3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:21.040\n and the first thing in the universe\n\n3:28:21.040 --> 3:28:22.400\n to create that novelty\n\n3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:24.000\n and to know for sure that that novelty\n\n3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:26.120\n has never occurred anywhere else.\n\n3:28:26.120 --> 3:28:27.520\n That's a real buzz, right?\n\n3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:29.400\n Is there a way to really know that?\n\n3:28:29.400 --> 3:28:31.480\n You have to have a really big lookup table.\n\n3:28:31.480 --> 3:28:32.320\n Right.\n\n3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:34.000\n Yeah, you're never going to be know for sure, right?\n\n3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:36.760\n That's one of the hard things about being\n\n3:28:36.760 --> 3:28:38.840\n a scientist searching for this type of novelty.\n\n3:28:38.840 --> 3:28:43.400\n Maybe that's why mathematics, mathematicians love discovery,\n\n3:28:43.400 --> 3:28:44.820\n but actually they are creating.\n\n3:28:44.820 --> 3:28:48.860\n And then when they create a new mathematical structure\n\n3:28:48.860 --> 3:28:52.160\n that they can then, you can write code to work out\n\n3:28:52.160 --> 3:28:54.840\n whether that structure exists before that.\n\n3:28:54.840 --> 3:28:57.240\n That's almost why I would love to have been a mathematician\n\n3:28:57.240 --> 3:28:59.700\n from that regard to invent new math\n\n3:28:59.700 --> 3:29:02.200\n that really I know pretty much for sure\n\n3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:04.480\n does not exist anywhere else in the universe\n\n3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:05.840\n because it's so contingent.\n\n3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:08.600\n Right, but this gets into like you said a few times\n\n3:29:08.600 --> 3:29:09.800\n that I still really don't understand\n\n3:29:09.800 --> 3:29:11.500\n how you actually plan to do this,\n\n3:29:11.500 --> 3:29:13.500\n to build an experiment that detects\n\n3:29:13.500 --> 3:29:14.960\n how the universe is generating novelty\n\n3:29:14.960 --> 3:29:16.760\n or that time is the mechanism.\n\n3:29:16.760 --> 3:29:18.860\n So the problem that we all have,\n\n3:29:18.860 --> 3:29:20.600\n which I think is what Lex is pushing against\n\n3:29:20.600 --> 3:29:23.140\n is if I build the experiment,\n\n3:29:23.140 --> 3:29:24.840\n you don't know what you put into it.\n\n3:29:24.840 --> 3:29:27.200\n So you don't know what, like if you,\n\n3:29:27.200 --> 3:29:29.280\n unless you can quantify everything you put in,\n\n3:29:29.280 --> 3:29:31.720\n all of your agency, all the boundary conditions,\n\n3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:36.020\n you don't know if you somehow biased it in some way.\n\n3:29:36.020 --> 3:29:38.600\n So is the novelty actually intrinsic to that experiment\n\n3:29:38.600 --> 3:29:40.920\n or to that robot, or is it something you gave it,\n\n3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:41.760\n but you didn't realize you gave it?\n\n3:29:41.760 --> 3:29:44.360\n It's gonna be, it's gonna asymptote towards that, right?\n\n3:29:44.360 --> 3:29:45.740\n You're never gonna know for sure,\n\n3:29:45.740 --> 3:29:47.280\n but you can start to take out,\n\n3:29:47.280 --> 3:29:50.040\n you can use good Bayesian approaches\n\n3:29:50.040 --> 3:29:52.360\n and just keep updating and updating and updating\n\n3:29:52.360 --> 3:29:54.200\n until you point to one sense of purpose.\n\n3:29:54.200 --> 3:29:56.720\n So you wanna bound on how much novelty generation\n\n3:29:56.720 --> 3:29:59.000\n it could be, got it.\n\n3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:01.080\n So the ability to generate novelty\n\n3:30:01.080 --> 3:30:03.640\n is correlated with high assembly index,\n\n3:30:03.640 --> 3:30:04.600\n with assembly index?\n\n3:30:04.600 --> 3:30:05.600\n Yeah, and yeah.\n\n3:30:07.720 --> 3:30:09.920\n Cause the space of possibilities is bigger.\n\n3:30:11.440 --> 3:30:14.480\n So that's the key.\n\n3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:17.040\n This could be a good, so I have a running joke\n\n3:30:17.040 --> 3:30:18.480\n of like why Lex is single.\n\n3:30:18.480 --> 3:30:20.480\n This could be a good part four.\n\n3:30:22.400 --> 3:30:26.360\n So what you're looking for in a robot partner\n\n3:30:26.360 --> 3:30:28.740\n is ability to generate novelty.\n\n3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:35.240\n And that's, I suppose you would say\n\n3:30:35.240 --> 3:30:37.360\n it's a good definition of intelligence too.\n\n3:30:40.580 --> 3:30:45.580\n Boy, is novelty a fuzzy concept.\n\n3:30:45.580 --> 3:30:46.940\n Is creativity better?\n\n3:30:47.940 --> 3:30:50.620\n Yeah, I mean, that's all pretty fuzzy.\n\n3:30:50.620 --> 3:30:52.340\n It's kind of the same.\n\n3:30:52.340 --> 3:30:54.340\n Maybe that's why aliens haven't come yet\n\n3:30:54.340 --> 3:30:55.980\n is cause we're not creating enough novelty.\n\n3:30:55.980 --> 3:30:58.100\n Like there's some kind of a hierarchy\n\n3:30:58.100 --> 3:30:59.420\n of novelty in the universe.\n\n3:30:59.420 --> 3:31:02.060\n Well, I think novelty is like things surprise you, right?\n\n3:31:02.060 --> 3:31:03.380\n So it's a very passive thing,\n\n3:31:03.380 --> 3:31:05.660\n but I guess what I meant by saying creativity\n\n3:31:05.660 --> 3:31:06.740\n is I think it's much more active.\n\n3:31:06.740 --> 3:31:09.020\n Like you think there's like a mechanism\n\n3:31:09.020 --> 3:31:11.660\n of like the things that exist are generating the creativity.\n\n3:31:11.660 --> 3:31:14.140\n Novelty seems to be there's some spontaneousness\n\n3:31:14.140 --> 3:31:16.980\n and it's completely decoupled from the things that exist.\n\n3:31:16.980 --> 3:31:17.820\n No, I understand.\n\n3:31:17.820 --> 3:31:22.020\n I think creativity is the mechanism\n\n3:31:22.020 --> 3:31:23.860\n and novelty is the observable.\n\n3:31:23.860 --> 3:31:24.900\n Yeah.\n\n3:31:24.900 --> 3:31:26.660\n Novelty could just be surprising.\n\n3:31:26.660 --> 3:31:29.140\n Your model of the world was broken\n\n3:31:29.140 --> 3:31:31.260\n and not necessarily in a positive way.\n\n3:31:31.260 --> 3:31:32.100\n That's surprise.\n\n3:31:32.100 --> 3:31:32.940\n So there's three things now.\n\n3:31:32.940 --> 3:31:33.780\n Let's go back.\n\n3:31:33.780 --> 3:31:34.600\n It's cool.\n\n3:31:34.600 --> 3:31:35.440\n All right, let's go.\n\n3:31:35.440 --> 3:31:37.140\n You got surprise, which is basically,\n\n3:31:37.140 --> 3:31:38.900\n I mean, I'm surprised all the time\n\n3:31:38.900 --> 3:31:39.900\n cause I don't read very much.\n\n3:31:39.900 --> 3:31:40.740\n I'm pretty dumb.\n\n3:31:40.740 --> 3:31:42.060\n I was like, oh wow, this is,\n\n3:31:42.060 --> 3:31:44.620\n I often used to invent new scientific, you know, ideas.\n\n3:31:44.620 --> 3:31:46.380\n And I was really surprised by that.\n\n3:31:46.380 --> 3:31:47.540\n And then I went and looked in literature properly\n\n3:31:47.540 --> 3:31:48.380\n and it's there.\n\n3:31:48.380 --> 3:31:50.260\n So surprise, that's to the extent\n\n3:31:50.260 --> 3:31:52.180\n that you don't have full information.\n\n3:31:53.300 --> 3:31:57.820\n Creativity, the act of pushing on that kind of\n\n3:31:57.820 --> 3:32:01.540\n on the causal structure and novelty,\n\n3:32:01.540 --> 3:32:04.580\n which is measuring that degree, right?\n\n3:32:04.580 --> 3:32:07.540\n So, and I think that's pretty well defined in that regard.\n\n3:32:07.540 --> 3:32:09.340\n So you want your robot, I mean,\n\n3:32:09.340 --> 3:32:10.740\n and in the end, this is what I'm saying,\n\n3:32:10.740 --> 3:32:13.620\n and in the end, that's why actually the way the internet\n\n3:32:13.620 --> 3:32:16.620\n and the printing press share some,\n\n3:32:16.620 --> 3:32:18.700\n I actually think creativity has dropped a bit\n\n3:32:18.700 --> 3:32:21.620\n since the internet because everyone's just, you know,\n\n3:32:21.620 --> 3:32:23.020\n just regurgitating stuff.\n\n3:32:23.020 --> 3:32:26.140\n But of course, now it's beginning to accelerate again\n\n3:32:26.140 --> 3:32:28.820\n cause everyone's using this tool to be creative\n\n3:32:28.820 --> 3:32:31.260\n and boom, it's exploding.\n\n3:32:31.260 --> 3:32:32.320\n I think that's what happens\n\n3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:34.620\n when you create these new technologies.\n\n3:32:34.620 --> 3:32:35.980\n That's really helpful.\n\n3:32:35.980 --> 3:32:38.260\n There's a difference between novelty and surprise.\n\n3:32:38.260 --> 3:32:40.980\n Okay, I think I was thinking about surprise.\n\n3:32:40.980 --> 3:32:43.100\n If you give me a toy that surprises me for a bit,\n\n3:32:43.100 --> 3:32:43.940\n it'd be great.\n\n3:32:43.940 --> 3:32:45.740\n A robot that surprises me, you know.\n\n3:32:45.740 --> 3:32:46.900\n An experiment that surprises you.\n\n3:32:46.900 --> 3:32:48.580\n Yeah, I mean, that's why I love doing experiments\n\n3:32:48.580 --> 3:32:49.540\n cause I'm, I can't.\n\n3:32:49.540 --> 3:32:50.660\n It's still exciting.\n\n3:32:50.660 --> 3:32:51.980\n Yeah. Surprise is exciting.\n\n3:32:51.980 --> 3:32:53.060\n Yeah.\n\n3:32:53.060 --> 3:32:54.220\n Even negative surprise,\n\n3:32:54.220 --> 3:32:56.460\n like some people love drama in relationships.\n\n3:32:56.460 --> 3:33:01.380\n Like, it's like, why the hell, why'd you do this?\n\n3:33:01.380 --> 3:33:02.620\n That could be exciting too.\n\n3:33:02.620 --> 3:33:04.420\n I could imagine companies selling updates\n\n3:33:04.420 --> 3:33:05.980\n to their companion robots\n\n3:33:05.980 --> 3:33:08.260\n that just basically generate negative surprise\n\n3:33:08.260 --> 3:33:10.020\n just to spice things up a bit.\n\n3:33:10.020 --> 3:33:11.580\n Yeah, it's the push and pull.\n\n3:33:11.580 --> 3:33:13.980\n That's one of the components of love.\n\n3:33:13.980 --> 3:33:16.580\n As you said, love is a complicated thing.\n\n3:33:16.580 --> 3:33:17.700\n Oh, beauty.\n\n3:33:17.700 --> 3:33:19.900\n I wanted to mention this cause you also tweeted,\n\n3:33:19.900 --> 3:33:21.240\n I think this was Sarah.\n\n3:33:21.240 --> 3:33:22.220\n No, it might've been Lee.\n\n3:33:22.220 --> 3:33:23.180\n I don't remember.\n\n3:33:23.180 --> 3:33:25.020\n But it was a survey published in Nature\n\n3:33:25.020 --> 3:33:26.660\n showing that scientists find.\n\n3:33:26.660 --> 3:33:27.540\n That was me, yeah.\n\n3:33:27.540 --> 3:33:28.940\n Yeah.\n\n3:33:28.940 --> 3:33:31.020\n Anyway, there's a plot.\n\n3:33:31.020 --> 3:33:33.320\n This is published in Nature\n\n3:33:33.320 --> 3:33:36.780\n of what scientists find beautiful in their work\n\n3:33:36.780 --> 3:33:39.260\n and it separates biologists and physicists.\n\n3:33:39.260 --> 3:33:41.780\n It'd be nice if you showed the full plot.\n\n3:33:41.780 --> 3:33:44.660\n And there's simplicity, elegance, hidden order,\n\n3:33:45.540 --> 3:33:48.340\n inner logic of systems, symmetry, complexity, harmony,\n\n3:33:48.340 --> 3:33:49.580\n and so on.\n\n3:33:49.580 --> 3:33:53.100\n Is there any interesting things that stand out to you?\n\n3:33:53.100 --> 3:33:56.020\n I think the fact that biologists like complexity\n\n3:33:56.020 --> 3:33:57.360\n and pleasing colors.\n\n3:33:59.260 --> 3:34:00.440\n Oh, there's pleasing colors on there?\n\n3:34:00.440 --> 3:34:01.280\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:34:01.280 --> 3:34:02.120\n Or shapes.\n\n3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:02.940\n Or shapes.\n\n3:34:02.940 --> 3:34:03.780\n Pleasing colors or shapes.\n\n3:34:03.780 --> 3:34:06.100\n And then physicists obviously love simplicity\n\n3:34:06.100 --> 3:34:06.920\n above all else.\n\n3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:07.760\n Simplicity and elegance.\n\n3:34:07.760 --> 3:34:09.140\n Simplicity, elegance.\n\n3:34:09.140 --> 3:34:09.980\n Yeah.\n\n3:34:09.980 --> 3:34:11.180\n They love symmetry.\n\n3:34:11.180 --> 3:34:14.640\n And then biologists love complexity.\n\n3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:17.840\n And, well, they just love a little bit less.\n\n3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:19.420\n They love everything a little bit less,\n\n3:34:19.420 --> 3:34:21.020\n but complexity a little bit more.\n\n3:34:21.020 --> 3:34:22.340\n A little bit more.\n\n3:34:22.340 --> 3:34:23.220\n That's so interesting.\n\n3:34:23.220 --> 3:34:25.220\n And pleasing colors or shapes.\n\n3:34:25.220 --> 3:34:26.220\n Do you think it's a useful,\n\n3:34:26.220 --> 3:34:27.540\n I forget what your tweet was\n\n3:34:27.540 --> 3:34:29.220\n that this is missing some of the something.\n\n3:34:29.220 --> 3:34:31.860\n Oh, no, I think it's because I think about\n\n3:34:31.860 --> 3:34:36.460\n how explanations become causal to our future.\n\n3:34:36.460 --> 3:34:39.060\n So I have this whole philosophy\n\n3:34:39.060 --> 3:34:42.300\n that the theories we build\n\n3:34:42.300 --> 3:34:44.380\n and the way we describe reality\n\n3:34:44.380 --> 3:34:49.380\n should have the largest breadth of possibilities\n\n3:34:49.380 --> 3:34:52.760\n for the future of what we can accomplish.\n\n3:34:52.760 --> 3:34:55.840\n So in some sense, it's not like Occam's razor.\n\n3:34:55.840 --> 3:34:56.920\n It's not for simplicity.\n\n3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:00.060\n It's for optimism or the kind of future you can build.\n\n3:35:00.060 --> 3:35:03.620\n And so I think you have to think this way\n\n3:35:03.620 --> 3:35:05.800\n when you're thinking about life and alien life,\n\n3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:07.780\n because ultimately we're trying to build,\n\n3:35:07.780 --> 3:35:09.220\n I mean, science is just basically\n\n3:35:09.220 --> 3:35:10.980\n our narratives about reality.\n\n3:35:10.980 --> 3:35:12.180\n And now you're building a narrative\n\n3:35:12.180 --> 3:35:14.260\n that is what we are as physical systems.\n\n3:35:14.260 --> 3:35:16.300\n It seems to me it needs to be as positive as possible\n\n3:35:16.300 --> 3:35:18.300\n because it's basically gonna shape\n\n3:35:18.300 --> 3:35:20.020\n the future trajectory where we're going.\n\n3:35:20.020 --> 3:35:22.460\n And we don't use that as a heuristic in theory building\n\n3:35:22.460 --> 3:35:23.700\n because we think theories\n\n3:35:25.700 --> 3:35:27.500\n are about predicting features of the world,\n\n3:35:27.500 --> 3:35:28.820\n not causing them.\n\n3:35:28.820 --> 3:35:30.660\n But if you look at the history of all of the development\n\n3:35:30.660 --> 3:35:33.020\n of human thought, it's caused the things that happen next.\n\n3:35:33.020 --> 3:35:35.460\n So it's not just about looking at the world\n\n3:35:35.460 --> 3:35:36.340\n and observing it.\n\n3:35:36.340 --> 3:35:41.220\n It's about actually that feedback loop that's missing.\n\n3:35:41.220 --> 3:35:43.840\n And it's not in any of those categories.\n\n3:35:46.060 --> 3:35:50.900\n What do you think is the most beautiful idea\n\n3:35:50.900 --> 3:35:54.780\n in the physics of life, in the chemistry of life,\n\n3:35:54.780 --> 3:35:57.420\n in this, through all your exploration\n\n3:35:57.420 --> 3:36:02.420\n with assembly theory, what is the thing\n\n3:36:03.840 --> 3:36:08.840\n that made you step back and say this idea is beautiful\n\n3:36:09.340 --> 3:36:10.760\n or potentially beautiful?\n\n3:36:11.700 --> 3:36:14.360\n For me, it's that the universe is a creative place.\n\n3:36:14.360 --> 3:36:18.060\n I guess I want to think, and whether it's true or not,\n\n3:36:18.060 --> 3:36:20.800\n is that we are special in some way\n\n3:36:20.800 --> 3:36:24.940\n and it's not like an arbitrary added on epiphenomenon\n\n3:36:24.940 --> 3:36:26.840\n or ad hoc feature of the universe that we exist,\n\n3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:28.580\n but it's something deep and intrinsic\n\n3:36:28.580 --> 3:36:30.060\n to the structure of reality.\n\n3:36:31.100 --> 3:36:33.220\n And to me, the most beautiful ideas that come out of that\n\n3:36:33.220 --> 3:36:37.380\n is that the reason we exist is for the universe\n\n3:36:37.380 --> 3:36:40.420\n to generate more things and to think about itself\n\n3:36:40.420 --> 3:36:45.420\n and use that as a mechanism for creating more stuff.\n\n3:36:47.060 --> 3:36:48.660\n That's for me.\n\n3:36:48.660 --> 3:36:53.660\n So like the life that this, however common it is,\n\n3:36:53.660 --> 3:36:57.500\n is an intrinsic part, is a fundamental part\n\n3:36:57.500 --> 3:36:59.940\n of this universe, at least, that we live in.\n\n3:36:59.940 --> 3:37:00.780\n I think so.\n\n3:37:00.780 --> 3:37:02.020\n I mean, it's always interesting to me\n\n3:37:02.020 --> 3:37:06.460\n because we have theories of quantum mechanics and gravity\n\n3:37:06.460 --> 3:37:07.620\n and they're supposed to be like\n\n3:37:07.620 --> 3:37:09.700\n our most fundamental theories right now.\n\n3:37:09.700 --> 3:37:12.060\n And they describe things like the interaction\n\n3:37:12.060 --> 3:37:15.380\n of massive bodies or the way that charges accelerate\n\n3:37:15.380 --> 3:37:17.300\n or all these kind of features.\n\n3:37:17.300 --> 3:37:19.620\n And they're these really deep theories\n\n3:37:19.620 --> 3:37:21.340\n and they tell us a lot about how reality works,\n\n3:37:21.340 --> 3:37:24.060\n but they're completely agnostic to our existence.\n\n3:37:24.060 --> 3:37:26.820\n And I can't help but think that whatever describes us\n\n3:37:26.820 --> 3:37:28.420\n has to be even deeper than that.\n\n3:37:29.420 --> 3:37:33.860\n And I think incorporating memory, I guess,\n\n3:37:33.860 --> 3:37:35.860\n causality, whatever the term you want to use\n\n3:37:35.860 --> 3:37:38.660\n into the physics view of the world might be.\n\n3:37:38.660 --> 3:37:40.700\n That's the easiest way to do it.\n\n3:37:40.700 --> 3:37:42.660\n It's the cleanest, so here we go again\n\n3:37:42.660 --> 3:37:44.260\n with the physicist, I'm a physicist.\n\n3:37:44.260 --> 3:37:45.980\n The cleanest, I was gonna say the simplest,\n\n3:37:45.980 --> 3:37:49.100\n most elegant way of resolving all of the kind of ways\n\n3:37:49.100 --> 3:37:53.060\n that we have these paradoxes associated with life\n\n3:37:53.060 --> 3:37:55.380\n when you, it's not that life is not,\n\n3:37:56.500 --> 3:37:59.260\n current physics is not incompatible with life,\n\n3:37:59.260 --> 3:38:00.660\n but it doesn't explain life.\n\n3:38:00.660 --> 3:38:04.260\n And then you want to know where are the explanatory gaps\n\n3:38:04.260 --> 3:38:06.340\n and this idea that we have an assembly\n\n3:38:06.340 --> 3:38:10.020\n that time is fundamental and objects actually\n\n3:38:10.020 --> 3:38:12.940\n are extended in time and have physical extent in time\n\n3:38:12.940 --> 3:38:14.180\n is the cleanest way of resolving\n\n3:38:14.180 --> 3:38:16.540\n a lot of the explanatory gaps.\n\n3:38:16.540 --> 3:38:20.060\n So I've been, I struggled with assembly theory\n\n3:38:20.060 --> 3:38:22.900\n for many years, because I could see this gap.\n\n3:38:24.220 --> 3:38:26.700\n And I think when I first met Sarah\n\n3:38:26.700 --> 3:38:30.660\n and we realized we were kind of talking\n\n3:38:30.660 --> 3:38:32.740\n about the same problem, but we were,\n\n3:38:32.740 --> 3:38:34.620\n we understood another language.\n\n3:38:34.620 --> 3:38:35.900\n It was quite hilarious actually,\n\n3:38:35.900 --> 3:38:37.820\n because it's like, I have no idea what you're talking about,\n\n3:38:37.820 --> 3:38:40.140\n but I think it sounds right.\n\n3:38:40.140 --> 3:38:42.660\n So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory\n\n3:38:42.660 --> 3:38:45.620\n is I realized the assembly theory explains\n\n3:38:45.620 --> 3:38:47.540\n why the universe, why life is the universe\n\n3:38:47.540 --> 3:38:51.380\n developing a memory, but not only that poetically,\n\n3:38:51.380 --> 3:38:53.460\n I could actually go and measure it.\n\n3:38:53.460 --> 3:38:56.580\n And I was like, holy shit, we would just,\n\n3:38:56.580 --> 3:38:59.180\n we physically measured this thing,\n\n3:38:59.180 --> 3:39:01.860\n this abstract thing, and we could measure it.\n\n3:39:01.860 --> 3:39:03.620\n And not only could we measure it,\n\n3:39:03.620 --> 3:39:06.960\n but we can then start to quantify the causal consequences.\n\n3:39:08.500 --> 3:39:13.500\n Because, I mean, I think as a kind of inventing this\n\n3:39:13.500 --> 3:39:17.300\n together with Sarah and her team, I thought\n\n3:39:17.300 --> 3:39:19.700\n there was a quite a high chance that,\n\n3:39:19.700 --> 3:39:22.220\n we're doing science, there's such a high probability\n\n3:39:22.220 --> 3:39:25.300\n we're wrong on this.\n\n3:39:25.300 --> 3:39:30.300\n And I remember kind of trying to go to hard physicists,\n\n3:39:31.300 --> 3:39:34.100\n mathematicians, complexity theorists,\n\n3:39:34.100 --> 3:39:36.400\n and everyone just kind of giving me\n\n3:39:36.400 --> 3:39:38.660\n such a hard time about it.\n\n3:39:38.660 --> 3:39:40.860\n And so, this is kind of, you've just done this,\n\n3:39:40.860 --> 3:39:43.980\n you've just done that, you've just recapitulated\n\n3:39:43.980 --> 3:39:45.620\n an old theory.\n\n3:39:45.620 --> 3:39:49.780\n And I was unable, I lacked the language to really explain,\n\n3:39:49.780 --> 3:39:52.140\n and I had to, it was a real struggle.\n\n3:39:52.140 --> 3:39:55.940\n So this realization that life, what life does\n\n3:39:55.940 --> 3:39:58.840\n that physics cannot understand, or chemistry,\n\n3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:00.780\n is the universe develops a memory\n\n3:40:00.780 --> 3:40:04.780\n that's causally actionable, and then we can measure it,\n\n3:40:04.780 --> 3:40:07.180\n but it isn't just a one thing,\n\n3:40:07.180 --> 3:40:08.620\n there is this intrinsic property\n\n3:40:08.620 --> 3:40:09.740\n of all the objects in the universe.\n\n3:40:09.740 --> 3:40:13.260\n Like I've said before, but me holding up this water bottle,\n\n3:40:13.260 --> 3:40:14.500\n it isn't any other water bottle,\n\n3:40:14.500 --> 3:40:16.300\n but it is a sum total of all the water bottles\n\n3:40:16.300 --> 3:40:18.920\n that have existed, right?\n\n3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:22.700\n And will likely change the future of water bottles\n\n3:40:22.700 --> 3:40:23.580\n and for other objects.\n\n3:40:23.580 --> 3:40:26.580\n So it's this kind of, so for me,\n\n3:40:26.580 --> 3:40:31.460\n assembly theory explains the soul in stuff.\n\n3:40:31.460 --> 3:40:32.700\n The monology.\n\n3:40:32.700 --> 3:40:34.740\n But it is the monology, it's not like\n\n3:40:34.740 --> 3:40:36.300\n Sheldrake's morphic resonance,\n\n3:40:36.300 --> 3:40:37.940\n where we have this kind of wooey thing\n\n3:40:37.940 --> 3:40:40.900\n permeating the universe, it is the interaction\n\n3:40:40.900 --> 3:40:42.540\n of objects of other objects.\n\n3:40:42.540 --> 3:40:46.500\n And some objects have more instantaneous causal power,\n\n3:40:46.500 --> 3:40:51.060\n that's life, living things, and some objects\n\n3:40:51.060 --> 3:40:54.260\n are the instantaneous output of that causal power,\n\n3:40:54.260 --> 3:40:56.260\n dead objects, but they're part of the lineage.\n\n3:40:56.260 --> 3:40:58.980\n And that for me is fascinating and really beautiful.\n\n3:40:58.980 --> 3:41:01.220\n And I think that even if we're determined\n\n3:41:01.220 --> 3:41:04.940\n to be totally wrong, I think it will help us,\n\n3:41:04.940 --> 3:41:07.420\n help hopefully understand what life is\n\n3:41:07.420 --> 3:41:10.300\n and go into tech life elsewhere and make life in the lab.\n\n3:41:10.300 --> 3:41:11.740\n How does that make you feel, by the way?\n\n3:41:11.740 --> 3:41:13.600\n Does it make you feel less special,\n\n3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:16.100\n that you're so deeply integrated,\n\n3:41:16.100 --> 3:41:18.180\n interconnected to the lineage?\n\n3:41:18.180 --> 3:41:20.460\n I mean, okay, on one level, I just wanted in my life\n\n3:41:20.460 --> 3:41:23.020\n as a scientist, I wanted to have an interesting idea\n\n3:41:23.020 --> 3:41:25.540\n just once or an original idea.\n\n3:41:25.540 --> 3:41:29.680\n I mean, it was like, you know, so I think that was cool\n\n3:41:29.680 --> 3:41:31.580\n that we had this idea and we were playing with it.\n\n3:41:31.580 --> 3:41:34.740\n And I think also that I kind of, I mean,\n\n3:41:34.740 --> 3:41:37.540\n it took me ages to realize that Sarah had also had\n\n3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:40.300\n the same kind of form, coming towards the same formulation\n\n3:41:40.300 --> 3:41:43.980\n just from a completely different point because I,\n\n3:41:43.980 --> 3:41:45.340\n but no, it makes me feel special.\n\n3:41:45.340 --> 3:41:47.020\n And it also makes me feel connected to the universe.\n\n3:41:47.020 --> 3:41:50.980\n It also makes me feel not just humble about, you know,\n\n3:41:50.980 --> 3:41:53.540\n being a living object in the universe,\n\n3:41:53.540 --> 3:41:55.660\n but the fact that it makes me really optimistic\n\n3:41:55.660 --> 3:41:58.180\n about what the universe is gonna do in the future\n\n3:41:58.180 --> 3:42:02.780\n because we're not just isolated phenomena, we are connected.\n\n3:42:02.780 --> 3:42:06.140\n I will be able to have, you know, one of my small objectives\n\n3:42:06.140 --> 3:42:08.740\n in life is to change the future of the universe\n\n3:42:08.740 --> 3:42:12.340\n in some profound way, just by existing.\n\n3:42:12.340 --> 3:42:14.360\n Yeah, that's not ambitious at all.\n\n3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:15.200\n Uh.\n\n3:42:19.200 --> 3:42:21.980\n I think it's also good because it makes me feel less lonely\n\n3:42:21.980 --> 3:42:23.340\n because I just realized I'm not like,\n\n3:42:23.340 --> 3:42:24.940\n I mean, I'm a unique assembly structure,\n\n3:42:24.940 --> 3:42:27.100\n but I have so much overlap with the other entities\n\n3:42:27.100 --> 3:42:31.500\n I interact with that we're not completely individual, right?\n\n3:42:31.500 --> 3:42:36.500\n And yet your existence does have a huge amount of impact\n\n3:42:37.340 --> 3:42:41.420\n on how this whole thing unrolls on the future of the world.\n\n3:42:41.420 --> 3:42:43.540\n As individuals, that's, yeah.\n\n3:42:43.540 --> 3:42:45.860\n But I was gonna say. Local packets of agency.\n\n3:42:45.860 --> 3:42:48.340\n I think we all have a profound impact on the future,\n\n3:42:48.340 --> 3:42:49.460\n some more than others, right?\n\n3:42:49.460 --> 3:42:50.900\n All human beings, all life.\n\n3:42:50.900 --> 3:42:53.900\n And I mean, that's why I think it's a privilege\n\n3:42:53.900 --> 3:42:55.500\n in a way for, you know, to say,\n\n3:42:55.500 --> 3:42:59.100\n to assert some degree of ego and agency,\n\n3:42:59.100 --> 3:43:00.460\n you know, I'm gonna make a computer\n\n3:43:00.460 --> 3:43:02.740\n or make an origin life machine or we can do this thing.\n\n3:43:02.740 --> 3:43:04.100\n But actually it's just like, you know,\n\n3:43:04.100 --> 3:43:07.060\n my life's probably living, if there is a God\n\n3:43:07.060 --> 3:43:08.660\n or there's a soul in everything,\n\n3:43:08.660 --> 3:43:10.380\n it's really laughing at us going,\n\n3:43:10.380 --> 3:43:12.420\n I fool these guys by giving them ego.\n\n3:43:12.420 --> 3:43:14.500\n So they strive for this stuff and look what it does\n\n3:43:14.500 --> 3:43:17.900\n for the assembly space of the universe.\n\n3:43:17.900 --> 3:43:18.940\n And there's always a possibility\n\n3:43:18.940 --> 3:43:20.380\n that science can't answer all of it.\n\n3:43:20.380 --> 3:43:23.340\n So that part's challenging for me.\n\n3:43:23.340 --> 3:43:25.440\n There might be a limit to this thing.\n\n3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:29.660\n Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions\n\n3:43:29.660 --> 3:43:34.140\n and I demand relatively short answers.\n\n3:43:34.140 --> 3:43:36.540\n Lee, what's the scariest thing you've ever done?\n\n3:43:40.980 --> 3:43:43.840\n Or what's a scary thing that pops to mind?\n\n3:43:45.020 --> 3:43:48.500\n Giving seminars in front of other scientists.\n\n3:43:48.500 --> 3:43:50.940\n That's, yeah, that is terrifying.\n\n3:43:50.940 --> 3:43:54.300\n I could, if I had more time,\n\n3:43:54.300 --> 3:43:56.180\n I would ask you about the most embarrassing,\n\n3:43:56.180 --> 3:43:57.460\n but we'll spare you.\n\n3:43:57.460 --> 3:43:59.860\n What about you Sarah, scariest thing?\n\n3:44:01.500 --> 3:44:04.240\n Up there, some of the scary things you've done.\n\n3:44:05.880 --> 3:44:08.260\n Actually the scariest for me was deciding\n\n3:44:08.260 --> 3:44:09.220\n I wanted to get divorced\n\n3:44:09.220 --> 3:44:11.900\n because it was like a totally radical like.\n\n3:44:11.900 --> 3:44:12.740\n Life transformation.\n\n3:44:12.740 --> 3:44:16.100\n Yeah, because we had been married for a really long time.\n\n3:44:16.100 --> 3:44:18.280\n And I think it was just so much like,\n\n3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:21.240\n I realized like so much of my individual agency\n\n3:44:21.240 --> 3:44:22.380\n I didn't realize I had before.\n\n3:44:22.380 --> 3:44:24.920\n And that was just really like scary, like empowering scary,\n\n3:44:24.920 --> 3:44:25.900\n but like terrifying.\n\n3:44:25.900 --> 3:44:28.660\n Like you were living in a kind of one way\n\n3:44:28.660 --> 3:44:29.500\n for your whole life.\n\n3:44:29.500 --> 3:44:31.460\n And then you realized your life could be a different way.\n\n3:44:31.460 --> 3:44:32.300\n And.\n\n3:44:32.300 --> 3:44:33.780\n Yeah, there's a between humans.\n\n3:44:33.780 --> 3:44:36.900\n I mean, that's the beautiful thing about love\n\n3:44:36.900 --> 3:44:38.260\n is the connection you have,\n\n3:44:38.260 --> 3:44:41.040\n but it's also becomes a dependency and breaking that.\n\n3:44:41.040 --> 3:44:43.040\n Whether it's a mentor, what's your parents,\n\n3:44:43.040 --> 3:44:43.880\n your close friends.\n\n3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:44.900\n It's almost like waking up.\n\n3:44:44.900 --> 3:44:46.820\n Like just there's a different reality.\n\n3:44:46.820 --> 3:44:48.040\n Yeah, that was scary.\n\n3:44:48.040 --> 3:44:49.680\n Reinventing yourself.\n\n3:44:49.680 --> 3:44:51.860\n Okay, if you could, Lee,\n\n3:44:51.860 --> 3:44:54.020\n maybe I'll actually we'll alternate.\n\n3:44:54.020 --> 3:44:56.660\n Sarah, if you could be someone else for a day,\n\n3:44:56.660 --> 3:44:57.940\n someone alive today,\n\n3:44:57.940 --> 3:45:00.720\n you haven't met yet, haven't met yet.\n\n3:45:00.720 --> 3:45:02.620\n Or maybe you could do one who you've met.\n\n3:45:02.620 --> 3:45:03.940\n Who would it be?\n\n3:45:03.940 --> 3:45:05.020\n Kim Kardashian.\n\n3:45:06.020 --> 3:45:07.460\n No joke.\n\n3:45:07.460 --> 3:45:08.420\n The woman's brilliant.\n\n3:45:08.420 --> 3:45:09.660\n I would just like to experience,\n\n3:45:09.660 --> 3:45:12.740\n like I just, I think she's got such an interesting\n\n3:45:14.020 --> 3:45:16.660\n and very deep understanding of social reality.\n\n3:45:16.660 --> 3:45:19.220\n But you also said you have appreciation\n\n3:45:19.220 --> 3:45:20.340\n of love for fashion.\n\n3:45:20.340 --> 3:45:21.340\n I do.\n\n3:45:21.340 --> 3:45:22.900\n But that's actually the same.\n\n3:45:22.900 --> 3:45:24.380\n Like I just think it's really interesting\n\n3:45:24.380 --> 3:45:25.620\n because we live in a social reality\n\n3:45:25.620 --> 3:45:27.860\n which is completely artificially constructed.\n\n3:45:27.860 --> 3:45:30.220\n And some people are really genius about moving through that.\n\n3:45:30.220 --> 3:45:31.620\n And I think she's particularly good at it.\n\n3:45:31.620 --> 3:45:33.940\n I wonder if she's good at understanding or if she's just.\n\n3:45:33.940 --> 3:45:35.620\n I think it's very deeply intrinsic to her.\n\n3:45:35.620 --> 3:45:36.460\n So I don't know if she has much.\n\n3:45:36.460 --> 3:45:37.700\n She's like surfing a wave.\n\n3:45:37.700 --> 3:45:39.500\n How much cognitive awareness she has of it\n\n3:45:39.500 --> 3:45:40.500\n or how strategic it is.\n\n3:45:40.500 --> 3:45:42.160\n But I think it's deeply fascinating.\n\n3:45:42.160 --> 3:45:44.740\n So I guess that's the first one that comes to mind.\n\n3:45:44.740 --> 3:45:45.660\n What about you, Lee?\n\n3:45:45.660 --> 3:45:47.820\n If you could be somebody for a day.\n\n3:45:47.820 --> 3:45:48.940\n Don't say Yoshua Bach.\n\n3:45:49.940 --> 3:45:51.700\n Don't say Kim Kardashian.\n\n3:45:51.700 --> 3:45:53.020\n Let's do it off the table.\n\n3:45:53.020 --> 3:45:53.980\n Off the table.\n\n3:45:53.980 --> 3:45:56.260\n No, I was gonna say I would like to be a,\n\n3:45:57.220 --> 3:45:58.100\n does it have to be here today?\n\n3:45:58.100 --> 3:46:03.100\n I was gonna say I'd like to be the latest arm processor.\n\n3:46:04.900 --> 3:46:06.300\n Interesting.\n\n3:46:06.300 --> 3:46:07.740\n I would like to be the latest arm processor.\n\n3:46:07.740 --> 3:46:09.980\n I'd like to understand.\n\n3:46:09.980 --> 3:46:12.540\n I would like to know what it feel like to basically.\n\n3:46:14.180 --> 3:46:15.180\n You like being objects.\n\n3:46:15.180 --> 3:46:16.020\n I like being objects.\n\n3:46:16.020 --> 3:46:17.460\n I've always obsessed with being objects\n\n3:46:17.460 --> 3:46:18.460\n ever since I was a kid.\n\n3:46:18.460 --> 3:46:21.180\n What's the best part of being an arm processor for a day?\n\n3:46:21.180 --> 3:46:23.460\n I mean, I'd like to understand how I access my memory,\n\n3:46:23.460 --> 3:46:25.900\n what it anticipates coming next in clock cycles.\n\n3:46:25.900 --> 3:46:27.620\n What about how it feels like?\n\n3:46:27.620 --> 3:46:30.260\n Yeah, I wanna know how it feels like to be.\n\n3:46:30.260 --> 3:46:31.100\n To be useful.\n\n3:46:33.020 --> 3:46:33.860\n Thanks for that.\n\n3:46:37.420 --> 3:46:42.300\n All right, if, Lee, if everyone on Earth disappeared\n\n3:46:42.300 --> 3:46:45.980\n and it was just you left, what would your days look like?\n\n3:46:45.980 --> 3:46:46.820\n What would you do?\n\n3:46:46.820 --> 3:46:48.820\n Nobody else left to impress.\n\n3:46:48.820 --> 3:46:52.300\n Nobody, no, probably can't really do any real science\n\n3:46:52.300 --> 3:46:53.380\n at scale.\n\n3:46:53.380 --> 3:46:55.700\n What would you do with your remaining days?\n\n3:46:55.700 --> 3:46:59.140\n Get every possible tool I could\n\n3:46:59.140 --> 3:47:01.980\n and put it in my workshop and just make stuff.\n\n3:47:01.980 --> 3:47:04.060\n As, so try to make stuff.\n\n3:47:04.060 --> 3:47:05.180\n Just try and make stuff.\n\n3:47:05.180 --> 3:47:06.020\n Make companions.\n\n3:47:06.020 --> 3:47:08.660\n I'm pretty much making companions probably, yeah.\n\n3:47:08.660 --> 3:47:09.900\n So in the physical space.\n\n3:47:09.900 --> 3:47:11.420\n Yeah.\n\n3:47:11.420 --> 3:47:12.300\n What about you, Sarah?\n\n3:47:12.300 --> 3:47:15.180\n What would you, when you're just left alone on Earth,\n\n3:47:15.180 --> 3:47:16.020\n you're the last person.\n\n3:47:16.020 --> 3:47:17.980\n Are there animals in this scenario?\n\n3:47:17.980 --> 3:47:19.340\n No living beings.\n\n3:47:19.340 --> 3:47:21.020\n No plants?\n\n3:47:21.020 --> 3:47:22.060\n No plants.\n\n3:47:23.340 --> 3:47:24.180\n Oh, interesting.\n\n3:47:24.180 --> 3:47:25.220\n I was gonna say, I would just,\n\n3:47:25.220 --> 3:47:26.820\n I would try to walk the entire planet,\n\n3:47:26.820 --> 3:47:28.900\n at least all the landmass.\n\n3:47:28.900 --> 3:47:29.980\n Well, that's true.\n\n3:47:29.980 --> 3:47:33.860\n So you probably don't know if there's stuff.\n\n3:47:33.860 --> 3:47:36.500\n You could be searching for plants or other humans\n\n3:47:36.500 --> 3:47:38.100\n or other animals. And what would I eat?\n\n3:47:40.980 --> 3:47:44.860\n You just have daily just allotment.\n\n3:47:44.860 --> 3:47:46.020\n I would just walk all the time, I think.\n\n3:47:46.020 --> 3:47:46.900\n Of Soylent.\n\n3:47:46.900 --> 3:47:47.860\n I don't know why.\n\n3:47:47.860 --> 3:47:48.700\n Just walk.\n\n3:47:48.700 --> 3:47:49.540\n That's just what came to mind.\n\n3:47:49.540 --> 3:47:50.380\n You're the explorer.\n\n3:47:50.380 --> 3:47:51.420\n I would just walk.\n\n3:47:51.420 --> 3:47:53.020\n And I guess I would make a goal of covering\n\n3:47:53.020 --> 3:47:54.740\n all of the entire Earth.\n\n3:47:54.740 --> 3:47:56.380\n Because what else are you gonna do with your time?\n\n3:47:56.380 --> 3:47:58.860\n What's an item on your bucket list, Sarah,\n\n3:47:58.860 --> 3:48:01.220\n that you haven't done yet, but you hope to do?\n\n3:48:02.780 --> 3:48:04.180\n Skydiving.\n\n3:48:04.180 --> 3:48:05.420\n Travel to space.\n\n3:48:08.460 --> 3:48:10.100\n I don't know.\n\n3:48:10.100 --> 3:48:11.700\n You know what's funny with my bucket list?\n\n3:48:11.700 --> 3:48:14.300\n I only know it was on my bucket list once I check it off.\n\n3:48:14.300 --> 3:48:15.180\n Once you check it off.\n\n3:48:15.180 --> 3:48:17.060\n So your bucket list is like a fog.\n\n3:48:17.060 --> 3:48:20.020\n It's like a mystery almost by doing it.\n\n3:48:20.020 --> 3:48:22.740\n Yeah, so it's very subconsciously driven.\n\n3:48:22.740 --> 3:48:24.700\n So it's in your subconscious in there.\n\n3:48:24.700 --> 3:48:25.540\n I think so.\n\n3:48:25.540 --> 3:48:26.460\n You're bringing it to the surface.\n\n3:48:26.460 --> 3:48:28.020\n I think most of the steering of our agency\n\n3:48:28.020 --> 3:48:29.140\n is in our subconscious anyway,\n\n3:48:29.140 --> 3:48:30.340\n so I just kind of go with the flow.\n\n3:48:30.340 --> 3:48:33.340\n But I guess, no, seriously.\n\n3:48:33.340 --> 3:48:35.060\n Yeah, no, I get it.\n\n3:48:35.060 --> 3:48:35.900\n I don't know.\n\n3:48:35.900 --> 3:48:37.180\n I guess, but I would like to go on a submarine,\n\n3:48:37.180 --> 3:48:38.020\n like to the bottom of the ocean.\n\n3:48:38.020 --> 3:48:38.980\n I think that'd be really cool.\n\n3:48:38.980 --> 3:48:40.340\n To the bottom of the ocean.\n\n3:48:40.340 --> 3:48:42.500\n Are you captivated by the mystery of the ocean?\n\n3:48:42.500 --> 3:48:43.340\n Like how little you know.\n\n3:48:43.340 --> 3:48:44.180\n I am, yeah.\n\n3:48:44.180 --> 3:48:47.700\n Yeah, what about you, Lee?\n\n3:48:47.700 --> 3:48:50.420\n What item on your bucket list?\n\n3:48:50.420 --> 3:48:51.940\n I don't have a bucket list, but I've just made one.\n\n3:48:51.940 --> 3:48:55.660\n I would love to take a computer to the moon or Mars\n\n3:48:55.660 --> 3:48:57.500\n and make drugs off world.\n\n3:48:57.500 --> 3:49:00.740\n Be the first chemist to make drugs off world.\n\n3:49:00.740 --> 3:49:02.620\n The first drug manufacturer in space.\n\n3:49:02.620 --> 3:49:03.700\n Yeah, why not?\n\n3:49:03.700 --> 3:49:04.540\n Drugs in space.\n\n3:49:04.540 --> 3:49:07.020\n Do they have to be somehow like be able to habitate,\n\n3:49:07.020 --> 3:49:10.600\n like be able to survive on that particular space?\n\n3:49:10.600 --> 3:49:13.420\n Or like what's the connection between being on Mars\n\n3:49:13.420 --> 3:49:14.260\n and doing many things?\n\n3:49:14.260 --> 3:49:15.100\n I just would like to be there.\n\n3:49:15.100 --> 3:49:18.900\n I would like to take the ability to have command\n\n3:49:18.900 --> 3:49:22.500\n and control over chemicals programmatically off earth\n\n3:49:22.500 --> 3:49:24.180\n to somewhere else in the universe.\n\n3:49:24.180 --> 3:49:26.140\n That just seems like you like difficulty\n\n3:49:26.140 --> 3:49:28.740\n engineering problems.\n\n3:49:28.740 --> 3:49:29.940\n Before I die, if I can do that, that's great.\n\n3:49:29.940 --> 3:49:32.180\n Would you travel to space if you could?\n\n3:49:32.180 --> 3:49:33.020\n Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.\n\n3:49:33.020 --> 3:49:35.820\n I'd love to go into space, but not just to be a tourist.\n\n3:49:35.820 --> 3:49:38.460\n I wanna take scientific experiment in space\n\n3:49:38.460 --> 3:49:41.140\n and do a thing in space that's never been done before.\n\n3:49:41.140 --> 3:49:42.940\n That's a real possibility.\n\n3:49:42.940 --> 3:49:44.340\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:49:44.340 --> 3:49:46.420\n So that's why there's no point in listening\n\n3:49:46.420 --> 3:49:48.980\n things I can't do, yeah.\n\n3:49:48.980 --> 3:49:52.500\n All right, what small act of kindness\n\n3:49:52.500 --> 3:49:54.900\n were you once shown that you will never forget?\n\n3:49:56.220 --> 3:49:59.500\n Small act of kindness, not big.\n\n3:49:59.500 --> 3:50:01.020\n Somebody was just kind to you.\n\n3:50:01.020 --> 3:50:03.300\n Somebody did something sweet.\n\n3:50:03.300 --> 3:50:08.300\n When I was a PhD student, someone helped me out\n\n3:50:08.300 --> 3:50:13.300\n with just, basically, I needed a computer.\n\n3:50:13.540 --> 3:50:15.420\n I needed some power, computation power,\n\n3:50:15.420 --> 3:50:18.340\n and someone took pity on me and helped me.\n\n3:50:18.340 --> 3:50:19.180\n I was really touched.\n\n3:50:19.180 --> 3:50:20.180\n They didn't have to.\n\n3:50:20.180 --> 3:50:23.020\n And they were actually quite, they were a disabled scientist\n\n3:50:23.020 --> 3:50:24.180\n and they had other things to do\n\n3:50:24.180 --> 3:50:26.340\n rather than help some random PhD student.\n\n3:50:26.340 --> 3:50:29.140\n Gave me access, taught me a lot of stuff.\n\n3:50:29.140 --> 3:50:30.900\n Yeah, actually, when you're a grad student\n\n3:50:30.900 --> 3:50:33.340\n or when you're a student, when you're even a student,\n\n3:50:33.340 --> 3:50:35.660\n the younger it is, the better.\n\n3:50:35.660 --> 3:50:38.740\n The attention, the support, the love you get\n\n3:50:38.740 --> 3:50:40.580\n from an older person, a teacher,\n\n3:50:40.580 --> 3:50:42.660\n something like that is super powerful.\n\n3:50:42.660 --> 3:50:43.580\n It's fascinating.\n\n3:50:43.580 --> 3:50:45.500\n And from the perspective of the teacher,\n\n3:50:45.500 --> 3:50:47.580\n they might not realize the impact they have,\n\n3:50:47.580 --> 3:50:51.460\n but that little bit, those few words,\n\n3:50:51.460 --> 3:50:54.660\n a little bit of help can have a lot of impact.\n\n3:50:54.660 --> 3:50:55.700\n What about you, Sarah?\n\n3:50:56.860 --> 3:50:59.300\n Somebody give you a free Starbucks at some point?\n\n3:50:59.300 --> 3:51:00.500\n I love free Starbucks.\n\n3:51:00.500 --> 3:51:03.300\n I like it when you're in the line at Starbucks\n\n3:51:03.300 --> 3:51:05.020\n and somebody buys your coffee in front of you\n\n3:51:05.020 --> 3:51:05.860\n and then you buy the next one.\n\n3:51:05.860 --> 3:51:08.260\n I love those, but that's not my example.\n\n3:51:08.260 --> 3:51:09.460\n Those are great.\n\n3:51:09.460 --> 3:51:10.300\n It makes me happy.\n\n3:51:10.300 --> 3:51:11.700\n And now my kids get all excited when we do it,\n\n3:51:11.700 --> 3:51:14.020\n when we go in, we're the first ones in line doing it.\n\n3:51:14.020 --> 3:51:19.020\n But I guess I can use a similar example\n\n3:51:20.700 --> 3:51:21.980\n about just being a student.\n\n3:51:22.980 --> 3:51:26.460\n So Paul Davies is a very well known theoretical physicist\n\n3:51:26.460 --> 3:51:31.060\n and he was generous enough with his time\n\n3:51:31.060 --> 3:51:32.980\n to take me on as a postdoc.\n\n3:51:32.980 --> 3:51:34.500\n But before I became his postdoc,\n\n3:51:34.500 --> 3:51:35.540\n he invited me to a workshop\n\n3:51:35.540 --> 3:51:37.540\n at Arizona State University in the Beyond Center\n\n3:51:37.540 --> 3:51:40.620\n and took a walk with me around campus\n\n3:51:40.620 --> 3:51:42.220\n just to talk about ideas after.\n\n3:51:42.220 --> 3:51:44.180\n And I think there were two things\n\n3:51:44.180 --> 3:51:48.260\n that were completely generous about that.\n\n3:51:48.260 --> 3:51:51.740\n One is Paul's philosophy is always interacting\n\n3:51:51.740 --> 3:51:52.660\n with young people.\n\n3:51:52.660 --> 3:51:54.980\n It's like you interact with a mind in the room.\n\n3:51:54.980 --> 3:51:57.940\n It doesn't matter how well known or whatever.\n\n3:51:57.940 --> 3:52:01.060\n It's like you evaluate the person for the person.\n\n3:52:01.060 --> 3:52:02.780\n But he also gave me a book,\n\n3:52:02.780 --> 3:52:05.620\n The Eerie Silence that he had written and he wrote in it,\n\n3:52:05.620 --> 3:52:08.100\n This is How EE Gets to ET,\n\n3:52:08.980 --> 3:52:10.700\n which was an antimeric excess,\n\n3:52:10.700 --> 3:52:12.260\n which I worked on as a PhD student\n\n3:52:12.260 --> 3:52:14.180\n was the origin of homochirality\n\n3:52:14.180 --> 3:52:15.340\n all the way up to what the book was about,\n\n3:52:15.340 --> 3:52:16.900\n which was are we alone in the universe\n\n3:52:16.900 --> 3:52:19.100\n and is there intelligent life out there?\n\n3:52:19.100 --> 3:52:24.100\n And it was just so much about the questions I wanted to ask\n\n3:52:24.260 --> 3:52:26.620\n because it was just everything about,\n\n3:52:26.620 --> 3:52:29.740\n just it was just really, really kind.\n\n3:52:29.740 --> 3:52:32.340\n Like that it's okay to ask these questions\n\n3:52:32.340 --> 3:52:35.100\n and you can actually have strong enough to answer them.\n\n3:52:35.100 --> 3:52:37.140\n A lot of my career is mostly his encouragement\n\n3:52:37.140 --> 3:52:38.100\n to ask deep questions.\n\n3:52:38.100 --> 3:52:39.300\n Like he gave me the space to do it\n\n3:52:39.300 --> 3:52:41.620\n in ways that a lot of previous mentors had.\n\n3:52:41.620 --> 3:52:43.860\n I mean, I've had a good experience with mentors,\n\n3:52:43.860 --> 3:52:46.180\n but it was like go off the deep end,\n\n3:52:46.180 --> 3:52:47.940\n ask the hardest questions.\n\n3:52:47.940 --> 3:52:50.580\n And I think that's the best gift you can give somebody.\n\n3:52:50.580 --> 3:52:51.420\n What would you,\n\n3:52:51.420 --> 3:52:53.040\n because you're both fascinating minds\n\n3:52:53.040 --> 3:52:58.040\n and not, I would say, nonstandard in the best possible way.\n\n3:52:58.040 --> 3:53:01.560\n Is there advice you can give to young folks\n\n3:53:01.560 --> 3:53:04.360\n how to be nonstandard, how to stand out,\n\n3:53:04.360 --> 3:53:06.080\n novelty, how to generate novelty?\n\n3:53:06.080 --> 3:53:08.000\n That's what I want on my tombstone.\n\n3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:08.840\n I have one.\n\n3:53:08.840 --> 3:53:11.600\n He generated novelty.\n\n3:53:11.600 --> 3:53:12.440\n No, no, how to.\n\n3:53:12.440 --> 3:53:13.280\n Oh, how to.\n\n3:53:13.280 --> 3:53:15.280\n How, how, still.\n\n3:53:16.680 --> 3:53:18.080\n I just love doing science.\n\n3:53:18.080 --> 3:53:21.280\n And so when I was younger, I was just,\n\n3:53:21.280 --> 3:53:23.040\n just wanted to, I mean, I'm still not sure\n\n3:53:23.040 --> 3:53:24.160\n I'm a real scientist, right?\n\n3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:25.600\n So I want to try.\n\n3:53:25.600 --> 3:53:27.080\n So my advice for the young people\n\n3:53:27.080 --> 3:53:30.360\n is just, if you just, if you love asking questions,\n\n3:53:30.360 --> 3:53:33.000\n then don't be afraid to ask the question,\n\n3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:34.400\n even if it pisses people off,\n\n3:53:34.400 --> 3:53:36.080\n because if you piss people off,\n\n3:53:36.080 --> 3:53:39.040\n you're probably asking the right question.\n\n3:53:39.040 --> 3:53:41.080\n What I would say though, is don't do what I did,\n\n3:53:41.080 --> 3:53:43.600\n which is just piss everyone off.\n\n3:53:43.600 --> 3:53:47.080\n Try and work out how to, you know, I think,\n\n3:53:48.400 --> 3:53:51.000\n if other people are challenged by your questions,\n\n3:53:51.960 --> 3:53:55.200\n you will get not only respect,\n\n3:53:55.200 --> 3:53:57.760\n but people will give you, create space for you,\n\n3:53:57.760 --> 3:54:00.600\n because you're doing something really new.\n\n3:54:00.600 --> 3:54:03.680\n I really try to create space in my academic career,\n\n3:54:03.680 --> 3:54:07.280\n with my team, really try and praise them\n\n3:54:07.280 --> 3:54:08.760\n and push them to do new things.\n\n3:54:08.760 --> 3:54:12.400\n So my advice is, try to do new things,\n\n3:54:12.400 --> 3:54:15.560\n get feedback, and the universe will help you.\n\n3:54:15.560 --> 3:54:17.800\n Excellent.\n\n3:54:17.800 --> 3:54:19.120\n Because the universe likes novelty.\n\n3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:19.960\n I think so.\n\n3:54:19.960 --> 3:54:21.000\n I think so, right?\n\n3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:23.200\n This one will keep them around.\n\n3:54:23.200 --> 3:54:24.040\n Oh my God.\n\n3:54:24.040 --> 3:54:26.240\n What about you, Sarah?\n\n3:54:26.240 --> 3:54:29.800\n You too like to ask the really out there big questions.\n\n3:54:29.800 --> 3:54:32.840\n Yeah, because I have a strong passion for them.\n\n3:54:32.840 --> 3:54:36.160\n So I think it goes back to the love.\n\n3:54:36.160 --> 3:54:38.520\n Like if you're doing the thing you're supposed to be doing,\n\n3:54:38.520 --> 3:54:40.480\n you should really love it.\n\n3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:42.080\n So I always tell people that they should do\n\n3:54:42.080 --> 3:54:43.320\n the thing they're most passionate about.\n\n3:54:43.320 --> 3:54:45.640\n But I think a flip side of that is,\n\n3:54:45.640 --> 3:54:48.080\n that's when you become in some way,\n\n3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:49.240\n like not to sound cheesy,\n\n3:54:49.240 --> 3:54:51.000\n but like your best version of yourself.\n\n3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:54.800\n So I guess for me, as I become more successful in my career,\n\n3:54:54.800 --> 3:54:57.480\n I feel like I can be more myself as an individual.\n\n3:54:57.480 --> 3:54:59.360\n And so there's this, I've always been following\n\n3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:00.880\n the questions I'm most interested in,\n\n3:55:00.880 --> 3:55:03.480\n which very early on I was discouraged\n\n3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:04.840\n from doing by many people\n\n3:55:04.840 --> 3:55:06.760\n because they thought they were unanswerable questions.\n\n3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:08.160\n And I always just thought,\n\n3:55:08.160 --> 3:55:10.560\n well, if no one's even trying to answer them,\n\n3:55:10.560 --> 3:55:12.360\n of course they're gonna be unanswerable.\n\n3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:13.800\n And then that was kind of an odd viewpoint.\n\n3:55:13.800 --> 3:55:16.800\n But the more I found my way in that space,\n\n3:55:16.800 --> 3:55:19.960\n the more I also made a space for myself as a person,\n\n3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:23.080\n because you're basically generating the niche\n\n3:55:23.080 --> 3:55:24.800\n that you wanna exist in.\n\n3:55:24.800 --> 3:55:29.360\n And so I think that's part of it,\n\n3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:30.760\n is not just to follow your passion,\n\n3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:31.840\n but also think about like,\n\n3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:34.720\n who do you wanna be and create that?\n\n3:55:35.680 --> 3:55:38.080\n Yeah, who am I, who do you wanna be?\n\n3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:40.880\n I mean, yeah, play temporally with it.\n\n3:55:40.880 --> 3:55:41.760\n Yeah, who am I now?\n\n3:55:41.760 --> 3:55:42.920\n Who do I wanna be now?\n\n3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:44.240\n But who do I wanna be in the future?\n\n3:55:44.240 --> 3:55:45.560\n They're not decoupled.\n\n3:55:45.560 --> 3:55:48.240\n Yeah, I always wonder if that's like,\n\n3:55:48.240 --> 3:55:52.680\n if I become something, am I finding myself\n\n3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:54.960\n or am I creating myself?\n\n3:55:54.960 --> 3:55:58.040\n And I think those are somehow the same kind of thing.\n\n3:55:58.040 --> 3:56:00.480\n I do feel often like I was always meant\n\n3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:02.160\n to be this kind of thing.\n\n3:56:02.160 --> 3:56:06.160\n But is that created or discovered?\n\n3:56:06.160 --> 3:56:07.000\n I don't know.\n\n3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:09.560\n But basically go towards that direction.\n\n3:56:09.560 --> 3:56:12.320\n If you were abducted by aliens, Sarah.\n\n3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:15.320\n Excellent, I'm waiting, they can come find me.\n\n3:56:15.320 --> 3:56:16.480\n They're on a spaceship.\n\n3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:20.840\n And then they somehow figured out the language you speak\n\n3:56:22.560 --> 3:56:25.760\n and ask you, what are you?\n\n3:56:25.760 --> 3:56:29.080\n What is, explain yourself.\n\n3:56:29.080 --> 3:56:31.320\n Not you, Sarah, but the species.\n\n3:56:31.320 --> 3:56:32.160\n Oh.\n\n3:56:33.400 --> 3:56:37.920\n Life on Earth, like we don't have time.\n\n3:56:37.920 --> 3:56:41.120\n We're busy grad students from another planet.\n\n3:56:41.120 --> 3:56:41.960\n I see.\n\n3:56:41.960 --> 3:56:45.480\n What's interesting about human civilization?\n\n3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:47.680\n What's interesting about you?\n\n3:56:47.680 --> 3:56:49.040\n You specifically, too.\n\n3:56:49.040 --> 3:56:51.640\n They could be very kind of personal, kind of pushy.\n\n3:56:53.520 --> 3:56:57.840\n And yeah, how would you begin to describe?\n\n3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:00.400\n Okay, I have one.\n\n3:57:00.400 --> 3:57:03.440\n Because, you know, obviously I self identify\n\n3:57:03.440 --> 3:57:04.680\n as a scientist and a physicist,\n\n3:57:04.680 --> 3:57:06.360\n but intrinsically I feel more like an artist.\n\n3:57:06.360 --> 3:57:07.920\n But it's almost like you're an artist\n\n3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:09.840\n that you don't know what you're painting yet.\n\n3:57:09.840 --> 3:57:12.600\n And I guess I feel like that's humanity,\n\n3:57:12.600 --> 3:57:16.440\n like in some sense, we're creating something\n\n3:57:16.440 --> 3:57:19.560\n I think is profound and potentially very beautiful\n\n3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:20.840\n in existence of the universe.\n\n3:57:20.840 --> 3:57:25.240\n But we're just so, not night, we're just early.\n\n3:57:25.240 --> 3:57:26.880\n We're early, we're young.\n\n3:57:26.880 --> 3:57:28.280\n We don't know what we're doing yet.\n\n3:57:28.280 --> 3:57:30.120\n Yeah, what's with the nuclear weapons?\n\n3:57:30.120 --> 3:57:31.560\n That'd be a question, too.\n\n3:57:31.560 --> 3:57:32.800\n Like what are you guys, why?\n\n3:57:32.800 --> 3:57:34.240\n What are we doing with them?\n\n3:57:34.240 --> 3:57:36.600\n This creativity that you talk, it sounds very nice,\n\n3:57:36.600 --> 3:57:37.760\n but it's, you're seem to be.\n\n3:57:37.760 --> 3:57:39.080\n We're making things that are.\n\n3:57:39.080 --> 3:57:41.560\n Like very destructive and like the rockets,\n\n3:57:41.560 --> 3:57:43.640\n this seems very aggressive.\n\n3:57:43.640 --> 3:57:45.080\n Yeah, I know.\n\n3:57:45.080 --> 3:57:46.920\n This is my blinders on.\n\n3:57:48.320 --> 3:57:49.160\n I don't know.\n\n3:57:49.160 --> 3:57:50.560\n I mean, it goes back to the whole conversation\n\n3:57:50.560 --> 3:57:51.400\n about suffering.\n\n3:57:51.400 --> 3:57:53.920\n I have a hard time regularizing certain aspects\n\n3:57:53.920 --> 3:57:56.600\n of reality into what I wanna envision.\n\n3:57:56.600 --> 3:57:58.280\n And that's obviously problematic.\n\n3:57:58.280 --> 3:58:02.520\n But nuclear power has also given us a lot of good things.\n\n3:58:02.520 --> 3:58:03.880\n So.\n\n3:58:03.880 --> 3:58:06.040\n So both, that's human nature.\n\n3:58:06.040 --> 3:58:08.920\n Both human beings and the technology we create\n\n3:58:08.920 --> 3:58:10.840\n has the capacity for evil and the capacity for good.\n\n3:58:10.840 --> 3:58:12.680\n Yeah, and we can't all be good all the time.\n\n3:58:12.680 --> 3:58:14.560\n I mean, there's like this huge misnomer\n\n3:58:14.560 --> 3:58:17.040\n that you need to be liked by everyone universally.\n\n3:58:17.040 --> 3:58:19.200\n And obviously that's like an ideal,\n\n3:58:19.200 --> 3:58:21.120\n but it's physically impossible.\n\n3:58:21.120 --> 3:58:23.080\n Like you can't get a group of people in a room\n\n3:58:23.080 --> 3:58:25.520\n and have everyone like each other all the time.\n\n3:58:25.520 --> 3:58:28.840\n So I think that kind of tension is actually really important\n\n3:58:29.760 --> 3:58:33.480\n that we have different aesthetics, different goals.\n\n3:58:34.880 --> 3:58:38.960\n And sometimes conflict comes out of that.\n\n3:58:38.960 --> 3:58:41.920\n Speaking of which, do Yuli and Yoshua Bach\n\n3:58:41.920 --> 3:58:43.760\n ever say anything nice to each other?\n\n3:58:43.760 --> 3:58:45.400\n Or is it always conflict?\n\n3:58:45.400 --> 3:58:46.400\n We never have conflict.\n\n3:58:46.400 --> 3:58:50.000\n We argue, but I don't think arguments are bad.\n\n3:58:50.000 --> 3:58:50.840\n It's love.\n\n3:58:50.840 --> 3:58:52.240\n I mean, I think the problem I have,\n\n3:58:52.240 --> 3:58:53.520\n not problem, I think.\n\n3:58:53.520 --> 3:58:54.760\n Here we go.\n\n3:58:54.760 --> 3:58:56.000\n And he's not here to defend himself.\n\n3:58:56.000 --> 3:58:59.680\n No, I just, I don't necessarily understand the,\n\n3:58:59.680 --> 3:59:02.320\n I mean, he's just talking at such a high level.\n\n3:59:02.320 --> 3:59:05.240\n You know, I'm a dimwit, so I'm like, I spend some,\n\n3:59:05.240 --> 3:59:08.080\n so I think a lot of our conflict is not conflict.\n\n3:59:08.080 --> 3:59:10.120\n We actually, we actually have a, I think,\n\n3:59:10.120 --> 3:59:10.960\n I mean, I can't speak for Yash,\n\n3:59:10.960 --> 3:59:13.560\n I have a deep appreciation for him, he's brilliant.\n\n3:59:13.560 --> 3:59:17.520\n But I think I'm kind of frustrated and I'm trying to,\n\n3:59:17.520 --> 3:59:20.800\n he thinks the universe is a computer\n\n3:59:20.800 --> 3:59:23.480\n and I want to turn the universe into a computer.\n\n3:59:23.480 --> 3:59:25.840\n Yeah, that's a small disagreement.\n\n3:59:25.840 --> 3:59:28.040\n So what would you, how would you defend your life\n\n3:59:28.040 --> 3:59:30.400\n to an alien when you're being abducted?\n\n3:59:30.400 --> 3:59:32.880\n Would you focus on the specifics of your life?\n\n3:59:32.880 --> 3:59:34.440\n No, no, no, I would be, I would try to be\n\n3:59:34.440 --> 3:59:37.040\n as random as possible and try and confuse them.\n\n3:59:37.040 --> 3:59:39.520\n Oh, good, good.\n\n3:59:42.560 --> 3:59:43.400\n Excellent.\n\n3:59:43.400 --> 3:59:45.160\n That might be the wiser choice.\n\n3:59:45.160 --> 3:59:46.520\n The Easter eggs in reality.\n\n3:59:46.520 --> 3:59:47.360\n No, I mean, if aliens abducted me.\n\n3:59:47.360 --> 3:59:48.200\n Would you play dumb?\n\n3:59:48.200 --> 3:59:50.480\n No, no, no, I would try and be as random as possible.\n\n3:59:50.480 --> 3:59:52.200\n I would try and do something that would surprise\n\n3:59:52.200 --> 3:59:53.800\n the hell out of them, which I thought,\n\n3:59:53.800 --> 3:59:55.400\n I mean, I'd probably risk it, they might kill me,\n\n3:59:55.400 --> 3:59:56.800\n but I think that'd probably be funny.\n\n3:59:56.800 --> 3:59:59.480\n That might, yeah, they might want to study you\n\n3:59:59.480 --> 4:00:00.360\n for prolonged periods of time.\n\n4:00:00.360 --> 4:00:03.000\n My reasoning is, if I wanted to stay alive, okay,\n\n4:00:03.000 --> 4:00:05.040\n so if the thing is, if I wasn't going back to Earth\n\n4:00:05.040 --> 4:00:07.160\n and the job was to stay alive, if I could be\n\n4:00:07.160 --> 4:00:08.880\n as surprising as possible, they'd keep me around\n\n4:00:08.880 --> 4:00:09.800\n like a pet, right?\n\n4:00:11.600 --> 4:00:13.000\n Petly, on the aliens page book.\n\n4:00:13.000 --> 4:00:14.720\n So you'd be okay being a pet?\n\n4:00:14.720 --> 4:00:15.560\n Well, no, but I mean.\n\n4:00:15.560 --> 4:00:18.440\n The last human that survives would just be\n\n4:00:18.440 --> 4:00:19.560\n a pet to the aliens.\n\n4:00:19.560 --> 4:00:22.720\n I don't know, but I mean, I think that might be fun\n\n4:00:22.720 --> 4:00:25.040\n because then I might get some feedback\n\n4:00:25.040 --> 4:00:26.760\n from their curiosity, but yeah.\n\n4:00:26.760 --> 4:00:28.320\n Let me ask you this question.\n\n4:00:28.320 --> 4:00:31.320\n Given our conversation has a very different meaning,\n\n4:00:31.320 --> 4:00:33.280\n not a more profound meaning, perhaps,\n\n4:00:33.280 --> 4:00:37.240\n but would you rather lose all of your old memories\n\n4:00:37.240 --> 4:00:39.520\n or never be able to make new ones?\n\n4:00:42.280 --> 4:00:46.760\n I would have to lose all my old memories.\n\n4:00:47.640 --> 4:00:49.040\n Again, it's the novelty.\n\n4:00:51.320 --> 4:00:52.320\n What about you, Sarah?\n\n4:00:52.320 --> 4:00:54.480\n I'm the same because I don't think,\n\n4:00:54.480 --> 4:00:56.360\n like, it's about the future experience, right?\n\n4:00:56.360 --> 4:00:59.440\n And in some sense, like you were saying earlier,\n\n4:00:59.440 --> 4:01:01.880\n most of our lived experience is actually in our memories.\n\n4:01:01.880 --> 4:01:04.160\n So if you can't generate new memories,\n\n4:01:04.160 --> 4:01:06.400\n it's like you're not alive anymore.\n\n4:01:06.400 --> 4:01:07.960\n That's it, yeah.\n\n4:01:07.960 --> 4:01:10.280\n What comforts you on bad days?\n\n4:01:10.280 --> 4:01:11.960\n When you look at human civilization,\n\n4:01:11.960 --> 4:01:14.120\n when you look at your own life,\n\n4:01:14.120 --> 4:01:15.440\n what gives you hope?\n\n4:01:15.440 --> 4:01:18.640\n What makes you feel good about what we're doing\n\n4:01:18.640 --> 4:01:21.440\n about life at the small scale of you as a human\n\n4:01:21.440 --> 4:01:24.440\n and at the big scale of us as a human civilization,\n\n4:01:24.440 --> 4:01:26.440\n maybe the big scale of the universe?\n\n4:01:29.200 --> 4:01:30.440\n Children, my kids.\n\n4:01:30.440 --> 4:01:33.840\n But I also mean that in like a grand sense of like,\n\n4:01:33.840 --> 4:01:38.040\n not a grand, but like future minds in some sense.\n\n4:01:38.040 --> 4:01:40.680\n So for me, like the most bleak movie ever,\n\n4:01:40.680 --> 4:01:42.280\n people worry about apocalyptic things\n\n4:01:42.280 --> 4:01:44.440\n like AI existential risk and climate change,\n\n4:01:44.440 --> 4:01:46.200\n which children of men.\n\n4:01:46.200 --> 4:01:48.000\n The whole premise of the movie was\n\n4:01:48.000 --> 4:01:50.680\n there can be no children born on the entire planet.\n\n4:01:50.680 --> 4:01:52.360\n And the youngest person on the planet\n\n4:01:52.360 --> 4:01:54.720\n is like 18 years old or something.\n\n4:01:54.720 --> 4:01:56.720\n Like, can you imagine a world without children?\n\n4:01:56.720 --> 4:01:58.960\n It's just, it's harrowing.\n\n4:01:58.960 --> 4:02:00.080\n That's the scariest thing.\n\n4:02:00.080 --> 4:02:03.680\n So I think what gives me hope is always youth\n\n4:02:03.680 --> 4:02:07.080\n and the hope of children\n\n4:02:07.080 --> 4:02:10.000\n and the possibilities of the future they see.\n\n4:02:10.000 --> 4:02:12.280\n And they grow up in a completely different reality\n\n4:02:12.280 --> 4:02:13.320\n than adults do.\n\n4:02:14.320 --> 4:02:17.440\n And I think we have a hard time seeing\n\n4:02:17.440 --> 4:02:19.560\n what their reality actually looks like.\n\n4:02:19.560 --> 4:02:23.520\n But I think most of the time it's super interesting.\n\n4:02:23.520 --> 4:02:26.280\n Yeah, they have dreams, they have imagination,\n\n4:02:26.280 --> 4:02:27.800\n they have this kind of excitement.\n\n4:02:27.800 --> 4:02:30.560\n It's so cool, it's so fun to watch.\n\n4:02:31.480 --> 4:02:36.040\n And yeah, you feel like you're almost getting in the way\n\n4:02:36.040 --> 4:02:38.760\n of all that imagination.\n\n4:02:38.760 --> 4:02:39.800\n What about you, Lee?\n\n4:02:39.800 --> 4:02:41.160\n What gives you hope?\n\n4:02:41.160 --> 4:02:44.680\n So when I go back to my eight year old self,\n\n4:02:44.680 --> 4:02:46.560\n the thing that I dreamed of as my eight year old self\n\n4:02:46.560 --> 4:02:49.560\n was this world in which technology became programmable\n\n4:02:49.560 --> 4:02:52.440\n and there was the internet and I'd get information\n\n4:02:52.440 --> 4:02:54.920\n and I would expand my consciousness by just,\n\n4:02:54.920 --> 4:02:59.920\n you know, getting access to everything that was going on.\n\n4:03:00.120 --> 4:03:01.840\n And this happened in my lifetime.\n\n4:03:01.840 --> 4:03:02.840\n I mean, we really do have that.\n\n4:03:02.840 --> 4:03:04.120\n I mean, okay, there's some bad things.\n\n4:03:04.120 --> 4:03:06.640\n You know, there's TikTok, everyone just, whatever,\n\n4:03:06.640 --> 4:03:08.040\n all the bad things about social media.\n\n4:03:08.040 --> 4:03:09.440\n But I think,\n\n4:03:12.400 --> 4:03:16.760\n I mean, I can't quite believe my luck being born now.\n\n4:03:16.760 --> 4:03:18.120\n So amazing.\n\n4:03:18.120 --> 4:03:20.240\n Being able to program reality in some way.\n\n4:03:20.240 --> 4:03:22.920\n Yeah, and the thing that I really find fascinating\n\n4:03:22.920 --> 4:03:27.720\n about human beings is just how ingenious they are.\n\n4:03:27.720 --> 4:03:31.120\n I'm, you know, whether it's from my kids,\n\n4:03:31.120 --> 4:03:34.760\n my research group, my peers, other companies,\n\n4:03:34.760 --> 4:03:37.360\n just how ingenious everyone is.\n\n4:03:37.360 --> 4:03:40.160\n And I'm pretty sure humanity has,\n\n4:03:40.160 --> 4:03:44.160\n or our causal chain in which humanity is a vital part\n\n4:03:44.160 --> 4:03:46.480\n in the future is gonna have a lot of fun.\n\n4:03:46.480 --> 4:03:50.040\n And I'm just, yeah, it's just mind blowing just to watch.\n\n4:03:50.040 --> 4:03:53.480\n And, you know, so humans are ingenious\n\n4:03:53.480 --> 4:03:56.840\n and I hope to help them be more ingenious if I can.\n\n4:03:56.840 --> 4:03:58.160\n Well, what gives me hope,\n\n4:03:58.160 --> 4:03:59.960\n what makes me feel good on bad days\n\n4:03:59.960 --> 4:04:04.200\n is the existence of wild minds like yours,\n\n4:04:04.200 --> 4:04:07.160\n novelty generators, assembly structures\n\n4:04:07.160 --> 4:04:10.520\n that generate novelty and do so beautifully\n\n4:04:10.520 --> 4:04:12.520\n and then tweet about it.\n\n4:04:12.520 --> 4:04:15.200\n Sarah, I really, really enjoy talking to you.\n\n4:04:15.200 --> 4:04:16.040\n I enjoy following you.\n\n4:04:16.040 --> 4:04:17.440\n I'm a huge fan.\n\n4:04:17.440 --> 4:04:20.000\n Sarah Lee, I hope to talk to you many times\n\n4:04:20.000 --> 4:04:21.680\n in the future, maybe with Yoshua Bach.\n\n4:04:21.680 --> 4:04:22.800\n You're just incredible people.\n\n4:04:22.800 --> 4:04:24.000\n Thank you for everything you do.\n\n4:04:24.000 --> 4:04:24.960\n You're awesome.\n\n4:04:24.960 --> 4:04:26.000\n Thank you for talking today.\n\n4:04:26.000 --> 4:04:27.400\n Really, really appreciate it.\n\n4:04:27.400 --> 4:04:28.840\n Yeah, brilliant to be here.\n\n4:04:29.760 --> 4:04:31.240\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n4:04:31.240 --> 4:04:33.080\n with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.\n\n4:04:33.080 --> 4:04:34.400\n To support this podcast,\n\n4:04:34.400 --> 4:04:37.320\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n4:04:37.320 --> 4:04:41.160\n Now, let me leave you with some words from Arthur C. Clarke.\n\n4:04:41.160 --> 4:04:43.440\n Two possibilities exist.\n\n4:04:43.440 --> 4:04:48.440\n Either we are alone in the universe or we are not.\n\n4:04:48.440 --> 4:04:50.880\n Both are equally terrifying.\n\n4:04:52.200 --> 4:04:55.600\n And let me, if I may, add to that\n\n4:04:55.600 --> 4:04:58.680\n by saying that both possibilities, at least to me,\n\n4:04:58.680 --> 4:05:00.920\n are both terrifying and exciting.\n\n4:05:00.920 --> 4:05:03.160\n And keeping these two feelings in my heart\n\n4:05:03.160 --> 4:05:07.280\n is a fun way to explore, to wonder, to think, and to live,\n\n4:05:07.280 --> 4:05:10.280\n always a little bit on the edge of madness.\n\n4:05:10.280 --> 4:05:11.400\n Thank you for listening.\n\n4:05:11.400 --> 4:05:22.080\n I hope to see you next time.\n\n"
