thousand books in 50 years.\n\n00:05.200 --> 00:07.160\n All of the components are there\n\n00:07.160 --> 00:09.480\n to engineer intimate experiences.\n\n00:09.480 --> 00:11.560\n Extraterrestrial life is a true mystery,\n\n00:11.560 --> 00:13.360\n the most tantalizing mystery of all.\n\n00:13.360 --> 00:15.880\n How many humans need to disappear\n\n00:15.880 --> 00:17.660\n for us to be completely lost?\n\n00:19.840 --> 00:22.320\n The following is a conversation with Tim Urban,\n\n00:22.320 --> 00:25.480\n author and illustrator of the amazing blog\n\n00:25.480 --> 00:28.040\n called Wait, But Why?\n\n00:28.040 --> 00:30.080\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:30.080 --> 00:32.200\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:32.200 --> 00:33.320\n in the description.\n\n00:33.320 --> 00:37.280\n And now, dear friends, here's Tim Urban.\n\n00:38.280 --> 00:41.160\n You wrote a Wait, But Why blog post\n\n00:41.160 --> 00:42.680\n about the big and the small,\n\n00:42.680 --> 00:45.640\n from the observable universe to the atom.\n\n00:45.640 --> 00:48.500\n What world do you find most mysterious or beautiful,\n\n00:48.500 --> 00:50.660\n the very big or the very small?\n\n00:50.660 --> 00:54.080\n The very small seems a lot more mysterious.\n\n00:54.080 --> 00:56.600\n And I mean, the very big I feel like we kind of understand.\n\n00:56.600 --> 00:58.000\n I mean, not the very, very big.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:01.760\n Not the multiverse, if there is a multiverse,\n\n01:01.760 --> 01:04.160\n not anything outside of the observable universe.\n\n01:05.280 --> 01:07.040\n But the very small,\n\n01:07.040 --> 01:09.560\n I think we really have no idea what's going on,\n\n01:09.560 --> 01:11.240\n or very much less idea.\n\n01:11.240 --> 01:12.080\n But I find that,\n\n01:12.080 --> 01:13.640\n so I think the small is more mysterious,\n\n01:13.640 --> 01:16.200\n but I think the big is sexier.\n\n01:17.320 --> 01:22.320\n I just cannot get enough of the bigness of space\n\n01:23.580 --> 01:26.300\n and the farness of stars.\n\n01:26.300 --> 01:29.200\n And it just continually blows my mind.\n\n01:29.200 --> 01:30.040\n I mean, we still,\n\n01:30.040 --> 01:33.440\n the vastness of the observable universe\n\n01:33.440 --> 01:35.800\n has the mystery that we don't know what's out there.\n\n01:35.800 --> 01:38.240\n We know how it works, perhaps.\n\n01:38.240 --> 01:40.880\n Like, general relativity can tell us\n\n01:40.880 --> 01:42.780\n how the movement of bodies works,\n\n01:42.780 --> 01:45.360\n how they're born, all that kind of things.\n\n01:45.360 --> 01:49.240\n But like, how many civilizations are out there?\n\n01:49.240 --> 01:51.400\n How many, like, what are the weird things that are out there?\n\n01:51.400 --> 01:52.240\n Oh yeah, life.\n\n01:52.240 --> 01:54.680\n Well, extraterrestrial life is a true mystery.\n\n01:54.680 --> 01:56.720\n The most tantalizing mystery of all.\n\n01:58.400 --> 02:00.080\n But that's like our size.\n\n02:00.080 --> 02:02.660\n So that's maybe it's that the actual,\n\n02:02.660 --> 02:04.080\n the big and the small are really cool,\n\n02:04.080 --> 02:06.440\n but it's actually the things that are potentially our size\n\n02:06.440 --> 02:07.720\n that are the most tantalizing.\n\n02:07.720 --> 02:10.160\n Potentially our size is probably the key word.\n\n02:10.160 --> 02:11.000\n Yeah, I mean,\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.420\n I wonder how small intelligent life could get.\n\n02:13.420 --> 02:15.400\n Probably not that small.\n\n02:15.400 --> 02:18.360\n And I assume that there's a limit that you're not gonna,\n\n02:18.360 --> 02:19.920\n I mean, you might have like a whale,\n\n02:19.920 --> 02:21.840\n blue whale size intelligent being,\n\n02:21.840 --> 02:23.340\n that would be kind of cool.\n\n02:23.340 --> 02:27.120\n But I feel like we're in the range of order of magnitude\n\n02:27.120 --> 02:28.720\n smaller and bigger than us for life.\n\n02:28.720 --> 02:29.600\n But maybe not.\n\n02:29.600 --> 02:32.200\n Maybe you could have some giant life form.\n\n02:32.200 --> 02:34.000\n Just seems like, I don't know,\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.640\n there's gotta be some reason that anything intelligent\n\n02:36.640 --> 02:39.240\n between kind of like a little tiny rodent\n\n02:39.240 --> 02:43.640\n or finger monkey up to a blue whale on this planet.\n\n02:43.640 --> 02:44.480\n I don't know.\n\n02:44.480 --> 02:47.720\n Maybe when you change the gravity and other things.\n\n02:47.720 --> 02:49.120\n Well, you could think of life\n\n02:49.120 --> 02:52.520\n as a thing of self assembling organisms\n\n02:52.520 --> 02:54.000\n and they just get bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:55.920\n Like there's no such thing as a human being.\n\n02:55.920 --> 02:58.920\n A human being is made up of a bunch of tiny organisms\n\n02:58.920 --> 03:00.080\n working together.\n\n03:00.080 --> 03:03.040\n And we somehow envision that as one entity\n\n03:03.040 --> 03:04.560\n because it has consciousness.\n\n03:04.560 --> 03:08.060\n But maybe it's just organisms on top of organisms.\n\n03:08.060 --> 03:10.600\n Organisms all the way down, turtles all the way down.\n\n03:10.600 --> 03:13.320\n So like earth can be seen as an organism\n\n03:13.320 --> 03:17.400\n for people, for alien species that's very different.\n\n03:18.240 --> 03:21.500\n Like why is the human the fundamental entity\n\n03:21.500 --> 03:24.980\n that is living and then everything else\n\n03:24.980 --> 03:26.720\n is just either a collection of humans\n\n03:26.720 --> 03:28.560\n or components of humans?\n\n03:28.560 --> 03:30.360\n I think if it kind of is, if you think about,\n\n03:30.360 --> 03:32.600\n I think of like an emergence elevator.\n\n03:32.600 --> 03:36.760\n And so you've got an ant is on one floor\n\n03:36.760 --> 03:39.560\n and then the ant colony is a floor above.\n\n03:39.560 --> 03:41.280\n Or maybe there's even units within the colony\n\n03:41.280 --> 03:42.880\n that's one floor above and the full colony\n\n03:42.880 --> 03:44.640\n is two floors above.\n\n03:44.640 --> 03:46.940\n And to me, I think that it's the colony\n\n03:46.940 --> 03:49.400\n that is closest to being the animal.\n\n03:49.400 --> 03:53.880\n It's like the individual thing that competes with others\n\n03:53.880 --> 03:57.640\n while the individual ants are like cells\n\n03:57.640 --> 03:59.040\n in the animal's body.\n\n03:59.040 --> 04:01.320\n We are more like a colony in that regard.\n\n04:01.320 --> 04:04.660\n But the humans are weird because we kind of,\n\n04:04.660 --> 04:08.240\n I think of it, if emergence happens in an emergence tower,\n\n04:08.240 --> 04:09.560\n where you've got kind of, as I said,\n\n04:09.560 --> 04:13.320\n cells and then humans and communities and societies.\n\n04:13.320 --> 04:15.040\n Ants are very specific.\n\n04:15.040 --> 04:16.920\n The individual ants are always cooperating\n\n04:16.920 --> 04:19.240\n with each other for the sake of the colony.\n\n04:19.240 --> 04:22.680\n So the colony is this unit that is the competitive unit.\n\n04:22.680 --> 04:24.200\n Humans can kind of go,\n\n04:24.200 --> 04:25.840\n we take the elevator up and down\n\n04:25.840 --> 04:27.240\n emergence tower psychologically.\n\n04:27.240 --> 04:29.000\n Sometimes we are individuals\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.840\n that are competing with other individuals\n\n04:31.840 --> 04:33.140\n and that's where our mindset is.\n\n04:33.140 --> 04:35.640\n And then other times we get in this crazy zone,\n\n04:35.640 --> 04:37.460\n you know, a protest or a sporting event\n\n04:37.460 --> 04:40.120\n and you're just chanting and screaming\n\n04:40.120 --> 04:41.240\n and doing the same hand motions\n\n04:41.240 --> 04:43.800\n with all these other people and you feel like one.\n\n04:43.800 --> 04:45.720\n You feel like one, you know, and you'd sacrifice yourself.\n\n04:45.720 --> 04:46.920\n And now that's what, you know, soldiers.\n\n04:46.920 --> 04:50.480\n And so our brains can kind of psychologically\n\n04:50.480 --> 04:53.600\n go up and down this elevator in an interesting way.\n\n04:53.600 --> 04:55.320\n Yeah, I wonder how much of that\n\n04:55.320 --> 04:57.080\n is just the narrative we tell ourselves.\n\n04:57.080 --> 04:59.040\n Maybe we are just like an ant colony.\n\n04:59.040 --> 05:00.560\n We're just collaborating always,\n\n05:00.560 --> 05:04.160\n even in our stories of individualism,\n\n05:04.160 --> 05:05.800\n of like the freedom of the individual,\n\n05:05.800 --> 05:09.080\n like this kind of isolation,\n\n05:09.080 --> 05:11.360\n lone man on an island kind of thing.\n\n05:11.360 --> 05:13.820\n We're actually all part of this giant network\n\n05:13.820 --> 05:17.560\n of maybe one of the things that makes humans who we are\n\n05:17.560 --> 05:21.120\n is probably deeply social,\n\n05:21.120 --> 05:22.560\n the ability to maintain\n\n05:22.560 --> 05:24.480\n not just the single human intelligence,\n\n05:24.480 --> 05:26.560\n but like a collective intelligence.\n\n05:26.560 --> 05:29.440\n And so this feeling like individual\n\n05:29.440 --> 05:33.080\n is just because we woke up at this level of the hierarchy.\n\n05:33.080 --> 05:34.600\n So we make it special,\n\n05:34.600 --> 05:39.600\n but we very well could be just part of the ant colony.\n\n05:39.760 --> 05:40.840\n This whole conversation,\n\n05:40.840 --> 05:44.000\n I'm either going to be doing a Shakespearean analysis\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:46.480\n of your Twitter, your writing,\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:49.560\n or very specific statements that you've made.\n\n05:49.560 --> 05:54.560\n So you've written answers to a mailbag of questions.\n\n05:54.960 --> 05:57.080\n The questions were amazing, the ones you've chosen,\n\n05:57.080 --> 05:58.640\n and your answers were amazing.\n\n05:58.640 --> 06:00.200\n So on this topic of the big and the small,\n\n06:00.200 --> 06:03.480\n somebody asked, are we bigger than we are small?\n\n06:03.480 --> 06:05.000\n Or smaller than we are big?\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:06.400\n Who's asking these questions?\n\n06:06.400 --> 06:08.000\n This is really good.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.160\n You have amazing fans.\n\n06:09.160 --> 06:14.160\n Okay, so where do we sit at this level\n\n06:15.800 --> 06:18.480\n of the very small to the very big?\n\n06:18.480 --> 06:20.040\n So are we bigger or are we small?\n\n06:20.040 --> 06:21.560\n Are we bigger than we are small?\n\n06:21.560 --> 06:23.840\n I think it depends on what we're asking here.\n\n06:23.840 --> 06:26.800\n So if we're talking about the biggest thing\n\n06:26.800 --> 06:31.800\n that we kind of can talk about without just imagining\n\n06:31.840 --> 06:34.320\n is the observable universe, the Hubble sphere.\n\n06:34.320 --> 06:39.320\n And that's about 10 to the 26th meters in diameter.\n\n06:41.800 --> 06:44.480\n The smallest thing we talk about is a plank length,\n\n06:44.480 --> 06:47.240\n but you could argue that that's kind of an imaginary thing.\n\n06:47.240 --> 06:49.480\n But that's 10 to the negative 35.\n\n06:49.480 --> 06:52.560\n Now we're about, conveniently, about 10 to the one.\n\n06:52.560 --> 06:53.880\n Not quite, 10 to the zero.\n\n06:53.880 --> 06:56.960\n We're about 10 to the zero meters long.\n\n06:56.960 --> 06:59.120\n So it's easy because you can just look and say,\n\n06:59.120 --> 07:03.600\n okay, well, for example, atoms are like 10\n\n07:03.600 --> 07:07.080\n to the negative 15th or 10 to the negative 16th meters\n\n07:07.080 --> 07:08.600\n across, right?\n\n07:08.600 --> 07:10.640\n If you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 16th,\n\n07:10.640 --> 07:12.040\n which is right, that's now.\n\n07:12.040 --> 07:13.920\n So an atom to us is us to this.\n\n07:13.920 --> 07:16.720\n You get to like nebulas, smaller than a galaxy\n\n07:16.720 --> 07:18.560\n and bigger than the biggest star.\n\n07:18.560 --> 07:22.800\n So we're right in between nebula and an atom.\n\n07:22.800 --> 07:24.160\n Now, if you wanna go down to quark level,\n\n07:24.160 --> 07:26.320\n you might be able to get up to galaxy level.\n\n07:27.600 --> 07:29.320\n When you go up to the observable universe,\n\n07:29.320 --> 07:31.520\n you're getting down on the small side\n\n07:31.520 --> 07:35.640\n to things that we, I think, are mostly theoretically\n\n07:35.640 --> 07:39.800\n imagining are there and hypothesizing are there.\n\n07:39.800 --> 07:43.400\n So I think as far as real world objects\n\n07:43.400 --> 07:45.320\n that we really know a lot about,\n\n07:45.320 --> 07:48.840\n I would say we are smaller than we are big.\n\n07:48.840 --> 07:50.360\n But if you wanna go down to the Planck length,\n\n07:50.360 --> 07:52.600\n we're very quickly, we're bigger than we are small.\n\n07:52.600 --> 07:54.120\n If you think about strings.\n\n07:54.120 --> 07:57.640\n Yeah, strings, exactly, string theory and so on.\n\n07:57.640 --> 07:58.640\n That's interesting.\n\n07:58.640 --> 08:00.200\n But I think like you answered,\n\n08:00.200 --> 08:02.040\n no matter what, we're kind of middleish.\n\n08:02.040 --> 08:04.360\n Yeah, I mean, here's something cool.\n\n08:04.360 --> 08:06.840\n If a human is a neutrino, and again, neutrino,\n\n08:06.840 --> 08:08.560\n the size doesn't really make sense.\n\n08:08.560 --> 08:09.640\n It's not really a size.\n\n08:09.640 --> 08:11.640\n But when we talk about some of these neutrinos,\n\n08:11.640 --> 08:15.480\n I mean, if a neutrino is a human, a proton is the sun.\n\n08:15.480 --> 08:18.680\n So that's like, I mean, a proton is real small,\n\n08:18.680 --> 08:19.720\n like really small.\n\n08:20.680 --> 08:25.680\n And so, yeah, the small gets like crazy small very quickly.\n\n08:25.680 --> 08:29.400\n Let's talk about aliens.\n\n08:30.440 --> 08:31.640\n We already mentioned it.\n\n08:32.800 --> 08:34.200\n Let's start just by with the basic,\n\n08:34.200 --> 08:36.040\n what's your intuition as of today?\n\n08:36.040 --> 08:38.400\n This is a thing that could change day by day.\n\n08:38.400 --> 08:40.920\n But how many alien civilizations out there?\n\n08:40.920 --> 08:42.360\n Is it zero?\n\n08:42.360 --> 08:45.200\n Is it a handful?\n\n08:45.200 --> 08:50.200\n Is it almost endless, like the observable universe\n\n08:50.280 --> 08:52.240\n or the universe is teeming with life?\n\n08:52.240 --> 08:54.800\n If I had gun to my head, I have to take a guess.\n\n08:54.800 --> 08:56.360\n I would say it's teeming with life.\n\n08:56.360 --> 08:57.720\n I would say there is.\n\n08:57.720 --> 09:00.720\n I think running a Monte Carlo simulation,\n\n09:00.720 --> 09:03.960\n this paper by Andrew Sandberg and Drexler\n\n09:03.960 --> 09:05.720\n and a few others a couple of years ago,\n\n09:05.720 --> 09:07.280\n I think you probably know about it.\n\n09:07.280 --> 09:10.080\n I think the mean,\n\n09:12.280 --> 09:13.280\n using different,\n\n09:16.040 --> 09:20.240\n running through randomized rake equation multiplication,\n\n09:20.240 --> 09:23.560\n you're ended up with 27 million as the mean\n\n09:23.560 --> 09:26.480\n of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy,\n\n09:26.480 --> 09:27.840\n in the Milky Way alone.\n\n09:29.040 --> 09:30.640\n And so then if you go outside the Milky Way,\n\n09:30.640 --> 09:32.280\n that would turn into trillions.\n\n09:32.280 --> 09:34.280\n That's the mean.\n\n09:34.280 --> 09:37.000\n Now, what's interesting is that there's a long tail\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.040\n because they believe some of these multipliers\n\n09:40.040 --> 09:40.880\n in the Drake equation.\n\n09:40.880 --> 09:45.600\n So for example, the probability that life starts\n\n09:45.600 --> 09:46.960\n in the first place,\n\n09:46.960 --> 09:51.960\n they think that the kind of range that we use\n\n09:51.960 --> 09:54.480\n is for that variable or is way too small.\n\n09:54.480 --> 09:57.640\n And that's constraining our possibilities.\n\n09:57.640 --> 10:00.960\n And if you actually extend it to some crazy number\n\n10:00.960 --> 10:03.080\n of orders of magnitude, like 200,\n\n10:03.080 --> 10:05.400\n they think that that variable should be,\n\n10:06.800 --> 10:08.640\n you get this long tail where,\n\n10:08.640 --> 10:09.480\n I forget the exact number,\n\n10:09.480 --> 10:11.400\n but it's like a third or a quarter\n\n10:11.400 --> 10:14.960\n of the total outcomes have us alone.\n\n10:14.960 --> 10:18.920\n I think it's a sizable percentage has us\n\n10:18.920 --> 10:22.200\n as the only intelligent life in the galaxy,\n\n10:22.200 --> 10:23.040\n but you can keep going.\n\n10:23.040 --> 10:25.680\n And I think there's like a non zero,\n\n10:25.680 --> 10:28.160\n like legitimate amount of outcomes there\n\n10:28.160 --> 10:30.120\n that have us as the only life\n\n10:30.120 --> 10:32.640\n in the observable universe at all is on earth.\n\n10:32.640 --> 10:35.400\n I mean, it seems incredibly counterintuitive.\n\n10:35.400 --> 10:37.960\n It seems like, you mentioned that people think\n\n10:37.960 --> 10:41.440\n you must be an idiot because if you picked up one grain\n\n10:41.440 --> 10:42.960\n of sand on a beach and examined it\n\n10:42.960 --> 10:44.280\n and you found all these little things on it,\n\n10:44.280 --> 10:46.600\n it's like saying, well, maybe this is the only one\n\n10:46.600 --> 10:47.440\n that has that.\n\n10:47.440 --> 10:48.760\n And it's like, probably not.\n\n10:48.760 --> 10:50.840\n They're probably most of the sand probably\n\n10:50.840 --> 10:52.320\n or a lot of the sand, right?\n\n10:52.320 --> 10:54.520\n So, and then the other hand, we don't see anything.\n\n10:54.520 --> 10:56.680\n We don't see any evidence, which of course,\n\n10:56.680 --> 10:59.280\n people would say that the people who stuff scoff\n\n10:59.280 --> 11:01.600\n at the concept that we're potentially alone,\n\n11:03.200 --> 11:05.400\n they say, well, of course, there's lots of reasons\n\n11:05.400 --> 11:06.600\n we wouldn't have seen anything.\n\n11:06.600 --> 11:09.960\n And they can go list them and they're very compelling,\n\n11:09.960 --> 11:11.800\n but we don't know.\n\n11:11.800 --> 11:12.960\n And the truth is if there were,\n\n11:12.960 --> 11:14.640\n if this were a freak thing, I mean, we don't,\n\n11:14.640 --> 11:17.720\n if this were a completely freak thing that happened here,\n\n11:17.720 --> 11:19.600\n whether it's life at all or just getting\n\n11:19.600 --> 11:21.040\n to this level of intelligence,\n\n11:23.200 --> 11:25.680\n that species, whoever it was, would think\n\n11:25.680 --> 11:28.320\n there must be lots of us out there and they'd be wrong.\n\n11:28.320 --> 11:30.760\n So just being, again, using the same intuition\n\n11:30.760 --> 11:32.760\n that most people would use, I'd say there's probably lots\n\n11:32.760 --> 11:34.400\n of other things out there.\n\n11:34.400 --> 11:36.640\n Yeah, and you wrote a great blog post about it.\n\n11:36.640 --> 11:40.480\n But to me, the two interesting reasons\n\n11:40.480 --> 11:44.920\n that we haven't been in contact, I too have an intuition\n\n11:44.920 --> 11:47.600\n that the universe is teeming with life.\n\n11:47.600 --> 11:50.720\n So one interesting is around the great filter.\n\n11:50.720 --> 11:54.120\n So we either, the great filter's either behind us\n\n11:54.120 --> 11:55.240\n or in front of us.\n\n11:55.240 --> 11:58.200\n So the reason that's interesting is you get to think\n\n11:58.200 --> 12:01.520\n about what kind of things ensure\n\n12:01.520 --> 12:05.920\n or ensure the survival of an intelligent civilization\n\n12:05.920 --> 12:08.480\n or lead to the destruction of intelligent civilization.\n\n12:08.480 --> 12:10.560\n That's a very pragmatic, very important question\n\n12:10.560 --> 12:11.880\n to always be asking.\n\n12:11.880 --> 12:13.400\n And we'll talk about some of those.\n\n12:13.400 --> 12:18.400\n And then the other one is I'm saddened by the possibility\n\n12:18.480 --> 12:20.320\n that there could be aliens communicating\n\n12:20.320 --> 12:21.660\n with us all the time.\n\n12:21.660 --> 12:23.700\n In fact, they may have visited.\n\n12:25.160 --> 12:29.620\n And we're just too dumb to hear it, to see it.\n\n12:29.620 --> 12:34.540\n Like the idea that the kind of life that can evolve\n\n12:34.540 --> 12:38.120\n is just the range of life that can evolve is so large\n\n12:38.120 --> 12:41.480\n that our narrow view of what is life\n\n12:41.480 --> 12:43.680\n and what is intelligent life is preventing us\n\n12:43.680 --> 12:45.800\n from having communication with them.\n\n12:45.800 --> 12:47.720\n But then they don't seem very smart\n\n12:47.720 --> 12:50.400\n because if they were trying to communicate with us,\n\n12:50.400 --> 12:53.400\n they would surely, if they were super intelligent,\n\n12:53.400 --> 12:56.440\n they would be very, I'm sure if there's lots of life,\n\n12:56.440 --> 12:59.360\n we're not that rare, we're not some crazy weird species\n\n12:59.360 --> 13:01.920\n that hears and has different kinds of ways\n\n13:01.920 --> 13:04.640\n of perceiving signals.\n\n13:04.640 --> 13:06.960\n So they would probably be able to,\n\n13:06.960 --> 13:08.160\n if you really wanted to communicate\n\n13:08.160 --> 13:11.220\n with an earth like species, with a human like species,\n\n13:12.080 --> 13:14.120\n you would send out all kinds of things.\n\n13:14.120 --> 13:18.820\n You'd send out radio waves and you send out gravity waves\n\n13:18.820 --> 13:20.720\n and lots of things.\n\n13:20.720 --> 13:22.160\n So if they're communicating in a way,\n\n13:22.160 --> 13:23.880\n they're trying to communicate with us\n\n13:23.880 --> 13:25.980\n and it's just we're too dumb to perceive the signals,\n\n13:25.980 --> 13:28.380\n it's like, well, they're not doing a great job\n\n13:28.380 --> 13:32.800\n of considering the primitive species we might be.\n\n13:32.800 --> 13:35.840\n So I don't know, I think if a super intelligent species\n\n13:35.840 --> 13:40.840\n wanted to get in touch with us and had the capability of,\n\n13:40.880 --> 13:43.560\n I think probably they would.\n\n13:43.560 --> 13:48.560\n Well, they may be getting in touch with us,\n\n13:48.640 --> 13:50.100\n they're just getting in touch with the thing\n\n13:50.100 --> 13:52.240\n that we humans are not understanding\n\n13:52.240 --> 13:53.780\n that they're getting in touch with us with.\n\n13:53.780 --> 13:55.960\n I guess that's what I was trying to say is\n\n13:55.960 --> 13:57.560\n there could be something about earth\n\n13:57.560 --> 14:00.240\n that's much more special than us humans.\n\n14:00.240 --> 14:02.680\n Like the nature of the intelligence that's on earth\n\n14:02.680 --> 14:07.600\n or the thing that's of value and that's curious\n\n14:07.600 --> 14:10.640\n and that's complicated and fascinating and beautiful\n\n14:10.640 --> 14:15.280\n might be something that's not just like tweets, okay?\n\n14:15.280 --> 14:17.200\n Like English language that's interpretable\n\n14:17.200 --> 14:19.720\n or any kind of language or any kind of signal,\n\n14:19.720 --> 14:22.360\n whether it's gravity or radio signal\n\n14:22.360 --> 14:24.920\n that humans seem to appreciate.\n\n14:24.920 --> 14:28.520\n Why not the actual, it could be the process\n\n14:28.520 --> 14:29.560\n of evolution itself.\n\n14:29.560 --> 14:31.120\n There could be something about the way\n\n14:31.120 --> 14:33.280\n that earth is breathing essentially\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:34.660\n through the creation of life\n\n14:34.660 --> 14:37.320\n and this complex growth of life.\n\n14:37.320 --> 14:40.400\n There's like, it's a whole different way\n\n14:40.400 --> 14:42.920\n to view organisms and view life\n\n14:42.920 --> 14:44.920\n that could be getting communicated with.\n\n14:44.920 --> 14:47.140\n And we humans are just a tiny fingertip\n\n14:47.140 --> 14:49.000\n on top of that intelligence.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:50.560\n And the communication is happening\n\n14:50.560 --> 14:54.360\n with the main mothership of earth\n\n14:54.360 --> 14:56.880\n versus us humans that seem to treat ourselves\n\n14:56.880 --> 15:00.480\n as super important and we're missing the big picture.\n\n15:00.480 --> 15:03.760\n I mean, it sounds crazy, but our understanding\n\n15:03.760 --> 15:05.760\n of what is intelligent, of what is life,\n\n15:05.760 --> 15:08.040\n what is consciousness is very limited.\n\n15:08.040 --> 15:11.840\n And it seems to be, and just being very suspicious,\n\n15:11.840 --> 15:14.380\n it seems to be awfully human centric.\n\n15:14.380 --> 15:17.860\n Like this story, it seems like the progress of science\n\n15:17.860 --> 15:22.860\n is constantly putting humans down on the importance,\n\n15:22.860 --> 15:27.860\n humans down on the cosmic importance,\n\n15:28.240 --> 15:32.120\n the ranking of how big we are, how important we are.\n\n15:32.120 --> 15:33.960\n That seems to be the more we discover\n\n15:33.960 --> 15:34.900\n that's what's happening.\n\n15:34.900 --> 15:37.320\n And I think science is very young.\n\n15:37.320 --> 15:39.840\n And so I think eventually we might figure out\n\n15:39.840 --> 15:41.920\n that there's something much, much bigger going on,\n\n15:41.920 --> 15:45.080\n that humans are just a curious little side effect\n\n15:45.080 --> 15:46.440\n of the much bigger thing.\n\n15:46.440 --> 15:49.320\n That's what, I mean, that, as I'm saying,\n\n15:49.320 --> 15:50.680\n it just sounds insane, but.\n\n15:50.680 --> 15:54.240\n Well, it just, it sounds a little like religious.\n\n15:54.240 --> 15:59.080\n It sounds like a spiritual, it gets to that realm\n\n15:59.080 --> 16:02.000\n where there's something that more than meets the eye.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:07.000\n Well, yeah, but not, so religious and spiritual,\n\n16:07.560 --> 16:11.120\n often have this kind of whoo whoo characteristic,\n\n16:11.120 --> 16:12.940\n like when people write books about them,\n\n16:12.940 --> 16:14.620\n then go to wars over whatever the heck\n\n16:14.620 --> 16:16.200\n is written in those books.\n\n16:16.200 --> 16:19.860\n I mean, more like it's possible that collective intelligence\n\n16:19.860 --> 16:22.360\n is more important than individual intelligence, right?\n\n16:22.360 --> 16:23.480\n It's the ant colony.\n\n16:23.480 --> 16:24.840\n What's the primal organism?\n\n16:24.840 --> 16:26.920\n Is it the ant colony or is it the ant?\n\n16:26.920 --> 16:29.640\n Yeah, I mean, humans, just like any individual ant\n\n16:29.640 --> 16:32.120\n can't do shit, but the colony can do,\n\n16:32.120 --> 16:35.440\n make this incredible structures and has this intelligence.\n\n16:35.440 --> 16:36.840\n And we're exactly the same.\n\n16:36.840 --> 16:40.240\n I mean, you know the famous thing that no one,\n\n16:40.240 --> 16:42.480\n no human knows how to make a pencil.\n\n16:43.560 --> 16:44.680\n Have you heard this?\n\n16:44.680 --> 16:45.520\n No. Basically, I mean.\n\n16:45.520 --> 16:47.380\n This is great.\n\n16:47.380 --> 16:49.640\n There's not, a single human out there\n\n16:49.640 --> 16:51.640\n has absolutely no idea how to make a pencil.\n\n16:51.640 --> 16:54.040\n So you have to think about, you have to get the wood,\n\n16:54.040 --> 16:56.160\n the paint, the different chemicals\n\n16:56.160 --> 16:57.640\n that make up the yellow paint.\n\n16:57.640 --> 16:59.480\n The eraser is a whole other thing.\n\n16:59.480 --> 17:01.440\n The metal has to be mined from somewhere\n\n17:01.440 --> 17:04.640\n and then the graphite, whatever that is.\n\n17:04.640 --> 17:06.120\n And there's not one person on earth\n\n17:06.120 --> 17:10.040\n who knows how to kind of collect all those materials\n\n17:10.040 --> 17:12.600\n and create a pencil, but together,\n\n17:12.600 --> 17:14.120\n that's one of the, that's child's play.\n\n17:14.120 --> 17:15.280\n It's just one of the easiest things.\n\n17:15.280 --> 17:18.520\n So, you know, the other thing I like to think about,\n\n17:18.520 --> 17:21.080\n I actually put this as a question on the blog once.\n\n17:22.360 --> 17:23.800\n There's a thought experiment\n\n17:24.800 --> 17:26.000\n and I actually wanna hear what you think.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.800\n So if a witch, kind of a dickish witch comes around\n\n17:30.800 --> 17:35.040\n and she says, I'm gonna cast a spell on all of humanity\n\n17:35.040 --> 17:39.360\n and all material things that you've invented\n\n17:39.360 --> 17:41.380\n are gonna disappear all at once.\n\n17:41.380 --> 17:42.960\n So suddenly we're all standing there naked.\n\n17:42.960 --> 17:44.500\n There's no buildings.\n\n17:44.500 --> 17:48.720\n There's no cars and boats and ships and no mines,\n\n17:48.720 --> 17:49.880\n nothing, right?\n\n17:49.880 --> 17:52.960\n It's just the stone age earth and a bunch of naked humans,\n\n17:52.960 --> 17:54.440\n but we're all the same, we have the same brain.\n\n17:54.440 --> 17:55.920\n So we're all know what's going on.\n\n17:55.920 --> 17:57.960\n And we all got a note from her, so we understand the deal.\n\n17:57.960 --> 18:00.560\n And she says, she communicated to every human,\n\n18:00.560 --> 18:02.920\n here's the deal, you lost all your stuff.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:07.320\n You guys need to make one working iPhone 13\n\n18:07.320 --> 18:09.520\n and you make one working iPhone 13\n\n18:09.520 --> 18:11.680\n that could pass in the Apple store today,\n\n18:11.680 --> 18:13.880\n you know, in your previous world\n\n18:13.880 --> 18:16.440\n for an iPhone 13, then I will restore everything.\n\n18:16.440 --> 18:17.360\n How long do you think?\n\n18:17.360 --> 18:19.080\n And so everyone knows this is the mission.\n\n18:19.080 --> 18:21.680\n We're all aware of the mission, everyone, all humans.\n\n18:22.680 --> 18:23.800\n How long would it take us?\n\n18:23.800 --> 18:25.240\n That's a really interesting question.\n\n18:25.240 --> 18:28.000\n So obviously if you do a random selection\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:31.280\n of 100 or a thousand humans within the population,\n\n18:31.280 --> 18:34.720\n I think you're screwed to make that iPhone.\n\n18:34.720 --> 18:39.540\n I tend to believe that there's fascinating specialization\n\n18:39.540 --> 18:40.840\n among the human civilization.\n\n18:40.840 --> 18:43.160\n Like there's a few hackers out there\n\n18:43.160 --> 18:46.500\n that can like solo build an iPhone.\n\n18:46.500 --> 18:48.520\n But with what materials?\n\n18:48.520 --> 18:50.360\n So no materials whatsoever.\n\n18:51.480 --> 18:54.920\n It has to, I mean, it's virtually, I mean, okay.\n\n18:54.920 --> 18:56.560\n You have to build factories.\n\n18:56.560 --> 18:59.120\n I mean, to fabricate.\n\n19:00.960 --> 19:02.120\n Okay.\n\n19:02.120 --> 19:03.360\n And how are you gonna mine them?\n\n19:03.360 --> 19:04.420\n You know, you gotta mine the materials\n\n19:04.420 --> 19:05.480\n where you don't have any cranes.\n\n19:05.480 --> 19:06.740\n You don't have any, you know.\n\n19:06.740 --> 19:10.820\n Okay, you 100% have to have the, everybody's naked.\n\n19:10.820 --> 19:12.320\n Everyone's naked and everyone's where they are.\n\n19:12.320 --> 19:14.000\n So you and I would currently be naked.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.280\n It's on the ground in what used to be Manhattan.\n\n19:16.280 --> 19:17.120\n So no building.\n\n19:17.120 --> 19:18.600\n No, grassy island.\n\n19:18.600 --> 19:19.440\n Yeah.\n\n19:19.440 --> 19:22.140\n So you need a naked Elon Musk type character\n\n19:22.140 --> 19:23.840\n to then start building a company.\n\n19:23.840 --> 19:25.600\n You have to have a large company then.\n\n19:25.600 --> 19:26.440\n Right.\n\n19:26.440 --> 19:27.480\n He doesn't even know where he, you know,\n\n19:27.480 --> 19:28.320\n where is everyone?\n\n19:28.320 --> 19:29.680\n You know, oh shit, how am I gonna find\n\n19:29.680 --> 19:30.520\n other people I need to talk to?\n\n19:30.520 --> 19:32.000\n But we have all the knowledge of.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:33.000\n Yeah, everyone has the knowledge\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:34.040\n that's in their current brains.\n\n19:34.040 --> 19:34.880\n Yeah.\n\n19:34.880 --> 19:38.440\n I've met some legit engineers.\n\n19:38.440 --> 19:39.800\n Crazy polymath people.\n\n19:39.800 --> 19:42.840\n Yeah, but the actual labor of,\n\n19:42.840 --> 19:47.160\n cause you said, cause like the original Mac,\n\n19:47.160 --> 19:50.480\n like the Apple II, that can be built.\n\n19:50.480 --> 19:51.480\n But.\n\n19:51.480 --> 19:52.320\n Even that, you know.\n\n19:52.320 --> 19:53.160\n Even that's gonna be tough.\n\n19:53.160 --> 19:55.240\n Well, I think part of it is a communication problem.\n\n19:55.240 --> 19:56.880\n If you could suddenly have, you know, someone,\n\n19:56.880 --> 19:58.160\n if everyone had a walkie talkie\n\n19:58.160 --> 19:59.600\n and there was, you know, a couple, you know,\n\n19:59.600 --> 20:01.880\n 10 really smart people were designated the leaders,\n\n20:01.880 --> 20:02.960\n they could say, okay, I want, you know,\n\n20:02.960 --> 20:05.940\n everyone who can do this to walk west, you know,\n\n20:05.940 --> 20:08.200\n until you get to this little hub and everyone else,\n\n20:08.200 --> 20:10.200\n you know, and they could actually coordinate,\n\n20:10.200 --> 20:11.120\n but we don't have that.\n\n20:11.120 --> 20:12.240\n So it's like people just, you know,\n\n20:12.240 --> 20:14.080\n and then what I think about is,\n\n20:14.080 --> 20:15.960\n so you've got some people that are like trying to organize\n\n20:15.960 --> 20:17.120\n and you'll have a little community\n\n20:17.120 --> 20:18.640\n where a couple hundred people have come together\n\n20:18.640 --> 20:20.120\n and maybe a couple thousand have organized\n\n20:20.120 --> 20:22.320\n and they designated one person, you know, as the leader\n\n20:22.320 --> 20:24.360\n and then they have sub leaders and okay,\n\n20:24.360 --> 20:25.200\n we have a start here.\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:26.320\n We have some organization.\n\n20:26.320 --> 20:28.880\n You're also gonna have some people that say, good,\n\n20:28.880 --> 20:31.600\n humans were scourged upon the earth and this is good.\n\n20:31.600 --> 20:32.560\n And they're gonna try to sabotage.\n\n20:32.560 --> 20:33.880\n They're gonna try to murder the people with the,\n\n20:33.880 --> 20:35.880\n and who know what they're talking about.\n\n20:35.880 --> 20:36.720\n Yeah.\n\n20:37.760 --> 20:40.880\n The elite that possessed the knowledge.\n\n20:40.880 --> 20:42.720\n Well, and so everyone, maybe everyone's hopeful\n\n20:42.720 --> 20:44.320\n for the, you know, we're all civilized and hopeful\n\n20:44.320 --> 20:45.720\n for the first 30 days or something.\n\n20:45.720 --> 20:47.120\n And then things start to fall off.\n\n20:47.120 --> 20:48.760\n They, you know, people get, start to lose hope\n\n20:48.760 --> 20:50.280\n and there's new kinds of, you know,\n\n20:50.280 --> 20:52.200\n new kinds of governments popping up, you know,\n\n20:52.200 --> 20:55.960\n new kinds of societies and they're, you know,\n\n20:55.960 --> 20:57.680\n and they don't play nicely with the other ones.\n\n20:57.680 --> 20:59.180\n And I think very quickly,\n\n20:59.180 --> 21:00.460\n I think a lot of people would just give up and say,\n\n21:00.460 --> 21:01.300\n you know what, this is it.\n\n21:01.300 --> 21:02.120\n We're back in the stone age.\n\n21:02.120 --> 21:03.800\n Let's just create, you know, agrarian.\n\n21:03.800 --> 21:05.040\n We don't also don't know how to farm.\n\n21:05.040 --> 21:06.080\n No one knows how to farm.\n\n21:06.080 --> 21:08.480\n There's like, even the farmers, you know,\n\n21:08.480 --> 21:11.040\n a lot of them are relying on their machines.\n\n21:11.040 --> 21:14.680\n And so we also, you know, mass starvation.\n\n21:14.680 --> 21:16.420\n And that, you know, when you're trying to organize,\n\n21:16.420 --> 21:18.740\n a lot of people are, you know, coming in with, you know,\n\n21:18.740 --> 21:21.840\n spears they've fashioned and trying to murder everyone\n\n21:21.840 --> 21:22.680\n who has food.\n\n21:22.680 --> 21:23.520\n That's an interesting question.\n\n21:23.520 --> 21:25.640\n Given today's society, how much violence would that be?\n\n21:25.640 --> 21:28.000\n We've gotten softer, less violent.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.040\n And we don't have weapons.\n\n21:29.040 --> 21:29.880\n So that's something. We don't have weapons.\n\n21:29.880 --> 21:31.720\n We have really primitive weapons now.\n\n21:31.720 --> 21:33.980\n But we have, and also we have a kind of ethics\n\n21:33.980 --> 21:35.640\n where murder is bad.\n\n21:35.640 --> 21:38.920\n We used to be less, like human life was less valued\n\n21:38.920 --> 21:39.760\n in the past.\n\n21:39.760 --> 21:41.920\n So murder was more okay, like ethically.\n\n21:41.920 --> 21:44.320\n But in the past, they also were really good\n\n21:44.320 --> 21:46.300\n at figuring out how to have sustenance.\n\n21:46.300 --> 21:48.640\n They knew how to get food and water because they,\n\n21:48.640 --> 21:49.800\n so we have no idea.\n\n21:49.800 --> 21:51.980\n Like the ancient hunter gatherer societies would laugh\n\n21:51.980 --> 21:52.840\n at what's going on here.\n\n21:52.840 --> 21:54.280\n They'd say, you guys, you don't know what you're,\n\n21:54.280 --> 21:55.400\n none of you know what you're doing.\n\n21:55.400 --> 21:56.240\n Yeah.\n\n21:56.240 --> 21:59.360\n And also the amount of people feeding this amount of people\n\n21:59.360 --> 22:02.200\n in a very, in a stone age, you know, civilization,\n\n22:02.200 --> 22:03.800\n that's not gonna happen.\n\n22:03.800 --> 22:05.960\n So New York and San Francisco are screwed.\n\n22:05.960 --> 22:07.840\n Well, whoever's not near water is really screwed.\n\n22:07.840 --> 22:10.120\n So that's, you're near a river or freshwater river.\n\n22:10.120 --> 22:12.400\n And you know, anyway, it's a very interesting question.\n\n22:12.400 --> 22:14.440\n And what it does, this and the pencil,\n\n22:14.440 --> 22:19.220\n it makes me feel so grateful and like excited about like,\n\n22:19.220 --> 22:21.560\n man, our civilization is so cool.\n\n22:21.560 --> 22:24.440\n And this is, talk about collective intelligence.\n\n22:24.440 --> 22:28.040\n Humans did not build any of this.\n\n22:28.040 --> 22:30.440\n It's collective human super,\n\n22:30.440 --> 22:32.760\n collective humans is a super intelligent,\n\n22:32.760 --> 22:37.200\n you know, being that is, that can do absolutely,\n\n22:37.200 --> 22:38.560\n especially over a long period of time,\n\n22:38.560 --> 22:39.640\n can do such magical things.\n\n22:39.640 --> 22:41.800\n And we just get to be born, when I go out,\n\n22:41.800 --> 22:42.940\n when I'm working and I'm hungry,\n\n22:42.940 --> 22:46.320\n I just go click, click, click, and like a salad's coming.\n\n22:46.320 --> 22:47.160\n The salad arrives.\n\n22:47.160 --> 22:50.040\n If you think about the incredible infrastructure\n\n22:50.040 --> 22:52.040\n that's in place for that, for that quickly,\n\n22:52.040 --> 22:54.380\n or just the internet to, you know, the electricity,\n\n22:54.380 --> 22:55.960\n first of all, that's just powering the things, you know,\n\n22:55.960 --> 22:57.960\n how the, where the, the amount of structures\n\n22:57.960 --> 23:00.640\n that have to be created and for that electricity to be there.\n\n23:00.640 --> 23:02.560\n And then you've got the, you've of course the internet,\n\n23:02.560 --> 23:05.560\n and then you have this system where delivery drivers\n\n23:05.560 --> 23:06.600\n and they have, they're riding bikes\n\n23:06.600 --> 23:07.640\n that were made by someone else.\n\n23:07.640 --> 23:09.120\n And they're going to get the salad\n\n23:09.120 --> 23:11.480\n and all those ingredients came from all over the place.\n\n23:11.480 --> 23:13.600\n I mean, it's just, so I think it's like,\n\n23:13.600 --> 23:15.360\n I like thinking about these things\n\n23:15.360 --> 23:19.220\n because it makes me feel like just so grateful.\n\n23:19.220 --> 23:21.300\n I'm like, man, it would be so awful if we didn't have this.\n\n23:21.300 --> 23:22.720\n And people who didn't have it would think\n\n23:22.720 --> 23:25.180\n this was such magic we live in and we do.\n\n23:25.180 --> 23:27.520\n And like, cool, that's fun.\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:29.640\n Yeah, one of the most amazing things when I showed up,\n\n23:29.640 --> 23:32.160\n I came here at 13 from the Soviet Union\n\n23:32.160 --> 23:36.560\n and the supermarket was, people don't really realize that,\n\n23:36.560 --> 23:39.960\n but the abundance of food, it's not even,\n\n23:41.240 --> 23:43.440\n so bananas was the thing I was obsessed about.\n\n23:43.440 --> 23:45.760\n I just ate bananas every day for many, many months\n\n23:45.760 --> 23:47.720\n because they haven't had bananas in Russia.\n\n23:47.720 --> 23:49.800\n And the fact that you can have as many bananas as you want,\n\n23:49.800 --> 23:53.320\n plus they were like somewhat inexpensive\n\n23:53.320 --> 23:54.720\n relative to the other food.\n\n23:56.160 --> 23:58.080\n The fact that you can somehow have a system\n\n23:58.080 --> 24:00.200\n that brings bananas to you without having to wait\n\n24:00.200 --> 24:02.040\n in a long line, all of those things,\n\n24:02.040 --> 24:03.240\n it's magic.\n\n24:03.240 --> 24:06.000\n I mean, also imagine, so first of all,\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.640\n the ancient hunter gatherers,\n\n24:07.640 --> 24:08.960\n you picture the mother gathering and eating\n\n24:08.960 --> 24:10.360\n for all this fresh food, no.\n\n24:10.360 --> 24:11.960\n So do you know what an avocado used to look like?\n\n24:11.960 --> 24:15.920\n It was a little like a sphere and the fruit of it,\n\n24:15.920 --> 24:18.280\n the actual avocado part was like a little tiny layer\n\n24:18.280 --> 24:21.440\n around this big pit that took up almost the whole volume.\n\n24:21.440 --> 24:25.840\n We've made crazy robot avocados today\n\n24:25.840 --> 24:28.280\n that have nothing to do with like what they,\n\n24:28.280 --> 24:33.280\n so same with bananas, these big, sweet, you know,\n\n24:33.280 --> 24:35.760\n and not infested with bugs and, you know,\n\n24:35.760 --> 24:37.760\n they used to eat the shittiest food\n\n24:38.640 --> 24:40.840\n and they're eating uncooked meat\n\n24:40.840 --> 24:42.840\n or maybe they cook it and they're just, it's gross\n\n24:42.840 --> 24:44.680\n and it's things rot.\n\n24:44.680 --> 24:47.240\n So you go to the supermarket and it's just,\n\n24:47.240 --> 24:49.960\n A, it's like crazy super engineered cartoon food,\n\n24:49.960 --> 24:51.360\n fruit and food.\n\n24:51.360 --> 24:52.480\n And then it's all this processed food,\n\n24:52.480 --> 24:54.120\n which, you know, we complain about in our setting.\n\n24:54.120 --> 24:55.240\n Oh, you know, we complain about, you know,\n\n24:55.240 --> 24:56.720\n we need too much process.\n\n24:56.720 --> 24:58.280\n That's a, this is a good problem.\n\n24:58.280 --> 25:00.360\n I mean, if you imagine what they would think,\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:01.400\n oh my God, a cracker.\n\n25:01.400 --> 25:04.280\n You know how delicious a cracker would taste to them?\n\n25:04.280 --> 25:08.120\n You know, candy, you know, pasta and spaghetti.\n\n25:08.120 --> 25:09.360\n They never had anything like this.\n\n25:09.360 --> 25:11.440\n And then you have from all over the world,\n\n25:11.440 --> 25:13.960\n I mean, things that are grown all over the place,\n\n25:13.960 --> 25:16.040\n all here in nice little racks organized\n\n25:16.040 --> 25:17.920\n and on a middle class salary,\n\n25:17.920 --> 25:20.040\n you can afford anything you want.\n\n25:20.040 --> 25:23.200\n I mean, it's again, just like incredible gratitude.\n\n25:23.200 --> 25:25.120\n Like, ah, yeah.\n\n25:25.120 --> 25:27.440\n And the question is how resilient is this whole thing?\n\n25:27.440 --> 25:31.840\n I mean, this is another darker version of your question is\n\n25:31.840 --> 25:35.240\n if we keep all the material possessions we have,\n\n25:35.240 --> 25:39.520\n but we start knocking out some percent of the population,\n\n25:39.520 --> 25:42.080\n how resilient is the system that we built up\n\n25:42.080 --> 25:43.920\n where we rely on other humans\n\n25:43.920 --> 25:45.880\n and the knowledge that built up on the past,\n\n25:45.880 --> 25:48.880\n the distributed nature of knowledge,\n\n25:50.120 --> 25:52.960\n how much does it take?\n\n25:52.960 --> 25:55.480\n How many humans need to disappear\n\n25:55.480 --> 25:57.840\n for us to be completely lost?\n\n25:57.840 --> 25:59.160\n Well, I'm trying to go off one thing,\n\n25:59.160 --> 26:02.480\n which is Elon Musk says that he has this number,\n\n26:02.480 --> 26:05.920\n a million in mind as the order of magnitude of people\n\n26:05.920 --> 26:10.920\n you need to be on Mars to truly be multi planetary.\n\n26:11.760 --> 26:13.600\n Multi planetary doesn't mean, you know,\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:19.480\n like when Neil Armstrong, you know, goes to the moon,\n\n26:19.480 --> 26:21.920\n they call it a great leap for mankind.\n\n26:21.920 --> 26:23.760\n It's not a great leap for anything.\n\n26:23.760 --> 26:26.760\n It is a great achievement for mankind.\n\n26:26.760 --> 26:29.440\n And I always like think about if the first fish\n\n26:29.440 --> 26:31.960\n to kind of go on land just kind of went up\n\n26:31.960 --> 26:33.320\n and gave the shore a high five\n\n26:33.320 --> 26:34.240\n and goes back into the water,\n\n26:34.240 --> 26:36.040\n that's not a great leap for life.\n\n26:36.040 --> 26:37.240\n That's a great achievement for that fish.\n\n26:37.240 --> 26:38.520\n And there should be a little statue of that fish\n\n26:38.520 --> 26:39.680\n and it's, you know, in the water\n\n26:39.680 --> 26:41.400\n and everyone should celebrate the fish.\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:44.880\n But it's, but when we talk about a great leap for life,\n\n26:44.880 --> 26:45.720\n it's permanent.\n\n26:45.720 --> 26:48.680\n It's something that now from now on, this is how things are.\n\n26:48.680 --> 26:51.080\n So this is part of why I get so excited about Mars,\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:53.800\n by the way, is because you can count on one hand,\n\n26:53.800 --> 26:57.120\n like the number of great leaps that we've had,\n\n26:57.120 --> 27:00.840\n you know, like no life to life and single cell\n\n27:00.840 --> 27:02.680\n or simple cell to complex cell\n\n27:02.680 --> 27:06.000\n and single cell organisms to animals to come,\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.200\n you know, multi cell animals and then ocean to land\n\n27:09.200 --> 27:12.640\n and then one planet to two planets, anyway, diversion.\n\n27:12.640 --> 27:17.120\n But the point is that we are officially that leap\n\n27:17.120 --> 27:19.880\n for all of life, you know, has happened\n\n27:19.880 --> 27:22.680\n once the ships could stop coming from Earth\n\n27:22.680 --> 27:24.760\n because there's some horrible catastrophic World War III\n\n27:24.760 --> 27:26.240\n and everyone dies on Earth and they're fine\n\n27:26.240 --> 27:29.160\n and they can turn that certain X number of people\n\n27:29.160 --> 27:31.680\n into 7 billion, you know, population\n\n27:31.680 --> 27:33.000\n that's thriving just like Earth.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.400\n They can build ships, they can come back\n\n27:34.400 --> 27:35.240\n and recolonize Earth\n\n27:35.240 --> 27:37.160\n because now we are officially multi planetary\n\n27:37.160 --> 27:38.800\n where it's a self sustaining.\n\n27:38.800 --> 27:40.800\n He says a million people is about what he thinks.\n\n27:40.800 --> 27:42.520\n Now that might be a specialized group.\n\n27:42.520 --> 27:44.560\n That's a very specifically, you know,\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:49.240\n selected million that has very, very skilled million people,\n\n27:49.240 --> 27:51.560\n not just maybe the average million on Earth,\n\n27:51.560 --> 27:53.160\n but I think it depends what you're talking about.\n\n27:53.160 --> 27:56.120\n But I don't think, you know, so one million is one 7,000th,\n\n27:56.120 --> 27:58.440\n one 8,000th of the current population.\n\n27:58.440 --> 28:02.160\n I think you need a very, very, very small fraction\n\n28:02.160 --> 28:04.480\n of humans on Earth to get by.\n\n28:04.480 --> 28:05.320\n Obviously you're not gonna have\n\n28:05.320 --> 28:06.920\n the same thriving civilization\n\n28:06.920 --> 28:08.440\n if you get to a too small a number,\n\n28:08.440 --> 28:10.640\n but it depends who you're killing off, I guess,\n\n28:10.640 --> 28:11.920\n is part of the question.\n\n28:11.920 --> 28:14.280\n Yeah, if you killed off half of the people\n\n28:14.280 --> 28:15.680\n just randomly right now, I think we'd be fine.\n\n28:15.680 --> 28:18.720\n It would be obviously a great awful tragedy.\n\n28:18.720 --> 28:19.920\n I think if you killed off three quarters\n\n28:19.920 --> 28:20.760\n of all people randomly,\n\n28:20.760 --> 28:22.440\n just three out of every four people drops dead.\n\n28:22.440 --> 28:24.800\n I think we'd have, obviously the stock market would crash.\n\n28:24.800 --> 28:27.040\n We'd have a rough patch,\n\n28:27.040 --> 28:30.520\n but I almost can assure you that the species would be fine.\n\n28:30.520 --> 28:31.760\n Well, cause the million number,\n\n28:31.760 --> 28:33.780\n like you said, it is specialized.\n\n28:33.780 --> 28:38.780\n So I think, cause you have to do this,\n\n28:39.080 --> 28:41.680\n you have to basically do the iPhone experiment.\n\n28:41.680 --> 28:46.160\n Like literally you have to be able to manufacture computers.\n\n28:46.160 --> 28:47.000\n Yeah, everything.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.480\n If you're gonna have the self sustaining means\n\n28:48.480 --> 28:50.840\n you can, any major important skill,\n\n28:50.840 --> 28:53.600\n any important piece of kind of infrastructure on earth\n\n28:53.600 --> 28:56.580\n can be built there just as well.\n\n28:57.560 --> 29:00.200\n It'd be interesting to list out\n\n29:00.200 --> 29:01.940\n what are the important things,\n\n29:01.940 --> 29:03.400\n what are the important skills?\n\n29:03.400 --> 29:05.980\n Yeah, I mean, if you have to feed everyone,\n\n29:05.980 --> 29:08.880\n so mass farming, things like that,\n\n29:08.880 --> 29:12.040\n you have to, you have to, you have mining,\n\n29:12.040 --> 29:15.300\n these questions, it's like the materials might be,\n\n29:15.300 --> 29:17.660\n I don't know, five mile, two miles underground,\n\n29:17.660 --> 29:20.400\n I don't know what the actual, but like,\n\n29:20.400 --> 29:22.080\n it's amazing to me just that these things\n\n29:22.080 --> 29:23.080\n got built in the first place.\n\n29:23.080 --> 29:25.320\n And they never got, no one built the first,\n\n29:25.320 --> 29:28.200\n the mine that we're getting stuff for the iPhone for\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:30.720\n probably wasn't built for the iPhone.\n\n29:30.720 --> 29:33.280\n Or in general, early mining was for,\n\n29:33.280 --> 29:35.520\n I think obviously I assume the industrial revolution\n\n29:35.520 --> 29:37.040\n when we realized, oh, fossil fuels,\n\n29:37.040 --> 29:40.080\n we wanna extract this magical energy source.\n\n29:40.080 --> 29:42.240\n I assume that like mining took a huge leap\n\n29:42.240 --> 29:43.400\n without knowing very much about this.\n\n29:43.400 --> 29:45.760\n I think you're gonna need mining,\n\n29:45.760 --> 29:48.480\n you're gonna need like a lot of electrical engineers.\n\n29:48.480 --> 29:50.080\n If you're gonna have a civilization like ours,\n\n29:50.080 --> 29:51.960\n and of course you could have oil and lanterns,\n\n29:51.960 --> 29:53.200\n we could go way back,\n\n29:53.200 --> 29:55.280\n but if you're trying to build our today thing,\n\n29:55.280 --> 29:58.360\n you're gonna need energy and electricity\n\n29:58.360 --> 30:00.620\n and then mines that can bring materials,\n\n30:00.620 --> 30:03.360\n and then you're gonna need a ton of plumbing\n\n30:03.360 --> 30:05.360\n and everything that entails.\n\n30:05.360 --> 30:07.680\n And like you said, food, but also the manufacturer,\n\n30:07.680 --> 30:10.800\n so like turning raw materials into something useful,\n\n30:10.800 --> 30:13.040\n that whole thing, like factories,\n\n30:13.040 --> 30:15.560\n some supply chain, transportation.\n\n30:15.560 --> 30:17.480\n Right, I mean, you think about,\n\n30:17.480 --> 30:18.460\n when we talk about like world hunger,\n\n30:18.460 --> 30:20.960\n one of the major problems is,\n\n30:20.960 --> 30:22.760\n there's plenty of food and by the time it arrives,\n\n30:22.760 --> 30:24.720\n most of it's gone bad in the truck,\n\n30:24.720 --> 30:26.940\n in a kind of an impoverished place.\n\n30:26.940 --> 30:29.680\n So it's like, again, we take it so for granted,\n\n30:29.680 --> 30:33.440\n all the food in the supermarket is fresh, it's all there.\n\n30:33.440 --> 30:35.440\n And which always stresses me,\n\n30:35.440 --> 30:36.440\n if I were running a supermarket,\n\n30:36.440 --> 30:37.920\n I would always be so like miserable\n\n30:37.920 --> 30:41.620\n about like things going bad on the shelves,\n\n30:41.620 --> 30:43.080\n or if you don't have enough, that's not good,\n\n30:43.080 --> 30:44.360\n but if you have too much, it goes bad anyway.\n\n30:44.360 --> 30:46.880\n Of course, there'll be entertainers too.\n\n30:46.880 --> 30:48.960\n Like somebody would have a YouTube channel\n\n30:48.960 --> 30:50.840\n that's running on Mars.\n\n30:50.840 --> 30:55.400\n There is something different about a civilization on Mars\n\n30:55.400 --> 30:59.240\n and Earth existing versus like a civilization\n\n30:59.240 --> 31:01.400\n in the United States versus Russia and China.\n\n31:01.400 --> 31:03.240\n Like that's a different,\n\n31:03.240 --> 31:07.360\n fundamentally different distance, like philosophically.\n\n31:07.360 --> 31:08.200\n Will it be like fuzzy?\n\n31:08.200 --> 31:09.940\n We know there'll be like a reality show on Mars\n\n31:09.940 --> 31:11.400\n that everyone on Earth is obsessed with.\n\n31:11.400 --> 31:15.160\n And I think if people are going back and forth enough,\n\n31:15.160 --> 31:16.080\n then it becomes fuzzy.\n\n31:16.080 --> 31:17.600\n It becomes like, oh, our friends on Mars.\n\n31:17.600 --> 31:19.600\n And there's like this Mars versus Earth,\n\n31:19.600 --> 31:22.640\n and it become like fun tribalism.\n\n31:22.640 --> 31:25.240\n I think if people don't rarely go back and forth\n\n31:25.240 --> 31:26.240\n and it really, they're there for,\n\n31:26.240 --> 31:28.280\n I think if you get kind of like, oh, we hate,\n\n31:28.280 --> 31:30.360\n a lot of like us versus them stuff going on.\n\n31:30.360 --> 31:33.880\n There could be also war in space for territory.\n\n31:33.880 --> 31:38.480\n As a first colony happens, China, Russia,\n\n31:38.480 --> 31:41.680\n or whoever the European, different European nations,\n\n31:41.680 --> 31:43.560\n Switzerland finally gets their act together\n\n31:43.560 --> 31:46.840\n and starts wars as opposed to staying out of all of them.\n\n31:46.840 --> 31:49.040\n Yeah, there's all kinds of crazy geopolitical things\n\n31:49.040 --> 31:51.000\n that like we have not even,\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.720\n no one's really even thought about too much yet\n\n31:52.720 --> 31:54.440\n that like, it could get weird.\n\n31:54.440 --> 31:57.520\n Think about the 1500s when it was suddenly like a race\n\n31:57.520 --> 32:00.380\n to like colonize or capture land\n\n32:00.380 --> 32:02.360\n or discover new land that hasn't been,\n\n32:02.360 --> 32:04.360\n so it was like this new frontiers.\n\n32:04.360 --> 32:06.840\n There's not really, the land is not,\n\n32:06.840 --> 32:09.240\n the thing about Crimea was like this huge thing\n\n32:09.240 --> 32:11.260\n because this tiny peninsula switched.\n\n32:11.260 --> 32:13.980\n That's how like optimized everything has become.\n\n32:13.980 --> 32:16.400\n Everything is just like really stuck.\n\n32:16.400 --> 32:18.500\n Mars is a whole new world of like,\n\n32:18.500 --> 32:21.100\n territory, naming things and you know,\n\n32:22.340 --> 32:24.960\n and it's a chance for new kind of governments maybe,\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:27.440\n or maybe it's just the colonies of these governments\n\n32:27.440 --> 32:28.680\n so we don't get that opportunity.\n\n32:28.680 --> 32:30.000\n I think it'd be cool if there's new countries\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.160\n being totally new experiments.\n\n32:32.160 --> 32:34.800\n And that's fascinating because Elon talks exactly\n\n32:34.800 --> 32:36.560\n about that and I believe that very much.\n\n32:36.560 --> 32:40.400\n Like that should be, like from the start,\n\n32:40.400 --> 32:43.240\n they should determine their own sovereignty.\n\n32:43.240 --> 32:46.320\n Like they should determine their own thing.\n\n32:46.320 --> 32:50.880\n There was one modern democracy in late 1700s, the US.\n\n32:50.880 --> 32:53.480\n I mean, it was the only modern democracy.\n\n32:53.480 --> 32:57.600\n And now of course, there's hundreds or dozen, many dozens.\n\n32:57.600 --> 32:59.720\n But I think part of the reason that was able to start,\n\n32:59.720 --> 33:01.040\n I mean, it's not that people didn't have the idea,\n\n33:01.040 --> 33:04.440\n people had the idea, it was that they had a clean slate,\n\n33:04.440 --> 33:06.720\n new place, and they suddenly were,\n\n33:06.720 --> 33:10.200\n so I think it would be a great opportunity to have,\n\n33:10.200 --> 33:11.720\n there's a lot of people who have done that,\n\n33:11.720 --> 33:13.920\n oh, if I had my own government on an island,\n\n33:13.920 --> 33:15.560\n my own country, what would I do?\n\n33:15.560 --> 33:20.120\n And the US founders actually had the opportunity,\n\n33:20.120 --> 33:21.640\n that fantasy, they were like, we can do it.\n\n33:21.640 --> 33:23.880\n Let's make, okay, what's the perfect country?\n\n33:23.880 --> 33:25.360\n And they tried to make something.\n\n33:25.360 --> 33:29.480\n Sometimes progress is, it's not held up by our imagination.\n\n33:29.480 --> 33:33.360\n It's held up by just, there's no blank canvas\n\n33:33.360 --> 33:34.400\n to try something on.\n\n33:35.560 --> 33:37.480\n Yeah, it's an opportunity for a fresh start.\n\n33:37.480 --> 33:39.440\n The funny thing about the conversation we're having\n\n33:39.440 --> 33:42.520\n is not often had, I mean, even by Elon,\n\n33:42.520 --> 33:43.720\n he's so focused on Starship\n\n33:43.720 --> 33:46.160\n and actually putting the first human on Mars.\n\n33:46.160 --> 33:51.160\n I think thinking about this kind of stuff is inspiring.\n\n33:51.640 --> 33:55.160\n It makes us dream, it makes us hope for the future.\n\n33:55.160 --> 33:59.080\n And it makes us somehow thinking about civilization on Mars\n\n33:59.080 --> 34:03.240\n is helping us think about the civilization here on Earth.\n\n34:03.240 --> 34:05.040\n Yeah, totally. And how we should run it.\n\n34:05.040 --> 34:07.600\n Well, what do you think are, like in our lifetime,\n\n34:07.600 --> 34:11.180\n are we gonna, I think any effort that goes to Mars,\n\n34:11.180 --> 34:13.280\n the goal is in this decade.\n\n34:13.280 --> 34:15.400\n Do you think that's actually gonna be achieved?\n\n34:15.400 --> 34:18.840\n I have a big bet, $10,000 with a friend\n\n34:18.840 --> 34:21.480\n when I was drunk in an argument.\n\n34:21.480 --> 34:22.320\n This is great.\n\n34:22.320 --> 34:23.960\n That the Neil Armstrong of Mars,\n\n34:23.960 --> 34:28.680\n whoever he or she may be, will set foot by the end of 2030.\n\n34:28.680 --> 34:30.960\n Now, this was probably in 2018 when I had this argument.\n\n34:30.960 --> 34:31.800\n So, like what if it?\n\n34:31.800 --> 34:35.560\n So, a human has to touch Mars by the end of 2030.\n\n34:35.560 --> 34:37.120\n Oh, by the year 30.\n\n34:37.120 --> 34:39.600\n Yeah, by January 1st, 2031.\n\n34:39.600 --> 34:40.440\n Yeah.\n\n34:41.680 --> 34:44.120\n Did you agree on the time zone or what?\n\n34:44.120 --> 34:44.960\n No, no.\n\n34:44.960 --> 34:46.080\n If it's coming on that exact day,\n\n34:46.080 --> 34:47.600\n that's gonna be really stressful.\n\n34:48.860 --> 34:52.120\n But anyway, I think that there will be.\n\n34:52.120 --> 34:53.240\n That was 2018.\n\n34:53.240 --> 34:54.920\n I was more confident then.\n\n34:54.920 --> 34:56.240\n I think it's gonna be around this time.\n\n34:56.240 --> 34:58.240\n I mean, I still won the general bet\n\n34:58.240 --> 34:59.680\n because his point was, you are crazy.\n\n34:59.680 --> 35:01.120\n This is not gonna happen in our lifetimes.\n\n35:01.120 --> 35:02.640\n I've been offered many, many decades.\n\n35:02.640 --> 35:03.520\n And I said, you're wrong.\n\n35:03.520 --> 35:05.520\n You don't know what's going on in SpaceX.\n\n35:05.520 --> 35:08.200\n I think if the world depended on it,\n\n35:08.200 --> 35:10.480\n I think probably SpaceX could probably.\n\n35:10.480 --> 35:11.520\n I mean, I don't know this,\n\n35:11.520 --> 35:14.440\n but I think the tech is almost there.\n\n35:14.440 --> 35:16.600\n Like, I don't think, of course,\n\n35:16.600 --> 35:18.160\n it's delayed many years by safety.\n\n35:18.160 --> 35:20.360\n So, they first wanna send a ship around Mars\n\n35:20.360 --> 35:22.080\n and they wanna land a cargo ship on Mars.\n\n35:22.080 --> 35:23.320\n And there's the moon on the way to.\n\n35:23.320 --> 35:24.360\n Yeah, yeah, there's a lot.\n\n35:24.360 --> 35:27.000\n But I think the moon, a decade before,\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:30.640\n seemed like magical tech that humans didn't have.\n\n35:30.640 --> 35:33.160\n This is like, no, we can,\n\n35:33.160 --> 35:35.600\n it's totally conceivable that this,\n\n35:35.600 --> 35:36.720\n you've seen Starship,\n\n35:36.720 --> 35:41.720\n like it is a interplanetary colonial\n\n35:41.720 --> 35:43.960\n or interplanetary transport like system.\n\n35:43.960 --> 35:45.400\n That's what they used to call it.\n\n35:45.400 --> 35:47.520\n The SpaceX, the way they do it is,\n\n35:47.520 --> 35:49.000\n every time they do a launch,\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:52.120\n something fails usually, when they're testing\n\n35:52.120 --> 35:54.280\n and they learn a thousand things.\n\n35:54.280 --> 35:57.320\n The amount of data they get and they improve so,\n\n35:57.320 --> 36:00.120\n each one has, it's like they've moved up\n\n36:00.120 --> 36:01.560\n like eight generations in each one.\n\n36:01.560 --> 36:04.480\n Anyway, so it's not inconceivable that pretty soon\n\n36:04.480 --> 36:07.600\n they could send a Starship to Mars and land it.\n\n36:07.600 --> 36:08.520\n There's just no good reason\n\n36:08.520 --> 36:09.800\n I don't think that they couldn't do that.\n\n36:09.800 --> 36:10.840\n And so, if they could do that,\n\n36:10.840 --> 36:13.880\n they could in theory send a person to Mars pretty soon.\n\n36:13.880 --> 36:15.720\n Now, taking off from Mars and coming back,\n\n36:15.720 --> 36:17.920\n again, I think, I don't think anyone want\n\n36:17.920 --> 36:20.320\n to be on that voyage today because there's just,\n\n36:20.320 --> 36:21.160\n you know, they're still in,\n\n36:21.160 --> 36:24.640\n it's still amateur hour here and getting that perfect.\n\n36:24.640 --> 36:25.960\n I don't think we're too far away now.\n\n36:25.960 --> 36:30.000\n The question is, so every 26 months,\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.720\n Earth laps Mars, right?\n\n36:31.720 --> 36:34.240\n It's like a sinusoidal, soil orbit\n\n36:34.240 --> 36:37.200\n or whatever it's called, the period, 26 months.\n\n36:37.200 --> 36:39.080\n So it's right now, like in the evens,\n\n36:39.080 --> 36:43.000\n like 2022 is gonna have one of these, late 2024.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.200\n So people could, this was the earliest estimate I heard.\n\n36:45.200 --> 36:48.920\n Elon said, maybe we can send people to Mars in 2024,\n\n36:48.920 --> 36:51.720\n you know, to land in early 2025.\n\n36:51.720 --> 36:54.360\n That is not gonna happen because that included 2022\n\n36:54.360 --> 36:58.480\n sending a cargo ship to Mars, maybe even a one in 2020.\n\n36:58.480 --> 37:00.080\n And so I think they're not quite on that schedule,\n\n37:00.080 --> 37:03.360\n but to win my bet, 2027, I have a chance\n\n37:03.360 --> 37:05.520\n and 2029, I have another chance.\n\n37:05.520 --> 37:06.880\n We're not very good at like backing up\n\n37:06.880 --> 37:07.720\n and seeing the big picture.\n\n37:07.720 --> 37:09.280\n We're very distracted by what's going on today\n\n37:09.280 --> 37:10.800\n and what we can believe\n\n37:10.800 --> 37:12.440\n because it's happening in front of our face.\n\n37:12.440 --> 37:15.400\n There's no way that humans gonna be landing on Mars\n\n37:15.400 --> 37:17.480\n and it's not gonna be the only thing\n\n37:17.480 --> 37:18.840\n everyone is talking about, right?\n\n37:18.840 --> 37:20.480\n I mean, it's gonna be the moon landing,\n\n37:20.480 --> 37:23.040\n but even bigger deal, going to another planet, right?\n\n37:23.040 --> 37:24.600\n And for it to start a colony,\n\n37:24.600 --> 37:27.080\n not just to, again, high five and come back.\n\n37:27.080 --> 37:31.720\n So this is like the 2020s, maybe the 2030s\n\n37:31.720 --> 37:33.160\n is gonna be the new 1960s.\n\n37:33.160 --> 37:34.240\n We're gonna have a space decade.\n\n37:34.240 --> 37:35.960\n I'm so excited about it.\n\n37:35.960 --> 37:38.040\n And again, it's one of the great leaps for all of life\n\n37:38.040 --> 37:40.480\n happening in our lifetimes, like that's wild.\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:43.720\n To paint a slightly cynical possibility,\n\n37:43.720 --> 37:46.080\n which I don't see happening,\n\n37:46.080 --> 37:49.240\n but I just wanna put sort of value into leadership.\n\n37:49.240 --> 37:52.560\n I think it wasn't obvious that the moon landing\n\n37:52.560 --> 37:55.000\n would be so exciting for all of human civilization.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.960\n Some of that have to do with the right speeches,\n\n37:56.960 --> 37:58.880\n with the space race.\n\n37:58.880 --> 38:01.720\n Like space, depending on how it's presented,\n\n38:01.720 --> 38:03.280\n can be boring.\n\n38:03.280 --> 38:07.600\n I don't think it's been that so far, but I've actually.\n\n38:07.600 --> 38:10.200\n I think space is quite boring right now.\n\n38:10.200 --> 38:13.840\n No, SpaceX is super, but like 10 years ago, space.\n\n38:13.840 --> 38:15.840\n Some writer, I forget who wrote,\n\n38:15.840 --> 38:17.680\n it's like the best magic trick in the show\n\n38:17.680 --> 38:18.560\n happened at the beginning.\n\n38:18.560 --> 38:20.640\n And now they're starting to do this like easy hazard.\n\n38:20.640 --> 38:21.720\n It's like, you can't go in that direction.\n\n38:21.720 --> 38:23.600\n And the line that this writer said is like,\n\n38:23.600 --> 38:28.480\n watching astronauts go up to the space station\n\n38:28.480 --> 38:29.800\n after watching the moon is like\n\n38:29.800 --> 38:31.840\n watching Columbus sail to Ibiza.\n\n38:31.840 --> 38:34.920\n It's just like, everything is so practical.\n\n38:34.920 --> 38:36.760\n You're going up to the space station, not to explore,\n\n38:36.760 --> 38:38.640\n but to do science experiments in microgravity.\n\n38:38.640 --> 38:41.560\n And you're sending rockets up,\n\n38:41.560 --> 38:43.120\n mostly here and there there's a probe,\n\n38:43.120 --> 38:45.600\n but mostly you're sending them up to put satellites\n\n38:45.600 --> 38:48.560\n for DirecTV or whatever it is.\n\n38:48.560 --> 38:51.880\n It's kind of like lame earth industry usage.\n\n38:51.880 --> 38:54.560\n So I agree with you, space is boring there.\n\n38:55.560 --> 38:59.760\n The first human setting foot on Mars,\n\n38:59.760 --> 39:01.680\n that's gotta be a crazy global event.\n\n39:01.680 --> 39:02.880\n I can't imagine it not being.\n\n39:02.880 --> 39:03.720\n Maybe you're right.\n\n39:03.720 --> 39:05.280\n Maybe I'm taking for granted the speeches\n\n39:05.280 --> 39:06.520\n and the space race and that.\n\n39:06.520 --> 39:09.920\n I think the value of, I guess what I'm pushing\n\n39:09.920 --> 39:12.080\n is the value of people like Elon Musk\n\n39:12.080 --> 39:14.480\n and potentially other leaders that hopefully step up\n\n39:14.480 --> 39:16.160\n is extremely important here.\n\n39:16.160 --> 39:19.240\n Like I would argue without the publicity of SpaceX,\n\n39:19.240 --> 39:21.360\n it's not just the ingenuity of SpaceX,\n\n39:21.360 --> 39:23.400\n but like what they've done publicly\n\n39:23.400 --> 39:25.720\n by having a figure that tweets\n\n39:25.720 --> 39:27.640\n and all that kind of stuff like that,\n\n39:27.640 --> 39:29.560\n that's a source of inspiration.\n\n39:29.560 --> 39:30.400\n Totally.\n\n39:30.400 --> 39:32.680\n NASA wasn't able to quite pull off with a shuttle.\n\n39:32.680 --> 39:35.000\n That's one of his two reasons for doing this.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.240\n SpaceX exists for two reasons.\n\n39:37.240 --> 39:40.160\n One, life insurance for the species.\n\n39:41.680 --> 39:42.560\n I always think about this way.\n\n39:42.560 --> 39:44.440\n If you're an alien on some far away planet\n\n39:44.440 --> 39:46.680\n and you're rooting against humanity\n\n39:46.680 --> 39:49.560\n and you win the bet if humanity goes extinct,\n\n39:49.560 --> 39:51.520\n you do not like SpaceX.\n\n39:51.520 --> 39:53.000\n You do not want them to have their eggs\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.160\n in two baskets now.\n\n39:54.160 --> 39:55.000\n Yeah.\n\n39:56.880 --> 39:59.440\n Sure, it's like obviously you could have something\n\n39:59.440 --> 40:00.600\n that kills everyone on both planets,\n\n40:00.600 --> 40:02.080\n some AI war or something.\n\n40:02.080 --> 40:06.840\n But the point is obviously it's good for our chances,\n\n40:06.840 --> 40:08.560\n our longterm chances to be having\n\n40:08.560 --> 40:11.320\n two self sustaining civilizations going on.\n\n40:11.320 --> 40:15.000\n The second reason, he values this I think just as high\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.360\n is it's the greatest adventure in history\n\n40:17.360 --> 40:21.000\n going multi planetary and that people need some reason\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:21.960\n to wake up in the morning\n\n40:21.960 --> 40:26.240\n and it'll just be this hopefully great uniting event too.\n\n40:26.240 --> 40:29.560\n I mean, today's nasty, awful political environment,\n\n40:29.560 --> 40:34.080\n which is like a whirlpool that sucks everything into it.\n\n40:34.080 --> 40:38.000\n So you name a thing and it's become a nasty political topic.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:42.720\n So I hope that space can,\n\n40:42.720 --> 40:44.760\n Mars can just bring everyone together,\n\n40:44.760 --> 40:46.920\n but it could become this hideous thing\n\n40:46.920 --> 40:48.640\n where it's a billionaire,\n\n40:48.640 --> 40:50.720\n some annoying storyline gets built.\n\n40:50.720 --> 40:53.160\n So half the people think that anyone who's excited about Mars\n\n40:53.160 --> 40:55.720\n is an evil something.\n\n40:55.720 --> 40:57.920\n Anyway, I hope it is super exciting.\n\n40:57.920 --> 41:01.920\n So far space has been a uniting, inspiring thing.\n\n41:03.200 --> 41:06.000\n And in fact, especially during this time of a pandemic\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.960\n has been just a commercial entity\n\n41:08.960 --> 41:12.080\n putting out humans into space for the first time\n\n41:12.080 --> 41:15.240\n was just one of the only big sources of hope.\n\n41:15.240 --> 41:19.000\n Totally in awe, just like watching this huge skyscraper\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.440\n go up in the air, flip over, go back down and land.\n\n41:21.440 --> 41:23.160\n I mean, it just makes everyone just wanna sit back\n\n41:23.160 --> 41:25.000\n and clap and kinda like,\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:26.640\n the way I look at something like SpaceX\n\n41:26.640 --> 41:30.240\n is it makes me proud to be a human.\n\n41:30.240 --> 41:31.480\n And I think it makes a lot of people feel that way.\n\n41:31.480 --> 41:33.240\n It's like good for our self esteem.\n\n41:33.240 --> 41:34.080\n It's like, you know what?\n\n41:34.080 --> 41:35.640\n We're pretty, we have a lot of problems,\n\n41:35.640 --> 41:36.960\n but like we're kind of awesome.\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:39.000\n And if we can put people on Mars,\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.400\n sticking up an earth flag on Mars,\n\n41:41.400 --> 41:43.800\n like damn, we should be so proud\n\n41:43.800 --> 41:45.360\n of our like little family here.\n\n41:45.360 --> 41:46.440\n Like we did something cool.\n\n41:46.440 --> 41:51.160\n And by the way, I've made it clear to SpaceX people,\n\n41:51.160 --> 41:52.520\n including Elon, many times,\n\n41:52.520 --> 41:54.000\n and it's like once a year reminder\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.880\n that if they want to make this more exciting,\n\n41:56.880 --> 42:00.840\n they send the writer to Mars on the thing.\n\n42:00.840 --> 42:02.320\n And I'll blog about it.\n\n42:02.320 --> 42:04.920\n So I'm just continuing to throw this out there.\n\n42:04.920 --> 42:05.760\n On which trip?\n\n42:05.760 --> 42:07.480\n I'm trying to get them to send me to Mars.\n\n42:07.480 --> 42:08.840\n No, I understand that.\n\n42:08.840 --> 42:10.280\n So I just wanna clarify\n\n42:10.280 --> 42:12.400\n on which trip does the writer wanna go?\n\n42:12.400 --> 42:14.120\n I think my dream one, to be honest,\n\n42:14.120 --> 42:16.960\n would be like the Apollo eight,\n\n42:16.960 --> 42:19.720\n where they just looped around the moon and came back.\n\n42:19.720 --> 42:21.760\n Cause landing on Mars.\n\n42:22.680 --> 42:24.880\n Give you a lot of good content to write about.\n\n42:24.880 --> 42:26.200\n Great content, right?\n\n42:26.200 --> 42:28.680\n I mean, the amount of kind of high minded,\n\n42:28.680 --> 42:30.160\n and so I would go into the thing\n\n42:30.160 --> 42:34.080\n and I would blog about it and I'd be in microgravity.\n\n42:34.080 --> 42:35.480\n So I'd be bouncing around my little space.\n\n42:35.480 --> 42:37.040\n I get a little, they can just send me in a dragon.\n\n42:37.040 --> 42:38.520\n They don't need to do a whole starship.\n\n42:38.520 --> 42:41.840\n And I would bounce around and I would get to,\n\n42:41.840 --> 42:43.640\n I've always had a dream of going\n\n42:43.640 --> 42:47.280\n to like one of those nice jails for a year.\n\n42:47.280 --> 42:49.560\n Because I just have nothing to do besides like read books\n\n42:49.560 --> 42:51.520\n and no responsibilities and no social plans.\n\n42:51.520 --> 42:53.560\n So this is the ultimate version of that.\n\n42:53.560 --> 42:55.320\n Anyway, it's a side topic, but I think it would be.\n\n42:55.320 --> 42:57.280\n But also if you, I mean, to be honest,\n\n42:57.280 --> 43:00.040\n if you land on Mars, it's epic.\n\n43:00.040 --> 43:04.080\n And then if you die there of like finishing your writing,\n\n43:04.080 --> 43:06.600\n it will be just even that much more powerful\n\n43:06.600 --> 43:08.400\n for the impact.\n\n43:08.400 --> 43:09.760\n Yeah, but then I'm gone.\n\n43:09.760 --> 43:12.160\n And I don't even get to like experience the publication\n\n43:12.160 --> 43:14.360\n of it, which is the whole point of some of the greatest\n\n43:14.360 --> 43:16.920\n writers in history didn't get a chance to experience\n\n43:16.920 --> 43:18.080\n the publication of their.\n\n43:18.080 --> 43:19.800\n I know, I don't really think that I think like,\n\n43:19.800 --> 43:21.360\n I think back to Jesus and I'm like, oh man,\n\n43:21.360 --> 43:23.200\n that guy really like crushed it, you know?\n\n43:23.200 --> 43:24.800\n But then if you think about it,\n\n43:26.080 --> 43:28.360\n it doesn't like you could literally die today\n\n43:28.360 --> 43:31.280\n and then become the next Jesus, like 2000 years from now\n\n43:31.280 --> 43:33.560\n in this civilization that's like, there are, you know,\n\n43:33.560 --> 43:35.860\n they're like in magical in the clouds\n\n43:35.860 --> 43:38.760\n and they're worshiping you, they're worshiping Lex.\n\n43:38.760 --> 43:40.680\n And like, that sounds like your ego probably would be like,\n\n43:40.680 --> 43:43.120\n wow, that's pretty cool, except irrelevant to you\n\n43:43.120 --> 43:44.280\n because you never even knew it happened.\n\n43:44.280 --> 43:46.520\n This feels like a Rick and Morty episode.\n\n43:46.520 --> 43:47.960\n It does, it does.\n\n43:47.960 --> 43:51.760\n Okay, you've talked to Elon quite a bit,\n\n43:51.760 --> 43:53.880\n you've written about him quite a bit.\n\n43:53.880 --> 43:58.320\n Just, it'd be cool to hear you talk about\n\n43:58.320 --> 44:00.200\n what are your ideas of what, you know,\n\n44:00.200 --> 44:02.960\n the magic sauces you've written about with Elon.\n\n44:02.960 --> 44:06.080\n What makes him so successful?\n\n44:06.080 --> 44:09.040\n His style of thinking, his ambition, his dreams,\n\n44:09.040 --> 44:11.780\n his, the people he connects with,\n\n44:11.780 --> 44:13.120\n the kind of problems he tackles.\n\n44:13.120 --> 44:14.740\n Is there a kind of comments you can make\n\n44:14.740 --> 44:16.240\n about what makes him special?\n\n44:16.240 --> 44:18.480\n I think that obviously there's a lot of things\n\n44:18.480 --> 44:19.400\n that he's very good at.\n\n44:19.400 --> 44:23.240\n He has, he's obviously super intelligent.\n\n44:23.240 --> 44:25.940\n His heart is very much in like, I think the right place.\n\n44:25.940 --> 44:28.720\n Like, you know, I really, really believe that like,\n\n44:28.720 --> 44:30.120\n and I think people can sense that, you know,\n\n44:30.120 --> 44:32.840\n he just doesn't seem like a grifter of any kind.\n\n44:32.840 --> 44:34.560\n He's truly trying to do these big things\n\n44:34.560 --> 44:36.080\n for the right reasons.\n\n44:36.080 --> 44:38.360\n And he's obviously crazy ambitious and hardworking, right?\n\n44:38.360 --> 44:39.200\n Not everyone is.\n\n44:39.200 --> 44:40.880\n Some people are as talented and have cool visions,\n\n44:40.880 --> 44:43.800\n but they just don't wanna spend their life that way.\n\n44:43.800 --> 44:46.420\n So, but that's, none of those alone\n\n44:46.420 --> 44:48.120\n is what makes Elon, Elon.\n\n44:48.120 --> 44:49.840\n I mean, if it were, there'd be more of him\n\n44:49.840 --> 44:51.480\n because there's a lot of people that are very smart\n\n44:51.480 --> 44:53.920\n and smart enough to accumulate a lot of money and influence\n\n44:53.920 --> 44:56.920\n and they have great ambition and they have, you know,\n\n44:56.920 --> 44:58.800\n their hearts in the right place.\n\n44:58.800 --> 45:01.980\n To me, it is the very unusual quality he has\n\n45:01.980 --> 45:04.020\n is that he's sane in a way\n\n45:04.020 --> 45:06.360\n that almost every human is crazy.\n\n45:06.360 --> 45:08.800\n What I mean by that is we are programmed\n\n45:10.480 --> 45:15.480\n to trust conventional wisdom over our own reasoning\n\n45:17.560 --> 45:19.120\n for good reason.\n\n45:19.120 --> 45:22.800\n If you go back 50,000 years and conventional wisdom says,\n\n45:22.800 --> 45:26.020\n you know, don't eat that berry, you know,\n\n45:26.020 --> 45:28.980\n or this is the way you tie a spearhead to a spear.\n\n45:29.920 --> 45:31.680\n And you're thinking, I'm smarter than that.\n\n45:31.680 --> 45:32.640\n Like, you're not.\n\n45:32.640 --> 45:35.080\n You know, that comes from the accumulation\n\n45:35.080 --> 45:37.040\n of life experience, accumulation of observation\n\n45:37.040 --> 45:39.640\n and experience over many generations.\n\n45:39.640 --> 45:41.760\n And that's a little mini version\n\n45:41.760 --> 45:43.360\n of the collective super intelligence.\n\n45:43.360 --> 45:45.360\n It's like, you know, it's equivalent\n\n45:45.360 --> 45:46.640\n of like making a pencil today.\n\n45:46.640 --> 45:51.640\n Like people back then, like the conventional wisdom,\n\n45:51.840 --> 45:54.160\n like had this super, this knowledge\n\n45:54.160 --> 45:56.080\n that no human could ever accumulate.\n\n45:56.080 --> 45:57.720\n So we're very wired to trust it.\n\n45:57.720 --> 46:00.820\n Plus the secondary thing is that the people who, you know,\n\n46:00.820 --> 46:02.720\n just say that they believe the mountain is,\n\n46:02.720 --> 46:04.680\n they worship the mountain as their God, right?\n\n46:04.680 --> 46:06.120\n And the mountain determines their fate.\n\n46:06.120 --> 46:07.340\n That's not true, right?\n\n46:07.340 --> 46:08.600\n And the conventional wisdom is wrong there,\n\n46:08.600 --> 46:12.720\n but believing it was helpful to survival\n\n46:12.720 --> 46:15.280\n because you were part of the crowd\n\n46:15.280 --> 46:16.120\n and you stayed in the tribe.\n\n46:16.120 --> 46:20.240\n And if you started to, you know, insult the mountain God\n\n46:20.240 --> 46:22.220\n and say, that's just a mountain, it's not, you know,\n\n46:22.220 --> 46:23.320\n you didn't fare very well, right?\n\n46:23.320 --> 46:25.840\n So for a lot of reasons, it was a great survival trait\n\n46:25.840 --> 46:29.400\n to just trust what other people said and believe it.\n\n46:29.400 --> 46:30.720\n And truly, you know, obviously, you know,\n\n46:30.720 --> 46:32.960\n the more you really believed it, the better.\n\n46:32.960 --> 46:37.960\n Today, conventional wisdom in a rapidly changing world\n\n46:39.880 --> 46:42.400\n and a huge giant society,\n\n46:42.400 --> 46:44.160\n our brains are not built to understand that.\n\n46:44.160 --> 46:45.680\n They have a few settings, you know,\n\n46:45.680 --> 46:47.760\n and none of them is, you know,\n\n46:47.760 --> 46:49.560\n 300 million person society.\n\n46:49.560 --> 46:52.500\n So your brain is basically,\n\n46:54.840 --> 46:57.740\n is treating a lot of things like a small tribe,\n\n46:57.740 --> 46:58.580\n even though they're not,\n\n46:58.580 --> 47:01.600\n and they're treating conventional wisdom as, you know,\n\n47:01.600 --> 47:03.640\n very wise in a way that it's not.\n\n47:03.640 --> 47:05.800\n If you think about it this way, it's like, picture a,\n\n47:05.800 --> 47:08.180\n like a bucket that's not moving very much,\n\n47:08.180 --> 47:09.480\n moving like a millimeter a year.\n\n47:09.480 --> 47:11.200\n And so it has time to collect a lot of water in it.\n\n47:11.200 --> 47:12.600\n That's like conventional wisdom in the old days\n\n47:12.600 --> 47:13.640\n when very few things changed.\n\n47:13.640 --> 47:15.900\n Like your 10, you know, great, great, great grandmother\n\n47:15.900 --> 47:17.040\n probably lived a similar life to you,\n\n47:17.040 --> 47:19.280\n maybe on the same piece of land.\n\n47:19.280 --> 47:21.140\n And so old people really knew what they were talking about.\n\n47:21.140 --> 47:23.360\n Today, the bucket's moving really quickly.\n\n47:23.360 --> 47:25.160\n And so, you know, the wisdom doesn't accumulate,\n\n47:25.160 --> 47:27.240\n but we think it does because our brain settings\n\n47:27.240 --> 47:29.020\n doesn't have the, oh, move, you know,\n\n47:29.020 --> 47:31.480\n quickly moving bucket setting on it.\n\n47:31.480 --> 47:35.660\n So my grandmother gives me advice all the time,\n\n47:35.660 --> 47:38.460\n and I have to decide, is this,\n\n47:38.460 --> 47:40.220\n so there are certain things that are not changing,\n\n47:40.220 --> 47:42.760\n like relationships and love and loyalty\n\n47:42.760 --> 47:44.020\n and things like this.\n\n47:44.020 --> 47:45.740\n Her advice on those things, I'll listen to it all day.\n\n47:45.740 --> 47:46.840\n She's one of the people who said,\n\n47:46.840 --> 47:48.520\n you've got to live near your people you love,\n\n47:48.520 --> 47:50.020\n live near your family, right?\n\n47:50.020 --> 47:52.840\n I think that is like tremendous wisdom, right?\n\n47:52.840 --> 47:54.440\n That is wisdom, because that's happens to be something\n\n47:54.440 --> 47:56.640\n that hasn't, doesn't change from generation to generation.\n\n47:56.640 --> 47:57.480\n For now.\n\n47:57.480 --> 47:59.660\n Right, she all, right, for now.\n\n47:59.660 --> 48:01.560\n She's also telling, right, so I'll be the idiot\n\n48:01.560 --> 48:03.400\n telling my brain that they'll actually be in the,\n\n48:03.400 --> 48:05.760\n it's a metaverse, like being like, it doesn't matter.\n\n48:05.760 --> 48:07.480\n And I'm like, you have to, it's not the same\n\n48:07.480 --> 48:08.320\n when you're not in person.\n\n48:08.320 --> 48:10.440\n They're gonna say, it's exactly the same, grandpa.\n\n48:10.440 --> 48:12.560\n And they'll also be thinking to me with their near link,\n\n48:12.560 --> 48:13.920\n and I'm gonna be like, slow down.\n\n48:13.920 --> 48:15.000\n I don't understand what you're saying.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:16.600\n You just talk like a normal person.\n\n48:16.600 --> 48:19.520\n Anyway, so my grandmother then, but then she says,\n\n48:19.520 --> 48:21.320\n you know, you're, I don't know about this writing\n\n48:21.320 --> 48:23.100\n you're doing, you should go to law school,\n\n48:23.100 --> 48:25.160\n and you know, you want to be secure.\n\n48:25.160 --> 48:26.800\n And that's not good advice for me.\n\n48:26.800 --> 48:28.080\n You know, given the world I'm in,\n\n48:28.080 --> 48:30.720\n and what I like to do, and what I'm good at,\n\n48:30.720 --> 48:31.820\n that's not the right advice.\n\n48:31.820 --> 48:33.960\n But because the world is totally,\n\n48:33.960 --> 48:34.800\n she's in a different world.\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:37.480\n So she became wise for a world that's no longer here, right?\n\n48:37.480 --> 48:38.820\n Now, if you think about that,\n\n48:38.820 --> 48:40.620\n so then when we think about conventional wisdom,\n\n48:40.620 --> 48:41.820\n it's a little like my grandmother,\n\n48:41.820 --> 48:45.080\n and there's a lot of, no, it's not maybe, you know,\n\n48:45.080 --> 48:47.160\n 60 years outdated like her software.\n\n48:47.160 --> 48:50.240\n It's maybe 10 years outdated conventional wisdom,\n\n48:50.240 --> 48:51.540\n sometimes 20.\n\n48:51.540 --> 48:55.540\n So anyway, I think that we all continually\n\n48:55.540 --> 48:58.540\n don't have the confidence in our own reasoning\n\n48:58.540 --> 49:00.760\n when it conflicts with what everyone else thinks,\n\n49:00.760 --> 49:02.800\n when with what seems right.\n\n49:02.800 --> 49:06.140\n We don't have the guts to act on that reasoning\n\n49:06.140 --> 49:07.080\n for that reason, right?\n\n49:07.080 --> 49:11.000\n You know, we, and so there's so many Elon examples.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:12.240\n I mean, just from the beginning,\n\n49:12.240 --> 49:14.720\n building Zip2 was his first company.\n\n49:15.640 --> 49:19.400\n And it was internet advertising at the time\n\n49:19.400 --> 49:22.120\n when people said, you know, this internet was brand new,\n\n49:22.120 --> 49:24.000\n like kind of thinking of like the metaverse,\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:24.880\n VR metaverse today.\n\n49:24.880 --> 49:27.000\n And people would be like, oh, we, you know,\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.120\n we facilitate internet advertising.\n\n49:29.120 --> 49:30.720\n People were saying, yeah, people are gonna advertise\n\n49:30.720 --> 49:32.000\n on the internet, yeah, right.\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.720\n Actually, it wasn't that he's magical and saw the future,\n\n49:34.720 --> 49:36.240\n it's that he looked at the present,\n\n49:36.240 --> 49:38.480\n looked at what the internet was,\n\n49:38.480 --> 49:40.920\n thought about, you know, the obvious\n\n49:40.920 --> 49:43.960\n like advertising opportunity this was gonna be.\n\n49:43.960 --> 49:45.320\n It wasn't rocket science.\n\n49:45.320 --> 49:46.760\n It wasn't genius, I don't believe.\n\n49:46.760 --> 49:48.840\n I think it was just seeing the truth.\n\n49:48.840 --> 49:50.200\n And when everyone else is laughing,\n\n49:50.200 --> 49:51.520\n saying, well, you're wrong.\n\n49:51.520 --> 49:54.720\n I mean, I did the math and here it is, right?\n\n49:54.720 --> 49:56.760\n Next company, you know, x.com,\n\n49:56.760 --> 49:58.540\n which became eventually PayPal.\n\n49:59.640 --> 50:00.720\n People said, oh yeah, people are gonna put\n\n50:00.720 --> 50:02.760\n their financial information on the internet.\n\n50:02.760 --> 50:03.600\n No way.\n\n50:05.160 --> 50:06.200\n To us, it seems so obvious.\n\n50:06.200 --> 50:08.040\n If you went back then, you would probably feel the same.\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:11.000\n You'd think this is, that is a fake company that no,\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:12.880\n it's just obviously not a good idea.\n\n50:12.880 --> 50:14.400\n He looked around and said, you know, I see where this is.\n\n50:14.400 --> 50:15.720\n And so again, he could see where it was going\n\n50:15.720 --> 50:17.240\n because he could see what it was that day\n\n50:17.240 --> 50:19.280\n and not what it, you know, not people, conventional wisdom\n\n50:19.280 --> 50:21.680\n was still a bunch of years earlier.\n\n50:21.680 --> 50:23.560\n SpaceX is the ultimate example.\n\n50:23.560 --> 50:25.000\n A friend of his apparently bought,\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:28.360\n actually compiled a montage, video montage\n\n50:28.360 --> 50:32.100\n of rockets blowing up to show him this is not a good idea.\n\n50:32.100 --> 50:34.480\n And if, but just even the bigger picture,\n\n50:34.480 --> 50:36.240\n the amount of billionaires who have like thought\n\n50:36.240 --> 50:38.800\n this was, I'm gonna start launching rockets\n\n50:38.800 --> 50:40.380\n and you know, the amount that failed.\n\n50:40.380 --> 50:43.560\n I mean, it's not, conventional wisdom said\n\n50:43.560 --> 50:44.640\n this isn't a bad endeavor.\n\n50:44.640 --> 50:45.960\n He was putting all of his money into it.\n\n50:45.960 --> 50:49.280\n Yeah, landing rockets was another thing.\n\n50:49.280 --> 50:50.520\n You know, well, if you know,\n\n50:50.520 --> 50:52.880\n here's the classic kind of way we reason,\n\n50:52.880 --> 50:55.480\n which is if this could be done,\n\n50:55.480 --> 50:57.280\n NASA would have done it a long time ago\n\n50:57.280 --> 50:58.620\n because of the money it would save.\n\n50:58.620 --> 50:59.760\n This could be done, the Soviet Union\n\n50:59.760 --> 51:01.680\n would have done it back in the sixties.\n\n51:01.680 --> 51:03.480\n It's obviously something that can't be done.\n\n51:03.480 --> 51:06.280\n And the math on his envelope said,\n\n51:06.280 --> 51:07.240\n well, I think it can be done.\n\n51:07.240 --> 51:08.140\n And so he just did it.\n\n51:08.140 --> 51:10.500\n So in each of these cases, I think actually in some ways,\n\n51:10.500 --> 51:12.280\n Elon gets too much credit as, you know,\n\n51:12.280 --> 51:13.940\n people think it's that he's, you know,\n\n51:13.940 --> 51:15.400\n it's that his Einstein intelligence\n\n51:15.400 --> 51:16.680\n or he can see the future.\n\n51:16.680 --> 51:19.560\n He has incredible, he has incredible guts.\n\n51:19.560 --> 51:20.820\n He's so, you know, courageous.\n\n51:20.820 --> 51:23.480\n I think if you actually are looking at reality\n\n51:24.760 --> 51:26.680\n and you're just assessing probabilities\n\n51:26.680 --> 51:29.160\n and you're ignoring all the noise, which is wrong,\n\n51:29.160 --> 51:30.320\n so wrong, right?\n\n51:30.320 --> 51:33.040\n And you just, then you just have to be, you know,\n\n51:33.040 --> 51:36.460\n pretty smart and pretty courageous.\n\n51:36.460 --> 51:39.720\n And you have to have this magical ability to be seen\n\n51:39.720 --> 51:42.240\n and trust your reasoning over conventional wisdom\n\n51:42.240 --> 51:44.560\n because your individual reasoning, you know,\n\n51:44.560 --> 51:46.800\n part of it is that we see that we can't build a pencil.\n\n51:46.800 --> 51:48.160\n We can't build, you know,\n\n51:48.160 --> 51:49.920\n this civilization on our own, right?\n\n51:49.920 --> 51:51.640\n So we kind of count, you know,\n\n51:51.640 --> 51:56.320\n count to the collective for good reasons.\n\n51:56.320 --> 51:57.840\n But this is different when it comes to kind of\n\n51:57.840 --> 51:59.200\n what's possible, you know,\n\n51:59.200 --> 52:02.800\n the Beatles were doing their kind of Motowny chord patterns\n\n52:02.800 --> 52:03.760\n in the early sixties.\n\n52:03.760 --> 52:05.560\n And they were doing what was normal.\n\n52:05.560 --> 52:08.900\n They were doing what was clearly this kind of sound is a hit.\n\n52:08.900 --> 52:10.040\n Then they started getting weird\n\n52:10.040 --> 52:11.480\n because they were so popular.\n\n52:11.480 --> 52:12.600\n They had this confidence to say,\n\n52:12.600 --> 52:15.160\n let's just, we're gonna start just experimenting.\n\n52:15.160 --> 52:17.200\n And it turns out that like,\n\n52:17.200 --> 52:18.560\n if you just, all these people are in this,\n\n52:18.560 --> 52:20.280\n like one groove together doing music,\n\n52:20.280 --> 52:22.920\n and it's just like, there's a lot of land over there.\n\n52:22.920 --> 52:24.480\n And it seems like, you know,\n\n52:24.480 --> 52:25.800\n I'm sure the managers would say,\n\n52:25.800 --> 52:28.040\n and that the, all the record execs would say,\n\n52:28.040 --> 52:29.000\n no, you have to be here.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:30.440\n This is what sells.\n\n52:30.440 --> 52:31.920\n And it's just not true.\n\n52:31.920 --> 52:33.280\n So I think that Elon is why,\n\n52:33.280 --> 52:35.320\n that's why the term for this\n\n52:35.320 --> 52:36.920\n that actually Elon likes to use\n\n52:36.920 --> 52:39.960\n is reasoning from first principles, the physics term.\n\n52:39.960 --> 52:41.720\n First principles are your axioms.\n\n52:41.720 --> 52:43.480\n And physicists, they don't say, well, what's,\n\n52:43.480 --> 52:44.960\n you know, what do people think?\n\n52:44.960 --> 52:46.340\n No, they say, what are the axioms?\n\n52:46.340 --> 52:47.320\n Those are the puzzle pieces.\n\n52:47.320 --> 52:49.320\n Let's use those to build a conclusion.\n\n52:49.320 --> 52:50.240\n That's our hypothesis.\n\n52:50.240 --> 52:51.280\n Now let's test it, right?\n\n52:51.280 --> 52:53.320\n And they come up with all kinds of new things\n\n52:53.320 --> 52:55.080\n constantly by doing that.\n\n52:55.080 --> 52:57.480\n If Einstein was assuming conventional wisdom was right,\n\n52:57.480 --> 52:59.400\n he never would have even tried to create something\n\n52:59.400 --> 53:02.120\n that really disproved Newton's laws.\n\n53:02.120 --> 53:05.480\n And the other way to reason is reasoning by analogy,\n\n53:05.480 --> 53:08.160\n which is a great shortcut.\n\n53:08.160 --> 53:10.500\n It's when we look at other people's reasoning\n\n53:10.500 --> 53:13.280\n and we kind of photocopy it into our head, we steal it.\n\n53:13.280 --> 53:15.940\n So reasoning by analogy, we do all the time.\n\n53:15.940 --> 53:17.040\n And it's usually a good thing.\n\n53:17.040 --> 53:19.620\n I mean, we don't, it takes a lot of mental energy and time\n\n53:19.620 --> 53:20.600\n to reason from first principles.\n\n53:20.600 --> 53:21.500\n It's actually, you know,\n\n53:21.500 --> 53:23.320\n you don't wanna reinvent the wheel every time, right?\n\n53:23.320 --> 53:26.400\n You want to often copy other people's reasoning\n\n53:26.400 --> 53:27.240\n most of the time.\n\n53:27.240 --> 53:28.720\n And I, you know, most of us do it most of the time\n\n53:28.720 --> 53:30.000\n and that's good, but there's certain moments\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:31.520\n when you're, forget just for a second,\n\n53:31.520 --> 53:34.500\n like succeeding in like the world of like Elon,\n\n53:34.500 --> 53:35.600\n just who you're gonna marry,\n\n53:35.600 --> 53:36.600\n where are you gonna settle down?\n\n53:36.600 --> 53:38.820\n How are you gonna raise your kids?\n\n53:38.820 --> 53:40.880\n How are you gonna educate your kids?\n\n53:40.880 --> 53:42.240\n How you should educate yourself?\n\n53:42.240 --> 53:43.720\n What kind of career paths in terms,\n\n53:43.720 --> 53:45.720\n these moments, this is what on your death bed,\n\n53:45.720 --> 53:47.120\n like you look back on and that's what,\n\n53:47.120 --> 53:49.280\n these are the few number of choices\n\n53:49.280 --> 53:50.480\n that really define your life.\n\n53:50.480 --> 53:52.280\n Those should not be reasoned by analogy.\n\n53:52.280 --> 53:55.200\n You should absolutely try to reason from first principles.\n\n53:55.200 --> 53:58.320\n And Elon, not just by the way in his work,\n\n53:58.320 --> 53:59.360\n but in his personal life.\n\n53:59.360 --> 54:01.440\n I mean, if you just look at the way he's on Twitter,\n\n54:01.440 --> 54:03.400\n he's not, it's not how you're supposed to be\n\n54:03.400 --> 54:07.280\n when you're a super famous, you know, industry titan.\n\n54:07.280 --> 54:08.880\n You're not supposed to just be silly on Twitter\n\n54:08.880 --> 54:11.840\n and do memes and getting little quibbles with you.\n\n54:11.840 --> 54:14.320\n He just does things his own way,\n\n54:14.320 --> 54:15.880\n regardless of what you're supposed to do,\n\n54:15.880 --> 54:17.640\n which sometimes serves him and sometimes doesn't,\n\n54:17.640 --> 54:21.520\n but I think it has taken him where it has taken him.\n\n54:21.520 --> 54:23.400\n Yeah, I mean, I probably wouldn't describe\n\n54:23.400 --> 54:26.000\n his approach to Twitter as first principles,\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:26.820\n but I guess it has the same element.\n\n54:26.820 --> 54:28.320\n I think it is.\n\n54:28.320 --> 54:30.060\n Well, first of all, I will say that a lot of tweets,\n\n54:30.060 --> 54:32.560\n people think, oh, like he's gonna be done after that.\n\n54:32.560 --> 54:35.440\n He's fine, he's just one man, time man of the year.\n\n54:35.440 --> 54:38.560\n Like it's something, it's not sinking him,\n\n54:38.560 --> 54:40.600\n and I think, you know, it's not that I think\n\n54:40.600 --> 54:41.760\n this is like super reasoned out.\n\n54:41.760 --> 54:43.440\n I think that, you know, Twitter is his silly side,\n\n54:43.440 --> 54:48.280\n but I think that he saw,\n\n54:48.280 --> 54:50.800\n his reasoning did not feel like there was a giant risk\n\n54:50.800 --> 54:52.520\n in just being his silly self on Twitter,\n\n54:52.520 --> 54:53.600\n when a lot of billionaires would say,\n\n54:53.600 --> 54:55.560\n well, no one else is doing that.\n\n54:55.560 --> 54:58.160\n So it must be a good reason, right?\n\n54:58.160 --> 55:01.120\n Well, I gotta say that he inspires me to,\n\n55:01.120 --> 55:02.880\n that's okay to be silly.\n\n55:02.880 --> 55:04.240\n Totally. On Twitter.\n\n55:04.240 --> 55:06.680\n And, but yeah, you're right.\n\n55:06.680 --> 55:09.000\n The big inspiration is the willingness to do that\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.040\n when nobody else is doing it.\n\n55:11.040 --> 55:13.280\n Yeah, and I think about all the great artists,\n\n55:13.280 --> 55:16.240\n you know, all the great inventors and entrepreneurs,\n\n55:16.240 --> 55:17.800\n almost all of them,\n\n55:17.800 --> 55:19.480\n they had a moment when they trusted their reasoning.\n\n55:19.480 --> 55:24.480\n I mean, Airbnb was over 60 with VCs.\n\n55:24.920 --> 55:25.840\n A lot of people would say,\n\n55:25.840 --> 55:28.960\n obviously they know something we don't, right?\n\n55:28.960 --> 55:30.680\n But they didn't, they said, eh, I think they're all wrong.\n\n55:30.680 --> 55:32.980\n I mean, that's, that takes some kind of different wiring\n\n55:32.980 --> 55:34.240\n in your brain.\n\n55:34.240 --> 55:36.440\n And then that's both for big picture\n\n55:36.440 --> 55:39.520\n and detailed like engineering problems.\n\n55:39.520 --> 55:40.800\n It's fun to talk to him.\n\n55:40.800 --> 55:42.200\n It's fun to talk to Jim Keller,\n\n55:42.200 --> 55:44.520\n who's a good example of this kind of thinking\n\n55:44.520 --> 55:47.560\n about like manufacturing, how to get costs down.\n\n55:47.560 --> 55:49.080\n They always talk about like,\n\n55:49.080 --> 55:52.240\n they talk about SpaceX rockets this way.\n\n55:52.240 --> 55:53.900\n They talk about manufacturing this way,\n\n55:53.900 --> 55:58.900\n like cost per pound or per ton to get to orbit\n\n56:01.200 --> 56:02.560\n or something like that.\n\n56:02.560 --> 56:04.640\n This is all the reason we need to get the cost down.\n\n56:04.640 --> 56:07.120\n It's a very kind of raw materials.\n\n56:07.120 --> 56:07.960\n Yeah.\n\n56:07.960 --> 56:10.520\n Like just very basic way of thinking.\n\n56:10.520 --> 56:11.680\n First principles.\n\n56:11.680 --> 56:12.920\n It's really, yeah.\n\n56:12.920 --> 56:14.040\n And the first principles of a rocket\n\n56:14.040 --> 56:16.400\n are like the price of raw materials\n\n56:16.400 --> 56:19.840\n and gravity, you know, and wind.\n\n56:19.840 --> 56:22.840\n I mean, these are your first principles and fuel.\n\n56:24.540 --> 56:29.160\n Henry Ford, you know, what made Henry Ford blow up\n\n56:29.160 --> 56:30.680\n as an entrepreneur?\n\n56:30.680 --> 56:32.040\n The assembly line, right?\n\n56:32.040 --> 56:35.160\n I mean, he thought for a second and said,\n\n56:35.160 --> 56:38.280\n this isn't how manufacturing is normally done this way,\n\n56:38.280 --> 56:40.680\n but I think this is a different kind of product.\n\n56:40.680 --> 56:42.040\n And that's what changed it.\n\n56:42.040 --> 56:43.640\n And then what happened is when someone reasons\n\n56:43.640 --> 56:45.280\n from first principles, they often fail.\n\n56:45.280 --> 56:47.640\n You know, you're going out into the fog\n\n56:47.640 --> 56:49.320\n with no conventional wisdom to guide you.\n\n56:49.320 --> 56:51.200\n But when you succeed, what you notice is that\n\n56:51.200 --> 56:52.800\n everyone else turns and says, wait, what, what?\n\n56:52.800 --> 56:53.640\n What are they doing?\n\n56:53.640 --> 56:55.220\n And they all, they flock over.\n\n56:55.220 --> 56:56.480\n Look at the iPhone.\n\n56:56.480 --> 56:58.780\n iPhone, you know, Steve Jobs was obviously famously good\n\n56:58.780 --> 57:00.120\n at reasoning from first principles\n\n57:00.120 --> 57:02.840\n because that guy had crazy self confidence.\n\n57:02.840 --> 57:04.840\n He just said, you know, if I think this is right,\n\n57:04.840 --> 57:06.320\n like everyone, and that, I mean, I don't know how,\n\n57:06.320 --> 57:07.520\n I don't know how he does that.\n\n57:07.520 --> 57:09.600\n And I don't think Apple can do that anymore.\n\n57:09.600 --> 57:10.440\n I mean, they lost that.\n\n57:10.440 --> 57:13.360\n That one brain, his ability to do that was made\n\n57:13.360 --> 57:14.800\n that in a totally different company,\n\n57:14.800 --> 57:17.280\n even though there's tens of thousands of people there.\n\n57:17.280 --> 57:20.200\n He said, he didn't say, and I'm giving a lot of credit\n\n57:20.200 --> 57:23.160\n to Steve Jobs, but of course it was a team at Apple\n\n57:23.160 --> 57:26.320\n who said they didn't look at the flip phones and say,\n\n57:26.320 --> 57:28.320\n okay, well kind of, you know, let's make a keyboard\n\n57:28.320 --> 57:30.040\n that's like clicky and, you know, really cool Apple.\n\n57:30.040 --> 57:32.440\n A keyboard, they said, what should a mobile device be?\n\n57:32.440 --> 57:35.640\n You know, what the axioms, what are the axioms here?\n\n57:35.640 --> 57:37.480\n And none of them involved a keyboard necessarily.\n\n57:37.480 --> 57:39.140\n And by the time they piece it up, there was no keyboards.\n\n57:39.140 --> 57:40.320\n It didn't make sense.\n\n57:40.320 --> 57:42.000\n Everyone suddenly is going, wait, what, what are they doing?\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:42.840\n What are they?\n\n57:42.840 --> 57:43.720\n And now every phone looks like the iPhone.\n\n57:43.720 --> 57:46.720\n I mean, that's, that's how it goes.\n\n57:46.720 --> 57:51.360\n You tweeted, what's something you've changed your mind about?\n\n57:51.360 --> 57:53.520\n That's the question you've tweeted.\n\n57:53.520 --> 57:55.920\n Elon replied, brain transplants,\n\n57:55.920 --> 57:58.020\n Sam Harris responded, nuclear power.\n\n57:58.020 --> 58:01.440\n There's a bunch of people with cool responses there.\n\n58:01.440 --> 58:02.600\n In general, what are your thoughts\n\n58:02.600 --> 58:03.800\n about some of the responses\n\n58:03.800 --> 58:07.480\n and what have you changed your mind about big or small,\n\n58:07.480 --> 58:10.560\n perhaps in doing the research for some of your writing?\n\n58:10.560 --> 58:13.800\n So I'm writing right now, just finishing a book\n\n58:13.800 --> 58:18.800\n on kind of why our society is such a shit place at the moment\n\n58:19.060 --> 58:20.160\n just polarized.\n\n58:20.160 --> 58:21.840\n And, you know, we have all these gifts\n\n58:21.840 --> 58:23.700\n like we're talking about, just the supermarket, you know,\n\n58:23.700 --> 58:25.660\n we have these, it's exploding technology.\n\n58:25.660 --> 58:28.040\n Fewer and fewer people are in poverty.\n\n58:28.040 --> 58:30.480\n You know, it's, Louis CK, you know, likes to say,\n\n58:30.480 --> 58:32.480\n you know, everything's amazing and no one's happy, right?\n\n58:32.480 --> 58:35.000\n But it's really extreme moment right now\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.400\n where it's like, hate is on the rise,\n\n58:37.400 --> 58:38.760\n like crazy things, right?\n\n58:38.760 --> 58:39.760\n And.\n\n58:39.760 --> 58:41.120\n If I could interrupt briefly,\n\n58:41.120 --> 58:43.400\n you did tweet that you just wrote the last word.\n\n58:43.400 --> 58:44.360\n I sure did.\n\n58:44.360 --> 58:46.980\n And then there's some hilarious asshole who said,\n\n58:46.980 --> 58:49.880\n now you just have to work on all the ones in the middle.\n\n58:49.880 --> 58:50.720\n Yeah, I've heard that.\n\n58:50.720 --> 58:53.000\n I mean, when you, when you earned a reputation\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.840\n as a tried and true procrastinator,\n\n58:55.840 --> 58:57.840\n you're just gonna get shit forever.\n\n58:57.840 --> 58:58.680\n And that's fine.\n\n58:58.680 --> 58:59.680\n I accept my fate there.\n\n58:59.680 --> 59:02.080\n So do you mind sharing a little bit more\n\n59:02.080 --> 59:03.760\n about the details of what you're writing?\n\n59:03.760 --> 59:07.880\n So you're, how do you approach this question\n\n59:07.880 --> 59:09.280\n about the state of society?\n\n59:09.280 --> 59:11.800\n I wanted to figure out what was going on\n\n59:11.800 --> 59:15.080\n because what I noticed was a bad trend.\n\n59:15.080 --> 59:16.440\n It's not that, you know, things are bad.\n\n59:16.440 --> 59:19.400\n It's that things are getting worse in certain ways.\n\n59:19.400 --> 59:20.240\n Not in every way.\n\n59:20.240 --> 59:23.160\n Look at Max Roser's stuff, you know,\n\n59:23.160 --> 59:24.920\n he comes up with all these amazing graphs.\n\n59:24.920 --> 59:27.400\n This is what's weird is that things are getting better\n\n59:27.400 --> 59:29.960\n in almost every important metric you can think of,\n\n59:31.640 --> 59:35.280\n except the amount of people who hate other people\n\n59:35.280 --> 59:36.680\n in their own country.\n\n59:36.680 --> 59:40.040\n And the amount of people that hate their own country,\n\n59:40.040 --> 59:42.640\n the amount of Americans that hate America's on the rise,\n\n59:42.640 --> 59:44.120\n right, the amount of Americans\n\n59:44.120 --> 59:47.200\n that hate other Americans is on the rise.\n\n59:47.200 --> 59:49.160\n The amount of Americans that hate the president\n\n59:49.160 --> 59:50.200\n is on the rise, all these things,\n\n59:50.200 --> 59:52.800\n like on a very steep rise.\n\n59:52.800 --> 59:53.720\n So what the hell?\n\n59:53.720 --> 59:54.560\n What's going on?\n\n59:54.560 --> 59:56.160\n Like there's something causing that.\n\n59:56.160 --> 59:58.320\n It's not that, you know, a bunch of new people were born\n\n59:58.320 --> 59:59.280\n who were just dicks.\n\n59:59.280 --> 1:00:01.320\n It's that something is going on.\n\n1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:04.120\n So I think of it as a very simple,\n\n1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:07.920\n oversimplified equation, human behavior.\n\n1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:09.880\n And it's the output.\n\n1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:12.040\n That I think the two inputs are human nature\n\n1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:13.120\n and environment, right?\n\n1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:14.520\n And this is basic, you know,\n\n1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:18.480\n super kindergarten level like, you know, animal behavior.\n\n1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.120\n But I think it's worth thinking about.\n\n1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:21.280\n You've got human nature,\n\n1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:24.040\n which is not changing very much, right?\n\n1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:27.600\n And then you got, you throw that nature\n\n1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:29.040\n into a certain environment\n\n1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:30.840\n and it reacts to the environment, right?\n\n1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:32.560\n It's shaped by the environment.\n\n1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:36.480\n And then eventually what comes out is behavior, right?\n\n1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:38.040\n Human nature is not changing very much,\n\n1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:40.320\n but suddenly we're behaving differently, right?\n\n1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:42.600\n We are, again, you know, look at the polls.\n\n1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:45.160\n Like it used to be that the president, you know,\n\n1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:47.080\n was liked by, I don't remember the exact numbers,\n\n1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:51.200\n but, you know, 80% or 70% of their own party\n\n1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:53.040\n and, you know, 50% of the other party.\n\n1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:54.680\n And now it's like 40% of their own party\n\n1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:56.120\n and 10% of the other party, you know?\n\n1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:59.360\n It's, and it's not that the presidents are getting worse.\n\n1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:00.760\n Maybe some people would argue that they are,\n\n1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:04.000\n but more so, and there's a lot of, you know,\n\n1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.720\n idiot presidents throughout the,\n\n1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:08.320\n what's going on is something in the environment is changing.\n\n1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:11.240\n And that's, you're seeing is a change in behavior.\n\n1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:12.840\n A easy example here is that, you know,\n\n1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:14.080\n by a lot of metrics,\n\n1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:18.240\n racism is getting, is becoming less and less of a problem.\n\n1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:21.880\n You know, it's hard to measure, but there's metrics like,\n\n1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:23.320\n you know, how upset would you be\n\n1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:26.560\n if your kid married someone of another race?\n\n1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:28.040\n And that number is plummeting,\n\n1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:30.840\n but racial grievance is skyrocketing, right?\n\n1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:32.040\n There's a lot of examples like this.\n\n1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:33.640\n So I wanted to look around and say,\n\n1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:34.760\n and the reason I took it on,\n\n1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:36.840\n the reason I don't think this is just an unfortunate trend,\n\n1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:38.920\n unpleasant trend that hopefully we come out of,\n\n1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:40.480\n is that all this other stuff I like to write about,\n\n1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:42.000\n all this future stuff, right?\n\n1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.760\n And it's this magical, I always think of this,\n\n1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:45.280\n like I'm very optimistic in a lot of ways.\n\n1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:48.480\n And I think that our world would be a utopia,\n\n1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:50.160\n would seem like actual heaven.\n\n1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:53.680\n Like whatever Thomas Jefferson was picturing as heaven,\n\n1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:55.440\n other than maybe the eternal life aspect,\n\n1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:59.200\n I think that if he came to 2021 US, it would be better.\n\n1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:00.920\n It's cooler than heaven.\n\n1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:03.880\n But we live in a place that's cooler than 1700s heaven.\n\n1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:05.640\n Again, other than the fact that we still die.\n\n1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:07.240\n Now, I think the future world\n\n1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:09.640\n actually probably would have, quote, eternal life.\n\n1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:12.000\n I don't think anyone wants eternal life actually,\n\n1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.320\n if people think they do.\n\n1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:14.560\n Eternal is a long time.\n\n1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:16.920\n But I think the choice to die when you want,\n\n1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:19.400\n maybe we're uploaded, maybe we can refresh our bodies.\n\n1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:20.240\n I don't know what it is.\n\n1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:23.400\n But the point is, I think about that utopia.\n\n1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:25.920\n And I do believe that like, if we don't botch this,\n\n1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:27.120\n we'd be heading towards somewhere\n\n1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:30.040\n that would seem like heaven, maybe in our lifetimes.\n\n1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:32.920\n Of course, if things go wrong,\n\n1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:34.880\n now think about the trends here.\n\n1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:36.960\n Just like the 20th century would seem like\n\n1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:39.680\n some magical utopia to someone from the 16th century.\n\n1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:43.880\n But the bad things in the 20th century\n\n1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:46.160\n were kind of the worst things ever\n\n1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:48.000\n in terms of just absolute magnitude.\n\n1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.080\n World War II, the biggest genocides ever.\n\n1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:55.080\n You've got maybe climate change,\n\n1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:58.400\n if it is the existential threat that many people think it is.\n\n1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:01.040\n We never had an existential threat on that level before.\n\n1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:04.000\n So the good is getting better and the bad is getting worse.\n\n1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.400\n And so what I think about the future,\n\n1:03:05.400 --> 1:03:10.400\n I think of us as some kind of big, long canoe as a species.\n\n1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:14.920\n 5 million mile long canoe, each of us sitting in a row.\n\n1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:16.280\n And we each have one oar,\n\n1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:18.520\n and we can paddle on the left side or the right side.\n\n1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:21.960\n And what we know is there's a fork up there somewhere.\n\n1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:26.000\n And the river forks, and there's a utopia on one side\n\n1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.200\n and a dystopia on the other side.\n\n1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:28.560\n And I really believe that that's,\n\n1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:30.440\n we're probably not headed for just an okay future.\n\n1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:32.400\n It's just the way tech is exploding,\n\n1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:34.200\n like it's probably gonna be really good or really bad.\n\n1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:35.800\n The question is which side should we be rowing on?\n\n1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:37.720\n We can't see up there, right?\n\n1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:38.560\n But it really matters.\n\n1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:39.560\n So I'm writing about all this future stuff\n\n1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:40.600\n and I'm saying none of this matters\n\n1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:43.040\n if we're squabbling our way into kind of like\n\n1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:44.380\n a civil war right now.\n\n1:03:44.380 --> 1:03:45.720\n So what's going on?\n\n1:03:45.720 --> 1:03:48.540\n So it's a really important problem to solve.\n\n1:03:48.540 --> 1:03:51.820\n What are your sources of hope in this?\n\n1:03:51.820 --> 1:03:54.880\n So like how do you steer the canoe?\n\n1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:56.280\n One of my big sources of hope,\n\n1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:59.840\n and this is I think my answer to what I changed my mind on,\n\n1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:03.640\n is I think I always knew this, but it's easy to forget it.\n\n1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:05.540\n Our primitive brain does not remember this fact,\n\n1:04:05.540 --> 1:04:10.260\n which is that I don't think there are very many bad people.\n\n1:04:11.140 --> 1:04:13.560\n Now, you say bad, are there selfish people?\n\n1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:16.340\n Most of us, I think that if you think of people,\n\n1:04:18.140 --> 1:04:21.560\n there's digital languages, ones and zeros.\n\n1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:24.040\n And our primitive brain very quickly can get into the land\n\n1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:25.000\n where everyone's a one or a zero.\n\n1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.880\n Our tribe, we're all ones, we're perfect.\n\n1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:28.760\n I'm perfect, my family is that other family,\n\n1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:29.600\n it's that other tribe.\n\n1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:31.760\n There are zeros and then you dehumanize them, right?\n\n1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:33.880\n These people are awful.\n\n1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:36.140\n So zero is not a human place.\n\n1:04:36.140 --> 1:04:37.640\n No one's a zero and no one's a one.\n\n1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:39.200\n You're dehumanizing yourself.\n\n1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:41.040\n So when we get into this land,\n\n1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:42.640\n I call it political Disney world,\n\n1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:44.760\n because the Disney movies have good guys.\n\n1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:48.640\n Scar is totally bad and Mufasa is totally good, right?\n\n1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.320\n You don't see Mufasa's character flaws.\n\n1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:52.960\n You don't see Scar's upbringing that made him like that,\n\n1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:53.800\n that humanizes him.\n\n1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:55.520\n No, lionizes him, whatever.\n\n1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:56.760\n You are.\n\n1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:57.600\n Well done.\n\n1:04:57.600 --> 1:05:01.760\n Mufasa's a one and Scar's a zero, very simple.\n\n1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:03.640\n So political Disney world is a place,\n\n1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.640\n it's a psychological place that all of us have been in.\n\n1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:08.160\n And it can be religious Disney world,\n\n1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:10.960\n it can be national Disney world and the war, whatever it is,\n\n1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:13.320\n but it's a place where we fall into this delusion\n\n1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:14.800\n that there are protagonists and antagonists\n\n1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:15.680\n and that's it, right?\n\n1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:16.920\n That is not true.\n\n1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:20.880\n We are all 0.5s or maybe 0.6s to 0.4s in that.\n\n1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:22.600\n We are also, on one hand,\n\n1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:24.400\n I don't think there's that many really great people,\n\n1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:26.160\n frankly, I think if you get into it,\n\n1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:27.760\n people are kind of, a lot of people,\n\n1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:29.480\n most of us have, if you get really\n\n1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:31.120\n into our most shameful memories,\n\n1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:32.360\n the things we've done that are worse,\n\n1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:33.400\n the most shameful thoughts,\n\n1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:35.040\n the deep selfishness that some of us have\n\n1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:37.080\n in areas we wouldn't want to admit, right?\n\n1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:40.520\n Most of us have a lot of unadmirable stuff, right?\n\n1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.440\n On the other hand, if you actually got into,\n\n1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:44.240\n really got into someone else's brain\n\n1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:45.320\n and you looked at their upbringing,\n\n1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:47.080\n you looked at the trauma that they've experienced\n\n1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:49.600\n and then you looked at the insecurities they have\n\n1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:50.440\n and you look at all their,\n\n1:05:50.440 --> 1:05:53.600\n if you assemble the highlight reel of your worst moments,\n\n1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:55.480\n the meanest things you've ever done,\n\n1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:56.640\n the worst, the most selfish,\n\n1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:58.440\n the times you stole something, whatever,\n\n1:05:58.440 --> 1:05:59.280\n and you just, people are like,\n\n1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:00.920\n wow, Lex is an awful person.\n\n1:06:00.920 --> 1:06:01.760\n If you highlighted your,\n\n1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:03.560\n if you did a montage of your best moments,\n\n1:06:03.560 --> 1:06:05.000\n people would say, oh, he's a god, right?\n\n1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.760\n But of course, we all have both of those.\n\n1:06:06.760 --> 1:06:11.480\n So, I've started to really try to remind myself\n\n1:06:11.480 --> 1:06:13.680\n that everyone's a 0.5, right?\n\n1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:15.880\n And 0.5s are all worthy of criticism\n\n1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:17.720\n and we're all worthy of compassion.\n\n1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:19.840\n And the thing that makes me hopeful\n\n1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:22.640\n is that I really think that there's a bunch of 0.5s\n\n1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:24.720\n and 0.5s are good enough\n\n1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:26.480\n that we should be able to create a good society together.\n\n1:06:26.480 --> 1:06:28.040\n There's a lot of love in every human.\n\n1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:30.440\n And I think there's more love in humans than hate.\n\n1:06:32.080 --> 1:06:34.360\n I always remember this moment,\n\n1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:35.600\n this is a weird anecdote,\n\n1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:38.000\n but I'm a Red Sox fan, Boston Red Sox baseball,\n\n1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.440\n and Derek Jeter is who we hate the most.\n\n1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:41.360\n He's on the Yankees.\n\n1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:42.400\n Yes.\n\n1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:44.720\n And hate, right?\n\n1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:45.840\n Jeter, right?\n\n1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:47.960\n He was his last game in Fenway, he's retiring.\n\n1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:49.800\n And he got this rousing standing ovation\n\n1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:50.960\n and I almost cried.\n\n1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:52.480\n And it was like, what is going on?\n\n1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:53.320\n We hate this guy,\n\n1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:56.080\n but actually there's so much love in all humans.\n\n1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:58.640\n It felt so good to just give a huge cheer\n\n1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:00.840\n to this guy we hate because it's like this moment\n\n1:07:00.840 --> 1:07:02.280\n of like a little fist pound being like,\n\n1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.000\n of course we all actually love each other.\n\n1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.200\n And I think there's so much of that.\n\n1:07:06.200 --> 1:07:08.120\n And so the thing that I think I've come around on\n\n1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:11.160\n is I think that we are in an environment\n\n1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:13.280\n that's bringing out really bad stuff.\n\n1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.800\n I don't think it's, if I thought it was the people,\n\n1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:16.640\n I would be more hopeful.\n\n1:07:16.640 --> 1:07:17.640\n Like if I thought it was human nature,\n\n1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:19.720\n I'd be more upset.\n\n1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:23.120\n It's the two independent variables here,\n\n1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:24.480\n or that there's a fixed variable.\n\n1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:25.840\n There's a constant, which is human nature.\n\n1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:27.680\n And there's the independent variable environment\n\n1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:30.480\n and that it behaviors the dependent variable.\n\n1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:32.360\n I like that the thing that I think is bad\n\n1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:34.520\n is the independent variable, the environment,\n\n1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:35.800\n which means I think we can,\n\n1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:36.840\n the environment can get better.\n\n1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:38.040\n And there's a lot of things I can go into\n\n1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:39.800\n about why the environment I think is bad,\n\n1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:42.760\n but I have hope because I think the thing that's bad for us\n\n1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:44.480\n is something that can change.\n\n1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:47.520\n The first principles idea here is that most people\n\n1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:51.640\n have the capacity to be a 0.7 to 0.9.\n\n1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:56.640\n If the environment is properly calibrated\n\n1:07:56.880 --> 1:07:57.960\n with the right incentives.\n\n1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.160\n I think that, well, I think that maybe if we're all,\n\n1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:01.680\n yeah, if we're all 0.5s,\n\n1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:05.480\n I think that environments can bring out our good side.\n\n1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:08.880\n Yeah, so maybe we're all on some kind of distribution\n\n1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:11.000\n and the right environment can, yes,\n\n1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.720\n can bring out our higher sides.\n\n1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:15.080\n And I think a lot of, in a lot of ways you could say it has.\n\n1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:17.760\n I mean, the U.S. environment,\n\n1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:20.880\n we take for granted how the liberal laws\n\n1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:23.000\n and liberal environment that we live in.\n\n1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.240\n I mean, like in New York City, right?\n\n1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:29.360\n If you walk down the street and you like assault someone,\n\n1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:31.000\n hey, if anyone sees you, they're probably gonna yell at you.\n\n1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.920\n You might get your ass kicked by someone for doing that.\n\n1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:35.640\n You also might end up in jail, you know,\n\n1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:38.040\n if it's security cameras and there's just norms,\n\n1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:38.880\n you know, we're all trained.\n\n1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:40.320\n That's what awful people do, right?\n\n1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:42.240\n So there's, it's not the human nature\n\n1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:44.280\n doesn't have it in it to be like that.\n\n1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:47.480\n It's that this environment we're in has made that a much,\n\n1:08:47.480 --> 1:08:50.120\n much, much smaller experience for people.\n\n1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:51.960\n There's so many examples like that where it's like,\n\n1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:54.520\n man, you don't realize how much of the worst human nature\n\n1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:56.200\n is contained by our environment.\n\n1:08:56.200 --> 1:08:58.800\n And, but I think that, you know,\n\n1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:00.240\n rapidly changing environment,\n\n1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:02.240\n which is what we have right now, social media starts.\n\n1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:04.680\n I mean, what a seismic change to the environment.\n\n1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:05.760\n There's a lot of examples like that,\n\n1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:06.920\n rapidly changing environment\n\n1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:09.240\n can create rapidly changing behavior\n\n1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:11.680\n and wisdom sometimes can't keep up.\n\n1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:15.800\n And so we, you know, we can really kind of lose our grip\n\n1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:17.280\n on some of the good behavior.\n\n1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:21.760\n Were you surprised by Elon's answer about brain transplants\n\n1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:24.480\n or Sam's about nuclear power or anything else?\n\n1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:25.320\n Just...\n\n1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:27.760\n Sam's I think is, I have a friend,\n\n1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:29.800\n Isabel Boumeke who has a,\n\n1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:33.120\n who's a nuclear power, you know, influencer.\n\n1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:34.920\n I've become very convinced\n\n1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:37.960\n and I've not done my deep dive on this.\n\n1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:39.920\n But here's, in this case, this is,\n\n1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:41.640\n this is reasoning by analogy here.\n\n1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:45.120\n The amount of really smart people I respect\n\n1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:46.920\n who all, who seem to have dug in,\n\n1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:49.960\n who all say nuclear power is clearly a good option.\n\n1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:51.840\n It's obviously emission free, but you know,\n\n1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:54.120\n the concerns about meltdowns and waste,\n\n1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:56.840\n they see that they're completely overblown.\n\n1:09:56.840 --> 1:10:00.240\n So judging from those people, secondary knowledge here,\n\n1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:02.720\n I will say I'm a strong advocate.\n\n1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.200\n I haven't done my own deep dive yet,\n\n1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.480\n but it does seem like a little bit odd\n\n1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:08.200\n that you've got people\n\n1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:10.400\n who are so concerned about climate change,\n\n1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:15.320\n who have, it seems like it's kind of an ideology\n\n1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:17.160\n where nuclear power doesn't fit\n\n1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:20.320\n rather than rational, you know, fear of climate change\n\n1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:22.160\n that somehow is anti nuclear power.\n\n1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:23.160\n It just, yeah.\n\n1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:26.600\n I personally am uncomfortably reasoning by analogy\n\n1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:27.920\n with climate change.\n\n1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:29.680\n I've actually have not done a deep dive myself.\n\n1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:31.800\n Me neither, because it's so,\n\n1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:33.280\n man, it seems like a deep dive.\n\n1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:37.200\n And my reasoning by analogy there\n\n1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.600\n currently has me thinking it's a truly existential thing,\n\n1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:41.800\n but feeling hopeful.\n\n1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:44.320\n So let me, this is me speaking\n\n1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:45.720\n and this is speaking from a person\n\n1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:47.160\n who's not done the deep dive.\n\n1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.480\n I'm a little suspicious\n\n1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:52.920\n of the amount of fear mongering going on.\n\n1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:54.680\n Especially over the past couple of years,\n\n1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:56.600\n I've gotten uncomfortable with fear mongering\n\n1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:59.120\n in all walks of life.\n\n1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:01.480\n There's way too many people interested\n\n1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:04.200\n in manipulating the populace with fear.\n\n1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:05.440\n And so I don't like it.\n\n1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:06.880\n I should probably do a deep dive\n\n1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:10.600\n because to me it's, well, the big problem\n\n1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:13.120\n with the opposition to climate change\n\n1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:15.120\n or whatever the fear mongering is\n\n1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:19.720\n that it also grows the skepticism in science broadly.\n\n1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:20.920\n It's like, and that,\n\n1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:23.440\n so I need to make sure I do that deep dive.\n\n1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:25.080\n I have listened to a few folks\n\n1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:27.800\n who kind of criticize the fear mongering\n\n1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:29.080\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:30.800\n but they're few and far between.\n\n1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:33.760\n And so it's like, all right, what is the truth here?\n\n1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:36.120\n And it feels lazy, but it also feels like\n\n1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:37.400\n it's hard to get to the,\n\n1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:43.040\n like there's a lot of kind of activists talking about idea,\n\n1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:48.040\n versus like sources of objective,\n\n1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:52.480\n like calm first principles type reasoning.\n\n1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:54.120\n Like one of the things,\n\n1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:57.880\n I know it's supposed to be a very big problem,\n\n1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:00.000\n but when people talk about catastrophic effects\n\n1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.680\n of climate change,\n\n1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:06.360\n I haven't been able to like see really great deep analysis\n\n1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:09.480\n of what that looks like in 10, 20, 30 years,\n\n1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:12.400\n raising rising sea levels.\n\n1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:17.000\n What are the models of how that changes human behavior,\n\n1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.280\n society, what are the things that happen?\n\n1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:21.640\n There's going to be constraints on the resources\n\n1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:23.360\n and people are gonna have to move around.\n\n1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:24.920\n This is happening gradually.\n\n1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:26.720\n Are we gonna be able to respond to this?\n\n1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:27.840\n How would we respond to this?\n\n1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:28.920\n What are the best,\n\n1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:30.400\n like, what are the best models\n\n1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:32.280\n for how everything goes wrong?\n\n1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:36.200\n Again, I was, this is a question I keep starting\n\n1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.640\n to ask myself without doing any research,\n\n1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:43.400\n like motivating myself to get up to this deep dive\n\n1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:45.040\n that I feel is deep,\n\n1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:47.200\n just watching people not do a great job\n\n1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:49.480\n with that kind of modeling with the pandemic\n\n1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:52.640\n and sort of being caught off guard and wondering,\n\n1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:55.120\n okay, if we're not good with this pandemic,\n\n1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:57.560\n how are we going to respond to other kinds of tragedies?\n\n1:12:57.560 --> 1:12:59.400\n Well, this is part of why I wrote the book.\n\n1:12:59.400 --> 1:13:04.200\n Cause I said, we're going to have more and more of these,\n\n1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:08.160\n like big collective, what should we do here situations?\n\n1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:09.680\n Whether it's, how about when, you know,\n\n1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:10.720\n we're probably not that far away\n\n1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:14.480\n from people being able to go and decide the IQ of their kid\n\n1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:15.920\n or like, you know, make a bunch of embryos\n\n1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:18.640\n and actually pick the highest IQ.\n\n1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:19.960\n Can possibly go wrong.\n\n1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:20.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:22.960\n And also like, imagine the political sides of that\n\n1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:25.160\n and like something that only wealthy people can afford at\n\n1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:27.320\n first and just the nightmare, right?\n\n1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:29.600\n We need to be able to have our wits about us as a species\n\n1:13:29.600 --> 1:13:32.840\n where we can actually get into a topic like that\n\n1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:36.680\n and come up with where the collective brain can be smart.\n\n1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:39.360\n I think that there are certain topics\n\n1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:41.240\n where I think of this and this is again,\n\n1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:43.080\n another simplistic model, but I think it works\n\n1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:45.200\n is that there's a higher mind and a primitive mind, right?\n\n1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:47.200\n You can, you know, in your head\n\n1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:48.880\n and these team up with others.\n\n1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:50.800\n So when the higher minds are in a higher mind\n\n1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:52.960\n is more rational and puts out ideas\n\n1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.000\n that it's not attached to.\n\n1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.400\n And so it can change its mind easily\n\n1:13:56.400 --> 1:13:58.440\n cause it's just an idea and the higher mind\n\n1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:00.360\n can get criticized.\n\n1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:02.840\n Their ideas can get criticized and it's no big deal.\n\n1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:05.000\n And so when the higher minds team up,\n\n1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.440\n it's like all these people in the room,\n\n1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:07.880\n like throwing out ideas and kicking them\n\n1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:10.000\n and one idea goes out and everyone criticizes it,\n\n1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.760\n which is like, you know, shooting bows and arrows at it.\n\n1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:13.960\n And the truth, the true idea is, you know,\n\n1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:16.000\n the bow, the arrows bounce off and it's so, okay,\n\n1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.280\n it rises up and the other ones get shot down.\n\n1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:19.520\n So it's this incredible system.\n\n1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:20.360\n This is what, you know,\n\n1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:22.480\n this is what good science institution is,\n\n1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:24.000\n is, you know, someone puts out a thing,\n\n1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.240\n criticism arrows come at it and, you know,\n\n1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:29.000\n most of them fall and the needle is in the haystack\n\n1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.040\n end up rising up, right?\n\n1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:30.920\n Incredible mechanism.\n\n1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:32.480\n So what that's happening is a bunch of people,\n\n1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:34.760\n a bunch of flawed medium scientists\n\n1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:36.480\n are creating super intelligence.\n\n1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:40.440\n Then there's the primitive mind,\n\n1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:44.120\n which, you know, is the more limbic system part of our brain.\n\n1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:48.680\n It's the part of us that is very much not living in 2021.\n\n1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:51.280\n It's living many tens of thousands of years ago.\n\n1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:54.240\n And it does not treat ideas like this separate thing.\n\n1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:56.320\n It identifies with its ideas.\n\n1:14:56.320 --> 1:14:59.880\n It only gets involved when it finds an idea sacred.\n\n1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:02.040\n It starts holding an idea sacred and it starts identifying.\n\n1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:04.280\n So what happens is they team up too.\n\n1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:08.280\n And so when you have a topic that a bunch of primitive,\n\n1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:10.480\n that really rouses a bunch of primitive minds,\n\n1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:14.880\n it quickly, the primitive minds team up\n\n1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:16.600\n and they create an echo chamber\n\n1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:18.400\n where suddenly no one can criticize this.\n\n1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:20.640\n And in fact, if it's powerful enough,\n\n1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:22.040\n people outside the community, you can,\n\n1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:22.880\n no one can criticize it.\n\n1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:23.960\n We will get your paper retracted.\n\n1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:25.760\n We will get you fired, right?\n\n1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:27.040\n That's not higher mind behavior.\n\n1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:28.520\n That is crazy primitive mind.\n\n1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:30.520\n And so now what happens is the collective\n\n1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:32.560\n becomes dumber than an individual,\n\n1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:34.880\n a dumber than a reason, a single reasoning individual.\n\n1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:37.040\n You have this collective is suddenly attached\n\n1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:40.720\n to this sacred scripture with the idea\n\n1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:43.160\n and they will not change their mind\n\n1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:44.240\n and they get dumber and dumber.\n\n1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:47.240\n And so climate change, what's worrisome\n\n1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:49.480\n is that climate change has in many ways\n\n1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:50.920\n become a sacred topic,\n\n1:15:50.920 --> 1:15:52.520\n where if you come up with a nuanced thing,\n\n1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:54.600\n you might get called branded a denier.\n\n1:15:54.600 --> 1:15:57.640\n So there goes the super intelligence,\n\n1:15:57.640 --> 1:15:59.480\n all the arrows, no arrows can be fired.\n\n1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:01.000\n But if you get called a denier,\n\n1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.440\n that's a social penalty for firing an arrow\n\n1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:05.080\n at a certain orthodoxy, right?\n\n1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:06.880\n And so what's happening is the big brain\n\n1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:08.000\n gets like frozen, right?\n\n1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:08.880\n And it becomes very stupid.\n\n1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:10.520\n Now, you can also say that\n\n1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:12.560\n about a lot of other topics right now.\n\n1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:16.560\n You just mentioned another one, I forget what it was,\n\n1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:19.000\n but that's also kind of like this.\n\n1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:20.280\n The world of vaccine.\n\n1:16:20.280 --> 1:16:21.520\n Yeah, yeah, COVID, okay.\n\n1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:23.360\n And here's my point earlier is that\n\n1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:25.760\n what I see is that the political divide\n\n1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:28.320\n has like a whirlpool that's pulling everything into it.\n\n1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:32.000\n And in that whirlpool, thinking is done\n\n1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.880\n with the primitive mind tribes.\n\n1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:38.520\n And so I get, okay, obviously something like race,\n\n1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:40.240\n that makes sense, that also right now,\n\n1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:42.160\n the topic of race, for example, or gender,\n\n1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:43.840\n these things are in the whirlpool.\n\n1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:45.680\n But that at least is like, okay,\n\n1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:47.080\n that's something that the primitive mind\n\n1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:49.160\n would always get really worked up about.\n\n1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:52.280\n It taps into like our deepest kind of like primal selves.\n\n1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:56.080\n COVID, maybe it's COVID in a way too,\n\n1:16:56.080 --> 1:16:57.920\n but climate change, that should just be something\n\n1:16:57.920 --> 1:16:58.880\n that our rational brains are like,\n\n1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:00.360\n let's solve this complex problem.\n\n1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:02.360\n But the problem is that it's all gotten sucked\n\n1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:04.280\n into the red versus blue whirlpool.\n\n1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:05.120\n And once that happens,\n\n1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:06.320\n it's in the hands of the primitive minds.\n\n1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:09.160\n And we're losing our ability to be wise together,\n\n1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:10.680\n to make decisions.\n\n1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:13.360\n It's like the big species brain is like,\n\n1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:15.200\n or the big American brain is like,\n\n1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:16.760\n drunk at the wheel right now.\n\n1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.160\n And we're about to go into our future\n\n1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:21.120\n with more and more big technologies,\n\n1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:23.160\n scary things, we have to make big right decisions.\n\n1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:26.040\n And not, we're getting dumber as a collective.\n\n1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:28.400\n And that's part of this environmental problem.\n\n1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:30.320\n So within the space of technologists\n\n1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:33.280\n and the space of scientists, we should allow the arrows.\n\n1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:35.040\n That's one of the saddest things to me about,\n\n1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:39.960\n is like the scientists, like I've seen arrogance.\n\n1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:42.440\n There's a lot of mechanisms that maintain the tribe.\n\n1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:46.520\n It's the arrogance, it's how you built up this mechanism\n\n1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:50.080\n that defends, this wall that defends against the arrows.\n\n1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:54.280\n It's arrogance, credentialism,\n\n1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:58.200\n like just ego, really.\n\n1:17:58.200 --> 1:17:59.560\n And then just, it protects you\n\n1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:01.960\n from actually challenging your own ideas.\n\n1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:05.640\n This ideal of science that makes science beautiful.\n\n1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:09.600\n In a time of fear, and in a time of division\n\n1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:12.880\n created by perhaps politicians that leverage the fear,\n\n1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:16.200\n it, like you said, makes the whole system dumber.\n\n1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:17.840\n The science system dumber,\n\n1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:22.680\n the tech developer system dumber,\n\n1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:24.840\n if they don't allow the challenging of ideas.\n\n1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:27.320\n What's really bad is that like,\n\n1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:28.600\n in a normal environment,\n\n1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:30.560\n you're always gonna have echo chambers.\n\n1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:32.320\n So what's the opposite of an echo chamber?\n\n1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:34.120\n I created a term for it, because I think we need it,\n\n1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:36.520\n which is called an idea lab, an idea lab, right?\n\n1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:38.920\n It's like people treat, it's like people act like scientists,\n\n1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:40.440\n even if they're not doing science,\n\n1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:43.400\n they just treat their ideas like science experiments\n\n1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:45.320\n and they toss them out there and everyone disagrees.\n\n1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:46.880\n And disagreement is like the game.\n\n1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:48.360\n Everyone likes to disagree.\n\n1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:50.880\n Certain texts thread where everyone is just saying,\n\n1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:52.240\n it's almost like someone throws something out\n\n1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:54.120\n and just it's an impulse for the rest of the group to say,\n\n1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:56.600\n I think you're being like overly general there.\n\n1:18:56.600 --> 1:18:58.320\n Or I think like, aren't you kind of being,\n\n1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:00.160\n I think that's like your bias showing.\n\n1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:01.560\n And it's like, no one's getting offended\n\n1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:02.760\n because it's like, we're all just messing,\n\n1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:04.840\n we all of course respect each other, obviously.\n\n1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:08.440\n We're just, you know, trashing each other's ideas\n\n1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:10.600\n and that the whole group becomes smarter.\n\n1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:12.600\n You're always gonna have idea labs and echo chambers,\n\n1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:13.520\n right, in different communities.\n\n1:19:13.520 --> 1:19:15.640\n And most of us participate in both of them.\n\n1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:18.000\n You know, maybe in your marriage is a great idea lab,\n\n1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.800\n you love to disagree with your spouse and maybe in,\n\n1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:23.000\n but this group of friends or your family at home,\n\n1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:24.400\n you know, in front of that sister,\n\n1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:25.600\n you do not bring up politics\n\n1:19:25.600 --> 1:19:27.520\n because she's now enforced when that happens,\n\n1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:30.240\n her bullying is forcing the whole room\n\n1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:32.840\n to be an echo chamber to appease her.\n\n1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:35.280\n Now, what scares me is that usually have these things\n\n1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:36.880\n existing kind of in bubbles.\n\n1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:39.000\n And usually there's like an age\n\n1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.560\n have their natural defenses against each other.\n\n1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:44.200\n So an echo chamber person stays in their echo chamber.\n\n1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:45.680\n They don't like, they will cut you out.\n\n1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:47.240\n They don't like to be friends with people\n\n1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:48.080\n who disagree with them.\n\n1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:49.120\n You notice that they will cut you out.\n\n1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:50.200\n They'll cut out their parents\n\n1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:51.560\n if they voted for Trump or whatever, right?\n\n1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:54.400\n So that's how they do it.\n\n1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:56.000\n They will say, I'm going to stay inside\n\n1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:57.120\n of an echo chamber safely.\n\n1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:59.280\n So my ideas, which I identify with\n\n1:20:00.680 --> 1:20:02.400\n because my primitive mind is doing the thinking\n\n1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:04.040\n are not going to ever have to get challenged\n\n1:20:04.040 --> 1:20:07.320\n because it feels so scary and awful for that to happen.\n\n1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:09.560\n But if they leave and they go into an idea lab environment,\n\n1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:10.640\n they're going to, people are going to say, what?\n\n1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:11.760\n No, they're going to disagree.\n\n1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:12.600\n And they're going to say,\n\n1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:13.680\n and the person's going to try to bully them.\n\n1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:15.600\n They're going to say, that's really offensive.\n\n1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:16.520\n And people are going to say, no, it's not.\n\n1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:17.920\n And they're going to immediately say\n\n1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:19.120\n these people are assholes, right?\n\n1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:21.840\n So the echo chamber person,\n\n1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:24.600\n it doesn't have much power once they leave the echo chamber.\n\n1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:26.120\n Likewise, the idea lab person,\n\n1:20:26.120 --> 1:20:27.240\n they have this great environment,\n\n1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:28.560\n but if they go into an echo chamber\n\n1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:29.960\n where everyone else is, and they do that,\n\n1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:30.960\n they will get kicked out of the group.\n\n1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.440\n They will get branded as something,\n\n1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:36.640\n a denier, a racist, a right winger, a radical,\n\n1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:38.200\n these nasty words.\n\n1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:41.400\n The thing that I don't like right now\n\n1:20:41.400 --> 1:20:44.720\n is that the echo chambers have found ways\n\n1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:48.400\n to forcefully expand into places\n\n1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:51.240\n that normally have a pretty good immune system\n\n1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:53.440\n against echo chambers, like universities,\n\n1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:54.960\n like science journals,\n\n1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:56.240\n places where usually it's like,\n\n1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:59.000\n there's a strong idea lab culture there, veritas.\n\n1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.680\n You know, that's an idea lab slogan.\n\n1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:06.120\n You have is that these people have found a way to,\n\n1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:07.840\n a lot of people have found a way\n\n1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:09.000\n to actually go out of their thing\n\n1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.160\n and keep their echo chamber\n\n1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:11.920\n by making sure that everyone is scared\n\n1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:13.000\n because they can punish anyone,\n\n1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000\n whether you're in their community or not.\n\n1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:19.120\n So that's all brilliantly put.\n\n1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:20.720\n When's the book coming out?\n\n1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:21.560\n Any idea?\n\n1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:24.000\n June, July, we're not quite sure yet.\n\n1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.360\n Okay, I can't wait.\n\n1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:26.360\n Thanks. It's awesome.\n\n1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:28.160\n Do you have a title yet or you can't talk about that?\n\n1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:29.000\n Still working on it.\n\n1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.520\n Okay.\n\n1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:32.920\n If it's okay, just a couple of questions from Mailbag.\n\n1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:34.280\n I just love these.\n\n1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:37.440\n I would love to hear you riff on these.\n\n1:21:37.440 --> 1:21:39.560\n So one is about film and music.\n\n1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:41.960\n Why do we prefer to watch, the question goes,\n\n1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:43.800\n why do we prefer to watch a film\n\n1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:45.560\n we haven't watched before,\n\n1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:47.560\n but we want to listen to songs\n\n1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:50.080\n that we have heard hundreds of times?\n\n1:21:50.080 --> 1:21:51.840\n This question and your answer\n\n1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:53.280\n really started to make me think like,\n\n1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:54.440\n yeah, that's true.\n\n1:21:54.440 --> 1:21:55.760\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:21:55.760 --> 1:21:59.080\n Like we draw that line somehow.\n\n1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:00.240\n So what's the answer?\n\n1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:02.720\n So I think, let's use these two minds again.\n\n1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:04.440\n I think that when your higher mind\n\n1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:06.160\n is the one who's taking something in\n\n1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:07.400\n and they're really interested in,\n\n1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:08.760\n what are the lyrics or I'm gonna learn something\n\n1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:11.480\n or reading a book or whatever.\n\n1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:15.840\n And the higher mind is trying to get information.\n\n1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:16.680\n And once it has it,\n\n1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:17.920\n there's no point in listening to it again.\n\n1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:19.040\n It has the information.\n\n1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:21.920\n Your rational brain is like, I got it.\n\n1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:27.440\n But when you eat a good meal or have sex or whatever,\n\n1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:28.800\n that's something you can do again and again,\n\n1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:32.720\n because it actually, your primitive brain loves it.\n\n1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:35.360\n And it never gets bored of things that it loves.\n\n1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:38.120\n So I think music is a very primal thing.\n\n1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:40.480\n I think music goes right into our primitive brain.\n\n1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:43.880\n A lot, I think it's of course, it's a collaboration.\n\n1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:47.480\n Your rational brain is absorbing the actual message.\n\n1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:48.920\n But I think it's all about emotions\n\n1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:50.040\n and even more than emotions,\n\n1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:53.400\n it literally like the music taps into like some very,\n\n1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:58.400\n very deep, primal part of us.\n\n1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:02.040\n And so when you hear a song once,\n\n1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:03.240\n even some of your favorite songs,\n\n1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:04.080\n the first time you heard it,\n\n1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:05.840\n you were like, I guess that's kind of catchy.\n\n1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:07.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:07.320 --> 1:23:10.200\n And then you end up loving it on the 10th listen.\n\n1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:11.560\n But sometimes you even don't even like a song.\n\n1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:12.480\n You're like, oh, this song sucks.\n\n1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:15.200\n But suddenly you find yourself on the 40th time\n\n1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:16.200\n because it's on the radio all the time,\n\n1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:17.360\n just kind of being like, oh, I love this song.\n\n1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:19.640\n And you're like, wait, I hated the song.\n\n1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:23.000\n And what's happening is that the sound is actually,\n\n1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:27.160\n the music's actually carving a pathway in your brain\n\n1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:29.120\n and it's a dance.\n\n1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:30.920\n And when your brain knows what's coming,\n\n1:23:30.920 --> 1:23:33.040\n it can dance, it knows the steps.\n\n1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:35.720\n So your brain is your internal kind of,\n\n1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:37.520\n your brain is actually dancing with the music\n\n1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:40.360\n and it knows the steps and it can anticipate.\n\n1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:45.040\n And so there's something about knowing,\n\n1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:46.120\n having memorized the song\n\n1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:48.920\n that makes it incredibly enjoyable to us.\n\n1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:49.960\n But when we hear it for the first time,\n\n1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:50.800\n we don't know where it's gonna go.\n\n1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:51.640\n We're like an awkward dancer.\n\n1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:53.360\n We don't know the steps and your primitive brain\n\n1:23:53.360 --> 1:23:55.280\n can't really have that much fun yet.\n\n1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:56.120\n That's how I feel.\n\n1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:59.800\n And in the movies, that's less primitive.\n\n1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:03.640\n That's the story you're taking in.\n\n1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:05.680\n But a really good movie that we really love,\n\n1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:07.600\n often we will watch it like 12 times.\n\n1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:09.200\n It's still like it, not that many,\n\n1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:11.880\n but versus if you're watching a talk show, right?\n\n1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:14.160\n If you're listening to one of your podcasts,\n\n1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:15.280\n as a perfect example,\n\n1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:16.320\n there's not many people that will listen\n\n1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:17.720\n to one of your podcasts,\n\n1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:19.040\n no matter how good it is, 12 times.\n\n1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:21.360\n Because once you've got it, you've got it.\n\n1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:25.320\n It's a form of information that's very higher mind focused.\n\n1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:26.160\n That's how I read it.\n\n1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:28.760\n Well, the funny thing is there is people\n\n1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:32.200\n that listen to a podcast episode many, many times.\n\n1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:33.960\n And often I think the reason for that\n\n1:24:33.960 --> 1:24:36.120\n is not because of the information, is the chemistry,\n\n1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:38.080\n is the music of the conversation.\n\n1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:38.920\n So it's not the actual.\n\n1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:40.280\n It's the art of it they like.\n\n1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:42.360\n Yeah, they'll fall in love with some kind of person,\n\n1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:45.320\n some weird personality, and they'll just be listening to,\n\n1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:47.800\n they'll be captivated by the beat of that kind of person.\n\n1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:48.640\n Or like a standup comic.\n\n1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:49.720\n I've watched like certain things,\n\n1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:52.320\n like episodes like 20 times, even though I, you know.\n\n1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:56.440\n I have to ask you about the wizard hat.\n\n1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:58.080\n You had a blog about Neuralink.\n\n1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:00.520\n I got a chance to visit Neuralink a couple of times,\n\n1:25:00.520 --> 1:25:05.520\n hanging out with those folks, that was one of the pieces\n\n1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:09.280\n of writing you did that like changes culture\n\n1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:12.040\n and changes the way people think about a thing.\n\n1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:15.880\n The ridiculousness of your stick figure drawings\n\n1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:20.880\n are somehow, it's like calling the origin\n\n1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:23.320\n of the universe the Big Bang.\n\n1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:25.840\n It's a silly title, but it somehow sticks\n\n1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:28.960\n to be the representative of that.\n\n1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:31.000\n And the same way the wizard hat for the Neuralink\n\n1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.480\n is somehow it was a really powerful way to explain that.\n\n1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:37.800\n You actually proposed that the man of the year\n\n1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:39.760\n cover of Time should be.\n\n1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:40.600\n One of my drawings.\n\n1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:41.440\n One of your drawings.\n\n1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:42.280\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:43.280\n It's an outrage that it wasn't.\n\n1:25:43.280 --> 1:25:44.200\n It wasn't.\n\n1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:49.080\n Okay, so what are your thoughts about like all those years\n\n1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:50.760\n later about Neuralink?\n\n1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:54.280\n Do you find this idea, like what excites you about it?\n\n1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:56.880\n Is it the big long term philosophical things?\n\n1:25:56.880 --> 1:25:58.360\n Is it the practical things?\n\n1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:00.560\n Do you think it's super difficult to do\n\n1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:02.120\n on the neurosurgery side\n\n1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:05.120\n and the material engineering, the robotics side?\n\n1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:08.200\n Or do you think the machine learning side\n\n1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:09.520\n for the brain computer interfaces\n\n1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:11.240\n where they get to learn about each other,\n\n1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:12.080\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:13.320\n I would just love to get your thoughts\n\n1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:14.280\n because you're one of the people\n\n1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:17.060\n that really considered this problem,\n\n1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:19.640\n really studied it, brain computer interfaces.\n\n1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:21.760\n I mean, I'm super excited about it.\n\n1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:24.800\n It's a, I really think it's actually\n\n1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:27.400\n Elon's most ambitious thing.\n\n1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:28.720\n More than colonizing Mars\n\n1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:31.160\n because that's just a bunch of people going somewhere,\n\n1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:33.160\n even though it's somewhere far.\n\n1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:37.680\n Neuralink is changing what a person is eventually.\n\n1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:42.420\n Now, I think that Neuralink engineers and Elon himself\n\n1:26:42.420 --> 1:26:45.120\n would all be the first to admit that it is a maybe\n\n1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:46.920\n that whether they can do their goals here.\n\n1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:50.320\n I mean, it is so crazy ambitious to try to,\n\n1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:52.280\n even their eventual goals are,\n\n1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:53.960\n of course in the interim,\n\n1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:55.120\n they have a higher probability\n\n1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:56.200\n of accomplishing smaller things,\n\n1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:59.660\n which are still huge, like basically solving paralysis,\n\n1:27:01.200 --> 1:27:02.640\n strokes, Parkinson, things like that.\n\n1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:03.960\n I mean, it can be unbelievable.\n\n1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:06.360\n And anyone who doesn't have one of these things,\n\n1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:08.880\n like we might, everyone should be very happy\n\n1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.760\n about this kind of helping with different disabilities.\n\n1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:17.140\n But the thing that is like,\n\n1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:21.480\n so the grand goal is this augmentation\n\n1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:23.600\n where you take someone who's totally healthy\n\n1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:26.240\n and you put a brain machine interface in any way\n\n1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:27.720\n to give them superpowers.\n\n1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:32.280\n It's the possibilities if they can do this,\n\n1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:33.120\n if they can really,\n\n1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:36.520\n so they've already shown that they are for real,\n\n1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:38.600\n but they've created this robot.\n\n1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:40.700\n Elon talks about like, it should be like LASIK,\n\n1:27:40.700 --> 1:27:42.040\n where it's not,\n\n1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:44.240\n it shouldn't be something that needs a surgeon.\n\n1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:46.520\n This shouldn't just be for rich people\n\n1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:48.220\n who have waited in line for six months.\n\n1:27:48.220 --> 1:27:50.280\n It should be for anyone who can afford LASIK\n\n1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:53.160\n and eventually, hopefully something that isn't covered by\n\n1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:56.320\n insurance or something that anyone can do.\n\n1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:57.760\n Something this big a deal should be something\n\n1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:00.200\n that anyone can afford eventually.\n\n1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:03.160\n And when we have this, again,\n\n1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:05.720\n I'm talking about a very advanced phase down the road.\n\n1:28:05.720 --> 1:28:07.600\n So maybe a less advanced phase,\n\n1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:11.000\n just maybe right now,\n\n1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.260\n if you think about when you listen to a song,\n\n1:28:13.260 --> 1:28:16.760\n what's happening, is you actually hear the sound?\n\n1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:18.600\n Well, not really.\n\n1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:22.260\n It's that the sound is coming out of the speaker.\n\n1:28:22.260 --> 1:28:23.520\n The speaker is vibrating.\n\n1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:25.080\n It's vibrating air molecules.\n\n1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:26.800\n Those air molecules, you know,\n\n1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:31.740\n get vibrated all the way to your head pressure wave.\n\n1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:34.500\n And then it vibrates your eardrum.\n\n1:28:34.500 --> 1:28:37.060\n Your eardrum is really the speaker now in your head\n\n1:28:37.060 --> 1:28:40.320\n that then vibrates bones and fluid,\n\n1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:44.840\n which then stimulates neurons in your auditory cortex,\n\n1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:49.800\n which give you the perception that you're hearing sound.\n\n1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:52.240\n Now, if you think about that,\n\n1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:55.120\n do we really need to have a speaker to do that?\n\n1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:56.080\n You could just somehow,\n\n1:28:56.080 --> 1:28:56.920\n if you had a little tiny thing\n\n1:28:56.920 --> 1:28:57.960\n that could vibrate eardrums,\n\n1:28:57.960 --> 1:28:59.280\n you could do it that way.\n\n1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:00.880\n That seems very hard.\n\n1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:02.160\n But really what you need,\n\n1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:03.240\n if you go to the very end\n\n1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:05.000\n with a thing that really needs to happen,\n\n1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.080\n is your auditory cortex neurons\n\n1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:09.640\n need to be stimulated in a certain way.\n\n1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:11.920\n If you have a ton of Neuralink things in there,\n\n1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:13.320\n Neuralink electrodes,\n\n1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:15.920\n and they get really good at stimulating things,\n\n1:29:15.920 --> 1:29:17.680\n you could play a song in your head\n\n1:29:17.680 --> 1:29:20.520\n that you hear that is not playing anywhere.\n\n1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:21.920\n There's no sound in the room,\n\n1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:23.720\n but you hear and no one else could.\n\n1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:25.280\n It's not like they can get close to your head and hear it.\n\n1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:26.120\n There's no sound.\n\n1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:27.200\n They could not hear anything,\n\n1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:28.360\n but you hear sound.\n\n1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:29.180\n You can turn up.\n\n1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:30.140\n So you open your phone,\n\n1:29:30.140 --> 1:29:31.320\n you have the Neuralink app.\n\n1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:32.640\n You open the Neuralink app,\n\n1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:34.080\n and or just Neuralink.\n\n1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:35.600\n So basically you can open your Spotify\n\n1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:38.800\n and you can play to your speaker,\n\n1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:39.680\n you can play to your computer,\n\n1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:41.240\n you can play right out of your phone to your headphones,\n\n1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:43.400\n or you can have a new one.\n\n1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:44.680\n You can play into your brain.\n\n1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:47.160\n And this is one of the earlier things.\n\n1:29:47.160 --> 1:29:49.820\n This is something that seems like really doable.\n\n1:29:50.660 --> 1:29:52.280\n So no more headphones.\n\n1:29:52.280 --> 1:29:53.300\n I always think it's so annoying\n\n1:29:53.300 --> 1:29:55.840\n because I can leave the house with just my phone\n\n1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:57.600\n and nothing else,\n\n1:29:57.600 --> 1:29:58.440\n or even just an Apple watch.\n\n1:29:58.440 --> 1:29:59.280\n But there's always this one thing,\n\n1:29:59.280 --> 1:30:00.120\n I'm like, and headphones.\n\n1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:01.440\n You do need your headphones, right?\n\n1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:03.100\n So I feel like that'll be the end of that.\n\n1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:04.600\n But there's so many things that you,\n\n1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:06.260\n and you keep going,\n\n1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:08.560\n the ability to think together.\n\n1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:10.320\n You can talk about like super brains.\n\n1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:12.760\n I mean, one of the examples Elon uses\n\n1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:16.040\n is that the low bandwidth of speech.\n\n1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:19.340\n If I go to a movie and I come out of a scary movie\n\n1:30:19.340 --> 1:30:20.180\n and you say, how was it?\n\n1:30:20.180 --> 1:30:21.160\n I said, oh, it was terrifying.\n\n1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:22.960\n Well, what did I just do?\n\n1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:24.520\n I just gave you,\n\n1:30:24.520 --> 1:30:26.440\n I had five buckets I could have given you.\n\n1:30:26.440 --> 1:30:29.480\n One was horrifying, terrifying, scary, eerie, creepy,\n\n1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:30.640\n whatever.\n\n1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:31.880\n That's about it.\n\n1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:36.240\n And I had a much more nuanced experience than that.\n\n1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:39.560\n And all I have is these words, right?\n\n1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:41.920\n And so instead I just hand you the bucket.\n\n1:30:41.920 --> 1:30:44.160\n I put the stuff in the bucket and give it to you,\n\n1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:45.440\n but all you have is the bucket.\n\n1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:47.720\n You just have to guess what I put into that bucket.\n\n1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:50.480\n All you can do is look at the label of the bucket and say,\n\n1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:52.860\n when I say terrifying, here's what I mean.\n\n1:30:52.860 --> 1:30:55.120\n So the point is it's very lossy.\n\n1:30:55.120 --> 1:30:57.300\n I had all this nuanced information\n\n1:30:57.300 --> 1:30:58.140\n of what I thought of the movie.\n\n1:30:58.140 --> 1:31:00.680\n And I'm sending you a very low res package\n\n1:31:00.680 --> 1:31:02.000\n that you're gonna now guess\n\n1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.060\n what the high res thing looked like.\n\n1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:05.680\n That's language in general.\n\n1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:07.140\n Our thoughts are much more nuanced.\n\n1:31:07.140 --> 1:31:08.760\n We can think to each other.\n\n1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:09.720\n We can do amazing things.\n\n1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:11.600\n We could A, have a brainstorm that doesn't feel like,\n\n1:31:11.600 --> 1:31:13.080\n oh, we're not talking in each other's heads.\n\n1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:14.480\n Not just that I hear your voice.\n\n1:31:14.480 --> 1:31:15.760\n No, no, no, we are just thinking.\n\n1:31:15.760 --> 1:31:18.900\n No words are being said internally or externally.\n\n1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:21.680\n The two brains are literally collaborating.\n\n1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:22.520\n It's something, it's a skill.\n\n1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:23.360\n I'm sure we'd have to get good at it.\n\n1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:25.080\n I'm sure young kids will be great at it\n\n1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:26.480\n and old people will be bad.\n\n1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:28.440\n But you think together and together you're like,\n\n1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:29.600\n oh, had the joint epiphany.\n\n1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:31.760\n And now how about eight people in a room doing it, right?\n\n1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:34.040\n So it gets, you know, there's other examples.\n\n1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:37.540\n How about when you're a dress designer or a bridge designer\n\n1:31:37.540 --> 1:31:40.760\n and you want to show people what your dress looks like.\n\n1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:42.480\n Well, right now you gotta sketch it for a long time.\n\n1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:44.320\n Here, just beam it onto the screen from your head.\n\n1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:45.160\n So you can picture it.\n\n1:31:45.160 --> 1:31:47.400\n If, you know, if you can picture a tree in your head,\n\n1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:48.840\n well, you can just suddenly,\n\n1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:50.080\n whatever's in your head, you can be pictured.\n\n1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:52.000\n So we'll have to get very good at it, right?\n\n1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:52.920\n And take a skill, right?\n\n1:31:52.920 --> 1:31:54.240\n You know, you're gonna have to,\n\n1:31:54.240 --> 1:31:56.240\n but the possibilities, my God.\n\n1:31:56.240 --> 1:31:58.960\n Talk about like, I feel like if that works,\n\n1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:01.440\n if we really do have that as something,\n\n1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:04.280\n I think it'll almost be like a new ADBC line.\n\n1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:07.280\n It's such a big change that the idea of like anyone living\n\n1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:09.320\n before everyone had brain machine interfaces\n\n1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:12.820\n is living in like before the common era.\n\n1:32:12.820 --> 1:32:16.080\n It's that level of like big change if it can work.\n\n1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:18.000\n Yeah, and like a replay of memories,\n\n1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:19.360\n just replaying stuff in your head.\n\n1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:20.640\n Oh my God, yeah.\n\n1:32:20.640 --> 1:32:23.040\n And copying, you know, you can hopefully copy memories\n\n1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:26.240\n onto other things and you don't have to just rely on your,\n\n1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:27.920\n you know, your wet circuitry.\n\n1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:29.640\n It does make me sad because you're right.\n\n1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:32.080\n The brain is incredibly neuroplastic\n\n1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:34.620\n and so it can adjust, it can learn how to do this.\n\n1:32:34.620 --> 1:32:36.080\n I think it'll be a skill.\n\n1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:38.440\n Or probably you and I will be too old to truly learn.\n\n1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:40.400\n Well, maybe we can get, there'll be great trainings.\n\n1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:42.040\n You know, I'm spending the next three months\n\n1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:44.880\n in like a, you know, one of the Neuralink trainings.\n\n1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:47.560\n But it'll still be a bit of like grandpa, I can't.\n\n1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:48.400\n Definitely.\n\n1:32:48.400 --> 1:32:49.220\n This is, you know, I was thinking,\n\n1:32:49.220 --> 1:32:50.060\n how am I gonna be old?\n\n1:32:50.060 --> 1:32:51.520\n I'm like, no, I'm gonna be great at the new phones.\n\n1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:53.020\n It's like, how can it be the phones?\n\n1:32:53.020 --> 1:32:54.360\n It's gonna be that, you know,\n\n1:32:54.360 --> 1:32:55.480\n the kid's gonna be thinking to me.\n\n1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:58.000\n I'm gonna be like, I just, can you just talk please?\n\n1:32:58.000 --> 1:32:59.480\n And they're gonna be like, okay, I'll just talk.\n\n1:32:59.480 --> 1:33:02.280\n And they're gonna, so that'll be the equivalent of,\n\n1:33:02.280 --> 1:33:04.400\n you know, yelling to your grandparents today.\n\n1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:06.840\n I really suspect, I don't know what your thoughts are,\n\n1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:11.080\n but I grew up in a time when physical contact interaction\n\n1:33:11.080 --> 1:33:12.120\n was valuable.\n\n1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:15.640\n I just feel like that's going to go the way\n\n1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:17.080\n that's gonna disappear.\n\n1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:17.920\n What, why?\n\n1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:19.120\n I mean, is there anything more intimate\n\n1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:20.200\n than thinking with each other?\n\n1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:21.480\n I mean, that's, you talk about, you know,\n\n1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:23.080\n once we were all doing that, it might feel like, man,\n\n1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:24.840\n everyone was so isolated from each other so far.\n\n1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:25.680\n Yeah, sorry.\n\n1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:27.560\n So I didn't say that intimacy disappears.\n\n1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:29.580\n I just meant physical, having to be in the same,\n\n1:33:29.580 --> 1:33:31.600\n having to touch each other.\n\n1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:34.840\n If people like that, if it is important,\n\n1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:36.960\n won't there be whole waves of people start to say,\n\n1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:38.200\n you know, there's all these articles that come out\n\n1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:39.860\n about how, you know, in our metaverse,\n\n1:33:39.860 --> 1:33:42.320\n we've lost something important and then now there's a huge,\n\n1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:43.600\n all first the hippies start doing it\n\n1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:44.940\n and then eventually it becomes this big wave\n\n1:33:44.940 --> 1:33:46.800\n and now everyone, won't, you know,\n\n1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:49.600\n if something truly is lost, won't we recover it?\n\n1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:51.640\n Well, I think from first principles,\n\n1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:54.680\n all of the components are there to engineer\n\n1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:59.680\n intimate experiences in the metaverse or in the cyberspace.\n\n1:34:00.140 --> 1:34:05.140\n And so to me, I don't see anything profoundly unique\n\n1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:08.160\n to the physical experience.\n\n1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:09.240\n Like I don't understand.\n\n1:34:09.240 --> 1:34:12.240\n But then why are you saying there's a loss there?\n\n1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:13.680\n No, I'm just sad because I won't,\n\n1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:16.240\n oh, it's a loss for me personally, because the world.\n\n1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:17.380\n So then you do think there's something unique\n\n1:34:17.380 --> 1:34:18.400\n in the physical experience.\n\n1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:20.320\n For me, because I was raised with it.\n\n1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:21.160\n Oh.\n\n1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:21.980\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:34:21.980 --> 1:34:24.240\n So whatever, so anything you're raised with,\n\n1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:25.080\n you fall in love with.\n\n1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:27.360\n Like people in this country came up with baseball.\n\n1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:29.240\n I was raised in the Soviet Union.\n\n1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:30.440\n I don't understand baseball.\n\n1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:32.740\n I get, I like it, but I don't love it\n\n1:34:32.740 --> 1:34:34.460\n the way Americans love it.\n\n1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.840\n Because a lot of times they went to baseball games\n\n1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:41.720\n with their father and then there's that family connection.\n\n1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:45.160\n There's a young kid dreaming about, I don't know,\n\n1:34:47.560 --> 1:34:49.880\n becoming an MLB player himself.\n\n1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:50.820\n I don't know, something like that.\n\n1:34:50.820 --> 1:34:52.760\n But that's what you're raised with,\n\n1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:53.800\n obviously is really important.\n\n1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:57.320\n But I mean, fundamentally to the human experience,\n\n1:34:57.320 --> 1:34:58.960\n listen, we're doing this podcast in person.\n\n1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:01.840\n So clearly I still value it, but.\n\n1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:02.680\n But it's true.\n\n1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:04.080\n If this were, obviously through a screen,\n\n1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:05.320\n we all agree that's not the same.\n\n1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:06.160\n Yeah, it's not the same.\n\n1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:08.280\n But if this were some, we had contact lenses on\n\n1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:11.840\n and maybe Neuralink, maybe again, forget,\n\n1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:13.800\n again, this is all the devices,\n\n1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:15.280\n even if it's just cool as a contact lens,\n\n1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:16.800\n that's all old school.\n\n1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:18.640\n Once you have the brain machine interface,\n\n1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:20.880\n it'll just be projection of,\n\n1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:22.340\n it'll take over my visual cortex.\n\n1:35:22.340 --> 1:35:25.200\n My visual cortex will get put into a virtual room\n\n1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:26.020\n and so will yours.\n\n1:35:26.020 --> 1:35:29.160\n So we will see, we will hear, really hear and see\n\n1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:32.400\n as if where you won't have any masks, no VR mask needed.\n\n1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:35.040\n And at that point, it really will feel like you'll forget.\n\n1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:37.440\n You'll say, will we together and physically or not?\n\n1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:38.280\n You won't even,\n\n1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:40.200\n it'd be so unimportant you won't even remember.\n\n1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:41.020\n And you're right.\n\n1:35:41.020 --> 1:35:45.040\n This is one of those shifts in society\n\n1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:46.720\n that changes everything.\n\n1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:50.120\n Romantically, people still need to be together.\n\n1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:52.640\n There's a whole set of like physical things\n\n1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:55.520\n with a relationship that are needed.\n\n1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:56.360\n You know, like.\n\n1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:57.180\n Like what?\n\n1:35:57.180 --> 1:35:58.020\n Like sex?\n\n1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:00.140\n Sex, but also just like there's pheromones.\n\n1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.160\n Like there's the physical touch is such a,\n\n1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:04.000\n that's like music.\n\n1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.440\n It goes to such a deeply primitive part of us\n\n1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:09.780\n that what physical touch with a romantic partner does,\n\n1:36:09.780 --> 1:36:11.160\n that I think that,\n\n1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:13.800\n so I'm sure there'll be a whole wave of people who,\n\n1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:14.880\n their new thing is that, you know,\n\n1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:16.180\n you're romantically involved people\n\n1:36:16.180 --> 1:36:17.440\n you never actually are in person with,\n\n1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:18.920\n but, and I'm sure there'll be things\n\n1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:20.360\n where you can actually smell what's in the room\n\n1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:21.200\n and you can.\n\n1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:22.040\n Yeah, and touch.\n\n1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:24.320\n Yeah, but I think that'll be one of the last things to go.\n\n1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:26.840\n I think there'll be, there's something,\n\n1:36:26.840 --> 1:36:29.840\n that to me seems like something that'll be a while\n\n1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:32.020\n before people feel like there's nothing lost\n\n1:36:32.020 --> 1:36:33.760\n by not being in the same.\n\n1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:35.840\n It's very difficult to replicate the human interaction.\n\n1:36:35.840 --> 1:36:37.200\n Although sex also, again,\n\n1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:39.740\n you could not to get too like weird,\n\n1:36:39.740 --> 1:36:41.320\n but you could have a thing where you,\n\n1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:44.520\n you're basically, you know, or, you know,\n\n1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:46.840\n let's just do a massage because it's less like awkward,\n\n1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:48.480\n but like someone, you know,\n\n1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:49.960\n everyone is still imagining sex.\n\n1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:50.800\n So go on.\n\n1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:54.720\n A masseuse could massage a fake body\n\n1:36:54.720 --> 1:36:57.000\n and you could feel whatever's happening, right?\n\n1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:58.960\n So you're lying down in your apartment alone,\n\n1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:00.200\n but you're feeling a full.\n\n1:37:00.200 --> 1:37:02.880\n There'll be the new like YouTube or like streaming\n\n1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:05.040\n where it's one masseuse massaging one body,\n\n1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:06.720\n but like a thousand people are experiencing.\n\n1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:07.540\n Exactly right now.\n\n1:37:07.540 --> 1:37:08.380\n Think about it right now.\n\n1:37:08.380 --> 1:37:10.680\n You know what, Taylor Swift doesn't play for one person\n\n1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:12.320\n and has to go around and every one of her fans\n\n1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:14.620\n she has to go play for or a book, right?\n\n1:37:14.620 --> 1:37:15.760\n You do it and it goes everywhere.\n\n1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:17.160\n So it'll be the same idea.\n\n1:37:18.220 --> 1:37:21.720\n You've written and thought a lot about AI.\n\n1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.040\n So AI safety specifically,\n\n1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:27.420\n you've mentioned you're actually starting a podcast,\n\n1:37:27.420 --> 1:37:28.360\n which is awesome.\n\n1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:30.540\n You're so good at talking, so good at thinking,\n\n1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:33.940\n so good at being weird in the most beautiful of ways,\n\n1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:38.580\n but you've been thinking about this AI safety question.\n\n1:37:38.580 --> 1:37:41.620\n Where today does your concern lie\n\n1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:43.840\n for the near future, for the longterm future?\n\n1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:46.540\n Like quite a bit of stuff happened,\n\n1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:48.600\n including with Elon's work with Tesla Autopilot.\n\n1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:52.100\n There's a bunch of amazing robots with Boston Dynamics\n\n1:37:52.100 --> 1:37:57.100\n and everyone's favorite vacuum robot, iRobot, Roomba.\n\n1:37:57.380 --> 1:37:59.300\n And then there's obviously the applications\n\n1:37:59.300 --> 1:38:01.840\n of machine learning for recommender systems\n\n1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:04.380\n in Twitter, Facebook, and so on.\n\n1:38:04.380 --> 1:38:07.780\n And face recognition for surveillance,\n\n1:38:07.780 --> 1:38:09.140\n all these kinds of things are happening.\n\n1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:12.580\n Just a lot of incredible use of not the face recognition,\n\n1:38:12.580 --> 1:38:15.300\n but the incredible use of deep learning,\n\n1:38:15.300 --> 1:38:19.340\n machine learning to capture information about people\n\n1:38:19.340 --> 1:38:24.180\n and try to recommend to them what they wanna consume next.\n\n1:38:24.180 --> 1:38:25.340\n Some of that can be abused,\n\n1:38:25.340 --> 1:38:27.100\n some of that can be used for good,\n\n1:38:27.100 --> 1:38:29.060\n like for Netflix or something like that.\n\n1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:30.300\n What are your thoughts about all this?\n\n1:38:30.300 --> 1:38:35.300\n Yeah, I mean, I really don't think humans are very smart,\n\n1:38:35.420 --> 1:38:38.700\n all things considered, I think we're like limited.\n\n1:38:38.700 --> 1:38:43.220\n And we're dumb enough that we're very easily manipulable.\n\n1:38:43.220 --> 1:38:45.980\n Not just like, oh, like our emotions,\n\n1:38:45.980 --> 1:38:50.260\n people can, our emotions can be pulled like puppet strings.\n\n1:38:50.260 --> 1:38:51.240\n I mean, again, I look at like,\n\n1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:53.460\n I do look at what's going on in political polarization now\n\n1:38:53.460 --> 1:38:56.500\n and I see a lot of puppet string emotions happening.\n\n1:38:56.500 --> 1:38:58.980\n So yeah, there's a lot to be scared of for sure,\n\n1:38:58.980 --> 1:39:00.660\n like very scared of.\n\n1:39:00.660 --> 1:39:03.700\n I get excited about a lot of very specific things.\n\n1:39:03.700 --> 1:39:06.420\n Like one of the things I get excited about is I like,\n\n1:39:06.420 --> 1:39:08.540\n so the future of wearables, right?\n\n1:39:08.540 --> 1:39:09.720\n Again, I think that it would be like,\n\n1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:11.700\n oh, the wrist, the Fitbit around my wrist\n\n1:39:11.700 --> 1:39:13.380\n is gonna seem, you know, the whoop\n\n1:39:13.380 --> 1:39:17.900\n is gonna seem really hilariously old school in 20 years.\n\n1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:18.740\n Back with Neuralink.\n\n1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:21.020\n Like a big bracelet, right?\n\n1:39:21.020 --> 1:39:24.140\n It's gonna turn into little sensors in our blood probably,\n\n1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:26.220\n or, you know, even, you know, infrared,\n\n1:39:26.220 --> 1:39:28.700\n we're, you know, just things that are gonna be,\n\n1:39:28.700 --> 1:39:31.060\n it's gonna be collecting a hundred times more data\n\n1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:32.580\n than it collects now, more nuanced data,\n\n1:39:32.580 --> 1:39:34.420\n more specific to our body.\n\n1:39:34.420 --> 1:39:36.660\n And it's going to be, you know, super reliable,\n\n1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:38.100\n but that's the hardware side.\n\n1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:40.460\n And then the software is gonna be,\n\n1:39:40.460 --> 1:39:41.660\n this is, I've not done my deep dive.\n\n1:39:41.660 --> 1:39:42.620\n This is all speculation,\n\n1:39:42.620 --> 1:39:45.060\n but the software is gonna get really good.\n\n1:39:45.060 --> 1:39:46.940\n And this is the AI component.\n\n1:39:46.940 --> 1:39:49.200\n And so I get excited about specific things like that.\n\n1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:54.200\n Like think about if hardware were able to collect,\n\n1:39:54.580 --> 1:39:56.680\n first of all, the hardware knows your whole genome\n\n1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:00.700\n and we know a lot more about what a genome sequence means.\n\n1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:03.420\n Cause you can collect your genome now\n\n1:40:03.420 --> 1:40:04.400\n and we just don't know much.\n\n1:40:04.400 --> 1:40:07.160\n We, okay, we don't have much to do with that information.\n\n1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:09.220\n As AI gets, so now you have your genome,\n\n1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:11.260\n you've got what's in your blood at any given moment,\n\n1:40:11.260 --> 1:40:13.260\n all the levels of everything, right?\n\n1:40:13.260 --> 1:40:16.140\n You have the exact width of your heart arteries\n\n1:40:16.140 --> 1:40:17.780\n at any given moment, you've got.\n\n1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:20.660\n All the, all the virons,\n\n1:40:20.660 --> 1:40:22.780\n all the viruses that ever visited your body\n\n1:40:22.780 --> 1:40:24.020\n cause there's a trace of it.\n\n1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:25.700\n So you have all the pathogens,\n\n1:40:25.700 --> 1:40:27.620\n all the things that like,\n\n1:40:27.620 --> 1:40:29.300\n you should be concerned about health wise\n\n1:40:29.300 --> 1:40:30.740\n and might have threatened you,\n\n1:40:30.740 --> 1:40:32.940\n you might be immune from all of that kind of stuff.\n\n1:40:32.940 --> 1:40:34.180\n They also, of course it knows\n\n1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:35.620\n how fast your heart is beating\n\n1:40:35.620 --> 1:40:37.140\n and it knows how much you know,\n\n1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:39.500\n exactly the amount of exercise,\n\n1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:41.160\n knows your muscle mass and your weight and all that,\n\n1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:42.960\n but it also maybe can even know your emotions.\n\n1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:44.820\n I mean, make, if emotions, you know, what are they,\n\n1:40:44.820 --> 1:40:45.660\n you know, where do they come from?\n\n1:40:45.660 --> 1:40:48.820\n Probably pretty obvious chemicals once we get in there.\n\n1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:50.660\n So again, Neuralink can be involved here maybe\n\n1:40:50.660 --> 1:40:53.140\n in collecting information, you know,\n\n1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:54.100\n cause right now you have to do the thing,\n\n1:40:54.100 --> 1:40:55.020\n what's your mood right now?\n\n1:40:55.020 --> 1:40:56.300\n And it's hard to even assess, you know,\n\n1:40:56.300 --> 1:40:58.860\n and you're in a bad mood, it's hard to even, but.\n\n1:40:58.860 --> 1:41:00.660\n By the way, just as a shout out,\n\n1:41:00.660 --> 1:41:03.780\n Lisa Feldman Barrett, who's a neuroscientist\n\n1:41:03.780 --> 1:41:05.500\n at Northeastern just wrote a,\n\n1:41:05.500 --> 1:41:07.060\n I mean, not just, like a few years ago,\n\n1:41:07.060 --> 1:41:09.700\n wrote a whole book saying our expression of emotions\n\n1:41:09.700 --> 1:41:12.260\n has nothing to do with the experience of emotions.\n\n1:41:12.260 --> 1:41:15.100\n So you really actually want to be measuring.\n\n1:41:15.100 --> 1:41:16.300\n That, that's exactly.\n\n1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:18.700\n I, you can tell because one of these apps pops up\n\n1:41:18.700 --> 1:41:20.660\n and says, you know, what, how do you feel right now?\n\n1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:21.500\n Good, bad?\n\n1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:22.320\n I'm like, I don't know.\n\n1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:24.700\n Like I feel bad right now because the thing popping up\n\n1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:26.660\n reminded me that I'm procrastinating.\n\n1:41:26.660 --> 1:41:27.900\n So I was on my phone, I should have been more,\n\n1:41:27.900 --> 1:41:29.320\n you know, I'm like, that's not my, you know.\n\n1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:33.400\n So I think it will probably be able to very,\n\n1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:34.660\n get all this info, right?\n\n1:41:34.660 --> 1:41:37.260\n Now the AI can go to town.\n\n1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:39.500\n Think about when the AI gets really good at this\n\n1:41:39.500 --> 1:41:42.460\n and it knows your genome and it knows it can just,\n\n1:41:42.460 --> 1:41:46.300\n I want the AI to just tell me what to do when it turns up.\n\n1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:47.820\n Okay, so how about this?\n\n1:41:47.820 --> 1:41:50.540\n Now imagine attaching that to a meal service, right?\n\n1:41:50.540 --> 1:41:51.700\n And the meal service has everything, you know,\n\n1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:54.620\n all the million ingredients and supplements and vitamins\n\n1:41:54.620 --> 1:41:55.860\n and everything.\n\n1:41:55.860 --> 1:41:59.420\n And I give the, I tell the AI my broad goals.\n\n1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:02.500\n I want to gain muscle or I want to, you know,\n\n1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:04.220\n maintain my weight, but I want to have more energy\n\n1:42:04.220 --> 1:42:05.540\n or whatever, I just want, or I want to, you know,\n\n1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:06.660\n I just want to be very healthy and I want to,\n\n1:42:06.660 --> 1:42:09.420\n obviously everyone wants the same, like 10 basic things.\n\n1:42:09.420 --> 1:42:11.300\n Like you want to avoid cancer, you want to, you know,\n\n1:42:11.300 --> 1:42:13.300\n various things, you want to age slower.\n\n1:42:14.300 --> 1:42:19.300\n So now the AI has my goals and a drone comes at,\n\n1:42:19.620 --> 1:42:22.340\n you know, a little thing pops up and it says like,\n\n1:42:22.340 --> 1:42:24.660\n you know, beep, beep, like, you know, 15 minutes,\n\n1:42:24.660 --> 1:42:25.980\n you're going to eat because it knows that's a great,\n\n1:42:25.980 --> 1:42:27.860\n that's the right time for my body to eat.\n\n1:42:27.860 --> 1:42:30.180\n 15 minutes later, a little slot opens in my wall\n\n1:42:30.180 --> 1:42:32.140\n where a drone has come from the factory,\n\n1:42:32.140 --> 1:42:35.140\n the eating, the food factory and dropped the perfect meal\n\n1:42:35.140 --> 1:42:38.820\n for my, that moment for me, for my mood, for my genome,\n\n1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:40.700\n for my blood contents.\n\n1:42:40.700 --> 1:42:42.740\n And it's, it's because it knows my goals.\n\n1:42:42.740 --> 1:42:44.620\n So, you know, it knows I want to feel energy at this time\n\n1:42:44.620 --> 1:42:45.740\n and then I want to wind down here.\n\n1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:47.380\n So those things you have to tell it.\n\n1:42:47.380 --> 1:42:50.340\n Well, plus the pleasure thing, like it knows what kind\n\n1:42:50.340 --> 1:42:52.500\n of components of a meal you've enjoyed in the past\n\n1:42:52.500 --> 1:42:53.940\n so you can assemble the perfect meal.\n\n1:42:53.940 --> 1:42:56.940\n Exactly, it knows you way better than you know yourself,\n\n1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:58.340\n better than any human could ever know you.\n\n1:42:58.340 --> 1:42:59.940\n And a little thing pops up,\n\n1:42:59.940 --> 1:43:01.460\n you still have some choice, right?\n\n1:43:01.460 --> 1:43:05.220\n Still, it pops up and it says like, you know, coffee,\n\n1:43:05.220 --> 1:43:07.300\n because it knows that, you know, my cutoff,\n\n1:43:07.300 --> 1:43:08.940\n they says, you know, I can have coffee\n\n1:43:08.940 --> 1:43:11.540\n for the next 15 minutes only because at that point\n\n1:43:11.540 --> 1:43:12.940\n it knows how long it stays in my system.\n\n1:43:12.940 --> 1:43:14.740\n It knows what my sleep is like when I have it too late.\n\n1:43:14.740 --> 1:43:16.220\n It knows I have to wake up at this time tomorrow\n\n1:43:16.220 --> 1:43:17.780\n because that was my calendar.\n\n1:43:17.780 --> 1:43:19.660\n And so I think a lot of people's, this is,\n\n1:43:19.660 --> 1:43:22.100\n I think something that humans are wrong about\n\n1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:23.660\n is that most people will hear this and be like,\n\n1:43:23.660 --> 1:43:26.060\n that sounds awful, that sounds dystopian.\n\n1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:27.460\n No, it doesn't, it sounds incredible.\n\n1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:29.660\n And if we all had this, we would not look back and be like,\n\n1:43:29.660 --> 1:43:32.140\n I wish I was like making awful choices every day\n\n1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:33.660\n like I was in the past.\n\n1:43:33.660 --> 1:43:36.180\n And then this isn't, these aren't important decisions.\n\n1:43:36.180 --> 1:43:38.860\n Your important decision making energy,\n\n1:43:38.860 --> 1:43:41.700\n your important focus and your attention can go\n\n1:43:41.700 --> 1:43:44.620\n onto your kids and on your work and on, you know,\n\n1:43:44.620 --> 1:43:46.420\n helping other people and things that matter.\n\n1:43:46.420 --> 1:43:49.940\n And so I think AI, when I think about like personal\n\n1:43:49.940 --> 1:43:53.780\n lifestyle and stuff like that, I really love,\n\n1:43:53.780 --> 1:43:55.420\n like I love thinking about that.\n\n1:43:55.420 --> 1:43:57.020\n I think it's gonna be very, and I think we'll all be\n\n1:43:57.020 --> 1:44:00.460\n so much healthier that when we look back today,\n\n1:44:00.460 --> 1:44:02.060\n one of the things that's gonna look so primitive\n\n1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:03.500\n is the one size fits all thing,\n\n1:44:03.500 --> 1:44:05.460\n getting like reading advice about keto.\n\n1:44:07.820 --> 1:44:10.020\n Each genome is gonna have very specific,\n\n1:44:10.020 --> 1:44:12.780\n one, you know, unique advice coming from AI.\n\n1:44:12.780 --> 1:44:14.180\n And so, yeah.\n\n1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:16.700\n Yeah, the customization that's enabled by collection\n\n1:44:16.700 --> 1:44:19.700\n of data and the use of AI, a lot of people think\n\n1:44:19.700 --> 1:44:22.340\n what's the, like they think of the worst case scenario\n\n1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:25.180\n that data being used by authoritarian governments\n\n1:44:25.180 --> 1:44:26.580\n to control you, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:28.420\n They don't think about most likely,\n\n1:44:28.420 --> 1:44:30.020\n especially in a capitalist society,\n\n1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:34.300\n it's most likely going to be used as part of a competition\n\n1:44:34.300 --> 1:44:36.780\n to get you the most delicious and healthy meal possible\n\n1:44:36.780 --> 1:44:38.340\n as fast as possible.\n\n1:44:38.340 --> 1:44:40.700\n Yeah, so the world will definitely be much better\n\n1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:42.260\n with the integration of data.\n\n1:44:42.260 --> 1:44:46.420\n But of course, you wanna be able to be transparent\n\n1:44:46.420 --> 1:44:48.340\n and honest about how that data is misused.\n\n1:44:48.340 --> 1:44:50.380\n And that's why it's important to have free speech\n\n1:44:50.380 --> 1:44:52.500\n and people to speak out, like when some bullshit\n\n1:44:52.500 --> 1:44:53.580\n is being done by companies.\n\n1:44:53.580 --> 1:44:55.940\n That we need to have our wits about us as a society.\n\n1:44:55.940 --> 1:45:00.460\n Like this is free speech is the mechanism\n\n1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:03.460\n by which the big brain can think, can think for itself,\n\n1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:05.940\n can think straight, can see straight.\n\n1:45:05.940 --> 1:45:08.340\n When you take away free speech, when you start saying\n\n1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:10.940\n that in every topic, when any topic's political,\n\n1:45:10.940 --> 1:45:12.820\n it becomes treacherous to talk about.\n\n1:45:12.820 --> 1:45:15.660\n So forget the government taking away free speech.\n\n1:45:15.660 --> 1:45:18.860\n If the culture penalizes nuanced conversation\n\n1:45:18.860 --> 1:45:21.060\n about any topic that's political\n\n1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:24.380\n and the politics is so all consuming\n\n1:45:24.380 --> 1:45:29.380\n and it's such a incredible market to polarize people,\n\n1:45:30.100 --> 1:45:32.860\n for media to polarize people and to bring any topic it can\n\n1:45:32.860 --> 1:45:36.700\n into that and get people hooked on it as a political topic,\n\n1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:38.100\n we become a very dumb society.\n\n1:45:38.100 --> 1:45:39.860\n So free speech goes away as far as it matters.\n\n1:45:39.860 --> 1:45:42.060\n People say, oh, people like to say outside,\n\n1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:43.220\n you don't even know what free speech is.\n\n1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:46.860\n Free speech is, your free speech is not being violated.\n\n1:45:46.860 --> 1:45:48.380\n It's like, no, you're right.\n\n1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:50.780\n My first amendment rights are not being violated.\n\n1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:52.060\n But the culture of free speech,\n\n1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:53.860\n which is the second ingredient of two,\n\n1:45:53.860 --> 1:45:55.540\n you need the first amendment\n\n1:45:55.540 --> 1:45:57.260\n and you need the culture of free speech.\n\n1:45:57.260 --> 1:45:58.180\n And now you have free speech\n\n1:45:58.180 --> 1:46:00.940\n and the culture is much more specific.\n\n1:46:00.940 --> 1:46:03.180\n You obviously can have a culture that believes people\n\n1:46:03.180 --> 1:46:06.340\n right now take any topic again, that has to do with like,\n\n1:46:06.340 --> 1:46:10.020\n some very sensitive topics, police shootings,\n\n1:46:10.940 --> 1:46:13.660\n or what's going on in K through 12 schools\n\n1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:16.820\n or even climate change, take any of these.\n\n1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:19.900\n And the first amendment's still there.\n\n1:46:19.900 --> 1:46:22.700\n You're not gonna get arrested no matter what you say.\n\n1:46:22.700 --> 1:46:25.620\n The culture of free speech is gone\n\n1:46:25.620 --> 1:46:27.060\n because you will be destroyed.\n\n1:46:27.060 --> 1:46:29.420\n Your life can be over as far as it matters\n\n1:46:30.820 --> 1:46:31.700\n if you say the wrong thing.\n\n1:46:31.700 --> 1:46:35.260\n But a really vigorous culture of free speech,\n\n1:46:35.260 --> 1:46:36.540\n you get no penalty at all\n\n1:46:36.540 --> 1:46:38.380\n for even saying something super dumb.\n\n1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:40.380\n People will say, like, people will laugh and be like,\n\n1:46:40.380 --> 1:46:42.660\n well, that was like kind of hilariously offensive\n\n1:46:42.660 --> 1:46:43.940\n and like, not at all correct.\n\n1:46:43.940 --> 1:46:45.460\n Like, you know, you're wrong and here's why.\n\n1:46:45.460 --> 1:46:47.100\n But no one's like mad at you.\n\n1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:49.660\n Now the brain is thinking at its best.\n\n1:46:49.660 --> 1:46:51.020\n The IQ of the big brain is like,\n\n1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:53.140\n as high as it can be in that culture.\n\n1:46:53.140 --> 1:46:55.060\n And the culture where, and you say something wrong\n\n1:46:55.060 --> 1:46:56.540\n and people say, oh, wow, you've changed.\n\n1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:58.780\n Oh, wow, like, look, this is his real colors.\n\n1:46:58.780 --> 1:47:01.580\n He knows the big brain is dumb.\n\n1:47:01.580 --> 1:47:03.860\n You still have mutual respect for each other.\n\n1:47:03.860 --> 1:47:06.980\n So like, you don't think lesser of others\n\n1:47:06.980 --> 1:47:08.540\n when they say a bunch of dumb things.\n\n1:47:08.540 --> 1:47:10.860\n You know it's just the play of ideas.\n\n1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:12.860\n But you still have respect, you still have love for them.\n\n1:47:12.860 --> 1:47:15.300\n Because I think the worst case is\n\n1:47:15.300 --> 1:47:18.780\n when you have a complete free like anarchy of ideas\n\n1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:22.180\n where it's like everybody lost hope\n\n1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:25.740\n that something like a truth can even be converged towards.\n\n1:47:25.740 --> 1:47:27.540\n Like, everybody has their own truth.\n\n1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:29.580\n Then it's just chaos.\n\n1:47:29.580 --> 1:47:31.500\n Like, if you have mutual respect\n\n1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:33.780\n and a mutual goal of arriving at the truth\n\n1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:35.820\n and the humility that you want to listen\n\n1:47:35.820 --> 1:47:37.180\n to other people's ideas,\n\n1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:38.940\n and a forgiveness that other people's ideas\n\n1:47:38.940 --> 1:47:39.860\n might be dumb as hell,\n\n1:47:39.860 --> 1:47:41.340\n that doesn't mean they're lesser beings,\n\n1:47:41.340 --> 1:47:42.420\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:47:42.420 --> 1:47:44.540\n But that's like a weird balance to strike.\n\n1:47:44.540 --> 1:47:47.540\n Right now people are being trained, little kids,\n\n1:47:47.540 --> 1:47:49.300\n college students, being trained\n\n1:47:49.300 --> 1:47:51.340\n to think the exact opposite way.\n\n1:47:51.340 --> 1:47:53.260\n To think that there's no such thing as objective truth,\n\n1:47:53.260 --> 1:47:54.620\n which is, you know, the objective truth\n\n1:47:54.620 --> 1:47:59.180\n is the end on the compass for every thinker.\n\n1:47:59.180 --> 1:48:02.140\n Doesn't mean we're necessarily on our way or we're finding,\n\n1:48:02.140 --> 1:48:03.580\n but we're all aiming in the same direction.\n\n1:48:03.580 --> 1:48:05.020\n We all believe that there's a place\n\n1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:06.700\n we can eventually get closer to.\n\n1:48:07.660 --> 1:48:08.980\n Not objective truth, you know,\n\n1:48:08.980 --> 1:48:12.140\n teaching them that disagreement is bad, violence.\n\n1:48:12.140 --> 1:48:14.500\n You know, it's, you know,\n\n1:48:16.220 --> 1:48:17.980\n it's like, you know, you quickly sound like\n\n1:48:17.980 --> 1:48:20.380\n you're just going on like a political rant with this topic,\n\n1:48:20.380 --> 1:48:22.420\n but like, it's really bad.\n\n1:48:22.420 --> 1:48:24.780\n It's like genuinely the worst.\n\n1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:26.860\n If I had my own country,\n\n1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:30.460\n I mean, it's like I would teach kids\n\n1:48:30.460 --> 1:48:31.780\n some very specific things\n\n1:48:31.780 --> 1:48:34.220\n that this is doing the exact opposite of,\n\n1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:38.380\n and it sucks, it sucks.\n\n1:48:39.380 --> 1:48:40.700\n Speaking of a way to escape this,\n\n1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:43.460\n you've tweeted 30 minutes of reading a day equals,\n\n1:48:43.460 --> 1:48:44.300\n yeah, this whole video,\n\n1:48:44.300 --> 1:48:46.020\n and it's cool to think about reading,\n\n1:48:46.020 --> 1:48:50.260\n like as a habit and something that accumulates.\n\n1:48:50.260 --> 1:48:51.860\n You said 30 minutes of reading a day\n\n1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:54.300\n equals 1000 books in 50 years.\n\n1:48:54.300 --> 1:48:56.940\n I love like thinking about this,\n\n1:48:56.940 --> 1:48:59.340\n like chipping away at the mountain.\n\n1:48:59.340 --> 1:49:02.900\n Can you expand on that sort of the habit of reading?\n\n1:49:02.900 --> 1:49:04.620\n How do you recommend people read?\n\n1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:06.940\n Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's incredible.\n\n1:49:06.940 --> 1:49:10.580\n If you do something, a little of something every day,\n\n1:49:10.580 --> 1:49:12.780\n it compiles, it compiles.\n\n1:49:12.780 --> 1:49:14.300\n You know, I always think about like the people\n\n1:49:14.300 --> 1:49:16.700\n who achieve these incredible things in life,\n\n1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:19.580\n these great, like famous, legendary people,\n\n1:49:19.580 --> 1:49:21.300\n they have the same number of days that you do,\n\n1:49:21.300 --> 1:49:23.660\n and it's not like they were doing magical days.\n\n1:49:23.660 --> 1:49:26.620\n They just, they got a little done every day,\n\n1:49:26.620 --> 1:49:31.620\n and that adds up to a monument,\n\n1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:33.940\n they're putting one brick in a day,\n\n1:49:33.940 --> 1:49:35.020\n eventually they have this building,\n\n1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:36.300\n this legendary building.\n\n1:49:36.300 --> 1:49:38.140\n So you can take writing,\n\n1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:40.660\n someone who, you know, there's two aspiring writers,\n\n1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:42.100\n and one doesn't ever write,\n\n1:49:42.100 --> 1:49:44.420\n doesn't, you know, manages to never zero write,\n\n1:49:44.420 --> 1:49:45.260\n zero pages a day,\n\n1:49:45.260 --> 1:49:49.340\n and the other one manages to do two pages a week, right?\n\n1:49:49.340 --> 1:49:50.180\n Not very much.\n\n1:49:50.180 --> 1:49:51.140\n The other one does zero pages a week,\n\n1:49:51.140 --> 1:49:55.420\n two pages a week, 98% of both of their time is the same.\n\n1:49:55.420 --> 1:49:58.580\n The other person, just 2%, they're doing one other thing.\n\n1:49:58.580 --> 1:50:00.700\n One year later, they have written,\n\n1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:01.740\n they write two books a year.\n\n1:50:01.740 --> 1:50:04.420\n This prolific person, you know, in 20 years,\n\n1:50:04.420 --> 1:50:05.500\n they've written 40 books,\n\n1:50:05.500 --> 1:50:07.500\n they're one of the most prolific writers of all time.\n\n1:50:07.500 --> 1:50:08.900\n They write two pages a week.\n\n1:50:09.820 --> 1:50:10.980\n Sorry, that's not true.\n\n1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:12.340\n That was two pages a day.\n\n1:50:12.340 --> 1:50:13.420\n Okay, two pages a week,\n\n1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:15.860\n you're still writing about a book every two years.\n\n1:50:15.860 --> 1:50:17.940\n So in 20 years, you've still written 10 books,\n\n1:50:17.940 --> 1:50:19.740\n also prolific writer, right?\n\n1:50:19.740 --> 1:50:21.380\n Huge, massive writing career.\n\n1:50:21.380 --> 1:50:23.380\n You write two pages every Sunday morning.\n\n1:50:23.380 --> 1:50:25.220\n The other person has the same exact week,\n\n1:50:25.220 --> 1:50:26.460\n and they don't do that Sunday morning thing.\n\n1:50:26.460 --> 1:50:27.900\n They are a wannabe writer.\n\n1:50:27.900 --> 1:50:29.100\n They always said they could write.\n\n1:50:29.100 --> 1:50:30.860\n They talk about how they used to be,\n\n1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:31.900\n and nothing happens, right?\n\n1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:34.220\n So it's inspiring, I think,\n\n1:50:34.220 --> 1:50:35.660\n for a lot of people who feel frustrated\n\n1:50:35.660 --> 1:50:36.500\n and they're not doing anything.\n\n1:50:36.500 --> 1:50:38.500\n So reading is another example\n\n1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:43.500\n where someone who reads very, you know, doesn't read,\n\n1:50:43.620 --> 1:50:45.620\n and someone who's a prolific reader,\n\n1:50:45.620 --> 1:50:47.500\n you know, I always think about like the Tyler Cowen types.\n\n1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:49.940\n I'm like, how the hell do you read so much?\n\n1:50:49.940 --> 1:50:51.300\n It's infuriating, you know?\n\n1:50:51.300 --> 1:50:53.780\n Or like James Clear puts out his like,\n\n1:50:53.780 --> 1:50:56.460\n his 10 favorite books of the year,\n\n1:50:56.460 --> 1:50:57.820\n his 20 favorite books of the year.\n\n1:50:57.820 --> 1:51:00.660\n I'm like, your 20 favorites?\n\n1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:02.180\n Like I'm trying to just read 20 books,\n\n1:51:02.180 --> 1:51:03.540\n like that would be an amazing year.\n\n1:51:03.540 --> 1:51:06.020\n So, but the thing is,\n\n1:51:06.020 --> 1:51:07.940\n they're not doing something crazy and magical.\n\n1:51:07.940 --> 1:51:09.940\n They're just reading a half hour a night, you know?\n\n1:51:09.940 --> 1:51:11.580\n If you read a half hour a night,\n\n1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:12.980\n the calculation I came to is that\n\n1:51:12.980 --> 1:51:15.220\n you can read a thousand books in 50 years.\n\n1:51:15.220 --> 1:51:18.580\n So as someone who's 80 and they've read a thousand books,\n\n1:51:18.580 --> 1:51:20.020\n you know, between 30 and 80,\n\n1:51:20.020 --> 1:51:21.780\n they are extremely well read.\n\n1:51:21.780 --> 1:51:24.820\n They can delve deep into many nonfiction areas.\n\n1:51:24.820 --> 1:51:27.820\n They can be, you know, an amazing fiction reader,\n\n1:51:27.820 --> 1:51:29.380\n avid fiction reader.\n\n1:51:29.380 --> 1:51:30.580\n And again, that's a half hour a day.\n\n1:51:30.580 --> 1:51:31.540\n Some people can do an hour,\n\n1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:33.060\n a half hour in the morning audio book,\n\n1:51:33.060 --> 1:51:34.140\n half hour at night in bed.\n\n1:51:34.140 --> 1:51:35.140\n Now they've read 2000 books.\n\n1:51:35.140 --> 1:51:40.140\n So I think it's motivating.\n\n1:51:40.860 --> 1:51:43.820\n And you realize that a lot of times you think\n\n1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:45.820\n that the people who are doing amazing things\n\n1:51:45.820 --> 1:51:48.860\n and you're not, you think that there's a bigger gap\n\n1:51:48.860 --> 1:51:51.420\n between you and them than there really is.\n\n1:51:51.420 --> 1:51:53.980\n I, on the reading front, I'm a very slow reader,\n\n1:51:53.980 --> 1:51:57.500\n which is just a very frustrating fact about me,\n\n1:51:58.380 --> 1:52:00.660\n but I'm faster with audio books.\n\n1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:02.460\n And also I just, you know, I'll just,\n\n1:52:02.460 --> 1:52:04.300\n it's just hard to get myself to read,\n\n1:52:04.300 --> 1:52:05.660\n but I've started doing audio books\n\n1:52:05.660 --> 1:52:09.060\n and I'll wake up, throw it on, do it in the shower,\n\n1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:10.980\n brushing my teeth, you know, making breakfast,\n\n1:52:10.980 --> 1:52:12.820\n dealing with the dogs, things like that, whatever,\n\n1:52:12.820 --> 1:52:14.140\n until I sit down.\n\n1:52:14.140 --> 1:52:17.820\n And that's, I can read, I can read a book a week,\n\n1:52:17.820 --> 1:52:20.420\n a book every 10 days at that clip.\n\n1:52:20.420 --> 1:52:21.820\n And suddenly I'm this big reader\n\n1:52:21.820 --> 1:52:24.180\n because I'm just, while doing my morning stuff,\n\n1:52:24.180 --> 1:52:25.340\n I have it on and also it's this fun,\n\n1:52:25.340 --> 1:52:26.260\n it makes the morning so fun.\n\n1:52:26.260 --> 1:52:27.860\n I'm like having a great time the whole morning.\n\n1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:29.500\n So I'm like, oh, I'm so into this book.\n\n1:52:29.500 --> 1:52:31.300\n So I think that, you know, audio books\n\n1:52:31.300 --> 1:52:32.940\n is another amazing gift to people\n\n1:52:32.940 --> 1:52:34.180\n who have a hard time reading.\n\n1:52:34.180 --> 1:52:36.260\n I find that that's actually an interesting skill.\n\n1:52:36.260 --> 1:52:38.700\n I do audio books quite a bit.\n\n1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:41.740\n Like it's a skill to maintain, at least for me,\n\n1:52:41.740 --> 1:52:43.180\n probably the kind of books I read,\n\n1:52:43.180 --> 1:52:45.620\n which is often like history or like,\n\n1:52:45.620 --> 1:52:47.060\n there's a lot of content.\n\n1:52:47.060 --> 1:52:51.900\n And if you miss parts of it, you miss out on stuff.\n\n1:52:51.900 --> 1:52:55.300\n And so it's a skill to maintain focus.\n\n1:52:55.300 --> 1:52:56.140\n At least for me.\n\n1:52:56.140 --> 1:52:58.820\n Well, the 10 second back button is very valuable.\n\n1:52:58.820 --> 1:52:59.660\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:52:59.660 --> 1:53:01.140\n So I just, if I get lost,\n\n1:53:01.140 --> 1:53:02.460\n sometimes the book is so good\n\n1:53:02.460 --> 1:53:03.980\n that I'm thinking about what the person just said.\n\n1:53:03.980 --> 1:53:06.540\n And I just get, the skill for me is just remembering to pause.\n\n1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:09.020\n And if I don't, no problem, just back, back, back, back.\n\n1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:10.460\n Just three quick backs.\n\n1:53:10.460 --> 1:53:12.140\n So of course it's not that efficient,\n\n1:53:12.140 --> 1:53:14.020\n but it's, I do the same thing when I'm reading.\n\n1:53:14.020 --> 1:53:14.860\n I'll read a whole paragraph\n\n1:53:14.860 --> 1:53:15.900\n and realize I was tuning out.\n\n1:53:15.900 --> 1:53:17.100\n Yeah, you know?\n\n1:53:17.100 --> 1:53:19.780\n You know, I haven't actually even considered to try that.\n\n1:53:19.780 --> 1:53:22.900\n I've been so hard on myself maintaining focus\n\n1:53:22.900 --> 1:53:24.300\n because you do get lost in thought.\n\n1:53:24.300 --> 1:53:25.140\n Maybe I should try that.\n\n1:53:25.140 --> 1:53:26.820\n Yeah, and when you get lost in thought, by the way,\n\n1:53:26.820 --> 1:53:27.900\n you're processing the book.\n\n1:53:27.900 --> 1:53:29.220\n That's not wasted time.\n\n1:53:29.220 --> 1:53:31.300\n That's your brain really categorizing\n\n1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:33.460\n and cataloging what you just read and like.\n\n1:53:33.460 --> 1:53:36.060\n Well, there's several kinds of thoughts, right?\n\n1:53:36.060 --> 1:53:37.540\n There's thoughts related to the book\n\n1:53:37.540 --> 1:53:40.060\n and there's a thought that it could take you elsewhere.\n\n1:53:40.060 --> 1:53:43.860\n Well, I find that if I am continually thinking\n\n1:53:43.860 --> 1:53:45.820\n about something else, I just say, I'm not,\n\n1:53:45.820 --> 1:53:47.740\n I just pause the book.\n\n1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:49.220\n Yeah, especially in the shower or something\n\n1:53:49.220 --> 1:53:51.180\n when like, that's sometimes\n\n1:53:51.180 --> 1:53:52.140\n when really great thoughts come up.\n\n1:53:52.140 --> 1:53:53.860\n If I'm having all these thoughts about other stuff,\n\n1:53:53.860 --> 1:53:55.860\n I'm saying clearly my mind wants to work on something else.\n\n1:53:55.860 --> 1:53:56.700\n So I'll just pause it.\n\n1:53:56.700 --> 1:53:57.780\n Yeah, quiet, Dan Carlin.\n\n1:53:57.780 --> 1:53:59.220\n I'm thinking about something else right now.\n\n1:53:59.220 --> 1:54:00.620\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:54:00.620 --> 1:54:04.220\n Also you can, things like you have to head out to the store.\n\n1:54:04.220 --> 1:54:06.460\n Like I'm gonna read 20 pages on that trip.\n\n1:54:06.460 --> 1:54:08.540\n Just walking back and forth, going to the airport.\n\n1:54:08.540 --> 1:54:10.460\n I mean, flights, you know, the Uber,\n\n1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:12.060\n and then you're walking to the,\n\n1:54:12.060 --> 1:54:13.100\n walking through the airport,\n\n1:54:13.100 --> 1:54:13.980\n you're sharing the security line.\n\n1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:15.900\n I'm reading the whole time, like,\n\n1:54:15.900 --> 1:54:17.380\n I know this is not groundbreaking.\n\n1:54:17.380 --> 1:54:18.500\n People know what audio books are,\n\n1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:19.980\n but I think that more people\n\n1:54:19.980 --> 1:54:21.380\n should probably get into them than do.\n\n1:54:21.380 --> 1:54:22.220\n Cause I know a lot of people,\n\n1:54:22.220 --> 1:54:23.540\n they have this stubborn kind of things.\n\n1:54:23.540 --> 1:54:25.740\n I don't like, I like to have the paper book and sure,\n\n1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:27.940\n but like, it's pretty fun to be able to read.\n\n1:54:27.940 --> 1:54:31.060\n I still, I listen to a huge number of audio books\n\n1:54:31.060 --> 1:54:32.940\n and podcasts, but I still,\n\n1:54:32.940 --> 1:54:36.540\n the most impactful experiences for me are still reading.\n\n1:54:36.540 --> 1:54:38.340\n And I read very, very slow.\n\n1:54:38.340 --> 1:54:41.060\n And it's very frustrating when like,\n\n1:54:41.060 --> 1:54:43.460\n you go to these websites like that estimate\n\n1:54:43.460 --> 1:54:45.620\n how long a book takes on average,\n\n1:54:45.620 --> 1:54:46.540\n that those are always annoying.\n\n1:54:46.540 --> 1:54:50.100\n They do like a page a minute when I read like best,\n\n1:54:50.100 --> 1:54:51.940\n a page every two minutes, at best.\n\n1:54:51.940 --> 1:54:54.500\n At best, when you're like really like,\n\n1:54:54.500 --> 1:54:55.820\n actually not pausing.\n\n1:54:55.820 --> 1:54:58.060\n I just, my ADD, it's like, I just,\n\n1:54:58.060 --> 1:54:59.860\n it's hard to keep focusing.\n\n1:54:59.860 --> 1:55:01.820\n And I also like to really absorb.\n\n1:55:01.820 --> 1:55:03.460\n So on the other side of things,\n\n1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:05.940\n when I finish a book, 10 years later, I'll be like,\n\n1:55:05.940 --> 1:55:06.980\n you know that scene when this happens\n\n1:55:06.980 --> 1:55:07.820\n and another friend read it,\n\n1:55:07.820 --> 1:55:08.660\n I'll be like, what?\n\n1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:09.500\n I don't remember any like details.\n\n1:55:09.500 --> 1:55:10.860\n I'm like, oh, I can tell you like the entire.\n\n1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:12.380\n So I absorbed the shit out of it,\n\n1:55:12.380 --> 1:55:14.820\n but I don't think it's worth it to like have to read\n\n1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:16.580\n so less, so much less in my life.\n\n1:55:16.580 --> 1:55:18.740\n I actually, so in terms of going to the airport,\n\n1:55:18.740 --> 1:55:22.260\n you know, in these like filler moments of life,\n\n1:55:22.260 --> 1:55:24.860\n I do a lot of, it's an app called Anki.\n\n1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:26.620\n I don't know if you know about it.\n\n1:55:26.620 --> 1:55:29.180\n It's a space repetition app.\n\n1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:31.580\n So there's all of these facts I have when I read,\n\n1:55:31.580 --> 1:55:33.940\n I write it down if I want to remember it.\n\n1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:36.940\n And it's these, you review it.\n\n1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:39.180\n And the one, the things you remember,\n\n1:55:39.180 --> 1:55:41.380\n it takes longer and longer to bring back up.\n\n1:55:41.380 --> 1:55:43.660\n It's like flashcards, but a digital app.\n\n1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:44.500\n It's called Anki.\n\n1:55:44.500 --> 1:55:45.340\n I recommend it to a lot of people.\n\n1:55:45.340 --> 1:55:46.780\n There's a huge community of people\n\n1:55:46.780 --> 1:55:48.100\n that are just like obsessed with it.\n\n1:55:48.100 --> 1:55:49.740\n Anki?\n\n1:55:49.740 --> 1:55:51.660\n A N K I.\n\n1:55:51.660 --> 1:55:55.620\n So this is extremely well known app and idea,\n\n1:55:55.620 --> 1:55:59.460\n like among students who are like medical students,\n\n1:55:59.460 --> 1:56:01.820\n like people that really have to study.\n\n1:56:01.820 --> 1:56:03.740\n Like this is not like fun stuff.\n\n1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:06.300\n They really have to memorize a lot of things.\n\n1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:07.380\n They have to remember them well.\n\n1:56:07.380 --> 1:56:08.540\n They have to be able to integrate them\n\n1:56:08.540 --> 1:56:10.180\n with a bunch of ideas.\n\n1:56:10.180 --> 1:56:13.460\n And I find it to be really useful for like,\n\n1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:14.820\n when you read history,\n\n1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:17.820\n if you think this particular factoid,\n\n1:56:17.820 --> 1:56:19.780\n they'd probably be extremely useful for you.\n\n1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:23.460\n Cause you're, that'd be interesting actually thought.\n\n1:56:23.460 --> 1:56:25.540\n Cause you're doing, you talked about like opening up\n\n1:56:25.540 --> 1:56:27.700\n a trillion tabs and reading things.\n\n1:56:29.260 --> 1:56:32.260\n You know, you probably want to remember some facts\n\n1:56:32.260 --> 1:56:33.540\n you read along the way.\n\n1:56:33.540 --> 1:56:34.940\n Like you might remember, okay,\n\n1:56:34.940 --> 1:56:37.060\n this thing I can't directly put into the writing,\n\n1:56:37.060 --> 1:56:38.860\n but it's a cool little factoid.\n\n1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:39.700\n I want to.\n\n1:56:39.700 --> 1:56:40.540\n Oh, all the time.\n\n1:56:40.540 --> 1:56:41.460\n Store that in there.\n\n1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:43.900\n And that's why I go Anki, drop it in.\n\n1:56:43.900 --> 1:56:45.020\n Oh, you can just drop it in.\n\n1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:45.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:48.620\n You drop it in a line of a podcast or like a video?\n\n1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:49.620\n Well, no.\n\n1:56:49.620 --> 1:56:50.580\n I guess I can type it though.\n\n1:56:50.580 --> 1:56:51.420\n So yes.\n\n1:56:51.420 --> 1:56:53.740\n So Anki, there's a bunch of,\n\n1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:54.900\n it's called Space Repetitions.\n\n1:56:54.900 --> 1:56:57.060\n There's a bunch of apps that are much nicer than Anki.\n\n1:56:57.060 --> 1:57:00.500\n Anki is the ghetto, like Craigslist version,\n\n1:57:00.500 --> 1:57:02.940\n but it has a giant community because people are like,\n\n1:57:02.940 --> 1:57:04.540\n we don't want features.\n\n1:57:04.540 --> 1:57:06.620\n We want a text box.\n\n1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:08.820\n Like it's very basic, very stripped down.\n\n1:57:08.820 --> 1:57:09.900\n So you can drop in stuff.\n\n1:57:09.900 --> 1:57:10.740\n You can drop it.\n\n1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:11.580\n That sounds really,\n\n1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:13.460\n I can't believe I have not come across this.\n\n1:57:13.460 --> 1:57:15.100\n You actually, once you look into it,\n\n1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:18.300\n you'll realize that how have I not come,\n\n1:57:18.300 --> 1:57:20.100\n you are the person,\n\n1:57:20.100 --> 1:57:22.020\n I guarantee you'll probably write a blog about it.\n\n1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:23.260\n I can't believe you actually have it.\n\n1:57:23.260 --> 1:57:24.100\n Well, it's also just like.\n\n1:57:24.100 --> 1:57:25.100\n It's your people too.\n\n1:57:25.100 --> 1:57:28.220\n And my people say, what do you write about?\n\n1:57:28.220 --> 1:57:30.740\n Literally anything I find interesting.\n\n1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:33.740\n And so for me, once you start a blog,\n\n1:57:33.740 --> 1:57:36.700\n like your entire worldview becomes,\n\n1:57:36.700 --> 1:57:37.700\n would this be a good blog post?\n\n1:57:37.700 --> 1:57:39.220\n Would this be, I mean, that's the lens\n\n1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:40.260\n I see everything through,\n\n1:57:40.260 --> 1:57:42.780\n but I constantly coming across something\n\n1:57:42.780 --> 1:57:46.380\n or just a tweet, something that I'm like,\n\n1:57:46.380 --> 1:57:47.940\n ooh, I need to like share this with my readers.\n\n1:57:47.940 --> 1:57:52.740\n My readers to me are like my friends who I'm like,\n\n1:57:52.740 --> 1:57:53.900\n I'm gonna, oh, I need to show,\n\n1:57:53.900 --> 1:57:55.260\n I need to tell them about this.\n\n1:57:55.260 --> 1:57:56.420\n And so I feel like just a place to,\n\n1:57:56.420 --> 1:57:58.100\n I mean, I collect things in a document right now,\n\n1:57:58.100 --> 1:57:58.940\n if it's like really good,\n\n1:57:58.940 --> 1:58:01.020\n but it's the little factoids and stuff like that.\n\n1:58:01.020 --> 1:58:02.780\n I think, especially if I'm learning something,\n\n1:58:02.780 --> 1:58:03.620\n if I'm like.\n\n1:58:03.620 --> 1:58:05.140\n So the problem is when you say stuff,\n\n1:58:05.140 --> 1:58:07.940\n when you look at it, like tweet and all that kind of stuff\n\n1:58:07.940 --> 1:58:11.540\n is you also need to couple that with a system for review.\n\n1:58:11.540 --> 1:58:14.060\n Cause what Anki does is like literally,\n\n1:58:14.060 --> 1:58:16.460\n it determines for me, I don't have to do anything.\n\n1:58:16.460 --> 1:58:18.660\n There's this giant pile of things I've saved\n\n1:58:18.660 --> 1:58:23.660\n and it brings up to me, okay, here's, I don't know.\n\n1:58:25.380 --> 1:58:27.700\n When Churchill did something, right?\n\n1:58:27.700 --> 1:58:29.860\n I'm reading about World War II a lot now,\n\n1:58:29.860 --> 1:58:31.900\n like a particular event, here's that.\n\n1:58:31.900 --> 1:58:33.940\n Do you remember when, what year that happened?\n\n1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:38.700\n And you say yes or no, or like you get to pick,\n\n1:58:38.700 --> 1:58:42.100\n you get to see the answer and you get to self evaluate\n\n1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:43.380\n how well you remember that fact.\n\n1:58:43.380 --> 1:58:44.340\n And if you remember well,\n\n1:58:44.340 --> 1:58:46.900\n it'll be another month before you see it again.\n\n1:58:46.900 --> 1:58:48.900\n If you don't remember, it'll bring it up again.\n\n1:58:48.900 --> 1:58:52.260\n That's a way to review tweets, to review concepts.\n\n1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:54.740\n And it offloads the kind of,\n\n1:58:54.740 --> 1:58:56.340\n the process of selecting which parts\n\n1:58:56.340 --> 1:58:57.420\n you're supposed to review or not.\n\n1:58:57.420 --> 1:58:58.980\n And you can grow that library.\n\n1:58:58.980 --> 1:59:00.820\n I mean, obviously medical students use it\n\n1:59:00.820 --> 1:59:04.100\n for like tens of thousands of facts and it's.\n\n1:59:04.100 --> 1:59:05.140\n It just gamifies it too.\n\n1:59:05.140 --> 1:59:07.820\n It's like you can passively sit back and just,\n\n1:59:07.820 --> 1:59:09.140\n and the thing will like make sure\n\n1:59:09.140 --> 1:59:10.300\n you eventually learn it all.\n\n1:59:10.300 --> 1:59:13.500\n This is, you know, you don't have to be the executive\n\n1:59:13.500 --> 1:59:15.340\n calling that like the program,\n\n1:59:15.340 --> 1:59:17.500\n the memorization program someone else is handling.\n\n1:59:17.500 --> 1:59:20.900\n I would love to hear about like you trying it out\n\n1:59:20.900 --> 1:59:22.380\n or space repetition as an idea.\n\n1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:24.860\n There's a few other apps, but Anki's the big master.\n\n1:59:24.860 --> 1:59:26.180\n I totally want to try.\n\n1:59:26.180 --> 1:59:29.180\n You've written and spoken quite a bit about procrastination.\n\n1:59:29.180 --> 1:59:32.820\n I like you suffer from procrastination\n\n1:59:32.820 --> 1:59:35.940\n like many other people, suffering quotes.\n\n1:59:37.660 --> 1:59:39.740\n How do we avoid procrastination?\n\n1:59:39.740 --> 1:59:42.040\n I don't think the suffer is in quotes.\n\n1:59:43.620 --> 1:59:45.680\n I think that's a huge part of the problem\n\n1:59:45.680 --> 1:59:48.920\n is that it's treated like a silly problem.\n\n1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:55.060\n People don't take it seriously as a dire problem,\n\n1:59:56.260 --> 1:59:57.880\n but it can be.\n\n1:59:57.880 --> 2:00:00.920\n It can ruin your life.\n\n2:00:03.220 --> 2:00:08.220\n There's like, we talked about the compiling concept\n\n2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:11.340\n with, you know, if you read a little,\n\n2:00:11.340 --> 2:00:14.660\n you know, if you write, if you write two pages a week,\n\n2:00:15.580 --> 2:00:16.700\n you write a book every two years,\n\n2:00:16.700 --> 2:00:18.180\n you're a prolific writer, right?\n\n2:00:18.180 --> 2:00:20.260\n And the difference between, you know,\n\n2:00:20.260 --> 2:00:22.580\n again, it's not that that person's working so hard.\n\n2:00:22.580 --> 2:00:24.660\n It's that they have the ability to,\n\n2:00:24.660 --> 2:00:26.460\n when they commit to something like on Sunday mornings,\n\n2:00:26.460 --> 2:00:27.720\n I'm gonna write two pages.\n\n2:00:27.720 --> 2:00:28.560\n That's it.\n\n2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:33.860\n They respect, they have enough,\n\n2:00:33.860 --> 2:00:36.780\n they respect the part of them that made that decision\n\n2:00:36.780 --> 2:00:39.460\n is a respected character in their brain.\n\n2:00:39.460 --> 2:00:41.300\n And they say, well, that's, I decided it,\n\n2:00:41.300 --> 2:00:43.100\n so I'm gonna do it.\n\n2:00:43.100 --> 2:00:46.780\n The procrastinator won't do those two pages.\n\n2:00:46.780 --> 2:00:48.580\n That's just exactly the kind of thing\n\n2:00:48.580 --> 2:00:50.060\n the procrastinator will keep on their list\n\n2:00:50.060 --> 2:00:51.020\n and they will not do.\n\n2:00:51.020 --> 2:00:53.420\n But that doesn't mean they're any less talented\n\n2:00:53.420 --> 2:00:54.980\n than the writer who does the two pages.\n\n2:00:54.980 --> 2:00:57.380\n Doesn't mean they want it any less.\n\n2:00:57.380 --> 2:00:58.900\n Maybe they want it even more.\n\n2:00:58.900 --> 2:01:01.280\n And it doesn't mean that they wouldn't be just as happy\n\n2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:03.660\n having done it as the writer who does it.\n\n2:01:03.660 --> 2:01:05.100\n So what they're missing out on,\n\n2:01:05.100 --> 2:01:07.980\n picture a writer who writes 10 books, you know,\n\n2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:11.100\n bestsellers, and they go on these book tours\n\n2:01:11.100 --> 2:01:15.300\n and, you know, they, and they just are so gratified\n\n2:01:15.300 --> 2:01:16.260\n with their career and, you know,\n\n2:01:16.260 --> 2:01:20.600\n and they think about what the other person is missing\n\n2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:23.480\n who does none of that, right?\n\n2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:27.780\n So that is a massive loss, a massive loss.\n\n2:01:27.780 --> 2:01:32.020\n And it's because the internal mechanism in their brain\n\n2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:33.900\n is not doing what the other person's is.\n\n2:01:33.900 --> 2:01:36.540\n So they don't have the respect for the part of them\n\n2:01:36.540 --> 2:01:37.980\n that made the choice.\n\n2:01:37.980 --> 2:01:40.020\n They feel like it's someone they can disregard.\n\n2:01:40.020 --> 2:01:42.760\n And so to me, it's in the same boat\n\n2:01:42.760 --> 2:01:47.180\n as someone who is obese because their eating habits\n\n2:01:47.180 --> 2:01:50.800\n make them obese over time or their exercise habits.\n\n2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:54.360\n So that, you know, that's a huge loss for that person.\n\n2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:56.720\n That person is, you know, the health problems\n\n2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:59.040\n and it's just probably making them miserable.\n\n2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:01.960\n And it's self inflicted, right?\n\n2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:05.760\n It's self defeating, but that doesn't make an easy problem\n\n2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:07.520\n to fix just because you're doing it to yourself.\n\n2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:09.400\n So to me, procrastination is another one of these\n\n2:02:09.400 --> 2:02:11.840\n where you are the only person in your own way.\n\n2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:15.260\n You are, you know, you are failing at something\n\n2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:17.640\n or not doing something that you really want to do.\n\n2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:18.920\n You know, it doesn't have to be work.\n\n2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:21.280\n Maybe you're, you want to get out of that marriage\n\n2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:23.080\n that you know, you realize it hits you.\n\n2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:24.320\n You shouldn't be in this marriage.\n\n2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:26.540\n You should get divorced and you wait 20 extra years\n\n2:02:26.540 --> 2:02:28.640\n before you do it or you don't do it at all.\n\n2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:33.700\n That is, you know, you're not living the life\n\n2:02:33.700 --> 2:02:35.120\n that you know you should be living, right?\n\n2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:38.040\n And so I think it's fascinating.\n\n2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:39.960\n Now, the problem is it's also a funny problem\n\n2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:43.040\n because there's short term procrastination,\n\n2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:44.240\n which I talk about as, you know,\n\n2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:45.720\n the kind that has a deadline.\n\n2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:48.000\n Now, some people, you know,\n\n2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.520\n this is when I bring in, there's different characters.\n\n2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:52.520\n There's the panic monster comes in the room\n\n2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:54.440\n and that's when you actually, you know,\n\n2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:57.720\n the procrastinator can, there's different levels.\n\n2:02:57.720 --> 2:03:02.480\n There's the kind that even when there's a deadline,\n\n2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:03.600\n they stop panicking.\n\n2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:04.600\n They just, they've given up\n\n2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:06.420\n and they really have a problem.\n\n2:03:06.420 --> 2:03:08.280\n Then there's the kind that when there's a deadline,\n\n2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:10.440\n they'll do it, but they'll wait till the last second.\n\n2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:13.260\n Both of those people, I think have a huge problem\n\n2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:15.640\n once there's no deadline because,\n\n2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:17.400\n and most of the important things in life,\n\n2:03:17.400 --> 2:03:18.480\n there's no deadline, which is, you know,\n\n2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:21.120\n changing your career, you know,\n\n2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.180\n becoming a writer when you never have been before,\n\n2:03:23.180 --> 2:03:24.840\n getting out of your relationship,\n\n2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:28.480\n you know, be doing whatever you need to,\n\n2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:29.580\n the changes you need to make\n\n2:03:29.580 --> 2:03:31.020\n in order to get into a relation.\n\n2:03:31.020 --> 2:03:32.680\n There's a thing after it.\n\n2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:33.760\n Launching a startup.\n\n2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:35.360\n Launching a startup, right?\n\n2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:37.280\n Or once you've launched a startup,\n\n2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:40.080\n firing is the right, someone that needs to be fired, right?\n\n2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:41.920\n I mean, going out for fundraising\n\n2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:43.360\n instead of just trying to, you know,\n\n2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:46.400\n there's so many moments when the big change\n\n2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:48.320\n that you know you should be making\n\n2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:49.960\n that would completely change your life\n\n2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:53.200\n if you just did it has no deadline.\n\n2:03:53.200 --> 2:03:55.560\n It just has to be coming from yourself.\n\n2:03:55.560 --> 2:04:00.560\n And I think that a ton of people have a problem\n\n2:04:01.060 --> 2:04:04.880\n where they will, they think this delusion\n\n2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:05.840\n that, you know, I'm gonna do that.\n\n2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:07.240\n I'm definitely gonna do that, you know,\n\n2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:09.360\n but not this week, not this month,\n\n2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:10.840\n not today, because whatever.\n\n2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:12.280\n And they make this excuse again and again,\n\n2:04:12.280 --> 2:04:15.060\n and it just sits there on their list collecting dust.\n\n2:04:15.060 --> 2:04:20.060\n And so, yeah, to me, it is a very real suffering.\n\n2:04:20.660 --> 2:04:23.740\n And the fix isn't fixing the habits.\n\n2:04:23.740 --> 2:04:27.580\n Just like not working on the fix, first of all.\n\n2:04:27.580 --> 2:04:30.680\n So there's, okay, there is,\n\n2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:34.980\n there's, just that you have a boat that sucks\n\n2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:37.300\n and it's leaking and it's gonna sink.\n\n2:04:37.300 --> 2:04:40.060\n You can fix it with duct tape for a couple of,\n\n2:04:40.060 --> 2:04:42.280\n you know, for one ride or whatever.\n\n2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:43.760\n That's not really fixing the boat,\n\n2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:44.860\n but you can get you by.\n\n2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:47.300\n So there's duct tape solutions.\n\n2:04:47.300 --> 2:04:49.180\n To me, so the panic monster is the character\n\n2:04:49.180 --> 2:04:52.100\n that rushes into the room once the deadline gets too close\n\n2:04:52.100 --> 2:04:54.560\n or once there's some scary external pressure,\n\n2:04:54.560 --> 2:04:55.500\n not just from yourself.\n\n2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:59.140\n And that's a huge aid to a lot of procrastinators.\n\n2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:00.820\n Again, there's a lot of people who won't,\n\n2:05:00.820 --> 2:05:02.140\n you know, do that thing.\n\n2:05:02.140 --> 2:05:03.700\n They've been writing that book they wanted to write,\n\n2:05:03.700 --> 2:05:05.060\n but there's way fewer people\n\n2:05:05.060 --> 2:05:07.100\n who will not show up to the exam.\n\n2:05:07.100 --> 2:05:08.940\n You know, most people show up to the exam.\n\n2:05:08.940 --> 2:05:12.380\n So that's because the panic monster\n\n2:05:12.380 --> 2:05:14.640\n is gonna freak out if they don't.\n\n2:05:14.640 --> 2:05:16.660\n So you can create a panic monster.\n\n2:05:16.660 --> 2:05:19.340\n If you wanna, you know, you really wanna write music,\n\n2:05:19.340 --> 2:05:20.800\n you really wanna become a singer, songwriter,\n\n2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:25.620\n well, book a venue, tell 40 people about it\n\n2:05:25.620 --> 2:05:28.020\n and say, hey, on, you know, this day, two months from now,\n\n2:05:28.020 --> 2:05:30.340\n come and see, I'm gonna play you some of my songs.\n\n2:05:30.340 --> 2:05:31.940\n You now have a panic monster, you're gonna write songs.\n\n2:05:31.940 --> 2:05:33.400\n You're gonna have to, right?\n\n2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:37.460\n So there's duct tape things.\n\n2:05:37.460 --> 2:05:39.100\n You know, you can do things, you know, people do,\n\n2:05:39.100 --> 2:05:41.560\n I've done a lot of this with a friend and I say,\n\n2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:44.620\n if I don't get X done by a week from now,\n\n2:05:44.620 --> 2:05:47.380\n I have to donate a lot of money\n\n2:05:47.380 --> 2:05:48.300\n somewhere I don't wanna donate.\n\n2:05:48.300 --> 2:05:49.460\n And that's, you would put that\n\n2:05:49.460 --> 2:05:51.500\n in the category of duct tape solutions.\n\n2:05:51.500 --> 2:05:55.240\n Yeah, because it's not, why do I need that, right?\n\n2:05:55.240 --> 2:05:56.560\n If I really had solved this,\n\n2:05:56.560 --> 2:05:58.980\n this is something I want to do for me, it's selfish.\n\n2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:01.420\n This is, I just literally just want to be selfish here\n\n2:06:01.420 --> 2:06:02.740\n and do the work I need to do\n\n2:06:02.740 --> 2:06:04.300\n to get the goals I wanna get, right?\n\n2:06:04.300 --> 2:06:07.500\n There's a much, all the incentives\n\n2:06:07.500 --> 2:06:08.580\n should be in the right place.\n\n2:06:08.580 --> 2:06:10.460\n And yet, if I don't say that,\n\n2:06:10.460 --> 2:06:12.060\n it'll be a week from now and I won't have done it.\n\n2:06:12.060 --> 2:06:14.100\n Something weird is going on, there's some resistance,\n\n2:06:14.100 --> 2:06:16.020\n there's some force that is prevent,\n\n2:06:16.020 --> 2:06:17.800\n that is in my own way, right?\n\n2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:21.180\n And so doing something where I have to pay all this money,\n\n2:06:21.180 --> 2:06:22.500\n okay, now I'll panic and I'll do it.\n\n2:06:22.500 --> 2:06:23.940\n So that's duct tape.\n\n2:06:23.940 --> 2:06:27.380\n Fixing the boat is something where I don't have to do that.\n\n2:06:27.380 --> 2:06:29.100\n I just will do the things that I,\n\n2:06:29.100 --> 2:06:33.060\n again, it's not, I'm talking about super crazy work ethic.\n\n2:06:33.060 --> 2:06:36.540\n Just like, for example, okay, I have a lot of examples\n\n2:06:36.540 --> 2:06:40.140\n because I have a serious problem that I've been working on.\n\n2:06:40.140 --> 2:06:41.740\n And in some ways I've gotten really successful\n\n2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:44.740\n at solving it and in other ways I'm still floundering.\n\n2:06:44.740 --> 2:06:45.580\n So.\n\n2:06:45.580 --> 2:06:47.540\n Yeah, the world's greatest duct taper.\n\n2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:49.980\n Yes, well, I'm pretty good at duct taping.\n\n2:06:49.980 --> 2:06:52.420\n I probably could be even better and I'm like, and I'm.\n\n2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:54.860\n You're procrastinating and becoming a better duct taper.\n\n2:06:54.860 --> 2:06:57.540\n Literally, like, yes, there's nothing, I won't.\n\n2:06:57.540 --> 2:07:00.780\n So here's what I know what I should do as a writer, right?\n\n2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:03.640\n It's very obvious to me is that I should wake up.\n\n2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:04.480\n Doesn't have to be crazy,\n\n2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:06.020\n I don't wanna 6 a.m. or anything insane\n\n2:07:06.020 --> 2:07:10.620\n or I'm not gonna be one of those crazy people at 5.30 jogs.\n\n2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:14.380\n I'm gonna wake up at whatever, you know, 7.30, 8, 8.30\n\n2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:17.300\n and I should have a block, like, just say nine to noon\n\n2:07:18.620 --> 2:07:22.900\n where I get up and I just really quick make some coffee\n\n2:07:22.900 --> 2:07:23.740\n and write.\n\n2:07:23.740 --> 2:07:26.900\n It's obvious because all the great writers in history\n\n2:07:26.900 --> 2:07:28.200\n did exactly that, some.\n\n2:07:28.200 --> 2:07:30.140\n Some of them have done that, that's common.\n\n2:07:30.140 --> 2:07:31.520\n There's some that I like these writers,\n\n2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:32.700\n they do the late night sessions,\n\n2:07:32.700 --> 2:07:33.540\n but most of them they do wake up.\n\n2:07:33.540 --> 2:07:36.280\n But there's a session, but there's a session that's.\n\n2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:38.460\n Most writers write in the morning and there's a reason.\n\n2:07:38.460 --> 2:07:41.060\n I don't think I'm different than those people.\n\n2:07:41.060 --> 2:07:43.780\n It's a great time to write, you're fresh, right?\n\n2:07:43.780 --> 2:07:46.820\n Your ideas from dreaming have kind of collected,\n\n2:07:46.820 --> 2:07:48.540\n you have all, you know, new answers\n\n2:07:48.540 --> 2:07:51.140\n that you didn't have yesterday and you can just go.\n\n2:07:51.140 --> 2:07:53.340\n But more importantly, if I just had a routine\n\n2:07:53.340 --> 2:07:58.000\n where I wrote from nine to noon, weekdays.\n\n2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:02.260\n Every week would have a minimum of 15 focused hours\n\n2:08:02.260 --> 2:08:04.700\n of writing, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a lot.\n\n2:08:04.700 --> 2:08:06.940\n A 15, 15, no, this is no joke.\n\n2:08:06.940 --> 2:08:09.600\n This is, you know, you're not, your phone's away,\n\n2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:11.660\n you're not talking to anyone, you're not opening your email,\n\n2:08:11.660 --> 2:08:14.100\n you are focused writing for three hours, five.\n\n2:08:14.100 --> 2:08:16.580\n That's a big week for most writers, right?\n\n2:08:16.580 --> 2:08:18.820\n So now what's happening is that every weekday\n\n2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:21.460\n is a minimum of a B, I'll give myself.\n\n2:08:21.460 --> 2:08:23.100\n You know, an A might be, you know, wow,\n\n2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:24.960\n I really just got into a flow and wrote for six hours\n\n2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:26.080\n and had, you know, great.\n\n2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:28.700\n But it's a minimum of a B, I can keep going if I want.\n\n2:08:28.700 --> 2:08:31.380\n And every week is a minimum of a B with those 15 hours.\n\n2:08:31.380 --> 2:08:32.980\n Right, and if I just had, talk about compiling,\n\n2:08:32.980 --> 2:08:34.300\n if I, this is the two pages a week.\n\n2:08:34.300 --> 2:08:37.060\n If I just did that every week,\n\n2:08:37.060 --> 2:08:39.020\n I'd achieve all my writing goals in my life.\n\n2:08:39.020 --> 2:08:42.620\n And yet I wake up and most days I just,\n\n2:08:42.620 --> 2:08:44.900\n either I'll revenge procrastination late at night\n\n2:08:44.900 --> 2:08:46.380\n and go to bed way too late and then wake up later\n\n2:08:46.380 --> 2:08:47.860\n and get on a bad schedule and I just fall\n\n2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:48.700\n into these bad schedules.\n\n2:08:48.700 --> 2:08:50.740\n Or I'll wake up and there's just, you know,\n\n2:08:50.740 --> 2:08:52.940\n I'll say I was gonna do a few emails and I'll open it up\n\n2:08:52.940 --> 2:08:54.900\n and I'm suddenly on text and I'm texting.\n\n2:08:54.900 --> 2:08:56.860\n Or I'll just go and, you know, I'll make a phone call\n\n2:08:56.860 --> 2:08:58.220\n and I'll be on phone calls for three hours.\n\n2:08:58.220 --> 2:08:59.420\n It's always something.\n\n2:08:59.420 --> 2:09:00.260\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:02.100\n Or I'll start writing and then I hit a little bit of a wall,\n\n2:09:02.100 --> 2:09:03.420\n but because there's no sacred,\n\n2:09:03.420 --> 2:09:05.300\n this is a sacred writing block,\n\n2:09:05.300 --> 2:09:07.540\n I'll just hit the wall and say, well, this is icky\n\n2:09:07.540 --> 2:09:08.900\n and I'll go do something else.\n\n2:09:08.900 --> 2:09:11.400\n So duct tape, what I've done is,\n\n2:09:12.780 --> 2:09:14.460\n White But Why has one employee, Alisha.\n\n2:09:14.460 --> 2:09:16.100\n She's the manager of lots of things.\n\n2:09:16.100 --> 2:09:17.300\n That's her role.\n\n2:09:17.300 --> 2:09:19.020\n She truly does lots of things.\n\n2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:24.020\n And one of the things we started doing is,\n\n2:09:24.020 --> 2:09:25.980\n either she comes over and sits next to me\n\n2:09:25.980 --> 2:09:29.300\n where she can see my screen from nine to noon.\n\n2:09:29.300 --> 2:09:30.120\n That's all it takes.\n\n2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:31.580\n The thing about procrastination is there's usually,\n\n2:09:31.580 --> 2:09:32.880\n they're not kicking and screaming.\n\n2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:33.760\n I don't want to do this.\n\n2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:35.300\n It's the feeling of, you know, in the old days\n\n2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:36.780\n when you had to go to class,\n\n2:09:36.780 --> 2:09:38.540\n you know, your lunch block is over and it's like,\n\n2:09:38.540 --> 2:09:40.100\n oh, shit, I have class in five minutes.\n\n2:09:40.100 --> 2:09:42.600\n Or it's Monday morning, you go, oh.\n\n2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:43.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:44.260\n But you said, you know what?\n\n2:09:44.260 --> 2:09:45.100\n But you go, you say, okay.\n\n2:09:45.100 --> 2:09:46.500\n And then you get to class and it's not that bad\n\n2:09:46.500 --> 2:09:48.260\n once you're there, right?\n\n2:09:48.260 --> 2:09:49.900\n You know, you have a trainer and he says, okay, next set.\n\n2:09:49.900 --> 2:09:50.860\n And you go, oh, okay.\n\n2:09:50.860 --> 2:09:51.700\n And you do it.\n\n2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:52.520\n That's all it is.\n\n2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:55.420\n It's someone, some external thing being like,\n\n2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:56.340\n okay, I have to do this.\n\n2:09:56.340 --> 2:09:58.300\n And then you have that moment of like, it sucks,\n\n2:09:58.300 --> 2:09:59.220\n but I guess I'll do it.\n\n2:09:59.220 --> 2:10:03.340\n If no one's there though, the problem with the procrastinator\n\n2:10:03.340 --> 2:10:04.180\n is they don't have that person in their head.\n\n2:10:04.180 --> 2:10:05.500\n Other people I think were raised with a sense of shame\n\n2:10:05.500 --> 2:10:06.340\n if they don't do stuff.\n\n2:10:06.340 --> 2:10:09.740\n And that stick in their head is hugely helpful.\n\n2:10:09.740 --> 2:10:11.020\n I don't really have that.\n\n2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:14.180\n And so anyway, Alicia is sitting there next to me.\n\n2:10:15.140 --> 2:10:17.180\n So she's doing her own work, but she can see my screen\n\n2:10:17.180 --> 2:10:19.620\n and she of all people knows exactly what I should be doing,\n\n2:10:19.620 --> 2:10:21.260\n what I shouldn't be doing.\n\n2:10:21.260 --> 2:10:22.500\n That's all it takes.\n\n2:10:22.500 --> 2:10:24.780\n The shame of just having her see me\n\n2:10:24.780 --> 2:10:26.020\n while she's sitting there not working\n\n2:10:26.020 --> 2:10:27.740\n would just be too, it's too weird and too embarrassing.\n\n2:10:27.740 --> 2:10:29.700\n So I get it done and it's amazing.\n\n2:10:29.700 --> 2:10:31.580\n It's a game changer for me.\n\n2:10:31.580 --> 2:10:34.740\n So duct tape can solve, sometimes duct tape is enough,\n\n2:10:34.740 --> 2:10:39.260\n but I'm curious to, I'm still trying to, what is going on?\n\n2:10:39.260 --> 2:10:40.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:43.580\n I think part of it is that we are actually wired.\n\n2:10:43.580 --> 2:10:47.220\n I think I'm being very sane human actually\n\n2:10:47.220 --> 2:10:48.060\n is what's happening.\n\n2:10:48.060 --> 2:10:48.880\n Or not sane is not the right word.\n\n2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:52.020\n I'm being like, I'm being a natural human\n\n2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:55.500\n that we are not programmed to sit there and do homework\n\n2:10:55.500 --> 2:10:58.620\n of a certain kind that we get the results like\n\n2:10:58.620 --> 2:10:59.660\n six months later.\n\n2:10:59.660 --> 2:11:03.120\n Like that is not, so we're supposed to conserve energy\n\n2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:05.060\n and fulfill our needs as we need them\n\n2:11:05.060 --> 2:11:06.700\n and do immediate things.\n\n2:11:06.700 --> 2:11:10.300\n And we're overriding our natural ways\n\n2:11:10.300 --> 2:11:12.060\n when we wake up and get to it.\n\n2:11:12.060 --> 2:11:14.500\n And I think sometimes it's because the pain,\n\n2:11:14.500 --> 2:11:15.980\n I think a lot of times we're just avoiding suffering\n\n2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:18.580\n and for a lot of people, the pain of not doing it\n\n2:11:18.580 --> 2:11:20.660\n is actually worse because they feel shame.\n\n2:11:20.660 --> 2:11:22.220\n So if they don't get up and take a jog\n\n2:11:22.220 --> 2:11:23.580\n and get up early and get to work,\n\n2:11:23.580 --> 2:11:25.820\n I'll feel like a bad person.\n\n2:11:25.820 --> 2:11:28.060\n And that is worse than doing those things.\n\n2:11:28.060 --> 2:11:29.500\n And then it becomes a habit eventually\n\n2:11:29.500 --> 2:11:31.380\n and it becomes just easy automatic.\n\n2:11:31.380 --> 2:11:33.280\n It becomes I do it because that's what I do.\n\n2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:35.100\n But I think that if you don't have a lot of shame\n\n2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:38.020\n necessarily, the pain of doing those things\n\n2:11:38.020 --> 2:11:42.260\n is worse in the immediate moment than not doing it.\n\n2:11:42.260 --> 2:11:44.100\n But I think that there's this feeling\n\n2:11:44.100 --> 2:11:46.280\n that you capture with your body language\n\n2:11:46.280 --> 2:11:50.100\n and so on, like I don't want to do another set.\n\n2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:53.540\n That feeling, the people I've seen that are good\n\n2:11:53.540 --> 2:11:55.460\n at not procrastinating are the ones\n\n2:11:55.460 --> 2:11:58.580\n that have trained themselves to like the moment\n\n2:11:58.580 --> 2:12:00.020\n they would be having that feeling.\n\n2:12:00.020 --> 2:12:03.800\n They just, it's like Zen, like Sam Harris style Zen.\n\n2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:05.580\n You don't experience that feeling.\n\n2:12:05.580 --> 2:12:06.940\n You just march forward.\n\n2:12:06.940 --> 2:12:09.820\n Like I talked to Elon about this a lot actually offline.\n\n2:12:09.820 --> 2:12:11.700\n It's like, he doesn't have this.\n\n2:12:11.700 --> 2:12:12.900\n No, clearly not.\n\n2:12:12.900 --> 2:12:16.060\n It's the way I think, at least he talks about it\n\n2:12:16.060 --> 2:12:18.060\n and the way I think about it is it's like\n\n2:12:18.060 --> 2:12:21.620\n you just pretend you're like a machine running an algorithm.\n\n2:12:21.620 --> 2:12:24.580\n Like you know this, you should be doing this.\n\n2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:26.100\n Not because somebody told you so on.\n\n2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:28.520\n This is probably the thing you want to do.\n\n2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:30.420\n Like look at the big picture of your life\n\n2:12:30.420 --> 2:12:31.580\n and just run the algorithm.\n\n2:12:31.580 --> 2:12:33.540\n Like ignore your feelings, just run as if.\n\n2:12:33.540 --> 2:12:35.260\n But it's framing, frame it differently.\n\n2:12:35.260 --> 2:12:36.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:36.100 --> 2:12:38.020\n You know, yeah, you can frame it as like,\n\n2:12:38.020 --> 2:12:40.800\n it can feel like homework or it can feel like\n\n2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:42.420\n you're like, you're living your best life\n\n2:12:42.420 --> 2:12:43.940\n or something when you're doing your work.\n\n2:12:43.940 --> 2:12:46.380\n Yeah, and maybe reframe it.\n\n2:12:46.380 --> 2:12:48.580\n But I think ultimately is whatever reframing\n\n2:12:48.580 --> 2:12:52.340\n you need to do, you just need to do it for a few weeks.\n\n2:12:52.340 --> 2:12:56.980\n And that's how the habit is formed and you stick with it.\n\n2:12:56.980 --> 2:13:01.980\n Like I'm now on a kick where I exercise every day.\n\n2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:06.180\n It doesn't matter what that exercise is.\n\n2:13:06.180 --> 2:13:07.420\n It's not serious.\n\n2:13:07.420 --> 2:13:11.060\n It could be 200 pushups, but it's the thing that like\n\n2:13:11.060 --> 2:13:12.380\n I make sure I exercise every day\n\n2:13:12.380 --> 2:13:15.540\n and it's become way, way easier because of the habit.\n\n2:13:15.540 --> 2:13:19.660\n And I just, and I don't like, at least with exercise\n\n2:13:19.660 --> 2:13:22.140\n because it's easier to replicate that feeling.\n\n2:13:22.140 --> 2:13:24.420\n I don't allow myself to go like,\n\n2:13:24.420 --> 2:13:25.340\n I don't feel like doing this.\n\n2:13:25.340 --> 2:13:26.180\n Right.\n\n2:13:26.180 --> 2:13:27.460\n Well, I think about that, even just like little things,\n\n2:13:27.460 --> 2:13:29.260\n like I brush my teeth before I go to bed\n\n2:13:29.260 --> 2:13:30.260\n and it's just a habit.\n\n2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:31.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:31.100 --> 2:13:31.940\n And it is effort.\n\n2:13:31.940 --> 2:13:34.340\n Like if it were something else, I would be like,\n\n2:13:34.340 --> 2:13:35.860\n oh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom and go do that.\n\n2:13:35.860 --> 2:13:37.660\n And I just want to like, I'm just gonna lie down right now.\n\n2:13:37.660 --> 2:13:38.860\n But it doesn't even cross my mind.\n\n2:13:38.860 --> 2:13:41.380\n It's just like that I just robotically go and do it.\n\n2:13:41.380 --> 2:13:42.220\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:42.220 --> 2:13:43.640\n And it almost has become like a nice routine.\n\n2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:44.940\n It's like, oh, this part of the night, you know,\n\n2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:47.500\n it's like a morning routine for me stuff is like,\n\n2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:50.060\n you know, that stuff is kind of just like automated.\n\n2:13:50.060 --> 2:13:52.700\n Yeah, it's funny because you don't like go,\n\n2:13:52.700 --> 2:13:54.460\n like I don't think I've skipped many days.\n\n2:13:54.460 --> 2:13:56.540\n I don't think I skipped any days brushing my teeth.\n\n2:13:56.540 --> 2:13:57.380\n Right.\n\n2:13:57.380 --> 2:13:59.080\n Like unless I didn't have a toothbrush,\n\n2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:00.620\n like I was in the woods or something.\n\n2:14:00.620 --> 2:14:01.440\n And what is that?\n\n2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:02.280\n Because it's annoying.\n\n2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:04.420\n Well, so to me, there is,\n\n2:14:04.420 --> 2:14:06.100\n so the character that makes me procrastinate\n\n2:14:06.100 --> 2:14:08.140\n is the instant gratification monkey.\n\n2:14:08.140 --> 2:14:09.540\n That's what I've labeled him, right?\n\n2:14:09.540 --> 2:14:11.260\n And there's the rational decision maker\n\n2:14:11.260 --> 2:14:12.420\n and the instant gratification monkey\n\n2:14:12.420 --> 2:14:14.160\n and these battle with each other.\n\n2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:18.060\n But for procrastinator, the monkey wins.\n\n2:14:18.060 --> 2:14:18.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:14:18.900 --> 2:14:20.780\n I don't think the monkey is, you know,\n\n2:14:20.780 --> 2:14:21.820\n you read about this kind of stuff.\n\n2:14:21.820 --> 2:14:25.900\n I think that this kind of more primitive brain\n\n2:14:25.900 --> 2:14:26.820\n is always winning.\n\n2:14:26.820 --> 2:14:28.180\n And in the non procrastinators,\n\n2:14:28.180 --> 2:14:30.580\n that primitive brain is on board for some reason\n\n2:14:31.780 --> 2:14:32.660\n and isn't resisting.\n\n2:14:32.660 --> 2:14:35.080\n So, but when I think about brushing my teeth,\n\n2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:36.700\n it's like the monkey doesn't even think\n\n2:14:36.700 --> 2:14:38.520\n there's an option to not do it.\n\n2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:40.380\n So it doesn't even like get, there's no hope.\n\n2:14:40.380 --> 2:14:41.820\n Monkey has no hope there.\n\n2:14:41.820 --> 2:14:43.140\n So it doesn't even like get involved.\n\n2:14:43.140 --> 2:14:44.340\n And it's just like, yeah, you know, we have to,\n\n2:14:44.340 --> 2:14:46.820\n just like kind of like robotically, just like, you know,\n\n2:14:46.820 --> 2:14:48.060\n it was kind of like Stockholm syndrome,\n\n2:14:48.060 --> 2:14:50.460\n just like, oh no, no, I have to do this.\n\n2:14:50.460 --> 2:14:51.820\n It doesn't even like wake up.\n\n2:14:51.820 --> 2:14:53.220\n It's like, yeah, we're doing this now.\n\n2:14:53.220 --> 2:14:54.940\n For other things, the monkey's like, ooh, no, no, no.\n\n2:14:54.940 --> 2:14:56.820\n Most days I can win this one.\n\n2:14:56.820 --> 2:15:01.820\n And so the monkey puts up that like fierce resistance\n\n2:15:01.820 --> 2:15:03.860\n and it's like, it's a lot of it's like\n\n2:15:03.860 --> 2:15:05.660\n the initial transition.\n\n2:15:05.660 --> 2:15:09.060\n So I think of it as like jumping in a cold pool\n\n2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:12.580\n where it's like, I will spend the whole day\n\n2:15:12.580 --> 2:15:15.100\n pacing around the side of the pool in my bathing suit,\n\n2:15:15.100 --> 2:15:17.580\n just being like, I don't want to have that one second\n\n2:15:17.580 --> 2:15:18.780\n when you first jump in and it sucks.\n\n2:15:18.780 --> 2:15:20.860\n And then once you're, once I'm in,\n\n2:15:20.860 --> 2:15:21.860\n once I jump in, I'm usually, you know,\n\n2:15:21.860 --> 2:15:23.540\n once I start writing, I'm suddenly I'm like,\n\n2:15:23.540 --> 2:15:24.640\n oh, this isn't so bad.\n\n2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:25.480\n Okay, I'm kind of into it.\n\n2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:27.020\n And then I, then sometimes you can't tear me away.\n\n2:15:27.020 --> 2:15:29.340\n You know, then I suddenly I'm like, I get into a flow.\n\n2:15:29.340 --> 2:15:31.380\n So it's like, once I get into cold water, I don't mind it,\n\n2:15:31.380 --> 2:15:34.900\n but I will spend hours standing around the side of the pool.\n\n2:15:34.900 --> 2:15:36.820\n And by the way, I do this in a more literal sense.\n\n2:15:36.820 --> 2:15:40.440\n When I go to the gym with a trainer in 45 minutes,\n\n2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:41.960\n I do a full full ass workout.\n\n2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:44.820\n And it's not because I'm having a good time,\n\n2:15:44.820 --> 2:15:47.420\n but it's because it's that,\n\n2:15:47.420 --> 2:15:49.080\n oh, okay, I have to go to class feeling, right?\n\n2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:50.540\n But when I go to the gym alone,\n\n2:15:50.540 --> 2:15:55.460\n I will literally do a set and then dick around my phone\n\n2:15:55.460 --> 2:15:57.380\n for 10 minutes before the next set.\n\n2:15:57.380 --> 2:15:59.660\n And I'll spend an over an hour there and do way less.\n\n2:15:59.660 --> 2:16:01.940\n So it is the transition.\n\n2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:03.140\n Once I'm actually doing the set,\n\n2:16:03.140 --> 2:16:04.460\n I'm never like, I don't want to stop in the middle.\n\n2:16:04.460 --> 2:16:05.560\n Now it's just like, I'm going to do this.\n\n2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:07.020\n And I felt happy, I just did it.\n\n2:16:07.020 --> 2:16:07.860\n So it's something,\n\n2:16:07.860 --> 2:16:09.580\n there's something about transitions that is very,\n\n2:16:09.580 --> 2:16:12.980\n that's why procrastinators are late a lot of places.\n\n2:16:12.980 --> 2:16:14.940\n It's, I will procrastinate getting ready\n\n2:16:14.940 --> 2:16:15.940\n to go to the airport,\n\n2:16:16.900 --> 2:16:18.240\n even though I know I should leave at three,\n\n2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:19.220\n so I can not be stressed.\n\n2:16:19.220 --> 2:16:22.420\n I'll leave at 3.36 and I'll be super stressed.\n\n2:16:22.420 --> 2:16:24.700\n Once I'm on the way to the airport,\n\n2:16:24.700 --> 2:16:26.340\n immediately I'm like, why didn't I do this earlier?\n\n2:16:26.340 --> 2:16:28.660\n Now I'm back on my phone doing what I was doing.\n\n2:16:28.660 --> 2:16:31.280\n I just had to get in the damn car or whatever.\n\n2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:35.440\n So yeah, there's some very, very odd irrational.\n\n2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:38.640\n Yeah, like I was waiting for you to come\n\n2:16:38.640 --> 2:16:40.500\n and you said that you're running a few minutes late.\n\n2:16:40.500 --> 2:16:45.500\n And I was like, I was like, I'll go get you a coffee\n\n2:16:45.620 --> 2:16:49.100\n because I can't possibly be the one who's early.\n\n2:16:49.100 --> 2:16:50.460\n I can't, I don't understand.\n\n2:16:50.460 --> 2:16:51.820\n I'm always late to stuff.\n\n2:16:51.820 --> 2:16:54.060\n And I know it's disrespectful\n\n2:16:54.060 --> 2:16:55.340\n in the eyes of a lot of people.\n\n2:16:55.340 --> 2:16:58.200\n I can't help, you know what I'm doing ahead of it?\n\n2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:00.180\n It's not like I don't care about the people.\n\n2:17:00.180 --> 2:17:03.060\n I'm often like, you know, for like this conversation,\n\n2:17:03.060 --> 2:17:04.360\n I'd be preparing more.\n\n2:17:05.620 --> 2:17:08.220\n It's like, I obviously care about the person,\n\n2:17:08.220 --> 2:17:09.060\n but for some.\n\n2:17:09.060 --> 2:17:10.500\n Yeah, it's misinterpreted as like,\n\n2:17:10.500 --> 2:17:13.060\n there are some people that like show up late\n\n2:17:13.060 --> 2:17:15.880\n because they kind of like that quality in themselves.\n\n2:17:15.880 --> 2:17:16.720\n That's a dick, right?\n\n2:17:16.720 --> 2:17:17.680\n There's a lot of those people,\n\n2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:20.340\n but more often it's someone who shows up frazzled\n\n2:17:20.340 --> 2:17:22.780\n and they feel awful and they're furious at themselves.\n\n2:17:22.780 --> 2:17:23.620\n They're so regretful.\n\n2:17:23.620 --> 2:17:24.440\n Exactly.\n\n2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:25.280\n I mean, that's me.\n\n2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:27.800\n And I mean, all you have to do is look at those people alone\n\n2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:29.820\n running through the airport, right?\n\n2:17:29.820 --> 2:17:31.180\n They're not being disrespectful to anyone there.\n\n2:17:31.180 --> 2:17:33.100\n They just inflicted this on themselves.\n\n2:17:33.100 --> 2:17:33.940\n Like.\n\n2:17:33.940 --> 2:17:34.760\n This is hilarious.\n\n2:17:34.760 --> 2:17:35.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:38.660\n You tweeted a quote by James Baldwin saying, quote,\n\n2:17:38.660 --> 2:17:41.600\n I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates\n\n2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:46.600\n so stubbornly is because they sense once hate is gone,\n\n2:17:47.340 --> 2:17:49.580\n they will be forced to deal with the pain.\n\n2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:53.820\n What has been a painful but formative experience\n\n2:17:53.820 --> 2:17:55.300\n in your life?\n\n2:17:55.300 --> 2:17:58.040\n Or what's the flavor, the shape of your pain\n\n2:17:58.040 --> 2:17:59.000\n that fuels you?\n\n2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:02.660\n I mean, honestly, the first thing that jumped to mind\n\n2:18:02.660 --> 2:18:06.260\n is my own like battles against myself to get my work done\n\n2:18:06.260 --> 2:18:07.660\n because it affects everything.\n\n2:18:07.660 --> 2:18:09.700\n When I, I just took five years in this book\n\n2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:11.220\n and granted it's a beast.\n\n2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:13.380\n Like I probably would have taken two or three years,\n\n2:18:13.380 --> 2:18:14.480\n but it didn't need to take five.\n\n2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:16.620\n And that was a lot of, not just, you know,\n\n2:18:16.620 --> 2:18:17.860\n not just that I'm not working,\n\n2:18:17.860 --> 2:18:19.880\n it's that I'm over researching.\n\n2:18:19.880 --> 2:18:22.380\n I'm making it, I'm adding in things I shouldn't\n\n2:18:22.380 --> 2:18:23.820\n because I'm perfectionist, you know,\n\n2:18:23.820 --> 2:18:25.660\n being a perfectionist about like, oh, well I learned that.\n\n2:18:25.660 --> 2:18:26.820\n Now I want to get it in there.\n\n2:18:26.820 --> 2:18:28.020\n I know I'm going to end up cutting it later.\n\n2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:30.940\n Just, you know, or I over outline, you know,\n\n2:18:30.940 --> 2:18:32.660\n something until, you know, trying to get it perfect\n\n2:18:32.660 --> 2:18:33.940\n when I know that's not possible.\n\n2:18:33.940 --> 2:18:36.660\n So making a lot of immature kind of,\n\n2:18:36.660 --> 2:18:38.780\n like, I'm not actually that much of a writing amateur.\n\n2:18:38.780 --> 2:18:40.660\n I've written, including my old blog,\n\n2:18:40.660 --> 2:18:42.260\n I've been a writer for 15 years.\n\n2:18:42.260 --> 2:18:43.260\n I know what I'm doing.\n\n2:18:43.260 --> 2:18:45.900\n I could advise other writers really well.\n\n2:18:45.900 --> 2:18:47.900\n And yet I do a bunch of amateur things\n\n2:18:47.900 --> 2:18:50.260\n that I know while I'm doing them is an,\n\n2:18:50.260 --> 2:18:51.220\n I know I'm being an amateur.\n\n2:18:51.220 --> 2:18:55.580\n So that A, it hurts the actual product.\n\n2:18:55.580 --> 2:18:59.340\n It makes, you know, B, it's waste your precious time.\n\n2:18:59.340 --> 2:19:01.780\n C, when you're mad at yourself,\n\n2:19:01.780 --> 2:19:04.780\n when you're in a negative, you know,\n\n2:19:04.780 --> 2:19:08.140\n self defeating spiral, it almost inevitably will,\n\n2:19:08.140 --> 2:19:09.980\n you'll be less good to others.\n\n2:19:09.980 --> 2:19:12.260\n Like, you know, I'll just, just, I used to, you know,\n\n2:19:12.260 --> 2:19:15.620\n early on in my now marriage,\n\n2:19:15.620 --> 2:19:17.220\n one of the things we always used to do\n\n2:19:17.220 --> 2:19:18.980\n is I used to plan mystery dates.\n\n2:19:18.980 --> 2:19:20.820\n You know, New York city, great, great place for this.\n\n2:19:20.820 --> 2:19:22.980\n I'd find some weird little adventure for us.\n\n2:19:22.980 --> 2:19:24.700\n You know, it could be anything.\n\n2:19:24.700 --> 2:19:25.700\n And I wouldn't tell her what it was.\n\n2:19:25.700 --> 2:19:27.500\n I said, I reserving you for Thursday night,\n\n2:19:27.500 --> 2:19:29.060\n you know, at seven, okay?\n\n2:19:29.060 --> 2:19:31.420\n And it was such a fun part of our relationship.\n\n2:19:31.420 --> 2:19:33.860\n Started writing this book and got into a really bad,\n\n2:19:33.860 --> 2:19:36.380\n you know, personal space where I was like, in my head,\n\n2:19:36.380 --> 2:19:38.220\n I was like, I can't do anything until this is done.\n\n2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:39.100\n You know, like, no.\n\n2:19:39.100 --> 2:19:41.620\n And I just stopped like ever valuing,\n\n2:19:41.620 --> 2:19:44.220\n like, like joy of any kind.\n\n2:19:44.220 --> 2:19:47.140\n Like I was like, no, any, no, that's when I'm done.\n\n2:19:47.140 --> 2:19:49.900\n And that's a trap or very quickly, you know,\n\n2:19:49.900 --> 2:19:50.740\n cause I always think, you know,\n\n2:19:50.740 --> 2:19:51.940\n I think it's going to be a six months away,\n\n2:19:51.940 --> 2:19:53.780\n but actually five years later, I'm like, wow,\n\n2:19:53.780 --> 2:19:55.780\n I really wasn't living fully.\n\n2:19:55.780 --> 2:19:58.260\n And for five years is not, we don't live very long.\n\n2:19:58.260 --> 2:19:59.820\n Like talking about your prime decades,\n\n2:19:59.820 --> 2:20:01.780\n like that's like a sixth of my prime years.\n\n2:20:01.780 --> 2:20:04.860\n Like, wow, like that's a huge loss.\n\n2:20:04.860 --> 2:20:06.260\n So to me, that was excruciating.\n\n2:20:06.260 --> 2:20:10.020\n And, you know, and it was a bad pattern,\n\n2:20:10.020 --> 2:20:12.980\n a very unproductive, unhelpful pattern for me,\n\n2:20:12.980 --> 2:20:15.540\n which is I'd wake up in the morning in this great mood,\n\n2:20:15.540 --> 2:20:18.100\n great mood every morning, wake up thrilled to be awake.\n\n2:20:18.100 --> 2:20:19.380\n I have the whole day ahead of me.\n\n2:20:19.380 --> 2:20:21.180\n I'm going to get so much work done today.\n\n2:20:21.180 --> 2:20:23.580\n And, but you know, first I'm going to do all these other\n\n2:20:23.580 --> 2:20:24.620\n things and it's all going to be great.\n\n2:20:24.620 --> 2:20:27.860\n And then I ended up kind of failing for the day\n\n2:20:27.860 --> 2:20:30.260\n with those goals, sometimes miserably,\n\n2:20:30.260 --> 2:20:31.900\n sometimes only partially.\n\n2:20:31.900 --> 2:20:35.300\n And then I get in bed probably a couple hours later\n\n2:20:35.300 --> 2:20:36.140\n than I want to.\n\n2:20:36.140 --> 2:20:39.020\n And that's when all of the real reality hits me.\n\n2:20:39.020 --> 2:20:42.020\n Suddenly so much regret, so much anxiety,\n\n2:20:42.020 --> 2:20:44.700\n furious at myself, wishing I could take a time machine back\n\n2:20:44.700 --> 2:20:46.700\n three months, six months a year,\n\n2:20:46.700 --> 2:20:48.980\n or just even to the beginning of that day.\n\n2:20:48.980 --> 2:20:51.900\n And just tossing and turning now.\n\n2:20:51.900 --> 2:20:53.140\n I mean, this is a very bad place.\n\n2:20:53.140 --> 2:20:54.260\n This is what I said, suffering,\n\n2:20:54.260 --> 2:20:56.740\n procrastinators suffer in a very serious way.\n\n2:20:56.740 --> 2:20:58.300\n So look, I, you know,\n\n2:20:58.300 --> 2:21:01.260\n I know this probably sounds like a lot of like first world\n\n2:21:01.260 --> 2:21:03.540\n problems and it is, but it's real suffering as well.\n\n2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:06.900\n Like it's, so to me, it's like,\n\n2:21:06.900 --> 2:21:11.500\n it's painful because you're not being,\n\n2:21:11.500 --> 2:21:13.740\n you're not being as good a friend or a spouse or whatever,\n\n2:21:13.740 --> 2:21:14.580\n as you could be.\n\n2:21:14.580 --> 2:21:16.060\n You're also not treating yourself very well.\n\n2:21:16.060 --> 2:21:17.900\n You're usually not being very healthy in these moments.\n\n2:21:17.900 --> 2:21:20.300\n You know, you're often, and you're not being,\n\n2:21:20.300 --> 2:21:21.420\n I'm not being good to my readers.\n\n2:21:21.420 --> 2:21:22.940\n So it's just a lot of this.\n\n2:21:22.940 --> 2:21:27.260\n And it's like, it feels like it's one small tweak away.\n\n2:21:27.260 --> 2:21:28.580\n Sometimes it's like, that's what I said.\n\n2:21:28.580 --> 2:21:31.180\n It's like, you just suddenly are just doing that nine to 12\n\n2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:32.260\n and you get in that habit.\n\n2:21:32.260 --> 2:21:33.660\n Everything else falls into place.\n\n2:21:33.660 --> 2:21:35.380\n All of this reverses.\n\n2:21:35.380 --> 2:21:39.020\n So I feel hopeful, but it's like, it is a,\n\n2:21:39.020 --> 2:21:41.180\n I have not figured, I haven't fixed the boat yet.\n\n2:21:41.180 --> 2:21:43.380\n I have some good duct tape though.\n\n2:21:43.380 --> 2:21:45.420\n And you also don't want to romanticize it\n\n2:21:45.420 --> 2:21:48.420\n because it is true that some of the greats in history,\n\n2:21:48.420 --> 2:21:51.220\n especially writers suffer from all the same stuff.\n\n2:21:51.220 --> 2:21:52.780\n Like they weren't quite able.\n\n2:21:52.780 --> 2:21:56.620\n I mean, you might only write for two or three hours a day,\n\n2:21:56.620 --> 2:22:00.620\n but the rest of the day is often spent kind of tortured.\n\n2:22:00.620 --> 2:22:01.460\n Well, right.\n\n2:22:01.460 --> 2:22:03.500\n This is the irrational thing is if I,\n\n2:22:03.500 --> 2:22:05.060\n and this goes for a lot of people's jobs,\n\n2:22:05.060 --> 2:22:07.180\n people especially who work for themselves,\n\n2:22:07.180 --> 2:22:10.220\n you'd be shocked how much you could wake up at nine\n\n2:22:10.220 --> 2:22:11.980\n or eight or seven or whatever.\n\n2:22:11.980 --> 2:22:13.340\n Get to work and stop at one,\n\n2:22:13.340 --> 2:22:15.420\n but you're really focused in those hours.\n\n2:22:15.420 --> 2:22:20.060\n One or two and do 25 really focused hours of stuff,\n\n2:22:20.060 --> 2:22:23.420\n product stuff a week, and then there's 112 waking hours\n\n2:22:23.420 --> 2:22:24.260\n in the week, right?\n\n2:22:24.260 --> 2:22:27.180\n So we're talking about 80 something hours of free time.\n\n2:22:27.180 --> 2:22:29.500\n You can live, you know, if you're just really focused\n\n2:22:29.500 --> 2:22:31.380\n in your, you know, yin and yang of your time,\n\n2:22:31.380 --> 2:22:34.100\n and that's what, that's my goal is black and white time.\n\n2:22:34.100 --> 2:22:37.260\n I really focused time and then totally like\n\n2:22:37.260 --> 2:22:39.420\n clean conscience free time.\n\n2:22:39.420 --> 2:22:40.740\n Right now I have neither, it's a lot of gray.\n\n2:22:40.740 --> 2:22:42.380\n It's a lot of, I should be working, but I'm not.\n\n2:22:42.380 --> 2:22:43.660\n Oh, I'm wasting this time.\n\n2:22:43.660 --> 2:22:44.500\n This is bad.\n\n2:22:44.500 --> 2:22:45.580\n And that's just as massive.\n\n2:22:45.580 --> 2:22:49.060\n So if you can just get really good at the black\n\n2:22:49.060 --> 2:22:50.340\n and the white, so you just wake up\n\n2:22:50.340 --> 2:22:51.580\n and it's just like full work.\n\n2:22:51.580 --> 2:22:53.420\n And then I think a lot of people could have\n\n2:22:53.420 --> 2:22:54.260\n like all this free time,\n\n2:22:54.260 --> 2:22:55.860\n but instead I'll do those same three hours.\n\n2:22:55.860 --> 2:22:57.660\n It's like you said, I'll do them really late at night\n\n2:22:57.660 --> 2:23:00.100\n or whatever after having tortured myself the whole day\n\n2:23:00.100 --> 2:23:01.020\n and not had any fun.\n\n2:23:01.020 --> 2:23:03.100\n It's not like I'm having fun.\n\n2:23:03.100 --> 2:23:04.580\n I call it the dark playground, by the way,\n\n2:23:04.580 --> 2:23:06.820\n which is where you are when you know you should be working,\n\n2:23:06.820 --> 2:23:08.660\n but you're doing something else.\n\n2:23:08.660 --> 2:23:10.740\n You're doing something fun on paper,\n\n2:23:10.740 --> 2:23:12.700\n but it's never, it feels awful.\n\n2:23:12.700 --> 2:23:14.580\n And so, yeah, I spend a lot of time in the dark.\n\n2:23:14.580 --> 2:23:16.020\n And you know you shouldn't be doing it\n\n2:23:16.020 --> 2:23:18.060\n and you still do it and yeah.\n\n2:23:18.060 --> 2:23:19.380\n It's not clean conscience fun.\n\n2:23:19.380 --> 2:23:21.300\n It's bad, it's toxic.\n\n2:23:21.300 --> 2:23:23.740\n And I think that it's, there's something about,\n\n2:23:23.740 --> 2:23:25.380\n you know, you're draining yourself all the time.\n\n2:23:25.380 --> 2:23:26.780\n And if you just did your focused hours\n\n2:23:26.780 --> 2:23:28.740\n and then if you actually have good, clean fun,\n\n2:23:28.740 --> 2:23:29.580\n fun can be anything.\n\n2:23:29.580 --> 2:23:31.420\n Reading a book can be hanging out with someone\n\n2:23:31.420 --> 2:23:32.260\n who can be really fun.\n\n2:23:32.260 --> 2:23:33.860\n You can go and do something cool in the city.\n\n2:23:33.860 --> 2:23:37.020\n You know, that is critical.\n\n2:23:37.020 --> 2:23:39.020\n You're recharging some part of your psyche there.\n\n2:23:39.020 --> 2:23:39.940\n And I think it makes it easier\n\n2:23:39.940 --> 2:23:40.940\n to actually work the next day.\n\n2:23:40.940 --> 2:23:42.460\n And I say this from the experiences\n\n2:23:42.460 --> 2:23:44.260\n when I have had good stretches.\n\n2:23:44.260 --> 2:23:46.660\n It's like, you know what it is?\n\n2:23:46.660 --> 2:23:48.380\n It's like, you feel like you're fist pounding.\n\n2:23:48.380 --> 2:23:50.340\n One part of your brain is fist pounding the other part.\n\n2:23:50.340 --> 2:23:52.540\n Like, you're like, we got this.\n\n2:23:52.540 --> 2:23:54.820\n Like, we treat ourselves well.\n\n2:23:54.820 --> 2:23:56.060\n Like, this is how you internally feel.\n\n2:23:56.060 --> 2:23:56.980\n Like, I treat myself.\n\n2:23:56.980 --> 2:23:58.380\n And it's like, yeah, no, it's work time.\n\n2:23:58.380 --> 2:23:59.820\n And then later you're like, now it's play time.\n\n2:23:59.820 --> 2:24:00.980\n And it's like, okay, back to work.\n\n2:24:00.980 --> 2:24:02.180\n And you're in this very healthy,\n\n2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:04.100\n like parent child relationship in your head\n\n2:24:04.100 --> 2:24:06.940\n versus like this constant conflict.\n\n2:24:06.940 --> 2:24:08.660\n And like the kid doesn't respect the parent\n\n2:24:08.660 --> 2:24:09.500\n and the parent hates the kid.\n\n2:24:09.500 --> 2:24:10.980\n And like, yeah.\n\n2:24:10.980 --> 2:24:11.820\n And you're right.\n\n2:24:11.820 --> 2:24:14.540\n It always feels like it's like one fix away.\n\n2:24:14.540 --> 2:24:15.860\n So that there's hope.\n\n2:24:15.860 --> 2:24:18.580\n I mean, I guess, I mean,\n\n2:24:18.580 --> 2:24:21.660\n so much of what you said just rings so true.\n\n2:24:21.660 --> 2:24:24.180\n I guess I have the same kind of hope.\n\n2:24:24.180 --> 2:24:27.660\n But you know, this podcast is very regular.\n\n2:24:27.660 --> 2:24:29.060\n I mean, I'm impressed.\n\n2:24:29.060 --> 2:24:32.420\n Like, and I think partially what,\n\n2:24:32.420 --> 2:24:34.340\n there is a bit of a duct tape solution here,\n\n2:24:34.340 --> 2:24:36.380\n which is you just, the,\n\n2:24:36.380 --> 2:24:37.700\n cause it's always easy to schedule stuff\n\n2:24:37.700 --> 2:24:39.060\n for the future for myself, right?\n\n2:24:39.060 --> 2:24:40.020\n Because that's future Tim\n\n2:24:40.020 --> 2:24:42.460\n and future Tim is not my problem.\n\n2:24:42.460 --> 2:24:44.740\n So I'll schedule all kinds of shit for future Tim.\n\n2:24:44.740 --> 2:24:48.300\n And I will then not do it.\n\n2:24:48.300 --> 2:24:49.220\n But in this case,\n\n2:24:49.220 --> 2:24:52.940\n you can schedule podcasts and you have to show up.\n\n2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:53.780\n Yeah, you have to show up.\n\n2:24:53.780 --> 2:24:55.740\n Right, it seems like a good medium for procrastinating.\n\n2:24:55.740 --> 2:24:57.940\n This is not my, this is what I do for fun.\n\n2:24:57.940 --> 2:25:00.460\n I know, but at least this is the kind of thing,\n\n2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:02.500\n especially if it's not your main thing.\n\n2:25:02.500 --> 2:25:03.460\n Especially if it's not your main thing,\n\n2:25:03.460 --> 2:25:05.020\n it's the kind of thing that you would dream of doing\n\n2:25:05.020 --> 2:25:06.380\n and want to do and never do.\n\n2:25:06.380 --> 2:25:10.020\n And I feel like your regular production here\n\n2:25:10.020 --> 2:25:12.140\n is a sign that something is working,\n\n2:25:12.140 --> 2:25:13.300\n at least in this regard.\n\n2:25:13.300 --> 2:25:14.140\n Yeah, in this regard.\n\n2:25:14.140 --> 2:25:16.380\n I'm just, I'm sure you have this same kind of thing\n\n2:25:16.380 --> 2:25:17.220\n with the podcast.\n\n2:25:17.220 --> 2:25:18.980\n In fact, because you're going to be doing the podcast,\n\n2:25:18.980 --> 2:25:22.660\n as possible, the podcast becomes what the podcast is for me.\n\n2:25:22.660 --> 2:25:24.380\n This is you procrastinating.\n\n2:25:24.380 --> 2:25:25.660\n If you think about being 80\n\n2:25:25.660 --> 2:25:27.380\n and if you can get into that person's head\n\n2:25:27.380 --> 2:25:29.700\n and look back and be like, and just deep regret,\n\n2:25:29.700 --> 2:25:31.460\n you just, you know, yearning,\n\n2:25:31.460 --> 2:25:33.220\n you could do anything to just go back\n\n2:25:33.220 --> 2:25:34.660\n and have done this differently.\n\n2:25:34.660 --> 2:25:36.060\n That is desperation.\n\n2:25:36.060 --> 2:25:37.100\n It's just, you don't feel it yet.\n\n2:25:37.100 --> 2:25:38.700\n It's not in you yet.\n\n2:25:38.700 --> 2:25:40.260\n The other thing you could do is if you have a partner,\n\n2:25:40.260 --> 2:25:41.300\n if you want to partner with someone,\n\n2:25:41.300 --> 2:25:43.380\n now you could say, we meet.\n\n2:25:43.380 --> 2:25:44.980\n These 15 hours every week.\n\n2:25:44.980 --> 2:25:46.380\n And that point you're going to get it done.\n\n2:25:46.380 --> 2:25:48.900\n So working with someone can help.\n\n2:25:48.900 --> 2:25:51.220\n Yeah, that's why they say like a co founder\n\n2:25:51.220 --> 2:25:52.740\n is really powerful for many reasons,\n\n2:25:52.740 --> 2:25:54.500\n but that's kind of one of them.\n\n2:25:54.500 --> 2:25:56.980\n Because to actually, for the startup case,\n\n2:25:57.900 --> 2:26:00.860\n you, unlike writing perhaps,\n\n2:26:00.860 --> 2:26:03.180\n it's really like a hundred hour plus thing.\n\n2:26:03.180 --> 2:26:06.980\n Like once you really launch, you go all in.\n\n2:26:06.980 --> 2:26:09.340\n Like everything else just disappears.\n\n2:26:09.340 --> 2:26:11.820\n Like you can't even have a hope of a balanced life\n\n2:26:11.820 --> 2:26:12.660\n for a little bit.\n\n2:26:12.660 --> 2:26:15.340\n So, and there co founder really helps.\n\n2:26:15.340 --> 2:26:16.340\n That's the idea.\n\n2:26:18.300 --> 2:26:20.900\n When you, you're one of the most interesting people\n\n2:26:20.900 --> 2:26:21.820\n on the internet.\n\n2:26:21.820 --> 2:26:26.540\n So as a writer, you look out into the future.\n\n2:26:27.540 --> 2:26:30.460\n Do you dream about certain things you want to still create?\n\n2:26:30.460 --> 2:26:34.140\n Is there projects that you want to write?\n\n2:26:34.140 --> 2:26:37.420\n Is there movies you want to write or direct or?\n\n2:26:37.420 --> 2:26:38.660\n Endless.\n\n2:26:38.660 --> 2:26:40.980\n So it's just endless sea of ideas.\n\n2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:44.140\n No, there's specific list of things that really excite me,\n\n2:26:44.140 --> 2:26:46.220\n but it's a big list that I know\n\n2:26:46.220 --> 2:26:47.340\n I'll never get through them all.\n\n2:26:47.340 --> 2:26:51.580\n And that's part of why the last five years really like,\n\n2:26:51.580 --> 2:26:54.340\n when I feel like I'm not moving as quickly as I could,\n\n2:26:54.340 --> 2:26:57.180\n it bothers me because I have so much genuine excitement\n\n2:26:57.180 --> 2:26:58.380\n to try so many different things.\n\n2:26:58.380 --> 2:27:00.180\n And I get so much joy from finishing things.\n\n2:27:00.180 --> 2:27:03.580\n I don't like doing things, but a lot of writers are like that.\n\n2:27:03.580 --> 2:27:06.580\n Publishing something is hugely joyful\n\n2:27:06.580 --> 2:27:08.140\n and makes it all worth it.\n\n2:27:08.140 --> 2:27:09.980\n Or just finishing something you're proud of,\n\n2:27:09.980 --> 2:27:11.500\n putting it out there and have people appreciate it.\n\n2:27:11.500 --> 2:27:13.700\n It's like the best thing in the world, right?\n\n2:27:13.700 --> 2:27:15.740\n Every kid makes some little bargain with themselves,\n\n2:27:15.740 --> 2:27:19.060\n has a little, a dream or something.\n\n2:27:19.060 --> 2:27:22.940\n And I feel like when I do something that I make something\n\n2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:25.740\n in this, for me, it's been mostly writing\n\n2:27:25.740 --> 2:27:27.660\n and I feel proud of it and I put it out there.\n\n2:27:27.660 --> 2:27:29.140\n I feel like I like, again,\n\n2:27:29.140 --> 2:27:30.940\n I'm like fist pounding my seven year old self.\n\n2:27:30.940 --> 2:27:34.700\n Like there's a little, like I owe it to myself\n\n2:27:34.700 --> 2:27:35.540\n to do certain things.\n\n2:27:35.540 --> 2:27:36.860\n And I just did one of the things I owe.\n\n2:27:36.860 --> 2:27:38.060\n I just paid off some debt to myself.\n\n2:27:38.060 --> 2:27:40.260\n I owed it and I paid it and it feels great.\n\n2:27:40.260 --> 2:27:42.700\n It feels like very like you just feel very,\n\n2:27:42.700 --> 2:27:43.900\n a lot of inner peace when you do it.\n\n2:27:43.900 --> 2:27:46.140\n So the more things I can do,\n\n2:27:46.140 --> 2:27:47.460\n and I just have fun doing it, right?\n\n2:27:47.460 --> 2:27:50.860\n And so I just, for me that includes a lot more writing.\n\n2:27:50.860 --> 2:27:54.460\n I just, short blog posts, I write very long blog posts,\n\n2:27:54.460 --> 2:27:55.620\n but basically short writing\n\n2:27:55.620 --> 2:27:57.940\n in the form of long blog posts is a great,\n\n2:27:57.940 --> 2:27:59.060\n I love that medium.\n\n2:27:59.060 --> 2:28:00.860\n I wanna do a lot more of that.\n\n2:28:00.860 --> 2:28:02.620\n Books yet to be seen, I'm gonna do this\n\n2:28:02.620 --> 2:28:04.100\n and I'm gonna have another book I'm gonna do right after.\n\n2:28:04.100 --> 2:28:05.340\n And we'll see if I like those two.\n\n2:28:05.340 --> 2:28:07.620\n And if I do, I'll do more, otherwise I won't.\n\n2:28:07.620 --> 2:28:08.780\n But I also wanna try other mediums.\n\n2:28:08.780 --> 2:28:10.860\n I wanna make more videos.\n\n2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:14.540\n I want to, I did a little travel series once.\n\n2:28:14.540 --> 2:28:15.380\n I love doing that.\n\n2:28:15.380 --> 2:28:16.780\n I wanna do more of that.\n\n2:28:16.780 --> 2:28:18.500\n Almost like a vlog.\n\n2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:21.260\n No, it was, I let readers in a survey\n\n2:28:22.260 --> 2:28:24.820\n pick five countries they wanted me to go to.\n\n2:28:24.820 --> 2:28:25.660\n That's awesome.\n\n2:28:25.660 --> 2:28:27.940\n And they picked, they sent me to weird places.\n\n2:28:27.940 --> 2:28:32.460\n They sent me, I went to Siberia, I went to Japan.\n\n2:28:32.460 --> 2:28:34.740\n I went from there to, this is all in a row,\n\n2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:37.380\n into Nigeria, from there to Iraq.\n\n2:28:37.380 --> 2:28:39.140\n And from there to Greenland.\n\n2:28:39.140 --> 2:28:41.020\n And then I went back to New York,\n\n2:28:41.020 --> 2:28:42.420\n like two weeks in each place.\n\n2:28:43.620 --> 2:28:46.860\n And I got to, each one I got to have some weird experiences.\n\n2:28:46.860 --> 2:28:48.420\n I tried to like really dig in\n\n2:28:48.420 --> 2:28:51.460\n and have like some interesting experiences.\n\n2:28:51.460 --> 2:28:52.540\n And then I wrote about it.\n\n2:28:52.540 --> 2:28:53.900\n And I taught readers a little bit\n\n2:28:53.900 --> 2:28:55.020\n about the history of these places.\n\n2:28:55.020 --> 2:28:56.340\n And it was just, I love doing that.\n\n2:28:56.340 --> 2:28:58.940\n I love, so, and I'm like, oh man,\n\n2:28:58.940 --> 2:29:01.820\n like I haven't done one of those in so long.\n\n2:29:01.820 --> 2:29:05.820\n And then I have a big like desire to do fictional stuff.\n\n2:29:05.820 --> 2:29:07.740\n Like I want to write a sci fi at some point.\n\n2:29:07.740 --> 2:29:09.740\n And I would love to write a musical.\n\n2:29:09.740 --> 2:29:11.780\n That's actually what I was doing before Wait But Why.\n\n2:29:11.780 --> 2:29:14.420\n I was with a partner, Ryan Langer.\n\n2:29:14.420 --> 2:29:15.860\n We were halfway through a musical\n\n2:29:15.860 --> 2:29:19.860\n and he got tied up with his other musical\n\n2:29:19.860 --> 2:29:21.420\n and Wait But Why started taking off.\n\n2:29:21.420 --> 2:29:22.740\n And we just haven't gotten back to it.\n\n2:29:22.740 --> 2:29:24.260\n But it's such a fun medium.\n\n2:29:24.260 --> 2:29:26.540\n So it's such a silly medium, but it's so fun.\n\n2:29:26.540 --> 2:29:28.460\n So you think about all of these mediums\n\n2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:30.700\n on which you can be creative and create something\n\n2:29:30.700 --> 2:29:32.620\n and you like the variety of it.\n\n2:29:32.620 --> 2:29:37.180\n Yeah, it's just that if there's a chance on a new medium,\n\n2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:38.820\n I could do something good.\n\n2:29:38.820 --> 2:29:39.660\n I want to do it.\n\n2:29:39.660 --> 2:29:40.500\n I want to try it.\n\n2:29:40.500 --> 2:29:42.900\n It sounds like so gratifying and so fun.\n\n2:29:42.900 --> 2:29:45.540\n I think it's fun to just watch you actually sample these.\n\n2:29:45.540 --> 2:29:47.740\n So I can't wait for your podcast.\n\n2:29:47.740 --> 2:29:49.460\n I'll be listening to all of them.\n\n2:29:49.460 --> 2:29:52.220\n I mean, that's a cool medium to see like where it goes.\n\n2:29:52.220 --> 2:29:54.340\n The cool thing about podcasting and making videos,\n\n2:29:54.340 --> 2:29:56.860\n especially with a super creative mind like yours,\n\n2:29:56.860 --> 2:29:59.640\n you don't really know what you're going to make of it\n\n2:29:59.640 --> 2:30:01.180\n until you try it.\n\n2:30:01.180 --> 2:30:03.020\n Yeah, podcasts I'm really excited about,\n\n2:30:03.020 --> 2:30:06.540\n but I'm like, I like going on other people's podcasts.\n\n2:30:06.540 --> 2:30:08.180\n And I never try to have my own.\n\n2:30:08.180 --> 2:30:10.000\n So with every medium,\n\n2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:13.180\n there's the challenges of how the sausage is made.\n\n2:30:13.180 --> 2:30:15.380\n So like the challenges of action.\n\n2:30:15.380 --> 2:30:16.700\n Yeah, but it's also, I like to like,\n\n2:30:16.700 --> 2:30:19.380\n I'll go on like, as you know, long ass monologues\n\n2:30:19.380 --> 2:30:20.540\n and you can't do that.\n\n2:30:20.540 --> 2:30:21.720\n If you're the interviewer,\n\n2:30:21.720 --> 2:30:23.420\n like you're not supposed to do that as much.\n\n2:30:23.420 --> 2:30:27.700\n So I have to like rein it in and that might be hard,\n\n2:30:27.700 --> 2:30:28.540\n but we'll see.\n\n2:30:28.540 --> 2:30:29.500\n You could also do solo type stuff.\n\n2:30:29.500 --> 2:30:31.180\n Yeah, maybe I'll do a little of each.\n\n2:30:31.180 --> 2:30:32.020\n You know what's funny?\n\n2:30:32.020 --> 2:30:34.140\n I mean, some of my favorite is more like solo,\n\n2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:36.060\n but there's like a sidekick.\n\n2:30:36.060 --> 2:30:40.600\n So you're having a conversation, but you're like friends,\n\n2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:43.180\n but it's really you ranting,\n\n2:30:43.180 --> 2:30:46.100\n which I think you'd be extremely good at.\n\n2:30:46.100 --> 2:30:46.940\n That's funny, yeah.\n\n2:30:46.940 --> 2:30:48.820\n Or even if it's 50 50, that's fine.\n\n2:30:48.820 --> 2:30:50.900\n Like if it's just a friend who I want to like really riff\n\n2:30:50.900 --> 2:30:55.380\n with, I just don't like interviewing someone,\n\n2:30:55.380 --> 2:30:57.200\n which I won't, that's not what the podcast will be,\n\n2:30:57.200 --> 2:30:58.040\n but I can't help.\n\n2:30:58.040 --> 2:30:59.940\n I've tried moderating panels before\n\n2:30:59.940 --> 2:31:01.020\n and I cannot help myself.\n\n2:31:01.020 --> 2:31:03.340\n I have to get involved and no one likes a moderator\n\n2:31:03.340 --> 2:31:04.180\n who's too involved.\n\n2:31:04.180 --> 2:31:05.000\n It's very unappealing.\n\n2:31:05.000 --> 2:31:07.600\n So I, you know, interviewing someone and I'm like,\n\n2:31:07.600 --> 2:31:09.980\n I can't, I don't even, I don't, I just, it's not my,\n\n2:31:09.980 --> 2:31:11.540\n I can grill someone, but that's different.\n\n2:31:11.540 --> 2:31:13.720\n That's my curiosity being like, wait, how about this?\n\n2:31:13.720 --> 2:31:14.740\n And I interrupt them and I'm trying to.\n\n2:31:14.740 --> 2:31:16.340\n I see the way your brain works.\n\n2:31:16.340 --> 2:31:17.180\n It's hilarious.\n\n2:31:17.180 --> 2:31:18.000\n It's awesome.\n\n2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:19.940\n It's like lights up with fire and excitement.\n\n2:31:19.940 --> 2:31:21.820\n Yeah, I actually, I love listening.\n\n2:31:21.820 --> 2:31:24.100\n I like watching people, I like listening to people.\n\n2:31:24.100 --> 2:31:25.700\n So this is like me right now,\n\n2:31:25.700 --> 2:31:27.900\n having just listening to a podcast.\n\n2:31:27.900 --> 2:31:29.660\n This is me listening to your podcast right now.\n\n2:31:29.660 --> 2:31:30.780\n I love listening to a podcast\n\n2:31:30.780 --> 2:31:31.820\n because then it's not even like,\n\n2:31:31.820 --> 2:31:33.980\n but once I'm in the room, I suddenly can't help myself.\n\n2:31:33.980 --> 2:31:35.380\n I jump again.\n\n2:31:35.380 --> 2:31:36.700\n Okay.\n\n2:31:36.700 --> 2:31:38.400\n Big last ridiculous question.\n\n2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:40.340\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n2:31:40.340 --> 2:31:42.380\n The meaning of like an individual life?\n\n2:31:42.380 --> 2:31:44.260\n Your existence here on earth,\n\n2:31:44.260 --> 2:31:47.200\n or maybe broadly this whole thing we've got going on,\n\n2:31:47.200 --> 2:31:48.460\n descendants of apes,\n\n2:31:49.340 --> 2:31:50.460\n busily creating.\n\n2:31:50.460 --> 2:31:51.280\n Yeah, well there's, yeah.\n\n2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:55.580\n For me, I feel like I want to be around as long as I can.\n\n2:31:55.580 --> 2:31:57.840\n If I can, if I can do some kind of crazy life extension\n\n2:31:57.840 --> 2:31:59.060\n or upload myself, I'm gonna,\n\n2:31:59.060 --> 2:32:01.180\n because who doesn't want to see how cool\n\n2:32:01.180 --> 2:32:03.240\n the year 3000 is?\n\n2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:04.080\n Imagine.\n\n2:32:04.080 --> 2:32:06.300\n You did say mortality was not appealing.\n\n2:32:06.300 --> 2:32:08.100\n No, it's not appealing at all to me.\n\n2:32:08.100 --> 2:32:10.180\n Now, it's ultimately appealing.\n\n2:32:10.180 --> 2:32:12.260\n As I said, no one wants eternal life, I believe,\n\n2:32:12.260 --> 2:32:14.180\n if they understood what eternity really was.\n\n2:32:14.180 --> 2:32:15.900\n And I did Graham's number as a post,\n\n2:32:15.900 --> 2:32:18.160\n and I was like, okay, no one wants to live that many years.\n\n2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:19.340\n But I'd like to choose.\n\n2:32:19.340 --> 2:32:20.180\n I'd like to say, you know what?\n\n2:32:20.180 --> 2:32:21.620\n I'm truly over it now, and I'm going to have,\n\n2:32:21.620 --> 2:32:22.700\n you know, at that point we'd have,\n\n2:32:22.700 --> 2:32:24.380\n our whole society would have like,\n\n2:32:24.380 --> 2:32:25.620\n we'd have a ceremony.\n\n2:32:25.620 --> 2:32:28.060\n We'd have a whole process of someone signing off,\n\n2:32:28.060 --> 2:32:29.420\n and you know, it would be beautiful,\n\n2:32:29.420 --> 2:32:30.260\n and it wouldn't be sad.\n\n2:32:30.260 --> 2:32:33.540\n Well, I think you'd be super depressed by that point.\n\n2:32:33.540 --> 2:32:35.420\n Like, who's gonna sign off when they're doing pretty good?\n\n2:32:35.420 --> 2:32:36.260\n Maybe, maybe, yes.\n\n2:32:36.260 --> 2:32:37.500\n Okay, maybe it's dark.\n\n2:32:37.500 --> 2:32:38.740\n But at least, but the point is,\n\n2:32:38.740 --> 2:32:40.940\n if I'm happy, I can stay around for five, you know.\n\n2:32:40.940 --> 2:32:42.740\n I'm thinking 50 century sounds great.\n\n2:32:42.740 --> 2:32:44.140\n Like, I don't know if I want more than that.\n\n2:32:44.140 --> 2:32:45.540\n 50 sounds like a right number.\n\n2:32:45.540 --> 2:32:47.860\n And so if you're thinking, if you would sign up for 50,\n\n2:32:47.860 --> 2:32:50.500\n if you had a choice, one is what I get, that is bullshit.\n\n2:32:50.500 --> 2:32:52.820\n Like, if you're somebody who wants 50,\n\n2:32:52.820 --> 2:32:55.500\n one is a hideous number, right?\n\n2:32:55.500 --> 2:32:56.820\n You know, anyway.\n\n2:32:56.820 --> 2:33:01.100\n So for me personally, I want to be around as long as I can.\n\n2:33:01.100 --> 2:33:02.980\n And then honestly, the reason I love writing,\n\n2:33:02.980 --> 2:33:05.260\n the thing that I love most is like,\n\n2:33:05.260 --> 2:33:08.500\n is like a warm fuzzy connection with other people, right?\n\n2:33:08.500 --> 2:33:11.780\n And that can be my friends, and it can be readers.\n\n2:33:11.780 --> 2:33:13.920\n And that's why I would never want to be like a journalist\n\n2:33:13.920 --> 2:33:16.720\n where their personality is like hidden behind the writing,\n\n2:33:17.740 --> 2:33:19.600\n or like even a biographer, you know.\n\n2:33:19.600 --> 2:33:21.240\n There's a lot of people who are great writers,\n\n2:33:21.240 --> 2:33:23.620\n but it's, I like to personally connect.\n\n2:33:23.620 --> 2:33:25.360\n And if I can take something that's in my head\n\n2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:27.040\n and other people can say, oh my God, I think that too,\n\n2:33:27.040 --> 2:33:28.380\n and this made me feel so much better,\n\n2:33:28.380 --> 2:33:30.220\n it made me feel seen, like that feels amazing.\n\n2:33:30.220 --> 2:33:33.460\n And I just feel like we're all having\n\n2:33:33.460 --> 2:33:35.940\n such a weird common experience on this one little rock,\n\n2:33:35.940 --> 2:33:37.340\n in this one little moment of time,\n\n2:33:37.340 --> 2:33:40.880\n where this weird, these weird four limb beings,\n\n2:33:40.880 --> 2:33:41.720\n and we're all the same.\n\n2:33:41.720 --> 2:33:43.860\n And it's like, we're all, we all, the human experience,\n\n2:33:43.860 --> 2:33:46.180\n so I feel like so many of us suffer in the same ways,\n\n2:33:46.180 --> 2:33:48.040\n and we're all going through a lot of the same things.\n\n2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:50.420\n And to me, it is very, if I lived,\n\n2:33:50.420 --> 2:33:52.160\n if I was on my deathbed and I feel like I had,\n\n2:33:52.160 --> 2:33:54.580\n like I had a ton of human connection,\n\n2:33:54.580 --> 2:33:56.500\n and like shared a lot of common experience,\n\n2:33:56.500 --> 2:33:58.500\n and made a lot of other people feel like,\n\n2:33:59.700 --> 2:34:01.460\n like not alone.\n\n2:34:01.460 --> 2:34:02.780\n Do you feel that as a writer?\n\n2:34:02.780 --> 2:34:07.780\n Do you like hear and feel like the inspiration,\n\n2:34:08.060 --> 2:34:10.460\n like all the people that you make smile,\n\n2:34:10.460 --> 2:34:11.380\n and all the people you inspire?\n\n2:34:11.380 --> 2:34:13.500\n Honestly, not, sometimes, you know,\n\n2:34:13.500 --> 2:34:14.940\n when we did an in person event,\n\n2:34:14.940 --> 2:34:16.260\n and I, you know, meet a bunch of people,\n\n2:34:16.260 --> 2:34:18.140\n and it's incredibly gratifying,\n\n2:34:18.140 --> 2:34:19.620\n or, you know, you just, you know, you get emails,\n\n2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:22.300\n but I think it is easy to forget that how many people,\n\n2:34:22.300 --> 2:34:24.220\n sometimes you're just sitting there alone,\n\n2:34:24.220 --> 2:34:26.900\n typing, dealing with your procrastination.\n\n2:34:26.900 --> 2:34:28.220\n But that's why publishing is so gratifying,\n\n2:34:28.220 --> 2:34:30.280\n because that's the moment when all this connection happens.\n\n2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:32.220\n And especially if I had to put my finger on it,\n\n2:34:32.220 --> 2:34:35.460\n it's like, it's having a bunch of people who feel lonely,\n\n2:34:35.460 --> 2:34:37.060\n and their like existence is all realized,\n\n2:34:37.060 --> 2:34:38.500\n like all, you know, connect, right?\n\n2:34:38.500 --> 2:34:40.220\n So that, if I do a lot of that,\n\n2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:43.060\n and that includes, of course, my actual spending,\n\n2:34:43.060 --> 2:34:44.520\n you know, a lot of really high quality time\n\n2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:46.220\n with friends and family, and like,\n\n2:34:47.940 --> 2:34:50.140\n and making the whole thing as heartbreaking\n\n2:34:50.140 --> 2:34:51.900\n as like mortality and life can be,\n\n2:34:51.900 --> 2:34:53.420\n make the whole thing like fun,\n\n2:34:53.420 --> 2:34:55.700\n and at least we can like laugh at ourselves together\n\n2:34:55.700 --> 2:34:56.940\n while going through it.\n\n2:34:56.940 --> 2:34:58.500\n And that to me is the, yeah.\n\n2:34:58.500 --> 2:35:02.620\n And then your last blog post will be written from Mars\n\n2:35:02.620 --> 2:35:05.460\n as you get the bad news that you're not able to return\n\n2:35:05.460 --> 2:35:07.740\n because of the malfunction in the rocket.\n\n2:35:07.740 --> 2:35:09.180\n Yeah, I would like to go to Mars,\n\n2:35:09.180 --> 2:35:10.140\n and like go there for a week,\n\n2:35:10.140 --> 2:35:11.960\n and be like, yeah, here we are, and then come back.\n\n2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:13.540\n No, I know that's what you want.\n\n2:35:13.540 --> 2:35:14.820\n Staying there, yeah.\n\n2:35:14.820 --> 2:35:15.740\n And that's fine, by the way.\n\n2:35:15.740 --> 2:35:17.780\n If I, yeah, if, so you think,\n\n2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:20.760\n you're picturing me alone on Mars as the first person there,\n\n2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:21.600\n and then it malfunctions.\n\n2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:23.200\n Right, no, you were supposed to return,\n\n2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:26.300\n but it malfunctions, and then there's this,\n\n2:35:26.300 --> 2:35:30.540\n so it's both the hope, the awe that you experience,\n\n2:35:30.540 --> 2:35:32.420\n which is how the blog starts,\n\n2:35:32.420 --> 2:35:34.980\n and then it's the overwhelming,\n\n2:35:34.980 --> 2:35:38.060\n like feeling of existential dread,\n\n2:35:38.060 --> 2:35:41.220\n but then it returns to like the love of humanity.\n\n2:35:41.220 --> 2:35:43.780\n Well, that's the thing, is if I could be writing,\n\n2:35:43.780 --> 2:35:44.880\n and actually like writing something\n\n2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:46.060\n that people would read back on Earth,\n\n2:35:46.060 --> 2:35:47.300\n it would make it feel so much better.\n\n2:35:47.300 --> 2:35:48.120\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:48.960\n You know, if I were just alone,\n\n2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:50.620\n and no one was gonna realize what happened.\n\n2:35:50.620 --> 2:35:51.620\n No, no, no, you get to write.\n\n2:35:51.620 --> 2:35:53.180\n Yeah, no, no, it's perfectly safe.\n\n2:35:53.180 --> 2:35:54.940\n Also, that would bring out great writing.\n\n2:35:54.940 --> 2:35:55.780\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n2:35:55.780 --> 2:35:56.940\n If you don't have your deathbed on Mars alone.\n\n2:35:56.940 --> 2:35:57.780\n I think so.\n\n2:35:57.780 --> 2:35:58.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:02.780\n Well, that's exactly the future I hope for you, Tim.\n\n2:36:02.780 --> 2:36:04.500\n All right, this was an incredible conversation.\n\n2:36:04.500 --> 2:36:06.580\n You're a really special human being, Tim.\n\n2:36:06.580 --> 2:36:08.980\n Thank you so much for spending\n\n2:36:08.980 --> 2:36:10.140\n your really valuable time with me.\n\n2:36:10.140 --> 2:36:11.900\n I can't wait to hear your podcast.\n\n2:36:11.900 --> 2:36:15.280\n I can't wait to read your next blog post,\n\n2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:17.220\n which you said in a Twitter reply.\n\n2:36:17.220 --> 2:36:19.460\n You'll get more.\n\n2:36:19.460 --> 2:36:20.940\n Yeah, soon enough, I'll be back.\n\n2:36:20.940 --> 2:36:24.580\n After the book, which add that to the long list of ideas\n\n2:36:24.580 --> 2:36:26.700\n to procrastinate about.\n\n2:36:26.700 --> 2:36:28.700\n Tim, thanks so much for talking to me, man.\n\n2:36:28.700 --> 2:36:29.540\n Thank you.\n\n2:36:30.820 --> 2:36:33.620\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tim Urban.\n\n2:36:33.620 --> 2:36:34.980\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:36:34.980 --> 2:36:37.820\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:36:37.820 --> 2:36:39.860\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:36:39.860 --> 2:36:41.400\n from Tim Urban himself.\n\n2:36:42.380 --> 2:36:44.980\n Be humbler about what you know,\n\n2:36:44.980 --> 2:36:47.460\n more confident about what's possible,\n\n2:36:47.460 --> 2:36:51.140\n and less afraid of things that don't matter.\n\n2:36:51.140 --> 2:37:18.140\n Thanks for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
