00:10.360\n Leaders Eat Last, and his latest, The Infinite Game.\n\n00:11.220 --> 00:12.780\n He's one of the best communicators\n\n00:12.780 --> 00:14.700\n of what it takes to be a good leader,\n\n00:14.700 --> 00:16.900\n to inspire, and to build businesses\n\n00:16.900 --> 00:19.420\n that solve big, difficult challenges.\n\n00:21.060 --> 00:23.700\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:23.700 --> 00:25.940\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:25.940 --> 00:28.280\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n00:28.280 --> 00:31.600\n support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,\n\n00:31.600 --> 00:35.780\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n00:35.780 --> 00:38.360\n As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now,\n\n00:38.360 --> 00:39.740\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n00:39.740 --> 00:42.200\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n00:42.200 --> 00:43.640\n I hope that works for you,\n\n00:43.640 --> 00:45.920\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n00:46.880 --> 00:48.580\n Quick summary of the ads.\n\n00:48.580 --> 00:52.540\n Two sponsors, Cash App and Masterclass.\n\n00:52.540 --> 00:54.280\n Please consider supporting the podcast\n\n00:54.280 --> 00:57.880\n by downloading Cash App and using code LexPodcast,\n\n00:57.880 --> 01:02.880\n and signing up to Masterclass at Masterclass.com slash Lex.\n\n01:04.400 --> 01:06.660\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:06.660 --> 01:09.500\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:09.500 --> 01:13.300\n When you get it, use code LexPodcast.\n\n01:13.300 --> 01:15.340\n Cash App lets you send money to friends,\n\n01:15.340 --> 01:17.860\n buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market\n\n01:17.860 --> 01:20.780\n with as little as one dollar.\n\n01:20.780 --> 01:23.020\n Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,\n\n01:23.020 --> 01:25.100\n let me mention that cryptocurrency,\n\n01:25.100 --> 01:28.620\n in the context of the history of money, is fascinating.\n\n01:28.620 --> 01:32.540\n I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.\n\n01:32.540 --> 01:37.540\n Debits and credits on Ledger started around 30,000 years ago.\n\n01:37.700 --> 01:40.540\n The US dollar created over 200 years ago,\n\n01:40.540 --> 01:43.940\n and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,\n\n01:43.940 --> 01:46.340\n released just over 10 years ago.\n\n01:46.340 --> 01:50.220\n So given that history, cryptocurrency's still very much\n\n01:50.220 --> 01:52.140\n in its early days of development,\n\n01:52.140 --> 01:55.300\n but it's still aiming to, and just might,\n\n01:55.300 --> 01:57.560\n redefine the nature of money.\n\n01:58.420 --> 02:00.820\n So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store\n\n02:00.820 --> 02:04.440\n or Google Play, and use the code LexPodcast,\n\n02:04.440 --> 02:08.460\n you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 the first,\n\n02:08.460 --> 02:11.100\n an organization that is helping to advance robotics\n\n02:11.100 --> 02:14.820\n and STEM education for young people around the world.\n\n02:14.820 --> 02:17.200\n This show is sponsored by Masterclass.\n\n02:17.200 --> 02:21.540\n Sign up at Masterclass.com slash Lex to get a discount\n\n02:21.540 --> 02:24.060\n and to

$180 a year, you get an all access pass\n\n02:32.620 --> 02:36.680\n to watch courses from experts at the top of their field.\n\n02:36.680 --> 02:38.580\n To list some of my favorites,\n\n02:38.580 --> 02:41.200\n Chris Hatfield on Space Exploration,\n\n02:41.200 --> 02:43.260\n Neil deGrasse Tyson on Scientific Thinking\n\n02:43.260 --> 02:47.620\n and Communication, Will Wright, the creator of SimCity,\n\n02:47.620 --> 02:50.260\n and Sims on Game Design.\n\n02:50.260 --> 02:51.860\n I love that game.\n\n02:51.860 --> 02:54.860\n Jane Goodall on Conservation, Carlos Santana,\n\n02:54.860 --> 02:57.400\n one of my favorite guitarists on guitar,\n\n02:57.400 --> 03:01.240\n Gary Kasparov on Chess, obviously I'm Russian,\n\n03:01.240 --> 03:04.300\n I love Gary, Daniel Negrano on Poker,\n\n03:04.300 --> 03:05.820\n one of my favorite poker players,\n\n03:05.820 --> 03:09.420\n also Phil Ivey gives a course as well,\n\n03:09.420 --> 03:11.320\n and many, many more.\n\n03:11.320 --> 03:14.020\n Chris Hatfield explaining how rockets work\n\n03:14.020 --> 03:17.200\n and the experience of being launched into space alone\n\n03:17.200 --> 03:18.900\n is worth the money.\n\n03:18.900 --> 03:21.980\n By way of advice, for me, the key is not to be overwhelmed\n\n03:21.980 --> 03:24.180\n by the abundance of choice.\n\n03:24.180 --> 03:26.180\n Pick three courses you want to complete,\n\n03:26.180 --> 03:28.580\n watch each all the way through from start to finish,\n\n03:28.580 --> 03:30.780\n it's not that long, but it's an experience\n\n03:30.780 --> 03:33.940\n that will stick with you for a long time, I promise.\n\n03:33.940 --> 03:35.460\n It's easily worth the money,\n\n03:35.460 --> 03:38.040\n you can watch it on basically any device.\n\n03:38.040 --> 03:42.060\n Once again, sign up at masterclass.com slash Lex\n\n03:42.060 --> 03:45.740\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n03:45.740 --> 03:49.440\n And now, here's my conversation with Simon Sinek.\n\n03:50.340 --> 03:53.140\n In the Infinite Game, your most recent book,\n\n03:53.140 --> 03:56.060\n you describe the finite game and the infinite game,\n\n03:56.060 --> 03:58.660\n so from my perspective of artificial intelligence\n\n03:58.660 --> 04:03.660\n and game theory in general, I'm a huge fan of finite games\n\n04:03.860 --> 04:05.220\n from the broad philosophical sense,\n\n04:05.220 --> 04:07.620\n it's something that in the robotics,\n\n04:07.620 --> 04:09.620\n artificial intelligence space, we know how to deal with,\n\n04:09.620 --> 04:11.700\n and then you describe the infinite game,\n\n04:11.700 --> 04:13.940\n which has no exact static rules,\n\n04:13.940 --> 04:17.340\n has no well defined static objective,\n\n04:17.340 --> 04:19.740\n the players are known, unknown, they change,\n\n04:19.740 --> 04:21.420\n there's the dynamic element,\n\n04:21.420 --> 04:26.260\n so this is something that applies to business, politics,\n\n04:26.260 --> 04:30.180\n life itself, so can you try to articulate\n\n04:30.180 --> 04:33.960\n the objective function here of the infinite game,\n\n04:33.960 --> 04:38.960\n or in the cliche, broad philosophical sense,\n\n04:39.180 --> 04:41.600\n what is the meaning of life?\n\n04:41.600 --> 04:44.960\n Go for the, start with a softball.\n\n04:44.960 --> 04:46.600\n Yep, easy question first.\n\n04:48.440 --> 04:50.800\n So James Kars was the philosopher\n\n04:50.800 --> 04:52.320\n who originally articulated this concept\n\n04:52.320 --> 04:54.080\n of finite and infinite games,\n\n04:54.080 --> 04:56.240\n and when I learned about it,\n\n04:56.240 --> 05:00.060\n it really challenged my view of how the world works, right?\n\n05:00.060 --> 05:02.580\n Because I think we all think about winning\n\n05:02.580 --> 05:04.040\n and being the best and being number one,\n\n05:04.040 --> 05:05.400\n but if you think about it,\n\n05:06.440 --> 05:07.920\n only in a finite game can that exist,\n\n05:07.920 --> 05:11.920\n a game that has fixed rules, agreed upon objectives,\n\n05:11.920 --> 05:14.000\n and known players, like football or baseball,\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:15.360\n there's always a beginning, middle, and end,\n\n05:15.360 --> 05:17.120\n and if there's a winner, there has to be a loser.\n\n05:17.120 --> 05:20.680\n Infinite games, as Kars describes them,\n\n05:20.680 --> 05:22.940\n as you said, have known and unknown players,\n\n05:22.940 --> 05:24.640\n which means anyone can join,\n\n05:24.640 --> 05:26.220\n it has changeable rules,\n\n05:26.220 --> 05:27.840\n which means you can play however you want,\n\n05:27.840 --> 05:29.460\n and the objective is to perpetuate the game,\n\n05:29.460 --> 05:32.200\n to stay in the game as long as possible.\n\n05:32.200 --> 05:33.140\n In other words, there's no such thing\n\n05:33.140 --> 05:34.440\n as being number one or winning\n\n05:34.440 --> 05:36.680\n in a game that has no finish line.\n\n05:36.680 --> 05:40.680\n And what I learned is that when we try to win\n\n05:40.680 --> 05:42.820\n in a game that has no finish line,\n\n05:42.820 --> 05:44.840\n we try to be number, we try to be the best\n\n05:44.840 --> 05:46.640\n in a game that has no agreed upon objectives\n\n05:46.640 --> 05:49.320\n or agreed upon metrics or timeframes,\n\n05:49.320 --> 05:51.840\n there's a few consistent and predictable outcomes,\n\n05:51.840 --> 05:54.400\n the decline of trust, the decline of cooperation,\n\n05:54.400 --> 05:55.680\n the decline of innovation.\n\n05:57.120 --> 06:01.040\n And I find this fascinating because so many of the ways\n\n06:01.040 --> 06:04.040\n that we run most organizations is with a finite mindset.\n\n06:04.040 --> 06:06.920\n So trying to reduce the beautiful complex thing\n\n06:06.920 --> 06:09.600\n that is life or whatever, politics or business,\n\n06:09.600 --> 06:12.040\n into something very narrow,\n\n06:12.040 --> 06:14.840\n and in that process, the reductionist process,\n\n06:14.840 --> 06:16.240\n you lose something fundamental\n\n06:16.240 --> 06:20.240\n that makes the whole thing work in the long term.\n\n06:20.240 --> 06:24.640\n So returning, not gonna let you off the hook easy,\n\n06:24.640 --> 06:26.920\n what is the meaning of life?\n\n06:26.920 --> 06:28.460\n So what is the objective function\n\n06:28.460 --> 06:31.040\n that is worthwhile to pursue?\n\n06:31.040 --> 06:34.080\n Well, if you think about our tombstones, right?\n\n06:34.080 --> 06:36.480\n They have the date we were born and the date we died,\n\n06:36.480 --> 06:39.920\n but really it's what we do with the gap in between.\n\n06:39.920 --> 06:41.860\n There's a poem called The Dash.\n\n06:41.860 --> 06:44.000\n You know, it's the dash that matters.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:45.520\n It's what we do between the time we're born\n\n06:45.520 --> 06:47.800\n and the time we die that gives our life meaning.\n\n06:47.800 --> 06:50.200\n And if we live our lives with a finite mindset,\n\n06:50.200 --> 06:52.420\n which means to accumulate more power or money\n\n06:52.420 --> 06:54.360\n than anybody else, to outdo everyone else,\n\n06:54.360 --> 06:55.760\n to be number one, to be the best,\n\n06:55.760 --> 06:56.920\n we don't take any of us with us.\n\n06:56.920 --> 06:58.580\n We don't take any of it with us.\n\n06:58.580 --> 06:59.540\n We just die.\n\n06:59.540 --> 07:04.200\n The people who get remembered the way we wanna be remembered\n\n07:04.200 --> 07:06.280\n is what kind of people we were, right?\n\n07:06.280 --> 07:08.080\n Devoted mother, loving father,\n\n07:08.080 --> 07:10.560\n what kind of person we were to other people.\n\n07:10.560 --> 07:13.180\n Jack Welch just died recently,\n\n07:13.180 --> 07:14.820\n and the Washington Post,\n\n07:14.820 --> 07:18.360\n when it wrote the headline for his obit,\n\n07:18.360 --> 07:23.160\n it wrote, he pleased Wall Street and distressed employees.\n\n07:23.160 --> 07:24.560\n And that's his legacy.\n\n07:24.560 --> 07:27.920\n A finite player who is obsessed with winning,\n\n07:27.920 --> 07:32.040\n who leaves behind a legacy of short term gains for a few\n\n07:32.040 --> 07:33.680\n and distress for many.\n\n07:33.680 --> 07:34.520\n That's his legacy.\n\n07:34.520 --> 07:37.040\n And every single one of us gets the choice\n\n07:37.040 --> 07:39.640\n of the kind of legacy we wanna have.\n\n07:39.640 --> 07:41.480\n Do we wanna be remembered for our contributions\n\n07:41.480 --> 07:43.880\n or our detractions?\n\n07:43.880 --> 07:45.480\n To live with a finite mindset,\n\n07:45.480 --> 07:47.780\n to live a career with a finite mindset,\n\n07:47.780 --> 07:50.280\n to be number one, be the best, be the most famous,\n\n07:53.200 --> 07:56.360\n you live a life like Jack Welch, you know?\n\n07:56.360 --> 07:59.180\n To live a life of service, to see those around us rise,\n\n07:59.180 --> 08:01.980\n to contribute to our communities, to our organizations,\n\n08:01.980 --> 08:04.600\n to leave them in better shape than we found them,\n\n08:04.600 --> 08:07.860\n that's the kind of legacy most of us would like to have.\n\n08:07.860 --> 08:09.720\n So day to day, when you think about\n\n08:09.720 --> 08:13.720\n what is the fundamental goals, dreams,\n\n08:17.600 --> 08:20.920\n motivations of an infinite game,\n\n08:20.920 --> 08:24.540\n of seeing your life, your career as an infinite game,\n\n08:24.540 --> 08:26.160\n what does that look like?\n\n08:26.160 --> 08:29.640\n I mean, I guess I'm sort of trying to stick\n\n08:29.640 --> 08:32.160\n on this personal ego, personal drive,\n\n08:32.160 --> 08:35.440\n the thing that the fire, the reason we wanna wake up\n\n08:35.440 --> 08:37.500\n in the morning and the reason we can't go to bed\n\n08:37.500 --> 08:39.640\n because we're so excited, what is that?\n\n08:39.640 --> 08:41.780\n So for me, it's about having a just cause.\n\n08:41.780 --> 08:44.260\n It's about a vision that's bigger than me,\n\n08:44.260 --> 08:45.640\n that my work gets to contribute\n\n08:45.640 --> 08:48.420\n to something larger than myself, you know?\n\n08:48.420 --> 08:51.340\n That's what drives me every day.\n\n08:51.340 --> 08:53.800\n I wake up every morning with a vision of a world\n\n08:53.800 --> 08:55.940\n that does not yet exist, a world in which the vast majority\n\n08:55.940 --> 08:58.320\n of people wake up every single morning inspired,\n\n08:58.320 --> 09:01.140\n feel safe at work and return home fulfilled\n\n09:01.140 --> 09:02.080\n at the end of the day.\n\n09:02.080 --> 09:03.680\n It is not the world we live in.\n\n09:03.680 --> 09:06.680\n And so that we still have work to do\n\n09:06.680 --> 09:08.320\n is the thing that drives me.\n\n09:08.320 --> 09:10.880\n You know, I know what my underlying values are.\n\n09:10.880 --> 09:12.380\n You know, I wake up to inspire people\n\n09:12.380 --> 09:13.600\n to do the things that inspire them.\n\n09:13.600 --> 09:16.040\n And these are the things that, these are the things that I,\n\n09:16.040 --> 09:17.880\n these are my go tos, my touch points\n\n09:20.280 --> 09:21.920\n that inspire me to keep working.\n\n09:21.920 --> 09:24.360\n You know, I think of a career like an iceberg.\n\n09:24.360 --> 09:27.000\n You know, if you have a vision for something,\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.660\n you're the only one who can see the iceberg\n\n09:28.660 --> 09:30.320\n underneath the ocean.\n\n09:30.320 --> 09:33.260\n But if you start working at it, a little bit shows up.\n\n09:33.260 --> 09:35.200\n And now a few other people can see what you imagine,\n\n09:35.200 --> 09:36.460\n be like, oh, right, yeah, no,\n\n09:36.460 --> 09:37.720\n I wanna help build that as well.\n\n09:37.720 --> 09:39.320\n And if you have a lot of success,\n\n09:39.320 --> 09:40.280\n then you have a lot of iceberg\n\n09:40.280 --> 09:41.320\n and people can see this huge iceberg\n\n09:41.320 --> 09:43.000\n and they say, you've accomplished so much.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:47.080\n But what I see is all the work still yet to be done.\n\n09:47.080 --> 09:49.720\n You know, I still see the huge iceberg underneath the ocean.\n\n09:49.720 --> 09:52.240\n And so the growth, you talk about momentum.\n\n09:52.240 --> 09:56.720\n So the incremental revealing of the iceberg\n\n09:56.720 --> 09:58.160\n is what drives you.\n\n09:58.160 --> 10:00.680\n Well, it necessarily is incremental.\n\n10:00.680 --> 10:03.600\n What drives me is that, is the realization,\n\n10:03.600 --> 10:06.560\n is realizing the iceberg, bringing more of the iceberg\n\n10:06.560 --> 10:08.040\n from the unknown to the known,\n\n10:08.040 --> 10:11.380\n bringing more of the vision from the imagination to reality.\n\n10:12.320 --> 10:15.480\n And you have this fundamental vision of optimism.\n\n10:15.480 --> 10:17.400\n You call yourself an optimist.\n\n10:17.400 --> 10:20.160\n I mean, in this world, I have a sort of,\n\n10:20.160 --> 10:23.400\n I see myself a little bit as the main character\n\n10:23.400 --> 10:25.360\n from The Idiot by Dostoevsky,\n\n10:25.360 --> 10:29.080\n who is also kind of seen by society as a fool\n\n10:29.080 --> 10:32.320\n because he was optimistic.\n\n10:32.320 --> 10:35.240\n So one, can you maybe articulate\n\n10:35.240 --> 10:37.560\n where that sense of optimism comes from?\n\n10:37.560 --> 10:41.120\n And maybe also try to articulate your vision of the future\n\n10:41.120 --> 10:46.000\n where people are inspired, where optimism drives us.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:48.160\n It's easy to forget that when you look at social media\n\n10:48.160 --> 10:51.080\n and so on, where the word toxicity and negativity\n\n10:51.080 --> 10:53.080\n can often get more likes,\n\n10:53.080 --> 10:56.300\n that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it.\n\n10:56.300 --> 10:58.080\n And I do hope it's out there.\n\n10:58.080 --> 11:00.280\n So can you try to articulate that vision?\n\n11:00.280 --> 11:04.320\n Yeah, so I mean, for me, optimism and being an optimist\n\n11:04.320 --> 11:08.040\n is just seeing the silver lining in every cloud.\n\n11:08.040 --> 11:11.280\n Even in tragedy, it brings people together.\n\n11:11.280 --> 11:12.680\n And the question is, can we see that?\n\n11:12.680 --> 11:15.820\n Can you see the beauty that is in everything?\n\n11:15.820 --> 11:19.480\n And I don't think optimism is foolishness.\n\n11:20.820 --> 11:22.980\n I don't think optimism is blindness,\n\n11:23.980 --> 11:26.140\n though it probably involves some naivete,\n\n11:27.140 --> 11:29.740\n the belief that things will get better,\n\n11:29.740 --> 11:32.500\n the belief that we tend towards the good,\n\n11:33.820 --> 11:36.020\n even in times of struggle or bad.\n\n11:39.200 --> 11:42.420\n You can't sustain war, but you can sustain peace.\n\n11:42.420 --> 11:46.540\n I think things that are stable are more sustainable,\n\n11:46.540 --> 11:49.540\n things that are optimistic are more sustainable\n\n11:49.540 --> 11:52.120\n than things that are chaotic.\n\n11:53.220 --> 11:54.860\n So you see people as fundamentally good.\n\n11:54.860 --> 11:56.540\n I mean, some people may disagree\n\n11:56.540 --> 12:00.460\n that you can't sustain peace, you can't sustain war.\n\n12:00.460 --> 12:03.780\n I mean, I think war is costly.\n\n12:03.780 --> 12:05.300\n It involves life and money,\n\n12:06.300 --> 12:08.500\n and peace does not involve those things.\n\n12:08.500 --> 12:09.740\n It requires work.\n\n12:09.740 --> 12:11.720\n I'm not saying it doesn't require work,\n\n12:11.720 --> 12:14.120\n but it doesn't drain resources,\n\n12:14.120 --> 12:15.820\n I think the same way that war does.\n\n12:17.180 --> 12:19.520\n The people that would say that we will always have war,\n\n12:19.520 --> 12:21.680\n and I just talked to the historian of Stalin,\n\n12:22.980 --> 12:27.100\n would say that conflict and the desire for power\n\n12:27.100 --> 12:30.560\n and conflict is central to human nature.\n\n12:30.560 --> 12:31.880\n I concur.\n\n12:32.880 --> 12:34.940\n But something in your words also,\n\n12:34.940 --> 12:38.140\n perhaps it's the naive aspect that I also share,\n\n12:38.140 --> 12:39.460\n is that you have an optimism\n\n12:39.460 --> 12:41.380\n that people are fundamentally good.\n\n12:41.380 --> 12:44.460\n I'm an idealist, and I think idealism is good.\n\n12:44.460 --> 12:46.820\n I'm not a fool to believe that the ideals\n\n12:46.820 --> 12:48.460\n that I imagine can come true.\n\n12:48.460 --> 12:50.500\n Of course, there'll never be world peace,\n\n12:50.500 --> 12:53.100\n but shouldn't we die trying?\n\n12:53.100 --> 12:54.180\n I think that's the whole point.\n\n12:54.180 --> 12:55.220\n That's the whole point of vision.\n\n12:55.220 --> 12:56.580\n Vision should be idealistic,\n\n12:56.580 --> 13:00.520\n and it should be, for all practical purposes, impossible.\n\n13:02.140 --> 13:03.420\n But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try,\n\n13:03.420 --> 13:06.960\n and it's the milestones that we reach\n\n13:06.960 --> 13:09.260\n that take us closer to that ideal\n\n13:09.260 --> 13:12.420\n that make us feel that our life and our work have meaning,\n\n13:12.420 --> 13:14.460\n and we're contributing to something bigger than ourselves.\n\n13:14.460 --> 13:17.260\n You know, just because it's impossible\n\n13:17.260 --> 13:19.620\n doesn't mean we shouldn't try.\n\n13:19.620 --> 13:21.720\n As I said, we're still moving the ball down the field.\n\n13:21.720 --> 13:23.140\n We're still making progress.\n\n13:23.140 --> 13:24.680\n Things are still getting better,\n\n13:24.680 --> 13:27.300\n even if we never get to that ideal state.\n\n13:27.300 --> 13:29.560\n So I think idealism is a good thing.\n\n13:30.980 --> 13:34.100\n You know, in the word infinite game,\n\n13:34.100 --> 13:37.060\n one of the beautiful and tragic aspects of life,\n\n13:37.060 --> 13:39.260\n human life at least, at least from the biological\n\n13:39.260 --> 13:41.440\n perspective, is that it ends.\n\n13:43.060 --> 13:44.740\n So sadly, it's.\n\n13:44.740 --> 13:46.220\n To some people, yeah.\n\n13:46.220 --> 13:50.300\n Fine, it's tragic to some people, or is it ends, it ends?\n\n13:50.300 --> 13:53.260\n I think some people believe that it ends on the day you die,\n\n13:53.260 --> 13:54.620\n and some people think it continues on.\n\n13:54.620 --> 13:56.460\n There's, and there's a lot of different ways\n\n13:56.460 --> 13:58.780\n to think what continues on even looks like.\n\n13:58.780 --> 14:01.820\n But let me drag it back to the personal.\n\n14:01.820 --> 14:02.660\n Sure.\n\n14:02.660 --> 14:06.180\n Which is, how do you think about your own mortality?\n\n14:06.180 --> 14:07.700\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n14:07.700 --> 14:10.140\n How do you think about your own death?\n\n14:10.140 --> 14:12.380\n I definitely haven't accomplished everything\n\n14:12.380 --> 14:14.060\n I want to contribute to.\n\n14:15.300 --> 14:17.940\n I would like more time on this earth\n\n14:17.940 --> 14:20.700\n to keep working towards that vision.\n\n14:20.700 --> 14:22.580\n Do you think about the fact that it ends for you?\n\n14:22.580 --> 14:23.860\n Are you cognizant of it?\n\n14:23.860 --> 14:24.980\n Of course I'm cognizant of it.\n\n14:24.980 --> 14:26.140\n I mean, aren't we all?\n\n14:27.420 --> 14:29.980\n I don't dwell on it.\n\n14:30.980 --> 14:32.180\n I'm aware of it.\n\n14:32.180 --> 14:33.700\n I know that my life is finite,\n\n14:33.700 --> 14:36.040\n and I know that I have a certain amount of time left\n\n14:36.040 --> 14:40.260\n on this planet, and I'd like to make that time be valuable.\n\n14:40.260 --> 14:42.740\n You know, some people would think that ideas\n\n14:42.740 --> 14:46.860\n kind of allow you to have a certain kind of immortality.\n\n14:46.860 --> 14:47.700\n Yeah.\n\n14:52.340 --> 14:54.620\n Maybe to linger on this kind of question.\n\n14:54.620 --> 14:56.460\n So first to push back on the,\n\n14:56.460 --> 14:58.840\n you said that everyone's cognizant of their mortality.\n\n14:58.840 --> 15:02.660\n There's a guy named Ernest Becker who would disagree,\n\n15:02.660 --> 15:05.460\n that you basically say that most of human cognition\n\n15:05.460 --> 15:09.960\n is created by us trying to create an illusion\n\n15:09.960 --> 15:11.980\n and try to hide the fact from ourselves,\n\n15:11.980 --> 15:13.360\n the fact that we're gonna die,\n\n15:13.360 --> 15:17.000\n to try to think that it's all gonna go on forever.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.540\n But the fact that we know that it doesn't.\n\n15:19.540 --> 15:21.820\n Yes, but this mix of denial.\n\n15:21.820 --> 15:24.420\n I mean, I think the book's called Denial of Death.\n\n15:24.420 --> 15:27.560\n It's this constant denial that we're running away from.\n\n15:30.200 --> 15:33.740\n In fact, some would argue that the inspiration,\n\n15:33.740 --> 15:35.540\n the incredible ideas you've put out there,\n\n15:35.540 --> 15:37.500\n your TED Talk has been seen by millions\n\n15:37.500 --> 15:38.820\n and millions of people, right?\n\n15:38.820 --> 15:41.780\n It's just you trying to desperately fight the fact\n\n15:41.780 --> 15:43.860\n that you are biologically mortal.\n\n15:45.860 --> 15:48.140\n Your creative genius comes from the fact\n\n15:48.140 --> 15:49.440\n that you're trying to create ideas\n\n15:49.440 --> 15:51.100\n that live on long past you.\n\n15:52.180 --> 15:53.140\n Well, that's very nice of you.\n\n15:53.140 --> 15:57.260\n I mean, I would like my ideas to live on beyond me\n\n15:57.260 --> 15:59.420\n because I think that is a good test\n\n15:59.420 --> 16:03.540\n that those ideas have value in the lives of others.\n\n16:03.540 --> 16:05.420\n I think that's a good test.\n\n16:05.420 --> 16:08.780\n That others would continue to talk about\n\n16:08.780 --> 16:12.560\n or share the ideas long after I'm gone,\n\n16:12.560 --> 16:16.420\n I think is perhaps the greatest compliment\n\n16:16.420 --> 16:18.020\n one can get for one's own work.\n\n16:20.620 --> 16:23.460\n But I don't think it's my awareness of my mortality\n\n16:23.460 --> 16:25.580\n that drives me to do it.\n\n16:25.580 --> 16:28.180\n It's my desire to contribute that drives me to do it.\n\n16:30.100 --> 16:32.800\n It's the optimist vision.\n\n16:32.800 --> 16:36.500\n It's the pleasure and the fulfillment you get\n\n16:36.500 --> 16:38.600\n from inspiring others.\n\n16:38.600 --> 16:40.220\n It's as pure as that.\n\n16:42.060 --> 16:43.380\n Let me ask, listen, I'm rushing.\n\n16:43.380 --> 16:47.360\n I'm trying to get you to get you into these dark areas.\n\n16:47.360 --> 16:50.020\n Is the ego tied up into it somehow?\n\n16:50.020 --> 16:54.460\n So your name is extremely well known.\n\n16:54.460 --> 16:56.100\n If your name wasn't attached to it,\n\n16:56.100 --> 16:58.580\n do you think you would act differently?\n\n16:58.580 --> 17:02.280\n I mean, for years, I hated that my name was attached to it.\n\n17:02.280 --> 17:06.100\n I had a rule for years that I wouldn't have my face\n\n17:06.100 --> 17:08.220\n on the front page of the website.\n\n17:09.820 --> 17:10.900\n I had a fight with the publisher\n\n17:10.900 --> 17:14.080\n because I didn't want my name big on the book.\n\n17:14.080 --> 17:15.500\n I wanted it tiny on the book.\n\n17:15.500 --> 17:17.100\n Because I kept telling them it's not about me,\n\n17:17.100 --> 17:18.220\n it's about the ideas.\n\n17:18.220 --> 17:20.660\n They wanted to put my name on the top of my book, I refused.\n\n17:20.660 --> 17:22.460\n None of my books have my names on the top\n\n17:22.460 --> 17:25.300\n because I won't let them.\n\n17:25.300 --> 17:26.560\n They would like very much to put my name\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:27.400\n on the top of the book,\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:30.260\n but the idea has to be bigger than me.\n\n17:30.260 --> 17:32.060\n I'm not bigger than the idea.\n\n17:32.060 --> 17:32.900\n That's beautifully put.\n\n17:32.900 --> 17:34.460\n Do you think ego?\n\n17:34.460 --> 17:38.020\n But I also am aware that I've become recognized\n\n17:38.020 --> 17:39.340\n as the messenger.\n\n17:39.340 --> 17:41.980\n And even though I still think the message is bigger than me,\n\n17:41.980 --> 17:45.160\n I recognize that I have a responsibility as the messenger.\n\n17:45.160 --> 17:47.580\n And whether I like it or not is irrelevant.\n\n17:47.580 --> 17:51.680\n I accept the responsibility, I'm happy to do it.\n\n17:53.060 --> 17:54.760\n I'm not sure how to phrase this,\n\n17:54.760 --> 17:58.940\n but there's a large part of the culture right now\n\n17:58.940 --> 18:03.420\n that emphasizes all the things that nobody disagrees with,\n\n18:03.420 --> 18:07.100\n which is health, sleep, diet, relaxation,\n\n18:07.100 --> 18:10.340\n meditation, vacation, are really important.\n\n18:10.340 --> 18:11.740\n And there's no, it's like,\n\n18:11.740 --> 18:13.460\n you can't really argue against that.\n\n18:13.460 --> 18:14.420\n In fact, people.\n\n18:14.420 --> 18:16.040\n Less sleep.\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:16.880\n Less.\n\n18:16.880 --> 18:17.700\n Just, I'm joking.\n\n18:17.700 --> 18:18.940\n Yes, well, that's the thing.\n\n18:18.940 --> 18:23.820\n I often speak to the fact that passion\n\n18:23.820 --> 18:28.320\n and love for what you're doing and the two words hard work,\n\n18:28.320 --> 18:30.320\n especially in the engineering fields,\n\n18:30.320 --> 18:32.540\n are more important than,\n\n18:32.540 --> 18:35.000\n are more important to prioritize than sleep.\n\n18:35.880 --> 18:38.140\n Even though sleep is really important,\n\n18:38.140 --> 18:40.560\n your mind should be obsessed with the hard work,\n\n18:40.560 --> 18:41.860\n with the passion, and so on.\n\n18:41.860 --> 18:44.900\n And then I get some pushback, of course, from people.\n\n18:44.900 --> 18:46.100\n What do you make sense of that?\n\n18:46.100 --> 18:49.140\n Is that just me, the crazy Russian engineer,\n\n18:49.140 --> 18:50.340\n really pushing hard work?\n\n18:50.340 --> 18:51.160\n Probably.\n\n18:52.460 --> 18:55.120\n I think that that's a short term strategy.\n\n18:55.120 --> 18:57.900\n I think if you sacrifice your health for the work,\n\n18:57.900 --> 19:00.380\n at some point, it catches up with you.\n\n19:00.380 --> 19:02.500\n And at some point, it's like going, going, going,\n\n19:02.500 --> 19:03.460\n and you get sick.\n\n19:03.460 --> 19:04.740\n Your body will shut down for you\n\n19:04.740 --> 19:06.900\n if you refuse to take care of yourself.\n\n19:07.940 --> 19:09.080\n You get sick.\n\n19:09.080 --> 19:09.920\n It's what happens.\n\n19:09.920 --> 19:12.540\n Sometimes, more severe illness\n\n19:12.540 --> 19:14.240\n than something that just slows you down.\n\n19:14.240 --> 19:17.940\n So I think taking, getting sleep,\n\n19:17.940 --> 19:20.900\n I mean, there have been studies on this that,\n\n19:20.900 --> 19:24.060\n executives, for example, who get a full night's sleep\n\n19:24.060 --> 19:26.020\n and stop at a reasonable hour,\n\n19:26.020 --> 19:29.620\n actually accomplish more, are more productive\n\n19:29.620 --> 19:31.540\n than people who work and burn the midnight oil\n\n19:31.540 --> 19:33.500\n because their brains are working better\n\n19:33.500 --> 19:35.380\n because they're well rested.\n\n19:35.380 --> 19:37.940\n So, you know, working hard, yes,\n\n19:37.940 --> 19:39.280\n but why not work smart?\n\n19:41.180 --> 19:45.380\n I think that giving our minds and our bodies rest\n\n19:45.380 --> 19:46.640\n makes us more efficient.\n\n19:47.500 --> 19:49.220\n I think just driving, driving, driving, driving\n\n19:49.220 --> 19:52.100\n is a short term, it's a short term strategy.\n\n19:52.100 --> 19:54.300\n So, but to push back on that a little bit,\n\n19:54.300 --> 19:57.020\n the annoying thing is you're like 100% right\n\n19:57.020 --> 19:58.660\n in terms of science, right?\n\n19:58.660 --> 20:02.940\n But the thing is, because you're 100% right,\n\n20:02.940 --> 20:07.540\n that weak part of your mind uses that fact\n\n20:07.540 --> 20:10.140\n to convince you, like what, so, you know,\n\n20:10.140 --> 20:12.100\n I get all kinds of, my mind comes up\n\n20:12.100 --> 20:14.300\n with all kinds of excuses to try to convince me\n\n20:14.300 --> 20:16.020\n that I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing.\n\n20:16.020 --> 20:18.060\n To rationalize. To rationalize.\n\n20:18.060 --> 20:21.300\n And so what I have a sense,\n\n20:21.300 --> 20:23.820\n I think what you said about executives and leaders\n\n20:23.820 --> 20:26.860\n is absolutely right, but there's the early days.\n\n20:26.860 --> 20:29.100\n The early days of madness and passion.\n\n20:29.100 --> 20:29.940\n For sure.\n\n20:29.940 --> 20:33.700\n Then I feel like emphasizing sleep,\n\n20:33.700 --> 20:37.580\n thinking about sleep is giving yourself a way out\n\n20:37.580 --> 20:39.500\n from the fact that those early days,\n\n20:39.500 --> 20:42.800\n especially, can be suffering.\n\n20:42.800 --> 20:45.700\n As long, it's not sustainable.\n\n20:45.700 --> 20:46.980\n You know, it's not sustainable.\n\n20:46.980 --> 20:50.140\n Sure, if you're investing all that energy in something\n\n20:50.140 --> 20:52.620\n at the beginning to get it up and running,\n\n20:52.620 --> 20:55.660\n then at some point you're gonna have to slow down.\n\n20:55.660 --> 20:57.580\n Or your body will slow you down for you.\n\n20:57.580 --> 20:59.980\n Like, you can choose or your body can choose.\n\n21:01.820 --> 21:02.660\n I mean.\n\n21:02.660 --> 21:04.820\n So, okay, so you don't think, from my perspective,\n\n21:04.820 --> 21:07.380\n it feels like people have gotten a little bit soft.\n\n21:07.380 --> 21:08.220\n But you're saying, no.\n\n21:08.220 --> 21:11.140\n I think that there seems evidence\n\n21:11.140 --> 21:16.140\n that working harder and later have taken a back seat.\n\n21:16.140 --> 21:18.300\n I've taken a back seat.\n\n21:21.580 --> 21:24.660\n I think we have to be careful with broad generalizations.\n\n21:24.660 --> 21:28.140\n But I think if you go into the workplace,\n\n21:28.140 --> 21:29.540\n there are people who would complain\n\n21:29.540 --> 21:33.300\n that more people now than before,\n\n21:33.300 --> 21:34.940\n you know, look at their watches and say,\n\n21:34.940 --> 21:36.580\n oops, five o clock, goodbye.\n\n21:36.580 --> 21:37.420\n Right?\n\n21:37.420 --> 21:39.580\n Now, is that a problem with the people?\n\n21:39.580 --> 21:41.700\n You're saying it's the people giving themselves excuses\n\n21:41.700 --> 21:42.960\n and people who don't work hard.\n\n21:42.960 --> 21:45.040\n Or is it the organizations aren't giving them something\n\n21:45.040 --> 21:46.820\n to believe in, something to be passionate about?\n\n21:46.820 --> 21:48.100\n We can't manufacture passion.\n\n21:48.100 --> 21:51.040\n You can't just tell someone, be passionate.\n\n21:51.040 --> 21:52.360\n You know, that's not how it works.\n\n21:52.360 --> 21:54.100\n Passion's an output, not an input.\n\n21:55.420 --> 21:56.440\n Like if I believe in something\n\n21:56.440 --> 21:58.780\n and I wanna contribute all that energy to do it,\n\n21:58.780 --> 22:00.220\n we call that passion.\n\n22:00.220 --> 22:02.340\n You know, working hard for something we love is passion.\n\n22:02.340 --> 22:04.140\n Working hard for something we don't care about\n\n22:04.140 --> 22:05.260\n is called stress.\n\n22:05.260 --> 22:07.760\n But we're working hard either way.\n\n22:07.760 --> 22:10.380\n So I think the organizations bear some accountability\n\n22:10.380 --> 22:11.680\n and our leaders bear some accountability,\n\n22:11.680 --> 22:13.580\n which is if they're not offering a sense of purpose,\n\n22:13.580 --> 22:15.500\n if they're not offering us a sense of cause,\n\n22:15.500 --> 22:17.660\n if they're not telling us that our work is worth more\n\n22:17.660 --> 22:19.780\n than simply the money it makes,\n\n22:19.780 --> 22:21.140\n then yeah, I'm gonna come at five o clock\n\n22:21.140 --> 22:23.180\n because I don't really care about making you money.\n\n22:23.180 --> 22:24.620\n Remember, we live in a world right now\n\n22:24.620 --> 22:26.980\n where a lot of people, rather a few people,\n\n22:26.980 --> 22:29.700\n are getting rich on the hard work of others.\n\n22:29.700 --> 22:33.020\n And so I think when people look up and say,\n\n22:33.020 --> 22:34.620\n well, why would I do that?\n\n22:34.620 --> 22:36.600\n I'll just, if you're not gonna look after me\n\n22:36.600 --> 22:38.180\n and then you're gonna lay me off at the end of the year\n\n22:38.180 --> 22:40.460\n because you missed your arbitrary projections,\n\n22:40.460 --> 22:41.740\n you know, you're gonna lay me off\n\n22:41.740 --> 22:43.940\n because you missed your arbitrary projections,\n\n22:43.940 --> 22:47.420\n then why would I offer my hard work and loyalty to you?\n\n22:47.420 --> 22:50.740\n So I think, I don't think we can immediately blame people\n\n22:50.740 --> 22:51.940\n for going soft.\n\n22:51.940 --> 22:56.940\n I think we can blame leaders for their inability\n\n22:56.980 --> 22:59.420\n or failure to offer their people something bigger\n\n22:59.420 --> 23:02.660\n than making a product or making money.\n\n23:02.660 --> 23:04.300\n Yeah, so that's brilliant.\n\n23:04.300 --> 23:07.940\n And start with why, leaders eat less, your books.\n\n23:07.940 --> 23:12.940\n You basically talk about what it takes to be a good leader.\n\n23:13.980 --> 23:15.700\n And so some of the blame should go on the leader,\n\n23:15.700 --> 23:19.900\n but how much of it is on finding your passion?\n\n23:19.900 --> 23:21.900\n How much is it on the individual?\n\n23:21.900 --> 23:24.780\n And allowing yourself to pursue that passion,\n\n23:24.780 --> 23:26.140\n pushing yourself to your limits,\n\n23:26.140 --> 23:30.220\n to really take concrete steps\n\n23:30.220 --> 23:33.220\n along your path towards that passion.\n\n23:33.220 --> 23:34.620\n Yeah, there's mutual responsibility.\n\n23:34.620 --> 23:35.540\n There's mutual accountability.\n\n23:35.540 --> 23:37.380\n I mean, we're responsible as individuals\n\n23:37.380 --> 23:39.980\n to find the organizations and find the leaders\n\n23:39.980 --> 23:41.180\n that inspire us.\n\n23:41.180 --> 23:43.420\n And organizations are responsible for maintaining\n\n23:43.420 --> 23:46.380\n that flame and giving people who believe\n\n23:46.380 --> 23:49.220\n what they believed, you know, a chance to contribute.\n\n23:50.580 --> 23:51.780\n Sort of to linger on it,\n\n23:51.780 --> 23:54.020\n have you by chance seen the movie Whiplash?\n\n23:54.020 --> 23:54.860\n Yes.\n\n23:56.500 --> 23:59.380\n Again, maybe I'm romanticizing suffering.\n\n23:59.380 --> 24:00.420\n Again. It's the Russian in you.\n\n24:00.420 --> 24:01.660\n It's the Russian. Yeah.\n\n24:01.660 --> 24:03.380\n The Russians love suffering.\n\n24:03.380 --> 24:07.660\n But for people who haven't seen,\n\n24:07.660 --> 24:10.860\n the movie Whiplash has a drum instructor\n\n24:10.860 --> 24:15.860\n that pushes the drum musician to his limits\n\n24:16.540 --> 24:18.660\n to bring out the best in him.\n\n24:18.660 --> 24:20.420\n And there's a toxic nature to it.\n\n24:20.420 --> 24:21.780\n There's suffering in it.\n\n24:21.780 --> 24:24.300\n Like you've worked with a lot of great leaders,\n\n24:24.300 --> 24:25.500\n a lot of great individuals.\n\n24:25.500 --> 24:29.380\n So is that toxic relationship as toxic\n\n24:29.380 --> 24:30.460\n as it appears in the movie?\n\n24:30.460 --> 24:31.420\n Or is that fundamental?\n\n24:31.420 --> 24:33.620\n I've seen that relationship,\n\n24:33.620 --> 24:36.420\n especially in the past with Olympic athletes,\n\n24:36.420 --> 24:39.780\n especially in athletics, extreme performers\n\n24:39.780 --> 24:40.860\n seem to do wonders.\n\n24:40.860 --> 24:42.060\n It does wonders for me.\n\n24:42.060 --> 24:44.900\n There's some of my best relationships,\n\n24:44.900 --> 24:47.660\n now I'm not representative of everyone certainly,\n\n24:47.660 --> 24:51.100\n but some of my best relationships for mentee and mentor\n\n24:51.100 --> 24:54.900\n have been toxic from an external perspective.\n\n24:56.420 --> 24:57.700\n What do you make of that movie?\n\n24:57.700 --> 25:00.580\n What do you make of that kind of relationship?\n\n25:00.580 --> 25:02.060\n That's not my favorite movie.\n\n25:04.140 --> 25:06.940\n Okay, so you don't think that's a healthy,\n\n25:06.940 --> 25:08.660\n you don't think that kind of relationship\n\n25:08.660 --> 25:11.940\n is a great example of a great leader?\n\n25:11.940 --> 25:13.060\n No, I think it's a short term strategy.\n\n25:13.060 --> 25:13.900\n I mean, short term.\n\n25:13.900 --> 25:15.460\n I mean, look, being hard on someone\n\n25:15.460 --> 25:16.820\n is not the same as toxicity.\n\n25:18.580 --> 25:20.020\n If you go to the Marine Corps,\n\n25:21.900 --> 25:26.140\n a drill instructor will be very hard on their Marines.\n\n25:26.140 --> 25:29.500\n And then, but still, even on the last day of bootcamp,\n\n25:29.500 --> 25:32.020\n they'll take their hat off and they'll become a human.\n\n25:32.020 --> 25:34.820\n But of all the drill instructors,\n\n25:34.820 --> 25:38.740\n you know, the three or four main drill instructors\n\n25:38.740 --> 25:40.500\n assigned to a group of recruits,\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:42.100\n the one that they all want the respect of\n\n25:42.100 --> 25:44.100\n is the one that's the hardest on them.\n\n25:44.100 --> 25:45.820\n That's true.\n\n25:45.820 --> 25:47.660\n And you hear, you know,\n\n25:47.660 --> 25:48.660\n there's plenty of stories of people\n\n25:48.660 --> 25:50.940\n who want to earn the respect of a hard parent\n\n25:50.940 --> 25:52.060\n or a hard teacher.\n\n25:53.100 --> 25:55.020\n But fundamental, that parent, that teacher,\n\n25:55.020 --> 25:57.300\n that drill instructor has to believe in that person,\n\n25:57.300 --> 25:58.620\n has to see potential in them.\n\n25:58.620 --> 25:59.860\n It's not a formula,\n\n25:59.860 --> 26:01.940\n which is if I'm hard on people, they'll do well,\n\n26:01.940 --> 26:04.100\n which is there has to still be love.\n\n26:04.100 --> 26:05.980\n It has to be done with absolute love.\n\n26:05.980 --> 26:08.980\n And it has to be done responsibly.\n\n26:08.980 --> 26:09.860\n I mean, some people can take\n\n26:09.860 --> 26:11.780\n a little more pressure than others,\n\n26:11.780 --> 26:13.860\n but it's not, I think it's irresponsible\n\n26:13.860 --> 26:15.700\n to think of it as a formula\n\n26:15.700 --> 26:19.460\n that if I'm just toxic at people, they will do well.\n\n26:20.460 --> 26:21.820\n It depends on their personalities.\n\n26:21.820 --> 26:23.900\n First of all, it works for some, but not all.\n\n26:23.900 --> 26:27.540\n And second of all, it can't be done willy nilly.\n\n26:27.540 --> 26:29.980\n It has to still be done with care and love.\n\n26:29.980 --> 26:34.980\n And sometimes you can get equal or better results\n\n26:36.220 --> 26:37.700\n without all of the toxicity.\n\n26:37.700 --> 26:41.900\n So one of the, I guess toxicity on my part\n\n26:41.900 --> 26:43.540\n was a really bad word to use,\n\n26:43.540 --> 26:46.420\n but if we talk about what makes a good leader\n\n26:46.420 --> 26:49.660\n and just look at an example in particular,\n\n26:49.660 --> 26:51.220\n looking at Elon Musk,\n\n26:51.220 --> 26:54.220\n he's known to push people to their limits\n\n26:54.220 --> 26:59.220\n in a way that I think really challenges people\n\n27:01.340 --> 27:03.060\n in a way they've never been challenged before\n\n27:03.060 --> 27:04.420\n to do the impossible.\n\n27:04.420 --> 27:07.300\n But it can really break people.\n\n27:07.300 --> 27:11.260\n And jobs was hard and Amazon is hard.\n\n27:11.260 --> 27:15.220\n But the thing that's important is none of them lie about it.\n\n27:15.220 --> 27:16.420\n People ask me about Amazon all the time.\n\n27:16.420 --> 27:18.780\n Like Jeff Bezos never lied about it.\n\n27:18.780 --> 27:20.460\n Even the ones who like Amazon don't last\n\n27:20.460 --> 27:22.860\n more than a couple of years before they burn out.\n\n27:22.860 --> 27:25.340\n But when we're honest about the culture,\n\n27:25.340 --> 27:26.620\n then it gives people the opportunity\n\n27:26.620 --> 27:28.100\n who like to work in that kind of culture\n\n27:28.100 --> 27:29.940\n to choose to work in that kind of culture,\n\n27:29.940 --> 27:31.380\n as opposed to pretending and saying,\n\n27:31.380 --> 27:34.500\n oh no, this is all, it's all lovey lovey here.\n\n27:34.500 --> 27:37.260\n And then you show up and it's the furthest thing from it.\n\n27:37.260 --> 27:41.420\n So, I mean, I think the reputations\n\n27:41.420 --> 27:44.060\n of putting a lot of pressure on people to,\n\n27:44.060 --> 27:48.780\n jobs was not an easy man to work for.\n\n27:48.780 --> 27:50.940\n He pushed people, but everyone who worked there\n\n27:50.940 --> 27:52.980\n was given the space to create and do things\n\n27:52.980 --> 27:54.740\n that they would not have been able to do anywhere else\n\n27:54.740 --> 27:56.980\n and work at a level that they didn't work anywhere else.\n\n27:56.980 --> 27:58.740\n And jobs didn't have all the answers.\n\n27:58.740 --> 28:02.100\n I mean, he pushed his people to come up with answers.\n\n28:02.100 --> 28:05.820\n He wasn't just looking for people to execute his ideas.\n\n28:07.460 --> 28:09.220\n And people did, people accomplished more\n\n28:09.220 --> 28:12.300\n than they thought they were capable of, which is wonderful.\n\n28:12.300 --> 28:15.660\n How do you, you're talking about the infinite game\n\n28:16.500 --> 28:19.820\n and not thinking about too short term.\n\n28:19.820 --> 28:22.860\n And yet you see some of the most brilliant people\n\n28:22.860 --> 28:24.740\n in the world being pushed by Elam us\n\n28:24.740 --> 28:27.060\n to accomplish some of the most incredible things.\n\n28:27.060 --> 28:28.420\n When we're talking about autopilot,\n\n28:28.420 --> 28:32.020\n when we're talking about some of the hardware engineering,\n\n28:32.020 --> 28:35.180\n and they do some of the best work of their life\n\n28:35.180 --> 28:37.340\n and then leave.\n\n28:37.340 --> 28:40.300\n How do you balance that in terms of what it takes\n\n28:40.300 --> 28:41.700\n to be a good leader,\n\n28:41.700 --> 28:44.660\n what it takes to accomplish great things in your life?\n\n28:44.660 --> 28:49.380\n So I think there's a difference between someone\n\n28:49.380 --> 28:52.660\n who can get a lot out of people in the short term\n\n28:52.660 --> 28:53.700\n and building an organization\n\n28:53.700 --> 28:55.660\n that can sustain beyond any individual.\n\n28:57.180 --> 28:58.060\n There's a difference.\n\n28:58.060 --> 28:59.420\n When you say beyond any individual,\n\n28:59.420 --> 29:03.020\n you mean beyond like if the leader dies.\n\n29:03.020 --> 29:03.860\n Correct.\n\n29:03.860 --> 29:05.540\n Like could Tesla continue to do what it's doing\n\n29:05.540 --> 29:06.700\n without Elon Musk?\n\n29:08.540 --> 29:10.700\n And you're perhaps implying,\n\n29:10.700 --> 29:13.660\n which is a very interesting question that it cannot.\n\n29:13.660 --> 29:15.100\n I don't know.\n\n29:15.100 --> 29:16.420\n You know, the argument you're making\n\n29:16.420 --> 29:20.140\n of this person who pushes everyone\n\n29:20.140 --> 29:23.340\n arguably is not a repeatable model, right?\n\n29:23.340 --> 29:25.780\n You know, is Apple the same without Steve Jobs\n\n29:25.780 --> 29:28.260\n or is it slowly moving in a different direction?\n\n29:29.860 --> 29:31.060\n Or has he established something\n\n29:31.060 --> 29:34.060\n that could be resurrected with the right leader?\n\n29:34.060 --> 29:35.700\n That was his dream, I think,\n\n29:35.700 --> 29:39.940\n is to build an organization that lives on beyond them.\n\n29:39.940 --> 29:40.780\n At least I remember reading that somewhere.\n\n29:40.780 --> 29:44.340\n I think that's what a lot of leaders desire,\n\n29:44.340 --> 29:47.340\n which is to create something that was bigger than them.\n\n29:47.340 --> 29:51.500\n You know, most businesses, most entrepreneurial ventures\n\n29:51.500 --> 29:54.900\n could not pass the school bus test,\n\n29:54.900 --> 29:57.180\n which is if the founder was hit by a school bus,\n\n29:57.180 --> 29:58.820\n would everyone continue the business without them\n\n29:58.820 --> 30:01.140\n or would they all just go find jobs?\n\n30:01.140 --> 30:04.820\n And the vast majority of companies would fail that test,\n\n30:04.820 --> 30:08.300\n you know, especially in the entrepreneurial world\n\n30:08.300 --> 30:11.020\n that if you take the inspired visionary leader away,\n\n30:11.020 --> 30:12.380\n the whole thing collapses.\n\n30:12.380 --> 30:13.660\n So is that a business\n\n30:13.660 --> 30:15.940\n or is that just a force of personality?\n\n30:15.940 --> 30:19.300\n And a lot of entrepreneurs, you know, face that reality,\n\n30:19.300 --> 30:20.580\n which is they have to be in every meeting,\n\n30:20.580 --> 30:24.100\n make every decision, you know, come up with every idea,\n\n30:24.100 --> 30:25.860\n because if they don't, who will?\n\n30:25.860 --> 30:27.380\n And the question is, is, well,\n\n30:27.380 --> 30:29.340\n what have you done to build your bench?\n\n30:31.100 --> 30:33.380\n Is it, it's not, sometimes it's ego,\n\n30:33.380 --> 30:35.420\n the belief that only I can.\n\n30:35.420 --> 30:39.700\n Sometimes it's just things got,\n\n30:39.700 --> 30:43.660\n did so well for so long that just forgot.\n\n30:43.660 --> 30:46.220\n And sometimes it's a failure\n\n30:48.300 --> 30:51.860\n to build the training programs or hire the right people\n\n30:51.860 --> 30:53.780\n that could replace you,\n\n30:53.780 --> 30:56.100\n who are maybe smarter and better.\n\n30:58.020 --> 31:01.500\n And browbeating people is only one strategy.\n\n31:01.500 --> 31:03.500\n I don't think it's necessarily the only strategy,\n\n31:03.500 --> 31:05.100\n nor is it always the best strategy.\n\n31:05.100 --> 31:07.140\n I think people get to choose the cultures\n\n31:07.140 --> 31:07.980\n they wanna work in.\n\n31:07.980 --> 31:11.740\n This is why I think companies should be honest\n\n31:12.860 --> 31:15.220\n about the kind of culture that they've created.\n\n31:16.100 --> 31:18.100\n You know, I heard a story about Apple\n\n31:18.100 --> 31:21.340\n where somebody came in from a big company,\n\n31:21.340 --> 31:23.380\n you know, he had accomplished a lot\n\n31:23.380 --> 31:26.220\n and his ego was very large\n\n31:26.220 --> 31:28.420\n and he was going on about how he did this and he did that\n\n31:28.420 --> 31:30.460\n and he did this and he did that.\n\n31:30.460 --> 31:32.340\n And somebody from Apple said,\n\n31:32.340 --> 31:34.580\n we don't care what you've done.\n\n31:34.580 --> 31:36.420\n The question is, what are you gonna do?\n\n31:36.420 --> 31:41.420\n And that's, you know, for somebody who wants to be pushed,\n\n31:41.420 --> 31:44.500\n that's the place you go because you choose to be pushed.\n\n31:45.620 --> 31:47.460\n Now, we all wanna be pushed to some degree,\n\n31:47.460 --> 31:49.700\n you know, anybody who wants to, you know,\n\n31:49.700 --> 31:50.740\n accomplish anything in this world\n\n31:50.740 --> 31:51.980\n wants to be pushed to some degree,\n\n31:51.980 --> 31:55.220\n whether it's through self pressure or external pressure\n\n31:55.220 --> 31:57.700\n or, you know, public pressure, whatever it is.\n\n31:59.860 --> 32:02.940\n But I think this whole idea of one size fits all\n\n32:02.940 --> 32:05.740\n is a false narrative of how leadership works,\n\n32:05.740 --> 32:08.580\n but what all leadership requires is creating an environment\n\n32:08.580 --> 32:10.540\n in which people can work at their natural best.\n\n32:10.540 --> 32:12.940\n But you have a sense that it's possible\n\n32:12.940 --> 32:17.780\n to create a business where it lives on beyond you.\n\n32:17.780 --> 32:19.740\n So if we look at now,\n\n32:19.740 --> 32:21.820\n if we just look at this current moment,\n\n32:21.820 --> 32:25.100\n I just recently talked to Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter,\n\n32:25.100 --> 32:26.780\n and he's under a lot of pressure now.\n\n32:26.780 --> 32:28.180\n I don't know if you're aware of the news\n\n32:28.180 --> 32:31.700\n that he's being pushed out as a potential CEO of Twitter\n\n32:31.700 --> 32:33.140\n because he's the CEO already\n\n32:33.140 --> 32:35.180\n of an incredibly successful company\n\n32:35.180 --> 32:39.180\n plus he wants to go to Africa to live a few months in Africa\n\n32:39.180 --> 32:43.820\n to connect with the world that's outside of the Silicon Valley\n\n32:43.820 --> 32:45.780\n and sort of, there's this idea,\n\n32:45.780 --> 32:48.420\n well, can Twitter live without Jack?\n\n32:48.420 --> 32:49.260\n We'll find out.\n\n32:50.260 --> 32:55.260\n But you have a general, as a student of great leadership,\n\n32:55.660 --> 32:57.540\n you have a general sense that it's possible.\n\n32:57.540 --> 32:58.540\n Yeah, of course it's possible.\n\n32:58.540 --> 33:01.660\n I mean, what Bill Gates built with Microsoft\n\n33:01.660 --> 33:04.260\n may not have survived Steve Ballmer\n\n33:04.260 --> 33:06.540\n if the company weren't so rich,\n\n33:06.540 --> 33:11.260\n but Sachin Ardala is putting it back on track again.\n\n33:11.260 --> 33:12.900\n It's become a visionary company again.\n\n33:12.900 --> 33:14.060\n It's attracting great talent again.\n\n33:14.060 --> 33:14.900\n It went through a period\n\n33:14.900 --> 33:16.500\n where they couldn't get the best talent\n\n33:16.500 --> 33:17.860\n and the best talent was leaving.\n\n33:17.860 --> 33:19.660\n Now people wanna work for Microsoft again.\n\n33:19.660 --> 33:21.900\n Well, that's not because of pressure.\n\n33:21.900 --> 33:24.340\n Ballmer put more pressure on people\n\n33:24.340 --> 33:26.940\n mainly to hit numbers than anything else.\n\n33:26.940 --> 33:28.660\n That didn't work.\n\n33:28.660 --> 33:30.500\n Yes. Right?\n\n33:30.500 --> 33:31.980\n And so the question is,\n\n33:31.980 --> 33:33.340\n what kind of pressure are we putting on people?\n\n33:33.340 --> 33:35.580\n We're putting on pressure people to hit numbers\n\n33:35.580 --> 33:38.140\n or hit arbitrary deadlines,\n\n33:38.140 --> 33:39.420\n or we're putting on pressure on people\n\n33:39.420 --> 33:41.900\n because we believe that they can do better work.\n\n33:41.900 --> 33:44.340\n And the work that we're trying to do\n\n33:44.340 --> 33:46.580\n is to advance a vision that's bigger than all of us.\n\n33:46.580 --> 33:47.900\n And if you're gonna put pressure on people,\n\n33:47.900 --> 33:49.700\n it better be for the right reason.\n\n33:49.700 --> 33:50.940\n Like if you're gonna put pressure on me,\n\n33:50.940 --> 33:52.460\n it better be for a worthwhile reason.\n\n33:52.460 --> 33:54.300\n If it's just to hit a goal,\n\n33:54.300 --> 33:55.900\n if it's just to hit some arbitrary date\n\n33:55.900 --> 33:58.100\n or some arbitrary number or make a stock price\n\n33:58.100 --> 34:01.060\n hit some target, you can keep it, I'm outta here.\n\n34:01.060 --> 34:02.140\n But if you wanna put pressure on me\n\n34:02.140 --> 34:06.900\n because we are brothers and sisters in arms\n\n34:06.900 --> 34:09.020\n working to advance a cause bigger than ourselves,\n\n34:09.020 --> 34:10.660\n that we believe whatever we're gonna build\n\n34:10.660 --> 34:12.340\n will significantly contribute\n\n34:12.340 --> 34:14.140\n to the greater good of society,\n\n34:14.140 --> 34:16.220\n then go ahead, I'll take the pressure.\n\n34:16.220 --> 34:17.380\n And if you look at the Apples\n\n34:17.380 --> 34:22.380\n and if you look at the Elon Musk's,\n\n34:23.060 --> 34:24.100\n the Jobs and the Elon Musk,\n\n34:24.100 --> 34:26.060\n they fundamentally believed that what they were doing\n\n34:26.060 --> 34:27.460\n would improve society.\n\n34:27.460 --> 34:30.140\n And it was for the good of humankind.\n\n34:31.140 --> 34:33.740\n And so the pressure, in other words,\n\n34:33.740 --> 34:36.020\n what they were doing was more important,\n\n34:36.020 --> 34:38.220\n more valuable than any individual on the team.\n\n34:39.820 --> 34:41.140\n And so the pressure they put on people\n\n34:41.140 --> 34:42.900\n served a greater good.\n\n34:42.900 --> 34:45.620\n And so we looked to the left\n\n34:45.620 --> 34:47.500\n and we looked to the right to each other and said,\n\n34:47.500 --> 34:49.060\n we're in this together.\n\n34:49.060 --> 34:51.540\n We accept this, we want this.\n\n34:51.540 --> 34:54.820\n But if it's just pressure to hit a number\n\n34:54.820 --> 34:59.100\n or make the widget move a little faster,\n\n35:01.220 --> 35:02.380\n that's soul sucking.\n\n35:03.540 --> 35:06.580\n That's not passion, that's stress.\n\n35:06.580 --> 35:11.140\n And I think a lot of leaders confuse\n\n35:11.140 --> 35:12.260\n that making people work hard\n\n35:12.260 --> 35:13.900\n is not what makes them passionate.\n\n35:15.060 --> 35:17.540\n Giving to them something to believe in\n\n35:17.540 --> 35:20.860\n and work on is what drives passion.\n\n35:20.860 --> 35:23.100\n And when you have that, then turning up the pressure\n\n35:23.100 --> 35:26.580\n only brings people together,\n\n35:26.580 --> 35:27.420\n drives them further.\n\n35:27.420 --> 35:28.820\n If done the right way.\n\n35:28.820 --> 35:30.740\n If done the right way.\n\n35:30.740 --> 35:32.260\n Speaking of pressure,\n\n35:32.260 --> 35:36.980\n I'm gonna give you 90 seconds to answer the last question,\n\n35:36.980 --> 35:39.420\n which is if I told you that tomorrow\n\n35:39.420 --> 35:41.140\n was your last day to live,\n\n35:41.140 --> 35:42.860\n we talked about mortality,\n\n35:42.860 --> 35:45.260\n sunrise to sunset, can you tell me,\n\n35:45.260 --> 35:46.300\n can you take me through the day?\n\n35:46.300 --> 35:48.460\n What do you think that day would involve?\n\n35:48.460 --> 35:50.220\n You can't spend it with your family,\n\n35:50.220 --> 35:52.060\n I told you as well.\n\n35:52.060 --> 35:54.940\n I would probably want to fill all of my senses\n\n35:54.940 --> 35:59.100\n with things that excite my senses.\n\n35:59.100 --> 36:00.420\n I'd want to look at beautiful art.\n\n36:00.420 --> 36:02.860\n I'd want to listen to beautiful music.\n\n36:02.860 --> 36:04.900\n I'd want to taste incredible food.\n\n36:04.900 --> 36:06.900\n I'd want to smell amazing tastes.\n\n36:06.900 --> 36:11.900\n I'd want to touch something that's beautiful to touch.\n\n36:14.100 --> 36:18.140\n I'd want all of my senses to just be consumed\n\n36:19.180 --> 36:21.100\n with things that I find beautiful.\n\n36:21.100 --> 36:23.260\n And you talked about this idea of\n\n36:23.260 --> 36:24.780\n we don't do it often these days,\n\n36:24.780 --> 36:27.380\n of just listening to music, turning off all the devices\n\n36:27.380 --> 36:29.820\n and actually taking in and listening to music.\n\n36:29.820 --> 36:31.740\n So as an addendum,\n\n36:33.300 --> 36:34.500\n if we were to talk about music,\n\n36:34.500 --> 36:36.420\n what song would you be blasting\n\n36:36.420 --> 36:38.100\n on this last day you're alive?\n\n36:38.100 --> 36:39.060\n Is it Led Zeppelin?\n\n36:39.060 --> 36:39.900\n What are we talking about?\n\n36:39.900 --> 36:40.740\n That I love.\n\n36:40.740 --> 36:41.580\n No, no.\n\n36:41.580 --> 36:42.940\n There's probably gonna be a Beatles song in there.\n\n36:42.940 --> 36:45.100\n There'll definitely be some Beethoven in there.\n\n36:46.460 --> 36:47.500\n The classics.\n\n36:47.500 --> 36:48.340\n The classics.\n\n36:48.340 --> 36:49.180\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n36:49.180 --> 36:51.860\n Well, thank you so much for talking today.\n\n36:51.860 --> 36:53.620\n Thank you for making time for it.\n\n36:53.620 --> 36:55.420\n Under pressure, we made it happen.\n\n36:55.420 --> 36:56.860\n It was great.\n\n36:56.860 --> 36:58.420\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n36:58.420 --> 36:59.740\n with Simon Sinek.\n\n36:59.740 -->
