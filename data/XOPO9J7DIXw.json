drink, saliva, mucus, snot,\n\n00:06.580 --> 00:08.280\n whatever you're gonna swallow.\n\n00:08.280 --> 00:10.460\n All of that stuff must go down the esophagus,\n\n00:10.460 --> 00:12.620\n the food tube, and end up in the stomach.\n\n00:12.620 --> 00:15.620\n And right next to the esophagus, millimeters away,\n\n00:15.620 --> 00:17.500\n is the windpipe or the trachea,\n\n00:17.500 --> 00:18.980\n which goes down to the lungs.\n\n00:18.980 --> 00:21.620\n Throat, heart, feces, genitals.\n\n00:21.620 --> 00:24.860\n Every organ from moment to moment keeps us alive\n\n00:24.860 --> 00:25.980\n and ensures our survival.\n\n00:25.980 --> 00:27.900\n The genitals are, in a way, the opposite.\n\n00:27.900 --> 00:31.460\n How would you improve the penis and the vagina?\n\n00:33.940 --> 00:36.620\n The following is a conversation with Jonathan Reisman,\n\n00:36.620 --> 00:40.020\n a physician and writer of The Unseen Body,\n\n00:40.020 --> 00:42.580\n a doctor's journey through the hidden wonders\n\n00:42.580 --> 00:44.140\n of human anatomy.\n\n00:44.140 --> 00:46.620\n He has practiced medicine in some of the world's\n\n00:46.620 --> 00:49.740\n most remote places, including the Alaskan\n\n00:49.740 --> 00:52.840\n and Russian Arctic, Antarctica,\n\n00:52.840 --> 00:56.560\n and the Himalayan mountains of Nepal.\n\n00:56.560 --> 00:58.740\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:58.740 --> 01:00.960\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:00.960 --> 01:02.340\n in the description.\n\n01:02.340 --> 01:05.860\n And now, dear friends, here's Jonathan Reisman.\n\n01:06.740 --> 01:09.500\n You wrote a book called Unseen Body,\n\n01:09.500 --> 01:12.180\n all about the human body, the messy, the weird,\n\n01:12.180 --> 01:14.840\n the beautiful, and the fascinating details.\n\n01:15.980 --> 01:18.280\n So, from an evolutionary perspective,\n\n01:18.280 --> 01:21.900\n are most parts of the human body a feature or a bug?\n\n01:21.900 --> 01:24.220\n Is it like the optimal solution\n\n01:24.220 --> 01:26.280\n or just a duct tape solution?\n\n01:26.280 --> 01:27.160\n Great question.\n\n01:27.160 --> 01:29.460\n I think that most of the time,\n\n01:29.460 --> 01:32.420\n the way the body works is the best solution.\n\n01:32.420 --> 01:35.660\n I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare.\n\n01:35.660 --> 01:38.240\n But I think, you know, there's some parts of the body\n\n01:38.240 --> 01:40.160\n that make more sense than others.\n\n01:40.160 --> 01:43.560\n You know, the way our hands work, for instance.\n\n01:43.560 --> 01:45.320\n You know, the muscles are up in the forearm\n\n01:45.320 --> 01:47.060\n and then the tendons kind of come down\n\n01:47.060 --> 01:48.900\n like strings on a puppet.\n\n01:48.900 --> 01:50.740\n And just the dexterity it gives our hands\n\n01:50.740 --> 01:52.640\n is just really amazing.\n\n01:52.640 --> 01:55.340\n And it's hard to imagine a better tool\n\n01:55.340 --> 01:57.380\n than the human hand to do everything from, you know,\n\n01:57.380 --> 01:59.780\n hold things to play piano\n\n01:59.780 --> 02:02.580\n and do a million other daily activities that we do.\n\n02:03.960 --> 02:05.100\n One thing I talk about in the book,\n\n02:05.100 --> 02:07.820\n there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking\n\n02:07.820 --> 02:11.540\n that kind of brilliant design, such as the throat,\n\n02:11.540 --> 02:15.260\n you know, where the food, drink are swallowed\n\n02:15.260 --> 02:17.000\n and air is inhaled, and they kind of,\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.860\n those two paths come within millimeters of each other.\n\n02:19.860 --> 02:22.580\n And you slip up once, you laugh while eating,\n\n02:22.580 --> 02:25.540\n or you speak while trying to swallow and you die\n\n02:25.540 --> 02:26.380\n from choking.\n\n02:26.380 --> 02:28.300\n So it seems less than optimal,\n\n02:28.300 --> 02:30.060\n though I'm not sure it could be better\n\n02:30.060 --> 02:33.020\n from the way we're kind of formed in the womb\n\n02:33.020 --> 02:35.860\n as a beginning as this tiny little tube.\n\n02:35.860 --> 02:37.700\n I don't think it could have been done any better\n\n02:37.700 --> 02:39.100\n or there's any other way to do it,\n\n02:39.100 --> 02:41.500\n but it is an unfortunate thing that, you know,\n\n02:41.500 --> 02:42.980\n does lead to some problems.\n\n02:42.980 --> 02:46.420\n So the hand, if I could just link on that for a second,\n\n02:46.420 --> 02:50.420\n you talk about the wisdom of a design in the book.\n\n02:50.420 --> 02:52.340\n What are the important things about the hand?\n\n02:52.340 --> 02:55.220\n It seems like very useful for many things\n\n02:55.220 --> 02:57.420\n and it seems to be quite effective.\n\n02:57.420 --> 03:01.060\n A lot of people think the thumb is foundational\n\n03:01.060 --> 03:05.580\n to the human civilization.\n\n03:05.580 --> 03:07.220\n Is there any truth to that?\n\n03:07.220 --> 03:08.060\n I think that is true.\n\n03:08.060 --> 03:10.260\n Actually, one of the ways in which the importance\n\n03:10.260 --> 03:13.300\n of individual fingers comes to attention\n\n03:13.300 --> 03:15.780\n is when people have severe injuries to their fingers.\n\n03:15.780 --> 03:18.420\n For instance, I have a story in the book\n\n03:18.420 --> 03:21.220\n about a guy whose thumb is nearly ripped off\n\n03:21.220 --> 03:23.100\n by his dog's leash.\n\n03:23.100 --> 03:26.180\n And, you know, when plastic surgeons\n\n03:26.180 --> 03:27.740\n who are often the ones to repair that,\n\n03:27.740 --> 03:29.660\n sometimes it's orthopedic surgeons,\n\n03:29.660 --> 03:31.340\n they will debate, you know,\n\n03:31.340 --> 03:33.900\n how important is it to save this finger\n\n03:33.900 --> 03:36.020\n or how important is it to save, you know,\n\n03:36.020 --> 03:38.700\n let's say the kind of tip,\n\n03:38.700 --> 03:41.340\n the one third, the tip one third of one of your fingers.\n\n03:41.340 --> 03:43.140\n You know, it depends on the length that you'll lose.\n\n03:43.140 --> 03:44.740\n It depends on which finger.\n\n03:44.740 --> 03:47.980\n And so the thumb really is the most crucial,\n\n03:47.980 --> 03:50.620\n just, you know, for your occupation in most cases\n\n03:50.620 --> 03:54.060\n to just daily life and your ability to get around\n\n03:54.060 --> 03:55.220\n and take care of yourself and others.\n\n03:55.220 --> 03:57.540\n So, you know, there'll be more,\n\n03:57.540 --> 03:59.980\n they're willing to go further, do more surgeries,\n\n03:59.980 --> 04:03.340\n more aggressive therapy to save a thumb, let's say,\n\n04:03.340 --> 04:05.420\n than, you know, the tip of your pinky finger.\n\n04:05.420 --> 04:07.620\n So in that way, I do think the thumb, you know,\n\n04:07.620 --> 04:09.820\n does seem like the most important in many ways.\n\n04:09.820 --> 04:11.300\n It's nice that there's backups.\n\n04:11.300 --> 04:13.100\n I wonder if that's part of the future\n\n04:13.100 --> 04:15.940\n or is it just the symmetry that nature produces?\n\n04:15.940 --> 04:18.740\n You think the two hands is like,\n\n04:18.740 --> 04:21.460\n is it about the symmetry or is it about backup?\n\n04:21.460 --> 04:25.620\n We'd be much less formidable hunters, gatherers,\n\n04:25.620 --> 04:29.340\n survivors in any way if we only had one hand.\n\n04:29.340 --> 04:32.220\n So I think that is important to have two\n\n04:32.220 --> 04:34.820\n so we can, you know, even everything from kind of\n\n04:34.820 --> 04:36.940\n spearing an animal to firing a bow and arrow\n\n04:36.940 --> 04:37.820\n to butchering an animal.\n\n04:37.820 --> 04:40.340\n You really need two hands to do it very effectively.\n\n04:40.340 --> 04:43.140\n But can you do a better job with three?\n\n04:43.140 --> 04:44.780\n Great question.\n\n04:44.780 --> 04:48.700\n And we'll never know, perhaps.\n\n04:48.700 --> 04:51.500\n You tweeted, now I'm gonna analyze your tweets\n\n04:51.500 --> 04:53.140\n like it's Shakespeare sometimes.\n\n04:54.140 --> 04:56.180\n You tweeted that, quote, millions of years\n\n04:56.180 --> 04:59.220\n of sex and death design the human body.\n\n05:00.140 --> 05:01.620\n It's like poetry.\n\n05:01.620 --> 05:05.860\n Are those two basic activities basically summarize\n\n05:05.860 --> 05:09.100\n everything that resulted in humans on Earth?\n\n05:09.100 --> 05:13.820\n So like, is that a good summary of the evolutionary process\n\n05:13.820 --> 05:16.500\n that led to this conscious intelligent being,\n\n05:16.500 --> 05:19.220\n is death and sex?\n\n05:19.220 --> 05:20.300\n In a way, yeah.\n\n05:20.300 --> 05:23.500\n So sex is how more of us get made, obviously.\n\n05:23.500 --> 05:25.700\n And death is how we get weeded out\n\n05:25.700 --> 05:27.940\n or the gene pool gets weeded out\n\n05:27.940 --> 05:30.140\n and certain genes survive and others don't.\n\n05:30.140 --> 05:33.500\n And, you know, the age at which we die,\n\n05:33.500 --> 05:35.620\n whether it's before we've, you know,\n\n05:35.620 --> 05:38.620\n had sex and reproduced ourselves is a big factor\n\n05:38.620 --> 05:41.180\n and who survives, who doesn't, who passes on their genes\n\n05:41.180 --> 05:43.900\n and what the future of the body looks like.\n\n05:43.900 --> 05:46.340\n You know, who lived and who died\n\n05:46.340 --> 05:48.980\n before they were able to be at reproductive age\n\n05:48.980 --> 05:50.860\n a million years ago was pretty important\n\n05:50.860 --> 05:52.660\n in what we look like now.\n\n05:52.660 --> 05:55.820\n And perhaps how we have sex and die now\n\n05:55.820 --> 05:58.180\n will determine what we're shaped like\n\n05:58.180 --> 06:00.300\n unless technology has an even bigger role in that,\n\n06:00.300 --> 06:01.580\n you know, a million years from now.\n\n06:01.580 --> 06:02.860\n So you think that's fundamental\n\n06:02.860 --> 06:05.260\n to like if there's alien civilizations out there\n\n06:05.260 --> 06:07.740\n that have the same order of magnitude\n\n06:07.740 --> 06:09.460\n of intelligence or greater,\n\n06:09.460 --> 06:12.020\n do you think that we will see something like sex\n\n06:12.020 --> 06:13.820\n and something like death?\n\n06:13.820 --> 06:18.740\n So the reproducing and this selection process\n\n06:18.740 --> 06:23.260\n plus the weeding out of the old to make room for the new,\n\n06:23.260 --> 06:25.540\n is that kind of foundational to life?\n\n06:25.540 --> 06:26.380\n I would think so.\n\n06:26.380 --> 06:27.900\n I mean, it sure seems to be on earth,\n\n06:27.900 --> 06:29.860\n you know, perhaps in some distant future\n\n06:29.860 --> 06:33.300\n when medicine is nearing, you know, perfection\n\n06:33.300 --> 06:35.520\n and people can live a really long time.\n\n06:35.520 --> 06:39.060\n Maybe we won't even need to reproduce as much\n\n06:39.060 --> 06:41.060\n or something like that, you know,\n\n06:41.060 --> 06:43.780\n it's hard to even know what life will be like\n\n06:43.780 --> 06:44.620\n in the distant future.\n\n06:44.620 --> 06:46.900\n But I would guess that any alien civilization\n\n06:46.900 --> 06:50.100\n will have the same dependence on who has sex and who dies.\n\n06:50.100 --> 06:51.820\n Well, that's the problem with immortality.\n\n06:51.820 --> 06:55.980\n How are we going to clear out the old\n\n06:55.980 --> 06:59.260\n to make room for the new, which is kind of a,\n\n07:00.400 --> 07:03.420\n it's like a framework of adaptability\n\n07:03.420 --> 07:04.560\n to changing environments.\n\n07:04.560 --> 07:06.620\n So as long as the environment is changing,\n\n07:06.620 --> 07:09.140\n and it seems to always be,\n\n07:09.140 --> 07:11.340\n because the entirety of the earth system\n\n07:11.340 --> 07:14.140\n is a complex system, it seems like you have to adapt.\n\n07:14.140 --> 07:19.140\n And to adapt, you have to kill off the stubborn old ideas.\n\n07:19.500 --> 07:23.940\n And unless there's a way to like not become stubborn and old,\n\n07:23.940 --> 07:28.940\n but it feels like the nature of wisdom is stubborn and old.\n\n07:30.180 --> 07:32.160\n Like that's what wisdom is.\n\n07:32.160 --> 07:34.520\n It's like the lessons of life,\n\n07:34.520 --> 07:37.300\n the lessons of experience solidified.\n\n07:37.300 --> 07:39.420\n And the solidification is the thing\n\n07:39.420 --> 07:43.380\n that actually prevents you from reinventing yourself\n\n07:43.380 --> 07:47.320\n to adapt to the new changing conditions.\n\n07:47.320 --> 07:49.980\n But then again, why not have that both of those modes?\n\n07:49.980 --> 07:51.620\n Like have two minds and one person,\n\n07:51.620 --> 07:55.080\n one immortal person that like in the morning,\n\n07:55.080 --> 07:56.580\n they act like a teenager,\n\n07:56.580 --> 07:59.960\n in the evening they act like a old wise man.\n\n07:59.960 --> 08:00.900\n That's possible.\n\n08:00.900 --> 08:05.900\n So you see, you can imagine within one mind both modes,\n\n08:07.200 --> 08:08.380\n but those are required.\n\n08:08.380 --> 08:11.740\n You have to have the ability\n\n08:11.740 --> 08:13.800\n to completely reinvent yourself,\n\n08:13.800 --> 08:17.140\n which is what death does in an ugly way,\n\n08:18.600 --> 08:20.740\n or a beautiful way, depending on your perspective,\n\n08:20.740 --> 08:22.500\n depending whether you take the human perspective\n\n08:22.500 --> 08:25.020\n or the human, the nature's perspective.\n\n08:25.020 --> 08:27.060\n And then you have to have the selection.\n\n08:27.060 --> 08:30.500\n So competition, so sexual selection.\n\n08:30.500 --> 08:33.380\n It's an interesting, interesting little planet we got.\n\n08:33.380 --> 08:37.020\n What's the weirdest part, function, concept, idea\n\n08:37.020 --> 08:38.540\n about the human body to you?\n\n08:38.540 --> 08:40.640\n We'll talk about fascinating details,\n\n08:40.640 --> 08:45.640\n but I should say for people that should read your book,\n\n08:46.620 --> 08:48.940\n they will come face to face with the fact\n\n08:48.940 --> 08:51.380\n that you do not shy away from the weird\n\n08:51.380 --> 08:53.460\n and the wonderful of the human body.\n\n08:53.460 --> 08:57.540\n It's like, it's fun, but it's honest.\n\n08:57.540 --> 09:02.540\n So given that, sorry to make you pick one of your children,\n\n09:03.220 --> 09:06.580\n but what's the weirdest one, would you say?\n\n09:06.580 --> 09:09.080\n The weirdest body part.\n\n09:09.080 --> 09:12.460\n Or concept or function.\n\n09:12.460 --> 09:16.380\n So the chapters, you divide it up kind of into parts,\n\n09:16.380 --> 09:19.460\n but there could be a thread that connects all of them,\n\n09:19.460 --> 09:23.980\n the weirdness, maybe, or maybe the texture of the substance.\n\n09:23.980 --> 09:26.980\n It could be the liquids, the solids, I don't know.\n\n09:26.980 --> 09:29.220\n Definitely every body part and bodily fluid\n\n09:29.220 --> 09:33.000\n has their own kind of both gross and fascinating aspects.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.060\n That's probably why I'm a generalist as a doctor\n\n09:36.060 --> 09:38.700\n and couldn't just, as you said, pick one of my children,\n\n09:38.700 --> 09:41.000\n become a specialist, because I like them all.\n\n09:42.560 --> 09:44.980\n I feel like one of the strangest concepts\n\n09:44.980 --> 09:49.100\n about the human body is that kind of the aspects of it\n\n09:49.100 --> 09:51.620\n that are the most universal, that we all do,\n\n09:51.620 --> 09:54.400\n are the most taboo socially.\n\n09:54.400 --> 09:56.560\n I wouldn't have expected that if I had, you know,\n\n09:56.560 --> 09:58.700\n just looked from the outside, like what we do\n\n09:58.700 --> 10:00.940\n in the bathroom, what we do in the bedroom,\n\n10:00.940 --> 10:04.940\n what we do to our own genitals, what we do to our,\n\n10:04.940 --> 10:07.540\n you know, quote unquote, private parts, they're private,\n\n10:07.540 --> 10:10.340\n even though it's sort of the thing that we all have\n\n10:10.340 --> 10:13.500\n in common is the most we try to hide from other people\n\n10:13.500 --> 10:15.500\n and don't talk about in polite company.\n\n10:15.500 --> 10:17.820\n I mean, it makes sense as a human living in this society,\n\n10:17.820 --> 10:20.140\n but from the outside, it sort of might be surprising.\n\n10:20.140 --> 10:21.740\n How do you make sense of that if you put on\n\n10:21.740 --> 10:23.900\n your Sigmund Freud hat?\n\n10:23.900 --> 10:28.900\n The thing we all do, why do we make that a taboo thing?\n\n10:28.900 --> 10:30.860\n Is it because we like taboos?\n\n10:30.860 --> 10:35.720\n Maybe we get off, or maybe our kinks as humans\n\n10:35.720 --> 10:38.940\n is to have taboos, and it's kind of efficient\n\n10:38.940 --> 10:41.920\n to have taboos about the things that everybody does.\n\n10:41.920 --> 10:45.660\n Like, you can make walking taboo or something, I don't know.\n\n10:45.660 --> 10:48.300\n But just, maybe that's what we love,\n\n10:48.300 --> 10:52.220\n that's what's exciting to us, is the forbidden.\n\n10:52.220 --> 10:54.780\n I think, yes, society loves rules, for sure.\n\n10:54.780 --> 10:57.820\n They love, some societies more than others.\n\n10:57.820 --> 11:00.260\n You know, they love controlling how you think\n\n11:00.260 --> 11:02.700\n and what you do in public versus in private.\n\n11:02.700 --> 11:05.180\n You know, there's a lot of societies where, for instance,\n\n11:05.180 --> 11:07.140\n parents have sex in front of children.\n\n11:08.180 --> 11:10.900\n Not, you know, for instance, like in traditional\n\n11:10.900 --> 11:14.680\n Inupiat Eskimo societies, that was sort of normal.\n\n11:14.680 --> 11:15.580\n I mean, but what are you gonna do,\n\n11:15.580 --> 11:17.840\n go outside in the middle of the winter in the Arctic\n\n11:17.840 --> 11:18.760\n and do it out there?\n\n11:18.760 --> 11:19.600\n Of course not.\n\n11:19.600 --> 11:22.580\n So, you know, there's different taboos\n\n11:22.580 --> 11:23.780\n in different societies.\n\n11:23.780 --> 11:25.260\n Some taboos make perfect sense.\n\n11:25.260 --> 11:28.580\n Some taboos are even public health measures,\n\n11:28.580 --> 11:32.060\n you know, like, as I talk in the book about in India,\n\n11:32.060 --> 11:35.700\n where they, you know, the hands are symmetric, as you said,\n\n11:35.700 --> 11:38.500\n but in Indian culture, and the left hand is taboo,\n\n11:38.500 --> 11:41.780\n and the right hand is what you use for shaking hands,\n\n11:41.780 --> 11:44.100\n for eating, for other things, and the left hand\n\n11:44.100 --> 11:47.560\n is the dirty hand that you use for wiping your own bottom.\n\n11:47.560 --> 11:49.420\n You know, that's the toilet paper is your left hand.\n\n11:49.420 --> 11:52.780\n So, while the body is anatomically symmetric,\n\n11:52.780 --> 11:56.460\n the taboo creates this pretty intense asymmetry.\n\n11:56.460 --> 11:57.540\n But for a good reason, you know,\n\n11:57.540 --> 11:58.940\n yet you probably shouldn't be shaking hands\n\n11:58.940 --> 12:01.220\n with other people with the same hand that you use\n\n12:01.220 --> 12:02.240\n to kind of clean your bottom.\n\n12:02.240 --> 12:05.500\n So in that sense, it makes sense.\n\n12:05.500 --> 12:07.380\n Yeah, maybe the roots of it makes sense,\n\n12:07.380 --> 12:10.700\n but the way it propagates, especially as the times change,\n\n12:10.700 --> 12:13.320\n might not, because you can wash your hands.\n\n12:14.380 --> 12:16.200\n But the taboo remains.\n\n12:16.200 --> 12:19.160\n Right, society is very slow to change.\n\n12:19.160 --> 12:21.660\n What is the most fascinating part, function,\n\n12:21.660 --> 12:23.860\n or concept in the human body?\n\n12:23.860 --> 12:28.780\n So, you know, something that fills you with awe.\n\n12:30.420 --> 12:32.540\n I guess the most obvious one is the brain,\n\n12:32.540 --> 12:36.660\n partly because it's so, you know, sort of poorly understood,\n\n12:36.660 --> 12:39.740\n though we understand more than we ever have in the past.\n\n12:39.740 --> 12:41.580\n There's still so much that we don't understand\n\n12:41.580 --> 12:44.580\n about how the lump of matter in our skulls\n\n12:44.580 --> 12:46.620\n kind of creates this subjective experience\n\n12:46.620 --> 12:49.700\n that we all kind of understand quite viscerally.\n\n12:50.700 --> 12:51.580\n That's an easy one.\n\n12:51.580 --> 12:54.340\n I would say the kidneys are an underappreciated organ.\n\n12:55.620 --> 12:58.580\n The way they tinker with the bloodstream,\n\n12:58.580 --> 13:01.060\n raise levels of this, lower levels of that,\n\n13:01.060 --> 13:05.620\n kind of our entire lives from inside the womb until we die\n\n13:05.620 --> 13:07.500\n is just really incredible.\n\n13:07.500 --> 13:09.180\n And when you look at how much energy\n\n13:09.180 --> 13:10.540\n different organs consume,\n\n13:10.540 --> 13:13.440\n the brain and the kidneys are two of the biggest ones,\n\n13:13.440 --> 13:16.600\n because the brain obviously in us is always active,\n\n13:16.600 --> 13:17.980\n and controlling parts of the body,\n\n13:17.980 --> 13:21.040\n but the kidneys are just consuming a ton of energy\n\n13:21.040 --> 13:21.880\n to do what they do.\n\n13:21.880 --> 13:24.220\n They're kind of the unsung hero of the body,\n\n13:24.220 --> 13:26.060\n relegated to the back of the abdomen,\n\n13:26.060 --> 13:28.400\n like some forgotten organ, but they are great.\n\n13:28.400 --> 13:29.980\n I did consider being a nephrologist,\n\n13:29.980 --> 13:31.120\n which is a kidney specialist,\n\n13:31.120 --> 13:33.140\n because I was so taken with the kidneys,\n\n13:33.140 --> 13:35.240\n but decided I like all the organs,\n\n13:35.240 --> 13:36.540\n so couldn't pick just one.\n\n13:37.580 --> 13:40.540\n So your book is ordered in a particular way.\n\n13:40.540 --> 13:47.180\n It's throat, heart, feces, genitals, liver, pineal gland,\n\n13:47.180 --> 13:54.180\n brain, skin, urine, fat, lungs, eyes, mucus,\n\n13:54.180 --> 13:57.260\n fingers and toes, and blood.\n\n13:57.260 --> 13:58.100\n All right.\n\n13:59.060 --> 14:02.180\n First of all, great chapter titles.\n\n14:03.120 --> 14:06.500\n Is there a reason for this ordering, or is it all madness?\n\n14:06.500 --> 14:09.120\n There's a few different reasons that went into it.\n\n14:09.120 --> 14:13.740\n I did wanna start with the throat for the reason\n\n14:13.740 --> 14:18.100\n that it kind of presents the topic of death,\n\n14:18.100 --> 14:20.600\n which is sort of obviously very important\n\n14:20.600 --> 14:23.120\n in the training of a physician, in the career of physician.\n\n14:23.120 --> 14:25.580\n It's a big part of what I deal with.\n\n14:25.580 --> 14:27.900\n On the first day of medical school,\n\n14:27.900 --> 14:30.220\n we started the dissection of a cadaver\n\n14:30.220 --> 14:32.040\n in the class called anatomy lab.\n\n14:32.040 --> 14:34.940\n And so in a way, we were kind of thrown right in there\n\n14:34.940 --> 14:38.780\n in the beginning, like this is the end of the human story.\n\n14:38.780 --> 14:40.700\n Understand this, and then we sort of backed up\n\n14:40.700 --> 14:43.780\n to the beginning with embryology and reproduction and stuff.\n\n14:43.780 --> 14:47.060\n So it's kind of like we got, and I got thrown into that\n\n14:47.060 --> 14:48.820\n right away, right in the beginning,\n\n14:48.820 --> 14:50.260\n kind of like here's a dead body.\n\n14:50.260 --> 14:52.460\n Now start cutting it apart and learn the name\n\n14:52.460 --> 14:54.940\n and function of absolutely every bit of flesh.\n\n14:54.940 --> 14:58.480\n How did that change you, that first experience\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:01.740\n with the cold honesty of human biology?\n\n15:01.740 --> 15:02.940\n Right, that's exactly what it was,\n\n15:02.940 --> 15:05.220\n is cold honesty about kind of the story\n\n15:05.220 --> 15:06.740\n of each individual human body.\n\n15:06.740 --> 15:09.300\n It has an end, and that's it.\n\n15:09.300 --> 15:12.140\n I think that, well, actually before the end\n\n15:12.140 --> 15:14.360\n of that first day, so what we did on that first day\n\n15:14.360 --> 15:16.480\n was study the superficial muscles of the back,\n\n15:16.480 --> 15:19.420\n like the lats or latissimus dorsi and some other muscles.\n\n15:19.420 --> 15:21.420\n We cut through the skin of the back.\n\n15:21.420 --> 15:24.040\n My cadaver was laying face down on this metal gurney.\n\n15:24.040 --> 15:25.920\n We pulled back the kind of plastic sheets\n\n15:25.920 --> 15:28.340\n that would keep him moist for the next four months\n\n15:28.340 --> 15:31.140\n as we dissected him, cut through the skin on his back,\n\n15:31.140 --> 15:33.400\n and then started dissecting through the superficial muscles\n\n15:33.400 --> 15:34.240\n of the back.\n\n15:34.240 --> 15:36.540\n And that was really all we saw that first day.\n\n15:36.540 --> 15:38.700\n We didn't get any deeper, didn't enter the abdominal\n\n15:38.700 --> 15:41.460\n or chest cavity to see internal organs,\n\n15:41.460 --> 15:44.580\n but I was so fascinated with this sort of\n\n15:44.580 --> 15:48.060\n behind the scenes look at how things work in the body,\n\n15:48.060 --> 15:50.420\n how you move your arms, how you arch your back.\n\n15:50.420 --> 15:52.540\n You know, these are the muscles that do it\n\n15:52.540 --> 15:54.780\n that I decided I wanted to donate my own body\n\n15:54.780 --> 15:56.300\n for the same purpose.\n\n15:56.300 --> 15:57.980\n So I made that decision literally\n\n15:57.980 --> 16:00.180\n before the end of that first day of class,\n\n16:00.180 --> 16:02.980\n and I'm still sticking to it.\n\n16:02.980 --> 16:05.440\n So someday there'll be a medical student\n\n16:05.440 --> 16:09.340\n that can watch and listen to this podcast\n\n16:09.340 --> 16:11.480\n while dissecting your body.\n\n16:11.480 --> 16:12.320\n It could happen.\n\n16:12.320 --> 16:13.980\n They might not know that that person\n\n16:13.980 --> 16:15.220\n they're listening to on the podcast\n\n16:15.220 --> 16:17.140\n will be the carcass in front of them,\n\n16:17.140 --> 16:18.980\n but we never learned anything.\n\n16:18.980 --> 16:20.160\n The universe will know.\n\n16:20.160 --> 16:21.000\n The universe will know.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:24.780\n And they will acknowledge the irony or the humor,\n\n16:24.780 --> 16:26.500\n the absurdity of that.\n\n16:26.500 --> 16:27.780\n The universe will chuckle,\n\n16:27.780 --> 16:29.900\n but the medical student won't know\n\n16:29.900 --> 16:31.920\n because they never, as I did not,\n\n16:31.920 --> 16:35.740\n learn any personal information about the person,\n\n16:35.740 --> 16:37.780\n only what I could glean from looking inside them,\n\n16:37.780 --> 16:39.020\n which actually tells you quite a bit.\n\n16:39.020 --> 16:40.180\n I knew he was a smoker.\n\n16:40.180 --> 16:41.900\n I knew he had coronary artery disease.\n\n16:41.900 --> 16:44.020\n You know, you get a window into,\n\n16:44.020 --> 16:45.020\n I knew he was overweight.\n\n16:45.020 --> 16:46.680\n You get a window into people's lives\n\n16:46.680 --> 16:49.620\n just by looking in their bodies after death.\n\n16:49.620 --> 16:53.900\n Other cadavers in the lab, not my own,\n\n16:53.900 --> 16:55.880\n or I shared one with three other students,\n\n16:55.880 --> 16:58.980\n but other cadavers, some had metal joints,\n\n16:58.980 --> 17:00.100\n like a knee replacement.\n\n17:00.100 --> 17:01.480\n Some had a kidney missing.\n\n17:01.480 --> 17:02.900\n So they probably,\n\n17:02.900 --> 17:04.480\n and we could tell it was surgically removed,\n\n17:04.480 --> 17:07.020\n not that he was born with one.\n\n17:07.020 --> 17:08.980\n And we could tell that he probably had a kidney tumor\n\n17:08.980 --> 17:10.100\n or cancer that was removed.\n\n17:10.100 --> 17:12.580\n So you do get an insight into people's lives\n\n17:12.580 --> 17:16.060\n from picking them apart after they're dead,\n\n17:16.060 --> 17:17.260\n but you don't know their name\n\n17:17.260 --> 17:19.580\n or what podcast they've been on.\n\n17:19.580 --> 17:22.840\n So as the book title says, Unseen Body,\n\n17:23.780 --> 17:27.860\n so it tells some kind of story of your life.\n\n17:27.860 --> 17:30.900\n So it does capture the decisions you've made in your life,\n\n17:30.900 --> 17:32.460\n the things you've done,\n\n17:32.460 --> 17:37.460\n that might be kind of secret to that person\n\n17:37.500 --> 17:41.700\n and maybe to a few others that knew him or her well.\n\n17:41.700 --> 17:42.860\n It's so fascinating.\n\n17:42.860 --> 17:46.020\n So what kind of things can it reveal?\n\n17:46.020 --> 17:49.860\n Like what kind of choices in terms of the injuries,\n\n17:49.860 --> 17:53.420\n the catastrophic events,\n\n17:53.420 --> 17:56.900\n the lifestyle choices of smoking and diet\n\n17:56.900 --> 17:57.900\n and all those kinds of things?\n\n17:57.900 --> 17:59.820\n What can you see?\n\n17:59.820 --> 18:03.460\n What kind of history can you see about the human before you?\n\n18:03.460 --> 18:06.580\n So all those things you mentioned are things you can see.\n\n18:06.580 --> 18:08.220\n Take the skin, for example, right?\n\n18:08.220 --> 18:11.900\n Most things that happen to us leave a mark,\n\n18:11.900 --> 18:15.360\n as I say, kind of a story written in the language of scar\n\n18:15.360 --> 18:16.980\n where it tells you injuries you've had.\n\n18:16.980 --> 18:19.060\n And same thing with animals.\n\n18:19.060 --> 18:21.320\n I've seen deer hides that have marks\n\n18:21.320 --> 18:23.740\n that look like they're made by maybe a barbed wire fence,\n\n18:23.740 --> 18:24.580\n something like that.\n\n18:24.580 --> 18:27.900\n You can tell, sometimes it's conjecture,\n\n18:27.900 --> 18:30.060\n but you can sort of imagine what might've happened\n\n18:30.060 --> 18:30.900\n to cause that.\n\n18:30.900 --> 18:32.640\n Perhaps two bucks were fighting\n\n18:32.640 --> 18:34.780\n and one got injured with an antler.\n\n18:34.780 --> 18:36.460\n And the same with humans.\n\n18:36.460 --> 18:37.660\n I have scars on my body,\n\n18:37.660 --> 18:40.960\n and when I notice them, I remember what happened.\n\n18:40.960 --> 18:44.180\n I got a big cut on my hand when I was 13,\n\n18:44.180 --> 18:45.100\n and it's still there,\n\n18:45.100 --> 18:48.940\n and I remember what happened every time I look at it.\n\n18:48.940 --> 18:52.860\n And so in that way, only I might know that story,\n\n18:52.860 --> 18:54.820\n but other people, when they dissect me\n\n18:54.820 --> 18:56.060\n and notice the same scars,\n\n18:56.060 --> 18:58.100\n they can kind of, it can fire their imagination\n\n18:58.100 --> 19:00.140\n as my cadaver, you know, did for me.\n\n19:00.140 --> 19:02.780\n They know that there is a story there.\n\n19:02.780 --> 19:03.980\n That's such an interesting way\n\n19:03.980 --> 19:05.920\n that the skin does tell a story,\n\n19:07.020 --> 19:09.740\n both tattoos and scars.\n\n19:09.740 --> 19:10.580\n Right.\n\n19:10.580 --> 19:12.100\n Some of the fun you've had\n\n19:12.100 --> 19:14.140\n and some of the damage you've done.\n\n19:14.140 --> 19:14.980\n Right.\n\n19:14.980 --> 19:16.940\n And even when I evaluate a patient,\n\n19:16.940 --> 19:20.540\n I can use scars to help me make medical decisions.\n\n19:20.540 --> 19:22.820\n So for instance, someone that comes in with abdominal pain\n\n19:22.820 --> 19:24.280\n into the emergency room,\n\n19:24.280 --> 19:26.060\n you can see scars on their abdomen\n\n19:26.060 --> 19:27.420\n that tell you about, you know,\n\n19:27.420 --> 19:30.620\n the past kind of activities of a surgeon, perhaps.\n\n19:30.620 --> 19:33.420\n I know, I recognize the scars that are left\n\n19:33.420 --> 19:35.220\n when someone has their gallbladder removed,\n\n19:35.220 --> 19:37.460\n the scars when someone has their appendix removed,\n\n19:37.460 --> 19:38.940\n maybe when someone's had a hysterectomy,\n\n19:38.940 --> 19:42.380\n and that can tell you what it might be or what it isn't.\n\n19:42.380 --> 19:43.980\n You know, if someone doesn't have an appendix,\n\n19:43.980 --> 19:46.640\n their abdominal pain's not appendicitis, end of story.\n\n19:46.640 --> 19:49.740\n So in that way, I'm sort of looking at these,\n\n19:49.740 --> 19:52.740\n the tracks or the footprints of past surgeries\n\n19:52.740 --> 19:55.300\n to tell me what might and might not be the cause\n\n19:55.300 --> 19:56.480\n of this patient's abdominal pain,\n\n19:56.480 --> 19:58.220\n which is kind of my main job in the ER\n\n19:58.220 --> 20:00.660\n is figuring out what's causing it and to help them.\n\n20:01.660 --> 20:05.540\n Is there ways to get more data about the human body\n\n20:05.540 --> 20:08.760\n as we look into the future of medicine biology\n\n20:08.760 --> 20:11.260\n that will be helpful to fill in some of the gaps\n\n20:11.260 --> 20:12.680\n of the story?\n\n20:12.680 --> 20:17.120\n So, you know, you have companies,\n\n20:17.120 --> 20:20.580\n you have research that looks at, you know,\n\n20:20.580 --> 20:23.540\n collection of blood over long periods of time\n\n20:23.540 --> 20:26.780\n to see sort of, you know, paint the picture\n\n20:26.780 --> 20:28.120\n of what's happening in your body,\n\n20:28.120 --> 20:29.980\n mostly to help with lifestyle decisions,\n\n20:29.980 --> 20:33.500\n but also just, you know, to anticipate things\n\n20:33.500 --> 20:35.420\n that can go wrong and all that kind of stuff.\n\n20:35.420 --> 20:40.020\n Is there, can you just speak to a greater digital world\n\n20:40.020 --> 20:40.860\n that we're stepping in,\n\n20:40.860 --> 20:44.220\n how that can help tell a richer story?\n\n20:45.140 --> 20:48.740\n I certainly think that we have more data\n\n20:48.740 --> 20:50.380\n than we know what to do with right now,\n\n20:50.380 --> 20:54.300\n especially with kind of direct to consumer medical devices,\n\n20:54.300 --> 20:55.900\n you know, smartwatches, et cetera,\n\n20:55.900 --> 20:58.780\n that are just collecting these reams of data.\n\n20:58.780 --> 21:01.220\n I have not seen them put to,\n\n21:01.220 --> 21:04.220\n I think the eventual use that they will.\n\n21:04.220 --> 21:08.420\n I think that the potential is sort of just, you know,\n\n21:08.420 --> 21:11.700\n unimaginable and I hope we're heading into a new age\n\n21:11.700 --> 21:14.420\n where, you know, you can determine, for instance,\n\n21:14.420 --> 21:17.120\n is a person gonna have more of the dangerous side effects\n\n21:17.120 --> 21:19.140\n to a drug based on their genetics\n\n21:19.140 --> 21:22.800\n or are they gonna tolerate one drug better than the other,\n\n21:22.800 --> 21:24.620\n you know, based on their genetics?\n\n21:24.620 --> 21:27.760\n And we are slowly moving into that age\n\n21:27.760 --> 21:29.500\n and especially the age of kind of\n\n21:29.500 --> 21:32.560\n completely synthesizing drugs in the lab,\n\n21:34.080 --> 21:36.260\n you know, much like, for instance,\n\n21:36.260 --> 21:38.020\n some of the COVID vaccines actually,\n\n21:38.020 --> 21:41.140\n like Moderna never had the virus in their lab.\n\n21:41.140 --> 21:42.580\n They made that vaccine completely\n\n21:42.580 --> 21:44.180\n without ever having the virus themselves\n\n21:44.180 --> 21:46.580\n just by having the genome, which is sort of astounding.\n\n21:46.580 --> 21:49.260\n And there's a lot of potential going forward, you know,\n\n21:49.260 --> 21:51.180\n based on that technology and some others.\n\n21:51.180 --> 21:52.020\n Well, I didn't know that.\n\n21:52.020 --> 21:53.980\n So they basically, it's all in the computer,\n\n21:53.980 --> 21:54.980\n it's computational.\n\n21:54.980 --> 21:56.300\n Right, you have the genetic code,\n\n21:56.300 --> 21:57.580\n you have tremendous power,\n\n21:57.580 --> 21:59.900\n even if you don't have the organism itself.\n\n21:59.900 --> 22:04.660\n What do you make of Elizabeth Holmes and efforts like that?\n\n22:04.660 --> 22:09.100\n First of all, I'm a curious,\n\n22:11.840 --> 22:16.300\n I'm drawn to the darkness in human nature\n\n22:16.300 --> 22:18.380\n because that somehow reveals\n\n22:20.420 --> 22:23.180\n the full spectrum of what humans could be.\n\n22:23.180 --> 22:25.540\n So there's a lot of sort of controversial thoughts\n\n22:25.540 --> 22:28.620\n about who she is and her efforts and so on.\n\n22:28.620 --> 22:30.980\n I think you may have even tweeted about it,\n\n22:30.980 --> 22:33.980\n but I've read a lot of your tweets, so I'm now forgetting.\n\n22:33.980 --> 22:37.480\n But what do you make of her and both those efforts\n\n22:37.480 --> 22:42.480\n and the charlatans that sort of snake oil salesmen\n\n22:42.480 --> 22:47.480\n that promise those efforts to do more\n\n22:49.180 --> 22:50.380\n than they currently can?\n\n22:51.300 --> 22:55.020\n I think that her, you know, that goal that she had\n\n22:55.020 --> 22:58.000\n that she created Theranos to try to achieve,\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:01.500\n to use less blood in tests is a very worthy goal\n\n23:01.500 --> 23:04.780\n and a huge frontier that we have not achieved\n\n23:04.780 --> 23:06.240\n and that I hope we will achieve.\n\n23:06.240 --> 23:09.160\n So I understand why, you know,\n\n23:09.160 --> 23:12.200\n someone describes what a huge step forward that would be\n\n23:12.200 --> 23:13.180\n and it would be indeed.\n\n23:13.180 --> 23:15.660\n I understand why people put a ton of money behind it.\n\n23:15.660 --> 23:17.860\n Can you describe what was the promise?\n\n23:17.860 --> 23:20.540\n What are we even talking about with Theranos,\n\n23:20.540 --> 23:22.340\n just for people who don't know?\n\n23:22.340 --> 23:25.580\n So Theranos is a company that was basically started\n\n23:25.580 --> 23:29.700\n to revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done,\n\n23:29.700 --> 23:33.020\n both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it.\n\n23:33.020 --> 23:34.820\n You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor\n\n23:34.820 --> 23:37.600\n and had five to 10 tubes of blood removed from them,\n\n23:37.600 --> 23:41.460\n it can be quite surprising how much they take out.\n\n23:41.460 --> 23:45.080\n And it's, you know, that's the limitation of our technology\n\n23:45.080 --> 23:46.460\n that we need those volumes of blood\n\n23:46.460 --> 23:47.860\n to run all the tests that we want to.\n\n23:47.860 --> 23:50.560\n And so the promise of Theranos was that perhaps\n\n23:50.560 --> 23:53.140\n with a single drop of blood, we would be able to know\n\n23:53.140 --> 23:57.380\n as much about the person's, the condition of their body\n\n23:57.380 --> 24:00.060\n without drawing all that blood and thereby, you know,\n\n24:00.060 --> 24:02.500\n there would be these devices she was gonna create\n\n24:02.500 --> 24:03.800\n that would sort of do it.\n\n24:03.800 --> 24:05.700\n You put a drop of blood in and it spits out everything\n\n24:05.700 --> 24:07.560\n you ever wanted to know about what's in your bloodstream.\n\n24:07.560 --> 24:09.940\n And in a way that would make it so much easier,\n\n24:09.940 --> 24:11.860\n you know, it could be, you could have one in your home\n\n24:11.860 --> 24:14.300\n theoretically, and you, I don't know why you'd wonder\n\n24:14.300 --> 24:16.240\n what your potassium level is on any given day,\n\n24:16.240 --> 24:18.140\n but you could check if you wanted to.\n\n24:19.020 --> 24:21.340\n And so that goal is very worthy.\n\n24:21.340 --> 24:25.500\n You know, I put that goal up there with the frontier\n\n24:25.500 --> 24:27.620\n of making painkillers that are as good as opioids\n\n24:27.620 --> 24:28.920\n without the addictive quality.\n\n24:28.920 --> 24:30.700\n You know, that would be such a huge revolution\n\n24:30.700 --> 24:32.140\n if we did have that in medicine.\n\n24:32.140 --> 24:34.460\n But, and particularly for me,\n\n24:34.460 --> 24:37.460\n cause I trained in both pediatrics and internal medicine.\n\n24:37.460 --> 24:40.300\n So I learned to care for both children and adults.\n\n24:40.300 --> 24:42.180\n In children, we do draw much less blood.\n\n24:42.180 --> 24:43.900\n They have a much lower blood volume.\n\n24:43.900 --> 24:47.400\n And we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood.\n\n24:47.400 --> 24:50.040\n And we seemingly get equivalent information\n\n24:50.040 --> 24:52.220\n out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.\n\n24:52.220 --> 24:53.660\n And I'm still unclear to be honest,\n\n24:53.660 --> 24:56.340\n why we can't draw that little amount of blood from adults.\n\n24:56.340 --> 24:58.260\n It seems technically possible.\n\n24:58.260 --> 24:59.440\n I don't know what the barriers are.\n\n24:59.440 --> 25:02.260\n I'm sure there are, or else we'd be doing it.\n\n25:02.260 --> 25:04.860\n But I do think that that is a very important goal.\n\n25:04.860 --> 25:06.100\n And if Theranos had done it,\n\n25:06.100 --> 25:09.000\n it would have really revolutionized the practice of medicine.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:13.900\n So to return to that cadaver,\n\n25:13.900 --> 25:18.300\n that first day when you got to meet with the dead,\n\n25:18.300 --> 25:21.100\n with a human body that's no longer living.\n\n25:21.100 --> 25:26.100\n So how quickly did it take for you to get used to sort of,\n\n25:27.900 --> 25:31.000\n you said, looking at the surface muscles of the back?\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:34.980\n I mean, that can be overwhelming as a thought.\n\n25:34.980 --> 25:37.460\n And people listening to this that have never dissected\n\n25:37.460 --> 25:40.180\n anything might be overwhelmed by that thought.\n\n25:40.180 --> 25:43.620\n So like, how quickly were you able to get used\n\n25:43.620 --> 25:48.500\n to the brutal honesty of the biology before you?\n\n25:48.500 --> 25:50.260\n For me, it did not take long at all.\n\n25:50.260 --> 25:53.060\n I guess I've never been a squeamish person.\n\n25:53.060 --> 25:55.820\n So for me, it was kind of riveting and fascinating\n\n25:55.820 --> 25:56.960\n right from the first moment.\n\n25:56.960 --> 26:00.240\n But I do know some of my fellow classmates\n\n26:00.240 --> 26:01.780\n did have some trouble with it.\n\n26:01.780 --> 26:05.740\n Some of them I heard had nightmares in the first few weeks\n\n26:05.740 --> 26:08.060\n of anatomy lab.\n\n26:08.060 --> 26:10.620\n But then everyone, as far as I know, got used to it.\n\n26:10.620 --> 26:13.500\n And that was also actually a big lesson for me\n\n26:13.500 --> 26:15.860\n that it's pretty amazing what people can get used to\n\n26:15.860 --> 26:16.700\n in their daily lives.\n\n26:16.700 --> 26:20.180\n And I kind of extrapolated that to people living through war\n\n26:20.180 --> 26:23.220\n and through just terrible situations\n\n26:23.220 --> 26:26.860\n and living under oppressive regimes.\n\n26:26.860 --> 26:30.060\n And it really is amazing what people can get used to,\n\n26:30.060 --> 26:31.500\n almost anything.\n\n26:31.500 --> 26:35.740\n Well, you know, in war, people often come back\n\n26:35.740 --> 26:37.300\n and they have nightmares.\n\n26:37.300 --> 26:38.220\n They suffer through it.\n\n26:38.220 --> 26:39.140\n There's PTSD.\n\n26:39.140 --> 26:42.260\n There's a lot of complicated feelings with that.\n\n26:43.880 --> 26:47.760\n Are echoes of those same complicated feelings possible\n\n26:47.760 --> 26:50.900\n in the case of training to be and becoming a doctor?\n\n26:51.960 --> 26:52.800\n That's a good point.\n\n26:52.800 --> 26:56.340\n Yeah, I think sometimes, just as a barbed wire fence\n\n26:56.340 --> 26:58.580\n can leave a scar on your skin,\n\n26:58.580 --> 27:01.040\n emotional, psychological experiences\n\n27:01.040 --> 27:03.860\n can leave a mark on your brain or your memory.\n\n27:03.860 --> 27:08.860\n And I think that that definitely could be a problem\n\n27:09.740 --> 27:10.760\n in medical training.\n\n27:10.760 --> 27:14.180\n You do see a lot of things that are very shocking,\n\n27:14.180 --> 27:17.000\n very repulsive, things that you'd never forget.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:20.020\n I know one of those students that had nightmares initially\n\n27:20.020 --> 27:21.460\n went on to be a surgeon.\n\n27:21.460 --> 27:23.820\n So I imagine she's not having the PTSD\n\n27:23.820 --> 27:25.980\n of kind of seeing inside her first dead body\n\n27:25.980 --> 27:28.580\n because she sees inside them all day, every day now.\n\n27:28.580 --> 27:30.180\n But I'm sure it could.\n\n27:30.180 --> 27:34.380\n You know, we go on to see so many kind of grosser\n\n27:34.380 --> 27:37.160\n or more shocking things in medical training\n\n27:37.160 --> 27:38.620\n through medical school and then by working\n\n27:38.620 --> 27:40.460\n with actual living patients,\n\n27:40.460 --> 27:43.540\n not just dead and embalmed bodies.\n\n27:43.540 --> 27:46.640\n So I do think that things can leave a mark,\n\n27:46.640 --> 27:48.980\n but I don't think that initial cadaver\n\n27:48.980 --> 27:50.420\n would be the most traumatic.\n\n27:51.880 --> 27:54.580\n Yeah, but maybe some of that trauma,\n\n27:54.580 --> 27:56.980\n the demons make you a better surgeon,\n\n27:56.980 --> 28:00.540\n just like some of your own psychological trauma\n\n28:00.540 --> 28:03.100\n might make you a better psychiatrist.\n\n28:03.100 --> 28:07.960\n Returning to the ordering, is it order or is it chaos\n\n28:07.960 --> 28:11.620\n to the ordering of the chapters from throat and heart\n\n28:12.480 --> 28:14.340\n and feces and genitals all the way\n\n28:14.340 --> 28:15.860\n to fingers and toes and blood?\n\n28:16.740 --> 28:18.500\n So I did mention that, you know,\n\n28:18.500 --> 28:20.340\n throat was the first one because I kind of wanted\n\n28:20.340 --> 28:24.540\n to throw the reader right into the brutal honesty of death.\n\n28:24.540 --> 28:27.220\n And I followed it up with feces as the third chapter\n\n28:27.220 --> 28:30.220\n and in a way, partly to also throw them right\n\n28:30.220 --> 28:33.980\n into the deep end of how I like discussing parts\n\n28:33.980 --> 28:36.340\n of the body and revealing their gross\n\n28:36.340 --> 28:37.860\n and fascinating aspects.\n\n28:37.860 --> 28:39.620\n So I didn't want to hide anything.\n\n28:39.620 --> 28:41.220\n You know, when you train to be a doctor,\n\n28:41.220 --> 28:44.500\n everything is on the table, literally in the cadaver lab,\n\n28:44.500 --> 28:46.860\n but also just, you know, you deal with blood\n\n28:46.860 --> 28:48.780\n and piss and vomit and feces.\n\n28:48.780 --> 28:51.240\n And that's kind of the medium of your craft.\n\n28:51.240 --> 28:55.300\n And yes, the medium of the craft, that's right.\n\n28:55.300 --> 28:58.840\n Like if you're a painter, this is the paint.\n\n29:00.180 --> 29:01.020\n Exactly.\n\n29:01.020 --> 29:03.340\n And then you have to create a masterpiece with it.\n\n29:04.500 --> 29:06.860\n Like almost like a dance because there's multiple painters.\n\n29:06.860 --> 29:08.860\n One of the painters is the biology.\n\n29:08.860 --> 29:10.360\n So let's return to throat.\n\n29:10.360 --> 29:12.020\n You mentioned it's a weird one.\n\n29:12.020 --> 29:14.740\n So first of all, a friend of mine said,\n\n29:14.740 --> 29:19.620\n I just see humans as like a bunch of holes\n\n29:19.620 --> 29:21.520\n that just walk around.\n\n29:24.060 --> 29:24.900\n Not untrue.\n\n29:25.820 --> 29:27.440\n It's a funny way to look at humans.\n\n29:27.440 --> 29:31.700\n So we have ears, we have nose, we have mouth,\n\n29:31.700 --> 29:36.700\n we have the sexual holes, vagina, penis.\n\n29:36.980 --> 29:40.540\n And then, you know, what's the medical term\n\n29:40.540 --> 29:41.760\n for your asshole?\n\n29:42.700 --> 29:43.540\n Anus.\n\n29:43.540 --> 29:44.360\n Anus, thank you.\n\n29:45.500 --> 29:47.220\n This is a very technical discussion.\n\n29:47.220 --> 29:49.740\n The rectum's further in, don't confuse the two.\n\n29:49.740 --> 29:51.620\n Oh, that's very important.\n\n29:51.620 --> 29:54.020\n Is there a difference between throat and mouth?\n\n29:54.020 --> 29:56.100\n By the way, so when you say throat,\n\n29:56.100 --> 30:00.900\n are we talking about when that hole actually becomes tubular?\n\n30:00.900 --> 30:03.640\n The throat I would count as just sort of the very back\n\n30:03.640 --> 30:07.780\n of the back of the mouth, where the nose also comes down\n\n30:07.780 --> 30:10.480\n and meets it, where the tonsils are and the uvula.\n\n30:11.460 --> 30:13.240\n But you're right that we are a bunch of holes.\n\n30:13.240 --> 30:15.180\n But more accurately, we're a tube, right?\n\n30:15.180 --> 30:18.620\n We start in the womb as kind of this microscopic little disc,\n\n30:18.620 --> 30:21.980\n almost like a flatbread.\n\n30:21.980 --> 30:25.980\n And then we roll almost like a burrito into this tube.\n\n30:25.980 --> 30:27.660\n And we're a simple microscopic tube.\n\n30:27.660 --> 30:30.220\n And from there, we grow into this bigger and bigger tube\n\n30:30.220 --> 30:32.180\n and we become more complicated.\n\n30:32.180 --> 30:35.140\n And each end of the tube does split into various holes.\n\n30:35.140 --> 30:37.180\n So all the holes you mentioned at the front end of the tube,\n\n30:37.180 --> 30:38.380\n the front end of our body, right?\n\n30:38.380 --> 30:42.340\n It splits into the nose, the mouth, the ears, the sinuses,\n\n30:42.340 --> 30:46.060\n the tube to the lungs, which is the windpipe,\n\n30:46.060 --> 30:48.780\n the tube down to the stomach, which is the esophagus.\n\n30:48.780 --> 30:51.860\n And then the other end of the tube splits as well.\n\n30:51.860 --> 30:55.600\n Men end up with two holes and women end up with three holes.\n\n30:56.760 --> 30:59.620\n The urethra, the vagina, and the anus, and men.\n\n30:59.620 --> 31:02.380\n The urethra and kind of the reproductive system,\n\n31:02.380 --> 31:03.380\n they share a hole.\n\n31:03.380 --> 31:05.860\n So I'm learning a lot today.\n\n31:05.860 --> 31:10.200\n It really is incredible that you start from a sperm and an egg\n\n31:10.200 --> 31:12.380\n and you have some DNA information.\n\n31:12.380 --> 31:15.540\n And from that, the building project begins.\n\n31:15.540 --> 31:20.540\n And then what that leads to is like pizza dough\n\n31:20.900 --> 31:24.120\n and then you roll it into a tube.\n\n31:24.120 --> 31:29.120\n And that tube then eventually sort of becomes\n\n31:29.460 --> 31:34.460\n more and more complicated and gets eyes and a brain\n\n31:34.660 --> 31:38.500\n and then can create a Twitter account.\n\n31:38.500 --> 31:43.500\n So it's really incredible that we're just a fancy tube.\n\n31:43.620 --> 31:44.620\n Right, we are.\n\n31:44.620 --> 31:48.200\n And we sprout eyes and a brain and a sense of smell\n\n31:48.200 --> 31:50.820\n and taste pretty much to regulate what comes in\n\n31:50.820 --> 31:52.220\n the front of the tube.\n\n31:52.220 --> 31:55.300\n We don't wanna eat anything dangerous or poisonous.\n\n31:55.300 --> 31:58.500\n We wanna choose what we eat, even choose who we kiss.\n\n31:58.500 --> 32:01.140\n Well, we seem to be motivated by what comes out\n\n32:01.140 --> 32:04.020\n of the tube as well in part.\n\n32:04.020 --> 32:07.900\n That's not just output, it's a feedback mechanism seemingly.\n\n32:07.900 --> 32:11.100\n Like we're also monitoring the functioning of the output.\n\n32:11.100 --> 32:13.100\n We're not just obsessed about the input.\n\n32:14.300 --> 32:15.700\n We're very obsessed with the output.\n\n32:15.700 --> 32:17.940\n You're absolutely right about that.\n\n32:17.940 --> 32:21.460\n People have medical complaints about their output\n\n32:21.460 --> 32:24.880\n very often that are, I never cease to be surprised\n\n32:24.880 --> 32:28.060\n by a new kind of complaint or observation about the output.\n\n32:28.060 --> 32:32.360\n I think people have gone to wars over the output\n\n32:32.360 --> 32:35.020\n and maybe sometimes the lack of the output\n\n32:35.020 --> 32:38.580\n or the desire for output for the particular other humans\n\n32:39.460 --> 32:44.380\n that you fancy, the brain and the eyes that sprouted\n\n32:44.380 --> 32:48.140\n somehow convinced the rest of the body\n\n32:48.140 --> 32:51.820\n that this one particular other tube is fanciful.\n\n32:51.820 --> 32:53.440\n So you're going to go to major wars\n\n32:53.440 --> 32:57.460\n and lead global suffering because of the fancy\n\n32:57.460 --> 33:01.660\n and the desire for additional output with the other tube.\n\n33:01.660 --> 33:06.660\n Okay, so on the throat, that part of the tube,\n\n33:09.500 --> 33:13.580\n is it, you said the design is not,\n\n33:13.580 --> 33:16.260\n you could have thought of maybe a little bit better options\n\n33:16.260 --> 33:18.340\n because it's too multifunctional.\n\n33:18.340 --> 33:20.820\n Is that, can you sort of elaborate\n\n33:20.820 --> 33:23.780\n on the multifunctional nature of this part?\n\n33:23.780 --> 33:26.460\n Are a lot of parts of the human body multifunctional\n\n33:26.460 --> 33:29.500\n or do you find that more specialization\n\n33:29.500 --> 33:32.260\n is going to get the job done better?\n\n33:32.260 --> 33:34.060\n There is a lot of organs, for instance,\n\n33:34.060 --> 33:35.780\n do have multiple functions.\n\n33:35.780 --> 33:39.540\n The pancreas is like two organs in one.\n\n33:39.540 --> 33:42.460\n One secretes hormones like insulin into the bloodstream\n\n33:42.460 --> 33:45.940\n and the other aspect of it secretes digestive enzymes\n\n33:45.940 --> 33:49.180\n into the gut to help you digest and absorb food.\n\n33:49.180 --> 33:51.060\n The liver is like 15 organs in one.\n\n33:51.060 --> 33:53.840\n It's just amazing how many different things it does.\n\n33:53.840 --> 33:57.500\n But the throat, so basically the problem with the throat\n\n33:57.500 --> 33:59.940\n is as I said, we have two tubes\n\n33:59.940 --> 34:01.880\n that are right next to each other in the throat.\n\n34:01.880 --> 34:05.420\n One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,\n\n34:05.420 --> 34:07.120\n whatever you're gonna swallow,\n\n34:07.120 --> 34:09.300\n all of that stuff must go down the esophagus,\n\n34:09.300 --> 34:11.460\n the food tube and end up in the stomach.\n\n34:11.460 --> 34:14.460\n And right next to the esophagus millimeters away\n\n34:14.460 --> 34:16.340\n is the windpipe or the trachea,\n\n34:16.340 --> 34:18.420\n which goes down to the lungs.\n\n34:18.420 --> 34:21.900\n And your throat does these daily gymnastics\n\n34:21.900 --> 34:26.360\n to keep everything but air out of the windpipe\n\n34:26.360 --> 34:30.240\n because you slip up once and you can die.\n\n34:30.240 --> 34:32.820\n You can choke, you laugh or speak while eating\n\n34:32.820 --> 34:35.100\n and it's curtains, unfortunately.\n\n34:35.100 --> 34:37.400\n So it seems like every aspect of the body\n\n34:37.400 --> 34:38.820\n when I was learning about it in med school\n\n34:38.820 --> 34:42.660\n seemed so brilliant and so perfectly designed\n\n34:42.660 --> 34:45.500\n by evolution or whoever you might think designed it\n\n34:46.340 --> 34:50.560\n to favor survival, to enhance life,\n\n34:51.660 --> 34:53.700\n but the throat seemed the opposite.\n\n34:53.700 --> 34:56.700\n It seemed set up almost for failure.\n\n34:56.700 --> 35:00.380\n And we developed all these mechanisms as a compensation.\n\n35:00.380 --> 35:04.020\n We have the gag reflex whenever food or something\n\n35:04.020 --> 35:07.100\n is headed towards your air pipe, your windpipe\n\n35:07.100 --> 35:08.140\n or down to your lungs,\n\n35:08.140 --> 35:10.660\n your throat has this sort of like rejection of it.\n\n35:10.660 --> 35:13.180\n It pushes it away in a gag reflex.\n\n35:13.180 --> 35:14.480\n At the same time, we have a cough,\n\n35:14.480 --> 35:16.380\n which is something our body does\n\n35:16.380 --> 35:19.060\n when something inappropriate does get down the windpipe.\n\n35:19.060 --> 35:22.260\n When we get a little food down the wrong pipe,\n\n35:22.260 --> 35:24.780\n we end up coughing and the coughing does\n\n35:24.780 --> 35:27.340\n usually flush it out and get rid of it.\n\n35:27.340 --> 35:29.940\n We even have something called the mucus elevator\n\n35:29.940 --> 35:33.740\n in our lungs, which is this constant flow of mucus\n\n35:33.740 --> 35:36.700\n up the airways, up to the trachea, dragging with it\n\n35:36.700 --> 35:38.780\n all kinds of particulates that we've inhaled\n\n35:38.780 --> 35:41.220\n and perhaps some food that went down the wrong pipe\n\n35:41.220 --> 35:44.260\n and drags it up into the throat and we swallow it\n\n35:44.260 --> 35:47.120\n kind of unconsciously all day, every day is the truth.\n\n35:47.120 --> 35:50.140\n Even the mechanism of swallowing is super complicated.\n\n35:50.140 --> 35:52.260\n It uses a number of cranial nerves.\n\n35:52.260 --> 35:54.680\n It uses over 15 different muscles.\n\n35:55.540 --> 36:00.340\n It's this coordinated act to keep food out of the airway.\n\n36:00.340 --> 36:02.420\n You can see someone's Adam's apple in their neck\n\n36:02.420 --> 36:05.160\n kind of jump upward when they swallow,\n\n36:05.160 --> 36:09.240\n which helps lift the airway up against the epiglottis,\n\n36:09.240 --> 36:13.000\n which plugs it closed and allows food or swallow drink\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.020\n to kind of skirt just past it.\n\n36:15.020 --> 36:17.500\n But every time we swallow, those things do come\n\n36:17.500 --> 36:19.780\n within millimeters of going down the wrong pipe\n\n36:19.780 --> 36:22.420\n and it's just thanks to these kind of compensations,\n\n36:22.420 --> 36:25.020\n these adaptations we have to the danger of the throat\n\n36:25.020 --> 36:26.200\n that keeps us alive.\n\n36:27.300 --> 36:30.380\n As I actually took a sip of water,\n\n36:30.380 --> 36:34.260\n it's kind of, it makes you appreciate\n\n36:34.260 --> 36:36.020\n the wonderful machinery of it all.\n\n36:36.960 --> 36:39.560\n By the way, we have pulled up your Instagram\n\n36:39.560 --> 36:41.060\n that people should follow.\n\n36:41.060 --> 36:44.100\n You have a post about the throat\n\n36:44.100 --> 36:47.620\n and just showing so many different components\n\n36:47.620 --> 36:52.320\n from the tongue to the trachea, the esophagus,\n\n36:52.320 --> 36:54.760\n just the entire machinery of it all.\n\n36:56.460 --> 37:00.420\n The teeth for the chewing, it's so interesting.\n\n37:00.420 --> 37:02.780\n And so a lot of the structure of this,\n\n37:02.780 --> 37:05.460\n the anatomy and the physiology,\n\n37:05.460 --> 37:07.900\n does it echo other mammals?\n\n37:07.900 --> 37:11.300\n Are we just basically borrowing a lot of stuff\n\n37:11.300 --> 37:14.460\n from evolution and maybe making small adjustments\n\n37:14.460 --> 37:17.260\n maybe due to the fact that we're not using our mouth\n\n37:17.260 --> 37:21.560\n to murder things as other predators might?\n\n37:22.460 --> 37:23.740\n We use our thumbs.\n\n37:23.740 --> 37:26.780\n Exactly, we have hands, we don't need to bite them.\n\n37:26.780 --> 37:29.780\n Yeah, there's a lot of overlap between different animals\n\n37:29.780 --> 37:32.900\n which I find very comforting and fascinating.\n\n37:32.900 --> 37:34.660\n Someone asked me, is there any animal\n\n37:34.660 --> 37:36.620\n in which the throat is better designed?\n\n37:36.620 --> 37:38.500\n And my first thought was whales\n\n37:38.500 --> 37:40.700\n because the blowhole's kind of up on the top of their head.\n\n37:40.700 --> 37:44.220\n So I was thinking, oh, maybe they are more separate.\n\n37:44.220 --> 37:46.140\n But when I looked into it, actually no,\n\n37:46.140 --> 37:48.900\n the paths do come very close, just like in us.\n\n37:48.900 --> 37:53.220\n And I saw a paper about some new discovered organ\n\n37:53.220 --> 37:55.300\n that actually helps keep food and drink\n\n37:55.300 --> 37:56.700\n out of the airway in whales\n\n37:56.700 --> 37:58.220\n that they hadn't ever noticed before.\n\n37:58.220 --> 37:59.940\n So it's a different mechanism,\n\n37:59.940 --> 38:02.940\n but the same kind of basic problem is that\n\n38:02.940 --> 38:05.060\n we're tubes and the air tube and food tube\n\n38:05.060 --> 38:06.500\n are right next to each other.\n\n38:06.500 --> 38:07.940\n How well do we understand,\n\n38:07.940 --> 38:10.340\n so just even linger on this little part,\n\n38:10.340 --> 38:13.140\n is there still mysteries about the complexity\n\n38:13.140 --> 38:13.980\n of the system?\n\n38:13.980 --> 38:16.380\n You mentioned just even for swallowing\n\n38:16.380 --> 38:18.500\n all these parts in the brain that are responsible\n\n38:18.500 --> 38:20.700\n and all the different things that have to,\n\n38:20.700 --> 38:22.740\n like an orchestra play together.\n\n38:22.740 --> 38:26.300\n Do we have a good sense from both a medical perspective\n\n38:26.300 --> 38:29.060\n and a biology perspective or is there still mysteries?\n\n38:29.060 --> 38:30.420\n There's definitely still mysteries.\n\n38:30.420 --> 38:32.440\n We understand a lot about, for instance,\n\n38:32.440 --> 38:35.860\n how the swallowing mechanism is coordinated\n\n38:35.860 --> 38:37.140\n in the brainstem,\n\n38:37.140 --> 38:40.100\n sometimes using some higher levels of the brain,\n\n38:40.100 --> 38:42.020\n but it is a very thoughtless thing\n\n38:42.020 --> 38:44.020\n as you mentioned when you drank the water.\n\n38:44.020 --> 38:45.840\n It's not something we have to think about, thankfully,\n\n38:45.840 --> 38:47.740\n or we'd be thinking about it all day.\n\n38:49.080 --> 38:50.140\n There's a lot we don't understand\n\n38:50.140 --> 38:51.440\n about the basic mechanisms,\n\n38:51.440 --> 38:53.980\n perhaps about how the nerves fire\n\n38:53.980 --> 38:58.280\n and how they kind of coordinate on the microscopic level,\n\n38:58.280 --> 39:01.260\n how ions rush into and out of nerve cells\n\n39:01.260 --> 39:03.200\n to kind of create that electrical signal,\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:05.700\n but we sure understand a heck of a lot\n\n39:05.700 --> 39:07.020\n and it's very fascinating.\n\n39:07.020 --> 39:12.020\n So, moving on to chapter two and we'll jump around.\n\n39:12.100 --> 39:17.100\n And you actually said the liver does a lot of things.\n\n39:17.180 --> 39:19.580\n I also saw you retweet something\n\n39:21.100 --> 39:23.420\n where it said, you know,\n\n39:23.420 --> 39:25.900\n showing that the liver is bigger than the heart,\n\n39:25.900 --> 39:28.980\n which is the body or the universe's way of saying\n\n39:28.980 --> 39:31.140\n you should drink more and care less,\n\n39:31.140 --> 39:32.740\n which is a good line.\n\n39:32.740 --> 39:37.500\n So, you give props, like you said, to the kidney,\n\n39:37.500 --> 39:40.580\n to the liver, to the maybe, to the organs,\n\n39:40.580 --> 39:44.020\n to the parts that don't often get as much credit\n\n39:44.020 --> 39:48.340\n as they deserve, but let us go for time to the human heart.\n\n39:50.260 --> 39:51.640\n We get chest pain.\n\n39:52.820 --> 39:55.660\n We talk about it when we talk about love for some reason.\n\n39:55.660 --> 39:58.660\n Why do we talk about the heart when we talk about love?\n\n39:58.660 --> 40:00.060\n There sometimes can actually be\n\n40:00.060 --> 40:01.820\n some chest pain involved in love.\n\n40:01.820 --> 40:03.740\n I remember when I was a med student,\n\n40:03.740 --> 40:06.780\n I was very smitten with another medical student\n\n40:06.780 --> 40:09.260\n who was totally brilliant and beautiful.\n\n40:09.260 --> 40:10.620\n And it actually does cause\n\n40:10.620 --> 40:12.540\n this kind of burning in your chest.\n\n40:12.540 --> 40:13.900\n I don't know what that is.\n\n40:13.900 --> 40:16.020\n I don't think it's from the heart itself.\n\n40:16.020 --> 40:17.740\n I don't know if it was like acid reflux\n\n40:17.740 --> 40:18.580\n because I was so nervous.\n\n40:18.580 --> 40:20.020\n I'm not really sure,\n\n40:20.020 --> 40:22.500\n but I definitely felt something in my chest\n\n40:22.500 --> 40:23.660\n whenever I saw her.\n\n40:23.660 --> 40:24.700\n I don't know what that is,\n\n40:24.700 --> 40:26.740\n but you could see why someone might think,\n\n40:26.740 --> 40:28.140\n oh, you know, maybe it is your heart.\n\n40:28.140 --> 40:30.620\n That's kind of the most prominent organ in your chest.\n\n40:30.620 --> 40:32.380\n When people come to the ER with chest pain,\n\n40:32.380 --> 40:33.940\n the big question is, is it my heart?\n\n40:33.940 --> 40:36.900\n And that's my main job is figuring out if it is or not.\n\n40:36.900 --> 40:38.120\n So I could see why.\n\n40:39.460 --> 40:42.260\n The way ancients saw the functions of different organs\n\n40:42.260 --> 40:46.300\n is fascinating, but often hard to explain.\n\n40:46.300 --> 40:48.380\n Would it be fair to say\n\n40:48.380 --> 40:51.100\n that if you look at the entirety of human history,\n\n40:51.100 --> 40:55.460\n the way most people die has to do with the heart?\n\n40:55.460 --> 40:58.100\n Well, like in America today,\n\n40:58.100 --> 41:01.420\n cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease\n\n41:01.420 --> 41:02.540\n is one of the most common,\n\n41:02.540 --> 41:04.780\n perhaps the most common cause of death.\n\n41:04.780 --> 41:07.260\n You know, 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\n\n41:07.260 --> 41:08.420\n it was probably not.\n\n41:08.420 --> 41:09.660\n People were not living as long\n\n41:09.660 --> 41:11.380\n and people were dying of infections\n\n41:11.380 --> 41:14.180\n that we tend to die less of these days.\n\n41:14.180 --> 41:17.880\n Sure, that's true, but in terms of things to stab,\n\n41:18.940 --> 41:20.860\n so I'm trying to sort of introspect\n\n41:20.860 --> 41:24.540\n like why talk about the heart and love?\n\n41:24.540 --> 41:28.220\n My thought would be that it's because\n\n41:28.220 --> 41:31.740\n the heart was seen as the most important organism.\n\n41:31.740 --> 41:35.740\n It would be like the origin of life comes from the heart.\n\n41:35.740 --> 41:38.340\n The originator of life and the way you figure that out\n\n41:38.340 --> 41:40.620\n from sort of an ancient perspective\n\n41:40.620 --> 41:43.780\n is when you stab things,\n\n41:43.780 --> 41:46.120\n what is likely to lead to issues?\n\n41:46.120 --> 41:48.140\n It's like, it's possible to imagine\n\n41:48.140 --> 41:50.980\n that the brain is not as special as we might think\n\n41:50.980 --> 41:54.620\n from when you don't understand modern biology\n\n41:54.620 --> 41:58.660\n or physiology or neuroscience, all those kinds of things,\n\n41:58.660 --> 42:01.960\n especially because pain, you know, it's painless too,\n\n42:02.860 --> 42:05.560\n if you stab it, the brain, I mean.\n\n42:07.500 --> 42:09.880\n Yeah, anyway, so that's really interesting.\n\n42:09.880 --> 42:13.460\n I'm sure there's a kind of a poetic answer to\n\n42:13.460 --> 42:15.240\n maybe the way people wrote about it,\n\n42:15.240 --> 42:20.240\n but what to you is the wisdom in the design of the heart?\n\n42:20.240 --> 42:22.440\n I mean, the main function of the heart basically\n\n42:22.440 --> 42:25.240\n is to push blood through the cardiovascular system,\n\n42:25.240 --> 42:27.760\n through the branching blood vessels\n\n42:27.760 --> 42:30.380\n to feed every cell in the body.\n\n42:30.380 --> 42:32.760\n You know, when I believe our ancestors\n\n42:32.760 --> 42:34.640\n started off as single celled organisms\n\n42:34.640 --> 42:37.300\n floating in some ancient brew,\n\n42:37.300 --> 42:39.360\n and they were surrounded by the medium\n\n42:39.360 --> 42:41.040\n that would bring them all the nutrients they needed,\n\n42:41.040 --> 42:42.520\n so there's no issues there.\n\n42:42.520 --> 42:45.360\n And then once you start getting multicellular organisms,\n\n42:45.360 --> 42:47.760\n the kind of that are thicker and the ones on the inside\n\n42:47.760 --> 42:50.560\n aren't in contact with that sort of nutritious brew\n\n42:50.560 --> 42:52.280\n that they're growing in,\n\n42:52.280 --> 42:54.720\n you kind of need a way to distribute those nutrients\n\n42:54.720 --> 42:56.560\n to every cell, and so that's what the heart\n\n42:56.560 --> 42:58.560\n and the branching vascular tree do.\n\n42:58.560 --> 43:02.440\n So the heart, you know, it's the biggest disconnect\n\n43:02.440 --> 43:04.560\n between how the organs talked about in poetry\n\n43:04.560 --> 43:06.840\n and through history versus its actual function\n\n43:06.840 --> 43:07.800\n is probably the heart,\n\n43:07.800 --> 43:11.000\n because we ascribe all these things like love and passion\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.240\n and life itself sometimes to the heart,\n\n43:13.240 --> 43:15.720\n but actually it's just a simple mechanical pump,\n\n43:15.720 --> 43:17.160\n you know, that's all it is.\n\n43:17.160 --> 43:18.600\n I don't wanna downplay it, it's amazing,\n\n43:18.600 --> 43:20.340\n but you know, it just pushes.\n\n43:20.340 --> 43:22.480\n It fills with blood and then squeezes it,\n\n43:22.480 --> 43:23.500\n fills with blood and squeezes it,\n\n43:23.500 --> 43:25.180\n and just that squeezing, that pushing,\n\n43:25.180 --> 43:27.680\n creates the blood pressure that you need\n\n43:27.680 --> 43:29.680\n to get blood to every cell in your body,\n\n43:29.680 --> 43:31.120\n especially when you're standing upright\n\n43:31.120 --> 43:32.680\n to get blood to your brain,\n\n43:32.680 --> 43:35.440\n you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there.\n\n43:35.440 --> 43:39.240\n Isn't it amazing to you how much volume of blood\n\n43:39.240 --> 43:42.920\n just gets pushed through by this pump?\n\n43:42.920 --> 43:45.080\n Absolutely, they say every red blood cell\n\n43:45.080 --> 43:47.240\n takes about five minutes to circulate\n\n43:47.240 --> 43:48.760\n and come back to the heart,\n\n43:48.760 --> 43:52.040\n and that circulation kind of starts in the womb\n\n43:52.040 --> 43:55.520\n and continues kind of until the moment that we die,\n\n43:55.520 --> 43:56.820\n but the volume is tremendous,\n\n43:56.820 --> 44:00.120\n and it can never take a break, basically.\n\n44:00.120 --> 44:03.840\n And it's sort of propagating all kinds of stuff\n\n44:03.840 --> 44:06.080\n throughout the body, it's a delivery mechanism,\n\n44:06.080 --> 44:09.680\n blood for all kinds of good stuff and bad stuff,\n\n44:09.680 --> 44:13.760\n nutrition, drugs, all that.\n\n44:13.760 --> 44:15.200\n Right, medications too.\n\n44:15.200 --> 44:19.000\n Medications, such a fascinating design.\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.040\n And it also takes the waste away,\n\n44:21.040 --> 44:22.920\n it kind of brings the nutritious stuff,\n\n44:22.920 --> 44:24.600\n brings the nutrients, especially oxygen,\n\n44:24.600 --> 44:26.840\n but many other things, and then it also,\n\n44:26.840 --> 44:29.060\n as it passes the cell, takes the cell's waste,\n\n44:29.060 --> 44:30.960\n so it's sort of the fresh water\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:33.480\n and the sewage system in one.\n\n44:33.480 --> 44:38.480\n So about blood, what do you use fascinating about blood?\n\n44:38.840 --> 44:41.760\n So we talk about the pump that spreads the blood,\n\n44:41.760 --> 44:43.200\n but the blood itself.\n\n44:43.200 --> 44:44.920\n Right, so the blood itself is sort of,\n\n44:44.920 --> 44:48.040\n I mean, it's the most important bodily fluid, of course.\n\n44:48.040 --> 44:50.400\n From moment to moment, every cell in the body\n\n44:50.400 --> 44:54.160\n needs a flow of blood to bring it,\n\n44:54.160 --> 44:56.120\n most importantly, oxygen, but also, again,\n\n44:56.120 --> 44:57.980\n all the other nutrients and to take away waste,\n\n44:57.980 --> 45:00.220\n and if that stops for even a few moments,\n\n45:00.220 --> 45:02.360\n you can be in big trouble.\n\n45:02.360 --> 45:05.740\n So blood is sort of the most important medium.\n\n45:05.740 --> 45:09.280\n It's also, doctors use it to kind of evaluate the body.\n\n45:09.280 --> 45:12.580\n It does have this kind of all seeing quality to it,\n\n45:12.580 --> 45:16.740\n where we can evaluate organs through the blood.\n\n45:16.740 --> 45:18.920\n I can tell you about your liver, your heart, your kidney\n\n45:18.920 --> 45:21.240\n just by taking a sample of your blood.\n\n45:21.240 --> 45:23.860\n So it's sort of like this crystal ball in a way,\n\n45:23.860 --> 45:26.000\n and we use it kind of all the time\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:29.080\n to assess someone's health, to assess their disease.\n\n45:29.080 --> 45:33.080\n Is it also the attack vector for diseases,\n\n45:34.540 --> 45:37.720\n for bacteria, for viruses and all that kind of stuff?\n\n45:37.720 --> 45:40.500\n So viruses seem to attack either the throat,\n\n45:40.500 --> 45:41.520\n maybe you can correct me,\n\n45:41.520 --> 45:44.140\n but they seem to attack different parts of the body,\n\n45:44.140 --> 45:46.180\n depending on how easy it is to access\n\n45:46.180 --> 45:50.560\n and how easy it is to get in deep,\n\n45:50.560 --> 45:52.280\n depending on what you prefer.\n\n45:52.280 --> 45:54.400\n If you want to do a little bit of hard work,\n\n45:54.400 --> 45:55.880\n but you get in deep,\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:58.520\n or you don't want to do the hard work,\n\n45:58.520 --> 45:59.840\n but you don't get in deep,\n\n45:59.840 --> 46:01.320\n those are the choices viruses have.\n\n46:01.320 --> 46:04.340\n But is blood one of the sort of attack vectors?\n\n46:04.340 --> 46:07.340\n What's like, if you were trying to break into the human body,\n\n46:07.340 --> 46:12.340\n like a parasite, a virus, a bacteria, how would you do it?\n\n46:13.040 --> 46:16.240\n Like what would be the attack vectors you would explore?\n\n46:16.240 --> 46:18.140\n Right, so you got to look for the body's weaknesses,\n\n46:18.140 --> 46:21.040\n of course, you know, we have inherent weaknesses,\n\n46:21.040 --> 46:22.880\n for instance, like our respiratory tract,\n\n46:22.880 --> 46:23.880\n we have to breathe,\n\n46:23.880 --> 46:26.640\n we have to get air in from the outside.\n\n46:26.640 --> 46:28.640\n And so that's one of the entries into the body.\n\n46:28.640 --> 46:30.520\n And so, you know, when we inhale,\n\n46:30.520 --> 46:32.360\n let's say a poisonous gas, you know,\n\n46:32.360 --> 46:34.440\n it's an easy way in, you have to breathe,\n\n46:34.440 --> 46:35.880\n can't hold your breath very long,\n\n46:35.880 --> 46:39.800\n but, you know, air in our lungs is still kind of contiguous\n\n46:39.800 --> 46:41.360\n with the external atmosphere,\n\n46:41.360 --> 46:44.440\n it's not really inside the body until it does cross\n\n46:44.440 --> 46:47.400\n across the lining of the alveoli into the blood,\n\n46:47.400 --> 46:49.960\n as you said, that's when it really gets inside.\n\n46:49.960 --> 46:51.460\n And the other besides the respiratory tract,\n\n46:51.460 --> 46:53.940\n the gastrointestinal tract is another way,\n\n46:53.940 --> 46:55.160\n kind of a chink in the armor,\n\n46:55.160 --> 46:57.480\n you know, we have to eat, we have to drink,\n\n46:57.480 --> 46:59.400\n and therefore we're taking the external world\n\n46:59.400 --> 47:01.320\n into ourselves, into our gut,\n\n47:01.320 --> 47:03.120\n in order to extract from it what we need\n\n47:03.120 --> 47:05.340\n and let the rest kind of flow out.\n\n47:05.340 --> 47:08.080\n So those two, the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract,\n\n47:08.080 --> 47:09.440\n you know, there's a reason that, you know,\n\n47:09.440 --> 47:11.280\n respiratory tract infections\n\n47:11.280 --> 47:14.200\n and gastrointestinal infections are kind of the most common\n\n47:14.200 --> 47:17.780\n that afflict us because those are the ways in to the body.\n\n47:17.780 --> 47:20.120\n So I would definitely pick one of those,\n\n47:20.120 --> 47:22.080\n not just be a lazy cold in the nose,\n\n47:22.080 --> 47:24.440\n but really a more aggressive pneumonia down deep\n\n47:24.440 --> 47:27.040\n in the lungs and get across that barrier into the blood.\n\n47:27.040 --> 47:32.040\n But also the whole sex thing that humans do.\n\n47:32.040 --> 47:36.200\n So speaking of which, let us go for time\n\n47:36.200 --> 47:38.440\n to the genitals chapter.\n\n47:38.440 --> 47:41.280\n So what are genitals?\n\n47:41.280 --> 47:43.360\n I think I've heard of those.\n\n47:43.360 --> 47:45.960\n I think I've read about a penis and a vagina.\n\n47:45.960 --> 47:48.920\n Can you explain to me how those work?\n\n47:48.920 --> 47:50.200\n Just asking for a friend,\n\n47:50.200 --> 47:54.200\n but also what do you use fascinating about it\n\n47:54.200 --> 47:58.820\n and maybe what's misunderstood or little known about them?\n\n47:58.820 --> 48:03.420\n Sure, so they're very unique organs, I would say.\n\n48:03.420 --> 48:06.060\n One of the things that I like to point out is that,\n\n48:06.060 --> 48:08.660\n you know, while every organ from moment to moment\n\n48:08.660 --> 48:10.820\n keeps us alive and ensures our survival,\n\n48:10.820 --> 48:12.740\n the genitals are in a way the opposite.\n\n48:12.740 --> 48:15.660\n You know, we don't need them from moment to moment.\n\n48:15.660 --> 48:17.420\n You don't even have to use them at all.\n\n48:17.420 --> 48:20.020\n And in fact, they often make us do stupid things\n\n48:20.020 --> 48:23.100\n that are the opposite of kind of enhancing survival.\n\n48:23.100 --> 48:26.420\n So, and they, you know, they've affected the brain\n\n48:26.420 --> 48:29.140\n and you can become sort of focused and nuts\n\n48:29.140 --> 48:31.940\n based on those desires that kind of stem from the genitals.\n\n48:31.940 --> 48:34.040\n So they can be dangerous organs too.\n\n48:34.920 --> 48:36.860\n But you know, I mean, sexual dimorphism\n\n48:36.860 --> 48:39.540\n helps with genetic variability,\n\n48:39.540 --> 48:41.560\n as it does in so many other organisms.\n\n48:41.560 --> 48:42.780\n You know, you take two people\n\n48:42.780 --> 48:44.320\n and mix them together, their genetics,\n\n48:44.320 --> 48:46.100\n you just get a lot more variation\n\n48:46.100 --> 48:50.460\n and more opportunities to try different genetic codes\n\n48:50.460 --> 48:52.180\n and see what'll enhance survival\n\n48:52.180 --> 48:54.380\n as we talked about sex and death.\n\n48:54.380 --> 48:55.980\n I talk about in the book, a lot of,\n\n48:55.980 --> 48:57.740\n for instance, the female genital tract,\n\n48:57.740 --> 49:00.100\n how the uterus is very unusual\n\n49:00.100 --> 49:02.780\n because, you know, it doesn't even sort of wake up\n\n49:02.780 --> 49:05.540\n and start doing its thing until the second decade of life.\n\n49:05.540 --> 49:08.540\n You know, it's even though babies,\n\n49:09.500 --> 49:12.140\n female babies are born with all of the eggs\n\n49:12.140 --> 49:14.260\n they'll ever have in their ovaries already.\n\n49:14.260 --> 49:15.940\n They're just sort of in this stasis\n\n49:15.940 --> 49:18.980\n until they start waking up kind of once a month.\n\n49:18.980 --> 49:20.480\n And it's this cycle, you know,\n\n49:20.480 --> 49:23.060\n there's so much in our bodies that are cyclical and rhythmic,\n\n49:23.060 --> 49:26.240\n the heartbeat, the breathing, but menstruation\n\n49:26.240 --> 49:28.660\n is kind of a very strange rhythm\n\n49:28.660 --> 49:31.360\n that takes over a decade to start.\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:34.140\n And only, you know, the rhythm beats once a month,\n\n49:34.140 --> 49:35.740\n which is very slow compared\n\n49:35.740 --> 49:37.520\n to every other rhythm of the body.\n\n49:37.520 --> 49:40.380\n The other unusual thing is, you know, in medicine,\n\n49:40.380 --> 49:43.320\n when rhythms of the body cease, when they stop,\n\n49:43.320 --> 49:44.780\n those are emergencies, right?\n\n49:44.780 --> 49:47.060\n When your heart stops, that's a cardiac arrest.\n\n49:47.060 --> 49:50.200\n You need CPR, maybe an electric shock to restart it.\n\n49:50.200 --> 49:51.980\n When your breathing stops, you know,\n\n49:51.980 --> 49:53.740\n you need a breathing machine to breathe for you\n\n49:53.740 --> 49:56.100\n or something to reverse whatever might be causing\n\n49:56.100 --> 49:58.100\n the suppression of your breathing.\n\n49:58.100 --> 49:59.980\n But when menstruation stops,\n\n49:59.980 --> 50:03.500\n it's the point of menstruation in the first place.\n\n50:03.500 --> 50:06.180\n The whole reason that the uterus grows a lining\n\n50:06.180 --> 50:09.380\n and sheds it each month is to one day, you know,\n\n50:09.380 --> 50:11.700\n get fertile, the ovum to get fertilized\n\n50:11.700 --> 50:13.460\n and for it to implant in the lining,\n\n50:13.460 --> 50:14.540\n and then the rhythm ceases.\n\n50:14.540 --> 50:16.620\n And that's obviously not a medical emergency,\n\n50:16.620 --> 50:19.140\n unlike most other rhythms, you know, cessations,\n\n50:19.140 --> 50:21.520\n it's the point of the whole thing in the first place.\n\n50:21.520 --> 50:25.900\n So these particular penis and vagina are that whole thing,\n\n50:25.900 --> 50:26.940\n the uterus, whatever.\n\n50:26.940 --> 50:28.980\n Am I not using the wrong terms?\n\n50:28.980 --> 50:29.820\n I don't know.\n\n50:29.820 --> 50:31.100\n I'll just keep saying.\n\n50:31.100 --> 50:32.220\n You use those terms.\n\n50:32.220 --> 50:35.320\n There's more technical, there's parts, various, various parts.\n\n50:35.320 --> 50:38.020\n In medical school, you learn every bump\n\n50:38.020 --> 50:41.260\n and, you know, every little part of every little organ\n\n50:41.260 --> 50:42.740\n including the genitals, so.\n\n50:43.860 --> 50:47.900\n I never really thought of it this way, as you said,\n\n50:47.900 --> 50:51.500\n is that most organs are kind of full time employees.\n\n50:51.500 --> 50:54.300\n Like 24 seven, they're doing something.\n\n50:54.300 --> 50:56.060\n And then there's some organs,\n\n50:57.540 --> 51:00.940\n penis, vagina being representative of this,\n\n51:00.940 --> 51:03.300\n they're not functioning all the time.\n\n51:03.300 --> 51:05.420\n They're only functioning every once in a while\n\n51:05.420 --> 51:08.540\n and then get us to do stupid stuff or awesome stuff\n\n51:08.540 --> 51:09.580\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n51:09.580 --> 51:11.740\n But they're not essential for human survival\n\n51:11.740 --> 51:14.260\n on a second by second basis.\n\n51:14.260 --> 51:18.340\n And that the whole cyclical nature of the human body,\n\n51:18.340 --> 51:20.940\n how many other cycles are on a monthly basis?\n\n51:20.940 --> 51:23.420\n Like that far apart.\n\n51:23.420 --> 51:25.860\n That's a fascinating design\n\n51:25.860 --> 51:27.140\n that the human body would do that\n\n51:27.140 --> 51:32.140\n and wouldn't start until the second decade of life.\n\n51:32.500 --> 51:35.780\n It's almost like, what do I want to say?\n\n51:35.780 --> 51:39.980\n There's some kind of meta planning going on.\n\n51:39.980 --> 51:41.940\n Like this is the optimal solution\n\n51:41.940 --> 51:44.460\n for the sexual selection mechanism\n\n51:44.460 --> 51:48.420\n among like somewhat intelligent species.\n\n51:48.420 --> 51:53.380\n Like it's useful to after the brain has developed\n\n51:53.380 --> 51:57.100\n sufficiently long to now be making\n\n51:57.100 --> 51:58.940\n sexual selection decisions.\n\n51:58.940 --> 52:01.540\n Like you need time for this computer,\n\n52:01.540 --> 52:04.320\n this really powerful computer to load in the info.\n\n52:05.780 --> 52:06.620\n Interesting.\n\n52:06.620 --> 52:08.420\n You also need the body to develop.\n\n52:08.420 --> 52:10.780\n A child simply isn't big enough\n\n52:10.780 --> 52:14.400\n to be pregnant and deliver another baby.\n\n52:14.400 --> 52:16.540\n I wonder if there's animals in which this happens\n\n52:16.540 --> 52:19.260\n at a much more accelerated pace in different stages.\n\n52:19.260 --> 52:21.700\n Definitely, especially certain kinds of insects,\n\n52:21.700 --> 52:25.380\n like Drosophila, a lot of the fruit fly,\n\n52:25.380 --> 52:26.660\n a lot of experiments are done on\n\n52:26.660 --> 52:28.780\n because their life cycle is so rapid.\n\n52:28.780 --> 52:31.420\n A lot of kind of insects and other creatures\n\n52:31.420 --> 52:34.580\n are almost ready to mate as soon as they're born.\n\n52:34.580 --> 52:35.640\n Not us.\n\n52:35.640 --> 52:36.660\n Not us.\n\n52:36.660 --> 52:41.660\n Is there any improvements to the design?\n\n52:42.820 --> 52:45.420\n So a lot of people are very interested\n\n52:45.420 --> 52:47.820\n in these particular body parts.\n\n52:47.820 --> 52:49.660\n If you were to sort of step back\n\n52:49.660 --> 52:52.980\n as a geneticist, biological designer,\n\n52:52.980 --> 52:55.500\n or maybe a computer scientist, computer engineer\n\n52:55.500 --> 53:00.500\n trying to build human 2.0 or maybe a robot,\n\n53:00.660 --> 53:04.240\n how would you improve the penis and the vagina?\n\n53:05.380 --> 53:06.780\n Well, the penis for starters,\n\n53:06.780 --> 53:09.460\n I mean, let's also discuss the testicles.\n\n53:09.460 --> 53:10.820\n They're very important too.\n\n53:10.820 --> 53:11.660\n I mean.\n\n53:11.660 --> 53:14.740\n Okay, so they're fragile and they're important\n\n53:14.740 --> 53:18.060\n and yet they're hanging off the body in danger basically.\n\n53:18.060 --> 53:20.260\n So does that make sense?\n\n53:20.260 --> 53:22.000\n You know, they begin in the womb,\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:25.260\n they begin inside the abdomen and they slowly descend\n\n53:25.260 --> 53:26.620\n and sometimes before birth,\n\n53:26.620 --> 53:29.100\n sometimes in the first year of life, sometimes never,\n\n53:29.100 --> 53:32.700\n they pop out of the body and end up hanging in the scrotum.\n\n53:32.700 --> 53:35.060\n There's a reason because the chemical reactions\n\n53:35.060 --> 53:37.700\n that create sperm function best\n\n53:37.700 --> 53:40.860\n at a few degrees cooler than body temperature.\n\n53:40.860 --> 53:44.620\n And so that's why you might notice in the warm weather,\n\n53:44.620 --> 53:47.540\n they might hang further down and in the cold weather,\n\n53:47.540 --> 53:50.340\n they scrunch themselves up to get closer to the body\n\n53:50.340 --> 53:53.500\n to maintain that ideal temperature a few degrees cooler.\n\n53:55.160 --> 53:56.240\n So it's hard, you know,\n\n53:56.240 --> 53:58.280\n if you could create a sperm production mechanism\n\n53:58.280 --> 54:00.100\n that did not rely on that lower temperature,\n\n54:00.100 --> 54:00.940\n that would be great.\n\n54:00.940 --> 54:03.800\n Keep them inside the body protected like the ovaries are.\n\n54:04.940 --> 54:07.140\n Oh, then you wouldn't rely on the lower temperature.\n\n54:07.140 --> 54:10.780\n I thought you meant create some kind of weird internal\n\n54:10.780 --> 54:11.940\n cooling mechanism.\n\n54:11.940 --> 54:14.500\n No, well, I guess that would be one solution,\n\n54:14.500 --> 54:17.580\n but just maybe a different type of chemical reaction\n\n54:17.580 --> 54:19.660\n or, you know, would not be reliant\n\n54:19.660 --> 54:21.860\n on the lower temperature, let's say.\n\n54:21.860 --> 54:25.140\n You know, it'd be great to design a spermatogenesis\n\n54:25.140 --> 54:28.460\n or a sperm production process that would function best\n\n54:28.460 --> 54:30.460\n at body temperature and then we can keep\n\n54:30.460 --> 54:32.540\n those delicate organs inside the body\n\n54:32.540 --> 54:35.180\n and not have them hanging out in danger.\n\n54:35.180 --> 54:37.780\n Or maybe the argument for this design\n\n54:37.780 --> 54:42.380\n is maybe it's nice to put them in danger\n\n54:42.380 --> 54:45.180\n so you are constantly concerned about it.\n\n54:46.100 --> 54:49.100\n Could be, maybe that's beneficial for male psychology,\n\n54:49.100 --> 54:50.140\n I'm not really sure.\n\n54:50.140 --> 54:51.620\n There's a psychological element here\n\n54:51.620 --> 54:53.340\n about the evolution that could be.\n\n54:53.340 --> 54:54.880\n So that's the testicles.\n\n54:56.540 --> 54:57.380\n Penis?\n\n54:58.780 --> 55:00.460\n A better way to do it, you know?\n\n55:00.460 --> 55:03.060\n I mean, it's pretty good as it is.\n\n55:03.060 --> 55:05.740\n You know, it kind of, when it's time for it to work,\n\n55:05.740 --> 55:08.980\n it grows and stiffens and when it's time for it not to work,\n\n55:08.980 --> 55:12.940\n it kind of shrinks and hangs out.\n\n55:12.940 --> 55:17.300\n Saw this on a Seinfeld episode, so I know how it works.\n\n55:17.300 --> 55:18.220\n Shrinkage.\n\n55:18.220 --> 55:19.460\n Yeah, that was a good one.\n\n55:19.460 --> 55:22.980\n But you know, that's also a bit unique,\n\n55:22.980 --> 55:26.580\n I suppose, that the way it has this erectile tissue.\n\n55:26.580 --> 55:29.260\n Actually, they're similar in the mouth\n\n55:29.260 --> 55:32.880\n of certain baleen whales, there's a certain similar\n\n55:32.880 --> 55:37.620\n kind of erectile tissue that helps cool them off\n\n55:37.620 --> 55:39.780\n because they have so much blubber\n\n55:39.780 --> 55:42.660\n and create so much heat in moving around and feeding\n\n55:42.660 --> 55:44.020\n that they have actually a similar,\n\n55:44.020 --> 55:45.700\n similar to the penis organ in their mouth\n\n55:45.700 --> 55:48.140\n that helps cool their bodies, because it's a big problem.\n\n55:48.140 --> 55:51.020\n They have to store all that blubber for fuel,\n\n55:51.020 --> 55:53.140\n but it makes them too hot, so as a compensation,\n\n55:53.140 --> 55:55.320\n they have this kind of erectile organ in their mouth.\n\n55:55.320 --> 55:56.160\n Okay.\n\n55:57.540 --> 55:59.160\n What about vagina?\n\n55:59.160 --> 56:02.900\n You know, the fact that miscarriages sometimes happen\n\n56:02.900 --> 56:05.800\n because of sexually transmitted diseases,\n\n56:05.800 --> 56:08.060\n because of trauma, you know, it'd be great\n\n56:08.060 --> 56:11.340\n if the uterus where the growing fetus is\n\n56:11.340 --> 56:14.020\n is sort of even more protected from those things.\n\n56:15.760 --> 56:18.680\n You know, I guess that's a side effect of the fact\n\n56:18.680 --> 56:20.820\n that people still have sex when they're pregnant\n\n56:20.820 --> 56:23.200\n or still, you know, exposed to injury.\n\n56:23.200 --> 56:25.420\n If there was a way to make it more protected,\n\n56:25.420 --> 56:27.500\n perhaps that would be even better.\n\n56:27.500 --> 56:30.500\n I did see an article recently about artificial wombs,\n\n56:30.500 --> 56:33.740\n which are rapidly becoming a reality,\n\n56:33.740 --> 56:36.540\n and in animal studies, they're able to prolong\n\n56:36.540 --> 56:40.780\n the gestation of a fetus by a month in an artificial womb.\n\n56:40.780 --> 56:42.740\n Can you explain the artificial aspect\n\n56:42.740 --> 56:43.700\n of the artificial womb?\n\n56:43.700 --> 56:46.860\n Sure, it's, I believe it acts almost\n\n56:46.860 --> 56:49.120\n like a heart lung bypass machine,\n\n56:49.120 --> 56:51.980\n so when someone's getting like bypass surgery,\n\n56:51.980 --> 56:54.460\n their heart is stopped, literally they throw ice\n\n56:54.460 --> 56:58.240\n in the chest and they give a potassium infusion\n\n56:58.240 --> 57:01.040\n through the blood, which stops the heart,\n\n57:01.040 --> 57:04.220\n but the blood is run through a machine\n\n57:04.220 --> 57:07.100\n that basically does the work of the heart\n\n57:07.100 --> 57:09.380\n and lungs together, gets oxygen into the blood\n\n57:09.380 --> 57:11.820\n and then pushes it back into the body.\n\n57:11.820 --> 57:14.100\n So I believe it's a sort of similar mechanism\n\n57:14.100 --> 57:16.920\n to keep blood and nutrition flowing to this fetus,\n\n57:18.140 --> 57:20.900\n and so it's just not inside the body of a parent,\n\n57:20.900 --> 57:23.340\n it's in some kind of other device,\n\n57:23.340 --> 57:27.180\n but I think that science is gonna rapidly improve.\n\n57:27.180 --> 57:29.960\n One benefit is, you know, babies are born premature,\n\n57:29.960 --> 57:33.140\n and while, you know, neonatology is able\n\n57:33.140 --> 57:36.140\n to continuously kind of lower the age of viability\n\n57:36.140 --> 57:38.060\n through better technology and understanding\n\n57:38.060 --> 57:40.700\n how, what you can, medicines and other things\n\n57:40.700 --> 57:42.940\n you can do to premature babies when they're born,\n\n57:42.940 --> 57:46.220\n you know, ideally, if let's say premature labor begins,\n\n57:46.220 --> 57:49.260\n you can't stop it, that baby's coming out one way\n\n57:49.260 --> 57:50.860\n or the other, if you could just then stick it\n\n57:50.860 --> 57:52.740\n into an artificial womb where it can continue\n\n57:52.740 --> 57:55.580\n its development, that would save a whole host\n\n57:55.580 --> 57:57.820\n of problems, often those babies born very early\n\n57:57.820 --> 58:00.540\n suffer from damage to various organs,\n\n58:00.540 --> 58:02.580\n including the brain, you know, for the rest of their life,\n\n58:02.580 --> 58:04.980\n so that could be a very important technology.\n\n58:04.980 --> 58:07.760\n So some aspects of the human body,\n\n58:07.760 --> 58:10.380\n we can develop technologies that outsource them,\n\n58:10.380 --> 58:15.380\n sort of offload some of the stress\n\n58:16.140 --> 58:19.780\n and the workload from the human body to do it elsewhere.\n\n58:19.780 --> 58:21.820\n Like dialysis does that for kidneys, you know,\n\n58:21.820 --> 58:25.220\n people can live decades without kidneys\n\n58:25.220 --> 58:29.020\n as long as they get dialysis, which does the work for them.\n\n58:29.020 --> 58:31.180\n Not every organ can do that, for instance,\n\n58:31.180 --> 58:34.180\n the liver, there's no dialysis version for the liver,\n\n58:34.180 --> 58:36.940\n like if your liver fails, you need a liver transplant\n\n58:36.940 --> 58:39.580\n and that's the only thing that's gonna do it for you.\n\n58:40.620 --> 58:45.620\n So that's the world's first artificial womb for humans\n\n58:45.620 --> 58:48.580\n and we're looking at a picture of what looks like\n\n58:48.580 --> 58:50.300\n gigantic balloons.\n\n58:50.300 --> 58:51.900\n Matrix, here we come.\n\n58:51.900 --> 58:53.740\n This is very matrixy.\n\n58:53.740 --> 58:55.420\n How are they floating?\n\n58:55.420 --> 58:57.220\n What are we even looking at?\n\n58:57.220 --> 59:00.340\n There's giant red spheres.\n\n59:00.340 --> 59:02.420\n This really looks like the matrix.\n\n59:03.860 --> 59:04.740\n I wonder where it's from,\n\n59:04.740 --> 59:06.780\n so there seems to be a paper on this too.\n\n59:07.660 --> 59:10.620\n I don't know too much about it, but I did see that there,\n\n59:10.620 --> 59:12.740\n it's advancing very rapidly.\n\n59:12.740 --> 59:14.940\n The world's first artificial womb for humans.\n\n59:14.940 --> 59:18.700\n Scientists in the Netherlands say they're within 10 years\n\n59:18.700 --> 59:20.340\n of developing an artificial womb\n\n59:20.340 --> 59:22.920\n that could save the lives of premature babies.\n\n59:22.920 --> 59:25.420\n Premature birth before 37 weeks is globally\n\n59:25.420 --> 59:27.640\n the biggest cause of death among newborns,\n\n59:27.640 --> 59:31.340\n but the development also raises ethical questions\n\n59:31.340 --> 59:36.260\n about the future of baby making and so on and so forth.\n\n59:36.260 --> 59:40.420\n Wow, we're going to be facing a lot of ethical questions\n\n59:41.380 --> 59:45.780\n as we start to mess with human biology.\n\n59:45.780 --> 59:50.460\n In an effort to help human biology,\n\n59:50.460 --> 59:52.540\n we might start to mess with it.\n\n59:52.540 --> 59:54.540\n That's going to be very interesting.\n\n59:54.540 --> 59:59.280\n Let's take steps towards the matrix.\n\n1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:06.180\n All right, what about the neighbors, poop, feces?\n\n1:00:07.540 --> 1:00:11.660\n There seems to be a lot of interesting stories\n\n1:00:11.660 --> 1:00:14.360\n in that particular output as well.\n\n1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:20.260\n What to you is fascinating?\n\n1:00:20.260 --> 1:00:25.260\n What to you maybe is misunderstood\n\n1:00:26.860 --> 1:00:29.100\n or little known about poop?\n\n1:00:30.580 --> 1:00:33.820\n Well, it's hilarious, for one thing, that we do it.\n\n1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:36.660\n The word is great as well.\n\n1:00:36.660 --> 1:00:38.060\n There's so many different words.\n\n1:00:38.060 --> 1:00:40.600\n I do, when I'm talking to the parents\n\n1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:42.740\n of pediatric patients, I use the word poop.\n\n1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:44.620\n I don't often, when I'm talking to adult patients,\n\n1:00:44.620 --> 1:00:47.140\n try to choose a more mature word.\n\n1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:49.920\n But poop is amazing.\n\n1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:54.920\n I mean, I guess it's sort of the dirtiest, the most vile,\n\n1:00:55.220 --> 1:00:57.900\n the most hated aspect of our bodies.\n\n1:00:57.900 --> 1:01:00.580\n It's the grossest, we don't want to think about it,\n\n1:01:00.580 --> 1:01:04.460\n talk about it, have it anywhere near our food\n\n1:01:04.460 --> 1:01:08.580\n or in social interactions with good reason.\n\n1:01:08.580 --> 1:01:10.180\n I mentioned gastrointestinal infections\n\n1:01:10.180 --> 1:01:11.700\n are one of the most common infections\n\n1:01:11.700 --> 1:01:13.220\n the human body suffers from.\n\n1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:17.520\n And the way they spread from person to person,\n\n1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:20.660\n grossly enough, is referred to as the fecal oral route,\n\n1:01:20.660 --> 1:01:22.840\n which means a bit of someone's stool\n\n1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:25.920\n is getting into your, you're swallowing it,\n\n1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:27.900\n through water supply.\n\n1:01:27.900 --> 1:01:29.940\n For instance, diarrhea is actually quite\n\n1:01:29.940 --> 1:01:32.820\n a brilliant mechanism of these microbes, right?\n\n1:01:32.820 --> 1:01:35.720\n If you, let's say you're in the intestine of one person,\n\n1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:38.900\n your goal is to get into the intestines of another person.\n\n1:01:38.900 --> 1:01:41.620\n Brilliant to just trick their intestines\n\n1:01:41.620 --> 1:01:45.020\n into secreting all this fluid into the intestines\n\n1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:47.780\n to increase the volume of stool and its runniness\n\n1:01:47.780 --> 1:01:50.100\n so that when they do poop, it gets into the water supply\n\n1:01:50.100 --> 1:01:51.380\n and then everyone else kind of ends up\n\n1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:52.780\n getting infected as well.\n\n1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:54.380\n Wow, that's brilliant.\n\n1:01:54.380 --> 1:01:57.920\n Just the same way like tuberculosis or coronavirus\n\n1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:00.140\n kind of infects your lungs and makes you cough\n\n1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:01.380\n and you send it out into the air\n\n1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:02.740\n and it ends up in other people's lungs.\n\n1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:04.580\n And that's all evolution.\n\n1:02:04.580 --> 1:02:06.000\n Yeah, it's brilliant.\n\n1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.020\n So diarrhea is intelligent, is a big takeaway lesson.\n\n1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:14.020\n It's one of the most intelligent things we can do\n\n1:02:14.020 --> 1:02:15.980\n as an entirety of an organism,\n\n1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:17.900\n not just the particular cognitive organism,\n\n1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:22.280\n but there's, we're made up of bacteria and viruses\n\n1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:24.320\n and there's a lot of visitors and so on.\n\n1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:25.760\n As the entirety of the system,\n\n1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:28.360\n diarrhea is one of our better accomplishments.\n\n1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:29.280\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:33.480\n Well, I wonder, why is poop funny?\n\n1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:37.020\n I think a lot of that is socially constructed,\n\n1:02:37.020 --> 1:02:39.420\n just how it's sort of supposed to be hidden away\n\n1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:41.140\n yet something we always do,\n\n1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:43.380\n something we chuckle about as children.\n\n1:02:43.380 --> 1:02:45.020\n But even in healthcare,\n\n1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:48.100\n it becomes this big topic of conversation\n\n1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:50.340\n because you end up talking about it constantly.\n\n1:02:50.340 --> 1:02:52.360\n Like in the ER, people come in,\n\n1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:55.100\n they're complete strangers.\n\n1:02:55.100 --> 1:02:58.700\n Sometimes like a nice old lady who resembles my grandmother\n\n1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:00.600\n and all of a sudden I have to ask her all about\n\n1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:01.980\n what's happening in the bathroom.\n\n1:03:01.980 --> 1:03:03.300\n Like, is she straining?\n\n1:03:03.300 --> 1:03:04.480\n What color is it?\n\n1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:07.840\n What's the consistency?\n\n1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:10.300\n Does it float on top of the water more than it should?\n\n1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:11.200\n Is it hard to flush?\n\n1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:13.340\n I mean, there's a million different questions you learn\n\n1:03:13.340 --> 1:03:17.420\n as a medical student and you're like this poop detective\n\n1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:19.380\n when people come in with issues.\n\n1:03:19.380 --> 1:03:22.300\n And so it's funny, I guess,\n\n1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:25.060\n in the exam room with the doctor patient relationship,\n\n1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:26.620\n there's sort of no barriers.\n\n1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:27.700\n You talk about everything\n\n1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:29.900\n and you're talking about the most intimate details\n\n1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:31.380\n of a person's life,\n\n1:03:31.380 --> 1:03:33.260\n even though you just met them a second ago.\n\n1:03:33.260 --> 1:03:36.820\n It's so different than normal social interactions.\n\n1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:38.940\n Yet there is this social aspect.\n\n1:03:38.940 --> 1:03:40.740\n A lot of what I do is social.\n\n1:03:40.740 --> 1:03:43.900\n It seems like doctors, what they do is mostly scientific,\n\n1:03:43.900 --> 1:03:46.540\n but actually it's just relating to another person\n\n1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:49.860\n and you have to maintain your professional demeanor\n\n1:03:49.860 --> 1:03:51.860\n and this normal human level interaction,\n\n1:03:51.860 --> 1:03:53.820\n even though you're talking about poop.\n\n1:03:54.820 --> 1:03:57.460\n And that's a skill, that's an art and a science.\n\n1:03:57.460 --> 1:03:59.620\n Well, okay, actually I wanna linger on that\n\n1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:03.260\n because I'm a fan of just diving into conversations\n\n1:04:03.260 --> 1:04:08.260\n right away with strangers, just getting no small talk.\n\n1:04:08.260 --> 1:04:12.500\n And this is the ultimate, I don't know if it's the ultimate,\n\n1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:14.460\n but it's one version of no small talk.\n\n1:04:14.460 --> 1:04:16.180\n You get right to the point.\n\n1:04:18.100 --> 1:04:21.260\n That's really powerful from a psychology perspective.\n\n1:04:21.260 --> 1:04:22.460\n You're a kind of therapist\n\n1:04:22.460 --> 1:04:26.260\n or you have the power to be a therapist.\n\n1:04:26.260 --> 1:04:28.700\n I don't mean just about the medical condition of the body,\n\n1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:30.460\n but the psychological.\n\n1:04:30.460 --> 1:04:35.460\n There's so much fear connected to this concern.\n\n1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:40.460\n Also, self doubt, insecurities,\n\n1:04:42.820 --> 1:04:46.300\n even sort of existential thoughts about your mortality,\n\n1:04:46.300 --> 1:04:48.860\n all of those things are right there in the room.\n\n1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:52.500\n So I think one way doctors deal with that\n\n1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:54.940\n is they kind of have this cold way about them.\n\n1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:56.740\n They almost have like dual mode.\n\n1:04:56.740 --> 1:05:00.900\n One is like, I'm going to be friendly on the surface\n\n1:05:00.900 --> 1:05:05.900\n and cold about the brutal honesty of the biology.\n\n1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:10.700\n But I wonder if there's like a skillful middle ground,\n\n1:05:11.900 --> 1:05:15.580\n this dangerous place where you can help people\n\n1:05:15.580 --> 1:05:18.460\n deal with their psychological insecurities,\n\n1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:21.020\n concerns, fears, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:23.140\n Is that just really tough to do?\n\n1:05:23.140 --> 1:05:25.860\n Yeah, it's a huge part of being a doctor\n\n1:05:25.860 --> 1:05:28.300\n is dealing with the psychological aspects\n\n1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:30.300\n of whatever's going on with the patient's body.\n\n1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:32.980\n I mean, in the ER, you deal with psychiatric emergencies\n\n1:05:32.980 --> 1:05:35.540\n kind of left and right more than ever these days.\n\n1:05:35.540 --> 1:05:37.420\n And that's a huge issue,\n\n1:05:37.420 --> 1:05:41.540\n not to mention sort of drug use, alcohol related stuff,\n\n1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:43.140\n that gets into sort of psychology\n\n1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:45.340\n and the human love of intoxicants\n\n1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:49.740\n and changing the brain's chemistry and habit, of course,\n\n1:05:49.740 --> 1:05:51.940\n we're creatures of habit and that plays in as well.\n\n1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:54.060\n I mean, a big part of, for instance, pediatrics\n\n1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:59.060\n is reassuring parents and kind of convincing them,\n\n1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:01.060\n giving them the confidence that what's going on\n\n1:06:01.060 --> 1:06:03.740\n with their child is not serious, will go away on its own,\n\n1:06:03.740 --> 1:06:06.300\n does not need any particular intervention.\n\n1:06:06.300 --> 1:06:11.300\n And, but adults too, reassurance is a huge part of the game.\n\n1:06:12.980 --> 1:06:17.420\n Yeah, in the ER, you see humanity at its most raw.\n\n1:06:17.420 --> 1:06:20.780\n I feel like you get this tremendous insight into people,\n\n1:06:20.780 --> 1:06:22.260\n how they live, what they worry about,\n\n1:06:22.260 --> 1:06:24.060\n what they think about, how their body works\n\n1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:25.300\n and also how their mind works\n\n1:06:25.300 --> 1:06:28.140\n that you almost don't see anywhere else.\n\n1:06:28.140 --> 1:06:30.940\n It's a really interesting place to work.\n\n1:06:30.940 --> 1:06:32.980\n And also the way our society is shaped,\n\n1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:35.500\n the ER is where people go for almost everything.\n\n1:06:35.500 --> 1:06:37.780\n When they're suicidal, they come to the ER.\n\n1:06:37.780 --> 1:06:40.660\n When they're too high on drugs to walk, they come to the ER.\n\n1:06:40.660 --> 1:06:42.780\n Children who have been abused, sexually abused,\n\n1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:45.900\n physically abused, come to the ER for us to investigate.\n\n1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:48.380\n It's sort of like the all purpose waste bin\n\n1:06:48.380 --> 1:06:51.260\n for the dregs of society, what people do to themselves\n\n1:06:51.260 --> 1:06:53.300\n and what they do to other people.\n\n1:06:53.300 --> 1:06:55.420\n You mentioned you're interested in the darkness of humanity\n\n1:06:55.420 --> 1:06:58.900\n and made me think of the ER where you really see\n\n1:06:58.900 --> 1:07:02.020\n what human life is like in the ER.\n\n1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:04.420\n Okay, you tweet about, you write about,\n\n1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:06.820\n you think about the emergency room ER.\n\n1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:09.100\n That's really fascinating.\n\n1:07:10.100 --> 1:07:13.100\n Just the little window you give to that world\n\n1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:14.140\n is fascinating.\n\n1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:20.540\n What lessons about humanity do you draw\n\n1:07:20.540 --> 1:07:24.380\n from this place where you're so near to death?\n\n1:07:24.380 --> 1:07:26.860\n There's so much chaos.\n\n1:07:26.860 --> 1:07:29.180\n There's so much variety of what's wrong.\n\n1:07:29.180 --> 1:07:34.180\n So little information or the urgent nature\n\n1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:39.380\n of the information inflows such that you can't really reason\n\n1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:41.900\n sort of thoroughly and deeply and collect all the data,\n\n1:07:41.900 --> 1:07:42.900\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:07:42.900 --> 1:07:45.900\n You have to act fast and then everybody's freaking out.\n\n1:07:45.900 --> 1:07:48.020\n Can you just speak to the human condition\n\n1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:53.020\n that you get a glimpse at through the ER experience?\n\n1:07:55.020 --> 1:07:57.420\n Yeah, I think you do see all those things.\n\n1:07:57.420 --> 1:08:00.340\n I think on one end of the spectrum,\n\n1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:02.100\n it is this very unique place\n\n1:08:02.100 --> 1:08:03.820\n where you get all these unique insights.\n\n1:08:03.820 --> 1:08:07.220\n On the other end, it can become a ho hum workplace\n\n1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:09.660\n just like any other, which is sort of surprising.\n\n1:08:09.660 --> 1:08:11.900\n As I mentioned before, humans seem to be able to get used\n\n1:08:11.900 --> 1:08:15.540\n to almost anything and doctors can get ho hum used to,\n\n1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:18.220\n oh, dying of a heart attack, oh, actively in labor\n\n1:08:18.220 --> 1:08:19.380\n and the baby's half out.\n\n1:08:19.380 --> 1:08:23.620\n Oh, just ho hum, I know what to do, going about my job\n\n1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:26.020\n and go home and have dinner with my family\n\n1:08:26.020 --> 1:08:27.300\n and not think too much about it.\n\n1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:28.580\n That's amazing.\n\n1:08:28.580 --> 1:08:33.220\n I do try to maintain both my fascination.\n\n1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:35.820\n I think writers in general tend to think more\n\n1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:37.620\n about what they see, write more about what they see,\n\n1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:40.620\n maybe draw connections with what they see to other things.\n\n1:08:40.620 --> 1:08:42.380\n So I do think that writer's perspective\n\n1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:45.940\n does help me kind of maintain my fascination\n\n1:08:45.940 --> 1:08:48.780\n and my kind of more of an insightful perspective\n\n1:08:48.780 --> 1:08:51.820\n than just a ho hum, water cooler conversation.\n\n1:08:53.180 --> 1:08:54.460\n But you do see a lot.\n\n1:08:55.940 --> 1:08:58.020\n In a way, medical problems are sort of\n\n1:08:58.020 --> 1:09:00.180\n the great equalizer, right?\n\n1:09:00.180 --> 1:09:03.180\n Class, race, culture, background,\n\n1:09:03.180 --> 1:09:05.940\n the failings of the human body, the way it fails\n\n1:09:05.940 --> 1:09:08.500\n and what we can do to help in those situations\n\n1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:10.340\n is almost universal.\n\n1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:13.140\n I always like this quote from, Chekhov was a doctor\n\n1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:18.140\n and a writer and he treated a lot of peasants\n\n1:09:18.260 --> 1:09:20.860\n very low class and also treated a lot of aristocrats.\n\n1:09:20.860 --> 1:09:24.260\n And he wrote that they all have the same ugly bodies\n\n1:09:24.260 --> 1:09:27.380\n basically, which I think is really right on.\n\n1:09:27.380 --> 1:09:29.940\n And it's sort of, you can see people\n\n1:09:29.940 --> 1:09:32.340\n underneath a superficial layer of clothing,\n\n1:09:32.340 --> 1:09:34.100\n maybe it's the most expensive clothing\n\n1:09:34.100 --> 1:09:35.700\n bought from the fanciest places,\n\n1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:38.460\n but underneath their body is still failing in the same way\n\n1:09:38.460 --> 1:09:40.660\n and they still have the same anxieties, the same worry\n\n1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:43.460\n about mortality, the same concerns about why their poop\n\n1:09:43.460 --> 1:09:46.260\n turned green today, all these things\n\n1:09:46.260 --> 1:09:47.380\n that they bring to the table.\n\n1:09:47.380 --> 1:09:49.980\n So in a way, it is this great equalizer\n\n1:09:49.980 --> 1:09:52.540\n where people are kind of all the same in some ways.\n\n1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:58.580\n Yeah, I feel like people sometimes, class, money,\n\n1:09:58.660 --> 1:10:02.900\n fame, power, makes you for a time forget\n\n1:10:02.900 --> 1:10:06.300\n that you're just a meat vehicle.\n\n1:10:06.300 --> 1:10:09.780\n And just as good and just as bad\n\n1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:13.220\n as the other meat vehicles all around you.\n\n1:10:14.100 --> 1:10:18.180\n In that sense, there's this question sometimes raised,\n\n1:10:18.180 --> 1:10:20.300\n are some people better than others?\n\n1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:24.740\n And I usually answer no to that question because of that.\n\n1:10:24.740 --> 1:10:26.620\n Yeah, some people might be better at math,\n\n1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:29.540\n some people might be better at music.\n\n1:10:29.540 --> 1:10:31.760\n But in the end, we're just meat bags.\n\n1:10:33.300 --> 1:10:35.020\n Beautiful as we are.\n\n1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:39.820\n There's a poem that just, a small tangent I want to take,\n\n1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:44.820\n I just saw it, Just Acting, that you have written.\n\n1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:49.980\n I have to, would you classify it as a poem?\n\n1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:50.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:54.740\n At first, if I may read it, at first you enter the clinic,\n\n1:10:54.740 --> 1:10:57.500\n shoulders weighed down by white coat pockets,\n\n1:10:57.500 --> 1:11:01.780\n book stuffed, timid, you act out a role,\n\n1:11:01.780 --> 1:11:05.660\n your white coat, a costume, your questions, a script,\n\n1:11:05.660 --> 1:11:08.380\n your demeanor, a rehearsed act.\n\n1:11:08.380 --> 1:11:10.540\n No one is going to buy this.\n\n1:11:10.540 --> 1:11:13.860\n But then, as you play the role again and again,\n\n1:11:13.860 --> 1:11:16.300\n repeating the lines and the motions,\n\n1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:17.980\n the script slowly dissolves\n\n1:11:17.980 --> 1:11:20.900\n and the interaction becomes thoughtless.\n\n1:11:20.900 --> 1:11:24.300\n And the rehearsed act slowly fades into a profession.\n\n1:11:24.300 --> 1:11:26.980\n You suddenly find yourself unable to tell\n\n1:11:26.980 --> 1:11:31.140\n if you're still acting or if you're doing it for real.\n\n1:11:31.140 --> 1:11:33.620\n And now you're a doctor.\n\n1:11:33.620 --> 1:11:36.260\n Jonathan Reisman, MD, Harvard,\n\n1:11:36.260 --> 1:11:38.060\n Massachusetts General Hospital of Medicine\n\n1:11:38.060 --> 1:11:39.980\n and Pediatrics Department.\n\n1:11:39.980 --> 1:11:44.140\n Beautiful, so that is what it is to be a doctor.\n\n1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:45.420\n You're just acting.\n\n1:11:45.420 --> 1:11:46.460\n Fake it till you make it.\n\n1:11:46.460 --> 1:11:48.140\n Exactly, fake it till you make it.\n\n1:11:48.140 --> 1:11:50.420\n And I think, I imagine every medical student\n\n1:11:50.420 --> 1:11:53.020\n has this feeling when they first go into a room.\n\n1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:56.100\n Like I talked about asking this nice old lady\n\n1:11:56.100 --> 1:11:58.420\n about the color of her poop for the first time\n\n1:11:58.420 --> 1:12:00.300\n and you're just like, what am I doing here?\n\n1:12:00.300 --> 1:12:02.660\n Like, does she believe I'm a doctor?\n\n1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:04.580\n You know, this just feels absurd.\n\n1:12:04.580 --> 1:12:07.800\n But then it's, again, ho hum, becomes normal.\n\n1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:12.740\n Now there's not a sperm chapter in your book.\n\n1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:17.940\n You mentioned offline that this is a second and a third book\n\n1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:19.660\n that you're working on all about sperm.\n\n1:12:19.660 --> 1:12:21.320\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:22.720\n But, or maybe I'm not.\n\n1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:26.940\n Humor tends to make way for reality.\n\n1:12:26.940 --> 1:12:31.940\n So the tweet was that a human, an average human male\n\n1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.120\n produces 500 billion sperm, I believe,\n\n1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:39.340\n which is about four to five times more\n\n1:12:39.340 --> 1:12:42.840\n than the number of people who have ever lived.\n\n1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:45.740\n And each of those sperm is genetically unique\n\n1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:48.680\n so you can think of them, you can kind of imagine\n\n1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:51.040\n the possible humans they could have created.\n\n1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:53.140\n And they're all different.\n\n1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:54.600\n They have similarities, of course,\n\n1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:57.720\n but they have peculiarities that make them different.\n\n1:12:57.720 --> 1:12:59.500\n And you can think of all the different trajectories,\n\n1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:02.580\n all the Einsteins, the Feynmans, the Hitlers,\n\n1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:08.200\n and all the people who would have died during childbirth,\n\n1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:09.960\n would have died early in their years\n\n1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:11.320\n given the different diseases.\n\n1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:13.280\n It's fascinating to think about.\n\n1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:17.080\n An average human, yeah, we're all winners\n\n1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:19.080\n of a very competitive race.\n\n1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:23.880\n So the people who make it, we're winners, hashtag winning.\n\n1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:28.880\n Is there something that you find fascinating,\n\n1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.600\n interesting, beautiful, ugly, surprising about sperm?\n\n1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:43.240\n I think sperm is, yes, it is a very interesting bodily fluid.\n\n1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:45.400\n Maybe I'll write about it in a second or third book,\n\n1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:49.000\n we'll see, but I guess sperm is interesting\n\n1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.440\n because it's kind of the only projectile bodily fluid\n\n1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:54.540\n from the body.\n\n1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:57.600\n Vomit can be projectile.\n\n1:13:57.600 --> 1:13:59.000\n Usually that's a diseased state.\n\n1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.400\n That's not the expected kind of normal healthy state.\n\n1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:03.840\n Oh, sneezing, would you classify that or no?\n\n1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:06.920\n True, I guess it's, yeah, there's some particles in the air.\n\n1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:11.760\n I guess it's not a fluid, I mean, not a liquid, but true.\n\n1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:13.840\n I mean, cough, in addition to sneeze, right?\n\n1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:16.200\n Sneeze is how our nose gets rid of something\n\n1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:17.040\n that shouldn't be there.\n\n1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:18.480\n Cough is how our lungs get rid of something\n\n1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:19.400\n that shouldn't be there.\n\n1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:20.880\n Vomiting is sometimes how our stomachs\n\n1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:22.900\n get rid of something that shouldn't be there.\n\n1:14:22.900 --> 1:14:25.440\n All projectiles sometimes in their own way.\n\n1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:26.680\n Sperm is sort of interesting.\n\n1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:28.920\n It's created with the food for its journey.\n\n1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:31.620\n Sperm mostly feed off of fructose, a kind of sugar,\n\n1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:34.120\n for the few days that they live inside\n\n1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:35.840\n the female genital tract.\n\n1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:38.160\n But it's sort of, I like comparing our genitals\n\n1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.520\n to the genitals of the plant world, which is flowers,\n\n1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:44.600\n and in the same way that a touch me not, for instance,\n\n1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:46.720\n the kind of flower where when you brush up against it,\n\n1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:48.940\n it sort of launches seeds into the distance\n\n1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:53.640\n to try to survive in a way kind of the sperm\n\n1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:54.740\n is doing something similar,\n\n1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:56.680\n launched into the female genital tract,\n\n1:14:56.680 --> 1:14:58.980\n and then all trying to find this,\n\n1:14:58.980 --> 1:15:01.600\n competing against each other to find this egg.\n\n1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:02.440\n It's really amazing.\n\n1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:05.160\n And when you learn about it from the biological perspective,\n\n1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:09.440\n the most amazing thing is how many things can go wrong,\n\n1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:11.880\n just in the sperm not surviving long enough\n\n1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:13.600\n for it making it to the egg,\n\n1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:17.720\n and then some genetic abnormality causing a miscarriage.\n\n1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:21.280\n It's sort of astounding that it works as often as it does,\n\n1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:23.360\n and I think the lesson there is just that\n\n1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:26.520\n people have a lot of sex, and so statistics just favor\n\n1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:29.280\n it's gonna work out a good number of times.\n\n1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:31.720\n Yeah, and there might be intelligence in the design\n\n1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:33.940\n of just the sheer number of sperm.\n\n1:15:33.940 --> 1:15:35.480\n Maybe that's yet another way\n\n1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:38.640\n to inject variety into the system.\n\n1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.320\n And redundancy, I guess.\n\n1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:42.680\n We have two kidneys, we have two hands.\n\n1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:44.560\n If we lose one, we can still go on.\n\n1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:47.880\n We have however many millions of sperm\n\n1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:50.160\n get sort of launched in every ejaculation\n\n1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:54.360\n is if a bunch fail or don't make it inside.\n\n1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:56.200\n There's papers on this, by the way,\n\n1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:57.780\n that I read for some reason.\n\n1:15:57.780 --> 1:16:00.300\n Not read, but skimmed for some reason,\n\n1:16:00.300 --> 1:16:04.400\n which is talking about which sperm usually wins.\n\n1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:06.160\n Like what are the characteristics of sperms\n\n1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:09.280\n that are winning, and it's not the fastest.\n\n1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:13.400\n So apparently there's some kind of slaughter\n\n1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:15.340\n that happens early on, people will correct me,\n\n1:16:15.340 --> 1:16:17.260\n but it's not the fastest.\n\n1:16:17.260 --> 1:16:19.360\n There is an aspect of it's the luckiest.\n\n1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:21.360\n It really is, like the body tries\n\n1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:23.400\n to make it a random selection.\n\n1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:27.920\n It tries to make it fair in making it as random as possible.\n\n1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:29.520\n Interesting, and also interesting\n\n1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:30.760\n that they're fueled by fructose.\n\n1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.320\n I didn't really think about that.\n\n1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:37.280\n So they're a carb loaded athlete.\n\n1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:38.860\n Right, with food for the journey.\n\n1:16:38.860 --> 1:16:40.520\n Food for the journey, because I'm somebody\n\n1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:43.640\n that actually does a lot of running on,\n\n1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:46.400\n I guess you would call me a fat adapted athlete.\n\n1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:51.200\n So I do sort of meat heavy diet.\n\n1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:53.860\n And so you could do a lot of endurance kind of stuff\n\n1:16:53.860 --> 1:16:56.500\n when you don't need any carbs, any glucose,\n\n1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:58.000\n any of that kind of stuff.\n\n1:16:58.000 --> 1:16:59.960\n And you're very low.\n\n1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.900\n It's interesting to think that sperm are like,\n\n1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:04.120\n nope, they're total bros.\n\n1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:08.480\n Let's go to the gym, sprint, performance,\n\n1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:11.360\n short term performance is everything.\n\n1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:16.360\n All right, well, that sperm, returning to the liver,\n\n1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:20.440\n the place that deals with all our poor decisions.\n\n1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:21.840\n No.\n\n1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:22.680\n Many of them.\n\n1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:24.060\n Many of our poor decisions.\n\n1:17:24.060 --> 1:17:29.060\n Is there, you said that the liver does quite a few things.\n\n1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:33.000\n What to you is fascinating, beautiful about the liver?\n\n1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.880\n I'd say it's primary function seems to be\n\n1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:40.240\n as the sort of gatekeeper for what we eat and absorb.\n\n1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:42.920\n You know, the entire gastrointestinal tract\n\n1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:45.840\n from the esophagus to the rectum,\n\n1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:48.720\n the blood flows from it, not back to the heart,\n\n1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:51.920\n but to the liver where it's first examined,\n\n1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:55.680\n kind of things are evaluated, packaged,\n\n1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:59.480\n you know, processed, detoxified, perhaps.\n\n1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:01.180\n It's kind of this great overseer\n\n1:18:01.180 --> 1:18:03.880\n of what we digest and absorb.\n\n1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:07.680\n And so it kind of keeps track of what's coming in,\n\n1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:09.640\n you know, the outside world that comes in\n\n1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:11.860\n and will become part of us.\n\n1:18:11.860 --> 1:18:14.600\n You know, that's why partly the liver suffers\n\n1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:19.240\n sometimes the injury from certain toxins like alcohol.\n\n1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:21.720\n But beyond that, the liver is also the place,\n\n1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:23.760\n as I said, it metabolizes things too.\n\n1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:25.680\n So it metabolizes alcohol\n\n1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:27.360\n and why it can be injured by alcohol.\n\n1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.320\n It metabolizes drugs like Tylenol,\n\n1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:33.640\n which is why Tylenol can be very toxic to the liver\n\n1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:35.080\n when taken as an overdose.\n\n1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:38.520\n So the liver, you know, even beyond that,\n\n1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:42.080\n the liver produces a lot of different, you know,\n\n1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:43.540\n things that float in the bloodstream.\n\n1:18:43.540 --> 1:18:46.240\n It packages cholesterol and fats\n\n1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:48.080\n and sends them to where they're needed.\n\n1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:50.080\n It deals with protein in the blood.\n\n1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:51.880\n It deals with clotting factors in the blood,\n\n1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:54.960\n helping the blood clot, you know,\n\n1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:57.360\n processes things like bilirubin and other things\n\n1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:58.440\n that really, as I mentioned,\n\n1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:00.440\n is like 15 organs wrapped into one.\n\n1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:02.840\n Maybe that's why it's sort of the biggest internal organ.\n\n1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:06.280\n The skin's bigger, but it's not an internal organ.\n\n1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:10.320\n Right, the biggest organ in the human body is the skin.\n\n1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:13.060\n Right, but the liver's the biggest internal organ\n\n1:19:13.060 --> 1:19:15.960\n and it really is a powerhouse and does a lot,\n\n1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:18.600\n which is why when people suffer from liver failure,\n\n1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:20.560\n kind of everything goes wrong in a way.\n\n1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:24.020\n And in terms of replacing organs,\n\n1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:28.320\n what are organs that are easily replaceable,\n\n1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:29.840\n which are not?\n\n1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:31.800\n Like on the list of things that are hard to replace\n\n1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:34.800\n and not, what would you put in number one?\n\n1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:37.200\n What would you put like at the bottom?\n\n1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:39.600\n Well, I'd say the kidneys are, you know, nothing's easy,\n\n1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:41.840\n but kidneys are easiest in a way.\n\n1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:44.040\n Partly, I mean, maybe a big factor there\n\n1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:45.520\n is that other people have two of them\n\n1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:46.480\n and can give one to you.\n\n1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:47.980\n So you don't have to wait for people to die,\n\n1:19:47.980 --> 1:19:50.000\n which is the case with hearts and livers.\n\n1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000\n Sometimes you can take a part of a liver\n\n1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.400\n from someone who's alive\n\n1:19:53.400 --> 1:19:57.100\n and the liver does have this kind of mythological ability\n\n1:19:57.100 --> 1:19:59.240\n to regenerate itself.\n\n1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:03.080\n In the myth of Prometheus, he's chained to a rock\n\n1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:04.880\n and the bird eats his liver every day\n\n1:20:04.880 --> 1:20:06.880\n and it grows back every day.\n\n1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:10.160\n And that's actually biologically accurate.\n\n1:20:10.160 --> 1:20:11.760\n Not that you can completely get rid of it\n\n1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:12.640\n and it'll appear again,\n\n1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:15.100\n but when pieces of it are removed or injured,\n\n1:20:15.100 --> 1:20:17.300\n it does regenerate itself pretty amazingly.\n\n1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.160\n So I'd say the kidneys,\n\n1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:21.960\n the fact that there are more around,\n\n1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:24.200\n also it's, you know, the kidney is a smaller organ.\n\n1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:27.320\n It's often just, you don't have to put a transplanted kidney\n\n1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:29.360\n where the kidney should be in the back of the abdomen.\n\n1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:31.680\n You can just kind of stuff it into the pelvis there\n\n1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:32.760\n because it's a smaller organ.\n\n1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:34.860\n The liver would be hard because it's huge.\n\n1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:38.120\n And I guess we just have the most experience\n\n1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:41.920\n with kidney transplants because they are the most common.\n\n1:20:41.920 --> 1:20:46.440\n And the heart and the brain are probably quite difficult.\n\n1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:49.500\n Brain, as far as I know, hasn't been successfully done.\n\n1:20:49.500 --> 1:20:51.080\n The heart is done.\n\n1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:55.360\n And definitely I've evaluated a lot of patients\n\n1:20:55.360 --> 1:20:56.920\n with a heart transplant.\n\n1:20:56.920 --> 1:20:58.200\n It does work pretty well.\n\n1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:00.520\n The mechanical heart substitutes\n\n1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:03.660\n are also advancing quite rapidly these days.\n\n1:21:03.660 --> 1:21:04.720\n For a failing heart,\n\n1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:06.240\n there are certain kinds of devices\n\n1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:08.320\n they can surgically implant.\n\n1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:10.960\n Like when a failing heart isn't able to push hard enough,\n\n1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:13.120\n you know, that's the heart's job is pushing blood\n\n1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:15.600\n with sufficient pressure to create blood pressure.\n\n1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:17.820\n When it fails, there are actually these devices\n\n1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:21.500\n you can strap onto the heart to help it pump harder.\n\n1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:23.180\n Those are rapidly advancing.\n\n1:21:23.180 --> 1:21:25.320\n Many of those were not available even 10 years ago\n\n1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:29.280\n when I got out of med school and now they're commonly used.\n\n1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:31.200\n So maybe heart transplant won't be as necessary\n\n1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:34.480\n in the future if those mechanical things do advance.\n\n1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:37.160\n And as I said, the heart is basically a mechanical pump.\n\n1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:39.200\n So perhaps it would be the easiest organ\n\n1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:41.880\n to replace with some mechanical device.\n\n1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:43.600\n Now for something completely different,\n\n1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:45.040\n returning to testicles for a time.\n\n1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:50.040\n You posted a Instagram post of testicles as food.\n\n1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:54.260\n Perhaps eating them doesn't help libido\n\n1:21:54.260 --> 1:21:58.200\n because ingested testosterone is totally metabolized\n\n1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:01.160\n in the liver, returning to our liver,\n\n1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:03.440\n leaving none to reach the bloodstream.\n\n1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:06.440\n That is why testosterone only comes as injection\n\n1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:10.360\n or topical foam, not as pills.\n\n1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:14.180\n On the other hand, estrogen and progesterone\n\n1:22:14.180 --> 1:22:17.360\n can be absorbed orally, hence the pill.\n\n1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:19.760\n But testosterone is mostly responsible\n\n1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:21.420\n for libido in women too.\n\n1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:23.640\n I was not expecting for this biology lesson\n\n1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:28.440\n when I was looking at an Instagram picture of,\n\n1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:30.000\n are we looking at testicles?\n\n1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:30.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:34.160\n Are these like, which species?\n\n1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:36.360\n I believe all those are from cows.\n\n1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:37.560\n From cows, cow testicles.\n\n1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:39.880\n Cows are technically female, so bulls.\n\n1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:43.760\n Yeah, well, speaking of which, just we'll jump around a bit,\n\n1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:47.720\n but you've also traveled the world quite a bit.\n\n1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:52.720\n What is the craziest food you've eaten across the world?\n\n1:22:56.280 --> 1:22:58.800\n What have you learned about the extremes\n\n1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:02.800\n of the culinary arts by traveling the world?\n\n1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:07.720\n I would say, I guess I've always been extra fascinated\n\n1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:11.600\n with the diets of natives of the far north.\n\n1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:15.300\n I spent some time there in Russia and in Alaska\n\n1:23:15.300 --> 1:23:18.440\n and always loved their diet.\n\n1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:21.520\n So when I worked in Alaska in emergency room\n\n1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:24.040\n and did some other travels in Arctic Alaska,\n\n1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:27.760\n and they eat a lot of fat.\n\n1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:29.940\n Traditionally before contact,\n\n1:23:29.940 --> 1:23:33.000\n more than half of all calories in the Inupiat Eskimo diet\n\n1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.120\n came from blubber, marine mammal fat,\n\n1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:38.600\n or also fat from fish, fat from ducks\n\n1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:41.640\n and other birds that go up there to mate in the summer.\n\n1:23:41.640 --> 1:23:43.440\n So things like raw whale blubber\n\n1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:48.120\n was especially interesting for me and very exciting.\n\n1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:52.240\n You know, I had some beluga whale chowder, things like that.\n\n1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:55.900\n There's just all these very unusual dishes.\n\n1:23:55.900 --> 1:23:58.720\n You know, there's a dish called Mikiyak,\n\n1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:03.340\n which is whale meat fermented in whale blood,\n\n1:24:03.340 --> 1:24:05.000\n which is quite delicious actually.\n\n1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:08.320\n So is it cooked, is it eaten raw?\n\n1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:09.520\n How do they like their fat?\n\n1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:14.520\n Like in the same way up north in Russia, as you mentioned.\n\n1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:16.760\n So they often eat it raw.\n\n1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:19.100\n So the raw whale blubber is called Muktuk\n\n1:24:20.140 --> 1:24:22.040\n and it's often just sliced thin\n\n1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:25.560\n and it's sort of cold, but not frozen often when they eat it\n\n1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:26.820\n and they slice it thin.\n\n1:24:26.820 --> 1:24:30.100\n And a lot of people assume it would be very chewy,\n\n1:24:30.100 --> 1:24:31.360\n but it's not that chewy.\n\n1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:32.480\n It's quite pleasant actually\n\n1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:36.280\n and has this kind of sea smell to it as you're eating it.\n\n1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:37.180\n I quite like it.\n\n1:24:37.180 --> 1:24:40.340\n And what's the culinary culture like?\n\n1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:45.680\n Meaning, is it just source of energy or is it art?\n\n1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:47.520\n Well, there's, you know, traditionally,\n\n1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:51.600\n there's not a lot of cooking in the Arctic.\n\n1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:53.160\n A lot of things are eaten raw,\n\n1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:56.720\n partly because there's not a lot of fuel for making fires.\n\n1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:58.160\n So they will, you know,\n\n1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:01.240\n some of the big rivers in Russia, for instance,\n\n1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.700\n that flow north, they will bring trees,\n\n1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:05.800\n you know, dead trees and logs up to the north\n\n1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:07.680\n and they can get some wood that way.\n\n1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:09.580\n And same thing in some of the rivers\n\n1:25:09.580 --> 1:25:12.860\n kind of flowing northward from the Brooks Range of Alaska.\n\n1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:14.020\n You do get some trees,\n\n1:25:14.020 --> 1:25:18.200\n but just not enough to really produce a culinary art\n\n1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.740\n that requires cooking with heat.\n\n1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:24.000\n You know, they do have traditionally blubber lamps\n\n1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.320\n where the blubbers of seals and whales are used\n\n1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:28.280\n to create a little flame.\n\n1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:31.440\n Often that's for light and for a little bit of heat\n\n1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:34.580\n and less for cooking.\n\n1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:37.200\n But eating things raw is definitely a huge part\n\n1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:38.040\n of the culture there.\n\n1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:40.220\n And while I was, I went on a whale hunting trip\n\n1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:44.720\n out on the spring ice in the Arctic Ocean by Barrow, Alaska.\n\n1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:48.840\n And two of the guys, the Inupiat guys who had invited me\n\n1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:51.480\n were kind of talking about how eating things raw\n\n1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:53.480\n is sort of the most essential characteristic\n\n1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:54.880\n of Inupiat culture.\n\n1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:56.920\n And the one guy who's half white, half Inupiat,\n\n1:25:56.920 --> 1:25:59.160\n said people often doubt his ethnicity\n\n1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:00.680\n because he looks like a white guy.\n\n1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:04.360\n So he'll, you know, bite the head off of a raw bird\n\n1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:07.320\n to show them that he is truly Inupiat, is what he said.\n\n1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:09.080\n That's how you prove you're legit.\n\n1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:11.080\n We're looking at an Instagram pic.\n\n1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:14.060\n As a doctor, I was used to knowing fat\n\n1:26:14.060 --> 1:26:17.120\n as the most maligned of all body parts\n\n1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:19.520\n and the culprit in an obesity epidemic.\n\n1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:23.000\n But in Arctic Alaska, fat has always meant\n\n1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.720\n health and survival.\n\n1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:27.280\n In fact, the entire story of life in the Arctic,\n\n1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:30.720\n especially human life, is basically a tale of fat.\n\n1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:33.560\n And in Barrow, what's A.K.?\n\n1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:34.400\n Alaska.\n\n1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:35.360\n Alaska, okay.\n\n1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:39.160\n A lawn covered with a whale blubber\n\n1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:42.440\n is still equivalent of a plush green lawn\n\n1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:46.980\n in temperature suburbia, swelling in its owner with pride.\n\n1:26:46.980 --> 1:26:48.120\n And that's what we're looking at,\n\n1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:51.780\n is a lawn full of whale blubber.\n\n1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:55.000\n A beautiful, and this, so this is,\n\n1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.800\n I mean, there's a lot of calories there.\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:57.640\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:26:57.640 --> 1:26:58.880\n And this can feed a lot of people.\n\n1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:01.220\n A lot of energy, a lot of warmth.\n\n1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:03.280\n Absolutely, and it's delicious.\n\n1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:06.960\n This was like, I was a kid in a candy store, basically.\n\n1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:08.480\n I rounded a corner in Barrow.\n\n1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:10.120\n So when people do get a whale\n\n1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:12.120\n during the spring whaling season,\n\n1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:14.020\n they raise a flag or the whaling captain\n\n1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:15.520\n raises a flag over his house\n\n1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:18.680\n and everyone in town is welcome to come try some.\n\n1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:21.600\n And so before I went inside to try some,\n\n1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:23.960\n I was kinda playing around with blubber\n\n1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:26.320\n and I saw the, this is a bowhead whale.\n\n1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:29.260\n I saw its heart, which was huge,\n\n1:27:29.260 --> 1:27:31.560\n like the size of a yoga ball.\n\n1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:33.800\n And that was, for me, just like amazing.\n\n1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:35.560\n I spent probably the next 45 minutes\n\n1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:37.080\n just looking at all aspects of it.\n\n1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:39.640\n And the stump of aorta that was attached to it\n\n1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:41.880\n was the size of my thigh.\n\n1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:43.660\n That was really fascinating.\n\n1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:46.080\n It's similar Alaska and Northern Russia,\n\n1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:48.160\n like Siberia and out there.\n\n1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:49.480\n So where were you?\n\n1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:53.960\n I think you have some pics from that time.\n\n1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:55.540\n Where were you in Russia?\n\n1:27:55.540 --> 1:27:58.480\n So I spent a lot of time in kind of Western Russia as well,\n\n1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:02.160\n but I did take two trips to Kamchatka,\n\n1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.380\n including Northern Kamchatka.\n\n1:28:04.380 --> 1:28:06.640\n I didn't go far enough,\n\n1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:08.280\n I didn't go to Chukotka, for instance,\n\n1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:11.160\n until more recently when I was a ship doctor\n\n1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:15.640\n on a wildlife cruise that sailed from Anadyr, Russia,\n\n1:28:15.640 --> 1:28:18.500\n up to, through the Bering Strait into Wrangell Island.\n\n1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:21.440\n And we stopped in some villages in Chukotka\n\n1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:25.220\n and I got a chance to try some whale and stuff like that.\n\n1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:27.740\n Northern Kamchatka, where it's more the Koryak\n\n1:28:27.740 --> 1:28:29.240\n are the indigenous people.\n\n1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:30.480\n They do a lot of seal hunting,\n\n1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:31.640\n so I had a lot of seal blubber,\n\n1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:35.540\n but I don't believe they do any whale hunting quite there.\n\n1:28:35.540 --> 1:28:38.020\n But the Chukchi in a way are sort of, you know,\n\n1:28:38.020 --> 1:28:42.320\n similar to the Inupiat in their diet and their life ways.\n\n1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:44.460\n Of course, everyone's diet, all these people's diet\n\n1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:47.040\n has changed dramatically in the last 100 years,\n\n1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:48.440\n as it has for actually everyone\n\n1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:50.760\n living in kind of modern societies.\n\n1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:52.600\n But for them, perhaps more than anyone else\n\n1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:54.680\n since their diet was the most extreme,\n\n1:28:54.680 --> 1:28:57.520\n I think of any human culture on earth.\n\n1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:01.080\n Just to stay on the wild travel you did,\n\n1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:03.440\n and I should say, I'm using the word travel,\n\n1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:07.940\n but it really, you were a doctor there.\n\n1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:13.080\n Well, first of all, can you just comment on the decision\n\n1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:17.200\n to go to such places and to help people,\n\n1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:18.280\n to be a doctor there?\n\n1:29:18.280 --> 1:29:19.480\n What was the motivation?\n\n1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:20.980\n What was the thinking behind it?\n\n1:29:20.980 --> 1:29:22.660\n Well, I think I got the travel bug\n\n1:29:22.660 --> 1:29:25.120\n before I ever went to medical school\n\n1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:26.780\n and even wanted to be a doctor.\n\n1:29:26.780 --> 1:29:31.280\n So right after college, I kind of wasn't very into college,\n\n1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:33.960\n didn't enjoy things, kind of wanted to get out there\n\n1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:36.560\n and see the world, get out of New York City\n\n1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:38.780\n where I was a student at NYU.\n\n1:29:39.780 --> 1:29:42.160\n The first thing I did after finishing college\n\n1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:45.560\n was I was invited to be an intern at a research center\n\n1:29:45.560 --> 1:29:47.300\n in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\n1:29:47.300 --> 1:29:49.180\n I spent six months there on my first trip\n\n1:29:49.180 --> 1:29:52.560\n and went back four more times to Russia,\n\n1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:55.840\n traveled all over, including to Kamchatka twice\n\n1:29:55.840 --> 1:29:57.680\n and other parts of the country.\n\n1:29:57.680 --> 1:30:00.680\n I'd never heard of cities like Petrozavodsk\n\n1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:02.680\n and Syktyvkar and Pskov.\n\n1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:05.720\n I didn't even know a word could start with P, S, K,\n\n1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:07.680\n like the city of Pskov, but it can.\n\n1:30:08.860 --> 1:30:10.920\n And I was sort of fascinated.\n\n1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:12.880\n I was actually studying\n\n1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.960\n the international environmental movement\n\n1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:16.560\n and how it came to Russia\n\n1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:18.520\n after the fall of the Soviet Union\n\n1:30:18.520 --> 1:30:20.280\n and how organizations like Greenpeace\n\n1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:23.200\n and World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank\n\n1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.140\n are trying to kind of push the timber industry,\n\n1:30:27.140 --> 1:30:29.920\n which is huge in Russia, toward a more sustainable path.\n\n1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:32.860\n And so I was sort of evaluating how is it working?\n\n1:30:32.860 --> 1:30:34.280\n If not, why not?\n\n1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:36.320\n And that seems like such a little niche,\n\n1:30:36.320 --> 1:30:38.880\n such a small detail about Russian society,\n\n1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:41.600\n but in a way, researching that in depth\n\n1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:44.680\n was almost this window into the entire country\n\n1:30:44.680 --> 1:30:46.920\n and the history in a place I knew nothing about.\n\n1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:50.760\n And I learned the language, traveled all over the country,\n\n1:30:50.760 --> 1:30:53.040\n got to know the food, the history, the literature.\n\n1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:55.320\n It was just an immersive and amazing\n\n1:30:55.320 --> 1:30:56.640\n and life changing experience\n\n1:30:56.640 --> 1:31:01.080\n that made me want to see every spot on the globe, basically,\n\n1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:03.080\n and learn about every culture.\n\n1:31:03.080 --> 1:31:06.240\n So I took that desire with me to medical school.\n\n1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:08.400\n I decided I would go to medical school.\n\n1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:10.120\n And from the very beginning,\n\n1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:13.320\n I was intent on traveling around the world.\n\n1:31:13.320 --> 1:31:16.200\n So a lot of my career has been fashioned\n\n1:31:16.200 --> 1:31:18.360\n so that I'm practicing medicine in a place\n\n1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:20.520\n with an interesting geographic context,\n\n1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:24.400\n an interesting place with an interesting cultural context.\n\n1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:27.520\n And that just makes it more interesting, I find.\n\n1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:29.960\n Not only are medical services often more needed\n\n1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:32.800\n in these remote and rural parts of the country and world,\n\n1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:35.560\n so I feel like I'm taking my knowledge\n\n1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:38.580\n and education experience to places where it's needed,\n\n1:31:38.580 --> 1:31:39.420\n but also for me,\n\n1:31:39.420 --> 1:31:41.920\n it's just such an enlightening experience,\n\n1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:44.940\n the way culture, history, geography, climate\n\n1:31:44.940 --> 1:31:46.600\n affects medical disease,\n\n1:31:46.600 --> 1:31:47.880\n but just getting to know the people,\n\n1:31:47.880 --> 1:31:49.700\n getting to know their culture,\n\n1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:51.480\n being a very useful traveler\n\n1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:54.760\n by providing medical services in that place.\n\n1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:57.360\n And that's taken me to Arctic Alaska,\n\n1:31:57.360 --> 1:31:59.440\n to Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota.\n\n1:31:59.440 --> 1:32:01.400\n I currently work in a few different parts\n\n1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:02.960\n of Pennsylvania, Appalachia,\n\n1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:06.860\n which for me is a unique geography and culture\n\n1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:08.920\n that I didn't grow up with, wasn't familiar with.\n\n1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:12.480\n So in some ways, it's exotic for me as well.\n\n1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:16.680\n I worked in other places too, like Kolkata, India, Nepal.\n\n1:32:16.680 --> 1:32:20.600\n Just I think my love of travel has shaped my medical career\n\n1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:23.500\n and being a doctor does give you these opportunities\n\n1:32:23.500 --> 1:32:27.120\n to go to places and travel in a unique way\n\n1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:28.760\n through the medical profession.\n\n1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:31.340\n You know, there's a documentary,\n\n1:32:31.340 --> 1:32:34.280\n Happy People Here in the Taiga or something like that.\n\n1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:39.600\n I think Warner Herzog voices it.\n\n1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:43.880\n It tells a story of a simple life of survival in the taiga\n\n1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:47.200\n and I think they're trapping for food\n\n1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:51.760\n and there's an alcoholism problem too as well.\n\n1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:56.760\n There's like a very basic life of survival,\n\n1:32:57.560 --> 1:32:59.560\n of loneliness, of desperation,\n\n1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:03.240\n but also there's a, I think the underlying claim\n\n1:33:04.940 --> 1:33:09.940\n of the documentary is that that simple life\n\n1:33:09.940 --> 1:33:12.660\n that simple life actually has a kind\n\n1:33:12.660 --> 1:33:17.660\n of simple happiness to it, hence the name Happy People.\n\n1:33:20.540 --> 1:33:24.900\n Can you speak to the life that people live in those places\n\n1:33:24.900 --> 1:33:28.660\n when it may be simpler than you would\n\n1:33:28.660 --> 1:33:31.220\n in a sort of big city life?\n\n1:33:32.540 --> 1:33:36.100\n It's definitely very different for sure.\n\n1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:38.740\n You know, I guess I found like in some\n\n1:33:38.740 --> 1:33:41.260\n of the remote villages of Kamchatka,\n\n1:33:41.260 --> 1:33:44.760\n I was actually surprised how similar they were\n\n1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:48.860\n in that I saw the same family strife,\n\n1:33:48.860 --> 1:33:53.860\n the same fights, the same kind of pairing of relationships\n\n1:33:55.020 --> 1:33:58.140\n and bickering and politics.\n\n1:33:58.140 --> 1:34:01.060\n In a way, I'm from the New Jersey suburbs\n\n1:34:01.060 --> 1:34:05.700\n and being in this remote village of Northern Kamchatka,\n\n1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:07.240\n I remember writing an email to my friend\n\n1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:08.980\n about how just it seemed so similar,\n\n1:34:08.980 --> 1:34:12.540\n even though on the surface it was this exotic other world,\n\n1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:15.540\n the incredible material know how they must have\n\n1:34:15.540 --> 1:34:17.540\n to get their food from the land.\n\n1:34:17.540 --> 1:34:19.980\n You know, that the number of animal species,\n\n1:34:19.980 --> 1:34:22.260\n plant species, the behaviors of the animals,\n\n1:34:22.260 --> 1:34:25.220\n seasons, how to live that way.\n\n1:34:25.220 --> 1:34:27.000\n In a way, it's more complicated in a way\n\n1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.620\n that I find fascinating how people live on the land\n\n1:34:29.620 --> 1:34:31.420\n and the knowledge and experience it takes\n\n1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:33.380\n to do it well and survive.\n\n1:34:33.380 --> 1:34:35.900\n You know, obviously other aspects of modern life\n\n1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:38.820\n in a city are much more complicated\n\n1:34:38.820 --> 1:34:41.100\n than they would be there, but I guess it's,\n\n1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:42.420\n that was something that struck me too,\n\n1:34:42.420 --> 1:34:43.740\n that it's simpler in some ways,\n\n1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:45.820\n but more complicated in other ways.\n\n1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:48.500\n So some of the complexity that happens in life\n\n1:34:48.500 --> 1:34:52.060\n is originated from humans, not from the technology\n\n1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:54.280\n or all that kind of stuff around us.\n\n1:34:55.500 --> 1:34:57.220\n You can take the human out of modernity,\n\n1:34:57.220 --> 1:34:58.380\n but they're still human.\n\n1:34:58.380 --> 1:35:01.080\n They're still human, and they fill the empty space\n\n1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:03.340\n with their own human complexities.\n\n1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:07.220\n Are there people that just stand out,\n\n1:35:07.220 --> 1:35:11.520\n memorable people, memorable experiences from those places?\n\n1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:18.220\n Some people that maybe made you smile, made you cry,\n\n1:35:19.020 --> 1:35:21.200\n changed who you are as a man, changed who you are\n\n1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:24.100\n as a doctor, anything jumps to mind?\n\n1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:26.180\n I think, you know, when I was, it was interesting,\n\n1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:29.800\n when I was in Russia, I found that most of the people\n\n1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:31.780\n I hung out with were old women.\n\n1:35:31.780 --> 1:35:32.840\n I'm not sure why.\n\n1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:36.060\n I mean, actually I didn't meet a lot of old men in Russia,\n\n1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:39.520\n which might speak to kind of life expectancy there\n\n1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:41.140\n for men in particular.\n\n1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:44.380\n But I found women, older Russian women,\n\n1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:46.980\n including, you know, Russian from St. Petersburg\n\n1:35:46.980 --> 1:35:49.860\n or some of the elderly women in Kamchatka,\n\n1:35:49.860 --> 1:35:51.580\n who were, you know, some were Koriak,\n\n1:35:51.580 --> 1:35:55.320\n some were half Koriak, half Russian, some were Chukchi.\n\n1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:58.060\n I just found them to be so enlightening\n\n1:35:58.060 --> 1:36:02.000\n the way they talked about history, about people,\n\n1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:03.900\n so insightful about humanity, you know,\n\n1:36:03.900 --> 1:36:05.860\n all they've lived through in the last 50 years\n\n1:36:05.860 --> 1:36:07.940\n in some of these parts of Russia,\n\n1:36:07.940 --> 1:36:10.400\n like the upheaval, societal upheaval,\n\n1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:12.480\n the destruction, the building up.\n\n1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:15.820\n It's just something I could not even imagine.\n\n1:36:15.820 --> 1:36:18.500\n And I think their insights were just very,\n\n1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:19.940\n I'm not thinking of anything in particular,\n\n1:36:19.940 --> 1:36:21.840\n but I just remember I could listen\n\n1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:24.140\n to some of these elderly women talk about their lives\n\n1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:25.400\n for hours and hours.\n\n1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:26.860\n I remember there was this older,\n\n1:36:26.860 --> 1:36:31.300\n elderly blind Koriak woman who you would have thought\n\n1:36:31.300 --> 1:36:34.140\n was the, you know, most country bumpkin of country bumpkin,\n\n1:36:34.140 --> 1:36:35.580\n and yet she couldn't stop talking about\n\n1:36:35.580 --> 1:36:38.380\n how much she loved reading Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,\n\n1:36:38.380 --> 1:36:41.680\n which might also speak to the Soviet education system.\n\n1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:43.860\n And it was just sort of surprising and fascinating,\n\n1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:46.920\n and just those stories and perspectives on life\n\n1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:48.780\n really stayed with me.\n\n1:36:48.780 --> 1:36:52.260\n Yeah, with babushki.\n\n1:36:53.740 --> 1:36:57.440\n There's a wisdom, there's a kindness.\n\n1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:02.440\n I mean, I suppose that's true for older people in general,\n\n1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:09.440\n but there's something about, it's not just Russia,\n\n1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:14.440\n it's Eastern Europe, it's like this kind of look of wisdom,\n\n1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:22.320\n and not just like sort of middle class wisdom\n\n1:37:22.460 --> 1:37:23.720\n or something like that.\n\n1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:28.720\n It's like I have seen some shit wisdom, I've seen it all.\n\n1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:35.120\n And on the other side, I'm left here with a pragmatism\n\n1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:39.680\n and a compassion, and also an ability to cook really well.\n\n1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:41.520\n That's for sure, absolutely.\n\n1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:44.880\n There's just this balance of just deep intelligence\n\n1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:49.880\n and deep kindness, and yeah, I mean I part much of who I am\n\n1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:53.080\n is because of the relationship I had with my grandmother\n\n1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:58.080\n who was a Russian, Ukrainian born Russian grandmother.\n\n1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:03.820\n Did you learn the Russian language?\n\n1:38:03.820 --> 1:38:05.880\n I did, it's quite rusty at this point,\n\n1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:10.160\n but I did, one of these wonderful elderly Russians\n\n1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:12.600\n in St. Petersburg sort of adopted me.\n\n1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:15.200\n I think that was another thing that a lot of these\n\n1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:18.200\n elderly women on every side of the country\n\n1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:21.760\n kind of adopted me or saw me as this real curiosity.\n\n1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:26.320\n This was around 2002, 2003, it just wasn't common\n\n1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.520\n for this sort of strange American to suddenly show up\n\n1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:32.120\n in the middle of Kamchatka or even St. Petersburg,\n\n1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:34.840\n and just absolutely ravenously curious\n\n1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:36.520\n about everything they had to say.\n\n1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:40.240\n So I often got adopted and one of them taught me Russian\n\n1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:44.880\n and how to ride a horse, so the same babushka\n\n1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:46.640\n taught me both of those things.\n\n1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:48.680\n And like you said also, I should mention\n\n1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:51.180\n that there's something about the Soviet education system\n\n1:38:51.180 --> 1:38:54.680\n where yeah, everybody reads Tolstoy, Dostoevsky,\n\n1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:56.640\n it's exceptionally well read.\n\n1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:58.560\n No matter where life has taken you,\n\n1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:00.320\n no matter where you come from,\n\n1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:02.880\n the literature, the mathematics, the sciences,\n\n1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:06.520\n they're all like extremely well educated\n\n1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:10.080\n and that creates a fascinating populace.\n\n1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:15.180\n Like then you take that education,\n\n1:39:15.180 --> 1:39:18.400\n that excellent early education,\n\n1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:22.080\n and you throw a bunch of hardship at those people\n\n1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:26.420\n and then they kind of cook in that hardship\n\n1:39:26.420 --> 1:39:29.320\n and come out really fascinating people on the other end.\n\n1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:32.600\n It makes me surprised sort of that, for instance,\n\n1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:35.820\n like Russian medical science is not,\n\n1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:38.920\n doesn't, you don't see a lot of sort of studies,\n\n1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:41.160\n medical studies, advancing of medical science\n\n1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:42.440\n come out of Russia.\n\n1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:44.680\n It's just sort of, I'm surprised sort of,\n\n1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:45.920\n I wish that it would.\n\n1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:49.440\n I visited Akademgorodok outside Novosibirsk,\n\n1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:51.340\n which is an entire city the Soviets created\n\n1:39:51.340 --> 1:39:52.600\n just for the study of science\n\n1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:54.520\n and it's like there's the geology building\n\n1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:55.920\n and there's the biology building\n\n1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:57.460\n and there's the chemistry building\n\n1:39:57.460 --> 1:40:00.360\n and I just feel like Russia has this potential\n\n1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:03.120\n to be a science powerhouse or even in the medical sciences\n\n1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:05.660\n but I guess you just, I don't see it.\n\n1:40:05.660 --> 1:40:07.680\n I'm not sure why.\n\n1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:10.600\n I mean, you can certainly guess as to why\n\n1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:13.640\n and I see the same thing in the other,\n\n1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:15.880\n in the sciences I hold the dearest sort of,\n\n1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:19.600\n in computer science, in engineering fields.\n\n1:40:20.780 --> 1:40:25.060\n I kind of long held this desire, by long,\n\n1:40:25.060 --> 1:40:27.060\n I mean, last couple of years\n\n1:40:27.060 --> 1:40:29.440\n because a bunch of people reached out to me\n\n1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:33.080\n from Yandex and Moscow State to give lectures there\n\n1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:34.320\n to sort of connect.\n\n1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:37.720\n You know, why so little science is coming out of there?\n\n1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:41.500\n Why so little that we hear about?\n\n1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:42.640\n And it feels like we should be able\n\n1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:44.800\n to bridge the scientific community.\n\n1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:49.740\n Like science, let's even say,\n\n1:40:49.740 --> 1:40:53.680\n even in turmoil of geopolitics, even in global conflict,\n\n1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:56.720\n I feel like science should be bigger than that.\n\n1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:00.400\n But why do we not hear from the scientists\n\n1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:03.480\n is because of the limitations on human freedoms,\n\n1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:05.060\n on scientific freedoms.\n\n1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:09.120\n I feel like in China, in Russia,\n\n1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.080\n in any regime of its sort, you should give freedom\n\n1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:19.080\n to scientists to flourish and to interact with others\n\n1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:20.880\n and you can only grow from that.\n\n1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:22.280\n You shouldn't suppress that.\n\n1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:27.400\n The sort of Cold War ideas, we should put those aside.\n\n1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:31.160\n As somebody who spent time in Russia,\n\n1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:34.120\n as somebody who learned Russian,\n\n1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:38.600\n do you have some thoughts that you want to say\n\n1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:40.400\n about the war in Ukraine currently?\n\n1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:43.440\n It's tragic, of course.\n\n1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:47.520\n Seemingly pointless to watch the destruction\n\n1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:48.940\n of a country in real time.\n\n1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:53.800\n I guess it's, you know, when you read Russian history\n\n1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:55.840\n and Ukrainian history, I guess it just,\n\n1:41:55.840 --> 1:41:59.960\n it's sort of, you know, destruction is a big part of it.\n\n1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:02.780\n The populace being beaten down is a big part of it,\n\n1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:05.600\n you know, from the Mongolian hordes\n\n1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:09.160\n through the Tsar and the Soviets and Putin.\n\n1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:11.680\n I guess, you know, it's just,\n\n1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:13.520\n in science in particular, medical science,\n\n1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:15.920\n it feels like this sort of unrealized potential.\n\n1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:18.160\n You know, the culture is so beautiful,\n\n1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:20.600\n the people are so smart and well educated.\n\n1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:23.100\n I think the word unrealized potential\n\n1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:24.400\n is kind of how I feel.\n\n1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:27.580\n That's why I wanted to celebrate that part of the world\n\n1:42:27.580 --> 1:42:29.380\n is there's so many beautiful people,\n\n1:42:29.380 --> 1:42:31.040\n so many brilliant people.\n\n1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:33.640\n And I just happen to know the language\n\n1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:36.520\n so I'm able to appreciate the beauty of those people.\n\n1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:38.680\n I'm sure the same is true in China.\n\n1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:40.760\n I'm sure, that's one of the things that makes me sad\n\n1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:44.680\n is there's all these cultures that I don't know about.\n\n1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:46.400\n I can't fully appreciate their brilliance.\n\n1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:48.640\n Even Japan and places like that\n\n1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:52.280\n that are sort of, there's channels of communication\n\n1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:54.240\n wide open and there's a lot of interaction.\n\n1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:56.300\n It's still, not knowing the language,\n\n1:42:56.300 --> 1:42:58.640\n I feel like I miss some of the culture.\n\n1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:01.920\n Or Portuguese and, you know, looking at South America\n\n1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:03.760\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:06.920\n But anyway, in Russia there certainly is\n\n1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:08.400\n that unrealized potential.\n\n1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:12.060\n In Ukraine, so many brilliant scientists,\n\n1:43:12.060 --> 1:43:14.520\n engineers came from Ukraine, from Russia.\n\n1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:18.500\n And I hope they get to flourish soon.\n\n1:43:18.500 --> 1:43:20.220\n And I hope we put this,\n\n1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.740\n I hope we stop this war, because all war is hell.\n\n1:43:29.140 --> 1:43:31.720\n Is there something to comment about the biology\n\n1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:36.720\n of war, is there echoes of the emergency room experience?\n\n1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:46.760\n Have you dealt with patients\n\n1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:48.560\n that have been touched by war time?\n\n1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:53.200\n Definitely, war and medicine has a very intricate\n\n1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:54.920\n and complex relationship.\n\n1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:57.120\n I don't know if it was Walt Whitman who said it,\n\n1:43:57.120 --> 1:43:59.520\n though he was a nurse during the Civil War,\n\n1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:01.480\n that war is the best medical school.\n\n1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:03.820\n But some people have said that.\n\n1:44:03.820 --> 1:44:08.720\n And even advancements in medicine come from war.\n\n1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:12.200\n The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have, in some ways,\n\n1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:14.180\n really revolutionized certain aspects\n\n1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:15.920\n of the way we treat trauma patients\n\n1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:17.640\n in the civilian world as well.\n\n1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:20.080\n The importance of tourniquets,\n\n1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:22.160\n the importance of transfusing whole blood\n\n1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:25.300\n instead of red blood cells isolated from serum\n\n1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:27.040\n and platelets, et cetera.\n\n1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:29.240\n The importance of pain control in the battlefield,\n\n1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:30.520\n that's changed dramatically.\n\n1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:32.300\n Everything from ketamine injections\n\n1:44:32.300 --> 1:44:35.600\n to fentanyl lollipops in the battlefield.\n\n1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:39.080\n So war has really improved medicine in many ways.\n\n1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:42.640\n In another way, the Department of Defense\n\n1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:44.520\n spends a lot of money on medical research\n\n1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:46.800\n and really pushes the envelope.\n\n1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:50.120\n DARPA is one aspect of the military budget\n\n1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:52.780\n that really funds these moonshot experiments\n\n1:44:52.780 --> 1:44:56.720\n that are really fascinating and really push the frontiers\n\n1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:00.720\n more than seemingly most kind of universities\n\n1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:04.280\n doing doctors and researchers doing their research.\n\n1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:06.860\n So in a way, the space program,\n\n1:45:06.860 --> 1:45:08.520\n which sort of was military initially\n\n1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:10.400\n then became civilian under NASA,\n\n1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:13.600\n also has led to a lot of advances and understandings\n\n1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:16.840\n of health on Earth and in space.\n\n1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:20.560\n So the military or war in general is a huge way\n\n1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:23.080\n that medicine advances,\n\n1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:25.560\n not to mention the epidemics that come.\n\n1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:28.480\n My grandmother was from what's today Moldova,\n\n1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:29.680\n what was then Romania.\n\n1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:33.240\n She got typhus during World War II.\n\n1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:35.520\n So there's typhus outbreaks, there's cholera outbreaks,\n\n1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:38.920\n you know, all these, even infectious disease things\n\n1:45:38.920 --> 1:45:40.960\n can advance in war, which you wouldn't expect.\n\n1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:43.660\n You expect sort of trauma to be the sort of main problem,\n\n1:45:43.660 --> 1:45:45.920\n but actually infection is a huge problem\n\n1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:46.980\n throughout history and war.\n\n1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:48.660\n So we can learn a lot.\n\n1:45:48.660 --> 1:45:51.380\n It's this kind of horrific natural experiment\n\n1:45:51.380 --> 1:45:53.760\n in medical care.\n\n1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:56.400\n Yeah, and I've recently been reading about\n\n1:45:56.400 --> 1:45:59.200\n some of the horrific medical experiments\n\n1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:03.640\n performed by Nazi scientists, Nazi Germany.\n\n1:46:03.640 --> 1:46:05.800\n I'll talk about it another time perhaps,\n\n1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:10.800\n but nothing reveals the honesty of human biology like war.\n\n1:46:13.180 --> 1:46:16.260\n Just to stay on your wild journeys for a little bit longer,\n\n1:46:17.700 --> 1:46:19.980\n you have a tweet about Shackleton saying,\n\n1:46:19.980 --> 1:46:22.400\n here's a photo of Shackleton's medical kit\n\n1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:26.360\n from his storied expedition to Antarctica in the 1910s.\n\n1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:30.000\n Some perigoric for pain, some laxative.\n\n1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.880\n Only the essentials.\n\n1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:36.560\n Would you put laxative under the essentials?\n\n1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:38.280\n Anyway, sorry to interrupt.\n\n1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:44.040\n When I worked as a ship doctor in Antarctica in 2018,\n\n1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:48.640\n I had a huge cabinet full of meds and even EKG machine.\n\n1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:53.640\n So if you can comment sort of on that contrast.\n\n1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.640\n First of all, your own journey, how harsh was it?\n\n1:46:56.640 --> 1:46:58.360\n How difficult was it?\n\n1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:02.640\n And given that context, can you think about\n\n1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:05.280\n how hard Shackleton's journey was?\n\n1:47:06.400 --> 1:47:09.760\n I think the difference is unimaginably stark.\n\n1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:11.720\n One thing I do wanna point out is that\n\n1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:14.240\n the use of laxatives early in the 20th century\n\n1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:17.720\n and before that, they were used for a surprising\n\n1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:21.100\n number of ailments where they probably did not help at all.\n\n1:47:21.100 --> 1:47:23.640\n But I think that was a holdover from sort of\n\n1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:26.080\n the old theory of medicine, the humoral theory\n\n1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:28.720\n where you have to balance the fluids in the body.\n\n1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:30.480\n And so causing people to vomit,\n\n1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:34.000\n causing them to have diarrhea or purposely taking blood\n\n1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.760\n out of them in bloodletting was a big part.\n\n1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:38.960\n And I think that crazy use of laxatives\n\n1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:41.800\n was maybe a holdover from that time.\n\n1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:44.600\n But that being said, they were probably not eating\n\n1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:47.120\n very high fiber food on that expedition.\n\n1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:49.800\n So perhaps laxatives could have been helpful.\n\n1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:54.320\n There's a lot of seal, penguin and seal meat being eaten,\n\n1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:56.840\n which is not super high in fiber.\n\n1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.560\n So I don't wanna discount the importance\n\n1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:00.320\n of laxatives in that setting.\n\n1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:02.120\n But that wouldn't be the essential thing.\n\n1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:04.980\n If you're thinking of a tiny kit\n\n1:48:04.980 --> 1:48:09.240\n that has only the essentials, I mean pain, yes.\n\n1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:11.600\n Laxatives, I don't know, maybe not.\n\n1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.720\n I think the medical kit possibilities\n\n1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:16.260\n were much narrower back then.\n\n1:48:16.260 --> 1:48:18.600\n This was before antibiotics,\n\n1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:22.520\n before I think germ theory might've been,\n\n1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:25.440\n it was known, but there wasn't much to do about it.\n\n1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:27.640\n So the availability of medicines,\n\n1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:29.040\n I mean, that's something that exploded\n\n1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:30.440\n over the course of the 20th century.\n\n1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:33.240\n So what I can put in a backpack today\n\n1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:35.580\n filled with modern medications, whether injectable\n\n1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:39.700\n or to be taken orally is just many orders of magnitude\n\n1:48:39.700 --> 1:48:42.400\n greater than what they had back then.\n\n1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:46.520\n So when I went, my expedition was nothing like Shackleton's.\n\n1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:51.520\n I was on a huge cruise ship with 160 Japanese passengers\n\n1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:53.720\n who came with their own translators.\n\n1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:58.280\n And as I said, I had cabinets, not just one cabinet,\n\n1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:00.520\n many cabinets full of medications,\n\n1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:04.800\n both injectable, some patches, some pills.\n\n1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:08.640\n I was very impressed actually with what was available there.\n\n1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:11.160\n And I didn't have to use a lot of it, thankfully,\n\n1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:13.120\n though I did use some of it for people.\n\n1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:19.080\n And I slept and I got free room and board on the ship.\n\n1:49:19.080 --> 1:49:22.440\n So every Southern summer cruise ships\n\n1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:24.680\n go take people to Antarctica,\n\n1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:26.760\n the Southern Atlantic islands like the Falklands\n\n1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:29.200\n and other parts of the South Pacific.\n\n1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:30.580\n And then in the Northern summer,\n\n1:49:30.580 --> 1:49:34.160\n the same kind of cruise ship explosion happens\n\n1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:36.440\n going to Greenland and Iceland and Svalbard\n\n1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:40.360\n and Franz Josef Land and other parts of the North Alaska.\n\n1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.900\n So, and every ship needs a doctor.\n\n1:49:42.900 --> 1:49:44.800\n So it's a great opportunity.\n\n1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:48.680\n They want specifically ER doctors to deal with emergencies,\n\n1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:51.920\n but you're really working in the middle of nowhere.\n\n1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:55.000\n And all you have is the medications there on the ship\n\n1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.600\n and supplies and your knowledge and experience.\n\n1:49:57.600 --> 1:49:59.840\n And so it's a very different experience\n\n1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:02.000\n than working in a high tech modern hospital\n\n1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:03.340\n with every bit of technology\n\n1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:06.520\n and every sub specialist consultant available.\n\n1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:08.120\n But I sort of liked that challenge.\n\n1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:09.720\n I mean, I like going to the ends of the earth.\n\n1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:12.920\n It's beautiful, it's exciting, it's fascinating.\n\n1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:15.820\n Practicing medicine in those settings is extra challenging\n\n1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:18.720\n and really makes you hone some of your skills,\n\n1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:22.320\n which is part of the reason that I sought them out.\n\n1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:25.160\n Do you see echoes of some of that same effort?\n\n1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:27.400\n I've gotten a chance to interact with astronauts\n\n1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:30.800\n and those kinds of folks working on space missions.\n\n1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:34.800\n Do you see some of those same echoes of challenging efforts\n\n1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:37.800\n going out into space and maybe landing on Mars\n\n1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:42.240\n and maybe beginning to build a small colony on Mars?\n\n1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:44.560\n Yeah, I think the healthcare that is needed\n\n1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:46.080\n will be a big part of that.\n\n1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:47.960\n Obviously, we're probably gonna send\n\n1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:49.880\n overall quite healthy people,\n\n1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:51.640\n but there's a lot of medical decisions to make\n\n1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:54.600\n about what should be brought, what should be expected.\n\n1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:57.320\n To some extent, I've had a lot of doctors say,\n\n1:50:57.320 --> 1:50:58.720\n oh my goodness, I can't believe you work\n\n1:50:58.720 --> 1:50:59.540\n in the middle of nowhere.\n\n1:50:59.540 --> 1:51:02.280\n What do you do if someone gets a brain bleed,\n\n1:51:02.280 --> 1:51:04.460\n like falls, hits their head, needs a neurosurgeon?\n\n1:51:04.460 --> 1:51:06.620\n I mean, the obvious answer is they die.\n\n1:51:06.620 --> 1:51:09.540\n You know, when you're in the middle of Antarctica,\n\n1:51:09.540 --> 1:51:11.340\n things kill you that wouldn't\n\n1:51:11.340 --> 1:51:13.640\n if you're inside a university hospital\n\n1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:16.860\n that's fully equipped to help with every problem that arises.\n\n1:51:16.860 --> 1:51:20.360\n Mars takes that to a crazy extreme, obviously.\n\n1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:22.140\n I know that even going to Antarctica,\n\n1:51:22.140 --> 1:51:24.320\n different countries have had different strategies.\n\n1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:28.380\n I believe it was Australia used to kind of just,\n\n1:51:28.380 --> 1:51:31.780\n in anticipation, remove people's gallbladders\n\n1:51:31.780 --> 1:51:33.580\n just so that it wouldn't get inflamed\n\n1:51:33.580 --> 1:51:36.060\n because that is a very common medical emergency.\n\n1:51:36.060 --> 1:51:37.980\n So they would just remove it beforehand,\n\n1:51:37.980 --> 1:51:39.780\n even though it was not diseased at all,\n\n1:51:39.780 --> 1:51:41.420\n just so that while they're stuck in Antarctica\n\n1:51:41.420 --> 1:51:44.660\n over the winter, for instance, that wouldn't be a problem.\n\n1:51:44.660 --> 1:51:47.300\n You know, there's many other issues that can arise.\n\n1:51:47.300 --> 1:51:49.700\n But so those are some decisions to make.\n\n1:51:49.700 --> 1:51:51.140\n Maybe the people who go into Mars\n\n1:51:51.140 --> 1:51:52.440\n should have their appendix removed,\n\n1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:53.860\n their gallbladder removed.\n\n1:51:53.860 --> 1:51:55.280\n Maybe they should have a cardiac cath\n\n1:51:55.280 --> 1:51:56.940\n to see if they have coronary artery disease\n\n1:51:56.940 --> 1:51:59.040\n just to know their chances of getting a heart attack there.\n\n1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:00.660\n Though it's not always predictive.\n\n1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:01.740\n You know, it's hard to predict\n\n1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:02.720\n who's gonna get a heart attack,\n\n1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:05.020\n but maybe with all the data around today,\n\n1:52:05.020 --> 1:52:06.740\n we'll get better at predicting.\n\n1:52:06.740 --> 1:52:07.940\n But that will be a huge part.\n\n1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:09.300\n You know, we can't have people,\n\n1:52:09.300 --> 1:52:11.700\n the few pioneers in a Mars colony\n\n1:52:11.700 --> 1:52:13.100\n dying of heart attacks and things like that.\n\n1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:13.940\n Don't anticipate stuff.\n\n1:52:13.940 --> 1:52:15.620\n Would you go?\n\n1:52:15.620 --> 1:52:18.620\n You've gone to some harsh conditions to be a doctor.\n\n1:52:18.620 --> 1:52:21.180\n Would you go to Mars to be a doctor?\n\n1:52:21.180 --> 1:52:24.660\n It would definitely be amazing, I think,\n\n1:52:24.660 --> 1:52:26.580\n because I have a wife and two small children,\n\n1:52:26.580 --> 1:52:30.460\n probably not in the cards for me at this point, but.\n\n1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:33.140\n You humans with your human attachments.\n\n1:52:33.140 --> 1:52:35.140\n Sex and death.\n\n1:52:35.140 --> 1:52:39.220\n If you just put more priority on the death than the sex,\n\n1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:42.420\n I think we would be better off.\n\n1:52:42.420 --> 1:52:44.020\n No.\n\n1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:45.020\n I would love to go to Mars.\n\n1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:45.900\n And actually, you know,\n\n1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:48.540\n I practice high altitude medicine in Nepal.\n\n1:52:48.540 --> 1:52:50.540\n Space medicine is sort of an extension of that.\n\n1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:53.260\n You know, the air is just much thinner, like nonexistent.\n\n1:52:53.260 --> 1:52:54.980\n You know, as you go higher in the mountains,\n\n1:52:54.980 --> 1:52:56.700\n the things that happen to human physiology\n\n1:52:56.700 --> 1:52:59.100\n are very bizarre and strange\n\n1:52:59.100 --> 1:53:01.980\n and still not well explained by science.\n\n1:53:01.980 --> 1:53:04.300\n And in space, it's just like a crazy extension\n\n1:53:04.300 --> 1:53:05.340\n of high altitude.\n\n1:53:07.140 --> 1:53:10.100\n If I could just return to the, we didn't really,\n\n1:53:10.100 --> 1:53:13.260\n I think we mentioned a little bit about the food you had.\n\n1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:15.500\n Just if we can high level say,\n\n1:53:15.500 --> 1:53:18.620\n what is the greatest meal you've ever had?\n\n1:53:18.620 --> 1:53:21.020\n So your last meal, let's go.\n\n1:53:21.020 --> 1:53:26.020\n If one more meal, I get to murder you after this.\n\n1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:27.100\n This is your last day.\n\n1:53:27.100 --> 1:53:28.180\n We get to spend it together.\n\n1:53:28.180 --> 1:53:29.580\n Where in the world would you go?\n\n1:53:29.580 --> 1:53:30.820\n What would you eat?\n\n1:53:30.820 --> 1:53:35.820\n I would say the most delicious thing is bone marrow.\n\n1:53:36.180 --> 1:53:38.100\n And I would love a full meal of bone marrow\n\n1:53:38.100 --> 1:53:39.980\n for my last, last dish.\n\n1:53:39.980 --> 1:53:43.060\n I did on my birthday in 2002,\n\n1:53:43.060 --> 1:53:46.740\n ate a kilogram and a half of crab meat in Kamchatka.\n\n1:53:46.740 --> 1:53:50.220\n And that was also amazingly delicious.\n\n1:53:50.220 --> 1:53:52.500\n The king crab they have there is incredible.\n\n1:53:52.500 --> 1:53:54.860\n But I would go with bone marrow,\n\n1:53:54.860 --> 1:53:57.900\n which is I think just one of the most delicious foods.\n\n1:53:57.900 --> 1:53:59.820\n And it's sort of this weird body part.\n\n1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:01.980\n You know, it's basically all your stem cells,\n\n1:54:01.980 --> 1:54:03.260\n not all of them, but the stem cells\n\n1:54:03.260 --> 1:54:04.940\n that produce all your blood cells.\n\n1:54:04.940 --> 1:54:07.580\n So they are spitting out billions of white blood cells,\n\n1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:09.700\n red blood cells and platelets every day.\n\n1:54:09.700 --> 1:54:12.500\n And there's a bunch of fat in there as well.\n\n1:54:12.500 --> 1:54:14.380\n Just one of the places the body stores fat.\n\n1:54:14.380 --> 1:54:17.300\n And so you basically add heat and that's all you need.\n\n1:54:17.300 --> 1:54:18.700\n It's like the perfect food.\n\n1:54:18.700 --> 1:54:19.540\n You add heat.\n\n1:54:19.540 --> 1:54:22.180\n The fat for frying the stem cells is already there.\n\n1:54:22.180 --> 1:54:25.460\n There's naturally a bone vessel to contain it all.\n\n1:54:25.460 --> 1:54:27.580\n Probably add some flavor too.\n\n1:54:27.580 --> 1:54:29.100\n It's like the perfect food.\n\n1:54:29.100 --> 1:54:32.500\n Does it matter which animal?\n\n1:54:33.300 --> 1:54:35.700\n I prefer a larger animal just so there's more of it.\n\n1:54:35.700 --> 1:54:37.300\n I actually like, well that's true.\n\n1:54:37.300 --> 1:54:39.140\n I actually really like sort of bone marrow\n\n1:54:39.140 --> 1:54:40.660\n from like chicken bones.\n\n1:54:40.660 --> 1:54:42.540\n Right, just sucking it out of the bone.\n\n1:54:42.540 --> 1:54:46.660\n Yes, I'm known for leaving absolutely nothing edible\n\n1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:48.820\n on the plate except bone itself.\n\n1:54:48.820 --> 1:54:53.820\n There's one other human I know that loves bone marrow\n\n1:54:54.620 --> 1:54:57.100\n as much as you do and that's Joe Rogan.\n\n1:54:57.100 --> 1:55:01.460\n So go, it's unnatural how much that man loves bone marrow.\n\n1:55:01.460 --> 1:55:02.420\n I understand why.\n\n1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:03.260\n It's amazing.\n\n1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:04.100\n I love the steak part.\n\n1:55:04.100 --> 1:55:07.580\n The bone marrow, you know what, let me argue with you\n\n1:55:07.580 --> 1:55:12.100\n because I don't know, it could be an acquired taste\n\n1:55:12.100 --> 1:55:16.340\n but there's just too much, it's like too much\n\n1:55:17.540 --> 1:55:19.220\n with too little work for it.\n\n1:55:20.380 --> 1:55:23.700\n Like it's as if you gave me lobster meat\n\n1:55:23.700 --> 1:55:27.540\n without the lobster having to clean the lobster.\n\n1:55:27.540 --> 1:55:30.540\n I just feel like I'm spoiling myself.\n\n1:55:30.540 --> 1:55:33.460\n So it's very fatty, it's, I don't know,\n\n1:55:33.460 --> 1:55:36.140\n maybe I wanna work for something that tastes like that.\n\n1:55:36.140 --> 1:55:37.540\n Well if you start from the whole animal,\n\n1:55:37.540 --> 1:55:39.300\n you do have to work to get at it, right?\n\n1:55:39.300 --> 1:55:43.220\n A lot of animals have the teeth and the jaw muscles\n\n1:55:43.220 --> 1:55:45.020\n to chomp through bone, we do not.\n\n1:55:45.020 --> 1:55:49.300\n So when you buy it from the store, it's already sawed up\n\n1:55:49.300 --> 1:55:52.220\n but I've definitely gotten marrow out of deer bones\n\n1:55:52.220 --> 1:55:55.260\n with a hatchet, just chop off the fat end\n\n1:55:55.260 --> 1:55:56.500\n and start spooning it out.\n\n1:55:56.500 --> 1:55:59.020\n Or maybe I'll revisit it, that's fascinating.\n\n1:55:59.020 --> 1:56:01.820\n And where, where would you eat it?\n\n1:56:01.820 --> 1:56:04.180\n Where and which place of the world?\n\n1:56:04.180 --> 1:56:08.940\n Is there something about who cooks it, who you eat it with?\n\n1:56:10.740 --> 1:56:12.340\n You're not allowed to pick your family.\n\n1:56:12.340 --> 1:56:13.180\n Right.\n\n1:56:13.180 --> 1:56:14.020\n Uh.\n\n1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:14.860\n Uh.\n\n1:56:14.860 --> 1:56:15.700\n Uh.\n\n1:56:15.700 --> 1:56:17.340\n Uh.\n\n1:56:17.340 --> 1:56:21.340\n So like which place in the world, rural or in the city,\n\n1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:22.460\n those kinds of things, you've been\n\n1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:24.260\n to so many fascinating places.\n\n1:56:25.780 --> 1:56:28.180\n I would say I'm, Antarctica I would say\n\n1:56:28.180 --> 1:56:31.260\n is one of the most picturesque places I've ever been.\n\n1:56:31.260 --> 1:56:34.900\n I really did not, I didn't know how mountainous it was\n\n1:56:34.900 --> 1:56:37.220\n and I guess I knew there'd be ice\n\n1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:39.540\n but just I didn't know how much ice it was.\n\n1:56:39.540 --> 1:56:42.140\n You know, it's ice and mountains just overwhelming.\n\n1:56:42.140 --> 1:56:45.180\n I just, you know, as kind of overwhelming bone marrow\n\n1:56:45.180 --> 1:56:48.160\n might seem to you, sort of that feast for your eyes.\n\n1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:51.680\n And just ice in general is amazing,\n\n1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:54.040\n like the icebergs floating around Antarctica\n\n1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:56.640\n is just astounding, like the different shapes,\n\n1:56:56.640 --> 1:56:59.560\n the sizes are incredible.\n\n1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:02.120\n There's actually a, I believe it's a US Navy website\n\n1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:03.960\n that tracks the largest icebergs\n\n1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:06.480\n and you can read about each of them and how big they are\n\n1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:10.080\n and just the formations you see, similar up near Greenland,\n\n1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:12.560\n though I have not been to Greenland.\n\n1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:14.380\n Just ice in general is just amazing.\n\n1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:16.280\n So I could just look at its different forms\n\n1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:18.560\n while eating bone marrow forever, until you kill me,\n\n1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:19.400\n that is.\n\n1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:21.560\n Yeah, and afterwards we go.\n\n1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:23.920\n There's back to the death, the death and sex.\n\n1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:26.880\n What is it about the ice?\n\n1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:29.720\n Is it sort of the enormity of nature\n\n1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:33.360\n that just reminds you that it's going to be there\n\n1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:35.120\n before you and after?\n\n1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:37.160\n And then you get to partake in the eating\n\n1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:41.920\n of the thing you need for maintaining of your biological,\n\n1:57:42.780 --> 1:57:44.460\n temporary biological organism?\n\n1:57:44.460 --> 1:57:47.160\n Yeah, I think it's a few things.\n\n1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:49.400\n One is just the shapes that you see,\n\n1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:53.520\n the wave action, just eating away at these pieces of ice.\n\n1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:55.940\n You get these arches and just these shapes.\n\n1:57:55.940 --> 1:57:56.780\n I mean, it's just like.\n\n1:57:56.780 --> 1:57:57.620\n Geometry.\n\n1:57:57.620 --> 1:57:59.400\n The geometry alone is amazing.\n\n1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:01.200\n I studied math as an undergrad\n\n1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:03.880\n and I've always appreciated geometry\n\n1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:07.980\n and just the shapes alone are just look like brilliant works\n\n1:58:07.980 --> 1:58:10.980\n of modernist art and just obviously no two\n\n1:58:10.980 --> 1:58:12.660\n are ever the same.\n\n1:58:12.660 --> 1:58:16.100\n Not to mention a lot of them are this unearthly blue color\n\n1:58:16.100 --> 1:58:18.960\n that is just really startling and fascinating.\n\n1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:22.920\n The same color of glaciers in various parts of the world,\n\n1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:26.260\n that blue color is just really amazing.\n\n1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:29.800\n And I also just love how it's sort of this constant shedding\n\n1:58:29.800 --> 1:58:32.120\n from our Antarctic continent, from Greenland.\n\n1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:34.480\n It's this constant process of snow falling inland\n\n1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:37.000\n and pushing the glaciers further out to sea\n\n1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:38.600\n and them breaking loose.\n\n1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:41.080\n I mean, obviously it seems to be happening faster these days,\n\n1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:43.280\n but it's sort of this constant shedding\n\n1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:45.080\n and sort of, I always like thinking about\n\n1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:46.560\n how the body has something similar.\n\n1:58:46.560 --> 1:58:48.560\n We're constantly shedding and renewing\n\n1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:51.400\n and rebuilding everything.\n\n1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:55.200\n And so ice is sort of this constant similar process.\n\n1:58:56.920 --> 1:59:00.600\n Yeah, I did not know you were a math undergrad.\n\n1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:03.640\n So that, I mean, you just keep getting more fascinating.\n\n1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:08.200\n Can you maybe take a small step into that direction?\n\n1:59:08.200 --> 1:59:11.960\n What do you find beautiful about mathematics?\n\n1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:15.520\n Why did you journey into that part of the world for a time?\n\n1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:16.680\n I liked math.\n\n1:59:16.680 --> 1:59:18.560\n I especially liked, so college math,\n\n1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:20.680\n I did some calculus in high school.\n\n1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:22.000\n When I got to college math,\n\n1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:25.200\n I was amazed that there were no more numbers.\n\n1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:26.660\n The digits disappeared.\n\n1:59:26.660 --> 1:59:29.540\n It was just variables, concepts.\n\n1:59:30.480 --> 1:59:32.300\n There was almost no more numbers at all.\n\n1:59:32.300 --> 1:59:37.300\n It was like this totally abstract kind of way of thinking.\n\n1:59:37.300 --> 1:59:39.160\n But that sort of reflects the natural world\n\n1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:40.840\n and teaches you about the natural world,\n\n1:59:40.840 --> 1:59:44.160\n though it's sort of this perfect platonic ideal,\n\n1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:45.600\n perhaps, of the natural world\n\n1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:47.840\n that can still sort of help explain\n\n1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:49.280\n what happens in the natural world.\n\n1:59:49.280 --> 1:59:53.800\n But just these concepts are so abstract from life\n\n1:59:53.800 --> 1:59:56.280\n and from the natural world.\n\n1:59:56.280 --> 1:59:58.360\n I was actually getting interested in the natural world\n\n1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:02.560\n at the same time when I was at NYU studying math.\n\n2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:05.320\n I took a tour of Central Park that was pointing,\n\n2:00:05.320 --> 2:00:07.440\n the guy, Steve Brill, was pointing out\n\n2:00:07.440 --> 2:00:09.120\n these wild edible plants.\n\n2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:11.360\n And I was learning to identify the first plants\n\n2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:13.280\n and knowing what's edible, what's not.\n\n2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:15.160\n That was totally fascinating.\n\n2:00:15.160 --> 2:00:16.800\n And sort of this kind of thing\n\n2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:18.640\n that I felt like was connecting me to nature.\n\n2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:23.160\n And it was balanced with this utterly abstract science,\n\n2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:26.600\n or utterly abstract lessons I was getting in math class\n\n2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:28.520\n where I was thinking through series.\n\n2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:31.080\n As we approach infinity, what happens to these equations?\n\n2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:34.560\n And concepts of like rings and abstract algebra,\n\n2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:37.120\n I don't know, it was just this dichotomy\n\n2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:40.080\n that I enjoyed both aspects of.\n\n2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:41.860\n Yeah, the concepts.\n\n2:00:41.860 --> 2:00:46.780\n But so different, this kind of logical,\n\n2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:52.040\n rigorous view of the world and the world of biology.\n\n2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:55.640\n Why the big, how did that feel to take the leap\n\n2:00:55.640 --> 2:01:00.640\n into the biological, the mushy mess of the human body\n\n2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:04.760\n from the mathematical, which is all very clean?\n\n2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:07.320\n Right, it does feel like a big step.\n\n2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:09.760\n I think there's more connection than you think.\n\n2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:12.520\n We talked about symmetry of the body earlier.\n\n2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:13.880\n That is a real thing.\n\n2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:18.180\n Fluid dynamics of how our various bodily fluids flow\n\n2:01:18.180 --> 2:01:20.100\n and what makes them not flow as well\n\n2:01:20.100 --> 2:01:21.600\n and what makes them flow better.\n\n2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:26.060\n All these different aspects of science go into the body.\n\n2:01:26.060 --> 2:01:31.060\n Everything from hard bone to softer kind of flesh\n\n2:01:31.980 --> 2:01:35.220\n to liquids of various consistencies.\n\n2:01:36.220 --> 2:01:38.980\n A lot of science and math does teach you\n\n2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:41.500\n about kind of how the body works, how it can work better,\n\n2:01:41.500 --> 2:01:43.860\n what happens in sort of disease states.\n\n2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:49.100\n Yeah, I suppose there's a connection.\n\n2:01:49.100 --> 2:01:54.100\n There's also kind of a sort of computational biology\n\n2:01:54.100 --> 2:01:58.540\n of this computational equivalence of each of the disciplines\n\n2:01:58.540 --> 2:02:00.740\n which are becoming more and more fascinating\n\n2:02:00.740 --> 2:02:02.780\n with all the work that DeepMind is doing\n\n2:02:02.780 --> 2:02:04.860\n and the work of genetics, all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:02:04.860 --> 2:02:06.940\n simulating different parts of the body\n\n2:02:06.940 --> 2:02:09.840\n to try to gain an intuition understanding of it.\n\n2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:12.740\n That to me is super fascinating,\n\n2:02:12.740 --> 2:02:15.260\n but sometimes it does feel like an oversimplification\n\n2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:16.620\n of the way the body really does it\n\n2:02:16.620 --> 2:02:21.620\n because the body is an incredibly weird complex system\n\n2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:25.020\n and it finds a way.\n\n2:02:25.020 --> 2:02:27.320\n The adaptability, the resilience,\n\n2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:31.140\n the redundancy that's built in, it's weird.\n\n2:02:31.140 --> 2:02:34.760\n It's incredibly powerful and so unlike\n\n2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:38.500\n the kind of computer based systems that we build,\n\n2:02:38.500 --> 2:02:41.220\n at least we engineer in the software engineering world,\n\n2:02:41.220 --> 2:02:43.820\n which kind of starts to make you think\n\n2:02:43.820 --> 2:02:47.840\n how can we engineer computer systems in a different way\n\n2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:50.540\n that make them more resilient in the real world?\n\n2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:52.580\n That's sort of the robotics question.\n\n2:02:53.900 --> 2:02:55.400\n What do you think about that?\n\n2:02:55.400 --> 2:02:59.100\n What does it take to build a humanoid robot\n\n2:02:59.100 --> 2:03:02.420\n or robots that are as resilient as the human body?\n\n2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:04.100\n How difficult do you think is that problem?\n\n2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:06.540\n Having studied the human body,\n\n2:03:06.540 --> 2:03:10.620\n how hard is the engineering problem of building systems\n\n2:03:10.620 --> 2:03:13.000\n like that guy over there, the legged guy\n\n2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.640\n that is as resilient as the human body\n\n2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:18.460\n to the harsh conditions of the real world?\n\n2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:20.860\n I think it's very hard\n\n2:03:20.860 --> 2:03:22.340\n and we definitely haven't gotten there yet.\n\n2:03:22.340 --> 2:03:23.860\n I think we could probably learn lessons\n\n2:03:23.860 --> 2:03:26.460\n from people who are trying to grow artificial organs\n\n2:03:26.460 --> 2:03:29.700\n in the lab to eventually transplant into people,\n\n2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:31.300\n which would solve a huge problem\n\n2:03:31.300 --> 2:03:33.360\n of needing to get those organs from others\n\n2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.900\n and the rejection of putting a foreign material\n\n2:03:35.900 --> 2:03:37.180\n inside your body.\n\n2:03:37.180 --> 2:03:39.340\n Your immune system tends not to like that.\n\n2:03:39.340 --> 2:03:42.700\n That has advanced a lot recently.\n\n2:03:42.700 --> 2:03:46.740\n I think some advances actually have been\n\n2:03:46.740 --> 2:03:48.980\n where we pay a lot of attention to stem cells,\n\n2:03:48.980 --> 2:03:49.940\n stem cells, stem cells.\n\n2:03:49.940 --> 2:03:51.820\n We can grow whatever we want out of stem cells,\n\n2:03:51.820 --> 2:03:54.220\n but now there's sort of a recognition\n\n2:03:54.220 --> 2:03:57.140\n that what we call the extracellular matrix,\n\n2:03:57.140 --> 2:04:00.200\n which is sort of the foundation of the body,\n\n2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:02.900\n the thing that holds all the cells into their proper shape\n\n2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:04.700\n and keeps them where they should be,\n\n2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:07.100\n that is actually crucial.\n\n2:04:07.100 --> 2:04:09.220\n And there's probably a lot of signaling that goes on.\n\n2:04:09.220 --> 2:04:11.140\n Like you stick a stem cell\n\n2:04:11.140 --> 2:04:12.760\n on the right extracellular matrix,\n\n2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:14.860\n it will turn into the kind of cell that you want\n\n2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:16.400\n and take the right shape and position\n\n2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:17.940\n and start functioning.\n\n2:04:17.940 --> 2:04:21.260\n I think that's been a huge, huge advance\n\n2:04:21.260 --> 2:04:24.640\n knowing that it's not just these celebrity stem cells\n\n2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:25.480\n that are the answer.\n\n2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:27.900\n It's this kind of part in the background,\n\n2:04:27.900 --> 2:04:29.700\n this sort of just like laying the foundation,\n\n2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:32.180\n the system that you put these cells onto.\n\n2:04:32.180 --> 2:04:33.280\n And we're not there yet,\n\n2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:35.500\n but there's definitely a lot happening,\n\n2:04:35.500 --> 2:04:36.620\n a lot of research happening.\n\n2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:39.660\n And I think there'll be some advances probably soon.\n\n2:04:39.660 --> 2:04:42.700\n So now on the topic of interaction\n\n2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:47.500\n of computational systems with biology.\n\n2:04:47.500 --> 2:04:49.620\n So if you look at a company like Neuralink\n\n2:04:49.620 --> 2:04:53.180\n or the whole effort of brain computer interfaces,\n\n2:04:53.180 --> 2:04:55.700\n now there's a neurosurgery component there.\n\n2:04:56.660 --> 2:04:59.880\n We have to connect electrical systems\n\n2:05:02.020 --> 2:05:04.460\n with biological systems.\n\n2:05:04.460 --> 2:05:08.100\n So just even the implanting is difficult.\n\n2:05:09.100 --> 2:05:11.060\n Then the communication is difficult.\n\n2:05:11.060 --> 2:05:13.660\n But what would you say from what you know about the brain,\n\n2:05:13.660 --> 2:05:15.300\n what you know about the human body\n\n2:05:15.300 --> 2:05:18.300\n and all the beautiful mess that's there,\n\n2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:20.580\n how difficult is the effort of Neuralink?\n\n2:05:20.580 --> 2:05:22.380\n Do you think it's feasible?\n\n2:05:22.380 --> 2:05:24.860\n I think it's definitely feasible.\n\n2:05:24.860 --> 2:05:27.980\n I think we need to probably know more than we do\n\n2:05:27.980 --> 2:05:31.500\n and know how to connect it in all these ways.\n\n2:05:31.500 --> 2:05:33.900\n I think some advances, for instance,\n\n2:05:34.940 --> 2:05:38.100\n much less sexy, but really already impacting medical care\n\n2:05:38.100 --> 2:05:40.300\n is something called deep brain stimulation,\n\n2:05:40.300 --> 2:05:42.260\n which is done for Parkinson's disease and others\n\n2:05:42.260 --> 2:05:45.820\n where neurosurgeons implant this device\n\n2:05:45.820 --> 2:05:48.980\n that's electrically stimulates the part of the brain\n\n2:05:48.980 --> 2:05:51.620\n that is not functioning in Parkinson's disease.\n\n2:05:51.620 --> 2:05:53.740\n And it's quite dramatic how effective it works.\n\n2:05:53.740 --> 2:05:55.220\n And I remember as a med student,\n\n2:05:55.220 --> 2:05:58.940\n watching a neurologist literally like turn the electricity\n\n2:05:58.940 --> 2:06:00.360\n up on this handheld thing,\n\n2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:03.060\n and you could see the person's Parkinson tremor go away\n\n2:06:03.060 --> 2:06:04.660\n and you could see them start to walk\n\n2:06:04.660 --> 2:06:06.640\n in a more steady fashion.\n\n2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:09.380\n And I know there's studies, there's actually studies\n\n2:06:09.380 --> 2:06:11.980\n or there may be studies in the future\n\n2:06:11.980 --> 2:06:14.140\n studying the same deep brain stimulation\n\n2:06:14.140 --> 2:06:18.420\n for everything from eating disorders to severe,\n\n2:06:18.420 --> 2:06:21.080\n like severe OCD, like paralyzing OCD,\n\n2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:23.260\n not just like I wanna wash my hands three times,\n\n2:06:23.260 --> 2:06:28.260\n but and so I think the potential is there,\n\n2:06:29.100 --> 2:06:33.500\n but I guess connecting the brain in a microscopic way\n\n2:06:33.500 --> 2:06:35.500\n in sort of a multifaceted way,\n\n2:06:35.500 --> 2:06:37.300\n there needs to be sort of a million connections\n\n2:06:37.300 --> 2:06:39.460\n or some very high number of connections\n\n2:06:39.460 --> 2:06:40.500\n for them to work fluidly.\n\n2:06:40.500 --> 2:06:43.300\n As far as I know, I'm not an expert in the area.\n\n2:06:43.300 --> 2:06:45.640\n First of all, I believe and I trust\n\n2:06:45.640 --> 2:06:47.820\n in the adaptability of the biological system\n\n2:06:47.820 --> 2:06:50.900\n to whatever crazy stuff you try to shove in there.\n\n2:06:50.900 --> 2:06:54.020\n So it's going to potentially reject things,\n\n2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:57.740\n but it's also going to, if it doesn't reject things, adapt.\n\n2:06:57.740 --> 2:07:01.860\n And if we can create computational systems that also adapt,\n\n2:07:01.860 --> 2:07:05.140\n AI systems that adapt and can kinda,\n\n2:07:05.140 --> 2:07:07.260\n both of them reach towards each other\n\n2:07:07.260 --> 2:07:08.820\n and figure stuff out.\n\n2:07:08.820 --> 2:07:12.140\n But actually our current AI systems are not very adaptable\n\n2:07:13.260 --> 2:07:15.980\n to the what, like in the wild way\n\n2:07:15.980 --> 2:07:19.540\n that biology is adaptable, like adaptable to anything.\n\n2:07:19.540 --> 2:07:21.820\n And if we can build AI systems like that,\n\n2:07:21.820 --> 2:07:24.040\n I feel like there's some interesting things you could do,\n\n2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:25.820\n but of course there's ethics\n\n2:07:25.820 --> 2:07:29.900\n and there's real human lives at stake.\n\n2:07:29.900 --> 2:07:32.860\n And there you can't quite experiment.\n\n2:07:32.860 --> 2:07:35.060\n You have to have things that work\n\n2:07:35.060 --> 2:07:38.020\n and maybe simulation can help, but reality is,\n\n2:07:40.260 --> 2:07:42.780\n it's a dangerous playground to play on.\n\n2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:45.560\n It is messy.\n\n2:07:45.560 --> 2:07:46.880\n You tweeted that quote,\n\n2:07:46.880 --> 2:07:49.720\n \"'If you look back from far enough into the future,\n\n2:07:49.720 --> 2:07:53.000\n \"'every doctor today will look like a total quack.'\"\n\n2:07:56.660 --> 2:07:58.860\n First of all, that's humbling to think about.\n\n2:08:00.100 --> 2:08:03.500\n Like we don't know what we're doing in the great,\n\n2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:05.840\n like there's been so much progress\n\n2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:07.660\n that we kinda have this confidence\n\n2:08:07.660 --> 2:08:09.500\n that we figured it all out.\n\n2:08:09.500 --> 2:08:13.100\n If you look at history and you read how people thought,\n\n2:08:13.100 --> 2:08:14.740\n I mean, there's so many moments in history\n\n2:08:14.740 --> 2:08:18.260\n where people really thought that they figured it all out.\n\n2:08:18.260 --> 2:08:21.640\n It's almost like there's nothing else left to do\n\n2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:23.760\n at every stage in history.\n\n2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:25.820\n And then you realize no,\n\n2:08:25.820 --> 2:08:30.120\n progress often happens like exponentially.\n\n2:08:30.120 --> 2:08:32.140\n And every moment you continue to think\n\n2:08:32.140 --> 2:08:33.540\n you figured it all out.\n\n2:08:33.540 --> 2:08:37.540\n But if you're being honest, if you're being humble,\n\n2:08:37.540 --> 2:08:39.500\n then you realize we're just shrouded in mystery.\n\n2:08:39.500 --> 2:08:41.620\n So what do we make of this?\n\n2:08:41.620 --> 2:08:42.860\n Like how should we feel that?\n\n2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:44.980\n How should you feel as a doctor?\n\n2:08:44.980 --> 2:08:49.020\n How should we feel as scientific explorers\n\n2:08:49.020 --> 2:08:50.100\n of the human body?\n\n2:08:50.100 --> 2:08:52.020\n The fact that we're probably going to be wrong\n\n2:08:52.020 --> 2:08:54.740\n about everything we currently know.\n\n2:08:54.740 --> 2:08:56.740\n Right, there's a saying actually,\n\n2:08:56.740 --> 2:08:58.100\n by the time you finish med school,\n\n2:08:58.100 --> 2:09:00.620\n half of what you learned is wrong,\n\n2:09:00.620 --> 2:09:02.460\n which is quite illustrative.\n\n2:09:02.460 --> 2:09:05.780\n And becoming more true as time goes on,\n\n2:09:05.780 --> 2:09:07.360\n so much medical research going on,\n\n2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:10.780\n so much learning going on, it's really wonderful in a way.\n\n2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:13.720\n But in some ways we still learn these concepts\n\n2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:14.560\n from the past.\n\n2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:17.640\n And I know when you take a test as a medical student,\n\n2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:22.100\n sometimes you know they want you to give the old answer,\n\n2:09:22.100 --> 2:09:23.380\n but you know there's a new answer\n\n2:09:23.380 --> 2:09:24.460\n because of recent science,\n\n2:09:24.460 --> 2:09:26.020\n but you know to give the old answer,\n\n2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:28.500\n that's now incorrect to get the question right on the test.\n\n2:09:28.500 --> 2:09:30.260\n That happens actually quite a bit\n\n2:09:30.260 --> 2:09:32.020\n because things change so quickly.\n\n2:09:33.340 --> 2:09:35.580\n Yet, you know, when I look back at doctors\n\n2:09:35.580 --> 2:09:38.020\n from centuries past, I mean, it's absurd\n\n2:09:38.020 --> 2:09:39.580\n what they were doing to their patients.\n\n2:09:39.580 --> 2:09:41.420\n I mean, for probably for most of human history,\n\n2:09:41.420 --> 2:09:43.300\n they were doing more harm than good.\n\n2:09:43.300 --> 2:09:46.340\n You know, they're draining people of their blood.\n\n2:09:46.340 --> 2:09:48.380\n That was, you know, bloodletting was a huge part\n\n2:09:48.380 --> 2:09:51.040\n of medical care.\n\n2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:55.300\n You know, George Washington died of a paratonsular abscess,\n\n2:09:55.300 --> 2:09:57.220\n an abscess right next to the tonsil,\n\n2:09:57.220 --> 2:09:59.220\n which has the great name of Quincy,\n\n2:09:59.220 --> 2:10:00.300\n and they bled him to death.\n\n2:10:00.300 --> 2:10:02.820\n You know, I mean, kind of adding insult to injury.\n\n2:10:02.820 --> 2:10:05.740\n Doctors are a menace and do a lot of harm.\n\n2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:07.580\n I mean, hopefully not intentionally.\n\n2:10:07.580 --> 2:10:10.740\n You know, even medical errors are still a huge problem,\n\n2:10:10.740 --> 2:10:13.660\n cause of death and morbidity.\n\n2:10:13.660 --> 2:10:16.460\n So we do a lot of things that are not great,\n\n2:10:16.460 --> 2:10:18.100\n but you know, our knowledge, yeah,\n\n2:10:18.100 --> 2:10:19.700\n it's very imperfect at this point.\n\n2:10:19.700 --> 2:10:21.520\n I do have some confidence.\n\n2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:24.980\n You know, I guess perfect scientific studies\n\n2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:29.000\n that try to get at the reality of the universe are essential\n\n2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:33.380\n because when I think of why a certain medication works\n\n2:10:33.380 --> 2:10:34.380\n for a certain condition,\n\n2:10:34.380 --> 2:10:36.140\n it might make perfect sense in my head,\n\n2:10:36.140 --> 2:10:38.980\n knowing the biology, the biochemistry, the anatomy,\n\n2:10:38.980 --> 2:10:40.820\n it makes perfect sense, it must work.\n\n2:10:40.820 --> 2:10:42.340\n I gave it to the patient, they got better,\n\n2:10:42.340 --> 2:10:44.920\n and that's happened 20 times in the last year,\n\n2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:46.700\n but it's, you know, I'm wrong.\n\n2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:48.360\n Like when you actually do a study,\n\n2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:51.180\n it actually doesn't help, maybe it hurts.\n\n2:10:51.180 --> 2:10:55.340\n And that's really, I think the way we explain medications\n\n2:10:55.340 --> 2:10:57.980\n working in our minds is often wrong\n\n2:10:57.980 --> 2:11:01.100\n when you end up finally doing the study.\n\n2:11:01.100 --> 2:11:03.780\n And some of the most interesting experiments\n\n2:11:03.780 --> 2:11:06.020\n involve what we call sham surgery.\n\n2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:08.380\n So for instance, people who injure their knee,\n\n2:11:08.380 --> 2:11:10.740\n you know, arthroscopy where an orthopedic surgeon\n\n2:11:10.740 --> 2:11:13.820\n goes in there with a scope, gets bits of bone out,\n\n2:11:13.820 --> 2:11:17.060\n shaves down the cartilage, you know, cleans things up,\n\n2:11:17.060 --> 2:11:18.140\n and it helps some people,\n\n2:11:18.140 --> 2:11:21.560\n but they actually did some studies where one group of people\n\n2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:24.620\n got the true arthroscopy and others just got sham surgery\n\n2:11:24.620 --> 2:11:26.100\n where they put them to sleep,\n\n2:11:26.100 --> 2:11:29.340\n made little cuts in the skin so they woke up with scars.\n\n2:11:29.340 --> 2:11:31.700\n And then it turned out that it's not clear\n\n2:11:31.700 --> 2:11:33.580\n arthroscopy is actually helping.\n\n2:11:33.580 --> 2:11:37.260\n And the same, there was a recent huge study\n\n2:11:37.260 --> 2:11:40.540\n of putting a stent in someone's coronary arteries\n\n2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:41.900\n if they have stable chest pain,\n\n2:11:41.900 --> 2:11:43.260\n not like I'm having a heart attack,\n\n2:11:43.260 --> 2:11:44.940\n you need a stent like right then,\n\n2:11:44.940 --> 2:11:48.040\n but, you know, kind of chronic coronary artery disease\n\n2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:50.100\n where every time I run up the stairs, I get chest pain,\n\n2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:52.580\n and then when I rest, it goes away.\n\n2:11:52.580 --> 2:11:54.620\n Like obviously you put a stent,\n\n2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:56.240\n you increase blood flow to the heart,\n\n2:11:56.240 --> 2:11:57.520\n like how could that not work?\n\n2:11:57.520 --> 2:12:00.340\n But then when they did the sham catheterization,\n\n2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:02.980\n it actually looks like it might not actually help\n\n2:12:02.980 --> 2:12:04.720\n better than the sham.\n\n2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:07.300\n So I think those placebo controlled studies are essential.\n\n2:12:07.300 --> 2:12:09.140\n I mean, it is shocking,\n\n2:12:09.140 --> 2:12:12.080\n and this has been driven home during the last two years,\n\n2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:13.540\n how hard it is to figure out\n\n2:12:13.540 --> 2:12:15.180\n what the hell's going on in the universe,\n\n2:12:15.180 --> 2:12:16.700\n especially with our bodies.\n\n2:12:16.700 --> 2:12:18.860\n Like it is really hard to get at the truth\n\n2:12:18.860 --> 2:12:21.680\n and what you think makes sense, like often turns out,\n\n2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:23.260\n I mean, the history of modern medicine\n\n2:12:23.260 --> 2:12:26.220\n is littered with examples where it made perfect sense\n\n2:12:26.220 --> 2:12:27.740\n and it seemed to help some patients,\n\n2:12:27.740 --> 2:12:31.300\n and it turns out it's not doing anything or it's harmful.\n\n2:12:31.300 --> 2:12:33.340\n Yeah, there's all kinds of narratives swimming around.\n\n2:12:33.340 --> 2:12:36.300\n We convince ourselves as a human civilization\n\n2:12:36.300 --> 2:12:37.740\n that something is true.\n\n2:12:37.740 --> 2:12:41.500\n There's a propaganda machines, there's just self delusion.\n\n2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:45.380\n There's a centralized communities,\n\n2:12:45.380 --> 2:12:47.040\n like there's a scientific community\n\n2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:48.060\n that believes a certain thing.\n\n2:12:48.060 --> 2:12:49.280\n There's the conspiracy theories\n\n2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:51.320\n that believe a certain thing.\n\n2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:52.940\n Sometimes the scientific community, right?\n\n2:12:52.940 --> 2:12:56.300\n Sometimes the conspiracy theorists are right\n\n2:12:56.300 --> 2:12:57.580\n throughout human history, I mean.\n\n2:12:57.580 --> 2:13:00.300\n And we now think the scientific community,\n\n2:13:00.300 --> 2:13:02.740\n well, now the science has really figured it out.\n\n2:13:02.740 --> 2:13:04.780\n We're way smarter than we were in the past.\n\n2:13:04.780 --> 2:13:07.020\n And then there's these like interesting studies\n\n2:13:08.260 --> 2:13:11.500\n that I've seen, I think Robin Hansen mentioned it to me,\n\n2:13:12.500 --> 2:13:16.760\n that if you look at the entirety of medication,\n\n2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:19.340\n like the effect of medication on human health,\n\n2:13:19.340 --> 2:13:21.900\n if you do those kinds of broad studies,\n\n2:13:21.900 --> 2:13:23.500\n does it actually help?\n\n2:13:24.460 --> 2:13:26.940\n Like does quality of life,\n\n2:13:26.940 --> 2:13:29.480\n lifespan, certain measures of the wellbeing,\n\n2:13:30.340 --> 2:13:34.100\n does if you, and you look at human society as a whole,\n\n2:13:34.100 --> 2:13:37.380\n does taking medication or not actually help?\n\n2:13:37.380 --> 2:13:39.860\n And those studies find there's no positive\n\n2:13:39.860 --> 2:13:42.020\n or negative effect with medication.\n\n2:13:42.020 --> 2:13:46.680\n And that's a very kind of interesting perspective.\n\n2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:51.460\n That mean you could probably argue a lot of ways,\n\n2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:55.340\n but the point is, because you can bring up\n\n2:13:56.740 --> 2:13:58.980\n literally a billion cases where medication\n\n2:13:58.980 --> 2:14:01.940\n has significant positive impact on a particular patient,\n\n2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:03.960\n but you have to kind of zoom out\n\n2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:08.020\n and honestly look at the positive effects of medicine,\n\n2:14:08.020 --> 2:14:12.540\n of lifestyle choices, diet choices, of exercise or not.\n\n2:14:12.540 --> 2:14:13.740\n Maybe we'll find eventually\n\n2:14:13.740 --> 2:14:15.740\n that exercise is actually bad for you.\n\n2:14:15.740 --> 2:14:20.060\n Maybe like there's all kinds of things\n\n2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:24.180\n that we're going to, I feel like we're going to figure out.\n\n2:14:24.180 --> 2:14:26.860\n One of the things I think we're going to figure out,\n\n2:14:26.860 --> 2:14:29.180\n everything I've learned about my body,\n\n2:14:30.660 --> 2:14:34.600\n is that aside from it being adaptable,\n\n2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:37.260\n there's a lot of very unique parameters\n\n2:14:37.260 --> 2:14:39.740\n that are opaque to me that I'm measuring\n\n2:14:39.740 --> 2:14:41.140\n through this feedback mechanism\n\n2:14:41.140 --> 2:14:43.460\n by trying stuff and learning about it.\n\n2:14:43.460 --> 2:14:46.580\n And one of the things we might learn\n\n2:14:46.580 --> 2:14:50.440\n is that medicine cannot be done without collecting\n\n2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:53.360\n a huge amount of data about each individual human.\n\n2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:58.360\n So it's absurd to be, like if I show up and see a doctor,\n\n2:14:59.540 --> 2:15:00.660\n it's absurd for that doctor\n\n2:15:00.660 --> 2:15:03.100\n to have just a couple of minutes with me.\n\n2:15:03.100 --> 2:15:07.500\n Like just looking at basic symptoms,\n\n2:15:07.500 --> 2:15:12.500\n looking at such crappy data.\n\n2:15:12.500 --> 2:15:17.500\n Like first of all, no long term data,\n\n2:15:17.620 --> 2:15:20.980\n no longitudinal data, no historical data,\n\n2:15:20.980 --> 2:15:25.460\n no detailed analysis of all the possible things.\n\n2:15:25.460 --> 2:15:27.500\n Not just the related to your symptoms,\n\n2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:30.980\n but related to other things that you're not complaining about.\n\n2:15:30.980 --> 2:15:33.140\n Just giving you a full picture of the data\n\n2:15:33.140 --> 2:15:37.300\n and then using AI to help the human doctor\n\n2:15:37.300 --> 2:15:39.900\n highlight the things that you should perhaps\n\n2:15:39.900 --> 2:15:41.540\n pay extra attention to.\n\n2:15:41.540 --> 2:15:44.380\n I think we'll look back at this time as ridiculous\n\n2:15:44.380 --> 2:15:47.460\n that doctors were expected to help anybody whatsoever\n\n2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:49.100\n without having the data,\n\n2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:52.380\n without having a huge amount of data about the human body.\n\n2:15:52.380 --> 2:15:55.580\n Like you have to do so much with so little data.\n\n2:15:55.580 --> 2:15:57.300\n It's very 19th century.\n\n2:15:57.300 --> 2:15:58.580\n It's very 19th century.\n\n2:15:58.580 --> 2:16:00.900\n So it relies on the brilliance of doctors\n\n2:16:00.900 --> 2:16:02.980\n and of course the intuition,\n\n2:16:02.980 --> 2:16:05.100\n the instinct you build up over time.\n\n2:16:05.100 --> 2:16:06.660\n And that's quite powerful.\n\n2:16:06.660 --> 2:16:09.500\n The human brain is pretty damn good\n\n2:16:09.500 --> 2:16:11.140\n for using experience to teach you\n\n2:16:11.140 --> 2:16:12.180\n how to make a good decision.\n\n2:16:12.180 --> 2:16:16.740\n But still it's, you might as well be bloodletting.\n\n2:16:16.740 --> 2:16:21.460\n Like it's humbling to think about that.\n\n2:16:21.460 --> 2:16:22.420\n It's humbling.\n\n2:16:22.420 --> 2:16:24.060\n It is humbling and it's important.\n\n2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:28.900\n I think doctors sometimes lose that humble perspective\n\n2:16:28.900 --> 2:16:30.020\n on what they do.\n\n2:16:30.020 --> 2:16:31.860\n And I think it's very important\n\n2:16:31.860 --> 2:16:34.060\n because as I said, medical history is just,\n\n2:16:34.060 --> 2:16:36.620\n medical dogma has been tossed into the trash bin\n\n2:16:36.620 --> 2:16:37.900\n so many times.\n\n2:16:37.900 --> 2:16:40.860\n Something doctors were sure of was the case is not.\n\n2:16:40.860 --> 2:16:44.380\n And it's important to be cognizant of that.\n\n2:16:46.660 --> 2:16:51.660\n You tweeted about somebody that had a big impact\n\n2:16:52.220 --> 2:16:55.260\n just by reading about him on my life as well.\n\n2:16:56.140 --> 2:16:57.340\n Still think about him.\n\n2:16:58.180 --> 2:17:00.420\n Rest in peace, Dr. Paul Farmer.\n\n2:17:00.420 --> 2:17:01.860\n A big inspiration to me.\n\n2:17:01.860 --> 2:17:04.100\n His medical career was a testament\n\n2:17:04.100 --> 2:17:07.300\n to what one person can do to improve the world.\n\n2:17:07.300 --> 2:17:09.500\n So who was Paul Farmer?\n\n2:17:09.500 --> 2:17:12.140\n And what made him a great doctor and a great man\n\n2:17:12.140 --> 2:17:15.540\n and somebody who was an inspiration to you?\n\n2:17:15.540 --> 2:17:19.740\n So Paul Farmer was a kind of pioneer of global health.\n\n2:17:19.740 --> 2:17:23.020\n He started Partners in Health,\n\n2:17:23.020 --> 2:17:25.660\n which is kind of an international health organization\n\n2:17:25.660 --> 2:17:28.140\n that operates originally in Haiti,\n\n2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:30.580\n also Rwanda and elsewhere.\n\n2:17:30.580 --> 2:17:34.260\n And I think he was just so a zealot\n\n2:17:34.260 --> 2:17:37.820\n for getting healthcare to some of the poorest people\n\n2:17:37.820 --> 2:17:38.780\n in the world.\n\n2:17:38.780 --> 2:17:41.260\n And I remember reading some of his books\n\n2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:43.020\n and a book about him by Tracy Kidder\n\n2:17:43.020 --> 2:17:45.820\n that's really great, Mountains Beyond Mountains,\n\n2:17:45.820 --> 2:17:47.780\n about how even when he was a medical student,\n\n2:17:47.780 --> 2:17:50.660\n he was flying back and forth to Haiti in between exams\n\n2:17:50.660 --> 2:17:55.620\n and just with this really intense focus and interest\n\n2:17:55.620 --> 2:17:58.500\n in getting healthcare to where it's not.\n\n2:17:58.500 --> 2:18:00.500\n And I think traveling around the world,\n\n2:18:00.500 --> 2:18:05.220\n especially to poor places like India, Calcutta, Nepal,\n\n2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:07.900\n you really see how unevenly the benefits\n\n2:18:07.900 --> 2:18:09.220\n of modern medicine are spread\n\n2:18:09.220 --> 2:18:10.220\n over the surface of the earth.\n\n2:18:10.220 --> 2:18:11.220\n Not only if you're,\n\n2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:13.540\n cause if you're in Antarctica and have a heart attack,\n\n2:18:13.540 --> 2:18:14.940\n you're in serious trouble,\n\n2:18:14.940 --> 2:18:18.940\n but just medications that cost pennies a day\n\n2:18:19.820 --> 2:18:21.420\n can help people.\n\n2:18:21.420 --> 2:18:25.340\n A lot of children in India under five die of diarrhea\n\n2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:27.660\n and all they need is oral rehydration solutions\n\n2:18:27.660 --> 2:18:30.100\n to stay hydrated.\n\n2:18:30.100 --> 2:18:32.460\n Most of them can't afford IV fluids, for instance,\n\n2:18:32.460 --> 2:18:33.540\n to get admitted to the hospital.\n\n2:18:33.540 --> 2:18:37.100\n And really dehydration just kills hundreds of thousands\n\n2:18:37.100 --> 2:18:38.860\n of kids throughout the world.\n\n2:18:38.860 --> 2:18:42.900\n Not to mention bacterial pneumonia also is a major cause\n\n2:18:42.900 --> 2:18:44.660\n of death in children under five.\n\n2:18:44.660 --> 2:18:48.060\n And many of them, not all, would be saved by amoxicillin,\n\n2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:49.260\n which is just pennies.\n\n2:18:50.340 --> 2:18:54.180\n And I, for me, I took a, had a path\n\n2:18:54.180 --> 2:18:56.420\n and I wanted to have a career in global health.\n\n2:18:56.420 --> 2:18:59.060\n And I started traveling abroad to India and elsewhere\n\n2:18:59.060 --> 2:19:01.780\n when I was a medical student and continued doing that.\n\n2:19:01.780 --> 2:19:03.540\n Paul Farmer was sort of one of the first\n\n2:19:03.540 --> 2:19:05.820\n to kind of open everyone's eyes, I think,\n\n2:19:05.820 --> 2:19:09.540\n about the good you can do with just money\n\n2:19:09.540 --> 2:19:12.340\n that we would, you know, change that we would throw away,\n\n2:19:12.340 --> 2:19:14.100\n just, you know, put in a person, forget it,\n\n2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:16.820\n or wherever we accumulate change these days.\n\n2:19:16.820 --> 2:19:18.700\n So that's very eye opening.\n\n2:19:18.700 --> 2:19:21.660\n And while medical science advances and that's good,\n\n2:19:21.660 --> 2:19:23.020\n you know, we shouldn't forget\n\n2:19:23.020 --> 2:19:25.140\n that 100 year old treatments could save lives\n\n2:19:25.140 --> 2:19:27.540\n in parts of the world where they're just not available.\n\n2:19:27.540 --> 2:19:30.940\n People should definitely read Mountains Beyond Mountains.\n\n2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:35.700\n Just, for me at least, sort of a person from outside\n\n2:19:35.700 --> 2:19:39.860\n all of it, it was the first person to make me realize\n\n2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:43.660\n how difficult and the amount of humanity\n\n2:19:43.660 --> 2:19:45.420\n that's involved in being a doctor.\n\n2:19:46.380 --> 2:19:50.180\n So it's not some kind of cold economics based argument\n\n2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:52.780\n about where to send treatments and so on.\n\n2:19:52.780 --> 2:19:55.860\n That is there too, like you said,\n\n2:19:55.860 --> 2:19:59.300\n basic treatments can help hundreds of thousands,\n\n2:19:59.300 --> 2:20:02.060\n millions of people in many parts of the world.\n\n2:20:02.060 --> 2:20:07.060\n But it's also when you have a patient in front of you,\n\n2:20:08.700 --> 2:20:11.500\n there's some aspect of you that's willing to give\n\n2:20:11.500 --> 2:20:13.420\n a lot of your time, a lot of your money,\n\n2:20:13.420 --> 2:20:16.900\n a lot of your effort to saving them,\n\n2:20:16.900 --> 2:20:18.940\n even though it doesn't make any sense.\n\n2:20:20.300 --> 2:20:23.820\n It's irrational in some sense, but it's also human.\n\n2:20:23.820 --> 2:20:25.500\n And that's the struggle of every doctor.\n\n2:20:25.500 --> 2:20:27.940\n Like when you have to choose how to allocate your time,\n\n2:20:27.940 --> 2:20:30.620\n how to allocate your mental energy.\n\n2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:34.180\n It's a tough choice that a doctor has to make\n\n2:20:34.180 --> 2:20:35.340\n and it's a human choice.\n\n2:20:35.340 --> 2:20:39.660\n It's not some kind of cold game theoretic choice.\n\n2:20:39.660 --> 2:20:42.820\n It's also a human choice and it can be irrational\n\n2:20:42.820 --> 2:20:44.300\n in some sense.\n\n2:20:44.300 --> 2:20:45.900\n People are asking you for help.\n\n2:20:45.900 --> 2:20:48.340\n That's basically what every patient interaction is.\n\n2:20:48.340 --> 2:20:49.620\n Someone's asking you for help.\n\n2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:52.140\n So your inclination is to help them.\n\n2:20:52.140 --> 2:20:54.340\n And even if it means going above and beyond,\n\n2:20:54.340 --> 2:20:57.780\n I mean, a lot of factors affect how compassionate\n\n2:20:57.780 --> 2:21:02.660\n a doctor might be on any given day or point in their career,\n\n2:21:02.660 --> 2:21:05.260\n their own stress and burnout, et cetera.\n\n2:21:05.260 --> 2:21:06.740\n But it's someone asking you for help\n\n2:21:06.740 --> 2:21:08.820\n and so you do what you can to help them.\n\n2:21:11.380 --> 2:21:15.500\n You've done quite a lot of things in your life.\n\n2:21:15.500 --> 2:21:18.100\n It's been an interesting journey.\n\n2:21:18.100 --> 2:21:21.140\n Of course, there's a lot of story yet to be written.\n\n2:21:21.140 --> 2:21:24.260\n But what advice would you give to young people today?\n\n2:21:24.260 --> 2:21:28.260\n In high school, maybe undergrad, college,\n\n2:21:28.260 --> 2:21:30.500\n starting out on that journey.\n\n2:21:30.500 --> 2:21:34.900\n Maybe trying to pick majors, trying to pick jobs,\n\n2:21:34.900 --> 2:21:38.620\n careers, dreams and goals they can pursue.\n\n2:21:38.620 --> 2:21:40.820\n What advice would you give them to have a career\n\n2:21:40.820 --> 2:21:43.420\n they can be proud of or to even have a life\n\n2:21:43.420 --> 2:21:44.420\n they can be proud of?\n\n2:21:45.500 --> 2:21:48.180\n Well, I think having passion,\n\n2:21:48.180 --> 2:21:50.300\n which isn't always a voluntary thing.\n\n2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:52.140\n You just have it or you don't perhaps.\n\n2:21:52.140 --> 2:21:54.500\n But becoming passionate about something\n\n2:21:54.500 --> 2:21:57.660\n and following it wherever it takes you,\n\n2:21:57.660 --> 2:21:59.660\n I think is really important.\n\n2:21:59.660 --> 2:22:01.820\n You know, when I finished college\n\n2:22:01.820 --> 2:22:03.900\n and sort of went to Russia for the first time,\n\n2:22:03.900 --> 2:22:06.740\n that was in some ways the beginning of my whole career\n\n2:22:06.740 --> 2:22:09.140\n and passions in my life.\n\n2:22:09.140 --> 2:22:11.700\n And I didn't know what I was going for,\n\n2:22:11.700 --> 2:22:12.580\n what was gonna happen,\n\n2:22:12.580 --> 2:22:14.140\n what kind of career it would turn into,\n\n2:22:14.140 --> 2:22:16.020\n what kind of job would it help me get when I got back.\n\n2:22:16.020 --> 2:22:17.740\n I wasn't thinking about any of that.\n\n2:22:17.740 --> 2:22:20.460\n I mean, I'm very fortunate I got that opportunity.\n\n2:22:20.460 --> 2:22:24.660\n I'm very fortunate to be able to go and see those places\n\n2:22:24.660 --> 2:22:25.740\n and have my mind opened.\n\n2:22:25.740 --> 2:22:29.380\n And I think that really just the fuel from that passion\n\n2:22:29.380 --> 2:22:30.540\n that was created during that time\n\n2:22:30.540 --> 2:22:32.740\n is still 20 years later going strong.\n\n2:22:33.820 --> 2:22:35.020\n I'm partial to healthcare.\n\n2:22:35.020 --> 2:22:36.660\n I love being a doctor.\n\n2:22:36.660 --> 2:22:39.460\n I think it's the perfect combination\n\n2:22:39.460 --> 2:22:41.660\n of kind of intellectual problem solving,\n\n2:22:41.660 --> 2:22:44.660\n being a detective while also working with your hands.\n\n2:22:44.660 --> 2:22:46.220\n You know, when you do procedures,\n\n2:22:46.220 --> 2:22:49.220\n especially in the ER, it's sort of the perfect combination.\n\n2:22:49.220 --> 2:22:51.700\n I'm not a surgeon, but I do use my hands quite a bit\n\n2:22:54.100 --> 2:22:55.380\n for a variety of reasons.\n\n2:22:55.380 --> 2:22:57.900\n And so I always loved working with my hands.\n\n2:22:57.900 --> 2:23:00.780\n I loved crafts, especially prehistoric crafts\n\n2:23:01.940 --> 2:23:03.420\n before medical school.\n\n2:23:03.420 --> 2:23:06.060\n And I just love kind of problem solving,\n\n2:23:06.060 --> 2:23:08.860\n getting clues, figuring out what's going on,\n\n2:23:08.860 --> 2:23:12.340\n following your nose, using your instincts, your knowledge,\n\n2:23:12.340 --> 2:23:15.020\n and also just keen observation of the patient.\n\n2:23:15.020 --> 2:23:17.700\n After seeing patient after patient, hundreds of patients,\n\n2:23:17.700 --> 2:23:20.780\n maybe thousands over years, you do get this sort of\n\n2:23:20.780 --> 2:23:22.900\n innate kind of sense, this gestalt\n\n2:23:22.900 --> 2:23:24.260\n about what might be going on.\n\n2:23:24.260 --> 2:23:26.100\n And, you know, it's not always a numbers thing.\n\n2:23:26.100 --> 2:23:26.940\n That's the thing.\n\n2:23:26.940 --> 2:23:30.620\n There's always, gestalt is actually a big part of medicine.\n\n2:23:30.620 --> 2:23:33.300\n You know, you often in ERs or in hospitals,\n\n2:23:33.300 --> 2:23:35.860\n hear a nurse or a doctor say something like,\n\n2:23:35.860 --> 2:23:37.940\n this patient just doesn't look good.\n\n2:23:37.940 --> 2:23:40.820\n And it's sort of, you can't point to a number, a value,\n\n2:23:40.820 --> 2:23:43.660\n a level in their blood, you know, a test,\n\n2:23:43.660 --> 2:23:45.100\n but something about them.\n\n2:23:45.100 --> 2:23:47.420\n And a lot of that I think has to do\n\n2:23:47.420 --> 2:23:49.860\n with the color of their skin, believe it or not,\n\n2:23:49.860 --> 2:23:52.980\n which can change in certain disease states.\n\n2:23:52.980 --> 2:23:56.220\n But I think that it's just,\n\n2:23:56.220 --> 2:23:59.700\n medicine combines this observation, the skills,\n\n2:23:59.700 --> 2:24:02.980\n the knowledge, it's art and science, it's human,\n\n2:24:02.980 --> 2:24:06.900\n and it's robotic, you know, algorithmic at the same time.\n\n2:24:06.900 --> 2:24:10.020\n And I think it just, yeah, combines kind of\n\n2:24:10.020 --> 2:24:11.700\n all my passions all in one.\n\n2:24:11.700 --> 2:24:14.060\n And I would, you know, if anyone's going into healthcare,\n\n2:24:14.060 --> 2:24:16.380\n I'd strongly encourage them to do so, but I'm very biased.\n\n2:24:16.380 --> 2:24:19.620\n So with that early passion, whatever that little flame was\n\n2:24:19.620 --> 2:24:24.620\n that brought you to Russia, were you able to vocalize it\n\n2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:27.140\n or was it just something like a gut\n\n2:24:27.140 --> 2:24:30.740\n that's pulled you towards some exploration\n\n2:24:30.740 --> 2:24:33.020\n of the unknown or something like this?\n\n2:24:33.020 --> 2:24:34.860\n I think it was a combination of things.\n\n2:24:34.860 --> 2:24:36.920\n One was just going to a different place\n\n2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:39.920\n that was different from where I grew up, you know.\n\n2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:42.140\n The suburbs, you know, when you're in high school,\n\n2:24:42.140 --> 2:24:44.220\n you hate them, later on they don't seem so bad.\n\n2:24:44.220 --> 2:24:45.940\n But, you know, I just wanted to get,\n\n2:24:45.940 --> 2:24:48.220\n I mean, I'm very fortunate how I was raised\n\n2:24:48.220 --> 2:24:51.520\n and never wanted for anything that wasn't rich,\n\n2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:54.500\n but just to get out and see a different place,\n\n2:24:54.500 --> 2:24:56.540\n a different people with a different culture\n\n2:24:56.540 --> 2:24:58.540\n and history and language and literature\n\n2:24:58.540 --> 2:25:00.700\n and to see different climates and geographies\n\n2:25:00.700 --> 2:25:03.560\n and ecosystems, I just wanted to see something different.\n\n2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:07.360\n And that, I guess that's what I've sought after ever since.\n\n2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:09.580\n So just that was just so fascinating.\n\n2:25:09.580 --> 2:25:12.460\n Like my trip to Kamchatka in 2003,\n\n2:25:12.460 --> 2:25:14.100\n where I was there for four months\n\n2:25:14.100 --> 2:25:16.180\n and I didn't speak English for, I think,\n\n2:25:16.180 --> 2:25:17.700\n two months out of it.\n\n2:25:17.700 --> 2:25:20.380\n And just, I remember lying on the floor,\n\n2:25:20.380 --> 2:25:22.260\n some wooden floor in a hunter's cabin\n\n2:25:22.260 --> 2:25:23.700\n in the middle of Northern Kamchatka,\n\n2:25:23.700 --> 2:25:26.180\n just being like, what am I doing here?\n\n2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:28.780\n This is, I'm just so grateful for like the experiences\n\n2:25:28.780 --> 2:25:32.020\n I was having, what I was seeing and realizing and learning.\n\n2:25:32.020 --> 2:25:33.540\n It was just, I was so grateful,\n\n2:25:33.540 --> 2:25:35.460\n even though I was lying on this hard, uncomfortable floor,\n\n2:25:35.460 --> 2:25:37.600\n it's just like, this is so amazing.\n\n2:25:37.600 --> 2:25:40.500\n And that, I don't think I'll ever have another travel\n\n2:25:40.500 --> 2:25:41.980\n as meaningful and life changing\n\n2:25:41.980 --> 2:25:44.480\n as that particular trip to Kamchatka was.\n\n2:25:46.100 --> 2:25:47.620\n Though I'm still striving after it.\n\n2:25:47.620 --> 2:25:51.260\n You never replicate that first high, but you always try.\n\n2:25:51.260 --> 2:25:54.440\n So I just think that seeing something different\n\n2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:56.080\n is kind of the game.\n\n2:25:56.080 --> 2:25:57.940\n And there wasn't really a plan.\n\n2:25:57.940 --> 2:26:02.140\n Cause I got a chance to talk to the CEO of Qualcomm recently\n\n2:26:02.140 --> 2:26:07.140\n and his advice is, always have a plan.\n\n2:26:07.140 --> 2:26:12.140\n And it sounds like you're saying don't have a plan.\n\n2:26:13.900 --> 2:26:16.100\n Don't need to have a plan.\n\n2:26:16.100 --> 2:26:19.580\n Just listen to your gut, your passion and follow that\n\n2:26:19.580 --> 2:26:21.380\n and see where that takes you.\n\n2:26:21.380 --> 2:26:23.260\n Cause it's telling you something.\n\n2:26:23.260 --> 2:26:26.820\n Yeah, I think, I guess the plan could be specific\n\n2:26:26.820 --> 2:26:29.580\n or it could be as general as I just wanna go far away\n\n2:26:29.580 --> 2:26:32.260\n and see something very different, that's my plan.\n\n2:26:32.260 --> 2:26:33.620\n And I did just one line.\n\n2:26:33.620 --> 2:26:36.660\n Yeah, just followed my nose from one thing to the next,\n\n2:26:36.660 --> 2:26:38.620\n just being interested, following my passion.\n\n2:26:38.620 --> 2:26:41.500\n And again, very fortunate I could do that.\n\n2:26:41.500 --> 2:26:45.820\n Are there places in the world you're kind of thinking\n\n2:26:45.820 --> 2:26:49.620\n about that your life might take you at some point\n\n2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:55.040\n to be a doctor there for a time,\n\n2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:58.580\n to explore for a time that you haven't yet?\n\n2:26:58.580 --> 2:27:01.620\n I have some colleagues who do kind of global health work\n\n2:27:01.620 --> 2:27:05.740\n in various countries in Africa and Central and South America.\n\n2:27:05.740 --> 2:27:09.940\n I would really love to go to some of those places,\n\n2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:11.220\n not just for a short trip,\n\n2:27:11.220 --> 2:27:13.620\n but hopefully for an extended period of time\n\n2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:17.540\n with sort of the healthcare being the ticket in,\n\n2:27:17.540 --> 2:27:20.580\n but then maybe even bringing my children or just,\n\n2:27:20.580 --> 2:27:23.520\n I guess at this point, some of the travel I dream about\n\n2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:25.080\n is sort of replicating what I did\n\n2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:26.820\n and showing it to my kids in a way.\n\n2:27:27.820 --> 2:27:29.540\n But there's still a lot I haven't seen\n\n2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:30.980\n and would love to see as well.\n\n2:27:30.980 --> 2:27:35.820\n But I think those opportunities sort of lend themselves well\n\n2:27:35.820 --> 2:27:37.980\n as a doctor with kind of the ability to go there\n\n2:27:37.980 --> 2:27:39.780\n and sort of help patients,\n\n2:27:39.780 --> 2:27:42.580\n but also teach medical students and residents.\n\n2:27:42.580 --> 2:27:45.460\n Teaching is actually a huge part of being a doctor\n\n2:27:45.460 --> 2:27:47.080\n that's underappreciated,\n\n2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:48.860\n but that's actually part of the fun of being a doctor\n\n2:27:48.860 --> 2:27:50.100\n is that you're also a teacher.\n\n2:27:50.100 --> 2:27:52.100\n Of course, the word doctor means teacher,\n\n2:27:52.100 --> 2:27:54.400\n but it's come to mean something else.\n\n2:27:55.260 --> 2:27:57.900\n But in some of my jobs,\n\n2:27:57.900 --> 2:28:00.660\n I'm working alongside medical students and residents\n\n2:28:00.660 --> 2:28:03.020\n and I'm giving them my knowledge, my wisdom,\n\n2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:04.300\n sharing with them stories.\n\n2:28:04.300 --> 2:28:06.860\n And so that's a very satisfying part of the job.\n\n2:28:08.620 --> 2:28:10.860\n If we could take a brief step\n\n2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:15.300\n into a dark place together for a time,\n\n2:28:15.300 --> 2:28:20.300\n is there, what is a dark place you've gone in your mind\n\n2:28:21.460 --> 2:28:22.540\n in your life?\n\n2:28:22.540 --> 2:28:26.580\n What would be the darkest place you ever gone\n\n2:28:26.580 --> 2:28:30.140\n for a time, for a moment?\n\n2:28:32.580 --> 2:28:34.260\n And how did you survive?\n\n2:28:34.260 --> 2:28:35.460\n How did you overcome it?\n\n2:28:36.900 --> 2:28:39.340\n That's a very good question.\n\n2:28:39.340 --> 2:28:44.340\n I would say I haven't had as dark moments\n\n2:28:45.460 --> 2:28:49.580\n as many of the people who I care for in the emergency room.\n\n2:28:49.580 --> 2:28:51.180\n I'm fortunate in that way.\n\n2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:56.140\n I've had a pretty enjoyable, satisfying life.\n\n2:28:56.140 --> 2:29:00.820\n I think everybody has dark moments though, including me.\n\n2:29:00.820 --> 2:29:03.740\n One of the most shocking things I feel like\n\n2:29:03.740 --> 2:29:07.100\n becoming an adult, my two big realizations have been,\n\n2:29:07.100 --> 2:29:08.680\n one, no one knows what they're doing.\n\n2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:12.260\n And two, suicide is incredibly common,\n\n2:29:12.260 --> 2:29:14.400\n like in all humans and all societies.\n\n2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:16.180\n That I just find shocking.\n\n2:29:16.180 --> 2:29:18.540\n I mean, I've never seriously contemplated myself,\n\n2:29:18.540 --> 2:29:20.940\n but I wouldn't say it hasn't crossed my mind\n\n2:29:20.940 --> 2:29:24.500\n during some more stressful times of life.\n\n2:29:24.500 --> 2:29:27.580\n I think it crosses everyone's mind.\n\n2:29:27.580 --> 2:29:31.100\n And sort of as a kid, I found that I never would have guessed\n\n2:29:31.100 --> 2:29:32.860\n how common suicide is.\n\n2:29:32.860 --> 2:29:37.700\n It's an important question to sort of the Camus question,\n\n2:29:37.700 --> 2:29:39.120\n like why live?\n\n2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:41.720\n Why?\n\n2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:42.820\n Why?\n\n2:29:42.820 --> 2:29:46.180\n Because like life, especially when you're struggling,\n\n2:29:46.180 --> 2:29:47.920\n especially when life is shit,\n\n2:29:48.820 --> 2:29:51.340\n like why am I doing any of this?\n\n2:29:51.340 --> 2:29:54.360\n And then on top of that, chemistry of your brain,\n\n2:29:55.420 --> 2:29:58.580\n it could be as simple as diet and nutrition\n\n2:29:58.580 --> 2:30:02.460\n and aforementioned exercise and things like this\n\n2:30:02.460 --> 2:30:05.940\n that affect the chemistry such that you're more predisposed\n\n2:30:05.940 --> 2:30:09.980\n to go to the places of asking the question why,\n\n2:30:09.980 --> 2:30:14.560\n and maybe struggling to find a good answer.\n\n2:30:14.560 --> 2:30:17.980\n Because it's actually a question with no good answer,\n\n2:30:17.980 --> 2:30:21.460\n except something in your chemistry says,\n\n2:30:21.460 --> 2:30:23.420\n well, I kind of like it.\n\n2:30:23.420 --> 2:30:26.140\n But there's no good intellectual answer.\n\n2:30:26.140 --> 2:30:29.000\n And especially if day to day, it's pain.\n\n2:30:29.920 --> 2:30:33.580\n You get to see these stories of Robin Williams,\n\n2:30:34.540 --> 2:30:36.440\n these people that are on top of the world\n\n2:30:36.440 --> 2:30:38.100\n from an external perspective,\n\n2:30:38.100 --> 2:30:42.880\n but from an internal perspective, it's struggle.\n\n2:30:42.880 --> 2:30:46.180\n Every day is pain, feels hopeless,\n\n2:30:46.180 --> 2:30:51.180\n and yeah, that's a question we all have to struggle with\n\n2:30:51.700 --> 2:30:53.500\n or learn how to ignore.\n\n2:30:53.500 --> 2:30:55.620\n Maybe because if you ask the question too much,\n\n2:30:55.620 --> 2:30:59.180\n you're not going to find a good answer.\n\n2:30:59.180 --> 2:31:00.380\n That's a choice you make.\n\n2:31:00.380 --> 2:31:03.080\n I personally think you should ask that question a lot.\n\n2:31:05.780 --> 2:31:08.940\n But maybe because I have the luxury of the chemistry I have\n\n2:31:08.940 --> 2:31:13.940\n where I'm not in danger of seriously contemplating suicide.\n\n2:31:13.940 --> 2:31:18.060\n But why live is an important question to answer constantly\n\n2:31:18.060 --> 2:31:19.960\n and struggle to answer that constantly.\n\n2:31:21.700 --> 2:31:25.940\n But people, I've been extremely fortunate\n\n2:31:25.940 --> 2:31:29.500\n to meet people over the past couple of years\n\n2:31:29.500 --> 2:31:30.800\n that are really struggling.\n\n2:31:31.740 --> 2:31:36.740\n And you have probably met people\n\n2:31:39.220 --> 2:31:42.380\n who are really struggling, like orders of magnitude\n\n2:31:42.380 --> 2:31:45.220\n more people who are really struggling.\n\n2:31:45.220 --> 2:31:48.580\n Some of it is psychological, a lot of it is biological.\n\n2:31:49.460 --> 2:31:53.100\n And man, life is a motherfucker.\n\n2:31:53.100 --> 2:31:54.060\n It's pretty tough.\n\n2:31:54.060 --> 2:31:55.620\n Very true.\n\n2:31:55.620 --> 2:31:59.280\n I do think also past trauma plays a big role there\n\n2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:03.420\n like we talked about, war wounds and PTSD.\n\n2:32:03.420 --> 2:32:06.940\n A lot of people grew up with just horrific childhoods.\n\n2:32:06.940 --> 2:32:09.060\n They were abused in one way or another.\n\n2:32:09.060 --> 2:32:12.740\n And I think a lot of people who have not,\n\n2:32:12.740 --> 2:32:14.860\n I'm not saying a majority, but a lot of people,\n\n2:32:14.860 --> 2:32:17.860\n for instance, who I see in the ER coming in\n\n2:32:17.860 --> 2:32:20.780\n for threatening suicide or actually trying and failing\n\n2:32:20.780 --> 2:32:22.220\n and being brought to the ER,\n\n2:32:22.220 --> 2:32:26.540\n a lot of them just have really traumatic experiences,\n\n2:32:26.540 --> 2:32:30.060\n saw their parent commit suicide, were abused.\n\n2:32:30.060 --> 2:32:32.860\n These leave scars in the human brain and mind.\n\n2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:35.940\n And a lot of their subsequent lives\n\n2:32:35.940 --> 2:32:38.580\n of whether it's substance abuse, alcoholism, et cetera,\n\n2:32:38.580 --> 2:32:40.700\n is almost trying to escape from their own memories.\n\n2:32:40.700 --> 2:32:45.460\n And it's sort of such this overwhelming battle sometimes.\n\n2:32:45.460 --> 2:32:48.780\n Like sometimes people get ruined, it seems,\n\n2:32:48.780 --> 2:32:51.300\n and just can't be fixed, you know what I mean?\n\n2:32:51.300 --> 2:32:54.620\n Yes, you can improve diet and health and your life choices\n\n2:32:54.620 --> 2:32:57.540\n and seek out your passion and exercise.\n\n2:32:57.540 --> 2:32:59.140\n And those definitely will help.\n\n2:32:59.140 --> 2:33:00.820\n But sometimes just like, you know,\n\n2:33:00.820 --> 2:33:02.180\n you bear the scars of the past\n\n2:33:02.180 --> 2:33:04.260\n and there's no getting rid of them.\n\n2:33:04.260 --> 2:33:08.860\n Yeah, I think it's possible to live with them.\n\n2:33:08.860 --> 2:33:10.020\n I think so too. To the struggle.\n\n2:33:10.020 --> 2:33:12.220\n I would never say give up, you know.\n\n2:33:12.220 --> 2:33:13.740\n Keep fighting.\n\n2:33:13.740 --> 2:33:15.740\n It is a constant, it can be a constant battle\n\n2:33:15.740 --> 2:33:16.660\n for some people.\n\n2:33:16.660 --> 2:33:20.340\n I know it can be, and I've talked to many of those folks,\n\n2:33:20.340 --> 2:33:24.580\n I know it can feel hopeless, but keep up the good fight.\n\n2:33:24.580 --> 2:33:26.260\n Hopelessness. Keep up the good fight.\n\n2:33:26.260 --> 2:33:29.540\n Hopelessness is kind of one of the big suicide risk factors\n\n2:33:29.540 --> 2:33:32.380\n that you sort of ask about as a doctor, you know,\n\n2:33:32.380 --> 2:33:37.220\n do you feel hopeless? And that sort of can be a harbinger.\n\n2:33:37.220 --> 2:33:39.700\n I have quite a few dark moments.\n\n2:33:39.700 --> 2:33:44.700\n So if you're listening and you're struggling,\n\n2:33:44.900 --> 2:33:47.500\n we're in this together, brother and sister,\n\n2:33:47.500 --> 2:33:48.740\n keep up the good fight.\n\n2:33:51.060 --> 2:33:52.820\n Life is a motherfucker, as you said.\n\n2:33:52.820 --> 2:33:55.060\n It's really harder.\n\n2:33:55.060 --> 2:33:57.940\n I think as a kid, you know, in a joy free childhood,\n\n2:33:57.940 --> 2:34:00.140\n you don't realize, like, obviously there's a ton\n\n2:34:00.140 --> 2:34:02.020\n you don't realize about life,\n\n2:34:02.020 --> 2:34:03.380\n but then when you get to be an adult,\n\n2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:07.140\n you realize just how complex and hard it is.\n\n2:34:07.140 --> 2:34:08.860\n Is it this hard for adult animals?\n\n2:34:08.860 --> 2:34:10.660\n I don't know. I don't think it is.\n\n2:34:13.060 --> 2:34:18.060\n So I haven't seen the honesty of biology before you.\n\n2:34:18.940 --> 2:34:21.580\n Do you think about your own death?\n\n2:34:22.700 --> 2:34:25.300\n Do you contemplate death?\n\n2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:26.860\n Are you afraid of your own death?\n\n2:34:26.860 --> 2:34:28.220\n How do you make sense of it?\n\n2:34:29.780 --> 2:34:31.700\n I've definitely thought about it,\n\n2:34:31.700 --> 2:34:34.340\n especially maybe while doing certain risky things,\n\n2:34:35.420 --> 2:34:37.940\n ice climbing and others where every time I looked down,\n\n2:34:37.940 --> 2:34:39.020\n I thought about my own death.\n\n2:34:39.020 --> 2:34:41.820\n But I think, you know,\n\n2:34:41.820 --> 2:34:45.220\n I think having kids changes the equation for sure,\n\n2:34:46.860 --> 2:34:48.620\n should change the equation perhaps.\n\n2:34:48.620 --> 2:34:50.660\n So I think a lot of,\n\n2:34:50.660 --> 2:34:53.300\n now when I think about what will happen when I die,\n\n2:34:53.300 --> 2:34:56.260\n you know, there's a lot of worrying about\n\n2:34:56.260 --> 2:34:58.340\n what will happen to the people I care for.\n\n2:34:58.340 --> 2:35:00.940\n You know, you think about things like insurance policy,\n\n2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:04.980\n life insurance and, you know, disability insurance,\n\n2:35:04.980 --> 2:35:07.260\n that's not related to death, but more just injuries.\n\n2:35:07.260 --> 2:35:09.900\n And that's part of the weight, I guess,\n\n2:35:09.900 --> 2:35:13.380\n that you feel as an adult,\n\n2:35:13.380 --> 2:35:16.540\n that I think grows rapidly when you have kids.\n\n2:35:16.540 --> 2:35:17.420\n Though not only, you know,\n\n2:35:17.420 --> 2:35:19.020\n there's other people you can care for,\n\n2:35:19.020 --> 2:35:20.860\n your own parents and loved ones.\n\n2:35:20.860 --> 2:35:23.740\n Like a lot of people depend on individuals.\n\n2:35:23.740 --> 2:35:25.380\n And so you think about what will happen\n\n2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:27.740\n to the other people when you die.\n\n2:35:27.740 --> 2:35:31.780\n But also, to push back, that weight\n\n2:35:31.780 --> 2:35:35.660\n might be something you've convinced yourself to think about.\n\n2:35:35.660 --> 2:35:37.660\n It's an important weight to think about.\n\n2:35:37.660 --> 2:35:42.660\n But you focus on that weight to escape the other weight,\n\n2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:47.300\n which is, at one point,\n\n2:35:48.460 --> 2:35:51.580\n this consciousness just comes to an end.\n\n2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:54.580\n And it's hard to make sense of that.\n\n2:35:54.580 --> 2:35:56.380\n We kind of delude ourselves in thinking,\n\n2:35:56.380 --> 2:35:58.100\n okay, it just, yeah, it ends.\n\n2:35:58.100 --> 2:35:59.900\n That's the natural way of things and so on.\n\n2:35:59.900 --> 2:36:01.220\n That makes sense, so we're good.\n\n2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:03.700\n Okay, that's the way of life.\n\n2:36:03.700 --> 2:36:07.580\n But I don't think it's cognitively easy\n\n2:36:07.580 --> 2:36:12.260\n to just realize how terrifying that is.\n\n2:36:12.260 --> 2:36:17.260\n We love life so much that the end of it,\n\n2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:23.500\n it just, it's something that makes no sense.\n\n2:36:24.780 --> 2:36:26.300\n And if you linger on that thought,\n\n2:36:26.300 --> 2:36:31.300\n I think it's a painful, I would say even terrifying thought.\n\n2:36:31.460 --> 2:36:34.300\n Not scared of like, in a way that's\n\n2:36:34.300 --> 2:36:36.660\n almost like philosophically terrifying.\n\n2:36:36.660 --> 2:36:39.540\n Like, it just reminds you, maybe humbles you\n\n2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:42.520\n that you don't know anything about anything.\n\n2:36:44.340 --> 2:36:47.020\n But one of the things we do as humans really well\n\n2:36:47.020 --> 2:36:50.620\n is we, especially with kids, you realize,\n\n2:36:50.620 --> 2:36:53.500\n okay, we start caring for others in the community,\n\n2:36:53.500 --> 2:36:56.260\n in the family, and so on, and that distracts us.\n\n2:36:56.260 --> 2:36:58.540\n So then we can at least focus on other people's problems\n\n2:36:58.540 --> 2:36:59.900\n and not deal with our own.\n\n2:37:02.860 --> 2:37:05.180\n When I was a medical student, I was particularly\n\n2:37:05.180 --> 2:37:07.700\n fascinated with kind of what actually happens\n\n2:37:07.700 --> 2:37:10.820\n as people die, like in the last minute, seconds of life.\n\n2:37:10.820 --> 2:37:12.220\n It's sort of surprising sometimes,\n\n2:37:12.220 --> 2:37:13.820\n like what actually kills people.\n\n2:37:13.820 --> 2:37:17.160\n You know, like you can get, let's say, a bad head injury\n\n2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:18.880\n and you know, what kills you.\n\n2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:22.260\n Sometimes it's just your consciousness decreases\n\n2:37:22.260 --> 2:37:26.900\n and you become kind of comatose, you aspirate,\n\n2:37:26.900 --> 2:37:28.980\n your oxygen plummets, and you get cardiac arrest.\n\n2:37:28.980 --> 2:37:31.500\n You know, that kind of sequence of events.\n\n2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:34.700\n Or, you know, a heroin overdose,\n\n2:37:34.700 --> 2:37:36.080\n let's say you stop breathing.\n\n2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:37.620\n Similarly, your oxygen goes down,\n\n2:37:37.620 --> 2:37:38.580\n then you get a cardiac arrest.\n\n2:37:38.580 --> 2:37:41.380\n So I was really fascinated with what actually happens,\n\n2:37:41.380 --> 2:37:43.380\n what makes people die.\n\n2:37:43.380 --> 2:37:45.940\n And it was sort of a morbid fascination, obviously,\n\n2:37:45.940 --> 2:37:47.740\n like most of med school is.\n\n2:37:47.740 --> 2:37:52.280\n And I had many instances where I've had patients pass\n\n2:37:52.280 --> 2:37:55.600\n and as a medical student, I was sort of learning\n\n2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:57.540\n what's actually happening, watching it happen\n\n2:37:57.540 --> 2:37:59.980\n and not always being able to prevent it.\n\n2:37:59.980 --> 2:38:03.240\n It was sort of a scientific exploration.\n\n2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:06.220\n Then the patient's family comes in and are just devastated.\n\n2:38:06.220 --> 2:38:08.580\n And then it's like, rips you out\n\n2:38:08.580 --> 2:38:10.060\n of this scientific perspective\n\n2:38:10.060 --> 2:38:12.620\n and you just realize how horrible death is,\n\n2:38:12.620 --> 2:38:14.180\n but the person's fine.\n\n2:38:14.180 --> 2:38:15.540\n You know, it's the family, I guess.\n\n2:38:15.540 --> 2:38:18.780\n And that's why it's always, I guess that pointed out\n\n2:38:18.780 --> 2:38:20.740\n just how what people leave behind\n\n2:38:20.740 --> 2:38:22.940\n is often kind of the horribleness of death.\n\n2:38:22.940 --> 2:38:25.200\n Like just becoming unconscious and staying that way\n\n2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:28.140\n doesn't seem, I guess to me personally, so bad.\n\n2:38:28.140 --> 2:38:30.920\n Sort of like going to sleep, not waking up,\n\n2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:33.140\n not counting the pain and stuff that precedes it.\n\n2:38:33.140 --> 2:38:35.420\n So the actual pain, the actual suffering\n\n2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:39.300\n is often felt by the people who love the person who died.\n\n2:38:39.300 --> 2:38:43.980\n So both financial pain, psychological pain,\n\n2:38:43.980 --> 2:38:46.820\n for years missing them, all those kinds of things.\n\n2:38:46.820 --> 2:38:50.020\n Right, never forgetting the anniversary of their death.\n\n2:38:50.020 --> 2:38:54.180\n You know, just having flashbacks or something reminding you.\n\n2:38:54.180 --> 2:38:57.780\n That sort of brought home to me sort of what death means.\n\n2:38:57.780 --> 2:39:00.060\n And it was more about what people leave behind\n\n2:39:00.060 --> 2:39:01.900\n than what happens to them specifically.\n\n2:39:01.900 --> 2:39:04.260\n See, I like those concerns\n\n2:39:04.260 --> 2:39:07.900\n because I feel like I can do a lot about those.\n\n2:39:07.900 --> 2:39:09.180\n Those make sense to me.\n\n2:39:09.180 --> 2:39:12.020\n Then just be, if you're a father, just be a good father.\n\n2:39:12.020 --> 2:39:15.980\n If you're sort of, you mentioned sort of insurance.\n\n2:39:15.980 --> 2:39:18.380\n Yeah, there's like financial stuff to take care of.\n\n2:39:18.380 --> 2:39:19.900\n What I don't know what to do with\n\n2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:24.900\n is the philosophical existential crisis\n\n2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:28.980\n of the fact that this fricking thing ends.\n\n2:39:28.980 --> 2:39:32.500\n It doesn't, I don't know how to deal\n\n2:39:32.500 --> 2:39:35.560\n with the mystery that's beyond death.\n\n2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:36.620\n Why are we here?\n\n2:39:36.620 --> 2:39:38.020\n Why are we born at all?\n\n2:39:38.020 --> 2:39:39.540\n What is consciousness?\n\n2:39:39.540 --> 2:39:41.160\n And you just look at yourself.\n\n2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:42.000\n What is this?\n\n2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.100\n Why do I have the capacity to suffer?\n\n2:39:45.800 --> 2:39:47.940\n Why, why, all these kinds of why questions\n\n2:39:47.940 --> 2:39:49.140\n that don't have answers.\n\n2:39:49.140 --> 2:39:51.640\n Speaking of which, let me ask you a why question.\n\n2:39:52.540 --> 2:39:54.260\n The biggest ridiculous one.\n\n2:39:54.260 --> 2:39:56.520\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n2:39:58.220 --> 2:40:01.780\n Having, with this book, studied the incredible,\n\n2:40:01.780 --> 2:40:06.060\n beautiful biology of life, the components,\n\n2:40:06.060 --> 2:40:09.880\n the engineering components that make up this human body.\n\n2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:12.280\n But when you look at the entirety of it,\n\n2:40:13.100 --> 2:40:15.160\n what is why?\n\n2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:16.180\n Why are we here?\n\n2:40:16.180 --> 2:40:17.960\n Sometimes, probably more often than not,\n\n2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:20.280\n feel like the question of why is a trick\n\n2:40:20.280 --> 2:40:21.640\n of the human brain.\n\n2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:25.780\n And outside of our thoughts, there is no why.\n\n2:40:25.780 --> 2:40:28.060\n Why is not something that's in the universe.\n\n2:40:28.060 --> 2:40:30.460\n It's just this trick happening inside our brain.\n\n2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:36.260\n So why is a game that the human brain plays on itself?\n\n2:40:36.260 --> 2:40:40.980\n And then the reality of life doesn't have why's.\n\n2:40:40.980 --> 2:40:42.980\n I do wonder if asking why\n\n2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:44.940\n is sort of an evolutionary adaptation.\n\n2:40:44.940 --> 2:40:48.980\n Like why, you know, maybe hunting, gathering.\n\n2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:51.260\n Why does this plant grow there and not there?\n\n2:40:51.260 --> 2:40:53.220\n Why do I see the same deer tracks\n\n2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:55.540\n and by the same tree every three days?\n\n2:40:55.540 --> 2:40:58.060\n Why, you know, why is this, why is that?\n\n2:40:59.540 --> 2:41:03.460\n Why does this plant make me vomit and that plant doesn't?\n\n2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:06.100\n I guess those why's are very practical\n\n2:41:06.100 --> 2:41:08.260\n and oriented towards survival.\n\n2:41:08.260 --> 2:41:11.540\n But then obviously, you know, we not only use why,\n\n2:41:11.540 --> 2:41:13.780\n you know, we use it to maybe hunt better,\n\n2:41:13.780 --> 2:41:15.320\n gather better, survive better,\n\n2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:16.780\n but then we sort of extrapolate it\n\n2:41:16.780 --> 2:41:20.260\n into these unanswerable questions, you know,\n\n2:41:21.300 --> 2:41:23.900\n about why, like why does life exist?\n\n2:41:23.900 --> 2:41:26.920\n And it's possible that they're not unanswerable\n\n2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:30.100\n in the long arc of science and history.\n\n2:41:30.100 --> 2:41:33.320\n It's we're just striving for the really difficult questions.\n\n2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:36.340\n Right now, we just don't know much about anything\n\n2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:37.840\n and so we're striving.\n\n2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:41.300\n But there's a long, so most of human history,\n\n2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:43.340\n you were asking why questions\n\n2:41:43.340 --> 2:41:47.140\n for which we now have very precise answers,\n\n2:41:47.140 --> 2:41:48.980\n including with biology and physics\n\n2:41:48.980 --> 2:41:50.780\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:41:50.780 --> 2:41:54.040\n And maybe the why's, this cutting edge of science,\n\n2:41:54.040 --> 2:41:56.840\n of the explorer of the curiosity of the human mind.\n\n2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:00.060\n Like man's search for meaning\n\n2:42:00.060 --> 2:42:04.220\n is the sort of the ultimate driver of the why.\n\n2:42:04.220 --> 2:42:07.920\n And it's almost like it could be an evolutionary adaptation\n\n2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:11.380\n of asking exceptionally hard why questions\n\n2:42:11.380 --> 2:42:13.640\n that will never get answered.\n\n2:42:15.040 --> 2:42:17.500\n Like, so you should always have,\n\n2:42:17.500 --> 2:42:20.540\n like it's like a queue, it's a stack of questions,\n\n2:42:20.540 --> 2:42:23.140\n why questions, and that thing should never come\n\n2:42:23.140 --> 2:42:26.260\n to the bottom, should always be striving.\n\n2:42:26.260 --> 2:42:28.520\n And that's useful for humans to come up\n\n2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.980\n with better and better ways of survival.\n\n2:42:30.980 --> 2:42:34.100\n And maybe from in a bigger perspective\n\n2:42:34.100 --> 2:42:37.140\n for the universe to figure out something about itself.\n\n2:42:37.140 --> 2:42:39.820\n And it's just humans, just a useful tool for that.\n\n2:42:40.860 --> 2:42:42.900\n Or life on Earth is a useful tool for that.\n\n2:42:42.900 --> 2:42:45.940\n Well, John, this, you're,\n\n2:42:47.580 --> 2:42:50.160\n for people who should know, you're from Philadelphia.\n\n2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:52.900\n I'm from Philadelphia, so it's an honor\n\n2:42:52.900 --> 2:42:54.820\n that you would travel all this way\n\n2:42:54.820 --> 2:42:57.500\n from a place I love to the new place I love\n\n2:42:57.500 --> 2:43:00.420\n and that you'll write this really incredible book\n\n2:43:00.420 --> 2:43:04.140\n that celebrates the human body in the most honest of ways.\n\n2:43:04.140 --> 2:43:05.700\n And thank you for everything you do,\n\n2:43:05.700 --> 2:43:08.060\n for being a great educator, for being a great doctor,\n\n2:43:08.060 --> 2:43:10.140\n for being a great person, and for spending\n\n2:43:10.140 --> 2:43:11.980\n your really valuable time with me today.\n\n2:43:11.980 --> 2:43:12.820\n Thank you, John.\n\n2:43:12.820 --> 2:43:14.780\n Thanks for having me, Lex.\n\n2:43:14.780 --> 2:43:16.300\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:43:16.300 --> 2:43:17.700\n with Jonathan Reisman.\n\n2:43:17.700 --> 2:43:20.060\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n2:43:20.060 --> 2:43:21.540\n in the description.\n\n2:43:21.540 --> 2:43:24.820\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Paul Farmer,\n\n2:43:24.820 --> 2:43:27.800\n a doctor who has inspired both Jonathan and me\n\n2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:29.500\n with the way he practiced medicine\n\n2:43:29.500 --> 2:43:31.220\n and the way he lived his life.\n\n2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:35.520\n The idea that some lives matter less\n\n2:43:35.520 --> 2:43:38.880\n is the root of all that is wrong with the world.\n\n2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:53.880\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
