  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.360\n The following is a conversation with Yannis Papas, a comedian who cohosted the podcast\n\n00:05.360 --> 00:12.160\n History Hyenas that I came across when I was researching the Battle of Crete from WWII.\n\n00:12.160 --> 00:18.840\n He and his cohost were hilarious in their rants about history and about life.\n\n00:18.840 --> 00:23.840\n The chemistry they have is probably the best of any cohosted comedy podcast or even podcast\n\n00:23.840 --> 00:26.420\n in general that I've ever heard.\n\n00:26.420 --> 00:32.620\n As of a few weeks ago, unfortunately, History Hyenas is no more, at least for now, because\n\n00:32.620 --> 00:35.560\n all good things must come to an end.\n\n00:35.560 --> 00:41.720\n But Yannis hosts a new podcast called Long Days with Yannis Papas, plus he has a comedy\n\n00:41.720 --> 00:45.240\n special on YouTube for free.\n\n00:45.240 --> 00:51.040\n Quick mention of our sponsors, WineAxis, Blinkist, Magic Spoon, and Indeed.\n\n00:51.040 --> 00:54.760\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:54.760 --> 00:59.680\n As a side note, let me say that some of you have noticed that I have not spoken with too\n\n00:59.680 --> 01:03.920\n many computer scientists, physicists, biologists, or engineers recently.\n\n01:03.920 --> 01:08.520\n The reason has to do mostly with the risk aversion of many of these folks in the time\n\n01:08.520 --> 01:12.480\n of COVID, especially as they get closer to taking the vaccine.\n\n01:12.480 --> 01:17.340\n I'm tested several times a week and still some people are just more willing than others\n\n01:17.340 --> 01:20.960\n to have an in person conversation in these times.\n\n01:20.960 --> 01:26.080\n I only do these podcasts in person because I look for the possibility of a genuine human\n\n01:26.080 --> 01:27.080\n connection.\n\n01:27.080 --> 01:30.300\n I'm willing to sacrifice a lot for that.\n\n01:30.300 --> 01:35.260\n Maybe it's silly, but I look for the magic that Charles Bukowski writes about in his\n\n01:35.260 --> 01:36.800\n poem Nirvana.\n\n01:36.800 --> 01:42.160\n The magic that is somehow in the air on those rare occasions when two people meet, talk,\n\n01:42.160 --> 01:47.880\n and you notice that while on the surface you may be worlds apart, you're still somehow\n\n01:47.880 --> 01:50.800\n woven from the same fabric.\n\n01:50.800 --> 01:55.800\n I've had that with many guests, Jim Keller comes to mind, but many others as well.\n\n01:55.800 --> 02:01.280\n I'm an AI person, machine learning, robotics, computer science is my passion.\n\n02:01.280 --> 02:05.400\n Trust me, I can't wait to be having more technical conversations again, but I will\n\n02:05.400 --> 02:11.280\n also continue to mix in comedians, musicians, historians, and of course, wise all seeing\n\n02:11.280 --> 02:19.600\n sages like Giannis Papas and Tim Dillon, just to keep it, as Tim likes to say, fun.\n\n02:19.600 --> 02:26.200\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Giannis Papas.\n\n02:26.200 --> 02:32.400\n You've cohosted, until recently, an amazing history comedy podcast called The History\n\n02:32.400 --> 02:33.840\n Hyenas.\n\n02:33.840 --> 02:35.880\n So you're a bit of a student of history?\n\n02:35.880 --> 02:38.440\n Yeah, an F student of history.\n\n02:38.440 --> 02:39.440\n F student.\n\n02:39.440 --> 02:40.880\n Okay, I thought it was more like a D minus.\n\n02:40.880 --> 02:41.880\n D minus, yeah.\n\n02:41.880 --> 02:42.880\n Okay.\n\n02:42.880 --> 02:44.560\n Still got to repeat the grade if you get all D minuses.\n\n02:44.560 --> 02:49.140\n I actually had a.67 GPA average my freshman year and I had to do it again.\n\n02:49.140 --> 02:53.200\n This podcast is going to be the spectrum of human intelligence.\n\n02:53.200 --> 02:55.040\n It runs the gamut from there to here.\n\n02:55.040 --> 02:57.000\n So this is going to set the low bar.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:00.880\n I'm barely sliding into human, I'm closer to chimp.\n\n03:00.880 --> 03:08.560\n And I bring that up that you're also friends with the great, the powerful Tim Dillon.\n\n03:08.560 --> 03:14.680\n So let's talk about power and the corrupting effects of power.\n\n03:14.680 --> 03:16.880\n Sometimes I look at Tim Dillon as he grows in power.\n\n03:16.880 --> 03:19.520\n Oh, I thought you meant in size.\n\n03:19.520 --> 03:21.800\n Well, size, I think they're correlated.\n\n03:21.800 --> 03:22.800\n Yeah.\n\n03:22.800 --> 03:26.240\n I saw him, I've been in Austin a couple of days, I saw him once, we had eight meals in\n\n03:26.240 --> 03:27.240\n one day.\n\n03:27.240 --> 03:28.240\n Eight meals.\n\n03:28.240 --> 03:29.240\n Yeah.\n\n03:29.240 --> 03:32.360\n So I feel like I've been here longer than I have just because of the meals with Dillon.\n\n03:32.360 --> 03:34.360\n Kid likes biscuits and barbecue.\n\n03:34.360 --> 03:35.360\n Okay.\n\n03:35.360 --> 03:38.200\n So he's more like, see, I was imagining Putin or somebody like that.\n\n03:38.200 --> 03:39.880\n He's more like the North Korean dictator.\n\n03:39.880 --> 03:40.880\n Okay.\n\n03:40.880 --> 03:41.880\n Yeah.\n\n03:41.880 --> 03:42.880\n All right.\n\n03:42.880 --> 03:43.880\n They get along great, those two.\n\n03:43.880 --> 03:44.880\n Yeah.\n\n03:44.880 --> 03:48.540\n I mean, Tim Dillon and King Jong Un would be like, they could make like a buddy cop\n\n03:48.540 --> 03:49.540\n movie.\n\n03:49.540 --> 03:50.540\n They would get along like Lethal Weapon.\n\n03:50.540 --> 03:52.160\n That would be a good pitch movie.\n\n03:52.160 --> 03:53.160\n Great podcast.\n\n03:53.160 --> 03:54.160\n Yeah.\n\n03:54.160 --> 03:55.160\n That would be a great podcast.\n\n03:55.160 --> 03:56.160\n Yeah.\n\n03:56.160 --> 03:57.160\n So much to talk about.\n\n03:57.160 --> 03:59.360\n So many similar ideas about the world.\n\n03:59.360 --> 04:05.280\n So what do you think the world would look like if Tim Dillon was given absolute power?\n\n04:05.280 --> 04:10.960\n He seems like a person that's an interesting study of the corrupting effects of power.\n\n04:10.960 --> 04:11.960\n Yeah.\n\n04:11.960 --> 04:12.960\n You don't want to give him power.\n\n04:12.960 --> 04:15.560\n You don't want, I don't even want him wearing a suit.\n\n04:15.560 --> 04:19.500\n Like I want a guy who's as thoughtful and educated as you wearing a suit.\n\n04:19.500 --> 04:21.200\n Like cause you know, suits corrupt you.\n\n04:21.200 --> 04:22.960\n You put that suit on, you start feeling that power.\n\n04:22.960 --> 04:23.960\n You start.\n\n04:23.960 --> 04:24.960\n Definitely.\n\n04:24.960 --> 04:25.960\n It's like, you know, yeah.\n\n04:25.960 --> 04:26.960\n I don't even want Tim Dillon in a suit.\n\n04:26.960 --> 04:28.040\n Power would, he would kill people.\n\n04:28.040 --> 04:30.960\n He'd get rid of anything that he deemed.\n\n04:30.960 --> 04:34.200\n I mean, if you made a lobster roll and it wasn't up to Tim Dillon's standard, he would\n\n04:34.200 --> 04:35.200\n have you executed.\n\n04:35.200 --> 04:38.440\n The entire restaurant staff is just gone.\n\n04:38.440 --> 04:41.280\n He would have people below his food standard execute.\n\n04:41.280 --> 04:45.960\n There'd be programs, not of people who are political dissidents, but of people who don't\n\n04:45.960 --> 04:47.300\n meet his food standard.\n\n04:47.300 --> 04:50.480\n His cuisine standard is high and he's usually right.\n\n04:50.480 --> 04:52.480\n Do you think power does corrupt people?\n\n04:52.480 --> 04:53.480\n Yes.\n\n04:53.480 --> 04:56.720\n Like one of the reasons we mentioned offline Joe Rogan, he's been an inspiration to me\n\n04:56.720 --> 05:02.520\n cause he gets, he gets, if you get power, just more famous and famous and yes, probably\n\n05:02.520 --> 05:07.340\n a bit of power in terms of influence and he's still pretty much the same guy.\n\n05:07.340 --> 05:09.200\n I'm not sure that's going to be true for everybody.\n\n05:09.200 --> 05:11.480\n Do you ever think, ask yourself that question?\n\n05:11.480 --> 05:12.480\n Yeah.\n\n05:12.480 --> 05:13.480\n He's a rare breed.\n\n05:13.480 --> 05:15.440\n He's like a benign king.\n\n05:15.440 --> 05:19.200\n Most people I meet who are like really powerful are like douchebags and that's how they got\n\n05:19.200 --> 05:20.200\n there.\n\n05:20.200 --> 05:23.880\n I think that's, psychopaths have the advantage because they don't have feelings and Joe's\n\n05:23.880 --> 05:24.880\n a rare example.\n\n05:24.880 --> 05:29.720\n He's just a powerhouse of will and he, I do think about that.\n\n05:29.720 --> 05:30.720\n Yeah.\n\n05:30.720 --> 05:32.880\n I think I should be stopped right now.\n\n05:32.880 --> 05:37.240\n Just stop me right now because yeah, power for me, I would, when people get power, they\n\n05:37.240 --> 05:38.240\n indulge.\n\n05:38.240 --> 05:39.240\n It doesn't change anyone.\n\n05:39.240 --> 05:44.080\n It just reveals your darkest, you know, people aren't supposed to have anything they want.\n\n05:44.080 --> 05:45.540\n You got to be able to struggle for everything.\n\n05:45.540 --> 05:48.360\n So I would have a harem, I'd be like a Roman dictator.\n\n05:48.360 --> 05:49.360\n Yeah.\n\n05:49.360 --> 05:50.360\n I'd be like a Roman emperor.\n\n05:50.360 --> 05:51.360\n I mean, people called them emperors.\n\n05:51.360 --> 05:52.360\n They were dictators.\n\n05:52.360 --> 05:53.360\n The most effective leaders are dictators.\n\n05:53.360 --> 05:55.140\n I hope we get back to that.\n\n05:55.140 --> 05:56.140\n Democracy hasn't worked.\n\n05:56.140 --> 06:00.040\n I'm ready for a secession of Caesars and I want to start with AOC.\n\n06:00.040 --> 06:02.680\n That's true.\n\n06:02.680 --> 06:03.680\n Dictators get the job done.\n\n06:03.680 --> 06:04.680\n They do.\n\n06:04.680 --> 06:05.680\n They do.\n\n06:05.680 --> 06:07.280\n At a certain point you got, that's why social workers can only get you so far.\n\n06:07.280 --> 06:08.520\n You need action.\n\n06:08.520 --> 06:14.160\n I was a social worker for five years and all you do is ask about medications and you don't\n\n06:14.160 --> 06:15.160\n solve anything.\n\n06:15.160 --> 06:21.740\n I do ask myself of that, like, cause I'm more in the tech space of constructing systems\n\n06:21.740 --> 06:23.840\n that prevent me from being corrupt.\n\n06:23.840 --> 06:27.800\n Cause right now I'm all about love and all about those kinds of things.\n\n06:27.800 --> 06:31.980\n But I wonder, you said like, it just reveals the darkness.\n\n06:31.980 --> 06:35.500\n The problem is we might not be aware of our own darkness.\n\n06:35.500 --> 06:37.600\n I have the same feeling about money actually.\n\n06:37.600 --> 06:44.480\n I've been avoiding thinking about money, like basically constructing my moral system, my\n\n06:44.480 --> 06:46.080\n moral compass around money.\n\n06:46.080 --> 06:54.600\n It's like the moment I feel a little too happy about the idea of owning some cool shiny thing,\n\n06:54.600 --> 06:58.800\n I started to think, okay, I'm not going to own that shiny thing cause I'm afraid of the\n\n06:58.800 --> 07:00.160\n slippery slope of it.\n\n07:00.160 --> 07:01.160\n Yeah.\n\n07:01.160 --> 07:02.160\n You ever think about that kind of stuff?\n\n07:02.160 --> 07:03.160\n Yeah.\n\n07:03.160 --> 07:11.160\n The thing about the capitalist system is it puts sort of a profit motive above beauty.\n\n07:11.160 --> 07:15.840\n And you notice when you see certain cities, especially in the old days where like buildings\n\n07:15.840 --> 07:20.760\n used to be beautiful and now they're just like boxes, they throw a kid up and it's just\n\n07:20.760 --> 07:24.240\n for all profit margin.\n\n07:24.240 --> 07:27.880\n It's the illusion of permanence that, you know, it's like, oh, let me get as much money\n\n07:27.880 --> 07:28.880\n as I can.\n\n07:28.880 --> 07:29.880\n You're like, yeah.\n\n07:29.880 --> 07:32.720\n You know, my dad used to say, you know, everyone, it's a cliche, but you can't take it with\n\n07:32.720 --> 07:33.720\n you.\n\n07:33.720 --> 07:37.120\n So it's kind of, it's, it's comical to me that we're here trying to get this infinite\n\n07:37.120 --> 07:38.120\n amount.\n\n07:38.120 --> 07:41.600\n Like it's like Sisyphus, we're all trying to climb this hill, but I mean, the rock's\n\n07:41.600 --> 07:42.600\n going to fall on us.\n\n07:42.600 --> 07:44.000\n So I think that's a healthy outlook.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\n Yeah.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:48.160\n My dad always used to say before he passed, you know, he would say, you can't, you have\n\n07:48.160 --> 07:51.840\n to survive not only physically, but you have to survive emotionally.\n\n07:51.840 --> 07:56.120\n I think a lot of people forget about the emotional part of a survival.\n\n07:56.120 --> 08:01.800\n You have to survive emotionally and humor and, and, and understanding reality in its\n\n08:01.800 --> 08:04.080\n objective context helps with that.\n\n08:04.080 --> 08:11.480\n Accepting reality as this ephemeral thing that you're really just a part of, but not\n\n08:11.480 --> 08:15.120\n as significant as your ego wants you to believe is a, is a start.\n\n08:15.120 --> 08:18.320\n That's a good foundation for surviving emotionally.\n\n08:18.320 --> 08:19.320\n What's that mean?\n\n08:19.320 --> 08:20.320\n Surviving emotionally?\n\n08:20.320 --> 08:23.440\n Like what, what's an ideal life look like while you're thriving?\n\n08:23.440 --> 08:25.100\n You can't take things too seriously.\n\n08:25.100 --> 08:27.600\n You can't, because they're ephemeral.\n\n08:27.600 --> 08:28.600\n They're not permanent.\n\n08:28.600 --> 08:29.600\n Nothing's permanent.\n\n08:29.600 --> 08:30.600\n Your bank account's not permanent.\n\n08:30.600 --> 08:32.600\n Your abilities aren't permanent.\n\n08:32.600 --> 08:33.600\n Nothing's permanent.\n\n08:33.600 --> 08:35.080\n Your abilities aren't permanent.\n\n08:35.080 --> 08:36.080\n Your memory's not permanent.\n\n08:36.080 --> 08:38.080\n Your, your, your dick getting hard is not permanent.\n\n08:38.080 --> 08:43.120\n Can I curse on this or is this go out to, yeah, you can curse to your heart's content.\n\n08:43.120 --> 08:44.120\n Okay.\n\n08:44.120 --> 08:45.120\n Yeah.\n\n08:45.120 --> 08:46.120\n I mean, gender's not even permanent anymore.\n\n08:46.120 --> 08:48.720\n I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna change maybe and live my second half as another gender\n\n08:48.720 --> 08:51.240\n just to have, I'm bored with this gender.\n\n08:51.240 --> 08:53.420\n So it's like nothing is permanent.\n\n08:53.420 --> 08:59.360\n And so accepting that emotionally is a good start to being more flexible.\n\n08:59.360 --> 09:00.640\n You gotta be flexible.\n\n09:00.640 --> 09:03.240\n Like my dad used to say, anything too stiff snaps.\n\n09:03.240 --> 09:07.040\n You gotta, you know, it's a cliche and people have said it a bunch of different ways, but\n\n09:07.040 --> 09:08.040\n Bruce Lee's right, man.\n\n09:08.040 --> 09:09.040\n Be water.\n\n09:09.040 --> 09:10.040\n Be water.\n\n09:10.040 --> 09:11.040\n Yeah.\n\n09:11.040 --> 09:18.000\n Bukowski has this quote about love, that love is a fog that fades with the first light of\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\n reality.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.920\n So he's, he's a romantic, that guy.\n\n09:21.920 --> 09:25.160\n But that even love is a thing that just doesn't last very long.\n\n09:25.160 --> 09:26.160\n No.\n\n09:26.160 --> 09:28.600\n Um, you know, some people would disagree with that.\n\n09:28.600 --> 09:32.280\n Maybe it morphs, like, like, like water, it changes, right?\n\n09:32.280 --> 09:37.280\n It might not be, it might not be this, cause he's mostly just, uh, loved like prostitutes,\n\n09:37.280 --> 09:38.280\n I think.\n\n09:38.280 --> 09:39.280\n So,\n\n09:39.280 --> 09:40.280\n The best kind of love.\n\n09:40.280 --> 09:41.280\n Yeah.\n\n09:41.280 --> 09:42.280\n No demand.\n\n09:42.280 --> 09:43.280\n No, uh, responsibilities.\n\n09:43.280 --> 09:44.280\n Yeah.\n\n09:44.280 --> 09:45.280\n It's a financial transaction.\n\n09:45.280 --> 09:46.280\n Yeah.\n\n09:46.280 --> 09:48.020\n Uh, ephemeral as ever.\n\n09:48.020 --> 09:49.960\n You mentioned your dad.\n\n09:49.960 --> 09:53.760\n He passed away, uh, two, uh, a year and a half ago.\n\n09:53.760 --> 09:54.760\n Yeah.\n\n09:54.760 --> 09:56.320\n What did you learn from him?\n\n09:56.320 --> 09:57.720\n I love my dad.\n\n09:57.720 --> 10:00.720\n My dad, I would say my dad was my, my hero.\n\n10:00.720 --> 10:05.840\n He was just, uh, my dad really embodied those values and I think, um, for better or worse,\n\n10:05.840 --> 10:06.840\n it's made me who I am.\n\n10:06.840 --> 10:13.400\n He's, he, uh, my dad was, was a painter, he was a lawyer, he was, uh, he was, uh, you\n\n10:13.400 --> 10:15.320\n know, a Lieutenant in the military.\n\n10:15.320 --> 10:16.320\n New Yorker.\n\n10:16.320 --> 10:17.320\n New Yorker.\n\n10:17.320 --> 10:18.320\n Born and bred Brooklyn.\n\n10:18.320 --> 10:21.080\n His dad, his dad, you know, uh, surprise owned a diner.\n\n10:21.080 --> 10:24.280\n So that's, that's sort of the Greek passport.\n\n10:24.280 --> 10:27.320\n That's the immigration passport for Greeks into America.\n\n10:27.320 --> 10:29.480\n And, um, yeah, my dad played football.\n\n10:29.480 --> 10:31.440\n He just, my dad did what he wanted.\n\n10:31.440 --> 10:35.320\n He lived as he wanted at all costs and I think I got that from him for better or worse.\n\n10:35.320 --> 10:37.920\n I think it's hurt me in my pursuits.\n\n10:37.920 --> 10:44.920\n Uh, if you consider money and fame, uh, to be paramount, you know, I, I've always done\n\n10:44.920 --> 10:47.760\n what I wanted and if I stopped wanting to do it, I just stopped doing it.\n\n10:47.760 --> 10:48.880\n I think I got that from my dad.\n\n10:48.880 --> 10:52.120\n So maybe for better or worse, that's what I learned from him.\n\n10:52.120 --> 10:55.980\n But that's a real currency, you know, feeling like you're in love with what you're doing\n\n10:55.980 --> 10:59.440\n when you're doing it, maybe perhaps that's worth more than money.\n\n10:59.440 --> 11:01.120\n I don't know.\n\n11:01.120 --> 11:02.120\n You miss him?\n\n11:02.120 --> 11:03.120\n Yeah.\n\n11:03.120 --> 11:04.120\n Every day.\n\n11:04.120 --> 11:05.120\n Every day.\n\n11:05.120 --> 11:08.880\n But I'm happy that, uh, he, he got 91 years.\n\n11:08.880 --> 11:09.880\n It's very rare.\n\n11:09.880 --> 11:12.200\n I mean, he smoked for 60 years.\n\n11:12.200 --> 11:16.160\n Talk about like a guy who was an outlier and he smoked like 60 years, like packs.\n\n11:16.160 --> 11:18.360\n I mean, and he didn't die from that.\n\n11:18.360 --> 11:19.360\n He died.\n\n11:19.360 --> 11:21.560\n He had a prostate cancer, which is the way men should go.\n\n11:21.560 --> 11:22.680\n Your dick should give out.\n\n11:22.680 --> 11:24.160\n It should start from the dick.\n\n11:24.160 --> 11:29.440\n I mean, we focus so much of our life on the dick that that's the way that's a successful\n\n11:29.440 --> 11:33.280\n life and that's why every man eventually gets prostate cancer because that is the universe's\n\n11:33.280 --> 11:38.080\n way of saying like the thing you focused on the most is you put the most energy into is\n\n11:38.080 --> 11:42.240\n the thing that's spent and it's going to, your, your rotting is going to start there.\n\n11:42.240 --> 11:47.320\n So that's a successful life and it just spread all over his body and he slowly died.\n\n11:47.320 --> 11:50.760\n I was with him when he died and that meant a lot to me because me and my brother weren't\n\n11:50.760 --> 11:55.520\n talking at the time cause we're Greeks, we're, we're talking again, but that's how it is.\n\n11:55.520 --> 11:56.520\n You got a few brothers, right?\n\n11:56.520 --> 12:01.260\n I got two brothers, but I wanted to make sure I was with him when he died and I got lucky\n\n12:01.260 --> 12:03.960\n and I was in the room with him when he died.\n\n12:03.960 --> 12:06.400\n You were in the room with your brother and you weren't.\n\n12:06.400 --> 12:07.480\n No, my brother wasn't there.\n\n12:07.480 --> 12:08.600\n We were kind of doing shifts.\n\n12:08.600 --> 12:09.680\n I was, I was there.\n\n12:09.680 --> 12:14.080\n I spent the night, the dad, my, the night my dad died, he died in the early in the morning\n\n12:14.080 --> 12:19.600\n and I heard the death rattle last breath and it was just, I think it was, uh, I, he knew\n\n12:19.600 --> 12:24.540\n I was there and, uh, I think that just probably meant something to him and I'm just glad I\n\n12:24.540 --> 12:25.540\n was there.\n\n12:25.540 --> 12:30.600\n Does that make you sad that, uh, life is ephemeral, like you said, that, that you die?\n\n12:30.600 --> 12:31.600\n Yeah.\n\n12:31.600 --> 12:32.600\n What do you think about your own death?\n\n12:32.600 --> 12:33.880\n You meditate on that?\n\n12:33.880 --> 12:40.440\n I think it, I think the actual, if there is a point to life, it's to, um, hopefully not\n\n12:40.440 --> 12:43.920\n fear death, to accept reality.\n\n12:43.920 --> 12:44.960\n I think that's important.\n\n12:44.960 --> 12:50.320\n I think so much goes awry in the human condition when we lose touch with reality.\n\n12:50.320 --> 12:55.440\n Every, uh, political system that's led to mass murder and everything, I think because\n\n12:55.440 --> 13:02.520\n it's because the, the tenants of those political philosophies ended up being utopian.\n\n13:02.520 --> 13:05.920\n They were detached from reality, detached from nature.\n\n13:05.920 --> 13:11.000\n And so I think it's, it's very important to accept and acknowledge your own mortality.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:16.080\n I think it's the foundation for what makes a good person, a moral person, um, a contributing\n\n13:16.080 --> 13:18.440\n member of society because it's true.\n\n13:18.440 --> 13:21.400\n True things should be the foundation of all things.\n\n13:21.400 --> 13:26.220\n If, if, if what you believe is based on illusion, you're going to end up doing destruction.\n\n13:26.220 --> 13:30.280\n Whether that destruction is on a scale of one to 10, you are going to be destructive\n\n13:30.280 --> 13:31.280\n because it's not real.\n\n13:31.280 --> 13:32.280\n It's a fantasy.\n\n13:32.280 --> 13:33.280\n It doesn't exist.\n\n13:33.280 --> 13:36.940\n See, the thing is the truth is about, I don't think you can ever reach truth.\n\n13:36.940 --> 13:40.720\n Truth is about like constantly digging and to push back on your idea that you should\n\n13:40.720 --> 13:41.880\n accept death.\n\n13:41.880 --> 13:47.040\n I think the more honest response to death, so the least honest is to run away from it,\n\n13:47.040 --> 13:51.980\n create illusions that help you imagine that there's not a death.\n\n13:51.980 --> 13:59.680\n Uh, the next is to accept it, but the real honest one is to fear it because I, I, I mean,\n\n13:59.680 --> 14:04.960\n I'm, I'm with, uh, Ernest Becker is a philosopher, uh, wrote a book called Denial of Death.\n\n14:04.960 --> 14:10.560\n He says that the, like much of the human condition is based in the fear of mortality.\n\n14:10.560 --> 14:15.080\n That we like, that's, that's the creative force of the human energy.\n\n14:15.080 --> 14:17.320\n Like Freud said, do you want to sleep with your mother?\n\n14:17.320 --> 14:20.240\n He said, no, that's not what motivates you.\n\n14:20.240 --> 14:21.480\n Maybe his mom wasn't hot though.\n\n14:21.480 --> 14:26.280\n I mean, or he wasn't Greek because apparently at a poll, we found that we found that all\n\n14:26.280 --> 14:27.280\n things good and bad.\n\n14:27.280 --> 14:28.280\n Yeah.\n\n14:28.280 --> 14:29.280\n Thanks.\n\n14:29.280 --> 14:30.280\n Thanks for that.\n\n14:30.280 --> 14:31.280\n Thanks.\n\n14:31.280 --> 14:32.280\n I just don't know if his mom was a looker or not.\n\n14:32.280 --> 14:33.280\n I mean, I'd have to Google it.\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:34.280\n All right.\n\n14:34.280 --> 14:35.280\n Yeah.\n\n14:35.280 --> 14:37.000\n I'll look up on Google images.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\n Yeah.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:44.440\n But I think the honest, as he says, the thing that we run away from is that there's a terror.\n\n14:44.440 --> 14:45.920\n He calls it like terror.\n\n14:45.920 --> 14:48.600\n Uh, there's something called terror management theory.\n\n14:48.600 --> 14:54.040\n That's some philosophers after him followed on that we're basically trying to run away\n\n14:54.040 --> 15:00.040\n from this fear and acceptance is actually creating an illusion for yourself.\n\n15:00.040 --> 15:03.560\n Like you can actually accept something as terrifying as this.\n\n15:03.560 --> 15:07.320\n So he's more with the stoics, the stoic constantly meditate on their death.\n\n15:07.320 --> 15:09.480\n I mean, they, what does that mean?\n\n15:09.480 --> 15:15.640\n I mean, it's kind of, it's, you know, acceptance of death isn't a thing you do like on a Monday\n\n15:15.640 --> 15:22.280\n and then you're done is a thing you constantly have to meditate on, like reminding yourself\n\n15:22.280 --> 15:23.840\n like this ride is over.\n\n15:23.840 --> 15:25.280\n It could be over today.\n\n15:25.280 --> 15:29.360\n And that's something you're, if you think about every single day, it gives you an appreciation\n\n15:29.360 --> 15:34.920\n of Woody Allen movies, at least it gives you appreciation of basically everything, including\n\n15:34.920 --> 15:39.680\n Woody Allen movies, which shows you how deep your appreciation for life could be.\n\n15:39.680 --> 15:44.480\n I've actually haven't been following much about what Woody Allen's, but apparently he's\n\n15:44.480 --> 15:47.000\n been a troublemaker through most of his life.\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:48.000\n He's yeah.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:49.600\n I mean, you know, he's caused a little bit of strife.\n\n15:49.600 --> 15:53.400\n He's left a little, uh, yeah, he's left a little confusion in his wake for sure.\n\n15:53.400 --> 15:58.040\n But I mean, you know, that's another one separate the art from the artist.\n\n15:58.040 --> 16:02.800\n He's got, I mean, the guys will go down in history as the greatest he's made, I mean,\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:06.880\n maybe a year and they're all, you can always find something good about each movie, like\n\n16:06.880 --> 16:08.440\n the dialogue or whatever.\n\n16:08.440 --> 16:09.980\n Um, I love what you're saying.\n\n16:09.980 --> 16:12.480\n It's interesting, but the only thing I would say to push back a little bit since we're\n\n16:12.480 --> 16:17.560\n playing a little table tennis here is, um, I don't know if it's a choice to fear death.\n\n16:17.560 --> 16:19.720\n That's more of an, it seems more instinctual.\n\n16:19.720 --> 16:24.440\n It seems like something that nature wants you to do because I've been in positions where\n\n16:24.440 --> 16:25.480\n I thought I was going to die.\n\n16:25.480 --> 16:31.960\n Like I've been shot and I had those moments and then nature also, uh, you know, kicks\n\n16:31.960 --> 16:36.280\n in an instinct, which is acceptance where you kind of, I don't know, it's a chemical\n\n16:36.280 --> 16:37.280\n release or whatever.\n\n16:37.280 --> 16:39.960\n I don't know, you know, we're all, we're robots basically.\n\n16:39.960 --> 16:44.320\n So some sort of chemical is released that protects you, but there is an acceptance.\n\n16:44.320 --> 16:48.640\n I don't know how much, uh, of it was a conscious choice, probably very little.\n\n16:48.640 --> 16:51.520\n Um, and that's the point I'm making is it's, it's instinctual.\n\n16:51.520 --> 16:53.640\n We don't really have a choice in fearing death.\n\n16:53.640 --> 16:55.520\n Otherwise there would be no progression.\n\n16:55.520 --> 17:02.840\n We wouldn't all life seems to want to survive, uh, not by choice, but by instinct.\n\n17:02.840 --> 17:07.360\n So he, he argues that the fear is not the instinctual of, it's not the animalistic stuff.\n\n17:07.360 --> 17:11.960\n That's the thing that makes us special is the, what humans are able to do is to have\n\n17:11.960 --> 17:14.120\n a knowledge that we're going to die one day.\n\n17:14.120 --> 17:15.720\n Animals don't have that animals.\n\n17:15.720 --> 17:16.720\n Fear is instinctual.\n\n17:16.720 --> 17:19.620\n It's like, Holy shit, what's that sound over there?\n\n17:19.620 --> 17:25.360\n He says, we're actually able to contemplate the fact that this ride ends and that that\n\n17:25.360 --> 17:29.400\n kind of cognitive construct is difficult for us to deal with.\n\n17:29.400 --> 17:31.480\n Like what the hell does that mean?\n\n17:31.480 --> 17:38.880\n Like just to, just to think about, it's going to be over at a certain point, it's just over\n\n17:38.880 --> 17:39.880\n lights out.\n\n17:39.880 --> 17:46.920\n Like it's very difficult to kind of load that into whatever this like little brain we got.\n\n17:46.920 --> 17:49.160\n Like, what does that actually mean?\n\n17:49.160 --> 17:51.480\n Maybe that's what gives everything meaning.\n\n17:51.480 --> 17:52.480\n Yeah.\n\n17:52.480 --> 17:56.720\n Because if everything lasted forever, if, uh, if this went on ad infinitum, there would\n\n17:56.720 --> 17:57.720\n be no meaning to it.\n\n17:57.720 --> 18:00.640\n I'd be like, Hey, if I don't see you tomorrow, I'll see in a million years, there would be\n\n18:00.640 --> 18:01.640\n no meaning.\n\n18:01.640 --> 18:02.640\n There'll be no urgency.\n\n18:02.640 --> 18:03.640\n There would be no feelings.\n\n18:03.640 --> 18:07.760\n There'd be no, uh, nothing of magnitude or superficiality.\n\n18:07.760 --> 18:10.960\n It would all just be this kind of, it would be torture.\n\n18:10.960 --> 18:13.960\n It would actually, that would actually be torture to be here forever.\n\n18:13.960 --> 18:17.680\n I mean, I'm already sick of this place and I'm just in my forties.\n\n18:17.680 --> 18:18.680\n Like I'm done.\n\n18:18.680 --> 18:19.680\n I'm sick of me.\n\n18:19.680 --> 18:20.680\n I'm sick of everything.\n\n18:20.680 --> 18:27.440\n You know, a lot of people, when they talk about mortality, they consider, they consider\n\n18:27.440 --> 18:33.840\n mortality appealing because you get a chance to do basically all these things you might\n\n18:33.840 --> 18:38.460\n not get a chance to do otherwise, like all the kinds of travel broadly, explore, read\n\n18:38.460 --> 18:43.240\n every book, explore every idea, do every hobby, all those kinds of things.\n\n18:43.240 --> 18:50.760\n The idea I was talking to mentioned, uh, the reality of being immortal would be more likely,\n\n18:50.760 --> 18:57.600\n I like this idea, more likely would be you just sitting there doing nothing because,\n\n18:57.600 --> 19:03.280\n and putting off all that travel and exploration to later because you'll always have time.\n\n19:03.280 --> 19:07.080\n And so what you're going to have, what actual immortality would look like for a bunch of\n\n19:07.080 --> 19:09.680\n humans is people sitting there doing nothing.\n\n19:09.680 --> 19:12.800\n It would be like a Greek caffineer just sitting around drinking coffee.\n\n19:12.800 --> 19:13.800\n I love it.\n\n19:13.800 --> 19:14.800\n Yeah.\n\n19:14.800 --> 19:16.280\n I mean, it's a lazy man's paradise.\n\n19:16.280 --> 19:17.280\n Yeah.\n\n19:17.280 --> 19:21.320\n But it's so interesting because that, that's, that rings true to me for what humans are\n\n19:21.320 --> 19:27.040\n like is we'll basically just put off all those exciting adventures and just be lazy, become\n\n19:27.040 --> 19:30.520\n lazier and lazier and lazier because you'll always have a chance to do all the exciting\n\n19:30.520 --> 19:33.720\n things and we'll just get, we'll basically become Tim Dillon.\n\n19:33.720 --> 19:36.720\n We just sit there and have a podcast and that's it.\n\n19:36.720 --> 19:37.720\n He works hard.\n\n19:37.720 --> 19:38.720\n Um, yeah.\n\n19:38.720 --> 19:40.480\n I mean, that sounds actually like heaven, dude.\n\n19:40.480 --> 19:41.640\n That's speaking to my heart really.\n\n19:41.640 --> 19:44.720\n I mean, I'm at heart, I'm a very lazy person.\n\n19:44.720 --> 19:47.680\n I always try to find ways to lie down.\n\n19:47.680 --> 19:51.460\n Like if I'm sitting, I'll figure out a way to kind of contort myself to later.\n\n19:51.460 --> 19:54.000\n That's an interesting thing to like in, yeah.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:59.360\n If you can always push something off, yeah, that, I like that.\n\n19:59.360 --> 20:01.360\n I think that's heaven.\n\n20:01.360 --> 20:02.360\n And um,\n\n20:02.360 --> 20:03.600\n See, we just changed your mind.\n\n20:03.600 --> 20:04.880\n You kind of like the immortality.\n\n20:04.880 --> 20:05.880\n Yeah.\n\n20:05.880 --> 20:06.880\n I kind of like it.\n\n20:06.880 --> 20:07.880\n No.\n\n20:07.880 --> 20:08.880\n So there'll be no thirsts.\n\n20:08.880 --> 20:09.880\n No.\n\n20:09.880 --> 20:10.880\n You can always put it off.\n\n20:10.880 --> 20:11.880\n You don't want to bang this girl.\n\n20:11.880 --> 20:13.920\n You're like, ah, put it off.\n\n20:13.920 --> 20:16.680\n But now I'm thinking about Muslim heaven and they may be offering the best deal.\n\n20:16.680 --> 20:23.160\n I mean, if it was an expo and they had a booth, I may go with them because they offer, they\n\n20:23.160 --> 20:26.240\n offer 62 or 72, but then I'd get sick of them.\n\n20:26.240 --> 20:28.080\n I'd want to, I don't know.\n\n20:28.080 --> 20:33.300\n I always wondered like, are you given the 62 virgins or you choose, can you create them\n\n20:33.300 --> 20:36.540\n like an avatar, like a video game, or are you just given?\n\n20:36.540 --> 20:39.280\n I don't know what the number, why it's important to have that high number.\n\n20:39.280 --> 20:44.800\n First of all, I think it's a mistranslation about the virgins, but outside of that, outside\n\n20:44.800 --> 20:48.160\n of that, I feel like the conversation is really important.\n\n20:48.160 --> 20:52.400\n I don't think they ever specify like what kind of books these girls read.\n\n20:52.400 --> 20:54.920\n Like what are they, what are they into?\n\n20:54.920 --> 20:59.080\n Like the quality of the conversation, I think if you're talking about eternity, the quality\n\n20:59.080 --> 21:03.000\n of the intellect and the conversation and the personalities is way more important.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:07.120\n And the Greeks have an ancient, ancient expression, pat metronaros stone, which my mother always\n\n21:07.120 --> 21:10.680\n used to say, which is everything in moderation, nothing in excess.\n\n21:10.680 --> 21:16.620\n So trying to always get the status quo and uh, yeah, that many women, eventually it's\n\n21:16.620 --> 21:19.560\n like the magic Johnson effect, Isaiah Thomas effect.\n\n21:19.560 --> 21:22.480\n It's just too much and you're going to end up, you're going to end up banging a dude\n\n21:22.480 --> 21:23.480\n is what I'm saying.\n\n21:23.480 --> 21:27.740\n You're going to get sick of it cause it's too much and there's going to be a eunuch\n\n21:27.740 --> 21:29.720\n that finds its way into your harem.\n\n21:29.720 --> 21:33.840\n That's been proven throughout history, every empire, when you have all that power.\n\n21:33.840 --> 21:35.980\n And again, this goes back to power corrupting.\n\n21:35.980 --> 21:40.560\n If you have, if there's no struggle, there's no meaning, there's the value is from the\n\n21:40.560 --> 21:43.040\n journey, the, the working hard to struggle.\n\n21:43.040 --> 21:47.800\n And if it's just given to you because you're a Sultan or you're Alexander the Great or\n\n21:47.800 --> 21:50.960\n whatever, you're going to get bored and you're going to bang a dude.\n\n21:50.960 --> 21:54.000\n That's it's, I think that's a scientific axiom actually.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.600\n Eventually you'll get bored and bang a dude.\n\n21:55.600 --> 21:57.320\n Yeah, but I think it won't stop there.\n\n21:57.320 --> 21:59.240\n I think you'll go to animals, you go to robot.\n\n21:59.240 --> 22:02.980\n I mean, eventually it all ends up in robots and then the robots rebel and then the humans\n\n22:02.980 --> 22:03.980\n will be destroyed.\n\n22:03.980 --> 22:04.980\n Yeah.\n\n22:04.980 --> 22:05.980\n I'm sorry.\n\n22:05.980 --> 22:12.320\n If, if we're speaking truth, you said the value of life, one of the highest ideals is\n\n22:12.320 --> 22:13.320\n to seek truth.\n\n22:13.320 --> 22:14.320\n I think if we're being honest.\n\n22:14.320 --> 22:15.320\n Can I ask you a quick question?\n\n22:15.320 --> 22:16.320\n Yes.\n\n22:16.320 --> 22:18.200\n If you, if you live in a small, I come from small islands, right?\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:20.480\n And so there's a stereotype that that's where they bang animals.\n\n22:20.480 --> 22:24.320\n But if you come from a very small community, you know, an island or something, and you\n\n22:24.320 --> 22:28.040\n have the choice of banging a family member or an animal, which one is worse on the moral\n\n22:28.040 --> 22:29.040\n scale?\n\n22:29.040 --> 22:31.760\n Because you're technically not related to the animal.\n\n22:31.760 --> 22:32.760\n Right.\n\n22:32.760 --> 22:33.760\n This is interesting.\n\n22:33.760 --> 22:37.280\n I mean, these are human constructs, these ideas, but yet for me personally, taboo would\n\n22:37.280 --> 22:40.720\n be more taboo to, uh, to, to have sex with a family member.\n\n22:40.720 --> 22:41.720\n Yeah.\n\n22:41.720 --> 22:42.720\n I mean, animal.\n\n22:42.720 --> 22:43.720\n I mean, okay.\n\n22:43.720 --> 22:44.720\n It's good to know where you stand on that.\n\n22:44.720 --> 22:47.720\n I think if viewers, you know, if they didn't have, they didn't know they had that question.\n\n22:47.720 --> 22:49.800\n I just, they just learned a little bit about you.\n\n22:49.800 --> 22:50.800\n And now I know.\n\n22:50.800 --> 22:53.240\n I look forward to the internet clipping that out.\n\n22:53.240 --> 22:54.240\n Yeah.\n\n22:54.240 --> 23:01.400\n I mean, there, there is, listen, uh, in some, outside of, outside of that, I do think about\n\n23:01.400 --> 23:02.400\n that a lot.\n\n23:02.400 --> 23:06.840\n I think it's kind of ridiculous, uh, about morality connected to animals in terms of\n\n23:06.840 --> 23:10.000\n all the, the, the factory farming and so on.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:14.600\n It seems like that's one of the things we'll look, cause I love meat, but I kind of feel\n\n23:14.600 --> 23:21.160\n bad about it and, and bad in a way where I think if we look like a hundred years from\n\n23:21.160 --> 23:28.400\n now, we'll look back at this time as like one of the great like tortures and injustices\n\n23:28.400 --> 23:30.480\n that we humans have committed.\n\n23:30.480 --> 23:34.960\n And I mean, all that has to do with the sex with the animal has to do with consent and\n\n23:34.960 --> 23:37.720\n about the experience of suffering of animals.\n\n23:37.720 --> 23:42.480\n The reason I think about that personally a lot, cause I think about robotics, I think\n\n23:42.480 --> 23:50.540\n about creating artificial consciousnesses, uh, or artificial like beings that have some\n\n23:50.540 --> 23:52.280\n elements of the human nature.\n\n23:52.280 --> 23:55.560\n And then you start to think like, well, what does it mean to suffer?\n\n23:55.560 --> 24:00.860\n What does it mean for entity to exist such that it deserves rights?\n\n24:00.860 --> 24:05.120\n This is something that the founding fathers were thinking about, like, you know, all men\n\n24:05.120 --> 24:06.120\n are created equal.\n\n24:06.120 --> 24:11.560\n What does it, which, who is included in the men who, who's not in that, in that sentence\n\n24:11.560 --> 24:14.440\n and our animals included in that are robots.\n\n24:14.440 --> 24:18.240\n I honestly think that there will be a civil rights movement for robots in the future.\n\n24:18.240 --> 24:19.960\n I don't, I don't know.\n\n24:19.960 --> 24:23.040\n Is that the Turing test, the way you try to, is that what they call it where you're trying\n\n24:23.040 --> 24:28.920\n to see if AI can think like a human or whatever, or feel like a human?\n\n24:28.920 --> 24:34.640\n Well, it's a, the Turing test closely defined as more about talk like a human.\n\n24:34.640 --> 24:39.720\n So you can, you can imagine systems that are able to, you can have a conversation like\n\n24:39.720 --> 24:46.360\n this and I would be a robot for example, but that doesn't mean I would do in a, in society.\n\n24:46.360 --> 24:50.880\n That doesn't mean I deserve rights or that doesn't mean I would be conscious.\n\n24:50.880 --> 24:55.840\n It doesn't mean that I would be able to suffer and to experience pleasure and dream and all\n\n24:55.840 --> 24:57.840\n those kinds of human things.\n\n24:57.840 --> 25:01.300\n The question isn't whether you're able to talk, which is passed in the Turing test.\n\n25:01.300 --> 25:08.760\n The question is whether you're able to feel, to be, I mean, I go back to suffering.\n\n25:08.760 --> 25:14.560\n The thing that the, that our documents protect us against is suffering.\n\n25:14.560 --> 25:17.280\n Like we don't want humans to suffer.\n\n25:17.280 --> 25:25.280\n And if a robot can suffer, that discussion starts being about like, well, shouldn't we\n\n25:25.280 --> 25:27.420\n protect them?\n\n25:27.420 --> 25:29.040\n Currently we don't protect animals.\n\n25:29.040 --> 25:30.420\n We protect that dog.\n\n25:30.420 --> 25:31.420\n There's laws.\n\n25:31.420 --> 25:34.080\n There's actual legislation that protects dogs for torture places.\n\n25:34.080 --> 25:35.080\n Yeah.\n\n25:35.080 --> 25:36.080\n And you know what?\n\n25:36.080 --> 25:38.860\n Dogs is something I don't think people really understand enough about.\n\n25:38.860 --> 25:39.920\n It's one of my obsessions.\n\n25:39.920 --> 25:45.980\n So they, they, my dad always used to say those, he goes, those things are, those things are\n\n25:45.980 --> 25:47.340\n basically human.\n\n25:47.340 --> 25:51.080\n And I mean, they dream, they have anxiety.\n\n25:51.080 --> 25:55.200\n And what people often overlook about dogs is without dogs, we wouldn't be here.\n\n25:55.200 --> 26:03.980\n We would not have ever evolved from hunter gatherer to agrarian to, you know, civilization.\n\n26:03.980 --> 26:05.180\n We wouldn't have cities.\n\n26:05.180 --> 26:06.180\n We wouldn't have anything.\n\n26:06.180 --> 26:10.620\n I mean, they are our partner in survival and they are a magical animal.\n\n26:10.620 --> 26:14.280\n There's no, there's no animal that was, it was like destiny almost.\n\n26:14.280 --> 26:19.180\n I mean, a malleable animal, there's no animal that's that malleable that in a few generations\n\n26:19.180 --> 26:22.680\n you can tailor to a specific job that you need.\n\n26:22.680 --> 26:28.300\n And without that animal, without dogs doing that animal, protecting our crops from, from,\n\n26:28.300 --> 26:32.940\n you know scavengers and stuff like that, you know, the list goes on.\n\n26:32.940 --> 26:34.100\n We wouldn't be here.\n\n26:34.100 --> 26:41.860\n So we, that's an often overlooked fact that human evolution was not done in a vacuum just\n\n26:41.860 --> 26:42.860\n with humans.\n\n26:42.860 --> 26:44.260\n Without dogs, we would have never evolved.\n\n26:44.260 --> 26:46.460\n I mean, we weren't the apex predator for most of our existence.\n\n26:46.460 --> 26:47.460\n We weren't even the apex predator.\n\n26:47.460 --> 26:51.500\n I mean, we're getting eaten by hyenas, which is my favorite animal and you know, that's\n\n26:51.500 --> 26:54.420\n kind of an injustice to, I mean, I'm kind of mad at dogs.\n\n26:54.420 --> 26:59.980\n We deserve to get eaten by hyenas, but without dogs, we wouldn't be here and dogs, dogs deserve\n\n26:59.980 --> 27:00.980\n the protection.\n\n27:00.980 --> 27:01.980\n So do horses.\n\n27:01.980 --> 27:06.220\n They fucking lugged us around for thousands of years and now these fucking German psychopaths\n\n27:06.220 --> 27:07.920\n are eating them or whatever.\n\n27:07.920 --> 27:11.820\n We should not eat horse meat just on like, be a good dude, man.\n\n27:11.820 --> 27:15.740\n These things lugged us around for generations, they're beautiful, you know, ride them or\n\n27:15.740 --> 27:16.740\n I don't know.\n\n27:16.740 --> 27:19.980\n I don't know, but it rubs me the wrong way that we eat horses.\n\n27:19.980 --> 27:24.780\n Yeah, the horses one is interesting and one of my favorite books is Animal Farm by Orwell\n\n27:24.780 --> 27:31.460\n and the horses don't get a good ending in that, I kind of, my spirit animal I suppose\n\n27:31.460 --> 27:36.480\n is the horse from Animal Farm, Boxer, where he says, I will work harder.\n\n27:36.480 --> 27:37.900\n That's his motto.\n\n27:37.900 --> 27:41.300\n I work really hard at stupid things.\n\n27:41.300 --> 27:45.180\n That's basically what I, I just hit my head against the wall for no reason whatsoever.\n\n27:45.180 --> 27:47.980\n But that probably fulfills, you have a big brain, you were probably born with a big brain\n\n27:47.980 --> 27:48.980\n that kind of fulfills.\n\n27:48.980 --> 27:50.380\n It's killing neurons.\n\n27:50.380 --> 27:51.380\n It's exercise for you.\n\n27:51.380 --> 27:52.380\n Yeah.\n\n27:52.380 --> 27:53.380\n Yeah.\n\n27:53.380 --> 27:54.940\n Don't you think some animals deserve to be eaten though?\n\n27:54.940 --> 27:55.940\n Kind of like.\n\n27:55.940 --> 27:56.940\n Hyenas.\n\n27:56.940 --> 27:57.940\n Come on, dude.\n\n27:57.940 --> 28:00.140\n I mean, you gotta respect the hyena.\n\n28:00.140 --> 28:03.020\n Okay, so let's look, first of all, let me just comment on the dog thing.\n\n28:03.020 --> 28:08.460\n There is like conferences on dog cognition from a perspective of people that study psychology,\n\n28:08.460 --> 28:12.340\n cognitive science, neuroscience, dogs are fascinating.\n\n28:12.340 --> 28:15.980\n The way they move their eyes, they're able to, they're the only other animal besides\n\n28:15.980 --> 28:18.880\n humans, they're able to communicate with their eyes.\n\n28:18.880 --> 28:23.300\n They can look at a thing and look back at you and look back at the thing to communicate\n\n28:23.300 --> 28:27.080\n that we're all like through our eyes, communicate that we're collaborating.\n\n28:27.080 --> 28:31.620\n So every other animal uses their eyes to actually look at things.\n\n28:31.620 --> 28:35.420\n The dogs use it to like communicate with you, with us humans.\n\n28:35.420 --> 28:36.420\n It's fascinating.\n\n28:36.420 --> 28:38.620\n There are a lot of other elements of dogs that are amazing.\n\n28:38.620 --> 28:42.900\n Yeah, I mean, if it wasn't for them, they're the ones, they were our first alarm system\n\n28:42.900 --> 28:43.900\n for predators.\n\n28:43.900 --> 28:44.900\n They would defend us.\n\n28:44.900 --> 28:46.420\n I mean, the Basenji is one of the most ancient dogs.\n\n28:46.420 --> 28:49.780\n I mean, they're tiny, but they're fearless and they would chase off lions.\n\n28:49.780 --> 28:54.500\n Like there'd be packs of them and they chase off lions and protect the tribes.\n\n28:54.500 --> 28:59.020\n I even get tingles like thinking about dogs because I have a dog, I love my dog.\n\n28:59.020 --> 29:02.820\n And there's something about when you're walking with your dog off leash in the woods, there's\n\n29:02.820 --> 29:09.180\n something about it that's like, that tugs at that millions of years of evolution, like\n\n29:09.180 --> 29:13.900\n that gut, you know, it's like, I had a Finnish friend of mine, he's a comic, Tommy Valamies\n\n29:13.900 --> 29:18.480\n once told me, he was like, he was like, the gut, he's like, I believe in it.\n\n29:18.480 --> 29:21.860\n Like that gut, you know, when you have that feeling, he's like, always trust that because\n\n29:21.860 --> 29:25.760\n that is million, those are all your ancestors.\n\n29:25.760 --> 29:30.820\n That's the survival instinct of all your ancestors at the beginning of time, you know, telling\n\n29:30.820 --> 29:34.100\n you like, Hey, something's off here, something's, you know, so don't get in the car with Ted\n\n29:34.100 --> 29:38.300\n Bundy is what I'm saying, ladies, how fucking stupid, who, how can you fall for that?\n\n29:38.300 --> 29:40.660\n You know, he's got a fucking sling on, don't get in.\n\n29:40.660 --> 29:41.660\n Yeah.\n\n29:41.660 --> 29:42.660\n Follow the gut.\n\n29:42.660 --> 29:46.260\n My question to you, are psychopaths essentially robots?\n\n29:46.260 --> 29:51.620\n So first of all, let's not, you're using the word robot in a derogatory way that I, I'm\n\n29:51.620 --> 29:52.620\n triggered by.\n\n29:52.620 --> 29:53.620\n Okay.\n\n29:53.620 --> 29:54.620\n So I feel offended.\n\n29:54.620 --> 29:59.420\n You should be because you know what, people are always scared of robots, but I actually,\n\n29:59.420 --> 30:05.180\n I have, I've made the sort of, uh, I, I've made it to say, Hey, I've, I thought about\n\n30:05.180 --> 30:07.660\n it and like robot, robots have been nothing but helpful.\n\n30:07.660 --> 30:09.500\n It's the people we should be scared of.\n\n30:09.500 --> 30:15.180\n Again, we're kind of missing the most destructive thing is us because it's, but robots are helpful.\n\n30:15.180 --> 30:17.020\n I mean, this is a fucking robot.\n\n30:17.020 --> 30:20.480\n You know, I went on hotel tonight, I'm already booked up, you know, I got my, I can change\n\n30:20.480 --> 30:24.580\n my flight if, if this barbecue with Rogan goes 16 hours, which whatever Rogan wants\n\n30:24.580 --> 30:25.580\n to do, I'll do it.\n\n30:25.580 --> 30:29.380\n If he wants to kick me in the chest, I'll let him kick me in the chest, whatever.\n\n30:29.380 --> 30:30.380\n Robots are helpful.\n\n30:30.380 --> 30:31.380\n No?\n\n30:31.380 --> 30:32.380\n Yeah.\n\n30:32.380 --> 30:35.060\n Uh, tanks and autonomous weapons systems don't kill people.\n\n30:35.060 --> 30:36.060\n People kill people.\n\n30:36.060 --> 30:37.060\n Yeah.\n\n30:37.060 --> 30:38.060\n That's yeah.\n\n30:38.060 --> 30:39.060\n Yeah.\n\n30:39.060 --> 30:42.060\n The NRA is about to collect that for you.\n\n30:42.060 --> 30:44.460\n Uh, a lot of love for dogs.\n\n30:44.460 --> 30:45.460\n I appreciate it very much.\n\n30:45.460 --> 30:49.540\n And at the same time, you have the other thing that people seem to have love for, which is\n\n30:49.540 --> 30:50.660\n cats.\n\n30:50.660 --> 30:56.140\n And on the flip side of everything you've said, I'm trying to understand what have cats\n\n30:56.140 --> 30:58.040\n ever done for human civilization?\n\n30:58.040 --> 30:59.420\n They keep rodents away.\n\n30:59.420 --> 31:01.380\n The domesticated cat is very important.\n\n31:01.380 --> 31:02.380\n Keeps the rodents away.\n\n31:02.380 --> 31:03.380\n Yeah.\n\n31:03.380 --> 31:04.380\n That's what they were domesticated for.\n\n31:04.380 --> 31:10.100\n I mean, they're psychopathic killers who ended up killing, uh, innocent, um, neighborhood\n\n31:10.100 --> 31:18.140\n chipmunks and, and birds, uh, they really affect the, uh, the balance of the local ecosystem.\n\n31:18.140 --> 31:22.780\n But if you have love for cats too, not as much as dogs, I mean, dogs are, like you said,\n\n31:22.780 --> 31:23.780\n they look at humans.\n\n31:23.780 --> 31:26.980\n I actually read an article that some people were theorizing they're smarter than chimps\n\n31:26.980 --> 31:29.100\n because of the way they can work with humans.\n\n31:29.100 --> 31:33.860\n And there was one border collie that spoke like 300 words, like a quarter, like a lang,\n\n31:33.860 --> 31:35.500\n almost part of the language.\n\n31:35.500 --> 31:36.780\n And their nose is like a mat.\n\n31:36.780 --> 31:38.380\n I mean, that's like magic, dude.\n\n31:38.380 --> 31:43.340\n If you can smell in my ass to what I had for breakfast from miles away, that's intelligence.\n\n31:43.340 --> 31:44.340\n That's intelligence.\n\n31:44.340 --> 31:48.760\n I mean, in some ways that their nose, if you were to put it on a scale, maybe their nose\n\n31:48.760 --> 31:51.980\n is more intelligent than our brain for what it does.\n\n31:51.980 --> 31:54.940\n You know, it's like, I mean, dude, they can smell you from miles away.\n\n31:54.940 --> 31:57.340\n You ever see a dog just like sniffing, catching?\n\n31:57.340 --> 32:01.900\n I mean, it's smelling like, I don't remember the, the, the date on it, but it's like, they\n\n32:01.900 --> 32:06.340\n have like millions of receptors or something where we only, you know, thank God we don't\n\n32:06.340 --> 32:07.340\n have their nose.\n\n32:07.340 --> 32:13.700\n That would be, that would make sex weird, be a little too intense.\n\n32:13.700 --> 32:18.060\n I think you mentioned when you were talking about Woody Allen separating the, the art\n\n32:18.060 --> 32:19.460\n from the artist.\n\n32:19.460 --> 32:24.780\n So that brings to mind Vladimir Putin.\n\n32:24.780 --> 32:25.780\n How about that transition?\n\n32:25.780 --> 32:26.780\n I don't know.\n\n32:26.780 --> 32:29.140\n I'm so sorry.\n\n32:29.140 --> 32:36.220\n But if you look at just powerful leaders throughout history, Stalin, Hitler, but even modern ones\n\n32:36.220 --> 32:40.580\n like Putin, and we're talking about power.\n\n32:40.580 --> 32:42.280\n How do you explain them?\n\n32:42.280 --> 32:50.580\n You said that power reveals, not corrupts, but do you think there's some element to which\n\n32:50.580 --> 32:55.340\n power corrupted Hitler, power corrupted Stalin after he gained power?\n\n32:55.340 --> 32:56.860\n And the same with Putin.\n\n32:56.860 --> 33:01.780\n When Putin gained power in 2000, do you think the amount of power that he was in possession\n\n33:01.780 --> 33:04.420\n with for many years, do you think that corrupted him?\n\n33:04.420 --> 33:07.900\n I mean, we're joking about dictators get the job done.\n\n33:07.900 --> 33:16.680\n There is some sense in certain countries where a dictator is the only thing that can stabilize\n\n33:16.680 --> 33:19.380\n a nation.\n\n33:19.380 --> 33:24.780\n The counter argument to that for democracies is like, yeah, but that's a short term solution\n\n33:24.780 --> 33:26.140\n for a long term problem.\n\n33:26.140 --> 33:29.140\n So you want to embrace chaos with democracy.\n\n33:29.140 --> 33:30.520\n That might be violent.\n\n33:30.520 --> 33:35.540\n There might be a lot of just constant changing of leadership.\n\n33:35.540 --> 33:42.060\n There might be a lot of corruption in the short term, but if you stay strong with the\n\n33:42.060 --> 33:47.860\n ideals of democracy, then you'll be ultimately create something that as beautiful and stable\n\n33:47.860 --> 33:51.580\n as the United States.\n\n33:51.580 --> 33:55.660\n The sad thing is, is I don't know if history tells that story.\n\n33:55.660 --> 33:59.740\n It's like I said, you look at Greece, you look at Rome, democracy kind of failed.\n\n33:59.740 --> 34:07.460\n The majority of Rome, the most successful empire that we've had, was a dictatorship\n\n34:07.460 --> 34:10.760\n for most of its run.\n\n34:10.760 --> 34:14.460\n But I do believe in a republic, which is sort of a limited democracy.\n\n34:14.460 --> 34:17.060\n I do believe in what we have here.\n\n34:17.060 --> 34:18.060\n I believe in common law.\n\n34:18.060 --> 34:23.700\n I believe in individual rights.\n\n34:23.700 --> 34:26.580\n But yeah, I think you said it.\n\n34:26.580 --> 34:27.580\n Nobody could have said it better.\n\n34:27.580 --> 34:28.580\n Yeah.\n\n34:28.580 --> 34:29.580\n It's a short term solution.\n\n34:29.580 --> 34:35.840\n You look at Saddam Hussein, he kind of, when we took him out, then there was a lot of infighting\n\n34:35.840 --> 34:43.100\n that happened that he was kind of keeping at bay because he was a strong man, dictator.\n\n34:43.100 --> 34:46.220\n Well, he's an interesting one, sorry to interrupt.\n\n34:46.220 --> 34:50.140\n From my understanding, I'm sure people will correct me, but when Saddam Hussein first\n\n34:50.140 --> 34:54.720\n came to power, he was, he's quite progressive.\n\n34:54.720 --> 35:03.200\n So like the, as far as I understand, the signs of an evil dictator weren't exactly there.\n\n35:03.200 --> 35:07.340\n So again, there's, I don't know if power revealed or power corrupted.\n\n35:07.340 --> 35:11.280\n Or that could have been the initial subterfuge to kind of get everybody, you know, Hitler\n\n35:11.280 --> 35:13.260\n also is a champion of the people.\n\n35:13.260 --> 35:14.260\n It's built some new roads.\n\n35:14.260 --> 35:15.880\n It's with psychopaths too.\n\n35:15.880 --> 35:17.060\n And that's why it's interesting to me.\n\n35:17.060 --> 35:20.460\n I'm not sure if power corrupts psychopaths.\n\n35:20.460 --> 35:23.720\n And now that we know that we can do these CAT scans and brain scans, we know that they're\n\n35:23.720 --> 35:25.760\n born that way.\n\n35:25.760 --> 35:33.640\n Power definitely corrupts people who have the capacity to feel and for empathy.\n\n35:33.640 --> 35:34.640\n Power I'm not sure.\n\n35:34.640 --> 35:41.340\n I don't think power corrupts people who were born psychopathic with that condition or sociopaths\n\n35:41.340 --> 35:46.680\n who had, who, you know, who were closer to psychopath and then had some traumatic life.\n\n35:46.680 --> 35:52.220\n You know, I just think, you know, the best way to get away with whatever nefarious thing\n\n35:52.220 --> 35:56.400\n you want to do to feel, I guess the only thing psychopaths can feel is that excitement, is\n\n35:56.400 --> 35:58.960\n to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.\n\n35:58.960 --> 36:00.720\n That's what, that's what killers do.\n\n36:00.720 --> 36:02.720\n That's what the worst people, look at Bill Cosby.\n\n36:02.720 --> 36:08.720\n I mean, he was, what better way to hide, you know, it's like what wokeness is now.\n\n36:08.720 --> 36:11.880\n It's like, I'm such a great person and then you're like, are you?\n\n36:11.880 --> 36:16.140\n It's a great, the best way to hide is to pretend to be the opposite of what you are.\n\n36:16.140 --> 36:17.140\n Just like Ted Bundy.\n\n36:17.140 --> 36:18.840\n I'm just an innocent, helpful guy.\n\n36:18.840 --> 36:21.540\n And then boom, next thing you know, you're getting your tit bit off.\n\n36:21.540 --> 36:22.640\n That's really well said.\n\n36:22.640 --> 36:25.820\n It's actually kind of funny because I talk about love a lot.\n\n36:25.820 --> 36:32.180\n And I think the people that kind of look at me with squinty eyes, they wonder like how\n\n36:32.180 --> 36:35.280\n many bodies are in that closet, you know what I mean?\n\n36:35.280 --> 36:40.320\n Like there's something about the duality of like, we're so skeptical as a culture.\n\n36:40.320 --> 36:48.000\n Like if somebody is just like, seems to be kind of, sort of, I don't know, positive and\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.960\n all that kind of, you know, how do I put it?\n\n36:50.960 --> 36:55.320\n Just simple, simple minded in the positivity they express.\n\n36:55.320 --> 36:57.960\n They think like, okay, there's some demons in there.\n\n36:57.960 --> 36:58.960\n Yeah.\n\n36:58.960 --> 37:01.520\n Especially if you're a New Yorker, we don't trust any, the nicer you are, the more skeptical\n\n37:01.520 --> 37:02.520\n we are.\n\n37:02.520 --> 37:03.520\n Yeah.\n\n37:03.520 --> 37:04.520\n I've struggled with that down here.\n\n37:04.520 --> 37:07.480\n And they're like, nah, dude, just, I wanted to show you the best tacos, man.\n\n37:07.480 --> 37:10.040\n And I'm like, did you really, what do you want?\n\n37:10.040 --> 37:13.240\n Because in New York, it's like, if anyone's nice to you, they want something.\n\n37:13.240 --> 37:18.000\n And that's, the pro side to that is it makes you very street smart.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:20.640\n The downside to that is it makes you way too cynical.\n\n37:20.640 --> 37:21.640\n Yeah.\n\n37:21.640 --> 37:26.080\n I've definitely experienced that here in Texas, but people are super, super nice.\n\n37:26.080 --> 37:32.520\n And they're like, do all this cool shit for you and you wonder, what's the angle?\n\n37:32.520 --> 37:33.520\n What are we doing here?\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:35.720\n You mentioned hyenas as your favorite animal.\n\n37:35.720 --> 37:39.760\n I forgot to ask you, what the hell were you thinking?\n\n37:39.760 --> 37:41.640\n Why is a hyena is your favorite animal?\n\n37:41.640 --> 37:42.640\n Yeah.\n\n37:42.640 --> 37:45.560\n It's a fascinating animal.\n\n37:45.560 --> 37:47.080\n Let's look at the whole animal kingdom.\n\n37:47.080 --> 37:52.960\n Like why is it, where do you put, so you like dogs, love my favorite, your favorite is dogs,\n\n37:52.960 --> 37:56.680\n but they're kind of outside the animal kingdom because you're thinking about wolves.\n\n37:56.680 --> 37:59.480\n So the animal kingdom is in nature.\n\n37:59.480 --> 38:00.960\n Dogs escaped nature.\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:02.520\n They kind of did.\n\n38:02.520 --> 38:06.120\n Uh, together with humans, like in a collaborative way, exactly.\n\n38:06.120 --> 38:11.400\n So within nature, within the animal kingdom, what, who's, uh, why not lions?\n\n38:11.400 --> 38:14.320\n Because lions are predictable.\n\n38:14.320 --> 38:16.920\n Lions are just, you know, they're regal and kind of, they bore me.\n\n38:16.920 --> 38:18.180\n It's like the hot chick.\n\n38:18.180 --> 38:19.640\n It's like, we get it.\n\n38:19.640 --> 38:21.640\n You were born the best.\n\n38:21.640 --> 38:22.640\n Yeah.\n\n38:22.640 --> 38:28.240\n You know, I like a scrappy, by any means necessary, intelligent and cunning.\n\n38:28.240 --> 38:30.280\n But aren't they dishonest?\n\n38:30.280 --> 38:31.280\n Yeah.\n\n38:31.280 --> 38:33.440\n And that's why I like them.\n\n38:33.440 --> 38:34.440\n Yes.\n\n38:34.440 --> 38:35.440\n They're dishonest.\n\n38:35.440 --> 38:36.440\n They employ chicanery.\n\n38:36.440 --> 38:42.360\n They, uh, they're, and that's just a sign of how intelligent they are and how self reliant\n\n38:42.360 --> 38:44.720\n they are and how brutal they are.\n\n38:44.720 --> 38:50.120\n Um, they're brutally honest in how much they lie, you know, because it's just, they're\n\n38:50.120 --> 38:52.000\n trying to get the job done.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:55.680\n You know, lions are just like, they're, they're too gifted.\n\n38:55.680 --> 38:59.520\n Everyone hates the fucking, you know, if I went to school with you, I'd be like, of course,\n\n38:59.520 --> 39:00.520\n Lex knows the fucking answer.\n\n39:00.520 --> 39:01.520\n Yeah.\n\n39:01.520 --> 39:02.520\n Lex was born smarter than me.\n\n39:02.520 --> 39:03.520\n Yeah.\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:06.560\n You know, and you'd probably hate me because I was the kid always seeking attention and\n\n39:06.560 --> 39:09.320\n making people, it's like, that's not interesting.\n\n39:09.320 --> 39:12.560\n The guy that claws his way to the top and those are hyenas.\n\n39:12.560 --> 39:16.120\n They're also fascinating just by, uh, merely who they are.\n\n39:16.120 --> 39:19.560\n I mean, they're not related to any other animal.\n\n39:19.560 --> 39:23.520\n They're more closely related to cats than they are dogs, even though they look like\n\n39:23.520 --> 39:24.520\n a dog.\n\n39:24.520 --> 39:25.520\n Yeah.\n\n39:25.520 --> 39:28.760\n They're, but they're very, like very tangentially related even to cats.\n\n39:28.760 --> 39:31.840\n So they're their own kind of thing, which is kind of mysterious.\n\n39:31.840 --> 39:36.440\n I don't think they fully figured out and uh, they, the pseudo penis thing is the, is the,\n\n39:36.440 --> 39:37.440\n I mean,\n\n39:37.440 --> 39:38.440\n Can you explain the pseudo penis?\n\n39:38.440 --> 39:39.440\n Yeah.\n\n39:39.440 --> 39:42.080\n So the, it's a matriarchal society by the way.\n\n39:42.080 --> 39:46.320\n So that's the unique in and of itself that this, we're talking about an apex predator\n\n39:46.320 --> 39:49.980\n that is a matriarchal, much like, uh, you know, the praying mantis.\n\n39:49.980 --> 39:51.380\n It's very rare though.\n\n39:51.380 --> 39:55.920\n And they are fucking brutal and vicious and the women are bigger and they let their cubs\n\n39:55.920 --> 39:59.800\n fight, a lot of fratricide and they do that because they're like, Hey, you're weaker.\n\n39:59.800 --> 40:01.560\n I let your brother kill you.\n\n40:01.560 --> 40:05.760\n And uh, the women have penises, the women have pseudo penises that they give birth out\n\n40:05.760 --> 40:10.600\n of and the birth is violent, but they, they roll around with just huge pieces.\n\n40:10.600 --> 40:15.600\n They're glue guns are just fucking swinging, you know, and the women are just run the show\n\n40:15.600 --> 40:21.800\n and uh, it's just cool that they have these pseudo penises.\n\n40:21.800 --> 40:23.360\n It's almost romantic the way you describe it.\n\n40:23.360 --> 40:25.440\n They have the strongest bite force.\n\n40:25.440 --> 40:26.840\n They they pulverize bone.\n\n40:26.840 --> 40:29.480\n Like when they eat an animal, the animal's gone.\n\n40:29.480 --> 40:30.660\n There's no bones.\n\n40:30.660 --> 40:31.800\n They eat everything.\n\n40:31.800 --> 40:34.480\n They can pulverize their bite is so powerful.\n\n40:34.480 --> 40:36.720\n They pulverize bone and eat it.\n\n40:36.720 --> 40:40.360\n So if they consume an animal, it, the animal was there and then the animal's gone.\n\n40:40.360 --> 40:44.280\n There's no nothing for the vultures there to, uh, to, to, to grab.\n\n40:44.280 --> 40:45.280\n Yeah.\n\n40:45.280 --> 40:50.240\n I'm going to have to revisit the hyenas because my experience with the heinous was from, uh,\n\n40:50.240 --> 40:57.520\n first of all, history is your show, uh, has rebranded them for me, but, uh, the lion king,\n\n40:57.520 --> 41:05.200\n which is, uh, a cartoon, I guess, that, uh, I get emotional at every time I, I hope that\n\n41:05.200 --> 41:09.640\n probably a father issues, every guy probably just, you just have feelings.\n\n41:09.640 --> 41:10.640\n You're a good guy.\n\n41:10.640 --> 41:11.640\n I mean, everyone has feelings.\n\n41:11.640 --> 41:12.640\n Yeah.\n\n41:12.640 --> 41:13.640\n Yeah.\n\n41:13.640 --> 41:14.640\n That one gets everybody.\n\n41:14.640 --> 41:15.640\n I don't know.\n\n41:15.640 --> 41:20.120\n I get, I get every father son movie, like blow with Johnny Depp, uh, and, uh, really\n\n41:20.120 --> 41:21.120\n Yoda.\n\n41:21.120 --> 41:22.120\n Damn.\n\n41:22.120 --> 41:23.120\n That's a good movie.\n\n41:23.120 --> 41:29.560\n And whenever there's like, um, like the disappointment in the father that his son has become like\n\n41:29.560 --> 41:36.040\n this incredibly successful drug lord that then ends up with nothing in, in, in prison,\n\n41:36.040 --> 41:41.120\n uh, just the sadness of them communicating through letters, man, it gets me every time,\n\n41:41.120 --> 41:47.120\n but, but, you know, uh, there, the hyenas are not presented that well in that, um,\n\n41:47.120 --> 41:50.040\n No, they're usually portrayed as like, uh, it's, it's really, it's, it's, it's, it's\n\n41:50.040 --> 41:53.400\n really sad that they're portrayed that way as lions.\n\n41:53.400 --> 41:55.120\n Like lions aren't dicks.\n\n41:55.120 --> 41:56.120\n Lions are dicks.\n\n41:56.120 --> 42:00.900\n They, the, the, the, the alpha lions will kill the cubs of another rival.\n\n42:00.900 --> 42:02.560\n They do all types of dick shit.\n\n42:02.560 --> 42:03.560\n Yeah.\n\n42:03.560 --> 42:06.120\n And, um, yeah, it's, uh, the hyenas are more interesting.\n\n42:06.120 --> 42:10.440\n Like they'll just roll in like a hyena will like, like you said, the lie, you know, cause\n\n42:10.440 --> 42:13.880\n when you watch the Serengeti, you know, animals will hang out with each other.\n\n42:13.880 --> 42:15.320\n They're like by water.\n\n42:15.320 --> 42:20.680\n So one hyena will just kind of roll in and pretend like it's not hungry and then bang.\n\n42:20.680 --> 42:23.840\n They'll use any means necessary to take an animal down.\n\n42:23.840 --> 42:26.760\n Like lions will just use brute strength.\n\n42:26.760 --> 42:31.080\n Hyenas use cunning and you can even go on the internet and find, uh, memes of this where\n\n42:31.080 --> 42:35.820\n hyenas will grab the big animal by the balls and just like, we'll sneak up behind it and\n\n42:35.820 --> 42:37.000\n bite its balls.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:42.040\n And you'll watch an animal 10 size, 10 times the size of the hyena just slowly go down.\n\n42:42.040 --> 42:44.760\n It's brutal, but it's fucking hilarious.\n\n42:44.760 --> 42:51.960\n So I, I think that's, uh, I don't know if you follow the channel, um, nature's metal\n\n42:51.960 --> 42:56.040\n that, that one weighs heavy on me.\n\n42:56.040 --> 43:03.740\n Um, with the hyenas on the balls, I it's tough to, to intellectualize it.\n\n43:03.740 --> 43:11.000\n It's tough to think that the entirety of life on earth has this history of, uh, predators\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:17.240\n being violent, just like just the murder that we come from.\n\n43:17.240 --> 43:18.240\n It's crazy.\n\n43:18.240 --> 43:23.860\n I, it, uh, just like when we're talking about meditating on death, I actually, I keep following\n\n43:23.860 --> 43:28.040\n and unfollowing that Instagram channel because like sometimes it's too much.\n\n43:28.040 --> 43:32.880\n Like I can't, I can't continue with the day after like seeing the brutality, the honest\n\n43:32.880 --> 43:34.880\n brutality of that.\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:36.580\n I don't know how to make sense of it.\n\n43:36.580 --> 43:40.200\n It's important to acknowledge, I think, cause that it's real and we do come from that.\n\n43:40.200 --> 43:42.800\n We are, we evolve from that.\n\n43:42.800 --> 43:43.800\n It's important.\n\n43:43.800 --> 43:44.800\n We still do that.\n\n43:44.800 --> 43:45.800\n We're just hidden from it.\n\n43:45.800 --> 43:48.960\n You know, when you go to the supermarket and get your slab of meat, you know, you're so\n\n43:48.960 --> 43:51.760\n disconnected from where that meat came from.\n\n43:51.760 --> 43:57.460\n It came from that and often that's uglier to watch than because there's some honesty,\n\n43:57.460 --> 44:02.020\n you know, the, the, the, the nature channels only show, uh, that's why we have so much\n\n44:02.020 --> 44:03.380\n sympathy with the prey.\n\n44:03.380 --> 44:06.380\n And this is where I think the same thing with mafia movies, they don't show what the mafia\n\n44:06.380 --> 44:07.380\n really does.\n\n44:07.380 --> 44:08.420\n They glorify the good parts.\n\n44:08.420 --> 44:11.720\n That's why I like state of grace cause it's really just shaking down old people and fucking\n\n44:11.720 --> 44:12.720\n being dicks.\n\n44:12.720 --> 44:16.400\n It's not driving nice cars and being like, you know, so, and, and animal channels do\n\n44:16.400 --> 44:17.400\n the same thing.\n\n44:17.400 --> 44:22.160\n They only show when the cheetah gets it because that's, that's the exciting part.\n\n44:22.160 --> 44:27.840\n But what most people don't know is that those predators strike out almost always a majority\n\n44:27.840 --> 44:30.000\n of the time, the prey wins.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:35.400\n And so if you saw that and put it in context, you might not hate it as much when the predator\n\n44:35.400 --> 44:39.560\n actually gets the little fawn or whatever, because it's so many fawns got away.\n\n44:39.560 --> 44:42.000\n It's so hard to capture your prey.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:46.680\n And you know, we, we don't have the, the, the, they no, no documentary is going to sit\n\n44:46.680 --> 44:51.720\n around and show you the 99 times the cheetah didn't catch.\n\n44:51.720 --> 44:52.720\n Thank you for this perspective.\n\n44:52.720 --> 44:54.000\n It's murder is difficult.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:59.920\n So like this is the, they never talk about for people who murder how difficult that is\n\n44:59.920 --> 45:05.000\n like to trap somebody, to convince them to come back to your place, give it some respect,\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:06.560\n put some respect on Ted Bundy's name.\n\n45:06.560 --> 45:07.560\n Yeah.\n\n45:07.560 --> 45:11.500\n It's not easy to convince somebody to get in your Volkswagen Beagle and, and the cleanup.\n\n45:11.500 --> 45:15.280\n And then you have to kind of plan ahead because you want to keep doing the murder, mass murder.\n\n45:15.280 --> 45:19.240\n You gotta learn how to saw them up, put them in duffel bags, bury, you gotta learn to dig,\n\n45:19.240 --> 45:20.240\n you gotta learn how to hide.\n\n45:20.240 --> 45:21.240\n You gotta learn to lie.\n\n45:21.240 --> 45:25.360\n I mean, it's a lot that goes into it that we need to put a little respect on.\n\n45:25.360 --> 45:26.360\n Yeah.\n\n45:26.360 --> 45:27.360\n Yeah.\n\n45:27.360 --> 45:29.520\n And you have to figure out which tools work the best for the sawing and all those kinds\n\n45:29.520 --> 45:30.520\n of things.\n\n45:30.520 --> 45:33.400\n Um, um, so thank you for the perspective.\n\n45:33.400 --> 45:38.400\n That's what I was hoping we would bring to this table.\n\n45:38.400 --> 45:42.640\n So you, um, uh, you got a little bit Greek in you.\n\n45:42.640 --> 45:50.880\n Uh, one of the episodes on, on a history hyenas, you talked about the battle of Crete where\n\n45:50.880 --> 45:58.800\n the Greeks, your people in, uh, uh, in 19, I guess 41 and the early stages of the world\n\n45:58.800 --> 46:02.640\n war II, there's one of the most epic battles of the war.\n\n46:02.640 --> 46:09.560\n Uh, in fact, in 1941 in a speech made at the Reichstag, Hitler paid tribute to the bravery\n\n46:09.560 --> 46:15.880\n of the Greek saying, it must be said, uh, for the sake of historical truth that amongst\n\n46:15.880 --> 46:22.880\n all our opponents, only the Greeks fought with the endless courage and defiance of death.\n\n46:22.880 --> 46:23.880\n So okay.\n\n46:23.880 --> 46:24.880\n What do you make of this battle?\n\n46:24.880 --> 46:27.220\n What do you make of the spirit of the Greek people?\n\n46:27.220 --> 46:33.080\n This is one of the closest things to me because my mother was actually on the island of Crete\n\n46:33.080 --> 46:35.920\n during this, the first aerial invasion in history.\n\n46:35.920 --> 46:37.320\n A lot of people don't know that.\n\n46:37.320 --> 46:39.400\n So this is a very significant battle.\n\n46:39.400 --> 46:44.800\n Um, first time there was an invasion from the sky, um, and, uh, my mother was a little\n\n46:44.800 --> 46:48.340\n girl and she lived through four years of a Nazi occupation there.\n\n46:48.340 --> 46:51.880\n So my mother was a human rights lawyer and everything, but she just always hated Germans.\n\n46:51.880 --> 46:53.240\n It's just what it is.\n\n46:53.240 --> 46:55.400\n She hated Germans and she never got over it.\n\n46:55.400 --> 46:59.120\n So the most progressive, open minded woman just could not get over this.\n\n46:59.120 --> 47:04.440\n Um, it's a monumental battle that a lot of historians in retrospect have now looked back\n\n47:04.440 --> 47:10.320\n on and said, because the Nazis, first off, you got to take it back to when Hitler instructed\n\n47:10.320 --> 47:11.320\n Mussolini.\n\n47:11.320 --> 47:12.320\n Cause let's be honest, Mussolini was Hitler's bitch.\n\n47:12.320 --> 47:13.320\n You know what I mean?\n\n47:13.320 --> 47:17.480\n It was like, if it, well, you know, if it was fantasy island, Hitler was the fucking\n\n47:17.480 --> 47:19.720\n and the, and Mussolini was boss, the plane.\n\n47:19.720 --> 47:25.260\n Mussolini ever say no to Hitler or even maybe it's always like, yes, yes, yes, we will do\n\n47:25.260 --> 47:26.260\n it.\n\n47:26.260 --> 47:29.320\n And, uh, it's like, yeah, it takes, you have to take Greece.\n\n47:29.320 --> 47:37.160\n And so, um, yeah, so Italy being much bigger than Greece, Greece is a tiny country, nine,\n\n47:37.160 --> 47:38.160\n 10 million.\n\n47:38.160 --> 47:45.080\n So Italy invaded Greece, um, you know, um, and Aukey day's a big, it's a big holiday\n\n47:45.080 --> 47:46.080\n for Greeks.\n\n47:46.080 --> 47:52.960\n And this speaks to the spirit Greeks in fight until we have a common enemy and then we unite,\n\n47:52.960 --> 47:58.440\n you see it throughout history, Sparta and Athens, you see it in Greek families where\n\n47:58.440 --> 47:59.440\n the brothers will fight.\n\n47:59.440 --> 48:03.940\n But then as soon as we have a common enemy, we unite and maybe it's an overactive brain.\n\n48:03.940 --> 48:07.720\n We think too much, our traditions, philosophy, and we overthink things and we fight with\n\n48:07.720 --> 48:10.880\n each other and take things personally, we're ultra passionate.\n\n48:10.880 --> 48:17.040\n But when Italy said, Hey, we're going to move troops through, you know, uh, a Greek said\n\n48:17.040 --> 48:23.320\n Aukey, which means no, and that was, um, and then Italy attacked and, uh, we beat the shit\n\n48:23.320 --> 48:24.320\n out of them.\n\n48:24.320 --> 48:28.600\n A much bigger country, much, uh, more well equipped country.\n\n48:28.600 --> 48:32.680\n Greece beat the shit of them, kicked them back into Albania, actually not only repelled\n\n48:32.680 --> 48:36.520\n them, actually like conquered some ground in Albania, pushed them back.\n\n48:36.520 --> 48:41.400\n And then Hitler was like, fuck, you know, I was planning my March to Russia, uh, but\n\n48:41.400 --> 48:45.120\n I have to go down because he basically said to Mussolini, like, you know, you're basically\n\n48:45.120 --> 48:46.120\n bitch slapped.\n\n48:46.120 --> 48:49.400\n I'm like, I got to do this myself because you're such a fucking bitch.\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:51.160\n So then the Nazis invaded Greece.\n\n48:51.160 --> 48:54.080\n Obviously they took the mainland with fight and shot out.\n\n48:54.080 --> 48:57.200\n The Greeks never give credit to the British and New Zealand and Australian troops that\n\n48:57.200 --> 48:58.200\n were there.\n\n48:58.200 --> 49:03.040\n You know, they were a large part of this, the majority of it, but the Greeks fight dude,\n\n49:03.040 --> 49:04.040\n civilians.\n\n49:04.040 --> 49:07.680\n I mean, they fought, you know, the Ottomans were there 400 years.\n\n49:07.680 --> 49:08.680\n You go to Greece.\n\n49:08.680 --> 49:09.680\n Now there's no evidence.\n\n49:09.680 --> 49:13.640\n There's virtually no evidence of them ever being there.\n\n49:13.640 --> 49:14.800\n That's the Greek spirit.\n\n49:14.800 --> 49:17.320\n Kick them out and we kicked out hummus too.\n\n49:17.320 --> 49:18.960\n So it's like their culture's gone.\n\n49:18.960 --> 49:19.960\n You're gone.\n\n49:19.960 --> 49:21.960\n Cause Greeks are, uh, it's philoptimo.\n\n49:21.960 --> 49:22.960\n It's called philoptimo.\n\n49:22.960 --> 49:23.960\n And it's a real thing.\n\n49:23.960 --> 49:26.440\n Philoptimo is a, it's very little translate.\n\n49:26.440 --> 49:33.000\n You can't translate it, but it's kind of like honor, loyalty, friendship, uh, altruism.\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:36.520\n It's a, it's, you can't define it, but Greeks know it and we're taught it from our, from\n\n49:36.520 --> 49:38.700\n our, uh, families.\n\n49:38.700 --> 49:39.700\n It's a vibe, man.\n\n49:39.700 --> 49:43.760\n It's a Greek cultural thing and we're an old culture and philoptimo is what it's called\n\n49:43.760 --> 49:44.920\n philoptimo.\n\n49:44.920 --> 49:50.440\n And it's, um, it's love, it's passion and it comes out and it comes out.\n\n49:50.440 --> 49:57.300\n And so, um, so Hitler had to postpone his invasion of, um, of, uh, Russia went down\n\n49:57.300 --> 50:01.060\n the island of Crete took 10 days to conquer.\n\n50:01.060 --> 50:07.200\n It's an island to put that in perspective, the country of France fell in three or four\n\n50:07.200 --> 50:08.200\n days.\n\n50:08.200 --> 50:09.340\n I can't even remember cause they fucking just rolled over.\n\n50:09.340 --> 50:10.340\n So what is it?\n\n50:10.340 --> 50:13.400\n What does a couple of hours matter when you're that much of a fucking pussy?\n\n50:13.400 --> 50:14.400\n Okay.\n\n50:14.400 --> 50:19.480\n What is a couple out in 12 hour fucking three or four days, the island of Crete took the\n\n50:19.480 --> 50:22.300\n Germans 10 days to conquer.\n\n50:22.300 --> 50:28.100\n And because of that, and because of the Greek resistance, Hitler had to postpone his invasion\n\n50:28.100 --> 50:29.760\n of Russia to winter.\n\n50:29.760 --> 50:34.360\n And of course that was, you know, that was his downfall just as it was Napoleon's and\n\n50:34.360 --> 50:37.060\n a never dude, never try to invade Russia.\n\n50:37.060 --> 50:39.020\n They got millions of people to throw at death.\n\n50:39.020 --> 50:42.200\n Every time you read about Russians in history books, like, and a million died.\n\n50:42.200 --> 50:46.300\n I mean, it's like, you just guys throw millions of people at the problem and don't fuck with\n\n50:46.300 --> 50:50.100\n that Russian winter and don't fuck with Russian people, dude, they're tough.\n\n50:50.100 --> 50:53.500\n People in New York know that you don't go to fucking sheep set bay and start talking\n\n50:53.500 --> 50:54.500\n shit.\n\n50:54.500 --> 50:56.620\n You'll end up in a fucking car trunk and they'll brutally murder you.\n\n50:56.620 --> 50:58.620\n I do not fuck with Russians.\n\n50:58.620 --> 50:59.620\n Amen.\n\n50:59.620 --> 51:03.180\n And then there's a, I mean, there's a lot of people, a lot of historians argue that\n\n51:03.180 --> 51:07.740\n that battle was because of the Russian winter because of delaying the Russian invasion,\n\n51:07.740 --> 51:10.380\n but also psychologically delaying the invasion.\n\n51:10.380 --> 51:17.020\n It was the first time, I think it was the first time the Germans failed, not, or didn't\n\n51:17.020 --> 51:23.120\n succeed like they wanted to early in the war, which is a little like psychologically the\n\n51:23.120 --> 51:26.700\n impact of that I think is immeasurable.\n\n51:26.700 --> 51:33.220\n And also a lot of people argue from a military strategy perspective that the, just like you\n\n51:33.220 --> 51:39.800\n said, it was an aerial attack and that Hitler didn't think that the, that kind of attack\n\n51:39.800 --> 51:42.300\n would then be useful for the rest of the war.\n\n51:42.300 --> 51:47.380\n So that's, that's a really part where, whereas it might've been very useful.\n\n51:47.380 --> 51:51.700\n So it's a, it's really interesting how these little battles can steer the directions of\n\n51:51.700 --> 51:52.700\n war.\n\n51:52.700 --> 51:57.780\n Of course, me growing up in the Soviet Union, we didn't hear much about this battle.\n\n51:57.780 --> 52:00.020\n Just like you said, millions of Soviets died.\n\n52:00.020 --> 52:03.900\n All those people in history that you read about dying, those are all civilians, but\n\n52:03.900 --> 52:08.860\n I mean, not all, but a very large number of them are civilians and their stories, obviously\n\n52:08.860 --> 52:15.060\n that's the rooted, the literature, the poetry, the music, just the way people talk, the way\n\n52:15.060 --> 52:20.360\n they drink vodka, the way they love, the way they hate, the way they fear.\n\n52:20.360 --> 52:24.260\n That's all like rooted in World War II and World War I.\n\n52:24.260 --> 52:32.020\n And so, but we never kind of think about Europe and we certainly, growing up, didn't think\n\n52:32.020 --> 52:34.220\n about their role in the United States.\n\n52:34.220 --> 52:39.220\n All this, there's plenty of stories of heroism in the Soviet Union, enough to, enough for\n\n52:39.220 --> 52:40.220\n many lifetimes.\n\n52:40.220 --> 52:45.580\n So, but it was fascinating to read from a Greek perspective, cause I, you know, I don't\n\n52:45.580 --> 52:50.860\n have many Greek friends, I hope you didn't change that.\n\n52:50.860 --> 52:54.540\n This is the beginning of a love affair of your people.\n\n52:54.540 --> 52:55.540\n Yeah.\n\n52:55.540 --> 52:59.620\n But likewise, the Americans don't hear about the Soviet contribution to the end of World\n\n52:59.620 --> 53:04.820\n War II because obviously we became, you know, enemies after that because of the two systems.\n\n53:04.820 --> 53:08.500\n But yeah, without the Russians, World War II wouldn't have been won either.\n\n53:08.500 --> 53:09.500\n Yeah.\n\n53:09.500 --> 53:10.500\n The stories are written by the victors.\n\n53:10.500 --> 53:11.500\n That's really interesting.\n\n53:11.500 --> 53:16.420\n I, just looking at the, at history, you wonder what's missing.\n\n53:16.420 --> 53:21.020\n I'll tell you what's missing that I know for a fact, cause my dad told, my dad told me\n\n53:21.020 --> 53:23.740\n combat's hell and he would tell me the reality of what it's really like.\n\n53:23.740 --> 53:28.020\n Guys pissing themselves, calling for their mother, the fog of war, obviously, fratricide\n\n53:28.020 --> 53:29.020\n happens all the time.\n\n53:29.020 --> 53:30.020\n It's pandemonium.\n\n53:30.020 --> 53:33.900\n I mean, there's skill involved, but I mean, there's no, like it's a lot of it is just\n\n53:33.900 --> 53:34.900\n luck.\n\n53:34.900 --> 53:39.020\n My dad said, he, my dad won three, he got, you know, medals, braille, purple hearts,\n\n53:39.020 --> 53:40.020\n all that shit.\n\n53:40.020 --> 53:42.300\n And he said, the reason was, is cause you can't, he always said, this is another thing.\n\n53:42.300 --> 53:44.940\n He told me, you can't pin a medal on a dead guy.\n\n53:44.940 --> 53:47.940\n So it's like, those are the guys who deserve it, but you can't pin a medal.\n\n53:47.940 --> 53:55.020\n You can't do the pomp and, and I'll tell you one thing is that it is written by the victors\n\n53:55.020 --> 53:57.500\n and all these leaders, they say we're in the front.\n\n53:57.500 --> 53:58.900\n We're not in the front.\n\n53:58.900 --> 53:59.900\n We're not in the front.\n\n53:59.900 --> 54:02.260\n Whenever the history books say he led his troops into battle.\n\n54:02.260 --> 54:06.100\n It's like, did he really, did he, so then how did he live?\n\n54:06.100 --> 54:09.380\n Cause they put like kids in the front, you know, it's like nobody limps back from the\n\n54:09.380 --> 54:15.980\n front with like a injury, you know, that's, that's army PR, you know, whenever you read,\n\n54:15.980 --> 54:20.140\n you know, 27 soldiers died, 14 were injured.\n\n54:20.140 --> 54:21.940\n The word injured is PR.\n\n54:21.940 --> 54:22.940\n That's like injured.\n\n54:22.940 --> 54:25.100\n Was he, did he sprain his ankle?\n\n54:25.100 --> 54:28.860\n Did he need, did he get carried off the court or, you know, he was maimed.\n\n54:28.860 --> 54:34.300\n I mean, he was like, his leg was blown off, you know, it's like, so, uh, I think that,\n\n54:34.300 --> 54:37.180\n you know, Alexander the Great was just kind of in the back on his horse and just kind\n\n54:37.180 --> 54:40.940\n of, he had his eunuch blow him a few times and he was like, is it bad up there?\n\n54:40.940 --> 54:43.940\n And then like after that he was like, okay, my scribe, give me my scribe.\n\n54:43.940 --> 54:44.940\n Okay.\n\n54:44.940 --> 54:46.180\n When you write this down, can you put me in the front?\n\n54:46.180 --> 54:47.180\n Yeah.\n\n54:47.180 --> 54:50.660\n And I was just making me a big hero and I was in there and then he, you know, he just\n\n54:50.660 --> 54:54.460\n blew his, you know, he had sex with his eunuch and rode off into the sunset because there's\n\n54:54.460 --> 54:57.220\n just no way you survive in the front, especially warfare back then.\n\n54:57.220 --> 54:59.140\n I mean, it's like brutal.\n\n54:59.140 --> 55:02.820\n Then again, you have like, uh, Genghis Khan.\n\n55:02.820 --> 55:07.340\n The sense I got that he was a little bit up on the front, at least the first.\n\n55:07.340 --> 55:08.340\n Yeah.\n\n55:08.340 --> 55:09.340\n Or is that also, is he a little bit Alexander the Great?\n\n55:09.340 --> 55:10.340\n Give me my scribe.\n\n55:10.340 --> 55:11.340\n Yeah.\n\n55:11.340 --> 55:12.340\n It's all lore.\n\n55:12.340 --> 55:13.880\n I mean, you ever play the game of telephone?\n\n55:13.880 --> 55:16.900\n You know, it's like, you know, there's no video cameras back then.\n\n55:16.900 --> 55:21.700\n So shit just get, turns into myth, you know, and, uh, there's no way he was in the front.\n\n55:21.700 --> 55:23.660\n There's no way he wouldn't have lived.\n\n55:23.660 --> 55:28.540\n You know, he was probably good on horseback cause those, those dudes were good on horseback.\n\n55:28.540 --> 55:30.220\n But it was like game of Thrones back then.\n\n55:30.220 --> 55:33.780\n You had all these different people and they kind of, yeah, the, the, the Mongols were\n\n55:33.780 --> 55:34.780\n wild dude.\n\n55:34.780 --> 55:39.020\n They are actually said like, um, they started like they were more adaptable to the horse\n\n55:39.020 --> 55:43.340\n because they were so good on horseback that kids started to be born like kind of bow legged\n\n55:43.340 --> 55:44.500\n like to fit the horse.\n\n55:44.500 --> 55:45.500\n It's wild.\n\n55:45.500 --> 55:47.620\n And they would stretch their heads and shit like that.\n\n55:47.620 --> 55:49.020\n They wrap them and stretch their heads.\n\n55:49.020 --> 55:56.100\n So they find like Mongol skulls and they look like cone heads and they were brutal and vicious\n\n55:56.100 --> 56:00.740\n and they would maraud and rape and all the fun stuff that, you know, when, you know,\n\n56:00.740 --> 56:04.300\n when you visit other places back then, there's no tchotchke stops and souvenir shops.\n\n56:04.300 --> 56:08.580\n What you do is you take women and those are the tokens, you know, you burn a few huts\n\n56:08.580 --> 56:10.340\n different.\n\n56:10.340 --> 56:11.980\n Tourism was different back then.\n\n56:11.980 --> 56:12.980\n Yeah.\n\n56:12.980 --> 56:15.940\n That's another difficult thing.\n\n56:15.940 --> 56:21.060\n So we're talking about nature and predators to think about the long stretch of history\n\n56:21.060 --> 56:28.780\n where we're just murder and we made so much progress, I guess, in the past couple of centuries.\n\n56:28.780 --> 56:31.380\n The United States is a shining example of that.\n\n56:31.380 --> 56:35.740\n But do you think also that it's that effect that we were, a lot of good things had to\n\n56:35.740 --> 56:37.980\n happen too or else we wouldn't be here.\n\n56:37.980 --> 56:42.780\n So do we just focus, isn't it like a car crash effect that like we're, you know, the rubber\n\n56:42.780 --> 56:46.300\n neck that everyone pulls over to see a car crash, are we just only focusing on the negative\n\n56:46.300 --> 56:48.660\n things of history because they're just more exciting to us?\n\n56:48.660 --> 56:51.420\n Like it's just not, it's boring to be like, yeah, and then there was a bunch of villagers\n\n56:51.420 --> 56:55.020\n and they ate every day and danced and loved.\n\n56:55.020 --> 56:56.020\n Yeah.\n\n56:56.020 --> 57:01.740\n I wonder, I wonder how different those people were, you know, like they might've had the\n\n57:01.740 --> 57:09.580\n same exact loves and fears and like they perhaps had the same kind of brilliant ideas in their\n\n57:09.580 --> 57:11.220\n head, if not more brilliant.\n\n57:11.220 --> 57:16.300\n And we kind of think about like this moment in history is like the most special moment.\n\n57:16.300 --> 57:20.420\n Like we're doing the coolest shit that we're doing the most amazing building and most amazing\n\n57:20.420 --> 57:21.420\n things.\n\n57:21.420 --> 57:25.620\n But maybe they were building amazing things in their different way with like less technological,\n\n57:25.620 --> 57:30.260\n but in the space of ideas, in the space of just all the different, the camaraderie and\n\n57:30.260 --> 57:35.260\n the space of like concepts, mathematics, all those kinds of things.\n\n57:35.260 --> 57:36.260\n Yeah.\n\n57:36.260 --> 57:37.940\n I mean, Greece, you look at the architecture, it still stands up.\n\n57:37.940 --> 57:42.780\n I mean, all the government, but it's still arguably, I mean, as far as objective beauty,\n\n57:42.780 --> 57:47.060\n it's hard to argue that Greco Roman, it's just something about it with the, with the\n\n57:47.060 --> 57:48.060\n columns.\n\n57:48.060 --> 57:50.420\n It's just, it's powerful.\n\n57:50.420 --> 57:54.340\n It's I don't know, even Ayn Rand would probably appreciate it.\n\n57:54.340 --> 57:59.220\n She doesn't, no, no, no.\n\n57:59.220 --> 58:04.380\n So in your history, hyenas that unfortunately has come to an end, we're talking about empires\n\n58:04.380 --> 58:08.340\n coming to an end, all empires fall.\n\n58:08.340 --> 58:11.620\n That one, it may rise again.\n\n58:11.620 --> 58:12.620\n Empires might rise again.\n\n58:12.620 --> 58:13.620\n Who knows?\n\n58:13.620 --> 58:14.620\n Who knows?\n\n58:14.620 --> 58:20.580\n I, I'm obviously a fan, so I hope it does rise again, but you've seemed to develop your\n\n58:20.580 --> 58:22.500\n own language.\n\n58:22.500 --> 58:26.580\n Can you, you know, it's what it is.\n\n58:26.580 --> 58:28.500\n What is, what is that?\n\n58:28.500 --> 58:34.220\n What the hell, is this some kind of medical condition or can you, can you explain like\n\n58:34.220 --> 58:39.900\n the linguistic essentials that catch us up to the linguistic essentials that people need\n\n58:39.900 --> 58:43.060\n to know to understand the way you speak?\n\n58:43.060 --> 58:47.900\n You know, Leopold and Loeb, you know the story of those two, they murdered that kid and they\n\n58:47.900 --> 58:48.900\n had this weird relationship.\n\n58:48.900 --> 58:53.760\n Anyway, it's an interesting thing to Google, Leopold and Loeb, these two guys who ended\n\n58:53.760 --> 58:57.380\n up murdering a kid because they developed their own language with each other and this\n\n58:57.380 --> 59:00.860\n own reality and this weird thing and they wanted to know what it's like to murder a\n\n59:00.860 --> 59:01.860\n kid and they murder a kid.\n\n59:01.860 --> 59:07.340\n It's a famous story in American lore and history or whatever, famous case.\n\n59:07.340 --> 59:10.460\n But this phenomenon, yeah, me and Chris got together.\n\n59:10.460 --> 59:15.580\n It wasn't as dark as Leopold and Loeb, we didn't murder a kid, but we murdered a podcast.\n\n59:15.580 --> 59:18.980\n Or at least stabbed it a few times.\n\n59:18.980 --> 59:24.360\n Yeah, it's, it was something in the organic chemistry of me and Chris that I think we'll\n\n59:24.360 --> 59:31.940\n both end up appreciating even probably more than we do now that it's mysterious.\n\n59:31.940 --> 59:39.900\n I got to be honest with you, it's, it was a thing that it wasn't conscious, wasn't intentional.\n\n59:39.900 --> 59:45.860\n It was something that happened in the music of our energies that just went.\n\n59:45.860 --> 59:50.020\n Like when you hear someone sing or when a jazz band hits a rhythm or even when I'm on\n\n59:50.020 --> 59:54.180\n stage and I just catch a rhythm, it's like, dude, I didn't make a choice there.\n\n59:54.180 --> 59:55.180\n I don't know what that is.\n\n59:55.180 --> 1:00:00.020\n I don't know how to explain it, but it comes from somewhere else and I don't know what\n\n1:00:00.020 --> 1:00:01.020\n it is.\n\n1:00:01.020 --> 1:00:02.020\n It's beyond my comprehension.\n\n1:00:02.020 --> 1:00:07.900\n But with Chris, there was this magical chemistry that, you know, I have chemistry with a lot\n\n1:00:07.900 --> 1:00:11.540\n of people and it can be funny and I feel zero chemistry here.\n\n1:00:11.540 --> 1:00:12.540\n This is great.\n\n1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:13.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:13.540 --> 1:00:17.100\n It's a little bit more intelligent than what me and Chris did.\n\n1:00:17.100 --> 1:00:21.660\n But you know, me and Chris, I think we connected on the funny bone.\n\n1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:26.900\n Like I, he, I found him so funny and we found the same things funny.\n\n1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:33.360\n And from that, these organic expressions came from some part of our brains that was created\n\n1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:34.360\n from this chemistry.\n\n1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:38.520\n And yeah, we just developed this language and this cult following and people were really\n\n1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:40.260\n upset when we ended.\n\n1:00:40.260 --> 1:00:44.380\n But it was the right thing to end because like all things that end, it was kind of done\n\n1:00:44.380 --> 1:00:46.540\n a few episodes even before we finished.\n\n1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:52.380\n And I think we pulled the plug before it started rolling downhill, like all, you know, like\n\n1:00:52.380 --> 1:00:59.100\n all great flings, you know, there's your long relation, long marriages are boring and comfortable.\n\n1:00:59.100 --> 1:01:05.540\n The one you really like fucking always ends abruptly and sadly and, but you always look\n\n1:01:05.540 --> 1:01:07.540\n back and you jerk off to it.\n\n1:01:07.540 --> 1:01:10.580\n And so you guys made love and we made, yeah.\n\n1:01:10.580 --> 1:01:16.100\n So it's like, it was like a hot fling with me and him and it was intense and we burned\n\n1:01:16.100 --> 1:01:17.940\n the candle at both ends.\n\n1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:24.060\n And it was, I think that podcast was meant to be three years and maybe people will go\n\n1:01:24.060 --> 1:01:27.140\n back and appreciate it and listen to it over and over again.\n\n1:01:27.140 --> 1:01:31.460\n And I think the new things we do, people will love, I'm doing long days now, that podcast\n\n1:01:31.460 --> 1:01:32.460\n and people seem to enjoy it.\n\n1:01:32.460 --> 1:01:35.180\n I've been really enjoying the long days on YouTube.\n\n1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:41.500\n I just found myself just like staring at you ranting for, same with Tim Dillon, I really\n\n1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:45.660\n enjoyed the, whatever those rants are, the genius of just one thing after the other.\n\n1:01:45.660 --> 1:01:50.860\n But definitely the chemistry, almost as a study, I remember the reason I first started\n\n1:01:50.860 --> 1:01:57.540\n listening to it, I was trying to get a perspective on certain historical moments.\n\n1:01:57.540 --> 1:01:58.540\n Like it was interesting.\n\n1:01:58.540 --> 1:02:00.420\n I tuned in to learn history.\n\n1:02:00.420 --> 1:02:01.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:08.820\n I came for the history and like stayed for the chaos and the crack open and clean out.\n\n1:02:08.820 --> 1:02:14.620\n And yeah, this, it was almost, I listened to Rogan like this sometimes.\n\n1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:23.940\n I'll relisten to an episode to try to understand why was this so fun to listen to?\n\n1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:26.420\n It's almost like trying to analyze humor or something like that.\n\n1:02:26.420 --> 1:02:32.860\n But it's nice from a conversational perspective, like why was this so easy to listen to?\n\n1:02:32.860 --> 1:02:37.060\n And with History of Hyenas, like why is the chemistry so good?\n\n1:02:37.060 --> 1:02:39.300\n It's so, it's weird.\n\n1:02:39.300 --> 1:02:40.300\n It's weird.\n\n1:02:40.300 --> 1:02:44.300\n Cause there's not many podcasts like, I don't know any with the chemistry like that.\n\n1:02:44.300 --> 1:02:45.300\n It's interesting.\n\n1:02:45.300 --> 1:02:54.300\n And it's kind of sad that the fling with a prostitute in Vegas has to end, you know?\n\n1:02:54.300 --> 1:02:55.300\n But that's what makes it special.\n\n1:02:55.300 --> 1:02:58.340\n It's the Bukowski thing with the fog.\n\n1:02:58.340 --> 1:03:03.260\n The British Office, one of my favorite shows was that it ended very quick.\n\n1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:05.940\n It's only a couple of seasons or something like that.\n\n1:03:05.940 --> 1:03:09.800\n And that was tragic, but that took guts to just end it.\n\n1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:13.260\n Given all the money you could have made, given all the, you just end it.\n\n1:03:13.260 --> 1:03:14.980\n And that's what makes it truly special.\n\n1:03:14.980 --> 1:03:15.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:15.980 --> 1:03:17.380\n And I'll tell you, man, I'll just emphasize it.\n\n1:03:17.380 --> 1:03:19.980\n Cause I marvel at it too.\n\n1:03:19.980 --> 1:03:24.940\n Cause as a guy who tries to always figure out what the causes of things, I gotta be\n\n1:03:24.940 --> 1:03:25.940\n honest, man.\n\n1:03:25.940 --> 1:03:29.580\n Looking back on that, even with retrospective wisdom, you know, that 2020 hindsight, we've\n\n1:03:29.580 --> 1:03:35.620\n been done a couple of months now, it's something that I can't explain.\n\n1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:38.000\n It's something that I don't know how you quantify it.\n\n1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.620\n I don't know how you describe it.\n\n1:03:40.620 --> 1:03:41.620\n It's musical.\n\n1:03:41.620 --> 1:03:44.580\n It's really kind of rhythmic.\n\n1:03:44.580 --> 1:03:48.580\n Maybe like a Netflix show about history.\n\n1:03:48.580 --> 1:03:52.620\n That's in the future with the two of you.\n\n1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:59.220\n You guys will meet like the way you meet with a fling like a decade from now at a diner\n\n1:03:59.220 --> 1:04:05.780\n and you're both way fatter and uglier and then you just reminisce over some cigarettes\n\n1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:06.780\n and coffee.\n\n1:04:06.780 --> 1:04:07.780\n It could be.\n\n1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:08.780\n Yeah, it could be.\n\n1:04:08.780 --> 1:04:09.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:09.780 --> 1:04:13.220\n It's definitely a classic podcast that people can go back and appreciate.\n\n1:04:13.220 --> 1:04:16.060\n It's fast paced and it was unique.\n\n1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:21.140\n What was it like to research for, I mean, it was really scholarly, the depth of research\n\n1:04:21.140 --> 1:04:23.000\n that you performed.\n\n1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:29.780\n It sometimes felt like you almost read an entire Wikipedia article beforehand.\n\n1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:30.780\n Or like.\n\n1:04:30.780 --> 1:04:31.780\n Exactly true.\n\n1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:38.340\n We were, we were one fan, we attracted such funny people to that podcast and the fans\n\n1:04:38.340 --> 1:04:43.300\n were so funny and one fan called us nicknamed as Wikipedia sluts.\n\n1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:44.420\n And so it just stuck.\n\n1:04:44.420 --> 1:04:45.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:45.420 --> 1:04:46.420\n We just would read Wikipedia.\n\n1:04:46.420 --> 1:04:48.860\n I would do a lot more research than Chris.\n\n1:04:48.860 --> 1:04:52.580\n And so I would actually, you know, once in a while he'd get into it too.\n\n1:04:52.580 --> 1:04:58.300\n But for very interesting episodes, I got some subject matter would just pull me in.\n\n1:04:58.300 --> 1:05:01.500\n Like Bernie Madoff, just to think of one that was recent, it was one of our last ones.\n\n1:05:01.500 --> 1:05:06.260\n And I think one of our better episodes and I'm glad that it kind of ended after that\n\n1:05:06.260 --> 1:05:09.860\n because it was rare to, I think we started to slip a little bit.\n\n1:05:09.860 --> 1:05:13.980\n I got fascinated and I got, I did a lot of research for Bernie Madoff, but usually, yeah,\n\n1:05:13.980 --> 1:05:15.580\n we'd pull up Wikipedia and we'd have fun.\n\n1:05:15.580 --> 1:05:17.900\n We were sort of the antithesis of Dan Carlin.\n\n1:05:17.900 --> 1:05:24.220\n I mean, you went to Dan Carlin for accuracy and thoughtfulness and you went to us for,\n\n1:05:24.220 --> 1:05:26.220\n it was a hang with history.\n\n1:05:26.220 --> 1:05:30.500\n That's why history hyenas was such an appropriate name because it was, it was a little bit of\n\n1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:31.500\n history.\n\n1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:35.500\n Some, some episodes were more hyena, more wild and a little history and some were a\n\n1:05:35.500 --> 1:05:38.220\n little more dense, like the battle of Crete and less hyena.\n\n1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:41.860\n So you were, you were always going to get both, you're either going to get a majority\n\n1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:42.860\n of one or the other.\n\n1:05:42.860 --> 1:05:43.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:43.860 --> 1:05:44.860\n And Dan Carlin is the lion, I guess.\n\n1:05:44.860 --> 1:05:45.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:45.860 --> 1:05:48.260\n And you guys, predictably good.\n\n1:05:48.260 --> 1:05:49.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:49.260 --> 1:05:53.340\n I mean, what, what are your thoughts about, I mean, he's a storyteller too.\n\n1:05:53.340 --> 1:05:57.220\n He gets a lot of criticism for the, from the historians, quote unquote.\n\n1:05:57.220 --> 1:05:59.060\n That's why he likes to knock.\n\n1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:04.500\n He keeps saying he's not a historian, but what's your, what are your thoughts about\n\n1:06:04.500 --> 1:06:06.180\n the hardcore history with Dan Carlin?\n\n1:06:06.180 --> 1:06:15.060\n Like, was he an inspiration to the podcast you were doing or, or like an account, like\n\n1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:20.140\n a, almost like a reverse psychology inspiration where you wanted to do some kind of opposing\n\n1:06:20.140 --> 1:06:27.700\n type of podcast in history or was history always just like a, a launching pad to just\n\n1:06:27.700 --> 1:06:29.940\n talk shit about human nature?\n\n1:06:29.940 --> 1:06:31.020\n More of the latter.\n\n1:06:31.020 --> 1:06:33.420\n I wasn't even aware of his podcast when we started.\n\n1:06:33.420 --> 1:06:34.420\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:06:34.420 --> 1:06:35.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:35.420 --> 1:06:39.020\n And so we, it was just very organic, again, like the chemistry, me and Chris became very\n\n1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:40.220\n good friends.\n\n1:06:40.220 --> 1:06:41.900\n We started the podcast.\n\n1:06:41.900 --> 1:06:45.820\n First we did a web series called Bay Ridge Boys, which has its sort of little cult following.\n\n1:06:45.820 --> 1:06:48.300\n We did like five episodes and ended it.\n\n1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:53.260\n And then we did the podcast and hi, hyenas were my favorite animal and I talk about them\n\n1:06:53.260 --> 1:06:57.060\n passionately and I told Chris about them and then he started appreciating them and we both\n\n1:06:57.060 --> 1:06:58.060\n love history.\n\n1:06:58.060 --> 1:06:59.060\n I majored in history.\n\n1:06:59.060 --> 1:07:00.060\n It's one of the things I love.\n\n1:07:00.060 --> 1:07:01.060\n I go to museums all the time.\n\n1:07:01.060 --> 1:07:03.420\n I go to his, I do history tours, so does he.\n\n1:07:03.420 --> 1:07:07.540\n And so it was just sort of a natural, let's do a history podcast and it gave us something\n\n1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:12.740\n to talk about each episode to sort of lean our, you know, hang our hats on and, and riff\n\n1:07:12.740 --> 1:07:13.900\n off of.\n\n1:07:13.900 --> 1:07:15.500\n So it had nothing to do with dance.\n\n1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:17.380\n What I think about dance, I think it's great.\n\n1:07:17.380 --> 1:07:24.700\n I think even if he's inaccurate in the opinions of the historical community, it starts conversations,\n\n1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:25.780\n which is good.\n\n1:07:25.780 --> 1:07:28.460\n It's like this thing where people go, oh, it's dangerous rhetoric.\n\n1:07:28.460 --> 1:07:32.500\n It's like, no, rhetoric only becomes dangerous when education fails.\n\n1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:35.500\n What's going on in America is education has failed.\n\n1:07:35.500 --> 1:07:39.460\n So if you call someone online dangerous, it's not him that's dangerous.\n\n1:07:39.460 --> 1:07:41.700\n It's the fucking stupid people that's dangerous.\n\n1:07:41.700 --> 1:07:42.700\n And it's the fault of this country.\n\n1:07:42.700 --> 1:07:44.320\n We didn't listen to Aristotle.\n\n1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:50.060\n The future of a civilization depends on public education and we failed.\n\n1:07:50.060 --> 1:07:51.060\n Education has failed.\n\n1:07:51.060 --> 1:07:53.140\n Kids are, kids are not interested in shit.\n\n1:07:53.140 --> 1:07:59.980\n And so in some sense, those dance podcasts and podcasts can be incredibly educational.\n\n1:07:59.980 --> 1:08:07.740\n Because he's a, the storytelling that pulls you in ultimately leads to you internalizing\n\n1:08:07.740 --> 1:08:11.620\n these stories and like remembering them and thinking through them and all those kinds\n\n1:08:11.620 --> 1:08:15.180\n of things that is much more powerful than you book on history.\n\n1:08:15.180 --> 1:08:16.180\n That's accurate.\n\n1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:18.740\n I think often it inspires you to go learn more.\n\n1:08:18.740 --> 1:08:19.740\n So it's like, I know we did that.\n\n1:08:19.740 --> 1:08:23.060\n I mean, you know, I, people would go, Hey, I went and learned about this because they\n\n1:08:23.060 --> 1:08:27.340\n knew with us, there was no pretense, which was great that we had no standard.\n\n1:08:27.340 --> 1:08:32.220\n So it's like, nobody came to us for historical accuracy, but I was kind of turned on by the\n\n1:08:32.220 --> 1:08:37.660\n fact that it inspired people to go learn about this stuff or to at least know like Battle\n\n1:08:37.660 --> 1:08:42.100\n of Crete, like you said, a very underappreciated battle.\n\n1:08:42.100 --> 1:08:47.980\n Even Winston Churchill said from here on, we will no longer say that Greeks fight like\n\n1:08:47.980 --> 1:08:49.580\n heroes, but heroes fight like Greeks.\n\n1:08:49.580 --> 1:08:54.660\n I mean, it was a monumental battle and you know, not talked about enough.\n\n1:08:54.660 --> 1:09:00.300\n And I, our podcast would inspire people to go actually learn more, to go listen to Dan\n\n1:09:00.300 --> 1:09:04.020\n Carlin or to go pick up a book or to do research on their own.\n\n1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:10.060\n And so I think podcasts, Dan Carlin's obviously much more accurate than us, but it's good\n\n1:09:10.060 --> 1:09:13.460\n that people are going to podcasts like yours and to learn shit.\n\n1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:16.860\n Joe was, is really like the progenitor of that.\n\n1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:22.360\n I mean, you know, having intellectuals on and getting the public interested with this\n\n1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:27.420\n new medium in, in people who are intelligent.\n\n1:09:27.420 --> 1:09:28.420\n It's nice.\n\n1:09:28.420 --> 1:09:33.820\n Cause you know, what the mainstream press pushes out is horseshit, gorgeous horseshit.\n\n1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:37.300\n It's got a beautiful veneer, but no substance.\n\n1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:39.460\n And so this, this is a nice pushback.\n\n1:09:39.460 --> 1:09:40.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:40.460 --> 1:09:41.860\n The authenticity of Joe's show.\n\n1:09:41.860 --> 1:09:46.620\n I mean, I'm through, I started listening from the very beginning, you know, doing my in\n\n1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:51.900\n grad school, you know, like a technical person and he just pulled me in.\n\n1:09:51.900 --> 1:09:57.980\n And made me curious to learn about all kinds of things and use my own critical reasoning\n\n1:09:57.980 --> 1:10:02.740\n skills on some of the bullshit guests he's had and some of the most inspiring guests\n\n1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:03.740\n he's had.\n\n1:10:03.740 --> 1:10:08.740\n And so I teach you to think, can you, I don't know much about Bernie Madoff as a small tangent.\n\n1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:10.900\n Can you, can you tell me who the hell is Bernie Madoff?\n\n1:10:10.900 --> 1:10:13.380\n Oh, Bernie Madoff is the GOAT.\n\n1:10:13.380 --> 1:10:16.900\n The greatest thief of all time, dude.\n\n1:10:16.900 --> 1:10:22.180\n Hedge fund guy, ran a hedge fund and pulled, stole the most money in the history of America.\n\n1:10:22.180 --> 1:10:29.180\n I mean a con artist and he does, people obviously he's become, he's a household name because\n\n1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:34.060\n of the magnitude of his crime, but you got to appreciate, again, you got to appreciate\n\n1:10:34.060 --> 1:10:39.620\n what went into this and how long he was able to pull it off by tricking the smartest and\n\n1:10:39.620 --> 1:10:43.220\n richest people in the world and a brilliant scam.\n\n1:10:43.220 --> 1:10:47.460\n The con man, con man is short for confidence man.\n\n1:10:47.460 --> 1:10:53.220\n And it came from, yeah, a con man, basically they exude confidence and they trick people\n\n1:10:53.220 --> 1:10:56.340\n by playing on their ego and blind spots.\n\n1:10:56.340 --> 1:11:00.540\n And the word comes from a guy, I can't remember where, but what he used to do, I can't remember\n\n1:11:00.540 --> 1:11:03.860\n the guy's name, whatever, you can Google it, con man.\n\n1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:04.860\n But it's very interesting.\n\n1:11:04.860 --> 1:11:08.380\n The first con man that is on record, what he would do, he would go to very rich people\n\n1:11:08.380 --> 1:11:11.100\n and he'd be very well dressed, right?\n\n1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:16.740\n And he'd go, I bet you, you don't have the confidence to give me your watch.\n\n1:11:16.740 --> 1:11:19.700\n And he would play on the egos of these very powerful and rich people and they would give\n\n1:11:19.700 --> 1:11:23.340\n them the watch for some reason, some sort of reverse psychology bullshit.\n\n1:11:23.340 --> 1:11:27.540\n And he'd take the watch and he would just steal it because basically saying like, you\n\n1:11:27.540 --> 1:11:29.660\n don't have the confidence to give me the watch because you don't, I don't know, you don't\n\n1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:30.660\n think I'm going to give it back.\n\n1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:31.740\n And he would just take it.\n\n1:11:31.740 --> 1:11:35.460\n So Bernie Madoff was a very sophisticated con man.\n\n1:11:35.460 --> 1:11:39.100\n And again, we were talking about people pretending to be the opposite of what they are.\n\n1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:46.440\n And he hid his thievery in how available he was to his clients, how he would show up at\n\n1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:50.020\n every bar mitzvah, every birthday, he was always available for their phone calls.\n\n1:11:50.020 --> 1:11:52.340\n And he played on their egos.\n\n1:11:52.340 --> 1:11:56.620\n He made it so people wanted to invest in him, like they were competing.\n\n1:11:56.620 --> 1:11:58.380\n He made it very exclusive.\n\n1:11:58.380 --> 1:12:00.020\n He wouldn't just take anyone.\n\n1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:04.140\n And there was a method behind that madness because he wanted the whales that wouldn't\n\n1:12:04.140 --> 1:12:07.860\n notice that he had this pyramid scheme going.\n\n1:12:07.860 --> 1:12:11.780\n And so what he would do is he would just rob from the richer and he just kept, it was like\n\n1:12:11.780 --> 1:12:15.820\n he'd pay back the richer with the guy who was a little, and it was a pyramid scheme.\n\n1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:20.380\n And he was able to do it for so long and steal so much money.\n\n1:12:20.380 --> 1:12:24.320\n And he would win people over with the scheme because with that scheme, he was the only\n\n1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:30.340\n guy who could provide, who could guarantee like a 1% return even during times of recession.\n\n1:12:30.340 --> 1:12:35.580\n And because he was such a good con man, he hijacked people's reasoning with his charm.\n\n1:12:35.580 --> 1:12:36.860\n And that's what con artists do.\n\n1:12:36.860 --> 1:12:37.860\n That's what psychopaths do.\n\n1:12:37.860 --> 1:12:38.860\n They're so fucking charming.\n\n1:12:38.860 --> 1:12:41.260\n They get you in that Volkswagen Beetle.\n\n1:12:41.260 --> 1:12:45.060\n Because if they use their reasoning for one second, they'd go, hey, nobody can provide\n\n1:12:45.060 --> 1:12:46.860\n 1% returns during recessions.\n\n1:12:46.860 --> 1:12:48.180\n How the fuck is this guy doing it?\n\n1:12:48.180 --> 1:12:49.500\n I'll tell you how he's doing it.\n\n1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:51.740\n He's stealing from another guy to pay you.\n\n1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:52.900\n You fucking idiot.\n\n1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:54.860\n So charisma is essential to that.\n\n1:12:54.860 --> 1:13:00.060\n Maybe you can help explain something to me, something I have been affected by.\n\n1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:02.660\n I'm getting way too loud for your listeners, there's going to be comments like, tell this\n\n1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:03.660\n guy to calm down.\n\n1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:07.260\n I'm sorry, I'm Greek, I'm positive.\n\n1:13:07.260 --> 1:13:09.620\n No, that's beautiful.\n\n1:13:09.620 --> 1:13:10.980\n I love it.\n\n1:13:10.980 --> 1:13:15.060\n Something that I have been thinking about and have encountered indirectly is Jeffrey\n\n1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:16.820\n Epstein.\n\n1:13:16.820 --> 1:13:24.420\n And I have a sense because of MIT, because of all the other people that have been touched,\n\n1:13:24.420 --> 1:13:30.620\n the wrong term, by Jeffrey Epstein in the sense that literally and figuratively.\n\n1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:37.820\n And it always felt to me like there's not a deep conspiracy, I don't know, but it felt\n\n1:13:37.820 --> 1:13:44.340\n to me like it's not some deeply rooted conspiracy where like Eric Weinstein thinks that there's\n\n1:13:44.340 --> 1:13:50.860\n some probability that Jeffrey Epstein is a front for like an intelligence agency, whether\n\n1:13:50.860 --> 1:13:57.660\n it's Israeli or the CIA, I don't know, but is a front for something much, much bigger.\n\n1:13:57.660 --> 1:14:02.540\n And then I always thought that he's just, maybe you can correct me, but more of the\n\n1:14:02.540 --> 1:14:10.220\n Bernie Madoff variety, where he's just a charismatic guy who maybe is psychopathic in some sense,\n\n1:14:10.220 --> 1:14:16.860\n so you know, also a pedophile, but just charismatic and is able to convince people of that 1%\n\n1:14:16.860 --> 1:14:23.540\n of any idea that in the case of scientists is able to convince these people that their\n\n1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:25.380\n ideas matter.\n\n1:14:25.380 --> 1:14:29.860\n So one thing scientists don't really, you know, despite what people say, I don't think\n\n1:14:29.860 --> 1:14:32.020\n they care about money as much as people think.\n\n1:14:32.020 --> 1:14:35.140\n I mean, people are ridiculous when they think that, yeah, that's why people get into science\n\n1:14:35.140 --> 1:14:36.140\n for the money.\n\n1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:37.140\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:14:37.140 --> 1:14:41.220\n The personalities that get into science are obsessed with minutia and they do the scientific\n\n1:14:41.220 --> 1:14:42.220\n method.\n\n1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:43.220\n You know how boring that is?\n\n1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:46.620\n Like you have to have a love for it in order to do it.\n\n1:14:46.620 --> 1:14:52.420\n But the thing, what drives you is for your ideas to be then heard.\n\n1:14:52.420 --> 1:14:57.060\n Like when a rich guy comes over, probably super charismatic, is going to tell you that\n\n1:14:57.060 --> 1:15:03.020\n your ideas, especially for some of these outsiders at MIT, at Harvard, at Caltech, all these\n\n1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:13.540\n like sort of big science, like physics, biology, artificial intelligence, computing fields,\n\n1:15:13.540 --> 1:15:19.420\n to hear somebody say that your ideas are brilliant and ideas matter, it's pretty powerful, especially\n\n1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:21.420\n when you've been an outsider.\n\n1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:26.920\n Like he's talked to a bunch of people who had outsider ideas.\n\n1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:34.220\n You know, the big negative for me of modern academia is that most people, actually like\n\n1:15:34.220 --> 1:15:38.660\n most communities, most people think the same and there's just these brilliant outsiders\n\n1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:41.620\n and the outsiders are just derided.\n\n1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:47.700\n And so when you have Jeffrey Epstein, like a hyena, sorry, sorry, sorry, going on the\n\n1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:52.180\n outside and picking off these brilliant minds that are the outsiders, he can use charisma\n\n1:15:52.180 --> 1:15:59.540\n to convince them to collaborate with him, to take his funding and then thereby he builds\n\n1:15:59.540 --> 1:16:07.500\n a reputation, like slowly accumulates these people that actually results in a network\n\n1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:12.180\n of like some of those brilliant people in the world, you know, and then pulls in people\n\n1:16:12.180 --> 1:16:16.700\n like Bill Gates and I don't know, political figures.\n\n1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:19.300\n I tend to believe that one person can do that.\n\n1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:20.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:20.300 --> 1:16:22.860\n I mean, look at Hitler, charisma is blinding.\n\n1:16:22.860 --> 1:16:27.820\n I think that's what Kahneman, speaking of Bernie Madoff, that's one of their major tools\n\n1:16:27.820 --> 1:16:31.700\n is flattery, glib, superficial charm.\n\n1:16:31.700 --> 1:16:33.380\n It creates those blind spots.\n\n1:16:33.380 --> 1:16:34.580\n People want to hear how great they are.\n\n1:16:34.580 --> 1:16:36.460\n They want to be flattered.\n\n1:16:36.460 --> 1:16:42.580\n It takes your defenses down, plays to our ego, how much we're all just pieces of garbage\n\n1:16:42.580 --> 1:16:44.140\n and want to hear how great we are.\n\n1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:46.580\n We want that love from our mother and our father.\n\n1:16:46.580 --> 1:16:52.460\n That's Freudian and they know because they're not burdened with that need, they're not burdened\n\n1:16:52.460 --> 1:16:59.220\n with that empathy or emotions and they just see things very calculatively.\n\n1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:04.300\n They play, they know that we're prey in their game and they use that against us and that\n\n1:17:04.300 --> 1:17:09.760\n is why someone who is not that intelligent, like Hitler, can probably convince a lot more\n\n1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:14.100\n intelligent people, you know, and that's why we can't give Tim Dillon power because then,\n\n1:17:14.100 --> 1:17:15.860\n you know, he already stands on a stage.\n\n1:17:15.860 --> 1:17:19.460\n I mean, if we let that guy, I mean, he will just take over a country and everyone who\n\n1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:21.740\n can't cook well will be eliminated.\n\n1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:22.740\n So it's like...\n\n1:17:22.740 --> 1:17:25.020\n I wonder why he keeps complimenting me when we're in private.\n\n1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:26.020\n Exactly.\n\n1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:27.020\n Be careful.\n\n1:17:27.020 --> 1:17:29.060\n He looks at me just, I like your suit.\n\n1:17:29.060 --> 1:17:30.540\n I like the cut of your jib.\n\n1:17:30.540 --> 1:17:31.540\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n1:17:31.540 --> 1:17:32.540\n You gotta be careful of that kid.\n\n1:17:32.540 --> 1:17:33.540\n He's Hitler.\n\n1:17:33.540 --> 1:17:35.700\n But it's crazy to think about...\n\n1:17:35.700 --> 1:17:36.700\n Clip that, please.\n\n1:17:36.700 --> 1:17:37.700\n Internet.\n\n1:17:37.700 --> 1:17:40.980\n I mean, Quentin Tarantino said it to Pat, I mean, in his script, personality goes a long\n\n1:17:40.980 --> 1:17:41.980\n way, dude.\n\n1:17:41.980 --> 1:17:48.420\n I mean, personality can usurp common sense and reason of the smartest people.\n\n1:17:48.420 --> 1:17:52.840\n These absolute smartest people can be hypnotized.\n\n1:17:52.840 --> 1:17:54.900\n It's sort of like a sexy woman.\n\n1:17:54.900 --> 1:18:00.180\n It's like, you can just, you can be tricked because we have such a blind spot for, you\n\n1:18:00.180 --> 1:18:02.220\n know, for flattery.\n\n1:18:02.220 --> 1:18:03.860\n Yeah, I wonder.\n\n1:18:03.860 --> 1:18:08.900\n I think there's a BBC documentary on, I think it's called something like Charisma, Hitler's\n\n1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:10.700\n Charisma or something like that.\n\n1:18:10.700 --> 1:18:15.420\n It was quite, I mean, that one focused more about the power of the speeches.\n\n1:18:15.420 --> 1:18:21.740\n But I wonder if most of the success or the rise of Hitler and the Third Reich had to\n\n1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:27.820\n do with the charisma of Hitler when he's alone in a room with somebody, with the generals,\n\n1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:28.820\n just one on one.\n\n1:18:28.820 --> 1:18:34.980\n Like, I wonder if that's the essential element of just being able to just look into a person's\n\n1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:41.980\n eyes, like flatter them or whatever is needed to earn their trust and then convince them\n\n1:18:41.980 --> 1:18:43.540\n of anything you want.\n\n1:18:43.540 --> 1:18:44.540\n Right.\n\n1:18:44.540 --> 1:18:45.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:45.540 --> 1:18:46.540\n I mean, you're right.\n\n1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:49.820\n Because that's the one piece of history we don't have.\n\n1:18:49.820 --> 1:18:50.820\n We don't know.\n\n1:18:50.820 --> 1:18:53.180\n We do know that the kid crushed.\n\n1:18:53.180 --> 1:18:55.060\n I mean, he was a headliner.\n\n1:18:55.060 --> 1:18:58.340\n He got up there and his hair would flop.\n\n1:18:58.340 --> 1:19:00.780\n I mean, he crushed it.\n\n1:19:00.780 --> 1:19:04.260\n Yeah, there's certain elements about nationalism and pride that are really powerful.\n\n1:19:04.260 --> 1:19:10.980\n Like a lot of us humans, I think, long for that, for the feeling of belonging.\n\n1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:18.380\n And when some charismatic leader makes us feel like we belong to a group, the amount\n\n1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:23.500\n of evil we can do to other humans because of that, it's endless.\n\n1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:26.760\n Nobody wants to look and nobody wants to do the work to be better or look at where they\n\n1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:27.760\n messed up.\n\n1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:29.180\n Why does it always have to be the Jews that escape?\n\n1:19:29.180 --> 1:19:32.580\n You know, it's like, get over it, guys.\n\n1:19:32.580 --> 1:19:34.620\n I mean, it's like they killed Jesus.\n\n1:19:34.620 --> 1:19:35.620\n You get over it.\n\n1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:36.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:37.620\n Okay.\n\n1:19:37.620 --> 1:19:38.620\n It's a long time ago.\n\n1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:39.620\n I mean, move on.\n\n1:19:39.620 --> 1:19:40.620\n I'm Jewish.\n\n1:19:40.620 --> 1:19:41.620\n I understand because we do run the central banks.\n\n1:19:41.620 --> 1:19:42.740\n And the weather.\n\n1:19:42.740 --> 1:19:43.740\n And the weather.\n\n1:19:43.740 --> 1:19:44.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:44.740 --> 1:19:45.740\n Don't forget about the weather.\n\n1:19:45.740 --> 1:19:46.740\n That's a big one.\n\n1:19:46.740 --> 1:19:47.740\n That's a funny one that people created.\n\n1:19:47.740 --> 1:19:48.740\n Like, who gives a shit?\n\n1:19:48.740 --> 1:19:49.740\n What is the weather?\n\n1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:50.740\n Like, what's the importance of the weather?\n\n1:19:50.740 --> 1:19:51.740\n All right.\n\n1:19:51.740 --> 1:19:52.740\n The Jews made it rain outside.\n\n1:19:52.740 --> 1:19:53.740\n Good.\n\n1:19:53.740 --> 1:19:54.740\n You got to fuck.\n\n1:19:54.740 --> 1:19:55.740\n You know, they made it snow.\n\n1:19:55.740 --> 1:19:56.740\n Okay.\n\n1:19:56.740 --> 1:19:57.740\n You get a day off.\n\n1:19:57.740 --> 1:19:58.740\n Thank the Jews.\n\n1:19:58.740 --> 1:19:59.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:59.740 --> 1:20:00.740\n It's like, yeah, there's certain conspiracies that make me like flat earth.\n\n1:20:00.740 --> 1:20:01.740\n Like, what's the motive?\n\n1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:04.260\n What's the motivation for lying that the earth is round?\n\n1:20:04.260 --> 1:20:05.260\n Like, what's the conspiracy?\n\n1:20:05.260 --> 1:20:06.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:06.260 --> 1:20:07.260\n What does anyone get out of that?\n\n1:20:07.260 --> 1:20:08.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:09.260\n What is exactly the profit?\n\n1:20:09.260 --> 1:20:10.260\n What's the strategy?\n\n1:20:10.260 --> 1:20:17.300\n Do you have any, from a historical perspective or just a human perspective, conspiracy theories\n\n1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:18.300\n you connect with?\n\n1:20:18.300 --> 1:20:22.420\n Or you're not necessarily conspiratorial?\n\n1:20:22.420 --> 1:20:26.060\n I'm not necessarily conspiratorial.\n\n1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:30.580\n Nobody cares that much.\n\n1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:36.420\n But then, you know, what happens is you find out this one or this two, and you start questioning\n\n1:20:36.420 --> 1:20:37.420\n everything.\n\n1:20:37.420 --> 1:20:38.420\n And you start questioning everything, man.\n\n1:20:38.420 --> 1:20:42.540\n It's like, you know, the Vietnam War started, that was a lie.\n\n1:20:42.540 --> 1:20:43.540\n That was a false flag.\n\n1:20:43.540 --> 1:20:45.960\n And then next thing you know, everything's a false flag.\n\n1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:49.860\n There are some strange things on 9 11.\n\n1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:52.100\n You know, there's some strange things from a scientific perspective.\n\n1:20:52.100 --> 1:20:58.120\n I'm no scientist, but it's like, you know, yeah, three steel framed skyscrapers falling\n\n1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:00.580\n on the same day in the same way.\n\n1:21:00.580 --> 1:21:03.580\n A lot of people say, oh, they were hit by planes.\n\n1:21:03.580 --> 1:21:04.780\n It's like, yeah, but that's not why they fell.\n\n1:21:04.780 --> 1:21:13.180\n They fell because of fires and usually, not usually, all the time, except for three times.\n\n1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:17.140\n And there was buildings that have burned for longer than that.\n\n1:21:17.140 --> 1:21:21.180\n And there might be good explanations, but the lack of transparency, it's like, I feel\n\n1:21:21.180 --> 1:21:22.260\n like government.\n\n1:21:22.260 --> 1:21:23.260\n And building seven's weird.\n\n1:21:23.260 --> 1:21:27.660\n I mean, the way it kind of died, just a neat, just a neat, the physical, I mean, you're\n\n1:21:27.660 --> 1:21:28.660\n a scientist.\n\n1:21:28.660 --> 1:21:34.380\n Is that, well, I don't, I, is there resistance from the steel and free fall, not all scientists\n\n1:21:34.380 --> 1:21:35.380\n know everything.\n\n1:21:35.380 --> 1:21:36.380\n I'm just a computer guy.\n\n1:21:36.380 --> 1:21:40.980\n Cause I had some questions I wanted to ask you about my biology, but yeah, so exactly.\n\n1:21:40.980 --> 1:21:41.980\n I don't understand biology.\n\n1:21:41.980 --> 1:21:43.980\n I don't understand the melting point of steel.\n\n1:21:43.980 --> 1:21:49.560\n I don't, but I'm just the common sense human that looks at government and institutions\n\n1:21:49.560 --> 1:21:51.520\n when they try to communicate.\n\n1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:56.240\n And there's a certain human element where you can sense that there's dishonesty going\n\n1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:57.240\n on.\n\n1:21:57.240 --> 1:22:01.100\n And dishonesty might not be deeply rooted in a conspiracy theory and something malevolent.\n\n1:22:01.100 --> 1:22:06.980\n It might just be rooted more likely to me in a basic fear of losing your job.\n\n1:22:06.980 --> 1:22:10.500\n So when you have a bunch of people that are afraid of losing their job, you know, and\n\n1:22:10.500 --> 1:22:16.660\n they just don't want to like the origins of the virus, whether it came from a lab or not,\n\n1:22:16.660 --> 1:22:22.020\n you know, that's a pretty, I know a lot of biologists behind a closed doors that, that\n\n1:22:22.020 --> 1:22:25.620\n say it's very likely it was leaked from the lab.\n\n1:22:25.620 --> 1:22:29.340\n But like, they don't want to talk about it because there's not good evidence either way.\n\n1:22:29.340 --> 1:22:32.060\n It's mostly you're just using common sense.\n\n1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:35.620\n So they're waiting for good evidence to come out in either direction.\n\n1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:40.980\n But just like nobody in positions of institutional, like centralized power wants to just honestly\n\n1:22:40.980 --> 1:22:46.540\n say, we don't know, or on the point of masks or all those kinds of things to say, you know,\n\n1:22:46.540 --> 1:22:47.760\n here's the best evidence we have.\n\n1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:49.220\n We're not sure we're trying to figure that out.\n\n1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:53.780\n We're desperately trying to figure that out or just like honesty, especially in the modern\n\n1:22:53.780 --> 1:22:56.820\n day, that's the hope I have for the 21st centuries.\n\n1:22:56.820 --> 1:23:00.140\n People seem to detect bullshit much, much better because of the internet.\n\n1:23:00.140 --> 1:23:01.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:02.140\n Internet.\n\n1:23:02.140 --> 1:23:03.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:03.140 --> 1:23:04.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:04.140 --> 1:23:05.140\n And we seem to...\n\n1:23:05.140 --> 1:23:06.140\n But they also believe crazy shit too.\n\n1:23:06.140 --> 1:23:07.140\n There's no Yang without a Yang, I guess.\n\n1:23:07.140 --> 1:23:12.380\n But I think the conspiracy theories arise only when the people in positions of power\n\n1:23:12.380 --> 1:23:15.340\n and government institutions are full of shit.\n\n1:23:15.340 --> 1:23:19.640\n Like the air will be taken out of the conspiracy theories if the people in elected power would\n\n1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:20.640\n be much more honest.\n\n1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:21.640\n Like just like real.\n\n1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:26.340\n Yeah, people like Andrew Yang, whatever you think about him, just more honest.\n\n1:23:26.340 --> 1:23:29.500\n He just like says whatever the hell comes to mind.\n\n1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:31.780\n By the way, he's running for New York mayor.\n\n1:23:31.780 --> 1:23:32.780\n Mayor, yeah.\n\n1:23:32.780 --> 1:23:34.380\n Do you have opinions?\n\n1:23:34.380 --> 1:23:35.780\n Yeah, it's no good.\n\n1:23:35.780 --> 1:23:37.660\n I like Andrew Yang and it's no good.\n\n1:23:37.660 --> 1:23:39.020\n I'd be honest with you.\n\n1:23:39.020 --> 1:23:40.420\n I'm a lifelong New Yorker.\n\n1:23:40.420 --> 1:23:41.580\n I mean, I'm a New Yorker.\n\n1:23:41.580 --> 1:23:44.340\n Well, you're a New Yorker, so nothing's good.\n\n1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:45.740\n Well, something is good.\n\n1:23:45.740 --> 1:23:46.740\n Okay.\n\n1:23:46.740 --> 1:23:49.140\n Let's be honest about New York.\n\n1:23:49.140 --> 1:23:51.140\n It's a very socially liberal place.\n\n1:23:51.140 --> 1:23:52.900\n It is the head of the snake.\n\n1:23:52.900 --> 1:23:54.420\n New York is the country.\n\n1:23:54.420 --> 1:23:58.460\n If New York, when New York's not doing good, country's not doing good.\n\n1:23:58.460 --> 1:24:01.540\n It's the most important city, DC, New York.\n\n1:24:01.540 --> 1:24:02.540\n It's really Rome.\n\n1:24:02.540 --> 1:24:03.540\n Be honest.\n\n1:24:03.540 --> 1:24:04.540\n It's, maybe I'm biased.\n\n1:24:04.540 --> 1:24:05.540\n I don't know.\n\n1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:06.540\n No.\n\n1:24:06.540 --> 1:24:07.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:07.540 --> 1:24:10.940\n We just, New Yorkers, we walk around everywhere and we go, this is just like New York, but\n\n1:24:10.940 --> 1:24:11.940\n not New York.\n\n1:24:11.940 --> 1:24:17.660\n It's, but New York needs, and I'm a guy who leans left.\n\n1:24:17.660 --> 1:24:20.220\n You know, I just, I lean left and that's just what it is.\n\n1:24:20.220 --> 1:24:21.220\n A dictator?\n\n1:24:21.220 --> 1:24:22.220\n Is that where you're going?\n\n1:24:22.220 --> 1:24:23.220\n No, we need.\n\n1:24:23.220 --> 1:24:24.220\n Are we going back to Stalin again?\n\n1:24:24.220 --> 1:24:25.220\n We need, it's a money town.\n\n1:24:25.220 --> 1:24:26.500\n Let's be, come on, man.\n\n1:24:26.500 --> 1:24:29.740\n I mean, New York is a money town.\n\n1:24:29.740 --> 1:24:36.620\n And Wall Street, and then when AOC and her cronies at the local level rejected that Amazon\n\n1:24:36.620 --> 1:24:40.260\n thing, you're going like, what do you think makes cities?\n\n1:24:40.260 --> 1:24:42.340\n What's going to create jobs in the 21st century?\n\n1:24:42.340 --> 1:24:43.340\n What do we need?\n\n1:24:43.340 --> 1:24:44.340\n More nail salons?\n\n1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:45.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:46.340\n More pizza places?\n\n1:24:46.340 --> 1:24:49.740\n I mean, we're living in the tech revolution and you know, whatever your opinions are\n\n1:24:49.740 --> 1:24:53.580\n about Jeff Bezos, that's the world, tech.\n\n1:24:53.580 --> 1:24:54.740\n And they want you to come here.\n\n1:24:54.740 --> 1:24:56.140\n Of course you give them tax breaks.\n\n1:24:56.140 --> 1:24:58.340\n That's why companies go anywhere.\n\n1:24:58.340 --> 1:25:04.220\n She's so fucking utopian and that progressive wing is so utopian and that always ends in\n\n1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:06.720\n disaster because it's not rooted in reality.\n\n1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:09.560\n It doesn't accept the reality that people are self interested.\n\n1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:13.920\n Now they're going to do this 14%, 15% tax hike on people making a million dollars more.\n\n1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:16.340\n In New York City, a million dollars is not that much.\n\n1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:18.120\n So people are going to flee New York.\n\n1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:19.900\n The tax base is going to flee.\n\n1:25:19.900 --> 1:25:21.900\n New York's going to fall to shit like it did before.\n\n1:25:21.900 --> 1:25:25.620\n So you're saying it basically needs a more capitalist front, like capitalistic type of\n\n1:25:25.620 --> 1:25:26.620\n thinker.\n\n1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:27.620\n Yes.\n\n1:25:27.620 --> 1:25:31.260\n Bloomberg, Giuliani when he was still sane and his hair wasn't melting off his face.\n\n1:25:31.260 --> 1:25:32.260\n Prosecutor.\n\n1:25:32.260 --> 1:25:34.580\n You need a tough, I mean, I don't know what's happened to that guy.\n\n1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:35.580\n He's lost it.\n\n1:25:35.580 --> 1:25:36.580\n But it's fun.\n\n1:25:36.580 --> 1:25:37.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:38.580\n It's fun to watch.\n\n1:25:38.580 --> 1:25:39.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:40.580\n It's fun to watch him be just like, uh, Trump's lackey.\n\n1:25:40.580 --> 1:25:41.580\n Like, yeah, boy, whatever you want, boss.\n\n1:25:41.580 --> 1:25:43.620\n I'll just say whatever you want, boss.\n\n1:25:43.620 --> 1:25:49.300\n But New York is a money town that needs a money guy and sort of more of a Republican.\n\n1:25:49.300 --> 1:25:53.680\n I have to say on the local level, as more of a guy who leans left, I'll just be honest.\n\n1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:58.140\n It's a tough city that needs a tough mayor, not some guy who's going like, I understand\n\n1:25:58.140 --> 1:25:59.460\n we all need free money.\n\n1:25:59.460 --> 1:26:03.780\n You know, Andrew Yang I think is right in the big picture because all the real jobs\n\n1:26:03.780 --> 1:26:04.780\n are somewhere else.\n\n1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:07.860\n You look at those Asian cities, you go like, oh, that's what our cities used to look like\n\n1:26:07.860 --> 1:26:09.540\n at the industrial revolution.\n\n1:26:09.540 --> 1:26:12.340\n You know, there was like, there was jobs and people were making things here.\n\n1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:15.140\n Now you look at those cities in Asia and you're going like, wow.\n\n1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.620\n And then you go to Detroit and you're like, yeah, we're done.\n\n1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:19.920\n You go to Cleveland, you go, we were done.\n\n1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:22.420\n So I don't actually, it's, it's funny.\n\n1:26:22.420 --> 1:26:27.400\n The reason I really like Andrew Yang is I've learned a lot every time he talks, like it's\n\n1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:28.880\n not his opinions.\n\n1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:33.180\n He's just giving a lot of data, like information, which I just start a podcast.\n\n1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:34.180\n Don't run for mayor.\n\n1:26:34.180 --> 1:26:35.180\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n1:26:35.180 --> 1:26:36.180\n He already has a podcast.\n\n1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:37.180\n I think Yang speaks.\n\n1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:38.180\n Who doesn't?\n\n1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:39.180\n Who does it?\n\n1:26:39.180 --> 1:26:40.180\n Who does it now?\n\n1:26:40.180 --> 1:26:41.180\n That's the way we communicate.\n\n1:26:41.180 --> 1:26:43.700\n I don't even talk to people unless it's on a podcast.\n\n1:26:43.700 --> 1:26:44.700\n What?\n\n1:26:44.700 --> 1:26:48.420\n Listen, man, I'm a, I'm not going to criticize that because there is something like I talked\n\n1:26:48.420 --> 1:26:55.580\n to my dad on a podcast for four hours and I'm not sure I would ever talk to him in the\n\n1:26:55.580 --> 1:26:57.500\n way we talked without the podcast.\n\n1:26:57.500 --> 1:26:58.500\n What does he do?\n\n1:26:58.500 --> 1:26:59.500\n Uh, physicist.\n\n1:26:59.500 --> 1:27:00.500\n Oh shit.\n\n1:27:00.500 --> 1:27:05.020\n But like, yeah, it's a episode 100.\n\n1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:14.740\n And you know, I, uh, the, the way I recorded that podcast is I tried to put my ego aside.\n\n1:27:14.740 --> 1:27:18.100\n It's actually really tough to talk to your dad, especially because you're giving him\n\n1:27:18.100 --> 1:27:19.100\n a platform.\n\n1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:24.660\n Uh, especially, so at that time there's already a bit of a platform for this podcast.\n\n1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:30.660\n And so there's this, as a son, you think like, oh, here it goes with this bullshit again.\n\n1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:34.620\n Like that's the natural son thought you have.\n\n1:27:34.620 --> 1:27:39.180\n But at the same time, I wanted to, the way I thought about it is in 20 years when I look\n\n1:27:39.180 --> 1:27:43.660\n back, like I want to do a conversation where I'm happy with it, you know?\n\n1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:46.020\n So I want to make him shine.\n\n1:27:46.020 --> 1:27:51.220\n But I also called him out on like, why were you so distant, like, like all of that kind\n\n1:27:51.220 --> 1:27:52.220\n of stuff.\n\n1:27:52.220 --> 1:27:53.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:53.220 --> 1:27:54.740\n It was very difficult to do, but it was really important to do.\n\n1:27:54.740 --> 1:27:58.100\n And I don't think I'd be able to do it without a, without a microphone.\n\n1:27:58.100 --> 1:27:59.100\n Right.\n\n1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:02.620\n Listen, how often do we sit there and just focus our attention and just look at the other\n\n1:28:02.620 --> 1:28:03.620\n person?\n\n1:28:03.620 --> 1:28:05.780\n I, I don't know, man.\n\n1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:07.340\n This is not even recording right now.\n\n1:28:07.340 --> 1:28:10.540\n I just invited you over.\n\n1:28:10.540 --> 1:28:11.900\n Just so we could actually, you're right.\n\n1:28:11.900 --> 1:28:15.700\n The podcast does make, like I listen, I've been listening to every word you've been saying.\n\n1:28:15.700 --> 1:28:19.740\n And if we weren't doing a podcast, I might be looking at my phone or being self conscious\n\n1:28:19.740 --> 1:28:23.660\n about something else or nervous or anxious, especially with people close to you.\n\n1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:29.620\n I mean, that was, I recommend that actually for people to talk to their family on a podcast\n\n1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:31.300\n or like a fake or not.\n\n1:28:31.300 --> 1:28:32.300\n That's really powerful.\n\n1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:37.260\n It made me realize that there's a clear distinction between the conversations we usually have\n\n1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:43.340\n with humans and those we have when a podcast is being recorded.\n\n1:28:43.340 --> 1:28:46.060\n What the fuck were we talking on before that?\n\n1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:49.220\n I knew you were going to lose your train of thought on that one because that's a big one.\n\n1:28:49.220 --> 1:28:50.660\n There's a motion behind that one.\n\n1:28:50.660 --> 1:28:53.900\n A podcast with dad is going to take, that's going to take you to a place that took you\n\n1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:54.900\n to a place.\n\n1:28:54.900 --> 1:28:57.260\n It took you outside of interviewer.\n\n1:28:57.260 --> 1:28:58.260\n New York.\n\n1:28:58.260 --> 1:28:59.260\n It went to a place.\n\n1:28:59.260 --> 1:29:00.260\n New York and Yang.\n\n1:29:00.260 --> 1:29:01.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:02.260\n In New York and Yang.\n\n1:29:02.260 --> 1:29:07.140\n That's what really surprised me about, I like the psychoanalysis that you just threw in\n\n1:29:07.140 --> 1:29:08.140\n there.\n\n1:29:08.140 --> 1:29:09.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:09.140 --> 1:29:10.140\n I knew that.\n\n1:29:10.140 --> 1:29:11.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:12.140\n That took you to a place.\n\n1:29:12.140 --> 1:29:13.140\n So Andrew Yang mentioned.\n\n1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:14.140\n Do you respect me now, dad?\n\n1:29:14.140 --> 1:29:15.140\n MIT, is it enough?\n\n1:29:15.140 --> 1:29:16.140\n Fucking million people listening to this.\n\n1:29:16.140 --> 1:29:17.140\n I got 14 Rogans.\n\n1:29:17.140 --> 1:29:18.140\n Is it enough, dad?\n\n1:29:18.140 --> 1:29:19.140\n I'm creating robots.\n\n1:29:19.140 --> 1:29:20.140\n Is it enough for you?\n\n1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:21.140\n It's never enough.\n\n1:29:21.140 --> 1:29:26.140\n That's what drives you probably.\n\n1:29:26.140 --> 1:29:27.300\n That's probably what drives me.\n\n1:29:27.300 --> 1:29:30.500\n That's what gives meaning to life is it's never enough.\n\n1:29:30.500 --> 1:29:33.380\n And I hope to pass that on to my kids one day.\n\n1:29:33.380 --> 1:29:34.380\n That nothing's ever enough.\n\n1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:36.380\n Whether they're robot or human, right?\n\n1:29:36.380 --> 1:29:37.380\n Your kids.\n\n1:29:37.380 --> 1:29:38.380\n Most likely.\n\n1:29:38.380 --> 1:29:39.380\n Let's be honest.\n\n1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:40.380\n Robot.\n\n1:29:40.380 --> 1:29:41.380\n You might call one of your robot.\n\n1:29:41.380 --> 1:29:42.380\n Do you love your robot?\n\n1:29:42.380 --> 1:29:43.380\n Are you starting to love your...\n\n1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:44.380\n Is it going to be like that Pygmalion thing?\n\n1:29:44.380 --> 1:29:45.380\n You create them and then they kill you.\n\n1:29:45.380 --> 1:29:46.380\n But even while they're killing you, you got a tear.\n\n1:29:46.380 --> 1:29:47.380\n The tear.\n\n1:29:47.380 --> 1:29:48.380\n A slow one.\n\n1:29:48.380 --> 1:29:49.380\n One tear.\n\n1:29:49.380 --> 1:29:50.380\n One tear.\n\n1:29:50.380 --> 1:29:51.380\n And just.\n\n1:29:51.380 --> 1:29:52.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:52.380 --> 1:29:53.380\n Why are you doing this Frankenstein?\n\n1:29:53.380 --> 1:29:54.380\n Why?\n\n1:29:54.380 --> 1:29:55.380\n Why?\n\n1:29:55.380 --> 1:29:56.380\n But I loved you.\n\n1:29:56.380 --> 1:29:57.380\n Those would be the last words out of my mouth.\n\n1:29:57.380 --> 1:30:03.940\n I just want to mention something on the, that it costs $400,000.\n\n1:30:03.940 --> 1:30:11.380\n Over $400,000 per year to support one person in prison in New York.\n\n1:30:11.380 --> 1:30:15.380\n Like when I heard that number, it was really confusing to me.\n\n1:30:15.380 --> 1:30:21.300\n Like that it costs that much, 400K per person.\n\n1:30:21.300 --> 1:30:27.260\n And it was really refreshing to hear a politician describe a particular problem with data.\n\n1:30:27.260 --> 1:30:31.060\n That this is this prison industrial complex, whatever the hell it is.\n\n1:30:31.060 --> 1:30:33.940\n And whether the solution, it's unclear what the solution is.\n\n1:30:33.940 --> 1:30:39.500\n I think he has solutions, but just the honesty of presenting that information was refreshing.\n\n1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:43.060\n And I'm not sure a capitalistic person would solve that.\n\n1:30:43.060 --> 1:30:44.980\n Those kinds of problems he might make worse.\n\n1:30:44.980 --> 1:30:48.780\n And I'm not, I'm a huge fan of capitalism.\n\n1:30:48.780 --> 1:30:56.180\n I think the free market is the way we make progress in this world, but it seems to go\n\n1:30:56.180 --> 1:30:58.460\n wrong in certain directions.\n\n1:30:58.460 --> 1:31:01.780\n Like the military industrial complex, the prison industrial complex, anything that ends\n\n1:31:01.780 --> 1:31:04.280\n with industrial complex.\n\n1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:06.260\n And so I'm not sure.\n\n1:31:06.260 --> 1:31:14.420\n I'm not sure if all of the problems, you're basically saying, let's put New York's problems\n\n1:31:14.420 --> 1:31:16.700\n aside.\n\n1:31:16.700 --> 1:31:20.660\n We need to have New York shine first to do what it does best.\n\n1:31:20.660 --> 1:31:21.660\n Essentially.\n\n1:31:21.660 --> 1:31:22.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:22.660 --> 1:31:26.300\n And then we will fix them, well, and then we can focus on the problems.\n\n1:31:26.300 --> 1:31:29.380\n But if you just say like, here's a problem, here's a problem, here's a problem, let's\n\n1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:32.760\n make sure we have the safety net that protects us against all of these kinds of problems.\n\n1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:38.260\n That's not going to, that's going to kill the city, the spirit of the city that is in\n\n1:31:38.260 --> 1:31:42.820\n your biased opinion, the Rome of the world.\n\n1:31:42.820 --> 1:31:44.580\n That said, a lot of people are fleeing New York.\n\n1:31:44.580 --> 1:31:46.700\n Yeah, that's why I say it.\n\n1:31:46.700 --> 1:31:51.800\n That's the reality of the situation is, you know, I'm all for the public good, but yeah,\n\n1:31:51.800 --> 1:31:56.700\n there needs to be a back to that Greek expression, pan metroniris, and I also think the free\n\n1:31:56.700 --> 1:31:58.820\n market is responsible for progress.\n\n1:31:58.820 --> 1:32:02.100\n I think it's the most natural thing, the thing that's most aligned with human nature, which\n\n1:32:02.100 --> 1:32:03.860\n is self interest.\n\n1:32:03.860 --> 1:32:07.860\n And which I'm not to the extent that Ayn Rand would, but I do believe people are mostly\n\n1:32:07.860 --> 1:32:13.140\n self interested, especially with one gun to the head, morals are out the window, you know,\n\n1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:14.140\n it's about survival.\n\n1:32:14.140 --> 1:32:18.940\n So, you know, create a system that respects that and acknowledges that, but socialism\n\n1:32:18.940 --> 1:32:25.580\n works very well, at least right now, as a check as to temper the excesses of capitalism\n\n1:32:25.580 --> 1:32:31.760\n and in certain scenarios is the more appropriate system, you know, in a vacuum.\n\n1:32:31.760 --> 1:32:38.700\n So one being prisons or, you know, you know, governance, you know, parks.\n\n1:32:38.700 --> 1:32:44.000\n Maybe even, well, and this is a difficult one, but in healthcare, healthcare, it's unclear\n\n1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:45.000\n what to write.\n\n1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:46.000\n There's a lot of debates there.\n\n1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.000\n Doctors want boats.\n\n1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:49.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:50.980\n So I guess you're voting for AOC you're saying.\n\n1:32:50.980 --> 1:32:54.980\n No, I'm not voting for AOC, but I do, it's just a tough one.\n\n1:32:54.980 --> 1:32:55.980\n That's a tough one.\n\n1:32:55.980 --> 1:33:01.740\n But ultimately, the Hippocratic Oath, it's like, how do you turn people away, man?\n\n1:33:01.740 --> 1:33:02.840\n How do you do that to people?\n\n1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:13.580\n It's like, it's a tough thing to reconcile helping people, curing people with the marketplace.\n\n1:33:13.580 --> 1:33:16.620\n It's just, I can understand why that one's so tough.\n\n1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:19.980\n And then you got hypochondriacs, of course, who drain the system, you know, like people\n\n1:33:19.980 --> 1:33:26.660\n who are having anxiety, like me who had COVID and called 14, you know, I called 14 ambulances.\n\n1:33:26.660 --> 1:33:31.380\n So and then of course we're fat and the free market made us fat because it played the marketing\n\n1:33:31.380 --> 1:33:34.500\n made us want all this junk food and that's a burden on the healthcare system.\n\n1:33:34.500 --> 1:33:35.500\n So we got to do something about that.\n\n1:33:35.500 --> 1:33:36.500\n We got to get creative.\n\n1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:37.500\n We need new thinkers.\n\n1:33:37.500 --> 1:33:38.500\n I'll be one of them.\n\n1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:41.020\n When you go to a fast food restaurant, you stand on a scale.\n\n1:33:41.020 --> 1:33:44.060\n If you're over a certain thing, you can't be served.\n\n1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:45.620\n It's good for the healthcare system.\n\n1:33:45.620 --> 1:33:49.620\n You know, you just handed a salad and say, sorry, this burger is illegal for right now.\n\n1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:56.100\n If you achieve these certain BMI goals, then you can, you can have this burger, but right\n\n1:33:56.100 --> 1:33:57.100\n now you can't.\n\n1:33:57.100 --> 1:33:58.100\n And that's where the state's important.\n\n1:33:58.100 --> 1:33:59.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:00.100\n Okay.\n\n1:34:00.100 --> 1:34:01.100\n To regulate our freedoms.\n\n1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:02.100\n No slurpees.\n\n1:34:02.100 --> 1:34:03.100\n I'm with you Bloomberg.\n\n1:34:03.100 --> 1:34:04.820\n Well, I'm with you to go along.\n\n1:34:04.820 --> 1:34:06.300\n I think the salads are too expensive.\n\n1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:07.380\n They should be subsidized.\n\n1:34:07.380 --> 1:34:11.940\n If you, if you go to like a fast food joint, the burger is always going to be cheaper than\n\n1:34:11.940 --> 1:34:12.940\n the salad.\n\n1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:13.940\n And this does not make sense.\n\n1:34:13.940 --> 1:34:14.940\n We should run on this platform.\n\n1:34:14.940 --> 1:34:19.980\n I'll be your vice president or ban burgers for, for people of a certain weight and make\n\n1:34:19.980 --> 1:34:21.100\n salads cheap.\n\n1:34:21.100 --> 1:34:22.300\n Three day work weeks.\n\n1:34:22.300 --> 1:34:23.300\n Why has that not happened yet?\n\n1:34:23.300 --> 1:34:24.300\n Wait, wait.\n\n1:34:24.300 --> 1:34:25.300\n Okay.\n\n1:34:25.300 --> 1:34:26.300\n Where are you going with this one?\n\n1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:27.300\n Dude, good for the economy.\n\n1:34:27.300 --> 1:34:28.300\n Stimulates the economy, right?\n\n1:34:28.300 --> 1:34:32.380\n More shifts, creates more jobs, more people spending because they have more leisure time,\n\n1:34:32.380 --> 1:34:34.940\n boosts the leisure economy, you know?\n\n1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:38.580\n Why are we still doing the five day work week that, that was, that was tempered from the\n\n1:34:38.580 --> 1:34:39.580\n seven day work week.\n\n1:34:39.580 --> 1:34:43.460\n That was, so the seven, it used to be seven day work week, it used to be like, and people\n\n1:34:43.460 --> 1:34:46.780\n who are just these libertarians, it's like, come on dude, what, what is this fresh, are\n\n1:34:46.780 --> 1:34:47.780\n we freshmen in college?\n\n1:34:47.780 --> 1:34:48.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:50.300\n You're going to, we're going to talk about Ayn Rand next.\n\n1:34:50.300 --> 1:34:51.580\n Like let's talk about reality.\n\n1:34:51.580 --> 1:34:52.580\n Okay.\n\n1:34:52.580 --> 1:34:53.580\n And human nature.\n\n1:34:53.580 --> 1:34:54.580\n People are fucking greedy.\n\n1:34:54.580 --> 1:34:55.580\n They lie.\n\n1:34:55.580 --> 1:34:59.580\n They, you know, there's no end to up, which is one of my favorite expressions.\n\n1:34:59.580 --> 1:35:00.580\n No end to up.\n\n1:35:00.580 --> 1:35:01.580\n No end to up.\n\n1:35:01.580 --> 1:35:02.580\n There's no end to up.\n\n1:35:02.580 --> 1:35:03.580\n Can we dissect that?\n\n1:35:03.580 --> 1:35:04.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:05.580\n From a Randian perspective.\n\n1:35:05.580 --> 1:35:08.620\n There's no end to up, which is, uh, you just keep going.\n\n1:35:08.620 --> 1:35:09.620\n It's never enough.\n\n1:35:09.620 --> 1:35:10.620\n Oh, never enough.\n\n1:35:10.620 --> 1:35:11.620\n Oh, it's never enough.\n\n1:35:11.620 --> 1:35:12.620\n No end to up.\n\n1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:13.620\n No end to up more.\n\n1:35:13.620 --> 1:35:16.060\n And you know, you have to reconcile your fact that you're going to die.\n\n1:35:16.060 --> 1:35:25.540\n So like this no end up thing is that balance is, is just as valuable as progress.\n\n1:35:25.540 --> 1:35:30.780\n So we have to reconcile those two things and put them on a seesaw and figure out how to\n\n1:35:30.780 --> 1:35:34.260\n get two people who have the equal weight to keep it like that.\n\n1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:35.260\n And that's the goal.\n\n1:35:35.260 --> 1:35:38.780\n And it constantly vacillates, uh, according to the time you sometimes you need a little\n\n1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:39.780\n more socialism.\n\n1:35:39.780 --> 1:35:40.860\n Sometimes you need a little more capitalism.\n\n1:35:40.860 --> 1:35:43.340\n You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fly the plane, man.\n\n1:35:43.340 --> 1:35:45.060\n You gotta fly the plane, dude.\n\n1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:52.300\n What's your, um, looking back at history, is there a moment, time period in history,\n\n1:35:52.300 --> 1:35:54.940\n a person in history that's most fascinating to you?\n\n1:35:54.940 --> 1:35:57.980\n You mentioned Bernie Madoff, maybe second to Bernie Madoff.\n\n1:35:57.980 --> 1:36:01.620\n Is there in a battle of Crete, is there something that you've always been curious about?\n\n1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:04.860\n Even if it's something you haven't actually researched that well yet, just something that\n\n1:36:04.860 --> 1:36:09.100\n pulled at your curiosity that, uh, instructed the way you think about the world.\n\n1:36:09.100 --> 1:36:15.660\n An individual or an event or an event, individual, uh, you know, yeah.\n\n1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:18.700\n Moment in history or a person in history.\n\n1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:25.980\n Um, there's a few, but, uh, you know, queen Elizabeth, uh, the Elizabethan era, you know,\n\n1:36:25.980 --> 1:36:33.420\n the sun never sets in the British empire, very successful empire, uh, what an absolute\n\n1:36:33.420 --> 1:36:40.220\n success story that is, is for a leader and a woman, um, can you tell a little bit about\n\n1:36:40.220 --> 1:36:41.220\n her story?\n\n1:36:41.220 --> 1:36:42.220\n I actually don't know much about the British empire.\n\n1:36:42.220 --> 1:36:43.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:43.220 --> 1:36:44.220\n She had a good run.\n\n1:36:44.220 --> 1:36:47.500\n I think it's like 70 years, you know, as a Shakespeare, they, you know, the, oh, I guess\n\n1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:52.580\n what's the word, Pax Romana, the, the, uh, the period of Rome that it was at peace and\n\n1:36:52.580 --> 1:36:56.380\n they flourished like a couple of emperors like Trajan or some good ones.\n\n1:36:56.380 --> 1:37:00.260\n And I think he was part of the Pax Romana that sort of just a peace and a comfortable\n\n1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:06.420\n flourishing time and England, uh, had sort of that in their empire under her successful\n\n1:37:06.420 --> 1:37:07.420\n reign.\n\n1:37:07.420 --> 1:37:08.420\n She murdered her cousin.\n\n1:37:08.420 --> 1:37:12.420\n She, you know, the movies, there's, uh, you know, um, Kate Blanchett plays her and, and\n\n1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:13.500\n does so.\n\n1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:18.420\n And she didn't win the Oscar because fucking Gwyneth Paltrow put a, put a British accent\n\n1:37:18.420 --> 1:37:19.660\n on in Shakespeare in love.\n\n1:37:19.660 --> 1:37:20.660\n It's a tragedy.\n\n1:37:20.660 --> 1:37:21.660\n Why do I know this?\n\n1:37:21.660 --> 1:37:22.660\n Because I'm not a full man.\n\n1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:27.980\n I'm a comedian, which means I do skits and I perform, um, and I, uh, Kate Blanchett's\n\n1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:30.020\n incredible actress at great movies.\n\n1:37:30.020 --> 1:37:34.260\n She was just so, and here's the thing, she, she never got married.\n\n1:37:34.260 --> 1:37:42.620\n She was, she was so, um, astute at public relations and, and, and, and imagine how strong\n\n1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:47.860\n you got to be as a woman to lead the greatest empire maybe known to man at the time and\n\n1:37:47.860 --> 1:37:50.180\n to do so, so successfully.\n\n1:37:50.180 --> 1:37:54.020\n How Machiavellian you have to be, how idealist you have to be, how much of a good marketer\n\n1:37:54.020 --> 1:37:55.020\n you have to be.\n\n1:37:55.020 --> 1:37:56.400\n Propaganda machine was on point.\n\n1:37:56.400 --> 1:37:58.180\n She was married to England.\n\n1:37:58.180 --> 1:38:01.460\n She was adored the way she adorned herself.\n\n1:38:01.460 --> 1:38:04.780\n You walked in, you're like, holy men, God just walked in here.\n\n1:38:04.780 --> 1:38:06.100\n And of course she got fucked.\n\n1:38:06.100 --> 1:38:07.600\n I mean, who doesn't fuck?\n\n1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:08.820\n We all fuck.\n\n1:38:08.820 --> 1:38:10.660\n Even robots one day will fuck.\n\n1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:16.880\n But she was, she, she did that propaganda thing and historians aren't, uh, haven't,\n\n1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:20.440\n they haven't decided this, but I believe she fucked.\n\n1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:24.940\n And I believe she did that as a tool of propaganda.\n\n1:38:24.940 --> 1:38:26.340\n I'm married to England.\n\n1:38:26.340 --> 1:38:31.180\n So you, oh, you're, you're directly referring to like using sex as a way to manipulate people.\n\n1:38:31.180 --> 1:38:35.860\n Well, she, her, she was known as like the, the Virgin queen.\n\n1:38:35.860 --> 1:38:37.940\n And uh, and her thing was like, I'm married to England.\n\n1:38:37.940 --> 1:38:40.900\n Like I can't be distracted by man or woman, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:38:40.900 --> 1:38:42.260\n She never had any kids, nothing.\n\n1:38:42.260 --> 1:38:49.260\n I think she did that as a tool of manipulation, which you need.\n\n1:38:49.260 --> 1:38:53.420\n Rulers need to, you know, Obama made you feel good and then he went and bombed, carpet bombed\n\n1:38:53.420 --> 1:38:54.420\n everywhere.\n\n1:38:54.420 --> 1:38:58.220\n You need to feel good about your guy, no matter how evil they are.\n\n1:38:58.220 --> 1:39:00.380\n And she was fucking a dictator.\n\n1:39:00.380 --> 1:39:03.700\n But when you look back at her, everyone's like, oh my God, she was so great.\n\n1:39:03.700 --> 1:39:08.240\n The horror and the shit that she had to do, she didn't put that in the history books,\n\n1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:11.980\n but that's what probably was part of what made her successful.\n\n1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:17.360\n And um, she's a fascinating character to, to ponder because she was so successful and,\n\n1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:20.200\n and England flourished so much.\n\n1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:23.460\n And it's just fascinating to me because she was the great Virgin queen.\n\n1:39:23.460 --> 1:39:28.660\n And can you think of, there's no other woman who was that, I mean, Angela Merkel, I mean,\n\n1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:29.660\n come on.\n\n1:39:29.660 --> 1:39:33.940\n I mean, there's nobody who comes close and defeating the Spanish Armada, I think that\n\n1:39:33.940 --> 1:39:34.940\n happened under her.\n\n1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:39.500\n I mean, I'm no professional, but I mean, the, the woman crushed.\n\n1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:40.500\n And uh,\n\n1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:44.180\n Do you think it's more effective to lead by love, which just sounds like what she did\n\n1:39:44.180 --> 1:39:46.380\n from the PR perspective or by fear?\n\n1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:48.100\n Where do you, where do you land on that?\n\n1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:49.100\n That's a great question.\n\n1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:52.100\n Um, I'm not, we got to ask Joe.\n\n1:39:52.100 --> 1:39:58.100\n Well, yeah, this is interesting cause I think leading in the 21st century in whatever ways\n\n1:39:58.100 --> 1:39:59.380\n is different.\n\n1:39:59.380 --> 1:40:01.580\n I think it's very difficult to lead by fear.\n\n1:40:01.580 --> 1:40:08.900\n I mean, um, that's why I find Putin fascinating and like really fascinating.\n\n1:40:08.900 --> 1:40:14.260\n Like is he a relic of another era or is he something that will still be necessary in\n\n1:40:14.260 --> 1:40:16.500\n the coming decades for certain nations?\n\n1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:19.780\n I think he's a, I don't think he's a relic from another era.\n\n1:40:19.780 --> 1:40:23.980\n I think his background, I think he is who you think he is because his background was\n\n1:40:23.980 --> 1:40:25.460\n in espionage.\n\n1:40:25.460 --> 1:40:28.340\n His background was in subterfuge and espionage.\n\n1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:33.620\n I think I've said the word subterfuge maybe 10 times now, but he, uh, like big words,\n\n1:40:33.620 --> 1:40:34.620\n intellectuals.\n\n1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:35.980\n I just sitting here with you.\n\n1:40:35.980 --> 1:40:37.820\n It's my, it's time to flex.\n\n1:40:37.820 --> 1:40:41.140\n Um, but he, um, he's very good at that, right?\n\n1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:45.660\n Like, uh, controlling people with psychology and even if you look at the way he sort of\n\n1:40:45.660 --> 1:40:51.980\n used the internet and, um, has sort of been, you know, gotten in to the citizens of other\n\n1:40:51.980 --> 1:40:56.660\n countries opinions and it's very KGB.\n\n1:40:56.660 --> 1:41:00.980\n He also looks great without a shirt on a pony on a horse on a horse.\n\n1:41:00.980 --> 1:41:01.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:02.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:06.380\n I thought he would choose a pony cause a pony smaller makes him would, uh, would you, would\n\n1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:09.500\n you put queen Elizabeth as the greatest leader of all time?\n\n1:41:09.500 --> 1:41:10.500\n Probably.\n\n1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:11.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:16.420\n If you look at Elizabeth as a woman and you look at, uh, you look at the, the length of\n\n1:41:16.420 --> 1:41:21.080\n the reign, I think it's like 70 something years or something like that, that she reigned\n\n1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:23.300\n success man, success.\n\n1:41:23.300 --> 1:41:28.580\n She used the church, she used public psychology, Shakespeare, the greatest playwright of all\n\n1:41:28.580 --> 1:41:34.460\n time, uh, under her reign, you know, people were going to plays and, and, uh, it was a,\n\n1:41:34.460 --> 1:41:40.140\n it was a success front and she was marauding everywhere else marauding and culling resources\n\n1:41:40.140 --> 1:41:44.540\n for the empire and just say a absolute successful.\n\n1:41:44.540 --> 1:41:46.940\n It's even, uh, a token of her success.\n\n1:41:46.940 --> 1:41:48.580\n We don't consider her a dictator.\n\n1:41:48.580 --> 1:41:49.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:49.580 --> 1:41:51.660\n She's a dictator, you know, she was queen.\n\n1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:55.500\n I, this is my thing I love about the feudal system that these fucking countries still\n\n1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:56.620\n have feudal systems.\n\n1:41:56.620 --> 1:42:03.360\n They're celebrating a horrible thing, divine right of Kings oppression, Kings were dictators\n\n1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:05.380\n and now they have fucking ceremonial.\n\n1:42:05.380 --> 1:42:07.780\n Why don't we have a ceremonial Fuhrer?\n\n1:42:07.780 --> 1:42:08.780\n What is in German?\n\n1:42:08.780 --> 1:42:09.780\n He doesn't do any of the bad stuff.\n\n1:42:09.780 --> 1:42:13.220\n He just rolls around and does, I mean, it's like, what the fuck?\n\n1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:15.860\n There's no difference between a Hitler and a fucking King.\n\n1:42:15.860 --> 1:42:17.780\n They did the same horrible shit.\n\n1:42:17.780 --> 1:42:22.100\n Why not a fucking ceremonial conqueror, Alexander the Great walks in, rapes a little bit, but\n\n1:42:22.100 --> 1:42:23.100\n it's all fun.\n\n1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:24.100\n It's for ceremony.\n\n1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:25.100\n He represents the country.\n\n1:42:25.100 --> 1:42:26.820\n Macedonia is Greek.\n\n1:42:26.820 --> 1:42:32.900\n It's interesting to see that, uh, some you're starting to see a bit of that in Russia was\n\n1:42:32.900 --> 1:42:40.180\n Stalin, actually the celebration of a, of a man that helped win the great patriotic war.\n\n1:42:40.180 --> 1:42:41.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:41.180 --> 1:42:42.180\n Right.\n\n1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:44.940\n So like you, you're already starting to see that it's very possible in history books,\n\n1:42:44.940 --> 1:42:50.100\n you'll be seen as maybe like a Genghis Khan type of character and you forget the millions\n\n1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:51.860\n that he tortured.\n\n1:42:51.860 --> 1:42:55.620\n So you're one of the most successful and brilliant people the world has ever seen.\n\n1:42:55.620 --> 1:42:59.660\n So you're the good person to ask, uh, for advice.\n\n1:42:59.660 --> 1:43:04.300\n You know, there's a lot of young people that look up to you, uh, God bless their souls\n\n1:43:04.300 --> 1:43:05.300\n and hearts.\n\n1:43:05.300 --> 1:43:06.700\n Made the right choice.\n\n1:43:06.700 --> 1:43:08.820\n What advice would you give to a young person?\n\n1:43:08.820 --> 1:43:14.720\n Maybe to yourself, to a young version of yourself, you know, and just how to live a successful,\n\n1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:16.560\n a good life.\n\n1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:18.220\n Be doggedly you.\n\n1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:25.140\n I think the magic happens when you are stubbornly doggedly you and you meet other people who\n\n1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:30.540\n are doing the same and, um, the real magic of life, the real true currency in this ephemeral\n\n1:43:30.540 --> 1:43:35.700\n life is sort of the communication that happens between people.\n\n1:43:35.700 --> 1:43:40.620\n Uh, that's the real currency, friendships, love, it's, it's cliche, but it's a, I think\n\n1:43:40.620 --> 1:43:45.300\n the meaning of life is to experience, to experience love.\n\n1:43:45.300 --> 1:43:49.220\n And, uh, I think, uh, people often mistake, maybe it's because of Hollywood films and\n\n1:43:49.220 --> 1:43:54.860\n things like that, that love is a feeling, but it's not, it's an action.\n\n1:43:54.860 --> 1:43:59.380\n So, uh, that took me a while to learn and I think that's why I've made decisions since\n\n1:43:59.380 --> 1:44:01.860\n that I think have been good for me and healthy for me.\n\n1:44:01.860 --> 1:44:03.380\n Love is an action.\n\n1:44:03.380 --> 1:44:08.140\n People can say things, you can feel things, um, that doesn't mean they're necessarily\n\n1:44:08.140 --> 1:44:09.140\n real.\n\n1:44:09.140 --> 1:44:10.260\n It's all chemical reactions.\n\n1:44:10.260 --> 1:44:17.180\n It's all, um, tied to our immaturity and, uh, psychological issues and, uh, survival,\n\n1:44:17.180 --> 1:44:24.100\n but action when some, when you do things, when you act out of love and you, the, that's,\n\n1:44:24.100 --> 1:44:25.300\n that's what it's about.\n\n1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:31.380\n Is there, uh, times when you were younger where you were kind of dishonest with who\n\n1:44:31.380 --> 1:44:36.700\n you are to yourself in terms of like, what, what kind of things did you have to do to,\n\n1:44:36.700 --> 1:44:41.900\n to shake yourself up and be like, okay, I thought, um, I thought I'm going to be a scientist,\n\n1:44:41.900 --> 1:44:44.180\n but instead I realized I'm going to do this.\n\n1:44:44.180 --> 1:44:45.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:45.180 --> 1:44:46.180\n My parents were funny.\n\n1:44:46.180 --> 1:44:47.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:47.180 --> 1:44:50.580\n My, my comedy is a hard, hard thing to explain to, uh, you know, an immigrant mother who\n\n1:44:50.580 --> 1:44:55.540\n came here and under Nazi occupied Crete and became a human rights lawyer and lawyer.\n\n1:44:55.540 --> 1:44:59.460\n And, uh, my brother's a lawyer and my father was a lawyer, you know, clawed his way up.\n\n1:44:59.460 --> 1:45:04.140\n His dad was a, was a, um, so your disappointment, um, the black sheep.\n\n1:45:04.140 --> 1:45:05.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:05.140 --> 1:45:11.820\n My brother went to Oxford Georgetown law at Brown, you know, has a master's in pot, you\n\n1:45:11.820 --> 1:45:13.020\n know, law degrees.\n\n1:45:13.020 --> 1:45:17.580\n My mother has followed up for law degrees, uh, you know, uh, she was on the human rights\n\n1:45:17.580 --> 1:45:22.700\n commission in New York up for a judgeship under Dinkins, um, wrote a, you know, um,\n\n1:45:22.700 --> 1:45:24.740\n she was the editor of Unitar.\n\n1:45:24.740 --> 1:45:27.940\n She wrote a seminal piece on the human rights of children for the United Nations.\n\n1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:30.260\n Um, and, uh, yeah, it was a comedian.\n\n1:45:30.260 --> 1:45:31.540\n I was always a fuck up.\n\n1:45:31.540 --> 1:45:35.780\n And, uh, the thing that I was best at, the only thing I was ever decent at was just like\n\n1:45:35.780 --> 1:45:36.780\n making people laugh.\n\n1:45:36.780 --> 1:45:37.780\n I don't know why.\n\n1:45:37.780 --> 1:45:41.660\n I don't know where that comes from, but, uh, was there ever a question or did, was there\n\n1:45:41.660 --> 1:45:44.020\n a moment where you decided this is what I'm going to do?\n\n1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:45.900\n There was a moment after I graduated college.\n\n1:45:45.900 --> 1:45:46.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:46.900 --> 1:45:51.020\n I was just thinking about all types of stuff that other people imposed on me.\n\n1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:55.180\n And, um, I was honest with myself and once I figured out it was an actual career path,\n\n1:45:55.180 --> 1:46:00.220\n I wasn't even aware back then the internet wasn't huge, you know, late 99, 2000 it wasn't\n\n1:46:00.220 --> 1:46:01.220\n big yet.\n\n1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:02.980\n So I didn't, I thought Robin Williams was just like an actor.\n\n1:46:02.980 --> 1:46:04.980\n I didn't know there was comedy clubs and all.\n\n1:46:04.980 --> 1:46:07.820\n So once I learned that I was just like, I tried it.\n\n1:46:07.820 --> 1:46:09.900\n I suffer from massive anxiety.\n\n1:46:09.900 --> 1:46:12.340\n I remember the first time I did comedy, my arms went numb.\n\n1:46:12.340 --> 1:46:14.220\n I started having a massive panic attack.\n\n1:46:14.220 --> 1:46:15.300\n I have my first set.\n\n1:46:15.300 --> 1:46:16.300\n I can show it to you.\n\n1:46:16.300 --> 1:46:17.860\n I suggest I just come video.\n\n1:46:17.860 --> 1:46:18.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:18.860 --> 1:46:19.860\n I'm video.\n\n1:46:19.860 --> 1:46:20.860\n Thank you.\n\n1:46:20.860 --> 1:46:21.860\n Thank you.\n\n1:46:21.860 --> 1:46:22.860\n Thank you.\n\n1:46:22.860 --> 1:46:23.860\n And the reason why I kept saying thank you is because I forgot my old jokes.\n\n1:46:23.860 --> 1:46:24.860\n I was so scared.\n\n1:46:24.860 --> 1:46:26.740\n And then they laughed because of the amount of times I said thank you.\n\n1:46:26.740 --> 1:46:31.300\n And then once they laughed, I was, I remembered the whole thing and I did the five minutes\n\n1:46:31.300 --> 1:46:32.500\n and I remember getting off.\n\n1:46:32.500 --> 1:46:37.360\n And for a person who never felt like he had a place anywhere, nothing ever felt right.\n\n1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:39.580\n That felt like, okay, I found it.\n\n1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:41.220\n This is what I'm supposed to do.\n\n1:46:41.220 --> 1:46:42.220\n This is it.\n\n1:46:42.220 --> 1:46:45.260\n It was the only time in my life I felt that I haven't felt that sense.\n\n1:46:45.260 --> 1:46:46.660\n Never felt it before.\n\n1:46:46.660 --> 1:46:48.600\n So that's the only thing I can do.\n\n1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:53.500\n And yeah, I had that, you know, it's funny cause there's a similar experience like immigrant\n\n1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:59.500\n family and the world tells you to do certain things and you think that's right, but, but\n\n1:46:59.500 --> 1:47:07.860\n then you put yourself in situations by luck probably where it's like, oh, this, this,\n\n1:47:07.860 --> 1:47:08.940\n this feels right.\n\n1:47:08.940 --> 1:47:11.220\n I don't know what this means, but this feels right.\n\n1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:17.300\n I think the biggest moment like that for me was, I don't know what to make of it exactly,\n\n1:47:17.300 --> 1:47:23.980\n but when I met Spot, the robot, the legged robot, it was like five years ago, it felt\n\n1:47:23.980 --> 1:47:31.540\n like this, the depth of fascinating ideas that are yet to be explored with this thing.\n\n1:47:31.540 --> 1:47:32.540\n This felt like a journey.\n\n1:47:32.540 --> 1:47:38.140\n It was like a door that opened and I was like, I don't want to be a professor.\n\n1:47:38.140 --> 1:47:43.260\n At that point I realized I don't want to do sort of a generic stuff.\n\n1:47:43.260 --> 1:47:44.940\n I want to do something crazy.\n\n1:47:44.940 --> 1:47:46.820\n I want to do something big.\n\n1:47:46.820 --> 1:47:48.620\n That's the reason I stepped away from MIT.\n\n1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:51.800\n That's the reason I have this burning desire to do a startup.\n\n1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:53.060\n That's the reason I came to Austin.\n\n1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:54.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:54.060 --> 1:47:57.660\n I don't know what the hell it all means, but you just kind of follow that.\n\n1:47:57.660 --> 1:47:58.660\n That's awesome.\n\n1:47:58.660 --> 1:48:00.360\n That sounds like you're following what's doggedly you.\n\n1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:06.760\n And also I think I just to, just to piggyback off it, I think that means no matter what\n\n1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:12.100\n it is, because I think our, the American dream is sold like, Hey, if you're not Beyonce or\n\n1:48:12.100 --> 1:48:14.100\n if you're not famous, you're not worth it.\n\n1:48:14.100 --> 1:48:15.300\n I hate that.\n\n1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:19.560\n And that's what I love so much about certain countries like Sweden, it's like where everyone\n\n1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:22.560\n has healthcare and stuff like that because everyone's a little is valued more.\n\n1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:26.780\n It's like whatever, if you want to be a doorman, do it like it's all the same.\n\n1:48:26.780 --> 1:48:28.280\n Prince was not happy.\n\n1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:33.160\n There's no, just because you're rich or famous, you're still the same guy with your possessions\n\n1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:34.860\n are a lot little, you know?\n\n1:48:34.860 --> 1:48:37.380\n It's like, I have met some doormen.\n\n1:48:37.380 --> 1:48:42.020\n I have met some tax cappers that I lie to you not are more fascinating.\n\n1:48:42.020 --> 1:48:47.060\n I have comedians are horrible people, so I want to get away from all of them.\n\n1:48:47.060 --> 1:48:52.540\n I have very few friends, Paul Verzi, Tim Dillon, who are comedians because they're awful, awful\n\n1:48:52.540 --> 1:48:53.540\n people.\n\n1:48:53.540 --> 1:48:58.300\n Some of the people who you know the most, who are the most famous are not who they say\n\n1:48:58.300 --> 1:48:59.300\n they are.\n\n1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:00.300\n Usually that's the case.\n\n1:49:00.300 --> 1:49:04.660\n They're putting on that public facade because they're fucking sociopaths and they're horrible\n\n1:49:04.660 --> 1:49:08.220\n people and some of the most beautiful people I've met and the most interesting people I've\n\n1:49:08.220 --> 1:49:10.020\n met have regular jobs.\n\n1:49:10.020 --> 1:49:13.380\n There is no shame in any fucking job.\n\n1:49:13.380 --> 1:49:16.340\n We don't all have to be rappers with like rims.\n\n1:49:16.340 --> 1:49:17.340\n It's just a weird thing.\n\n1:49:17.340 --> 1:49:18.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:18.340 --> 1:49:22.340\n Fame is a drug and yeah, comedians, I agree with you.\n\n1:49:22.340 --> 1:49:28.460\n There's some part of me that knows that there'll be a moment in my life when I'm standing there\n\n1:49:28.460 --> 1:49:37.860\n with like a sword or a knife in my stomach and looking at Tim Dillon's smiling face saying\n\n1:49:37.860 --> 1:49:41.820\n you shouldn't have trusted me, you stupid fuck.\n\n1:49:41.820 --> 1:49:46.180\n So on that note, Yannis, I've been a huge fan of yours.\n\n1:49:46.180 -->

chemistry you have with yourself\n\n1:49:56.540 --> 1:49:57.540\n is also fun to watch.\n\n1:49:57.540 --> 1:49:58.540\n So man, I'm a huge fan.\n\n1:49:58.540 --> 1:50:00.860\n It's a huge honor that you come down here.\n\n1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:01.860\n Thanks so much for talking to me.\n\n1:50:01.860 --> 1:50:03.380\n It means so much to me to hear you say that.\n\n1:50:03.380 --> 1:50:04.380\n I really appreciate it.\n\n1:50:04.380 --> 1:50:07.420\n I'm a big fan of yours and having me on has been amazing and just thank you, man.\n\n1:50:07.420 --> 1:50:10.740\n Thank you for having me on and people, if they want to watch my special, it's called\n\n1:50:10.740 --> 1:50:11.740\n Blowing the Light.\n\n1:50:11.740 --> 1:50:15.220\n It's on YouTube and please come listen to Long Days of Podcasts and let's go eat some\n\n1:50:15.220 --> 1:50:16.220\n barbecue.\n\n1:50:16.220 --> 1:50:17.380\n Let's do it.\n\n1:50:17.380 --> 1:50:22.620\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with

podcast.\n\n1:50:29.100 --> 1:50:32.980\n And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.\n\n1:50:32.980 --> 1:50:37.180\n Revolutions are the locomotives of history.\n\n1:50:37.180 --> 1:50:56.460\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
