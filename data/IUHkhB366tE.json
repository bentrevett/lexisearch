James Gates, Jr.\n\n00:03.800 --> 00:07.300\n He's a theoretical physicist and professor at Brown University,\n\n00:07.300 --> 00:11.460\n working on supersymmetry, supergravity, and superstring theory.\n\n00:11.460 --> 00:16.500\n He served on former President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,\n\n00:16.500 --> 00:21.600\n and he's now the coauthor of a new book titled Proving Einstein Right,\n\n00:21.600 --> 00:26.500\n about the scientists who set out to prove Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\n00:26.500 --> 00:30.200\n You may have noticed that I've been speaking with not just computer scientists,\n\n00:30.200 --> 00:35.200\n but philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, economists, and soon, much more.\n\n00:35.200 --> 00:39.300\n To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.\n\n00:39.300 --> 00:43.000\n It is our civilization's journey into understanding the human mind\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:45.700\n and creating echoes of it in the machine.\n\n00:45.700 --> 00:50.300\n That journey includes, of course, the world of theoretical physics\n\n00:50.300 --> 00:53.300\n and its practice of first principles mathematical thinking\n\n00:53.300 --> 00:57.500\n and exploring the fundamental nature of our reality.\n\n00:57.500 --> 01:00.500\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:00.500 --> 01:04.600\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n01:04.600 --> 01:07.300\n follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,\n\n01:07.300 --> 01:13.400\n or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F.R.I.D.M.A.N.\n\n01:13.400 --> 01:17.100\n If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts or YouTube or Twitter,\n\n01:17.100 --> 01:20.500\n consider mentioning ideas, people, topics you find interesting.\n\n01:20.500 --> 01:23.100\n It helps guide the future of this podcast.\n\n01:23.100 --> 01:28.600\n But in general, I just love comments that are full of kindness and thoughtfulness in them.\n\n01:28.600 --> 01:32.800\n This podcast is a side project for me, but I still put a lot of effort into it.\n\n01:32.800 --> 01:39.600\n So the positive words of support from an amazing community, from you, really help.\n\n01:39.600 --> 01:42.500\n I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.\n\n01:42.500 --> 01:45.100\n I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode\n\n01:45.100 --> 01:48.900\n and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:48.900 --> 01:52.600\n I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n01:52.600 --> 01:56.400\n I provide timestamps for the start of the conversations you may have noticed\n\n01:56.400 --> 02:00.100\n that you can skip to, but it helps if you listen to the ad\n\n02:00.100 --> 02:05.300\n and support this podcast by trying out the product or service being advertised.\n\n02:05.300 --> 02:10.100\n This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n02:10.100 --> 02:12.500\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n02:12.500 --> 02:16.800\n but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.\n\n02:16.800 --> 02:19.700\n Cash App also has a new investing feature.\n\n02:19.700 --> 02:25.200\n You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.\n\n02:25.200 --> 02:28.100\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n02:28.100 --> 02:31.100\n a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.\n\n02:31.100 --> 02:33.100\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n02:33.100 --> 02:36.200\n to support one of my favorite organizations called First,\n\n02:36.200 --> 02:39.600\n best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.\n\n02:39.600 --> 02:43.100\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n02:43.100 --> 02:47.300\n in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,\n\n02:47.300 --> 02:51.200\n which means the donated money is used to maximum effectiveness.\n\n02:51.200 --> 02:54.000\n When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:57.700\n and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,\n\n02:57.700 --> 03:00.600\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,\n\n03:00.600 --> 03:05.400\n which again is an organization that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys\n\n03:05.400 --> 03:08.400\n to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n03:08.400 --> 03:13.600\n And now, here's my conversation with S. James Gates Jr.\n\n03:13.600 --> 03:15.500\n You tell a story when you were eight.\n\n03:15.500 --> 03:18.200\n You had a profound realization that the stars in the sky\n\n03:18.200 --> 03:22.500\n are actually places that we could travel to one day.\n\n03:22.500 --> 03:27.200\n Do you think human beings will ever venture outside our solar system?\n\n03:27.200 --> 03:30.500\n Wow, the question of whether humanity gets outside of the solar system.\n\n03:30.500 --> 03:31.800\n It's going to be a challenge,\n\n03:31.800 --> 03:38.300\n and as long as the laws of physics that we have today are accurate and valid,\n\n03:38.300 --> 03:40.800\n it's going to be extraordinarily difficult.\n\n03:40.800 --> 03:43.400\n I'm a science fiction fan, as you probably know,\n\n03:43.400 --> 03:48.100\n so I love to dream of starships and traveling to other solar systems,\n\n03:48.100 --> 03:52.500\n but the barriers are just formidable.\n\n03:52.500 --> 03:55.300\n If we just kind of venture a little bit into science fiction,\n\n03:55.300 --> 03:58.100\n do you think the spaceships, if we are successful,\n\n03:58.100 --> 04:00.400\n that take us outside the solar system,\n\n04:00.400 --> 04:03.000\n will look like the ones we have today,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.500\n or are fundamental breakthroughs necessary?\n\n04:07.500 --> 04:10.100\n In order to have genuine starships,\n\n04:10.100 --> 04:14.900\n probably some really radical views about the way the universe works\n\n04:14.900 --> 04:17.900\n are going to have to take place in our science.\n\n04:17.900 --> 04:22.200\n We could, with our current technology,\n\n04:22.200 --> 04:25.500\n think about constructing multigenerational starships\n\n04:25.500 --> 04:31.200\n where the people who get on them are not the people who get off at the other end.\n\n04:31.200 --> 04:36.500\n But even if we do that, the formidable problem is actually our bodies,\n\n04:36.500 --> 04:41.100\n which doesn't seem to be conscious for a lot of people.\n\n04:41.100 --> 04:44.000\n Even getting to Mars is going to present this challenge,\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.300\n because we live in this wonderful home,\n\n04:47.300 --> 04:50.700\n has a protective magnetic magnetosphere around it,\n\n04:50.700 --> 04:54.100\n and so we're shielded from cosmic radiation.\n\n04:54.100 --> 04:58.800\n Once you leave this shield, there are some estimates that,\n\n04:58.800 --> 05:02.100\n for example, if you sent someone to Mars,\n\n05:02.100 --> 05:05.700\n with our technology, probably about two years out there without the shield,\n\n05:05.700 --> 05:07.000\n they're going to be bombarded.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.200\n That means radiation, probably means cancer.\n\n05:10.200 --> 05:12.900\n So that's one of the most formidable challenges,\n\n05:12.900 --> 05:16.300\n even if we could get over the technology.\n\n05:16.300 --> 05:19.300\n Do you think, so Mars is a harsh place.\n\n05:19.300 --> 05:22.800\n Elon Musk, SpaceX and other folks,\n\n05:22.800 --> 05:25.900\n NASA are really pushing to put a human being on Mars.\n\n05:25.900 --> 05:28.500\n Do you think, again, let's forgive me\n\n05:28.500 --> 05:31.300\n for lingering in science fiction land for a little bit.\n\n05:31.300 --> 05:34.400\n Do you think one day we may be able to colonize Mars?\n\n05:34.400 --> 05:37.800\n First, do you think we'll put a human on Mars,\n\n05:37.800 --> 05:40.700\n and then do you think we'll put many humans on Mars?\n\n05:40.700 --> 05:45.500\n So first of all, I am extraordinarily convinced\n\n05:45.500 --> 05:48.100\n we will not put a human on Mars by 2030,\n\n05:48.100 --> 05:52.100\n which is a date that you often hear in the public debate.\n\n05:52.100 --> 05:53.500\n What's the challenge there?\n\n05:53.500 --> 05:54.300\n What do you think?\n\n05:54.300 --> 05:56.600\n So there are a couple of ways that I could slice this,\n\n05:56.600 --> 06:01.000\n but the one that I think is simplest for people to understand involves money.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.500\n So you look at how we got to the moon in the 1960s.\n\n06:05.500 --> 06:07.100\n It was about 10 year duration\n\n06:07.100 --> 06:10.300\n between the challenge that President Kennedy laid out\n\n06:10.300 --> 06:12.700\n and our successfully landing a moon.\n\n06:12.700 --> 06:14.400\n I was actually here at MIT\n\n06:14.400 --> 06:16.600\n when that first moon landing occurred,\n\n06:16.600 --> 06:18.300\n so I remember watching it on TV.\n\n06:18.300 --> 06:19.200\n But how did we get there?\n\n06:19.200 --> 06:24.700\n Well, we had this extraordinarily technical agency\n\n06:24.700 --> 06:26.900\n of the United States government, NASA.\n\n06:26.900 --> 06:32.700\n It consumed about 5% of the country's economic output.\n\n06:32.700 --> 06:35.800\n And so you say 5% of the economic output\n\n06:35.800 --> 06:40.400\n over about a 10 year period gets us 250,000 miles in space.\n\n06:40.400 --> 06:43.500\n Mars is about a hundred times farther.\n\n06:43.500 --> 06:45.500\n So you have at least a hundred times the challenge\n\n06:45.500 --> 06:48.600\n and we're spending about one tenth of the funds\n\n06:48.600 --> 06:50.800\n that we spent then as a government.\n\n06:50.800 --> 06:54.400\n So my claim is that it's at least a thousand times harder\n\n06:54.400 --> 06:58.000\n for me to imagine us getting to Mars by 2030.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.400\n And he had that part that you mentioned in the speech\n\n07:00.400 --> 07:03.900\n that I just have to throw in there of JFK,\n\n07:03.900 --> 07:06.100\n of we do these things not because they're easy,\n\n07:06.100 --> 07:07.800\n but because they're hard.\n\n07:07.800 --> 07:09.100\n That's such a beautiful line\n\n07:09.100 --> 07:11.900\n that I would love to hear a modern president say\n\n07:11.900 --> 07:13.700\n about a scientific endeavor.\n\n07:13.700 --> 07:16.300\n Well, one day we live and hope\n\n07:16.300 --> 07:19.700\n that such a president will arise for our nation.\n\n07:19.700 --> 07:21.100\n But even if, like I said,\n\n07:21.100 --> 07:24.900\n even if you fix the technical problems,\n\n07:24.900 --> 07:28.900\n the biological engineering that I worry most about,\n\n07:28.900 --> 07:31.900\n however, I'm gonna go out on a limb here.\n\n07:31.900 --> 07:35.800\n I think that by 2090 or so,\n\n07:35.800 --> 07:40.800\n or 2100, should I say 120,\n\n07:41.300 --> 07:44.000\n I suspect we're gonna have a human on Mars.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.400\n Wow, so you think that many years out,\n\n07:46.400 --> 07:48.000\n first a few tangents.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.500\n You said bioengineering is a challenge.\n\n07:50.500 --> 07:52.400\n What's the challenge there?\n\n07:52.400 --> 07:57.400\n So as I said, the real problem with interstellar travel,\n\n07:57.800 --> 08:00.800\n aside from the technology challenges,\n\n08:00.800 --> 08:03.200\n the real problem is radiation.\n\n08:03.200 --> 08:08.200\n And how do you engineer either an environment or a body,\n\n08:08.700 --> 08:12.900\n because we see rapid advances going on in bioengineering,\n\n08:12.900 --> 08:16.400\n how do you engineer either a ship or a body\n\n08:16.400 --> 08:18.900\n so that something, some person\n\n08:18.900 --> 08:22.200\n that's recognizably human will survive\n\n08:22.200 --> 08:24.600\n the rigors of interplanetary space travel?\n\n08:24.600 --> 08:26.500\n It's much more difficult than most people\n\n08:26.500 --> 08:28.200\n seem to take into account.\n\n08:29.500 --> 08:34.500\n So if we could linger on the 2090, 2100, 2120,\n\n08:36.200 --> 08:38.900\n sort of thinking of that kind of,\n\n08:40.100 --> 08:42.900\n you know, and let's linger on money.\n\n08:42.900 --> 08:43.740\n Okay.\n\n08:43.740 --> 08:48.900\n So Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are pushing the cost,\n\n08:48.900 --> 08:50.600\n trying to push the cost down.\n\n08:50.600 --> 08:52.900\n I mean, this is, so do you have hope\n\n08:52.900 --> 08:56.600\n as this actually sort of a brilliant big picture scientist,\n\n08:56.600 --> 09:01.600\n do you think a business entrepreneur can take science\n\n09:02.040 --> 09:04.900\n and make it cheaper and get it out there faster?\n\n09:04.900 --> 09:06.800\n So bending the cost curve is,\n\n09:06.800 --> 09:08.500\n you'll notice that has been an anchor.\n\n09:08.500 --> 09:10.600\n This is the simplest way for me to discuss this with people\n\n09:10.600 --> 09:12.100\n about what the challenge is.\n\n09:12.100 --> 09:16.200\n So yes, bending the cost curve is certainly critical\n\n09:16.200 --> 09:18.200\n if we're going to be successful.\n\n09:18.200 --> 09:22.900\n Now, you asked about the endeavors that are out there now\n\n09:22.900 --> 09:25.300\n sponsored by two very prominent American citizens,\n\n09:25.300 --> 09:28.000\n Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:31.600\n I'm disappointed actually in what I see\n\n09:31.600 --> 09:35.200\n in terms of the routes that are being pursued.\n\n09:35.200 --> 09:36.700\n So let me give you one example there.\n\n09:36.700 --> 09:39.600\n And this one is going to be a little bit more technical.\n\n09:39.600 --> 09:41.400\n So if you look at the kinds of rockets\n\n09:41.400 --> 09:45.100\n that both these organizations are creating,\n\n09:45.100 --> 09:47.300\n yes, it's wonderful, reusable technology\n\n09:47.300 --> 09:50.000\n to see a rocket go up and land on its fins\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:51.800\n just like it did in science fiction movies\n\n09:51.800 --> 09:54.500\n when I was a kid, that's astounding.\n\n09:54.500 --> 09:58.900\n But the real problem is those rockets,\n\n09:58.900 --> 10:00.300\n the technology that we're doing now\n\n10:00.300 --> 10:02.100\n is not really that different\n\n10:02.100 --> 10:04.400\n than what was used to go to the moon.\n\n10:04.400 --> 10:06.600\n And there are alternatives it turns out.\n\n10:06.600 --> 10:09.000\n There's an engine called a flare engine,\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\n which so a traditional rocket,\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.200\n if you look at the engine, it looks like a bell, right?\n\n10:13.200 --> 10:14.900\n And then the flame comes out the bottom.\n\n10:14.900 --> 10:17.300\n But there is a kind of engine called a flare engine,\n\n10:17.300 --> 10:20.200\n which is essentially, when you look at it,\n\n10:20.200 --> 10:23.800\n it looks like an exhaust pipe\n\n10:23.800 --> 10:27.600\n on like a fancy car that's long and elongated.\n\n10:27.600 --> 10:29.000\n And it's a type of rocket engine\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.800\n that we know there've been preliminary testing,\n\n10:32.800 --> 10:34.100\n we know it works.\n\n10:34.100 --> 10:36.700\n And it also is actually much more economical\n\n10:36.700 --> 10:38.700\n because what it does is allow you\n\n10:38.700 --> 10:40.900\n to vary the amount of thrust as you go up.\n\n10:40.900 --> 10:42.200\n In a way that you cannot do\n\n10:42.200 --> 10:44.300\n with one of these bell shaped engines.\n\n10:44.300 --> 10:48.800\n So you would think that an entrepreneur\n\n10:48.800 --> 10:53.500\n might try to have the breakthrough to use flare nozzles,\n\n10:53.500 --> 10:56.600\n as they're called, as a way to bend the cost curve.\n\n10:56.600 --> 10:57.600\n Because as we keep coming back,\n\n10:57.600 --> 10:59.200\n that's gonna be a big factor.\n\n10:59.200 --> 11:00.600\n But that's not happening.\n\n11:00.600 --> 11:04.600\n In fact, what we see is what I think of as incremental change\n\n11:04.600 --> 11:06.200\n in terms of our technology.\n\n11:06.200 --> 11:10.200\n So I'm not really very encouraged by what I personally see.\n\n11:10.200 --> 11:12.500\n So incremental change won't bend the cost curve.\n\n11:12.500 --> 11:14.200\n I don't see it.\n\n11:14.200 --> 11:17.400\n Just linger on the sci fi for one more question.\n\n11:17.400 --> 11:18.900\n Sure.\n\n11:18.900 --> 11:20.900\n Do you think we're alone in the universe?\n\n11:20.900 --> 11:23.800\n Are we the only intelligent form of life?\n\n11:23.800 --> 11:27.000\n So there is a quote by Carl Sagan,\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.300\n which I really love when I hear this question.\n\n11:30.300 --> 11:32.400\n And I recall the quote,\n\n11:32.400 --> 11:34.000\n and it goes something like,\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:38.500\n if we're the only conscious life in the universe,\n\n11:38.500 --> 11:40.800\n it's in a terrible waste of space\n\n11:40.800 --> 11:45.000\n because the universe is an incredibly big place.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.200\n And when Carl made that statement,\n\n11:47.200 --> 11:50.400\n we didn't know about the profusion of planets\n\n11:50.400 --> 11:51.600\n that are out there.\n\n11:51.600 --> 11:53.200\n In the last decade,\n\n11:53.200 --> 11:56.100\n we've discovered over a thousand planets\n\n11:56.100 --> 11:59.600\n and a substantial number of those planets are Earth like\n\n11:59.600 --> 12:04.100\n in terms of being in the Goldilocks zone as it's called.\n\n12:04.100 --> 12:09.100\n So in my mind, it's practically inconceivable\n\n12:09.100 --> 12:13.400\n that we're the only conscious form of life in the universe.\n\n12:13.400 --> 12:15.800\n But that doesn't mean they've come to visit us.\n\n12:15.800 --> 12:17.000\n Do you think they would look,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:21.200\n do you think we'll recognize alien life if we saw it?\n\n12:21.200 --> 12:24.100\n Do you think it'd look anything like the carbon base,\n\n12:24.100 --> 12:27.100\n the biological system we have on Earth today?\n\n12:27.100 --> 12:31.100\n It would depend on that life's native environment\n\n12:31.100 --> 12:32.600\n in which it arose.\n\n12:32.600 --> 12:36.300\n If that environment was sufficiently like our environment,\n\n12:36.300 --> 12:39.200\n there's a principle in biology and nature called convergence,\n\n12:39.200 --> 12:42.300\n which is that even if you have two biological systems\n\n12:42.300 --> 12:44.600\n that are totally separated from each other,\n\n12:44.600 --> 12:46.900\n if they face similar conditions,\n\n12:46.900 --> 12:49.400\n nature tends to converge on solutions.\n\n12:49.400 --> 12:52.000\n And so there might be similarities\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.600\n if this alien life form was born in a place\n\n12:55.600 --> 12:57.800\n that's kind of like this place.\n\n12:57.800 --> 13:00.600\n Physics appears to be quite similar,\n\n13:00.600 --> 13:03.900\n the laws of physics across the entirety of the universe.\n\n13:03.900 --> 13:06.900\n Do you think weirder things than we see on Earth\n\n13:06.900 --> 13:10.300\n can spring up out of the same kinds of laws of physics?\n\n13:10.300 --> 13:12.800\n From the laws of physics, I would say yes.\n\n13:12.800 --> 13:14.500\n First of all, if you look at carbon based life,\n\n13:14.500 --> 13:15.600\n why are we carbon based?\n\n13:15.600 --> 13:18.200\n Well, it turns out it's because of the way\n\n13:18.200 --> 13:20.100\n that carbon interacts with elements,\n\n13:20.100 --> 13:22.200\n which in fact is also a reflection\n\n13:22.200 --> 13:26.600\n on the electronic structure of the carbon nucleus.\n\n13:26.600 --> 13:28.200\n So you can look down the table of elements and say,\n\n13:28.200 --> 13:30.400\n well, gee, do we see similar elements?\n\n13:30.400 --> 13:31.400\n The answer is yes.\n\n13:31.400 --> 13:34.100\n And one that one often hears about\n\n13:34.100 --> 13:36.200\n in science fiction is silicon.\n\n13:36.200 --> 13:38.500\n So maybe there's a silicon based life form out there\n\n13:38.500 --> 13:40.200\n if the conditions are right.\n\n13:40.200 --> 13:41.700\n But I think it's presumptuous of us\n\n13:41.700 --> 13:44.300\n to think that we are the template\n\n13:44.300 --> 13:47.500\n by which all life has to appear.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.900\n Before we dive into beautiful details,\n\n13:52.900 --> 13:55.200\n let me ask a big question.\n\n13:55.200 --> 13:58.200\n What to you is the most beautiful idea,\n\n13:58.200 --> 14:02.000\n maybe the most surprising, mysterious idea in physics?\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.400\n The most surprising idea to me\n\n14:03.400 --> 14:05.700\n is that we can actually do physics.\n\n14:05.700 --> 14:08.800\n The universe did not have to be constructed\n\n14:08.800 --> 14:13.600\n in such a way with our limited intellectual capacity\n\n14:13.600 --> 14:17.600\n that is actually put together in such a way\n\n14:17.600 --> 14:20.200\n and that we are put together in such a way\n\n14:20.200 --> 14:24.200\n that we can, with our mind's eye,\n\n14:24.200 --> 14:27.500\n delve incredibly deeply into the structure of the universe.\n\n14:27.500 --> 14:30.800\n That to me is pretty close to a miracle.\n\n14:30.800 --> 14:34.400\n So there are simple equations, relatively simple,\n\n14:34.400 --> 14:40.000\n that can describe things, the fundamental functions.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.600\n They can describe everything about our reality.\n\n14:42.600 --> 14:46.000\n That's not, can you imagine universes\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.500\n where everything is a lot more complicated?\n\n14:50.500 --> 14:54.800\n Do you think there's something inherent about universes\n\n14:54.800 --> 14:57.600\n that simple laws are...\n\n14:57.600 --> 14:58.900\n Well, first of all, let me,\n\n14:58.900 --> 15:02.200\n this is a question that I encounter in a number of guides.\n\n15:02.200 --> 15:04.200\n A lot of people will raise the question\n\n15:04.200 --> 15:08.000\n about whether mathematics is the language of the universe.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.200\n And my response is mathematics is the language\n\n15:11.200 --> 15:14.700\n that we humans are capable of using in describing the universe.\n\n15:14.700 --> 15:17.300\n It may have little to do with the universe,\n\n15:17.300 --> 15:20.700\n but in terms of our capacity, it's the microscope,\n\n15:20.700 --> 15:22.800\n it's the telescope through which we,\n\n15:22.800 --> 15:26.400\n it's the lens through which we are able to view the universe\n\n15:26.400 --> 15:31.400\n with the precision that no other human language allows.\n\n15:31.400 --> 15:32.900\n So could there be other universes?\n\n15:32.900 --> 15:36.800\n Well, I don't even know if this one looks like I think it does.\n\n15:36.800 --> 15:43.000\n But the beautiful surprising thing is that physics,\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.800\n there are laws of physics, very few laws of physics\n\n15:46.800 --> 15:48.900\n that can effectively compress down\n\n15:48.900 --> 15:50.200\n the functioning of the universe.\n\n15:50.200 --> 15:52.700\n Yes, that's extraordinarily surprising.\n\n15:52.700 --> 15:54.000\n I like to use the analogy\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.800\n with computers and information technology.\n\n15:56.800 --> 16:01.000\n If you worry about transmitting large bundles of data,\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.200\n one of the things that computer scientists do for us\n\n16:03.200 --> 16:06.400\n is they allow for processes that are called compression,\n\n16:06.400 --> 16:07.900\n where you take big packets of data\n\n16:07.900 --> 16:10.300\n and you press them down into much smaller packets,\n\n16:10.300 --> 16:11.400\n and then you transmit those\n\n16:11.400 --> 16:13.400\n and then unpack them at the other end.\n\n16:13.400 --> 16:16.000\n And so it looks a little bit to me\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.500\n like the universe has kind of done us a favor.\n\n16:18.500 --> 16:20.600\n It's constructed our minds in such a way\n\n16:20.600 --> 16:23.100\n that we have this thing called mathematics,\n\n16:23.100 --> 16:24.700\n which then as we look at the universe,\n\n16:24.700 --> 16:29.600\n teaches us how to carry out the compression process.\n\n16:29.600 --> 16:31.600\n A quick question about compression.\n\n16:31.600 --> 16:35.100\n Do you think the human mind can be compressed?\n\n16:35.100 --> 16:38.000\n The biology can be compressed?\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\n We talked about space travel.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.400\n To be able to compress the information\n\n16:42.400 --> 16:46.000\n that captures some large percent of what it means\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:48.700\n to be me or you,\n\n16:48.700 --> 16:52.600\n and then be able to send that at the speed of light.\n\n16:52.600 --> 16:54.300\n Wow, that's a big question.\n\n16:54.300 --> 16:56.900\n And let me try to take it apart,\n\n16:56.900 --> 16:58.900\n unpack it into several pieces.\n\n16:58.900 --> 17:02.700\n I don't believe that wetware biology such as we are\n\n17:02.700 --> 17:08.000\n has an exclusive patent on intellectual consciousness.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.500\n I suspect that other structures in the universe\n\n17:11.500 --> 17:14.700\n are perfectly capable of producing the data streams\n\n17:14.700 --> 17:17.300\n that we use to process, first of all,\n\n17:17.300 --> 17:18.700\n our observations of the universe\n\n17:18.700 --> 17:20.700\n and an awareness of ourself.\n\n17:20.700 --> 17:23.300\n I can imagine other structures can do that also.\n\n17:23.300 --> 17:26.600\n So that's part of what you were talking about,\n\n17:26.600 --> 17:30.500\n which I would have some disagreement with.\n\n17:30.500 --> 17:31.600\n Consciousness.\n\n17:31.600 --> 17:36.200\n What's the most interesting part of us humans?\n\n17:36.200 --> 17:38.000\n Is consciousness the thing?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:39.900\n I think that's the most interesting thing about humans.\n\n17:39.900 --> 17:43.700\n And then you're saying that there's other entities\n\n17:43.700 --> 17:45.100\n throughout the universe.\n\n17:45.100 --> 17:48.200\n I can well imagine that the architecture\n\n17:48.200 --> 17:50.800\n that supports our consciousness, again,\n\n17:50.800 --> 17:53.800\n has no patent on consciousness.\n\n17:53.800 --> 17:57.700\n Just in case you have an interesting thought here,\n\n17:57.700 --> 18:01.500\n there's folks perhaps in philosophy called panpsychists\n\n18:01.500 --> 18:04.100\n that believe consciousness underlies everything.\n\n18:04.100 --> 18:07.000\n It is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.700\n Do you have a sense that that could possibly fit into...\n\n18:09.700 --> 18:12.100\n I don't know the answer to that question.\n\n18:12.100 --> 18:15.800\n One part of that belief system is giya,\n\n18:15.800 --> 18:18.500\n which is that there's a kind of conscious life force\n\n18:18.500 --> 18:20.300\n about our planet.\n\n18:20.300 --> 18:22.800\n And I've encountered these things before.\n\n18:22.800 --> 18:25.200\n I don't quite know what to make of them.\n\n18:25.200 --> 18:30.300\n My own life experience, and I'll be 69 in about two months,\n\n18:30.300 --> 18:33.000\n and I have spent all my adulthood thinking about\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:37.400\n the way that mathematics interacts with nature\n\n18:37.400 --> 18:39.800\n and with us to try to understand nature.\n\n18:39.800 --> 18:43.800\n And all I can tell you from all of my integrated experience\n\n18:43.800 --> 18:47.300\n is that there is something extraordinarily mysterious\n\n18:47.300 --> 18:48.500\n to me about our universe.\n\n18:48.500 --> 18:51.100\n This is something that Einstein said\n\n18:51.100 --> 18:53.300\n from his life experience as a scientist.\n\n18:53.300 --> 18:58.300\n And this mysteriousness almost feels\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:03.300\n like the universe is our parent.\n\n19:03.300 --> 19:07.300\n It's a very strange thing perhaps to hear scientists say,\n\n19:07.300 --> 19:10.100\n but there are just so many strange coincidences\n\n19:10.100 --> 19:13.500\n that you just get a sense that something is going on.\n\n19:14.900 --> 19:16.300\n Well, I interrupted you.\n\n19:16.300 --> 19:19.900\n In terms of compressing what we're down to,\n\n19:19.900 --> 19:21.800\n we can send it at the speed of light.\n\n19:21.800 --> 19:23.300\n Yes.\n\n19:23.300 --> 19:26.800\n So the first thing is I would argue that it's probably\n\n19:26.800 --> 19:30.100\n very likely that artificial intelligence\n\n19:30.100 --> 19:32.600\n ultimately will develop something like consciousness,\n\n19:32.600 --> 19:35.200\n something that for us will probably be indistinguishable\n\n19:35.200 --> 19:36.500\n from consciousness.\n\n19:36.500 --> 19:41.500\n So that's what I meant by our biological processing equipment\n\n19:41.600 --> 19:44.100\n that we carry up here probably does not hold a patent\n\n19:44.100 --> 19:46.200\n on consciousness, because it's really\n\n19:46.200 --> 19:48.100\n about the data streams.\n\n19:48.100 --> 19:49.500\n As far as I can tell, that's what we are.\n\n19:49.500 --> 19:53.700\n We are self actuating, self learning data streams.\n\n19:53.700 --> 19:56.300\n That to me is most accurate way I can tell you\n\n19:56.300 --> 19:59.700\n what I've seen in my lifetime about what humans are\n\n19:59.700 --> 20:01.200\n at the level of consciousness.\n\n20:01.200 --> 20:03.600\n So if that's the case, then you just need to have\n\n20:03.600 --> 20:06.600\n an architecture that supports that information processing.\n\n20:06.600 --> 20:09.000\n So let's assume that that's true,\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:13.800\n that in fact what we call consciousness is really about\n\n20:13.800 --> 20:17.200\n a very peculiar kind of data stream.\n\n20:17.200 --> 20:21.400\n If that's the case, then if you can export that\n\n20:21.400 --> 20:25.500\n to a piece of hardware, something metal,\n\n20:25.500 --> 20:29.500\n electronic, what have you, then you certainly will,\n\n20:29.500 --> 20:32.400\n ultimately that kind of consciousness could get to Mars\n\n20:32.400 --> 20:35.000\n very quickly, it doesn't have our problems.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.800\n You can engineer the body, as I said,\n\n20:36.800 --> 20:39.200\n it's a ship or a body, you engineer one or both.\n\n20:41.300 --> 20:44.100\n Send it at a speed of light, well,\n\n20:44.100 --> 20:47.400\n that one is a more difficult one because that now\n\n20:47.400 --> 20:49.700\n goes beyond just a matter of having a data stream.\n\n20:49.700 --> 20:51.800\n It's now the preservation of the information\n\n20:51.800 --> 20:53.100\n in the data stream.\n\n20:53.100 --> 20:56.200\n And so unless you can build something that's like\n\n20:56.200 --> 20:59.800\n a super, super, super version of the way the internet works\n\n20:59.800 --> 21:02.100\n because most people aren't aware that the internet itself\n\n21:02.100 --> 21:04.700\n is actually a miracle, it's based on a technology\n\n21:04.700 --> 21:06.300\n called message packaging.\n\n21:06.300 --> 21:10.300\n So if you could exponentiate message packaging\n\n21:10.300 --> 21:11.900\n in some way to preserve the information\n\n21:11.900 --> 21:13.500\n that's in the data stream, then maybe\n\n21:13.500 --> 21:14.700\n your dream becomes true.\n\n21:16.200 --> 21:18.900\n You mentioned with artificial intelligence,\n\n21:18.900 --> 21:21.900\n sort of us human beings not having\n\n21:21.900 --> 21:24.400\n a monopoly on consciousness.\n\n21:24.400 --> 21:29.400\n Does the idea of artificial intelligence systems,\n\n21:29.400 --> 21:33.300\n computational systems, being able to basically\n\n21:33.300 --> 21:37.800\n replacing us humans scare you, excite you?\n\n21:37.800 --> 21:38.800\n What do you think about that?\n\n21:38.800 --> 21:40.100\n So I'm gonna tell you about a conversation\n\n21:40.100 --> 21:41.900\n I once had with Eric Schmidt.\n\n21:41.900 --> 21:43.300\n I was sitting at a meeting with him\n\n21:43.300 --> 21:46.700\n and he was a few feet away and he turned to me\n\n21:46.700 --> 21:49.300\n and he said something like, you know, Jim,\n\n21:49.300 --> 21:51.600\n in maybe a decade or so, we're gonna have computers\n\n21:51.600 --> 21:53.200\n that do what you do.\n\n21:53.200 --> 21:55.800\n And my response was not unless they can dream\n\n21:55.800 --> 21:57.700\n because there's something about,\n\n21:57.700 --> 22:01.200\n the way that we humans actually generate creativity.\n\n22:01.200 --> 22:04.700\n It's somehow, I get this sense of my lived experience\n\n22:04.700 --> 22:07.100\n in watching creative people that it's somehow\n\n22:07.100 --> 22:09.700\n connected to the irrational parts of what goes on\n\n22:09.700 --> 22:12.500\n in our head and dreaming is part of that irrational.\n\n22:12.500 --> 22:15.200\n So unless you can build a piece of artificial intelligence\n\n22:15.200 --> 22:17.200\n that dreams, I have a strong suspicion\n\n22:17.200 --> 22:21.100\n that you will not get something that will fully be conscious\n\n22:21.100 --> 22:24.300\n by a definition that I would accept, for example.\n\n22:24.300 --> 22:25.900\n So you mentioned dreaming.\n\n22:25.900 --> 22:30.900\n You've played around with some out there fascinating ideas.\n\n22:31.700 --> 22:35.300\n How do you think, and we'll start diving into\n\n22:35.300 --> 22:38.200\n the world of the very small ideas of super symmetry\n\n22:38.200 --> 22:41.700\n and all that in terms of visualization,\n\n22:41.700 --> 22:43.900\n in terms of how do you think about it?\n\n22:43.900 --> 22:44.900\n How do you dream of it?\n\n22:44.900 --> 22:46.700\n How do you come up with ideas\n\n22:46.700 --> 22:49.300\n in that fascinating, mysterious space?\n\n22:49.300 --> 22:52.900\n So in my workspace, which is basically\n\n22:52.900 --> 22:57.900\n where I am charged with coming up on a mathematical palette\n\n22:59.900 --> 23:02.100\n with new ideas that will help me understand\n\n23:02.100 --> 23:04.500\n the structure of nature and hopefully help all of us\n\n23:04.500 --> 23:06.300\n understand the structure of nature.\n\n23:06.300 --> 23:08.100\n I've observed several different ways\n\n23:08.100 --> 23:10.500\n in which my creativity expresses itself.\n\n23:10.500 --> 23:12.900\n There's one mode which looks pretty normal,\n\n23:12.900 --> 23:16.700\n which I sort of think of as the Chinese water torture method.\n\n23:16.700 --> 23:19.500\n Drop, drop, drop, you get more and more information\n\n23:19.500 --> 23:23.100\n and suddenly it all congeals and you get a clear picture.\n\n23:23.100 --> 23:25.100\n And so that's kind of a standard way of working.\n\n23:25.100 --> 23:27.700\n And I think that's how most people think about\n\n23:28.700 --> 23:30.700\n the way technical people solve problems.\n\n23:30.700 --> 23:34.700\n That is kind of you accumulate this body of information\n\n23:34.700 --> 23:37.300\n and at a certain point you synthesize it\n\n23:37.300 --> 23:39.100\n and then boom, there's something new.\n\n23:39.100 --> 23:41.900\n But I've also observed in myself and other scientists\n\n23:41.900 --> 23:44.500\n that there are other ways that we are creative.\n\n23:44.500 --> 23:48.900\n And these other ways to me are actually far more powerful.\n\n23:48.900 --> 23:50.500\n I first personally experienced this\n\n23:50.500 --> 23:53.500\n when I was a freshman at MIT over in Baker House\n\n23:53.500 --> 23:55.500\n right across the campus.\n\n23:55.500 --> 24:00.500\n And I was in a calculus course, 1801 is called at MIT.\n\n24:00.500 --> 24:03.700\n And calculus comes in two different flavors.\n\n24:03.700 --> 24:05.900\n One of them is called differential calculus.\n\n24:05.900 --> 24:07.500\n The other is called integral calculus.\n\n24:07.500 --> 24:09.700\n Differential calculus is the calculus\n\n24:09.700 --> 24:13.300\n that Newton invented to describe motion.\n\n24:13.300 --> 24:15.300\n It turns out integral calculus was probably invented\n\n24:15.300 --> 24:18.100\n about 1700 years earlier by Archimedes.\n\n24:18.100 --> 24:20.900\n But we didn't know that when I was a freshman.\n\n24:20.900 --> 24:24.100\n But so that's what you study as a student.\n\n24:24.100 --> 24:26.900\n And the differential calculus part of the course was,\n\n24:26.900 --> 24:30.300\n to me, I wouldn't, how do I say this?\n\n24:30.300 --> 24:32.900\n It was something that by the drip, drip, drip method\n\n24:32.900 --> 24:34.500\n you could sort of figure it out.\n\n24:35.300 --> 24:37.500\n Now, the integral part of calculus,\n\n24:37.500 --> 24:38.900\n I could memorize the formula.\n\n24:38.900 --> 24:42.100\n That was not the formulae, that was not the problem.\n\n24:42.100 --> 24:44.700\n The problem was why, in my own mind,\n\n24:44.700 --> 24:47.300\n why do these formulae work?\n\n24:47.300 --> 24:52.300\n And because of that, when I was in the part\n\n24:52.300 --> 24:53.900\n of the calculus course where we had to do\n\n24:53.900 --> 24:56.500\n multiple substitutions to solve integrals,\n\n24:56.500 --> 24:57.900\n I had a lot of difficulty.\n\n24:59.300 --> 25:01.300\n I was emotionally involved in my education\n\n25:01.300 --> 25:05.500\n because this is where I think the passion of motion comes to.\n\n25:05.500 --> 25:07.700\n And it caused an emotional crisis\n\n25:07.700 --> 25:09.100\n that I was having these difficulties\n\n25:09.100 --> 25:10.700\n understanding the integral part of calculus.\n\n25:10.700 --> 25:11.700\n The why.\n\n25:11.700 --> 25:12.900\n The why, that's right, the why of it.\n\n25:12.900 --> 25:15.100\n Not the rote memorization of fact,\n\n25:15.100 --> 25:16.300\n but the why of it.\n\n25:16.300 --> 25:18.300\n Why does this work?\n\n25:18.300 --> 25:21.700\n And so one night I was over in my dormitory room\n\n25:21.700 --> 25:23.100\n in Baker House.\n\n25:23.100 --> 25:25.900\n I was trying to do a calculus problem set.\n\n25:25.900 --> 25:27.500\n I was getting nowhere.\n\n25:28.500 --> 25:30.900\n I got a terrific headache.\n\n25:30.900 --> 25:33.700\n I went to sleep and had this very strange dream.\n\n25:33.700 --> 25:35.700\n And when I woke, awakened,\n\n25:36.700 --> 25:38.500\n I could do three and four substitutions\n\n25:38.500 --> 25:41.300\n and integrals with relative ease.\n\n25:41.300 --> 25:44.300\n Now, this to me was an astounding experience\n\n25:44.300 --> 25:48.700\n because I had never before in my life understood\n\n25:48.700 --> 25:51.100\n that one subconscious is actually capable\n\n25:51.100 --> 25:53.100\n of being harnessed to do mathematics.\n\n25:54.100 --> 25:55.100\n I experienced it, this.\n\n25:55.100 --> 25:56.700\n And I've experienced this more than once.\n\n25:56.700 --> 25:59.900\n So this was just the first time why I remember it so.\n\n25:59.900 --> 26:02.100\n So that's why when it comes to like\n\n26:02.100 --> 26:04.300\n really wickedly tough problems,\n\n26:04.300 --> 26:06.100\n I think that the kind of creativity\n\n26:06.100 --> 26:08.700\n that you need to solve them\n\n26:08.700 --> 26:10.900\n is probably this second variety\n\n26:10.900 --> 26:14.300\n which comes somehow from dreaming.\n\n26:15.900 --> 26:18.700\n Do you think, again, I told you I'm Russian.\n\n26:18.700 --> 26:20.500\n So we romanticize suffering.\n\n26:20.500 --> 26:22.300\n But do you think part of that equation\n\n26:22.300 --> 26:25.900\n is the suffering leading up to that dreaming?\n\n26:25.900 --> 26:28.500\n So the suffering is,\n\n26:28.500 --> 26:31.900\n I am convinced that this kind of creative,\n\n26:31.900 --> 26:34.700\n this second mode of creativity as I like to call it,\n\n26:34.700 --> 26:37.700\n I'm convinced that this second mode of creativity\n\n26:37.700 --> 26:42.700\n is in fact that suffering is a kind of crucible\n\n26:43.300 --> 26:44.700\n that triggers it.\n\n26:44.700 --> 26:47.700\n Because the mind I think is struggling to get out of this.\n\n26:47.700 --> 26:51.300\n And the only way to actually solve the problem.\n\n26:51.300 --> 26:54.100\n And even though you're not consciously solving problems,\n\n26:54.100 --> 26:55.500\n something is going on.\n\n26:55.500 --> 26:57.300\n And I've talked about to a few other people\n\n26:57.300 --> 27:00.100\n and I've heard other similar stories.\n\n27:00.100 --> 27:03.300\n And so I guess what I think about it is\n\n27:03.300 --> 27:04.900\n it's a little bit by like the way\n\n27:04.900 --> 27:07.900\n that thermonuclear weapons work.\n\n27:07.900 --> 27:09.300\n I don't know if you know how they work.\n\n27:09.300 --> 27:11.700\n But a thermonuclear weapon is actually two bombs.\n\n27:11.700 --> 27:14.300\n It's an atomic bomb which sort of does a compression.\n\n27:14.300 --> 27:16.100\n And then you have a fusion bomb that goes off.\n\n27:16.100 --> 27:18.900\n And somehow that emotional pressure\n\n27:18.900 --> 27:22.100\n I think acts like the first stage of a thermonuclear weapon.\n\n27:22.100 --> 27:24.100\n That's when we get really big thoughts.\n\n27:25.100 --> 27:27.500\n The analogy between thermonuclear weapons\n\n27:27.500 --> 27:30.900\n and the subconscious, the connection there is,\n\n27:30.900 --> 27:34.700\n at least visually, is kind of interesting.\n\n27:34.700 --> 27:39.700\n There may be, Freud would have a few things to say.\n\n27:39.700 --> 27:41.300\n Well, part of it is probably based\n\n27:41.300 --> 27:43.100\n on my own trajectory through life.\n\n27:43.100 --> 27:46.700\n My father was in the US Army for 27 years.\n\n27:46.700 --> 27:50.300\n And so I started my life out on a military basis.\n\n27:50.300 --> 27:53.700\n And so a lot of probably the things that wander around\n\n27:53.700 --> 27:56.300\n in my subconscious are connected to that experience.\n\n27:56.300 --> 27:58.700\n I apologize for all the tangents, but.\n\n27:58.700 --> 27:59.900\n Well, you're doing it.\n\n27:59.900 --> 28:01.100\n You're doing it.\n\n28:01.100 --> 28:07.100\n But you're encouraging by answering the stupid questions.\n\n28:07.100 --> 28:08.100\n No, they're not stupid.\n\n28:08.100 --> 28:12.100\n You know, your father was in the Army.\n\n28:14.100 --> 28:20.100\n What do you think about, Neil deGrasse Tyson recently wrote\n\n28:20.100 --> 28:25.500\n a book on interlinking the progress of science\n\n28:25.500 --> 28:31.700\n to sort of the aspirations of our military endeavors\n\n28:31.700 --> 28:33.900\n and DARPA funding and so on.\n\n28:33.900 --> 28:35.900\n What do you think about war in general?\n\n28:35.900 --> 28:37.900\n Do you think we'll always have war?\n\n28:37.900 --> 28:42.100\n Do you think we'll always have conflict in the world?\n\n28:42.100 --> 28:43.700\n I'm not sure that we're going to be able\n\n28:43.700 --> 28:47.500\n to afford to have war always, because if.\n\n28:47.500 --> 28:49.100\n Strictly financially speaking?\n\n28:49.100 --> 28:53.300\n No, not in terms of finance, but in terms of consequences.\n\n28:53.300 --> 28:56.900\n So if you look at technology today,\n\n28:56.900 --> 29:00.500\n you can have non state actors acquire technology,\n\n29:00.500 --> 29:05.100\n for example, bioterrorism, whose impact is roughly speaking\n\n29:05.100 --> 29:07.700\n equivalent to what it used to take nations\n\n29:07.700 --> 29:10.700\n to impart on a population.\n\n29:10.700 --> 29:13.300\n I think the cost of war is ultimately,\n\n29:13.300 --> 29:14.500\n it's going to be a little, I think\n\n29:14.500 --> 29:16.700\n it's going to work a little bit like the Cold War.\n\n29:16.700 --> 29:21.700\n You know, we survived 50, 60 years as a species\n\n29:21.700 --> 29:25.500\n with these weapons that are so terrible that they could have\n\n29:25.500 --> 29:29.000\n actually ended our form of life on this planet, but it didn't.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.100\n Why didn't it?\n\n29:30.100 --> 29:32.100\n Well, it's a very bizarre and interesting thing,\n\n29:32.100 --> 29:34.500\n but it was called mutually assured destruction.\n\n29:34.500 --> 29:37.500\n And so the cost was so great that people eventually\n\n29:37.500 --> 29:39.100\n figured out that you can't really\n\n29:39.100 --> 29:41.100\n use these things, which is kind of interesting,\n\n29:41.100 --> 29:43.300\n because if you read the history about the development\n\n29:43.300 --> 29:45.300\n of nuclear weapons, physicists actually\n\n29:45.300 --> 29:46.900\n realized this pretty quickly.\n\n29:46.900 --> 29:49.000\n I think it was maybe Schrodinger who\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.300\n said that these things are not really weapons.\n\n29:51.300 --> 29:52.900\n They're political implements.\n\n29:52.900 --> 29:55.900\n They're not weapons, because the cost is so high.\n\n29:55.900 --> 30:00.200\n And if you take that example and spread it out\n\n30:00.200 --> 30:01.900\n to the kind of technological development\n\n30:01.900 --> 30:04.200\n we're seeing now outside of nuclear physics,\n\n30:04.200 --> 30:06.900\n but I picked the example of biology,\n\n30:06.900 --> 30:10.500\n I could well imagine that there would be material science\n\n30:10.500 --> 30:14.500\n sorts of equivalents across a broad front of technology.\n\n30:14.500 --> 30:17.300\n You take that experience from nuclear weapons,\n\n30:17.300 --> 30:20.800\n and the picture that I see is that it would be possible\n\n30:20.800 --> 30:24.300\n to develop technologies that are so terrible that you couldn't\n\n30:24.300 --> 30:27.600\n use them, because the costs are too high.\n\n30:27.600 --> 30:29.100\n And that might cure us.\n\n30:29.100 --> 30:33.100\n And many people have argued that actually it prevented,\n\n30:33.100 --> 30:36.700\n nuclear weapons have prevented more military conflict than.\n\n30:36.700 --> 30:41.100\n It certainly froze the conflict domain.\n\n30:41.100 --> 30:44.000\n It's interesting that nowadays it\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.900\n was with the removal of the threat of mutually assured\n\n30:46.900 --> 30:52.300\n destruction that other forces took over in our geopolitics.\n\n30:52.300 --> 30:57.700\n Do you have worries of existential threats\n\n30:57.700 --> 31:00.200\n of nuclear weapons or other technologies\n\n31:00.200 --> 31:01.700\n like artificial intelligence?\n\n31:01.700 --> 31:05.100\n Do you think we humans will tend to figure out\n\n31:05.100 --> 31:06.900\n how to not blow ourselves up?\n\n31:06.900 --> 31:10.000\n I don't know, quite frankly.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:11.700\n This is something I've thought about.\n\n31:11.700 --> 31:16.900\n And I'm not, I mean, so I'm a spectator in the sense\n\n31:16.900 --> 31:21.700\n that as a scientist, I collect and collate data.\n\n31:21.700 --> 31:23.300\n So I've been doing that all my life\n\n31:23.300 --> 31:25.300\n and looking at my species.\n\n31:25.300 --> 31:27.500\n And it's not clear to me that we are\n\n31:27.500 --> 31:31.500\n going to avoid a catastrophic, self induced ending.\n\n31:34.500 --> 31:37.300\n Are you optimistic?\n\n31:37.300 --> 31:40.700\n Not as a scientist, but as a single element speaker?\n\n31:40.700 --> 31:45.400\n I would say I wouldn't bet against us.\n\n31:45.400 --> 31:47.100\n Beautifully put.\n\n31:47.100 --> 31:50.700\n Let's dive into the world of the very small,\n\n31:50.700 --> 31:52.900\n if we could for a bit.\n\n31:52.900 --> 31:56.900\n What are the basic particles, either experimentally observed\n\n31:56.900 --> 31:59.300\n or hypothesized by physicists?\n\n31:59.300 --> 32:02.500\n So as we physicists look at the universe,\n\n32:02.500 --> 32:05.300\n you can, first of all, there are two big buckets of particles.\n\n32:05.300 --> 32:07.200\n That is the smallest objects that we\n\n32:07.200 --> 32:11.300\n are able to currently mathematically conceive\n\n32:11.300 --> 32:15.700\n and then experimentally verify that these ideas have\n\n32:15.700 --> 32:17.700\n a sense of accuracy to them.\n\n32:17.700 --> 32:20.900\n So one of those buckets we call matter.\n\n32:20.900 --> 32:23.300\n These are things like electrons, things\n\n32:23.300 --> 32:25.900\n that are like quarks, which are particles that\n\n32:25.900 --> 32:27.900\n exist inside of protons.\n\n32:27.900 --> 32:30.700\n And there's a whole family of these things.\n\n32:30.700 --> 32:34.300\n There are, in fact, 18 quarks and apparently six\n\n32:34.300 --> 32:37.500\n electron like objects that we call leptons.\n\n32:37.500 --> 32:39.100\n So that's one bucket.\n\n32:39.100 --> 32:41.700\n The other bucket that we see both in our mathematics\n\n32:41.700 --> 32:43.700\n as well as in our experimental equipment\n\n32:43.700 --> 32:47.900\n are a set of particles that you can call force carriers.\n\n32:47.900 --> 32:50.700\n The most familiar force carrier is the photon, the particle\n\n32:50.700 --> 32:52.200\n of light that allows you to see me.\n\n32:52.200 --> 32:54.300\n In fact, it's the same object that\n\n32:54.300 --> 32:58.300\n carries electric repulsion between like charges.\n\n32:58.300 --> 33:00.900\n From science fiction, we have the object\n\n33:00.900 --> 33:03.600\n called the graviton, which is talked about a lot in science\n\n33:03.600 --> 33:05.300\n fiction and Star Trek.\n\n33:05.300 --> 33:07.500\n But the graviton is also a mathematical object\n\n33:07.500 --> 33:09.400\n that we physicists have known about essentially\n\n33:09.400 --> 33:13.400\n since Einstein wrote his theory of general relativity.\n\n33:13.400 --> 33:17.700\n There are four forces in nature, the fundamental forces.\n\n33:17.700 --> 33:19.600\n There is the gravitational force.\n\n33:19.600 --> 33:21.400\n Its carrier is the graviton.\n\n33:21.400 --> 33:23.100\n There are three other forces in nature,\n\n33:23.100 --> 33:25.800\n the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force,\n\n33:25.800 --> 33:27.000\n and the weak nuclear force.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:30.200\n And each one of these forces has one or more carriers.\n\n33:30.200 --> 33:33.200\n The photon is the carrier of the electromagnetic force.\n\n33:33.200 --> 33:35.900\n The strong nuclear force actually has eight carriers.\n\n33:35.900 --> 33:37.300\n They're called gluons.\n\n33:37.300 --> 33:39.500\n And then the weak nuclear force has three carriers.\n\n33:39.500 --> 33:44.000\n They're called the W plus, W minus, and Z bosons.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.500\n So those are the things that both in mathematics\n\n33:46.500 --> 33:49.900\n and in experiments, by the way, the most precise experiments\n\n33:49.900 --> 33:53.100\n we're ever as a species able to conduct\n\n33:53.100 --> 33:55.500\n is about measuring the accuracy of these ideas.\n\n33:55.500 --> 33:57.600\n And we know that at least to one part in a billion,\n\n33:57.600 --> 33:59.600\n these ideas are right.\n\n33:59.600 --> 34:05.400\n So first of all, you've made it sound both elegant and simple.\n\n34:05.400 --> 34:11.300\n But is it crazy to you that there is force carriers?\n\n34:11.300 --> 34:14.500\n Like, is that supposed to be a trivial idea to think about?\n\n34:14.500 --> 34:17.300\n If we think about photons, gluons,\n\n34:17.300 --> 34:21.300\n that there's four fundamental forces of physics,\n\n34:21.300 --> 34:24.200\n and then those forces are expressed.\n\n34:24.200 --> 34:26.600\n There's carriers of those forces.\n\n34:26.600 --> 34:29.600\n Like, is that a kind of trivial thing?\n\n34:29.600 --> 34:31.000\n It's not a trivial thing at all.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.100\n In fact, it was a puzzle for Sir Isaac Newton,\n\n34:33.100 --> 34:37.200\n because he's the first person to give us basically physics.\n\n34:37.200 --> 34:39.800\n Before Isaac Newton, physics didn't exist.\n\n34:39.800 --> 34:41.700\n What did exist was called natural philosophy,\n\n34:41.700 --> 34:45.100\n so discussions about using the methods of classical philosophy\n\n34:45.100 --> 34:48.400\n to understand nature, natural philosophy.\n\n34:48.400 --> 34:50.700\n So the Greeks, we call them scientists,\n\n34:50.700 --> 34:52.800\n but they were natural philosophers.\n\n34:52.800 --> 34:56.600\n Physics doesn't get born until Newton writes the Principia.\n\n34:56.600 --> 35:00.500\n One of the things that puzzled him was how gravity works,\n\n35:00.500 --> 35:04.800\n because if you read very carefully what he writes,\n\n35:04.800 --> 35:07.300\n he basically says, and I'm paraphrasing badly,\n\n35:07.300 --> 35:10.000\n but he basically says that someone who thinks deeply\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:13.200\n about this subject would find it inconceivable\n\n35:13.200 --> 35:17.000\n that an object in one place or location\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.500\n can magically reach out and affect another object\n\n35:19.500 --> 35:21.600\n with nothing intervening.\n\n35:21.600 --> 35:23.100\n And so it puzzled him.\n\n35:23.100 --> 35:25.700\n There's a puzzle of you, action at a distance.\n\n35:25.700 --> 35:27.000\n I mean, not as a physicist.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.900\n It would, it would, except that I am a physicist,\n\n35:29.900 --> 35:32.400\n and we have long ago resolved this issue,\n\n35:32.400 --> 35:33.500\n and the resolution came about\n\n35:33.500 --> 35:36.800\n through a second great physicist.\n\n35:36.800 --> 35:38.400\n Most people have heard of Newton.\n\n35:38.400 --> 35:40.100\n Most people have heard of Einstein.\n\n35:40.100 --> 35:41.100\n But between the two of them,\n\n35:41.100 --> 35:43.600\n there was another extraordinarily great physicist,\n\n35:43.600 --> 35:45.900\n a man named James Clark Maxwell.\n\n35:45.900 --> 35:49.500\n And Maxwell, between these two other giants,\n\n35:49.500 --> 35:52.900\n taught us about electric and magnetic forces,\n\n35:52.900 --> 35:55.900\n and it's from his equations that one can figure out\n\n35:55.900 --> 35:58.200\n that there's a carrier called the photon.\n\n35:58.200 --> 36:02.800\n So this was resolved for physicists around 1860 or so.\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:08.400\n So what are bosons and fermions and hadrons,\n\n36:08.400 --> 36:09.700\n elementary and composites?\n\n36:09.700 --> 36:12.900\n Sure, so earlier I said.\n\n36:12.900 --> 36:13.740\n Two buckets.\n\n36:13.740 --> 36:14.600\n You have got two buckets\n\n36:14.600 --> 36:15.800\n if you wanna try to build the universe.\n\n36:15.800 --> 36:18.700\n You gotta start off with things on these two buckets.\n\n36:18.700 --> 36:21.300\n So you gotta have things, that's a matter,\n\n36:21.300 --> 36:23.800\n and then you have to have other objects that act on them\n\n36:23.800 --> 36:28.400\n to cause those things to cohere to fixed finite patterns,\n\n36:28.400 --> 36:30.000\n because you need those fixed finite patterns\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.100\n as building blocks.\n\n36:31.100 --> 36:34.000\n So that's the way our universe looks to people like me.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:37.100\n Now, the building blocks do different things.\n\n36:37.100 --> 36:39.800\n So let's go back to these two buckets again.\n\n36:39.800 --> 36:42.800\n Let me start with a bucket containing the particle of light.\n\n36:42.800 --> 36:46.400\n Let me imagine I'm in a dusty room with two flashlights,\n\n36:46.400 --> 36:49.300\n and I have one flashlight, which I direct directly\n\n36:49.300 --> 36:52.800\n in front of me, and then I have you stand over to say my left\n\n36:52.800 --> 36:54.800\n and then we both take our flashlights and turn them on\n\n36:54.800 --> 36:56.800\n and make sure the beams go right through each other.\n\n36:56.800 --> 36:57.900\n And the beams do just that.\n\n36:57.900 --> 36:58.800\n They go right through each other.\n\n36:58.800 --> 37:00.300\n They don't bounce off of each other.\n\n37:00.300 --> 37:01.500\n The reason the room has to be dusty\n\n37:01.500 --> 37:03.500\n is because we wanna see the light.\n\n37:03.500 --> 37:04.500\n The room dust wasn't there.\n\n37:04.500 --> 37:05.500\n We wouldn't actually see the light\n\n37:05.500 --> 37:07.000\n until it got to the other wall, right?\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.900\n So you see the beam because it's the dust in the air.\n\n37:09.900 --> 37:12.600\n But the two beams actually pass right through each other.\n\n37:12.600 --> 37:13.900\n They literally pass right through.\n\n37:13.900 --> 37:15.900\n They don't affect each other at all.\n\n37:15.900 --> 37:17.800\n One acts like the other's not there.\n\n37:20.200 --> 37:23.000\n The particle of light is the simplest example\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:24.600\n that shows that behavior.\n\n37:24.600 --> 37:26.200\n That's a boson.\n\n37:26.200 --> 37:30.100\n Now let's imagine that we're in the same dusty room\n\n37:30.100 --> 37:31.900\n and this time you have a bucket of balls\n\n37:31.900 --> 37:33.100\n and I have a bucket of balls.\n\n37:33.100 --> 37:36.200\n And we try to throw them so that we get something\n\n37:36.200 --> 37:38.300\n like a beam, throwing them fast, right?\n\n37:39.200 --> 37:41.500\n If they collide, they don't just pass through each other.\n\n37:41.500 --> 37:43.400\n They bounce off of each other.\n\n37:43.400 --> 37:45.900\n Now that's mostly because they have electric charge\n\n37:45.900 --> 37:48.500\n and electric charges, light charges repel.\n\n37:48.500 --> 37:50.300\n But mathematically, I know how to turn off\n\n37:50.300 --> 37:51.500\n the electric charge.\n\n37:51.500 --> 37:53.800\n And if you do that, you'll find these still repel.\n\n37:53.800 --> 37:57.100\n And it's because they are these things we call fermions.\n\n37:57.100 --> 37:59.000\n So this is how you distinguish the things\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.200\n that are in the two buckets.\n\n38:00.200 --> 38:02.200\n They are either bosons or fermions.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.900\n Which of them, and maybe you can mention\n\n38:06.900 --> 38:09.900\n the most popular of the bosons.\n\n38:09.900 --> 38:12.000\n The most recently discovered.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:15.200\n It's like when I was in high school\n\n38:15.200 --> 38:18.300\n and there was a really popular majorette.\n\n38:18.300 --> 38:21.500\n Her name is the Higgs particle these days.\n\n38:21.500 --> 38:26.500\n Can you describe which of the bosons\n\n38:26.700 --> 38:28.500\n and the fermions have been discovered,\n\n38:28.500 --> 38:31.300\n hypothesized, which have been experimentally validated,\n\n38:31.300 --> 38:32.200\n what's still out there?\n\n38:32.200 --> 38:37.100\n Right, so the two buckets that I've actually described\n\n38:37.100 --> 38:40.200\n to you have all been first hypothesized\n\n38:40.200 --> 38:43.100\n and then verified by observation.\n\n38:43.100 --> 38:45.200\n With the Higgs boson being the most recent\n\n38:45.200 --> 38:47.200\n one of these things.\n\n38:47.200 --> 38:49.800\n We haven't actually verified the graviton\n\n38:49.800 --> 38:51.200\n interestingly enough.\n\n38:51.200 --> 38:54.100\n Mathematically, we have an expectation\n\n38:54.100 --> 38:55.400\n that gravitons exist.\n\n38:55.400 --> 38:56.900\n But we've not performed an experiment\n\n38:56.900 --> 38:59.900\n to show that this is an accurate idea that nature uses.\n\n38:59.900 --> 39:02.200\n So something has to be a carrier.\n\n39:02.200 --> 39:04.500\n For the force of gravity, exactly.\n\n39:04.500 --> 39:08.000\n Can it be something way more mysterious than we,\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:11.500\n so when you say the graviton, is it,\n\n39:11.500 --> 39:15.000\n would it be like the other particles, force carriers,\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:16.300\n or can it be something much more mysterious?\n\n39:16.300 --> 39:18.700\n In some ways, yes, but in other ways, no.\n\n39:18.700 --> 39:21.900\n It turns out that the graviton is also,\n\n39:21.900 --> 39:24.200\n if you look at Einstein's theory,\n\n39:24.200 --> 39:26.600\n he taught us about this thing he calls space time,\n\n39:26.600 --> 39:29.300\n which is, if you try to imagine it,\n\n39:29.300 --> 39:32.400\n you can sort of think of it as kind of a rubber surface.\n\n39:32.400 --> 39:34.900\n That's one popular depiction of space time.\n\n39:34.900 --> 39:36.200\n It's not an accurate depiction\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:38.600\n because the only accuracy is actually in the calculus\n\n39:38.600 --> 39:41.100\n that he uses, but that's close enough.\n\n39:41.100 --> 39:43.700\n So if you have a sheet of rubber, you can wave it.\n\n39:43.700 --> 39:46.000\n You can actually form a wave on it.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:47.800\n Space time is enough like that\n\n39:47.800 --> 39:51.000\n so that when space time oscillates, you create these waves.\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.100\n These waves carry energy.\n\n39:53.100 --> 39:55.000\n We expect them to carry energy in quanta.\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:56.100\n That's what a graviton is.\n\n39:56.100 --> 39:57.700\n It's a wave in space time.\n\n39:57.700 --> 40:00.700\n And so the fact that we have seen the waves\n\n40:00.700 --> 40:03.700\n with LIGO over the course of the last three years,\n\n40:03.700 --> 40:07.200\n and we've recently used gravitational wave observatories\n\n40:07.200 --> 40:09.800\n to watch colliding black holes and neutron stars\n\n40:09.800 --> 40:12.500\n and all sorts of really cool stuff out there.\n\n40:12.500 --> 40:14.600\n So we know the waves exist,\n\n40:14.600 --> 40:16.700\n but in order to know that gravitons exist,\n\n40:16.700 --> 40:18.800\n you have to prove that these waves carry energy\n\n40:18.800 --> 40:20.400\n in energy packets.\n\n40:20.400 --> 40:23.400\n And that's what we don't have the technology to do yet.\n\n40:25.100 --> 40:28.300\n And perhaps briefly jumping to a philosophical question,\n\n40:28.300 --> 40:30.600\n does it make sense to you that gravity\n\n40:30.600 --> 40:32.900\n is so much weaker than the other forces?\n\n40:32.900 --> 40:34.300\n No.\n\n40:34.300 --> 40:39.300\n You see, now you've touched on a very deep mystery\n\n40:40.500 --> 40:41.700\n about physics.\n\n40:42.600 --> 40:44.300\n There are a lot of such questions in physics\n\n40:44.300 --> 40:47.200\n about why things are as they are.\n\n40:47.200 --> 40:50.900\n And as someone who believes that there are some things\n\n40:50.900 --> 40:53.400\n that certainly are coincidences,\n\n40:53.400 --> 40:54.800\n like you could ask the same question about,\n\n40:54.800 --> 40:57.100\n well, why are the planets at the orbits\n\n40:57.100 --> 40:58.900\n that they are around the sun?\n\n40:58.900 --> 41:00.300\n The answer turns out there is no good reason.\n\n41:00.300 --> 41:01.400\n It's just an accident.\n\n41:01.400 --> 41:03.500\n So there are things in nature that have that character.\n\n41:03.500 --> 41:08.500\n And perhaps the strength of the various forces is like that.\n\n41:08.600 --> 41:10.900\n On the other hand, we don't know that that's the case.\n\n41:10.900 --> 41:12.500\n And there may be some deep reasons\n\n41:12.500 --> 41:15.900\n about why the forces are ordered as they are,\n\n41:15.900 --> 41:17.600\n where the weakest force is gravity,\n\n41:17.600 --> 41:19.700\n the next weakest force is the weak interaction,\n\n41:19.700 --> 41:22.000\n the weak nuclear force, then there's electromagnetism,\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:23.100\n there's a strong force.\n\n41:23.100 --> 41:24.700\n We don't really have a good understanding\n\n41:24.700 --> 41:27.000\n of why this is the ordering of the forces.\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:30.900\n So some of the fascinating work you've done\n\n41:30.900 --> 41:35.900\n is in the space of supersymmetry, symmetry in general.\n\n41:36.300 --> 41:39.500\n Can you describe, first of all, what is supersymmetry?\n\n41:39.500 --> 41:41.400\n Yes, so you remember the two buckets\n\n41:41.400 --> 41:43.500\n I told you about perhaps earlier?\n\n41:43.500 --> 41:46.100\n So there are two buckets in our universe.\n\n41:46.100 --> 41:51.100\n So now I want you to think about drawing a pie\n\n41:51.800 --> 41:53.000\n that has four quadrants.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:56.200\n So I want you to cut the piece of pie in fourths.\n\n41:56.200 --> 41:58.300\n So in one quadrant, I'm gonna put all the buckets\n\n41:58.300 --> 42:01.400\n that we talked about that are like the electron and quarks.\n\n42:01.400 --> 42:02.400\n In a different quadrant,\n\n42:02.400 --> 42:04.500\n I'm going to put all the force carriers.\n\n42:04.500 --> 42:06.600\n The other two quadrants are empty.\n\n42:06.600 --> 42:08.500\n Now, I showed you a picture of that.\n\n42:08.500 --> 42:10.100\n You'd see a circle.\n\n42:10.100 --> 42:12.600\n There would be a bunch of stuff in one upper quadrant\n\n42:12.600 --> 42:13.900\n and stuff in others.\n\n42:13.900 --> 42:15.900\n And then I would ask you a question.\n\n42:15.900 --> 42:17.600\n Does that look symmetrical to you?\n\n42:19.100 --> 42:20.700\n No. No.\n\n42:20.700 --> 42:22.100\n And that's exactly right\n\n42:22.100 --> 42:26.700\n because we humans actually have a very deeply programmed\n\n42:26.700 --> 42:28.000\n sense of symmetry.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:32.900\n It's something that is part of that mystery of the universe.\n\n42:32.900 --> 42:34.300\n So how would you make it symmetrical?\n\n42:34.300 --> 42:35.800\n Or one way you could is by saying\n\n42:35.800 --> 42:38.900\n those two empty quadrants had things in them also.\n\n42:38.900 --> 42:42.500\n And if you do that, that's supersymmetry.\n\n42:42.500 --> 42:43.500\n So that's what I understood\n\n42:43.500 --> 42:47.900\n when I was a graduate student here at MIT in 1975\n\n42:47.900 --> 42:52.300\n when the mathematics of this was first being born.\n\n42:52.300 --> 42:55.000\n Supersymmetry was actually born in the Ukraine\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:56.700\n in the late 60s, but we had this thing\n\n42:56.700 --> 42:57.600\n called the Iron Curtain.\n\n42:57.600 --> 43:00.500\n So we Westerners didn't know about it.\n\n43:00.500 --> 43:02.900\n But by the early 70s, independently,\n\n43:02.900 --> 43:04.300\n there were scientists in the West\n\n43:04.300 --> 43:07.500\n who had rediscovered supersymmetry.\n\n43:07.500 --> 43:10.400\n Bruno Zemeno and Julius Wess were their names.\n\n43:10.400 --> 43:14.100\n So this was around 71 or 72 when this happened.\n\n43:14.100 --> 43:16.200\n I started graduate school in 73.\n\n43:16.200 --> 43:19.200\n So around 74, 75, I was trying to figure out\n\n43:19.200 --> 43:21.500\n how to write a thesis so that I could become a physicist\n\n43:21.500 --> 43:22.600\n the rest of my life.\n\n43:23.600 --> 43:27.700\n I did a, I had a great advisor, Professor James Young\n\n43:27.700 --> 43:31.100\n who had taught me a number of things about electrons\n\n43:31.100 --> 43:33.900\n and weak forces and those sorts of things.\n\n43:33.900 --> 43:38.900\n But I decided that if I was going to have a really\n\n43:40.900 --> 43:45.500\n an opportunity to maximize my chances of being successful,\n\n43:45.500 --> 43:46.900\n I should strike it out in a direction\n\n43:46.900 --> 43:48.800\n that other people were not studying.\n\n43:48.800 --> 43:52.200\n And so as a consequence, I surveyed ideas\n\n43:52.200 --> 43:54.300\n that were going, that were being developed.\n\n43:54.300 --> 43:57.100\n And I came across the idea of supersymmetry.\n\n43:57.100 --> 44:00.700\n And it was so, the mathematics was so remarkable\n\n44:00.700 --> 44:03.100\n that I just, it bowled me over.\n\n44:03.100 --> 44:05.500\n I actually have two undergraduate degrees.\n\n44:05.500 --> 44:07.600\n My first undergraduate degree is actually mathematics.\n\n44:07.600 --> 44:09.400\n And my second is physics,\n\n44:09.400 --> 44:12.000\n even though I always wanted to be a physicist.\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:17.000\n Plan A, which involved getting good grades was mathematics.\n\n44:17.500 --> 44:20.500\n I was a mathematics major thinking about graduate school,\n\n44:20.500 --> 44:22.000\n but my heart was in physics.\n\n44:22.800 --> 44:26.200\n If we could take a small digression,\n\n44:26.200 --> 44:29.100\n what's to you the most beautiful idea in mathematics\n\n44:29.100 --> 44:31.600\n that you've encountered in this interplay\n\n44:31.600 --> 44:33.400\n between math and physics?\n\n44:33.400 --> 44:35.500\n It's the idea of symmetry.\n\n44:35.500 --> 44:39.900\n The fact that our innate sense of symmetry\n\n44:39.900 --> 44:44.500\n winds up aligning with just incredible mathematics,\n\n44:44.500 --> 44:47.400\n to me is the most beautiful thing.\n\n44:47.400 --> 44:50.100\n It's very strange, but true\n\n44:50.100 --> 44:53.100\n that if symmetries were perfect, we would not exist.\n\n44:53.100 --> 44:55.200\n And so even though we have these very powerful ideas\n\n44:55.200 --> 44:57.700\n about balance in the universe in some sense,\n\n44:57.700 --> 44:59.200\n it's only when you break those balances\n\n44:59.200 --> 45:01.000\n that you get creatures like humans\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.600\n and objects like planets and stars.\n\n45:03.600 --> 45:07.100\n So although they are a scaffold for reality,\n\n45:07.100 --> 45:09.500\n they cannot be the entirety of reality.\n\n45:09.500 --> 45:14.500\n So I'm kind of naturally attracted\n\n45:15.500 --> 45:18.900\n to parts of science and technology\n\n45:18.900 --> 45:21.400\n where symmetry plays a dominant role.\n\n45:21.400 --> 45:23.500\n And not just, I guess, symmetry as you said,\n\n45:23.500 --> 45:26.800\n but the magic happens when you break the symmetry.\n\n45:26.800 --> 45:29.600\n The magic happens when you break the symmetry.\n\n45:29.600 --> 45:31.300\n Okay, so diving right back in,\n\n45:31.300 --> 45:33.100\n you mentioned four quadrants.\n\n45:33.100 --> 45:34.100\n Yes.\n\n45:34.100 --> 45:37.100\n Two are filled with stuff we can, two buckets.\n\n45:37.100 --> 45:39.500\n And then there's crazy mathematical thing,\n\n45:39.500 --> 45:41.600\n ideas fulfilling the other two.\n\n45:41.600 --> 45:43.300\n What are those things?\n\n45:43.300 --> 45:46.200\n So earlier, the way I described these two buckets\n\n45:46.200 --> 45:48.900\n is I gave you a story that started out\n\n45:48.900 --> 45:52.700\n by putting us in a dusty room with two flashlights.\n\n45:52.700 --> 45:55.300\n And I said, turn on your flashlight, I'll turn on mine,\n\n45:55.300 --> 45:56.700\n the beams will go through each other.\n\n45:56.700 --> 46:00.900\n And the beams are composed of force carriers called photons.\n\n46:00.900 --> 46:03.200\n They carry the electromagnetic force\n\n46:03.200 --> 46:04.300\n and they pass right through each other.\n\n46:04.300 --> 46:07.600\n So imagine looking at the mathematics of such an object,\n\n46:07.600 --> 46:10.400\n which you don't have to imagine people like me do that.\n\n46:11.400 --> 46:12.800\n So you take that mathematics\n\n46:12.800 --> 46:15.200\n and then you ask yourself a question.\n\n46:15.200 --> 46:16.700\n You see, mathematics is a palette.\n\n46:16.700 --> 46:20.700\n It's just like a musical composer\n\n46:20.700 --> 46:24.400\n is able to construct variations on a theme.\n\n46:24.400 --> 46:26.800\n Well, a piece of mathematics in the hand of a physicist\n\n46:26.800 --> 46:29.000\n is something that we can construct variations on.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:33.300\n So even though the mathematics that Maxwell gave us\n\n46:33.300 --> 46:38.200\n about light, we know how to construct variations on that.\n\n46:38.200 --> 46:41.100\n And one of the variations you can construct is to say,\n\n46:41.100 --> 46:45.400\n suppose you have a force carrier for electromagnetism\n\n46:45.400 --> 46:47.200\n that behaves like an electron\n\n46:47.200 --> 46:49.500\n in that it would bounce off of another one.\n\n46:49.500 --> 46:53.200\n That's changing a mathematical term in an equation.\n\n46:53.200 --> 46:56.600\n So if you did that, you would have a force carrier.\n\n46:56.600 --> 46:58.200\n So you would say first it belongs\n\n46:58.200 --> 46:59.600\n in this force carrying bucket,\n\n46:59.600 --> 47:01.700\n but it's got this property of bouncing off like electrons.\n\n47:01.700 --> 47:03.400\n So you say, well, gee, wait, no,\n\n47:03.400 --> 47:04.600\n that's not the right bucket.\n\n47:04.600 --> 47:05.800\n So you're forced to actually put it\n\n47:05.800 --> 47:07.800\n in one of these empty quadrants.\n\n47:07.800 --> 47:12.100\n So those sorts of things, basically we give them...\n\n47:12.100 --> 47:14.400\n So the photon mathematically\n\n47:14.400 --> 47:15.900\n can be accompanied by a photino.\n\n47:15.900 --> 47:18.200\n It's the thing that carries a force\n\n47:18.200 --> 47:19.800\n but has the rule of bouncing off.\n\n47:20.700 --> 47:23.300\n In a similar manner, you could start with an electron\n\n47:24.200 --> 47:27.000\n and you say, okay, so write down the mathematical electron.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:28.200\n I know how to do that.\n\n47:28.200 --> 47:30.200\n A physicist named Dirac first told us how to do that\n\n47:30.200 --> 47:33.500\n back in the late 20s, early 30s.\n\n47:33.500 --> 47:34.600\n So take that mathematics.\n\n47:34.600 --> 47:37.700\n And then you say, let me look at that mathematics\n\n47:37.700 --> 47:39.600\n and find out what in the mathematics\n\n47:39.600 --> 47:42.300\n causes two electrons to bounce off of each other,\n\n47:42.300 --> 47:44.500\n even if I turn off the electrical charge.\n\n47:44.500 --> 47:45.600\n So I could do that.\n\n47:45.600 --> 47:48.200\n And now let me change that mathematical term.\n\n47:48.200 --> 47:50.700\n So now I have something that carries electrical charge,\n\n47:50.700 --> 47:52.300\n but if you take two of them,\n\n47:52.300 --> 47:53.700\n I'm sorry, if you turn their charges off,\n\n47:53.700 --> 47:55.300\n they'll pass through each other.\n\n47:55.300 --> 47:57.600\n So that puts things in the other quadrant.\n\n47:57.600 --> 48:00.600\n And those things we tend to call,\n\n48:00.600 --> 48:02.500\n we put the S in front of their name.\n\n48:02.500 --> 48:04.800\n So in the lower quadrant here, we have electrons\n\n48:04.800 --> 48:08.100\n and this now newly filled quadrant, we have selectors.\n\n48:08.100 --> 48:12.300\n And the quadrant over here, we had quarks.\n\n48:12.300 --> 48:13.700\n Over here, we have squarks.\n\n48:13.700 --> 48:15.600\n So now we've got this balanced pie.\n\n48:15.600 --> 48:17.600\n And that's basically what I understood\n\n48:17.600 --> 48:20.500\n as a graduate student in 1975\n\n48:20.500 --> 48:22.400\n about this idea of supersymmetry,\n\n48:22.400 --> 48:24.300\n that it was going to fill up these two quadrants\n\n48:24.300 --> 48:25.900\n of the pie in a way that no one\n\n48:25.900 --> 48:27.700\n had ever thought about before.\n\n48:27.700 --> 48:30.200\n So I was amazed that no one else at MIT\n\n48:30.200 --> 48:32.300\n found this an interesting idea.\n\n48:32.300 --> 48:37.300\n So it led to my becoming the first person in MIT\n\n48:37.300 --> 48:39.500\n to really study supersymmetry.\n\n48:39.500 --> 48:42.600\n This is 1975, 76, 77.\n\n48:42.600 --> 48:44.900\n And in 77, I wrote the first PhD thesis\n\n48:44.900 --> 48:47.100\n in the physics department on this idea\n\n48:47.100 --> 48:49.600\n because I was drawn to the balance.\n\n48:50.500 --> 48:51.700\n Drawn to the symmetry.\n\n48:51.700 --> 48:56.800\n So what does that, first of all,\n\n48:56.800 --> 49:01.200\n is this fundamentally a mathematical idea?\n\n49:01.200 --> 49:04.400\n So how much experimental, and we'll have this theme.\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:05.600\n It's a really interesting one.\n\n49:05.600 --> 49:08.200\n When you explore the world of the small\n\n49:08.200 --> 49:11.200\n and in your new book talking about\n\n49:11.200 --> 49:14.100\n Approving Einstein, right, that we'll also talk about,\n\n49:14.100 --> 49:16.700\n there's this theme of kind of starting it,\n\n49:16.700 --> 49:19.600\n exploring crazy ideas first in the mathematics\n\n49:19.600 --> 49:23.000\n and then seeking for ways to experimentally validate them.\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.600\n Where do you put supersymmetry in that?\n\n49:25.600 --> 49:28.200\n It's closer than string theory.\n\n49:28.200 --> 49:30.700\n It has not yet been validated.\n\n49:30.700 --> 49:33.200\n In some sense, you mentioned Einstein,\n\n49:33.200 --> 49:35.400\n so let's go there for a moment.\n\n49:35.400 --> 49:37.000\n In our book, Approving Einstein Right,\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:38.800\n we actually do talk about the fact\n\n49:38.800 --> 49:42.900\n that Albert Einstein in 1915 wrote a set of equations\n\n49:42.900 --> 49:45.100\n which were very different from Newton's equations\n\n49:45.100 --> 49:46.800\n in describing gravity.\n\n49:46.800 --> 49:48.900\n These equations made some predictions\n\n49:48.900 --> 49:51.200\n that were different from Newton's predictions.\n\n49:51.200 --> 49:53.100\n It actually made three different predictions.\n\n49:53.100 --> 49:55.000\n One of them was not actually a prediction,\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\n but a postdiction, because it was known\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.500\n that Mercury was not orbiting the sun\n\n49:59.500 --> 50:01.600\n in the way that Newton would have told you.\n\n50:01.600 --> 50:05.400\n And so Einstein's theory actually describes Mercury\n\n50:05.400 --> 50:08.200\n orbiting in a way that was observed\n\n50:08.200 --> 50:09.800\n as opposed to what Newton would have told you.\n\n50:09.800 --> 50:11.600\n So that was one prediction.\n\n50:11.600 --> 50:13.400\n The second prediction that came out of\n\n50:13.400 --> 50:14.700\n the theory of general relativity,\n\n50:14.700 --> 50:17.400\n which Einstein wrote in 1915,\n\n50:17.400 --> 50:19.000\n was that if you,\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.400\n so let me describe an experiment and come back to it.\n\n50:23.400 --> 50:25.400\n Suppose I had a glass of water,\n\n50:25.400 --> 50:28.800\n and I filled the glass up,\n\n50:28.800 --> 50:31.000\n and then I moved the glass slowly back and forth\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:32.800\n between our two faces.\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:36.600\n It would appear to me like your face was moving,\n\n50:36.600 --> 50:38.000\n even though you weren't moving.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\n I mean, it's actually, and what's causing it\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.200\n is because the light gets bent through the glass\n\n50:42.200 --> 50:45.000\n as it passes from your face to my eye.\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:50.000\n So Einstein in his 1915 theory of general relativity\n\n50:50.800 --> 50:54.400\n found out that gravity has the same effect on light\n\n50:54.400 --> 50:55.400\n as that glass of water.\n\n50:55.400 --> 50:58.200\n It would cause beams of light to bend.\n\n50:58.200 --> 51:01.000\n Now, Newton also knew this,\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:02.600\n but Einstein's prediction was that light\n\n51:02.600 --> 51:04.800\n would bend twice as much.\n\n51:04.800 --> 51:07.200\n And so here's a mathematical idea.\n\n51:07.200 --> 51:09.000\n Now, how do you actually prove it?\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.400\n Well, you've got to watch.\n\n51:11.400 --> 51:15.800\n Just a quick pause on that, just the language you're using.\n\n51:15.800 --> 51:17.800\n He found out.\n\n51:17.800 --> 51:19.600\n I can say he did a calculation.\n\n51:19.600 --> 51:21.200\n It's a really interesting notion\n\n51:21.200 --> 51:25.200\n that one of the beautiful things about this universe\n\n51:25.200 --> 51:28.000\n is you can do a calculation\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.900\n and combine with some of that magical intuition\n\n51:30.900 --> 51:35.200\n that physicists have, actually predict what would be,\n\n51:35.200 --> 51:37.600\n what's possible to experimentally validate.\n\n51:37.600 --> 51:38.440\n That's correct.\n\n51:38.440 --> 51:40.000\n So he found out in the sense\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:43.300\n that there seems to be something here\n\n51:43.300 --> 51:46.000\n and mathematically it should bend,\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.500\n gravity should bend light this amount.\n\n51:48.500 --> 51:51.400\n And so therefore that's something that could be potentially,\n\n51:51.400 --> 51:53.300\n and then come up with an experiment that could be validated.\n\n51:53.300 --> 51:54.400\n Right.\n\n51:54.400 --> 51:57.300\n And that's the way that actually modern physics,\n\n51:57.300 --> 52:00.900\n deeply fundamental modern physics, this is how it works.\n\n52:02.400 --> 52:04.400\n Earlier we spoke about the Higgs boson.\n\n52:04.400 --> 52:06.000\n So why did we go looking for it?\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:10.900\n The answer is that back in the late 60s and early 70s,\n\n52:10.900 --> 52:12.700\n some people wrote some equations\n\n52:12.700 --> 52:15.500\n and the equations predicted this.\n\n52:15.500 --> 52:17.100\n So then we went looking for it.\n\n52:18.500 --> 52:21.300\n So on supersymmetry for a second,\n\n52:21.300 --> 52:25.100\n there's these things called idynchrous symbols,\n\n52:25.100 --> 52:26.700\n these strange little graphs.\n\n52:26.700 --> 52:27.700\n Yes.\n\n52:27.700 --> 52:29.500\n You refer to them as revealing something\n\n52:29.500 --> 52:32.700\n like binary code underlying reality.\n\n52:32.700 --> 52:34.900\n First of all, can you describe these graphs?\n\n52:34.900 --> 52:36.700\n Describe these graphs, what are they?\n\n52:38.100 --> 52:40.700\n What are these beautiful little strange graphs?\n\n52:40.700 --> 52:44.800\n Well, first of all, idynchrous are an invention of mine,\n\n52:44.800 --> 52:46.900\n together with a colleague named Michael Fox.\n\n52:46.900 --> 52:50.000\n In 2005, we were looking at equations.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:51.800\n Well, the story's a little bit more complicated\n\n52:51.800 --> 52:54.000\n and it'll take too long to explain all the details,\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:55.600\n but the Reader's Digest version\n\n52:55.600 --> 52:58.000\n is that we were looking at these equations\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:01.100\n and we figured out that all the data\n\n53:01.100 --> 53:04.600\n in a certain class of equations could be put in pictures.\n\n53:04.600 --> 53:06.400\n And the pictures, what do they look like?\n\n53:06.400 --> 53:09.400\n Well, they're just little balls.\n\n53:09.400 --> 53:12.100\n You have black balls and white balls.\n\n53:12.100 --> 53:14.100\n Those stand for those two buckets, by the way,\n\n53:14.100 --> 53:15.700\n that we talked about in reality.\n\n53:15.700 --> 53:18.600\n The white balls are things that are like particles of light.\n\n53:18.600 --> 53:20.800\n The black balls are like electrons.\n\n53:20.800 --> 53:24.400\n And then you can draw lines connecting these balls.\n\n53:24.400 --> 53:27.400\n And these lines are deeply mathematical objects\n\n53:27.400 --> 53:29.100\n and there's no way for me to,\n\n53:29.100 --> 53:33.900\n I have no physical model for telling you what the lines are.\n\n53:33.900 --> 53:36.200\n But if you were a mathematician,\n\n53:36.200 --> 53:37.900\n I would do a technical phrase saying,\n\n53:37.900 --> 53:39.600\n this is the orbit of the representation\n\n53:39.600 --> 53:41.900\n and the action of the symmetry generators.\n\n53:41.900 --> 53:43.600\n Mathematicians wouldn't understand that.\n\n53:43.600 --> 53:45.100\n Nobody else in their right mind would,\n\n53:45.100 --> 53:47.000\n so let's not go there.\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.700\n So, but we figured out that the data\n\n53:49.700 --> 53:52.000\n that was in the equations was in these funny pictures\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:53.800\n that we could draw.\n\n53:53.800 --> 53:55.500\n And so that was stunning,\n\n53:56.900 --> 53:59.700\n but it also was encouraging\n\n53:59.700 --> 54:02.400\n because there are problems with the equations,\n\n54:02.400 --> 54:06.700\n which I had first learned about in 1979\n\n54:06.700 --> 54:07.900\n when I was down at Harvard\n\n54:07.900 --> 54:09.900\n and I went out to Caltech for the first time\n\n54:09.900 --> 54:11.700\n and working with a great scientist\n\n54:11.700 --> 54:12.700\n by the name of John Schwartz.\n\n54:12.700 --> 54:16.000\n There are problems in the equations we don't know how to solve.\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.300\n And so one of the things about solving problems\n\n54:18.300 --> 54:20.100\n that you don't know how to solve\n\n54:20.100 --> 54:22.800\n is that beating your head against a brick wall\n\n54:22.800 --> 54:25.900\n is probably not a good philosophy about how to solve it.\n\n54:25.900 --> 54:26.800\n So what do you need to do?\n\n54:26.800 --> 54:29.300\n You need to change your sense of reference,\n\n54:29.300 --> 54:31.300\n your frame of reference, your perspective.\n\n54:31.300 --> 54:35.100\n So when I saw these funny pictures,\n\n54:35.100 --> 54:37.500\n I thought, gee, that might be a way\n\n54:37.500 --> 54:39.000\n to solve these problems with equations\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.800\n that we don't know how to do.\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:44.400\n So that was for me one of the first attractions\n\n54:44.400 --> 54:46.900\n is that I now had an alternative language\n\n54:46.900 --> 54:49.800\n to try to attack a set of mathematical problems.\n\n54:50.700 --> 54:54.600\n But I quickly realized that A,\n\n54:54.600 --> 54:58.100\n this mathematical language was not known by mathematicians,\n\n54:58.100 --> 54:59.900\n which makes it pretty interesting\n\n54:59.900 --> 55:02.700\n because now you have to actually teach mathematicians\n\n55:02.700 --> 55:04.100\n about a piece of mathematics\n\n55:04.100 --> 55:05.900\n because that's how they make their living.\n\n55:05.900 --> 55:08.000\n And the great thing about working with mathematicians,\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:11.100\n of course, is the rigor with which they examine ideas.\n\n55:11.100 --> 55:14.400\n So they make your ideas better than they start out.\n\n55:14.400 --> 55:16.600\n So I start working with a group of mathematicians\n\n55:16.600 --> 55:18.500\n and it was in that collaboration that we figured out\n\n55:18.500 --> 55:20.740\n that these funny pictures had error correcting codes\n\n55:20.740 --> 55:21.580\n buried in them.\n\n55:23.500 --> 55:25.700\n Can you talk about what are error correcting codes?\n\n55:25.700 --> 55:26.700\n Ah, sure.\n\n55:26.700 --> 55:30.900\n So the simplest way to talk about error correcting codes\n\n55:32.100 --> 55:36.800\n is first of all, to talk about digital information.\n\n55:36.800 --> 55:39.600\n Digital information is basically strings of ones and zeros.\n\n55:39.600 --> 55:41.100\n They're called bits.\n\n55:41.100 --> 55:45.700\n So now let's imagine that I want to send you some bits.\n\n55:46.700 --> 55:50.300\n Well, maybe I could show you pictures,\n\n55:50.300 --> 55:52.200\n but maybe it's a rainy day\n\n55:52.200 --> 55:56.300\n or maybe the windows in your house are foggy.\n\n55:56.300 --> 55:59.300\n So sometimes when I show you a zero,\n\n55:59.300 --> 56:01.600\n you might interpret it as a one.\n\n56:01.600 --> 56:03.300\n Or other times when I show you a one,\n\n56:03.300 --> 56:05.800\n you might interpret it as a zero.\n\n56:05.800 --> 56:07.100\n So if that's the case,\n\n56:07.100 --> 56:08.800\n that means when I try to send you this data,\n\n56:08.800 --> 56:11.000\n it comes to you in corrupted form.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:14.300\n And so the challenge is how do you get it to be uncorrupted?\n\n56:15.500 --> 56:20.500\n In the 1940s, a computer scientist named Hamming\n\n56:21.700 --> 56:24.700\n addressed the problem of how do you reliably transmit\n\n56:24.700 --> 56:26.200\n digital information?\n\n56:26.200 --> 56:29.400\n And what he came up with was a brilliant idea.\n\n56:29.400 --> 56:31.300\n Now, the way that you solve it\n\n56:31.300 --> 56:33.200\n is that you take the data that you want to send,\n\n56:33.200 --> 56:34.900\n the ones in your strings of ones and zeros,\n\n56:34.900 --> 56:36.100\n your favorite string,\n\n56:36.100 --> 56:38.000\n and then you dump more ones and zeros in,\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:41.200\n but you dump them in in a particular pattern.\n\n56:41.200 --> 56:42.900\n And this particular pattern\n\n56:42.900 --> 56:45.300\n is what a Hamming code is all about.\n\n56:45.300 --> 56:46.600\n So it's an error correcting code\n\n56:46.600 --> 56:48.400\n because if the person at the other end\n\n56:48.400 --> 56:49.800\n knows what the pattern's supposed to be,\n\n56:49.800 --> 56:52.200\n they can figure out when one's got changed to zeros,\n\n56:52.200 --> 56:53.700\n zero's got changed to one.\n\n56:53.700 --> 56:57.500\n So it turned out that our strange little objects\n\n56:57.500 --> 56:59.300\n that came from looking at the equations\n\n56:59.300 --> 57:00.800\n that we couldn't solve,\n\n57:00.800 --> 57:02.700\n it turns out that when you look at them deeply enough,\n\n57:02.700 --> 57:06.200\n you find out that they have ones and zeros\n\n57:06.200 --> 57:07.500\n buried in them.\n\n57:07.500 --> 57:08.800\n But even more astoundingly,\n\n57:08.800 --> 57:10.800\n the ones and zeros are not there randomly.\n\n57:10.800 --> 57:14.200\n They are in the pattern of error correcting codes.\n\n57:14.200 --> 57:16.000\n So this was an astounding thing\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:19.000\n that when we first got this result\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:20.000\n and tried to publish it,\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:22.000\n it took us three years to convince other physicists\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:23.800\n that we weren't crazy.\n\n57:23.800 --> 57:25.200\n Eventually we were able to publish it,\n\n57:25.200 --> 57:27.400\n I and this collaboration of mathematicians\n\n57:27.400 --> 57:29.300\n and other physicists.\n\n57:29.300 --> 57:31.400\n And so ever since then,\n\n57:31.400 --> 57:34.400\n I have actually been looking at the mathematics\n\n57:34.400 --> 57:35.900\n of these objects,\n\n57:35.900 --> 57:39.200\n trying to still understand properties of the equations.\n\n57:39.200 --> 57:40.800\n And I want to understand the properties of equations\n\n57:40.800 --> 57:43.300\n because I want to be able to try things like electrons.\n\n57:43.300 --> 57:44.300\n So as you can see,\n\n57:44.300 --> 57:46.200\n it's just like a two step removed process\n\n57:46.200 --> 57:48.400\n of trying to get back to reality.\n\n57:48.400 --> 57:50.900\n So what would you say is the most beautiful property\n\n57:50.900 --> 57:55.900\n of these Adinkra graphs, objects?\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:58.100\n What do you think, by the way, the word symbols,\n\n57:58.100 --> 58:01.600\n what do you think of them, these simple graphs?\n\n58:01.600 --> 58:04.200\n Are they objects or?\n\n58:04.200 --> 58:06.000\n How should we think about that?\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:08.300\n For people who work with mathematics like me,\n\n58:08.300 --> 58:11.500\n our mathematical concepts are,\n\n58:11.500 --> 58:13.000\n we often refer to them as objects\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.200\n because they feel like real things.\n\n58:15.200 --> 58:17.800\n Even though you can't see them or touch them,\n\n58:17.800 --> 58:21.000\n they're so much part of your interior life\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.700\n that it is as if you could.\n\n58:23.700 --> 58:26.000\n So we often refer to these things as objects,\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:28.400\n even though there's nothing objective about them.\n\n58:28.400 --> 58:31.600\n And what does a single graph represent in space?\n\n58:31.600 --> 58:34.000\n Okay, so the simplest of these graphs\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:36.600\n has to have one white ball and one black ball.\n\n58:36.600 --> 58:38.400\n That's that balance that we talked about earlier.\n\n58:38.400 --> 58:40.200\n Remember, we want to balance out the quadrants?\n\n58:40.200 --> 58:42.200\n Well, you can't do it unless you have\n\n58:42.200 --> 58:43.800\n a black ball and white ball.\n\n58:43.800 --> 58:46.800\n So the simplest of these objects looks like two little balls,\n\n58:46.800 --> 58:49.400\n one black, one white, connected by a single line.\n\n58:49.400 --> 58:51.800\n And what it's talking about is, as I said,\n\n58:51.800 --> 58:54.700\n a deep mathematical property related to symmetry.\n\n58:54.700 --> 58:56.300\n You've mentioned the error correcting codes,\n\n58:56.300 --> 58:58.500\n but is there a particular beautiful property\n\n58:58.500 --> 59:00.400\n that stands out to you about these objects\n\n59:00.400 --> 59:01.500\n that you just find?\n\n59:01.500 --> 59:03.100\n Yes, yes, there is.\n\n59:03.100 --> 59:04.400\n Early on in the development of it.\n\n59:04.400 --> 59:05.500\n Yes, there is.\n\n59:05.500 --> 59:08.800\n The craziest thing about these to me\n\n59:10.600 --> 59:14.200\n is that when you look at physics\n\n59:14.200 --> 59:17.000\n and try to write equations where information\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:18.600\n gets transmitted reliably,\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.200\n if you're in one of these super symmetrical systems\n\n59:22.200 --> 59:23.800\n with this extra symmetry,\n\n59:23.800 --> 59:24.900\n that doesn't happen unless there's\n\n59:24.900 --> 59:26.800\n an error correcting code present.\n\n59:26.800 --> 59:29.100\n So it's as if the universe says,\n\n59:29.100 --> 59:31.000\n you don't retransmit information\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.200\n unless there's something about an error correcting code.\n\n59:33.200 --> 59:35.200\n This to me is the craziest thing\n\n59:35.200 --> 59:38.300\n that I've ever personally encountered in my research.\n\n59:38.300 --> 59:41.000\n And it's actually got me to wondering\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:42.400\n how this could come about,\n\n59:42.400 --> 59:44.500\n because the only place in nature\n\n59:44.500 --> 59:47.500\n that we know about error correcting codes is genetics.\n\n59:47.500 --> 59:50.100\n And in genetics, we think it was evolution\n\n59:50.100 --> 59:53.100\n that causes error correcting codes to be in genomes.\n\n59:53.100 --> 59:54.200\n And so does that mean that there was\n\n59:54.200 --> 59:55.600\n some kind of form of evolution\n\n59:55.600 --> 59:58.100\n acting on the mathematical laws of the physics\n\n59:58.100 --> 59:59.400\n of our universe?\n\n59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.500\n This is a very bizarre and strange idea.\n\n1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:02.500\n And it's something I've wondered about\n\n1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:05.300\n from time to time since making these discoveries.\n\n1:00:05.300 --> 1:00:08.100\n Do you think such an idea could be fundamental,\n\n1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:09.700\n or is it emergent throughout\n\n1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:12.200\n all the different kinds of systems?\n\n1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:15.900\n I don't know whether it's fundamental.\n\n1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:18.100\n I probably will not live to find out.\n\n1:00:18.100 --> 1:00:20.700\n This is gonna be the work of probably some future\n\n1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:22.100\n either mathematician or physicist\n\n1:00:22.100 --> 1:00:24.700\n to figure out what these things actually mean.\n\n1:00:24.700 --> 1:00:27.900\n We have to talk a bit about the magical,\n\n1:00:27.900 --> 1:00:31.300\n the mysterious string theory, super string theory.\n\n1:00:31.300 --> 1:00:32.100\n Sure.\n\n1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:35.300\n There's still maybe this aspect of it,\n\n1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:37.900\n which is there's still for me\n\n1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:39.500\n from an outsider's perspective,\n\n1:00:39.500 --> 1:00:42.000\n this fascinating heated debate.\n\n1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.600\n On the status of string theory.\n\n1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:46.600\n Can you clarify this debate,\n\n1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:48.700\n perhaps articulating the various views\n\n1:00:48.700 --> 1:00:50.700\n and say where you land on it?\n\n1:00:50.700 --> 1:00:53.200\n So first of all, I doubt that I will be able\n\n1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:55.700\n to say anything to clarify the debate\n\n1:00:55.700 --> 1:01:00.700\n around string theory for a general audience.\n\n1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:03.700\n Part of the reason is because string theory\n\n1:01:05.100 --> 1:01:08.600\n has done something I've never seen the erectal physics do.\n\n1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:10.800\n It has broken out into consciousness\n\n1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:13.400\n of the general public before we're finished.\n\n1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:15.800\n You see, string theory doesn't actually exist\n\n1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:17.100\n because when we use the word theory,\n\n1:01:17.100 --> 1:01:20.100\n we mean a particular set of attributes.\n\n1:01:20.100 --> 1:01:21.500\n In particular, it means that you have\n\n1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:23.900\n an overarching paradigm that explains\n\n1:01:23.900 --> 1:01:25.900\n what it is that you're doing.\n\n1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:29.900\n No such overarching paradigm exists for string theory.\n\n1:01:29.900 --> 1:01:31.800\n What string theory is currently\n\n1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:35.200\n is an enormously large mutually reinforcing collection\n\n1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:39.500\n of mathematical facts in which we can find no contradictions.\n\n1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:41.600\n We don't know why it's there,\n\n1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:44.700\n but we can certainly say that without challenge.\n\n1:01:44.700 --> 1:01:46.500\n Now, just because you find a piece of mathematics\n\n1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:49.200\n doesn't mean that this applies to nature.\n\n1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:53.200\n And in fact, there has been a very heated debate\n\n1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:57.200\n about whether string theory is some sort of hysteria\n\n1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:00.000\n among the community of theoretical physicists,\n\n1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.400\n or whether it has something fundamental\n\n1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:04.400\n to say about our universe.\n\n1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:07.900\n We don't yet know the answer to that question.\n\n1:02:07.900 --> 1:02:09.800\n What those of us who study string theory\n\n1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:12.300\n will tell you are things like,\n\n1:02:12.300 --> 1:02:14.700\n string theory has been extraordinarily productive\n\n1:02:14.700 --> 1:02:16.600\n in getting us to think more deeply,\n\n1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:19.500\n even about mathematics that's not string theory,\n\n1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:20.900\n but the kind of mathematics\n\n1:02:20.900 --> 1:02:23.800\n that we've used to describe elementary particles.\n\n1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:25.600\n There have been spin offs from string theory,\n\n1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.500\n and this has been going on now for two decades almost,\n\n1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:31.000\n that have allowed us, for example,\n\n1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.300\n to more accurately calculate the force between electrons\n\n1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:36.600\n with the presence of quantum mechanics.\n\n1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:39.100\n This is not something you hear about in the public.\n\n1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:40.800\n There are other similar things.\n\n1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:44.700\n That kind of property I just told you about\n\n1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:46.700\n is what's called weak strong duality,\n\n1:02:46.700 --> 1:02:48.900\n and it comes directly from string theory.\n\n1:02:48.900 --> 1:02:51.800\n There are other things such as\n\n1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:55.500\n a property called holography,\n\n1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:59.600\n which allows one to take equations\n\n1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:01.800\n and look at them on the boundary of a space,\n\n1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:04.000\n and then to know information about inside a space\n\n1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.400\n without actually doing calculations there.\n\n1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:08.000\n This has come directly from string theory.\n\n1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.500\n So there are a number of direct mathematical effects\n\n1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:14.100\n that we learn as string theory,\n\n1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:16.500\n but we take these ideas and look at math\n\n1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:18.100\n that we already know and we find suddenly\n\n1:03:18.100 --> 1:03:19.400\n we're more powerful.\n\n1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:20.700\n This is a pretty good indication\n\n1:03:20.700 --> 1:03:22.100\n there's something interesting going on\n\n1:03:22.100 --> 1:03:23.100\n with string theory itself.\n\n1:03:23.100 --> 1:03:24.300\n So it's the early days\n\n1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:25.900\n of a powerful mathematical framework.\n\n1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.200\n That's what we have right now.\n\n1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.300\n What are the big, first of all,\n\n1:03:30.300 --> 1:03:33.400\n most people will probably, which as you said,\n\n1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:35.300\n most general public would know actually\n\n1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:38.800\n what string theory is, which is at the highest level,\n\n1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:41.400\n which is a fascinating fact.\n\n1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:43.000\n Well, string theory is what they do\n\n1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.600\n on the Big Bang Theory, right?\n\n1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:49.600\n One, can you maybe describe what is string theory,\n\n1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:55.000\n and two, what are the open challenges?\n\n1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.300\n So what is string theory?\n\n1:03:57.300 --> 1:04:01.800\n Well, the simplest explanation I can provide\n\n1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:05.900\n is to go back and ask what are particles,\n\n1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:08.400\n which is the question you first asked me.\n\n1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.500\n What's the smallest thing?\n\n1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:13.800\n Yeah, what's the smallest thing?\n\n1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:18.800\n So particles, one way I try to describe particles\n\n1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:21.500\n to people is start,\n\n1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:23.600\n I want you to imagine a little ball\n\n1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:26.700\n and I want you to let the size of that ball shrink\n\n1:04:26.700 --> 1:04:28.800\n until it has no extent whatsoever,\n\n1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:30.900\n but it still has the mass of the ball.\n\n1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:34.900\n That's actually what Newton was working with\n\n1:04:34.900 --> 1:04:36.300\n when he first invented physics.\n\n1:04:36.300 --> 1:04:39.100\n He's the real inventor of the massive particle,\n\n1:04:39.100 --> 1:04:42.500\n which is this idea that underlies all of physics.\n\n1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:44.500\n So that's where we start.\n\n1:04:44.500 --> 1:04:46.700\n It's a mathematical construct\n\n1:04:46.700 --> 1:04:49.300\n that you get by taking a limit of things that you know.\n\n1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:51.900\n So what's a string?\n\n1:04:51.900 --> 1:04:54.300\n Well, in the same analogy, I would say,\n\n1:04:54.300 --> 1:04:57.300\n now I want you to start with a piece of spaghetti.\n\n1:04:57.300 --> 1:04:59.300\n So we all know what that looks like.\n\n1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:03.100\n And now I want you to let the thickness of the spaghetti\n\n1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:05.700\n shrink until it has no thickness.\n\n1:05:05.700 --> 1:05:08.300\n Mathematically, I mean, in words, this makes no sense,\n\n1:05:08.300 --> 1:05:11.300\n but mathematically, this actually works\n\n1:05:11.300 --> 1:05:13.700\n and you get this mathematical object out.\n\n1:05:13.700 --> 1:05:15.700\n It has properties that are like spaghetti.\n\n1:05:15.700 --> 1:05:17.400\n It can wiggle and jiggle,\n\n1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:19.900\n but it can also move collectively\n\n1:05:19.900 --> 1:05:21.500\n like a piece of spaghetti.\n\n1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:24.300\n It's the mathematics of those sorts of objects\n\n1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:25.900\n that constitute string theory.\n\n1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:30.900\n And does the multidimensional, 11 dimensional,\n\n1:05:30.900 --> 1:05:34.900\n however many dimensional, more than four dimension,\n\n1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:36.900\n is that a crazy idea to you?\n\n1:05:36.900 --> 1:05:40.900\n Is that the stranger aspect of string theory to you?\n\n1:05:40.900 --> 1:05:45.900\n Not really, and also partly because of my own research.\n\n1:05:45.900 --> 1:05:49.500\n So earlier we talked about these strange symbols\n\n1:05:49.500 --> 1:05:51.900\n that we've discovered inside the equations.\n\n1:05:51.900 --> 1:05:54.100\n It turns out that to a very large extent,\n\n1:05:54.100 --> 1:05:56.500\n a Dinkers don't really care about the number of dimensions.\n\n1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:59.300\n They kind of have an internal mathematical consistency\n\n1:05:59.300 --> 1:06:00.900\n that allows them to be manifested\n\n1:06:00.900 --> 1:06:02.900\n in many different dimensions.\n\n1:06:02.900 --> 1:06:05.300\n Since supersymmetry is a part of string theory,\n\n1:06:05.300 --> 1:06:07.300\n then the same property you would expect\n\n1:06:07.300 --> 1:06:09.300\n to be inherited by string theory.\n\n1:06:09.300 --> 1:06:12.300\n However, another little known fact,\n\n1:06:12.300 --> 1:06:14.100\n which is not in the public debate,\n\n1:06:14.100 --> 1:06:15.700\n is that there are actually strings\n\n1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:17.700\n that are only four dimensional.\n\n1:06:17.700 --> 1:06:19.300\n This is something that was discovered\n\n1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:23.300\n at the end of the 80s by a scientist,\n\n1:06:23.300 --> 1:06:25.300\n by three different groups of physicists\n\n1:06:25.300 --> 1:06:27.300\n working independently.\n\n1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:29.100\n I and my friend Warren Siegel,\n\n1:06:29.100 --> 1:06:31.100\n who were at the University of Maryland at the time,\n\n1:06:31.100 --> 1:06:33.300\n were able to prove that there's mathematics\n\n1:06:33.300 --> 1:06:34.500\n that looks totally four dimensional,\n\n1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:36.100\n and yet it's a string.\n\n1:06:36.100 --> 1:06:37.700\n There was a group in Germany\n\n1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:40.300\n that used slightly different mathematics,\n\n1:06:40.300 --> 1:06:42.100\n but they found the same result.\n\n1:06:42.100 --> 1:06:43.900\n And then there was a group at Cornell\n\n1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:46.100\n who using yet a third piece of mathematics\n\n1:06:46.100 --> 1:06:46.900\n found the same result.\n\n1:06:46.900 --> 1:06:49.900\n So the fact that extra dimensions\n\n1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:53.700\n is so widely talked about in the public\n\n1:06:53.700 --> 1:06:55.700\n is partly a function of how the public\n\n1:06:55.700 --> 1:06:57.300\n has come to understand string theory\n\n1:06:57.300 --> 1:06:59.500\n and how the story has been told to them.\n\n1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:02.500\n But there are alternatives you don't know about.\n\n1:07:02.500 --> 1:07:06.300\n If we could talk about maybe experimental validation,\n\n1:07:06.300 --> 1:07:11.300\n and you're the coauthor of a recently published book,\n\n1:07:11.300 --> 1:07:14.500\n Proving Einstein Right,\n\n1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.300\n the human story of it too,\n\n1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:18.100\n the daring expeditions that change\n\n1:07:18.100 --> 1:07:19.900\n how we look at the universe.\n\n1:07:19.900 --> 1:07:22.100\n Do you see echoes of the early days\n\n1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:25.700\n of general relativity in the 1910s\n\n1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:29.900\n to the more stretched out to string theory?\n\n1:07:29.900 --> 1:07:31.100\n I do, I do.\n\n1:07:31.100 --> 1:07:33.500\n And that's one reason why I was happy to focus\n\n1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:38.500\n on the story of how Einstein became a global superstar.\n\n1:07:43.700 --> 1:07:45.500\n Earlier in our discussion,\n\n1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:50.500\n we went over his history where in 1915,\n\n1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:53.900\n he came up with this piece of mathematics,\n\n1:07:53.900 --> 1:07:55.700\n used it to do some calculations\n\n1:07:55.700 --> 1:07:57.060\n and then made a prediction.\n\n1:07:57.060 --> 1:07:58.020\n Yes.\n\n1:07:58.020 --> 1:08:00.180\n But making a prediction is not enough.\n\n1:08:00.180 --> 1:08:02.060\n Someone's got to go out and measure.\n\n1:08:02.940 --> 1:08:07.020\n And so string theory is in that in between zone.\n\n1:08:07.020 --> 1:08:09.940\n Now for Einstein, it was from 1915 to 1919.\n\n1:08:09.940 --> 1:08:14.380\n 1915 he makes the correct prediction.\n\n1:08:14.380 --> 1:08:16.420\n By the way, he made an incorrect prediction\n\n1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:17.780\n about the same thing in 1911,\n\n1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:20.340\n but he corrected himself in 1915.\n\n1:08:20.340 --> 1:08:22.420\n And by 1919, the first pieces\n\n1:08:22.420 --> 1:08:27.420\n of experimental observational data became available\n\n1:08:27.620 --> 1:08:31.020\n to say, yes, he's not wrong.\n\n1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:35.940\n And by 1922, the argument that based on observation\n\n1:08:35.940 --> 1:08:38.500\n was overwhelming that he was not wrong.\n\n1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:41.860\n Can you describe what special general relativity are\n\n1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:42.700\n just briefly?\n\n1:08:42.700 --> 1:08:43.540\n Sure.\n\n1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:45.580\n And what prediction Einstein made\n\n1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:50.580\n and maybe some or a memorable moment\n\n1:08:52.580 --> 1:08:56.980\n from the human journey of trying to prove this thing right,\n\n1:08:56.980 --> 1:08:58.060\n which is incredible.\n\n1:08:58.060 --> 1:08:58.900\n Right.\n\n1:08:58.900 --> 1:09:02.580\n So I'm very fortunate to have worked\n\n1:09:02.580 --> 1:09:07.580\n with a talented novelist who wanted to write a book\n\n1:09:07.820 --> 1:09:09.740\n that coincided with a book I wanted to write\n\n1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:14.740\n about how science kind of feels if you're a person,\n\n1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:17.140\n because it's actually people who do science,\n\n1:09:17.140 --> 1:09:19.740\n even though that may not be obvious to everyone.\n\n1:09:20.780 --> 1:09:22.660\n So for me, I wanted to write this book\n\n1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:23.660\n for a couple of reasons.\n\n1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:26.460\n I wanted young people to understand\n\n1:09:26.460 --> 1:09:31.460\n that the seeming alien giants that live before them\n\n1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:34.060\n were just as human as they are.\n\n1:09:34.060 --> 1:09:35.780\n They get married, they get divorced.\n\n1:09:35.780 --> 1:09:37.100\n They get married, they get divorced.\n\n1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:38.500\n They do terrible things.\n\n1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:39.580\n They do great things.\n\n1:09:39.580 --> 1:09:40.420\n They're people.\n\n1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:42.180\n They're just people like you.\n\n1:09:42.180 --> 1:09:44.420\n And so that part of telling the story allowed me\n\n1:09:44.420 --> 1:09:47.020\n to get that out there for both young people interested\n\n1:09:47.020 --> 1:09:49.540\n in the sciences as well as the public.\n\n1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:54.180\n But the other part of the story is I wanted to open up\n\n1:09:54.180 --> 1:09:58.580\n sort of what it was like.\n\n1:09:58.580 --> 1:10:00.460\n Now I'm a scientist.\n\n1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:02.660\n And so I will not pretend to be a great writer.\n\n1:10:02.660 --> 1:10:04.700\n I understand a lot about mathematics\n\n1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:07.100\n and I've even created my own mathematics\n\n1:10:07.100 --> 1:10:11.980\n that is kind of a weird thing to be able to do.\n\n1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:13.980\n But in order to tell the story,\n\n1:10:13.980 --> 1:10:18.100\n you really have to have an incredible master\n\n1:10:18.100 --> 1:10:19.900\n of the narrative.\n\n1:10:19.900 --> 1:10:22.540\n And that was my coauthor, Kathy Pelletier,\n\n1:10:22.540 --> 1:10:24.060\n who is a novelist.\n\n1:10:24.060 --> 1:10:27.620\n So we formed this conjoined brain, I used to call us.\n\n1:10:27.620 --> 1:10:30.100\n She used to call us Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle.\n\n1:10:30.100 --> 1:10:33.220\n My expression for us is that we were a conjoined brain\n\n1:10:33.220 --> 1:10:34.980\n to tell this story.\n\n1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:39.740\n And it allowed, so what are some magical moments?\n\n1:10:39.740 --> 1:10:43.900\n To me, the first magical moment in telling the story\n\n1:10:43.900 --> 1:10:48.460\n was looking at Albert Einstein and his struggle\n\n1:10:48.460 --> 1:10:51.700\n because although we regard him as a genius,\n\n1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:54.460\n as I said, in 1911, he actually made an incorrect prediction\n\n1:10:54.460 --> 1:10:55.660\n about bending starlight.\n\n1:10:55.660 --> 1:10:58.060\n And that's actually what set the astronomers off.\n\n1:10:59.780 --> 1:11:02.220\n In 1914, there was an eclipse.\n\n1:11:02.220 --> 1:11:06.220\n And by various accidents of war and weather\n\n1:11:06.220 --> 1:11:08.860\n and all sorts of things that we talk about in the book,\n\n1:11:08.860 --> 1:11:11.100\n no one was able to make the measurement.\n\n1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:13.580\n If they had made the measurement,\n\n1:11:13.580 --> 1:11:18.580\n it would have disagreed with his 1911 prediction\n\n1:11:19.460 --> 1:11:22.020\n because nature only has one answer.\n\n1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:26.020\n And so then you see how fortunate he was\n\n1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:32.740\n that wars and bad weather and accidents and transporting\n\n1:11:32.740 --> 1:11:35.860\n equipment stopped any measurements from being made.\n\n1:11:35.860 --> 1:11:38.780\n So he corrects himself in 1915,\n\n1:11:38.780 --> 1:11:40.180\n but the astronomers are already out there\n\n1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:41.700\n trying to make the measurement.\n\n1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:43.460\n So now he gives them a different number.\n\n1:11:43.460 --> 1:11:46.620\n And it turns out that's the number that nature agrees with.\n\n1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:50.540\n So it gives you a sense of this is a person struggling\n\n1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:52.180\n with something deeply.\n\n1:11:52.180 --> 1:11:56.860\n And although his deep insight led him to this,\n\n1:11:56.860 --> 1:12:01.260\n it is the circumstance of time, place and accident\n\n1:12:01.260 --> 1:12:03.740\n but through which we view him.\n\n1:12:03.740 --> 1:12:06.980\n And the story could have turned out very differently\n\n1:12:06.980 --> 1:12:09.620\n where first he makes a prediction,\n\n1:12:09.620 --> 1:12:11.900\n the measurements are made in 1914,\n\n1:12:11.900 --> 1:12:13.580\n they disagree with his prediction.\n\n1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:15.620\n And so what would the world view him as?\n\n1:12:15.620 --> 1:12:17.540\n Well, he's this professor who made this prediction\n\n1:12:17.540 --> 1:12:20.540\n that didn't get it right, yes?\n\n1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:26.220\n So the fragility of human history\n\n1:12:26.220 --> 1:12:27.620\n is illustrated by that story.\n\n1:12:27.620 --> 1:12:29.540\n And it's one of my favorite things.\n\n1:12:29.540 --> 1:12:32.460\n You also learn things like in our book,\n\n1:12:32.460 --> 1:12:36.180\n how eclipses and watching eclipses was a driver\n\n1:12:36.180 --> 1:12:37.940\n of the development of science in our nation\n\n1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:38.780\n when it was very young.\n\n1:12:38.780 --> 1:12:40.620\n In fact, even before we were a nation,\n\n1:12:40.620 --> 1:12:47.180\n it turns out there were citizens of this would be country\n\n1:12:47.180 --> 1:12:50.580\n that were going out trying to measure eclipses.\n\n1:12:50.580 --> 1:12:54.820\n So some fortune, some misfortune affects\n\n1:12:54.820 --> 1:12:56.740\n the progress of science.\n\n1:12:56.740 --> 1:12:57.660\n Absolutely.\n\n1:12:57.660 --> 1:13:01.740\n Especially with ideas as, to me at least,\n\n1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:03.620\n if I put myself back in those days,\n\n1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:08.380\n as radical as general relativity is.\n\n1:13:08.380 --> 1:13:12.100\n First, can you describe, if it's OK briefly,\n\n1:13:12.100 --> 1:13:14.180\n what general relativity is?\n\n1:13:14.180 --> 1:13:18.500\n And yeah, could you just take a moment of, yeah,\n\n1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:22.460\n put yourself in those shoes in the academic researchers,\n\n1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:25.180\n scientists of that time, and what is this theory?\n\n1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:28.660\n What is it trying to describe about our world?\n\n1:13:28.660 --> 1:13:34.740\n It's trying to answer the thing that left Isaac Newton puzzled.\n\n1:13:37.620 --> 1:13:39.740\n Isaac Newton says gravity magically\n\n1:13:39.740 --> 1:13:41.700\n goes from one place to another.\n\n1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:43.300\n He doesn't believe it, by the way.\n\n1:13:43.300 --> 1:13:45.340\n He knows that's not right.\n\n1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:48.220\n But the mathematics is so good that you have to say,\n\n1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:52.020\n well, I'll throw my qualms away because I'll use it.\n\n1:13:52.020 --> 1:13:55.020\n That's all we used to get a man from the Earth to the moon\n\n1:13:55.020 --> 1:13:58.420\n was that mathematics.\n\n1:13:58.420 --> 1:14:03.460\n So I'm one of those scientists, and I've seen this.\n\n1:14:03.460 --> 1:14:04.860\n And if I thought deeply about it,\n\n1:14:04.860 --> 1:14:08.700\n maybe I know that Newton himself wasn't comfortable.\n\n1:14:08.700 --> 1:14:11.100\n And so the first thing I would hope that I would feel\n\n1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:13.300\n is, gee, there's this young kid out there who\n\n1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:17.820\n has an idea to fill in this hole that was left with us\n\n1:14:17.820 --> 1:14:19.780\n by Sir Isaac Newton.\n\n1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:23.100\n That, I hope, would be my reaction.\n\n1:14:23.100 --> 1:14:24.820\n I have a suspicion.\n\n1:14:24.820 --> 1:14:29.020\n I'm kind of a mathematical creature.\n\n1:14:29.020 --> 1:14:30.300\n I was four years old when I first\n\n1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:33.700\n decided that science was what I wanted to do with my life.\n\n1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:38.820\n And so if my personality back then was like it is now,\n\n1:14:38.820 --> 1:14:41.180\n I think it's probably likely I would\n\n1:14:41.180 --> 1:14:43.620\n want to have studied his mathematics.\n\n1:14:43.620 --> 1:14:45.380\n What was a piece of mathematics that he was\n\n1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:47.660\n using to make this prediction?\n\n1:14:47.660 --> 1:14:50.060\n Because he didn't actually create that mathematics.\n\n1:14:50.060 --> 1:14:52.180\n That mathematics was created roughly 50 years\n\n1:14:52.180 --> 1:14:53.300\n before he lived.\n\n1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:56.420\n He's the person who harnessed it in order\n\n1:14:56.420 --> 1:14:57.260\n to make a prediction.\n\n1:14:57.260 --> 1:15:00.780\n In fact, he had to be taught this mathematics by a friend.\n\n1:15:00.780 --> 1:15:03.700\n So this is in our book.\n\n1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:08.140\n So putting myself in that time, I would want to, like I said,\n\n1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:09.340\n I think I would feel excitement.\n\n1:15:09.340 --> 1:15:10.900\n I would want to know what the mathematics is.\n\n1:15:10.900 --> 1:15:13.580\n And then I would want to do the calculations myself.\n\n1:15:13.580 --> 1:15:16.660\n Because one thing that physics is all about\n\n1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:19.420\n is that you don't have to take anybody's word for anything.\n\n1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:20.980\n You can do it yourself.\n\n1:15:20.980 --> 1:15:23.060\n It does seem that mathematics is a little bit more\n\n1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:25.540\n tolerant of radical ideas, or mathematicians,\n\n1:15:25.540 --> 1:15:28.580\n or people who find beauty in mathematics.\n\n1:15:31.780 --> 1:15:33.620\n All the white questions have no good answer.\n\n1:15:33.620 --> 1:15:35.860\n But let me ask, why do you think Einstein never\n\n1:15:35.860 --> 1:15:38.540\n got the Nobel Prize for general relativity?\n\n1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:40.260\n He got it for the photoelectric effect.\n\n1:15:40.260 --> 1:15:41.020\n That is correct.\n\n1:15:41.020 --> 1:15:42.860\n Well, first of all, that's something\n\n1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:46.060\n that is misunderstood about the Nobel Prize in physics.\n\n1:15:46.060 --> 1:15:48.620\n The Nobel Prize in physics is never\n\n1:15:48.620 --> 1:15:54.060\n given for purely proposing an idea.\n\n1:15:54.060 --> 1:15:57.420\n It is always given for proposing an idea that\n\n1:15:57.420 --> 1:15:59.700\n has observational support.\n\n1:15:59.700 --> 1:16:02.340\n So he could not get the Nobel Prize\n\n1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:05.300\n for either special relativity nor general relativity,\n\n1:16:05.300 --> 1:16:08.700\n because the provisions that Alfred Nobel left for the award\n\n1:16:08.700 --> 1:16:11.060\n prevent that.\n\n1:16:11.060 --> 1:16:16.100\n But after it's been validated, can he not get it then, or no?\n\n1:16:16.100 --> 1:16:19.540\n Yes, but remember the validation doesn't really\n\n1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:21.820\n come until the 1920s.\n\n1:16:21.820 --> 1:16:24.500\n But that's why they invented the second Nobel Prize.\n\n1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:28.140\n I mean, Marie Curie, you can get a second Nobel Prize\n\n1:16:28.140 --> 1:16:31.540\n for one of the greatest theories in physics.\n\n1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:33.740\n So let's be clear on this.\n\n1:16:33.740 --> 1:16:39.780\n The theory of general relativity had its critics\n\n1:16:39.780 --> 1:16:43.020\n even up until the 50s.\n\n1:16:43.020 --> 1:16:47.820\n So if the committee had wanted to give\n\n1:16:47.820 --> 1:16:50.300\n the prize for general relativity,\n\n1:16:50.300 --> 1:16:54.180\n there were vociferous critics of general relativity\n\n1:16:54.180 --> 1:16:56.740\n up until the 50s.\n\n1:16:56.740 --> 1:16:59.740\n Einstein died in 1955.\n\n1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:04.300\n What lessons do you draw from the story you tell in the book,\n\n1:17:04.300 --> 1:17:07.060\n from general relativity, from the radical nature\n\n1:17:07.060 --> 1:17:12.900\n of the theory, to looking at the future of string theory?\n\n1:17:12.900 --> 1:17:14.980\n Well, I think that the string theorists are probably\n\n1:17:14.980 --> 1:17:17.900\n going to retrace this path.\n\n1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:20.020\n But it's going to be far longer and more torturous,\n\n1:17:20.020 --> 1:17:22.140\n in my opinion.\n\n1:17:22.140 --> 1:17:29.140\n String theory is such a broad and deep development\n\n1:17:29.140 --> 1:17:34.180\n that, in my opinion, when it becomes acceptable,\n\n1:17:34.180 --> 1:17:38.060\n it's going to be because of a confluence of observations.\n\n1:17:38.060 --> 1:17:40.620\n It's not going to be a single observation.\n\n1:17:40.620 --> 1:17:44.620\n And I have to tell you that, so I gave a seminar here\n\n1:17:44.620 --> 1:17:46.500\n yesterday at MIT.\n\n1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:50.860\n And it's on an idea I have about how string theory can\n\n1:17:50.860 --> 1:17:53.980\n leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background, which\n\n1:17:53.980 --> 1:17:56.860\n is an astrophysical structure.\n\n1:17:56.860 --> 1:18:01.580\n And so if those kinds of observations are borne out,\n\n1:18:01.580 --> 1:18:05.580\n if perhaps other things related to the idea of supersymmetry\n\n1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:08.900\n are borne out, those are going to be the first powerful\n\n1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:12.340\n observationally based pieces of evidence that\n\n1:18:12.340 --> 1:18:18.060\n will begin to do what the Eddington expedition did\n\n1:18:18.060 --> 1:18:19.620\n in 1919.\n\n1:18:19.620 --> 1:18:22.900\n But that may take several decades.\n\n1:18:22.900 --> 1:18:25.060\n Do you think there will be Nobel prizes given\n\n1:18:25.060 --> 1:18:26.220\n for string theory?\n\n1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:34.980\n No, because I think it will exceed normal human lifetimes.\n\n1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:38.140\n But there are other prizes that are given.\n\n1:18:38.140 --> 1:18:42.220\n I mean, there is something called the Breakthrough Prize.\n\n1:18:42.220 --> 1:18:45.020\n There's a Russian immigrant, a Russian American immigrant\n\n1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:48.420\n named Yuri Milner, I believe his name,\n\n1:18:48.420 --> 1:18:53.020\n started this wonderful prize called the Breakthrough Prize.\n\n1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:56.100\n It's three times as much money as the Nobel Prize.\n\n1:18:56.100 --> 1:18:58.100\n And it gets awarded every year.\n\n1:18:58.100 --> 1:19:00.300\n And so something like one of those prizes\n\n1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:04.020\n is likely to be garnered at some point far earlier\n\n1:19:04.020 --> 1:19:07.660\n than a Nobel award.\n\n1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:09.780\n Jumping around a few topics.\n\n1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:11.900\n While you were at Caltech, you've\n\n1:19:11.900 --> 1:19:15.340\n gotten to interact, I believe, with Richard Feynman,\n\n1:19:15.340 --> 1:19:16.300\n I have to ask.\n\n1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:19.100\n Yes, Richard Feynman, indeed.\n\n1:19:19.100 --> 1:19:20.540\n Do you have any stories that stand out\n\n1:19:20.540 --> 1:19:21.660\n in your memory of that time?\n\n1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:23.660\n I have a fair number of stories, but I'm not\n\n1:19:23.660 --> 1:19:24.980\n prepared to tell them.\n\n1:19:24.980 --> 1:19:26.820\n They're not all politically correct.\n\n1:19:26.820 --> 1:19:28.620\n Let me see.\n\n1:19:28.620 --> 1:19:31.060\n Let me just say, I'll say the following.\n\n1:19:31.060 --> 1:19:33.980\n Richard Feynman, if you've ever read\n\n1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:36.420\n some of the books about him, in particular,\n\n1:19:36.420 --> 1:19:38.980\n there's a book called Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman.\n\n1:19:38.980 --> 1:19:42.140\n There's a series of books that starts with Surely You're\n\n1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:43.180\n Joking, Mr. Feynman.\n\n1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:45.760\n And I think the second one may be something like What Do You\n\n1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:47.260\n Care What They Say or something.\n\n1:19:47.260 --> 1:19:49.620\n I mean, the titles are all, there are three of them.\n\n1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:53.820\n When I read those books, I was amazed at how accurately\n\n1:19:53.820 --> 1:19:57.180\n those books portrayed the man that I interacted with.\n\n1:19:57.180 --> 1:20:01.620\n He was irreverent, he was fun, he was deeply intelligent,\n\n1:20:01.620 --> 1:20:03.620\n he was deeply human.\n\n1:20:03.620 --> 1:20:07.300\n And those books tell that story very effectively.\n\n1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:09.540\n Even just those moments, how did they\n\n1:20:09.540 --> 1:20:12.100\n affect you as a physicist?\n\n1:20:12.100 --> 1:20:15.380\n Well, one of the, well, it's funny because one\n\n1:20:15.380 --> 1:20:20.460\n of the things that, I didn't hear Feynman say this,\n\n1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:25.580\n but one of the things that is reported that he said\n\n1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:29.600\n is if you're in a bar stool as a physicist,\n\n1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:31.740\n and you can't explain to the guy on the bar stool\n\n1:20:31.740 --> 1:20:33.060\n next to you what you're doing, you\n\n1:20:33.060 --> 1:20:35.660\n don't understand what you're doing.\n\n1:20:35.660 --> 1:20:40.580\n And there's a lot of that that I think is correct,\n\n1:20:40.580 --> 1:20:47.580\n that when you truly understand something as complicated\n\n1:20:47.580 --> 1:20:53.700\n as string theory, when it's in its fully formed final\n\n1:20:53.700 --> 1:20:55.620\n development, it should be something\n\n1:20:55.620 --> 1:20:58.980\n you could tell to the person on the bar stool next to you.\n\n1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:03.300\n And that's something that affects the way I do science,\n\n1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:04.900\n quite frankly.\n\n1:21:04.900 --> 1:21:08.180\n It also affects the way I talk to the public about science.\n\n1:21:08.180 --> 1:21:11.460\n It's one of my mantras that I keep deeply,\n\n1:21:11.460 --> 1:21:15.980\n and try to keep deeply before me when I appear in public fora\n\n1:21:15.980 --> 1:21:20.020\n speaking about physics in particular and science\n\n1:21:20.020 --> 1:21:21.060\n in general.\n\n1:21:21.060 --> 1:21:22.460\n It's also something that Einstein\n\n1:21:22.460 --> 1:21:23.580\n said in a different way.\n\n1:21:23.580 --> 1:21:27.200\n He said he had these two different formulations.\n\n1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:31.820\n One of them is when the answer is simple, it's God speaking.\n\n1:21:31.820 --> 1:21:33.700\n And the other thing that he said was\n\n1:21:33.700 --> 1:21:37.580\n that what he did in his work was simply\n\n1:21:37.580 --> 1:21:40.620\n the distillation of common sense,\n\n1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:43.620\n that you distill down to something.\n\n1:21:43.620 --> 1:21:45.940\n And he also said you make things as simple as possible\n\n1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:47.860\n but no simpler.\n\n1:21:47.860 --> 1:21:50.820\n So all of those things, and certainly this attitude for me\n\n1:21:50.820 --> 1:21:53.380\n first seeing this was exemplified\n\n1:21:53.380 --> 1:21:55.260\n by being around Richard Feynman.\n\n1:21:55.260 --> 1:21:56.900\n So in all your work, you're always\n\n1:21:56.900 --> 1:21:59.220\n searching for the simplicity, for the simple, clear.\n\n1:21:59.220 --> 1:22:00.140\n I am, ultimately.\n\n1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:01.980\n Ultimately, I am.\n\n1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:05.660\n You served President Barack Obama's Council of Advisors\n\n1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:07.660\n in Science and Technology.\n\n1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:08.700\n For seven years, yes.\n\n1:22:08.700 --> 1:22:11.260\n For seven years with Eric Schmidt\n\n1:22:11.260 --> 1:22:13.380\n and several other brilliant people?\n\n1:22:13.380 --> 1:22:17.580\n Met Eric for the first time in 2009\n\n1:22:17.580 --> 1:22:19.820\n when the council was called together.\n\n1:22:19.820 --> 1:22:21.420\n Yeah, I've seen pictures of you in that room.\n\n1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:23.020\n I mean, there's a bunch of brilliant people.\n\n1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:24.420\n It kind of looks amazing.\n\n1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:27.340\n What was that experience like, being called\n\n1:22:27.340 --> 1:22:29.300\n upon that kind of service?\n\n1:22:29.300 --> 1:22:31.580\n So let me go back to my father, first of all.\n\n1:22:31.580 --> 1:22:34.020\n I earlier mentioned that my father served 27 years\n\n1:22:34.020 --> 1:22:37.020\n in the US Army, starting in World War II.\n\n1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:42.820\n He went off in 1942, 43 to fight against the fascists.\n\n1:22:42.820 --> 1:22:45.380\n He was part of the supply corps that\n\n1:22:45.380 --> 1:22:47.580\n supplied General Patton as the tanks rolled\n\n1:22:47.580 --> 1:22:51.860\n across Western Europe, pushing back the forces of Nazism\n\n1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:54.980\n to meet up with our Russian comrades\n\n1:22:54.980 --> 1:22:59.620\n who were pushing the Nazis starting in Stalingrad.\n\n1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:02.420\n And the Second World War is actually\n\n1:23:02.420 --> 1:23:06.060\n a very interesting piece of history\n\n1:23:06.060 --> 1:23:08.460\n to know from both sides.\n\n1:23:08.460 --> 1:23:09.980\n Here in America, we typically don't.\n\n1:23:09.980 --> 1:23:12.500\n But I've actually studied history as an adult.\n\n1:23:12.500 --> 1:23:14.500\n So I actually know sort of the whole story.\n\n1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.860\n And on the Russian side, we don't know the Americans.\n\n1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:19.260\n We weren't taught the American side of the story.\n\n1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:20.020\n I know.\n\n1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:22.820\n I have many Russian friends, and we've\n\n1:23:22.820 --> 1:23:24.420\n had this conversation on many occasions.\n\n1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:25.140\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:23:25.140 --> 1:23:27.260\n But you know, like General Zhukov, for example,\n\n1:23:27.260 --> 1:23:28.620\n was something that you wouldn't know about,\n\n1:23:28.620 --> 1:23:30.100\n but you might not know about a Patton.\n\n1:23:30.100 --> 1:23:30.860\n But you're right.\n\n1:23:30.860 --> 1:23:34.980\n So Georgy Zhukov or Rokossovsky, I mean,\n\n1:23:34.980 --> 1:23:36.820\n there's a whole list of names that I've\n\n1:23:36.820 --> 1:23:39.180\n learned in the last 15 or 20 years looking\n\n1:23:39.180 --> 1:23:41.020\n at the Second World War.\n\n1:23:41.020 --> 1:23:44.340\n So your father was in the midst of that,\n\n1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:46.500\n probably one of the greatest wars in history.\n\n1:23:46.500 --> 1:23:49.860\n In the history of our species.\n\n1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:54.540\n And so the idea of service comes to me essentially\n\n1:23:54.540 --> 1:23:57.660\n from that example.\n\n1:23:57.660 --> 1:24:06.020\n So in 2009, when I first got a call from a Nobel laureate\n\n1:24:06.020 --> 1:24:09.940\n actually in biology, Harold Varmus,\n\n1:24:09.940 --> 1:24:13.660\n I was on my way to India, and I got this email message,\n\n1:24:13.660 --> 1:24:15.580\n and he said he needed to talk to me.\n\n1:24:15.580 --> 1:24:18.140\n And I said, OK, fine, we can talk.\n\n1:24:18.140 --> 1:24:20.180\n Got back to States I didn't hear from him.\n\n1:24:20.180 --> 1:24:22.300\n We went through several cycles of this, sending me a message,\n\n1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:24.860\n I want to talk to you, and then him never contacting us.\n\n1:24:24.860 --> 1:24:28.180\n Finally, I was on my way to give a physics presentation\n\n1:24:28.180 --> 1:24:29.860\n at the University of Florida in Gainesville,\n\n1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:34.700\n and Jess had stepped off a plane,\n\n1:24:34.700 --> 1:24:37.180\n and my mobile phone went off, and it was Harold.\n\n1:24:37.180 --> 1:24:40.460\n And so I said, Harold, why do you keep sending me messages\n\n1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:43.180\n that you want to talk but you never call?\n\n1:24:43.180 --> 1:24:45.380\n And he said, well, I'm sorry, things have been hectic\n\n1:24:45.380 --> 1:24:47.340\n and da, da, da, da, da.\n\n1:24:47.340 --> 1:24:51.020\n And then he said, if you were offered the opportunity\n\n1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:55.180\n to serve on the US President's Council of Advisors\n\n1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:59.420\n on Science and Technology, what would be your answer?\n\n1:24:59.420 --> 1:25:02.500\n I was amused at the formulation of the question,\n\n1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:06.060\n because it's clear there's a purpose of why the question is\n\n1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:07.540\n asked that way.\n\n1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:12.500\n But then he made it clear to me he wasn't joking.\n\n1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:15.220\n And literally, one of the few times in my life,\n\n1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:19.020\n my knees went weak and I had to hold myself up\n\n1:25:19.020 --> 1:25:21.340\n against a wall so that I didn't fall over.\n\n1:25:23.100 --> 1:25:28.100\n I doubt if most of us who have been the beneficiaries\n\n1:25:28.300 --> 1:25:29.940\n of the benefits of this country,\n\n1:25:31.220 --> 1:25:34.900\n when given that kind of opportunity, could say no.\n\n1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:37.820\n And I know I certainly couldn't say no.\n\n1:25:37.820 --> 1:25:42.660\n I was frightened out of my wits because I had never,\n\n1:25:43.700 --> 1:25:48.700\n although I have, my career in terms of policy recommendations\n\n1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:52.620\n is actually quite long, it goes back to the 80s,\n\n1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:57.620\n but I had never been called upon to serve as an advisor\n\n1:25:57.620 --> 1:26:00.780\n to a president of the United States.\n\n1:26:00.780 --> 1:26:05.780\n And it was very scary, but I did not feel that I could say no\n\n1:26:06.780 --> 1:26:10.420\n because I wouldn't be able to sleep with myself at night\n\n1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:13.740\n saying that I chickened out or whatever.\n\n1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:19.180\n And so I took the plunge and we had a pretty good run.\n\n1:26:19.180 --> 1:26:23.180\n There are things that I did in those seven years\n\n1:26:23.180 --> 1:26:28.380\n of which I'm extraordinarily proud.\n\n1:26:28.380 --> 1:26:30.660\n One of the ways I tell people is if you've ever seen\n\n1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:34.100\n that television cartoon called Schoolhouse Rock,\n\n1:26:34.100 --> 1:26:37.140\n there's this one story about how a bill becomes a law.\n\n1:26:37.140 --> 1:26:38.540\n And I've kind of lived that.\n\n1:26:38.540 --> 1:26:41.060\n There are things that I did\n\n1:26:41.060 --> 1:26:43.620\n that have now been codified in US law.\n\n1:26:44.620 --> 1:26:47.820\n Not everybody gets a chance to do things like that in life.\n\n1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:50.660\n What do you think is the, science and technology,\n\n1:26:50.660 --> 1:26:53.780\n especially in American politics,\n\n1:26:53.780 --> 1:26:58.300\n we haven't had a president who's an engineer or a scientist.\n\n1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:01.660\n What do you think is the role of a president like President Obama\n\n1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:05.500\n in understanding the latest ideas in science and tech?\n\n1:27:05.500 --> 1:27:06.820\n What was that experience like?\n\n1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:09.660\n Well, first of all, I've met other presidents\n\n1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:10.820\n beside President Obama.\n\n1:27:10.820 --> 1:27:12.740\n He is the most extraordinary president\n\n1:27:12.740 --> 1:27:15.220\n that I've ever encountered.\n\n1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:18.180\n Despite the fact that he went to Harvard.\n\n1:27:18.180 --> 1:27:21.300\n When I think about President Obama,\n\n1:27:21.300 --> 1:27:23.540\n he is a deep mystery to me.\n\n1:27:23.540 --> 1:27:27.180\n In the same way perhaps that the universe is a mystery.\n\n1:27:27.180 --> 1:27:29.780\n I don't really understand how that constellation\n\n1:27:29.780 --> 1:27:34.020\n of personality traits could come to fit\n\n1:27:34.020 --> 1:27:35.700\n within a single individual.\n\n1:27:35.700 --> 1:27:38.060\n But I saw them for seven years.\n\n1:27:38.060 --> 1:27:41.140\n So I'm convinced that I wasn't seeing fake news.\n\n1:27:41.140 --> 1:27:42.620\n I was seeing real data.\n\n1:27:42.620 --> 1:27:44.780\n He was just an extraordinary man.\n\n1:27:44.780 --> 1:27:48.620\n And one of the things that was completely clear\n\n1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:55.620\n was that he was not afraid and not intimidated\n\n1:27:55.620 --> 1:27:58.260\n to be in a room of really smart people.\n\n1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:00.900\n I mean, really smart people.\n\n1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:06.380\n That he was completely comfortable in asking\n\n1:28:06.380 --> 1:28:07.940\n some of the world's greatest experts,\n\n1:28:07.940 --> 1:28:09.860\n what do I do about this problem?\n\n1:28:09.860 --> 1:28:12.500\n And it wasn't that he was going to just take the problem\n\n1:28:12.500 --> 1:28:15.460\n and it wasn't that he was going to just take their answer,\n\n1:28:15.460 --> 1:28:18.340\n but he would listen to the advice.\n\n1:28:18.340 --> 1:28:21.060\n And that to me was extraordinary.\n\n1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:23.020\n As I said, I've been around other executives\n\n1:28:23.020 --> 1:28:27.020\n and I've never seen one quite like him.\n\n1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:30.260\n He's an extraordinary learner, is what I observed.\n\n1:28:30.260 --> 1:28:32.940\n And not just about science.\n\n1:28:32.940 --> 1:28:36.700\n He has a way of internalizing information in real time\n\n1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:39.100\n that I've never seen in a politician before.\n\n1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:42.460\n Even in extraordinarily complicated situations.\n\n1:28:42.460 --> 1:28:43.700\n Even scientific ideas.\n\n1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:45.060\n Scientific or non scientific.\n\n1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:47.900\n Complicated ideas don't have to be scientific ideas.\n\n1:28:47.900 --> 1:28:50.100\n But I have, like I said, seen him in real time\n\n1:28:50.100 --> 1:28:54.060\n process complicated ideas with a speed that was stunning.\n\n1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:56.340\n In fact, he shocked the entire council.\n\n1:28:56.340 --> 1:29:01.260\n I mean, we were all stunned at his capacity\n\n1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:06.180\n to be presented with complicated ideas\n\n1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:08.580\n and then to wrestle with them and internalize them.\n\n1:29:08.580 --> 1:29:11.380\n And then come back, more interestingly enough,\n\n1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:14.020\n come back with really good questions to ask.\n\n1:29:14.020 --> 1:29:17.140\n I've noticed this in an area that I understand more\n\n1:29:17.140 --> 1:29:19.220\n of artificial intelligence.\n\n1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:21.740\n I've seen him integrate information\n\n1:29:21.740 --> 1:29:24.100\n about artificial intelligence and then come out\n\n1:29:24.100 --> 1:29:27.340\n with these kind of Richard Feynman like insights.\n\n1:29:27.340 --> 1:29:28.260\n That's exactly right.\n\n1:29:28.260 --> 1:29:32.380\n And as I said, those of us who have been in that position,\n\n1:29:32.380 --> 1:29:35.940\n it is stunning to see it happen because you don't expect it.\n\n1:29:35.940 --> 1:29:40.180\n Yeah, he takes what, for a lot of sort of graduate students,\n\n1:29:40.180 --> 1:29:42.220\n takes like four years in a particular topic\n\n1:29:42.220 --> 1:29:43.900\n and he just does it in a few minutes.\n\n1:29:43.900 --> 1:29:46.380\n He sees it very naturally.\n\n1:29:46.380 --> 1:29:47.780\n You've mentioned that you would love\n\n1:29:47.780 --> 1:29:51.820\n to see experimental validation of super strength theory\n\n1:29:51.820 --> 1:29:53.060\n before you shove.\n\n1:29:53.060 --> 1:29:56.260\n Before I shuffle off this mortal coil.\n\n1:29:56.260 --> 1:29:58.180\n Which the poetry of that reference\n\n1:29:58.180 --> 1:30:00.380\n made me smile when I saw it.\n\n1:30:00.380 --> 1:30:02.180\n You know, people actually misunderstand it\n\n1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:03.940\n because it's not what, it doesn't mean\n\n1:30:03.940 --> 1:30:06.620\n what we generally take it to mean colloquially.\n\n1:30:06.620 --> 1:30:08.300\n But it's such a beautiful expression.\n\n1:30:08.300 --> 1:30:09.140\n Yeah, it is.\n\n1:30:09.140 --> 1:30:13.780\n It's from the Hamlet, to be or not to be speech.\n\n1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:15.460\n Which I still don't understand what that's about.\n\n1:30:15.460 --> 1:30:18.620\n But so many interpretations.\n\n1:30:18.620 --> 1:30:22.700\n Anyway, what are the most exciting problems in physics\n\n1:30:22.700 --> 1:30:25.260\n that are just within our reach of understanding\n\n1:30:25.260 --> 1:30:27.340\n and maybe solve the next few decades\n\n1:30:27.340 --> 1:30:29.140\n that you may be able to see?\n\n1:30:29.140 --> 1:30:32.780\n So in physics, you limited it to physics.\n\n1:30:32.780 --> 1:30:36.380\n Physics, mathematics, this kind of space of problems\n\n1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:37.500\n that fascinate you.\n\n1:30:39.140 --> 1:30:41.660\n Well, the one that looks on the immediate horizon\n\n1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:43.980\n like we're gonna get to is quantum computing.\n\n1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:47.540\n And that's gonna, if we actually get there,\n\n1:30:47.540 --> 1:30:50.540\n that's gonna be extraordinarily interesting.\n\n1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:53.980\n Do you think that's a fundamentally problem of theory\n\n1:30:53.980 --> 1:30:55.860\n or is it now in the space of engineering?\n\n1:30:55.860 --> 1:30:57.020\n It's in the space of engineering.\n\n1:30:57.020 --> 1:31:01.340\n I was out at a Q station, as you may know,\n\n1:31:01.340 --> 1:31:06.340\n Microsoft has this research facility in Santa Barbara.\n\n1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:09.740\n I was out there a couple of months in my capacity\n\n1:31:09.740 --> 1:31:12.500\n as a vice president of American Physical Society.\n\n1:31:12.500 --> 1:31:15.660\n And I had some things that were like lectures\n\n1:31:15.660 --> 1:31:18.260\n and they were telling me what they were doing.\n\n1:31:18.260 --> 1:31:20.380\n And it sure sounded like they knew what they were doing\n\n1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:22.620\n and that they were close to major breakthroughs.\n\n1:31:24.140 --> 1:31:26.420\n Yeah, that's a really exciting possibility there.\n\n1:31:26.420 --> 1:31:31.420\n But back to Hamlet, do you ponder mortality,\n\n1:31:31.460 --> 1:31:32.660\n your own mortality?\n\n1:31:32.660 --> 1:31:35.940\n Nope, my mother died when I was 11 years old.\n\n1:31:35.940 --> 1:31:40.940\n And so I immediately knew what the end of the story was\n\n1:31:41.220 --> 1:31:42.580\n for all of us.\n\n1:31:42.580 --> 1:31:45.660\n As a consequence, I've never spent a lot of time\n\n1:31:45.660 --> 1:31:47.700\n thinking about death.\n\n1:31:47.700 --> 1:31:49.940\n It'll come in its own good time.\n\n1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:54.220\n And sort of to me, the job of every human\n\n1:31:54.220 --> 1:31:56.460\n is to make the best and the most of the time\n\n1:31:56.460 --> 1:32:01.460\n that's given to us in order not for our own selfish gain,\n\n1:32:02.340 --> 1:32:04.780\n but to try to make this place a better place\n\n1:32:04.780 --> 1:32:05.980\n for someone else.\n\n1:32:08.740 --> 1:32:13.460\n And on the why of life, why do you think we are?\n\n1:32:13.460 --> 1:32:16.380\n I have no idea and I never even worried about it.\n\n1:32:17.460 --> 1:32:20.900\n For me, I have an answer, a local answer.\n\n1:32:20.900 --> 1:32:22.460\n The apparent why for me was\n\n1:32:22.460 --> 1:32:25.020\n because I'm supposed to do physics.\n\n1:32:25.020 --> 1:32:28.140\n But it's funny because there's so many other\n\n1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:32.300\n quantum mechanically speaking possibilities in your life,\n\n1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:35.500\n such as being an astronaut, for example.\n\n1:32:35.500 --> 1:32:36.980\n So you know about that, I see.\n\n1:32:36.980 --> 1:32:41.980\n Well, like Einstein and the vicissitudes\n\n1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:50.740\n that prevented the 1914 measurement of starlight vending,\n\n1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:53.740\n the universe is constructed in such a way\n\n1:32:53.740 --> 1:32:56.020\n that I didn't become an astronaut, which would have,\n\n1:32:56.020 --> 1:33:00.020\n for me, I would have faced the worst choice in my life,\n\n1:33:00.020 --> 1:33:04.540\n whether I would try to become an astronaut\n\n1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:07.420\n or whether I would try to do theoretical physics.\n\n1:33:07.420 --> 1:33:09.140\n Both of these dreams were born\n\n1:33:09.140 --> 1:33:11.660\n when I was four years old simultaneously.\n\n1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:14.700\n And so I can't imagine how difficult\n\n1:33:14.700 --> 1:33:16.980\n that decision would have been.\n\n1:33:16.980 --> 1:33:19.540\n The universe helped you out on that one.\n\n1:33:19.540 --> 1:33:21.780\n Not only in that one, but in many ones.\n\n1:33:21.780 --> 1:33:25.380\n It helped me out by allowing me to pick the right dad.\n\n1:33:25.380 --> 1:33:27.900\n Is there a day in your life you could relive\n\n1:33:27.900 --> 1:33:29.740\n because it made you truly happy?\n\n1:33:29.740 --> 1:33:32.700\n What day would that be if you could just look back?\n\n1:33:32.700 --> 1:33:35.460\n Being a theoretical physicist\n\n1:33:35.460 --> 1:33:37.460\n is like having Christmas every day.\n\n1:33:39.020 --> 1:33:40.780\n I have lots of joy in my life.\n\n1:33:43.180 --> 1:33:46.940\n The moments of invention, the moments of ideas, revelation.\n\n1:33:46.940 --> 1:33:49.900\n Yes, the only thing that exceed them are\n\n1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:53.060\n some family experiences like when my kids were born\n\n1:33:53.060 --> 1:33:56.860\n and that kind of stuff, but they're pretty high up there.\n\n1:33:57.900 --> 1:34:00.540\n Well, I don't see a better way to end it, Jim.\n\n1:34:00.540 --> 1:34:01.380\n Thank you so much.\n\n1:34:01.380 --> 1:34:03.300\n It was a huge honor talking to you today.\n\n1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:05.340\n This worked out better than I thought.\n\n1:34:05.340 --> 1:34:35.100\n I'm glad to hear it.\n\n1:34:35.540 --> 1:34:38.300\n And now, let me leave you with some words of wisdom\n\n1:34:38.300 --> 1:34:42.780\n from the great Albert Einstein for the rebels among us.\n\n1:34:42.780 --> 1:34:45.020\n Unthinking respect for authority\n\n1:34:45.020 --> 1:34:48.140\n is the greatest enemy of truth.\n\n1:34:48.140 --> 1:35:07.140\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
