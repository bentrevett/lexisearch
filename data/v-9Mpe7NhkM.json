What is the song?\n\n01:36.960 --> 01:39.360\n All right, so it's pretty easy for me.\n\n01:39.360 --> 01:44.960\n There's this song called You're So Cool, Hans Zimmer, a soundtrack to True Romance.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.040\n It was a movie that made a big impression on me.\n\n01:49.040 --> 01:51.840\n And it's kind of been following me through my life.\n\n01:51.840 --> 01:54.880\n I actually had it play at my wedding.\n\n01:55.360 --> 01:58.400\n I sat with the organist and helped him play it on an organ,\n\n01:58.400 --> 02:01.040\n which was a pretty interesting experience.\n\n02:01.040 --> 02:06.000\n That is probably my, I would say, top three movie of all time.\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:07.600\n Yeah, this is an incredible movie.\n\n02:07.600 --> 02:10.400\n Yeah, and it came out during my formative years.\n\n02:10.400 --> 02:15.920\n And as I've discovered in music, you shape your music taste during those years.\n\n02:15.920 --> 02:17.840\n So it definitely affected me quite a bit.\n\n02:17.840 --> 02:20.400\n Did it affect you in any other kind of way?\n\n02:20.960 --> 02:23.440\n Well, the movie itself affected me back then.\n\n02:23.440 --> 02:24.880\n It was a big part of culture.\n\n02:25.600 --> 02:27.680\n I didn't really adopt any characters from the movie,\n\n02:27.680 --> 02:32.160\n but it was a great story of love, fantastic actors.\n\n02:33.040 --> 02:37.920\n And really, I didn't even know who Hans Zimmer was at the time, but fantastic music.\n\n02:39.040 --> 02:42.160\n And so that song has followed me.\n\n02:42.160 --> 02:43.920\n And the movie actually has followed me throughout my life.\n\n02:43.920 --> 02:48.480\n That was Quentin Tarantino, actually, I think, director or producer.\n\n02:48.480 --> 02:52.080\n So it's not Stairway to Heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\n02:52.080 --> 02:53.600\n Those are great.\n\n02:53.600 --> 02:57.760\n They're not my personal favorites, but I've realized that people have different tastes.\n\n02:57.760 --> 03:00.400\n And that's a big part of what we do.\n\n03:00.400 --> 03:02.640\n Well, for me, I would have to stick with Stairway to Heaven.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.280\n So 35,000 years ago, I looked this up on Wikipedia,\n\n03:09.280 --> 03:13.120\n flute like instruments started being used in caves as part of hunting rituals.\n\n03:13.120 --> 03:15.760\n And primitive cultural gatherings, things like that.\n\n03:15.760 --> 03:17.280\n This is the birth of music.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:25.040\n Since then, we had a few folks, Beethoven, Elvis, Beatles, Justin Bieber, of course, Drake.\n\n03:25.680 --> 03:29.280\n So in your view, let's start like high level philosophical.\n\n03:29.280 --> 03:34.080\n What is the purpose of music on this planet of ours?\n\n03:35.200 --> 03:38.240\n I think music has many different purposes.\n\n03:38.240 --> 03:44.640\n I think there's certainly a big purpose, which is the same as much of entertainment,\n\n03:44.640 --> 03:52.080\n which is escapism and to be able to live in some sort of other mental state for a while.\n\n03:52.080 --> 03:54.320\n But I also think you have the opposite of escaping,\n\n03:54.320 --> 03:56.720\n which is to help you focus on something you are actually doing.\n\n03:57.280 --> 04:02.080\n Because I think people use music as a tool to tune the brain\n\n04:02.640 --> 04:05.120\n to the activities that they are actually doing.\n\n04:05.120 --> 04:10.560\n And it's kind of like, in one sense, maybe it's the rawest signal.\n\n04:10.560 --> 04:13.040\n If you think about the brain as neural networks,\n\n04:13.040 --> 04:16.880\n it's maybe the most efficient hack we can do to actually actively tune it\n\n04:16.880 --> 04:18.400\n into some state that you want to be.\n\n04:18.880 --> 04:19.760\n You can do it in other ways.\n\n04:19.760 --> 04:22.240\n You can tell stories to put people in a certain mood.\n\n04:22.240 --> 04:26.240\n But music is probably very effective to get you to a certain mood very fast, I think.\n\n04:27.120 --> 04:30.960\n You know, there's a social component historically to music,\n\n04:30.960 --> 04:32.480\n where people listen to music together.\n\n04:32.480 --> 04:36.880\n I was just thinking about this, that to me, and you mentioned machine learning,\n\n04:36.880 --> 04:42.000\n but to me personally, music is a really private thing.\n\n04:43.040 --> 04:45.920\n I'm speaking for myself, I listen to music,\n\n04:45.920 --> 04:49.600\n like almost nobody knows the kind of things I have in my library,\n\n04:50.320 --> 04:54.400\n except people who are really close to me and they really only know a certain percentage.\n\n04:54.400 --> 04:58.560\n There's like some weird stuff that I'm almost probably embarrassed by, right?\n\n04:58.560 --> 05:00.000\n It's called the guilty pleasures, right?\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.560\n Everyone has the guilty pleasures, yeah.\n\n05:02.560 --> 05:06.560\n Hopefully they're not too bad, but for me, it's personal.\n\n05:06.560 --> 05:12.880\n Do you think of music as something that's social or as something that's personal?\n\n05:12.880 --> 05:13.600\n Or does it vary?\n\n05:14.560 --> 05:20.720\n So I think it's the same answer that you use it for both.\n\n05:20.720 --> 05:24.800\n We've thought a lot about this during these 10 years at Spotify, obviously.\n\n05:25.360 --> 05:27.840\n In one sense, as you said, music is incredibly\n\n05:27.840 --> 05:29.760\n social, you go to concerts and so forth.\n\n05:30.480 --> 05:38.400\n On the other hand, it is your escape and everyone has these things that are very personal to them.\n\n05:38.400 --> 05:47.680\n So what we've found is that when it comes to, most people claim that they have a friend or two\n\n05:47.680 --> 05:50.880\n that they are heavily inspired by and that they listen to.\n\n05:50.880 --> 05:54.560\n So I actually think music is very social, but in a smaller group setting,\n\n05:54.560 --> 06:00.400\n it's an intimate form of, it's an intimate relationship.\n\n06:00.400 --> 06:03.360\n It's not something that you necessarily share broadly.\n\n06:03.360 --> 06:07.040\n Now, at concerts, you can argue you do, but then you've gathered a lot of people\n\n06:07.040 --> 06:08.880\n that you have something in common with.\n\n06:08.880 --> 06:16.960\n I think this broadcast sharing of music is something we tried on social networks and so forth.\n\n06:16.960 --> 06:23.120\n But it turns out that people aren't super interested in sharing their music.\n\n06:23.120 --> 06:26.960\n They aren't super interested in what their friends listen to.\n\n06:28.480 --> 06:32.800\n They're interested in understanding if they have something in common perhaps with a friend,\n\n06:32.800 --> 06:35.040\n but not just as information.\n\n06:35.680 --> 06:37.280\n Right, that's really interesting.\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:40.880\n I was just thinking of it this morning, listening to Spotify.\n\n06:41.600 --> 06:48.480\n I really have a pretty intimate relationship with Spotify, with my playlists, right?\n\n06:48.480 --> 06:53.360\n I've had them for many years now and they've grown with me together.\n\n06:53.360 --> 06:59.520\n There's an intimate relationship you have with a library of music that you've developed.\n\n06:59.520 --> 07:01.920\n And we'll talk about different ways we can play with that.\n\n07:02.480 --> 07:08.240\n Can you do the impossible task and try to give a history of music listening\n\n07:09.280 --> 07:14.160\n from your perspective from before the internet and after the internet\n\n07:14.160 --> 07:18.800\n and just kind of everything leading up to streaming with Spotify and so on?\n\n07:18.800 --> 07:19.280\n I'll try.\n\n07:19.280 --> 07:20.880\n It could be a 100 year podcast.\n\n07:22.320 --> 07:24.400\n I'll try to do a brief version.\n\n07:24.400 --> 07:28.080\n There are some things that I think are very interesting during the history of music,\n\n07:28.080 --> 07:33.040\n which is that before recorded music, to be able to enjoy music,\n\n07:33.040 --> 07:35.440\n you actually had to be where the music was produced\n\n07:35.440 --> 07:38.640\n because you couldn't record it and time shift it, right?\n\n07:38.640 --> 07:41.520\n Creation and consumption had to happen at the same time, basically concerts.\n\n07:41.520 --> 07:46.320\n And so you either had to get to the nearest village to listen to music.\n\n07:46.320 --> 07:50.880\n And while that was cumbersome and it severely limited the distribution of music,\n\n07:51.440 --> 07:53.200\n it also had some different qualities,\n\n07:53.200 --> 07:56.640\n which was that the creator could always interact with the audience.\n\n07:56.640 --> 07:57.600\n It was always live.\n\n07:58.400 --> 08:00.640\n And also there was no time cap on the music.\n\n08:00.640 --> 08:04.960\n So I think it's not a coincidence that these early classical works,\n\n08:04.960 --> 08:06.640\n they're much longer than the three minutes.\n\n08:06.640 --> 08:11.600\n The three minutes came in as a restriction of the first wax disc that could only contain\n\n08:11.600 --> 08:14.080\n a three minute song on one side, right?\n\n08:14.080 --> 08:20.400\n So actually the recorded music severely limited or put constraints.\n\n08:20.400 --> 08:21.040\n I won't say limit.\n\n08:21.040 --> 08:22.160\n I mean, constraints are often good,\n\n08:22.160 --> 08:24.960\n but it put very hard constraints on the music format.\n\n08:24.960 --> 08:30.400\n So you kind of said, instead of doing this opus on many tens of minutes or something,\n\n08:31.200 --> 08:34.560\n now you get three and a half minutes because then you're out of wax on this disc.\n\n08:34.560 --> 08:37.680\n But in return, you get an amazing distribution.\n\n08:37.680 --> 08:39.440\n Your reach will widen, right?\n\n08:39.440 --> 08:40.880\n Just on that point real quick.\n\n08:42.560 --> 08:47.360\n Without the mass scale distribution, there's a scarcity component\n\n08:47.920 --> 08:50.720\n where you kind of look forward to it.\n\n08:51.760 --> 08:56.400\n We had that, it's like the Netflix versus HBO Game of Thrones.\n\n08:56.400 --> 09:00.160\n You like wait for the event because you can't really listen to it.\n\n09:00.160 --> 09:02.800\n So you like look forward to it and then it's like,\n\n09:02.800 --> 09:07.920\n you derive perhaps more pleasure because it's more rare for you to listen to a particular piece.\n\n09:07.920 --> 09:09.920\n You think there's value to that scarcity?\n\n09:10.480 --> 09:12.720\n Yeah, I think that that is definitely a thing.\n\n09:12.720 --> 09:17.200\n And there's always this component of if you have something in infinite amounts,\n\n09:17.200 --> 09:19.120\n will you value it as much?\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:20.880\n Probably not.\n\n09:20.880 --> 09:24.400\n Humanity is always seeking some, it's relative.\n\n09:24.400 --> 09:25.840\n So you're always seeking something you didn't have.\n\n09:25.840 --> 09:27.600\n And when you have it, you don't appreciate it as much.\n\n09:27.600 --> 09:29.520\n So I think that's probably true.\n\n09:29.520 --> 09:31.200\n But I think that that's probably true.\n\n09:31.200 --> 09:33.040\n But I think that's why concerts exist.\n\n09:33.040 --> 09:34.560\n So you can actually have both.\n\n09:35.520 --> 09:42.000\n But I think net, if you couldn't listen to music in your car driving, that'd be worse.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.240\n That cost will be bigger than the benefit of the anticipation I think that you would have.\n\n09:47.360 --> 09:50.720\n So, yeah, it started with live concerts.\n\n09:50.720 --> 09:56.720\n Then it's being able to, you know, the phonograph invented, right?\n\n09:56.720 --> 09:59.440\n That you start to be able to record music.\n\n09:59.440 --> 09:59.840\n Exactly.\n\n09:59.840 --> 10:04.560\n So then you got this massive distribution that made it possible to create two things.\n\n10:04.560 --> 10:09.760\n I think, first of all, cultural phenomenons, they probably need distribution to be able to happen.\n\n10:10.560 --> 10:15.520\n But it also opened access to, you know, for a new kind of artist.\n\n10:15.520 --> 10:18.720\n So you started to have these phenomenons like Beatles and Elvis and so forth.\n\n10:18.720 --> 10:23.680\n That would really, a function of distribution, I think, obviously of talent and innovation.\n\n10:23.680 --> 10:25.200\n But there was also technical component.\n\n10:25.760 --> 10:29.040\n And of course, the next big innovation to come along was radio.\n\n10:29.040 --> 10:29.680\n Broadcast radio.\n\n10:30.720 --> 10:36.240\n And I think radio is interesting because it started not as a music medium.\n\n10:36.240 --> 10:39.600\n It started as an information medium for news.\n\n10:39.600 --> 10:45.280\n And then radio needed to find something to fill the time with so that they could honestly\n\n10:45.280 --> 10:46.720\n play more ads and make more money.\n\n10:47.200 --> 10:48.480\n And music was free.\n\n10:48.480 --> 10:52.480\n So then you had this massive distribution where you could program to people.\n\n10:52.480 --> 10:59.200\n I think those things, that ecosystem, is what created the ability for hits.\n\n10:59.200 --> 11:01.600\n But it was also a very broadcast medium.\n\n11:01.600 --> 11:06.000\n So you would tend to get these massive, massive hits, but maybe not such a long tail.\n\n11:07.440 --> 11:10.480\n In terms of choice of everybody listens to the same stuff.\n\n11:10.480 --> 11:10.960\n Yeah.\n\n11:10.960 --> 11:13.840\n And as you said, I think there are some social benefits to that.\n\n11:14.720 --> 11:19.760\n I think, for example, there's a high statistical chance that if I talk about the latest episode\n\n11:19.760 --> 11:22.640\n of Game of Thrones, we have something to talk about, just statistically.\n\n11:23.280 --> 11:26.240\n In the age of individual choice, maybe some of that goes away.\n\n11:26.240 --> 11:35.120\n So I do see the value of shared cultural components, but I also obviously love personalization.\n\n11:36.400 --> 11:39.120\n And so let's catch this up to the internet.\n\n11:39.120 --> 11:44.640\n So maybe Napster, well, first of all, there's MP3s, tapes, CDs.\n\n11:44.640 --> 11:47.440\n There was a digitalization of music with a CD, really.\n\n11:47.440 --> 11:50.320\n It was physical distribution, but the music became digital.\n\n11:51.200 --> 11:55.840\n And so they were files, but basically boxed software, to use a software analogy.\n\n11:56.800 --> 11:58.800\n And then you could start downloading these files.\n\n11:59.920 --> 12:02.480\n And I think there are two interesting things that happened.\n\n12:02.480 --> 12:07.120\n Back to music used to be longer before it was constrained by the distribution medium.\n\n12:08.080 --> 12:09.840\n I don't think that was a coincidence.\n\n12:09.840 --> 12:15.600\n And then really the only music genre to have developed mostly after music was a file again\n\n12:15.600 --> 12:17.360\n on the internet is EDM.\n\n12:17.360 --> 12:20.640\n And EDM is often much longer than the traditional music.\n\n12:20.640 --> 12:25.200\n I think it's interesting to think about the fact that music is no longer constrained in\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.040\n minutes per song or something.\n\n12:27.040 --> 12:31.120\n It's a legacy of an old distribution technology.\n\n12:31.120 --> 12:33.680\n And you see some of this new music that breaks the format.\n\n12:33.680 --> 12:38.160\n Not so much as I would have expected actually by now, but it still happens.\n\n12:38.160 --> 12:41.120\n So first of all, I don't really know what EDM is.\n\n12:41.120 --> 12:42.320\n Electronic dance music.\n\n12:42.320 --> 12:42.880\n Yeah.\n\n12:42.880 --> 12:44.160\n You could say Avicii.\n\n12:44.160 --> 12:46.800\n Avicii was one of the biggest in this genre.\n\n12:46.800 --> 12:49.680\n So the main constraint is of time.\n\n12:49.680 --> 12:52.480\n Something like a three, four, five minute song.\n\n12:52.480 --> 12:55.760\n So you could have songs that were eight minutes, 10 minutes and so forth.\n\n12:56.320 --> 13:01.040\n Because it started as a digital product that you downloaded.\n\n13:01.040 --> 13:02.880\n So you didn't have this constraint anymore.\n\n13:03.920 --> 13:07.440\n So I think it's something really interesting that I don't think has fully happened yet.\n\n13:08.480 --> 13:12.880\n We're kind of jumping ahead a little bit to where we are, but I think there's tons of format\n\n13:12.880 --> 13:18.880\n innovation in music that should happen now, that couldn't happen when you needed to really\n\n13:18.880 --> 13:20.880\n adhere to the distribution constraints.\n\n13:20.880 --> 13:24.240\n If you didn't adhere to that, you would get no distribution.\n\n13:24.240 --> 13:30.720\n So Bj\u00f6rk, for example, the Icelandic artist, she made a full iPad app as an album.\n\n13:30.720 --> 13:31.920\n That was very expensive.\n\n13:33.440 --> 13:38.000\n Even though the app store has great distribution, she gets nowhere near the distribution versus\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.760\n staying within the three minute format.\n\n13:39.760 --> 13:44.720\n So I think now that music is fully digital inside these streaming services, there is\n\n13:44.720 --> 13:50.080\n the opportunity to change the format again and allow creators to be much more creative\n\n13:50.080 --> 13:52.800\n without limiting their distribution ability.\n\n13:52.800 --> 13:54.960\n That's interesting that you're right.\n\n13:54.960 --> 13:59.280\n It's surprising that we don't see that taken advantage more often.\n\n13:59.280 --> 14:06.400\n It's almost like the constraints of the distribution from the 50s and 60s have molded the culture\n\n14:06.400 --> 14:12.480\n to where we want the five, three to five minute song than anything else, not just.\n\n14:12.480 --> 14:18.880\n So we want the song as consumers and as artists, because I write a lot of music and I never\n\n14:18.880 --> 14:23.600\n even thought about writing something longer than 10 minutes.\n\n14:23.600 --> 14:26.640\n It's really interesting that those constraints.\n\n14:26.640 --> 14:29.600\n Because all your training data has been three and a half minute songs, right?\n\n14:29.600 --> 14:30.320\n It's right.\n\n14:30.320 --> 14:36.480\n Okay, so yes, digitization of data led to then mp3s.\n\n14:36.480 --> 14:42.240\n Yeah, so I think you had this file then that was distributed physically, but then you had\n\n14:42.240 --> 14:46.800\n the components of digital distribution and then the internet happened and there was this\n\n14:46.800 --> 14:51.120\n vacuum where you had a format that could be digitally shipped, but there was no business\n\n14:51.120 --> 14:51.840\n model.\n\n14:51.840 --> 14:58.880\n And then all these pirate networks happened, Napster and in Pirate Island.\n\n14:58.880 --> 15:02.960\n Napster and in Sweden Pirate Bay, which was one of the biggest.\n\n15:02.960 --> 15:10.080\n And I think from a consumer point of view, which kind of leads up to the inception of\n\n15:10.080 --> 15:15.840\n Spotify, from a consumer point of view, consumers for the first time had this access model to\n\n15:15.840 --> 15:25.680\n music where they could, without kind of any marginal cost, they could try different tracks.\n\n15:25.680 --> 15:27.360\n You could use music in new ways.\n\n15:27.360 --> 15:28.880\n There was no marginal cost.\n\n15:28.880 --> 15:32.480\n And that was a fantastic consumer experience to have access to all the music ever made,\n\n15:32.480 --> 15:33.920\n I think was fantastic.\n\n15:34.560 --> 15:38.000\n But it was also horrible for artists because there was no business model around it.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.600\n So they didn't make any money.\n\n15:39.600 --> 15:46.400\n So the user need almost drove the user interface before there was a business model.\n\n15:46.400 --> 15:52.160\n And then there were these download stores that allowed you to download files, which\n\n15:52.160 --> 15:55.040\n was a solution, but it didn't solve the access problem.\n\n15:55.040 --> 15:58.560\n There was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to try one more track.\n\n15:58.560 --> 16:01.920\n And I think that that heavily limits how you listen to music.\n\n16:01.920 --> 16:07.600\n The example I always give is, you know, in Spotify, a huge amount of people listen to\n\n16:07.600 --> 16:10.320\n music while they sleep, while they go to sleep and while they sleep.\n\n16:11.280 --> 16:14.960\n If that costed you 99 cents per three minutes, you probably wouldn't do that.\n\n16:15.520 --> 16:18.640\n And you would be much less adventurous if there was a real dollar cost to exploring\n\n16:18.640 --> 16:19.200\n music.\n\n16:19.200 --> 16:22.320\n So the access model is interesting in that it changes your music behavior.\n\n16:22.320 --> 16:26.560\n You can be, you can take much more risk because there's no marginal cost to it.\n\n16:27.680 --> 16:32.320\n Maybe let me linger on piracy for a second, because I find, especially coming from Russia,\n\n16:33.200 --> 16:36.560\n piracy is something that's very interesting to me.\n\n16:39.440 --> 16:49.040\n Not me, of course, ever, but I have friends who have partook in piracy of music, software,\n\n16:49.040 --> 16:51.600\n TV shows, sporting events.\n\n16:52.400 --> 16:57.920\n And usually to me, what that shows is not that they're, they can actually pay the money\n\n16:58.400 --> 16:59.600\n and they're not trying to save money.\n\n17:00.480 --> 17:02.800\n They're choosing the best experience.\n\n17:03.760 --> 17:08.560\n So what to me, piracy shows is a business opportunity in all these domains.\n\n17:08.560 --> 17:11.120\n And that's where I think you're right.\n\n17:11.120 --> 17:15.840\n Spotify stepped in is basically piracy was an experience.\n\n17:15.840 --> 17:23.520\n You can explore with fine music you like, and actually the interface of piracy is horrible\n\n17:23.520 --> 17:29.680\n because it's, I mean, it's bad metadata, long download times, all kinds of stuff.\n\n17:29.680 --> 17:37.520\n And what Spotify does is basically first rewards artists and second makes the experience of\n\n17:37.520 --> 17:38.720\n exploring music much better.\n\n17:38.720 --> 17:42.560\n I mean, the same is true, I think for movies and so on.\n\n17:42.560 --> 17:48.080\n That piracy reveals in the software space, for example, I'm a huge user and fan of Adobe\n\n17:48.080 --> 17:54.720\n products and there was much more incentive to pirate Adobe products before they went\n\n17:54.720 --> 17:56.400\n to a monthly subscription plan.\n\n17:57.120 --> 18:04.640\n And now all of the said friends that used to pirate Adobe products that I know now actually\n\n18:04.640 --> 18:06.880\n pay gladly for the monthly subscription.\n\n18:06.880 --> 18:08.000\n Yeah, I think you're right.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.360\n I think it's a sign of an opportunity for product development.\n\n18:11.360 --> 18:19.120\n And that sometimes there's a product market fit before there's a business model fit in\n\n18:19.120 --> 18:19.840\n product development.\n\n18:19.840 --> 18:21.760\n I think that's a sign of it.\n\n18:21.760 --> 18:24.320\n In Sweden, I think it was a bit of both.\n\n18:24.320 --> 18:30.480\n There was a culture where we even had a political party called the Pirate Party.\n\n18:30.480 --> 18:35.120\n And this was during the time when people said that information should be free.\n\n18:35.120 --> 18:38.080\n It was somehow wrong to charge for ones and zeros.\n\n18:38.080 --> 18:43.600\n So I think people felt that artists should probably make some money somehow else and\n\n18:43.600 --> 18:44.880\n concerts or something.\n\n18:44.880 --> 18:49.920\n So at least in Sweden, it was part really social acceptance, even at the political level.\n\n18:49.920 --> 18:56.800\n But that also forced Spotify to compete with free, which I don't think would actually\n\n18:56.800 --> 18:58.560\n could have happened anywhere else in the world.\n\n18:58.560 --> 19:03.120\n The music industry needed to be doing bad enough to take that risk.\n\n19:03.120 --> 19:04.800\n And Sweden was like the perfect testing ground.\n\n19:04.800 --> 19:10.640\n It had government funded high bandwidth, low latency broadband, which meant that the product\n\n19:10.640 --> 19:11.440\n would work.\n\n19:11.440 --> 19:14.000\n And it was also there was no music revenue anyway.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.600\n So they were kind of like, I don't think this is going to work, but why not?\n\n19:18.800 --> 19:21.920\n So this product is one that I don't think could have happened in America, the world's\n\n19:21.920 --> 19:23.200\n largest music market, for example.\n\n19:23.920 --> 19:25.600\n So how do you compete with free?\n\n19:25.600 --> 19:30.640\n Because that's an interesting world of the internet where most people don't like to\n\n19:30.640 --> 19:31.520\n pay for things.\n\n19:31.520 --> 19:35.360\n So Spotify steps in and tries to, yes, compete with free.\n\n19:36.080 --> 19:36.640\n How do you do it?\n\n19:37.120 --> 19:38.240\n So I think two things.\n\n19:38.240 --> 19:41.680\n One is people are starting to pay for things on the internet.\n\n19:41.680 --> 19:47.440\n I think one way to think about it was that advertising was the first business model because\n\n19:47.440 --> 19:49.200\n no one would put a credit card on the internet.\n\n19:49.200 --> 19:51.040\n Transactional with Amazon was the second.\n\n19:51.600 --> 19:52.960\n And maybe subscription is the third.\n\n19:52.960 --> 19:55.680\n And if you look offline, subscription is the biggest of those.\n\n19:56.480 --> 19:57.600\n So that may still happen.\n\n19:57.600 --> 19:59.040\n I think people are starting to pay for things.\n\n19:59.040 --> 20:01.680\n But definitely back then, we needed to compete with free.\n\n20:02.480 --> 20:07.600\n And the first thing you need to do is obviously to lower the price to free and then you need\n\n20:07.600 --> 20:09.440\n to be better somehow.\n\n20:09.440 --> 20:15.040\n And the way that Spotify was better was on the user experience, on the actual performance,\n\n20:15.040 --> 20:24.640\n the latency of, you know, even if you had high bandwidth broadband, it would still take\n\n20:24.640 --> 20:30.800\n you 30 seconds to a minute to download one of these tracks.\n\n20:30.800 --> 20:35.360\n So the Spotify experience of starting within the perceptual limit of immediacy, about 250\n\n20:35.360 --> 20:41.520\n milliseconds, meant that the whole trick was it felt as if you had downloaded all of Pirate\n\n20:41.520 --> 20:41.680\n Bay.\n\n20:41.680 --> 20:42.800\n It was on your hard drive.\n\n20:42.800 --> 20:44.400\n It was that fast, even though it wasn't.\n\n20:45.360 --> 20:46.720\n And it was still free.\n\n20:46.720 --> 20:50.400\n But somehow you were actually still being a legal citizen.\n\n20:50.400 --> 20:54.160\n And that was the trick that Spotify managed to pull off.\n\n20:54.880 --> 20:58.240\n So I've actually heard you say this or write this.\n\n20:58.240 --> 21:02.400\n And I was surprised that I wasn't aware of it because I just took it for granted.\n\n21:02.400 --> 21:05.920\n You know, whenever an awesome thing comes along, you're just like, of course, it has\n\n21:05.920 --> 21:06.480\n to be this way.\n\n21:07.360 --> 21:08.560\n That's exactly right.\n\n21:08.560 --> 21:14.720\n That it felt like the entire world's libraries at my fingertips because of that latency being\n\n21:14.720 --> 21:15.440\n reduced.\n\n21:15.440 --> 21:18.640\n What was the technical challenge in reducing the latency?\n\n21:18.640 --> 21:25.280\n So there was a group of really, really talented engineers, one of them called Ludwig Strigius.\n\n21:25.280 --> 21:32.080\n He wrote the, actually from Gothenburg, he wrote the initial, the uTorrent client, which\n\n21:32.080 --> 21:37.760\n is kind of an interesting backstory to Spotify, that we have one of the top developers from\n\n21:38.480 --> 21:39.840\n uTorrent clients as well.\n\n21:39.840 --> 21:42.320\n So he wrote uTorrent, the world's smallest uTorrent client.\n\n21:42.320 --> 21:49.440\n And then he was acquired very early by Daniel and Martin, who founded Spotify, and they\n\n21:49.440 --> 21:53.040\n actually sold the uTorrent client to BitTorrent, but kept Ludwig.\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:58.240\n So Spotify had a lot of experience within peer to peer networking.\n\n21:59.040 --> 22:04.560\n So the original innovation was a distribution innovation, where Spotify built an end to\n\n22:04.560 --> 22:08.160\n end media distribution system up until only a few years ago, we actually hosted all the\n\n22:08.160 --> 22:09.440\n music ourselves.\n\n22:09.440 --> 22:13.360\n So we had both the service side and the client, and that meant that we could do things such\n\n22:13.360 --> 22:19.200\n as having a peer to peer solution to use local caching on the client side, because back then\n\n22:19.200 --> 22:20.800\n the world was mostly desktop.\n\n22:20.800 --> 22:26.240\n But we could also do things like hack the TCP protocols, things like Nagel's algorithm\n\n22:26.240 --> 22:31.200\n for kind of exponential back off, or ramp up and just go full throttle and optimize\n\n22:31.200 --> 22:33.760\n for latency at the cost of bandwidth.\n\n22:33.760 --> 22:39.200\n And all of this end to end control meant that we could do an experience that felt like a\n\n22:39.200 --> 22:40.480\n step change.\n\n22:40.480 --> 22:46.720\n These days, we actually are on GCP, we don't host our own stuff, and everyone is really\n\n22:46.720 --> 22:47.360\n fast these days.\n\n22:47.360 --> 22:49.440\n So that was the initial competitive advantage.\n\n22:49.440 --> 22:51.440\n But then obviously, you have to move on over time.\n\n22:51.440 --> 22:54.480\n And that was over 10 years ago, right?\n\n22:54.480 --> 22:55.840\n That was in 2008.\n\n22:55.840 --> 22:57.520\n The product was launched in Sweden.\n\n22:57.520 --> 22:59.440\n It was in a beta, I think, 2007.\n\n22:59.440 --> 23:00.800\n And it was on the desktop, right?\n\n23:00.800 --> 23:01.840\n It was desktop only.\n\n23:01.840 --> 23:03.840\n There's no phone.\n\n23:03.840 --> 23:04.480\n There was no phone.\n\n23:04.480 --> 23:07.920\n The iPhone came out in 2008.\n\n23:07.920 --> 23:10.480\n But the App Store came out one year later, I think.\n\n23:10.480 --> 23:13.120\n So the writing was on the wall, but there was no phone yet.\n\n23:14.160 --> 23:19.680\n You've mentioned that people would use Spotify to discover the songs they like, and then\n\n23:19.680 --> 23:24.880\n they would torrent those songs to so they can copy it to their phone.\n\n23:24.880 --> 23:25.840\n Just hilarious.\n\n23:25.840 --> 23:26.320\n Exactly.\n\n23:26.320 --> 23:27.440\n Not torrent, pirate.\n\n23:27.440 --> 23:32.800\n Seriously, piracy does seem to be like a good guide for business models.\n\n23:33.520 --> 23:34.560\n Video content.\n\n23:34.560 --> 23:37.600\n As far as I know, Spotify doesn't have video content.\n\n23:37.600 --> 23:42.080\n Well, we do have music videos, and we do have videos on the service.\n\n23:42.080 --> 23:48.320\n But the way we think about ourselves is that we're an audio service, and we think that\n\n23:48.320 --> 23:52.800\n if you look at the amount of time that people spend on audio, it's actually very similar\n\n23:52.800 --> 23:55.200\n to the amount of time that people spend on music.\n\n23:55.200 --> 23:58.640\n It's very similar to the amount of time that people spend on video.\n\n23:58.640 --> 24:02.000\n So the opportunity should be equally big.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.520\n But today, it's not at all valued.\n\n24:03.520 --> 24:05.040\n Videos value much higher.\n\n24:05.040 --> 24:08.320\n So we think it's basically completely undervalued.\n\n24:08.320 --> 24:10.560\n So we think of ourselves as an audio service.\n\n24:10.560 --> 24:14.000\n But within that audio service, I think video can make a lot of sense.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:19.040\n I think when you're discovering an artist, you probably do want to see them and understand\n\n24:19.040 --> 24:21.200\n who they are, to understand their identity.\n\n24:21.200 --> 24:22.400\n You won't see that video every time.\n\n24:22.400 --> 24:25.120\n 90% of the time, the phone is going to be in your pocket.\n\n24:25.120 --> 24:27.280\n For podcasters, you use video.\n\n24:27.280 --> 24:28.560\n I think that can make a ton of sense.\n\n24:28.560 --> 24:33.600\n So we do have video, but we're an audio service where, think of it as we call it internally,\n\n24:33.600 --> 24:35.120\n backgroundable video.\n\n24:35.120 --> 24:38.720\n Video that is helpful, but isn't the driver of the narrative.\n\n24:39.440 --> 24:48.560\n I think also, if we look at YouTube, there's quite a few folks who listen to music on YouTube.\n\n24:48.560 --> 24:55.280\n So in some sense, YouTube is a bit of a competitor to Spotify, which is very strange to me that\n\n24:55.280 --> 24:57.360\n people use YouTube to listen to music.\n\n24:57.920 --> 25:00.640\n They play essentially the music videos, right?\n\n25:00.640 --> 25:03.360\n But don't watch the videos and put it in their pocket.\n\n25:03.360 --> 25:12.240\n Well, I think it's similar to what, strangely, maybe it's similar to what we were for the\n\n25:12.240 --> 25:20.640\n piracy networks, where YouTube, for historical reasons, have a lot of music videos.\n\n25:20.640 --> 25:25.040\n So people use YouTube for a lot of the discovery part of the process, I think.\n\n25:25.040 --> 25:29.520\n But then it's not a really good sort of, quote unquote, MP3 player, because it doesn't even\n\n25:29.520 --> 25:29.920\n background.\n\n25:29.920 --> 25:31.600\n Then you have to keep the app in the foreground.\n\n25:31.600 --> 25:36.160\n So it's not a good consumption tool, but it's a decently good discovery.\n\n25:36.160 --> 25:37.840\n I mean, I think YouTube is a fantastic product.\n\n25:38.400 --> 25:40.320\n And I use it for all kinds of purposes.\n\n25:40.320 --> 25:41.040\n That's true.\n\n25:41.040 --> 25:46.560\n If I were to admit something, I do use YouTube a little bit to assist in the discovery process\n\n25:46.560 --> 25:47.280\n of songs.\n\n25:47.280 --> 25:50.320\n And then if I like it, I'll add it to Spotify.\n\n25:50.320 --> 25:51.760\n But that's OK.\n\n25:51.760 --> 25:52.560\n That's OK with us.\n\n25:53.600 --> 25:55.520\n OK, so sorry, we're jumping around a little bit.\n\n25:55.520 --> 25:57.920\n So it's kind of incredible.\n\n25:58.560 --> 26:01.440\n You look at Napster, you look at the early days of Spotify.\n\n26:03.440 --> 26:06.080\n One fascinating point is how do you grow a user base?\n\n26:06.640 --> 26:08.320\n So you're there in Sweden.\n\n26:08.960 --> 26:10.320\n You have an idea.\n\n26:10.320 --> 26:12.480\n I saw the initial sketches that look terrible.\n\n26:14.160 --> 26:18.240\n How do you grow a user base from a few folks to millions?\n\n26:19.280 --> 26:21.680\n I think there are a bunch of tactical answers.\n\n26:22.240 --> 26:24.160\n So first of all, I think you need a great product.\n\n26:24.160 --> 26:30.080\n I don't think you take a bad product and market it to be successful.\n\n26:30.080 --> 26:31.120\n So you need a great product.\n\n26:31.120 --> 26:34.720\n But sorry to interrupt, but it's a totally new way to listen to music, too.\n\n26:34.720 --> 26:38.560\n So it's not just did people realize immediately that Spotify is a great product?\n\n26:38.560 --> 26:40.240\n No, I think they did.\n\n26:40.240 --> 26:45.280\n So back to the point of piracy, it was a totally new way to listen to music legally.\n\n26:45.840 --> 26:48.960\n But people had been used to the access model in Sweden\n\n26:48.960 --> 26:50.880\n and the rest of the world for a long time through piracy.\n\n26:50.880 --> 26:54.160\n So one way to think about Spotify, it was just legal and fast piracy.\n\n26:54.720 --> 26:56.240\n And so people have been using it for a long time.\n\n26:56.960 --> 26:59.040\n So they weren't alien to it.\n\n26:59.040 --> 27:01.360\n They didn't really understand how it could be illegal\n\n27:01.360 --> 27:03.920\n because it seemed too fast and too good to be true,\n\n27:03.920 --> 27:06.960\n which I think is a great product proposition if you can be too good to be true.\n\n27:06.960 --> 27:09.760\n But what I saw again and again was people showing each other,\n\n27:09.760 --> 27:13.200\n clicking the song, showing how fast it started and say, can you believe this?\n\n27:13.200 --> 27:16.320\n So I really think it was about speed.\n\n27:16.320 --> 27:22.000\n Then we also had an invite program that was really meant for scaling\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.280\n because we hosted our own service.\n\n27:23.280 --> 27:25.040\n We needed to control scaling.\n\n27:25.040 --> 27:27.600\n But that built a lot of expectation.\n\n27:27.600 --> 27:32.880\n And I don't want to say hype because hype implies that it wasn't true.\n\n27:32.880 --> 27:38.560\n Excitement around the product. And we've replicated that when we launched in the US.\n\n27:38.560 --> 27:41.200\n We also built up an invite only program first.\n\n27:41.200 --> 27:46.160\n There are lots of tactics, but I think you need a great product to solve some problem.\n\n27:46.160 --> 27:51.440\n And basically the key innovation, there was technology,\n\n27:51.440 --> 27:55.600\n but on a meta level, the innovation was really the access model versus the ownership model.\n\n27:55.600 --> 27:56.880\n And that was tricky.\n\n27:56.880 --> 28:01.440\n A lot of people said that they wanted to be able to do it.\n\n28:01.440 --> 28:03.680\n I mean, they wanted to own their music.\n\n28:04.480 --> 28:07.520\n They would never kind of rent it or borrow it.\n\n28:07.520 --> 28:09.120\n But I think the fact that we had a free tier,\n\n28:09.120 --> 28:14.000\n which meant that you get to keep this music for life as well, helped quite a lot.\n\n28:14.560 --> 28:18.560\n So this is an interesting psychological point that maybe you can speak to.\n\n28:18.560 --> 28:20.080\n It was a big shift for me.\n\n28:22.240 --> 28:24.800\n It's almost like I had to go to therapy for this.\n\n28:26.240 --> 28:29.360\n I think I would describe my early listening experience,\n\n28:29.360 --> 28:32.480\n and I think a lot of my friends do, as basically hoarding music.\n\n28:33.280 --> 28:35.920\n As you're like slowly, one song by one song,\n\n28:35.920 --> 28:39.920\n or maybe albums, gathering a collection of music that you love.\n\n28:40.960 --> 28:42.080\n And you own it.\n\n28:42.080 --> 28:46.160\n It's like often, especially with CDs or tape, you like physically had it.\n\n28:46.960 --> 28:50.240\n And what Spotify, what I had to come to grips with,\n\n28:50.240 --> 28:55.520\n it was kind of liberating actually, is to throw away all the music.\n\n28:55.520 --> 28:58.480\n I've had this therapy session with lots of people.\n\n28:58.480 --> 29:02.560\n And I think the mental trick is, so actually we've seen the user data.\n\n29:02.560 --> 29:05.040\n When Spotify started, a lot of people did the exact same thing.\n\n29:05.040 --> 29:08.240\n They started hoarding as if the music would disappear.\n\n29:09.280 --> 29:10.880\n Almost the equivalent of downloading.\n\n29:10.880 --> 29:16.080\n And so we had these playlists that had limits of like a few hundred thousand tracks.\n\n29:16.080 --> 29:17.360\n We figured no one will ever.\n\n29:17.360 --> 29:18.560\n Well, they do.\n\n29:18.560 --> 29:20.960\n Nuts and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tracks.\n\n29:20.960 --> 29:25.760\n And to this day, some people want to actually save, quote unquote,\n\n29:25.760 --> 29:26.960\n and then play the entire catalog.\n\n29:26.960 --> 29:32.880\n But I think the therapy session goes something like instead of throwing away your music,\n\n29:34.080 --> 29:37.760\n if you took your files and you stored them in the locker at Google,\n\n29:38.720 --> 29:39.680\n it'd be a streaming service.\n\n29:39.680 --> 29:42.720\n It's just that in that locker, you have all the world's music now for free.\n\n29:42.720 --> 29:45.520\n So instead of giving away your music, you got all the music.\n\n29:45.520 --> 29:46.720\n It's yours.\n\n29:46.720 --> 29:50.240\n You could think of it as having a copy of the world's catalog there forever.\n\n29:50.240 --> 29:52.720\n So you actually got more music instead of less.\n\n29:52.720 --> 29:58.720\n It's just that you just took that hard disk and you sent it to someone who stored it for you.\n\n29:58.720 --> 30:01.440\n And once you go through that mental journey, I'm like, it's still my files.\n\n30:01.440 --> 30:02.560\n They're just over there.\n\n30:02.560 --> 30:05.520\n And I just have 40 million or 50 million or something now.\n\n30:05.520 --> 30:07.600\n Then people are like, OK, that's good.\n\n30:07.600 --> 30:10.880\n The problem is, I think, because you paid us a subscription,\n\n30:11.840 --> 30:14.000\n if we hadn't had the free tier where you would feel like,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:17.120\n even if I don't want to pay anymore, I still get to keep them.\n\n30:17.120 --> 30:18.480\n You keep your playlist forever.\n\n30:18.480 --> 30:20.240\n They don't disappear even though you stop paying.\n\n30:20.240 --> 30:21.760\n I think that was really important.\n\n30:21.760 --> 30:25.440\n If we would have started as, you know, you can put in all this time,\n\n30:25.440 --> 30:27.280\n but if you stop paying, you lose all your work.\n\n30:27.280 --> 30:31.760\n I think that would have been a big challenge and was the big challenge for a lot of our competitors.\n\n30:31.760 --> 30:34.880\n That's another reason why I think the free tier is really important.\n\n30:34.880 --> 30:37.600\n That people need to feel the security, that the work they put in,\n\n30:37.600 --> 30:39.920\n it will never disappear, even if they decide not to pay.\n\n30:40.800 --> 30:42.880\n I like how you put the work you put in.\n\n30:42.880 --> 30:44.480\n I actually stopped even thinking of it that way.\n\n30:44.480 --> 30:50.080\n I just actually Spotify taught me to just enjoy music as opposed to.\n\n30:50.080 --> 30:57.200\n As opposed to what I was doing before, which is like in an unhealthy way, hoarding music.\n\n30:58.560 --> 31:01.280\n Which I found that because I was doing that,\n\n31:01.280 --> 31:06.880\n I was listening to a small selection of songs way too much to where I was getting sick of them.\n\n31:07.520 --> 31:11.680\n Whereas Spotify, the more liberating kind of approach is I was just enjoying.\n\n31:11.680 --> 31:13.920\n Of course, I listened to Stairway to Heaven over and over,\n\n31:13.920 --> 31:18.240\n but because of the extra variety, I don't get as sick of them.\n\n31:18.240 --> 31:20.640\n There's an interesting statistic I saw.\n\n31:21.520 --> 31:26.640\n So Spotify has, maybe you can correct me, but over 50 million songs, tracks,\n\n31:27.600 --> 31:30.000\n and over 3 billion playlists.\n\n31:31.360 --> 31:35.520\n So 50 million songs and 3 billion playlists.\n\n31:35.520 --> 31:37.600\n 60 times more playlist songs.\n\n31:38.480 --> 31:39.360\n What do you make of that?\n\n31:39.920 --> 31:40.160\n Yeah.\n\n31:40.160 --> 31:48.320\n So the way I think about it is that from a statistician or machine learning point of view,\n\n31:48.320 --> 31:52.000\n you have all these, if you want to think about reinforcement learning,\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.320\n you have this state space of all the tracks.\n\n31:54.320 --> 31:57.280\n You can take different journeys through this world.\n\n32:00.160 --> 32:05.200\n I think of these as people helping themselves and each other,\n\n32:05.200 --> 32:08.720\n creating interesting vectors through this space of tracks.\n\n32:08.720 --> 32:14.080\n And then it's not so surprising that across many tens of millions of atomic units,\n\n32:14.080 --> 32:17.280\n there will be billions of paths that make sense.\n\n32:17.280 --> 32:21.920\n And we're probably pretty quite far away from having found all of them.\n\n32:21.920 --> 32:26.640\n So kind of our job now is users, when Spotify started,\n\n32:26.640 --> 32:30.000\n it was really a search box that was for the time pretty powerful.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:34.400\n And then I'd like to refer to it as this programming language called playlisting,\n\n32:34.400 --> 32:36.800\n where if you, as you probably were pretty good at music,\n\n32:36.800 --> 32:39.120\n you knew your new releases, you knew your back catalog,\n\n32:39.120 --> 32:40.480\n you knew your star with the heaven,\n\n32:40.480 --> 32:43.200\n you could create a soundtrack for yourself using this playlisting tool,\n\n32:43.200 --> 32:46.720\n this like meta programming language for music to soundtrack your life.\n\n32:47.360 --> 32:50.160\n And people who were good at music, it's back to how do you scale the product.\n\n32:50.960 --> 32:53.760\n For people who are good at music, that wasn't actually enough.\n\n32:53.760 --> 32:55.840\n If you had the catalog and a good search tool,\n\n32:55.840 --> 32:57.120\n and you can create your own sessions,\n\n32:57.120 --> 33:01.120\n you could create really good a soundtrack for your entire life.\n\n33:01.120 --> 33:04.000\n Probably perfectly personalized because you did it yourself.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.880\n But the problem was most people, many people aren't that good at music.\n\n33:06.880 --> 33:08.480\n They just can't spend the time.\n\n33:08.480 --> 33:10.800\n Even if you're very good at music, it's going to be hard to keep up.\n\n33:10.800 --> 33:16.400\n So what we did to try to scale this was to essentially try to build,\n\n33:16.400 --> 33:20.480\n you can think of them as agents that this friend that some people had\n\n33:20.480 --> 33:22.800\n that helped them navigate this music catalog.\n\n33:22.800 --> 33:24.240\n That's what we're trying to do for you.\n\n33:24.800 --> 33:32.640\n But also there is something like 200 million active users.\n\n33:32.640 --> 33:34.480\n 1 million active users on Spotify.\n\n33:35.040 --> 33:36.640\n So there it's okay.\n\n33:36.640 --> 33:38.720\n So from the machine learning perspective,\n\n33:39.760 --> 33:45.760\n you have these 200 million people plus they're creating.\n\n33:45.760 --> 33:49.840\n It's really interesting to think of a playlist as,\n\n33:51.760 --> 33:53.200\n I mean, I don't know if you meant it that way,\n\n33:53.200 --> 33:54.880\n but it's almost like a programming language.\n\n33:54.880 --> 34:01.120\n It's or at least a trace of exploration of those individual agents.\n\n34:01.120 --> 34:06.000\n The listeners and you have all this new tracks coming in.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:11.680\n So it's a fascinating space that is ripe for machine learning.\n\n34:11.680 --> 34:17.440\n So is there, is it possible, how can playlists be used as data\n\n34:18.080 --> 34:23.360\n in terms of machine learning and to help Spotify organize the music?\n\n34:24.160 --> 34:29.680\n So we found in our data, not surprising that people who play listed lots\n\n34:29.680 --> 34:30.720\n they retain much better.\n\n34:30.720 --> 34:32.240\n They had a great experience.\n\n34:32.240 --> 34:35.360\n And so our first attempt was to playlist for users.\n\n34:35.920 --> 34:41.360\n And so we acquired this company called Tunigo of editors and professional playlisters\n\n34:41.360 --> 34:45.600\n and kind of leveraged the maximum of human intelligence\n\n34:45.600 --> 34:51.440\n to help build kind of these vectors through the track space for people.\n\n34:52.480 --> 34:54.320\n And that broadened the product.\n\n34:54.320 --> 34:57.840\n But then the obvious next, and we use statistical means,\n\n34:57.840 --> 35:02.080\n where they could see when they created a playlist, how did that playlist perform?\n\n35:02.080 --> 35:04.800\n They could see skips of the songs, they could see how the songs perform,\n\n35:04.800 --> 35:10.720\n and they manually iterated the playlist to maximize performance for a large group of people.\n\n35:10.720 --> 35:14.480\n But there were never enough editors to playlists for you personally.\n\n35:14.480 --> 35:17.680\n So the promise of machine learning was to go from kind of group personalization\n\n35:18.240 --> 35:22.640\n using editors and tools and statistics to individualization.\n\n35:22.640 --> 35:28.160\n And then what's so interesting about the 3 billion playlists we have is we ended,\n\n35:28.160 --> 35:29.360\n the truth is we lucked out.\n\n35:29.360 --> 35:32.880\n This was not a priority strategy, as is often the case.\n\n35:32.880 --> 35:35.920\n It looks really smart in hindsight, but it was dumb luck.\n\n35:37.440 --> 35:42.160\n We looked at these playlists and we had some people in the company,\n\n35:42.160 --> 35:43.840\n a person named Eric Beranodson.\n\n35:43.840 --> 35:48.560\n He was really good at machine learning already back then in like 2007, 2008.\n\n35:48.560 --> 35:51.600\n Back then it was mostly collaborative filtering and so forth.\n\n35:51.600 --> 35:57.920\n But we realized that what this is, is people are grouping tracks for themselves\n\n35:57.920 --> 35:59.920\n that have some semantic meaning to them.\n\n36:00.640 --> 36:04.160\n And then they actually label it with a playlist name as well.\n\n36:04.160 --> 36:09.040\n So in a sense, people were grouping tracks along semantic dimensions and labeling them.\n\n36:09.840 --> 36:15.840\n And so could you use that information to find that latent embedding?\n\n36:15.840 --> 36:19.920\n And so we started playing around with collaborative filtering\n\n36:20.960 --> 36:24.160\n and we saw tremendous success with it.\n\n36:24.160 --> 36:28.320\n Basically trying to extract some of these dimensions.\n\n36:28.320 --> 36:30.160\n And if you think about it, it's not surprising at all.\n\n36:30.880 --> 36:34.880\n It'd be quite surprising if playlists were actually random,\n\n36:34.880 --> 36:36.160\n if they had no semantic meaning.\n\n36:36.880 --> 36:39.200\n For most people, they group these tracks for some reason.\n\n36:39.840 --> 36:43.120\n So we just happened across this incredible data set.\n\n36:43.120 --> 36:46.240\n Where people are taking these tens of millions of tracks\n\n36:46.800 --> 36:49.280\n and group them along different semantic vectors.\n\n36:49.280 --> 36:52.720\n And the semantics being outside the individual users.\n\n36:52.720 --> 36:54.400\n So it's some kind of universal.\n\n36:54.400 --> 36:59.760\n There's a universal embedding that holds across people on this earth.\n\n36:59.760 --> 37:05.440\n Yes, I do think that the embeddings you find are going to be reflective of the people who play listed.\n\n37:05.440 --> 37:09.040\n So if you have a lot of indie lovers who play list,\n\n37:09.040 --> 37:13.440\n your embedding is going to perform better there.\n\n37:14.800 --> 37:20.560\n But what we found was that yes, there were these latent similarities.\n\n37:20.560 --> 37:22.000\n They were very powerful.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:28.720\n And it was interesting because I think that the people who play listed the most initially\n\n37:28.720 --> 37:32.640\n were the so called music aficionados who were really into music.\n\n37:32.640 --> 37:34.240\n And they often had a certain...\n\n37:34.240 --> 37:38.240\n Their taste was often geared towards a certain type of music.\n\n37:38.800 --> 37:42.160\n And so what surprised us, if you look at the problem from the outside,\n\n37:42.160 --> 37:47.840\n you might expect that the algorithms would start performing best with mainstreamers first.\n\n37:47.840 --> 37:51.360\n Because it somehow feels like an easier problem to solve mainstream taste\n\n37:51.360 --> 37:52.640\n than really particular taste.\n\n37:53.360 --> 37:55.120\n It was the complete opposite for us.\n\n37:55.120 --> 37:58.640\n The recommendations performed fantastically for people who saw themselves as\n\n37:59.280 --> 38:00.960\n having very unique taste.\n\n38:00.960 --> 38:03.280\n That's probably because all of them play listed.\n\n38:03.280 --> 38:05.120\n And they didn't perform so well for mainstreamers.\n\n38:05.120 --> 38:09.440\n They actually thought they were a bit too particular and unorthodox.\n\n38:09.440 --> 38:12.000\n So we had the complete opposite of what we expected.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:13.920\n Success within the hardest problem first,\n\n38:13.920 --> 38:16.560\n and then had to try to scale to more mainstream recommendations.\n\n38:17.600 --> 38:24.160\n So you've also acquired Echo Nest that analyzes song data.\n\n38:24.160 --> 38:28.400\n So in your view, maybe you can talk about,\n\n38:28.400 --> 38:31.680\n so what kind of data is there from a machine learning perspective?\n\n38:31.680 --> 38:35.680\n From a machine learning perspective, there's a huge amount.\n\n38:35.680 --> 38:40.640\n We're talking about playlisting and just user data of what people are listening to,\n\n38:40.640 --> 38:43.920\n the playlist they're constructing, and so on.\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:48.080\n And then there's the actual data within a song.\n\n38:48.080 --> 38:51.920\n What makes a song, I don't know, the actual waveforms.\n\n38:54.160 --> 38:55.120\n How do you mix the two?\n\n38:55.680 --> 38:57.200\n How much value is there in each?\n\n38:57.200 --> 39:03.120\n To me, it seems like user data is a romantic notion\n\n39:03.120 --> 39:05.840\n that the song itself would contain useful information.\n\n39:05.840 --> 39:09.840\n But if I were to guess, user data would be much more powerful,\n\n39:09.840 --> 39:11.840\n like playlists would be much more powerful.\n\n39:11.840 --> 39:13.680\n Yeah, so we use both.\n\n39:14.800 --> 39:18.800\n Our biggest success initially was with playlist data\n\n39:18.800 --> 39:21.920\n without understanding anything about the structure of the song.\n\n39:22.480 --> 39:25.520\n But when we acquired Echo Nest, they had the inverse problem.\n\n39:25.520 --> 39:27.440\n They actually didn't have any play data.\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:29.680\n They were just, they were a provider of recommendations,\n\n39:29.680 --> 39:31.280\n but they didn't actually have any play data.\n\n39:31.840 --> 39:35.760\n So they looked at the structure of songs, sonically,\n\n39:36.640 --> 39:40.400\n and they looked at Wikipedia for cultural references and so forth, right?\n\n39:40.400 --> 39:41.920\n And did a lot of NLU and so forth.\n\n39:41.920 --> 39:46.880\n So we got that skill into the company and combined kind of our user data\n\n39:47.600 --> 39:51.600\n with their kind of content based.\n\n39:51.600 --> 39:53.200\n So you can think of it as we were user based\n\n39:53.200 --> 39:54.880\n and they were content based in their recommendations.\n\n39:54.880 --> 39:56.960\n And we combined those two.\n\n39:56.960 --> 40:00.240\n And for some cases where you have a new song that has no play data,\n\n40:00.240 --> 40:04.960\n obviously you have to try to go by either who the artist is\n\n40:04.960 --> 40:09.760\n or the sonic information in the song or what it's similar to.\n\n40:09.760 --> 40:12.720\n So there's definitely a value in both and we do a lot in both,\n\n40:12.720 --> 40:16.080\n but I would say, yes, the user data captures things\n\n40:16.080 --> 40:19.680\n that have to do with culture in the greater society\n\n40:19.680 --> 40:23.440\n that you would never see in the content itself.\n\n40:23.440 --> 40:27.920\n But that said, we have seen, we have a research lab in Paris\n\n40:28.880 --> 40:32.960\n when we can talk more about that on machine learning on the creator side,\n\n40:32.960 --> 40:34.880\n what it can do for creators, not just for the consumers,\n\n40:35.520 --> 40:38.640\n but where we looked at how does the structure of a song\n\n40:38.640 --> 40:40.800\n actually affect the listening behavior?\n\n40:40.800 --> 40:43.120\n And it turns out that there is a lot of,\n\n40:43.120 --> 40:48.480\n we can predict things like skips based on the song itself.\n\n40:48.480 --> 40:50.880\n We could say that maybe you should move that chorus a bit\n\n40:50.880 --> 40:52.720\n because your skip is going to go up here.\n\n40:52.720 --> 40:54.400\n There is a lot of latent structure in the music,\n\n40:54.400 --> 40:57.520\n which is not surprising because it is some sort of mind hack.\n\n40:58.640 --> 41:00.960\n So there should be structure. That's probably what we respond to.\n\n41:00.960 --> 41:04.560\n You just blew my mind actually from the creator perspective.\n\n41:05.520 --> 41:07.280\n So that's a really interesting topic\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:11.920\n that probably most creators aren't taking advantage of, right?\n\n41:11.920 --> 41:15.920\n So I've recently got to interact with a few folks,\n\n41:15.920 --> 41:24.320\n YouTubers who are like obsessed with this idea of what do I do\n\n41:24.320 --> 41:27.840\n to make sure people keep watching the video?\n\n41:27.840 --> 41:32.080\n And they like look at the analytics of which point do people turn it off and so on.\n\n41:32.720 --> 41:35.040\n First of all, I don't think that's healthy,\n\n41:35.040 --> 41:37.600\n but it's because you can do it a little too much.\n\n41:38.320 --> 41:42.240\n But it is a really powerful tool for helping the creative process.\n\n41:42.240 --> 41:46.480\n You just made me realize you could do the same thing for creation of music.\n\n41:47.280 --> 41:49.360\n And so is that something you've looked into?\n\n41:51.360 --> 41:54.800\n And can you speak to how much opportunity there is for that kind of thing?\n\n41:54.800 --> 41:59.200\n Yeah, so I listened to the podcast with Ziraj and I thought it was fantastic\n\n41:59.200 --> 42:03.600\n and I reacted to the same thing where he said he posted something in the morning,\n\n42:04.160 --> 42:06.560\n immediately watched the feedback where the drop off was\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:08.400\n and then responded to that in the afternoon,\n\n42:08.400 --> 42:12.080\n which is quite different from how people make podcasts, for example.\n\n42:12.080 --> 42:12.880\n Yes, exactly.\n\n42:12.880 --> 42:15.040\n I mean, the feedback loop is almost non existent.\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:21.120\n So if we back out one level, I think actually both for music and podcasts,\n\n42:21.120 --> 42:23.600\n which we also do at Spotify,\n\n42:23.600 --> 42:27.440\n I think there's a tremendous opportunity just for the creation workflow.\n\n42:27.440 --> 42:30.960\n And I think it's really interesting speaking to you who,\n\n42:30.960 --> 42:34.160\n because you're a musician, a developer, and a podcaster.\n\n42:34.720 --> 42:36.560\n If you think about those three different roles,\n\n42:36.560 --> 42:38.880\n if you make the leap as a musician,\n\n42:38.880 --> 42:42.080\n if you think about it as a software tool chain, really,\n\n42:42.960 --> 42:46.320\n your DAW with the stems, that's the IDE, right?\n\n42:46.320 --> 42:50.400\n That's where you work in source code format with what you're creating.\n\n42:51.120 --> 42:52.320\n Then you sit around and you play with that.\n\n42:52.320 --> 42:56.960\n And when you're happy, you compile that thing into some sort of AAC or MP3 or something.\n\n42:57.520 --> 42:59.040\n You do that because you get distribution.\n\n42:59.040 --> 43:02.240\n There are so many runtimes for that MP3 across the world in car stairs and stuff.\n\n43:02.240 --> 43:03.920\n So if you kind of compile this execution,\n\n43:03.920 --> 43:08.720\n you ship it out in kind of an old fashioned boxed software analogy.\n\n43:09.280 --> 43:11.760\n And then you hope for the best, right?\n\n43:11.760 --> 43:16.080\n But as a software developer, you would never do that.\n\n43:16.080 --> 43:18.640\n First, you go on GitHub and you collaborate with other creators.\n\n43:19.440 --> 43:22.800\n And then you think it'd be crazy to just ship one version of your software\n\n43:22.800 --> 43:26.800\n without doing an A B test, without any feedback loop.\n\n43:26.800 --> 43:28.320\n Issue tracking.\n\n43:28.320 --> 43:28.880\n Exactly.\n\n43:28.880 --> 43:31.760\n And then you would look at the feedback loop and say,\n\n43:31.760 --> 43:34.160\n try to optimize that thing, right?\n\n43:34.160 --> 43:37.840\n So I think if you think of it as a very specific software tool chain,\n\n43:38.880 --> 43:42.880\n it looks quite arcane, the tools that a music creator has\n\n43:42.880 --> 43:44.480\n versus what a software developer has.\n\n43:45.360 --> 43:47.040\n So that's kind of how we think about it.\n\n43:48.400 --> 43:52.640\n Why wouldn't a music creator have something like GitHub\n\n43:52.640 --> 43:54.000\n where you could collaborate much more easily?\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.560\n So we bought this company called Soundtrap,\n\n43:56.560 --> 44:01.680\n which has a kind of Google Docs for music approach, where you can collaborate\n\n44:01.680 --> 44:04.880\n with other people on the kind of source code format with Stems.\n\n44:05.600 --> 44:09.600\n And I think introducing things like AI tools there to help you\n\n44:09.600 --> 44:19.280\n as you're creating music, both in helping you put accompaniment to your music,\n\n44:19.280 --> 44:24.400\n like drums or something, help you master and mix automatically,\n\n44:24.400 --> 44:26.720\n help you understand how this track will perform.\n\n44:26.720 --> 44:29.600\n Exactly what you would expect as a software developer.\n\n44:29.600 --> 44:30.880\n I think it makes a lot of sense.\n\n44:30.880 --> 44:33.520\n And I think the same goes for a podcaster.\n\n44:33.520 --> 44:36.320\n I think podcasters will expect to have the same kind of feedback loop\n\n44:36.320 --> 44:39.520\n that Siraj has, like, why wouldn't you?\n\n44:39.520 --> 44:40.800\n Maybe it's not healthy, but...\n\n44:41.520 --> 44:45.120\n Sorry, I wanted to criticize the fact because you can overdo it\n\n44:45.120 --> 44:49.760\n because a lot of the, and we're in a new era of that.\n\n44:49.760 --> 44:56.400\n So you can become addicted to it and therefore, what people say,\n\n44:56.400 --> 44:59.680\n you become a slave to the YouTube algorithm or sort of,\n\n45:00.640 --> 45:04.400\n it's always a danger of a new technology as opposed to say,\n\n45:04.400 --> 45:11.600\n if you're creating a song, becoming too obsessed about the intro riff to the song\n\n45:11.600 --> 45:15.440\n that keeps people listening versus actually the entirety of the creation process.\n\n45:15.440 --> 45:16.160\n It's a balance.\n\n45:16.160 --> 45:19.680\n But the fact that there's zero, I mean, you're blowing my mind right now,\n\n45:19.680 --> 45:24.960\n because you're completely right that there is no signal whatsoever.\n\n45:24.960 --> 45:28.960\n There's no feedback whatsoever on the creation process and music or podcasting,\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:30.880\n almost at all.\n\n45:31.680 --> 45:39.360\n And are you saying that Spotify is hoping to help create tools to, not tools, but...\n\n45:39.360 --> 45:41.680\n No, tools actually.\n\n45:41.680 --> 45:42.640\n Actually, tools.\n\n45:42.640 --> 45:47.200\n Tools for creators.\n\n45:47.200 --> 45:47.760\n Absolutely.\n\n45:48.320 --> 45:53.520\n So we've made some acquisitions the last few years around music creation,\n\n45:53.520 --> 45:57.280\n this company called Soundtrap, which is a digital audio workstation,\n\n45:57.280 --> 45:59.040\n but that is browser based.\n\n45:59.040 --> 46:01.200\n And their focus was really the Google Docs approach.\n\n46:01.200 --> 46:06.080\n We can collaborate with people much more easily than you could in previous tools.\n\n46:06.080 --> 46:09.280\n So we have some of these tools that we're working with that we want to make accessible\n\n46:09.280 --> 46:12.960\n and then we can connect it with our consumption data.\n\n46:12.960 --> 46:16.000\n We can create this feedback loop where we could help you understand,\n\n46:16.800 --> 46:20.960\n we could help you create and help you understand how you will perform.\n\n46:20.960 --> 46:24.560\n We also acquired this other company within podcasting called Anchor,\n\n46:24.560 --> 46:28.400\n which is one of the biggest podcasting tools, mobile focused.\n\n46:28.400 --> 46:32.800\n So really focused on simple creation or easy access to creation.\n\n46:32.800 --> 46:34.960\n But that also gives us this feedback loop.\n\n46:34.960 --> 46:40.640\n And even before that, we invested in something called Spotify for Artists\n\n46:40.640 --> 46:43.600\n and Spotify for Podcasters, which is an app that you can download,\n\n46:43.600 --> 46:45.360\n you can verify that you are that creator.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:51.680\n And then you get things that software developers have had for years.\n\n46:51.680 --> 46:55.520\n You can see where, if you look at your podcast, for example, on Spotify\n\n46:55.520 --> 46:58.720\n or a song that you released, you can see how it's performing,\n\n46:58.720 --> 47:01.280\n which cities it's performing in, who's listening to it,\n\n47:01.280 --> 47:02.800\n what's the demographic breakup.\n\n47:02.800 --> 47:05.840\n So similar in the sense that you can understand\n\n47:05.840 --> 47:07.920\n how you're actually doing on the platform.\n\n47:08.880 --> 47:10.480\n So we definitely want to build tools.\n\n47:10.480 --> 47:15.200\n I think you also interviewed the head of research for Adobe.\n\n47:15.920 --> 47:19.680\n And I think that's an, back to Photoshop that you like,\n\n47:19.680 --> 47:21.680\n I think that's an interesting analogy as well.\n\n47:22.800 --> 47:28.000\n Photoshop, I think, has been very innovative in helping photographers and artists.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:32.320\n And I think there should be the same kind of tools for music creators,\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:35.680\n where you could get AI assistance, for example, as you're creating music,\n\n47:36.640 --> 47:38.880\n as you can do with Adobe, where you can,\n\n47:38.880 --> 47:41.440\n I want a sky over here and you can get help creating that sky.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:46.800\n The really fascinating thing is what Adobe doesn't have\n\n47:47.520 --> 47:49.760\n is a distribution for the content you create.\n\n47:50.400 --> 47:55.840\n So you don't have the data of if I create, if I, you know,\n\n47:55.840 --> 47:58.720\n whatever creation I make in Photoshop or Premiere,\n\n47:59.360 --> 48:02.480\n I can't get like immediate feedback like I can on YouTube,\n\n48:02.480 --> 48:05.360\n for example, about the way people are responding.\n\n48:05.360 --> 48:11.120\n And if Spotify is creating those tools, that's a really exciting actually world.\n\n48:11.680 --> 48:14.720\n But let's talk a little about podcasts.\n\n48:16.720 --> 48:18.720\n So I have trouble talking to one person.\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:23.120\n So it's a bit terrifying and kind of hard to fathom,\n\n48:23.120 --> 48:29.440\n but on average, 60 to 100,000 people will listen to this episode.\n\n48:30.320 --> 48:32.240\n Okay, so it's intimidating.\n\n48:32.240 --> 48:33.120\n Yeah, it's intimidating.\n\n48:34.320 --> 48:35.680\n So I hosted on Blueberry.\n\n48:36.720 --> 48:38.560\n I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly, actually.\n\n48:39.520 --> 48:42.400\n It looks like most people listen to it on Apple Podcasts,\n\n48:42.400 --> 48:48.480\n Cast Box and Pocket Casts, and only about a thousand listen on Spotify.\n\n48:48.480 --> 48:53.040\n It's just my podcast, right?\n\n48:53.840 --> 49:00.960\n So where do you see a time when Spotify will dominate this?\n\n49:00.960 --> 49:06.000\n So Spotify is relatively new into this podcasting site.\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:06.960\n Yeah, in podcasting.\n\n49:07.520 --> 49:09.920\n What's the deal with podcasting and Spotify?\n\n49:10.800 --> 49:13.440\n How serious is Spotify about podcasting?\n\n49:13.440 --> 49:16.800\n Do you see a time where everybody would listen to, you know,\n\n49:16.800 --> 49:21.520\n probably a huge amount of people, majority perhaps listen to music on Spotify?\n\n49:22.400 --> 49:26.880\n Do you see a time when the same is true for podcasting?\n\n49:26.880 --> 49:28.560\n Well, I certainly hope so.\n\n49:28.560 --> 49:29.360\n That is our mission.\n\n49:29.360 --> 49:34.160\n Our mission as a company is actually to enable a million creators to live off of their art,\n\n49:34.160 --> 49:35.840\n and a billion people be inspired by it.\n\n49:35.840 --> 49:40.000\n And what I think is interesting about that mission is it actually puts the creators first,\n\n49:40.640 --> 49:43.040\n even though it started as a consumer focused company,\n\n49:43.040 --> 49:44.800\n and it's just to be able to live off of their art,\n\n49:44.800 --> 49:47.280\n not just make some money off of their art as well.\n\n49:47.840 --> 49:49.920\n So it's quite an ambitious project.\n\n49:51.920 --> 49:53.920\n So we think about creators of all kinds,\n\n49:53.920 --> 50:00.160\n and we kind of expanded our mission from being music to being audio a while back.\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:07.360\n And that's not so much because we think we made that decision.\n\n50:08.400 --> 50:10.800\n We think that decision was made for us.\n\n50:10.800 --> 50:12.960\n We think the world made that decision.\n\n50:12.960 --> 50:16.560\n Whether we like it or not, when you put in your headphones,\n\n50:16.560 --> 50:24.400\n you're going to make a choice between music and a new episode of your podcast or something else.\n\n50:25.440 --> 50:26.960\n We're in that world whether we like it or not.\n\n50:26.960 --> 50:28.960\n And that's how radio works.\n\n50:28.960 --> 50:32.320\n So we decided that we think it's about audio.\n\n50:32.320 --> 50:34.480\n You can see the rise of audiobooks and so forth.\n\n50:34.480 --> 50:36.480\n We think audio is a great opportunity.\n\n50:36.480 --> 50:37.600\n So we decided to enter it.\n\n50:37.600 --> 50:45.280\n And obviously, Apple and Apple Podcasts is absolutely dominating in podcasting,\n\n50:45.280 --> 50:48.480\n and we didn't have a single podcast only like two years ago.\n\n50:49.440 --> 50:54.560\n What we did though was we looked at this and said,\n\n50:54.560 --> 50:55.920\n can we bring something to this?\n\n50:56.480 --> 50:59.200\n We want to do this, but back to the original Spotify,\n\n50:59.200 --> 51:03.840\n we have to do something that consumers actually value to be able to do this.\n\n51:03.840 --> 51:09.840\n And the reason we've gone from not existing at all to being quite a wide margin,\n\n51:09.840 --> 51:15.680\n the second largest podcast consumption, still wide gap to iTunes, but we're growing quite fast.\n\n51:16.480 --> 51:19.440\n I think it's because when we looked at the consumer problem,\n\n51:20.320 --> 51:26.960\n people said surprisingly that they wanted their podcasts and music in the same application.\n\n51:26.960 --> 51:29.760\n So what we did was we took a little bit of a different approach where we said,\n\n51:29.760 --> 51:31.440\n instead of building a separate podcast app,\n\n51:31.440 --> 51:33.680\n we thought, is there a consumer problem to solve here?\n\n51:33.680 --> 51:35.680\n Because the others are very successful already.\n\n51:35.680 --> 51:38.960\n And we thought there was in making a more seamless experience\n\n51:38.960 --> 51:43.120\n where you can have your podcast and your music in the same application,\n\n51:43.680 --> 51:45.440\n because we think it's audio to you.\n\n51:45.440 --> 51:46.800\n And that has been successful.\n\n51:46.800 --> 51:51.840\n And that meant that we actually had 200 million people to offer this to instead of starting from zero.\n\n51:52.400 --> 51:56.880\n So I think we have a good chance because we're taking a different approach than the competition.\n\n51:56.880 --> 51:59.120\n And back to the other thing I mentioned about\n\n51:59.120 --> 52:02.240\n creators, because we're looking at the end to end flow.\n\n52:02.800 --> 52:06.400\n I think there's a tremendous amount of innovation to do around podcast as a format.\n\n52:07.040 --> 52:12.640\n When we have creation tools and consumption, I think we could start improving what podcasting is.\n\n52:12.640 --> 52:18.960\n I mean, podcast is this opaque, big, like one, two hour file that you're streaming,\n\n52:19.520 --> 52:24.240\n which it really doesn't make that much sense in 2019 that it's not interactive.\n\n52:24.240 --> 52:26.000\n There's no feedback loops, nothing like that.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:29.760\n So I think if we're going to win, it's going to have to be because we build a better product\n\n52:29.760 --> 52:31.760\n for creators and for consumers.\n\n52:32.480 --> 52:34.640\n So we'll see, but it's certainly our goal.\n\n52:34.640 --> 52:35.600\n We have a long way to go.\n\n52:36.240 --> 52:38.160\n Well, the creators part is really exciting.\n\n52:38.160 --> 52:40.160\n You already, you got me hooked there.\n\n52:40.160 --> 52:41.760\n Cause the only stats I have,\n\n52:42.320 --> 52:47.760\n Blueberry just recently added the stats of whether it's listened to the end or not.\n\n52:48.560 --> 52:52.320\n And that's like a huge improvement, but that's still\n\n52:52.320 --> 52:54.960\n nowhere to where you could possibly go in terms of statistics.\n\n52:54.960 --> 52:57.200\n You just download the Spotify podcasters up and verify.\n\n52:57.200 --> 52:59.920\n And then, then you'll know where people dropped out in this episode.\n\n52:59.920 --> 53:00.400\n Oh, wow.\n\n53:00.400 --> 53:00.900\n Okay.\n\n53:01.600 --> 53:02.800\n The moment I started talking.\n\n53:02.800 --> 53:03.360\n Okay.\n\n53:03.360 --> 53:06.800\n I might be depressed by this, but okay.\n\n53:06.800 --> 53:13.040\n So one, um, one other question is the original Spotify for music.\n\n53:14.400 --> 53:19.120\n And I have a question about podcasting in this line is the idea of podcasting\n\n53:19.120 --> 53:22.880\n about podcasting in this line is the idea of albums.\n\n53:23.440 --> 53:28.800\n I have, uh, what did you, uh, music aficionados, uh, friends who are really,\n\n53:29.440 --> 53:33.280\n uh, big fans of music often, uh, really enjoy albums,\n\n53:33.280 --> 53:35.840\n listening to entire albums of, of an artist.\n\n53:36.400 --> 53:40.960\n Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like Spotify has helped\n\n53:40.960 --> 53:44.240\n replace the idea of an album with playlists.\n\n53:44.240 --> 53:46.000\n So you create your own albums.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.880\n It's, it's kind of the way, at least I've experienced music\n\n53:48.880 --> 53:50.480\n and I've really enjoyed it that way.\n\n53:51.040 --> 53:54.320\n One of the things that was missing in podcasting for me,\n\n53:54.880 --> 53:55.920\n I don't know if it's missing.\n\n53:56.320 --> 53:56.880\n I don't know.\n\n53:56.880 --> 53:59.920\n It's an open question for me, but the way I listened to podcasts is\n\n53:59.920 --> 54:01.600\n the way I would listen to albums.\n\n54:02.080 --> 54:05.440\n So I take a Joe Rogan experience and that's an album.\n\n54:05.600 --> 54:09.680\n And I listened, you know, I like, I, I put that on and I listened one\n\n54:09.680 --> 54:12.640\n episode after the next, then there's a sequence and so on.\n\n54:12.640 --> 54:17.520\n Is there a room for doing what you did for music or doing what\n\n54:17.520 --> 54:22.880\n Spotify did for music, but, uh, creating playlists, sort of, uh,\n\n54:22.880 --> 54:26.080\n this kind of playlisting idea of breaking apart from podcasting,\n\n54:27.120 --> 54:31.680\n uh, from individual podcasts and creating kind of, uh, this interplay\n\n54:31.680 --> 54:33.760\n or, or have you thought about that space?\n\n54:33.760 --> 54:34.800\n Uh, it's a great question.\n\n54:34.800 --> 54:38.640\n So I think in, um, in music, you're right.\n\n54:38.720 --> 54:39.920\n Basically you bought an album.\n\n54:39.920 --> 54:42.720\n So it was like, you bought a small catalog of like 10 tracks, right?\n\n54:42.800 --> 54:46.160\n It was, it was, again, it was actually a lot of, a lot of consumption.\n\n54:46.720 --> 54:49.360\n You think it's about what you like, but it's based on the business model.\n\n54:49.680 --> 54:53.920\n So you paid for this 10 track service and then you listened to that for a while.\n\n54:54.240 --> 54:57.760\n And then when, when everything was flat priced, you tended to listen differently.\n\n54:58.480 --> 55:01.360\n Now, so, so I think the, I think the album is still tremendously important.\n\n55:01.360 --> 55:03.360\n That's why we have it and you can save albums and so forth.\n\n55:03.360 --> 55:06.480\n And you have a huge amount of people who really listen according to albums.\n\n55:06.480 --> 55:09.840\n And I like that because it is a creator format, you can tell a longer story\n\n55:10.240 --> 55:11.440\n over several tracks.\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:13.840\n And so some people listen to just one track.\n\n55:13.840 --> 55:15.840\n Some people actually want to hear that whole story.\n\n55:17.520 --> 55:21.520\n Now in podcast, I think, I think it's different.\n\n55:21.600 --> 55:24.960\n You can argue that podcasts might be more like shows on Netflix.\n\n55:25.600 --> 55:29.200\n Have like a full season of Narcos and you're probably not going to do like\n\n55:29.200 --> 55:32.800\n one episode of Narcos and then one of House of Cards, like, like, you know,\n\n55:33.440 --> 55:34.480\n there's a narrative there.\n\n55:34.480 --> 55:37.440\n And you, you, you love the cast and you love these characters.\n\n55:37.440 --> 55:40.480\n So I think people will, people love shows.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.800\n And I think they will, they will listen to those shows.\n\n55:44.880 --> 55:46.880\n I do think you follow a bunch of shows at the same time.\n\n55:46.880 --> 55:50.480\n So there's certainly an opportunity to bring you the latest episode of, you\n\n55:50.480 --> 55:53.040\n know, whatever the five, six, 10 things that, that you're into.\n\n55:54.560 --> 56:00.000\n But, but I think, I think people are going to listen to specific hosts and love\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:01.600\n those hosts for a long time.\n\n56:01.600 --> 56:06.880\n Because I think there's something different with podcasts where, um, this\n\n56:06.880 --> 56:11.280\n format of the, the, the, the, the, the experience of the, of the audience is\n\n56:11.280 --> 56:12.800\n actually sitting here right between us.\n\n56:13.360 --> 56:16.960\n Whereas if you look at something on TV, the audio actually would come from, you\n\n56:16.960 --> 56:20.080\n would sit over there and the audio would come to you from both of us as if you\n\n56:20.080 --> 56:22.000\n were watching, not as you were part of the conversation.\n\n56:22.560 --> 56:27.280\n So my experience is having listened to podcasts like yours and Joe Rogan is, I\n\n56:27.280 --> 56:28.720\n feel like I know all of these people.\n\n56:28.720 --> 56:30.240\n They, they have a lot of experience.\n\n56:30.240 --> 56:33.600\n I know all of these people, they have no idea who I am, but I feel like I've\n\n56:33.600 --> 56:35.040\n listened to so many hours of that.\n\n56:35.040 --> 56:38.800\n It's very different from me watching a, watching like a TV show or an interview.\n\n56:39.440 --> 56:44.560\n So I think you, you kind of, um, fall in love with people and, um, experience\n\n56:44.560 --> 56:45.760\n in a, in a different way.\n\n56:45.760 --> 56:49.280\n So I think, I think shows and hosts are going to be very, uh, very important.\n\n56:49.280 --> 56:52.160\n I don't think that's going to go away into some sort of thing where, where you\n\n56:52.160 --> 56:53.360\n don't even know who you're listening to.\n\n56:53.360 --> 56:54.320\n I don't think that's going to happen.\n\n56:55.040 --> 56:59.760\n What I do think is I think there's a tremendous discovery opportunity in\n\n56:59.760 --> 57:03.040\n podcast because the catalog is growing quite quickly.\n\n57:03.920 --> 57:10.800\n And I think podcast is only a few, like five, 600,000 shows right now.\n\n57:11.360 --> 57:16.080\n If you look back to YouTube as another analogy of creators, no one really knows\n\n57:16.080 --> 57:20.400\n if you would lift the lid on YouTube, but it's probably billions of episodes.\n\n57:21.120 --> 57:24.960\n And so I think the podcast catalog would probably grow tremendously because the\n\n57:24.960 --> 57:27.040\n creation tools are getting easier.\n\n57:27.040 --> 57:30.800\n And then you're going to have this discovery opportunity that I think is\n\n57:30.800 --> 57:31.280\n really big.\n\n57:31.280 --> 57:35.600\n So, so a lot of people tell me that they love their shows, but discovering\n\n57:35.600 --> 57:36.880\n podcasts kind of suck.\n\n57:36.880 --> 57:38.720\n It's really hard to get into new show.\n\n57:38.720 --> 57:39.840\n They're usually quite long.\n\n57:39.840 --> 57:40.960\n It's a big time investment.\n\n57:40.960 --> 57:44.080\n So I think there's plenty of opportunity in the discovery part.\n\n57:45.600 --> 57:46.560\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n57:46.560 --> 57:51.200\n A hundred percent in, in even the dumbest, there's so many low hanging fruit too.\n\n57:51.200 --> 57:59.680\n Uh, for example, just knowing what episode to listen to first to try out a podcast.\n\n57:59.680 --> 58:00.400\n Exactly.\n\n58:00.400 --> 58:03.360\n Uh, because most podcasts don't have an order to them.\n\n58:03.920 --> 58:10.880\n Uh, they, they can be listened to out of order and sorry to say some are better\n\n58:10.880 --> 58:12.560\n than others episodes.\n\n58:12.560 --> 58:14.960\n So some episodes of Joe Rogan are better than others.\n\n58:15.520 --> 58:20.400\n And it's nice to know, uh, which you should listen to, to try it out.\n\n58:20.400 --> 58:26.320\n And there's, uh, as far as I know, almost no information, uh, in terms of like, uh,\n\n58:26.320 --> 58:28.640\n upvotes on how good an episode is.\n\n58:28.640 --> 58:29.280\n Exactly.\n\n58:29.280 --> 58:33.520\n So I think part of the problem is, uh, you, it's kind of like music.\n\n58:33.520 --> 58:34.480\n There isn't one answer.\n\n58:34.480 --> 58:37.440\n People use music for different things and there's actually many different types of music.\n\n58:37.440 --> 58:40.560\n There's workout music and there's classical piano music and focus music and,\n\n58:41.200 --> 58:42.640\n and, and, uh, so forth.\n\n58:42.640 --> 58:44.080\n I think the same with podcasts.\n\n58:44.080 --> 58:45.360\n Some podcasts are sequential.\n\n58:45.360 --> 58:48.400\n They're supposed to be listened to in, in order.\n\n58:48.400 --> 58:51.040\n It's actually, it's actually telling a narrative.\n\n58:51.040 --> 58:55.840\n Some podcasts are one topic, uh, kind of like yours, but different guests.\n\n58:55.840 --> 58:57.280\n So you could jump in anywhere.\n\n58:57.280 --> 58:59.440\n Some podcasts actually have completely different topics.\n\n58:59.440 --> 59:04.560\n And for those podcasts, it might be that I want, you know, we should recommend one episode\n\n59:04.560 --> 59:09.280\n because it's about AI from someone, but then they talk about something that you're not\n\n59:09.280 --> 59:10.880\n interested in the rest of the episodes.\n\n59:10.880 --> 59:15.040\n So I think our, what we're spending a lot of time on now is just first understanding\n\n59:15.040 --> 59:21.520\n the domain and creating kind of the knowledge graph of how do these objects relate and how\n\n59:21.520 --> 59:22.240\n do people consume.\n\n59:22.240 --> 59:24.800\n And I think we'll find that it's going to be, it's going to be different.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:31.280\n I'm excited because you're the, uh, Spotify is the first people I'm aware of that are\n\n59:32.240 --> 59:34.800\n trying to do this for podcasting.\n\n59:34.800 --> 59:38.240\n Podcasting has been like a wild west up until now.\n\n59:38.240 --> 59:43.120\n It's been a very, we want to be very careful though, because it's been a very good wild\n\n59:43.120 --> 59:45.680\n west, I think it's this fragile ecosystem.\n\n59:46.320 --> 59:52.080\n And I, we want to make sure that you don't barge in and say like, Oh, we're going to\n\n59:52.080 --> 59:53.440\n internetize this thing.\n\n59:53.440 --> 59:56.640\n And you have to think about the creators.\n\n59:56.640 --> 1:00:01.040\n You have to understand how they get distribution today, who listens to how they make money\n\n1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:05.520\n today, try to, you know, make sure that their business model works, that they understand.\n\n1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:10.880\n I think it's back to doing something to improving their products, like feedback loops and\n\n1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:11.440\n distribution.\n\n1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:17.280\n So jumping back into terms of this fascinating world of a recommender system and listening\n\n1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:24.320\n to music and using machine learning to analyze things, do you think it's better to what\n\n1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:30.160\n currently, correct me if I'm wrong, but currently Spotify lets people pick what they listen\n\n1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:31.680\n to the most part.\n\n1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:35.040\n There's a discovery process, but you kind of organize playlists.\n\n1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:39.840\n Is it better to let people pick what they listen to or recommend what they should listen\n\n1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:44.960\n to something like stations by Spotify that I saw that you're playing around with?\n\n1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:47.520\n Maybe you can tell me what's the status of that.\n\n1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:52.880\n This is a Pandora style app that just kind of, as opposed to you select the music you\n\n1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:57.760\n listen to, it kind of feeds you the music you listen to.\n\n1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:00.800\n What's the status of stations by Spotify?\n\n1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:01.920\n What's its future?\n\n1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:07.040\n The story of Spotify, as we have grown, has been that we made it more accessible to different\n\n1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:14.000\n audiences and stations is another one of those where the question is, some people want to\n\n1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:14.720\n be very specific.\n\n1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:18.560\n They actually want to hear Starway to Heaven right now, that needs to be very easy to do.\n\n1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:26.080\n And some people, or even the same person, at some point might say, I want to feel upbeat\n\n1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:32.800\n or I want to feel happy or I want songs to sing in the car.\n\n1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:38.720\n So they put in the information at a very different level and then we need to translate that into\n\n1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:40.560\n what that means musically.\n\n1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:45.440\n So stations is a test to create like a consumption input vector that is much simpler where you\n\n1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:49.520\n can just tune it a little bit and see if that increases the overall reach.\n\n1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:56.000\n But we're trying to kind of serve the entire gamut of super advanced so called music aficionados\n\n1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:02.560\n all the way to people who they love listening to music but it's not their number one priority\n\n1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:03.200\n in life.\n\n1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:06.160\n They're not going to sit and follow every new release from every new artist.\n\n1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:11.120\n They need to be able to influence music at a different level.\n\n1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:17.360\n So you can think of it as different products and I think one of the interesting things\n\n1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:22.080\n to answer your question on if it's better to let the user choose or to play, I think\n\n1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:28.720\n the answer is the challenge when machine learning kind of came along, there was a lot of thinking\n\n1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:33.120\n about what does product development mean in a machine learning context.\n\n1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:38.880\n People like Andrew Ng, for example, when he went to Baidu, he started doing a lot of practical\n\n1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:43.280\n machine learning, went from academia and he thought a lot about this and he had this notion\n\n1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:47.760\n that a product manager, designer and engineer, they used to work around this wireframe to\n\n1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:49.440\n kind of describe what the product should look like.\n\n1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:54.080\n It was something to talk about when you're doing a chatbot or a playlist, what are you\n\n1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:54.640\n going to say?\n\n1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:55.520\n It should be good.\n\n1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:57.360\n That's not a good product description.\n\n1:02:57.360 --> 1:02:58.400\n So how do you do that?\n\n1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:03.120\n And he came up with this notion that the test set is the new wireframe.\n\n1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:06.960\n The job of the product manager is to source a good test set that is representative of\n\n1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:10.640\n what, like if you say I want to play this, that is songs to sing in the car.\n\n1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:15.360\n The job of the product manager is to go and source a good test set of what that means.\n\n1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:20.000\n So then you can work with engineering to have algorithms to try to produce that.\n\n1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:25.600\n So we try to think a lot about how to structure product development for a machine learning\n\n1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:26.320\n age.\n\n1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:30.000\n And what we discovered was that a lot of it is actually in the expectation.\n\n1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:33.120\n And you can go two ways.\n\n1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:40.880\n So let's say that if you set the expectation with the user that this is a discovery product,\n\n1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:45.280\n like Discover Weekly, you're actually setting the expectation that most of what we show\n\n1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:46.800\n you will not be relevant.\n\n1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:50.400\n When you're in the discovery process, you're going to accept that actually if you find\n\n1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:55.200\n one gem every Monday that you totally love, you're probably going to be happy.\n\n1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:00.240\n Even though the statistical meaning, one out of 10 is terrible or one out of 20 is terrible\n\n1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:02.640\n from a user point of view because the setting was discovery is fine.\n\n1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:04.640\n Sorry to interrupt real quick.\n\n1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:11.600\n I just actually learned about Discover Weekly, which is a Spotify, I don't know, it's a\n\n1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:15.360\n feature of Spotify that shows you cool songs to listen to.\n\n1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:18.160\n Maybe I can do issue tracking.\n\n1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:19.760\n I couldn't find it on my Spotify app.\n\n1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:21.680\n It's in your library.\n\n1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:22.640\n It's in the library.\n\n1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:23.760\n It's in the list of library.\n\n1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:25.040\n Because I was like, whoa, this is cool.\n\n1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:26.320\n I didn't know this existed.\n\n1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:27.440\n And I tried to find it.\n\n1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:28.800\n But okay.\n\n1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:31.040\n I will show it to you and feedback to our product team.\n\n1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:32.720\n There you go.\n\n1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:34.480\n But yeah, so yeah, sorry.\n\n1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:42.160\n Just to mention the expectation there is basically that you're going to discover new songs.\n\n1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:42.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:47.200\n So then you can be quite adventurous in the recommendations you do.\n\n1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:53.120\n But we have another product called Daily Mix, which kind of implies that these are only\n\n1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:54.000\n going to be your favorites.\n\n1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:58.320\n So if you have one out of 10 that is good and nine out of 10 that doesn't work for you,\n\n1:04:58.320 --> 1:04:59.600\n you're going to think it's a horrible product.\n\n1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:03.040\n So actually a lot of the product development we learned over the years is about setting\n\n1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:04.080\n the right expectations.\n\n1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:09.680\n So for Daily Mix, you know, algorithmically, we would pick among things that feel very\n\n1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:11.280\n safe in your taste space.\n\n1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:15.520\n Whereas Discover Weekly, we go kind of wild because the expectation is most of this is\n\n1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:16.400\n not going to.\n\n1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:20.960\n So a lot of that, a lot of to answer your question there, a lot of should you let the\n\n1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:21.600\n user pick or not?\n\n1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:22.560\n It depends.\n\n1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:26.720\n We have some products where the whole point is that the user can click play, put the phone\n\n1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:30.000\n in the pocket, and it should be really good music for like an hour.\n\n1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.120\n We have other products where you probably need to say like, no, no, save, no, no.\n\n1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:36.160\n And it's very interactive.\n\n1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:37.440\n I see.\n\n1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:38.000\n That makes sense.\n\n1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.920\n And then the radio product, the stations product is one of these like click play, put in your\n\n1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:42.720\n pocket for hours.\n\n1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:44.160\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:50.880\n So you're thinking of different test sets for different users and trying to create products\n\n1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:57.840\n that sort of optimize for those test sets that represent a specific set of users.\n\n1:05:57.840 --> 1:06:06.160\n Yes, I think one thing that I think is interesting is we invested quite heavily in editorial\n\n1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:09.520\n in people creating playlists using statistical data.\n\n1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:10.800\n And that was successful for us.\n\n1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:12.960\n And then we also invested in machine learning.\n\n1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:18.000\n And for the longest time within Spotify and within the rest of the industry, there was\n\n1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:23.360\n always this narrative of humans versus the machine, algo versus editorial.\n\n1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:27.600\n And editors would say like, well, if I had that data, if I could see your\n\n1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:31.680\n playlisting history and I made a choice for you, I would have made a better choice.\n\n1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:35.200\n And they would have because they're much smarter than these algorithms.\n\n1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:38.880\n The human is incredibly smart compared to our algorithms.\n\n1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:40.880\n They can take culture into account and so forth.\n\n1:06:41.440 --> 1:06:47.600\n The problem is that they can't make 200 million decisions per hour for every user that logs\n\n1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:47.680\n in.\n\n1:06:47.680 --> 1:06:51.760\n So the algo may be not as sophisticated, but much more efficient.\n\n1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:54.480\n So there was this contradiction.\n\n1:06:54.480 --> 1:07:00.160\n But then a few years ago, we started focusing on this kind of human in the loop thinking\n\n1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:01.280\n around machine learning.\n\n1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:06.480\n And we actually coined an internal term for it called algotorial, a combination of algorithms\n\n1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:15.040\n and editors, where if we take a concrete example, you think of the editor, this paid\n\n1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:20.400\n expert that we have that's really good at something like soul, hip hop, EDM, something,\n\n1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:20.720\n right?\n\n1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:22.800\n They're a true expert, no one in the industry.\n\n1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.480\n So they have all the cultural knowledge.\n\n1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:26.560\n You think of them as the product manager.\n\n1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:32.880\n And you say that, let's say that you want to create a, you think that there's a product\n\n1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:36.160\n need in the world for something like songs to sing in the car or songs to sing in the\n\n1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:36.560\n shower.\n\n1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:38.400\n I'm taking that example because it exists.\n\n1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:41.840\n People love to scream songs in the car when they drive, right?\n\n1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:45.520\n So you want to create that product and you have this product manager who's a musical\n\n1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:46.000\n expert.\n\n1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:50.800\n They create, they come up with a concept, like I think this is a missing thing in humanity,\n\n1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:52.800\n like a playlist called songs to sing in the car.\n\n1:07:53.920 --> 1:07:59.840\n They create the framing, the image, the title, and they create a test set of, they create\n\n1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:04.480\n a group of songs, like a few thousand songs out of the catalog that they manually curate\n\n1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:06.960\n that are known songs that are great to sing in the car.\n\n1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:09.840\n And they can take like true romance into account.\n\n1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:12.400\n They understand things that our algorithms do not at all.\n\n1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:14.480\n So they have this huge set of tracks.\n\n1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:19.600\n Then when we deliver that to you, we look at your taste vectors and you get the 20 tracks\n\n1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:21.760\n that are songs to sing in the car in your taste.\n\n1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:29.520\n So you have personalization and editorial input in the same process, if that makes sense.\n\n1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:30.880\n Yeah, it makes total sense.\n\n1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:32.480\n And I have several questions around that.\n\n1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:35.280\n This is like fascinating.\n\n1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:36.560\n Okay.\n\n1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:44.720\n So first, it is a little bit surprising to me that the world expert humans are outperforming\n\n1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:49.920\n machines at specifying songs to sing in the car.\n\n1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:53.680\n So maybe you could talk to that a little bit.\n\n1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:57.040\n I don't know if you can put it into words, but what is it?\n\n1:08:57.760 --> 1:08:59.520\n How difficult is this problem?\n\n1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:06.720\n Do you really, I guess what I'm trying to ask is there, how difficult is it to encode\n\n1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:14.640\n the cultural references, the context of the song, the artists, all those things together?\n\n1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:16.720\n Can machine learning really not do that?\n\n1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:23.040\n I mean, I think machine learning is great at replicating patterns if you have the patterns.\n\n1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:27.680\n But if you try to write with me a spec of what song's greatest song to sing in the car\n\n1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:30.320\n definition is, is it loud?\n\n1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:31.520\n Does it have many choruses?\n\n1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:32.800\n Should it have been in movies?\n\n1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:35.680\n It quickly gets incredibly complicated, right?\n\n1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:36.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:40.960\n And a lot of it may not be in the structure of the song or the title.\n\n1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:44.880\n It could be cultural references because, you know, it was a history.\n\n1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:51.360\n So the definition problems quickly get, and I think that was the insight of Andrew Ng\n\n1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:55.440\n when he said the job of the product manager is to understand these things that algorithms\n\n1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:58.640\n don't and then define what that looks like.\n\n1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:00.880\n And then you have something to train towards, right?\n\n1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:02.720\n Then you have kind of the test set.\n\n1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:06.960\n And then so today the editors create this pool of tracks and then we personalize.\n\n1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:11.120\n You could easily imagine that once you have this set, you could have some automatic exploration\n\n1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:13.840\n on the rest of the catalog because then you understand what it is.\n\n1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:19.600\n And then the other side of it, when machine learning does help is this taste vector.\n\n1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:26.960\n How hard is it to construct a vector that represents the things an individual human\n\n1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:30.080\n likes, this human preference?\n\n1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:37.120\n So you can, you know, music isn't like, it's not like Amazon, like things you usually buy.\n\n1:10:38.320 --> 1:10:39.920\n Music seems more amorphous.\n\n1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:42.560\n Like it's this thing that's hard to specify.\n\n1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:48.080\n Like what is, you know, if you look at my playlist, what is the music that I love?\n\n1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:48.640\n It's harder.\n\n1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:54.080\n It seems to be much more difficult to specify concretely.\n\n1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.120\n So how hard is it to build a taste vector?\n\n1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:00.000\n It is very hard in the sense that you need a lot of data.\n\n1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:05.520\n And I think what we found was that, so it's not a stationary problem.\n\n1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:07.200\n It changes over time.\n\n1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:15.680\n And so we've gone through the journey of, if you've done a lot of computer vision,\n\n1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:18.320\n obviously I've done a bunch of computer vision in my past.\n\n1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:24.160\n And we started kind of with the handcrafted heuristics for, you know, this is kind of\n\n1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:24.800\n indie music.\n\n1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:25.360\n This is this.\n\n1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:27.440\n And if you consume this, you'd probably like this.\n\n1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:31.200\n So we have, we started there and we have some of that still.\n\n1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:34.720\n Then what was interesting about the playlist data was that you could find these latent\n\n1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:37.520\n things that wouldn't necessarily even make sense to you.\n\n1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.880\n That could even capture maybe cultural references because they cooccurred.\n\n1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:48.160\n Things that wouldn't have appeared kind of mechanistically either in the content or so\n\n1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:48.400\n forth.\n\n1:11:48.400 --> 1:12:01.280\n So I think that, I think the core assumption is that there are patterns in almost\n\n1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:01.840\n everything.\n\n1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:06.960\n And if there are patterns, these embedding techniques are getting better and better now.\n\n1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:12.400\n Now, as everyone else, we're also using kind of deep embeddings where you can encode\n\n1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:14.400\n binary values and so forth.\n\n1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:21.280\n And what I think is interesting is this process to try to find things that do not\n\n1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:23.920\n necessarily, you wouldn't actually have guessed.\n\n1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:28.560\n So it is very hard in an engineering sense to find the right dimensions.\n\n1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:33.920\n It's an incredible scalability problem to do for hundreds of millions of users and to\n\n1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:34.880\n update it every day.\n\n1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:42.160\n But in theory, in theory embeddings isn't that complicated.\n\n1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:46.240\n The fact that you try to find some principal components or something like that, dimensionality\n\n1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:47.040\n reduction and so forth.\n\n1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.240\n So the theory, I guess, is easy.\n\n1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:50.480\n The practice is very, very hard.\n\n1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:53.120\n And it's a huge engineering challenge.\n\n1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:58.400\n But fortunately, we have some amazing both research and engineering teams in this space.\n\n1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:03.200\n Yeah, I guess the question is all, I mean, it's similar.\n\n1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:05.360\n I deal with it with autonomous vehicle spaces.\n\n1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:07.680\n The question is how hard is driving?\n\n1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:12.560\n And here is basically the question is of edge cases.\n\n1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:22.240\n So embedding probably works, not probably, but I would imagine works well in a lot of\n\n1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:22.740\n cases.\n\n1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.840\n So there's a bunch of questions that arise then.\n\n1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:33.760\n So do song preferences, does your taste vector depend on context, like mood, right?\n\n1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:39.840\n So there's different moods, and so how does that take in it?\n\n1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:44.320\n Is it possible to take that as a consideration?\n\n1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:49.840\n Or do you just leave that as a interface problem that allows the user to just control it?\n\n1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:55.440\n So when I'm looking for workout music, I kind of specify it by choosing certain playlists,\n\n1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:56.560\n doing certain search.\n\n1:13:56.560 --> 1:13:58.560\n Yeah, so that's a great point.\n\n1:13:58.560 --> 1:14:00.080\n Back to the product development.\n\n1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:04.480\n You could try to spend a few years trying to predict which mood you're in automatically\n\n1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:08.320\n when you open Spotify, or you create a tab which is happy and sad, right?\n\n1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:10.880\n And you're going to be right 100% of the time with one click.\n\n1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.880\n Now, it's probably much better to let the user tell you if they're happy or sad, or\n\n1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:15.840\n if they want to work out.\n\n1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:20.480\n On the other hand, if your user interface becomes 2,000 tabs, you're introducing so\n\n1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:22.080\n much friction so no one will use the product.\n\n1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:23.520\n So then you have to get better.\n\n1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:26.800\n So it's this thing where you have to be able to get better.\n\n1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:32.640\n So then you have to get better, so it's this thing where I think maybe it was, I don't\n\n1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:35.040\n remember who coined it, but it's called fault tolerant UIs, right?\n\n1:14:35.040 --> 1:14:40.640\n You build a UI that is tolerant of being wrong, and then you can be much less right in your\n\n1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:43.120\n algorithms.\n\n1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:45.440\n So we've had to learn a lot of that.\n\n1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:52.160\n Building the right UI that fits where the machine learning is, and a great discovery\n\n1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:58.720\n there, which was by the teams during one of our hack days, was this thing of taking discovery,\n\n1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:04.880\n packaging it into a playlist, and saying that these are new tracks that we think you might\n\n1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:05.920\n like based on this.\n\n1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:09.440\n And setting the right expectation made it a great product.\n\n1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:15.920\n So I think we have this benefit that, for example, Tesla doesn't have that we can change\n\n1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:16.800\n the expectation.\n\n1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:18.640\n We can build a fault tolerant setting.\n\n1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:23.040\n It's very hard to be fault tolerant when you're driving at 100 miles per hour or something.\n\n1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:30.000\n And we have the luxury of being able to say that of being wrong if we have the right UI,\n\n1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.440\n which gives us different abilities to take more risk.\n\n1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:36.960\n So I actually think the self driving problem is much harder.\n\n1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:38.720\n Oh, yeah, for sure.\n\n1:15:39.680 --> 1:15:44.240\n It's much less fun because people die.\n\n1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:45.200\n Exactly.\n\n1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:55.040\n And in Spotify, it's such a more fun problem because failure is beautiful in a way.\n\n1:15:55.040 --> 1:15:56.320\n It leads to exploration.\n\n1:15:56.320 --> 1:15:58.640\n So it's a really fun reinforcement learning problem.\n\n1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:02.800\n The worst case scenario is you get these WTF tweets like, how did I get this?\n\n1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:03.600\n This song, yeah.\n\n1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:05.440\n Which is a lot better than the self driving.\n\n1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:14.400\n Exactly, so what's the feedback that a user, what's the signal that a user provides into\n\n1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:15.440\n the system?\n\n1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:17.920\n So you mentioned skipping.\n\n1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:20.880\n What is like the strongest signal?\n\n1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:23.520\n You didn't mention clicking like.\n\n1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.600\n So we have a few signals that are important.\n\n1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:30.240\n Obviously playing, playing through.\n\n1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:36.560\n So one of the benefits of music, actually, even compared to podcasts or movies is the\n\n1:16:36.560 --> 1:16:38.720\n object itself is really only about three minutes.\n\n1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:44.320\n So you get a lot of chances to recommend and the feedback loop is every three minutes instead\n\n1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:45.760\n of every two hours or something.\n\n1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:50.320\n So you actually get kind of noisy, but quite fast feedback.\n\n1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:55.200\n And so you can see if people play through, which is the inverse of skip really.\n\n1:16:55.200 --> 1:16:56.560\n That's an important signal.\n\n1:16:56.560 --> 1:17:00.320\n On the other hand, much of the consumption happens when your phone is in your pocket.\n\n1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:03.040\n Maybe you're running or driving or you're playing on a speaker.\n\n1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:05.600\n And so you not skipping doesn't mean that you love that song.\n\n1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:08.960\n It may be that it wasn't bad enough that you would walk up and skip.\n\n1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:10.560\n So it's a noisy signal.\n\n1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:14.000\n Then we have the equivalent of the like, which is you saved it to your library.\n\n1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.920\n That's a pretty strong signal of affection.\n\n1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:21.280\n And then we have the more explicit signal of playlisting.\n\n1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:23.920\n Like you took the time to create a playlist, you put it in there.\n\n1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:28.960\n There's a very little small chance that if you took all that trouble, this is not a really\n\n1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:30.480\n important track to you.\n\n1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:34.000\n And then we understand also what are the tracks it relates to.\n\n1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:39.120\n So we have the playlisting, we have the like, and then we have the listening or skip.\n\n1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:43.360\n And you have to have very different approaches to all of them because of different levels\n\n1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:44.400\n of noise.\n\n1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:49.760\n One is very voluminous, but noisy, and the other is rare, but you can probably trust it.\n\n1:17:49.760 --> 1:17:55.680\n Yeah, it's interesting because I think between those signals captures all the information\n\n1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:57.040\n you'd want to capture.\n\n1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:01.520\n I mean, there's a feeling, a shallow feeling for me that there's sometimes that I'll hear\n\n1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:05.920\n a song that's like, yes, this is, you know, this was the right song for the moment.\n\n1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:10.720\n But there's really no way to express that fact except by listening through it all the\n\n1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:14.240\n way and maybe playing it again at that time or something.\n\n1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:19.680\n But there's no need for a button that says this was the best song I could have heard\n\n1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:20.400\n at this moment.\n\n1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:24.080\n Well, we're playing around with that, with kind of the thumbs up concept saying like,\n\n1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:25.200\n I really like this.\n\n1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:27.520\n Just kind of talking to the algorithm.\n\n1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:30.640\n It's unclear if that's the best way for humans to interact.\n\n1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:31.200\n Maybe it is.\n\n1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:35.600\n Maybe they should think of Spotify as a person, an agent sitting there trying to serve you\n\n1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:38.080\n and you can say like, bad Spotify, good Spotify.\n\n1:18:38.720 --> 1:18:42.880\n Right now, the analogy we've had is more, you shouldn't think of us.\n\n1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:44.400\n We should be invisible.\n\n1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:48.320\n And the feedback is if you save it, it's kind of you work for yourself.\n\n1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:50.960\n You do a playlist because you think it's great and we can learn from that.\n\n1:18:50.960 --> 1:18:55.200\n It's kind of back to Tesla, how they kind of have this shadow mode.\n\n1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:56.720\n They sit in what you drive.\n\n1:18:56.720 --> 1:18:58.560\n We kind of took the same analogy.\n\n1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:02.800\n We sit in what you playlist and then maybe we can offer you an autopilot where you can\n\n1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:04.640\n take over for a while or something like that.\n\n1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:08.240\n And then back off if you say like, that's not good enough.\n\n1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:11.600\n But I think it's interesting to figure out what your mental model is.\n\n1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:18.880\n If Spotify is an AI that you talk to, which I think might be a bit too abstract for many\n\n1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:24.320\n consumers, or if you still think of it as it's my music app, but it's just more helpful.\n\n1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:30.160\n And it depends on the device it's running on, which brings us to smart speakers.\n\n1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:38.400\n So I have a lot of the Spotify listening I do is on devices I can talk to, whether it's\n\n1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:39.920\n from Amazon, Google or Apple.\n\n1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:42.320\n What's the role of Spotify on those devices?\n\n1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:46.720\n How do you think of it differently than on the phone or on the desktop?\n\n1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:52.080\n There are a few things to say about the first of all, it's incredibly exciting.\n\n1:19:52.080 --> 1:19:55.760\n They're growing like crazy, especially here in the US.\n\n1:19:58.320 --> 1:20:09.200\n And it's solving a consumer need that I think is, you can think of it as just remote interactivity.\n\n1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:11.840\n You can control this thing from across the room.\n\n1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:16.880\n And it may feel like a small thing, but it turns out that friction matters to consumers\n\n1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:22.000\n being able to say play, pause and so forth from across the room is very powerful.\n\n1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.200\n So basically, you made the living room interactive now.\n\n1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:33.600\n And what we see in our data is that the number one use case for these speakers is music,\n\n1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:34.960\n music and podcast.\n\n1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:39.920\n So fortunately for us, it's been important to these companies to have those use case\n\n1:20:39.920 --> 1:20:40.640\n covered.\n\n1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:42.080\n So they want to Spotify on this.\n\n1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:44.320\n We have very good relationships with them.\n\n1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:49.200\n And we're seeing tremendous success with them.\n\n1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:54.640\n What I think is interesting about them is it's already working.\n\n1:20:57.360 --> 1:21:02.720\n We kind of had this epiphany many years ago, back when we started using Sonos.\n\n1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:06.800\n If you went through all the trouble of setting up your Sonos system, you had this magical\n\n1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:10.400\n experience where you had all the music ever made in your living room.\n\n1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:16.320\n And we made this assumption that the home, everyone used to have a CD player at home,\n\n1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:19.040\n but they never managed to get their files working in the home.\n\n1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:22.240\n Having this network attached storage was too cumbersome for most consumers.\n\n1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:26.480\n So we made the assumption that the home would skip from the CD all the way to streaming\n\n1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:31.120\n books, where you would buy the steering and would have all the music built in.\n\n1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:32.640\n That took longer than we thought.\n\n1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:36.080\n But with the voice speakers, that was the unlocking that made kind of the connected\n\n1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:38.240\n speaker happen in the home.\n\n1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:41.520\n So it really exploded.\n\n1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:45.760\n And we saw this engagement that we predicted would happen.\n\n1:21:45.760 --> 1:21:48.560\n What I think is interesting, though, is where it's going from now.\n\n1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:51.120\n Right now, you think of them as voice speakers.\n\n1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:58.640\n But I think if you look at Google I.O., for example, they just added a camera to it, where\n\n1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:04.240\n when the alarm goes off, instead of saying, hey, Google, stop, you can just wave your\n\n1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:05.040\n hand.\n\n1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:11.920\n So I think they're going to think more of it as an agent or as an assistant, truly an\n\n1:22:11.920 --> 1:22:12.400\n assistant.\n\n1:22:12.400 --> 1:22:17.040\n And an assistant that can see you is going to be much more effective than a blind assistant.\n\n1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:18.480\n So I think these things will morph.\n\n1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:22.560\n And we won't necessarily think of them as, quote unquote, voice speakers anymore.\n\n1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:29.200\n Just as interactive access to the Internet in the home.\n\n1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:34.080\n But I still think that the biggest use case for those will be audio.\n\n1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:36.640\n So for that reason, we're investing heavily in it.\n\n1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:43.520\n And we built our own NLU stack to be able to the challenge here is, how do you innovate\n\n1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:44.240\n in that world?\n\n1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:48.320\n It lowers friction for consumers, but it's also much more constrained.\n\n1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:51.600\n You have no pixels to play with in an audio only world.\n\n1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:54.880\n It's really the vocabulary that is the interface.\n\n1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:58.560\n So we started investing and playing around quite a lot with that, trying to understand\n\n1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:03.360\n what the future will be of you speaking and gesturing and waving at your music.\n\n1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.480\n And actually, you're actually nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle space because from\n\n1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:14.080\n everything I've seen, the level of frustration people experience upon failure of natural\n\n1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:18.320\n language understanding is much higher than failure in other contexts.\n\n1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:20.400\n People get frustrated really fast.\n\n1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:25.600\n So if you screw that experience up even just a little bit, they give up really quickly.\n\n1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:26.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:28.320\n And I think you see that in the data.\n\n1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:36.160\n While it's tremendously successful, the most common interactions are play, pause and next.\n\n1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:39.440\n The things where if you compare it to taking up your phone, unlocking it, bringing up the\n\n1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:44.160\n app and skipping, clicking skip, it was much lower friction.\n\n1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:49.280\n But then for longer, more complicated things like, can you find me that song about the\n\n1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:51.920\n people still bring up the phone and search and then play it on their speaker?\n\n1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:56.960\n So we tried again to build a fault tolerant UI where for the more complicated things,\n\n1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:02.480\n you can still pick up your phone, have powerful full keyboard search and then try to optimize\n\n1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:07.280\n for where there is actually lower friction and try to it's kind of like the test autopilot\n\n1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:07.840\n thing.\n\n1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:11.040\n You have to be at the level where you're helpful.\n\n1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:15.040\n If you're too smart and just in the way, people are going to get frustrated.\n\n1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:18.080\n And first of all, I'm not obsessed with stairway to heaven.\n\n1:24:18.080 --> 1:24:19.440\n It's just a good song.\n\n1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:22.880\n But let me mention that as a use case because it's an interesting one.\n\n1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:28.160\n I've literally told one of I don't want to say the name of the speaker because when people\n\n1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:30.320\n are listening to it, it'll make their speaker go off.\n\n1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:34.720\n But I talked to the speaker and I say play stairway to heaven.\n\n1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:40.320\n And every time it like not every time, but a large percentage of the time plays the wrong\n\n1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:41.440\n stairway to heaven.\n\n1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:48.240\n It plays like some cover of the and that part of the experience.\n\n1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:55.120\n I actually wonder from a business perspective, does Spotify control that entire experience\n\n1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:55.600\n or no?\n\n1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:01.680\n It seems like the NLU, the natural language stuff is controlled by the speaker and then\n\n1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:04.640\n Spotify stays at a layer below that.\n\n1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:07.040\n It's a good and complicated question.\n\n1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:11.200\n Some of which is dependent on the on the partners.\n\n1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:13.280\n So it's hard to comment on the on the specifics.\n\n1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:15.840\n But the question is the right one.\n\n1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:21.280\n The challenge is if you can't use any of the personalization, I mean, we know which stairway\n\n1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:21.840\n to heaven.\n\n1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:26.400\n And the truth is maybe for for one person, it is exactly the cover that they want.\n\n1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:31.440\n And they would be very frustrated if a place I think we I think we default to the right\n\n1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:31.760\n version.\n\n1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:35.280\n But but you actually want to be able to do the cover for the person that just played\n\n1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:36.320\n the cover 50 times.\n\n1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:38.400\n Or Spotify is just going to seem stupid.\n\n1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:40.160\n So you want to be able to leverage the personalization.\n\n1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:46.320\n But you have this stack where you have the the ASR and this thing called the end best\n\n1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:48.480\n list of the best guesses here.\n\n1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:50.480\n And then the position comes in at the end.\n\n1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:53.280\n You actually want the person to be here when you're guessing about what they actually\n\n1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:54.000\n meant.\n\n1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:00.160\n So we're working with these partners and it's a complicated it's a complicated thing\n\n1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:02.880\n where you want to you want to be able.\n\n1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:06.800\n So first of all, you want to be very careful with your users data.\n\n1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:09.200\n You don't want to share your users data without the permission.\n\n1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:11.680\n But you want to share some data so that their experience gets better.\n\n1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:15.760\n So that these partners can understand enough, but not too much and so forth.\n\n1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:21.760\n So it's really the trick is that it's like a business driven relationship where you're\n\n1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:26.960\n doing product development across companies together, which is which is really complicated.\n\n1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:32.960\n But this is exactly why we built our own NLU so that we actually can make personalized\n\n1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:36.320\n guesses, because this is the biggest frustration from a user point of view.\n\n1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:40.160\n They don't understand about ASR and best list and and business deals.\n\n1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:41.440\n They're like, how hard can it be?\n\n1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:45.120\n I was told this thing 50 times this version and still the place the wrong thing.\n\n1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:46.240\n It can't it can't be hard.\n\n1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:48.640\n So we try to take the user approach.\n\n1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:53.360\n If the user the user is not going to understand the complications of business, we have to\n\n1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:53.760\n solve it.\n\n1:26:53.760 --> 1:27:02.240\n So let's talk about sort of a complicated subject that I myself I'm quite torn about\n\n1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:07.600\n the idea sort of of paying artists.\n\n1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:08.880\n Right.\n\n1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:17.200\n I saw as of August 31st, 2018, over 11 billion dollars were paid to rights holders.\n\n1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:21.200\n So and further distributed to artists from Spotify.\n\n1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:23.840\n So a lot of money is being paid to artists.\n\n1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:30.800\n First of all, the whole time as a consumer for me, when I look at Spotify, I'm not sure\n\n1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:34.880\n I'm remembering correctly, but I think you said exactly how I feel, which is this is\n\n1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:36.240\n too good to be true.\n\n1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:42.480\n Like when I start using Spotify, I assume you guys will go bankrupt in like a month.\n\n1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:44.400\n It's like this is too good.\n\n1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:45.200\n A lot of people did.\n\n1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:48.960\n I was like, this is amazing.\n\n1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:53.200\n So one question I have is sort of the bigger question.\n\n1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:55.200\n How do you make money in this complicated world?\n\n1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:03.840\n How do you deal with the relationship with record labels who are complicated?\n\n1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:14.080\n These big you're essentially have the task of herding cats, but like rich and powerful\n\n1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:21.520\n powerful cats, and also have the task of paying artists enough and paying those labels enough\n\n1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:26.480\n and still making money in the Internet space where people are not willing to pay hundreds\n\n1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:27.360\n of dollars a month.\n\n1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:30.720\n So how do you navigate the space?\n\n1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:31.600\n How do you navigate?\n\n1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:32.560\n That's a beautiful description.\n\n1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:33.520\n Herding rich cats.\n\n1:28:34.720 --> 1:28:35.280\n That before.\n\n1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:42.880\n It is very complicated, and I think certainly actually betting against Spotify has been\n\n1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:45.040\n statistically a very smart thing to do.\n\n1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:52.880\n Just looking at the at the line of roadkill in music streaming services, it's it's kind\n\n1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:58.560\n of I think if I understood the complexity when I joined Spotify, unfortunately, fortunately,\n\n1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:03.440\n I didn't know enough about the music industry to understand the complexities, because then\n\n1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:05.600\n I would have made a more rational guess that it wouldn't work.\n\n1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:08.480\n So, you know, ignorance is bliss.\n\n1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:13.200\n But I think there have been a few distinct challenges.\n\n1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:17.600\n I think, as I said, one of the things that made it work at all was that Sweden and the\n\n1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:19.200\n Nordics was a lost market.\n\n1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:24.160\n So there was no risk for labels to try this.\n\n1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:29.040\n I don't think it would have worked if if the market was healthy.\n\n1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:32.160\n So that was the initial condition.\n\n1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:36.160\n Then we had this tremendous challenge with the model itself.\n\n1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:39.520\n So now most people were pirating.\n\n1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:45.120\n But for the people who bought a download or a CD, the artists would get all the revenue\n\n1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:48.000\n for all the future plays then, right?\n\n1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.840\n So you got it all up front, whereas the streaming model was like almost nothing day one, almost\n\n1:29:51.840 --> 1:29:52.800\n nothing day two.\n\n1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:58.720\n And then at some point, this curve of incremental revenue would intersect with your day one\n\n1:29:58.720 --> 1:29:59.220\n payment.\n\n1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:05.280\n And that took a long time to play out before before the music labels, they understood\n\n1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:05.780\n that.\n\n1:30:05.780 --> 1:30:09.600\n But on the artist side, it took a lot of time to understand that actually, if I have a big\n\n1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:14.000\n hit that is going to be played for many years, this is a much better model because I get\n\n1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:18.000\n paid based on how much people use the product, not how much they thought they would use it\n\n1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:19.040\n day one or so forth.\n\n1:30:20.080 --> 1:30:22.880\n So it was a complicated model to get across.\n\n1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:24.000\n But time helped with that.\n\n1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:30.640\n And now the revenues to the music industry actually are bigger again than it's gone through\n\n1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:32.000\n this incredible dip and now they're back up.\n\n1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:36.480\n And so we're very proud of having been a part of that.\n\n1:30:37.920 --> 1:30:39.520\n So there have been distinct problems.\n\n1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:45.920\n I think when it comes to the labels, we have taken the painful approach.\n\n1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:52.400\n Some of our competition at the time, they kind of looked at other companies and said,\n\n1:30:52.400 --> 1:30:56.160\n if we just ignore the rights, we get really big, really fast.\n\n1:30:56.160 --> 1:31:00.480\n We're going to be too big for the labels to kind of, too big to fail.\n\n1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:01.120\n They're not going to kill us.\n\n1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:02.160\n We didn't take that approach.\n\n1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:06.960\n We went legal from day one and we negotiated and negotiated and negotiated.\n\n1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:07.600\n It was very slow.\n\n1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:08.240\n It was very frustrating.\n\n1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:12.240\n We were angry at seeing other companies taking shortcuts and seeming to get away with it.\n\n1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:18.160\n It was this game theory thing where over many rounds of playing the game, this would be\n\n1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:19.200\n the right strategy.\n\n1:31:19.200 --> 1:31:25.680\n And even though clearly there's a lot of frustrations at times during renegotiations, there is this\n\n1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:30.800\n there is this weird trust where we have been honest and fair.\n\n1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:32.480\n We've never screwed them.\n\n1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:33.680\n They've never screwed us.\n\n1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:39.280\n It's 10 years, but there's this trust and like they know that if music doesn't get\n\n1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:43.360\n really big, if lots of people do not want to listen to music and want to pay for it,\n\n1:31:43.360 --> 1:31:44.960\n Spotify has no business model.\n\n1:31:44.960 --> 1:31:47.040\n So we actually are incredibly aligned.\n\n1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:51.840\n Other companies, not to be tense, but other companies have other business models where\n\n1:31:51.840 --> 1:31:56.400\n even if they made no money from music, they'd still be profitable companies.\n\n1:31:56.400 --> 1:31:57.200\n But Spotify won't.\n\n1:31:57.200 --> 1:32:02.400\n So I think the industry sees that we are actually aligned business wise.\n\n1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:09.040\n So there is this trust that allows us to do product development, even if it's scary,\n\n1:32:11.040 --> 1:32:12.560\n taking risks.\n\n1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:17.200\n The free model itself was an incredible risk for the music industry to take that they should\n\n1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:17.920\n get credit for.\n\n1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:20.400\n Now, some of it was that they had nothing to lose in the game.\n\n1:32:20.400 --> 1:32:22.240\n Some of it was that they had nothing to lose in Sweden.\n\n1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:24.560\n But frankly, a lot of the labels also took risk.\n\n1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:31.360\n And so I think we built up that trust with I think herding of cats sounds a bit.\n\n1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:33.120\n What's the word?\n\n1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:35.280\n It sounds like dismissive of the cats.\n\n1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:35.920\n Dismissive.\n\n1:32:35.920 --> 1:32:37.200\n No, every cat matters.\n\n1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:39.360\n They're all beautiful and very important.\n\n1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:39.920\n Exactly.\n\n1:32:39.920 --> 1:32:42.800\n They've taken a lot of risks and certainly it's been frustrating.\n\n1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:47.600\n So it's really like playing it's game theory.\n\n1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:53.920\n If you play the game many times, then you can have the statistical outcome that you\n\n1:32:53.920 --> 1:32:54.560\n bet on.\n\n1:32:54.560 --> 1:32:57.520\n And it feels very painful when you're in the middle of that thing.\n\n1:32:57.520 --> 1:33:00.480\n I mean, there's risk, there's trust, there's relationships.\n\n1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:07.200\n From just having read the biography of Steve Jobs, similar kind of relationships were discussed\n\n1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:08.400\n in iTunes.\n\n1:33:08.400 --> 1:33:12.640\n The idea of selling a song for a dollar was very uncomfortable for labels.\n\n1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:13.760\n Exactly.\n\n1:33:13.760 --> 1:33:16.400\n And there was no, it was the same kind of thing.\n\n1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:21.840\n It was trust, it was game theory as a lot of relationships that had to be built.\n\n1:33:21.840 --> 1:33:28.880\n And it's really a terrifyingly difficult process that Apple could go through a little\n\n1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:31.920\n bit because they could afford for that process to fail.\n\n1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:37.600\n For Spotify, it seems terrifying because you can't.\n\n1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:44.240\n Initially, I think a lot of it comes down to honestly Daniel and his tenacity in negotiating,\n\n1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:50.800\n which seems like an impossible task because he was completely unknown and so forth.\n\n1:33:50.800 --> 1:33:54.160\n But maybe that was also the reason that it worked.\n\n1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:03.120\n But I think game theory is probably the best way to think about it.\n\n1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:08.800\n You could go straight for this Nash equilibrium that someone is going to defect or you play\n\n1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:14.240\n it many times, you try to actually go for the top left, the corporations sell.\n\n1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:19.680\n Is there any magical reason why Spotify seems to have won this?\n\n1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:25.360\n So a lot of people have tried to do what Spotify tried to do and Spotify has come out.\n\n1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:29.280\n Well, so the answer is that there's no magical reason because I don't believe in magic.\n\n1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.240\n But I think there are there are reasons.\n\n1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:39.600\n And I think some of them are that people have misunderstood a lot of what we actually do.\n\n1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:43.520\n The actual Spotify model is very complicated.\n\n1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:49.200\n They've looked at the premium model and said, it seems like you can charge $9.99 for music\n\n1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:52.000\n and people are going to pay, but that's not what happened.\n\n1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:55.680\n Actually, when we launched the original mobile product, everyone said they would never pay.\n\n1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:01.200\n What happened was they started on the free product and then their engagement grew so\n\n1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:05.680\n much that eventually they said, maybe it is worth $9.99, right?\n\n1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:08.880\n It's your propensity to pay gross with your engagement.\n\n1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:11.600\n So we have this super complicated business model.\n\n1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:15.200\n We operate two different business models, advertising and premium at the same time.\n\n1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:17.680\n And I think that is hard to replicate.\n\n1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:22.320\n I struggle to think of other companies that run large scale advertising and subscription\n\n1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:23.440\n products at the same time.\n\n1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:28.480\n So I think the business model is actually much more complicated than people think it is.\n\n1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:32.800\n And so some people went after just the premium part without the free part and ran into a\n\n1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:35.120\n wall where no one wanted to pay.\n\n1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:40.400\n Some people went after just music should be free, just ads, which doesn't give you enough\n\n1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:42.080\n revenue and doesn't work for the music industry.\n\n1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:46.560\n So I think that combination is kind of opaque from the outside.\n\n1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:51.040\n So maybe I shouldn't say it here and reveal the secret, but that turns out to be hard\n\n1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:54.400\n to replicate than you would think.\n\n1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:57.040\n So there's a lot of brilliant business strategies out there.\n\n1:35:57.040 --> 1:35:58.720\n Brilliant business strategy here.\n\n1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:01.280\n Brilliance or luck?\n\n1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:03.520\n Probably more luck, but it doesn't really matter.\n\n1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:05.440\n It looks brilliant in retrospect.\n\n1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:06.480\n Let's call it brilliant.\n\n1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:09.760\n Yeah, when the books are written, they'll be brilliant.\n\n1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:14.480\n You've mentioned that your philosophy is to embrace change.\n\n1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:23.600\n So how will the music streaming and music listening world change over the next 10 years,\n\n1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:24.640\n 20 years?\n\n1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:26.960\n You look out into the far future.\n\n1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:27.520\n What do you think?\n\n1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:35.200\n I think that music and for that matter, audio podcasts, audiobooks, I think it's one of\n\n1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:36.720\n the few core human needs.\n\n1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:41.680\n I think it there is no good reason to me why it shouldn't be at the scale of something\n\n1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:44.160\n like messaging or social networking.\n\n1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:48.160\n I don't think it's a niche thing to listen to music or news or something.\n\n1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:50.880\n So I think scale is obviously one of the things that I really hope for.\n\n1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:54.400\n I think I hope that it's going to be billions of users.\n\n1:36:54.400 --> 1:36:58.160\n I hope eventually everyone in the world gets access to all the world's music ever made.\n\n1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:01.120\n So obviously, I think it's going to be a much bigger business.\n\n1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:03.040\n Otherwise, we wouldn't be betting this big.\n\n1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:13.600\n Now, if you look more at how it is consumed, what I'm hoping is back to this analogy of\n\n1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:22.800\n the software tool chain, where I think I sometimes internally I make this analogy to text messaging.\n\n1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:28.480\n Text messaging was also based on standards in the area of mobile carriers.\n\n1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:32.720\n You had the SMS, the 140 character, 120 character SMS.\n\n1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:36.080\n And it was great because everyone agreed on the standards.\n\n1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:40.480\n So as a consumer, you got a lot of distributions and interoperability, but it was a very constrained\n\n1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:40.980\n format.\n\n1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:45.840\n And when the industry wanted to add pictures to that format to do the MMS, I looked it\n\n1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:48.720\n up and I think it took from the late 80s to early 2000s.\n\n1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:53.040\n This is like a 15, 20 year product cycle to bring pictures into that.\n\n1:37:53.920 --> 1:38:00.240\n Now, once that entire value chain of creation and consumption got wrapped in one software\n\n1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:07.280\n stack within something like Snapchat or WhatsApp, the first week they added disappearing messages.\n\n1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:09.600\n Then two weeks later, they added stories.\n\n1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:14.560\n The pace of innovation when you're on one software stack and you can affect both creation\n\n1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:17.120\n and consumption, I think it's going to be rapid.\n\n1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:22.320\n So with these streaming services, we now, for the first time in history, have enough,\n\n1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:25.040\n I hope, people on one of these services.\n\n1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:29.600\n Actually, whether it's Spotify or Amazon or Apple or YouTube, and hopefully enough\n\n1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:32.320\n creators that you can actually start working with the format again.\n\n1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:33.760\n And that excites me.\n\n1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:39.200\n I think being able to change these constraints from 100 years, that could really do something\n\n1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:40.160\n interesting.\n\n1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:45.680\n I really hope it's not just going to be the iteration on the same thing for the next 10\n\n1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:47.360\n to 20 years as well.\n\n1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:52.000\n Yeah, changing the creation of music, the creation of audio, the creation of podcasts\n\n1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.400\n is a really fascinating possibility.\n\n1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:59.040\n I myself don't understand what it is about podcasts that's so intimate.\n\n1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:00.480\n It just is.\n\n1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:01.840\n I listen to a lot of podcasts.\n\n1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:09.680\n I think it touches on a deep human need for connection that people do feel like they're\n\n1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:12.960\n connected to when they listen.\n\n1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:17.600\n I don't understand what the psychology of that is, but in this world that's becoming\n\n1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:24.160\n more and more disconnected, it feels like this is fulfilling a certain kind of need.\n\n1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:30.080\n And empowering the creator as opposed to just the listener is really interesting.\n\n1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:34.240\n I'm really excited that you're working on this.\n\n1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:38.800\n Yeah, I think one of the things that is inspiring for our teams to work on podcasts is exactly\n\n1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:44.720\n that, whether you think, like I probably do, that it's something biological about perceiving\n\n1:39:44.720 --> 1:39:47.840\n to be in the middle of the conversation that makes you listen in a different way.\n\n1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:48.640\n It doesn't really matter.\n\n1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:50.240\n People seem to perceive it differently.\n\n1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:55.600\n And there was this narrative for a long time that if you look at video, everything kind\n\n1:39:55.600 --> 1:39:59.840\n of in the foreground, it got shorter and shorter and shorter because of financial pressures\n\n1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:01.600\n and monetization and so forth.\n\n1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:06.240\n And eventually, at the end, there's almost like 20 seconds clip, people just screaming\n\n1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:14.640\n something and I feel really good about the fact that you could have interpreted that\n\n1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:16.880\n as people have no attention span anymore.\n\n1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:18.400\n They don't want to listen to things.\n\n1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:20.000\n They're not interested in deeper stories.\n\n1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.280\n People are getting dumber.\n\n1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:26.720\n But then podcasts came along and it's almost like, no, no, the need still existed.\n\n1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.240\n But maybe it was the fact that you're not prepared to look at your phone like this for\n\n1:40:32.240 --> 1:40:32.740\n two hours.\n\n1:40:32.740 --> 1:40:36.500\n But if you can drive at the same time, it seems like people really want to dig deeper\n\n1:40:36.500 --> 1:40:38.820\n and they want to hear like the more complicated version.\n\n1:40:38.820 --> 1:40:42.980\n So to me, that is very inspiring that that podcast is actually long form.\n\n1:40:42.980 --> 1:40:48.340\n It gives me a lot of hope for humanity that people seem really interested in hearing deeper,\n\n1:40:48.340 --> 1:40:49.940\n more complicated conversations.\n\n1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:52.100\n This is I don't understand it.\n\n1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:53.140\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:57.620\n So the majority for this podcast, listen to the whole thing.\n\n1:40:57.620 --> 1:41:02.500\n This whole conversation we've been talking for an hour and 45 minutes.\n\n1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:06.580\n And somebody will I mean, most people will be listening to these words I'm speaking right\n\n1:41:06.580 --> 1:41:06.580\n now.\n\n1:41:06.580 --> 1:41:07.080\n It's crazy.\n\n1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:10.740\n You wouldn't have thought that 10 years ago with where the world seemed to go.\n\n1:41:10.740 --> 1:41:12.100\n That's very positive, I think.\n\n1:41:12.100 --> 1:41:13.300\n That's really exciting.\n\n1:41:13.300 --> 1:41:17.060\n And empowering the creator there is really exciting.\n\n1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:18.740\n Last question.\n\n1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:22.660\n You also have a passion for just mobile in general.\n\n1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:32.660\n How do you see the smartphone world, the digital space of smartphones and just everything that's\n\n1:41:32.660 --> 1:41:39.780\n on the move, whether it's Internet of Things and so on, changing over the next 10 years\n\n1:41:39.780 --> 1:41:40.500\n and so on?\n\n1:41:41.460 --> 1:41:47.460\n I think that one way to think about it is that computing might be moving out of these\n\n1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:55.140\n multipurpose devices, the computer we had and the phone, into specific purpose devices.\n\n1:41:55.140 --> 1:42:01.060\n And it will be ambient that at least in my home, you just shout something at someone\n\n1:42:01.060 --> 1:42:03.380\n and there's always one of these speakers close enough.\n\n1:42:03.380 --> 1:42:06.980\n And so you start behaving differently.\n\n1:42:06.980 --> 1:42:11.460\n It's as if you have the Internet ambient, ambiently around you and you can ask it things.\n\n1:42:11.460 --> 1:42:15.780\n So I think computing will kind of get more integrated and we won't necessarily think\n\n1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:21.060\n of it as connected to a device in the same way that we do today.\n\n1:42:21.700 --> 1:42:22.900\n I don't know the path to that.\n\n1:42:22.900 --> 1:42:29.860\n Maybe we used to have these desktop computers and then we partially replaced that with the\n\n1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:32.740\n laptops and left the desktop at home when I work.\n\n1:42:32.740 --> 1:42:37.380\n And then we got these phones and we started leaving the mobile phones.\n\n1:42:37.380 --> 1:42:41.540\n We had the desktop at home when I work and then we got these phones and we started leaving\n\n1:42:41.540 --> 1:42:42.820\n the laptop at home for a while.\n\n1:42:42.820 --> 1:42:47.460\n And maybe for stretches of time you're going to start using the watch and you can leave\n\n1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:50.020\n your phone at home for a run or something.\n\n1:42:50.580 --> 1:42:58.420\n And we're on this progressive path where I think what is happening with voice is that\n\n1:43:00.740 --> 1:43:06.820\n you have an interaction paradigm that doesn't require as large physical devices.\n\n1:43:06.820 --> 1:43:12.820\n So I definitely think there's a future where you can have your AirPods and your watch and\n\n1:43:12.820 --> 1:43:14.980\n you can do a lot of computing.\n\n1:43:15.860 --> 1:43:20.020\n And I don't think it's going to be this binary thing.\n\n1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:23.380\n I think it's going to be like many of us still have a laptop, we just use it less.\n\n1:43:23.940 --> 1:43:25.940\n And so you shift your consumption over.\n\n1:43:26.820 --> 1:43:31.940\n And I don't know about AR glasses and so forth.\n\n1:43:31.940 --> 1:43:32.740\n I'm excited about it.\n\n1:43:32.740 --> 1:43:35.700\n I spent a lot of time in that area, but I still think it's quite far away.\n\n1:43:35.700 --> 1:43:37.540\n AR, VR, all of that.\n\n1:43:37.540 --> 1:43:39.780\n Yeah, VR is happening and working.\n\n1:43:39.780 --> 1:43:43.940\n I think the recent Oculus Quest is quite impressive.\n\n1:43:43.940 --> 1:43:45.300\n I think AR is further away.\n\n1:43:45.300 --> 1:43:46.580\n At least that type of AR.\n\n1:43:48.100 --> 1:43:54.660\n But I do think your phone or watch or glasses understanding where you are and maybe what\n\n1:43:54.660 --> 1:43:56.980\n you're looking at and being able to give you audio cues about that.\n\n1:43:56.980 --> 1:43:58.580\n Or you can say like, what is this?\n\n1:43:58.580 --> 1:43:59.700\n And it tells you what it is.\n\n1:44:00.980 --> 1:44:02.340\n That I think might happen.\n\n1:44:02.340 --> 1:44:08.020\n You use your watch or your glasses as a mouse pointer on reality.\n\n1:44:08.020 --> 1:44:09.460\n I think it might be a while before...\n\n1:44:09.460 --> 1:44:10.180\n I might be wrong.\n\n1:44:10.180 --> 1:44:10.820\n I hope I'm wrong.\n\n1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:14.820\n I think it might be a while before we walk around with these big lab glasses that project\n\n1:44:14.820 --> 1:44:15.620\n things.\n\n1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:16.260\n I agree with you.\n\n1:44:16.820 --> 1:44:22.260\n It's actually really difficult when you have to understand the physical world enough to\n\n1:44:23.060 --> 1:44:23.940\n project onto it.\n\n1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:26.740\n I lied about the last question.\n\n1:44:26.740 --> 1:44:32.660\n Go ahead, because I just thought of audio and my favorite topic, which is the movie\n\n1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:41.140\n Her, do you think, whether it's part of Spotify or not, we'll have, I don't know if you've\n\n1:44:41.140 --> 1:44:42.180\n seen the movie Her.\n\n1:44:42.180 --> 1:44:42.660\n Absolutely.\n\n1:44:45.060 --> 1:44:53.300\n And there, audio is the primary form of interaction and the connection with another entity that\n\n1:44:53.300 --> 1:44:59.300\n you can actually have a relationship with, that you fall in love with based on voice\n\n1:44:59.300 --> 1:45:00.740\n alone, audio alone.\n\n1:45:00.740 --> 1:45:04.820\n Do you think that's possible, first of all, based on audio alone to fall in love with\n\n1:45:04.820 --> 1:45:05.380\n somebody?\n\n1:45:05.380 --> 1:45:06.580\n Somebody or...\n\n1:45:06.580 --> 1:45:08.020\n Well, yeah, let's go with somebody.\n\n1:45:08.020 --> 1:45:11.700\n Just have a relationship based on audio alone.\n\n1:45:11.700 --> 1:45:18.500\n And second question to that, can we create an artificial intelligence system that allows\n\n1:45:18.500 --> 1:45:21.940\n one to fall in love with it and her, him with you?\n\n1:45:21.940 --> 1:45:29.940\n So this is my personal answer, speaking for me as a person, the answer is quite unequivocally\n\n1:45:29.940 --> 1:45:32.020\n yes on both.\n\n1:45:32.820 --> 1:45:36.580\n I think what we just said about podcasts and the feeling of being in the middle of a\n\n1:45:36.580 --> 1:45:42.660\n conversation, if you could have an assistant where, and we just said that feels like a\n\n1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:43.940\n very personal setting.\n\n1:45:43.940 --> 1:45:47.380\n So if you walk around with these headphones and this thing, you're speaking with this\n\n1:45:47.380 --> 1:45:49.940\n thing all of the time that feels like it's in your brain.\n\n1:45:49.940 --> 1:45:53.700\n I think it's going to be much easier to fall in love with than something that would be\n\n1:45:53.700 --> 1:45:54.740\n on your screen.\n\n1:45:54.740 --> 1:45:56.340\n I think that's entirely possible.\n\n1:45:56.340 --> 1:46:00.500\n And then from the, you can probably answer this better than me, but from the concept\n\n1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:07.060\n of if it's going to be possible to build a machine that can achieve that, I think whether\n\n1:46:07.060 --> 1:46:12.740\n you think of it as, if you can fake it, the philosophical zombie that assimilates it enough\n\n1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:17.700\n or it somehow actually is, I think there's, it's only a question.\n\n1:46:17.700 --> 1:46:20.500\n It's only a question if you ask me about time, I'd have a different answer.\n\n1:46:20.500 --> 1:46:24.580\n But if you say I've given some half infinite time, absolutely.\n\n1:46:24.580 --> 1:46:28.260\n I think it's just atoms and arrangement of information.\n\n1:46:29.620 --> 1:46:33.220\n Well, I personally think that love is a lot simpler than people think.\n\n1:46:33.780 --> 1:46:37.780\n So we started with true romance and ended in love.\n\n1:46:37.780 --> 1:46:39.780\n I don't see a better place to end.\n\n1:46:39.780 --> 1:46:40.340\n Beautiful.\n\n1:46:40.340 --> 1:46:41.860\n Gustav, thanks so much for talking today.\n\n1:46:41.860 --> 1:46:42.420\n Thank you so much.\n\n1:46:42.420 --> 1:46:43.140\n It was a lot of fun.\n\n1:46:43.140 --> 1:46:49.300\n It was fun.\n\n"
