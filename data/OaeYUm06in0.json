Deisseroth,\n\n00:10.560 --> 00:12.600\n professor of bioengineering, psychiatry,\n\n00:12.600 --> 00:15.600\n and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.\n\n00:15.600 --> 00:18.200\n He's one of the greatest living psychiatrists\n\n00:18.200 --> 00:20.480\n and neuroscientists in the world.\n\n00:20.480 --> 00:23.600\n He's also just a fascinating human being.\n\n00:23.600 --> 00:26.400\n We discuss both the darkest and the most beautiful places\n\n00:26.400 --> 00:28.560\n that the human mind can take us.\n\n00:28.560 --> 00:31.000\n He explores this in his book called\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:33.840\n Projections, A Story of Human Emotions.\n\n00:33.840 --> 00:35.760\n I highly recommend it.\n\n00:35.760 --> 00:38.300\n It's written masterfully.\n\n00:38.300 --> 00:40.240\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:40.240 --> 00:42.160\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:42.160 --> 00:43.360\n in the description.\n\n00:43.360 --> 00:47.200\n And now, dear friends, here's Karl Deisseroth.\n\n00:48.060 --> 00:50.600\n You open your book called Projections,\n\n00:50.600 --> 00:53.440\n A Story of Human Emotions with a few beautiful words\n\n00:53.440 --> 00:56.080\n to summarize all of humanity.\n\n00:56.080 --> 00:58.140\n The book draws insights about the human mind\n\n00:58.140 --> 01:01.200\n from modern psychiatry and neuroscience.\n\n01:01.200 --> 01:03.480\n So if it's okay, let me read a few sentences\n\n01:03.480 --> 01:05.000\n from the opening.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:08.800\n You gotta give props to beautiful writing when I see it.\n\n01:08.800 --> 01:13.800\n Quote, in the art of weaving, warp threads are structural\n\n01:13.920 --> 01:16.960\n and strong and anchored at the origin,\n\n01:16.960 --> 01:19.200\n creating a frame for crossing fibers\n\n01:19.200 --> 01:21.060\n as the fabric is woven.\n\n01:22.040 --> 01:25.200\n Projecting across the advancing edge into free space,\n\n01:25.200 --> 01:27.840\n warp threads bridge the formed past\n\n01:27.840 --> 01:32.000\n to the ragged present to the yet featureless future.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:35.720\n Yet featureless future, well done, well done, sir.\n\n01:35.720 --> 01:38.860\n The tapestry of the human story has its own warp threads,\n\n01:38.860 --> 01:41.560\n rooted deep in the gorges of East Africa,\n\n01:41.560 --> 01:44.280\n connecting the shifting textures of human life\n\n01:44.280 --> 01:47.760\n over millions of years, spanning pictographs\n\n01:47.760 --> 01:52.680\n backdroped by crevice ice, by angulated forestry,\n\n01:52.680 --> 01:56.040\n by stone and steel, and by glowing rare earths.\n\n01:56.040 --> 01:59.420\n The inner workings of the mind give form to these threads,\n\n01:59.420 --> 02:01.960\n creating a framework within us,\n\n02:01.960 --> 02:05.760\n upon which the story of each individual can come into being.\n\n02:05.760 --> 02:08.920\n Personal grain and color arise from the crossed threads\n\n02:08.920 --> 02:13.440\n of our moments and experiences, the fine weft of life,\n\n02:13.440 --> 02:16.600\n embedding and obscuring the underlying scaffold\n\n02:16.600 --> 02:19.520\n with intricate and sometimes lovely detail.\n\n02:19.520 --> 02:24.520\n Here are stories of this fabric fraying in those who are ill.\n\n02:24.520 --> 02:26.840\n In the minds of people for whom the warp\n\n02:26.840 --> 02:31.180\n is exposed and raw and revealing.\n\n02:31.180 --> 02:33.020\n What have you learned about human beings,\n\n02:33.020 --> 02:34.560\n human nature and the human mind,\n\n02:34.560 --> 02:38.240\n from those who suffer from psychiatric maladies,\n\n02:38.240 --> 02:41.240\n for those for whom this fabric is warped?\n\n02:41.240 --> 02:43.420\n And one thing we learn as biologists\n\n02:43.420 --> 02:45.560\n is that when something breaks,\n\n02:45.560 --> 02:50.560\n you see what the original unbroken part was for.\n\n02:50.800 --> 02:54.040\n And we see this in genetics, we see this in biochemistry.\n\n02:54.040 --> 02:57.440\n It's known that when you have a mutated gene,\n\n02:57.440 --> 02:59.900\n sometimes the gene is turned up in strength\n\n02:59.900 --> 03:01.320\n or turned down in strength,\n\n03:01.320 --> 03:03.280\n and that lets you see what it was originally for.\n\n03:03.280 --> 03:06.940\n You can infer true function from dysfunction.\n\n03:06.940 --> 03:11.160\n And this is a theme that I thought needed to be shared\n\n03:11.160 --> 03:13.320\n and needed to be made communicable\n\n03:13.320 --> 03:15.080\n to the lay public, to everybody.\n\n03:15.080 --> 03:19.440\n People who, which is, I think, almost all of us,\n\n03:19.440 --> 03:21.800\n who think and care about the inner workings of our mind,\n\n03:21.800 --> 03:26.360\n but who also care for those who have been suffering,\n\n03:26.360 --> 03:31.360\n who have mental health disorders, who face challenges.\n\n03:31.920 --> 03:33.760\n But then more broadly,\n\n03:33.760 --> 03:36.720\n it's a very much larger story than the present.\n\n03:36.720 --> 03:39.960\n There's a story to be told\n\n03:39.960 --> 03:42.200\n where the protagonist really is the human mind.\n\n03:42.200 --> 03:44.400\n And that was one thing I wanted to share as well\n\n03:44.400 --> 03:47.380\n in projections, is that broader story,\n\n03:47.380 --> 03:50.480\n but still anchored in the moment of patients,\n\n03:50.480 --> 03:53.960\n of people, of experiences of the moment.\n\n03:53.960 --> 03:57.320\n Is there a clear line between dysfunction and function,\n\n03:57.320 --> 03:58.600\n disorder and order?\n\n03:59.840 --> 04:02.440\n This is always debated in psychiatry,\n\n04:02.440 --> 04:05.560\n probably more so than any other medical specialty.\n\n04:06.440 --> 04:09.680\n I'm a psychiatrist, I treat patients still.\n\n04:09.680 --> 04:14.320\n I see acutely ill people who come to the emergency room\n\n04:14.320 --> 04:16.520\n where there's no doubt that this is not something\n\n04:16.520 --> 04:19.980\n that's working well, where the manifestation of disease\n\n04:19.980 --> 04:22.980\n is so powerful, where the person is suffering so greatly,\n\n04:22.980 --> 04:26.680\n where they cannot continue as they are.\n\n04:26.680 --> 04:28.000\n But of course, it's a spectrum,\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\n and there are people who are closer\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.560\n to the realm of being able to work okay in their jobs,\n\n04:34.560 --> 04:36.280\n but suffer from some small dysfunction.\n\n04:36.280 --> 04:37.860\n And everywhere in between.\n\n04:37.860 --> 04:39.400\n In psychiatry, we're careful to say\n\n04:39.400 --> 04:41.160\n we don't call it a disease or a disorder\n\n04:41.160 --> 04:43.200\n unless there's a disruption\n\n04:43.200 --> 04:45.520\n in social or occupational functioning.\n\n04:46.360 --> 04:49.320\n But of course, psychiatry has a long way to go\n\n04:49.320 --> 04:51.800\n in terms of developing quantitative tests.\n\n04:51.800 --> 04:55.840\n We don't have blood draws, we don't have imaging studies\n\n04:55.840 --> 04:57.800\n that we can use to diagnose.\n\n04:57.800 --> 05:00.920\n And so that line, ultimately, that you're asking about\n\n05:00.920 --> 05:04.440\n between order and disorder, function and dysfunction,\n\n05:04.440 --> 05:05.800\n it's operational at the moment.\n\n05:05.800 --> 05:06.960\n How are things working?\n\n05:08.440 --> 05:10.800\n Can we just linger on the terms for a second?\n\n05:10.800 --> 05:15.440\n So this disease, dysfunction,\n\n05:15.440 --> 05:17.960\n how careful should we be using those words?\n\n05:17.960 --> 05:20.220\n Can we just, even in this conversation,\n\n05:21.560 --> 05:24.400\n from a sort of technical perspective,\n\n05:24.400 --> 05:26.560\n but also a human perspective,\n\n05:26.560 --> 05:31.360\n how quick should we be\n\n05:31.360 --> 05:36.360\n in saying that schizophrenia, depression, autism,\n\n05:38.920 --> 05:42.860\n as we kind of go down across the spectrum\n\n05:42.860 --> 05:44.680\n of different maladies,\n\n05:44.680 --> 05:48.720\n to use the word dysfunction and disease?\n\n05:48.720 --> 05:50.760\n I would say to give ourselves license\n\n05:50.760 --> 05:53.000\n to capture the whole spectrum, let's say disorder,\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.160\n because that captures truly, I think, the essence of it,\n\n05:57.160 --> 05:59.680\n which is we need to talk about it when it's not working,\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:00.680\n when there's disorder.\n\n06:00.680 --> 06:05.680\n And that's the fairest and most inclusive term to use.\n\n06:08.040 --> 06:12.600\n So is it fair to assume that basically every member\n\n06:12.600 --> 06:15.840\n of the human species suffers from a large number\n\n06:15.840 --> 06:17.380\n of disorders then?\n\n06:17.380 --> 06:22.040\n Well, we just have to pick which ones are debilitating\n\n06:22.040 --> 06:23.080\n for each person?\n\n06:23.080 --> 06:25.200\n You know, if you look at the numbers,\n\n06:25.200 --> 06:29.880\n there are, if you look at how our mental health disorders\n\n06:29.880 --> 06:30.840\n are currently defined,\n\n06:30.840 --> 06:34.560\n you can look at population prevalence values\n\n06:34.560 --> 06:35.560\n for all these disorders,\n\n06:35.560 --> 06:37.880\n and you can come up with estimates\n\n06:37.880 --> 06:42.200\n that somebody will have a lifetime prevalence\n\n06:42.200 --> 06:44.680\n of having a psychiatric disorder\n\n06:44.680 --> 06:46.960\n that approaches 25% or so.\n\n06:46.960 --> 06:50.200\n And so that's, and in some studies it could be more,\n\n06:50.200 --> 06:51.480\n some studies it could be less.\n\n06:51.480 --> 06:53.300\n Now, what do we do with that number?\n\n06:53.300 --> 06:54.140\n What does that mean?\n\n06:54.140 --> 06:55.560\n And in some ways, that's the essence\n\n06:55.560 --> 06:58.920\n of what I was hoping to approach with the book,\n\n06:58.920 --> 07:01.080\n is to reflect on this spectrum that exists\n\n07:01.080 --> 07:02.040\n for all the disorders.\n\n07:02.040 --> 07:05.480\n There is, and taking nothing away from the severity\n\n07:05.480 --> 07:07.880\n and the suffering that comes at the extreme end\n\n07:07.880 --> 07:10.480\n of these illnesses, but nearly every one of them exists\n\n07:10.480 --> 07:14.920\n on a spectrum of severity, from nearly functional\n\n07:14.920 --> 07:17.320\n to completely dysfunctional, life threatening,\n\n07:17.320 --> 07:19.240\n and even fatal.\n\n07:19.240 --> 07:22.520\n And so that number, 25%, more or less,\n\n07:22.520 --> 07:27.520\n it doesn't capture that spectrum of severity.\n\n07:27.640 --> 07:30.480\n To look at that number, where do those numbers come from?\n\n07:30.480 --> 07:31.320\n Is it self report?\n\n07:31.320 --> 07:35.080\n Is it people who show up and say, I need help?\n\n07:35.080 --> 07:38.720\n Is it somebody else that points out that person needs help?\n\n07:38.720 --> 07:41.160\n Or is it like estimates that even go beyond that\n\n07:41.160 --> 07:42.880\n for people who don't ask for help\n\n07:42.880 --> 07:45.640\n or are suffering quietly alone?\n\n07:45.640 --> 07:47.600\n When you look at self report numbers,\n\n07:47.600 --> 07:50.780\n then those numbers get even higher, beyond 25% or more.\n\n07:52.440 --> 07:55.780\n Those, the most rigorous studies are done\n\n07:55.780 --> 07:57.600\n with structured psychiatric interviews\n\n07:57.600 --> 08:02.360\n where people who are trained in eliciting symptoms carefully\n\n08:02.360 --> 08:05.520\n do complete psychiatric inventories of individuals.\n\n08:05.520 --> 08:09.520\n And these are time consuming laborious studies\n\n08:09.520 --> 08:10.860\n that are not often repeated.\n\n08:10.860 --> 08:13.160\n When they're done, they're done well.\n\n08:13.160 --> 08:16.320\n But very often you'll see a report or something\n\n08:16.320 --> 08:19.020\n in the news of a very high number\n\n08:19.020 --> 08:22.080\n for some disorder or symptom.\n\n08:22.080 --> 08:24.500\n And very often, if it's shockingly high,\n\n08:24.500 --> 08:27.880\n that's coming from a self report of a person.\n\n08:27.880 --> 08:31.120\n And so that's another issue that we have, again,\n\n08:31.120 --> 08:33.600\n take nothing away from the severity and reality\n\n08:33.600 --> 08:35.840\n and biological nature of these disorders,\n\n08:35.840 --> 08:37.520\n which are very genetic, very, you know,\n\n08:37.520 --> 08:40.920\n we understand that these are very biological.\n\n08:40.920 --> 08:43.520\n And yet, we lack right now the lab tests\n\n08:43.520 --> 08:45.440\n and the blood draws to make the diagnoses.\n\n08:45.440 --> 08:48.240\n We'll talk about it, just how biological they are,\n\n08:48.240 --> 08:50.560\n because that too is a mystery.\n\n08:51.920 --> 08:53.760\n You know, in terms of from our perspective\n\n08:53.760 --> 08:55.360\n of how to probe into the disease,\n\n08:55.360 --> 08:57.640\n how to understand it, how to help it.\n\n08:57.640 --> 09:00.000\n So some of it could be neurobiological,\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:03.920\n some of it could be just the dance\n\n09:03.920 --> 09:05.680\n of human emotion and interaction.\n\n09:05.680 --> 09:10.680\n And it's like, is love when it works\n\n09:11.160 --> 09:14.400\n and is love when it breaks down biological\n\n09:14.400 --> 09:15.520\n or is it something else?\n\n09:15.520 --> 09:17.320\n So we're gonna talk about it.\n\n09:17.320 --> 09:20.460\n But let me just like to linger in terms of disorder.\n\n09:21.560 --> 09:23.520\n What about genius?\n\n09:23.520 --> 09:25.760\n You know, that sort of cliche saying,\n\n09:25.760 --> 09:28.100\n like the madness and genius\n\n09:28.100 --> 09:30.720\n that they kind of dance together.\n\n09:30.720 --> 09:33.360\n What about if the thing we see as disorder\n\n09:33.360 --> 09:37.540\n is actually genius, unheard or misunderstood?\n\n09:38.560 --> 09:40.280\n Well, here again, the numbers help us.\n\n09:40.280 --> 09:41.720\n And here's where being rigorous\n\n09:41.720 --> 09:43.280\n and quantitative actually really helps.\n\n09:43.280 --> 09:46.160\n If you look at disorders like autism\n\n09:46.160 --> 09:50.240\n and bipolar disorder and eating disorders,\n\n09:50.240 --> 09:52.080\n anorexia nervosa, for example,\n\n09:53.160 --> 09:56.920\n these, you know, particularly bipolar and anorexia,\n\n09:56.920 --> 10:00.760\n these can be fatal, they can cause immense suffering,\n\n10:00.760 --> 10:04.480\n but they are heavily genetic, all three of these.\n\n10:04.480 --> 10:07.760\n And what's very interesting is each one of these three\n\n10:07.760 --> 10:10.440\n is actually correlated positively,\n\n10:10.440 --> 10:13.680\n positively with measures of intelligence,\n\n10:13.680 --> 10:18.240\n of educational attainment, and even of income.\n\n10:18.240 --> 10:20.840\n And so you look at this severe disorders\n\n10:20.840 --> 10:25.480\n in many cases causing quite an immense morbidity\n\n10:25.480 --> 10:28.920\n and mortality, and yet they are positively correlated\n\n10:28.920 --> 10:31.200\n at the population level with positive things.\n\n10:31.200 --> 10:33.640\n Can you say the three again, autism?\n\n10:33.640 --> 10:37.320\n Autism, anorexia, and bipolar disorder.\n\n10:37.320 --> 10:38.400\n Bipolar, right.\n\n10:38.400 --> 10:40.340\n What's that book, forgot the book name,\n\n10:40.340 --> 10:42.520\n but is intelligence a burden?\n\n10:45.240 --> 10:48.080\n Well, you know, people can get into trouble\n\n10:48.080 --> 10:49.560\n when they think they're smarter than they are,\n\n10:49.560 --> 10:50.500\n I will say that.\n\n10:51.440 --> 10:52.440\n I don't know.\n\n10:52.440 --> 10:56.840\n Sometimes, like, in the deepest meaning of that statement,\n\n10:56.840 --> 10:58.220\n I think ignorance is bliss.\n\n10:58.220 --> 11:00.940\n I'm a big fan of Prince Mishkin from The Idiot\n\n11:00.940 --> 11:04.420\n and Aliosha from Brother Karamazov.\n\n11:04.420 --> 11:08.120\n Optimism can be seen as naivety and dumbness,\n\n11:08.120 --> 11:12.060\n but I think it's a kind of deep intelligence.\n\n11:13.200 --> 11:17.920\n Maybe inability to reason sort of about the mechanics\n\n11:17.920 --> 11:20.680\n of the world, but instead kind of feel the world.\n\n11:20.680 --> 11:24.280\n It seems like that's one of the paths to happiness.\n\n11:24.280 --> 11:25.120\n There is.\n\n11:25.120 --> 11:26.880\n How much you think versus how much you feel,\n\n11:26.880 --> 11:28.160\n this comes up all the time.\n\n11:28.160 --> 11:31.640\n In medicine, we encounter this all the time.\n\n11:31.640 --> 11:36.120\n Day after day, you encounter the abyss of suffering\n\n11:36.120 --> 11:36.960\n from patients.\n\n11:36.960 --> 11:38.420\n How much do you let yourself feel?\n\n11:39.500 --> 11:44.500\n Or how much do you make it abstract and objective\n\n11:44.560 --> 11:46.580\n and try to make it clinical?\n\n11:46.580 --> 11:49.080\n And that range, how you're able to move yourself\n\n11:49.080 --> 11:52.960\n on that spectrum, is very important for survival\n\n11:52.960 --> 11:57.800\n as a physician, and the way you protect yourself\n\n11:57.800 --> 12:00.200\n and your feelings turns out to be very important.\n\n12:00.200 --> 12:04.120\n You quote Finnegan's Wake, mad props for that,\n\n12:04.120 --> 12:05.200\n James Joyce book.\n\n12:05.200 --> 12:07.740\n I took a class in James Joyce in college.\n\n12:07.740 --> 12:10.600\n I think I read parts of Finnegan's Wake.\n\n12:10.600 --> 12:12.440\n I might have been on drugs of some kind,\n\n12:12.440 --> 12:15.720\n or I somehow got an A in that class,\n\n12:15.720 --> 12:18.000\n which probably refers to some kind of curve\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.800\n where nobody understood anything.\n\n12:19.800 --> 12:21.420\n The only thing I understood and really enjoyed\n\n12:21.420 --> 12:24.720\n is his short stories, The Dead, and then Ulysses.\n\n12:24.720 --> 12:27.360\n I kind of, I think, read a few Cliff Notes\n\n12:27.360 --> 12:28.880\n that kind of got to the point,\n\n12:28.880 --> 12:31.320\n and then Finnegan's Wake was just a hopeless.\n\n12:34.260 --> 12:35.680\n For people who haven't looked at it,\n\n12:35.680 --> 12:38.180\n maybe you can elucidate to me better,\n\n12:38.180 --> 12:43.180\n but I felt like I was reading things, words,\n\n12:43.400 --> 12:47.760\n and the words made sense, like standing next to each other,\n\n12:47.760 --> 12:51.520\n but when you kind of read for a while,\n\n12:51.520 --> 12:53.000\n you realize you didn't actually understand\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.080\n anything that was said.\n\n12:54.080 --> 12:55.880\n Right, but did you have a feeling, though?\n\n12:55.880 --> 12:59.280\n That's one thing I found interesting about Finnegan's Wake.\n\n12:59.280 --> 13:00.600\n I never fully understood it,\n\n13:00.600 --> 13:02.240\n but the words caused feelings in me,\n\n13:02.240 --> 13:03.880\n which I found fascinating,\n\n13:03.880 --> 13:06.840\n and sometimes I couldn't predict it\n\n13:06.840 --> 13:09.680\n from the semantic black and white context\n\n13:09.680 --> 13:11.960\n of what I was seeing in front of me on the page,\n\n13:11.960 --> 13:13.240\n but the rhythm or the melody\n\n13:13.240 --> 13:14.520\n would make me feel certain ways,\n\n13:14.520 --> 13:17.600\n and that was what I always was intrigued by with Joyce.\n\n13:17.600 --> 13:20.880\n Of course, that was his, he existed on a spectrum, too,\n\n13:20.880 --> 13:24.920\n and he wrote, as you say, more accessible works.\n\n13:24.920 --> 13:26.440\n I learned a lot about Irish history\n\n13:26.440 --> 13:28.740\n from Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\n\n13:28.740 --> 13:31.120\n and there was just, he could be as objective\n\n13:31.120 --> 13:35.240\n as he wanted to be, but then when he let himself loose,\n\n13:35.240 --> 13:37.780\n he was in this realm where the words\n\n13:37.780 --> 13:42.680\n had their own purpose separate from semantic meaning\n\n13:42.680 --> 13:46.120\n from their dry dictionary definition.\n\n13:46.120 --> 13:48.360\n You know, there's a funny story that was told,\n\n13:48.360 --> 13:49.700\n doesn't matter if it's true or not,\n\n13:49.700 --> 13:53.000\n but they said that James Joyce, when he was young,\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.360\n when he was in his teen years,\n\n13:54.360 --> 13:57.800\n would go around sort of Ireland drinking and so on\n\n13:57.800 --> 14:00.040\n and telling everybody that he's going to be one of,\n\n14:00.040 --> 14:03.040\n if not the greatest writers of the 20th century,\n\n14:03.040 --> 14:06.980\n and he turned out to be that.\n\n14:06.980 --> 14:09.740\n So I always think about that little story\n\n14:09.740 --> 14:10.840\n that somebody told me,\n\n14:11.700 --> 14:14.160\n because I have a lot of people come up to me,\n\n14:14.160 --> 14:16.260\n including myself, I'm a bit of a dreamer.\n\n14:17.880 --> 14:19.480\n You get into certain moods where you say\n\n14:19.480 --> 14:22.780\n I'm going to be the greatest anything ever.\n\n14:22.780 --> 14:27.200\n You get people tell you this, especially young people,\n\n14:27.200 --> 14:32.200\n and it kind of, it makes me feel all kinds of ways,\n\n14:32.200 --> 14:36.240\n but that story reminds me that you just might be\n\n14:36.240 --> 14:39.400\n one of the greatest writers of the 21st century,\n\n14:39.400 --> 14:41.440\n for example, if somebody were to tell me that,\n\n14:41.440 --> 14:44.960\n and don't immediately disregard that,\n\n14:44.960 --> 14:47.320\n because one of the people that say that,\n\n14:47.320 --> 14:49.320\n that's almost like a precondition,\n\n14:49.320 --> 14:51.600\n that's a good requirement just to believe in yourself.\n\n14:51.600 --> 14:53.080\n Maybe it's not a full requirement,\n\n14:53.080 --> 14:55.240\n but it's an interesting story.\n\n14:57.120 --> 14:58.300\n I think when someone tells you that,\n\n14:58.300 --> 15:02.880\n then it creates, one sees an opportunity,\n\n15:02.880 --> 15:03.960\n and then it would be a tragedy\n\n15:03.960 --> 15:05.560\n if the opportunity weren't captured, right?\n\n15:05.560 --> 15:09.080\n And so then that creates some impetus,\n\n15:09.080 --> 15:12.000\n some motivation to do something good.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:16.320\n I think the mind, it's like, I guess that's what\n\n15:16.320 --> 15:18.820\n books or whatever, I don't even know if it's a book,\n\n15:18.820 --> 15:21.320\n The Secret plugs into, they kind of make\n\n15:21.320 --> 15:23.440\n a whole industry out of it.\n\n15:23.440 --> 15:26.200\n But there is something about the mind\n\n15:26.200 --> 15:28.400\n believing something, making it a reality.\n\n15:28.400 --> 15:32.040\n It is just time and time again with Steve Jobs,\n\n15:32.040 --> 15:35.840\n your belief in yourself, your belief in an idea,\n\n15:35.840 --> 15:39.080\n sort of embracing the me versus the world,\n\n15:39.080 --> 15:42.000\n embracing the madness of this idea\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.420\n and making it a life pursuit,\n\n15:44.420 --> 15:46.440\n somehow morphs reality around you\n\n15:46.440 --> 15:48.620\n for some tiny fraction of the population.\n\n15:48.620 --> 15:50.960\n For everybody else, you descend into\n\n15:54.080 --> 15:56.680\n all the beautiful ways that failure\n\n15:56.680 --> 15:59.400\n materializes in our lifetime.\n\n15:59.400 --> 16:00.920\n Well, you know, you mentioned love earlier.\n\n16:00.920 --> 16:02.800\n I mean, that's a great example of how\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:05.360\n belief in something makes it real, right?\n\n16:05.360 --> 16:08.200\n It's not reasonable on the face of it,\n\n16:08.200 --> 16:09.560\n but because you believe it's reasonable,\n\n16:09.560 --> 16:10.920\n then it actually does become reasonable,\n\n16:10.920 --> 16:11.760\n and then it is real.\n\n16:11.760 --> 16:13.120\n And so that's a good example.\n\n16:13.120 --> 16:13.960\n That doesn't happen.\n\n16:13.960 --> 16:15.960\n I'm also in a bioengineering department.\n\n16:15.960 --> 16:18.480\n We don't imagine that a bridge is soundly built\n\n16:18.480 --> 16:19.520\n and then it is soundly built.\n\n16:19.520 --> 16:21.760\n That's something that, it doesn't come up\n\n16:21.760 --> 16:23.280\n in too many realms of human existence,\n\n16:23.280 --> 16:24.520\n but love is one of them.\n\n16:24.520 --> 16:29.520\n And the ability to have a fixed idea\n\n16:29.560 --> 16:32.400\n and to say it's true, and then it is true.\n\n16:32.400 --> 16:34.600\n A bridge is a kind of manifestation of love.\n\n16:34.600 --> 16:36.000\n So maybe it does work a little bit,\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.400\n but it can break down like Chernobyl did.\n\n16:38.400 --> 16:40.200\n You can't just say it's safe.\n\n16:40.200 --> 16:42.320\n You have to also prove it's safe.\n\n16:43.240 --> 16:45.880\n But on Finnegan's Wake, I think,\n\n16:45.880 --> 16:47.120\n maybe correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n16:47.120 --> 16:48.760\n you're using kind of Finnegan's Wake\n\n16:48.760 --> 16:52.320\n to give one perspective on what madness is,\n\n16:52.320 --> 16:53.760\n of what's going on in the mind.\n\n16:53.760 --> 16:58.760\n How much of that is that we're simply unable\n\n16:59.600 --> 17:01.000\n to communicate with the person\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.800\n on the other side of their mind?\n\n17:03.800 --> 17:07.560\n Like there's almost like a little person inside the brain\n\n17:07.560 --> 17:10.360\n and they have some circuitry that's used\n\n17:10.360 --> 17:12.840\n to communicate emotion, communicate ideas\n\n17:12.840 --> 17:14.040\n to the outside world.\n\n17:14.040 --> 17:15.640\n And there's something about that circuitry\n\n17:15.640 --> 17:17.200\n that makes it difficult to communicate\n\n17:17.200 --> 17:18.880\n with the little person on the other side.\n\n17:18.880 --> 17:21.200\n So if you look at what shows up in schizophrenia,\n\n17:21.200 --> 17:25.160\n with many cases, what we call thought disorders,\n\n17:25.160 --> 17:30.040\n what we call the individual speech symptoms\n\n17:30.040 --> 17:33.720\n of schizophrenia, Finnegan's Wake is loaded with them.\n\n17:33.720 --> 17:35.160\n And it's just full of them.\n\n17:35.160 --> 17:39.880\n We talk about clang associations in schizophrenia\n\n17:39.880 --> 17:44.000\n where the word that is said echoes in some way\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:44.840\n the previous word.\n\n17:44.840 --> 17:46.920\n And we call that a clang association\n\n17:46.920 --> 17:47.880\n because there's no other reason\n\n17:47.880 --> 17:49.320\n than the similarity of the sound,\n\n17:49.320 --> 17:53.200\n like a clang of a garage door being hit.\n\n17:53.200 --> 17:56.600\n And it has a, and sometimes it's not even a word,\n\n17:56.600 --> 17:59.960\n and we call that a neologism, a new word being created.\n\n17:59.960 --> 18:02.200\n And of course, Finnegan's Wake is full of that.\n\n18:02.200 --> 18:05.200\n And then we also, in schizophrenia,\n\n18:05.200 --> 18:06.960\n where there's what we call loose associations\n\n18:06.960 --> 18:10.000\n or tangential thought processes,\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.840\n of course, full of that where things just go off\n\n18:11.840 --> 18:15.280\n in directions that are not linear or logical.\n\n18:15.280 --> 18:18.640\n And you can't read Finnegan's Wake, I think,\n\n18:18.640 --> 18:21.480\n without, certainly as a psychiatrist,\n\n18:21.480 --> 18:24.120\n you can't read it without thinking about schizophrenia.\n\n18:24.120 --> 18:27.440\n And then when we look at the families of people\n\n18:27.440 --> 18:30.560\n with schizophrenia, and Joyce was no exception,\n\n18:30.560 --> 18:32.560\n there very often are people within the family\n\n18:32.560 --> 18:33.840\n who are on the spectrum.\n\n18:33.840 --> 18:34.960\n Some have it.\n\n18:34.960 --> 18:39.120\n Some are able to see it from a distance,\n\n18:39.120 --> 18:40.840\n from a safe distance.\n\n18:40.840 --> 18:43.040\n There's an association between schizophrenia\n\n18:43.040 --> 18:46.600\n and what we call schizotypal personality disorder\n\n18:46.600 --> 18:49.880\n where people are not quite in this severe state\n\n18:49.880 --> 18:51.880\n of schizophrenia but have some magical thinking,\n\n18:51.880 --> 18:54.560\n have some unusual thought patterns.\n\n18:54.560 --> 18:56.040\n Very often, those are family members\n\n18:56.040 --> 18:57.640\n of people with schizophrenia.\n\n18:57.640 --> 19:00.160\n So this points to this, again, to this idea\n\n19:00.160 --> 19:05.160\n that there is a range, even along this very severe,\n\n19:05.800 --> 19:09.440\n very genetic biological illness that human beings dwell\n\n19:09.440 --> 19:11.480\n on different spots along that spectrum.\n\n19:11.480 --> 19:14.360\n I should mention that we have my friend, Sergey,\n\n19:14.360 --> 19:16.840\n pulling up stuff, young Sergey or old Sergey,\n\n19:16.840 --> 19:17.760\n I don't know what to call you,\n\n19:17.760 --> 19:21.720\n but there's drafts of Finnegan's Wake.\n\n19:21.720 --> 19:24.080\n Yeah, I actually saw pictures of this from,\n\n19:25.480 --> 19:27.080\n I think it was on Instagram or something.\n\n19:27.080 --> 19:29.240\n These are early drafts of Finnegan's Wake.\n\n19:29.240 --> 19:30.400\n And it's so beautiful to see.\n\n19:30.400 --> 19:31.960\n For people who are just listening,\n\n19:31.960 --> 19:34.760\n there's just random paragraphs and writing\n\n19:34.760 --> 19:37.080\n all over the page with stuff crossed out.\n\n19:37.080 --> 19:40.280\n And it's great to see that Joyce himself\n\n19:40.280 --> 19:41.920\n was thinking in this kind of way\n\n19:41.920 --> 19:44.760\n as you're putting it together.\n\n19:44.760 --> 19:45.960\n How much do you think he was thinking\n\n19:45.960 --> 19:48.320\n about the schizophrenic mind?\n\n19:48.320 --> 19:49.160\n I think a lot.\n\n19:49.160 --> 19:51.520\n I think it's known that his daughter suffered\n\n19:51.520 --> 19:52.880\n from schizophrenia.\n\n19:52.880 --> 19:56.840\n And this is, what's depicted here on the page\n\n19:56.840 --> 20:00.600\n is something that I'm sure he either felt himself\n\n20:00.600 --> 20:03.440\n in some level was able to access\n\n20:03.440 --> 20:06.280\n this nonlinearity of processing\n\n20:06.280 --> 20:10.600\n or had seen enough in family that he knew what it was\n\n20:10.600 --> 20:13.360\n and was able to reflect it down\n\n20:13.360 --> 20:14.560\n in black and white on the paper.\n\n20:14.560 --> 20:17.640\n So what he was able to do was quite authentic\n\n20:17.640 --> 20:19.240\n in that sense.\n\n20:19.240 --> 20:21.880\n Of course, I don't want to pigeonhole him.\n\n20:21.880 --> 20:23.760\n He was doing much more than that.\n\n20:23.760 --> 20:27.440\n It was much more than talking about altered human\n\n20:29.400 --> 20:31.320\n thought processes and thought disorders.\n\n20:31.320 --> 20:34.800\n But that was an aspect that he was so good at representing\n\n20:34.800 --> 20:37.560\n that it had to be intentional to some extent.\n\n20:37.560 --> 20:38.760\n And a tiny tangent.\n\n20:38.760 --> 20:42.000\n What does your own writing look like for this book?\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:44.240\n Because it's extremely well written.\n\n20:44.240 --> 20:46.040\n How many edits?\n\n20:46.040 --> 20:48.120\n Did you just drink some whiskey\n\n20:48.120 --> 20:51.440\n and like I'm imagining Hemingway style?\n\n20:51.440 --> 20:53.480\n What's a very different, the writing is very different.\n\n20:53.480 --> 20:55.680\n I mean, it's really, really well written,\n\n20:55.680 --> 21:00.200\n which was like, I was reading it.\n\n21:00.200 --> 21:01.240\n It makes you realize,\n\n21:01.240 --> 21:03.640\n because I was expecting sort of a science kind of,\n\n21:03.640 --> 21:08.640\n which it is like elucidating something\n\n21:08.640 --> 21:09.920\n about the human mind kind of thing.\n\n21:09.920 --> 21:14.920\n But you could also probably write really strong novels.\n\n21:15.840 --> 21:17.000\n So maybe that's in the future.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.560\n But anyway, what is your, how many edits?\n\n21:19.560 --> 21:20.400\n What's your style?\n\n21:20.400 --> 21:21.320\n Does it look like that?\n\n21:21.320 --> 21:22.880\n Is it more structured, organized?\n\n21:22.880 --> 21:24.440\n Unfortunately, I used a laptop,\n\n21:24.440 --> 21:26.480\n so I didn't have this sort of a beautiful record.\n\n21:26.480 --> 21:29.520\n No typewriters, cigarette, and whiskey.\n\n21:29.520 --> 21:33.120\n I did explore which was their particular altered state\n\n21:33.120 --> 21:34.880\n that would help me to be most creative.\n\n21:34.880 --> 21:38.240\n And I found actually, I actually did the best\n\n21:38.240 --> 21:42.640\n while sober, but slightly disinhibited\n\n21:42.640 --> 21:46.320\n in the late hours of the night or early morning.\n\n21:46.320 --> 21:48.680\n Yeah, particularly late hours of the night there.\n\n21:50.040 --> 21:52.400\n I have a friend who would tell me\n\n21:52.400 --> 21:54.680\n that she thought that very early in the morning,\n\n21:54.680 --> 21:57.160\n her inner critic was still asleep\n\n21:57.160 --> 21:59.280\n and she could write more effectively\n\n21:59.280 --> 22:01.320\n before her inner critic woke up.\n\n22:01.320 --> 22:03.840\n And I actually found that outstanding advice for me\n\n22:03.840 --> 22:07.000\n that I often found that I was looser\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.360\n and could write more in the morning.\n\n22:09.360 --> 22:12.120\n But the other interesting thing is each chapter,\n\n22:12.120 --> 22:15.520\n each story, it's about a different human being\n\n22:15.520 --> 22:18.440\n with a different class of psychiatric disorder.\n\n22:18.440 --> 22:22.880\n That's what each story, each chapter is anchored in.\n\n22:22.880 --> 22:27.880\n But I'm trying to use words and style of writing\n\n22:27.960 --> 22:32.960\n and diction that captures the feeling of the disorder.\n\n22:32.960 --> 22:34.840\n And so it's different in each story.\n\n22:34.840 --> 22:39.480\n In the story about mania, which is a very expansive,\n\n22:39.480 --> 22:43.240\n exuberant, at least briefly uplifting state\n\n22:43.240 --> 22:45.160\n where the words come out in a torrent\n\n22:45.160 --> 22:48.600\n and they're complex and pressured and elaborate.\n\n22:48.600 --> 22:50.280\n I try to capture that feeling\n\n22:50.280 --> 22:52.480\n with the words used in that chapter.\n\n22:52.480 --> 22:56.560\n And then in the schizophrenia or psychosis chapter,\n\n22:56.560 --> 22:58.440\n where things slowly fragment over time\n\n22:58.440 --> 23:01.840\n and become looser and separated,\n\n23:01.840 --> 23:03.840\n I try to capture that in the writing too.\n\n23:03.840 --> 23:06.720\n So for each, it wasn't as if there was a single mode\n\n23:06.720 --> 23:08.320\n I could be in for the whole book.\n\n23:08.320 --> 23:11.240\n For each chapter, I had to put myself into a different mode\n\n23:11.240 --> 23:14.400\n to capture that inner feeling of the disorder.\n\n23:14.400 --> 23:17.520\n When you put yourself in that mode, does that change you?\n\n23:17.520 --> 23:19.900\n Yeah, I couldn't turn it on and off right away.\n\n23:19.900 --> 23:23.880\n I had to, first I would start by thinking about the person\n\n23:23.880 --> 23:26.240\n or the people, one or two people based on real patients\n\n23:26.240 --> 23:29.960\n and the stories that are put forth.\n\n23:29.960 --> 23:31.360\n The symptom descriptions are real,\n\n23:31.360 --> 23:32.240\n they're from the patients.\n\n23:32.240 --> 23:35.400\n Of course, all details change to protect privacy,\n\n23:35.400 --> 23:38.040\n but the actual symptom descriptions are real.\n\n23:38.040 --> 23:41.240\n And I would sit with them and really try to inhabit\n\n23:41.240 --> 23:45.640\n the space of the mind of that person that I knew.\n\n23:45.640 --> 23:47.520\n And that's not instantaneous.\n\n23:47.520 --> 23:48.840\n It would take some time.\n\n23:48.840 --> 23:51.200\n I needed quiet, I needed to be still.\n\n23:51.200 --> 23:53.700\n That's another reason late at night is good.\n\n23:53.700 --> 23:56.800\n Sergey posted that drowsiness gives creativity boosts,\n\n23:56.800 --> 23:58.840\n according to Andrew Huberman.\n\n23:58.840 --> 23:59.840\n Thank you, Andrew.\n\n23:59.840 --> 24:03.160\n He's not wrong, he's not wrong.\n\n24:03.160 --> 24:04.840\n Why projections?\n\n24:04.840 --> 24:09.840\n Is it, I mean, instead of putting words into your mouth,\n\n24:09.840 --> 24:11.320\n because I can imagine a lot.\n\n24:11.320 --> 24:15.680\n I mean, to me, I will start putting words in your mouth,\n\n24:15.680 --> 24:16.920\n despite what I just said.\n\n24:18.120 --> 24:20.480\n So, I mean, to me, projections,\n\n24:20.480 --> 24:22.000\n working on neural networks, for example,\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.360\n from an artificial neural networks,\n\n24:23.360 --> 24:25.240\n from a machine learning perspective,\n\n24:25.240 --> 24:27.520\n it's often, that's exactly what you're doing.\n\n24:27.520 --> 24:29.280\n You have an incredibly complex thing\n\n24:29.280 --> 24:32.960\n and you're trying to find simple representations\n\n24:32.960 --> 24:34.640\n in order for you to make sense of it.\n\n24:34.640 --> 24:36.760\n So I was kind of thinking about in that way,\n\n24:36.760 --> 24:41.760\n which is like this incredibly complex neural network\n\n24:43.080 --> 24:46.920\n that is kind of projecting itself onto the world\n\n24:46.920 --> 24:51.040\n through this low bandwidth expression of emotion and speech\n\n24:51.040 --> 24:52.280\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n24:52.280 --> 24:57.000\n And the way it's, we only have that window into your soul,\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.440\n the eyes and the speech and so on.\n\n24:58.440 --> 25:03.440\n So in that way, when there's any kind of disorder,\n\n25:03.440 --> 25:08.160\n we get to only see that disorder through that narrow window\n\n25:08.160 --> 25:11.120\n as opposed to the full complexity of its origins.\n\n25:11.120 --> 25:13.880\n The word projections definitely serves that purpose here,\n\n25:13.880 --> 25:17.640\n but it's got a few other really appropriate\n\n25:17.640 --> 25:19.360\n other connotations as well.\n\n25:19.360 --> 25:20.920\n So the first thing is a projection\n\n25:20.920 --> 25:24.800\n in terms of neuroscience is this long range connection\n\n25:24.800 --> 25:26.880\n that goes from one part of the brain to another.\n\n25:26.880 --> 25:30.560\n And so it's what binds two parts of our brain together.\n\n25:30.560 --> 25:33.080\n There are projections, long range connections\n\n25:33.080 --> 25:36.040\n of axons, these are the outgoing threads\n\n25:36.040 --> 25:39.760\n that connect one part of the brain to another part.\n\n25:39.760 --> 25:41.920\n There's a projection that links, for example,\n\n25:41.920 --> 25:45.720\n auditory cortex where we hear things to reward centers\n\n25:45.720 --> 25:48.360\n where we can feel, where feelings of pleasure\n\n25:48.360 --> 25:50.080\n and reward are initiated.\n\n25:50.080 --> 25:53.440\n And it's been shown that if you have reduced connectivity\n\n25:53.440 --> 25:56.520\n along that dimension, you are less able to enjoy music.\n\n25:56.520 --> 25:58.720\n And so these connections, these projections matter.\n\n25:58.720 --> 26:01.880\n They define how effectively two parts of the brain\n\n26:01.880 --> 26:04.520\n can engage with each other and join together\n\n26:04.520 --> 26:07.760\n to form a joint representation of something.\n\n26:07.760 --> 26:09.360\n So that's one meaning, it's pure neuroscience.\n\n26:09.360 --> 26:11.440\n The word projection is used all the time.\n\n26:11.440 --> 26:13.800\n And it happens to be something that optogenetics,\n\n26:13.800 --> 26:16.040\n a technique that maybe we'll talk about a little later\n\n26:16.040 --> 26:17.200\n that works particularly well with,\n\n26:17.200 --> 26:19.960\n we can use light to turn on or off the activity\n\n26:19.960 --> 26:22.200\n along these projections from one spot of the brain\n\n26:22.200 --> 26:23.040\n to another.\n\n26:23.040 --> 26:24.080\n And this is particularly referring\n\n26:24.080 --> 26:25.840\n to the long range connections.\n\n26:25.840 --> 26:27.360\n It's particularly straightforward\n\n26:27.360 --> 26:28.700\n along these long range projections\n\n26:28.700 --> 26:29.840\n that connect different parts of the brain,\n\n26:29.840 --> 26:32.040\n but it works over shorter range too.\n\n26:32.040 --> 26:34.120\n But then there's this other meaning of projections\n\n26:34.120 --> 26:35.760\n which you were bringing up, which is very relevant,\n\n26:35.760 --> 26:39.040\n which is at some point you can reduce something\n\n26:39.040 --> 26:41.120\n from one level of dimensionality to another,\n\n26:41.120 --> 26:43.280\n and you can project down into a lower dimensional space,\n\n26:43.280 --> 26:44.840\n for example.\n\n26:44.840 --> 26:49.200\n And then finally, there's a psychiatric term projections\n\n26:49.200 --> 26:54.120\n which comes up all the time, which is we very often\n\n26:54.120 --> 26:56.440\n will look at our internal states\n\n26:56.440 --> 26:57.720\n and to understand somebody else,\n\n26:57.720 --> 27:00.520\n we'll project them onto somebody else.\n\n27:00.520 --> 27:02.840\n We'll try to understand someone else's behavior\n\n27:02.840 --> 27:06.440\n and make sense of it by projecting our own inner feelings,\n\n27:06.440 --> 27:10.880\n our own sort of narrative onto them\n\n27:10.880 --> 27:15.040\n and use that as a way to help us understand them better.\n\n27:15.040 --> 27:16.140\n And we'll do the reverse too.\n\n27:16.140 --> 27:18.400\n We'll take things we see in the outside world\n\n27:18.400 --> 27:19.660\n and we'll bring them into ourselves\n\n27:19.660 --> 27:21.480\n and see how well they map, how well they align.\n\n27:21.480 --> 27:23.220\n That's called introjection.\n\n27:23.220 --> 27:25.840\n So projections turns out to be a really rich word.\n\n27:25.840 --> 27:28.320\n And then finally, of course, there's the very common\n\n27:28.320 --> 27:31.940\n sense of it as a projector that illuminates\n\n27:31.940 --> 27:35.920\n by conveying information across space with light.\n\n27:35.920 --> 27:38.280\n So for English, for English language,\n\n27:38.280 --> 27:40.200\n perfect word to use for this book.\n\n27:40.200 --> 27:42.360\n But what's funny is not every,\n\n27:43.260 --> 27:45.000\n there are a lot of international translations now\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:46.760\n and all those rich connotations\n\n27:46.760 --> 27:48.660\n aren't captured in other languages.\n\n27:48.660 --> 27:53.400\n And so for some translations, connections is used\n\n27:53.400 --> 27:54.400\n instead of projections.\n\n27:54.400 --> 27:56.120\n In fact, even in England,\n\n27:56.120 --> 27:58.320\n the British version is connections instead of projections\n\n27:58.320 --> 28:00.040\n because apparently projections\n\n28:00.040 --> 28:02.600\n doesn't have the full connotation, I was told.\n\n28:02.600 --> 28:06.560\n So you have to sacrifice some of the rich ambiguity\n\n28:06.560 --> 28:09.920\n of meaning with connections, that's interesting.\n\n28:09.920 --> 28:12.680\n I mean, connect, man, words are so interesting.\n\n28:12.680 --> 28:14.000\n They have so many meaning.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:16.960\n I love language and how much is lost in translation.\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:19.760\n I'm very fortunate enough to be able to speak.\n\n28:19.760 --> 28:20.760\n I'm not good at languages.\n\n28:20.760 --> 28:24.520\n I was just, I guess, forced to by life's circumstance\n\n28:24.520 --> 28:27.720\n to learn two languages, Russian and English.\n\n28:27.720 --> 28:29.640\n And it's just so interesting to watch\n\n28:29.640 --> 28:31.420\n how much of culture, how much of people,\n\n28:31.420 --> 28:34.280\n how much of history is lost in translation.\n\n28:35.240 --> 28:39.960\n The poetry, the music, the history, the pain,\n\n28:39.960 --> 28:41.880\n the way the scientists actually express themselves,\n\n28:41.880 --> 28:43.000\n which is funny.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:52.000\n I mean, it's so sad to see how much brilliant work\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.440\n that was written in Russian.\n\n28:53.440 --> 28:56.960\n There's a whole culture of science in the Soviet Union\n\n28:56.960 --> 28:58.000\n that is now lost.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:01.120\n It makes me wonder, in the modern day,\n\n29:01.120 --> 29:04.200\n how much incredible science is going on in China\n\n29:05.160 --> 29:07.000\n that is lost in translation.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.040\n And I'll never, I mean, that makes me very sad\n\n29:09.040 --> 29:13.360\n because I'll never learn Chinese in the same way\n\n29:13.360 --> 29:15.800\n that I've learned English and Russian.\n\n29:15.800 --> 29:17.900\n Maybe, whenever I say stuff like that,\n\n29:17.900 --> 29:19.800\n people are like, well, there's still time.\n\n29:19.800 --> 29:23.820\n But, you know, yeah, that's actually fair,\n\n29:23.820 --> 29:28.820\n that I think the 21st century, both China and U.S.\n\n29:29.880 --> 29:33.640\n will have very important roles in the scientific development\n\n29:33.640 --> 29:36.880\n and we should actually bridge the gap through language.\n\n29:36.880 --> 29:39.440\n And that doesn't just mean convincing Chinese\n\n29:39.440 --> 29:40.680\n to speak English.\n\n29:40.680 --> 29:43.240\n That means also learning Chinese.\n\n29:43.240 --> 29:45.440\n Well, we need these bridge people who can do both.\n\n29:45.440 --> 29:50.120\n You know, Nabokov, for example, writing in English\n\n29:50.120 --> 29:53.600\n beautifully, one of my favorite poets, Borges,\n\n29:53.600 --> 29:56.960\n who I mentioned earlier, he wrote both in English\n\n29:56.960 --> 30:00.760\n and in Spanish, I think beautifully in both.\n\n30:00.760 --> 30:03.600\n We need those people who can serve as bridges\n\n30:03.600 --> 30:06.960\n across cultures who really can do both.\n\n30:06.960 --> 30:10.400\n You mentioned Borges, so you open your book\n\n30:10.400 --> 30:14.720\n with a few lines from a poem by Jorge Luis Borges,\n\n30:14.720 --> 30:15.880\n a love poem.\n\n30:15.880 --> 30:18.660\n I'm gonna read parts of it because it's a damn good poem.\n\n30:18.660 --> 30:20.380\n It's called Two English Poems.\n\n30:20.380 --> 30:24.080\n I mean, there's, I'd like to understand why you used it\n\n30:24.080 --> 30:27.480\n and the specific parts you used, which is interesting.\n\n30:27.480 --> 30:30.440\n But then when I read the full thing,\n\n30:30.440 --> 30:35.440\n so I think you used it as a sort of beautiful description\n\n30:36.340 --> 30:39.060\n of what it means to delve deep into understanding,\n\n30:40.080 --> 30:42.440\n offering yourself to the task of understanding\n\n30:42.440 --> 30:43.960\n another human being.\n\n30:43.960 --> 30:46.000\n But if you look at the full context of the poem,\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:49.080\n it's also a damn good description of being hit by love\n\n30:49.080 --> 30:52.760\n and overtaken by it and sort of,\n\n30:52.760 --> 30:56.560\n and trying to figure out how to make sense of the world\n\n30:56.560 --> 30:59.320\n now that you've been stricken by it.\n\n30:59.320 --> 31:03.800\n It says a bunch of things about chatting\n\n31:03.800 --> 31:06.020\n and significantly with friends and all those kinds of things\n\n31:06.020 --> 31:10.600\n and then the poem reads, the big wave brought you.\n\n31:10.600 --> 31:14.160\n I get, this is the moment, I guess, of the universe\n\n31:14.160 --> 31:16.720\n where the two people you fall in love.\n\n31:16.720 --> 31:18.800\n Maybe I'm totally misreading this poem, by the way.\n\n31:18.800 --> 31:20.720\n Doesn't matter, you can't misread a poem.\n\n31:20.720 --> 31:25.720\n So it goes on, words, any words, your laughter,\n\n31:25.880 --> 31:28.900\n and you're so lazily and incessantly beautiful.\n\n31:28.900 --> 31:31.880\n We talked and you have forgotten the words.\n\n31:31.880 --> 31:34.600\n The shattering dawn finds me in a deserted street\n\n31:34.600 --> 31:37.720\n of my city, your profile turned away.\n\n31:37.720 --> 31:40.280\n The sounds that go to make your name.\n\n31:40.280 --> 31:42.120\n The lilt of your laughter.\n\n31:42.120 --> 31:45.240\n These are the illustrious toys you have left me.\n\n31:45.240 --> 31:48.280\n So these little memories of these peculiar little details,\n\n31:48.280 --> 31:51.040\n he remembers, those are the illustrious toys.\n\n31:51.040 --> 31:53.160\n I apologize to mix my own words with the poem,\n\n31:53.160 --> 31:55.640\n but you should definitely read it.\n\n31:55.640 --> 31:58.640\n I turn them over in the dawn, I lose them.\n\n31:58.640 --> 31:59.840\n I find them.\n\n31:59.840 --> 32:01.760\n I tell them to the few stray dogs\n\n32:01.760 --> 32:03.980\n and to the few stray stars of the dawn.\n\n32:05.360 --> 32:09.080\n Your dark, rich life.\n\n32:09.080 --> 32:11.620\n I must get at you somehow.\n\n32:11.620 --> 32:14.500\n I put away those illustrious toys you have left me.\n\n32:14.500 --> 32:18.000\n I want your hidden look, your real smile.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:22.080\n That lonely, mocking smile your cool mirror knows.\n\n32:22.080 --> 32:24.980\n I want your hidden look, your real smile.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.060\n So this is the first part of the poem,\n\n32:28.060 --> 32:30.740\n and then it goes on, which is some of the parts\n\n32:30.740 --> 32:31.940\n that you reference.\n\n32:33.040 --> 32:36.000\n Second part is, what can I hold you with?\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.500\n I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets,\n\n32:38.500 --> 32:40.320\n the moon of the jagged suburbs.\n\n32:40.320 --> 32:42.080\n I offer you the bitterness of a man\n\n32:42.080 --> 32:45.220\n who has looked long and long at a lonely moon.\n\n32:45.220 --> 32:48.440\n I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,\n\n32:48.440 --> 32:51.340\n the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze.\n\n32:51.340 --> 32:55.200\n My father's father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires,\n\n32:55.200 --> 32:57.780\n two bullets through his lungs, and so on, so on.\n\n32:57.780 --> 33:00.480\n I offer you whatever insights my books may hold,\n\n33:00.480 --> 33:02.580\n whatever manliness or humor in my life.\n\n33:02.580 --> 33:05.800\n I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.\n\n33:05.800 --> 33:08.040\n I offer you that carnival of myself\n\n33:08.040 --> 33:10.080\n that I have saved somehow, the central heart\n\n33:10.080 --> 33:14.120\n that deals not in words, traffics, not with dreams,\n\n33:14.120 --> 33:18.560\n and is untouched by time, my joy, and adversities.\n\n33:18.560 --> 33:22.080\n And I think this is the part that you include in the book.\n\n33:22.080 --> 33:25.600\n I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset,\n\n33:25.600 --> 33:30.600\n years before you were born, I, damn, that's a good line.\n\n33:30.680 --> 33:35.280\n Okay, I offer you explanations of yourself,\n\n33:35.280 --> 33:36.520\n theories about yourself,\n\n33:36.520 --> 33:39.080\n authentic and surprising news of yourself.\n\n33:39.080 --> 33:42.000\n I can give you my loneliness, my darkness,\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.560\n the hunger of my heart.\n\n33:43.560 --> 33:45.640\n I'm trying to bribe you with uncertainty,\n\n33:45.640 --> 33:47.720\n with danger, with defeat.\n\n33:47.720 --> 33:49.980\n That is a man who's in love and longing.\n\n33:49.980 --> 33:52.960\n If I've taken, but I just wanna go back to,\n\n33:52.960 --> 33:55.120\n maybe you could say why you wanted to include that poem,\n\n33:55.120 --> 34:00.080\n but also your dark, rich life, I must get at you somehow.\n\n34:00.080 --> 34:03.440\n I put away those illustrious toys you have left me at.\n\n34:03.440 --> 34:06.080\n I want your hidden look, your real smile,\n\n34:06.080 --> 34:09.040\n that lonely, mocking smile, your cool mirror nose.\n\n34:09.040 --> 34:12.100\n Sometimes I meet a stranger, and I just,\n\n34:13.320 --> 34:15.920\n it's like a double take.\n\n34:15.920 --> 34:17.820\n It's like, who are you?\n\n34:17.820 --> 34:19.480\n Have we met before somewhere?\n\n34:19.480 --> 34:22.320\n Who's that person behind there?\n\n34:22.320 --> 34:25.000\n And I wanna get at that, whatever that is.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\n And of course, maybe that's what love is,\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:30.200\n because maybe that's the whole pursuit,\n\n34:30.200 --> 34:32.360\n like a lifelong pursuit of getting at that person.\n\n34:32.360 --> 34:33.640\n Maybe that's what that is,\n\n34:33.640 --> 34:37.960\n and like that insatiable sort of curiosity to keep getting.\n\n34:37.960 --> 34:40.400\n Like, well, who is that person in your own private life?\n\n34:40.400 --> 34:42.680\n Yeah, so that, absolutely, I think that,\n\n34:42.680 --> 34:44.900\n it was a beautiful description of what you just said,\n\n34:44.900 --> 34:46.840\n when there's that first moment,\n\n34:46.840 --> 34:48.880\n and then you wanna dive deeper.\n\n34:48.880 --> 34:52.160\n You want to know what the hidden mysteries are.\n\n34:52.160 --> 34:55.280\n In a way, it's a love poem.\n\n34:55.280 --> 34:57.540\n As a scientist, though, it also,\n\n34:58.480 --> 35:01.120\n it's a bit of how a scientist can love science,\n\n35:01.120 --> 35:06.120\n and that wanting to dive deeper is,\n\n35:07.560 --> 35:09.760\n it's almost like, again, where the,\n\n35:09.760 --> 35:10.840\n it could be a love affair\n\n35:10.840 --> 35:13.320\n with investigating the human mind, for example.\n\n35:13.320 --> 35:16.600\n And that was one reason it spoke to me also.\n\n35:16.600 --> 35:19.160\n Again, thinking about the broader sweep\n\n35:19.160 --> 35:20.860\n of where the human mind came from,\n\n35:20.860 --> 35:25.020\n and the steps it took to get where it is today,\n\n35:25.020 --> 35:26.940\n what was given up along the way,\n\n35:26.940 --> 35:28.180\n what compromises were made.\n\n35:28.180 --> 35:29.780\n And here's where the darkness of the poem\n\n35:29.780 --> 35:31.500\n starts to come in a little bit, too.\n\n35:31.500 --> 35:35.060\n It doesn't shy away from the negativity,\n\n35:35.060 --> 35:39.100\n from the confusion, from the danger.\n\n35:39.100 --> 35:40.340\n And then at the very end,\n\n35:42.120 --> 35:46.540\n the boardface is offering up scenes from his life,\n\n35:46.540 --> 35:49.540\n parts of himself, and this is how we connect with people.\n\n35:49.540 --> 35:51.940\n We offer up parts of ourselves, just here it is,\n\n35:51.940 --> 35:54.640\n and then we see how well does that map onto what you have.\n\n35:54.640 --> 35:57.780\n And it's that offering up that I liked,\n\n35:57.780 --> 36:00.380\n and not the good stuff, or not only the good stuff.\n\n36:00.380 --> 36:01.380\n The yellow rose is nice,\n\n36:01.380 --> 36:03.660\n but he's offering up the bad stuff, too.\n\n36:03.660 --> 36:06.260\n And that, to me, was important for the book,\n\n36:06.260 --> 36:10.000\n because I'm offering up hard stuff, too.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.220\n In fact, a lot of it.\n\n36:11.220 --> 36:13.420\n And also, hard stuff from within me,\n\n36:13.420 --> 36:15.080\n from my own personal side, too.\n\n36:15.080 --> 36:17.460\n And that was, there's a lot of vulnerability\n\n36:17.460 --> 36:20.180\n that comes with that, but that comes with love,\n\n36:20.180 --> 36:21.300\n that comes with writing.\n\n36:21.300 --> 36:23.540\n You have to be open, you have to be vulnerable.\n\n36:23.540 --> 36:28.180\n And so, I thought that reflected what I was trying to do,\n\n36:28.180 --> 36:29.740\n and I thought it was, as an epigraph,\n\n36:29.740 --> 36:33.740\n it kind of made it clear how vulnerable I was\n\n36:33.740 --> 36:38.260\n in taking this step, but also what could come out of it.\n\n36:38.260 --> 36:39.620\n And also, in a meta way,\n\n36:39.620 --> 36:41.820\n because I was not familiar with this poem,\n\n36:41.820 --> 36:46.820\n it made me curious of the poem itself\n\n36:47.620 --> 36:51.260\n to pull at that thread of finding out more.\n\n36:51.260 --> 36:53.300\n You picked a very particular part\n\n36:53.300 --> 36:57.660\n that kind of made you want to pull at that thread,\n\n36:57.660 --> 37:02.660\n and see where did these few lines come from?\n\n37:02.940 --> 37:05.780\n Because I read it as a curiosity of a scientist,\n\n37:05.780 --> 37:08.380\n those lines alone.\n\n37:08.380 --> 37:13.300\n And also, as a desperate human being,\n\n37:13.300 --> 37:17.340\n searching, like offering himself for an understanding,\n\n37:17.340 --> 37:19.500\n or connection with another human being.\n\n37:19.500 --> 37:21.980\n And then, because I wasn't sure if it's a love poem or not,\n\n37:21.980 --> 37:23.700\n or if it's desperation, or if it's curiosity,\n\n37:23.700 --> 37:26.220\n whatever it is, and then you see the love poem.\n\n37:26.220 --> 37:28.300\n I mean, I don't know, that's gonna stick with me\n\n37:28.300 --> 37:32.180\n for a while, your dark, rich life.\n\n37:32.180 --> 37:35.340\n And then a few lines in here are just,\n\n37:35.340 --> 37:38.500\n I mean, those are, I'm gonna just use them\n\n37:38.500 --> 37:40.260\n as pickup lines at a bar.\n\n37:40.260 --> 37:42.420\n I offer you the memory of a yellow rose\n\n37:42.420 --> 37:44.900\n seen at sunset years before you were born.\n\n37:47.380 --> 37:48.900\n No, that's a pickup line I've never heard,\n\n37:48.900 --> 37:51.460\n if I've ever heard one, anyway, sorry.\n\n37:51.460 --> 37:52.300\n But this is universal.\n\n37:52.300 --> 37:55.500\n You see it in so many forms of art.\n\n37:55.500 --> 37:57.340\n Like, we're in Texas now,\n\n37:57.340 --> 38:00.020\n you see this in country and western songs.\n\n38:00.020 --> 38:02.100\n It's often a list of things.\n\n38:02.100 --> 38:03.620\n Like, here's how I describe myself.\n\n38:03.620 --> 38:04.460\n There's this, and there's that,\n\n38:04.460 --> 38:06.300\n and there's the other thing, and here you are.\n\n38:06.300 --> 38:07.900\n These things matter to me,\n\n38:07.900 --> 38:09.260\n and I hope they matter to you, too.\n\n38:09.260 --> 38:11.060\n It's a pretty universal form,\n\n38:11.060 --> 38:13.780\n but he did it in this very artful\n\n38:14.700 --> 38:16.780\n and very vulnerable way.\n\n38:16.780 --> 38:20.580\n It was both beautiful, and you could feel the hurt\n\n38:20.580 --> 38:22.960\n coming from him, too, and that was important.\n\n38:22.960 --> 38:24.300\n The dark stuff, too.\n\n38:24.300 --> 38:26.820\n I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,\n\n38:26.820 --> 38:29.460\n the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze,\n\n38:29.460 --> 38:32.300\n and talking about two bullets through his lungs,\n\n38:32.300 --> 38:36.620\n bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers\n\n38:36.620 --> 38:37.980\n in the hide of a cow,\n\n38:37.980 --> 38:40.320\n a mother's grandfather just 24,\n\n38:40.320 --> 38:43.620\n heading a charge of 300 men in Peru,\n\n38:43.620 --> 38:46.980\n now ghosts on vanished horses.\n\n38:46.980 --> 38:49.080\n So all of it, the whole history of it.\n\n38:50.320 --> 38:53.900\n Since it is a love poem, what do you think about love?\n\n38:55.100 --> 38:58.620\n Carl, what's the role of love in the human condition?\n\n38:58.620 --> 39:00.660\n We'll talk about the dark stuff.\n\n39:00.660 --> 39:02.940\n But maybe love is the dark stuff, too.\n\n39:02.940 --> 39:06.980\n I mean, it's the most powerful connection we can form,\n\n39:06.980 --> 39:11.280\n and that's what makes it so important to us.\n\n39:11.280 --> 39:16.280\n It's the strongest and most stable connection\n\n39:16.300 --> 39:17.700\n that we can form with another person,\n\n39:17.700 --> 39:19.900\n and that matters immensely.\n\n39:19.900 --> 39:24.420\n It matters for the human family to have evolved\n\n39:24.420 --> 39:27.220\n to be something that could survive against the odds\n\n39:27.220 --> 39:29.740\n that we've faced over the years.\n\n39:29.740 --> 39:34.740\n That unreasonable bond that becomes reasonable\n\n39:35.580 --> 39:37.740\n by virtue of its own existence.\n\n39:38.580 --> 39:43.580\n And of course, that joy, the wild, raw joy of love,\n\n39:45.060 --> 39:46.660\n is not a bad thing, either.\n\n39:46.660 --> 39:48.540\n So you put these together,\n\n39:48.540 --> 39:50.660\n the strongest bridge we can form,\n\n39:51.580 --> 39:54.340\n and the reward and the joy that it brings.\n\n39:54.340 --> 39:56.820\n That's what love is to me,\n\n39:56.820 --> 40:01.360\n and from my perspective, this is something that,\n\n40:02.740 --> 40:05.040\n it can be hard to capture fairly,\n\n40:05.040 --> 40:07.220\n because you wanna talk about the positive\n\n40:07.220 --> 40:09.100\n and the negative sides at once.\n\n40:09.100 --> 40:10.360\n They need to be wrapped up together\n\n40:10.360 --> 40:13.700\n for a full, honest description of what it is,\n\n40:13.700 --> 40:16.660\n and that's hard to do in a compact form.\n\n40:16.660 --> 40:19.380\n And so you have to take time to talk about love.\n\n40:19.380 --> 40:23.580\n You have to take time to do it justice.\n\n40:23.580 --> 40:25.500\n It takes a book, or at least a poem.\n\n40:25.500 --> 40:28.420\n Or several thousands of them.\n\n40:28.420 --> 40:30.620\n I don't know, could you pull up,\n\n40:30.620 --> 40:33.980\n there's a video I saw, yeah, like right here.\n\n40:33.980 --> 40:35.500\n So can you pause for a second?\n\n40:37.380 --> 40:39.220\n So there's March of the Penguins.\n\n40:39.220 --> 40:44.140\n So you always see penguins huddling together against,\n\n40:44.140 --> 40:46.340\n I mean, sorry if I say just metaphors and everything,\n\n40:46.340 --> 40:49.940\n but them huddling together against the harshness\n\n40:50.820 --> 40:52.180\n of the conditions around them.\n\n40:52.180 --> 40:55.680\n That's very kind of, that's like a metaphor for life,\n\n40:55.680 --> 40:57.500\n like finding this connection.\n\n40:57.500 --> 40:59.220\n That's kind of what love is.\n\n40:59.220 --> 41:02.140\n It's like it allows you to forget whatever the absurdity,\n\n41:02.140 --> 41:03.740\n whatever the suffering of life is,\n\n41:03.740 --> 41:06.720\n together you get to like huddle for warmth.\n\n41:06.720 --> 41:11.500\n And that's why I love sort of just the honesty\n\n41:11.500 --> 41:13.100\n and the intensity of the way penguins,\n\n41:13.100 --> 41:15.180\n just in the middle of like the cold do this.\n\n41:15.180 --> 41:18.900\n And then this video I saw, a lonely,\n\n41:18.900 --> 41:20.940\n this is misinformation.\n\n41:20.940 --> 41:23.900\n So the name of the video is Lonely Deranged Penguin.\n\n41:23.900 --> 41:26.060\n I don't know if he's deranged.\n\n41:26.060 --> 41:27.740\n So if you play it.\n\n41:27.740 --> 41:32.740\n So he left his pack and there's a nice like voiceover\n\n41:34.540 --> 41:36.040\n and you don't need to play it,\n\n41:36.040 --> 41:38.940\n but he for some reason left the pack\n\n41:38.940 --> 41:41.820\n and journeyed out into the mountains.\n\n41:41.820 --> 41:44.740\n And so the narrator says that he's deranged,\n\n41:44.740 --> 41:46.500\n he's lost his mind.\n\n41:46.500 --> 41:50.700\n Now I'd like to project the idea that he's actually,\n\n41:50.700 --> 41:52.940\n there's so many stories you could think of.\n\n41:52.940 --> 41:55.100\n He's returning to his homeland.\n\n41:55.100 --> 41:56.740\n He's an outsider thinking,\n\n41:56.740 --> 41:58.340\n journeying out into the unknown,\n\n41:58.340 --> 42:00.180\n thinking he may be able to discover\n\n42:00.180 --> 42:02.100\n something greater than the tribe.\n\n42:02.100 --> 42:04.640\n He might be looking for a lost love.\n\n42:04.640 --> 42:06.660\n Why is he deranged immediately?\n\n42:06.660 --> 42:07.980\n Why has he lost his mind?\n\n42:07.980 --> 42:10.980\n Anyway, but this, people should look up this video\n\n42:10.980 --> 42:12.940\n because to me, I might be the only one\n\n42:12.940 --> 42:17.940\n who romanticizes this, but it's such a nice kind of,\n\n42:17.940 --> 42:21.820\n it's both a picture of perhaps a mental disorder,\n\n42:21.820 --> 42:23.900\n which is what the video kind of describes.\n\n42:23.900 --> 42:25.900\n And it may be some deeper explanation\n\n42:25.900 --> 42:30.900\n that's not, that has to do with the motivation of a mind.\n\n42:32.620 --> 42:35.500\n But yeah, I don't know if you have a deeper analysis\n\n42:35.500 --> 42:36.340\n on this penguin.\n\n42:36.340 --> 42:39.140\n Well, I, like you as a psychiatrist,\n\n42:40.100 --> 42:43.640\n I would want to sit down with a penguin and go through,\n\n42:44.600 --> 42:47.680\n I want to see the notes from his prior therapist.\n\n42:47.680 --> 42:51.620\n But this actually is relevant,\n\n42:51.620 --> 42:54.620\n not knowing what was that penguin's motivation.\n\n42:54.620 --> 42:57.740\n We have very clear situations\n\n42:57.740 --> 42:59.620\n where there are both within an individual,\n\n42:59.620 --> 43:03.700\n we go through periods of time when we stay in one place\n\n43:03.700 --> 43:06.580\n and we reap the benefits from what we've built.\n\n43:06.580 --> 43:11.300\n And then we go through periods of foraging, of wandering.\n\n43:11.300 --> 43:15.180\n Even if there may be resources where we are,\n\n43:15.180 --> 43:17.700\n we have periods of time in our lives\n\n43:17.700 --> 43:22.700\n where we wander, where we go in an exploratory mode.\n\n43:22.700 --> 43:26.500\n And different people express that trait in different ways.\n\n43:26.500 --> 43:27.860\n This is not a human specific trait.\n\n43:27.860 --> 43:31.540\n If you go down to the tiny little nematode worm,\n\n43:31.540 --> 43:34.740\n C. elegans with 302 nervous system cells,\n\n43:34.740 --> 43:37.180\n they go through these phases of foraging and rest\n\n43:37.180 --> 43:39.540\n and different individuals have different propensity\n\n43:39.540 --> 43:42.900\n to forage or to rest and stay in one place.\n\n43:42.900 --> 43:45.540\n At the level of the species, that's really good\n\n43:45.540 --> 43:50.540\n that there's that diversity in their willingness to forage.\n\n43:51.060 --> 43:52.980\n Some stay where they are,\n\n43:52.980 --> 43:56.660\n the species is somewhat on a firm footing then,\n\n43:56.660 --> 44:00.340\n but some carry a burden, a risk for themselves,\n\n44:00.340 --> 44:03.340\n but it's good for the species that they're explorers\n\n44:03.340 --> 44:04.640\n and they will venture out.\n\n44:05.500 --> 44:09.180\n The migration patterns that different species blunder into\n\n44:09.180 --> 44:10.760\n and that turned out to be really good,\n\n44:10.760 --> 44:13.300\n they weren't logically derived.\n\n44:13.300 --> 44:15.260\n They most certainly started\n\n44:15.260 --> 44:18.220\n from something like this, an exploration.\n\n44:18.220 --> 44:19.340\n And humans do this too, you think?\n\n44:19.340 --> 44:20.460\n And we do it too.\n\n44:20.460 --> 44:23.860\n In fact, it's something we do extremely well.\n\n44:23.860 --> 44:25.940\n Let's talk about psychiatry a little bit.\n\n44:28.900 --> 44:30.940\n So in my book, you're a rockstar.\n\n44:30.940 --> 44:33.100\n First of all, for people who don't know,\n\n44:33.100 --> 44:38.100\n aside from sort of the neurological view of the brain\n\n44:38.320 --> 44:40.200\n and neuroscience view of the brain,\n\n44:40.200 --> 44:43.200\n you're also one of the great psychiatrists of our time.\n\n44:43.200 --> 44:45.780\n I've always, not always, but when I was younger,\n\n44:45.780 --> 44:47.680\n I dreamed about being a psychiatrist.\n\n44:49.860 --> 44:53.380\n So it's like getting to meet your heroes\n\n44:53.380 --> 44:57.480\n and also getting to meet the people who,\n\n44:59.020 --> 45:01.500\n the best at the top of the world\n\n45:01.500 --> 45:03.580\n at the thing you've failed to pursue.\n\n45:03.580 --> 45:07.220\n So I'm getting a free therapy session on top of that.\n\n45:07.220 --> 45:11.460\n Okay, so what big picture, what is the practice,\n\n45:11.460 --> 45:13.860\n the goal, the hope of modern psychiatry?\n\n45:13.860 --> 45:17.380\n If you could try to describe the discipline\n\n45:17.380 --> 45:20.700\n as you see it, maybe historically\n\n45:20.700 --> 45:23.060\n throughout the 20th century,\n\n45:23.060 --> 45:25.500\n in contrasting to what it is today.\n\n45:25.500 --> 45:27.460\n Or maybe if you want to describe\n\n45:27.460 --> 45:29.580\n to what you hope psychiatry becomes\n\n45:29.580 --> 45:32.720\n or longs to become in the 21st century.\n\n45:34.180 --> 45:36.340\n It's been an interesting journey.\n\n45:36.340 --> 45:39.380\n Psychiatry started out pretty firmly grounded\n\n45:39.380 --> 45:40.980\n in neurology and pathology.\n\n45:40.980 --> 45:44.260\n Some of the initial founders effectively of the field\n\n45:44.260 --> 45:48.220\n were very well grounded in microscopy, looking at cells,\n\n45:49.580 --> 45:52.540\n working with patients, particularly on the neurological side,\n\n45:52.540 --> 45:54.460\n and this certainly included Freud\n\n45:54.460 --> 45:56.060\n and some of his contemporaries.\n\n45:58.340 --> 46:03.100\n But they rapidly discovered that what they could work with\n\n46:03.100 --> 46:05.700\n at the level of cells and microscopy\n\n46:05.700 --> 46:09.620\n was so far from the realm of what they could get\n\n46:09.620 --> 46:12.380\n from a human being and what they were getting\n\n46:12.380 --> 46:14.660\n from the human being was so much more interesting\n\n46:14.660 --> 46:17.260\n and was so mysterious and so unknown\n\n46:17.260 --> 46:18.880\n that many of them just said,\n\n46:18.880 --> 46:20.180\n we're gonna inhabit this domain\n\n46:20.180 --> 46:23.220\n and we're gonna work with the people with their words\n\n46:23.220 --> 46:27.060\n and understand what we can based on verbal communication,\n\n46:27.060 --> 46:30.520\n because that was the only tool that people really had.\n\n46:30.520 --> 46:35.520\n And that was a very important step for the field.\n\n46:37.220 --> 46:39.180\n I would say one of the interesting things\n\n46:39.180 --> 46:42.620\n that came from the early decades of psychiatry\n\n46:42.620 --> 46:44.020\n really was this distinction\n\n46:44.020 --> 46:47.220\n between the conscious and the unconscious mind\n\n46:47.220 --> 46:51.440\n and paying particular attention to the unconscious mind\n\n46:51.440 --> 46:54.020\n as something that was worthy of consideration\n\n46:54.020 --> 46:58.620\n that might be important in explaining people's actions\n\n46:58.620 --> 47:01.140\n and that perhaps even insight into that was valuable\n\n47:01.140 --> 47:02.620\n in its own right.\n\n47:02.620 --> 47:07.580\n And out of that, psychoanalysis became a practice\n\n47:07.580 --> 47:12.580\n that was not always focused on cures or treatments,\n\n47:12.840 --> 47:14.220\n but was more focused on insight.\n\n47:14.220 --> 47:15.380\n What does it mean?\n\n47:15.380 --> 47:17.340\n How can we help people understand\n\n47:17.340 --> 47:19.900\n why they're feeling something or thinking something\n\n47:19.900 --> 47:21.180\n or dreaming something?\n\n47:22.260 --> 47:24.700\n And that insight separate even from treatment\n\n47:24.700 --> 47:26.540\n was an interesting thing.\n\n47:26.540 --> 47:28.940\n As long as one was honest about that\n\n47:28.940 --> 47:31.160\n and said we're going for understanding,\n\n47:31.160 --> 47:32.400\n we're going for insight.\n\n47:32.400 --> 47:34.820\n Maybe it's useful to just pause on that.\n\n47:34.820 --> 47:39.080\n If we look at the father of psychoanalysis, Zygmunt Freud,\n\n47:40.780 --> 47:43.340\n what do you make of the ideas that he had?\n\n47:43.340 --> 47:46.860\n So you mentioned taking the unconscious,\n\n47:46.860 --> 47:49.380\n the subconscious seriously.\n\n47:49.380 --> 47:50.900\n That's like step one,\n\n47:50.900 --> 47:52.220\n like that there could be worlds\n\n47:52.220 --> 47:53.900\n we do not have direct access for\n\n47:53.900 --> 47:57.820\n and we probe at them through conversation\n\n47:57.820 --> 48:00.900\n or is that too simplistic\n\n48:00.900 --> 48:03.100\n to call psychoanalysis conversation?\n\n48:03.100 --> 48:05.220\n That's not too simplistic, but that's right.\n\n48:05.220 --> 48:06.660\n And I think that was valuable.\n\n48:06.660 --> 48:09.040\n Where Freud ended up breaking\n\n48:09.040 --> 48:10.300\n from some of his contemporaries,\n\n48:10.300 --> 48:13.300\n he was very focused on this unconscious\n\n48:13.300 --> 48:15.700\n as being so tightly linked to libido.\n\n48:15.700 --> 48:18.860\n And really from his perspective,\n\n48:18.860 --> 48:20.820\n you couldn't really separate the operation\n\n48:20.820 --> 48:22.720\n of the unconscious mind from these aspects\n\n48:22.720 --> 48:24.180\n of the libidinous aspects.\n\n48:24.180 --> 48:25.020\n And that was one reason.\n\n48:25.020 --> 48:25.860\n What's a libidinous aspect?\n\n48:25.860 --> 48:29.140\n You know, sexually related drives.\n\n48:29.140 --> 48:33.100\n Carl Jung, who was his contemporary,\n\n48:33.100 --> 48:36.220\n that's one factor that led to them separating\n\n48:36.220 --> 48:39.540\n was Carl Jung felt there was a lot more\n\n48:39.540 --> 48:42.700\n to the unconscious than this libidinous aspect of it.\n\n48:42.700 --> 48:45.820\n And he saw it as a much more complete\n\n48:47.500 --> 48:50.900\n alternate representation of the conscious self,\n\n48:50.900 --> 48:53.460\n one that maybe reflected a whole range\n\n48:53.460 --> 48:58.360\n of different motivations and desires.\n\n49:00.020 --> 49:04.780\n And to properly treat it one had to consider all of them\n\n49:04.780 --> 49:06.420\n rather than the ones that Freud was focused on.\n\n49:06.420 --> 49:08.340\n Carl Jung, shut your mouth.\n\n49:08.340 --> 49:09.780\n Thank you.\n\n49:09.780 --> 49:13.300\n Thank you for the high level of images\n\n49:13.300 --> 49:14.340\n that Sergei's pulling up.\n\n49:14.340 --> 49:15.500\n For people who are just listening,\n\n49:15.500 --> 49:19.860\n he pulled up a quote from Sigmund Freud's meme,\n\n49:19.860 --> 49:22.540\n your mom quote Freud.\n\n49:23.380 --> 49:28.380\n So the shadow, the Carl Jung shadow encompasses everything,\n\n49:28.780 --> 49:31.260\n not just the desire to have sex with your mother\n\n49:31.260 --> 49:32.580\n or sex period.\n\n49:32.580 --> 49:34.320\n That's right, that's right.\n\n49:34.320 --> 49:38.100\n If you look at those two folks en masse,\n\n49:38.100 --> 49:39.980\n I mean, there's a kind of,\n\n49:39.980 --> 49:44.140\n it's almost like a technique for philosophical exploration\n\n49:44.140 --> 49:47.320\n of human mind, human motivations.\n\n49:47.320 --> 49:49.980\n So it's not even like necessarily,\n\n49:49.980 --> 49:53.720\n it's also doubles as a methodology for helping people,\n\n49:53.720 --> 49:54.980\n but it's almost like a,\n\n49:56.420 --> 49:59.940\n it's a kind of philosophical method.\n\n49:59.940 --> 50:03.740\n Right, this is the fascinating thing about psychoanalysis.\n\n50:03.740 --> 50:06.860\n And even though it's, I would say,\n\n50:06.860 --> 50:10.340\n mostly not considered a treatment today,\n\n50:10.340 --> 50:11.740\n it persists for a couple of reasons.\n\n50:11.740 --> 50:15.820\n One is it's thought that it gives people some insight.\n\n50:15.820 --> 50:19.940\n But second, there's been a huge influence on literature,\n\n50:19.940 --> 50:22.060\n on philosophy, on art.\n\n50:22.060 --> 50:24.500\n And the opening up of discussion\n\n50:24.500 --> 50:27.580\n about what was below our conscious mind\n\n50:27.580 --> 50:31.700\n was so fertile in the implications\n\n50:31.700 --> 50:34.700\n that it sort of reverberated and still does\n\n50:34.700 --> 50:37.100\n throughout all these different realms of human endeavor\n\n50:37.100 --> 50:42.100\n from different artistic experiences that people have\n\n50:42.100 --> 50:47.100\n that can be colored by this concept of the unconscious.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:51.760\n Now, the other thing that was interesting\n\n50:51.760 --> 50:54.100\n is this distinction,\n\n50:55.320 --> 50:57.760\n you know, what are the parts of the unconscious?\n\n50:57.760 --> 51:00.680\n And so there were these id and ego\n\n51:00.680 --> 51:04.040\n and superego subdivisions that,\n\n51:05.920 --> 51:09.120\n you know, that Freud, for example, would talk about them.\n\n51:09.120 --> 51:13.080\n And the id was the primary, the primal drives\n\n51:13.080 --> 51:16.480\n that an infant would have or that a very young child\n\n51:16.480 --> 51:19.840\n just warmth and feeding and then later\n\n51:19.840 --> 51:22.520\n the sexual or libidinous aspects.\n\n51:22.520 --> 51:25.160\n And for Freud, the later happened very quickly.\n\n51:25.160 --> 51:29.400\n That's the controversial thing about him, I think.\n\n51:29.400 --> 51:32.520\n I guess he thought like even children had sexual desires,\n\n51:32.520 --> 51:35.120\n that they're like dealing with, contending with.\n\n51:35.120 --> 51:36.360\n So it's the full thing.\n\n51:36.360 --> 51:38.640\n Hungry, wanting to eat, wanting to poop,\n\n51:38.640 --> 51:39.920\n wanting to have sex.\n\n51:39.920 --> 51:43.680\n Yeah, and he was extremely focused on that aspect.\n\n51:43.680 --> 51:46.280\n But then there was the superego,\n\n51:46.280 --> 51:49.120\n which brought on these later sort of moralistic\n\n51:51.080 --> 51:52.840\n sort of codes of conduct.\n\n51:52.840 --> 51:56.200\n And that, of course, was very often in tension,\n\n51:56.200 --> 51:58.560\n but all this could play out subconsciously.\n\n51:58.560 --> 52:01.800\n And then the ego, this third aspect was mediating,\n\n52:01.800 --> 52:04.680\n and Freud's conception mediated this tension\n\n52:04.680 --> 52:06.300\n between the different parts.\n\n52:06.300 --> 52:08.500\n Now, I think that's interesting.\n\n52:08.500 --> 52:13.500\n I will say that in some ways, it's maybe unnecessary\n\n52:14.380 --> 52:16.260\n from the perspective of modern neuroscience\n\n52:16.260 --> 52:21.260\n to divide things up that way from the moralistic drives\n\n52:23.100 --> 52:27.300\n and the primal gratification drives.\n\n52:27.300 --> 52:29.260\n In some ways, they're all drives,\n\n52:29.260 --> 52:31.660\n and maybe they're even all primal drives.\n\n52:31.660 --> 52:34.540\n The moralistic drives, they're taught,\n\n52:34.540 --> 52:37.900\n and they're taught in ways that ultimately relate\n\n52:37.900 --> 52:42.340\n back to survival, and you could even say,\n\n52:42.340 --> 52:46.260\n selfish aspects of health and life\n\n52:46.260 --> 52:47.540\n for the self and family.\n\n52:47.540 --> 52:52.540\n And so this is, I think it's maybe an artificial distinction.\n\n52:53.500 --> 52:56.300\n The concept of the unconscious is very valuable\n\n52:56.300 --> 52:59.820\n and very interesting, but these categorizations\n\n52:59.820 --> 53:04.820\n of id and superego may not map onto neurobiology\n\n53:05.900 --> 53:07.300\n in any particular way.\n\n53:07.300 --> 53:10.540\n If there's a town hall of competing drives and desires,\n\n53:10.540 --> 53:13.700\n and they interrelate to each other,\n\n53:13.700 --> 53:16.060\n they involve different aspects of the brain\n\n53:16.060 --> 53:18.740\n and the history of the person,\n\n53:18.740 --> 53:22.140\n and actions and choices come out of the result\n\n53:22.140 --> 53:25.420\n of that overall shouting in the town hall.\n\n53:25.420 --> 53:27.940\n So in some sense, Carl Jung was a step into the direction\n\n53:27.940 --> 53:32.300\n of liberating yourself from such harsh categorizations.\n\n53:32.300 --> 53:35.260\n Do you think, I mean, you have Daniel Kahneman\n\n53:35.260 --> 53:37.420\n with System One and System Two.\n\n53:37.420 --> 53:40.500\n There's just these very compelling categorizations\n\n53:40.500 --> 53:44.180\n of the human mind that seem to be sticky\n\n53:46.940 --> 53:51.300\n in the superego, no, in how we talk about these ideas\n\n53:51.300 --> 53:52.740\n and so on.\n\n53:52.740 --> 53:55.500\n Do you think those are helpful or do they get in the way?\n\n53:55.500 --> 53:57.900\n Is it some kind of balance in terms of deeper understanding\n\n53:57.900 --> 53:59.380\n of how the mind actually works?\n\n53:59.380 --> 54:01.700\n You know, it's from modern neuroscience,\n\n54:02.940 --> 54:07.940\n whenever we seem to get closer to addressing a question\n\n54:08.220 --> 54:10.020\n like this at the level of cells,\n\n54:10.900 --> 54:12.340\n it seems to get farther away.\n\n54:12.340 --> 54:14.780\n And I'll give you an example of what I mean by that.\n\n54:14.780 --> 54:16.820\n So one thing I'm doing in my laboratory\n\n54:16.820 --> 54:20.740\n and many people are doing is we are listening in\n\n54:20.740 --> 54:24.420\n on the activity of cells, neurons in the brain\n\n54:24.420 --> 54:27.700\n of mice or rats or fish or monkeys.\n\n54:27.700 --> 54:28.540\n Individual cells.\n\n54:28.540 --> 54:29.940\n Individual cells, exactly.\n\n54:29.940 --> 54:33.220\n Of which there are, in our brain, many billions.\n\n54:33.220 --> 54:37.260\n And when we do and we try to predict\n\n54:37.260 --> 54:39.300\n what action will be taken by an animal\n\n54:40.500 --> 54:43.660\n to address this question, where does the choice arise?\n\n54:43.660 --> 54:47.060\n Where does the impetus to make a particular selection\n\n54:47.060 --> 54:48.780\n of one action versus another action,\n\n54:48.780 --> 54:50.060\n where does that start in the brain?\n\n54:50.060 --> 54:52.940\n If you're recording, listening in on the activity of cells\n\n54:52.940 --> 54:56.660\n all across the brain, where's the earliest spot\n\n54:56.660 --> 55:00.620\n you can pick up a choice being made?\n\n55:00.620 --> 55:01.460\n Well?\n\n55:01.460 --> 55:02.300\n That's so awesome.\n\n55:02.300 --> 55:04.180\n Yeah, at one level, you might think,\n\n55:04.180 --> 55:07.340\n how excited would Jung have been to see this\n\n55:07.340 --> 55:10.340\n or Freud or the early psychoanalyst\n\n55:10.340 --> 55:11.620\n to see where this starts.\n\n55:12.500 --> 55:15.820\n But it's not so simple because an emerging theme\n\n55:15.820 --> 55:17.140\n in very recent neuroscience,\n\n55:17.140 --> 55:19.620\n literally over the last few years,\n\n55:19.620 --> 55:23.220\n is that things sort of all start together\n\n55:23.220 --> 55:24.380\n all across the brain.\n\n55:24.380 --> 55:27.060\n And so you can be recording from the cortex,\n\n55:27.060 --> 55:29.900\n this rim of cells at the surface of the brain,\n\n55:29.900 --> 55:31.860\n or you can be recording deeper\n\n55:31.860 --> 55:33.220\n in a structure called the striatum,\n\n55:33.220 --> 55:34.940\n which is a little older.\n\n55:34.940 --> 55:38.380\n It's more tightly linked to action.\n\n55:38.380 --> 55:40.300\n And then structures called the thalamus,\n\n55:40.300 --> 55:41.660\n other parts of the brain.\n\n55:41.660 --> 55:43.020\n And if you record from these,\n\n55:43.020 --> 55:48.020\n these all sort of represent the action and the choice\n\n55:48.820 --> 55:51.300\n more or less all at about the same time, very close.\n\n55:51.300 --> 55:56.020\n And so you can't point to a particular spot and say,\n\n55:56.020 --> 55:59.180\n here's where the choice or the action originates.\n\n55:59.180 --> 56:00.620\n It's a group.\n\n56:00.620 --> 56:02.620\n Finding the free will neuron.\n\n56:03.820 --> 56:05.140\n It's relevant to that question.\n\n56:05.140 --> 56:08.100\n Nobody is close to being able to point to such a thing.\n\n56:08.100 --> 56:11.820\n Well, close is a relative term.\n\n56:11.820 --> 56:16.180\n And nobody, what I tweet today,\n\n56:16.180 --> 56:17.860\n all generalizations are wrong.\n\n56:19.820 --> 56:21.180\n So including this one.\n\n56:21.180 --> 56:22.260\n Let's actually talk about that.\n\n56:22.260 --> 56:25.300\n So the study of individual cells.\n\n56:25.300 --> 56:27.900\n If you could linger on your sense\n\n56:27.900 --> 56:30.460\n that as you get closer to that understanding,\n\n56:30.460 --> 56:33.100\n it feels like you're getting farther away.\n\n56:33.100 --> 56:34.020\n Why is that?\n\n56:34.020 --> 56:36.020\n Because that often is the feeling\n\n56:36.020 --> 56:37.560\n until you're actually there.\n\n56:38.460 --> 56:42.860\n So like, you know, see that's when I'm running\n\n56:42.860 --> 56:44.940\n and I know there's only a mile left,\n\n56:44.940 --> 56:46.940\n it just feels like that mile\n\n56:46.940 --> 56:49.020\n is just getting longer and longer,\n\n56:49.020 --> 56:50.140\n but eventually you finish.\n\n56:50.140 --> 56:51.820\n So maybe we're getting close\n\n56:51.820 --> 56:54.540\n to cracking open these beginnings of a sense,\n\n56:54.540 --> 56:56.180\n like we'll talk about consciousness\n\n56:56.180 --> 56:59.580\n or these very difficult, big questions\n\n56:59.580 --> 57:00.900\n about the human mind.\n\n57:00.900 --> 57:02.380\n Where do they start?\n\n57:02.380 --> 57:04.700\n You're right to say we shouldn't generalize\n\n57:04.700 --> 57:06.420\n or make absolutist statements,\n\n57:06.420 --> 57:09.180\n but I would say right now,\n\n57:09.180 --> 57:12.900\n the reason things are looking even harder to crack\n\n57:12.900 --> 57:14.740\n than we had initially thought,\n\n57:14.740 --> 57:16.460\n we now have the data streams\n\n57:16.460 --> 57:18.220\n that we've wanted for so long\n\n57:18.220 --> 57:22.260\n in terms of activity patterns all across the brain\n\n57:22.260 --> 57:23.260\n at the level of cells.\n\n57:23.260 --> 57:26.660\n We can literally see what the cells are doing.\n\n57:26.660 --> 57:27.820\n Immense data sets.\n\n57:27.820 --> 57:30.780\n You know, we get, these are time series\n\n57:30.780 --> 57:34.080\n of one individual cell with sub second resolution\n\n57:34.080 --> 57:36.740\n and you can collect this from enormous numbers of cells\n\n57:36.740 --> 57:38.080\n across the brain.\n\n57:38.080 --> 57:40.860\n So very rich data sets that we've wanted for a long time\n\n57:40.860 --> 57:44.580\n and yet having these has not led\n\n57:44.580 --> 57:48.140\n to an understanding of truly where actions\n\n57:48.140 --> 57:51.980\n initiate in terms of regions or locations.\n\n57:51.980 --> 57:54.180\n And let's get a few questions on that.\n\n57:54.180 --> 57:59.180\n Is the answer, high level question by your intuition,\n\n57:59.660 --> 58:01.660\n is the answer within the data?\n\n58:01.660 --> 58:04.620\n Or do we need different kind of data?\n\n58:04.620 --> 58:07.900\n So we should also say that when you collect data\n\n58:07.900 --> 58:10.700\n about the brain, there's like the richness\n\n58:10.700 --> 58:12.620\n of information you're collecting,\n\n58:12.620 --> 58:14.760\n but there's also human doing stuff.\n\n58:14.760 --> 58:19.760\n And information, so static information about the human\n\n58:20.960 --> 58:23.480\n and dynamic information about the human\n\n58:23.480 --> 58:25.300\n and you can get them to do different stuff\n\n58:25.300 --> 58:27.400\n and you can select different humans\n\n58:27.400 --> 58:30.680\n and that's part of the collection of data aspect.\n\n58:30.680 --> 58:33.420\n So like when you're collecting data about the brain,\n\n58:33.420 --> 58:36.360\n there's some truths that you can,\n\n58:36.360 --> 58:38.200\n you know, in machine learning is like annotations,\n\n58:38.200 --> 58:39.680\n like supervised learning.\n\n58:39.680 --> 58:42.080\n There's some true things you can hold on to\n\n58:42.080 --> 58:46.040\n before you look at the full rich mess complexity\n\n58:46.040 --> 58:47.600\n of the human mind.\n\n58:47.600 --> 58:50.040\n So given the data you've looked at,\n\n58:50.040 --> 58:54.040\n do you think the answer for the origin of free will\n\n58:54.040 --> 58:56.640\n in the human mind can be found?\n\n58:58.120 --> 59:03.120\n Well, one amazing thing is that nobody's found it,\n\n59:04.340 --> 59:05.860\n but we have these rich data sets\n\n59:05.860 --> 59:08.880\n and then there's a conundrum which is,\n\n59:09.800 --> 59:11.520\n is it in the data and we just don't know\n\n59:11.520 --> 59:12.360\n how to look at it.\n\n59:12.360 --> 59:13.760\n Maybe we don't know the right scale,\n\n59:13.760 --> 59:15.800\n the right projection to make of the data,\n\n59:15.800 --> 59:17.760\n the right way to interpret it.\n\n59:17.760 --> 59:21.280\n And here's where causal testing becomes very valuable\n\n59:21.280 --> 59:23.820\n because then instead of just passively observing,\n\n59:25.200 --> 59:28.380\n well, here are the activity patterns\n\n59:28.380 --> 59:30.680\n and then here's the choice made by the animal.\n\n59:32.240 --> 59:36.040\n As we've gotten more powerful at reaching in\n\n59:36.040 --> 59:38.000\n and causing things to happen in the brain,\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.680\n turning up or down the activity\n\n59:40.680 --> 59:44.440\n of certain types of cells or defined populations of cells\n\n59:44.440 --> 59:46.400\n and seeing how that affects actions,\n\n59:46.400 --> 59:48.920\n these causal perturbations have turned out\n\n59:48.920 --> 59:50.480\n to be very valuable.\n\n59:50.480 --> 59:52.240\n We're just now getting to the point\n\n59:52.240 --> 59:57.240\n where we can apply these in very wide swaths of the brain\n\n59:58.440 --> 1:00:01.480\n at cellular resolution and so we're gonna be able,\n\n1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:03.280\n hopefully to make some headway on this question\n\n1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:07.320\n with causality and that's the one thing\n\n1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:10.120\n that optogenetics provides us this way of using light\n\n1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:12.160\n that we develop to control cells.\n\n1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:15.440\n This is an untapped, relatively untapped\n\n1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:17.160\n at this broad brain wide scale\n\n1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:18.880\n and hopefully we can get there in the near future.\n\n1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:22.640\n But I would say that the answer may be in the data\n\n1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:24.360\n but we don't know how to find it.\n\n1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:26.000\n Well, there's this interactive element\n\n1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.720\n like where you can cause stuff that's really powerful\n\n1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:30.560\n because you get to, I mean,\n\n1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:33.480\n as opposed to collecting data passively,\n\n1:00:33.480 --> 1:00:35.240\n you get your collecting data actively.\n\n1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:38.400\n So can you maybe describe one of the many things\n\n1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:40.960\n you're known for, one of the big things\n\n1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:43.560\n is called optogenetics, what is it?\n\n1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:46.160\n Optogenetics is a way of causing things to happen.\n\n1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:50.240\n It's a way of determining what actually matters\n\n1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:52.200\n in terms of the activity of the brain\n\n1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:55.040\n for the amazing things it does,\n\n1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:57.440\n sensation, cognition, action.\n\n1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:01.720\n And what it does is it provides activity.\n\n1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:04.320\n It's a way of playing in, if you will,\n\n1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:07.560\n activity patterns into precisely defined cells.\n\n1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:09.600\n And the way we do it is pretty cool, I think.\n\n1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:12.260\n It's, you know, right away there's a problem\n\n1:01:12.260 --> 1:01:13.360\n if you think about how do we do this?\n\n1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:16.360\n How could we play in well defined activity patterns\n\n1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:20.080\n and provide a stream of activity into this cell\n\n1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:22.680\n and that cell and that cell but not these other cells?\n\n1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:25.920\n So just for context, we're talking about the brains\n\n1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:30.920\n of mice, monkeys, humans,\n\n1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:35.880\n and then the goal is to try to control accurately\n\n1:01:35.880 --> 1:01:38.280\n the behavior of a single neuron\n\n1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:42.760\n and then to be able to monitor single collection\n\n1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:45.840\n of single neurons to then say, well,\n\n1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:50.600\n to draw some deeper insight about the origins,\n\n1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:53.280\n first of all, the function of different parts of the brain,\n\n1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:54.960\n different neurons, different kinds of neurons,\n\n1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:57.400\n but also the origins of the big things,\n\n1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:00.080\n the flap of the butterfly wing that leads\n\n1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:03.480\n to an actual behavioral thing.\n\n1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:06.000\n Yeah, so if you could, exactly, so if you could turn on\n\n1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.560\n or off the brain or parts of the brain or cell types\n\n1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:15.560\n or individual cells at the natural rate and rhythm\n\n1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:18.880\n and timing of normal brain activity,\n\n1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:19.840\n that would be immensely valuable\n\n1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:21.800\n because you could determine what actually mattered,\n\n1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.880\n what could cause complex things to happen\n\n1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:26.000\n and what could prevent complex things from happening\n\n1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.720\n in a specific way.\n\n1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:29.880\n But right away, you've got a problem if you wanna do this\n\n1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:33.280\n and scientists, neuroscientists have wanted to do this\n\n1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:34.240\n for a long time.\n\n1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:37.240\n Francis Crick of Double Helix of DNA fame,\n\n1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:40.560\n he wrote a famous paper in 1999.\n\n1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:43.080\n He got interested in neuroscience later in life\n\n1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:47.680\n and he said, what we need in neuroscience is a way\n\n1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:50.560\n that we could turn on or off the activity\n\n1:02:50.560 --> 1:02:55.440\n of individual types of neurons in a behaving animal.\n\n1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:00.200\n And he even said the ideal signal would be light\n\n1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:04.560\n because it would be fast, it could penetrate\n\n1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:06.740\n through the brain to some extent.\n\n1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:10.800\n And he had no idea how to do it.\n\n1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:13.640\n He said this would probably be very farfetched,\n\n1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:15.480\n but it would be a good thing.\n\n1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:17.120\n And so that's what you're actually saying,\n\n1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:19.280\n like if you wanna do this kind of thing\n\n1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:22.800\n and you imagine like, how do I get inside the brain?\n\n1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:24.560\n It's pretty difficult.\n\n1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:26.640\n It's pretty difficult and then even once you get in,\n\n1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:29.160\n it's hard because all brain cells are electrical,\n\n1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:31.440\n all neurons are electrically activated.\n\n1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:33.880\n And so if you wanted to use electricity\n\n1:03:34.740 --> 1:03:37.300\n as what you were putting in,\n\n1:03:37.300 --> 1:03:39.480\n you won't have any specificity at all.\n\n1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:41.360\n If you have an electrode, a wire,\n\n1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:44.360\n and you put it in the brain and you send current through it,\n\n1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:48.280\n all the cells near the electrode will be stimulated.\n\n1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:50.160\n That's like trying to control fish\n\n1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:51.680\n by spraying them with water.\n\n1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:56.280\n Yeah, right, because there's already a lot of electricity\n\n1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:58.240\n going around anyway and you're adding more,\n\n1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:00.800\n but there's no specificity\n\n1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.560\n even among the different kinds of cells either\n\n1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:05.040\n because all around the wire that you've put in,\n\n1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:06.820\n there are gonna be so many different cells\n\n1:04:06.820 --> 1:04:08.520\n doing totally different things,\n\n1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:10.520\n many of them in opposition to each other.\n\n1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:12.260\n We know that's one way the brain is set up.\n\n1:04:12.260 --> 1:04:14.240\n There are parts of the brain\n\n1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.000\n where neurons side by side\n\n1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.360\n are doing completely different things\n\n1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:20.240\n and maybe even antagonistic to each other.\n\n1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:21.080\n So what do you do?\n\n1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:23.700\n How do you play in activity with any kind of specificity?\n\n1:04:23.700 --> 1:04:26.440\n Well, what you do is use,\n\n1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.840\n what we found is what you can do is\n\n1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:33.200\n make some cells responsive to light.\n\n1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:36.700\n Now, normally no cells deep in the brain\n\n1:04:36.700 --> 1:04:37.640\n really respond to light.\n\n1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:39.120\n They're not built for that.\n\n1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:42.360\n There's no reason for them to respond to light in there,\n\n1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:45.240\n which is a great situation to start with\n\n1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:48.960\n because any light sensitivity you can provide to some cells\n\n1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:51.560\n will be a huge signal above the noise.\n\n1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:53.520\n And so that's what we do with optogenetics.\n\n1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:58.520\n We take genes, bits of DNA from microbes,\n\n1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:00.800\n single celled organisms,\n\n1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:05.080\n and these single celled organisms like algae,\n\n1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:09.360\n they make little proteins\n\n1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.960\n that sit in the surface of their cells\n\n1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:15.240\n that receive light, capture a photon of light\n\n1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:18.400\n and open up a little hole in the membrane of the cell\n\n1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:21.840\n and let charged particles, ions like sodium and potassium\n\n1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:24.440\n flow across the membrane of the cell.\n\n1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:27.440\n And that, these algae and bacteria,\n\n1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:28.760\n they do this for their own reasons\n\n1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:30.280\n because that helps them move,\n\n1:05:30.280 --> 1:05:32.900\n it helps them make and use energy.\n\n1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:36.560\n But that's a beautiful thing for neuroscience\n\n1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:38.400\n because movement of ions,\n\n1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:40.680\n charged particles across the membrane of the cell\n\n1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:43.960\n is exactly the kind of electricity that neurons work with.\n\n1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:47.240\n So if we can take this bit of DNA\n\n1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:48.780\n that encodes this beautiful protein\n\n1:05:48.780 --> 1:05:51.440\n that turns light into electricity from algae,\n\n1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:54.600\n and if we can put it into some neurons,\n\n1:05:54.600 --> 1:05:58.200\n but not other neurons, which we can do using genetic tricks,\n\n1:05:58.200 --> 1:05:59.440\n then you've got a situation,\n\n1:05:59.440 --> 1:06:01.240\n then you can shine on the light\n\n1:06:01.240 --> 1:06:03.920\n and only the cells that have the gene\n\n1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:05.760\n and that are expressing the gene\n\n1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:08.160\n will be the initial direct cells\n\n1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.200\n that are activated by the light.\n\n1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:10.880\n And so that's the essence of optogenetics\n\n1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.600\n is the ability to do that.\n\n1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:14.100\n We get that initial specificity\n\n1:06:14.100 --> 1:06:15.840\n that you could never get with an electrode.\n\n1:06:15.840 --> 1:06:18.240\n So let me say that this is,\n\n1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:22.560\n we recently got the Alaska Prize for this.\n\n1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:24.240\n It's a brilliant idea.\n\n1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:28.880\n So I talked to Andrew Huberman,\n\n1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:31.060\n who's a friend of yours, friend of mine,\n\n1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:33.520\n so not to jinx things,\n\n1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:36.720\n but he believes that you deserve the Nobel Prize for this.\n\n1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:41.720\n So, I do too, but what, my votes.\n\n1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:44.680\n Anyway, the thing is, it doesn't matter.\n\n1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:47.440\n Prizes will be all forgotten, all of us will be forgotten.\n\n1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:49.880\n When the cool idea is a cool idea,\n\n1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:51.600\n that's a really powerful idea.\n\n1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:53.760\n It's actually, the origins of it\n\n1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:57.580\n you might be interested in are even, are very deep.\n\n1:06:57.580 --> 1:06:59.820\n There was a botanist in St. Petersburg\n\n1:06:59.820 --> 1:07:01.520\n named Andre Fomensen.\n\n1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:05.600\n In 1866, he published a paper\n\n1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:07.840\n on the single celled green algae.\n\n1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:09.960\n And he was the botanist who first noticed\n\n1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:12.060\n that they moved in response to light.\n\n1:07:12.060 --> 1:07:14.500\n These are tiny single celled algae that have flagella,\n\n1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.440\n so they swim through the water.\n\n1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:20.080\n And he noticed this, he was a botanist,\n\n1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:21.520\n and he published this.\n\n1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:26.100\n It was a paper, you know, he wrote in German,\n\n1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:27.720\n but he published it in a French journal,\n\n1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:29.640\n and he was doing it from St. Petersburg,\n\n1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:32.400\n so it was a very international effort.\n\n1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:34.120\n But you have to go back to 1866,\n\n1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:37.080\n and that, I like to highlight how far back\n\n1:07:37.080 --> 1:07:40.840\n that discovery goes is back to Andre Fomensen.\n\n1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:44.040\n And this is a, it highlights the value\n\n1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:45.720\n of just pure basic science discovery.\n\n1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:48.380\n That always originates somewhere\n\n1:07:48.380 --> 1:07:50.520\n in the Eastern European block.\n\n1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:53.600\n But I don't think he expected the splicing\n\n1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:57.920\n of genetic material from the algae into the human brain.\n\n1:07:57.920 --> 1:07:59.440\n And one of the cool things we've been able to do now\n\n1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:02.040\n with modern methods is to really study these proteins.\n\n1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:04.280\n And so we've discovered some of these proteins,\n\n1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:05.480\n other groups have as well.\n\n1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:07.640\n We've dived deep into their structure,\n\n1:08:07.640 --> 1:08:09.920\n just like the double helix structure of DNA\n\n1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:12.560\n was uncovered with X ray crystallography.\n\n1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:14.840\n We used the same method in X ray crystallography\n\n1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:18.080\n to see how these beautiful little proteins work.\n\n1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:20.080\n We reengineered them for all kinds of function.\n\n1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:22.360\n We can make them, instead of responding to blue light,\n\n1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:24.520\n we can make them respond to red light.\n\n1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:26.400\n We can speed them up, slow them down.\n\n1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.920\n We can make them, with genetic engineering,\n\n1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:32.320\n we can make them have different ions flow through them.\n\n1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:34.720\n And so it's this convergence, as you said,\n\n1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:36.920\n like the botanist in 1866 couldn't have predicted\n\n1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:38.440\n what we could do with this.\n\n1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:40.680\n And the fact that we've been able to discover\n\n1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:42.240\n how these beautiful proteins work\n\n1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:45.040\n and then apply them to neuroscience\n\n1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:46.280\n is really a thrilling story.\n\n1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:49.440\n Is it possible to achieve scale, do you think, with this?\n\n1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:53.760\n Meaning, like what is the progress of the next 50 years,\n\n1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:56.840\n 100 years looks like in terms of the precision\n\n1:08:56.840 --> 1:08:59.120\n and the scale of control of using light?\n\n1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:02.320\n It's going so fast it's hard to predict.\n\n1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:03.920\n I'll give you a sense of it though.\n\n1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:11.120\n First paper we published in 2005,\n\n1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:12.400\n that was just encultured neurons.\n\n1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:14.520\n By 2007, so that was in a dish.\n\n1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:17.520\n By 2007, we had it working in behaving mice.\n\n1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:20.800\n By 2009, we had it pretty general.\n\n1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:23.320\n So we had methods to really make it a versatile method.\n\n1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:26.280\n It could be applied to essentially any cell.\n\n1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:29.240\n By 2012, we could get to single cell resolution.\n\n1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:31.080\n We used light guidance strategies\n\n1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:36.520\n to target individual cells in the brain of a living mouse.\n\n1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:42.840\n By 2019, we were able to control up to 20 to 50\n\n1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:44.840\n individually specified single cells\n\n1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:48.600\n in the brain of a mouse in ways that specifically changed\n\n1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:50.920\n its behavior, that could bias its decisions one\n\n1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:51.680\n way or the other.\n\n1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:58.600\n In fact, we could take a mouse and without any visual stimulus\n\n1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:01.160\n at all, we could make it act as if it\n\n1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:03.440\n had seen a particular visual stimulus\n\n1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:07.640\n by playing in, using the single cell resolution optogenetics,\n\n1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:11.040\n a specific pattern of activity into 20 or 25\n\n1:10:11.040 --> 1:10:12.960\n individually specified cells.\n\n1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:15.400\n That's 2019 to your question of scale.\n\n1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:18.200\n Now in 2022, we're controlling hundreds\n\n1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.840\n of individually specified single cells\n\n1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:24.560\n over all of visual cortex of a mouse, all the part\n\n1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:28.800\n of the brain that is the initial direct target\n\n1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:31.160\n of the incoming information from the retina.\n\n1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:34.320\n Are you constrained to specific types of cells currently?\n\n1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:36.800\n Like you mentioned, long range is easier.\n\n1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:39.680\n Is there constraints on which cells?\n\n1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:41.040\n Now there really isn't.\n\n1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:43.600\n Now that we have this individual cell guidance,\n\n1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:48.840\n we can target any individual kind of cell very reliably.\n\n1:10:48.840 --> 1:10:55.520\n And so now to your question of scale, how far can we go?\n\n1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:58.680\n Well, things are moving quickly.\n\n1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:00.000\n It's hard to say.\n\n1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:04.560\n We can access individual cells across the entire brain now.\n\n1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:09.080\n If you look 10, 20 years in the future,\n\n1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:11.880\n I think we'll surprise ourselves.\n\n1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:14.520\n But the fact that we're already able to cause\n\n1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:17.600\n specific perceptions to happen and specific actions\n\n1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:19.480\n means we're essentially where we want to be.\n\n1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:25.960\n And now it's a matter of just more experiments,\n\n1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:26.800\n more discoveries.\n\n1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:29.960\n But the basic principles are clear now.\n\n1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:32.200\n The basic capability is there.\n\n1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:36.320\n Is there a pathway to doing the same for humans?\n\n1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:38.400\n Optogenetics is primarily, it's a discovery tool\n\n1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:41.760\n that really is well suited for use in mice and rats\n\n1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:48.120\n and monkeys because it involves putting in a gene\n\n1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:49.720\n and also delivering light.\n\n1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:52.600\n And those are two things that you can do in human beings,\n\n1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:55.760\n but you'd want to do in a very careful way.\n\n1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:59.280\n Now that said, there is actually just less than a year ago,\n\n1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:02.480\n my friend Botan Droska in Switzerland,\n\n1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:07.760\n he did the first human optogenetics therapy.\n\n1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:10.000\n And he published this in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\n1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.760\n So about 10, 12 years ago, he and I\n\n1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:17.240\n published a paper together where we gave him\n\n1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:21.000\n one of our optogenetic tools, one\n\n1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:26.000\n of these light activated regulators of ion flow.\n\n1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.840\n These are called microbial opsins, by the way, opsins.\n\n1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:33.120\n And he put one of those into an extracted retina\n\n1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:35.760\n from a human being who had died.\n\n1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:37.800\n So it was a cadaveric retina.\n\n1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:43.000\n And he was able to show that optical control in this paper\n\n1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.360\n was able to turn on or off individual cells\n\n1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:46.440\n in the human retina.\n\n1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:48.480\n So that was a while back.\n\n1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:53.200\n He spent about 10 years of going through all the regulatory\n\n1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:56.480\n hoops and hurdles and going through primate studies.\n\n1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:00.560\n And finally, he was able to take a human being\n\n1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:03.280\n with a retinal degeneration syndrome, so someone\n\n1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:06.480\n who was blind in both eyes.\n\n1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:12.320\n And he gave one of these opsins into one eye of this human\n\n1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:16.720\n being who was blind and with the goal\n\n1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:20.760\n of conferring light sensitivity onto this retina that\n\n1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:23.440\n was not able to see light.\n\n1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:26.440\n And he was able to make this person see through that eye.\n\n1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:27.640\n So he took a blind person.\n\n1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.080\n And the blind person could see now,\n\n1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:33.760\n could reach for objects selectively on a table.\n\n1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:36.400\n And he published this in Nature Medicine.\n\n1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:39.600\n And it was, you know, that's an amazing thing.\n\n1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:40.480\n Do you know the title of the paper?\n\n1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:41.480\n What's his name again?\n\n1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:43.840\n Rosca, R O S K A.\n\n1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:45.680\n And you look up the Nature paper.\n\n1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:46.760\n Nature Medicine.\n\n1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:47.680\n Nature Medicine.\n\n1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:49.360\n So that's sort of proof of principle.\n\n1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:51.200\n Now, the retina is very accessible.\n\n1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:52.640\n It's near the surface.\n\n1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.280\n You can use natural light, or you\n\n1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:57.800\n can use brighter natural light.\n\n1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:01.960\n I'm myself, I see optogenetics as a discovery tool.\n\n1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:04.520\n It's a way to figure out the principles by which the brain\n\n1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:05.720\n works and how it operates.\n\n1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:07.560\n Partial recovery of visual function\n\n1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:10.120\n in a blind patient after optogenetic therapy.\n\n1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:14.360\n So he went through the full process of doing primates\n\n1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:17.200\n and then going, wow, that's dedication\n\n1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:20.320\n and that's really exciting to see.\n\n1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:23.920\n As beautiful as that is, and I'm glad he did all that work,\n\n1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:27.240\n there are so many other ways that optogenetics\n\n1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:28.520\n could help with therapies.\n\n1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:31.760\n Once you know the principles, then any kind of therapy\n\n1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:32.840\n can become more powerful.\n\n1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:36.720\n Once you know the causal cells in a symptom,\n\n1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:40.120\n like in lack of motivation or inability\n\n1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:43.960\n to enjoy things or altered sleep or altered energy,\n\n1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:46.080\n once you know the cells that are causal,\n\n1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:49.640\n then you can make medications that address those cells.\n\n1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:52.360\n You could address brain stimulation treatments that\n\n1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:53.440\n might address those cells.\n\n1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:58.720\n Also, diagnosis, very effective systematic way of diagnosing,\n\n1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:01.360\n or at least providing you rich data\n\n1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:04.680\n to some of these deep questions about schizophrenia,\n\n1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:08.800\n about bipolar, all of those kinds of things.\n\n1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:11.720\n The tools are low resolution currently\n\n1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:15.320\n for determining the degree to which you have a thing\n\n1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:17.920\n and whether you have a thing at all.\n\n1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:18.840\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:23.040\n And so the hope is that's a great example\n\n1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:27.640\n of how you can cure or you can provide\n\n1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:30.120\n some relief for a symptom of a person who has\n\n1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:33.120\n a serious degenerative disease.\n\n1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:36.200\n But the principles are what we're after,\n\n1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:39.520\n and that's why I spend, even though I'm a psychiatrist,\n\n1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:42.480\n even though I still see patients, I'm not myself\n\n1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:45.480\n trying to drive any clinical trials in the lab.\n\n1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:49.400\n I'm trying to discover, and then any kind of therapy\n\n1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:50.880\n could result from that.\n\n1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:54.960\n What do you think about my friend,\n\n1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:58.360\n Elon Musk, and his efforts with Neuralink?\n\n1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:02.840\n So this is another, there's a lot of things to say here,\n\n1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:05.360\n because there's a lot of ideas under the umbrella\n\n1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:09.760\n of Neuralink, but one of them is to use electrical signals\n\n1:16:09.760 --> 1:16:13.280\n to stimulate, and then you also record,\n\n1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:15.840\n you collect electrical signals from the brain\n\n1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:17.920\n at a higher and higher resolution,\n\n1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:22.920\n and you go implant surgically the methods\n\n1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:26.440\n by which you do the stimulation and the data collection.\n\n1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:30.520\n So it's possible for the ideas of optogenetics\n\n1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:34.080\n to play well with this, and we can even zoom out\n\n1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:36.960\n outside of just Neuralink, and just the whole idea\n\n1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:39.520\n of brain computer interfaces.\n\n1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.760\n What are your thoughts?\n\n1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:43.600\n Well, I think the engineering that they've done\n\n1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:44.480\n is actually pretty cool.\n\n1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:46.120\n So I like the.\n\n1:16:46.120 --> 1:16:47.000\n Robots.\n\n1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.480\n Yeah, from the design perspective,\n\n1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:53.240\n and it was a design approach that wasn't being taken\n\n1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:55.760\n in academia, and it's great that they did it,\n\n1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:57.400\n and I think it's pretty cool.\n\n1:16:57.400 --> 1:16:59.000\n So I'll say that.\n\n1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.560\n Also, there are many ways that you can record\n\n1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:06.320\n from many thousands of neurons, and that's not the only way.\n\n1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:08.000\n It's a very interesting way.\n\n1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:12.400\n We and others are using brain penetrating electrodes\n\n1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:14.200\n that actually get quite deep.\n\n1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:16.440\n This whole structure of the brain is very interesting.\n\n1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:20.440\n There's the surface cortex, where it's the most recently\n\n1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:23.680\n emergent part of the brain in evolution.\n\n1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:24.800\n Mammals have it.\n\n1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:27.000\n Reptiles have something a little bit like it,\n\n1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.880\n but it's not really the full thing.\n\n1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:31.040\n This is a very recent thing.\n\n1:17:31.040 --> 1:17:33.600\n That's what we can access with some of these,\n\n1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:35.080\n like the Neuralink approach,\n\n1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:38.280\n and with some of these short electrodes.\n\n1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:39.480\n This part of the brain, the cortex,\n\n1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:40.680\n is only a few millimeters thick.\n\n1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:42.880\n There's so much that's deep, though, that's so important.\n\n1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:44.680\n There's the striatum, there's the thalamus.\n\n1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:49.120\n There are the parts of the brain that drive motivation,\n\n1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:52.960\n that drive hunger and thirst and social interaction\n\n1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:57.960\n and parenting and flight and fear and anxiety.\n\n1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:00.440\n All these things are, there's so much that's deep\n\n1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:02.800\n that these surface approaches are not getting to.\n\n1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:06.600\n And so we and others are using these very long electrodes\n\n1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:08.800\n that help us get deep, and we can still record\n\n1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:11.600\n for many cells, many thousands of cells.\n\n1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:15.360\n We can have multiple of these at once in the same animal.\n\n1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:18.440\n And so there's a diversity of methods to get to this goal.\n\n1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:21.240\n I think it's great that people coming from\n\n1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:26.760\n outside academia will bring ideas\n\n1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:29.040\n that weren't being worked on, at least approaches.\n\n1:18:29.040 --> 1:18:31.160\n They may turn out to be synergistic.\n\n1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:33.600\n These things do work very well with optogenetics\n\n1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:37.400\n because all these electrical recording methods,\n\n1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:39.640\n that's one channel of information flow.\n\n1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:43.200\n Light delivery is a separate, more or less independent.\n\n1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:45.360\n There can be some artifacts that happen,\n\n1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:46.200\n but if you're careful,\n\n1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:49.840\n it's another independent pathway of information flow.\n\n1:18:49.840 --> 1:18:53.160\n And we've done really fun experiments in mice\n\n1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:56.240\n where we play in patterns of activity with light,\n\n1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:59.480\n and we record activity from across the brain of a mouse\n\n1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:02.320\n electrically, and so using optical and electrical together\n\n1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:04.000\n is extremely powerful.\n\n1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:08.260\n So like optoelectric brain computer interfaces.\n\n1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:13.080\n Which, by the way, there's efforts on the computing side\n\n1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:16.200\n to build optoelectric servers,\n\n1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:17.920\n so like where you have both electricity.\n\n1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.160\n So because optics is really interesting,\n\n1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:22.880\n light is a very interesting method of communication\n\n1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:26.220\n that's, like you said, orthogonal in many ways.\n\n1:19:26.220 --> 1:19:28.920\n It doesn't have some of the constraints of bandwidth\n\n1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:32.400\n that electricity does going through wires,\n\n1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:34.320\n but you're able to,\n\n1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:38.640\n but less ability to control precisely at scale.\n\n1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.680\n So like there's challenges and there's benefits,\n\n1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:42.200\n and having those two interplays\n\n1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:44.040\n really, really, really fascinating,\n\n1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:46.640\n especially when obviously on the other side\n\n1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:51.640\n of your signal is a biological mesh, mush, mushy mesh.\n\n1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:54.660\n Well, the mushy mesh is kind of interesting\n\n1:19:54.660 --> 1:19:56.460\n because there are problems with light.\n\n1:19:56.460 --> 1:19:57.980\n Light scatters in the brain,\n\n1:19:57.980 --> 1:20:01.420\n so the photons don't just go linearly through.\n\n1:20:01.420 --> 1:20:04.220\n Whenever they hit an interface between fat and water,\n\n1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:08.060\n lipid and water, they bounce off in different directions.\n\n1:20:08.060 --> 1:20:10.820\n And so you can come in with all the resolution you want.\n\n1:20:10.820 --> 1:20:13.540\n You could play in an incredibly detailed,\n\n1:20:13.540 --> 1:20:15.460\n high resolution pattern of light,\n\n1:20:15.460 --> 1:20:18.300\n but the photons start scattering quite quickly,\n\n1:20:18.300 --> 1:20:20.980\n and by the time you've gone a couple of millimeters deep,\n\n1:20:20.980 --> 1:20:24.580\n you've lost almost all that fine spatial information.\n\n1:20:24.580 --> 1:20:26.980\n So, but we've developed workarounds.\n\n1:20:26.980 --> 1:20:29.140\n The longer wavelength light you use,\n\n1:20:29.140 --> 1:20:31.140\n if you get into the infrared, there's less scattering.\n\n1:20:31.140 --> 1:20:33.900\n You can use two photon methods or three photon methods\n\n1:20:33.900 --> 1:20:36.100\n where the photons have to arrive all together\n\n1:20:36.100 --> 1:20:37.620\n at the same time.\n\n1:20:37.620 --> 1:20:39.220\n You can put in fiber optics.\n\n1:20:39.220 --> 1:20:42.420\n We developed these fiber optic methods in 2007\n\n1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:44.220\n where you can access these deep structures\n\n1:20:44.220 --> 1:20:45.460\n with fiber optic methods,\n\n1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:46.980\n and you can put many of these fiber optics\n\n1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:48.860\n at the same time in an animal.\n\n1:20:48.860 --> 1:20:53.300\n We've used holographic methods, 3D holograms,\n\n1:20:53.300 --> 1:20:56.900\n to play in hundreds of individual cell size spots of light,\n\n1:20:56.900 --> 1:20:59.220\n and we can change those quickly.\n\n1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:00.340\n So there are a lot of tricks,\n\n1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:01.860\n a lot of interesting optics engineering\n\n1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:03.860\n that has come together with neuroscience\n\n1:21:03.860 --> 1:21:04.820\n in a pretty exciting way.\n\n1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:06.060\n Well, that is engineering, too.\n\n1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:07.660\n It was just super, super, super exciting.\n\n1:21:07.660 --> 1:21:10.820\n I should mention, because I remember I mentioned Elon.\n\n1:21:10.820 --> 1:21:15.740\n I recently got, for the first time ever, got COVID.\n\n1:21:15.740 --> 1:21:20.740\n Well, how did I go so long without,\n\n1:21:21.300 --> 1:21:24.340\n finally, so I'm all vaccinated and everything like that.\n\n1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:27.900\n And so I got, because I think he mentioned it publicly\n\n1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:28.980\n so I can mention it,\n\n1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:30.620\n but I won't mention anybody else involved.\n\n1:21:30.620 --> 1:21:33.780\n But hanging out, we all got, Elon got COVID.\n\n1:21:33.780 --> 1:21:35.180\n And the interesting thing about,\n\n1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:36.540\n maybe you can comment about this.\n\n1:21:36.540 --> 1:21:38.860\n So I was only sick for like a half a day.\n\n1:21:38.860 --> 1:21:40.540\n I got a fever of like 104.\n\n1:21:40.540 --> 1:21:44.020\n I just went up and then crashed.\n\n1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:47.580\n And then I was, now maybe I'm just seeing\n\n1:21:47.580 --> 1:21:48.700\n the silver lining of everything,\n\n1:21:48.700 --> 1:21:53.700\n but afterwards, I have like a greater clarity\n\n1:21:54.740 --> 1:21:55.580\n about the world.\n\n1:21:57.580 --> 1:21:58.740\n You just think it's greater clarity.\n\n1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:01.980\n Maybe, maybe I just, it was so,\n\n1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:06.140\n maybe so intensely the mind fog kind of thing\n\n1:22:06.140 --> 1:22:07.860\n for such a short amount of time.\n\n1:22:07.860 --> 1:22:12.060\n But the people who were involved were also reporting this.\n\n1:22:12.060 --> 1:22:13.180\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n1:22:13.180 --> 1:22:17.580\n It's like, because I do know like the immune system\n\n1:22:18.700 --> 1:22:21.860\n is involved with the brain in very interesting ways.\n\n1:22:21.860 --> 1:22:24.780\n So like the human mind also incorporates all these other,\n\n1:22:24.780 --> 1:22:28.140\n it's not just the, it's not just the nervous system.\n\n1:22:28.140 --> 1:22:30.220\n And I just wonder, because everyone always says,\n\n1:22:30.220 --> 1:22:32.540\n no, not like, everyone always says like COVID\n\n1:22:32.540 --> 1:22:34.740\n does all these bad things or whatever the disease is\n\n1:22:34.740 --> 1:22:36.060\n or whatever the virus.\n\n1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:39.740\n But I wonder like, I hate to be a Steven Pinker on this,\n\n1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:42.180\n but like, I wonder what the benefits of certain disease are\n\n1:22:42.180 --> 1:22:43.860\n if you're able to recover.\n\n1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:46.460\n Like what, is there some like, again,\n\n1:22:46.460 --> 1:22:47.540\n don't want to romanticize it,\n\n1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:50.180\n but if your system goes to some kind of hardship\n\n1:22:50.180 --> 1:22:51.900\n and you come out on the other end,\n\n1:22:51.900 --> 1:22:54.860\n I wonder sometimes if there's a greater,\n\n1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:56.460\n maybe killed off a bunch of neurons\n\n1:22:56.460 --> 1:22:57.420\n that didn't need anyway,\n\n1:22:57.420 --> 1:22:58.860\n and they were actually getting in the way.\n\n1:22:58.860 --> 1:23:00.580\n There were the hater neurons.\n\n1:23:00.580 --> 1:23:01.420\n I don't know.\n\n1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:02.540\n Well, that was your inner critic that I was talking about.\n\n1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:03.380\n Exactly.\n\n1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:05.060\n You killed off your critic.\n\n1:23:05.060 --> 1:23:07.340\n Well, you know, there are mechanisms for what you,\n\n1:23:07.340 --> 1:23:10.460\n the potential mechanisms for what you're talking about.\n\n1:23:10.460 --> 1:23:13.260\n There are, there's actually been a fair bit of research\n\n1:23:13.260 --> 1:23:18.260\n on post COVID neurological function.\n\n1:23:18.740 --> 1:23:20.940\n Actually, my wife, Michelle Monjay, who's at Stanford,\n\n1:23:20.940 --> 1:23:22.340\n she's done a lot of this work.\n\n1:23:22.340 --> 1:23:25.500\n Akiko Iwasaki at Yale has done a lot of this.\n\n1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:30.300\n But what they found is that there's a loss of myelin.\n\n1:23:30.300 --> 1:23:33.380\n This is the coating of those long range projections\n\n1:23:33.380 --> 1:23:35.420\n that go from one part of the brain to another.\n\n1:23:35.420 --> 1:23:37.580\n Myelin is this sort of insulator\n\n1:23:37.580 --> 1:23:39.220\n that coats these long range projections\n\n1:23:39.220 --> 1:23:42.220\n and makes the impulses go faster and more reliably.\n\n1:23:43.620 --> 1:23:48.620\n And there's altered function of the myelin producing cells\n\n1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:52.660\n and altered myelin in the case of COVID.\n\n1:23:52.660 --> 1:23:55.660\n They've looked in both mouse and human brains.\n\n1:23:56.620 --> 1:23:59.980\n And, but of course it could be very idiosyncratic.\n\n1:23:59.980 --> 1:24:03.380\n Many people have cognitive problems post COVID.\n\n1:24:03.380 --> 1:24:04.500\n You're definitely aware of that.\n\n1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:07.260\n So many people report this persistent brain fog\n\n1:24:07.260 --> 1:24:08.940\n and the ability to function.\n\n1:24:08.940 --> 1:24:11.460\n But it depends on where the inflammation was.\n\n1:24:11.460 --> 1:24:14.980\n Maybe the people who have dysfunction post COVID,\n\n1:24:14.980 --> 1:24:17.060\n they had a global effect.\n\n1:24:17.060 --> 1:24:20.300\n Maybe you lost some of these projections\n\n1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:23.700\n that were restraining you in some way.\n\n1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:25.300\n And these plausibly exist.\n\n1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:30.020\n And it's known that there are cell populations\n\n1:24:30.020 --> 1:24:33.180\n in the prefrontal cortex that actively restrain\n\n1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:36.380\n deeper structures from expressing what they do.\n\n1:24:36.380 --> 1:24:39.980\n And it's theoretically possible that you had a lucky.\n\n1:24:40.900 --> 1:24:42.380\n Somebody has to get lucky, right?\n\n1:24:42.380 --> 1:24:44.020\n Somebody has to get lucky, yeah.\n\n1:24:44.020 --> 1:24:45.140\n Why not me?\n\n1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:48.900\n All right, if we can actually go back to this idea\n\n1:24:48.900 --> 1:24:51.780\n of trying through optogenetics\n\n1:24:53.700 --> 1:24:58.700\n to find origins of when the wave first starts.\n\n1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:01.780\n Origins of a decision.\n\n1:25:01.780 --> 1:25:06.780\n Origin of idea.\n\n1:25:07.020 --> 1:25:10.180\n Origin of maybe consciousness\n\n1:25:10.180 --> 1:25:12.700\n or the subjective experience.\n\n1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:15.140\n So origin of things in the mind.\n\n1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:20.140\n So one thing, Carl Jung, is there a God neuron?\n\n1:25:21.980 --> 1:25:24.020\n Is there a belief neuron?\n\n1:25:24.020 --> 1:25:27.540\n Is there, so through this methodology of optogenetics,\n\n1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:32.540\n can you start getting to where a belief begins\n\n1:25:34.940 --> 1:25:37.340\n or an idea begins?\n\n1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:41.020\n And especially looking at the strongest of our beliefs.\n\n1:25:41.020 --> 1:25:43.220\n Maybe beliefs of love and hate,\n\n1:25:43.220 --> 1:25:48.220\n but religious belief into something really grand,\n\n1:25:51.100 --> 1:25:52.860\n on the grandest of scale.\n\n1:25:52.860 --> 1:25:57.860\n Yeah, neuroscience and neurology point us a little bit.\n\n1:26:00.580 --> 1:26:02.900\n We don't have an answer to that, but for example.\n\n1:26:02.900 --> 1:26:04.340\n A lot of these questions I'm gonna ask you,\n\n1:26:04.340 --> 1:26:07.380\n there's no good answer, but you're providing the tools\n\n1:26:07.380 --> 1:26:09.660\n that give us hope to find the answer one day.\n\n1:26:09.660 --> 1:26:11.020\n Yeah, and we have early clues.\n\n1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:14.700\n So for example, when patients with epilepsy\n\n1:26:14.700 --> 1:26:19.700\n have experiences of religiosity as part of their seizure\n\n1:26:19.700 --> 1:26:22.620\n or the aura before their seizure,\n\n1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:26.700\n very often those are in the temporal lobe,\n\n1:26:26.700 --> 1:26:30.420\n in these parts of the brain that are at the side.\n\n1:26:30.420 --> 1:26:33.580\n And so that's an initial clue.\n\n1:26:33.580 --> 1:26:37.780\n There are also parts of the brain that are involved\n\n1:26:37.780 --> 1:26:41.500\n in the definition of the self\n\n1:26:41.500 --> 1:26:45.900\n and defining the borders or boundaries of the self.\n\n1:26:45.900 --> 1:26:48.980\n And we know this, this is some experiments that we did\n\n1:26:48.980 --> 1:26:50.780\n in my lab, there's a part of the brain\n\n1:26:50.780 --> 1:26:55.420\n where if there's a rhythm of a particular type,\n\n1:26:55.420 --> 1:26:59.980\n you can cause a separation of the sense of self\n\n1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:02.100\n from the sense of the body.\n\n1:27:02.100 --> 1:27:04.460\n What's normally bound up and unitary,\n\n1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:06.060\n we normally think of ourself and our body\n\n1:27:06.060 --> 1:27:08.180\n as pretty tightly bound up together,\n\n1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:09.780\n those can be separated, it turns out.\n\n1:27:09.780 --> 1:27:11.020\n We can't take that for granted.\n\n1:27:11.020 --> 1:27:12.060\n And there are certain conditions,\n\n1:27:12.060 --> 1:27:14.900\n certain patterns of activity in one part of the brain\n\n1:27:14.900 --> 1:27:17.220\n called the retro splenial cortex,\n\n1:27:17.220 --> 1:27:20.900\n where you can actually separate those two out.\n\n1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:25.180\n And so if you think about these very big questions,\n\n1:27:25.180 --> 1:27:29.420\n you know, what is, where are the origins of religiosity?\n\n1:27:29.420 --> 1:27:33.140\n Where, how do we define the boundaries of who we are\n\n1:27:33.140 --> 1:27:35.500\n relative to others and to the world?\n\n1:27:36.660 --> 1:27:40.460\n How do we link ourself to our body\n\n1:27:40.460 --> 1:27:42.100\n and how can that become separated?\n\n1:27:42.100 --> 1:27:44.060\n These are actually, believe it or not,\n\n1:27:44.060 --> 1:27:48.900\n now accessible and rigorously and quantitatively so.\n\n1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:50.820\n We did an experiment with optogenetics\n\n1:27:50.820 --> 1:27:53.620\n where we provided this abnormal rhythm\n\n1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:57.100\n to this particular part of the mouse brain\n\n1:27:57.100 --> 1:28:02.100\n and we saw this separation of detection of a stimulus\n\n1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:04.620\n and caring about it.\n\n1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:07.580\n So that's like stimulating something about the mouse brain\n\n1:28:07.580 --> 1:28:11.940\n that affects these neurons that give the conception of self.\n\n1:28:11.940 --> 1:28:15.380\n So you're able to dissociate the experience\n\n1:28:15.380 --> 1:28:17.940\n from the impact of the experience onto you.\n\n1:28:17.940 --> 1:28:19.540\n That's right, exactly right.\n\n1:28:19.540 --> 1:28:22.140\n So like these are the goals of meditation.\n\n1:28:23.580 --> 1:28:25.820\n These are the goals whenever I get drunk,\n\n1:28:25.820 --> 1:28:27.300\n pretty much effective.\n\n1:28:27.300 --> 1:28:28.980\n I mean, that's not a scientific statement,\n\n1:28:28.980 --> 1:28:30.940\n just an experiential anecdotal one.\n\n1:28:32.060 --> 1:28:34.740\n Also psychedelics seek to this,\n\n1:28:35.900 --> 1:28:37.940\n to attain this kind of state.\n\n1:28:37.940 --> 1:28:39.100\n That's so interesting.\n\n1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:40.500\n Well, you mentioned psychedelics, you know,\n\n1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:45.500\n DMT and 5MeO DMT, these create this religious experience,\n\n1:28:45.580 --> 1:28:47.580\n this connection, people describe them\n\n1:28:47.580 --> 1:28:49.500\n as a strong connection to God.\n\n1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:53.420\n That in theory, these are accessible with modern methods.\n\n1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:56.180\n Now that we have these rich recording methods,\n\n1:28:56.180 --> 1:29:01.180\n we can explore what are the precise millisecond resolution,\n\n1:29:01.420 --> 1:29:05.300\n cellular resolution, brain wide manifestations\n\n1:29:05.300 --> 1:29:06.660\n of these altered states.\n\n1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:11.020\n So like you could look at an altered state like on DMT,\n\n1:29:11.020 --> 1:29:14.540\n record it across many people,\n\n1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:18.020\n and then from there see where do these experiences\n\n1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:21.540\n originate in the brain in terms of single neurons,\n\n1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:25.260\n and then how do they propagate\n\n1:29:25.260 --> 1:29:26.540\n and interact with everything else?\n\n1:29:26.540 --> 1:29:30.980\n And if there's some kind of common signal,\n\n1:29:30.980 --> 1:29:34.340\n like how do you narrow down the set of neurons\n\n1:29:34.340 --> 1:29:36.740\n that are responsible for particular experience\n\n1:29:36.740 --> 1:29:38.740\n or for a particular behavioral effect?\n\n1:29:38.740 --> 1:29:40.460\n Yeah, here's where optogenetics is so useful\n\n1:29:40.460 --> 1:29:45.460\n because anytime you give an agent like ketamine or PCP,\n\n1:29:46.860 --> 1:29:49.500\n which we used for our dissociation experiments\n\n1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:50.660\n that I was mentioning,\n\n1:29:50.660 --> 1:29:55.020\n or you have a psychedelic LSD or DMT\n\n1:29:55.020 --> 1:29:57.900\n for this altered perceptual state,\n\n1:29:57.900 --> 1:30:00.620\n if you give either of those,\n\n1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:03.020\n these change everything across the brain, okay?\n\n1:30:03.020 --> 1:30:06.060\n So just the fact that you maybe give them to a mouse,\n\n1:30:06.060 --> 1:30:08.060\n let's say, or eventually to a human,\n\n1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:13.660\n you won't know yet which cells to home in on\n\n1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:17.180\n as the causal players in all this\n\n1:30:17.180 --> 1:30:19.380\n just by recording the activity.\n\n1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:21.900\n But then what we found is that optogenetics\n\n1:30:21.900 --> 1:30:23.780\n providing a causal pattern of activity\n\n1:30:23.780 --> 1:30:28.020\n guided by what you see can let you test hypotheses.\n\n1:30:28.020 --> 1:30:31.180\n And we saw this rhythm with ketamine and PCP\n\n1:30:31.180 --> 1:30:33.980\n for dissociation, and then we said, okay,\n\n1:30:33.980 --> 1:30:35.860\n let's test what's causal.\n\n1:30:35.860 --> 1:30:38.100\n We came in and provided that rhythm.\n\n1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:39.500\n We tried a few different things,\n\n1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:41.900\n but only one of the causal tests we tried\n\n1:30:41.900 --> 1:30:45.100\n actually caused the behavioral dissociation.\n\n1:30:45.100 --> 1:30:47.260\n And so that's how we home in on what actually matters.\n\n1:30:47.260 --> 1:30:49.220\n And is it repeatable once you see the causality?\n\n1:30:49.220 --> 1:30:51.260\n So like that's one definition of causality\n\n1:30:51.260 --> 1:30:55.100\n is like you try and it repeats across different mice\n\n1:30:55.100 --> 1:30:55.980\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:30:55.980 --> 1:30:56.820\n Exactly.\n\n1:30:58.100 --> 1:30:59.940\n And so you could do that for DMT.\n\n1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:02.140\n You could do that for the really fascinating\n\n1:31:02.140 --> 1:31:06.780\n mind expanding, thank you, thank you.\n\n1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:08.380\n So the meme for people just listening,\n\n1:31:08.380 --> 1:31:10.140\n this is again another disagreement\n\n1:31:10.140 --> 1:31:13.460\n between Freud and Carl Jung.\n\n1:31:13.460 --> 1:31:15.100\n Religion and spirituality.\n\n1:31:15.100 --> 1:31:18.900\n This is the, I guess the ring scene from Lord of the Rings.\n\n1:31:18.900 --> 1:31:20.820\n Religion and spirituality, Freud says,\n\n1:31:20.820 --> 1:31:23.460\n cast it into the fire, destroy it.\n\n1:31:23.460 --> 1:31:25.260\n Carl Jung says, no.\n\n1:31:25.260 --> 1:31:26.580\n So for people who don't know,\n\n1:31:26.580 --> 1:31:31.580\n Sergei is the Slavic Lord of the Meme.\n\n1:31:31.580 --> 1:31:33.780\n Thank you, I appreciate that.\n\n1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:34.700\n So what we're talking about,\n\n1:31:34.700 --> 1:31:36.700\n so there is, I mean, I think a connection\n\n1:31:36.700 --> 1:31:38.540\n between DMT and religious experiences\n\n1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:40.340\n are some of these psychedelics.\n\n1:31:40.340 --> 1:31:41.860\n Do you think it's possible to\n\n1:31:44.020 --> 1:31:47.300\n sort of stimulate religious experiences?\n\n1:31:47.300 --> 1:31:50.060\n And so religious experiences are one of the most\n\n1:31:50.060 --> 1:31:52.580\n deep kind of experiences.\n\n1:31:52.580 --> 1:31:57.100\n And so here you could first understand\n\n1:31:57.100 --> 1:32:00.060\n where they originate, how they propagate\n\n1:32:00.060 --> 1:32:02.900\n through the brain, and then to stimulate them.\n\n1:32:05.020 --> 1:32:06.740\n And so this is, and these can happen\n\n1:32:06.740 --> 1:32:09.660\n in people who had no predisposition.\n\n1:32:10.940 --> 1:32:15.940\n People who are as agnostic or atheistic as you'd like,\n\n1:32:15.940 --> 1:32:17.700\n they can have these, they can feel connected\n\n1:32:17.700 --> 1:32:20.140\n to God in these states.\n\n1:32:20.140 --> 1:32:21.980\n Now, to be clear, I'm not advocating these.\n\n1:32:21.980 --> 1:32:24.740\n We don't know what's safe in human beings,\n\n1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:26.940\n but we definitely have not yet.\n\n1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:29.540\n But we definitely can do these experiments in mice,\n\n1:32:29.540 --> 1:32:32.300\n and that was already very productive\n\n1:32:32.300 --> 1:32:33.700\n in understanding dissociation.\n\n1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:37.340\n So we can already imagine making headway on these methods.\n\n1:32:37.340 --> 1:32:39.580\n And then I had a, and this does map\n\n1:32:39.580 --> 1:32:42.980\n onto the non psychedelic human experience.\n\n1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:45.740\n I had a patient who was actually described\n\n1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:47.300\n in the book Projections.\n\n1:32:47.300 --> 1:32:49.740\n This was the patient that's in the mania chapter,\n\n1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:51.620\n the bipolar chapter.\n\n1:32:51.620 --> 1:32:56.340\n Here was a guy who had never had a psychiatric illness\n\n1:32:56.340 --> 1:32:57.380\n or symptom in his life.\n\n1:32:57.380 --> 1:33:00.540\n He was a retirement age gentleman,\n\n1:33:00.540 --> 1:33:02.900\n and nobody in his family either.\n\n1:33:02.900 --> 1:33:05.020\n So no family history, no personal history\n\n1:33:05.020 --> 1:33:07.260\n of any psychiatric illness, and he'd never been religious,\n\n1:33:07.260 --> 1:33:08.820\n particularly before either.\n\n1:33:08.820 --> 1:33:13.340\n Certainly no passionate type of religion.\n\n1:33:13.340 --> 1:33:15.900\n But he, not through any psychedelic or drug,\n\n1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:18.060\n he had a stressful experience,\n\n1:33:18.060 --> 1:33:21.660\n actually a post 9 11 change in how he was thinking.\n\n1:33:21.660 --> 1:33:24.900\n And he was pushed into a mania, a manic state,\n\n1:33:24.900 --> 1:33:26.780\n revealing that he had bipolar,\n\n1:33:26.780 --> 1:33:29.620\n never before known in this case, in this person.\n\n1:33:30.700 --> 1:33:33.940\n And his mania, his elevated state in bipolar\n\n1:33:33.940 --> 1:33:37.100\n included this profound religiosity,\n\n1:33:37.100 --> 1:33:38.260\n which he had never had before.\n\n1:33:38.260 --> 1:33:43.260\n And he was preaching in a elevated,\n\n1:33:44.180 --> 1:33:46.140\n vigorous way to his family.\n\n1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:50.020\n And so this state can be created in people\n\n1:33:50.020 --> 1:33:52.540\n even late in life who had no predisposition for it\n\n1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:54.980\n and even without a neurochemical.\n\n1:33:54.980 --> 1:33:59.980\n So the causality of that is very interesting to explore.\n\n1:34:00.740 --> 1:34:05.740\n How did the manic state unleash this religiosity?\n\n1:34:05.900 --> 1:34:08.580\n But you see that in other realms of psychiatry too.\n\n1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:11.660\n OCD can manifest as religiosity also.\n\n1:34:11.660 --> 1:34:13.780\n You can take people who never really had\n\n1:34:13.780 --> 1:34:18.500\n a religion, never played a powerful role in their life,\n\n1:34:18.500 --> 1:34:21.120\n but then when their obsessive compulsive symptoms\n\n1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:23.180\n become severe, they can manifest in this.\n\n1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:26.340\n I think I'm in that group, so I'm a bit OCD.\n\n1:34:26.340 --> 1:34:29.740\n We have, I think this is subreddits,\n\n1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:32.860\n when there's oddly satisfying things.\n\n1:34:32.860 --> 1:34:35.980\n So there's certain things that are really satisfying\n\n1:34:35.980 --> 1:34:39.620\n to my OCD, in my mild OCD.\n\n1:34:39.620 --> 1:34:41.980\n I think it's pretty much a religious experience.\n\n1:34:41.980 --> 1:34:45.900\n So I understand that if it's not direct,\n\n1:34:45.900 --> 1:34:48.360\n it's at least rhymes.\n\n1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:51.900\n So maybe can you speak to the,\n\n1:34:51.900 --> 1:34:54.740\n Sergei's probably desperately scrambling\n\n1:34:54.740 --> 1:34:57.020\n to pull up oddly satisfying, thank you.\n\n1:34:57.020 --> 1:34:58.300\n People can check it out themselves.\n\n1:34:58.300 --> 1:35:01.740\n It is, as the subreddit promises, oddly satisfying.\n\n1:35:03.020 --> 1:35:08.020\n Can we talk about bipolar and maybe depression?\n\n1:35:08.020 --> 1:35:11.340\n Well, let's talk about, I mean, I don't know if there's\n\n1:35:11.340 --> 1:35:13.900\n a nice way to discuss the differences\n\n1:35:13.900 --> 1:35:17.660\n in the full landscape of suffering that's here,\n\n1:35:17.660 --> 1:35:20.080\n but maybe what is depression?\n\n1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:23.240\n And what are the types of depression?\n\n1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:28.240\n What kind of depression have you seen and experienced\n\n1:35:28.380 --> 1:35:31.300\n and researched and how can people overcome it?\n\n1:35:31.300 --> 1:35:33.560\n How can humans overcome it and deal with it,\n\n1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:35.020\n live with it and overcome it?\n\n1:35:36.300 --> 1:35:38.940\n So this is my clinical specialty.\n\n1:35:38.940 --> 1:35:42.020\n I see patients in my outpatient clinical work\n\n1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:44.420\n with treatment resistant depression.\n\n1:35:44.420 --> 1:35:48.500\n So very hard to treat severe illness\n\n1:35:48.500 --> 1:35:51.580\n where medications haven't been working.\n\n1:35:51.580 --> 1:35:54.620\n I also see patients with autism spectrum disorders.\n\n1:35:54.620 --> 1:35:58.540\n These are my two clinical focal areas,\n\n1:35:58.540 --> 1:36:02.580\n but then I do emergency room work as well.\n\n1:36:02.580 --> 1:36:06.140\n But the depression, why do I focus on that?\n\n1:36:06.140 --> 1:36:11.140\n It's so, one feels tantalizingly close to helping\n\n1:36:13.220 --> 1:36:16.860\n these people who are suffering so deeply.\n\n1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:20.660\n And that's why I focused on it is these are people who,\n\n1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:23.000\n there may not even be anything situational\n\n1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.460\n that's difficult or challenging in their life.\n\n1:36:25.460 --> 1:36:28.120\n You can have people who seem to have everything\n\n1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:28.960\n that you would want.\n\n1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:30.800\n Every objective measure of their life is fine,\n\n1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:35.800\n yet they can be just hit with this unstoppable hopelessness\n\n1:36:41.180 --> 1:36:43.280\n and inability to see into the future,\n\n1:36:44.380 --> 1:36:47.500\n a discounting of the value of their own action.\n\n1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:50.980\n Anything they can imagine themselves doing seems worthless\n\n1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:54.860\n or they are unable to enjoy things.\n\n1:36:54.860 --> 1:36:56.420\n We call this anhedonia.\n\n1:36:56.420 --> 1:36:59.580\n There's no reward, no pleasure, not in food,\n\n1:36:59.580 --> 1:37:02.180\n social interaction, movies, books,\n\n1:37:02.180 --> 1:37:05.820\n anything that they would enjoy, positivity gone.\n\n1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:09.220\n They can have a profound negative internal state,\n\n1:37:09.220 --> 1:37:13.100\n psychic pain, and these things can seem,\n\n1:37:13.100 --> 1:37:16.900\n and in the severe cases, are inescapable.\n\n1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:19.580\n So what is going on?\n\n1:37:19.580 --> 1:37:23.380\n Why is this state part of human existence?\n\n1:37:23.380 --> 1:37:27.620\n It's got a strong biological, genetic link, we know that.\n\n1:37:27.620 --> 1:37:29.780\n It's been linked to certain genes,\n\n1:37:29.780 --> 1:37:33.020\n certain regions of the chromosomes, and twin studies.\n\n1:37:33.020 --> 1:37:34.820\n There's a clear genetic link.\n\n1:37:35.700 --> 1:37:37.740\n It doesn't explain everything, but it's a big part of it.\n\n1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:39.900\n Genetics are a strong contributor.\n\n1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:44.500\n And although you can have depression\n\n1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.740\n without anything terrible going on in your life,\n\n1:37:46.740 --> 1:37:50.620\n the symptoms can be made worse by stressors, by trauma.\n\n1:37:54.540 --> 1:37:55.860\n But at a very deep level,\n\n1:37:55.860 --> 1:37:58.220\n there's nothing we can measure in a person objectively,\n\n1:37:58.220 --> 1:38:01.700\n so we don't have, there's not a known chemical,\n\n1:38:01.700 --> 1:38:04.300\n not a known structure that's different,\n\n1:38:04.300 --> 1:38:06.180\n not a known brain activity pattern\n\n1:38:06.180 --> 1:38:08.220\n that we can pick up with EEG.\n\n1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:09.740\n A lot of people are exploring this,\n\n1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:11.540\n but right now we have no objective measures.\n\n1:38:11.540 --> 1:38:15.500\n All we do is talk to people and we elicit these symptoms.\n\n1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:20.500\n We explore them, distinguish them from other possible causes,\n\n1:38:20.940 --> 1:38:22.540\n and then what do we do?\n\n1:38:22.540 --> 1:38:24.900\n Well, we have a lot of things that we can do.\n\n1:38:24.900 --> 1:38:27.340\n Well, we have a range of treatments.\n\n1:38:27.340 --> 1:38:30.420\n We have medications that can help people,\n\n1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:32.260\n do help people, but not everybody.\n\n1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:34.260\n And if they don't work,\n\n1:38:34.260 --> 1:38:36.700\n then we can go to brain stimulation methods.\n\n1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:39.580\n We can do things even like electroconvulsive therapy,\n\n1:38:39.580 --> 1:38:42.340\n which is very effective,\n\n1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:45.860\n but it's sort of the final thing we go to in the end.\n\n1:38:47.060 --> 1:38:49.260\n And so we have treatments.\n\n1:38:49.260 --> 1:38:52.100\n They work for some people.\n\n1:38:52.100 --> 1:38:53.500\n They don't do everything we'd like.\n\n1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:56.620\n But here's the problem is at a very deep level,\n\n1:38:56.620 --> 1:38:59.500\n we don't understand really what's going on in the brain.\n\n1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:02.260\n We don't have a physical interpretation of the problem.\n\n1:39:03.140 --> 1:39:04.740\n We have all these symptoms,\n\n1:39:04.740 --> 1:39:07.740\n but we can't yet point to a set of cells\n\n1:39:07.740 --> 1:39:10.480\n or a set of circuits or an activity pattern\n\n1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:12.180\n that is causing major depression,\n\n1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:14.600\n this disease state per se in human beings.\n\n1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:17.780\n Why do you think you can't yet\n\n1:39:17.780 --> 1:39:19.300\n from an optogenetics perspective?\n\n1:39:19.300 --> 1:39:22.180\n Is it because there's so many possible causes?\n\n1:39:22.180 --> 1:39:24.940\n Is it so many things involved?\n\n1:39:24.940 --> 1:39:27.540\n So I think the answer is there are many things involved\n\n1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:30.660\n and all these different symptoms that I've mentioned,\n\n1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:32.900\n those we can study and those we can fix,\n\n1:39:32.900 --> 1:39:34.580\n the individual symptoms.\n\n1:39:34.580 --> 1:39:37.200\n And we can do this in animals to be clear.\n\n1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:39.060\n So in a mouse, for example,\n\n1:39:39.060 --> 1:39:42.840\n we can instantaneously and precisely\n\n1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:46.500\n turn up or down the motivation of an animal\n\n1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:48.100\n to overcome a challenge.\n\n1:39:48.100 --> 1:39:50.300\n We can turn up or down its ability\n\n1:39:50.300 --> 1:39:54.500\n to be motivated by, or we think experience reward\n\n1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:58.420\n from situations or actions.\n\n1:39:59.260 --> 1:40:01.620\n We can increase its apparent energy level,\n\n1:40:03.740 --> 1:40:06.240\n its drive to meet challenges.\n\n1:40:07.260 --> 1:40:10.180\n We can turn up or down social interaction.\n\n1:40:10.180 --> 1:40:12.340\n All these individual features of depression,\n\n1:40:12.340 --> 1:40:17.220\n individual symptoms, we now can point to exact projections\n\n1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:20.740\n and cells that are causal in mediating these.\n\n1:40:20.740 --> 1:40:24.760\n But we don't know is why all these different symptoms\n\n1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:27.500\n show up together in major depression\n\n1:40:27.500 --> 1:40:29.060\n and the human disease syndrome.\n\n1:40:29.060 --> 1:40:30.640\n And that's the mystery.\n\n1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:33.980\n It's sort of, in other fields of medicine,\n\n1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:35.460\n someone with congestive heart failure\n\n1:40:35.460 --> 1:40:36.740\n who comes into the clinic,\n\n1:40:36.740 --> 1:40:38.060\n they have very different symptoms.\n\n1:40:38.060 --> 1:40:41.140\n They have shortness of breath and they have swollen feet.\n\n1:40:42.100 --> 1:40:46.260\n Couldn't be two more different across the body\n\n1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:47.780\n sets of symptoms.\n\n1:40:47.780 --> 1:40:49.780\n Neither one obviously related to the heart,\n\n1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:50.820\n but they're both happening\n\n1:40:50.820 --> 1:40:53.060\n because the heart is not working as a pump, okay?\n\n1:40:53.060 --> 1:40:56.240\n And now, thankfully in cardiology,\n\n1:40:57.140 --> 1:40:59.900\n we understand these disparate symptoms\n\n1:40:59.900 --> 1:41:03.620\n that seem totally unrelated can be completely understood\n\n1:41:03.620 --> 1:41:05.780\n because there's an altered pump action of the heart.\n\n1:41:05.780 --> 1:41:10.340\n That's what we are hoping for in psychiatry\n\n1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:13.620\n and in the study of depression or any disease.\n\n1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:14.580\n These different symptoms,\n\n1:41:14.580 --> 1:41:18.840\n the inability to enjoy things, the hopelessness.\n\n1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:22.620\n What's the unifying principle?\n\n1:41:22.620 --> 1:41:23.460\n Yeah, unifying.\n\n1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:26.780\n I mean, is there some truth to that Tolstoy quote\n\n1:41:26.780 --> 1:41:28.820\n that all happy families are alike\n\n1:41:28.820 --> 1:41:31.740\n and each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way?\n\n1:41:31.740 --> 1:41:36.460\n So basically, I mean, this is the human condition.\n\n1:41:37.460 --> 1:41:42.260\n And basically, the physicists long to find\n\n1:41:42.260 --> 1:41:47.180\n a theory of everything, isn't understanding depression\n\n1:41:47.180 --> 1:41:51.460\n essentially require you to really have\n\n1:41:51.460 --> 1:41:53.900\n the big theory of everything for the human mind?\n\n1:41:55.380 --> 1:41:58.360\n I think we, it would certainly be nice to have that,\n\n1:41:58.360 --> 1:41:59.700\n a theory of everything.\n\n1:41:59.700 --> 1:42:00.720\n Don't get me wrong.\n\n1:42:00.720 --> 1:42:01.560\n I don't think we need it.\n\n1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:05.260\n The understatement of the century, it would be nice.\n\n1:42:05.260 --> 1:42:07.780\n Well, it's also a good question if it's possible.\n\n1:42:07.780 --> 1:42:08.780\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:42:08.780 --> 1:42:11.940\n Well, that I have some thoughts on too.\n\n1:42:11.940 --> 1:42:14.900\n But to this specific question,\n\n1:42:14.900 --> 1:42:16.340\n I don't think we need a theory of everything.\n\n1:42:16.340 --> 1:42:20.380\n I think there will be unifying principles we can get to.\n\n1:42:20.380 --> 1:42:23.540\n But even shy of that, we can treat symptoms\n\n1:42:23.540 --> 1:42:24.640\n and that's a big step.\n\n1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:27.920\n And as you say, different unhappy families are different,\n\n1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:30.060\n different unhappy people are different.\n\n1:42:30.060 --> 1:42:31.740\n If we have somebody who comes to the clinic\n\n1:42:31.740 --> 1:42:34.700\n and I see someone with a profound anhedonia\n\n1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:36.360\n as one of their main symptoms,\n\n1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.100\n inability to enjoy things,\n\n1:42:38.100 --> 1:42:41.380\n and if I know based on optogenetics work and animal work\n\n1:42:41.380 --> 1:42:44.700\n that a particular medication can treat anhedonia,\n\n1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:47.340\n even if it doesn't fix major depression in everybody,\n\n1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:50.420\n if I treat that one symptom in that one person,\n\n1:42:50.420 --> 1:42:51.620\n that's a good thing.\n\n1:42:51.620 --> 1:42:55.300\n And so we don't need the theory of everything\n\n1:42:55.300 --> 1:42:58.420\n and we don't even need the unifying principle\n\n1:42:58.420 --> 1:43:01.620\n to help people with insights that come from optogenetics.\n\n1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:05.580\n How much does talking help for diagnosis\n\n1:43:05.580 --> 1:43:09.760\n and for treatment, would you say, for depression?\n\n1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:11.560\n It's a big part of what we do.\n\n1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:15.260\n Every good psychiatrist should be pretty adept\n\n1:43:15.260 --> 1:43:18.200\n in these verbal communications and talk therapy\n\n1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:20.020\n as part of what they do.\n\n1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:22.900\n I give medications, I deliver brain stimulation treatments,\n\n1:43:22.900 --> 1:43:26.340\n but a big, big part of everything I do with every patient\n\n1:43:26.340 --> 1:43:31.000\n is talk therapy because it works so well together\n\n1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.300\n with these other modalities.\n\n1:43:33.300 --> 1:43:36.180\n Even alone, it can help people with moderate\n\n1:43:36.180 --> 1:43:39.980\n or mild depression by itself.\n\n1:43:39.980 --> 1:43:41.580\n People with severe depression,\n\n1:43:41.580 --> 1:43:46.260\n people with other psychiatric illnesses that are severe,\n\n1:43:46.260 --> 1:43:47.780\n you don't wanna do talk therapy alone,\n\n1:43:47.780 --> 1:43:48.860\n that's not gonna do it.\n\n1:43:48.860 --> 1:43:52.220\n But it still is crucial to do together with the others.\n\n1:43:52.220 --> 1:43:56.700\n And it's critical because it's part of how\n\n1:43:56.700 --> 1:44:01.300\n you reshape cognitions, complex activity patterns,\n\n1:44:01.300 --> 1:44:03.580\n and you won't get to that with a medication\n\n1:44:03.580 --> 1:44:05.380\n or a brain stimulation treatment.\n\n1:44:05.380 --> 1:44:07.780\n Do you have advice for people who suffer\n\n1:44:07.780 --> 1:44:12.660\n from mild forms of depression or feel as they might,\n\n1:44:12.660 --> 1:44:14.980\n both for those people, and do you have advice\n\n1:44:14.980 --> 1:44:19.480\n for people who love the people who suffer\n\n1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:22.060\n from depression and want to help?\n\n1:44:22.060 --> 1:44:26.340\n Yeah, one of the incredibly frustrating things\n\n1:44:26.340 --> 1:44:30.620\n about depression is the very nature of it makes it hard\n\n1:44:30.620 --> 1:44:34.220\n for the people who suffer to get treatment\n\n1:44:34.220 --> 1:44:35.740\n because they're hopeless,\n\n1:44:35.740 --> 1:44:37.460\n so they don't think treatment will help.\n\n1:44:37.460 --> 1:44:40.540\n They have low energy, so they're not motivated\n\n1:44:40.540 --> 1:44:42.580\n to participate in treatment in many cases.\n\n1:44:43.980 --> 1:44:46.500\n Sometimes they're actively suicidal.\n\n1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:48.300\n That certainly doesn't help.\n\n1:44:48.300 --> 1:44:53.300\n They have all these things that seem to prevent treatment\n\n1:44:53.780 --> 1:44:54.620\n from being effective.\n\n1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:56.340\n So the loved ones, that's where the loved ones\n\n1:44:56.340 --> 1:44:59.780\n are so important, is helping them overcome these barriers\n\n1:44:59.780 --> 1:45:04.780\n to treatment, the motivation, the safety, and the insight.\n\n1:45:05.100 --> 1:45:09.460\n That's critical, and particularly for the severe cases.\n\n1:45:09.460 --> 1:45:13.780\n For the mild cases, where people still have some insight\n\n1:45:13.780 --> 1:45:16.580\n and motivation and energy to get something done,\n\n1:45:17.420 --> 1:45:19.200\n there are many things you can do.\n\n1:45:20.740 --> 1:45:25.500\n Exercise is extremely important in mood maintenance.\n\n1:45:25.500 --> 1:45:28.260\n Regulation of sleep and getting sufficient\n\n1:45:28.260 --> 1:45:31.140\n and regular enough sleep is very important.\n\n1:45:31.140 --> 1:45:33.540\n And talk therapy can be helpful in those mild\n\n1:45:33.540 --> 1:45:36.380\n or moderate cases, just looking at cognitions,\n\n1:45:36.380 --> 1:45:40.700\n looking at patterns of thought that people\n\n1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:43.500\n may have fallen into, where they catastrophize,\n\n1:45:43.500 --> 1:45:47.640\n where they spiral from small things into big things.\n\n1:45:49.220 --> 1:45:52.640\n A little bit of talk therapy, 10, 12 sessions,\n\n1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:55.680\n can help people identify those patterns they may have\n\n1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:00.680\n in themselves that are taking occasional negative thoughts,\n\n1:46:00.980 --> 1:46:03.820\n which everybody has, and magnifying those\n\n1:46:03.820 --> 1:46:06.980\n into more persistent negative states.\n\n1:46:08.220 --> 1:46:10.780\n If you work at this, and it's kind of like homework,\n\n1:46:10.780 --> 1:46:14.060\n this is what we call cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:15.620\n It's very structured, very organized.\n\n1:46:15.620 --> 1:46:16.460\n You work hard.\n\n1:46:16.460 --> 1:46:18.100\n It requires insight and motivation,\n\n1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:20.340\n and you have to be motivated.\n\n1:46:20.340 --> 1:46:23.380\n But if you are, then you can identify these triggers\n\n1:46:23.380 --> 1:46:25.300\n that send you down particular pathways.\n\n1:46:25.300 --> 1:46:27.100\n And work to intercept them.\n\n1:46:27.100 --> 1:46:30.500\n And that is amazingly very effective\n\n1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:32.340\n in mild to moderate cases.\n\n1:46:32.340 --> 1:46:35.460\n So you basically have to train yourself\n\n1:46:35.460 --> 1:46:40.300\n to see the world as a collection of triggers.\n\n1:46:40.300 --> 1:46:44.900\n And you have to first understand, like collect the data,\n\n1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:47.200\n like basically see every experience\n\n1:46:48.780 --> 1:46:53.780\n as a thing that creates a follow on emotion, a feeling.\n\n1:46:53.780 --> 1:46:58.780\n And like, I've learned this, you know, like on social media,\n\n1:47:00.500 --> 1:47:04.380\n where like early on, you know, like all of us,\n\n1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:08.260\n you know, I'll say something,\n\n1:47:08.260 --> 1:47:12.820\n I kind of respond to negativity with negativity.\n\n1:47:12.820 --> 1:47:16.380\n And then you observe the results of that.\n\n1:47:16.380 --> 1:47:21.300\n And then over time, you think, wait a minute.\n\n1:47:21.300 --> 1:47:24.020\n This thing that I've been doing where\n\n1:47:24.020 --> 1:47:27.540\n when somebody says, you suck, and you say, no, you suck.\n\n1:47:29.020 --> 1:47:32.980\n That never produces the result you thought it might.\n\n1:47:32.980 --> 1:47:37.980\n And so might not want to just, don't say you suck back.\n\n1:47:38.420 --> 1:47:41.640\n And I do this through a lot of things in life.\n\n1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:46.460\n I'm very fortunate to not suffer from depression,\n\n1:47:46.460 --> 1:47:51.460\n but first of all, I have had and have people in my life\n\n1:47:51.980 --> 1:47:56.980\n who do, and also, you know, all of us have depression\n\n1:47:57.060 --> 1:48:00.740\n who don't suffer from depression, have depression out.\n\n1:48:00.740 --> 1:48:03.140\n Like, it's always knocking on the door.\n\n1:48:03.140 --> 1:48:04.380\n Right, yeah.\n\n1:48:04.380 --> 1:48:09.380\n And so you have mild, I mean,\n\n1:48:09.620 --> 1:48:14.280\n if you're very careless with the triggers all around you,\n\n1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:17.960\n then you're just, I think all of us have the capacity\n\n1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:22.300\n to really suffer from that kind of chemical\n\n1:48:22.300 --> 1:48:26.240\n or psychological or philosophical existential crisis.\n\n1:48:27.580 --> 1:48:30.220\n But then it raises a question, why are we built this way?\n\n1:48:30.220 --> 1:48:32.700\n It seems like it doesn't make sense, right?\n\n1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:34.720\n And here's where some of us thinking about\n\n1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:38.940\n where we came from as the human family\n\n1:48:38.940 --> 1:48:40.500\n is kind of interesting.\n\n1:48:40.500 --> 1:48:44.420\n It doesn't make sense that somewhere on that spectrum\n\n1:48:45.620 --> 1:48:48.200\n that it's good to detect that there's an array\n\n1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:51.900\n of adverse forces out there in the world right now\n\n1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:56.900\n at this moment and to withdraw, to hunker down,\n\n1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:02.500\n to not fight, not strive, not try to meet the challenge\n\n1:49:02.500 --> 1:49:06.560\n and outweigh these negative forces\n\n1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:08.220\n that are present out there.\n\n1:49:08.220 --> 1:49:13.220\n And that makes a lot of sense, and all animals\n\n1:49:13.220 --> 1:49:15.940\n that have been studied in one form or another show this.\n\n1:49:15.940 --> 1:49:18.260\n Even the worm that I mentioned earlier,\n\n1:49:18.260 --> 1:49:22.360\n C. elegans with 302 neurons, it can effectively give up\n\n1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:24.020\n in challenging situations.\n\n1:49:24.020 --> 1:49:25.900\n We've done this with zebrafish,\n\n1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:28.420\n tiny little transparent fish.\n\n1:49:28.420 --> 1:49:30.340\n You can give them a challenging situation\n\n1:49:30.340 --> 1:49:33.980\n and they will give up, but then if you stimulate\n\n1:49:33.980 --> 1:49:37.180\n a couple very specific brain regions in particular ways,\n\n1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:40.460\n you can motivate them to overcome the challenge.\n\n1:49:40.460 --> 1:49:41.780\n And if you inhibit those regions,\n\n1:49:41.780 --> 1:49:44.660\n they give up much more easily than they would otherwise.\n\n1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:47.220\n You can do this in mice, you can do this in rats.\n\n1:49:47.220 --> 1:49:49.880\n So this is an ancestral conserve pattern\n\n1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:53.980\n to detect that things are pretty bad out there\n\n1:49:54.940 --> 1:49:58.660\n and to conserve energy, to hunker down,\n\n1:49:58.660 --> 1:50:00.260\n to wait out the storm.\n\n1:50:00.260 --> 1:50:04.300\n So as you, unfortunately, many of our maladies\n\n1:50:04.300 --> 1:50:09.300\n have useful roots that contribute to our survival.\n\n1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:14.900\n So both depression and motivation have uses.\n\n1:50:14.900 --> 1:50:18.540\n And sometimes it's nice to just shut the hell up\n\n1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:22.180\n and huddle with the penguins versus,\n\n1:50:22.180 --> 1:50:24.940\n for some unknown reason, venture out on your own\n\n1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:28.060\n into the mountains like a David Goggins type character.\n\n1:50:28.060 --> 1:50:31.660\n So what's the difference to you between,\n\n1:50:31.660 --> 1:50:36.260\n you see patients, between sort of rigorous psychoanalysis?\n\n1:50:38.780 --> 1:50:41.100\n I don't know if you consider talk therapy\n\n1:50:41.100 --> 1:50:42.740\n and psychoanalysis, are they neighbors,\n\n1:50:42.740 --> 1:50:43.740\n are they overlapping?\n\n1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:45.220\n They're neighbors.\n\n1:50:45.220 --> 1:50:49.140\n Psychoanalysis is, they're relatively,\n\n1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:51.940\n it's not nearly done as much as the talk therapy,\n\n1:50:51.940 --> 1:50:54.340\n like the cognitive behavioral therapy I mentioned.\n\n1:50:56.540 --> 1:51:00.540\n The psychoanalysis is a little more niche now\n\n1:51:00.540 --> 1:51:04.020\n and partly because it's not, the data isn't,\n\n1:51:05.540 --> 1:51:09.060\n in terms of actual treatment of actual therapeutic effects,\n\n1:51:09.060 --> 1:51:13.020\n data not as supportive as for cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:15.940\n But it's still interesting as for insight,\n\n1:51:15.940 --> 1:51:17.500\n people, a lot of people still do it\n\n1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:19.700\n to gain insight into themselves.\n\n1:51:19.700 --> 1:51:23.140\n And in general, it's a good sort of conversation starter.\n\n1:51:23.140 --> 1:51:27.460\n Those methods, they're good for getting things out.\n\n1:51:27.460 --> 1:51:30.300\n We don't focus on dreams typically these days\n\n1:51:30.300 --> 1:51:32.540\n in psychiatry, but they're great conversation starters.\n\n1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:35.500\n They're great ways to get things out if people have,\n\n1:51:37.140 --> 1:51:39.020\n and so we like to use those methods\n\n1:51:39.020 --> 1:51:41.060\n just to get the ball rolling sometimes,\n\n1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:42.900\n get people to open up a little bit.\n\n1:51:42.900 --> 1:51:45.940\n But the actual treatment tends not to involve\n\n1:51:45.940 --> 1:51:49.860\n these psychoanalytic approaches where you are really\n\n1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:53.620\n probing the unconscious mind and its manifestation\n\n1:51:53.620 --> 1:51:58.020\n through dreams, for example, as the goal.\n\n1:51:58.020 --> 1:51:59.180\n That's not the goal.\n\n1:51:59.180 --> 1:52:01.540\n Modern talk therapy, we're really focusing on treatment,\n\n1:52:01.540 --> 1:52:03.020\n how to get people to feel better.\n\n1:52:03.020 --> 1:52:05.060\n See, I use that as a conversation opener,\n\n1:52:05.060 --> 1:52:09.780\n the Freudian thing where I try to delve at a bar\n\n1:52:09.780 --> 1:52:13.180\n of the deep sexual desires in a person's subconscious\n\n1:52:13.180 --> 1:52:16.020\n and I find that opens up possibilities very quickly.\n\n1:52:16.020 --> 1:52:20.340\n Now, what's, I mean, this is a silly sounding question,\n\n1:52:20.340 --> 1:52:22.180\n but what's the difference between\n\n1:52:22.180 --> 1:52:25.580\n cognitive behavioral therapy and conversation?\n\n1:52:25.580 --> 1:52:30.340\n So, because I personally, as a fan of conversations,\n\n1:52:30.340 --> 1:52:32.740\n as a fan of just, I like listening to podcasts\n\n1:52:34.060 --> 1:52:36.020\n versus like audio book, I like both,\n\n1:52:36.020 --> 1:52:38.580\n but they're very different and I like conversation.\n\n1:52:38.580 --> 1:52:41.180\n I like, it makes me personally very anxious,\n\n1:52:41.180 --> 1:52:45.020\n so I like to be the listener, like a third wheel,\n\n1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:47.660\n like overhearing a conversation kind of thing,\n\n1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:51.140\n but it's a really powerful method for humans\n\n1:52:51.140 --> 1:52:54.340\n to explore each other's mind, just raw conversation.\n\n1:52:54.340 --> 1:52:58.260\n So, do you think it can be more productive\n\n1:52:58.260 --> 1:53:01.740\n to be very systematic about it or is conversation itself\n\n1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:04.700\n the art form of helping each other,\n\n1:53:04.700 --> 1:53:06.740\n understanding each other and helping each other?\n\n1:53:06.740 --> 1:53:08.580\n There are forms of talk therapy\n\n1:53:08.580 --> 1:53:10.940\n that are essentially conversational\n\n1:53:10.940 --> 1:53:13.460\n or they much more approach pure conversation.\n\n1:53:13.460 --> 1:53:17.100\n There's a befriending therapy,\n\n1:53:17.100 --> 1:53:18.460\n there's interpersonal therapy.\n\n1:53:18.460 --> 1:53:23.060\n These are approaches that are purely talk therapy,\n\n1:53:23.060 --> 1:53:25.580\n but they're not as structured\n\n1:53:25.580 --> 1:53:26.780\n as cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n1:53:26.780 --> 1:53:28.980\n Cognitive behavioral therapy is,\n\n1:53:28.980 --> 1:53:31.060\n there are manuals, there are guidelines.\n\n1:53:31.060 --> 1:53:33.700\n You can almost go through it in a very cookbooky way.\n\n1:53:33.700 --> 1:53:35.700\n There's homework that you get done.\n\n1:53:35.700 --> 1:53:38.700\n So, it's in its fullest form,\n\n1:53:38.700 --> 1:53:39.700\n it's very different from these\n\n1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:42.140\n more conversational strategies.\n\n1:53:42.140 --> 1:53:44.300\n But what's interesting is sometimes people compare them\n\n1:53:44.300 --> 1:53:47.820\n and so you'll see almost like randomized controlled studies\n\n1:53:49.540 --> 1:53:51.340\n comparing cognitive behavioral therapy\n\n1:53:51.340 --> 1:53:53.580\n with interpersonal therapy, for example.\n\n1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:56.180\n And they both can work and actually in some studies,\n\n1:53:56.180 --> 1:53:58.020\n they look comparable.\n\n1:53:59.180 --> 1:54:03.340\n So, to your point, conversation and insights\n\n1:54:03.340 --> 1:54:05.500\n that come from conversation, if done well,\n\n1:54:05.500 --> 1:54:09.060\n if done artfully, can be as powerful.\n\n1:54:09.060 --> 1:54:10.980\n This reminds me of Robin Williams.\n\n1:54:10.980 --> 1:54:13.980\n I have to ask you several questions here on that.\n\n1:54:13.980 --> 1:54:16.980\n But one of my favorite movies is Good Will Hunting.\n\n1:54:16.980 --> 1:54:19.420\n I don't know if you've seen it with Robin Williams.\n\n1:54:19.420 --> 1:54:21.940\n So, as a psychiatrist yourself,\n\n1:54:21.940 --> 1:54:25.620\n can you do a deep analysis of this other famous psychiatrist\n\n1:54:25.620 --> 1:54:29.020\n which is the movie character played by Robin Williams\n\n1:54:29.020 --> 1:54:30.700\n at Good Will Hunting?\n\n1:54:30.700 --> 1:54:33.260\n Is it just a caricature between a psychiatrist\n\n1:54:33.260 --> 1:54:35.340\n and patient relationship?\n\n1:54:35.340 --> 1:54:39.340\n Or is there something to you that was moving\n\n1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:41.220\n about his ability to connect\n\n1:54:41.220 --> 1:54:44.260\n to this obviously struggling young kid?\n\n1:54:45.140 --> 1:54:46.580\n I think you hit on the key thing there\n\n1:54:46.580 --> 1:54:48.820\n which is the depth of the connection.\n\n1:54:48.820 --> 1:54:53.820\n If there's too powerful a connection,\n\n1:54:55.580 --> 1:54:58.340\n that can impair therapy\n\n1:54:58.340 --> 1:55:01.140\n because it could impair open communication.\n\n1:55:01.140 --> 1:55:05.540\n If someone, if a patient has a, sees the role,\n\n1:55:05.540 --> 1:55:08.140\n sees the relationship in a particular way,\n\n1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:09.700\n like in a friendly way maybe,\n\n1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:14.420\n or like a parental child type way,\n\n1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:17.860\n that can cause problems because then what they choose\n\n1:55:17.860 --> 1:55:21.700\n to share, what they choose to bring up is selected\n\n1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:25.540\n to be appropriate for that view of the relationship.\n\n1:55:26.460 --> 1:55:31.100\n And so, I and many other talk therapists actually prefer\n\n1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:37.060\n not to let things get, not let the connection get that deep.\n\n1:55:37.500 --> 1:55:39.180\n You wanna have trust.\n\n1:55:39.180 --> 1:55:42.620\n You wanna have a therapeutic alliance, we sometimes call it.\n\n1:55:44.260 --> 1:55:47.180\n But it's got to be enough of a blank slate\n\n1:55:47.180 --> 1:55:50.820\n that the patient is not consciously\n\n1:55:50.820 --> 1:55:54.500\n or unconsciously constrained in what they choose to share.\n\n1:55:55.780 --> 1:56:00.780\n And so, great movie, great actors, all good,\n\n1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:06.300\n no complaints except realistically,\n\n1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:09.020\n the relationship should be a little more arm's length\n\n1:56:09.020 --> 1:56:09.860\n than that.\n\n1:56:11.220 --> 1:56:13.140\n Let's pretend this is real life.\n\n1:56:13.140 --> 1:56:16.900\n Sometimes can't you leave a little bit of yourself\n\n1:56:16.900 --> 1:56:18.540\n in the interaction with the patient?\n\n1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:20.540\n I mean, it's another human being.\n\n1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:22.420\n Yes, so there's a balance.\n\n1:56:22.420 --> 1:56:24.420\n And actually you do need some of it\n\n1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:28.820\n because let's say this person is having challenges,\n\n1:56:28.820 --> 1:56:30.740\n interpersonal challenges in their life.\n\n1:56:32.340 --> 1:56:35.060\n The best way to notice what those are\n\n1:56:36.500 --> 1:56:38.860\n and to identify them and to work with them\n\n1:56:39.740 --> 1:56:43.220\n is if you can elicit some of those problems\n\n1:56:43.220 --> 1:56:47.620\n in the office, in the therapeutic interaction.\n\n1:56:47.620 --> 1:56:49.980\n And this is really powerful.\n\n1:56:49.980 --> 1:56:54.420\n As long as you're alert to it, aware of it,\n\n1:56:54.420 --> 1:56:56.980\n and you don't let it go out of hand,\n\n1:56:56.980 --> 1:56:58.980\n this transference, we call it,\n\n1:56:58.980 --> 1:57:03.980\n is when you transfer in between\n\n1:57:04.700 --> 1:57:06.380\n the current therapeutic relationship\n\n1:57:06.380 --> 1:57:08.580\n and external relationships\n\n1:57:08.580 --> 1:57:10.700\n that the patient may have had with others.\n\n1:57:10.700 --> 1:57:12.860\n And so if the therapist starts to feel\n\n1:57:14.060 --> 1:57:17.940\n an inner feeling like anger, let's say.\n\n1:57:17.940 --> 1:57:18.940\n So let's say you have a patient\n\n1:57:18.940 --> 1:57:22.260\n who is stirring frustration in you\n\n1:57:22.260 --> 1:57:24.420\n or even in extreme cases, anger,\n\n1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:26.900\n the best thing for the therapist to do in that case\n\n1:57:26.900 --> 1:57:31.100\n is to recognize it and to realize\n\n1:57:31.100 --> 1:57:33.300\n that's probably being stirred by other people\n\n1:57:33.300 --> 1:57:34.860\n in the patient's life.\n\n1:57:34.860 --> 1:57:37.020\n And that could be the source of a lot of problems.\n\n1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:39.940\n And so instead of trying to wall it off,\n\n1:57:39.940 --> 1:57:42.020\n and say, oh, I shouldn't be feeling that,\n\n1:57:42.020 --> 1:57:44.300\n I better be a better therapist instead,\n\n1:57:44.300 --> 1:57:45.980\n and recognize it and use it,\n\n1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:48.260\n and help the patient that way.\n\n1:57:48.260 --> 1:57:49.620\n And so you've gotta be a human being.\n\n1:57:49.620 --> 1:57:52.060\n You've gotta be a person who feels.\n\n1:57:52.060 --> 1:57:53.660\n You've gotta be open.\n\n1:57:53.660 --> 1:57:56.540\n But be in control of it and be aware of it.\n\n1:57:56.540 --> 1:57:58.380\n If I may, I just wanna read,\n\n1:57:58.380 --> 1:58:00.020\n because it's one of my favorite scenes.\n\n1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:02.620\n Probably one of the greatest scenes,\n\n1:58:02.620 --> 1:58:04.540\n one of the greatest scenes in movie history\n\n1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:07.460\n because Robin Williams does a single take.\n\n1:58:08.540 --> 1:58:09.380\n Is that right?\n\n1:58:09.380 --> 1:58:10.220\n I didn't know that.\n\n1:58:10.220 --> 1:58:12.060\n So this is a very interesting interaction between them.\n\n1:58:12.060 --> 1:58:15.380\n So Will, and I'm sure this is a common interaction,\n\n1:58:17.380 --> 1:58:19.060\n maybe with a therapist and a patient,\n\n1:58:19.060 --> 1:58:21.300\n maybe with a father and son,\n\n1:58:21.300 --> 1:58:23.500\n where Will, the young character,\n\n1:58:23.500 --> 1:58:25.060\n the young, brilliant mathematician,\n\n1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:28.380\n and Sean is the therapist, the older therapist,\n\n1:58:28.380 --> 1:58:31.820\n where Will looks at a painting that Sean painted\n\n1:58:31.820 --> 1:58:35.940\n and then does a deep, critical analysis of the painting\n\n1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:40.580\n that basically describes pretending\n\n1:58:40.580 --> 1:58:43.420\n as if he can understand another human being completely\n\n1:58:43.420 --> 1:58:45.420\n by just looking at their painting.\n\n1:58:45.420 --> 1:58:48.100\n And then Sean gives this whole speech\n\n1:58:49.300 --> 1:58:52.340\n that contrasts sort of raw intelligence\n\n1:58:52.340 --> 1:58:54.300\n and the wisdom of experience.\n\n1:58:54.300 --> 1:58:56.860\n And Sean says, single take.\n\n1:58:56.860 --> 1:58:59.620\n He says, you've never been out of Boston, right?\n\n1:58:59.620 --> 1:59:01.260\n And Will says, nope.\n\n1:59:01.260 --> 1:59:03.660\n All this in a sexy Boston accent, by the way.\n\n1:59:03.660 --> 1:59:07.420\n And then Sean gives the speech.\n\n1:59:07.420 --> 1:59:08.820\n If I asked you about art,\n\n1:59:08.820 --> 1:59:10.340\n you'd probably give me the skinny\n\n1:59:10.340 --> 1:59:12.940\n and about every art book ever written.\n\n1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:15.700\n Michelangelo, you know a lot about him.\n\n1:59:15.700 --> 1:59:17.540\n Life's work, political aspirations,\n\n1:59:17.540 --> 1:59:19.700\n him and the Pope, sexual orientation,\n\n1:59:19.700 --> 1:59:21.380\n the whole works, right?\n\n1:59:21.380 --> 1:59:23.980\n But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like\n\n1:59:23.980 --> 1:59:26.060\n in the Sistine Chapel.\n\n1:59:26.060 --> 1:59:27.660\n You never actually stood there\n\n1:59:27.660 --> 1:59:31.460\n and looked up at that beautiful ceiling, seeing that.\n\n1:59:31.460 --> 1:59:32.780\n If I asked you about women,\n\n1:59:32.780 --> 1:59:34.860\n you'll probably give me a syllabus\n\n1:59:34.860 --> 1:59:36.700\n of your personal favorites.\n\n1:59:36.700 --> 1:59:40.220\n You may have even been laid a few times.\n\n1:59:40.220 --> 1:59:42.700\n The language here is just beautiful.\n\n1:59:42.700 --> 1:59:45.420\n But you can't tell me what it feels like\n\n1:59:45.420 --> 1:59:48.220\n to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy.\n\n1:59:49.100 --> 1:59:50.580\n You're a tough kid.\n\n1:59:50.580 --> 1:59:51.740\n If I asked you about war,\n\n1:59:51.740 --> 1:59:54.460\n you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right?\n\n1:59:54.460 --> 1:59:57.380\n Probably not, but let's say.\n\n1:59:57.380 --> 1:59:59.860\n Once more into the breach here, friends.\n\n1:59:59.860 --> 2:00:02.220\n But you've never been near one.\n\n2:00:02.220 --> 2:00:05.060\n You've never held your best friend's head on your lap\n\n2:00:05.060 --> 2:00:07.060\n and watched him gasp his last breath,\n\n2:00:07.060 --> 2:00:09.300\n looking to you for help.\n\n2:00:09.300 --> 2:00:11.420\n If I asked you about love,\n\n2:00:11.420 --> 2:00:13.300\n you'd probably quote me a sonnet.\n\n2:00:14.420 --> 2:00:16.140\n But you've never looked at a woman\n\n2:00:16.140 --> 2:00:18.540\n and be truly vulnerable,\n\n2:00:18.540 --> 2:00:21.780\n known someone who can level you with their eyes,\n\n2:00:21.780 --> 2:00:25.420\n feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you,\n\n2:00:25.420 --> 2:00:27.780\n who could rescue you from the depths of hell\n\n2:00:27.780 --> 2:00:32.340\n and you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel.\n\n2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:34.300\n To have that love for her,\n\n2:00:34.300 --> 2:00:38.340\n be there forever, through anything, through cancer.\n\n2:00:38.340 --> 2:00:40.260\n And you wouldn't know about sleeping,\n\n2:00:40.260 --> 2:00:42.620\n sitting up in a hospital room for two months,\n\n2:00:42.620 --> 2:00:46.260\n holding her hand because the doctors could see in your eyes\n\n2:00:46.260 --> 2:00:49.220\n the terms visiting hours don't apply to you.\n\n2:00:49.220 --> 2:00:51.260\n You don't know about real loss\n\n2:00:51.260 --> 2:00:55.180\n because that only occurs when you love something\n\n2:00:55.180 --> 2:00:57.860\n more than you love yourself.\n\n2:00:57.860 --> 2:01:01.860\n I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.\n\n2:01:01.860 --> 2:01:03.260\n I look at you.\n\n2:01:03.260 --> 2:01:05.700\n I don't see an intelligent, confident man.\n\n2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:08.900\n I see a cocky, scared, shitless kid.\n\n2:01:08.900 --> 2:01:10.380\n But you're a genius, Will.\n\n2:01:10.380 --> 2:01:12.060\n No one denies that.\n\n2:01:12.060 --> 2:01:14.820\n No one can possibly understand the depths of you.\n\n2:01:14.820 --> 2:01:16.700\n But you presume to know everything about me\n\n2:01:16.700 --> 2:01:18.740\n because you saw a painting of mine\n\n2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:21.660\n you ripped my fucking life apart.\n\n2:01:21.660 --> 2:01:23.860\n You're an orphan, right?\n\n2:01:23.860 --> 2:01:25.300\n Do you think I know the first thing\n\n2:01:25.300 --> 2:01:27.620\n about how hard your life has been,\n\n2:01:27.620 --> 2:01:31.740\n how you feel, who you are because I read Oliver Twist?\n\n2:01:31.740 --> 2:01:33.980\n Does that encapsulate you?\n\n2:01:33.980 --> 2:01:36.020\n Personally, I don't give a shit about all that\n\n2:01:36.020 --> 2:01:37.540\n because you know what?\n\n2:01:37.540 --> 2:01:39.220\n I can't learn anything from you\n\n2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:41.740\n that I can't read in some fucking book\n\n2:01:41.740 --> 2:01:45.260\n unless you want to talk about you, who you are.\n\n2:01:45.260 --> 2:01:47.540\n And I'm fascinated, I'm in.\n\n2:01:47.540 --> 2:01:50.380\n But you don't want to do that, do you, sport?\n\n2:01:50.380 --> 2:01:53.660\n You're terrified of what you might say.\n\n2:01:53.660 --> 2:01:55.820\n Your move, chief.\n\n2:01:55.820 --> 2:01:57.500\n Well done, sir, I know it's a movie.\n\n2:01:57.500 --> 2:01:58.820\n It's interesting, right?\n\n2:01:58.820 --> 2:02:00.140\n So some of that conversation\n\n2:02:00.140 --> 2:02:03.140\n is at some intellectual level, too.\n\n2:02:03.140 --> 2:02:06.060\n It's not just emotional, it's something,\n\n2:02:06.060 --> 2:02:10.700\n it's like, the reason I kind of connect with that is\n\n2:02:10.700 --> 2:02:14.300\n that's a lot of work for a therapist.\n\n2:02:14.300 --> 2:02:16.180\n Like, to really understand another,\n\n2:02:16.180 --> 2:02:19.520\n because he's, I mean, from, okay, I know this is fictional,\n\n2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:22.900\n but just, there's calculation happening.\n\n2:02:22.900 --> 2:02:26.020\n He deeply cares to say the words\n\n2:02:26.020 --> 2:02:27.960\n that the other person needs to hear,\n\n2:02:27.960 --> 2:02:32.620\n but also a little bit loses himself in the pride,\n\n2:02:32.620 --> 2:02:35.220\n but then catches himself again,\n\n2:02:35.220 --> 2:02:38.620\n switches from anger to connection.\n\n2:02:38.620 --> 2:02:39.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:02:39.500 --> 2:02:40.900\n A lot is brought up there.\n\n2:02:40.900 --> 2:02:42.900\n You're right, there has to be some emotion\n\n2:02:42.900 --> 2:02:46.140\n in the therapist to care enough to keep going,\n\n2:02:46.140 --> 2:02:51.140\n to keep probing, to open up as he's doing so, right?\n\n2:02:51.140 --> 2:02:53.940\n He revealed a lot about himself, his own vulnerabilities,\n\n2:02:53.940 --> 2:02:56.780\n but that gave him authenticity.\n\n2:02:56.780 --> 2:02:58.060\n He had to open himself up\n\n2:02:58.060 --> 2:03:01.780\n so that the kid would see the authenticity\n\n2:03:01.780 --> 2:03:03.800\n and open himself up in return.\n\n2:03:05.100 --> 2:03:10.020\n So how do you do that as a psychiatrist, as a therapist?\n\n2:03:10.020 --> 2:03:11.140\n You have to be careful.\n\n2:03:11.140 --> 2:03:13.740\n You don't wanna do too much,\n\n2:03:13.740 --> 2:03:17.540\n but opening up a little bit does help.\n\n2:03:17.540 --> 2:03:20.260\n It does create a chance.\n\n2:03:20.260 --> 2:03:21.420\n You're offering up something\n\n2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:24.740\n and that helps the patient come back in return,\n\n2:03:24.740 --> 2:03:28.740\n and it gives you that believability and authenticity.\n\n2:03:28.740 --> 2:03:31.380\n Do you pay the price for that, for opening it up?\n\n2:03:31.380 --> 2:03:32.900\n You can.\n\n2:03:32.900 --> 2:03:33.820\n You have a family.\n\n2:03:33.820 --> 2:03:38.220\n You have an incredibly difficult research.\n\n2:03:38.220 --> 2:03:40.380\n You're doing a lot of things in your world.\n\n2:03:40.380 --> 2:03:42.500\n I mean, it's the price you pay for like.\n\n2:03:43.900 --> 2:03:45.740\n Well, this was one of the terrifying things\n\n2:03:45.740 --> 2:03:50.100\n about writing the book was I do open up\n\n2:03:50.100 --> 2:03:52.620\n in a little bit about my own personal life,\n\n2:03:52.620 --> 2:03:53.820\n my own personal challenges,\n\n2:03:53.820 --> 2:03:55.540\n and that was a considered decision\n\n2:03:55.540 --> 2:04:00.540\n because I could have done the patient work\n\n2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:02.200\n and the science work\n\n2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:04.900\n and the history of the human family work\n\n2:04:04.900 --> 2:04:06.480\n and tied it all together,\n\n2:04:07.860 --> 2:04:12.860\n but it wasn't, and in an early draft, it was like that,\n\n2:04:13.260 --> 2:04:15.540\n but it wasn't real yet.\n\n2:04:15.540 --> 2:04:19.540\n It wasn't something that everybody could connect with,\n\n2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:22.180\n and I said, then I realized, look, if I'm gonna do this,\n\n2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:26.380\n I've gotta open up myself,\n\n2:04:26.380 --> 2:04:28.140\n and then people can connect with me\n\n2:04:28.140 --> 2:04:31.780\n and see what I'm really saying, and so I did,\n\n2:04:31.780 --> 2:04:36.780\n and that was not something that I'd gone in planning to do.\n\n2:04:37.500 --> 2:04:39.360\n In retrospect, I learned a lot about myself.\n\n2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:42.300\n It was actually really, I think, a good thing that I did,\n\n2:04:42.300 --> 2:04:43.820\n but it was scary.\n\n2:04:43.820 --> 2:04:48.820\n Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?\n\n2:04:51.300 --> 2:04:55.500\n You know, I had, things haven't always been easy,\n\n2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:57.300\n personally or professionally.\n\n2:04:57.300 --> 2:05:00.820\n I had moments, you know, I was effectively a single dad\n\n2:05:00.820 --> 2:05:03.180\n for a while, a number of years,\n\n2:05:03.180 --> 2:05:05.300\n and these came at probably the hardest,\n\n2:05:05.300 --> 2:05:09.440\n also, professional lifetimes for me, too,\n\n2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:13.380\n the absolute hardest days of late medical school,\n\n2:05:13.380 --> 2:05:18.300\n internship, taking call, getting up at 3 a.m.,\n\n2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:23.300\n surgery, medicine, rounds, unforgiving environments,\n\n2:05:24.380 --> 2:05:27.260\n and then all the while, personal life,\n\n2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:32.500\n stripped down to the bare, and these were low moments,\n\n2:05:32.500 --> 2:05:34.460\n and then I was hit particularly hard by\n\n2:05:35.740 --> 2:05:39.420\n just experiences on the clinical ward,\n\n2:05:39.420 --> 2:05:42.020\n connecting too deeply with patients,\n\n2:05:42.020 --> 2:05:44.020\n like a child with a brain tumor,\n\n2:05:44.020 --> 2:05:47.420\n and feeling it too strongly, and those things,\n\n2:05:49.400 --> 2:05:51.760\n when you get down to those lowest of the low moments,\n\n2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:53.580\n when everything is stripped away,\n\n2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:58.160\n and there's only this raw core,\n\n2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:00.260\n well, that's pretty hard.\n\n2:06:00.260 --> 2:06:02.060\n That was probably the lowest moment,\n\n2:06:02.060 --> 2:06:04.180\n and you learn a lot about yourself in those moments,\n\n2:06:04.180 --> 2:06:09.180\n you know, what's left, and then what are the roots out\n\n2:06:09.180 --> 2:06:14.180\n from there, and that can be powerful to see in yourself.\n\n2:06:15.420 --> 2:06:18.860\n Have you thought about killing yourself?\n\n2:06:18.860 --> 2:06:20.260\n I have not.\n\n2:06:20.260 --> 2:06:21.100\n I have not.\n\n2:06:21.100 --> 2:06:23.580\n Have you seen that thought in the distance?\n\n2:06:25.140 --> 2:06:28.940\n I am fortunate that that has not come to my mind,\n\n2:06:28.940 --> 2:06:32.020\n and I have not seen it, even in the distance,\n\n2:06:32.020 --> 2:06:36.900\n and in some ways, I've wondered if that's made me,\n\n2:06:36.900 --> 2:06:40.620\n am I a less effective psychiatrist because of that?\n\n2:06:40.620 --> 2:06:44.060\n I've been, I've felt everything stripped away.\n\n2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:48.220\n I've been at the lowest of the low, and yet, that.\n\n2:06:48.220 --> 2:06:49.060\n There's still hope.\n\n2:06:49.060 --> 2:06:52.420\n There's a light of hope still at the end of the tunnel.\n\n2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:55.280\n So you never lost, even for brief moments, that.\n\n2:06:56.780 --> 2:06:57.780\n Never did.\n\n2:06:57.780 --> 2:06:59.020\n I don't know why.\n\n2:06:59.020 --> 2:06:59.860\n You don't know why.\n\n2:06:59.860 --> 2:07:00.820\n There was no reason.\n\n2:07:00.820 --> 2:07:01.660\n You don't know why.\n\n2:07:01.660 --> 2:07:03.900\n No reason to feel hope at that moment, honestly.\n\n2:07:03.900 --> 2:07:07.700\n Uh, so it was just the light without reason.\n\n2:07:07.700 --> 2:07:08.840\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:13.180\n What wisdom do you draw from that time?\n\n2:07:15.060 --> 2:07:19.460\n About, so first of all, you said something funny,\n\n2:07:19.460 --> 2:07:23.140\n which is, I wonder if it, that it's somehow\n\n2:07:23.140 --> 2:07:28.140\n not having thoughts of suicide limits your capacity\n\n2:07:28.140 --> 2:07:33.140\n to truly understand somebody who is having those thoughts.\n\n2:07:34.780 --> 2:07:39.380\n So how many demons must a psychiatrist have\n\n2:07:39.380 --> 2:07:41.460\n in order to be a good psychiatrist?\n\n2:07:42.940 --> 2:07:45.420\n You know, this is a really interesting question.\n\n2:07:45.420 --> 2:07:47.580\n I think everybody knows, and I can say this,\n\n2:07:47.580 --> 2:07:50.820\n that psychiatrists can be a little unusual.\n\n2:07:50.820 --> 2:07:53.700\n We think about ourselves, right?\n\n2:07:53.700 --> 2:07:54.780\n We think about our brains.\n\n2:07:54.780 --> 2:07:56.940\n That may be one reason why we become psychiatrists\n\n2:07:56.940 --> 2:07:59.340\n is we think, oh, that's interesting going on in there.\n\n2:07:59.340 --> 2:08:00.660\n What's that about?\n\n2:08:00.660 --> 2:08:03.940\n So a little introspective, a little introverted maybe,\n\n2:08:03.940 --> 2:08:07.720\n and that's what can make us good when we're good.\n\n2:08:07.720 --> 2:08:12.720\n And, but also that may select for people\n\n2:08:12.720 --> 2:08:14.740\n who have some unusual aspects,\n\n2:08:14.740 --> 2:08:17.140\n but you don't have to have all of them.\n\n2:08:17.140 --> 2:08:21.100\n There's a lot that can go wrong in the psychiatric realm.\n\n2:08:21.100 --> 2:08:24.860\n I think having some of those, some of it,\n\n2:08:24.860 --> 2:08:26.140\n but not all of it is enough.\n\n2:08:26.140 --> 2:08:29.580\n You get to see how low things can get.\n\n2:08:29.580 --> 2:08:34.580\n You can get, you get empathy from that,\n\n2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:37.560\n even if the symptoms are not the same.\n\n2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:41.060\n Just empathy for struggle, for suffering.\n\n2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:42.820\n That's right, that's right.\n\n2:08:42.820 --> 2:08:46.820\n Do you yourself have to practice observing triggers\n\n2:08:46.820 --> 2:08:49.480\n just as a human operating in this world?\n\n2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:53.200\n I've definitely, those skills that have come from therapy,\n\n2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:55.940\n I've found them useful, yeah.\n\n2:08:55.940 --> 2:09:00.020\n If I noticed that, we've all been through experiences\n\n2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:03.380\n where we wonder, oh, I got really mad in that interaction.\n\n2:09:03.380 --> 2:09:05.300\n Why did I get that mad?\n\n2:09:05.300 --> 2:09:06.980\n Yeah, sure, maybe I could have been irritated,\n\n2:09:06.980 --> 2:09:08.660\n but man, why did I?\n\n2:09:08.660 --> 2:09:12.140\n And then thinking about it and realizing,\n\n2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:16.540\n okay, back up here, think about the broader context.\n\n2:09:18.740 --> 2:09:23.140\n Think about how that relates to prior events in my life.\n\n2:09:23.140 --> 2:09:25.940\n Okay, yeah, so this is a thing for me\n\n2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:30.140\n when something of this class happens, then it triggers me.\n\n2:09:30.140 --> 2:09:32.440\n So going forward, I'm gonna be aware of that.\n\n2:09:33.980 --> 2:09:35.100\n And I've definitely used that\n\n2:09:35.100 --> 2:09:40.100\n because you don't wanna be out of control of those emotions.\n\n2:09:40.420 --> 2:09:41.460\n You wanna identify them.\n\n2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:42.860\n You wanna know where they come from\n\n2:09:42.860 --> 2:09:44.780\n and you wanna head them off\n\n2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:48.300\n as a civilized human being living on this earth,\n\n2:09:48.300 --> 2:09:50.060\n trying to get along with other people.\n\n2:09:50.060 --> 2:09:51.980\n You wanna understand those moments.\n\n2:09:51.980 --> 2:09:56.880\n Let me return to Robin Williams for a second\n\n2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:00.820\n and looking at Robin Williams, the actor,\n\n2:10:00.820 --> 2:10:03.140\n sorry, the human,\n\n2:10:03.140 --> 2:10:06.320\n because you mentioned for depression,\n\n2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:08.220\n you can have everything going well.\n\n2:10:08.220 --> 2:10:12.940\n And I think there's just famous cases of just public figures\n\n2:10:12.940 --> 2:10:15.120\n because a lot of people know them,\n\n2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:19.700\n where they suffer quietly\n\n2:10:19.700 --> 2:10:22.620\n and it seems like from the outside perspective\n\n2:10:22.620 --> 2:10:24.820\n that they have everything going for them,\n\n2:10:24.820 --> 2:10:27.180\n that they're at the top of their career.\n\n2:10:27.180 --> 2:10:28.580\n Two people that come to mind\n\n2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:32.300\n are Robin Williams and Anthony Bourdain.\n\n2:10:32.300 --> 2:10:36.540\n What insight do you have in why either of those have taken,\n\n2:10:36.540 --> 2:10:39.860\n why Robin Williams, a comedian,\n\n2:10:39.860 --> 2:10:42.340\n one of sort of the most jolly humans?\n\n2:10:42.340 --> 2:10:43.820\n Obviously, there was always the darkness\n\n2:10:43.820 --> 2:10:48.820\n that he was channeling in order to present the happiness,\n\n2:10:50.340 --> 2:10:53.180\n but it feels like that realness is only possible\n\n2:10:53.180 --> 2:10:56.340\n when you're deeply self honest and analytical\n\n2:10:56.340 --> 2:10:59.460\n and then if you're deeply self honest,\n\n2:10:59.460 --> 2:11:00.920\n you're going to realize that there's a lot\n\n2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:03.620\n of beautiful things about life that you can discover\n\n2:11:03.620 --> 2:11:05.240\n and if you do that,\n\n2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:07.820\n how can you possibly then take your own life?\n\n2:11:07.820 --> 2:11:10.180\n I mean, you go through all of these thoughts\n\n2:11:10.180 --> 2:11:15.180\n and I think a lot of people really loved Robin Williams,\n\n2:11:16.100 --> 2:11:18.020\n which is why it was really difficult to see\n\n2:11:18.020 --> 2:11:21.420\n how can even him, how can even Robin Williams\n\n2:11:21.420 --> 2:11:22.260\n take his own life?\n\n2:11:22.260 --> 2:11:24.620\n So I don't know if there's something to be said\n\n2:11:24.620 --> 2:11:25.960\n about the nature of depression\n\n2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:27.780\n from just looking at his case.\n\n2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:33.380\n I think the action of suicide is not well understood.\n\n2:11:33.380 --> 2:11:35.540\n It doesn't always, although often,\n\n2:11:35.540 --> 2:11:37.660\n is correlated with depression.\n\n2:11:37.660 --> 2:11:40.420\n There are cases of suicide where there is not\n\n2:11:40.420 --> 2:11:42.900\n clear depression, that's in the minority.\n\n2:11:42.900 --> 2:11:44.260\n By the way, if I just,\n\n2:11:44.260 --> 2:11:46.120\n because you said it so interesting,\n\n2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:49.820\n action of suicide, because there's also thoughts of suicide\n\n2:11:49.820 --> 2:11:54.580\n and probably those, they're probably somewhat understood,\n\n2:11:54.580 --> 2:11:59.300\n but it's an interesting, because you can think of suicide,\n\n2:11:59.300 --> 2:12:00.940\n if you have suicidal ideation,\n\n2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:04.020\n you can think of that for so many reasons.\n\n2:12:04.020 --> 2:12:04.940\n That's right.\n\n2:12:04.940 --> 2:12:09.940\n And I mean, thoughts sometimes, like painful thoughts,\n\n2:12:16.380 --> 2:12:19.260\n angry thoughts, or thoughts in general,\n\n2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:21.340\n can be very different, like fantasies, for example.\n\n2:12:21.340 --> 2:12:24.440\n You can fantasize, like sexual fantasies.\n\n2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:28.480\n You can fantasize, I was just for humor's sake\n\n2:12:28.480 --> 2:12:30.780\n wanted to mention stuff, but then people think I'm serious,\n\n2:12:30.780 --> 2:12:32.380\n so I'm not gonna mention anything.\n\n2:12:32.380 --> 2:12:34.900\n But sexual fantasies, and then there's,\n\n2:12:34.900 --> 2:12:36.420\n I know there's people that have sexual fantasies\n\n2:12:36.420 --> 2:12:38.580\n and they don't wanna actually do that in real life.\n\n2:12:38.580 --> 2:12:41.400\n That sexual fantasy serves some kind of purpose\n\n2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:44.340\n in imagination only, and in that same way,\n\n2:12:44.340 --> 2:12:46.940\n suicide might serve a purpose in imagination only,\n\n2:12:46.940 --> 2:12:48.800\n is very unlikely to lead to action.\n\n2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:52.500\n And yet there's other thoughts that maybe are more amorphous\n\n2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:55.320\n that do lead to action, and that leap,\n\n2:12:56.300 --> 2:12:58.420\n yeah, that, oh boy, that's a fascinating,\n\n2:12:58.420 --> 2:13:02.140\n and that's such a philosophically powerful thought\n\n2:13:02.140 --> 2:13:05.680\n to not exist, like that question, that's the,\n\n2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:08.680\n is it Sarcher or Camus, Camus?\n\n2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:11.700\n Well, the myth is Sisyphus, Camus, who says,\n\n2:13:11.700 --> 2:13:14.580\n like basic question of why live?\n\n2:13:15.500 --> 2:13:16.500\n Good question.\n\n2:13:16.500 --> 2:13:18.100\n Yeah, right.\n\n2:13:18.100 --> 2:13:20.820\n So that's a great question, actually,\n\n2:13:20.820 --> 2:13:22.860\n and there are other related questions.\n\n2:13:22.860 --> 2:13:26.340\n Some people may have the thought of suicide\n\n2:13:26.340 --> 2:13:31.340\n because there seems no point, there's no joy in life.\n\n2:13:33.180 --> 2:13:36.780\n That's one reason that some people can put forward.\n\n2:13:36.780 --> 2:13:39.900\n Sometimes there's an, it's not just the absence of joy,\n\n2:13:39.900 --> 2:13:43.140\n there's an active pain, an active psychic pain\n\n2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:46.540\n in some people, and that, the inescapability of that\n\n2:13:47.500 --> 2:13:50.500\n is enough to drive the thoughts of suicide.\n\n2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:53.260\n And then there are interpersonal and cultural reasons\n\n2:13:53.260 --> 2:13:54.660\n as well that can show up.\n\n2:13:54.660 --> 2:13:59.660\n But the act, this act of ending of the self is,\n\n2:14:00.060 --> 2:14:02.500\n in all these cases, there's no real way to study this\n\n2:14:02.500 --> 2:14:05.300\n in animals, no other animal as far as we know\n\n2:14:05.300 --> 2:14:10.300\n that we can study has this concept of this is myself,\n\n2:14:10.780 --> 2:14:13.620\n the situation is not tolerable, therefore,\n\n2:14:13.620 --> 2:14:15.400\n I will end the self.\n\n2:14:15.400 --> 2:14:16.780\n To our knowledge, this is not something\n\n2:14:16.780 --> 2:14:18.740\n that can be studied in other animals.\n\n2:14:18.740 --> 2:14:23.740\n So it remains this very poorly understood action.\n\n2:14:26.260 --> 2:14:29.860\n And in predicting it, so what do we do as psychiatrists?\n\n2:14:29.860 --> 2:14:30.700\n We have this challenge.\n\n2:14:30.700 --> 2:14:33.980\n People come to the emergency room, they say they're suicidal\n\n2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:35.380\n or their friends say they're suicidal\n\n2:14:35.380 --> 2:14:39.060\n or they've taken some action that didn't lead to death.\n\n2:14:40.220 --> 2:14:41.060\n What do we do?\n\n2:14:41.060 --> 2:14:43.980\n Well, there's a whole range of options.\n\n2:14:43.980 --> 2:14:46.120\n Was it a suicidal gesture in the sense\n\n2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:51.120\n of not intending death or was the intent death?\n\n2:14:51.940 --> 2:14:53.620\n And if it was the intent was death,\n\n2:14:53.620 --> 2:14:54.440\n what were the reasons?\n\n2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:55.500\n Are the reasons transient?\n\n2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:56.980\n Are they gone now?\n\n2:14:56.980 --> 2:15:00.220\n What's the probability that it'll be repeated?\n\n2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:02.980\n So we do all these things just to decide\n\n2:15:02.980 --> 2:15:04.300\n what sort of treatment should be carried out,\n\n2:15:04.300 --> 2:15:09.060\n but nowhere is there a deep understanding of the biology,\n\n2:15:09.060 --> 2:15:12.520\n of the cells and circuits and activity patterns\n\n2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:16.860\n that underlie the action to end the self.\n\n2:15:16.860 --> 2:15:21.700\n It's a very, it's this frustrating thing.\n\n2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:26.460\n It's so timely, it's so common, it shows up in veterans,\n\n2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:29.420\n it shows up in kids, it shows up in people\n\n2:15:29.420 --> 2:15:33.580\n at every stage of life, and yet we're very bad\n\n2:15:33.580 --> 2:15:36.380\n at understanding it and we're relatively poor\n\n2:15:36.380 --> 2:15:40.820\n at predicting it and our tools are not very powerful.\n\n2:15:40.820 --> 2:15:42.740\n We can put people in a locked unit,\n\n2:15:42.740 --> 2:15:44.900\n we can give them care, therapy for a while.\n\n2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:47.140\n At some point, we release them\n\n2:15:47.140 --> 2:15:48.660\n and there's only so much we can do.\n\n2:15:48.660 --> 2:15:50.860\n It's one of the most frustrating things,\n\n2:15:50.860 --> 2:15:53.600\n the suffering that is linked to suicidality.\n\n2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:56.700\n But it is a decision and it is an action\n\n2:15:56.700 --> 2:15:58.380\n and if you look at optogenetics,\n\n2:15:58.380 --> 2:16:01.780\n you should be able to one day sort of understand\n\n2:16:01.780 --> 2:16:05.460\n the dynamics of such weighty decisions.\n\n2:16:05.460 --> 2:16:07.600\n The individual causes then, if someone is anhedonic,\n\n2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:11.300\n if there is no joy in life, that very likely\n\n2:16:11.300 --> 2:16:12.740\n is addressable by optogenetics.\n\n2:16:12.740 --> 2:16:16.880\n We know how to turn that dial very robustly in animals.\n\n2:16:17.780 --> 2:16:20.660\n The motivation to overcome challenges,\n\n2:16:20.660 --> 2:16:24.940\n that we have some hope of understanding.\n\n2:16:25.780 --> 2:16:28.380\n Psychic pain, internal negative states,\n\n2:16:28.380 --> 2:16:30.360\n we have actually a handle on that as well.\n\n2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:32.980\n There's a structure in the brain called the habenula\n\n2:16:32.980 --> 2:16:35.440\n and some linked structures around it\n\n2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:39.100\n that seems to generate this negative internal state.\n\n2:16:39.100 --> 2:16:42.500\n It's active when a state of acute disappointment,\n\n2:16:42.500 --> 2:16:47.280\n acute outcomes that go wrong, not as expected.\n\n2:16:49.940 --> 2:16:52.240\n Moments of unexpected pain.\n\n2:16:52.240 --> 2:16:54.220\n The habenula is there, it seems,\n\n2:16:54.220 --> 2:16:59.100\n it's active to report on internal negativity\n\n2:16:59.100 --> 2:17:00.940\n with its action.\n\n2:17:00.940 --> 2:17:02.680\n And so you could imagine strategies\n\n2:17:02.680 --> 2:17:03.900\n to target this brain structure\n\n2:17:03.900 --> 2:17:07.260\n that might have the effect of reducing psychic pain,\n\n2:17:07.260 --> 2:17:09.760\n reducing the negativity of internal states.\n\n2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:11.940\n That is a very concrete hope.\n\n2:17:11.940 --> 2:17:14.180\n It's precise, it's anatomical.\n\n2:17:14.180 --> 2:17:17.420\n Optogenetics has given us all the firm foundation we need\n\n2:17:17.420 --> 2:17:19.740\n to go after that question.\n\n2:17:19.740 --> 2:17:21.460\n So I think there is hope.\n\n2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:22.960\n If you look at the individual causes,\n\n2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:25.940\n the individual symptoms relating to suicide,\n\n2:17:25.940 --> 2:17:26.980\n and then it's like a puzzle,\n\n2:17:26.980 --> 2:17:29.340\n you put together the puzzle pieces.\n\n2:17:29.340 --> 2:17:33.940\n By the way, I do think my habenula is\n\n2:17:34.940 --> 2:17:37.420\n very functioning, very actively.\n\n2:17:37.420 --> 2:17:39.940\n And I wonder if it's like,\n\n2:17:39.940 --> 2:17:43.180\n because you can also learn to channel these things, right?\n\n2:17:43.180 --> 2:17:45.940\n Some of the things we suffer from,\n\n2:17:45.940 --> 2:17:48.220\n I mean, there's degrees of suffering,\n\n2:17:48.220 --> 2:17:53.220\n can be a source of progress and personal growth\n\n2:17:54.580 --> 2:17:57.020\n and development and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:17:57.020 --> 2:18:01.140\n I mean, I, what is it?\n\n2:18:01.140 --> 2:18:05.000\n Nietzsche suffered from stomach issues.\n\n2:18:07.300 --> 2:18:09.140\n I wonder if he's written some of those things\n\n2:18:09.140 --> 2:18:11.580\n if his stomach was all great.\n\n2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:15.260\n I mean, there's, I kind of think that\n\n2:18:18.060 --> 2:18:19.460\n a difficult life in some form,\n\n2:18:19.460 --> 2:18:21.740\n you can get, you get to choose in some regard\n\n2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:22.820\n and some of you don't.\n\n2:18:22.820 --> 2:18:25.340\n The difficulties you have and the ones you do have,\n\n2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:27.420\n it's nice to use if possible.\n\n2:18:27.420 --> 2:18:28.760\n Sometimes it's nice to treat,\n\n2:18:28.760 --> 2:18:31.460\n sometimes it's nice to use.\n\n2:18:31.460 --> 2:18:33.580\n Well, the way you phrase it, I think you're using it.\n\n2:18:33.580 --> 2:18:35.780\n I could be wrong, but if you,\n\n2:18:35.780 --> 2:18:39.180\n you phrased in this semi humorous way about your habenula,\n\n2:18:39.180 --> 2:18:43.780\n it seems to me that you're using that to good effect.\n\n2:18:43.780 --> 2:18:46.300\n Now, but one never really knows\n\n2:18:46.300 --> 2:18:48.100\n what someone else's internal state is.\n\n2:18:48.100 --> 2:18:51.860\n As I look at you, I don't know the depths of what's going on\n\n2:18:51.860 --> 2:18:56.780\n and it's possible that it's a much harder situation\n\n2:18:56.780 --> 2:18:57.820\n in there.\n\n2:18:57.820 --> 2:18:58.700\n Yes.\n\n2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:00.400\n So that's, I actually worry about this a lot.\n\n2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:02.120\n So I'm extremely self critical,\n\n2:19:02.120 --> 2:19:04.420\n like in the privacy of my own mind,\n\n2:19:04.420 --> 2:19:05.900\n which is an interesting thing\n\n2:19:05.900 --> 2:19:07.780\n when you get to meet the internet\n\n2:19:07.780 --> 2:19:09.960\n and the internet will tell you you suck.\n\n2:19:11.580 --> 2:19:15.100\n But for now, now this is what I worry about\n\n2:19:15.100 --> 2:19:16.820\n and I'm very paying attention.\n\n2:19:16.820 --> 2:19:19.280\n For now it's really, I just have this like very negative\n\n2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:23.620\n voice, but that voice seems to be very useful\n\n2:19:23.620 --> 2:19:26.320\n for productivity and so I channel it.\n\n2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:29.060\n I just put it on the table and let that voice like\n\n2:19:29.060 --> 2:19:33.980\n talk to me, but I'm very, I'm like monitoring that voice\n\n2:19:33.980 --> 2:19:35.780\n because looking at Robin Williams, you know,\n\n2:19:35.780 --> 2:19:38.940\n you get older, your brain changes or like you're,\n\n2:19:38.940 --> 2:19:43.540\n and then that voice can now all of a sudden grow, right?\n\n2:19:43.540 --> 2:19:45.260\n And then where you can't control as much,\n\n2:19:45.260 --> 2:19:47.900\n you have to be very careful with these kinds of things.\n\n2:19:47.900 --> 2:19:50.180\n You're very right about that.\n\n2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:53.060\n So my negativity, I have this,\n\n2:19:53.060 --> 2:19:56.020\n I never think I've done enough is sort of where my\n\n2:19:56.020 --> 2:19:57.460\n negativity comes from inside.\n\n2:19:57.460 --> 2:20:02.460\n I never think that I've met the potential of the moment.\n\n2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:07.420\n I haven't done, I haven't, you know,\n\n2:20:08.780 --> 2:20:12.180\n made the most of the opportunities that are available.\n\n2:20:12.180 --> 2:20:15.100\n Still early, I haven't, you know,\n\n2:20:15.100 --> 2:20:16.660\n progressed as far as I should.\n\n2:20:16.660 --> 2:20:20.940\n And exactly as you're saying, that works for a while.\n\n2:20:20.940 --> 2:20:23.660\n But then what happens as you get later in life\n\n2:20:23.660 --> 2:20:28.660\n and there's less runway to, you know, fix that.\n\n2:20:28.940 --> 2:20:33.020\n And then maybe then that negative voice is a problem.\n\n2:20:33.020 --> 2:20:34.940\n But also at that point, the negative voice\n\n2:20:34.940 --> 2:20:36.820\n starts having more and more of a point.\n\n2:20:36.820 --> 2:20:39.900\n When you're being very successful,\n\n2:20:39.900 --> 2:20:42.160\n it's easy to be like, no, okay, well,\n\n2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:46.100\n like because later in life, you're really literally\n\n2:20:46.100 --> 2:20:49.700\n just sitting there on a rocking chair doing nothing.\n\n2:20:49.700 --> 2:20:53.640\n And then it's, or maybe any kind of tragedy happens.\n\n2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:57.140\n Loss of a loved one, loss of a job,\n\n2:20:57.140 --> 2:21:01.480\n loss or you get screwed over in some kind of way.\n\n2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:02.540\n I don't know.\n\n2:21:02.540 --> 2:21:04.180\n And then all of a sudden the negative voice\n\n2:21:04.180 --> 2:21:05.660\n is just you and the negative voice\n\n2:21:05.660 --> 2:21:07.940\n for days and days and days.\n\n2:21:07.940 --> 2:21:10.380\n And so I don't know, to go back to your example\n\n2:21:10.380 --> 2:21:13.420\n of Robin Williams, I don't know what was going on inside him.\n\n2:21:13.420 --> 2:21:15.460\n I don't know the nature of his internal state.\n\n2:21:15.460 --> 2:21:18.540\n Was it active psychic pain that?\n\n2:21:18.540 --> 2:21:20.240\n May I mention, may I interrupt to just say\n\n2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:23.580\n that Sergei posted an examination of Robin Williams.\n\n2:21:23.580 --> 2:21:27.380\n His brain tissue suggested that he suffered from quote,\n\n2:21:27.380 --> 2:21:32.380\n diffuse LEWY, Lewy body dementia, LBD.\n\n2:21:33.840 --> 2:21:38.300\n Depression is a symptom of LBD and it's not about psychology.\n\n2:21:38.300 --> 2:21:40.460\n It's rooted in urology.\n\n2:21:40.460 --> 2:21:42.020\n This is words from Sergei.\n\n2:21:42.020 --> 2:21:43.660\n His brain was falling apart.\n\n2:21:43.660 --> 2:21:45.340\n Yeah, Lewy body dementia.\n\n2:21:45.340 --> 2:21:47.660\n This is a very interesting neurological disorder\n\n2:21:47.660 --> 2:21:51.900\n where among other things, there's neuron death indeed.\n\n2:21:51.900 --> 2:21:54.540\n So you've got frank neuron loss.\n\n2:21:54.540 --> 2:21:58.280\n It's not just a matter of some longstanding psychic pain,\n\n2:21:58.280 --> 2:22:00.940\n but you've got a progressive loss.\n\n2:22:00.940 --> 2:22:03.020\n And so clearly you've got a situation\n\n2:22:03.020 --> 2:22:04.500\n where he could have finally reached a point\n\n2:22:04.500 --> 2:22:07.540\n where the balance that he'd worked out\n\n2:22:07.540 --> 2:22:12.460\n between negativity and positivity was disrupted due to loss.\n\n2:22:12.460 --> 2:22:15.140\n The wrong cells died, the wrong projections were cut.\n\n2:22:15.140 --> 2:22:16.920\n By the Lewy body dementia.\n\n2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:19.620\n Certainly dopamine neurons die in Lewy body dementia.\n\n2:22:19.620 --> 2:22:23.440\n Those are neurons that give rise to much of the feelings\n\n2:22:23.440 --> 2:22:27.380\n of reward and pleasure that we experience among other roles.\n\n2:22:27.380 --> 2:22:30.700\n So clearly in his case, there could have been\n\n2:22:30.700 --> 2:22:34.360\n a very concrete cellular neurological issue\n\n2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:36.860\n that was progressive and pushed him to that point.\n\n2:22:37.740 --> 2:22:41.720\n But were you about to make a point about broader\n\n2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:45.020\n that if there is not a neurological degeneration?\n\n2:22:45.020 --> 2:22:47.380\n Yeah, so in his case, not knowing that,\n\n2:22:48.340 --> 2:22:49.660\n it could have been simply that,\n\n2:22:49.660 --> 2:22:52.780\n let's say he had an internal psychic pain state\n\n2:22:52.780 --> 2:22:56.660\n and he was in sort of a compensated mode\n\n2:22:56.660 --> 2:22:58.740\n for much of his life, able to generate enough joy\n\n2:22:58.740 --> 2:23:01.160\n from his comedy and his social interactions.\n\n2:23:02.660 --> 2:23:06.860\n But eventually later in life, those things drop away,\n\n2:23:06.860 --> 2:23:08.180\n the balance shifts.\n\n2:23:08.180 --> 2:23:10.780\n You get tired of fighting the pain for that long.\n\n2:23:10.780 --> 2:23:14.160\n So you've got this time dependent non stationarity\n\n2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:18.260\n that happens and then the same symptom\n\n2:23:18.260 --> 2:23:20.260\n becomes no longer tolerable in the end.\n\n2:23:21.180 --> 2:23:22.660\n What is autism?\n\n2:23:22.660 --> 2:23:24.300\n What do we know about autism?\n\n2:23:25.420 --> 2:23:30.420\n Human beings exist on a spectrum of how social we can be.\n\n2:23:30.700 --> 2:23:34.640\n And this is pretty interesting actually, scientifically,\n\n2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:38.240\n but also very important clinically.\n\n2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:40.420\n There are hyper social states where people\n\n2:23:40.420 --> 2:23:42.800\n are almost too social.\n\n2:23:42.800 --> 2:23:44.740\n There are chromosomal deletion states\n\n2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:47.740\n where people have instant affinity and bonding\n\n2:23:47.740 --> 2:23:52.740\n and rich deep seeming connections with people, very verbal.\n\n2:23:52.740 --> 2:23:57.620\n On the other end, people with autism spectrum disorder\n\n2:23:57.620 --> 2:24:02.620\n are not able to keep up with social interactions\n\n2:24:05.300 --> 2:24:06.540\n and it's a spectrum.\n\n2:24:06.540 --> 2:24:09.500\n Some have mild to moderate difficulties.\n\n2:24:09.500 --> 2:24:13.800\n They may have inability to understand\n\n2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:16.140\n what the next thing to do in a social situation is,\n\n2:24:16.140 --> 2:24:18.980\n but may have perfectly good language abilities.\n\n2:24:19.820 --> 2:24:21.860\n And as you progress further along the spectrum,\n\n2:24:21.860 --> 2:24:23.180\n that gets more and more severe\n\n2:24:23.180 --> 2:24:28.100\n so they can't make eye contact because it's too overwhelming\n\n2:24:28.100 --> 2:24:29.780\n to think about what has to be done next\n\n2:24:29.780 --> 2:24:32.260\n if a person looks in a particular way.\n\n2:24:32.260 --> 2:24:33.460\n And then as you go farther,\n\n2:24:33.460 --> 2:24:38.020\n then language and social communication themselves break down\n\n2:24:38.020 --> 2:24:41.980\n so there's no reciprocity, there's no shared enjoyment.\n\n2:24:41.980 --> 2:24:43.500\n And that this gets very hard then\n\n2:24:43.500 --> 2:24:45.340\n as you get to this far end of the spectrum\n\n2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:50.060\n where there's really an absence of social cognition at all\n\n2:24:50.060 --> 2:24:52.820\n and social bonding.\n\n2:24:52.820 --> 2:24:54.580\n So why does this exist?\n\n2:24:54.580 --> 2:24:55.620\n What is it?\n\n2:24:55.620 --> 2:24:56.860\n It's very genetic.\n\n2:24:56.860 --> 2:25:00.020\n As I mentioned, it's one of the top three or four\n\n2:25:00.020 --> 2:25:03.820\n most biological in the sense of most genetically determined\n\n2:25:03.820 --> 2:25:05.400\n of the psychiatric illnesses.\n\n2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:08.020\n It does have these interesting positive correlations,\n\n2:25:08.020 --> 2:25:09.240\n slight positive correlations\n\n2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:11.420\n with intelligence and education.\n\n2:25:13.420 --> 2:25:16.140\n And the reason for that\n\n2:25:16.140 --> 2:25:18.300\n is kind of interesting to think about.\n\n2:25:18.300 --> 2:25:19.480\n Is there something good about it?\n\n2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:23.020\n Just like, or at least with at least part of the spectrum,\n\n2:25:23.020 --> 2:25:23.980\n is there something good about it?\n\n2:25:23.980 --> 2:25:26.220\n Just as we were talking about for depression,\n\n2:25:26.220 --> 2:25:27.460\n as you could say for mania,\n\n2:25:27.460 --> 2:25:29.260\n as you could say for schizophrenia.\n\n2:25:30.340 --> 2:25:33.660\n And here it's kind of interesting\n\n2:25:33.660 --> 2:25:37.380\n to think about the underlying science\n\n2:25:37.380 --> 2:25:40.200\n of what it means to be good at a social interaction.\n\n2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:44.020\n Someone who's very good at a social interaction\n\n2:25:44.020 --> 2:25:45.220\n is incredibly good at dealing\n\n2:25:45.220 --> 2:25:48.420\n with unpredictable information,\n\n2:25:48.420 --> 2:25:51.420\n is able to handle this torrent of information\n\n2:25:51.420 --> 2:25:54.300\n coming through rapidly changing\n\n2:25:56.020 --> 2:25:58.540\n model of the other person and of the interaction\n\n2:25:58.540 --> 2:26:02.540\n and their model of you, your model of them.\n\n2:26:02.540 --> 2:26:03.940\n With each word that changes,\n\n2:26:03.940 --> 2:26:05.580\n with each new bit of information\n\n2:26:05.580 --> 2:26:06.940\n that comes in through the conversation,\n\n2:26:06.940 --> 2:26:09.740\n each bit of body language, all this is rapidly changing.\n\n2:26:09.740 --> 2:26:12.400\n And some people are able to keep up\n\n2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:15.640\n with that firehose of information perfectly well.\n\n2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:17.300\n But that's a special brain state to be in.\n\n2:26:17.300 --> 2:26:20.420\n That's working with unpredictability.\n\n2:26:20.420 --> 2:26:24.500\n That's the only way that can be done\n\n2:26:24.500 --> 2:26:29.100\n is most likely by constantly running models\n\n2:26:29.100 --> 2:26:32.200\n of what the other person might be about to say.\n\n2:26:32.200 --> 2:26:34.360\n So you can't stop and think, oh, what did that word mean?\n\n2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:37.660\n What did that shift in eye contact mean?\n\n2:26:37.660 --> 2:26:38.800\n What do they mean together?\n\n2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:41.180\n There has to be some advanced work going on\n\n2:26:41.180 --> 2:26:42.440\n where you're predicting what's going on\n\n2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:43.840\n if you're to keep up with a rich\n\n2:26:43.840 --> 2:26:45.300\n and fast social interaction.\n\n2:26:46.620 --> 2:26:51.620\n Now, on the flip side, there are brain states\n\n2:26:51.700 --> 2:26:53.580\n that maybe don't have to work so fast\n\n2:26:53.580 --> 2:26:54.940\n but that are extremely important still.\n\n2:26:54.940 --> 2:26:57.100\n Dealing with something that's not moving\n\n2:26:57.100 --> 2:27:00.220\n or that's predictable, still complex,\n\n2:27:00.220 --> 2:27:05.220\n like mathematical proof or a very complex arrangement\n\n2:27:05.500 --> 2:27:08.740\n of geometrical shapes, a large number\n\n2:27:08.740 --> 2:27:11.100\n of individual nonmoving things.\n\n2:27:11.100 --> 2:27:14.420\n There's possibly a way of being that's particularly good\n\n2:27:14.420 --> 2:27:16.460\n at dealing with these static, unmoving,\n\n2:27:16.460 --> 2:27:19.980\n or predictable situations and less so\n\n2:27:19.980 --> 2:27:22.940\n with these rapidly changing social situations.\n\n2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:25.940\n And so the way I conceptualize autism\n\n2:27:25.940 --> 2:27:30.940\n is these are people whose brains are not so good\n\n2:27:31.020 --> 2:27:34.500\n with the high bit rate, unpredictable information,\n\n2:27:34.500 --> 2:27:38.060\n but may be quite good at given enough time,\n\n2:27:38.060 --> 2:27:43.060\n given the grace to work with the system,\n\n2:27:45.140 --> 2:27:46.980\n to look at it from different angles,\n\n2:27:47.860 --> 2:27:49.740\n to take different perspectives with a confidence\n\n2:27:49.740 --> 2:27:52.880\n that it's not changing in between perspectives.\n\n2:27:53.980 --> 2:27:55.680\n That's a brain state that's valuable.\n\n2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:59.540\n It's something that has probably contributed\n\n2:27:59.540 --> 2:28:01.140\n to a lot of the success of the human family,\n\n2:28:01.140 --> 2:28:02.340\n being able to design something,\n\n2:28:02.340 --> 2:28:07.340\n being able to consider all the different contributions\n\n2:28:09.060 --> 2:28:13.300\n to a static, predictable system.\n\n2:28:13.300 --> 2:28:17.820\n So autism, in a sense, is a spectrum\n\n2:28:17.820 --> 2:28:21.140\n that has identifiable characteristics\n\n2:28:21.140 --> 2:28:25.100\n about the way people deal with dynamic information,\n\n2:28:25.100 --> 2:28:29.100\n often expressed itself as like social dynamic information.\n\n2:28:29.100 --> 2:28:31.180\n But you critically, your use of the word often there\n\n2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:32.700\n is really, I think, smart,\n\n2:28:32.700 --> 2:28:35.900\n because it's not just social interaction\n\n2:28:35.900 --> 2:28:37.220\n that is a challenge in autism.\n\n2:28:37.220 --> 2:28:39.980\n And so many people conceptualize it purely\n\n2:28:39.980 --> 2:28:44.820\n as a social dysfunction disorder.\n\n2:28:44.820 --> 2:28:47.560\n But it's really any unpredictable information\n\n2:28:47.560 --> 2:28:49.500\n that's a problem, that's a challenge\n\n2:28:49.500 --> 2:28:50.880\n for people on the spectrum.\n\n2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:55.880\n They react very negatively to unexpected sounds,\n\n2:28:56.260 --> 2:28:59.300\n even if not social sounds, unexpected lights,\n\n2:28:59.300 --> 2:29:02.300\n unexpected touches, and so it's really\n\n2:29:02.300 --> 2:29:05.060\n unpredictable information that is, in my view,\n\n2:29:05.060 --> 2:29:08.380\n the core problem with the processing in autism,\n\n2:29:08.380 --> 2:29:09.220\n not just social.\n\n2:29:09.220 --> 2:29:11.500\n Social just shows up because it's so unpredictable.\n\n2:29:11.500 --> 2:29:12.940\n Yeah, it's so interesting.\n\n2:29:12.940 --> 2:29:16.780\n I mean, I try to not to think about that stuff.\n\n2:29:16.780 --> 2:29:21.780\n I'm afraid of thinking about disorders\n\n2:29:22.580 --> 2:29:25.440\n and things like that because just like I don't like\n\n2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:28.500\n sort of economics or game theory,\n\n2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:32.260\n I want to be careful with it because it,\n\n2:29:32.260 --> 2:29:34.300\n whenever you have a category or a model,\n\n2:29:34.300 --> 2:29:37.620\n it's too easy to just, for everything,\n\n2:29:37.620 --> 2:29:39.400\n I mean, it's the OCD thing.\n\n2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:40.860\n I like models too much.\n\n2:29:40.860 --> 2:29:42.220\n I like categories too much.\n\n2:29:42.220 --> 2:29:44.200\n The moment you acknowledge yourself,\n\n2:29:44.200 --> 2:29:46.340\n well, I have an eating disorder, for example,\n\n2:29:46.340 --> 2:29:49.180\n or something like that, as opposed to just being a,\n\n2:29:49.180 --> 2:29:51.340\n well, I'll just leave it at that\n\n2:29:51.340 --> 2:29:54.520\n from my own critical understanding of myself.\n\n2:29:54.520 --> 2:29:56.940\n Let's just say I don't know how to moderate eating fruit.\n\n2:29:56.940 --> 2:29:57.780\n People make fun of me.\n\n2:29:57.780 --> 2:30:00.780\n They think all fruit is healthy.\n\n2:30:00.780 --> 2:30:01.660\n I know.\n\n2:30:03.100 --> 2:30:05.200\n I don't know how to moderate anything,\n\n2:30:05.200 --> 2:30:10.200\n but even fruit, apples and cherries, is a nightmare.\n\n2:30:10.260 --> 2:30:14.380\n Anyway, that's such a psychiatrist thing to say.\n\n2:30:14.380 --> 2:30:15.220\n Very interesting.\n\n2:30:15.220 --> 2:30:16.060\n Thank you.\n\n2:30:18.340 --> 2:30:22.680\n But there's characteristics and it's interesting\n\n2:30:22.680 --> 2:30:24.300\n to think about, like for example,\n\n2:30:24.300 --> 2:30:26.580\n I have trouble making eye contact,\n\n2:30:26.580 --> 2:30:29.020\n but I actually, as you said it now,\n\n2:30:29.020 --> 2:30:34.020\n it's not that I'm shy at all in that sense.\n\n2:30:35.140 --> 2:30:38.540\n It's literally, I'm getting way too much information\n\n2:30:38.540 --> 2:30:40.180\n and it's distracting me.\n\n2:30:40.180 --> 2:30:44.020\n Like I need to just close my eyes so I can,\n\n2:30:44.020 --> 2:30:46.580\n like all the things that people seem to be able to do\n\n2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:51.020\n in parallel, it's just, you just asked me a question.\n\n2:30:51.020 --> 2:30:53.300\n For me to think about the answer to that question,\n\n2:30:53.300 --> 2:30:56.120\n I can't have all this cool, rich visual information\n\n2:30:56.120 --> 2:30:57.180\n coming my way.\n\n2:30:57.180 --> 2:31:01.020\n That's literally, because I often close my eyes to think.\n\n2:31:01.020 --> 2:31:04.060\n It's not because I'm afraid of something, whatever.\n\n2:31:04.060 --> 2:31:06.940\n It's just like too much information happening here.\n\n2:31:06.940 --> 2:31:08.980\n Well, that's a beautiful description.\n\n2:31:08.980 --> 2:31:12.300\n It's amazing that that is how you experience\n\n2:31:12.300 --> 2:31:15.620\n the eye contact aspect.\n\n2:31:15.620 --> 2:31:18.340\n I think that's, I mean, you've articulated\n\n2:31:18.340 --> 2:31:22.620\n what captures it for so many people,\n\n2:31:22.620 --> 2:31:23.720\n which is that it's overwhelming.\n\n2:31:23.720 --> 2:31:26.020\n There's just too much information just coming in\n\n2:31:26.020 --> 2:31:30.740\n through the eyes and to keep up with it,\n\n2:31:30.740 --> 2:31:33.460\n to know you're gonna be expected to keep up with it,\n\n2:31:33.460 --> 2:31:35.140\n first of all, so there's that aspect.\n\n2:31:35.140 --> 2:31:37.200\n You know, you've learned socially\n\n2:31:37.200 --> 2:31:38.900\n that there's gonna be an expectation\n\n2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:40.740\n if you're making eye contact.\n\n2:31:40.740 --> 2:31:42.740\n People are gonna think you're keeping up with it,\n\n2:31:42.740 --> 2:31:45.660\n and you don't want to because you wanna focus\n\n2:31:45.660 --> 2:31:50.200\n on other things and make progress in other dimensions.\n\n2:31:50.200 --> 2:31:52.220\n Yeah, and so then there's a strong desire\n\n2:31:52.220 --> 2:31:53.580\n to look away or to close the eyes\n\n2:31:53.580 --> 2:31:57.860\n because it's overwhelming, it's a distraction,\n\n2:31:57.860 --> 2:32:00.180\n and it's gonna cause errors of understanding.\n\n2:32:00.180 --> 2:32:02.020\n And of course, our eyes, that's part,\n\n2:32:02.020 --> 2:32:04.540\n the way we use our eyes is part of the human communication,\n\n2:32:04.540 --> 2:32:07.180\n so you have to kind of be aware of that,\n\n2:32:07.180 --> 2:32:10.580\n of that element of it.\n\n2:32:10.580 --> 2:32:12.140\n So yeah, I mean, but it's fascinating.\n\n2:32:12.140 --> 2:32:13.940\n You should be aware of your own self\n\n2:32:13.940 --> 2:32:16.180\n in those little characteristics,\n\n2:32:16.180 --> 2:32:19.580\n whether it's classified on some aspect\n\n2:32:19.580 --> 2:32:22.860\n of the autism spectrum or just in general,\n\n2:32:22.860 --> 2:32:26.220\n whether it's eating, whether it's depression,\n\n2:32:26.220 --> 2:32:29.180\n whether it's even like schizophrenia\n\n2:32:29.180 --> 2:32:32.980\n that I hope we get a chance to talk to a little bit.\n\n2:32:32.980 --> 2:32:35.420\n Yeah, but those things are all made up\n\n2:32:35.420 --> 2:32:40.100\n of different symptoms and characteristics,\n\n2:32:40.100 --> 2:32:43.380\n and use them as a superpower, I suppose,\n\n2:32:43.380 --> 2:32:47.900\n is the best we can hope for in mild cases, I guess.\n\n2:32:47.900 --> 2:32:50.300\n I do think both brain states can't coexist\n\n2:32:50.300 --> 2:32:51.140\n at the same time.\n\n2:32:51.140 --> 2:32:52.820\n The way of dealing with something unpredictable\n\n2:32:52.820 --> 2:32:55.140\n and dealing with something predictable,\n\n2:32:55.140 --> 2:32:56.500\n those are different ways of being,\n\n2:32:56.500 --> 2:33:01.100\n here's a huge opportunity for very creative\n\n2:33:01.100 --> 2:33:04.540\n model building in theoretical neuroscience\n\n2:33:04.540 --> 2:33:07.180\n and linking that to these data streams\n\n2:33:07.180 --> 2:33:11.060\n we're getting across the brain that we talked about earlier,\n\n2:33:11.060 --> 2:33:13.660\n these immense data sets of activity across the brain.\n\n2:33:15.300 --> 2:33:17.300\n Here's where I think there could be\n\n2:33:17.300 --> 2:33:19.860\n a real convergence of theoreticians and experimentalists\n\n2:33:19.860 --> 2:33:23.100\n to say, okay, given what we know about wiring of the brain,\n\n2:33:24.420 --> 2:33:27.900\n here is what the brain state is likely to be\n\n2:33:27.900 --> 2:33:30.980\n that deals well with unpredictable information,\n\n2:33:30.980 --> 2:33:31.860\n and here's the brain state\n\n2:33:31.860 --> 2:33:33.740\n that deals with predictable information.\n\n2:33:33.740 --> 2:33:36.580\n Here's why they're incompatible, at least at the same time.\n\n2:33:36.580 --> 2:33:39.100\n Here's why you've gotta be able to detect\n\n2:33:39.100 --> 2:33:40.140\n which state you should be in.\n\n2:33:40.140 --> 2:33:42.140\n Here's how you could switch between them.\n\n2:33:42.140 --> 2:33:44.700\n Here's the kind of cells that you would predict,\n\n2:33:44.700 --> 2:33:46.540\n almost like predicting the Higgs boson.\n\n2:33:46.540 --> 2:33:49.540\n Here's the kind of circuitry that I would predict\n\n2:33:49.540 --> 2:33:51.820\n should govern the switching,\n\n2:33:51.820 --> 2:33:56.460\n or might make one state too sticky, too hard to get out of.\n\n2:33:58.300 --> 2:34:01.100\n That is a huge opportunity for an interaction\n\n2:34:01.100 --> 2:34:04.300\n from the theoretical and experimental side together.\n\n2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:07.900\n Make one state too sticky.\n\n2:34:07.900 --> 2:34:12.580\n The sort of measure the stickiness of the state\n\n2:34:12.580 --> 2:34:14.980\n and how to lessen the stickiness.\n\n2:34:14.980 --> 2:34:16.500\n Get some oil in the machine.\n\n2:34:16.500 --> 2:34:19.460\n Yes, yeah, what would predict the kind of oil\n\n2:34:19.460 --> 2:34:20.500\n that would work well.\n\n2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:26.900\n What, in your practice, is treatment or advice\n\n2:34:27.940 --> 2:34:31.340\n for the people on the autism spectrum?\n\n2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:34.460\n So right now, there's no real medical treatment.\n\n2:34:34.460 --> 2:34:36.580\n There are behavioral treatments\n\n2:34:36.580 --> 2:34:38.860\n that are most effective early in life.\n\n2:34:38.860 --> 2:34:42.140\n They make sure people don't fall too far behind.\n\n2:34:42.140 --> 2:34:43.780\n If you're not interacting socially,\n\n2:34:43.780 --> 2:34:46.900\n you create this vicious cycle\n\n2:34:46.900 --> 2:34:48.580\n where you fall farther and farther behind\n\n2:34:48.580 --> 2:34:49.700\n because you're not interacting.\n\n2:34:49.700 --> 2:34:52.700\n And these therapies which are applied early in life,\n\n2:34:52.700 --> 2:34:54.380\n therapists work with the kids,\n\n2:34:55.860 --> 2:34:57.860\n train them to deal with these things\n\n2:34:57.860 --> 2:34:59.860\n that otherwise would be aversive to them,\n\n2:34:59.860 --> 2:35:02.660\n teach them how to predict things and interact,\n\n2:35:02.660 --> 2:35:04.820\n and that has a big effect.\n\n2:35:04.820 --> 2:35:06.820\n But it's behavioral therapy.\n\n2:35:06.820 --> 2:35:08.820\n There's no medicine that works.\n\n2:35:08.820 --> 2:35:12.020\n There are ways of reducing individual symptoms though\n\n2:35:12.020 --> 2:35:13.980\n that sometimes come along with autism\n\n2:35:13.980 --> 2:35:15.700\n and those do respond to medications.\n\n2:35:15.700 --> 2:35:18.660\n So you can, one thing, very often,\n\n2:35:18.660 --> 2:35:21.380\n my patients with autism are very anxious\n\n2:35:21.380 --> 2:35:23.820\n because they live in a world\n\n2:35:23.820 --> 2:35:25.500\n that they have a really hard time\n\n2:35:25.500 --> 2:35:26.540\n predicting what's gonna happen.\n\n2:35:26.540 --> 2:35:29.380\n And so they find, and some of these are high functioning,\n\n2:35:29.380 --> 2:35:33.820\n Silicon Valley types who they may make great livings\n\n2:35:33.820 --> 2:35:37.180\n but they're very unhappy because they're on the spectrum.\n\n2:35:38.100 --> 2:35:43.100\n They don't understand how social interactions really work.\n\n2:35:43.220 --> 2:35:46.180\n They're very anxiety provoking\n\n2:35:46.180 --> 2:35:47.180\n because they don't know what to say.\n\n2:35:47.180 --> 2:35:50.900\n They don't have any clue how anybody else knows what to say.\n\n2:35:50.900 --> 2:35:52.700\n They're constantly worried they're gonna say something\n\n2:35:52.700 --> 2:35:54.540\n that's completely inappropriate\n\n2:35:54.540 --> 2:35:55.580\n and so they're very anxious.\n\n2:35:55.580 --> 2:35:57.420\n And I can treat their anxiety.\n\n2:35:57.420 --> 2:35:59.700\n It doesn't touch the autism per se\n\n2:35:59.700 --> 2:36:01.620\n but I can help them with their anxiety.\n\n2:36:02.500 --> 2:36:04.340\n What I just talked about, eye contact.\n\n2:36:05.220 --> 2:36:08.260\n I am richly, even with eyes closed\n\n2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:09.340\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n2:36:09.340 --> 2:36:12.220\n I'm richly experiencing the world.\n\n2:36:12.220 --> 2:36:14.420\n And it's not like you're afraid of the world\n\n2:36:14.420 --> 2:36:16.100\n or you're not able, I don't know what to do.\n\n2:36:16.100 --> 2:36:17.420\n No, I know everything.\n\n2:36:17.420 --> 2:36:19.140\n In fact, I know way too much.\n\n2:36:19.140 --> 2:36:20.820\n There's so many cool options.\n\n2:36:20.820 --> 2:36:24.540\n Like at any one moment, there's all the stuff happening\n\n2:36:24.540 --> 2:36:26.180\n and it's all beautiful.\n\n2:36:26.180 --> 2:36:28.620\n And at any one moment, you can do anything you want.\n\n2:36:28.620 --> 2:36:29.780\n You can take off your clothes.\n\n2:36:29.780 --> 2:36:31.740\n You can punch that guy over there.\n\n2:36:31.740 --> 2:36:33.820\n You can run away.\n\n2:36:33.820 --> 2:36:35.820\n You can go in for a hug.\n\n2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:38.380\n You can say something profound and deep\n\n2:36:38.380 --> 2:36:39.980\n or you can say something generic\n\n2:36:39.980 --> 2:36:42.260\n or you can do so many things you can say.\n\n2:36:42.260 --> 2:36:46.380\n And then it'll go, it'll unravel in all these kinds of ways\n\n2:36:46.380 --> 2:36:48.900\n and this moment could be completely life changing\n\n2:36:48.900 --> 2:36:51.300\n or it can be mundane and meaningless.\n\n2:36:51.300 --> 2:36:54.540\n And all of those options are before you at any one moment.\n\n2:36:54.540 --> 2:36:59.540\n And so it's like, it's amazing and overwhelming\n\n2:36:59.820 --> 2:37:02.100\n if you allow yourself to think about it,\n\n2:37:02.100 --> 2:37:04.660\n which whatever, exactly.\n\n2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:06.340\n Like, well, I'm fortunate with chess,\n\n2:37:06.340 --> 2:37:08.460\n you have a few set options.\n\n2:37:08.460 --> 2:37:11.860\n Two dimensional, at least dimensional is constraints.\n\n2:37:11.860 --> 2:37:15.140\n There is unlimited possibilities\n\n2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:18.420\n and unlimited beautiful things happening all around you.\n\n2:37:18.420 --> 2:37:20.540\n So I don't think there's a kind of sense\n\n2:37:20.540 --> 2:37:25.540\n that somehow you're limited in the places of,\n\n2:37:28.140 --> 2:37:29.820\n in the way you can see the world\n\n2:37:29.820 --> 2:37:31.860\n and how you can interact with that world.\n\n2:37:31.860 --> 2:37:35.400\n I am overwhelmed by the lack of limit.\n\n2:37:36.300 --> 2:37:38.540\n That all of us should be, have you looked around?\n\n2:37:38.540 --> 2:37:40.180\n You can do whatever the hell you want.\n\n2:37:40.180 --> 2:37:42.180\n Nobody will remember you anyway.\n\n2:37:42.180 --> 2:37:44.100\n All of us will be dead one day.\n\n2:37:44.100 --> 2:37:45.820\n You could do anything.\n\n2:37:45.820 --> 2:37:49.700\n You can, I don't know, you can get naked\n\n2:37:49.700 --> 2:37:50.900\n and run around the city,\n\n2:37:50.900 --> 2:37:52.700\n as long as you're not hurting anybody,\n\n2:37:52.700 --> 2:37:54.580\n and it doesn't matter.\n\n2:37:54.580 --> 2:37:55.580\n So it's Austin, anyway.\n\n2:37:55.580 --> 2:37:59.060\n Austin, yeah, exactly.\n\n2:37:59.060 --> 2:38:03.100\n Seems like a to do item for anybody living in Austin,\n\n2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:04.540\n for sure.\n\n2:38:04.540 --> 2:38:07.220\n But the spectrum is an interesting concept\n\n2:38:07.220 --> 2:38:10.420\n because that is, when I say,\n\n2:38:10.420 --> 2:38:12.460\n when I refer to the spectrum,\n\n2:38:12.460 --> 2:38:15.320\n I'm actually referring to, it's a precise clinical term,\n\n2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:17.900\n but you're right, it's been coopted more broadly\n\n2:38:17.900 --> 2:38:20.900\n and it is widely used and it can be\n\n2:38:20.900 --> 2:38:22.500\n an unfair categorization of someone\n\n2:38:22.500 --> 2:38:25.860\n who's socially and occupationally very healthy.\n\n2:38:25.860 --> 2:38:28.140\n And that is critical\n\n2:38:29.740 --> 2:38:32.260\n because we don't define a disorder\n\n2:38:32.260 --> 2:38:34.740\n unless there's social or occupational dysfunction.\n\n2:38:34.740 --> 2:38:36.820\n It doesn't matter what the symptoms are.\n\n2:38:36.820 --> 2:38:39.740\n I've had patients who are pleasantly hallucinating,\n\n2:38:39.740 --> 2:38:43.140\n so frankly, psychotic, but doesn't affect their lives,\n\n2:38:43.140 --> 2:38:46.400\n so I don't give that person a diagnosis\n\n2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:49.980\n because there's not social or occupational dysfunction.\n\n2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:53.620\n Same with anything on this,\n\n2:38:53.620 --> 2:38:57.320\n any of the diverse symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.\n\n2:38:58.580 --> 2:38:59.980\n If someone has them,\n\n2:38:59.980 --> 2:39:03.140\n but they're successful socially and occupationally,\n\n2:39:03.140 --> 2:39:05.620\n we don't say that there's a disorder.\n\n2:39:05.620 --> 2:39:07.700\n But then you're right, that the concept of the spectrum\n\n2:39:07.700 --> 2:39:12.700\n does become a useful pigeonholing device,\n\n2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:15.500\n which is maybe not the best thing.\n\n2:39:15.500 --> 2:39:19.980\n Yeah, and the eye contact is an interesting one,\n\n2:39:19.980 --> 2:39:21.180\n is an interesting one.\n\n2:39:21.180 --> 2:39:22.260\n I'm torn on it.\n\n2:39:23.780 --> 2:39:25.900\n I'm torn about the usefulness of eye contact\n\n2:39:25.900 --> 2:39:27.460\n because people kind of make fun of it,\n\n2:39:27.460 --> 2:39:31.660\n but let me just say one thing about eye contact\n\n2:39:31.660 --> 2:39:33.180\n and about life in general.\n\n2:39:33.180 --> 2:39:34.720\n It's okay to be weird,\n\n2:39:36.900 --> 2:39:39.420\n but like some people, when you have your eyes closed\n\n2:39:39.420 --> 2:39:41.740\n and there's that weird, what is happening to this creature?\n\n2:39:41.740 --> 2:39:44.860\n Like you see a weird creature on the side of the road.\n\n2:39:44.860 --> 2:39:46.340\n It's interesting.\n\n2:39:46.340 --> 2:39:49.120\n And you wanna, I mean, the weird stuff,\n\n2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:51.580\n I'm gonna go back to Robin Williams with the,\n\n2:39:51.580 --> 2:39:53.780\n that's the good stuff, right?\n\n2:39:53.780 --> 2:39:56.380\n He has that whole speech about him and his wife\n\n2:39:56.380 --> 2:39:59.280\n and what he loves all the little peculiarities,\n\n2:39:59.280 --> 2:40:00.180\n all the weird stuff.\n\n2:40:00.180 --> 2:40:04.220\n And that, like let those flourish.\n\n2:40:04.220 --> 2:40:06.420\n Let those, like celebrate those in yourself\n\n2:40:06.420 --> 2:40:08.580\n and not in some kind of woke way,\n\n2:40:08.580 --> 2:40:10.940\n but in some like very human way.\n\n2:40:10.940 --> 2:40:13.060\n This is what makes us, this is the weirdness.\n\n2:40:13.060 --> 2:40:17.380\n Yeah, I'm 100% on board with that.\n\n2:40:17.380 --> 2:40:22.380\n And I don't think, you know, people who are happy\n\n2:40:22.500 --> 2:40:27.140\n and who have people in their lives who are happy with them,\n\n2:40:27.140 --> 2:40:30.500\n these are, I think, let the weirdness flourish.\n\n2:40:30.500 --> 2:40:33.620\n Let the, all the different ways members\n\n2:40:33.620 --> 2:40:35.220\n of the human family can be different.\n\n2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:36.140\n Let's see them all.\n\n2:40:36.140 --> 2:40:38.840\n That's one of our, that's one of the joys of being alive\n\n2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:41.140\n is seeing all the ways we can be human.\n\n2:40:41.140 --> 2:40:43.960\n And I think about it all the time.\n\n2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:48.060\n Why do we have all these ways of being human?\n\n2:40:49.880 --> 2:40:53.000\n And even within one individual,\n\n2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:54.220\n you go through phases of life\n\n2:40:54.220 --> 2:40:57.160\n where you express different sides of your way of being,\n\n2:40:57.160 --> 2:40:59.280\n which is also a pretty fun opportunity, right?\n\n2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:02.880\n You can go through phases where you're in one mode\n\n2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:05.300\n and phases when you're in another mode.\n\n2:41:05.300 --> 2:41:09.720\n And let that, you know, just let that flourish too.\n\n2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:13.360\n Let the ways that you can be you vary as well.\n\n2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:15.720\n I think that's important for people to explore.\n\n2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:19.760\n And I should, like, as if you can address the internet,\n\n2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:25.320\n but I would like to sort of ask the internet\n\n2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:31.400\n to celebrate the weirdness of people.\n\n2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:35.700\n Like, that's, it's the Robin Williams,\n\n2:41:37.580 --> 2:41:39.160\n people call these imperfections,\n\n2:41:39.160 --> 2:41:40.800\n but they're not, that's the good stuff.\n\n2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:43.800\n For any one individual person,\n\n2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:47.680\n find the weird stuff and celebrate it,\n\n2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:50.480\n as opposed to what the internet often does,\n\n2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:55.000\n which is find the weird stuff and criticize it.\n\n2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.580\n Because when you criticize the weird stuff,\n\n2:41:57.580 --> 2:42:01.700\n you're creating conformity, which is another human thing.\n\n2:42:01.700 --> 2:42:05.700\n But that conformity creates a boring world.\n\n2:42:05.700 --> 2:42:10.700\n You want the weird, you want the crazy.\n\n2:42:10.780 --> 2:42:12.580\n That's what fun is made of.\n\n2:42:12.580 --> 2:42:16.220\n That's the foundation of humor\n\n2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:19.020\n and all of the ways in which we deal\n\n2:42:19.020 --> 2:42:21.620\n with the suffering in the world,\n\n2:42:21.620 --> 2:42:23.500\n with the injustices in the world,\n\n2:42:23.500 --> 2:42:28.300\n is like this like huge variety of weird.\n\n2:42:30.900 --> 2:42:32.600\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:34.980\n And that's what, at the depth of psychiatry,\n\n2:42:34.980 --> 2:42:38.780\n is like you wanna acknowledge the weird,\n\n2:42:38.780 --> 2:42:41.860\n celebrate the weird, like step around it\n\n2:42:41.860 --> 2:42:44.980\n to find the particular aspects of weird\n\n2:42:44.980 --> 2:42:47.260\n that are debilitating, like you said.\n\n2:42:47.260 --> 2:42:49.620\n They're somehow negatively affecting your ability\n\n2:42:49.620 --> 2:42:51.100\n to function in the world,\n\n2:42:51.100 --> 2:42:54.700\n as opposed to trying to shut it all down.\n\n2:42:54.700 --> 2:42:55.540\n That's right.\n\n2:42:56.580 --> 2:42:58.420\n Well, on that topic, I mean,\n\n2:42:58.420 --> 2:43:00.700\n I'd love to talk to you about schizophrenia.\n\n2:43:00.700 --> 2:43:04.900\n What is schizophrenia?\n\n2:43:04.900 --> 2:43:07.500\n From your research and from your general understanding,\n\n2:43:07.500 --> 2:43:10.700\n and what is the full landscape of suffering\n\n2:43:10.700 --> 2:43:15.000\n and wisdom that schizophrenia explores?\n\n2:43:15.900 --> 2:43:19.420\n Schizophrenia is a state where\n\n2:43:19.420 --> 2:43:22.300\n there is a break from reality.\n\n2:43:22.300 --> 2:43:25.020\n And so this can show up, as we call them,\n\n2:43:25.020 --> 2:43:27.700\n the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\n2:43:27.700 --> 2:43:29.780\n These include hallucinations,\n\n2:43:29.780 --> 2:43:32.020\n hearing something or seeing something that's not there,\n\n2:43:32.020 --> 2:43:34.660\n usually auditory hallucinations.\n\n2:43:34.660 --> 2:43:38.500\n Paranoia, people can have complex fears.\n\n2:43:38.500 --> 2:43:41.200\n Delusions, which we call fixed false beliefs,\n\n2:43:41.200 --> 2:43:43.380\n people get an extremely unshakable\n\n2:43:43.380 --> 2:43:46.580\n but completely implausible idea about something.\n\n2:43:46.580 --> 2:43:49.880\n Sometimes it relates to themself, sometimes to the world.\n\n2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:51.500\n These we call the positive symptoms,\n\n2:43:51.500 --> 2:43:53.260\n break from reality as we know it.\n\n2:43:54.640 --> 2:43:57.020\n Then there are the negative symptoms that come with it,\n\n2:43:57.020 --> 2:43:59.820\n and these are progressive.\n\n2:43:59.820 --> 2:44:04.460\n These are flattening of emotion, as we call it,\n\n2:44:04.460 --> 2:44:07.540\n so starting to express less and less positive emotion,\n\n2:44:07.540 --> 2:44:12.040\n ending more in a neutral or flat state.\n\n2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:16.520\n Thought disorder, inability to work with complex patterns\n\n2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:19.580\n of planning or thinking, so you can't make plans,\n\n2:44:19.580 --> 2:44:21.200\n you'd have poor working memory,\n\n2:44:21.200 --> 2:44:25.420\n you can't keep track of where you were in a conversation,\n\n2:44:25.420 --> 2:44:26.920\n in a sequence of actions.\n\n2:44:27.820 --> 2:44:32.820\n So poor and impaired working with the thoughts of oneself\n\n2:44:34.620 --> 2:44:37.980\n and then these positive symptoms of break from reality.\n\n2:44:37.980 --> 2:44:41.100\n Okay, now why do these come together?\n\n2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:44.060\n What's the neurobiology of it?\n\n2:44:44.060 --> 2:44:45.380\n Again, we don't know.\n\n2:44:45.380 --> 2:44:48.020\n Schizophrenia, extremely genetically determined.\n\n2:44:48.020 --> 2:44:48.860\n If you look at the numbers,\n\n2:44:48.860 --> 2:44:51.920\n could be upwards of 80% genetically determined.\n\n2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:56.920\n 1% of the human population around the world,\n\n2:44:57.240 --> 2:44:58.840\n it's universal, okay?\n\n2:44:58.840 --> 2:45:00.880\n It's not confined to any one culture,\n\n2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:04.640\n not even really biased in one culture or another,\n\n2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:06.200\n about 1% around the world.\n\n2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:12.360\n And has this progressive quality to it, untreated,\n\n2:45:12.480 --> 2:45:13.560\n so it's very interesting.\n\n2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:17.080\n There's a break that happens, we call it first break,\n\n2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:22.080\n when someone experiences their first disruption of reality,\n\n2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:25.160\n they can have a completely typical life up until that point.\n\n2:45:25.160 --> 2:45:28.200\n So you might have a, and I've seen just heartbreaking cases\n\n2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:31.560\n of like this in the Stanford emergency room\n\n2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:33.160\n where a kid has come there,\n\n2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:37.660\n who's been extremely high functioning in that sense\n\n2:45:37.660 --> 2:45:41.720\n of academic achievement and athletic and interpersonal,\n\n2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:43.360\n and then comes to college.\n\n2:45:43.360 --> 2:45:47.600\n Usually in men, it's around 18, 19 when the first break\n\n2:45:47.600 --> 2:45:52.520\n happens, some terrifying paranoia hits\n\n2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:55.240\n or some auditory hallucinations start.\n\n2:45:55.240 --> 2:45:57.760\n They're getting screamed at by a voice in their head.\n\n2:45:57.760 --> 2:45:59.520\n So devastating.\n\n2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:02.800\n With women, comes on also often a little later,\n\n2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:06.120\n sometimes in the 20s, and it can be progressive.\n\n2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:09.640\n If it's not treated, it just progresses and progresses.\n\n2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:14.120\n The voices become overwhelming, the delusions\n\n2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:16.740\n and paranoia extend and expand.\n\n2:46:16.740 --> 2:46:18.360\n The thought, the negative symptoms particularly\n\n2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:20.360\n become more and more severe.\n\n2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:23.120\n So one can't even maintain thoughts\n\n2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:24.860\n in any sort of ordered fashion.\n\n2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:30.040\n And then eventually, it can be fatal,\n\n2:46:30.040 --> 2:46:33.720\n it can lead to suicide, it can lead to erratic behavior\n\n2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:35.480\n that leads to accidents.\n\n2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:38.840\n Now, it can be treated.\n\n2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:42.200\n There are medications that help, fortunately.\n\n2:46:42.200 --> 2:46:44.040\n They have side effects, so they're not perfect.\n\n2:46:44.040 --> 2:46:49.040\n You can have movement problems and actually a whole host\n\n2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:51.600\n of different side effects that come from the medications.\n\n2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:55.160\n But we can help people now with schizophrenia\n\n2:46:55.160 --> 2:46:56.580\n very, very significantly.\n\n2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:00.460\n But the amazing thing, and this is emblematic\n\n2:47:00.460 --> 2:47:03.260\n of where psychiatry stands, we don't have\n\n2:47:03.260 --> 2:47:05.760\n the deep understanding, just like with depression,\n\n2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:09.600\n we don't have that heart as a pump level of understanding\n\n2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:11.440\n that we'd like to have with schizophrenia,\n\n2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:15.360\n despite it being so biological, so genetic in its nature.\n\n2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:20.360\n So is there a way to return to the other side\n\n2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:22.360\n of the first break?\n\n2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:24.040\n So when you have a break with reality,\n\n2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:27.480\n is there a way to kind of stitch it together?\n\n2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:32.360\n So some people, that works, but we don't really know how.\n\n2:47:32.360 --> 2:47:36.120\n So medications, antipsychotic medications, we call them,\n\n2:47:36.120 --> 2:47:39.220\n they block a particular neurotransmitter receptor\n\n2:47:39.220 --> 2:47:44.240\n called the serotonin 2A receptor,\n\n2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:46.440\n and they modulate dopamine as well\n\n2:47:46.440 --> 2:47:48.280\n and other neurotransmitters.\n\n2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:53.700\n These can take someone who's actively hallucinating,\n\n2:47:53.700 --> 2:47:56.720\n actively paranoid, put them back in a completely normal\n\n2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:01.280\n state, and some people stay that way indefinitely.\n\n2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:04.240\n So you can bring people back from that,\n\n2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:07.240\n back to the other side, have it stitched together.\n\n2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:11.920\n More typically, you'll end up in some intermediate state\n\n2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:15.440\n where symptoms are reduced powerfully,\n\n2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:16.960\n but there might be still something there\n\n2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:19.480\n and you've got a drop down in functioning\n\n2:48:19.480 --> 2:48:22.020\n that may be persistent for a while.\n\n2:48:22.020 --> 2:48:26.080\n But concepts, what physically is going on?\n\n2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:31.080\n One idea is that it's communication within the brain.\n\n2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:34.800\n One part of the brain is not able to tell\n\n2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:36.400\n other parts of the brain what it's doing.\n\n2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:38.020\n And so the auditory hallucinations\n\n2:48:38.020 --> 2:48:40.240\n are very interesting in this regard.\n\n2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:42.080\n They often have this conversational,\n\n2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:44.280\n inner monologue like quality.\n\n2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:45.440\n As we're walking along the street,\n\n2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:47.180\n we may have an inner monologue,\n\n2:48:47.180 --> 2:48:49.200\n thoughts about what's going on.\n\n2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:50.680\n If we see somebody we don't like,\n\n2:48:50.680 --> 2:48:52.080\n we may have a thought,\n\n2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:54.160\n wish somebody would punch that guy, something like that,\n\n2:48:54.160 --> 2:48:55.300\n or maybe I should punch that guy.\n\n2:48:55.300 --> 2:48:59.920\n But these are so far below where we would ever act\n\n2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:02.320\n or even think of acting,\n\n2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:03.800\n but they're just things that come up.\n\n2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:05.880\n And in people with schizophrenia,\n\n2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:09.920\n those inner thoughts, that inner monologue,\n\n2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:14.920\n is not recognized as the inner monologue of the self.\n\n2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:19.960\n And so it's perceived as something coming from the outside\n\n2:49:20.840 --> 2:49:23.360\n or from inside, but from another entity.\n\n2:49:23.360 --> 2:49:26.000\n Another, oh, another, I thought you meant\n\n2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:29.240\n like another room inside the same building.\n\n2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:31.880\n Another room inside there, yeah.\n\n2:49:31.880 --> 2:49:35.280\n And so that's, so it could be conceptualized\n\n2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:38.320\n as a communication within the brain problem,\n\n2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:40.880\n notifying another part of the brain what's going on.\n\n2:49:40.880 --> 2:49:44.280\n And there's some evidence consistent with that.\n\n2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:45.760\n I don't know if you can help with this,\n\n2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:48.320\n but I sometimes, so I've been talking\n\n2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:50.280\n to quite a few homeless folks recently,\n\n2:49:50.280 --> 2:49:54.120\n just, so what I do is I hang out at night\n\n2:49:56.080 --> 2:49:59.800\n and talk to interesting people.\n\n2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:02.560\n And some of them, and I've known people in the past\n\n2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:03.920\n who suffer from schizophrenia,\n\n2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:07.040\n and some of them, like self, will describe\n\n2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:11.360\n as that as something they suffer from.\n\n2:50:12.440 --> 2:50:14.400\n And they seem to understand something deeply\n\n2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:15.880\n about this world.\n\n2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:17.960\n I don't know if it's correlated\n\n2:50:17.960 --> 2:50:22.960\n or maybe it's another aspect of like depression,\n\n2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:27.720\n all those things that I've encountered in my own life\n\n2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:31.580\n is maybe just the struggle and the suffering\n\n2:50:31.580 --> 2:50:33.180\n has taken you through a life\n\n2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:35.280\n where you think deeply about life.\n\n2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:37.500\n Like there's like self reflection\n\n2:50:37.500 --> 2:50:39.520\n that society forces on you\n\n2:50:39.520 --> 2:50:43.320\n because it's a disorder of some kind.\n\n2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:46.240\n It's interesting, I guess my only sort\n\n2:50:46.240 --> 2:50:48.480\n of anecdotal observation is people who suffer\n\n2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:53.040\n from schizophrenia seem to be very interesting\n\n2:50:53.040 --> 2:50:58.040\n and very thoughtful in a nonlinear way about the world.\n\n2:51:00.080 --> 2:51:02.980\n I've noticed that it's not always positive.\n\n2:51:04.040 --> 2:51:06.560\n There are unusual ways they view the world.\n\n2:51:06.560 --> 2:51:10.000\n It was, but it's always interesting.\n\n2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.680\n That could be conspiratorial thinking too.\n\n2:51:12.680 --> 2:51:15.040\n Like, but like the theories they have\n\n2:51:15.040 --> 2:51:17.080\n about the way the world functions,\n\n2:51:17.080 --> 2:51:20.480\n often very well read, which is also interesting\n\n2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:21.620\n because they're almost like looking\n\n2:51:21.620 --> 2:51:23.640\n for helpful answers from somewhere.\n\n2:51:23.640 --> 2:51:24.540\n Absolutely there.\n\n2:51:24.540 --> 2:51:26.440\n And so they're, they might be citing\n\n2:51:26.440 --> 2:51:27.920\n some very interesting literature\n\n2:51:27.920 --> 2:51:32.760\n and then using that to, there's a stickiness\n\n2:51:32.760 --> 2:51:34.800\n in their mind to different models of the world\n\n2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:36.640\n and trying to make sense of that world.\n\n2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:39.080\n And those models could include conspiracy theories.\n\n2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:42.400\n Yeah, they're very attuned to complexity\n\n2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:44.960\n and they come up with unlikely explanations,\n\n2:51:46.180 --> 2:51:48.440\n which is one of the things that makes them,\n\n2:51:48.440 --> 2:51:50.520\n it makes it hard for them to function in the world\n\n2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:53.040\n is how unlikely their explanations are.\n\n2:51:53.040 --> 2:51:55.800\n But you're right, there's a depth of consideration\n\n2:51:55.800 --> 2:51:59.520\n of the complexity of the world and a concern about it\n\n2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:04.640\n and a work, an impulse to work to understand it\n\n2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:07.080\n that is actually quite refreshing.\n\n2:52:07.080 --> 2:52:11.120\n But the first case in the medical literature,\n\n2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:15.280\n there was a classical schizophrenia.\n\n2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:17.880\n There was a patient named James Tilly Matthews\n\n2:52:17.880 --> 2:52:22.380\n who had this, he sketched out for his doctor\n\n2:52:22.380 --> 2:52:26.560\n the experiences he was sensing\n\n2:52:26.560 --> 2:52:31.080\n and he drew himself as a cowering figure\n\n2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:34.600\n on the ground controlled by a loom,\n\n2:52:34.600 --> 2:52:37.840\n a weaving device that was sending threads,\n\n2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:40.840\n long threads, projections across space\n\n2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:44.080\n from the loom to him, to his arms and to his body\n\n2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:46.800\n and controlling him from afar.\n\n2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:51.720\n And he called this the air loom, a loom in the air.\n\n2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:54.200\n And it was such an evocative thing\n\n2:52:54.200 --> 2:52:56.640\n because this was the start of the Industrial Revolution\n\n2:52:56.640 --> 2:53:01.280\n or mid and it was where really industrial strength,\n\n2:53:01.280 --> 2:53:05.840\n looms and weaving devices were really kind of the emblematic\n\n2:53:05.840 --> 2:53:10.280\n of the most complex, powerful technological achievements\n\n2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:13.280\n of the time and so that was the explanation available\n\n2:53:13.280 --> 2:53:18.040\n to him to explain how his body was seemingly moved\n\n2:53:18.040 --> 2:53:22.040\n without his volition and these days, of course,\n\n2:53:22.040 --> 2:53:25.040\n people with schizophrenia will have more technology\n\n2:53:25.040 --> 2:53:29.020\n appropriate interpretations, they'll have delusions\n\n2:53:29.020 --> 2:53:32.920\n of satellite or alien control or beamed information,\n\n2:53:32.920 --> 2:53:35.060\n very, very common to have this delusion\n\n2:53:35.060 --> 2:53:39.640\n of a government agency sending electromagnetic\n\n2:53:39.640 --> 2:53:43.360\n or radio frequency information to control their limbs.\n\n2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:45.760\n But it's the same thing, whether it's a thread\n\n2:53:45.760 --> 2:53:48.280\n from an Industrial Revolution loom\n\n2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:53.280\n or RF radiation, it's the same thing just adapted\n\n2:53:53.480 --> 2:53:56.400\n to the moment explaining, trying to explain\n\n2:53:56.400 --> 2:53:58.520\n the world they live in and their relationship to the world.\n\n2:53:58.520 --> 2:54:01.160\n But unconstrained by sort of the thing\n\n2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:02.720\n that's socially acceptable,\n\n2:54:02.720 --> 2:54:05.320\n which is both refreshing and dangerous.\n\n2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:06.160\n Yes.\n\n2:54:08.640 --> 2:54:10.880\n I wrote down a question.\n\n2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:12.000\n Why do we cry?\n\n2:54:13.240 --> 2:54:15.200\n Are tears a window to some depths\n\n2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:17.500\n that we ourselves don't know?\n\n2:54:17.500 --> 2:54:19.620\n I almost wanna make fun of myself for that question,\n\n2:54:19.620 --> 2:54:22.600\n but you do talk seriously about crying in the book.\n\n2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:26.280\n In fact, the whole first chapter really tussles\n\n2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:29.240\n with crying as why do we do it, what does it mean,\n\n2:54:29.240 --> 2:54:31.000\n why is it involuntary?\n\n2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:32.560\n It seems like a weakness, right?\n\n2:54:32.560 --> 2:54:35.240\n Because it's so involuntary and it's reflecting\n\n2:54:35.240 --> 2:54:36.740\n something true and inside.\n\n2:54:37.760 --> 2:54:39.120\n At the level of the individual,\n\n2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:40.480\n that seems like a problem, right?\n\n2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:42.560\n Wouldn't it be better if we could control it,\n\n2:54:42.560 --> 2:54:47.560\n if we could not show that emotion when it's not useful,\n\n2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:49.480\n show it when it's useful?\n\n2:54:49.480 --> 2:54:51.800\n But it's not, it's largely involuntary.\n\n2:54:52.880 --> 2:54:55.540\n And so there's a value to it, I think,\n\n2:54:55.540 --> 2:54:59.040\n as an honest reporter of a need,\n\n2:54:59.040 --> 2:55:03.520\n of hope and frailty at the same time.\n\n2:55:03.520 --> 2:55:08.520\n I am a human being, there's a frailty to myself\n\n2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:12.280\n or my situation where I need social help,\n\n2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:14.680\n I need help from my community.\n\n2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:16.760\n I have hope that that is possible,\n\n2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:21.520\n but I'm not enough for myself, I need the community.\n\n2:55:21.520 --> 2:55:25.400\n That I think is what the social signal of crying is.\n\n2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:29.280\n Now people have studied crying, it's an extreme,\n\n2:55:29.280 --> 2:55:33.240\n you can quantify the extent to which the presence of tears\n\n2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:37.920\n on a face triggers reactions in onlookers.\n\n2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:41.040\n And you can show the same face in the presence\n\n2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:44.320\n or absence of tears and show that to people\n\n2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:49.320\n under quantifiable and rigorous psychological conditions.\n\n2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:53.280\n And tears are much more powerful at stirring\n\n2:55:53.280 --> 2:55:57.040\n the desire to help in viewers\n\n2:55:57.040 --> 2:56:01.120\n than any other facial feature.\n\n2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:04.000\n Which is pretty interesting that it's the honest one\n\n2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:05.640\n that's also the most powerful, right?\n\n2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:07.720\n It kind of indicates there's a certain logic\n\n2:56:07.720 --> 2:56:11.240\n to our design as social beings\n\n2:56:11.240 --> 2:56:13.680\n that we have an honest report.\n\n2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:17.160\n That's hard to control.\n\n2:56:17.160 --> 2:56:21.520\n But is it well understood how that connects\n\n2:56:21.520 --> 2:56:26.360\n to the internal state of emotion?\n\n2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:30.480\n Yeah, there are long range projections that come,\n\n2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:31.840\n so where is crying generated?\n\n2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:33.200\n This is the confusing thing about it.\n\n2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:36.600\n So that we have a little tear duct, the lacrimal gland\n\n2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:38.080\n that leads to the release of fluid,\n\n2:56:38.080 --> 2:56:40.360\n it ejects fluid and it comes out.\n\n2:56:40.360 --> 2:56:43.440\n And those of course, that whole system was designed\n\n2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:47.040\n to keep the eye clean, to wash out particulate irritants.\n\n2:56:47.040 --> 2:56:49.760\n So it's a long standing, as long as we've had eyes\n\n2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:52.840\n and have been out of the water in our evolution,\n\n2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:53.960\n we've needed this sort of thing.\n\n2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:56.120\n So long standing biological structure,\n\n2:56:56.120 --> 2:56:59.960\n recently co opted it seems by our evolution\n\n2:56:59.960 --> 2:57:02.040\n as social primates.\n\n2:57:02.920 --> 2:57:03.880\n Now, how could that happen?\n\n2:57:03.880 --> 2:57:07.560\n Well, the lacrimal gland is controlled by structures\n\n2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:10.280\n in the pons, which is a structure deep in our,\n\n2:57:11.200 --> 2:57:14.120\n just above our neck, between our neck and our head.\n\n2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:16.760\n And reflecting its ancient origin, right?\n\n2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:18.560\n As you go farther down toward the spinal cord,\n\n2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:21.840\n these are the more basic early evolved structures.\n\n2:57:21.840 --> 2:57:25.240\n And in the pons, that's where breathing is controlled,\n\n2:57:25.240 --> 2:57:30.240\n tear duct contraction.\n\n2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:34.000\n And what we found and with optogenetics,\n\n2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:35.360\n we helped sort this out,\n\n2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:36.760\n there are long range projections\n\n2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:40.960\n from fear and anxiety regions in the forebrain\n\n2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:43.360\n that project all the way to the pons\n\n2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:45.360\n in and around those areas.\n\n2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:47.280\n The reason those are there,\n\n2:57:47.280 --> 2:57:50.720\n we think is to regulate the respiratory rate changes,\n\n2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:52.960\n the breathing changes of fear and anxiety.\n\n2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:55.720\n So we know when we're in a state of fear and anxiety,\n\n2:57:55.720 --> 2:57:58.840\n we need, we cope better if we have elevated heart rate,\n\n2:57:58.840 --> 2:58:01.480\n elevated respiratory rate, more blood pumping around,\n\n2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:02.440\n more oxygenated blood,\n\n2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:05.040\n we're ready to meet the threat if it happens.\n\n2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:07.480\n All those cells are down there in the pons too,\n\n2:58:07.480 --> 2:58:12.480\n right next to the lacrimal duct, the tear gland neurons.\n\n2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:17.480\n And so almost certainly this fear anxiety induced crying\n\n2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:22.480\n arose from a very slightly misdirected long range projection\n\n2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:27.520\n that was there to regulate breathing.\n\n2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:29.800\n And a little twist, just a little misdirection,\n\n2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:33.640\n a little missing of one sign post to stop here,\n\n2:58:33.640 --> 2:58:35.320\n going on a little farther,\n\n2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:38.920\n getting to the lacrimal gland neurons gave us crying.\n\n2:58:38.920 --> 2:58:40.400\n And that's, and we just have it,\n\n2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:43.680\n that peculiar sort of structure, neuronal structure\n\n2:58:43.680 --> 2:58:46.680\n that resulted in that, that's what we're stuck with.\n\n2:58:46.680 --> 2:58:50.000\n And that ends up being, in terms of social interaction,\n\n2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:53.880\n one of the more important, authentic,\n\n2:58:53.880 --> 2:58:57.040\n involuntary displays of interstate.\n\n2:58:57.040 --> 2:58:57.880\n That's right.\n\n2:58:57.880 --> 2:58:58.920\n And social communication.\n\n2:58:58.920 --> 2:58:59.760\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:59.760 --> 2:59:04.000\n Oh, yeah, is there other stuff like that?\n\n2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:08.160\n I mean, do you, yeah, I mean, the human face is fascinating\n\n2:59:08.160 --> 2:59:12.280\n as a display of emotion, as a display of truth and lying\n\n2:59:12.280 --> 2:59:13.880\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:18.880\n I personally, I mean, we're all, I suppose,\n\n2:59:19.560 --> 2:59:24.160\n have different sensors that are sensitive\n\n2:59:24.160 --> 2:59:25.720\n to certain aspects of the human face.\n\n2:59:25.720 --> 2:59:28.320\n But to me, it seems like the eyes\n\n2:59:28.320 --> 2:59:31.240\n are really important communication or something.\n\n2:59:31.240 --> 2:59:33.160\n You know, I've talked to a few sort of girls\n\n2:59:33.160 --> 2:59:35.320\n about like Botox and stuff like that.\n\n2:59:35.320 --> 2:59:37.560\n And it always bothers me when,\n\n2:59:37.560 --> 2:59:38.800\n I guess guys can do this too,\n\n2:59:38.800 --> 2:59:43.440\n but like when women speak negatively\n\n2:59:43.440 --> 2:59:46.280\n of, I guess you can call them wrinkles,\n\n2:59:46.280 --> 2:59:49.760\n at the tips of an eye.\n\n2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:54.440\n But like to me, when you smile, when you wink,\n\n2:59:54.440 --> 2:59:58.040\n not wink, but like narrow the eyes,\n\n2:59:58.040 --> 3:00:00.320\n something is communicated and those,\n\n3:00:00.320 --> 3:00:03.120\n that stuff is really useful, the human face.\n\n3:00:03.120 --> 3:00:05.400\n And when it's gone, something is missing.\n\n3:00:05.400 --> 3:00:08.560\n And a lot of little stuff, it feels like it really,\n\n3:00:08.560 --> 3:00:10.680\n it's almost involuntary, I guess,\n\n3:00:10.680 --> 3:00:12.860\n but it's harder to describe as the presence\n\n3:00:12.860 --> 3:00:13.920\n or absence of tears.\n\n3:00:13.920 --> 3:00:16.600\n It's like something about this person,\n\n3:00:16.600 --> 3:00:18.840\n you can tell they're not bullshitting you.\n\n3:00:18.840 --> 3:00:19.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:21.940\n And so that was what made, presumably,\n\n3:00:21.940 --> 3:00:24.840\n that tear recruitment so powerful,\n\n3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:28.420\n is it just landed in this very high value real estate\n\n3:00:28.420 --> 3:00:29.780\n for social communication.\n\n3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:31.640\n If it had gone to, you know,\n\n3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:34.000\n there's a lot of neurons in the pons\n\n3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:39.000\n that control movement of large muscles elsewhere,\n\n3:00:40.180 --> 3:00:41.620\n that would have been much less effective\n\n3:00:41.620 --> 3:00:43.440\n as a social signal than something around the eye.\n\n3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:46.800\n So it was, however that little misdirection happened,\n\n3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:50.420\n it landed in a great area for social communication.\n\n3:00:50.420 --> 3:00:53.400\n And because it was coming from the fear and anxiety circuits\n\n3:00:53.400 --> 3:00:57.000\n that regulate that necessary involuntary change\n\n3:00:57.000 --> 3:00:59.640\n in heart rate and respiratory rate,\n\n3:00:59.640 --> 3:01:02.440\n it also was involuntary and that became valuable\n\n3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:05.880\n as a truth signal, as social beings.\n\n3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:08.480\n So very interesting when you think about\n\n3:01:08.480 --> 3:01:09.680\n the origins of the human family,\n\n3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:12.480\n the origins of social structures\n\n3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:14.920\n and our ability and need to call for help\n\n3:01:14.920 --> 3:01:18.080\n when there's hope, but need at the same time.\n\n3:01:20.520 --> 3:01:23.080\n What is consciousness, Carl?\n\n3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:26.560\n So you're actually using techniques.\n\n3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:28.360\n I mean, even putting psychiatry aside,\n\n3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:31.760\n just looking at optogenetics,\n\n3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:34.440\n you're trying to understand some of these deep aspects\n\n3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:36.040\n of the human mind.\n\n3:01:36.040 --> 3:01:38.380\n And maybe this is a good time to return to a question\n\n3:01:38.380 --> 3:01:41.160\n you mentioned you might have an opinion on\n\n3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:43.260\n if there's such a thing as a theory of everything\n\n3:01:43.260 --> 3:01:44.920\n for the human mind.\n\n3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:47.800\n Because surely answering of what is consciousness\n\n3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:50.920\n is as, well, that's not sure.\n\n3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:53.480\n But it seems like it's a fundamental part\n\n3:01:53.480 --> 3:01:56.160\n of the human experience in the human mind\n\n3:01:56.160 --> 3:02:00.680\n and solving that question will result in solving\n\n3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:02.620\n the bigger thing about the human mind.\n\n3:02:02.620 --> 3:02:05.000\n The flip side could be consciousness\n\n3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.680\n is just the few neurons that are generating\n\n3:02:07.680 --> 3:02:10.080\n some useful thing that make us,\n\n3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:12.920\n it's like the sense of self\n\n3:02:12.920 --> 3:02:16.280\n that you talked about in the mice.\n\n3:02:16.280 --> 3:02:18.620\n Maybe it's a subset of those cells\n\n3:02:18.620 --> 3:02:21.080\n that are just creating a richer sense of self\n\n3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:21.920\n and that's it.\n\n3:02:22.900 --> 3:02:26.240\n So this is a great question.\n\n3:02:26.240 --> 3:02:28.080\n All neuroscientists think about this\n\n3:02:28.080 --> 3:02:29.840\n and a lot of non neuroscientists too.\n\n3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:34.040\n It's the reason a lot of people came to the study\n\n3:02:34.040 --> 3:02:36.080\n of the brain is to think about consciousness\n\n3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:38.360\n and not just being awake or alert\n\n3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:40.480\n but really what's sometimes called\n\n3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:42.240\n the hard problem of consciousness\n\n3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:45.880\n which is what is that nature of that inner\n\n3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:47.800\n subjective sense we have?\n\n3:02:47.800 --> 3:02:50.080\n Not just information processing\n\n3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:54.960\n but feeling something about the information.\n\n3:02:54.960 --> 3:02:59.120\n What is that inner state of subjectivity physically?\n\n3:02:59.120 --> 3:02:59.960\n What is it?\n\n3:03:00.880 --> 3:03:03.320\n And that's called the hard problem of consciousness\n\n3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:08.320\n and it's not a extremely well defined question.\n\n3:03:08.560 --> 3:03:11.340\n Everybody has sort of a sense of what it means\n\n3:03:11.340 --> 3:03:14.200\n but it's such a hard problem\n\n3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:17.120\n because you run into paradoxes quite quickly\n\n3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:18.440\n the more you think about it\n\n3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:21.800\n and that is exciting also\n\n3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:23.320\n because it makes us think\n\n3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:25.080\n actually there's some fundamental,\n\n3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:28.120\n there's a big thing that we're missing.\n\n3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:30.880\n The brain is not just a collection of little tricks.\n\n3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:32.760\n There is a big, big concept.\n\n3:03:32.760 --> 3:03:34.000\n So that's your sense of the big\n\n3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:37.600\n because a flip side could be with optogenetics.\n\n3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:40.320\n You can, there's an engineering question.\n\n3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:43.920\n Can you turn consciousness on and off like a light switch?\n\n3:03:43.920 --> 3:03:47.200\n Okay, so here's where exactly consciousness\n\n3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:48.920\n frames the problem extremely well\n\n3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:50.580\n and it frames it the following way.\n\n3:03:50.580 --> 3:03:54.680\n So I told you earlier that we can stimulate\n\n3:03:54.680 --> 3:03:59.600\n 20 or 25 cells in the visual cortex of a mouse\n\n3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:03.520\n and we can make it behave and we can make its brain act\n\n3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:06.040\n as if it's seeing something that isn't there.\n\n3:04:06.040 --> 3:04:07.240\n We have that level of control now.\n\n3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:10.920\n We can pick out 25 neurons, play in activity\n\n3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.080\n and both behavior and in the brain,\n\n3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.120\n it's as if it's seeing something specific.\n\n3:04:16.120 --> 3:04:18.600\n Okay, now let's do a thought experiment,\n\n3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:21.840\n you know, a Gedanken experiment and let's play this out.\n\n3:04:22.760 --> 3:04:24.380\n Let's say we could do the same thing\n\n3:04:24.380 --> 3:04:27.880\n for every single neuron in the brain of a human being.\n\n3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:30.120\n Let's say we had total control\n\n3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:31.520\n and I could do something like,\n\n3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:34.800\n I could show you a rich deep color red\n\n3:04:34.800 --> 3:04:36.480\n and you could look at it and you would be aware\n\n3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:38.240\n that it's red, but also you might have some feelings\n\n3:04:38.240 --> 3:04:40.320\n about it, something would be stirred in you,\n\n3:04:40.320 --> 3:04:43.400\n some subjective sense as you looked at that rich color red\n\n3:04:44.720 --> 3:04:48.880\n and then I would take away the visual stimulus\n\n3:04:48.880 --> 3:04:50.340\n and I would, in this thought experiment,\n\n3:04:50.340 --> 3:04:53.300\n I would, using some hyperoptogenetics,\n\n3:04:53.300 --> 3:04:57.000\n I would play in exactly the same pattern of activity\n\n3:04:57.000 --> 3:05:00.360\n in every cell in your brain for as long as was needed,\n\n3:05:00.360 --> 3:05:03.360\n whatever, 15 seconds, something like that,\n\n3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:06.880\n that exactly matched what was going on\n\n3:05:06.880 --> 3:05:10.320\n when you were feeling that inner subjective sense.\n\n3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:12.160\n Okay, so in that thought experiment,\n\n3:05:12.160 --> 3:05:16.320\n a question for you is would you be feeling\n\n3:05:16.320 --> 3:05:18.080\n that same inner subjective sense?\n\n3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:20.560\n Stimulus is gone, every neuron's doing the same thing\n\n3:05:20.560 --> 3:05:21.960\n because I'm controlling it.\n\n3:05:23.040 --> 3:05:25.800\n There's a philosophical question there.\n\n3:05:25.800 --> 3:05:29.360\n If you ask me specifically, I would say yes.\n\n3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:31.400\n Okay, good, most people would say that\n\n3:05:31.400 --> 3:05:33.740\n because it's hard to say no, right?\n\n3:05:33.740 --> 3:05:34.800\n It's very hard to say no.\n\n3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:38.240\n If every cell in your brain is doing what it was doing,\n\n3:05:38.240 --> 3:05:39.560\n what else could be different?\n\n3:05:39.560 --> 3:05:42.720\n How could? Well, most normal people would say yes.\n\n3:05:42.720 --> 3:05:46.320\n Of course, philosophers would then start saying no.\n\n3:05:46.320 --> 3:05:48.240\n They're the ones that say,\n\n3:05:50.460 --> 3:05:53.040\n I'm in sort of parallel and sorry\n\n3:05:53.040 --> 3:05:54.240\n if it's a bit of an interruption,\n\n3:05:54.240 --> 3:05:58.400\n but if there's a robot that's conscious in front of you,\n\n3:05:58.400 --> 3:06:02.900\n if it appears conscious, then it's conscious.\n\n3:06:02.900 --> 3:06:07.300\n Like to me, of course, philosophers again speak up\n\n3:06:07.300 --> 3:06:10.040\n and say, well, no, how do you know it's conscious?\n\n3:06:10.040 --> 3:06:12.360\n Well, how do you know anything is conscious?\n\n3:06:12.360 --> 3:06:15.460\n And sort of as normal humans,\n\n3:06:15.460 --> 3:06:19.160\n we tend to lean on the experience\n\n3:06:19.160 --> 3:06:22.640\n versus some kind of philosophical concept.\n\n3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:25.320\n So the great thing about what you just said,\n\n3:06:25.320 --> 3:06:28.400\n the Turing test is it's very practical.\n\n3:06:28.400 --> 3:06:31.000\n If it acts conscious, it is conscious.\n\n3:06:31.000 --> 3:06:32.880\n But I think that's limiting.\n\n3:06:32.880 --> 3:06:34.760\n I like the thought experiment.\n\n3:06:34.760 --> 3:06:36.240\n I think it's actually more informative.\n\n3:06:36.240 --> 3:06:39.760\n And so I'm halfway to the conclusion there,\n\n3:06:39.760 --> 3:06:43.240\n but let's take it as your answer was yes,\n\n3:06:43.240 --> 3:06:44.920\n that you would be feeling the same thing.\n\n3:06:44.920 --> 3:06:47.120\n Okay, now here's where it gets fun.\n\n3:06:47.120 --> 3:06:52.120\n Now that every cell in your brain knows what it has to do\n\n3:06:55.480 --> 3:06:58.080\n in the sense that we know it and we're providing it,\n\n3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:02.600\n your brain cells don't need to be in your head\n\n3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:04.680\n anymore at all, right?\n\n3:07:04.680 --> 3:07:06.440\n The only reason they're next to each other,\n\n3:07:06.440 --> 3:07:08.120\n the only reason they're wired together\n\n3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:12.200\n is to affect each other, to stimulate or inhibit each other.\n\n3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:13.580\n But we don't need that anymore\n\n3:07:13.580 --> 3:07:15.280\n because optogenetically,\n\n3:07:15.280 --> 3:07:17.280\n we're providing that activity pattern\n\n3:07:17.280 --> 3:07:18.120\n for as long as needed.\n\n3:07:18.120 --> 3:07:20.000\n We're providing the effect of the communication.\n\n3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:22.600\n They don't need to be connected anymore.\n\n3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:24.480\n They don't even need to be in your head.\n\n3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:28.040\n I could spread your neurons all over the continent,\n\n3:07:28.040 --> 3:07:29.200\n all over the galaxy,\n\n3:07:30.200 --> 3:07:34.040\n and I could still provide the same stimulus pattern\n\n3:07:34.040 --> 3:07:36.760\n over 10 or 15 seconds to all those neurons.\n\n3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:41.560\n And somewhere Lex Friedman would have to be,\n\n3:07:41.560 --> 3:07:45.280\n even though no longer existing as a physical object anymore,\n\n3:07:45.280 --> 3:07:48.240\n would be feeling that subjective feeling.\n\n3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:49.080\n And it's inescapable\n\n3:07:49.080 --> 3:07:52.040\n because it's exactly the same as the previous situation.\n\n3:07:52.040 --> 3:07:54.360\n All the neurons have to be spatially,\n\n3:07:55.320 --> 3:07:56.840\n like the locality constraint,\n\n3:07:56.840 --> 3:07:58.920\n they have to be spatially close to each other.\n\n3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:03.680\n And you talk about light opto,\n\n3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:08.680\n which is funny because light is the fastest traveling thing\n\n3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:10.320\n that we know of.\n\n3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:13.080\n Maybe let's not put them all over the universe\n\n3:08:13.080 --> 3:08:14.680\n because we might get relativistic problems then.\n\n3:08:14.680 --> 3:08:15.800\n Let's just keep them out.\n\n3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:17.000\n Let's keep all your neurons.\n\n3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.240\n Let's spread them over North America, okay?\n\n3:08:19.240 --> 3:08:22.720\n And let's play them out, same pattern of activity.\n\n3:08:22.720 --> 3:08:24.200\n And right, it seems absurd, right?\n\n3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:25.960\n There's no way that could be true.\n\n3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:28.720\n There's no way that Lex would be feeling\n\n3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:29.760\n that internal sense\n\n3:08:29.760 --> 3:08:32.800\n if his neurons were spread all over North America.\n\n3:08:32.800 --> 3:08:35.200\n And yet it's exactly the same as the previous situation\n\n3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:37.000\n where you said, sure.\n\n3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:38.000\n So we've got a paradox.\n\n3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:39.320\n And this is what makes people think.\n\n3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:40.880\n Is it a paradox though, sorry?\n\n3:08:40.880 --> 3:08:42.600\n Well, maybe paradox is the wrong word.\n\n3:08:42.600 --> 3:08:44.000\n We got a problem.\n\n3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:46.120\n We got a problem because it reveals\n\n3:08:46.120 --> 3:08:49.840\n that there's something big about those,\n\n3:08:49.840 --> 3:08:53.100\n that internal subjective state that we're not explaining.\n\n3:08:53.100 --> 3:08:54.680\n And we don't really have a hope of explaining\n\n3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:55.720\n in the near future.\n\n3:08:55.720 --> 3:08:58.680\n But don't you think we would still have that?\n\n3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:00.580\n It's just the word internal loses meaning,\n\n3:09:00.580 --> 3:09:02.200\n but don't you think we still have\n\n3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:04.360\n that internal subjective state?\n\n3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:09.360\n Or if not, then where the heck is the magic coming from?\n\n3:09:10.760 --> 3:09:12.460\n Okay, well, I just think,\n\n3:09:13.440 --> 3:09:16.840\n I think one of the problems\n\n3:09:16.840 --> 3:09:19.160\n that I think we need to let go of\n\n3:09:19.160 --> 3:09:23.460\n is we tend to, outside of the experience of consciousness,\n\n3:09:23.460 --> 3:09:25.720\n the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:27.940\n we tend to think that we individual humans\n\n3:09:27.940 --> 3:09:29.180\n are really special.\n\n3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:32.360\n Not the subjective experience,\n\n3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:34.840\n but the entirety of it, like the body\n\n3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:35.800\n that contains the thing.\n\n3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:40.800\n So the local, the constraint of all the stuff\n\n3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:43.320\n has to be together, and it's all mine.\n\n3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:48.640\n That's a very, I don't know if that has anything to do\n\n3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:52.000\n with the mechanisms that are creating this.\n\n3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:56.960\n So in fact, one really nice way to break through that\n\n3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:01.960\n is to either observe or create consciousness\n\n3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:06.160\n that spans multiple organisms.\n\n3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:12.400\n Sort of like, let's say it's not an organism dependent\n\n3:10:14.340 --> 3:10:17.540\n phenomena, that the phenomena can,\n\n3:10:17.540 --> 3:10:22.160\n that's just a peculiar way it has evolved on Earth,\n\n3:10:22.160 --> 3:10:26.320\n but it's a phenomena that doesn't have anything to do\n\n3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:30.520\n with a specific biological system.\n\n3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:35.760\n Right, so and we have different parts of our brain exist\n\n3:10:35.760 --> 3:10:40.760\n and sometimes create complex awarenesses of things\n\n3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:46.360\n that involve different neurons that are distributed widely\n\n3:10:47.400 --> 3:10:49.040\n and that need to communicate with each other\n\n3:10:49.040 --> 3:10:51.240\n to form this joint representation,\n\n3:10:51.240 --> 3:10:53.120\n this state of consciousness.\n\n3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:57.280\n But indeed, why do they have to be in the same head?\n\n3:10:57.280 --> 3:11:01.280\n We don't know why that would be the case that they do.\n\n3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:06.640\n And so that's a huge unanswered question in the field\n\n3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:11.640\n is what is it that binds the activity of neurons together\n\n3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:14.440\n so they can form a joint representation?\n\n3:11:14.440 --> 3:11:16.840\n And actually this comes back to the dissociation experiment\n\n3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:19.360\n we talked about before, where your sense of self\n\n3:11:19.360 --> 3:11:23.480\n becomes separated from your body.\n\n3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:26.600\n Those things that were fused in a joint representation,\n\n3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:29.900\n the same concept, unitary, are now separate.\n\n3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:35.440\n And in late 2020, we published a paper in Nature\n\n3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:37.160\n showing how this could be.\n\n3:11:37.160 --> 3:11:41.000\n We used optogenetics to drive this rhythm\n\n3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:44.000\n that ketamine and PCP cause in retrosplenial cortex\n\n3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:47.520\n and we got different parts of the brain to be out of sync\n\n3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:50.440\n and when they were active, never able to be active\n\n3:11:50.440 --> 3:11:53.680\n at the same time, never able to form\n\n3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:56.120\n a joint representation at the same time.\n\n3:11:56.120 --> 3:11:58.080\n And so we've got a toehold into these questions.\n\n3:11:58.080 --> 3:11:59.920\n We don't have the answers, but.\n\n3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:02.600\n And that mimics the dynamics of ketamine effects.\n\n3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:04.280\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:06.880\n And you're able to find that kind of oscillation.\n\n3:12:08.280 --> 3:12:09.920\n Wow, wow, wow.\n\n3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:13.520\n I see if you get even greater and greater control\n\n3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:16.000\n with more control over individual neurons\n\n3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:19.840\n and understanding, like if you think of certain neurons\n\n3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:24.500\n that having some role to play in the sense of self,\n\n3:12:24.500 --> 3:12:26.180\n you can play like an orchestra.\n\n3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:31.720\n That, to create certain degrees of consciousness,\n\n3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:35.500\n degrees of subjectivity, and thereby understand\n\n3:12:35.500 --> 3:12:37.480\n what is consciousness.\n\n3:12:37.480 --> 3:12:40.880\n But by having a very complicated light switch essentially.\n\n3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:44.780\n And here's the challenge is the nice thing\n\n3:12:44.780 --> 3:12:48.200\n about the thought experiment is it kind of highlights\n\n3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:51.760\n that we're gonna hit a point where\n\n3:12:53.880 --> 3:12:57.380\n we're addressing some very, very fundamental questions.\n\n3:12:57.380 --> 3:13:02.380\n What allows the activity of two sets of neurons\n\n3:13:03.640 --> 3:13:07.080\n to become mutually relevant to each other?\n\n3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:11.560\n This is in some ways maybe one of the deepest\n\n3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:14.600\n remaining questions in neuroscience is what allows\n\n3:13:14.600 --> 3:13:18.900\n activity patterns to become relevant to each other?\n\n3:13:18.900 --> 3:13:21.200\n Do they have to be in sync temporarily?\n\n3:13:21.200 --> 3:13:25.920\n Do they need to be, is there some other quality\n\n3:13:25.920 --> 3:13:28.440\n that we don't know about that also needs to be present\n\n3:13:28.440 --> 3:13:32.140\n to allow cells to fuse together into a joint representation?\n\n3:13:32.140 --> 3:13:37.140\n Just so I understand, because it feels close\n\n3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:39.460\n to some very, very deep idea.\n\n3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:43.600\n So there's a bunch of semi distributed signals\n\n3:13:43.600 --> 3:13:44.840\n going on in the brain.\n\n3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:50.680\n And you're saying there could be something\n\n3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:53.800\n like a theory of everything if one to exist\n\n3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:58.240\n is to understand why, how and why signals\n\n3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:03.240\n close to each other start becoming relevant to each other\n\n3:14:07.040 --> 3:14:10.900\n as part of some very much bigger signal\n\n3:14:10.900 --> 3:14:12.420\n that they're producing.\n\n3:14:12.420 --> 3:14:14.960\n How they coordinate, essentially.\n\n3:14:16.880 --> 3:14:18.440\n Because it's very distributed.\n\n3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:22.440\n I mean that's a kind of, within a distributed system,\n\n3:14:22.440 --> 3:14:24.260\n how is order achieved?\n\n3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:28.840\n And this is a very specific kind of distributed system\n\n3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:32.400\n that is one of the most intelligent that we're aware of\n\n3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:33.880\n in the known universe.\n\n3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:38.280\n In that would maybe be something also,\n\n3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:42.400\n an understanding of the full conscious experience too.\n\n3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:44.440\n That this kind of coordination.\n\n3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:46.640\n How does the coordination between different neurons\n\n3:14:46.640 --> 3:14:49.060\n that are responsible for sense of self,\n\n3:14:49.060 --> 3:14:51.740\n how do they begin to form a big picture\n\n3:14:51.740 --> 3:14:54.080\n that we see as a human experience?\n\n3:14:54.080 --> 3:14:55.520\n That's really, really interesting.\n\n3:14:55.520 --> 3:14:57.160\n So uniting the small and the,\n\n3:14:57.160 --> 3:15:00.960\n I mean that's actually literally theory of everything.\n\n3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:03.840\n Uniting the small, the sort of the theory of the neuron.\n\n3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:07.800\n The functioning of the neuron with the big.\n\n3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:12.060\n Just the functioning of the entire mind.\n\n3:15:12.060 --> 3:15:12.900\n That's right.\n\n3:15:12.900 --> 3:15:14.920\n And I think keeping a toehold in both\n\n3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:17.820\n at the cellular level of resolution\n\n3:15:17.820 --> 3:15:19.720\n and the brain wide resolution will be critical.\n\n3:15:19.720 --> 3:15:21.320\n If you lose touch with either,\n\n3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:23.580\n I think you'll miss the big insight.\n\n3:15:23.580 --> 3:15:25.380\n So that's what we're trying to do.\n\n3:15:25.380 --> 3:15:29.200\n Keeping grounded in the cellular resolution.\n\n3:15:29.200 --> 3:15:32.200\n Trying to keep the broadest brain wide perspective\n\n3:15:32.200 --> 3:15:33.360\n and meet in the middle.\n\n3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:36.920\n Do you think you'll see it in your lifetime?\n\n3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:39.560\n A major breakthrough in that dimension.\n\n3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:40.400\n I have hope.\n\n3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:42.020\n I have hope.\n\n3:15:42.020 --> 3:15:43.760\n It's very hard to predict what will happen\n\n3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:45.480\n with big things like this.\n\n3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:46.800\n If we don't get there,\n\n3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:48.560\n there'll be plenty of other exciting stuff.\n\n3:15:48.560 --> 3:15:49.760\n So it's okay.\n\n3:15:50.760 --> 3:15:52.920\n But the other aspect of this whole thing\n\n3:15:52.920 --> 3:15:55.240\n is that your life is pretty short.\n\n3:15:55.240 --> 3:15:56.640\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n3:15:56.640 --> 3:15:59.440\n So first of all, you can die any day.\n\n3:15:59.440 --> 3:16:01.360\n I tend to try to think about that,\n\n3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:03.900\n that it ends, it can end any moment\n\n3:16:03.900 --> 3:16:05.640\n because it really, really can.\n\n3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:08.760\n And if not, it'll be soon anyway.\n\n3:16:08.760 --> 3:16:09.960\n Do you think about that?\n\n3:16:09.960 --> 3:16:12.260\n Do you think about your mortality?\n\n3:16:12.260 --> 3:16:13.100\n I do, yeah.\n\n3:16:13.100 --> 3:16:16.000\n It comes back to what we talked about earlier.\n\n3:16:16.920 --> 3:16:18.480\n I never think I've done enough\n\n3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:20.880\n and it's relevant to that for sure.\n\n3:16:20.880 --> 3:16:23.460\n There's a deadline.\n\n3:16:25.060 --> 3:16:27.180\n Do you think there's ever going to be a feeling\n\n3:16:27.180 --> 3:16:31.720\n where you sit back and you're really proud of yourself?\n\n3:16:34.200 --> 3:16:35.320\n I hope so.\n\n3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:36.680\n Like, I've done enough.\n\n3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:38.400\n I've done everything there is.\n\n3:16:39.560 --> 3:16:41.080\n Because the thing is,\n\n3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:44.800\n a warrior has some number of battles in them.\n\n3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:47.000\n And at a certain point, if you're deeply honest,\n\n3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:50.240\n it's like, well, that was a pretty good run.\n\n3:16:50.240 --> 3:16:53.040\n As far as runs goes, that was pretty good.\n\n3:16:53.040 --> 3:16:55.240\n And you can hang up your helmet\n\n3:16:55.240 --> 3:17:00.240\n and then go sort of drink some ale,\n\n3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:03.600\n listen to some music with the old lady,\n\n3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:04.920\n and say, I did pretty good.\n\n3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:06.280\n You think you'll get there?\n\n3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:10.320\n You know, with something,\n\n3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:12.960\n nature always has surprises for us.\n\n3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:17.400\n The curious mind is always after more.\n\n3:17:17.400 --> 3:17:21.240\n But biology gives us other rewards.\n\n3:17:22.120 --> 3:17:25.020\n Children and family, community.\n\n3:17:26.040 --> 3:17:28.400\n And one can feel good about those things.\n\n3:17:30.340 --> 3:17:31.740\n Biology is full of rewards.\n\n3:17:31.740 --> 3:17:34.780\n But do you think about those rewards?\n\n3:17:34.780 --> 3:17:37.040\n What do you think is the why of those rewards?\n\n3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:40.200\n What's the meaning of life and this existence?\n\n3:17:40.200 --> 3:17:44.520\n What's the why of biology?\n\n3:17:44.520 --> 3:17:45.460\n What does it want from us?\n\n3:17:45.460 --> 3:17:47.980\n Why are all these cells very busy\n\n3:17:47.980 --> 3:17:49.320\n putting together an organism\n\n3:17:49.320 --> 3:17:53.660\n that seems to want to just be in a hurry to do stuff\n\n3:17:53.660 --> 3:17:57.560\n and survive, but it's not happy being survived.\n\n3:17:57.560 --> 3:17:59.240\n Like you said, it's curious.\n\n3:17:59.240 --> 3:18:01.640\n It keeps wanting to get into more trouble.\n\n3:18:01.640 --> 3:18:02.960\n Why?\n\n3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:07.360\n Yeah, you know, we're clearly designed for that, right?\n\n3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:10.680\n We're clearly designed to ask why and to answer.\n\n3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:12.920\n And that, I think, is,\n\n3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:15.320\n I don't know the meaning of all life.\n\n3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:17.920\n I think a meaning of our lives is that.\n\n3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:22.480\n And this is the Aristotelian happiness.\n\n3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:24.320\n An organism is happy, an animal's happy\n\n3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:26.440\n if it's performing to its design, right?\n\n3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:29.760\n If it's doing what it was made for.\n\n3:18:29.760 --> 3:18:33.680\n Yeah, well, you have to understand, what's the design?\n\n3:18:33.680 --> 3:18:38.680\n And, you know, who is the designer\n\n3:18:39.040 --> 3:18:43.840\n and what were they up to and how hard is it?\n\n3:18:43.840 --> 3:18:45.180\n Do you have to build the whole universe?\n\n3:18:45.180 --> 3:18:47.640\n And does the design even know what the hell they're doing?\n\n3:18:47.640 --> 3:18:51.720\n Because, you know, maybe the designer built humans\n\n3:18:51.720 --> 3:18:56.480\n to find out about themselves.\n\n3:18:56.480 --> 3:18:57.520\n That's what I would do.\n\n3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:00.720\n Like, if I had the power to build clones,\n\n3:19:00.720 --> 3:19:02.480\n I would build a lot of clones\n\n3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:04.840\n and I would get them into different trouble\n\n3:19:04.840 --> 3:19:08.560\n to understand, like, what am I designed,\n\n3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:10.440\n what's this body designed to do?\n\n3:19:10.440 --> 3:19:11.680\n How far can I go that way?\n\n3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:12.880\n Exactly.\n\n3:19:12.880 --> 3:19:15.640\n And then, and I dissociate myself completely\n\n3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:19.000\n from having any way to know, like, that I know that person.\n\n3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:19.980\n Oh, that's good.\n\n3:19:19.980 --> 3:19:21.280\n I mean, I suppose you could do that\n\n3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:26.200\n in a single person's body, but dissociation, you could.\n\n3:19:26.200 --> 3:19:29.280\n Yeah, but I do wonder what,\n\n3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:33.800\n if you look at Earth as a collection of humans,\n\n3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:35.940\n as a collection of biological organisms,\n\n3:19:35.940 --> 3:19:38.920\n it seems that we're busy doing something\n\n3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:45.440\n and it just seems too beautiful and too special\n\n3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:50.440\n to be a random, a random experiment.\n\n3:19:50.440 --> 3:19:55.440\n It seems like it's an experiment that's cleverly designed\n\n3:19:57.080 --> 3:19:58.760\n That's right.\n\n3:19:58.760 --> 3:20:00.640\n by some forces of nature\n\n3:20:00.640 --> 3:20:03.560\n that are beyond our current understanding.\n\n3:20:03.560 --> 3:20:05.520\n And maybe that's part of our design,\n\n3:20:05.520 --> 3:20:06.560\n is to keep asking why.\n\n3:20:06.560 --> 3:20:07.380\n You said answer.\n\n3:20:07.380 --> 3:20:10.380\n I'm not sure that's part of the design, the answer.\n\n3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:15.080\n I think we're given just the sufficiently limited\n\n3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:19.020\n cognitive capability that we know how to long\n\n3:20:19.020 --> 3:20:22.520\n to find the answer and we lack the ability\n\n3:20:22.520 --> 3:20:24.120\n to find the answer.\n\n3:20:24.120 --> 3:20:26.460\n That's basically a summary of your career.\n\n3:20:26.460 --> 3:20:27.800\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:29.480\n And then we give each other Nobel Prizes\n\n3:20:29.480 --> 3:20:33.200\n for having even an inkling of a good step\n\n3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:35.120\n towards the right direction.\n\n3:20:35.120 --> 3:20:37.240\n Carl, you're an incredible human being.\n\n3:20:38.580 --> 3:20:41.000\n I'm a huge fan of who you are as a person,\n\n3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:43.520\n who you are as a scientist, who you are as a writer.\n\n3:20:43.520 --> 3:20:45.300\n I just thank you so much.\n\n3:20:45.300 --> 3:20:46.720\n I'm so honored that you would sit down\n\n3:20:46.720 --> 3:20:47.560\n and talk to me today.\n\n3:20:47.560 --> 3:20:48.380\n It was amazing.\n\n3:20:48.380 --> 3:20:49.840\n It's been incredibly fun.\n\n3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:50.740\n Let's do it again sometime.\n\n3:20:50.740 --> 3:20:51.580\n Let's do it again.\n\n3:20:51.580 --> 3:20:52.400\n It's been really great.\n\n3:20:52.400
