Exchange,\n\n00:05.840 --> 00:08.280\n websites that are visited by millions of people\n\n00:08.280 --> 00:09.560\n every single day.\n\n00:09.560 --> 00:13.880\n Much like with Wikipedia, it is difficult to understate\n\n00:13.880 --> 00:16.680\n the impact on global knowledge and productivity\n\n00:16.680 --> 00:19.520\n that these networks of sites have created.\n\n00:19.520 --> 00:24.000\n Jeff is also the author of the famed blog Coding Horror\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:27.160\n and the founder of Discourse, an open source software\n\n00:27.160 --> 00:31.160\n project that seeks to improve the quality of our online\n\n00:31.160 --> 00:33.440\n community discussions.\n\n00:33.440 --> 00:36.640\n This conversation is part of the MIT course\n\n00:36.640 --> 00:38.480\n on artificial general intelligence\n\n00:38.480 --> 00:40.840\n and the artificial intelligence podcast.\n\n00:40.840 --> 00:43.720\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,\n\n00:43.720 -->

00:56.200\n And now, here's my conversation with Jeff Atwood.\n\n00:56.200 --> 00:59.120\n Having co created and managed for a few years\n\n00:59.120 --> 01:02.960\n the world's largest community of programmers in Stack Overflow\n\n01:02.960 --> 01:08.600\n 10 years ago, what do you think motivates most programmers?\n\n01:08.600 --> 01:13.320\n Is it fame, fortune, glory, process of programming itself,\n\n01:13.320 --> 01:16.440\n or is it the sense of belonging to a community?\n\n01:16.440 --> 01:17.960\n It's puzzles, really.\n\n01:17.960 --> 01:22.320\n I think it's this idea of working on puzzles\n\n01:22.320 --> 01:25.800\n independently of other people and just solving a problem,\n\n01:25.800 --> 01:28.360\n sort of like on your own almost.\n\n01:28.360 --> 01:32.280\n Although, nobody really works alone in programming anymore.\n\n01:32.280 --> 01:36.480\n But I will say there's an aspect of hiding yourself away\n\n01:36.480 --> 01:39.560\n and just beating on a problem until you solve it,\n\n01:39.560 --> 01:41.120\n like brute force basically to me is\n\n01:41.120 --> 01:43.000\n what a lot of programming is.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:44.560\n The computer's so fast that you can\n\n01:44.560 --> 01:46.560\n do things that would take forever for a human,\n\n01:46.560 --> 01:49.200\n but you can just do them so many times and so often\n\n01:49.200 --> 01:52.040\n that you get the answer.\n\n01:52.040 --> 01:55.520\n You're saying just the pure act of tinkering with the code\n\n01:55.520 --> 01:58.680\n is the thing that drives most problems.\n\n01:58.680 --> 02:03.000\n The struggle balance within the joy of overcoming,\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.960\n the brute force process of pain and suffering\n\n02:05.960 --> 02:09.240\n that eventually leads to something that actually works.\n\n02:09.240 --> 02:10.200\n Well, data's fun, too.\n\n02:10.200 --> 02:12.360\n There's this thing called the shuffling problem.\n\n02:12.360 --> 02:14.960\n The naive shuffle that most programmers write\n\n02:14.960 --> 02:16.920\n has a huge flaw, and there's a lot of articles\n\n02:16.920 --> 02:18.920\n online about this because it can be really bad\n\n02:18.920 --> 02:22.040\n if you're a casino and you have an unsophisticated programmer\n\n02:22.040 --> 02:23.480\n writing your shuffle algorithm.\n\n02:23.480 --> 02:25.240\n There's surprising ways to get this wrong,\n\n02:25.240 --> 02:27.240\n but the neat thing is the way to figure that out\n\n02:27.240 --> 02:29.040\n is just to run your shuffle a bunch of times\n\n02:29.040 --> 02:32.200\n and see how many orientations of cards you get.\n\n02:32.200 --> 02:34.680\n You should get an equal distribution of all the cards.\n\n02:34.680 --> 02:36.360\n And with the naive method of shuffling,\n\n02:36.360 --> 02:38.560\n if you just look at the data, if you just brute force it\n\n02:38.560 --> 02:40.880\n and say, OK, I don't know what's going to happen,\n\n02:40.880 --> 02:43.320\n you just write a program that does it a billion times\n\n02:43.320 --> 02:46.040\n and then see what the buckets look like of the data.\n\n02:46.040 --> 02:48.200\n And the Monty Hall problem is another example of that,\n\n02:48.200 --> 02:50.600\n where you have three doors and somebody gives you\n\n02:50.600 --> 02:52.680\n information about another door.\n\n02:52.680 --> 02:54.480\n So the correct answer is you should always\n\n02:54.480 --> 02:56.400\n switch in the Monty Hall problem, which is not intuitive,\n\n02:56.400 --> 02:58.040\n and it freaks people out all the time.\n\n02:58.040 --> 02:59.760\n But you can solve it with data.\n\n02:59.760 --> 03:04.360\n If you write a program that does the Monty Hall game\n\n03:04.360 --> 03:06.840\n and then never switches, then always switches, just compare,\n\n03:06.840 --> 03:09.640\n you would immediately see that you don't have to be smart.\n\n03:09.640 --> 03:11.560\n You don't have to figure out the answer algorithmically.\n\n03:11.560 --> 03:13.360\n You can just brute force it out with data and say, well,\n\n03:13.360 --> 03:15.440\n I know the answer is this because I ran the program\n\n03:15.440 --> 03:17.440\n a billion times, and these are the data buckets\n\n03:17.440 --> 03:18.920\n that I got from it.\n\n03:18.920 --> 03:20.280\n So empirically find it.\n\n03:20.280 --> 03:22.280\n But what's the joy of that?\n\n03:22.280 --> 03:26.320\n So for you, for you personally, outside of family,\n\n03:26.320 --> 03:29.400\n what motivates you in this process?\n\n03:29.400 --> 03:30.960\n Well, to be honest, I don't really\n\n03:30.960 --> 03:32.520\n write a lot of code anymore.\n\n03:32.520 --> 03:35.040\n What I do at Discourse is managery stuff,\n\n03:35.040 --> 03:37.800\n which I always despised.\n\n03:37.800 --> 03:39.200\n As a programmer, you think of managers\n\n03:39.200 --> 03:42.320\n as people who don't really do anything themselves.\n\n03:42.320 --> 03:43.960\n But the weird thing about code is you\n\n03:43.960 --> 03:45.880\n realize that language is code.\n\n03:45.880 --> 03:48.280\n The ability to direct other people\n\n03:48.280 --> 03:50.560\n lets you get more stuff done than you\n\n03:50.560 --> 03:52.240\n could by yourself anyway.\n\n03:52.240 --> 03:53.600\n You said language is code?\n\n03:53.600 --> 03:54.360\n Language is code.\n\n03:54.360 --> 03:56.040\n Meaning communication with other humans?\n\n03:56.040 --> 03:56.840\n Yes, it is.\n\n03:56.840 --> 03:58.480\n You can think of it as a systematic.\n\n03:58.480 --> 04:01.760\n So what is it like to be, what makes,\n\n04:01.760 --> 04:04.280\n before we get into programming, what makes a good manager?\n\n04:04.280 --> 04:05.800\n What makes a good leader?\n\n04:05.800 --> 04:08.280\n Well, I think a leader, it's all about leading by example,\n\n04:08.280 --> 04:11.400\n first of all, sort of doing and being the things\n\n04:11.400 --> 04:12.440\n that you want to be.\n\n04:12.440 --> 04:13.600\n Now, this can be kind of exhausting,\n\n04:13.600 --> 04:14.760\n particularly when you have kids, because you\n\n04:14.760 --> 04:17.760\n realize that your kids are watching you all the time,\n\n04:17.760 --> 04:20.720\n even in ways that you've stopped seeing yourself.\n\n04:20.720 --> 04:23.560\n The hardest person to see on the planet is really yourself.\n\n04:23.560 --> 04:24.560\n It's a lot easier to see other people\n\n04:24.560 --> 04:26.240\n and make judgments about them.\n\n04:26.240 --> 04:28.360\n But yourself, you're super biased.\n\n04:28.360 --> 04:30.840\n You don't actually see yourself the way other people see you.\n\n04:30.840 --> 04:33.000\n Often, you're very, very hard on yourself in a way\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.760\n that other people really aren't going to be.\n\n04:34.760 --> 04:37.880\n So that's one of the insights is you've\n\n04:37.880 --> 04:40.200\n got to be really diligent about thinking,\n\n04:40.200 --> 04:42.360\n am I behaving in a way that represents\n\n04:42.360 --> 04:44.720\n how I want other people to behave,\n\n04:44.720 --> 04:46.120\n like leading through example?\n\n04:46.120 --> 04:47.960\n There's a lot of examples of leaders\n\n04:47.960 --> 04:50.280\n that really mess this up, like they make decisions that\n\n04:50.280 --> 04:54.960\n are like, wow, it's a bad example for other people.\n\n04:54.960 --> 04:57.440\n So I think leading by example is one.\n\n04:57.440 --> 04:59.640\n The other one I believe is working really hard.\n\n04:59.640 --> 05:01.520\n And I don't mean working exhaustively,\n\n05:01.520 --> 05:07.200\n but showing a real passion for the problem,\n\n05:07.200 --> 05:09.000\n not necessarily your solution to the problem,\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.040\n but the problem itself is just one that you really believe in.\n\n05:11.040 --> 05:12.480\n Like with discourse, for example,\n\n05:12.480 --> 05:13.960\n the problem that we're looking at,\n\n05:13.960 --> 05:17.360\n which is my current project, is how do you get people\n\n05:17.360 --> 05:20.040\n in groups to communicate in a way that doesn't break down\n\n05:20.040 --> 05:21.920\n into the howling of wolves?\n\n05:21.920 --> 05:23.600\n How do you deal with trolling?\n\n05:23.600 --> 05:24.920\n Not like technical problems.\n\n05:24.920 --> 05:26.440\n How do I get people to post paragraphs?\n\n05:26.440 --> 05:27.480\n How do I get people to use bold?\n\n05:27.480 --> 05:29.480\n How do I get people to use complete sentences,\n\n05:29.480 --> 05:30.840\n although those are problems as well?\n\n05:30.840 --> 05:33.560\n But how do I get people to get along with each other\n\n05:33.560 --> 05:36.120\n and then solve whatever problem it is they set out to solve,\n\n05:36.120 --> 05:38.280\n or reach some consensus on discussion,\n\n05:38.280 --> 05:39.920\n or just not hurt each other even?\n\n05:39.920 --> 05:41.920\n Maybe it's a discussion that doesn't really matter,\n\n05:41.920 --> 05:43.560\n but are people yelling at each other?\n\n05:43.560 --> 05:44.400\n And why?\n\n05:44.400 --> 05:46.720\n Like that's not the purpose of this kind of communication.\n\n05:46.720 --> 05:51.720\n So I would say leadership is about setting an example,\n\n05:52.960 --> 05:54.880\n doing the things that represent what you want to be,\n\n05:54.880 --> 05:56.760\n and making sure that you're actually doing those things.\n\n05:56.760 --> 05:58.120\n And there's a trick to that too,\n\n05:58.120 --> 05:59.720\n because the things you don't do\n\n05:59.720 --> 06:01.520\n also say a lot about what you are.\n\n06:02.400 --> 06:03.960\n Yeah, so let's pause on that one.\n\n06:03.960 --> 06:05.160\n So those two things are fascinating.\n\n06:05.160 --> 06:08.080\n So how do you have as a leader that self awareness?\n\n06:08.080 --> 06:10.200\n So you just said it's really hard to be self aware.\n\n06:10.200 --> 06:12.880\n So for you personally, or maybe for other leaders\n\n06:12.880 --> 06:14.160\n you've seen or look up to,\n\n06:14.160 --> 06:18.600\n how do you know both that the things you're doing\n\n06:18.600 --> 06:20.000\n are the wrong things to be doing,\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.280\n the way you speak to others, the way you behave,\n\n06:22.280 --> 06:23.600\n and the things you're not doing?\n\n06:23.600 --> 06:24.440\n How do you get that signal?\n\n06:24.440 --> 06:26.360\n I think there's two aspects to that.\n\n06:26.360 --> 06:29.400\n One is like processing feedback that you're getting, so.\n\n06:29.400 --> 06:30.240\n How do you get feedback?\n\n06:30.240 --> 06:32.280\n Well, right, so are you getting feedback, right?\n\n06:32.280 --> 06:33.640\n So one way we do it, for example, with discourse,\n\n06:33.640 --> 06:34.800\n we have three cofounders,\n\n06:34.800 --> 06:37.280\n and we periodically talk about decisions\n\n06:37.280 --> 06:38.120\n before we make them.\n\n06:38.120 --> 06:40.720\n So it's not like one person can make a mistake,\n\n06:40.720 --> 06:43.160\n or like, wow, there can be misunderstandings, things like that.\n\n06:43.160 --> 06:45.520\n So it's part of like group consensus of leadership\n\n06:45.520 --> 06:47.000\n is like it's good to have,\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.320\n I think systems where there's one leader,\n\n06:49.320 --> 06:50.920\n and that leader has the rule of absolute law\n\n06:50.920 --> 06:53.480\n are just really dangerous in my experience.\n\n06:53.480 --> 06:54.560\n For communities, for example,\n\n06:54.560 --> 06:56.120\n like if you have a community that's run by one person,\n\n06:56.120 --> 06:57.480\n that one person makes all the decisions,\n\n06:57.480 --> 06:59.320\n that person's gonna have a bad day.\n\n06:59.320 --> 07:02.480\n Something could happen to that person, something,\n\n07:02.480 --> 07:03.320\n there's a lot of variables.\n\n07:03.320 --> 07:05.240\n So like first, when you think about leadership,\n\n07:05.240 --> 07:07.000\n have multiple people doing leadership\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:08.880\n and have them talk amongst each other.\n\n07:08.880 --> 07:11.320\n So giving each other feedback about the decisions\n\n07:11.320 --> 07:12.160\n that they're making.\n\n07:12.160 --> 07:13.640\n And then when you do get feedback,\n\n07:13.640 --> 07:16.240\n I think there's that little voice in your head, right?\n\n07:16.240 --> 07:19.040\n Or your gut or wherever you wanna put it in your body.\n\n07:19.040 --> 07:22.320\n I think that voice is really important.\n\n07:22.320 --> 07:25.120\n Like I think most people who have any kind of moral compass\n\n07:25.120 --> 07:25.960\n or like want to do,\n\n07:25.960 --> 07:27.280\n most people want to do the right thing.\n\n07:27.280 --> 07:28.360\n I do believe that.\n\n07:28.360 --> 07:30.640\n I mean, there might be a handful of sociopaths\n\n07:30.640 --> 07:32.520\n out there that don't, but most people,\n\n07:32.520 --> 07:34.640\n they want other people to think of them as a good person.\n\n07:34.640 --> 07:35.560\n And why wouldn't you, right?\n\n07:35.560 --> 07:36.800\n Like, do you want people to despise you?\n\n07:36.800 --> 07:38.040\n I mean, that's just weird, right?\n\n07:38.040 --> 07:39.160\n So you have that little voice\n\n07:39.160 --> 07:40.960\n that sort of the angel and devil on your shoulder\n\n07:40.960 --> 07:43.000\n sort of talking to you about like what you're doing,\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.520\n how you're doing, how does it make you feel\n\n07:44.520 --> 07:46.240\n to make these decisions, right?\n\n07:46.240 --> 07:49.200\n And I think having some attunement to that voice\n\n07:49.200 --> 07:50.160\n is important.\n\n07:50.160 --> 07:52.280\n But you said that voice also for,\n\n07:52.280 --> 07:55.080\n I think this is a programmer situation too,\n\n07:55.080 --> 07:57.080\n where sometimes the devil on the shoulder\n\n07:57.080 --> 07:59.680\n is a little too loud.\n\n07:59.680 --> 08:02.000\n So you're a little too self critical\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:03.320\n for a lot of developers,\n\n08:03.320 --> 08:05.520\n and especially when you have introverted personality.\n\n08:05.520 --> 08:07.520\n How do you struggle with a self criticism\n\n08:07.520 --> 08:09.720\n or the criticism of others?\n\n08:09.720 --> 08:11.720\n So one of the things of leadership\n\n08:11.720 --> 08:14.360\n is to do something that's potentially unpopular\n\n08:14.360 --> 08:15.720\n or where people doubt you\n\n08:15.720 --> 08:18.200\n and you still go through with the decision.\n\n08:18.200 --> 08:21.040\n So what's that balance like?\n\n08:21.040 --> 08:22.080\n I think you have to walk people\n\n08:22.080 --> 08:23.160\n through your decision making, right?\n\n08:23.160 --> 08:24.360\n Like you have to, this is where blogging\n\n08:24.360 --> 08:26.000\n is really important and communication is so important.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.800\n Again, code language is just another kind of code.\n\n08:27.800 --> 08:29.600\n It's like, here is the program\n\n08:29.600 --> 08:31.640\n by which I arrived at the conclusion\n\n08:31.640 --> 08:33.200\n that I'm gonna reach, right?\n\n08:33.200 --> 08:34.040\n It's one thing to say like,\n\n08:34.040 --> 08:36.680\n this is a decision, it's final, deal with it, right?\n\n08:36.680 --> 08:38.720\n That's not usually satisfying to people.\n\n08:38.720 --> 08:39.920\n But if you say, look,\n\n08:39.920 --> 08:41.240\n we've been thinking about this problem for a while.\n\n08:41.240 --> 08:42.480\n Here's some stuff that's happened.\n\n08:42.480 --> 08:43.880\n Here's what we think is right.\n\n08:43.880 --> 08:44.800\n Here's our goals.\n\n08:44.800 --> 08:45.840\n Here's what we wanna achieve.\n\n08:45.840 --> 08:47.760\n And we've looked at these options\n\n08:47.760 --> 08:50.440\n and we think this available options is the best option.\n\n08:50.440 --> 08:52.000\n People will be like, oh, okay, right?\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:52.960\n Maybe I don't totally agree with you,\n\n08:52.960 --> 08:54.240\n but I can kind of see where you're coming from\n\n08:54.240 --> 08:56.760\n and I see it's not just arbitrary decision\n\n08:56.760 --> 09:00.160\n delivered from a cloud of flames in the sky, right?\n\n09:00.160 --> 09:02.280\n It's like a human trying to reach\n\n09:02.280 --> 09:04.240\n some kind of consensus about goals.\n\n09:04.240 --> 09:05.640\n And their goals might be different than yours.\n\n09:05.640 --> 09:06.680\n That's completely legit, right?\n\n09:06.680 --> 09:08.760\n But if you're making that clear, it's like,\n\n09:08.760 --> 09:09.880\n oh, well, the reason we don't agree\n\n09:09.880 --> 09:11.600\n is because we have totally different goals, right?\n\n09:11.600 --> 09:12.840\n Like, how could we agree?\n\n09:12.840 --> 09:14.040\n It's not that you're a bad person.\n\n09:14.040 --> 09:16.640\n It's that we have radically different goals in mind\n\n09:16.640 --> 09:18.040\n when we started looking at this problem.\n\n09:18.040 --> 09:19.640\n And the other one you said is passion.\n\n09:19.640 --> 09:22.280\n So, or hard work, sorry.\n\n09:22.280 --> 09:24.040\n Well, those are tied together in my mind.\n\n09:24.040 --> 09:24.960\n Let's say hard work and passion.\n\n09:24.960 --> 09:26.680\n Like for me, like I just really love\n\n09:26.680 --> 09:28.280\n the problem discourse is setting out to solve\n\n09:28.280 --> 09:30.520\n because in a way it's like,\n\n09:30.520 --> 09:32.080\n there's a vision of the world\n\n09:32.080 --> 09:33.600\n where it all devolves into Facebook\n\n09:33.600 --> 09:35.920\n basically owning everything and every aspect\n\n09:35.920 --> 09:37.000\n of human communication, right?\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.880\n And this has always been kind of a scary world for me.\n\n09:39.880 --> 09:40.800\n First, cause I don't,\n\n09:40.800 --> 09:42.360\n I think Facebook is really good at execution.\n\n09:42.360 --> 09:43.200\n I got to compliment them.\n\n09:43.200 --> 09:45.360\n They're very competent in terms of what they're doing,\n\n09:45.360 --> 09:48.120\n but Facebook has not much of a moral compass\n\n09:48.120 --> 09:50.960\n in terms of Facebook cares about Facebook, really.\n\n09:50.960 --> 09:53.480\n They don't really care about you and your problems.\n\n09:53.480 --> 09:56.120\n What they care about is how big they can make Facebook,\n\n09:56.120 --> 09:56.960\n right?\n\n09:56.960 --> 09:57.800\n Is that you talking about the company\n\n09:57.800 --> 09:59.880\n or just the mechanism of how Facebook works?\n\n09:59.880 --> 10:01.000\n Kind of both really, right?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.680\n Like, and the idea with discourse,\n\n10:02.680 --> 10:03.840\n the reason I'm so passionate about it\n\n10:03.840 --> 10:05.320\n is cause I believe every community\n\n10:05.320 --> 10:07.000\n should have the right to own themselves, right?\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.560\n Like they should have their own software that they can run\n\n10:09.560 --> 10:10.960\n that belongs to them.\n\n10:10.960 --> 10:12.840\n That's their space where they can set the rules.\n\n10:12.840 --> 10:13.680\n And if they don't like it,\n\n10:13.680 --> 10:15.320\n they can move to different hosting or,\n\n10:15.320 --> 10:18.040\n you know, whatever they need to happen can happen.\n\n10:18.040 --> 10:20.560\n But like this idea of a company town\n\n10:20.560 --> 10:22.640\n where all human communication is implicitly owned\n\n10:22.640 --> 10:25.240\n by WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.\n\n10:25.240 --> 10:26.160\n And it's really disturbing too,\n\n10:26.160 --> 10:27.720\n cause Facebook is really smart.\n\n10:27.720 --> 10:28.880\n Like I said, they're great at execution.\n\n10:28.880 --> 10:30.600\n Buying in WhatsApp and buying Instagram\n\n10:30.600 --> 10:33.160\n were incredibly smart decisions.\n\n10:33.160 --> 10:34.720\n And they also do this thing, I don't know if you know,\n\n10:34.720 --> 10:36.240\n but they have this VPN software\n\n10:36.240 --> 10:38.760\n that they give away for free on smartphones\n\n10:38.760 --> 10:40.960\n and it indirectly feeds all the data\n\n10:40.960 --> 10:42.760\n about the traffic back to Facebook.\n\n10:42.760 --> 10:44.560\n So they can see what's actually getting popular\n\n10:44.560 --> 10:45.880\n through the VPNs, right?\n\n10:45.880 --> 10:48.320\n They have low level access to the network data\n\n10:48.320 --> 10:50.360\n because users have let them have that.\n\n10:50.360 --> 10:51.360\n So.\n\n10:51.360 --> 10:54.040\n So let's take a small pause here.\n\n10:54.040 --> 10:55.280\n First of all, discourse.\n\n10:55.280 --> 10:59.000\n Can you talk about, can you lay out the land\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.800\n of all the different ways you can have communities?\n\n11:01.800 --> 11:03.760\n So there's Stack Overflow that you've built.\n\n11:03.760 --> 11:05.200\n There's discourse.\n\n11:05.200 --> 11:07.200\n So Stack Overflow is kind of like a Wiki,\n\n11:07.200 --> 11:09.120\n Wikipedia you talk about.\n\n11:09.120 --> 11:11.880\n And it's a very specific scalpel, very focused.\n\n11:11.880 --> 11:13.440\n So what is the purpose of discourse\n\n11:13.440 --> 11:16.000\n and maybe contrast that with Facebook?\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.960\n First of all, say, what is discourse?\n\n11:17.960 --> 11:18.800\n Yeah.\n\n11:18.800 --> 11:19.640\n Start from the beginning.\n\n11:19.640 --> 11:20.480\n Well, let me start from the very beginning.\n\n11:20.480 --> 11:21.920\n So Stack Overflow is a very structured\n\n11:21.920 --> 11:24.600\n Wiki style Q and A for programmers, right?\n\n11:24.600 --> 11:26.680\n And that was the problem we first worked on.\n\n11:26.680 --> 11:28.840\n And when we started, we thought it was discussions\n\n11:28.840 --> 11:30.760\n because we looked at like programming forums\n\n11:30.760 --> 11:32.640\n and other things, but we quickly realized\n\n11:32.640 --> 11:35.400\n we were doing Q and A, which is a very narrow subset\n\n11:35.400 --> 11:36.880\n of human communication, right?\n\n11:36.880 --> 11:38.760\n Sorry, so when you started Stack Overflow,\n\n11:38.760 --> 11:41.760\n you thought you didn't even know the Q and A.\n\n11:41.760 --> 11:42.600\n Not really.\n\n11:42.600 --> 11:43.440\n You didn't know it would be Q and A.\n\n11:43.440 --> 11:44.280\n Well, we didn't know.\n\n11:44.280 --> 11:45.720\n We had an idea of like, okay, these are things\n\n11:45.720 --> 11:46.840\n that we see working online.\n\n11:46.840 --> 11:47.680\n We had a goal, right?\n\n11:47.680 --> 11:50.960\n Our goal was there was this site, Experts Exchange,\n\n11:50.960 --> 11:52.560\n with a very unfortunate name.\n\n11:52.560 --> 11:53.800\n Thank you for killing that site.\n\n11:53.800 --> 11:54.680\n Yeah, I know, right?\n\n11:54.680 --> 11:56.400\n Like a lot of people don't remember it anymore,\n\n11:56.400 --> 11:57.240\n which is great.\n\n11:57.240 --> 11:58.080\n Like that's the measure of success\n\n11:58.080 --> 11:59.280\n when people don't remember the thing\n\n11:59.280 --> 12:02.600\n that you were trying to replace, then you've totally won.\n\n12:02.600 --> 12:05.600\n So it was a place to get answers to programming questions,\n\n12:05.600 --> 12:07.440\n but it wasn't clear if it was like focused Q and A,\n\n12:07.440 --> 12:08.760\n if it was a discussion.\n\n12:08.760 --> 12:10.320\n There were plenty of programming forums.\n\n12:10.320 --> 12:11.320\n So we weren't really sure.\n\n12:11.320 --> 12:13.440\n We were like, okay, we'll take aspects of dig and Reddit,\n\n12:13.440 --> 12:15.720\n like voting were very important.\n\n12:15.720 --> 12:17.400\n Reordering answers based on votes.\n\n12:17.400 --> 12:19.560\n Wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts,\n\n12:19.560 --> 12:21.240\n not just your posts, but other people's posts\n\n12:21.240 --> 12:23.840\n to make them better and keep them more up to date.\n\n12:23.840 --> 12:26.160\n Ownership of blogging of like, okay, this is me.\n\n12:26.160 --> 12:29.800\n I'm saying this in my voice, this is the stuff that I know.\n\n12:29.800 --> 12:33.360\n And your reputation accrues to you\n\n12:33.360 --> 12:34.880\n and it's peer recognition.\n\n12:34.880 --> 12:37.040\n So you asked earlier, like what motivates programmers?\n\n12:37.040 --> 12:40.040\n I think peer recognition motivates them a lot.\n\n12:40.040 --> 12:41.840\n That was one of the key insights of Stack Overflow\n\n12:41.840 --> 12:44.960\n was like recognition from your peers is why things get done.\n\n12:44.960 --> 12:46.400\n Not necessarily money, not necessarily your boss,\n\n12:46.400 --> 12:47.840\n but like your peers saying, wow,\n\n12:47.840 --> 12:50.360\n this person really knows their stuff, has a lot of value.\n\n12:50.360 --> 12:53.280\n So the reputation system came from that.\n\n12:53.280 --> 12:56.320\n So we were sort of Frankensteining a bunch of stuff together\n\n12:56.320 --> 12:58.680\n in Stack Overflow, like stuff we had seen working\n\n12:58.680 --> 13:03.680\n and we knew worked and that became Stack Overflow.\n\n13:04.400 --> 13:06.520\n Over time, we realized it wasn't really discussion.\n\n13:06.520 --> 13:08.760\n It was very focused questions and answers.\n\n13:08.760 --> 13:10.040\n There wasn't a lot of room on the page\n\n13:10.040 --> 13:12.520\n for let me talk about this tangential thing.\n\n13:12.520 --> 13:14.760\n It was more like, okay, is it answering the question?\n\n13:14.760 --> 13:16.160\n Is it clarifying the question?\n\n13:16.160 --> 13:18.720\n Or could it be an alternative answer to the same question?\n\n13:18.720 --> 13:20.560\n Because there's usually more than one way to do it\n\n13:20.560 --> 13:22.640\n in programming, there's like say five to 10 ways.\n\n13:22.640 --> 13:24.400\n And one of the patterns we got into early on\n\n13:24.400 --> 13:26.440\n with Stack Overflow was there were questions\n\n13:26.440 --> 13:28.440\n where there would be like hundreds of answers.\n\n13:28.440 --> 13:31.800\n And we're like, wow, how can there be a programming question\n\n13:31.800 --> 13:34.720\n with 500, 200, 500 answers?\n\n13:34.720 --> 13:36.160\n And we looked at those and we realized\n\n13:36.160 --> 13:38.840\n those were not really questions in the traditional sense.\n\n13:38.840 --> 13:39.800\n They were discussions.\n\n13:39.800 --> 13:42.280\n It was stuff that we allowed early on\n\n13:42.280 --> 13:44.640\n that we eventually decided wasn't allowed such as\n\n13:44.640 --> 13:46.760\n what's your favorite programming food?\n\n13:46.760 --> 13:49.560\n What's the funniest programming cartoon you've seen?\n\n13:49.560 --> 13:51.320\n And we had to sort of backfill a bunch of rules\n\n13:51.320 --> 13:53.080\n about like, why isn't this allowed?\n\n13:53.080 --> 13:55.160\n Such as, is this a real problem you're facing?\n\n13:55.160 --> 13:57.200\n Like nobody goes to work and says, wow, I can't work\n\n13:57.200 --> 13:59.080\n cause I don't know what the funniest programming cartoon is.\n\n13:59.080 --> 14:02.040\n So sorry, can't compile this code now, right?\n\n14:02.040 --> 14:04.600\n It's not a real problem you're facing in your job.\n\n14:04.600 --> 14:05.440\n So that was run rule.\n\n14:05.440 --> 14:07.320\n And the second, like, what can you really learn from that?\n\n14:07.320 --> 14:08.760\n It's like what I call accidental learning\n\n14:08.760 --> 14:10.200\n or Reddit style learning.\n\n14:10.200 --> 14:11.640\n Where you're just like, oh, I'll just browse some things\n\n14:11.640 --> 14:13.360\n and oh, wow, you know, did you know\n\n14:13.360 --> 14:14.960\n tree frogs only live three years?\n\n14:14.960 --> 14:16.000\n I mean, I just made that up.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:16.920\n I don't know if that's true.\n\n14:16.920 --> 14:18.920\n But I didn't really set out to learn that.\n\n14:18.920 --> 14:20.280\n I don't need to know that, right?\n\n14:20.280 --> 14:21.760\n It's accidental learning.\n\n14:21.760 --> 14:23.840\n It was more intentional learning where you're like,\n\n14:23.840 --> 14:24.660\n okay, I have a problem.\n\n14:24.660 --> 14:25.500\n And I want to learn about stuff\n\n14:25.500 --> 14:27.160\n around this problem having, right?\n\n14:27.160 --> 14:29.160\n And it could be theory, it could be compiler theory,\n\n14:29.160 --> 14:31.840\n it could be other stuff, but I'm having a compiler problem.\n\n14:31.840 --> 14:34.320\n Hence, I need to know the compiler theory,\n\n14:34.320 --> 14:38.160\n that aspect of it that gets me to my answer, right?\n\n14:38.160 --> 14:39.400\n So kind of a directed learning.\n\n14:39.400 --> 14:40.960\n So we had to backfill all these rules\n\n14:40.960 --> 14:43.680\n as we sort of figured out what the heck it was we were doing.\n\n14:43.680 --> 14:45.420\n And the system came very strict over time.\n\n14:45.420 --> 14:46.880\n And a lot of people still complain about that.\n\n14:46.880 --> 14:49.040\n And I wrote my latest blog entry,\n\n14:49.040 --> 14:52.360\n what does Stack Overflow want to be when it grows up?\n\n14:52.360 --> 14:54.200\n Celebrating the 10 year anniversary, yeah.\n\n14:54.200 --> 14:55.240\n Yeah, so 10 years.\n\n14:55.240 --> 14:57.680\n And the system has trended towards strictness.\n\n14:57.680 --> 14:58.900\n There's a variety of reasons for this.\n\n14:58.900 --> 15:01.320\n One is people don't like to see other people\n\n15:01.320 --> 15:03.960\n get reputation for stuff as they view as frivolous,\n\n15:03.960 --> 15:05.080\n which I can actually understand.\n\n15:05.080 --> 15:07.880\n Because if you saw a programmer got like 500 upvotes\n\n15:07.880 --> 15:10.360\n for funniest programming cartoon\n\n15:10.360 --> 15:11.800\n or funniest comment they had seen in code,\n\n15:11.800 --> 15:13.820\n it's like, well, why do they have that reputation?\n\n15:13.820 --> 15:15.040\n Is it because they wrote the joke?\n\n15:15.040 --> 15:15.880\n Probably not.\n\n15:15.880 --> 15:18.240\n I mean, if they did, maybe, or the cartoon, right?\n\n15:18.240 --> 15:19.440\n They're getting a bunch of reputation\n\n15:19.440 --> 15:22.640\n based on someone else's work that's not even programming.\n\n15:22.640 --> 15:23.600\n It's just a joke, right?\n\n15:23.600 --> 15:24.800\n It's related to programming.\n\n15:24.800 --> 15:26.440\n So you begin to resent that.\n\n15:26.440 --> 15:27.520\n You're like, well, that's not fair.\n\n15:27.520 --> 15:28.000\n And it isn't.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:29.080\n At some level, they're correct.\n\n15:29.080 --> 15:30.000\n I mean, I empathize.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.200\n Because it's not correct to get reputation for that.\n\n15:32.200 --> 15:36.040\n Versus here's a really gnarly regular expression problem.\n\n15:36.040 --> 15:40.040\n And here's a really clever, insightful, detailed answer\n\n15:40.040 --> 15:41.640\n laying out, oh, here's why you're\n\n15:41.640 --> 15:42.560\n seeing the behavior that you're seeing.\n\n15:42.560 --> 15:43.880\n Here, let me teach you some things about how\n\n15:43.880 --> 15:44.920\n to avoid that in the future.\n\n15:44.920 --> 15:45.680\n That's great.\n\n15:45.680 --> 15:46.560\n That's gold, right?\n\n15:46.560 --> 15:47.920\n You want people to get reputation for that,\n\n15:47.920 --> 15:50.960\n not so much for, wow, look at this funny thing I saw, right?\n\n15:50.960 --> 15:51.480\n Great.\n\n15:51.480 --> 15:54.320\n So there's this very specific Q&A format.\n\n15:54.320 --> 15:57.440\n And then take me through the journey towards discourse\n\n15:57.440 --> 15:58.600\n and Facebook and Twitter.\n\n15:58.600 --> 16:01.440\n So you started at the beginning that Stack Overflow\n\n16:01.440 --> 16:02.960\n evolved to have a purpose.\n\n16:02.960 --> 16:06.320\n So what is discourse, this passion\n\n16:06.320 --> 16:10.800\n you have for creating community for discussion?\n\n16:10.800 --> 16:12.160\n When was that born and how?\n\n16:12.160 --> 16:13.560\n Well, part of it is based on the realization\n\n16:13.560 --> 16:16.560\n that Stack Overflow is only good for very specific subjects\n\n16:16.560 --> 16:19.680\n where it's based on data, facts, and science,\n\n16:19.680 --> 16:22.480\n where answers can be kind of verified to be true.\n\n16:22.480 --> 16:24.840\n Another form of that is there's the book of knowledge,\n\n16:24.840 --> 16:28.440\n like the tome of knowledge that defines whatever it is.\n\n16:28.440 --> 16:30.840\n You can refer to that book and it'll give you the answer.\n\n16:30.840 --> 16:33.080\n There has to be, it only works on subjects\n\n16:33.080 --> 16:35.320\n where there's like semi clear answers to things\n\n16:35.320 --> 16:37.520\n that can be verified in some form.\n\n16:37.520 --> 16:39.760\n Now again, there's always more than one way to do it.\n\n16:39.760 --> 16:41.880\n There's complete flexibility and system around that.\n\n16:41.880 --> 16:45.280\n But where it falls down is stuff like poker and LEGO.\n\n16:45.280 --> 16:48.720\n Like we had, if you go to stackexchange.com,\n\n16:48.720 --> 16:50.400\n we have an engine that tries to launch\n\n16:50.400 --> 16:52.280\n different Q&A topics, right?\n\n16:52.280 --> 16:56.960\n And people can propose Q&A topics, sample questions,\n\n16:56.960 --> 16:59.040\n and if it gets enough support within the network,\n\n16:59.040 --> 17:00.080\n we launched that Q&A site.\n\n17:00.080 --> 17:02.280\n So some of the ones we launched were poker and LEGO\n\n17:02.280 --> 17:03.360\n and they did horribly, right?\n\n17:03.360 --> 17:06.200\n Because I mean, they might still be there lingering on\n\n17:06.200 --> 17:07.800\n in some form, but it was an experiment.\n\n17:07.800 --> 17:09.000\n This is like a test, right?\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.680\n And some subjects work super well on the stack engine\n\n17:11.680 --> 17:12.720\n and some don't.\n\n17:12.720 --> 17:14.600\n But the reason LEGO and poker don't work\n\n17:14.600 --> 17:16.040\n is because they're so social, really.\n\n17:16.040 --> 17:19.080\n It's not about what's the rule here in poker.\n\n17:19.080 --> 17:21.440\n It's like, well, what kind of cigars\n\n17:21.440 --> 17:23.480\n do we like to smoke while playing poker?\n\n17:23.480 --> 17:26.920\n Or what's a cool set of cards to use when I'm playing poker?\n\n17:26.920 --> 17:28.680\n Or what's some strategies?\n\n17:28.680 --> 17:30.760\n Say I have this hand come up with some strategies\n\n17:30.760 --> 17:31.200\n I could use.\n\n17:31.200 --> 17:34.200\n It's more of a discussion around what's happening with LEGO.\n\n17:34.200 --> 17:36.000\n Same thing, here's this cool LEGO set I found.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:36.880\n Look how awesome this is.\n\n17:36.880 --> 17:38.520\n And I'm like, yeah, that's freaking awesome, right?\n\n17:38.520 --> 17:39.880\n It's not a question, right?\n\n17:39.880 --> 17:41.960\n There's all these social components and discussions\n\n17:41.960 --> 17:43.200\n that don't fit at all.\n\n17:43.200 --> 17:45.280\n We literally have to disallow those in Stack Overflow\n\n17:45.280 --> 17:46.780\n because it's not about being social.\n\n17:46.780 --> 17:49.360\n It's about problems that you're facing in your work\n\n17:49.360 --> 17:51.000\n that you need concrete answers for.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.880\n You have a real demonstrated problem that's\n\n17:52.880 --> 17:54.040\n blocking you in something.\n\n17:54.040 --> 17:56.200\n Nobody's blocked by, what should I\n\n17:56.200 --> 17:58.200\n do when I have a straight flush?\n\n17:58.200 --> 18:00.400\n It's not a blocking problem in the world.\n\n18:00.400 --> 18:02.320\n It's just an opportunity to hang out and discuss.\n\n18:02.320 --> 18:07.680\n So discourse was a way to address that and say, look,\n\n18:07.680 --> 18:10.680\n discussion forum software was very, very bad.\n\n18:10.680 --> 18:18.400\n And when I came out of Stack Overflow in early 2012,\n\n18:18.400 --> 18:19.800\n it was still very, very bad.\n\n18:19.800 --> 18:22.800\n I expected it improved in the four years since I last looked,\n\n18:22.800 --> 18:24.160\n but it had not improved at all.\n\n18:24.160 --> 18:26.000\n And I was like, well, that's kind of terrible\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.880\n because I love these communities of people talking about things\n\n18:29.880 --> 18:31.120\n that they love.\n\n18:31.120 --> 18:32.920\n They're just communities of interest, right?\n\n18:32.920 --> 18:35.320\n And there's no good software for them.\n\n18:35.320 --> 18:37.360\n Startups would come to me and say, hey, Jeff,\n\n18:37.360 --> 18:39.720\n I want to have this startup.\n\n18:39.720 --> 18:40.880\n Here's my idea.\n\n18:40.880 --> 18:42.460\n And the first thing I would say to them\n\n18:42.460 --> 18:44.160\n is, well, first, why are you asking me?\n\n18:44.160 --> 18:47.440\n I don't really know your field necessarily.\n\n18:47.440 --> 18:49.120\n Why aren't you asking the community,\n\n18:49.120 --> 18:51.240\n the people that are interested in this problem,\n\n18:51.240 --> 18:52.440\n the people that are using your product,\n\n18:52.440 --> 18:53.960\n why aren't you talking to them?\n\n18:53.960 --> 18:55.320\n And then they'd say, oh, great idea.\n\n18:55.320 --> 18:56.080\n How do I do that?\n\n18:56.080 --> 18:58.080\n And then that's when I started playing sad trombone\n\n18:58.080 --> 19:00.040\n because I realized all the software involving\n\n19:00.040 --> 19:03.240\n talking to your users, customers, audience, patrons,\n\n19:03.240 --> 19:04.880\n whatever it is, it was all really bad.\n\n19:04.880 --> 19:06.640\n It was stuff that I would be embarrassed\n\n19:06.640 --> 19:08.320\n to recommend to other people.\n\n19:08.320 --> 19:10.800\n And yet, that's where I felt they could get the biggest\n\n19:10.800 --> 19:12.760\n and strongest, most effective input\n\n19:12.760 --> 19:15.560\n for what they should be doing with their product, right?\n\n19:15.560 --> 19:17.480\n It's from their users, from their community, right?\n\n19:17.480 --> 19:18.840\n That's what we did on Stack Overflow.\n\n19:18.840 --> 19:21.320\n So what we're talking about with forums,\n\n19:21.320 --> 19:25.440\n the, what is it, the dark matter of the internet,\n\n19:25.440 --> 19:26.800\n it's still, I don't know if it's still,\n\n19:26.800 --> 19:28.720\n but for the longest time,\n\n19:28.720 --> 19:31.480\n it has some of the most passionate\n\n19:31.480 --> 19:32.760\n and fascinating discussions.\n\n19:32.760 --> 19:34.600\n And what's the usual structure?\n\n19:34.600 --> 19:38.160\n There's usually, it's linear, so it's sequential.\n\n19:38.160 --> 19:39.600\n So you're posting one after the other\n\n19:39.600 --> 19:42.760\n and there's pagination, so it's every,\n\n19:42.760 --> 19:45.000\n there's 10 posts and then you go to the next page.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.040\n And that format still is used by,\n\n19:48.040 --> 19:50.040\n like I'm, we're doing a lot of research\n\n19:50.040 --> 19:53.560\n with Tesla vehicles and there's a Tesla Motors Club forum,\n\n19:53.560 --> 19:54.400\n which is extremely.\n\n19:54.400 --> 19:56.240\n We really wanted to run that actually.\n\n19:56.240 --> 19:57.680\n They pinged us about it, I don't think we got it,\n\n19:57.680 --> 19:59.200\n but I really would have liked to gotten that one.\n\n19:59.200 --> 20:02.560\n But they've started before even 2012, I believe.\n\n20:02.560 --> 20:04.160\n I mean, they've been running for a long time.\n\n20:04.160 --> 20:06.800\n It's still an extremely rich source of information.\n\n20:06.800 --> 20:09.680\n So what's broken about that system\n\n20:09.680 --> 20:12.120\n and how are you trying to fix it?\n\n20:12.120 --> 20:15.840\n I think there's a lot of power in connecting people\n\n20:15.840 --> 20:19.120\n that love the same stuff around that specific topic.\n\n20:19.120 --> 20:22.120\n Meaning Facebook's idea of connection is\n\n20:22.120 --> 20:24.520\n just any human that's related to another human, right?\n\n20:24.520 --> 20:27.440\n Like through friendship or any other reason.\n\n20:27.440 --> 20:28.720\n Facebook's idea of the world\n\n20:28.720 --> 20:30.400\n is sort of the status update, right?\n\n20:30.400 --> 20:32.440\n Like a friend of yours did something,\n\n20:32.440 --> 20:34.960\n ate at a restaurant, right?\n\n20:34.960 --> 20:37.200\n Whereas discussion forums were traditionally\n\n20:37.200 --> 20:38.240\n around the interest graph.\n\n20:38.240 --> 20:40.280\n Like I love electric cars,\n\n20:40.280 --> 20:41.920\n specifically I love Tesla, right?\n\n20:41.920 --> 20:44.240\n Like I love the way they approach the problem.\n\n20:44.240 --> 20:45.840\n I love the style of the founder.\n\n20:45.840 --> 20:48.120\n I just love the design ethic.\n\n20:48.120 --> 20:49.200\n And there's a lot to like about Tesla.\n\n20:49.200 --> 20:50.160\n I don't know if you saw the oatmeal,\n\n20:50.160 --> 20:53.040\n he did a whole love comic to Tesla.\n\n20:53.040 --> 20:53.880\n And it was actually kind of cool\n\n20:53.880 --> 20:54.720\n because I learned some stuff.\n\n20:54.720 --> 20:56.960\n He was talking about how great Tesla cars were specifically,\n\n20:56.960 --> 20:58.280\n like how they were built differently.\n\n20:58.280 --> 20:59.800\n And he went into a lot of great detail\n\n20:59.800 --> 21:00.640\n that was really interesting.\n\n21:00.640 --> 21:02.600\n And to me, that oatmeal post, if you read it,\n\n21:02.600 --> 21:05.720\n is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities.\n\n21:05.720 --> 21:06.960\n I just really love this stuff.\n\n21:06.960 --> 21:08.400\n So like for me, for example, there's yo yos, right?\n\n21:08.400 --> 21:09.680\n Like I'm into the yo yo communities.\n\n21:09.680 --> 21:11.720\n And these interest communities\n\n21:11.720 --> 21:12.920\n are just really fascinating to me.\n\n21:12.920 --> 21:15.200\n And I feel more connected to the yo yo communities\n\n21:15.200 --> 21:18.600\n than I do to friends that I don't see that often, right?\n\n21:18.600 --> 21:21.720\n Like to me, the powerful thing is the interest graph.\n\n21:21.720 --> 21:25.000\n And Facebook kind of dabbles in the interest graph.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:25.920\n I mean, they have groups,\n\n21:25.920 --> 21:26.960\n you can sign up for groups and stuff,\n\n21:26.960 --> 21:29.440\n but it's really about the relationship graph.\n\n21:29.440 --> 21:32.080\n Like this is my coworker, this is my relative,\n\n21:32.080 --> 21:35.280\n this is my friend, but not so much about the interest.\n\n21:35.280 --> 21:36.920\n So I think that's the linchpin\n\n21:36.920 --> 21:39.200\n of which forums and communities are built on\n\n21:39.200 --> 21:40.320\n that I personally love.\n\n21:40.320 --> 21:44.240\n Like I said, leadership is about passion, right?\n\n21:44.240 --> 21:45.520\n And being passionate about stuff\n\n21:45.520 --> 21:47.520\n is a really valid way to look at the world.\n\n21:47.520 --> 21:50.560\n And I think it's a way a lot of stuff in the world\n\n21:50.560 --> 21:51.400\n gets done.\n\n21:51.400 --> 21:52.880\n Like I once had someone describe me as,\n\n21:52.880 --> 21:54.640\n he's like, Jeff, you're a guy who,\n\n21:54.640 --> 21:57.560\n you just get super passionate about a few things at a time,\n\n21:57.560 --> 21:59.760\n and you just go super deep in those things.\n\n21:59.760 --> 22:00.720\n And I was like, oh, that's kind of right.\n\n22:00.720 --> 22:01.560\n That's kind of what I do.\n\n22:01.560 --> 22:03.400\n I get into something and just be super into that\n\n22:03.400 --> 22:04.560\n for a couple of years or whatever,\n\n22:04.560 --> 22:05.960\n and just learn all I can about it,\n\n22:05.960 --> 22:07.800\n and go super deep in it.\n\n22:07.800 --> 22:11.000\n And that's how I enjoy experiencing the world, right?\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.400\n Like not being shallow on a bunch of things,\n\n22:12.400 --> 22:14.320\n but being really deep on a few things\n\n22:14.320 --> 22:15.360\n that I'm interested in.\n\n22:15.360 --> 22:17.200\n So forums kind of unlock that, right?\n\n22:17.200 --> 22:18.920\n And you don't want a world\n\n22:18.920 --> 22:20.920\n where everything belongs to Facebook, at least I don't.\n\n22:20.920 --> 22:22.760\n I want a world where communities can kind of own themselves,\n\n22:22.760 --> 22:25.120\n set their own norms, set their own rules,\n\n22:25.120 --> 22:26.320\n control the experience.\n\n22:26.320 --> 22:28.720\n Because community is also about ownership, right?\n\n22:28.720 --> 22:32.160\n Like if you're meeting at the Barnes and Noble every Thursday\n\n22:32.160 --> 22:33.440\n and Barnes and Noble says, get out of here,\n\n22:33.440 --> 22:34.600\n you guys don't buy enough books.\n\n22:34.600 --> 22:36.640\n Well, you know, you're kind of hosed, right?\n\n22:36.640 --> 22:37.880\n Barnes and Noble owns you, right?\n\n22:37.880 --> 22:38.880\n Like you can't.\n\n22:38.880 --> 22:40.320\n But if you have your own meeting space,\n\n22:40.320 --> 22:41.440\n you know, your own clubhouse,\n\n22:41.440 --> 22:43.040\n you can set your own rules,\n\n22:43.040 --> 22:44.560\n decide what you want to talk about there,\n\n22:44.560 --> 22:47.800\n and just really generate a lot better information\n\n22:47.800 --> 22:49.520\n than you could like hanging out at Barnes and Noble\n\n22:49.520 --> 22:51.920\n every Thursday at 3 p.m., right?\n\n22:51.920 --> 22:53.840\n So that's kind of the vision of Discourse,\n\n22:53.840 --> 22:57.160\n is a place where it's fully open source.\n\n22:57.160 --> 22:59.160\n You can take the software, you can install it anywhere,\n\n22:59.160 --> 23:00.920\n and, you know, you and a group of people\n\n23:00.920 --> 23:02.880\n can go deep on whatever it is that you're into.\n\n23:02.880 --> 23:04.440\n And this works for startups, right?\n\n23:04.440 --> 23:05.960\n Startups are a group of people\n\n23:05.960 --> 23:08.440\n who go super deep on a specific problem, right?\n\n23:08.440 --> 23:09.600\n And they want to talk to the community.\n\n23:09.600 --> 23:11.040\n It's like, well, install Discourse, right?\n\n23:11.040 --> 23:12.040\n That's what we do at Discourse.\n\n23:12.040 --> 23:13.560\n That's what I did at Stack Overflow.\n\n23:13.560 --> 23:15.520\n I spent a lot of time on Meta Stack Overflow,\n\n23:15.520 --> 23:20.200\n which is our internal, well, public community feedback site,\n\n23:20.200 --> 23:24.000\n and just experiencing what the users were experiencing,\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:24.840\n right, because they're the ones\n\n23:24.840 --> 23:26.080\n doing all the work in the system.\n\n23:26.080 --> 23:27.600\n And they had a lot of interesting feedback.\n\n23:27.600 --> 23:29.240\n And there's that 90, 10 rule of, like,\n\n23:29.240 --> 23:31.640\n 90% of the feedback you get is not really actionable\n\n23:31.640 --> 23:32.480\n for a variety of reasons.\n\n23:32.480 --> 23:34.640\n It might be bad feedback, it might be crazy feedback,\n\n23:34.640 --> 23:36.400\n it might be feedback you just can't act on right now.\n\n23:36.400 --> 23:38.320\n But there's 10% of it that's like gold.\n\n23:38.320 --> 23:39.760\n It's like literally gold and diamonds,\n\n23:39.760 --> 23:42.440\n where it's like feedback of really good improvements\n\n23:42.440 --> 23:44.800\n to your core product that are not super hard to get to\n\n23:44.800 --> 23:45.800\n and actually make a lot of sense.\n\n23:45.800 --> 23:47.800\n And my favorite is about 5% of those stuff\n\n23:47.800 --> 23:48.680\n I didn't even see coming.\n\n23:48.680 --> 23:50.480\n It's like, oh my God, I never even thought of that.\n\n23:50.480 --> 23:52.560\n But that's a brilliant idea, right?\n\n23:52.560 --> 23:54.560\n And I can point to so many features of Stack Overflow\n\n23:54.560 --> 23:56.680\n that we derive from Meta Stack Overflow feedback\n\n23:56.680 --> 23:58.000\n and Meta discourse, right?\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.220\n Same exact principle of discourse, you know?\n\n24:01.220 --> 24:02.060\n We're getting ideas from the community.\n\n24:02.060 --> 24:03.440\n I was like, oh my God, I never thought of that,\n\n24:03.440 --> 24:04.640\n but that's fantastic, right?\n\n24:04.640 --> 24:06.920\n Like, I love that relationship with the community.\n\n24:06.920 --> 24:08.680\n From having built these communities,\n\n24:08.680 --> 24:11.080\n what have you learned about?\n\n24:11.080 --> 24:13.320\n What's the process of getting a critical mass of members\n\n24:13.320 --> 24:14.160\n in a community?\n\n24:14.160 --> 24:17.000\n Is it luck, skill, timing, persistence?\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:20.340\n What is, is it the tools, like discourse,\n\n24:20.340 --> 24:21.840\n that empower that community?\n\n24:21.840 --> 24:25.840\n What's the key aspect of starting for one guy or gal\n\n24:25.840 --> 24:27.720\n and then building it to two and then 10\n\n24:27.720 --> 24:29.960\n and a hundred and a thousand and so on?\n\n24:29.960 --> 24:32.280\n I think when you're starting with an N of one,\n\n24:32.280 --> 24:33.880\n I mean, I think it's persistence\n\n24:33.880 --> 24:37.000\n and also you have to be interesting.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.040\n Like somebody I really admire once said something\n\n24:39.040 --> 24:40.160\n that I always liked about blogging.\n\n24:40.160 --> 24:41.800\n He's like, here's how you blog.\n\n24:41.800 --> 24:44.400\n You have to have something interesting to say\n\n24:44.400 --> 24:46.920\n and have an interesting way of saying it, right?\n\n24:46.920 --> 24:48.960\n And then do that for like 10 years.\n\n24:49.880 --> 24:50.920\n So that's the genesis,\n\n24:50.920 --> 24:53.280\n is like you have to have sort of something interesting\n\n24:53.280 --> 24:55.260\n to say that's not exactly what everybody else is saying\n\n24:55.260 --> 24:56.360\n and an interesting way of saying it,\n\n24:56.360 --> 24:57.260\n which is another way of saying,\n\n24:57.260 --> 24:59.240\n kind of entertaining way of saying it.\n\n24:59.240 --> 25:01.920\n And then as far as growing it, it's like ritual.\n\n25:01.920 --> 25:04.240\n You know, like you have to, like say you're starting a blog,\n\n25:04.240 --> 25:06.680\n you have to say, look, I'm gonna blog every week,\n\n25:06.680 --> 25:07.960\n three times a week,\n\n25:07.960 --> 25:09.940\n and you have to stick to that schedule, right?\n\n25:09.940 --> 25:12.840\n Because until you do that for like several years,\n\n25:12.840 --> 25:14.360\n you're never gonna get anywhere.\n\n25:14.360 --> 25:16.680\n Like it just takes years to get to where you need to get to.\n\n25:16.680 --> 25:18.680\n And part of that is having the discipline\n\n25:18.680 --> 25:19.720\n to stick with the schedule.\n\n25:19.720 --> 25:21.440\n And it helps, again, if it's something you're passionate\n\n25:21.440 --> 25:22.720\n about, this won't feel like work.\n\n25:22.720 --> 25:23.560\n You're like, I love this.\n\n25:23.560 --> 25:25.640\n I could talk about this all day, every day, right?\n\n25:26.840 --> 25:27.680\n You just have to do it in a way\n\n25:27.680 --> 25:28.640\n that's interesting to other people.\n\n25:28.640 --> 25:30.640\n And then as you're growing the community,\n\n25:30.640 --> 25:32.480\n that pattern of participation within the community\n\n25:32.480 --> 25:34.320\n of like generating these artifacts\n\n25:34.320 --> 25:35.720\n and inviting other people to help you\n\n25:35.720 --> 25:36.960\n like collaborate on these artifacts,\n\n25:36.960 --> 25:38.280\n like even in the case of blogging,\n\n25:38.280 --> 25:40.880\n like I felt in the early days of my blog,\n\n25:40.880 --> 25:41.960\n which I started in 2004,\n\n25:41.960 --> 25:43.760\n which is really the genesis of Stack Overflow.\n\n25:43.760 --> 25:46.280\n If you look at all my blog, it leads up to Stack Overflow,\n\n25:46.280 --> 25:48.440\n which was, I have all this energy in my blog,\n\n25:48.440 --> 25:51.320\n but I don't, like 40,000 people were subscribing to me.\n\n25:51.320 --> 25:52.440\n And I was like, I wanna do something.\n\n25:52.440 --> 25:54.160\n And then I met Joel and said, hey, Joel,\n\n25:54.160 --> 25:55.320\n I wanna do something,\n\n25:55.320 --> 25:57.360\n take this ball of energy from my blog and do something.\n\n25:57.360 --> 25:58.800\n And all the people reading my blog saw that.\n\n25:58.800 --> 25:59.800\n It's like, oh, cool.\n\n25:59.800 --> 26:00.640\n You're involving us.\n\n26:00.640 --> 26:03.360\n You're saying, look, you're part of this community.\n\n26:03.360 --> 26:04.560\n Let's build this thing together.\n\n26:04.560 --> 26:05.520\n Like they pick the name.\n\n26:05.520 --> 26:08.040\n Like we voted on the name for Stack Overflow on my blog.\n\n26:08.040 --> 26:09.960\n Like we came up, and naming is super hard.\n\n26:09.960 --> 26:12.240\n First of all, the hardest problem in computer science\n\n26:12.240 --> 26:14.520\n is coming up with a good name for stuff, right?\n\n26:14.520 --> 26:15.880\n But you can go back to my blog.\n\n26:15.880 --> 26:17.640\n There's the poll where we voted\n\n26:17.640 --> 26:19.240\n and Stack Overflow became the name of the site.\n\n26:19.240 --> 26:21.160\n And all the early beta users of Stack Overflow\n\n26:21.160 --> 26:24.600\n were audience of my blog plus Joel's blog, right?\n\n26:24.600 --> 26:26.520\n So we started from, like, if you look at the genesis,\n\n26:26.520 --> 26:28.160\n okay, I was just a programmer who said,\n\n26:28.160 --> 26:29.680\n hey, I love programming,\n\n26:29.680 --> 26:31.000\n but I have no outlet to talk about it.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:31.920\n So I'm just gonna blog about it,\n\n26:31.920 --> 26:33.320\n because I don't have enough people to work\n\n26:33.320 --> 26:34.360\n to talk to about it.\n\n26:34.360 --> 26:36.440\n Because at the time I worked a place where,\n\n26:36.440 --> 26:37.960\n you know, programming wasn't the core output\n\n26:37.960 --> 26:40.840\n of the company, it was a pharmaceutical company.\n\n26:40.840 --> 26:43.560\n And I just love this stuff, you know, to an absurd degree.\n\n26:43.560 --> 26:44.960\n So I was like, I'll just blog about it.\n\n26:44.960 --> 26:45.960\n And then I'll find an audience\n\n26:45.960 --> 26:47.720\n and eventually found an audience,\n\n26:47.720 --> 26:49.000\n eventually found Joel,\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.480\n and eventually built Stack Overflow\n\n26:50.480 --> 26:52.880\n from that one core of activity, right?\n\n26:52.880 --> 26:55.880\n But it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback\n\n26:55.880 --> 26:58.080\n from my blog comments, feedback from Joel,\n\n26:58.080 --> 27:01.480\n feedback from the early Stack Overflow community.\n\n27:01.480 --> 27:02.880\n When people see that you're doing that,\n\n27:02.880 --> 27:04.160\n they will follow along with you, right?\n\n27:04.160 --> 27:05.520\n They'll say, cool, you're here in good faith.\n\n27:05.520 --> 27:07.280\n You're actually, you know, not listening to everything\n\n27:07.280 --> 27:09.320\n because that's impossible, that's impossible.\n\n27:09.320 --> 27:11.720\n But you're actually, you know,\n\n27:11.720 --> 27:14.120\n waiting our feedback and what you're doing.\n\n27:14.120 --> 27:14.960\n And why wouldn't I?\n\n27:14.960 --> 27:16.720\n Because who does all the work on Stack Overflow?\n\n27:16.720 --> 27:17.960\n Me, Joel?\n\n27:17.960 --> 27:19.680\n No, it's the other programmers\n\n27:19.680 --> 27:20.560\n that are doing all the work.\n\n27:20.560 --> 27:22.400\n So you gotta have some respect for that.\n\n27:22.400 --> 27:24.920\n And then, you know, discipline around,\n\n27:24.920 --> 27:26.480\n look, you know, we're trying to do a very specific thing\n\n27:26.480 --> 27:27.320\n here on Stack Overflow.\n\n27:27.320 --> 27:29.160\n We're not trying to solve all the world's problems.\n\n27:29.160 --> 27:31.000\n We're trying to solve this very specific Q and A problem\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:32.400\n in a very specific way.\n\n27:32.400 --> 27:33.640\n Not cause we're jerks about it,\n\n27:33.640 --> 27:36.040\n but because these strict set of rules\n\n27:36.040 --> 27:39.440\n help us get really good results, right?\n\n27:39.440 --> 27:41.520\n And programmers, that's an easy sell for the most part\n\n27:41.520 --> 27:42.600\n because programmers are used to dealing\n\n27:42.600 --> 27:45.120\n with ridiculous systems of rules like constantly.\n\n27:45.120 --> 27:46.840\n That's basically their job.\n\n27:46.840 --> 27:49.520\n So they're very, oh yeah, super strict system of rules\n\n27:49.520 --> 27:50.440\n that lets me get what I want.\n\n27:50.440 --> 27:51.620\n That's programming, right?\n\n27:51.620 --> 27:53.680\n That's what Stack Overflow is, so.\n\n27:53.680 --> 27:54.920\n So you're making it sound easy,\n\n27:54.920 --> 27:58.000\n but in 2004, let's go back there.\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.520\n In 2004, you started the blog, Coding Horror.\n\n28:01.520 --> 28:03.600\n Was it called that at the very beginning?\n\n28:03.600 --> 28:04.440\n It was.\n\n28:04.440 --> 28:05.280\n One of the smart things I did,\n\n28:05.280 --> 28:06.720\n it's from a book by Steve McConnell, Code Complete,\n\n28:06.720 --> 28:08.240\n which is one of my favorite programming books,\n\n28:08.240 --> 28:09.800\n still probably my number one programming book\n\n28:09.800 --> 28:10.800\n for anyone to read.\n\n28:10.800 --> 28:13.840\n So one of the smart things I did back then,\n\n28:13.840 --> 28:16.080\n I don't always do smart things when I start stuff.\n\n28:16.080 --> 28:18.400\n I contacted Steve and said, hey, I really like this.\n\n28:18.400 --> 28:19.640\n It was a sidebar illustration\n\n28:19.640 --> 28:21.820\n indicating danger in code, right?\n\n28:21.820 --> 28:23.880\n Coding Horror was like, watch out.\n\n28:25.320 --> 28:27.360\n And I love that illustration because it spoke to me.\n\n28:27.360 --> 28:29.520\n Because I saw that illustration go, oh my God, that's me.\n\n28:29.520 --> 28:31.080\n Like I'm always my own worst enemy.\n\n28:31.080 --> 28:33.360\n Like that's the key insight in programming is\n\n28:33.360 --> 28:34.320\n every time you write something,\n\n28:34.320 --> 28:36.600\n think how am I gonna screw myself?\n\n28:36.600 --> 28:39.280\n Because you will, constantly, right?\n\n28:39.280 --> 28:41.280\n So that icon was like, oh yeah,\n\n28:41.280 --> 28:43.200\n I need to constantly hold that mirror up and look,\n\n28:43.200 --> 28:45.440\n and say, look, you're very fallible.\n\n28:45.440 --> 28:46.400\n You're gonna screw this up.\n\n28:46.400 --> 28:48.040\n Like how can you build this in such a way\n\n28:48.040 --> 28:50.380\n that you're not gonna screw it up later?\n\n28:50.380 --> 28:53.040\n Like how can you get that discipline around\n\n28:53.040 --> 28:54.920\n making sure at every step I'm thinking through\n\n28:54.920 --> 28:56.200\n all the things that I could do wrong\n\n28:56.200 --> 28:57.280\n or that other people could do wrong?\n\n28:57.280 --> 28:58.920\n Because that is actually how you get to be\n\n28:58.920 --> 29:00.600\n a better programmer a lot of times, right?\n\n29:00.600 --> 29:03.400\n So that sidebar illustration, I loved it so much.\n\n29:03.400 --> 29:05.640\n And I wrote Steve before I started my blog and said,\n\n29:05.640 --> 29:06.800\n hey, can I have permission to use this\n\n29:06.800 --> 29:08.460\n because I just really like this illustration?\n\n29:08.460 --> 29:11.280\n And Steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that\n\n29:11.280 --> 29:13.280\n and just continues to give me permission, so yeah.\n\n29:13.280 --> 29:15.080\n Really, that's awesome.\n\n29:15.080 --> 29:18.880\n But in 2004, you started this blog.\n\n29:18.880 --> 29:22.600\n You know, you look at Stephen King, his book on writing,\n\n29:22.600 --> 29:26.460\n or Stephen Pressfield, War of Art book.\n\n29:26.460 --> 29:30.040\n I mean, it seems like writers suffer.\n\n29:30.040 --> 29:32.080\n I mean, it's a hard process of writing, right?\n\n29:32.080 --> 29:34.200\n There's gonna be suffering.\n\n29:34.200 --> 29:35.200\n I mean, I won't kid you.\n\n29:35.200 --> 29:36.400\n Well, the work is suffering, right?\n\n29:36.400 --> 29:38.680\n Like doing the work, like even when you're every week,\n\n29:38.680 --> 29:40.280\n you're like, okay, that blog post wasn't very good\n\n29:40.280 --> 29:43.360\n or people didn't like it or people said disparaging things\n\n29:43.360 --> 29:44.200\n about it.\n\n29:44.200 --> 29:47.440\n You have to like have the attitude like, you know,\n\n29:47.440 --> 29:49.480\n no matter what happens, I wanna do this for me, right?\n\n29:49.480 --> 29:51.220\n It's not about you, it's about me.\n\n29:51.220 --> 29:53.320\n I mean, in the end, it is about everyone\n\n29:53.320 --> 29:55.840\n because this is how good work gets out into the world.\n\n29:55.840 --> 29:59.780\n But you have to be pretty strict about saying like,\n\n29:59.780 --> 30:01.640\n you know, I'm selfish in the sense\n\n30:01.640 --> 30:03.260\n that I have to do this for me.\n\n30:03.260 --> 30:04.360\n You know, you mentioned Stephen King,\n\n30:04.360 --> 30:05.460\n like his book on writing.\n\n30:05.460 --> 30:06.840\n But like one of the things I do, for example,\n\n30:06.840 --> 30:08.680\n when writing is like, I read it out loud.\n\n30:08.680 --> 30:10.640\n One of the best pieces of advice for writing anything\n\n30:10.640 --> 30:13.880\n is read it out loud, like multiple times\n\n30:13.880 --> 30:15.800\n and make it sound like you're talking\n\n30:15.800 --> 30:17.840\n because that is the goal of good writing.\n\n30:17.840 --> 30:19.200\n It should sound like you said it\n\n30:19.200 --> 30:20.840\n with slightly better phrasing\n\n30:20.840 --> 30:22.080\n because you have more time to think about what you're saying\n\n30:22.080 --> 30:24.360\n but like, it should sound natural when you say it.\n\n30:24.360 --> 30:26.560\n And I think that's probably the single best\n\n30:26.560 --> 30:27.560\n writing advice I can give anyone.\n\n30:27.560 --> 30:29.760\n Just read it over and over out loud,\n\n30:29.760 --> 30:32.600\n make sure it sounds like something you would normally say\n\n30:32.600 --> 30:33.680\n and it sounds good.\n\n30:33.680 --> 30:35.600\n And what's your process of writing?\n\n30:35.600 --> 30:37.800\n See, there's usually a pretty good idea\n\n30:37.800 --> 30:39.360\n behind the blog post.\n\n30:39.360 --> 30:40.200\n So ideas, right.\n\n30:40.200 --> 30:43.300\n So I think you gotta have the concept\n\n30:43.300 --> 30:46.180\n that there's so many interesting things in the world.\n\n30:46.180 --> 30:48.800\n Like, I mean, my God, the world is amazing, right?\n\n30:48.800 --> 30:51.960\n Like you can never write about everything that's going on\n\n30:51.960 --> 30:52.800\n because it's so incredible.\n\n30:52.800 --> 30:54.180\n But if you can't come up with like,\n\n30:54.180 --> 30:57.100\n let's say one interesting thing per day to talk about,\n\n30:57.100 --> 30:58.360\n then you're not trying hard enough\n\n30:58.360 --> 31:00.720\n because the world is full of just super interesting stuff.\n\n31:00.720 --> 31:03.120\n And one great way to like mine stuff\n\n31:03.120 --> 31:04.240\n is go back to old books\n\n31:04.240 --> 31:07.200\n cause they bring up old stuff that's still super relevant.\n\n31:07.200 --> 31:08.160\n And I did that a lot\n\n31:08.160 --> 31:09.880\n cause I was like reading classic programming books\n\n31:09.880 --> 31:11.260\n and a lot of the early blog posts were like,\n\n31:11.260 --> 31:12.280\n oh, I was reading this programming book\n\n31:12.280 --> 31:13.760\n and they brought this really cool concept\n\n31:13.760 --> 31:15.000\n and I wanna talk about it some more.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:16.080\n And you get the, I mean,\n\n31:16.080 --> 31:17.280\n you're not claiming credit for the idea\n\n31:17.280 --> 31:18.660\n but it gives you something interesting to talk about\n\n31:18.660 --> 31:19.880\n that's kind of evergreen, right?\n\n31:19.880 --> 31:21.960\n Like you don't have to go, what should I talk about?\n\n31:21.960 --> 31:24.600\n So we'll just go dig up some old classic programming books\n\n31:24.600 --> 31:26.980\n and find something that, oh, wow, that's interesting.\n\n31:26.980 --> 31:28.160\n Or how does that apply today?\n\n31:28.160 --> 31:30.960\n Or what about X and Y or compare these two concepts.\n\n31:30.960 --> 31:33.200\n So pull a couple of sentences from that book\n\n31:33.200 --> 31:34.720\n and then sort of play off of it,\n\n31:34.720 --> 31:36.160\n almost agree or disagree.\n\n31:36.160 --> 31:41.160\n So in 2007, you wrote that you were offered\n\n31:41.880 --> 31:44.440\n a significant amount of money to sell the blog.\n\n31:44.440 --> 31:45.960\n You chose not to.\n\n31:45.960 --> 31:48.960\n What were all the elements you were thinking about?\n\n31:48.960 --> 31:50.520\n Cause I'd like to take you back.\n\n31:50.520 --> 31:52.520\n It seems like there's a lot of nonlinear decisions\n\n31:52.520 --> 31:54.320\n you made through life.\n\n31:54.320 --> 31:56.040\n So what was that decision like?\n\n31:56.040 --> 31:57.840\n Right, so one of the things I love\n\n31:57.840 --> 31:59.360\n is the Choose Your Own Adventure books,\n\n31:59.360 --> 32:00.280\n which I loved as a kid\n\n32:00.280 --> 32:01.720\n and I feel like they're early programmer books\n\n32:01.720 --> 32:04.040\n cause they're all about if then statements, right?\n\n32:04.040 --> 32:05.080\n If this, then this.\n\n32:05.080 --> 32:07.240\n And they're also very, very unforgiving.\n\n32:07.240 --> 32:08.920\n Like there's all these sites that map\n\n32:08.920 --> 32:11.040\n the classic Choose Your Own Adventure books\n\n32:11.040 --> 32:13.940\n and how many outcomes are bad, a lot of bad outcomes.\n\n32:13.940 --> 32:16.080\n So part of the game is like, oh, I got a bad outcome.\n\n32:16.080 --> 32:17.840\n Go back one step, go back one further step.\n\n32:17.840 --> 32:19.160\n It's like, how did I get here, right?\n\n32:19.160 --> 32:21.900\n Like it's a sequence of decisions.\n\n32:21.900 --> 32:23.160\n And this is true of life, right?\n\n32:23.160 --> 32:24.960\n Like every decision is a sequence, right?\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:28.320\n Individually, any individual decision\n\n32:28.320 --> 32:29.240\n is not necessarily right or wrong,\n\n32:29.240 --> 32:31.040\n but they lead you down a path, right?\n\n32:31.040 --> 32:32.760\n So I do think there's some truth to that.\n\n32:32.760 --> 32:34.740\n So this particular decision,\n\n32:34.740 --> 32:36.320\n the blog had gotten fairly popular.\n\n32:36.320 --> 32:39.080\n There's a lot of RSS readers that I had discovered.\n\n32:39.080 --> 32:40.980\n And this guy contacted me out of the blue\n\n32:40.980 --> 32:42.440\n from this like bug tracking company.\n\n32:42.440 --> 32:43.840\n He's like, oh, I really wanna buy your blog\n\n32:43.840 --> 32:46.040\n for like, I think it was around,\n\n32:46.040 --> 32:47.920\n it was $100,000, it might have been like 80,000,\n\n32:47.920 --> 32:49.240\n but it was a lot, right?\n\n32:49.240 --> 32:51.120\n Like, and that's, you know, at the time,\n\n32:51.120 --> 32:54.420\n like I would have a year's worth of salary all at once.\n\n32:54.420 --> 32:57.720\n So I didn't really think about like, well, you know,\n\n32:57.720 --> 32:58.560\n and I remember talking to people at the time,\n\n32:58.560 --> 32:59.840\n I was like, wow, that's a lot of money.\n\n32:59.840 --> 33:02.000\n But then I'm like, I really like my blog, right?\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.720\n Like, do I wanna sell my blog?\n\n33:03.720 --> 33:05.940\n Cause it wouldn't really belong to me anymore at that point.\n\n33:05.940 --> 33:09.360\n And one of the guidelines that I like to,\n\n33:09.360 --> 33:11.040\n I don't like to give advice to people a lot,\n\n33:11.040 --> 33:12.520\n but one of the pieces of advice I do give,\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:15.560\n cause I do think it's really true and it's generally helpful\n\n33:15.560 --> 33:17.600\n is whenever you're looking at a set of decisions,\n\n33:17.600 --> 33:19.860\n like, oh gosh, should I do A, B or C,\n\n33:19.860 --> 33:22.500\n you gotta pick the thing that's a little scarier\n\n33:22.500 --> 33:24.540\n in that list because not, you know,\n\n33:24.540 --> 33:25.680\n not like jump off a cliff scary,\n\n33:25.680 --> 33:27.000\n but the thing that makes you nervous.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\n Cause if you pick the safe choice,\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.380\n it's usually, you're not really pushing.\n\n33:30.380 --> 33:31.400\n You're not pushing yourself.\n\n33:31.400 --> 33:33.940\n You're not choosing the thing that's gonna help you grow.\n\n33:33.940 --> 33:36.160\n So for me, the scarier choice was to say no.\n\n33:36.160 --> 33:38.040\n I was like, well, no, let's just see where this is going.\n\n33:38.040 --> 33:38.880\n Right?\n\n33:38.880 --> 33:39.700\n Because then I own it.\n\n33:39.700 --> 33:40.540\n I mean, it belongs to me.\n\n33:40.540 --> 33:42.000\n It's my thing.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.120\n And I can just take it\n\n33:43.120 --> 33:45.360\n and tell some other logical conclusion, right?\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:46.880\n Because imagine how different the world would have been\n\n33:46.880 --> 33:49.040\n had I said yes and sold the blog.\n\n33:49.040 --> 33:51.560\n It's like, there probably wouldn't be Stack Overflow.\n\n33:51.560 --> 33:53.640\n You know, a lot of other stuff would have changed.\n\n33:53.640 --> 33:55.360\n So for that particular decision,\n\n33:55.360 --> 33:56.280\n I think it was that same rule.\n\n33:56.280 --> 33:57.920\n Like what scares me a little bit more.\n\n33:57.920 --> 33:59.200\n Do the thing that scares you.\n\n33:59.200 --> 34:00.040\n Yeah.\n\n34:00.040 --> 34:01.740\n So speaking of which, startups.\n\n34:01.740 --> 34:05.000\n I think there's a specific, some more general questions\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.560\n that a lot of people would be interested in.\n\n34:07.560 --> 34:10.320\n You've started Stack Overflow.\n\n34:10.320 --> 34:12.080\n You started this course.\n\n34:12.080 --> 34:15.320\n So what's the, it was one, two, three guys,\n\n34:15.320 --> 34:17.200\n whatever it is in the beginning.\n\n34:17.200 --> 34:19.360\n What was that process like?\n\n34:19.360 --> 34:20.680\n Do you start talking about it?\n\n34:20.680 --> 34:21.800\n Do you start programming?\n\n34:21.800 --> 34:24.560\n Do you start, like, where's the birth\n\n34:24.560 --> 34:25.880\n and the catalyst that actually.\n\n34:25.880 --> 34:27.040\n Well, I can talk about it in the context\n\n34:27.040 --> 34:28.120\n of both Stack Overflow and Discourse.\n\n34:28.120 --> 34:31.080\n So I think the key thing initially is there is a problem.\n\n34:31.080 --> 34:32.440\n Something, there's some state of the world\n\n34:32.440 --> 34:34.400\n that's unsatisfactory to the point that, like,\n\n34:34.400 --> 34:35.960\n you're upset about it, right?\n\n34:35.960 --> 34:37.840\n Like, in that case, it was experts exchange.\n\n34:37.840 --> 34:38.960\n I mean, Joel's original idea,\n\n34:38.960 --> 34:40.200\n because I approached Joel as like,\n\n34:40.200 --> 34:41.760\n look, Joel, I have all this energy behind my blog.\n\n34:41.760 --> 34:42.600\n I want to do something.\n\n34:42.600 --> 34:43.440\n I want to build something.\n\n34:43.440 --> 34:44.260\n But I don't know what it is,\n\n34:44.260 --> 34:45.720\n because I'm honestly not a good idea person.\n\n34:45.720 --> 34:46.560\n I'm really not.\n\n34:46.560 --> 34:47.760\n I'm like the execution guy.\n\n34:47.760 --> 34:48.680\n I'm really good at execution,\n\n34:48.680 --> 34:51.000\n but I'm not good at, like, blue skying ideas.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:52.080\n Not my forte.\n\n34:52.080 --> 34:54.080\n Which is another reason why I like the community feedback,\n\n34:54.080 --> 34:56.320\n because they blue sky all day long for you, right?\n\n34:56.320 --> 34:57.760\n So when I can just go in and cherry pick\n\n34:57.760 --> 34:59.320\n a blue sky idea from community,\n\n34:59.320 --> 35:00.800\n even if I have to spend three hours reading\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:02.720\n to get one good idea, it's worth it, man.\n\n35:02.720 --> 35:04.680\n But anyway, so the idea from Joel was,\n\n35:04.680 --> 35:07.400\n hey, experts exchange, it's got great data,\n\n35:07.400 --> 35:09.040\n but the experience is hideous, right?\n\n35:09.040 --> 35:09.920\n It's trying to trick you.\n\n35:09.920 --> 35:11.040\n It feels like used car salesman.\n\n35:11.040 --> 35:12.040\n It's just bad.\n\n35:12.040 --> 35:13.080\n So I was like, oh, that's awesome.\n\n35:13.080 --> 35:14.280\n It feeds into community.\n\n35:14.280 --> 35:15.120\n It feeds into, like, you know,\n\n35:15.120 --> 35:16.680\n we can make creative comments.\n\n35:16.680 --> 35:18.520\n So I think the core is to have a really good idea\n\n35:18.520 --> 35:20.280\n that you feel very strongly about in the beginning,\n\n35:20.280 --> 35:22.000\n that, like, there's a wrong in the world,\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.240\n an injustice that we will write\n\n35:24.240 --> 35:26.080\n through the process of building this thing.\n\n35:26.080 --> 35:27.480\n For Discourse, it was like, look,\n\n35:27.480 --> 35:30.160\n there's no good software for communities\n\n35:30.160 --> 35:32.920\n to just hang out and, like, do stuff, right?\n\n35:32.920 --> 35:35.440\n Like, whether it's problem solving, startup, whatever.\n\n35:35.440 --> 35:37.600\n Forums are such a great building block of online community,\n\n35:37.600 --> 35:38.560\n and they're hideous.\n\n35:38.560 --> 35:39.720\n They were so bad, right?\n\n35:39.720 --> 35:40.720\n It was embarrassing.\n\n35:40.720 --> 35:42.000\n Like, I literally was embarrassed\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:43.920\n to be associated with this software, right?\n\n35:43.920 --> 35:45.680\n I was like, we have to have software that you can be proud of.\n\n35:45.680 --> 35:47.080\n It's like, this is competitive with Reddit.\n\n35:47.080 --> 35:48.320\n This is competitive with Twitter.\n\n35:48.320 --> 35:50.320\n This is competitive with Facebook, right?\n\n35:50.320 --> 35:53.440\n I would be proud to have the software on my site.\n\n35:53.440 --> 35:54.840\n So that was the genesis of Discourse,\n\n35:54.840 --> 35:59.840\n was feeling very strongly about there needs to be\n\n35:59.840 --> 36:01.680\n a good solution for communities.\n\n36:01.680 --> 36:02.640\n So that's step one.\n\n36:02.640 --> 36:04.520\n Genesis of an idea you feel super strongly about, right?\n\n36:04.520 --> 36:06.600\n And then people galvanize around the idea.\n\n36:06.600 --> 36:08.480\n Like, Joel was already super excited about the idea.\n\n36:08.480 --> 36:09.920\n I was excited about the idea.\n\n36:09.920 --> 36:13.240\n So with the forum software, I was posting on Twitter.\n\n36:13.240 --> 36:15.000\n I had researched, as part of my research,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:16.600\n I start researching the problem, right?\n\n36:16.600 --> 36:19.480\n And I found a game called Forum Wars,\n\n36:19.480 --> 36:21.480\n which was a parody of forum.\n\n36:21.480 --> 36:23.680\n It's still very, very funny, of forum behavior,\n\n36:23.680 --> 36:26.120\n circa, I would say, 2003.\n\n36:26.120 --> 36:27.720\n It's aged some, right?\n\n36:27.720 --> 36:29.880\n Like, the behavior's a little different in there of Twitter.\n\n36:29.880 --> 36:30.920\n But it was awesome.\n\n36:30.920 --> 36:31.920\n It was very funny.\n\n36:31.920 --> 36:32.800\n And it was like a game.\n\n36:32.800 --> 36:33.520\n It was like an RPG.\n\n36:33.520 --> 36:34.960\n And it had a forum attached to it.\n\n36:34.960 --> 36:37.520\n So it was like a game about forums with a forum attached.\n\n36:37.520 --> 36:38.520\n I was like, this is awesome, right?\n\n36:38.520 --> 36:39.520\n This is so cool.\n\n36:39.520 --> 36:41.920\n And the founder of that company, or that project,\n\n36:41.920 --> 36:43.720\n it wasn't really a company, contacted me,\n\n36:43.720 --> 36:45.440\n this guy Robin Ward from Toronto.\n\n36:45.440 --> 36:47.400\n He said, hey, I saw you've been talking about forums.\n\n36:47.400 --> 36:49.120\n And I really love that problem space.\n\n36:49.120 --> 36:51.280\n He was like, I'd still love to build really good forum\n\n36:51.280 --> 36:53.440\n software, because I don't think anything out there's any good.\n\n36:53.440 --> 36:54.200\n And I was like, awesome.\n\n36:54.200 --> 36:55.880\n At that point, I was like, we're starting a company.\n\n36:55.880 --> 36:58.600\n Because I couldn't have whooshed for a better person\n\n36:58.600 --> 37:01.000\n to walk through the door and say, I'm excited about this,\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:01.560\n too.\n\n37:01.560 --> 37:02.360\n Same thing with Joel, right?\n\n37:02.360 --> 37:04.000\n I mean, Joel is a legend in the industry, right?\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:04.760\n So when he walked through and said,\n\n37:04.760 --> 37:06.960\n I'm excited about this problem, I was like, me too, man.\n\n37:06.960 --> 37:08.200\n We can do this, right?\n\n37:08.200 --> 37:10.600\n So that, to me, is the most important step.\n\n37:10.600 --> 37:12.840\n It's like, having an idea you're super excited about,\n\n37:12.840 --> 37:14.640\n and another person, a cofounder, right?\n\n37:14.640 --> 37:16.760\n Because again, you get that dual leadership, right?\n\n37:16.760 --> 37:19.120\n Am I making a bad decision?\n\n37:19.120 --> 37:21.500\n Sometimes it's nice to have checks of like,\n\n37:21.500 --> 37:22.440\n is this a good idea?\n\n37:22.440 --> 37:23.680\n I don't know, right?\n\n37:23.680 --> 37:25.600\n So those are the crucial seeds.\n\n37:25.600 --> 37:27.520\n But then starting to build stuff,\n\n37:27.520 --> 37:28.360\n whether it's you programming or somebody else's.\n\n37:28.360 --> 37:29.360\n There is prototyping.\n\n37:29.360 --> 37:30.600\n So there's tons of research.\n\n37:30.600 --> 37:32.880\n There's tons of research, like, what's out there that failed?\n\n37:32.880 --> 37:34.360\n Because a lot of people look at the successes.\n\n37:34.360 --> 37:36.080\n Oh, look at how successful X is.\n\n37:36.080 --> 37:37.360\n Everybody looks at the successes.\n\n37:37.360 --> 37:38.360\n Those are boring.\n\n37:38.360 --> 37:40.860\n Show me the failures, because that is what's interesting.\n\n37:40.860 --> 37:42.080\n That's where people were experimenting.\n\n37:42.080 --> 37:43.960\n That's where people were pushing.\n\n37:43.960 --> 37:45.560\n And they failed, but they probably\n\n37:45.560 --> 37:47.480\n failed for reasons that weren't directly\n\n37:47.480 --> 37:50.040\n about the quality of their idea, right?\n\n37:50.040 --> 37:51.400\n So look at all the failures.\n\n37:51.400 --> 37:53.200\n Don't just look what everybody looks at, which is like, oh,\n\n37:53.200 --> 37:54.620\n gosh, look at all these successful people.\n\n37:54.620 --> 37:55.920\n Look at the failures.\n\n37:55.920 --> 37:57.240\n Look at the things that didn't work.\n\n37:57.240 --> 37:59.040\n Research the entire field.\n\n37:59.040 --> 38:01.440\n And so that's the research that I was doing\n\n38:01.440 --> 38:02.720\n that led me to Robin, right?\n\n38:02.720 --> 38:03.560\n Was that.\n\n38:03.560 --> 38:07.520\n And then when we, for example, when we did Stack Overflow,\n\n38:07.520 --> 38:08.960\n we're like, okay, well, I really like elements\n\n38:08.960 --> 38:10.000\n of voting and dig and read it.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.760\n I like the Wikipedia, everything's up to date.\n\n38:12.760 --> 38:14.280\n Nothing is like an old tombstone\n\n38:14.280 --> 38:16.940\n that has horrible out of date information.\n\n38:16.940 --> 38:17.780\n We know that works.\n\n38:17.780 --> 38:19.360\n Wikipedia is an amazing resource.\n\n38:19.360 --> 38:22.360\n Blogging, the idea of ownership is so powerful, right?\n\n38:22.360 --> 38:23.960\n Like, oh, I, Joe wrote this,\n\n38:23.960 --> 38:26.200\n and look how good Joe's answer is, right?\n\n38:26.200 --> 38:27.720\n All these concepts were rolling together.\n\n38:27.720 --> 38:29.040\n Researching all the things that were out there\n\n38:29.040 --> 38:30.600\n that were working and why they were working\n\n38:30.600 --> 38:32.360\n and trying to fold them into, again,\n\n38:32.360 --> 38:35.280\n that Frankenstein's monster of what Stack Overflow is.\n\n38:35.280 --> 38:37.040\n And by the way, that wasn't a free decision\n\n38:37.040 --> 38:38.720\n because there's still a ton of tension\n\n38:38.720 --> 38:40.000\n in the Stack Overflow system.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.560\n There's reasons people complain about Stack Overflow\n\n38:42.560 --> 38:43.640\n because it's so strict, right?\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:44.640\n Why is it so strict?\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:46.480\n Why are you guys always closing my questions?\n\n38:46.480 --> 38:47.880\n It's because there's so much tension\n\n38:47.880 --> 38:49.120\n that we built into the system\n\n38:49.120 --> 38:51.880\n around trying to get good, good results out of the system.\n\n38:51.880 --> 38:56.000\n And it's not a free.\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:57.520\n That stuff doesn't come for free, right?\n\n38:57.520 --> 38:59.800\n It's not like we, we all have perfect answers\n\n38:59.800 --> 39:02.280\n and nobody will have to get their feelings heard\n\n39:02.280 --> 39:04.560\n or nobody will have to get downvoted.\n\n39:04.560 --> 39:06.640\n It doesn't work that way, right?\n\n39:06.640 --> 39:09.400\n So this is an interesting point and a small tangent.\n\n39:09.400 --> 39:12.000\n You write about anxiety.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.040\n So I've posted a lot of questions\n\n39:14.040 --> 39:16.040\n and written answers on Stack Overflow.\n\n39:16.040 --> 39:18.320\n On the question side, you usually go to\n\n39:18.320 --> 39:21.160\n something very specific to something I'm working on.\n\n39:21.160 --> 39:22.280\n And this is something you talk about\n\n39:22.280 --> 39:26.120\n that really the goal of Stack Overflow isn't about,\n\n39:26.120 --> 39:29.360\n is to write a question that's not about you,\n\n39:29.360 --> 39:33.480\n it's about the question that will help\n\n39:33.480 --> 39:35.800\n the community in the future.\n\n39:35.800 --> 39:37.520\n Right, but that's a tough sell, right?\n\n39:37.520 --> 39:39.160\n Because people are like, well,\n\n39:39.160 --> 39:40.280\n I don't really care about the community.\n\n39:40.280 --> 39:41.520\n What I care about is my problem.\n\n39:41.520 --> 39:43.400\n And that's fair, right?\n\n39:43.400 --> 39:44.880\n It's sort of that, again, that tension,\n\n39:44.880 --> 39:46.680\n that balancing act of we wanna help you,\n\n39:46.680 --> 39:48.640\n but we also wanna help everybody that comes behind you.\n\n39:48.640 --> 39:49.880\n The long line of people are gonna come up and say,\n\n39:49.880 --> 39:52.240\n oh, I kinda have that problem too, right?\n\n39:52.240 --> 39:54.040\n And if nobody's ever gonna come up and say,\n\n39:54.040 --> 39:54.880\n I have this problem too,\n\n39:54.880 --> 39:57.000\n then that question shouldn't exist on Stack Overflow\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:58.840\n because the question is too specific.\n\n39:58.840 --> 40:00.040\n And even that's tension, right?\n\n40:00.040 --> 40:00.880\n How do you judge that?\n\n40:00.880 --> 40:02.600\n How do you know that nobody's ever gonna have\n\n40:02.600 --> 40:04.680\n this particular question again?\n\n40:04.680 --> 40:06.800\n So there's a lot of tension in the system.\n\n40:06.800 --> 40:09.560\n Do you think that anxiety of asking the question,\n\n40:09.560 --> 40:11.560\n the anxiety of answering,\n\n40:11.560 --> 40:14.200\n that tension is inherent to programmers,\n\n40:14.200 --> 40:16.960\n is inherent to this kind of process?\n\n40:16.960 --> 40:20.320\n Or can it be improved?\n\n40:20.320 --> 40:22.440\n Can it be happy land\n\n40:22.440 --> 40:25.820\n where that tension is not quite so harsh?\n\n40:26.880 --> 40:28.120\n I don't think Stack Overflow\n\n40:28.120 --> 40:30.040\n can totally change the way it works.\n\n40:30.040 --> 40:31.800\n One thing they are working on finally\n\n40:31.800 --> 40:35.200\n is the ask page had not changed since 2011.\n\n40:35.200 --> 40:36.760\n I'm still kind of bitter about this\n\n40:36.760 --> 40:39.360\n because I feel like you have a Q&A system\n\n40:39.360 --> 40:41.400\n and what are the core pages in a Q&A system?\n\n40:41.400 --> 40:42.240\n Well, first of all, the question,\n\n40:42.240 --> 40:43.760\n all the answers and also the ask page,\n\n40:43.760 --> 40:45.120\n particularly when you're a new user\n\n40:45.120 --> 40:46.520\n or someone trying to ask a question,\n\n40:46.520 --> 40:48.400\n that's the point at which you need the most help.\n\n40:48.400 --> 40:50.760\n And we just didn't adapt with the times.\n\n40:50.760 --> 40:52.320\n But the good news is they're working on this,\n\n40:52.320 --> 40:53.200\n from what I understand,\n\n40:53.200 --> 40:55.180\n and it's gonna be a more wizard based format.\n\n40:55.180 --> 40:56.820\n And you could envision a world\n\n40:56.820 --> 40:58.420\n where as part of this wizard based program,\n\n40:58.420 --> 40:59.360\n when you're asking questions,\n\n40:59.360 --> 41:01.080\n okay, come up with a good title,\n\n41:01.080 --> 41:02.560\n what are good words to put in the title?\n\n41:02.560 --> 41:04.280\n One word that's not good to put in the title\n\n41:04.280 --> 41:05.880\n is problem, for example.\n\n41:05.880 --> 41:06.700\n I have a problem.\n\n41:06.700 --> 41:07.760\n Oh, you have a problem.\n\n41:07.760 --> 41:10.400\n Okay, a problem, that's great.\n\n41:10.400 --> 41:11.400\n You need specifics.\n\n41:11.400 --> 41:13.440\n So it's trying to help you make a good question title,\n\n41:13.440 --> 41:17.280\n for example, that step will be broken out, all that stuff.\n\n41:17.280 --> 41:19.560\n But one of those steps in that wizard of asking\n\n41:19.560 --> 41:21.600\n could say, hey, I'm a little nervous.\n\n41:21.600 --> 41:22.660\n I've never done this before.\n\n41:22.660 --> 41:26.080\n Can you put me in a queue for special mentoring?\n\n41:26.080 --> 41:27.560\n You could opt in to a special mentor.\n\n41:27.560 --> 41:28.960\n I think that would be fantastic.\n\n41:28.960 --> 41:31.360\n I don't have any objection to that at all\n\n41:31.360 --> 41:32.600\n in terms of being an opt in system.\n\n41:32.600 --> 41:33.920\n Because there are people that are like,\n\n41:33.920 --> 41:35.480\n I just wanna help them.\n\n41:35.480 --> 41:36.720\n I wanna help a person no matter what.\n\n41:36.720 --> 41:37.920\n I wanna go above and beyond.\n\n41:37.920 --> 41:40.160\n I wanna spend hours with this person.\n\n41:41.320 --> 41:42.960\n It depends what their goals are.\n\n41:42.960 --> 41:43.780\n It's a great idea.\n\n41:43.780 --> 41:44.620\n Who am I to judge?\n\n41:44.620 --> 41:45.460\n So that's fine.\n\n41:45.460 --> 41:47.320\n It's not precluded from happening.\n\n41:47.320 --> 41:49.000\n But there's a certain big city ethos\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:49.840\n that we started with.\n\n41:49.840 --> 41:51.080\n Like, look, we're in New York City.\n\n41:51.080 --> 41:52.040\n You don't come to New York City\n\n41:52.040 --> 41:54.360\n and expect them to be, oh, welcome to the city, Joe.\n\n41:54.360 --> 41:55.200\n How's it going?\n\n41:55.200 --> 41:56.020\n Come on in.\n\n41:56.020 --> 41:57.120\n Let me show you around.\n\n41:57.120 --> 41:58.920\n That's not how New York City works.\n\n42:01.480 --> 42:03.060\n Again, New York City has a reputation for being rude,\n\n42:03.060 --> 42:04.080\n which I actually don't think it is,\n\n42:04.080 --> 42:05.240\n having been there fairly recently.\n\n42:05.240 --> 42:06.080\n It's not rude.\n\n42:06.080 --> 42:07.240\n It's just like going about their business.\n\n42:07.240 --> 42:08.980\n Like, look, I have things to do.\n\n42:08.980 --> 42:09.820\n I'm busy.\n\n42:09.820 --> 42:11.840\n I'm a busy professional, as are you.\n\n42:11.840 --> 42:13.440\n And since you're a busy professional,\n\n42:13.440 --> 42:14.680\n certainly when you ask a question,\n\n42:14.680 --> 42:16.440\n you're gonna ask the best possible question.\n\n42:16.440 --> 42:18.220\n Because you're a busy professional\n\n42:18.220 --> 42:20.160\n and you would not accept anything less\n\n42:20.160 --> 42:21.420\n than a very well written question\n\n42:21.420 --> 42:23.280\n with a lot of detail about why you're doing it,\n\n42:23.280 --> 42:25.060\n what you're doing, what you researched,\n\n42:25.060 --> 42:26.200\n what you found,\n\n42:26.200 --> 42:28.600\n because you're a professional like me.\n\n42:28.600 --> 42:31.000\n And this rubs people sometimes the wrong way.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:32.320\n And I don't think it's wrong to say,\n\n42:32.320 --> 42:33.680\n look, I don't want that experience.\n\n42:33.680 --> 42:37.600\n I want just a more chill place for beginners.\n\n42:37.600 --> 42:39.160\n And I still think Stack Overflow\n\n42:39.160 --> 42:41.960\n is not, was never designed for beginners, right?\n\n42:41.960 --> 42:43.840\n There's this misconception that,\n\n42:43.840 --> 42:44.800\n even Joel says sometimes,\n\n42:44.800 --> 42:46.120\n oh yeah, Stack Overflow for beginners.\n\n42:46.120 --> 42:48.840\n And I think if you're a prodigy, it can be.\n\n42:48.840 --> 42:49.660\n Right.\n\n42:49.660 --> 42:50.500\n But for the most part, not.\n\n42:50.500 --> 42:51.760\n But that's not really representative, right?\n\n42:51.760 --> 42:53.060\n Like, I think as a beginner,\n\n42:53.060 --> 42:55.120\n you want a totally different set of tools.\n\n42:55.120 --> 42:58.060\n You want like live screen sharing, live chat.\n\n42:58.060 --> 42:59.220\n You want access to resources.\n\n42:59.220 --> 43:00.260\n You want a playground,\n\n43:00.260 --> 43:02.360\n like a playground you can experiment in\n\n43:02.360 --> 43:04.480\n and like test and all this stuff\n\n43:04.480 --> 43:05.640\n that we just don't give people\n\n43:05.640 --> 43:07.780\n because that was never really the audience\n\n43:07.780 --> 43:09.280\n that we were designing Stack Overflow for.\n\n43:09.280 --> 43:10.680\n That doesn't mean it's wrong.\n\n43:10.680 --> 43:11.800\n And I think it would be awesome\n\n43:11.800 --> 43:13.280\n if there was a site like that on the internet,\n\n43:13.280 --> 43:14.320\n or if Stack Overflow said,\n\n43:14.320 --> 43:15.800\n hey, you know, we're gonna start doing this.\n\n43:15.800 --> 43:16.960\n That's fine too.\n\n43:16.960 --> 43:17.800\n You know, I'm not there.\n\n43:17.800 --> 43:18.680\n I'm not making those decisions.\n\n43:18.680 --> 43:20.640\n But I do think the pressure,\n\n43:20.640 --> 43:22.800\n the tension that you described is there for people to be,\n\n43:22.800 --> 43:24.480\n look, I'm a little nervous\n\n43:24.480 --> 43:26.400\n because I know I gotta do my best work, right?\n\n43:26.400 --> 43:28.040\n The other one is something you talk about,\n\n43:28.040 --> 43:30.320\n which is also really interesting to me,\n\n43:30.320 --> 43:35.320\n is duplicate questions or it's a really difficult problem\n\n43:37.160 --> 43:38.080\n that you highlight.\n\n43:38.080 --> 43:39.480\n It's super hard.\n\n43:39.480 --> 43:41.720\n Like you could take one little topic\n\n43:41.720 --> 43:44.960\n and you could probably write 10, 20, 30 ways\n\n43:44.960 --> 43:46.640\n of asking about that topic\n\n43:46.640 --> 43:48.220\n and there will be all different.\n\n43:48.220 --> 43:50.200\n I don't know if there should be one page\n\n43:50.200 --> 43:51.880\n that answers all of it.\n\n43:51.880 --> 43:56.880\n Is there a way that Stack Overflow can help disambiguate,\n\n43:56.880 --> 44:01.160\n like separate these duplicate questions\n\n44:01.160 --> 44:02.820\n or connect them together?\n\n44:02.820 --> 44:06.220\n Or is it a totally hopeless, difficult, impossible task?\n\n44:06.220 --> 44:08.480\n I think it's a very, very hard computer science problem.\n\n44:08.480 --> 44:10.280\n And partly because people are very good\n\n44:10.280 --> 44:11.760\n at using completely different words.\n\n44:11.760 --> 44:13.160\n It always amazed me on Stack Overflow.\n\n44:13.160 --> 44:15.440\n You'd have two questions that were functionally identical\n\n44:15.440 --> 44:17.520\n and one question had like zero words in common\n\n44:17.520 --> 44:18.360\n with the other question.\n\n44:18.360 --> 44:20.920\n Like, oh my God, from a computer science perspective,\n\n44:20.920 --> 44:22.960\n how do you even begin to solve that?\n\n44:22.960 --> 44:24.480\n And it happens all the time.\n\n44:24.480 --> 44:26.280\n People are super good at this, right?\n\n44:26.280 --> 44:28.360\n Accidentally at asking the same thing\n\n44:28.360 --> 44:31.200\n in like 10, 20 different ways.\n\n44:31.200 --> 44:32.760\n And the other complexity is we want some\n\n44:32.760 --> 44:33.900\n of those duplicates to exist\n\n44:33.900 --> 44:36.000\n because if there's five versions with different words,\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.280\n have those five versions point\n\n44:37.280 --> 44:39.560\n to the one centralized answer, right?\n\n44:39.560 --> 44:41.880\n It's like, okay, this is a duplicate, no worries.\n\n44:41.880 --> 44:43.460\n Here's the answer that you wanted over here\n\n44:43.460 --> 44:48.000\n on the prime example that we want to have,\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.680\n rather than having 10 copies of the question and the answer.\n\n44:50.680 --> 44:52.400\n Because if you have 10 copies of the question and answer,\n\n44:52.400 --> 44:54.120\n this also devalues the reputation system,\n\n44:54.120 --> 44:56.880\n which programmers hate, as I previously mentioned.\n\n44:56.880 --> 44:58.320\n You're getting reputation for an answer\n\n44:58.320 --> 44:59.320\n that somebody else already gave.\n\n44:59.320 --> 45:00.440\n It's like, well, it's an answer,\n\n45:00.440 --> 45:02.200\n but somebody else already gave that answer.\n\n45:02.200 --> 45:04.560\n So why are you getting reputation for the same answer\n\n45:04.560 --> 45:06.480\n as the other guy who gave it four years ago?\n\n45:06.480 --> 45:07.760\n People get offended by that, right?\n\n45:07.760 --> 45:11.920\n So the reputation system itself adds tension to the system\n\n45:11.920 --> 45:14.040\n in that the people who have a lot of reputation\n\n45:14.040 --> 45:17.600\n become very incentivized to enforce the reputation system.\n\n45:17.600 --> 45:18.920\n And for the most part, that's good.\n\n45:18.920 --> 45:20.520\n I know it sounds weird, but for most parts,\n\n45:20.520 --> 45:23.880\n like look, strict systems, I think to use Stack Overflow,\n\n45:23.880 --> 45:26.000\n you have to have the idea that, OK, strict systems ultimately\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:26.720\n work better.\n\n45:26.720 --> 45:28.440\n And I do think in programming, you're\n\n45:28.440 --> 45:31.320\n familiar with loose typing versus strict typing, right?\n\n45:31.320 --> 45:33.000\n The idea that you can declare a variable,\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:34.840\n not declare a variable, rather, just start using a variable.\n\n45:34.840 --> 45:36.280\n And OK, I see it's implicitly an integer.\n\n45:36.280 --> 45:37.200\n Bam, awesome.\n\n45:37.200 --> 45:38.120\n Duck equals 5.\n\n45:38.120 --> 45:40.360\n Well, duck is now an integer of 5, right?\n\n45:40.360 --> 45:42.320\n And you're like, cool, awesome, simpler, right?\n\n45:42.320 --> 45:43.840\n Why would I want to worry about typing?\n\n45:43.840 --> 45:45.800\n And for a long time, in the Ruby community,\n\n45:45.800 --> 45:46.920\n they're like, yeah, this is awesome.\n\n45:46.920 --> 45:48.320\n You just do a bunch of unit testing,\n\n45:48.320 --> 45:50.960\n which is testing your program's validity after the fact\n\n45:50.960 --> 45:54.160\n to catch any bugs that strict typing of variables\n\n45:54.160 --> 45:55.040\n would have caught.\n\n45:55.040 --> 45:56.080\n And now you have this thing called\n\n45:56.080 --> 45:58.080\n TypeScript for Microsoft from the guy who\n\n45:58.080 --> 46:01.120\n built C Sharp Anders, who's one of the greatest\n\n46:01.120 --> 46:02.840\n minds in software development, right,\n\n46:02.840 --> 46:04.480\n like in terms of language design.\n\n46:04.480 --> 46:06.560\n And says, no, no, no, we want to bolt on a strict type\n\n46:06.560 --> 46:08.200\n system to JavaScript because it makes things better.\n\n46:08.200 --> 46:11.480\n And now everybody's like, oh my god, we deployed TypeScript\n\n46:11.480 --> 46:14.480\n and found 50 latent bugs that we didn't know about, right?\n\n46:14.480 --> 46:15.840\n Like, this is super common.\n\n46:15.840 --> 46:19.960\n So I think there is a truth in programming\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:22.280\n that strictness, it's not the goal.\n\n46:22.280 --> 46:25.720\n We're not saying be super strict because strictness is correct.\n\n46:25.720 --> 46:26.600\n No, it's no, no.\n\n46:26.600 --> 46:28.640\n Strictness produces better results.\n\n46:28.640 --> 46:29.880\n That's what I'm saying, right?\n\n46:29.880 --> 46:32.000\n So strict typing of variables, I would\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:33.920\n say you almost universally have consensus now\n\n46:33.920 --> 46:35.440\n is basically correct.\n\n46:35.440 --> 46:37.720\n Should be that way in every language, right?\n\n46:37.720 --> 46:39.480\n Duck equals five should generate an error\n\n46:39.480 --> 46:40.720\n because no, you didn't declare.\n\n46:40.720 --> 46:42.960\n You didn't tell me that duck was an integer, right?\n\n46:42.960 --> 46:43.840\n That's a bug, right?\n\n46:43.840 --> 46:44.720\n Or maybe you mistyped.\n\n46:44.720 --> 46:46.480\n You typed deck instead of duck, right?\n\n46:46.480 --> 46:47.120\n You never know.\n\n46:47.120 --> 46:48.840\n This happens all the time, right?\n\n46:48.840 --> 46:51.600\n So with that in mind, I will say that the strictness\n\n46:51.600 --> 46:52.720\n of the system is correct.\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:53.960\n Now, that doesn't mean cruel.\n\n46:53.960 --> 46:55.040\n That doesn't mean mean.\n\n46:55.040 --> 46:56.080\n That doesn't mean angry.\n\n46:56.080 --> 46:57.560\n It just means strict, OK?\n\n46:57.560 --> 46:59.280\n So I think where there's misunderstanding\n\n46:59.280 --> 47:00.720\n is people get cranky, right?\n\n47:00.720 --> 47:03.920\n Like, another question you asked is like, why are programmers\n\n47:03.920 --> 47:05.160\n kind of mean sometimes?\n\n47:05.160 --> 47:07.480\n Well, who do programmers work with all day long?\n\n47:07.480 --> 47:10.080\n So I have a theory that if you're at a job\n\n47:10.080 --> 47:12.440\n and you work with assholes all day long,\n\n47:12.440 --> 47:14.400\n what do you eventually become?\n\n47:14.400 --> 47:15.000\n An asshole.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:15.800\n An asshole.\n\n47:15.800 --> 47:19.280\n And what is the computer except the world's biggest asshole?\n\n47:19.280 --> 47:21.800\n Because the computer has no time for your bullshit.\n\n47:21.800 --> 47:24.040\n The computer, the minute you make a mistake,\n\n47:24.040 --> 47:25.480\n everything is crashing down, right?\n\n47:25.480 --> 47:28.160\n One semicolon has crashed space missions, right?\n\n47:28.160 --> 47:29.040\n So that's normal.\n\n47:29.040 --> 47:30.640\n So you begin to internalize that.\n\n47:30.640 --> 47:34.640\n You begin to think, oh, my coworker, the computer,\n\n47:34.640 --> 47:37.520\n is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything.\n\n47:37.520 --> 47:40.000\n So that's kind of how I'm going to be.\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:41.840\n Because I work with this computer,\n\n47:41.840 --> 47:44.600\n and I have to exceed to its terms on everything.\n\n47:44.600 --> 47:46.400\n So therefore, you start to absorb that.\n\n47:46.400 --> 47:49.400\n You start to think, oh, well, being really strict arbitrarily\n\n47:49.400 --> 47:50.440\n is really good.\n\n47:50.440 --> 47:54.120\n An error of error code 56249 is a completely good error message\n\n47:54.120 --> 47:56.120\n because that's what the computer gave me, right?\n\n47:56.120 --> 47:59.440\n So you kind of forget to be a person at some level.\n\n47:59.440 --> 48:02.200\n And you know how they say great detectives internalize\n\n48:02.200 --> 48:04.200\n criminals and kind of are criminals themselves,\n\n48:04.200 --> 48:06.700\n like this trope of the master detective\n\n48:06.700 --> 48:08.720\n is good because he can think like the criminal.\n\n48:08.720 --> 48:10.520\n Well, I do think that's true of programmers.\n\n48:10.520 --> 48:12.720\n Really good programmers think like the computer\n\n48:12.720 --> 48:14.200\n because that's their job.\n\n48:14.200 --> 48:17.080\n But if you internalize it too much, you become the computer.\n\n48:17.080 --> 48:19.560\n You kind of become a jerk to everybody\n\n48:19.560 --> 48:21.720\n because that's what you've internalized.\n\n48:21.720 --> 48:24.240\n You're almost not a jerk, but you have no patience\n\n48:24.240 --> 48:26.240\n for a lack of strictness, as you said.\n\n48:26.240 --> 48:27.840\n It's not out of a sense of meanness.\n\n48:27.840 --> 48:28.640\n It's accidental.\n\n48:28.640 --> 48:30.400\n But I do believe it's an occupational hazard\n\n48:30.400 --> 48:32.000\n of being a programmer is you start\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:33.760\n to behave like the computer.\n\n48:33.760 --> 48:34.800\n You're very unforgiving.\n\n48:34.800 --> 48:35.920\n You're very terse.\n\n48:35.920 --> 48:38.400\n You're very, oh, wrong, incorrect, move on.\n\n48:38.400 --> 48:40.040\n It's like, well, can you help me?\n\n48:40.040 --> 48:41.240\n What could I do to fix?\n\n48:41.240 --> 48:44.000\n No, wrong, next question.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.440\n Like, that's normal for the computer.\n\n48:46.440 --> 48:49.280\n Just fail, next.\n\n48:49.280 --> 48:51.600\n I don't know if you remember in Saturday Night Live,\n\n48:51.600 --> 48:54.640\n in the 90s, they had this character who was an IT guy.\n\n48:54.640 --> 48:55.520\n The move guy.\n\n48:55.520 --> 48:56.040\n Move.\n\n48:56.040 --> 48:56.720\n Move.\n\n48:56.720 --> 48:58.080\n Was that Jimmy Fallon?\n\n48:58.080 --> 48:58.640\n No.\n\n48:58.640 --> 48:59.760\n No.\n\n48:59.760 --> 49:01.160\n Who played him?\n\n49:01.160 --> 49:02.120\n OK, yeah, I remember.\n\n49:02.120 --> 49:02.620\n Move.\n\n49:02.620 --> 49:03.120\n Right.\n\n49:03.120 --> 49:04.160\n He had no patience for it.\n\n49:04.160 --> 49:05.720\n Might have been Mad TV, actually.\n\n49:05.720 --> 49:06.680\n Wasn't it Mad TV?\n\n49:06.680 --> 49:07.600\n Might have been.\n\n49:07.600 --> 49:10.940\n But anyway, that's always been the perception.\n\n49:10.940 --> 49:12.560\n You start to behave like the computer.\n\n49:12.560 --> 49:14.880\n It's like, oh, you're wrong, out of the way, you know?\n\n49:14.880 --> 49:17.560\n You've written so many blog posts about programming,\n\n49:17.560 --> 49:22.720\n about programs, programming, programmers.\n\n49:22.720 --> 49:26.920\n What do you think makes a good, let's start with,\n\n49:26.920 --> 49:29.360\n what makes a good solo programmer?\n\n49:29.360 --> 49:31.600\n Well, I don't think you should be a solo programmer.\n\n49:31.600 --> 49:33.400\n I think to be a good solo programmer,\n\n49:33.400 --> 49:35.800\n it's kind of like what I talked about, well, not on Mike,\n\n49:35.800 --> 49:39.240\n but one of the things John Carmack, one of the best\n\n49:39.240 --> 49:41.120\n points he makes in the book Masters of Doom, which\n\n49:41.120 --> 49:43.200\n is a fantastic book, and anybody listening to this\n\n49:43.200 --> 49:44.700\n who hasn't read it, please read it.\n\n49:44.700 --> 49:47.400\n It's such a great book, is that at the time,\n\n49:47.400 --> 49:50.720\n they were working on stuff like Wolfenstein and Doom.\n\n49:50.720 --> 49:52.780\n They didn't have the resources that we have today.\n\n49:52.780 --> 49:53.940\n They didn't have Stack Overflow.\n\n49:53.940 --> 49:54.860\n They didn't have Wikipedia.\n\n49:54.860 --> 49:56.680\n They didn't have discourse forums.\n\n49:56.680 --> 50:00.200\n They didn't have places to go to get people to help them.\n\n50:00.200 --> 50:01.880\n They had to work on their own.\n\n50:01.880 --> 50:03.760\n And that's why it took a genius like Carmack\n\n50:03.760 --> 50:05.120\n to do this stuff, because you had\n\n50:05.120 --> 50:07.160\n to be a genius to invent from first principles.\n\n50:07.160 --> 50:09.560\n A lot of the stuff he was like, the hacks he was coming up\n\n50:09.560 --> 50:11.900\n with were genius, genius level stuff.\n\n50:11.900 --> 50:13.880\n But you don't need to be a genius anymore,\n\n50:13.880 --> 50:15.540\n and that means not working by yourself.\n\n50:15.540 --> 50:17.420\n You have to be good at researching stuff online.\n\n50:17.420 --> 50:19.680\n You have to be good at asking questions, really good\n\n50:19.680 --> 50:21.440\n questions that are really well researched, which implies,\n\n50:21.440 --> 50:23.080\n oh, I went out and researched for three hours\n\n50:23.080 --> 50:24.240\n before I wrote these questions.\n\n50:24.240 --> 50:26.200\n That's what you should be doing, because that's\n\n50:26.200 --> 50:28.160\n what's going to make you good.\n\n50:28.160 --> 50:29.360\n To me, this is the big difference\n\n50:29.360 --> 50:32.120\n between programming in the 80s versus programming today,\n\n50:32.120 --> 50:35.040\n is you kind of had to be by yourself back then.\n\n50:35.040 --> 50:36.560\n Where would you go for answers?\n\n50:36.560 --> 50:38.060\n I remember in the early days when\n\n50:38.060 --> 50:41.320\n I was learning Visual Basic for Windows,\n\n50:41.320 --> 50:44.600\n I would call the Microsoft Helpline on the phone\n\n50:44.600 --> 50:45.680\n when I had programming.\n\n50:45.680 --> 50:47.040\n Because I was like, I don't know what to do.\n\n50:47.040 --> 50:49.640\n So I would go and call, and they had these huge phone banks.\n\n50:49.640 --> 50:51.480\n And I'm like, can you imagine how alien that is now?\n\n50:51.480 --> 50:52.480\n Who would do that?\n\n50:52.480 --> 50:53.560\n That's crazy.\n\n50:53.560 --> 50:57.720\n So there was just nowhere else to go when you got stuck.\n\n50:57.720 --> 50:59.560\n I had the books that came with it.\n\n50:59.560 --> 51:01.320\n I read those, studied those religiously.\n\n51:01.320 --> 51:03.320\n I just saw a post from Steve Sanofsky\n\n51:03.320 --> 51:08.880\n that said the C++ version 7 came with 10,000 pages\n\n51:08.880 --> 51:10.640\n of written material.\n\n51:10.640 --> 51:13.600\n Because where else were you going to figure that stuff out?\n\n51:13.600 --> 51:14.640\n Go to the library?\n\n51:14.640 --> 51:16.100\n I mean, you didn't have Wikipedia.\n\n51:16.100 --> 51:17.880\n You didn't have Reddit.\n\n51:17.880 --> 51:20.760\n You didn't have anywhere to go to answer these questions.\n\n51:20.760 --> 51:24.160\n So you've talked about, through the years,\n\n51:24.160 --> 51:26.200\n basically not having an ego and not\n\n51:26.200 --> 51:29.920\n thinking that you're the best programmer in the world.\n\n51:29.920 --> 51:34.040\n So always kind of just looking to improve,\n\n51:34.040 --> 51:36.520\n to become a better programmer than you were yesterday.\n\n51:36.520 --> 51:39.160\n So how have you changed as a programmer\n\n51:39.160 --> 51:43.280\n and as a thinker, designer around programming\n\n51:43.280 --> 51:47.600\n over the past, what is it, 15 years, really,\n\n51:47.600 --> 51:48.960\n of being a public figure?\n\n51:48.960 --> 51:51.960\n I would say the big insight that I had is, eventually,\n\n51:51.960 --> 51:54.000\n as a programmer, you have to stop writing code\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.880\n to be effective, which is kind of disturbing.\n\n51:56.880 --> 51:58.240\n Because you really love it.\n\n51:58.240 --> 52:01.600\n But you realize being effective at programming,\n\n52:01.600 --> 52:03.960\n at programming in the general sense,\n\n52:03.960 --> 52:05.120\n doesn't mean writing code.\n\n52:05.120 --> 52:07.000\n And a lot of times, you can be much more successful by not\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.840\n writing code and writing code in terms of just solving\n\n52:09.840 --> 52:11.680\n the problems you have, essentially hiring people\n\n52:11.680 --> 52:13.780\n that are really good and setting them free\n\n52:13.780 --> 52:18.000\n and giving them basic direction on strategy and stuff.\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:19.680\n Because a lot of the problems you encounter\n\n52:19.680 --> 52:22.360\n aren't necessarily solved through really gnarly code.\n\n52:22.360 --> 52:25.720\n They're solved by conceptual solutions, which can then\n\n52:25.720 --> 52:26.520\n be turned into code.\n\n52:26.520 --> 52:29.720\n But are you even solving the right problem?\n\n52:29.720 --> 52:32.880\n So I would say, for me, the main insight I have\n\n52:32.880 --> 52:36.080\n is, to succeed as a programmer, you eventually\n\n52:36.080 --> 52:37.560\n kind of stop writing code.\n\n52:37.560 --> 52:39.160\n That's going to sound discouraging, probably,\n\n52:39.160 --> 52:39.680\n to people hearing.\n\n52:39.680 --> 52:40.760\n But I don't mean it that way.\n\n52:40.760 --> 52:42.120\n What I mean is that you're coding\n\n52:42.120 --> 52:43.360\n at a higher level language.\n\n52:43.360 --> 52:45.600\n Eventually, like, OK, so we're coding in assembly language.\n\n52:45.600 --> 52:46.800\n That's the beginning, right?\n\n52:46.800 --> 52:48.960\n You're hardcoded to the architecture.\n\n52:48.960 --> 52:50.280\n Then you have stuff like C, where it's like, wow,\n\n52:50.280 --> 52:52.080\n we can abstract across the architecture.\n\n52:52.080 --> 52:52.880\n We can write code.\n\n52:52.880 --> 52:54.640\n I can then compile that code for ARM\n\n52:54.640 --> 52:58.400\n or whatever x86 or whatever else is out there.\n\n52:58.400 --> 53:00.600\n And then even higher level than that,\n\n53:00.600 --> 53:03.160\n you're looking at Python, Ruby, interpreted languages.\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:04.680\n And then, to me, as a programmer,\n\n53:04.680 --> 53:06.000\n I'm like, OK, I want to go even higher.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:07.200\n I want to go higher than that.\n\n53:07.200 --> 53:08.560\n How do I abstract higher than the language?\n\n53:08.560 --> 53:11.120\n It's like, well, you abstract in spoken language\n\n53:11.120 --> 53:12.560\n and written language, right?\n\n53:12.560 --> 53:14.640\n You're sort of inspiring people to get things done,\n\n53:14.640 --> 53:16.080\n giving them guidance, like, what if we did this?\n\n53:16.080 --> 53:17.240\n What if we did this?\n\n53:17.240 --> 53:19.120\n You're writing in the highest level language\n\n53:19.120 --> 53:21.360\n that there is, which is, for me, English,\n\n53:21.360 --> 53:23.120\n whatever your spoken language is.\n\n53:23.120 --> 53:25.960\n So it's all about being effective, right?\n\n53:25.960 --> 53:31.000\n And I think Patrick McKenzie, patio11 on Hacker News\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.600\n and works at Stripe, has a great post about this,\n\n53:33.600 --> 53:35.880\n of how calling yourself a programmer\n\n53:35.880 --> 53:38.160\n is a career limiting move at some level\n\n53:38.160 --> 53:39.800\n once you get far enough from your career.\n\n53:39.800 --> 53:40.800\n And I really believe that.\n\n53:40.800 --> 53:41.840\n And again, I apologize.\n\n53:41.840 --> 53:43.080\n This is sound discouraging.\n\n53:43.080 --> 53:45.240\n I don't mean it to be, but he's so right.\n\n53:45.240 --> 53:47.720\n Because all the stuff that goes on around the code,\n\n53:47.720 --> 53:49.760\n like the people, that's another thing,\n\n53:49.760 --> 53:52.200\n if you look at my early blog entries, is about, wow,\n\n53:52.200 --> 53:54.720\n programming is about people more than it's\n\n53:54.720 --> 53:56.680\n about code, which doesn't really make sense.\n\n53:56.680 --> 53:59.160\n But it's about, can these people even get along together?\n\n53:59.160 --> 54:00.720\n Can they understand each other?\n\n54:00.720 --> 54:03.000\n Can you even explain to me what it is you're working on?\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:04.560\n Are you solving the right problem?\n\n54:04.560 --> 54:06.600\n PeopleWare, another classic programming book,\n\n54:06.600 --> 54:08.480\n which, again, up there with Code Complete,\n\n54:08.480 --> 54:09.960\n please read PeopleWare.\n\n54:09.960 --> 54:11.560\n It's that software is people.\n\n54:11.560 --> 54:13.440\n People are the software, first and foremost.\n\n54:13.440 --> 54:15.860\n So a lot of the skills that I was working on early\n\n54:15.860 --> 54:18.560\n in the blog were about figuring out the people\n\n54:18.560 --> 54:20.680\n parts of programming, which were the harder parts.\n\n54:20.680 --> 54:21.880\n The hard part of programming, once you\n\n54:21.880 --> 54:23.040\n get a certain skill level in programming,\n\n54:23.040 --> 54:25.360\n you can pretty much solve any reasonable problem that's\n\n54:25.360 --> 54:26.320\n put in front of you.\n\n54:26.320 --> 54:28.120\n You're not writing algorithms from scratch.\n\n54:28.120 --> 54:29.280\n That just doesn't happen.\n\n54:29.280 --> 54:31.360\n So any sort of reasonable problem put in front of you,\n\n54:31.360 --> 54:32.760\n you're going to be able to solve.\n\n54:32.760 --> 54:36.920\n But what you can't solve is, our manager is a total jerk.\n\n54:36.920 --> 54:38.600\n You cannot solve that with code.\n\n54:38.600 --> 54:40.800\n That is not a code solvable problem.\n\n54:40.800 --> 54:44.040\n And yet, that will cripple you way more than, oh, we\n\n54:44.040 --> 54:45.800\n had to use this stupid framework I don't like,\n\n54:45.800 --> 54:49.320\n or Sam keeps writing bad code that I hate,\n\n54:49.320 --> 54:52.440\n or Dave is off there in the wilderness writing\n\n54:52.440 --> 54:53.280\n God knows what.\n\n54:53.280 --> 54:54.440\n These are not your problems.\n\n54:54.440 --> 54:56.800\n Your problem is your manager or a co worker\n\n54:56.800 --> 54:58.760\n is so toxic to everybody else in your team\n\n54:58.760 --> 55:00.080\n that nobody can get anything done,\n\n55:00.080 --> 55:02.320\n because everybody's so stressed out and freaked out.\n\n55:02.320 --> 55:04.520\n These are the problems that you have to attack.\n\n55:04.520 --> 55:05.040\n Absolutely.\n\n55:05.040 --> 55:07.360\n And so as you go to these higher level abstractions,\n\n55:07.360 --> 55:09.060\n as you've developed as a programmer\n\n55:09.060 --> 55:10.600\n to higher and higher level abstractions\n\n55:10.600 --> 55:12.680\n and go into natural language, you're\n\n55:12.680 --> 55:17.560\n also the guy who preached building it, diving in\n\n55:17.560 --> 55:21.720\n and doing it, and learn by doing.\n\n55:21.720 --> 55:22.840\n Yes.\n\n55:22.840 --> 55:29.120\n Do you worry that as you get to higher and higher level\n\n55:29.120 --> 55:34.320\n abstractions, you lose track of the lower level of just\n\n55:34.320 --> 55:35.880\n building?\n\n55:35.880 --> 55:38.560\n Do you worry about that, even not maybe now,\n\n55:38.560 --> 55:41.560\n but 10 years from now, 20 years from now?\n\n55:41.560 --> 55:42.480\n Well, no.\n\n55:42.480 --> 55:44.360\n I mean, there is always that paranoia around, oh, gosh,\n\n55:44.360 --> 55:46.240\n I don't feel it's valuable since I'm not writing code.\n\n55:46.240 --> 55:48.280\n But for me, when we started the discourse project,\n\n55:48.280 --> 55:50.280\n it was Ruby, which I didn't really know Ruby.\n\n55:50.280 --> 55:51.840\n I mean, as you pointed out, and this\n\n55:51.840 --> 55:53.840\n is another valuable observation in Stack Overflow,\n\n55:53.840 --> 55:56.040\n you can be super proficient in, for example, C Sharp,\n\n55:56.040 --> 55:56.760\n which I was working in.\n\n55:56.760 --> 55:58.400\n That's what we built Stack Overflow in and still\n\n55:58.400 --> 55:59.360\n is written in.\n\n55:59.360 --> 56:01.920\n And then switch to Ruby, and you're a newbie again.\n\n56:01.920 --> 56:03.240\n But you have the framework.\n\n56:03.240 --> 56:04.440\n I know what a for loop is.\n\n56:04.440 --> 56:05.800\n I know what recursion is.\n\n56:05.800 --> 56:10.040\n I know what a stack trace is.\n\n56:10.040 --> 56:12.040\n I have all the fundamental concepts to be a programmer.\n\n56:12.040 --> 56:13.040\n I just don't know Ruby.\n\n56:13.040 --> 56:14.800\n So I'm still on a higher level.\n\n56:14.800 --> 56:16.600\n I'm not like a beginner beginner, like you're saying.\n\n56:16.600 --> 56:19.140\n I'm just like, I need to apply my programming concepts I already\n\n56:19.140 --> 56:20.360\n know to Ruby.\n\n56:20.360 --> 56:23.280\n Well, so there's a question that's really interesting.\n\n56:23.280 --> 56:26.840\n So looking at Ruby, how do you go about learning enough\n\n56:26.840 --> 56:29.640\n that your intuition can be applied, carried over?\n\n56:29.640 --> 56:30.360\n That's what I was trying to get to.\n\n56:30.360 --> 56:31.600\n It's like what I realized, particularly when I started\n\n56:31.600 --> 56:34.840\n with just me and Robin, I realized if I bother Robin,\n\n56:34.840 --> 56:37.120\n I am now costing us productivity.\n\n56:37.120 --> 56:42.160\n Every time I go to Robin, rather than building our first alpha\n\n56:42.160 --> 56:45.540\n version of discourse, he's now answering my stupid questions\n\n56:45.540 --> 56:46.040\n about Ruby.\n\n56:46.040 --> 56:47.600\n Is that a good use of his time?\n\n56:47.600 --> 56:49.160\n Is that a good use of my time?\n\n56:49.160 --> 56:53.080\n And the answer to both of those was resoundingly no.\n\n56:53.080 --> 56:55.080\n We were getting to an alpha, and it was pretty much just,\n\n56:55.080 --> 56:56.880\n OK, we'll hire more programmers.\n\n56:56.880 --> 57:00.240\n We eventually hired Neil, and then eventually Sam,\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:02.920\n who came in as a cofounder.\n\n57:02.920 --> 57:05.000\n Actually, it was Sam first, then Neil later.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:06.400\n But the answer to the problem is just\n\n57:06.400 --> 57:08.200\n hire other competent programmers.\n\n57:08.200 --> 57:11.080\n Now I shall pull myself up by my bootstraps\n\n57:11.080 --> 57:12.320\n and learn Ruby.\n\n57:12.320 --> 57:15.960\n But at some point, writing code becomes a liability to you\n\n57:15.960 --> 57:17.360\n in terms of getting things done.\n\n57:17.360 --> 57:18.460\n There's so many other things that\n\n57:18.460 --> 57:20.800\n go on in the project, like building the prototype.\n\n57:20.800 --> 57:23.120\n You mentioned, well, how do you, if you're not writing code,\n\n57:23.120 --> 57:25.680\n how does everybody keep focus on what are we building?\n\n57:25.680 --> 57:28.440\n Well, first, basic mockups and research.\n\n57:28.440 --> 57:30.160\n What do we even want to build?\n\n57:30.160 --> 57:31.240\n There's a little bit of that that goes on.\n\n57:31.240 --> 57:32.800\n But then very quickly, you get to the prototype stage.\n\n57:32.800 --> 57:33.760\n Like, build a prototype.\n\n57:33.760 --> 57:35.920\n Let's iterate on the prototype really, really rapidly.\n\n57:35.920 --> 57:36.840\n And that's what we do with discourse.\n\n57:36.840 --> 57:38.960\n And that's what we demoed to get our seed funding\n\n57:38.960 --> 57:42.320\n for discourse was the alpha version of discourse\n\n57:42.320 --> 57:43.800\n that we had running and ready to go.\n\n57:43.800 --> 57:45.160\n And it was very, it was bad.\n\n57:45.160 --> 57:47.360\n I mean, it was, I'll just tell you it was bad.\n\n57:47.360 --> 57:48.440\n We have screenshots of it.\n\n57:48.440 --> 57:50.280\n I'm just embarrassed to look at it now.\n\n57:50.280 --> 57:51.320\n But it was the prototype.\n\n57:51.320 --> 57:53.740\n We were figuring out what's working, what's not working.\n\n57:53.740 --> 57:58.040\n Because there's such a broad gap between the way\n\n57:58.040 --> 58:00.400\n you think things will work in your mind or even on paper\n\n58:00.400 --> 58:03.040\n and the way they work once you sit and live in the software,\n\n58:03.040 --> 58:05.560\n like actually spend time living and breathing in software,\n\n58:05.560 --> 58:06.720\n so different.\n\n58:06.720 --> 58:10.800\n So my philosophy is get to a prototype.\n\n58:10.800 --> 58:12.380\n And then what you're really optimizing\n\n58:12.380 --> 58:14.800\n for is speed of iteration, like how you can turn the crank.\n\n58:14.800 --> 58:16.120\n How quickly can we iterate?\n\n58:16.120 --> 58:18.000\n That's the absolutely critical metric\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:19.160\n of any software project.\n\n58:19.160 --> 58:20.920\n And I had a tweet recently that people liked.\n\n58:20.920 --> 58:23.160\n And I totally, this is so fundamental to what I do,\n\n58:23.160 --> 58:26.160\n is like if you want to measure the core competency of any\n\n58:26.160 --> 58:28.960\n software tech company, it's the speed at which somebody\n\n58:28.960 --> 58:31.200\n can say, hey, we really need this word in the product.\n\n58:31.200 --> 58:32.280\n Change this word, right?\n\n58:32.280 --> 58:34.280\n Because it will be more clear to the user.\n\n58:34.280 --> 58:36.400\n Like, instead of respond, it's reply or something.\n\n58:36.400 --> 58:39.760\n But there's some, from the conception of that idea\n\n58:39.760 --> 58:42.640\n to how quickly that single word can be changed in your software\n\n58:42.640 --> 58:44.920\n and rolled out to users, that is your life cycle.\n\n58:44.920 --> 58:47.320\n That's your health, your heartbeat.\n\n58:47.320 --> 58:51.640\n If your heartbeat is like super slow, you're basically dead.\n\n58:51.640 --> 58:52.200\n No, seriously.\n\n58:52.200 --> 58:54.880\n Like, if it takes two weeks or even a month\n\n58:54.880 --> 58:56.840\n to get that single word changed, everybody's like, oh my god,\n\n58:56.840 --> 58:57.760\n this is a great idea.\n\n58:57.760 --> 58:59.000\n That word is so much clearer.\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:00.700\n I'm talking about like a super, like everybody's\n\n59:00.700 --> 59:01.660\n on board for this change.\n\n59:01.660 --> 59:03.500\n It's not like, let's just change a word because we're bored.\n\n59:03.500 --> 59:05.600\n It's like, this is an awesome change.\n\n59:05.600 --> 59:07.000\n And then it takes months to roll out.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:08.120\n It's like, well, you're dead.\n\n59:08.120 --> 59:09.200\n You can't iterate.\n\n59:09.200 --> 59:12.360\n You can't, how are you going to do anything, right?\n\n59:12.360 --> 59:13.800\n So anyway, about the heartbeat, it's\n\n59:13.800 --> 59:15.960\n like, get the prototype and then iterate on it.\n\n59:15.960 --> 59:19.880\n That's what I view as the central tenet of modern software\n\n59:19.880 --> 59:20.480\n development.\n\n59:20.480 --> 59:22.480\n That's fascinating that you put it that way.\n\n59:22.480 --> 59:24.440\n So I work and I build autonomous vehicles.\n\n59:24.440 --> 59:28.160\n And when you look at what, maybe compare Tesla\n\n59:28.160 --> 59:34.120\n to most other automakers, the heart beat for Tesla\n\n59:34.120 --> 59:38.120\n is literally days now in terms of they can over the air\n\n59:38.120 --> 59:41.360\n deploy software updates to all their vehicles, which\n\n59:41.360 --> 59:46.040\n is markedly different than every other automaker, which takes\n\n59:46.040 --> 59:49.160\n years to update a piece of software.\n\n59:49.160 --> 59:52.120\n And that's reflected in everything\n\n59:52.120 --> 59:54.840\n that's the final product.\n\n59:54.840 --> 59:57.280\n That's reflected in really how slowly they\n\n59:57.280 --> 59:58.200\n adapt to the times.\n\n59:58.200 --> 59:59.900\n And to be clear, I'm not saying being a hummingbird\n\n59:59.900 --> 1:00:00.680\n is the goal either.\n\n1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:02.400\n It's like, you don't want a heartbeat that's like so fast.\n\n1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:04.440\n It's like you're just freaking out.\n\n1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:05.720\n But it is a measure of health.\n\n1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:07.320\n You should have a healthy heartbeat.\n\n1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:09.560\n It's up to people listening to decide what that means.\n\n1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:10.880\n But it has to be healthy.\n\n1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:11.680\n It has to be reasonable.\n\n1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:12.840\n Because otherwise, you're just going\n\n1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:15.140\n to be frustrated because that's how you build software.\n\n1:00:15.140 --> 1:00:15.940\n You make mistakes.\n\n1:00:15.940 --> 1:00:16.600\n You roll it out.\n\n1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:17.760\n You live with it.\n\n1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:19.160\n You see what it feels like and say, oh, God,\n\n1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:20.160\n that was a terrible idea.\n\n1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:22.720\n Oh, my gosh, this could be even better if we did Y, right?\n\n1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:23.480\n You turn the crank.\n\n1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:25.920\n And then the more you do that, the faster\n\n1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:28.640\n you get ahead of your competitors ultimately.\n\n1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:29.680\n It's rate of change, right?\n\n1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:30.920\n Delta V, right?\n\n1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:32.660\n How fast are you moving?\n\n1:00:32.660 --> 1:00:34.760\n Well, within a year, you're going to be miles away\n\n1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:36.760\n by the time they catch up with you, right?\n\n1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:37.880\n That's the way it works.\n\n1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:40.800\n And plus, as a software developer and user,\n\n1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:42.800\n I love software that's constantly changing.\n\n1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:45.600\n Because I don't understand people who get super pissed off\n\n1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.180\n when like, oh, they changed the software on me.\n\n1:00:47.180 --> 1:00:47.720\n How dare they?\n\n1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:49.520\n I'm like, yes, change the software.\n\n1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:51.280\n Change it all the time, man.\n\n1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:52.720\n That's what makes this stuff great\n\n1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:55.320\n is that it can be changed so rapidly\n\n1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:58.120\n and become something that is greater than it is now.\n\n1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:00.040\n Now, granted, there are some changes that suck.\n\n1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:01.160\n I admit.\n\n1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:02.240\n I've seen it many times.\n\n1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:05.040\n But in general, that's what makes software cool, right?\n\n1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:06.640\n It's that it is so malleable.\n\n1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:08.440\n Fighting that is weird to me.\n\n1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:10.120\n Because it's like, well, you're fighting\n\n1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:12.200\n the essence of the thing that you're building.\n\n1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:13.000\n That doesn't make sense.\n\n1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.200\n You want to really embrace that.\n\n1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:16.280\n Not to be a hummingbird, but embrace it\n\n1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:18.200\n to a healthy cycle of your heartbeat, right?\n\n1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:21.040\n So you talk about that people really don't change.\n\n1:01:21.040 --> 1:01:22.520\n It's true.\n\n1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:25.720\n That's why probably a lot of the stuff you write about in your blog\n\n1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:27.200\n probably will remain true.\n\n1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:28.780\n Well, there's a flip side of the coin.\n\n1:01:28.780 --> 1:01:29.580\n People don't change.\n\n1:01:29.580 --> 1:01:31.640\n Like, investing and understanding people\n\n1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:34.840\n is like learning Unix in 1970.\n\n1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:36.960\n Because nothing has changed, right?\n\n1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.880\n All those things you've learned about people\n\n1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.680\n will still be valid 34 years from now.\n\n1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:43.180\n Whereas if you learn the latest JavaScript framework,\n\n1:01:43.180 --> 1:01:45.360\n that's going to be good for like two years, right?\n\n1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:46.720\n Exactly.\n\n1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:49.800\n But if you look at the future of programming,\n\n1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:52.980\n so there's a people component, but there's also\n\n1:01:52.980 --> 1:01:55.040\n the technology itself.\n\n1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:57.320\n What do you see as the future of programming?\n\n1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:01.840\n Will it change significantly, or as far as you can tell,\n\n1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:04.800\n people are ultimately programming,\n\n1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:08.720\n and so it's not something that you foresee changing\n\n1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:10.040\n in any fundamental way?\n\n1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:12.880\n Well, you've got to go look back on sort\n\n1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:14.440\n of the basics of programming.\n\n1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:15.520\n And one of things that always shocked me\n\n1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:16.400\n is like source control.\n\n1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.680\n Like, I didn't learn anything about source control.\n\n1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:22.400\n Granted, I graduated from college in 1992.\n\n1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:25.800\n But I remember hearing from people as late as like 1998,\n\n1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:27.760\n 1999, like even maybe today, they're\n\n1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:28.960\n not learning source control.\n\n1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.240\n And to me, it's like, well, how can you not\n\n1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:31.600\n learn source control?\n\n1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:34.320\n That is so fundamental to working with other programmers,\n\n1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:36.280\n working in a way that you don't lose your work.\n\n1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:39.720\n Just basic software, the literal bedrock of software\n\n1:02:39.720 --> 1:02:41.280\n development is source control.\n\n1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:42.840\n Now, you compare it today, like GitHub, right?\n\n1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:44.080\n Like Microsoft bought GitHub, which\n\n1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:46.000\n I think was an incredibly smart acquisition move\n\n1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.000\n on their part.\n\n1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.880\n Now they have anybody who wants reasonable source control\n\n1:02:49.880 --> 1:02:50.960\n to go sign up on GitHub.\n\n1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:52.440\n It's all set up for you, right?\n\n1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:55.360\n There's tons of walkthroughs, tons of tutorials.\n\n1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:57.320\n So from the concept of like, has programming\n\n1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:00.320\n advanced from, say, 1999, it's like, well, hell, we have GitHub.\n\n1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:01.600\n I mean, my god, yes, right?\n\n1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:04.880\n Like, it's massively advanced over what it was.\n\n1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:08.880\n Now, as to whether programming is significantly different,\n\n1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:09.720\n I'm going to say no.\n\n1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:14.560\n But I think the baseline of what we view as fundamentals\n\n1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:16.560\n will continue to go up and actually get better,\n\n1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:17.520\n like source control.\n\n1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:20.880\n That's one of the fundamentals that has gotten hundreds\n\n1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:23.800\n of orders of magnitude better than it was 10, 20 years ago.\n\n1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:25.000\n So those are the fundamentals.\n\n1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.320\n Let me introduce two things that maybe you can comment on.\n\n1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:31.080\n So one is mobile phones.\n\n1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:37.160\n So that could fundamentally transform what programming is,\n\n1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:38.000\n or maybe not.\n\n1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.320\n Maybe you can comment on that.\n\n1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:41.560\n And the other one is artificial intelligence,\n\n1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:46.560\n which promises to, in some ways, to do\n\n1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:49.600\n some of the programming for you is one way to think about it.\n\n1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:52.360\n So it's really what a programmer is,\n\n1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:55.720\n is using the intelligence that's inside your skull\n\n1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:57.880\n to do something useful.\n\n1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:59.520\n The hope with artificial intelligence\n\n1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:02.080\n is that it does some of the useful parts for you\n\n1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:03.720\n where you don't have to think about it.\n\n1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:07.720\n So do you see smartphones, the fact that everybody has one,\n\n1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:10.080\n and they're getting more and more powerful as potentially\n\n1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:11.640\n changing programming?\n\n1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:14.360\n And do you see AI as potentially changing programming?\n\n1:04:14.360 --> 1:04:15.640\n OK, so that's good.\n\n1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:17.560\n So smartphones have definitely changed.\n\n1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:20.020\n I mean, since, I guess, 2010 is when they really\n\n1:04:20.020 --> 1:04:21.840\n started getting super popular.\n\n1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:24.760\n I mean, in the last eight years, the world\n\n1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:25.920\n has literally changed, right?\n\n1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:28.520\n Everybody carries a computer around, and that's normal.\n\n1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:30.920\n I mean, that is such a huge change in society.\n\n1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:32.460\n I think we're still dealing with a lot\n\n1:04:32.460 --> 1:04:35.260\n of the positive and negative ramifications of that, right?\n\n1:04:35.260 --> 1:04:36.280\n Everybody's connected all the time.\n\n1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:37.980\n Everybody's on the computer all the time.\n\n1:04:37.980 --> 1:04:40.360\n That was my dream world as a geek, right?\n\n1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:42.560\n But it's like, be careful what you ask for, right?\n\n1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:44.200\n Like, wow, now everybody has a computer.\n\n1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:47.040\n It's not quite the utopia that we thought it would be, right?\n\n1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:49.720\n Computers can be used for a lot of stuff that's not necessarily\n\n1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:51.200\n great.\n\n1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:53.160\n So to me, that's the central focus of the smartphone,\n\n1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:55.720\n is just that it puts a computer in front of everyone.\n\n1:04:55.720 --> 1:04:57.800\n Granted, a small, touch screen, smallish,\n\n1:04:57.800 --> 1:04:59.080\n touch screen computer.\n\n1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:00.560\n But as for programming, I don't know.\n\n1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:03.080\n I don't think that I've kind of, over time,\n\n1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:05.360\n come to subscribe to the Unix view of the world\n\n1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:06.600\n when it comes to programming.\n\n1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:09.960\n You want to teach these basic command line things,\n\n1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:11.280\n and that is just what programming\n\n1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:14.440\n is going to be for, I think, a long, long time.\n\n1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:17.120\n I don't think there's any magical visual programming\n\n1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:20.160\n that's going to happen.\n\n1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:20.680\n I don't know.\n\n1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:23.180\n I've, over time, have become a believer in that Unix\n\n1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:25.120\n philosophy of just, you know, they kind of had\n\n1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:26.440\n to write with Unix.\n\n1:05:26.440 --> 1:05:28.960\n That's going to be the way it is for a long, long time.\n\n1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:31.640\n And we'll continue to, like I said, raise the baseline.\n\n1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:32.440\n The tools will get better.\n\n1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:33.020\n It'll get simpler.\n\n1:05:33.020 --> 1:05:34.440\n But it's still fundamentally going\n\n1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:37.200\n to be command line tools, fancy IDEs.\n\n1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.240\n That's kind of it for the foreseeable future.\n\n1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:41.440\n I'm not seeing any visual programming stuff\n\n1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:42.240\n on the horizon.\n\n1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:43.200\n Because you kind of think, like, what\n\n1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.200\n do you do on a smartphone that will be directly\n\n1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:46.480\n analogous to programming?\n\n1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:48.240\n Like, I'm trying to think, right?\n\n1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:52.200\n And there's really not much.\n\n1:05:52.200 --> 1:05:55.160\n So not necessarily analogous to programming,\n\n1:05:55.160 --> 1:06:01.680\n but the kind of things that, the kind of programs\n\n1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:07.360\n you would need to write might need to be very different.\n\n1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:08.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:08.040 --> 1:06:09.480\n And the kind of languages.\n\n1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:12.400\n I mean, but I probably also subscribe to the same,\n\n1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:14.260\n just because everything in this world\n\n1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:16.200\n might be written in JavaScript.\n\n1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:16.720\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:17.760\n That's already happening.\n\n1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:18.960\n I mean, discourse is a bet.\n\n1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:20.840\n Discourse itself, JavaScript, is another bet\n\n1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:21.920\n on that side of the table.\n\n1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:23.680\n And I still try and believe in that.\n\n1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.220\n So I would say smartphones have mostly a cultural shift more\n\n1:06:26.220 --> 1:06:27.720\n than a programming shift.\n\n1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:30.080\n Now, your other question was about artificial intelligence\n\n1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:32.760\n and sort of devices predicting what you're going to do.\n\n1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:34.640\n And I do think there's some strength to that.\n\n1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:37.040\n I think artificial intelligence is kind of overselling it\n\n1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:37.680\n in terms of what it's doing.\n\n1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:39.720\n It's more like, people are predictable, right?\n\n1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:41.120\n People do the same things.\n\n1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:43.120\n Let me give you an example.\n\n1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.720\n One check we put in a discourse that's\n\n1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:48.280\n been a lot of big commercial websites is,\n\n1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:51.160\n say you log in from New York City now.\n\n1:06:51.160 --> 1:06:54.200\n And then an hour later, you log in from San Francisco.\n\n1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:56.600\n It's like, well, hmm, that's interesting.\n\n1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:59.560\n How did you get from New York to San Francisco in one hour?\n\n1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:01.220\n So at that point, you're like, OK, this\n\n1:07:01.220 --> 1:07:02.680\n is a suspicious login at that point.\n\n1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:03.520\n So we would alert you.\n\n1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:04.200\n It's like, OK.\n\n1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:05.360\n But that's not AI, right?\n\n1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:09.080\n That's just a heuristic of like, how did you, in one hour,\n\n1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:10.880\n get 2,000 miles, right?\n\n1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:11.440\n That doesn't.\n\n1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:12.040\n I mean, you're grand.\n\n1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:12.680\n Maybe you're on a VPN.\n\n1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:14.040\n There's other ways to happen.\n\n1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:16.040\n That's just a basic prediction based on the idea\n\n1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:19.440\n that people pretty much don't move around that much.\n\n1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:20.920\n They may travel occasionally.\n\n1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:23.160\n But nobody, unless you're a traveling salesman that's\n\n1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:26.280\n literally traveling the world every day,\n\n1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:28.280\n there's so much repetition and predictability\n\n1:07:28.280 --> 1:07:29.740\n in terms of things you're going to do.\n\n1:07:29.740 --> 1:07:32.240\n And I think good software anticipates your needs.\n\n1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:33.560\n For example, Google, I think it's\n\n1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:35.320\n called Google Now or whatever that Google thing is\n\n1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:36.800\n that predicts your commute and predicts,\n\n1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:39.200\n based on your phone location, where are you every day?\n\n1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:41.840\n Well, that's probably where you work, that kind of stuff.\n\n1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:43.920\n I do think computers can get a lot better at that.\n\n1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:46.320\n I hesitate to call it full blown AI.\n\n1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:48.880\n It's just computers getting better at like, first of all,\n\n1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:50.560\n they have a ton of data because everybody has a smartphone.\n\n1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:52.080\n Now, all of a sudden, we have all this data\n\n1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:53.880\n that we didn't have before about location,\n\n1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:59.240\n about communication, and feeding that into some basic heuristics\n\n1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:01.080\n and maybe some fancy algorithms that turn it\n\n1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:03.160\n into predictions of anticipating your needs,\n\n1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:04.520\n like a friend would, right?\n\n1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:06.160\n Like, oh, hey, I see your home.\n\n1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:07.540\n Would you like some dinner, right?\n\n1:08:07.540 --> 1:08:09.320\n Like, let's go get some food, because that's usually\n\n1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:10.840\n what we do at this time of day, right?\n\n1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:13.680\n In the context of actually the act of programming,\n\n1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.680\n do you see IDEs improving and making\n\n1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:17.400\n the life of programming as better?\n\n1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:19.160\n I do think that is possible, because there's\n\n1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:20.760\n a lot of repetition in programming, right?\n\n1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:23.680\n Oh, you know, Clippy would be the bad example of, oh, I see.\n\n1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:25.960\n It looks like you're writing a for loop.\n\n1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:28.400\n But there are patterns in code, right?\n\n1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:30.880\n And actually, libraries are kind of like that, right?\n\n1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:35.440\n Rather than go code up your own HTTP request library,\n\n1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:37.560\n it's like, well, you'd use one of the existing ones\n\n1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:38.400\n that we have.\n\n1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:39.800\n That's already a troubleshot, right?\n\n1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:41.440\n It's not AI, per se.\n\n1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:46.180\n It's just building better LEGO bricks, bigger LEGO bricks,\n\n1:08:46.180 --> 1:08:47.760\n that have more functionality in them,\n\n1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:49.460\n so people don't have to worry about the low level\n\n1:08:49.460 --> 1:08:50.560\n stuff as much anymore.\n\n1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:52.040\n Like, WordPress, for example, to me,\n\n1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:54.160\n is like a tool for somebody who isn't a programmer\n\n1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:55.800\n to do something.\n\n1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:57.680\n I mean, you can turn WordPress into anything.\n\n1:08:57.680 --> 1:08:59.800\n It's kind of crazy, actually, through plugins, right?\n\n1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:01.400\n And that's not programming, per se.\n\n1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:04.560\n It's just LEGO bricks stacking WordPress elements, right?\n\n1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:06.620\n And a little bit of configuration glue.\n\n1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:09.040\n So I would say, maybe in a broader sense, what I'm seeing,\n\n1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:14.040\n like, there'll be more gluing and less actual programming.\n\n1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:15.600\n And that's a good thing, right?\n\n1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:16.720\n Because most of the stuff you need\n\n1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:17.960\n is kind of out there already.\n\n1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:20.120\n You said 1970s, Unix.\n\n1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:25.120\n Do you see PHP and these kind of old remnants\n\n1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.760\n of the early birth of programming\n\n1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:33.760\n remaining with us for a long time?\n\n1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:35.640\n Like you said, Unix in itself.\n\n1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:40.640\n Do you see, ultimately, this stuff just being there\n\n1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:42.940\n out of momentum?\n\n1:09:42.940 --> 1:09:44.160\n I kind of do.\n\n1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.200\n I mean, I was a big believer in Windows early on.\n\n1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:47.400\n And I was a big, you know, I was like,\n\n1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:48.780\n Unix, what a waste of time.\n\n1:09:48.780 --> 1:09:50.120\n But over time, I've completely flipped on that,\n\n1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:51.720\n where I was like, okay, the Unix guys were right.\n\n1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:54.640\n And pretty much Microsoft and Windows were kind of wrong,\n\n1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:55.760\n at least on the server side.\n\n1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:57.400\n Now, on the desktop, right, you need a GUI,\n\n1:09:57.400 --> 1:09:58.240\n you need all that stuff.\n\n1:09:58.240 --> 1:09:59.200\n And you have the two philosophies,\n\n1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:02.680\n like Apple built on Unix, effectively, Darwin.\n\n1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:04.600\n And on the desktop, it's a slightly different story.\n\n1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:07.000\n But on the server side, where you're gonna be programming.\n\n1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:08.480\n Now, it's a question of where the programming's gonna be.\n\n1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:10.760\n There's gonna be a lot more like client side programming,\n\n1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:13.620\n because technically, discourse is client side programming.\n\n1:10:13.620 --> 1:10:14.520\n The way you get discourse,\n\n1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:16.200\n we deliver a big ball of JavaScript,\n\n1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.260\n which is then executed locally.\n\n1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:20.980\n So we're really using a lot more local computing power.\n\n1:10:20.980 --> 1:10:22.360\n We'll still retrieve the data, obviously,\n\n1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:24.320\n we have to display the posts on the screen and so forth.\n\n1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:27.040\n But in terms of like sorting and a lot of the basic stuff,\n\n1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:29.480\n we're using the host processor.\n\n1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:31.280\n But to the extent that a lot of programming\n\n1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:33.680\n is still gonna be server side, I would say, yeah,\n\n1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:35.320\n the Unix philosophy definitely won.\n\n1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:38.640\n And there'll be different veneers over Unix,\n\n1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:40.800\n but it's still, if you peel away one or two layers,\n\n1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.340\n it's gonna be Unixy for a long, I think Unix won.\n\n1:10:44.340 --> 1:10:45.520\n I mean, so definitively.\n\n1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:47.440\n It's interesting to hear you say that,\n\n1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:49.080\n because you've done so much excellent work\n\n1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:52.840\n on the Microsoft side in terms of backend development.\n\n1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:53.680\n Cool.\n\n1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:56.960\n So what's the future hold for Jeff Atwood?\n\n1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:01.820\n I mean, the discourse, continuing the discourse\n\n1:11:01.820 --> 1:11:03.960\n in trying to improve conversation on the web?\n\n1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:05.640\n Well, discourse is what I've viewed as a,\n\n1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:07.040\n and originally I called it a five year project,\n\n1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:08.800\n then really quickly revised that to a 10 year project.\n\n1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:12.280\n So we started in early 2013,\n\n1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:13.640\n that's when we launched the first version.\n\n1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:16.120\n So we're still five years in.\n\n1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:17.400\n This is the part where it starts getting good.\n\n1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:18.540\n Like we have a good product now.\n\n1:11:18.540 --> 1:11:21.760\n Discourse, there's any project you build in software,\n\n1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:23.280\n it takes three years to build what you want it\n\n1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:24.100\n to build anyway.\n\n1:11:24.100 --> 1:11:26.560\n Like V1 is gonna be terrible, which it was.\n\n1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:27.400\n But you ship it anyway,\n\n1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:29.000\n because that's how you get better at stuff.\n\n1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:29.920\n It's about turning the crank.\n\n1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:31.400\n It's not about V1 being perfect,\n\n1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:32.800\n because that's ridiculous.\n\n1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:35.560\n It's about V1, then let's get really good at V1.1,\n\n1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:38.000\n 1.2, 1.3, like how fast can we iterate?\n\n1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.120\n And I think we're iterating like crazy on discourse,\n\n1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:41.920\n to the point that like, it's a really good product now.\n\n1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:43.600\n We have serious momentum.\n\n1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:46.240\n And my original vision was,\n\n1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:48.120\n I wanna be the WordPress of discussion.\n\n1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:49.860\n Meaning someone came to you and said,\n\n1:11:49.860 --> 1:11:50.760\n I wanna start a blog.\n\n1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:53.000\n Although the very question is kind of archaic now.\n\n1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.320\n It's like, who actually blogs anymore?\n\n1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:59.000\n But I wanted the answer to that to be,\n\n1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.360\n it would be WordPress normally,\n\n1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:02.240\n because that's the obvious choice\n\n1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:04.200\n for blogging most of the time.\n\n1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:06.960\n But if someone said, hey, I need a group of people\n\n1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.760\n to get together and do something,\n\n1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:10.400\n the answer should be discourse, right?\n\n1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:11.800\n That should be the default answer for people.\n\n1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.360\n Because it's open source, it's free,\n\n1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:14.200\n doesn't cost you anything.\n\n1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:15.960\n You control it, you can run it.\n\n1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:17.400\n Your minimum server cost for discourse\n\n1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:19.560\n is five bucks a month at this point.\n\n1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:21.560\n They actually got the VPS prices down.\n\n1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.860\n It used to be $10 a month for one gigabyte of RAM,\n\n1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:28.400\n which we have a kind of heavy stack.\n\n1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:30.280\n Like there's a lot of stuff in discourse.\n\n1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.520\n You need Postgres, you need Redis, you need Ruby,\n\n1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:35.760\n and Rails, you need a sidekick for scheduling.\n\n1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:36.960\n It's not a trivial amount of stuff\n\n1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:38.040\n because we were architected for like,\n\n1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:39.460\n look, we're building for the next 10 years.\n\n1:12:39.460 --> 1:12:41.960\n I don't care about shared PHP hosting.\n\n1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:44.160\n That's not my model.\n\n1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:45.880\n My idea is like, hey, eventually,\n\n1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:47.480\n this is gonna be very cheap for everybody\n\n1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:49.120\n and I wanna build it right.\n\n1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:53.460\n Using again, higher, bigger building block levels, right?\n\n1:12:53.460 --> 1:12:54.440\n That have more requirements.\n\n1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:56.600\n And there's a WordPress model of WordPress.org,\n\n1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:57.680\n WordPress.com.\n\n1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:00.960\n Is there a central hosting for discourse or no?\n\n1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:01.800\n There is.\n\n1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:03.600\n We're not strictly segmenting into the open source\n\n1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.080\n versus the commercial side.\n\n1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:06.000\n We have a hosting business.\n\n1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:07.080\n That's how discourse makes money\n\n1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:08.840\n is we host discourse instances\n\n1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.640\n and we have really close relationship with our customers\n\n1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:14.640\n of the symbiosis of them giving us feedback on the product.\n\n1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:16.440\n We definitely wait feedback from customers\n\n1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:18.360\n a lot heavier than feedback from somebody\n\n1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:20.880\n who just wanders by and gives feedback.\n\n1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:22.440\n But that's where we make all our money.\n\n1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:24.600\n But we don't have a strict division.\n\n1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:26.600\n We encourage people to use discourse.\n\n1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:29.040\n Like the whole point is that it's free, right?\n\n1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:29.960\n Anybody can set it up.\n\n1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:32.600\n I don't wanna be the only person that hosts discourse.\n\n1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:34.200\n That's absolutely not the goal.\n\n1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:36.280\n But it is a primary way for us to build a business\n\n1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:37.600\n and it's actually kind of a great business.\n\n1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:40.280\n I mean, the business is going really, really well\n\n1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:41.340\n in terms of hosting.\n\n1:13:41.340 --> 1:13:44.280\n So I used to work at Google Research.\n\n1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:47.040\n It's a company that's basically funded on advertisements.\n\n1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:48.120\n So it's Facebook.\n\n1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:50.360\n Let me ask if you can comment on it.\n\n1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:53.500\n I think advertisement is best.\n\n1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:56.580\n So you'd be extremely critical on what ads are\n\n1:13:56.580 --> 1:13:59.700\n but at its best, it's actually serving you.\n\n1:13:59.700 --> 1:14:02.000\n In a sense, it's giving you, it's connecting you\n\n1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:05.640\n to what you would want to explore.\n\n1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:08.040\n So it's like related posts or related content.\n\n1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:10.200\n It's the same, that's the best of advertisement.\n\n1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:15.200\n So discourse is connecting people based on their interests.\n\n1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:20.080\n It seems like a place where advertisement at its best\n\n1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:21.740\n could actually serve the users.\n\n1:14:21.740 --> 1:14:24.880\n Is that something that you're considering thinking about\n\n1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:29.440\n as a way to bring, to financially support the platform?\n\n1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:31.360\n That's interesting because I actually have\n\n1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:32.560\n a contrarian view of advertising,\n\n1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:33.760\n which I kind of agree with you.\n\n1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:36.800\n I recently installed AdBlocker reluctantly\n\n1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.280\n because I don't like to do that.\n\n1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:40.580\n But the performance of the ads, man,\n\n1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:43.280\n they're so heavy now and it's just crazy.\n\n1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:45.040\n So it's almost like a performance argument\n\n1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:47.200\n more than like, I actually am pro ads\n\n1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:49.480\n and I have a contrarian viewpoint.\n\n1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:50.320\n I agree with you.\n\n1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:51.960\n If you do ads right, it's serving you stuff\n\n1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:53.300\n you would be interested in anyway.\n\n1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:56.520\n I don't mind that, that actually is kind of a good thing.\n\n1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:00.000\n So plus I think it's rational to wanna support\n\n1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.680\n the people that are doing this work\n\n1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:02.600\n through seeing their ads.\n\n1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:04.040\n But that said, I run AdBlock now,\n\n1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:07.520\n which I didn't wanna do, but I was convinced\n\n1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:10.080\n by all these articles, like 30, 40 megabytes of stuff\n\n1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:11.600\n just to serve you ads.\n\n1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:15.980\n Yeah, it feels like ads now are like the experts exchange\n\n1:15:15.980 --> 1:15:18.240\n of whenever you start a stock overflow.\n\n1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:19.440\n It's a little bit, it's overwhelming.\n\n1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:21.040\n Oh, there's so many companies in ad tech\n\n1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:21.880\n that it's embarrassing.\n\n1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:23.180\n Like you can do that, have you seen those logo charts\n\n1:15:23.180 --> 1:15:24.280\n of like just the whole page?\n\n1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:26.200\n It's like you can't even see them, they're so small.\n\n1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:27.800\n There's so many companies in the space.\n\n1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:29.640\n But since you brought it up, I do wanna point out\n\n1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:31.840\n that very, very few discourse sites actually run\n\n1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:33.080\n using an ad supported model.\n\n1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:34.680\n It's not effective.\n\n1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:37.600\n Like it's too diluted, it's too weird,\n\n1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:40.560\n it doesn't pay well, and like users hate it.\n\n1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:42.800\n So it's a combination of like users hate it,\n\n1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:44.440\n it doesn't actually work that well in practice.\n\n1:15:44.440 --> 1:15:45.760\n Like in theory, yes, I agree with you.\n\n1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:48.400\n If you had clean, fast ads that were exactly\n\n1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:50.320\n the stuff you would be interested in, awesome.\n\n1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:52.440\n We're so far from that though, right?\n\n1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:53.800\n Like, and Google does an okay job.\n\n1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:55.380\n They do retargeting and stuff like that,\n\n1:15:55.380 --> 1:15:59.280\n but in the real world, discourse sites\n\n1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:01.020\n rarely can make ads work.\n\n1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:03.020\n It just doesn't work for so many reasons.\n\n1:16:03.020 --> 1:16:05.600\n But you know what does work is subscriptions,\n\n1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:10.600\n Patreon, affiliate codes for like Amazon,\n\n1:16:10.660 --> 1:16:13.080\n of like just, oh, here's a cool yo yo, click,\n\n1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:14.360\n and then you click and go to Amazon,\n\n1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:15.680\n they get a small percentage of that,\n\n1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:17.120\n which is fair, I think.\n\n1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:19.120\n I mean, because you saw the yo yo on that site\n\n1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:21.080\n and you clicked through and you bought it, right?\n\n1:16:21.080 --> 1:16:22.560\n That's fair for them to get 5% of that\n\n1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:24.200\n or 2% of that, whatever it is.\n\n1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:25.960\n Those things definitely work.\n\n1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:28.580\n In fact, a site that I used to participate on a lot,\n\n1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:29.880\n I helped the owner.\n\n1:16:29.880 --> 1:16:32.440\n One of the things, I got them to switch to discourse.\n\n1:16:32.440 --> 1:16:34.200\n I basically paid them to switch to discourse\n\n1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:35.320\n because I was like, look, you guys got to switch.\n\n1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:38.520\n I can't come here anymore on this terrible software.\n\n1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:40.120\n But I was like, look, and on top of that,\n\n1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:42.280\n like you're serving people ads that they hate.\n\n1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:43.920\n Like you should just go full on Patreon\n\n1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:45.320\n because he had a little bit of Patreon.\n\n1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:49.720\n Go full on Patreon, do the Amazon affiliates thing\n\n1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:51.960\n for any Amazon links that get posted and just do that\n\n1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:53.600\n and just triple down on that stuff.\n\n1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:55.320\n And that's worked really well for them\n\n1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:56.780\n and this creator in particular.\n\n1:16:56.780 --> 1:16:59.480\n So that stuff works, but traditional ads,\n\n1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:01.720\n I mean, definitely not working, at least on discourse.\n\n1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:03.400\n So last question.\n\n1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:05.920\n You've created the code keyboard.\n\n1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:09.860\n I've programmed most of my adult life on a Kinesis keyboard.\n\n1:17:09.860 --> 1:17:12.080\n I have one upstairs now.\n\n1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:14.520\n Can you describe what a mechanical keyboard is\n\n1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:16.720\n and why is it something that makes you happy?\n\n1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:18.800\n Well, you know, this is another fetish item, really.\n\n1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:20.160\n Like, it's not required.\n\n1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:22.240\n You can do programming on any kind of keyboard,\n\n1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:23.880\n even like an onscreen keyboard.\n\n1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:25.960\n Oh, god, that's terrifying.\n\n1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:27.000\n But you could.\n\n1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:28.760\n I mean, if you look back at the early days of computing,\n\n1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:31.400\n there were chiclet keyboards, which are awful.\n\n1:17:31.400 --> 1:17:32.520\n But what's a chiclet keyboard?\n\n1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:33.120\n Oh, god.\n\n1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:36.200\n OK, well, it's just like thin rubber membranes.\n\n1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:37.680\n Oh, the rubber ones, oh, no.\n\n1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:38.840\n Super bad, right?\n\n1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:40.360\n So it's a fetish item.\n\n1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.280\n All that really says is, look, I care really about keyboards\n\n1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:45.080\n because the keyboard is the primary method of communication\n\n1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:46.240\n with the computer.\n\n1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:49.320\n So it's just like having a nice mic for this podcast.\n\n1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:50.600\n You want a nice keyboard, right?\n\n1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:52.200\n Because it has a very tactile feel.\n\n1:17:52.200 --> 1:17:54.040\n I can tell exactly when I press the key.\n\n1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:55.080\n I get that little click.\n\n1:17:55.080 --> 1:17:56.480\n So, oh, and it feels good.\n\n1:17:56.480 --> 1:17:57.980\n And it's also kind of a fetish item.\n\n1:17:57.980 --> 1:18:00.320\n It's like, wow, I care enough about programming\n\n1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:02.440\n that I care about the tool, the primary tool,\n\n1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:03.320\n that I use to communicate with the computer,\n\n1:18:03.320 --> 1:18:06.440\n make sure it's as good as it feels good to use for me.\n\n1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:08.360\n And I can be very productive with it.\n\n1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:10.720\n So to be honest, it's a little bit of a fetish item,\n\n1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:11.320\n but a good one.\n\n1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:12.560\n It indicates that you're serious.\n\n1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:13.640\n It indicates you're interested.\n\n1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:15.280\n It indicates that you care about the fundamentals.\n\n1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:17.520\n Because you know what makes you a good programmer?\n\n1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:19.360\n Being able to type really fast, right?\n\n1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:20.600\n This is true, right?\n\n1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:23.480\n So a core skill is just being able to type fast enough\n\n1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:26.120\n to get your ideas out of your head into the code base.\n\n1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:28.400\n So just practicing your typing can make you\n\n1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:29.760\n a better programmer.\n\n1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:33.720\n It is also something that makes you,\n\n1:18:33.720 --> 1:18:36.640\n well, makes you enjoy typing, correct?\n\n1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:39.940\n The actual act, something about the process.\n\n1:18:39.940 --> 1:18:41.220\n Like I play piano.\n\n1:18:41.220 --> 1:18:42.060\n It's tactile.\n\n1:18:42.060 --> 1:18:46.200\n There's a tactile feel that ultimately feeds the passion,\n\n1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:47.000\n makes you happy.\n\n1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:47.400\n Right.\n\n1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:47.840\n No, totally.\n\n1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:48.160\n That's it.\n\n1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:50.000\n I mean, and it's funny because artisanal keyboards have\n\n1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:50.640\n exploded.\n\n1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:53.400\n Like Massdrop has gone ballistic with this stuff.\n\n1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:55.560\n There's probably like 500 keyboard projects\n\n1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:56.520\n on Massdrop alone.\n\n1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:58.120\n And there's some other guy I follow on Twitter.\n\n1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:00.400\n I used to write for the site The Tech Report way\n\n1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:01.360\n back in the day.\n\n1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:02.440\n And he's like, every week he's just\n\n1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:05.000\n posting what I call keyboard porn of just cool keyboards.\n\n1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.160\n Like, oh my god, those look really cool, right?\n\n1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:09.760\n It's like, how many keyboards does this guy have, right?\n\n1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:10.680\n It's kind of like me with yo yos.\n\n1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:11.480\n How many yo yos do you have?\n\n1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:12.320\n How many do you need?\n\n1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:14.880\n Well, technically one, but I like a lot.\n\n1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:15.800\n I don't know why.\n\n1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:17.200\n So same thing with keyboards.\n\n1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:18.880\n So yeah, they're awesome.\n\n1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:20.720\n Like, I highly recommend anybody that\n\n1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:23.040\n doesn't have a mechanical to research it, look into it,\n\n1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:24.360\n and see what you like.\n\n1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:26.260\n And it's ultimately a fetish item.\n\n1:19:26.260 --> 1:19:30.120\n But I think these sort of items, these religious artifacts\n\n1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:32.160\n that we have, are part of what make us human.\n\n1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:33.800\n Like, that part's important, right?\n\n1:19:33.800 --> 1:19:35.720\n It's kind of what makes life worth living.\n\n1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:37.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.840\n It's not necessary in the strictest sense,\n\n1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:42.280\n but ain't nothing necessary if you think about it, right?\n\n1:19:42.280 --> 1:19:44.240\n Like, so yeah, why not?\n\n1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:45.320\n So sure.\n\n1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:47.440\n Jeff, thank you so much for talking today.\n\n1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:48.280\n Yeah, you're welcome.\n\n1:19:48.280 --> 1:20:09.400\n Thanks for having me.\n\n"
