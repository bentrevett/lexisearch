He's a neuroscientist at Stanford,\n\n00:06.480 --> 00:08.800\n a world class researcher and educator,\n\n00:08.800 --> 00:11.920\n and now he has a new podcast on YouTube\n\n00:11.920 --> 00:15.260\n and all the usual places called Huberman Lab\n\n00:15.260 --> 00:18.120\n that I can't recommend highly enough.\n\n00:18.120 --> 00:20.200\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:20.200 --> 00:24.240\n Masterclass Online Courses for Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee,\n\n00:24.240 --> 00:26.400\n Magic Spoon Low Carb Cereal,\n\n00:26.400 --> 00:28.680\n and BetterHelp Online Therapy.\n\n00:28.680 --> 00:31.680\n Click the sponsor links to get a discount.\n\n00:31.680 --> 00:34.360\n By the way, Masterclass is testing to see\n\n00:34.360 --> 00:36.880\n if they want to support this podcast long term.\n\n00:36.880 --> 00:40.280\n So if you're on the fence, now is the time to sign up.\n\n00:40.280 --> 00:42.160\n And I'm pretty sure Andrew will have\n\n00:42.160 --> 00:44.640\n a neuroscience masterclass on there soon enough,\n\n00:44.640 --> 00:46.320\n though his podcast is basically\n\n00:46.320 --> 00:48.840\n a weekly masterclass in itself.\n\n00:48.840 --> 00:52.080\n As a side note, let me say that Andrew is a friend\n\n00:52.080 --> 00:53.760\n and a new collaborator.\n\n00:53.760 --> 00:55.600\n We're working on a paper together\n\n00:55.600 --> 00:58.500\n about a topic we're both really passionate about.\n\n00:58.500 --> 01:01.380\n At the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.\n\n01:01.380 --> 01:04.640\n But that's probably many months away from being published.\n\n01:04.640 --> 01:06.800\n Still, I'm really excited about this work.\n\n01:06.800 --> 01:08.680\n He's one of the smartest and kindest people\n\n01:08.680 --> 01:11.080\n I have the pleasure of talking to on this podcast,\n\n01:11.080 --> 01:14.380\n so I hope we'll talk many more times in the future.\n\n01:14.380 --> 01:16.640\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:16.640 --> 01:19.560\n review it on our podcast, follow on Spotify,\n\n01:19.560 --> 01:21.580\n support it on Patreon, or connect with me\n\n01:21.580 --> 01:23.680\n on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n01:23.680 --> 01:27.260\n And now, here's my conversation with Andrew Huberman.\n\n01:27.260 --> 01:30.500\n Why do humans need sleep?\n\n01:30.500 --> 01:33.540\n Let's go with a big first question.\n\n01:33.540 --> 01:36.920\n Okay, well, the answer I'll start with\n\n01:36.920 --> 01:38.620\n is the one that I always default to\n\n01:38.620 --> 01:40.940\n when there's a why question,\n\n01:40.940 --> 01:44.260\n which is I wasn't consulted at the design phase.\n\n01:44.260 --> 01:49.260\n So I wriggle my way out of giving a absolute answer, right?\n\n01:50.580 --> 01:55.140\n But there's one mechanism that's very clear\n\n01:55.140 --> 01:56.300\n that's super important,\n\n01:56.300 --> 01:59.140\n which is that the longer we are awake,\n\n01:59.140 --> 02:04.100\n the more adenosine accumulates in our brain.\n\n02:04.100 --> 02:07.480\n And adenosine binds to adenosine receptors,\n\n02:07.480 --> 02:08.600\n no surprise there,\n\n02:08.600 --> 02:12.420\n and it creates the feeling of sleepiness\n\n02:12.420 --> 02:15.720\n independent of time of day or night.\n\n02:15.720 --> 02:17.340\n So there are two mechanisms.\n\n02:17.340 --> 02:22.100\n One is we get sleepy as adenosine accumulates.\n\n02:22.100 --> 02:23.220\n The longer we've been awake,\n\n02:23.220 --> 02:26.200\n the more adenosine has accumulated in our system.\n\n02:26.200 --> 02:31.200\n But how sleepy we get for a given amount of adenosine\n\n02:31.500 --> 02:34.700\n depends on where we are in this so called circadian cycle.\n\n02:34.700 --> 02:35.860\n And the circadian cycle\n\n02:35.860 --> 02:39.300\n is just this very, very well conserved oscillation.\n\n02:39.300 --> 02:41.100\n It's a temperature oscillation\n\n02:41.100 --> 02:42.860\n where you go from a low point.\n\n02:42.860 --> 02:44.500\n Typically, if you're awake during the day\n\n02:44.500 --> 02:45.980\n and you're asleep at night,\n\n02:45.980 --> 02:50.660\n your lowest temperature point will be like 3 a.m., 4 a.m.,\n\n02:50.660 --> 02:52.660\n and then your temperature will start to creep up\n\n02:52.660 --> 02:53.900\n as you wake up in the morning,\n\n02:53.900 --> 02:56.420\n and then it'll peak in the late afternoon,\n\n02:56.420 --> 02:58.500\n and then it'll start to drop again toward the evening,\n\n02:58.500 --> 02:59.660\n and then you get sleep again.\n\n02:59.660 --> 03:03.500\n That oscillation in temperature takes 24 hours.\n\n03:03.500 --> 03:04.340\n Plus or minus.\n\n03:04.340 --> 03:05.160\n Plus your temperature.\n\n03:05.160 --> 03:06.620\n Yeah, plus or minus an hour.\n\n03:06.620 --> 03:08.380\n And I don't,\n\n03:08.380 --> 03:10.620\n even though I wasn't consulted at the design phase,\n\n03:10.620 --> 03:12.700\n I do not think it's a coincidence\n\n03:12.700 --> 03:16.300\n that it's aligned to the 24 hour spin of the Earth\n\n03:16.300 --> 03:17.340\n on its axis.\n\n03:17.340 --> 03:20.460\n The fact that we tend to be bathed in sunlight\n\n03:20.460 --> 03:22.460\n for a portion of that spin,\n\n03:22.460 --> 03:24.340\n and in darkness for the other portion of that spin.\n\n03:24.340 --> 03:25.340\n So there are two mechanisms,\n\n03:25.340 --> 03:28.880\n the adenosine accumulation and the circadian time point\n\n03:28.880 --> 03:29.720\n that we happen to be at.\n\n03:29.720 --> 03:32.680\n And those converge to create a sense\n\n03:32.680 --> 03:34.060\n of sleepiness, awakefulness.\n\n03:34.060 --> 03:37.140\n The simple way to reveal these two mechanisms,\n\n03:37.140 --> 03:39.860\n to uncouple them, is stay up for 24 hours,\n\n03:39.860 --> 03:42.420\n and you will find that even though you've been,\n\n03:42.420 --> 03:46.260\n let's say you stay up midnight, 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,\n\n03:46.260 --> 03:48.260\n provided you're on a regular schedule,\n\n03:48.260 --> 03:50.980\n like that I follow, not like the kind that you follow,\n\n03:50.980 --> 03:55.300\n I will get very sleepy around 3, 4 a.m.,\n\n03:55.300 --> 03:58.220\n but then around 5 or 6 or 7 a.m.,\n\n03:58.220 --> 03:59.700\n which is my normal wake up time,\n\n03:59.700 --> 04:01.740\n I'll start to feel more alert,\n\n04:01.740 --> 04:06.020\n even though adenosine has been accumulating further.\n\n04:06.020 --> 04:08.940\n So adenosine is higher for me the longer I stay up,\n\n04:08.940 --> 04:11.020\n and yet I feel more alert than I did a few hours ago.\n\n04:11.020 --> 04:13.660\n And that's because these are two interacting forces.\n\n04:13.660 --> 04:15.340\n So adenosine makes you sleepy,\n\n04:15.340 --> 04:17.620\n and then just how sleepy or how awake you feel\n\n04:17.620 --> 04:19.020\n also depends on where you are\n\n04:19.020 --> 04:21.260\n in this temperature oscillation that takes 24 hours.\n\n04:21.260 --> 04:22.300\n Okay, so that's fascinating.\n\n04:22.300 --> 04:24.700\n So there's a bunch of oscillations going on,\n\n04:24.700 --> 04:28.180\n and then they kind of, through the evolutionary process,\n\n04:28.180 --> 04:30.700\n have evolved to all be aligned somewhat,\n\n04:30.700 --> 04:31.580\n and they interplay.\n\n04:31.580 --> 04:35.980\n So you said your body temperature goes up and down.\n\n04:35.980 --> 04:40.580\n There's chemicals in your brain that oscillate,\n\n04:40.580 --> 04:42.220\n and then there's the actual oscillation\n\n04:42.220 --> 04:46.220\n of the sun in the sky.\n\n04:46.220 --> 04:51.220\n So all of that together has some impact on each other,\n\n04:52.700 --> 04:55.220\n and somehow that all results in us\n\n04:55.220 --> 04:57.300\n wanting to go to sleep every night.\n\n04:57.300 --> 05:00.100\n Right, so, and we can get right into the meat of this,\n\n05:00.100 --> 05:01.540\n so I guess we just dove right in,\n\n05:01.540 --> 05:05.500\n but the temperature oscillation\n\n05:05.500 --> 05:08.100\n is the effector of the circadian clock.\n\n05:08.100 --> 05:10.460\n So every cell in our body has a 24 hour rhythm\n\n05:10.460 --> 05:14.660\n that's dictated by genes like clock, purr, BMAL.\n\n05:14.660 --> 05:16.460\n This is one of the great successes of biology.\n\n05:16.460 --> 05:18.620\n They give a Nobel prize to Rappert,\n\n05:18.620 --> 05:19.900\n I don't know if Rappert got it, forgive me,\n\n05:19.900 --> 05:22.500\n but sorry if you got it, Steve, congratulations.\n\n05:22.500 --> 05:25.300\n If you didn't, I'm sorry, I wasn't on the committee.\n\n05:25.300 --> 05:28.980\n Nonetheless, did beautiful work, Steve Rappert and others,\n\n05:28.980 --> 05:31.740\n but Mike Roshbosh and other people worked out\n\n05:31.740 --> 05:34.140\n these mechanisms in flies and bacteria and mammals.\n\n05:34.140 --> 05:37.420\n There are these genes that create 24 hour oscillations\n\n05:37.420 --> 05:40.580\n in gene expression, et cetera, in every cell of our body.\n\n05:40.580 --> 05:43.220\n But what aligns those is a signal\n\n05:43.220 --> 05:44.620\n from the master circadian clock,\n\n05:44.620 --> 05:46.180\n which sits right above the roof of the mouth,\n\n05:46.180 --> 05:48.660\n called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.\n\n05:48.660 --> 05:53.040\n And that clock synchronizes all the clocks of the body\n\n05:53.040 --> 05:55.920\n to this general temperature rhythm\n\n05:55.920 --> 05:59.020\n by way of controlling systemic temperature,\n\n05:59.020 --> 06:00.060\n which makes perfect sense.\n\n06:00.060 --> 06:02.260\n If you want to create a general oscillation\n\n06:02.260 --> 06:05.580\n in all the tissues and organs of the body, use temperature.\n\n06:05.580 --> 06:07.780\n And so that work on temperature,\n\n06:07.780 --> 06:08.980\n if people want to explore it further,\n\n06:08.980 --> 06:11.300\n was Joe Takahashi, who was at Northwestern,\n\n06:11.300 --> 06:14.460\n now at UT Southwestern in Dallas.\n\n06:14.460 --> 06:18.280\n And it is absolutely clear that humans do better\n\n06:18.280 --> 06:20.540\n on a diurnal schedule, sorry, Lex,\n\n06:20.540 --> 06:23.340\n than a nocturnal schedule, because you could say,\n\n06:23.340 --> 06:27.460\n well, provided I sleep and push adenosine back downhill,\n\n06:27.460 --> 06:28.540\n which is what happens when we sleep,\n\n06:28.540 --> 06:30.380\n adenosine is then reduced.\n\n06:30.380 --> 06:33.500\n And provided I am on more or less a 24 hour schedule,\n\n06:33.500 --> 06:35.760\n why should it matter that I'm awake when the sun's out\n\n06:35.760 --> 06:38.700\n and I'm asleep when the sun is down?\n\n06:38.700 --> 06:41.880\n But it turns out that if you look at health metrics,\n\n06:41.880 --> 06:46.100\n people that are strictly nocturnal do far worse\n\n06:46.100 --> 06:49.260\n on immune function, on metabolic function, et cetera,\n\n06:49.260 --> 06:50.580\n than people who are diurnal,\n\n06:50.580 --> 06:51.740\n who are awake during the daytime.\n\n06:51.740 --> 06:54.540\n And animals that are nocturnal, it's the opposite.\n\n06:54.540 --> 06:56.660\n And animals that are so called crepuscular,\n\n06:56.660 --> 06:59.660\n which tend to be active at dawn and at dusk,\n\n06:59.660 --> 07:02.120\n this is a beautiful system, I won't go down that rabbit hole,\n\n07:02.120 --> 07:05.400\n but these are animals whose visual systems operate best.\n\n07:05.400 --> 07:07.660\n They tend to be predators like mountain lions.\n\n07:07.660 --> 07:10.300\n They have optimized their waking times\n\n07:10.300 --> 07:12.740\n for the times when the animals they eat\n\n07:12.740 --> 07:15.340\n can't see well in those light conditions.\n\n07:15.340 --> 07:18.020\n But given the rod cone ratios in their eyes,\n\n07:18.020 --> 07:20.020\n that the mountain lion is picking off.\n\n07:20.020 --> 07:22.260\n It's like when you see a special forces\n\n07:22.260 --> 07:24.680\n and they are looking through night vision goggles\n\n07:24.680 --> 07:26.800\n and they have a clear advantage, right?\n\n07:26.800 --> 07:28.220\n They are seeing in the dark.\n\n07:28.220 --> 07:30.420\n That's basically what it's like to be a mountain lion\n\n07:30.420 --> 07:32.880\n as opposed to a bunny rabbit.\n\n07:32.880 --> 07:35.860\n Would you say that a lot of these cycles evolved\n\n07:35.860 --> 07:38.140\n in the predator prey relationships\n\n07:38.140 --> 07:39.900\n of the different throughout the food chain?\n\n07:39.900 --> 07:43.180\n So it's basically all somehow has to do with survival\n\n07:43.180 --> 07:46.940\n in this complicated web of predators and prey.\n\n07:46.940 --> 07:49.220\n Almost certainly, there had to have been a time\n\n07:49.220 --> 07:52.500\n in which humans being awake and active at night,\n\n07:52.500 --> 07:54.700\n as opposed to during the day,\n\n07:54.700 --> 07:58.180\n led to higher levels of lethality.\n\n07:58.180 --> 08:00.300\n And probably particular in kids,\n\n08:00.300 --> 08:01.900\n you imagine kids running around in the dark\n\n08:01.900 --> 08:03.740\n and getting that where there are a lot of animals\n\n08:03.740 --> 08:05.620\n that can see really well under those conditions\n\n08:05.620 --> 08:06.620\n and humans can't.\n\n08:06.620 --> 08:08.620\n And this would be all preelectricity.\n\n08:08.620 --> 08:10.040\n Even if you're carrying a torch,\n\n08:10.040 --> 08:12.180\n I mean, the range of illumination on a torch\n\n08:12.180 --> 08:16.900\n is nothing compared to what a nighttime predator,\n\n08:16.900 --> 08:19.380\n like a large cat or something can do.\n\n08:19.380 --> 08:21.140\n I mean, they basically, they can see everything they need to\n\n08:21.140 --> 08:24.260\n in order to eat us and not the other way around.\n\n08:24.260 --> 08:26.380\n So one fascinating thing you said\n\n08:26.380 --> 08:30.840\n is that blew my mind and we went right past it,\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:35.560\n which is the temperature is a really powerful,\n\n08:35.560 --> 08:37.620\n like if you were to think about the ways\n\n08:37.620 --> 08:38.940\n that different parts of the body,\n\n08:38.940 --> 08:40.540\n different systems in the body\n\n08:40.540 --> 08:42.440\n would communicate with each other,\n\n08:42.440 --> 08:46.020\n temperature would be a really good one.\n\n08:46.020 --> 08:48.580\n And that just, I mean, maybe it's obvious,\n\n08:48.580 --> 08:51.020\n but it kind of blew my mind just now\n\n08:51.020 --> 08:55.620\n that yeah, these systems are all distributed.\n\n08:55.620 --> 08:58.020\n And they have to kind of,\n\n08:58.020 --> 08:59.680\n they're not actually sending signals,\n\n08:59.680 --> 09:00.820\n but they're coordinating.\n\n09:00.820 --> 09:05.460\n They need some sort of universal thing to look at\n\n09:05.460 --> 09:06.980\n in order to coordinate.\n\n09:06.980 --> 09:11.020\n And temperature is a nice one to build around.\n\n09:11.020 --> 09:14.260\n And that way you could control the behavior\n\n09:14.260 --> 09:15.420\n of all these different systems\n\n09:15.420 --> 09:17.340\n by controlling the temperature.\n\n09:17.340 --> 09:20.060\n Right, it's attractive to think of a mechanism\n\n09:20.060 --> 09:23.340\n where this master circadian clock secretes a peptide\n\n09:23.340 --> 09:25.520\n or something that goes and locks to receptors\n\n09:25.520 --> 09:27.380\n in all the cells and gets it just right.\n\n09:27.380 --> 09:30.020\n But that leaves far too much room for variability,\n\n09:30.020 --> 09:33.780\n binding affinities, cells in a lot of parts of our body\n\n09:33.780 --> 09:35.540\n are at different stages of maturation.\n\n09:35.540 --> 09:37.820\n They're turning over liver cells and so forth.\n\n09:37.820 --> 09:40.260\n And for instance, we have a clock in our gut\n\n09:40.260 --> 09:43.500\n and in our liver such that if we were just take out\n\n09:43.500 --> 09:45.560\n your liver and put it on a table\n\n09:45.560 --> 09:47.340\n and just look at the expression of these genes,\n\n09:47.340 --> 09:49.620\n it would be in a 24 hour oscillation on its own.\n\n09:49.620 --> 09:52.300\n It's independent, but something has to entrain them\n\n09:52.300 --> 09:53.580\n and keep them all synchronized.\n\n09:53.580 --> 09:55.820\n And so it's not obvious that it would be temperature.\n\n09:55.820 --> 09:58.420\n Takahashi's great gift to biology was to show\n\n09:58.420 --> 10:03.420\n that all the stuff coming out of this master circadian clock\n\n10:03.420 --> 10:05.900\n at the end of the day, that's a weird statement,\n\n10:05.900 --> 10:08.700\n no pun intended, at the end of the day and the night,\n\n10:08.700 --> 10:13.220\n at the end of the story, it all boils down to making sure\n\n10:13.220 --> 10:15.380\n that the temperature of tissues oscillates\n\n10:15.380 --> 10:16.700\n in the same fashion.\n\n10:16.700 --> 10:18.900\n That's blowing my mind and thinking like\n\n10:18.900 --> 10:21.740\n what other mechanism could possibly exist\n\n10:21.740 --> 10:23.740\n to create that kind of oscillation.\n\n10:23.740 --> 10:26.860\n Well, you're Russian, it's cold in Russia\n\n10:26.860 --> 10:27.680\n for a lot of the year.\n\n10:27.680 --> 10:29.740\n The hibernation signal in certain animals\n\n10:29.740 --> 10:30.940\n is a remarkable signal.\n\n10:30.940 --> 10:34.140\n There are peptides secreted from this very same clock\n\n10:34.140 --> 10:37.700\n that in animals like ground squirrels or bears,\n\n10:37.700 --> 10:39.860\n they go into a kind of a torpor\n\n10:39.860 --> 10:42.260\n where everything, reproduction, metabolism,\n\n10:42.260 --> 10:44.260\n everything is reduced while they're in their cave.\n\n10:44.260 --> 10:46.460\n They don't actually stay asleep all of winter.\n\n10:46.460 --> 10:47.600\n That's a myth.\n\n10:47.600 --> 10:50.940\n And they actually do these very dramatic\n\n10:50.940 --> 10:53.460\n and periodic arousals from hibernation\n\n10:53.460 --> 10:54.860\n where they just shake and shake and shake.\n\n10:54.860 --> 10:55.700\n It looks like a seizure.\n\n10:55.700 --> 10:57.700\n And then they go back under into the torpor.\n\n10:57.700 --> 11:00.220\n That's from a peptide that's released.\n\n11:00.220 --> 11:01.060\n But that's different\n\n11:01.060 --> 11:03.620\n because that's about shutting down the whole system.\n\n11:03.620 --> 11:06.780\n It's clear that having these very regular oscillations\n\n11:06.780 --> 11:09.440\n every 24 hours is essential for everything\n\n11:09.440 --> 11:11.720\n from metabolism to reproduction.\n\n11:13.020 --> 11:17.220\n Is there an optimal temperature for sleep\n\n11:17.220 --> 11:19.460\n that I should mention?\n\n11:19.460 --> 11:21.360\n I think your latest episode,\n\n11:22.420 --> 11:24.940\n you and people should go check out\n\n11:24.940 --> 11:29.420\n helixsleep.com slash Huberman to support Andrew.\n\n11:29.420 --> 11:30.460\n Thanks for the plug.\n\n11:30.460 --> 11:34.100\n I mean, the amazing thing about this stuff\n\n11:34.100 --> 11:34.940\n that you're creating,\n\n11:34.940 --> 11:37.020\n oh, and yes, you have a new podcast.\n\n11:37.020 --> 11:37.840\n That's amazing.\n\n11:37.840 --> 11:41.500\n In this past month, you did a whole series on sleep,\n\n11:41.500 --> 11:44.080\n which people should definitely check out.\n\n11:44.080 --> 11:45.780\n There's some podcasts that come out\n\n11:47.820 --> 11:51.220\n that just make me want to be a better human being\n\n11:51.220 --> 11:53.280\n by just the quality.\n\n11:53.280 --> 11:57.160\n Three Blue One Brown, Grant Sanderson is like that for me.\n\n11:57.160 --> 12:00.780\n Just like, wow, this is education is best.\n\n12:00.780 --> 12:05.520\n So Andrew symbolizes that, captures that brilliantly.\n\n12:05.520 --> 12:06.780\n So go support the sponsor\n\n12:06.780 --> 12:09.060\n so he doesn't stop doing the thing.\n\n12:09.060 --> 12:11.820\n So I think they have a cooling pad too.\n\n12:11.820 --> 12:15.000\n So the 8 Sleep Mattress sponsors me.\n\n12:17.580 --> 12:19.700\n They sent me a mattress and it's been,\n\n12:19.700 --> 12:23.280\n I've never, listen, I used to sleep on the floor.\n\n12:23.280 --> 12:24.540\n Sleep where you fall.\n\n12:24.540 --> 12:25.460\n Sleep where I fall.\n\n12:25.460 --> 12:26.340\n I don't give a shit.\n\n12:26.340 --> 12:27.860\n It doesn't really matter.\n\n12:27.860 --> 12:32.260\n But so like, I would have never bought a nice mattress\n\n12:32.260 --> 12:33.140\n because it's like, why?\n\n12:33.140 --> 12:33.980\n I'm fine.\n\n12:33.980 --> 12:35.740\n This is a floor, it's fine.\n\n12:35.740 --> 12:40.420\n But it was a game changer to be able to control temperature.\n\n12:40.420 --> 12:41.960\n Like for me, it's cooling.\n\n12:43.060 --> 12:44.500\n I don't know what the hell it is.\n\n12:44.500 --> 12:46.900\n Well, you want the brain and nervous system\n\n12:46.900 --> 12:48.380\n and rest of the body needs to drop\n\n12:48.380 --> 12:50.580\n by about anywhere from two to three degrees\n\n12:50.580 --> 12:52.580\n in order to get into your deepest sleep\n\n12:52.580 --> 12:54.100\n and transition to sleep.\n\n12:54.100 --> 12:55.060\n That's really going to help.\n\n12:55.060 --> 12:57.620\n You don't want to be cold that you're bothered\n\n12:57.620 --> 12:58.660\n and can't fall asleep.\n\n12:58.660 --> 13:00.820\n But that's why some people like it really cold in the room\n\n13:00.820 --> 13:02.980\n and under a warm blanket or with socks on,\n\n13:02.980 --> 13:05.740\n for some people that can be good\n\n13:05.740 --> 13:08.220\n because this temperature oscillation is such\n\n13:08.220 --> 13:10.540\n that as your temperature is dropping,\n\n13:10.540 --> 13:13.980\n that correlates generally with the most sleepy phase\n\n13:13.980 --> 13:16.180\n of your circadian cycle.\n\n13:16.180 --> 13:18.980\n So cool is better for falling and staying asleep\n\n13:18.980 --> 13:20.060\n and sleeping deeply.\n\n13:20.060 --> 13:22.820\n And then I guess like that's what 8 Sleep showed.\n\n13:22.820 --> 13:27.560\n They have like an app is it warms back up to wake you up.\n\n13:27.560 --> 13:29.620\n The idea that I haven't actually used it.\n\n13:29.620 --> 13:31.000\n I'm like, this is stupid.\n\n13:32.720 --> 13:33.760\n People say it works,\n\n13:33.760 --> 13:36.900\n but I just keep it the same temperature throughout the night\n\n13:36.900 --> 13:40.740\n but warming it up, I guess wakes you up,\n\n13:40.740 --> 13:42.600\n which is fascinating.\n\n13:42.600 --> 13:45.140\n Yeah, because the wake up signal is,\n\n13:45.140 --> 13:47.580\n it's interesting to think about it's not just correlated\n\n13:47.580 --> 13:49.020\n with an increase in body temperature.\n\n13:49.020 --> 13:50.860\n The increase in body temperature\n\n13:50.860 --> 13:53.820\n is triggering the release of cortisol from your adrenals.\n\n13:53.820 --> 13:55.380\n And that's the wake up signal.\n\n13:55.380 --> 13:57.540\n Do you think it's absolute temperatures we're talking about\n\n13:57.540 --> 13:59.220\n or is it just even relative?\n\n13:59.220 --> 14:00.820\n Just even just the decrease.\n\n14:00.820 --> 14:01.660\n Well, everyone's gonna have\n\n14:01.660 --> 14:03.300\n slightly different basal temperature.\n\n14:03.300 --> 14:05.800\n The idea that everybody should be 98.6.\n\n14:05.800 --> 14:07.220\n I mean, that's a myth.\n\n14:07.220 --> 14:09.820\n And there are theories that body temperature overall\n\n14:09.820 --> 14:12.020\n has been dropping in the last 50 years or so.\n\n14:12.020 --> 14:15.000\n I doubt that's true for somebody who is athletic like you\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.340\n and is young and healthy.\n\n14:17.340 --> 14:22.340\n But basically the coldest period of that 24 hour cycle\n\n14:22.500 --> 14:24.820\n is when you are going to be sleepiest.\n\n14:24.820 --> 14:27.220\n There's actually a period within that 24 hour cycle,\n\n14:27.220 --> 14:29.860\n it's a time point called your temperature minimum.\n\n14:29.860 --> 14:33.860\n And your temperature minimum tends to be about two hours\n\n14:33.860 --> 14:36.180\n before your typical wake up time.\n\n14:36.180 --> 14:37.300\n I'm not talking about the wake up time\n\n14:37.300 --> 14:39.020\n in the middle of the night where you go use the bathroom\n\n14:39.020 --> 14:40.580\n or where you set an alarm to go catch a flight.\n\n14:40.580 --> 14:42.200\n I mean, if you were to just allow yourself\n\n14:42.200 --> 14:44.740\n to sleep without a clock for a few days,\n\n14:44.740 --> 14:46.260\n measure when you typically wake up,\n\n14:46.260 --> 14:48.620\n two hours before then is your temperature minimum.\n\n14:48.620 --> 14:50.540\n And that temperature minimum turns out to be\n\n14:50.540 --> 14:54.820\n a very important landmark in your circadian cycle\n\n14:54.820 --> 14:59.180\n because it turns out that if you get bright light\n\n14:59.180 --> 15:02.740\n in your eyes in the hours immediately\n\n15:02.740 --> 15:04.520\n before your temperature minimum,\n\n15:05.500 --> 15:09.180\n so two to four hours or anytime within the two\n\n15:09.180 --> 15:11.120\n or four hour window before that temperature minimum,\n\n15:11.120 --> 15:14.340\n you are going to what's called delay your circadian clock.\n\n15:14.340 --> 15:16.480\n The next day, that whole oscillation\n\n15:16.480 --> 15:18.060\n is going to move forward.\n\n15:18.060 --> 15:21.000\n It'll make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.780\n Whereas if you get bright light in your eyes\n\n15:22.780 --> 15:26.140\n in the hours after that temperature minimum,\n\n15:26.140 --> 15:28.660\n so let's say for me, typical wake up time is 6 a.m.,\n\n15:28.660 --> 15:30.780\n my temperature minimum somewhere around 4 a.m.\n\n15:30.780 --> 15:34.560\n If I get bright light in my eyes, 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 7 a.m.,\n\n15:34.560 --> 15:37.580\n it's going to advance that oscillation\n\n15:37.580 --> 15:39.260\n so that I'll want to go to bed earlier\n\n15:39.260 --> 15:41.780\n and wake up earlier the subsequent nights.\n\n15:41.780 --> 15:44.100\n So you might say, wait, but most nights\n\n15:44.100 --> 15:46.380\n I go to sleep and wake up at more or less the same time.\n\n15:46.380 --> 15:47.220\n Why is that?\n\n15:47.220 --> 15:48.860\n And that's because the same thing\n\n15:48.860 --> 15:49.980\n is happening on both sides.\n\n15:49.980 --> 15:52.180\n You are both advancing your clock a little bit\n\n15:52.180 --> 15:55.140\n and assuming that you're looking at light in the evening,\n\n15:55.140 --> 15:57.100\n you're also delaying your clock a little bit.\n\n15:57.100 --> 15:58.660\n So you get kind of captured in between\n\n15:58.660 --> 16:01.140\n and then your rhythm more or less oscillates\n\n16:01.140 --> 16:05.020\n at the same period, as we say, as the spin of the earth.\n\n16:05.020 --> 16:07.020\n Unless you're like you where you're,\n\n16:07.020 --> 16:10.140\n I get text messages from you sometimes at odd hours\n\n16:10.140 --> 16:12.060\n and if you're on the East Coast,\n\n16:12.060 --> 16:14.180\n then I know that you had to have been pulling\n\n16:14.180 --> 16:15.020\n basically an all nighter.\n\n16:15.020 --> 16:18.340\n Yeah, yeah, that's the interesting point\n\n16:18.340 --> 16:21.420\n about the messiness of sleep.\n\n16:21.420 --> 16:24.300\n So most people seem to perform the best\n\n16:24.300 --> 16:26.600\n when they have like a regular sleep schedule.\n\n16:28.060 --> 16:32.420\n I perhaps am the same, but I don't know that.\n\n16:32.420 --> 16:36.700\n And I tend to believe that you can also perform\n\n16:36.700 --> 16:40.840\n relatively optimally with chaos of sleep,\n\n16:40.840 --> 16:45.840\n of like a weird soup of like power naps\n\n16:47.500 --> 16:49.540\n and all nighters and all of that,\n\n16:49.540 --> 16:54.540\n as long as you're like happy doing what you love.\n\n16:56.060 --> 17:01.060\n And maybe you can tell me what you think about this.\n\n17:01.780 --> 17:06.540\n So I tend to, for myself, try to minimize stress in life.\n\n17:06.540 --> 17:10.780\n So what I found for myself with diet,\n\n17:10.780 --> 17:15.420\n with sleep is that if I obsess about it being perfect,\n\n17:15.420 --> 17:18.620\n then I'll actually stress quite a bit when it's not.\n\n17:18.620 --> 17:23.620\n Like I'll feel shitty when I don't get enough sleep\n\n17:24.460 --> 17:27.420\n because I know I should be getting more sleep\n\n17:27.420 --> 17:30.600\n as opposed to the actual physiological effects\n\n17:30.600 --> 17:32.200\n of not getting enough sleep.\n\n17:32.200 --> 17:35.100\n I find if I just accept whatever the hell happens,\n\n17:35.100 --> 17:39.420\n happens and smile and just take it all in,\n\n17:39.420 --> 17:42.620\n like David Goggins style, like if it sucks,\n\n17:42.620 --> 17:45.180\n it's even better or what is it,\n\n17:45.180 --> 17:47.300\n Jocko's like good or whatever he says.\n\n17:47.300 --> 17:49.900\n I think there are several things\n\n17:49.900 --> 17:51.060\n that you said that are important,\n\n17:51.060 --> 17:55.760\n but I agree that one can have a dysregulated sleep schedule\n\n17:55.760 --> 17:58.420\n and still be a happy person and productive.\n\n17:58.420 --> 18:00.200\n Much of my life, I've pulled all nighters\n\n18:00.200 --> 18:03.220\n and slept weird schedules.\n\n18:03.220 --> 18:06.520\n I think many people can probably relate to going to sleep,\n\n18:06.520 --> 18:08.820\n waking up four hours later, being up for an hour or two\n\n18:08.820 --> 18:10.260\n on your computer, then going back to sleep\n\n18:10.260 --> 18:12.860\n and getting amazing sleep the next day functioning.\n\n18:12.860 --> 18:17.020\n I think it's important that people have highlighted\n\n18:17.020 --> 18:20.880\n the importance of sleep and getting enough rest.\n\n18:20.880 --> 18:22.960\n I do think it's gone too far\n\n18:22.960 --> 18:24.580\n and now I'm editorializing a little bit,\n\n18:24.580 --> 18:28.540\n but I think that we've created this anxiety about sleep\n\n18:28.540 --> 18:30.820\n that if we don't sleep enough, we're going to get dementia.\n\n18:30.820 --> 18:31.660\n If we don't get sleep,\n\n18:31.660 --> 18:36.200\n then the reproductive access is going to completely crash.\n\n18:36.200 --> 18:40.700\n There's a lot of evidence to the contrary and as well,\n\n18:40.700 --> 18:42.240\n just based on personal experience\n\n18:42.240 --> 18:44.680\n and based on the fact that sure,\n\n18:44.680 --> 18:46.760\n it may be that a solid eight hours\n\n18:46.760 --> 18:50.480\n with no interruptions in there or nine or 10\n\n18:50.480 --> 18:51.660\n could do great benefit,\n\n18:51.660 --> 18:54.460\n but you can do really well if you do what you say,\n\n18:54.460 --> 18:55.960\n which is you wake up,\n\n18:55.960 --> 18:57.500\n you don't want to start stressing about it,\n\n18:57.500 --> 19:00.020\n creating this meta stress about sleep.\n\n19:00.020 --> 19:04.240\n Being happy is actually one of the most powerful things\n\n19:04.240 --> 19:05.080\n that you can do,\n\n19:05.080 --> 19:07.720\n allowing yourself to go down that rabbit hole of stress\n\n19:07.720 --> 19:08.920\n for the following reason.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.140\n A lot of our fatigue is not due just to the buildup\n\n19:13.140 --> 19:14.880\n of adenosine or time of day,\n\n19:14.880 --> 19:16.500\n the circadian thing we were talking about earlier.\n\n19:16.500 --> 19:21.420\n An additional factor is that effort is related\n\n19:21.420 --> 19:22.600\n to the release of epinephrine,\n\n19:22.600 --> 19:24.400\n of adrenaline in our brain and body.\n\n19:25.360 --> 19:28.720\n At some point, those levels get so high\n\n19:28.720 --> 19:32.280\n that we get stressed mentally,\n\n19:32.280 --> 19:34.400\n we get stressed physically and we want to give up.\n\n19:34.400 --> 19:36.200\n There are good data published in Cell\n\n19:36.200 --> 19:39.240\n showing that that signal, the epinephrine signal,\n\n19:39.240 --> 19:42.080\n eventually accumulates and there's a quit point.\n\n19:42.080 --> 19:45.360\n Dopamine, the molecule of pursuit and reward\n\n19:45.360 --> 19:49.820\n and feeling good, resets our ability to be in effort.\n\n19:49.820 --> 19:52.240\n In fact, a lot of people don't know this,\n\n19:52.240 --> 19:56.640\n but dopamine is actually what epinephrine is made from.\n\n19:56.640 --> 19:58.260\n If you look at the biochemical cascade,\n\n19:58.260 --> 19:59.540\n it starts with tyrosine,\n\n19:59.540 --> 20:03.240\n which is found in red meats and things of that sort.\n\n20:03.240 --> 20:05.200\n And tyrosine is eventually converted\n\n20:05.200 --> 20:07.480\n through things like L dopa into dopamine.\n\n20:07.480 --> 20:09.440\n Dopamine is made into epinephrine.\n\n20:09.440 --> 20:11.760\n So, I mean, this sounds kind of new agey,\n\n20:11.760 --> 20:16.120\n but happiness, joy and pleasure in what you're doing\n\n20:16.120 --> 20:20.340\n creates a chemical milieu that provides more\n\n20:20.340 --> 20:22.840\n of the chemicals that allow for effort.\n\n20:22.840 --> 20:24.240\n And there's nothing new agey about that.\n\n20:24.240 --> 20:26.080\n It's in every biochemistry textbook.\n\n20:26.080 --> 20:28.140\n It's in every decent neuroscience textbook.\n\n20:28.140 --> 20:29.600\n They just don't talk about the happiness part.\n\n20:29.600 --> 20:31.400\n They just talk about the dopamine part.\n\n20:31.400 --> 20:33.400\n So, I think that limiting your stress\n\n20:33.400 --> 20:35.200\n and at least recognizing, okay,\n\n20:35.200 --> 20:36.240\n if you're pulling an all nighter\n\n20:36.240 --> 20:38.480\n or you're somehow on messed up sleep,\n\n20:39.580 --> 20:43.360\n that there is going to be a point in that 24 hour cycle\n\n20:43.360 --> 20:46.060\n where your brain is not trustworthy,\n\n20:46.060 --> 20:50.700\n where your mental state is not worth placing too much weight\n\n20:50.700 --> 20:53.360\n on because you are near that temperature minimum.\n\n20:53.360 --> 20:54.880\n And near that temperature minimum,\n\n20:54.880 --> 20:57.280\n which is correlates to that two hour,\n\n20:57.280 --> 21:00.360\n about two hours before you would normally wake up,\n\n21:00.360 --> 21:03.860\n the brain is hobbling along.\n\n21:03.860 --> 21:06.880\n And anything you feel or think at that time\n\n21:06.880 --> 21:09.420\n should not be given too much value.\n\n21:09.420 --> 21:11.760\n But if you can trick yourself into thinking\n\n21:11.760 --> 21:13.260\n that's the pleasure point,\n\n21:13.260 --> 21:15.240\n you afford yourself a huge advantage.\n\n21:15.240 --> 21:17.600\n There's a study done by a colleague of mine at Stanford\n\n21:17.600 --> 21:20.560\n that showed that positive anticipation\n\n21:20.560 --> 21:25.560\n about the next day events actually is a powerful metric\n\n21:26.320 --> 21:29.400\n for creating quality sleep,\n\n21:29.400 --> 21:31.640\n even if the sleep is very reduced.\n\n21:31.640 --> 21:32.960\n And you'll love this one.\n\n21:32.960 --> 21:35.040\n And a lot of people are going to,\n\n21:35.040 --> 21:36.000\n might be critical of this.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:36.920\n So, I just want to make sure that,\n\n21:36.920 --> 21:40.040\n so this is work done out of Harvard Medical.\n\n21:40.040 --> 21:42.720\n It was Bob Stickgold's lab\n\n21:42.720 --> 21:45.960\n and Emily Hoagland did this study that showed\n\n21:45.960 --> 21:48.840\n looking at Ochem, performance on Ochem scores.\n\n21:48.840 --> 21:50.080\n Okay, so organic chemistry at Harvard\n\n21:50.080 --> 21:52.600\n is pretty tough subject, highly motivated,\n\n21:52.600 --> 21:55.960\n a number of very good control groups in this study.\n\n21:55.960 --> 22:00.000\n What she showed was that consistency of total sleep duration\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:04.200\n was far more important for performance on these exams\n\n22:04.200 --> 22:06.800\n than total sleep duration itself.\n\n22:06.800 --> 22:08.720\n So it's not that just getting more sleep\n\n22:08.720 --> 22:10.280\n allows you to perform better.\n\n22:10.280 --> 22:13.680\n Consistently getting about the same amount of sleep\n\n22:13.680 --> 22:17.720\n is better for performance, at least on Ochem,\n\n22:17.720 --> 22:19.780\n than just getting more.\n\n22:19.780 --> 22:20.620\n That's interesting.\n\n22:20.620 --> 22:22.800\n So that's referring to more\n\n22:22.800 --> 22:25.440\n that there should be a consistent habit\n\n22:25.440 --> 22:27.880\n versus the total amount.\n\n22:27.880 --> 22:31.160\n To me, like the entirety of the picture of sleep\n\n22:31.160 --> 22:36.160\n is similar to nutrition in that it feels like it's,\n\n22:38.400 --> 22:40.040\n there's so many variables involved\n\n22:40.040 --> 22:42.360\n and it's so person specific.\n\n22:42.360 --> 22:44.400\n So, you know, a lot of studies,\n\n22:44.400 --> 22:45.920\n I mean, this is the way of science,\n\n22:45.920 --> 22:49.520\n has to look in aggregate the effects on sleep.\n\n22:49.520 --> 22:52.400\n It doesn't focus on high performers\n\n22:52.400 --> 22:54.620\n which are individuals ultimately.\n\n22:54.620 --> 22:57.000\n Like the question isn't,\n\n22:57.960 --> 22:59.200\n so it's a very important question,\n\n22:59.200 --> 23:04.200\n is like what kind of diet fights obesity, reduces obesity?\n\n23:04.280 --> 23:05.440\n It's another question,\n\n23:05.440 --> 23:07.760\n what kind of diet allows David Goggins\n\n23:07.760 --> 23:09.240\n to be the best version of himself?\n\n23:09.240 --> 23:11.800\n So these high performers in different avenues.\n\n23:11.800 --> 23:13.180\n And the same thing with sleep,\n\n23:13.180 --> 23:15.640\n like people that tell me\n\n23:15.640 --> 23:17.640\n that I should get eight hours of sleep,\n\n23:18.560 --> 23:23.420\n it's like, it's, I mean, I get it\n\n23:23.420 --> 23:26.320\n and there may be right, but they may be very wrong.\n\n23:26.320 --> 23:29.500\n There's no evidence that eight is better than six,\n\n23:29.500 --> 23:33.440\n that you could very well do better on six than on eight.\n\n23:33.440 --> 23:36.140\n There are a few other things that turn out to be\n\n23:36.140 --> 23:38.440\n strong parameters for success in this domain.\n\n23:38.440 --> 23:42.160\n For instance, your entire life, waking or asleep\n\n23:42.160 --> 23:44.760\n is broken up into these 90 minute ultradian cycles.\n\n23:44.760 --> 23:47.520\n If you look at ability to attend or do math problems\n\n23:47.520 --> 23:50.060\n or do anything, you know, drive,\n\n23:50.060 --> 23:54.020\n performance tends to ramp up slowly within a 90 minute cycle\n\n23:54.020 --> 23:56.720\n peak and then come down at the end of that 90 minute cycle.\n\n23:56.720 --> 23:59.920\n And in sleep, we go through these stage one, two, three,\n\n23:59.920 --> 24:02.420\n four REM, et cetera, we'll talk more about that if you like,\n\n24:02.420 --> 24:05.440\n those on 90 minute ultradian cycles as well.\n\n24:05.440 --> 24:07.940\n Ending your sleep after a 90 minute cycle\n\n24:07.940 --> 24:10.820\n at the near the end of a 90 minute cycle,\n\n24:10.820 --> 24:12.500\n say at the end of six hours,\n\n24:12.500 --> 24:14.960\n in many cases is better for you\n\n24:14.960 --> 24:17.160\n than sleeping an additional hour, seven hours\n\n24:17.160 --> 24:19.320\n and waking up in the middle of an ultradian cycle.\n\n24:19.320 --> 24:21.200\n And there are a few apps that can measure this\n\n24:21.200 --> 24:23.240\n based on body movements and things like that,\n\n24:23.240 --> 24:25.800\n that have your alarm go off\n\n24:25.800 --> 24:27.880\n at the end of an ultradian cycle.\n\n24:27.880 --> 24:30.500\n And if you wake up in the middle of an ultradian cycle,\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:32.600\n sometimes not always you can be very groggy\n\n24:32.600 --> 24:34.260\n for a long period of time.\n\n24:34.260 --> 24:37.560\n I certainly do better on six hours than I do on seven.\n\n24:37.560 --> 24:40.580\n I happen to like an eight hour sleep, it feels great,\n\n24:40.580 --> 24:43.020\n but I haven't slept an entire eight hours\n\n24:43.020 --> 24:45.180\n without waking up in the middle of the night at some point\n\n24:45.180 --> 24:48.000\n in, I don't know, forever.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.640\n I can't remember, it's probably some point in infancy.\n\n24:51.640 --> 24:53.120\n And I function well during the day.\n\n24:53.120 --> 24:57.220\n I think that that's an important parameter\n\n24:57.220 --> 24:58.940\n is how do you feel during the day?\n\n24:58.940 --> 25:02.040\n Almost everybody experiences some sort of dip in energy\n\n25:02.040 --> 25:03.000\n in the late afternoon\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.160\n or what would correlate to their temperature peak.\n\n25:05.160 --> 25:06.680\n And that's a good time of day\n\n25:06.680 --> 25:10.560\n to get either a 90 minute or less nap,\n\n25:10.560 --> 25:13.960\n or if you're not a napper or you can't nap,\n\n25:13.960 --> 25:18.960\n feet elevated has been shown to be good for clear out\n\n25:19.040 --> 25:22.080\n of some of this, the glymphatic system\n\n25:22.080 --> 25:23.560\n is this kind of like sewer system of the brain\n\n25:23.560 --> 25:24.760\n that you can clear stuff out.\n\n25:24.760 --> 25:29.080\n So legs elevated, or one thing that I'm a big proponent of\n\n25:29.080 --> 25:30.200\n and that my lab has been studying\n\n25:30.200 --> 25:34.300\n is what I now call NSDR, non sleep deep rest.\n\n25:34.300 --> 25:36.360\n And this is just lying down.\n\n25:36.360 --> 25:38.480\n There are some scripts that we're gonna put out there soon\n\n25:38.480 --> 25:40.060\n as a free resource.\n\n25:40.060 --> 25:41.280\n There's some hypnosis scripts\n\n25:41.280 --> 25:42.840\n that my colleague David Spiegel has put out there\n\n25:42.840 --> 25:44.080\n as a free resource,\n\n25:44.080 --> 25:46.640\n but non sleep deep rest is allowing your system\n\n25:46.640 --> 25:49.940\n to drop into states of a real calm\n\n25:49.940 --> 25:52.480\n that allow you to get better at falling asleep later.\n\n25:52.480 --> 25:53.820\n And they can be very restorative\n\n25:53.820 --> 25:55.620\n for cognitive and motor function.\n\n25:55.620 --> 25:58.040\n There's at least one study out of Denmark\n\n25:58.040 --> 26:01.360\n that shows that the basal ganglia,\n\n26:01.360 --> 26:02.320\n which is an area of the brain\n\n26:02.320 --> 26:04.300\n that's involved in motor planning and action,\n\n26:04.300 --> 26:07.380\n one of these 20 minute non sleep deep rest protocols\n\n26:07.380 --> 26:09.280\n resets levels of neuromodulators\n\n26:09.280 --> 26:10.820\n like dopamine and the basal ganglia\n\n26:10.820 --> 26:13.220\n to the same levels that they were\n\n26:13.220 --> 26:15.280\n right after a long night's sleep.\n\n26:15.280 --> 26:20.280\n So I also respectfully or semi respectfully disagree\n\n26:20.440 --> 26:23.120\n with the idea that you can't recover lost sleep.\n\n26:23.120 --> 26:24.080\n What does that mean?\n\n26:24.080 --> 26:26.200\n I mean, there's no IRS for sleep.\n\n26:26.200 --> 26:29.220\n So what does it mean to be in debt for sleep?\n\n26:29.220 --> 26:31.800\n If you're falling asleep during the day and you're sleepy,\n\n26:31.800 --> 26:35.280\n like you're falling asleep, that's a good sign of insomnia.\n\n26:35.280 --> 26:37.040\n It means you're not sleeping enough at night.\n\n26:37.040 --> 26:38.720\n If you're fatigued during the day,\n\n26:38.720 --> 26:40.240\n but you're not falling asleep,\n\n26:40.240 --> 26:41.360\n so you're just exhausted,\n\n26:41.360 --> 26:43.560\n but you're not finding yourself falling asleep in meetings\n\n26:43.560 --> 26:45.080\n and in conversation,\n\n26:45.080 --> 26:47.900\n then chances are you're fatiguing your system\n\n26:47.900 --> 26:48.840\n through something else,\n\n26:48.840 --> 26:52.600\n like a long run in the middle of the night in Austin\n\n26:52.600 --> 26:55.500\n or whatever it is that you're up to lately at 3 a.m.\n\n26:55.500 --> 26:58.040\n Yes, there is a magic to the nap.\n\n26:58.040 --> 27:01.400\n And maybe you could speak to the,\n\n27:01.400 --> 27:03.020\n because you mentioned these protocols\n\n27:03.020 --> 27:06.840\n that don't necessarily, so they're non sleep.\n\n27:06.840 --> 27:11.840\n But to me, the nap one or two a day\n\n27:13.080 --> 27:16.400\n can almost irrespective of how much sleep\n\n27:16.400 --> 27:17.760\n I get the night before,\n\n27:18.620 --> 27:22.200\n have a fundamental change in my mood, in my performance.\n\n27:22.200 --> 27:23.040\n For the better or for the worse?\n\n27:23.040 --> 27:24.040\n For the better, for the better.\n\n27:24.040 --> 27:24.960\n Yeah, likewise.\n\n27:24.960 --> 27:29.780\n So I do tend to kind of experiment with durations.\n\n27:29.780 --> 27:33.520\n It's consistently surprising to me\n\n27:33.520 --> 27:36.640\n how like a nap of like 10 minutes,\n\n27:36.640 --> 27:37.640\n I don't know, maybe you can speak\n\n27:37.640 --> 27:39.700\n to the perfect duration of a nap,\n\n27:39.700 --> 27:43.120\n but I find that it's like magic\n\n27:43.120 --> 27:46.800\n that a short nap does as much good\n\n27:46.800 --> 27:50.200\n and often better than a longer one, for me, for me,\n\n27:50.200 --> 27:51.040\n subjectively speaking.\n\n27:51.040 --> 27:51.960\n What would be a longer one?\n\n27:51.960 --> 27:53.360\n Longer than 90 minutes?\n\n27:53.360 --> 27:54.880\n No, no, like 90 minutes,\n\n27:54.880 --> 27:57.080\n or a bit longer than 90 minutes, like two hours.\n\n27:57.080 --> 27:59.780\n Yeah, that's starting to drop you into REM sleep.\n\n27:59.780 --> 28:01.920\n And even if it's a tiny amount of REM sleep,\n\n28:01.920 --> 28:04.680\n people can come out of those naps kind of disoriented.\n\n28:04.680 --> 28:07.160\n I mean, remember, in sleep, space and time\n\n28:07.160 --> 28:08.280\n are totally uncoupled.\n\n28:08.280 --> 28:12.400\n And so that's an odd state to reenter the world in\n\n28:12.400 --> 28:13.960\n if you're not gonna stay there for a while,\n\n28:13.960 --> 28:15.240\n like for a good night's sleep.\n\n28:15.240 --> 28:18.920\n I think a 20 minute nap is pretty fantastic.\n\n28:18.920 --> 28:19.940\n Would you say that's the,\n\n28:19.940 --> 28:21.960\n if you were to recommend to the general,\n\n28:21.960 --> 28:24.720\n it's very weird to recommend anything\n\n28:24.720 --> 28:25.920\n to the general populace,\n\n28:25.920 --> 28:28.440\n because obviously it's very person specific,\n\n28:28.440 --> 28:31.440\n but what's a good one will you say to friends?\n\n28:31.440 --> 28:32.800\n Is 20 minutes a good powder?\n\n28:32.800 --> 28:34.140\n 20 or 30 minutes.\n\n28:34.140 --> 28:34.980\n 20 or 30 minutes,\n\n28:34.980 --> 28:37.400\n because you're going, unless you're sleep deprived,\n\n28:37.400 --> 28:40.080\n you're going to stay out of REM sleep,\n\n28:40.080 --> 28:41.160\n rapid eye movement sleep.\n\n28:41.160 --> 28:43.120\n If you're sleep deprived, you'll drop right into it.\n\n28:43.120 --> 28:45.080\n If you've ever traveled and you're really jet lagged,\n\n28:45.080 --> 28:46.960\n you go to the hotel, you lay down for one second,\n\n28:46.960 --> 28:48.840\n all of a sudden you're just like,\n\n28:48.840 --> 28:51.460\n you're in a psychedelic dream,\n\n28:52.340 --> 28:54.160\n which can be pretty great too.\n\n28:55.280 --> 28:58.360\n But I think that 20, 30 minutes,\n\n28:58.360 --> 29:01.840\n and if you can't sleep, some people have trouble napping,\n\n29:01.840 --> 29:03.760\n then learning to relax the body\n\n29:03.760 --> 29:04.760\n as much as possible,\n\n29:04.760 --> 29:07.160\n like trying to remove all expression from your face,\n\n29:07.160 --> 29:10.080\n completely letting your body kind of float.\n\n29:10.080 --> 29:13.360\n If people have a hard time relaxing when they're awake,\n\n29:13.360 --> 29:15.680\n there's some terrific clinically\n\n29:15.680 --> 29:18.480\n and research tested hypnosis protocols\n\n29:18.480 --> 29:21.000\n that we could provide links to that are cost free\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.300\n and that teach you how to just completely\n\n29:24.520 --> 29:28.000\n release the alertness button and you just start drifting.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:31.160\n Now, the problem is if you don't have an alarm\n\n29:31.160 --> 29:32.720\n or something to go off,\n\n29:32.720 --> 29:34.080\n the other day I did one\n\n29:34.080 --> 29:35.760\n and I'm almost embarrassed to say this,\n\n29:35.760 --> 29:36.680\n but there's a component of it\n\n29:36.680 --> 29:38.560\n where you actually are supposed to let your hand float up\n\n29:38.560 --> 29:40.480\n because it's a hypnosis script.\n\n29:40.480 --> 29:43.160\n So they, it's my colleague, David Spiegel in the script,\n\n29:43.160 --> 29:46.140\n he says, let your hand float up.\n\n29:46.140 --> 29:49.000\n I woke up an hour later and my hand was still floating.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:52.160\n Yeah, and I was completely relaxed.\n\n29:52.160 --> 29:56.620\n So hypnosis is just a matter of going deep relaxation,\n\n29:56.620 --> 29:59.560\n narrowing of context, and it's all self imposed.\n\n29:59.560 --> 30:01.960\n A lot of people think that hypnosis is like the stage thing\n\n30:01.960 --> 30:03.920\n with the pendant and the chicken,\n\n30:03.920 --> 30:05.720\n people fucking like chickens,\n\n30:05.720 --> 30:08.660\n but real hypnosis is self hypnosis.\n\n30:08.660 --> 30:11.560\n You're learning to, it involves some shifts\n\n30:11.560 --> 30:14.220\n in the way that you, the hypnotic induction involves\n\n30:14.220 --> 30:16.760\n looking up, closing your eyes, slowly deep breath,\n\n30:16.760 --> 30:19.200\n and then imagine yourself floating.\n\n30:19.200 --> 30:23.040\n And people vary on a scale of about one to four,\n\n30:23.040 --> 30:25.640\n four being the most easily hypnotized.\n\n30:25.640 --> 30:27.440\n There are a few people who it's very hard for them\n\n30:27.440 --> 30:29.920\n to allow themselves to go into these states,\n\n30:29.920 --> 30:33.000\n but for most people, they just, they're gone.\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:36.380\n And it's nice if you can have access to those states,\n\n30:36.380 --> 30:39.320\n because when you come out of it, you feel amazing.\n\n30:39.320 --> 30:40.720\n You feel like you slept the whole night,\n\n30:40.720 --> 30:42.600\n at least most people report that.\n\n30:42.600 --> 30:43.880\n So refresh, alert.\n\n30:43.880 --> 30:44.720\n Ready to go.\n\n30:44.720 --> 30:46.520\n I mean, basically you're ready.\n\n30:46.520 --> 30:49.600\n Yeah, I know you have this interesting challenge coming up\n\n30:49.600 --> 30:51.560\n and I'm curious what you're going to do to reset\n\n30:51.560 --> 30:55.860\n in the hours, the frequency of running is every four hours.\n\n30:55.860 --> 30:57.460\n It's not going to allow you to get any more\n\n30:57.460 --> 30:59.360\n than a couple hours sleep in between.\n\n30:59.360 --> 31:00.200\n Couple hours.\n\n31:00.200 --> 31:01.160\n So we should tell it to people.\n\n31:01.160 --> 31:03.800\n I'd be curious to get your thoughts and advice on it.\n\n31:03.800 --> 31:08.800\n I'm on March 5th, running 48 miles with Mr. David Goggins.\n\n31:10.280 --> 31:14.680\n So four miles every four hours and people should join us.\n\n31:14.680 --> 31:19.280\n He's, that mad man is going to be live on Instagram\n\n31:19.280 --> 31:23.360\n starting at 8 p.m. Pacific on March 5th.\n\n31:23.360 --> 31:24.200\n So.\n\n31:24.200 --> 31:25.100\n You're going to join him in person.\n\n31:25.100 --> 31:26.020\n In person.\n\n31:26.020 --> 31:27.200\n Undisclosed location.\n\n31:27.200 --> 31:28.960\n Undisclosed location.\n\n31:28.960 --> 31:31.040\n And I was trying to clarify like, okay,\n\n31:31.040 --> 31:35.400\n so we're going to like, there'll be like friendly people\n\n31:35.400 --> 31:36.440\n around or something.\n\n31:36.440 --> 31:37.520\n No, it's just me and him.\n\n31:37.520 --> 31:38.340\n Friendly people.\n\n31:38.340 --> 31:39.180\n I don't know.\n\n31:39.180 --> 31:42.520\n Like, I just feel it's very difficult to be\n\n31:42.520 --> 31:45.600\n with David alone in a room.\n\n31:45.600 --> 31:47.760\n I imagine his, I mean, I've done some work with David.\n\n31:47.760 --> 31:49.480\n His energy is infectious.\n\n31:49.480 --> 31:50.360\n Yeah.\n\n31:50.360 --> 31:52.180\n That's an intense schedule.\n\n31:53.040 --> 31:56.160\n And the periodicity of those four hour,\n\n31:56.160 --> 31:58.240\n every four hours, four miles means\n\n31:58.240 --> 31:59.600\n that there's no chance of catching\n\n31:59.600 --> 32:01.760\n an extended block of sleep.\n\n32:01.760 --> 32:04.120\n So it's about three hours that you have\n\n32:04.120 --> 32:05.680\n non exercising every time.\n\n32:05.680 --> 32:09.960\n And of course, it takes time to try to fall asleep\n\n32:09.960 --> 32:11.800\n and there's an intensity to the whole thing.\n\n32:11.800 --> 32:16.800\n I mean, it's probably impossible to get anything more\n\n32:17.020 --> 32:19.860\n than two hours of sleep if you wanted to.\n\n32:19.860 --> 32:23.200\n So the optimal thing is probably from the sound of it,\n\n32:23.200 --> 32:25.280\n I'd be curious to see what you think,\n\n32:25.280 --> 32:29.160\n but like it's getting a few 90 minute naps.\n\n32:29.160 --> 32:31.440\n Okay, well, I thought about this a bit\n\n32:31.440 --> 32:33.440\n before we met up today.\n\n32:33.440 --> 32:35.800\n So I think there are two general approaches\n\n32:35.800 --> 32:37.480\n that could work.\n\n32:37.480 --> 32:40.300\n Neither one necessarily better than the other.\n\n32:40.300 --> 32:44.800\n One would be just to hammer through the whole thing,\n\n32:44.800 --> 32:49.320\n just to get your level of alertness and adrenaline ramped up\n\n32:49.320 --> 32:52.320\n so that you don't expect yourself to sleep.\n\n32:52.320 --> 32:53.680\n There are certain advantages there.\n\n32:53.680 --> 32:56.240\n One is a subjective kind of emotional advantages,\n\n32:56.240 --> 32:57.440\n which is if you can't sleep,\n\n32:57.440 --> 32:59.520\n you're not gonna be stressed about that.\n\n32:59.520 --> 33:01.800\n And if you do fall asleep, it's a bonus,\n\n33:01.800 --> 33:03.520\n provided you wake up and you don't look up\n\n33:03.520 --> 33:06.120\n and you realize David's been out running for half an hour\n\n33:06.120 --> 33:07.480\n and you're behind, right?\n\n33:07.480 --> 33:09.100\n But chances are, that's not the way it'll go.\n\n33:09.100 --> 33:09.940\n You set an alarm.\n\n33:09.940 --> 33:11.440\n So that's one approach.\n\n33:12.640 --> 33:15.760\n And I grabbed that from a couple of friends\n\n33:15.760 --> 33:18.880\n who were in the SEAL teams and they'll say that,\n\n33:18.880 --> 33:20.720\n during BUDS, there's this infamous hell week\n\n33:20.720 --> 33:23.040\n and there's this five days,\n\n33:23.040 --> 33:25.040\n definitely five days of no sleep,\n\n33:25.040 --> 33:27.320\n although there is a component where they offer a nap\n\n33:27.320 --> 33:29.200\n at one particular point.\n\n33:29.200 --> 33:32.680\n And a lot of people will say that it's worse\n\n33:32.680 --> 33:36.480\n to go down for that nap and then be woken up 20 minutes later\n\n33:36.480 --> 33:38.560\n than to just stay up.\n\n33:38.560 --> 33:39.620\n So that's one option.\n\n33:39.620 --> 33:43.420\n Let's call it the full blitz hammer through option.\n\n33:43.420 --> 33:45.320\n And if you happen to fall asleep, you do.\n\n33:45.320 --> 33:46.920\n It's a bonus.\n\n33:46.920 --> 33:49.880\n The other one would be to really anchor\n\n33:49.880 --> 33:51.120\n in these ultradian cycles.\n\n33:51.120 --> 33:52.940\n So coming back from a run,\n\n33:52.940 --> 33:55.440\n unless you're thoroughly exhausted,\n\n33:55.440 --> 33:56.860\n you're probably going to have a few minutes\n\n33:56.860 --> 33:58.760\n where you're going to want to stay awake.\n\n33:58.760 --> 34:01.340\n It's going to be hard to just immediately fall asleep.\n\n34:01.340 --> 34:04.040\n And getting as much sleep as you can\n\n34:04.040 --> 34:06.140\n in the intervening periods,\n\n34:06.140 --> 34:08.640\n provided that you guys aren't posting constantly\n\n34:08.640 --> 34:10.080\n or doing something else.\n\n34:10.080 --> 34:11.780\n There's a question of whether or not you want to nourish,\n\n34:11.780 --> 34:14.560\n whether or not you want to eat or not in that time.\n\n34:14.560 --> 34:16.320\n Anytime we put food in our gut,\n\n34:16.320 --> 34:20.320\n I don't care if it's meat or oatmeal\n\n34:20.320 --> 34:22.640\n or broccoli or cardboard,\n\n34:22.640 --> 34:24.440\n you're drawing blood into the gut.\n\n34:24.440 --> 34:27.200\n And so you are going to divert some energy\n\n34:27.200 --> 34:29.320\n towards digestion and it's going to make you sleepy.\n\n34:29.320 --> 34:31.080\n There's a reason why the rest and digest,\n\n34:31.080 --> 34:33.560\n the parasympathetic nervous system is called that.\n\n34:33.560 --> 34:36.840\n So you could decide that you were only going to sleep\n\n34:36.840 --> 34:39.720\n in between certain blocks.\n\n34:39.720 --> 34:42.760\n That would be another way to think about this.\n\n34:42.760 --> 34:45.240\n Because I did this last year.\n\n34:45.240 --> 34:47.260\n I ran very slow.\n\n34:47.260 --> 34:48.460\n Some of it was walking.\n\n34:48.460 --> 34:49.520\n I was listening to audio books.\n\n34:49.520 --> 34:53.120\n And one of the biggest mistakes I did is to overeat\n\n34:53.120 --> 34:54.160\n during that time.\n\n34:54.160 --> 34:56.440\n It made the experience very unpleasant.\n\n34:56.440 --> 35:00.220\n So I have been considering basically eating almost nothing\n\n35:00.220 --> 35:01.360\n throughout the day.\n\n35:01.360 --> 35:03.520\n Being fasted will increase alertness\n\n35:03.520 --> 35:05.960\n because high levels of epinephrine in your system\n\n35:05.960 --> 35:07.020\n from fasting.\n\n35:07.020 --> 35:09.500\n You just think about fasting or being thirsty\n\n35:09.500 --> 35:10.800\n before you get exhausted.\n\n35:10.800 --> 35:12.840\n People always think if I don't eat, I'm going to be tired.\n\n35:12.840 --> 35:15.800\n No, the energy that you derive from food\n\n35:15.800 --> 35:19.600\n is going to be used from glycogen after a long storage\n\n35:19.600 --> 35:20.560\n and conversion process.\n\n35:20.560 --> 35:23.440\n So the food that you eat is going to consume energy\n\n35:23.440 --> 35:24.720\n to digest.\n\n35:24.720 --> 35:26.880\n And so a lot of people feel better fasted.\n\n35:26.880 --> 35:29.320\n And presumably throughout history,\n\n35:29.320 --> 35:31.080\n people have fasted for long periods of time\n\n35:31.080 --> 35:32.760\n and had to stay up for two or three days.\n\n35:32.760 --> 35:35.700\n And God forbid, if a family member is sick,\n\n35:35.700 --> 35:38.160\n you can stay awake in the hospital without any trouble.\n\n35:38.160 --> 35:41.480\n So that alertness system, it's all mental.\n\n35:42.680 --> 35:45.200\n Actually, and then there's a third.\n\n35:45.200 --> 35:48.880\n So you could try and sleep or take care in between.\n\n35:48.880 --> 35:51.400\n And then there's a third approach.\n\n35:51.400 --> 35:54.480\n But I didn't come up with it, but David did.\n\n35:54.480 --> 35:57.160\n So I actually texted him earlier\n\n35:57.160 --> 35:58.920\n because I had a feeling that I heard\n\n35:58.920 --> 36:01.000\n that you were going to do this challenge.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:02.680\n So I asked David.\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:08.800\n So these are David Goggins words, not mine.\n\n36:09.600 --> 36:14.040\n One, being organized is super important.\n\n36:14.040 --> 36:17.760\n Two, you want to waste as little time as possible.\n\n36:17.760 --> 36:21.400\n Three, you need to eat, sleep and rehab\n\n36:21.400 --> 36:22.760\n in as little time as possible\n\n36:22.760 --> 36:25.160\n so you can sleep as much as possible.\n\n36:25.160 --> 36:26.000\n Interesting.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.960\n By the way, this is the first time I'm reading this.\n\n36:28.960 --> 36:32.920\n Four, meal prep and gear prep, et cetera, are very important.\n\n36:32.920 --> 36:36.200\n That's consistent with everything I know about military.\n\n36:36.200 --> 36:39.600\n They don't leave too much to chance.\n\n36:39.600 --> 36:42.520\n Five, again, these are David's words.\n\n36:42.520 --> 36:45.000\n All that said, he's fucked on most all that\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.480\n because he'll be interviewing me before or after.\n\n36:47.480 --> 36:49.600\n I will also be interviewing him.\n\n36:49.600 --> 36:51.280\n Oh, shit.\n\n36:51.280 --> 36:53.000\n Five, long story short,\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.640\n the only thing that might help is a very special pill.\n\n36:55.640 --> 36:57.520\n Ooh, this is interesting.\n\n36:57.520 --> 36:59.880\n They're called SIU pills.\n\n36:59.880 --> 37:02.120\n Hard to get, but I believe he can get them.\n\n37:02.120 --> 37:04.360\n SIU stands for suck it up.\n\n37:06.040 --> 37:07.800\n Tell him to grab his balls.\n\n37:07.800 --> 37:09.360\n He will find those pills there.\n\n37:09.360 --> 37:13.160\n That's number six, all right.\n\n37:13.160 --> 37:15.680\n And then the last one, stay hard, brother.\n\n37:15.680 --> 37:16.720\n Stay hard, brother.\n\n37:17.680 --> 37:19.000\n Amen.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.080\n That was one of the other things\n\n37:21.080 --> 37:22.800\n that I think makes this challenging\n\n37:22.800 --> 37:25.920\n is that it'll be doing a podcast throughout.\n\n37:25.920 --> 37:28.640\n So first of all, I'll do a long one before and after,\n\n37:28.640 --> 37:31.960\n but also I'll have to come up\n\n37:31.960 --> 37:34.360\n with things to talk to him about.\n\n37:34.360 --> 37:39.360\n So it's a different thing to do something privately\n\n37:40.280 --> 37:41.160\n and then publicly.\n\n37:41.160 --> 37:43.040\n I know it doesn't seem that way,\n\n37:43.040 --> 37:46.560\n but one of the hardest,\n\n37:46.560 --> 37:49.400\n the hardest thing I had to do last time\n\n37:49.400 --> 37:52.440\n was to turn on the camera and talk to the camera\n\n37:52.440 --> 37:54.600\n because last time I did it,\n\n37:54.600 --> 37:57.880\n I recorded every single time I did a leg,\n\n37:57.880 --> 38:00.120\n I recorded something I'm grateful for.\n\n38:00.120 --> 38:01.800\n It's just kind of unrelated.\n\n38:01.800 --> 38:05.120\n I'm not a fan of talking about how I'm feeling\n\n38:05.120 --> 38:06.760\n or how the run is going.\n\n38:06.760 --> 38:10.400\n I want to do something totally unrelated to the run\n\n38:10.400 --> 38:12.800\n and with the run as the background,\n\n38:12.800 --> 38:14.240\n sort of something I'm grateful for\n\n38:14.240 --> 38:16.760\n or just any kind of interesting discussion.\n\n38:16.760 --> 38:20.240\n Gratitude, I mean, I hate the word hack,\n\n38:20.240 --> 38:22.680\n like, oh, it's a dopamine hack or it's a serotonin.\n\n38:22.680 --> 38:24.680\n I don't like the word hack because A,\n\n38:24.680 --> 38:27.240\n it's disrespectful to hackers who do a real thing\n\n38:27.240 --> 38:31.640\n and B, a hack implies that it's some sort of trick\n\n38:31.640 --> 38:35.080\n that you're kind of gaming the system.\n\n38:35.080 --> 38:38.000\n You know, what works is mechanism, right?\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:41.520\n Biological mechanisms were designed to work\n\n38:41.520 --> 38:44.000\n and they were selected for to work\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:45.920\n under variable conditions.\n\n38:45.920 --> 38:47.000\n And as you know, and I know,\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.360\n and we have great appreciation for the fact\n\n38:49.360 --> 38:50.880\n that the nervous system was designed\n\n38:50.880 --> 38:52.320\n to be an adaptive machine\n\n38:52.320 --> 38:55.720\n so that you don't have to sleep eight hours every night.\n\n38:55.720 --> 38:57.840\n You can do this thing.\n\n38:57.840 --> 39:00.920\n And things like gratitude allow you to tap\n\n39:00.920 --> 39:03.520\n into chemical resources.\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:04.960\n And that's not a hack.\n\n39:04.960 --> 39:07.400\n The fact that being grateful for something external\n\n39:07.400 --> 39:10.680\n to the event happens to release serotonin\n\n39:10.680 --> 39:13.720\n and have a certain soothing effect or a dopamine\n\n39:13.720 --> 39:16.920\n and give you more epinephrine and let you go further,\n\n39:16.920 --> 39:18.040\n that's not a hack.\n\n39:18.040 --> 39:21.000\n That's actually what allowed the human machine\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.160\n to evolve to the point that it is now.\n\n39:23.160 --> 39:26.280\n Every time, you know, an inventor eventually\n\n39:26.280 --> 39:28.720\n created something that worked and felt great about it,\n\n39:28.720 --> 39:31.160\n you can imagine that the first, you know,\n\n39:31.160 --> 39:33.320\n air flight felt pretty awesome\n\n39:33.320 --> 39:35.840\n and motivated those people to go on and do more.\n\n39:35.840 --> 39:39.200\n They didn't just go on, you know, yawn and go have a beer.\n\n39:39.200 --> 39:44.000\n So being able to access the genuine internal states\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.800\n of gratitude and reward works.\n\n39:46.800 --> 39:48.600\n You can't trick the system.\n\n39:48.600 --> 39:50.800\n You can't pretend that you're grateful for something,\n\n39:50.800 --> 39:52.720\n but if you can identify or attach yourself\n\n39:52.720 --> 39:55.200\n to some larger goal or something\n\n39:55.200 --> 39:57.160\n that's deeply gratifying to you,\n\n39:57.160 --> 40:00.840\n or place it in service to a relative that passed away\n\n40:00.840 --> 40:04.480\n that you care a lot about, that's not a hack.\n\n40:04.480 --> 40:07.160\n That's accessing the deepest components\n\n40:07.160 --> 40:08.360\n of your nervous system.\n\n40:08.360 --> 40:10.480\n And to steal your kind of lingo,\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:12.320\n you know, there's real beauty there, right?\n\n40:12.320 --> 40:15.920\n Yeah, but for an introvert like myself,\n\n40:15.920 --> 40:17.960\n and I think David, I don't know if he's an introvert,\n\n40:17.960 --> 40:21.960\n but like, he's not, despite the fact\n\n40:21.960 --> 40:24.720\n that he has written a great book and he communicates,\n\n40:24.720 --> 40:25.840\n he puts himself out there,\n\n40:25.840 --> 40:28.600\n he's not really a fan of communication.\n\n40:28.600 --> 40:31.280\n He's not, I don't know if he's energized\n\n40:31.280 --> 40:33.760\n by speaking his mind.\n\n40:33.760 --> 40:34.960\n I don't know him well enough to know.\n\n40:34.960 --> 40:36.800\n I mean, we've done a little bit of work together\n\n40:36.800 --> 40:38.960\n and, you know, we're in communication now and again.\n\n40:38.960 --> 40:40.560\n He's obviously super impressive.\n\n40:41.600 --> 40:42.440\n I don't know.\n\n40:42.440 --> 40:44.840\n It seems like he's a pretty private guy.\n\n40:44.840 --> 40:47.920\n Yeah, so like, you know, so I don't have access to that.\n\n40:47.920 --> 40:50.040\n So for me, I'll just speak to myself,\n\n40:50.040 --> 40:51.240\n and I think David is the same,\n\n40:51.240 --> 40:55.200\n but I'll speak to myself that it was a hugely draining thing,\n\n40:55.200 --> 40:57.920\n not to experience the gratitude,\n\n40:57.920 --> 41:00.400\n experiencing the gratitude just like you're saying\n\n41:00.400 --> 41:04.560\n is really energizing, and it's a powerful thing.\n\n41:04.560 --> 41:08.360\n It's a, it can lift up your mood.\n\n41:08.360 --> 41:12.760\n But to turn on the camera and have to use words,\n\n41:12.760 --> 41:14.160\n which is very difficult to do,\n\n41:14.160 --> 41:18.360\n to explain like what you're feeling\n\n41:18.360 --> 41:20.040\n and do it in a way that you know\n\n41:20.040 --> 41:23.640\n a bunch of people will be watching is really draining.\n\n41:23.640 --> 41:26.200\n And one of the things I'm concerned about\n\n41:26.200 --> 41:29.200\n that in this whole process,\n\n41:29.200 --> 41:32.200\n how do I keep my mind sharp\n\n41:32.200 --> 41:35.840\n while also keeping the physical performance sharp?\n\n41:35.840 --> 41:38.000\n And that's a little bit scary\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.640\n because talking to David like actual intellectually sharp,\n\n41:42.640 --> 41:47.640\n like thinking, being charismatic as much as I can be,\n\n41:47.640 --> 41:51.320\n and like being so maintaining a sense of humor too,\n\n41:51.320 --> 41:54.360\n because I can be, I become with sleep deprivation,\n\n41:54.360 --> 41:56.840\n with exhaustion, you start being.\n\n41:56.840 --> 41:58.080\n The Russian bear comes out.\n\n41:58.080 --> 41:59.960\n You start being such a,\n\n41:59.960 --> 42:03.200\n like I become a David Goggins essentially like.\n\n42:03.200 --> 42:04.440\n Oh, it makes you irritable.\n\n42:04.440 --> 42:06.520\n Sleep deprivation makes us irritable.\n\n42:06.520 --> 42:07.440\n Yeah.\n\n42:07.440 --> 42:09.760\n It's clear so that in the early part of the night,\n\n42:09.760 --> 42:12.640\n we get a higher percentage of those old Tradian cycles\n\n42:12.640 --> 42:15.320\n are occupied by slow wave sleep,\n\n42:15.320 --> 42:17.120\n sometimes just called non REM sleep.\n\n42:17.120 --> 42:21.280\n And those early night sleep bouts\n\n42:21.280 --> 42:23.640\n are great for muscular repair\n\n42:23.640 --> 42:25.480\n and for certain forms of learning,\n\n42:25.480 --> 42:27.960\n but REM sleep, the rapid eye movement sleep,\n\n42:27.960 --> 42:29.440\n which it starts to accumulate\n\n42:29.440 --> 42:32.400\n and occupy more of those 90 minute old Tradian cycles\n\n42:32.400 --> 42:34.960\n toward the late part of a sleep bout.\n\n42:34.960 --> 42:37.520\n So typically toward morning,\n\n42:37.520 --> 42:40.440\n but toward after you've been asleep a while,\n\n42:40.440 --> 42:42.760\n that's when you do the emotional processing.\n\n42:42.760 --> 42:47.000\n That's when we recover the ability to feel refreshed\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:48.480\n and not irritated by things.\n\n42:48.480 --> 42:50.720\n And if you deprive people of REM sleep,\n\n42:50.720 --> 42:55.720\n they become selectively bad at uncoupling the emotion\n\n42:56.520 --> 42:58.320\n from things that happened in the previous days.\n\n42:58.320 --> 43:00.680\n So the little things start to seem like big things.\n\n43:00.680 --> 43:05.040\n I always know I'm REM sleep deprived when I'm irritable.\n\n43:05.040 --> 43:07.640\n And when I look at like the word the,\n\n43:07.640 --> 43:09.040\n and it doesn't look like it's spelled right.\n\n43:09.040 --> 43:10.320\n And I'm kind of pissed off about it.\n\n43:10.320 --> 43:11.200\n Like something's off.\n\n43:11.200 --> 43:15.240\n And we actually are becoming slightly psychotic\n\n43:15.240 --> 43:16.920\n when we're REM sleep deprived.\n\n43:16.920 --> 43:18.760\n You're not going to get a lot of REM sleep in this thing,\n\n43:18.760 --> 43:20.240\n except as you fatigue more,\n\n43:20.240 --> 43:21.080\n if you do fall asleep,\n\n43:21.080 --> 43:22.480\n you're going to drop more and more into REM\n\n43:22.480 --> 43:24.120\n so that those 90 minute cycles,\n\n43:24.120 --> 43:26.040\n you won't have to go through stage one,\n\n43:26.040 --> 43:27.880\n stage two, stage three, and then REM,\n\n43:27.880 --> 43:30.160\n you're just going to drop right into REM.\n\n43:30.160 --> 43:33.680\n So you can count on your system to compensate for you.\n\n43:33.680 --> 43:35.960\n But I think that just the knowledge\n\n43:35.960 --> 43:38.440\n that you tend to get irritable as the time goes on,\n\n43:38.440 --> 43:40.280\n just that third personing of yourself,\n\n43:40.280 --> 43:42.120\n that awareness, the observer,\n\n43:42.120 --> 43:43.360\n that can be very beneficial\n\n43:43.360 --> 43:46.160\n because there may be bouts during this event\n\n43:46.160 --> 43:49.160\n when you just should probably say nothing.\n\n43:49.160 --> 43:51.440\n And maybe you just, I don't know,\n\n43:51.440 --> 43:55.560\n smile and record or not smile or do whatever it is\n\n43:55.560 --> 43:57.520\n because you're going to be conserving energy.\n\n43:57.520 --> 43:58.800\n If it feels like a grind,\n\n43:58.800 --> 44:00.640\n that's epinephrine being released.\n\n44:00.640 --> 44:02.840\n That's epinephrine that you could devote\n\n44:02.840 --> 44:04.560\n to the physical effort.\n\n44:04.560 --> 44:06.840\n But humor is an amazing anecdote for this\n\n44:06.840 --> 44:09.000\n because it resets that,\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:10.800\n it's that dopamine release\n\n44:10.800 --> 44:13.080\n that gives us that fresh perspective.\n\n44:13.080 --> 44:15.360\n And it's a real chemical thing.\n\n44:15.360 --> 44:17.200\n It's not a hack.\n\n44:17.200 --> 44:18.640\n It's not a trick.\n\n44:18.640 --> 44:20.320\n It's not a visualization.\n\n44:20.320 --> 44:22.640\n It's biology in action.\n\n44:22.640 --> 44:27.640\n Well, but I think the act of interviewing,\n\n44:28.080 --> 44:29.920\n of conversation in these processes,\n\n44:29.920 --> 44:32.200\n even if you don't want to do it,\n\n44:32.200 --> 44:35.520\n the right thing to do, even when you're feeling irritable,\n\n44:35.520 --> 44:39.200\n is to do the third person view\n\n44:39.200 --> 44:41.080\n and be able to express with words\n\n44:41.080 --> 44:42.880\n that you're feeling irritable.\n\n44:42.880 --> 44:45.920\n Like express what you're going through.\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:48.880\n Use words, which I hate doing.\n\n44:48.880 --> 44:50.720\n I honestly, I think my ultimate thing\n\n44:50.720 --> 44:53.600\n would be just to never say a single word to David Gagas\n\n44:53.600 --> 44:55.280\n and just go through hell.\n\n44:55.280 --> 44:57.080\n It doesn't matter what we do,\n\n44:57.080 --> 45:00.280\n but to do it quietly, to also express it.\n\n45:00.280 --> 45:01.800\n That's my ultimate hell.\n\n45:01.800 --> 45:02.640\n And I think that's...\n\n45:02.640 --> 45:03.480\n Well, he's definitely going to be,\n\n45:03.480 --> 45:04.680\n if I know David at all,\n\n45:04.680 --> 45:06.600\n he's going to try and find your buttons.\n\n45:06.600 --> 45:08.840\n Like he's going to, I mean,\n\n45:08.840 --> 45:10.960\n even though he knows he can complete this,\n\n45:10.960 --> 45:13.880\n and I believe that he trusts that you can complete it too,\n\n45:13.880 --> 45:15.920\n I believe you will complete it.\n\n45:15.920 --> 45:17.320\n You know you will complete it, right.\n\n45:17.320 --> 45:18.640\n There's no question about that.\n\n45:18.640 --> 45:20.280\n But he's not going to make it easier for you.\n\n45:20.280 --> 45:21.400\n He's going to make it harder.\n\n45:21.400 --> 45:22.240\n Well, I'm afraid.\n\n45:22.240 --> 45:25.000\n So I'm like, it's very difficult for me.\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:26.880\n So 48 miles is not easy.\n\n45:26.880 --> 45:28.320\n I have not been training that much.\n\n45:28.320 --> 45:30.200\n So I'm not ramping up,\n\n45:30.200 --> 45:34.120\n but it's not like going to kill me.\n\n45:34.120 --> 45:34.960\n We'll see what happens.\n\n45:34.960 --> 45:37.240\n Of course, for him, he might always get bored\n\n45:37.240 --> 45:40.720\n because I think the 48 miles for him is easy.\n\n45:40.720 --> 45:41.560\n I think...\n\n45:41.560 --> 45:45.640\n I don't know that that ever gets easy.\n\n45:45.640 --> 45:48.400\n I have a friend, Casey Cordial, who works with David.\n\n45:48.400 --> 45:53.400\n He does some physical rehab type stuff with him.\n\n45:53.480 --> 45:55.960\n And he took Casey on a 50 miler\n\n45:55.960 --> 45:57.960\n and Casey said it's like 16 miles and do it.\n\n45:57.960 --> 46:00.720\n He was just like, he had hit his wall,\n\n46:00.720 --> 46:02.480\n but he found it.\n\n46:02.480 --> 46:06.120\n They find it to get, you know, you find that portal.\n\n46:06.120 --> 46:07.480\n There is one thing I want to mention.\n\n46:07.480 --> 46:10.000\n There's some very good physiology\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:12.920\n that can perhaps support the actual running effort part.\n\n46:12.920 --> 46:14.640\n These are very new data.\n\n46:14.640 --> 46:17.880\n We have a study going on with David Spiegel at Stanford,\n\n46:17.880 --> 46:19.800\n looking at how different patterns of breathing\n\n46:19.800 --> 46:21.800\n can affect heart rate variability.\n\n46:21.800 --> 46:23.400\n Heart rate variability is good.\n\n46:23.400 --> 46:25.160\n There's this interesting mechanism\n\n46:25.160 --> 46:27.040\n that I think most people might not realize,\n\n46:27.040 --> 46:29.220\n but that medical students learn that your breathing\n\n46:29.220 --> 46:31.600\n and your heart rate and your brain\n\n46:31.600 --> 46:33.480\n are in this really remarkable interplay.\n\n46:33.480 --> 46:34.400\n It goes like this.\n\n46:34.400 --> 46:36.320\n When you inhale, this isn't breath work.\n\n46:36.320 --> 46:37.440\n We're not going to do breath work.\n\n46:37.440 --> 46:40.860\n But when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down.\n\n46:42.320 --> 46:43.360\n The heart gets a little bigger\n\n46:43.360 --> 46:45.640\n because there's a little more space in the thoracic cavity.\n\n46:45.640 --> 46:49.200\n And as a consequence, blood flows a little bit more slowly\n\n46:49.200 --> 46:50.760\n through that larger volume.\n\n46:50.760 --> 46:53.760\n And there's a category of neurons, the sinonitrile node,\n\n46:53.760 --> 46:58.440\n that sees that, that recognizes that slower rate\n\n46:58.440 --> 46:59.600\n through that larger volume.\n\n46:59.600 --> 47:01.000\n It sends a signal to the brainstem\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:02.760\n and the brainstem sends a signal back to the heart\n\n47:02.760 --> 47:04.360\n to speed the heart up.\n\n47:04.360 --> 47:06.240\n So every time you inhale, you're speeding the heart up.\n\n47:06.240 --> 47:08.400\n When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,\n\n47:08.400 --> 47:10.680\n the heart gets a little smaller, the volume is smaller,\n\n47:10.680 --> 47:12.640\n blood flows more quickly through the heart,\n\n47:12.640 --> 47:13.840\n signal sent up to the brain,\n\n47:13.840 --> 47:17.860\n and the brain sends a signal back to slow the heart down.\n\n47:17.860 --> 47:20.580\n This is the basis of heart rate variability.\n\n47:20.580 --> 47:23.260\n So at any point, if you feel like your heart is racing\n\n47:23.260 --> 47:25.280\n and you feel like you're working too hard\n\n47:25.280 --> 47:27.440\n per unit of effort,\n\n47:27.440 --> 47:30.400\n focus on making your exhales longer\n\n47:30.400 --> 47:32.600\n or more intense than your inhales.\n\n47:32.600 --> 47:34.760\n If ever you feel like you're truly flagging,\n\n47:34.760 --> 47:36.640\n you do not have the energy to get up,\n\n47:36.640 --> 47:39.440\n it's like, okay, it's time to go and you're exhausted,\n\n47:39.440 --> 47:42.420\n you want to draw more oxygen into the system,\n\n47:42.420 --> 47:44.360\n get your heart rate going faster.\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:46.160\n Now, some people when they hear this probably think,\n\n47:46.160 --> 47:47.260\n well, this is really obvious,\n\n47:47.260 --> 47:49.020\n but there's so much out there about breath work\n\n47:49.020 --> 47:50.280\n and how to breathe and all this stuff,\n\n47:50.280 --> 47:52.480\n but no one talks about how to do it in real time\n\n47:52.480 --> 47:53.880\n while you're exerting effort.\n\n47:53.880 --> 47:57.920\n So this is something like almost like second by second,\n\n47:57.920 --> 48:00.720\n you can adjust things just in real time\n\n48:00.720 --> 48:01.760\n based on how you're feeling,\n\n48:01.760 --> 48:03.200\n but based on the heart rate.\n\n48:03.200 --> 48:04.040\n That's right.\n\n48:04.040 --> 48:04.960\n The experience of the heart rate.\n\n48:04.960 --> 48:05.800\n That's right.\n\n48:05.800 --> 48:08.120\n So one thing that could be very efficient\n\n48:08.120 --> 48:10.160\n and we're doing some work with athletes now,\n\n48:10.160 --> 48:11.760\n so these are unpublished data,\n\n48:11.760 --> 48:14.340\n but if you, while you're running,\n\n48:14.340 --> 48:16.820\n if you want to get into a nice cadence\n\n48:16.820 --> 48:19.600\n of heart rate variability, do double inhales\n\n48:21.980 --> 48:23.040\n while you're running.\n\n48:23.040 --> 48:25.260\n What this will do is that when you do the double inhale\n\n48:25.260 --> 48:28.720\n has the effect of reopening the alveoli of the lungs,\n\n48:28.720 --> 48:31.320\n your lungs are filled with tons of little sacks,\n\n48:31.320 --> 48:34.600\n when they tend to collapse as you fatigue\n\n48:34.600 --> 48:36.480\n and carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream.\n\n48:36.480 --> 48:37.780\n And that's when we start getting stressed.\n\n48:37.780 --> 48:39.800\n If you've ever been sprinting and you start getting beat\n\n48:39.800 --> 48:41.500\n and you're going as hard as you can,\n\n48:41.500 --> 48:43.240\n what you really need to do is double inhale\n\n48:43.240 --> 48:45.080\n and reinflate these sacks in the lungs\n\n48:45.080 --> 48:47.160\n and then offload a lot of carbon dioxide.\n\n48:47.160 --> 48:49.740\n So when you're at a steady cadence and you're feeling good,\n\n48:49.740 --> 48:52.840\n double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale\n\n48:52.840 --> 48:54.920\n is a terrific way to breathe\n\n48:54.920 --> 48:56.920\n while you're in ongoing effort.\n\n48:56.920 --> 49:00.120\n By the way, any recommendations or differences\n\n49:00.120 --> 49:03.000\n in nose or mouth breathing?\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.880\n So nasal breathing, there's a lot of excitement now,\n\n49:05.880 --> 49:07.080\n obviously about nasal breathing\n\n49:07.080 --> 49:09.360\n because of James Nestor's book, Breath.\n\n49:09.360 --> 49:12.160\n There was also, if people are going to know about that book,\n\n49:12.160 --> 49:15.680\n I do feel like out of respect for my colleagues,\n\n49:15.680 --> 49:19.240\n there was a book by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich\n\n49:19.240 --> 49:20.900\n at Stanford, both professors at Stanford\n\n49:20.900 --> 49:24.440\n with a forward by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.\n\n49:24.440 --> 49:26.240\n So some heavy hitters in this book.\n\n49:26.240 --> 49:28.880\n And the book is called Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic.\n\n49:28.880 --> 49:32.640\n And it's all about how nasal breathing is better for us,\n\n49:32.640 --> 49:35.160\n especially kids, than being mouth breathers\n\n49:35.160 --> 49:38.320\n under most conditions for sake of improving immunity.\n\n49:38.320 --> 49:40.280\n It turns out there's a microbiome in the nose,\n\n49:40.280 --> 49:41.520\n like all sorts of good stuff\n\n49:41.520 --> 49:43.840\n about nasal breathing preferentially.\n\n49:43.840 --> 49:48.640\n But when we exercise, you can do pure nasal breathing.\n\n49:48.640 --> 49:50.960\n But the problem is once you get up to kind of third\n\n49:50.960 --> 49:52.760\n and fourth and fifth gear effort,\n\n49:52.760 --> 49:55.440\n you can't nasal breathe and be at maximum capacity\n\n49:55.440 --> 49:57.480\n unless you've been training it for a very long time.\n\n49:57.480 --> 49:59.440\n So I would say double inhale through the nose,\n\n49:59.440 --> 50:00.680\n offload through the mouth.\n\n50:00.680 --> 50:03.800\n So double inhale, exhale while you're in steady effort.\n\n50:03.800 --> 50:05.960\n And then if you really feel like you need to gas it\n\n50:05.960 --> 50:08.480\n and you're pushing, the data show that then\n\n50:08.480 --> 50:10.840\n just use whatever's there, right?\n\n50:10.840 --> 50:12.580\n Just go into kind of default mode\n\n50:12.580 --> 50:15.760\n because bringing too much concentration to something\n\n50:15.760 --> 50:17.920\n is also going to spend epinephrine.\n\n50:17.920 --> 50:20.420\n The goal is to get into that, I don't like the word,\n\n50:20.420 --> 50:22.960\n but the flow state where you're not thinking too much,\n\n50:22.960 --> 50:24.920\n you're just in exertion.\n\n50:24.920 --> 50:28.200\n So these are things that can help in the transitions,\n\n50:28.200 --> 50:31.600\n but I don't think there's any secret breathing technique.\n\n50:31.600 --> 50:33.800\n Anyone who's been in the SEAL teams will kind of,\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:37.120\n they'll tell you like, there's no breathing technique, right?\n\n50:37.120 --> 50:41.400\n There's tools that you can look to from time to time.\n\n50:41.400 --> 50:43.160\n And these double inhale exhales can be great\n\n50:43.160 --> 50:45.740\n for setting heart rate variability very quickly\n\n50:45.740 --> 50:48.280\n and getting into a steady cadence while you're exercising.\n\n50:48.280 --> 50:49.320\n But if there's a sprint,\n\n50:49.320 --> 50:50.980\n like if suddenly you guys are sprinting,\n\n50:50.980 --> 50:54.880\n ditch the double inhale, exhale, and just sprint.\n\n50:54.880 --> 50:56.220\n One thing that you mentioned,\n\n50:56.220 --> 50:58.540\n he's probably gonna push my buttons.\n\n50:58.540 --> 51:01.200\n It's a good place to ask a question about anger.\n\n51:01.200 --> 51:04.520\n So I'll probably get pissed off at him at some point.\n\n51:04.520 --> 51:05.820\n I'm guessing.\n\n51:05.820 --> 51:10.820\n And do you have thoughts from a scientific perspective\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.600\n or also just the personal philosophical perspective\n\n51:14.600 --> 51:16.560\n about the role of anger in all of this\n\n51:16.560 --> 51:20.720\n and in managing alertness, performance?\n\n51:20.720 --> 51:21.880\n I think about this a lot\n\n51:21.880 --> 51:23.800\n because there's so much out there\n\n51:23.800 --> 51:25.580\n about how important it is to do things\n\n51:25.580 --> 51:28.680\n from a place of love, you know.\n\n51:28.680 --> 51:30.000\n I tweet about it all the time.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.960\n And I think, and love is powerful, right?\n\n51:32.960 --> 51:35.860\n It is interesting that autonomic arousal alertness,\n\n51:35.860 --> 51:37.240\n let's just use simple language,\n\n51:37.240 --> 51:41.160\n alertness physiologically looks identical\n\n51:41.160 --> 51:45.720\n for love and excitement as it does for anger\n\n51:45.720 --> 51:48.800\n and frustration and wanting to defeat your opponent\n\n51:49.840 --> 51:52.380\n or whoever that opponent happens to be.\n\n51:52.380 --> 51:54.960\n They're identical except that the love component\n\n51:54.960 --> 51:57.600\n does tend to be associated with the release\n\n51:57.600 --> 52:01.020\n of neurochemicals of the serotonin and dopamine type\n\n52:01.020 --> 52:03.920\n that do have this replenishment component.\n\n52:03.920 --> 52:06.400\n I don't think one wants to be in constant anger\n\n52:06.400 --> 52:10.380\n and friction, but I mean, I'll come clean a bit.\n\n52:10.380 --> 52:11.600\n There've been portions of my career\n\n52:11.600 --> 52:14.160\n where some of my best work, my extra two hours,\n\n52:14.160 --> 52:17.720\n my ability to nail a really hard deadline or problem\n\n52:17.720 --> 52:21.320\n has come from not wanting to get out competed\n\n52:21.320 --> 52:24.720\n or from wanting to prove something.\n\n52:24.720 --> 52:29.280\n These days, I'm not oriented from that place\n\n52:29.280 --> 52:30.920\n toward my work quite as often,\n\n52:30.920 --> 52:33.000\n but I think we should be really honest.\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:36.320\n Anger is powerful provided it's channeled.\n\n52:36.320 --> 52:40.360\n It's very, very powerful and it can give you a ton of fuel\n\n52:40.360 --> 52:44.680\n and gas to push when otherwise you tap.\n\n52:44.680 --> 52:49.440\n Yeah, Joe Rogan has, aside from being a fan of his,\n\n52:49.440 --> 52:52.480\n has been an inspiration to sort of be,\n\n52:52.480 --> 52:55.720\n to have a kind of loving view on the world\n\n52:55.720 --> 52:58.200\n and the way you approach the world to me.\n\n52:58.200 --> 53:01.780\n So I've tended to want to approach the world that way,\n\n53:01.780 --> 53:06.160\n but in the same way, David Goggins has been an inspiration\n\n53:06.160 --> 53:11.160\n to like, yeah, be angry at stuff and use it as fuel.\n\n53:13.280 --> 53:17.680\n Like he almost conjures up artificial demons in his mind\n\n53:17.680 --> 53:19.620\n just so he can fight them.\n\n53:19.620 --> 53:22.480\n You know, but at the same time I tried that\n\n53:22.480 --> 53:25.000\n because I did a challenge in the summer\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.900\n of where for 30 days I was doing a lot of pushups\n\n53:27.900 --> 53:32.900\n and it was, over time, it was counterproductive for me.\n\n53:33.960 --> 53:37.360\n Like I found that it was easier to just,\n\n53:38.800 --> 53:42.120\n like the rollercoaster that the emotional,\n\n53:42.120 --> 53:46.240\n like being angry at stuff takes you can also be exhausting.\n\n53:46.240 --> 53:48.720\n Oh, absolutely, and it can take you down,\n\n53:48.720 --> 53:53.120\n like the ups of it are good, but the downs are bad.\n\n53:53.120 --> 53:56.040\n And what I found is better to get,\n\n53:56.040 --> 53:57.800\n to use it as a boost every once in a while,\n\n53:57.800 --> 54:00.620\n but mostly to get lost in the,\n\n54:00.620 --> 54:01.880\n you're talking about the breath work,\n\n54:01.880 --> 54:05.360\n the like getting lost in the ritual of it,\n\n54:05.360 --> 54:07.200\n like the beat like that,\n\n54:07.200 --> 54:10.880\n as opposed to going on the big rollercoasters of emotion.\n\n54:10.880 --> 54:14.720\n Yet this brings us into the realm of neuroendocrinology.\n\n54:14.720 --> 54:16.360\n There's a fascinating relationship between\n\n54:16.360 --> 54:18.260\n the hormone system and the nervous system.\n\n54:18.260 --> 54:22.080\n And, you know, hormones work in general on slower timescales.\n\n54:22.080 --> 54:24.240\n The definition of a hormone is a chemical released\n\n54:24.240 --> 54:25.480\n at one location in the body,\n\n54:25.480 --> 54:28.260\n goes and acts at multiple locations far away\n\n54:28.260 --> 54:29.100\n within the body.\n\n54:29.100 --> 54:30.860\n Pheromone would be between two bodies.\n\n54:31.880 --> 54:33.880\n Neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin\n\n54:33.880 --> 54:35.000\n tend to work a little more quickly.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.360\n There are hormones like adrenaline and cortisol\n\n54:37.360 --> 54:38.440\n that can work very fast,\n\n54:38.440 --> 54:43.440\n but here I'm referring mainly to testosterone, prolactin.\n\n54:43.440 --> 54:45.200\n Prolactin tends to be in men,\n\n54:45.200 --> 54:47.340\n and women tends to make people kind of lazy\n\n54:47.340 --> 54:49.740\n and want to take care of young.\n\n54:49.740 --> 54:52.640\n It tends to throw down body fat so we can stay up late.\n\n54:52.640 --> 54:54.940\n It's secreted in response to having children.\n\n54:54.940 --> 54:58.240\n These are all in humans and in animals.\n\n54:58.240 --> 54:59.840\n There's a very interesting relationship\n\n54:59.840 --> 55:02.780\n between testosterone and dopamine\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:07.600\n that speaks directly to what we're talking about now.\n\n55:07.600 --> 55:11.840\n So dopamine and testosterone are closely related\n\n55:11.840 --> 55:14.320\n in the pituitary system.\n\n55:14.320 --> 55:16.800\n And obviously testosterone comes from the adrenals\n\n55:16.800 --> 55:18.440\n and from the testes.\n\n55:18.440 --> 55:21.920\n But the major effect of testosterone\n\n55:21.920 --> 55:24.840\n is to make effort feel good.\n\n55:24.840 --> 55:26.240\n That's what testosterone does.\n\n55:26.240 --> 55:27.800\n It has other effects too, right?\n\n55:27.800 --> 55:28.720\n Reproductive effects,\n\n55:28.720 --> 55:31.520\n androgenizing parts of the body, et cetera.\n\n55:31.520 --> 55:34.560\n But it makes effort feel good.\n\n55:34.560 --> 55:38.200\n The testosterone molecule is synthesized from cholesterol.\n\n55:38.200 --> 55:41.200\n Cholesterol can either be made into cortisol,\n\n55:41.200 --> 55:43.880\n a stress hormone, or testosterone, but not both.\n\n55:43.880 --> 55:46.600\n So you have a limited amount of cholesterol\n\n55:46.600 --> 55:49.000\n and it gets diverted towards stress\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:52.040\n or this pathway where effort feels good.\n\n55:53.460 --> 55:55.280\n That's the pathway you want to get into.\n\n55:55.280 --> 55:56.340\n The anger pathway,\n\n55:56.340 --> 56:00.240\n if we were to just kind of play a mind experiment here,\n\n56:00.240 --> 56:02.640\n the anger eventually is going to divert\n\n56:02.640 --> 56:06.320\n more of that cholesterol molecule to cortisol and stress,\n\n56:06.320 --> 56:08.720\n and you will be slowly depleting testosterone.\n\n56:08.720 --> 56:10.600\n Now going into this,\n\n56:10.600 --> 56:11.840\n you'll have plenty of testosterone,\n\n56:11.840 --> 56:13.320\n but after a couple of days,\n\n56:13.320 --> 56:15.240\n there've been very interesting studies showing\n\n56:15.240 --> 56:17.680\n that testosterone doesn't necessarily drop\n\n56:17.680 --> 56:19.160\n with sleep deprivation.\n\n56:19.160 --> 56:20.320\n That's a bit of a myth.\n\n56:20.320 --> 56:22.000\n You need it to replenish testosterone.\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.480\n You need sleep to replenish testosterone eventually.\n\n56:24.480 --> 56:25.840\n But the real question is,\n\n56:25.840 --> 56:27.920\n are you enjoying what you're doing?\n\n56:27.920 --> 56:29.960\n And here the work was,\n\n56:29.960 --> 56:33.320\n some of the major work on this was done by Duncan French,\n\n56:33.320 --> 56:34.880\n who runs the UFC Training Center.\n\n56:34.880 --> 56:37.660\n He did his PhD at UConn stores,\n\n56:37.660 --> 56:40.040\n did a really beautiful PhD thesis\n\n56:40.040 --> 56:42.080\n looking at the relationship between stress hormones,\n\n56:42.080 --> 56:44.560\n testosterone, and dopamine.\n\n56:44.560 --> 56:45.920\n Really interesting work.\n\n56:45.920 --> 56:49.240\n And the takeaway from all of this is,\n\n56:49.240 --> 56:51.280\n if you can just convince yourself,\n\n56:51.280 --> 56:54.400\n or ideally if you can just enjoy yourself,\n\n56:54.400 --> 56:55.820\n you are going to maintain\n\n56:55.820 --> 56:58.400\n or maybe even increase testosterone stores,\n\n56:58.400 --> 57:00.560\n which will make effort feel good.\n\n57:00.560 --> 57:03.360\n And to me, aside from neuroplasticity\n\n57:03.360 --> 57:06.480\n where everything becomes automatic after this experience,\n\n57:06.480 --> 57:08.880\n to me, that's the holy grail.\n\n57:08.880 --> 57:12.720\n When effort feels good, life just gets way better.\n\n57:12.720 --> 57:14.840\n And we're not talking about achieving the reward.\n\n57:14.840 --> 57:16.480\n I'm not talking about the end of this thing.\n\n57:16.480 --> 57:19.600\n I'm talking about the process of it feeling really good.\n\n57:19.600 --> 57:21.680\n Yeah, there is a magic to,\n\n57:23.320 --> 57:24.720\n I don't know if you can comment on this,\n\n57:24.720 --> 57:28.080\n but I find myself being able to,\n\n57:28.080 --> 57:30.120\n if I just say I'm feeling good,\n\n57:30.120 --> 57:34.900\n like this old hack of like smiling while you're running,\n\n57:34.900 --> 57:38.560\n if I just tell myself, I'm feeling really good right now,\n\n57:38.560 --> 57:40.760\n no matter how I'm actually feeling,\n\n57:40.760 --> 57:42.080\n I'll start feeling way better.\n\n57:42.080 --> 57:45.160\n And the whole thing, there's a cascading effect\n\n57:45.160 --> 57:48.840\n that allows me to maximize the effort.\n\n57:48.840 --> 57:50.420\n It's quite fascinating.\n\n57:50.420 --> 57:51.540\n It's weird.\n\n57:51.540 --> 57:52.860\n Hormones are powerful.\n\n57:52.860 --> 57:54.840\n The relationship between thoughts and hormones\n\n57:54.840 --> 57:57.080\n and these physiological things is enormous.\n\n57:57.080 --> 57:58.880\n I had a colleague that a few years ago,\n\n57:58.880 --> 58:01.520\n he was dying of pancreatic cancer.\n\n58:01.520 --> 58:03.040\n And I was interviewing him\n\n58:03.040 --> 58:05.680\n just because he's an important figure in our community.\n\n58:05.680 --> 58:07.040\n And I was a friend.\n\n58:07.040 --> 58:09.400\n And there was one day where he told me,\n\n58:09.400 --> 58:12.800\n he said, I don't want to make it past the new year.\n\n58:12.800 --> 58:15.080\n And it was crushing for me to hear.\n\n58:15.080 --> 58:18.440\n And I knew that he had been on some androgen therapy\n\n58:18.440 --> 58:20.160\n for a whole set of other things.\n\n58:20.160 --> 58:24.700\n And I said, have you taken your androgen cream?\n\n58:24.700 --> 58:25.860\n And he was like, no, I haven't done it.\n\n58:25.860 --> 58:27.300\n Go get it for me.\n\n58:27.300 --> 58:28.240\n I have this on film.\n\n58:28.240 --> 58:30.120\n He takes it, he puts the androgen cream on.\n\n58:30.120 --> 58:33.160\n I'm not suggesting people take androgens, by the way.\n\n58:33.160 --> 58:35.760\n 10 minutes later, he says, you know what?\n\n58:35.760 --> 58:37.560\n I think I want to live into the new year.\n\n58:37.560 --> 58:39.880\n And I'm going to write 12 letters of recommendation.\n\n58:39.880 --> 58:41.200\n He went to MIT, by the way.\n\n58:41.200 --> 58:43.880\n He said, I'm going to write 12 letters of recommendation.\n\n58:43.880 --> 58:44.720\n And he did.\n\n58:44.720 --> 58:47.160\n And so there's something about these molecules\n\n58:47.160 --> 58:50.480\n that in an ancient way, in all organisms,\n\n58:50.480 --> 58:52.720\n all mammals, as far as we know,\n\n58:52.720 --> 58:54.760\n are linked to the will to live.\n\n58:54.760 --> 58:57.520\n They're linked to effort and making effort feel good,\n\n58:57.520 --> 59:00.400\n which has been fundamental to the evolution of our species.\n\n59:00.400 --> 59:02.560\n I always say, people think that the opposite\n\n59:02.560 --> 59:05.000\n of testosterone is estrogen, but it's not.\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.400\n The opposite of testosterone is prolactin,\n\n59:07.400 --> 59:09.040\n which makes us feel quiescent\n\n59:09.040 --> 59:11.240\n and not in pursuit of things, et cetera.\n\n59:12.280 --> 59:14.660\n Testosterone makes effort feel good.\n\n59:14.660 --> 59:17.000\n Estrogen makes emotions feel okay.\n\n59:19.160 --> 59:24.000\n And they are in mixed amounts in people,\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.360\n as I say, have all chromosomal backgrounds.\n\n59:26.360 --> 59:27.200\n Yeah.\n\n59:27.200 --> 59:29.560\n I mean, you also mentioned fasting potentially\n\n59:29.560 --> 59:31.560\n through this two day thing.\n\n59:31.560 --> 59:35.080\n It'd be cool to get your thoughts about fasting in general.\n\n59:35.080 --> 59:38.320\n Do you think on a personal level\n\n59:38.320 --> 59:41.160\n and at a higher sort of level of studies\n\n59:41.160 --> 59:44.580\n that you're aware of and physiology and so on,\n\n59:44.580 --> 59:46.460\n what do you think about intermittent fasting\n\n59:46.460 --> 59:48.800\n of like not eating for 16 hours\n\n59:48.800 --> 59:51.620\n and then having an eight hour window\n\n59:51.620 --> 59:53.560\n or something I've been doing a lot recently,\n\n59:53.560 --> 59:56.480\n which is eating only once a day.\n\n59:56.480 --> 1:00:00.640\n So that's 24 hour fast, I guess, one meal a day\n\n1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:05.040\n or something I've been thinking about doing,\n\n1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:07.660\n haven't done yet of doing like 72 hours\n\n1:00:07.660 --> 1:00:11.440\n or some people do like five day fasts in general.\n\n1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:13.600\n So this will be for this particular run\n\n1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:17.640\n will be a 48 hour fast if I don't eat at all.\n\n1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:19.780\n What do you think about that for performance,\n\n1:00:19.780 --> 1:00:21.960\n for mood, for all those kinds of things?\n\n1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:23.720\n I can speak a little bit to the science\n\n1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:25.320\n and a little bit of my own experience\n\n1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:28.320\n and then some anecdotes of people that have done very hard,\n\n1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.280\n very long duration things and what they've told me.\n\n1:00:30.280 --> 1:00:32.220\n So I just want to make sure I'm separating those out\n\n1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:34.120\n so people know my sourcing.\n\n1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:37.280\n I think now none of this is about the actual\n\n1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:40.560\n longterm nutritional benefits of one thing or the other.\n\n1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:43.340\n But if you look at the science on intermittent fasting,\n\n1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:45.120\n it's pretty remarkable.\n\n1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:47.080\n Before I was at Stanford, my lab was in San Diego.\n\n1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:50.300\n One of my colleagues was such in Panda at the Salk\n\n1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:53.360\n is phenomenal biologist and researcher,\n\n1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:54.960\n wrote a book called the circadian code.\n\n1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:57.600\n It's very, very good and kind of popularized\n\n1:00:57.600 --> 1:00:59.440\n intermittent fasting, although there were others\n\n1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:01.840\n that had talked about this before.\n\n1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:04.240\n Ori Hofmechler talked about the warrior diet.\n\n1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:06.840\n People probably might not know who Ori is,\n\n1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:08.720\n but he's sort of the originator\n\n1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:11.040\n of this business of intermittent fasting\n\n1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:12.540\n eating once a day or limited.\n\n1:01:12.540 --> 1:01:15.240\n Anyway, Sachin has published papers,\n\n1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:17.520\n peer reviewed papers in very good journals\n\n1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:18.920\n like Cell and elsewhere,\n\n1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:22.200\n showing that limiting the consumption of calories\n\n1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:26.800\n to eight, four, six, or eight, or even 10 hours\n\n1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:28.720\n of every 24 hour cycle\n\n1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:32.920\n and keeping that more or less correlated with the light\n\n1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:37.640\n with when the sun is out leads to less liver disease,\n\n1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:41.720\n improved metabolic markers, less body fat, et cetera.\n\n1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:43.800\n In the mouse studies, they even gave the mice the choice\n\n1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:45.760\n to eat whatever they wanted, as much as they want,\n\n1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:48.160\n as long as they restrict it to a certain period\n\n1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:51.480\n within the 24 hour cycle, they did great.\n\n1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:53.740\n They maintained a healthy weight or even lost weight.\n\n1:01:53.740 --> 1:01:55.360\n When they took the same amount of food\n\n1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:58.320\n and they stretched it out across the entire 24 hour cycle.\n\n1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:00.320\n So this is eating every hour or two hours,\n\n1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:02.320\n the animals got fat and sick.\n\n1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:04.560\n So it's pretty remarkable data.\n\n1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:06.560\n How much of that translates to humans isn't clear,\n\n1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:10.240\n but one thing that's really clear with humans is adherence.\n\n1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:11.880\n We could talk a lot about nutrition\n\n1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:14.200\n and some of the problems with the studies on nutrition\n\n1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:16.160\n is that what people will do in a laboratory\n\n1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.600\n is often hard to do in the real world.\n\n1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.400\n Low carbohydrate diets just they tend,\n\n1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.400\n because they tend to focus on foods\n\n1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:27.000\n that have high amino acid content like meats.\n\n1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.800\n Generally people are less hungry on those\n\n1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:32.560\n than they are on calorie matched diets\n\n1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:34.720\n of fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates,\n\n1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:36.820\n because when the insulin goes up,\n\n1:02:36.820 --> 1:02:38.520\n you get hungry and you want to eat more.\n\n1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:40.720\n So this is not a push for carnivore\n\n1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:42.560\n or a push against one thing or the other.\n\n1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:45.140\n It's just, there are a lot of factors,\n\n1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:49.480\n but we know for sure that when you're fasted\n\n1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:52.260\n or when you have low amounts of carbohydrate in your system,\n\n1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:55.440\n complex carbohydrate, your alertness is going to go up.\n\n1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:00.000\n Fasting increases alertness and epinephrine\n\n1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.880\n for the sole purpose of getting you to go out\n\n1:03:01.880 --> 1:03:02.800\n and find food.\n\n1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:04.980\n Can you imagine if our ancestors got hungry\n\n1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:07.240\n and they were like, oh, I'm too tired to go find food.\n\n1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:08.240\n We wouldn't be here.\n\n1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:09.520\n It'd be like robots or something.\n\n1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:13.920\n One of your alien buddies will be like running the planet.\n\n1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:16.720\n So I think that if you want to be alert,\n\n1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:20.400\n fasting or keeping complex carbohydrates to a minimum\n\n1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:22.120\n is very valuable.\n\n1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:24.560\n If you want to sleep and you want to be sleepy,\n\n1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:27.400\n ingesting foods that have a lot of tryptophan,\n\n1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:28.920\n which is the precursor to serotonin,\n\n1:03:28.920 --> 1:03:31.320\n so complex carbohydrates like rice and grains,\n\n1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:32.660\n turkey, white meats,\n\n1:03:32.660 --> 1:03:34.700\n those things do create a sense of sleepiness.\n\n1:03:34.700 --> 1:03:36.200\n However, there is a caveat,\n\n1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:40.400\n and this is one problem with the once a day meal,\n\n1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:43.180\n is that anytime you have a lot of food in the gut,\n\n1:03:43.180 --> 1:03:44.640\n you're increasing sleepiness\n\n1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:46.680\n because you're diverting blood to the gut.\n\n1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:49.720\n It's going to trigger the vagus to signal to the brain\n\n1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:53.560\n to shut down your system and utilize those nutrients,\n\n1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:55.280\n digest and utilize those nutrients.\n\n1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:58.160\n So I've done the once a day eating thing.\n\n1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.400\n The problem is I eat so much in that meal\n\n1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:02.200\n that I'm exhausted.\n\n1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:05.740\n And so it doesn't always lend itself well to the schedule.\n\n1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:08.280\n But so in a six or eight hour eating block for me\n\n1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:10.080\n is a little bit better.\n\n1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:11.220\n I do eat carbohydrates.\n\n1:04:11.220 --> 1:04:13.160\n I'm probably one of the few people left on the West coast\n\n1:04:13.160 --> 1:04:14.720\n that actually consumes carbohydrates\n\n1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:15.560\n and we'll say that out loud.\n\n1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:17.840\n I don't know people eat carbs anymore, that's weird.\n\n1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:18.680\n They don't.\n\n1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:20.040\n Where do you even find carbs these days?\n\n1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:20.860\n I like oatmeal.\n\n1:04:20.860 --> 1:04:21.700\n I like rice.\n\n1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:24.400\n The other time is if people are doing very high intensity\n\n1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:26.480\n weight train, they need to replenish glycogen.\n\n1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:27.760\n On the alertness side,\n\n1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:30.200\n I do feel like it's probably person dependent.\n\n1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:34.920\n For me alertness, being alert makes my life better\n\n1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:38.840\n in a lot of ways, more than just the alertness itself.\n\n1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:41.520\n Like for example, one of the things I discovered\n\n1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:45.880\n with fasting is that when I was training twice a day\n\n1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:48.840\n in jujitsu, for example, and competing and so on,\n\n1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:52.320\n I performed way better at things that you traditionally\n\n1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:53.920\n would say you need carbs for,\n\n1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:56.000\n which is explosive movements and all that.\n\n1:04:56.860 --> 1:05:00.160\n I don't know if I actually perform better\n\n1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:05.160\n in terms of like the force of the explosion,\n\n1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:06.860\n the explosiveness.\n\n1:05:06.860 --> 1:05:09.680\n What I do know is the alertness resulted\n\n1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:13.500\n in me doing the technique more precisely.\n\n1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:16.360\n That's the dopamine and epinephrine system in action.\n\n1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:21.360\n And there are some other just purely physical aspects\n\n1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:25.920\n to one diet versus the other that can be complicated.\n\n1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:28.640\n If you're ingesting carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates,\n\n1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:31.080\n you're going to replenish glycogen, which is great,\n\n1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:33.480\n but they also tend to be bulky and fibrous.\n\n1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:35.320\n And I've never rolled jujitsu,\n\n1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:37.840\n but running when you have a lot of bulky fibrous food\n\n1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:41.160\n in your gut or in your intestine, it can be a barrier.\n\n1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:42.560\n It can be uncomfortable.\n\n1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:45.260\n And so some people do really well on low carbohydrate,\n\n1:05:45.260 --> 1:05:48.400\n meat rich diets, because they're just not as bloated.\n\n1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:51.480\n They're not carrying as much water and other stuff.\n\n1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:54.200\n Carbohydrate carries a lot of water molecules with it.\n\n1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:56.040\n So there are aspects to being able to train\n\n1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:58.200\n and being really explosive because you feel light.\n\n1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:00.160\n One anecdote that really, again,\n\n1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:02.560\n I'm not encouraging any one particular kind of diet,\n\n1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:07.140\n but I have a friend who was in the SEAL teams.\n\n1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:08.760\n I happen to know a number of people in that community.\n\n1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:11.420\n And he told me that he did this very long fast.\n\n1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:14.060\n It was a fast that I think you get to eat a little bit\n\n1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:15.480\n of soup or broth.\n\n1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:16.920\n And there's like a bar or something,\n\n1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:18.720\n but it's like a nine day thing.\n\n1:06:18.720 --> 1:06:21.280\n And he's a very strong athlete.\n\n1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:24.680\n And he said that on day six or seven,\n\n1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:27.300\n he was running up some hills or something\n\n1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:28.560\n while he was on deployment.\n\n1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:31.480\n And he felt amazing.\n\n1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.080\n He had kind of hit this other level.\n\n1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:35.280\n He was somebody who had boxed in the Naval Academy.\n\n1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:40.280\n He was somebody who knows and knew high output.\n\n1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:43.720\n And he felt like he discovered the 13th floor,\n\n1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:46.660\n that there was another floor to this performance space\n\n1:06:46.660 --> 1:06:50.560\n that he hadn't experienced except while he had fasted.\n\n1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:53.660\n And he said that that was a remarkable clarity of mind,\n\n1:06:53.660 --> 1:06:55.440\n energy, it's a little bit of what you described.\n\n1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:58.160\n He described a kind of suppleness and explosiveness.\n\n1:06:58.160 --> 1:06:59.400\n So there's probably something there.\n\n1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:01.000\n On which day?\n\n1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000\n At once he was in the fifth or sixth day of the fast.\n\n1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.360\n See, this is the thing is I've never been there\n\n1:07:06.360 --> 1:07:09.920\n on the second, third, fourth, fifth day, that kind of thing.\n\n1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:13.840\n But when I just don't eat for 20 hours,\n\n1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:18.840\n many times through my training, the clarity,\n\n1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:23.160\n it's like you feel like everyone is moving super slowly\n\n1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:25.520\n and you're able to like dominate people\n\n1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:26.920\n you weren't able to before.\n\n1:07:26.920 --> 1:07:27.760\n It's like.\n\n1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:29.600\n Well, you might've slipped into,\n\n1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:32.520\n or switched over rather into full ketosis.\n\n1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:36.400\n And ketogenic diets done properly can be great for people.\n\n1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:38.480\n The problem is if you do it wrong, you can really mess it up.\n\n1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:40.880\n I tried it once and I basically got psoriasis.\n\n1:07:40.880 --> 1:07:42.400\n I thought my scalp was going to fall off.\n\n1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.320\n I was like sloughing off all this.\n\n1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:47.160\n And then I stopped and I was taking the liquid ketones.\n\n1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:49.000\n And then all of a sudden I felt better again.\n\n1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.080\n But I was told that I just did it wrong.\n\n1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:53.200\n Yes.\n\n1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:54.040\n That's right.\n\n1:07:54.040 --> 1:07:55.320\n So I think there's a right way and a wrong way\n\n1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:56.760\n and you have to get it right.\n\n1:07:56.760 --> 1:07:57.600\n Definitely.\n\n1:07:57.600 --> 1:07:59.640\n And so I've experimented quite a bit with keto\n\n1:07:59.640 --> 1:08:02.480\n to see how my body feels and doing it the right way\n\n1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:03.800\n and following all the instructions.\n\n1:08:03.800 --> 1:08:07.560\n There's definitely a huge difference that,\n\n1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:09.360\n like for example, one of the things I discovered,\n\n1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:11.160\n everyone knows who said this,\n\n1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:15.360\n but I tried this recently over the past year\n\n1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:18.760\n is I started drinking when I don't feel great.\n\n1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:22.960\n If I'm fasting, a bone broth, a chicken bone broth.\n\n1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.640\n And for some reason, like magically it could be,\n\n1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:28.440\n this is the other thing, the mind, I don't know,\n\n1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:30.920\n but it makes me feel really good.\n\n1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:32.840\n Well, it could be the salt.\n\n1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:35.560\n So I mean, neurons, the action potential neurons,\n\n1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:37.360\n as you know, is sodium is rushing into the cell.\n\n1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:39.760\n You need enough extracellular sodium\n\n1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:42.280\n in order for your brain and nervous system to function.\n\n1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:45.760\n And so salt, I mean, unless people have hypertension,\n\n1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:46.600\n salt is great.\n\n1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:49.080\n There was an article in Science Magazine about a decade ago\n\n1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:50.880\n about how salt had been demonized\n\n1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:52.400\n and unless people have hypertension,\n\n1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:54.600\n provide you drink enough water, salt is great.\n\n1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:57.800\n You need sodium, magnesium, and potassium to function\n\n1:08:57.800 --> 1:08:59.280\n and for your nerve cells to work.\n\n1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:00.960\n I mean, people who overdrink water\n\n1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:03.880\n and don't consume enough electrolyte die.\n\n1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.640\n Now, hydration is really important.\n\n1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:07.280\n I know David's really into hydration.\n\n1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:08.480\n He's mentioned that a few times.\n\n1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:11.400\n I mean, hydrating properly is key.\n\n1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:12.920\n And so you definitely want to make sure\n\n1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:14.280\n that you're drinking enough water\n\n1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:16.320\n and getting enough electrolytes.\n\n1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:18.200\n We should have actually talked about that at the beginning\n\n1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:19.240\n because that's going to keep\n\n1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.440\n your nervous system functioning well.\n\n1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:24.880\n And a lot of people, they'll get shaky or jittery\n\n1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:27.920\n when they're fasting and they'll think they need sugar.\n\n1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:30.000\n And if they just put some salt in some water,\n\n1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:30.960\n they feel fine.\n\n1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:33.240\n And like the other stuff, potassium, magnesium,\n\n1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:34.720\n whatever the other electrolytes are.\n\n1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:36.520\n But yeah, those three.\n\n1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:38.040\n I mean, salt, yeah.\n\n1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:40.680\n Magnesium is good before sleep.\n\n1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:42.080\n Salt.\n\n1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.400\n I mean, this is a vast space.\n\n1:09:43.400 --> 1:09:44.720\n And we're kind of talking about the overlap\n\n1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:48.160\n between neurochemicals, hormones, and nutrition.\n\n1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:49.760\n And it's a fascinating space.\n\n1:09:49.760 --> 1:09:53.560\n And it's one that the academic community has gems\n\n1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:54.640\n within the textbooks.\n\n1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:57.680\n It hasn't really made it into the public sphere yet.\n\n1:09:57.680 --> 1:09:59.760\n And I think that's because people get so caught up\n\n1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:03.520\n in the being, are you vegan or are you carnivore?\n\n1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:05.920\n And there's a vast space in between too\n\n1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:06.800\n that people can explore.\n\n1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:08.240\n Like I'm not a competitive athlete.\n\n1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:12.840\n So I eat meat and I also eat vegetables and I eat fruits\n\n1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:14.360\n and it's just about timing them.\n\n1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:16.280\n But I tend to eat carbohydrates when I want to be sleepy.\n\n1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:17.120\n I eat them at night.\n\n1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:18.760\n And everyone said, that's the worst thing.\n\n1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:19.760\n You can't do that.\n\n1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:21.800\n You sleep great after eating a big bowl of pasta.\n\n1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:22.720\n I'll tell you.\n\n1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:25.680\n And by the way, I should give you a big thank you\n\n1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:28.360\n for connecting me with Bell Campo Farms.\n\n1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:31.960\n They sent me some meat, I think because of you.\n\n1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:34.400\n And it's delicious.\n\n1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:37.200\n So I really appreciate that.\n\n1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.160\n I mean, it also connected me with this whole world\n\n1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:43.840\n of people who are doing farming in this ethical way\n\n1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:46.080\n and like really love the whole process.\n\n1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:49.560\n And from both like a human level,\n\n1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.400\n but also scientific level.\n\n1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:56.240\n And the result is, it's like ethical,\n\n1:10:56.240 --> 1:10:57.760\n but also it's delicious.\n\n1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:00.360\n And it makes you think about your diet\n\n1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:01.840\n in a whole new kind of way.\n\n1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:04.520\n Yeah, I don't have any commercial relationship\n\n1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:06.000\n to Bell Campo, so I can be very clear.\n\n1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.440\n I've known Anya Fernald,\n\n1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:10.800\n who is the founder and CEO of Bell Campo.\n\n1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:12.600\n I've known her since the ninth grade.\n\n1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:15.200\n It is true that her parents are faculty members at Stanford,\n\n1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:16.320\n they're colleagues of mine,\n\n1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:18.760\n but she's just a serious academic of nutrition,\n\n1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:21.320\n but also of sustainable agriculture,\n\n1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:22.720\n of all sorts of things.\n\n1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.360\n And also the meat just, it's awesome.\n\n1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:25.200\n It tastes really good.\n\n1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:26.840\n And no, I'm not getting paid to say that.\n\n1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:29.040\n And no, they're not a sponsoring my podcast.\n\n1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:32.200\n It's just, I feel like if you're gonna eat animals,\n\n1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:35.120\n if that's in your framework and you're gonna eat animals,\n\n1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:39.360\n knowing that the animals were raised as happy as could be\n\n1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:43.640\n until time of slaughter is at least important to me.\n\n1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:45.240\n And actually talked to her,\n\n1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:47.640\n so I will talk to her on this podcast actually.\n\n1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:52.200\n And she invited me like a week ago out to visit the farm\n\n1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:53.400\n in May or June or whatever.\n\n1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:54.920\n Yeah, they have the farm up at the Oregon border.\n\n1:11:54.920 --> 1:11:56.720\n I haven't been there yet, but I've seen the pictures.\n\n1:11:56.720 --> 1:11:59.560\n It looks awesome and I was like, yes.\n\n1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:00.400\n It looks beautiful.\n\n1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:01.360\n Let me know when you're going.\n\n1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.240\n Yeah, let's go together.\n\n1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:06.280\n You'll probably run there, but I'll drive there.\n\n1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:09.720\n Yeah, but all that said, I do want to,\n\n1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:12.440\n cause a lot of people who are vegan write to me\n\n1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:14.640\n and I do want to seriously,\n\n1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:17.200\n in the same seriousness that I approached keto,\n\n1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:19.920\n I do wanna go like on a few months\n\n1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:23.320\n to switch to a vegan diet at some point to really try it.\n\n1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:24.320\n I haven't done it yet\n\n1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:26.880\n cause I'm afraid I'm gonna function better.\n\n1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:30.120\n I'm Argentine by my dad's side.\n\n1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.600\n And I don't eat meat super often,\n\n1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:36.840\n but well, for most people it would seem often,\n\n1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:40.640\n but I do love steak, I do.\n\n1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:41.920\n So I'm afraid I'm gonna feel better.\n\n1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:43.760\n There's a social element to steak, you're right.\n\n1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:45.400\n Cause coming from a Russian background,\n\n1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.240\n like I can't imagine going to visit my folks,\n\n1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:52.080\n like my parents for Thanksgiving or something to say,\n\n1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:55.600\n mom and dad, I don't eat meat.\n\n1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:56.720\n So instead of, you know.\n\n1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:58.000\n Well, I think if you're gonna eat meat,\n\n1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.960\n getting it from sources that are compatible\n\n1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:05.200\n with a continuation of the planet is good.\n\n1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:07.200\n I mean, there are some real problems\n\n1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:08.600\n with the factory farm meat.\n\n1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:09.920\n You know, you drive up and down the five\n\n1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:12.360\n and you pass that point where there are all those cows.\n\n1:13:12.360 --> 1:13:16.200\n I mean, as somebody who loves animals,\n\n1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:19.520\n it's clear that it's, you know,\n\n1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:22.200\n you wanna limit the amount of suffering of those animals.\n\n1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:24.040\n Whenever I hear about, you know,\n\n1:13:24.040 --> 1:13:27.000\n we know people that hunt and that go and get their own meat.\n\n1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.200\n I really admire that.\n\n1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:30.080\n I admire that people do that.\n\n1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:32.640\n We don't tend to do that in the hills around Stanford,\n\n1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:34.640\n you know, there are mountain lions back there,\n\n1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:35.480\n but that's about it.\n\n1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:40.280\n And I'm certainly, I admire the vegan mindset\n\n1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:41.880\n of just making that decision.\n\n1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:44.160\n You're just not gonna consume other beings,\n\n1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:45.960\n but you know, I haven't gone that way.\n\n1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:49.880\n But performance wise, I'm just curious because I was\n\n1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:53.400\n surprised, I was certain that eating five, six,\n\n1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:55.320\n seven meals a day is the right thing to do\n\n1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:58.840\n for if you wanna be perform your best\n\n1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:01.160\n when I was like 20 or whatever.\n\n1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:04.320\n And I would eat oatmeal, like I thought it's obvious\n\n1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:06.880\n I have to have a really, a lot of carbs in the breakfast.\n\n1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:08.920\n I had a lot of preconceived notions.\n\n1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:12.200\n And then when I started eating like once a day,\n\n1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:14.800\n this was at the peak of my competing in jiu jitsu,\n\n1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:19.800\n it was like, everything I know about nutrition is wrong.\n\n1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:22.680\n You realize that like, you have to become a scientist.\n\n1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:24.320\n First of all, you have to read literature,\n\n1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:26.000\n you have to learn, you have to experiment,\n\n1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.080\n but you also have to become a scientist of your own body.\n\n1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:32.040\n In the same way, I have a lot of preconceived notions\n\n1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:35.400\n of what performance is like under vegan diet.\n\n1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:38.000\n And I want to do it right.\n\n1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.160\n Like seriously, not necessarily for the ethical reasons,\n\n1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:45.880\n but to see if it's performance wise, like can I,\n\n1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:47.760\n I remember there's like a fruitarian diet\n\n1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:50.000\n where you eat fruit only.\n\n1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.520\n These extremes are like, they're pretty,\n\n1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:55.440\n they're interesting cause people have this need.\n\n1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:57.200\n The extremes are informative though, right?\n\n1:14:57.200 --> 1:14:58.840\n I mean, well controlled experiments,\n\n1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:00.760\n you eliminate as many variables as you can\n\n1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:02.040\n except the one you're interested in.\n\n1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:04.520\n So people are running these experiments.\n\n1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:09.480\n I think that it's hard to imagine getting,\n\n1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:12.520\n I know people say you can get enough amino acids\n\n1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:15.200\n from plant based sources and I believe that.\n\n1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:18.480\n I think it probably takes a little more work.\n\n1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:20.640\n One thing that's really clear is that the benefit\n\n1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:23.200\n of these omega three, omega six ratios,\n\n1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:24.840\n like fish oils and things like that.\n\n1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:27.160\n There are some data that show that the getting\n\n1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:30.080\n at least a thousand milligrams of the EPA,\n\n1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:32.240\n which is in high in fish oils, but other things too,\n\n1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:34.840\n even some meats and other plants,\n\n1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:39.840\n it in double, you know, in matched placebo,\n\n1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:41.840\n double blind controlled studies,\n\n1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:43.840\n placebo controlled double blind studies have shown\n\n1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:47.080\n that those can offset antidepressive symptoms\n\n1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:49.720\n as much as some of the selective serotonin reuptake\n\n1:15:49.720 --> 1:15:52.440\n inhibitors like Prozac and Zoloft.\n\n1:15:52.440 --> 1:15:54.280\n So that's pretty impressive.\n\n1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:57.640\n And in Scandinavia, people know, especially in winter,\n\n1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:00.320\n to consume a lot of those omega threes\n\n1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:03.000\n because they're good for you, they're good for the brain.\n\n1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.880\n That's the other question.\n\n1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:08.320\n Nutrition wise, what kind of stuff have you come across\n\n1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:09.160\n that's useful?\n\n1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:12.440\n Like I basically only take fish oil,\n\n1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:14.120\n like you said, electrolytes.\n\n1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:18.200\n Electrolytes with water, the David Goggins diet.\n\n1:16:18.200 --> 1:16:19.040\n Fish oil.\n\n1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:19.960\n Plus fish oil.\n\n1:16:19.960 --> 1:16:24.240\n And then again, the sponsor, they made it so easier.\n\n1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:26.640\n The sponsor of your podcast and mine,\n\n1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:28.840\n athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.\n\n1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:29.680\n Great stuff.\n\n1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:30.500\n Support it.\n\n1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:34.560\n I don't know, like it's great stuff for sure,\n\n1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:36.700\n but it also just takes away the headache of like,\n\n1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:37.840\n I don't have to think about.\n\n1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:40.280\n Yeah, you're going to get a bunch of vitamins and minerals.\n\n1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:41.360\n It does that.\n\n1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:44.840\n It sounds like a plug, but I have genuinely been buying it.\n\n1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:47.000\n I'm like, you know, no discount, no affiliation\n\n1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:48.560\n or anything since 2012.\n\n1:16:48.560 --> 1:16:50.360\n I think I heard about it on the Tim Ferriss podcast.\n\n1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:52.000\n I was like, oh, I'm going to try that stuff.\n\n1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:52.840\n And I liked it.\n\n1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:54.220\n I mean, when I was starting my lab,\n\n1:16:54.220 --> 1:16:56.200\n I was working insane hours.\n\n1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:57.960\n I still work very long hours.\n\n1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:01.960\n And getting sick limits productivity.\n\n1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:03.240\n And I also wanted to train\n\n1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:05.800\n and I wasn't doing much training back then.\n\n1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:09.720\n Now I try and get, you know, three, four sessions in a week.\n\n1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:11.900\n I'm not doing nothing like what you and David are doing\n\n1:17:11.900 --> 1:17:13.640\n or what, you know, Joe does,\n\n1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:15.640\n or like you guys are way more regimented\n\n1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:16.920\n and consistent than I am.\n\n1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:21.280\n But I think that being healthy and feeling good\n\n1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:24.160\n is one of the great benefits to a career\n\n1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:28.120\n is having energy and just being not sick.\n\n1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:32.000\n Can we take a step back to sleep for a little bit?\n\n1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:37.000\n And so people should definitely look through your podcast.\n\n1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:41.680\n The first five episodes were on sleep or no,\n\n1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:43.960\n I guess the first opening episode wasn't.\n\n1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:46.180\n First one was sort of how the brain works generally\n\n1:17:46.180 --> 1:17:47.960\n is to give people some background.\n\n1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:50.280\n And then we did four episodes on sleep,\n\n1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:52.640\n including some stuff about food, temperature, exercise,\n\n1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:56.120\n jet lag shift work for the jet lag folks and shift work.\n\n1:17:56.120 --> 1:17:57.640\n Yeah, take a masterclass on sleep.\n\n1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:01.900\n And then you're going on to a next topic\n\n1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:04.280\n in the next few episodes, which is incredible.\n\n1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:06.880\n We'll, neuroplasticity, we'll talk about it.\n\n1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:11.880\n But on sleep, one of the cool things about the human mind\n\n1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:13.740\n when it sleeps is dreaming.\n\n1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:17.360\n What do you think we understand\n\n1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:21.040\n about the contents of dreams?\n\n1:18:21.040 --> 1:18:22.720\n Like what do dreams mean?\n\n1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:25.380\n All the stuff we see when we dream,\n\n1:18:25.380 --> 1:18:28.680\n is there something that we understand\n\n1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:32.040\n about the contents of dreams?\n\n1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:33.480\n Some of it is very concrete.\n\n1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:38.480\n So Matt Wilson, who, MIT guy, showed in rodents\n\n1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:40.600\n and it's been shown in nonhuman primates\n\n1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:41.820\n and now it's been shown in humans\n\n1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:46.820\n that there is replay of spatial information during sleep.\n\n1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.440\n So initially what Matt showed was that\n\n1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:52.960\n as these little rodents navigate through a maze,\n\n1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:55.320\n there are these cells in the hippocampus called place cells\n\n1:18:55.320 --> 1:18:58.760\n that fire when the animal encounters a turn or a corridor.\n\n1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:02.720\n And that exact same sequence is replayed during sleep.\n\n1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:07.480\n And it turns out this is true in London taxi cab drivers.\n\n1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:11.060\n Before phones and GPS were what they are today,\n\n1:19:11.060 --> 1:19:13.400\n the London taxi cab drivers were famous\n\n1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:15.880\n for knowing the routes through the city,\n\n1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:17.600\n through these mental maps.\n\n1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:21.640\n And their analysis of their place cell firing during sleep\n\n1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:22.700\n and during wakefulness.\n\n1:19:22.700 --> 1:19:25.620\n And so we are essentially taking spatial information\n\n1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:28.160\n about the location of things and replaying it during sleep.\n\n1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:32.280\n However, it's not replayed so that you remember it all.\n\n1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:36.280\n It's replayed so that if there's a reason to remember it,\n\n1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:38.080\n the links to the emotional system,\n\n1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:41.960\n to the components of the limbic system and hypothalamus\n\n1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:43.200\n that are relevant,\n\n1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:45.460\n like you got into a car crash at a particular location,\n\n1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:46.600\n or you lost a bunch of money\n\n1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:48.800\n because you were a cab driver, Uber driver,\n\n1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:49.800\n we'd say nowadays,\n\n1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:52.260\n and you were stuck at one particular avenue all day\n\n1:19:52.260 --> 1:19:53.420\n and frustrated,\n\n1:19:53.420 --> 1:19:55.320\n and you were getting yelled at by your spouse,\n\n1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:57.440\n that information gets encoded\n\n1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:00.440\n so that you never forget that at that particular time of day\n\n1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:02.200\n and that particular time of year,\n\n1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:04.220\n and this thing happened.\n\n1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:06.700\n So context starts getting linked to experience.\n\n1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:08.340\n So there's spatial information\n\n1:20:08.340 --> 1:20:10.720\n that's absolutely replayed during sleep.\n\n1:20:10.720 --> 1:20:13.460\n And we experience this sometimes as dreams.\n\n1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:15.200\n The dreams that happen early in the night\n\n1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:18.520\n when slow wave sleep or non REM sleep dominates,\n\n1:20:18.520 --> 1:20:22.460\n tends to be sleep of very kind of general themes\n\n1:20:22.460 --> 1:20:24.640\n and kind of location.\n\n1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:27.880\n It can feel a little bit eerie and kind of strange.\n\n1:20:27.880 --> 1:20:29.080\n Not so incidentally,\n\n1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:30.100\n the early phase of the night\n\n1:20:30.100 --> 1:20:32.320\n is when growth hormone is released.\n\n1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:33.480\n In the 80s and 90s,\n\n1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:35.080\n there was a drug that was very popular.\n\n1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:37.340\n It's very legal now called GHB.\n\n1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:41.640\n You could actually buy it at GNC or a store then.\n\n1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:43.860\n I never took it, but it was a popular party drug\n\n1:20:43.860 --> 1:20:47.960\n and some famous celebrities died while on GHB.\n\n1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:49.400\n They were also on a bunch of other things,\n\n1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:50.480\n so it's not clear what killed them.\n\n1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:54.080\n But GHB was very big in certain communities\n\n1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:57.740\n because it promoted a massive release of growth hormone\n\n1:20:57.740 --> 1:20:59.920\n and gave people these very hypnotic states.\n\n1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:01.040\n So people go to clubs\n\n1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:02.860\n and they were in these very hypnotic states.\n\n1:21:02.860 --> 1:21:05.220\n It was part of a whole culture.\n\n1:21:05.220 --> 1:21:07.140\n That's early night.\n\n1:21:07.140 --> 1:21:09.920\n And those dreams tend to not have\n\n1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:12.720\n a lot of emotional content or load.\n\n1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:15.040\n That phase of dreaming is associated\n\n1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:18.320\n with the occasional jolting yourself out of sleep\n\n1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:20.120\n because it's somewhat lighter sleep.\n\n1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:22.420\n The dreams that occur during REM,\n\n1:21:22.420 --> 1:21:23.640\n during rapid eye movement sleep\n\n1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:26.520\n and that dominate towards morning are very different.\n\n1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:30.000\n They tend to have very little epinephrine\n\n1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.040\n is available in the brain at that time.\n\n1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:33.400\n Epinephrine again being this molecule\n\n1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:35.240\n of stress, fear, and excitement.\n\n1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:38.120\n You are paralyzed during these REM dreams.\n\n1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:39.780\n You cannot move.\n\n1:21:39.780 --> 1:21:41.720\n There's intense emotion\n\n1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:44.500\n at the level of what you're feeling\n\n1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:47.020\n and there's so called theory of mind.\n\n1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:48.880\n Theory of mind is an idea that was put forward\n\n1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:52.480\n by Simon Baron Cohen, Sasha Baron Cohen's cousin.\n\n1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:53.320\n I think on the podcast,\n\n1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:55.800\n I mistakenly said that he was at Oxford.\n\n1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:56.880\n It's like the cardinal sin.\n\n1:21:56.880 --> 1:21:58.300\n He's at Cambridge, forgive me.\n\n1:21:58.300 --> 1:21:59.580\n I'm not British.\n\n1:21:59.580 --> 1:22:02.880\n So the dreams in REM are heavily emotionally laden.\n\n1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:05.840\n And it's very clear that those dreams and REM sleep,\n\n1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:08.580\n if you deprive yourself of them for too long,\n\n1:22:08.580 --> 1:22:12.080\n you become irritable and you start linking\n\n1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:15.660\n generally negative emotions to almost everything.\n\n1:22:15.660 --> 1:22:17.800\n REM, the dreams that occur in REM sleep\n\n1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:21.800\n are when we divorce emotion from our prior experiences.\n\n1:22:21.800 --> 1:22:25.020\n And it's when we extract general rules and themes.\n\n1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:27.500\n MIT seems to have come up a lot today,\n\n1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:29.360\n but it's highly relevant.\n\n1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:32.840\n Susumu Tonagawa, Nobel prize for immunoglobulin,\n\n1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:36.080\n but obviously fantastic neuroscientist as well,\n\n1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:38.880\n has shown that the replay of neurons in the hippocampus\n\n1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:42.200\n and elsewhere in the brain is kind of an approximation\n\n1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:46.720\n of the previous episode and a lot of fear unlearning\n\n1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:50.800\n of uncoupling emotion from hard or traumatic events\n\n1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:53.280\n that happened previously occurs in REM sleep.\n\n1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:55.080\n So you don't want to deprive yourself of REM sleep\n\n1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:55.960\n for too long.\n\n1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:57.680\n And those dreams tend to be very intense.\n\n1:22:57.680 --> 1:22:59.400\n Now, epinephrine is low\n\n1:22:59.400 --> 1:23:02.280\n so that you can't suddenly act out your dreams.\n\n1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:04.880\n But what's interesting is sometimes people\n\n1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:07.920\n will wake up suddenly while in a REM dream\n\n1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:10.440\n and their heart will be beating really, really fast.\n\n1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:12.560\n That's a surge of epinephrine that occurs\n\n1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:14.860\n as you exit REM sleep.\n\n1:23:14.860 --> 1:23:16.920\n So you were having this intense emotional experience\n\n1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:18.120\n without the fear.\n\n1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:20.600\n You were essentially going through therapy in your sleep,\n\n1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:22.040\n self induced therapy.\n\n1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:23.120\n It's like trauma therapy,\n\n1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:26.040\n where you try and divorce the emotion from the experience.\n\n1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:27.600\n And then you wake up.\n\n1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:30.320\n And some people also have the other component of REM,\n\n1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:33.060\n which is atonia, which is paralysis.\n\n1:23:33.060 --> 1:23:36.840\n Pot smokers experience this a lot more than non pot smokers.\n\n1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:40.200\n There's an invasion of paralysis into the waking state.\n\n1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:42.600\n I'm not a pot smoker, but I have experienced this.\n\n1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:44.960\n And when you wake up and you're paralyzed for a second,\n\n1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:46.520\n it's terrifying.\n\n1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:48.760\n But then you jolt yourself alert.\n\n1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:51.460\n So the REM sleep is important\n\n1:23:51.460 --> 1:23:54.680\n for kind of the self induced therapy\n\n1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:56.820\n and forgetting the bad stuff.\n\n1:23:56.820 --> 1:23:59.960\n It's good for uncoupling the emotions from bad experiences.\n\n1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:02.200\n And just there are two therapies.\n\n1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:04.560\n Eye movement desensitization reprocessing,\n\n1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:08.120\n which is a eye movement thing that shuts down the amygdala\n\n1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:09.880\n during therapy, not during sleep.\n\n1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:13.120\n And ketamine, which is a dissociative analgesic.\n\n1:24:13.120 --> 1:24:15.320\n It's actually very similar to PCP.\n\n1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:18.560\n And ketamine is now being used as a trauma therapy\n\n1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:21.320\n when someone comes into the ER, for instance,\n\n1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:22.760\n and they were in a terrible car accident.\n\n1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:24.760\n I mean, these are horrible things to describe it.\n\n1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:26.040\n They saw a relative impaled\n\n1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:28.080\n on the steering column or something.\n\n1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:29.560\n And they will give this drug\n\n1:24:29.560 --> 1:24:31.760\n to try and shut off the emotion system\n\n1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.740\n so that, because they're not gonna forget,\n\n1:24:33.740 --> 1:24:36.200\n let's be honest, you don't forget the bad stuff,\n\n1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:39.640\n but it is possible to uncouple the bad events\n\n1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:41.560\n from the emotional system.\n\n1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:42.960\n And there's all sorts of ethical issues\n\n1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:44.580\n about whether or not that's good or bad to do.\n\n1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:48.120\n But PTSD is a failure to uncouple the emotion\n\n1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:50.200\n from these intense experiences.\n\n1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:52.440\n So the goal of this kind of therapy\n\n1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:55.600\n is in the uncoupling for that to be permanent.\n\n1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:56.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:57.600\n To separate.\n\n1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:59.280\n So they can recount the event\n\n1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:00.360\n and they can describe it\n\n1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:03.120\n without it triggering the same somatic experience\n\n1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:05.160\n of terror and dread,\n\n1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:07.980\n because terror, those feelings can be debilitating,\n\n1:25:07.980 --> 1:25:08.820\n obviously.\n\n1:25:08.820 --> 1:25:10.280\n And you're saying physiologically,\n\n1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:13.160\n in REM sleep, a similar process is happening.\n\n1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:14.360\n That's right.\n\n1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:17.360\n Thematically, REM sleep is about experiencing\n\n1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:19.880\n or replaying intense emotions\n\n1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:22.160\n without experiencing the somatic,\n\n1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:23.600\n the physical component of the emotion,\n\n1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:24.800\n either the acting out\n\n1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:28.200\n or the accelerated heart rate and agitation.\n\n1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:31.600\n Likewise with things like ketamine therapies.\n\n1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:32.440\n That's the idea,\n\n1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:34.360\n is you're uncoupling the physical sensation\n\n1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:36.040\n from the mental events.\n\n1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:39.340\n What is REM sleep and why is it so special?\n\n1:25:39.340 --> 1:25:40.600\n Maybe we can comment on that.\n\n1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:42.240\n Rapid eye movement sleep.\n\n1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:44.880\n Yeah, discovered in the 50s at the University of Chicago.\n\n1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:46.960\n It's intense brain activity,\n\n1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:49.040\n high levels of metabolic activity,\n\n1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:52.100\n dreams in which people report a lot of the theory of mind.\n\n1:25:52.100 --> 1:25:53.880\n We were talking about Simon Baron Cohen.\n\n1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:55.880\n Theory of mind was actually something\n\n1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:58.920\n that he developed for the diagnosis of autism.\n\n1:25:58.920 --> 1:26:03.280\n If you take kids, most kids of age five, six, seven,\n\n1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:05.560\n put them in front of a TV screen in the laboratory\n\n1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:06.560\n and you have them watch a video\n\n1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:08.920\n where a kid is playing with a ball or a doll.\n\n1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:10.840\n And then the kid puts it into a drawer,\n\n1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:12.160\n shuts the drawer and walks away.\n\n1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:14.120\n And another kid comes in and you ask the child\n\n1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:15.680\n who's observing this little movie,\n\n1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:18.520\n you say, what does this second child think?\n\n1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.720\n And a typical kid would say,\n\n1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:22.920\n they want to play and they don't know\n\n1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:24.040\n where the ball or doll is,\n\n1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:27.840\n or they're upset or they're sad, they want the doll.\n\n1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:31.580\n Autistic children tend to say the doll's in the drawer.\n\n1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:34.040\n The toy is in the drawer.\n\n1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:35.560\n They tend to fixate.\n\n1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:37.320\n They can't get on the event.\n\n1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:39.120\n They can't get into the mind of that.\n\n1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:40.920\n They don't have a theory of mind.\n\n1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:44.120\n Dreams in REM have a heavy theory of mind component.\n\n1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:46.160\n People are after me trying to get me.\n\n1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:48.400\n You can assign motive to other people.\n\n1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.600\n I'm afraid, but it's because there's an expectation.\n\n1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:55.180\n That doesn't tend to happen in slow wave sleep dreams.\n\n1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:57.080\n Now, all this of course is by waking people up\n\n1:26:57.080 --> 1:26:58.640\n and asking them what they were dreaming about,\n\n1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:01.520\n which from a standpoint of a AI guy\n\n1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:04.640\n or a machine learning or a neuroscientist kind of like,\n\n1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:06.320\n but it's the best we've got.\n\n1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:08.980\n But brain imaging in waking states\n\n1:27:08.980 --> 1:27:10.320\n while people view a movie\n\n1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:12.340\n and then brain imaging while people are sleeping\n\n1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:15.360\n supports the idea that that's basically what's going on.\n\n1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:17.260\n So REM sleep is amazing\n\n1:27:17.260 --> 1:27:18.600\n and you're not going to get much of it\n\n1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:21.360\n during your bout with Goggins,\n\n1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:22.920\n but you will afterward.\n\n1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:26.560\n Why, so to comment, why won't I?\n\n1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:30.360\n So is it not possible to get into it real quick?\n\n1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:32.900\n Only if you're very, very sleep deprived,\n\n1:27:32.900 --> 1:27:36.040\n but because you're going to be at high muscular output,\n\n1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:37.000\n that's going to bias you\n\n1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.720\n towards more slow wave sleep overall.\n\n1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:43.440\n And your body and brain are smart.\n\n1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:44.720\n They, it will know,\n\n1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:47.960\n they will know that your main goal is to recover\n\n1:27:49.300 --> 1:27:50.300\n so you can keep going.\n\n1:27:50.300 --> 1:27:52.600\n So you can keep firing neuromuscular contractions\n\n1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:54.840\n and you can keep running so that you can,\n\n1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:57.920\n I mean, it's amazing to think like, why do we ever stop?\n\n1:27:57.920 --> 1:27:58.960\n Unlike weight training\n\n1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:03.140\n where I can't do a 500 pound deadlift, I just can't.\n\n1:28:03.140 --> 1:28:03.980\n I could train for it,\n\n1:28:03.980 --> 1:28:07.300\n but I certainly can't do a 600 pound, I can't do that.\n\n1:28:07.300 --> 1:28:10.860\n What causes us to stop an endurance event\n\n1:28:10.860 --> 1:28:12.800\n is usually not a physical barrier.\n\n1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:15.600\n It's almost always a purely mental barrier.\n\n1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:17.800\n And that's a very interesting problem.\n\n1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:19.680\n I mean, neuroscientists don't tend to think about\n\n1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:20.760\n those sorts of problems\n\n1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:23.880\n because it sounds so non neuroscientific,\n\n1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:27.680\n but that's fundamentally related to the question of,\n\n1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:29.520\n what is pursuit?\n\n1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.240\n What is the desire to push and to carry on?\n\n1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:34.840\n Is there a neuroscientific answer\n\n1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:36.040\n for that question you think?\n\n1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:38.360\n I think the closest thing is this paper\n\n1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:42.440\n from Janelia Farms, the Howard Hughes campus,\n\n1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:45.440\n showing that if you put animals\n\n1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:47.740\n into a simulated environment\n\n1:28:47.740 --> 1:28:50.120\n where you can measure their effort,\n\n1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:51.680\n the forces while they're running,\n\n1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:53.960\n and you can control the visual environment,\n\n1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.080\n and you can create a scenario\n\n1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:58.120\n where the animal thinks that its output is futile.\n\n1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:01.060\n It knows it's running and it's actually running,\n\n1:29:01.060 --> 1:29:03.000\n but you change the frequency of the stripes\n\n1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000\n going by in their visual world,\n\n1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.280\n such that they think they're not getting anywhere,\n\n1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:09.280\n and eventually they quit.\n\n1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:11.560\n And the thing that determines whether or not they quit\n\n1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:14.520\n is a threshold level of epinephrine in the brainstem.\n\n1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:16.100\n If you drop that level back down\n\n1:29:16.100 --> 1:29:19.360\n or you give the animals dopamine, essentially,\n\n1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:20.440\n they keep going.\n\n1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:22.540\n If you take dopamine down,\n\n1:29:22.540 --> 1:29:26.120\n they're like, this isn't worth it, it's helpless.\n\n1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:27.720\n This isn't worth my time and energy.\n\n1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:28.880\n Well, this is where the difference\n\n1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:32.840\n between humans and nonhuman animals is interesting,\n\n1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:35.360\n because it does feel like humans have an extra level\n\n1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:40.360\n of cognitive ability that might be relevant here.\n\n1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:44.840\n Well, you can pull from different time references.\n\n1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:46.640\n So if you're in that moment,\n\n1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:49.500\n you're going to need a kit of things to pull from.\n\n1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:52.720\n So you can think this is in honor of someone else\n\n1:29:52.720 --> 1:29:54.000\n that passed away,\n\n1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:58.240\n and you will find a gas reserve that's amazing, right?\n\n1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:00.140\n Now, whether or not mice are like,\n\n1:30:00.140 --> 1:30:02.360\n I remember my brother back in the other cage\n\n1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:05.080\n when I was a little mouse, we don't know.\n\n1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:08.480\n But it's very likely that they don't do that,\n\n1:30:08.480 --> 1:30:09.660\n that they're so present,\n\n1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:12.520\n they're in the experience of there and then and now,\n\n1:30:12.520 --> 1:30:16.000\n that they aren't able to extract from the past,\n\n1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:18.380\n and they're not able to project into the future,\n\n1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:19.760\n like how great it's gonna feel\n\n1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:23.600\n when I get to the end of this really lame VR corridor.\n\n1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:25.080\n I don't think they think about that.\n\n1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:28.680\n And think about like, if I quit now,\n\n1:30:28.680 --> 1:30:29.720\n how will that have,\n\n1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:31.740\n what kind of effect will it have on the rest of my life\n\n1:30:31.740 --> 1:30:33.560\n in the future difficult times?\n\n1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:35.160\n Like if you allow yourself to quit\n\n1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:36.260\n in this particular moment,\n\n1:30:36.260 --> 1:30:38.240\n you'll become a quitter more and more in life,\n\n1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:41.480\n and then you're going to not get the other nice,\n\n1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:45.000\n the opposite sex mammals.\n\n1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:46.920\n That's pretty severe, you went there.\n\n1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:48.120\n I don't know.\n\n1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:50.280\n You took it the whole way to evolution and back again.\n\n1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:51.680\n I mean, but that's really it.\n\n1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:54.240\n I mean, our ability to time reference\n\n1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:56.120\n in the past, present or future.\n\n1:30:56.120 --> 1:30:59.340\n I do believe that we can be in the present and the past,\n\n1:30:59.340 --> 1:31:02.420\n or the present and the future, or only in the present,\n\n1:31:02.420 --> 1:31:04.200\n or only in the future, only in the past.\n\n1:31:04.200 --> 1:31:05.760\n But I don't think that we can really think\n\n1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:08.200\n about past, present and future all at once.\n\n1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:10.880\n And this has a similarity to covert attention.\n\n1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:13.760\n Like we can split our visual attention into two things.\n\n1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:16.840\n We really can do a task, even though we can't multitask.\n\n1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:18.640\n Or we can bring those two spotlights of attention\n\n1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:20.100\n to the same location.\n\n1:31:20.100 --> 1:31:23.200\n But it's very hard to split our attention in really well\n\n1:31:23.200 --> 1:31:26.580\n into three domains, excuse me, into three domains.\n\n1:31:26.580 --> 1:31:29.280\n I think that that's very, very challenging.\n\n1:31:29.280 --> 1:31:34.280\n And our time referencing scheme tends to be just one\n\n1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:36.960\n or two time references.\n\n1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:39.800\n So Lisa Feldman Barrett, I'm not sure\n\n1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:40.760\n if you've done work together,\n\n1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:41.680\n but at least you're connected.\n\n1:31:41.680 --> 1:31:43.800\n I found out about her because of you,\n\n1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:45.000\n on your podcast with her.\n\n1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:46.280\n And then I brought her on to Instagram,\n\n1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:48.360\n doing an Instagram live about emotion.\n\n1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:49.480\n And it was fascinating.\n\n1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:53.560\n And she's a very spirited and very, very smart woman.\n\n1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:55.360\n Fearless and brilliant.\n\n1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:57.920\n So I love her, she's amazing.\n\n1:31:57.920 --> 1:32:02.160\n She kind of, she's not a scholar of hallucinogens\n\n1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.720\n or dreams, but she had this intuition\n\n1:32:04.720 --> 1:32:09.320\n that there may be a connection between the kind\n\n1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:11.880\n of dissociation that happens in dreaming\n\n1:32:11.880 --> 1:32:16.880\n and that happens in like psychedelics.\n\n1:32:16.920 --> 1:32:20.440\n I, because of my previous conversation with you\n\n1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:25.040\n on this podcast, Matthew Johnson\n\n1:32:25.040 --> 1:32:28.040\n from Johns Hopkins reached out and he said,\n\n1:32:28.040 --> 1:32:32.720\n but he commented, I think, on something that we commented\n\n1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:34.280\n on, I don't even remember exactly what,\n\n1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:36.600\n but that there's not many studies.\n\n1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:40.760\n It's not being psychedelics and not being rigorously studied\n\n1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:44.680\n in an academic setting, like with a full rigor of science.\n\n1:32:44.680 --> 1:32:48.040\n And he said, well, actually that's exactly what we're doing\n\n1:32:48.040 --> 1:32:50.160\n and they're extremely well funded now.\n\n1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:53.000\n And it's been a long battle to get it accepted\n\n1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:55.760\n as a serious scientific pursuit.\n\n1:32:55.760 --> 1:33:00.000\n So, but, and I'd like to ask you a little bit about that,\n\n1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:04.160\n but do you have a sense about connection\n\n1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:07.680\n between dreams and psychedelics or these different\n\n1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:10.520\n explorations of mind states that are outside\n\n1:33:10.520 --> 1:33:14.480\n of the standard normal one, that's the wake mindset?\n\n1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:16.560\n Yeah, I loved your discussion with Matthew.\n\n1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:19.320\n I knew of the Hopkins group and the stuff they were doing,\n\n1:33:19.320 --> 1:33:21.800\n but I didn't know much about it at all.\n\n1:33:21.800 --> 1:33:23.480\n And I learned a ton from that podcast.\n\n1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:25.640\n I reached out to him just to say,\n\n1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:26.480\n I love what you're doing.\n\n1:33:26.480 --> 1:33:27.360\n I think it's incredible.\n\n1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:29.280\n So yeah, your podcast has been a great source\n\n1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:34.280\n of serious academic and intellectual conversation for me.\n\n1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:38.560\n I think what they're doing at Hopkins is amazing.\n\n1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:40.520\n He has a collaborator there actually\n\n1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:42.000\n that had a very popular paper.\n\n1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:43.520\n I just throw out there for fun,\n\n1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:46.320\n who is a postdoc at Stanford.\n\n1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:47.840\n Her name is Gul.\n\n1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:50.160\n She's Turkish, I believe.\n\n1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:54.520\n And I apologize, her last name escapes me at the moment,\n\n1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:57.200\n but that's just a function of my brain.\n\n1:33:57.200 --> 1:34:01.640\n She had a paper showing that she put octopi on MDMA\n\n1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:04.000\n on ecstasy and found out, this is published\n\n1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:07.200\n in current biology, it was a great journal,\n\n1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.000\n showing that the octopi then wanted to spend more time\n\n1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.560\n with other octopi and they started cuddling.\n\n1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:14.800\n So they're colleagues out there.\n\n1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:19.080\n But the Hopkins project is super interesting\n\n1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:21.680\n because I think they were initially supported mainly\n\n1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:23.200\n through private philanthropy.\n\n1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:25.480\n And now you're starting to see some more interest\n\n1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:28.960\n at the level of NIH about psychedelics.\n\n1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:32.280\n It's a complicated space because the psychedelics\n\n1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:36.280\n are always looked at through the lens of the 60s\n\n1:34:36.280 --> 1:34:37.640\n and people losing their mind.\n\n1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:40.600\n And there's a, I always say,\n\n1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:42.600\n you don't want a Ken Kesey out of the game.\n\n1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:43.840\n Ken Kesey was amazing, right,\n\n1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:45.320\n part of the whole beat generation thing.\n\n1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:48.200\n And he was actually at the VA near Stanford.\n\n1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:49.560\n That's where he eventually, in Menlo Park,\n\n1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:51.200\n he wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\n\n1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:52.360\n or maybe that was about him.\n\n1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:55.160\n Anyway, the comments will tell me how wrong I am,\n\n1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:57.040\n but I think I'm tossing these words\n\n1:34:57.040 --> 1:34:59.640\n in the right general direction.\n\n1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:04.640\n But Huxley, Kesey, they did a lot of LSD\n\n1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:08.320\n and they all lost their jobs, right?\n\n1:35:08.320 --> 1:35:10.040\n They lost their jobs at big institutions\n\n1:35:10.040 --> 1:35:13.480\n like Harvard and Stanford and elsewhere, or they left\n\n1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:18.040\n because they made themselves the experiments.\n\n1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:21.160\n Hopkins, as far as I know, is one of the first places,\n\n1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:23.960\n if not the first place, where whatever Matt\n\n1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:26.560\n may or may not be doing in his own life, I don't know.\n\n1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:27.760\n It's really about the patients\n\n1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:29.160\n and whether or not the patients\n\n1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:32.840\n in these institutional review board approved studies,\n\n1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:34.200\n whether or not they're getting better\n\n1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:35.800\n in situations like depression.\n\n1:35:35.800 --> 1:35:40.240\n I think it's clear that there's a very close relationship\n\n1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:43.280\n between hallucinogenic states and dreaming\n\n1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:45.680\n of the sort that were described for REM dreaming.\n\n1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:48.400\n And there's a terrific set of books\n\n1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:49.880\n and body of scientific literature\n\n1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:51.560\n from a guy named Allan Hobson,\n\n1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:53.680\n who was an MD, is at Harvard Med,\n\n1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:56.360\n and he wrote books like Dream Drugstore.\n\n1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.000\n One of the first neuroscience books I ever read\n\n1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.760\n was about hallucinations and how psychedelics\n\n1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:02.280\n and dreaming are very similar.\n\n1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:03.480\n That was way back when I was in high school.\n\n1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:04.800\n I was just curious.\n\n1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:07.040\n And he really understood the relationship\n\n1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:10.960\n between LSD and REM dreams and how similar they are.\n\n1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:14.520\n I think psychedelics, and Matt knows way more about this\n\n1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:17.400\n than I do, of course, but psychedelics\n\n1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:19.640\n have some very interesting properties.\n\n1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:21.640\n They are certainly not for everybody, right?\n\n1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:23.920\n And kids, it's a problem.\n\n1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:25.640\n I think the major issues right now\n\n1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:29.240\n around the psychedelic conversation is that it's clear\n\n1:36:29.240 --> 1:36:33.040\n that they can unveil certain elements of neuroplasticity.\n\n1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:35.520\n They make the brain amenable to change,\n\n1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:37.400\n changing up space time relationships,\n\n1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:39.760\n changing up the emotional load of an event\n\n1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:41.480\n and being able to reframe that.\n\n1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:43.240\n It's clear that happens.\n\n1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:45.160\n But there's two major issues.\n\n1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:47.960\n One is that people talk about plasticity\n\n1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:50.200\n as if plasticity is the goal,\n\n1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:52.200\n but plasticity is a state within which\n\n1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:53.640\n you can direct neurology.\n\n1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:56.800\n And the question is what changes are you trying to get to?\n\n1:36:56.800 --> 1:36:58.640\n So people are just taking psychedelics\n\n1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:02.160\n to unveil plasticity without thinking about\n\n1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:04.600\n what circuits they want to modify and how.\n\n1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:06.360\n I think that's a problem.\n\n1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:08.440\n I think there's great potential, however,\n\n1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:12.240\n for people opening up these states of plasticity\n\n1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:13.520\n with psychedelics or otherwise,\n\n1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:16.180\n and directing the plastic changes\n\n1:37:16.180 --> 1:37:17.480\n toward a particular end point.\n\n1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:20.280\n And there's an absolutely spectacular paper\n\n1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:23.800\n out of UC Davis published as a full article in Nature\n\n1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:25.400\n just a couple of months ago,\n\n1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:28.380\n showing that there are psychedelics\n\n1:37:28.380 --> 1:37:30.100\n that are now can be modified.\n\n1:37:30.100 --> 1:37:31.880\n So chemists have gotten into the game now\n\n1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:34.440\n and modifying to take away the hallucinogenic component\n\n1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:37.760\n where you still get the neuroplasticity components.\n\n1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:40.460\n And for a lot of people it'd be like, oh, that's no fun.\n\n1:37:40.460 --> 1:37:43.140\n That's not giving you the wild experience.\n\n1:37:43.140 --> 1:37:45.140\n But I do think that that holds great potential\n\n1:37:45.140 --> 1:37:47.760\n for people that wouldn't otherwise orient\n\n1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:48.740\n towards some of these drugs.\n\n1:37:48.740 --> 1:37:51.360\n So I think it's really marvelous what's happening\n\n1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:52.600\n and what's about to happen.\n\n1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:57.500\n And I think there is one drug in that kit of drugs\n\n1:37:57.500 --> 1:38:00.880\n that's very unusual, like psilocybin, LSD,\n\n1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:04.160\n those promote heavy, heavy serotonin release\n\n1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:06.940\n and lateralized connections ramp up, et cetera.\n\n1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:08.320\n Matt talked about all that.\n\n1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:13.280\n But MDMA, ecstasy, is a very unusual situation\n\n1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:16.120\n where dopamine is very, very high\n\n1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.840\n because of the way the drug is designed.\n\n1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:21.100\n Dopamine release, it goes through the roof.\n\n1:38:21.100 --> 1:38:23.880\n So people feel great and they want to move\n\n1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:25.320\n and they have a lot of energy.\n\n1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:27.640\n But serotonin levels are also high\n\n1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:30.420\n and that's a very unnatural state.\n\n1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:35.040\n And why MDMA may, and I want to highlight may,\n\n1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:38.280\n have particularly high potential\n\n1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:41.400\n for the treatment of certain forms of depression\n\n1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:43.160\n is an interesting question.\n\n1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:47.640\n Because never before, as far as we know in human history,\n\n1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.440\n has there been a possibility of opening up dopaminergic\n\n1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:53.080\n and serotonergic states at the same time,\n\n1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:55.180\n dopamine being the molecule pursuit and reward\n\n1:38:55.180 --> 1:38:58.640\n and more and more, and serotonin being one of bliss\n\n1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:00.100\n and being content right where you're at.\n\n1:39:00.100 --> 1:39:02.400\n So it's almost like those two things wrap back on themselves\n\n1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:04.520\n and create this very unusual state.\n\n1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:06.360\n And I think the bigger conversation\n\n1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:08.160\n is what to do with a state like that.\n\n1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:11.280\n Like is it about self love?\n\n1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:13.480\n Is it about developing love for another person?\n\n1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:15.280\n Is it about forgetting hate?\n\n1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:17.240\n Like these are powerful molecules.\n\n1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:19.240\n And I think if the academic community\n\n1:39:19.240 --> 1:39:20.880\n and the clinical community is going to move forward\n\n1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:22.600\n with them in any serious way,\n\n1:39:22.600 --> 1:39:24.400\n I think there needs to be a conversation\n\n1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:28.360\n about what they're being used for.\n\n1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:30.480\n Right, and coupled with that,\n\n1:39:30.480 --> 1:39:32.840\n I think similar to what you're saying,\n\n1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:34.060\n like Matt has talked about,\n\n1:39:34.060 --> 1:39:35.820\n as others have talked about,\n\n1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:39.980\n some of the biggest benefits of like progress,\n\n1:39:39.980 --> 1:39:41.360\n whether it's like quitting smoking\n\n1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:45.280\n and all this kind of stuff is in the days after,\n\n1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:47.600\n it's the integration of the experience.\n\n1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:50.680\n So maybe you open up the brain to the neuroplasticity,\n\n1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:52.320\n but then there's like work to be done.\n\n1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:57.320\n It's not, you shake up something in the biology of the brain\n\n1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.100\n but you have to do then it's work.\n\n1:40:00.100 --> 1:40:03.440\n Absolutely, a friend of mine who's a physician,\n\n1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:06.600\n he says, who's quite open to this idea\n\n1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:10.400\n that psychedelics could play a real role in real medicine.\n\n1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:12.240\n Says, better living through chemistry\n\n1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:14.440\n still requires better living.\n\n1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:16.560\n And I think it's a beautiful statement.\n\n1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:19.920\n I wish I had said it, but he gets the credit.\n\n1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:22.640\n But the plasticity window opens.\n\n1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:24.640\n And then as you said, what are you going to do in the two\n\n1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:26.400\n weeks, three weeks, four weeks afterward?\n\n1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:28.300\n Because that's the real opportunity.\n\n1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:30.680\n But those psychedelic experiences are really a case\n\n1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:33.160\n of an amplified experience inside of an amplified\n\n1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:36.840\n experience so much so that everything seems relevant.\n\n1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:39.800\n And it's fascinating.\n\n1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:43.980\n I mean, my hope is that the AI and machine learning\n\n1:40:43.980 --> 1:40:45.640\n and the brain machine interface and all that\n\n1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:49.620\n will eventually be merged with the psychedelic treatments\n\n1:40:49.620 --> 1:40:52.320\n so that an individual can go in,\n\n1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:55.000\n take whatever amount of whatever's safe for them,\n\n1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.600\n working with a clinician and really direct the plasticity\n\n1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:01.960\n while maybe stimulating the medial frontal cortex\n\n1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:04.640\n or increasing the observer or decreasing the observer\n\n1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:06.480\n in the brain or decreasing the amygdala.\n\n1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:07.960\n I mean, it's doable.\n\n1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:11.080\n It's doable with transcranial magnetic stimulation\n\n1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:12.720\n and it's for shutting down activity\n\n1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:14.600\n and it's doable with ultrasound.\n\n1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:17.440\n Ultrasound now allows very focal activation\n\n1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:19.940\n of particular brain regions through the skull,\n\n1:41:19.940 --> 1:41:21.040\n noninvasively.\n\n1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:23.960\n So it's approaching the same kind of therapy\n\n1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:24.880\n from different angles.\n\n1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:28.440\n One AI is the computational size of injecting\n\n1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:32.400\n like the robotics injecting like maybe you can even think\n\n1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:35.760\n about it as like electricity, the electrical approach\n\n1:41:35.760 --> 1:41:38.600\n versus then like the chemical approach.\n\n1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:39.440\n Absolutely.\n\n1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:42.800\n And then the psychology is subjective, right?\n\n1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:45.960\n So it's gonna take some real understanding\n\n1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:49.540\n of what that person's lexicon is.\n\n1:41:49.540 --> 1:41:51.520\n Like, you know, that wasn't a pun, sorry.\n\n1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:55.120\n I'm sorry, it's terrible, I'm like the worst.\n\n1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:57.380\n That's the one thing I know from the feedback on my podcast.\n\n1:41:57.380 --> 1:42:00.080\n My jokes are terrible, but I never claimed to be funny.\n\n1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:04.720\n But somebody who they really trust\n\n1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:08.160\n and understands when somebody says, you know,\n\n1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:10.520\n for a very stoic person, like I'm imagining\n\n1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:12.760\n you interviewed the great Dan Gable, right?\n\n1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:13.880\n I don't know anything about Dan,\n\n1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:15.520\n but can you imagine like you ask Dan,\n\n1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:17.040\n like, you know, how you feel about something\n\n1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:18.320\n while on one of these drugs?\n\n1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:21.720\n And like, I mean, his languaging might,\n\n1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:24.280\n if he says that was troubling,\n\n1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:26.000\n it might mean that it was very troubling\n\n1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.360\n or not troubling at all.\n\n1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:31.300\n So people are, language is a poor guide\n\n1:42:31.300 --> 1:42:33.720\n because if I say I'm upset, how upset is that?\n\n1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:35.360\n Well, that's very subjective.\n\n1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:38.400\n So you need, we need, can you build a tool for that?\n\n1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:39.720\n Can you build an AI tool for that?\n\n1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:40.840\n Yeah, deeper, yeah, well.\n\n1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:43.380\n Maybe that's the eye, maybe that's our,\n\n1:42:43.380 --> 1:42:44.920\n that's what the eyes could reveal.\n\n1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:47.400\n So language is not just words, it's everything together.\n\n1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:50.480\n And that's one of the fascinating things about the eyes\n\n1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:51.520\n and the window to the soul.\n\n1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:54.360\n I mean, they express so much, the face, the eyes,\n\n1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:57.600\n the body, I mean, Lisa talks about that,\n\n1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:01.120\n the communication of emotions, it's a super complex.\n\n1:43:01.120 --> 1:43:04.880\n Perhaps it's a bit of a side fun tangent,\n\n1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:09.880\n but Matt, Matthew Johnson brings up DMT\n\n1:43:10.400 --> 1:43:15.400\n and the experience of DMT is from a scientific perspective,\n\n1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:20.360\n just a mystery in itself over its intensity\n\n1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:21.880\n of what happens to the brain.\n\n1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:25.760\n And of course, Joe Rogan and others bring it up\n\n1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:30.360\n as a very different special kind of experience\n\n1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:34.880\n and elves seem to come up often.\n\n1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:38.740\n I've never tried DMT, what allows for hallucinogenic states?\n\n1:43:38.740 --> 1:43:41.960\n And it, I mean, DMT is a really interesting molecule.\n\n1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:46.960\n There are a lot of people experimenting now with DMT\n\n1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:51.960\n and the way they've described it is as a kind of a freight\n\n1:43:54.320 --> 1:43:56.760\n train through space and time, very different\n\n1:43:56.760 --> 1:43:59.040\n than the way people describe LSD type experiences\n\n1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:02.160\n or psilocybin where time and space are very fluid,\n\n1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:05.340\n but it tends to be a kind of a slower role, if you will.\n\n1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:10.240\n So it's clear that DMT is tapping into a brain state\n\n1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:13.860\n that's distinctly different than the other psychedelics.\n\n1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:17.920\n And you mentioned jujitsu and these other communities.\n\n1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:21.600\n I mean, I think it's interesting because jujitsu\n\n1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:24.260\n is a nonverbal activity and people get together\n\n1:44:24.260 --> 1:44:26.360\n and talk about this nonverbal activity\n\n1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:28.180\n and they show great love for it in the same way\n\n1:44:28.180 --> 1:44:32.020\n that surfers, I've known some surfers in my time\n\n1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:35.040\n and they will get up at the crack of dawn\n\n1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:37.140\n and drive really, really far to sit in the water\n\n1:44:37.140 --> 1:44:38.200\n and wait for this wave to come.\n\n1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:40.880\n I have to imagine it's pretty fantastic.\n\n1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:44.640\n I think that human beings now,\n\n1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:46.400\n some of whom are in the scientific community\n\n1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:48.800\n are starting to feel comfortable enough to talk about\n\n1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:51.360\n some of these other loves and other endeavors\n\n1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:54.080\n because they do reveal a certain component\n\n1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:55.960\n about our underlying neurology.\n\n1:44:55.960 --> 1:45:00.960\n I'm fascinated by the concept of wordlessness,\n\n1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:04.920\n activities in which language is just not sufficient\n\n1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:09.560\n to capture and in which feel so vital as a reset,\n\n1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:11.680\n as important as sleep.\n\n1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:13.360\n I think that's one of the dangers of the phone\n\n1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:15.480\n is not that you're going to get into some online battle\n\n1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:16.680\n or that you're always staring at the phone\n\n1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:17.960\n is that it's a words.\n\n1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:20.800\n As we read things, we're hearing the script in our head.\n\n1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:23.500\n And I think getting into states\n\n1:45:23.500 --> 1:45:26.480\n where we are in a state of wordlessness\n\n1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:31.480\n is very renewing and replenishing and just can feel amazing.\n\n1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:36.080\n And I believe also can help us tap into creative states\n\n1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:38.600\n and allow our neurology to access creative states.\n\n1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:42.800\n And sleep is one such wordlessness, period.\n\n1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:45.880\n So one of the most interesting things to me\n\n1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:48.360\n are states that one can approach in waking,\n\n1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:51.800\n non sleep depressed, wordlessness through,\n\n1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:54.200\n maybe it's jujitsu, maybe it's for some people surfing,\n\n1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:56.240\n maybe it's dancing, maybe it's just,\n\n1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:58.260\n I don't know, staring at a wall, who knows?\n\n1:45:58.260 --> 1:46:01.400\n But where the language components of the brain\n\n1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:03.240\n are completely shut down.\n\n1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:06.560\n And it has to be the case that drugs are no drugs,\n\n1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:10.640\n that the brain is entering and starting to states\n\n1:46:10.640 --> 1:46:12.120\n and starting to use algorithms\n\n1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:13.240\n that are distinctly different\n\n1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:15.540\n than when we're trying to compose things\n\n1:46:15.540 --> 1:46:17.800\n in any kind of coherent way for someone else to understand.\n\n1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:20.200\n There's no interest in anyone else understanding\n\n1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:22.360\n what you're experiencing in that moment.\n\n1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:23.560\n And that's beautiful.\n\n1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:27.760\n And I think it's not just beautiful because it feels good.\n\n1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:29.800\n I think it's beautiful because it's important\n\n1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:32.760\n and it's clearly fundamental to our neurology.\n\n1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:35.860\n And your sense is there's a connection between dreams\n\n1:46:35.860 --> 1:46:37.160\n and DMT and like psychedelic,\n\n1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:41.680\n like all of the, you can understand one\n\n1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:42.680\n by studying the other.\n\n1:46:42.680 --> 1:46:46.240\n So for example, dreams are also very difficult to study,\n\n1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:48.240\n but they're more accessible.\n\n1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:49.920\n It's safer to study.\n\n1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:51.880\n And we're told we need to get more of it.\n\n1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:54.380\n Whereas with psychedelics, there's this big question mark.\n\n1:46:54.380 --> 1:46:56.300\n Is it gonna make everyone crazy?\n\n1:46:56.300 --> 1:46:58.060\n Is it gonna be legal?\n\n1:46:58.060 --> 1:47:00.120\n I mean, it's kind of interesting how,\n\n1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:02.400\n if one looks on Instagram,\n\n1:47:02.400 --> 1:47:04.800\n one could almost think that these drugs are already legal\n\n1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:06.800\n based on the way that people commute, but they're not yet.\n\n1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:08.320\n There's still a lot of them are scheduled.\n\n1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:10.480\n And there's a lot of questions.\n\n1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:13.560\n I mean, but nevertheless, it's like,\n\n1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:18.640\n my hope is that science opens up\n\n1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:21.800\n to these drugs a little bit more.\n\n1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:24.420\n It's just, I have this intuition that,\n\n1:47:24.420 --> 1:47:25.780\n like a lot of people share,\n\n1:47:25.780 --> 1:47:30.780\n that they would be able to unlock deeper understanding\n\n1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:31.800\n of our own mind.\n\n1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:34.840\n It's any kind of, same as studying dreams.\n\n1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:35.680\n Absolutely.\n\n1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:39.360\n Well, creativity is in the nonlinearities, right?\n\n1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:43.120\n But productivity is in the implementation of linearities.\n\n1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:45.760\n I mean, that's what is absolutely clear.\n\n1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:47.320\n This is why I think we were talking earlier\n\n1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:49.920\n about why a formal rigorous training in something\n\n1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:51.200\n where other people are looking at you\n\n1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:52.640\n and telling you, no, not good enough,\n\n1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:54.020\n go back and do it again.\n\n1:47:54.020 --> 1:47:55.320\n There's real value to that\n\n1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:57.080\n because otherwise it's just ideas.\n\n1:47:57.080 --> 1:47:58.560\n It's just vapors.\n\n1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:01.240\n You know, one thing that Matt mentioned\n\n1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:04.920\n as the study that they're working on is,\n\n1:48:04.920 --> 1:48:07.680\n as opposed to, I think most of the psychedelic studies\n\n1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:12.040\n they've done is on how to treat different conditions.\n\n1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:13.680\n And one of the things they're working on now\n\n1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:18.160\n is to try to do a study where, for creatives,\n\n1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:20.200\n for people that don't have a condition\n\n1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:21.040\n that they're trying to treat,\n\n1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:23.840\n but instead see how this,\n\n1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:26.000\n how psychedelics can help you create.\n\n1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:26.840\n So like.\n\n1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:27.660\n Goodness.\n\n1:48:27.660 --> 1:48:29.740\n If you take creatives and you give them more psychedelics,\n\n1:48:29.740 --> 1:48:31.680\n they're not gonna be able to get out of their room.\n\n1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:32.640\n I don't know.\n\n1:48:32.640 --> 1:48:34.400\n Well, but this is the,\n\n1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:37.320\n maybe you can speak to that, psychedelics or not,\n\n1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:40.600\n or dreams or tools in general, how to be better creatives.\n\n1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:42.080\n That's an interesting,\n\n1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:44.680\n I don't often see studies of this nature\n\n1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:47.000\n of like how to take high performers\n\n1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.840\n in the mental creative space\n\n1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:53.680\n and get them to perform even better.\n\n1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:55.640\n So it's not average people.\n\n1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:58.860\n It's like masters of their craft, like taking,\n\n1:48:58.860 --> 1:49:01.480\n I mean, his examples was taking an Elon Musk,\n\n1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:04.240\n which is in the engineering space and maybe musicians\n\n1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:06.520\n and all that kind of stuff and studying that.\n\n1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:09.520\n That's a, I mean, that's weird.\n\n1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:13.680\n Usually the science, the scientific exploration there\n\n1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:16.800\n has been done by the musicians themselves,\n\n1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:17.920\n as has been documented.\n\n1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:21.380\n Like jazz is like all nonlinearities, right?\n\n1:49:21.380 --> 1:49:23.660\n But if it's, but the people still have to know\n\n1:49:23.660 --> 1:49:25.760\n how to play their instruments, right?\n\n1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:29.600\n There's some early skill building that's critical.\n\n1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:32.120\n I mean, when you mentioned someone like Elon,\n\n1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:34.600\n I mean, virtual, I mean, he's already a virtuoso, right?\n\n1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:36.440\n Cause he, and in so many different domains,\n\n1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:39.240\n I've never met him, but it's clear, right?\n\n1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:42.880\n He, it's not just that he's ambitious and bold and brave\n\n1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:44.280\n and all that, it's all that.\n\n1:49:44.280 --> 1:49:49.160\n And there's clearly a different way of looking\n\n1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:51.560\n at the same problems that everyone else is looking at.\n\n1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:53.320\n And people are probably banging their head\n\n1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:55.200\n against the refrigerator thinking like, think differently,\n\n1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:56.800\n think it doesn't work that way.\n\n1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:00.400\n It involves, there's a certain anxiety in for the,\n\n1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:03.860\n I'm not talking about for Elon, but I don't have no idea.\n\n1:50:03.860 --> 1:50:06.800\n But I think for somebody who's very structured,\n\n1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:08.600\n very regimented, very linear,\n\n1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:12.060\n the anxiety comes from letting go of those linearities.\n\n1:50:12.060 --> 1:50:14.080\n And for the person that's very creative,\n\n1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:18.240\n the anxiety comes from trying to impose linearities, right?\n\n1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:21.680\n The really creative artists or musician, they're,\n\n1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:22.840\n they seem nuts.\n\n1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:24.520\n They seem like they can't get their life together\n\n1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:26.040\n because they can't.\n\n1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:28.600\n And they, you know, we look at people who are kind of\n\n1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:31.320\n pseudo Asperger's or Asperger's or some forms of autism\n\n1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:33.120\n and they are so hyper linear,\n\n1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:36.480\n but you take away those linearities and they freak out.\n\n1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:39.080\n And that's kind of the essence of some of those syndromes.\n\n1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:42.380\n So I think that the ability to toggle back and forth\n\n1:50:42.380 --> 1:50:44.120\n between those states is what's remarkable.\n\n1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:46.400\n I mean, because we're here and we're having this discussion,\n\n1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:48.180\n I mean, Steve Jobs is a good example.\n\n1:50:48.180 --> 1:50:49.980\n He probably the best example,\n\n1:50:49.980 --> 1:50:52.680\n somebody who actually talked about his own process,\n\n1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:54.880\n about the merging of art and science,\n\n1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:57.800\n art and engineering, humanities and science.\n\n1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:00.080\n Very few people can do that.\n\n1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:03.240\n Well, you seem to have a capacity to do that.\n\n1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:06.320\n Like you know poetry and you are AI guy,\n\n1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:08.680\n like you, there's nothing linear about poetry\n\n1:51:08.680 --> 1:51:09.760\n as far as I can tell.\n\n1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:12.660\n I mean, I do wonder, just like we've been talking about,\n\n1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:15.160\n if there's any ways to push that to its limits\n\n1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:17.680\n to explore further.\n\n1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:20.280\n I don't like leaning, this is why I'm bothered\n\n1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:22.400\n there's not more science and psychedelics is,\n\n1:51:22.400 --> 1:51:24.720\n I haven't done almost,\n\n1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:29.720\n so I've eaten mushrooms a few times allegedly,\n\n1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:31.720\n but that's it.\n\n1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:33.500\n And the reason I don't do more,\n\n1:51:33.500 --> 1:51:36.400\n the reason I haven't done DMT is because it's illegal\n\n1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:39.480\n and it's like not well studied.\n\n1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:42.480\n And I'm in those things,\n\n1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:45.280\n I'm not usually at the cutting edge, but I'm very curious.\n\n1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:49.480\n And it feels like there could be tools\n\n1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:51.960\n to be discovered there, not for fun,\n\n1:51:51.960 --> 1:51:56.960\n not for recreation, but for like encouraging\n\n1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:00.000\n whether you're a linear thinking to go nonlinear\n\n1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:03.520\n or it's nonlinear to go linear, like to shake things up.\n\n1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:05.060\n You mentioned Dan Gable,\n\n1:52:05.060 --> 1:52:07.760\n the idea of Dan Gable on psychedelics is fascinating to me\n\n1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:11.200\n because he's such a control freak.\n\n1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:12.200\n I mean, he likes control.\n\n1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:13.640\n That I would show up for.\n\n1:52:13.640 --> 1:52:15.240\n That I would show up for.\n\n1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:17.640\n But like so much of these psychedelic experiences\n\n1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:19.840\n it feels like is for letting go.\n\n1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:20.680\n That's right.\n\n1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:21.500\n You don't wanna resist.\n\n1:52:21.500 --> 1:52:23.920\n That's supposedly where the growth is\n\n1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:27.520\n in giving oneself over to the process.\n\n1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:31.360\n And that's for people who are like master controllers.\n\n1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:33.140\n He's one of the greatest coaches of all time.\n\n1:52:33.140 --> 1:52:35.760\n It's fascinating to see what that battle looks like\n\n1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:38.680\n of resistance and then of letting go.\n\n1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:43.680\n Yeah, I mean, I can't wait to see where these studies take us.\n\n1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:45.560\n Well, it's clearly happening.\n\n1:52:45.560 --> 1:52:46.440\n You know, I've asked there,\n\n1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:47.680\n I have a couple of colleagues at Stanford\n\n1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:49.360\n who are doing animal studies.\n\n1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:51.460\n I've asked around, you know, it's,\n\n1:52:51.460 --> 1:52:54.240\n there's a lot of discussion in the neuroscience community\n\n1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:56.820\n about what the perception of a laboratory is\n\n1:52:56.820 --> 1:52:59.480\n if they work on psychedelics.\n\n1:52:59.480 --> 1:53:02.860\n I mean, I have to tip my hat to the folks at Hopkins.\n\n1:53:02.860 --> 1:53:04.080\n They are pioneers.\n\n1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:06.000\n And as Terry Signowski,\n\n1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.600\n he's a computational neuroscientist down at Salk says,\n\n1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:09.920\n I don't think he was the first person to say it.\n\n1:53:09.920 --> 1:53:12.600\n He says, you know how to spot the pioneers?\n\n1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:14.520\n They're the ones with the arrows in their backs.\n\n1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:15.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:19.920\n And you know, it's an unkind world to a scientist\n\n1:53:19.920 --> 1:53:22.020\n that's trying to do really cutting edge stuff.\n\n1:53:22.020 --> 1:53:25.120\n My colleague, David Spiegel who studies medical hypnosis,\n\n1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:28.720\n he's got dozens of studies now showing that hypnosis\n\n1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:30.440\n can be beneficial for pain management,\n\n1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:32.440\n anxiety management, cancer outcomes.\n\n1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:34.280\n And it's finally, you know,\n\n1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:36.920\n at the point where there's so much data,\n\n1:53:36.920 --> 1:53:39.400\n but people hear hypnosis and they think of stage hypnosis,\n\n1:53:39.400 --> 1:53:42.040\n which is like the furthest thing from what he's doing.\n\n1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:45.720\n And I think mind, body type stuff,\n\n1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:48.440\n hypnosis, respiration and breathing.\n\n1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:52.560\n I think the hard science walk into the problem\n\n1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:55.920\n is always going to be best to get the community on board.\n\n1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:58.120\n And then it's up to people like Matt\n\n1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:01.720\n and to really, you know, take it to the next level.\n\n1:54:01.720 --> 1:54:03.800\n And as I say, not Keezy out of the game\n\n1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:07.300\n because Keezy basically was taking too much of his own stuff\n\n1:54:07.300 --> 1:54:09.400\n and he started dressing crazy of banana hats.\n\n1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:11.720\n And like, you see him, he had the magic bus.\n\n1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:14.320\n So, you know, the day I start driving to work\n\n1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:17.640\n in the magic bus, that's the day I lose my job.\n\n1:54:17.640 --> 1:54:21.000\n I'm not into buses or wearing fruit, but.\n\n1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.320\n You're going to get a phone call from me\n\n1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:23.600\n and I hope you do the same for me.\n\n1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:26.680\n It's like, dude, what are you doing?\n\n1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:28.040\n Well, what's interesting earlier,\n\n1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:29.520\n we were talking about the challenge with David\n\n1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:30.560\n that you're about to do.\n\n1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:34.600\n I mean, that is a psychedelic experience of sorts\n\n1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:36.240\n because you're biasing your mind\n\n1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:38.720\n towards a pretty extreme neurochemical state.\n\n1:54:38.720 --> 1:54:40.720\n And you don't know what you're going to find there.\n\n1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:42.160\n And that's kind of the excitement,\n\n1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:43.640\n at least for me as an observer.\n\n1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:47.680\n It's like, I want to know what the experience\n\n1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:49.520\n is like afterward.\n\n1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:51.120\n I want to know like, how was it?\n\n1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:52.720\n I mean, I'm sure you're going to get something.\n\n1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:53.920\n Like you said, you're going to grow.\n\n1:54:53.920 --> 1:54:54.860\n The question is how.\n\n1:54:54.860 --> 1:54:55.820\n And not resisting.\n\n1:54:55.820 --> 1:54:57.840\n I mean, it's the same as with the psychedelic experience.\n\n1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:01.440\n It's like not like giving yourself over completely\n\n1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:03.360\n to the experience and not resisting\n\n1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:05.020\n and going through the whole mental journey\n\n1:55:05.020 --> 1:55:08.720\n of whether it's anger or excitement or exhaustion,\n\n1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:09.640\n the whole thing.\n\n1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:14.640\n That's, I mean, that's the entirety of the process\n\n1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:19.680\n that David goes through when he does his own challenges\n\n1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:21.440\n and so on is that whole journey.\n\n1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:26.440\n He finds purposely like missile seeks the limits\n\n1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:30.600\n of the mind that whenever the resistance is felt,\n\n1:55:30.600 --> 1:55:33.360\n runs up against it and then goes to the full journey\n\n1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:35.760\n of going beyond it and seeing what's there\n\n1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:36.600\n on the other side.\n\n1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:38.080\n Well, stress has these two sides,\n\n1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:40.120\n the limbic friction of being tired\n\n1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:41.720\n and needing to get more energized.\n\n1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:43.400\n That's one form of stress.\n\n1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:45.640\n And then there's the feeling too amped up\n\n1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:47.400\n and needing to calm down.\n\n1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:50.160\n The typical discussion around stress is one thing,\n\n1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:51.740\n but it's all limbic friction.\n\n1:55:51.740 --> 1:55:53.600\n It's just that when I say limbic friction,\n\n1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:54.900\n that's not a real scientific term.\n\n1:55:54.900 --> 1:55:57.160\n I just mean the limbic system wanting to pull you down\n\n1:55:57.160 --> 1:55:59.240\n into sleep or wanting to put you into panic\n\n1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:01.720\n and you using top down processing,\n\n1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:04.920\n using that evolved forebrain to say,\n\n1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:06.880\n I'm not going to go to sleep\n\n1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:09.120\n and I'm not going to freak out.\n\n1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.840\n And those top down control mechanisms are,\n\n1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:15.160\n I mean, when those get honed, that's beautiful\n\n1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:18.660\n because then you're increasing capacity for everything.\n\n1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:22.360\n This month on the podcast,\n\n1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:23.760\n you're talking about neuroplasticity.\n\n1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:25.260\n You mentioned a bunch already.\n\n1:56:25.260 --> 1:56:29.040\n Is there something you're looking forward to specifically,\n\n1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:31.920\n like something maybe you're fascinated by\n\n1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:34.720\n that jumps to mind about neuroplasticity,\n\n1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:37.620\n this fascinating property of the brain?\n\n1:56:37.620 --> 1:56:39.560\n Yeah, I think that it's clear\n\n1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:41.800\n there's one facet of neuroplasticity\n\n1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:45.360\n that is very well supported by the research data\n\n1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:48.760\n that hardly anyone has implemented in the real world.\n\n1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:51.600\n And that's the release of acetylcholine from these neurons\n\n1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:53.720\n in the forebrain called nucleus basalis.\n\n1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:56.000\n This is mainly the work of Mike Merzenich,\n\n1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:57.360\n who used to be at UCSF\n\n1:56:57.360 --> 1:56:59.060\n and some of his scientific offspring,\n\n1:56:59.060 --> 1:57:01.480\n Greg Reckensown and Michael Kilgard and others.\n\n1:57:01.480 --> 1:57:04.820\n What they showed was increases in acetylcholine,\n\n1:57:04.820 --> 1:57:07.560\n this molecule associated with focus,\n\n1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:11.920\n in concert, meaning at the same time as some event,\n\n1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:16.920\n motor event or music event or any kind of sensory event,\n\n1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:20.540\n immediately reorganizes the neocortex\n\n1:57:20.540 --> 1:57:22.800\n so that there's a permanent map representation\n\n1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:23.980\n of that event.\n\n1:57:23.980 --> 1:57:27.440\n And I absolutely believe that this can be channeled\n\n1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:29.980\n toward accelerated skill learning.\n\n1:57:29.980 --> 1:57:31.480\n And my friend and colleague, Eddie Chang,\n\n1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:34.760\n who's now the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,\n\n1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:37.720\n but also a fine scientist in his own right,\n\n1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:38.760\n not just a clinician,\n\n1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:42.560\n he's doing studies looking at rapid acquisition of language\n\n1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:43.680\n using these principles.\n\n1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:45.760\n He trained with Merzenich.\n\n1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:48.120\n It's clear we have these gates on plasticity\n\n1:57:48.120 --> 1:57:48.960\n in the forebrain,\n\n1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:53.720\n and they are gated by nicotinic acetylcholine transmission.\n\n1:57:53.720 --> 1:57:56.880\n And why that hasn't made it into protocols\n\n1:57:56.880 --> 1:57:59.520\n for motor learning, sport learning, language learning,\n\n1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:02.480\n music learning, emotional learning, I don't know.\n\n1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:05.520\n I think part of the reason has been kind of cultural\n\n1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:07.840\n is that scientists publish their paper and they move on.\n\n1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:11.000\n Merzenich talked a lot and still can be found\n\n1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.080\n from time to time talking about\n\n1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:16.560\n how these plasticity mechanisms can be leveraged.\n\n1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:18.860\n But he had a commercial company,\n\n1:58:18.860 --> 1:58:21.240\n and so then people kind of backed away from him a little bit.\n\n1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:22.720\n I think he was, to be honest,\n\n1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:25.240\n I think Merzenich was ahead of his time.\n\n1:58:25.240 --> 1:58:27.320\n And I think the timing is right now\n\n1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:30.360\n for people to understand these mechanisms of plasticity\n\n1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:31.600\n and start to implement them.\n\n1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:34.160\n Also, it all sounds like becoming superhuman\n\n1:58:34.160 --> 1:58:37.080\n or optimizing or whatever, all that, yes.\n\n1:58:37.080 --> 1:58:39.760\n But also what about kids with language learning deficits\n\n1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:44.000\n or with dyslexia or just performance in school in general?\n\n1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.200\n I have a deep, interesting concern\n\n1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:48.480\n for the future of science and mathematics\n\n1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:51.640\n and not just in this country, but all over the world.\n\n1:58:51.640 --> 1:58:56.200\n And more plasticity equals faster, better, deeper learning.\n\n1:58:56.200 --> 1:58:58.080\n And if we don't do this,\n\n1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:00.520\n I don't think we're going to get the full reach\n\n1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:03.000\n out of all the machine learning tools either,\n\n1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:06.000\n because everyone talks about these huge data sets,\n\n1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:09.480\n but those huge data sets funnel into human interpretation.\n\n1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:12.380\n I mean, we don't just like stare at the numbers and bask.\n\n1:59:12.380 --> 1:59:14.660\n So the human brain, I think,\n\n1:59:14.660 --> 1:59:17.600\n needs to leverage these plasticity mechanisms\n\n1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:20.240\n to keep up with the thing that's happening very, very fast,\n\n1:59:20.240 --> 1:59:21.820\n which is technology development.\n\n1:59:21.820 --> 1:59:24.080\n So that's a long winded way of saying\n\n1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:27.000\n basal forebrain, cholinergic transmission and plasticity,\n\n1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:29.080\n it allows for plasticity in adulthood\n\n1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:33.360\n and it allows for single trial learning, which is incredible.\n\n1:59:33.360 --> 1:59:34.920\n But how do we leverage that?\n\n1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:38.160\n Like in the physical space taking actions\n\n1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:41.160\n or is there some chemicals that can stimulate neuroplasticity?\n\n1:59:44.440 --> 1:59:45.280\n Like what?\n\n1:59:45.280 --> 1:59:46.720\n I think it's the intersection of the two.\n\n1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:48.880\n I think it's being engaged in a physical practice\n\n1:59:48.880 --> 1:59:51.000\n while enhancing pharmacology.\n\n1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:52.260\n And it has to be done safely.\n\n1:59:52.260 --> 1:59:54.120\n And this is full of open questions.\n\n1:59:54.120 --> 1:59:56.600\n This is the very beginnings of it, like you're saying.\n\n1:59:56.600 --> 1:59:58.960\n Yeah, a pill that's safe\n\n1:59:58.960 --> 2:00:00.720\n that increases nicotinic transmission.\n\n2:00:00.720 --> 2:00:03.000\n I mean, I know a number of people that chew Nicorette.\n\n2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:05.560\n Actually, I have a Nobel prize winning colleague\n\n2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:08.360\n at Columbia, not to be named,\n\n2:00:08.360 --> 2:00:10.000\n who chews like six pieces of Nicorette\n\n2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:11.880\n in a half hour conversation with him.\n\n2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:14.960\n And he started doing that as a replacement for smoking\n\n2:00:14.960 --> 2:00:18.180\n because smoking is nicotine nicotinic stimulation\n\n2:00:18.180 --> 2:00:19.880\n of the cholinergic system.\n\n2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:22.800\n So smokers have long known that increases focus\n\n2:00:22.800 --> 2:00:24.120\n and attention and learning.\n\n2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:27.120\n It's just that the lung cancer thing is a barrier.\n\n2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:29.040\n Now I'm not suggesting people take Nicorette,\n\n2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:32.760\n but it's clear that we need better directed pharmacology.\n\n2:00:32.760 --> 2:00:34.720\n But you can imagine next time you go in\n\n2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:37.440\n for a learning bout, if it's really essential,\n\n2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:39.780\n you might want to stimulate the nicotinic system\n\n2:00:39.780 --> 2:00:41.560\n if that's safe for you.\n\n2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:42.520\n Again, I'm a doctor.\n\n2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:44.160\n So again, I'm not telling people to do this,\n\n2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:45.800\n but that's where it's going.\n\n2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:47.480\n Until we start merging machines\n\n2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:52.300\n with pharmacology and behavior, we're just kind of walking\n\n2:00:52.300 --> 2:00:54.440\n around in the circle over and over again,\n\n2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:56.320\n and it's going to happen.\n\n2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:00.540\n Do you find computer vision, machine learning\n\n2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:04.740\n from the perspective of tooling as an interesting tool\n\n2:01:04.740 --> 2:01:08.840\n for analyzing, for processing all the data\n\n2:01:08.840 --> 2:01:11.960\n from the neuroscience world, from the neurobiology,\n\n2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:15.120\n biology, all the different data sets\n\n2:01:15.120 --> 2:01:17.160\n that you could have about the mind, the eye,\n\n2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:21.080\n the everything that's neck and above,\n\n2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:23.480\n and also the central nervous system and all?\n\n2:01:23.480 --> 2:01:24.720\n Absolutely.\n\n2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:27.640\n I think that computer science and engineering\n\n2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:32.040\n and chemistry, bioengineering, that's what's creating\n\n2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:35.660\n the acceleration and progress in neuroscience right now.\n\n2:01:35.660 --> 2:01:38.680\n I think it's actually one place where science,\n\n2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:43.280\n I'm very reassured, science has invited in psychologists,\n\n2:01:43.280 --> 2:01:46.080\n computational biologists, at least at Stanford, MIT,\n\n2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:48.800\n and other places too, of course, it's clear\n\n2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:53.120\n that it's a everyone's invited kind of party right now.\n\n2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:55.880\n That the major issue in the field of neuroscience,\n\n2:01:55.880 --> 2:01:57.160\n at least through my view,\n\n2:01:57.160 --> 2:01:59.180\n is that there's no conceptual leadership.\n\n2:01:59.180 --> 2:02:00.700\n No one is saying we need to work on\n\n2:02:00.700 --> 2:02:02.760\n and solve this problem or that problem.\n\n2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:05.720\n It's very fragmented right now.\n\n2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:07.840\n Now, the good news is people are communicating.\n\n2:02:07.840 --> 2:02:10.400\n So computer scientists and people who work on AI,\n\n2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:13.640\n machine vision are talking to biologists and vice versa,\n\n2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:15.640\n but it's very dispersed.\n\n2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:18.920\n Is there a lot of different data sets in your work\n\n2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:21.120\n that you've just come across?\n\n2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:23.760\n Is there a huge number of disparate data sets\n\n2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:26.320\n around neuroscience and so on?\n\n2:02:26.320 --> 2:02:28.120\n Well, there's a lot of cell sequencing stuff.\n\n2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:32.520\n So the Broad over in Boston and then on this coast,\n\n2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:34.280\n the Chen Zuckerberg Initiative,\n\n2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:40.840\n they did $3 billion to sequence every cell type\n\n2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:43.920\n in humans and in animals and I think their goal\n\n2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:47.080\n is to cure every disease by some date,\n\n2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:48.800\n I don't know, in the future.\n\n2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:54.560\n Huge data sets of gene expression and protein expression,\n\n2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:55.760\n that's valuable.\n\n2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:58.280\n I think no one really knows how to think\n\n2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:02.920\n about neural circuits and what is a neural circuit?\n\n2:03:02.920 --> 2:03:04.560\n Is it one structure?\n\n2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:06.580\n Is it two structures communicating?\n\n2:03:06.580 --> 2:03:08.840\n I think this is where I actually think\n\n2:03:08.840 --> 2:03:13.640\n that the robotics is going to tell us how the brain works\n\n2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:16.240\n because it's tempting to think that the brain\n\n2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:18.660\n has all these cell types and circuits\n\n2:03:18.660 --> 2:03:20.800\n in order to solve specific problems.\n\n2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:23.120\n But it might be that the fundamental algorithm\n\n2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:24.960\n is to create cells and circuits\n\n2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:27.080\n that can solve variable problems.\n\n2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:29.660\n We know in the retina, just a very simple example\n\n2:03:29.660 --> 2:03:31.640\n is that we've always heard about like cones\n\n2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:33.360\n are for color vision and high acuity\n\n2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:37.520\n and rods are for night vision and non color vision.\n\n2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:40.840\n But at the dusk, dawn transition,\n\n2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:43.160\n certain cell types switch to do completely different,\n\n2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:44.460\n have a completely different function\n\n2:03:44.460 --> 2:03:45.520\n for viewing starry night\n\n2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:47.960\n versus what they do during the daytime.\n\n2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:50.120\n So neurons multiplex.\n\n2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:53.860\n And I think building machines that can multiplex\n\n2:03:53.860 --> 2:03:57.060\n and can evolve themselves is going to help us\n\n2:03:57.060 --> 2:03:58.600\n really understand what the brain is doing.\n\n2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:01.520\n We need to tease out the fundamental algorithms.\n\n2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:03.260\n We know they're like motion detection\n\n2:04:03.260 --> 2:04:05.160\n and spatial vision and things like that.\n\n2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:07.420\n I think machines are going to be much faster at that\n\n2:04:07.420 --> 2:04:11.040\n than our understanding of biology\n\n2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:13.680\n and how the brain does that.\n\n2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:15.120\n Basically, I'll be out of a job\n\n2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:16.560\n and people like you will have a job.\n\n2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:19.620\n Well, no, I think the main idea is that\n\n2:04:19.620 --> 2:04:22.120\n there won't be a job that's machine learning\n\n2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:24.000\n or computer vision.\n\n2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:27.420\n It's just, it's a tool that neuroscientists\n\n2:04:27.420 --> 2:04:29.400\n will use more and more and more\n\n2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:31.920\n and biologists would use.\n\n2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:35.320\n I mean, this whole idea that it will just be a tool\n\n2:04:35.320 --> 2:04:39.240\n that allows you to start expanding\n\n2:04:39.240 --> 2:04:41.840\n the kind of things you can study.\n\n2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:43.520\n Well, the next generation coming up,\n\n2:04:43.520 --> 2:04:45.200\n I can say this because I now I'm blessed\n\n2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:46.880\n to have a bioengineering student.\n\n2:04:46.880 --> 2:04:50.920\n They think about problems so differently than biologists do.\n\n2:04:50.920 --> 2:04:52.440\n We realized the other day we both came up\n\n2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:54.440\n with a set of ideas around a certain project\n\n2:04:54.440 --> 2:04:56.360\n and we realized that her version of it\n\n2:04:56.360 --> 2:04:58.420\n was the exact opposite of mine.\n\n2:04:58.420 --> 2:05:00.280\n And hers was far more rational.\n\n2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:01.680\n It's just an engineering perspective.\n\n2:05:01.680 --> 2:05:03.600\n It's like, why would we do that last?\n\n2:05:03.600 --> 2:05:04.920\n We should do that first.\n\n2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:08.120\n I think that the next generation is really interested\n\n2:05:08.120 --> 2:05:09.840\n in solving practical problems.\n\n2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:12.120\n So a lot like computer science and engineering was\n\n2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:13.860\n in the late nineties, it was like,\n\n2:05:13.860 --> 2:05:16.360\n you can go do a PhD in computer science and engineering,\n\n2:05:16.360 --> 2:05:18.280\n maybe, or you go work for a company\n\n2:05:18.280 --> 2:05:20.220\n and actually build stuff that's useful.\n\n2:05:20.220 --> 2:05:21.960\n I think neuroscientists and people interested\n\n2:05:21.960 --> 2:05:23.820\n in neuroscience are starting to think,\n\n2:05:23.820 --> 2:05:25.640\n how can I build stuff that's useful?\n\n2:05:25.640 --> 2:05:27.920\n And this statement is supported by the fact\n\n2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:32.040\n that many people in my business leave their academic labs,\n\n2:05:32.040 --> 2:05:33.400\n fortunately not all of them,\n\n2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:34.560\n but they leave their academic labs\n\n2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:37.520\n and they go work for companies like Neuralink.\n\n2:05:37.520 --> 2:05:42.520\n This is something I think we've spoken a few times offline\n\n2:05:42.660 --> 2:05:47.320\n about, I mean, speaking of computer vision,\n\n2:05:47.320 --> 2:05:48.840\n I'm fascinated by the eye.\n\n2:05:48.840 --> 2:05:50.800\n I did a bunch of work on the eye.\n\n2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:52.920\n So there's the neuroscientists,\n\n2:05:52.920 --> 2:05:55.040\n there's a neurobiology way of studying the eye,\n\n2:05:55.040 --> 2:05:57.960\n and there's the computer vision way of studying the eye.\n\n2:05:57.960 --> 2:05:59.920\n And the computer vision way of studying the eye\n\n2:05:59.920 --> 2:06:03.080\n of just like observing, noncontext sensing of humans\n\n2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:04.360\n is really fascinating to me\n\n2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:06.760\n and studying human behavior in different contexts,\n\n2:06:06.760 --> 2:06:09.600\n like in semi autonomous vehicles,\n\n2:06:09.600 --> 2:06:11.760\n it seemed like there's a lot of signal\n\n2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:14.200\n that comes from the eye, that comes from blinking,\n\n2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:16.960\n that's not fully understood yet.\n\n2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:20.160\n It's been in the lab, it's been used quite a bit\n\n2:06:20.160 --> 2:06:22.640\n to study like the dilation of the pupil,\n\n2:06:22.640 --> 2:06:27.400\n all those kinds of things are used to infer workload,\n\n2:06:27.400 --> 2:06:29.760\n cognitive load, all those kinds of things.\n\n2:06:29.760 --> 2:06:32.600\n But the pictures is murky.\n\n2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:34.400\n It's not completely well understood,\n\n2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:36.840\n especially in the wild, how much signal you can get\n\n2:06:36.840 --> 2:06:38.640\n from the eye, from the human face.\n\n2:06:40.040 --> 2:06:43.960\n I've downloaded Joe Rogan's,\n\n2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:46.140\n all of the podcasts he's ever done, video.\n\n2:06:47.100 --> 2:06:49.000\n You have the YouTube bank.\n\n2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:51.920\n I have the YouTube bank for a reason\n\n2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:56.040\n that this was before he went with Spotify.\n\n2:06:57.200 --> 2:06:58.200\n You own the archive.\n\n2:06:58.200 --> 2:07:01.080\n There's PubMed, and then there's the Joe Rogan experience\n\n2:07:01.080 --> 2:07:04.760\n owned by, or maintained by Lex.\n\n2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:06.720\n For my private collection.\n\n2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:08.440\n No, the reason I did it,\n\n2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:11.280\n and I did a really rigorous processing of it,\n\n2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:15.780\n which is like I extracted all of the faces,\n\n2:07:15.780 --> 2:07:17.840\n I did the really good blink track,\n\n2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:21.080\n the pupil tracking and the blink detection\n\n2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:22.520\n for the entirety of the,\n\n2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:25.000\n oh, I should say it's from episode like,\n\n2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.240\n I forget what it is, but it's like episode 900\n\n2:07:28.240 --> 2:07:31.360\n when they switched to 1080p video.\n\n2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:33.480\n But it was like much crappier video.\n\n2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:34.320\n It's still kind of.\n\n2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:36.580\n Did you log when there was marijuana consumption\n\n2:07:36.580 --> 2:07:38.760\n or when they were drinking?\n\n2:07:38.760 --> 2:07:39.600\n I mean, there's so many.\n\n2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:41.520\n Because that's gonna, like just,\n\n2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:43.040\n it won't throw off the data,\n\n2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:46.000\n but it's relevant to the pupil data.\n\n2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:50.160\n So let's just put it this way.\n\n2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:51.480\n There's a lot of fascinating\n\n2:07:51.480 --> 2:07:53.160\n computer vision problems involved,\n\n2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:57.120\n but I only kept long sequences of data\n\n2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:00.380\n where the eyes detected exceptionally well.\n\n2:08:00.380 --> 2:08:04.160\n And I also removed people that were wearing glasses.\n\n2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:08.680\n I removed, there's certain people that have a way\n\n2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:13.680\n of moving their eyes and squinting\n\n2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:19.080\n where it's harder to infer like concrete blinks.\n\n2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:24.920\n They'll kind of have a squint the whole time.\n\n2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:27.560\n And their blink is very light.\n\n2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:32.500\n It's very tough to know what's an actual blink.\n\n2:08:32.500 --> 2:08:33.340\n So I wanted to.\n\n2:08:33.340 --> 2:08:35.480\n Then you got those baseball cap wearing guys.\n\n2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:37.000\n There are certain people that go on podcasts\n\n2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.840\n and wear baseball caps and don't reveal their,\n\n2:08:39.840 --> 2:08:42.360\n I don't know if they realize it or not until it comes out,\n\n2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:45.680\n but their face is completely obscured from vision.\n\n2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:47.820\n And from a computer vision perspective,\n\n2:08:47.820 --> 2:08:51.320\n people that wear makeup and usually women on their eyes,\n\n2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:52.680\n it complicates things.\n\n2:08:52.680 --> 2:08:54.800\n Like eyelashes all complicate things.\n\n2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:57.200\n So you can clean stuff up\n\n2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:59.380\n just so you have really crisp signal.\n\n2:08:59.380 --> 2:09:02.200\n You don't have to, you can deal with issues,\n\n2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:04.960\n but there's so many hours of Joe Rogan video.\n\n2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:08.360\n Anyway, I say all that because I was searching\n\n2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:11.600\n for an interesting personal experiment for me\n\n2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:15.520\n because I saw in drivers when I was looking\n\n2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:19.280\n at eye movement in drivers, it seemed to indicate,\n\n2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:21.640\n there seemed to be quite a lot of signal there\n\n2:09:21.640 --> 2:09:25.560\n that indicates amount of cognitive load,\n\n2:09:25.560 --> 2:09:28.840\n but it's not clear if there's something conclusive,\n\n2:09:28.840 --> 2:09:31.920\n but if there is some signal, that's a really powerful one\n\n2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:35.260\n because eye movement can be detected in the wild.\n\n2:09:35.260 --> 2:09:36.480\n Like you and I sitting here,\n\n2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:38.400\n I can detect eye movement really well.\n\n2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:41.400\n Pupil dilation is a really crappy indicator.\n\n2:09:41.400 --> 2:09:42.700\n And it's luminance dependent.\n\n2:09:42.700 --> 2:09:45.920\n Like if I turn toward a light, it's a route.\n\n2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:48.760\n People change size depending on level of alertness,\n\n2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:49.920\n arouse autonomic arousal,\n\n2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:51.920\n but also overall levels of luminance.\n\n2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:54.960\n It's very, very hard, but there are,\n\n2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:57.740\n I mean, you're sitting on a gold mine\n\n2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:00.920\n because there is a lot of interest right now\n\n2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:05.020\n in measuring state through noncontact sensing.\n\n2:10:05.020 --> 2:10:07.720\n Heart rate variability through changes in skin tone,\n\n2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:08.560\n just off a camera.\n\n2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:10.260\n Can you imagine that at the point where\n\n2:10:10.260 --> 2:10:11.560\n you just look at some video and you're like,\n\n2:10:11.560 --> 2:10:13.680\n oh, they're getting more stressed or worked up\n\n2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:15.200\n and they're not based on a heat map\n\n2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:16.740\n of some little patch on their face.\n\n2:10:16.740 --> 2:10:18.920\n Cause everyone's going to have this slight,\n\n2:10:18.920 --> 2:10:21.000\n sort of compartmentalize it slightly differently,\n\n2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:22.480\n but you can learn it pretty quickly.\n\n2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:24.040\n We know this when someone's like giving a talk\n\n2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:27.400\n and we see them starting to blotching on their neck.\n\n2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:31.240\n This is like the thesis defense response, right?\n\n2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:34.040\n We know it and it's a stressful situation\n\n2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:37.560\n because not passing your thesis defense is rough.\n\n2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:38.760\n And we can see that,\n\n2:10:38.760 --> 2:10:40.800\n but cameras can pick that up really easily\n\n2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:43.880\n at much lower levels than the blatant blotching\n\n2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:44.720\n kind of effect.\n\n2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:49.200\n And eye movements certainly are powerful indications\n\n2:10:49.200 --> 2:10:51.600\n of the state of the autonomic system.\n\n2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:55.600\n So do you think there are things from a high level\n\n2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:58.800\n that you can pick up from eye movement and blinking?\n\n2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:01.120\n Well, blink frequency is going to increase\n\n2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:04.280\n as people get tired, right?\n\n2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:06.320\n I've actually been teased a lot online\n\n2:11:06.320 --> 2:11:08.680\n cause I don't blink much when I'll do a post.\n\n2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:11.000\n And so I did a whole post about blinking,\n\n2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:11.920\n about the science of blinking.\n\n2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:14.880\n There's some data, very strong data, not from my lab\n\n2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:16.680\n that show that every time you blink,\n\n2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:18.400\n it resets your perception of time.\n\n2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:20.280\n They have people do these kind of track\n\n2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:22.480\n a kind of a Doppler like thing.\n\n2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:25.320\n And anyway, blinking resets your perception of time.\n\n2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:26.880\n There's a dopaminergic mechanism\n\n2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:29.580\n in the blink related circuitry of the brain.\n\n2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:31.400\n When people are very alert,\n\n2:11:31.400 --> 2:11:32.520\n they tend to not blink very much.\n\n2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:33.920\n When we're sleepy, we tend to blink more\n\n2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:35.320\n and our eyes tend to close.\n\n2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:37.040\n Now, some people are more hooded\n\n2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:38.440\n in the way their eyes sit.\n\n2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:40.640\n Some people are like this all the time.\n\n2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:41.720\n There are some very famous people.\n\n2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:42.560\n I'm not gonna name them\n\n2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:44.840\n because I might run into them at some point\n\n2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:47.040\n who were like accused of being sociopaths\n\n2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:48.740\n cause they don't blink very often.\n\n2:11:48.740 --> 2:11:51.040\n But they might just have high levels of autonomic arousal.\n\n2:11:51.040 --> 2:11:53.340\n They just don't blink very much.\n\n2:11:53.340 --> 2:11:54.980\n Also depends on how lubricated the eyes are.\n\n2:11:54.980 --> 2:11:57.480\n So I think within individual,\n\n2:11:57.480 --> 2:11:59.120\n you can get a lot of information.\n\n2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:01.740\n I don't think we can say this person's blinking a lot.\n\n2:12:01.740 --> 2:12:03.720\n They're lying, this person or they're tired.\n\n2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:07.120\n This person doesn't blink, they're stressed.\n\n2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:10.360\n I think if you understand that person's baseline,\n\n2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:11.180\n you can get it.\n\n2:12:11.180 --> 2:12:13.200\n And presumably, well, having been\n\n2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:14.360\n on the Joe Rogan Experience,\n\n2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:15.640\n I can say when you first sit down there,\n\n2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:17.040\n if you've never been in there before.\n\n2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:18.960\n You're in my data set by the way.\n\n2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:19.800\n Oh my.\n\n2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:22.420\n Well, I bet you I will admit to being,\n\n2:12:22.420 --> 2:12:24.000\n first time sitting down there.\n\n2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:25.720\n I mean, Joe was incredibly gracious,\n\n2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:27.100\n made me feel very comfortable there.\n\n2:12:27.100 --> 2:12:30.120\n But yeah, it's an intense experience.\n\n2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:31.280\n It's a small space too.\n\n2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:33.880\n Anytime you enter a small space from a big space\n\n2:12:33.880 --> 2:12:38.060\n in his old studio, you're familiar with,\n\n2:12:38.060 --> 2:12:39.200\n there's a breaking in period\n\n2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:40.820\n where you're getting to know somebody.\n\n2:12:40.820 --> 2:12:43.560\n And so I'm sure my levels of autonomic arousal\n\n2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:46.160\n front of the podcast were higher than later.\n\n2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:48.360\n But once you have a baseline established,\n\n2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:52.800\n you can get a lot of data on somebody simply from blinks.\n\n2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:54.780\n Some people averting gaze too.\n\n2:12:54.780 --> 2:12:56.840\n If you have both people, that's really powerful.\n\n2:12:56.840 --> 2:13:00.060\n This is the holy grail, another holy grail of neuroscience.\n\n2:13:00.060 --> 2:13:03.000\n We've mainly looked at subjects in isolation.\n\n2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:04.800\n There hasn't been much brain imaging\n\n2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:06.720\n of two people interacting\n\n2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:09.120\n or even in animal models of two mice\n\n2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:10.400\n or two monkeys interacting.\n\n2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:13.520\n It's all like person scanner, bite bar.\n\n2:13:13.520 --> 2:13:14.800\n I mean, if you've ever been in one of these scanners,\n\n2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:16.240\n you're like in a bite bar.\n\n2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:17.640\n It's very medieval.\n\n2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:19.640\n And so you think in the interaction,\n\n2:13:19.640 --> 2:13:22.180\n there's actually, you can almost study them\n\n2:13:22.180 --> 2:13:24.400\n as a single brain or as a single system.\n\n2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:26.320\n The two brains are a single system.\n\n2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:27.160\n I think with AI.\n\n2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:28.000\n Highly correlated.\n\n2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.720\n Yeah, maybe are your blinks triggering my blinks?\n\n2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:35.240\n Are your non blink epochs extending my non blink epochs?\n\n2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:38.100\n There's a fascinating space to explore there\n\n2:13:38.100 --> 2:13:39.200\n and no one's done it.\n\n2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:43.760\n And because everyone let the Joe Rogan experience archive\n\n2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:45.280\n disappear, except for you.\n\n2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:47.160\n You grabbed, did you get the comments too?\n\n2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:49.680\n Because I think the comments were almost as entertaining\n\n2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:50.680\n as the conversation.\n\n2:13:50.680 --> 2:13:53.080\n You know what you just made me realize with the couplings,\n\n2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:55.560\n I have a better data set than the Joe Rogan podcast\n\n2:13:55.560 --> 2:13:56.960\n with high resolution video,\n\n2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:59.580\n which is the raw video for this podcast.\n\n2:13:59.580 --> 2:14:02.540\n So for example, both cameras right now are recording\n\n2:14:02.540 --> 2:14:05.440\n you and I full feed.\n\n2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:07.720\n The final result will switch cameras back and forth,\n\n2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:09.640\n but I have the full feed.\n\n2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:11.900\n So I can have the blinking for both you and I\n\n2:14:11.900 --> 2:14:12.740\n the whole time.\n\n2:14:12.740 --> 2:14:16.360\n I bet you people trigger blinks and in one another,\n\n2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:19.300\n you know, and there's also like the simplest way\n\n2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:21.560\n to think about the blinks and the attentional thing\n\n2:14:21.560 --> 2:14:25.520\n and the alertness is two fighters in the standoff.\n\n2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:28.200\n There's this whole lore around who blinks first.\n\n2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:29.120\n It's like they blink first.\n\n2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:30.800\n Well, what are we really asking?\n\n2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:35.120\n They're asking whether or not one person can maintain focus\n\n2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:36.720\n longer than the other person,\n\n2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:39.440\n which is an important parameter.\n\n2:14:39.440 --> 2:14:40.600\n It's not the only parameter,\n\n2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:42.680\n but it's an important parameter.\n\n2:14:42.680 --> 2:14:44.100\n And so that blinking contest,\n\n2:14:44.100 --> 2:14:46.700\n even though they don't square off as a blinking contest,\n\n2:14:46.700 --> 2:14:48.960\n it's well known that the first to blink\n\n2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:51.280\n is revealing something about their capacity\n\n2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:52.580\n to hold attention.\n\n2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:56.120\n You've started an amazing podcast\n\n2:14:56.120 --> 2:14:57.980\n that we've mentioned a few times.\n\n2:14:57.980 --> 2:14:59.840\n People should definitely check it out.\n\n2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:02.540\n It's called the Huberman Lab Podcast.\n\n2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:07.060\n It does your, it's basically,\n\n2:15:07.060 --> 2:15:10.960\n it embodies the personality of Andrew Huberman,\n\n2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:14.320\n which is like make science accessible,\n\n2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:20.760\n but also fascinating and giving it,\n\n2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:23.520\n like what do you call it?\n\n2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:25.760\n You give tools for everyday life,\n\n2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:28.940\n meaning it kind of grounds it like,\n\n2:15:28.940 --> 2:15:32.160\n what the hell does this mean for my life?\n\n2:15:32.160 --> 2:15:35.360\n But then also does the beauty of science at the same time.\n\n2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:39.880\n So I love both the rigor and the openness\n\n2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:40.720\n of the whole thing,\n\n2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:42.840\n plus the whole corrections things that we mentioned.\n\n2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:47.520\n Anyway, what's been the hardest part of this whole process?\n\n2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:52.420\n You're one of, already one of the only,\n\n2:15:52.420 --> 2:15:56.540\n and one of the best science broadcasters out there.\n\n2:15:56.540 --> 2:15:59.800\n So in that process, what's been the hardest,\n\n2:15:59.800 --> 2:16:01.480\n what's been the most exciting part?\n\n2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:02.960\n Wow, well, first of all,\n\n2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:05.520\n thanks for the kind words about the podcast.\n\n2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:07.080\n It was inspired by you.\n\n2:16:07.080 --> 2:16:11.540\n I absolutely, that's no BS.\n\n2:16:11.540 --> 2:16:14.760\n The last time we met to do an interview for your podcast,\n\n2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:15.800\n we talked a little bit about it\n\n2:16:15.800 --> 2:16:19.360\n and you gave me the subtle nudge\n\n2:16:19.360 --> 2:16:21.720\n that maybe there was a podcast there\n\n2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:23.000\n and I thought about it and I laughed\n\n2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:24.760\n and I was just like, I gotta do this thing.\n\n2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:26.840\n And you really gave me the encouragement to do it.\n\n2:16:26.840 --> 2:16:30.260\n And your podcast, this podcast has really forged the way.\n\n2:16:30.260 --> 2:16:34.840\n You've been tip of the spear on serious scientific,\n\n2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:37.600\n intellectual, yet fun, accessible conversation.\n\n2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:42.600\n And so I, as your colleague and friend,\n\n2:16:42.680 --> 2:16:45.480\n but just even if those things weren't true,\n\n2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:48.560\n like this podcast was and is the inspiration.\n\n2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:49.400\n There's no question.\n\n2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:50.220\n Thank you so much.\n\n2:16:50.220 --> 2:16:52.040\n Yeah, I really, like 100%.\n\n2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:55.000\n And when I decided to do the podcast,\n\n2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:56.400\n the Huberman Lab Podcast,\n\n2:16:56.400 --> 2:16:58.940\n I thought really long and hard about what would work best\n\n2:16:58.940 --> 2:17:00.320\n and would be most beneficial.\n\n2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:02.120\n It turned out to be the hardest thing,\n\n2:17:02.120 --> 2:17:04.440\n which is to stay on a single topic\n\n2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:06.600\n for three or four or more episodes\n\n2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:08.680\n before switching to a new topic.\n\n2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:12.920\n Because I know from the experience of university\n\n2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:16.440\n and teaching in university, as you know as well,\n\n2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:19.400\n that there's always the temptation\n\n2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:20.760\n to pivot to something else,\n\n2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:23.540\n but the drilling into something really deeply\n\n2:17:23.540 --> 2:17:25.860\n is where the gems reside.\n\n2:17:25.860 --> 2:17:29.580\n And the challenge has been how to make it interesting,\n\n2:17:29.580 --> 2:17:31.280\n how to keep people on board,\n\n2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:33.540\n how to give people tools along the way,\n\n2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:37.680\n but also stay close to the scientific data.\n\n2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:39.720\n I like to think that we're headed in the right direction.\n\n2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:43.960\n It still needs to evolve, but that's been a challenge.\n\n2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:47.780\n I think I also am challenged by the fact\n\n2:17:47.780 --> 2:17:50.800\n that there's a tremendous range of backgrounds of listeners.\n\n2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:53.520\n So some people have asked for more names,\n\n2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:55.720\n like more bits and parts of the nervous system\n\n2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:57.600\n and cellular molecular mechanisms\n\n2:17:57.600 --> 2:17:58.480\n and all that kind of thing.\n\n2:17:58.480 --> 2:17:59.380\n And other people have said,\n\n2:17:59.380 --> 2:18:00.960\n I don't understand any of that stuff,\n\n2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:02.240\n but I think I'm keeping up.\n\n2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:04.120\n And so unlike a university course\n\n2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:05.300\n where there are prerequisites\n\n2:18:05.300 --> 2:18:06.680\n and everyone's coming to the table\n\n2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:08.400\n with more or less the same knowledge,\n\n2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:10.920\n I have a very limited sense of what the audience knows\n\n2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:11.960\n and doesn't know.\n\n2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:13.580\n So that's why I incorporated the feature\n\n2:18:13.580 --> 2:18:15.840\n of the comment section on YouTube,\n\n2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:18.120\n being a source of feedback.\n\n2:18:18.120 --> 2:18:21.920\n And I do kind of an office hours like episode\n\n2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:23.220\n every third or fourth episode\n\n2:18:23.220 --> 2:18:25.520\n where I address common questions.\n\n2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:29.140\n And I think that the podcast space in my mind,\n\n2:18:29.140 --> 2:18:31.600\n at least for the sort of podcasts I'm doing,\n\n2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:34.520\n needed a venue for the listeners\n\n2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:37.280\n to be a more integral part of the experience\n\n2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:38.860\n as opposed to just commenting\n\n2:18:38.860 --> 2:18:40.540\n on what they liked or didn't like.\n\n2:18:40.540 --> 2:18:42.680\n So while I like to hear what people liked and didn't like,\n\n2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:44.160\n I also really like to hear about,\n\n2:18:44.160 --> 2:18:46.960\n hey, tell me more about temperature minimums\n\n2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:48.240\n and how they can be used to phase shifts\n\n2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:50.240\n or cadient rhythms or whatever it is.\n\n2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:51.960\n And I realized that I'm probably losing\n\n2:18:51.960 --> 2:18:52.920\n some people along the way,\n\n2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:56.280\n but hopefully at the end of each month,\n\n2:18:56.280 --> 2:18:59.040\n and because of the way that the episodes are archived,\n\n2:18:59.040 --> 2:19:01.920\n people will come away feeling as if they've learned a ton\n\n2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:03.760\n and they have tools that they can implement.\n\n2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:04.960\n And perhaps most importantly,\n\n2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:07.640\n that they're starting to think scientifically\n\n2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:10.760\n about the tons of other stuff that's out there.\n\n2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:13.600\n So that's been the challenge and it's still really early\n\n2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:16.800\n days, but, and of course,\n\n2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:18.200\n there's also an intentional challenge.\n\n2:19:18.200 --> 2:19:19.440\n I realize that people are busy.\n\n2:19:19.440 --> 2:19:22.200\n Not everyone has two hours to listen to a podcast\n\n2:19:22.200 --> 2:19:25.560\n about jet lag and shift work and raising kids\n\n2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:27.120\n and sleep and that kind of thing.\n\n2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:27.960\n I'm not raising kids,\n\n2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:30.360\n but I did a whole thing about babies and sleep with,\n\n2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:32.480\n you know, and how parents can manage their sleep\n\n2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:33.900\n when kids aren't sleeping.\n\n2:19:33.900 --> 2:19:37.640\n So it's been, I'm hacking through the jungle\n\n2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:41.440\n of all this stuff, but, and I'll come right back to it.\n\n2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:46.440\n My inspiration and my North star on this is getting\n\n2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:51.440\n to a point where the audience that listens to this feels\n\n2:19:53.860 --> 2:19:56.420\n the same way that I do when I listen to your podcast.\n\n2:19:56.420 --> 2:19:57.260\n Thank you so much.\n\n2:19:57.260 --> 2:19:58.940\n Like when I turn into your podcast,\n\n2:19:58.940 --> 2:20:00.080\n I'm going to embarrass you a little bit more\n\n2:20:00.080 --> 2:20:01.980\n by complimenting you a little bit more,\n\n2:20:02.980 --> 2:20:05.620\n but not out of a sadistic thing,\n\n2:20:05.620 --> 2:20:08.160\n but just because when I tune into your podcast\n\n2:20:08.160 --> 2:20:11.140\n or Joe's podcast, I have the same sensation\n\n2:20:11.140 --> 2:20:11.980\n that other people have.\n\n2:20:11.980 --> 2:20:15.500\n Like, I feel like I'm home of sorts.\n\n2:20:15.500 --> 2:20:17.300\n I'm like, I'm familiar with the space\n\n2:20:17.300 --> 2:20:20.420\n and I'd like people to feel comfortable in the space\n\n2:20:20.420 --> 2:20:21.620\n that is the Huber and Lab Podcast,\n\n2:20:21.620 --> 2:20:23.300\n whatever that ends up being.\n\n2:20:23.300 --> 2:20:25.820\n Yeah, that's the magic of podcasting.\n\n2:20:25.820 --> 2:20:28.060\n It's like, I feel like I'm part of your life now\n\n2:20:28.060 --> 2:20:32.280\n in a way that, as a fan, that I wouldn't be otherwise.\n\n2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:35.660\n And, you know, like I never was able to have that\n\n2:20:35.660 --> 2:20:37.860\n with Carl Sagan, for example, you know?\n\n2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:42.180\n And that's a whole nother level of connection\n\n2:20:42.180 --> 2:20:44.300\n with a human being that gets you excited.\n\n2:20:44.300 --> 2:20:46.260\n And then I share your excitement\n\n2:20:46.260 --> 2:20:49.900\n about different topics in neuroscience\n\n2:20:49.900 --> 2:20:54.740\n or just biology in general.\n\n2:20:54.740 --> 2:20:56.860\n And then I don't have to actually understand\n\n2:20:56.860 --> 2:21:00.860\n everything you're saying to really enjoy it.\n\n2:21:00.860 --> 2:21:03.700\n So that's the magic of podcasting is like,\n\n2:21:03.700 --> 2:21:05.620\n you can go through like 10 minutes\n\n2:21:05.620 --> 2:21:08.320\n and not understanding what the hell a person is saying,\n\n2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:11.540\n and then you enjoy the excitement\n\n2:21:11.540 --> 2:21:12.980\n and then you reconnect to a thing\n\n2:21:12.980 --> 2:21:15.340\n that you do understand what they're saying.\n\n2:21:15.340 --> 2:21:19.920\n And, you know, that's, that personal coupled\n\n2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:22.580\n with the scientific rigor is magic.\n\n2:21:22.580 --> 2:21:24.940\n And finding the right, it's exploration.\n\n2:21:24.940 --> 2:21:27.700\n Like Joe found something that works for comedians,\n\n2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:30.980\n which is like, you know, having a good laugh,\n\n2:21:30.980 --> 2:21:34.060\n but also every once in a while talking seriously\n\n2:21:34.060 --> 2:21:35.440\n about difficult topics.\n\n2:21:36.380 --> 2:21:40.280\n The scientific space, it was unclear.\n\n2:21:40.280 --> 2:21:41.700\n You haven't had guests on.\n\n2:21:41.700 --> 2:21:45.060\n Not yet, but maybe you'll come on as our first guest.\n\n2:21:45.060 --> 2:21:46.060\n I was gonna invite my,\n\n2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:48.180\n I was gonna try to force myself in there.\n\n2:21:48.180 --> 2:21:50.220\n I am, I'm officially inviting you now.\n\n2:21:50.220 --> 2:21:51.140\n Will you come on the podcast?\n\n2:21:51.140 --> 2:21:53.260\n I would love to, I would love to.\n\n2:21:53.260 --> 2:21:55.660\n But it was hard.\n\n2:21:55.660 --> 2:21:58.660\n It's still a little bit difficult to tell people\n\n2:21:59.580 --> 2:22:01.060\n that no, you don't get it.\n\n2:22:01.060 --> 2:22:03.900\n We're not gonna talk for 10 minutes.\n\n2:22:03.900 --> 2:22:07.300\n We're gonna talk for three or four hours.\n\n2:22:07.300 --> 2:22:09.020\n It's a different, for scientists,\n\n2:22:09.020 --> 2:22:12.340\n for like, they're like, what are we gonna talk about?\n\n2:22:12.340 --> 2:22:14.180\n They think it's like the NPR interview.\n\n2:22:14.180 --> 2:22:15.020\n Yes.\n\n2:22:15.020 --> 2:22:18.460\n And they don't realize, first of all,\n\n2:22:18.460 --> 2:22:20.820\n I think at his best, if you're like at the level\n\n2:22:20.820 --> 2:22:24.180\n of Joe Rogan, who I think is an excellent conversationalist,\n\n2:22:26.060 --> 2:22:27.500\n you just lose track of time.\n\n2:22:27.500 --> 2:22:29.140\n It can be three, four, five hours\n\n2:22:29.140 --> 2:22:30.340\n and you lose track of time.\n\n2:22:30.340 --> 2:22:31.860\n I'm still not there.\n\n2:22:31.860 --> 2:22:34.100\n I find that it's still painful.\n\n2:22:34.100 --> 2:22:36.940\n Like the conversation is still challenging sometimes.\n\n2:22:36.940 --> 2:22:39.300\n You don't lose quite as much of track of time.\n\n2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:40.740\n It's still an intellectual effort.\n\n2:22:40.740 --> 2:22:43.380\n And I think it might always be as it would be with you\n\n2:22:43.380 --> 2:22:45.780\n because you're talking about difficult topics,\n\n2:22:45.780 --> 2:22:47.300\n maybe that require more brain.\n\n2:22:47.300 --> 2:22:51.180\n You're not just shooting the shit with like a Brian Red Band\n\n2:22:51.180 --> 2:22:53.500\n or somebody like comedians or just joking.\n\n2:22:53.500 --> 2:22:55.300\n What's like, remember those shows,\n\n2:22:56.300 --> 2:22:59.260\n like where those shows where someone would come out\n\n2:22:59.260 --> 2:23:02.380\n and like spin plates and they're running back and forth.\n\n2:23:02.380 --> 2:23:05.700\n Really good scientific discussion is like that.\n\n2:23:05.700 --> 2:23:07.980\n You have to be maintaining three or four\n\n2:23:07.980 --> 2:23:10.740\n different logical arguments and jumping back and forth.\n\n2:23:10.740 --> 2:23:13.900\n It's occasionally get into like a real streak of linearity.\n\n2:23:13.900 --> 2:23:17.260\n But as we found today that typically there's three\n\n2:23:17.260 --> 2:23:18.620\n or four different things that we're bouncing back\n\n2:23:18.620 --> 2:23:19.460\n and forth from.\n\n2:23:19.460 --> 2:23:21.820\n And that requires a lot of updating of these,\n\n2:23:21.820 --> 2:23:23.020\n you know, forebrain circuits.\n\n2:23:23.020 --> 2:23:25.900\n It's not a passive listening experience.\n\n2:23:25.900 --> 2:23:28.820\n But I like to think that the brain likes that.\n\n2:23:28.820 --> 2:23:31.980\n I do want to ask just cause we all,\n\n2:23:31.980 --> 2:23:36.180\n I don't want to forget the question came up to me\n\n2:23:36.180 --> 2:23:40.460\n is your podcast has the same kind of rigor\n\n2:23:40.460 --> 2:23:43.300\n that I think like a Dan Carlin podcast has\n\n2:23:43.300 --> 2:23:45.060\n who's a history podcaster.\n\n2:23:46.140 --> 2:23:47.900\n Well, that's a definitely a compliment.\n\n2:23:47.900 --> 2:23:48.740\n Thank you.\n\n2:23:48.740 --> 2:23:52.220\n Dan's way, you know, he's something for me to aspire to.\n\n2:23:52.220 --> 2:23:54.420\n He goes through hell to prepare.\n\n2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:56.260\n He spends months preparing.\n\n2:23:56.260 --> 2:24:01.100\n It feels like you've had to really prepare for your podcast.\n\n2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:02.940\n I definitely prepare hard.\n\n2:24:02.940 --> 2:24:04.540\n How does that?\n\n2:24:04.540 --> 2:24:05.460\n Are you okay?\n\n2:24:06.580 --> 2:24:07.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:07.420 --> 2:24:09.500\n I mean, how much effort does that take?\n\n2:24:09.500 --> 2:24:11.540\n It feels like a conference presentation.\n\n2:24:11.540 --> 2:24:12.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:12.380 --> 2:24:15.300\n So we record once a week and in the intervening time,\n\n2:24:15.300 --> 2:24:20.300\n I listened to many university level lectures.\n\n2:24:21.380 --> 2:24:25.140\n So NIH has a bank of lectures.\n\n2:24:25.140 --> 2:24:28.980\n I have some sources of recorded university seminars.\n\n2:24:28.980 --> 2:24:32.020\n I'm trying to find the points of intersection.\n\n2:24:32.020 --> 2:24:33.700\n So like for four episodes on sleep,\n\n2:24:33.700 --> 2:24:36.580\n it's not like I'm going to just regurgitate a popular book\n\n2:24:36.580 --> 2:24:39.380\n or take one lecture and just poach the content.\n\n2:24:39.380 --> 2:24:43.500\n I'm going to find the overlap in the different elements.\n\n2:24:43.500 --> 2:24:47.460\n I also, so what I'll do is I'll generally read 10\n\n2:24:47.460 --> 2:24:51.060\n or 15 papers and generally those are good reviews,\n\n2:24:51.060 --> 2:24:53.140\n annual reviews, any review of neuroscience,\n\n2:24:53.140 --> 2:24:55.540\n annual review of physiology, those kinds of things.\n\n2:24:55.540 --> 2:24:56.820\n I'll chase a few references.\n\n2:24:56.820 --> 2:24:58.300\n I'll listen to some YouTube videos,\n\n2:24:58.300 --> 2:25:00.460\n but of university level lectures.\n\n2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:03.380\n And then I throw all that on a whiteboard.\n\n2:25:03.380 --> 2:25:05.780\n Usually while I work out in the morning,\n\n2:25:05.780 --> 2:25:06.860\n I'll just be working out.\n\n2:25:06.860 --> 2:25:07.900\n I have a gym in my house\n\n2:25:07.900 --> 2:25:10.260\n and I'll just put up all these random ideas.\n\n2:25:10.260 --> 2:25:12.180\n I want to cover that dreams, hallucination.\n\n2:25:12.180 --> 2:25:14.660\n And then I take that and I start to eliminate,\n\n2:25:14.660 --> 2:25:17.180\n I draw lines between the common points of intersection.\n\n2:25:17.180 --> 2:25:21.380\n And then from that, I distill out an outline.\n\n2:25:21.380 --> 2:25:25.020\n And then I basically think about what I want to say\n\n2:25:25.020 --> 2:25:27.220\n on my walks with my dog.\n\n2:25:27.220 --> 2:25:29.260\n And I bother a couple of people and blab to them.\n\n2:25:29.260 --> 2:25:31.140\n So I would say each podcast, yeah,\n\n2:25:31.140 --> 2:25:33.180\n I put in 10 to 15 hours at least\n\n2:25:33.180 --> 2:25:35.620\n of passive listening preparation\n\n2:25:35.620 --> 2:25:38.700\n and maybe five or six of active preparation.\n\n2:25:38.700 --> 2:25:40.900\n So I do prepare quite a lot,\n\n2:25:40.900 --> 2:25:44.460\n but it has a certain reward component for me.\n\n2:25:44.460 --> 2:25:46.100\n To come up at the end with something\n\n2:25:46.100 --> 2:25:50.180\n that's somewhat crystallized for me is just so satisfying.\n\n2:25:50.180 --> 2:25:52.860\n It feel like there's something about my dopamine circuits\n\n2:25:52.860 --> 2:25:54.500\n that just love that.\n\n2:25:54.500 --> 2:25:58.020\n And the only pain is that a year later\n\n2:25:58.020 --> 2:26:00.140\n after I've talked about the stuff a bunch of times,\n\n2:26:00.140 --> 2:26:04.220\n it's so much more succinct, but that's life.\n\n2:26:04.220 --> 2:26:05.740\n At some point you got to pull the trigger.\n\n2:26:05.740 --> 2:26:08.380\n Well, I don't know what you think,\n\n2:26:08.380 --> 2:26:11.260\n but for me, YouTube is,\n\n2:26:11.260 --> 2:26:13.380\n that's why I'm sad that Joe left YouTube.\n\n2:26:13.380 --> 2:26:16.940\n There's a archival nature to YouTube that's kind of magical.\n\n2:26:16.940 --> 2:26:18.660\n And so I'm really glad you're now,\n\n2:26:18.660 --> 2:26:23.660\n you're doing a lot of educational content on Instagram\n\n2:26:23.660 --> 2:26:25.380\n and Instagram before,\n\n2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:29.140\n but now I'm doing this podcasting on YouTube.\n\n2:26:29.140 --> 2:26:32.420\n It's like, you know, it's like Feynman lectures.\n\n2:26:32.420 --> 2:26:35.860\n Like, I'm not saying every podcast,\n\n2:26:35.860 --> 2:26:38.500\n but there will be, you will have some,\n\n2:26:38.500 --> 2:26:42.340\n I could already tell there'll be some lectures\n\n2:26:42.340 --> 2:26:47.340\n which are like definitive, like really special ones.\n\n2:26:47.340 --> 2:26:48.180\n That's the hope.\n\n2:26:48.180 --> 2:26:51.740\n And there's some aspect that's archival to YouTube\n\n2:26:51.740 --> 2:26:54.860\n where at least I hope like 20 years from now,\n\n2:26:54.860 --> 2:26:58.260\n some kid is gonna watch a lecture of yours\n\n2:26:58.260 --> 2:27:02.860\n and it'll create the next Nobel prize, right?\n\n2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:07.860\n It'll create another dream that then becomes a reality.\n\n2:27:08.300 --> 2:27:12.580\n And then that's a special thing that YouTube provides.\n\n2:27:12.580 --> 2:27:14.060\n So I'm really excited that you're on YouTube.\n\n2:27:14.060 --> 2:27:15.540\n And at the same time,\n\n2:27:15.540 --> 2:27:17.420\n I'm excited to see where this thing goes\n\n2:27:17.420 --> 2:27:22.420\n because it seems like change is the cliche thing,\n\n2:27:22.980 --> 2:27:25.300\n that change is the only constant in these times\n\n2:27:25.300 --> 2:27:29.900\n because you're paving with this podcast,\n\n2:27:29.900 --> 2:27:32.380\n with this creativity, what you were doing on Instagram\n\n2:27:32.380 --> 2:27:34.900\n as well, you're paving the new era\n\n2:27:34.900 --> 2:27:37.180\n of what it means to do science.\n\n2:27:37.180 --> 2:27:39.460\n So actively doing research\n\n2:27:39.460 --> 2:27:42.540\n and actively explaining that research in new media.\n\n2:27:42.540 --> 2:27:44.740\n It's very interesting to see.\n\n2:27:44.740 --> 2:27:47.500\n I'm genuinely inspired by you.\n\n2:27:47.500 --> 2:27:49.140\n We had this discussion last time\n\n2:27:49.140 --> 2:27:51.540\n after the podcast recording,\n\n2:27:51.540 --> 2:27:54.620\n and it's clear that communication of science\n\n2:27:54.620 --> 2:27:58.740\n cannot be left to the existing institutions.\n\n2:27:58.740 --> 2:27:59.860\n And I'm not talking about universities.\n\n2:27:59.860 --> 2:28:02.740\n I just mean that the science section of newspapers is,\n\n2:28:03.740 --> 2:28:05.180\n sometimes there's some gems there,\n\n2:28:05.180 --> 2:28:08.100\n but generally it goes, you know?\n\n2:28:08.100 --> 2:28:11.420\n And I think you really have to know a field\n\n2:28:11.420 --> 2:28:13.700\n in order to extract the best things from that field.\n\n2:28:13.700 --> 2:28:16.740\n And my hope is that other practicing scientists\n\n2:28:16.740 --> 2:28:19.060\n and people finishing their PhD and postdoc\n\n2:28:19.060 --> 2:28:21.180\n and people who are running labs or working at companies\n\n2:28:21.180 --> 2:28:22.220\n will start to do this.\n\n2:28:22.220 --> 2:28:24.140\n I mean, how amazing would it be, for instance,\n\n2:28:24.140 --> 2:28:29.140\n if someone at Neuralink was giving us hints\n\n2:28:29.980 --> 2:28:31.980\n about not necessarily what they're developing\n\n2:28:31.980 --> 2:28:34.340\n because that's complicated for all sorts of reasons,\n\n2:28:34.340 --> 2:28:39.340\n but would talk to us about what the real challenges\n\n2:28:39.900 --> 2:28:43.660\n of building futuristic brain machine interface are like\n\n2:28:43.660 --> 2:28:47.020\n and what it means to understand a clinical problem\n\n2:28:47.020 --> 2:28:47.860\n and address it.\n\n2:28:47.860 --> 2:28:50.700\n I mean, my hope is somebody there might eventually do that,\n\n2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:53.700\n that somebody in the world of chemistry\n\n2:28:53.700 --> 2:28:55.940\n or synthetic materials or whatever it is\n\n2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:57.780\n will do this in a way that I could understand\n\n2:28:57.780 --> 2:28:59.900\n because I don't have expertise in those.\n\n2:28:59.900 --> 2:29:02.260\n I think it would be marvelous.\n\n2:29:02.260 --> 2:29:05.120\n And you were tip of the spear, you were out first,\n\n2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:09.820\n and I'm just happily trying to move along\n\n2:29:09.820 --> 2:29:10.760\n in the direction I'm going.\n\n2:29:10.760 --> 2:29:14.120\n But I think the future of science education is online.\n\n2:29:15.540 --> 2:29:17.380\n And I think that's gonna be scary\n\n2:29:17.380 --> 2:29:19.380\n to a lot of existing institutions,\n\n2:29:19.380 --> 2:29:21.540\n but it's not about disrupting anything.\n\n2:29:21.540 --> 2:29:23.340\n It's just about trying to do things better.\n\n2:29:23.340 --> 2:29:27.860\n Yeah, some of the best interviews,\n\n2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:30.860\n some of the best investigative journalism\n\n2:29:30.860 --> 2:29:33.620\n is done by people inside the field.\n\n2:29:33.620 --> 2:29:36.080\n Comes to mind a guy by the name of Elon Musk,\n\n2:29:36.080 --> 2:29:40.740\n who I love the possibility that he gets a Pulitzer\n\n2:29:40.740 --> 2:29:41.900\n for that interview.\n\n2:29:41.900 --> 2:29:44.100\n But he grilled the crap out of Vlad,\n\n2:29:44.100 --> 2:29:46.380\n the CEO of Robinhood.\n\n2:29:46.380 --> 2:29:47.220\n I'm not sure if you're familiar.\n\n2:29:47.220 --> 2:29:50.340\n Oh, on Clubhouse the other night.\n\n2:29:50.340 --> 2:29:51.860\n Yeah, I saw you guys in there.\n\n2:29:51.860 --> 2:29:53.780\n I was kept out, I wasn't quick enough.\n\n2:29:53.780 --> 2:29:55.300\n My thumbs don't go fast enough.\n\n2:29:55.300 --> 2:29:57.500\n So I was, and I wasn't about to sit in the waiting room.\n\n2:29:57.500 --> 2:29:58.860\n Have you tried that social network,\n\n2:29:58.860 --> 2:29:59.860\n by the way, the Clubhouse?\n\n2:29:59.860 --> 2:30:03.020\n I've gone in there a few times and checked some things out.\n\n2:30:03.020 --> 2:30:05.060\n I'm there, I have a few questions about it\n\n2:30:05.060 --> 2:30:07.920\n that like if I'm in there,\n\n2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:11.660\n how one can participate or not participate.\n\n2:30:11.660 --> 2:30:13.900\n I like being a fly on the wall for those conversations.\n\n2:30:13.900 --> 2:30:15.740\n I've been very curious as to what's going on in there.\n\n2:30:15.740 --> 2:30:18.620\n Oh, it's quite, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts.\n\n2:30:18.620 --> 2:30:20.980\n Maybe it's useful to comment.\n\n2:30:20.980 --> 2:30:23.380\n I also have a Discord server\n\n2:30:23.380 --> 2:30:27.580\n that has a few tens of thousands of people on it.\n\n2:30:27.580 --> 2:30:31.860\n And then they have also a voice chat capability.\n\n2:30:31.860 --> 2:30:33.820\n So there's these get togethers.\n\n2:30:33.820 --> 2:30:37.580\n And I was using it in the spring and summer,\n\n2:30:37.580 --> 2:30:40.700\n like actively on those voice discussions.\n\n2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:44.980\n And it's anywhere from 10 to like 1,000 people\n\n2:30:44.980 --> 2:30:46.540\n all together in voice.\n\n2:30:46.540 --> 2:30:49.180\n Like anyone can speak anytime, right?\n\n2:30:49.180 --> 2:30:52.300\n But there's this weird dynamic that people stay quiet.\n\n2:30:52.300 --> 2:30:54.140\n Only one person speaks at a time\n\n2:30:54.140 --> 2:30:55.560\n because they're all like respectful.\n\n2:30:55.560 --> 2:30:59.260\n And it's a community of like fundamentally\n\n2:30:59.260 --> 2:31:01.860\n respectful people, even though they're all anonymous.\n\n2:31:01.860 --> 2:31:04.940\n So like, except like me and a few others,\n\n2:31:04.940 --> 2:31:06.260\n it's all anonymous people.\n\n2:31:06.260 --> 2:31:08.300\n It's so interesting and it works.\n\n2:31:08.300 --> 2:31:13.220\n But the magical thing to me about that community\n\n2:31:14.220 --> 2:31:17.500\n was how intimate voice only communication can be.\n\n2:31:18.540 --> 2:31:23.540\n It felt as intimate as like a small get together\n\n2:31:24.720 --> 2:31:27.740\n at a home with close friends.\n\n2:31:27.740 --> 2:31:29.900\n It felt like there's a calmness to it.\n\n2:31:29.900 --> 2:31:33.700\n And you're revealing things about, you know,\n\n2:31:33.700 --> 2:31:37.140\n somebody suffering from depression or being suicidal.\n\n2:31:37.140 --> 2:31:39.700\n So those are the dark things or being super excited,\n\n2:31:39.700 --> 2:31:42.140\n getting a new girlfriend or boyfriend.\n\n2:31:42.140 --> 2:31:46.580\n Like just the depth of human experience shared on voice\n\n2:31:46.580 --> 2:31:49.860\n without video is, I was really surprised\n\n2:31:49.860 --> 2:31:52.060\n how intimate that is for human connection,\n\n2:31:52.060 --> 2:31:54.460\n especially in this time of COVID, it replaced that.\n\n2:31:54.460 --> 2:31:59.100\n So just to give you some context, there's something there.\n\n2:31:59.100 --> 2:32:00.140\n There's definitely something there.\n\n2:32:00.140 --> 2:32:03.100\n One thing that comes to mind is when like in Clubhouse,\n\n2:32:03.100 --> 2:32:04.300\n you have your little icon.\n\n2:32:04.300 --> 2:32:06.420\n So they don't actually, you don't see your face moving.\n\n2:32:06.420 --> 2:32:08.800\n I think when people see their own image,\n\n2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:11.540\n it puts them in a state of self consciousness\n\n2:32:11.540 --> 2:32:15.620\n that is eliminated by just having an icon or an avatar.\n\n2:32:15.620 --> 2:32:20.200\n So like Zoom is dreadful because if I'm not used\n\n2:32:20.200 --> 2:32:22.440\n to talking to people and seeing a little image of myself\n\n2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:24.300\n staring back at me in the mirror.\n\n2:32:24.300 --> 2:32:26.580\n And it's just, I know there are ways\n\n2:32:26.580 --> 2:32:29.180\n that you can adjust that, but it's really awful.\n\n2:32:29.180 --> 2:32:31.620\n And I think that when I get on Zooms now,\n\n2:32:31.620 --> 2:32:34.540\n I say hello and then I shut down the video component.\n\n2:32:34.540 --> 2:32:35.660\n And then I just talk in the end.\n\n2:32:35.660 --> 2:32:38.840\n I come back on just to show that still there, it's still me.\n\n2:32:38.840 --> 2:32:42.140\n But I think that voice only is really interesting.\n\n2:32:42.140 --> 2:32:43.860\n Eddie Chang would be an interesting person\n\n2:32:43.860 --> 2:32:45.940\n to talk to about this because he understands so much\n\n2:32:45.940 --> 2:32:48.300\n about how inflection communicates\n\n2:32:48.300 --> 2:32:50.140\n emotionality in deeper state.\n\n2:32:50.140 --> 2:32:52.740\n But there's a balance between, I think,\n\n2:32:52.740 --> 2:32:54.780\n just like you said, this is the privacy\n\n2:32:55.960 --> 2:32:59.100\n somehow allows for the intimacy.\n\n2:32:59.100 --> 2:33:03.260\n So like being able to, as opposed to putting on an act,\n\n2:33:03.260 --> 2:33:05.340\n which I realize we do when we're visually\n\n2:33:05.340 --> 2:33:08.300\n presenting ourselves in remote communication.\n\n2:33:08.300 --> 2:33:10.040\n But I think that there's so few places\n\n2:33:10.040 --> 2:33:12.280\n where people can actually communicate\n\n2:33:12.280 --> 2:33:14.300\n without the fear of penalty.\n\n2:33:15.380 --> 2:33:19.280\n That's woefully absent these days.\n\n2:33:19.280 --> 2:33:21.860\n And so maybe people are just relieved to be in a place\n\n2:33:21.860 --> 2:33:24.120\n where they feel like I can say what I want\n\n2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:26.460\n or not say anything and it's okay.\n\n2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:30.140\n And so Clubhouse, to answer your kind of question is,\n\n2:33:31.020 --> 2:33:33.180\n there was a big improvement to me over Discord,\n\n2:33:33.180 --> 2:33:37.820\n which is it has tiers, it has a stage where people,\n\n2:33:37.820 --> 2:33:40.340\n the person that created the room can invite people up\n\n2:33:40.340 --> 2:33:42.660\n that would like to speak potentially,\n\n2:33:42.660 --> 2:33:43.860\n have the opportunity to speak.\n\n2:33:43.860 --> 2:33:45.940\n And then there's a bigger audience\n\n2:33:45.940 --> 2:33:48.420\n that don't get a chance to speak unless they\n\n2:33:48.420 --> 2:33:51.060\n click raise their hand and they get called on.\n\n2:33:51.060 --> 2:33:54.580\n So there's like a tier system that allows\n\n2:33:54.580 --> 2:33:59.260\n for there to be a group of like five, 10, 20, 30 people\n\n2:33:59.260 --> 2:34:03.380\n talking and a lot larger amount in the audience,\n\n2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:06.020\n which in Discord was the problems that everybody could talk.\n\n2:34:06.020 --> 2:34:09.300\n And the other thing about Clubhouse is everybody\n\n2:34:09.300 --> 2:34:11.600\n is strongly encouraged to represent themselves.\n\n2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:14.980\n So you're using your real name, it's not anonymous.\n\n2:34:14.980 --> 2:34:18.140\n And how many people were in that GameStop discussion\n\n2:34:18.140 --> 2:34:18.980\n the other day?\n\n2:34:18.980 --> 2:34:23.320\n They currently limit rooms to 5,000.\n\n2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:25.260\n So I'm sure maxed out at 5,000.\n\n2:34:25.260 --> 2:34:27.620\n There's a lot of overflow rooms.\n\n2:34:27.620 --> 2:34:29.420\n This is the cool thing about Clubhouse,\n\n2:34:29.420 --> 2:34:32.220\n really big people were on there all tuned in\n\n2:34:32.220 --> 2:34:35.940\n and having a conversation, having all from,\n\n2:34:35.940 --> 2:34:39.700\n all these different worlds being able to connect,\n\n2:34:39.700 --> 2:34:42.640\n even though without the niceties of like arranging\n\n2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:44.740\n the meeting, you could just show up and leave,\n\n2:34:44.740 --> 2:34:45.820\n which is really nice.\n\n2:34:45.820 --> 2:34:50.280\n But the reason for my lessons from Discord,\n\n2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:54.080\n I'm going to mostly stay away from Clubhouse.\n\n2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:56.100\n And I think.\n\n2:34:56.100 --> 2:34:58.080\n Or go in there under another name.\n\n2:34:58.080 --> 2:34:58.920\n Right.\n\n2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:02.600\n I'll pretend I know the actual, your actual name.\n\n2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:06.960\n Yeah, it's, I've learned, it's quite addicting.\n\n2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:08.560\n It's a time sink.\n\n2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:12.600\n It's so, the intimacy of it is you find yourself\n\n2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:14.160\n wasting quite a bit of time on there.\n\n2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:15.520\n It pulls you in.\n\n2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:16.760\n Well, it's interesting.\n\n2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:20.800\n They would in sort of going back to the podcast\n\n2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:22.480\n or earlier, we're talking about books\n\n2:35:22.480 --> 2:35:24.480\n or creating a technology.\n\n2:35:24.480 --> 2:35:27.240\n One thing that's absolutely clear is that anything\n\n2:35:27.240 --> 2:35:31.200\n that's easy to reproduce is probably not worth\n\n2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:33.420\n much effort and time.\n\n2:35:33.420 --> 2:35:34.260\n Yes.\n\n2:35:34.260 --> 2:35:35.100\n Right?\n\n2:35:35.100 --> 2:35:39.320\n I mean, most posts could be easily reproduced.\n\n2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:40.280\n You just repost them.\n\n2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:41.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:44.180\n So now there are some original posts that for which\n\n2:35:44.180 --> 2:35:46.200\n the attribution goes to the original person\n\n2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:48.000\n and it's clear it came from you.\n\n2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.400\n But anything that can be easily reproduced is,\n\n2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:53.660\n doesn't really expand us very much as individuals\n\n2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:55.280\n or as groups.\n\n2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:57.900\n And most of what I see on social media is stuff\n\n2:35:57.900 --> 2:36:00.400\n that is purely reproduced.\n\n2:36:00.400 --> 2:36:01.420\n Yes.\n\n2:36:01.420 --> 2:36:05.840\n But I think Clubhouse, I mean, it could be\n\n2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:08.200\n that some real magic emerges on there.\n\n2:36:08.200 --> 2:36:10.220\n So in moderation could be good.\n\n2:36:10.220 --> 2:36:13.840\n The magic is, this is another thing that I've found\n\n2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:18.840\n through COVID that maybe you can think about is live.\n\n2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:24.560\n I used to be, not understand the appeal of live video\n\n2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:28.880\n or live connection or like in this Clubhouse live events.\n\n2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:32.440\n Because Clubhouse is technically, for the most part,\n\n2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:34.040\n it's not supposed to be recorded.\n\n2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:36.520\n Most people don't record most conversations.\n\n2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:38.560\n It's a one time live event.\n\n2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:40.280\n And there's a magic to that.\n\n2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:41.120\n There is.\n\n2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:44.640\n That's not captured by like your podcast\n\n2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:49.360\n or my podcast produced video that's like recorded,\n\n2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:50.960\n like packaged up.\n\n2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:52.420\n Well, anything can happen.\n\n2:36:52.420 --> 2:36:54.200\n It's that anything can happen.\n\n2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:57.400\n And that's the kind of thing like live concerts.\n\n2:36:57.400 --> 2:37:00.440\n I definitely, I love live music.\n\n2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:02.040\n And it's the idea that,\n\n2:37:02.040 --> 2:37:03.440\n cause you can always listen to the album.\n\n2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:05.840\n Actually the album usually sounds cleaner and better,\n\n2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:08.300\n but it's just this idea that anything can happen.\n\n2:37:08.300 --> 2:37:10.740\n And then you listen to like the parts, I don't know,\n\n2:37:10.740 --> 2:37:13.800\n you like a Costello did something weird.\n\n2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:15.200\n Your dog did something weird.\n\n2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:17.040\n And then you have to go, God damn it.\n\n2:37:17.040 --> 2:37:19.760\n You have to go to the kitchen or something to get something.\n\n2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:22.280\n And then you come back and it's funny.\n\n2:37:22.280 --> 2:37:24.640\n I watched live video like that of people\n\n2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:26.400\n and I'll be there for the whole time.\n\n2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:28.800\n I'll wait for them to go to the kitchen and come back.\n\n2:37:28.800 --> 2:37:30.680\n It's not like I tune out.\n\n2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:33.480\n And that makes it like a richer experience for some reason.\n\n2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:34.320\n It's weird.\n\n2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:35.400\n Well, it humanizes it.\n\n2:37:35.400 --> 2:37:36.440\n Yeah, humanizes it.\n\n2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:39.120\n And I think there is this weird effect of whether or not\n\n2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:41.320\n it's a podcast, Instagram or Twitter or anything else.\n\n2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:44.520\n There's kind of like two people shouting into a tunnel\n\n2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:46.440\n and then a bunch of people with ears at the other end\n\n2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:49.160\n of those tunnels and shouting some things back.\n\n2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:52.080\n You know, that's kind of the format we're in.\n\n2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:54.160\n I think I'll check out Clubhouse again.\n\n2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:55.640\n I've gone in there a few times during the day\n\n2:37:55.640 --> 2:37:57.480\n and I was surprised to see how many people were in there\n\n2:37:57.480 --> 2:37:58.640\n in the middle of the day.\n\n2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:01.400\n I was like, aren't these people supposed to be working?\n\n2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:02.440\n But maybe that is their work.\n\n2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:07.080\n Well, be very careful about the time sink of it.\n\n2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:09.120\n But yeah, if you want to, you and I go together,\n\n2:38:09.120 --> 2:38:10.800\n we'll have a conversation on there.\n\n2:38:10.800 --> 2:38:13.360\n But one of the things you have to figure out,\n\n2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:17.340\n I don't still know how to do it, but how to exit.\n\n2:38:17.340 --> 2:38:18.180\n Which is like.\n\n2:38:18.180 --> 2:38:20.320\n And you just do the, isn't there the leave quietly button?\n\n2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:22.600\n Yeah, no, but like when you and I are on stage\n\n2:38:22.600 --> 2:38:27.600\n having a conversation, okay, you and I is harder.\n\n2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:31.240\n But like you really, if it's just you and I,\n\n2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:33.740\n then it's the usual human communication of like,\n\n2:38:33.740 --> 2:38:35.280\n all right, I gotta go.\n\n2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:38.040\n Like, but when it's like four people,\n\n2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:40.120\n you don't want to interrupt everyone\n\n2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:41.000\n and announce you're leaving.\n\n2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.180\n You just have to, I mean, there's a weird dynamic\n\n2:38:43.180 --> 2:38:45.960\n that I haven't quite figured out of.\n\n2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:47.160\n The etiquette isn't clear.\n\n2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:48.320\n The etiquette is not clear.\n\n2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:52.060\n Well, the etiquette on different platforms\n\n2:38:52.060 --> 2:38:54.120\n and how that changes is really interesting.\n\n2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:56.360\n You know, how YouTube has one etiquette,\n\n2:38:56.360 --> 2:38:58.900\n which is kind of, it's a lot of harshness is tolerated\n\n2:38:58.900 --> 2:39:01.280\n on YouTube video comments.\n\n2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:04.000\n Twitter seems a bit harsher than Instagram.\n\n2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:05.560\n Instagram, there's kind of, it seems to be a little.\n\n2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:06.400\n People are nice.\n\n2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:07.600\n People are really nice.\n\n2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:10.440\n People are really nice on Instagram for the most part,\n\n2:39:11.300 --> 2:39:13.580\n except for those phishing things.\n\n2:39:13.580 --> 2:39:16.920\n I actually know someone who had their quite sizable account\n\n2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:18.560\n poached by those copyright.\n\n2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:19.760\n They come in with those like,\n\n2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:21.800\n you violated copyright thing.\n\n2:39:21.800 --> 2:39:23.520\n There's all sorts of harshness in there\n\n2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:25.360\n that if you think about it in the real world,\n\n2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:28.240\n I like to think about Instagram as if it was the real world.\n\n2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:30.280\n Someone comes over and is basically saying like,\n\n2:39:30.280 --> 2:39:32.520\n hey, can I hold your wallet and go into the bank\n\n2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:33.660\n and I'll get some money out for you?\n\n2:39:33.660 --> 2:39:35.400\n And like, but there's this trust\n\n2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:37.260\n based on the format it comes in\n\n2:39:37.260 --> 2:39:39.220\n that it can almost get past your radar\n\n2:39:39.220 --> 2:39:40.960\n unless you're suspicious.\n\n2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:43.520\n If you took comments, like, you know,\n\n2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:45.480\n you're posting a lot of comments and you said,\n\n2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:48.600\n you just walk past 500 random people on the street\n\n2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:50.580\n and just listen to what they say,\n\n2:39:50.580 --> 2:39:52.040\n it's like, that's ridiculous.\n\n2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:53.560\n I don't have time for that.\n\n2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:55.520\n But the comments somehow take on this importance\n\n2:39:55.520 --> 2:39:56.820\n and this relevance.\n\n2:39:56.820 --> 2:40:00.920\n And you feel, we feel obligated to give them value, right?\n\n2:40:00.920 --> 2:40:03.840\n And so the online communities,\n\n2:40:03.840 --> 2:40:05.760\n the rules really are different.\n\n2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:08.200\n And they evolve with time, which is fascinating.\n\n2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:10.020\n With Clubhouse, it's a new social network,\n\n2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:13.800\n so it's evolving and people are figuring it out as you go.\n\n2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:16.480\n And the same thing with podcasting on video\n\n2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:18.200\n and like scientific podcasting.\n\n2:40:18.200 --> 2:40:22.040\n This is the cool thing when I look at what you've created,\n\n2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:23.800\n I'm learning, I'm thinking like,\n\n2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:26.400\n hmm, that's interesting to do it this way.\n\n2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:29.340\n Because like, I have nobody to copy.\n\n2:40:29.340 --> 2:40:31.280\n Not many people to copy, you know what I mean?\n\n2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:32.560\n Well, you threw out an idea.\n\n2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:33.820\n I'm not gonna put it out here now,\n\n2:40:33.820 --> 2:40:35.280\n cause I don't wanna,\n\n2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:37.160\n cause knowing you, you'll hold yourself to it\n\n2:40:37.160 --> 2:40:38.000\n no matter what.\n\n2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:41.720\n But when we talked about this issue of the challenge\n\n2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:43.920\n of staying on a particular topic for a while,\n\n2:40:43.920 --> 2:40:46.200\n I mean, you do have some cool stuff brewing in there.\n\n2:40:46.200 --> 2:40:47.040\n Oh, no, no, no.\n\n2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:48.040\n That's separate from this format.\n\n2:40:48.040 --> 2:40:49.920\n And I love your interview format,\n\n2:40:49.920 --> 2:40:52.020\n but when you told me about that,\n\n2:40:52.020 --> 2:40:54.000\n I got really excited that you might go forward.\n\n2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:55.920\n I'm not gonna tell your audience what it is,\n\n2:40:55.920 --> 2:40:58.660\n but I will say this, it is super cool.\n\n2:40:58.660 --> 2:41:00.160\n I would have never thought about it.\n\n2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:01.600\n It's distinctly different than what I'm doing\n\n2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:03.280\n or what Lex is currently doing.\n\n2:41:03.280 --> 2:41:07.440\n And if you decide to do that podcast,\n\n2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:09.960\n I will be your first and your number one fan.\n\n2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:12.080\n And I know there are gonna be millions of other people\n\n2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:12.920\n interested in that.\n\n2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:13.920\n It would be amazing.\n\n2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:16.940\n So if you decide to go forward with the idea,\n\n2:41:18.180 --> 2:41:19.280\n that would be awesome.\n\n2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:20.220\n I was gonna say what it is,\n\n2:41:20.220 --> 2:41:22.440\n but now I'm not going to because,\n\n2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:24.000\n cause that's even more interesting.\n\n2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.600\n I brought up the clubhouse thing actually in Elon,\n\n2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:31.840\n because I just wanted to get your thoughts\n\n2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:36.840\n about something he's said a few times to me and in general,\n\n2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:40.040\n is that he's under a huge amount of stress.\n\n2:41:40.040 --> 2:41:44.480\n And I'm thinking of doing a startup now\n\n2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:47.960\n and kind of thinking about all of this.\n\n2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:51.320\n Cause I enjoy podcasts, I enjoy science,\n\n2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:56.000\n but he says that his life is basically hell.\n\n2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:57.320\n It's very difficult.\n\n2:41:57.320 --> 2:41:59.840\n He looks happy, but he's probably very good at.\n\n2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:01.160\n He's fulfilled.\n\n2:42:01.160 --> 2:42:04.240\n He's fulfilled, but the stress levels,\n\n2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:08.480\n the constant fires that he has to put out.\n\n2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:11.640\n And he says that most people wouldn't want to be me.\n\n2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:16.160\n And that basically the reason he does what he does\n\n2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:19.920\n is because there's probably something wrong with him.\n\n2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:24.200\n Like it's not, he can't help it, but do that.\n\n2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:29.080\n Kind of beautiful in a kind of Russian masochistic way.\n\n2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:31.640\n Well, I just wonder the stress.\n\n2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:35.440\n I mean, I'm sure you can imagine the kind of stress\n\n2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:39.880\n he's under because, so it's running three plus companies\n\n2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:44.880\n and there's constant, he says that every single meeting\n\n2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:49.920\n is not about like, should we install a coffee maker\n\n2:42:49.920 --> 2:42:51.760\n in the kitchen?\n\n2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:56.240\n It's like, this rocket is going to blow up\n\n2:42:56.240 --> 2:42:57.720\n and we're all fucked.\n\n2:42:57.720 --> 2:42:59.080\n I don't know what to do.\n\n2:42:59.080 --> 2:43:01.240\n And we have to, you have to fix,\n\n2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:04.040\n you have to fix real like big problems there.\n\n2:43:04.040 --> 2:43:07.720\n And like, how do you deal with that?\n\n2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:09.320\n What do you think about that kind of life?\n\n2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:13.080\n One, is there a way to walk through that fire?\n\n2:43:13.920 --> 2:43:18.920\n And two, should you walk through that fire?\n\n2:43:18.920 --> 2:43:22.120\n Well, I mean, without knowing I've never met Elon,\n\n2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:25.760\n but certainly we have common friends in you\n\n2:43:25.760 --> 2:43:29.680\n and in other people that he worked with long ago\n\n2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:34.000\n in the PayPal days, all of whom speak very highly of him\n\n2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:37.440\n and show, express immense admiration\n\n2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:40.080\n for the number of things that he can maintain.\n\n2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:43.160\n I think it's fair to say that he accomplishes more\n\n2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:48.160\n before 9 a.m. than most people do in a decade.\n\n2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:49.120\n It's clear.\n\n2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:51.560\n And that what he does would dissolve most people\n\n2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:53.120\n into a puddle of tears.\n\n2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:54.760\n Mostly because of this whole thing\n\n2:43:56.280 --> 2:43:59.600\n about the brain working hard equates\n\n2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:02.080\n to thinking about duration path and outcome\n\n2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:04.840\n and anticipating outcomes given A, B, C, or D,\n\n2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:09.400\n a lot of very scripted linear thinking and prediction.\n\n2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:11.400\n And that is hard, it's stressful.\n\n2:44:11.400 --> 2:44:14.080\n It requires intense neurochemical output.\n\n2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:16.200\n And he's doing that for multiple projects.\n\n2:44:16.200 --> 2:44:18.360\n So presumably he's buffered himself\n\n2:44:18.360 --> 2:44:21.160\n from the coffee maker issues and the little tiny issues,\n\n2:44:21.160 --> 2:44:23.880\n but he is himself, unless there's something I don't know,\n\n2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:26.280\n he's walking around in a biological system.\n\n2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:27.120\n He is.\n\n2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:29.280\n Yes, allegedly, yes.\n\n2:44:29.280 --> 2:44:30.120\n Yeah, allegedly.\n\n2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:33.600\n So, and I don't wanna reveal too much here,\n\n2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:38.600\n but I have a common coworker and colleague\n\n2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:42.760\n through some contract work I do that what I can tell you\n\n2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:45.200\n is that he's accessing the best resources\n\n2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:48.200\n in terms of how to optimize his biology.\n\n2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:51.720\n And he's thinking about that, not just for himself,\n\n2:44:51.720 --> 2:44:53.240\n but for all of Neuralink.\n\n2:44:53.240 --> 2:44:55.960\n Because I think, I'm not trying to dodge the question,\n\n2:44:55.960 --> 2:44:59.320\n but I think there's the scale of the individual,\n\n2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:02.560\n but then there's the companies that he's creating.\n\n2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:05.120\n And you've got people there that you could imagine\n\n2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:07.560\n if they're working at 10% better capacity\n\n2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:12.000\n or can focus 5% better for 20% of the day,\n\n2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:15.560\n you're looking at a enormous increase in productivity\n\n2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:17.880\n and a reduction in the time to reach goals,\n\n2:45:17.880 --> 2:45:21.120\n which will reduce the amount of stress presumably on Elon,\n\n2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:23.800\n unless he goes and starts another endeavor.\n\n2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:28.560\n So I think it's certainly not healthy for most people.\n\n2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:31.040\n It seems to be where he gets his dopamine hits.\n\n2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:34.160\n I'm also really struck by the fact that he has a family\n\n2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:38.000\n and he's got kids growing up and a relationship\n\n2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:40.960\n and all that, so it's super impressive.\n\n2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:44.880\n I think that, I don't know, how old is Elon?\n\n2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:48.520\n He's 40, I mean, pushing 50, I think 48.\n\n2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:51.320\n Even more impressive.\n\n2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:55.480\n Because many people who've been at exceedingly high output\n\n2:45:55.480 --> 2:45:58.620\n for a decade or more don't do well.\n\n2:45:58.620 --> 2:46:00.000\n Their system breaks down.\n\n2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:02.360\n Well, this is what he was saying.\n\n2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:06.800\n Actually, I mean, I don't listen to all of his interviews,\n\n2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:09.640\n but on that live on the clubhouse,\n\n2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:13.400\n he mentioned that he was kind of worried,\n\n2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:17.660\n it's interesting, he was worried that sometimes,\n\n2:46:18.780 --> 2:46:20.360\n what I think he said is,\n\n2:46:20.360 --> 2:46:25.360\n I'm worried that at some point my brain is just going to fail\n\n2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:28.880\n because of the amount of load it's under,\n\n2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:33.880\n like how much I have to think through throughout the day,\n\n2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:38.240\n like how many problems you have to think through.\n\n2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:41.240\n Like, it's like puzzles, it's constant puzzle solving.\n\n2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:43.880\n I would be concerned about taking somebody\n\n2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:46.000\n who's in that regime and suddenly putting them\n\n2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:47.640\n into a regime where they don't have enough\n\n2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:48.520\n to bite down into.\n\n2:46:48.520 --> 2:46:49.800\n It's like my bulldog, Costello,\n\n2:46:49.800 --> 2:46:51.520\n he's happiest when chewing and tugging\n\n2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:53.200\n at that big old neck of his,\n\n2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:55.080\n and he is just not going to become a retriever,\n\n2:46:55.080 --> 2:46:57.560\n he's not going to, he does well\n\n2:46:57.560 --> 2:47:00.640\n and gets his dopamine hits from chewing and pulling.\n\n2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:04.240\n And it seems like Elon has ended up where he is\n\n2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:07.800\n by way of his natural leanings.\n\n2:47:07.800 --> 2:47:12.160\n Unless there's a backstory that's trauma based or something,\n\n2:47:12.160 --> 2:47:15.240\n and I don't even begin to think that there is,\n\n2:47:15.240 --> 2:47:16.800\n it seems that he has,\n\n2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:18.680\n he's one of those rare individuals in history\n\n2:47:18.680 --> 2:47:21.240\n that has an immense drive to create\n\n2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:22.680\n in all these different domains.\n\n2:47:22.680 --> 2:47:24.360\n I'm just saying the obvious here,\n\n2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:27.360\n but it seems like that's what makes him tick.\n\n2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:29.000\n I mean, you're doing an awful lot too.\n\n2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:32.020\n Well, the problem is not really,\n\n2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:36.280\n the problem is I've been on the verge\n\n2:47:36.280 --> 2:47:39.640\n of pulling the trigger on starting a company,\n\n2:47:39.640 --> 2:47:43.160\n which will increase the workload significantly.\n\n2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:48.160\n And I'm attracted to that because of a dream I have,\n\n2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:51.960\n but it's a little bit scary\n\n2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:56.380\n because it can destroy you in a lot of ways.\n\n2:47:56.380 --> 2:47:59.120\n There's two sources of destruction.\n\n2:47:59.120 --> 2:48:02.320\n So one source is,\n\n2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:06.340\n I've, for the first time in my life,\n\n2:48:06.340 --> 2:48:10.420\n a few months ago, I think,\n\n2:48:10.420 --> 2:48:14.100\n have gotten, this feels like such a noob thing to say it,\n\n2:48:14.100 --> 2:48:16.820\n but I've gotten some hate on the internet.\n\n2:48:16.820 --> 2:48:17.740\n No.\n\n2:48:17.740 --> 2:48:18.580\n I know, right?\n\n2:48:18.580 --> 2:48:19.420\n No.\n\n2:48:19.420 --> 2:48:20.700\n But like, I am such an idiot.\n\n2:48:20.700 --> 2:48:22.900\n I'm so naive to, it was,\n\n2:48:24.520 --> 2:48:28.040\n I had the question that I guess a lot of people have\n\n2:48:28.040 --> 2:48:29.360\n when they get hate on the internet.\n\n2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:32.940\n It's like, mom, why are these people\n\n2:48:32.940 --> 2:48:35.460\n making up stuff about me?\n\n2:48:35.460 --> 2:48:39.020\n That kind of feeling of like, why are you saying that?\n\n2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:43.420\n And the reason I mentioned that is like,\n\n2:48:43.420 --> 2:48:46.340\n well, if you wanna go and start a business\n\n2:48:46.340 --> 2:48:49.780\n and do, as I think people should\n\n2:48:49.780 --> 2:48:53.380\n when they start a big, ambitious business,\n\n2:48:53.380 --> 2:48:54.980\n really try to go big.\n\n2:48:54.980 --> 2:48:58.040\n Like, what does success look like\n\n2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:00.740\n in terms of your emotional journey?\n\n2:49:00.740 --> 2:49:02.560\n You're going to have a lot of people\n\n2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:05.080\n who make up stuff about you,\n\n2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:06.680\n who say negative things.\n\n2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:09.260\n I mean, majority, hopefully, if you do a good job,\n\n2:49:09.260 --> 2:49:10.720\n will be supportive and,\n\n2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:13.480\n but there's still going to be this army of people there.\n\n2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:16.100\n And like, that was scary to me\n\n2:49:16.100 --> 2:49:20.520\n because of how much emotional impact that had on me.\n\n2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:22.880\n Well, and I also know a little bit,\n\n2:49:22.880 --> 2:49:24.240\n I have some glimpse into the fact\n\n2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:27.280\n that you put your heart and soul into everything you do.\n\n2:49:27.280 --> 2:49:30.600\n You're not a, you're lighthearted about certain things,\n\n2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:32.200\n but you're even lighthearted\n\n2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:35.980\n about being full gas pedal 24 seven.\n\n2:49:35.980 --> 2:49:37.040\n There's kind of this,\n\n2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:42.220\n Laird Hamilton always says,\n\n2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:45.340\n the big wave surfers, he always says,\n\n2:49:45.340 --> 2:49:46.640\n bright light, dark shadow.\n\n2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:50.760\n And I think it's that intensity.\n\n2:49:50.760 --> 2:49:51.720\n And when you do that,\n\n2:49:51.720 --> 2:49:54.760\n and then suddenly people are starting to like,\n\n2:49:54.760 --> 2:49:56.400\n throw some paint on your picture,\n\n2:49:56.400 --> 2:49:57.980\n you're like, wait, hold on, you know,\n\n2:49:57.980 --> 2:50:00.040\n you're going max capacity.\n\n2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:02.240\n But I think the company is interesting one\n\n2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:05.080\n because you've talked about doing this company before.\n\n2:50:05.080 --> 2:50:05.920\n I've been afraid.\n\n2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:09.360\n I just not been pulling the trigger out of fear\n\n2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:10.440\n because I enjoy this life.\n\n2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:12.560\n This is, it's starting to interrupt.\n\n2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:16.740\n It's ultimately this question of taking a leap is like,\n\n2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:21.160\n say you're in academia, it's like you're at MIT,\n\n2:50:21.160 --> 2:50:23.800\n you're, I really love doing research at MIT.\n\n2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:25.600\n I really love that life.\n\n2:50:25.600 --> 2:50:27.240\n Why take a leap out?\n\n2:50:27.240 --> 2:50:30.440\n You know, but I did because it's been a dream,\n\n2:50:30.440 --> 2:50:33.300\n but now accidentally along the way,\n\n2:50:33.300 --> 2:50:35.760\n I found this podcasting thing,\n\n2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:37.880\n which is also really fulfilling.\n\n2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:41.120\n And you know, it's like, why take a leap?\n\n2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:44.180\n Cause you have a huge lust for life.\n\n2:50:44.180 --> 2:50:45.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:50:45.020 --> 2:50:45.840\n I mean, that's you.\n\n2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:47.460\n I mean, sometimes when I'm on the internet\n\n2:50:47.460 --> 2:50:49.400\n and I think, is this, you hear about it like,\n\n2:50:49.400 --> 2:50:52.080\n oh, it's addicting, you know, YouTube's addicting all that.\n\n2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:54.720\n Actually, sometimes I think maybe that's true,\n\n2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:57.800\n but a lot of times I just think there's so much here.\n\n2:50:57.800 --> 2:50:59.520\n There's a lot of garbage,\n\n2:50:59.520 --> 2:51:02.800\n but there's so many gems out there in the world now.\n\n2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:06.580\n It's almost like, sure how you allocate time is key,\n\n2:51:06.580 --> 2:51:10.100\n but I think you can do it all.\n\n2:51:11.140 --> 2:51:14.520\n Not, maybe not five more things, but all.\n\n2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:16.240\n And one thing, I just had this idea\n\n2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:18.440\n and this is not grounded in any scientific paper,\n\n2:51:18.440 --> 2:51:20.280\n but I think the answer might come to you\n\n2:51:20.280 --> 2:51:24.440\n during this torture that you're about to get yourself\n\n2:51:24.440 --> 2:51:26.880\n through with David, because in those mental states,\n\n2:51:26.880 --> 2:51:29.320\n you're really asking the question, right?\n\n2:51:29.320 --> 2:51:32.640\n You're asking the question, where is my capacity?\n\n2:51:32.640 --> 2:51:35.600\n And am I even close to my capacity?\n\n2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:38.000\n And if I am, what's of the most value?\n\n2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:40.320\n I think we find the answers to those things\n\n2:51:40.320 --> 2:51:43.560\n in those nonverbal, nonanalytic states.\n\n2:51:43.560 --> 2:51:45.920\n It just comes to us.\n\n2:51:45.920 --> 2:51:50.600\n I hope you're right, and I hope it's a profoundly\n\n2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:52.400\n fulfilling experience as opposed to one\n\n2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:54.520\n that leads to my demise, but.\n\n2:51:54.520 --> 2:51:55.800\n You have a will, right?\n\n2:51:55.800 --> 2:51:59.200\n It all goes to the hedgehog.\n\n2:51:59.200 --> 2:52:01.660\n Yeah, exactly, to the hedgehog.\n\n2:52:01.660 --> 2:52:02.960\n Now it all makes sense.\n\n2:52:02.960 --> 2:52:06.920\n Andrew, like we talked about offline and on this podcast,\n\n2:52:06.920 --> 2:52:09.620\n I do hope we write some stuff together,\n\n2:52:09.620 --> 2:52:10.800\n do some research together.\n\n2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:15.000\n You're one of the most inspiring scientists,\n\n2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.960\n speaking of communicating to the world.\n\n2:52:18.840 --> 2:52:22.400\n So I can't wait to see what you do with the podcast.\n\n2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:23.600\n I'm already a huge fan.\n\n2:52:23.600 --> 2:52:25.400\n I've been telling everybody about it.\n\n2:52:26.300 --> 2:52:30.000\n I can't wait to see you talk to Joe as well soon.\n\n2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:32.600\n And I can't wait to see what kind of paper\n\n2:52:32.600 --> 2:52:33.440\n we write together.\n\n2:52:33.440 --> 2:52:34.840\n Thanks so much for talking to me.\n\n2:52:34.840 --> 2:52:37.020\n Thank you, that project's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n2:52:37.020 --> 2:52:39.000\n Can't wait, and thanks again for having me on.\n\n2:52:39.000 -->
