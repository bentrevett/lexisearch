00:11.680\n To me, Hardcore History is one of,\n\n00:11.680 --> 00:15.960\n if not the greatest podcast ever made.\n\n00:15.960 --> 00:19.240\n Dan and Joe Rogan are probably the two main people\n\n00:19.240 --> 00:22.880\n who got me to fall in love with the medium of podcasting\n\n00:22.880 --> 00:27.400\n as a fan and eventually as a podcaster myself.\n\n00:27.400 --> 00:29.960\n Meeting Dan was surreal.\n\n00:29.960 --> 00:33.400\n To me, he was not just a mere human like the rest of us,\n\n00:33.400 --> 00:36.000\n since his voice has been a guide\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:37.680\n through some of the darkest moments\n\n00:37.680 --> 00:39.480\n of human history for me.\n\n00:39.480 --> 00:42.120\n Meeting him was like meeting Genghis Khan,\n\n00:42.120 --> 00:45.200\n Stalin, Hitler, Alexander the Great,\n\n00:45.200 --> 00:48.460\n and all of the most powerful leaders in history all at once\n\n00:48.460 --> 00:51.880\n in a crappy hotel room in the middle of Oregon.\n\n00:51.880 --> 00:55.880\n It turns out that he is in fact just a human\n\n00:55.880 --> 00:58.720\n and truly one of the good ones.\n\n00:58.720 --> 01:01.440\n This was a pleasure and an honor for me.\n\n01:02.400 --> 01:04.280\n Quick mention of each sponsor,\n\n01:04.280 --> 01:07.360\n followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n01:07.360 --> 01:09.080\n First is Athletic Greens,\n\n01:09.080 --> 01:11.720\n the all in one drink that I start every day with\n\n01:11.720 --> 01:14.160\n to cover all my nutritional bases.\n\n01:14.160 --> 01:16.080\n Second is SimpliSafe,\n\n01:16.080 --> 01:18.260\n a home security company I use to monitor\n\n01:18.260 --> 01:20.240\n and protect my apartment.\n\n01:20.240 --> 01:22.160\n Third is Magic Spoon,\n\n01:22.160 --> 01:26.440\n low carb, keto friendly cereal that I think is delicious.\n\n01:26.440 --> 01:27.860\n And finally, Cash App,\n\n01:27.860 --> 01:31.360\n the app I use to send money to friends for food and drinks.\n\n01:31.360 --> 01:33.640\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n01:33.640 --> 01:36.800\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:37.720 --> 01:40.120\n As a side note, let me say that I think\n\n01:40.120 --> 01:42.680\n we're living through one of the most challenging moments\n\n01:42.680 --> 01:44.720\n in American history.\n\n01:44.720 --> 01:49.040\n To me, the way out is through reason and love.\n\n01:49.040 --> 01:52.100\n Both require a deep understanding of human nature\n\n01:52.100 --> 01:54.180\n and of human history.\n\n01:54.180 --> 01:56.720\n This conversation is about both.\n\n01:56.720 --> 02:01.720\n I am, perhaps hopelessly, optimistic about our future.\n\n02:01.760 --> 02:05.280\n But, if indeed we stand at the precipice\n\n02:05.280 --> 02:09.600\n of the great filter, watching our world consumed by fire,\n\n02:09.600 --> 02:12.360\n think of this little podcast conversation\n\n02:12.360 --> 02:16.920\n as the appetizer to the final meal before the apocalypse.\n\n02:17.920 --> 02:20.480\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:20.480 -->

Friedman.\n\n02:28.800 --> 02:32.720\n And now, finally, here's my conversation\n\n02:32.720 --> 02:35.200\n with the great Dan Carlin.\n\n02:36.320 --> 02:39.080\n Let's start with the highest philosophical question.\n\n02:39.080 --> 02:41.860\n Do you think human beings are fundamentally good,\n\n02:41.860 --> 02:46.680\n or are all of us capable of both good and evil,\n\n02:46.680 --> 02:50.920\n and it's the environment that molds how we,\n\n02:50.920 --> 02:53.520\n the trajectory that we take through life?\n\n02:53.520 --> 02:55.680\n How do we define evil?\n\n02:55.680 --> 02:57.960\n Evil seems to be a situational\n\n02:57.960 --> 03:00.600\n eye of the beholder kind of question.\n\n03:00.600 --> 03:04.880\n So, if we define evil, maybe I can get a better idea of,\n\n03:04.880 --> 03:08.280\n and that could be a whole show, couldn't it, defining evil.\n\n03:08.280 --> 03:10.720\n But when we say evil, what do we mean?\n\n03:10.720 --> 03:13.800\n That's a slippery one, but I think there's some way\n\n03:13.800 --> 03:17.620\n in which your existence, your presence in the world,\n\n03:17.620 --> 03:22.300\n leads to pain and suffering and destruction\n\n03:22.300 --> 03:25.000\n for many others in the rest of the world.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.800\n So, you steal the resources and you use them\n\n03:28.800 --> 03:33.800\n to create more suffering than there was before in the world.\n\n03:33.920 --> 03:35.920\n So, I suppose it's somehow deeply connected\n\n03:35.920 --> 03:39.360\n to this other slippery word, which is suffering.\n\n03:39.360 --> 03:41.780\n As you create suffering in the world,\n\n03:41.780 --> 03:43.600\n you bring suffering to the world.\n\n03:43.600 --> 03:45.160\n But here's the problem, I think, with it,\n\n03:45.160 --> 03:47.000\n because I fully see where you're going with that,\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:48.480\n and I understand it.\n\n03:48.480 --> 03:52.520\n The problem is the question of the reason\n\n03:52.520 --> 03:54.200\n for inflicting suffering.\n\n03:54.200 --> 03:58.080\n So, sometimes one might inflict suffering\n\n03:58.080 --> 04:00.800\n upon one group of individuals\n\n04:00.800 --> 04:04.360\n in order to maximize a lack of suffering\n\n04:04.360 --> 04:05.500\n with another group of individuals,\n\n04:05.500 --> 04:08.840\n or one who might not be considered evil at all\n\n04:08.840 --> 04:11.600\n might make the rational, seemingly rational choice\n\n04:11.600 --> 04:13.280\n of inflicting pain and suffering\n\n04:13.280 --> 04:15.240\n on a smaller group of people\n\n04:15.240 --> 04:17.260\n in order to maximize the opposite of that\n\n04:17.260 --> 04:19.040\n for a larger group of people.\n\n04:19.040 --> 04:20.880\n Yeah, that's one of the dark things about,\n\n04:20.880 --> 04:23.160\n I've spoken and read the work of Stephen Kotkin,\n\n04:23.160 --> 04:25.340\n I'm not sure if you're familiar with the historian,\n\n04:25.340 --> 04:30.040\n and he's basically a Stalin, a Joseph Stalin scholar.\n\n04:30.040 --> 04:31.760\n And one of the things I realized,\n\n04:32.600 --> 04:36.040\n I'm not sure where to put Hitler, but with Stalin,\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.640\n it really seems that he was sane\n\n04:41.640 --> 04:44.600\n and he thought he was doing good for the world.\n\n04:44.600 --> 04:47.960\n I really believe from everything I've read about Stalin\n\n04:47.960 --> 04:52.800\n that he believed that communism is good for the world.\n\n04:52.800 --> 04:56.320\n And if you have to kill a few people along the way,\n\n04:56.320 --> 04:57.880\n it's like you said, the small groups,\n\n04:57.880 --> 05:01.280\n if you have to sort of remove the people\n\n05:01.280 --> 05:06.280\n that stand in the way of this utopian system of communism,\n\n05:06.440 --> 05:08.640\n then that's actually good for the world.\n\n05:08.640 --> 05:12.360\n And it didn't seem to me\n\n05:12.360 --> 05:14.480\n that he could even consider the possibility\n\n05:14.480 --> 05:16.280\n that he was evil.\n\n05:16.280 --> 05:18.680\n He really thought he was doing good for the world.\n\n05:18.680 --> 05:21.960\n And that stuck with me because he's one of the most,\n\n05:21.960 --> 05:24.520\n is to our definition of evil,\n\n05:24.520 --> 05:28.000\n he seems to have brought more evil onto this world\n\n05:29.320 --> 05:31.680\n than almost any human in history.\n\n05:32.540 --> 05:35.220\n And I don't know what to do with that.\n\n05:35.220 --> 05:36.960\n Well, I'm fascinated with the concept,\n\n05:36.960 --> 05:39.120\n so fascinated by it that the very first\n\n05:39.120 --> 05:40.520\n hardcore history show we ever did,\n\n05:40.520 --> 05:42.800\n which was a full 15 or 16 minutes,\n\n05:42.800 --> 05:46.200\n was called Alexander versus Hitler.\n\n05:46.200 --> 05:51.040\n And the entire question about it was the motivations, right?\n\n05:51.040 --> 05:55.020\n So if you go to a court of law because you killed somebody,\n\n05:55.020 --> 05:56.640\n one of the things they're going to consider\n\n05:56.640 --> 05:59.000\n is why did you kill them, right?\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.300\n And if you killed somebody, for example, in self defense,\n\n06:02.300 --> 06:03.720\n you're going to be treated differently\n\n06:03.720 --> 06:05.600\n than if you malicious killed somebody\n\n06:05.600 --> 06:08.000\n maliciously to take their wallet, right?\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.680\n And in the show, we wondered,\n\n06:10.680 --> 06:12.840\n because I don't really make pronouncements,\n\n06:12.840 --> 06:17.320\n but we wondered about if you believe Hitler's writings,\n\n06:17.320 --> 06:20.720\n for example, Mein Kampf, which is written by a guy\n\n06:20.720 --> 06:22.720\n who's a political figure who wants to get,\n\n06:22.720 --> 06:24.520\n so I mean, it's about as believable\n\n06:24.520 --> 06:26.880\n as any other political tract would be.\n\n06:26.880 --> 06:31.260\n But in his mind, the things that he said that he had to do\n\n06:31.260 --> 06:35.040\n were designed for the betterment of the German people, right?\n\n06:35.040 --> 06:37.240\n Whereas Alexander the Great, once again,\n\n06:37.240 --> 06:39.360\n this is somebody from more than 2000 years ago,\n\n06:39.360 --> 06:42.280\n so with lots of propaganda in the intervening years,\n\n06:42.280 --> 06:44.880\n but one of the views of Alexander the Great\n\n06:44.880 --> 06:46.600\n is that the reason he did what he did\n\n06:46.600 --> 06:49.360\n was to, for lack of a better word,\n\n06:49.360 --> 06:51.880\n write his name in a more permanent graffiti\n\n06:51.880 --> 06:53.240\n on the pages of history, right?\n\n06:53.240 --> 06:55.160\n In other words, to glorify himself.\n\n06:55.160 --> 06:57.440\n And if that's the case,\n\n06:57.440 --> 07:00.060\n does that make Alexander a worse person than Hitler\n\n07:00.060 --> 07:02.660\n because Hitler thought he was doing good,\n\n07:02.660 --> 07:05.800\n whereas Alexander, if you believe the interpretation,\n\n07:05.800 --> 07:08.140\n was simply trying to exalt Alexander.\n\n07:08.140 --> 07:11.680\n So the motivations of the people doing these things,\n\n07:11.680 --> 07:14.180\n it seems to me, matter.\n\n07:14.180 --> 07:15.740\n I don't think you can just sit there and go,\n\n07:15.740 --> 07:17.780\n the only thing that matters is the end result,\n\n07:17.780 --> 07:20.820\n because that might've been an unintentional byproduct,\n\n07:20.820 --> 07:22.760\n in which case, that person,\n\n07:22.760 --> 07:25.640\n had you been able to show them the future,\n\n07:25.640 --> 07:27.220\n might have changed what they were doing.\n\n07:27.220 --> 07:30.880\n So were they evil or misguided or wrong or made the wrong?\n\n07:30.880 --> 07:32.360\n So, and I hate to do that\n\n07:32.360 --> 07:33.640\n because there's certain people like Hitler\n\n07:33.640 --> 07:36.360\n that I don't feel deserve the benefit of the doubt.\n\n07:36.360 --> 07:38.320\n At the same time, if you're fascinated\n\n07:38.320 --> 07:42.040\n by the concept of evil and you delve into it deeply enough,\n\n07:42.040 --> 07:43.520\n you're going to want to understand\n\n07:43.520 --> 07:46.600\n why these evil people did what they did.\n\n07:46.600 --> 07:49.240\n And sometimes it can confuse the hell out of you.\n\n07:49.240 --> 07:50.560\n You know, who wants to sit there\n\n07:50.560 --> 07:52.200\n and try to see things from Hitler's point of view\n\n07:52.200 --> 07:53.160\n to get a better understanding\n\n07:53.160 --> 07:54.760\n and sort of commiserate with.\n\n07:54.760 --> 07:57.180\n So, but I'm, obviously, first history show,\n\n07:57.180 --> 07:58.780\n I'm fascinated with the concept.\n\n07:59.680 --> 08:01.500\n So do you think it's possible,\n\n08:01.500 --> 08:03.200\n if we put ourselves in the mindset\n\n08:03.200 --> 08:05.560\n of some of the people that have led,\n\n08:05.560 --> 08:08.060\n created so much suffering in the world,\n\n08:08.060 --> 08:12.520\n that all of them had their motivations were,\n\n08:12.520 --> 08:15.180\n had good intentions underlying them?\n\n08:15.180 --> 08:17.920\n No, I don't, it's simply because there's so many,\n\n08:17.920 --> 08:20.680\n I mean, the law of averages would suggest\n\n08:20.680 --> 08:21.520\n that that's not true.\n\n08:21.520 --> 08:24.840\n I guess it is pure evil possible,\n\n08:24.840 --> 08:28.000\n meaning you, again, it's slippery,\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.360\n but you, the suffering is the goal.\n\n08:31.360 --> 08:33.280\n Suffering, intentional suffering.\n\n08:33.280 --> 08:34.120\n Yeah.\n\n08:34.120 --> 08:36.160\n Yes, I think that, and I think that there's historical\n\n08:36.160 --> 08:38.240\n figures that one could point,\n\n08:38.240 --> 08:40.480\n but that gets to the deeper question of,\n\n08:40.480 --> 08:42.340\n are these people sane?\n\n08:42.340 --> 08:43.460\n Do they have something wrong with them?\n\n08:43.460 --> 08:45.720\n Are they twisted from something in their youth?\n\n08:48.040 --> 08:50.160\n You know, these are the kinds of things\n\n08:50.160 --> 08:53.040\n where you start to delve into the psychological makeup\n\n08:53.040 --> 08:53.960\n of these people.\n\n08:53.960 --> 08:56.280\n In other words, is anybody born evil?\n\n08:56.280 --> 08:58.840\n And I actually believe that some people are.\n\n08:58.840 --> 09:01.480\n I think the DNA can get scrambled up in ways.\n\n09:01.480 --> 09:03.800\n I think the question of evil is important too,\n\n09:03.800 --> 09:05.720\n because I think it's an eye of the beholder thing.\n\n09:05.720 --> 09:09.000\n I mean, if Hitler, for example, had been successful\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:12.640\n and we were today on the sixth or seventh leader\n\n09:12.640 --> 09:16.960\n of the Third Reich, since I think his entire history\n\n09:16.960 --> 09:18.480\n would be viewed through a different lens,\n\n09:18.480 --> 09:20.720\n because that's the way we do things, right?\n\n09:20.720 --> 09:23.120\n Genghis Khan looks different to the Mongolians\n\n09:23.120 --> 09:25.960\n than he does to the residents of Baghdad, right?\n\n09:25.960 --> 09:28.880\n And I think, so an eye of the beholder question,\n\n09:28.880 --> 09:30.600\n I think comes into all these sorts of things.\n\n09:30.600 --> 09:32.720\n As you said, it's a very slippery question.\n\n09:32.720 --> 09:35.280\n Where do you put, as somebody who's fascinated\n\n09:35.280 --> 09:38.400\n by military history, where do you put violence\n\n09:41.200 --> 09:43.400\n in terms of the human condition?\n\n09:43.400 --> 09:47.040\n Is it core to being human or is it just a little tool\n\n09:47.040 --> 09:49.320\n that we use every once in a while?\n\n09:49.320 --> 09:52.000\n So I'm gonna respond to your question with a question.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:54.340\n What do you see the difference being\n\n09:54.340 --> 09:56.800\n between violence and force?\n\n09:57.720 --> 09:58.800\n Let me go farther.\n\n09:58.800 --> 10:02.760\n I'm not sure that violence is something\n\n10:02.760 --> 10:05.540\n that we have to put up with as human beings forever,\n\n10:05.540 --> 10:09.540\n that we must resign ourselves to violence forever.\n\n10:09.540 --> 10:12.760\n But I have a much harder time seeing us\n\n10:12.760 --> 10:15.680\n able to abolish force.\n\n10:15.680 --> 10:19.040\n And there's going to be some ground\n\n10:19.040 --> 10:21.680\n where if those two things are not the same,\n\n10:21.680 --> 10:23.400\n and I don't know that maybe they are,\n\n10:23.400 --> 10:25.440\n where there's certainly some crossover.\n\n10:25.440 --> 10:28.880\n And I think force, you're an engineer,\n\n10:28.880 --> 10:30.040\n you'll understand this better than I did,\n\n10:30.040 --> 10:32.020\n but think about it as a physical law.\n\n10:32.920 --> 10:34.980\n If you can't stop something from moving\n\n10:34.980 --> 10:36.940\n in a certain direction without pushing back\n\n10:36.940 --> 10:40.400\n in that same direction, I'm not sure\n\n10:40.400 --> 10:44.440\n that you can have a society or a civilization\n\n10:44.440 --> 10:48.600\n without the ability to use a counter force\n\n10:48.600 --> 10:50.520\n when things are going wrong,\n\n10:50.520 --> 10:53.080\n whether it's on an individual level, right?\n\n10:53.080 --> 10:55.060\n A person attacks another person,\n\n10:55.060 --> 10:57.720\n so you step in to save that person,\n\n10:57.720 --> 11:01.560\n or even at the highest levels of politics or anything else,\n\n11:01.560 --> 11:04.480\n a counter force to stop the inertia\n\n11:04.480 --> 11:07.280\n or the impetus of another movement.\n\n11:07.280 --> 11:11.120\n So I think that force is a simple,\n\n11:11.120 --> 11:13.940\n almost law of physics in human interaction,\n\n11:13.940 --> 11:15.640\n especially at the civilizational level.\n\n11:15.640 --> 11:18.560\n I think civilization requires a certain amount of,\n\n11:18.560 --> 11:20.680\n if not violence, then force.\n\n11:22.420 --> 11:23.920\n And again, they've talked, I mean,\n\n11:23.920 --> 11:25.680\n it goes back into St. Augustine,\n\n11:25.680 --> 11:28.800\n all kinds of Christian beliefs about the proper use of force\n\n11:28.800 --> 11:31.900\n and people have philosophically tried to decide\n\n11:31.900 --> 11:35.480\n between can you have sort of an ahimsa,\n\n11:35.480 --> 11:38.600\n Buddhists sort of, we will be nonviolent toward everything\n\n11:38.600 --> 11:42.080\n and exert no force, or there's a reason to have force\n\n11:42.080 --> 11:44.880\n in order to create the space for good.\n\n11:44.880 --> 11:47.440\n I think force is inevitable.\n\n11:47.440 --> 11:50.240\n Now, we can talk, and I've not come up\n\n11:50.240 --> 11:52.660\n to the conclusion myself, if there is a distinction\n\n11:52.660 --> 11:54.720\n to be made between force and violence.\n\n11:54.720 --> 11:58.400\n I mean, is a nonviolent force enough,\n\n11:58.400 --> 12:02.120\n or is violence when done for the cause of good\n\n12:02.120 --> 12:03.880\n a different thing than violence done\n\n12:03.880 --> 12:05.660\n either for the cause of evil, as you would say,\n\n12:05.660 --> 12:08.800\n or simply for random reasons?\n\n12:08.800 --> 12:10.800\n I mean, we humans lack control sometimes.\n\n12:10.800 --> 12:14.320\n We can be violent for no apparent reason or goal.\n\n12:14.320 --> 12:15.160\n And that's it.\n\n12:15.160 --> 12:18.000\n I mean, you look at the criminal justice system alone\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.800\n and the way we interact with people\n\n12:20.800 --> 12:23.800\n who are acting out in ways that we as a society\n\n12:23.800 --> 12:25.920\n have decided is intolerable.\n\n12:25.920 --> 12:28.000\n Can you deal with that without force\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.320\n and at some level violence?\n\n12:29.320 --> 12:30.160\n I don't know.\n\n12:30.160 --> 12:32.960\n Can you maintain peacefulness without force?\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:33.800\n I don't know.\n\n12:34.720 --> 12:36.880\n Just to be a little bit more specific\n\n12:36.880 --> 12:40.480\n about the idea of force, do you put force\n\n12:40.480 --> 12:45.400\n as general enough to include force in the space of ideas?\n\n12:45.400 --> 12:50.400\n So you mentioned Buddhism or religion or just Twitter.\n\n12:53.880 --> 12:56.320\n I can think of no things farther apart than that.\n\n12:56.320 --> 12:57.160\n Okay.\n\n12:58.400 --> 13:03.120\n Is the battles we do in the space of ideas\n\n13:03.120 --> 13:07.460\n of the great debates throughout history,\n\n13:07.460 --> 13:09.560\n do you put force into that?\n\n13:09.560 --> 13:12.720\n Or do you, in this conversation,\n\n13:12.720 --> 13:16.000\n are we trying to right now keep it to just physical force\n\n13:17.840 --> 13:20.640\n in saying that you have an intuition\n\n13:20.640 --> 13:24.260\n that force might be with us much longer than violence?\n\n13:25.120 --> 13:27.740\n I think the two bleed together.\n\n13:27.740 --> 13:32.740\n So take, because it's always my go to example.\n\n13:33.480 --> 13:35.480\n I'm afraid and I'm sure that the listeners all hate it,\n\n13:35.480 --> 13:40.360\n but take Germany during the 1920s, early 1930s,\n\n13:40.360 --> 13:42.440\n before the Nazis came to power.\n\n13:42.440 --> 13:45.160\n And they were always involved in some level of force,\n\n13:45.160 --> 13:46.960\n beating up in the streets or whatever it might be.\n\n13:46.960 --> 13:49.940\n But think about it more like an intellectual discussion\n\n13:49.940 --> 13:51.240\n until a certain point.\n\n13:53.720 --> 13:55.800\n It would be difficult, I imagine,\n\n13:55.800 --> 14:00.280\n to keep the intellectual counter force of ideas\n\n14:00.280 --> 14:02.060\n from at some point degenerating\n\n14:02.060 --> 14:06.920\n into something that's more coercion, counter force,\n\n14:06.920 --> 14:09.440\n if we want to use the phrases we were just talking about.\n\n14:09.440 --> 14:11.720\n So I think the two are intimately connected.\n\n14:11.720 --> 14:14.120\n I mean, actions follow thought, right?\n\n14:14.120 --> 14:16.840\n And at a certain point, I think,\n\n14:16.840 --> 14:20.680\n especially when one is not achieving the goals\n\n14:20.680 --> 14:24.400\n that they want to achieve through a peaceful discussion\n\n14:24.400 --> 14:27.800\n or argumentation or trying to convince the other side,\n\n14:27.800 --> 14:30.440\n that sometimes the next level of operations\n\n14:30.440 --> 14:33.280\n is something a little bit more physically imposing,\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:34.120\n if that makes sense.\n\n14:34.120 --> 14:36.360\n We go from the intellectual to the physical.\n\n14:36.360 --> 14:39.320\n Yeah, so it too easily spills over into violence.\n\n14:39.320 --> 14:41.400\n Yes, and one leads to the other often.\n\n14:41.400 --> 14:45.440\n So you kind of implied perhaps a hopeful message.\n\n14:45.440 --> 14:47.320\n Let me ask it in the form of a question.\n\n14:47.320 --> 14:49.160\n Do you think we'll always have war?\n\n14:51.280 --> 14:52.860\n I think it goes to the first question too.\n\n14:52.860 --> 14:56.720\n So for example, what do you do?\n\n14:56.720 --> 14:59.760\n I mean, let's play with nation states now,\n\n14:59.760 --> 15:02.000\n although I don't know that nation states\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.200\n are something we should think of\n\n15:03.200 --> 15:05.280\n as a permanent construct forever.\n\n15:06.120 --> 15:08.320\n But how is one nation state\n\n15:08.320 --> 15:10.720\n supposed to prevent another nation state\n\n15:10.720 --> 15:12.560\n from acting in ways that it would see\n\n15:12.560 --> 15:14.760\n as either detrimental to the global community\n\n15:14.760 --> 15:17.860\n or detrimental to the interest of their own nation state?\n\n15:20.040 --> 15:22.620\n I think we've had this question\n\n15:22.620 --> 15:25.300\n of going back to ancient times,\n\n15:25.300 --> 15:26.780\n but certainly in the 20th century,\n\n15:26.780 --> 15:27.840\n this has come up quite a bit.\n\n15:27.840 --> 15:30.360\n I mean, the whole Second World War argument\n\n15:30.360 --> 15:32.080\n sometimes revolves around the idea\n\n15:32.080 --> 15:34.760\n of what the proper counterforce should be.\n\n15:34.760 --> 15:37.080\n Can you create an entity, a league of nations,\n\n15:37.080 --> 15:41.280\n the United Nations, a one world entity maybe even\n\n15:41.280 --> 15:44.320\n that alleviates the need for counterforce\n\n15:44.320 --> 15:46.580\n involving mass violence and armies and navies\n\n15:46.580 --> 15:47.700\n and those things?\n\n15:47.700 --> 15:50.300\n I think that's an open discussion we're still having.\n\n15:51.600 --> 15:53.800\n It's good to think through that\n\n15:53.800 --> 15:57.140\n because having something like a United Nations,\n\n15:57.140 --> 15:59.060\n there's usually a centralized control.\n\n15:59.060 --> 16:01.240\n So there's humans at the top,\n\n16:01.240 --> 16:05.200\n there's committees and usually like leaders\n\n16:05.200 --> 16:07.320\n emerge as singular figures\n\n16:07.320 --> 16:10.760\n that then can become corrupted by power.\n\n16:10.760 --> 16:12.520\n And it's just a really important,\n\n16:12.520 --> 16:15.200\n it feels like a really important thought experiment\n\n16:15.200 --> 16:18.420\n and something to really rigorously think through.\n\n16:18.420 --> 16:21.040\n How can you construct systems of government\n\n16:21.960 --> 16:26.960\n that are stable enough to push us towards less and less war\n\n16:28.320 --> 16:33.320\n and less and less unstable and another tough word,\n\n16:33.320 --> 16:38.320\n another tough word which is unfair of application of force?\n\n16:39.720 --> 16:42.400\n You know, that's really at the core of the question\n\n16:42.400 --> 16:44.760\n that we're trying to figure out as humans,\n\n16:44.760 --> 16:46.720\n as our weapons get better and better and better\n\n16:46.720 --> 16:48.360\n destroying ourselves,\n\n16:48.360 --> 16:50.880\n it feels like it's important to think about\n\n16:50.880 --> 16:54.960\n how we minimize the over application\n\n16:54.960 --> 16:56.940\n or unfair application of force.\n\n16:57.860 --> 16:59.440\n There's other elements that come into play too.\n\n16:59.440 --> 17:00.440\n You and I are discussing this\n\n17:00.440 --> 17:02.720\n at the very high intellectual level of things,\n\n17:02.720 --> 17:05.440\n but there's also a tail wagging the dog element to this.\n\n17:05.440 --> 17:08.200\n So think of a society of warriors,\n\n17:08.200 --> 17:11.520\n a tribal society from a long time ago.\n\n17:11.520 --> 17:15.580\n How much do the fact that you have warriors in your society\n\n17:15.580 --> 17:17.560\n and that their reason for existing,\n\n17:17.560 --> 17:20.060\n what they take pride in, what they train for,\n\n17:20.960 --> 17:23.080\n what their status in their own civilization,\n\n17:23.080 --> 17:24.840\n how much does that itself\n\n17:24.840 --> 17:28.520\n drive the responses of that society, right?\n\n17:28.520 --> 17:33.040\n How much do you need war to legitimize warriors?\n\n17:33.040 --> 17:34.640\n That's the old argument that you get to\n\n17:34.640 --> 17:36.200\n and we've had this in the 20th century too,\n\n17:36.200 --> 17:39.320\n that the creation of arms and armies\n\n17:39.320 --> 17:42.880\n creates an incentive to use them, right?\n\n17:42.880 --> 17:45.360\n And that they themselves can drive that incentive\n\n17:45.360 --> 17:48.860\n as a justification for their reasons for existence.\n\n17:50.240 --> 17:52.720\n That's where we start to talk about the interactivity\n\n17:52.720 --> 17:55.880\n of all these different elements of society upon one another.\n\n17:55.880 --> 17:58.520\n So when we talk about governments and war,\n\n17:58.520 --> 18:00.280\n well, you need to take into account\n\n18:00.280 --> 18:02.280\n the various things those governments have put into place\n\n18:02.280 --> 18:05.120\n in terms of systems and armies and things like that\n\n18:05.120 --> 18:06.440\n to protect themselves, right?\n\n18:06.440 --> 18:08.100\n For reasons we can all understand,\n\n18:08.100 --> 18:13.100\n but they exert a force on your range of choices, don't they?\n\n18:13.240 --> 18:14.080\n It's true.\n\n18:14.080 --> 18:17.040\n You're making me realize that in my upbringing\n\n18:17.040 --> 18:21.480\n and I think upbringing of many, warriors are heroes.\n\n18:21.480 --> 18:25.120\n To me, I don't know where that feeling comes from,\n\n18:25.120 --> 18:28.400\n but to sort of die fighting\n\n18:29.560 --> 18:34.400\n is an honorable way to die, it feels like that.\n\n18:34.400 --> 18:35.640\n I've always had a problem with this\n\n18:35.640 --> 18:38.200\n because as a person interested in military history,\n\n18:38.200 --> 18:40.000\n the distinction is important\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.640\n and I try to make it at different levels.\n\n18:42.640 --> 18:45.800\n So at base level, the people who are out there\n\n18:45.800 --> 18:48.800\n on the front lines doing the fighting,\n\n18:48.800 --> 18:52.480\n to me, those people can be compared with police officers\n\n18:52.480 --> 18:55.720\n and firemen and people, fire persons,\n\n18:56.800 --> 18:59.800\n but I mean, people that are involved\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:04.800\n in an ethical attempt to perform a task\n\n19:05.140 --> 19:08.720\n which ultimately one can see in many situations\n\n19:08.720 --> 19:12.880\n as being a saving sort of task, right?\n\n19:12.880 --> 19:15.720\n Or if nothing else, a self sacrifice\n\n19:15.720 --> 19:17.320\n for what they see as the greater good.\n\n19:17.320 --> 19:20.880\n Now, I draw a distinction between the individuals\n\n19:20.880 --> 19:22.400\n and the entity that they're a part of,\n\n19:22.400 --> 19:25.280\n a military, and I certainly draw a distinction\n\n19:25.280 --> 19:27.840\n between the military and then the entire,\n\n19:27.840 --> 19:30.540\n for lack of a better word, military industrial complex\n\n19:30.540 --> 19:32.840\n that that service is a part of.\n\n19:32.840 --> 19:37.040\n I feel a lot less moral attachment\n\n19:37.040 --> 19:40.560\n to those upper echelons than I do the people on the ground.\n\n19:40.560 --> 19:42.200\n The people on the ground could be any of us\n\n19:42.200 --> 19:43.800\n and have been in a lot of,\n\n19:43.800 --> 19:46.720\n we have a very professional sort of military now\n\n19:46.720 --> 19:50.160\n where it's a very, a subset of the population,\n\n19:50.160 --> 19:53.680\n but in other periods of time, we've had conscription\n\n19:53.680 --> 19:56.640\n and drafts and it hasn't been a subset of the population,\n\n19:56.640 --> 19:58.640\n it's been the population, right?\n\n19:58.640 --> 20:01.680\n And so it is the society oftentimes going to war\n\n20:01.680 --> 20:04.480\n and I make a distinction between those warriors\n\n20:04.480 --> 20:06.920\n and the entities either in the system\n\n20:06.920 --> 20:08.240\n that they're a part of the military\n\n20:08.240 --> 20:10.700\n or the people that control the military\n\n20:10.700 --> 20:12.240\n at the highest political levels.\n\n20:12.240 --> 20:15.840\n I feel a lot less moral attachment to them\n\n20:15.840 --> 20:19.580\n and I'm much harsher about how I feel about them.\n\n20:19.580 --> 20:24.580\n I do not consider the military itself to be heroic\n\n20:25.080 --> 20:27.520\n and I do not consider the military industrial complex\n\n20:27.520 --> 20:28.800\n to be heroic.\n\n20:28.800 --> 20:31.800\n I do think that is a tail wagging the dog situation.\n\n20:31.800 --> 20:36.800\n I do think that draws us into looking at military endeavors\n\n20:36.800 --> 20:39.560\n as a solution to the problem much more quickly\n\n20:39.560 --> 20:41.160\n than we otherwise might.\n\n20:41.160 --> 20:42.880\n And to be honest, to tie it all together,\n\n20:42.880 --> 20:45.500\n I actually look at the victims of this\n\n20:45.500 --> 20:47.480\n as the soldiers we were talking about.\n\n20:47.480 --> 20:52.480\n If you set a fire to send firemen into to fight,\n\n20:53.800 --> 20:55.680\n then I feel bad for the firemen.\n\n20:55.680 --> 20:57.620\n I feel like you've abused the trust\n\n20:57.620 --> 20:58.860\n that you give those people, right?\n\n20:58.860 --> 21:01.160\n So when people talk about war,\n\n21:01.160 --> 21:03.900\n I always think that the people that we have to make sure\n\n21:03.900 --> 21:07.800\n that a war is really necessary in order to protect\n\n21:07.800 --> 21:09.220\n are the people that you're gonna send over there\n\n21:09.220 --> 21:10.060\n to fight that.\n\n21:10.060 --> 21:12.600\n The greatest victims in our society of war\n\n21:12.600 --> 21:14.200\n are often the warriors.\n\n21:14.200 --> 21:18.120\n So in my mind, when we see these people coming home\n\n21:18.120 --> 21:19.440\n from places like Iraq,\n\n21:19.440 --> 21:21.720\n a place where I would have made the argument\n\n21:21.720 --> 21:24.080\n and did at the time that we didn't belong.\n\n21:24.080 --> 21:26.520\n To me, those people are victims\n\n21:26.520 --> 21:28.040\n and I know they don't like to think about themselves\n\n21:28.040 --> 21:31.320\n that way because it runs totally counter to the ethos.\n\n21:31.320 --> 21:35.800\n But if you're sending people to protect this country's shores,\n\n21:35.800 --> 21:37.440\n those are heroes.\n\n21:37.440 --> 21:39.920\n If you're sending people to go do something\n\n21:39.920 --> 21:42.040\n that they otherwise probably don't need to do\n\n21:42.040 --> 21:43.560\n but they're there for political reasons\n\n21:43.560 --> 21:44.760\n or anything else you wanna put in\n\n21:44.760 --> 21:46.400\n that's not defense related,\n\n21:46.400 --> 21:48.680\n well then you've made victims of our heroes.\n\n21:48.680 --> 21:52.540\n And so I feel like we do a lot of talk\n\n21:52.540 --> 21:54.520\n about our troops and our soldiers and stuff\n\n21:54.520 --> 21:56.980\n but we don't treat them as valuable\n\n21:56.980 --> 21:59.640\n as the rhetoric makes them sound.\n\n21:59.640 --> 22:03.700\n Otherwise, we would be much more careful\n\n22:03.700 --> 22:05.080\n about where we put them.\n\n22:05.080 --> 22:06.800\n If you're gonna send my son,\n\n22:06.800 --> 22:07.960\n and I don't have a son, I have daughters,\n\n22:07.960 --> 22:11.760\n but if you're gonna send my son into harm's way,\n\n22:11.760 --> 22:14.460\n I'm going to demand that you really need\n\n22:14.460 --> 22:15.680\n to be sending him into harm's way\n\n22:15.680 --> 22:17.320\n and I'm going to be angry at you\n\n22:17.320 --> 22:21.240\n if you put him into harm's way if it doesn't warrant it.\n\n22:21.240 --> 22:23.800\n And so I have much more suspicion about the system\n\n22:23.800 --> 22:25.880\n that sends these people into these situations\n\n22:25.880 --> 22:28.360\n where they're required to be heroic\n\n22:28.360 --> 22:29.600\n than I do the people on the ground\n\n22:29.600 --> 22:32.680\n that I look at as either the people\n\n22:32.680 --> 22:34.980\n that are defending us in situations\n\n22:34.980 --> 22:37.160\n like the Second World War, for example,\n\n22:37.160 --> 22:41.400\n or the people that turn out to be the individual victims\n\n22:41.400 --> 22:44.000\n of a system where they're just a cog in a machine\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.920\n and the machine doesn't really care as much about them\n\n22:46.920 --> 22:51.920\n as the rhetoric and the propaganda would insinuate.\n\n22:51.920 --> 22:54.840\n Yeah, and as my own family history,\n\n22:54.840 --> 22:57.520\n it would be nice if we could talk about\n\n22:57.520 --> 23:00.060\n there's a gray area in the places\n\n23:00.060 --> 23:01.480\n that you're talking about.\n\n23:01.480 --> 23:03.040\n There's a gray area in everything.\n\n23:03.040 --> 23:03.880\n In everything.\n\n23:05.240 --> 23:08.840\n But when that gray area is part of your own blood,\n\n23:08.840 --> 23:13.840\n as it is for me, it's worth shining a light on somehow.\n\n23:16.080 --> 23:17.680\n Sure, give me an example of what you mean.\n\n23:17.680 --> 23:20.520\n So you did a program of four episodes\n\n23:20.520 --> 23:22.240\n of Ghosts of the Ostfront.\n\n23:22.240 --> 23:23.080\n Yeah.\n\n23:23.080 --> 23:26.620\n So I was born in the Soviet Union.\n\n23:26.620 --> 23:27.820\n I was raised in Moscow.\n\n23:27.820 --> 23:30.640\n My dad was born and raised in Kiev.\n\n23:30.640 --> 23:33.160\n My grandmother, who just recently passed away,\n\n23:33.160 --> 23:38.160\n was raised in Ukraine.\n\n23:38.160 --> 23:39.640\n A city.\n\n23:39.640 --> 23:44.240\n It's a small city on the border between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n23:44.240 --> 23:45.720\n I have a grandfather born in Kiev.\n\n23:45.720 --> 23:46.720\n In Kiev.\n\n23:46.720 --> 23:49.640\n The interesting thing about the timing of everything,\n\n23:49.640 --> 23:52.940\n as you might be able to connect, is she survived.\n\n23:52.940 --> 23:57.100\n She's the most badass woman I've ever encountered in my life\n\n23:57.100 --> 24:01.640\n and most of the warrior spirit I carry is probably from her.\n\n24:01.640 --> 24:04.600\n She survived Polar Mor, the Ukrainian starvation\n\n24:04.600 --> 24:05.840\n of the 30s.\n\n24:05.840 --> 24:08.600\n She was a beautiful teenage girl\n\n24:08.600 --> 24:11.200\n during the Nazi occupation of,\n\n24:11.200 --> 24:14.320\n so she survived all of that.\n\n24:14.320 --> 24:16.920\n And of course, family that everybody,\n\n24:17.720 --> 24:21.280\n and so many people died through that whole process.\n\n24:21.280 --> 24:25.240\n And one of the things you talk about in your program\n\n24:25.240 --> 24:30.240\n is that the gray area is, even with the warriors,\n\n24:30.240 --> 24:33.960\n it happened to them, just like as you're saying now,\n\n24:33.960 --> 24:35.520\n they didn't have a choice.\n\n24:35.520 --> 24:38.400\n So my grandfather on the other side,\n\n24:38.400 --> 24:43.400\n he was a machine gunner that was in Ukraine that.\n\n24:45.360 --> 24:46.840\n In the Red Army?\n\n24:46.840 --> 24:48.080\n In the Red Army, yeah.\n\n24:48.080 --> 24:53.080\n And they threw, like the statement was that there's,\n\n24:54.240 --> 24:55.520\n I don't know if it's obvious or not,\n\n24:55.520 --> 24:57.740\n but the rule was there's no surrender.\n\n24:57.740 --> 24:59.860\n So you better die.\n\n24:59.860 --> 25:02.080\n So you, I mean, you're basically,\n\n25:02.080 --> 25:04.920\n the goal was when he was fighting\n\n25:04.920 --> 25:06.400\n and he was lucky enough,\n\n25:06.400 --> 25:10.880\n one of the only to survive by being wounded early on\n\n25:10.880 --> 25:15.880\n is there was a march of Nazis towards, I guess, Moscow.\n\n25:16.560 --> 25:21.160\n And the whole goal in Ukraine was to slow every,\n\n25:21.160 --> 25:23.840\n to slow them into the winter.\n\n25:23.840 --> 25:26.800\n I mean, I view him as such a hero\n\n25:26.800 --> 25:31.640\n and he believed that he's indestructible,\n\n25:31.640 --> 25:33.760\n which is survivor bias.\n\n25:33.760 --> 25:37.880\n And that, you know, bullets can't hurt him.\n\n25:37.880 --> 25:39.640\n And that's what everybody believed.\n\n25:39.640 --> 25:43.480\n And of course, basically everyone that,\n\n25:43.480 --> 25:46.300\n he quickly rose to the ranks, let's just put it this way,\n\n25:46.300 --> 25:48.320\n because everybody died.\n\n25:48.320 --> 25:53.320\n It was just bodies dragging these heavy machine guns,\n\n25:53.620 --> 25:56.880\n like always, you know, always slowly retreating,\n\n25:56.880 --> 25:59.760\n shooting and retreating, shooting and retreating.\n\n25:59.760 --> 26:04.760\n And I don't know, he was a hero to me, like I always,\n\n26:06.600 --> 26:08.640\n I grew up thinking that he was the one\n\n26:08.640 --> 26:11.340\n that sort of defeated the Nazis, right?\n\n26:11.340 --> 26:14.200\n And, but the reality that there could be another perspective,\n\n26:14.200 --> 26:16.880\n which is all of this happened to him\n\n26:16.880 --> 26:21.280\n by the incompetence of Stalin, the incompetence\n\n26:21.280 --> 26:26.280\n and men of the Soviet Union being used like pawns\n\n26:26.280 --> 26:30.120\n in a shittily played game of chess, right?\n\n26:30.120 --> 26:35.120\n So like the one narrative is of him as a victim,\n\n26:35.500 --> 26:37.500\n as you're kind of describing.\n\n26:37.500 --> 26:42.500\n And then somehow that's more paralyzing and that's more,\n\n26:43.500 --> 26:48.500\n I don't know, it feels better to think of him as a hero\n\n26:48.620 --> 26:52.300\n and as Russia, Soviet Union saving the world.\n\n26:52.300 --> 26:53.940\n I mean, that narrative also,\n\n26:53.940 --> 26:57.860\n is in the United States that the United States was key\n\n26:57.860 --> 27:00.100\n in saving the world from the Nazis.\n\n27:00.100 --> 27:03.140\n It feels like that narrative is powerful for people.\n\n27:03.140 --> 27:06.740\n I'm not sure, and I carry it still with me,\n\n27:06.740 --> 27:09.500\n but when I think about the right way\n\n27:09.500 --> 27:11.380\n to think about that war,\n\n27:11.380 --> 27:13.580\n I'm not sure if that's the correct narrative.\n\n27:14.580 --> 27:15.940\n Let me suggest something.\n\n27:15.940 --> 27:20.940\n There's a line that a Marine named Eugene Sledge had to say\n\n27:20.940 --> 27:23.940\n once and I keep it on my phone because it's,\n\n27:23.940 --> 27:25.860\n it makes a real distinction.\n\n27:25.860 --> 27:30.300\n And he said, the front line is really where the war is.\n\n27:30.300 --> 27:33.900\n And anybody, even a hundred yards behind the front line\n\n27:33.900 --> 27:36.500\n doesn't know what it's really like.\n\n27:36.500 --> 27:39.940\n Now, the difference is, is there are lots of people miles\n\n27:39.940 --> 27:42.140\n behind the front line that are in danger, right?\n\n27:42.140 --> 27:44.180\n You can be in a medical unit in the rear\n\n27:44.180 --> 27:46.980\n and artillery could strike you, planes could strike me.\n\n27:46.980 --> 27:48.300\n You could be in danger,\n\n27:48.300 --> 27:50.980\n but at the front line, there are two different things.\n\n27:50.980 --> 27:53.940\n One is that, and at least,\n\n27:53.940 --> 27:55.580\n and I'm doing a lot of reading on this right now\n\n27:55.580 --> 27:57.820\n and reading a lot of veterans accounts.\n\n27:57.820 --> 28:01.700\n James Jones, who wrote books like From Here to Eternity,\n\n28:01.700 --> 28:03.660\n fictional accounts of the Second World War,\n\n28:03.660 --> 28:05.700\n but he based them on his own service.\n\n28:05.700 --> 28:08.980\n He was at Guadalcanal, for example, in 1942.\n\n28:08.980 --> 28:12.460\n And Jones had said that the evolution of a soldier\n\n28:12.460 --> 28:16.020\n in front line action requires a lot of\n\n28:16.020 --> 28:20.180\n front line action requires an almost surrendering\n\n28:20.180 --> 28:22.460\n to the idea that you're going to live,\n\n28:22.460 --> 28:24.780\n that you become accustomed to the idea\n\n28:24.780 --> 28:26.340\n that you're going to die.\n\n28:26.340 --> 28:28.500\n And he said, you're a different person\n\n28:28.500 --> 28:31.340\n simply for considering that thought seriously,\n\n28:31.340 --> 28:32.980\n because most of us don't.\n\n28:32.980 --> 28:35.460\n But what that allows you to do is to do that job\n\n28:35.460 --> 28:36.740\n at the front line, right?\n\n28:36.740 --> 28:40.340\n If you're too concerned about your own life,\n\n28:40.340 --> 28:44.460\n you become less of a good guy at your job, right?\n\n28:44.460 --> 28:47.220\n The other thing that the people in the 100 yards\n\n28:47.220 --> 28:49.220\n at the front line do that the people\n\n28:49.220 --> 28:51.620\n in the rear medical unit really don't,\n\n28:51.620 --> 28:54.100\n is you kill and you kill a lot, right?\n\n28:54.100 --> 28:55.820\n You don't just, oh, there's a sniper back here\n\n28:55.820 --> 28:56.740\n so I shot him.\n\n28:56.740 --> 28:58.900\n It's we go from one position to another\n\n28:58.900 --> 29:01.060\n and we kill lots of people.\n\n29:01.060 --> 29:02.620\n Those things will change you.\n\n29:02.620 --> 29:05.420\n And what that tends to do, not universally,\n\n29:05.420 --> 29:08.420\n because I've read accounts from Red Army soldiers\n\n29:08.420 --> 29:10.700\n and they're very patriotic, right?\n\n29:10.700 --> 29:13.620\n But a lot of that patriotism comes through years later\n\n29:13.620 --> 29:16.620\n as part of the nostalgia and the remembering.\n\n29:16.620 --> 29:19.300\n When you're down at that front 100 yards,\n\n29:19.300 --> 29:22.140\n it is often boiled down to a very small world.\n\n29:22.140 --> 29:24.580\n So your grandfather, was it your grandfather?\n\n29:24.580 --> 29:25.420\n Grandfather.\n\n29:25.420 --> 29:28.900\n At the machine gun, he's concerned about his position\n\n29:28.900 --> 29:30.700\n and his comrades and the people\n\n29:30.700 --> 29:32.740\n who he owes a responsibility to.\n\n29:32.740 --> 29:35.380\n And those, it's a very small world at that point.\n\n29:35.380 --> 29:37.420\n And to me, that's where the heroism is, right?\n\n29:37.420 --> 29:39.860\n He's not fighting for some giant world,\n\n29:39.860 --> 29:40.940\n civilizational thing.\n\n29:40.940 --> 29:43.540\n He's fighting to save the people next to him.\n\n29:43.540 --> 29:44.980\n And his own life at the same time\n\n29:44.980 --> 29:46.940\n because they're saving him too.\n\n29:46.940 --> 29:49.900\n And that there is a huge amount of heroism to that.\n\n29:49.900 --> 29:52.220\n And that gets to our question about force earlier.\n\n29:52.220 --> 29:53.780\n Why would you use force?\n\n29:53.780 --> 29:55.700\n Well, how about to protect these people\n\n29:55.700 --> 29:56.740\n on either side of me, right?\n\n29:56.740 --> 29:57.720\n Their lives.\n\n29:59.020 --> 30:01.060\n Now, is there hatred?\n\n30:01.060 --> 30:03.300\n Yeah, I hated the Germans for what they were doing.\n\n30:03.300 --> 30:06.220\n As a matter of fact, I got a note from a poll\n\n30:06.220 --> 30:07.420\n not that long ago.\n\n30:07.420 --> 30:10.740\n And I have this tendency to refer to the Nazis, right?\n\n30:10.740 --> 30:12.420\n The regime that was, and he said,\n\n30:12.420 --> 30:14.060\n why do you keep calling them Nazis?\n\n30:14.060 --> 30:15.740\n He says, say what they were.\n\n30:15.740 --> 30:17.020\n They were Germans.\n\n30:17.020 --> 30:21.240\n And this guy wanted me to not absolve Germany\n\n30:21.240 --> 30:23.460\n by saying, oh, it was this awful group of people\n\n30:23.460 --> 30:24.540\n that took over your country.\n\n30:24.540 --> 30:26.340\n He said, the Germans did this.\n\n30:26.340 --> 30:28.540\n And there's that bitterness where he says,\n\n30:28.540 --> 30:30.860\n let's not forget what they did to us\n\n30:30.860 --> 30:33.740\n and what we had to do back, right?\n\n30:33.740 --> 30:37.140\n So for me, when we talk about these combat situations,\n\n30:37.140 --> 30:40.240\n the reason I call these people heroic is because of,\n\n30:40.240 --> 30:42.860\n they're fighting to defend things we could all understand.\n\n30:42.860 --> 30:45.300\n I mean, if you come after my brother\n\n30:45.300 --> 30:47.580\n and I take a machine gun and shoot you\n\n30:48.540 --> 30:49.580\n and you're gonna overrun me,\n\n30:49.580 --> 30:51.980\n I mean, that becomes a situation\n\n30:51.980 --> 30:54.180\n where we talked about counterforce earlier.\n\n30:55.140 --> 30:56.920\n Much easier to call yourself a hero\n\n30:56.920 --> 30:57.980\n when you're saving people\n\n30:57.980 --> 30:59.860\n or you're saving this town right behind you.\n\n30:59.860 --> 31:02.340\n And you know, if they get through your machine gun,\n\n31:02.340 --> 31:03.520\n they're gonna burn these villages.\n\n31:03.520 --> 31:04.580\n They're gonna throw these people out\n\n31:04.580 --> 31:06.680\n in the middle of winter, these families.\n\n31:06.680 --> 31:09.420\n That to me is a very different sort of heroism\n\n31:09.420 --> 31:13.060\n than this amorphous idea of patriotism.\n\n31:13.060 --> 31:14.340\n And you know, patriotism is a thing\n\n31:14.340 --> 31:17.460\n that we often get used with, right?\n\n31:17.460 --> 31:21.440\n People manipulate us through love of country and all this\n\n31:21.440 --> 31:22.340\n because they understand\n\n31:22.340 --> 31:24.020\n that this is something we feel very strongly,\n\n31:24.020 --> 31:26.480\n but they use it against us sometimes\n\n31:26.480 --> 31:29.460\n in order to whip up a war fever or to get people.\n\n31:29.460 --> 31:30.980\n I mean, there's a great line\n\n31:30.980 --> 31:32.660\n and I wish I could remember it in its entirety\n\n31:32.660 --> 31:35.460\n that Herman Goering had said about how easy it was\n\n31:35.460 --> 31:37.240\n to get the people into a war.\n\n31:37.240 --> 31:39.380\n He says, you know, you just appeal to their patriotism,\n\n31:39.380 --> 31:41.540\n you, I mean, there's buttons that you can push\n\n31:41.540 --> 31:44.500\n and they take advantage of things like love of country\n\n31:44.500 --> 31:48.080\n and the way we have a loyalty and an admiration\n\n31:48.080 --> 31:50.180\n to the warriors who put their lives on the line.\n\n31:50.180 --> 31:53.860\n These are manipulatable things in the human species\n\n31:53.860 --> 31:57.740\n that reliably can be counted on to move us\n\n31:57.740 --> 32:02.740\n in directions that in a more sober, reflective state of mind\n\n32:03.740 --> 32:05.140\n we would consider differently.\n\n32:05.140 --> 32:07.020\n It gets the, I mean, you get this war fever up\n\n32:07.020 --> 32:09.940\n and people wave flags and they start denouncing the enemy\n\n32:09.940 --> 32:11.920\n and they start signing, you know, we've seen it over\n\n32:11.920 --> 32:14.660\n and over and over again in ancient times this happened.\n\n32:14.660 --> 32:17.340\n But the love of country is also beautiful.\n\n32:17.340 --> 32:19.900\n So I haven't seen it in America as much.\n\n32:19.900 --> 32:22.180\n So people in America love their country,\n\n32:22.180 --> 32:24.820\n like this patriotism is strong in America,\n\n32:24.820 --> 32:27.520\n but it's not as strong as I remember,\n\n32:27.520 --> 32:30.420\n even with my sort of being younger,\n\n32:30.420 --> 32:32.860\n the love of the Soviet Union.\n\n32:33.780 --> 32:36.680\n Now, was it the Soviet Union this requires a distinction\n\n32:36.680 --> 32:39.140\n or was it mother Russia?\n\n32:39.140 --> 32:41.300\n What it really was, was the communist party.\n\n32:41.300 --> 32:43.660\n Okay, so it was the system in place, okay.\n\n32:43.660 --> 32:46.340\n The system in place, like loving,\n\n32:46.340 --> 32:49.980\n I haven't quite deeply synchronized exactly what you love.\n\n32:49.980 --> 32:54.980\n I think you love that like populist message of the worker,\n\n32:56.540 --> 32:59.100\n of the common man, the common person.\n\n32:59.100 --> 33:01.440\n Let me draw the comparison then.\n\n33:01.440 --> 33:04.560\n And I often say this, that the United States\n\n33:04.560 --> 33:09.560\n like the Soviet Union is an ideological based society, right?\n\n33:09.940 --> 33:12.560\n So you take a country like France,\n\n33:13.380 --> 33:16.100\n it doesn't matter which French government you're in now.\n\n33:16.100 --> 33:19.060\n The French have been the French for a long time, right?\n\n33:19.060 --> 33:22.700\n It's not based on an ideology, right?\n\n33:22.700 --> 33:26.260\n Whereas what unites the United States is an ideology,\n\n33:26.260 --> 33:28.460\n freedom, liberty, the constitution.\n\n33:28.460 --> 33:29.500\n This is what draws, you know,\n\n33:29.500 --> 33:32.100\n it's the e pluribus unum kind of the idea, right?\n\n33:32.100 --> 33:34.900\n That out of many one, well, what binds\n\n33:34.900 --> 33:37.020\n all these unique different people?\n\n33:37.020 --> 33:39.380\n The shared beliefs, this ideology.\n\n33:39.380 --> 33:40.780\n The Soviet Union was the same way.\n\n33:40.780 --> 33:42.180\n Cause as you know, the Soviet Union,\n\n33:42.180 --> 33:45.860\n Russia was merely one part of the Soviet Union.\n\n33:45.860 --> 33:49.180\n And if you believe the rhetoric until Stalin's time,\n\n33:49.180 --> 33:52.000\n everybody was going to be united\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.300\n under this ideological banner someday, right?\n\n33:54.300 --> 33:56.040\n It was a global revolution.\n\n33:56.920 --> 33:59.100\n So ideological societies are different.\n\n33:59.100 --> 34:03.840\n And to be a fan of the ideological framework and goal,\n\n34:03.840 --> 34:05.860\n I mean, I'm a Liberty person, right?\n\n34:05.860 --> 34:08.500\n I would like to see everybody in the world\n\n34:08.500 --> 34:09.760\n have my system of government,\n\n34:09.760 --> 34:12.460\n which is part of a bias, right?\n\n34:12.460 --> 34:14.220\n Because they might not want that.\n\n34:14.220 --> 34:16.020\n But I think it's better for everyone\n\n34:16.020 --> 34:17.860\n cause I think it's better for me.\n\n34:17.860 --> 34:20.900\n At the same time, when the ideology,\n\n34:20.900 --> 34:22.380\n if you consider, and you know,\n\n34:22.380 --> 34:25.300\n this stems from ideas of the enlightenment\n\n34:25.300 --> 34:26.620\n and there's a bias there.\n\n34:26.620 --> 34:28.860\n So my bias are toward the, but you feel,\n\n34:28.860 --> 34:29.700\n and this is why you say,\n\n34:29.700 --> 34:30.780\n we're going to bring freedom to Iraq.\n\n34:30.780 --> 34:31.620\n We're going to bring freedom to here.\n\n34:31.620 --> 34:32.460\n We're going to bring freedom\n\n34:32.460 --> 34:34.340\n because we think we're spreading to you\n\n34:34.340 --> 34:37.940\n something that is just undeniably positive.\n\n34:37.940 --> 34:40.900\n We're going to free you and give you this.\n\n34:42.900 --> 34:47.780\n It's hard for me to wipe my own bias away from there, right?\n\n34:47.780 --> 34:50.220\n Cause if I were in Iraq, for example,\n\n34:50.220 --> 34:51.860\n I would want freedom, right?\n\n34:51.860 --> 34:54.780\n But if you then leave and let the Iraqis vote\n\n34:54.780 --> 34:56.300\n for whomever they want,\n\n34:56.300 --> 34:58.660\n are they going to vote for somebody that will,\n\n34:58.660 --> 35:01.540\n I mean, you know, you look at Russia now\n\n35:01.540 --> 35:03.140\n and I hear from Russians quite a bit\n\n35:03.140 --> 35:06.660\n because so much of my views on Russia\n\n35:06.660 --> 35:09.820\n and the Soviet Union were formed in my formative years.\n\n35:09.820 --> 35:12.700\n And, you know, we were not hearing from many people\n\n35:12.700 --> 35:14.860\n in the Soviet Union back then, but now you do.\n\n35:14.860 --> 35:16.500\n You hear from Russians today who will say,\n\n35:16.500 --> 35:18.980\n your views on Stalin are archaic and cold.\n\n35:18.980 --> 35:21.780\n You know, so you try to reorient your beliefs a little bit,\n\n35:21.780 --> 35:23.260\n but it goes to this idea of,\n\n35:23.260 --> 35:27.060\n if you gave the people in Russia a free and fair vote,\n\n35:27.060 --> 35:29.260\n will they vote for somebody who promises them\n\n35:29.260 --> 35:30.660\n a free and open society\n\n35:30.660 --> 35:33.060\n based on enlightenment democratic principles?\n\n35:33.060 --> 35:34.180\n Or will they vote for somebody,\n\n35:34.180 --> 35:36.260\n we in the US would go, what are they doing?\n\n35:36.260 --> 35:38.540\n They're voting for some strong man who's just good.\n\n35:38.540 --> 35:41.940\n You know, so I think it's very hard to throw away\n\n35:41.940 --> 35:45.220\n our own biases and preconceptions.\n\n35:45.220 --> 35:48.780\n And, you know, it's an all eye of the beholder kind of thing.\n\n35:48.780 --> 35:52.060\n But when you're talking about ideological societies,\n\n35:52.060 --> 35:55.100\n it is very difficult to throw off\n\n35:55.100 --> 35:57.140\n all the years of indoctrination\n\n35:57.140 --> 35:59.660\n into the superiority of your system.\n\n35:59.660 --> 36:01.500\n I mean, listen, in the Soviet Union,\n\n36:01.500 --> 36:04.780\n Marxism one way or another was part of every classrooms.\n\n36:04.780 --> 36:06.640\n You know, you could be studying geometry\n\n36:06.640 --> 36:09.080\n and they'll throw Marxism in there somehow,\n\n36:09.080 --> 36:11.580\n because that's what united the society.\n\n36:11.580 --> 36:13.540\n And that's what gave it a higher purpose.\n\n36:13.540 --> 36:16.500\n And that's what made it in the minds of the people\n\n36:16.500 --> 36:17.820\n who were its defenders,\n\n36:17.820 --> 36:20.500\n a superior, morally superior system.\n\n36:20.500 --> 36:21.680\n And we do the same thing here.\n\n36:21.680 --> 36:24.820\n In fact, most people do, but see, you're still French,\n\n36:24.820 --> 36:28.100\n no matter what the ideology or the government might be.\n\n36:28.100 --> 36:29.780\n So in that sense,\n\n36:29.780 --> 36:31.720\n it's funny that there would be a cold war\n\n36:31.720 --> 36:32.800\n with these two systems,\n\n36:32.800 --> 36:35.620\n because they're both ideologically based systems\n\n36:35.620 --> 36:38.300\n involving peoples of many different backgrounds\n\n36:38.300 --> 36:42.060\n who are united under the umbrella of the ideology.\n\n36:42.060 --> 36:45.120\n First of all, that's brilliantly put.\n\n36:45.120 --> 36:48.620\n I'm in a funny position that in my formative years,\n\n36:48.620 --> 36:50.160\n I came here when I was 13,\n\n36:50.160 --> 36:55.160\n is when I, you know, teenage is your first love or whatever,\n\n36:55.840 --> 36:59.700\n is I fell in love with the American set of ideas\n\n36:59.700 --> 37:00.960\n of freedom and individuals.\n\n37:00.960 --> 37:01.800\n They're compelling, aren't they?\n\n37:01.800 --> 37:02.840\n Yes. They're compelling, yes.\n\n37:02.840 --> 37:05.080\n But I also remember, it's like you remember\n\n37:05.080 --> 37:07.480\n like maybe an ex girlfriend or something like that.\n\n37:07.480 --> 37:12.480\n I also remember loving as a very different human,\n\n37:13.300 --> 37:17.780\n the Soviet idea, like we had the national anthem,\n\n37:17.780 --> 37:20.880\n which is still, I think the most badass national anthem,\n\n37:20.880 --> 37:22.600\n which is the Soviet Union,\n\n37:22.600 --> 37:24.760\n like saying we're the indestructible nation.\n\n37:24.760 --> 37:26.920\n I mean, just the words are so,\n\n37:26.920 --> 37:29.760\n like Americans words are like, oh, we're nice.\n\n37:29.760 --> 37:31.320\n Like we're freedom,\n\n37:31.320 --> 37:34.580\n but like a Russian Soviet Union national anthem was like,\n\n37:34.580 --> 37:35.980\n we're bad motherfuckers.\n\n37:35.980 --> 37:38.120\n Nobody will destroy us.\n\n37:38.120 --> 37:41.860\n I just remember feeling pride in a nation as a kid,\n\n37:41.860 --> 37:43.320\n like dumb not knowing anything\n\n37:43.320 --> 37:45.360\n because we all had to recite the stuff.\n\n37:45.360 --> 37:48.520\n It was, there's a uniformity to everything.\n\n37:48.520 --> 37:50.460\n There's pride underlying everything.\n\n37:50.460 --> 37:52.960\n I didn't think about all the destructive nature\n\n37:52.960 --> 37:56.380\n of the bureaucracy, the incompetence,\n\n37:56.380 --> 37:59.020\n the, you know, all the things that come\n\n37:59.020 --> 38:01.880\n with the implementation of communism,\n\n38:01.880 --> 38:05.120\n especially around the eighties and nineties.\n\n38:06.120 --> 38:09.640\n But I remember what it's like to love that set of ideas.\n\n38:09.640 --> 38:12.280\n So I'm in a funny place of like,\n\n38:12.280 --> 38:14.600\n remember like switching the love\n\n38:14.600 --> 38:15.600\n because I'm, you know,\n\n38:15.600 --> 38:18.200\n I kind of joke around about being Russian,\n\n38:18.200 --> 38:21.280\n but you know, my longterm monogamous relationship\n\n38:21.280 --> 38:23.780\n is now with the idea, the American ideal.\n\n38:23.780 --> 38:25.900\n Like I'm stuck with it in my mind,\n\n38:25.900 --> 38:28.920\n but I remember what it was like to love it.\n\n38:28.920 --> 38:30.400\n And I think about that too,\n\n38:30.400 --> 38:33.420\n when people criticize China or they criticize\n\n38:33.420 --> 38:37.260\n the current state of affairs with how Stalin is remembered\n\n38:37.260 --> 38:42.260\n and how Putin is to know that the,\n\n38:42.260 --> 38:47.260\n you can't always wear the American ideal of individualism,\n\n38:48.220 --> 38:50.660\n radical individualism and freedom\n\n38:50.660 --> 38:54.620\n in analyzing the ways of the world elsewhere.\n\n38:54.620 --> 38:58.220\n Like in China, in Russia, that it does,\n\n38:59.160 --> 39:01.360\n if you don't take yourself too seriously,\n\n39:01.360 --> 39:03.300\n as Americans all do, as I do,\n\n39:04.380 --> 39:09.220\n it's kind of a beautiful love to have for your government,\n\n39:09.220 --> 39:13.100\n to believe in the nation, to let go of yourself\n\n39:13.100 --> 39:15.340\n and your rights and your freedoms,\n\n39:15.340 --> 39:18.000\n to believe in something bigger than yourself.\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:22.020\n That's actually, that's a kind of freedom.\n\n39:22.020 --> 39:24.660\n That's, you're actually liberating yourself.\n\n39:24.660 --> 39:26.700\n If you think like life is suffering,\n\n39:26.700 --> 39:30.180\n you're giving into the flow of the water,\n\n39:30.180 --> 39:32.200\n the flow, the way of the world\n\n39:32.200 --> 39:35.020\n by giving away more power from yourself\n\n39:35.020 --> 39:37.340\n and giving it to what you would conceive as,\n\n39:37.340 --> 39:40.080\n as the power of the people together,\n\n39:40.080 --> 39:41.480\n together we'll do great things\n\n39:41.480 --> 39:46.480\n and really believing in the ideals of what,\n\n39:46.540 --> 39:50.300\n in this case, I don't even know what you would call Russia,\n\n39:50.300 --> 39:51.660\n but whatever the heck that is,\n\n39:51.660 --> 39:56.460\n authoritarian, powerful state, powerful leader,\n\n39:56.460 --> 40:00.120\n believing that can be as beautiful\n\n40:00.120 --> 40:02.280\n as believing the American ideal.\n\n40:02.280 --> 40:04.460\n Not just that, let me add to what you're saying.\n\n40:04.460 --> 40:07.740\n And I'm very, I spend a lot of time\n\n40:07.740 --> 40:11.240\n trying to get out of my own biases.\n\n40:11.240 --> 40:14.320\n It is a fruitless endeavor longterm,\n\n40:14.320 --> 40:16.260\n but you try to be better than you normally are.\n\n40:16.260 --> 40:19.160\n One of the critiques that China,\n\n40:19.160 --> 40:20.620\n and I always, as an American,\n\n40:20.620 --> 40:22.660\n I tend to think about this as their government, right?\n\n40:22.660 --> 40:25.240\n This is a rationale that their government puts forward.\n\n40:25.240 --> 40:27.900\n But what you just said is actually,\n\n40:27.900 --> 40:30.460\n if you can make that viewpoint beautiful\n\n40:30.460 --> 40:32.260\n is kind of a beautiful way of approaching it.\n\n40:32.260 --> 40:36.060\n The Chinese would say that what we call human rights\n\n40:36.060 --> 40:37.700\n in the United States and what we consider\n\n40:37.700 --> 40:40.500\n to be everybody's birthright around the world\n\n40:40.500 --> 40:42.900\n is instead Western rights.\n\n40:42.900 --> 40:44.500\n That's the words they use, Western rights.\n\n40:44.500 --> 40:47.980\n It's a fundamentally Western oriented,\n\n40:47.980 --> 40:51.300\n and I'll go back to the enlightenment based ideas,\n\n40:52.660 --> 40:55.540\n on what constitutes the rights of man.\n\n40:55.540 --> 40:58.540\n And they would suggest that that's not internationally\n\n40:58.540 --> 41:00.380\n and always applicable, right?\n\n41:00.380 --> 41:03.460\n That you can make a case, and again, I don't believe this.\n\n41:03.460 --> 41:05.340\n This runs against my own personal views,\n\n41:05.340 --> 41:07.100\n but that you could make a case\n\n41:07.100 --> 41:10.540\n that the collective wellbeing of a very large group\n\n41:10.540 --> 41:14.180\n of people outweighs the individual needs\n\n41:14.180 --> 41:17.280\n of any single person, especially if those things\n\n41:17.280 --> 41:18.920\n are in conflict with each other, right?\n\n41:18.920 --> 41:21.660\n If you cannot provide for the greater good\n\n41:21.660 --> 41:24.260\n because everyone's so individualistic,\n\n41:24.260 --> 41:27.060\n well then really what is the better thing to do, right?\n\n41:27.060 --> 41:30.440\n Is suppress individualism so everybody's better off?\n\n41:30.440 --> 41:34.780\n I think trying to recognize how someone else might see that\n\n41:34.780 --> 41:36.260\n is important if we want to, you know,\n\n41:36.260 --> 41:37.860\n you had talked about eliminating war.\n\n41:37.860 --> 41:39.980\n We talk about eliminating conflict.\n\n41:39.980 --> 41:42.700\n The first need to do that is to try to understand\n\n41:42.700 --> 41:44.860\n how someone else might view something differently\n\n41:44.860 --> 41:45.720\n than yourself.\n\n41:47.340 --> 41:50.500\n I'm famously one of those people who buys in\n\n41:50.500 --> 41:53.780\n to the ideas of traditional Americanism, right?\n\n41:53.780 --> 41:56.540\n And look, what a lot of people who live today,\n\n41:56.540 --> 42:00.540\n I mean, they would seem to think that things like patriotism\n\n42:00.540 --> 42:04.100\n requires a belief in the strong military\n\n42:04.100 --> 42:05.040\n and all these things we have today,\n\n42:05.040 --> 42:07.480\n but that is a corruption of traditional Americanism,\n\n42:07.480 --> 42:10.120\n which viewed all those things with suspicion\n\n42:10.120 --> 42:12.020\n in the first hundred years of the Republic\n\n42:12.020 --> 42:15.260\n because they saw it as an enemy to the very things\n\n42:15.260 --> 42:17.140\n that Americans celebrated, right?\n\n42:17.140 --> 42:20.100\n How could you have freedom and liberty\n\n42:20.100 --> 42:23.100\n and individualistic expression\n\n42:23.100 --> 42:24.900\n if you had an overriding military\n\n42:24.900 --> 42:26.740\n that was always fighting wars\n\n42:26.740 --> 42:29.340\n and the founders of this country looked to other examples\n\n42:29.340 --> 42:30.820\n like Europe, for example,\n\n42:30.820 --> 42:33.420\n and saw that standing militaries, for example,\n\n42:33.420 --> 42:36.720\n standing armies were the enemy of liberty.\n\n42:36.720 --> 42:38.740\n Well, we have a standing army now\n\n42:38.740 --> 42:43.320\n and one that is totally interwoven in our entire society.\n\n42:43.320 --> 42:47.740\n If you could go back in time and talk to John Quincy Adams,\n\n42:47.740 --> 42:49.500\n right, early president of the United States\n\n42:49.500 --> 42:51.540\n and show him what we have now,\n\n42:51.540 --> 42:54.700\n he would think it was awful and horrible\n\n42:54.700 --> 42:56.980\n and that somewhere along the line,\n\n42:56.980 --> 42:59.820\n the Americans had lost their way\n\n42:59.820 --> 43:01.780\n and forgotten what they were all about.\n\n43:01.780 --> 43:04.860\n But we have so successfully interwoven\n\n43:04.860 --> 43:08.340\n this modern military industrial complex\n\n43:08.340 --> 43:11.820\n with the traditional benefits\n\n43:11.820 --> 43:14.020\n of the American system and ideology\n\n43:14.020 --> 43:16.100\n so that they've become intertwined in our thinking,\n\n43:16.100 --> 43:19.260\n whereas 150 years ago, they were actually considered\n\n43:19.260 --> 43:22.820\n to be at opposite polarities and a threat to one another.\n\n43:22.820 --> 43:27.060\n So when you talk about the love of the nation,\n\n43:27.060 --> 43:29.300\n I tend to be suspicious of those things.\n\n43:29.300 --> 43:31.040\n I tend to be suspicious of government.\n\n43:31.040 --> 43:34.540\n I tend to try very hard to not be manipulated\n\n43:34.540 --> 43:37.680\n and I feel like a large part of what they do\n\n43:37.680 --> 43:40.020\n is manipulation and propaganda.\n\n43:40.020 --> 43:45.020\n And so I think a healthy skepticism of the nation state\n\n43:45.180 --> 43:47.980\n is actually 100% Americanism\n\n43:47.980 --> 43:50.000\n in the traditional sense of the word.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:51.420\n But I also have to recognize,\n\n43:51.420 --> 43:53.980\n as you so eloquently stated,\n\n43:53.980 --> 43:58.700\n Americanism is not necessarily universal at all.\n\n43:58.700 --> 44:02.620\n And so I think we have to try to be more understanding.\n\n44:02.620 --> 44:05.980\n See, the traditional American viewpoint\n\n44:05.980 --> 44:07.460\n is that if a place like China\n\n44:07.460 --> 44:10.280\n does not allow their people individual human rights,\n\n44:10.280 --> 44:12.260\n then they're being denied something.\n\n44:12.260 --> 44:14.720\n They're being denied and 100 years ago,\n\n44:14.720 --> 44:17.180\n they would have said they're God given rights.\n\n44:17.180 --> 44:19.400\n Man is born free and if he's not free,\n\n44:19.400 --> 44:22.100\n it's because of something done to him, right?\n\n44:22.100 --> 44:25.500\n The government has taken away his God given rights.\n\n44:25.500 --> 44:27.620\n I'm getting excited just listening to that.\n\n44:27.620 --> 44:31.260\n Well, but I mean, I think the idea that this is universal\n\n44:31.260 --> 44:33.980\n is in and of itself a bias.\n\n44:33.980 --> 44:36.140\n Now, do I want freedom for everybody else?\n\n44:36.140 --> 44:36.980\n I sure do.\n\n44:36.980 --> 44:38.220\n But the people in the Soviet Union\n\n44:38.220 --> 44:40.220\n who really bought into that\n\n44:40.220 --> 44:42.500\n wanted the workers of the world to unite\n\n44:42.500 --> 44:47.060\n and not be exploited by the greedy blood sucking people\n\n44:47.060 --> 44:50.260\n who worked them to death and pocketed all of the fruits\n\n44:50.260 --> 44:51.460\n of their labor.\n\n44:51.460 --> 44:52.780\n If you frame it that way,\n\n44:52.780 --> 44:55.260\n that sounds like justice as well, you know?\n\n44:55.260 --> 44:58.380\n So it is an eye of the beholder sort of thing.\n\n44:58.380 --> 45:03.380\n I'd love to talk to you about Vladimir Putin,\n\n45:03.640 --> 45:08.320\n sort of while we're in this feeling and wave of empathy\n\n45:08.320 --> 45:11.200\n and trying to understand others that are not like us.\n\n45:12.060 --> 45:15.120\n One of the reasons I started this podcast\n\n45:15.120 --> 45:17.320\n is because I believe that there's a few people\n\n45:17.320 --> 45:18.940\n I could talk to.\n\n45:18.940 --> 45:21.060\n Some of it is ego.\n\n45:21.060 --> 45:24.000\n Some of it is stupidity.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.500\n Is there some people I could talk to\n\n45:26.500 --> 45:28.840\n that not many others can talk to?\n\n45:29.700 --> 45:31.780\n The one person I was always thinking about\n\n45:31.780 --> 45:33.660\n was Vladimir Putin.\n\n45:33.660 --> 45:35.020\n Do you still speak the language?\n\n45:35.020 --> 45:36.420\n I speak the language very well.\n\n45:36.420 --> 45:37.940\n That makes it even easier.\n\n45:37.940 --> 45:41.160\n I mean, you might be appointed for that job.\n\n45:41.160 --> 45:43.640\n That's the context in which I'm asking you this question.\n\n45:43.640 --> 45:48.640\n What are your thoughts about Vladimir Putin\n\n45:48.660 --> 45:50.680\n from a historical context?\n\n45:51.540 --> 45:52.700\n Have you studied him?\n\n45:52.700 --> 45:54.220\n Have you thought about him?\n\n45:54.220 --> 45:57.560\n Yes, studied is a loaded word.\n\n45:59.340 --> 46:02.020\n And again, I find it hard sometimes\n\n46:02.020 --> 46:05.220\n to not filter things through an American lens.\n\n46:05.220 --> 46:07.180\n So as an American,\n\n46:07.180 --> 46:10.240\n I would say that the Russians should be allowed\n\n46:10.240 --> 46:12.720\n to have any leader that they want to have.\n\n46:12.720 --> 46:15.040\n But what an American would say is,\n\n46:15.040 --> 46:17.120\n but there should be elections, right?\n\n46:17.120 --> 46:20.040\n So if the Russians choose Vladimir Putin\n\n46:20.040 --> 46:23.720\n and they keep choosing him, that's their business.\n\n46:23.720 --> 46:26.720\n Where as an American, I would have a problem\n\n46:26.720 --> 46:29.880\n is when that leader stops letting the Russians\n\n46:29.880 --> 46:30.900\n make that decision.\n\n46:30.900 --> 46:33.780\n And we would say, well, now you're no longer\n\n46:33.780 --> 46:36.420\n ruling by the consent of the governed.\n\n46:36.420 --> 46:38.420\n You've become the equivalent of a person\n\n46:38.420 --> 46:40.620\n who may be oppressing your people.\n\n46:40.620 --> 46:42.800\n You might as well be a dictator, right?\n\n46:42.800 --> 46:45.900\n Now there's a difference between a freely elected\n\n46:45.900 --> 46:49.580\n and reelected and reelected and reelected dictator, right?\n\n46:49.580 --> 46:50.420\n If that's what they want.\n\n46:50.420 --> 46:54.600\n And look, it would be silly to broad brush the Russians\n\n46:54.600 --> 46:56.760\n like it would be silly to broad brush anyone, right?\n\n46:56.760 --> 46:57.880\n Millions and millions of people\n\n46:57.880 --> 46:59.900\n with different opinions amongst them all.\n\n46:59.900 --> 47:03.260\n But they seem to like a strong person at the helm.\n\n47:03.260 --> 47:05.340\n And listen, there's a giant chunk of Americans\n\n47:05.340 --> 47:08.260\n who do too in their own country.\n\n47:08.260 --> 47:12.300\n But an American would say, as long as the freedom of choice\n\n47:12.300 --> 47:15.140\n is given to the Russians to decide this\n\n47:15.140 --> 47:16.980\n and not taken away from them, right?\n\n47:16.980 --> 47:18.580\n It's one thing to say he was freely elected,\n\n47:18.580 --> 47:20.580\n but a long time ago and we've done away with elections\n\n47:20.580 --> 47:23.300\n since then is a different story too.\n\n47:23.300 --> 47:25.580\n So my attitude on Vladimir Putin\n\n47:25.580 --> 47:27.500\n is if that's who the Russian people want\n\n47:27.500 --> 47:29.340\n and you give them the choice, right?\n\n47:29.340 --> 47:31.580\n If he's only there because they keep electing him,\n\n47:31.580 --> 47:32.740\n that's a very different story.\n\n47:32.740 --> 47:36.420\n When he stops offering them the option\n\n47:36.420 --> 47:38.220\n of choosing him or not choosing him,\n\n47:38.220 --> 47:40.060\n that's when it begins to look nefarious\n\n47:40.060 --> 47:42.900\n to someone born and raised with the mindset\n\n47:42.900 --> 47:46.260\n and the ideology that is an integral part of yours truly.\n\n47:46.260 --> 47:48.700\n And that I can't, you can see gray areas\n\n47:48.700 --> 47:51.380\n and nuance all you like, but it's hard to escape.\n\n47:51.380 --> 47:52.960\n And you alluded to this too.\n\n47:52.960 --> 47:56.380\n It's hard to escape what was indoctrinated\n\n47:56.380 --> 47:59.260\n into your bones in your formative years.\n\n47:59.260 --> 48:02.220\n It's like, your bones are growing, right?\n\n48:02.220 --> 48:03.700\n And you can't go back.\n\n48:03.700 --> 48:06.340\n So to me, this is so much a part of who I am\n\n48:06.340 --> 48:09.360\n that I have a hard time jettisoning that and saying,\n\n48:09.360 --> 48:11.700\n oh no, Vladimir Putin not being elected anymore,\n\n48:11.700 --> 48:12.900\n it's just fine.\n\n48:12.900 --> 48:16.780\n I'm too much of a product of my upbringing to go there.\n\n48:16.780 --> 48:17.620\n Does that make sense?\n\n48:17.620 --> 48:18.460\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n48:18.460 --> 48:20.160\n But of course there's, like we were saying,\n\n48:20.160 --> 48:23.820\n there's gray areas, which is, I believe,\n\n48:23.820 --> 48:24.980\n I have to think through this,\n\n48:24.980 --> 48:28.420\n but I think there is a point at which Adolf Hitler\n\n48:28.420 --> 48:32.940\n became the popular choice in Nazi Germany in the 30s.\n\n48:32.940 --> 48:37.660\n There's a, in the same way, from an American perspective,\n\n48:37.660 --> 48:42.660\n you can start to criticize some in a shallow way,\n\n48:42.860 --> 48:43.940\n some in a deep way.\n\n48:43.940 --> 48:47.360\n The way that Putin has maintained power\n\n48:47.360 --> 48:48.620\n is by controlling the press.\n\n48:48.620 --> 48:51.320\n So limiting one other freedom that we Americans value,\n\n48:51.320 --> 48:55.040\n which is the freedom of the press or freedom of speech\n\n48:55.040 --> 48:57.740\n that he, it is very possible.\n\n48:57.740 --> 49:00.360\n Now things are changing now,\n\n49:00.360 --> 49:03.260\n but for most of his presidency,\n\n49:03.260 --> 49:06.780\n he was the popular choice and sometimes by far.\n\n49:06.780 --> 49:11.780\n And I have, I actually don't have real family in Russia\n\n49:12.580 --> 49:14.120\n who don't love Putin.\n\n49:15.020 --> 49:17.820\n The only people who write to me about Putin\n\n49:17.820 --> 49:22.380\n and not liking him are like sort of activists\n\n49:22.380 --> 49:24.740\n who are young, right?\n\n49:24.740 --> 49:26.900\n But like to me, they're strangers.\n\n49:26.900 --> 49:28.300\n I don't know anything about them.\n\n49:28.300 --> 49:31.140\n The people I do know who have a big family in Russia,\n\n49:32.300 --> 49:34.980\n they love Putin.\n\n49:34.980 --> 49:35.820\n They...\n\n49:35.820 --> 49:37.140\n Do they miss elections?\n\n49:41.860 --> 49:45.940\n Would they want the choice to prove it at the ballot box?\n\n49:45.940 --> 49:49.920\n And, or are they so in love with him\n\n49:49.920 --> 49:52.440\n that they wouldn't wanna take a chance\n\n49:52.440 --> 49:54.540\n that someone might vote him out?\n\n49:54.540 --> 49:56.220\n No, they don't think of it this way.\n\n49:56.220 --> 50:00.300\n And they are aware of the incredible bureaucracy\n\n50:00.300 --> 50:03.520\n and corruption that is lurking in the shadows,\n\n50:03.520 --> 50:05.540\n which is true in Russia.\n\n50:05.540 --> 50:06.640\n Everywhere.\n\n50:06.640 --> 50:07.480\n Everywhere.\n\n50:07.480 --> 50:09.700\n But like, there's something about the Russian,\n\n50:09.700 --> 50:14.520\n it's a remnants, corruption is so deeply part of the Russian,\n\n50:14.520 --> 50:18.540\n so the Soviet system that even the overthrow of the Soviet,\n\n50:18.540 --> 50:21.900\n the breaking apart of the Soviet Union\n\n50:21.900 --> 50:26.900\n and Putin coming and reforming a lot of the system,\n\n50:27.100 --> 50:28.980\n it's still deeply in there.\n\n50:28.980 --> 50:31.000\n And they're aware of that.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.300\n That's part of the, like the love for Putin\n\n50:33.300 --> 50:38.060\n is partially grounded in the fear of what happens\n\n50:38.060 --> 50:42.100\n when the corrupt take over, the greedy take over.\n\n50:42.100 --> 50:44.940\n And they see Putin as the stabilizer,\n\n50:44.940 --> 50:49.380\n as like a hard like force that says...\n\n50:49.380 --> 50:50.380\n A counter force.\n\n50:50.380 --> 50:53.020\n Counter force that get your shit together.\n\n50:53.020 --> 50:56.180\n Like basically, from the Western perspective,\n\n50:56.180 --> 51:01.180\n Putin is terrible, but from the Russian perspective,\n\n51:01.820 --> 51:04.580\n Putin is the only thing holding this thing together\n\n51:04.580 --> 51:07.340\n before it goes, if it collapses.\n\n51:07.340 --> 51:11.780\n Now, from the, like Gary Kasparov has been loud on this,\n\n51:11.780 --> 51:14.540\n a lot of people from the Western perspective say,\n\n51:14.540 --> 51:17.300\n well, if it has to collapse, let it collapse.\n\n51:17.300 --> 51:18.140\n You know, that's...\n\n51:18.140 --> 51:18.980\n That's easier said than done\n\n51:18.980 --> 51:20.140\n when you don't have to live through that.\n\n51:20.140 --> 51:21.180\n Exactly.\n\n51:21.180 --> 51:23.940\n And so anyone worrying about their family about...\n\n51:23.940 --> 51:28.860\n And they also remember the inflation\n\n51:28.860 --> 51:30.420\n and the economic instability\n\n51:30.420 --> 51:31.920\n and the suffering and the starvation\n\n51:31.920 --> 51:33.700\n that happened in the 90s with the collapse\n\n51:33.700 --> 51:35.100\n of the Soviet Union.\n\n51:35.100 --> 51:36.940\n And they saw the kind of reform\n\n51:36.940 --> 51:39.060\n and the economic vibrancy that happened\n\n51:39.060 --> 51:40.500\n when Putin took power,\n\n51:40.500 --> 51:43.480\n that they think like, this guy's holding it together.\n\n51:43.480 --> 51:48.480\n And they see elections as potentially\n\n51:48.480 --> 51:53.080\n being mechanisms by which the corrupt people\n\n51:53.080 --> 51:55.280\n can manipulate the system unfairly,\n\n51:55.280 --> 51:58.160\n as opposed to letting the people speak with their voice.\n\n51:58.160 --> 52:03.120\n They somehow figure out a way to manipulate the elections,\n\n52:03.120 --> 52:08.120\n to elect somebody like one of them Western revolutionaries.\n\n52:08.160 --> 52:11.600\n And so I think one of the beliefs\n\n52:11.600 --> 52:13.580\n that's important to the American system\n\n52:13.580 --> 52:17.880\n is the belief in the electoral system\n\n52:17.880 --> 52:20.400\n that the voice of the people can be heard\n\n52:20.400 --> 52:22.480\n in the various systems of government,\n\n52:22.480 --> 52:24.480\n whether it's judicial, whether it's...\n\n52:25.920 --> 52:29.080\n I mean, basically the assumption is\n\n52:29.080 --> 52:31.600\n that the system works well enough\n\n52:31.600 --> 52:36.600\n for you to be able to elect the popular choice.\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:38.620\n Okay, so there's a couple of things\n\n52:38.620 --> 52:40.660\n that come to mind on that.\n\n52:40.660 --> 52:45.400\n The first one has to do with the idea of oligarchs.\n\n52:45.400 --> 52:48.240\n There's a belief in political science,\n\n52:48.240 --> 52:50.420\n you know, it's not the overall belief,\n\n52:50.420 --> 52:53.560\n but that every society is sort of an oligarchy really,\n\n52:53.560 --> 52:55.340\n if you break it down, right?\n\n52:55.340 --> 52:57.800\n So what you're talking about are some of the people\n\n52:57.800 --> 53:02.720\n who would form an oligarchic class in Russia,\n\n53:02.720 --> 53:06.240\n and that Putin is the guy who can harness\n\n53:06.240 --> 53:10.040\n the power of the state to keep those people in check.\n\n53:10.040 --> 53:12.360\n The problem, of course, in a system like that,\n\n53:12.360 --> 53:13.920\n a strong man system, right?\n\n53:13.920 --> 53:16.520\n Where you have somebody who can hold the reins\n\n53:16.520 --> 53:20.280\n and steer the ship when the ship is violently in a storm,\n\n53:20.280 --> 53:21.860\n is the succession.\n\n53:21.860 --> 53:25.180\n So if you're not creating a system\n\n53:25.180 --> 53:27.640\n that can operate without you,\n\n53:27.640 --> 53:31.720\n then that terrible instability and that terrible future\n\n53:31.720 --> 53:35.200\n that you justify the strong man for\n\n53:35.200 --> 53:37.480\n is just awaiting your future, right?\n\n53:37.480 --> 53:41.380\n I mean, unless he's actively building the system\n\n53:41.380 --> 53:44.720\n that will outlive him and allow successors\n\n53:44.720 --> 53:46.480\n to do what he's doing,\n\n53:46.480 --> 53:49.040\n then what you've done here is create a temporary,\n\n53:49.040 --> 53:51.040\n I would think, a temporary stability here,\n\n53:51.040 --> 53:54.120\n because it's the same problem you have in a monarchy, right?\n\n53:54.120 --> 53:57.480\n Where you have this one king and he's particularly good,\n\n53:57.480 --> 53:59.340\n or you think he's particularly good,\n\n53:59.340 --> 54:00.760\n but he's gonna turn that job over\n\n54:00.760 --> 54:02.680\n to somebody else down the road,\n\n54:02.680 --> 54:04.320\n and the system doesn't guarantee\n\n54:04.320 --> 54:07.480\n because no one's really worked on,\n\n54:07.480 --> 54:08.920\n and again, you would tell me,\n\n54:08.920 --> 54:11.120\n if Putin is putting into place,\n\n54:11.120 --> 54:13.080\n I know he's talked about it over the years,\n\n54:13.080 --> 54:15.800\n putting into place a system that can outlive him\n\n54:15.800 --> 54:17.320\n and that will create the stability\n\n54:17.320 --> 54:21.640\n that the people in Russia like him for when he's gone,\n\n54:21.640 --> 54:24.000\n because if the oligarchs just take over afterwards,\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:25.640\n then one might argue,\n\n54:25.640 --> 54:28.180\n well, we had 20 good years of stability,\n\n54:28.180 --> 54:29.280\n but I mean, I would say\n\n54:29.280 --> 54:32.560\n that if we're talking about a ship of state here,\n\n54:32.560 --> 54:34.100\n the guy steering the ship, maybe,\n\n54:34.100 --> 54:35.760\n if you wanted to look at it from the Russian point of view,\n\n54:35.760 --> 54:38.320\n has done a great job, maybe, just saying,\n\n54:38.320 --> 54:39.920\n but the rocks are still out there,\n\n54:39.920 --> 54:42.520\n and he's not going to be at the helm forever,\n\n54:42.520 --> 54:45.000\n so one would think that his job is to make sure\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.460\n that there's going to be someone\n\n54:47.460 --> 54:49.040\n who can continue to steer the ship\n\n54:49.040 --> 54:51.340\n for the people of Russia after he's gone.\n\n54:51.340 --> 54:53.440\n Now, let me ask, because I'm curious,\n\n54:55.160 --> 54:58.960\n and ignorant, so is he doing that, do you think?\n\n54:58.960 --> 55:02.240\n Is he setting it up so that when there is no Putin,\n\n55:02.240 --> 55:04.000\n the state is safe?\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.960\n From the beginning, that was the idea,\n\n55:06.960 --> 55:09.240\n whether one of the fascinating things,\n\n55:09.240 --> 55:10.680\n now, I read every biography,\n\n55:10.680 --> 55:12.760\n English written biography on Putin,\n\n55:12.760 --> 55:16.420\n so I need to think more deeply,\n\n55:16.420 --> 55:17.680\n but one of the fascinating things\n\n55:17.680 --> 55:20.940\n is how did power change Vladimir Putin?\n\n55:20.940 --> 55:24.400\n He was a different man when he took power than he is today.\n\n55:24.400 --> 55:29.400\n I actually, in many ways, admire the man that took power.\n\n55:29.720 --> 55:33.160\n I think he's very different than Stalin and then Hitler\n\n55:33.160 --> 55:34.920\n at the moment they took power.\n\n55:34.920 --> 55:39.160\n I think Hitler and Stalin were both,\n\n55:39.160 --> 55:41.080\n in our previous discussion,\n\n55:41.080 --> 55:44.000\n already on the trajectory of evil.\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:49.000\n I think Putin was a humble, loyal, honest man\n\n55:49.400 --> 55:50.760\n when he took power.\n\n55:50.760 --> 55:54.560\n The man he is today is worth thinking about and studying.\n\n55:54.560 --> 55:56.560\n I'm not sure that that.\n\n55:56.560 --> 55:57.520\n That's an old line, though,\n\n55:57.520 --> 55:59.800\n about absolute power corrupting, absolutely.\n\n55:59.800 --> 56:02.780\n But it's kind of a line.\n\n56:02.780 --> 56:05.500\n It's a beautiful quote,\n\n56:05.500 --> 56:07.780\n but you have to really think about it.\n\n56:07.780 --> 56:10.420\n Like, what does that actually mean?\n\n56:10.420 --> 56:13.500\n Like, one of the things I still have to do,\n\n56:13.500 --> 56:15.740\n I've been focusing on securing the conversation, right?\n\n56:15.740 --> 56:18.980\n So I haven't gone through a dark place yet\n\n56:18.980 --> 56:21.820\n because I feel like I can't do the dark thing for too long.\n\n56:21.820 --> 56:25.220\n So I really have to put myself in the mind of Putin\n\n56:26.260 --> 56:27.920\n leading up to the conversation.\n\n56:27.920 --> 56:32.820\n But for now, my sense is he took power\n\n56:32.820 --> 56:34.700\n when Yeltsin gave him,\n\n56:34.700 --> 56:38.300\n one of the big sort of acts of the new Russia\n\n56:38.300 --> 56:42.040\n was for the first time in its history,\n\n56:42.040 --> 56:45.940\n a leader could have continued being in power\n\n56:45.940 --> 56:48.120\n and chose to give away power.\n\n56:48.120 --> 56:49.740\n That was the George Washington.\n\n56:49.740 --> 56:50.820\n Right, we in the United States\n\n56:50.820 --> 56:52.860\n would look at that as absolute positive, yeah.\n\n56:52.860 --> 56:54.420\n A sign of good things, yes.\n\n56:54.420 --> 56:56.100\n And so that was a huge act.\n\n56:56.100 --> 57:00.980\n And Putin said that that was the defining thing\n\n57:00.980 --> 57:03.580\n that will define Russia for the 21st century,\n\n57:03.580 --> 57:07.220\n that act, and he will carry that flag forward.\n\n57:07.220 --> 57:12.140\n That's why in rhetoric, he, after two terms,\n\n57:12.140 --> 57:13.180\n he gave away power.\n\n57:13.180 --> 57:15.300\n To Medvedev, but it was a puppet, right?\n\n57:15.300 --> 57:17.940\n Yeah, yes, but it was,\n\n57:17.940 --> 57:20.700\n but like still the story was being told.\n\n57:20.700 --> 57:23.460\n I think he believed it early on.\n\n57:23.460 --> 57:28.260\n I think he, I believe he still believes it,\n\n57:28.260 --> 57:30.500\n but I think he's deeply suspicious\n\n57:30.500 --> 57:33.140\n of the corruption that lurks in the shadows.\n\n57:33.140 --> 57:34.860\n And I do believe that,\n\n57:34.860 --> 57:38.180\n like as somebody who thinks clickbait journalism is broken,\n\n57:38.180 --> 57:40.140\n journalists annoy the hell out of me.\n\n57:40.140 --> 57:42.340\n Clickbait journalism's working perfectly.\n\n57:42.340 --> 57:43.660\n Journalism's broken.\n\n57:43.660 --> 57:44.500\n Journalism.\n\n57:44.500 --> 57:45.320\n Clickbait thing's working great.\n\n57:45.320 --> 57:46.700\n Exactly.\n\n57:46.700 --> 57:49.780\n So I understand from Putin's perspective\n\n57:49.780 --> 57:52.840\n that journalism, journalists can be seen\n\n57:52.840 --> 57:53.940\n as the enemy of the state,\n\n57:53.940 --> 57:57.800\n because people think journalists write these deep,\n\n57:57.800 --> 57:59.660\n beautiful philosophical pieces\n\n57:59.660 --> 58:02.300\n about criticizing the structure of government\n\n58:02.300 --> 58:04.740\n and the proper policy where, you know,\n\n58:04.740 --> 58:07.820\n the steps that we need to take to make a greater nation.\n\n58:07.820 --> 58:11.340\n No, they, they're unfairly take stuff out of context.\n\n58:11.340 --> 58:13.860\n They, they're critical in ways\n\n58:13.860 --> 58:16.580\n that's like shallow and not interesting.\n\n58:16.580 --> 58:19.740\n They, they call you a racist or sexist,\n\n58:19.740 --> 58:22.540\n or they make up stuff all the time.\n\n58:22.540 --> 58:25.420\n So I can put myself in the mindset of a person\n\n58:25.420 --> 58:28.420\n that thinks that it is okay to remove\n\n58:28.420 --> 58:33.420\n that kind of shallow fake news voice from the system.\n\n58:34.020 --> 58:36.900\n The problem is, of course, that is a slippery slope\n\n58:36.900 --> 58:41.080\n to then you remove all the annoying people from the system,\n\n58:41.080 --> 58:43.240\n and then you change what annoying means,\n\n58:43.240 --> 58:45.240\n which annoying starts becoming a thing\n\n58:45.240 --> 58:48.780\n that like anyone who opposes the system.\n\n58:48.780 --> 58:53.020\n I mean, I get, I get the slippery,\n\n58:53.020 --> 58:55.300\n it's obvious that it becomes a slippery slope,\n\n58:55.300 --> 58:57.220\n but I can also put myself in the mindset\n\n58:57.220 --> 58:59.340\n of the people that see it's okay\n\n58:59.340 --> 59:02.260\n to remove the liars from the system,\n\n59:02.260 --> 59:04.280\n as long as it's good for Russia.\n\n59:04.280 --> 59:06.460\n And, okay, so herein lies, and this again,\n\n59:06.460 --> 59:08.460\n the traditional American perspective,\n\n59:08.460 --> 59:11.260\n because we've had yellow, so called yellow journalism\n\n59:11.260 --> 59:12.620\n since the founding of the Republic.\n\n59:12.620 --> 59:14.220\n That's nothing new.\n\n59:14.220 --> 59:16.900\n But, but the problem then comes into play,\n\n59:16.900 --> 59:20.100\n when you remove journalists, even, you know,\n\n59:20.100 --> 59:21.260\n it's a broad brush thing,\n\n59:21.260 --> 59:24.740\n because you remove both the crappy ones who are lying,\n\n59:24.740 --> 59:26.500\n and the ones who are telling the truth too,\n\n59:26.500 --> 59:31.060\n you're left with simply the approved government journalists,\n\n59:31.060 --> 59:34.020\n right, the ones who are towing the government's line,\n\n59:34.020 --> 59:37.220\n in which case the truth as you see it\n\n59:37.220 --> 59:39.240\n is a different kind of fake news, right?\n\n59:39.240 --> 59:41.380\n It's the fake news from the government,\n\n59:41.380 --> 59:43.340\n instead of the clickbait news,\n\n59:43.340 --> 59:46.500\n and oh yeah, maybe truth mixed into all that too,\n\n59:46.500 --> 59:48.020\n in some of the outlets.\n\n59:48.020 --> 59:49.700\n The problem I always have with our system\n\n59:49.700 --> 59:50.920\n here in the United States right now\n\n59:50.920 --> 59:55.540\n is trying to tease the truth out from all the falsehoods.\n\n59:55.540 --> 59:58.660\n And look, I've got 30 years in journalism.\n\n59:58.660 --> 1:00:01.020\n My job used to be to go through, before the internet,\n\n1:00:01.020 --> 1:00:03.220\n all the newspapers, and find the,\n\n1:00:03.220 --> 1:00:05.100\n I used to know all the journalists by name,\n\n1:00:05.100 --> 1:00:06.860\n and I could pick out, you know, who they were,\n\n1:00:06.860 --> 1:00:11.020\n and I have a hard time picking out the truth\n\n1:00:11.020 --> 1:00:13.380\n from the falsehoods, so I think constantly,\n\n1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:16.460\n how are people who don't have all this background,\n\n1:00:16.460 --> 1:00:19.100\n who have lives, or who are trained in other specialties,\n\n1:00:19.100 --> 1:00:20.500\n how do they do it?\n\n1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:24.540\n But if the government is the only approved outlet for truth,\n\n1:00:25.380 --> 1:00:26.600\n a traditional American,\n\n1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:28.260\n and a lot of other traditional societies\n\n1:00:28.260 --> 1:00:29.940\n based on these ideas of the Enlightenment\n\n1:00:29.940 --> 1:00:31.220\n that I talked about earlier,\n\n1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:33.440\n would see that as a disaster waiting to happen,\n\n1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.120\n or a tyranny in progress.\n\n1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:35.960\n Does that make sense?\n\n1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:37.440\n Oh, it totally makes sense,\n\n1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:40.140\n and I would agree with you, I still agree with you,\n\n1:00:40.140 --> 1:00:43.860\n but it is clear that something about the freedom\n\n1:00:43.860 --> 1:00:47.460\n of the press and freedom of speech in today,\n\n1:00:47.460 --> 1:00:49.580\n like literally the last few years\n\n1:00:49.580 --> 1:00:52.380\n with the internet is changing,\n\n1:00:52.380 --> 1:00:53.860\n and the argument, you know,\n\n1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:55.980\n you could say that the American system\n\n1:00:55.980 --> 1:00:59.340\n of freedom of speech is broken,\n\n1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:04.160\n because the, here's the belief I grew up on,\n\n1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:07.740\n and I still hold, but I'm starting to be sort of\n\n1:01:07.740 --> 1:01:09.660\n trying to see multiple views on it.\n\n1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:14.340\n My belief was that freedom of speech results\n\n1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:18.180\n in a stable trajectory towards truth always.\n\n1:01:18.180 --> 1:01:19.900\n So like truth will emerge.\n\n1:01:19.900 --> 1:01:21.660\n That was my sort of faith and belief\n\n1:01:21.660 --> 1:01:24.820\n that yeah, there's going to be lies all over the place,\n\n1:01:24.820 --> 1:01:27.820\n but there'll be like a stable thing that is true,\n\n1:01:27.820 --> 1:01:31.620\n that's carried forward to the public.\n\n1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:36.620\n Now it feels like it's possible to go towards a world\n\n1:01:36.620 --> 1:01:39.740\n where nothing is true,\n\n1:01:39.740 --> 1:01:44.700\n where truth is something that groups of people\n\n1:01:44.700 --> 1:01:45.900\n convince themselves of,\n\n1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:48.020\n and there's multiple groups of people,\n\n1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:51.220\n and the idea of some universal truth,\n\n1:01:51.220 --> 1:01:53.220\n as I suppose is the better thing,\n\n1:01:53.220 --> 1:01:57.320\n is something that we can no longer exist under.\n\n1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:00.460\n Like some people believe that the Green Bay Packers\n\n1:02:00.460 --> 1:02:02.600\n is the best football team,\n\n1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:04.860\n and some people can think the Patriots,\n\n1:02:04.860 --> 1:02:07.940\n and they deeply believe it\n\n1:02:07.940 --> 1:02:10.260\n to where they call the other groups liars.\n\n1:02:10.260 --> 1:02:11.540\n Now that's fun for sports,\n\n1:02:11.540 --> 1:02:14.660\n that's fun for favorite flavors of ice cream,\n\n1:02:14.660 --> 1:02:17.220\n but they might believe that about science,\n\n1:02:17.220 --> 1:02:22.220\n about the various aspects of politics,\n\n1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:28.200\n various aspects of sort of different policies\n\n1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:30.660\n within the function of our government.\n\n1:02:30.660 --> 1:02:32.700\n And like, that's not just like\n\n1:02:32.700 --> 1:02:34.220\n some weird thing we'll complain about,\n\n1:02:34.220 --> 1:02:35.620\n but that'll be the nature of things,\n\n1:02:35.620 --> 1:02:38.740\n like truth is something we can no longer have.\n\n1:02:38.740 --> 1:02:41.320\n Well, and let me de romanticize\n\n1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:43.920\n the American history of this too,\n\n1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:48.920\n because the American press was often just as biased,\n\n1:02:49.100 --> 1:02:52.480\n just as, I mean, I always looked to the 1970s\n\n1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:55.740\n as the high watermark of the American journalistic,\n\n1:02:55.740 --> 1:02:57.860\n in the post Watergate era,\n\n1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:02.860\n where it was actively going after the abuses\n\n1:03:02.860 --> 1:03:04.240\n of the government and all these things.\n\n1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:06.460\n But there was a famous speech, very quiet though,\n\n1:03:06.460 --> 1:03:08.660\n very quiet, given by Katherine Graham,\n\n1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:11.400\n who was a Washington Post editor, I believe.\n\n1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:13.400\n And I actually, somebody sent it to me,\n\n1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:15.160\n we had to get it off of a journalism,\n\n1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:16.880\n like a J store kind of thing.\n\n1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:19.800\n And she, at a luncheon,\n\n1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:23.760\n assured to the government people at the luncheon,\n\n1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:25.700\n don't worry, this is not gonna be something\n\n1:03:25.700 --> 1:03:27.640\n that we make a trend.\n\n1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:31.680\n Because the position of the government\n\n1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:34.840\n is still something that was carried,\n\n1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:36.440\n that the newspapers were the water,\n\n1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:37.760\n and the newspapers were the big thing\n\n1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:40.500\n up until certainly the late 60s, early 70s.\n\n1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:42.760\n The newspapers were still the water carrier\n\n1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:43.960\n of the government, right?\n\n1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:45.680\n And they were the water carriers\n\n1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:47.740\n of the owners of the newspaper.\n\n1:03:47.740 --> 1:03:51.000\n So let's not pretend there was some angelic, wonderful time.\n\n1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.000\n And I'm saying to me,\n\n1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.680\n cause I was the one who brought it up,\n\n1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:56.860\n let's not pretend there was any super age\n\n1:03:56.860 --> 1:03:58.580\n of truthful journalism and all that.\n\n1:03:58.580 --> 1:04:01.000\n And I mean, you go to the revolutionary period\n\n1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:02.280\n in American history,\n\n1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:05.000\n and it looks every bit as bad as today, right?\n\n1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.440\n That's a hopeful message, actually.\n\n1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:09.120\n So things may not be as bad as they look.\n\n1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.180\n Well, let's look at it more like a stock market,\n\n1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:14.080\n and that you have fluctuations in the truthfulness\n\n1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:16.080\n or believability of the press.\n\n1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:18.520\n And there are periods where it was higher\n\n1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:19.920\n than other periods.\n\n1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:22.240\n The funny thing about the so called clickbait era,\n\n1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:24.260\n and I do think it's terrible,\n\n1:04:24.260 --> 1:04:27.840\n but I mean, it resembles earlier eras to me.\n\n1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:30.320\n So I always compare it to when I was a kid growing up,\n\n1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:33.840\n when I thought journalism was as good as it's ever gotten.\n\n1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:34.980\n It was never perfect.\n\n1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:39.400\n But it's also something that you see very rarely\n\n1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:41.300\n in other governments around the world.\n\n1:04:41.300 --> 1:04:42.840\n And there's a reason that journalists\n\n1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:46.600\n are often killed regularly in a lot of countries.\n\n1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:48.300\n And it's because they report on things\n\n1:04:48.300 --> 1:04:50.160\n that the authorities do not want reported on.\n\n1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:51.000\n And I've always thought that\n\n1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.960\n that was what journalism should do.\n\n1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:55.080\n But it's gotta be truthful,\n\n1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:59.080\n otherwise it's just a different kind of propaganda, right?\n\n1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:01.360\n Can we talk about Genghis Khan?\n\n1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:02.200\n Genghis Khan?\n\n1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:03.020\n Sure.\n\n1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:05.680\n By the way, is it Genghis Khan or Genghis Khan?\n\n1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:06.680\n It's not Genghis Khan.\n\n1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:09.200\n It's either Genghis Khan or Chinggis Khan.\n\n1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.240\n So let's go with Genghis Khan.\n\n1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:12.640\n That's the only thing I'll be able to say\n\n1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:15.640\n with any certain, last certain thing I'll say about it.\n\n1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:18.920\n It's like, I don't know, GIF versus GIF.\n\n1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:21.120\n I don't know if you know about those things.\n\n1:05:21.120 --> 1:05:23.800\n I don't know how it ever got started the wrong way.\n\n1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:24.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:28.840\n So first of all, your episodes on Genghis Khan\n\n1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:31.000\n for many people are the favorite.\n\n1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.520\n It's fascinating to think about events\n\n1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:36.040\n that had so much like in their ripples,\n\n1:05:36.040 --> 1:05:40.440\n had so much impact on so much of human civilization.\n\n1:05:40.440 --> 1:05:45.120\n In your view, was he an evil man?\n\n1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:47.020\n Let's go start a discussion of evil.\n\n1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:53.000\n Another way to put it is I've read he's much loved\n\n1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:56.560\n in many parts of the world like Mongolia.\n\n1:05:56.560 --> 1:05:59.200\n And I've also read arguments that say\n\n1:05:59.200 --> 1:06:02.160\n that he was quite a progressive for the time.\n\n1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:04.240\n So where do you put him?\n\n1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:08.440\n Is he a progressive or is he an evil destroyer of humans?\n\n1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:10.440\n As I often say, I'm not a historian,\n\n1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:13.580\n which is why what I try to bring\n\n1:06:13.580 --> 1:06:17.680\n to the Hardcore History podcasts are these sub themes.\n\n1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:19.400\n So each show has, and they're not,\n\n1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:21.040\n I try to kind of soft pedal them.\n\n1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.040\n So they're not always like really right in front\n\n1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:23.880\n of your face.\n\n1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:28.640\n In that episode, the soft peddling sub theme had to do\n\n1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:32.360\n with what we referred to as a historical arsonist.\n\n1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:36.200\n And it's because some historians have taken the position\n\n1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:38.600\n that sometimes, and most of this is earlier stuff,\n\n1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:40.440\n historians don't do this very much anymore,\n\n1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:43.160\n but these were the wonderful questions I grew up with\n\n1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:45.640\n that blend, it's almost the intersection\n\n1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:48.180\n between history and philosophy.\n\n1:06:48.180 --> 1:06:52.440\n And the idea was that sometimes the world has become\n\n1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:56.800\n so overwhelmed with bureaucracy or corruption\n\n1:06:56.800 --> 1:07:00.760\n or just stagnation that somebody has to come in\n\n1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.920\n or some group of people or some force has to come in\n\n1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:06.240\n and do the equivalent of a forest fire\n\n1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:08.380\n to clear out all the dead wood\n\n1:07:08.380 --> 1:07:11.040\n so that the forest itself can be rejuvenated\n\n1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:13.160\n and society can then move forward.\n\n1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:15.620\n And there's a lot of these periods where the historians\n\n1:07:15.620 --> 1:07:18.840\n of the past will portray these figures who come in\n\n1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:23.400\n and do horrific things as creating an almost service\n\n1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:25.440\n for mankind, right?\n\n1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:28.520\n Creating the foundations for a new world\n\n1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:29.880\n that will be better than the old one.\n\n1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.000\n And it's a recurring theme.\n\n1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.440\n And so this was the sub theme of the Khan's podcast,\n\n1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:36.240\n because otherwise you don't need me to tell you the story\n\n1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:37.960\n of the Mongols, but I'm gonna bring up\n\n1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:40.240\n the historical arsonist element.\n\n1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:43.560\n And, but this gets to how the Khan has been portrayed,\n\n1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:44.380\n right?\n\n1:07:44.380 --> 1:07:46.800\n If you wanna say, oh yes, he cleared out the dead wood\n\n1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:49.400\n and made for, well, then it's a positive thing.\n\n1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:52.720\n If you say, my family was in the forest fire that he set,\n\n1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:54.420\n you're not gonna see it that way.\n\n1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:58.260\n Much of what Genghis Khan is credited with\n\n1:07:58.260 --> 1:07:59.840\n on the upside, right?\n\n1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:02.800\n So things like religious toleration,\n\n1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:05.160\n and you'll say, well, he was religiously,\n\n1:08:05.160 --> 1:08:08.040\n the Mongols were religiously tolerant.\n\n1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:10.600\n And so this makes them almost like a liberal reformer\n\n1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:11.500\n kind of thing.\n\n1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:14.280\n But this needs to be seen within the context\n\n1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:17.560\n of their empire, which was very much\n\n1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:18.640\n like the Roman viewpoint,\n\n1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.640\n which is the Romans didn't care at a lot of time\n\n1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:22.720\n what your local people worshiped.\n\n1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:24.280\n They wanted stability.\n\n1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:26.880\n And if that kept stability and kept you paying taxes\n\n1:08:26.880 --> 1:08:29.440\n and didn't require the legionaries to come in,\n\n1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:31.300\n then they didn't care, right?\n\n1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:32.960\n And the Khans were the same way.\n\n1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.600\n Like they don't care what you're practicing\n\n1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:36.440\n as long as it doesn't disrupt their empire\n\n1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:37.980\n and cause them trouble.\n\n1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:39.820\n But what I always like to point out is yes,\n\n1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:42.360\n but the Khan could still come in with his representatives\n\n1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:45.240\n to your town, decide your daughter was a beautiful woman\n\n1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:47.280\n that they wanted in the Khan's concubine,\n\n1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:48.800\n and they would take them.\n\n1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:52.440\n So how liberal an empire is this, right?\n\n1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:54.720\n So many of the things that they get credit for\n\n1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.880\n as though there's some kind of nice guys\n\n1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.840\n may in another way of looking at it\n\n1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:01.760\n just be a simple mechanism of control, right?\n\n1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:04.760\n A way to keep the empire stable.\n\n1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:07.160\n They're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart.\n\n1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:09.120\n They have decided that this is the best.\n\n1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:13.360\n And I love because the Mongols were what we would call\n\n1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:15.240\n a pagan people now.\n\n1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.880\n I love the fact that they, and I think we call it,\n\n1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:19.760\n I forgot the term we used, had to do with,\n\n1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:22.360\n like they were hedging their bets religiously, right?\n\n1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:24.440\n They didn't know which God was the right one.\n\n1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:27.400\n So as long as you're all praying for the health of the Khan,\n\n1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:30.440\n we're maximizing the chances that whoever the gods are,\n\n1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:32.440\n they get the message, right?\n\n1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:34.960\n So I think it's been portrayed as something\n\n1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:36.440\n like a liberal empire.\n\n1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:40.720\n And the idea of Mongol universality\n\n1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:43.680\n is more about conquering the world.\n\n1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:44.600\n And it's like saying, you know,\n\n1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:46.680\n we're gonna bring stability to the world by conquering it.\n\n1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:48.720\n Well, what if that's Hitler, right?\n\n1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:50.160\n He could make the same case,\n\n1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:52.240\n or Hitler wasn't really the world conqueror like that\n\n1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:54.040\n because he wouldn't have been trying\n\n1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:55.640\n to make it equal for all peoples.\n\n1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:58.300\n But my point being that it kind of takes\n\n1:09:58.300 --> 1:10:01.520\n the positive moral slant out of it\n\n1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:05.120\n if their motivation wasn't a positive moral slant\n\n1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:09.720\n to the motivate, and the Mongols didn't see it that way.\n\n1:10:09.720 --> 1:10:13.140\n And I think the way that it's portrayed is like,\n\n1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:15.200\n and I always like to use this analogy,\n\n1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:17.480\n but it's like shooting an arrow\n\n1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:20.300\n and painting a bull's eye around it afterwards, right?\n\n1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:24.680\n How do we justify and make them look good in a way\n\n1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:26.120\n that they themselves probably,\n\n1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:29.780\n and listen, we don't have the Mongol point of view per se.\n\n1:10:29.780 --> 1:10:31.360\n I mean, there's something called the secret history\n\n1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:33.660\n of the Mongols, and there's things written down\n\n1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:36.160\n by Mongolian overlords through people\n\n1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:38.580\n like Persian and Chinese scribes later.\n\n1:10:38.580 --> 1:10:41.100\n We don't have their point of view,\n\n1:10:41.100 --> 1:10:44.000\n but it sure doesn't look like this was an attempt\n\n1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.820\n to create some wonderful place\n\n1:10:45.820 --> 1:10:47.560\n where everybody was living a better life\n\n1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:48.560\n than they were before.\n\n1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:53.560\n I think that's later people putting a nice rosy spin on it.\n\n1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:57.880\n But there's an aspect to it, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:59.740\n because I'm projecting sort of my idea\n\n1:10:59.740 --> 1:11:04.440\n of what it would take to conquer so much land\n\n1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:08.880\n is the ideology is emergent.\n\n1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:11.960\n So if I were to guess,\n\n1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:16.400\n the Mongols started out as exceptionally,\n\n1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:21.400\n as warriors who valued excellence in skill of killing,\n\n1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:27.280\n not even killing, but like the actual practice of war.\n\n1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.640\n And you can start out small,\n\n1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:30.320\n and you can grow and grow and grow.\n\n1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.740\n And then in order to maintain the stability\n\n1:11:32.740 --> 1:11:36.720\n of the things over which of the conquered lands,\n\n1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.260\n you developed a set of ideas with which you can,\n\n1:11:40.260 --> 1:11:43.900\n like you said, establish control, but it was emergent.\n\n1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:48.740\n And it seems like the core first principle idea\n\n1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:52.780\n of the Mongols is just to be excellent warriors.\n\n1:11:52.780 --> 1:11:55.400\n That felt to me like the starting point.\n\n1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:57.200\n It wasn't some ideology.\n\n1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.680\n Like with Hitler and Stalin,\n\n1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:03.120\n with Hitler, there was an ideology\n\n1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:06.960\n that didn't have anything to do with war underneath it.\n\n1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.240\n It was more about conquering.\n\n1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:12.920\n It feels like the Mongols started out more organically,\n\n1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:16.240\n I would say, like this phenomenon started emergently,\n\n1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:19.260\n and they were just like similar to the Native Americans\n\n1:12:19.260 --> 1:12:21.960\n with the Comanches, like the different warrior tribes\n\n1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:24.160\n that Joe Rogan's currently obsessed with,\n\n1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:28.120\n that led me to look into it more.\n\n1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:32.200\n They seem to just start out just valuing the skill\n\n1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:35.280\n of fighting whatever the tools of war they had,\n\n1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:36.460\n which were pretty primitive,\n\n1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:38.280\n but just to be the best warriors\n\n1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:40.540\n they could possibly be, make a science out of it.\n\n1:12:40.540 --> 1:12:44.560\n Is that crazy to think that there was no ideology behind it\n\n1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:45.400\n in the beginning?\n\n1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:47.280\n I'm gonna back up a second.\n\n1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.680\n I'm reminded of the line said about the Romans,\n\n1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:52.880\n that they create a wasteland and call it peace.\n\n1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:57.000\n That is, but there's a lot of conquerors like that, right?\n\n1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.560\n Where you will sit there, and listen,\n\n1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:03.160\n historians forever have, it's the famous trade offs\n\n1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:04.920\n of empire, and they'll say, well,\n\n1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:07.320\n look at the trade that they facilitated,\n\n1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:09.440\n and look at the religion, all those kinds of things,\n\n1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:13.060\n but they come at the cost of all those peoples\n\n1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:16.840\n that they conquered forcibly and by force,\n\n1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:18.560\n integrated into their empire.\n\n1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:20.720\n The one thing we need to remember about the Mongols\n\n1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:22.800\n that makes them different than, say, the Romans,\n\n1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:26.000\n and this is complex stuff and way above my pay grade,\n\n1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.320\n but I'm fascinated with it,\n\n1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:30.260\n and it's more like the Comanches that you just brought up,\n\n1:13:30.260 --> 1:13:33.800\n is that the Mongols are not a settled society, okay?\n\n1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:36.860\n They come from a nomadic tradition.\n\n1:13:36.860 --> 1:13:39.380\n Now, several generations later,\n\n1:13:39.380 --> 1:13:44.240\n when you have Kublai Khan as the emperor of China,\n\n1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:46.600\n it's beginning to be a different thing, right?\n\n1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:48.840\n And the Mongols, when their empire broke up,\n\n1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:50.880\n the ones that were in settled,\n\n1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:53.240\n the so called settled societies, right, Iran,\n\n1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:56.040\n places like that, they will become more like,\n\n1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:59.320\n over time, the rulers of those places were traditionally,\n\n1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:03.680\n and the Mongols in, say, the Khaganate of the Golden Horde,\n\n1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:06.760\n which is still in their traditional nomadic territories,\n\n1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:09.600\n will remain traditionally more Mongol,\n\n1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:12.560\n but when you start talking about who the Mongols were,\n\n1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:15.400\n I try to make a distinction.\n\n1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:19.520\n They're not some really super special people.\n\n1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:23.780\n They're just the latest confederacy in an area\n\n1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:27.680\n that saw nomadic confederacies going back\n\n1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:30.120\n to the beginning of recorded history.\n\n1:14:30.120 --> 1:14:33.640\n The Scythians, the Sarmatians, the Avars,\n\n1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:37.120\n the Huns, the Magyars, I mean, these are all the nomadic,\n\n1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:39.640\n you know, the nomads of the Eurasian steppe\n\n1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:42.880\n were huge, huge players in the history of the world\n\n1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:47.880\n until gunpowder nullified their traditional weapons system,\n\n1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:50.460\n which I've been fascinated with\n\n1:14:50.460 --> 1:14:52.580\n because their traditional weapons system\n\n1:14:52.580 --> 1:14:54.280\n is not one you could copy,\n\n1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:56.400\n because you were talking about being the greatest warriors\n\n1:14:56.400 --> 1:14:57.840\n you could be.\n\n1:14:57.840 --> 1:15:02.080\n Every warrior society I've ever seen values that.\n\n1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:05.200\n What the nomads had of the Eurasian steppe\n\n1:15:05.200 --> 1:15:10.200\n was this relationship between human beings and animals\n\n1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:12.760\n that changed the equation.\n\n1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:15.680\n It was how they rode horses.\n\n1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:18.080\n And societies like the Byzantines,\n\n1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:20.340\n which would form one flank of the steppe\n\n1:15:20.340 --> 1:15:22.580\n and then all the way on the other side you had China,\n\n1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:24.940\n and below that you had Persia,\n\n1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:27.360\n these societies would all attempt\n\n1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:30.640\n to create mounted horsemen who used archery.\n\n1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:32.160\n And they did a good job,\n\n1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:35.000\n but they were never the equals of the nomads\n\n1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.760\n because those people were literally raised in the saddle.\n\n1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:41.520\n They compared them to centaurs.\n\n1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:42.920\n The Comanches, great example,\n\n1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:47.120\n considered to be the best horse riding warriors\n\n1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:48.620\n in North America.\n\n1:15:48.620 --> 1:15:51.720\n The Comanches, I always love watching, there's paintings.\n\n1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:54.960\n George Catlin, the famous painter\n\n1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:57.840\n who painted the Comanches, illustrated it.\n\n1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:01.200\n But the Mongols and the Scythians and the Avars\n\n1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:02.840\n and all these people did it too,\n\n1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:06.680\n where they would shoot from underneath the horse's neck,\n\n1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:09.640\n hiding behind the horse the whole way.\n\n1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:12.120\n You look at a picture of somebody doing that,\n\n1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:13.440\n and it's insane.\n\n1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:15.840\n This is what the Byzantines couldn't do\n\n1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:17.460\n and the Chinese couldn't do.\n\n1:16:17.460 --> 1:16:21.680\n It was a different level of harnessing\n\n1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:23.720\n a human animal relationship\n\n1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:26.260\n that gave them a military advantage\n\n1:16:26.260 --> 1:16:28.600\n that could not be copied, right?\n\n1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:31.560\n It could be emulated, but they were never as good, right?\n\n1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:33.480\n That's why they always hired these people.\n\n1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:35.460\n They hired mercenaries from these areas\n\n1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:38.320\n because they were incomparable, right?\n\n1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:40.680\n It's the combination of people who were shooting bows\n\n1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:43.240\n and arrows from the time they were toddlers,\n\n1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:45.000\n who were riding from the time they were,\n\n1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.600\n who rode all the time.\n\n1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:49.560\n I mean, the Huns were bow legged, the Romans said,\n\n1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:50.880\n because they were never,\n\n1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:54.360\n they ate, slept, everything in the saddle.\n\n1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:57.560\n That creates something that is difficult to copy.\n\n1:16:57.560 --> 1:17:00.480\n And it gave them a military advantage.\n\n1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:02.640\n I enjoy reading actually about\n\n1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:04.880\n when that military advantage ended.\n\n1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:07.300\n So 17th and 18th century,\n\n1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:10.260\n when the Chinese on one flank and the Russians on the other\n\n1:17:10.260 --> 1:17:12.540\n are beginning to use firearms and stuff\n\n1:17:12.540 --> 1:17:17.540\n to break this military power of these various Khans.\n\n1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:20.520\n The Mongols were simply the most dominating\n\n1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:23.100\n and most successful of the Confederacies.\n\n1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:24.560\n But if you break it down,\n\n1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:28.680\n they really formed the nucleus at the top of the pyramid,\n\n1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:30.640\n of the apex of the food chain.\n\n1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:33.320\n And a lot of the people that were known as Mongols\n\n1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:37.200\n were really lots of other tribes, non Mongolian tribes,\n\n1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:38.760\n that when the Mongols conquer you,\n\n1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:40.360\n after they killed a lot of you,\n\n1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.400\n they incorporated you into their Confederacy\n\n1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:45.440\n and often made you go first.\n\n1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:46.280\n You're gonna fight somebody,\n\n1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:48.080\n we're gonna make these people go out in front\n\n1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:49.580\n and suck up all the arrows\n\n1:17:49.580 --> 1:17:51.540\n before we go in and finish the job.\n\n1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:56.040\n So to me, and I guess a fan of the Mongols would say\n\n1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:59.080\n that the difference and what made the Mongols different\n\n1:17:59.080 --> 1:18:01.240\n wasn't the weapon system or the fighting\n\n1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:03.360\n or the warriors or the armor or anything,\n\n1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:05.000\n it was Genghis Khan.\n\n1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.520\n And if you go look at the other really dangerous,\n\n1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:09.000\n from the outside world's perspective,\n\n1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:12.640\n dangerous step, nomadic Confederacies from past history\n\n1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:16.180\n was always when some great leader emerged\n\n1:18:16.180 --> 1:18:17.400\n that could unite the tribes.\n\n1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:19.320\n And you see the same thing in Native American history\n\n1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:21.140\n to a degree too.\n\n1:18:21.140 --> 1:18:24.280\n You had people like Attila, right?\n\n1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:26.280\n Or there's one called Tumen.\n\n1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:28.160\n You go back in history and these people\n\n1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:30.600\n make the history books because they caused\n\n1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:33.480\n an enormous amount of trouble for their settled neighbors\n\n1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:36.840\n that normally, I mean, Chinese Byzantine and Persian\n\n1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:39.660\n approaches to the steppe people were always the same.\n\n1:18:39.660 --> 1:18:42.000\n They would pick out tribes to be friendly with,\n\n1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:43.960\n they would give them money, gifts, hire them,\n\n1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:46.440\n and they would use them against the other tribes.\n\n1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:48.040\n And generally Byzantine,\n\n1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:50.880\n especially in Chinese diplomatic history\n\n1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:54.040\n was all about keeping these tribes separated.\n\n1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:57.480\n Don't let them form confederations of large numbers of them\n\n1:18:57.480 --> 1:18:59.280\n because then they're unstoppable.\n\n1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:01.080\n Attila was a perfect example.\n\n1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:02.840\n The Huns were another large,\n\n1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:05.520\n the Turks, another large confederacy of these people.\n\n1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:08.240\n And they were devastating when they could unite.\n\n1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:10.600\n So the diplomatic policy was don't let them.\n\n1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:12.000\n That's what made the Mongols different\n\n1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:14.000\n is Genghis Khan united them.\n\n1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.640\n And then unlike most of the tribal confederacies,\n\n1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:19.880\n they were able to hold it together for a few generations.\n\n1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:24.880\n To linger on the little thread that you started pulling\n\n1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:28.280\n on this man, Genghis Khan, that was a leader.\n\n1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:29.960\n Temujin, yeah.\n\n1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:32.280\n What do you think makes a great leader?\n\n1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:35.000\n Maybe if you have other examples throughout history\n\n1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:40.920\n and great, again, let's use that term loosely.\n\n1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:42.040\n Meaning.\n\n1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:42.880\n Now I was gonna ask for a definition.\n\n1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:46.920\n Great uniter of whether it's evil or good,\n\n1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:48.000\n it doesn't matter.\n\n1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:51.960\n Is there somebody who stands out to you,\n\n1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:56.960\n Alexander the Great talking about military or ideologies,\n\n1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:00.520\n some people bring up FDR or, I mean,\n\n1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:03.720\n you could be the founding fathers of this country,\n\n1:20:03.720 --> 1:20:08.720\n or we can go to, was he man of the century up there?\n\n1:20:09.640 --> 1:20:14.640\n Hitler of the 20th century and Stalin\n\n1:20:14.800 --> 1:20:19.320\n and these people had really amassed the amount of power\n\n1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:20.920\n that probably has never been seen\n\n1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:22.440\n in the history of the world.\n\n1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:24.720\n Is there somebody who stands out to you\n\n1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:28.720\n by way of trying to define what makes a great uniter,\n\n1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:33.080\n great leader in one man or woman, maybe in the future?\n\n1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:35.280\n It's an interesting question.\n\n1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:36.680\n And one I've thought a lot about,\n\n1:20:36.680 --> 1:20:39.080\n because let's take Alexander the Great as an example,\n\n1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:41.720\n because Alexander fascinated the world of his time,\n\n1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:44.120\n fascinated, ever since people have been fascinated\n\n1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:45.200\n with the guy.\n\n1:20:45.200 --> 1:20:49.400\n But Alexander was a hereditary monarch, right?\n\n1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:50.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:52.200\n He was handed the kingdom.\n\n1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:53.040\n Which is fascinating.\n\n1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:56.780\n Right, but he did not need to rise from nothing\n\n1:20:56.780 --> 1:20:57.760\n to get that job.\n\n1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:00.160\n In fact, he reminds me of a lot of other leaders\n\n1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:03.440\n of Frederick the Great, for example, in Prussia.\n\n1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:06.080\n These are people who inherited\n\n1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:08.620\n the greatest army of their day.\n\n1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:11.960\n Alexander, unless he was an imbecile,\n\n1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:14.760\n was going to be great no matter what,\n\n1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:17.280\n because I mean, if you inherit the Wehrmacht,\n\n1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:19.920\n you're gonna be able to do something with it, right?\n\n1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:23.720\n Alexander's father may have been greater, Philip.\n\n1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:27.640\n Philip II was the guy who literally did create\n\n1:21:27.640 --> 1:21:32.640\n a strong kingdom from a disjointed group of people\n\n1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.960\n that were continually beset by their neighbors.\n\n1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:37.680\n He's the one that reformed that army,\n\n1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:41.000\n took things that he had learned from other Greek leaders\n\n1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:42.960\n like the Theban leader at Paminondas,\n\n1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:48.400\n and then laboriously over his lifetime\n\n1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:51.000\n stabilized the frontiers, built this system.\n\n1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.640\n He lost an eye doing it.\n\n1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:55.200\n His leg was made lame.\n\n1:21:55.200 --> 1:21:58.420\n I mean, this was a man who looked like he built the empire\n\n1:21:58.420 --> 1:22:00.480\n and led from the front ranks.\n\n1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:04.680\n I mean, and then who may have been killed by his son,\n\n1:22:04.680 --> 1:22:06.800\n we don't know who assassinated Philip,\n\n1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:08.480\n but then handed the greatest army\n\n1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:10.420\n the world had ever seen to his son,\n\n1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:12.000\n who then did great things with it.\n\n1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:13.880\n You see this pattern many times.\n\n1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:17.640\n So in my mind, I'm not sure Alexander\n\n1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:20.320\n really can be that great when you compare him\n\n1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:22.320\n to people who arose from nothing.\n\n1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:24.220\n So the difference between what we would call\n\n1:22:24.220 --> 1:22:27.040\n in the United States the self made man\n\n1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.360\n or the one who inherits a fortune.\n\n1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:31.840\n There's an old line that, it's a slur,\n\n1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:33.480\n but it's about rich people.\n\n1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:37.080\n And it's like he was born on third base\n\n1:22:37.080 --> 1:22:39.480\n and thought he hit a triple, right?\n\n1:22:39.480 --> 1:22:42.880\n Philip was born at home plate and he had to hit.\n\n1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:45.200\n Alexander started on third base.\n\n1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:48.100\n And so I try to draw a distinction between them.\n\n1:22:48.100 --> 1:22:51.700\n Genghis Khan is tough because there's two traditions.\n\n1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:53.560\n The tradition that we grew up with here\n\n1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:55.340\n in the United States and that I grew up learning\n\n1:22:55.340 --> 1:22:57.800\n was that he was a self made man.\n\n1:22:57.800 --> 1:22:59.240\n But there is a tradition,\n\n1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:01.920\n and it may be one of those things that's put after the fact\n\n1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:05.720\n because a long time ago, whether or not you had blue blood\n\n1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:08.840\n in your veins was an important distinction.\n\n1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:10.620\n And so the distinction that you'll often hear\n\n1:23:10.620 --> 1:23:14.580\n from Mongolian history is that this was a nobleman\n\n1:23:14.580 --> 1:23:16.640\n who had been deprived of his inheritance.\n\n1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:18.720\n So he was a blue blood anyway.\n\n1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:20.660\n I don't know which is true.\n\n1:23:20.660 --> 1:23:22.960\n There's certainly, I mean, when you look at a Genghis Khan,\n\n1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:26.720\n you have to go, that is a wicked amount of things\n\n1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:28.320\n to have achieved.\n\n1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:30.200\n He's very impressive as a figure.\n\n1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:32.200\n Attila is very impressive as a figure.\n\n1:23:33.600 --> 1:23:35.120\n Hitler's an interesting figure.\n\n1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:36.800\n He's one of those people,\n\n1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:38.600\n you know, the more you study about Hitler,\n\n1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:43.200\n the more you wonder where the defining moment was.\n\n1:23:43.200 --> 1:23:46.040\n Because if you look at his life,\n\n1:23:46.040 --> 1:23:50.240\n I mean, Hitler was a relatively common soldier\n\n1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:51.200\n in the First World War.\n\n1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:52.240\n I mean, he was brave.\n\n1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:54.280\n He got some decorations.\n\n1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:56.040\n In fact, the highest decoration he got\n\n1:23:56.040 --> 1:23:59.660\n in the First World War was given to him by a Jewish officer.\n\n1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:03.080\n And he often didn't talk about that decoration,\n\n1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:04.760\n even though it was the more prestigious one\n\n1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:06.320\n because it would open up a whole can of worms\n\n1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:07.720\n you didn't wanna get into.\n\n1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:11.240\n But Hitler's, I mean, if you said who was Hitler today,\n\n1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:12.660\n one of the top things you're gonna say\n\n1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:14.720\n is he was an anti Semite.\n\n1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:16.040\n Well, then you have to draw a distinction\n\n1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:19.840\n between general regular anti Semitism\n\n1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:21.640\n that was pretty common in the era\n\n1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:24.440\n and something that was a rabid level of anti Semitism.\n\n1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:27.560\n But Hitler didn't seem to show a rabid level\n\n1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:29.480\n of anti Semitism until after\n\n1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:31.560\n or at the very end of the First World War.\n\n1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:34.880\n So if this is a defining part of this person's character\n\n1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:38.320\n and much of what we consider to be his evil\n\n1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:41.440\n stems from that, what happened to this guy\n\n1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:43.200\n when he's an adult, right?\n\n1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:45.960\n He's already fought in the war to change him so.\n\n1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:47.200\n I mean, it's almost like the old,\n\n1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:48.240\n there was always a movie theme.\n\n1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:50.740\n Somebody gets hit by something on the head\n\n1:24:50.740 --> 1:24:52.840\n and their whole personality changes, right?\n\n1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:55.340\n I mean, it almost seems something like that.\n\n1:24:55.340 --> 1:24:58.840\n So I don't think I call that necessarily a great leader.\n\n1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:00.200\n To me, the interesting thing about Hitler\n\n1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:03.600\n is what the hell happened to a nondescript person\n\n1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:07.160\n who didn't really impress anybody with his skills.\n\n1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:10.440\n And then in the 1920s, it's all of a sudden,\n\n1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:12.800\n as you said, sort of the man of the hour, right?\n\n1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:14.040\n So that to me is kind of,\n\n1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.420\n I have this feeling that Genghis Khan,\n\n1:25:16.420 --> 1:25:18.000\n and we don't really know,\n\n1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.520\n was an impressive human being from the get go.\n\n1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:22.040\n And then he was raised in this environment\n\n1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:23.440\n with pressure on all sides.\n\n1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:26.000\n So you start with this diamond and then you polish it\n\n1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.720\n and you harden it his whole life.\n\n1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:31.240\n Hitler seemed to be a very unimpressive gemstone\n\n1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:33.320\n most of his life, and then all of a sudden.\n\n1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:36.800\n So, I mean, I don't think I can label great leaders.\n\n1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:39.360\n And I'm always fascinated by that idea that,\n\n1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:41.540\n and I'm trying to remember who the quote was by that,\n\n1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:43.440\n that great men, oh, Lord Acton.\n\n1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:46.360\n So great men are often not good men.\n\n1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:49.120\n And that in order to be great,\n\n1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:51.760\n you would have to jettison many of the moral qualities\n\n1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.200\n that we normally would consider a Jesus or a Gandhi,\n\n1:25:55.200 --> 1:25:58.640\n or, you know, these qualities that one looks at\n\n1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:01.160\n as the good upstanding moral qualities\n\n1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:03.460\n that we should all aspire to as examples, right?\n\n1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:05.600\n The Buddha, whatever it might be,\n\n1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:07.240\n those people wouldn't make good leaders\n\n1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:08.600\n because what you need to be a good leader\n\n1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:10.480\n often requires the kind of choices\n\n1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:14.840\n that a true philosophical diogenes moral man wouldn't make.\n\n1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:17.360\n So I don't have an answer to your question.\n\n1:26:17.360 --> 1:26:18.200\n How about that?\n\n1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:20.120\n That's a long way of saying, I don't know.\n\n1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:22.240\n Just linger a little bit.\n\n1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:24.960\n It does feel like from my study of Hitler\n\n1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:28.840\n that the time molded the man versus Genghis Khan,\n\n1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:33.600\n where it feels like he, the man molded his time.\n\n1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:34.520\n Yes, and I feel that way\n\n1:26:34.520 --> 1:26:37.840\n about a lot of those nomadic Confederacy builders,\n\n1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:41.120\n that they really seem to be these figures\n\n1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:45.760\n that stand out as extraordinary in one way or another.\n\n1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:46.600\n Remembering, by the way,\n\n1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:48.600\n that almost all the history of them were written\n\n1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.560\n by the enemies that they so mistreated\n\n1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:52.720\n that they were probably never gonna get any good press.\n\n1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:53.960\n They didn't write themselves.\n\n1:26:53.960 --> 1:26:54.800\n That's a caveat.\n\n1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:56.080\n We should always add to basically all of human history.\n\n1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.040\n Nomadic or Native American peoples\n\n1:26:58.040 --> 1:26:59.760\n or tribal peoples anywhere\n\n1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:01.440\n generally do not get the advantage\n\n1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:04.720\n of being able to write the history of their heroes.\n\n1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:08.360\n Okay, I've recently almost done\n\n1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:11.360\n with the rise and the fall of the Third Reich.\n\n1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:16.360\n It's one of the historical descriptions\n\n1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:20.600\n of Hitler's rise to power, Nazi's rise to power.\n\n1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:23.440\n There's a few philosophical things\n\n1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:27.840\n I'd like to ask you to see if you can help.\n\n1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:32.120\n Like one of the things I think about\n\n1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:37.120\n is how does one be a hero in 1930s Nazi Germany?\n\n1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:41.360\n What does it mean to be a hero?\n\n1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:44.920\n What do heroic actions look like?\n\n1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:49.920\n I think about that because I think about\n\n1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:52.760\n how I move about in this world today.\n\n1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.480\n That we live in really chaotic, intense times\n\n1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:04.320\n where I don't think you wanna draw any parallels\n\n1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:06.440\n between Nazi Germany and modern day\n\n1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:09.600\n in any of the nations we can think about.\n\n1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:12.080\n But it's not out of the realm of possibility\n\n1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:17.080\n that authoritarian governments take hold,\n\n1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:21.000\n authoritarian companies take hold.\n\n1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:24.960\n And I'd like to think that I could be\n\n1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:27.640\n in my little small way and inspire others\n\n1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.480\n to take the heroic action before things get bad.\n\n1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:36.640\n And I kind of try to place myself\n\n1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:40.000\n in what would 1930s Germany look like?\n\n1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:43.560\n Is it possible to stop a Hitler?\n\n1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:47.800\n Is it even the right way to think about it?\n\n1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:51.480\n And how does one be a hero in it?\n\n1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:53.920\n I mean, you often talk about that living through\n\n1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:55.640\n a moment in history is very different\n\n1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:57.520\n than looking at that history,\n\n1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:00.040\n looking when you look back.\n\n1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:03.920\n I also think about it, would it be possible\n\n1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:06.960\n to understand what's happening\n\n1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:11.520\n that the bells of war are ringing?\n\n1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:16.240\n It seems that most people didn't seem to understand,\n\n1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:19.800\n you know, late into the 30s that war is coming.\n\n1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:22.320\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:25.760\n On the United States side, inside Germany,\n\n1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:27.880\n like the opposing figures,\n\n1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:30.920\n the German military didn't seem to understand this.\n\n1:29:30.920 --> 1:29:34.680\n Maybe the other countries, certainly France\n\n1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:37.560\n and England didn't seem to understand this.\n\n1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:41.360\n That kind of tried to put myself into 90s, 30s Germany\n\n1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:45.360\n as I'm Jewish, which is another little twist on the whole.\n\n1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:48.120\n Like what would I do?\n\n1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:49.400\n What should one do?\n\n1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:54.400\n Do you have interesting answers?\n\n1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:56.120\n So earlier we had talked about Putin\n\n1:29:56.120 --> 1:29:57.920\n and we had talked about patriotism\n\n1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:00.680\n and love of country and those sorts of things.\n\n1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:05.680\n In order to be a hero in Nazi Germany\n\n1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:10.720\n by our views here, you would have had to have been\n\n1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:15.720\n anti patriotic to the average German's viewpoint\n\n1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:16.960\n in the 1930s, right?\n\n1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:20.000\n You would have to have opposed your own government\n\n1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:21.280\n and your own country.\n\n1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:24.160\n And that's a very, it would be a very weird thing\n\n1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:26.080\n to go to people in Germany and say,\n\n1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:28.040\n listen, the only way you're gonna be seen\n\n1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:32.080\n as a good German and a hero to the country\n\n1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:35.080\n that will be your enemies is we think\n\n1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:36.680\n you should oppose your own government.\n\n1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:40.520\n It's a strange position to put the people\n\n1:30:40.520 --> 1:30:43.240\n in a government saying you need to be against your leader,\n\n1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:45.520\n you need to oppose your government's policies,\n\n1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:47.080\n you need to oppose your government,\n\n1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:49.600\n you need to hope and work for its downfall.\n\n1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:51.160\n That doesn't sound patriotic.\n\n1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:53.360\n It wouldn't sound patriotic here in this country\n\n1:30:53.360 --> 1:30:55.080\n if you made a similar argument.\n\n1:30:55.080 --> 1:31:00.080\n I will go away from the 1930s and go to the 1940s\n\n1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:01.520\n to answer your question.\n\n1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:05.320\n So there is movements like the White Rose Movement\n\n1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:09.000\n in Germany, which involved young people really,\n\n1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.240\n and from various backgrounds, religious backgrounds often,\n\n1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:17.320\n who worked openly against the Nazi government\n\n1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:19.880\n at a time when power was already consolidated,\n\n1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:23.320\n the Gestapo was in full force and they execute people\n\n1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:24.680\n who are against the government.\n\n1:31:24.680 --> 1:31:26.400\n And these young people would go out\n\n1:31:26.400 --> 1:31:29.900\n and distribute pamphlets and many of them got their heads\n\n1:31:29.900 --> 1:31:32.700\n cut off with guillotines for their trouble.\n\n1:31:32.700 --> 1:31:35.960\n And they knew that that was gonna be the penalty.\n\n1:31:35.960 --> 1:31:40.960\n That is a remarkable amount of bravery and sacrifice\n\n1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:44.700\n and willingness to die, and almost not even willingness\n\n1:31:44.700 --> 1:31:46.020\n because they were so open about it,\n\n1:31:46.020 --> 1:31:48.120\n it's almost a certainty, right?\n\n1:31:49.620 --> 1:31:51.620\n That's incredibly moving to me.\n\n1:31:51.620 --> 1:31:53.160\n So when we talk, and we had talked earlier\n\n1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:56.000\n about sort of the human spirit and all that kind of thing,\n\n1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:01.920\n there are people in the German military who opposed\n\n1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:04.480\n and worked against Hitler, for example.\n\n1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:08.120\n But to me, that's almost cowardly compared\n\n1:32:08.120 --> 1:32:10.600\n to what these young people did in the White Rose Movement\n\n1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:13.960\n because those people in the Wehrmacht, for example,\n\n1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:16.320\n who were secretly trying to undermine Hitler,\n\n1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:18.920\n they're not really putting their lives on the line\n\n1:32:18.920 --> 1:32:20.240\n to the same degree.\n\n1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:23.760\n And so I think when I look at heroes,\n\n1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:25.360\n and listen, I remember once saying\n\n1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:28.720\n there were no conscientious objectors in Germany\n\n1:32:28.720 --> 1:32:30.680\n as a way to point out to people\n\n1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:31.600\n that you didn't have a choice,\n\n1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:32.680\n you know, you were gonna serve in there.\n\n1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:35.500\n And I got letters from Jehovah's Witnesses who said,\n\n1:32:35.500 --> 1:32:36.920\n yes, there were.\n\n1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:39.400\n And we got sent to the concentration camps.\n\n1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:42.080\n Those are remarkably brave things.\n\n1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:47.080\n It's one thing to have your own set of standards and values.\n\n1:32:47.080 --> 1:32:50.460\n It's another thing to say, oh no,\n\n1:32:50.460 --> 1:32:52.580\n I'm going to display them in a way\n\n1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:54.580\n that with this regime, that's a death sentence.\n\n1:32:54.580 --> 1:32:57.580\n And not just for me, for my family, right?\n\n1:32:57.580 --> 1:33:00.460\n In these regimes, there was not a lot of distinction made\n\n1:33:00.460 --> 1:33:02.500\n between father and son and wives.\n\n1:33:03.380 --> 1:33:05.540\n That's a remarkable sacrifice to make.\n\n1:33:05.540 --> 1:33:08.640\n And far beyond what I think I would even be capable of.\n\n1:33:08.640 --> 1:33:12.740\n And so the admiration comes from seeing people\n\n1:33:12.740 --> 1:33:16.020\n who appear to be more morally profound\n\n1:33:16.020 --> 1:33:18.040\n than you are yourself.\n\n1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:20.460\n So when I look at this, I look at that kind of thing\n\n1:33:20.460 --> 1:33:22.600\n and I just say, wow.\n\n1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:24.360\n And the funny thing is if you'd have gone\n\n1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:29.360\n to most average Germans on the street in 1942\n\n1:33:29.580 --> 1:33:31.660\n and said, what do you think of these people?\n\n1:33:31.660 --> 1:33:33.340\n They're gonna think of them as traitors\n\n1:33:33.340 --> 1:33:35.820\n who probably got what they deserved.\n\n1:33:35.820 --> 1:33:37.660\n So that's the eye of the beholder thing.\n\n1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:42.660\n It's the power of the state to sow propagandize values\n\n1:33:42.660 --> 1:33:45.960\n and morality in a way that favors the state\n\n1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:49.200\n that you can turn people who today we look at\n\n1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:51.840\n as unbelievably brave and moral\n\n1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:54.280\n and crusading for righteousness\n\n1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:56.760\n and turn them into enemies of the people.\n\n1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:00.860\n So, I mean, in my mind, it would be people like that.\n\n1:34:00.860 --> 1:34:05.520\n See, I think, so hero is a funny word\n\n1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:07.760\n and we romanticize the notion,\n\n1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:11.720\n but if I could drag you back to 1930s Germany from 1940s.\n\n1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:12.560\n Sure.\n\n1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:18.480\n I feel like the heroic actions that doesn't accomplish much\n\n1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:21.760\n is not what I'm referring to.\n\n1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:26.760\n So there's many heroes I look up to that,\n\n1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:29.200\n like David Goggins, for example,\n\n1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:31.360\n the guy who runs crazy distances.\n\n1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:35.280\n He runs for no purpose except for the suffering in itself.\n\n1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:38.880\n And I think his willingness to challenge the limits\n\n1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:42.120\n of his mind is heroic.\n\n1:34:42.120 --> 1:34:44.520\n I guess I'm looking for a different term,\n\n1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:47.880\n which is how could Hitler have been stopped?\n\n1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:52.120\n My sense is that he could have been stopped\n\n1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:56.160\n in the battle of ideas where people,\n\n1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:59.680\n millions of people were suffering economically\n\n1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:02.900\n or suffering because of the betrayal of World War I\n\n1:35:02.900 --> 1:35:04.720\n in terms of the love of country\n\n1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:07.440\n and how they felt they were being treated.\n\n1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:11.920\n And a charismatic leader that inspired love\n\n1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:15.540\n and unity that's not destructive could have emerged.\n\n1:35:15.540 --> 1:35:18.320\n And that's where the battle should have been fought.\n\n1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:22.740\n I would suggest that we need to take into account\n\n1:35:22.740 --> 1:35:26.620\n the context of the times that led to Hitler's rise of power\n\n1:35:26.620 --> 1:35:31.240\n and created the conditions where his message resonated.\n\n1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:34.760\n That is not a message that resonates at all times, right?\n\n1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:39.760\n It is impossible to understand the rise of Hitler\n\n1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:42.040\n without dealing with the First World War\n\n1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:44.020\n and the aftermath of the First World War\n\n1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:46.560\n and the inflationary terrible depression in Germany\n\n1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:50.320\n and all these things and the dissatisfaction\n\n1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:52.100\n with the Weimar Republic's government,\n\n1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:55.440\n which was often seen as something put into,\n\n1:35:55.440 --> 1:35:59.240\n which it was put into place by the victorious powers.\n\n1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:02.340\n Hitler referred to the people that signed those agreements\n\n1:36:02.340 --> 1:36:06.280\n that signed the armistice as the November criminals.\n\n1:36:06.280 --> 1:36:08.240\n And he used that as a phrase\n\n1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.080\n which resonated with the population.\n\n1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:12.800\n This was a population that was embittered.\n\n1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:14.280\n And even if they weren't embittered,\n\n1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:15.920\n the times were so terrible.\n\n1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:19.600\n And the options for operating within the system\n\n1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:24.460\n in a non radical way seemed totally discredited, right?\n\n1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:25.880\n You could work through the Weimar Republic,\n\n1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:27.640\n but they tried and it wasn't working anyway.\n\n1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:29.880\n And then the alternative to the Nazis\n\n1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:31.800\n who were bully boys in the street\n\n1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:33.480\n were communist agitators\n\n1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:36.800\n that to the average conservative Germans seem no better.\n\n1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:38.020\n So you have three options\n\n1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:39.760\n if you're an average German person.\n\n1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:42.360\n You can go with the discredited government\n\n1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:46.760\n put in power by your enemies that wasn't working anyway.\n\n1:36:46.760 --> 1:36:48.120\n You could go with the Nazis\n\n1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:49.960\n who seemed like a bunch of super patriots\n\n1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:54.120\n calling for the restoration of German authority,\n\n1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:55.720\n or you could go with the communists.\n\n1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:00.000\n And the entire thing seemed like a litany of poor options.\n\n1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.680\n And in this realm, Hitler was able to triangulate,\n\n1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:04.700\n if you will.\n\n1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.840\n He came off as a person\n\n1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:11.100\n who was going to restore German greatness\n\n1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:13.640\n at a time when this was a powerful message.\n\n1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:16.580\n But if you don't need German greatness restored,\n\n1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:18.840\n it doesn't resonate, right?\n\n1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:23.560\n So the reason that your love idea and all this stuff,\n\n1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:25.600\n I don't think would have worked in the time period\n\n1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:27.700\n is because that was not a commodity\n\n1:37:27.700 --> 1:37:30.960\n that the average German was in search of then.\n\n1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:33.760\n Well, it's interesting to think about\n\n1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:38.200\n whether greatness can be restored through mechanisms,\n\n1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:40.620\n through ideas that are not so,\n\n1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:46.740\n from our perspective today, so evil.\n\n1:37:46.740 --> 1:37:48.700\n I don't know what the right term is.\n\n1:37:48.700 --> 1:37:50.500\n But the war continued in a way.\n\n1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:52.460\n So remember that when Germany,\n\n1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:54.840\n when Hitler is rising to power,\n\n1:37:54.840 --> 1:37:58.440\n the French are in control of parts of Germany, right?\n\n1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:01.680\n The Ruhr, one of the main industrial heartlands of Germany,\n\n1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:02.920\n was occupied by the French.\n\n1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:04.500\n So there's never this point\n\n1:38:04.500 --> 1:38:07.960\n where you're allowed to let the hate dissipate, right?\n\n1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:10.440\n Every time maybe things were calming down,\n\n1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:13.120\n something else would happen to stick the knife in\n\n1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:14.280\n and twist it a little bit more,\n\n1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:16.960\n from the average German's perspective, right?\n\n1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.400\n The reparations, right?\n\n1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:20.600\n So if you say, okay, well, we're gonna get back on our feet,\n\n1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.560\n the reparations were crushing.\n\n1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:27.200\n These things prevented the idea of love or brotherhood\n\n1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:29.280\n and all these things from taking hold.\n\n1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:31.480\n And even if there were Germans who felt that way,\n\n1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:33.680\n and there most certainly were,\n\n1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:38.680\n it is hard to overcome the power of everyone else.\n\n1:38:38.760 --> 1:38:39.620\n You know, what I always say\n\n1:38:39.620 --> 1:38:41.960\n when people talk to me about humanity\n\n1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:44.520\n is I believe on individual levels,\n\n1:38:44.520 --> 1:38:46.960\n we're capable of everything and anything,\n\n1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:48.580\n good, bad, or indifferent.\n\n1:38:48.580 --> 1:38:51.280\n But collectively, it's different, right?\n\n1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:55.360\n And in the time period that we're talking about here,\n\n1:38:55.360 --> 1:38:58.100\n messages of peace on earth and love your enemies\n\n1:38:58.100 --> 1:39:00.600\n and all these sorts of things\n\n1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:03.400\n were absolutely deluged and overwhelmed\n\n1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:06.400\n and drowned out by the bitterness, the hatred,\n\n1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:07.280\n and let's be honest,\n\n1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:10.200\n the sense that you were continually being abused\n\n1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:11.760\n by your former enemies.\n\n1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:14.200\n There were a lot of people in the Allied side\n\n1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:17.560\n that realized this and said, we're setting up the next war.\n\n1:39:17.560 --> 1:39:18.960\n This is, I mean, they understood\n\n1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:20.840\n that you can only do certain things\n\n1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:23.040\n to collective human populations\n\n1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:24.320\n for a certain period of time\n\n1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:26.680\n before it is natural for them to want to.\n\n1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:29.040\n And there are, you can see German posters from the region,\n\n1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:31.680\n Nazi propaganda posters that show them\n\n1:39:31.680 --> 1:39:33.640\n breaking off the chains of their enemies.\n\n1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:35.160\n And I mean, Germany awake, right?\n\n1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:37.440\n That was the great slogan.\n\n1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:42.440\n So I think love is always a difficult option.\n\n1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.960\n And in the context of those times,\n\n1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:48.840\n it was even more disempowered than normal.\n\n1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:51.680\n Well, this goes to the,\n\n1:39:51.680 --> 1:39:54.800\n just to linger on it for a little longer,\n\n1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:58.560\n the question of the inevitability of history.\n\n1:39:59.660 --> 1:40:02.480\n Do you think Hitler could have been stopped?\n\n1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:04.840\n Do you think this kind of force that you're saying\n\n1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:07.800\n that there was a pain and it was building,\n\n1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:10.400\n there was a hatred that was building,\n\n1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:13.100\n do you think there was a way to avert?\n\n1:40:15.700 --> 1:40:17.000\n I mean, there's two questions.\n\n1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:22.000\n Could have been a lot worse and could have been better\n\n1:40:22.240 --> 1:40:25.320\n in the trajectory of history in the 30s and 40s.\n\n1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:28.000\n The most logical, see, we had started this conversation,\n\n1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.320\n it brings a wonderful bow tie into the discussion\n\n1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:32.360\n and buttons it up nicely.\n\n1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:35.640\n We had talked about force and counter force earlier.\n\n1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:38.540\n The most obvious and much discussed way\n\n1:40:38.540 --> 1:40:39.680\n that Hitler could have been stopped\n\n1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:41.320\n has nothing to do with Germans.\n\n1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:45.400\n When he remilitarized the Rhineland,\n\n1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:49.760\n everyone talks about what a couple of French divisions\n\n1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:52.340\n would have done had they simply gone in and contested.\n\n1:40:52.340 --> 1:40:54.280\n And this was something Hitler was extremely,\n\n1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:56.120\n I mean, it might've been the most nervous time\n\n1:40:56.120 --> 1:40:58.720\n in his entire career because he was afraid\n\n1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:01.000\n that they would have responded with force\n\n1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.440\n and he was in no position to do anything about it\n\n1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:04.640\n if they did.\n\n1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.240\n So this is where you get the people who say,\n\n1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:10.240\n and Churchill's one of these people too,\n\n1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:13.480\n where they talk about that he should have been stopped\n\n1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:16.720\n militarily right at the very beginning when he was weak.\n\n1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:18.120\n I don't think...\n\n1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:23.480\n Listen, there were candidates in the Catholic Center Party\n\n1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:25.520\n and others in the Weimar Republic\n\n1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:26.760\n that maybe could have done things\n\n1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:30.680\n and it's beyond my understanding of specific German history\n\n1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:32.680\n to talk about it intelligently.\n\n1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:35.840\n But I do think that had the French responded militarily\n\n1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:38.760\n to Hitler's initial moves into that area,\n\n1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:40.200\n that he would have been thwarted.\n\n1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:42.160\n And I think he himself believed,\n\n1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:44.560\n if I'm remembering my reading,\n\n1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:46.820\n that this would have led to his downfall.\n\n1:41:46.820 --> 1:41:47.960\n So the potential...\n\n1:41:47.960 --> 1:41:49.720\n See, what I don't like about this\n\n1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:52.760\n is that it almost legitimizes military intervention\n\n1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:54.280\n at a very early stage\n\n1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:56.360\n to prevent worse things from happening,\n\n1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.760\n but it might be a pretty clear cut case.\n\n1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:01.960\n But it shows we pointed out that there was a lot of sympathy\n\n1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:04.680\n on the part of the allies for the fact that\n\n1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:06.920\n the Germans probably should have Germany back\n\n1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:08.980\n and this is traditional German land.\n\n1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:11.000\n I mean, they were trying, in a funny way,\n\n1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:14.880\n it's almost like the love and the sense of justice\n\n1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:18.440\n on the allies part may have actually stayed their hand\n\n1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:20.480\n in a way that would have prevented\n\n1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:22.160\n much, much, much worse things later.\n\n1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:26.080\n But if the times were such\n\n1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:28.520\n that the message of a Hitler resonated,\n\n1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:30.900\n then simply removing Hitler from the equation\n\n1:42:30.900 --> 1:42:34.200\n would not have removed the context of the times.\n\n1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:36.680\n And that means one of two things,\n\n1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:39.120\n either you could have had another one\n\n1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:43.240\n or you could have ended up in a situation equally bad\n\n1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:44.840\n in a different direction.\n\n1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:46.260\n I don't know what that means\n\n1:42:46.260 --> 1:42:49.080\n because it's hard to imagine anything could be worse\n\n1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:52.440\n than what actually occurred, but history's funny that way.\n\n1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:55.560\n And Hitler's always everyone's favorite example\n\n1:42:55.560 --> 1:42:58.360\n of the difference between the great man theory of history\n\n1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:01.400\n and the trends and forces theories of history, right?\n\n1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:03.840\n The times made a Hitler possible\n\n1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:06.160\n and maybe even desirable to some.\n\n1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:08.640\n If you took him out of the equation,\n\n1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:12.040\n those trends and forces are still in place, right?\n\n1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:13.840\n So what does that mean?\n\n1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:16.600\n If you take him out and the door is still open,\n\n1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:19.040\n does somebody else walk through it?\n\n1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:21.960\n Yeah, it's mathematically speaking,\n\n1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:26.960\n the probability of charismatic leaders emerge.\n\n1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:32.500\n I'm so torn on that at this point.\n\n1:43:32.500 --> 1:43:33.880\n Here's another way to look at it.\n\n1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:37.840\n The institutional stability of Germany\n\n1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:41.320\n in that time period was not enough to push back.\n\n1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:43.220\n And there are other periods in German history.\n\n1:43:43.220 --> 1:43:47.720\n I mean, that Hitler arose in, arisen in 1913,\n\n1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:49.120\n he doesn't get anywhere\n\n1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:51.520\n because Germany's institutional power\n\n1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:54.400\n is enough to simply quash that.\n\n1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:57.560\n It's the fact that Germany was unstable anyway\n\n1:43:57.560 --> 1:43:59.560\n that prevented a united front\n\n1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:02.440\n that would have kept radicalism from getting out of hand.\n\n1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:03.280\n Does that make sense?\n\n1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:04.280\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:06.080\n A tricky question on this,\n\n1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:09.480\n just to stay on this a little longer\n\n1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:11.400\n because I'm not sure how to think about it,\n\n1:44:11.400 --> 1:44:15.300\n is the World War II versus the Holocaust.\n\n1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:20.640\n We were talking just now\n\n1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:23.640\n about the way that history unrolls itself\n\n1:44:23.640 --> 1:44:26.200\n and could Hitler have been stopped?\n\n1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:30.840\n And I don't quite know what to think about Hitler\n\n1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:33.080\n without the Holocaust.\n\n1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:36.440\n And perhaps in his thinking,\n\n1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:39.680\n how essential the antisemitism\n\n1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:43.180\n and the hatred of Jews was.\n\n1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:47.020\n It feels to me that,\n\n1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:50.280\n I mean, we were just talking about\n\n1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:54.520\n where did he pick up his hatred of the Jewish people?\n\n1:44:54.520 --> 1:44:57.880\n There's stories in Vienna and so on\n\n1:44:57.880 --> 1:45:02.240\n that it almost is picking up the idea\n\n1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:05.700\n of antisemitism as a really useful tool,\n\n1:45:06.900 --> 1:45:10.360\n as opposed to actually believing it in its core.\n\n1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:13.120\n Do you think World War II as it turned out\n\n1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:15.560\n and Hitler as he turned out\n\n1:45:15.560 --> 1:45:18.560\n would be possible without antisemitism?\n\n1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:21.420\n Could we have avoided the Holocaust?\n\n1:45:21.420 --> 1:45:26.200\n Or was it an integral part of the ideology\n\n1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:29.240\n of fascism and the Nazis?\n\n1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:30.760\n Not an integral part of fascism\n\n1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:32.800\n because Mussolini really, I mean,\n\n1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:34.740\n Mussolini did it to please Hitler,\n\n1:45:34.740 --> 1:45:36.800\n but it wasn't an integral part.\n\n1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:40.400\n What's interesting to me is that that's the big anomaly\n\n1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:42.940\n in the whole question because antisemitism\n\n1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:45.680\n didn't need to be a part of this at all, right?\n\n1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:50.320\n Hitler had a conspiratorial view of the world.\n\n1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:53.760\n He was a believer that the Jews controlled things, right?\n\n1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:57.600\n The Jews were responsible for both Bolshevism on one side\n\n1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:00.320\n and capitalism on the other, they ruled the banks.\n\n1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:03.680\n I mean, United States was a Jewified country, right?\n\n1:46:03.680 --> 1:46:08.680\n Bolshevism was a Jewified sort of a political.\n\n1:46:09.200 --> 1:46:11.280\n In other words, he saw Jews everywhere\n\n1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:12.320\n and he had that line about it.\n\n1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:15.920\n The Jews of Europe force another war to Germany,\n\n1:46:15.920 --> 1:46:17.360\n they'll pay the price or whatever,\n\n1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:20.280\n but then you have to believe that they're capable of that.\n\n1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:24.120\n The Holocaust is a weird, weird sidebar to the whole thing.\n\n1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:25.960\n And here's what I've always found interesting.\n\n1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:28.400\n It's a sidebar that weakened Germany\n\n1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:29.720\n because look at the First World War.\n\n1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:31.960\n The Jews fought for Germany, right?\n\n1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:33.640\n Who was the most important?\n\n1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:36.120\n And this is a very arguable point,\n\n1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:38.280\n but it's just the first one that pops into my head.\n\n1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:41.800\n Who was the most important Jewish figure\n\n1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:45.120\n that would have maybe been on the German side\n\n1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:48.360\n had the Germans had a non antisemitic?\n\n1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:49.800\n Well, listen, that whole part.\n\n1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:52.240\n Yes, it was Einstein, but the whole,\n\n1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:55.360\n I should point out that to say Germany or Europe\n\n1:46:55.360 --> 1:46:58.160\n or Russia or any of those things were not antisemitic\n\n1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:00.040\n is to do injustice to history, right?\n\n1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:04.680\n Pogroms, I mean, it's standard operating procedure.\n\n1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:06.760\n What you see in the Hitlerian era\n\n1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:09.080\n is an absolute huge spike, right?\n\n1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:11.200\n Cause the government has a conspiracy theory\n\n1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:12.080\n that the Jews have.\n\n1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:15.120\n It's funny because Hitler both thought of them as weak\n\n1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:17.240\n and super powerful at the same time, right?\n\n1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:20.400\n And as an outsider people that weakened Germany,\n\n1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:21.840\n the whole idea of the blood\n\n1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:23.440\n and how that connects to Darwinism\n\n1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:26.720\n and all that sort of stuff is just weird, right?\n\n1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:29.360\n A real outlier, but Einstein,\n\n1:47:29.360 --> 1:47:31.560\n let's just play with Einstein.\n\n1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:34.760\n If there's no antisemitism in Germany\n\n1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:38.680\n or none above the normal level, right?\n\n1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:41.680\n The baseline level, does Einstein leave\n\n1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:44.840\n along with all the other Jewish scientists?\n\n1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:49.240\n And what does Germany have as increased technological\n\n1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:52.840\n and intellectual capacity if they stay, right?\n\n1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:55.480\n It's something that actually weakened that state.\n\n1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:59.880\n It's a tragic flaw in the Hitlerian worldview,\n\n1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:03.480\n but it was so, and let me, you had mentioned earlier,\n\n1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:06.480\n like maybe it was not integral to his character.\n\n1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:09.320\n Maybe it was a wonderful tool for power.\n\n1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:10.480\n I don't think so.\n\n1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:13.920\n Somewhere along the line, and really not at the beginning,\n\n1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:17.840\n this guy became absolutely obsessed with this.\n\n1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:19.000\n With the conspiracy theory.\n\n1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:22.200\n And Jews, and he surrounded himself\n\n1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:23.880\n with people and theorists.\n\n1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:27.480\n I'm gonna use that word really, really sort of loosely,\n\n1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:28.800\n who believed this too.\n\n1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:30.920\n And so you have a cabal of people\n\n1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:33.200\n who are reinforcing this idea\n\n1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:35.200\n that the Jews control the world.\n\n1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:37.520\n He called it international jewelry\n\n1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:39.160\n was a huge part of the problem.\n\n1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:40.960\n And because of that, they deserved to be punished.\n\n1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:43.680\n They were an enemy within all these kinds of things.\n\n1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:46.420\n It's a nutty conspiracy theory\n\n1:48:46.420 --> 1:48:49.080\n that the government of one of the most,\n\n1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:51.440\n I mean, the big thing with Germany was culture, right?\n\n1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:55.720\n They were a leading figure in culture and philosophy\n\n1:48:55.720 --> 1:48:56.600\n and all these kinds of things.\n\n1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:59.520\n And that they could be overtaken\n\n1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:03.040\n with this wildly wickedly weird conspiracy theory\n\n1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:05.120\n and that it would actually determine things.\n\n1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:08.280\n I mean, Hitler was taking vast amounts of German resources\n\n1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:10.640\n and using it to wipe out this race\n\n1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:12.900\n when he needed them for all kinds of other things\n\n1:49:12.900 --> 1:49:14.640\n to fight a war of annihilation.\n\n1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:19.640\n So that is the weirdest part of the whole Nazi phenomenon.\n\n1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:24.640\n It's the darkest possible silver lining to think about\n\n1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:27.880\n is that the Holocaust may have been\n\n1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:29.920\n and the hatred of the Jewish people\n\n1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:32.600\n may have been the thing that avoided Germany\n\n1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:34.580\n getting the nuclear weapons first.\n\n1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:36.240\n And.\n\n1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:41.280\n Isn't that a wonderful historical ironic twist\n\n1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:43.920\n that if it weren't so overlaid with tragedy,\n\n1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:45.560\n a thousand years from now will be seen\n\n1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:46.760\n as something really kind of funny.\n\n1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:47.840\n Well, that's true.\n\n1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:50.640\n It's fascinating to think as you've talked.\n\n1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:52.480\n So the seeds of his own destruction, right?\n\n1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:53.560\n The tragic flaw.\n\n1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:59.760\n And my hope is, this is a discussion I have\n\n1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:01.600\n with my dad as a physicist,\n\n1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:09.400\n is that evil inherently contains with it\n\n1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:11.440\n that kind of incompetence.\n\n1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:17.400\n So my dad's discussion, so he's a physicist\n\n1:50:17.400 --> 1:50:21.440\n and an engineer, his belief is that at this time\n\n1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:24.120\n in our history, the reason we haven't had nuclear\n\n1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:29.120\n like terrorist blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere\n\n1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:32.920\n in the world is that the kind of people\n\n1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:36.880\n that would be terrorists are simply not competent enough\n\n1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:41.200\n at their job of being a destructive.\n\n1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:43.940\n So like, there's a kind of, if you plot it,\n\n1:50:43.940 --> 1:50:47.920\n the more evil you are, the less able you are.\n\n1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:52.920\n And by evil, I mean, purely just like we said,\n\n1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:56.360\n if we were to consider the hatred of Jewish people as evil,\n\n1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:58.320\n because it's sort of detached from reality,\n\n1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:02.460\n it's like just this pure hatred of something\n\n1:51:02.460 --> 1:51:07.460\n that's grounded on things, conspiracy theories.\n\n1:51:07.660 --> 1:51:11.120\n If that's evil, then the more you sell yourself,\n\n1:51:11.120 --> 1:51:13.820\n the more you give into these conspiracy theories,\n\n1:51:13.820 --> 1:51:16.880\n the less capable you are at actually engineering,\n\n1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:19.160\n which is very difficult, engineering nuclear weapons\n\n1:51:19.160 --> 1:51:20.920\n and effectively deploying them.\n\n1:51:20.920 --> 1:51:25.000\n So that's a hopeful message that the destructive people\n\n1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:30.000\n in this world are by their worldview incompetent\n\n1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:33.800\n in creating the ultimate destruction.\n\n1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:35.120\n I don't agree with that.\n\n1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:35.960\n Oh boy.\n\n1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:37.640\n I straight up don't agree with that.\n\n1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:39.200\n So why are we still here?\n\n1:51:39.200 --> 1:51:41.560\n Why haven't we destroyed ourselves?\n\n1:51:41.560 --> 1:51:45.140\n Why haven't the terrorists blown, it's been many decades.\n\n1:51:45.140 --> 1:51:49.040\n Why haven't we destroyed ourself to this point?\n\n1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:52.400\n Well, when you say it's been many decades, many decades,\n\n1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:56.800\n that's like saying in the life of 150 year old person,\n\n1:51:56.800 --> 1:51:58.880\n we've been doing well for a year.\n\n1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:01.520\n The problem with all these kinds of equations,\n\n1:52:01.520 --> 1:52:02.960\n and it was Bertrand Russell, right?\n\n1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:04.960\n The philosopher who said so.\n\n1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:09.080\n He said, it's unreasonable to expect a man to walk\n\n1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:12.040\n on a tight rope for 50 years.\n\n1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:15.560\n I mean, the problem is that this is a long game.\n\n1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:18.320\n And let's remember that up until relatively recently,\n\n1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:20.480\n what would you say, 30 years ago,\n\n1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:22.620\n the nuclear weapons in the world\n\n1:52:22.620 --> 1:52:24.360\n were really tightly controlled.\n\n1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:25.520\n That was one of the real dangers\n\n1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:26.760\n in the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:29.660\n Remember the worry that all of a sudden\n\n1:52:29.660 --> 1:52:32.600\n you were gonna have bankrupt former Soviet Republic\n\n1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:35.120\n selling nuclear weapons to terrorists and whatnot.\n\n1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:37.720\n I would suggest, and here's another problem is that\n\n1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:39.540\n when we call these terrorists evil,\n\n1:52:39.540 --> 1:52:42.060\n it's easy for an American, for example,\n\n1:52:42.060 --> 1:52:44.940\n to say that Osama bin Laden is evil.\n\n1:52:44.940 --> 1:52:46.320\n Easy for me to say that.\n\n1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:49.200\n But one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\n\n1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:52.080\n as the saying goes, and to other people, he's not.\n\n1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:54.740\n What Osama bin Laden did,\n\n1:52:54.740 --> 1:52:56.760\n and the people that worked with him,\n\n1:52:56.760 --> 1:52:58.660\n we would call evil genius.\n\n1:52:58.660 --> 1:53:00.720\n The idea of hijacking planes\n\n1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:02.640\n and flying them into the buildings like that,\n\n1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:04.720\n and that he could pull that off,\n\n1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:07.400\n and that still boggles my mind.\n\n1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:10.720\n I'm still, it's funny, I'm still stunned by that.\n\n1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:14.080\n And yet, the idea, here's the funny part,\n\n1:53:14.080 --> 1:53:16.560\n and I hesitate to talk about this\n\n1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:19.560\n because I don't wanna give anyone ideas,\n\n1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:22.720\n but you don't need nuclear weapons\n\n1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:26.320\n to do incredibly grave amounts of danger.\n\n1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:30.560\n I mean, what one can of gasoline and a BIC lighter can do\n\n1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:33.440\n in the right place and the right time,\n\n1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:36.640\n and over and over and over again\n\n1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:38.440\n can bring down societies.\n\n1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:42.120\n This is the argument behind the importance of the stability\n\n1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:44.240\n that a nation state provides.\n\n1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:48.640\n So when we went in and took out Saddam Hussein,\n\n1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:50.400\n one of the great counter arguments\n\n1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:51.560\n from some of the people who said,\n\n1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:53.600\n this is a really stupid thing to do,\n\n1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:57.300\n is that Saddam Hussein was the greatest anti terror weapon\n\n1:53:57.300 --> 1:53:59.040\n in that region that you could have\n\n1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:01.400\n because they were a threat to him.\n\n1:54:01.400 --> 1:54:03.640\n So he took that, and he did it in a way\n\n1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:07.120\n that was much more repressive than we would ever be, right?\n\n1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:08.160\n And this is the old line\n\n1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:12.480\n about why we supported right wing death squad countries,\n\n1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:14.720\n because they were taking out people\n\n1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:18.280\n that would inevitably be a problem for us if they didn't,\n\n1:54:18.280 --> 1:54:19.720\n and they were able to do it\n\n1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:21.920\n in a way we would never be able to do, supposedly.\n\n1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:23.560\n We're pretty good at that stuff,\n\n1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:25.640\n just like the Soviet Union was behind the scenes\n\n1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:27.020\n and underneath the radar.\n\n1:54:27.020 --> 1:54:29.960\n But the idea that the stability created\n\n1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:32.760\n by powerful and strong centralized leadership\n\n1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:35.920\n allowed them, it's almost like outsourcing\n\n1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:38.520\n anti terror activities, allowed them to,\n\n1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:39.680\n for their own reasons.\n\n1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:41.080\n I mean, you see the same thing\n\n1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:42.820\n in the Syria situation with the Assads.\n\n1:54:42.820 --> 1:54:46.200\n I mean, you can't have an ISIS in that area\n\n1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:48.040\n because that's a threat to the Assad government\n\n1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:49.680\n who will take care of that for you,\n\n1:54:49.680 --> 1:54:51.840\n and then that helps us by not having an ISIS.\n\n1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:56.520\n So I would suggest one, that the game is still on\n\n1:54:56.520 --> 1:54:59.000\n on whether or not these people get nuclear weapons\n\n1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:00.320\n in their hands.\n\n1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:02.080\n I would suggest they don't need them\n\n1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:03.700\n to achieve their goals, really.\n\n1:55:05.340 --> 1:55:06.840\n The crazy thing is if you start thinking\n\n1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:10.200\n like the Joker in Batman, the terrorist ideas,\n\n1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:12.000\n it's funny, I guess I would be a great terrorist\n\n1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:13.460\n because I'm just full of those ideas.\n\n1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:14.920\n Oh, you could do this, you could,\n\n1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:17.480\n it's scary to think of how vulnerable we are.\n\n1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:22.320\n But the whole point is that you as the Joker\n\n1:55:22.320 --> 1:55:24.740\n wouldn't do the terrorist actions.\n\n1:55:24.740 --> 1:55:29.280\n That's the theory that's so hopeful to me with my dad,\n\n1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:33.640\n is that all the ideas, your ability to generate good ideas,\n\n1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:37.200\n forget nuclear weapons, how you can disrupt the power grid,\n\n1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:41.040\n how you can disrupt the, attack our psychology,\n\n1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:44.960\n attack like with a can of gasoline, like you said,\n\n1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:48.060\n somehow disrupt the American system of ideas.\n\n1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:53.720\n That coming up with good ideas there.\n\n1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:55.600\n Are we saying evil people can't come up\n\n1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:57.480\n with evil genius ideas?\n\n1:55:57.480 --> 1:55:58.600\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:00.040\n We have this Hollywood story.\n\n1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:02.320\n I don't think history backs that up.\n\n1:56:02.320 --> 1:56:04.000\n I mean, I think you can say with the nuclear weapons,\n\n1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.320\n it does, but only because they're so recent.\n\n1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:10.040\n But I mean, evil genius, I mean, that's almost proverbial.\n\n1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:13.720\n But that's, okay, so to push back for the fun of it, or.\n\n1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:15.400\n And I don't mean to, I don't want you to leave this\n\n1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:17.800\n in a terrible mood because I push back\n\n1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:20.040\n on every hopeful idea you had,\n\n1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:22.360\n but I tend to be a little cynical about that stuff.\n\n1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.680\n But that goes to the definition of evil, I think,\n\n1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:29.840\n because I'm not so sure human history\n\n1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:33.440\n has a lot of evil people being competent.\n\n1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:36.600\n I do believe that they mostly,\n\n1:56:36.600 --> 1:56:38.920\n like in order to be good at doing\n\n1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:40.680\n what may be perceived as evil,\n\n1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:43.840\n you have to be able to construct an ideology\n\n1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:45.880\n around which you truly believe\n\n1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:49.040\n when you look in the mirror by yourself,\n\n1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:51.220\n that you're doing good for the world.\n\n1:56:51.220 --> 1:56:54.560\n And it's difficult to construct an ideology\n\n1:56:54.560 --> 1:56:59.000\n where destroying the lives of millions\n\n1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.120\n or disrupting the American system,\n\n1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:03.240\n I'm already contradicting myself as I'm saying.\n\n1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:05.760\n I was just gonna say, people have done this already, yes.\n\n1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.560\n So, but then it's the question of like,\n\n1:57:09.560 --> 1:57:12.560\n about aliens with the idea that\n\n1:57:16.180 --> 1:57:18.080\n if the aliens are all out there,\n\n1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:20.340\n why haven't they visited us?\n\n1:57:20.340 --> 1:57:25.000\n The same question, if it's so easy to be evil,\n\n1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.160\n not easy, if it's possible to be evil,\n\n1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:29.160\n why haven't we destroyed ourselves?\n\n1:57:29.160 --> 1:57:32.320\n And your statement is from the context of history,\n\n1:57:33.180 --> 1:57:34.840\n the game is still on.\n\n1:57:34.840 --> 1:57:37.280\n And it's just been a few years\n\n1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:40.320\n since we've found the tools to destroy ourselves.\n\n1:57:40.320 --> 1:57:44.140\n And one of the challenges of our modern time\n\n1:57:44.140 --> 1:57:46.200\n that we don't often think about this pandemic\n\n1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:49.660\n kind of revealed is how soft we've gotten\n\n1:57:49.660 --> 1:57:53.680\n in terms of our deep dependence on the system.\n\n1:57:53.680 --> 1:57:56.760\n So somebody mentioned to me,\n\n1:57:56.760 --> 1:57:59.280\n what happens if power goes out for a day?\n\n1:57:59.280 --> 1:58:04.000\n What happens if power goes out for a month?\n\n1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.040\n Oh, for example, the person that mentioned this\n\n1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:10.200\n was a Berkeley faculty that I was talking with.\n\n1:58:10.200 --> 1:58:13.440\n He's an astronomer who's observing solar flares.\n\n1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:16.960\n And it's very possible that a solar flare,\n\n1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:19.480\n they happen all the time to different degrees.\n\n1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:20.720\n To knock out your cell phones.\n\n1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:24.820\n Yeah, to knock out the power grid for months.\n\n1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:29.200\n So like, just as a thought experiment,\n\n1:58:29.200 --> 1:58:31.040\n what happens if just power goes out\n\n1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:33.720\n for a week in this country?\n\n1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:37.660\n Like the electromagnetic pulses and the nuclear weapons\n\n1:58:37.660 --> 1:58:38.920\n and all those kinds of things, yeah.\n\n1:58:38.920 --> 1:58:41.640\n But maybe that's an act of nature.\n\n1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:44.880\n And even just the act of nature will reveal\n\n1:58:46.160 --> 1:58:48.640\n like a little. The fragility of it all.\n\n1:58:48.640 --> 1:58:50.040\n And then the evil can emerge.\n\n1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:51.560\n I mean, the kind of things that might happen\n\n1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:56.200\n when power goes out, especially during a divisive time.\n\n1:58:56.200 --> 1:58:57.280\n Well, you won't have food.\n\n1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:00.420\n At baseline level, that would mean\n\n1:59:00.420 --> 1:59:04.640\n that the entire supplies chain begins to break down.\n\n1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:06.000\n And then you have desperation.\n\n1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:08.240\n And desperation opens the door to everything.\n\n1:59:09.340 --> 1:59:10.960\n Can I ask a dark question?\n\n1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:13.720\n As opposed to the other things we've been talking about?\n\n1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:16.360\n There's always a thread, a hopeful message.\n\n1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:18.400\n I think there'll be a hopeful message on this one too.\n\n1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:19.640\n You may have the wrong guess.\n\n1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:20.900\n I'm just saying.\n\n1:59:23.320 --> 1:59:26.820\n If you were to bet money on the way\n\n1:59:26.820 --> 1:59:31.000\n that human civilization destroys itself,\n\n1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:35.280\n or it collapses in some way that is,\n\n1:59:35.280 --> 1:59:38.160\n where the result would be unrecognizable to us\n\n1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:42.980\n as anything akin to progress, what would you say?\n\n1:59:42.980 --> 1:59:46.480\n Is it nuclear weapons?\n\n1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:48.840\n Is it some societal breakdown\n\n1:59:48.840 --> 1:59:51.560\n through just more traditional kinds of war?\n\n1:59:51.560 --> 1:59:54.520\n Is it engineered pandemics, nanotechnology?\n\n1:59:54.520 --> 1:59:56.600\n Is it artificial intelligence?\n\n1:59:56.600 --> 1:59:59.040\n Is it something we can't even expect yet?\n\n1:59:59.040 --> 2:00:02.680\n Do you have a sense of how we humans will destroy ourselves?\n\n2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:04.800\n Or might we live forever?\n\n2:00:04.800 --> 2:00:08.720\n I think what governs my view of this thing\n\n2:00:08.720 --> 2:00:13.240\n is the ability for us to focus ourselves collectively.\n\n2:00:13.240 --> 2:00:15.800\n And that gives me the choice of looking at this\n\n2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:19.680\n and saying, what are the odds we will do X versus Y, right?\n\n2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:24.000\n So go look at the 62 Cuban Missile Crisis,\n\n2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:28.000\n where we looked at the potential of nuclear war\n\n2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.600\n and we stared right in the face of that.\n\n2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:32.440\n To me, I consider that to be,\n\n2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:34.820\n you wanna talk about a hopeful moment?\n\n2:00:34.820 --> 2:00:36.920\n That's one of the rare times in our history\n\n2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:41.240\n where I think the odds were overwhelmingly\n\n2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:43.280\n that there would be a nuclear war.\n\n2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:46.720\n And I'm not the super Kennedy worshiper that,\n\n2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:48.360\n I grew up in an era where he was,\n\n2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:50.920\n especially amongst people in the Democratic Party,\n\n2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:52.000\n he was almost worshiped.\n\n2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.880\n And I was never that guy, but I will say something.\n\n2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:59.880\n John F. Kennedy by himself probably made decisions\n\n2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:02.760\n that saved a hundred million or more lives\n\n2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:06.400\n because everyone around him thought he should be\n\n2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:08.760\n taking the road that would have led to those deaths.\n\n2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:11.400\n And to push back against that is,\n\n2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:12.920\n when you look at it now, I mean, again,\n\n2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:13.920\n if you were a betting person,\n\n2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:15.240\n you would have bet against that.\n\n2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:16.640\n And that's rare, right?\n\n2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:22.480\n So when we talk about how the world will end,\n\n2:01:22.480 --> 2:01:26.400\n the fact that one person actually had that in their hands\n\n2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:29.120\n meant that it wasn't a collective decision.\n\n2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:30.240\n It gave, remember I said,\n\n2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:32.060\n I trust people on an individual level,\n\n2:01:32.060 --> 2:01:34.120\n but when we get together, we're more like a herd\n\n2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:36.640\n and we devolved down to the lowest common denominator.\n\n2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:40.520\n That was something where the higher ethical ideas\n\n2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:42.720\n of a single human being could come into play\n\n2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:46.320\n and make the decisions that influence the events.\n\n2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:48.760\n But when we have to act collectively,\n\n2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:50.280\n I get a lot more pessimistic.\n\n2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:53.720\n So take what we're doing to the planet.\n\n2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:56.560\n And we talk about it always now in terms of climate change,\n\n2:01:56.560 --> 2:01:59.240\n which I think is far too narrow.\n\n2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:02.720\n Look at, and I always get very frustrated\n\n2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:04.040\n when we talk about these arguments about,\n\n2:02:04.040 --> 2:02:04.880\n is it happening?\n\n2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:05.720\n Is it human?\n\n2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:09.940\n Just look at the trash, forget climate for a second.\n\n2:02:09.940 --> 2:02:12.840\n We are destroying the planet because we're not taking care\n\n2:02:12.840 --> 2:02:14.980\n of it and because what it would do to take care of it\n\n2:02:14.980 --> 2:02:17.640\n would require collective sacrifices\n\n2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:21.480\n that would require enough of us to say, okay.\n\n2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:24.640\n And we can't get enough of us to say, okay,\n\n2:02:24.640 --> 2:02:27.040\n because too many people have to be on board.\n\n2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:30.640\n It's not John F. Kennedy making one decision from one man.\n\n2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:34.720\n We have to have 85% of us or something around the world.\n\n2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:37.720\n Not just, you can't say we're gonna stop doing damage\n\n2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:41.400\n to the world here in the United States if China does it.\n\n2:02:41.400 --> 2:02:43.800\n So the amount of people that have to get on board\n\n2:02:43.800 --> 2:02:46.560\n that train is hard.\n\n2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:49.900\n You get pessimistic hoping for those kinds of shifts\n\n2:02:49.900 --> 2:02:54.040\n unless it's right, you know, Krypton's about to explode.\n\n2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:57.460\n We have, and so I think if you're talking\n\n2:02:57.460 --> 2:03:00.360\n about a gambling man's view of this,\n\n2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:02.340\n that that's gotta be the odds on favorite\n\n2:03:02.340 --> 2:03:05.320\n because it requires such a UNAM.\n\n2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:09.160\n I mean, and the systems maybe aren't even in place, right?\n\n2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:12.080\n The fact that we would need intergovernmental bodies\n\n2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:14.500\n that are completely discredited now on board\n\n2:03:14.500 --> 2:03:17.760\n and you would have to subvert the national interests\n\n2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:20.340\n of nation states, I mean, the amount of things\n\n2:03:20.340 --> 2:03:23.960\n that have to go right in a short period of time\n\n2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:27.560\n where we don't have 600 years to figure this out, right?\n\n2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:30.160\n So to me, that looks like the most likely\n\n2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:31.760\n just because the things we would have to do\n\n2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:33.640\n to avoid it seem the most unlikely.\n\n2:03:33.640 --> 2:03:34.480\n Does that make sense?\n\n2:03:34.480 --> 2:03:35.440\n Absolutely.\n\n2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:38.360\n I believe, call me naive,\n\n2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:41.400\n in just like you said with the individual,\n\n2:03:41.400 --> 2:03:43.800\n I believe that charismatic leaders,\n\n2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:46.120\n individual leaders will save us.\n\n2:03:46.120 --> 2:03:46.960\n Like this.\n\n2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:48.480\n What if you don't get them all at the same time?\n\n2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:50.520\n What if you get a charismatic leader in one country\n\n2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:52.380\n but under, or what if you get a charismatic leader\n\n2:03:52.380 --> 2:03:54.440\n in a country that doesn't really matter that much?\n\n2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:55.840\n Well, it's a ripple effect.\n\n2:03:55.840 --> 2:03:57.400\n So it starts with one leader\n\n2:03:57.400 --> 2:04:00.840\n and their charisma inspires other leaders.\n\n2:04:00.840 --> 2:04:05.160\n So it's like one ant queen steps up\n\n2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:07.280\n and then the rest of the ant starts behaving.\n\n2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:09.220\n And then there's like little other spikes\n\n2:04:09.220 --> 2:04:11.120\n of leaders that emerge.\n\n2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.080\n And then that's where collaboration emerges.\n\n2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:16.240\n I tend to believe that like when you heat up the system\n\n2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:21.040\n and shit starts getting really chaotic,\n\n2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:24.600\n then the leader, whatever this collective intelligence\n\n2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:27.980\n that we've developed, the leader will emerge.\n\n2:04:27.980 --> 2:04:28.820\n Like there.\n\n2:04:28.820 --> 2:04:30.400\n Don't you think there's just as much of a chance though\n\n2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:31.760\n that the leader would emerge and say,\n\n2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:33.960\n the Jews are the people who did all this.\n\n2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:34.800\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:36.920\n Is that the idea that they would come up,\n\n2:04:36.920 --> 2:04:37.880\n you have a charismatic leader\n\n2:04:37.880 --> 2:04:39.440\n and he's going to come up with the rights\n\n2:04:39.440 --> 2:04:41.660\n or she is going to come up with the right solution\n\n2:04:41.660 --> 2:04:45.360\n as opposed to totally coming up with the wrong solution.\n\n2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:47.580\n I mean, I guess what I'm saying is you could be right,\n\n2:04:47.580 --> 2:04:50.080\n but a lot of things have to go the right way.\n\n2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:52.880\n But my intuition about the evolutionary process\n\n2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:55.520\n that led to the creation of human intelligence\n\n2:04:55.520 --> 2:04:58.820\n and consciousness on earth results\n\n2:04:58.820 --> 2:05:02.400\n in the power of like, if we think of it,\n\n2:05:02.400 --> 2:05:05.480\n just the love in the system versus the hate in the system,\n\n2:05:05.480 --> 2:05:07.480\n that the love is greater.\n\n2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:12.480\n The human kindness potential in the system\n\n2:05:13.780 --> 2:05:18.200\n is greater than the human hatred potential.\n\n2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:21.800\n And so the leader that is in the time when it's needed,\n\n2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:25.960\n the leader that inspires love and kindness\n\n2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:30.560\n is more likely to emerge and will have more power.\n\n2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:34.160\n So you have the Hitlers of the world that emerge,\n\n2:05:34.160 --> 2:05:37.840\n but they're actually in a grand scheme of history\n\n2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:40.680\n are not that impactful.\n\n2:05:40.680 --> 2:05:42.840\n So it's weird to say,\n\n2:05:42.840 --> 2:05:45.840\n but not that many people died in World War II.\n\n2:05:45.840 --> 2:05:50.840\n If you look at the full range of human history,\n\n2:05:51.800 --> 2:05:55.680\n it's up to a hundred million, whatever that is,\n\n2:05:55.680 --> 2:05:57.000\n with natural pandemics too,\n\n2:05:57.000 --> 2:05:58.400\n you can have those kinds of numbers,\n\n2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:00.160\n but it's still a percentage.\n\n2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:01.220\n I forget what the percentage is,\n\n2:06:01.220 --> 2:06:04.600\n maybe three, 5% of the human population on earth.\n\n2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:07.160\n Maybe it's a little bit focused on a different region,\n\n2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:09.040\n but it's not destructive\n\n2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:11.840\n to the entirety of human civilization.\n\n2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:16.840\n So I believe that the charismatic leaders,\n\n2:06:17.700 --> 2:06:22.180\n when time is needed, that do good for the world\n\n2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:24.680\n in the broader sense of good\n\n2:06:24.680 --> 2:06:26.000\n are more likely to emerge\n\n2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.260\n than the ones that say, kill all the Jews.\n\n2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:32.000\n It's possible though, and this is just,\n\n2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:33.640\n I've thought about this all of 30 seconds,\n\n2:06:33.640 --> 2:06:36.160\n but I mean, it seems.\n\n2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:38.440\n We're betting money here on the 21st century,\n\n2:06:38.440 --> 2:06:39.280\n who's gonna win?\n\n2:06:39.280 --> 2:06:42.560\n I think maybe you've divided this\n\n2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:45.680\n into too much of a black and white dichotomy,\n\n2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:48.640\n this love and good on one side and this evil on another.\n\n2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:50.760\n Let me throw something that might be more\n\n2:06:50.760 --> 2:06:54.800\n in the center of that linear balancing act,\n\n2:06:54.800 --> 2:06:59.680\n self interest, which may or may not be good.\n\n2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:02.960\n The good version of it we call enlightened self interest.\n\n2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:05.920\n The bad version of it we call selfishness.\n\n2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:09.600\n But self interest to me seems like something more likely\n\n2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:13.180\n to impact the outcome than either love on one side\n\n2:07:13.180 --> 2:07:14.840\n or evil on the other.\n\n2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:17.480\n Simply a question of what's good for me\n\n2:07:17.480 --> 2:07:19.280\n or what's good for my country\n\n2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:21.120\n or what's good from my point of view\n\n2:07:21.120 --> 2:07:22.980\n or what's good for my business.\n\n2:07:22.980 --> 2:07:27.980\n I mean, if you tell me, and maybe I'm a coal miner\n\n2:07:27.980 --> 2:07:29.780\n or maybe I own a coal mine.\n\n2:07:29.780 --> 2:07:32.680\n If you say to me, we have to stop using coal\n\n2:07:32.680 --> 2:07:34.100\n because it's hurting the earth,\n\n2:07:34.100 --> 2:07:39.100\n I have a hard time disentangling that greater good question\n\n2:07:39.700 --> 2:07:43.760\n from my right now good feeding my family question, right?\n\n2:07:43.760 --> 2:07:48.280\n So I think maybe it's gonna be a much more banal thing\n\n2:07:48.280 --> 2:07:50.800\n than good and evil, much more a question\n\n2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:54.400\n of we're not all going to decide at the same time\n\n2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:57.520\n that the interests that we have are aligned.\n\n2:07:57.520 --> 2:07:58.360\n Does that make sense?\n\n2:07:58.360 --> 2:08:00.740\n Totally, but I mean, I've looked at Ayn Rand\n\n2:08:00.740 --> 2:08:02.780\n and objectivism and kind of really thought like,\n\n2:08:02.780 --> 2:08:04.480\n how bad or good can things go\n\n2:08:04.480 --> 2:08:06.640\n when everybody's acting selfishly?\n\n2:08:06.640 --> 2:08:08.880\n But I think we're just talking two aunts here\n\n2:08:08.880 --> 2:08:10.780\n with microphones talking about.\n\n2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:17.800\n But like the question is when this spreads,\n\n2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:22.800\n so what do I mean by love and kindness?\n\n2:08:23.080 --> 2:08:26.680\n I think it's human flourishing on earth\n\n2:08:26.680 --> 2:08:28.920\n and throughout the cosmos.\n\n2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:33.920\n It feels like whatever the engine that drives human beings\n\n2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:37.240\n is more likely to result in human flourishing.\n\n2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:41.240\n And people like Hitler are not good for human flourishing.\n\n2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:45.280\n So that's what I mean by good is there's a,\n\n2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:48.840\n I mean, maybe it's an intuition that kindness\n\n2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:51.600\n is an evolutionary advantage.\n\n2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:52.680\n I hate those terms.\n\n2:08:52.680 --> 2:08:55.920\n I hate to reduce stuff to evolutionary biology always,\n\n2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:58.560\n but it just seems like for us to multiply\n\n2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:03.120\n throughout the universe, it's good to be kind to each other.\n\n2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:06.880\n And those leaders will always emerge to save us\n\n2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:09.200\n from the Hitlers of the world that wanna kind of\n\n2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:11.360\n burn the thing down with a flamethrower.\n\n2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:12.280\n That's the intuition.\n\n2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:14.920\n But let's talk about, you brought up evolution several times.\n\n2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:17.080\n Let me play with that for a minute.\n\n2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:20.400\n I think going back to animal times,\n\n2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:24.360\n we are conditioned to deal with overwhelming threats\n\n2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:25.200\n right in front of us.\n\n2:09:25.200 --> 2:09:28.560\n So I have quite a bit of faith in humanity\n\n2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:33.560\n when it comes to impending doom right outside our door.\n\n2:09:33.920 --> 2:09:35.880\n If Krypton's about to explode,\n\n2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:39.880\n I think humanity can rouse themselves to great,\n\n2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:42.320\n and would give power to the people who needed it\n\n2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:44.360\n and be willing to make the sacrifices.\n\n2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:45.640\n But that's what makes, I think,\n\n2:09:45.640 --> 2:09:47.760\n the pollution slash climate change\n\n2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:51.280\n slash screwing up your environment threat\n\n2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:55.200\n so particularly insidious is it happens slowly, right?\n\n2:09:55.200 --> 2:09:58.080\n It defies fight and flight mechanisms.\n\n2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:01.080\n It defies the natural ability we have to deal\n\n2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:03.840\n with the threat that's right on top of us.\n\n2:10:03.840 --> 2:10:06.280\n And it requires an amount of foresight\n\n2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:09.160\n that while some people would be fine with that,\n\n2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:12.000\n most people are too worried and understandably,\n\n2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.840\n I think too worried about today's threat\n\n2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:18.560\n rather than next generation's threat or whatever it might be.\n\n2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:20.600\n So I mean, when we talk about when you had said,\n\n2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:23.040\n what do you think the greatest threat is?\n\n2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:24.400\n I think with nuclear weapons,\n\n2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:26.400\n I think could we have a nuclear war?\n\n2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:27.360\n We darn right could,\n\n2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:31.000\n but I think that there's enough of an inertia\n\n2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:34.800\n where against that because people understand instinctively,\n\n2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:37.680\n if I decide to launch this attack against China\n\n2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:38.960\n and I'm India,\n\n2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:41.600\n we're gonna have 50 million dead people tomorrow.\n\n2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:42.800\n Whereas if you say,\n\n2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:44.800\n we're gonna have a whole planet of dead people\n\n2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:47.520\n in three generations if we don't start now,\n\n2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:52.520\n I think the evolutionary way that we have evolved\n\n2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:55.520\n mitigates maybe against that.\n\n2:10:55.520 --> 2:10:58.440\n In other words, I think I would be pleasantly surprised\n\n2:10:58.440 --> 2:10:59.720\n if we could pull that off.\n\n2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:01.320\n Does that make sense?\n\n2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:02.160\n Totally.\n\n2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:05.280\n I don't mean to be like, I'm the sight predicting doom.\n\n2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:06.120\n It's fun that way.\n\n2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:07.480\n I think we're both,\n\n2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:09.240\n maybe I'm over the top on the love thing.\n\n2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:11.480\n Maybe I'm over the top on the doom.\n\n2:11:11.480 --> 2:11:14.560\n So it makes for a fun chat, I think.\n\n2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:17.440\n So one guy that I've talked to several times\n\n2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:22.080\n is slowly becoming a friend is a guy named Elon Musk.\n\n2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:24.720\n He's a big fan of hardcore history,\n\n2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:29.560\n especially Genghis Khan series of episodes,\n\n2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:31.240\n but really all of it,\n\n2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:34.840\n him and his girlfriend Grimes listen to it, which is.\n\n2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:35.840\n I know Elon.\n\n2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:36.720\n Yeah, you know Elon?\n\n2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:37.560\n Okay, awesome.\n\n2:11:37.560 --> 2:11:40.360\n So that's like relationship goals,\n\n2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:42.480\n like listen to hardcore history on the weekend\n\n2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:43.600\n with your loved one.\n\n2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:44.960\n Okay.\n\n2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:47.520\n So let me, if I were to look at the guy\n\n2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:51.320\n from a perspective of human history,\n\n2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:55.960\n it feels like he will be a little speck that's remembered.\n\n2:11:55.960 --> 2:11:56.920\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n2:11:56.920 --> 2:11:58.320\n You think about like the people,\n\n2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:00.960\n what will we remember from our time?\n\n2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:03.760\n Who are the people we'll remember,\n\n2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:07.840\n whether it's the Hitlers or the Einsteins,\n\n2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:09.240\n who's going to be?\n\n2:12:09.240 --> 2:12:11.560\n It's hard to predict when you're in it,\n\n2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:13.320\n but it seems like Elon\n\n2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:14.880\n will be one of those people remembered.\n\n2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:17.920\n And if I were to guess what he's remembered for,\n\n2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:20.760\n it's the work he's doing with SpaceX\n\n2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:23.800\n and potentially being the person.\n\n2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:24.800\n Now we don't know,\n\n2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:26.800\n but the being the person\n\n2:12:26.800 --> 2:12:31.800\n who launched a new era of space exploration.\n\n2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:34.280\n If we look centuries from now,\n\n2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.200\n if we are successful as human beings surviving long enough\n\n2:12:37.200 --> 2:12:42.200\n to venture out into the, you know, toward the stars.\n\n2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:44.560\n It's weird to ask you this.\n\n2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:46.480\n I don't know what your opinions are,\n\n2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:51.400\n but do you think humans will be a multi planetary species\n\n2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:53.760\n in the long arc of history?\n\n2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:56.240\n Do you think Elon will be successful in his dream?\n\n2:12:56.240 --> 2:12:59.840\n And he doesn't shy away from saying it this way, right?\n\n2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:04.680\n He really wants us to colonize Mars first\n\n2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:08.320\n and then colonize other Earth like planets\n\n2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:11.400\n in other solar systems throughout the galaxy.\n\n2:13:11.400 --> 2:13:13.560\n Do you have a hope that we humans will venture out\n\n2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:14.600\n towards the stars?\n\n2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:16.480\n So here's the thing.\n\n2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:17.960\n And this actually, again, dovetails\n\n2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:19.920\n to what we were talking about earlier.\n\n2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:24.080\n I actually, first of all, I toured SpaceX\n\n2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:27.360\n and it's hard to get your mind around\n\n2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:30.080\n because he's doing what it took governments to do before.\n\n2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:30.920\n Yes. Okay.\n\n2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:33.800\n So it's incredible that we're watching individual companies\n\n2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:34.880\n and stuff doing this.\n\n2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:35.960\n Doing it faster and cheaper.\n\n2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:38.720\n Yeah. Well, and pushing the envelope, right?\n\n2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:40.760\n Faster than the governments at the time we're moving.\n\n2:13:40.760 --> 2:13:42.440\n It really is.\n\n2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:45.240\n I mean, there's a lot of people who I think,\n\n2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:49.560\n who think Elon is overrated and you have no idea, right?\n\n2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:51.800\n When you go see it, you have no idea.\n\n2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:54.360\n But that's actually not what I'm most impressed with.\n\n2:13:55.680 --> 2:13:57.720\n It's Tesla I'm most impressed with.\n\n2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:00.560\n And the reason why is because in my mind,\n\n2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:02.920\n we just talked about what I think is the greatest threat,\n\n2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:04.160\n the environmental stuff.\n\n2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:08.280\n And I talked about our inability maybe all at the same time\n\n2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:11.600\n to be willing to sacrifice our self interests\n\n2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:13.320\n in order for the goal.\n\n2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:16.400\n And I don't wanna put words in Elon's mouth,\n\n2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:18.200\n so you can talk to him if you want to.\n\n2:14:18.200 --> 2:14:22.880\n But in my mind, what he's done is recognize that problem.\n\n2:14:22.880 --> 2:14:25.440\n And instead of building a car that's a piece of crap,\n\n2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:27.760\n but it's good for the environment so you should drive it,\n\n2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:31.880\n he's trying to create a car that if you're only motivated\n\n2:14:31.880 --> 2:14:35.240\n by your self interest, you'll buy it anyway.\n\n2:14:35.240 --> 2:14:38.080\n And it will help the environment and help us transition away\n\n2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:40.760\n from one of the main causes of damage.\n\n2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:42.960\n I mean, one of the things this pandemic\n\n2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:45.640\n and the shutdown around the world has done\n\n2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:48.040\n is show us how amazingly quickly\n\n2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:49.720\n the earth can actually rejuvenate.\n\n2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:52.040\n We're seeing clear skies in places species come\n\n2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:54.400\n and you would have thought it would have taken decades\n\n2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:55.720\n for some of this stuff.\n\n2:14:55.720 --> 2:14:59.640\n So what if to name just one major pollution source,\n\n2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:03.800\n we didn't have the pollution caused by automobiles, right?\n\n2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:06.080\n And if you had said to me, Dan,\n\n2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:08.040\n what do you think the odds of us transitioning away\n\n2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:09.480\n from that were 10 years ago,\n\n2:15:09.480 --> 2:15:10.840\n I would have said, well, people aren't gonna do it\n\n2:15:10.840 --> 2:15:12.280\n because it's inefficient, it's this, it's that,\n\n2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:15.200\n nobody wants to, but what if you created a vehicle\n\n2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:16.400\n that was superior in every way\n\n2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:19.360\n so that if you were just a self oriented consumer,\n\n2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:21.720\n you'd buy it because you wanted that car.\n\n2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:24.280\n That's the best way to get around that problem\n\n2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:28.480\n of people not wanting to, I think he's identified that.\n\n2:15:28.480 --> 2:15:30.720\n And as he's told me before,\n\n2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:33.200\n when the last time a car company was created\n\n2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:36.520\n that actually, blah, blah, blah, he's right.\n\n2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:39.280\n And so I happen to feel that even though he's pushing\n\n2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:40.760\n the envelope on the space thing,\n\n2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:43.640\n I think somebody else would have done that someday.\n\n2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:46.640\n I'm not sure because of the various things he's mentioned,\n\n2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:48.200\n how difficult it is to start there,\n\n2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:51.120\n I'm not sure that the industries that create vehicles\n\n2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:55.160\n for us would have gone where he's going to lead them\n\n2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:57.960\n if he didn't force them there through consumer demand\n\n2:15:57.960 --> 2:16:00.560\n by making a better car that people wanted anyway.\n\n2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:03.840\n They'll follow, they'll copy, they'll do all those things.\n\n2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:06.640\n And yet who was gonna do that?\n\n2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:08.760\n So I hope he doesn't hate me for saying this,\n\n2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:10.860\n but I happen to think the Tesla idea\n\n2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:15.080\n may alleviate some of the need to get off this planet\n\n2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:17.040\n because the planet's being destroyed, right?\n\n2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:19.260\n And we're gonna colonize Mars probably anyway\n\n2:16:19.260 --> 2:16:20.600\n if we live long enough.\n\n2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:23.820\n And I think the Tesla idea, not just Elon's version,\n\n2:16:23.820 --> 2:16:25.800\n but ones that follow from other people\n\n2:16:25.800 --> 2:16:28.400\n is the best chance of making sure we're around long enough\n\n2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:29.520\n to see Mars colonized.\n\n2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:30.360\n Does that make sense?\n\n2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:31.200\n Yeah, totally.\n\n2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:33.240\n And one other thing from my perspective,\n\n2:16:33.240 --> 2:16:35.320\n because I'm now starting a company,\n\n2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:38.760\n I think the interesting thing about Elon\n\n2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:43.640\n is he serves as a beacon of hope, like pragmatically speaking\n\n2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:45.640\n for people that, sort of to push back\n\n2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:48.580\n on our Doom conversation from earlier,\n\n2:16:48.580 --> 2:16:53.580\n that a single individual could build something\n\n2:16:53.580 --> 2:16:57.940\n that allows us as self interested individuals\n\n2:16:57.940 --> 2:17:00.220\n to gather together in a collective way\n\n2:17:00.220 --> 2:17:02.660\n to actually alleviate some of the dangers\n\n2:17:02.660 --> 2:17:04.820\n that face our world.\n\n2:17:04.820 --> 2:17:08.540\n So it gives me hope as an individual\n\n2:17:08.540 --> 2:17:13.540\n that I can build something that can actually have impact\n\n2:17:13.780 --> 2:17:18.780\n that counteracts the Stalins and the Hitlers\n\n2:17:18.780 --> 2:17:23.780\n and all the threats that face that human civilization faces,\n\n2:17:24.100 --> 2:17:26.020\n that an individual has that power.\n\n2:17:26.020 --> 2:17:29.220\n I didn't believe that the individual has that power\n\n2:17:29.220 --> 2:17:32.060\n in the halls of government.\n\n2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:34.980\n Like, I don't feel like any one presidential candidate\n\n2:17:34.980 --> 2:17:38.460\n can rise up and help the world, unite the world.\n\n2:17:38.460 --> 2:17:41.500\n It feels like from everything I've seen\n\n2:17:41.500 --> 2:17:44.020\n and you're right with Tesla,\n\n2:17:44.020 --> 2:17:49.020\n it can bring the world together to do good.\n\n2:17:49.300 --> 2:17:50.820\n That's a really powerful mechanism\n\n2:17:50.820 --> 2:17:53.140\n of whatever you say about capitalism,\n\n2:17:53.140 --> 2:17:58.100\n that you can build companies that start,\n\n2:17:58.100 --> 2:17:59.340\n it starts with a single individual.\n\n2:17:59.340 --> 2:18:02.640\n Of course, there's a collective that grows around that,\n\n2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:05.020\n but the leadership of a single individual,\n\n2:18:05.020 --> 2:18:08.100\n their ideas, their dreams, their vision\n\n2:18:08.100 --> 2:18:12.560\n can catalyze something that takes over the world\n\n2:18:12.560 --> 2:18:14.580\n and does good for the entire world.\n\n2:18:14.580 --> 2:18:18.220\n But if I think, but again, I think the genius of the idea\n\n2:18:18.220 --> 2:18:20.180\n is that it doesn't require us\n\n2:18:20.180 --> 2:18:23.140\n to go head to head with human nature, right?\n\n2:18:23.140 --> 2:18:27.580\n He's actually built human nature into the idea\n\n2:18:27.580 --> 2:18:29.420\n by basically saying, I'm not asking you\n\n2:18:29.420 --> 2:18:31.700\n to be an environmental activist.\n\n2:18:31.700 --> 2:18:33.940\n I'm not asking you to sacrifice to make it.\n\n2:18:33.940 --> 2:18:36.540\n I'm gonna sell you a car you're going to like better.\n\n2:18:36.540 --> 2:18:38.740\n And by buying it, you'll help the environment.\n\n2:18:38.740 --> 2:18:42.420\n That takes into account our foibles as a species\n\n2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:46.460\n and actually leverages that to work for the greater good.\n\n2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:49.300\n And that's the sort of thing that does turn off\n\n2:18:49.300 --> 2:18:51.940\n my little doom caster cynicism thing a little bit\n\n2:18:51.940 --> 2:18:55.020\n because you're actually hitting us where we live, right?\n\n2:18:55.020 --> 2:18:57.280\n You're not, you can take somebody\n\n2:18:57.280 --> 2:18:59.500\n who doesn't even believe the environment's a problem,\n\n2:18:59.500 --> 2:19:00.500\n but they want a Tesla.\n\n2:19:00.500 --> 2:19:03.140\n So they're inadvertently helping anyway.\n\n2:19:03.140 --> 2:19:05.820\n I think that's the genius of the idea.\n\n2:19:05.820 --> 2:19:09.540\n Yeah, and I'm telling you, that's one way to make love\n\n2:19:09.540 --> 2:19:13.580\n a much more efficient mechanism of change than hate.\n\n2:19:13.580 --> 2:19:15.140\n Making it in your self interest to love somebody.\n\n2:19:15.140 --> 2:19:17.620\n Making it in your self interest, creating a product\n\n2:19:17.620 --> 2:19:21.140\n that leads to more love than hate.\n\n2:19:21.140 --> 2:19:22.380\n You're gonna wanna love your neighbor\n\n2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:23.500\n because you're gonna make a fortune.\n\n2:19:23.500 --> 2:19:24.340\n Exactly.\n\n2:19:24.340 --> 2:19:25.160\n Right, okay, I get it.\n\n2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:26.000\n There you go.\n\n2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:26.820\n That's why he said.\n\n2:19:26.820 --> 2:19:27.660\n All right, I'm on board.\n\n2:19:27.660 --> 2:19:29.820\n That's why Elon said love is the answer.\n\n2:19:29.820 --> 2:19:33.100\n That's, I think, exactly what he meant.\n\n2:19:33.100 --> 2:19:35.680\n Okay, let's try something difficult.\n\n2:19:35.680 --> 2:19:40.680\n You've recorded an episode of Steering Into the Iceberg\n\n2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:43.640\n on your Common Sense program.\n\n2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:44.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:44.620 --> 2:19:47.120\n That has started a lot of conversations.\n\n2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:51.120\n It's quite moving, it was quite haunting.\n\n2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:52.960\n Got me a lot of angry emails.\n\n2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:53.800\n Really?\n\n2:19:53.800 --> 2:19:55.280\n Of course.\n\n2:19:55.280 --> 2:19:57.320\n I did something I haven't done in 30 years.\n\n2:19:57.320 --> 2:19:58.720\n I endorsed a political candidate\n\n2:19:58.720 --> 2:19:59.840\n from one of the two main parties\n\n2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:01.680\n and there were a lot of disillusioned people\n\n2:20:01.680 --> 2:20:02.920\n because of that.\n\n2:20:02.920 --> 2:20:05.520\n I guess I didn't hear it as an endorsement.\n\n2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:10.520\n I just heard it as the similar flavor of conversation\n\n2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:14.640\n as you have in hardcore history.\n\n2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:19.480\n It's almost the speaking about modern times\n\n2:20:19.480 --> 2:20:21.480\n in the same voice as you speak about\n\n2:20:21.480 --> 2:20:23.000\n when you talk about history.\n\n2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:27.160\n So it was just a little bit of a haunting view\n\n2:20:27.160 --> 2:20:28.380\n of the world today.\n\n2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:33.800\n I know we were just wearing our doom caster.\n\n2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:36.000\n Let me put that right back on, are you?\n\n2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:36.840\n No.\n\n2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:40.240\n I like the term doom caster.\n\n2:20:44.480 --> 2:20:46.440\n How do we get love to win?\n\n2:20:47.360 --> 2:20:49.160\n What's the way out of this?\n\n2:20:49.160 --> 2:20:54.160\n Is there some hopeful line that we can walk\n\n2:20:57.560 --> 2:21:01.440\n to avoid something, and I hate to use the terminology,\n\n2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:05.260\n but something that looks like a civil war,\n\n2:21:06.200 --> 2:21:08.620\n not necessarily a war of force,\n\n2:21:08.620 --> 2:21:13.620\n but a division to a level where it doesn't any longer feel\n\n2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:20.000\n like a United States of America with an emphasis on United.\n\n2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:21.960\n Is there a way out?\n\n2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:24.920\n I read a book a while back.\n\n2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:28.280\n I want to say George Friedman, the Stratfor guy wrote it.\n\n2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:30.080\n It was something called The Next Hundred Years,\n\n2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:31.520\n I think it was called.\n\n2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:35.380\n And I remember thinking, I didn't agree with any of it.\n\n2:21:35.380 --> 2:21:37.200\n And one of the things I think he said in the book\n\n2:21:37.200 --> 2:21:39.260\n was that the United States was going to break up.\n\n2:21:39.260 --> 2:21:40.100\n I'm going from memory here.\n\n2:21:40.100 --> 2:21:41.080\n He might not have said that at all,\n\n2:21:41.080 --> 2:21:42.600\n but something was stuck in my memory about that.\n\n2:21:42.600 --> 2:21:43.760\n And I remember thinking,\n\n2:21:45.980 --> 2:21:49.160\n but I think some of the arguments were connected\n\n2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:53.020\n to the differences that we had\n\n2:21:53.020 --> 2:21:55.760\n and the fact that those differences are being exploited.\n\n2:21:55.760 --> 2:21:57.440\n So we talked about media earlier\n\n2:21:57.440 --> 2:21:58.920\n and the lack of truth and everything.\n\n2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:03.320\n We have a media climate that is incentivized\n\n2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:08.160\n to take the wedges in our society and make them wider.\n\n2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:11.920\n And there's no countervailing force to do the opposite\n\n2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:13.340\n or to help.\n\n2:22:13.340 --> 2:22:17.600\n So there was a famous memo\n\n2:22:17.600 --> 2:22:21.000\n from a group called Project for a New American Century.\n\n2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:21.880\n And they took it down,\n\n2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:24.040\n but the Wayback Machine online still has it.\n\n2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:25.800\n And it happened before 9 11,\n\n2:22:25.800 --> 2:22:27.640\n spawned all kinds of conspiracy theories\n\n2:22:27.640 --> 2:22:30.840\n because it was saying something to the effect of,\n\n2:22:30.840 --> 2:22:32.320\n and I'm really paraphrasing here,\n\n2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:33.800\n but you know that the United States\n\n2:22:33.800 --> 2:22:36.320\n needs another Pearl Harbor type event\n\n2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:39.160\n because those galvanize a country\n\n2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:41.720\n that without those kinds of events periodically\n\n2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:45.400\n is naturally geared towards pulling itself apart.\n\n2:22:45.400 --> 2:22:47.160\n And it's those periodic events\n\n2:22:47.160 --> 2:22:49.040\n that act as the countervailing force\n\n2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:50.500\n that otherwise is not there.\n\n2:22:52.120 --> 2:22:53.720\n If that's true,\n\n2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:57.920\n then we are naturally inclined towards pulling ourselves apart.\n\n2:22:57.920 --> 2:23:01.420\n So to have a media environment\n\n2:23:01.420 --> 2:23:06.360\n that makes money off widening those divisions,\n\n2:23:06.360 --> 2:23:07.200\n which we do.\n\n2:23:07.200 --> 2:23:08.680\n I mean, I was in talk radio\n\n2:23:08.680 --> 2:23:11.120\n and it has those people,\n\n2:23:11.120 --> 2:23:12.640\n the people that used to scream at me\n\n2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:13.600\n cause I wouldn't do it.\n\n2:23:13.600 --> 2:23:15.620\n But I mean, we would have these terrible conversations\n\n2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:17.020\n after every broadcast\n\n2:23:17.020 --> 2:23:18.600\n where I'd be in there with the program director\n\n2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:21.280\n and they're yelling at me about heat.\n\n2:23:21.280 --> 2:23:22.980\n Heat was the word they create more heat.\n\n2:23:22.980 --> 2:23:24.380\n Well, what is heat, right?\n\n2:23:24.380 --> 2:23:25.800\n Heat is division, right?\n\n2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:26.640\n And they want the heat,\n\n2:23:26.640 --> 2:23:28.320\n not because they're political,\n\n2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:32.480\n they're not Republicans or Democrats either.\n\n2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:33.920\n We want listeners\n\n2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:36.000\n and we want engagement and involvement.\n\n2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:39.040\n And because of the constructs of the format,\n\n2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:40.320\n you don't have a lot of time to get it.\n\n2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:43.120\n So you can't have me giving you like on a podcast\n\n2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:44.940\n an hour and a half or two hours\n\n2:23:44.940 --> 2:23:47.000\n where we build a logical argument\n\n2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:48.680\n and you're with me the whole way,\n\n2:23:48.680 --> 2:23:51.240\n your audience is changing every 15 minutes.\n\n2:23:51.240 --> 2:23:53.680\n So whatever points you make to create interest\n\n2:23:53.680 --> 2:23:58.400\n and intrigue and engagement have to be knee jerk right now.\n\n2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:00.280\n Things, they told me once\n\n2:24:00.280 --> 2:24:01.720\n that the audience has to know\n\n2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:04.960\n where you stand on every single issue\n\n2:24:04.960 --> 2:24:07.640\n within five minutes of turning on your show.\n\n2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:09.200\n In other words, you have to be part\n\n2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:12.720\n of a linear set of political beliefs\n\n2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:15.940\n so that if you feel A about subject A,\n\n2:24:15.940 --> 2:24:18.040\n then you must feel D about subject D.\n\n2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:19.560\n And I don't even need to hear your opinion on it\n\n2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:20.640\n cause if you feel that way about A,\n\n2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:22.320\n you're gonna feel that way about D.\n\n2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:24.320\n This is a system that is designed\n\n2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:26.600\n to pull us apart for profit,\n\n2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:29.360\n but not because they wanna pull us apart, right?\n\n2:24:29.360 --> 2:24:31.480\n It's a byproduct of the profit.\n\n2:24:32.540 --> 2:24:37.540\n That's one little example of 50 examples in our society\n\n2:24:37.740 --> 2:24:39.880\n that work in that same fashion.\n\n2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:40.840\n So what that project\n\n2:24:40.840 --> 2:24:42.940\n for a new American century document was saying\n\n2:24:42.940 --> 2:24:46.520\n is that we're naturally inclined towards disunity\n\n2:24:46.520 --> 2:24:49.720\n and without things to occasionally ratchet\n\n2:24:49.720 --> 2:24:51.220\n the unity back up again,\n\n2:24:51.220 --> 2:24:53.200\n so that we can start from the baseline again\n\n2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:55.960\n and then pull ourselves apart till the next Pearl Harbor,\n\n2:24:55.960 --> 2:24:57.240\n that you'll pull yourself apart,\n\n2:24:57.240 --> 2:24:58.680\n which I think was,\n\n2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:01.160\n think that's what the George Friedman book was saying\n\n2:25:01.160 --> 2:25:03.260\n that I disagreed with so much at the time.\n\n2:25:04.380 --> 2:25:07.960\n So in answer to your question about civil wars,\n\n2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:09.740\n we can't have the same kind of civil war\n\n2:25:09.740 --> 2:25:12.000\n because we don't have a geographical division\n\n2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:13.960\n that's as clear cut as the one we had before, right?\n\n2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:16.720\n You had a basically north south line and some border states.\n\n2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:18.880\n It was set up for that kind of a split.\n\n2:25:18.880 --> 2:25:22.420\n Now we're divided within communities, within families,\n\n2:25:22.420 --> 2:25:25.980\n within gerrymandered voting districts and precincts, right?\n\n2:25:25.980 --> 2:25:28.580\n So you can't disengage.\n\n2:25:28.580 --> 2:25:30.000\n We're stuck with each other.\n\n2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:31.800\n So if there's a civil war now,\n\n2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:34.760\n for lack of a better word,\n\n2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:39.560\n what it might seem like is the late 1960s, early 1970s,\n\n2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:42.000\n where you had the bombings\n\n2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:45.800\n and let's call it domestic terrorism and things like that,\n\n2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:48.500\n because that would seem to be something\n\n2:25:48.500 --> 2:25:50.840\n that once again, you don't even need a large chunk\n\n2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:52.200\n of the country pulling apart.\n\n2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:56.040\n 10% of people who think it's the end times\n\n2:25:56.040 --> 2:25:57.000\n can do the damage.\n\n2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:59.200\n Just like we talked about terrorism before\n\n2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:01.360\n and a can of gas and a big lighter,\n\n2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:02.920\n I've lived in a bunch of places\n\n2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:04.640\n and I won't give anybody ideas\n\n2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:06.640\n where a can of gas and a big lighter\n\n2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.280\n would take a thousand houses down before you could blink.\n\n2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:11.120\n Right?\n\n2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:15.620\n That terrorist doesn't have to be from the Middle East,\n\n2:26:15.620 --> 2:26:17.640\n doesn't have to have some sort of a fundamentalist\n\n2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:18.800\n or religious agenda.\n\n2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:20.780\n It could just be somebody really pissed off\n\n2:26:20.780 --> 2:26:22.280\n about the election results.\n\n2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:25.440\n So once again, if we're playing an odds game here,\n\n2:26:25.440 --> 2:26:28.480\n everybody has to behave for this to work right.\n\n2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:30.400\n Only a few people have to misbehave\n\n2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:31.640\n for this thing to go sideways.\n\n2:26:31.640 --> 2:26:33.760\n And remember, for every action,\n\n2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:36.280\n there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:38.240\n So you don't even have to have those people\n\n2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:39.120\n doing all these things.\n\n2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:43.240\n All they have to do is start a tit for tat retribution cycle.\n\n2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:44.280\n And there's an escalation.\n\n2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:45.120\n Yes.\n\n2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:48.800\n And it creates a momentum of its own,\n\n2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:49.960\n which leads fundamentally,\n\n2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:51.800\n if you follow the chain of events down there\n\n2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:54.160\n to some form of dictatorial government\n\n2:26:54.160 --> 2:26:57.400\n as the only way to create stability, right?\n\n2:26:57.400 --> 2:26:59.480\n You want to destroy the Republic and have a dictator,\n\n2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:00.320\n that's how you do.\n\n2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:02.420\n And there are parallels to Nazi Germany,\n\n2:27:02.420 --> 2:27:05.760\n the burning of the Reichstag, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:07.840\n I'm the doom caster again, aren't I?\n\n2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:09.880\n And some of it could be manufactured\n\n2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:12.000\n by those seeking authoritarian power.\n\n2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.840\n Absolutely, like the Reichstag fire was\n\n2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:17.840\n or the Polish soldiers that fired over the border\n\n2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:20.600\n before the invasion in 1939.\n\n2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:24.560\n To fight the devil's advocate with an angel's advocate,\n\n2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:27.760\n I would say just as our conversation about Elon,\n\n2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:31.120\n it feels like individuals have power to unite us,\n\n2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:33.440\n to be that force of unity.\n\n2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:35.960\n So you mentioned the media.\n\n2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:40.860\n I think you're one of the great podcasters in history.\n\n2:27:40.860 --> 2:27:44.040\n Joe Rogan is like a long form, whatever.\n\n2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:47.800\n It's not podcasting, it's actually whatever the, yeah.\n\n2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:50.940\n Very infrequent is what it is, no matter what it is.\n\n2:27:50.940 --> 2:27:53.600\n But the basic process of it is you go deep\n\n2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:56.320\n and you stay deep and the listener stays\n\n2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:57.680\n with you for a long time.\n\n2:27:57.680 --> 2:28:01.000\n So I'm just looking at the numbers,\n\n2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:05.340\n like we're almost three hours in.\n\n2:28:05.340 --> 2:28:08.800\n And from previous episodes, I can tell you\n\n2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:12.480\n that about 300,000 people are still listening\n\n2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:15.160\n to the sound of our voice three hours in.\n\n2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:18.540\n So usually it's 300 to 500,000 people listen\n\n2:28:18.540 --> 2:28:19.380\n and they tune out.\n\n2:28:19.380 --> 2:28:20.880\n Congratulations, by the way, that's wonderful.\n\n2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:23.800\n Joe Rogan is like 10 times that.\n\n2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:28.800\n And so he has power to unite.\n\n2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:31.640\n You have power to unite.\n\n2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:34.160\n There's a few people with voices\n\n2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:36.380\n that it feels like they have power to unite.\n\n2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:41.040\n Even if you quote unquote endorse a candidate and so on,\n\n2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:46.040\n there's still, it feels to me that speaking of,\n\n2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:49.420\n I don't wanna keep saying love,\n\n2:28:49.420 --> 2:28:53.760\n but it's love and maybe unity more practically speaking\n\n2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:58.760\n that like sanity, that like respect\n\n2:28:58.940 --> 2:29:02.400\n for those you don't agree with or don't understand.\n\n2:29:04.060 --> 2:29:09.060\n So empathy, just a few voices of those can help us avoid\n\n2:29:09.060 --> 2:29:14.060\n the really importantly, not avoid the singular events,\n\n2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:17.320\n like you said, of somebody starting a fire and so on,\n\n2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:21.160\n but avoid the escalation of it.\n\n2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:26.160\n The preparedness of the populace to escalate those events,\n\n2:29:26.320 --> 2:29:31.320\n to turn a singular event and a single riot or a shooting\n\n2:29:32.760 --> 2:29:35.700\n or like even something much more dramatic than that,\n\n2:29:35.700 --> 2:29:38.580\n to turn that into something that creates\n\n2:29:38.580 --> 2:29:43.200\n like ripples that grow as opposed to ripples that fade away.\n\n2:29:43.200 --> 2:29:46.360\n And so like, I would like to put responsibility\n\n2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:51.040\n on somebody like you and on me in some small way.\n\n2:29:51.040 --> 2:29:55.720\n And Joe, being cognizant of the fact\n\n2:29:55.720 --> 2:29:58.520\n that a lot of very destructive things\n\n2:29:58.520 --> 2:29:59.880\n might happen in November.\n\n2:30:01.200 --> 2:30:05.440\n And a few voices can save us is the feeling I have.\n\n2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:07.560\n Not by saying who you should vote for\n\n2:30:07.560 --> 2:30:09.200\n or any of that kind of stuff,\n\n2:30:09.200 --> 2:30:13.680\n but really by being the voice of calm\n\n2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:18.680\n that like calms the seas from\n\n2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:22.240\n or whatever the analogy is from boiling up.\n\n2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:24.720\n Because I truly am worried about,\n\n2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:28.740\n this is the first time this year when I,\n\n2:30:30.320 --> 2:30:32.960\n I sometimes, I somehow have felt\n\n2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:35.960\n that the American project will go on forever.\n\n2:30:35.960 --> 2:30:39.540\n When I came to this country, I just believed,\n\n2:30:39.540 --> 2:30:42.340\n and I still think I'm young, but like,\n\n2:30:42.340 --> 2:30:45.040\n I have a dream of creating a company\n\n2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:47.400\n that will do a lot of good for the world.\n\n2:30:47.400 --> 2:30:51.280\n And I thought that America is the beacon of hope\n\n2:30:51.280 --> 2:30:54.280\n for the world and the ideas of freedom,\n\n2:30:54.280 --> 2:30:56.760\n but also the idea of empowering companies\n\n2:30:56.760 --> 2:30:58.800\n that can do some good for the world.\n\n2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:03.580\n And I'm just worried about this America that filled me,\n\n2:31:03.580 --> 2:31:08.160\n a kid that came from, our family came from nothing\n\n2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:11.840\n and from Russia as it was, Soviet Union as it was,\n\n2:31:11.840 --> 2:31:15.360\n to be able to do anything in this new country.\n\n2:31:15.360 --> 2:31:16.560\n I'm just worried about it.\n\n2:31:16.560 --> 2:31:18.720\n And it feels like a few people\n\n2:31:18.720 --> 2:31:21.060\n can still keep this project going.\n\n2:31:21.960 --> 2:31:25.860\n Like people like Elon, people like Joe.\n\n2:31:25.860 --> 2:31:30.860\n Is there, do you have a bit of that hope?\n\n2:31:34.140 --> 2:31:38.020\n I'm watching this experiment with social media right now.\n\n2:31:38.020 --> 2:31:38.900\n And I don't even mean social media,\n\n2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:41.220\n really expand that out to,\n\n2:31:41.220 --> 2:31:43.420\n I mean, I feel like we're all guinea pigs right now,\n\n2:31:43.420 --> 2:31:45.900\n watching, you know, I have two kids and just watching,\n\n2:31:45.900 --> 2:31:48.500\n and there's a three year space between the two of them,\n\n2:31:48.500 --> 2:31:50.620\n one's 18, the other's 15.\n\n2:31:50.620 --> 2:31:52.920\n And just, you know, when I was a kid,\n\n2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:56.520\n a person who was 18 and 15 would not be that different,\n\n2:31:56.520 --> 2:31:58.660\n just three years difference, more maturity.\n\n2:31:58.660 --> 2:32:00.120\n But their life experiences,\n\n2:32:00.120 --> 2:32:02.240\n you would easily classify those two people\n\n2:32:02.240 --> 2:32:04.760\n as being in the same generation.\n\n2:32:04.760 --> 2:32:08.280\n Now, because of the speed of technological change,\n\n2:32:08.280 --> 2:32:11.160\n there is a vast difference between my 18 year old\n\n2:32:11.160 --> 2:32:13.500\n and my 15 year old, and not in a maturity question,\n\n2:32:13.500 --> 2:32:17.220\n just in what apps they use, how they relate to each other,\n\n2:32:17.220 --> 2:32:20.100\n how they deal with their peers, their social skills,\n\n2:32:20.100 --> 2:32:22.460\n all those kinds of things where you turn around and go,\n\n2:32:22.460 --> 2:32:25.180\n this is uncharted territory, we've never been here,\n\n2:32:25.180 --> 2:32:26.200\n so it's gonna be interesting to see\n\n2:32:26.200 --> 2:32:27.360\n what effect that has on society.\n\n2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:29.900\n Now, as that relates to your question,\n\n2:32:29.900 --> 2:32:33.580\n the most upsetting part about all that\n\n2:32:33.580 --> 2:32:36.100\n is reading how people treat each other online.\n\n2:32:36.100 --> 2:32:37.600\n And you know, there's lots of theories about this,\n\n2:32:37.600 --> 2:32:40.200\n the fact that some of it is just for trolling laughs,\n\n2:32:40.200 --> 2:32:42.380\n that some of it is just people are not interacting\n\n2:32:42.380 --> 2:32:43.900\n face to face, so they feel free\n\n2:32:43.900 --> 2:32:45.400\n to treat each other that way.\n\n2:32:46.860 --> 2:32:51.460\n And I, of course, I'm trying to figure out how,\n\n2:32:51.460 --> 2:32:55.180\n if this is how we have always been as people, right?\n\n2:32:55.180 --> 2:32:57.180\n We've always been this way, but we've never had the means\n\n2:32:57.180 --> 2:32:59.840\n to post our feelings publicly about it,\n\n2:32:59.840 --> 2:33:02.700\n or if the environment and the social media\n\n2:33:02.700 --> 2:33:05.840\n and everything else has provided a change\n\n2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:08.100\n and changed us into something else.\n\n2:33:09.300 --> 2:33:13.740\n Either way, when one reads how we treat one another\n\n2:33:13.740 --> 2:33:17.660\n and the horrible things we say about one another online,\n\n2:33:17.660 --> 2:33:20.180\n which seems like it shouldn't be that big of deal,\n\n2:33:20.180 --> 2:33:23.080\n they're just words, but they have a cumulative effect.\n\n2:33:23.080 --> 2:33:27.380\n I mean, when you, I was reading Meghan Markle,\n\n2:33:27.380 --> 2:33:28.460\n who I don't know a lot about,\n\n2:33:28.460 --> 2:33:30.500\n because it's too much of the pop side of culture\n\n2:33:30.500 --> 2:33:32.420\n for me to pay lip, but I read a story the other day\n\n2:33:32.420 --> 2:33:34.980\n where she was talking about the abuse she took online\n\n2:33:34.980 --> 2:33:37.760\n and how incredibly overwhelming it was\n\n2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:40.140\n and how many people were doing it.\n\n2:33:40.140 --> 2:33:43.040\n And you think to yourself, okay, this is something\n\n2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:44.840\n that people who are in positions\n\n2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:46.620\n of what you were discussing earlier\n\n2:33:46.620 --> 2:33:48.420\n never had to deal with.\n\n2:33:48.420 --> 2:33:50.940\n Let me ask you something, and boy, this is the ultimate\n\n2:33:50.940 --> 2:33:53.860\n doomcaster thing of all time to say.\n\n2:33:53.860 --> 2:33:56.460\n When you think of historical figures\n\n2:33:56.460 --> 2:34:01.300\n that push things like love and peace\n\n2:34:01.300 --> 2:34:05.720\n and creating bridges between enemies,\n\n2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:09.180\n when you think of what happened to those people,\n\n2:34:09.180 --> 2:34:10.820\n first of all, they're very dangerous.\n\n2:34:10.820 --> 2:34:13.020\n Every society in the world has a better time,\n\n2:34:13.020 --> 2:34:15.540\n easier time dealing with violence and things like that\n\n2:34:15.540 --> 2:34:16.940\n than they do nonviolence.\n\n2:34:16.940 --> 2:34:19.380\n Nonviolence is really difficult for governments\n\n2:34:19.380 --> 2:34:20.940\n to deal with, for example.\n\n2:34:20.940 --> 2:34:25.260\n What happens to Gandhi and Jesus and Martin Luther King?\n\n2:34:25.260 --> 2:34:27.660\n And you think about all those people, right?\n\n2:34:27.660 --> 2:34:30.380\n When they're that, it's ironic, isn't it,\n\n2:34:30.380 --> 2:34:32.660\n that these people who push for peaceful solutions\n\n2:34:32.660 --> 2:34:36.920\n are so often killed, but it's because they're effective.\n\n2:34:36.920 --> 2:34:40.220\n And when they're killed, the effectiveness is diminished.\n\n2:34:40.220 --> 2:34:41.300\n Why are they killed?\n\n2:34:41.300 --> 2:34:44.140\n Because they're effective, and the only way to stop them\n\n2:34:44.140 --> 2:34:47.900\n is to eliminate them, because they're charismatic leaders\n\n2:34:47.900 --> 2:34:49.580\n who don't come around every day,\n\n2:34:49.580 --> 2:34:51.820\n and if you eliminate them from the scene,\n\n2:34:51.820 --> 2:34:54.740\n the odds are you're not gonna get another one for a while.\n\n2:34:54.740 --> 2:34:56.300\n I guess what I'm saying is the very things\n\n2:34:56.300 --> 2:34:57.980\n you're talking about, which would have the effect\n\n2:34:57.980 --> 2:34:58.880\n you think it would, right?\n\n2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:01.580\n They would destabilize systems in a way\n\n2:35:01.580 --> 2:35:03.840\n that most of us would consider positive,\n\n2:35:03.840 --> 2:35:06.860\n but those systems have a way of protecting themselves,\n\n2:35:06.860 --> 2:35:07.700\n right?\n\n2:35:07.700 --> 2:35:10.940\n And so I feel like history shows,\n\n2:35:10.940 --> 2:35:14.060\n see, history's pretty pessimistic, I think, by and large.\n\n2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:16.380\n If only because we can find so many examples\n\n2:35:16.380 --> 2:35:17.480\n that just sound pessimistic.\n\n2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:19.740\n But I feel like people who are dangerous\n\n2:35:19.740 --> 2:35:24.260\n to the way things are tend to be removed.\n\n2:35:24.260 --> 2:35:26.820\n Yes, but there's two things to say.\n\n2:35:26.820 --> 2:35:29.180\n I feel like you're right, that history,\n\n2:35:30.340 --> 2:35:35.300\n I feel like the ripples that love leaves in history\n\n2:35:35.300 --> 2:35:37.020\n are less obvious to detect,\n\n2:35:37.020 --> 2:35:39.540\n but are actually more transformational.\n\n2:35:39.540 --> 2:35:41.620\n Like in this. Well, one could make a case about,\n\n2:35:41.620 --> 2:35:44.020\n I mean, if you wanna talk about the long term value\n\n2:35:44.020 --> 2:35:45.980\n of a Jesus, a Gandhi, but yeah, yes,\n\n2:35:45.980 --> 2:35:48.260\n those people's ripples are still affecting people today.\n\n2:35:48.260 --> 2:35:49.100\n I agree with you.\n\n2:35:49.100 --> 2:35:50.780\n And that's, you feel those ripples\n\n2:35:50.780 --> 2:35:53.700\n through the general improvement of the quality of life\n\n2:35:53.700 --> 2:35:56.540\n that we see throughout the generations.\n\n2:35:56.540 --> 2:35:58.380\n Like you feel the ripples through the growth.\n\n2:35:58.380 --> 2:35:59.900\n Yeah, okay, I'll go along with you on that, okay.\n\n2:35:59.900 --> 2:36:02.380\n But I would, even if that's not true,\n\n2:36:04.460 --> 2:36:07.740\n I tend to believe that, and by the way,\n\n2:36:07.740 --> 2:36:12.140\n the company that I'm working on as a competitor\n\n2:36:12.140 --> 2:36:15.700\n is exactly attacking this, which is a competitor to Twitter.\n\n2:36:15.700 --> 2:36:17.820\n I think I can build a better Twitter as a first step.\n\n2:36:17.820 --> 2:36:18.940\n There's a long story in there.\n\n2:36:18.940 --> 2:36:21.500\n I think a three year old child could build a better,\n\n2:36:21.500 --> 2:36:22.980\n and this is not to denigrate you,\n\n2:36:22.980 --> 2:36:24.580\n I'm sure yours would be better than a three year old,\n\n2:36:24.580 --> 2:36:27.180\n but Twitter is so, and listen, Facebook too,\n\n2:36:27.180 --> 2:36:30.580\n they're really awful platforms for intellectual discussion\n\n2:36:30.580 --> 2:36:33.020\n and meaningful discussion, and I'm on it.\n\n2:36:33.020 --> 2:36:34.580\n So let me just say, I'm part of the problem.\n\n2:36:34.580 --> 2:36:36.980\n We're new to this, so it wasn't obvious at the time\n\n2:36:36.980 --> 2:36:41.020\n how to do it, it's now, and now a three year old can do it.\n\n2:36:41.020 --> 2:36:46.020\n I tend to believe that we live in a time where the tools\n\n2:36:46.140 --> 2:36:49.500\n that people that are interested in providing love,\n\n2:36:49.500 --> 2:36:54.660\n like the weapons of love are much more powerful.\n\n2:36:54.660 --> 2:36:58.340\n So like the one nice thing about technology\n\n2:36:58.340 --> 2:37:02.020\n is it allows anyone to build a company\n\n2:37:02.020 --> 2:37:04.580\n that's more powerful than any government.\n\n2:37:04.580 --> 2:37:06.620\n So that could be very destructive,\n\n2:37:06.620 --> 2:37:09.660\n but it could be also very positive.\n\n2:37:09.660 --> 2:37:12.420\n And that's, I tend to believe that somebody like Elon\n\n2:37:12.420 --> 2:37:14.100\n that wants to do good for the world,\n\n2:37:14.100 --> 2:37:16.540\n somebody like me and many like me\n\n2:37:16.540 --> 2:37:19.340\n could have more power than any one government.\n\n2:37:20.860 --> 2:37:24.460\n And by power, I mean the power to effect change,\n\n2:37:24.460 --> 2:37:25.300\n which is different from Gandhi.\n\n2:37:25.300 --> 2:37:26.140\n What do you do with government,\n\n2:37:26.140 --> 2:37:26.980\n and I don't mean to interrupt you,\n\n2:37:26.980 --> 2:37:28.700\n but I'll forget my train of thought, I'm getting old.\n\n2:37:28.700 --> 2:37:30.300\n But I mean, how do you deal with the fact\n\n2:37:30.300 --> 2:37:33.660\n that already governments who are afraid of this\n\n2:37:33.660 --> 2:37:36.220\n are walling off their own internet systems\n\n2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:40.340\n as a way to create firewalls simply to prevent you\n\n2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:42.260\n from doing what you're talking about?\n\n2:37:42.260 --> 2:37:43.900\n In other words, there's an old line\n\n2:37:43.900 --> 2:37:45.340\n that if voting really changed anything,\n\n2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:46.980\n they'd never allow it.\n\n2:37:46.980 --> 2:37:51.900\n If love through a modern day successor to Twitter\n\n2:37:51.900 --> 2:37:53.780\n would really do what you want it to do,\n\n2:37:53.780 --> 2:37:56.500\n and this would destabilize governments,\n\n2:37:56.500 --> 2:38:00.540\n do you think that governments would take countermeasures\n\n2:38:00.540 --> 2:38:03.620\n to squash that love before it got too dangerous?\n\n2:38:03.620 --> 2:38:04.820\n There's several answers.\n\n2:38:04.820 --> 2:38:06.900\n One, first of all, I don't actually,\n\n2:38:06.900 --> 2:38:08.740\n to push back on something you said earlier,\n\n2:38:08.740 --> 2:38:12.700\n I don't think love is as much of an enemy of the state\n\n2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:14.940\n as one would think.\n\n2:38:14.940 --> 2:38:16.860\n Different states have different views.\n\n2:38:20.100 --> 2:38:22.540\n I think the states want power,\n\n2:38:22.540 --> 2:38:27.460\n and I don't always think that love is in tension with power.\n\n2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:34.620\n I think it's not just about love,\n\n2:38:34.620 --> 2:38:37.940\n it's about rationality, it's reason, it's empathy,\n\n2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:39.060\n all of those things.\n\n2:38:39.060 --> 2:38:42.740\n I don't necessarily think there always have to be\n\n2:38:42.740 --> 2:38:45.660\n by definition in conflict with each other.\n\n2:38:45.660 --> 2:38:50.100\n So that's one sense is I feel like basically\n\n2:38:50.100 --> 2:38:54.900\n you can Trojan horse love into behind,\n\n2:38:54.900 --> 2:38:56.100\n but you have to be good at it.\n\n2:38:56.100 --> 2:38:57.060\n This is the thing,\n\n2:38:58.420 --> 2:39:01.500\n is you have to be conscious of the way these states think.\n\n2:39:01.500 --> 2:39:05.700\n So the fact that China bans certain services and so on,\n\n2:39:05.700 --> 2:39:09.340\n that means the companies weren't eloquent,\n\n2:39:09.340 --> 2:39:10.900\n whoever the companies are,\n\n2:39:10.900 --> 2:39:14.500\n weren't actually good at infiltrating.\n\n2:39:16.900 --> 2:39:19.780\n I think, isn't that a song, like love is a battlefield?\n\n2:39:19.780 --> 2:39:22.500\n I think it's all a cap editor.\n\n2:39:22.500 --> 2:39:25.700\n It's all a game, and you have to be good at the game.\n\n2:39:25.700 --> 2:39:28.780\n And just like Elon, we said with Tesla\n\n2:39:28.780 --> 2:39:32.380\n and saving the environment.\n\n2:39:32.380 --> 2:39:35.260\n I mean, that's not just by getting on a stage\n\n2:39:35.260 --> 2:39:37.700\n and saying it's important to save the environment,\n\n2:39:37.700 --> 2:39:42.700\n is by building a product that people can't help but love\n\n2:39:43.540 --> 2:39:46.100\n and then convincing Hollywood stars to love it.\n\n2:39:46.100 --> 2:39:48.740\n Like there's a game to be played.\n\n2:39:48.740 --> 2:39:50.580\n Okay, so let me build on that\n\n2:39:50.580 --> 2:39:52.420\n because I think there's a way to see this.\n\n2:39:52.420 --> 2:39:53.260\n I think you're right.\n\n2:39:53.260 --> 2:39:57.020\n And so it has to do with a story about the 1960s.\n\n2:39:57.020 --> 2:39:59.580\n In the vast scheme of things, the 1960s looks like\n\n2:39:59.580 --> 2:40:03.740\n a revival of neo romantic ideas, right?\n\n2:40:03.740 --> 2:40:05.660\n I had a buddy of mine several years,\n\n2:40:05.660 --> 2:40:09.020\n well, two decades older than I was who was in the 60s,\n\n2:40:09.020 --> 2:40:11.380\n went to the protest, did all those kinds of things.\n\n2:40:11.380 --> 2:40:14.020\n And we were talking about it and I was romanticizing it.\n\n2:40:14.020 --> 2:40:15.300\n He said, don't romanticize it.\n\n2:40:15.300 --> 2:40:16.780\n He goes, let me tell you, most of the people\n\n2:40:16.780 --> 2:40:19.560\n that went to those protests and did all those things,\n\n2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:21.960\n all they were there was to meet girls and have a good time.\n\n2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:23.620\n And it wasn't so,\n\n2:40:23.620 --> 2:40:28.620\n but it became in vogue to have all,\n\n2:40:29.100 --> 2:40:32.100\n in other words, let's talk about your empathy and love.\n\n2:40:32.100 --> 2:40:33.900\n You're never gonna, in my opinion,\n\n2:40:33.900 --> 2:40:36.420\n grab that great mass of people that are only in it\n\n2:40:36.420 --> 2:40:38.340\n for their interest in whatever.\n\n2:40:38.340 --> 2:40:42.500\n But if meeting girls for a young teenage guy\n\n2:40:42.500 --> 2:40:45.900\n requires you to feign empathy,\n\n2:40:45.900 --> 2:40:49.300\n requires you to read deeper subjects\n\n2:40:49.300 --> 2:40:52.020\n because that's what people are into,\n\n2:40:52.020 --> 2:40:55.580\n you can almost, as a silly way to be trendy,\n\n2:40:55.580 --> 2:40:59.460\n you could make maybe empathy trendy, love trendy,\n\n2:40:59.460 --> 2:41:02.340\n solutions that are the opposite of that,\n\n2:41:03.260 --> 2:41:05.660\n the kind of things that people inherently\n\n2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:07.140\n will not put up with.\n\n2:41:07.140 --> 2:41:09.540\n In other words, the possibility exists\n\n2:41:09.540 --> 2:41:13.820\n to change the zeitgeist and reorient it in a way\n\n2:41:13.820 --> 2:41:17.180\n that even if most of the people aren't serious about it,\n\n2:41:17.180 --> 2:41:19.060\n the results are the same.\n\n2:41:19.060 --> 2:41:19.880\n Does that make sense?\n\n2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:21.080\n Absolutely. Okay.\n\n2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:23.460\n Okay, so we've found a meeting of the moments.\n\n2:41:23.460 --> 2:41:24.300\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:41:24.300 --> 2:41:29.300\n Creating incentives that encourage the best\n\n2:41:29.860 --> 2:41:32.060\n and the most beautiful aspects of human nature.\n\n2:41:32.060 --> 2:41:33.780\n Even against our will.\n\n2:41:33.780 --> 2:41:36.420\n It all boils down to meeting girls and boys.\n\n2:41:37.660 --> 2:41:39.180\n Once again, you're getting to the bottom\n\n2:41:39.180 --> 2:41:40.940\n of the evolutionary motivations\n\n2:41:40.940 --> 2:41:42.940\n and you're always on safe ground when you do that.\n\n2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:43.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:41:43.820 --> 2:41:45.420\n That's a little difficult for me.\n\n2:41:46.300 --> 2:41:48.260\n And I'm sure it's actually difficult for you\n\n2:41:48.260 --> 2:41:51.180\n to listen to me say complimenting you,\n\n2:41:51.180 --> 2:41:56.180\n but it's difficult for both of us, okay?\n\n2:41:57.020 --> 2:42:01.140\n So, but you and I, as I mentioned to you,\n\n2:42:01.140 --> 2:42:03.420\n I think off mic, been friends for a long time.\n\n2:42:03.420 --> 2:42:05.060\n It's just been one way.\n\n2:42:05.060 --> 2:42:06.740\n It's two way now.\n\n2:42:06.740 --> 2:42:08.100\n It's two way now.\n\n2:42:08.100 --> 2:42:10.820\n So that's the beauty of podcasting.\n\n2:42:10.820 --> 2:42:12.860\n Now, just been fortunate enough\n\n2:42:12.860 --> 2:42:14.260\n with this particular podcast\n\n2:42:14.260 --> 2:42:17.320\n that I see it in people's eyes when they meet me,\n\n2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:20.980\n that they've been friends with me for a few years now.\n\n2:42:20.980 --> 2:42:25.100\n And we become fast friends actually after we start talking.\n\n2:42:25.100 --> 2:42:28.560\n But it's one way in the vet in that first moment.\n\n2:42:30.020 --> 2:42:32.220\n You know, like there's something about\n\n2:42:32.220 --> 2:42:34.460\n the especially hardcore history that,\n\n2:42:34.460 --> 2:42:37.900\n you know, I do some crazy challenges and running and stuff.\n\n2:42:37.900 --> 2:42:40.780\n I remember in particular, probably don't have time.\n\n2:42:40.780 --> 2:42:44.300\n One of my favorite episodes, the painful tainment one.\n\n2:42:44.300 --> 2:42:46.140\n Some people hate that episode.\n\n2:42:46.140 --> 2:42:47.420\n Because it's too real.\n\n2:42:47.420 --> 2:42:49.100\n Yeah, they can't listen to it.\n\n2:42:49.100 --> 2:42:50.120\n It's my darkest one.\n\n2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:51.480\n We wanted to set a baseline.\n\n2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:53.100\n That's the baseline.\n\n2:42:53.100 --> 2:42:54.980\n But I remember listening to that\n\n2:42:54.980 --> 2:42:58.340\n when I ran 22 miles for me, that was a long distance.\n\n2:42:58.340 --> 2:43:00.780\n Holy cow, that's painful tainment right there.\n\n2:43:00.780 --> 2:43:03.580\n Yeah, and it just pulls you in.\n\n2:43:03.580 --> 2:43:06.620\n There's something so powerful\n\n2:43:06.620 --> 2:43:09.080\n about this particular creation\n\n2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:12.100\n that's bigger than you actually, that you've created.\n\n2:43:12.100 --> 2:43:13.140\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n2:43:13.140 --> 2:43:14.980\n I think anything that is successful like that,\n\n2:43:14.980 --> 2:43:17.140\n like Elon's stuff too, it becomes bigger than you.\n\n2:43:17.140 --> 2:43:18.900\n And that's what you're hoping for, right?\n\n2:43:18.900 --> 2:43:19.740\n Absolutely.\n\n2:43:19.740 --> 2:43:20.940\n Didn't mean to interrupt you, I apologize.\n\n2:43:20.940 --> 2:43:25.940\n I guess a question I have, if you look in the mirror,\n\n2:43:26.060 --> 2:43:27.460\n but you also look at me,\n\n2:43:29.220 --> 2:43:34.220\n what advice would you give to yourself and to me\n\n2:43:34.340 --> 2:43:37.500\n and to other podcasters, maybe to Joe Rogan,\n\n2:43:37.500 --> 2:43:40.040\n about this journey that we're on?\n\n2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:41.860\n I feel like it's something special.\n\n2:43:41.860 --> 2:43:44.040\n I'm not sure exactly what's happening.\n\n2:43:44.040 --> 2:43:46.300\n But it feels like podcasting is special.\n\n2:43:48.300 --> 2:43:51.520\n What advice, and I'm relatively new to it,\n\n2:43:52.540 --> 2:43:55.300\n what advice do you have for people\n\n2:43:55.300 --> 2:43:58.500\n that are carrying this flame and traveling this journey?\n\n2:43:59.580 --> 2:44:03.620\n Well, I'm often asked for advice by new podcasters,\n\n2:44:03.620 --> 2:44:04.940\n people just starting out.\n\n2:44:04.940 --> 2:44:08.900\n And so I have sort of a tried and true list\n\n2:44:08.900 --> 2:44:11.340\n of do's and don'ts.\n\n2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:16.340\n But I don't have advice or suggestions for you or for Joe.\n\n2:44:18.140 --> 2:44:19.740\n Joe doesn't need anything from me.\n\n2:44:19.740 --> 2:44:21.260\n Joe's figured it out, right?\n\n2:44:21.260 --> 2:44:22.100\n I mean, he hasn't yet.\n\n2:44:22.100 --> 2:44:25.260\n He's still a confused kid, curious about the world.\n\n2:44:25.260 --> 2:44:26.780\n But that's the genius of it.\n\n2:44:26.780 --> 2:44:28.580\n That's what makes it work, right?\n\n2:44:28.580 --> 2:44:31.740\n That's what Joe's brand is, right?\n\n2:44:31.740 --> 2:44:32.900\n I guess what I'm saying is,\n\n2:44:32.900 --> 2:44:35.300\n by the time you reach the stage that you're at,\n\n2:44:35.300 --> 2:44:38.040\n or Joe's at, they don't need it.\n\n2:44:38.040 --> 2:44:39.480\n They have figured this out.\n\n2:44:39.480 --> 2:44:41.760\n The people that sometimes need help are brand new people\n\n2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:43.580\n trying to figure out what do I do with my first show\n\n2:44:43.580 --> 2:44:44.860\n and how do I talk into them?\n\n2:44:44.860 --> 2:44:47.020\n And I have standard answers for that.\n\n2:44:47.020 --> 2:44:48.420\n But you found your niche.\n\n2:44:48.420 --> 2:44:51.180\n I mean, you don't need me to tell you what to do.\n\n2:44:51.180 --> 2:44:52.940\n As a matter of fact, I might ask you questions\n\n2:44:52.940 --> 2:44:55.340\n about how you do what you do, right?\n\n2:44:55.340 --> 2:44:58.580\n Well, I guess there's specific things\n\n2:44:58.580 --> 2:45:01.660\n like we were talking offline about monetization.\n\n2:45:01.660 --> 2:45:03.260\n That's a fascinating one.\n\n2:45:03.260 --> 2:45:05.980\n Very difficult as an independent, yeah.\n\n2:45:05.980 --> 2:45:09.060\n And one of the things that Joe is facing\n\n2:45:09.060 --> 2:45:11.140\n with, I don't know if you're paying attention,\n\n2:45:11.140 --> 2:45:15.940\n but he joined Spotify with a $100 million deal\n\n2:45:15.940 --> 2:45:18.200\n for going exclusive on their platform.\n\n2:45:18.200 --> 2:45:19.900\n The idea of exclusivity that,\n\n2:45:19.900 --> 2:45:22.260\n one, I don't give a damn about money personally,\n\n2:45:22.260 --> 2:45:26.080\n but I'm single, and I like living in a shitty place.\n\n2:45:26.080 --> 2:45:30.540\n So I enjoy, so I guess it makes it easy.\n\n2:45:30.540 --> 2:45:32.580\n You get the freedom, right, to not care, yeah.\n\n2:45:32.580 --> 2:45:33.420\n Freedom.\n\n2:45:33.420 --> 2:45:34.240\n It's freedom.\n\n2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:35.840\n Not saving for anybody's college.\n\n2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:37.040\n Exactly. Yeah.\n\n2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:40.380\n Okay, so on that point, but I also,\n\n2:45:40.380 --> 2:45:41.980\n okay, maybe it's romanticization,\n\n2:45:41.980 --> 2:45:46.100\n but I feel like podcasting is pirate radio.\n\n2:45:46.100 --> 2:45:50.820\n And when I first heard about Spotify partnering up with Joe,\n\n2:45:50.820 --> 2:45:53.380\n I was like, you know, fuck the man.\n\n2:45:53.380 --> 2:45:57.280\n I said, I even, I drafted a few tweets and so on,\n\n2:45:57.280 --> 2:46:00.980\n just like attacking Spotify, then I calmed myself down\n\n2:46:00.980 --> 2:46:04.660\n that you can't lock up this special thing we have.\n\n2:46:04.660 --> 2:46:07.700\n But then I realized that maybe\n\n2:46:07.700 --> 2:46:11.900\n that these are vehicles for just reaching more people\n\n2:46:11.900 --> 2:46:15.120\n and actually respecting podcasters more and so on.\n\n2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:18.700\n So that's what I mean by it's unclear what the journey is\n\n2:46:18.700 --> 2:46:22.260\n because you also serve as beacon for,\n\n2:46:22.260 --> 2:46:26.400\n now there's like millions, one million plus podcasters.\n\n2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:31.540\n I wonder what the journey is.\n\n2:46:31.540 --> 2:46:32.780\n Do you have a sense,\n\n2:46:32.780 --> 2:46:36.860\n are you romantic in the same kind of way\n\n2:46:36.860 --> 2:46:41.060\n in feeling that, because you have a roots in radio too.\n\n2:46:41.060 --> 2:46:43.920\n Do you feel that podcasting is pirate radio\n\n2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:48.020\n or is the Spotify thing one possible avenue?\n\n2:46:48.020 --> 2:46:51.020\n Are you nervous about Joe as a fan, as a friend of Joe\n\n2:46:52.260 --> 2:46:55.940\n or is this a good thing for us?\n\n2:46:55.940 --> 2:46:58.380\n So my history of how I got involved\n\n2:46:58.380 --> 2:47:00.260\n in podcasting is interesting.\n\n2:47:00.260 --> 2:47:01.100\n Yes.\n\n2:47:01.100 --> 2:47:04.660\n I was in radio and then I started a company\n\n2:47:04.660 --> 2:47:08.100\n back in the era where the dot com boom was happening\n\n2:47:08.100 --> 2:47:09.280\n and everybody was being bought up\n\n2:47:09.280 --> 2:47:12.280\n and it just seemed like a great idea, right?\n\n2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:14.780\n I did it with six other people\n\n2:47:14.780 --> 2:47:18.020\n and the whole goal of the company was,\n\n2:47:18.020 --> 2:47:19.220\n we had to invent the term.\n\n2:47:19.220 --> 2:47:20.840\n I'm sure everybody, there's other places\n\n2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:22.180\n that invented it at the same time.\n\n2:47:22.180 --> 2:47:25.100\n But what we were pitching to investors\n\n2:47:25.100 --> 2:47:26.920\n was something called amateur content.\n\n2:47:26.920 --> 2:47:29.220\n So this is before YouTube, before podcasting,\n\n2:47:29.220 --> 2:47:30.980\n before all this stuff.\n\n2:47:30.980 --> 2:47:34.500\n And my job was to be the evangelist.\n\n2:47:34.500 --> 2:47:36.580\n And I would go to these people and talk\n\n2:47:36.580 --> 2:47:39.640\n and sing the praises of all the ways\n\n2:47:39.640 --> 2:47:42.260\n that amateur content was gonna be great.\n\n2:47:42.260 --> 2:47:45.340\n And I never got a bite.\n\n2:47:45.340 --> 2:47:46.860\n And they all told me the same thing.\n\n2:47:46.860 --> 2:47:47.940\n This isn't gonna take off\n\n2:47:47.940 --> 2:47:50.360\n cause anybody who's good is already gonna be making money\n\n2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:51.200\n at this.\n\n2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:53.100\n And I kept saying, forget that.\n\n2:47:53.100 --> 2:47:55.260\n We're talking about scale here.\n\n2:47:55.260 --> 2:47:57.560\n If you have millions of pieces of content\n\n2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:00.080\n being made every week, a small percentage\n\n2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:01.540\n is gonna be good no matter what, right?\n\n2:48:01.540 --> 2:48:03.980\n 16 year olds will know what other 16 year olds like.\n\n2:48:03.980 --> 2:48:06.100\n I kept pushing this nobody bit.\n\n2:48:06.100 --> 2:48:07.540\n But the podcast grew out of that\n\n2:48:07.540 --> 2:48:12.540\n because if you're talking about amateur content in 1999,\n\n2:48:12.900 --> 2:48:16.920\n well then you're already, you're ahead of the game\n\n2:48:16.920 --> 2:48:20.380\n in terms of not seeing where it's gonna go financially\n\n2:48:20.380 --> 2:48:23.140\n but seeing where it's going to go technologically.\n\n2:48:23.140 --> 2:48:25.500\n And so when we started the podcast in 2005\n\n2:48:25.500 --> 2:48:28.020\n and it was the political one, not hardcore history,\n\n2:48:28.020 --> 2:48:30.940\n which was an outgrowth of the old radio show,\n\n2:48:30.940 --> 2:48:34.540\n we didn't have any financial ideas.\n\n2:48:34.540 --> 2:48:37.460\n We were simply trying to get our handle on the technology\n\n2:48:37.460 --> 2:48:38.980\n and how you distribute it to people and all that.\n\n2:48:38.980 --> 2:48:41.940\n And it was years later that we tried to figure out,\n\n2:48:41.940 --> 2:48:43.060\n okay, how can we get enough money\n\n2:48:43.060 --> 2:48:45.060\n to just support us while we're doing this?\n\n2:48:45.060 --> 2:48:46.620\n And the cheap and the easy way\n\n2:48:46.620 --> 2:48:49.620\n was just to ask listeners to donate like a PBS kind of model.\n\n2:48:49.620 --> 2:48:51.520\n And that was the original model.\n\n2:48:52.940 --> 2:48:55.180\n So then once we started down that,\n\n2:48:55.180 --> 2:48:57.500\n we figured out other models and there's the advertising thing\n\n2:48:57.500 --> 2:48:58.740\n and that we sell the old shows.\n\n2:48:58.740 --> 2:49:01.800\n And so all these became ways for us to support ourselves.\n\n2:49:03.220 --> 2:49:06.920\n But as podcasting matured\n\n2:49:06.920 --> 2:49:09.820\n and as more operating systems developed\n\n2:49:09.820 --> 2:49:13.500\n and phones were developed and all these kinds of things,\n\n2:49:13.500 --> 2:49:15.300\n every one of those developments,\n\n2:49:15.300 --> 2:49:18.580\n which actually made it easier for people to get the podcast\n\n2:49:18.580 --> 2:49:22.060\n actually made it more complex to make money off of them.\n\n2:49:22.060 --> 2:49:24.140\n So while our audience was building,\n\n2:49:24.140 --> 2:49:26.020\n the amount of time and effort we had to put\n\n2:49:26.020 --> 2:49:29.940\n into the monetization side began to skyrocket.\n\n2:49:29.940 --> 2:49:31.820\n So to get back to your Spotify question,\n\n2:49:31.820 --> 2:49:32.820\n to use just one example,\n\n2:49:32.820 --> 2:49:35.480\n there's a lot of people who are doing similar things.\n\n2:49:36.820 --> 2:49:39.660\n In this day and age, we used to just sell MP3 files.\n\n2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:41.060\n And all you had to have was an MP3 player,\n\n2:49:41.060 --> 2:49:42.660\n it's cheap and dirty.\n\n2:49:42.660 --> 2:49:45.140\n Now, every time there's an OS upgrade,\n\n2:49:45.140 --> 2:49:46.720\n something breaks for us.\n\n2:49:46.720 --> 2:49:49.340\n So we're having, I mean, my choices are at this point\n\n2:49:49.340 --> 2:49:51.460\n to start hiring staff, more staff,\n\n2:49:51.460 --> 2:49:54.260\n and then be a human resources manager.\n\n2:49:54.260 --> 2:49:55.980\n I mean, the pirate radio side of this\n\n2:49:55.980 --> 2:49:57.300\n was the pirate radio side of this\n\n2:49:57.300 --> 2:49:58.500\n because you didn't need anybody,\n\n2:49:58.500 --> 2:50:00.340\n but you know, you or you and another,\n\n2:50:00.340 --> 2:50:02.140\n I mean, you could just do this lean and mean,\n\n2:50:02.140 --> 2:50:05.280\n and it's becoming hard to do it lean and mean now.\n\n2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:07.460\n So if somebody like a Spotify comes in and says,\n\n2:50:07.460 --> 2:50:10.780\n hey, we'll handle that stuff for you.\n\n2:50:10.780 --> 2:50:12.640\n In the past, I would just say,\n\n2:50:12.640 --> 2:50:15.300\n F off, we don't need you, I don't mind.\n\n2:50:15.300 --> 2:50:18.300\n And I definitely am not making what we could make on this,\n\n2:50:18.300 --> 2:50:22.420\n but what we would have to do to make that is onerous to me.\n\n2:50:22.420 --> 2:50:25.860\n But it's becoming onerous to me day to day anyway.\n\n2:50:25.860 --> 2:50:28.380\n And so if somebody were to come in and say,\n\n2:50:28.380 --> 2:50:30.340\n hey, we'll pick that up for you,\n\n2:50:30.340 --> 2:50:32.600\n we will not interfere with your content at all,\n\n2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:34.260\n we won't, and in my case, you can't say,\n\n2:50:34.260 --> 2:50:36.720\n we need to show a month because that ain't happening, right?\n\n2:50:36.720 --> 2:50:40.540\n So I mean, everybody's design is different, right?\n\n2:50:40.540 --> 2:50:43.300\n So it doesn't, you know, there's not one size fits all,\n\n2:50:43.300 --> 2:50:47.040\n but I guess as a long time pirate podcaster,\n\n2:50:48.740 --> 2:50:50.140\n we've been looking to partner with people,\n\n2:50:50.140 --> 2:50:51.940\n but nobody's right for us to partner with.\n\n2:50:51.940 --> 2:50:55.940\n I mean, so I'm always looking for ways\n\n2:50:55.940 --> 2:50:58.300\n to take that side of it off my plate\n\n2:50:58.300 --> 2:50:59.600\n because I'm not interested in that side.\n\n2:50:59.600 --> 2:51:02.020\n All I wanna do is the shows,\n\n2:51:02.020 --> 2:51:04.540\n and it's really at this point,\n\n2:51:04.540 --> 2:51:06.500\n you shouldn't call yourself an artist\n\n2:51:06.500 --> 2:51:08.820\n because that's something to be decided by others.\n\n2:51:08.820 --> 2:51:11.740\n But I mean, we're trying to do art\n\n2:51:11.740 --> 2:51:15.020\n and there's something very satisfying in that.\n\n2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:16.780\n But the part that I can't stand\n\n2:51:16.780 --> 2:51:19.280\n is the increasing amount of time\n\n2:51:19.280 --> 2:51:22.220\n the monetization question takes upon us.\n\n2:51:22.220 --> 2:51:26.460\n So there's a case to be made, I guess is what I'm saying,\n\n2:51:26.460 --> 2:51:29.700\n that if a partnership with some outside firm\n\n2:51:29.700 --> 2:51:32.500\n enhances your ability to do the art\n\n2:51:32.500 --> 2:51:36.100\n without disenhancing your ability to do the art,\n\n2:51:36.100 --> 2:51:41.100\n it's, the word I'm looking for here is it's enticing.\n\n2:51:42.260 --> 2:51:44.500\n I don't like big companies.\n\n2:51:44.500 --> 2:51:49.500\n So I'm afraid of whatever strings might come with that.\n\n2:51:49.540 --> 2:51:52.220\n And if I'm Joe Rogan and I'm talking about subjects\n\n2:51:52.220 --> 2:51:55.860\n that can make public companies a little nervous,\n\n2:51:55.860 --> 2:51:57.300\n I would certainly be careful.\n\n2:51:57.300 --> 2:52:00.520\n But at the same time, people who are not in this game\n\n2:52:00.520 --> 2:52:04.540\n don't understand the problems that literally,\n\n2:52:04.540 --> 2:52:07.580\n I mean, just all the operating systems, all the podcatchers,\n\n2:52:07.580 --> 2:52:09.440\n every time some new podcatcher comes up,\n\n2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:10.980\n makes it easier to get the podcast,\n\n2:52:10.980 --> 2:52:14.220\n that's something we have to account for on the back end.\n\n2:52:14.220 --> 2:52:17.740\n And I'm not exactly the technological wizard of all time.\n\n2:52:17.740 --> 2:52:21.900\n So I think it is maybe, maybe the short answer is,\n\n2:52:21.900 --> 2:52:24.300\n is that as the medium develops,\n\n2:52:24.300 --> 2:52:26.860\n it's becoming something that you have to consider,\n\n2:52:26.860 --> 2:52:28.900\n not because you wanna sell out,\n\n2:52:28.900 --> 2:52:30.420\n but because you wanna keep going.\n\n2:52:30.420 --> 2:52:34.020\n And it's becoming harder and harder to be pirate like\n\n2:52:34.020 --> 2:52:35.420\n in this environment.\n\n2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:39.060\n The thing that convinced me, especially inside Spotify,\n\n2:52:39.060 --> 2:52:41.720\n is that they understand,\n\n2:52:41.720 --> 2:52:45.960\n so if you walk into this whole thing with some skepticism,\n\n2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:48.360\n as you're saying, of big companies,\n\n2:52:48.360 --> 2:52:52.080\n then it works because Spotify understands the magic\n\n2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:56.520\n that makes podcasting, or they appear to in part,\n\n2:52:56.520 --> 2:53:00.240\n at least they understand enough to respect Joe Rogan.\n\n2:53:00.240 --> 2:53:02.920\n And despite what, I don't know if you,\n\n2:53:02.920 --> 2:53:04.520\n so there's the internet and there's people\n\n2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:05.800\n with opinions on the internet.\n\n2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:06.640\n Really? Yes.\n\n2:53:06.640 --> 2:53:07.880\n I've not heard about that.\n\n2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:11.920\n And they have opinions about Joe and Spotify.\n\n2:53:11.920 --> 2:53:14.760\n But the reality is, there's two things\n\n2:53:14.760 --> 2:53:16.720\n in private conversation with Joe,\n\n2:53:16.720 --> 2:53:19.520\n and in general, there's two important things.\n\n2:53:19.520 --> 2:53:22.800\n One, Spotify literally doesn't tell Joe anything.\n\n2:53:22.800 --> 2:53:25.800\n Like all the people that think that Spotify\n\n2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:28.200\n is somehow pushing Joe in this direction.\n\n2:53:28.200 --> 2:53:30.520\n It's a contractual, didn't he insist upon that?\n\n2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:31.360\n It's in the contract.\n\n2:53:31.360 --> 2:53:34.000\n But also, companies have a way of,\n\n2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000\n even with the contract. They sure do.\n\n2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:39.040\n To be marketing people, hey, I know we're not forcing you.\n\n2:53:39.040 --> 2:53:39.880\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:53:39.880 --> 2:53:41.080\n I hate that.\n\n2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:42.840\n Yeah, I'm with you.\n\n2:53:42.840 --> 2:53:44.400\n You and Joe are the same,\n\n2:53:44.400 --> 2:53:45.960\n and Spotify is smart enough\n\n2:53:45.960 --> 2:53:48.280\n not to send a single email of that kind.\n\n2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:49.600\n That's really smart.\n\n2:53:49.600 --> 2:53:51.320\n And they leave them be.\n\n2:53:51.320 --> 2:53:55.840\n There is meetings inside Spotify that people complain,\n\n2:53:55.840 --> 2:53:58.040\n but those meetings never reach Joe.\n\n2:53:58.040 --> 2:54:00.440\n That's like company stuff.\n\n2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:04.760\n And the idea that Spotify is different than pirate radio,\n\n2:54:04.760 --> 2:54:07.320\n the difficult thing about podcasting\n\n2:54:07.320 --> 2:54:10.120\n is nobody gives a damn about your podcast.\n\n2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:11.760\n You're alone in this.\n\n2:54:11.760 --> 2:54:14.000\n I mean, there's fans and stuff, but nobody.\n\n2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:15.040\n Nobody's looking out for you.\n\n2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:15.880\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:17.360\n And the nice thing about Spotify\n\n2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:21.720\n is they want Joe's podcast to succeed even more.\n\n2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:23.960\n That's what Joe talked about\n\n2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:27.080\n is that's the difference between YouTube and Spotify.\n\n2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:30.000\n Spotify wants to be the Netflix of podcasting.\n\n2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:32.360\n And they, like what Netflix does\n\n2:54:32.360 --> 2:54:37.160\n is they don't want to control you in any way,\n\n2:54:37.160 --> 2:54:40.680\n but they want to create a platform where you can flourish.\n\n2:54:40.680 --> 2:54:41.520\n Even more.\n\n2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:42.360\n Because your interests are aligned.\n\n2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:43.200\n Interests are aligned.\n\n2:54:43.200 --> 2:54:45.560\n So let me bring up something that,\n\n2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:46.600\n let's make a distinction\n\n2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:50.520\n because not all companies who do this are the same.\n\n2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:52.080\n And you brought up YouTube and Spotify,\n\n2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:55.000\n but to me, YouTube is at least more like Spotify\n\n2:54:55.000 --> 2:54:56.760\n than some of these smaller.\n\n2:54:56.760 --> 2:54:58.560\n The term is walled garden, right?\n\n2:54:58.560 --> 2:54:59.800\n You've heard the term walled garden?\n\n2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:00.640\n Yes. Okay.\n\n2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:04.080\n So I've been around podcasting so long now\n\n2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:07.200\n that I've seen rounds of consolidation over the years\n\n2:55:07.200 --> 2:55:09.520\n and they come in waves and all of a sudden,\n\n2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:12.120\n so you'll get, and I'm not going to mention any names,\n\n2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:13.840\n but up until recently,\n\n2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:16.880\n the consolidation was happening with relatively small firms\n\n2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:18.840\n compared to people like Spotify.\n\n2:55:18.840 --> 2:55:20.160\n And the problem was,\n\n2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:23.360\n is that by deciding to consolidate your materials\n\n2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:25.000\n in a walled garden,\n\n2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:28.360\n you are walling yourself off from audience, right?\n\n2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:30.400\n So your choice is I'm going to accept this amount of money\n\n2:55:30.400 --> 2:55:31.240\n from this company,\n\n2:55:31.240 --> 2:55:33.960\n but the loss is going to be a large chunk of my audience.\n\n2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:35.200\n And that's a catch 22\n\n2:55:35.200 --> 2:55:37.480\n because you're negotiating power with that company\n\n2:55:37.480 --> 2:55:39.280\n is based on your audience size.\n\n2:55:39.280 --> 2:55:41.360\n So signing up with them diminishes your audience size,\n\n2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:43.400\n you lose negotiating power.\n\n2:55:43.400 --> 2:55:46.840\n But when you get to the level of the Spotify\n\n2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:49.480\n to just pick them out, there's other players,\n\n2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:51.480\n but you brought up Spotify specifically,\n\n2:55:51.480 --> 2:55:54.320\n these are people who can potentially,\n\n2:55:54.320 --> 2:55:57.880\n potentially enhance your audience over time.\n\n2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:00.800\n And so the risk to you is lower\n\n2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:03.440\n because if you decide in a year or two,\n\n2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:05.880\n whatever the licensing agreements term is,\n\n2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:07.840\n that you're done with them and you want to leave,\n\n2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:09.640\n instead of how you would have been\n\n2:56:09.640 --> 2:56:11.560\n with some of these smaller walled gardens,\n\n2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:14.320\n where you're walking away with a fraction of the audience\n\n2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:15.560\n you walked in with,\n\n2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:17.660\n you have the potential to walk out\n\n2:56:17.660 --> 2:56:19.760\n with whatever you got in the original deal,\n\n2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:21.240\n plus a larger audience,\n\n2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:22.840\n because their algorithms and everything\n\n2:56:22.840 --> 2:56:26.440\n are designed to push people to your content\n\n2:56:26.440 --> 2:56:27.520\n if they think you'd like.\n\n2:56:27.520 --> 2:56:31.320\n So it takes away some of the downside risk,\n\n2:56:31.320 --> 2:56:33.280\n which alleviates,\n\n2:56:33.280 --> 2:56:35.320\n and if you can write an agreement like Joe Rogan,\n\n2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:37.560\n I mean, where you've protected your freedom\n\n2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:39.340\n to put the content out the way you want.\n\n2:56:39.340 --> 2:56:42.320\n So, and if some of the downside risk is mitigated,\n\n2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:45.840\n and if you eliminate the problem of trying to monetize\n\n2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:47.560\n and stay up with the latest tech,\n\n2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:49.240\n then it might be worth it.\n\n2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:51.040\n You know, I'm scared of things like that,\n\n2:56:51.040 --> 2:56:51.960\n but at the same time,\n\n2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:54.780\n I'm trying to not be an idiot about it,\n\n2:56:54.780 --> 2:56:56.760\n and I can be an idiot about it.\n\n2:56:56.760 --> 2:56:59.360\n And when you've been doing it as independently\n\n2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:00.800\n for as long as I have,\n\n2:57:00.800 --> 2:57:04.640\n the inertia of that has a force all its own,\n\n2:57:04.640 --> 2:57:09.560\n but I'm inhibited enough in what I'm trying to do\n\n2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:10.840\n on this other end,\n\n2:57:10.840 --> 2:57:13.680\n that it's opened me at least to listening to people.\n\n2:57:14.900 --> 2:57:18.640\n But listen, at the same time, I love my audience,\n\n2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:20.840\n and it sounds like a cliche,\n\n2:57:20.840 --> 2:57:23.640\n but they're literally the reason I'm here.\n\n2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:26.040\n So I wanna make sure that whatever I do,\n\n2:57:26.040 --> 2:57:29.760\n if I can, is in keeping with a relationship\n\n2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:32.900\n that I've developed with these people over 15 years.\n\n2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:36.560\n But like you said, no matter what you do,\n\n2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:38.120\n you are, because see, here's the thing.\n\n2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:40.020\n If you don't sign up with one of those companies\n\n2:57:40.020 --> 2:57:42.660\n to make it easier for them to get your stuff on this hand,\n\n2:57:42.660 --> 2:57:45.100\n they might yell at you for how difficult it is,\n\n2:57:45.100 --> 2:57:48.080\n because the new operating system just updated,\n\n2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:49.120\n and you said, I can't get your stuff.\n\n2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:52.120\n So either way, you're opening yourself up to ridicule\n\n2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:52.960\n at this point.\n\n2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:55.200\n All of that makes it easier to go,\n\n2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:56.840\n well, if the right deal came along,\n\n2:57:56.840 --> 2:57:57.680\n and they weren't screwing me,\n\n2:57:57.680 --> 2:58:00.500\n and they weren't screwing my audience, and blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:58:00.500 --> 2:58:01.880\n I mean, again, in this business,\n\n2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:03.800\n when you're talking about cutting edge technology\n\n2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:04.940\n that is ever changing,\n\n2:58:04.940 --> 2:58:08.040\n and as you said, a million podcasts and growing,\n\n2:58:08.040 --> 2:58:10.760\n I think you have to try to maintain flexibility,\n\n2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:14.080\n and especially if they can mitigate the downside risk,\n\n2:58:14.080 --> 2:58:19.080\n I think you'd be an idiot to not at least try to stay up\n\n2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:20.040\n on the current trends.\n\n2:58:20.040 --> 2:58:22.120\n And look, I'm watching Joe.\n\n2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:24.280\n I'm going, okay, let's see how it goes for Joe.\n\n2:58:24.280 --> 2:58:26.700\n I mean, if he's like, ah, this is terrible,\n\n2:58:26.700 --> 2:58:27.540\n I'm getting out of this,\n\n2:58:27.540 --> 2:58:29.640\n you go, okay, those people are off the list.\n\n2:58:29.640 --> 2:58:31.840\n So Joe's put himself out as a guinea pig,\n\n2:58:31.840 --> 2:58:34.000\n and the rest of us guinea pigs appreciate it.\n\n2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:36.560\n As a huge, as a fan of your show,\n\n2:58:36.560 --> 2:58:40.400\n and as a fan of Netflix, the people there,\n\n2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:44.000\n I think I can speak for like millions of people\n\n2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:46.920\n in hope that hardcore history comes to Netflix,\n\n2:58:46.920 --> 2:58:49.520\n or if Spotify becomes the Netflix of podcasting,\n\n2:58:49.520 --> 2:58:50.720\n then to Spotify.\n\n2:58:50.720 --> 2:58:53.020\n There's something at its best\n\n2:58:53.020 --> 2:58:56.080\n that they bring out the, you said artists,\n\n2:58:56.080 --> 2:58:57.600\n so I can say it,\n\n2:58:57.600 --> 2:58:59.720\n is they bring out the best out of the artists.\n\n2:58:59.720 --> 2:59:02.820\n They remove some of the headache,\n\n2:59:02.820 --> 2:59:07.820\n and somehow like they put at their best,\n\n2:59:08.160 --> 2:59:11.760\n Netflix, for example, is able to enforce\n\n2:59:11.760 --> 2:59:14.420\n and find the beauty and the power\n\n2:59:14.420 --> 2:59:17.800\n in the creations that you make even better than you.\n\n2:59:17.800 --> 2:59:20.580\n Like they don't interfere with the creations,\n\n2:59:20.580 --> 2:59:24.400\n but they somehow, it's a branding thing probably too.\n\n2:59:24.400 --> 2:59:25.240\n Yeah, but interfering would be,\n\n2:59:25.240 --> 2:59:26.520\n that would be a no go for me.\n\n2:59:26.520 --> 2:59:28.000\n That's right, absolutely.\n\n2:59:28.000 --> 2:59:28.840\n That can't happen.\n\n2:59:28.840 --> 2:59:31.000\n But that's why Netflix is masterful.\n\n2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:34.020\n They seem to not interfere with the talent,\n\n2:59:34.020 --> 2:59:36.460\n as opposed to, I could throw other people under the bus,\n\n2:59:36.460 --> 2:59:37.300\n like Amazon.\n\n2:59:37.300 --> 2:59:38.400\n There's a lot of places under the bus\n\n2:59:38.400 --> 2:59:39.800\n that could be thrown, absolutely.\n\n2:59:39.800 --> 2:59:41.800\n So I would love, I know there's probably\n\n2:59:41.800 --> 2:59:43.560\n people screaming yes right now.\n\n2:59:43.560 --> 2:59:45.520\n In terms of hardcore history on Netflix,\n\n2:59:45.520 --> 2:59:46.520\n it would be awesome.\n\n2:59:46.520 --> 2:59:51.120\n And I don't love asking this question,\n\n2:59:51.120 --> 2:59:55.580\n but it's asked probably the most popular question\n\n2:59:55.580 --> 2:59:57.060\n that's unanswerable.\n\n2:59:57.060 --> 2:59:59.320\n So let me try to ask it in a way\n\n2:59:59.320 --> 3:00:01.520\n that you would actually answer it,\n\n3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:02.760\n which is, of course, you said\n\n3:00:02.760 --> 3:00:05.040\n you don't release shows very often.\n\n3:00:05.040 --> 3:00:08.760\n And the question is, or the requests and the questions is,\n\n3:00:08.760 --> 3:00:11.760\n well, can you tell Dan to do one on the Civil War?\n\n3:00:11.760 --> 3:00:14.240\n Can you tell Dan to do one on the Napoleon Bonaparte?\n\n3:00:14.240 --> 3:00:16.400\n Can you tell him to do one?\n\n3:00:16.400 --> 3:00:18.660\n Every topic, and you've spoken to this.\n\n3:00:18.660 --> 3:00:20.040\n Actually, your answer about the Civil War\n\n3:00:20.040 --> 3:00:21.040\n is quite interesting.\n\n3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:22.880\n I didn't know you knew what my answer\n\n3:00:22.880 --> 3:00:24.880\n about the Civil War was.\n\n3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:27.520\n As a military historian, you enjoy, in particular,\n\n3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:29.960\n when there is differences in the armies,\n\n3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:32.400\n as opposed to contrasts.\n\n3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:34.680\n With the Civil War, which blew my mind\n\n3:00:34.680 --> 3:00:38.880\n when I heard you say there's not an interesting,\n\n3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:42.200\n a deep, intricate contrast between the two opposing sides.\n\n3:00:42.200 --> 3:00:43.120\n It's like the Roman Civil Wars,\n\n3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:45.520\n where it's legionary against legionary.\n\n3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:49.080\n And you've also said that the shows you work on\n\n3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:51.320\n are ones where you have some roots\n\n3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:54.720\n of fundamental understanding about that period.\n\n3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:57.380\n And so, when you work on a show,\n\n3:00:57.380 --> 3:01:00.360\n it's basically pulling at those strings further\n\n3:01:00.360 --> 3:01:02.960\n and refreshing your mind and learning.\n\n3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:04.680\n You have definitely done the research.\n\n3:01:04.680 --> 3:01:06.280\n Wow, these are words out of my mouth.\n\n3:01:06.280 --> 3:01:07.680\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:12.680\n But is there something like shower thoughts on Reddit?\n\n3:01:12.680 --> 3:01:16.920\n Is there some ideas that are lingering in your head\n\n3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:19.600\n about possible future episodes?\n\n3:01:19.600 --> 3:01:23.960\n Is there things that, whether you're not committing\n\n3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:27.840\n to anything, but whether you're gonna do it or not,\n\n3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:29.920\n is there something that makes you think,\n\n3:01:29.920 --> 3:01:34.040\n hmm, that'll be interesting to pull at that thread\n\n3:01:34.040 --> 3:01:35.600\n a little bit?\n\n3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:38.400\n Oh yeah, we have things we keep in our back pocket\n\n3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:39.240\n for later.\n\n3:01:39.240 --> 3:01:42.280\n So, Blueprint for Armageddon, the first World War series\n\n3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:44.840\n we did, that was in my back pocket the whole time.\n\n3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:47.320\n And when the centennial of the war happened,\n\n3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:50.400\n it just seemed to be the likely time to bring out what was.\n\n3:01:50.400 --> 3:01:51.800\n That was a hell of a series.\n\n3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:53.240\n That's probably one of my favorite series.\n\n3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:54.600\n Take my rear end, man.\n\n3:01:54.600 --> 3:01:55.440\n I have to tell you.\n\n3:01:55.440 --> 3:01:56.280\n Psychologically, you mean?\n\n3:01:56.280 --> 3:01:58.660\n Well, just, you know, when you get to these,\n\n3:01:58.660 --> 3:02:01.640\n I think, I'm guessing here, I think it's 26 hours,\n\n3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:02.840\n all pieces together.\n\n3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:05.360\n Think about, and we don't do scripts.\n\n3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:06.560\n It's improvised.\n\n3:02:06.560 --> 3:02:10.320\n So, think about what, I had somebody write on Twitter\n\n3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:13.200\n just yesterday saying, he said something like,\n\n3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:14.760\n I'm not seeing the dedication here.\n\n3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:16.760\n You're only getting 2.5 shows out a year.\n\n3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:20.380\n And I wanted to say, man, you have no idea what,\n\n3:02:20.380 --> 3:02:22.480\n the only people who understand really\n\n3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:24.360\n are other history podcasters.\n\n3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:27.440\n And even they don't generally do 26 hours.\n\n3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:29.920\n You know, that was a two year endeavor.\n\n3:02:29.920 --> 3:02:32.000\n As I said, the first show we ever did was like 15 minutes.\n\n3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.840\n I could crank out one of those a month.\n\n3:02:33.840 --> 3:02:36.140\n But when you're doing, I mean, the last show we did\n\n3:02:36.140 --> 3:02:39.040\n on the fall of the Roman Republic was five and a half hours.\n\n3:02:39.040 --> 3:02:41.320\n That's a book, right?\n\n3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:43.040\n And it was part six or something.\n\n3:02:43.040 --> 3:02:44.640\n So, I mean, you just do the math.\n\n3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:47.800\n And it felt like you were, sorry to interrupt,\n\n3:02:47.800 --> 3:02:51.760\n on World War I, it felt like you were emotionally\n\n3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:53.760\n pulled in to it.\n\n3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:55.280\n Like, it felt taxing.\n\n3:02:55.280 --> 3:02:56.440\n I was gonna say, that's a good thing though,\n\n3:02:56.440 --> 3:02:58.780\n because that, you know, and I think we said during the show,\n\n3:02:58.780 --> 3:03:01.880\n that was the feeling that the people at the time have.\n\n3:03:01.880 --> 3:03:03.400\n And I think at one point we said,\n\n3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:06.940\n if this is starting to seem gruesomely repetitive,\n\n3:03:06.940 --> 3:03:10.160\n now you know how the people at the time felt.\n\n3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:13.500\n So in other words, that had sort of inadvertently,\n\n3:03:13.500 --> 3:03:14.620\n because when you improvise a show,\n\n3:03:14.620 --> 3:03:16.360\n some of these things are inadvertent,\n\n3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:20.160\n but it had inadvertently created the right climate\n\n3:03:20.160 --> 3:03:24.440\n for having a sense of empathy with the storyline.\n\n3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:26.880\n And to me, those are the serendipitous moments\n\n3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:31.000\n that make this art and not some sort of paint by the numbers\n\n3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:32.280\n kind of endeavor, you know?\n\n3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:35.160\n And that's, to me, that wouldn't have happened\n\n3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:36.920\n had we scripted it out.\n\n3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:40.680\n So it's mostly, you just bring the tools of knowledge\n\n3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:44.240\n to the table and then in large part improvise,\n\n3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:45.520\n like the actual wording?\n\n3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:47.240\n I always say we make it like they made things\n\n3:03:47.240 --> 3:03:49.360\n like spinal tap and some of those other things\n\n3:03:49.360 --> 3:03:52.840\n where the material, so I do have notes about things\n\n3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:55.540\n like on page 427 of this book, you have this quote,\n\n3:03:55.540 --> 3:03:57.280\n so that I know, aha, I'm at the point\n\n3:03:57.280 --> 3:03:58.760\n where I can drop that in.\n\n3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:00.600\n And sometimes I'll write notes saying,\n\n3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:03.960\n here's where you left off yesterday, so I remember.\n\n3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:07.440\n But in the improvisation, you end up throwing a lot out.\n\n3:04:07.440 --> 3:04:10.560\n And so like, but it allows us to go off on tangents,\n\n3:04:10.560 --> 3:04:11.440\n like we'll try things.\n\n3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:12.560\n Like I'll sit there and go,\n\n3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:14.080\n I wonder what this would sound like.\n\n3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:16.900\n And I'll spend two days going down that road\n\n3:04:16.900 --> 3:04:18.560\n and then I'll listen to it and go, it doesn't work.\n\n3:04:18.560 --> 3:04:20.840\n But that's, you know, like writers do this all the time.\n\n3:04:20.840 --> 3:04:22.280\n It's called killing your babies, right?\n\n3:04:22.280 --> 3:04:24.600\n You got, can't, you know, but people go,\n\n3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:26.400\n so this guy goes, I'm not seeing the dedication.\n\n3:04:26.400 --> 3:04:28.920\n He has no idea how many things we're throwing out.\n\n3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:30.720\n I did an hour and a half,\n\n3:04:30.720 --> 3:04:32.560\n I had an hour and a half into The Current Show\n\n3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:34.440\n about two months ago.\n\n3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:36.280\n And I listened to it and I just went, you know what?\n\n3:04:36.280 --> 3:04:37.120\n It's not right.\n\n3:04:37.120 --> 3:04:37.940\n Boom, out the window.\n\n3:04:37.940 --> 3:04:41.000\n There goes six weeks of work, right?\n\n3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:42.480\n But here's the problem.\n\n3:04:42.480 --> 3:04:43.800\n Do you trust your, sorry to interrupt,\n\n3:04:43.800 --> 3:04:45.400\n do you trust your judgment on that?\n\n3:04:45.400 --> 3:04:48.400\n No, no.\n\n3:04:48.400 --> 3:04:50.260\n But here's the thing.\n\n3:04:51.960 --> 3:04:54.100\n Our show is a little different than other people's.\n\n3:04:54.100 --> 3:04:56.380\n Joe Rogan called it evergreen content.\n\n3:04:56.380 --> 3:04:59.800\n In other words, my political show is like a car you buy.\n\n3:04:59.800 --> 3:05:01.520\n And the minute you drive it off the lot,\n\n3:05:01.520 --> 3:05:03.000\n it loses half its value, right?\n\n3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:04.560\n Cause it's not current anymore.\n\n3:05:04.560 --> 3:05:07.840\n These shows are just as good or just as bad\n\n3:05:07.840 --> 3:05:09.640\n five years from now as they are when we,\n\n3:05:09.640 --> 3:05:11.360\n although the standards on the internet changed.\n\n3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:12.440\n So when I listen to my old shows,\n\n3:05:12.440 --> 3:05:14.000\n I cringe sometimes cause the standards\n\n3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:15.240\n are so much higher now.\n\n3:05:15.240 --> 3:05:18.060\n But when you're creating evergreen content,\n\n3:05:18.060 --> 3:05:20.320\n you have two audiences to worry about.\n\n3:05:20.320 --> 3:05:22.560\n You have the audience that's waiting for the next show\n\n3:05:22.560 --> 3:05:23.720\n and they've already heard the other ones\n\n3:05:23.720 --> 3:05:25.360\n and they're impatient and they're telling you on Twitter,\n\n3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:26.240\n where is it?\n\n3:05:26.240 --> 3:05:27.120\n But you have show,\n\n3:05:27.120 --> 3:05:29.080\n the show is also for people five years from now\n\n3:05:29.080 --> 3:05:30.440\n who haven't discovered it yet\n\n3:05:30.440 --> 3:05:32.880\n and who don't care a wit for how long it took\n\n3:05:32.880 --> 3:05:34.880\n cause they're gonna be able to download the whole,\n\n3:05:34.880 --> 3:05:36.840\n and all they care about is quality.\n\n3:05:36.840 --> 3:05:40.200\n And so what I always tell new podcasters is,\n\n3:05:40.200 --> 3:05:41.640\n they always say, I read all these things,\n\n3:05:41.640 --> 3:05:44.440\n it's very important you have a release schedule.\n\n3:05:44.440 --> 3:05:45.480\n Well, it's not more important\n\n3:05:45.480 --> 3:05:47.280\n than putting out a good piece of work.\n\n3:05:47.280 --> 3:05:52.040\n And the audience will forgive me if it takes too long,\n\n3:05:52.040 --> 3:05:53.880\n but it's really good when you get it.\n\n3:05:53.880 --> 3:05:55.720\n They will not forgive me if I rush it\n\n3:05:55.720 --> 3:05:58.320\n to get it out on time and it's a piece of crap.\n\n3:05:58.320 --> 3:06:00.800\n So for us, and this is why when you brought up\n\n3:06:00.800 --> 3:06:02.480\n a Spotify deal or anything else,\n\n3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:04.160\n they can't interfere with this at all\n\n3:06:04.160 --> 3:06:07.920\n because my job here, as far as I'm concerned is quality\n\n3:06:07.920 --> 3:06:10.240\n and everything else goes by the wayside\n\n3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:12.480\n because the only thing people care about longterm,\n\n3:06:12.480 --> 3:06:15.760\n the only thing that gives you longevity is how good is it?\n\n3:06:15.760 --> 3:06:16.720\n How good is that book?\n\n3:06:16.720 --> 3:06:19.320\n If you read J.R.R. Tolkien's work tomorrow,\n\n3:06:19.320 --> 3:06:21.200\n you don't care how long it took him to write it,\n\n3:06:21.200 --> 3:06:22.720\n all you care is how good is it today?\n\n3:06:22.720 --> 3:06:24.120\n And that's what we try to think too.\n\n3:06:24.120 --> 3:06:27.120\n And I feel like if it's good, if it's really good,\n\n3:06:27.120 --> 3:06:30.600\n everything else falls into place and takes care of itself.\n\n3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:33.440\n And so sometimes to push back, sorry to interrupt.\n\n3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:34.720\n I've done it to you a thousand times,\n\n3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:36.160\n so you can get me back, please.\n\n3:06:36.160 --> 3:06:40.560\n Sometimes the deadline, some of the greatest movies\n\n3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:43.760\n and books have been, you think about like Dostoevsky,\n\n3:06:43.760 --> 3:06:46.000\n I forget which one, notes from underground or something.\n\n3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:49.040\n He needed the money, so he had to write it real quick.\n\n3:06:49.040 --> 3:06:53.920\n Sometimes the deadline creates is powerful\n\n3:06:53.920 --> 3:06:57.280\n at taking a creative mind of an artist\n\n3:06:57.280 --> 3:06:59.480\n and just like slapping it around\n\n3:06:59.480 --> 3:07:01.160\n to force some of the good stuff out.\n\n3:07:01.160 --> 3:07:02.720\n Now, the problem with history, of course,\n\n3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:05.480\n is there's different definitions of good\n\n3:07:06.480 --> 3:07:09.160\n that like it's not just about which you talk about,\n\n3:07:09.160 --> 3:07:10.320\n which is the storytelling,\n\n3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:12.000\n the richness of the storytelling.\n\n3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:15.560\n And I'm sure you're, again, not to compliment you too much,\n\n3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:18.200\n but you're one of the great storytellers of our time\n\n3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:21.040\n that I'm sure if you put in a jail cell\n\n3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:24.360\n and forced like somebody pointed a gun at you,\n\n3:07:24.360 --> 3:07:26.280\n you could tell one hell of a good story,\n\n3:07:26.280 --> 3:07:28.720\n but you still need the facts of history\n\n3:07:29.600 --> 3:07:31.280\n or not necessarily the facts,\n\n3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:36.000\n but like making sure you're painting the right full picture,\n\n3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:37.280\n not perfectly right.\n\n3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:38.480\n That's what I meant about the audience\n\n3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:39.880\n doesn't understand what a history podcast,\n\n3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:41.680\n you can't just riff and be wrong.\n\n3:07:41.680 --> 3:07:45.600\n So let me both oppose what you just said\n\n3:07:45.600 --> 3:07:47.320\n and back up what you just said.\n\n3:07:47.320 --> 3:07:49.360\n So I have a book that I wrote, right?\n\n3:07:49.360 --> 3:07:52.280\n And in a book you have a hard deadline, right?\n\n3:07:52.280 --> 3:07:54.960\n So Harper Collins had a hard deadline on that book.\n\n3:07:54.960 --> 3:07:57.560\n So when I released it, I was mad\n\n3:07:57.560 --> 3:07:59.520\n because I would have worked on it a lot longer,\n\n3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:00.800\n which is my style, right?\n\n3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:02.320\n Get it right.\n\n3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:04.600\n But we had a chapter in that book\n\n3:08:04.600 --> 3:08:07.920\n entitled pandemic prologue question mark.\n\n3:08:07.920 --> 3:08:10.680\n And it was the book about the part about the black death\n\n3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:13.720\n and the 1918 flu and all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:15.520\n And I was just doing an interview\n\n3:08:15.520 --> 3:08:18.080\n with a Spanish journalist this morning who said,\n\n3:08:18.080 --> 3:08:20.040\n did you ever think how lucky you got on that?\n\n3:08:20.040 --> 3:08:24.280\n And first of all, lucky on a pandemic, it strikes you.\n\n3:08:24.280 --> 3:08:27.440\n But had I had my druthers,\n\n3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:29.480\n I would have kept that book working\n\n3:08:29.480 --> 3:08:32.240\n in my study for months more\n\n3:08:32.240 --> 3:08:34.560\n and the pandemic would have happened.\n\n3:08:34.560 --> 3:08:36.560\n And that would have looked like a chapter\n\n3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:37.880\n I wrote after the fact.\n\n3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:39.680\n I would have had to rewrite the whole thing.\n\n3:08:39.680 --> 3:08:42.680\n So that argues for what you said.\n\n3:08:42.680 --> 3:08:45.920\n At the same time, I would have spent months more\n\n3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:47.080\n working on it because to me,\n\n3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:49.720\n it didn't look the way I wanted it to look yet.\n\n3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:51.960\n Can you drop a hint of the things\n\n3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:53.440\n that you're keeping on the shelves?\n\n3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:55.080\n Oh, the Alexander the Great podcast.\n\n3:08:55.080 --> 3:08:58.080\n I've talked around, I talked to somebody the other day,\n\n3:08:58.080 --> 3:09:00.560\n he said, do you know that the very first word\n\n3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:02.880\n in your very first podcast, in the title,\n\n3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:04.400\n the very first thing that anybody ever saw\n\n3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:07.840\n with hardcore history is the word Alexander.\n\n3:09:07.840 --> 3:09:10.080\n Because the show's entitled Alexander versus Hitler.\n\n3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:12.120\n I have talked around the career.\n\n3:09:12.120 --> 3:09:13.040\n I've done show after,\n\n3:09:13.040 --> 3:09:14.960\n I talked about his mother in one episode.\n\n3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:18.240\n I talked about the funeral games after his death.\n\n3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:19.400\n I've talked around this,\n\n3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:22.840\n I've specifically left this giant Alexandrian size hole\n\n3:09:22.840 --> 3:09:23.680\n in the middle,\n\n3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:24.920\n because we're gonna do that show one day\n\n3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:27.640\n and I'm going to lovingly enjoy talking about\n\n3:09:27.640 --> 3:09:30.560\n this crazily interesting figure of Alexander the Great.\n\n3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:33.280\n So that's one of the ones that's on the back pocket list.\n\n3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:37.160\n And what we try to do is whenever this,\n\n3:09:37.160 --> 3:09:40.600\n we're doing Second World War in Asia and the Pacific now,\n\n3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:43.480\n I'm on part five, whenever the heck we finish this,\n\n3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:46.160\n the tendency is to then pick a very different period\n\n3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:49.120\n because we've had it and the audience has had it.\n\n3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:49.960\n So it's time.\n\n3:09:49.960 --> 3:09:53.200\n So I will eventually get to the Alexander saga.\n\n3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:57.920\n What about just one last kind of little part of this is,\n\n3:09:57.920 --> 3:10:00.600\n what about the other half of that first 10 minute,\n\n3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:02.360\n 15 minute episode?\n\n3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:05.040\n Which is, so you've done quite a bit about the World War.\n\n3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:07.720\n You've done quite a bit about Germany.\n\n3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:12.400\n Will you ever think about doing Hitler and the Man?\n\n3:10:12.400 --> 3:10:14.800\n It's funny because I talked earlier\n\n3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:16.440\n about how I don't like to go back to the old shows\n\n3:10:16.440 --> 3:10:18.040\n cause our standards have changed so much.\n\n3:10:18.040 --> 3:10:19.640\n Well, a long time ago,\n\n3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:24.480\n one of my standards for not getting five hour podcasts done\n\n3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:27.160\n or not getting too deeply into them\n\n3:10:27.160 --> 3:10:29.960\n was to flip around the interesting points.\n\n3:10:29.960 --> 3:10:32.280\n We didn't realize we were gonna get an audience\n\n3:10:32.280 --> 3:10:34.520\n that wanted the actual history.\n\n3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:36.400\n We thought we could just go with,\n\n3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:38.120\n assume the audience knew the details\n\n3:10:38.120 --> 3:10:39.440\n and just talk about the weird stuff\n\n3:10:39.440 --> 3:10:41.720\n that only makes up one part of the show now.\n\n3:10:41.720 --> 3:10:44.640\n So we did a show called Nazi tidbits.\n\n3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:46.760\n And it was just little things about,\n\n3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:47.960\n you know, it's totally out of date now.\n\n3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:49.240\n Like, you know, you can still buy them,\n\n3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:50.440\n but they're out of date.\n\n3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:53.720\n Where we dealt a little with it.\n\n3:10:53.720 --> 3:10:54.920\n You know, it would be interesting,\n\n3:10:54.920 --> 3:10:56.240\n but I'll give you another example.\n\n3:10:56.240 --> 3:10:59.400\n I mean, history is not stagnant, as you know.\n\n3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:02.120\n And we had talked about Stalin earlier\n\n3:11:02.120 --> 3:11:04.600\n and Ghost of the Ostfront was done years ago.\n\n3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:06.660\n And people will write me from Russia now and say,\n\n3:11:06.660 --> 3:11:09.520\n well, your portrayal of Stalin is totally out of,\n\n3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:13.520\n out of, it's outdated because there's all this new stuff\n\n3:11:13.520 --> 3:11:15.080\n from the former Soviet Union.\n\n3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:18.120\n And you do, you turn around and you go, okay, they're right.\n\n3:11:18.120 --> 3:11:21.600\n And so when you talk about Hitler,\n\n3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:23.160\n it's very interesting to think about\n\n3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:24.800\n how I would do a Hitler show today\n\n3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:27.600\n versus how I did one 10 years ago.\n\n3:11:27.600 --> 3:11:28.680\n And you would think, well, what's new?\n\n3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:30.600\n I mean, it happens a lot, but there's lots of new stuff\n\n3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:31.880\n and there's lots of new scholarship.\n\n3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:34.680\n And so, yeah, I would think that would be\n\n3:11:34.680 --> 3:11:36.720\n an interesting one to do someday.\n\n3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:37.840\n I haven't thought about that.\n\n3:11:37.840 --> 3:11:39.520\n That's not in the back pocket,\n\n3:11:39.520 --> 3:11:40.960\n but yeah, that'd be interesting.\n\n3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:42.880\n I have a disproportionate amount of power\n\n3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:46.320\n because I trapped you somehow in a room and,\n\n3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:47.140\n and thereby.\n\n3:11:47.140 --> 3:11:47.980\n During a pandemic.\n\n3:11:47.980 --> 3:11:49.120\n During a pandemic.\n\n3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:51.860\n So like my hope will be stuck in your head,\n\n3:11:51.860 --> 3:11:53.280\n but after Alexander the Great,\n\n3:11:53.280 --> 3:11:55.960\n which would be an amazing podcast,\n\n3:11:55.960 --> 3:11:59.560\n I hope you do give a return to Hitler,\n\n3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:03.640\n The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, which to me,\n\n3:12:04.960 --> 3:12:06.680\n It's a contemporary book, basically.\n\n3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:07.520\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:08.840\n And I, exactly.\n\n3:12:08.840 --> 3:12:10.080\n It's by a person who was there.\n\n3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:11.360\n Shira, yeah.\n\n3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:16.240\n I really loved that study of the man of Hitler.\n\n3:12:16.240 --> 3:12:20.280\n And I would love to hear your study\n\n3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:21.760\n of certain aspects of it.\n\n3:12:21.760 --> 3:12:23.840\n Perhaps even an episode that's like more focused\n\n3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:25.660\n on a very particular period.\n\n3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:30.880\n I just feel like you can tell a story that it's funny.\n\n3:12:30.880 --> 3:12:32.600\n Hitler is one of the most studied people.\n\n3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:35.880\n And I still feel like all the stories\n\n3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:38.000\n or most of the stories haven't been told.\n\n3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.400\n Oh, and there's, listen, I've got three books at home.\n\n3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:42.040\n I'm on all the publishers lists now.\n\n3:12:42.040 --> 3:12:43.860\n And they just, there's young Hitler,\n\n3:12:43.860 --> 3:12:45.040\n there's this Hitler, there's that.\n\n3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:46.160\n I mean, I've been reading these books\n\n3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:47.220\n and I've read about Hitler.\n\n3:12:47.220 --> 3:12:48.800\n I read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\n\n3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:51.200\n My mother thought I needed to go to a psychologist\n\n3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:53.400\n because I read it when I was six.\n\n3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:55.640\n And she said, there's something wrong with the boy.\n\n3:12:55.640 --> 3:12:58.080\n And, but, but she was right.\n\n3:12:58.080 --> 3:12:59.520\n She was absolutely right.\n\n3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:01.240\n But, but you would think that,\n\n3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:04.220\n that something like that is pretty established fact.\n\n3:13:04.220 --> 3:13:06.280\n And yet there's new stuff coming out all the time.\n\n3:13:06.280 --> 3:13:07.640\n And needless to say,\n\n3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:10.280\n Germany's been investigating this guy forever.\n\n3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:13.120\n And sometimes it takes years to get the translations.\n\n3:13:13.120 --> 3:13:15.200\n I took five years of German in school.\n\n3:13:15.200 --> 3:13:16.920\n I can't read any of it.\n\n3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:20.080\n So, I mean, and he is,\n\n3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:22.080\n when you talk about fascinating figures,\n\n3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:26.060\n he's so, the whole thing is so twistedly weird.\n\n3:13:26.060 --> 3:13:28.200\n There was a, it came out a couple of years ago.\n\n3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:31.460\n Somebody found a tape of him talking to,\n\n3:13:31.460 --> 3:13:34.460\n I want to say it was General,\n\n3:13:34.460 --> 3:13:36.580\n the Finnish General Mannerheim, right?\n\n3:13:36.580 --> 3:13:39.580\n And he's just in a very normal conversation\n\n3:13:39.580 --> 3:13:41.160\n of the sort we're having now.\n\n3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:42.360\n And, you know, the Hitler tapes,\n\n3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:44.420\n when you hear him normally he's ranting and raving.\n\n3:13:44.420 --> 3:13:46.040\n But this was a very sedate.\n\n3:13:46.040 --> 3:13:47.820\n And I wish I'd understood the German well enough\n\n3:13:47.820 --> 3:13:48.860\n to really get a feel,\n\n3:13:48.860 --> 3:13:51.300\n because I was reading what Germans said.\n\n3:13:51.300 --> 3:13:55.060\n And they say, wow, you can really hear the Southern accent.\n\n3:13:55.060 --> 3:13:56.060\n You know, little things\n\n3:13:56.060 --> 3:13:58.640\n that only a native speaker would hear.\n\n3:13:58.640 --> 3:13:59.560\n And I remember thinking,\n\n3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:02.300\n this is such a different side of this twisted character.\n\n3:14:02.300 --> 3:14:04.540\n And you would think you would always,\n\n3:14:04.540 --> 3:14:05.980\n you would think that this was information\n\n3:14:05.980 --> 3:14:08.740\n that was out in the rise and fall of the Third Reich,\n\n3:14:08.740 --> 3:14:09.740\n but it wasn't.\n\n3:14:09.740 --> 3:14:12.980\n And so this goes along with that stuff\n\n3:14:12.980 --> 3:14:14.860\n about new stuff coming out all the time.\n\n3:14:14.860 --> 3:14:16.820\n Alexander, new stuff coming out all the time.\n\n3:14:16.820 --> 3:14:17.660\n Really?\n\n3:14:17.660 --> 3:14:20.180\n Well, at least interpretations rather than factual data.\n\n3:14:20.180 --> 3:14:21.700\n And those color your,\n\n3:14:21.700 --> 3:14:23.380\n those give depth to your understanding.\n\n3:14:23.380 --> 3:14:26.020\n Yes, and you want that because of the historiography.\n\n3:14:26.020 --> 3:14:27.700\n People love that.\n\n3:14:27.700 --> 3:14:31.000\n And that was a byproduct of my lack of credentials,\n\n3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:34.020\n where we thought we're gonna bring in the historians,\n\n3:14:34.020 --> 3:14:36.100\n and we call them audio footnotes,\n\n3:14:36.100 --> 3:14:38.400\n right away for me to say, listen, I'm not a historian,\n\n3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:41.060\n but I'll quote this guy who is so you can trust him.\n\n3:14:41.060 --> 3:14:42.680\n But then we would quote other people\n\n3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:44.360\n who had different views.\n\n3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:46.380\n And people didn't realize that, you know,\n\n3:14:46.380 --> 3:14:47.900\n if they're not history majors,\n\n3:14:47.900 --> 3:14:49.860\n that historians don't always agree on this stuff\n\n3:14:49.860 --> 3:14:52.260\n and that they have disagreements and they love that.\n\n3:14:52.260 --> 3:14:55.660\n So I love the fact that there's more stuff out there\n\n3:14:55.660 --> 3:14:58.820\n because it allows us to then bring in other points of view\n\n3:14:58.820 --> 3:15:00.820\n and sort of maybe three dimensionalize\n\n3:15:00.820 --> 3:15:03.220\n or flesh out the story a little bit more.\n\n3:15:04.220 --> 3:15:05.100\n Two last questions.\n\n3:15:05.100 --> 3:15:07.900\n One really simple, one absurdly ridiculous,\n\n3:15:07.900 --> 3:15:09.380\n and perhaps also simple.\n\n3:15:10.260 --> 3:15:13.460\n First, who has been and is he real?\n\n3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:17.260\n I don't even know what you're talking about.\n\n3:15:17.260 --> 3:15:18.380\n Very well.\n\n3:15:18.380 --> 3:15:20.300\n How's that for an answer?\n\n3:15:20.300 --> 3:15:22.360\n It's like asking me, is Harvey the White Rabbit real?\n\n3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:23.580\n I don't know.\n\n3:15:23.580 --> 3:15:25.320\n There's carrots all around the production room,\n\n3:15:25.320 --> 3:15:27.020\n but I don't know what that means.\n\n3:15:27.020 --> 3:15:30.180\n Well, a lot of people demanded that I prove,\n\n3:15:30.180 --> 3:15:32.460\n I somehow figure out a way to prove the existence.\n\n3:15:32.460 --> 3:15:35.560\n If I said he was real, people would say, no, he's not.\n\n3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:37.580\n And if I said he was, if he wasn't real,\n\n3:15:37.580 --> 3:15:38.500\n they would say, yes, he is.\n\n3:15:38.500 --> 3:15:42.220\n So it's a Santa Claus Easter bunny kind of vibe there.\n\n3:15:42.220 --> 3:15:43.220\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:43.220 --> 3:15:44.620\n I mean, what is real anyway?\n\n3:15:44.620 --> 3:15:47.380\n That's exactly what I told him if he exists.\n\n3:15:48.600 --> 3:15:49.440\n Okay.\n\n3:15:49.440 --> 3:15:51.740\n The most absurd question, I'm very sorry.\n\n3:15:51.740 --> 3:15:53.420\n Very sorry, but then again, I'm not.\n\n3:15:53.420 --> 3:15:55.980\n What's the meaning of it all?\n\n3:15:55.980 --> 3:16:00.660\n You study history, human history.\n\n3:16:03.140 --> 3:16:06.060\n Have you been able to make sense of why the hell\n\n3:16:06.060 --> 3:16:08.500\n we're here on this spinning rock?\n\n3:16:08.500 --> 3:16:09.940\n Does any of it even make sense?\n\n3:16:09.940 --> 3:16:11.780\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n3:16:13.460 --> 3:16:16.440\n What I look at sometimes that I find interesting\n\n3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:20.780\n is certain consistencies that we have over time.\n\n3:16:20.780 --> 3:16:24.700\n History doesn't repeat, but it has a constant,\n\n3:16:24.700 --> 3:16:26.660\n and the constant is us.\n\n3:16:26.660 --> 3:16:27.940\n Now we change.\n\n3:16:27.940 --> 3:16:31.420\n I mentioned earlier the wickedly weird time we live in\n\n3:16:31.420 --> 3:16:33.660\n with what social media is doing to us as guinea pigs,\n\n3:16:33.660 --> 3:16:37.600\n and that's a new element, but we're still people\n\n3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:41.780\n who are motivated by love, hate, greed, envy, sex.\n\n3:16:41.780 --> 3:16:43.580\n I mean, all these things that would have connected us\n\n3:16:43.580 --> 3:16:45.480\n with the ancients, right?\n\n3:16:45.480 --> 3:16:48.020\n That's the part that always makes history sound\n\n3:16:48.020 --> 3:16:50.940\n like it rhymes, you know?\n\n3:16:50.940 --> 3:16:54.380\n And when you put the constant, the human element,\n\n3:16:54.380 --> 3:16:57.300\n and you mix it with systems that are similar,\n\n3:16:57.300 --> 3:16:59.580\n so one of the reasons that the ancient Roman Republic\n\n3:16:59.580 --> 3:17:02.900\n is something that people point to all the time\n\n3:17:02.900 --> 3:17:05.140\n as something that seems like we're repeating history\n\n3:17:05.140 --> 3:17:08.780\n is because you have humans, just like you had then,\n\n3:17:08.780 --> 3:17:12.300\n and you have a system that resembles the one we have here.\n\n3:17:12.300 --> 3:17:14.400\n So you throw the constant in with a system\n\n3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:17.340\n that is somewhat similar, and you begin to see things\n\n3:17:17.340 --> 3:17:19.580\n that look like they rhyme a little.\n\n3:17:19.580 --> 3:17:23.420\n So for me, I'm always trying to figure out more about us,\n\n3:17:23.420 --> 3:17:28.420\n and when you show us in 500 years ago in Asia,\n\n3:17:28.680 --> 3:17:30.780\n and 800 years ago in Africa,\n\n3:17:30.780 --> 3:17:32.780\n and you look at all these different places\n\n3:17:32.780 --> 3:17:34.980\n that you put the guinea pig in,\n\n3:17:34.980 --> 3:17:37.180\n and you watch how the guinea pig responds\n\n3:17:37.180 --> 3:17:40.000\n to the different stimuli and challenges,\n\n3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:44.980\n I feel like it helps me flesh out a little bit more\n\n3:17:44.980 --> 3:17:47.480\n who we are in the long timeline.\n\n3:17:47.480 --> 3:17:49.620\n Not who we are today, specifically,\n\n3:17:49.620 --> 3:17:51.380\n but who we've always been.\n\n3:17:52.260 --> 3:17:53.340\n It's a personal quest.\n\n3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:55.580\n It's not meant to educate anybody else.\n\n3:17:55.580 --> 3:17:57.580\n It's something that fascinates me.\n\n3:17:57.580 --> 3:18:00.540\n Do you think there's, in that common humanity\n\n3:18:00.540 --> 3:18:03.260\n throughout history of the guinea pig,\n\n3:18:03.260 --> 3:18:06.080\n is there a why underneath it all?\n\n3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:07.940\n Or is it somehow, like, it feels like\n\n3:18:07.940 --> 3:18:10.480\n it's an experiment of some sort?\n\n3:18:10.480 --> 3:18:11.860\n Oh, now you're into it.\n\n3:18:11.860 --> 3:18:13.260\n Elon Musk and I talked about this,\n\n3:18:13.260 --> 3:18:14.460\n the simulation thing, right?\n\n3:18:14.460 --> 3:18:17.860\n Nick Bostrom's, yeah, the idea that there's some kid,\n\n3:18:17.860 --> 3:18:21.100\n and we're the equivalent of an alien's ant farm, you know?\n\n3:18:21.100 --> 3:18:23.100\n And we hope he doesn't throw a tarantula in\n\n3:18:23.100 --> 3:18:24.340\n just to see what happens.\n\n3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:29.420\n I think the whys elude us.\n\n3:18:29.420 --> 3:18:32.900\n And I think that what makes philosophy and religion\n\n3:18:32.900 --> 3:18:34.920\n and those sorts of things so interesting\n\n3:18:34.920 --> 3:18:38.040\n is that they grapple with the whys.\n\n3:18:39.280 --> 3:18:44.280\n But I'm not wise enough to propose a theory\n\n3:18:44.280 --> 3:18:46.840\n in myself, but I'm interested enough\n\n3:18:46.840 --> 3:18:48.560\n to read all the other ones out there.\n\n3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:51.520\n So let's put it this way.\n\n3:18:51.520 --> 3:18:53.560\n I don't think there's any definitive why\n\n3:18:53.560 --> 3:18:54.660\n that's been agreed upon,\n\n3:18:54.660 --> 3:18:56.760\n but the various theories are fascinating.\n\n3:18:56.760 --> 3:18:59.400\n Yeah, whatever it is, whoever the kid is\n\n3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:03.360\n that created this thing, the ant farm,\n\n3:19:03.360 --> 3:19:05.140\n it's kind of interesting.\n\n3:19:06.080 --> 3:19:08.240\n Well, so far, a little bit twisted\n\n3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:09.800\n and perverted and sadistic, maybe.\n\n3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:12.120\n That's what makes it fun, I think.\n\n3:19:12.120 --> 3:19:13.960\n But then again, that's the Russian perspective.\n\n3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:15.140\n I was just gonna say.\n\n3:19:15.140 --> 3:19:18.840\n It is the Russian perspective.\n\n3:19:18.840 --> 3:19:21.480\n That's what makes the Russian.\n\n3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:24.120\n So Russian history, one day I'll do some Russian history.\n\n3:19:24.120 --> 3:19:25.200\n I took it in college.\n\n3:19:26.840 --> 3:19:28.600\n That's the ant farm, baby.\n\n3:19:28.600 --> 3:19:31.160\n That's an ant farm with a very, very frustrated\n\n3:19:31.160 --> 3:19:34.860\n young teenage alien kid.\n\n3:19:35.920 --> 3:19:37.380\n Dan, I can't say.\n\n3:19:37.380 --> 3:19:39.400\n I've already complimented you way too much.\n\n3:19:39.400 --> 3:19:40.880\n I'm a huge fan.\n\n3:19:40.880 --> 3:19:42.880\n This has been an incredible conversation.\n\n3:19:42.880 --> 3:19:46.640\n It's a huge gift, your gift of humanity.\n\n3:19:46.640 --> 3:19:47.480\n I hope you.\n\n3:19:47.480 --> 3:19:49.160\n Oh, let me cut you off and just say\n\n3:19:49.160 --> 3:19:50.920\n you've done a wonderful job.\n\n3:19:50.920 --> 3:19:52.800\n This has been fun for me.\n\n3:19:52.800 --> 3:19:54.340\n The questions, and more importantly,\n\n3:19:54.340 --> 3:19:56.040\n the questions can come from anybody.\n\n3:19:56.040 --> 3:19:58.620\n The counter statements, your responses have been wonderful.\n\n3:19:58.620 --> 3:20:01.260\n You made this a very fun intellectual discussion for me.\n\n3:20:01.260 --> 3:20:02.100\n Thank you.\n\n3:20:02.100 --> 3:20:03.660\n Well, let me have the last word and say,\n\n3:20:03.660 --> 3:20:08.280\n I agree with Elon and despite the doom caster say\n\n3:20:08.280 --> 3:20:10.760\n that I think we've concluded definitively\n\n3:20:10.760 --> 3:20:12.140\n and you don't get a chance to respond\n\n3:20:12.140 --> 3:20:16.920\n that love is in fact the answer and the way forward.\n\n3:20:16.920 --> 3:20:18.400\n So thanks so much, Dan.\n\n3:20:18.400 --> 3:20:20.280\n Thank you for having me.\n\n3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:23.160\n Thanks for
