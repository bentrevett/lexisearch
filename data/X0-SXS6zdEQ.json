00:06.280\n in the Python community.\n\n00:06.280 --> 00:09.000\n Former physicist, current philosopher,\n\n00:09.000 --> 00:11.600\n and someone who many people told me about\n\n00:11.600 --> 00:14.160\n and praised as a truly special mind\n\n00:14.160 --> 00:16.440\n that I absolutely should talk to.\n\n00:16.440 --> 00:19.400\n Recommendations ranging from Travis Hallifont\n\n00:19.400 --> 00:20.880\n to Eric Weinstein.\n\n00:20.880 --> 00:23.280\n So, here we are.\n\n00:23.280 --> 00:25.560\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:25.560 --> 00:27.640\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:27.640 --> 00:28.760\n in the description.\n\n00:28.760 --> 00:32.400\n And now, here's my conversation with Peter Wang.\n\n00:33.440 --> 00:35.680\n You're one of the most impactful humans\n\n00:35.680 --> 00:38.280\n in the Python ecosystem.\n\n00:38.280 --> 00:40.880\n So, you're an engineer, leader of engineers,\n\n00:40.880 --> 00:42.920\n but you're also a philosopher.\n\n00:42.920 --> 00:45.160\n So, let's talk both in this conversation\n\n00:45.160 --> 00:47.320\n about programming and philosophy.\n\n00:47.320 --> 00:49.040\n First, programming.\n\n00:49.040 --> 00:51.160\n What to you is the best\n\n00:51.160 --> 00:54.080\n or maybe the most beautiful feature of Python?\n\n00:54.080 --> 00:56.200\n Or maybe the thing that made you fall in love\n\n00:56.200 --> 00:59.000\n or stay in love with Python?\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:00.880\n Well, those are three different things.\n\n01:00.880 --> 01:01.960\n What I think is the most beautiful,\n\n01:01.960 --> 01:03.960\n what made me fall in love, what made me stay in love.\n\n01:03.960 --> 01:05.760\n When I first started using it\n\n01:05.760 --> 01:10.040\n was when I was a C++ computer graphics performance nerd.\n\n01:10.040 --> 01:10.880\n In the 90s?\n\n01:10.880 --> 01:12.080\n Yeah, in the late 90s.\n\n01:12.080 --> 01:14.120\n And that was my first job out of college.\n\n01:15.160 --> 01:18.680\n And we kept trying to do more and more abstract\n\n01:18.680 --> 01:20.520\n and higher order programming in C++,\n\n01:20.520 --> 01:23.040\n which at the time was quite difficult.\n\n01:23.040 --> 01:26.560\n With templates, the compiler support wasn't great, et cetera.\n\n01:26.560 --> 01:28.720\n So, when I started playing around with Python,\n\n01:28.720 --> 01:30.480\n that was my first time encountering\n\n01:30.480 --> 01:33.600\n really first class support for types, for functions,\n\n01:33.600 --> 01:34.440\n and things like that.\n\n01:34.440 --> 01:37.200\n And it felt so incredibly expressive.\n\n01:37.200 --> 01:39.120\n So, that was what kind of made me fall in love\n\n01:39.120 --> 01:39.960\n with it a little bit.\n\n01:39.960 --> 01:42.280\n And also, once you spend a lot of time\n\n01:42.280 --> 01:44.160\n in a C++ dev environment,\n\n01:44.160 --> 01:46.200\n the ability to just whip something together\n\n01:46.200 --> 01:49.680\n that basically runs and works the first time is amazing.\n\n01:49.680 --> 01:51.960\n So, really productive scripting language.\n\n01:51.960 --> 01:55.280\n I mean, I knew Perl, I knew Bash, I was decent at both.\n\n01:55.280 --> 01:57.160\n But Python just made everything,\n\n01:57.160 --> 01:59.680\n it made the whole world accessible.\n\n01:59.680 --> 02:01.240\n I could script this and that and the other,\n\n02:01.240 --> 02:04.000\n network things, little hard drive utilities.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:05.040\n I could write all of these things\n\n02:05.040 --> 02:06.520\n in the space of an afternoon.\n\n02:06.520 --> 02:07.640\n And that was really, really cool.\n\n02:07.640 --> 02:08.600\n So, that's what made me fall in love.\n\n02:08.600 --> 02:11.560\n Is there something specific you could put your finger on\n\n02:11.560 --> 02:14.080\n that you're not programming in Perl today?\n\n02:14.080 --> 02:17.120\n Like, why Python for scripting?\n\n02:17.120 --> 02:19.640\n I think there's not a specific thing\n\n02:19.640 --> 02:22.800\n as much as the design motif of both the creator\n\n02:22.800 --> 02:25.280\n of the language and the core group of people\n\n02:25.280 --> 02:27.480\n that built the standard library around him.\n\n02:28.920 --> 02:32.160\n There was definitely, there was a taste to it.\n\n02:32.160 --> 02:34.320\n I mean, Steve Jobs used that term\n\n02:34.320 --> 02:35.680\n in somewhat of an arrogant way,\n\n02:35.680 --> 02:37.120\n but I think it's a real thing,\n\n02:37.120 --> 02:39.200\n that it was designed to fit.\n\n02:39.200 --> 02:40.880\n A friend of mine actually expressed this really well.\n\n02:40.880 --> 02:42.960\n He said, Python just fits in my head.\n\n02:42.960 --> 02:45.200\n And there's nothing better to say than that.\n\n02:45.200 --> 02:47.880\n Now, people might argue modern Python,\n\n02:47.880 --> 02:49.240\n there's a lot more complexity,\n\n02:49.240 --> 02:51.760\n but certainly as version 1.5.2,\n\n02:51.760 --> 02:53.360\n I think was my first version,\n\n02:53.360 --> 02:54.800\n that fit in my head very easily.\n\n02:54.800 --> 02:56.560\n So, that's what made me fall in love with it.\n\n02:56.560 --> 03:01.400\n Okay, so the most beautiful feature of Python\n\n03:01.400 --> 03:03.040\n that made you stay in love.\n\n03:03.040 --> 03:06.560\n It's like over the years, what has like,\n\n03:06.560 --> 03:09.520\n you do a double take and you return too often\n\n03:09.520 --> 03:11.560\n as a thing that just brings you a smile.\n\n03:11.560 --> 03:16.560\n I really still like the ability to play with meta classes\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\n and express higher order of things.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:22.040\n When I have to create some new object model\n\n03:22.040 --> 03:23.360\n to model something, right?\n\n03:23.360 --> 03:24.400\n It's easy for me,\n\n03:24.400 --> 03:27.080\n cause I'm pretty expert as a Python programmer.\n\n03:27.080 --> 03:29.800\n I can easily put all sorts of lovely things together\n\n03:29.800 --> 03:32.920\n and use properties and decorators and other kinds of things\n\n03:32.920 --> 03:34.680\n and create something that feels very nice.\n\n03:34.680 --> 03:37.320\n So, that to me, I would say that's tied\n\n03:37.320 --> 03:40.640\n with the NumPy and vectorization capabilities.\n\n03:40.640 --> 03:43.800\n I love thinking in terms of the matrices and the vectors\n\n03:43.800 --> 03:46.080\n and these kind of data structures.\n\n03:46.080 --> 03:49.400\n So, I would say those two are kind of tied for me.\n\n03:49.400 --> 03:52.720\n So, the elegance of the NumPy data structure,\n\n03:52.720 --> 03:54.760\n like slicing through the different multi dimensional.\n\n03:54.760 --> 03:56.200\n Yeah, there's just enough things there.\n\n03:56.200 --> 04:00.040\n It's like a very, it's a very simple, comfortable tool.\n\n04:00.040 --> 04:02.800\n Just, it's easy to reason about what it does\n\n04:02.800 --> 04:05.000\n when you don't stray too far afield.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.960\n Can you put your finger on how to design a language\n\n04:09.960 --> 04:11.880\n such that it fits in your head?\n\n04:11.880 --> 04:14.040\n Certain things like the colon\n\n04:14.040 --> 04:17.160\n or the certain notation aspects of Python\n\n04:17.160 --> 04:18.640\n that just kind of work.\n\n04:18.640 --> 04:22.200\n Is it something you have to kind of write out on paper,\n\n04:22.200 --> 04:24.640\n look and say, it's just right?\n\n04:24.640 --> 04:27.600\n Is it a taste thing or is there a systematic process?\n\n04:27.600 --> 04:28.800\n What's your sense?\n\n04:28.800 --> 04:31.520\n I think it's more of a taste thing.\n\n04:31.520 --> 04:33.560\n But one thing that should be said\n\n04:33.560 --> 04:36.360\n is that you have to pick your audience, right?\n\n04:36.360 --> 04:39.160\n So, the better defined the user audience is\n\n04:39.160 --> 04:42.280\n or the users are, the easier it is to build something\n\n04:42.280 --> 04:45.200\n that fits in their minds because their needs\n\n04:45.200 --> 04:47.240\n will be more compact and coherent.\n\n04:47.240 --> 04:49.160\n It is possible to find a projection, right?\n\n04:49.160 --> 04:50.920\n A compact projection for their needs.\n\n04:50.920 --> 04:54.480\n The more diverse the user base, the harder that is.\n\n04:54.480 --> 04:57.120\n And so, as Python has grown in popularity,\n\n04:57.120 --> 05:00.080\n that's also naturally created more complexity\n\n05:00.080 --> 05:01.800\n as people try to design any given thing.\n\n05:01.800 --> 05:04.120\n There'll be multiple valid opinions\n\n05:04.120 --> 05:06.240\n about a particular design approach.\n\n05:06.240 --> 05:10.240\n And so, I do think that's the downside of popularity.\n\n05:10.240 --> 05:11.440\n It's almost an intrinsic aspect\n\n05:11.440 --> 05:13.040\n of the complexity of the problem.\n\n05:13.040 --> 05:14.440\n Well, at the very beginning,\n\n05:14.440 --> 05:17.440\n aren't you an audience of one, isn't ultimately,\n\n05:17.440 --> 05:19.480\n aren't all the greatest projects in history\n\n05:19.480 --> 05:21.800\n were just solving a problem that you yourself had?\n\n05:21.800 --> 05:25.400\n Well, so Clay Shirky in his book on crowdsourcing\n\n05:25.400 --> 05:27.520\n or his kind of thoughts on crowdsourcing,\n\n05:27.520 --> 05:29.520\n he identifies the first step of crowdsourcing\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:31.440\n is me first collaboration.\n\n05:31.440 --> 05:32.480\n You first have to make something\n\n05:32.480 --> 05:34.280\n that works well for yourself.\n\n05:34.280 --> 05:37.720\n It's very telling that when you look at all of the impactful\n\n05:37.720 --> 05:40.000\n big project, well, they're fundamental projects now\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.560\n in the SciPy and Pydata ecosystem.\n\n05:42.560 --> 05:46.720\n They all started with the people in the domain\n\n05:46.720 --> 05:48.200\n trying to scratch their own itch.\n\n05:48.200 --> 05:49.720\n And the whole idea of scratching your own itch\n\n05:49.720 --> 05:51.280\n is something that the open source\n\n05:51.280 --> 05:53.640\n or the free software world has known for a long time.\n\n05:53.640 --> 05:56.800\n But in the scientific computing areas,\n\n05:56.800 --> 05:58.240\n these are assistant professors\n\n05:58.240 --> 06:00.520\n or electrical engineering grad students.\n\n06:00.520 --> 06:03.000\n They didn't have really a lot of programming skill\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.520\n necessarily, but Python was just good enough\n\n06:05.520 --> 06:06.720\n for them to put something together\n\n06:06.720 --> 06:09.400\n that fit in their domain, right?\n\n06:09.400 --> 06:11.120\n So it's almost like a,\n\n06:11.120 --> 06:13.960\n it's a necessity is the mother of invention aspect.\n\n06:13.960 --> 06:16.880\n And also it was a really harsh filter\n\n06:16.880 --> 06:20.880\n for utility and compactness and expressiveness.\n\n06:20.880 --> 06:22.400\n Like it was too hard to use,\n\n06:22.400 --> 06:23.360\n then they wouldn't have built it\n\n06:23.360 --> 06:24.960\n because that was just too much trouble, right?\n\n06:24.960 --> 06:26.160\n It was a side project for them.\n\n06:26.160 --> 06:28.120\n And also necessity creates a kind of deadline.\n\n06:28.120 --> 06:29.440\n It seems like a lot of these projects\n\n06:29.440 --> 06:32.320\n are quickly thrown together in the first step.\n\n06:32.320 --> 06:34.520\n And that, even though it's flawed,\n\n06:35.560 --> 06:38.840\n that just seems to work well for software projects.\n\n06:38.840 --> 06:41.280\n Well, it does work well for software projects in general.\n\n06:41.280 --> 06:43.520\n And in this particular space,\n\n06:43.520 --> 06:46.320\n one of my colleagues, Stan Siebert identified this,\n\n06:46.320 --> 06:49.080\n that all the projects in the SciPy ecosystem,\n\n06:50.360 --> 06:51.200\n if we just rattle them off,\n\n06:51.200 --> 06:53.040\n there's NumPy, there's SciPy\n\n06:53.040 --> 06:55.000\n built by different collaborations of people.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.680\n Although Travis is the heart of both of them.\n\n06:57.680 --> 06:59.360\n But NumPy coming from numeric and numery,\n\n06:59.360 --> 07:00.680\n these are different people.\n\n07:00.680 --> 07:01.840\n And then you've got Pandas,\n\n07:01.840 --> 07:04.480\n you've got Jupyter or IPython,\n\n07:04.480 --> 07:06.880\n there's Matplotlib,\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:09.680\n there's just so many others, I'm not gonna do justice\n\n07:09.680 --> 07:10.720\n if I try to name them all.\n\n07:10.720 --> 07:12.800\n But all of them are actually different people.\n\n07:12.800 --> 07:15.280\n And as they rolled out their projects,\n\n07:15.280 --> 07:17.560\n the fact that they had limited resources\n\n07:17.560 --> 07:19.520\n meant that they were humble about scope.\n\n07:21.600 --> 07:23.560\n A great famous hacker, Jamie Zawisky,\n\n07:23.560 --> 07:26.040\n once said that every geek's dream\n\n07:26.040 --> 07:29.280\n is to build the ultimate middleware, right?\n\n07:29.280 --> 07:32.280\n And the thing is with these scientists turned programmers,\n\n07:32.280 --> 07:33.120\n they had no such dream.\n\n07:33.120 --> 07:34.800\n They were just trying to write something\n\n07:34.800 --> 07:36.560\n that was a little bit better for what they needed,\n\n07:36.560 --> 07:37.640\n the MATLAB,\n\n07:37.640 --> 07:39.920\n and they were gonna leverage what everyone else had built.\n\n07:39.920 --> 07:42.640\n So naturally, almost in kind of this annealing process\n\n07:42.640 --> 07:46.480\n or whatever, we built a very modular cover\n\n07:46.480 --> 07:50.280\n of the basic needs of a scientific computing library.\n\n07:50.280 --> 07:51.920\n If you look at the whole human story,\n\n07:51.920 --> 07:53.680\n how much of a leap is it?\n\n07:53.680 --> 07:55.480\n We've developed all kinds of languages,\n\n07:55.480 --> 07:57.720\n all kinds of methodologies for communication.\n\n07:57.720 --> 08:00.560\n It just kind of like grew this collective intelligence,\n\n08:00.560 --> 08:04.400\n civilization grew, it expanded, wrote a bunch of books,\n\n08:04.400 --> 08:08.680\n and now we tweet how big of a leap is programming\n\n08:08.680 --> 08:10.880\n if programming is yet another language?\n\n08:10.880 --> 08:12.880\n Is it just a nice little trick\n\n08:12.880 --> 08:15.000\n that's temporary in our human history,\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.800\n or is it like a big leap in the,\n\n08:19.680 --> 08:23.120\n almost us becoming another organism\n\n08:23.120 --> 08:26.160\n at a higher level of abstraction, something else?\n\n08:26.160 --> 08:28.240\n I think the act of programming\n\n08:28.240 --> 08:32.360\n or using grammatical constructions\n\n08:32.360 --> 08:34.920\n of some underlying primitives,\n\n08:34.920 --> 08:37.520\n that is something that humans do learn,\n\n08:37.520 --> 08:38.840\n but every human learns this.\n\n08:38.840 --> 08:41.160\n Anyone who can speak learns how to do this.\n\n08:41.160 --> 08:42.440\n What makes programming different\n\n08:42.440 --> 08:44.840\n has been that up to this point,\n\n08:44.840 --> 08:49.000\n when we try to give instructions to computing systems,\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.560\n all of our computers, well, actually this is not quite true,\n\n08:51.560 --> 08:53.080\n but I'll first say it,\n\n08:53.080 --> 08:55.000\n and then I'll tell you why it's not true.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\n But for the most part,\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:58.880\n we can think of computers as being these iterated systems.\n\n08:58.880 --> 08:59.920\n So when we program,\n\n08:59.920 --> 09:04.200\n we're giving very precise instructions to iterated systems\n\n09:04.200 --> 09:07.360\n that then run at incomprehensible speed\n\n09:07.360 --> 09:08.800\n and run those instructions.\n\n09:08.800 --> 09:10.160\n In my experience,\n\n09:10.160 --> 09:12.720\n some people are just better equipped\n\n09:12.720 --> 09:16.880\n to model systematic iterated systems,\n\n09:16.880 --> 09:19.120\n well, whatever, iterated systems in their head.\n\n09:20.120 --> 09:21.760\n Some people are really good at that,\n\n09:21.760 --> 09:23.800\n and other people are not.\n\n09:23.800 --> 09:26.080\n And so when you have like, for instance,\n\n09:26.080 --> 09:27.640\n sometimes people have tried to build systems\n\n09:27.640 --> 09:30.080\n that make programming easier by making it visual,\n\n09:30.080 --> 09:31.240\n drag and drop.\n\n09:31.240 --> 09:33.640\n And the issue is you can have a drag and drop thing,\n\n09:33.640 --> 09:35.200\n but once you start having to iterate the system\n\n09:35.200 --> 09:36.120\n with conditional logic,\n\n09:36.120 --> 09:37.880\n handling case statements and branch statements\n\n09:37.880 --> 09:39.480\n and all these other things,\n\n09:39.480 --> 09:42.040\n the visual drag and drop part doesn't save you anything.\n\n09:42.040 --> 09:44.680\n You still have to reason about this giant iterated system\n\n09:44.680 --> 09:46.360\n with all these different conditions around it.\n\n09:46.360 --> 09:48.160\n That's the hard part, right?\n\n09:48.160 --> 09:52.240\n So handling iterated logic, that's the hard part.\n\n09:52.240 --> 09:54.160\n The languages we use then emerge\n\n09:54.160 --> 09:57.240\n to give us the ability and capability over these things.\n\n09:57.240 --> 09:58.880\n Now, the one exception to this rule, of course,\n\n09:58.880 --> 10:00.680\n is the most popular programming system in the world,\n\n10:00.680 --> 10:03.280\n which is Excel, which is a data flow\n\n10:03.280 --> 10:05.440\n and a data driven, immediate mode,\n\n10:05.440 --> 10:08.360\n data transformation oriented programming system.\n\n10:08.360 --> 10:10.400\n And this actually not an accident\n\n10:10.400 --> 10:12.840\n that that system is the most popular programming system\n\n10:12.840 --> 10:14.440\n because it's so accessible\n\n10:14.440 --> 10:16.920\n to a much broader group of people.\n\n10:16.920 --> 10:21.240\n I do think as we build future computing systems,\n\n10:21.240 --> 10:22.920\n you're actually already seeing this a little bit,\n\n10:22.920 --> 10:25.680\n it's much more about composition of modular blocks.\n\n10:25.680 --> 10:29.600\n They themselves actually maintain all their internal state\n\n10:29.600 --> 10:31.040\n and the interfaces between them\n\n10:31.040 --> 10:32.960\n are well defined data schemas.\n\n10:32.960 --> 10:35.880\n And so to stitch these things together using like IFTTT\n\n10:35.880 --> 10:38.720\n or Zapier or any of these kind of,\n\n10:38.720 --> 10:42.000\n I would say compositional scripting kinds of things,\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.960\n I mean, HyperCard was also a little bit in this vein.\n\n10:44.960 --> 10:47.560\n That's much more accessible to most people.\n\n10:47.560 --> 10:49.920\n It's really that implicit state\n\n10:49.920 --> 10:52.000\n that's so hard for people to track.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.400\n Yeah, okay, so that's modular stuff,\n\n10:53.400 --> 10:54.440\n but there's also an aspect\n\n10:54.440 --> 10:55.920\n where you're standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\n10:55.920 --> 10:58.720\n So you're building like higher and higher levels\n\n10:58.720 --> 11:02.160\n of abstraction, but you do that a little bit with language.\n\n11:02.160 --> 11:05.160\n So with language, you develop sort of ideas,\n\n11:05.160 --> 11:07.600\n philosophies from Plato and so on.\n\n11:07.600 --> 11:09.520\n And then you kind of leverage those philosophies\n\n11:09.520 --> 11:12.640\n as you try to have deeper and deeper conversations.\n\n11:12.640 --> 11:13.560\n But with programming,\n\n11:13.560 --> 11:17.040\n it seems like you can build much more complicated systems.\n\n11:17.040 --> 11:18.920\n Like without knowing how everything works,\n\n11:18.920 --> 11:21.320\n you can build on top of the work of others.\n\n11:21.320 --> 11:22.840\n And it seems like you're developing\n\n11:22.840 --> 11:27.840\n more and more sophisticated expressions,\n\n11:27.920 --> 11:31.280\n ability to express ideas in a computational space.\n\n11:31.280 --> 11:35.040\n I think it's worth pondering the difference here\n\n11:35.040 --> 11:38.640\n between complexity and complication.\n\n11:40.400 --> 11:42.240\n Okay, right. Back to Excel.\n\n11:42.240 --> 11:43.280\n Well, not quite back to Excel,\n\n11:43.280 --> 11:47.560\n but the idea is when we have a human conversation,\n\n11:47.560 --> 11:51.240\n all languages for humans emerged\n\n11:51.240 --> 11:55.560\n to support human relational communications,\n\n11:55.560 --> 11:57.720\n which is that the person we're communicating with\n\n11:57.720 --> 12:01.240\n is a person and they would communicate back to us.\n\n12:01.240 --> 12:05.640\n And so we sort of hit a resonance point, right?\n\n12:05.640 --> 12:07.480\n When we actually agree on some concepts.\n\n12:07.480 --> 12:10.280\n So there's a messiness to it and there's a fluidity to it.\n\n12:10.280 --> 12:11.880\n With computing systems,\n\n12:11.880 --> 12:14.280\n when we express something to the computer and it's wrong,\n\n12:14.280 --> 12:15.400\n we just try again.\n\n12:15.400 --> 12:17.520\n So we can basically live many virtual worlds\n\n12:17.520 --> 12:20.200\n of having failed at expressing ourselves to the computer\n\n12:20.200 --> 12:22.840\n until the one time we expressed ourselves right.\n\n12:22.840 --> 12:23.960\n Then we kind of put in production\n\n12:23.960 --> 12:25.920\n and then discover that it's still wrong\n\n12:25.920 --> 12:27.160\n a few days down the road.\n\n12:27.160 --> 12:30.480\n So I think the sophistication of things\n\n12:30.480 --> 12:32.520\n that we build with computing,\n\n12:32.520 --> 12:35.600\n one has to really pay attention to the difference\n\n12:35.600 --> 12:38.240\n between when an end user is expressing something\n\n12:38.240 --> 12:39.960\n onto a system that exists\n\n12:39.960 --> 12:42.520\n versus when they're extending the system\n\n12:42.520 --> 12:45.480\n to increase the system's capability\n\n12:45.480 --> 12:47.480\n for someone else to then interface with.\n\n12:47.480 --> 12:49.560\n We happen to use the same language for both of those things\n\n12:49.560 --> 12:52.080\n in most cases, but it doesn't have to be that.\n\n12:52.080 --> 12:54.360\n And Excel is actually a great example of this,\n\n12:54.360 --> 12:56.240\n of kind of a counterpoint to that.\n\n12:56.240 --> 13:00.600\n Okay, so what about the idea of, you said messiness.\n\n13:01.440 --> 13:06.240\n Wouldn't you put the software 2.0 idea,\n\n13:06.240 --> 13:07.760\n this idea of machine learning\n\n13:08.720 --> 13:12.560\n into the further and further steps\n\n13:12.560 --> 13:14.560\n into the world of messiness.\n\n13:14.560 --> 13:17.640\n The same kind of beautiful messiness of human communication.\n\n13:17.640 --> 13:19.120\n Isn't that what machine learning is?\n\n13:19.120 --> 13:23.560\n Is building on levels of abstraction\n\n13:23.560 --> 13:25.520\n that don't have messiness in them,\n\n13:25.520 --> 13:27.400\n that at the operating system level,\n\n13:27.400 --> 13:29.400\n then there's Python, the programming languages\n\n13:29.400 --> 13:30.920\n that have more and more power.\n\n13:30.920 --> 13:34.640\n But then finally, there's neural networks\n\n13:34.640 --> 13:38.200\n that ultimately work with data.\n\n13:38.200 --> 13:40.560\n And so the programming is almost in the space of data\n\n13:40.560 --> 13:42.480\n and the data is allowed to be messy.\n\n13:42.480 --> 13:43.880\n Isn't that a kind of program?\n\n13:43.880 --> 13:47.360\n So the idea of software 2.0 is a lot of the programming\n\n13:47.360 --> 13:52.320\n happens in the space of data, so back to Excel,\n\n13:52.320 --> 13:55.080\n all roads lead back to Excel, in the space of data\n\n13:55.080 --> 13:57.400\n and also the hyperparameters of the neural networks.\n\n13:57.400 --> 14:02.240\n And all of those allow the same kind of messiness\n\n14:02.240 --> 14:04.400\n that human communication allows.\n\n14:04.400 --> 14:07.760\n It does, but my background is in physics.\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:09.960\n I took like two CS courses in college.\n\n14:09.960 --> 14:13.800\n So I don't have, now I did cram a bunch of CS in prep\n\n14:13.800 --> 14:15.520\n when I applied for grad school,\n\n14:15.520 --> 14:18.160\n but still I don't have a formal background\n\n14:18.160 --> 14:19.720\n in computer science.\n\n14:19.720 --> 14:22.520\n But what I have observed in studying programming languages\n\n14:22.520 --> 14:25.000\n and programming systems and things like that\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.360\n is that there seems to be this triangle.\n\n14:27.360 --> 14:30.440\n It's one of these beautiful little iron triangles\n\n14:30.440 --> 14:32.080\n that you find in life sometimes.\n\n14:32.080 --> 14:35.640\n And it's the connection between the code correctness\n\n14:35.640 --> 14:37.440\n and kind of expressiveness of code,\n\n14:37.440 --> 14:39.920\n the semantics of the data,\n\n14:39.920 --> 14:42.520\n and then the kind of correctness or parameters\n\n14:42.520 --> 14:44.960\n of the underlying hardware compute system.\n\n14:44.960 --> 14:48.440\n So there's the algorithms that you wanna apply,\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:52.440\n there's what the bits that are stored on whatever media\n\n14:52.440 --> 14:55.800\n actually represent, so the semantics of the data\n\n14:55.800 --> 14:56.920\n within the representation,\n\n14:56.920 --> 14:59.760\n and then there's what the computer can actually do.\n\n14:59.760 --> 15:02.840\n And every programming system, every information system\n\n15:02.840 --> 15:05.480\n ultimately finds some spot in the middle\n\n15:05.480 --> 15:07.440\n of this little triangle.\n\n15:07.440 --> 15:11.120\n Sometimes some systems collapse them into just one edge.\n\n15:11.120 --> 15:13.480\n Are we including humans as a system in this?\n\n15:13.480 --> 15:15.960\n No, no, I'm just thinking about computing systems here.\n\n15:15.960 --> 15:17.800\n And the reason I bring this up is because\n\n15:17.800 --> 15:20.120\n I believe there's no free lunch around this stuff.\n\n15:20.120 --> 15:23.000\n So if we build machine learning systems\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.520\n to sort of write the correct code\n\n15:25.520 --> 15:27.160\n that is at a certain level of performance,\n\n15:27.160 --> 15:30.120\n so it'll sort of select with hyperparameters\n\n15:30.120 --> 15:32.880\n we can tune kind of how we want the performance boundary\n\n15:32.880 --> 15:37.280\n in SLA to look like for transforming some set of inputs\n\n15:37.280 --> 15:39.600\n into certain kinds of outputs.\n\n15:39.600 --> 15:43.640\n That training process itself is intrinsically sensitive\n\n15:43.640 --> 15:45.560\n to the kinds of inputs we put into it.\n\n15:45.560 --> 15:47.960\n It's quite sensitive to the boundary conditions\n\n15:47.960 --> 15:49.320\n we put around the performance.\n\n15:49.320 --> 15:52.200\n So I think even as we move to using automated systems\n\n15:52.200 --> 15:53.480\n to build this transformation,\n\n15:53.480 --> 15:55.480\n as opposed to humans explicitly\n\n15:55.480 --> 15:57.360\n from a top down perspective, figuring out,\n\n15:57.360 --> 15:59.960\n well, this schema and this database and these columns\n\n15:59.960 --> 16:01.720\n get selected for this algorithm,\n\n16:01.720 --> 16:04.880\n and here we put a Fibonacci heap for some other thing.\n\n16:04.880 --> 16:06.800\n Human design or computer design,\n\n16:06.800 --> 16:08.160\n ultimately what we hit,\n\n16:08.160 --> 16:10.640\n the boundaries that we hit with these information systems\n\n16:10.640 --> 16:14.240\n is when the representation of the data hits the real world\n\n16:14.240 --> 16:17.560\n is where there's a lot of slop and a lot of interpretation.\n\n16:17.560 --> 16:18.960\n And that's where actually I think\n\n16:18.960 --> 16:20.880\n a lot of the work will go in the future\n\n16:20.880 --> 16:23.360\n is actually understanding kind of how to better\n\n16:23.360 --> 16:26.240\n in the view of these live data systems,\n\n16:26.240 --> 16:29.320\n how to better encode the semantics of the world\n\n16:29.320 --> 16:30.160\n for those things.\n\n16:30.160 --> 16:31.080\n There'll be less of the details\n\n16:31.080 --> 16:33.480\n of how we write a particular SQL query.\n\n16:33.480 --> 16:35.520\n Okay, but given the semantics of the real world\n\n16:35.520 --> 16:36.920\n and the messiness of that,\n\n16:36.920 --> 16:38.640\n what does the word correctness mean\n\n16:38.640 --> 16:40.800\n when you're talking about code?\n\n16:40.800 --> 16:42.960\n There's a lot of dimensions to correctness.\n\n16:42.960 --> 16:45.160\n Historically, and this is one of the reasons I say\n\n16:45.160 --> 16:47.640\n that we're coming to the end of the era of software,\n\n16:47.640 --> 16:49.880\n because for the last 40 years or so,\n\n16:49.880 --> 16:52.440\n software correctness was really defined\n\n16:52.440 --> 16:54.840\n about functional correctness.\n\n16:54.840 --> 16:56.400\n I write a function, it's got some inputs,\n\n16:56.400 --> 16:57.880\n does it produce the right outputs?\n\n16:57.880 --> 16:59.280\n If so, then I can turn it on,\n\n16:59.280 --> 17:01.480\n hook it up to the live database and it goes.\n\n17:01.480 --> 17:03.200\n And more and more now we have,\n\n17:03.200 --> 17:05.120\n I mean, in fact, I think the bright line in the sand\n\n17:05.120 --> 17:06.800\n between machine learning systems\n\n17:06.800 --> 17:08.200\n or modern data driven systems\n\n17:08.200 --> 17:10.840\n versus classical software systems\n\n17:10.840 --> 17:14.320\n is that the values of the input\n\n17:14.320 --> 17:17.440\n actually have to be considered with the function together\n\n17:17.440 --> 17:19.480\n to say this whole thing is correct or not.\n\n17:19.480 --> 17:21.840\n And usually there's a performance SLA as well.\n\n17:21.840 --> 17:23.160\n Like did it actually finish making this?\n\n17:23.160 --> 17:24.000\n What's SLA?\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.440\n Sorry, service level agreement.\n\n17:25.440 --> 17:27.120\n So it has to return within some time.\n\n17:27.120 --> 17:29.240\n You have a 10 millisecond time budget\n\n17:29.240 --> 17:32.760\n to return a prediction of this level of accuracy, right?\n\n17:32.760 --> 17:35.040\n So these are things that were not traditionally\n\n17:35.040 --> 17:37.560\n in most business computing systems for the last 20 years\n\n17:37.560 --> 17:39.400\n at all, people didn't think about it.\n\n17:39.400 --> 17:42.720\n But now we have value dependence on functional correctness.\n\n17:42.720 --> 17:44.160\n So that question of correctness\n\n17:44.160 --> 17:45.760\n is becoming a bigger and bigger question.\n\n17:45.760 --> 17:48.160\n What does that map to the end of software?\n\n17:48.160 --> 17:50.520\n We've thought about software as just this thing\n\n17:50.520 --> 17:54.760\n that you can do in isolation with some test trial inputs\n\n17:54.760 --> 17:58.640\n and in a very sort of sandboxed environment.\n\n17:58.640 --> 18:00.640\n And we can quantify how does it scale?\n\n18:00.640 --> 18:02.040\n How does it perform?\n\n18:02.040 --> 18:03.240\n How many nodes do we need to allocate\n\n18:03.240 --> 18:05.120\n if we wanna scale this many inputs?\n\n18:05.120 --> 18:08.360\n When we start turning this stuff into prediction systems,\n\n18:08.360 --> 18:10.120\n real cybernetic systems,\n\n18:10.120 --> 18:12.320\n you're going to find scenarios where you get inputs\n\n18:12.320 --> 18:13.160\n that you're gonna wanna spend\n\n18:13.160 --> 18:14.560\n a little more time thinking about.\n\n18:14.560 --> 18:15.840\n You're gonna find inputs that are not,\n\n18:15.840 --> 18:17.480\n it's not clear what you should do, right?\n\n18:17.480 --> 18:20.360\n So then the software has a varying amount of runtime\n\n18:20.360 --> 18:22.280\n and correctness with regard to input.\n\n18:22.280 --> 18:24.000\n And that is a different kind of system altogether.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.960\n Now it's a full on cybernetic system.\n\n18:25.960 --> 18:27.640\n It's a next generation information system\n\n18:27.640 --> 18:30.200\n that is not like traditional software systems.\n\n18:30.200 --> 18:33.160\n Can you maybe describe what is a cybernetic system?\n\n18:33.160 --> 18:35.080\n Do you include humans in that picture?\n\n18:35.080 --> 18:38.920\n So is a human in the loop kind of complex mess\n\n18:38.920 --> 18:41.520\n of the whole kind of interactivity of software\n\n18:41.520 --> 18:44.760\n with the real world or is it something more concrete?\n\n18:44.760 --> 18:45.760\n Well, when I say cybernetic,\n\n18:45.760 --> 18:47.720\n I really do mean that the software itself\n\n18:47.720 --> 18:51.600\n is closing the observe, orient, decide, act loop by itself.\n\n18:51.600 --> 18:54.280\n So humans being out of the loop is the fact\n\n18:54.280 --> 18:58.440\n what for me makes it a cybernetic system.\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:00.920\n And humans are out of that loop.\n\n19:00.920 --> 19:01.960\n When humans are out of the loop,\n\n19:01.960 --> 19:05.240\n when the machine is actually sort of deciding on its own\n\n19:05.240 --> 19:07.680\n what it should do next to get more information,\n\n19:07.680 --> 19:09.760\n that makes it a cybernetic system.\n\n19:09.760 --> 19:11.400\n So we're just at the dawn of this, right?\n\n19:11.400 --> 19:15.400\n I think everyone talking about MLAI, it's great.\n\n19:15.400 --> 19:16.880\n But really the thing we should be talking about\n\n19:16.880 --> 19:20.360\n is when we really enter the cybernetic era\n\n19:20.360 --> 19:22.520\n and all of the questions of ethics and governance\n\n19:22.520 --> 19:24.640\n and all correctness and all these things,\n\n19:24.640 --> 19:27.200\n they really are the most important questions.\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:28.600\n Okay, can we just linger on this?\n\n19:28.600 --> 19:30.640\n What does it mean for the human to be out of the loop\n\n19:30.640 --> 19:34.120\n in a cybernetic system, because isn't the cybernetic system\n\n19:34.120 --> 19:37.440\n that's ultimately accomplishing some kind of purpose\n\n19:37.440 --> 19:41.840\n that at the bottom, the turtles all the way down,\n\n19:41.840 --> 19:44.240\n at the bottom turtle is a human.\n\n19:44.240 --> 19:45.920\n Well, the human may have set some criteria,\n\n19:45.920 --> 19:47.280\n but the human wasn't precise.\n\n19:47.280 --> 19:49.240\n So for instance, I just read the other day\n\n19:49.240 --> 19:51.360\n that earlier this year,\n\n19:51.360 --> 19:52.480\n or maybe it was last year at some point,\n\n19:52.480 --> 19:55.240\n the Libyan army, I think,\n\n19:55.240 --> 19:58.200\n sent out some automated killer drones with explosives.\n\n19:58.200 --> 20:00.000\n And there was no human in the loop at that point.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:02.280\n They basically put them in a geofenced area,\n\n20:02.280 --> 20:04.280\n said find any moving target, like a truck or vehicle\n\n20:04.280 --> 20:05.840\n that looks like this, and boom.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.360\n That's not a human in the loop, right?\n\n20:09.360 --> 20:12.760\n So increasingly, the less human there is in the loop,\n\n20:12.760 --> 20:15.520\n the more concerned you are about these kinds of systems,\n\n20:15.520 --> 20:18.360\n because there's unintended consequences,\n\n20:18.360 --> 20:22.000\n like less the original designer and engineer of the system\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:25.000\n is able to predict, even one with good intent\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.400\n is able to predict the consequences of such a system.\n\n20:27.400 --> 20:28.680\n Is that it? That's right.\n\n20:28.680 --> 20:30.160\n There are some software systems, right,\n\n20:30.160 --> 20:31.920\n that run without humans in the loop\n\n20:31.920 --> 20:32.800\n that are quite complex.\n\n20:32.800 --> 20:34.320\n And that's like the electronic markets.\n\n20:34.320 --> 20:35.920\n And we get flash crashes all the time.\n\n20:35.920 --> 20:40.440\n We get in the heyday of high frequency trading,\n\n20:40.440 --> 20:41.800\n there's a lot of market microstructure,\n\n20:41.800 --> 20:43.600\n people doing all sorts of weird stuff\n\n20:43.600 --> 20:47.240\n that the market designers had never really thought about,\n\n20:47.240 --> 20:48.840\n contemplated or intended.\n\n20:48.840 --> 20:50.680\n So when we run these full on systems\n\n20:50.680 --> 20:52.840\n with these automated trading bots,\n\n20:52.840 --> 20:55.440\n now they become automated killer drones\n\n20:55.440 --> 20:57.280\n and then all sorts of other stuff.\n\n20:57.280 --> 20:59.560\n We are, that's what I mean by we're at the dawn\n\n20:59.560 --> 21:01.600\n of the cybernetic era and the end of the era\n\n21:01.600 --> 21:02.760\n of just pure software.\n\n21:03.880 --> 21:06.000\n Are you more concerned,\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:08.280\n if you're thinking about cybernetic systems\n\n21:08.280 --> 21:10.040\n or even like self replicating systems,\n\n21:10.040 --> 21:13.560\n so systems that aren't just doing a particular task,\n\n21:13.560 --> 21:15.720\n but are able to sort of multiply and scale\n\n21:15.720 --> 21:18.040\n in some dimension in the digital\n\n21:18.040 --> 21:20.360\n or even the physical world.\n\n21:20.360 --> 21:24.800\n Are you more concerned about like the lobster being boiled?\n\n21:24.800 --> 21:27.360\n So a gradual with us not noticing,\n\n21:29.160 --> 21:33.280\n collapse of civilization or a big explosion,\n\n21:34.320 --> 21:38.680\n like oops, kind of a big thing where everyone notices,\n\n21:38.680 --> 21:40.160\n but it's too late.\n\n21:40.160 --> 21:44.040\n I think that it will be a different experience\n\n21:44.040 --> 21:45.040\n for different people.\n\n21:46.280 --> 21:49.800\n I do share a common point of view\n\n21:49.800 --> 21:51.160\n with some of the climate,\n\n21:52.240 --> 21:53.760\n people who are concerned about climate change\n\n21:53.760 --> 21:58.760\n and just the big existential risks that we have.\n\n21:59.440 --> 22:02.560\n But unlike a lot of people who share my level of concern,\n\n22:02.560 --> 22:06.200\n I think the collapse will not be quite so dramatic\n\n22:06.200 --> 22:07.560\n as some of them think.\n\n22:07.560 --> 22:09.200\n And what I mean is that,\n\n22:09.200 --> 22:12.320\n I think that for certain tiers of let's say economic class\n\n22:12.320 --> 22:14.640\n or certain locations in the world,\n\n22:14.640 --> 22:17.760\n people will experience dramatic collapse scenarios.\n\n22:17.760 --> 22:20.320\n But for a lot of people, especially in the developed world,\n\n22:20.320 --> 22:24.040\n the realities of collapse will be managed.\n\n22:24.040 --> 22:26.640\n There'll be narrative management around it\n\n22:26.640 --> 22:29.160\n so that they essentially insulate,\n\n22:29.160 --> 22:31.320\n the middle class will be used to insulate the upper class\n\n22:31.320 --> 22:35.880\n from the pitchforks and the flaming torches and everything.\n\n22:35.880 --> 22:37.000\n It's interesting because,\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.600\n so my specific question wasn't as general.\n\n22:39.600 --> 22:42.480\n My question was more about cybernetic systems or software.\n\n22:42.480 --> 22:43.560\n Okay.\n\n22:43.560 --> 22:44.400\n It's interesting,\n\n22:44.400 --> 22:46.720\n but it would nevertheless perhaps be about class.\n\n22:46.720 --> 22:48.360\n So the effect of algorithms\n\n22:48.360 --> 22:50.200\n might affect certain classes more than others.\n\n22:50.200 --> 22:51.040\n Absolutely.\n\n22:51.040 --> 22:52.680\n I was more thinking about\n\n22:52.680 --> 22:56.160\n whether it's social media algorithms or actual robots,\n\n22:57.320 --> 23:00.000\n is there going to be a gradual effect on us\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.600\n where we wake up one day\n\n23:02.600 --> 23:05.160\n and don't recognize the humans we are,\n\n23:05.160 --> 23:07.560\n or is it something truly dramatic\n\n23:07.560 --> 23:11.640\n where there's like a meltdown of a nuclear reactor\n\n23:11.640 --> 23:15.240\n kind of thing, Chernobyl, like catastrophic events\n\n23:15.240 --> 23:20.240\n that are almost bugs in a program that scaled itself\n\n23:20.280 --> 23:21.120\n too quickly?\n\n23:21.120 --> 23:26.120\n Yeah, I'm not as concerned about the visible stuff.\n\n23:26.280 --> 23:29.560\n And the reason is because the big visible explosions,\n\n23:29.560 --> 23:31.200\n I mean, this is something I said about social media\n\n23:31.200 --> 23:33.200\n is that at least with nuclear weapons,\n\n23:33.200 --> 23:34.840\n when a nuke goes off, you can see it\n\n23:34.840 --> 23:36.360\n and you're like, well, that's really,\n\n23:36.360 --> 23:37.760\n wow, that's kind of bad, right?\n\n23:37.760 --> 23:40.640\n I mean, Oppenheimer was reciting the Bhagavad Gita, right?\n\n23:40.640 --> 23:42.200\n When he saw one of those things go off.\n\n23:42.200 --> 23:45.160\n So we can see nukes are really bad.\n\n23:45.160 --> 23:48.000\n He's not reciting anything about Twitter.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:51.160\n Well, but right, but then when you have social media,\n\n23:51.160 --> 23:54.400\n when you have all these different things that conspire\n\n23:54.400 --> 23:57.120\n to create a layer of virtual experience for people\n\n23:57.120 --> 24:00.960\n that alienates them from reality and from each other,\n\n24:00.960 --> 24:03.840\n that's very pernicious, that's impossible to see, right?\n\n24:03.840 --> 24:07.160\n And it kind of slowly gets in there, so.\n\n24:07.160 --> 24:09.600\n You've written about this idea of virtuality\n\n24:09.600 --> 24:14.120\n on this topic, which you define as the subjective phenomenon\n\n24:14.120 --> 24:17.800\n of knowingly engaging with virtual sensation and perception\n\n24:17.800 --> 24:19.920\n and suspending or forgetting the context\n\n24:19.920 --> 24:22.040\n that it's simulacrum.\n\n24:22.040 --> 24:26.440\n So let me ask, what is real?\n\n24:26.440 --> 24:30.440\n Is there a hard line between reality and virtuality?\n\n24:30.440 --> 24:33.440\n Like perception drifts from some kind of physical reality.\n\n24:33.440 --> 24:36.120\n We have to kind of have a sense of what is the line\n\n24:36.120 --> 24:37.640\n that's too, we've gone too far.\n\n24:37.640 --> 24:38.760\n Right, right.\n\n24:38.760 --> 24:42.640\n For me, it's not about any hard line about physical reality\n\n24:42.640 --> 24:46.200\n as much as a simple question of,\n\n24:47.160 --> 24:51.560\n does the particular technology help people connect\n\n24:51.560 --> 24:54.400\n in a more integral way with other people,\n\n24:54.400 --> 24:56.000\n with their environment,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.560\n with all of the full spectrum of things around them?\n\n24:58.560 --> 25:00.880\n So it's less about, oh, this is a virtual thing\n\n25:00.880 --> 25:03.000\n and this is a hard real thing,\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.760\n more about when we create virtual representations\n\n25:05.760 --> 25:09.360\n of the real things, always some things\n\n25:09.360 --> 25:10.760\n are lost in translation.\n\n25:10.760 --> 25:14.320\n Usually many, many dimensions are lost in translation.\n\n25:14.320 --> 25:16.840\n We're now coming to almost two years of COVID,\n\n25:16.840 --> 25:17.920\n people on Zoom all the time.\n\n25:17.920 --> 25:19.760\n You know it's different when you meet somebody in person\n\n25:19.760 --> 25:20.600\n than when you see them on,\n\n25:20.600 --> 25:22.560\n I've seen you on YouTube lots, right?\n\n25:22.560 --> 25:24.200\n But then seeing a person is very different.\n\n25:24.200 --> 25:29.200\n And so I think when we engage in virtual experiences\n\n25:29.760 --> 25:31.680\n all the time, and we only do that,\n\n25:31.680 --> 25:34.280\n there is absolutely a level of embodiment.\n\n25:34.280 --> 25:36.560\n There's a level of embodied experience\n\n25:36.560 --> 25:40.080\n and participatory interaction that is lost.\n\n25:40.080 --> 25:42.520\n And it's very hard to put your finger on exactly what it is.\n\n25:42.520 --> 25:44.600\n It's hard to say, oh, we're gonna spend $100 million\n\n25:44.600 --> 25:49.480\n building a new system that captures this 5% better,\n\n25:49.480 --> 25:51.240\n higher fidelity human expression.\n\n25:51.240 --> 25:52.600\n No one's gonna pay for that, right?\n\n25:52.600 --> 25:57.480\n So when we rush madly into a world of simulacrum\n\n25:57.480 --> 26:02.480\n and virtuality, the things that are lost are,\n\n26:02.560 --> 26:04.240\n it's difficult.\n\n26:04.240 --> 26:06.400\n Once everyone moves there, it can be hard to look back\n\n26:06.400 --> 26:08.120\n and see what we've lost.\n\n26:08.120 --> 26:10.400\n So is it irrecoverably lost?\n\n26:10.400 --> 26:14.200\n Or rather, when you put it all on the table,\n\n26:14.200 --> 26:17.160\n is it possible for more to be gained than is lost?\n\n26:17.160 --> 26:18.680\n If you look at video games,\n\n26:18.680 --> 26:22.720\n they create virtual experiences that are surreal\n\n26:22.720 --> 26:24.480\n and can bring joy to a lot of people,\n\n26:24.480 --> 26:26.680\n can connect a lot of people,\n\n26:26.680 --> 26:29.880\n and can get people to talk a lot of trash.\n\n26:29.880 --> 26:32.600\n So they can bring out the best and the worst in people.\n\n26:32.600 --> 26:35.720\n So is it possible to have a future world\n\n26:35.720 --> 26:38.560\n where the pros outweigh the cons?\n\n26:38.560 --> 26:39.400\n It is.\n\n26:39.400 --> 26:41.560\n I mean, it's possible to have that in the current world.\n\n26:41.560 --> 26:46.560\n But when literally trillions of dollars of capital\n\n26:46.600 --> 26:48.920\n are tied to using those things\n\n26:48.920 --> 26:52.840\n to groom the worst of our inclinations\n\n26:52.840 --> 26:56.080\n and to attack our weaknesses in the limbic system\n\n26:56.080 --> 26:57.640\n to create these things into id machines\n\n26:57.640 --> 26:59.120\n versus connection machines,\n\n26:59.120 --> 27:03.200\n then those good things don't stand a chance.\n\n27:03.200 --> 27:06.640\n Can you make a lot of money by building connection machines?\n\n27:06.640 --> 27:08.360\n Is it possible, do you think,\n\n27:09.280 --> 27:10.920\n to bring out the best in human nature\n\n27:10.920 --> 27:13.720\n to create fulfilling connections and relationships\n\n27:13.720 --> 27:17.040\n in the digital world and make a shit ton of money?\n\n27:18.720 --> 27:21.120\n If I figure it out, I'll let you know.\n\n27:21.120 --> 27:22.000\n But what's your intuition\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.640\n without concretely knowing what's the solution?\n\n27:24.640 --> 27:27.720\n My intuition is that a lot of our digital technologies\n\n27:27.720 --> 27:30.800\n give us the ability to have synthetic connections\n\n27:30.800 --> 27:33.040\n or to experience virtuality.\n\n27:33.040 --> 27:38.040\n They have co evolved with sort of the human expectations.\n\n27:38.920 --> 27:40.840\n It's sort of like sugary drinks.\n\n27:40.840 --> 27:42.320\n As people have more sugary drinks,\n\n27:42.320 --> 27:45.880\n they need more sugary drinks to get that same hit, right?\n\n27:45.880 --> 27:50.400\n So with these virtual things and with TV and fast cuts\n\n27:50.400 --> 27:52.840\n and TikToks and all these different kinds of things,\n\n27:52.840 --> 27:55.040\n we're co creating essentially humanity\n\n27:55.040 --> 27:57.320\n that sort of asks and needs those things.\n\n27:57.320 --> 27:58.880\n And now it becomes very difficult\n\n27:58.880 --> 28:00.360\n to get people to slow down.\n\n28:00.360 --> 28:03.520\n It gets difficult for people to hold their attention\n\n28:03.520 --> 28:07.320\n on slow things and actually feel that embodied experience.\n\n28:07.320 --> 28:11.120\n So mindfulness now more than ever is so important in schools\n\n28:11.120 --> 28:13.560\n and as a therapy technique for people\n\n28:13.560 --> 28:15.680\n because our environment has been accelerated.\n\n28:15.680 --> 28:17.360\n And McLuhan actually talks about this\n\n28:17.360 --> 28:19.520\n in the electric environment of the television.\n\n28:19.520 --> 28:22.440\n And that was before TikTok and before front facing cameras.\n\n28:22.440 --> 28:25.360\n So I think for me, the concern is that\n\n28:25.360 --> 28:28.160\n it's not like we can ever switch to doing something better,\n\n28:28.160 --> 28:32.080\n but more of the humans and technology,\n\n28:32.080 --> 28:33.560\n they're not independent of each other.\n\n28:33.560 --> 28:37.760\n The technology that we use kind of molds what we need\n\n28:37.760 --> 28:39.120\n for the next generation of technology.\n\n28:39.120 --> 28:43.360\n Yeah, but humans are intelligent and they're introspective\n\n28:43.360 --> 28:45.840\n and they can reflect on the experiences of their life.\n\n28:45.840 --> 28:47.880\n So for example, there's been many years in my life\n\n28:47.880 --> 28:50.920\n where I ate an excessive amount of sugar.\n\n28:50.920 --> 28:53.680\n And then a certain moment I woke up and said,\n\n28:54.840 --> 28:55.920\n why do I keep doing this?\n\n28:55.920 --> 28:57.680\n This doesn't feel good.\n\n28:57.680 --> 28:59.000\n Like longterm.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:02.320\n And I think, so going through the TikTok process\n\n29:02.320 --> 29:06.280\n of realizing, okay, when I shorten my attention span,\n\n29:06.280 --> 29:10.240\n actually that does not make me feel good longer term.\n\n29:10.240 --> 29:13.160\n And realizing that and then going to platforms,\n\n29:13.160 --> 29:18.160\n going to places that are away from the sugar.\n\n29:18.280 --> 29:21.080\n So in so doing, you can create platforms\n\n29:21.080 --> 29:24.000\n that can make a lot of money to help people wake up\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.280\n to what actually makes them feel good longterm.\n\n29:26.280 --> 29:28.280\n Develop, grow as human beings.\n\n29:28.280 --> 29:31.040\n And it just feels like humans are more intelligent\n\n29:31.040 --> 29:35.120\n than mice looking for cheese.\n\n29:35.120 --> 29:36.960\n They're able to sort of think, I mean,\n\n29:36.960 --> 29:39.720\n we can contemplate our own mortality.\n\n29:39.720 --> 29:43.880\n We can contemplate things like longterm love\n\n29:43.880 --> 29:46.080\n and we can have a longterm fear\n\n29:46.080 --> 29:48.080\n of certain things like mortality.\n\n29:48.080 --> 29:51.240\n We can contemplate whether the experiences,\n\n29:51.240 --> 29:53.680\n the sort of the drugs of daily life\n\n29:53.680 --> 29:57.280\n that we've been partaking in is making us happier,\n\n29:57.280 --> 29:58.320\n better people.\n\n29:58.320 --> 30:00.200\n And then once we contemplate that,\n\n30:00.200 --> 30:03.800\n we can make financial decisions in using services\n\n30:03.800 --> 30:06.880\n and paying for services that are making us better people.\n\n30:06.880 --> 30:11.440\n So it just seems that we're in the very first stages\n\n30:11.440 --> 30:15.520\n of social networks that just were able to make a lot of money\n\n30:15.520 --> 30:20.080\n really quickly, but in bringing out sometimes\n\n30:20.080 --> 30:23.200\n the bad parts of human nature, they didn't destroy humans.\n\n30:23.200 --> 30:26.040\n They just fed everybody a lot of sugar.\n\n30:26.040 --> 30:28.600\n And now everyone's gonna wake up and say,\n\n30:28.600 --> 30:31.720\n hey, we're gonna start having like sugar free social media.\n\n30:31.720 --> 30:33.280\n Right, right.\n\n30:33.280 --> 30:34.800\n Well, there's a lot to unpack there.\n\n30:34.800 --> 30:37.520\n I think some people certainly have the capacity for that.\n\n30:37.520 --> 30:39.680\n And I certainly think, I mean, it's very interesting\n\n30:39.680 --> 30:41.400\n even the way you said it, you woke up one day\n\n30:41.400 --> 30:44.160\n and you thought, well, this doesn't feel very good.\n\n30:44.160 --> 30:45.760\n Well, it's still your limbic system saying\n\n30:45.760 --> 30:47.480\n this doesn't feel very good, right?\n\n30:47.480 --> 30:50.040\n You have a cat brain's worth of neurons around your gut,\n\n30:50.040 --> 30:50.880\n right?\n\n30:50.880 --> 30:53.600\n And so maybe that saturated and that was telling you,\n\n30:53.600 --> 30:55.000\n hey, this isn't good.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:58.320\n Humans are more than just mice looking for cheese\n\n30:58.320 --> 31:00.800\n or monkeys looking for sex and power, right?\n\n31:00.800 --> 31:01.640\n So.\n\n31:01.640 --> 31:02.640\n Let's slow down.\n\n31:02.640 --> 31:05.960\n Now a lot of people would argue with you on that one,\n\n31:05.960 --> 31:06.800\n but yes.\n\n31:06.800 --> 31:08.480\n Well, we're more than just that, but we're at least that.\n\n31:08.480 --> 31:11.800\n And we're very, very seldom not that.\n\n31:11.800 --> 31:15.080\n So I don't actually disagree with you\n\n31:15.080 --> 31:18.240\n that we could be better and that better platforms exist.\n\n31:18.240 --> 31:20.320\n And people are voluntarily noping out of things\n\n31:20.320 --> 31:21.680\n like Facebook and noping out.\n\n31:21.680 --> 31:22.760\n That's an awesome verb.\n\n31:22.760 --> 31:23.680\n It's a great term.\n\n31:23.680 --> 31:24.520\n Yeah, I love it.\n\n31:24.520 --> 31:25.720\n I use it all the time.\n\n31:25.720 --> 31:26.560\n You're welcome, Mike.\n\n31:26.560 --> 31:27.400\n I'm gonna have to nope out of that.\n\n31:27.400 --> 31:28.600\n I'm gonna have to nope out of that, right?\n\n31:28.600 --> 31:32.840\n It's gonna be a hard pass and that's great.\n\n31:32.840 --> 31:34.240\n But that's again, to your point,\n\n31:34.240 --> 31:37.240\n that's the first generation of front facing cameras\n\n31:37.240 --> 31:38.680\n of social pressures.\n\n31:38.680 --> 31:43.560\n And you as a self starter, self aware adult\n\n31:43.560 --> 31:46.360\n have the capacity to say, yeah, I'm not gonna do that.\n\n31:46.360 --> 31:48.520\n I'm gonna go and spend time on long form reads.\n\n31:48.520 --> 31:50.280\n I'm gonna spend time managing my attention.\n\n31:50.280 --> 31:52.080\n I'm gonna do some yoga.\n\n31:52.080 --> 31:54.960\n If you're a 15 year old in high school\n\n31:54.960 --> 31:57.000\n and your entire social environment\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:58.240\n is everyone doing these things,\n\n31:58.240 --> 31:59.520\n guess what you're gonna do?\n\n31:59.520 --> 32:00.680\n You're gonna kind of have to do that\n\n32:00.680 --> 32:01.760\n because your limbic system says,\n\n32:01.760 --> 32:04.520\n hey, I need to get the guy or the girl or the whatever.\n\n32:04.520 --> 32:05.640\n And that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n32:05.640 --> 32:07.800\n And so one of the things that we have to reason about here\n\n32:07.800 --> 32:10.800\n is the social media systems or social media,\n\n32:10.800 --> 32:15.800\n I think is our first encounter with a technological system\n\n32:15.800 --> 32:20.800\n that runs a bit of a loop around our own cognition\n\n32:20.800 --> 32:21.800\n and attention.\n\n32:21.800 --> 32:25.600\n It's not the last, it's far from the last.\n\n32:25.600 --> 32:28.280\n And it gets to the heart of some of the philosophical\n\n32:28.280 --> 32:31.800\n Achilles heel of the Western philosophical system,\n\n32:31.800 --> 32:34.280\n which is each person gets to make their own determination.\n\n32:34.280 --> 32:37.280\n Each person is an individual that's sacrosanct\n\n32:37.280 --> 32:39.960\n in their agency and their sovereignty and all these things.\n\n32:39.960 --> 32:42.640\n The problem with these systems is they come down\n\n32:42.640 --> 32:44.560\n and they are able to make their own decisions.\n\n32:44.560 --> 32:48.080\n They come down and they are able to manage everyone on mass.\n\n32:48.080 --> 32:50.240\n And so every person is making their own decision,\n\n32:50.240 --> 32:53.720\n but together the bigger system is causing them to act\n\n32:53.720 --> 32:58.720\n with a group dynamic that's very profitable for people.\n\n32:58.760 --> 33:02.200\n So this is the issue that we have is that our philosophies\n\n33:02.200 --> 33:05.080\n are actually not geared to understand\n\n33:05.080 --> 33:10.080\n what is it for a person to have a high trust connection\n\n33:10.400 --> 33:12.480\n as part of a collective and for that collective\n\n33:12.480 --> 33:16.280\n to have its right to coherency and agency.\n\n33:16.280 --> 33:19.400\n That's something like when a social media app\n\n33:19.400 --> 33:21.720\n causes a family to break apart,\n\n33:21.720 --> 33:24.640\n it's done harm to more than just individuals, right?\n\n33:24.640 --> 33:27.320\n So that concept is not something we really talk about\n\n33:27.320 --> 33:30.160\n or think about very much, but that's actually the problem\n\n33:30.160 --> 33:33.200\n is that we're vaporizing molecules into atomic units\n\n33:33.200 --> 33:35.160\n and then we're hitting all the atoms with certain things.\n\n33:35.160 --> 33:38.360\n That's like, yeah, well, that person chose to look at my app.\n\n33:38.360 --> 33:40.600\n So our understanding of human nature\n\n33:40.600 --> 33:43.800\n at the individual level, it emphasizes the individual\n\n33:43.800 --> 33:46.360\n too much because ultimately society operates\n\n33:46.360 --> 33:47.440\n at the collective level.\n\n33:47.440 --> 33:48.640\n And these apps do as well.\n\n33:48.640 --> 33:49.880\n And the apps do as well.\n\n33:49.880 --> 33:53.360\n So for us to understand the progression and the development\n\n33:53.360 --> 33:56.000\n of this organism we call human civilization,\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\n we have to think at the collective level too.\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.280\n I would say multi tiered.\n\n33:59.280 --> 34:00.240\n Multi tiered.\n\n34:00.240 --> 34:01.600\n So individual as well.\n\n34:01.600 --> 34:05.080\n Individuals, family units, social collectives\n\n34:05.080 --> 34:06.400\n and all the way up.\n\n34:06.400 --> 34:09.400\n Okay, so you've said that individual humans\n\n34:09.400 --> 34:12.200\n are multi layered susceptible to signals and waves\n\n34:12.200 --> 34:15.280\n and multiple strata, the physical, the biological,\n\n34:15.280 --> 34:16.760\n social, cultural, intellectual.\n\n34:16.760 --> 34:19.480\n So sort of going along these lines,\n\n34:19.480 --> 34:22.880\n can you describe the layers of the cake\n\n34:22.880 --> 34:27.360\n that is a human being and maybe the human collective,\n\n34:27.360 --> 34:29.200\n human society?\n\n34:29.200 --> 34:32.920\n So I'm just stealing wholesale here from Robert Persig,\n\n34:32.920 --> 34:34.600\n who is the author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle\n\n34:34.600 --> 34:40.040\n Maintenance and his follow on book has a sequel to it\n\n34:40.040 --> 34:40.720\n called Lila.\n\n34:40.720 --> 34:42.440\n He goes into this in a little more detail.\n\n34:42.440 --> 34:47.000\n But it's a crude approach to thinking about people.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:48.920\n But I think it's still an advancement\n\n34:48.920 --> 34:51.200\n over traditional subject object metaphysics,\n\n34:51.200 --> 34:53.960\n where we look at people as a dualist would say,\n\n34:53.960 --> 34:57.200\n well, is your mind, your consciousness,\n\n34:57.200 --> 35:01.120\n is that just merely the matter that's in your brain\n\n35:01.120 --> 35:03.440\n or is there something kind of more beyond that?\n\n35:03.440 --> 35:05.080\n And they would say, yes, there's a soul,\n\n35:05.080 --> 35:09.280\n sort of ineffable soul beyond just merely the physical body.\n\n35:09.280 --> 35:11.360\n And I'm not one of those people.\n\n35:11.360 --> 35:15.560\n I think that we don't have to draw a line between are things\n\n35:15.560 --> 35:16.840\n only this or only that.\n\n35:16.840 --> 35:19.720\n Collectives of things can emerge structures and patterns\n\n35:19.720 --> 35:22.000\n that are just as real as the underlying pieces.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.680\n But they're transcendent, but they're still\n\n35:24.680 --> 35:26.520\n of the underlying pieces.\n\n35:26.520 --> 35:28.400\n So your body is this way.\n\n35:28.400 --> 35:31.000\n I mean, we just know physically you consist of atoms\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.800\n and whatnot.\n\n35:32.800 --> 35:34.680\n And then the atoms are arranged into molecules\n\n35:34.680 --> 35:37.120\n which then arrange into certain kinds of structures\n\n35:37.120 --> 35:39.560\n that seem to have a homeostasis to them.\n\n35:39.560 --> 35:40.720\n We call them cells.\n\n35:40.720 --> 35:44.560\n And those cells form sort of biological structures.\n\n35:44.560 --> 35:46.840\n Those biological structures give your body\n\n35:46.840 --> 35:49.000\n its physical ability and the biological ability\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.800\n to consume energy and to maintain homeostasis.\n\n35:51.800 --> 35:54.040\n But humans are social animals.\n\n35:54.040 --> 35:57.320\n I mean, human by themselves is not very long for the world.\n\n35:57.320 --> 36:02.200\n So part of our biology is why are two connect to other people?\n\n36:02.200 --> 36:04.920\n From the mirror neurons to our language centers\n\n36:04.920 --> 36:06.280\n and all these other things.\n\n36:06.280 --> 36:09.160\n So we are intrinsically, there's a layer,\n\n36:09.160 --> 36:12.560\n there's a part of us that wants to be part of a thing.\n\n36:12.560 --> 36:14.640\n If we're around other people, not saying a word,\n\n36:14.640 --> 36:17.140\n but they're just up and down jumping and dancing, laughing,\n\n36:17.140 --> 36:18.580\n we're going to feel better.\n\n36:18.580 --> 36:21.800\n And there was no exchange of physical anything.\n\n36:21.800 --> 36:24.840\n They didn't give us like five atoms of happiness.\n\n36:24.840 --> 36:27.520\n But there's an induction in our own sense of self\n\n36:27.520 --> 36:29.600\n that is at that social level.\n\n36:29.600 --> 36:33.560\n And then beyond that, Persick puts the intellectual level\n\n36:33.560 --> 36:35.100\n kind of one level higher than social.\n\n36:35.100 --> 36:37.220\n I think they're actually more intertwined than that.\n\n36:37.220 --> 36:41.040\n But the intellectual level is the level of pure ideas.\n\n36:41.040 --> 36:42.840\n That you are a vessel for memes.\n\n36:42.840 --> 36:45.000\n You're a vessel for philosophies.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.400\n You will conduct yourself in a particular way.\n\n36:47.400 --> 36:49.520\n I mean, I think part of this is if we think about it\n\n36:49.520 --> 36:52.200\n from a physics perspective, you're not,\n\n36:52.200 --> 36:55.080\n there's the joke that physicists like to approximate things.\n\n36:55.080 --> 36:57.500\n And we'll say, well, approximate a spherical cow, right?\n\n36:57.500 --> 36:59.640\n You're not a spherical cow, you're not a spherical human.\n\n36:59.640 --> 37:00.760\n You're a messy human.\n\n37:00.760 --> 37:04.000\n And we can't even say what the dynamics of your emotion\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:08.560\n will be unless we analyze all four of these layers, right?\n\n37:08.560 --> 37:11.760\n If you're Muslim at a certain time of day, guess what?\n\n37:11.760 --> 37:14.000\n You're going to be on the ground kneeling and praying, right?\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.960\n And that has nothing to do with your biological need\n\n37:15.960 --> 37:18.520\n to get on the ground or physics of gravity.\n\n37:18.520 --> 37:20.440\n It is an intellectual drive that you have.\n\n37:20.440 --> 37:22.000\n It's a cultural phenomenon\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.760\n and an intellectual belief that you carry.\n\n37:23.760 --> 37:28.120\n So that's what the four layered stack is all about.\n\n37:28.120 --> 37:30.360\n It's that a person is not only one of these things,\n\n37:30.360 --> 37:31.760\n they're all of these things at the same time.\n\n37:31.760 --> 37:35.680\n It's a superposition of dynamics that run through us\n\n37:35.680 --> 37:37.360\n that make us who we are.\n\n37:37.360 --> 37:39.540\n So no layer is special.\n\n37:40.520 --> 37:41.720\n Not so much no layer is special,\n\n37:41.720 --> 37:43.120\n each layer is just different.\n\n37:44.360 --> 37:45.840\n But we are.\n\n37:45.840 --> 37:48.320\n Each layer gets the participation trophy.\n\n37:48.320 --> 37:50.320\n Yeah, each layer is a part of what you are.\n\n37:50.320 --> 37:52.080\n You are a layer cake, right, of all these things.\n\n37:52.080 --> 37:54.480\n And if we try to deny, right,\n\n37:54.480 --> 37:56.580\n so many philosophies do try to deny\n\n37:56.580 --> 37:58.960\n the reality of some of these things, right?\n\n37:58.960 --> 38:01.420\n Some people will say, well, we're only atoms.\n\n38:01.420 --> 38:02.480\n Well, we're not only atoms\n\n38:02.480 --> 38:04.080\n because there's a lot of other things that are only atoms.\n\n38:04.080 --> 38:07.000\n I can reduce a human being to a bunch of soup\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:08.520\n and they're not the same thing,\n\n38:08.520 --> 38:09.800\n even though it's the same atoms.\n\n38:09.800 --> 38:12.160\n So I think the order and the patterns\n\n38:12.160 --> 38:15.960\n that emerge within humans to understand,\n\n38:15.960 --> 38:18.480\n to really think about what a next generation philosophy\n\n38:18.480 --> 38:20.040\n would look like, that would allow us to reason\n\n38:20.040 --> 38:22.960\n about extending humans into the digital realm\n\n38:22.960 --> 38:25.560\n or to interact with autonomous intelligences\n\n38:25.560 --> 38:27.520\n that are not biological in nature.\n\n38:27.520 --> 38:29.640\n We really need to appreciate these,\n\n38:29.640 --> 38:32.280\n that human, what human beings actually are\n\n38:32.280 --> 38:34.760\n is the superposition of these different layers.\n\n38:34.760 --> 38:36.640\n You mentioned consciousness.\n\n38:36.640 --> 38:39.800\n Are each of these layers of cake conscious?\n\n38:39.800 --> 38:43.760\n Is consciousness a particular quality of one of the layers?\n\n38:43.760 --> 38:46.920\n Is there like a spike if you have a consciousness detector\n\n38:46.920 --> 38:49.360\n at these layers or is something that just permeates\n\n38:49.360 --> 38:51.920\n all of these layers and just takes different form?\n\n38:51.920 --> 38:54.400\n I believe what humans experience as consciousness\n\n38:54.400 --> 38:57.640\n is something that sits on a gradient scale\n\n38:57.640 --> 39:00.540\n of a general principle in the universe\n\n39:00.540 --> 39:04.960\n that seems to look for order and reach for order\n\n39:04.960 --> 39:06.760\n when there's an excess of energy.\n\n39:06.760 --> 39:09.400\n You know, it would be odd to say a proton is alive, right?\n\n39:09.400 --> 39:12.040\n It'd be odd to say like this particular atom\n\n39:12.040 --> 39:15.840\n or molecule of hydrogen gas is alive,\n\n39:15.840 --> 39:20.680\n but there's certainly something we can make assemblages\n\n39:20.680 --> 39:24.400\n of these things that have autopoetic aspects to them\n\n39:24.400 --> 39:26.520\n that will create structures that will, you know,\n\n39:26.520 --> 39:28.640\n crystalline solids will form very interesting\n\n39:28.640 --> 39:29.960\n and beautiful structures.\n\n39:29.960 --> 39:33.000\n This gets kind of into weird mathematical territories.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.320\n You start thinking about Penrose and Game of Life stuff\n\n39:35.320 --> 39:37.900\n about the generativity of math itself,\n\n39:37.900 --> 39:39.480\n like the hyperreal numbers, things like that.\n\n39:39.480 --> 39:42.320\n But without going down that rabbit hole,\n\n39:42.320 --> 39:45.540\n I would say that there seems to be a tendency\n\n39:45.540 --> 39:49.120\n in the world that when there is excess energy,\n\n39:49.120 --> 39:51.360\n things will structure and pattern themselves.\n\n39:51.360 --> 39:53.760\n And they will then actually furthermore try to create\n\n39:53.760 --> 39:58.040\n an environment that furthers their continued stability.\n\n39:58.040 --> 40:00.800\n It's the concept of externalized extended phenotype\n\n40:00.800 --> 40:02.240\n or niche construction.\n\n40:02.240 --> 40:06.240\n So this is ultimately what leads to certain kinds\n\n40:06.240 --> 40:09.180\n of amino acids forming certain kinds of structures\n\n40:09.180 --> 40:11.120\n and so on and so forth until you get the ladder of life.\n\n40:11.120 --> 40:12.880\n So what we experience as consciousness,\n\n40:12.880 --> 40:15.560\n no, I don't think cells are conscious at that level,\n\n40:15.560 --> 40:19.560\n but is there something beyond mere equilibrium state biology\n\n40:19.560 --> 40:21.960\n and chemistry and biochemistry\n\n40:21.960 --> 40:25.420\n that drives what makes things work?\n\n40:25.420 --> 40:26.420\n I think there is.\n\n40:27.620 --> 40:29.560\n So Adrian Bajan has his ConstructoLaw.\n\n40:29.560 --> 40:31.200\n There's other things you can look at.\n\n40:31.200 --> 40:32.440\n When you look at the life sciences\n\n40:32.440 --> 40:36.040\n and you look at any kind of statistical physics\n\n40:36.040 --> 40:37.440\n and statistical mechanics,\n\n40:37.440 --> 40:40.540\n when you look at things far out of equilibrium,\n\n40:40.540 --> 40:43.400\n when you have excess energy, what happens then?\n\n40:43.400 --> 40:45.800\n Life doesn't just make a hotter soup.\n\n40:45.800 --> 40:47.440\n It starts making structure.\n\n40:47.440 --> 40:48.640\n There's something there.\n\n40:48.640 --> 40:50.880\n The poetry of reaches for order\n\n40:50.880 --> 40:52.860\n when there's an excess of energy.\n\n40:54.160 --> 40:56.040\n Because you brought up game of life.\n\n40:57.200 --> 40:59.160\n You did it, not me.\n\n40:59.160 --> 41:00.360\n I love cellular automata,\n\n41:00.360 --> 41:04.420\n so I have to sort of linger on that for a little bit.\n\n41:06.400 --> 41:09.340\n So cellular automata, I guess, or game of life\n\n41:09.340 --> 41:11.840\n is a very simple example of reaching for order\n\n41:11.840 --> 41:14.080\n when there's an excess of energy.\n\n41:14.080 --> 41:17.240\n Or reaching for order and somehow creating complexity.\n\n41:17.240 --> 41:22.240\n Within this explosion of just turmoil,\n\n41:22.440 --> 41:25.560\n somehow trying to construct structures.\n\n41:25.560 --> 41:29.760\n And in so doing, create very elaborate\n\n41:29.760 --> 41:31.560\n organism looking type things.\n\n41:32.480 --> 41:35.840\n What intuition do you draw from this simple mechanism?\n\n41:35.840 --> 41:37.840\n Well, I like to turn that around its head.\n\n41:37.840 --> 41:42.400\n And look at it as what if every single one of the patterns\n\n41:42.400 --> 41:45.800\n created life, or created, not life,\n\n41:45.800 --> 41:47.400\n but created interesting patterns?\n\n41:47.400 --> 41:48.640\n Because some of them don't.\n\n41:48.640 --> 41:50.520\n And sometimes you make cool gliders.\n\n41:50.520 --> 41:52.240\n And other times, you start with certain things\n\n41:52.240 --> 41:54.020\n and you make gliders and other things\n\n41:54.020 --> 41:57.040\n that then construct like AND gates and NOT gates, right?\n\n41:57.040 --> 41:59.240\n And you build computers on them.\n\n41:59.240 --> 42:00.800\n All of these rules that create these patterns\n\n42:00.800 --> 42:04.640\n that we can see, those are just the patterns we can see.\n\n42:04.640 --> 42:06.600\n What if our subjectivity is actually limiting\n\n42:06.600 --> 42:09.720\n our ability to perceive the order in all of it?\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:12.320\n What if some of the things that we think are random\n\n42:12.320 --> 42:13.300\n are actually not that random?\n\n42:13.300 --> 42:16.120\n We're simply not integrating at a final level\n\n42:16.120 --> 42:17.980\n across a broad enough time horizon.\n\n42:18.980 --> 42:20.600\n And this is again, I said, we go down the rabbit holes\n\n42:20.600 --> 42:22.880\n and the Penrose stuff or like Wolfram's explorations\n\n42:22.880 --> 42:23.720\n on these things.\n\n42:24.960 --> 42:27.300\n There is something deep and beautiful\n\n42:27.300 --> 42:28.600\n in the mathematics of all this.\n\n42:28.600 --> 42:30.400\n That is hopefully one day I'll have enough money\n\n42:30.400 --> 42:33.440\n to work and retire and just ponder those questions.\n\n42:33.440 --> 42:34.560\n But there's something there.\n\n42:34.560 --> 42:36.120\n But you're saying there's a ceiling to,\n\n42:36.120 --> 42:38.480\n when you have enough money and you retire and you ponder,\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:40.720\n there's a ceiling to how much you can truly ponder\n\n42:40.720 --> 42:43.000\n because there's cognitive limitations\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:46.320\n in what you're able to perceive as a pattern.\n\n42:46.320 --> 42:47.160\n Yeah.\n\n42:47.160 --> 42:51.520\n And maybe mathematics extends your perception capabilities,\n\n42:51.520 --> 42:53.840\n but it's still finite.\n\n42:53.840 --> 42:55.460\n It's just like.\n\n42:55.460 --> 42:57.640\n Yeah, the mathematics we use is the mathematics\n\n42:57.640 --> 42:59.000\n that can fit in our head.\n\n42:59.000 --> 42:59.840\n Yeah.\n\n43:00.840 --> 43:02.600\n Did God really create the integers?\n\n43:02.600 --> 43:03.720\n Or did God create all of it?\n\n43:03.720 --> 43:05.360\n And we just happen at this point in time\n\n43:05.360 --> 43:07.240\n to be able to perceive integers.\n\n43:07.240 --> 43:09.400\n Well, he just did the positive in it.\n\n43:09.400 --> 43:11.360\n She, I just said, did she create all of it?\n\n43:11.360 --> 43:12.200\n And then we.\n\n43:14.200 --> 43:15.760\n She just created the natural numbers\n\n43:15.760 --> 43:17.680\n and then we screwed it all up with zero and then I guess.\n\n43:17.680 --> 43:18.560\n Okay.\n\n43:18.560 --> 43:21.600\n But we did, we created mathematical operations\n\n43:21.600 --> 43:23.700\n so that we can have iterated steps\n\n43:23.700 --> 43:26.000\n to approach bigger problems, right?\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:29.040\n I mean, the entire point of the Arabic Neural System\n\n43:29.040 --> 43:32.600\n and it's a rubric for mapping a certain set of operations,\n\n43:32.600 --> 43:35.360\n folding them into a simple little expression,\n\n43:35.360 --> 43:38.740\n but that's just the operations that we can fit in our heads.\n\n43:38.740 --> 43:41.140\n There are many other operations besides, right?\n\n43:41.140 --> 43:46.020\n The thing that worries me the most about aliens and humans\n\n43:46.020 --> 43:50.920\n is that the aliens are all around us and we're too dumb.\n\n43:50.920 --> 43:51.760\n Yeah.\n\n43:51.760 --> 43:52.580\n To see them.\n\n43:52.580 --> 43:53.420\n Oh, certainly, yeah.\n\n43:53.420 --> 43:54.800\n Or life, let's say just life,\n\n43:54.800 --> 43:58.080\n life of all kinds of forms or organisms.\n\n43:58.080 --> 44:01.940\n You know what, just even the intelligence of organisms\n\n44:01.940 --> 44:04.160\n is imperceptible to us\n\n44:04.160 --> 44:06.600\n because we're too dumb and self centered.\n\n44:06.600 --> 44:07.440\n That worries me.\n\n44:07.440 --> 44:09.560\n Well, we're looking for a particular kind of thing.\n\n44:09.560 --> 44:10.400\n Yeah.\n\n44:10.400 --> 44:11.220\n When I was at Cornell,\n\n44:11.220 --> 44:13.860\n I had a lovely professor of Asian religions,\n\n44:13.860 --> 44:14.700\n Jane Marie Law,\n\n44:14.700 --> 44:17.760\n and she would tell this story about a musical,\n\n44:17.760 --> 44:20.100\n a musician, a Western musician who went to Japan\n\n44:20.100 --> 44:21.880\n and he taught classical music\n\n44:21.880 --> 44:24.000\n and could play all sorts of instruments.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:27.480\n He went to Japan and he would ask people,\n\n44:27.480 --> 44:30.640\n he would basically be looking for things in the style of\n\n44:30.640 --> 44:34.080\n a Western chromatic scale and these kinds of things.\n\n44:34.080 --> 44:35.380\n And then finding none of it,\n\n44:35.380 --> 44:37.520\n he would say, well, there's really no music in Japan,\n\n44:37.520 --> 44:38.800\n but they're using a different scale.\n\n44:38.800 --> 44:40.440\n They're playing different kinds of instruments, right?\n\n44:40.440 --> 44:42.620\n The same thing she was using as a sort of a metaphor\n\n44:42.620 --> 44:43.660\n for religion as well.\n\n44:43.660 --> 44:45.780\n In the West, we center a lot of religion,\n\n44:45.780 --> 44:47.980\n certainly the religions of Abraham,\n\n44:47.980 --> 44:50.040\n we center them around belief.\n\n44:50.040 --> 44:52.440\n And in the East, it's more about practice, right?\n\n44:52.440 --> 44:54.600\n Spirituality and practice rather than belief.\n\n44:54.600 --> 44:57.360\n So anyway, the point is here to your point,\n\n44:57.360 --> 45:00.820\n life, we, I think so many people are so fixated\n\n45:00.820 --> 45:03.320\n on certain aspects of self replication\n\n45:03.320 --> 45:06.120\n or homeostasis or whatever.\n\n45:06.120 --> 45:08.840\n But if we kind of broaden and generalize this thing\n\n45:08.840 --> 45:10.840\n of things reaching for order,\n\n45:10.840 --> 45:13.540\n under which conditions can they then create an environment\n\n45:13.540 --> 45:17.320\n that sustains that order, that allows them,\n\n45:17.320 --> 45:20.120\n the invention of death is an interesting thing.\n\n45:20.120 --> 45:21.480\n There are some organisms on earth\n\n45:21.480 --> 45:23.380\n that are thousands of years old.\n\n45:23.380 --> 45:25.520\n And it's not like they're incredibly complex,\n\n45:25.520 --> 45:28.560\n they're actually simpler than the cells that comprise us,\n\n45:28.560 --> 45:29.640\n but they never die.\n\n45:29.640 --> 45:33.320\n So at some point, death was invented,\n\n45:33.320 --> 45:34.720\n somewhere along the eukaryotic scale,\n\n45:34.720 --> 45:35.980\n I mean, even the protists, right?\n\n45:35.980 --> 45:37.180\n There's death.\n\n45:37.180 --> 45:41.480\n And why is that along with the sexual reproduction, right?\n\n45:41.480 --> 45:45.000\n There is something about the renewal process,\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:46.520\n something about the ability to respond\n\n45:46.520 --> 45:48.160\n to a changing environment,\n\n45:48.160 --> 45:50.240\n where it just becomes,\n\n45:50.240 --> 45:51.520\n just killing off the old generation\n\n45:51.520 --> 45:54.240\n and letting new generations try,\n\n45:54.240 --> 45:57.040\n seems to be the best way to fit into the niche.\n\n45:57.040 --> 46:00.320\n Human historians seems to write about wheels and fires,\n\n46:00.320 --> 46:01.640\n the greatest inventions,\n\n46:01.640 --> 46:04.360\n but it seems like death and sex are pretty good.\n\n46:04.360 --> 46:06.560\n And they're kind of essential inventions\n\n46:06.560 --> 46:07.400\n at the very beginning.\n\n46:07.400 --> 46:08.600\n At the very beginning, yeah.\n\n46:08.600 --> 46:10.560\n Well, we didn't invent them, right?\n\n46:10.560 --> 46:13.300\n Well, Broad, you didn't invent them.\n\n46:13.300 --> 46:15.400\n I see us as one,\n\n46:15.400 --> 46:17.880\n you particular Homo sapiens did not invent them,\n\n46:17.880 --> 46:21.000\n but we together, it's a team project,\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:21.880\n just like you're saying.\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:24.280\n I think the greatest Homo sapiens invention\n\n46:24.280 --> 46:25.640\n is collaboration.\n\n46:25.640 --> 46:27.240\n So when you say collaboration,\n\n46:29.640 --> 46:32.200\n Peter, where do ideas come from\n\n46:32.200 --> 46:35.280\n and how do they take hold in society?\n\n46:35.280 --> 46:36.960\n Is that the nature of collaboration?\n\n46:36.960 --> 46:40.440\n Is that the basic atom of collaboration is ideas?\n\n46:40.440 --> 46:43.200\n It's not not ideas, but it's not only ideas.\n\n46:43.200 --> 46:44.440\n There's a book I just started reading\n\n46:44.440 --> 46:45.920\n called Death From A Distance.\n\n46:45.920 --> 46:46.740\n Have you heard of this?\n\n46:46.740 --> 46:47.580\n No.\n\n46:47.580 --> 46:49.200\n It's a really fascinating thesis,\n\n46:49.200 --> 46:53.200\n which is that humans are the only conspecific,\n\n46:53.200 --> 46:55.800\n the only species that can kill other members\n\n46:55.800 --> 46:58.200\n of the species from range.\n\n46:58.200 --> 46:59.600\n And maybe there's a few exceptions,\n\n46:59.600 --> 47:01.020\n but if you look in the animal world,\n\n47:01.020 --> 47:03.000\n you see like pronghorns butting heads, right?\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.840\n You see the alpha lion and the beta lion\n\n47:05.840 --> 47:07.200\n and they take each other down.\n\n47:07.200 --> 47:08.720\n Humans, we developed the ability\n\n47:08.720 --> 47:10.120\n to chuck rocks at each other,\n\n47:10.120 --> 47:11.960\n well, at prey, but also at each other.\n\n47:11.960 --> 47:14.920\n And that means the beta male can chunk a rock\n\n47:14.920 --> 47:17.440\n at the alpha male and take them down.\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:20.040\n And he can throw a lot of rocks actually,\n\n47:20.040 --> 47:22.400\n miss a bunch of times, but just hit once and be good.\n\n47:22.400 --> 47:25.800\n So this ability to actually kill members\n\n47:25.800 --> 47:27.280\n of our own species from range\n\n47:27.280 --> 47:29.960\n without a threat of harm to ourselves\n\n47:29.960 --> 47:32.360\n created essentially mutually assured destruction\n\n47:32.360 --> 47:34.000\n where we had to evolve cooperation.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:37.300\n If we didn't, then if we just continue to try to do,\n\n47:37.300 --> 47:39.480\n like I'm the biggest monkey in the tribe\n\n47:39.480 --> 47:43.040\n and I'm gonna own this tribe and you have to go,\n\n47:43.040 --> 47:46.720\n if we do it that way, then those tribes basically failed.\n\n47:46.720 --> 47:48.440\n And the tribes that persisted\n\n47:48.440 --> 47:51.440\n and that have now given rise to the modern Homo sapiens\n\n47:51.440 --> 47:53.860\n are the ones where respecting the fact\n\n47:53.860 --> 47:56.240\n that we can kill each other from a range\n\n47:56.240 --> 47:58.640\n without harm, like there's an asymmetric ability\n\n47:58.640 --> 48:00.840\n to snipe the leader from range.\n\n48:00.840 --> 48:03.920\n That meant that we sort of had to learn\n\n48:03.920 --> 48:05.400\n how to cooperate with each other, right?\n\n48:05.400 --> 48:06.600\n Come back here, don't throw that rock at me.\n\n48:06.600 --> 48:07.960\n Let's talk our differences out.\n\n48:07.960 --> 48:10.240\n So violence is also part of collaboration.\n\n48:10.240 --> 48:12.320\n The threat of violence, let's say.\n\n48:12.320 --> 48:15.720\n Well, the recognition, maybe the better way to put it\n\n48:15.720 --> 48:17.480\n is the recognition that we have more to gain\n\n48:17.480 --> 48:21.140\n by working together than the prisoner's dilemma\n\n48:21.140 --> 48:22.580\n of both of us defecting.\n\n48:23.520 --> 48:26.380\n So mutually assured destruction in all its forms\n\n48:26.380 --> 48:28.720\n is part of this idea of collaboration.\n\n48:28.720 --> 48:31.040\n Well, and Eric Weinstein talks about our nuclear peace,\n\n48:31.040 --> 48:32.440\n right, I mean, it kind of sucks\n\n48:32.440 --> 48:34.040\n with thousands of warheads aimed at each other,\n\n48:34.040 --> 48:36.320\n we mean Russia and the US, but it's like,\n\n48:36.320 --> 48:39.880\n on the other hand, we only fought proxy wars, right?\n\n48:39.880 --> 48:41.360\n We did not have another World War III\n\n48:41.360 --> 48:43.520\n of like hundreds of millions of people dying\n\n48:43.520 --> 48:47.840\n to like machine gun fire and giant guided missiles.\n\n48:47.840 --> 48:50.400\n So the original nuclear weapon is a rock\n\n48:50.400 --> 48:52.280\n that we learned how to throw, essentially?\n\n48:52.280 --> 48:54.280\n The original, yeah, well, the original scope of the world\n\n48:54.280 --> 48:56.480\n for any human being was their little tribe.\n\n48:58.740 --> 49:00.680\n I would say it still is for the most part.\n\n49:00.680 --> 49:05.680\n Eric Weinstein speaks very highly of you,\n\n49:05.800 --> 49:08.000\n which is very surprising to me at first\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.800\n because I didn't know there's this depth to you\n\n49:10.800 --> 49:15.560\n because I knew you as an amazing leader of engineers\n\n49:15.560 --> 49:18.440\n and an engineer yourself and so on, so it's fascinating.\n\n49:18.440 --> 49:23.440\n Maybe just as a comment, a side tangent that we can take,\n\n49:23.800 --> 49:27.120\n what's your nature of your friendship with Eric Weinstein?\n\n49:27.120 --> 49:30.620\n How did the two, how did such two interesting paths cross?\n\n49:30.620 --> 49:32.960\n Is it your origins in physics?\n\n49:32.960 --> 49:35.620\n Is it your interest in philosophy\n\n49:35.620 --> 49:37.280\n and the ideas of how the world works?\n\n49:37.280 --> 49:38.120\n What is it?\n\n49:38.120 --> 49:40.920\n It's very random, Eric found me.\n\n49:40.920 --> 49:43.840\n He actually found Travis and I.\n\n49:43.840 --> 49:44.680\n Travis Oliphant.\n\n49:44.680 --> 49:45.900\n Oliphant, yeah, we were both working\n\n49:45.900 --> 49:48.520\n at a company called Enthought back in the mid 2000s\n\n49:48.520 --> 49:50.840\n and we were doing a lot of consulting\n\n49:50.840 --> 49:54.400\n around scientific Python and we'd made some tools\n\n49:54.400 --> 49:57.400\n and Eric was trying to use some of these Python tools\n\n49:57.400 --> 50:00.200\n to visualize, he had a fiber bundle approach\n\n50:00.200 --> 50:03.440\n to modeling certain aspects of economics.\n\n50:03.440 --> 50:05.200\n He was doing this and that's how he kind of got in touch\n\n50:05.200 --> 50:06.160\n with us and so.\n\n50:06.160 --> 50:08.160\n This was in the early.\n\n50:08.160 --> 50:13.160\n This was mid 2000s, oh seven timeframe, oh six, oh seven.\n\n50:13.680 --> 50:16.200\n Eric Weinstein trying to use Python.\n\n50:16.200 --> 50:18.680\n Right, to visualize fiber bundles.\n\n50:18.680 --> 50:20.160\n Using some of the tools that we had built\n\n50:20.160 --> 50:21.280\n in the open source.\n\n50:21.280 --> 50:24.160\n That's somehow entertaining to me, the thought of that.\n\n50:24.160 --> 50:27.160\n It's very funny but then we met with him a couple times,\n\n50:27.160 --> 50:28.780\n a really interesting guy and then in the wake\n\n50:28.780 --> 50:31.360\n of the oh seven, oh eight kind of financial collapse,\n\n50:31.360 --> 50:35.440\n he helped organize with Lee Smolin a symposium\n\n50:35.440 --> 50:39.960\n at the Perimeter Institute about okay, well clearly,\n\n50:39.960 --> 50:42.220\n big finance can't be trusted, government's in its pockets\n\n50:42.220 --> 50:45.360\n with regulatory capture, what the F do we do?\n\n50:45.360 --> 50:47.680\n And all sorts of people, Nassim Tlaib was there\n\n50:47.680 --> 50:51.300\n and Andy Lowe from MIT was there and Bill Janeway,\n\n50:51.300 --> 50:54.880\n I mean just a lot of top billing people were there\n\n50:54.880 --> 50:58.480\n and he invited me and Travis and another one\n\n50:58.480 --> 51:01.320\n of our coworkers, Robert Kern, who is anyone\n\n51:01.320 --> 51:03.960\n in the SciPy, NumPy community knows Robert.\n\n51:03.960 --> 51:04.780\n Really great guy.\n\n51:04.780 --> 51:06.640\n So the three of us also got invited to go to this thing\n\n51:06.640 --> 51:07.800\n and that's where I met Brett Weinstein\n\n51:07.800 --> 51:09.520\n for the first time as well.\n\n51:09.520 --> 51:11.680\n Yeah, I knew him before he got all famous\n\n51:11.680 --> 51:13.440\n for unfortunate reasons, I guess.\n\n51:13.440 --> 51:18.440\n But anyway, so we met then and kind of had a friendship\n\n51:19.600 --> 51:21.400\n throughout since then.\n\n51:21.400 --> 51:26.080\n You have a depth of thinking that kind of runs\n\n51:26.080 --> 51:28.600\n with Eric in terms of just thinking about the world deeply\n\n51:28.600 --> 51:31.720\n and thinking philosophically and then there's Eric's\n\n51:31.720 --> 51:33.480\n interest in programming.\n\n51:33.480 --> 51:38.080\n I actually have never, you know, he'll bring up programming\n\n51:38.080 --> 51:41.100\n to me quite a bit as a metaphor for stuff.\n\n51:41.100 --> 51:43.660\n But I never kind of pushed the point of like,\n\n51:44.520 --> 51:46.820\n what's the nature of your interest in programming?\n\n51:46.820 --> 51:48.840\n I think he saw it probably as a tool.\n\n51:48.840 --> 51:49.680\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n51:49.680 --> 51:52.200\n That you visualize, to explore mathematics\n\n51:52.200 --> 51:55.020\n and explore physics and I was wondering like,\n\n51:55.020 --> 51:59.520\n what's his depth of interest and also his vision\n\n51:59.520 --> 52:04.520\n for what programming would look like in the future.\n\n52:05.640 --> 52:08.000\n Have you had interaction with him, like discussion\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:09.840\n in the space of Python, programming?\n\n52:09.840 --> 52:11.920\n Well, in the sense of sometimes he asks me,\n\n52:11.920 --> 52:13.620\n why is this stuff still so hard?\n\n52:13.620 --> 52:18.280\n Yeah, you know, everybody's a critic.\n\n52:18.280 --> 52:20.320\n But actually, no, Eric.\n\n52:20.320 --> 52:21.440\n Programming, you mean, like in general?\n\n52:21.440 --> 52:23.320\n Yes, yes, well, not programming in general,\n\n52:23.320 --> 52:25.560\n but certain things in the Python ecosystem.\n\n52:25.560 --> 52:29.560\n But he actually, I think what I find in listening\n\n52:29.560 --> 52:31.640\n to some of his stuff is that he does use\n\n52:31.640 --> 52:33.280\n programming metaphors a lot, right?\n\n52:33.280 --> 52:35.420\n He'll talk about APIs or object oriented\n\n52:35.420 --> 52:36.400\n and things like that.\n\n52:36.400 --> 52:39.240\n So I think that's a useful set of frames\n\n52:39.240 --> 52:42.880\n for him to draw upon for discourse.\n\n52:42.880 --> 52:45.440\n I haven't pair programmed with him in a very long time.\n\n52:45.440 --> 52:47.240\n You've previously pair coded with Eric.\n\n52:47.240 --> 52:49.520\n Well, I mean, I look at his code trying to help\n\n52:49.520 --> 52:50.960\n like put together some of the visualizations\n\n52:50.960 --> 52:51.800\n around these things.\n\n52:51.800 --> 52:54.040\n But it's been a very, not really pair programmed,\n\n52:54.040 --> 52:55.800\n but like even looked at his code, right?\n\n52:55.800 --> 52:56.640\n I mean.\n\n52:56.640 --> 52:59.920\n How legendary would be is that like Git repo\n\n53:01.040 --> 53:02.680\n with Peter Wang and Eric Weinstein?\n\n53:02.680 --> 53:05.480\n Well, honestly, Robert Kern did all the heavy lifting.\n\n53:05.480 --> 53:06.880\n So I have to give credit where credit is due.\n\n53:06.880 --> 53:10.760\n Robert is the silent but incredibly deep, quiet,\n\n53:10.760 --> 53:13.480\n not silent, but quiet, but incredibly deep individual\n\n53:13.480 --> 53:14.720\n at the heart of a lot of those things\n\n53:14.720 --> 53:16.720\n that Eric was trying to do.\n\n53:16.720 --> 53:19.160\n But we did have, you know, as Travis and I\n\n53:19.160 --> 53:23.520\n were starting our company in 2012 timeframe,\n\n53:23.520 --> 53:24.640\n we went to New York.\n\n53:24.640 --> 53:26.120\n Eric was still in New York at the time.\n\n53:26.120 --> 53:29.160\n He hadn't moved to, this is before he joined Teal Capital.\n\n53:29.160 --> 53:31.560\n We just had like a steak dinner somewhere.\n\n53:31.560 --> 53:33.400\n Maybe it was Keynes, I don't know, somewhere in New York.\n\n53:33.400 --> 53:36.360\n So it was me, Travis, Eric, and then Wes McKinney,\n\n53:36.360 --> 53:39.520\n the creative pandas, and then Wes's then business partner,\n\n53:39.520 --> 53:42.040\n Adam, the five of us sat around having this,\n\n53:42.040 --> 53:45.520\n just a hilarious time, amazing dinner.\n\n53:45.520 --> 53:46.960\n I forget what all we talked about,\n\n53:46.960 --> 53:49.000\n but it was one of those conversations,\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.400\n which I wish as soon as COVID is over,\n\n53:51.400 --> 53:53.080\n maybe Eric and I can sit down.\n\n53:53.080 --> 53:53.920\n Recreate.\n\n53:53.920 --> 53:56.720\n Recreate it somewhere in LA, or maybe he comes here,\n\n53:56.720 --> 53:58.160\n because a lot of cool people are here in Austin, right?\n\n53:58.160 --> 53:59.000\n Exactly.\n\n53:59.000 --> 53:59.840\n Yeah, we're all here.\n\n53:59.840 --> 54:00.680\n He should come here.\n\n54:00.680 --> 54:01.520\n Come here.\n\n54:01.520 --> 54:02.360\n Yeah.\n\n54:02.360 --> 54:04.120\n So he uses the metaphor source code sometimes\n\n54:04.120 --> 54:05.320\n to talk about physics.\n\n54:05.320 --> 54:07.160\n We figure out our own source code.\n\n54:07.160 --> 54:09.240\n So you with a physics background\n\n54:10.880 --> 54:14.160\n and somebody who's quite a bit of an expert in source code,\n\n54:14.160 --> 54:16.880\n do you think we'll ever figure out our own source code\n\n54:17.760 --> 54:19.040\n in the way that Eric means?\n\n54:19.040 --> 54:20.360\n Do you think we'll figure out the nature of reality?\n\n54:20.360 --> 54:21.760\n Well, I think we're constantly working on that problem.\n\n54:21.760 --> 54:24.400\n I mean, I think we'll make more and more progress.\n\n54:24.400 --> 54:28.120\n For me, there's some things I don't really doubt too much.\n\n54:28.120 --> 54:29.960\n Like, I don't really doubt that one day\n\n54:29.960 --> 54:34.480\n we will create a synthetic, maybe not fully in silicon,\n\n54:34.480 --> 54:37.080\n but a synthetic approach to\n\n54:39.240 --> 54:42.680\n cognition that rivals the biological\n\n54:42.680 --> 54:44.760\n 20 watt computers in our heads.\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:46.080\n What's cognition here?\n\n54:46.080 --> 54:46.920\n Cognition.\n\n54:46.920 --> 54:47.760\n Which aspect?\n\n54:47.760 --> 54:49.960\n Perception, attention, memory, recall,\n\n54:49.960 --> 54:51.840\n asking better questions.\n\n54:51.840 --> 54:53.200\n That for me is a measure of intelligence.\n\n54:53.200 --> 54:55.400\n Doesn't Roomba vacuum cleaner already do that?\n\n54:55.400 --> 54:57.080\n Or do you mean, oh, it doesn't ask questions.\n\n54:57.080 --> 55:00.160\n I mean, no, it's, I mean, I have a Roomba,\n\n55:00.160 --> 55:03.080\n but it's not even as smart as my cat, right?\n\n55:03.080 --> 55:05.320\n Yeah, but it asks questions about what is this wall?\n\n55:05.320 --> 55:08.920\n It now, new feature asks, is this poop or not, apparently.\n\n55:08.920 --> 55:11.320\n Yes, a lot of our current cybernetic system,\n\n55:11.320 --> 55:12.640\n it's a cybernetic system.\n\n55:12.640 --> 55:14.960\n It will go and it will happily vacuum up some poop, right?\n\n55:14.960 --> 55:16.640\n The older generations would.\n\n55:16.640 --> 55:19.400\n The new one, just released, does not vacuum up the poop.\n\n55:19.400 --> 55:20.240\n Okay.\n\n55:20.240 --> 55:21.080\n This is a commercial for.\n\n55:21.080 --> 55:21.920\n I wonder if it still gets stuck\n\n55:21.920 --> 55:23.800\n under my first rung of my stair.\n\n55:23.800 --> 55:27.160\n In any case, these cybernetic systems we have,\n\n55:27.160 --> 55:32.080\n they are mold, they're designed to be sent off\n\n55:32.080 --> 55:34.040\n into a relatively static environment.\n\n55:34.040 --> 55:36.400\n And whatever dynamic things happen in the environment,\n\n55:36.400 --> 55:38.920\n they have a very limited capacity to respond to.\n\n55:38.920 --> 55:43.080\n A human baby, a human toddler of 18 months of age\n\n55:43.080 --> 55:45.840\n has more capacity to manage its own attention\n\n55:45.840 --> 55:49.200\n and its own capacity to make better sense of the world\n\n55:49.200 --> 55:51.720\n than the most advanced robots today.\n\n55:51.720 --> 55:55.160\n So again, my cat, I think can do a better job of my two\n\n55:55.160 --> 55:56.400\n and they're both pretty clever.\n\n55:56.400 --> 55:59.440\n So I do think though, back to my kind of original point,\n\n55:59.440 --> 56:02.720\n I think that it's not, for me, it's not question at all\n\n56:02.720 --> 56:05.960\n that we will be able to create synthetic systems\n\n56:05.960 --> 56:09.200\n that are able to do this better than the human,\n\n56:09.200 --> 56:11.720\n at an equal level or better than the human mind.\n\n56:11.720 --> 56:16.400\n It's also for me, not a question that we will be able\n\n56:16.400 --> 56:20.160\n to put them alongside humans\n\n56:20.160 --> 56:23.240\n so that they capture the full broad spectrum\n\n56:23.240 --> 56:25.400\n of what we are seeing as well.\n\n56:25.400 --> 56:28.040\n And also looking at our responses,\n\n56:28.040 --> 56:28.920\n listening to our responses,\n\n56:28.920 --> 56:32.040\n even maybe measuring certain vital signs about us.\n\n56:32.040 --> 56:34.440\n So in this kind of sidecar mode,\n\n56:34.440 --> 56:37.600\n a greater intelligence could use us\n\n56:37.600 --> 56:42.080\n and our whatever 80 years of life to train itself up\n\n56:42.080 --> 56:45.080\n and then be a very good simulacrum of us moving forward.\n\n56:45.080 --> 56:48.120\n So who is in the sidecar\n\n56:48.120 --> 56:50.440\n in that picture of the future exactly?\n\n56:50.440 --> 56:52.960\n The baby version of our immortal selves.\n\n56:52.960 --> 56:56.160\n Okay, so once the baby grows up,\n\n56:56.160 --> 56:58.440\n is there any use for humans?\n\n56:58.440 --> 56:59.960\n I think so.\n\n56:59.960 --> 57:03.240\n I think that out of epistemic humility,\n\n57:03.240 --> 57:05.600\n we need to keep humans around for a long time.\n\n57:05.600 --> 57:07.960\n And I would hope that anyone making those systems\n\n57:07.960 --> 57:10.040\n would believe that to be true.\n\n57:10.040 --> 57:11.640\n Out of epistemic humility,\n\n57:11.640 --> 57:13.480\n what's the nature of the humility that?\n\n57:13.480 --> 57:15.400\n That we don't know what we don't know.\n\n57:16.440 --> 57:17.280\n So we don't.\n\n57:18.960 --> 57:19.800\n Right?\n\n57:19.800 --> 57:20.640\n So we don't know.\n\n57:20.640 --> 57:21.680\n First we have to build systems\n\n57:21.680 --> 57:24.400\n that help us do the things that we do know about\n\n57:24.400 --> 57:26.760\n that can then probe the unknowns that we know about.\n\n57:26.760 --> 57:28.560\n But the unknown unknowns, we don't know.\n\n57:28.560 --> 57:30.040\n We could always know.\n\n57:30.040 --> 57:31.160\n Nature is the one thing\n\n57:31.160 --> 57:33.800\n that is infinitely able to surprise us.\n\n57:33.800 --> 57:35.880\n So we should keep biological humans around\n\n57:35.880 --> 57:37.600\n for a very, very, very long time.\n\n57:37.600 --> 57:40.440\n Even after our immortal selves have transcended\n\n57:40.440 --> 57:42.880\n and have gone off to explore other worlds,\n\n57:42.880 --> 57:45.200\n gone to go communicate with the lifeforms living in the sun\n\n57:45.200 --> 57:46.040\n or whatever else.\n\n57:46.040 --> 57:49.200\n So I think that's,\n\n57:49.200 --> 57:53.000\n for me, these seem like things that are going to happen.\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:54.480\n Like I don't really question that,\n\n57:54.480 --> 57:55.720\n that they're gonna happen.\n\n57:55.720 --> 57:58.240\n Assuming we don't completely destroy ourselves.\n\n57:58.240 --> 58:02.480\n Is it possible to create an AI system\n\n58:02.480 --> 58:06.160\n that you fall in love with and it falls in love with you\n\n58:06.160 --> 58:08.480\n and you have a romantic relationship with it?\n\n58:08.480 --> 58:10.760\n Or a deep friendship, let's say.\n\n58:10.760 --> 58:12.680\n I would hope that that is the design criteria\n\n58:12.680 --> 58:14.520\n for any of these systems.\n\n58:14.520 --> 58:18.480\n If we cannot have a meaningful relationship with it,\n\n58:18.480 --> 58:20.320\n then it's still just a chunk of silicon.\n\n58:20.320 --> 58:21.680\n So then what is meaningful?\n\n58:21.680 --> 58:23.800\n Because back to sugar.\n\n58:23.800 --> 58:25.400\n Well, sugar doesn't love you back, right?\n\n58:25.400 --> 58:26.840\n So the computer has to love you back.\n\n58:26.840 --> 58:28.200\n And what does love mean?\n\n58:28.200 --> 58:30.160\n Well, in this context, for me, love,\n\n58:30.160 --> 58:32.040\n I'm gonna take a page from Alain de Botton.\n\n58:32.040 --> 58:34.400\n Love means that it wants to help us\n\n58:34.400 --> 58:36.640\n become the best version of ourselves.\n\n58:36.640 --> 58:39.440\n Yes, that's beautiful.\n\n58:39.440 --> 58:40.760\n That's a beautiful definition of love.\n\n58:40.760 --> 58:45.360\n So what role does love play in the human condition\n\n58:45.360 --> 58:48.720\n at the individual level and at the group level?\n\n58:48.720 --> 58:51.120\n Because you were kind of saying that humans,\n\n58:51.120 --> 58:52.280\n we should really consider humans\n\n58:52.280 --> 58:55.320\n both at the individual and the group and the societal level.\n\n58:55.320 --> 58:56.960\n What's the role of love in this whole thing?\n\n58:56.960 --> 58:59.640\n We talked about sex, we talked about death,\n\n58:59.640 --> 59:02.320\n thanks to the bacteria that invented it.\n\n59:02.320 --> 59:04.320\n At which point did we invent love, by the way?\n\n59:04.320 --> 59:05.560\n I mean, is that also?\n\n59:05.560 --> 59:08.960\n No, I think love is the start of it all.\n\n59:08.960 --> 59:13.080\n And the feelings of, and this gets sort of beyond\n\n59:13.080 --> 59:16.760\n just romantic, sensual, whatever kind of things,\n\n59:16.760 --> 59:19.720\n but actually genuine love as we have for another person.\n\n59:19.720 --> 59:22.680\n Love as it would be used in a religious text, right?\n\n59:22.680 --> 59:25.480\n I think that capacity to feel love\n\n59:25.480 --> 59:28.440\n more than consciousness, that is the universal thing.\n\n59:28.440 --> 59:30.320\n Our feeling of love is actually a sense\n\n59:30.320 --> 59:31.320\n of that generativity.\n\n59:31.320 --> 59:33.120\n When we can look at another person\n\n59:33.120 --> 59:37.440\n and see that they can be something more than they are,\n\n59:37.440 --> 59:42.440\n and more than just a pigeonhole we might stick them in.\n\n59:42.480 --> 59:44.160\n I mean, I think there's, in any religious text,\n\n59:44.160 --> 59:47.640\n you'll find voiced some concept of this,\n\n59:47.640 --> 59:50.920\n that you should see the grace of God in the other person.\n\n59:50.920 --> 59:54.760\n They're made in the spirit of the love\n\n59:54.760 --> 59:57.120\n that God feels for his creation or her creation.\n\n59:57.120 --> 1:00:00.180\n And so I think this thing is actually the root of it.\n\n1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:04.800\n So I would say, I don't think molecules of water\n\n1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:06.280\n feel consciousness, have consciousness,\n\n1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:10.920\n but there is some proto micro quantum thing of love.\n\n1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:14.080\n That's the generativity when there's more energy\n\n1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:16.280\n than what they need to maintain equilibrium.\n\n1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:19.800\n And that when you sum it all up is something that leads to,\n\n1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:23.500\n I mean, I had my mind blown one day as an undergrad\n\n1:00:23.500 --> 1:00:24.560\n at the physics computer lab.\n\n1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:28.300\n I logged in and when you log into bash for a long time,\n\n1:00:28.300 --> 1:00:29.600\n there was a little fortune that would come out.\n\n1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:32.400\n And it said, man was created by water\n\n1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:33.940\n to carry itself uphill.\n\n1:00:33.940 --> 1:00:37.960\n And I was logging into work on some problem set\n\n1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:40.540\n and I logged in and I saw that and I just said,\n\n1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:43.120\n son of a bitch, I just, I logged out\n\n1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.080\n and I went to the coffee shop and I got a coffee\n\n1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:47.040\n and I sat there on the quad and I'm like,\n\n1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:52.040\n you know, it's not wrong and yet WTF, right?\n\n1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:55.320\n So when you look at it that way,\n\n1:00:55.320 --> 1:00:59.040\n it's like, yeah, okay, non equilibrium physics is a thing.\n\n1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:00.960\n And so when we think about love,\n\n1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:05.360\n when we think about these kinds of things, I would say\n\n1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:08.160\n that in the modern day human condition,\n\n1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:12.300\n there's a lot of talk about freedom and individual liberty\n\n1:01:12.300 --> 1:01:14.600\n and rights and all these things,\n\n1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:18.120\n but that's very Hegelian, it's very kind of following\n\n1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.760\n from the Western philosophy of the individual as sacrosanct,\n\n1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:26.360\n but it's not really couched I think the right way\n\n1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.460\n because it should be how do we maximize people's ability\n\n1:01:29.460 --> 1:01:32.100\n to love each other, to love themselves first,\n\n1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:34.560\n to love each other, their responsibilities\n\n1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:37.800\n to the previous generation, to the future generations.\n\n1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:39.280\n Those are the kinds of things\n\n1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:41.840\n that should be our design criteria, right?\n\n1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:45.720\n Those should be what we start with to then come up\n\n1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:48.280\n with the philosophies of self and of rights\n\n1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:52.080\n and responsibilities, but that love being at the center\n\n1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:55.720\n of it, I think when we design systems for cognition,\n\n1:01:56.680 --> 1:01:58.700\n it should absolutely be built that way.\n\n1:01:58.700 --> 1:02:02.240\n I think if we simply focus on efficiency and productivity,\n\n1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:04.900\n these kind of very industrial era,\n\n1:02:05.900 --> 1:02:08.200\n all the things that Marx had issues with, right?\n\n1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:11.880\n Those, that's a way to go and really I think go off\n\n1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:13.600\n the deep end in the wrong way.\n\n1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:18.600\n So one of the interesting consequences of thinking of life\n\n1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:22.440\n in this hierarchical way of an individual human\n\n1:02:22.440 --> 1:02:25.040\n and then there's groups and there's societies\n\n1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:30.040\n is I believe that you believe that corporations are people.\n\n1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:36.600\n So this is a kind of a politically dense idea,\n\n1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:37.440\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:39.100\n If we just throw politics aside,\n\n1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:41.300\n if we throw all of that aside,\n\n1:02:41.300 --> 1:02:44.640\n in which sense do you believe that corporations are people?\n\n1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:47.760\n And how does love connect to that?\n\n1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:52.040\n Right, so the belief is that groups of people\n\n1:02:52.040 --> 1:02:55.680\n have some kind of higher level, I would say mesoscopic\n\n1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:56.680\n claim to agency.\n\n1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:00.920\n So where do I, let's start with this.\n\n1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:03.720\n Most people would say, okay, individuals have claims\n\n1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:05.140\n to agency and sovereignty.\n\n1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:07.640\n Nations, we certainly act as if nations,\n\n1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:09.520\n so at a very large, large scale,\n\n1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:13.120\n nations have rights to sovereignty and agency.\n\n1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:15.000\n Like everyone plays the game of modernity\n\n1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.320\n as if that's true, right?\n\n1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:17.380\n We believe France is a thing,\n\n1:03:17.380 --> 1:03:18.800\n we believe the United States is a thing.\n\n1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:23.100\n But to say that groups of people at a smaller level\n\n1:03:23.100 --> 1:03:26.640\n than that, like a family unit is the thing.\n\n1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:30.440\n Well, in our laws, we actually do encode this concept.\n\n1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:33.800\n I believe that in a relationship and a marriage, right,\n\n1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:37.720\n one partner can sue for loss of consortium, right?\n\n1:03:37.720 --> 1:03:39.820\n If someone breaks up the marriage or whatever.\n\n1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:41.560\n So these are concepts that even in law,\n\n1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:44.720\n we do respect that there is something about the union\n\n1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:45.980\n and about the family.\n\n1:03:45.980 --> 1:03:48.640\n So for me, I don't think it's so weird to think\n\n1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:51.820\n that groups of people have a right to,\n\n1:03:51.820 --> 1:03:54.640\n a claim to rights and sovereignty of some degree.\n\n1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:59.040\n I mean, we look at our clubs, we look at churches.\n\n1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:02.000\n These are, we talk about these collectives of people\n\n1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.800\n as if they have a real agency to them, and they do.\n\n1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:08.720\n But I think if we take that one step further and say,\n\n1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:10.320\n okay, they can accrue resources.\n\n1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:12.720\n Well, yes, check, you know, and by law they can.\n\n1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:17.060\n They can own land, they can engage in contracts,\n\n1:04:17.060 --> 1:04:18.840\n they can do all these different kinds of things.\n\n1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:22.600\n So we in legal terms support this idea\n\n1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:24.680\n that groups of people have rights.\n\n1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:28.040\n Where we go wrong on this stuff\n\n1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:31.280\n is that the most popular version of this\n\n1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:35.360\n is the for profit absentee owner corporation\n\n1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:38.440\n that then is able to amass larger resources\n\n1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:40.840\n than anyone else in the landscape, anything else,\n\n1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:42.760\n any other entity of equivalent size.\n\n1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:45.480\n And they're able to essentially bully around individuals,\n\n1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:47.040\n whether it's laborers, whether it's people\n\n1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:48.960\n whose resources they want to capture.\n\n1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:50.480\n They're also able to bully around\n\n1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:52.160\n our system of representation,\n\n1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:55.540\n which is still tied to individuals, right?\n\n1:04:55.540 --> 1:04:58.520\n So I don't believe that's correct.\n\n1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.160\n I don't think it's good that they, you know,\n\n1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.320\n they're people, but they're assholes.\n\n1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:03.680\n I don't think that corporations as people\n\n1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:05.520\n acting like assholes is a good thing.\n\n1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:08.440\n But the idea that collectives and collections of people\n\n1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:10.120\n that we should treat them philosophically\n\n1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:15.120\n as having some agency and some mass,\n\n1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:18.000\n at a mesoscopic level, I think that's an important thing\n\n1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:22.400\n because one thing I do think we underappreciate sometimes\n\n1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:26.200\n is the fact that relationships have relationships.\n\n1:05:26.200 --> 1:05:27.240\n So it's not just individuals\n\n1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:29.120\n having relationships with each other.\n\n1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:32.080\n But if you have eight people seated around a table, right?\n\n1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:34.200\n Each person has a relationship with each of the others\n\n1:05:34.200 --> 1:05:35.640\n and that's obvious.\n\n1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:37.880\n But then if it's four couples,\n\n1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:39.720\n each couple also has a relationship\n\n1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:41.720\n with each of the other couples, right?\n\n1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:42.720\n The dyads do.\n\n1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:45.600\n And if it's couples, but one is the, you know,\n\n1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:48.200\n father and mother older, and then, you know,\n\n1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:50.960\n one of their children and their spouse,\n\n1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:53.980\n that family unit of four has a relationship\n\n1:05:53.980 --> 1:05:55.760\n with the other family unit of four.\n\n1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:57.640\n So the idea that relationships have relationships\n\n1:05:57.640 --> 1:05:59.920\n is something that we intuitively know\n\n1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:01.780\n in navigating the social landscape,\n\n1:06:01.780 --> 1:06:04.720\n but it's not something I hear expressed like that.\n\n1:06:04.720 --> 1:06:06.680\n It's certainly not something that is,\n\n1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:08.160\n I think, taken into account very well\n\n1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.480\n when we design these kinds of things.\n\n1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:14.080\n So I think the reason why I care a lot about this\n\n1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:16.520\n is because I think the future of humanity\n\n1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:19.660\n requires us to form better sense make,\n\n1:06:19.660 --> 1:06:23.680\n collective sense making units at something, you know,\n\n1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:28.160\n around Dunbar number, you know, half to five X Dunbar.\n\n1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:30.640\n And that's very different than right now\n\n1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:33.600\n where we defer sense making\n\n1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:37.040\n to massive aging zombie institutions.\n\n1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:38.520\n Or we just do it ourselves.\n\n1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:39.360\n Go it alone.\n\n1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:41.120\n Go to the dark force of the internet by ourselves.\n\n1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:42.360\n So that's really interesting.\n\n1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:45.340\n So you've talked about agency,\n\n1:06:45.340 --> 1:06:47.760\n I think maybe calling it a convenient fiction\n\n1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:49.620\n at all these different levels.\n\n1:06:49.620 --> 1:06:52.080\n So even at the human individual level,\n\n1:06:52.080 --> 1:06:53.160\n it's kind of a fiction.\n\n1:06:53.160 --> 1:06:55.080\n We all believe, because we are, like you said,\n\n1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:57.720\n made of cells and cells are made of atoms.\n\n1:06:57.720 --> 1:06:58.980\n So that's a useful fiction.\n\n1:06:58.980 --> 1:07:02.900\n And then there's nations that seems to be a useful fiction,\n\n1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:06.900\n but it seems like some fictions are better than others.\n\n1:07:06.900 --> 1:07:08.400\n You know, there's a lot of people that argue\n\n1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:11.000\n the fiction of nation is a bad idea.\n\n1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.880\n One of them lives two doors down from me,\n\n1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:16.160\n Michael Malice, he's an anarchist.\n\n1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:18.280\n You know, I'm sure there's a lot of people\n\n1:07:18.280 --> 1:07:21.860\n who are into meditation that believe the idea,\n\n1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:24.920\n this useful fiction of agency of an individual\n\n1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:26.680\n is a troublesome as well.\n\n1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:29.460\n We need to let go of that in order to truly,\n\n1:07:29.460 --> 1:07:32.320\n like to transcend, I don't know.\n\n1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:33.760\n I don't know what words you want to use,\n\n1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:38.440\n but suffering or to elevate the experience of life.\n\n1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:40.800\n So you're kind of arguing that,\n\n1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:44.680\n okay, so we have some of these useful fictions of agency.\n\n1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:49.000\n We should add a stronger fiction that we tell ourselves\n\n1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.700\n about the agency of groups in the hundreds\n\n1:07:52.700 --> 1:07:57.700\n of the half a Dunbar's number, 5X Dunbar's number.\n\n1:07:57.920 --> 1:07:58.760\n Yeah, something on that order.\n\n1:07:58.760 --> 1:07:59.800\n And we call them fictions,\n\n1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:01.580\n but really they're rules of the game, right?\n\n1:08:01.580 --> 1:08:05.720\n Rules that we feel are fair or rules that we consent to.\n\n1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:07.000\n Yeah, I always question the rules\n\n1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.600\n when I lose like a monopoly.\n\n1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:09.840\n That's when I usually question the rules.\n\n1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:11.600\n When I'm winning, I don't question the rules.\n\n1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:12.880\n We should play a game Monopoly someday.\n\n1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:15.240\n There's a trippy version of it that we could do.\n\n1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:16.320\n What kind?\n\n1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:19.200\n Contract Monopoly is introduced by a friend of mine to me\n\n1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:23.120\n where you can write contracts on future earnings\n\n1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:24.600\n or landing on various things.\n\n1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:26.720\n And you can hand out like, you know,\n\n1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:28.080\n you can land the first three times you land\n\n1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:30.160\n in a park place, it's free or whatever.\n\n1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:33.480\n And then you can start trading those contracts for money.\n\n1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:35.440\n And then you create a human civilization\n\n1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:38.280\n and somehow Bitcoin comes into it.\n\n1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.520\n Okay, but some of these.\n\n1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:43.040\n Actually, I bet if me and you and Eric sat down\n\n1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:45.320\n to play a game Monopoly and we were to make NFTs\n\n1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:48.000\n out of the contracts we wrote, we could make a lot of money.\n\n1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.320\n Now it's a terrible idea.\n\n1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:50.200\n I would never do it,\n\n1:08:50.200 --> 1:08:52.920\n but I bet we could actually sell the NFTs around.\n\n1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:56.800\n I have other ideas to make money that I could tell you\n\n1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.400\n and they're all terrible ideas.\n\n1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:02.280\n Yeah, including cat videos on the internet.\n\n1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:04.600\n Okay, but some of these rules of the game,\n\n1:09:04.600 --> 1:09:06.040\n some of these fictions are,\n\n1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:09.280\n it seems like they're better than others.\n\n1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:13.320\n They have worked this far to cohere human,\n\n1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:14.840\n to organize human collective action.\n\n1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:16.600\n But you're saying something about,\n\n1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:19.240\n especially this technological age\n\n1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:23.640\n requires modified fictions, stories of agency.\n\n1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:25.040\n Why the Dunbar number?\n\n1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:28.240\n And also, you know, how do you select the group of people?\n\n1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.760\n You know, Dunbar numbers, I think I have the sense\n\n1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:36.360\n that it's overused as a kind of law\n\n1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:41.280\n that somehow we can have deep human connection at this scale.\n\n1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:45.440\n Like some of it feels like an interface problem too.\n\n1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:48.080\n It feels like if I have the right tools,\n\n1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:51.840\n I can deeply connect with a larger number of people.\n\n1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:55.480\n It just feels like there's a huge value\n\n1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:59.400\n to interacting just in person, getting to share\n\n1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:00.960\n traumatic experiences together,\n\n1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:02.720\n beautiful experiences together.\n\n1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:06.920\n There's other experiences like that in the digital space\n\n1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:07.760\n that you can share.\n\n1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:09.360\n It just feels like Dunbar's number\n\n1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:10.800\n could be expanded significantly,\n\n1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:15.000\n perhaps not to the level of millions and billions,\n\n1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.280\n but it feels like it could be expanded.\n\n1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:20.280\n So how do we find the right interface, you think,\n\n1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:24.840\n for having a little bit of a collective here\n\n1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:26.080\n that has agency?\n\n1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:28.080\n You're right that there's many different ways\n\n1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:30.000\n that we can build trust with each other.\n\n1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:30.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:33.960\n My friend Joe Edelman talks about a few different ways\n\n1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:38.960\n that, you know, mutual appreciation, trustful conflict,\n\n1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:41.320\n just experiencing something like, you know,\n\n1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:43.640\n there's a variety of different things that we can do,\n\n1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:48.480\n but all those things take time and you have to be present.\n\n1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:50.320\n The less present you are, I mean, there's just, again,\n\n1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:51.560\n a no free lunch principle here.\n\n1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:54.200\n The less present you are, the more of them you can do,\n\n1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:56.800\n but then the less connection you build.\n\n1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:59.440\n So I think there is sort of a human capacity issue\n\n1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:00.280\n around some of these things.\n\n1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:04.800\n Now, that being said, if we can use certain technologies,\n\n1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:07.520\n so for instance, if I write a little monograph\n\n1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:08.720\n on my view of the world,\n\n1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:10.600\n you read it asynchronously at some point,\n\n1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:11.920\n and you're like, wow, Peter, this is great.\n\n1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:12.800\n Here's mine.\n\n1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:13.640\n I read it.\n\n1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:15.320\n I'm like, wow, Lex, this is awesome.\n\n1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:18.720\n We can be friends without having to spend 10 years,\n\n1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:20.560\n you know, figuring all this stuff out together.\n\n1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:22.200\n We just read each other's thing and be like,\n\n1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:24.800\n oh yeah, this guy's exactly in my wheelhouse\n\n1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:26.080\n and vice versa.\n\n1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:30.520\n And we can then, you know, connect just a few times a year\n\n1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:33.040\n and maintain a high trust relationship.\n\n1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:34.320\n It can be expanded a little bit,\n\n1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:35.840\n but it also requires,\n\n1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:37.320\n these things are not all technological in nature.\n\n1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:39.640\n It requires the individual themselves\n\n1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:41.680\n to have a certain level of capacity,\n\n1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:44.760\n to have a certain lack of neuroticism, right?\n\n1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:48.080\n If you want to use like the ocean big five sort of model,\n\n1:11:48.080 --> 1:11:49.680\n people have to be pretty centered.\n\n1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:50.640\n The less centered you are,\n\n1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:52.840\n the fewer authentic connections you can really build\n\n1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:54.800\n for a particular unit of time.\n\n1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:55.840\n It just takes more time.\n\n1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:57.160\n Other people have to put up with your crap.\n\n1:11:57.160 --> 1:11:58.120\n Like there's just a lot of the stuff\n\n1:11:58.120 --> 1:12:00.000\n that you have to deal with\n\n1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.240\n if you are not so well balanced, right?\n\n1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:04.760\n So yes, we can help people get better\n\n1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:06.760\n to where they can develop more relationships faster,\n\n1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:09.560\n and then you can maybe expand Dunbar number by quite a bit,\n\n1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:10.640\n but you're not going to do it.\n\n1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.880\n I think it's going to be hard to get it beyond 10X,\n\n1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:16.280\n kind of the rough swag of what it is, you know?\n\n1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:20.840\n Well, don't you think that AI systems could be an addition\n\n1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:22.640\n to the Dunbar's number?\n\n1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:23.480\n So like why?\n\n1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:25.600\n Do you count as one system or multiple AI systems?\n\n1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:26.560\n Multiple AI systems.\n\n1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:28.600\n So I do believe that AI systems,\n\n1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:31.360\n for them to integrate into human society as it is now,\n\n1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:32.600\n have to have a sense of agency.\n\n1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:35.280\n So there has to be a individual\n\n1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:37.600\n because otherwise we wouldn't relate to them.\n\n1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:40.240\n We could engage certain kinds of individuals\n\n1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:42.680\n to make sense of them for us and be almost like,\n\n1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:44.960\n did you ever watch Star Trek?\n\n1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:46.480\n Like Voyager, like there's the Volta,\n\n1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:47.640\n who are like the interfaces,\n\n1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:50.480\n the ambassadors for the Dominion.\n\n1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:53.120\n We may have ambassadors that speak\n\n1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:54.400\n on behalf of these systems.\n\n1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:56.160\n They're like the Mentats of Dune, maybe,\n\n1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:57.280\n or something like this.\n\n1:12:57.280 --> 1:12:59.320\n I mean, we already have this to some extent.\n\n1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:01.160\n If you look at the biggest sort of,\n\n1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:02.120\n I wouldn't say AI system,\n\n1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:04.080\n but the biggest cybernetic system in the world\n\n1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:05.160\n is the financial markets.\n\n1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:08.000\n It runs outside of any individual's control,\n\n1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:09.920\n and you have an entire stack of people on Wall Street,\n\n1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:13.240\n Wall Street analysts to CNBC reporters, whatever.\n\n1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:16.920\n They're all helping to communicate what does this mean?\n\n1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:18.120\n You know, like Jim Cramer,\n\n1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:19.560\n like coming around and yelling and stuff.\n\n1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:22.560\n Like all of these people are part of that lowering\n\n1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:26.320\n of the complexity there to meet sense,\n\n1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:28.440\n you know, to help do sense making for people\n\n1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:29.800\n at whatever capacity they're at.\n\n1:13:29.800 --> 1:13:31.560\n And I don't see this changing with AI systems.\n\n1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:33.400\n I think you would have ringside commentators\n\n1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:34.560\n talking about all this stuff\n\n1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.600\n that this AI system is trying to do over here, over here,\n\n1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.120\n because it's actually a super intelligence.\n\n1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:40.800\n So if you want to talk about humans interfacing,\n\n1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:42.480\n making first contact with the super intelligence,\n\n1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:43.600\n we're already there.\n\n1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:44.800\n We do it pretty poorly.\n\n1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:47.240\n And if you look at the gradient of power and money,\n\n1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:48.800\n what happens is the people closest to it\n\n1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:50.960\n will absolutely exploit their distance\n\n1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:54.360\n for personal financial gain.\n\n1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.080\n So we should look at that and be like,\n\n1:13:56.080 --> 1:13:57.320\n oh, well, that's probably what the future\n\n1:13:57.320 --> 1:13:58.880\n will look like as well.\n\n1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:00.240\n But nonetheless, I mean,\n\n1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:01.360\n we're already doing this kind of thing.\n\n1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:03.800\n So in the future, we can have AI systems,\n\n1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:05.720\n but you're still gonna have to trust people\n\n1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:08.400\n to bridge the sense making gap to them.\n\n1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:10.800\n See, I just feel like there could be\n\n1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:13.880\n like millions of AI systems that have,\n\n1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:17.080\n have agencies, you have,\n\n1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:19.480\n when you say one super intelligence,\n\n1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:22.280\n super intelligence in that context means\n\n1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:26.080\n it's able to solve particular problems extremely well.\n\n1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:29.240\n But there's some aspect of human like intelligence\n\n1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:32.320\n that's necessary to be integrated into human society.\n\n1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:33.720\n So not financial markets,\n\n1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:36.760\n not sort of weather prediction systems,\n\n1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:39.680\n or I don't know, logistics optimization.\n\n1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:43.240\n I'm more referring to things that you interact with\n\n1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:45.120\n on the intellectual level.\n\n1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.120\n And that I think requires,\n\n1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:48.920\n there has to be a backstory.\n\n1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:50.080\n There has to be a personality.\n\n1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:53.320\n I believe it has to fear its own mortality in a genuine way.\n\n1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:56.560\n Like there has to be all,\n\n1:14:56.560 --> 1:14:59.680\n many of the elements that we humans experience\n\n1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:01.920\n that are fundamental to the human condition,\n\n1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:03.840\n because otherwise we would not have\n\n1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:05.840\n a deep connection with it.\n\n1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:07.800\n But I don't think having a deep connection with it\n\n1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:10.600\n is necessarily going to stop us from building a thing\n\n1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:13.360\n that has quite an alien intelligence aspect here.\n\n1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:16.640\n So the other kind of alien intelligence on this planet\n\n1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:18.640\n is the octopuses or octopodes\n\n1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:19.720\n or whatever you wanna call them.\n\n1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:21.000\n Octopi. Octopi, yeah.\n\n1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:22.400\n There's a little controversy\n\n1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:23.720\n as to what the plural is, I guess.\n\n1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:26.560\n But an octopus. I look forward to your letters.\n\n1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:28.880\n Yeah, an octopus,\n\n1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:32.120\n it really acts as a collective intelligence\n\n1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:34.320\n of eight intelligent arms, right?\n\n1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:37.000\n Its arms have a tremendous amount of neural density to them.\n\n1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:40.360\n And I see if we can build,\n\n1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:42.000\n I mean, just let's go with what you're saying.\n\n1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.400\n If we build a singular intelligence\n\n1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:48.080\n that interfaces with humans that has a sense of agency\n\n1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:49.600\n so it can run the cybernetic loop\n\n1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:51.080\n and develop its own theory of mind\n\n1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:52.960\n as well as its theory of action,\n\n1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:54.040\n all these things, I agree with you\n\n1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:56.240\n that that's the necessary components\n\n1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:57.800\n to build a real intelligence, right?\n\n1:15:57.800 --> 1:15:58.720\n There's gotta be something at stake.\n\n1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:00.000\n It's gotta make a decision.\n\n1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:01.280\n It's gotta then run the OODA loop.\n\n1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:03.000\n Okay, so we build one of those.\n\n1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:03.880\n Well, if we can build one of those,\n\n1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:05.640\n we can probably build 5 million of them.\n\n1:16:05.640 --> 1:16:07.400\n So we build 5 million of them.\n\n1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:09.960\n And if their cognitive systems are already digitized\n\n1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:12.000\n and already kind of there,\n\n1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:13.720\n we stick an antenna on each of them,\n\n1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:15.440\n bring it all back to a hive mind\n\n1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:17.640\n that maybe doesn't make all the individual decisions\n\n1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:19.360\n for them, but treats each one\n\n1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:21.480\n as almost like a neuronal input\n\n1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:23.880\n of a much higher bandwidth and fidelity,\n\n1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:25.920\n going back to a central system\n\n1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:30.240\n that is then able to perceive much broader dynamics\n\n1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:31.120\n that we can't see.\n\n1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:32.600\n In the same way that a phased array radar, right?\n\n1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:34.440\n You think about how phased array radar works.\n\n1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:36.200\n It's just sensitivity.\n\n1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:39.120\n It's just radars, and then it's hypersensitivity\n\n1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:41.160\n and really great timing between all of them.\n\n1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:42.600\n And with a flat array,\n\n1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:44.740\n it's as good as a curved radar dish, right?\n\n1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:45.580\n So with these things,\n\n1:16:45.580 --> 1:16:47.800\n it's a phased array of cybernetic systems\n\n1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:50.160\n that'll give the centralized intelligence\n\n1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:55.040\n much, much better, a much higher fidelity understanding\n\n1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:56.600\n of what's actually happening in the environment.\n\n1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:57.720\n But the more power,\n\n1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:02.480\n the more understanding the central super intelligence has,\n\n1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:06.600\n the dumber the individual like fingers\n\n1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:08.080\n of this intelligence are, I think.\n\n1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:08.920\n I think you...\n\n1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:09.760\n Not necessarily.\n\n1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:10.580\n In my sense...\n\n1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:11.420\n I don't see what has to be.\n\n1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:13.560\n This argument, there has to be,\n\n1:17:13.560 --> 1:17:15.660\n the experience of the individual agent\n\n1:17:15.660 --> 1:17:20.660\n has to have the full richness of the human like experience.\n\n1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:23.800\n You have to be able to be driving the car in the rain,\n\n1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:25.240\n listening to Bruce Springsteen,\n\n1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.280\n and all of a sudden break out in tears\n\n1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:30.580\n because remembering something that happened to you\n\n1:17:30.580 --> 1:17:31.420\n in high school.\n\n1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:32.240\n We can implant those memories\n\n1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:33.080\n if that's really needed.\n\n1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:33.920\n But no, I'm...\n\n1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:34.960\n No, but the central agency,\n\n1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:37.720\n like I guess I'm saying for, in my view,\n\n1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:39.620\n for intelligence to be born,\n\n1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:43.860\n you have to have a decentralization.\n\n1:17:43.860 --> 1:17:47.280\n Like each one has to struggle and reach.\n\n1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:51.920\n So each one in excess of energy has to reach for order\n\n1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:54.420\n as opposed to a central place doing so.\n\n1:17:54.420 --> 1:17:55.640\n Have you ever read like some sci fi\n\n1:17:55.640 --> 1:17:58.820\n where there's like hive minds?\n\n1:17:58.820 --> 1:18:01.080\n Like the Wernher Vinge, I think has one of these.\n\n1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:05.160\n And then some of the stuff from the Commonwealth Saga,\n\n1:18:05.160 --> 1:18:06.960\n the idea that you're an individual,\n\n1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:09.240\n but you're connected with like a few other individuals\n\n1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:10.300\n telepathically as well.\n\n1:18:10.300 --> 1:18:12.560\n And together you form a swarm.\n\n1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:14.580\n So if you are, I ask you,\n\n1:18:14.580 --> 1:18:18.040\n what do you think is the experience of if you are like,\n\n1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:18.920\n well, a Borg, right?\n\n1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:22.600\n If you are one, if you're part of this hive mind,\n\n1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:25.360\n outside of all the aesthetics, forget the aesthetics,\n\n1:18:25.360 --> 1:18:28.360\n internally, what is your experience like?\n\n1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:30.600\n Because I have a theory as to what that looks like.\n\n1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:34.280\n The one question I have for you about that experience is\n\n1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:38.560\n how much is there a feeling of freedom, of free will?\n\n1:18:38.560 --> 1:18:43.280\n Because I obviously as a human, very unbiased,\n\n1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:46.120\n but also somebody who values freedom and biased,\n\n1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:50.200\n it feels like the experience of freedom is essential for\n\n1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:55.960\n trying stuff out, to being creative\n\n1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:59.080\n and doing something truly novel, which is at the core of.\n\n1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:00.920\n Yeah, well, I don't think you have to lose any freedom\n\n1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:02.040\n when you're in that mode.\n\n1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:04.560\n Because I think what happens is we think,\n\n1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:06.920\n we still think, I mean, you're still thinking about this\n\n1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:09.800\n in a sense of a top down command and control hierarchy,\n\n1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:12.280\n which is not what it has to be at all.\n\n1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:16.040\n I think the experience, so I'll just show by cards here.\n\n1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:19.720\n I think the experience of being a robot in that robot swarm,\n\n1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:22.840\n a robot who has agency over their own local environment\n\n1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:23.880\n that's doing sense making\n\n1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:25.880\n and reporting it back to the hive mind,\n\n1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:28.840\n I think that robot's experience would be one,\n\n1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:31.000\n when the hive mind is working well,\n\n1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:34.360\n it would be an experience of like talking to God, right?\n\n1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:37.480\n That you essentially are reporting to,\n\n1:19:37.480 --> 1:19:38.760\n you're sort of saying, here's what I see.\n\n1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:40.200\n I think this is what's gonna happen over here.\n\n1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:41.240\n I'm gonna go do this thing.\n\n1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:42.840\n Because I think if I'm gonna do this,\n\n1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:45.400\n this will make this change happen in the environment.\n\n1:19:45.400 --> 1:19:50.400\n And then God, she may tell you, that's great.\n\n1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:52.400\n And in fact, your brothers and sisters will join you\n\n1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:54.040\n to help make this go better, right?\n\n1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:56.440\n And then she can let your brothers and sisters know,\n\n1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:58.680\n hey, Peter's gonna go do this thing.\n\n1:19:58.680 --> 1:19:59.880\n Would you like to help him?\n\n1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:01.640\n Because we think that this will make this thing go better.\n\n1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:03.000\n And they'll say, yes, we'll help him.\n\n1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:05.560\n So the whole thing could be actually very emergent.\n\n1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:09.160\n The sense of, what does it feel like to be a cell\n\n1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:11.880\n and a network that is alive, that is generative.\n\n1:20:11.880 --> 1:20:14.760\n And I think actually the feeling is serendipity.\n\n1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:20.360\n That there's random order, not random disorder or chaos,\n\n1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:24.040\n but random order, just when you need it to hear Bruce Springsteen,\n\n1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:28.040\n you turn on the radio and bam, it's Bruce Springsteen, right?\n\n1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:30.600\n That feeling of serendipity, I feel like,\n\n1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:31.880\n this is a bit of a flight of fancy,\n\n1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:35.240\n but every cell in your body must have,\n\n1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:37.320\n what does it feel like to be a cell in your body?\n\n1:20:37.320 --> 1:20:39.320\n When it needs sugar, there's sugar.\n\n1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:41.640\n When it needs oxygen, there's just oxygen.\n\n1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:43.080\n Now, when it needs to go and do its work\n\n1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:46.120\n and pull like as one of your muscle fibers, right?\n\n1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:48.120\n It does its work and it's great.\n\n1:20:48.120 --> 1:20:49.560\n It contributes to the cause, right?\n\n1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:51.960\n So this is all, again, a flight of fancy,\n\n1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:53.880\n but I think as we extrapolate up,\n\n1:20:53.880 --> 1:20:56.520\n what does it feel like to be an independent individual\n\n1:20:56.520 --> 1:20:58.200\n with some bounded sense of freedom?\n\n1:20:58.200 --> 1:20:59.640\n All sense of freedom is actually bounded,\n\n1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:01.240\n but it was a bounded sense of freedom\n\n1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:04.360\n that still lives within a network that has order to it.\n\n1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:06.600\n And I feel like it has to be a feeling of serendipity.\n\n1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:10.680\n So the cell, there's a feeling of serendipity, even though.\n\n1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:12.680\n It has no way of explaining why it's getting oxygen\n\n1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:13.480\n and sugar when it gets it.\n\n1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:17.400\n So you have to, each individual component has to be too dumb\n\n1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:19.240\n to understand the big picture.\n\n1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:22.840\n No, the big picture is bigger than what it can understand.\n\n1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:24.680\n But isn't that an essential characteristic\n\n1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:27.160\n of the individual is to be too dumb\n\n1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:29.480\n to understand the bigger picture.\n\n1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:31.160\n Like not dumb necessarily,\n\n1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:33.960\n but limited in its capacity to understand.\n\n1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:36.680\n Because the moment you understand,\n\n1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:39.960\n I feel like that leads to, if you tell me now\n\n1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.480\n that there are some bigger intelligence\n\n1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:44.840\n controlling everything I do,\n\n1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:47.960\n intelligence broadly defined, meaning like,\n\n1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:50.840\n you know, even the Sam Harris thing, there's no free will.\n\n1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:55.160\n If I'm smart enough to truly understand that that's the case,\n\n1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:58.840\n that's gonna, I don't know if I.\n\n1:21:58.840 --> 1:22:00.920\n We have philosophical breakdown, right?\n\n1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:03.560\n Because we're in the West and we're pumped full of this stuff\n\n1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:06.760\n of like, you are a golden, fully free individual\n\n1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:08.360\n with all your freedoms and all your liberties\n\n1:22:08.360 --> 1:22:10.520\n and go grab a gun and shoot whatever you want to.\n\n1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:14.360\n No, it's actually, you don't actually have a lot of these,\n\n1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:15.800\n you're not unconstrained,\n\n1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:19.080\n but the areas where you can manifest agency,\n\n1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:21.720\n you're free to do those things.\n\n1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:23.160\n You can say whatever you want on this podcast.\n\n1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:24.280\n You can create a podcast, right?\n\n1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:24.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:27.720\n You're not, I mean, you have a lot of this kind of freedom,\n\n1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:30.040\n but even as you're doing this, you are actually,\n\n1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:32.840\n I guess where the denouement of this is that\n\n1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:37.720\n we are already intelligent agents in such a system, right?\n\n1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:39.960\n In that one of these like robots\n\n1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:42.280\n of one of 5 million little swarm robots\n\n1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:43.480\n or one of the Borg,\n\n1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:45.320\n they're just posting on internal bulletin board.\n\n1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:46.200\n I mean, maybe the Borg cube\n\n1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:48.440\n is just a giant Facebook machine floating in space\n\n1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:50.360\n and everyone's just posting on there.\n\n1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:52.680\n They're just posting really fast and like, oh yeah.\n\n1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:53.720\n It's called the metaverse now.\n\n1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:54.840\n That's called the metaverse, that's right.\n\n1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:55.480\n Here's the enterprise.\n\n1:22:55.480 --> 1:22:56.440\n Maybe we should all go shoot it.\n\n1:22:56.440 --> 1:22:58.840\n Yeah, everyone upvotes and they're gonna go shoot it, right?\n\n1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:02.120\n But we already are part of a human online\n\n1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:03.640\n collaborative environment\n\n1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:05.640\n and collaborative sensemaking system.\n\n1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:07.240\n It's not very good yet.\n\n1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:10.760\n It's got the overhangs of zombie sensemaking institutions\n\n1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:13.240\n all over it, but as that washes away\n\n1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:15.400\n and as we get better at this,\n\n1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:17.880\n we are going to see humanity improving\n\n1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:21.800\n at speeds that are unthinkable in the past.\n\n1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:23.640\n And it's not because anyone's freedoms were limited.\n\n1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:24.520\n In fact, the open source,\n\n1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:26.680\n and we started this with open source software, right?\n\n1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:29.240\n The collaboration, what the internet surfaced\n\n1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:31.160\n was the ability for people all over the world\n\n1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:32.920\n to collaborate and produce some of the most\n\n1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:35.800\n foundational software that's in use today, right?\n\n1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:36.920\n That entire ecosystem was created\n\n1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:38.120\n by collaborators all over the place.\n\n1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:42.760\n So these online kind of swarm kind of things\n\n1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:44.280\n are not novel.\n\n1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:47.320\n It's just, I'm just suggesting that future AI systems,\n\n1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:48.840\n if you can build one smart system,\n\n1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:51.400\n you have no reason not to build multiple.\n\n1:23:51.400 --> 1:23:52.120\n If you build multiple,\n\n1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:53.800\n there's no reason not to integrate them all\n\n1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:57.720\n into a collective sensemaking substrate.\n\n1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:00.360\n And that thing will certainly have immersion intelligence\n\n1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:01.720\n that none of the individuals\n\n1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:03.400\n and probably not any of the human designers\n\n1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:06.680\n will be able to really put a bow around and explain.\n\n1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:09.160\n But in some sense, would that AI system\n\n1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:13.160\n still be able to go like rural Texas,\n\n1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:16.840\n buy a ranch, go off the grid, go full survivalist?\n\n1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:20.200\n Like, can you disconnect from the hive mind?\n\n1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:23.240\n You may not want to.\n\n1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:27.960\n So to be ineffective, to be intelligent.\n\n1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:30.200\n You have access to way more intelligence capability\n\n1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:31.560\n if you're plugged into five million other\n\n1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:32.760\n really, really smart cyborgs.\n\n1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:34.040\n Why would you leave?\n\n1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:37.400\n So like there's a word control that comes to mind.\n\n1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:39.800\n So it doesn't feel like control,\n\n1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:43.080\n like overbearing control.\n\n1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:44.600\n It's just knowledge.\n\n1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:46.360\n I think systems, well, this is to your point.\n\n1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:47.640\n I mean, look at how much,\n\n1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:49.800\n how uncomfortable you are with this concept, right?\n\n1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:52.280\n I think systems that feel like overbearing control\n\n1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:54.760\n will not evolutionarily win out.\n\n1:24:54.760 --> 1:24:57.480\n I think systems that give their individual elements\n\n1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:00.280\n the feeling of serendipity and the feeling of agency\n\n1:25:00.280 --> 1:25:04.280\n that that will, those systems will win.\n\n1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:05.720\n But that's not to say that there will not be\n\n1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:08.040\n emergent higher level order on top of it.\n\n1:25:09.560 --> 1:25:11.320\n And that's the thing, that's the philosophical breakdown\n\n1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:13.480\n that we're staring right at,\n\n1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:14.840\n which is in the Western mind,\n\n1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:17.560\n I think there's a very sharp delineation\n\n1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:19.480\n between explicit control,\n\n1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:23.320\n Cartesian, like what is the vector?\n\n1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:24.280\n Where is the position?\n\n1:25:24.280 --> 1:25:25.560\n Where is it going?\n\n1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:26.680\n It's completely deterministic.\n\n1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:30.840\n And kind of this idea that things emerge.\n\n1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:32.840\n Everything we see is the emergent patterns\n\n1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:33.960\n of other things.\n\n1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:36.600\n And there is agency when there's extra energy.\n\n1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:42.200\n So you have spoken about a kind of meaning crisis\n\n1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:43.320\n that we're going through.\n\n1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:50.520\n But it feels like since we invented sex and death,\n\n1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:52.520\n we broadly speaking,\n\n1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:54.760\n we've been searching for a kind of meaning.\n\n1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:56.840\n So it feels like a human civilization\n\n1:25:56.840 --> 1:25:58.200\n has been going through a meaning crisis\n\n1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.840\n of different flavors throughout its history.\n\n1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:05.800\n Why is, how is this particular meaning crisis different?\n\n1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:09.000\n Or is it really a crisis and it wasn't previously?\n\n1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:09.960\n What's your sense?\n\n1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:11.400\n A lot of human history,\n\n1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:13.080\n there wasn't so much a meaning crisis.\n\n1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:14.280\n There was just a like food\n\n1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:16.920\n and not getting eaten by bears crisis, right?\n\n1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:18.840\n Once you get to a point where you can make food,\n\n1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:20.200\n there was the like not getting killed\n\n1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:21.960\n by other humans crisis.\n\n1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:24.760\n So sitting around wondering what is it all about,\n\n1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:26.600\n it's actually a relatively recent luxury.\n\n1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:29.640\n And to some extent, the meaning crisis coming out of that\n\n1:26:29.640 --> 1:26:33.000\n is precisely because, well, it's not precisely because,\n\n1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:36.200\n I believe that meaning is the consequence of\n\n1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:40.200\n when we make consequential decisions,\n\n1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:42.440\n it's tied to agency, right?\n\n1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:44.760\n When we make consequential decisions,\n\n1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:46.120\n that generates meaning.\n\n1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:47.960\n So if we make a lot of decisions,\n\n1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:50.040\n but we don't see the consequences of them,\n\n1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:52.200\n then it feels like what was the point, right?\n\n1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:53.640\n But if there's all these big things\n\n1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:55.160\n that we don't see the consequences of,\n\n1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:57.000\n right, but if there's all these big things happening,\n\n1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:58.280\n but we're just along for the ride,\n\n1:26:58.280 --> 1:26:59.880\n then it also does not feel very meaningful.\n\n1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:01.880\n Meaning, as far as I can tell,\n\n1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:03.960\n this is my working definition of CERCA 2021,\n\n1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:08.280\n is generally the result of a person\n\n1:27:08.280 --> 1:27:09.720\n making a consequential decision,\n\n1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:12.120\n acting on it and then seeing the consequences of it.\n\n1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:16.520\n So historically, just when humans are in survival mode,\n\n1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:18.440\n you're making consequential decisions all the time.\n\n1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:20.760\n So there's not a lack of meaning\n\n1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:23.320\n because like you either got eaten or you didn't, right?\n\n1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:25.480\n You got some food and that's great, you feel good.\n\n1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:27.400\n Like these are all consequential decisions.\n\n1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:32.840\n Only in the post fossil fuel and industrial revolution\n\n1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:35.960\n could we create a massive leisure class.\n\n1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:38.600\n I could sit around not being threatened by bears,\n\n1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:40.120\n not starving to death,\n\n1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:44.680\n making decisions somewhat,\n\n1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:47.320\n but a lot of times not seeing the consequences\n\n1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:48.440\n of any decisions they make.\n\n1:27:49.080 --> 1:27:51.400\n The general sort of sense of anomie,\n\n1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:53.240\n I think that is the French term for it,\n\n1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:55.400\n in the wake of the consumer society,\n\n1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:58.520\n in the wake of mass media telling everyone,\n\n1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:01.960\n hey, choosing between Hermes and Chanel\n\n1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:03.080\n is a meaningful decision.\n\n1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:04.120\n No, it's not.\n\n1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:05.560\n I don't know what either of those mean.\n\n1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:10.840\n Oh, they're high end luxury purses and crap like that.\n\n1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:13.480\n But the point is that we give people the idea\n\n1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:15.000\n that consumption is meaning,\n\n1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.480\n that making a choice of this team versus that team,\n\n1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:20.040\n spectating has meaning.\n\n1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:22.440\n So we produce all of these different things\n\n1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:25.240\n that are as if meaning, right?\n\n1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:28.200\n But really making a decision that has no consequences for us.\n\n1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:30.920\n And so that creates the meaning crisis.\n\n1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:33.240\n Well, you're saying choosing between Chanel\n\n1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:35.240\n and the other one has no consequence.\n\n1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:38.120\n I mean, why is one more meaningful than the other?\n\n1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:39.480\n It's not that it's more meaningful than the other.\n\n1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:42.440\n It's that you make a decision between these two brands\n\n1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:45.080\n and you're told this brand will make me look better\n\n1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:45.800\n in front of other people.\n\n1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:47.000\n If I buy this brand of car,\n\n1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:50.040\n if I wear that brand of apparel, right?\n\n1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:54.120\n Like a lot of decisions we make are around consumption,\n\n1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:56.520\n but consumption by itself doesn't actually yield meaning.\n\n1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:59.960\n Gaining social status does provide meaning.\n\n1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:03.560\n So that's why in this era of abundant production,\n\n1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:07.320\n so many things turn into status games.\n\n1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:09.320\n The NFT kind of explosion is a similar kind of thing.\n\n1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:11.880\n Everywhere there are status games\n\n1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:15.160\n because we just have so much excess production.\n\n1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:18.360\n But aren't those status games a source of meaning?\n\n1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:22.360\n Like why do the games we play have to be grounded\n\n1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:24.120\n in physical reality like they are\n\n1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:26.040\n when you're trying to run away from lions?\n\n1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:30.280\n Why can't we, in this virtuality world, on social media,\n\n1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.200\n why can't we play the games on social media,\n\n1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:33.320\n even the dark ones?\n\n1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:35.160\n Right, we can, we can.\n\n1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:37.640\n But you're saying that's creating a meaning crisis.\n\n1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:39.080\n Well, there's a meaning crisis\n\n1:29:39.080 --> 1:29:41.000\n in that there's two aspects of it.\n\n1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.720\n Number one, playing those kinds of status games\n\n1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:46.600\n oftentimes requires destroying the planet\n\n1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:51.800\n because it ties to consumption,\n\n1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:54.280\n consuming the latest and greatest version of a thing,\n\n1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:56.840\n buying the latest limited edition sneaker\n\n1:29:56.840 --> 1:29:58.120\n and throwing out all the old ones.\n\n1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.000\n Maybe it keeps in the old ones,\n\n1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:01.000\n but the amount of sneakers we have to cut up\n\n1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.200\n and destroy every year\n\n1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:05.640\n to create artificial scarcity for the next generation, right?\n\n1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:07.720\n This is kind of stuff that's not great.\n\n1:30:07.720 --> 1:30:08.600\n It's not great at all.\n\n1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:13.400\n So conspicuous consumption fueling status games\n\n1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:16.040\n is really bad for the planet, not sustainable.\n\n1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:19.640\n The second thing is you can play these kinds of status games,\n\n1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:22.520\n but then what it does is it renders you captured\n\n1:30:22.520 --> 1:30:23.640\n to the virtual environment.\n\n1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:26.760\n The status games that really wealthy people are playing\n\n1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:28.440\n are all around the hard resources\n\n1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:30.440\n where they're gonna build the factories,\n\n1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:31.800\n they're gonna have the fuel in the rare earths\n\n1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:33.160\n to make the next generation of robots.\n\n1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:34.760\n They're then going to run game,\n\n1:30:34.760 --> 1:30:36.680\n run circles around you and your children.\n\n1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:38.760\n So that's another reason not to play\n\n1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:40.040\n those virtual status games.\n\n1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:44.040\n So you're saying ultimately the big picture game is won\n\n1:30:44.040 --> 1:30:46.840\n by people who have access or control\n\n1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:48.360\n over actual hard resources.\n\n1:30:48.360 --> 1:30:51.080\n So you can't, you don't see a society\n\n1:30:51.080 --> 1:30:55.400\n where most of the games are played in the virtual space.\n\n1:30:55.400 --> 1:30:57.160\n They'll be captured in the physical space.\n\n1:30:57.160 --> 1:30:57.960\n It all builds.\n\n1:30:57.960 --> 1:31:00.840\n It's just like the stack of human being, right?\n\n1:31:00.840 --> 1:31:04.360\n If you only play the game at the cultural\n\n1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:05.960\n and then intellectual level,\n\n1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:07.320\n then the people with the hard resources\n\n1:31:07.320 --> 1:31:10.920\n and access to layer zero physical are going to own you.\n\n1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:13.480\n But isn't money not connected to,\n\n1:31:13.480 --> 1:31:15.560\n or less and less connected to hard resources\n\n1:31:15.560 --> 1:31:17.080\n and money still seems to work?\n\n1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:18.520\n It's a virtual technology.\n\n1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:19.720\n There's different kinds of money.\n\n1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:22.280\n Part of the reason that some of the stuff is able\n\n1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:29.280\n to go a little unhinged is because the big sovereignties\n\n1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:32.040\n where one spends money and uses money\n\n1:31:32.040 --> 1:31:33.640\n and plays money games and inflates money,\n\n1:31:34.600 --> 1:31:38.440\n their ability to adjudicate the physical resources\n\n1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:40.120\n and hard resources and the resources\n\n1:31:40.120 --> 1:31:42.200\n and hard resources on land and things like that,\n\n1:31:42.200 --> 1:31:44.040\n those have not been challenged in a very long time.\n\n1:31:45.480 --> 1:31:47.640\n So, you know, we went off the gold standard.\n\n1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:50.360\n Most money is not connected to physical resources.\n\n1:31:51.640 --> 1:31:52.520\n It's an idea.\n\n1:31:53.640 --> 1:31:57.480\n And that idea is very closely connected to status.\n\n1:31:59.880 --> 1:32:03.000\n But it's also tied to like, it's actually tied to law.\n\n1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.680\n It is tied to some physical hard things\n\n1:32:04.680 --> 1:32:06.120\n so you have to pay your taxes.\n\n1:32:06.120 --> 1:32:09.880\n Yes, so it's always at the end going to be connected\n\n1:32:09.880 --> 1:32:12.600\n to the blockchain of physical reality.\n\n1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:16.680\n So in the case of law and taxes, it's connected to government\n\n1:32:17.240 --> 1:32:20.680\n and government is what violence is the,\n\n1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:25.000\n I'm playing with stacks of devil's advocates here\n\n1:32:27.720 --> 1:32:30.520\n and popping one devil off the stack at a time.\n\n1:32:30.520 --> 1:32:31.560\n Isn't ultimately, of course,\n\n1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:33.080\n it'll be connected to physical reality,\n\n1:32:33.080 --> 1:32:35.560\n but just because people control the physical reality,\n\n1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:36.600\n it doesn't mean the status.\n\n1:32:36.600 --> 1:32:39.720\n I guess LeBron James in theory could make more money\n\n1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:43.320\n than the owners of the teams in theory.\n\n1:32:43.320 --> 1:32:44.920\n And to me, that's a virtual idea.\n\n1:32:44.920 --> 1:32:47.320\n So somebody else constructed a game\n\n1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:51.880\n and now you're playing in the virtual space of the game.\n\n1:32:51.880 --> 1:32:55.480\n So it just feels like there could be games where status,\n\n1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:59.640\n we build realities that give us meaning in the virtual space.\n\n1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:02.840\n I can imagine such things being possible.\n\n1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:04.440\n Oh yeah, okay, so I see what you're saying.\n\n1:33:04.440 --> 1:33:05.560\n I think I see what you're saying there\n\n1:33:05.560 --> 1:33:08.840\n with the idea there, I mean, we'll take the LeBron James side\n\n1:33:08.840 --> 1:33:10.760\n and put in like some YouTube influencer.\n\n1:33:10.760 --> 1:33:11.480\n Yes, sure.\n\n1:33:11.480 --> 1:33:15.000\n So the YouTube influencer, it is status games,\n\n1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:18.920\n but at a certain level, it precipitates into real dollars\n\n1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:21.160\n and into like, well, you look at Mr. Beast, right?\n\n1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:23.160\n He's like sending off half a million dollars\n\n1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:24.440\n worth of fireworks or something, right?\n\n1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:25.640\n Not a YouTube video.\n\n1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:28.520\n And also like saving, like saving trees and so on.\n\n1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:29.880\n Sure, right, trying to find a million trees\n\n1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:30.920\n with Mark Rober or whatever it was.\n\n1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:33.000\n Yeah, like it's not that those kinds of games\n\n1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:34.520\n can't lead to real consequences.\n\n1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:39.320\n It's that for the vast majority of people in consumer culture,\n\n1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:44.360\n they are incented by the, I would say mostly,\n\n1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:46.440\n I'm thinking about middle class consumers.\n\n1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:48.760\n They're incented by advertisements,\n\n1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:50.840\n they're scented by their memetic environment\n\n1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:54.760\n to treat the purchasing of certain things,\n\n1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:56.440\n the need to buy the latest model, whatever,\n\n1:33:56.440 --> 1:33:58.280\n the need to appear, however,\n\n1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:02.360\n the need to pursue status games as a driver of meaning.\n\n1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:04.440\n And my point would be that it's a very hollow\n\n1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:05.480\n driver of meaning.\n\n1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:08.280\n And that is what creates a meaning crisis.\n\n1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:10.040\n Because at the end of the day,\n\n1:34:10.040 --> 1:34:12.120\n it's like eating a lot of empty calories, right?\n\n1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:13.960\n Yeah, it tasted good going down, a lot of sugar,\n\n1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:15.800\n but man, it did not, it was not enough protein\n\n1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.080\n to help build your muscles.\n\n1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:18.920\n And you kind of feel that in your gut.\n\n1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:21.240\n And I think that's, I mean, so all this stuff aside\n\n1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:22.840\n and setting aside our discussion on currency,\n\n1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:24.360\n which I hope we get back to,\n\n1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:27.480\n that's what I mean about the meaning crisis,\n\n1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:30.120\n part of it being created by the fact that we don't,\n\n1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:32.520\n we're not encouraged to have more and more\n\n1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:34.200\n direct relationships.\n\n1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:37.880\n We're actually alienated from relating to,\n\n1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:40.360\n even our family members sometimes, right?\n\n1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:43.880\n We're encouraged to relate to brands.\n\n1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:46.280\n We're encouraged to relate to these kinds of things\n\n1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:49.240\n that then tell us to do things\n\n1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:51.240\n that are really of low consequence.\n\n1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:52.920\n And that's where the meaning crisis comes from.\n\n1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:54.760\n So the role of technology in this,\n\n1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:57.240\n so there's somebody you mentioned who's Jacques,\n\n1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:01.400\n his view of technology, he warns about the towering piles\n\n1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:05.400\n of technique, which I guess is a broad idea of technology.\n\n1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:08.120\n So I think, correct me if I'm wrong for him,\n\n1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:12.440\n technology is bad at moving away from human nature\n\n1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:14.680\n and it's ultimately is destructive.\n\n1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:16.920\n My question, broadly speaking, this meaning crisis,\n\n1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:19.640\n can technology, what are the pros and cons of technology?\n\n1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:21.000\n Can it be a good?\n\n1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:22.280\n Yeah, I think it can be.\n\n1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:24.600\n I certainly think it can be a good thing.\n\n1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:27.240\n Can it be a good? Yeah, I think it can be.\n\n1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:29.720\n I certainly draw on some of Alol's ideas\n\n1:35:29.720 --> 1:35:32.920\n and I think some of them are pretty good.\n\n1:35:32.920 --> 1:35:36.200\n But the way he defines technique is,\n\n1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:37.720\n well, also Simondon as well.\n\n1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:41.240\n I mean, he speaks to the general mentality of efficiency,\n\n1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:43.640\n homogenized processes, homogenized production,\n\n1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:47.160\n homogenized labor to produce homogenized artifacts\n\n1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:49.400\n that then are not actually,\n\n1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:53.080\n they don't sit well in the environment.\n\n1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:57.880\n Essentially, you can think of it as the antonym of craft.\n\n1:35:57.880 --> 1:36:02.040\n Whereas a craftsman will come to a problem,\n\n1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:04.280\n maybe a piece of wood and they make into a chair.\n\n1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:06.600\n It may be a site to build a house or build a stable\n\n1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:08.520\n or build whatever.\n\n1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:12.280\n And they will consider how to bring various things in\n\n1:36:12.280 --> 1:36:15.080\n to build something well contextualized\n\n1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:20.080\n that's in right relationship with that environment.\n\n1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:22.360\n But the way we have driven technology\n\n1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:25.720\n over the last 100 and 150 years is not that at all.\n\n1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:30.480\n It is how can we make sure the input materials\n\n1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:33.400\n are homogenized, cut to the same size,\n\n1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:36.840\n diluted and doped to exactly the right alloy concentrations.\n\n1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.680\n How do we create machines that then consume exactly\n\n1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:39.960\n the right kind of energy to be able to run\n\n1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:42.600\n at this high speed to stamp out the same parts,\n\n1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:44.080\n which then go out the door,\n\n1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:45.760\n everyone gets the same tickle of Mielmo.\n\n1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:46.800\n And the reason why everyone wants it\n\n1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:49.280\n is because we have broadcasts that tells everyone\n\n1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:50.520\n this is the cool thing.\n\n1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:52.560\n So we homogenize demand, right?\n\n1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:55.440\n And we're like Baudrillard and other critiques\n\n1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:57.520\n of modernity coming from that direction,\n\n1:36:57.520 --> 1:36:59.240\n the situation lists as well.\n\n1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:02.080\n It's that their point is that at this point in time,\n\n1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:04.560\n consumption is the thing that drives\n\n1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:06.680\n a lot of the economic stuff, not the need,\n\n1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:09.400\n but the need to consume and build status games on top.\n\n1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:12.120\n So we have homogenized, when we discovered,\n\n1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:14.800\n I think this is really like Bernays and stuff, right?\n\n1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:17.920\n In the early 20th century, we discovered we can create,\n\n1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:20.880\n we can create demand, we can create desire\n\n1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:23.560\n in a way that was not possible before\n\n1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:25.560\n because of broadcast media.\n\n1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:27.680\n And not only do we create desire,\n\n1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:29.360\n we don't create a desire for each person\n\n1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:31.080\n to connect to some bespoke thing,\n\n1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:33.640\n to build a relationship with their neighbor or their spouse.\n\n1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:36.080\n We are telling them, you need to consume this brand,\n\n1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:37.200\n you need to drive this vehicle,\n\n1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:38.320\n you gotta listen to this music,\n\n1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:40.920\n have you heard this, have you seen this movie, right?\n\n1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:44.800\n So creating homogenized demand makes it really cheap\n\n1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:46.520\n to create homogenized product.\n\n1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:48.520\n And now you have economics of scale.\n\n1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:50.000\n So we make the same tickle me Elmo,\n\n1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.800\n give it to all the kids and all the kids are like,\n\n1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:54.400\n hey, I got a tickle me Elmo, right?\n\n1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:58.640\n So this is ultimately where this ties in then\n\n1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:03.040\n to runaway hypercapitalism is that we then,\n\n1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:04.800\n capitalism is always looking for growth.\n\n1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:05.960\n It's always looking for growth\n\n1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:07.960\n and growth only happens at the margins.\n\n1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:09.960\n So you have to squeeze more and more demand out.\n\n1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:11.040\n You gotta make it cheaper and cheaper\n\n1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:12.280\n to make the same thing,\n\n1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:15.080\n but tell everyone they're still getting meaning from it.\n\n1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:18.040\n You're still like, this is still your tickle me Elmo, right?\n\n1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:21.400\n And we see little bits of this dripping critiques\n\n1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:22.800\n of this dripping in popular culture.\n\n1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:25.920\n You see it sometimes it's when Buzz Lightyear\n\n1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:27.760\n walks into the thing, he's like,\n\n1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:30.640\n oh my God, at the toy store, I'm just a toy.\n\n1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:31.760\n Like there's millions of other,\n\n1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:33.400\n or there's hundreds of other Buzz Lightyear's\n\n1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:34.720\n just like me, right?\n\n1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:38.080\n That is, I think, a fun Pixar critique\n\n1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:40.080\n on this homogenization dynamic.\n\n1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:42.880\n I agree with you on most of the things you're saying.\n\n1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:44.560\n So I'm playing devil's advocate here,\n\n1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:49.560\n but this homogenized machine of capitalism\n\n1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:54.240\n is also the thing that is able to fund,\n\n1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.120\n if channeled correctly, innovation, invention,\n\n1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:00.760\n and development of totally new things\n\n1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:02.280\n that in the best possible world,\n\n1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:05.600\n create all kinds of new experiences that can enrich lives,\n\n1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:09.840\n the quality of lives for all kinds of people.\n\n1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:12.360\n So isn't this the machine\n\n1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:15.120\n that actually enables the experiences\n\n1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:18.640\n and more and more experiences that will then give meaning?\n\n1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:21.040\n It has done that to some extent.\n\n1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.680\n I mean, it's not all good or bad in my perspective.\n\n1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.760\n We can always look backwards\n\n1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:29.120\n and offer a critique of the path we've taken\n\n1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:30.640\n to get to this point in time.\n\n1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:33.760\n But that's a different, that's somewhat different\n\n1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:35.880\n and informs the discussion,\n\n1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:37.680\n but it's somewhat different than the question\n\n1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:40.600\n of where do we go in the future, right?\n\n1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:42.720\n Is this still the same rocket we need to ride\n\n1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:43.560\n to get to the next point?\n\n1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:44.560\n Will it even get us to the next point?\n\n1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:46.240\n Well, how does this, so you're predicting the future,\n\n1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:48.760\n how does it go wrong in your view?\n\n1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:51.040\n We have the mechanisms,\n\n1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:53.920\n we have now explored enough technologies\n\n1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:57.760\n to where we can actually, I think, sustainably produce\n\n1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:02.360\n what most people in the world need to live.\n\n1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:07.640\n We have also created the infrastructures\n\n1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:10.400\n to allow continued research and development\n\n1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:13.040\n of additional science and medicine\n\n1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:14.680\n and various other kinds of things.\n\n1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:18.520\n The organizing principles that we use\n\n1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:21.840\n to govern all these things today have been,\n\n1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:25.520\n a lot of them have been just inherited\n\n1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:28.440\n from honestly medieval times.\n\n1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:30.160\n Some of them have refactored a little bit\n\n1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:31.920\n in the industrial era,\n\n1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:35.920\n but a lot of these modes of organizing people\n\n1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:38.280\n are deeply problematic.\n\n1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:41.640\n And furthermore, they're rooted in,\n\n1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:46.160\n I think, a very industrial mode perspective on human labor.\n\n1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:47.800\n And this is one of those things,\n\n1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:49.720\n I'm gonna go back to the open source thing.\n\n1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:51.920\n There was a point in time when,\n\n1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:53.640\n well, let me ask you this.\n\n1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:57.080\n If you look at the core SciPy sort of collection of libraries,\n\n1:40:57.080 --> 1:40:59.360\n so SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, right?\n\n1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:01.440\n There's iPython Notebook, let's throw pandas in there,\n\n1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:03.400\n scikit learn, a few of these things.\n\n1:41:03.400 --> 1:41:07.400\n How much value do you think, economic value,\n\n1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:09.400\n would you say they drive in the world today?\n\n1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:12.640\n That's one of the fascinating things\n\n1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:14.600\n about talking to you and Travis is like,\n\n1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.160\n it's a measure, it's like a...\n\n1:41:18.160 --> 1:41:20.080\n At least a billion dollars a day, maybe?\n\n1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:21.240\n A billion dollars, sure.\n\n1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:23.680\n I mean, it's like, it's similar question of like,\n\n1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:26.080\n how much value does Wikipedia create?\n\n1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:26.920\n Right.\n\n1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:30.520\n It's like, all of it, I don't know.\n\n1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:31.840\n Well, I mean, if you look at it,\n\n1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:33.440\n all of it, I don't know.\n\n1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:34.720\n Well, I mean, if you look at our systems,\n\n1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:36.120\n when you do a Google search, right?\n\n1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:37.760\n Now, some of that stuff runs through TensorFlow,\n\n1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:40.080\n but when you look at Siri,\n\n1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:42.080\n when you do credit card transaction fraud,\n\n1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:43.360\n like just everything, right?\n\n1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:45.240\n Every intelligence agency under the sun,\n\n1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:47.680\n they're using some aspect of these kinds of tools.\n\n1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:51.200\n So I would say that these create billions of dollars\n\n1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:52.040\n of value.\n\n1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:53.560\n Oh, you mean like direct use of tools\n\n1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:54.400\n that leverage this data?\n\n1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:55.240\n Yes, direct, yeah.\n\n1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:56.720\n Yeah, even that's billions a day, yeah.\n\n1:41:56.720 --> 1:41:58.800\n Yeah, right, easily, I think.\n\n1:41:58.800 --> 1:41:59.800\n Like the things they could not do\n\n1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.160\n if they didn't have these tools, right?\n\n1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:02.000\n Yes.\n\n1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.880\n So that's billions of dollars a day, great.\n\n1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:05.760\n I think that's about right.\n\n1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:07.880\n Now, if we take, how many people did it take\n\n1:42:07.880 --> 1:42:09.960\n to make that, right?\n\n1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:11.720\n And there was a point in time, not anymore,\n\n1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:12.960\n but there was a point in time when they could fit\n\n1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:13.800\n in a van.\n\n1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.960\n I could have fit them in my Mercedes winter, right?\n\n1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:19.240\n And so if you look at that, like, holy crap,\n\n1:42:19.240 --> 1:42:22.480\n literally a van of maybe a dozen people\n\n1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:27.480\n could create value to the tune of billions of dollars a day.\n\n1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:30.080\n What lesson do you draw from that?\n\n1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:31.400\n Well, here's the thing.\n\n1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:34.240\n What can we do to do more of that?\n\n1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:36.360\n Like that's open source.\n\n1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:39.760\n The way I've talked about this in other environments is\n\n1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:43.440\n when we use generative participatory crowdsourced\n\n1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:47.600\n approaches, we unlock human potential\n\n1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:50.840\n at a level that is better than what capitalism can do.\n\n1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:55.520\n I would challenge anyone to go and try to hire\n\n1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:58.360\n the right 12 people in the world\n\n1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:00.240\n to build that entire stack\n\n1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:02.520\n the way those 12 people did that, right?\n\n1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.160\n They would be very, very hard pressed to do that.\n\n1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:06.760\n If a hedge fund could just hire a dozen people\n\n1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:08.480\n and create like something that is worth\n\n1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:10.120\n billions of dollars a day,\n\n1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:12.400\n every single one of them would be racing to do it, right?\n\n1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:13.680\n But finding the right people,\n\n1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:15.160\n fostering the right collaborations,\n\n1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:16.840\n getting it adopted by the right other people\n\n1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:18.080\n to then refine it,\n\n1:43:18.080 --> 1:43:21.080\n that is a thing that was organic in nature.\n\n1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:22.200\n That took crowdsourcing.\n\n1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:24.160\n That took a lot of the open source ethos\n\n1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:26.480\n and it took the right kinds of people, right?\n\n1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:27.880\n Now those people who started that said,\n\n1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:30.880\n I need to have a part of a multi billion dollar a day\n\n1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:32.440\n sort of enterprise.\n\n1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:33.560\n They're like, I'm doing this cool thing\n\n1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:35.480\n to solve my problem for my friends, right?\n\n1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:37.880\n So the point of telling the story\n\n1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:40.760\n is to say that our way of thinking about value,\n\n1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:42.880\n our way of thinking about allocation of resources,\n\n1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:44.920\n our ways of thinking about property rights\n\n1:43:44.920 --> 1:43:46.200\n and all these kinds of things,\n\n1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:50.040\n they come from finite game, scarcity mentality,\n\n1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:52.160\n medieval institutions.\n\n1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:54.200\n As we are now entering,\n\n1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:57.080\n to some extent we're sort of in a post scarcity era,\n\n1:43:57.080 --> 1:43:59.800\n although some people are hoarding a whole lot of stuff.\n\n1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:02.200\n We are at a point where if not now soon,\n\n1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:03.920\n we'll be in a post scarcity era.\n\n1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:06.480\n The question of how we allocate resources\n\n1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:08.720\n has to be revisited at a fundamental level\n\n1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:11.000\n because the kind of software these people built,\n\n1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.960\n the modalities that those human ecologies\n\n1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:15.840\n that built that software,\n\n1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:17.960\n it treats offers unproperty.\n\n1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:20.480\n Actually sharing creates value.\n\n1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:23.080\n Restricting and forking reduces value.\n\n1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:26.360\n So that's different than any other physical resource\n\n1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:27.200\n that we've ever dealt with.\n\n1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:28.720\n It's different than how most corporations\n\n1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:31.240\n treat software IP, right?\n\n1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:34.600\n So if treating software in this way\n\n1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:37.560\n created this much value so efficiently, so cheaply,\n\n1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:39.160\n because feeding a dozen people for 10 years\n\n1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:41.640\n is really cheap, right?\n\n1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:44.680\n That's the reason I care about this right now\n\n1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:46.040\n is because looking forward\n\n1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:48.000\n when we can automate a lot of labor,\n\n1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:49.560\n where we can in fact,\n\n1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:52.200\n the programming for your robot in your part,\n\n1:44:52.200 --> 1:44:54.120\n neck of the woods and your part of the Amazon\n\n1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:55.960\n to build something sustainable for you\n\n1:44:55.960 --> 1:44:58.200\n and your tribe to deliver the right medicines,\n\n1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:00.240\n to take care of the kids,\n\n1:45:00.240 --> 1:45:02.880\n that's just software, that's just code\n\n1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:05.480\n that could be totally open sourced, right?\n\n1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:07.360\n So we can actually get to a mode\n\n1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:10.920\n where all of this additional generative things\n\n1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:12.400\n that humans are doing,\n\n1:45:12.400 --> 1:45:16.200\n they don't have to be wrapped up in a container\n\n1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:18.360\n and then we charge for all the exponential dynamics\n\n1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:19.200\n out of it.\n\n1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:20.400\n That's what Facebook did.\n\n1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:22.400\n That's what modern social media did, right?\n\n1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:24.920\n Because the old internet was connecting people just fine.\n\n1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:25.960\n So Facebook came along and said,\n\n1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:26.960\n well, anyone can post a picture,\n\n1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:28.440\n anyone can post some text\n\n1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:31.120\n and we're gonna amplify the crap out of it to everyone else.\n\n1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:33.280\n And it exploded this generative network\n\n1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:34.720\n of human interaction.\n\n1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:36.080\n And then I said, how do I make money off that?\n\n1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:38.160\n Oh yeah, I'm gonna be a gatekeeper\n\n1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:39.880\n on everybody's attention.\n\n1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:41.040\n And that's how I'm gonna make money.\n\n1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:45.640\n So how do we create more than one van?\n\n1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:47.840\n How do we have millions of vans full of people\n\n1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:51.000\n that create NumPy, SciPy, that create Python?\n\n1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:55.120\n So the story of those people is often they have\n\n1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:57.080\n some kind of job outside of this.\n\n1:45:57.080 --> 1:45:58.880\n This is what they're doing for fun.\n\n1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:00.960\n Don't you need to have a job?\n\n1:46:00.960 --> 1:46:02.240\n Don't you have to be connected,\n\n1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:04.960\n plugged in to the capitalist system?\n\n1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:05.800\n Isn't that what,\n\n1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:09.160\n isn't this consumerism,\n\n1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.880\n the engine that results in the individuals\n\n1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:15.880\n that kind of take a break from it every once in a while\n\n1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:17.320\n to create something magical?\n\n1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:19.160\n Like at the edges is where the innovation happens.\n\n1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:21.360\n There's a surplus, right, this is the question.\n\n1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:24.400\n Like if everyone were to go and run their own farm,\n\n1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:27.320\n no one would have time to go and write NumPy, SciPy, right?\n\n1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:29.960\n Maybe, but that's what I'm talking about\n\n1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:32.800\n when I say we're maybe at a post scarcity point\n\n1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:34.160\n for a lot of people.\n\n1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:37.240\n The question that we're never encouraged to ask\n\n1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:40.640\n in a Super Bowl ad is how much do you need?\n\n1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:41.960\n How much is enough?\n\n1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:45.040\n Do you need to have a new car every two years, every five?\n\n1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:46.160\n If you have a reliable car,\n\n1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:48.480\n can you drive one for 10 years, is that all right?\n\n1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:50.520\n I had a car for 10 years and it was fine.\n\n1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:52.800\n Your iPhone, do you have to upgrade every two years?\n\n1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:54.320\n I mean, it's sort of, you're using the same apps\n\n1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:56.680\n you did four years ago, right?\n\n1:46:56.680 --> 1:46:58.320\n This should be a Super Bowl ad.\n\n1:46:58.320 --> 1:46:59.680\n This should be a Super Bowl ad, that's great.\n\n1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:01.400\n Maybe somebody. Do you really need a new iPhone?\n\n1:47:01.400 --> 1:47:03.920\n Maybe one of our listeners will fund something like this\n\n1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:06.960\n of like, no, but just actually bringing it back,\n\n1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:09.440\n bringing it back to actually the question\n\n1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:11.480\n of what do you need?\n\n1:47:11.480 --> 1:47:13.560\n How do we create the infrastructure\n\n1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:17.640\n for collectives of people to live on the basis\n\n1:47:17.640 --> 1:47:21.000\n of providing what we need, meeting people's needs\n\n1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.200\n with a little bit of access to handle emergencies,\n\n1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:26.320\n things like that, pulling our resources together\n\n1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:28.760\n to handle the really, really big emergencies,\n\n1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:30.880\n somebody with a really rare form of cancer\n\n1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:34.120\n or some massive fire sweeps through half the village\n\n1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:38.200\n or whatever, but can we actually unscale things\n\n1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:41.560\n and solve for people's needs\n\n1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:45.160\n and then give them the capacity to explore\n\n1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:47.320\n how to be the best version of themselves?\n\n1:47:47.320 --> 1:47:51.000\n And for Travis, that was throwing away his shot of tenure\n\n1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:52.880\n in order to write NumPy.\n\n1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:56.840\n For others, there is a saying in the SciFi community\n\n1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:59.800\n that SciFi advances one failed postdoc at a time.\n\n1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:03.800\n And that's, we can do these things.\n\n1:48:03.800 --> 1:48:05.600\n We can actually do this kind of collaboration\n\n1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:08.360\n because code, software, information, organization,\n\n1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:09.880\n that's cheap.\n\n1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:13.000\n Those bits are very cheap to fling across the oceans.\n\n1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:14.760\n So you mentioned Travis.\n\n1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:16.560\n We've been talking and we'll continue to talk\n\n1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:17.720\n about open source.\n\n1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:20.440\n Maybe you can comment.\n\n1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:21.960\n How did you meet Travis?\n\n1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:24.080\n Who is Travis Aliphant?\n\n1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:27.400\n What's your relationship been like through the years?\n\n1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:30.160\n Where did you work together?\n\n1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:31.800\n How did you meet?\n\n1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:35.120\n What's the present and the future look like?\n\n1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:36.600\n Yeah, so the first time I met Travis\n\n1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:39.360\n was at a SciFi conference in Pasadena.\n\n1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:40.920\n Do you remember the year?\n\n1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:42.040\n 2005.\n\n1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:44.400\n I was working at, again, at nthought,\n\n1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:47.000\n working on scientific computing consulting.\n\n1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.160\n And a couple of years later,\n\n1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:54.040\n he joined us at nthought, I think 2007.\n\n1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:58.240\n And he came in as the president.\n\n1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:01.880\n One of the founders of nthought was the CEO, Eric Jones.\n\n1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:04.080\n And we were all very excited that Travis was joining us\n\n1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:05.080\n and that was great fun.\n\n1:49:05.080 --> 1:49:06.960\n And so I worked with Travis\n\n1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:08.920\n on a number of consulting projects\n\n1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:12.120\n and we worked on some open source stuff.\n\n1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:15.080\n I mean, it was just a really, it was a good time there.\n\n1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:15.920\n And then...\n\n1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:17.840\n It was primarily Python related?\n\n1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:19.800\n Oh yeah, it was all Python, NumPy, SciFi consulting\n\n1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:21.000\n kind of stuff.\n\n1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.240\n Towards the end of that time,\n\n1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:27.720\n we started getting called into more and more finance shops.\n\n1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:29.840\n They were adopting Python pretty heavily.\n\n1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:33.320\n I did some work on like a high frequency trading shop,\n\n1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:34.160\n working on some stuff.\n\n1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:36.520\n And then we worked together on some,\n\n1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:39.840\n at a couple of investment banks in Manhattan.\n\n1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:42.680\n And so we started seeing that there was a potential\n\n1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:45.720\n to take Python in the direction of business computing,\n\n1:49:45.720 --> 1:49:48.120\n more than just being this niche like MATLAB replacement\n\n1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:50.520\n for big vector computing.\n\n1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:51.800\n What we were seeing was, oh yeah,\n\n1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:53.880\n you could actually use Python as a Swiss army knife\n\n1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:56.840\n to do a lot of shadow data transformation kind of stuff.\n\n1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:00.520\n So that's when we realized the potential is much greater.\n\n1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:03.360\n And so we started Anaconda,\n\n1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:05.240\n I mean, it was called Continuum Analytics at the time,\n\n1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:07.520\n but we started in January of 2012\n\n1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:10.760\n with a vision of shoring up the parts of Python\n\n1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:13.760\n that needed to get expanded to handle data at scale,\n\n1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:17.200\n to do web visualization, application development, et cetera.\n\n1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:18.040\n And that was that, yeah.\n\n1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:23.040\n So he was CEO and I was president for the first five years.\n\n1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:27.480\n And then we raised some money and then the board,\n\n1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:28.960\n it was sort of put in a new CEO.\n\n1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:31.320\n They hired a kind of professional CEO.\n\n1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:34.080\n And then Travis, you laugh at that.\n\n1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:35.240\n I took over the CTO role.\n\n1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:37.920\n Travis then left after a year to do his own thing,\n\n1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:41.120\n to do Quonsight, which was more oriented\n\n1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:43.920\n around some of the bootstrap years that we did at Continuum\n\n1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.200\n where it was open source and consulting.\n\n1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:48.600\n It wasn't sort of like gung ho product development.\n\n1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:50.120\n And it wasn't focused on,\n\n1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:51.120\n we accidentally stumbled\n\n1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:55.560\n into the package management problem at Anaconda,\n\n1:50:55.560 --> 1:50:57.760\n but we had a lot of other visions of other technology\n\n1:50:57.760 --> 1:50:58.920\n that we built in the open source.\n\n1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:02.080\n And Travis was really trying to push,\n\n1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:04.160\n again, the frontiers of numerical computing,\n\n1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:05.320\n vector computing,\n\n1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:07.720\n handling things like auto differentiation and stuff\n\n1:51:07.720 --> 1:51:09.960\n intrinsically in the open ecosystem.\n\n1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:14.320\n So I think that's kind of the direction\n\n1:51:14.320 --> 1:51:18.280\n he's working on in some of his work.\n\n1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:22.520\n We remain great friends and colleagues and collaborators,\n\n1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:25.760\n even though he's no longer day to day working at Anaconda,\n\n1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:27.000\n but he gives me a lot of feedback\n\n1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000\n about this and that and the other.\n\n1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:32.200\n What's a big lesson you've learned from Travis\n\n1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:35.440\n about life or about programming or about leadership?\n\n1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:36.480\n Wow, there's a lot.\n\n1:51:36.480 --> 1:51:37.320\n There's a lot.\n\n1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:39.600\n Travis is a really, really good guy.\n\n1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:41.920\n He really, his heart is really in it.\n\n1:51:41.920 --> 1:51:43.080\n He cares a lot.\n\n1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:46.920\n I've gotten that sense having to interact with him.\n\n1:51:46.920 --> 1:51:47.760\n It's so interesting.\n\n1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:48.600\n Such a good human being.\n\n1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:49.720\n He's a really good dude.\n\n1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:51.360\n And he and I, it's so interesting.\n\n1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:53.240\n We come from very different backgrounds.\n\n1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:54.920\n We're quite different as people,\n\n1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.800\n but I think we can like not talk for a long time\n\n1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:03.280\n and then be on a conversation\n\n1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:06.400\n and be eye to eye on like 90% of things.\n\n1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:08.280\n And so he's someone who I believe\n\n1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:10.600\n no matter how much fog settles in over the ocean,\n\n1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:12.200\n his ship, my ship are pointed\n\n1:52:12.200 --> 1:52:14.120\n sort of in the same direction of the same star.\n\n1:52:14.120 --> 1:52:16.840\n Wow, that's a beautiful way to phrase it.\n\n1:52:16.840 --> 1:52:18.600\n No matter how much fog there is,\n\n1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:20.400\n we're pointed at the same star.\n\n1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:21.880\n Yeah, and I hope he feels the same way.\n\n1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:23.760\n I mean, I hope he knows that over the years now.\n\n1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:27.000\n We both care a lot about the community.\n\n1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:28.120\n For someone who cares so deeply,\n\n1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:29.880\n I would say this about Travis that's interesting.\n\n1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:33.360\n For someone who cares so deeply about the nerd details\n\n1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:36.000\n of like type system design and vector computing\n\n1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.760\n and efficiency of expressing this and that and the other,\n\n1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:40.440\n memory layouts and all that stuff,\n\n1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:43.280\n he cares even more about the people\n\n1:52:43.280 --> 1:52:45.880\n in the ecosystem, the community.\n\n1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:49.760\n And I have a similar kind of alignment.\n\n1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:53.080\n I care a lot about the tech, I really do.\n\n1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:58.080\n But for me, the beauty of what this human ecology\n\n1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:01.680\n has produced is I think a touchstone.\n\n1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:03.600\n It's an early version, we can look at it and say,\n\n1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:05.800\n how do we replicate this for humanity at scale?\n\n1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:08.760\n What this open source collaboration was able to produce?\n\n1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:11.600\n How can we be generative in human collaboration\n\n1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:12.760\n moving forward and create that\n\n1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:15.080\n as a civilizational kind of dynamic?\n\n1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:17.440\n Like, can we seize this moment to do that?\n\n1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:19.720\n Because like a lot of the other open source movements,\n\n1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:21.960\n it's all nerds nerding out on code for nerds.\n\n1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:25.840\n And this because it's scientists,\n\n1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:27.160\n because it's people working on data,\n\n1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:30.080\n that all of it faces real human problems.\n\n1:53:31.480 --> 1:53:32.600\n I think we have an opportunity\n\n1:53:32.600 --> 1:53:34.360\n to actually make a bigger impact.\n\n1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:37.480\n Is there a way for this kind of open source vision\n\n1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:39.040\n to make money?\n\n1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:40.080\n Absolutely.\n\n1:53:40.080 --> 1:53:41.640\n To fund the people involved?\n\n1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:43.040\n Is that an essential part of it?\n\n1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:45.640\n It's hard, but we're trying to do that\n\n1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:48.560\n in our own way at Anaconda,\n\n1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:49.880\n because we know that business users,\n\n1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:52.000\n as they use more of the stuff, they have needs,\n\n1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.840\n like business specific needs around security, provenance.\n\n1:53:54.840 --> 1:53:59.200\n They really can't tell their VPs and their investors,\n\n1:53:59.200 --> 1:54:01.040\n hey, we're having, our data scientists\n\n1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:03.520\n are installing random packages from who knows where\n\n1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:04.680\n and running on customer data.\n\n1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:05.920\n So they have to have someone to talk to you.\n\n1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:07.360\n And that's what Anaconda does.\n\n1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:10.400\n So we are a governed source of packages for them,\n\n1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:12.160\n and that's great, that makes some money.\n\n1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:16.160\n We take some of that and we just take that as a dividend.\n\n1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:17.200\n We take a percentage of our revenues\n\n1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:20.000\n and write that as a dividend for the open source community.\n\n1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:23.440\n But beyond that, I really see the development\n\n1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:27.560\n of a marketplace for people to create notebooks,\n\n1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:30.840\n models, data sets, curation of these different kinds\n\n1:54:30.840 --> 1:54:33.120\n of things, and to really have\n\n1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:36.320\n a long tail marketplace dynamic with that.\n\n1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:38.800\n Can you speak about this problem\n\n1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:41.800\n that you stumbled into of package management,\n\n1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:43.120\n Python package management?\n\n1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:44.080\n What is that?\n\n1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:48.160\n A lot of people speak very highly of Conda,\n\n1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:50.720\n which is part of Anaconda, which is a package manager.\n\n1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:52.400\n There's a ton of packages.\n\n1:54:52.400 --> 1:54:55.080\n So first, what are package managers?\n\n1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:57.240\n And second, what was there before?\n\n1:54:57.240 --> 1:54:58.600\n What is pip?\n\n1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:01.840\n And why is Conda more awesome?\n\n1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:04.200\n The package problem is this, which is that\n\n1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:09.200\n in order to do numerical computing efficiently with Python,\n\n1:55:11.640 --> 1:55:14.480\n there are a lot of low level libraries\n\n1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:17.400\n that need to be compiled, compiled with a C compiler\n\n1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:19.880\n or C++ compiler or Fortran compiler.\n\n1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:21.120\n They need to not just be compiled,\n\n1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:23.680\n but they need to be compiled with all of the right settings.\n\n1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:25.200\n And oftentimes those settings are tuned\n\n1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:27.440\n for specific chip architectures.\n\n1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:29.320\n And when you add GPUs to the mix,\n\n1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:32.280\n when you look at different operating systems,\n\n1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:33.800\n you may be on the same chip,\n\n1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:37.200\n but if you're running Mac versus Linux versus Windows\n\n1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:40.040\n on the same x86 chip, you compile and link differently.\n\n1:55:40.040 --> 1:55:44.800\n All of this complexity is beyond the capability\n\n1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:46.720\n of most data scientists to reason about.\n\n1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:50.240\n And it's also beyond what most of the package developers\n\n1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:51.880\n want to deal with too.\n\n1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:52.840\n Because if you're a package developer,\n\n1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:54.280\n you're like, I code on Linux.\n\n1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:55.840\n This works for me, I'm good.\n\n1:55:55.840 --> 1:55:58.080\n It is not my problem to figure out how to build this\n\n1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:00.040\n on an ancient version of Windows, right?\n\n1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:01.920\n That's just simply not my problem.\n\n1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:05.120\n So what we end up with is we have a creator economy\n\n1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:08.560\n or create a very creative crowdsourced environment\n\n1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:11.160\n where people want to use this stuff, but they can't.\n\n1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:15.720\n And so we ended up creating a new set of technologies\n\n1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:18.400\n like a build recipe system, a build system\n\n1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:21.480\n and an installer system that is able to,\n\n1:56:22.520 --> 1:56:24.640\n well, to put it simply,\n\n1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:27.680\n it's able to build these packages correctly\n\n1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:29.320\n on each of these different kinds of platforms\n\n1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:30.320\n and operating systems,\n\n1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:33.040\n and make it so when people want to install something,\n\n1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:34.400\n they can, it's just one command.\n\n1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:36.960\n They don't have to set up a big compiler system\n\n1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:38.320\n and do all these things.\n\n1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:40.440\n So when it works well, it works great.\n\n1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:43.920\n Now, the difficulty is we have literally thousands\n\n1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:46.280\n of people writing code in the ecosystem,\n\n1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:48.760\n building all sorts of stuff and each person writing code,\n\n1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:50.640\n they may take a dependence on something else.\n\n1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:52.280\n And so you have all this web,\n\n1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:54.840\n incredibly complex web of dependencies.\n\n1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:57.640\n So installing the correct package\n\n1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:00.360\n for any given set of packages you want,\n\n1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:04.600\n getting that right subgraph is an incredibly hard problem.\n\n1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:05.800\n And again, most data scientists\n\n1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:06.640\n don't want to think about this.\n\n1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:09.160\n They're like, I want to install NumPy and pandas.\n\n1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:11.720\n I want this version of some like geospatial library.\n\n1:57:11.720 --> 1:57:13.080\n I want this other thing.\n\n1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:14.000\n Like, why is this hard?\n\n1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:15.680\n These exist, right?\n\n1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:17.680\n And it is hard because it's, well,\n\n1:57:17.680 --> 1:57:20.760\n you're installing this on a version of Windows, right?\n\n1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:23.400\n And half of these libraries are not built for Windows\n\n1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:25.120\n or the latest version isn't available,\n\n1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:26.240\n but the old version was.\n\n1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:27.560\n And if you go to the old version of this library,\n\n1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:28.600\n that means you need to go to a different version\n\n1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:30.040\n of that library.\n\n1:57:30.040 --> 1:57:32.480\n And so the Python ecosystem,\n\n1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:34.480\n by virtue of being crowdsourced,\n\n1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:38.000\n we were able to fill a hundred thousand different niches.\n\n1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.360\n But then we also suffer this problem\n\n1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:43.120\n that because it's crowdsourced and no one,\n\n1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:44.480\n it's like a tragedy of the commons, right?\n\n1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:47.080\n No one really needs, wants to support\n\n1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:49.200\n their thousands of other dependencies.\n\n1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:52.160\n So we end up sort of having to do a lot of this.\n\n1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:53.480\n And of course the conda forge community\n\n1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:55.640\n also steps up as an open source community that,\n\n1:57:55.640 --> 1:57:57.520\n you know, maintain some of these recipes.\n\n1:57:57.520 --> 1:57:58.680\n That's what conda does.\n\n1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:01.880\n Now, pip is a tool that came along after conda,\n\n1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:04.480\n to some extent, it came along as an easier way\n\n1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:09.480\n for the Python developers writing Python code\n\n1:58:09.520 --> 1:58:12.920\n that didn't have as much compiled, you know, stuff.\n\n1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:15.360\n They could then install different packages.\n\n1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:17.800\n And what ended up happening in the Python ecosystem\n\n1:58:17.800 --> 1:58:20.800\n was that a lot of the core Python and web Python developers,\n\n1:58:20.800 --> 1:58:24.160\n they never ran into any of this compilation stuff at all.\n\n1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:27.040\n So even we have, you know, on video,\n\n1:58:27.040 --> 1:58:29.520\n we have Guido van Rossum saying,\n\n1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:31.600\n you know what, the scientific community's packaging problems\n\n1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:33.160\n are just too exotic and different.\n\n1:58:33.160 --> 1:58:35.680\n I mean, you're talking about Fortran compilers, right?\n\n1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:37.680\n Like you guys just need to build your own solution\n\n1:58:37.680 --> 1:58:38.960\n perhaps, right?\n\n1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:41.720\n So the Python core Python community went\n\n1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:45.320\n and built its own sort of packaging technologies,\n\n1:58:45.320 --> 1:58:47.880\n not really contemplating the complexity\n\n1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:49.280\n of this stuff over here.\n\n1:58:49.280 --> 1:58:51.560\n And so now we have the challenge where\n\n1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:53.600\n you can pip install some things, some libraries,\n\n1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:55.280\n if you just want to get started with them,\n\n1:58:55.280 --> 1:58:57.560\n you can pip install TensorFlow and that works great.\n\n1:58:57.560 --> 1:59:00.200\n The instant you want to also install some other packages\n\n1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:02.560\n that use different versions of NumPy\n\n1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:05.560\n or some like graphics library or some OpenCV thing\n\n1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:08.720\n or some other thing, you now run into dependency hell\n\n1:59:08.720 --> 1:59:09.880\n because you cannot, you know,\n\n1:59:09.880 --> 1:59:12.800\n OpenCV can have a different version of libjpeg over here\n\n1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:14.320\n than PyTorch over here.\n\n1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:15.800\n Like they actually, they all have to use the,\n\n1:59:15.800 --> 1:59:17.400\n if you want to use GPU acceleration,\n\n1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:18.840\n they have to all use the same underlying drivers\n\n1:59:18.840 --> 1:59:20.400\n and same GPU CUDA things.\n\n1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:22.960\n So it's, it gets to be very gnarly\n\n1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:24.240\n and it's a level of technology\n\n1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:26.120\n that both the makers and the users\n\n1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:28.560\n don't really want to think too much about.\n\n1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:30.480\n And that's where you step in and try to solve this.\n\n1:59:30.480 --> 1:59:31.320\n We try to solve it.\n\n1:59:31.320 --> 1:59:32.160\n Subgraph problems.\n\n1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:33.000\n How much is that?\n\n1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:34.960\n I mean, you said that you don't want to think,\n\n1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:35.960\n they don't want to think about it,\n\n1:59:35.960 --> 1:59:38.000\n but how much is it a little bit on the developer\n\n1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:42.440\n and providing them tools to be a little bit more clear\n\n1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:44.920\n of that subgraph of dependency that's necessary?\n\n1:59:44.920 --> 1:59:47.920\n It is getting to a point where we do have to think about,\n\n1:59:47.920 --> 1:59:51.280\n look, can we pull some of the most popular packages together\n\n1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:53.640\n and get them to work on a coordinated release timeline,\n\n1:59:53.640 --> 1:59:55.880\n get them to build against the same test matrix,\n\n1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:57.000\n et cetera, et cetera, right?\n\n1:59:57.000 --> 1:59:58.780\n And there is a little bit of dynamic around this,\n\n1:59:58.780 --> 2:00:01.880\n but again, it is a volunteer community.\n\n2:00:01.880 --> 2:00:02.720\n Yeah.\n\n2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:04.980\n You know, people working on these different projects\n\n2:00:04.980 --> 2:00:06.040\n have their own timelines\n\n2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:07.600\n and their own things they're trying to meet.\n\n2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:11.360\n So we end up trying to pull these things together.\n\n2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:13.080\n And then it's this incredibly,\n\n2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:15.440\n and I would recommend just as a business tip,\n\n2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:16.560\n don't ever go into business\n\n2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:19.600\n where when your hard work works, you're invisible.\n\n2:00:19.600 --> 2:00:21.720\n And when it breaks because of someone else's problem,\n\n2:00:21.720 --> 2:00:23.200\n you get flagged for it.\n\n2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:25.640\n Because that's in our situation, right?\n\n2:00:25.640 --> 2:00:27.280\n When something doesn't condensate all properly,\n\n2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:28.980\n usually it's some upstream issue,\n\n2:00:28.980 --> 2:00:30.280\n but it looks like condensate is broken.\n\n2:00:30.280 --> 2:00:32.640\n It looks like, you know, Anaconda screwed something up.\n\n2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:34.560\n When things do work though, it's like, oh yeah, cool.\n\n2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:35.400\n It's worked.\n\n2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:36.240\n Assuming naturally, of course,\n\n2:00:36.240 --> 2:00:38.200\n it's very easy to make that work, right?\n\n2:00:38.200 --> 2:00:41.960\n So we end up in this kind of problematic scenario,\n\n2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:45.040\n but it's okay because I think we're still,\n\n2:00:45.040 --> 2:00:46.760\n you know, our heart's in the right place.\n\n2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:47.840\n We're trying to move this forward\n\n2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:49.220\n as a community sort of affair.\n\n2:00:49.220 --> 2:00:50.520\n I think most of the people in the community\n\n2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:53.000\n also appreciate the work we've done over the years\n\n2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:54.280\n to try to move these things forward\n\n2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:57.320\n in a collaborative fashion, so.\n\n2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:01.200\n One of the subgraphs of dependencies\n\n2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:03.560\n that became super complicated\n\n2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:05.760\n is the move from Python 2 to Python 3.\n\n2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:07.200\n So there's all these ways to mess\n\n2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:11.520\n with these kinds of ecosystems of packages and so on.\n\n2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:13.760\n So I just want to ask you about that particular one.\n\n2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:18.000\n What do you think about the move from Python 2 to 3?\n\n2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:19.440\n Why did it take so long?\n\n2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:20.960\n What were, from your perspective,\n\n2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:23.700\n just seeing the packages all struggle\n\n2:01:23.700 --> 2:01:26.280\n and the community all struggle through this process,\n\n2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:27.840\n what lessons do you take away from it?\n\n2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:29.480\n Why did it take so long?\n\n2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:33.380\n Looking back, some people perhaps underestimated\n\n2:01:33.380 --> 2:01:36.760\n how much adoption Python 2 had.\n\n2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:41.800\n I think some people also underestimated how much,\n\n2:01:41.800 --> 2:01:44.440\n or they overestimated how much value\n\n2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:47.400\n some of the new features in Python 3 really provided.\n\n2:01:47.400 --> 2:01:49.720\n Like the things they really loved about Python 3\n\n2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:52.600\n just didn't matter to some of these people in Python 2.\n\n2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:56.440\n Because this change was happening as Python, SciPy,\n\n2:01:56.440 --> 2:01:58.700\n was starting to take off really like past,\n\n2:01:58.700 --> 2:02:00.000\n like a hockey stick of adoption\n\n2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.880\n in the early data science era, in the early 2010s.\n\n2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:04.880\n A lot of people were learning and onboarding\n\n2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:06.280\n in whatever just worked.\n\n2:02:06.280 --> 2:02:07.180\n And the teachers were like,\n\n2:02:07.180 --> 2:02:09.080\n well, yeah, these libraries I need\n\n2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:10.360\n are not supported in Python 3 yet,\n\n2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:12.040\n I'm going to teach you Python 2.\n\n2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:13.960\n Took a lot of advocacy to get people\n\n2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:15.700\n to move over to Python 3.\n\n2:02:15.700 --> 2:02:18.860\n So I think it wasn't any particular single thing,\n\n2:02:18.860 --> 2:02:21.820\n but it was one of those death by a dozen cuts,\n\n2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:25.480\n which just really made it hard to move off of Python 2.\n\n2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:27.280\n And also Python 3 itself,\n\n2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:28.820\n as they were kind of breaking things\n\n2:02:28.820 --> 2:02:29.660\n and changing things around\n\n2:02:29.660 --> 2:02:30.720\n and reorganizing the standard library,\n\n2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:32.920\n there's a lot of stuff that was happening there\n\n2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:35.880\n that kept giving people an excuse to say,\n\n2:02:35.880 --> 2:02:37.760\n I'll put off till the next version.\n\n2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:39.680\n 2 is working fine enough for me right now.\n\n2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:41.480\n So I think that's essentially what happened there.\n\n2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:43.760\n And I will say this though,\n\n2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:48.660\n the strength of the Python data science movement,\n\n2:02:48.660 --> 2:02:52.440\n I think is what kept Python alive in that transition.\n\n2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:54.040\n Because a lot of languages have died\n\n2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:56.840\n and left their user bases behind.\n\n2:02:56.840 --> 2:02:58.980\n If there wasn't the use of Python for data,\n\n2:02:58.980 --> 2:03:01.160\n there's a good chunk of Python users\n\n2:03:01.160 --> 2:03:02.740\n that during that transition,\n\n2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:04.920\n would have just left for Go and Rust and stayed.\n\n2:03:04.920 --> 2:03:06.220\n In fact, some people did.\n\n2:03:06.220 --> 2:03:08.880\n They moved to Go and Rust and they just never looked back.\n\n2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:13.720\n The fact that we were able to grow by millions of users,\n\n2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:15.820\n the Python data community,\n\n2:03:15.820 --> 2:03:18.320\n that is what kept the momentum for Python going.\n\n2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:21.760\n And now the usage of Python for data is over 50%\n\n2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:24.320\n of the overall Python user base.\n\n2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:27.960\n So I'm happy to debate that on stage somewhere,\n\n2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:29.920\n I don't know if they really wanna take issue\n\n2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:31.600\n with that statement, but from where I sit,\n\n2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:32.560\n I think that's true.\n\n2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:35.280\n The statement there, the idea is that the switch\n\n2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:39.040\n from Python 2 to Python 3 would have probably\n\n2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:43.600\n destroyed Python if it didn't also coincide with Python\n\n2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:45.780\n for whatever reason,\n\n2:03:45.780 --> 2:03:49.680\n just overtaking the data science community,\n\n2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:51.800\n anything that processes data.\n\n2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:55.760\n So like the timing was perfect that this maybe\n\n2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:59.080\n imperfect decision was coupled with a great timing\n\n2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:02.080\n on the value of data in our world.\n\n2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:04.780\n I would say the troubled execution of a good decision.\n\n2:04:04.780 --> 2:04:07.360\n It was a decision that was necessary.\n\n2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:08.840\n It's possible if we had more resources,\n\n2:04:08.840 --> 2:04:11.120\n we could have done in a way that was a little bit smoother,\n\n2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:15.200\n but ultimately, the arguments for Python 3,\n\n2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:17.400\n I bought them at the time and I buy them now, right?\n\n2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:20.800\n Having great text handling is like a nonnegotiable\n\n2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:23.440\n table stakes thing you need to have in a language.\n\n2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:28.440\n So that's great, but the execution,\n\n2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:33.000\n Python is the, it's volunteer driven.\n\n2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.880\n It's like now the most popular language on the planet,\n\n2:04:34.880 --> 2:04:37.080\n but it's all literally volunteers.\n\n2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:40.400\n So the lack of resources meant that they had to really,\n\n2:04:40.400 --> 2:04:43.600\n they had to do things in a very hamstrung way.\n\n2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:46.720\n And I think to carry the Python momentum in the language\n\n2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:48.460\n through that time, the data movement\n\n2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:49.920\n was a critical part of that.\n\n2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:54.080\n So some of it is carrot and stick, I actually have to\n\n2:04:54.080 --> 2:04:57.040\n shamefully admit that it took me a very long time\n\n2:04:57.040 --> 2:04:58.760\n to switch from Python 2 and Python 3\n\n2:04:58.760 --> 2:05:00.320\n because I'm a machine learning person.\n\n2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:01.960\n It was just for the longest time,\n\n2:05:01.960 --> 2:05:03.820\n you could just do fine with Python 2.\n\n2:05:03.820 --> 2:05:04.960\n Right.\n\n2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:09.200\n But I think the moment where I switched everybody\n\n2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:13.080\n I worked with and switched myself for small projects\n\n2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:17.700\n and big is when finally, when NumPy announced\n\n2:05:17.700 --> 2:05:21.480\n that they're going to end support like in 2020\n\n2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:22.320\n or something like that.\n\n2:05:22.320 --> 2:05:23.160\n Right.\n\n2:05:23.160 --> 2:05:26.200\n So like when I realized, oh, this isn't going,\n\n2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:27.400\n this is going to end.\n\n2:05:27.400 --> 2:05:28.240\n Right.\n\n2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:29.720\n So that's the stick, that's not a carrot.\n\n2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:31.720\n That's not, so for the longest time it was carrots.\n\n2:05:31.720 --> 2:05:34.420\n It was like all of these packages were saying,\n\n2:05:34.420 --> 2:05:37.460\n okay, we have Python 3 support now, come join us.\n\n2:05:37.460 --> 2:05:40.120\n We have Python 2 and Python 3, but when NumPy,\n\n2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:43.440\n one of the packages I sort of love and depend on\n\n2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:47.660\n said like, nope, it's over.\n\n2:05:47.660 --> 2:05:50.360\n That's when I decided to switch.\n\n2:05:50.360 --> 2:05:53.840\n I wonder if you think it was possible much earlier\n\n2:05:53.840 --> 2:05:58.840\n for somebody like NumPy or some major package\n\n2:05:58.840 --> 2:06:03.840\n to step into the cold and say like we're ending this.\n\n2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:05.320\n Well, it's a chicken and egg problem too, right?\n\n2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:07.580\n You don't want to cut off a lot of users\n\n2:06:07.580 --> 2:06:09.400\n unless you see the user momentum going too.\n\n2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:12.900\n So the decisions for the scientific community\n\n2:06:12.900 --> 2:06:14.080\n for each of the different projects,\n\n2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:15.280\n you know, there's not a monolith.\n\n2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:17.000\n Some projects are like, we'll only be releasing\n\n2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:18.920\n new features on Python 3.\n\n2:06:18.920 --> 2:06:21.400\n And that was more of a sticky carrot, right?\n\n2:06:21.400 --> 2:06:23.520\n A firm carrot, if you will, a firm carrot.\n\n2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:27.960\n A stick shaped carrot.\n\n2:06:27.960 --> 2:06:30.680\n But then for others, yeah, NumPy in particular,\n\n2:06:30.680 --> 2:06:32.680\n cause it's at the base of the dependency stack\n\n2:06:32.680 --> 2:06:36.160\n for so many things, that was the final stick.\n\n2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:37.600\n That was a stick shaped stick.\n\n2:06:37.600 --> 2:06:40.080\n People were saying, look, if I have to keep maintaining\n\n2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:43.640\n my releases for Python 2, that's that much less energy\n\n2:06:43.640 --> 2:06:45.700\n that I can put into making things better\n\n2:06:45.700 --> 2:06:48.160\n for the Python 3 folks or in my new version,\n\n2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:49.920\n which is of course going to be Python 3.\n\n2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:53.320\n So people were also getting kind of pulled by this tension.\n\n2:06:53.320 --> 2:06:56.140\n So the overall community sort of had a lot of input\n\n2:06:56.140 --> 2:06:58.480\n into when the NumPy core folks decided\n\n2:06:58.480 --> 2:07:01.380\n that they would end of life on Python 2.\n\n2:07:01.380 --> 2:07:04.000\n So as these numbers are a little bit loose,\n\n2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.840\n but there are about 10 million Python programmers\n\n2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:08.400\n in the world, you could argue that number,\n\n2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:10.320\n but let's say 10 million.\n\n2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:12.280\n That's actually where I was looking,\n\n2:07:12.280 --> 2:07:17.240\n said 27 million total programmers, developers in the world.\n\n2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:20.540\n You mentioned in a talk that changes need to be made\n\n2:07:20.540 --> 2:07:24.000\n for there to be 100 million Python programmers.\n\n2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.020\n So first of all, do you see a future\n\n2:07:26.020 --> 2:07:28.280\n where there's 100 million Python programmers?\n\n2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:31.320\n And second, what kind of changes need to be made?\n\n2:07:31.320 --> 2:07:33.200\n So Anaconda and Miniconda get downloaded\n\n2:07:33.200 --> 2:07:34.880\n about a million times a week.\n\n2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:37.720\n So I think the idea that there's only\n\n2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:39.320\n 10 million Python programmers in the world\n\n2:07:39.320 --> 2:07:41.960\n is a little bit undercounting.\n\n2:07:41.960 --> 2:07:44.860\n There are a lot of people who escape traditional counting\n\n2:07:44.860 --> 2:07:48.440\n that are using Python and data in their jobs.\n\n2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:52.100\n I do believe that the future world for it to,\n\n2:07:52.100 --> 2:07:53.280\n well, the world I would like to see\n\n2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:56.240\n is one where people are data literate.\n\n2:07:56.240 --> 2:07:58.600\n So they are able to use tools\n\n2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:02.060\n that let them express their questions and ideas fluidly.\n\n2:08:03.180 --> 2:08:06.440\n And the data variety and data complexity will not go down.\n\n2:08:06.440 --> 2:08:08.320\n It will only keep increasing.\n\n2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:12.460\n So I think some level of code or code like things\n\n2:08:12.460 --> 2:08:15.460\n will continue to be relevant.\n\n2:08:15.460 --> 2:08:19.760\n And so my hope is that we can build systems\n\n2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:22.900\n that allow people to more seamlessly integrate\n\n2:08:22.900 --> 2:08:26.040\n Python kinds of expressivity with data systems\n\n2:08:26.040 --> 2:08:30.000\n and operationalization methods that are much more seamless.\n\n2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:32.380\n And what I mean by that is, you know,\n\n2:08:32.380 --> 2:08:35.660\n right now you can't punch Python code into an Excel cell.\n\n2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:37.960\n I mean, there's some tools you can do to kind of do this.\n\n2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:39.920\n We didn't build a thing for doing this back in the day,\n\n2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:43.820\n but I feel like the total addressable market\n\n2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:46.860\n for Python users, if we do the things right,\n\n2:08:46.860 --> 2:08:49.080\n is on the order of the Excel users,\n\n2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:51.180\n which is, you know, a few hundred million.\n\n2:08:51.180 --> 2:08:56.180\n So I think Python has to get better at being embedded,\n\n2:08:57.300 --> 2:08:59.660\n you know, being a smaller thing that pulls in\n\n2:08:59.660 --> 2:09:01.720\n just the right parts of the ecosystem\n\n2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:05.560\n to run numerics and do data exploration,\n\n2:09:05.560 --> 2:09:07.920\n meeting people where they're already at\n\n2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:09.640\n with their data and their data tools.\n\n2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:12.800\n And then I think also it has to be easier\n\n2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:14.720\n to take some of those things they've written\n\n2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:17.540\n and flow those back into deployed systems\n\n2:09:17.540 --> 2:09:19.460\n or little apps or visualizations.\n\n2:09:19.460 --> 2:09:20.720\n I think if we don't do those things,\n\n2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:23.160\n then we will always be kept in a silo\n\n2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:25.920\n as sort of an expert user's tool\n\n2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:27.400\n and not a tool for the masses.\n\n2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:28.960\n You know, I work with a bunch of folks\n\n2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:32.520\n in the Adobe Creative Suite,\n\n2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:35.400\n and I'm kind of forcing them or inspired them\n\n2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:38.560\n to learn Python, to do a bunch of stuff that helps them.\n\n2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:39.840\n And it's interesting, because they probably\n\n2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:41.740\n wouldn't call themselves Python programmers,\n\n2:09:41.740 --> 2:09:43.820\n but they're all using Python.\n\n2:09:43.820 --> 2:09:46.480\n I would love it if the tools like Photoshop and Premiere\n\n2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:48.760\n and all those kinds of tools that are targeted\n\n2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:52.080\n towards creative people, I guess that's where Excel,\n\n2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:54.220\n Excel is targeted towards a certain kind of audience\n\n2:09:54.220 --> 2:09:56.320\n that works with data, financial people,\n\n2:09:56.320 --> 2:10:00.040\n all that kind of stuff, if there would be easy ways\n\n2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:03.600\n to leverage to use Python for quick scripting tasks.\n\n2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:06.760\n And you know, there's an exciting application\n\n2:10:06.760 --> 2:10:09.760\n of artificial intelligence in this space\n\n2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:13.280\n that I'm hopeful about, looking at open AI codecs\n\n2:10:13.280 --> 2:10:16.940\n with generating programs.\n\n2:10:16.940 --> 2:10:20.800\n So almost helping people bridge the gap\n\n2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:25.800\n from kind of visual interface to generating programs,\n\n2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:28.980\n to something formal, and then they can modify it and so on,\n\n2:10:28.980 --> 2:10:32.360\n but kind of without having to read the manual,\n\n2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:34.880\n without having to do a Google search and stack overflow,\n\n2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:36.760\n which is essentially what a neural network does\n\n2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:39.040\n when it's doing code generation,\n\n2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:42.840\n is actually generating code and allowing a human\n\n2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:44.760\n to communicate with multiple programs,\n\n2:10:44.760 --> 2:10:46.540\n and then maybe even programs to communicate\n\n2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:48.420\n with each other via Python.\n\n2:10:48.420 --> 2:10:51.220\n So that to me is a really exciting possibility,\n\n2:10:51.220 --> 2:10:55.960\n because I think there's a friction to kind of,\n\n2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:58.920\n like how do I learn how to use Python in my life?\n\n2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:03.000\n There's oftentimes you kind of start a class,\n\n2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.080\n you start learning about types, I don't know, functions.\n\n2:11:07.080 --> 2:11:09.600\n Like this is, you know, Python is the first language\n\n2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:11.920\n with which you start to learn to program.\n\n2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:16.680\n But I feel like that's going to take a long time\n\n2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:18.560\n for you to understand why it's useful.\n\n2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:20.300\n You almost want to start with a script.\n\n2:11:20.300 --> 2:11:22.000\n Well, you do, in fact.\n\n2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.840\n I think starting with the theory behind programming languages\n\n2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:26.100\n and types and all that, I mean,\n\n2:11:26.100 --> 2:11:30.000\n types are there to make the compiler writer's jobs easier.\n\n2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.760\n Types are not, I mean, heck, do you have an ontology\n\n2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:34.320\n of types or just the objects on this table?\n\n2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:35.560\n No.\n\n2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:39.160\n So types are there because compiler writers are human\n\n2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:40.840\n and they're limited in what they can do.\n\n2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:45.100\n But I think that the beauty of scripting,\n\n2:11:45.100 --> 2:11:47.560\n like there's a Python book that's called\n\n2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:49.200\n \"'Automate the Boring Stuff,'\n\n2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:51.120\n which is exactly the right mentality.\n\n2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:55.480\n I grew up with computers in a time when I could,\n\n2:11:56.720 --> 2:11:58.840\n when Steve Jobs was still pitching these things\n\n2:11:58.840 --> 2:11:59.880\n as bicycles for the mind.\n\n2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.300\n They were supposed to not be just media consumption devices,\n\n2:12:03.300 --> 2:12:05.920\n but they were actually, you could write some code.\n\n2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:07.280\n You could write basic, you could write some stuff\n\n2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:09.000\n to do some things.\n\n2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:12.160\n And that feeling of a computer as a thing\n\n2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:14.240\n that we can use to extend ourselves\n\n2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:17.780\n has all but evaporated for a lot of people.\n\n2:12:17.780 --> 2:12:19.520\n So you see a little bit in parts\n\n2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:21.560\n in the current, the generation of youth\n\n2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:23.560\n around Minecraft or Roblox, right?\n\n2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:25.120\n And I think Python, circuit Python,\n\n2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:28.800\n these things could be a renaissance of that,\n\n2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:32.660\n of people actually shaping and using their computers\n\n2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:35.500\n as computers, as an extension of their minds\n\n2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:37.880\n and their curiosity, their creativity.\n\n2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:41.560\n So you talk about scripting the Adobe Suite with Python\n\n2:12:41.560 --> 2:12:42.920\n in the 3D graphics world.\n\n2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:46.320\n Python is a scripting language\n\n2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:48.760\n that some of these 3D graphics suites use.\n\n2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:49.600\n And I think that's great.\n\n2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:51.280\n We should better support those kinds of things.\n\n2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:54.200\n But ultimately the idea that I should be able\n\n2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:56.280\n to have power over my computing environment.\n\n2:12:56.280 --> 2:12:59.640\n If I want these things to happen repeatedly all the time,\n\n2:12:59.640 --> 2:13:02.640\n I should be able to say that somehow to the computer, right?\n\n2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:06.520\n Now, whether the operating systems get there faster\n\n2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:09.560\n by having some Siri backed with open AI with whatever.\n\n2:13:09.560 --> 2:13:10.860\n So you can just say, Siri, make this do this\n\n2:13:10.860 --> 2:13:12.640\n and this and every other Friday, right?\n\n2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:14.240\n We probably will get there somewhere.\n\n2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:15.880\n And Apple's always had these ideas.\n\n2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:19.160\n There's the Apple script in the menu that no one ever uses,\n\n2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:21.640\n but you can do these kinds of things.\n\n2:13:21.640 --> 2:13:23.700\n But when you start doing that kind of scripting,\n\n2:13:23.700 --> 2:13:25.920\n the challenge isn't learning the type system\n\n2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:27.160\n or even the syntax of the language.\n\n2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:29.240\n The challenge is all of the dictionaries\n\n2:13:29.240 --> 2:13:31.160\n and all the objects of all their properties\n\n2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:32.840\n and attributes and parameters.\n\n2:13:32.840 --> 2:13:35.420\n Like who's got time to learn all that stuff, right?\n\n2:13:35.420 --> 2:13:38.840\n So that's when then programming by prototype\n\n2:13:38.840 --> 2:13:40.960\n or by example becomes the right way\n\n2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:43.780\n to get the user to express their desire.\n\n2:13:43.780 --> 2:13:45.200\n So there's a lot of these different ways\n\n2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:46.060\n that we can approach programming.\n\n2:13:46.060 --> 2:13:48.280\n But I do think when, as you were talking\n\n2:13:48.280 --> 2:13:49.800\n about the Adobe scripting thing,\n\n2:13:49.800 --> 2:13:51.340\n I was thinking about, you know,\n\n2:13:51.340 --> 2:13:53.780\n when we do use something like NumPy,\n\n2:13:53.780 --> 2:13:55.760\n when we use things in the Python data\n\n2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:00.160\n and scientific, let's say, expression system,\n\n2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:01.360\n there's a reason we use that,\n\n2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:04.400\n which is that it gives us mathematical precision.\n\n2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:06.800\n It gives us actually quite a lot of precision\n\n2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:09.960\n over precisely what we mean about this data set,\n\n2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:11.800\n that data set, and it's the fact\n\n2:14:11.800 --> 2:14:13.680\n that we can have that precision\n\n2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:18.680\n that lets Python be powerful over as a duct tape for data.\n\n2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:21.240\n You know, you give me a TSV or a CSV,\n\n2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:25.120\n and if you give me some massively expensive vendor tool\n\n2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:26.460\n for data transformation,\n\n2:14:26.460 --> 2:14:28.280\n I don't know I'm gonna be able to solve your problem.\n\n2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:30.600\n But if you give me a Python prompt,\n\n2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:32.500\n you can throw whatever data you want at me.\n\n2:14:32.500 --> 2:14:34.400\n I will be able to mash it into shape.\n\n2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:38.360\n So that ability to take it as sort of this like,\n\n2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:40.320\n you know, machete out into the data jungle\n\n2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:41.600\n is really powerful.\n\n2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:44.300\n And I think that's why at some level,\n\n2:14:44.300 --> 2:14:47.760\n we're not gonna get away from some of these expressions\n\n2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:51.660\n and APIs and libraries in Python for data transformation.\n\n2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:57.280\n You've been at the center of the Python community\n\n2:14:57.280 --> 2:14:58.400\n for many years.\n\n2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:03.400\n If you could change one thing about the community\n\n2:15:03.640 --> 2:15:05.540\n to help it grow, to help it improve,\n\n2:15:05.540 --> 2:15:09.440\n to help it flourish and prosper, what would it be?\n\n2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:11.720\n I mean, you know, it doesn't have to be one thing,\n\n2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:13.880\n but what kind of comes to mind?\n\n2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:15.360\n What are the challenges?\n\n2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:16.840\n Humility is one of the values that we have\n\n2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:17.940\n at Anaconda at the company,\n\n2:15:17.940 --> 2:15:21.320\n but it's also one of the values in the community.\n\n2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:24.480\n That it's been breached a little bit in the last few years,\n\n2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:27.360\n but in general, people are quite decent\n\n2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:29.320\n and reasonable and nice.\n\n2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:32.620\n And that humility prevents them from seeing\n\n2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:36.880\n the greatness that they could have.\n\n2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:40.800\n I don't know how many people in the core Python community\n\n2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:45.800\n really understand that they stand perched at the edge\n\n2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:50.160\n of an opportunity to transform how people use computers.\n\n2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:52.760\n And actually, PyCon, I think it's the last physical PyCon\n\n2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:56.680\n I went to, Russell Keith McGee gave a great keynote\n\n2:15:56.680 --> 2:16:00.560\n about very much along the lines of the challenges I have,\n\n2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:04.320\n which is Python, for a language that doesn't actually,\n\n2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:05.720\n that can't put an interface up,\n\n2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:09.360\n put an interface up on the most popular computing devices,\n\n2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:11.800\n it's done really well as a language, hasn't it?\n\n2:16:11.800 --> 2:16:13.720\n You can't write a web front end with Python, really.\n\n2:16:13.720 --> 2:16:15.080\n I mean, everyone uses JavaScript.\n\n2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:17.040\n You certainly can't write native apps.\n\n2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:20.580\n So for a language that you can't actually write apps\n\n2:16:20.580 --> 2:16:22.720\n in any of those front end runtime environments,\n\n2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:24.360\n Python's done exceedingly well.\n\n2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.760\n And so that wasn't to pat ourselves on the back.\n\n2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.580\n That was to challenge ourselves as a community to say,\n\n2:16:30.580 --> 2:16:32.520\n we, through our current volunteer dynamic,\n\n2:16:32.520 --> 2:16:34.460\n have gotten to this point.\n\n2:16:34.460 --> 2:16:36.720\n What comes next and how do we seize,\n\n2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:38.620\n you know, we've caught the tiger by the tail.\n\n2:16:38.620 --> 2:16:40.960\n How do we make sure we keep up with it as it goes forward?\n\n2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:42.440\n So that's one of the questions I have\n\n2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:44.240\n about sort of open source communities,\n\n2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:48.500\n is at its best, there's a kind of humility.\n\n2:16:48.500 --> 2:16:52.500\n Is that humility prevent you to have a vision\n\n2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:55.560\n for creating something like very new and powerful?\n\n2:16:55.560 --> 2:16:57.640\n And you've brought us back to consciousness again.\n\n2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:00.700\n The collaboration is a swarm emergent dynamic.\n\n2:17:00.700 --> 2:17:02.640\n Humility lets these people work together\n\n2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:04.840\n without anyone trouncing anyone else.\n\n2:17:04.840 --> 2:17:07.200\n How do they, you know, in consciousness,\n\n2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:08.680\n there's the question of the binding problem.\n\n2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:10.720\n How does a singular, our attention,\n\n2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:13.880\n how does that emerge from billions of neurons?\n\n2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:17.680\n So how can you have a swarm of people emerge a consensus\n\n2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:20.620\n that has a singular vision to say, we will do this.\n\n2:17:20.620 --> 2:17:23.880\n And most importantly, we're not gonna do these things.\n\n2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:28.880\n Emerging a coherent, pointed, focused leadership dynamic\n\n2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:32.060\n from a collaboration, being able to do that kind of,\n\n2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:34.040\n and then dissolve it so people can still do\n\n2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:37.240\n the swarm thing, that's a problem, that's a question.\n\n2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:39.580\n So do you have to have a charismatic leader?\n\n2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:42.640\n For some reason, Linus Torvald comes to mind,\n\n2:17:42.640 --> 2:17:44.640\n but there's people who criticize.\n\n2:17:44.640 --> 2:17:46.640\n He rules with an iron fist, man.\n\n2:17:46.640 --> 2:17:48.520\n But there's still charisma to it.\n\n2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:49.520\n There is charisma, right?\n\n2:17:49.520 --> 2:17:51.760\n There's a charisma to that iron fist.\n\n2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:55.320\n There's, every leader's different, I would say,\n\n2:17:55.320 --> 2:17:56.700\n in their success.\n\n2:17:56.700 --> 2:17:59.480\n So he doesn't, I don't even know if you can say\n\n2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:04.480\n he doesn't have humility, there's such a meritocracy\n\n2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:09.000\n of ideas that like, this is a good idea\n\n2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:10.440\n and this is a bad idea.\n\n2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:11.640\n There's a step function to it.\n\n2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:13.920\n Once you clear a threshold, he's open.\n\n2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:15.680\n Once you clear the bozo threshold,\n\n2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:17.560\n he's open to your ideas, I think, right?\n\n2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:20.280\n But see, the interesting thing is obviously\n\n2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:23.440\n that will not stand in an open source community\n\n2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:25.920\n if that threshold that is defined\n\n2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:30.320\n by that one particular person is not actually that good.\n\n2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:33.720\n So you actually have to be really excellent at what you do.\n\n2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:37.120\n So he's very good at what he does.\n\n2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:39.040\n And so there's some aspect of leadership\n\n2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:42.920\n where you can get thrown out, people can just leave.\n\n2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:45.960\n That's how it works with open source, the fork.\n\n2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:49.940\n But at the same time, you want to sometimes be a leader\n\n2:18:49.940 --> 2:18:52.440\n like with a strong opinion, because people,\n\n2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:54.440\n I mean, there's some kind of balance here\n\n2:18:54.440 --> 2:18:57.400\n for this like hive mind to get like behind.\n\n2:18:57.400 --> 2:18:58.520\n Leadership is a big topic.\n\n2:18:58.520 --> 2:18:59.880\n And I didn't, I'm not one of these guys\n\n2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:01.120\n that went to MBA school and said,\n\n2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:03.560\n I'm gonna be an entrepreneur and I'm gonna be a leader.\n\n2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:05.280\n And I'm gonna read all these Harvard Business Review\n\n2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:07.760\n articles on leadership and all this other stuff.\n\n2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:10.700\n Like I was a physicist turned into a software nerd\n\n2:19:10.700 --> 2:19:13.600\n who then really like nerded out on Python.\n\n2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:14.840\n And now I am entrepreneurial, right?\n\n2:19:14.840 --> 2:19:16.280\n I saw a business opportunity around the use\n\n2:19:16.280 --> 2:19:17.120\n of Python for data.\n\n2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:20.720\n But for me, what has been interesting over this journey\n\n2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:25.320\n with the last 10 years is how much I started really\n\n2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:28.520\n enjoying the understanding, thinking deeper\n\n2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:31.320\n about organizational dynamics and leadership.\n\n2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:35.280\n And leadership does come down to a few core things.\n\n2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:40.000\n Number one, a leader has to create belief\n\n2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.300\n or at least has to dispel disbelief.\n\n2:19:44.060 --> 2:19:46.480\n Leadership also, you have to have vision,\n\n2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:49.360\n loyalty and experience.\n\n2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:52.640\n So can you say belief in a singular vision?\n\n2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:53.680\n Like what does belief mean?\n\n2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:55.240\n Yeah, belief means a few things.\n\n2:19:55.240 --> 2:19:57.000\n Belief means here's what we need to do\n\n2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:00.040\n and this is a valid thing to do and we can do it.\n\n2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:06.040\n That you have to be able to drive that belief.\n\n2:20:06.040 --> 2:20:08.800\n And every step of leadership along the way\n\n2:20:08.800 --> 2:20:12.680\n has to help you amplify that belief to more people.\n\n2:20:12.680 --> 2:20:15.920\n I mean, I think at a fundamental level, that's what it is.\n\n2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:17.120\n You have to have a vision.\n\n2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:20.920\n You have to be able to show people that,\n\n2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:23.640\n or you have to convince people to believe in the vision\n\n2:20:23.640 --> 2:20:25.240\n and to get behind you.\n\n2:20:25.240 --> 2:20:26.480\n And that's where the loyalty part comes in\n\n2:20:26.480 --> 2:20:28.200\n and the experience part comes in.\n\n2:20:28.200 --> 2:20:30.200\n There's all different flavors of leadership.\n\n2:20:30.200 --> 2:20:34.320\n So if we talk about Linus, we could talk about Elon Musk\n\n2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:38.440\n and Steve Jobs, there's Sunder Prachai.\n\n2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:40.760\n There's people that kind of put themselves at the center\n\n2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:42.560\n and are strongly opinionated.\n\n2:20:42.560 --> 2:20:45.160\n And some people are more like consensus builders.\n\n2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:47.720\n What works well for open source?\n\n2:20:47.720 --> 2:20:49.680\n What works well in the space of programmers?\n\n2:20:49.680 --> 2:20:53.240\n So you've been a programmer, you've led many programmers\n\n2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:55.600\n that are now sort of at the center of this ecosystem.\n\n2:20:55.600 --> 2:20:58.960\n What works well in the programming world would you say?\n\n2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:01.120\n It really depends on the people.\n\n2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:02.600\n What style of leadership is best?\n\n2:21:02.600 --> 2:21:04.160\n And it depends on the programming community.\n\n2:21:04.160 --> 2:21:06.320\n I think for the Python community,\n\n2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:08.560\n servant leadership is one of the values.\n\n2:21:08.560 --> 2:21:11.720\n At the end of the day, the leader has to also be\n\n2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:14.720\n the high priest of values, right?\n\n2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:19.160\n So any collection of people has values of their living.\n\n2:21:19.160 --> 2:21:23.680\n And if you want to maintain certain values\n\n2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:26.280\n and those values help you as an organization\n\n2:21:26.280 --> 2:21:27.520\n become more powerful,\n\n2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:30.560\n then the leader has to live those values unequivocally\n\n2:21:30.560 --> 2:21:33.600\n and has to hold the values.\n\n2:21:33.600 --> 2:21:36.680\n So in our case, in this collaborative community\n\n2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:41.400\n around Python, I think that the humility\n\n2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:42.920\n is one of those values.\n\n2:21:42.920 --> 2:21:45.320\n Servant leadership, you actually have to kind of do the stuff.\n\n2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:47.760\n You have to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.\n\n2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:52.040\n I don't feel like the Python community really demands\n\n2:21:52.040 --> 2:21:53.800\n that much from a vision standpoint.\n\n2:21:53.800 --> 2:21:54.760\n And they should.\n\n2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:56.680\n And I think they should.\n\n2:21:56.680 --> 2:22:00.840\n This is the interesting thing is like so many people\n\n2:22:00.840 --> 2:22:04.720\n use Python, from where comes the vision?\n\n2:22:04.720 --> 2:22:07.640\n You know, like you have a Elon Musk type character\n\n2:22:07.640 --> 2:22:12.160\n who makes bold statements about the vision\n\n2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:14.640\n for particular companies he's involved with.\n\n2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:18.680\n And it's like, I think a lot of people that work\n\n2:22:18.680 --> 2:22:22.560\n at those companies kind of can only last\n\n2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:24.680\n if they believe that vision.\n\n2:22:24.680 --> 2:22:26.240\n And some of it is super bold.\n\n2:22:26.240 --> 2:22:28.600\n So my question is, and by the way,\n\n2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:30.280\n those companies often use Python.\n\n2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:33.760\n How do you establish a vision?\n\n2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:37.360\n Like get to 100 million users, right?\n\n2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:42.280\n Get to where, you know, the Python is at the center\n\n2:22:42.280 --> 2:22:46.760\n of the machine learning and was it data science,\n\n2:22:46.760 --> 2:22:48.440\n machine learning, deep learning,\n\n2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:51.720\n artificial intelligence revolution, right?\n\n2:22:51.720 --> 2:22:54.920\n Like in many ways, perhaps the Python community\n\n2:22:54.920 --> 2:22:55.840\n is not thinking of it that way,\n\n2:22:55.840 --> 2:22:58.160\n but it's leading the way on this.\n\n2:22:58.160 --> 2:23:01.240\n Like the tooling is like essential.\n\n2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:03.320\n Right, well, you know, for a while,\n\n2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:05.840\n PyCon people in the scientific Python\n\n2:23:05.840 --> 2:23:09.320\n and the PyData community, they would submit talks.\n\n2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:12.160\n Those are early 2010s, mid 2010s.\n\n2:23:12.160 --> 2:23:14.080\n They would submit talks for PyCon\n\n2:23:14.080 --> 2:23:15.760\n and the talks would all be rejected\n\n2:23:15.760 --> 2:23:18.680\n because there was the separate sort of PyData conferences.\n\n2:23:18.680 --> 2:23:21.200\n And like, well, these probably belong more to PyData.\n\n2:23:21.200 --> 2:23:23.520\n And instead there'd be yet another talk about, you know,\n\n2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:26.400\n threads and, you know, whatever, some web framework.\n\n2:23:26.400 --> 2:23:29.880\n And it's like, that was an interesting dynamic to see\n\n2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:32.680\n that there was, I mean, at the time it was a little annoying\n\n2:23:32.680 --> 2:23:34.280\n because we wanted to try to get more users\n\n2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:35.760\n and get more people talking about these things.\n\n2:23:35.760 --> 2:23:37.320\n And PyCon is a huge venue, right?\n\n2:23:37.320 --> 2:23:40.240\n It's thousands of Python programmers.\n\n2:23:40.240 --> 2:23:42.200\n But then also came to appreciate that, you know,\n\n2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:45.400\n parallel, having an ecosystem that allows parallel\n\n2:23:45.400 --> 2:23:47.400\n innovation is not bad, right?\n\n2:23:47.400 --> 2:23:49.040\n There are people doing embedded Python stuff.\n\n2:23:49.040 --> 2:23:50.640\n There's people doing web programming,\n\n2:23:50.640 --> 2:23:53.280\n people doing scripting, there's cyber uses of Python.\n\n2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:55.120\n I think the, ultimately at some point,\n\n2:23:55.120 --> 2:23:58.040\n if your slide mold covers so much stuff,\n\n2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:00.160\n you have to respect that different things are growing\n\n2:24:00.160 --> 2:24:02.320\n in different areas and different niches.\n\n2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:04.160\n Now, at some point that has to come together\n\n2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:07.560\n and the central body has to provide resources.\n\n2:24:07.560 --> 2:24:09.160\n The principle here is subsidiarity.\n\n2:24:09.160 --> 2:24:11.760\n Give resources to the various groups\n\n2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:15.040\n to then allocate as they see fit in their niches.\n\n2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:16.360\n That would be a really helpful dynamic.\n\n2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:17.520\n But again, it's a volunteer community.\n\n2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:20.200\n It's not like they had that many resources to start with.\n\n2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:23.920\n What was or is your favorite programming setup?\n\n2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:25.720\n What operating system, what keyboard,\n\n2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:29.080\n how many screens are you listening to?\n\n2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:32.960\n What time of day are you drinking coffee, tea?\n\n2:24:32.960 --> 2:24:36.280\n Tea, sometimes coffee, depending on how well I slept.\n\n2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:37.120\n I used to have.\n\n2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:38.120\n How much sleep do you get?\n\n2:24:38.120 --> 2:24:39.680\n Are you a night owl?\n\n2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:41.520\n I remember somebody asked you somewhere,\n\n2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:43.360\n a question about work life balance.\n\n2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:47.720\n Not just work life balance, but like a family,\n\n2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:52.080\n you lead a company and your answer was basically like,\n\n2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:54.240\n I still haven't figured it out.\n\n2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:56.320\n Yeah, I think I've gotten to a little bit better balance.\n\n2:24:56.320 --> 2:24:58.880\n I have a really great leadership team now supporting me\n\n2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:01.680\n and so that takes a lot of the day to day stuff\n\n2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:04.400\n off my plate and my kids are getting a little older.\n\n2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:05.240\n So that helps.\n\n2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:07.520\n So, and of course I have a wonderful wife\n\n2:25:07.520 --> 2:25:09.240\n who takes care of a lot of the things\n\n2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:11.680\n that I'm not able to take care of and she's great.\n\n2:25:11.680 --> 2:25:13.760\n I try to get to sleep earlier now\n\n2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:15.160\n because I have to get up every morning at six\n\n2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:17.000\n to take my kid down to the bus stop.\n\n2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:19.280\n So there's a hard thing.\n\n2:25:19.280 --> 2:25:21.120\n For a while I was doing polyphasic sleep,\n\n2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:22.040\n which is really interesting.\n\n2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:24.640\n Like I go to bed at nine, wake up at like 2 a.m.,\n\n2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:27.320\n work till five, sleep three hours, wake up at eight.\n\n2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:29.360\n Like that was actually, it was interesting.\n\n2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:30.200\n It wasn't too bad.\n\n2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:31.160\n How did it feel?\n\n2:25:31.160 --> 2:25:32.000\n It was good.\n\n2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.960\n I didn't keep it up for years, but once I have travel,\n\n2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:37.360\n then it just, everything goes out the window, right?\n\n2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:39.120\n Because then you're like time zones and all these things.\n\n2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:42.440\n Socially was it, except like were you able to live\n\n2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:43.480\n outside of how you felt?\n\n2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:45.720\n Were you able to live normal society?\n\n2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:47.360\n Oh yeah, because like on the nights\n\n2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:48.920\n that I wasn't out hanging out with people or whatever,\n\n2:25:48.920 --> 2:25:50.680\n going to bed at nine, no one cares.\n\n2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:52.720\n I wake up at two, I'm still responding to their slacks,\n\n2:25:52.720 --> 2:25:56.880\n emails, whatever, and you know, shitposting on Twitter\n\n2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:59.200\n or whatever at two in the morning is great, right?\n\n2:25:59.200 --> 2:26:02.440\n And then you go to bed for a few hours and you wake up,\n\n2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:04.520\n it's like you had an extra day in the middle.\n\n2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:06.320\n And I'd read somewhere that humans naturally\n\n2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:09.160\n have biphasic sleep or something, I don't know.\n\n2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:11.160\n I read basically everything somewhere.\n\n2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:13.400\n So every option of everything.\n\n2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:14.520\n Every option of everything.\n\n2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:16.840\n I will say that that worked out for me for a while,\n\n2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:18.480\n although I don't do it anymore.\n\n2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:19.400\n In terms of programming setup,\n\n2:26:19.400 --> 2:26:24.400\n I had a 27 inch high DPI setup that I really liked,\n\n2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:26.200\n but then I moved to a curved monitor\n\n2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:28.840\n just because when I moved to the new house,\n\n2:26:28.840 --> 2:26:32.440\n I want to have a bit more screen for Zoom plus communications\n\n2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:33.280\n plus various kinds of things.\n\n2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:35.800\n So it's like one large monitor.\n\n2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:37.040\n One large curved monitor.\n\n2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:39.720\n What operating system?\n\n2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:40.640\n Mac.\n\n2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:41.640\n Okay. Yeah.\n\n2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:43.920\n Is that what happens when you become important,\n\n2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:46.680\n is you stop using Linux and Windows?\n\n2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:48.520\n No, I actually have a Windows box as well\n\n2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:53.520\n on the next table over, but I have three desks, right?\n\n2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:57.200\n So the main one is the standing desk so that I can,\n\n2:26:57.200 --> 2:26:59.320\n whatever, when I'm like, I have a teleprompter set up\n\n2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:00.160\n and everything else.\n\n2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:05.160\n And then I've got my iMac and then eGPU and then Windows PC.\n\n2:27:06.480 --> 2:27:10.680\n The reason I moved to Mac was it's got a Linux prompt\n\n2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:13.000\n or no, sorry, it's got a, it's got a Unix prompt\n\n2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:18.000\n so I can do all my stuff, but then I don't have to worry.\n\n2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:19.640\n Like when I'm presenting for clients\n\n2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:21.800\n or investors or whatever, like it,\n\n2:27:21.800 --> 2:27:25.120\n I don't have to worry about any like ACPI related\n\n2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:27.160\n fsic things in the middle of a presentation,\n\n2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:28.000\n like none of that.\n\n2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:29.800\n It just, it will always wake from sleep\n\n2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:32.320\n and it won't kernel panic on me.\n\n2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:34.200\n And this is not a dig against Linux,\n\n2:27:34.200 --> 2:27:38.440\n except that I just, I feel really bad.\n\n2:27:38.440 --> 2:27:40.180\n I feel like a traitor to my community saying this, right?\n\n2:27:40.180 --> 2:27:43.240\n But in 2012, I was just like, okay, start my own company.\n\n2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:44.060\n What do I get?\n\n2:27:44.060 --> 2:27:47.520\n And Linux laptops were just not quite there.\n\n2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:48.840\n And so I've just stuck with Macs.\n\n2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:51.360\n Can I just defend something that nobody respectable\n\n2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:55.800\n seems to do, which is, so I do a boot on Linux windows,\n\n2:27:55.800 --> 2:27:59.560\n but in windows, I have a windows subsystems\n\n2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:02.920\n for Linux or whatever, WSL.\n\n2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:06.480\n And I find myself being able to handle everything I need\n\n2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:08.360\n and almost everything I need in Linux\n\n2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:11.280\n for basic sort of tasks, scripting tasks within WSL\n\n2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:12.960\n and it creates a really nice environment.\n\n2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:15.400\n So I've been, but like whenever I hang out with like,\n\n2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:17.000\n especially important people,\n\n2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:20.720\n like they're all on iPhone and a Mac\n\n2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:23.360\n and it's like, yeah, like what,\n\n2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:27.840\n there is a messiness to windows and a messiness to Linux\n\n2:28:27.840 --> 2:28:31.880\n that makes me feel like you're still in it.\n\n2:28:31.880 --> 2:28:34.700\n Well, the Linux stuff, windows subsystem for Linux\n\n2:28:34.700 --> 2:28:37.840\n is very tempting, but there's still the windows\n\n2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:40.280\n on the outside where I don't know where,\n\n2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:44.160\n and I've been, okay, I've used DOS since version 1.11\n\n2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:45.560\n or 1.21 or something.\n\n2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:48.360\n So I've been a long time Microsoft user.\n\n2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:52.120\n And I will say that like, it's really hard\n\n2:28:52.120 --> 2:28:53.440\n for me to know where anything is,\n\n2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:55.040\n how to get to the details behind something\n\n2:28:55.040 --> 2:28:57.600\n when something screws up as an invariably does\n\n2:28:57.600 --> 2:28:59.920\n and just things like changing group permissions\n\n2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:01.400\n on some shared folders and stuff,\n\n2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:03.600\n just everything seems a little bit more awkward,\n\n2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:05.240\n more clicks than it needs to be.\n\n2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:07.800\n Not to say that there aren't weird things\n\n2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:09.880\n like hidden attributes and all this other happy stuff\n\n2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:14.060\n on Mac, but for the most part,\n\n2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:15.400\n and well, actually, especially now\n\n2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:16.880\n with the new hardware coming out on Mac,\n\n2:29:16.880 --> 2:29:19.020\n it'll be very interesting with the new M1.\n\n2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:21.640\n There were some dark years in the last few years\n\n2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:24.000\n when I was like, I think maybe I have to move off of Mac\n\n2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:27.400\n as a platform, but this, I mean,\n\n2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:29.080\n like my keyboard was just not working.\n\n2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:31.200\n Like literally my keyboard just wasn't working, right?\n\n2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:33.540\n I had this touch bar, didn't have a physical escape button\n\n2:29:33.540 --> 2:29:35.200\n like I needed to because I used Vim,\n\n2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:37.440\n and now I think we're back, so.\n\n2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:40.340\n So you use Vim and you have a, what kind of keyboard?\n\n2:29:40.340 --> 2:29:44.080\n So I use a RealForce 87U, it's a mechanical,\n\n2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:45.240\n it's a Topre keyswitch.\n\n2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:48.520\n Like it's a weird shape, there's a normal shape, okay.\n\n2:29:48.520 --> 2:29:51.480\n Well, no, because I say that because I use a Kinesis,\n\n2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:55.000\n and you said some dark, you said you had dark moments.\n\n2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:57.440\n I recently had a dark moment,\n\n2:29:57.440 --> 2:29:58.780\n I was like, what am I doing with my life?\n\n2:29:58.780 --> 2:30:03.020\n So I remember sort of flying in a very kind of tight space,\n\n2:30:03.020 --> 2:30:06.600\n and as I'm working, this is what I do on an airplane.\n\n2:30:06.600 --> 2:30:09.600\n I pull out a laptop, and on top of the laptop,\n\n2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:11.080\n I'll put a Kinesis keyboard.\n\n2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:12.040\n That's hardcore, man.\n\n2:30:12.040 --> 2:30:13.800\n I was thinking, is this who I am?\n\n2:30:13.800 --> 2:30:15.080\n Is this what I'm becoming?\n\n2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:16.200\n Will I be this person?\n\n2:30:16.200 --> 2:30:18.560\n Because I'm on Emacs with this Kinesis keyboard,\n\n2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:21.960\n sitting like with everybody around.\n\n2:30:21.960 --> 2:30:23.620\n Emacs on Windows.\n\n2:30:23.620 --> 2:30:25.600\n On WSL, yeah.\n\n2:30:25.600 --> 2:30:27.360\n Yeah, Emacs on Linux on Windows.\n\n2:30:27.360 --> 2:30:28.720\n Yeah, on Windows.\n\n2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:32.200\n And like everybody around me is using their iPhone\n\n2:30:32.200 --> 2:30:33.140\n to look at TikTok.\n\n2:30:33.140 --> 2:30:36.560\n So I'm like in this land, and I thought, you know what?\n\n2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:40.880\n Maybe I need to become an adult and put the 90s behind me,\n\n2:30:40.880 --> 2:30:43.120\n and use like a normal keyboard.\n\n2:30:43.120 --> 2:30:45.040\n And then I did some soul searching,\n\n2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:46.760\n and I decided like this is who I am.\n\n2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:48.520\n This is me like coming out of the closet\n\n2:30:48.520 --> 2:30:50.760\n to saying I'm Kinesis keyboard all the way.\n\n2:30:50.760 --> 2:30:52.840\n I'm going to use Emacs.\n\n2:30:52.840 --> 2:30:55.160\n You know who else is a Kinesis fan?\n\n2:30:55.160 --> 2:30:56.720\n Wes McKinney, the creator of Pandas.\n\n2:30:56.720 --> 2:30:57.560\n Oh.\n\n2:30:57.560 --> 2:31:00.000\n He banged out Pandas on a Kinesis keyboard, I believe.\n\n2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:01.920\n I don't know if he's still using one, maybe,\n\n2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:04.200\n but certainly 10 years ago, like he was.\n\n2:31:04.200 --> 2:31:05.320\n If anyone's out there,\n\n2:31:05.320 --> 2:31:07.520\n maybe we need to have a Kinesis support group.\n\n2:31:07.520 --> 2:31:08.360\n Please reach out.\n\n2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:09.440\n Isn't there already one?\n\n2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:10.280\n Is there one?\n\n2:31:10.280 --> 2:31:11.100\n I don't know.\n\n2:31:11.100 --> 2:31:12.100\n There's gotta be an RSC channel, man.\n\n2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:16.880\n Oh no, and you access it through Emacs.\n\n2:31:16.880 --> 2:31:18.040\n Okay.\n\n2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:19.600\n Do you still program these days?\n\n2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:20.540\n I do a little bit.\n\n2:31:21.440 --> 2:31:25.900\n Honestly, the last thing I did was I had written,\n\n2:31:25.900 --> 2:31:28.540\n I was working with my son to script some Minecraft stuff.\n\n2:31:28.540 --> 2:31:29.560\n So I was doing a little bit of that.\n\n2:31:29.560 --> 2:31:33.100\n That was the last, literally the last code I wrote.\n\n2:31:33.100 --> 2:31:33.940\n Oh, you know what?\n\n2:31:33.940 --> 2:31:36.600\n Also, I wrote some code to do some cap table evaluation,\n\n2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:38.240\n waterfall modeling kind of stuff.\n\n2:31:39.260 --> 2:31:41.320\n What advice would you give to a young person,\n\n2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:44.200\n you said your son, today, in high school,\n\n2:31:44.200 --> 2:31:47.400\n maybe even college, about career, about life?\n\n2:31:48.580 --> 2:31:51.120\n This may be where I get into trouble a little bit.\n\n2:31:51.120 --> 2:31:53.380\n We are coming to the end.\n\n2:31:53.380 --> 2:31:56.520\n We're rapidly entering a time between worlds.\n\n2:31:56.520 --> 2:31:59.920\n So we have a world now that's starting to really crumble\n\n2:31:59.920 --> 2:32:01.900\n under the weight of aging institutions\n\n2:32:01.900 --> 2:32:04.460\n that no longer even pretend to serve the purposes\n\n2:32:04.460 --> 2:32:05.740\n they were created for.\n\n2:32:05.740 --> 2:32:09.060\n We are creating technologies that are hurtling billions\n\n2:32:09.060 --> 2:32:11.460\n of people headlong into philosophical crises\n\n2:32:11.460 --> 2:32:14.300\n who they don't even know the philosophical operating systems\n\n2:32:14.300 --> 2:32:15.120\n in their firmware.\n\n2:32:15.120 --> 2:32:17.840\n And they're heading into a time when that gets vaporized.\n\n2:32:17.840 --> 2:32:20.100\n So for people in high school,\n\n2:32:20.100 --> 2:32:21.520\n and certainly I tell my son this as well,\n\n2:32:21.520 --> 2:32:24.920\n he's in middle school, people in college,\n\n2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:29.740\n you are going to have to find your own way.\n\n2:32:29.740 --> 2:32:31.700\n You're going to have to have a pioneer spirit,\n\n2:32:31.700 --> 2:32:34.080\n even if you live in the middle\n\n2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:36.360\n of the most dense urban environment.\n\n2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:38.800\n All of human reality around you\n\n2:32:40.120 --> 2:32:44.440\n is the result of the last few generations of humans\n\n2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:47.360\n agreeing to play certain kinds of games.\n\n2:32:47.360 --> 2:32:51.880\n A lot of those games no longer operate\n\n2:32:51.880 --> 2:32:53.600\n according to the rules they used to.\n\n2:32:55.760 --> 2:32:58.040\n Collapse is nonlinear, but it will be managed.\n\n2:32:58.040 --> 2:33:02.200\n And so if you are in a particular social caste\n\n2:33:02.200 --> 2:33:03.880\n or economic caste,\n\n2:33:03.880 --> 2:33:08.880\n and I think it's not kosher to say that about America,\n\n2:33:10.200 --> 2:33:14.140\n but America is a very stratified and classist society.\n\n2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:17.080\n There's some mobility, but it's really quite classist.\n\n2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:20.800\n And in America, unless you're in the upper middle class,\n\n2:33:20.800 --> 2:33:23.520\n you are headed into very choppy waters.\n\n2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:26.260\n So it is really, really good to think\n\n2:33:26.260 --> 2:33:29.240\n and understand the fundamentals of what you need\n\n2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:32.760\n to build a meaningful life for you, your loved ones,\n\n2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:33.860\n with your family.\n\n2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:38.000\n And almost all of the technology being created\n\n2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:41.760\n that's consumer facing is designed to own people,\n\n2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:46.760\n to take the four stack of people, to delaminate them,\n\n2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:50.360\n and to own certain portions of that stack.\n\n2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.280\n And so if you want to be an integral human being,\n\n2:33:52.280 --> 2:33:54.400\n if you want to have your agency\n\n2:33:54.400 --> 2:33:57.640\n and you want to find your own way in the world,\n\n2:33:57.640 --> 2:34:00.580\n when you're young would be a great time to spend time\n\n2:34:00.580 --> 2:34:02.960\n looking at some of the classics\n\n2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:05.880\n around what it means to live a good life,\n\n2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:08.080\n what it means to build connection with people.\n\n2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:12.120\n And so much of the status game, so much of the stuff,\n\n2:34:13.060 --> 2:34:14.860\n one of the things that I sort of talk about\n\n2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:18.640\n as we create more and more technology,\n\n2:34:18.640 --> 2:34:19.840\n there's a gradient of technology,\n\n2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:20.820\n and a gradient of technology\n\n2:34:20.820 --> 2:34:22.640\n always leads to a gradient of power.\n\n2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:25.200\n And this is Jacques Leleu's point to some extent as well.\n\n2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:27.280\n That gradient of power is not going to go away.\n\n2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:29.900\n The technologies are going so fast\n\n2:34:29.900 --> 2:34:32.040\n that even people like me who helped create\n\n2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:33.640\n some of the stuff, I'm being left behind.\n\n2:34:33.640 --> 2:34:34.680\n Some of the cutting edge research,\n\n2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:36.800\n I don't know what's going on against today.\n\n2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:38.660\n You know, I go read some proceedings.\n\n2:34:38.660 --> 2:34:42.620\n So as the world gets more and more technological,\n\n2:34:42.620 --> 2:34:44.240\n it will create more and more gradients\n\n2:34:44.240 --> 2:34:48.400\n where people will seize power, economic fortunes.\n\n2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:51.320\n And the way they make the people who are left behind\n\n2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:54.480\n okay with their lot in life is they create lottery systems.\n\n2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:59.480\n They make you take part in the narrative\n\n2:35:00.020 --> 2:35:04.180\n of your own being trapped in your own economic sort of zone.\n\n2:35:04.180 --> 2:35:07.920\n So avoiding those kinds of things is really important.\n\n2:35:07.920 --> 2:35:10.740\n Knowing when someone is running game on you basically.\n\n2:35:10.740 --> 2:35:12.260\n So these are the things I would tell young people.\n\n2:35:12.260 --> 2:35:14.220\n It's a dark message, but it's realism.\n\n2:35:14.220 --> 2:35:15.860\n I mean, that's what I see.\n\n2:35:15.860 --> 2:35:18.500\n So after you gave some realism, you sit back.\n\n2:35:18.500 --> 2:35:19.760\n You sit back with your son.\n\n2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:21.700\n You're looking out at the sunset.\n\n2:35:21.700 --> 2:35:26.700\n What to him can you give as words of hope and to you\n\n2:35:27.900 --> 2:35:32.120\n from where do you derive hope for the future of our world?\n\n2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:33.620\n So you said at the individual level,\n\n2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:36.460\n you have to have a pioneer mindset\n\n2:35:36.460 --> 2:35:38.100\n to go back to the classics,\n\n2:35:38.100 --> 2:35:41.580\n to understand what is in human nature you can find meaning.\n\n2:35:41.580 --> 2:35:44.500\n But at the societal level, what trajectory,\n\n2:35:44.500 --> 2:35:47.460\n when you look up possible trajectories, what gives you hope?\n\n2:35:47.460 --> 2:35:52.460\n What gives me hope is that we have little tremors now\n\n2:35:52.780 --> 2:35:54.620\n shaking people out of the reverie\n\n2:35:54.620 --> 2:35:57.020\n of the fiction of modernity that they've been living in,\n\n2:35:57.020 --> 2:35:59.500\n kind of a late 20th century style modernity.\n\n2:36:00.540 --> 2:36:02.860\n That's good, I think.\n\n2:36:02.860 --> 2:36:06.400\n Because, and also to your point earlier,\n\n2:36:06.400 --> 2:36:08.180\n people are burning out on some of the social media stuff.\n\n2:36:08.180 --> 2:36:09.300\n They're sort of seeing the ugly side,\n\n2:36:09.300 --> 2:36:11.620\n especially the latest news with Facebook\n\n2:36:11.620 --> 2:36:12.820\n and the whistleblower, right?\n\n2:36:12.820 --> 2:36:15.740\n It's quite clear these things are not\n\n2:36:15.740 --> 2:36:16.740\n all they're cracked up to be.\n\n2:36:16.740 --> 2:36:20.740\n Do you believe, I believe better social media can be built\n\n2:36:20.740 --> 2:36:21.820\n because they are burning out\n\n2:36:21.820 --> 2:36:25.300\n and it'll incentivize other competitors to be built.\n\n2:36:25.300 --> 2:36:26.460\n Do you think that's possible?\n\n2:36:26.460 --> 2:36:29.060\n Well, the thing about it is that\n\n2:36:29.060 --> 2:36:32.100\n when you have extractive return on returns\n\n2:36:33.820 --> 2:36:35.380\n capital coming in and saying,\n\n2:36:35.380 --> 2:36:36.620\n look, you own a network,\n\n2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:39.020\n give me some exponential dynamics out of this network.\n\n2:36:39.020 --> 2:36:39.840\n What are you gonna do?\n\n2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:41.460\n You're gonna just basically put a toll keeper\n\n2:36:41.460 --> 2:36:45.220\n at every single node and every single graph edge,\n\n2:36:45.220 --> 2:36:47.100\n every node, every vertex, every edge.\n\n2:36:48.020 --> 2:36:49.920\n But if you don't have that need for it,\n\n2:36:49.920 --> 2:36:51.220\n if no one's sitting there saying,\n\n2:36:51.220 --> 2:36:53.260\n hey, Wikipedia, monetize every character,\n\n2:36:53.260 --> 2:36:54.980\n every byte, every phrase,\n\n2:36:54.980 --> 2:36:58.340\n then generative human dynamics will naturally sort of arise,\n\n2:36:58.340 --> 2:37:01.140\n assuming we respect a few principles\n\n2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:03.020\n around online communications.\n\n2:37:03.020 --> 2:37:05.800\n So the greatest and biggest social network in the world\n\n2:37:05.800 --> 2:37:08.780\n is still like email, SMS, right?\n\n2:37:08.780 --> 2:37:10.580\n So we're fine there.\n\n2:37:10.580 --> 2:37:13.220\n The issue with the social media, as we call it now,\n\n2:37:13.220 --> 2:37:16.620\n is they're actually just new amplification systems, right?\n\n2:37:16.620 --> 2:37:18.660\n Now it's benefited certain people like yourself\n\n2:37:18.660 --> 2:37:23.140\n who have interesting content to be amplified.\n\n2:37:23.140 --> 2:37:25.180\n So it's created a creator economy, and that's cool.\n\n2:37:25.180 --> 2:37:26.820\n There's a lot of great content out there.\n\n2:37:26.820 --> 2:37:29.300\n But giving everyone a shot at the fame lottery,\n\n2:37:29.300 --> 2:37:31.500\n saying, hey, you could also have your,\n\n2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:33.940\n if you wiggle your butt the right way on TikTok,\n\n2:37:33.940 --> 2:37:36.100\n you can have your 15 seconds of micro fame.\n\n2:37:36.100 --> 2:37:38.180\n That's not healthy for society at large.\n\n2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:41.700\n So I think if we can create tools that help people\n\n2:37:41.700 --> 2:37:45.180\n be conscientious about their attention,\n\n2:37:45.180 --> 2:37:46.700\n spend time looking at the past,\n\n2:37:46.700 --> 2:37:49.600\n and really retrieving memory and calling,\n\n2:37:49.600 --> 2:37:53.260\n not calling, but processing and thinking about that,\n\n2:37:53.260 --> 2:37:55.100\n I think that's certainly possible,\n\n2:37:55.100 --> 2:37:57.260\n and hopefully that's what we get.\n\n2:37:57.260 --> 2:38:01.020\n So the bigger question that you're asking\n\n2:38:01.020 --> 2:38:02.380\n about what gives me hope\n\n2:38:02.380 --> 2:38:07.380\n is that these early shocks of COVID lockdowns\n\n2:38:08.140 --> 2:38:11.620\n and remote work and all these different kinds of things,\n\n2:38:11.620 --> 2:38:13.980\n I think it's getting people to a point\n\n2:38:13.980 --> 2:38:18.980\n where they're sort of no longer in the reverie.\n\n2:38:19.740 --> 2:38:21.020\n As my friend Jim Rutt says,\n\n2:38:21.020 --> 2:38:23.700\n there's more people with ears to hear now.\n\n2:38:23.700 --> 2:38:26.100\n With the pandemic and education,\n\n2:38:26.100 --> 2:38:27.140\n everyone's like, wait, wait,\n\n2:38:27.140 --> 2:38:28.820\n what have you guys been doing with my kids?\n\n2:38:28.820 --> 2:38:30.140\n How are you teaching them?\n\n2:38:30.140 --> 2:38:32.420\n What is this crap you're giving them as homework?\n\n2:38:32.420 --> 2:38:33.940\n So I think these are the kinds of things\n\n2:38:33.940 --> 2:38:36.860\n that are getting, and the supply chain disruptions,\n\n2:38:36.860 --> 2:38:38.220\n getting more people to think about,\n\n2:38:38.220 --> 2:38:40.200\n how do we actually just make stuff?\n\n2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:44.820\n This is all good, but the concern is that\n\n2:38:44.820 --> 2:38:48.380\n it's still gonna take a while for these things,\n\n2:38:48.380 --> 2:38:50.620\n for people to learn how to be agentic again,\n\n2:38:51.860 --> 2:38:53.920\n and to be in right relationship with each other\n\n2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:55.860\n and with the world.\n\n2:38:55.860 --> 2:38:58.420\n So the message of hope is still people are resilient,\n\n2:38:58.420 --> 2:39:01.380\n and we are building some really amazing technology.\n\n2:39:01.380 --> 2:39:03.920\n And I also, to me, I derive a lot of hope\n\n2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:08.140\n from individuals in that van.\n\n2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:11.980\n The power of a single individual to transform the world,\n\n2:39:11.980 --> 2:39:14.700\n to do positive things for the world is quite incredible.\n\n2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:16.000\n Now you've been talking about,\n\n2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.860\n it's nice to have as many of those individuals as possible,\n\n2:39:18.860 --> 2:39:21.900\n but even the power of one, it's kind of magical.\n\n2:39:21.900 --> 2:39:22.740\n It is, it is.\n\n2:39:22.740 --> 2:39:24.500\n We're in a mode now where we can do that.\n\n2:39:24.500 --> 2:39:26.960\n I think also, part of what I try to do\n\n2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:29.020\n is in coming to podcasts like yours,\n\n2:39:29.020 --> 2:39:31.740\n and then spamming with all this philosophical stuff\n\n2:39:31.740 --> 2:39:33.540\n that I've got going on,\n\n2:39:33.540 --> 2:39:34.800\n there are a lot of good people out there\n\n2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:39.800\n trying to put words around the current technological,\n\n2:39:40.060 --> 2:39:43.220\n social, economic crises that we're facing.\n\n2:39:43.220 --> 2:39:44.580\n And in the space of a few short years,\n\n2:39:44.580 --> 2:39:46.340\n I think there has been a lot of great content\n\n2:39:46.340 --> 2:39:47.620\n produced around this stuff.\n\n2:39:47.620 --> 2:39:50.660\n For people who wanna see, wanna find out more,\n\n2:39:50.660 --> 2:39:52.140\n or think more about this,\n\n2:39:52.140 --> 2:39:54.540\n we're popularizing certain kinds of philosophical ideas\n\n2:39:54.540 --> 2:39:56.580\n that move people beyond just the,\n\n2:39:56.580 --> 2:39:58.700\n oh, you're communist, oh, you're capitalist kind of stuff.\n\n2:39:58.700 --> 2:40:01.200\n Like it's sort of, we're way past that now.\n\n2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:03.400\n So that also gives me hope,\n\n2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:05.700\n that I feel like I myself am getting a handle\n\n2:40:05.700 --> 2:40:07.500\n on how to think about these things.\n\n2:40:08.460 --> 2:40:09.940\n It makes me feel like I can,\n\n2:40:09.940 --> 2:40:12.560\n hopefully affect change for the better.\n\n2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:15.700\n We've been sneaking up on this question all over the place.\n\n2:40:15.700 --> 2:40:17.580\n Let me ask the big, ridiculous question.\n\n2:40:17.580 --> 2:40:20.380\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n2:40:20.380 --> 2:40:21.220\n Wow.\n\n2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:25.260\n The meaning of life.\n\n2:40:28.860 --> 2:40:29.700\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n2:40:29.700 --> 2:40:32.060\n I mean, I've never really understood that question.\n\n2:40:32.060 --> 2:40:34.700\n When you say meaning crisis,\n\n2:40:34.700 --> 2:40:39.700\n you're saying that there is a search\n\n2:40:39.860 --> 2:40:42.300\n for a kind of experience\n\n2:40:42.300 --> 2:40:45.480\n that could be described as fulfillment,\n\n2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:50.180\n as like the aha moment of just like joy,\n\n2:40:50.180 --> 2:40:53.400\n and maybe when you see something beautiful,\n\n2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:55.220\n or maybe you have created something beautiful,\n\n2:40:55.220 --> 2:40:57.200\n that experience that you get,\n\n2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:01.700\n it feels like it all makes sense.\n\n2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:04.340\n So some of that is just chemicals coming together\n\n2:41:04.340 --> 2:41:06.420\n in your mind and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:41:06.420 --> 2:41:08.820\n But it seems like we're building\n\n2:41:08.820 --> 2:41:12.620\n a sophisticated collective intelligence\n\n2:41:12.620 --> 2:41:15.300\n that's providing meaning in all kinds of ways\n\n2:41:15.300 --> 2:41:17.120\n to its members.\n\n2:41:17.120 --> 2:41:20.620\n And there's a theme to that meaning.\n\n2:41:20.620 --> 2:41:22.860\n So for a lot of history,\n\n2:41:22.860 --> 2:41:26.620\n I think faith played an important role.\n\n2:41:26.620 --> 2:41:29.660\n Faith in God, sort of religion.\n\n2:41:29.660 --> 2:41:32.660\n I think technology in the modern era\n\n2:41:32.660 --> 2:41:34.740\n is kind of serving a little bit\n\n2:41:34.740 --> 2:41:36.120\n of a source of meaning for people,\n\n2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:37.920\n like innovation of different kinds.\n\n2:41:39.580 --> 2:41:43.500\n I think the old school things of love\n\n2:41:43.500 --> 2:41:46.500\n and the basics of just being good at stuff.\n\n2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:50.300\n But you were a physicist,\n\n2:41:50.300 --> 2:41:52.580\n so there's a desire to say, okay, yeah,\n\n2:41:52.580 --> 2:41:56.300\n but these seem to be like symptoms of something deeper.\n\n2:41:56.300 --> 2:41:57.140\n Right.\n\n2:41:57.140 --> 2:41:57.960\n Like why?\n\n2:41:57.960 --> 2:41:59.060\n A little meaning, what's capital M meaning?\n\n2:41:59.060 --> 2:42:00.960\n Yeah, what's capital M meaning?\n\n2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:03.080\n Why are we reaching for order\n\n2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:05.120\n when there is excess of energy?\n\n2:42:06.940 --> 2:42:09.340\n I don't know if I can answer the why.\n\n2:42:09.340 --> 2:42:11.840\n Any why that I come up with, I think, is gonna be,\n\n2:42:13.700 --> 2:42:15.500\n I'd have to think about that a little more,\n\n2:42:15.500 --> 2:42:17.040\n maybe get back to you on that.\n\n2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:18.240\n But I will say this.\n\n2:42:19.260 --> 2:42:22.280\n We do look at the world through a traditional,\n\n2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:24.220\n I think most people look at the world through\n\n2:42:24.220 --> 2:42:25.980\n what I would say is a subject object\n\n2:42:25.980 --> 2:42:27.200\n to kind of metaphysical lens,\n\n2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:29.620\n that we have our own subjectivity,\n\n2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:34.220\n and then there's all of these object things that are not us.\n\n2:42:34.220 --> 2:42:37.220\n So I'm me, and these things are not me, right?\n\n2:42:37.220 --> 2:42:39.880\n And I'm interacting with them, I'm doing things to them.\n\n2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:41.380\n But a different view of the world\n\n2:42:41.380 --> 2:42:44.220\n that looks at it as much more connected,\n\n2:42:44.220 --> 2:42:49.220\n that realizes, oh, I'm really quite embedded\n\n2:42:49.220 --> 2:42:50.680\n in a soup of other things,\n\n2:42:50.680 --> 2:42:54.060\n and I'm simply almost like a standing wave pattern\n\n2:42:54.060 --> 2:42:55.920\n of different things, right?\n\n2:42:55.920 --> 2:42:58.020\n So when you look at the world\n\n2:42:58.020 --> 2:42:59.140\n in that kind of connected sense,\n\n2:42:59.140 --> 2:43:02.980\n I've recently taken a shine\n\n2:43:02.980 --> 2:43:04.540\n to this particular thought experiment,\n\n2:43:04.540 --> 2:43:07.260\n which is what if it was the case\n\n2:43:08.560 --> 2:43:12.380\n that everything that we touch with our hands,\n\n2:43:12.380 --> 2:43:13.880\n that we pay attention to,\n\n2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:16.300\n that we actually give intimacy to,\n\n2:43:16.300 --> 2:43:21.300\n what if there's actually all the mumbo jumbo,\n\n2:43:21.300 --> 2:43:25.100\n like people with the magnetic healing crystals\n\n2:43:25.100 --> 2:43:28.240\n and all this other kind of stuff and quantum energy stuff,\n\n2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:30.340\n what if that was a thing?\n\n2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:34.140\n What if literally when your hand touches an object,\n\n2:43:34.140 --> 2:43:35.420\n when you really look at something\n\n2:43:35.420 --> 2:43:36.840\n and you concentrate and you focus on it\n\n2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:39.020\n and you really give it attention,\n\n2:43:39.020 --> 2:43:40.580\n you actually give it,\n\n2:43:40.580 --> 2:43:44.240\n there is some physical residue of something,\n\n2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:48.120\n a part of you, a bit of your life force that goes into it.\n\n2:43:48.120 --> 2:43:51.500\n Okay, now this is of course completely mumbo jumbo stuff.\n\n2:43:51.500 --> 2:43:53.680\n This is not like, I don't actually think this is real,\n\n2:43:53.680 --> 2:43:55.640\n but let's do the thought experiment.\n\n2:43:55.640 --> 2:43:57.720\n What if it was?\n\n2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:01.720\n What if there actually was some quantum magnetic crystal\n\n2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:05.320\n and energy field thing that just by touching this can,\n\n2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:08.920\n this can has changed a little bit somehow.\n\n2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:11.940\n And it's not much unless you put a lot into it\n\n2:44:11.940 --> 2:44:15.000\n and you touch it all the time, like your phone, right?\n\n2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:18.340\n These things gained, they gain meaning to you a little bit,\n\n2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:22.440\n but what if there's something that,\n\n2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:25.240\n technical objects, the phone is a technical object,\n\n2:44:25.240 --> 2:44:29.160\n it does not really receive attention or intimacy\n\n2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:31.980\n and then allow itself to be transformed by it.\n\n2:44:31.980 --> 2:44:33.360\n But if it's a piece of wood,\n\n2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:36.720\n if it's the handle of a knife that your mother used\n\n2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:40.340\n for 20 years to make dinner for you, right?\n\n2:44:40.340 --> 2:44:43.860\n What if it's a keyboard that you banged out,\n\n2:44:43.860 --> 2:44:46.400\n your world transforming software library on?\n\n2:44:46.400 --> 2:44:47.840\n These are technical objects\n\n2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:48.780\n and these are physical objects,\n\n2:44:48.780 --> 2:44:51.400\n but somehow there's something to them.\n\n2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:53.320\n We feel an attraction to these objects\n\n2:44:53.320 --> 2:44:56.980\n as if we have imbued them with life energy, right?\n\n2:44:56.980 --> 2:44:58.760\n So if you walk that thought experiment through,\n\n2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:00.440\n what happens when we touch another person,\n\n2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:02.200\n when we hug them, when we hold them?\n\n2:45:03.160 --> 2:45:07.800\n And the reason this ties into my answer for your question\n\n2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:12.800\n is that if there is such a thing,\n\n2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:13.680\n if there is such a thing,\n\n2:45:13.680 --> 2:45:15.660\n if we were to hypothesize, you know,\n\n2:45:15.660 --> 2:45:17.160\n hypothesize it's such a thing,\n\n2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:23.440\n it could be that the purpose of our lives\n\n2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:27.580\n is to imbue as many things with that love as possible.\n\n2:45:30.640 --> 2:45:32.820\n That's a beautiful answer\n\n2:45:32.820 --> 2:45:35.240\n and a beautiful way to end it, Peter.\n\n2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:36.600\n You're an incredible person.\n\n2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:37.440\n Thank you.\n\n2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:41.520\n Spanning so much in the space of engineering\n\n2:45:41.520 --> 2:45:43.360\n and in the space of philosophy.\n\n2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:49.000\n I'm really proud to be living in the same city as you\n\n2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:51.120\n and I'm really grateful\n\n2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:53.000\n that you would spend your valuable time with me today.\n\n2:45:53.000 --> 2:45:53.840\n Thank you so much.\n\n2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:54.660\n Well, thank you.\n\n2:45:54.660 --> 2:45:56.560\n I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.\n\n2:45:56.560 --> 2:45:59.240\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Peter Wang.\n\n2:45:59.240 --> 2:46:00.600\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:03.520\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:46:03.520 --> 2:46:05.680\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:07.960\n from Peter Wang himself.\n\n2:46:07.960 --> 2:46:09.480\n We tend to think of people\n\n2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:12.480\n as either malicious or incompetent,\n\n2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:15.200\n but in a world filled with corruptible\n\n2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:17.120\n and unchecked institutions,\n\n2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:21.080\n there exists a third thing, malicious incompetence.\n\n2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:22.620\n It's a social cancer\n\n2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:26.000\n and it only appears once human organizations scale\n\n2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:27.840\n beyond personal accountability.\n\n2:46:27.840 --> 2:46:40.260\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
