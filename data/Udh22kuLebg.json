--> 00:10.420\n He worked for Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa,\n\n00:10.420 --> 00:13.460\n the leaders behind the Medellin Cartel.\n\n00:13.460 --> 00:17.420\n Roger was the employer and close friend of Barry Seal,\n\n00:17.420 --> 00:20.060\n the infamous drug smuggler who was the main character\n\n00:20.060 --> 00:22.060\n in the movie American Maid.\n\n00:22.060 --> 00:26.320\n Roger transported countless tons of cocaine and marijuana\n\n00:26.320 --> 00:27.980\n covering six continents.\n\n00:27.980 --> 00:30.200\n He escaped prison five times,\n\n00:30.200 --> 00:32.400\n was shut down in both Mexico and Colombia,\n\n00:32.400 --> 00:36.920\n and was tortured nearly to death in a Mexican prison.\n\n00:36.920 --> 00:40.920\n Through all of this, his wife Mari, the love of his life,\n\n00:40.920 --> 00:43.600\n was there with him, and when he was in prison,\n\n00:43.600 --> 00:45.200\n she waited for him.\n\n00:45.200 --> 00:47.820\n He recently got out of prison where for many years\n\n00:47.820 --> 00:50.680\n he worked on his memoir called Smuggler.\n\n00:50.680 --> 00:54.180\n This podcast is an exploration of his story.\n\n00:54.180 --> 00:56.200\n Quick mention of our sponsors.\n\n00:56.200 --> 01:01.200\n Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN, Four Sigmatic, and Aidsleep.\n\n01:01.920 --> 01:04.880\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n01:04.880 --> 01:06.920\n Let me say a few words about Roger Reeves,\n\n01:06.920 --> 01:09.920\n Pablo Escobar, and the war on drugs.\n\n01:09.920 --> 01:13.320\n This conversation with Roger is unlike any I've ever done.\n\n01:13.320 --> 01:15.840\n In the eyes of many, including the law,\n\n01:15.840 --> 01:18.720\n Roger is a criminal, a bad man who was added\n\n01:18.720 --> 01:20.560\n to the suffering in the world.\n\n01:20.560 --> 01:23.160\n But he never directly engaged or participated\n\n01:23.160 --> 01:24.420\n in the violence.\n\n01:24.420 --> 01:28.340\n Unlike his bosses, Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa.\n\n01:29.280 --> 01:32.080\n His crime was the transport of drugs.\n\n01:32.080 --> 01:35.280\n I thought about this, and about Pablo Escobar,\n\n01:35.280 --> 01:38.080\n who was at once both a brutal murderer\n\n01:38.080 --> 01:40.680\n and a Robin Hood figure who helped the poor\n\n01:40.680 --> 01:44.200\n and was loved by thousands, if not millions.\n\n01:44.200 --> 01:48.240\n We sometimes idolize murderers and destroy good, honest men.\n\n01:48.240 --> 01:50.600\n We give power and money to corrupt politicians\n\n01:50.600 --> 01:53.960\n and dictators that starve and murder their own people.\n\n01:53.960 --> 01:57.400\n Given this, I think about what makes for a good man,\n\n01:57.400 --> 02:01.440\n and what makes for a bad man, and who decides.\n\n02:01.440 --> 02:04.720\n Sitting across from Roger, I saw a complicated man,\n\n02:04.720 --> 02:06.960\n but one who has kindness in his heart,\n\n02:06.960 --> 02:11.960\n a love for money and adventure, and a disdain for violence.\n\n02:11.960 --> 02:14.680\n Again, his crime was the transport of drugs.\n\n02:14.680 --> 02:19.680\n Since 1971, the war on drugs has cost U.S. $1 trillion.\n\n02:20.040 --> 02:22.560\n Marijuana legalization alone would save\n\n02:22.560 --> 02:26.680\n and make $13.7 billion, that could send\n\n02:26.680 --> 02:28.760\n more than 650,000 students\n\n02:28.760 --> 02:31.280\n to public universities every year.\n\n02:31.280 --> 02:34.880\n Then there's the human stories of the 500,000 human beings\n\n02:34.880 --> 02:37.440\n sitting in prison for drug related offenses,\n\n02:37.440 --> 02:40.800\n and the 1.1 million on probation and parole.\n\n02:40.800 --> 02:44.100\n Their life is damaged or ruined beyond repair\n\n02:44.100 --> 02:46.400\n due to the prohibition of drugs.\n\n02:46.400 --> 02:48.840\n There's a lot more to be said about the damage done\n\n02:48.840 --> 02:52.360\n by the war on drugs, but when reading about Roger's story\n\n02:52.360 --> 02:55.280\n and talking to him, I couldn't escape the thought\n\n02:55.280 --> 02:57.960\n that while society wants to label him a criminal\n\n02:57.960 --> 03:01.520\n and a bad human being, there are much worse men out there\n\n03:01.520 --> 03:04.740\n who we give a pass to, even give power to,\n\n03:04.740 --> 03:09.120\n even men who hold political office or run companies.\n\n03:09.120 --> 03:11.940\n I also think about my role as an interviewer,\n\n03:11.940 --> 03:14.080\n sitting across a man like Roger.\n\n03:14.080 --> 03:16.640\n In these interviews, in life,\n\n03:16.640 --> 03:19.020\n in many ways I continue to be myself,\n\n03:19.020 --> 03:21.940\n a person who like Dostoyevsky's The Idiot,\n\n03:21.940 --> 03:24.160\n seeks the good in all people,\n\n03:24.160 --> 03:26.180\n but is hurt by it on occasion,\n\n03:26.180 --> 03:29.740\n and maybe is destroyed by it in the end.\n\n03:29.740 --> 03:32.380\n I'm not naive, but I'm also optimistic\n\n03:32.380 --> 03:34.420\n and have hope for humanity.\n\n03:34.420 --> 03:37.720\n That's who I am, and that's what these conversations are.\n\n03:37.720 --> 03:40.640\n I hope you join me, and I hope you understand\n\n03:40.640 --> 03:43.160\n that I come from a place of love.\n\n03:43.160 --> 03:45.200\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,\n\n03:45.200 --> 03:48.240\n and here's my conversation with Roger Reeves.\n\n03:48.240 --> 03:53.140\n You are one of the most prolific drug smugglers in history.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:55.840\n What would you say motivated you?\n\n03:55.840 --> 03:59.420\n Money, power, the thrill, or was it something else?\n\n03:59.420 --> 04:00.440\n Money.\n\n04:00.440 --> 04:04.200\n But isn't there a point where you've had more money\n\n04:04.200 --> 04:06.360\n than you can possibly know what to do with,\n\n04:06.360 --> 04:07.840\n or is it always more money?\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:13.080\n You know, I had plenty of money several times,\n\n04:13.080 --> 04:17.160\n and I think it's sort of like if you was in Las Vegas\n\n04:17.160 --> 04:20.480\n and you had the slot machine handled down,\n\n04:20.480 --> 04:22.560\n and the gold coins was tumbling around you,\n\n04:22.560 --> 04:25.360\n and you had sweepers bagging them up,\n\n04:25.360 --> 04:27.280\n when would you let it go?\n\n04:27.280 --> 04:29.960\n But isn't some part of that the thrill then?\n\n04:29.960 --> 04:33.120\n Oh, there was a lot of thrill, sometimes way too much.\n\n04:33.120 --> 04:35.960\n You made certainly tens of millions of dollars,\n\n04:35.960 --> 04:37.040\n probably much more.\n\n04:37.040 --> 04:38.920\n What memorable experience\n\n04:38.920 --> 04:41.720\n did having that much money make possible for you?\n\n04:41.720 --> 04:44.120\n So there's one thing is the money,\n\n04:44.120 --> 04:47.320\n and the other thing is what that money can buy.\n\n04:47.320 --> 04:50.280\n Well, I bought everything that I could hide.\n\n04:50.280 --> 04:52.200\n I bought seven farms.\n\n04:52.200 --> 04:55.760\n I owned the city,\n\n04:55.760 --> 04:59.320\n the land where the city of Moreno Valley, California is.\n\n04:59.320 --> 05:01.040\n I had an option on that land.\n\n05:01.040 --> 05:03.300\n Did the planning and development of that.\n\n05:04.440 --> 05:06.360\n The most expensive coin in the world.\n\n05:09.120 --> 05:12.360\n Yachts, ships, airplanes galore.\n\n05:12.360 --> 05:13.760\n Did that bring you happiness?\n\n05:13.760 --> 05:16.880\n No, absolutely not.\n\n05:16.880 --> 05:18.280\n In fact, I think I'm happier now.\n\n05:18.280 --> 05:19.800\n I know I'm happier now.\n\n05:19.800 --> 05:24.640\n So looking back, would you do it the same way all again?\n\n05:24.640 --> 05:25.680\n No way.\n\n05:26.640 --> 05:28.360\n Really, even the thrill of it?\n\n05:28.360 --> 05:29.680\n Not even thrill of it.\n\n05:29.680 --> 05:31.880\n It wasn't worth 33 years in prison,\n\n05:31.880 --> 05:33.620\n being away from my lovely family.\n\n05:34.900 --> 05:37.980\n So money, what about the power?\n\n05:37.980 --> 05:41.000\n Just being on top of the world where nobody can,\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:46.000\n not the governments, the police,\n\n05:46.320 --> 05:50.320\n all the big, bad agencies chasing you,\n\n05:50.320 --> 05:52.740\n and you could do whatever the heck you wanted.\n\n05:52.740 --> 05:54.860\n As far as having to look over your shoulder\n\n05:54.860 --> 05:58.060\n everywhere you went and every phone call you made,\n\n05:58.060 --> 06:00.560\n make sure that you was naked with somebody in the ocean\n\n06:00.560 --> 06:01.520\n before you talked.\n\n06:03.640 --> 06:05.040\n It's rather uncomfortable.\n\n06:05.040 --> 06:05.880\n Yeah.\n\n06:07.840 --> 06:09.840\n I like to make phone calls the same way.\n\n06:09.840 --> 06:14.840\n What was it like meeting and working with Pablo Escobar,\n\n06:15.640 --> 06:17.420\n the leader of the Medellin Cartel?\n\n06:18.320 --> 06:21.320\n He was just, just seemed like a gentleman when I met him.\n\n06:21.320 --> 06:23.280\n He was just like you and I, sitting here, shook hands,\n\n06:23.280 --> 06:26.600\n and I had flown one load for a fellow,\n\n06:26.600 --> 06:28.920\n and it didn't work out well.\n\n06:28.920 --> 06:30.600\n The fellow that I gave it to got shot,\n\n06:30.600 --> 06:31.920\n and it took a while to get my money,\n\n06:31.920 --> 06:34.000\n and they didn't put as many kilos on the plane\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:34.840\n as they're supposed to,\n\n06:34.840 --> 06:37.200\n and so I wasn't gonna work with him anymore,\n\n06:37.200 --> 06:39.160\n and my contact down there introduced me\n\n06:39.160 --> 06:43.440\n to Jorge Ochoa, and we went up,\n\n06:43.440 --> 06:45.680\n and in Vigado, we went up and the gate opened,\n\n06:45.680 --> 06:47.200\n and we was escorted in.\n\n06:47.200 --> 06:49.840\n There must have been 50 men out in the yards,\n\n06:49.840 --> 06:52.480\n hitching a rail on an old house,\n\n06:52.480 --> 06:54.720\n and we was escorted right in,\n\n06:54.720 --> 06:57.040\n and there was a beautiful woman in there.\n\n06:57.040 --> 06:59.760\n I mean, gore, drop dead beautiful,\n\n06:59.760 --> 07:02.440\n and she made us a cup of coffee,\n\n07:02.440 --> 07:06.040\n then ushered in to see Jorge Ochoa,\n\n07:06.040 --> 07:08.160\n and he had 12 telephones on his desk,\n\n07:08.160 --> 07:09.880\n and all of them was a different color,\n\n07:09.880 --> 07:12.480\n and he shook hands, was very friendly, spoke English,\n\n07:13.720 --> 07:15.840\n and he said that each one of those telephones\n\n07:15.840 --> 07:18.280\n represented another city in the United States.\n\n07:18.280 --> 07:20.360\n This is Chicago, and this is New York.\n\n07:20.360 --> 07:22.720\n If I ring, I knew who was calling,\n\n07:22.720 --> 07:24.440\n and so we chatted a while,\n\n07:24.440 --> 07:26.840\n and he asked me what type of airplanes I had\n\n07:28.040 --> 07:31.480\n and what experience I had flying across the U.S. border,\n\n07:31.480 --> 07:35.080\n and I told him he seemed pleased with it,\n\n07:35.080 --> 07:37.680\n and he called the lady in, and she went next door,\n\n07:37.680 --> 07:39.520\n and in came Pablo Escobar,\n\n07:39.520 --> 07:41.320\n and he introduced me to Pablo Escobar,\n\n07:41.320 --> 07:43.560\n and he asked the same questions again,\n\n07:43.560 --> 07:48.560\n and I answered him, and I asked him how much he paid,\n\n07:49.600 --> 07:53.000\n and he paid $5,000 a kilo to haul it,\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.520\n and so I said, how much you put on the plane?\n\n07:55.520 --> 07:59.240\n He said 300, 500, so that's one and a half,\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:01.520\n two and a half million dollars for an eight hour trip.\n\n08:01.520 --> 08:02.840\n Sounded pretty good to me.\n\n08:02.840 --> 08:04.720\n And we're talking about cocaine.\n\n08:04.720 --> 08:05.560\n Cocaine. And we're talking\n\n08:05.560 --> 08:06.520\n about Colombia.\n\n08:06.520 --> 08:09.160\n Colombia, and cocaine, and Medellin cartel.\n\n08:09.160 --> 08:12.560\n And Jorge Ochoa was one of the, what would you say,\n\n08:12.560 --> 08:14.200\n founding members of the Medellin?\n\n08:14.200 --> 08:16.160\n He was probably the brains behind the whole thing.\n\n08:16.160 --> 08:17.760\n The brains, and spoke good English.\n\n08:17.760 --> 08:18.600\n Yes.\n\n08:18.600 --> 08:19.880\n And they were nice people.\n\n08:19.880 --> 08:21.440\n Really nice people.\n\n08:21.440 --> 08:22.560\n Were you scared?\n\n08:22.560 --> 08:23.640\n Not at all.\n\n08:23.640 --> 08:26.400\n What's wrong with your mind that you weren't scared?\n\n08:26.400 --> 08:30.000\n Here's some of the most dangerous men in this world,\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:31.120\n and you weren't scared.\n\n08:31.120 --> 08:33.000\n Well, I knew I was gonna do exactly what I said\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.080\n I was gonna do.\n\n08:34.080 --> 08:35.400\n Murray and the children were down there.\n\n08:35.400 --> 08:37.080\n They went down and they stayed in the hotel,\n\n08:37.080 --> 08:40.240\n five stars, treated royally on my first load.\n\n08:40.240 --> 08:42.640\n And they just did ask security to make sure\n\n08:42.640 --> 08:44.680\n that I wasn't a DEA agent.\n\n08:44.680 --> 08:47.440\n So I did the first load,\n\n08:47.440 --> 08:49.960\n and they can say they were hostages,\n\n08:49.960 --> 08:51.120\n but they really weren't.\n\n08:51.120 --> 08:53.000\n It was just insurance.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.240\n So there was some integrity to the way they operated.\n\n08:56.240 --> 08:57.400\n Completely.\n\n08:57.400 --> 09:00.160\n I mean, straight up.\n\n09:00.160 --> 09:02.360\n The money was ironed and banded,\n\n09:02.360 --> 09:04.960\n banded and just right.\n\n09:04.960 --> 09:09.280\n And the numbers were never once anything wrong with it.\n\n09:09.280 --> 09:11.600\n What would you attribute that honesty to?\n\n09:11.600 --> 09:16.600\n Within their own moral system and their own set of rules,\n\n09:17.600 --> 09:20.040\n why weren't people crossing the line\n\n09:20.040 --> 09:24.440\n and shaving off the top and injecting chaos\n\n09:24.440 --> 09:28.080\n into the system to where it would be unpredictable\n\n09:28.080 --> 09:30.160\n and people would be dishonest and greedy\n\n09:30.160 --> 09:31.800\n and all those kinds of things?\n\n09:31.800 --> 09:32.640\n That's true.\n\n09:32.640 --> 09:34.200\n Most people are, but there's certain people\n\n09:34.200 --> 09:37.560\n at the top of the food chain that they don't need that.\n\n09:37.560 --> 09:40.520\n And if they're completely honest,\n\n09:40.520 --> 09:41.840\n then they don't have to think of,\n\n09:41.840 --> 09:43.960\n remember the lie they told.\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:45.880\n And plus they're just honest to start with.\n\n09:45.880 --> 09:48.320\n They're making plenty of money.\n\n09:48.320 --> 09:50.280\n They was making as much money as I did.\n\n09:51.600 --> 09:54.920\n I'll tell you how that came about.\n\n09:54.920 --> 09:57.920\n I understand that 10,000 people were killed every year\n\n09:57.920 --> 10:00.600\n in Medellin, Colombia, and what they were doing,\n\n10:00.600 --> 10:03.760\n they didn't have any organization.\n\n10:03.760 --> 10:06.480\n And if one fellow had 10 kilos\n\n10:06.480 --> 10:08.840\n and he wanted it shipped to New York,\n\n10:08.840 --> 10:10.800\n he would tell his friend and his friend says,\n\n10:10.800 --> 10:11.640\n sure, I'll ship it.\n\n10:11.640 --> 10:13.160\n I have a pilot and I'll ship it up.\n\n10:13.160 --> 10:14.840\n And then he would look in the newspapers,\n\n10:14.840 --> 10:17.200\n oh, 40 kilos was busted in New Jersey.\n\n10:17.200 --> 10:19.520\n I'm so sorry, yours got busted.\n\n10:19.520 --> 10:20.800\n Bang, bang, he's dead.\n\n10:22.600 --> 10:26.960\n So here comes Jorge Ochoa and the three Ochoa brothers\n\n10:26.960 --> 10:28.640\n and Pablo Escobar and Gacho.\n\n10:28.640 --> 10:32.440\n And they decided that we will make an insurance company,\n\n10:33.400 --> 10:35.560\n that we will charge you $10,000\n\n10:35.560 --> 10:38.360\n to take it to your contact in Miami.\n\n10:39.960 --> 10:43.000\n If it gets lost anywhere between the time I put it\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.320\n on the airplane or the time you give it to us\n\n10:45.320 --> 10:47.280\n and the time we give it to your man,\n\n10:47.280 --> 10:50.400\n we will replace it in Colombia for you.\n\n10:50.400 --> 10:52.680\n So there was no way anybody could lose.\n\n10:52.680 --> 10:55.200\n And I understand they got a hundred tons piled up\n\n10:56.240 --> 10:57.920\n under that insurance program.\n\n10:57.920 --> 10:59.720\n And I was right there the first day.\n\n11:00.720 --> 11:03.360\n So I had all the work I could do.\n\n11:03.360 --> 11:05.800\n I would land and I said, when do you want me to come back?\n\n11:05.800 --> 11:07.320\n We're waiting on you, Senor.\n\n11:08.640 --> 11:10.400\n Well, let me ask a difficult question.\n\n11:10.400 --> 11:14.080\n Some see Escobar as a brutal murderer\n\n11:14.080 --> 11:17.800\n and some see him as maybe a Robin Hood like figure\n\n11:17.800 --> 11:19.560\n who helped the poor.\n\n11:19.560 --> 11:20.840\n How do you see the man?\n\n11:20.840 --> 11:22.360\n Both of them.\n\n11:22.360 --> 11:25.160\n I think he started out to be honest with help the poor.\n\n11:25.160 --> 11:27.040\n And then they had a war down there\n\n11:27.040 --> 11:29.320\n and they blew up and killed his people.\n\n11:29.320 --> 11:32.920\n And the country was divided almost equally three ways.\n\n11:32.920 --> 11:36.040\n They had the military.\n\n11:36.040 --> 11:38.200\n They were just as much into it as anybody.\n\n11:38.200 --> 11:40.520\n And then you had the FARC guerrillas.\n\n11:40.520 --> 11:42.720\n They had about a third of the country.\n\n11:42.720 --> 11:43.960\n And then you had the Contras.\n\n11:43.960 --> 11:46.120\n It was like the white farmers\n\n11:46.120 --> 11:48.400\n and they're the ones that I was dealing with\n\n11:48.400 --> 11:50.840\n and they were at war with one another.\n\n11:50.840 --> 11:53.680\n And so if one of them started killing their people,\n\n11:53.680 --> 11:55.760\n well, I'll kill some of yours too.\n\n11:55.760 --> 11:57.240\n So that's how it happened.\n\n11:57.240 --> 11:59.960\n And then when I heard about Pablo Escobar\n\n11:59.960 --> 12:01.080\n blowing up that airliner\n\n12:01.080 --> 12:02.840\n and killing those women and children,\n\n12:02.840 --> 12:05.040\n I was sorry I ever shook his hand.\n\n12:05.040 --> 12:07.080\n That's brutal murder.\n\n12:07.080 --> 12:10.640\n So you would say Escobar is not a good man?\n\n12:10.640 --> 12:11.560\n Not at all.\n\n12:11.560 --> 12:13.240\n He's terrible.\n\n12:13.240 --> 12:16.840\n Now, looking back on it, when I met him, he was good.\n\n12:16.840 --> 12:19.520\n Did just exactly what he said he would do.\n\n12:19.520 --> 12:22.800\n Could he be a bad man and a man you can trust?\n\n12:22.800 --> 12:23.640\n Are those the things you...\n\n12:23.640 --> 12:25.840\n Absolutely you could trust him, yes.\n\n12:27.560 --> 12:31.440\n So from your perspective, in terms of business,\n\n12:31.440 --> 12:35.600\n he was reliable, he was honest, had integrity.\n\n12:35.600 --> 12:38.280\n You could work with him and he felt safe.\n\n12:38.280 --> 12:39.720\n Completely.\n\n12:39.720 --> 12:41.640\n We flew up to his ranch\n\n12:41.640 --> 12:45.440\n and we brought out motorcycles to start with.\n\n12:45.440 --> 12:46.560\n And can you ride a motorcycle?\n\n12:46.560 --> 12:48.160\n Of course I can ride a motorcycle.\n\n12:48.160 --> 12:50.080\n So I took off across the grass\n\n12:50.080 --> 12:51.840\n and there was a little ditch there\n\n12:51.840 --> 12:53.720\n and the front wheel dropped in that thing\n\n12:53.720 --> 12:56.560\n and I must have slid across that grass 20 feet\n\n12:56.560 --> 12:57.560\n before I got stopped.\n\n12:57.560 --> 13:00.240\n He almost fell off of his bike waiting\n\n13:00.240 --> 13:01.920\n because they knew what it was gonna do.\n\n13:01.920 --> 13:04.120\n And then we got on horses and we went out there\n\n13:04.120 --> 13:06.720\n and pretended to round up some cows\n\n13:06.720 --> 13:09.800\n and he put a Mac 10 machine gun pistol over my shoulder.\n\n13:09.800 --> 13:10.920\n Do you know how to use this?\n\n13:10.920 --> 13:13.080\n Well, I never had, but it was all right.\n\n13:13.080 --> 13:16.160\n I think it was like, okay, you got 10 bodyguards,\n\n13:16.160 --> 13:17.840\n what do you need me for?\n\n13:17.840 --> 13:19.880\n So that's the kind of time we laughed and talked\n\n13:19.880 --> 13:23.000\n and drove some cows over the stumps.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.960\n You said Jorge Ochoa was perhaps the brains\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:28.480\n of the Medellin cartel.\n\n13:30.320 --> 13:31.640\n What was he like?\n\n13:31.640 --> 13:35.160\n And why do you say he was the brains?\n\n13:35.160 --> 13:36.400\n Well, he was a gentleman.\n\n13:37.360 --> 13:39.400\n And I suppose he shipped,\n\n13:39.400 --> 13:41.880\n and don't tell me how many more times of cocaine\n\n13:41.880 --> 13:43.320\n than Pablo did.\n\n13:43.320 --> 13:44.720\n Just him and his brothers,\n\n13:44.720 --> 13:47.880\n you could tell by the, they had on each load,\n\n13:47.880 --> 13:51.120\n they was in duffel bags and his big football shaped\n\n13:52.520 --> 13:55.240\n fluffy stuff made with ether.\n\n13:55.240 --> 13:58.600\n And they would have three horns on it\n\n13:58.600 --> 14:02.080\n or a rattlesnake or four Xs on each bag.\n\n14:02.080 --> 14:04.360\n You kind of got to knowing which was which\n\n14:04.360 --> 14:05.720\n and they shipped a lot.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.600\n So, and he was just a gentleman.\n\n14:09.600 --> 14:12.520\n I took the family, we went one weekend to his ranch\n\n14:12.520 --> 14:17.520\n or his palatial place out near Barranquilla\n\n14:17.520 --> 14:20.360\n and oh, he just treated the family.\n\n14:20.360 --> 14:24.680\n His family had, his younger brother made a bull fight\n\n14:24.680 --> 14:29.680\n and we had skiing and little airplanes on floats\n\n14:30.280 --> 14:32.000\n on the water.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.160\n He was really nice and he was really nice.\n\n14:36.200 --> 14:39.440\n How do you make sense of the tension\n\n14:39.440 --> 14:42.040\n that a man could be a gentleman,\n\n14:42.040 --> 14:44.680\n can have integrity, but also be a murderer?\n\n14:44.680 --> 14:49.000\n Well, murder is a stronger word than killing.\n\n14:50.040 --> 14:52.920\n Can you explain the line,\n\n14:52.920 --> 14:55.000\n the gray area we're talking about?\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.160\n I mean, I've just talking with Jocko Willing,\n\n14:57.160 --> 15:00.400\n can we talk a lot about killing in the context\n\n15:00.400 --> 15:05.400\n of military conflict in the context of war?\n\n15:05.440 --> 15:08.720\n So there, there's a line between murder and killing\n\n15:08.720 --> 15:09.920\n that you can draw.\n\n15:09.920 --> 15:11.960\n What's the line that you're referring to?\n\n15:11.960 --> 15:13.160\n It's something similar.\n\n15:13.160 --> 15:14.920\n If people are shooting at you\n\n15:14.920 --> 15:16.360\n and you shoot back and kill him,\n\n15:16.360 --> 15:17.840\n that's not murder whatsoever.\n\n15:17.840 --> 15:22.240\n He's trying to get away or out of the situation.\n\n15:22.240 --> 15:25.560\n But if some woman don't pay you\n\n15:25.560 --> 15:27.960\n and you send a hit man over to kill her\n\n15:27.960 --> 15:30.840\n and her children, that's murder.\n\n15:30.840 --> 15:33.280\n Was Jorge involved in those kinds of things?\n\n15:33.280 --> 15:34.880\n I don't think so at all.\n\n15:34.880 --> 15:36.480\n I mean, he was just such a gentleman.\n\n15:36.480 --> 15:39.880\n He had a restaurant before and he was just smart.\n\n15:39.880 --> 15:42.720\n I understand that the first 10 kilos he sold,\n\n15:42.720 --> 15:46.200\n he was sitting on a motorcycle in the sidelines\n\n15:46.200 --> 15:48.040\n in a parking lot and when the DEA come in,\n\n15:48.040 --> 15:49.520\n he sped away.\n\n15:49.520 --> 15:51.240\n So he didn't come back to America.\n\n15:51.240 --> 15:52.080\n He was just smart.\n\n15:52.080 --> 15:53.760\n Some people just are savvy.\n\n15:53.760 --> 15:55.320\n And he was such a gentleman.\n\n15:55.320 --> 15:57.680\n And the whole family, the mother and the father,\n\n15:57.680 --> 15:59.760\n the two brothers, their sister,\n\n15:59.760 --> 16:01.440\n I was there when she was kidnapped.\n\n16:01.440 --> 16:05.560\n And finally, he kidnapped our, I guess,\n\n16:05.560 --> 16:10.400\n 100 leaders of the FARC and said, all right,\n\n16:10.400 --> 16:11.240\n when she don't come back,\n\n16:11.240 --> 16:13.320\n none of these are gonna come back.\n\n16:13.320 --> 16:15.440\n So they made a deal.\n\n16:15.440 --> 16:17.800\n Is there something you can say about the power structure,\n\n16:17.800 --> 16:20.240\n the hierarchy of the Medellin cartel\n\n16:20.240 --> 16:21.960\n that you interacted with?\n\n16:21.960 --> 16:26.000\n Was it a dictatorship where Pablo ran everything?\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.320\n Was there a bunch of power centers?\n\n16:28.320 --> 16:32.640\n Was it like a company where you have CEO, CTO kind of thing?\n\n16:32.640 --> 16:34.040\n And then there's like managers\n\n16:34.040 --> 16:35.360\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n16:35.360 --> 16:39.520\n How did it run from a leadership perspective?\n\n16:39.520 --> 16:43.440\n I understand that about five of them got together\n\n16:43.440 --> 16:46.920\n and made this, I would call it an insurance company.\n\n16:46.920 --> 16:50.440\n And now known as the Medellin Cartel.\n\n16:50.440 --> 16:51.640\n And I didn't see any difference.\n\n16:51.640 --> 16:55.080\n Each one of them had their own business.\n\n16:55.080 --> 16:59.880\n And their people from the jungle or wherever made the cocaine,\n\n16:59.880 --> 17:02.120\n gave it to them and they shipped it.\n\n17:02.120 --> 17:05.760\n And so it didn't seem to be any power play\n\n17:05.760 --> 17:07.560\n between them at all.\n\n17:07.560 --> 17:10.200\n But my main contact was Jorge Ochoa\n\n17:10.200 --> 17:12.920\n and Pablo Escobar was right there.\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:15.160\n And I saw plenty of stuff for him too.\n\n17:16.040 --> 17:20.640\n It's strange that they didn't betray each other regularly.\n\n17:20.640 --> 17:25.200\n You know, greed makes men betray each other.\n\n17:25.200 --> 17:26.400\n How do you explain that?\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:29.360\n How much betrayal did you see?\n\n17:29.360 --> 17:32.720\n I didn't see any, absolutely none.\n\n17:32.720 --> 17:36.280\n If they shipped his 100 kilos, he got paid for it.\n\n17:36.280 --> 17:38.480\n And if the other one shipped his,\n\n17:38.480 --> 17:39.960\n I'm sure they got paid for it.\n\n17:39.960 --> 17:41.160\n How do you explain that?\n\n17:42.200 --> 17:43.400\n Well, there was no need to.\n\n17:43.400 --> 17:44.640\n The money was just unbelievable.\n\n17:44.640 --> 17:47.920\n You think about 500 kilos in the plane\n\n17:47.920 --> 17:51.760\n at $50,000 a kilo at the time.\n\n17:53.760 --> 17:55.760\n And they paid $5,000 to ship it.\n\n17:57.440 --> 18:00.560\n And they made 5,000 without even touching it.\n\n18:00.560 --> 18:03.920\n They just had somebody to load it on through the airplane.\n\n18:03.920 --> 18:05.640\n I gave it to their man in Miami.\n\n18:05.640 --> 18:07.080\n They gave it to whoever it belonged to\n\n18:07.080 --> 18:10.920\n by the marks on the duffel bags.\n\n18:10.920 --> 18:14.160\n So they was making just untold millions.\n\n18:14.160 --> 18:16.680\n Just no reason.\n\n18:16.680 --> 18:18.400\n But greed can blind men.\n\n18:20.960 --> 18:24.640\n It's still strange to me\n\n18:24.640 --> 18:26.640\n that there was not more betrayal.\n\n18:26.640 --> 18:28.800\n It speaks to something else perhaps\n\n18:28.800 --> 18:30.160\n that's bigger than money.\n\n18:31.520 --> 18:34.240\n Maybe not.\n\n18:34.240 --> 18:36.120\n But it seems like just like in the casino,\n\n18:36.120 --> 18:40.120\n like you mentioned, we get accustomed\n\n18:40.120 --> 18:42.120\n to whatever level of money we have,\n\n18:42.120 --> 18:43.680\n we get accustomed very quickly.\n\n18:43.680 --> 18:44.640\n Yes.\n\n18:44.640 --> 18:47.240\n And then there's a tension that's natural\n\n18:47.240 --> 18:49.160\n between human beings.\n\n18:49.160 --> 18:52.640\n And when that tension combined with money,\n\n18:52.640 --> 18:54.720\n combined with power,\n\n18:54.720 --> 18:57.600\n combined with, like you mentioned, beautiful women\n\n18:57.600 --> 18:59.640\n and a bit of violence,\n\n18:59.640 --> 19:04.600\n it seems that betrayal should be commonplace.\n\n19:04.600 --> 19:05.440\n But it's not.\n\n19:05.440 --> 19:07.040\n It wasn't, not at all.\n\n19:07.040 --> 19:09.640\n Carlos later, I don't know if he betrayed anybody,\n\n19:09.640 --> 19:10.840\n but he started that.\n\n19:10.840 --> 19:13.240\n He was running cocaine through the Bahamas\n\n19:13.240 --> 19:14.200\n near the island.\n\n19:14.200 --> 19:15.040\n I didn't go.\n\n19:15.040 --> 19:17.080\n I was offered to fly with a DC3 with that,\n\n19:17.080 --> 19:18.520\n but I didn't like it.\n\n19:18.520 --> 19:22.000\n So I had my route through the old wells in Louisiana.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.440\n And so I wasn't gonna change,\n\n19:24.440 --> 19:27.200\n but he talked a lot and I don't know if he betrayed,\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:28.440\n but they didn't like him.\n\n19:28.440 --> 19:31.680\n Yeah, so as you expand,\n\n19:31.680 --> 19:35.640\n there could be tensions that lead to conflict.\n\n19:35.640 --> 19:39.360\n Columbia was, like you said, an ultra violent place.\n\n19:40.480 --> 19:41.960\n How did you survive?\n\n19:41.960 --> 19:43.440\n Who protected you?\n\n19:43.440 --> 19:44.520\n I was a hero.\n\n19:44.520 --> 19:45.560\n They liked me.\n\n19:45.560 --> 19:47.480\n I mean, I was just treated royally.\n\n19:47.480 --> 19:49.600\n All I did, I would come over El Banco.\n\n19:49.600 --> 19:52.960\n There's a radio station at the Forks of the Magdalena River.\n\n19:52.960 --> 19:57.120\n I believe it was 720, if I remember right, on the AM.\n\n19:57.120 --> 19:58.840\n And I'd fly in at 10,000 feet\n\n19:58.840 --> 20:01.440\n and I'd see below me there'd be a Cessna.\n\n20:01.440 --> 20:03.600\n And I'd wiggle my wings and he'd wiggle his\n\n20:03.600 --> 20:06.520\n and I'd fall in behind him and we might go 100, 200 miles.\n\n20:06.520 --> 20:11.520\n I'd land on some jungle strip or some banana plantation.\n\n20:11.720 --> 20:13.440\n And they'd fuel me up.\n\n20:13.440 --> 20:15.680\n I could eat steak in the night.\n\n20:15.680 --> 20:17.520\n It was just like treated royally.\n\n20:17.520 --> 20:21.000\n And I mean, take off the next morning whenever I wanted to.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.920\n It was just like that was protected.\n\n20:22.920 --> 20:25.960\n And I was honored guest.\n\n20:25.960 --> 20:27.480\n It wasn't anything like in that movie,\n\n20:27.480 --> 20:29.520\n putting a gun to your head\n\n20:29.520 --> 20:31.560\n and taking your sunglasses and betting.\n\n20:31.560 --> 20:35.120\n So one time I complained to Jorge Ochoa\n\n20:35.120 --> 20:38.360\n that the runway was pretty short that they were using.\n\n20:38.360 --> 20:39.840\n And I went back down and it looked like\n\n20:39.840 --> 20:41.000\n Los Angeles International.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.480\n They had bulldozers in there.\n\n20:42.480 --> 20:44.680\n Had that thing 5,000 feet long.\n\n20:44.680 --> 20:47.520\n Just like, just the next week it was all done.\n\n20:47.520 --> 20:50.320\n The jungle was gone and clay put up there.\n\n20:50.320 --> 20:53.240\n And all the while you were not afraid.\n\n20:53.240 --> 20:54.680\n You were treated like royalty.\n\n20:54.680 --> 20:56.440\n Yes, there I was.\n\n20:56.440 --> 20:58.680\n I was afraid when I landed in the United States.\n\n20:58.680 --> 21:01.560\n Well, maybe let's go back to the beginning.\n\n21:01.560 --> 21:04.720\n What was the first time you flew an airplane\n\n21:04.720 --> 21:06.280\n with drugs on it?\n\n21:06.280 --> 21:08.760\n Tell me the story of the first time you smuggled drugs.\n\n21:08.760 --> 21:13.720\n All right, I flew down to Jalapa, Veracruz\n\n21:13.720 --> 21:15.120\n with a Cessna 182.\n\n21:16.160 --> 21:18.680\n And we landed at the town.\n\n21:18.680 --> 21:20.760\n It was a lovely town and just an old town.\n\n21:20.760 --> 21:22.200\n Looked like Bible times.\n\n21:22.200 --> 21:24.560\n People, women were washing your clothes in the streets\n\n21:24.560 --> 21:27.720\n and with stone basins and the stream running through.\n\n21:27.720 --> 21:29.760\n I just was just dumbstruck.\n\n21:29.760 --> 21:30.840\n It was just so pretty.\n\n21:30.840 --> 21:32.960\n And I went in a church and a Catholic church\n\n21:32.960 --> 21:34.720\n and it had the stations of the cross\n\n21:34.720 --> 21:36.800\n all carved magnificent.\n\n21:36.800 --> 21:37.960\n I'd never seen that.\n\n21:37.960 --> 21:39.760\n And I come home and told Mary about that.\n\n21:39.760 --> 21:41.640\n That just almost brought tears to my eyes.\n\n21:41.640 --> 21:42.920\n It was so beautiful.\n\n21:42.920 --> 21:44.640\n And three o clock the next morning\n\n21:44.640 --> 21:47.120\n I went out to the airport and taxied down to the taxiway\n\n21:47.120 --> 21:48.800\n and there was a guard came out\n\n21:49.800 --> 21:52.240\n and wanted to know what I was doing.\n\n21:52.240 --> 21:54.720\n And I pulled out, I was on the fire department\n\n21:54.720 --> 21:56.480\n at Redondo Beach, California.\n\n21:56.480 --> 21:58.680\n So I pulled out my wallet and in it was\n\n21:58.680 --> 22:00.240\n the fire department badge.\n\n22:00.240 --> 22:02.240\n And oh, he shook my hand and was so glad.\n\n22:02.240 --> 22:05.600\n So I taxied on down there and we loaded up\n\n22:05.600 --> 22:07.560\n about 400 pounds in the plane.\n\n22:07.560 --> 22:11.400\n And came on back and I was running to headwinds\n\n22:11.400 --> 22:14.440\n more than I thought and I landed on a little strip.\n\n22:14.440 --> 22:16.400\n You're talking about on the way back?\n\n22:16.400 --> 22:17.720\n On the way back, on the way north\n\n22:17.720 --> 22:19.840\n after we loaded up early in the morning.\n\n22:19.840 --> 22:22.560\n And that's the only time I ever got vertigo.\n\n22:22.560 --> 22:25.680\n The mountains were coming down at a 30, 40 degree angle\n\n22:25.680 --> 22:28.280\n and the Milky Way was overhead.\n\n22:28.280 --> 22:29.880\n And somehow I wanted that airplane\n\n22:29.880 --> 22:31.760\n to be level with the stars.\n\n22:31.760 --> 22:35.480\n And it got me, it's a phenomenal pile of vertigo.\n\n22:35.480 --> 22:37.760\n It's the only time I ever had it was on that load.\n\n22:37.760 --> 22:40.080\n So anyway, the wind was on the nose of that system.\n\n22:40.080 --> 22:43.440\n I wasn't gonna make it to the dry lake where I had fuel.\n\n22:43.440 --> 22:44.880\n So I landed on a little bitty strip\n\n22:44.880 --> 22:46.360\n and there was a little house.\n\n22:46.360 --> 22:49.120\n It was caved in and it was a little boy named Lazarus,\n\n22:49.120 --> 22:50.840\n about six or seven years old.\n\n22:50.840 --> 22:52.680\n And he was herding some goats.\n\n22:52.680 --> 22:54.400\n So we put the marijuana in that house\n\n22:54.400 --> 22:57.280\n and the man stayed with it while I flew into some town\n\n22:57.280 --> 22:59.400\n and got fuel and came back and we sat down\n\n22:59.400 --> 23:00.640\n with the lunch that I brought back\n\n23:00.640 --> 23:02.480\n and little Lazarus sat there and ate with us\n\n23:02.480 --> 23:03.600\n and we had a good time.\n\n23:03.600 --> 23:05.160\n We loaded on back and came on home.\n\n23:05.160 --> 23:09.400\n Oh wow, I wonder where he is now.\n\n23:09.400 --> 23:12.240\n So what was it like to fly,\n\n23:12.240 --> 23:16.120\n maybe describe the details of, do you have to fly low?\n\n23:16.120 --> 23:21.120\n Is there details that are unique to this experience\n\n23:21.240 --> 23:24.480\n of flying an airplane with drugs on it, on board?\n\n23:24.480 --> 23:26.200\n All right, well, one of the mistakes\n\n23:26.200 --> 23:27.920\n that just thousands, hundreds and hundreds\n\n23:27.920 --> 23:29.160\n and thousands of pilots make,\n\n23:29.160 --> 23:30.680\n they don't stop at the border,\n\n23:30.680 --> 23:33.320\n going down and get their permit.\n\n23:33.320 --> 23:35.760\n Once you get a permit to be in Mexico,\n\n23:35.760 --> 23:37.720\n you've got it for six months.\n\n23:37.720 --> 23:39.680\n You can go anywhere, any fishing village,\n\n23:39.680 --> 23:41.680\n any little town, any little place,\n\n23:41.680 --> 23:43.320\n show them this and you're welcome.\n\n23:43.320 --> 23:46.400\n If you don't have that, you go straight to jail.\n\n23:46.400 --> 23:47.600\n So you go down there and you think,\n\n23:47.600 --> 23:49.480\n okay, they're gonna have fuel for me to come back\n\n23:49.480 --> 23:50.320\n and so forth.\n\n23:50.320 --> 23:53.480\n Oh, sorry, Senor, that had a rusty leak in it.\n\n23:53.480 --> 23:54.440\n We don't have any.\n\n23:54.440 --> 23:57.120\n Well, you better be able to go to town and get it.\n\n23:57.120 --> 23:58.680\n So that's what I did.\n\n23:58.680 --> 24:01.600\n And when I was coming back for several years,\n\n24:01.600 --> 24:06.600\n I would fly up at Mexicali and cross the border\n\n24:06.720 --> 24:08.280\n right at Calexico.\n\n24:08.280 --> 24:10.480\n I would act like I was landing on the Calexico side\n\n24:10.480 --> 24:13.280\n just after dark and then I'd zip across the border\n\n24:13.280 --> 24:14.960\n and I'd go over to the Salton Sea\n\n24:14.960 --> 24:17.320\n and go below sea level, 100 and something feet,\n\n24:17.320 --> 24:19.560\n I believe 170 feet, and come on up\n\n24:19.560 --> 24:21.800\n and go out there above Palm Springs\n\n24:21.800 --> 24:24.640\n and land at 29 Palms in the desert\n\n24:24.640 --> 24:26.600\n and put my stuff under a Joshua tree\n\n24:26.600 --> 24:28.600\n and fly into town and get my pickup\n\n24:28.600 --> 24:29.720\n and go on back out and get it.\n\n24:29.720 --> 24:31.280\n And that was fun.\n\n24:31.280 --> 24:32.800\n And then it got really dangerous.\n\n24:32.800 --> 24:36.120\n They had Operation Starlight, I believe was the name of it.\n\n24:36.120 --> 24:39.360\n And they called a lot of pilots coming across the border.\n\n24:39.360 --> 24:40.360\n So I changed it.\n\n24:40.360 --> 24:42.080\n And by that time I was flying bigger planes.\n\n24:42.080 --> 24:43.480\n I was flying Beach 18s.\n\n24:44.480 --> 24:47.760\n And I would refuel in Mulahe halfway down\n\n24:47.760 --> 24:50.480\n on the Baja Peninsula.\n\n24:50.480 --> 24:52.440\n And then over in the middle,\n\n24:52.440 --> 24:55.360\n 20 miles from the nearest road was a goat ranch\n\n24:55.360 --> 24:57.360\n where they milked goats and made cheese.\n\n24:58.520 --> 25:00.400\n And I would go there and unload the load\n\n25:00.400 --> 25:02.960\n coming up out of anywhere in Southern Mexico.\n\n25:02.960 --> 25:05.360\n And I would land there and a guy named Juan\n\n25:05.360 --> 25:09.360\n would put the marijuana under the trees\n\n25:09.360 --> 25:11.960\n and I'd fly into Mulahe and they'd wash my plane\n\n25:11.960 --> 25:15.200\n and gas it up and I'd eat a lunch\n\n25:15.200 --> 25:18.400\n and rent a room for a few hours and take a nap and a shower\n\n25:18.400 --> 25:20.400\n and then go back in the afternoon and fill up.\n\n25:20.400 --> 25:23.280\n And then I would go Northwest out of there\n\n25:23.280 --> 25:27.000\n and fly 200 miles off the coast of the island of Guadalupe.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.720\n And from there I would fly on a more Northwestern heading\n\n25:29.720 --> 25:32.680\n about 300 miles out over the Pacific.\n\n25:32.680 --> 25:35.360\n And then I would come in behind the Santa Barbara Islands\n\n25:35.360 --> 25:38.880\n down low and then I'd come up and go out in the desert land.\n\n25:38.880 --> 25:42.240\n And I did that for the rest of their marijuana trips.\n\n25:44.720 --> 25:49.040\n What was the hardest part about flying those routes?\n\n25:49.040 --> 25:51.360\n The hardest part was getting good in marijuana.\n\n25:52.920 --> 25:54.640\n So the hardest part isn't the flying.\n\n25:54.640 --> 25:55.480\n No, it's the flying.\n\n25:55.480 --> 25:57.040\n It's just like driving your car down.\n\n25:57.040 --> 25:59.560\n But then I had people that would bring me on strips\n\n25:59.560 --> 26:02.120\n that were just unworthy of an airplane.\n\n26:02.120 --> 26:07.120\n Like when I'd land on a highway and in the rainy season,\n\n26:07.120 --> 26:08.400\n I would come back to land again\n\n26:08.400 --> 26:10.360\n and the guy wouldn't think about it.\n\n26:10.360 --> 26:12.080\n And he'd have like little hills on both sides\n\n26:12.080 --> 26:14.280\n and the wings were out there.\n\n26:14.280 --> 26:16.240\n Well, the grass and the weeds would grow up\n\n26:16.240 --> 26:18.800\n and it sounded like, I mean,\n\n26:18.800 --> 26:20.200\n it sounded like tearing the airplane apart\n\n26:20.200 --> 26:21.320\n when those wings hit.\n\n26:21.320 --> 26:24.600\n Mowing the grass down both shoulders of the airplane.\n\n26:24.600 --> 26:26.800\n The weeds would grow up high in the tropics.\n\n26:26.800 --> 26:28.200\n So some of that stuff was bad.\n\n26:28.200 --> 26:31.320\n And oh, getting bad gasoline and telling me\n\n26:31.320 --> 26:32.840\n that land here in the night\n\n26:32.840 --> 26:35.880\n and knock the wheels off when you land.\n\n26:35.880 --> 26:38.240\n Oh, you should have landed a little further up here,\n\n26:38.240 --> 26:42.120\n Senor, they ditched down, that sort of thing.\n\n26:42.120 --> 26:43.960\n What was it like landing on a highway\n\n26:43.960 --> 26:46.440\n and when did you have to land on the highway?\n\n26:46.440 --> 26:49.560\n I landed on the highway most of my life, most of the times.\n\n26:49.560 --> 26:51.800\n In Mexico, first time I went down,\n\n26:51.800 --> 26:54.080\n there was a place called Pichalingi\n\n26:54.080 --> 26:56.560\n and it had a 900 foot strip.\n\n26:56.560 --> 27:00.200\n And I would fly down and I'd carry gasoline wing with me\n\n27:00.200 --> 27:03.400\n and Maury and I would go to the grocery store\n\n27:03.400 --> 27:05.160\n and buy all kinds of little goodies and candies\n\n27:05.160 --> 27:07.080\n and toys to bring to the children.\n\n27:07.080 --> 27:12.080\n And that sand strip in the bend of a river\n\n27:13.440 --> 27:15.320\n was just too short to take off with a load.\n\n27:15.320 --> 27:17.200\n So there was a young man there named Pedro,\n\n27:17.200 --> 27:20.040\n must not weigh much over 100, maybe 120 pounds.\n\n27:20.040 --> 27:22.400\n And he'd get in a plane with me\n\n27:22.400 --> 27:27.400\n and he'd direct me 20, 30, 40 miles away to a highway.\n\n27:27.400 --> 27:30.880\n And the people walk in and the people would pull out\n\n27:30.880 --> 27:32.840\n in a two ton truck with a machine gun on it\n\n27:32.840 --> 27:35.960\n and a bunch of guys with arms with us\n\n27:35.960 --> 27:37.240\n and they'd block the road\n\n27:37.240 --> 27:39.400\n and then another one would block it up about a mile away.\n\n27:39.400 --> 27:40.840\n And I'd land right over that truck\n\n27:40.840 --> 27:43.520\n and they'd load me up and it looked like a bucket brigade\n\n27:43.520 --> 27:44.560\n with the marijuana coming.\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:45.960\n I'd shake hands with all of them\n\n27:45.960 --> 27:48.240\n and I'd take off right over the other trucks.\n\n27:48.240 --> 27:51.240\n And sometimes maybe 20, 30, 40 cars lined up.\n\n27:51.240 --> 27:54.560\n One time I remember a patrol car, a highway patrol car,\n\n27:55.440 --> 27:57.960\n he didn't have his lights on, took off right over him.\n\n27:57.960 --> 28:00.960\n And then when I started flying to Louisiana,\n\n28:00.960 --> 28:02.840\n the bridge over the Mississippi River,\n\n28:02.840 --> 28:04.920\n there were several contractors that went broke\n\n28:04.920 --> 28:07.440\n and that thing was out for years.\n\n28:07.440 --> 28:08.920\n And about five miles from the river\n\n28:08.920 --> 28:11.560\n was flashing red lights and a detour.\n\n28:12.960 --> 28:14.680\n And then they swamp on both sides of it\n\n28:14.680 --> 28:17.280\n and the middle of it we're growing up with 20 feet trees\n\n28:17.280 --> 28:20.720\n and that was like an international runway\n\n28:20.720 --> 28:22.680\n from anywhere in the world.\n\n28:22.680 --> 28:25.080\n So I landed on that and over and over those red lights\n\n28:25.080 --> 28:26.200\n just like the end of a runway.\n\n28:26.200 --> 28:28.360\n And then the next morning we'd go out there\n\n28:28.360 --> 28:31.800\n and scrub the marks off the highway where I'd landed\n\n28:31.800 --> 28:33.320\n before daylight.\n\n28:33.320 --> 28:34.560\n Wow.\n\n28:34.560 --> 28:38.000\n Let's go to somebody you've known well,\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.720\n somebody who's also a drug smuggler is Barry Seal.\n\n28:42.840 --> 28:44.720\n Who is Barry Seal?\n\n28:44.720 --> 28:45.800\n How did you meet him?\n\n28:45.800 --> 28:47.400\n Barry Seal is a friend of mine.\n\n28:50.280 --> 28:53.160\n Murray and I and the children went down in Honduras\n\n28:53.160 --> 28:57.040\n and we went up Lake Azul, I believe it was,\n\n28:57.040 --> 28:58.720\n and we were looking at a ranch to buy.\n\n28:58.720 --> 29:00.280\n I was looking for something in Central America\n\n29:00.280 --> 29:03.240\n where I'd have a halfway place.\n\n29:03.240 --> 29:04.200\n Oh, it was lovely.\n\n29:04.200 --> 29:06.680\n We stayed up there for some days and our clothes got muddy\n\n29:06.680 --> 29:08.720\n and we went in the river and all kinds of things.\n\n29:08.720 --> 29:10.920\n So we got to San Pedro Sula\n\n29:10.920 --> 29:12.920\n and we was going back to New Orleans.\n\n29:13.840 --> 29:17.520\n So we went to the cleaners to get our clothes\n\n29:17.520 --> 29:19.680\n and most all of them was in there.\n\n29:19.680 --> 29:22.440\n And they go, oh, Senor, they'll be ready tomorrow morning.\n\n29:22.440 --> 29:23.320\n We're not ready now.\n\n29:23.320 --> 29:27.400\n Well, the plane leaves at nine o clock or whatever.\n\n29:27.400 --> 29:30.680\n So I told Murray for her and the children\n\n29:30.680 --> 29:32.600\n to go into the airport because it'd be easier\n\n29:32.600 --> 29:35.280\n for one just on a standby flight.\n\n29:35.280 --> 29:39.400\n So I went to the laundromat for the clothes\n\n29:39.400 --> 29:41.440\n and they were ready and there was a pile of them.\n\n29:41.440 --> 29:43.160\n And I put them on my back and got in a taxi\n\n29:43.160 --> 29:44.800\n and the old taxi would drive him with it\n\n29:44.800 --> 29:46.480\n and I'd give him a hundred dollars to go faster\n\n29:46.480 --> 29:48.600\n and he just blew his horn more rapid.\n\n29:48.600 --> 29:53.000\n So finally we got to the airport\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.320\n and I jumped out and ran around on the tarmac\n\n29:55.320 --> 29:59.600\n and here's a brand new 727 taxiing out.\n\n29:59.600 --> 30:01.160\n Oh no.\n\n30:01.160 --> 30:04.040\n So I'm waving to the pilot and he's a young fella.\n\n30:04.040 --> 30:05.800\n He waves back.\n\n30:05.800 --> 30:07.520\n Then I see Murray's face in the cockpit\n\n30:07.520 --> 30:09.960\n and the nose goes down where he puts on brakes\n\n30:09.960 --> 30:12.560\n and he laughs and he puts some stairwell out.\n\n30:12.560 --> 30:14.800\n And I run for the stairwell and he pulls it back up\n\n30:14.800 --> 30:16.680\n and goes like a hitchhiker going to pick you up\n\n30:16.680 --> 30:17.640\n and go again.\n\n30:18.880 --> 30:21.680\n Then he put it out and I got on and the whole crowd clapped\n\n30:21.680 --> 30:23.960\n and I'm coming home with that load of clothes.\n\n30:26.240 --> 30:29.520\n So I go way down in the middle and the plane's full\n\n30:29.520 --> 30:32.400\n and Miriam, my daughter, was about nine years old then\n\n30:32.400 --> 30:33.880\n and she was sitting in the middle\n\n30:33.880 --> 30:35.680\n and by the window was Barry Seal.\n\n30:35.680 --> 30:36.680\n Of course I didn't know it.\n\n30:36.680 --> 30:39.960\n And I sat in the middle and we took off\n\n30:39.960 --> 30:42.160\n and the wheels come up with clunk\n\n30:42.160 --> 30:43.840\n and then I got up about 5,000 feet\n\n30:43.840 --> 30:45.680\n and we had a little clunk and she said,\n\n30:45.680 --> 30:46.520\n what was that, daddy?\n\n30:46.520 --> 30:49.160\n And I said, he just turned on his autopilot.\n\n30:49.160 --> 30:51.000\n And that fella reached over and I looked at him.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:55.000\n I said, he looks like CIA or FBI, something.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.440\n He ain't supposed to be here.\n\n30:56.440 --> 30:59.320\n Clear blue eyes, gentleman looking man.\n\n30:59.320 --> 31:01.880\n And he said, you fly these things?\n\n31:01.880 --> 31:03.240\n I said, I got a few hours, mister.\n\n31:03.240 --> 31:05.040\n He said, I'll fly them too or something.\n\n31:05.040 --> 31:06.240\n And he said, my name's Barry Seal.\n\n31:06.240 --> 31:08.480\n And he reached over Miriam and shook hands\n\n31:08.480 --> 31:11.800\n and we got to talking and I thought,\n\n31:11.800 --> 31:13.520\n there's no choice of seats on this.\n\n31:13.520 --> 31:16.840\n It's just open seating so I don't believe him one bit.\n\n31:18.560 --> 31:19.600\n And he started talking about,\n\n31:19.600 --> 31:21.200\n he just got out of jail that morning.\n\n31:21.200 --> 31:22.360\n Just got out of prison.\n\n31:23.320 --> 31:24.400\n And I said, uh huh.\n\n31:26.560 --> 31:28.280\n And he told me that he'd been a pilot\n\n31:28.280 --> 31:31.200\n with the TWA and this and other.\n\n31:31.200 --> 31:33.880\n And told me what he was for.\n\n31:33.880 --> 31:35.480\n So we had a nice conversation\n\n31:35.480 --> 31:37.240\n for a couple hours to New Orleans.\n\n31:37.240 --> 31:39.200\n I didn't believe him.\n\n31:39.200 --> 31:40.680\n So he got off in front of us\n\n31:40.680 --> 31:44.080\n and what a crowd of people to meet him.\n\n31:44.080 --> 31:46.840\n An old mother and a wife and little children\n\n31:46.840 --> 31:49.200\n hanging on to him, crying and hugging and kissing him.\n\n31:49.200 --> 31:51.160\n I said, he was telling the truth.\n\n31:53.440 --> 31:56.160\n So I reached over and gave him a little piece of paper.\n\n31:56.160 --> 31:57.880\n I had Murray to write it out with our address.\n\n31:57.880 --> 32:00.040\n I said, Barry, I might have some work for you.\n\n32:00.040 --> 32:00.880\n Come on out.\n\n32:00.880 --> 32:01.720\n What was he in jail for?\n\n32:01.720 --> 32:04.760\n He got caught with 100 kilos of cocaine in a small plane.\n\n32:05.840 --> 32:07.800\n And so he served a year.\n\n32:07.800 --> 32:10.040\n And that was from Colombia?\n\n32:10.040 --> 32:11.200\n I don't know where it come from.\n\n32:11.200 --> 32:14.120\n He got caught in Honduras, probably refueling.\n\n32:14.120 --> 32:17.360\n But he'd been in prison down there before\n\n32:17.360 --> 32:21.440\n for bringing explosives to the Cuban Contras.\n\n32:21.440 --> 32:23.640\n And he lost his job with the airlines.\n\n32:23.640 --> 32:25.720\n And then later on, I found out he was ex CIA\n\n32:25.720 --> 32:27.720\n and George Bush Sr.'s protege\n\n32:27.720 --> 32:32.320\n and had a thousand parachute jumps and was there.\n\n32:32.320 --> 32:33.680\n He was a hot shot model.\n\n32:34.720 --> 32:37.360\n There's a million questions I wanna ask here.\n\n32:37.360 --> 32:41.160\n But maybe can we linger on a little bit longer?\n\n32:41.160 --> 32:43.200\n What was your relationship with him like?\n\n32:44.880 --> 32:47.000\n You were a drug smuggler.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.440\n He's a drug smuggler.\n\n32:50.400 --> 32:53.720\n Your friends, how often do you guys talk?\n\n32:53.720 --> 32:55.280\n How often do you work together?\n\n32:56.120 --> 32:58.200\n What was the relationship like?\n\n32:58.200 --> 33:01.480\n Well, I'll back up and finish where I started off there.\n\n33:01.480 --> 33:02.720\n I gave him the things, Barry,\n\n33:02.720 --> 33:03.640\n I may have some work for you.\n\n33:03.640 --> 33:05.280\n I know I got some work for you.\n\n33:05.280 --> 33:08.600\n And I said, come out to Santa Barbara.\n\n33:08.600 --> 33:10.760\n And so I don't know, a week or two later,\n\n33:10.760 --> 33:12.600\n he flew out and went to our house\n\n33:12.600 --> 33:14.360\n and stayed with us a couple of days.\n\n33:14.360 --> 33:18.440\n And I had a almost brand new Aero Commander 690B.\n\n33:18.440 --> 33:20.440\n That thing with turbo prop and it was hot.\n\n33:20.440 --> 33:22.640\n It was the hottest thing I'd ever had.\n\n33:22.640 --> 33:25.320\n So I said, let's go Barry, let's see what you can do.\n\n33:26.400 --> 33:27.920\n So I'm sorry I said that.\n\n33:27.920 --> 33:30.160\n We got about 10,000 feet.\n\n33:30.160 --> 33:32.200\n And he was like one of them blue angel pilots.\n\n33:32.200 --> 33:34.080\n He rung that thing out.\n\n33:34.080 --> 33:35.000\n And I said, that's enough.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:38.160\n And then he did a falling leaf.\n\n33:38.160 --> 33:39.280\n That's where you cut the engines\n\n33:39.280 --> 33:41.480\n and the plane falls from side to side.\n\n33:41.480 --> 33:43.760\n And I saw Bob Hoover do that in the air show once.\n\n33:43.760 --> 33:45.640\n And that's the only person I ever saw do it.\n\n33:45.640 --> 33:49.360\n And I was, my hands was white knuckle hanging onto the seat.\n\n33:49.360 --> 33:50.680\n You shut off the engine?\n\n33:50.680 --> 33:51.840\n Yeah, he shut off the engines\n\n33:51.840 --> 33:54.640\n and landed flying side by side like this.\n\n33:54.640 --> 33:55.800\n How do you explain that?\n\n33:55.800 --> 33:58.360\n Was he just a wild man\n\n33:58.360 --> 34:00.360\n or was he sufficiently skilled to work?\n\n34:00.360 --> 34:01.960\n He was sufficiently skilled.\n\n34:01.960 --> 34:02.920\n Absolutely.\n\n34:02.920 --> 34:05.080\n He knew what he was doing.\n\n34:05.080 --> 34:06.680\n I can get a plane from one spot to another\n\n34:06.680 --> 34:08.160\n and I guess I'm known as a good pilot,\n\n34:08.160 --> 34:10.280\n but that guy, it was an aerobatic.\n\n34:10.280 --> 34:15.120\n So anyway, he stayed with us a couple of days.\n\n34:15.120 --> 34:18.520\n And then I told him, I said, this plane needs tanking.\n\n34:18.520 --> 34:20.200\n And I said, I got some work down in Columbia.\n\n34:20.200 --> 34:21.960\n It needs to come back to Louisiana.\n\n34:21.960 --> 34:23.880\n And I need 2,500 mile range.\n\n34:23.880 --> 34:25.840\n He said, I got somebody in Mena, Arkansas\n\n34:25.840 --> 34:27.480\n to do that and keep their mouth shut.\n\n34:27.480 --> 34:30.560\n So I gave him $10,000 and he flew away.\n\n34:30.560 --> 34:32.560\n And in a few days he called me and says,\n\n34:32.560 --> 34:35.560\n come to my house in Baton Rouge.\n\n34:35.560 --> 34:37.440\n So I went out to his house in Baton Rouge\n\n34:37.440 --> 34:39.400\n and I stayed with him for a few days.\n\n34:39.400 --> 34:40.960\n And that plane was tanked.\n\n34:40.960 --> 34:43.520\n I mean, beautiful from stem to stern.\n\n34:43.520 --> 34:47.280\n I could went from Bolivia to Canada with it.\n\n34:47.280 --> 34:51.400\n So then I hired him to fly.\n\n34:51.400 --> 34:52.760\n And he was funny.\n\n34:52.760 --> 34:54.440\n I paid him a million dollars a trip.\n\n34:54.440 --> 34:57.560\n I paid him $2,000 a kilo, so about a million dollar trip.\n\n34:57.560 --> 35:01.600\n And I didn't get paid until the people received it.\n\n35:01.600 --> 35:04.000\n They had to ship it to Chicago and New York\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.120\n and then the money come back.\n\n35:05.120 --> 35:07.880\n So it was a couple of two or three weeks pipeline.\n\n35:07.880 --> 35:10.840\n Well, I always had to pay him before he'd go again.\n\n35:10.840 --> 35:12.920\n I mean, and he barely ache.\n\n35:12.920 --> 35:15.360\n I mean, he had moaning room.\n\n35:15.360 --> 35:19.920\n So one time I gave him a million dollars\n\n35:19.920 --> 35:21.600\n and I put it in a box real nice.\n\n35:21.600 --> 35:23.960\n So how big is a box that contains a million dollars?\n\n35:23.960 --> 35:25.240\n So we're talking about a hundred dollar bills?\n\n35:25.240 --> 35:26.480\n A hundred dollar bill, it's not very big.\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:28.280\n You can put it in a large briefcase.\n\n35:29.480 --> 35:31.680\n It weighs exactly 10 kilos.\n\n35:31.680 --> 35:34.840\n Each bill weighs a gram, so you can weigh your money\n\n35:34.840 --> 35:36.720\n and almost get it exactly right.\n\n35:36.720 --> 35:38.680\n 20 something pounds is a million dollars.\n\n35:38.680 --> 35:39.800\n 22 pounds.\n\n35:39.800 --> 35:40.920\n 22 pounds.\n\n35:40.920 --> 35:42.200\n A hundred dollar bills.\n\n35:42.200 --> 35:45.960\n But in one dollar bills, it's one ton, 2,200 pounds.\n\n35:48.080 --> 35:49.400\n We didn't even accept them.\n\n35:49.400 --> 35:51.200\n Were you the one that introduced Barry Seal\n\n35:51.200 --> 35:53.160\n to Pablo Escobar?\n\n35:53.160 --> 35:55.960\n No, I didn't introduce him at all.\n\n35:55.960 --> 36:00.240\n And our deal was that you don't meet my people.\n\n36:00.240 --> 36:02.280\n I mean, we just kind of crossed your working for me\n\n36:02.280 --> 36:03.480\n to fly the airplanes.\n\n36:03.480 --> 36:05.240\n So he wanted these Panther conversions\n\n36:05.240 --> 36:09.640\n that cost $400,000 each with a storm scope and radar.\n\n36:09.640 --> 36:11.440\n I bought anything you want.\n\n36:11.440 --> 36:12.840\n What's that mean, sorry to interrupt,\n\n36:12.840 --> 36:14.440\n Panther conversions?\n\n36:14.440 --> 36:18.280\n Panther conversion was, these people called Panther,\n\n36:18.280 --> 36:20.960\n they took everything out from the firewall,\n\n36:20.960 --> 36:22.880\n the instruments and all and converted them\n\n36:22.880 --> 36:25.600\n and put Q tip propellers on them full bladed\n\n36:25.600 --> 36:28.680\n and you very quiet and the CIA developed those\n\n36:28.680 --> 36:31.880\n in Southeast Asia for running behind the lines.\n\n36:31.880 --> 36:33.560\n And that's where Barry had flown those things\n\n36:33.560 --> 36:35.040\n so he knew about them.\n\n36:35.040 --> 36:38.280\n So that's what he wanted and that's what we got him.\n\n36:38.280 --> 36:39.880\n How does that connect to Pablo?\n\n36:39.880 --> 36:42.840\n And so he worked for you and you got those upgrades.\n\n36:42.840 --> 36:44.600\n I think he flew about 30 loads for me\n\n36:44.600 --> 36:48.840\n and then I got arrested and was for everything in the world.\n\n36:48.840 --> 36:51.080\n Got 35 years sentence.\n\n36:51.080 --> 36:52.400\n But let me back up a little bit.\n\n36:52.400 --> 36:55.880\n Barry was our friend.\n\n36:55.880 --> 36:57.360\n Mari and I are both friends.\n\n36:57.360 --> 37:02.360\n We should pause real quick and say Mari is your wife\n\n37:02.360 --> 37:07.360\n and hopefully we'll convince her to join us in a little bit.\n\n37:07.880 --> 37:11.240\n She's the love of your life and sort of she weaves in\n\n37:11.240 --> 37:13.520\n and out of many of these stories that you tell.\n\n37:13.520 --> 37:15.280\n Yes, she was there.\n\n37:15.280 --> 37:16.640\n She was behind the scenes.\n\n37:16.640 --> 37:18.920\n But I kept her out of it completely.\n\n37:18.920 --> 37:21.920\n And then also you mentioned Mariam as your daughter.\n\n37:21.920 --> 37:25.080\n Yes, our son was a baby.\n\n37:25.080 --> 37:27.440\n And I remember we went out to a festival,\n\n37:27.440 --> 37:29.640\n was my favorite restaurant in Carl Gables.\n\n37:29.640 --> 37:31.600\n Oh God, it was good.\n\n37:31.600 --> 37:32.840\n And Barry knew about it.\n\n37:32.840 --> 37:34.160\n Anyhow, we went out to dinner\n\n37:34.160 --> 37:38.160\n and so we came back and there was no rooms.\n\n37:38.160 --> 37:40.480\n So Barry will spend the night with us.\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:42.040\n So he goes to our hotel room with us\n\n37:42.040 --> 37:45.680\n and we got two big beds in the Omni Hotel\n\n37:45.680 --> 37:47.000\n and he lays over there and he gets down\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.600\n to his stripy undershorts and his T shirt\n\n37:49.600 --> 37:51.840\n and he puts the baby up on his belly\n\n37:51.840 --> 37:52.800\n and gives him the bottle and said,\n\n37:52.800 --> 37:54.520\n mm, ain't that good, Red?\n\n37:54.520 --> 37:55.360\n Oh my, my.\n\n37:55.360 --> 37:56.720\n And he just feeds the baby.\n\n37:56.720 --> 38:00.160\n We laugh and talk and that's how close we were\n\n38:00.160 --> 38:03.240\n that we could all stay in a hotel room together.\n\n38:03.240 --> 38:04.760\n And would you say he's a good man?\n\n38:04.760 --> 38:06.440\n Oh, wonderful man.\n\n38:06.440 --> 38:09.160\n A gentleman, Southern gentleman.\n\n38:09.160 --> 38:11.800\n Just looked after his mother, his family,\n\n38:11.800 --> 38:14.240\n everybody around him, everybody loved Barry.\n\n38:14.240 --> 38:18.280\n He just had a little smile on his face always.\n\n38:18.280 --> 38:21.480\n So you got arrested and then what happened to Barry?\n\n38:21.480 --> 38:26.280\n Well, Barry knew the people that unloaded.\n\n38:26.280 --> 38:28.400\n Of course he sent the cars down and all that.\n\n38:28.400 --> 38:31.600\n So he met the unloader, a guy named Lito,\n\n38:31.600 --> 38:35.200\n Luis Carlos Bustamante of Venezuelan.\n\n38:35.200 --> 38:37.320\n So he just kept on flying.\n\n38:37.320 --> 38:40.240\n But he, I believe he had three of my airplanes\n\n38:40.240 --> 38:42.760\n at $400,000 a piece and they owed me some money.\n\n38:42.760 --> 38:45.320\n Well, he collected a lot of that and gave Marie the money\n\n38:45.320 --> 38:48.160\n and put it in his safe and took her to his house\n\n38:48.160 --> 38:50.600\n and all after I got arrested and sent a lawyer in.\n\n38:50.600 --> 38:54.000\n He got me the best lawyer in the country, Albert Krieger.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:56.720\n He was head of the defense team for all of America.\n\n38:56.720 --> 38:58.780\n Wonderful man.\n\n38:58.780 --> 39:03.040\n Can you tell the story of the months\n\n39:03.040 --> 39:05.880\n that led up to Barry's assassination?\n\n39:05.880 --> 39:10.000\n What did you know, what did you sense, what did you think?\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:12.200\n Okay, when I got out of prison, I hadn't been out long.\n\n39:12.200 --> 39:16.680\n I was eating breakfast and there was Ronald Reagan's face\n\n39:16.680 --> 39:18.360\n right in the television.\n\n39:18.360 --> 39:21.240\n We have absolute proof that the communist\n\n39:21.240 --> 39:24.700\n Sandinista government is in the cocaine running business.\n\n39:24.700 --> 39:29.300\n And there was that fat lady, the C126 on the runway\n\n39:29.300 --> 39:33.800\n with the belly down and I thought, oh God, he had done it.\n\n39:34.660 --> 39:37.600\n So I had heard that Barry might've been working with him.\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:39.400\n So it wasn't long before.\n\n39:39.400 --> 39:40.220\n Working with?\n\n39:40.220 --> 39:44.720\n With the DEA or whoever, he was no longer on our side.\n\n39:45.720 --> 39:48.120\n So can you clarify how you got that\n\n39:48.120 --> 39:52.000\n from the Reagan making a statement about we've heard.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\n Okay, there was his plane.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:57.120\n There was Barry's plane and okay, on the way north,\n\n39:57.120 --> 40:00.080\n we could stop in Nicaragua and land on a military base\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:03.560\n or on a base that they used as crop dusters and all\n\n40:03.560 --> 40:06.600\n and refuel and so that shortened our trip.\n\n40:06.600 --> 40:08.400\n We'd go further into the jungle and come up\n\n40:08.400 --> 40:10.680\n and that was what Pablo Escobar and Ochoa and them\n\n40:10.680 --> 40:15.520\n and they was associates with the people in Nicaragua.\n\n40:15.520 --> 40:19.200\n So Barry was, if that plane was there,\n\n40:19.200 --> 40:22.800\n that means Barry was feeding the DEA information.\n\n40:22.800 --> 40:24.400\n He was working with them at that time.\n\n40:24.400 --> 40:25.720\n But let me back up a little bit.\n\n40:25.720 --> 40:28.140\n When I was flying and I told Barry,\n\n40:28.140 --> 40:31.680\n we would refuel in Trange Airplane,\n\n40:31.680 --> 40:35.040\n the loads in Belize where I had a spot up there\n\n40:35.040 --> 40:37.920\n and then that's when they told me\n\n40:37.920 --> 40:42.640\n we can refuel in Nicaragua and then you fly all the way\n\n40:42.640 --> 40:44.480\n and Barry couldn't believe it.\n\n40:44.480 --> 40:46.120\n He says, all right, but I wanted you to land.\n\n40:46.120 --> 40:49.420\n I had a place in Louisiana for $10,000\n\n40:49.420 --> 40:53.000\n that I could unload and the sheriff and all them was paid off.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.200\n And he said, no, no, no.\n\n40:56.280 --> 40:58.560\n I can't get caught in Meena, Arkansas.\n\n40:58.560 --> 41:00.320\n I said, what do you mean you can't get caught\n\n41:00.320 --> 41:01.160\n in Meena, Arkansas?\n\n41:01.160 --> 41:02.960\n You get caught anywhere.\n\n41:02.960 --> 41:06.760\n He said, I can't, but it's gonna cost you $50,000\n\n41:06.760 --> 41:08.600\n every time my wheels touch the ground.\n\n41:09.760 --> 41:11.960\n Why, can you explain why he can't get caught\n\n41:11.960 --> 41:12.800\n in Meena, Arkansas?\n\n41:12.800 --> 41:15.860\n He said he was hooked up with him at the very top\n\n41:15.860 --> 41:17.840\n and he even said, I'm gonna have dinner\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:19.720\n with the governor tonight.\n\n41:19.720 --> 41:21.280\n That's at that time.\n\n41:21.280 --> 41:22.120\n Meena, Arkansas.\n\n41:22.120 --> 41:23.480\n Mr. Bill Clinton.\n\n41:23.480 --> 41:25.040\n Undoubtedly.\n\n41:25.040 --> 41:26.640\n And it's like, did Bill Clinton,\n\n41:26.640 --> 41:27.800\n did you give him any money?\n\n41:27.800 --> 41:30.400\n And I said, no, I never gave the man any money,\n\n41:30.400 --> 41:31.640\n but it was like the money that I had\n\n41:31.640 --> 41:32.960\n that went to Grand Cayman Islands\n\n41:32.960 --> 41:35.960\n and I told my lawyer, I said, I never touched that money.\n\n41:35.960 --> 41:38.880\n He said, you don't have to fondle it to be guilty.\n\n41:38.880 --> 41:40.040\n So.\n\n41:40.040 --> 41:43.480\n So what, I mean, there's a lot of conspiracy theories\n\n41:43.480 --> 41:46.480\n around the relationship between Barry Seal and the Clintons.\n\n41:46.480 --> 41:47.400\n Absolutely.\n\n41:47.400 --> 41:50.480\n What evidence do we have?\n\n41:50.480 --> 41:53.600\n What would you say from your best understanding\n\n41:55.480 --> 41:57.000\n of what was the relationship\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.520\n between Bill Clinton and Barry Seal?\n\n41:59.520 --> 42:02.600\n Barry said, and he knew that he couldn't get caught\n\n42:02.600 --> 42:04.520\n in Meena, Arkansas.\n\n42:04.520 --> 42:05.960\n And when that movie was gonna come out,\n\n42:05.960 --> 42:09.800\n be called Meena, somebody stopped it.\n\n42:09.800 --> 42:11.360\n I mean, they stopped it dead in the tracks\n\n42:11.360 --> 42:14.120\n for two or three years and the producer even quit.\n\n42:14.120 --> 42:16.320\n You mean the American Made with Tom Cruise movie?\n\n42:16.320 --> 42:17.160\n It wasn't American.\n\n42:17.160 --> 42:18.080\n It was gonna be called Meena?\n\n42:18.080 --> 42:20.760\n It's the name that was written and produced in Meena.\n\n42:21.680 --> 42:25.160\n And waiting on Hillary to be elected,\n\n42:25.160 --> 42:27.920\n they would not let that movie out.\n\n42:27.920 --> 42:30.080\n And that movie was changed drastically.\n\n42:30.080 --> 42:31.560\n But to push back on that,\n\n42:31.560 --> 42:33.320\n that doesn't mean there's truth there.\n\n42:33.320 --> 42:35.840\n That means they were worried about\n\n42:35.840 --> 42:39.440\n the power of the conspiracy theory, which stuck.\n\n42:39.440 --> 42:40.280\n Exactly.\n\n42:40.280 --> 42:41.640\n But I don't know.\n\n42:41.640 --> 42:44.600\n I mean, you know, some conspiracy theories,\n\n42:44.600 --> 42:47.320\n just because they're popular doesn't mean they're true.\n\n42:47.320 --> 42:51.160\n And ones that, but it also doesn't mean they're not true.\n\n42:51.160 --> 42:53.080\n And there's ones that are not very popular\n\n42:53.080 --> 42:54.080\n that could be true.\n\n42:54.080 --> 42:56.920\n But that one really stuck.\n\n42:58.320 --> 43:00.120\n I mean, what's your sense?\n\n43:00.120 --> 43:01.680\n Well, I paid one and a half million dollars\n\n43:01.680 --> 43:03.800\n for Barry to land at Meena, Arkansas.\n\n43:03.800 --> 43:07.200\n So I was pretty well assured that he couldn't get caught.\n\n43:08.840 --> 43:10.840\n And I said, well, I can't get caught in Columbia.\n\n43:10.840 --> 43:12.200\n We can't get caught in Nicaragua.\n\n43:12.200 --> 43:14.680\n I guess we got a license.\n\n43:14.680 --> 43:15.520\n So we went for it.\n\n43:15.520 --> 43:17.240\n Oh, so when you say I can't get caught,\n\n43:17.240 --> 43:19.680\n just to clarify, there's a sense\n\n43:19.680 --> 43:22.000\n where this is a safe place to land.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:23.920\n Yes, like completely safe.\n\n43:23.920 --> 43:25.360\n So you don't think he was referring\n\n43:25.360 --> 43:28.560\n to some kind of, you know,\n\n43:29.640 --> 43:33.480\n like my grandfather who fought in World War II\n\n43:33.480 --> 43:36.200\n would talk about bullets can't hit him.\n\n43:36.200 --> 43:39.320\n So it's almost like believing.\n\n43:39.320 --> 43:41.800\n He was taking that $50,000 and giving it to somebody.\n\n43:41.800 --> 43:43.520\n And Barry was honest.\n\n43:43.520 --> 43:45.120\n So he wasn't just taking it from me\n\n43:45.120 --> 43:46.520\n because he was making a million dollars.\n\n43:46.520 --> 43:48.080\n He didn't care for the $50,000.\n\n43:49.040 --> 43:52.360\n Oh man, taking the story forward,\n\n43:53.440 --> 43:55.680\n the months leading up to his assassination,\n\n43:55.680 --> 44:00.680\n what would you understand why he was assassinated?\n\n44:01.040 --> 44:02.760\n Who were the players involved?\n\n44:04.880 --> 44:06.480\n Maybe could you have stopped it?\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.560\n Well, I'll tell you, after I saw Reagan's face\n\n44:10.560 --> 44:13.920\n on the television saying we have the absolute proof,\n\n44:13.920 --> 44:15.960\n the phone rang and it was Barry.\n\n44:15.960 --> 44:18.640\n I hadn't heard from him in a couple of years.\n\n44:18.640 --> 44:20.560\n He said, I'm coming out tonight, Roger.\n\n44:21.800 --> 44:22.760\n And I, oh boy.\n\n44:23.720 --> 44:26.160\n So he came out and he said,\n\n44:26.160 --> 44:28.240\n I'll meet you in this French restaurant.\n\n44:28.240 --> 44:30.120\n I don't even know it in Santa Barbara.\n\n44:30.120 --> 44:33.400\n And I walked in, there's about 20 or 30 people in there.\n\n44:33.400 --> 44:35.200\n And they was all 30, 40 years old,\n\n44:35.200 --> 44:38.960\n women with plastic or leather skirts\n\n44:38.960 --> 44:40.600\n and me in the blue jeans.\n\n44:40.600 --> 44:42.640\n And I looked around and Barry was at the back.\n\n44:42.640 --> 44:45.080\n He was leaned up, he had gained weight.\n\n44:45.080 --> 44:47.720\n And I walked up and I said, Barry, you wired.\n\n44:47.720 --> 44:48.680\n He said, no.\n\n44:48.680 --> 44:51.480\n I said, well, I'm not gonna talk to these DE agents.\n\n44:51.480 --> 44:53.080\n He said, every one of them.\n\n44:53.080 --> 44:53.920\n So.\n\n44:53.920 --> 44:58.920\n Oh, with jeans and skirts, I like it.\n\n45:00.600 --> 45:02.040\n I said, well, Barry, I'm gonna set you\n\n45:02.040 --> 45:03.480\n and you just talk to me, buddy,\n\n45:03.480 --> 45:05.680\n and tell me what's on your mind.\n\n45:05.680 --> 45:07.320\n And he sat there and he just went to talking.\n\n45:07.320 --> 45:10.440\n And he told me about, he was left holding a bag.\n\n45:11.280 --> 45:12.120\n And it.\n\n45:13.320 --> 45:14.560\n What do you mean by that?\n\n45:14.560 --> 45:16.720\n Like that nobody's supported him?\n\n45:16.720 --> 45:18.400\n Well, I think it's something or another.\n\n45:18.400 --> 45:21.080\n He was, and I don't know this.\n\n45:21.080 --> 45:25.200\n I mean, this is just what happened, putting it all together.\n\n45:25.200 --> 45:28.760\n He had some CIA buddies that was pretending\n\n45:28.760 --> 45:32.080\n we're going to supply all of our Northwood arms.\n\n45:32.080 --> 45:35.520\n And with that, you can land cocaine back here by the ton.\n\n45:35.520 --> 45:38.880\n So he's taking his little planes and putting some AK 47s\n\n45:38.880 --> 45:41.320\n and maybe ammunition or whatever,\n\n45:41.320 --> 45:44.520\n and takes it down to the Contras\n\n45:44.520 --> 45:47.880\n against the Communist Party of Nicaragua,\n\n45:47.880 --> 45:49.360\n where we've been landing.\n\n45:49.360 --> 45:51.360\n And Oliver North was involved in this.\n\n45:51.360 --> 45:55.880\n So when all that, and so his CIA buddies\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:59.440\n was certainly involved, and we know they were.\n\n45:59.440 --> 46:01.840\n And Barry had been in the CIA earlier\n\n46:01.840 --> 46:04.000\n when he first got out of school.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:09.000\n So when, as I say, the shit hit the fan,\n\n46:10.880 --> 46:13.720\n they all fled and left Barry holding the bag.\n\n46:13.720 --> 46:15.400\n The CIA and the DEA.\n\n46:15.400 --> 46:17.960\n Yeah, not the DEA, the CIA.\n\n46:17.960 --> 46:19.120\n The DEA wasn't in on it.\n\n46:19.120 --> 46:22.480\n The CIA was selling that cocaine, bringing it in.\n\n46:22.480 --> 46:23.480\n And.\n\n46:23.480 --> 46:28.120\n Just to clarify, what's Iran Contra scandal?\n\n46:28.120 --> 46:31.720\n What was the alleged involvement of the CIA\n\n46:31.720 --> 46:36.720\n in using drug trade to fund things?\n\n46:37.120 --> 46:38.760\n What do you know?\n\n46:38.760 --> 46:40.960\n What do you think is true?\n\n46:40.960 --> 46:42.560\n What should we know?\n\n46:42.560 --> 46:44.760\n Well, I know what I knew was true,\n\n46:44.760 --> 46:48.000\n that Barry was taking a small amount of arms\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.920\n back to Central America and giving them to\n\n46:50.920 --> 46:54.160\n whoever Oliver North group were.\n\n46:54.160 --> 46:55.000\n Who's Oliver North?\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.200\n Oliver North was a colonel that got implemented\n\n46:57.200 --> 46:58.680\n and almost brought the government down.\n\n46:58.680 --> 46:59.920\n And so they said, all right,\n\n46:59.920 --> 47:02.000\n we're getting the guns from Iran\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.400\n and we're taking cocaine to pay for them.\n\n47:04.400 --> 47:06.920\n And since Congress won't give us money to fight this war,\n\n47:06.920 --> 47:10.120\n we're gonna circumvent it.\n\n47:10.120 --> 47:12.160\n So that was a whole thing.\n\n47:12.160 --> 47:16.480\n So it was a CIA's effort to circumvent\n\n47:16.480 --> 47:20.880\n the funding mechanisms of government by selling drugs.\n\n47:20.880 --> 47:24.800\n Yes, but it was a handful of renegade CIA agents\n\n47:24.800 --> 47:28.720\n that were Barry's friends that was making a load,\n\n47:28.720 --> 47:31.320\n a load of money, tons of it come up.\n\n47:31.320 --> 47:33.360\n If you would like to read the book,\n\n47:33.360 --> 47:37.560\n The Big White Lie, The CIA and the Crack Cocaine Epidemic,\n\n47:37.560 --> 47:39.880\n the CIA put, according to this,\n\n47:40.960 --> 47:43.920\n the book and Michael Levine,\n\n47:43.920 --> 47:46.400\n I didn't remember his name last time I talked,\n\n47:47.560 --> 47:50.360\n wrote that book and he was a head CIA agent,\n\n47:50.360 --> 47:53.920\n he was a head DEA agent that exposed this.\n\n47:53.920 --> 47:55.680\n And the CIA tried to kill him.\n\n47:55.680 --> 47:57.840\n And he says, they put crack cocaine, they developed,\n\n47:57.840 --> 48:00.400\n their chemists developed crack.\n\n48:00.400 --> 48:02.760\n And they put it in every city in the United States\n\n48:02.760 --> 48:04.160\n on one weekend.\n\n48:04.160 --> 48:06.640\n So they were bringing it up by the tons\n\n48:06.640 --> 48:07.600\n and that's for sure.\n\n48:07.600 --> 48:09.600\n And Barry was bringing it.\n\n48:09.600 --> 48:12.720\n Can I ask you a small tangent question?\n\n48:12.720 --> 48:17.720\n Do you think the public should trust the CIA and the DEA?\n\n48:18.680 --> 48:20.740\n Do you think they're mostly good people\n\n48:20.740 --> 48:23.840\n that are carrying out a good mission?\n\n48:23.840 --> 48:25.640\n Because this kind of makes it sound\n\n48:25.640 --> 48:28.640\n like there's renegade agents that are just doing\n\n48:28.640 --> 48:29.960\n whatever the hell they want\n\n48:29.960 --> 48:34.120\n and with sometimes no regard for human life.\n\n48:34.120 --> 48:35.400\n Well, that's certainly true.\n\n48:35.400 --> 48:36.800\n But that's not everybody in there.\n\n48:36.800 --> 48:39.440\n That's just, sometimes you get a few policemen\n\n48:39.440 --> 48:41.600\n in the department that do these things.\n\n48:41.600 --> 48:45.080\n I don't believe, I believe that our government is good.\n\n48:45.080 --> 48:46.760\n I think we've got some fools running it.\n\n48:46.760 --> 48:47.880\n I don't know how we get them there,\n\n48:47.880 --> 48:51.200\n but I don't think I know.\n\n48:51.200 --> 48:54.440\n Okay, so what was Barry's involvement here?\n\n48:54.440 --> 48:56.680\n So Barry leaned back in that chair\n\n48:56.680 --> 49:01.680\n and he told me that he got caught with one and a half tons\n\n49:02.160 --> 49:06.000\n and he bellied it in the runway in Nicaragua\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:11.000\n and had cameras flashing inside and out.\n\n49:11.560 --> 49:14.200\n And he flew it back to Homestead with an agent there\n\n49:14.200 --> 49:18.680\n and he brought the agent over, Jake Jacobson.\n\n49:18.680 --> 49:21.040\n Really nice fellow, I think he was a crop duster.\n\n49:21.040 --> 49:23.400\n And we'd have got along if we'd have been on the right side.\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:26.320\n And so we sat there and drank Chevy's Regal\n\n49:26.320 --> 49:29.400\n until I got pie eyed and Barry told me about it.\n\n49:29.400 --> 49:31.360\n He said that he went to see Edwin Meese.\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:33.160\n He flew his, he got out on bail\n\n49:33.160 --> 49:35.760\n and he flew his Lear jet up to Washington\n\n49:35.760 --> 49:39.000\n and went in to see the Attorney General, Edwin Meese.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.240\n And they run him out of the office.\n\n49:41.240 --> 49:42.360\n The next day he went back and said,\n\n49:42.360 --> 49:45.480\n I have absolute proof that the CIA\n\n49:45.480 --> 49:47.000\n is bringing tons of cocaine\n\n49:48.040 --> 49:50.520\n or they're running tons of cocaine into the United States.\n\n49:50.520 --> 49:53.280\n And Edwin Meese put him up with this agent Jacobson.\n\n49:53.280 --> 49:54.520\n I believe it was.\n\n49:54.520 --> 49:56.840\n And they went down and got one and a half tons.\n\n49:56.840 --> 49:59.280\n And on the way back, they bellied it in\n\n49:59.280 --> 50:02.360\n and Pablo Escobar and some of the other ones\n\n50:02.360 --> 50:04.120\n on general there in Nicaragua,\n\n50:04.120 --> 50:07.320\n you can see them toting it from one plane to the other\n\n50:07.320 --> 50:11.280\n in the book called The Big Kings of Cocaine.\n\n50:11.280 --> 50:13.160\n It's got a mention of me too.\n\n50:13.160 --> 50:15.600\n And also the other one has a mention of me in it.\n\n50:16.560 --> 50:19.760\n Said I'm in more files for the DEA than Noriega.\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:23.320\n So who was wanting to get rid of Barry?\n\n50:23.320 --> 50:25.840\n Is that, who wanted to get rid of Barry more?\n\n50:25.840 --> 50:28.880\n The cartels or the CIA?\n\n50:28.880 --> 50:29.720\n The cartel.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:34.680\n But so Barry leaned back and he told me the story.\n\n50:34.680 --> 50:36.760\n And the tears came down between his fingers\n\n50:36.760 --> 50:38.080\n as he put his hands over his eyes.\n\n50:38.080 --> 50:40.400\n And he said, I just couldn't do it, Roger.\n\n50:40.400 --> 50:42.520\n I just couldn't do three life sentences.\n\n50:42.520 --> 50:43.440\n So I've told him everything.\n\n50:43.440 --> 50:46.240\n I went to Congress and I've testified before Congress.\n\n50:46.240 --> 50:47.520\n He testified before Congress\n\n50:47.520 --> 50:49.320\n for all these things that he had done.\n\n50:49.320 --> 50:52.120\n And he said, I told him all about you,\n\n50:52.120 --> 50:54.240\n but you're under my umbrella.\n\n50:54.240 --> 50:57.360\n You got to testify with me before grand jury in Miami.\n\n50:58.480 --> 51:00.120\n And so the guy said, you can come down,\n\n51:00.120 --> 51:03.040\n the DEA said you can come down tomorrow with Mari,\n\n51:03.040 --> 51:05.960\n first class, or I'll take you down in chains.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.880\n And if you don't testify with Barry,\n\n51:09.880 --> 51:12.440\n the only place you'll ever see your wife and family again\n\n51:12.440 --> 51:14.400\n is in a federal prison visiting room.\n\n51:14.400 --> 51:16.120\n Was that a difficult conversation?\n\n51:16.120 --> 51:19.240\n Oh, my guts was just like ice water.\n\n51:19.240 --> 51:22.320\n I can't testify against my friends.\n\n51:22.320 --> 51:23.800\n I just can't do it.\n\n51:23.800 --> 51:25.000\n How am I going to do it?\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.080\n I just, I can't work with people.\n\n51:27.080 --> 51:28.080\n And he was honest with me.\n\n51:28.080 --> 51:29.680\n How am I going to testify against them?\n\n51:29.680 --> 51:32.480\n I can't spend the rest of my life in a federal prison.\n\n51:32.480 --> 51:35.560\n What on earth, what a mess, Barry, you've got me into.\n\n51:36.920 --> 51:37.800\n So.\n\n51:37.800 --> 51:40.120\n Is that a kind of betrayal there?\n\n51:40.120 --> 51:42.960\n Yes, but it's still, I wish he left me out of it.\n\n51:42.960 --> 51:47.960\n I understand him getting in such a mess that he told,\n\n51:49.360 --> 51:52.280\n because if the CIA and whoever else was behind him\n\n51:52.280 --> 51:54.920\n betrayed him, then he's going to tell everything.\n\n51:54.920 --> 51:56.520\n So I says, all right, I'll be in Miami.\n\n51:56.520 --> 52:00.040\n So Mari and I flew down first class.\n\n52:00.040 --> 52:01.600\n And I went to a lawyer,\n\n52:01.600 --> 52:02.920\n one of the biggest lawyers in Miami.\n\n52:02.920 --> 52:05.160\n And I said, man, I am in a mess.\n\n52:06.160 --> 52:09.520\n This fellow's told everything and I've got to say something,\n\n52:09.520 --> 52:10.840\n but I'm not a snitch, man.\n\n52:10.840 --> 52:13.960\n I mean, what can I do?\n\n52:13.960 --> 52:16.240\n And he said, well, being a snitch is like being pregnant.\n\n52:16.240 --> 52:17.640\n You either are or you're not.\n\n52:22.720 --> 52:24.760\n And he says, I don't represent snitches,\n\n52:24.760 --> 52:26.000\n but if you want to fight this case,\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.520\n I'll do it for $600,000.\n\n52:28.520 --> 52:29.960\n And boy, my face turned red.\n\n52:29.960 --> 52:31.280\n Well, I'm not a snitch.\n\n52:31.280 --> 52:32.840\n He said, well, that's what you're talking about.\n\n52:32.840 --> 52:33.720\n He said, let me tell you something.\n\n52:33.720 --> 52:36.760\n If you go in there and say one thing and sign that paper\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:40.200\n and you don't tell them everything you know,\n\n52:40.200 --> 52:42.440\n then they will convict you of everything you've ever done\n\n52:42.440 --> 52:43.440\n and you tell them.\n\n52:43.440 --> 52:45.440\n So you can't do it.\n\n52:45.440 --> 52:49.120\n So I said, Barry, I'm having trouble with a lawyer.\n\n52:49.120 --> 52:51.200\n Give it, I'll go to Mari, let's go.\n\n52:51.200 --> 52:52.600\n He said, all right, use my lawyer.\n\n52:52.600 --> 52:54.280\n And he gave me his card, the lawyer's card.\n\n52:54.280 --> 52:58.040\n So Mari and I went to the festival restaurant that night\n\n52:58.040 --> 52:59.520\n and Barry and Debbie came in.\n\n52:59.520 --> 53:01.560\n She was dressed pretty and Barry wasn't.\n\n53:01.560 --> 53:02.720\n So we was already about finished.\n\n53:02.720 --> 53:04.320\n So we had dessert together.\n\n53:04.320 --> 53:06.640\n And I said, Barry, they're going to kill you, friend.\n\n53:06.640 --> 53:08.040\n He said, no, they ain't going to kill me.\n\n53:08.040 --> 53:10.160\n So and so, such and such is gone.\n\n53:10.160 --> 53:11.440\n And this and the other.\n\n53:11.440 --> 53:13.800\n I said, Barry, they're going to kill you, man.\n\n53:13.800 --> 53:15.960\n You can't deny it.\n\n53:15.960 --> 53:19.520\n And I said, I didn't tell him I wasn't going to testify.\n\n53:19.520 --> 53:21.720\n So I hugged his neck.\n\n53:21.720 --> 53:24.000\n I really, like, and we fled to Brazil.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.040\n But I took Mari and the children and went to Brazil.\n\n53:26.040 --> 53:27.560\n So you decided there you're not going to stay.\n\n53:27.560 --> 53:30.960\n I knew, I didn't know what I could do.\n\n53:30.960 --> 53:31.800\n I talked to a lawyer.\n\n53:31.800 --> 53:34.160\n I mean, I just didn't, I didn't know what I could do,\n\n53:34.160 --> 53:37.800\n but the best in Miami said what he told me.\n\n53:37.800 --> 53:39.600\n So I had to go.\n\n53:39.600 --> 53:40.720\n And you went to Brazil.\n\n53:40.720 --> 53:41.560\n We went to Brazil.\n\n53:41.560 --> 53:44.760\n Did you have a conversation with anybody at the cartel?\n\n53:44.760 --> 53:48.000\n I mean, that's such an interesting moment\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:53.000\n that tests the man's character to not snitch.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:57.240\n And did you have a conversation with anybody?\n\n53:57.240 --> 53:59.200\n No. Pablo with, about it.\n\n53:59.200 --> 54:00.600\n Not at all.\n\n54:00.600 --> 54:02.240\n So it's just understood.\n\n54:02.240 --> 54:04.360\n I just didn't, couldn't do it.\n\n54:04.360 --> 54:06.400\n But how many men like you are there?\n\n54:06.400 --> 54:07.240\n Not many.\n\n54:07.240 --> 54:09.480\n I had all my friends testified against me.\n\n54:09.480 --> 54:11.440\n I had 11 friends and every one of them put their finger up.\n\n54:11.440 --> 54:12.680\n Roger did it.\n\n54:12.680 --> 54:14.040\n And I was facing life,\n\n54:14.040 --> 54:15.480\n continuing criminal enterprise care.\n\n54:15.480 --> 54:16.560\n And still you couldn't do it.\n\n54:16.560 --> 54:18.480\n I just couldn't do it.\n\n54:18.480 --> 54:21.800\n Did you ever get respect from the cartels for that,\n\n54:21.800 --> 54:22.640\n from the people in the cartel?\n\n54:22.640 --> 54:24.600\n Oh, there was a whole time I got back and stuff.\n\n54:24.600 --> 54:26.960\n They owe me money and I can't get it.\n\n54:26.960 --> 54:27.800\n So.\n\n54:27.800 --> 54:29.080\n Well, that's about money.\n\n54:29.080 --> 54:31.080\n I just mean about human beings.\n\n54:31.080 --> 54:31.920\n Oh, I think so.\n\n54:31.920 --> 54:34.560\n I mean, I've been back down there and I've been welcomed.\n\n54:34.560 --> 54:36.840\n I have my contact.\n\n54:36.840 --> 54:38.400\n And when I was in Brazil,\n\n54:38.400 --> 54:39.440\n I was trying to get this money.\n\n54:39.440 --> 54:41.320\n They owe me three and a half million dollars.\n\n54:41.320 --> 54:43.120\n So I called up there and he was going to pay me.\n\n54:43.120 --> 54:47.040\n Oh, I got 600,000 today and I'll get you some more tomorrow.\n\n54:47.040 --> 54:48.680\n And then the next week I called,\n\n54:48.680 --> 54:51.200\n hey, hey, got great news, great news.\n\n54:51.200 --> 54:52.680\n Barry Seale has been killed.\n\n54:53.880 --> 54:55.160\n So, oh no.\n\n54:55.160 --> 54:56.200\n And I went back to the hotel.\n\n54:56.200 --> 54:59.280\n We was up in the northern part of Brazil\n\n54:59.280 --> 55:00.680\n and where was it, Marty?\n\n55:00.680 --> 55:02.120\n It's been quite a job.\n\n55:02.120 --> 55:03.000\n Yeah.\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.920\n And so I went back and I told Mary and Miriam\n\n55:05.920 --> 55:08.080\n and they cried and I cried.\n\n55:08.080 --> 55:08.920\n I really cried.\n\n55:08.920 --> 55:12.000\n How is that great news from the cartel perspective?\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:15.440\n Well, now there's no case against me and him and them.\n\n55:15.440 --> 55:16.760\n Do you know who killed them?\n\n55:16.760 --> 55:17.600\n Yes.\n\n55:17.600 --> 55:19.160\n I'll tell you about that story.\n\n55:20.080 --> 55:21.800\n On the first load I did,\n\n55:21.800 --> 55:25.600\n I landed at a banana plantation and it was raining\n\n55:25.600 --> 55:28.000\n and it was a muddy strip, clay.\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.320\n And they put the 300 kilos of cocaine\n\n55:30.320 --> 55:32.120\n and then the ugliest man you could imagine,\n\n55:32.120 --> 55:34.680\n named Ronaldo got in there with a Mac 10\n\n55:34.680 --> 55:38.440\n and he was making sure I took it to Louisiana.\n\n55:38.440 --> 55:39.280\n So.\n\n55:39.280 --> 55:40.480\n This is many years before.\n\n55:40.480 --> 55:42.160\n Yeah, a couple of years before.\n\n55:42.160 --> 55:43.000\n So anyway,\n\n55:45.240 --> 55:48.560\n we took off and the mud got up in the wheel well\n\n55:48.560 --> 55:51.600\n so thick until the wheels wouldn't come up.\n\n55:51.600 --> 55:53.200\n Well, I'm going 200 miles an hour\n\n55:53.200 --> 55:55.720\n instead of 300 miles an hour with wheels coming down.\n\n55:55.720 --> 55:57.760\n Well, I can't go back there.\n\n55:57.760 --> 55:59.840\n If I do, I'm gonna be in the same situation\n\n55:59.840 --> 56:02.640\n until the sun dries it out in a few days.\n\n56:02.640 --> 56:05.000\n And so, but in Belize, I had a runway\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:08.560\n that had been used for $10,000 used to refuel.\n\n56:08.560 --> 56:10.080\n So I told the guy, listen,\n\n56:10.080 --> 56:12.480\n we got to land in Belize to refuel.\n\n56:12.480 --> 56:16.080\n No, no, no, we put the Mac 10 and I'll shoot you.\n\n56:16.080 --> 56:17.640\n Go ahead, fool, you're gonna die too.\n\n56:17.640 --> 56:19.640\n So it was in a term.\n\n56:19.640 --> 56:20.480\n So.\n\n56:20.480 --> 56:22.040\n He wasn't just ugly, he was also angry.\n\n56:22.040 --> 56:24.800\n He was a bad, bad killer.\n\n56:24.800 --> 56:28.040\n And so he's the one to actually kill Barry.\n\n56:28.040 --> 56:32.360\n The one that went up on the first load with me.\n\n56:33.360 --> 56:36.240\n And Ronaldo, and he's doing life.\n\n56:36.240 --> 56:37.240\n He's just a killer.\n\n56:37.240 --> 56:39.960\n Yeah, he's doing life in Louisiana.\n\n56:39.960 --> 56:44.640\n I wonder who, is it known who made that decision?\n\n56:44.640 --> 56:48.640\n The younger Ochoa brother, I understand, Fabio,\n\n56:48.640 --> 56:50.840\n which one paid for the hit.\n\n56:50.840 --> 56:52.200\n I don't know that, but that's what I've heard\n\n56:52.200 --> 56:54.040\n and it probably sounds about right.\n\n56:54.040 --> 56:58.520\n He's done in Jessup, Georgia, doing a long, long time.\n\n56:58.520 --> 56:59.360\n I think he's about to get out.\n\n56:59.360 --> 57:01.480\n He's been in 30 years or whatever.\n\n57:03.360 --> 57:04.920\n The movie American Made.\n\n57:07.280 --> 57:09.280\n What do you think that movie got right?\n\n57:09.280 --> 57:11.200\n What did it get wrong?\n\n57:11.200 --> 57:12.440\n Almost everything wrong.\n\n57:14.360 --> 57:16.040\n It was disgustingly wrong.\n\n57:17.800 --> 57:19.960\n Okay, which parts?\n\n57:19.960 --> 57:23.400\n Can you maybe elaborate?\n\n57:23.400 --> 57:26.080\n It's about Barry Seal and it just didn't even,\n\n57:26.080 --> 57:28.760\n it was nothing, whoever wrote it had no idea\n\n57:28.760 --> 57:30.080\n who Barry Seal was.\n\n57:30.080 --> 57:32.120\n They sat in a rocking chair and just tried to think of\n\n57:32.120 --> 57:37.120\n what was some baby bashing drug dealer doing.\n\n57:37.320 --> 57:40.600\n And it's just like, God, you just don't have any idea\n\n57:40.600 --> 57:42.720\n of the spirit of the man.\n\n57:42.720 --> 57:45.040\n So they wanted just to try to tell a fun story\n\n57:45.040 --> 57:47.960\n without actually studying the story.\n\n57:47.960 --> 57:50.040\n They didn't know him, they just had no idea.\n\n57:50.040 --> 57:51.640\n And Barry was such a nice person,\n\n57:51.640 --> 57:54.160\n such a really nice gentleman person.\n\n57:54.160 --> 57:55.840\n They talked to you or no?\n\n57:55.840 --> 57:56.680\n No.\n\n57:56.680 --> 57:57.960\n The people that made the movie.\n\n57:57.960 --> 58:01.720\n And I see all these people telling Barry never met him.\n\n58:01.720 --> 58:02.960\n They telling all about him.\n\n58:02.960 --> 58:05.200\n I think that's just ridiculous.\n\n58:05.200 --> 58:08.000\n And for one thing, for his character coming out\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:10.760\n of warehouses and all that, that was just like ugly.\n\n58:10.760 --> 58:14.360\n And then down in Columbia, putting a gun to his head,\n\n58:14.360 --> 58:17.640\n going to take his sunglasses and then he put $25,000\n\n58:17.640 --> 58:19.840\n million worth of cocaine on his plane.\n\n58:19.840 --> 58:21.080\n And then they're going to bet $100\n\n58:21.080 --> 58:22.920\n he don't have enough room to take off.\n\n58:24.800 --> 58:26.200\n That's just insane.\n\n58:26.200 --> 58:28.680\n I mean, just the whole thing.\n\n58:28.680 --> 58:31.720\n And then he's talking to the DEA agents when he's coming up.\n\n58:31.720 --> 58:34.280\n You don't know what frequency they own,\n\n58:34.280 --> 58:36.200\n how he's got five planes and they all split\n\n58:36.200 --> 58:37.760\n when the DEA comes out.\n\n58:37.760 --> 58:41.080\n These are just somebody just fantasy.\n\n58:41.080 --> 58:43.120\n But those are like, those are details of the man,\n\n58:43.120 --> 58:44.760\n details of the story.\n\n58:44.760 --> 58:47.720\n Is there some big profound things they missed\n\n58:47.720 --> 58:50.440\n about just this whole period?\n\n58:50.440 --> 58:53.280\n But that's something that's really important to you\n\n58:53.280 --> 58:55.000\n that was missed.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:59.000\n Yes, they just tried to sensationalize\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:00.720\n on little things that people remember.\n\n59:00.720 --> 59:01.840\n And it's just not true.\n\n59:01.840 --> 59:06.240\n It was just like a business deal and good people\n\n59:06.240 --> 59:08.960\n and good airplanes and good flying.\n\n59:08.960 --> 59:13.960\n And it was like a good watch that was made.\n\n59:14.240 --> 59:16.640\n It just clicked and it just went on.\n\n59:16.640 --> 59:17.920\n And they missed all of that.\n\n59:17.920 --> 59:20.920\n They tried to make it sound like it's something very ugly.\n\n59:20.920 --> 59:21.840\n Do you think it was a story\n\n59:21.840 --> 59:23.200\n that could have been told way better\n\n59:23.200 --> 59:24.720\n and still be a hell of a good story?\n\n59:24.720 --> 59:26.560\n Oh my goodness, yes.\n\n59:26.560 --> 59:31.560\n Well, there's a series called Chernobyl done by HBO.\n\n59:31.760 --> 59:35.040\n And because I have sort of family connected to that period,\n\n59:36.640 --> 59:40.160\n they did an incredible job of being historically accurate\n\n59:40.160 --> 59:42.280\n and only not being historically accurate\n\n59:42.280 --> 59:45.280\n when it helped the story, only in those rare cases.\n\n59:45.280 --> 59:47.760\n When they on purpose left the story\n\n59:47.760 --> 59:51.240\n to make it easier for people to understand.\n\n59:51.240 --> 59:54.280\n But it was still somehow accurate.\n\n59:54.280 --> 59:57.600\n And even though all the actors were British actors\n\n59:57.600 --> 1:00:00.040\n speaking English with a British accent,\n\n1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:02.400\n it was still somehow accurate.\n\n1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:05.520\n Like they captured the spirit.\n\n1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:06.960\n So it was historically accurate\n\n1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:08.360\n and the spirit was captured.\n\n1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:10.720\n That was one of the most incredible like series\n\n1:00:10.720 --> 1:00:11.720\n I've ever seen.\n\n1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:16.720\n It convinced me that the movie was made by non Russians.\n\n1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:21.640\n It convinced me that if you really care about a story,\n\n1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:23.440\n you don't have to have been brought up in it.\n\n1:00:23.440 --> 1:00:25.320\n You don't even need to speak the language.\n\n1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:27.320\n If you're truly a scholar of it,\n\n1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:29.720\n if you talk to a lot of people, if you learn,\n\n1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:32.760\n if you just pour your heart and soul into it,\n\n1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.640\n you can create something really special.\n\n1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:37.920\n And so your son says you could do that with the story\n\n1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:39.320\n with this period of time.\n\n1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:43.360\n Oh yes, it was a story that needs to be told.\n\n1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:45.040\n It need to be told in the correct way.\n\n1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:49.480\n Not like we're trying to bash a certain angle.\n\n1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:50.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:52.800\n Well, if Netflix or HBO are watching this,\n\n1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:56.520\n you need to tell the story of Roger Rees, in my opinion.\n\n1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:57.480\n There you go.\n\n1:00:57.480 --> 1:00:59.080\n This is a young picture of you.\n\n1:00:59.080 --> 1:00:59.920\n Yeah. There you go.\n\n1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:01.360\n That's from National Geographic.\n\n1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:05.960\n Jorge Archoa, Pablo Escobar, it's you, Roger and Barry.\n\n1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:06.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:09.760\n And the Muggler, a memoir.\n\n1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:13.280\n Yeah, I really do hope that they make a movie of this one.\n\n1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:17.480\n There's a movie called Blow that tells the story\n\n1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:19.880\n of George Young, Boston George.\n\n1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:22.000\n Did you know George Young?\n\n1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.280\n That's one way to ask it.\n\n1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:25.640\n The other is what do you think of the movie Blow?\n\n1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:29.240\n I didn't know George Young, but it was a wonderful movie.\n\n1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:30.640\n Absolutely.\n\n1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:31.800\n It captured it.\n\n1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:32.640\n It did.\n\n1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:33.480\n Yes, it did.\n\n1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:34.600\n That's the way it should be.\n\n1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:36.360\n So he was a little bit before your time?\n\n1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.800\n Exactly the same time.\n\n1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:38.800\n Exactly the same time.\n\n1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:41.720\n He was using stewardesses to fly the marijuana\n\n1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:43.800\n out of Manhattan Beach,\n\n1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:46.160\n and I was on the fire department in Redondo Beach,\n\n1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:49.560\n 10 miles away, flying it up, sending it back.\n\n1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:50.560\n Somebody was sending it back.\n\n1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.960\n He might've been sending it back,\n\n1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:55.720\n but he didn't have near the excitement that I did.\n\n1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:57.840\n I was shot down twice.\n\n1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:00.200\n I escaped from five different prisons.\n\n1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:02.160\n I was tortured almost to death in a Mexican prison.\n\n1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:04.080\n So he didn't have all that fun that I had.\n\n1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:05.040\n Fun in quotes.\n\n1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:09.120\n Yeah, so yours is a heck of a fun adventure.\n\n1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:10.720\n Just to linger on a little bit.\n\n1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:14.440\n So Johnny Depp plays George,\n\n1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.640\n and Ray Liotta plays his father,\n\n1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:20.760\n and there's this son father kind of scene at the end.\n\n1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:23.600\n I don't know.\n\n1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:26.480\n It's heartbreaking.\n\n1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:29.840\n Like that scene paints a picture of a life\n\n1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:34.840\n that could have been had if none of this wild drug\n\n1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:37.400\n smuggling happened.\n\n1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:42.520\n I don't usually, I mean, I don't, I'm almost,\n\n1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:46.920\n I really never get like teary eyed in a movie,\n\n1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:49.000\n but that got me.\n\n1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.160\n It's almost like confronting at the end of your life\n\n1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:56.160\n what your life could have been with your father,\n\n1:02:56.160 --> 1:02:57.640\n the way he calls him Georgie.\n\n1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:02.640\n It, like you fucked up, Georgie.\n\n1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:05.320\n Yes, I did too.\n\n1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:07.120\n I really, really did.\n\n1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:08.880\n Mario waited for me all those years\n\n1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:11.120\n and the children raised them without me,\n\n1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:13.640\n visiting me in prisons all over the world.\n\n1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:14.720\n It's unbelievable.\n\n1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:17.280\n It's just, nothing's worth that kind of money.\n\n1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:18.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:24.440\n Can you tell the story of when you were tortured\n\n1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:27.080\n nearly to death in a Mexican prison?\n\n1:03:27.080 --> 1:03:28.880\n I sure can and I'm smiling,\n\n1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:32.120\n but it was nothing to smile about, I can tell you.\n\n1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:35.680\n I was in a pool and a gentleman came over\n\n1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:37.840\n and shook hands with me and put handcuffs on me.\n\n1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:39.280\n And I thought, what in the world?\n\n1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:41.160\n That was at one of the nice hotels.\n\n1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:45.120\n They put me in a jail cell and I sat there\n\n1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:48.200\n and all the drunks and thieves and stuff kept coming in\n\n1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:50.800\n and they had a bucket and it overrun.\n\n1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:53.000\n And I said, I remember like 18 people in a room\n\n1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.120\n about 12 foot square.\n\n1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:56.800\n Oh, it was hot and I thought,\n\n1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:00.040\n somebody's gotta come get me, this ain't real.\n\n1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:01.360\n I hadn't done anything.\n\n1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:05.160\n It's like, it was a pilot come to see me up in Hermosillo\n\n1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:06.920\n and he stopped and he made a mistake\n\n1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:08.160\n and went to the International Runway\n\n1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:09.960\n instead of where he was supposed to go.\n\n1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:13.880\n And he had my phony name in his pocket, so they got me.\n\n1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:17.880\n So they said I was a drug smuggler.\n\n1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:21.040\n So after about three days, they put me back into the back\n\n1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:23.360\n and it was a torture place.\n\n1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:25.160\n And they put me in a little cell like,\n\n1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:27.000\n I guess it wasn't hard even, it wasn't six feet,\n\n1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.240\n must've been about five feet square and about 12 feet high.\n\n1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.600\n And it was June, the end of June, and it was hot.\n\n1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:36.560\n I mean hot.\n\n1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:40.520\n And they left me in there for, I guess a few days.\n\n1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:43.440\n You didn't know, so every once in a while\n\n1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:45.880\n they'd come drag me out and first off,\n\n1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:47.520\n they put my head under water\n\n1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.680\n and it had seltzer in it or some kind.\n\n1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:52.080\n And I took one whiff of that and three or four of them\n\n1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:53.640\n couldn't hold me down.\n\n1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:56.880\n So then I learned that just before you have to breathe,\n\n1:04:56.880 --> 1:04:59.040\n tear loose like that and they'll let you up.\n\n1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:02.200\n And that was the first treatment.\n\n1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:03.960\n And then they started beating me.\n\n1:05:03.960 --> 1:05:06.320\n And they beat me with a blackjack and rubber hose\n\n1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:08.080\n until I was black and blue and yellow\n\n1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:10.200\n from the bottom of my feet to my head.\n\n1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:11.040\n What did they want from you?\n\n1:05:11.040 --> 1:05:12.920\n They wanted me to sign a confession\n\n1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:14.960\n that I was a drug smuggler.\n\n1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:17.720\n And they put the papers under your nose.\n\n1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:19.000\n This is all over if you'll sign.\n\n1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.400\n Well, I knew if you signed, you got six years.\n\n1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:25.400\n I wasn't gonna sign, I wasn't gonna sign.\n\n1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.760\n But they didn't want you to snitch on anybody.\n\n1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:28.600\n They just wanted you to say.\n\n1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:29.800\n No, they just wanted me to sign that paper.\n\n1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:30.640\n And you still didn't.\n\n1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:32.760\n I didn't even bow to it.\n\n1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:34.800\n I ain't a beat and ate that bad.\n\n1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:35.640\n So.\n\n1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:40.640\n So anyhow, it just got them into the good part.\n\n1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:42.920\n So then they come and they take me out,\n\n1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:44.800\n I'm bug naked and they bend me over\n\n1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:45.920\n and they have things to pull you,\n\n1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:47.560\n like chains click, click, click, click, click.\n\n1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:50.560\n And they bent me over and they put butter\n\n1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:55.320\n on my bum and they commenced to put hot chili pepper\n\n1:05:55.320 --> 1:05:57.640\n up there and that stuff was bad.\n\n1:05:57.640 --> 1:06:02.640\n I mean, it was red hot and that was, that was awful.\n\n1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:06.720\n And still.\n\n1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:07.960\n That was just awful.\n\n1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:09.160\n Yeah, but still you didn't.\n\n1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:10.120\n I didn't think about it.\n\n1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:12.840\n I ain't going to, I guess if I'd have known\n\n1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:14.080\n he was gonna kill me, I wouldn't have done it.\n\n1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:18.320\n But I wasn't about, you get hurt bad enough\n\n1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.680\n you'll pass out, so I didn't pass out.\n\n1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:22.480\n So I was all right.\n\n1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:25.120\n So then the last thing they did was\n\n1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:27.840\n they brought a dead man in there and he was wrapped.\n\n1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:28.680\n He was frozen.\n\n1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:30.400\n He was wrapped in newspaper, little strips\n\n1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:33.000\n about a half inch wide, just like a mummy.\n\n1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.200\n And he was frozen and they hung him on the wall\n\n1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:40.200\n with a meat hook and you next son of a bitch, you next.\n\n1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:43.120\n And so he's sitting there like this\n\n1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:46.440\n and as he starts to throw out, which is pretty quick,\n\n1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:50.120\n it looks like he's crying and it looks like he's peeing\n\n1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:52.600\n and the paper starts unraveling on him\n\n1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:55.360\n and the formaldehyde puddles on the floor.\n\n1:06:55.360 --> 1:06:58.920\n Ooh, what a smell that rotten insides\n\n1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:02.280\n and the formaldehyde and there was a little space.\n\n1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.280\n It wasn't even a half inch high under the door.\n\n1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:06.560\n And I lay on that filthy floor with my cheek\n\n1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:08.160\n and put my lips right up under that door\n\n1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:09.320\n and we're sucking that fresh air.\n\n1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.280\n And I went to sleep after some time.\n\n1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:14.640\n And I know where Walt Disney gets his ideas.\n\n1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:18.240\n I saw white pink pigs with wings on them,\n\n1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:20.720\n all kinds of stuff flying around.\n\n1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:22.840\n So when I woke up, I didn't know which was real\n\n1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:24.560\n and which was the nightmare.\n\n1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:27.480\n It took me a minute to figure out where I was\n\n1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:29.400\n and what was going on.\n\n1:07:29.400 --> 1:07:33.960\n How did you stay mentally strong through that time?\n\n1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:34.800\n Like what?\n\n1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:35.640\n I don't know that I did.\n\n1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:37.920\n I was, yeah, I was mentally strong.\n\n1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:39.320\n So I was just like I am now.\n\n1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:40.160\n Stubborn.\n\n1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:43.000\n I mean, you could be that man that could have killed you.\n\n1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.200\n Yes, I could have.\n\n1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:46.240\n So what gave you hope?\n\n1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:47.320\n Did you have hope?\n\n1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:48.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:49.720\n Or you were just a stubborn son of a bitch?\n\n1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:50.920\n I think some of both of it.\n\n1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:53.440\n And I think they aren't going to keep you here forever.\n\n1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:54.920\n You know, you're going to get out into the prison\n\n1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:56.160\n or they're going to let you go or something.\n\n1:07:56.160 --> 1:07:58.440\n If you sign that paper, you ain't going nowhere.\n\n1:07:58.440 --> 1:07:59.640\n And I want to go home.\n\n1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:05.240\n I got shot down a few weeks before that.\n\n1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:07.040\n I got shot from out of the sky.\n\n1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:08.680\n 80 bullet holes through the plane,\n\n1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:09.960\n killed a fellow on the ground,\n\n1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:12.880\n shot the leg nearly off the man in the plane.\n\n1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:13.720\n Where was this?\n\n1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:15.160\n In that little place of Peachy Lingy.\n\n1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:16.000\n You want to tell you that story?\n\n1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:16.840\n And they were shooting you from the ground.\n\n1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:17.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:18.520\n All right.\n\n1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:20.560\n A little 900 foot strip there at Peachy Lingy,\n\n1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:23.000\n a poor, poor village with starving donkeys.\n\n1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:24.080\n And that's where they'd,\n\n1:08:24.080 --> 1:08:26.200\n I'd give them $17,000 for the load.\n\n1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:27.880\n And I'd go over on the highway and load.\n\n1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:31.120\n Well, on day 13, I did a load every day for 13 days.\n\n1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:33.480\n They had a bunch of marijuana, pretty good piled up.\n\n1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:35.320\n And I was going low today.\n\n1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:39.120\n And on day 13, I had that little warning sign\n\n1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:40.240\n going off in my stomach.\n\n1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:42.800\n Uh oh, uh oh, don't do it.\n\n1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:45.200\n But I asked this Joaquin,\n\n1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:47.040\n oh, we had the federal, all this paid off,\n\n1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:47.880\n nowhere we were.\n\n1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:49.800\n So I spent the night in a hammock\n\n1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:52.720\n and walked down to the airplane,\n\n1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.440\n just as it get in daylight.\n\n1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:57.400\n And 10 or 12 men walked with me and Pedro got in.\n\n1:08:57.400 --> 1:08:58.920\n I brushed my teeth in the little stream.\n\n1:08:58.920 --> 1:09:00.400\n It was about foot deep,\n\n1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:02.440\n a little river coming through there.\n\n1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:05.400\n And got in the airplane and I fired her up.\n\n1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:06.440\n Bam, blah, blah.\n\n1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:09.640\n And bam, I thought a tire blew out.\n\n1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:14.200\n I looked over and it still ain't dawned on me.\n\n1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:16.880\n And Pedro was yelling, police here, police here Roger,\n\n1:09:16.880 --> 1:09:17.720\n police here.\n\n1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:19.520\n Well, it dawned on me.\n\n1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:23.360\n And I shoved it, the throttle to the firewall.\n\n1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:24.200\n And I only had about.\n\n1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:25.880\n So that was a bullet.\n\n1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:28.440\n Yeah, somebody, there's officer sides, they'd shot.\n\n1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:31.120\n They'd shot just a warning, like get out, stop.\n\n1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:33.360\n We're gonna rob you, whatever it is.\n\n1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:34.720\n That's what they do.\n\n1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:35.880\n They just taking the plane and me\n\n1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.280\n and put me in prison, old thing.\n\n1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:39.760\n So, but I, even though I had papers.\n\n1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:41.720\n So I just shoved it to the firewall\n\n1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:43.920\n and there wasn't enough room to take off on that strip.\n\n1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:46.080\n And there's half of it was behind me\n\n1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:47.640\n or some of it was behind me.\n\n1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:49.720\n And so just at the end, I'm just like,\n\n1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:51.880\n I think that thing stalls at about 50 miles an hour.\n\n1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:55.760\n Just turning 50 and I just pulled it right up\n\n1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:57.560\n and put the flaps on.\n\n1:09:57.560 --> 1:09:59.720\n And as I pulled off the ground,\n\n1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:02.200\n they opened up on both sides of me with machine guns\n\n1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:03.800\n and they riddled that airplane.\n\n1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:06.600\n I mean, the windshield came out.\n\n1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:08.120\n I got hit three times.\n\n1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:10.400\n You, like your body?\n\n1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:11.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:14.520\n And I didn't know I was hit.\n\n1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:17.840\n I mean, it was just the gasoline just pouring in.\n\n1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:18.920\n The world turned yellow.\n\n1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:20.680\n I must've went into shock.\n\n1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:23.480\n So it just stopped in slow motion.\n\n1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:26.720\n And one bullet hit the strut right by my head.\n\n1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:30.920\n And it just, parts of that bullet just went all over me.\n\n1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:35.320\n I just looked like I'd been peppered with lead.\n\n1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:37.560\n And the gasoline was just pouring in.\n\n1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:40.200\n I mean, just pouring in where they'd shot the wing up above\n\n1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:41.840\n and the windshield's gone.\n\n1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:46.080\n I mean, it was just like a hail storm.\n\n1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:48.440\n So I was...\n\n1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.760\n Airplanes did stall or no?\n\n1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:53.120\n I was in a stall anyway, and I didn't realize it.\n\n1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:55.320\n And I guess you wouldn't unless you trained for it.\n\n1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:56.720\n But when you're in a stall,\n\n1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:59.840\n the elevator is kind of flappy.\n\n1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:01.280\n And I didn't realize it at the time.\n\n1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:04.040\n I thought they had shot the elevator cable in too.\n\n1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:05.120\n So I thought, oh God.\n\n1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:07.160\n So I just reached over and switched it off,\n\n1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:09.840\n switched the mixture, pulled everything.\n\n1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:12.600\n And in the river, there was rocks\n\n1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:14.400\n about as big as this table.\n\n1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:16.200\n And they were like the turtle back\n\n1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:17.840\n all the way up until there was a waterfall.\n\n1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:19.640\n There's quite a pretty place.\n\n1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:21.280\n And I crashed straight onto it.\n\n1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:22.960\n I thought if I get those rocks.\n\n1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:25.680\n And when I did the first time I hit, the wings came off\n\n1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:26.560\n and then it bounced.\n\n1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:28.240\n And the next time the nose came up\n\n1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.360\n and came under the plane and I'm sitting there,\n\n1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:31.800\n I must've been knocked unconscious\n\n1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:32.800\n called Pedro shaking me.\n\n1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:34.720\n Come on, Roger, come on, Roger.\n\n1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:37.360\n So I stepped out into the water\n\n1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.960\n and here comes these four Federalists\n\n1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:40.200\n still shooting at us.\n\n1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:42.800\n And I'm bulleted to hit the airplane.\n\n1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:45.800\n And I kept a nine millimeter Browning high power\n\n1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:49.640\n taped to the top of the radio in case I ever needed it.\n\n1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.840\n So, cause you didn't want it in the airplane.\n\n1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:55.320\n So I just, it was just handy just laying there.\n\n1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:57.040\n So I took and popped a few caps out of them\n\n1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:58.560\n and they ran into the rocks.\n\n1:11:59.840 --> 1:12:03.080\n So we took off running.\n\n1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:05.320\n And then I looked and Pedro's foot nearly shot off.\n\n1:12:05.320 --> 1:12:07.160\n They'd shot him on one side of the ankle\n\n1:12:07.160 --> 1:12:08.920\n and it just blown out the other side.\n\n1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:11.720\n And it wasn't even hardly bleeding, the shock of it.\n\n1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:13.760\n So I took my T shirt off and gripped it\n\n1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:15.080\n and tied it best I could.\n\n1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:16.400\n But you had still bullets in you.\n\n1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:17.840\n So like you could still run.\n\n1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:20.120\n I shot the top of my toenail off.\n\n1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:22.560\n I shot it across my head and my kneecap.\n\n1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:23.720\n So I was just nicked.\n\n1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:24.880\n Okay, got it.\n\n1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:26.600\n It was very painful later on,\n\n1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:29.520\n but right that time I didn't, it was just hot.\n\n1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:31.240\n And there's a bullet still in my foot from it,\n\n1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:32.360\n a piece of a bullet.\n\n1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:33.480\n Good size slug.\n\n1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:37.320\n So we went on up the mountain through the cactus\n\n1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:38.440\n and just running.\n\n1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:39.520\n Just going, I want to go down.\n\n1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:42.360\n No, no, the federal is going the easy way.\n\n1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:44.240\n Let's go, this young fella.\n\n1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:45.720\n And we came to an old donkey.\n\n1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:48.760\n She must've been 30 years old, long and way back,\n\n1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:51.680\n long hair on her, Charlotte, Charlotte.\n\n1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:54.040\n And he petted the donkey and we jumped on.\n\n1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:54.880\n And we rode for seven.\n\n1:12:54.880 --> 1:12:55.800\n Like an actual donkey?\n\n1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:56.640\n A donkey.\n\n1:12:56.640 --> 1:12:57.600\n There were donkeys all over the place.\n\n1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:59.680\n Anyhow, he knew that one from the village.\n\n1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:01.720\n And so we rode seven miles, two of us,\n\n1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:04.080\n on a donkey with no bridle, no saddle, nothing.\n\n1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:08.360\n And we came to a little man plowing a little horse\n\n1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:09.560\n and a little ox.\n\n1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:11.720\n Both of them were spotted and the ox was,\n\n1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:13.440\n the yoke was across their back this way.\n\n1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:15.720\n And he was plowing with a little plow among stumps.\n\n1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:17.160\n It was like one of these people clearing\n\n1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:18.240\n a little piece of land.\n\n1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:20.160\n And he had a little house there.\n\n1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:21.400\n And so we went into his house\n\n1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:22.600\n and his wife and his daughter,\n\n1:13:22.600 --> 1:13:26.760\n they put like a cloth over my wounds and on Pedro's.\n\n1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:28.760\n It was terrible.\n\n1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:32.840\n And they poured diesel oil on it to keep the flies off.\n\n1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:34.520\n So I'm covered in diesel.\n\n1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:38.120\n So the man left and he was gone all day.\n\n1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:39.520\n And then about dark, he showed up,\n\n1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:42.320\n maybe about 15 or 20 horses and mules showed up\n\n1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:44.240\n in the yard, walking fast.\n\n1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:45.280\n And a doctor got out, he said,\n\n1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:48.120\n I'm Dr. Benjamin Soso with Red Cross.\n\n1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:50.280\n And he worked on my foot and he worked on Pedro.\n\n1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:53.440\n He gave us a shot of morphine and tetanus shots.\n\n1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:55.400\n And he said, you got to get to hospital.\n\n1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:57.680\n He said, Pedro will die if he don't get to hospital.\n\n1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:00.200\n He said, they are looking for American pilots\n\n1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:02.000\n been shot down and they think he's dead.\n\n1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.160\n There was a lot of blood in that airplane.\n\n1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:07.840\n And so they rode, I don't know how far we rode,\n\n1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.720\n but we rode miles and we'd come to a road\n\n1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:10.960\n and there was a big truck\n\n1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.880\n and it was loaded with corn in the ear.\n\n1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:15.120\n And they dug holes in that corn, put us in it\n\n1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:17.240\n and covered us up.\n\n1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:18.240\n And the road was rough.\n\n1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:20.560\n And every time we'd hit a dirt road,\n\n1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:21.760\n that corn would cover me up.\n\n1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:24.360\n They'd scratch my face out again.\n\n1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:26.600\n And when they came to the highway,\n\n1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:28.680\n we went into a house and they got me some clothes\n\n1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:32.320\n and mine was messed up and a white basin.\n\n1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:35.080\n And they must've brought 20 jugs of water different times.\n\n1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:36.640\n I kept washing and washing my foot\n\n1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:39.080\n till all the blood and the crud got off of me\n\n1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:40.920\n and put on those clothes.\n\n1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:42.840\n And somebody went to, they said,\n\n1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:44.400\n you can't go North, the road's blocked.\n\n1:14:44.400 --> 1:14:45.760\n They're looking for the pilot.\n\n1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:47.080\n So you got to go South.\n\n1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:50.240\n So they found a taxi in Mazatlan.\n\n1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:52.480\n And it was a rather new taxi.\n\n1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:54.600\n And the fellow would take me to Guadalajara,\n\n1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:58.480\n which was, I don't know, seven, eight hours South.\n\n1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:00.160\n So we got in that taxi and they propped me up\n\n1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:03.520\n with sheets and blankets and pillows in the back seat\n\n1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:06.800\n and gave me these great big white pain pills.\n\n1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:08.800\n And I was quite content.\n\n1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:12.240\n Then I was shot down in Columbia also.\n\n1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:14.920\n What, can you tell that story?\n\n1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:15.880\n I sure can.\n\n1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:20.560\n All right, I went down for a load of marijuana\n\n1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:23.920\n and we got to the place and we got there too early.\n\n1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:26.200\n And the guerrillas screamed,\n\n1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:28.160\n you got to get out of here, you got to get out of here.\n\n1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:31.080\n And so we went back to the place where we stayed from\n\n1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:32.320\n and refueled.\n\n1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:36.200\n I had a beautiful DC3, carried three tons.\n\n1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:39.560\n And so while I was waiting,\n\n1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:44.560\n I ate something for lunch and I went around behind the house.\n\n1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.680\n We refueled a plane up and I had to wait till late afternoon.\n\n1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:49.400\n They wanted me to come just at dark\n\n1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:54.400\n so the military planes couldn't see me on their strip.\n\n1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:57.440\n So I'm leaning in the hammock asleep\n\n1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:59.080\n and I hear this terrible roar.\n\n1:16:00.320 --> 1:16:02.040\n And I looked right up through the trees\n\n1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:05.240\n and at the end of two military jets going straight up.\n\n1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:09.280\n They do a dive over and they came back down the strip\n\n1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:11.120\n in front of that airplane and they just tear it up\n\n1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:12.880\n with 50 caliber machine guns.\n\n1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:14.920\n They just showing out.\n\n1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:18.440\n So I run for the airplane, I just give that guy $80,000\n\n1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:19.480\n and he ran for the truck\n\n1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:21.160\n and all the rest of them ran for the truck.\n\n1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:22.720\n I should have ran with my money,\n\n1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:25.720\n but I didn't, I ran for the airplane.\n\n1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:28.720\n And the copilot got in and his name was Al.\n\n1:16:28.720 --> 1:16:30.600\n He got in with me and two fellows got in the back.\n\n1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:32.600\n We had drums of fuel in there to refuel\n\n1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:34.560\n when we got down to the guerrillas.\n\n1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:39.680\n So we took off and I couldn't get the gear up\n\n1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:41.280\n because I'd taken off in such a hurry.\n\n1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:45.440\n These pins in the struts of a DC3 and with big flags on them\n\n1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:46.360\n and you have to take them up\n\n1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:49.000\n so that the plane won't come up.\n\n1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.640\n So these jets swarmed on me and they tried to get me to go.\n\n1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:53.040\n They kept telling me which way to go\n\n1:16:53.040 --> 1:16:54.800\n and the pilot would be just as close\n\n1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:55.880\n as just right over there.\n\n1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:56.720\n I could see him.\n\n1:16:56.720 --> 1:16:58.440\n I just held up the old iffy piece.\n\n1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:00.320\n I didn't think they would shoot.\n\n1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:02.040\n I really didn't.\n\n1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:03.520\n Nobody had shot before.\n\n1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:07.920\n So I kept flying out and I kept getting slower and slower\n\n1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:09.600\n and they kept slowing down, down, down\n\n1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:11.680\n and the black smoke rolling.\n\n1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:13.960\n And then they started shooting up under me.\n\n1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:16.680\n Boom, boom, boom, boom with them 20 millimeter cannons.\n\n1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:18.480\n And then the tracers just going up.\n\n1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:20.480\n They looked like they're curving up from me.\n\n1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:22.360\n I woo and I pushed the nose over\n\n1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:23.520\n so they couldn't get under me.\n\n1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:26.240\n And later on I heard they thought I tried to ram them.\n\n1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:30.480\n So one of them went for fuel and I kept on going\n\n1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:34.440\n and the one just tore the left wing tip up\n\n1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:35.600\n with the 50 caliber.\n\n1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:38.560\n And then he come back again and shot the tail up.\n\n1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:39.840\n He's warning me.\n\n1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:41.040\n And I tell the feller in there, I says,\n\n1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:42.840\n you know, if you bring me enough water,\n\n1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:44.400\n I believe I can fly this thing.\n\n1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:45.880\n My mouth got quite dry.\n\n1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:52.400\n So I went on and I landed on a big pasture.\n\n1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:57.720\n And it was huge pasture and it was rougher than it looked.\n\n1:17:57.720 --> 1:17:59.720\n And the wings just flapped and I come to a stop\n\n1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:01.880\n and jumped out and pull those tabs out,\n\n1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:04.640\n threw them on the ground so I could get my gear up.\n\n1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:07.440\n And I understand that during the 1980 World Series\n\n1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:10.600\n baseball game that it says American DC three\n\n1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:12.680\n has just been shot down by American jets,\n\n1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:14.200\n by Colombian jets.\n\n1:18:14.200 --> 1:18:15.920\n You know, it's the first plane shot down\n\n1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:17.560\n on Reagan's new war on drugs.\n\n1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:19.560\n But he's up, he's up and away, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:20.800\n We keep you posted.\n\n1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:24.040\n So I took off again and I went into a thunderstorm\n\n1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:26.040\n and they came close to the mountains.\n\n1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:28.520\n So I spiraled up and every time I'd come out,\n\n1:18:28.520 --> 1:18:30.920\n that jet was there, boom, boom, boom.\n\n1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:35.040\n And I'd go back into that storm and boom, boom, boom\n\n1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:37.920\n in there and at 20,000 feet, I started icing up.\n\n1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:40.120\n So I went out one last time and he was right there waiting.\n\n1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:41.320\n He had me on radar.\n\n1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:43.320\n So I went back in and I kicked it over\n\n1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:46.360\n and put it into a spin and went straight down to 2000 feet\n\n1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:48.000\n and come out under it.\n\n1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:51.280\n And I was flying along the Guaviera River\n\n1:18:52.360 --> 1:18:54.680\n and it was 20 feet above the water.\n\n1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:57.480\n It looked like a pasture, it was just grass.\n\n1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:00.680\n And I made several runs to tear the grass down\n\n1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:02.600\n and it looked like, and it felt hard.\n\n1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:04.680\n That old DC three weighs 30,000 pounds\n\n1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:06.760\n and I put it down on the fifth run.\n\n1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.920\n I said, all right, now we're gonna land now.\n\n1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:09.760\n And as I was.\n\n1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:11.840\n Did you do like close several times?\n\n1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:12.760\n I put the wheels down.\n\n1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:15.200\n Oh, you put the wheels down without landing.\n\n1:19:15.200 --> 1:19:18.760\n And just, so I'm making a run for it, you know.\n\n1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:19.760\n So you, okay.\n\n1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.000\n So you're being tracked by a jet.\n\n1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:23.840\n He's going.\n\n1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:25.800\n He's trying to, well, before that,\n\n1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:29.200\n I'm just like retelling this story, how insane it is.\n\n1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:32.080\n So he's trying to shoot you down\n\n1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:36.000\n and there's a thunderstorm that you're escaping into.\n\n1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:39.740\n And then you do a spin down to what, 2000 feet?\n\n1:19:39.740 --> 1:19:43.360\n Whatever you said, like somehow escaping all of this.\n\n1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:46.340\n And then you try to land on a pasture\n\n1:19:46.340 --> 1:19:50.000\n on a giant heavy plane that carries three tons\n\n1:19:51.720 --> 1:19:55.240\n by touching down five or six times\n\n1:19:55.240 --> 1:19:58.800\n to make a landing strip for yourself.\n\n1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:01.640\n Yeah, the grass is three or four feet high.\n\n1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:04.440\n So it looked really good after about, after a few times.\n\n1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:05.720\n So then just before it stopped,\n\n1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:07.600\n I said, Al, take your feet off the brakes.\n\n1:20:07.600 --> 1:20:09.200\n He said, I don't have my feet on the brakes.\n\n1:20:09.200 --> 1:20:11.800\n Well, I knew I had broken through the crust\n\n1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:13.840\n and I put full power on, but it didn't.\n\n1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:15.520\n That old big plane just come on down\n\n1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:18.440\n and it just did a head, as it came to a stop,\n\n1:20:18.440 --> 1:20:21.920\n it did a headstand, 90 degrees to the ground.\n\n1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:22.760\n Oh, wow.\n\n1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:24.880\n And the engines held it up\n\n1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:27.140\n and the nose and all just crushed in right on it.\n\n1:20:27.140 --> 1:20:29.600\n We fell between the two seats to keep from getting killed.\n\n1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:30.440\n Wow.\n\n1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:31.320\n And when it come to a stop,\n\n1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:34.160\n all that fuel was pouring out on those hot engines\n\n1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:35.680\n and there was an escape hatch at the top.\n\n1:20:35.680 --> 1:20:39.320\n I just stepped out, took my suitcase with me.\n\n1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:41.480\n Was there fire?\n\n1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:43.240\n No fire, left the plane there\n\n1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:44.480\n and the two guys that was in the back,\n\n1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:46.840\n one of them broke his thumb and it was with the barrels\n\n1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:49.000\n and they had to put a hose,\n\n1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.840\n tie gas hose together to shimmy down to get out.\n\n1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:53.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:54.160\n So.\n\n1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:55.780\n That's an incredible story.\n\n1:20:55.780 --> 1:20:56.800\n Well, let me just tell you,\n\n1:20:56.800 --> 1:20:58.160\n they had a little bit more to it.\n\n1:20:58.160 --> 1:20:59.400\n I learned to fly with the idea\n\n1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:02.440\n of being a missionary aviation fellowship pilot,\n\n1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:04.800\n fly the missionaries in and out of the jungle.\n\n1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:06.480\n Well, I went 11 days through that jungle.\n\n1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:09.040\n The rest of them went on down the road and went to prison.\n\n1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:12.560\n I said, I'll crawl on my belly six months in here a year,\n\n1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:14.800\n eating snakes before I'm going down the road.\n\n1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:18.120\n So I went in there and I was 11 days in the jungle\n\n1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:21.600\n and I finally came to this place and it had airplanes.\n\n1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:24.080\n I kept asking the Indian, dandistai avions.\n\n1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:26.460\n I want to steal an airplane and get out of there.\n\n1:21:26.460 --> 1:21:28.320\n And when I came to the place,\n\n1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:29.800\n I asked, what is this place?\n\n1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:30.640\n Lovely place.\n\n1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:34.160\n It looked like Honolulu in World War II.\n\n1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:35.080\n There was a runway there.\n\n1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:36.680\n Said, you don't know.\n\n1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:38.240\n This is Loma Linda headquarters\n\n1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:41.780\n for Missionary Aviation Fellowship for the Amazon.\n\n1:21:41.780 --> 1:21:43.240\n And they flew me out.\n\n1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:44.160\n Wow.\n\n1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:48.920\n You escaped from prison five times?\n\n1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:52.560\n So what stands out to you as the most difficult\n\n1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:55.680\n or miraculous escape in the bunch?\n\n1:21:58.660 --> 1:22:00.040\n The most black miraculous was\n\n1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:01.720\n when I was in the courtroom in Spain.\n\n1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:04.400\n I think I was on the third floor of Real High\n\n1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:06.840\n and I ran across the courtroom, handcuffed,\n\n1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:08.200\n kicked the window out.\n\n1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:10.480\n And I looked down and it was above the palm trees.\n\n1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:11.840\n I thought there might be a power line\n\n1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:13.860\n or something I could grab on as I went down.\n\n1:22:13.860 --> 1:22:14.980\n There was nothing.\n\n1:22:14.980 --> 1:22:18.400\n And there was a car parked, a station wagon on the side.\n\n1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:19.600\n You just jumped out?\n\n1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:22.660\n I jumped out from 31 feet and on top of that car.\n\n1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:24.560\n And it exploded in the street.\n\n1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:26.600\n The windshield went over three or four cars.\n\n1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:27.960\n It looked like snow going up.\n\n1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:30.880\n And I looked like Donald Duck with the thing coming off\n\n1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:32.600\n and handcuffs and I got out.\n\n1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:33.440\n And you just kept running?\n\n1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:34.280\n Yeah, I kept running.\n\n1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:35.800\n They ran me down and hit me in the back.\n\n1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:37.200\n I still got a dead spot in my back\n\n1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:39.960\n where the policeman hit me with a shotgun.\n\n1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:41.100\n And they brought me back.\n\n1:22:41.100 --> 1:22:43.260\n Murray was there and they were saying,\n\n1:22:43.260 --> 1:22:44.700\n your husband is crazy.\n\n1:22:44.700 --> 1:22:45.760\n That was spectacular.\n\n1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:48.820\n But I escaped from Lubeck, maximum security prison.\n\n1:22:48.820 --> 1:22:50.640\n And I cut out of there and got out.\n\n1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:51.480\n That was a miraculous escape.\n\n1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:52.420\n And that was where?\n\n1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:54.120\n In Lubeck, Germany.\n\n1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:56.520\n What was that escape like?\n\n1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:59.280\n I was there and they was going to extradite me\n\n1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:00.200\n back to the United States\n\n1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:01.640\n where I still had all these charges\n\n1:23:01.640 --> 1:23:03.460\n and 25 years special parole.\n\n1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:09.360\n And I was cleaning the lawyer's visiting room\n\n1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:14.800\n and on it was bars that looked like piano notes\n\n1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:17.000\n or this way to make it pretty.\n\n1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:18.880\n But they was a little bit,\n\n1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:22.640\n so I got a rope from a guy where they made boats in there.\n\n1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:25.780\n And I had 20 minutes.\n\n1:23:25.780 --> 1:23:27.480\n So I went in there and I wrapped it around\n\n1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:28.680\n and I put a broom handle in it\n\n1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:30.360\n that was cut off and wrapped it around\n\n1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:33.000\n until they pull the bars together on that side.\n\n1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.400\n And then I pulled them together on the other side.\n\n1:23:34.400 --> 1:23:37.720\n But that only put me in inside the prison yard\n\n1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:40.680\n where the soccer equipment was kept.\n\n1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:44.420\n But they were putting new windows on one side of the prison\n\n1:23:44.420 --> 1:23:47.460\n and they had it scaffolded up to the fourth floor.\n\n1:23:47.460 --> 1:23:48.800\n So there was a little recess there\n\n1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:52.080\n and there was guard towers every 100 feet or so.\n\n1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:53.880\n I mean, they would shoot and kill you.\n\n1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:57.900\n So I got behind that and climbed up holding to the bricks\n\n1:23:57.900 --> 1:23:59.720\n on one hand and the scaffolding on the other\n\n1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:00.600\n and went to the roof.\n\n1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:02.160\n I lost my shirt and most of my clothes\n\n1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:03.120\n going through the window.\n\n1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:04.520\n I got all the skin off of me.\n\n1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:05.780\n I thought I was gonna die.\n\n1:24:05.780 --> 1:24:07.440\n And I was trying to go sideways like this.\n\n1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:10.440\n And finally I got a grip and the bars let me through\n\n1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:12.360\n and took all the skin off of me.\n\n1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:14.760\n So I got up on that roof and I have asthma\n\n1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:16.600\n and I just lay there trying to catch my breath.\n\n1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:17.800\n Didn't bring my inhaler.\n\n1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:21.200\n With blood everywhere.\n\n1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:22.680\n Oh, I was bloody, yes.\n\n1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:24.440\n And so I got down to the end\n\n1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:26.200\n and on the end, the reason I did it,\n\n1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:29.080\n they would put it, they was putting a new wall again\n\n1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:32.040\n around the prison to make it larger.\n\n1:24:32.900 --> 1:24:36.960\n And they had taken all the wire off above the Sally port\n\n1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:38.620\n where they could join the two walls together.\n\n1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:42.040\n And I saw that when I came up and there was a guard,\n\n1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:46.520\n a half of like a dome sticking out of that brick building\n\n1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:48.840\n where there's a guard there with a gun and he'd kill you.\n\n1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:49.680\n And I mean, he was made,\n\n1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:51.400\n he was surely trained to kill you.\n\n1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:53.960\n And we had some bad people in that place.\n\n1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:56.520\n So I lay up one floor above it\n\n1:24:56.520 --> 1:24:59.120\n and I saw a guard and his wife come with a double umbrella.\n\n1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:00.720\n It was just pouring down the rain.\n\n1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:03.100\n Here I am without a shirt on, bloody.\n\n1:25:03.100 --> 1:25:07.240\n And she had a little boy with him under that double umbrella\n\n1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:08.600\n and I knew him and when he come\n\n1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:10.800\n and she started back from the Sally port,\n\n1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:15.000\n I hit the top of that guard tower, bam, with both feet.\n\n1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.260\n And I jumped, I guess it's three more floors.\n\n1:25:17.260 --> 1:25:19.240\n I jumped, there was a pile of sand,\n\n1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:21.200\n like a cone where they were digging it there.\n\n1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:24.600\n And I hit that and my feet buried up to the knees,\n\n1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:26.080\n but I didn't fall.\n\n1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:28.840\n And I ran straight towards her so he couldn't shoot me.\n\n1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:31.480\n And then I went around some bushes and went downhill.\n\n1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:35.840\n And then I heard bam, bam, bam, bam, bam behind me.\n\n1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:38.280\n And I looked and that fool woman was in a big old car\n\n1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:41.200\n and she was knocking down the parking meters behind me.\n\n1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:42.640\n She was trying to run over me.\n\n1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:44.600\n And I ran behind the car\n\n1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:47.260\n and she tore the fender off of her car,\n\n1:25:47.260 --> 1:25:49.000\n trying to yell and yow, yow, yow,\n\n1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:51.640\n and a terrible evil looking face at me, screaming at me.\n\n1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:53.840\n And the sirens going off in the prison.\n\n1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:57.240\n And there was a fence there, a wall.\n\n1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:58.980\n And I jumped up on it to jump over\n\n1:25:58.980 --> 1:26:00.560\n and it had glass embedded.\n\n1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:03.320\n And I cut my hands and my arms all up getting over that.\n\n1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:04.960\n And I hit the ground on the other side\n\n1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:07.720\n and it was like, it was that mucked muck\n\n1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:09.560\n where some farmer had dug it.\n\n1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:12.680\n I dug in there and Maury had slipped me $200 into prison.\n\n1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:15.440\n And I had that in my shoe and I lost my shoes in that muck.\n\n1:26:15.440 --> 1:26:17.680\n But anyway, I got out of there and got to Holland.\n\n1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:19.680\n Really a heck of a story how I did that.\n\n1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:23.360\n What was prison like, whether it's Germany\n\n1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:24.920\n or whether it's Australia?\n\n1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:28.160\n What were some of the darker moments in prison?\n\n1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:30.360\n The United States prisons are awful,\n\n1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:32.200\n awful evil places now.\n\n1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:34.700\n And just really, there's nothing nice about them.\n\n1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:36.000\n There's the guards.\n\n1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:38.400\n In LA?\n\n1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:40.600\n And everyone I went to.\n\n1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:42.360\n It seemed like the further east I went to Oklahoma\n\n1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.400\n and it was nicer, but all of them on the West Coast,\n\n1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:47.120\n they was hatred there.\n\n1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:50.920\n And they got really stupid people hired, just incredibly.\n\n1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:52.720\n Oh, hatred by the guards.\n\n1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:55.600\n And the inmates, like I speak Spanish\n\n1:26:55.600 --> 1:26:58.840\n and I walked in to the Spanish TV room\n\n1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:01.960\n and it was saying, you know, no, you can't come in here.\n\n1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:03.320\n And I walked across to the black,\n\n1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:06.000\n hey, get out of here, white boy.\n\n1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:07.880\n It was just like, what?\n\n1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:10.200\n Man, I like all you people, you know?\n\n1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:12.120\n And so I walked down to the white people and said,\n\n1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:13.840\n show us your paperwork.\n\n1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:16.560\n You can't come in here until you show your paperwork.\n\n1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:19.000\n We don't let snitches and homosexuals\n\n1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.160\n and all this sort of stuff in here.\n\n1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:23.820\n So they have, so it's just like,\n\n1:27:23.820 --> 1:27:25.520\n man, I don't wanna be in here.\n\n1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:26.800\n I mean, it sounds absurd,\n\n1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:29.800\n but you're saying like the basic humanity is gone.\n\n1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:32.360\n Completely, completely in the guards.\n\n1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:35.000\n It was just like, come here, Reeves.\n\n1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.880\n And I woke up to him, get the fuck out of my face.\n\n1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:40.920\n Sticks his chin out, like for me to break his jaw.\n\n1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:44.080\n Like, what in the world, man?\n\n1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:45.440\n I love people and it's just.\n\n1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:48.320\n Yeah, you got this joy to you.\n\n1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:50.000\n You have a joyful nature.\n\n1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:53.600\n And it didn't seem like that broke you.\n\n1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:54.920\n Not a bit.\n\n1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:56.700\n How did you persevere?\n\n1:27:56.700 --> 1:27:58.160\n Did you know, I didn't even think I persevered,\n\n1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:01.720\n but I try to enjoy my life wherever I am every day.\n\n1:28:01.720 --> 1:28:02.560\n I do.\n\n1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:03.920\n I ran every day.\n\n1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:06.240\n And like I told you, why do you run so, Roger?\n\n1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:08.440\n I said, to help me suffer these fools.\n\n1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:10.720\n And I played a game of chess every day,\n\n1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:12.280\n almost of my life in there.\n\n1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:14.480\n And I read two books a week.\n\n1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:16.480\n And I talked with people, storytellers,\n\n1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:18.840\n guys would come in and, tell us another story, Roger.\n\n1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:19.680\n Give us a poem.\n\n1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:21.440\n Tell us one you never told us before.\n\n1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:22.440\n And so it was just nice.\n\n1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:23.920\n A lot of them have original boys.\n\n1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.800\n They picked their country music and it was all right.\n\n1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:31.080\n Red, Morgan Freeman's character\n\n1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:35.280\n in The Shawshank Redemption says the following.\n\n1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:36.780\n These walls are funny.\n\n1:28:36.780 --> 1:28:39.560\n First you hate them, then you get used to them.\n\n1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:42.960\n Enough time passes you get, so you depend on them.\n\n1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:44.900\n That's institutionalized.\n\n1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:47.160\n Is there truth to that?\n\n1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:49.560\n 100%, I didn't even see the walls,\n\n1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:51.720\n except whenever I was planning on escaping.\n\n1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:56.160\n In Shawshank Redemption, he spent so many years in prison\n\n1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:00.200\n that he almost didn't know what to do with himself\n\n1:29:00.200 --> 1:29:02.800\n once he left, once he was a free man.\n\n1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:08.240\n That's the, you get so used to the system,\n\n1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:12.940\n the rituals, having to follow orders,\n\n1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:16.900\n even being treated poorly,\n\n1:29:16.900 --> 1:29:20.160\n all those kinds of things that you become dependent on.\n\n1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:23.980\n Well, down in Australia, I spent the first,\n\n1:29:23.980 --> 1:29:26.500\n a little over a year in the shoe.\n\n1:29:26.500 --> 1:29:28.820\n It was like, did you see the movie,\n\n1:29:28.820 --> 1:29:32.360\n The Silence of the Lambs, thank you, Marty.\n\n1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:34.740\n And he said, I had five or six guards\n\n1:29:34.740 --> 1:29:36.980\n looking at me with a one way mirror.\n\n1:29:36.980 --> 1:29:38.960\n And that's whenever I thought I might never get out,\n\n1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:40.080\n I got a life sentence.\n\n1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:43.000\n I had all this time waiting here in Germany.\n\n1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:48.000\n And so that's, they had a computer in there,\n\n1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:50.040\n but it didn't have a program on it.\n\n1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:51.640\n And I wrote, so I just started writing\n\n1:29:51.640 --> 1:29:53.560\n these little stories of stuff I did in my life.\n\n1:29:53.560 --> 1:29:57.280\n And I wrote one line and I wrote over a million words\n\n1:29:57.280 --> 1:29:58.120\n with them looking at me.\n\n1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.920\n So it was after a year, they let me out.\n\n1:29:59.920 --> 1:30:01.240\n It wasn't long before they put me\n\n1:30:01.240 --> 1:30:02.920\n in a place called Self Care.\n\n1:30:02.920 --> 1:30:07.860\n And particularly, I was in what they call the lifers pod.\n\n1:30:07.860 --> 1:30:10.700\n There was 268 men in Self Care there.\n\n1:30:10.700 --> 1:30:15.700\n And it was unbelievably good that we were left alone.\n\n1:30:17.300 --> 1:30:19.300\n Basically, they was there or the guards\n\n1:30:19.300 --> 1:30:22.160\n were certainly there, but they had their shack\n\n1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:26.780\n and we had apartments, four apartments to the building.\n\n1:30:26.780 --> 1:30:29.660\n And six men to the unit with your own door\n\n1:30:29.660 --> 1:30:32.420\n and a key to it and a kitchen, dining room,\n\n1:30:32.420 --> 1:30:34.020\n freezer, refrigerator.\n\n1:30:34.020 --> 1:30:38.380\n And they gave you, allowed you $360 a week to buy groceries.\n\n1:30:38.380 --> 1:30:43.060\n And I cooked for about 16 years and learned to cook good.\n\n1:30:43.060 --> 1:30:46.580\n And the people and other people have their specialties.\n\n1:30:46.580 --> 1:30:51.580\n And so that was quite, it wasn't so like being in prison.\n\n1:30:53.160 --> 1:30:55.620\n It was somewhat living with me and it was difficult, man.\n\n1:30:55.620 --> 1:30:58.660\n I had some good fights and carry on.\n\n1:30:58.660 --> 1:31:00.540\n You don't get along with everybody.\n\n1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:03.660\n But then whenever I came back to the United States,\n\n1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:05.500\n I was laughing and talking.\n\n1:31:05.500 --> 1:31:07.940\n And when I got off the plane in LA,\n\n1:31:07.940 --> 1:31:11.100\n I had three marshals with me from Australia.\n\n1:31:11.100 --> 1:31:13.020\n I was slammed upside the wall.\n\n1:31:13.020 --> 1:31:18.020\n I mean, hard, put ankle mics on and handcuffed so tight\n\n1:31:19.220 --> 1:31:20.980\n till they cut my lane off.\n\n1:31:20.980 --> 1:31:23.780\n Face forward, face forward, lands apart.\n\n1:31:23.780 --> 1:31:25.180\n Good gracious.\n\n1:31:25.180 --> 1:31:28.500\n And walked me 50 steps and turned me over to the marshals\n\n1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:29.700\n and they took part of that off.\n\n1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:31.700\n That was a border patrol that was there\n\n1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:34.700\n over my marijuana charge from 1977.\n\n1:31:36.340 --> 1:31:38.460\n I did 11 years for parole violation.\n\n1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:40.140\n Now they want me for more violation.\n\n1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:42.660\n And they put me in, down in Los Angeles,\n\n1:31:42.660 --> 1:31:45.300\n they put me in, the marshals put me in there\n\n1:31:45.300 --> 1:31:47.260\n and they put me in isolation.\n\n1:31:47.260 --> 1:31:50.420\n I thought, what in the world they got me for isolation for?\n\n1:31:50.420 --> 1:31:51.420\n I'm doing anything.\n\n1:31:53.140 --> 1:31:55.380\n How long did you spend in isolation?\n\n1:31:55.380 --> 1:31:57.140\n More than six months.\n\n1:31:57.140 --> 1:32:00.060\n So I, after three or four days\n\n1:32:00.060 --> 1:32:02.580\n as the little Judas window slide open\n\n1:32:02.580 --> 1:32:04.460\n and a man, a nice looking man in a suit come there,\n\n1:32:04.460 --> 1:32:07.500\n hello Reeves, I wanna, just wanna see what you look like.\n\n1:32:07.500 --> 1:32:10.220\n I saw your National Geographic documentary\n\n1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:12.780\n and it does me pleasure to keep you in isolation.\n\n1:32:12.780 --> 1:32:15.180\n And he slammed the thing and I couldn't get out of there.\n\n1:32:15.180 --> 1:32:17.140\n And by law, the US Parole Commission\n\n1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:20.300\n is supposed to give you a hearing within 90 days.\n\n1:32:20.300 --> 1:32:22.820\n So Murray paid a lawyer $7,500\n\n1:32:22.820 --> 1:32:25.180\n and he never picked up the phone.\n\n1:32:25.180 --> 1:32:28.540\n Somebody got to him.\n\n1:32:28.540 --> 1:32:29.820\n Who's that somebody you think?\n\n1:32:29.820 --> 1:32:31.180\n Christopher Cannon was his name\n\n1:32:31.180 --> 1:32:32.540\n and I don't know who got to him,\n\n1:32:32.540 --> 1:32:35.700\n but he didn't do anything to get me out of there.\n\n1:32:35.700 --> 1:32:38.420\n I got one 15 minute phone call a month\n\n1:32:38.420 --> 1:32:39.620\n and I couldn't get out.\n\n1:32:40.540 --> 1:32:45.540\n So then after six months, they put me on Conair,\n\n1:32:47.340 --> 1:32:51.540\n double shackled and black box on my hands.\n\n1:32:51.540 --> 1:32:53.780\n And I went to Oklahoma\n\n1:32:53.780 --> 1:32:58.540\n and they let me out on the floor.\n\n1:32:58.540 --> 1:32:59.420\n I couldn't imagine.\n\n1:32:59.420 --> 1:33:01.540\n Then I could call after a couple of days\n\n1:33:01.540 --> 1:33:03.900\n and they said, there was a man here from Washington\n\n1:33:03.900 --> 1:33:07.060\n give you a parole hearing and you only got here at 3.30.\n\n1:33:07.060 --> 1:33:09.220\n So he left, he said he'd be back next year.\n\n1:33:10.100 --> 1:33:11.220\n What?\n\n1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:13.020\n I've been in now over six months.\n\n1:33:13.020 --> 1:33:14.540\n So then there was a lovely little lady,\n\n1:33:14.540 --> 1:33:16.780\n she was a case manager or something.\n\n1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:19.940\n She said, you can ask for parole on the record.\n\n1:33:19.940 --> 1:33:21.460\n And I said, please do.\n\n1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:22.780\n So I sent them an email\n\n1:33:22.780 --> 1:33:25.140\n and the next day I got my parole.\n\n1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:27.420\n 90 days later, they sent me to Terminal Island\n\n1:33:27.420 --> 1:33:29.780\n and put me in the place there with the invalid,\n\n1:33:29.780 --> 1:33:32.740\n I guess since I'm as old as I am, 78 years old.\n\n1:33:32.740 --> 1:33:34.380\n So they put me in the people in there dying\n\n1:33:34.380 --> 1:33:38.220\n and wheelchairs and legs off and arms off and cancer.\n\n1:33:38.220 --> 1:33:40.780\n So I was in there and I pushed the fellows around\n\n1:33:40.780 --> 1:33:44.060\n and I went, come out of the chow hall there\n\n1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:46.420\n and I went to go to the right to get me a haircut\n\n1:33:46.420 --> 1:33:49.340\n and the two Mexican guys there, Lieutenant and another one,\n\n1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:52.020\n walked between us and he went like the boop, boop, boop.\n\n1:33:52.020 --> 1:33:53.420\n I could outrun you.\n\n1:33:53.420 --> 1:33:55.940\n And they slammed me, put me on the ground,\n\n1:33:55.940 --> 1:33:58.300\n handcuffed me and put me in the shoe for a week.\n\n1:33:59.180 --> 1:34:02.140\n I got out and man, they put me back in the place.\n\n1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:04.100\n They treated me rough.\n\n1:34:04.100 --> 1:34:06.660\n So I got in a little more trouble\n\n1:34:06.660 --> 1:34:10.700\n and they put me back in the shoe and I wouldn't come out.\n\n1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:14.060\n They had that, the virus was out killing people.\n\n1:34:14.060 --> 1:34:16.980\n So they killed eight people in that unit I was in.\n\n1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:19.260\n So I mean, I wouldn't even come out to take a shower.\n\n1:34:19.260 --> 1:34:22.140\n I had a little straw that I put in the sink\n\n1:34:22.140 --> 1:34:26.340\n and I'd take a sock that I had and scrub myself with it\n\n1:34:26.340 --> 1:34:28.780\n with some slope and a glass of water over my head\n\n1:34:28.780 --> 1:34:31.060\n and then clean the floor up and put it in the toilet.\n\n1:34:31.060 --> 1:34:34.180\n So that was your time during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n1:34:34.180 --> 1:34:36.580\n I got out last April, right in the middle of it\n\n1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:39.020\n and they were dying bad in there.\n\n1:34:40.420 --> 1:34:42.700\n So I was treated worse for that last year in America\n\n1:34:42.700 --> 1:34:44.860\n than I was for the whole 20 years in Australia,\n\n1:34:44.860 --> 1:34:46.660\n the 18 years in Australia.\n\n1:34:46.660 --> 1:34:50.780\n And then you were a free man at the end of that year.\n\n1:34:50.780 --> 1:34:52.460\n They put me out and sent me home\n\n1:34:52.460 --> 1:34:54.600\n and the parole officers couldn't even come.\n\n1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:55.440\n They weren't working.\n\n1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:57.340\n They were just doing everything by video.\n\n1:34:57.340 --> 1:35:00.020\n They said, better not have a drink.\n\n1:35:00.020 --> 1:35:01.740\n The only constituent thing was\n\n1:35:01.740 --> 1:35:03.620\n I couldn't even have a drink of wine.\n\n1:35:03.620 --> 1:35:08.580\n So after a year, I had to take psychiatric treatment.\n\n1:35:08.580 --> 1:35:11.220\n Every week I had to go talk to the psychiatrist,\n\n1:35:11.220 --> 1:35:14.220\n psychologist and me and her got along great.\n\n1:35:14.220 --> 1:35:15.460\n She was a good Christian woman.\n\n1:35:15.460 --> 1:35:16.900\n We just chatted and talked.\n\n1:35:16.900 --> 1:35:17.740\n And I think they said,\n\n1:35:17.740 --> 1:35:19.780\n so I had to pee in the bottle every week.\n\n1:35:19.780 --> 1:35:21.360\n I said, I've been in 33 years.\n\n1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:23.680\n How many piss deaths do you think I've had?\n\n1:35:23.680 --> 1:35:24.520\n Never been dirty.\n\n1:35:24.520 --> 1:35:26.940\n Only thing if you all wanna clean when you come get me.\n\n1:35:26.940 --> 1:35:29.020\n Before I talk to you about love,\n\n1:35:29.020 --> 1:35:32.300\n let me ask you a difficult question.\n\n1:35:33.220 --> 1:35:34.740\n You write in your book,\n\n1:35:34.740 --> 1:35:37.400\n ''I don't consider myself much of a criminal.\n\n1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:39.660\n I don't lie, cheat or steal.\n\n1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:43.020\n And I always take up for the underdog.\n\n1:35:43.020 --> 1:35:45.380\n Violence makes me sick.\n\n1:35:45.380 --> 1:35:47.740\n Yet I know I'm an outlaw\n\n1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:50.280\n and those that break the law must be punished.\n\n1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:53.520\n I think many people listening to this\n\n1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:55.660\n or some people listening to this\n\n1:35:55.660 --> 1:35:58.720\n will see you as a criminal, as a bad man\n\n1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:01.320\n who increased the amount of suffering in this world.\n\n1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:04.260\n What do you have to say to them?\n\n1:36:06.060 --> 1:36:06.900\n I would like to tell them\n\n1:36:06.900 --> 1:36:10.780\n that they have been indoctrinated by the spin\n\n1:36:10.780 --> 1:36:12.700\n of news and politicians\n\n1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:15.460\n and they don't know the truth of the situation.\n\n1:36:15.460 --> 1:36:17.180\n You lay the truth out there in an envelope,\n\n1:36:17.180 --> 1:36:20.620\n let me open it besides something else that is false\n\n1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:22.020\n and it's staggering.\n\n1:36:22.020 --> 1:36:24.780\n The truth is that I was a tobacco farmer\n\n1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:31.100\n and tobacco kills 500,000 people a year in America\n\n1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:34.820\n and 6 million have debilitating diseases because of it.\n\n1:36:36.820 --> 1:36:39.980\n Drugs, all drugs combined kill\n\n1:36:39.980 --> 1:36:43.220\n between 10 and 15,000 people a year by overdose\n\n1:36:43.220 --> 1:36:45.720\n and 60% of those are pharmaceutical.\n\n1:36:46.580 --> 1:36:48.340\n Now, then when I was a tobacco farmer,\n\n1:36:48.340 --> 1:36:50.200\n come sit on the front pew, Mr. Reeves,\n\n1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:52.100\n come on up here, you're a gentleman.\n\n1:36:52.100 --> 1:36:55.020\n You just joined the Masonic Lodge and you joined our church\n\n1:36:55.020 --> 1:36:58.160\n and you just come on and sit down with the good people.\n\n1:36:58.160 --> 1:36:59.860\n You grow two marijuana plants,\n\n1:36:59.860 --> 1:37:02.100\n get out of here you scumbag\n\n1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:04.380\n and the marijuana doesn't hurt anybody.\n\n1:37:04.380 --> 1:37:06.560\n It's just, that's the truth of it.\n\n1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:10.640\n And so in your career,\n\n1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:16.000\n you walked amidst violence\n\n1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.100\n but you never participated in the violence.\n\n1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:19.300\n I didn't even see it.\n\n1:37:21.860 --> 1:37:23.920\n Just didn't happen around me, in prison it did.\n\n1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:25.600\n I sewed people up, they called me doc.\n\n1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:30.600\n I had dental floss and one time I had to get a blade\n\n1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:35.960\n and try to help keep from my patient from getting again.\n\n1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:40.520\n But I was just like, if I shot at those people,\n\n1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:42.760\n I shot at them to keep them from killing me.\n\n1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:44.560\n I certainly didn't mean to kill them.\n\n1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:47.600\n So that's just, some people are evil\n\n1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.760\n and they will kill you and hurt you and lie to you.\n\n1:37:49.760 --> 1:37:51.120\n I just don't do any of that.\n\n1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:52.960\n It just makes you sick.\n\n1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:54.120\n I've seen it.\n\n1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:56.640\n When I was in the shoe, three guys tried to kill a guy\n\n1:37:56.640 --> 1:37:57.840\n and they stabbed him so many times,\n\n1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:01.440\n but they stabbed Blake and the blood getting out of the room.\n\n1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:02.280\n I said, you're gonna kill him.\n\n1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:04.080\n You're gonna kill him and save his life.\n\n1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:06.800\n Drug him up there where the guards could see him.\n\n1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:07.640\n There's stuff like that.\n\n1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:09.960\n I'm just not of that nature of those people.\n\n1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:10.960\n They're just evil.\n\n1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:12.840\n They're people born evil, I believe.\n\n1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:18.240\n It is heartbreaking to hear that the basic humanity\n\n1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:21.360\n is gone in prison in the United States.\n\n1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:23.560\n That's heartbreaking because that basic humanity\n\n1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:25.480\n is actually the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n1:38:25.480 --> 1:38:28.160\n It's the thing that saves us as opposed to,\n\n1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:30.720\n when it's absent, it's the thing that destroys us.\n\n1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:34.200\n The prisons are filled, absolutely filled with people\n\n1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:35.960\n that have some mental problems.\n\n1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:40.760\n Now, you see Tent City all the way up and down here.\n\n1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:42.560\n I guarantee you, every one of those people\n\n1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:45.720\n have mental problems, some degree.\n\n1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:48.480\n However little it is, but they are a little bit off.\n\n1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:50.720\n Now, then you get a DEA agent\n\n1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:52.520\n that wants to make a name for himself.\n\n1:38:52.520 --> 1:38:54.000\n He goes down there and gets two of them,\n\n1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.600\n one of them to sell a little two grams of methamphetamine\n\n1:38:56.600 --> 1:38:58.760\n to the other one, and he gets a conviction.\n\n1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:00.880\n And a young prosecutor, he gets a conviction.\n\n1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:02.440\n He wants to make a judge.\n\n1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:04.760\n And we got the judge in, where was it?\n\n1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:06.760\n I'm gonna give a million, what was his name?\n\n1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:07.600\n Gilbert.\n\n1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:09.320\n I'm gonna give him in a million years\n\n1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:10.440\n before I get off the judge.\n\n1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:14.680\n You get fools like that in charge.\n\n1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:19.160\n You're gonna fill prisons up with pitiful humanity.\n\n1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:21.240\n And those are the ones.\n\n1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:25.480\n And then the other is people over drugs.\n\n1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:29.760\n And drugs should be a health issue.\n\n1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:36.160\n You cannot police it enough.\n\n1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:38.280\n It's just, they know the only thing\n\n1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:41.160\n that overdoses is opioids, the heroin.\n\n1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:42.320\n And if they can give it to him,\n\n1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:43.680\n it costs about a dollar a day\n\n1:39:43.680 --> 1:39:46.640\n to give the worst addict his fix.\n\n1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:47.720\n But they'll give it methadone,\n\n1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:49.640\n which is from a pharmaceutical company,\n\n1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:51.440\n which is just as bad.\n\n1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.560\n Why in the world, we tried it all over the world\n\n1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:57.480\n in Portugal and England.\n\n1:39:57.480 --> 1:40:00.280\n And when they give the girls cleanup,\n\n1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:03.640\n no more stolen cars, why?\n\n1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:07.160\n Who wants to keep this farce going?\n\n1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:08.600\n They just perpetuating it.\n\n1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:11.720\n Like, oh, every little police place\n\n1:40:11.720 --> 1:40:15.440\n is getting all these suits and armor and machine guns.\n\n1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:19.800\n It's just like, oh, it's such a spin, it's sad.\n\n1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:22.000\n Do you think all drugs should be legalized?\n\n1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.480\n I don't know about that,\n\n1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:26.760\n but they certainly should be controlled.\n\n1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:28.080\n If a person is an addict,\n\n1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:32.200\n he should be able to go down and get his fix\n\n1:40:32.200 --> 1:40:33.440\n with somebody there to help him\n\n1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:36.000\n with a clean needle and a glass of orange juice.\n\n1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.280\n It's so much cheaper than prison.\n\n1:40:38.280 --> 1:40:40.800\n It's so much cheaper than him stealing cars\n\n1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:42.840\n or a prostitute having to go to work.\n\n1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:43.720\n That's sad.\n\n1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:46.520\n You've lived one heck of a life.\n\n1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:51.920\n Looking back, there's a lot of young people\n\n1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:55.960\n that listen to this, high school, college students.\n\n1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:57.680\n What advice would you give them?\n\n1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:02.000\n How to live, how to have a successful career,\n\n1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.960\n how to have a good life, how to be a good man or woman?\n\n1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:09.440\n To be a good man or woman,\n\n1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:12.520\n if I had it to do over with,\n\n1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:14.200\n I'll just tell you what I'd have done.\n\n1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:16.920\n I would have paid attention and studied my lesson\n\n1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:18.320\n and did the best I could.\n\n1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:21.320\n In school. In school, yes.\n\n1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:23.080\n And went as far as I could have.\n\n1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:24.480\n I would have liked to been a doctor.\n\n1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:25.880\n I just didn't have the stickability\n\n1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:29.760\n or anybody to tell me, hey, go over there and do that.\n\n1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:32.800\n And if you can do that at a very young age,\n\n1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:36.080\n start in a trade, learn to do something.\n\n1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:38.240\n It doesn't matter what it is.\n\n1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:40.320\n If you learn to do something good,\n\n1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:42.680\n there is a great demand for you.\n\n1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:46.000\n And I would say that in prison,\n\n1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.880\n that the prison system should come in\n\n1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:51.200\n and you get a thief, young fans of thief,\n\n1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:56.200\n robber, and you say, all right, we need carpenters.\n\n1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:57.240\n We need plumbers.\n\n1:41:57.240 --> 1:41:58.080\n We need electricians.\n\n1:41:58.080 --> 1:41:59.240\n We need sheep.\n\n1:41:59.240 --> 1:42:02.080\n Sentence them to that trade.\n\n1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:03.720\n And when you get an A plus in that,\n\n1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:06.360\n where you can go out and make you $30 or $50 an hour,\n\n1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:07.960\n you go home.\n\n1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:10.480\n Now you can mess around 10 years if you want to,\n\n1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:11.840\n or you can do this in two.\n\n1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:14.760\n I think that's just for the prison.\n\n1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:17.480\n But anyway, I would say that they find somebody\n\n1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:19.000\n and be true to them.\n\n1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:24.000\n That we have, just be honest and true in your life.\n\n1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:27.720\n You mean like relationships, friendships?\n\n1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:28.560\n Relationships, yes.\n\n1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:31.320\n I mean, so many, so many people,\n\n1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:34.840\n particularly our children, are from relationships\n\n1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:37.960\n where they not wanted their divorce.\n\n1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:38.840\n Their father's left.\n\n1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:40.360\n They don't know who their daddy is.\n\n1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:42.080\n They're just in foster homes.\n\n1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:45.760\n 500,000 children are in foster homes in America today.\n\n1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:49.200\n And we have, and our government inadvertently\n\n1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:51.400\n isn't encouraging those people.\n\n1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:54.240\n My daughter is a doctor and she delivered a couple\n\n1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:58.280\n of years ago a baby from a 10 year old child.\n\n1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:00.480\n That child, and she said in the visiting room\n\n1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:03.200\n is four generations, all of them on welfare.\n\n1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:04.320\n Now we got one more.\n\n1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:08.360\n And it reminds me of Elvis Presley's song, In the Ghetto.\n\n1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:13.360\n So for an individual, learn a trade, become a craftsman,\n\n1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:16.720\n learn a trade, become a craftsman of sorts,\n\n1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:19.720\n and find somebody to love and who loves you.\n\n1:43:19.720 --> 1:43:24.720\n That's right, have a family and stick with it.\n\n1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:27.120\n Surely you're gonna get angry.\n\n1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:28.240\n You're gonna get disappointed.\n\n1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:29.400\n You're gonna get all kinds of stuff,\n\n1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:33.240\n but come back and make up before you go to sleep.\n\n1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:37.040\n Well, I did half of those things.\n\n1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:38.960\n I got the first one and working on the second one.\n\n1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:40.480\n So I appreciate the advice.\n\n1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:45.320\n Well, Mari, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:47.920\n Can you tell me the story of how you two met?\n\n1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:52.720\n Well, my parents every summer would go to the lake\n\n1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:56.080\n in Canada and the place was called Turkey Point,\n\n1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:00.040\n which is on Lake Erie, and just have a nice summer holiday\n\n1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:03.640\n there, water skiing, swimming, sunbathing.\n\n1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:06.760\n This was back in the 60s and I was sitting on the pier\n\n1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:10.120\n with a few girlfriends and telling them my story.\n\n1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:12.520\n And then all of a sudden I looked up\n\n1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:17.520\n and I saw this figure in the distance coming onto the pier.\n\n1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:21.240\n Now we're all dressed in bathing suits and swimwear.\n\n1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:22.920\n We're swimming and this, that, and the other.\n\n1:44:22.920 --> 1:44:25.480\n And here he comes, dark trousers.\n\n1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:30.480\n In fact, they were black, white shirt and a tie\n\n1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:34.040\n and a straw kind of a Panama hat.\n\n1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:38.360\n And so he stood out.\n\n1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:41.160\n And so I invited him to come and sit down.\n\n1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:43.880\n And so he continued to talk and we just talked\n\n1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:47.200\n and talked and talked and then later moved to the beach.\n\n1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:50.320\n And I think the next time I saw him,\n\n1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:53.080\n he was talking to another girl and I thought, yeah,\n\n1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:58.080\n you know, I know, I was okay, okay, next.\n\n1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:02.360\n Well, but six months later I receive a letter\n\n1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:05.120\n and it's a letter from Roger.\n\n1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:07.560\n And then we start this lovely correspondence\n\n1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:10.000\n and we just start writing, you know, in those days,\n\n1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:11.840\n you just wrote everything.\n\n1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:16.120\n And then the next summer he was coming up again.\n\n1:45:16.120 --> 1:45:20.640\n He was on his way to Alaska and he says,\n\n1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:22.440\n I would like to come by and see you.\n\n1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:24.160\n And I said, well, I'll be in the same place\n\n1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:26.240\n that I met you last year.\n\n1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:29.720\n And so when he came up this time,\n\n1:45:29.720 --> 1:45:32.760\n for some reason Roger reached for my hand\n\n1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:36.440\n and I reached for his and man, that was it.\n\n1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:39.560\n It was like love at first touch.\n\n1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:40.400\n That was love.\n\n1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.640\n It was just like a silence, you know, and oh my gosh.\n\n1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:47.440\n And we didn't even look at each other.\n\n1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:50.200\n It was just, oh my goodness, what happened here?\n\n1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:52.920\n And I was the type of person, I never wanted to get married,\n\n1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:56.600\n not way, way, way down the road, never have any children.\n\n1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:59.760\n And I wanted to see the world first and then do all that,\n\n1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:02.280\n you know, and.\n\n1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:03.800\n But that was it, that was love\n\n1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.280\n and you've been together ever since.\n\n1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:06.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:11.000\n Well, the thing is about the love\n\n1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.240\n that the two of you have for each other\n\n1:46:13.240 --> 1:46:16.740\n is it had to persevere through quite a heck of a journey.\n\n1:46:17.940 --> 1:46:22.940\n So how did Roger's drug smuggling\n\n1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:27.760\n change the nature of your love and your relationship?\n\n1:46:27.760 --> 1:46:31.360\n Well, Lex, that remained steadfast.\n\n1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:36.140\n It endured and since Roger's been home,\n\n1:46:36.140 --> 1:46:39.240\n I think we've rekindled the love that we had\n\n1:46:39.240 --> 1:46:40.920\n when we first met.\n\n1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:42.320\n Yeah, what?\n\n1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:46.840\n But I think my faith, you know, my faith,\n\n1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:50.240\n my steadfast faith and also the fact\n\n1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:51.960\n that Roger and I communicated.\n\n1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:55.640\n We wrote letters, you know, he never complained.\n\n1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:57.120\n I know there were the children there.\n\n1:46:57.120 --> 1:46:58.800\n He never had mistreated me.\n\n1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:02.080\n I love this guy and we had a lot of experiences.\n\n1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:03.920\n It was just, even though I.\n\n1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:06.040\n He's good looking, charismatic, he's pretty, you know.\n\n1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:09.040\n Yeah, and he was adventurous, you know,\n\n1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:12.960\n and I, would you say that again?\n\n1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:18.440\n But yes, it was just, I know, you know,\n\n1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:20.600\n I missed him physically, but he was just,\n\n1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:24.640\n we were just so strong in spirit, you know,\n\n1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:28.300\n and we could talk to one another.\n\n1:47:28.300 --> 1:47:29.180\n Yep.\n\n1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:33.920\n Well, what was it like, Roger, when you're a free man\n\n1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:40.020\n seeing Mari for the first time in person again?\n\n1:47:40.020 --> 1:47:42.080\n I cried for three days.\n\n1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:44.160\n Everything, I had to look at a picture of her.\n\n1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:48.120\n I came home and there she prepared a meal for me\n\n1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:53.600\n and it was the old oak table that I'd redone\n\n1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:57.160\n and the chairs, the same one, and the green placemats\n\n1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:01.320\n and the same china that we had and the same silverware.\n\n1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:03.200\n And it just, just all of it just brought back\n\n1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:04.960\n the same paintings on the wall.\n\n1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:06.000\n It was just like unbelievable.\n\n1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.880\n After 35 years, she had all my clothes cleaned\n\n1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:12.720\n and my shoes shining and I put the shoes on\n\n1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:14.440\n and I walked out on the strings on this\n\n1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:16.760\n and the soles came off, but the shirts\n\n1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:18.480\n and all fit perfect and everything.\n\n1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:19.880\n So it was just wonderful.\n\n1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:22.800\n And just to see her and then just to think about,\n\n1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:24.680\n see her picture of her 50th birthday\n\n1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:28.320\n or her 60th birthday or her 70th birthday.\n\n1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:30.000\n I wasn't there.\n\n1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:31.440\n And the picture of her and with the children,\n\n1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:33.160\n it just, it was heartbreaking.\n\n1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:34.400\n And about the third day, I thought,\n\n1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:37.320\n man up, fella, I mean, you've got to.\n\n1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:42.320\n So I got over it and quit the tears.\n\n1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:45.800\n It was, everything was just pulsating with life.\n\n1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:48.800\n It was just unbelievable to get out of that place.\n\n1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:49.980\n It really was.\n\n1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:54.980\n Is there, do you regret the drug smuggling\n\n1:48:57.900 --> 1:49:00.900\n that took you away from the woman you love?\n\n1:49:00.900 --> 1:49:03.740\n Oh yes, 100%.\n\n1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:08.340\n Just, you know, I wouldn't have done it again\n\n1:49:08.340 --> 1:49:11.300\n if you don't think you're going to get caught.\n\n1:49:11.300 --> 1:49:14.900\n And it's just, no, it's just, I did it for money\n\n1:49:14.900 --> 1:49:16.380\n and I had everything in the world I wanted\n\n1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:18.220\n before I did that.\n\n1:49:18.220 --> 1:49:22.860\n So the adventure, I mean, it was one heck of an adventure\n\n1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:25.220\n for the two of you, for the both of you.\n\n1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:29.020\n Were you able to enjoy it or was it always danger?\n\n1:49:29.020 --> 1:49:33.160\n Was it always something that threatened your relationship,\n\n1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:35.660\n your love, your family?\n\n1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:37.460\n Or were you able to enjoy the adventure of it?\n\n1:49:37.460 --> 1:49:39.060\n You know, we'll all die.\n\n1:49:39.060 --> 1:49:40.460\n Life is short.\n\n1:49:40.460 --> 1:49:42.840\n And to live that kind of adventure.\n\n1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:46.340\n Well, whenever I did the first loot, I got $10,000.\n\n1:49:46.340 --> 1:49:48.540\n And that was just about, that was just about two years\n\n1:49:48.540 --> 1:49:50.580\n pay on the fire department take home.\n\n1:49:50.580 --> 1:49:52.380\n And I brought that home and.\n\n1:49:52.380 --> 1:49:54.100\n I put my hand over my mouth.\n\n1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:57.540\n I said, Roger, I can't believe this.\n\n1:49:57.540 --> 1:50:00.980\n All the money and money like, oh my, what in the world?\n\n1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:03.260\n Roger said, let's go have dinner.\n\n1:50:03.260 --> 1:50:04.980\n And so we went to the little restaurant\n\n1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:07.260\n that we would normally, we would go to, you know,\n\n1:50:07.260 --> 1:50:09.140\n and he said, and don't you dare look\n\n1:50:09.140 --> 1:50:11.420\n on the right hand side of the menu.\n\n1:50:11.420 --> 1:50:13.940\n He said, just order anything you want.\n\n1:50:13.940 --> 1:50:17.900\n And it was just, as we were in the restaurant, you know,\n\n1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:19.820\n it was just, we were giddy about it.\n\n1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:22.900\n Yeah, I was giddy about it.\n\n1:50:22.900 --> 1:50:24.020\n And.\n\n1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:27.700\n Were you afraid that, I mean, did you think about the fact\n\n1:50:27.700 --> 1:50:32.700\n that it's illegal and Roger can end up in prison?\n\n1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:34.180\n Oh, yes.\n\n1:50:34.180 --> 1:50:35.580\n Did you guys talk about it?\n\n1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:38.620\n Well, I just, I kind of thought I was bulletproof.\n\n1:50:38.620 --> 1:50:39.940\n I mean, they didn't catch you.\n\n1:50:39.940 --> 1:50:41.700\n I thought if they didn't catch you, you was all right.\n\n1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:42.540\n And it was hard to get you.\n\n1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:45.460\n It was hard to catch you in the air.\n\n1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:48.020\n So you never thought, hard to catch you in the air.\n\n1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:48.860\n I like it.\n\n1:50:48.860 --> 1:50:52.420\n I didn't know that if your friend told on you\n\n1:50:52.420 --> 1:50:54.580\n five years later, you'd still go to prison.\n\n1:50:54.580 --> 1:50:55.660\n That was a problem.\n\n1:50:55.660 --> 1:50:56.900\n I didn't know that.\n\n1:50:56.900 --> 1:50:59.620\n Did you guys ever talk about walking away?\n\n1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:03.380\n I asked Roger to walk away.\n\n1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:06.700\n And he says, I can't, Mario, just now, you know.\n\n1:51:06.700 --> 1:51:09.820\n And then of course, the amount of people\n\n1:51:09.820 --> 1:51:14.540\n that he began to support, the family and the gifts and the.\n\n1:51:14.540 --> 1:51:15.380\n The deals.\n\n1:51:15.380 --> 1:51:17.700\n The deals, yes, the deals.\n\n1:51:17.700 --> 1:51:18.540\n Big ones.\n\n1:51:18.540 --> 1:51:20.580\n Yes, and then you always want to do,\n\n1:51:20.580 --> 1:51:22.860\n what do you do with the money?\n\n1:51:22.860 --> 1:51:26.620\n So you want to, I guess you clean it up\n\n1:51:26.620 --> 1:51:31.020\n or you want to invest in an enterprise or in a business.\n\n1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:33.060\n Well, it just doesn't work.\n\n1:51:33.060 --> 1:51:35.620\n They know the source of it and they take it and run.\n\n1:51:37.420 --> 1:51:38.380\n Every one of them.\n\n1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:39.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:40.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:40.300 --> 1:51:42.940\n But he was very generous, extremely generous\n\n1:51:42.940 --> 1:51:45.100\n and benevolent and.\n\n1:51:45.100 --> 1:51:48.180\n And when I started, I would ask about,\n\n1:51:48.180 --> 1:51:52.100\n I went to a lawyer and a good number of people\n\n1:51:52.100 --> 1:51:55.140\n in California at that time wanted to legalize marijuana\n\n1:51:55.140 --> 1:51:57.300\n back in 1973.\n\n1:51:57.300 --> 1:51:58.740\n And I went to a lawyer and I says,\n\n1:51:58.740 --> 1:52:00.820\n Mr. Lawyer, I put $100 on to say,\n\n1:52:00.820 --> 1:52:03.180\n what would they do if I caught me\n\n1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:04.660\n bringing marijuana across the border?\n\n1:52:04.660 --> 1:52:07.860\n He said, if you have a criminal record, I said, no,\n\n1:52:07.860 --> 1:52:10.820\n I've never had a speeding ticket, nothing,\n\n1:52:10.820 --> 1:52:12.700\n not even a traffic ticket.\n\n1:52:12.700 --> 1:52:15.020\n I said, he said, you work for the fire department?\n\n1:52:15.020 --> 1:52:15.860\n I said, no sir.\n\n1:52:15.860 --> 1:52:16.900\n I said, yes, sir.\n\n1:52:16.900 --> 1:52:18.940\n He said, you'll get probation.\n\n1:52:18.940 --> 1:52:22.140\n The worst you'll do is you'll get one year\n\n1:52:22.140 --> 1:52:24.020\n and you'll spend four months raking leaves\n\n1:52:24.020 --> 1:52:25.780\n on a military base.\n\n1:52:25.780 --> 1:52:28.100\n So my mother and my father died some years before\n\n1:52:28.100 --> 1:52:30.060\n and I brought mother and baby sister came out\n\n1:52:30.060 --> 1:52:31.860\n and I took them down to Disneyland\n\n1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:33.940\n and she said, what you doing, boy?\n\n1:52:33.940 --> 1:52:35.940\n I said, I'm hauling pot, mom.\n\n1:52:35.940 --> 1:52:36.780\n She said, how much you making?\n\n1:52:36.780 --> 1:52:39.220\n I said, I'm making $40,000 any day I want to go.\n\n1:52:40.180 --> 1:52:41.500\n And she said, what do they do if they catch you?\n\n1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:43.580\n And I told her, what the lawyer said.\n\n1:52:43.580 --> 1:52:45.260\n Four months at the most raking leaves,\n\n1:52:45.260 --> 1:52:46.500\n that's what do you think?\n\n1:52:46.500 --> 1:52:48.620\n She said, do you need a copilot, son?\n\n1:52:48.620 --> 1:52:51.260\n Yeah, money is money, yeah.\n\n1:52:54.480 --> 1:52:59.480\n So your relationship persevered through some big challenges.\n\n1:53:00.700 --> 1:53:04.380\n Is there advice you can give about what makes\n\n1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:07.240\n for a successful relationship?\n\n1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:12.240\n Oh, well, you know, I think the initial igniting,\n\n1:53:13.420 --> 1:53:17.140\n meeting someone, you know, that's the love.\n\n1:53:17.140 --> 1:53:17.980\n That's it.\n\n1:53:17.980 --> 1:53:22.420\n And that little fire, that fire just keeps burning\n\n1:53:22.420 --> 1:53:23.860\n and burning and burning.\n\n1:53:23.860 --> 1:53:26.300\n You can't put it out no matter what.\n\n1:53:26.300 --> 1:53:28.880\n It's the love fire.\n\n1:53:29.820 --> 1:53:31.500\n But it gets difficult.\n\n1:53:31.500 --> 1:53:33.560\n It's funny, the love fire.\n\n1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:35.620\n So you're saying the love fire is all it takes\n\n1:53:35.620 --> 1:53:37.180\n to persevere through the difficulty.\n\n1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:40.780\n Well, no, well, that's a huge part of it.\n\n1:53:40.780 --> 1:53:44.980\n And also I contribute my individual situation\n\n1:53:44.980 --> 1:53:49.980\n to in order to endure the prison years is my faith.\n\n1:53:52.300 --> 1:53:53.140\n Faith in God?\n\n1:53:53.140 --> 1:53:53.980\n Yes.\n\n1:53:54.980 --> 1:53:58.940\n And friends who were unconditionally still loved me\n\n1:53:58.940 --> 1:54:02.100\n no matter what, yes.\n\n1:54:02.100 --> 1:54:05.260\n So you had love around you in general.\n\n1:54:05.260 --> 1:54:07.780\n I did, and my children.\n\n1:54:07.780 --> 1:54:11.780\n They, you know, and that was a real purpose\n\n1:54:11.780 --> 1:54:13.900\n to guide them and to love them\n\n1:54:13.900 --> 1:54:17.660\n and to help them become citizens.\n\n1:54:19.380 --> 1:54:20.740\n What about you, Roger?\n\n1:54:20.740 --> 1:54:22.780\n What advice would you give?\n\n1:54:22.780 --> 1:54:23.620\n I just don't know how to do it,\n\n1:54:23.620 --> 1:54:26.540\n but I do know that you have to work on a relationship.\n\n1:54:26.540 --> 1:54:27.960\n Mara and I's had problems.\n\n1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:28.800\n I mean, we get really.\n\n1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:29.900\n You guys get in fights?\n\n1:54:29.900 --> 1:54:30.740\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:54:30.740 --> 1:54:34.180\n That's pretty regular, but not,\n\n1:54:34.180 --> 1:54:36.500\n they don't let them last long, you know,\n\n1:54:36.500 --> 1:54:38.700\n but certainly we are so different.\n\n1:54:38.700 --> 1:54:42.100\n We're the same, and yet we're so different, yeah.\n\n1:54:42.100 --> 1:54:43.080\n Like little stuff?\n\n1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:45.020\n Little stuff, yes.\n\n1:54:45.020 --> 1:54:48.140\n And it might be big, but I usually win her over, you know?\n\n1:54:49.420 --> 1:54:53.500\n But anyhow, I just feel like Mara was always there.\n\n1:54:53.500 --> 1:54:55.900\n It was like she was my anchor.\n\n1:54:55.900 --> 1:54:57.360\n I was coming home.\n\n1:54:57.360 --> 1:54:59.700\n I was always coming home to her and the children.\n\n1:54:59.700 --> 1:55:01.780\n And you can see throughout my life,\n\n1:55:01.780 --> 1:55:03.860\n I'm working on getting there.\n\n1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:05.660\n Are you afraid for his life, by the way?\n\n1:55:05.660 --> 1:55:06.740\n Oh, yes.\n\n1:55:06.740 --> 1:55:08.680\n Oh, yeah, there are times, yeah.\n\n1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:11.420\n But you know, I had faith in him.\n\n1:55:11.420 --> 1:55:13.420\n He was an excellent pilot.\n\n1:55:13.420 --> 1:55:14.720\n For example, I always said,\n\n1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:16.860\n Roger, if the ship's going down,\n\n1:55:16.860 --> 1:55:18.660\n I'm jumping in the lifeboat with you\n\n1:55:18.660 --> 1:55:20.620\n because I know we're going to get to shore.\n\n1:55:20.620 --> 1:55:21.660\n You will save us.\n\n1:55:21.660 --> 1:55:25.060\n And so I had that faith in him, you know?\n\n1:55:25.060 --> 1:55:27.920\n I mean, he's a man, but yet he's the one\n\n1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:29.780\n you want to get into the lifeboat with.\n\n1:55:29.780 --> 1:55:30.880\n Definitely.\n\n1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:34.460\n But then there is, you know, Pablo Escobar,\n\n1:55:34.460 --> 1:55:37.220\n one of the most dangerous humans in history,\n\n1:55:37.220 --> 1:55:39.140\n plus the U.S. government.\n\n1:55:39.140 --> 1:55:40.300\n Yep.\n\n1:55:40.300 --> 1:55:41.300\n Worst by far.\n\n1:55:43.300 --> 1:55:46.500\n Very difficult, very difficult to get away.\n\n1:55:48.180 --> 1:55:52.740\n In terms of your faith, how has your faith helped you\n\n1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:55.220\n to be the woman you are in this relationship\n\n1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:58.980\n and seeing love the way you see it?\n\n1:55:59.980 --> 1:56:02.620\n Well, I think my faith gives me hope.\n\n1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:04.380\n I have lots of hope.\n\n1:56:04.380 --> 1:56:09.380\n It helps me to dwell on the good side.\n\n1:56:09.420 --> 1:56:12.660\n You know, when I ever meet someone\n\n1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:14.820\n and there's some negative,\n\n1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:17.300\n I try to see why they are like that\n\n1:56:17.300 --> 1:56:19.300\n or what's the source of all that.\n\n1:56:19.300 --> 1:56:22.500\n And I try to pull out the good.\n\n1:56:22.500 --> 1:56:23.420\n I really do.\n\n1:56:23.420 --> 1:56:24.900\n Not that I'm a goody goody,\n\n1:56:24.900 --> 1:56:26.540\n but that's what your faith does.\n\n1:56:26.540 --> 1:56:29.820\n You know, you see them as God sees us.\n\n1:56:29.820 --> 1:56:30.660\n You know?\n\n1:56:31.540 --> 1:56:33.380\n How has he changed over the years?\n\n1:56:33.380 --> 1:56:34.220\n Roger?\n\n1:56:34.220 --> 1:56:35.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:35.060 --> 1:56:36.180\n He's still the same.\n\n1:56:36.180 --> 1:56:38.020\n Actually, I like him better now.\n\n1:56:39.380 --> 1:56:40.540\n He's a little calmer.\n\n1:56:40.540 --> 1:56:41.660\n Yeah, that's crazy.\n\n1:56:41.660 --> 1:56:42.860\n Oh, yes.\n\n1:56:42.860 --> 1:56:45.100\n And happy to be, you know, at home,\n\n1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:48.340\n or he'll say, Mari, I am just so happy\n\n1:56:48.340 --> 1:56:51.040\n to be with you here in this condominium.\n\n1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:51.900\n I'm content.\n\n1:56:51.900 --> 1:56:55.020\n Because I used to call him my homing pigeon.\n\n1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:56.340\n I just have to let him fly.\n\n1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:58.540\n I couldn't, you know, he has to fly,\n\n1:56:58.540 --> 1:56:59.900\n but he always came home.\n\n1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:06.900\n Do you think about the end of this ride, our mortality?\n\n1:57:06.900 --> 1:57:08.300\n Do you think about your death?\n\n1:57:08.300 --> 1:57:09.660\n I do.\n\n1:57:09.660 --> 1:57:13.820\n Particularly, I'm going to have a heart valve replacement\n\n1:57:13.820 --> 1:57:18.260\n in about seven days where I could not make it.\n\n1:57:18.260 --> 1:57:20.060\n You know, it's a very serious operation.\n\n1:57:20.060 --> 1:57:22.980\n And I think about that very much.\n\n1:57:22.980 --> 1:57:26.700\n And I ask for peace.\n\n1:57:26.700 --> 1:57:31.300\n I just lost my brother about 10 days ago, so unexpectedly.\n\n1:57:31.300 --> 1:57:33.300\n And that really put, you know,\n\n1:57:33.300 --> 1:57:35.860\n makes you think of your mortality.\n\n1:57:35.860 --> 1:57:36.700\n Are you afraid?\n\n1:57:38.580 --> 1:57:41.360\n Somewhat, and yet not.\n\n1:57:42.980 --> 1:57:43.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:45.220\n I want to live, Lex.\n\n1:57:45.220 --> 1:57:48.100\n I want to live, you know?\n\n1:57:48.100 --> 1:57:49.140\n This life is fun.\n\n1:57:49.140 --> 1:57:50.540\n Yes.\n\n1:57:50.540 --> 1:57:52.540\n Do you think about your death, Roger?\n\n1:57:52.540 --> 1:57:53.700\n I have visions.\n\n1:57:54.780 --> 1:57:57.900\n Visions, and they often happen very, very clear,\n\n1:57:57.900 --> 1:58:00.500\n like what I have seen in the future.\n\n1:58:00.500 --> 1:58:02.060\n Scientists might call it wormholes,\n\n1:58:02.060 --> 1:58:05.140\n or in the Old Testament they called it prophets,\n\n1:58:05.140 --> 1:58:08.240\n but I see sometimes into the future around the corner.\n\n1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:10.060\n It's clear as we're sitting right here.\n\n1:58:10.060 --> 1:58:11.700\n What's that look like?\n\n1:58:11.700 --> 1:58:12.540\n I was on a porch,\n\n1:58:12.540 --> 1:58:14.980\n and I believe I was in like Central America place.\n\n1:58:14.980 --> 1:58:18.220\n I was an old man with khaki pants and a white shirt.\n\n1:58:18.220 --> 1:58:22.140\n And it was a chair with a wide arms, and it was straight,\n\n1:58:22.140 --> 1:58:25.180\n and there was like the beams coming out above my head,\n\n1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:26.340\n and I'm on a porch.\n\n1:58:26.340 --> 1:58:27.660\n Bokunbi, yeah.\n\n1:58:27.660 --> 1:58:32.660\n And I come, I have out of the body experiences also.\n\n1:58:33.340 --> 1:58:35.100\n And I came out of my body,\n\n1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:37.340\n just, I just floated out of my body,\n\n1:58:37.340 --> 1:58:41.060\n and went into a veil, and like into a mist.\n\n1:58:41.060 --> 1:58:43.820\n And I believe that's probably why it happened.\n\n1:58:43.820 --> 1:58:47.180\n You talk about like it's in your past.\n\n1:58:47.180 --> 1:58:48.020\n This is your future.\n\n1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:49.120\n This is in my future.\n\n1:58:50.340 --> 1:58:52.260\n But this is something he has seen,\n\n1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:53.340\n you know, in the past. I've seen it in a vision.\n\n1:58:53.340 --> 1:58:55.040\n Yeah, in a vision. No, I know, but it's funny,\n\n1:58:55.040 --> 1:58:58.780\n just the tense you use, it happened,\n\n1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:00.660\n and yet it's something that will happen.\n\n1:59:00.660 --> 1:59:01.700\n Yes. Two.\n\n1:59:01.700 --> 1:59:03.060\n Both are true.\n\n1:59:03.060 --> 1:59:04.280\n It's just unbelievable that,\n\n1:59:04.280 --> 1:59:07.620\n and I don't know how many people have it, but I have it.\n\n1:59:07.620 --> 1:59:09.660\n I walked out of my body just like,\n\n1:59:09.660 --> 1:59:11.080\n just where I could come up to you and look,\n\n1:59:11.080 --> 1:59:12.180\n and set up on the radio.\n\n1:59:12.180 --> 1:59:13.780\n I used to be at work on the railroad,\n\n1:59:13.780 --> 1:59:15.180\n and I had them there.\n\n1:59:15.180 --> 1:59:16.420\n How do you explain that?\n\n1:59:16.420 --> 1:59:18.380\n What do you think, what the heck is going on\n\n1:59:18.380 --> 1:59:20.540\n in this universe that's possible?\n\n1:59:20.540 --> 1:59:23.180\n Oh, I don't know, but certainly,\n\n1:59:23.180 --> 1:59:25.180\n certainly a phenomenon which has happened.\n\n1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:28.580\n And there's a guy, Bill Monroe,\n\n1:59:28.580 --> 1:59:30.140\n that wrote the book on it, Out of the Body.\n\n1:59:30.140 --> 1:59:31.220\n He tells about it.\n\n1:59:31.220 --> 1:59:35.860\n And who was the guy that writes The Alchemist?\n\n1:59:35.860 --> 1:59:37.460\n Pablo Coelho.\n\n1:59:37.460 --> 1:59:39.480\n He has them also, just like that.\n\n1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:41.820\n And he tells about how it happens on him.\n\n1:59:41.820 --> 1:59:43.180\n Mine happened differently.\n\n1:59:43.180 --> 1:59:47.180\n But you certainly can come out of your body.\n\n1:59:48.180 --> 1:59:51.440\n What do you think the meaning of this life is,\n\n1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:55.860\n maybe from your faith,\n\n1:59:55.860 --> 1:59:59.220\n but also from just the amazing adventure\n\n1:59:59.220 --> 2:00:00.880\n that you lived through?\n\n2:00:00.880 --> 2:00:03.500\n How do you make sense of why the heck we're here?\n\n2:00:05.380 --> 2:00:06.900\n I don't know.\n\n2:00:06.900 --> 2:00:08.940\n It's just kind of like who you are.\n\n2:00:08.940 --> 2:00:11.020\n Even when I was a child, I was like,\n\n2:00:11.020 --> 2:00:12.620\n I'm different from other people.\n\n2:00:12.620 --> 2:00:15.140\n You know?\n\n2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:19.900\n And just as a boy, I was, like I had a...\n\n2:00:19.900 --> 2:00:22.000\n Could you put into words how you were different\n\n2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:22.840\n or it was just the feeling?\n\n2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:24.700\n Yeah, like my brother, I mean,\n\n2:00:24.700 --> 2:00:27.280\n he kept his hands clean and his shoes shining.\n\n2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:29.460\n Here I was barefooted catching a wild hog\n\n2:00:29.460 --> 2:00:32.820\n or a rattle on a horse trying to get it down.\n\n2:00:32.820 --> 2:00:36.260\n I saw pictures of you climbing a tree recently.\n\n2:00:36.260 --> 2:00:37.880\n When I first got out of prison,\n\n2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:39.340\n always something like that.\n\n2:00:40.580 --> 2:00:41.780\n So I don't know.\n\n2:00:41.780 --> 2:00:46.220\n It's just that, and I noticed that something about me\n\n2:00:46.220 --> 2:00:49.420\n is sometimes in prison, there'd be a knife fight.\n\n2:00:49.420 --> 2:00:51.780\n And people just, you see them rough guys\n\n2:00:51.780 --> 2:00:53.880\n that turn white from it.\n\n2:00:55.220 --> 2:00:56.920\n I just kind of almost like smile.\n\n2:00:56.920 --> 2:01:01.180\n I mean, if they come at me, I turn white and get away.\n\n2:01:01.180 --> 2:01:02.740\n But it doesn't bother, those things,\n\n2:01:02.740 --> 2:01:03.780\n they still didn't bother me.\n\n2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:05.560\n I just, prison didn't bother me.\n\n2:01:06.580 --> 2:01:08.220\n So you don't know what the heck the meaning is.\n\n2:01:08.220 --> 2:01:10.540\n You just know you're a bit different than the others.\n\n2:01:10.540 --> 2:01:11.380\n Yeah, I might be a little bit kooky.\n\n2:01:11.380 --> 2:01:16.380\n Well, maybe the whole point is you want to realize,\n\n2:01:18.100 --> 2:01:21.340\n you want to let that madness flourish,\n\n2:01:21.340 --> 2:01:23.320\n that uniqueness flourish.\n\n2:01:23.320 --> 2:01:24.300\n That's the whole point of life.\n\n2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:25.700\n We're all different in our,\n\n2:01:25.700 --> 2:01:28.100\n in very interesting little ways.\n\n2:01:28.100 --> 2:01:30.580\n And the more different you are, you want to let that,\n\n2:01:30.580 --> 2:01:33.780\n you want to let that become, you want to let it be its full.\n\n2:01:33.780 --> 2:01:37.380\n It's like a garden, all the different flowers.\n\n2:01:37.380 --> 2:01:39.620\n You did mention you weren't sure\n\n2:01:39.620 --> 2:01:41.260\n if there's a free will or not.\n\n2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:44.620\n Do you think it's all predetermined?\n\n2:01:44.620 --> 2:01:45.460\n Or do you think we make our choices?\n\n2:01:45.460 --> 2:01:47.300\n No, we definitely make our decisions.\n\n2:01:47.300 --> 2:01:49.500\n I just said, if it is, I hope that,\n\n2:01:49.500 --> 2:01:51.260\n but I know that we make our decisions.\n\n2:01:51.260 --> 2:01:52.580\n Yes, I agree.\n\n2:01:52.580 --> 2:01:55.140\n And I know that we are spirits\n\n2:01:55.140 --> 2:01:57.340\n that are living in this flesh.\n\n2:01:57.340 --> 2:01:59.760\n That's beyond a shadow of a doubt for me.\n\n2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:00.940\n If you walk out of your body\n\n2:02:00.940 --> 2:02:03.280\n and have out of body experience, you will know it.\n\n2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:05.700\n So the body is just the temporary container\n\n2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:06.540\n for something much bigger.\n\n2:02:06.540 --> 2:02:09.420\n The spirit lives on eternally with no beginning and no end.\n\n2:02:09.420 --> 2:02:11.620\n And that's hard to fathom.\n\n2:02:11.620 --> 2:02:12.980\n Yeah, this is just a little,\n\n2:02:12.980 --> 2:02:16.140\n this is a shell to contain that spirit.\n\n2:02:16.140 --> 2:02:18.620\n This is the way we work on earth.\n\n2:02:18.620 --> 2:02:20.100\n But yeah, I know it.\n\n2:02:20.100 --> 2:02:21.740\n I'm an eternal being.\n\n2:02:21.740 --> 2:02:22.580\n So are you.\n\n2:02:22.580 --> 2:02:26.660\n Do you think there's a why to it?\n\n2:02:26.660 --> 2:02:28.840\n Do you think there's a meaning to this life?\n\n2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:32.520\n Well, I think the why is beyond my capability\n\n2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:33.580\n of understanding.\n\n2:02:33.580 --> 2:02:36.020\n It's someone greater than me.\n\n2:02:36.020 --> 2:02:38.300\n I don't understand it,\n\n2:02:38.300 --> 2:02:40.220\n but it's awesome.\n\n2:02:40.220 --> 2:02:42.300\n I just know that it's awesome.\n\n2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:44.180\n And one day we will know the answers.\n\n2:02:44.180 --> 2:02:47.920\n Once we get to that crossover to the other side,\n\n2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:50.420\n I think we will understand clearly.\n\n2:02:50.420 --> 2:02:53.700\n It says, you know, now we see through a glass darkly,\n\n2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:56.100\n but then when we are face to face with God,\n\n2:02:56.100 --> 2:02:57.540\n we will understand.\n\n2:02:58.460 --> 2:03:03.460\n And until we know, let's just enjoy this beautiful life\n\n2:03:03.500 --> 2:03:04.340\n while we got it.\n\n2:03:04.340 --> 2:03:05.180\n Absolutely.\n\n2:03:05.180 --> 2:03:06.020\n And we're meant.\n\n2:03:06.020 --> 2:03:06.900\n That was my gift.\n\n2:03:06.900 --> 2:03:10.380\n I love everybody and everything I do.\n\n2:03:10.380 --> 2:03:12.100\n And it just, and I'm sorry,\n\n2:03:12.100 --> 2:03:14.440\n if I put a stumbling block in anybody's way,\n\n2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:16.020\n I wouldn't want to,\n\n2:03:16.020 --> 2:03:18.760\n but these are these things that when I just think about,\n\n2:03:18.760 --> 2:03:23.520\n oh, what a hypocritical world we live in though.\n\n2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:27.700\n Like most anybody, I'd say, listen, okay,\n\n2:03:27.700 --> 2:03:28.780\n he's a drug dealer.\n\n2:03:28.780 --> 2:03:31.380\n And I would say most of them had committed adultery.\n\n2:03:31.380 --> 2:03:33.300\n That's a cardinal sin.\n\n2:03:33.300 --> 2:03:38.300\n And yet they move, throw rocks at me for moving a marijuana,\n\n2:03:38.420 --> 2:03:40.020\n cocaine across the road.\n\n2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:40.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:40.860 --> 2:03:42.500\n It's just, if you saw the two different things,\n\n2:03:42.500 --> 2:03:45.760\n you'd say, what a terrible difference it is.\n\n2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:49.220\n But we become conditioned with this mad society\n\n2:03:49.220 --> 2:03:50.060\n that we have.\n\n2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:56.020\n You mentioned that your daughter, Miriam, wrote you a poem.\n\n2:03:56.020 --> 2:03:57.220\n Do you mind reading it?\n\n2:03:57.220 --> 2:03:58.320\n I'd be glad to.\n\n2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:02.100\n I was doing 11 years up in Lombok Penitentiary,\n\n2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:05.460\n maximum security prison for parole violation\n\n2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:08.120\n for possession of marijuana in 1977.\n\n2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:10.200\n They should have given me six months,\n\n2:04:10.200 --> 2:04:12.140\n but they gave me 11 years because they wanted me\n\n2:04:12.140 --> 2:04:14.500\n for what they call silent beef.\n\n2:04:14.500 --> 2:04:16.660\n Anyhow, while I was in that dungeon,\n\n2:04:16.660 --> 2:04:19.920\n I received a letter from my daughter, Miriam.\n\n2:04:21.260 --> 2:04:23.160\n It's called Daddy's Poem.\n\n2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:27.580\n A year ago, I became a poet when I wrote your birthday prose.\n\n2:04:27.580 --> 2:04:30.680\n And here I am today, ready to give it another go.\n\n2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:35.140\n First, I would like to wish you a very happy birthday to be\n\n2:04:35.140 --> 2:04:37.100\n and to thank you so very much\n\n2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:39.740\n for without you, I would not be me.\n\n2:04:39.740 --> 2:04:43.640\n Secondly, I want to say that your support has been immense.\n\n2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:48.460\n It has been true, honest, loving, and free of all pretense.\n\n2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:50.880\n Thirdly, it goes without saying,\n\n2:04:50.880 --> 2:04:53.640\n your love has surpassed all my wrongs\n\n2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:55.500\n and you always made me smile\n\n2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:57.380\n with one of your old country songs.\n\n2:04:57.380 --> 2:05:00.980\n I can remember on Cuervo, Daddy,\n\n2:05:00.980 --> 2:05:02.840\n with you holding me in your arms,\n\n2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:06.540\n as you sang Jim Reeves songs and talked about the farm.\n\n2:05:06.540 --> 2:05:08.380\n I can see you walking through the door\n\n2:05:08.380 --> 2:05:10.700\n from one of your travels far and wide\n\n2:05:10.700 --> 2:05:12.600\n and the thought of you coming home, Daddy,\n\n2:05:12.600 --> 2:05:15.060\n kept a twinkle in our eyes.\n\n2:05:15.060 --> 2:05:18.900\n I can smell you as I did when I used to climb into your bed\n\n2:05:18.900 --> 2:05:20.140\n and you would talk to me again\n\n2:05:20.140 --> 2:05:22.780\n about one of the adventures that you led.\n\n2:05:22.780 --> 2:05:24.600\n I can see me and Mario asleep\n\n2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:27.420\n in one of your airplanes extraordinaire\n\n2:05:27.420 --> 2:05:29.620\n and remembering wondering to myself\n\n2:05:29.620 --> 2:05:32.460\n why there wasn't an available chair.\n\n2:05:32.460 --> 2:05:34.100\n I remember having to meet you\n\n2:05:34.100 --> 2:05:36.140\n and worrying that you wouldn't be there,\n\n2:05:36.140 --> 2:05:38.740\n but you would pop from behind some counter\n\n2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:40.580\n and give us all a happy scare.\n\n2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:44.180\n You gave us presents in Key Biscayne\n\n2:05:44.180 --> 2:05:46.300\n and hotels pleasure galore\n\n2:05:46.300 --> 2:05:50.140\n and three dozen roses that we came through the airport door.\n\n2:05:50.140 --> 2:05:53.660\n I can see your face in Amsterdam with the luggage carousel\n\n2:05:53.660 --> 2:05:55.260\n and you look like a boy with a secret\n\n2:05:55.260 --> 2:05:57.900\n that you were just dying to tell.\n\n2:05:57.900 --> 2:06:01.420\n You taught me mathematics in the sands of far away places\n\n2:06:01.420 --> 2:06:04.940\n and taught me to sail and we left without any traces.\n\n2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:07.060\n We climbed glaciers in Argentina\n\n2:06:07.060 --> 2:06:09.420\n and saw the blue of the beautiful caves\n\n2:06:09.420 --> 2:06:14.200\n and witnessed the majestic beauty of such a juggling maze.\n\n2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:17.560\n I learned how to change gears on the dirt roads of Brazil.\n\n2:06:17.560 --> 2:06:21.940\n We ate hot dogs in Paraguay, a memory we smile over still.\n\n2:06:21.940 --> 2:06:24.420\n We talked about lions, elephants and bears\n\n2:06:24.420 --> 2:06:26.780\n on a Hacienda in Uruguay,\n\n2:06:26.780 --> 2:06:30.020\n but decided it was better if the Europe we did fly.\n\n2:06:30.020 --> 2:06:32.260\n Oh, the old world and all its luxury,\n\n2:06:32.260 --> 2:06:34.580\n what a good time it was.\n\n2:06:34.580 --> 2:06:37.040\n From South America to the Krosnopolsky,\n\n2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:39.220\n I think we fell in love.\n\n2:06:39.220 --> 2:06:44.220\n The European jaunt, well, it is considered a book in itself\n\n2:06:44.340 --> 2:06:46.340\n but it's a story about beauty and knowledge,\n\n2:06:46.340 --> 2:06:48.640\n suspense and worldly wealth.\n\n2:06:48.640 --> 2:06:50.020\n We went from Holland to Sweden,\n\n2:06:50.020 --> 2:06:52.180\n we went from France to Spain\n\n2:06:52.180 --> 2:06:54.660\n and I promise you I have no regrets.\n\n2:06:54.660 --> 2:06:57.420\n I would definitely do it all again.\n\n2:06:57.420 --> 2:06:59.740\n I would see the world with you anytime, sir.\n\n2:06:59.740 --> 2:07:01.660\n There's no doubt in my mind\n\n2:07:01.660 --> 2:07:03.780\n because being by your side, daddy,\n\n2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:06.940\n always ensures a wild good time.\n\n2:07:06.940 --> 2:07:10.260\n So our paths took a turn and we're back in the US of A,\n\n2:07:10.260 --> 2:07:13.340\n but life here isn't so bad and I'm plumb content to stay.\n\n2:07:14.460 --> 2:07:16.100\n I'm happy to be near you,\n\n2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:18.860\n although I'm not as close as I was before,\n\n2:07:18.860 --> 2:07:21.100\n but because of your love and encouragement,\n\n2:07:21.100 --> 2:07:23.640\n I've been able to open new doors.\n\n2:07:23.640 --> 2:07:25.700\n I'm grateful to be in school\n\n2:07:25.700 --> 2:07:28.420\n and I'm genuinely happy where I am.\n\n2:07:28.420 --> 2:07:30.600\n And I even like when you call and tell me to study\n\n2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:31.900\n for the next exam.\n\n2:07:32.740 --> 2:07:34.860\n What a life you've given me, daddy.\n\n2:07:34.860 --> 2:07:37.740\n It's a tremendous and a magical gift.\n\n2:07:37.740 --> 2:07:40.020\n We already have so many stories to tell,\n\n2:07:40.020 --> 2:07:42.340\n there are far too many to list.\n\n2:07:42.340 --> 2:07:44.540\n But I want to thank you again this day\n\n2:07:44.540 --> 2:07:47.180\n with a very big happy birthday to you\n\n2:07:47.180 --> 2:07:49.340\n and to tell you just a few more things\n\n2:07:49.340 --> 2:07:51.700\n that I knew in my heart to be true.\n\n2:07:51.700 --> 2:07:52.860\n That I love you, daddy,\n\n2:07:52.860 --> 2:07:55.380\n with all of your wrongs and your rights.\n\n2:07:55.380 --> 2:07:56.700\n That you're ahead of our family\n\n2:07:56.700 --> 2:07:59.300\n and you've kept us all bound tight.\n\n2:07:59.300 --> 2:08:01.340\n That you have a honest love in your heart\n\n2:08:01.340 --> 2:08:03.600\n for God and all mankind.\n\n2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:05.620\n And you truly do believe in yourself\n\n2:08:05.620 --> 2:08:08.340\n when you say it will all be fine.\n\n2:08:08.340 --> 2:08:10.340\n I know you will be there to catch me\n\n2:08:10.340 --> 2:08:12.660\n if ever I waver a slip\n\n2:08:12.660 --> 2:08:16.460\n and I know I'd want you as captain on any sinking ship.\n\n2:08:16.460 --> 2:08:19.020\n I also know a new chapter is written.\n\n2:08:19.020 --> 2:08:21.660\n It's almost time to move on.\n\n2:08:21.660 --> 2:08:23.220\n It's time to sail another sea\n\n2:08:23.220 --> 2:08:25.620\n and to witness a brand new dawn.\n\n2:08:25.620 --> 2:08:27.700\n It'd be good to see you at the helm again\n\n2:08:27.700 --> 2:08:29.860\n as you point out our destination,\n\n2:08:29.860 --> 2:08:32.140\n the laugh and dance on the upper deckers\n\n2:08:32.140 --> 2:08:33.700\n while the boat glides through.\n\n2:08:34.780 --> 2:08:36.780\n It'd be good to see you on the go\n\n2:08:36.780 --> 2:08:39.060\n as I know you like to be\n\n2:08:39.060 --> 2:08:42.540\n and to know you can open any door without any key.\n\n2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:45.820\n But while we revel in our days together,\n\n2:08:45.820 --> 2:08:47.960\n we will know better than to hurry\n\n2:08:47.960 --> 2:08:50.780\n because as you told me many times,\n\n2:08:50.780 --> 2:08:53.100\n life is an incredible journey.\n\n2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:55.820\n Wow, that's beautiful.\n\n2:08:57.700 --> 2:08:58.540\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:58.540 --> 2:09:02.540\n Roger, I'm really honored that you would take the time\n\n2:09:02.540 --> 2:09:06.700\n to visit me in Texas and to sit down and talk with me.\n\n2:09:06.700 --> 2:09:07.660\n Thank you so much, Roger.\n\n2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:08.500\n Thanks so much, Mary. Thank you.\n\n2:09:08.500 --> 2:09:10.180\n Thank you, it was a pleasure.\n\n2:09:10.180 --> 2:09:11.260\n It's been a real pleasure.\n\n2:09:11.260 --> 2:09:12.180\n Yes.\n\n2:09:12.180 --> 2:09:13.720\n Beautiful.\n\n2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:16.260\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Roger Reeves\n\n2:09:16.260 --> 2:09:20.740\n and thank you to Noom, Allform, ExpressVPN,\n\n2:09:20.740 --> 2:09:23.240\n Four Sigmatic and 8sleep.\n\n2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:26.940\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n2:09:26.940 --> 2:09:29.020\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:09:29.020 --> 2:09:31.220\n from Pablo Escobar.\n\n2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:35.520\n All empires are created of blood and fire.\n\n2:09:36.660 --> 2:09:37.640\n Thank you for listening.\n\n2:09:37.640 --> 2:09:47.640\n I hope to see you next time.\n\n"
