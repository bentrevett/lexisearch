00:07.480\n and perhaps one of the most famous\n\n00:07.480 --> 00:10.600\n and impactful teachers of math in the world.\n\n00:10.600 --> 00:13.640\n His MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on linear algebra\n\n00:13.640 --> 00:15.920\n have been viewed millions of times.\n\n00:15.920 --> 00:17.480\n As an undergraduate student,\n\n00:17.480 --> 00:19.960\n I was one of those millions of students.\n\n00:19.960 --> 00:22.760\n There's something inspiring about the way he teaches.\n\n00:22.760 --> 00:26.120\n There's at once calm, simple, and yet full of passion\n\n00:26.120 --> 00:29.080\n for the elegance inherent to mathematics.\n\n00:29.080 --> 00:31.200\n I remember doing the exercise in his book,\n\n00:31.200 --> 00:33.000\n Introduction to Linear Algebra,\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:35.880\n and slowly realizing that the world of matrices,\n\n00:35.880 --> 00:39.360\n of vector spaces, of determinants and eigenvalues,\n\n00:39.360 --> 00:43.040\n of geometric transformations and matrix decompositions\n\n00:43.040 --> 00:45.120\n reveal a set of powerful tools\n\n00:45.120 --> 00:47.920\n in the toolbox of artificial intelligence.\n\n00:47.920 --> 00:49.720\n From signals to images,\n\n00:49.720 --> 00:51.920\n from numerical optimization to robotics,\n\n00:51.920 --> 00:54.880\n computer vision, deep learning, computer graphics,\n\n00:54.880 --> 00:56.600\n and everywhere outside AI,\n\n00:56.600 --> 01:00.080\n including, of course, a quantum mechanical study\n\n01:00.080 --> 01:01.520\n of our universe.\n\n01:01.520 --> 01:04.440\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:04.440 --> 01:06.840\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:06.840 --> 01:08.880\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n01:08.880 --> 01:10.240\n support on Patreon,\n\n01:10.240 --> 01:12.360\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:12.360 --> 01:15.520\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:16.440 --> 01:19.040\n This podcast is supported by ZipRecruiter.\n\n01:19.040 --> 01:21.200\n Hiring great people is hard,\n\n01:21.200 --> 01:23.280\n and to me is the most important element\n\n01:23.280 --> 01:26.080\n of a successful mission driven team.\n\n01:26.080 --> 01:28.120\n I've been fortunate to be a part of\n\n01:28.120 --> 01:30.720\n and to lead several great engineering teams.\n\n01:30.720 --> 01:32.680\n The hiring I've done in the past\n\n01:32.680 --> 01:35.400\n was mostly through tools that we built ourselves,\n\n01:35.400 --> 01:38.400\n but reinventing the wheel was painful.\n\n01:38.400 --> 01:41.240\n ZipRecruiter is a tool that's already available for you.\n\n01:41.240 --> 01:45.000\n It seeks to make hiring simple, fast, and smart.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:47.960\n For example, Codable cofounder Gretchen Huebner\n\n01:47.960 --> 01:50.400\n used ZipRecruiter to find a new game artist\n\n01:50.400 --> 01:52.720\n to join her education tech company.\n\n01:52.720 --> 01:54.840\n By using ZipRecruiter's screening questions\n\n01:54.840 --> 01:56.280\n to filter candidates,\n\n01:56.280 --> 01:59.080\n Gretchen found it easier to focus on the best candidates\n\n01:59.080 --> 02:02.440\n and finally hiring the perfect person for the role\n\n02:02.440 --> 02:05.440\n in less than two weeks from start to finish.\n\n02:05.440 --> 02:08.560\n ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.\n\n02:08.560 --> 02:10.200\n See why ZipRecruiter is effective\n\n02:10.200 --> 02:12.680\n for businesses of all sizes by signing up,\n\n02:12.680 --> 02:17.600\n as I did, for free at ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.\n\n02:17.600 --> 02:21.360\n That's ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.\n\n02:22.280 --> 02:24.360\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n02:24.360 --> 02:26.880\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n02:26.880 --> 02:29.640\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n02:29.640 --> 02:33.080\n but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.\n\n02:33.080 --> 02:34.880\n Most Bitcoin exchanges take days\n\n02:34.880 --> 02:37.120\n for a bank transfer to become investable.\n\n02:37.120 --> 02:39.480\n Through Cash App, it takes seconds.\n\n02:39.480 --> 02:42.840\n Cash App also has a new investing feature.\n\n02:42.840 --> 02:44.600\n You can buy fractions of a stock,\n\n02:44.600 --> 02:47.320\n which to me is a really interesting concept.\n\n02:47.320 --> 02:51.600\n So you can buy $1 worth no matter what the stock price is.\n\n02:51.600 --> 02:54.520\n Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n02:54.520 --> 02:58.320\n a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.\n\n02:58.320 --> 03:00.120\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n03:00.120 --> 03:02.800\n to support one of my favorite organizations\n\n03:02.800 --> 03:05.720\n that many of you may know and have benefited from,\n\n03:05.720 --> 03:09.200\n called First, best known for their first robotics\n\n03:09.200 --> 03:10.840\n and Lego competitions.\n\n03:10.840 --> 03:14.560\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n03:14.560 --> 03:16.520\n in over 110 countries,\n\n03:16.520 --> 03:19.000\n and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.600\n which means the donated money is used\n\n03:21.600 --> 03:23.920\n to maximum effectiveness.\n\n03:23.920 --> 03:26.920\n When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play,\n\n03:26.920 --> 03:29.400\n and use code LexPodcast,\n\n03:29.400 --> 03:33.200\n you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,\n\n03:33.200 --> 03:35.200\n which again, is an organization\n\n03:35.200 --> 03:38.000\n that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\n to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.740\n And now, here's my conversation with Gilbert Strang.\n\n03:44.740 --> 03:49.740\n How does it feel to be one of the modern day rock stars\n\n03:50.500 --> 03:51.760\n of mathematics?\n\n03:51.760 --> 03:53.900\n I don't feel like a rock star.\n\n03:53.900 --> 03:57.340\n That's kind of crazy for an old math person.\n\n03:57.340 --> 04:02.340\n But it's true that the videos in linear algebra\n\n04:03.540 --> 04:07.180\n that I made way back in 2000, I think,\n\n04:08.540 --> 04:09.880\n have been watched a lot.\n\n04:09.880 --> 04:14.420\n And well, partly the importance of linear algebra,\n\n04:14.420 --> 04:15.940\n which I'm sure you'll ask me,\n\n04:15.940 --> 04:19.220\n and give me a chance to say that linear algebra\n\n04:19.220 --> 04:22.580\n as a subject has just surged in importance.\n\n04:22.580 --> 04:26.460\n But also, it was a class that I taught a bunch of times,\n\n04:26.460 --> 04:31.460\n so I kind of got it organized and enjoyed doing it.\n\n04:32.220 --> 04:34.180\n The videos were just the class.\n\n04:34.180 --> 04:36.740\n So they're on OpenCourseWare and on YouTube\n\n04:36.740 --> 04:38.900\n and translated, and it's fun.\n\n04:38.900 --> 04:41.100\n But there's something about that chalkboard\n\n04:41.100 --> 04:44.460\n and the simplicity of the way you explain\n\n04:44.460 --> 04:46.820\n the basic concepts in the beginning.\n\n04:46.820 --> 04:50.440\n To be honest, when I went to undergrad.\n\n04:50.440 --> 04:52.660\n You didn't do linear algebra, probably.\n\n04:52.660 --> 04:53.980\n Of course I didn't do linear algebra.\n\n04:53.980 --> 04:54.820\n You did.\n\n04:54.820 --> 04:55.640\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.\n\n04:55.640 --> 05:00.640\n But before going through the course at my university,\n\n05:00.940 --> 05:02.540\n there was going through OpenCourseWare.\n\n05:02.540 --> 05:04.620\n You were my instructor for linear algebra.\n\n05:04.620 --> 05:05.500\n Right, yeah.\n\n05:05.500 --> 05:07.560\n And that, I mean, we're using your book.\n\n05:07.560 --> 05:12.560\n And I mean, the fact that there is thousands,\n\n05:13.100 --> 05:14.860\n hundreds of thousands, millions of people\n\n05:14.860 --> 05:18.260\n that watch that video, I think that's really powerful.\n\n05:18.260 --> 05:23.260\n So how do you think the idea of putting lectures online,\n\n05:23.700 --> 05:27.260\n what really MIT OpenCourseWare has innovated?\n\n05:27.260 --> 05:29.140\n That was a wonderful idea.\n\n05:29.140 --> 05:34.140\n I think the story that I've heard is the committee\n\n05:34.140 --> 05:37.740\n was appointed by the president, President Vest,\n\n05:37.740 --> 05:40.020\n at that time, a wonderful guy.\n\n05:40.020 --> 05:43.500\n And the idea of the committee was to figure out\n\n05:43.500 --> 05:48.500\n how MIT could be like other universities,\n\n05:48.660 --> 05:52.620\n market the work we were doing.\n\n05:52.620 --> 05:54.500\n And then they didn't see a way.\n\n05:54.500 --> 05:57.300\n And after a weekend, and they had an inspiration,\n\n05:57.300 --> 06:00.020\n came back to President Vest and said,\n\n06:00.020 --> 06:02.260\n what if we just gave it away?\n\n06:02.260 --> 06:07.260\n And he decided that was okay, good idea.\n\n06:07.700 --> 06:08.540\n So.\n\n06:08.540 --> 06:10.660\n You know, that's a crazy idea.\n\n06:10.660 --> 06:12.740\n If we think of a university as a thing\n\n06:12.740 --> 06:16.060\n that creates a product, isn't knowledge,\n\n06:17.780 --> 06:19.580\n the kind of educational knowledge,\n\n06:19.580 --> 06:22.660\n isn't the product and giving that away,\n\n06:22.660 --> 06:26.140\n are you surprised that it went through?\n\n06:26.140 --> 06:28.300\n The result that he did it,\n\n06:28.300 --> 06:32.300\n well, knowing a little bit President Vest, it was like him,\n\n06:32.300 --> 06:36.420\n I think, and it was really the right idea.\n\n06:38.780 --> 06:43.220\n MIT is a kind of, it's known for being high level,\n\n06:43.220 --> 06:48.220\n technical things, and this is the best way we can say,\n\n06:48.300 --> 06:52.580\n tell, we can show what MIT really is like,\n\n06:52.580 --> 06:57.380\n because in my case, those 1806 videos\n\n06:57.380 --> 06:59.940\n are just teaching the class.\n\n06:59.940 --> 07:03.660\n They were there in 26, 100.\n\n07:03.660 --> 07:04.860\n They're kind of fun to look at.\n\n07:04.860 --> 07:08.300\n People write to me and say, oh, you've got a sense of humor,\n\n07:08.300 --> 07:10.940\n but I don't know where that comes through.\n\n07:10.940 --> 07:15.140\n Somehow I'm friendly with the class, I like students.\n\n07:15.140 --> 07:19.260\n And then your algebra, the subject,\n\n07:19.260 --> 07:21.700\n we gotta give the subject most of the credit.\n\n07:21.700 --> 07:26.700\n It really has come forward in importance in these years.\n\n07:29.980 --> 07:32.740\n So let's talk about linear algebra a little bit,\n\n07:32.740 --> 07:34.580\n because it is such a, it's both a powerful\n\n07:34.580 --> 07:39.100\n and a beautiful subfield of mathematics.\n\n07:39.100 --> 07:44.100\n So what's your favorite specific topic in linear algebra,\n\n07:44.300 --> 07:46.620\n or even math in general to give a lecture on,\n\n07:46.620 --> 07:50.220\n to convey, to tell a story, to teach students?\n\n07:50.220 --> 07:53.460\n Okay, well, on the teaching side,\n\n07:54.500 --> 07:56.820\n so it's not deep mathematics at all,\n\n07:56.820 --> 08:01.820\n but I'm kind of proud of the idea of the four subspaces,\n\n08:02.380 --> 08:05.180\n the four fundamental subspaces,\n\n08:06.460 --> 08:09.660\n which are of course known before,\n\n08:09.660 --> 08:13.660\n long before my name for them, but.\n\n08:13.660 --> 08:14.700\n Can you go through them?\n\n08:14.700 --> 08:15.540\n Can you go through the four subspaces?\n\n08:15.540 --> 08:17.020\n Sure I can, yeah.\n\n08:17.020 --> 08:19.660\n So the first one to understand is,\n\n08:19.660 --> 08:22.900\n so the matrix is, maybe I should say the matrix is.\n\n08:22.900 --> 08:23.780\n What is a matrix?\n\n08:23.780 --> 08:24.860\n What's a matrix?\n\n08:24.860 --> 08:28.500\n Well, so we have like a rectangle of numbers.\n\n08:28.500 --> 08:32.220\n So it's got n columns, got a bunch of columns,\n\n08:32.220 --> 08:36.500\n and also got an m rows, let's say,\n\n08:36.500 --> 08:37.940\n and the relation between,\n\n08:37.940 --> 08:39.860\n so of course the columns and the rows,\n\n08:39.860 --> 08:41.580\n it's the same numbers.\n\n08:41.580 --> 08:44.340\n So there's gotta be connections there,\n\n08:44.340 --> 08:45.660\n but they're not simple.\n\n08:45.660 --> 08:50.060\n The columns might be longer than the rows,\n\n08:50.060 --> 08:53.700\n and they're all different, the numbers are mixed up.\n\n08:53.700 --> 08:57.740\n First space to think about is take the columns,\n\n08:57.740 --> 09:01.860\n so those are vectors, those are points in n dimensions.\n\n09:01.860 --> 09:02.700\n What's a vector?\n\n09:02.700 --> 09:05.660\n So a physicist would imagine a vector\n\n09:05.660 --> 09:10.660\n or might imagine a vector as a arrow in space\n\n09:10.860 --> 09:14.820\n or the point it ends at in space.\n\n09:14.820 --> 09:17.260\n For me, it's a column of numbers.\n\n09:18.300 --> 09:20.940\n You often think of, this is very interesting\n\n09:20.940 --> 09:23.940\n in terms of linear algebra, in terms of a vector,\n\n09:23.940 --> 09:26.660\n you think a little bit more abstract\n\n09:26.660 --> 09:30.660\n than how it's very commonly used, perhaps.\n\n09:30.660 --> 09:34.700\n You think this arbitrary multidimensional space.\n\n09:34.700 --> 09:38.180\n Right away, I'm in high dimensions.\n\n09:38.180 --> 09:39.020\n Dreamland.\n\n09:39.020 --> 09:40.060\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n09:40.060 --> 09:42.420\n In the lecture, I try to,\n\n09:42.420 --> 09:46.780\n so if you think of two vectors in 10 dimensions,\n\n09:46.780 --> 09:50.420\n I'll do this in class, and I'll readily admit\n\n09:50.420 --> 09:54.380\n that I have no good image in my mind\n\n09:54.380 --> 09:58.260\n of a vector of an arrow in 10 dimensional space,\n\n09:58.260 --> 09:59.220\n but whatever.\n\n10:00.700 --> 10:03.780\n You can add one bunch of 10 numbers\n\n10:03.780 --> 10:05.300\n to another bunch of 10 numbers,\n\n10:05.300 --> 10:08.060\n so you can add a vector to a vector,\n\n10:08.060 --> 10:10.300\n and you can multiply a vector by three,\n\n10:10.300 --> 10:12.180\n and that's, if you know how to do those,\n\n10:12.180 --> 10:14.380\n you've got linear algebra.\n\n10:14.380 --> 10:18.860\n 10 dimensions, there's this beautiful thing about math,\n\n10:18.860 --> 10:21.700\n if we look at string theory and all these theories,\n\n10:21.700 --> 10:24.460\n which are really fundamentally derived through math,\n\n10:24.460 --> 10:26.500\n but are very difficult to visualize.\n\n10:26.500 --> 10:28.900\n How do you think about the things,\n\n10:28.900 --> 10:31.140\n like a 10 dimensional vector,\n\n10:31.140 --> 10:33.020\n that we can't really visualize?\n\n10:34.780 --> 10:39.780\n And yet, math reveals some beauty underlying our world\n\n10:39.780 --> 10:43.820\n in that weird thing we can't visualize.\n\n10:43.820 --> 10:46.020\n How do you think about that difference?\n\n10:46.020 --> 10:48.900\n Well, probably, I'm not a very geometric person,\n\n10:48.900 --> 10:51.700\n so I'm probably thinking in three dimensions,\n\n10:51.700 --> 10:53.940\n and the beauty of linear algebra is that\n\n10:55.500 --> 10:58.180\n it goes on to 10 dimensions with no problem.\n\n10:58.180 --> 11:01.220\n I mean, that if you're just seeing what happens\n\n11:01.220 --> 11:04.580\n if you add two vectors in 3D,\n\n11:04.580 --> 11:06.460\n yeah, then you can add them in 10D.\n\n11:06.460 --> 11:10.900\n You're just adding the 10 components.\n\n11:10.900 --> 11:14.860\n So, I can't say that I have a picture,\n\n11:14.860 --> 11:16.860\n but yet I try to push the class\n\n11:16.860 --> 11:21.220\n to think of a flat surface in 10 dimensions.\n\n11:21.220 --> 11:23.420\n So a plane in 10 dimensions,\n\n11:23.420 --> 11:27.180\n and so that's one of the spaces.\n\n11:27.180 --> 11:29.900\n Take all the columns of the matrix,\n\n11:29.900 --> 11:31.820\n take all their combinations,\n\n11:31.820 --> 11:35.180\n so much of this column, so much of this one,\n\n11:35.180 --> 11:36.820\n then if you put all those together,\n\n11:36.820 --> 11:39.940\n you get some kind of a flat surface\n\n11:39.940 --> 11:44.700\n that I call a vector space, space of vectors.\n\n11:44.700 --> 11:47.260\n And my imagination is just seeing\n\n11:47.260 --> 11:52.260\n like a piece of paper in 3D, but anyway,\n\n11:52.500 --> 11:55.940\n so that's one of the spaces, that's space number one,\n\n11:55.940 --> 11:58.460\n the column space of the matrix.\n\n11:58.460 --> 12:01.580\n And then there's the row space, which is, as I said,\n\n12:01.580 --> 12:04.740\n different, but came from the same numbers.\n\n12:04.740 --> 12:07.100\n So we got the column space,\n\n12:07.100 --> 12:10.040\n all combinations of the columns,\n\n12:10.040 --> 12:11.960\n and then we've got the row space,\n\n12:11.960 --> 12:14.580\n all combinations of the rows.\n\n12:14.580 --> 12:17.520\n So those words are easy for me to say,\n\n12:17.520 --> 12:20.240\n and I can't really draw them on a blackboard,\n\n12:20.240 --> 12:22.540\n but I try with my thick chalk.\n\n12:22.540 --> 12:27.380\n Everybody likes that railroad chalk, and me too.\n\n12:27.380 --> 12:30.220\n I wouldn't use anything else now.\n\n12:30.220 --> 12:35.060\n And then the other two spaces are perpendicular to those.\n\n12:35.060 --> 12:39.100\n So like if you have a plane in 3D,\n\n12:39.100 --> 12:43.500\n just a plane is just a flat surface in 3D,\n\n12:43.500 --> 12:47.060\n then perpendicular to that plane would be a line.\n\n12:47.060 --> 12:50.200\n So that would be the null space.\n\n12:50.200 --> 12:54.000\n So we've got two, we've got a column space, a row space,\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.940\n and there are two perpendicular spaces.\n\n12:56.940 --> 13:01.540\n So those four fit together in a beautiful picture\n\n13:01.540 --> 13:03.740\n of a matrix, yeah, yeah.\n\n13:03.740 --> 13:06.740\n It's sort of a fundamental, it's not a difficult idea.\n\n13:06.740 --> 13:11.240\n It comes pretty early in 1806, and it's basic.\n\n13:12.740 --> 13:16.380\n Planes in these multidimensional spaces,\n\n13:16.380 --> 13:20.140\n how difficult of an idea is that to come to, do you think?\n\n13:20.140 --> 13:23.620\n If you look back in time,\n\n13:23.620 --> 13:26.820\n I think mathematically it makes sense,\n\n13:26.820 --> 13:29.600\n but I don't know if it's intuitive for us to imagine,\n\n13:29.600 --> 13:31.100\n just as we were talking about.\n\n13:31.100 --> 13:34.800\n It feels like calculus is easier to intuit.\n\n13:34.800 --> 13:38.400\n Well, I have to admit, calculus came earlier,\n\n13:38.400 --> 13:39.860\n earlier than linear algebra.\n\n13:39.860 --> 13:42.180\n So Newton and Leibniz were the great men\n\n13:42.180 --> 13:45.800\n to understand the key ideas of calculus.\n\n13:47.100 --> 13:50.100\n But linear algebra to me is like, okay,\n\n13:50.100 --> 13:51.620\n it's the starting point,\n\n13:51.620 --> 13:54.180\n because it's all about flat things.\n\n13:54.180 --> 13:57.160\n Calculus has got, all the complications of calculus\n\n13:57.160 --> 14:02.160\n come from the curves, the bending, the curved surfaces.\n\n14:03.060 --> 14:05.900\n Linear algebra, the surfaces are all flat.\n\n14:05.900 --> 14:08.060\n Nothing bends in linear algebra.\n\n14:08.060 --> 14:11.660\n So it should have come first, but it didn't.\n\n14:11.660 --> 14:16.660\n And calculus also comes first in high school classes,\n\n14:17.440 --> 14:20.900\n in college class, it'll be freshman math,\n\n14:20.900 --> 14:24.340\n it'll be calculus, and then I say, enough of it.\n\n14:24.340 --> 14:27.820\n Like, okay, get to the good stuff.\n\n14:27.820 --> 14:28.660\n And that's...\n\n14:28.660 --> 14:30.900\n Do you think linear algebra should come first?\n\n14:30.900 --> 14:34.700\n Well, it really, I'm okay with it not coming first,\n\n14:34.700 --> 14:37.100\n but it should, yeah, it should.\n\n14:37.100 --> 14:38.040\n It's simpler.\n\n14:39.060 --> 14:40.180\n Because everything is flat.\n\n14:40.180 --> 14:41.660\n Yeah, everything's flat.\n\n14:41.660 --> 14:43.580\n Well, of course, for that reason,\n\n14:43.580 --> 14:46.620\n calculus sort of sticks to one dimension,\n\n14:46.620 --> 14:49.500\n or eventually you do multivariate,\n\n14:49.500 --> 14:52.260\n but that basically means two dimensions.\n\n14:52.260 --> 14:55.500\n Linear algebra, you take off into 10 dimensions, no problem.\n\n14:55.500 --> 14:57.620\n It just feels scary and dangerous\n\n14:57.620 --> 14:59.840\n to go beyond two dimensions, that's all.\n\n15:01.100 --> 15:03.700\n If everything's flat, you can't go wrong.\n\n15:03.700 --> 15:08.700\n So what concept or theorem in linear algebra or in math\n\n15:09.780 --> 15:12.700\n you find most beautiful,\n\n15:12.700 --> 15:15.420\n that gives you pause that leaves you in awe?\n\n15:15.420 --> 15:18.060\n Well, I'll stick with linear algebra here.\n\n15:18.060 --> 15:20.700\n I hope the viewer knows that really,\n\n15:20.700 --> 15:23.420\n mathematics is amazing, amazing subject\n\n15:23.420 --> 15:28.420\n and deep, deep connections between ideas\n\n15:28.740 --> 15:32.620\n that didn't look connected, they turned out they were.\n\n15:32.620 --> 15:35.580\n But if we stick with linear algebra...\n\n15:35.580 --> 15:37.060\n So we have a matrix.\n\n15:37.060 --> 15:40.740\n That's like the basic thing, a rectangle of numbers.\n\n15:40.740 --> 15:42.660\n And it might be a rectangle of data.\n\n15:42.660 --> 15:46.740\n You're probably gonna ask me later about data science,\n\n15:46.740 --> 15:50.380\n where often data comes in a matrix.\n\n15:50.380 --> 15:55.380\n You have maybe every column corresponds to a drug\n\n15:57.420 --> 16:00.380\n and every row corresponds to a patient.\n\n16:00.380 --> 16:05.380\n And if the patient reacted favorably to the drug,\n\n16:06.580 --> 16:09.180\n then you put up some positive number in there.\n\n16:09.180 --> 16:14.180\n Anyway, rectangle of numbers, a matrix is basic.\n\n16:14.180 --> 16:18.140\n So the big problem is to understand all those numbers.\n\n16:18.140 --> 16:20.980\n You got a big, big set of numbers.\n\n16:20.980 --> 16:23.660\n And what are the patterns, what's going on?\n\n16:23.660 --> 16:28.660\n And so one of the ways to break down that matrix\n\n16:29.780 --> 16:34.780\n into simple pieces is uses something called singular values.\n\n16:36.100 --> 16:41.100\n And that's come on as fundamental in the last,\n\n16:41.100 --> 16:44.540\n certainly in my lifetime.\n\n16:44.540 --> 16:48.500\n Eigenvalues, if you have viewers who've done engineering,\n\n16:48.500 --> 16:53.500\n math, or basic linear algebra, eigenvalues were in there.\n\n16:55.620 --> 16:58.780\n But those are restricted to square matrices.\n\n16:58.780 --> 17:01.340\n And data comes in rectangular matrices.\n\n17:01.340 --> 17:04.380\n So you gotta take that next step.\n\n17:04.380 --> 17:09.380\n I'm always pushing math faculty, get on, do it, do it.\n\n17:09.380 --> 17:11.180\n Singular values.\n\n17:11.180 --> 17:16.180\n So those are a way to break, to find the important pieces\n\n17:18.540 --> 17:22.140\n of the matrix, which add up to the whole matrix.\n\n17:22.140 --> 17:26.100\n So you're breaking a matrix into simple pieces.\n\n17:26.100 --> 17:30.300\n And the first piece is the most important part of the data.\n\n17:30.300 --> 17:33.100\n The second piece is the second most important part.\n\n17:33.100 --> 17:38.100\n And then often, so a data set is a matrix.\n\n17:38.100 --> 17:41.540\n And often, so a data scientist will like,\n\n17:41.540 --> 17:46.540\n if a data scientist can find those first and second pieces,\n\n17:46.820 --> 17:51.820\n stop there, the rest of the data is probably round off,\n\n17:55.660 --> 17:57.660\n experimental error maybe.\n\n17:57.660 --> 18:00.180\n So you're looking for the important part.\n\n18:00.180 --> 18:03.020\n So what do you find beautiful about singular values?\n\n18:03.020 --> 18:06.260\n Well, yeah, I didn't give the theorem.\n\n18:06.260 --> 18:09.420\n So here's the idea of singular values.\n\n18:09.420 --> 18:14.420\n Every matrix, every matrix, rectangular, square, whatever,\n\n18:15.180 --> 18:16.980\n can be written as a product\n\n18:16.980 --> 18:20.020\n of three very simple special matrices.\n\n18:20.020 --> 18:21.340\n So that's the theorem.\n\n18:21.340 --> 18:26.220\n Every matrix can be written as a rotation times a stretch,\n\n18:26.220 --> 18:30.340\n which is just a diagonal matrix,\n\n18:30.340 --> 18:34.220\n otherwise all zeros except on the one diagonal.\n\n18:34.220 --> 18:37.980\n And then the third factor is another rotation.\n\n18:37.980 --> 18:41.420\n So rotation, stretch, rotation\n\n18:41.420 --> 18:45.940\n is the breakup of any matrix.\n\n18:45.940 --> 18:48.420\n The structure of that, the ability that you can do that,\n\n18:48.420 --> 18:49.860\n what do you find appealing?\n\n18:49.860 --> 18:51.060\n What do you find beautiful about it?\n\n18:51.060 --> 18:54.220\n Well, geometrically, as I freely admit,\n\n18:54.220 --> 18:59.220\n the action of a matrix is not so easy to visualize,\n\n18:59.620 --> 19:02.380\n but everybody can visualize a rotation.\n\n19:02.380 --> 19:07.060\n Take two dimensional space and just turn it\n\n19:07.060 --> 19:09.260\n around the center.\n\n19:09.260 --> 19:10.740\n Take three dimensional space.\n\n19:10.740 --> 19:13.220\n So a pilot has to know about,\n\n19:13.220 --> 19:16.860\n well, what are the three, the yaw is one of them.\n\n19:16.860 --> 19:20.780\n I've forgotten all the three turns that a pilot makes.\n\n19:22.260 --> 19:25.460\n Up to 10 dimensions, you've got 10 ways to turn,\n\n19:25.460 --> 19:28.540\n but you can visualize a rotation.\n\n19:28.540 --> 19:30.300\n Take the space and turn it.\n\n19:30.300 --> 19:32.100\n And you can visualize a stretch.\n\n19:32.100 --> 19:37.100\n So to break a matrix with all those numbers in it\n\n19:38.660 --> 19:41.100\n into something you can visualize,\n\n19:41.100 --> 19:44.860\n rotate, stretch, rotate is pretty neat.\n\n19:44.860 --> 19:45.740\n It's pretty neat.\n\n19:45.740 --> 19:47.660\n That's pretty powerful.\n\n19:47.660 --> 19:51.980\n On YouTube, just consuming a bunch of videos\n\n19:51.980 --> 19:53.980\n and just watching what people connect with\n\n19:53.980 --> 19:57.300\n and what they really enjoy and are inspired by,\n\n19:57.300 --> 19:59.580\n math seems to come up again and again.\n\n19:59.580 --> 20:03.940\n I'm trying to understand why that is.\n\n20:03.940 --> 20:06.500\n Perhaps you can help give me clues.\n\n20:06.500 --> 20:10.740\n So it's not just the kinds of lectures that you give,\n\n20:10.740 --> 20:14.180\n but it's also just other folks like with Numberphile,\n\n20:14.180 --> 20:16.940\n there's a channel where they just chat about things\n\n20:16.940 --> 20:19.860\n that are extremely complicated, actually.\n\n20:19.860 --> 20:21.940\n People nevertheless connect with them.\n\n20:22.820 --> 20:24.580\n What do you think that is?\n\n20:24.580 --> 20:25.820\n It's wonderful, isn't it?\n\n20:25.820 --> 20:28.500\n I mean, I wasn't really aware of it.\n\n20:28.500 --> 20:32.020\n We're conditioned to think math is hard,\n\n20:32.020 --> 20:35.300\n math is abstract, math is just for a few people,\n\n20:35.300 --> 20:36.620\n but it isn't that way.\n\n20:36.620 --> 20:41.380\n A lot of people quite like math and they liked it.\n\n20:41.380 --> 20:44.100\n I get messages from people saying,\n\n20:44.100 --> 20:46.780\n now I'm retired, I'm gonna learn some more math.\n\n20:46.780 --> 20:47.980\n I get a lot of those.\n\n20:47.980 --> 20:49.940\n It's really encouraging.\n\n20:49.940 --> 20:53.460\n And I think what people like is that there's some order,\n\n20:53.460 --> 20:58.460\n a lot of order and things are not obvious, but they're true.\n\n21:00.380 --> 21:05.380\n So it's really cheering to think that so many people\n\n21:06.180 --> 21:08.100\n really wanna learn more about math.\n\n21:08.100 --> 21:08.940\n Yeah.\n\n21:08.940 --> 21:11.820\n And in terms of truth, again,\n\n21:11.820 --> 21:15.500\n sorry to slide into philosophy at times,\n\n21:15.500 --> 21:20.500\n but math does reveal pretty strongly what things are true.\n\n21:20.500 --> 21:23.500\n I mean, that's the whole point of proving things.\n\n21:23.500 --> 21:24.340\n It is, yeah.\n\n21:24.340 --> 21:29.340\n And yet, sort of our real world is messy and complicated.\n\n21:29.420 --> 21:30.260\n It is.\n\n21:30.260 --> 21:33.220\n What do you think about the nature of truth\n\n21:33.220 --> 21:34.540\n that math reveals?\n\n21:34.540 --> 21:35.500\n Oh, wow.\n\n21:35.500 --> 21:37.980\n Because it is a source of comfort like you've mentioned.\n\n21:37.980 --> 21:39.540\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n21:39.540 --> 21:43.020\n Well, I have to say, I'm not much of a philosopher.\n\n21:43.020 --> 21:44.740\n I just like numbers.\n\n21:44.740 --> 21:49.740\n As a kid, this was before you had to go in,\n\n21:52.100 --> 21:54.020\n when you had a filly in your teeth,\n\n21:54.020 --> 21:56.060\n you had to kind of just take it.\n\n21:56.060 --> 21:59.260\n So what I did was think about math,\n\n21:59.260 --> 22:03.100\n like take powers of two, two, four, eight, 16,\n\n22:03.100 --> 22:05.900\n up until the time the tooth stopped hurting\n\n22:05.900 --> 22:07.700\n and the dentist said you're through.\n\n22:08.700 --> 22:09.900\n Or counting.\n\n22:09.900 --> 22:10.740\n Yeah.\n\n22:10.740 --> 22:14.700\n So that was a source of just, source of peace almost.\n\n22:14.700 --> 22:15.540\n Yeah.\n\n22:15.540 --> 22:19.660\n What is it about math do you think that brings that?\n\n22:19.660 --> 22:20.500\n Yeah.\n\n22:20.500 --> 22:21.340\n What is that?\n\n22:21.340 --> 22:22.380\n Well, you know where you are.\n\n22:22.380 --> 22:25.820\n Yeah, it's symmetry, it's certainty.\n\n22:25.820 --> 22:29.820\n The fact that, you know, if you multiply two by itself\n\n22:29.820 --> 22:33.220\n 10 times, you get 1,024 period.\n\n22:33.220 --> 22:34.900\n Everybody's gonna get that.\n\n22:34.900 --> 22:39.020\n Do you see math as a powerful tool or as an art form?\n\n22:39.020 --> 22:40.300\n So it's both.\n\n22:40.300 --> 22:42.420\n That's really one of the neat things.\n\n22:42.420 --> 22:46.380\n You can be an artist and like math,\n\n22:46.380 --> 22:50.940\n you can be an engineer and use math.\n\n22:50.940 --> 22:51.940\n Which are you?\n\n22:51.940 --> 22:53.500\n Which am I?\n\n22:53.500 --> 22:54.820\n What did you connect with most?\n\n22:54.820 --> 22:57.300\n Yeah, I'm somewhere between.\n\n22:57.300 --> 23:01.540\n I'm certainly not a artist type, philosopher type person.\n\n23:01.540 --> 23:04.060\n Might sound that way this morning, but I'm not.\n\n23:04.060 --> 23:09.060\n Yeah, I really enjoy teaching engineers\n\n23:09.060 --> 23:13.260\n because they go for an answer.\n\n23:13.260 --> 23:18.260\n And yeah, so probably within the MIT math department,\n\n23:20.380 --> 23:23.620\n most people enjoy teaching people,\n\n23:23.620 --> 23:26.940\n teaching students who get the abstract idea.\n\n23:26.940 --> 23:31.940\n I'm okay with, I'm good with engineers\n\n23:32.220 --> 23:34.780\n who are looking for a way to find answers.\n\n23:34.780 --> 23:35.620\n Yeah.\n\n23:35.620 --> 23:37.700\n Actually, that's an interesting question.\n\n23:37.700 --> 23:41.340\n Do you think for teaching and in general,\n\n23:41.340 --> 23:42.740\n thinking about new concepts,\n\n23:42.740 --> 23:45.500\n do you think it's better to plug in the numbers\n\n23:46.820 --> 23:49.060\n or to think more abstractly?\n\n23:49.060 --> 23:53.620\n So looking at theorems and proving the theorems\n\n23:53.620 --> 23:58.220\n or actually building up a basic intuition of the theorem\n\n23:58.220 --> 23:59.900\n or the method, the approach,\n\n23:59.900 --> 24:02.940\n and then just plugging in numbers and seeing it work.\n\n24:02.940 --> 24:07.940\n Yeah, well, certainly many of us like to see examples.\n\n24:09.220 --> 24:11.060\n First, we understand,\n\n24:11.060 --> 24:13.980\n it might be a pretty abstract sounding example,\n\n24:13.980 --> 24:16.820\n like a three dimensional rotation.\n\n24:16.820 --> 24:21.660\n How are you gonna understand a rotation in 3D?\n\n24:22.780 --> 24:24.020\n Or in 10D?\n\n24:28.100 --> 24:30.860\n And then some of us like to keep going with it\n\n24:30.860 --> 24:32.740\n to the point where you got numbers,\n\n24:32.740 --> 24:37.100\n where you got 10 angles, 10 axes, 10 angles.\n\n24:38.100 --> 24:43.100\n But the best, the great mathematicians probably,\n\n24:43.620 --> 24:44.740\n I don't know if they do that,\n\n24:44.740 --> 24:49.740\n because for them, an example would be a highly abstract thing\n\n24:53.980 --> 24:54.820\n to the rest of it.\n\n24:54.820 --> 24:57.540\n Right, but nevertheless, working in the space of examples.\n\n24:57.540 --> 24:58.380\n Yeah, examples.\n\n24:58.380 --> 24:59.220\n It seems to.\n\n24:59.220 --> 25:01.820\n Examples of structure.\n\n25:01.820 --> 25:03.620\n Our brains seem to connect with that.\n\n25:03.620 --> 25:04.620\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n25:04.620 --> 25:07.180\n So I'm not sure if you're familiar with him,\n\n25:07.180 --> 25:10.260\n but Andrew Yang is a presidential candidate\n\n25:11.820 --> 25:16.820\n currently running with math in all capital letters\n\n25:17.060 --> 25:18.820\n and his hats as a slogan.\n\n25:18.820 --> 25:19.660\n I see.\n\n25:19.660 --> 25:21.700\n Stands for Make America Think Hard.\n\n25:21.700 --> 25:23.860\n Okay, I'll vote for him.\n\n25:25.180 --> 25:28.660\n So, and his name rhymes with yours, Yang, Strang.\n\n25:28.660 --> 25:31.260\n But he also loves math and he comes from that world\n\n25:31.260 --> 25:35.500\n of, but he also, looking at it,\n\n25:35.500 --> 25:38.580\n makes me realize that math, science, and engineering\n\n25:38.580 --> 25:43.300\n are not really part of our politics, political discourse,\n\n25:43.300 --> 25:46.140\n about political government in general.\n\n25:46.140 --> 25:48.620\n Why do you think that is?\n\n25:48.620 --> 25:49.460\n Well.\n\n25:49.460 --> 25:51.180\n What are your thoughts on that in general?\n\n25:51.180 --> 25:52.740\n Well, certainly somewhere in the system,\n\n25:52.740 --> 25:56.860\n we need people who are comfortable with numbers,\n\n25:56.860 --> 25:58.340\n comfortable with quantities.\n\n25:58.340 --> 26:02.460\n You know, if you say this leads to that,\n\n26:02.460 --> 26:05.940\n they see it and it's undeniable.\n\n26:05.940 --> 26:10.180\n But isn't that strange to you that we have almost no,\n\n26:10.180 --> 26:14.420\n I mean, I'm pretty sure we have no elected officials\n\n26:14.420 --> 26:18.380\n in Congress or obviously the president\n\n26:18.380 --> 26:22.900\n that either has an engineering degree or a math degree.\n\n26:22.900 --> 26:25.820\n Yeah, well, that's too bad.\n\n26:25.820 --> 26:30.660\n A few could, a few who could make the connection.\n\n26:30.660 --> 26:35.420\n Yeah, it would have to be people who understand\n\n26:35.420 --> 26:38.580\n engineering or science and at the same time\n\n26:38.580 --> 26:43.580\n can make speeches and lead, yeah.\n\n26:44.420 --> 26:45.540\n Yeah, inspire people.\n\n26:45.540 --> 26:46.580\n Yeah, inspire, yeah.\n\n26:46.580 --> 26:49.260\n You were, speaking of inspiration,\n\n26:49.260 --> 26:50.580\n the president of the Society\n\n26:50.580 --> 26:52.860\n for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.\n\n26:52.860 --> 26:53.700\n Oh, yes.\n\n26:53.700 --> 26:57.940\n It's a major organization in math, applied math.\n\n26:57.940 --> 27:01.180\n What do you see as a role of that society,\n\n27:01.180 --> 27:02.860\n you know, in our public discourse?\n\n27:02.860 --> 27:03.700\n Right.\n\n27:03.700 --> 27:04.540\n In public.\n\n27:04.540 --> 27:08.380\n Yeah, so, well, it was fun to be president at the time.\n\n27:08.380 --> 27:09.420\n A couple years, a few years.\n\n27:09.420 --> 27:12.140\n Two years, around 2000.\n\n27:13.660 --> 27:16.820\n I just hope that's president of a pretty small society.\n\n27:16.820 --> 27:19.620\n But nevertheless, it was a time when math\n\n27:19.620 --> 27:24.380\n was getting some more attention in Washington.\n\n27:24.380 --> 27:29.220\n But yeah, I got to give a little 10 minutes\n\n27:29.220 --> 27:33.900\n to a committee of the House of Representatives\n\n27:33.900 --> 27:35.300\n talking about who I met.\n\n27:35.300 --> 27:36.980\n And then, actually, it was fun\n\n27:36.980 --> 27:40.780\n because one of the members of the House\n\n27:42.460 --> 27:44.860\n had been a student, had been in my class.\n\n27:44.860 --> 27:46.060\n What do you think of that?\n\n27:46.060 --> 27:49.980\n Yeah, as you say, pretty rare, most members of the House\n\n27:49.980 --> 27:52.860\n have had a different training, different background.\n\n27:52.860 --> 27:56.340\n But there was one from New Hampshire\n\n27:56.340 --> 28:01.340\n who was my friend, really, by being in the class.\n\n28:02.460 --> 28:05.780\n Yeah, so those years were good.\n\n28:05.780 --> 28:10.780\n Then, of course, other things take over in importance\n\n28:10.780 --> 28:15.780\n in Washington, and math just, at this point,\n\n28:16.980 --> 28:18.260\n is not so visible.\n\n28:18.260 --> 28:20.220\n But for a little moment, it was.\n\n28:20.220 --> 28:23.780\n There's some excitement, some concern\n\n28:23.780 --> 28:26.300\n about artificial intelligence in Washington now.\n\n28:26.300 --> 28:27.460\n Yes, sure. About the future.\n\n28:27.460 --> 28:28.820\n Yeah. And I think at the core\n\n28:28.820 --> 28:30.020\n of that is math.\n\n28:30.020 --> 28:32.020\n Well, it is, yeah.\n\n28:32.020 --> 28:32.860\n Maybe it's hidden.\n\n28:32.860 --> 28:34.380\n Maybe it's wearing a different hat.\n\n28:34.380 --> 28:39.220\n Well, artificial intelligence, and particularly,\n\n28:39.220 --> 28:41.980\n can I use the words deep learning?\n\n28:41.980 --> 28:44.260\n Deep learning is a particular approach\n\n28:44.260 --> 28:47.580\n to understanding data.\n\n28:47.580 --> 28:50.180\n Again, you've got a big, whole lot of data\n\n28:51.060 --> 28:56.060\n where data is just swamping the computers of the world.\n\n28:56.140 --> 29:00.660\n And to understand it, out of all those numbers,\n\n29:00.660 --> 29:05.180\n to find what's important in climate, in everything.\n\n29:05.180 --> 29:08.500\n And artificial intelligence is two words\n\n29:08.500 --> 29:11.700\n for one approach to data.\n\n29:11.700 --> 29:15.540\n Deep learning is a specific approach there,\n\n29:15.540 --> 29:17.420\n which uses a lot of linear algebra.\n\n29:17.420 --> 29:19.300\n So I got into it.\n\n29:19.300 --> 29:21.580\n I thought, okay, I've gotta learn about this.\n\n29:21.580 --> 29:24.140\n So maybe from your perspective,\n\n29:24.140 --> 29:27.900\n let me ask the most basic question.\n\n29:27.900 --> 29:30.340\n How do you think of a neural network?\n\n29:30.340 --> 29:31.700\n What is a neural network?\n\n29:31.700 --> 29:32.660\n Yeah, okay.\n\n29:32.660 --> 29:37.220\n So can I start with the idea about deep learning?\n\n29:37.220 --> 29:38.860\n What does that mean?\n\n29:38.860 --> 29:39.940\n What is deep learning?\n\n29:39.940 --> 29:41.980\n What is deep learning, yeah.\n\n29:41.980 --> 29:46.300\n So we're trying to learn, from all this data,\n\n29:46.300 --> 29:47.900\n we're trying to learn what's important.\n\n29:47.900 --> 29:50.260\n What's it telling us?\n\n29:50.260 --> 29:55.260\n So you've got data, you've got some inputs\n\n29:55.300 --> 29:57.620\n for which you know the right outputs.\n\n29:57.620 --> 30:02.100\n The question is, can you see the pattern there?\n\n30:02.100 --> 30:04.660\n Can you figure out a way for a new input,\n\n30:04.660 --> 30:09.660\n which we haven't seen, to understand\n\n30:09.740 --> 30:12.220\n what the output will be from that new input?\n\n30:12.220 --> 30:15.940\n So we've got a million inputs with their outputs.\n\n30:15.940 --> 30:19.260\n So we're trying to create some pattern,\n\n30:19.260 --> 30:22.180\n some rule that'll take those inputs,\n\n30:22.180 --> 30:25.580\n those million training inputs, which we know about,\n\n30:25.580 --> 30:28.180\n to the correct million outputs.\n\n30:28.180 --> 30:32.780\n And this idea of a neural net\n\n30:32.780 --> 30:37.780\n is part of the structure of our new way to create a rule.\n\n30:40.700 --> 30:43.900\n We're looking for a rule that will take\n\n30:43.900 --> 30:48.460\n these training inputs to the known outputs.\n\n30:48.460 --> 30:51.660\n And then we're gonna use that rule on new inputs\n\n30:51.660 --> 30:56.100\n that we don't know the output and see what comes.\n\n30:56.100 --> 30:59.140\n Linear algebra is a big part of finding that rule.\n\n30:59.140 --> 31:01.860\n That's right, linear algebra is a big part.\n\n31:01.860 --> 31:03.500\n Not all the part.\n\n31:03.500 --> 31:08.300\n People were leaning on matrices, that's good, still do.\n\n31:08.300 --> 31:10.300\n Linear is something special.\n\n31:10.300 --> 31:13.980\n It's all about straight lines and flat planes.\n\n31:13.980 --> 31:18.860\n And data isn't quite like that.\n\n31:18.860 --> 31:21.220\n It's more complicated.\n\n31:21.220 --> 31:23.700\n So you gotta introduce some complication.\n\n31:23.700 --> 31:25.460\n So you have to have some function\n\n31:25.460 --> 31:27.460\n that's not a straight line.\n\n31:27.460 --> 31:31.620\n And it turned out, nonlinear, nonlinear, not linear.\n\n31:31.620 --> 31:35.860\n And it turned out that it was enough to use the function\n\n31:35.860 --> 31:38.340\n that's one straight line and then a different one.\n\n31:38.340 --> 31:40.900\n Halfway, so piecewise linear.\n\n31:40.900 --> 31:44.420\n One piece has one slope,\n\n31:44.420 --> 31:47.340\n one piece, the other piece has the second slope.\n\n31:47.340 --> 31:52.340\n And so that, getting that nonlinear,\n\n31:52.380 --> 31:56.700\n simple nonlinearity in blew the problem open.\n\n31:56.700 --> 31:58.980\n That little piece makes it sufficiently complicated\n\n31:58.980 --> 32:00.460\n to make things interesting.\n\n32:00.460 --> 32:02.020\n Because you're gonna use that piece\n\n32:02.020 --> 32:03.820\n over and over a million times.\n\n32:03.820 --> 32:08.820\n So it has a fold in the graph, the graph, two pieces.\n\n32:10.740 --> 32:13.700\n But when you fold something a million times,\n\n32:13.700 --> 32:17.860\n you've got a pretty complicated function\n\n32:17.860 --> 32:19.260\n that's pretty realistic.\n\n32:19.260 --> 32:21.140\n So that's the thing about neural networks\n\n32:21.140 --> 32:23.900\n is they have a lot of these.\n\n32:23.900 --> 32:25.220\n A lot of these, that's right.\n\n32:25.220 --> 32:29.660\n So why do you think neural networks,\n\n32:29.660 --> 32:34.660\n by using sort of formulating an objective function,\n\n32:34.940 --> 32:39.380\n very not a plain function of the folds,\n\n32:39.380 --> 32:42.340\n lots of folds of the inputs, the outputs,\n\n32:42.340 --> 32:47.300\n why do you think they work to be able to find a rule\n\n32:47.300 --> 32:48.780\n that we don't know is optimal,\n\n32:48.780 --> 32:53.300\n but it just seems to be pretty good in a lot of cases?\n\n32:53.300 --> 32:54.580\n What's your intuition?\n\n32:54.580 --> 32:58.180\n Is it surprising to you as it is to many people?\n\n32:58.180 --> 33:01.140\n Do you have an intuition of why this works at all?\n\n33:01.140 --> 33:04.300\n Well, I'm beginning to have a better intuition.\n\n33:04.300 --> 33:08.500\n This idea of things that are piecewise linear,\n\n33:08.500 --> 33:12.140\n flat pieces but with folds between them.\n\n33:12.140 --> 33:14.980\n Like think of a roof of a complicated,\n\n33:14.980 --> 33:17.780\n infinitely complicated house or something.\n\n33:17.780 --> 33:22.780\n That curve, it almost curved, but every piece is flat.\n\n33:24.700 --> 33:26.820\n That's been used by engineers,\n\n33:26.820 --> 33:29.660\n that idea has been used by engineers,\n\n33:29.660 --> 33:32.140\n is used by engineers, big time.\n\n33:32.140 --> 33:34.220\n Something called the finite element method.\n\n33:34.220 --> 33:36.980\n If you want to design a bridge,\n\n33:36.980 --> 33:40.860\n design a building, design an airplane,\n\n33:40.860 --> 33:45.860\n you're using this idea of piecewise flat\n\n33:47.300 --> 33:52.260\n as a good, simple, computable approximation.\n\n33:52.260 --> 33:57.260\n But you have a sense that there's a lot of expressive power\n\n33:57.260 --> 33:58.580\n in this kind of piecewise linear.\n\n33:58.580 --> 34:01.820\n Yeah, you used the right word.\n\n34:01.820 --> 34:04.460\n If you measure the expressivity,\n\n34:04.460 --> 34:09.460\n how complicated a thing can this piecewise flat guys express?\n\n34:12.300 --> 34:15.500\n The answer is very complicated, yeah.\n\n34:15.500 --> 34:20.380\n What do you think are the limits of such piecewise linear\n\n34:20.380 --> 34:22.660\n or just of neural networks?\n\n34:22.660 --> 34:24.100\n The expressivity of neural networks.\n\n34:24.100 --> 34:26.660\n Well, you would have said a while ago\n\n34:26.660 --> 34:28.700\n that they're just computational limits.\n\n34:28.700 --> 34:33.700\n It's a problem beyond a certain size.\n\n34:33.740 --> 34:36.060\n A supercomputer isn't gonna do it.\n\n34:36.060 --> 34:39.420\n But those keep getting more powerful.\n\n34:39.420 --> 34:42.660\n So that limit has been moved\n\n34:44.260 --> 34:47.420\n to allow more and more complicated surfaces.\n\n34:47.420 --> 34:52.420\n So in terms of just mapping from inputs to outputs,\n\n34:52.940 --> 34:57.940\n looking at data, what do you think of,\n\n34:58.460 --> 35:00.500\n in the context of neural networks in general,\n\n35:00.500 --> 35:04.180\n data is just tensor, vectors, matrices, tensors.\n\n35:04.180 --> 35:05.820\n Right.\n\n35:05.820 --> 35:09.380\n How do you think about learning from data?\n\n35:09.380 --> 35:12.780\n How much of our world can be expressed in this way?\n\n35:12.780 --> 35:16.540\n How useful is this process?\n\n35:16.540 --> 35:17.980\n I guess that's another way to ask you,\n\n35:17.980 --> 35:19.340\n what are the limits of this approach?\n\n35:19.340 --> 35:21.380\n Well, that's a good question, yeah.\n\n35:21.380 --> 35:24.220\n So I guess the whole idea of deep learning\n\n35:24.220 --> 35:26.220\n is that there's something there to learn.\n\n35:26.220 --> 35:28.500\n If the data is totally random,\n\n35:28.500 --> 35:31.380\n just produced by random number generators,\n\n35:31.380 --> 35:36.220\n then we're not gonna find a useful rule\n\n35:36.220 --> 35:37.380\n because there isn't one.\n\n35:38.620 --> 35:43.620\n So the extreme of having a rule is like knowing Newton's law.\n\n35:43.620 --> 35:46.220\n If you hit a ball, it moves.\n\n35:46.220 --> 35:48.940\n So that's where you had laws of physics.\n\n35:48.940 --> 35:53.940\n Newton and Einstein and other great, great people\n\n35:54.140 --> 35:59.140\n have found those laws and laws of the distribution\n\n36:02.940 --> 36:05.900\n of oil in an underground thing.\n\n36:05.900 --> 36:10.900\n I mean, so engineers, petroleum engineers understand\n\n36:10.900 --> 36:15.900\n how oil will sit in an underground basin.\n\n36:18.180 --> 36:20.060\n So there were rules.\n\n36:20.060 --> 36:25.060\n Now, the new idea of artificial intelligence is\n\n36:25.620 --> 36:29.940\n learn the rules instead of figuring out the rules\n\n36:29.940 --> 36:32.740\n with help from Newton or Einstein.\n\n36:32.740 --> 36:35.660\n The computer is looking for the rules.\n\n36:35.660 --> 36:36.900\n So that's another step.\n\n36:36.900 --> 36:39.860\n But if there are no rules at all\n\n36:39.860 --> 36:41.220\n that the computer could find,\n\n36:41.220 --> 36:45.300\n if it's totally random data, well, you've got nothing.\n\n36:45.300 --> 36:48.300\n You've got no science to discover.\n\n36:48.300 --> 36:51.380\n It's an automated search for the underlying rules.\n\n36:51.380 --> 36:53.380\n Yeah, search for the rules.\n\n36:53.380 --> 36:54.780\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n36:54.780 --> 36:57.820\n And there will be a lot of random parts.\n\n36:57.820 --> 36:59.860\n A lot of, I mean, I'm not knocking random\n\n36:59.860 --> 37:02.740\n because that's there.\n\n37:05.580 --> 37:07.340\n There's a lot of randomness built in,\n\n37:07.340 --> 37:09.380\n but there's gotta be some basic.\n\n37:09.380 --> 37:10.900\n It's almost always signal, right?\n\n37:10.900 --> 37:11.740\n In most things.\n\n37:11.740 --> 37:12.820\n There's gotta be some signal, yeah.\n\n37:12.820 --> 37:17.420\n If it's all noise, then you're not gonna get anywhere.\n\n37:17.420 --> 37:19.900\n Well, this world around us does seem to be,\n\n37:19.900 --> 37:22.420\n does seem to always have a signal of some kind.\n\n37:22.420 --> 37:23.340\n Yeah, yeah, that's right.\n\n37:23.340 --> 37:24.220\n To be discovered.\n\n37:24.220 --> 37:25.900\n Right, that's it.\n\n37:25.900 --> 37:29.460\n So what excites you more?\n\n37:30.580 --> 37:32.860\n We just talked about a little bit of application.\n\n37:32.860 --> 37:34.540\n What excites you more, theory\n\n37:35.580 --> 37:38.380\n or the application of mathematics?\n\n37:38.380 --> 37:43.260\n Well, for myself, I'm probably a theory person.\n\n37:43.260 --> 37:48.260\n I'm not, I'm speaking here pretty freely about applications,\n\n37:49.700 --> 37:53.220\n but I'm not the person who really,\n\n37:53.220 --> 37:57.060\n I'm not a physicist or a chemist or a neuroscientist.\n\n37:58.100 --> 38:03.100\n So for myself, I like the structure\n\n38:03.220 --> 38:06.460\n and the flat subspaces\n\n38:06.460 --> 38:11.460\n and the relation of matrices, columns to rows.\n\n38:12.260 --> 38:17.260\n That's my part in the spectrum.\n\n38:17.860 --> 38:22.420\n So really, science is a big spectrum of people\n\n38:22.420 --> 38:25.740\n from asking practical questions\n\n38:25.740 --> 38:28.740\n and answering them using some math,\n\n38:28.740 --> 38:33.740\n then some math guys like myself who are in the middle of it\n\n38:33.740 --> 38:38.740\n and then the geniuses of math and physics and chemistry\n\n38:40.620 --> 38:43.300\n who are finding fundamental rules\n\n38:43.300 --> 38:48.300\n and then doing the really understanding nature.\n\n38:50.060 --> 38:51.820\n That's incredible.\n\n38:51.820 --> 38:54.980\n At its lowest, simplest level,\n\n38:54.980 --> 38:58.980\n maybe just a quick in broad strokes from your perspective,\n\n38:58.980 --> 39:03.980\n where does linear algebra sit as a subfield of mathematics?\n\n39:04.740 --> 39:09.740\n What are the various subfields that you think about\n\n39:10.300 --> 39:12.180\n in relation to linear algebra?\n\n39:12.180 --> 39:17.180\n So the big fields of math are algebra as a whole\n\n39:18.020 --> 39:21.340\n and problems like calculus and differential equations.\n\n39:21.340 --> 39:24.340\n So that's a second, quite different field.\n\n39:24.340 --> 39:28.780\n Then maybe geometry deserves to be thought of\n\n39:28.780 --> 39:31.540\n as a different field to understand the geometry\n\n39:31.540 --> 39:34.100\n of high dimensional surfaces.\n\n39:35.700 --> 39:39.700\n So I think, am I allowed to say this here?\n\n39:39.700 --> 39:44.700\n I think this is where personal view comes in.\n\n39:46.180 --> 39:51.180\n I think math, we're thinking about undergraduate math,\n\n39:51.980 --> 39:54.260\n what millions of students study.\n\n39:54.260 --> 39:59.260\n I think we overdo the calculus at the cost of the algebra,\n\n40:00.780 --> 40:02.660\n at the cost of linear.\n\n40:02.660 --> 40:05.300\n So you have this talk titled Calculus Versus Linear Algebra.\n\n40:05.300 --> 40:07.380\n That's right, that's right.\n\n40:07.380 --> 40:09.420\n And you say that linear algebra wins.\n\n40:09.420 --> 40:13.780\n So can you dig into that a little bit?\n\n40:13.780 --> 40:17.020\n Why does linear algebra win?\n\n40:17.020 --> 40:21.100\n Right, well, okay, the viewer is gonna think\n\n40:21.100 --> 40:22.700\n this guy is biased.\n\n40:22.700 --> 40:27.060\n Not true, I'm just telling the truth as it is.\n\n40:27.060 --> 40:31.940\n Yeah, so I feel linear algebra is just a nice part of math\n\n40:31.940 --> 40:34.420\n that people can get the idea of.\n\n40:34.420 --> 40:37.780\n They can understand something that's a little bit abstract\n\n40:37.780 --> 40:40.660\n because once you get to 10 or 100 dimensions\n\n40:42.140 --> 40:44.380\n and very, very, very useful,\n\n40:44.380 --> 40:47.860\n that's what's happened in my lifetime\n\n40:47.860 --> 40:52.540\n is the importance of data,\n\n40:52.540 --> 40:54.660\n which does come in matrix form.\n\n40:54.660 --> 40:56.660\n So it's really set up for algebra.\n\n40:56.660 --> 40:59.260\n It's not set up for differential equation.\n\n40:59.260 --> 41:03.300\n And let me fairly add probability,\n\n41:03.300 --> 41:06.860\n the ideas of probability and statistics\n\n41:06.860 --> 41:11.260\n have become very, very important, have also jumped forward.\n\n41:11.260 --> 41:14.060\n So, and that's different from linear algebra,\n\n41:14.060 --> 41:15.220\n quite different.\n\n41:15.220 --> 41:20.220\n So now we really have three major areas to me,\n\n41:20.220 --> 41:25.220\n calculus, linear algebra, matrices,\n\n41:26.180 --> 41:28.980\n and probability statistics.\n\n41:28.980 --> 41:33.980\n And they all deserve an important place.\n\n41:33.980 --> 41:38.980\n And calculus has traditionally had a lion's share\n\n41:40.020 --> 41:40.860\n of the time.\n\n41:40.860 --> 41:41.900\n A disproportionate share.\n\n41:41.900 --> 41:44.700\n It is, thank you, disproportionate, that's a good word.\n\n41:45.700 --> 41:50.020\n Of the love and attention from the excited young minds.\n\n41:50.020 --> 41:50.860\n Yeah.\n\n41:52.900 --> 41:55.500\n I know it's hard to pick favorites,\n\n41:55.500 --> 41:57.700\n but what is your favorite matrix?\n\n41:57.700 --> 41:59.380\n What's my favorite matrix?\n\n41:59.380 --> 42:03.220\n Okay, so my favorite matrix is square, I admit it.\n\n42:03.220 --> 42:05.460\n It's a square bunch of numbers\n\n42:05.460 --> 42:10.180\n and it has twos running down the main diagonal.\n\n42:10.180 --> 42:13.020\n And on the next diagonal,\n\n42:13.020 --> 42:15.380\n so think of top left to bottom right,\n\n42:15.380 --> 42:18.900\n twos down the middle of the matrix\n\n42:18.900 --> 42:22.140\n and minus ones just above those twos\n\n42:22.140 --> 42:25.020\n and minus ones just below those twos\n\n42:25.020 --> 42:26.620\n and otherwise all zeros.\n\n42:26.620 --> 42:31.620\n So mostly zeros, just three nonzero diagonals coming down.\n\n42:32.900 --> 42:34.380\n What is interesting about it?\n\n42:34.380 --> 42:37.180\n Well, all the different ways it comes up.\n\n42:37.180 --> 42:39.260\n You see it in engineering,\n\n42:39.260 --> 42:44.100\n you see it as analogous in calculus to second derivative.\n\n42:44.100 --> 42:47.180\n So calculus learns about taking the derivative,\n\n42:47.180 --> 42:50.620\n the figuring out how much, how fast something's changing.\n\n42:51.500 --> 42:55.740\n But second derivative, now that's also important.\n\n42:55.740 --> 42:58.740\n That's how fast the change is changing,\n\n42:58.740 --> 43:03.740\n how fast the graph is bending, how fast it's curving.\n\n43:06.460 --> 43:10.140\n And Einstein showed that that's fundamental\n\n43:10.140 --> 43:11.540\n to understand space.\n\n43:11.540 --> 43:16.540\n So second derivatives should have a bigger place in calculus.\n\n43:17.380 --> 43:21.020\n Second, my matrices,\n\n43:21.020 --> 43:24.980\n which are like the linear algebra version\n\n43:24.980 --> 43:29.980\n of second derivatives are neat in linear algebra.\n\n43:30.020 --> 43:32.780\n Yeah, just everything comes out right with those guys.\n\n43:34.020 --> 43:35.220\n Beautiful.\n\n43:35.220 --> 43:38.380\n What did you learn about the process of learning\n\n43:38.380 --> 43:42.820\n by having taught so many students math over the years?\n\n43:42.820 --> 43:44.820\n Ooh, that is hard.\n\n43:45.700 --> 43:50.700\n I'll have to admit here that I'm not really a good teacher\n\n43:51.260 --> 43:55.540\n because I don't get into the exam part.\n\n43:55.540 --> 43:59.020\n The exam is the part of my life that I don't like\n\n43:59.020 --> 44:04.020\n and grading them and giving the students A or B or whatever.\n\n44:04.380 --> 44:08.260\n I do it because I'm supposed to do it,\n\n44:08.260 --> 44:11.900\n but I tell the class at the beginning,\n\n44:11.900 --> 44:13.180\n I don't know if they believe me.\n\n44:13.180 --> 44:14.580\n Probably they don't.\n\n44:14.580 --> 44:18.020\n I tell the class, I'm here to teach you.\n\n44:18.020 --> 44:21.620\n I'm here to teach you math and not to grade you.\n\n44:22.700 --> 44:26.300\n But they're thinking, okay, this guy is gonna,\n\n44:26.300 --> 44:28.820\n when is he gonna give me an A minus?\n\n44:28.820 --> 44:30.580\n Is he gonna give me a B plus?\n\n44:30.580 --> 44:31.420\n What?\n\n44:31.420 --> 44:34.060\n What have you learned about the process of learning?\n\n44:34.060 --> 44:34.940\n Of learning.\n\n44:34.940 --> 44:39.940\n Yeah, well, maybe to give you a legitimate answer\n\n44:40.220 --> 44:43.900\n about learning, I should have paid more attention\n\n44:43.900 --> 44:47.660\n to the assessment, the evaluation part at the end.\n\n44:47.660 --> 44:49.980\n But I like the teaching part at the start.\n\n44:49.980 --> 44:52.060\n That's the sexy part.\n\n44:52.060 --> 44:56.060\n To tell somebody for the first time about a matrix, wow.\n\n44:56.060 --> 44:58.700\n Is there, are there moments,\n\n44:58.700 --> 45:01.900\n so you are teaching a concept,\n\n45:01.900 --> 45:05.500\n are there moments of learning that you just see\n\n45:05.500 --> 45:06.460\n in the student's eyes?\n\n45:06.460 --> 45:08.220\n You don't need to look at the grades.\n\n45:08.220 --> 45:11.540\n But you see in their eyes that you hook them,\n\n45:11.540 --> 45:16.260\n that you connect with them in a way where,\n\n45:16.260 --> 45:18.620\n you know what, they fall in love\n\n45:18.620 --> 45:21.180\n with this beautiful world of math.\n\n45:21.180 --> 45:24.460\n They see that it's got some beauty there.\n\n45:24.460 --> 45:28.060\n Or conversely, that they give up at that point\n\n45:28.060 --> 45:29.140\n is the opposite.\n\n45:29.140 --> 45:32.420\n The dark could say that math, I'm just not good at math.\n\n45:32.420 --> 45:33.260\n I don't wanna walk away.\n\n45:33.260 --> 45:34.300\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n45:34.300 --> 45:37.700\n Maybe because of the approach in the past,\n\n45:37.700 --> 45:40.500\n they were discouraged, but don't be discouraged.\n\n45:40.500 --> 45:43.100\n It's too good to miss.\n\n45:44.420 --> 45:48.420\n Yeah, well, if I'm teaching a big class,\n\n45:48.420 --> 45:51.900\n do I know when, I think maybe I do.\n\n45:51.900 --> 45:55.460\n Sort of, I mentioned at the very start,\n\n45:55.460 --> 45:59.340\n the four fundamental subspaces\n\n45:59.340 --> 46:03.100\n and the structure of the fundamental theorem\n\n46:03.100 --> 46:04.740\n of linear algebra.\n\n46:04.740 --> 46:06.780\n The fundamental theorem of linear algebra.\n\n46:06.780 --> 46:11.740\n That is the relation of those four subspaces,\n\n46:11.740 --> 46:13.420\n those four spaces.\n\n46:13.420 --> 46:17.740\n Yeah, so I think that, I feel that the class gets it.\n\n46:17.740 --> 46:18.580\n At length.\n\n46:18.580 --> 46:19.940\n Yeah.\n\n46:19.940 --> 46:22.420\n What advice do you have to a student\n\n46:22.420 --> 46:25.140\n just starting their journey in mathematics today?\n\n46:25.140 --> 46:27.060\n How do they get started?\n\n46:27.060 --> 46:30.100\n Oh, yeah, that's hard.\n\n46:30.100 --> 46:34.780\n Well, I hope you have a teacher, professor,\n\n46:34.780 --> 46:39.780\n who is still enjoying what he's doing,\n\n46:39.860 --> 46:41.380\n what he's teaching.\n\n46:41.380 --> 46:44.020\n They're still looking for new ways to teach\n\n46:44.020 --> 46:46.700\n and to understand math.\n\n46:47.940 --> 46:49.660\n Cause that's the pleasure,\n\n46:51.140 --> 46:54.980\n the moment when you see, oh yeah, that works.\n\n46:54.980 --> 46:58.500\n So it's less about the material you study,\n\n46:58.500 --> 47:02.460\n it's more about the source of the teacher\n\n47:02.460 --> 47:03.900\n being full of passion.\n\n47:03.900 --> 47:05.740\n Yeah, more about the fun.\n\n47:05.740 --> 47:10.500\n Yeah, the moment of getting it.\n\n47:10.500 --> 47:14.140\n But in terms of topics, linear algebra?\n\n47:14.140 --> 47:16.940\n Well, that's my topic,\n\n47:16.940 --> 47:21.220\n but oh, there's beautiful things in geometry to understand.\n\n47:21.220 --> 47:24.140\n What's wonderful is that in the end,\n\n47:24.140 --> 47:28.620\n there's a pattern, there are rules\n\n47:28.620 --> 47:33.620\n that are followed in biology as there are in every field.\n\n47:37.260 --> 47:41.420\n You describe the life of a mathematician\n\n47:41.420 --> 47:44.260\n as 100% wonderful.\n\n47:44.260 --> 47:45.620\n No.\n\n47:45.620 --> 47:47.140\n Except for the grade stuff.\n\n47:47.140 --> 47:47.980\n Yeah.\n\n47:47.980 --> 47:48.820\n And the grades.\n\n47:48.820 --> 47:49.660\n Except for grades.\n\n47:49.660 --> 47:52.140\n Yeah, when you look back at your life,\n\n47:52.140 --> 47:54.940\n what memories bring you the most joy and pride?\n\n47:55.980 --> 47:58.220\n Well, that's a good question.\n\n47:59.500 --> 48:01.620\n I certainly feel good when I,\n\n48:01.620 --> 48:06.140\n maybe I'm giving a class in 1806,\n\n48:06.140 --> 48:09.380\n that's MIT's linear algebra course that I started.\n\n48:09.380 --> 48:11.620\n So sort of, there's a good feeling that,\n\n48:11.620 --> 48:13.740\n okay, I started this course,\n\n48:13.740 --> 48:17.340\n

48:27.740\n between ideas and students,\n\n48:27.740 --> 48:31.860\n between theory and the reader.\n\n48:32.980 --> 48:37.340\n Yeah, it's, I get a lot of very nice messages\n\n48:38.540 --> 48:43.460\n from people who've watched the videos and it's inspiring.\n\n48:43.460 --> 48:47.220\n I just, I'll maybe take this chance to say thank you.\n\n48:48.060 --> 48:50.380\n Well, there's
