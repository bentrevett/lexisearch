known for producing blockbusters\n\n00:06.820 --> 00:09.140\n like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy,\n\n00:09.140 --> 00:12.300\n The Hangover franchise, Godzilla, Inception,\n\n00:12.300 --> 00:15.700\n Jurassic World, 300, and many more.\n\n00:15.700 --> 00:18.180\n He runs Tolko, which is an investment company\n\n00:18.180 --> 00:21.040\n that focuses on how artificial intelligence\n\n00:21.040 --> 00:23.820\n can revolutionize large industries.\n\n00:23.820 --> 00:26.500\n He is part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n00:26.500 --> 00:29.020\n He's the guitarist for the band Ghost Hounds\n\n00:29.020 --> 00:31.620\n that tours with the Rolling Stones.\n\n00:31.620 --> 00:35.340\n But most importantly, he's humble, down to earth,\n\n00:35.340 --> 00:38.360\n and someone who has quickly become a mentor and friend.\n\n00:39.300 --> 00:41.460\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:41.460 --> 00:43.580\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:43.580 --> 00:44.900\n in the description.\n\n00:44.900 --> 00:48.760\n And now, here's my conversation with Thomas Tall.\n\n00:49.780 --> 00:53.260\n In 2004, you founded Legendary Entertainment,\n\n00:53.260 --> 00:55.020\n known for producing blockbusters\n\n00:55.020 --> 00:57.860\n like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy,\n\n00:57.860 --> 00:59.900\n that includes Batman Begins, Dark Knight,\n\n00:59.900 --> 01:03.260\n and Dark Knight Rises, The Hangover franchise,\n\n01:03.260 --> 01:05.900\n Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300,\n\n01:05.900 --> 01:07.220\n and the list goes on.\n\n01:07.220 --> 01:10.380\n It's just some of the biggest movies in history.\n\n01:10.380 --> 01:12.580\n What does it take to make an epic movie like that?\n\n01:12.580 --> 01:14.140\n Or what does it take to make it happen\n\n01:14.140 --> 01:15.220\n from start to finish?\n\n01:16.660 --> 01:19.620\n Well, look, I've been enamored with movies\n\n01:19.620 --> 01:21.300\n since I was a kid as a fan,\n\n01:21.300 --> 01:25.260\n and I think what you need is to be able\n\n01:25.260 --> 01:26.620\n to tell a great story.\n\n01:26.620 --> 01:28.700\n And if you're gonna tell a great story,\n\n01:28.700 --> 01:30.380\n you need a great director.\n\n01:30.380 --> 01:32.620\n You gotta start with a fantastic script\n\n01:33.880 --> 01:38.380\n that is able to take some of these iconic characters\n\n01:38.380 --> 01:41.060\n that we did and put your own stamp on it\n\n01:41.060 --> 01:44.860\n while still respecting the mythology.\n\n01:44.860 --> 01:48.700\n And I had zero experience in movies and television\n\n01:48.700 --> 01:50.220\n before I started Legendary,\n\n01:50.220 --> 01:53.220\n so it was a very interesting trip.\n\n01:53.220 --> 01:57.300\n Total luck that we had the opportunity\n\n01:57.300 --> 02:01.020\n to make five movies at the time with Chris Nolan,\n\n02:01.020 --> 02:03.140\n who turned out to be one of the greatest filmmakers\n\n02:03.140 --> 02:04.480\n of all time.\n\n02:04.480 --> 02:07.880\n But each one is its own little startup company,\n\n02:08.900 --> 02:11.980\n and I don't think there's any formula to get there,\n\n02:11.980 --> 02:15.140\n but I know that if you don't have a great director\n\n02:15.140 --> 02:17.620\n and a great script, if you don't have that foundation,\n\n02:17.620 --> 02:18.940\n it's hard to pull off.\n\n02:18.940 --> 02:21.180\n Who's the CEO of that little startup company?\n\n02:21.180 --> 02:22.780\n Is it the director?\n\n02:22.780 --> 02:25.100\n Who would you say defines the success\n\n02:25.100 --> 02:26.440\n or the failure of a movie?\n\n02:26.440 --> 02:30.000\n Well, when you build a big movie like that,\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.380\n it's an enormous effort, 360 degrees.\n\n02:33.380 --> 02:37.820\n I mean, from digital effects, certainly the actors.\n\n02:37.820 --> 02:40.860\n I mean, if you have an amazing script and amazing director,\n\n02:40.860 --> 02:42.980\n but you don't believe anybody playing the parts,\n\n02:42.980 --> 02:43.820\n that's a problem.\n\n02:43.820 --> 02:47.940\n So the reason I think it was so difficult to pull off\n\n02:47.940 --> 02:51.200\n is I always used to say you start with a stack of papers\n\n02:51.200 --> 02:55.820\n with words on it called the script, bring that to life,\n\n02:55.820 --> 02:58.500\n and you're asking an audience to believe in everything\n\n02:58.500 --> 03:00.340\n that you're trying to put out there,\n\n03:00.340 --> 03:02.900\n and you've got a cast that,\n\n03:02.900 --> 03:05.100\n even if they're immensely talented individually,\n\n03:05.100 --> 03:06.380\n they have to mesh together,\n\n03:06.380 --> 03:08.280\n they have to have chemistry together.\n\n03:09.820 --> 03:13.780\n And the director is kind of a general on the battlefield,\n\n03:13.780 --> 03:18.380\n but if you have a strong producer who's very hands on,\n\n03:18.380 --> 03:22.340\n but it truly, to me, is each one had its own story\n\n03:22.340 --> 03:24.740\n and its own sort of how it came to be\n\n03:24.740 --> 03:27.360\n and why it worked or didn't work.\n\n03:28.260 --> 03:30.780\n See, you said you were new to the industry,\n\n03:30.780 --> 03:34.540\n but you did a lot of revolutionary things with Legendary.\n\n03:34.540 --> 03:38.660\n So at that time and now, what is the good, the bad,\n\n03:38.660 --> 03:41.340\n and the ugly of the business of filmmaking?\n\n03:41.340 --> 03:44.460\n What are some interesting holes that you were able to,\n\n03:44.460 --> 03:47.340\n or like problems that you were able to fix?\n\n03:47.340 --> 03:50.860\n What problems still exist that can still be solved?\n\n03:51.900 --> 03:55.900\n Well, look, the business has changed so radically\n\n03:55.900 --> 03:58.220\n since 2004.\n\n03:58.220 --> 04:01.740\n When I started Legendary, DVDs were still a cash cow.\n\n04:01.740 --> 04:05.580\n So that's how far things have come.\n\n04:05.580 --> 04:07.140\n But I would say a couple of things.\n\n04:07.140 --> 04:10.740\n The reason that I started it from a business perspective\n\n04:10.740 --> 04:14.220\n was at the time it was a $30 billion industry,\n\n04:14.220 --> 04:17.660\n and there was no institutional capital\n\n04:17.660 --> 04:19.640\n around the movie business.\n\n04:19.640 --> 04:20.860\n And I was fascinated by that\n\n04:20.860 --> 04:23.700\n because almost every other category that you look at\n\n04:23.700 --> 04:26.420\n of that size has institutional capital,\n\n04:26.420 --> 04:27.980\n private equity, et cetera,\n\n04:27.980 --> 04:31.020\n is kind of a cottage industry set up around it.\n\n04:31.020 --> 04:35.020\n And I was perplexed and fascinated that that didn't occur.\n\n04:35.020 --> 04:36.780\n And the way the movie business worked\n\n04:36.780 --> 04:40.020\n was unlike any business I'd ever looked at before.\n\n04:40.020 --> 04:43.840\n So after kind of convincing myself\n\n04:43.840 --> 04:45.980\n that you could actually make money\n\n04:45.980 --> 04:48.500\n if you were disciplined and had the right approach,\n\n04:49.500 --> 04:50.340\n you know, went out,\n\n04:50.340 --> 04:52.300\n raised the money from the capital markets,\n\n04:52.300 --> 04:54.740\n markets which was Herculean,\n\n04:54.740 --> 04:58.880\n still maybe the hardest thing I've ever done in my career,\n\n04:58.880 --> 05:01.980\n to walk around and say, look, I have no experience.\n\n05:01.980 --> 05:04.980\n I've never done this before, but, you know.\n\n05:04.980 --> 05:08.940\n And the second thing, being very fortunate at the time,\n\n05:08.940 --> 05:11.740\n was able to partner up with Warner Brothers.\n\n05:11.740 --> 05:15.860\n Warner's at the time was run by a man named Alan Horn,\n\n05:15.860 --> 05:18.920\n who besides being creative is also a Harvard MBA.\n\n05:18.920 --> 05:21.660\n So really understood what I wanted to do.\n\n05:22.780 --> 05:26.300\n And Alan, you know, was just an absolute gentleman,\n\n05:26.300 --> 05:29.380\n someone that I still look up to to this day.\n\n05:29.380 --> 05:31.860\n After Warner Brothers, he went and ran Disney\n\n05:31.860 --> 05:33.560\n with their run, you know,\n\n05:33.560 --> 05:35.640\n between Marvel and Star Wars and everything.\n\n05:35.640 --> 05:40.640\n And so between Alan being responsible for Harry Potter,\n\n05:40.640 --> 05:43.020\n the Dark Knight stuff, and then onto all the Disney stuff,\n\n05:43.020 --> 05:44.500\n he probably had as great a career\n\n05:44.500 --> 05:47.940\n as anyone I've ever heard of in the movie business.\n\n05:47.940 --> 05:52.140\n So my first focus was around sort of two concepts,\n\n05:52.140 --> 05:57.140\n global, worldwide, large tentpole films and franchises,\n\n05:57.420 --> 05:59.660\n and then the business aspect of being,\n\n05:59.660 --> 06:03.300\n bringing longterm institutional capital to bear.\n\n06:03.300 --> 06:05.460\n I'm gonna ask you dumb questions,\n\n06:05.460 --> 06:10.380\n which is part of the style, I guess.\n\n06:10.380 --> 06:13.820\n But just for people who don't know, including me,\n\n06:13.820 --> 06:16.500\n what is institutional, what is capital?\n\n06:16.500 --> 06:18.340\n What is institutional capital?\n\n06:18.340 --> 06:20.700\n What is equity, what is private equity?\n\n06:20.700 --> 06:21.800\n Got it, okay.\n\n06:21.800 --> 06:26.080\n Well, so if you're starting a company\n\n06:27.040 --> 06:30.900\n and you go around to a bunch of your successful friends\n\n06:30.900 --> 06:34.020\n and say, hey, you should invest in my company.\n\n06:34.020 --> 06:37.380\n Well, that's sort of, that's great and it's capital,\n\n06:37.380 --> 06:42.380\n but it's not getting money from Fidelity or TRO\n\n06:42.700 --> 06:46.580\n or a sovereign wealth fund or an endowment fund\n\n06:46.580 --> 06:51.580\n from a university that has large pools of organized capital\n\n06:52.100 --> 06:56.500\n that has a longterm point of view on your business.\n\n06:56.500 --> 06:59.260\n So if you get money from your neighbor\n\n06:59.260 --> 07:01.520\n who's a successful dentist,\n\n07:01.520 --> 07:03.580\n next year the dentist may say,\n\n07:03.580 --> 07:07.380\n hey, times are hard, I need my money back.\n\n07:07.380 --> 07:10.660\n If you're partners with Fidelity or Morgan Stanley\n\n07:10.660 --> 07:12.460\n or any of these institutions,\n\n07:12.460 --> 07:16.180\n they have the capital and the wherewithal to say,\n\n07:16.180 --> 07:19.540\n okay, I'm looking at this over the next five to 10 years.\n\n07:19.540 --> 07:21.540\n And I thought there was an opportunity\n\n07:21.540 --> 07:26.540\n to bring that type of capital to the movie business\n\n07:26.660 --> 07:27.980\n to be patient.\n\n07:27.980 --> 07:32.780\n And the benefit of that patient, so it's longterm,\n\n07:32.780 --> 07:34.980\n you have to deal with fewer parties\n\n07:34.980 --> 07:37.780\n and they would do much larger investments.\n\n07:38.740 --> 07:40.100\n So what are the benefits?\n\n07:40.100 --> 07:41.540\n What are the sort of the challenges\n\n07:41.540 --> 07:42.740\n of that kind of investment?\n\n07:42.740 --> 07:45.220\n Well, I think the benefits in some ways\n\n07:45.220 --> 07:48.980\n are they're professionals who are largely dispassionate.\n\n07:48.980 --> 07:51.380\n It's like, look, if you're hitting the numbers you told me\n\n07:51.380 --> 07:54.080\n and you're hitting your plan, great.\n\n07:55.300 --> 07:58.900\n And the other thing that always was interesting to me\n\n07:58.900 --> 08:02.480\n about the movie business is if I'm investing\n\n08:02.480 --> 08:04.300\n in an artificial intelligence company\n\n08:04.300 --> 08:06.460\n or a chipset company or something like that,\n\n08:07.780 --> 08:11.900\n a lot of the institutions don't have the technical expertise\n\n08:11.900 --> 08:16.380\n to really truly grasp what's being done.\n\n08:16.380 --> 08:19.280\n So they don't, other than good business practices,\n\n08:19.280 --> 08:21.700\n they're not offering every little opinion.\n\n08:21.700 --> 08:25.160\n The movies and television are completely approachable,\n\n08:25.160 --> 08:27.860\n meaning everybody has an opinion.\n\n08:27.860 --> 08:31.400\n So whether it's, I think you guys chose the wrong actor\n\n08:31.400 --> 08:33.500\n for that or why did you do that movie?\n\n08:34.500 --> 08:38.460\n So it invites a lot more sort of second guessing\n\n08:38.460 --> 08:39.480\n and things like that.\n\n08:39.480 --> 08:42.780\n So that was always one of the idiosyncrasies\n\n08:42.780 --> 08:46.400\n of the business that I thought was interesting.\n\n08:47.280 --> 08:50.220\n And then when you talk about private equity\n\n08:50.220 --> 08:52.820\n versus public equity, if you're a public company\n\n08:52.820 --> 08:56.140\n where the companies are traded,\n\n08:56.140 --> 08:59.500\n you wanna buy Microsoft shares, you just go to your broker,\n\n08:59.500 --> 09:01.780\n go on TD Ameritrade and buy them.\n\n09:01.780 --> 09:04.780\n If on the other hand, you're talking about private equity,\n\n09:04.780 --> 09:08.460\n that's institutions or individuals\n\n09:08.460 --> 09:11.140\n investing in private companies.\n\n09:11.140 --> 09:13.700\n So thus, if you have pools of capital\n\n09:13.700 --> 09:16.740\n that mostly invest in private equity deals,\n\n09:16.740 --> 09:18.540\n that's how you'd think about it.\n\n09:18.540 --> 09:20.180\n It's difficult to make those happen\n\n09:20.180 --> 09:23.540\n because it's individuals, you have to sort of,\n\n09:23.540 --> 09:26.460\n what, have dinners and agree.\n\n09:26.460 --> 09:31.140\n So it's much less, it's much more human,\n\n09:31.140 --> 09:33.580\n much less mechanical, I would say.\n\n09:33.580 --> 09:36.020\n Yeah, now, and again, massive difference\n\n09:36.020 --> 09:41.020\n between large private equity shops who are professionalized\n\n09:41.060 --> 09:44.400\n and in the same category that I mentioned earlier\n\n09:44.400 --> 09:49.300\n versus private individuals who are wealthy or whatever.\n\n09:49.300 --> 09:51.980\n But again, it's much more individualized\n\n09:51.980 --> 09:55.740\n when you're going to people who like your idea\n\n09:55.740 --> 09:58.460\n and just say, I'd like to invest in this.\n\n09:58.460 --> 10:01.900\n Is that, from all the kinds of investments you've seen,\n\n10:03.500 --> 10:05.200\n what do you think is the most conducive\n\n10:05.200 --> 10:08.660\n to creating works of genius,\n\n10:08.660 --> 10:11.100\n whether that's in technology, AI space,\n\n10:11.100 --> 10:12.820\n or whether that's in movies?\n\n10:12.820 --> 10:15.020\n So creating something special in this world.\n\n10:16.100 --> 10:18.800\n I would say a couple of things.\n\n10:18.800 --> 10:23.800\n Enough money that whatever endeavor you're going into,\n\n10:23.800 --> 10:27.720\n that you're not so nervous about the edges, right?\n\n10:27.720 --> 10:32.240\n If I have $100 to spend and I think I can create\n\n10:32.240 --> 10:36.360\n a perpetual motion machine or something for $104,\n\n10:37.240 --> 10:39.880\n I can't do it because they're all over me about the budget.\n\n10:39.880 --> 10:43.480\n So I would say making sure that you have enough capital,\n\n10:43.480 --> 10:46.640\n making sure that that capital is patient enough\n\n10:46.640 --> 10:48.640\n so that it's, if you're gonna do things\n\n10:48.640 --> 10:52.280\n that are extraordinary, it takes some time.\n\n10:52.280 --> 10:55.080\n And you're gonna break stuff, right?\n\n10:55.080 --> 10:56.160\n You're gonna make mistakes,\n\n10:56.160 --> 10:58.800\n you're gonna have a whole bunch of film\n\n10:58.800 --> 11:00.480\n on the cutting room floor, so to speak,\n\n11:00.480 --> 11:01.520\n or if you're in the lab,\n\n11:01.520 --> 11:04.140\n you're gonna have a whole bunch of broken stuff.\n\n11:04.140 --> 11:07.640\n And I also think it's very important at the beginning,\n\n11:07.640 --> 11:10.400\n and I always try to do this with companies I invest in\n\n11:10.400 --> 11:15.400\n or buy, is make sure that you have a philosophical\n\n11:15.520 --> 11:20.080\n and somewhat mechanical alignment with the management team.\n\n11:20.080 --> 11:23.800\n So that going in, you both understand,\n\n11:23.800 --> 11:26.280\n hey, this is how we think about this problem\n\n11:26.280 --> 11:30.520\n or this company, this is what we feel like our culture is,\n\n11:30.520 --> 11:32.760\n this is what our goal is, and these are the metrics\n\n11:32.760 --> 11:35.640\n by which we'll agree to measure them by.\n\n11:35.640 --> 11:39.680\n Because if you don't have that shared,\n\n11:39.680 --> 11:42.680\n you know, hey, we're gonna take this journey,\n\n11:42.680 --> 11:45.280\n then I think that's where people get upset,\n\n11:45.280 --> 11:47.060\n disappointed, et cetera.\n\n11:47.060 --> 11:50.920\n What about, this is a weird question, but constraints.\n\n11:50.920 --> 11:53.280\n So this is both for filmmaking and investment.\n\n11:54.640 --> 11:57.020\n Do you think more money is always better?\n\n11:57.020 --> 11:58.500\n No.\n\n11:58.500 --> 12:01.840\n So I like constraints a lot.\n\n12:01.840 --> 12:06.360\n It's like constraints and almost like a desperation,\n\n12:06.360 --> 12:10.480\n and deadlines are catalysts for creativity,\n\n12:10.480 --> 12:15.220\n for productivity, for sort of innovation.\n\n12:15.220 --> 12:19.080\n So can you kind of speak to that as an investor,\n\n12:19.080 --> 12:23.400\n as a creator, like what's the right balance here?\n\n12:23.400 --> 12:27.600\n Well, I think if you're focused on a particular problem\n\n12:27.600 --> 12:31.960\n or a company or a thesis, if you have that focus\n\n12:31.960 --> 12:36.120\n and you feel like I have unlimited resources\n\n12:36.120 --> 12:39.220\n or renewable resources, so there's really,\n\n12:39.220 --> 12:43.520\n there's no leverage in the situation, right?\n\n12:43.520 --> 12:47.240\n There's no, if I fail at this,\n\n12:47.240 --> 12:49.440\n I'll just go get more money, right?\n\n12:49.440 --> 12:54.040\n I'll just go, I think that's a hard way to be resilient\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:58.520\n and to think of new ways to solve problems.\n\n13:00.720 --> 13:05.200\n So I think capitalizing things just, you know,\n\n13:05.200 --> 13:08.640\n to the nth degree does create some problems.\n\n13:08.640 --> 13:11.320\n So I think there's that perfect blend of\n\n13:11.320 --> 13:14.000\n don't starve the oxygen to the point\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:15.960\n where you make short term decisions\n\n13:15.960 --> 13:18.720\n or non strategic or thoughtful decisions\n\n13:18.720 --> 13:20.360\n because you gotta pay the rent.\n\n13:20.360 --> 13:24.880\n And on the other hand, you can't have it be like this,\n\n13:24.880 --> 13:28.940\n you know, everlasting gobstopper of whatever you want\n\n13:28.940 --> 13:30.400\n will just keep flowing the cash\n\n13:30.400 --> 13:33.080\n because that doesn't create any friction points\n\n13:33.080 --> 13:38.080\n that I think do result in works of genius,\n\n13:38.080 --> 13:42.580\n works of genius in things that, you know,\n\n13:42.580 --> 13:44.260\n that are transformative.\n\n13:44.260 --> 13:48.460\n And one of the things that is interesting to me\n\n13:48.460 --> 13:52.540\n about society sort of writ large is\n\n13:54.100 --> 13:57.100\n I think that when you go through hard times\n\n13:59.020 --> 14:02.260\n and you have to do things that are uncomfortable\n\n14:02.260 --> 14:04.980\n and you don't wanna do them because you're tired,\n\n14:04.980 --> 14:09.020\n because you're, that in some ways builds up that\n\n14:09.020 --> 14:12.720\n you're comfortable being uncomfortable muscle.\n\n14:12.720 --> 14:17.720\n And I sometimes think we're losing that a little bit\n\n14:17.920 --> 14:20.880\n and you can't sort of paint with a wide brush,\n\n14:20.880 --> 14:25.480\n but you know, that's one of the things\n\n14:25.480 --> 14:30.300\n that I kind of observe and hope that we don't go that way.\n\n14:30.300 --> 14:34.220\n I do think challenge and discomfort are a kind of gift\n\n14:34.220 --> 14:36.940\n because like overcoming that,\n\n14:36.940 --> 14:39.040\n it's like from every perspective,\n\n14:39.040 --> 14:41.320\n from a human perspective, it's a source of happiness\n\n14:41.320 --> 14:43.780\n and fulfillment, overcoming challenge.\n\n14:43.780 --> 14:45.840\n But from a business perspective,\n\n14:45.840 --> 14:48.860\n I see like if something is really difficult,\n\n14:48.860 --> 14:51.740\n to me it's also a sign that most others would,\n\n14:51.740 --> 14:54.400\n or many others would fail at this point.\n\n14:54.400 --> 14:55.920\n So like it's a feature.\n\n14:55.920 --> 14:58.120\n It's nice that something is difficult.\n\n14:58.120 --> 15:02.100\n When people tell you that something is impossible,\n\n15:02.100 --> 15:03.980\n I love that because it's like, all right,\n\n15:03.980 --> 15:06.980\n well then that's what a lot of people would believe.\n\n15:06.980 --> 15:09.540\n And that gives you an opportunity to be the person\n\n15:09.540 --> 15:11.120\n who shows it's not impossible.\n\n15:11.120 --> 15:12.800\n And you, of course you might be wrong,\n\n15:12.800 --> 15:14.120\n but if you're not wrong,\n\n15:14.120 --> 15:15.600\n you have the opportunity to stand out.\n\n15:15.600 --> 15:18.840\n So going through that hardship, taking those big risks,\n\n15:18.840 --> 15:20.400\n it's going to really pay off.\n\n15:20.400 --> 15:25.400\n So like discomfort is a feature, not a bug\n\n15:26.760 --> 15:30.120\n of both personal life, it's just good for life,\n\n15:30.120 --> 15:34.760\n but for business, it seems like just good business sense.\n\n15:34.760 --> 15:38.620\n If something is hard, it's probably a good idea to do that.\n\n15:38.620 --> 15:39.460\n Yeah.\n\n15:39.460 --> 15:41.560\n Because most others will fail.\n\n15:41.560 --> 15:42.400\n Fun question.\n\n15:42.400 --> 15:43.520\n I don't know if you can answer this,\n\n15:43.520 --> 15:46.160\n but what's the most expensive movie\n\n15:46.160 --> 15:48.040\n you were involved with to make?\n\n15:48.040 --> 15:50.860\n And why was it, you don't have to say numbers,\n\n15:50.860 --> 15:53.160\n but like is something stand out\n\n15:53.160 --> 15:57.380\n as being exceptionally expensive and why is it expensive?\n\n15:57.380 --> 16:01.500\n Um, I think Jurassic World was pretty expensive.\n\n16:01.500 --> 16:02.340\n Nice.\n\n16:02.340 --> 16:04.220\n I mean, worked out great.\n\n16:05.740 --> 16:06.940\n And, uh.\n\n16:06.940 --> 16:09.580\n That's an epic film, by the way.\n\n16:09.580 --> 16:13.900\n It, look, it's one of my favorites.\n\n16:13.900 --> 16:16.180\n They just did an amazing job.\n\n16:16.180 --> 16:20.400\n And frankly, the crazy thing about my life\n\n16:20.400 --> 16:23.060\n is all the stuff that I loved as a kid\n\n16:23.060 --> 16:27.240\n somehow came full circle back into my adult life.\n\n16:27.240 --> 16:31.300\n And having the opportunity while I was out there\n\n16:31.300 --> 16:35.220\n to develop a friendship with Steven Spielberg\n\n16:35.220 --> 16:39.120\n and then have my name on the same film as Steven Spielberg.\n\n16:39.120 --> 16:42.760\n I mean, that was pretty surreal.\n\n16:44.320 --> 16:46.900\n So that was an expensive film.\n\n16:46.900 --> 16:49.820\n You know, Dark Knight Rises was an expensive film.\n\n16:49.820 --> 16:51.660\n But again, to me, there's a difference\n\n16:51.660 --> 16:54.480\n between expensive and irresponsible,\n\n16:54.480 --> 16:58.540\n and expensive because the vision warranted\n\n16:58.540 --> 17:01.180\n and it turned out financially it certainly did.\n\n17:01.180 --> 17:02.780\n Yeah, with Jurassic World, it's.\n\n17:04.340 --> 17:06.420\n I mean, I can't even imagine having those meetings\n\n17:06.420 --> 17:08.980\n because like you have to create so much\n\n17:08.980 --> 17:11.100\n and so much of it is obviously not real.\n\n17:11.100 --> 17:14.200\n You can't bring dinosaurs in a.\n\n17:14.200 --> 17:15.780\n Yeah.\n\n17:15.780 --> 17:17.460\n Is that where a lot of the cost is,\n\n17:17.460 --> 17:22.460\n is in the computer side of things?\n\n17:22.460 --> 17:26.040\n Yeah, those are generally pretty massive components\n\n17:26.040 --> 17:30.080\n of the budget, and especially if you're doing it\n\n17:30.080 --> 17:32.640\n and inventing things as you go.\n\n17:32.640 --> 17:36.440\n I mean, Jim Cameron is one of those filmmakers\n\n17:36.440 --> 17:41.440\n who is designing the plane as it's flying\n\n17:41.480 --> 17:43.840\n in such a brilliant way.\n\n17:43.840 --> 17:47.440\n And I've got to know him over the years\n\n17:47.440 --> 17:51.280\n and just in awe of the way his brain works.\n\n17:51.280 --> 17:55.280\n And so yeah, it's a big component.\n\n17:55.280 --> 17:57.000\n Can you speak a little bit more to him\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:01.040\n in terms of, because you're such a fascinating person\n\n18:01.040 --> 18:02.920\n because you care a lot about technology.\n\n18:02.920 --> 18:06.000\n You care a lot about the cutting edge of technology.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.280\n So how does he, a creator, a director,\n\n18:10.280 --> 18:12.440\n build the plane while it's flying?\n\n18:12.440 --> 18:15.600\n Like what's the role of innovation in this whole process?\n\n18:15.600 --> 18:20.040\n Well, so I never made a film with Jim.\n\n18:20.040 --> 18:22.640\n I'm just a huge fan and got to know him\n\n18:23.800 --> 18:26.340\n and John Landau, his producing partner.\n\n18:27.360 --> 18:31.360\n And one of the things that just fascinates me about Jim is,\n\n18:31.360 --> 18:34.960\n so he makes Titanic and there's a bunch of underwater cameras\n\n18:34.960 --> 18:37.520\n and things that they need that don't exist.\n\n18:37.520 --> 18:42.520\n So he goes and invents them and has a good grasp\n\n18:42.560 --> 18:46.060\n of engineering and has not only the imagination,\n\n18:46.060 --> 18:50.420\n but the ability to lead a team to build them.\n\n18:50.420 --> 18:53.940\n I got to go down early when they were shooting Avatar\n\n18:55.020 --> 18:57.920\n at a warehouse, I think it was, where they were shooting.\n\n18:57.920 --> 19:02.000\n And as they were explaining to me how they were capturing it\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.700\n and that they could go back later\n\n19:03.700 --> 19:08.540\n because they created the environment, it blew my mind.\n\n19:08.540 --> 19:11.160\n And I said, okay, this is truly,\n\n19:11.160 --> 19:13.000\n people talk about a big leap.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.040\n This certainly is one.\n\n19:14.040 --> 19:18.720\n So he has continued to push the envelope\n\n19:18.720 --> 19:20.940\n in terms of the art of the possible.\n\n19:20.940 --> 19:24.760\n And I just think he's an incredible genius in that way.\n\n19:26.200 --> 19:27.760\n Again, another hard question.\n\n19:27.760 --> 19:32.060\n So you, in the realm of music, care about story, storytelling.\n\n19:33.520 --> 19:37.320\n Is there some aspect in which money\n\n19:37.320 --> 19:40.060\n and beautiful graphics get in the way of story?\n\n19:40.060 --> 19:45.060\n In filmmaking, so if you think about Jurassic World,\n\n19:47.140 --> 19:49.900\n obviously that's an experience like any other.\n\n19:52.380 --> 19:54.780\n Like what do you think about the tension\n\n19:54.780 --> 19:59.780\n between story, experience and like visual effects?\n\n20:01.460 --> 20:06.460\n Well, look, if you're using big effect shots\n\n20:06.460 --> 20:10.560\n and all kinds of tricks to cover over the fact\n\n20:10.560 --> 20:13.640\n that you don't have a very interesting story to tell,\n\n20:13.640 --> 20:15.760\n that's where I think it gets in the way.\n\n20:17.720 --> 20:21.800\n Where I think you have these incredible filmmakers,\n\n20:21.800 --> 20:23.520\n we mentioned Chris Nolan and Jim Cameron,\n\n20:23.520 --> 20:28.520\n Guillermo del Toro, you could go on and on,\n\n20:28.520 --> 20:33.520\n folks that just see the world differently\n\n20:33.520 --> 20:38.520\n and use technology to enhance the storytelling, right?\n\n20:38.820 --> 20:41.780\n To make you believe differently,\n\n20:42.660 --> 20:46.820\n rather to make you not just suspend your disbelief,\n\n20:46.820 --> 20:49.420\n but to feel like you're immersed in it.\n\n20:49.420 --> 20:52.260\n So I've certainly seen it done expertly\n\n20:52.260 --> 20:53.820\n and I've seen it done poorly.\n\n20:54.620 --> 20:57.460\n You've talked about this a little bit in the past.\n\n20:57.460 --> 21:02.140\n You kind of left the moviemaking business\n\n21:02.140 --> 21:05.660\n at an interesting time, perhaps you saw the changes.\n\n21:07.060 --> 21:10.120\n There's been a lot of excitement with Netflix, with TV,\n\n21:10.120 --> 21:13.860\n so the role of film in society has changed.\n\n21:13.860 --> 21:18.180\n So what do you think is the future of movies versus TV?\n\n21:18.180 --> 21:21.460\n Like if you were as a business person, as a creator,\n\n21:21.460 --> 21:24.820\n as a consumer, as a technologist,\n\n21:24.820 --> 21:27.500\n are thinking about the next 10, 20 years,\n\n21:27.500 --> 21:31.960\n what do you think is going to be the godfather,\n\n21:31.960 --> 21:36.060\n the great pieces that move us as a society\n\n21:36.060 --> 21:37.320\n in the next 10, 20 years?\n\n21:37.320 --> 21:38.220\n Is it going to be TV?\n\n21:38.220 --> 21:39.660\n Is it going to be movie?\n\n21:39.660 --> 21:43.660\n Is it going to be a TikTok clips?\n\n21:43.660 --> 21:44.600\n What is it?\n\n21:44.600 --> 21:48.540\n Well, so, and I think the other category\n\n21:48.540 --> 21:52.260\n that I would add to that, that will be the next great medium\n\n21:52.260 --> 21:55.020\n is truly immersive virtual reality\n\n21:55.980 --> 22:00.500\n in which new storytellers will emerge,\n\n22:00.500 --> 22:02.940\n especially when you can go into VR\n\n22:03.820 --> 22:08.260\n and there's enough computing power to sustain it\n\n22:08.260 --> 22:10.340\n and to allow it to be social\n\n22:10.340 --> 22:14.680\n and for you to have different paths to go down.\n\n22:14.680 --> 22:17.020\n That'll be, I think, the next realm\n\n22:17.020 --> 22:20.100\n of what storytelling and experience will look like.\n\n22:20.100 --> 22:22.140\n Do you think a video game kind of world\n\n22:22.140 --> 22:26.180\n or is it more movies or is it more social network\n\n22:26.180 --> 22:30.780\n or is it all of it kind of blending reality and gaming\n\n22:30.780 --> 22:31.780\n and movies?\n\n22:31.780 --> 22:35.100\n Yeah, I thought if you saw Ready Player One,\n\n22:35.100 --> 22:37.820\n which I love the book and the movie was cool too,\n\n22:39.100 --> 22:42.980\n but that's one version of it, right?\n\n22:42.980 --> 22:46.220\n Where you go in, now everybody's talking about the metaverse\n\n22:46.220 --> 22:47.860\n and all that, but you go into a world\n\n22:47.860 --> 22:50.380\n that's fully rendered as yourself\n\n22:50.380 --> 22:51.540\n and you interact with that world.\n\n22:51.540 --> 22:54.840\n The other side of it is to go in somewhere\n\n22:54.840 --> 22:57.760\n between being a passive observer,\n\n22:57.760 --> 23:00.080\n but being able to move around your point of view\n\n23:00.080 --> 23:03.300\n and experiences, which I think is interesting.\n\n23:03.300 --> 23:07.120\n And then I think another adventure, so to speak,\n\n23:07.120 --> 23:10.340\n I could think of is a blend of video games.\n\n23:10.340 --> 23:12.020\n So there's a mission, right?\n\n23:12.020 --> 23:14.580\n There's obstacles, there's everything\n\n23:14.580 --> 23:17.900\n and you move through it, but it's immersive\n\n23:17.900 --> 23:19.640\n and it tells a story at the same time.\n\n23:19.640 --> 23:22.740\n And that's why I think you're gonna see\n\n23:22.740 --> 23:27.740\n new amazing storytellers that we don't know yet\n\n23:27.860 --> 23:29.740\n that understand how to innovate\n\n23:29.740 --> 23:32.860\n and how to make you feel something in that environment.\n\n23:34.540 --> 23:39.540\n And to your earlier point, I saw probably around 2015\n\n23:41.820 --> 23:46.820\n when Netflix decided to be bold, put out House of Cards,\n\n23:47.620 --> 23:50.660\n put out all the episodes, leave you in charge\n\n23:50.660 --> 23:52.740\n of the pace at which you would view them,\n\n23:53.740 --> 23:55.600\n which I thought was great.\n\n23:56.420 --> 23:57.780\n That was a gutsy move.\n\n23:57.780 --> 23:58.700\n Yes, it was.\n\n23:58.700 --> 24:00.600\n And I can't tell you around Hollywood,\n\n24:00.600 --> 24:03.060\n anybody that says that everybody thought it was a great idea\n\n24:03.060 --> 24:06.740\n is not being truthful because everybody I talked to\n\n24:06.740 --> 24:10.140\n said this is, they're idiots, right?\n\n24:10.140 --> 24:13.480\n What do they know about movie making and TV?\n\n24:13.480 --> 24:18.480\n And what I saw happening was if you look\n\n24:18.480 --> 24:21.300\n at what Netflix pulled off and they realized\n\n24:21.300 --> 24:24.740\n that there isn't really a moat around the studios,\n\n24:24.740 --> 24:29.580\n you really could make stuff and really good stuff.\n\n24:29.580 --> 24:31.940\n And so they started to create their own content\n\n24:32.820 --> 24:37.700\n that pulled in Amazon, which pulled in Google\n\n24:37.700 --> 24:40.580\n through YouTube and then you had Hulu,\n\n24:40.580 --> 24:43.260\n then you had Disney deciding\n\n24:43.260 --> 24:44.660\n that they're gonna have Disney Plus.\n\n24:44.660 --> 24:47.300\n And the next thing you know, you have some\n\n24:47.300 --> 24:50.300\n of the biggest companies with the largest balance sheets\n\n24:50.300 --> 24:54.060\n on the planet being in the creative business.\n\n24:55.620 --> 24:58.020\n If you're an independent, that's bringing a knife\n\n24:58.020 --> 25:00.580\n to a gunfight to be sure.\n\n25:00.580 --> 25:03.760\n And so I thought that was interesting.\n\n25:03.760 --> 25:06.880\n The other thing that it used to be that movies\n\n25:06.880 --> 25:08.360\n were where the big things happened\n\n25:08.360 --> 25:10.320\n and television was sort of,\n\n25:10.320 --> 25:13.140\n it was small screen, different experience.\n\n25:13.140 --> 25:15.780\n And you had something like Game of Thrones come out,\n\n25:15.780 --> 25:19.860\n which was not only on the same epic level visually\n\n25:19.860 --> 25:22.560\n and storytelling wise, but had the budget\n\n25:22.560 --> 25:24.040\n to be able to do it.\n\n25:24.040 --> 25:29.040\n And now I think you're seeing all kinds\n\n25:31.780 --> 25:35.780\n of different storytelling taking place.\n\n25:35.780 --> 25:40.460\n And I also like that you're not pigeonholed into a time.\n\n25:40.460 --> 25:42.620\n You got two hours to tell the story.\n\n25:42.620 --> 25:44.260\n You can do a three part mini series,\n\n25:44.260 --> 25:45.480\n a five part mini series.\n\n25:45.480 --> 25:49.340\n You can do television that's all kinds of different format.\n\n25:49.340 --> 25:53.500\n That I think allows creators\n\n25:53.500 --> 25:55.300\n to do a lot more interesting things.\n\n25:57.220 --> 25:59.780\n It is also interesting to consider the role\n\n25:59.780 --> 26:01.600\n of companies that enable that,\n\n26:01.600 --> 26:04.660\n like the capital that enables that.\n\n26:04.660 --> 26:08.140\n Without Netflix and HBO, you wouldn't have\n\n26:09.460 --> 26:11.340\n some of these epic shows.\n\n26:11.340 --> 26:14.340\n And so if we're thinking about the virtual reality world\n\n26:14.340 --> 26:15.700\n that you're talking about,\n\n26:16.700 --> 26:19.340\n it's interesting to consider who will enable that.\n\n26:19.340 --> 26:22.580\n Now, like you said, Facebook is talking about meta\n\n26:22.580 --> 26:25.580\n and metaverse, but it's unclear\n\n26:25.580 --> 26:28.720\n that just having money is enough.\n\n26:28.720 --> 26:31.580\n Netflix did a lot of really revolutionary stuff.\n\n26:33.020 --> 26:34.180\n Amazon has money.\n\n26:34.180 --> 26:35.380\n There's a lot of companies that have money\n\n26:35.380 --> 26:38.500\n that don't quite do as good of a job yet\n\n26:38.500 --> 26:43.500\n at enabling creators of creating revolutionary new content.\n\n26:44.540 --> 26:46.620\n That changes the whole industry.\n\n26:46.620 --> 26:48.100\n And that's probably going to be the case\n\n26:48.100 --> 26:49.420\n with virtual reality.\n\n26:49.420 --> 26:54.140\n There is a lot of money needed to enable experiences,\n\n26:54.140 --> 26:57.020\n like in terms of compute infrastructure.\n\n26:57.020 --> 26:59.540\n There needs to be a huge amount of money there,\n\n26:59.540 --> 27:02.860\n but you also need to somehow give freedom to creators\n\n27:02.860 --> 27:05.900\n to have fun, to do their best work,\n\n27:05.900 --> 27:10.900\n and at the same time provide the perfect amount\n\n27:11.620 --> 27:13.620\n of constraints, all of that together.\n\n27:13.620 --> 27:15.180\n However Netflix makes it happen,\n\n27:15.180 --> 27:16.460\n they do a pretty good job\n\n27:16.460 --> 27:18.880\n because it's a very constrained platform,\n\n27:18.880 --> 27:21.340\n but yet all the creators I've ever talked to,\n\n27:21.340 --> 27:24.300\n comedians and so on, that work with Netflix,\n\n27:24.300 --> 27:26.720\n are really happy because they feel free\n\n27:26.720 --> 27:27.900\n to create their work.\n\n27:27.900 --> 27:32.580\n Yeah, and I think a lot of times companies are a letterhead,\n\n27:32.580 --> 27:34.500\n but it boils down to the people.\n\n27:34.500 --> 27:38.700\n And I think I've known Ted Sarandos a long time\n\n27:38.700 --> 27:40.840\n who ran the studio at Netflix\n\n27:40.840 --> 27:44.420\n and now took over for Reed running the company.\n\n27:44.420 --> 27:47.620\n But Ted, very smart, talented guy,\n\n27:47.620 --> 27:50.880\n and understood early how to cultivate talent\n\n27:50.880 --> 27:53.540\n and relationships with talent, which is important.\n\n27:53.540 --> 27:56.220\n When you're dealing with creative people,\n\n27:56.220 --> 27:58.300\n their motivations and their goals\n\n27:58.300 --> 28:00.020\n are not always the same, right?\n\n28:00.020 --> 28:02.420\n They're not always capitalistic, right?\n\n28:02.420 --> 28:05.900\n And so in terms of being able to communicate\n\n28:05.900 --> 28:10.640\n with creative people that are not always A to B to C\n\n28:10.640 --> 28:11.940\n is a talent.\n\n28:11.940 --> 28:14.180\n And so I think they did a great job.\n\n28:14.180 --> 28:16.300\n Ted did a great job with that early.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:21.460\n But I think that you're gonna see different formats.\n\n28:21.460 --> 28:26.200\n I don't think, I mean, going to a theater\n\n28:26.200 --> 28:30.580\n to see a massive movie on that screen in that format\n\n28:30.580 --> 28:33.260\n is a fundamentally different experience.\n\n28:33.260 --> 28:36.180\n And I think you're gonna find movies,\n\n28:36.180 --> 28:38.800\n my old shop, Legendary, just put out Dune,\n\n28:38.800 --> 28:41.380\n which I thought was phenomenal.\n\n28:43.980 --> 28:46.660\n When we secured the rights to Dune years ago,\n\n28:48.700 --> 28:51.420\n I was over the moon because I love the book.\n\n28:51.420 --> 28:56.420\n I love the entire world that is Dune.\n\n28:57.180 --> 28:59.920\n And that's a movie that I think you see on the big screen.\n\n28:59.920 --> 29:03.300\n I think when Avatar 2 comes out,\n\n29:03.300 --> 29:06.020\n I wanna see that on a big screen.\n\n29:06.020 --> 29:09.600\n But I think you're gonna see a ton of content\n\n29:09.600 --> 29:11.420\n is obviously being produced,\n\n29:11.420 --> 29:14.140\n and it's not all gonna go to a theater going experience.\n\n29:14.140 --> 29:17.180\n So you're gonna see, I think, different versions of this\n\n29:17.180 --> 29:18.760\n over the next five to 10 years.\n\n29:19.740 --> 29:22.100\n In case James Cameron is listening to this,\n\n29:22.100 --> 29:25.260\n so he officially agreed to talk at the time of,\n\n29:25.260 --> 29:27.820\n on this podcast, at the time of Avatar 2 release.\n\n29:27.820 --> 29:30.660\n I'm just holding you to that in this recorded conversation.\n\n29:31.860 --> 29:36.520\n Also just super excited, both the movie and the director.\n\n29:38.240 --> 29:41.500\n There's something special about movies.\n\n29:41.500 --> 29:46.500\n They win Oscars, they're historic in nature.\n\n29:46.760 --> 29:48.500\n There's something about TV shows,\n\n29:48.500 --> 29:50.980\n even when they're epic like Game of Thrones,\n\n29:50.980 --> 29:54.360\n that they're forgotten much quicker in history.\n\n29:54.360 --> 29:56.500\n I don't know, maybe that's because we haven't had\n\n29:56.500 --> 30:00.180\n enough of them, but the De Niro performances,\n\n30:00.180 --> 30:04.260\n and the Scorsese films, all the great films\n\n30:04.260 --> 30:07.300\n that we think of throughout the generations\n\n30:07.300 --> 30:10.280\n that define generations are films.\n\n30:10.280 --> 30:12.980\n Is that just old school thinking?\n\n30:12.980 --> 30:14.100\n Is that always going to be the case?\n\n30:14.100 --> 30:19.100\n I mean, look, to me, going in a darkened theater\n\n30:20.060 --> 30:23.220\n with a bunch of strangers, and the lights go down,\n\n30:23.220 --> 30:28.020\n and you go on this journey, there is something special\n\n30:28.020 --> 30:29.980\n and magical about that.\n\n30:29.980 --> 30:33.460\n And I think movies have been a part\n\n30:33.460 --> 30:36.060\n of our cultural fabric forever.\n\n30:36.060 --> 30:39.420\n And for some reason, Hollywood in America\n\n30:40.340 --> 30:45.340\n was uniquely positioned to do a great job with it.\n\n30:46.260 --> 30:48.060\n Not that there aren't great foreign movies,\n\n30:48.060 --> 30:53.060\n but far and away, American movies dominate,\n\n30:53.060 --> 30:55.580\n not only the world market, but you know,\n\n30:55.580 --> 30:58.260\n and so whatever it is that we do well,\n\n30:58.260 --> 31:02.540\n or Hollywood does well, there's something\n\n31:02.540 --> 31:03.540\n in the water, apparently.\n\n31:03.540 --> 31:07.820\n But I agree that I love movies,\n\n31:07.820 --> 31:10.540\n and I will for the rest of my days.\n\n31:10.540 --> 31:13.420\n It's interesting how creators can move\n\n31:13.420 --> 31:15.580\n back and forth now as well.\n\n31:15.580 --> 31:17.260\n That used to be a complete no no.\n\n31:17.260 --> 31:20.140\n You're either a movie guy, or you're a person,\n\n31:20.140 --> 31:24.580\n or you're a TV director, and that's that.\n\n31:24.580 --> 31:27.620\n But those lines have completely blurred.\n\n31:27.620 --> 31:29.700\n And they're also blurring, I mean,\n\n31:29.700 --> 31:31.100\n they're blurring all kinds of lines.\n\n31:31.100 --> 31:35.180\n Like they're moving to TikTok and Instagram,\n\n31:35.180 --> 31:38.580\n and I know right now it seems ridiculous\n\n31:38.580 --> 31:42.700\n to consider that these one minute things\n\n31:43.660 --> 31:47.300\n could be considered even in the same realm creatively\n\n31:47.300 --> 31:50.580\n as a film, but maybe that changes over time too.\n\n31:50.580 --> 31:53.220\n Maybe experiences can completely become fluid\n\n31:53.220 --> 31:56.780\n in terms of their size, as long as they have\n\n31:56.780 --> 32:01.100\n some deep lasting impact on you as a human being,\n\n32:01.100 --> 32:02.160\n as a consumer.\n\n32:02.160 --> 32:06.300\n Look, to me, the whole thing is about\n\n32:06.300 --> 32:09.100\n either the moving image, or even sometimes a picture\n\n32:09.980 --> 32:13.440\n will bring out an emotion, a reaction, something.\n\n32:13.440 --> 32:18.260\n So short form is harder, because you have less time\n\n32:18.260 --> 32:19.540\n to set things up and all that.\n\n32:19.540 --> 32:22.820\n But I'm sure there will be short videos\n\n32:22.820 --> 32:24.580\n and creators that come up with things,\n\n32:24.580 --> 32:29.540\n and if a moving image can get a reaction out of you,\n\n32:29.540 --> 32:31.140\n and make you feel a certain way,\n\n32:31.140 --> 32:33.780\n and stay with you, or inspire you,\n\n32:33.780 --> 32:36.400\n well, that to me is just the next evolution\n\n32:36.400 --> 32:39.140\n of whatever it's gonna be between humans\n\n32:39.140 --> 32:41.060\n and cameras, et cetera.\n\n32:41.060 --> 32:44.700\n See, I think that's why we've talked offline about this.\n\n32:44.700 --> 32:47.940\n That's why I love robots, is I think there's certain things\n\n32:47.940 --> 32:51.180\n in the short form with robots that immediately\n\n32:51.180 --> 32:54.000\n can bring out a feeling in people.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:57.520\n There's something about our consideration\n\n32:57.520 --> 33:01.140\n of our own intelligence, of our own consciousness,\n\n33:01.140 --> 33:04.820\n of all the fears and hopes, and the beautiful things\n\n33:04.820 --> 33:07.820\n about human nature, the dark things about human nature\n\n33:07.820 --> 33:11.780\n that somehow, especially Lego robots bring out.\n\n33:11.780 --> 33:15.380\n Because we have both a fear and excitement towards that.\n\n33:15.380 --> 33:17.380\n Are these going to be our overlords,\n\n33:17.380 --> 33:20.760\n our gods that overtake humanity?\n\n33:20.760 --> 33:24.380\n Are these going to be things like horses\n\n33:24.380 --> 33:27.140\n or something like that, something that empower humanity?\n\n33:27.140 --> 33:28.980\n Like you don't know what to make sense of it.\n\n33:28.980 --> 33:30.900\n That's why they're super exciting.\n\n33:30.900 --> 33:31.740\n I agree.\n\n33:31.740 --> 33:35.120\n Speaking of robots and film, you've gone\n\n33:35.120 --> 33:38.060\n into traditional industries and disrupted them\n\n33:38.060 --> 33:39.460\n quite a few times.\n\n33:40.300 --> 33:43.060\n Was there, is there a system for deciding\n\n33:43.060 --> 33:45.780\n which industry is right for disruption?\n\n33:45.780 --> 33:49.020\n When you look at the world and see\n\n33:49.020 --> 33:52.460\n what are the big problems you would like to solve,\n\n33:53.740 --> 33:56.580\n do you have a system of how you see which problems to solve?\n\n33:56.580 --> 33:58.960\n How do you look at the world?\n\n33:58.960 --> 34:01.400\n Yeah, well, on the business side of that,\n\n34:02.420 --> 34:04.580\n so I have a holding company called Tolko,\n\n34:04.580 --> 34:07.380\n I know, very imaginatively named.\n\n34:07.380 --> 34:11.540\n Part of that is literally every name ever is now taken,\n\n34:11.540 --> 34:13.220\n registered and all that stuff.\n\n34:14.380 --> 34:16.820\n So we're a holding company.\n\n34:16.820 --> 34:18.020\n What's a holding company?\n\n34:18.020 --> 34:21.360\n So instead of being a fund that has money flowing\n\n34:21.360 --> 34:24.940\n in and out of it, and there's what's called a vintage year,\n\n34:24.940 --> 34:28.620\n I raise capital and I agree to invest that capital\n\n34:28.620 --> 34:30.720\n for so long, and then I give it back to you,\n\n34:30.720 --> 34:33.700\n which sometimes creates artificial time pressures\n\n34:33.700 --> 34:34.540\n and things like that.\n\n34:34.540 --> 34:38.140\n A holding company is more permanent capital.\n\n34:38.140 --> 34:41.460\n So the idea was, behind Tolko,\n\n34:41.460 --> 34:44.820\n was to buy almost always whole companies\n\n34:44.820 --> 34:47.880\n or majority stakes with great management teams\n\n34:47.880 --> 34:50.300\n in spaces that did not traditionally\n\n34:50.300 --> 34:52.100\n have a lot of innovation.\n\n34:53.240 --> 34:57.700\n And to have our labs group, who were data scientists,\n\n34:57.700 --> 35:02.700\n AI practitioners, engineers, machine learning, et cetera,\n\n35:02.700 --> 35:07.340\n and to be able to bring that wherewithal to that company.\n\n35:07.340 --> 35:10.400\n So to provide them with the right capital\n\n35:10.400 --> 35:13.340\n and to provide them with access to technology,\n\n35:13.340 --> 35:17.820\n that would be hard to individually recruit for that company.\n\n35:17.820 --> 35:22.460\n So I would say that the thesis was to look\n\n35:22.460 --> 35:24.820\n for industries that were large enough,\n\n35:24.820 --> 35:27.220\n that hadn't traditionally had access\n\n35:27.220 --> 35:30.480\n to that type of technology or innovation,\n\n35:30.480 --> 35:34.460\n and to try to look for companies that not only\n\n35:35.700 --> 35:38.780\n looked that part, but had management teams\n\n35:38.780 --> 35:41.980\n that embraced this and wanted to take that kind of journey.\n\n35:41.980 --> 35:44.740\n Yeah, there is quite a few industries like that,\n\n35:44.740 --> 35:49.740\n but that finding the industries and the management pair,\n\n35:52.060 --> 35:54.060\n because those industries often have\n\n35:54.060 --> 35:56.360\n a lot of old school folks who don't,\n\n35:57.660 --> 35:59.100\n it takes quite a bit of work for them\n\n35:59.100 --> 36:00.860\n to leap into technology.\n\n36:00.860 --> 36:03.620\n I work quite a bit with the autonomous vehicles\n\n36:03.620 --> 36:06.040\n and just the automotive industry.\n\n36:06.040 --> 36:08.840\n Depending on the company, there's old school folks.\n\n36:08.840 --> 36:11.380\n It's like Detroit thinking versus like,\n\n36:11.380 --> 36:14.360\n what do you call it, I don't know, California thinking.\n\n36:15.220 --> 36:18.780\n Well, I think you have to look at the nexus\n\n36:18.780 --> 36:19.620\n of two things there.\n\n36:19.620 --> 36:22.620\n One is just plain old human behavior.\n\n36:22.620 --> 36:27.620\n If I am uncomfortable and this isn't a comfort zone for me\n\n36:27.620 --> 36:31.180\n and it's not something I have as a field of expertise,\n\n36:31.180 --> 36:33.260\n I'm gonna shy away from that.\n\n36:33.260 --> 36:36.700\n Especially if I'm successful and I feel good about myself\n\n36:36.700 --> 36:38.660\n and it's a big successful company or person\n\n36:38.660 --> 36:39.860\n or whatever it might be.\n\n36:41.540 --> 36:44.780\n And the second thing is that especially\n\n36:44.780 --> 36:46.580\n if you're a public company and you're being weighed\n\n36:46.580 --> 36:49.580\n and measured every quarter, you are rewarding\n\n36:49.580 --> 36:53.420\n the managers of that company to hit metrics\n\n36:53.420 --> 36:55.620\n and to be reliable and to say, hey,\n\n36:55.620 --> 36:57.260\n I'm counting quarter to quarter\n\n36:57.260 --> 36:59.760\n that you're gonna deliver what you say.\n\n37:00.820 --> 37:03.380\n It's difficult to say, you know what, everybody,\n\n37:03.380 --> 37:05.660\n for the next two years, I wouldn't count\n\n37:05.660 --> 37:08.380\n on our financial projections at all\n\n37:08.380 --> 37:10.740\n because we're gonna reinvent what we're doing.\n\n37:10.740 --> 37:14.060\n It's gonna work in the long run and you're gonna see\n\n37:14.060 --> 37:15.700\n that this was a really smart investment\n\n37:15.700 --> 37:17.140\n five to seven years from now.\n\n37:18.740 --> 37:22.800\n That's not the way capitalism is currently wired,\n\n37:22.800 --> 37:24.280\n generally, right?\n\n37:24.280 --> 37:28.180\n And a lot of, so again, if you reward managers\n\n37:28.180 --> 37:30.540\n with yearly bonuses and stock options\n\n37:30.540 --> 37:35.540\n based and tied to stock price and all these other things,\n\n37:35.560 --> 37:38.260\n you know, and then ask them to go break stuff,\n\n37:39.460 --> 37:41.140\n that's hard, I think.\n\n37:41.140 --> 37:46.140\n So you're saying like, so the talker approach\n\n37:46.500 --> 37:50.140\n to this, the private investment is the best way\n\n37:50.140 --> 37:53.100\n or perhaps the only way to enable this kind\n\n37:53.100 --> 37:55.260\n of long term innovation, investment,\n\n37:55.260 --> 37:57.620\n taking big risks, investing in innovation.\n\n37:57.620 --> 38:01.260\n Well, look, we certainly are not, by any means,\n\n38:01.260 --> 38:02.340\n the only one doing it.\n\n38:02.340 --> 38:06.460\n I'm just saying that when you think about big companies,\n\n38:06.460 --> 38:10.900\n more successful, you know, that are in old line businesses,\n\n38:10.900 --> 38:13.380\n and I hear people sort of talk about,\n\n38:13.380 --> 38:15.140\n well, why can't they just pivot?\n\n38:15.140 --> 38:19.380\n They recognize they need to be in the technology business\n\n38:19.380 --> 38:23.140\n because it's hard, it's hard to steer a ship and turn it\n\n38:23.140 --> 38:25.660\n that big, and especially if it's not part\n\n38:25.660 --> 38:27.720\n of your DNA at that company.\n\n38:28.700 --> 38:33.660\n So, you know, I just think that what we tried to do\n\n38:33.660 --> 38:38.660\n is to enable management teams that know\n\n38:38.980 --> 38:43.260\n where they wanna go and to be patient with capital\n\n38:43.260 --> 38:48.260\n and also, again, bring innovation to bear\n\n38:48.260 --> 38:50.700\n that they have access to.\n\n38:50.700 --> 38:52.660\n There's plenty of capital structures\n\n38:52.660 --> 38:54.360\n doing interesting things.\n\n38:54.360 --> 38:57.500\n That's one of the things I love about our country.\n\n38:57.500 --> 39:01.700\n This country innovates and this country invents things,\n\n39:01.700 --> 39:06.700\n and I'm constantly in awe of just the, you know,\n\n39:08.460 --> 39:13.460\n the human ability to innovate and to iterate.\n\n39:14.500 --> 39:18.020\n You know, I get to hang around some universities,\n\n39:18.020 --> 39:20.580\n including your old shop, MIT, and it's like.\n\n39:20.580 --> 39:21.420\n I'm still there.\n\n39:21.420 --> 39:22.240\n Yeah, you're still there.\n\n39:22.240 --> 39:23.180\n Still there, still teaching there.\n\n39:23.180 --> 39:26.180\n Still teaching, but that place is like Hogwarts.\n\n39:26.180 --> 39:30.680\n I mean, it's just, it's inspiring, right?\n\n39:30.680 --> 39:34.060\n And certainly the energy in Silicon Valley,\n\n39:34.060 --> 39:37.420\n which now Austin, Texas, where we're sitting,\n\n39:37.420 --> 39:40.740\n has its own incredible ecosystem.\n\n39:40.740 --> 39:45.060\n So that's one of the things I love about America\n\n39:45.060 --> 39:49.180\n is the ability, and that really is, I think,\n\n39:49.180 --> 39:53.700\n in the American DNA, to create things and invent things,\n\n39:53.700 --> 39:55.940\n and I just, I think that's invigorating.\n\n39:55.940 --> 39:58.220\n And I think that's even bigger than capitalism,\n\n39:58.220 --> 40:01.460\n sort of the machine of how capitalism works.\n\n40:01.460 --> 40:02.900\n That's just human nature.\n\n40:02.900 --> 40:04.580\n Capitalism is just one of the ways\n\n40:04.580 --> 40:09.580\n to sort of make that human nature shine, I suppose,\n\n40:10.020 --> 40:12.840\n but it's like, you mentioned MIT.\n\n40:12.840 --> 40:17.840\n There's a drive there to invent, to innovate,\n\n40:20.280 --> 40:25.280\n that's so purely human, that human spirit\n\n40:25.720 --> 40:28.160\n to sort of build something new.\n\n40:28.160 --> 40:30.200\n It's like that hopeful, optimistic spirit,\n\n40:30.200 --> 40:32.080\n especially in the engineering space.\n\n40:32.080 --> 40:33.640\n Like if you pay attention to the internet,\n\n40:33.640 --> 40:36.240\n like Twitter and all that kind of stuff,\n\n40:36.240 --> 40:39.480\n intellectuals and so on, there's a cynicism\n\n40:39.480 --> 40:43.320\n to when we talk about stuff,\n\n40:43.320 --> 40:46.900\n but there's an optimism to when we do stuff.\n\n40:46.900 --> 40:49.880\n And the doing part, when you actually build things,\n\n40:49.880 --> 40:52.880\n especially, like you care a lot about manufacturing too,\n\n40:52.880 --> 40:55.840\n like you actually build physical products,\n\n40:55.840 --> 40:59.280\n that's where we truly shine.\n\n40:59.280 --> 41:01.040\n Yeah, no question about it.\n\n41:01.040 --> 41:06.040\n And I'm passionate about our country making stuff again,\n\n41:06.040 --> 41:11.040\n doing our own manufacturing and making sure\n\n41:11.960 --> 41:14.020\n that we don't lose the ability,\n\n41:14.020 --> 41:17.960\n not just to create things intellectually\n\n41:17.960 --> 41:19.520\n and do the world's greatest blueprints,\n\n41:19.520 --> 41:22.080\n but actually make things here.\n\n41:22.080 --> 41:23.080\n Actual factories.\n\n41:23.080 --> 41:24.280\n Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n41:24.280 --> 41:26.120\n How do we do that?\n\n41:26.120 --> 41:30.640\n How do we bring more manufacturing to the United States?\n\n41:30.640 --> 41:34.880\n Well, there's a company that I have a big personal investment\n\n41:34.880 --> 41:39.440\n in called Rebuild with some folks\n\n41:39.440 --> 41:44.440\n that all went through the MIT school years ago.\n\n41:45.120 --> 41:47.160\n There's a good friend of mine named Jeff Wilkie\n\n41:47.160 --> 41:49.720\n who used to be at Amazon.\n\n41:49.720 --> 41:54.280\n And we all felt the same way that America needed\n\n41:54.280 --> 41:56.600\n to make sure that it didn't lose its edge in that way.\n\n41:56.600 --> 42:00.280\n So it's a company that invests\n\n42:00.280 --> 42:03.380\n in American high tech manufacturing.\n\n42:03.380 --> 42:07.500\n And I think the way that we do that is provide capital,\n\n42:07.500 --> 42:09.620\n provide training.\n\n42:09.620 --> 42:12.300\n To me, this is also fertile ground for good,\n\n42:12.300 --> 42:14.320\n sustainable, high paying jobs.\n\n42:16.340 --> 42:21.340\n And we have to make it economically feasible to do that,\n\n42:21.980 --> 42:24.100\n again, here in this country.\n\n42:24.100 --> 42:26.500\n And not to say to companies that, again,\n\n42:26.500 --> 42:28.820\n are being weighed and measured quarter by quarter.\n\n42:28.820 --> 42:31.480\n Hey, this is three times as expensive to do it here,\n\n42:31.480 --> 42:33.140\n but you should do it here.\n\n42:33.140 --> 42:36.940\n We need to innovate and we need to create processes\n\n42:36.940 --> 42:41.940\n and companies and opportunity that balance that equation.\n\n42:42.100 --> 42:44.440\n And I think as we saw during the pandemic,\n\n42:45.860 --> 42:48.700\n I don't think in this day and age you can be an isolationist.\n\n42:48.700 --> 42:51.460\n That doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n42:51.460 --> 42:54.860\n But being self reliant and self determinant\n\n42:54.860 --> 42:59.860\n and making sure that you are never in a position as a nation\n\n43:00.420 --> 43:01.860\n that we can't do basic things\n\n43:01.860 --> 43:05.320\n because we're relying on supply chain in other countries.\n\n43:05.320 --> 43:09.360\n And whether it's we're not friends anymore,\n\n43:09.360 --> 43:13.940\n or a natural disaster or a virus or something pops up,\n\n43:13.940 --> 43:17.180\n I think those are costs of doing business\n\n43:17.180 --> 43:20.020\n that we have to put into the calculus\n\n43:20.020 --> 43:22.860\n of being able to make things here.\n\n43:22.860 --> 43:25.520\n There's an extremely high cost to making supply chain\n\n43:25.520 --> 43:27.860\n resilient that we really have to consider.\n\n43:27.860 --> 43:31.500\n And so if you really consider that cost,\n\n43:31.500 --> 43:34.140\n it makes a lot of sense to invest especially long term\n\n43:34.140 --> 43:37.020\n in building up manufacturing in a way\n\n43:37.020 --> 43:40.380\n where like you're making most of the stuff in one place.\n\n43:40.380 --> 43:44.940\n Sort of bringing it all, not all,\n\n43:44.940 --> 43:47.000\n but as much in as possible.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.860\n And building it almost like from scratch\n\n43:49.860 --> 43:50.840\n here in the United States.\n\n43:50.840 --> 43:55.840\n I mean, what I guess your thought is with innovation,\n\n43:57.500 --> 43:59.660\n it's possible to sort of revolutionize\n\n43:59.660 --> 44:00.900\n the way we do manufacturing.\n\n44:00.900 --> 44:03.580\n So reduce the amount of supply chain stuff\n\n44:03.580 --> 44:05.260\n and like build stuff from scratch.\n\n44:05.260 --> 44:08.780\n Like do high tech manufacturing.\n\n44:08.780 --> 44:11.740\n So like optimize all aspects of the manufacturing\n\n44:11.740 --> 44:13.640\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n44:13.640 --> 44:18.640\n Yeah, and I think where technology is the most efficient\n\n44:19.940 --> 44:23.780\n is the human machine interface, right?\n\n44:23.780 --> 44:25.480\n It's not let's automate everything\n\n44:25.480 --> 44:27.140\n and have nobody work anywhere.\n\n44:27.140 --> 44:32.140\n I, for a long time, that's neither feasible nor desirable.\n\n44:32.380 --> 44:35.620\n But where we can enhance jobs\n\n44:37.380 --> 44:41.380\n and make that interface immensely productive\n\n44:42.340 --> 44:43.900\n with the right training and so forth,\n\n44:43.900 --> 44:46.260\n I think that's a worthwhile endeavor\n\n44:46.260 --> 44:49.180\n and something that's gonna be important to our country.\n\n44:49.180 --> 44:53.100\n Yeah, I mean, you know who you're talking to.\n\n44:53.100 --> 44:55.880\n I love human robot interaction, human machine interaction,\n\n44:55.880 --> 44:57.260\n human AI interaction.\n\n44:57.260 --> 44:59.100\n So what do you think is the role of robotics\n\n44:59.100 --> 45:02.100\n in this high tech manufacturing?\n\n45:02.100 --> 45:04.380\n Sort of like industrial robots, robotic arms,\n\n45:04.380 --> 45:06.380\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n45:06.380 --> 45:09.380\n Or even more complicated kind of robots.\n\n45:09.380 --> 45:11.640\n What do you think is the role of robotics?\n\n45:11.640 --> 45:13.220\n What do you think is the role of AI\n\n45:13.220 --> 45:16.220\n in this manufacturing future you're thinking about?\n\n45:16.220 --> 45:20.340\n Well, robotics to me is an extremely exciting field.\n\n45:20.340 --> 45:23.060\n I don't have the same expertise that you do.\n\n45:23.060 --> 45:26.000\n I have an adjacency, but not the depth of knowledge.\n\n45:27.260 --> 45:29.160\n Have never really delved deeply into it\n\n45:29.160 --> 45:30.380\n or made investments in it.\n\n45:30.380 --> 45:32.500\n But I think what's exciting about it\n\n45:32.500 --> 45:34.980\n is everything from doing jobs\n\n45:34.980 --> 45:37.420\n that are very dangerous for humans,\n\n45:38.700 --> 45:41.540\n enhancing the human experience.\n\n45:41.540 --> 45:44.900\n When you look at really repetitive labor,\n\n45:44.900 --> 45:49.060\n things that, you know, it might take away a job,\n\n45:49.060 --> 45:51.540\n but is it a good job for that person?\n\n45:51.540 --> 45:53.300\n Is, you know, spending 30 years\n\n45:53.300 --> 45:55.140\n doing something highly repetitious,\n\n45:55.140 --> 45:58.980\n is that a good experience in life?\n\n45:58.980 --> 46:02.500\n So I think, and then when you think about everything\n\n46:02.500 --> 46:06.940\n from military applications, you know, rescue,\n\n46:06.940 --> 46:08.980\n we're already seeing a bunch of those things.\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:11.640\n And then just lastly,\n\n46:11.640 --> 46:15.140\n when you talk about that human interaction with robots,\n\n46:15.140 --> 46:17.940\n when you start to have the combination,\n\n46:17.940 --> 46:22.220\n so you have some level of intelligence and interaction,\n\n46:22.220 --> 46:25.740\n I mean, that's why we always love the droids\n\n46:25.740 --> 46:26.780\n in Star Wars, right?\n\n46:26.780 --> 46:31.780\n I mean, it's exciting, it captures the imagination.\n\n46:33.780 --> 46:38.780\n And I think, look, many, many hours have been spent\n\n46:39.500 --> 46:42.740\n on debating artificial intelligence\n\n46:42.740 --> 46:47.740\n and the ramifications, if things go sideways and so forth.\n\n46:48.100 --> 46:50.580\n And I think those are all, you know,\n\n46:50.580 --> 46:54.180\n those are appropriate conversations to be having.\n\n46:54.180 --> 46:55.980\n AI is happening.\n\n46:55.980 --> 46:57.960\n I think it's actually happening slower\n\n46:57.960 --> 46:59.500\n than most people realize,\n\n47:01.580 --> 47:04.580\n because there are tasks that humans do\n\n47:04.580 --> 47:06.700\n every minute of every day,\n\n47:06.700 --> 47:09.620\n standing up without losing your sense of balance.\n\n47:09.620 --> 47:12.820\n I mean, these are really hard things,\n\n47:12.820 --> 47:16.660\n but I think there's enough investment,\n\n47:16.660 --> 47:19.820\n both in private industry as well as nation states now\n\n47:19.820 --> 47:22.660\n on artificial intelligence that it is coming.\n\n47:23.880 --> 47:27.340\n So both in the software space, in the digital space\n\n47:27.340 --> 47:29.100\n and in the physical space.\n\n47:29.100 --> 47:30.620\n So we talk about manufacturing,\n\n47:30.620 --> 47:33.820\n so industrial robotics is very true\n\n47:33.820 --> 47:36.380\n that even in the factory, even the tasks that you think\n\n47:36.380 --> 47:40.980\n are pretty basic, you know,\n\n47:40.980 --> 47:45.100\n the amount of small intuitive decisions that humans make\n\n47:45.100 --> 47:46.540\n is quite incredible.\n\n47:46.540 --> 47:49.740\n So we have to be kind of explicit about saying\n\n47:49.740 --> 47:52.140\n which tasks are actually really hard\n\n47:52.140 --> 47:54.660\n and humans are just really good at them.\n\n47:54.660 --> 47:59.260\n And so on the flip side in the digital space\n\n47:59.260 --> 48:01.620\n with social networks, we recommend our systems\n\n48:01.620 --> 48:04.740\n with all kinds of like personal assistance\n\n48:04.740 --> 48:09.740\n in terms of voice based AI systems, all of that.\n\n48:10.340 --> 48:13.140\n There's opportunities there to find niches\n\n48:13.140 --> 48:17.260\n where AI can really have a transformative effect.\n\n48:17.260 --> 48:22.180\n I think one of the places that really haven't,\n\n48:25.080 --> 48:27.420\n this is where like you're worried to say stupid things,\n\n48:27.420 --> 48:32.260\n but I believe this very much that when we have AI systems\n\n48:32.260 --> 48:34.620\n in the home currently, you have somebody like Alexa\n\n48:34.620 --> 48:36.500\n and Google Home and so on,\n\n48:36.500 --> 48:40.820\n they're kind of very basic servants.\n\n48:40.820 --> 48:43.220\n They tell you about the weather, they can play some music,\n\n48:43.220 --> 48:45.060\n they can turn the lights on and off,\n\n48:45.060 --> 48:47.620\n all the kind of like smart home stuff.\n\n48:47.620 --> 48:51.380\n I think there's a lot of value in systems\n\n48:51.380 --> 48:55.060\n that form relationships with us\n\n48:55.060 --> 48:58.980\n in the way that pets do, dogs and cats.\n\n48:58.980 --> 49:01.340\n I don't know, just for people who have cats,\n\n49:01.340 --> 49:02.500\n cats don't care about you.\n\n49:02.500 --> 49:05.140\n They really don't, they don't form any kind of relationship.\n\n49:05.140 --> 49:07.060\n I don't know why you have relationship with them.\n\n49:07.060 --> 49:08.260\n It's one way.\n\n49:08.260 --> 49:11.940\n Anyway, sorry, I threw out some shade.\n\n49:11.940 --> 49:13.200\n I'm just kidding by the way.\n\n49:13.200 --> 49:14.940\n That's a basic kind of connection you have\n\n49:14.940 --> 49:16.940\n with another living being.\n\n49:16.940 --> 49:18.440\n Then there's also just friends.\n\n49:18.440 --> 49:20.060\n You have different levels of friends,\n\n49:20.060 --> 49:22.580\n acquaintances, you have lifelong friends, all that.\n\n49:22.580 --> 49:26.460\n That friendship you have, I really believe\n\n49:26.460 --> 49:29.740\n that there is some aspect of the human experience\n\n49:29.740 --> 49:34.740\n that is deeply enriched by interacting with other beings.\n\n49:35.420 --> 49:40.300\n And for systems, computing systems,\n\n49:40.300 --> 49:43.060\n artificial intelligence systems in our world,\n\n49:44.220 --> 49:46.940\n to have the capability to engage in some of that,\n\n49:46.940 --> 49:49.020\n I think is not just an opportunity\n\n49:49.020 --> 49:53.580\n to help people grow, become better people,\n\n49:53.580 --> 49:56.100\n but it's also just a good business opportunity too.\n\n49:56.100 --> 49:58.540\n And that hasn't really been explored enough.\n\n49:58.540 --> 50:02.260\n So that to me is really, that's a whole exciting space\n\n50:02.260 --> 50:07.260\n that I think will enable better industrial robotics.\n\n50:08.660 --> 50:11.460\n It will empower a better Facebook\n\n50:11.460 --> 50:14.300\n or a better social network, a competitor to Facebook\n\n50:14.300 --> 50:15.740\n that overthrows Facebook.\n\n50:15.740 --> 50:19.660\n So it'll create better technologies\n\n50:19.660 --> 50:24.340\n that currently don't have that human robot interaction touch.\n\n50:24.340 --> 50:27.740\n So I don't know, that's super exciting to me,\n\n50:27.740 --> 50:32.740\n but that has to deal with the mess of human nature.\n\n50:34.420 --> 50:36.980\n The reason that most robotics people\n\n50:36.980 --> 50:39.280\n and AI people stay away from humans,\n\n50:40.820 --> 50:43.900\n they stay away from the human robot interaction problem,\n\n50:43.900 --> 50:46.300\n is because humans are complicated.\n\n50:46.300 --> 50:49.180\n They're messy, they're hard to control,\n\n50:49.180 --> 50:54.180\n they're hard to predict stuff about,\n\n50:54.180 --> 50:58.680\n they're hard to make sense of or like test repeatedly\n\n50:58.680 --> 51:01.840\n because one human can be drastically different\n\n51:01.840 --> 51:02.960\n from another human.\n\n51:02.960 --> 51:05.200\n And so to deal with that as a robotics problem\n\n51:05.200 --> 51:06.120\n is super hard.\n\n51:07.240 --> 51:11.760\n And so one of the questions is which problems\n\n51:11.760 --> 51:14.080\n can you remove the human from consideration\n\n51:14.080 --> 51:15.580\n when you're trying to solve the problem?\n\n51:15.580 --> 51:17.720\n So like Elon Musk is an example of somebody\n\n51:17.720 --> 51:20.540\n who believes autonomous driving,\n\n51:20.540 --> 51:23.160\n we can remove the human from consideration,\n\n51:23.160 --> 51:26.440\n we can solve autonomous driving as a robotics problem.\n\n51:26.440 --> 51:28.360\n It's stay in the lane.\n\n51:28.360 --> 51:31.520\n When there's a red light, you stop at a red light.\n\n51:31.520 --> 51:34.560\n If there is humans in the picture like pedestrians,\n\n51:34.560 --> 51:36.520\n that's a ballistics problem.\n\n51:36.520 --> 51:39.540\n It's just treat them as a moving object\n\n51:39.540 --> 51:42.640\n that has with like 90% probability\n\n51:42.640 --> 51:45.840\n keeps moving in the way they were in the past few seconds\n\n51:45.840 --> 51:49.280\n with some smaller probability that might stop or turn.\n\n51:49.280 --> 51:51.480\n Just do some basic models about them\n\n51:51.480 --> 51:53.280\n and you'll be able to do just fine.\n\n51:53.280 --> 51:57.140\n So I tend to believe that even driving\n\n51:58.040 --> 52:01.060\n has to consider the full messiness of humans.\n\n52:01.060 --> 52:03.880\n The dance, the game theoretic dance of chicken\n\n52:03.880 --> 52:07.440\n that we all do when we jaywalk,\n\n52:07.440 --> 52:10.100\n we look at the car, that car doesn't,\n\n52:10.100 --> 52:12.100\n that driver doesn't have the guts to murder me\n\n52:12.100 --> 52:14.560\n so I'm going to walk in front of it and not look at the car.\n\n52:14.560 --> 52:17.520\n We do that kind of dance and AI systems\n\n52:17.520 --> 52:22.100\n need to be able to play, do that kind of dance.\n\n52:24.160 --> 52:28.480\n In Tolko, there's the labs.\n\n52:28.480 --> 52:32.280\n So there's a data science component, there's an AI component.\n\n52:32.280 --> 52:35.800\n So how do they go into a company\n\n52:35.800 --> 52:38.120\n and help revolutionize that industry?\n\n52:38.120 --> 52:39.840\n Well, there's different examples.\n\n52:39.840 --> 52:44.840\n So one of our companies, Figs, makes healthcare workwear,\n\n52:44.840 --> 52:47.440\n started by these two brilliant women\n\n52:47.440 --> 52:52.440\n and early days helping to build the platform and recruit\n\n52:54.240 --> 52:59.240\n and make sure that everything that we did\n\n52:59.680 --> 53:03.200\n at the company embraced technology\n\n53:03.200 --> 53:05.880\n and at the same time, they were obsessive\n\n53:05.880 --> 53:09.760\n about their customer, which is doctors, nurses,\n\n53:09.760 --> 53:12.440\n healthcare workers who are putting it on the line every day\n\n53:12.440 --> 53:13.960\n and obsessive about their product.\n\n53:13.960 --> 53:17.200\n And when you have those two things come together,\n\n53:17.200 --> 53:22.200\n you get the result that we did at Figs.\n\n53:24.560 --> 53:26.640\n We have a company called Acashure,\n\n53:26.640 --> 53:31.440\n which it's AI lab and base is down here in Austin, Texas.\n\n53:31.440 --> 53:33.600\n It was an insurance,\n\n53:33.600 --> 53:36.600\n one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.\n\n53:36.600 --> 53:40.840\n And we did a deal with them\n\n53:40.840 --> 53:44.360\n and sold some of our insurance holdings\n\n53:44.360 --> 53:46.480\n that was completely AI driven.\n\n53:47.760 --> 53:50.680\n And in that case, you basically put the team\n\n53:50.680 --> 53:52.680\n inside the company, right?\n\n53:52.680 --> 53:56.080\n Because it's a massive company\n\n53:56.080 --> 53:58.080\n and we've gone into all kinds of things.\n\n53:59.760 --> 54:03.760\n So it just depends on the different situations.\n\n54:03.760 --> 54:06.560\n But the biggest thing was just to make sure\n\n54:06.560 --> 54:08.120\n whatever the company needed,\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:11.880\n they had access to the talent.\n\n54:11.880 --> 54:15.440\n Sometimes we'd build it, sometimes we'd help recruit for it.\n\n54:15.440 --> 54:18.480\n You know how in technology, it's whatever works, right?\n\n54:18.480 --> 54:22.200\n There's no one way to do things.\n\n54:22.200 --> 54:25.760\n Well, Acashure is really interesting as an example.\n\n54:25.760 --> 54:27.560\n So insurance is a fascinating space.\n\n54:27.560 --> 54:30.320\n It seems like very ripe still\n\n54:30.320 --> 54:32.600\n for disruption across the board.\n\n54:32.600 --> 54:35.560\n So how do you, it seems like a lot of the disruption\n\n54:35.560 --> 54:40.560\n has to do with almost the first dump step\n\n54:42.040 --> 54:44.800\n of we've been using mostly paper.\n\n54:46.040 --> 54:47.840\n It's not digitized.\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:51.600\n You have to basically create a infrastructure\n\n54:51.600 --> 54:53.520\n and a framework where everybody is using\n\n54:53.520 --> 54:56.840\n the same digital system, like databases\n\n54:56.840 --> 54:59.000\n and just organize the data.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.280\n It seems like that's a huge leap\n\n55:01.280 --> 55:03.960\n that basically can revolutionize major industries\n\n55:03.960 --> 55:05.480\n that still hasn't been done.\n\n55:05.480 --> 55:08.000\n Insurance is obviously the great example of that.\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.760\n And one of the things that struck me,\n\n55:10.760 --> 55:14.040\n the founder CEO of Acashure is a guy named Greg Williams.\n\n55:14.040 --> 55:16.160\n They're out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n55:16.160 --> 55:18.480\n And as we were looking at expanding our footprint\n\n55:18.480 --> 55:22.280\n in insurance, I met with a lot of insurance executives.\n\n55:22.280 --> 55:24.320\n And they would talk about technology,\n\n55:24.320 --> 55:28.840\n but Greg truly understood the power\n\n55:28.840 --> 55:32.040\n of what would happen across actuarial sciences,\n\n55:32.040 --> 55:37.040\n predictive analytics and using machine learning\n\n55:37.280 --> 55:39.560\n to really run every aspect of your business.\n\n55:39.560 --> 55:42.440\n And then automating a lot of the,\n\n55:42.440 --> 55:45.560\n just the back office tedious steps.\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:48.720\n And as you said, one of the things that was great for us,\n\n55:48.720 --> 55:53.720\n they already had a data collection system and department.\n\n55:54.600 --> 55:57.080\n So it was much easier to pivot.\n\n55:58.040 --> 56:01.000\n And I'm very excited about the future of that company.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:06.000\n It's, they're doing some pretty innovative,\n\n56:06.240 --> 56:07.440\n groundbreaking things.\n\n56:07.440 --> 56:11.040\n And those are the things that I like doing, right?\n\n56:11.040 --> 56:15.400\n Is that, yes, I wanna make money.\n\n56:15.400 --> 56:17.320\n Just, that's what that is.\n\n56:17.320 --> 56:19.000\n But at the same time,\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.600\n what did you do with your time on earth, right?\n\n56:21.600 --> 56:24.360\n Did you do anything to leave any kind of mark\n\n56:24.360 --> 56:27.680\n that you did anything interesting?\n\n56:27.680 --> 56:29.480\n I can only speak for myself.\n\n56:29.480 --> 56:33.400\n There are many more ways to measure one's life.\n\n56:33.400 --> 56:36.680\n And I can only speak about how I think about things.\n\n56:37.920 --> 56:41.320\n I grew up poor in upstate New York with a single mom\n\n56:41.320 --> 56:43.320\n and watched her work a couple of jobs\n\n56:43.320 --> 56:48.320\n and had to, from a young age, shovel snow and mow lawns\n\n56:49.680 --> 56:52.280\n and do all kinds of things to help her\n\n56:52.280 --> 56:55.320\n make sure the lights weren't turned off in our little place.\n\n56:55.320 --> 56:57.360\n And so that's just something\n\n56:57.360 --> 57:00.280\n that I've always been driven towards.\n\n57:00.280 --> 57:05.280\n And I just, I have really eclectic tastes and interests.\n\n57:07.120 --> 57:11.320\n And it's just been an interesting journey.\n\n57:11.320 --> 57:14.800\n So help be part of and help enable\n\n57:14.800 --> 57:19.800\n some cool new creations across the board,\n\n57:19.880 --> 57:24.880\n like film, music, AI, manufacturing,\n\n57:24.880 --> 57:29.880\n just insurance, all the specific industries\n\n57:31.160 --> 57:33.200\n that you disrupted, yeah.\n\n57:33.200 --> 57:38.200\n Small tangent, back to your childhood with your mom.\n\n57:39.240 --> 57:42.680\n Any memories kind of stand out,\n\n57:42.680 --> 57:46.040\n stick with you as something\n\n57:46.040 --> 57:49.160\n that helped define who you are as a man?\n\n57:49.160 --> 57:53.280\n Yeah, even though the university and college experience\n\n57:53.280 --> 57:55.960\n was not part of the family tree,\n\n57:58.160 --> 58:01.480\n and we had no connections, I didn't understand,\n\n58:01.480 --> 58:03.800\n I didn't know what a trust fund was or prep school,\n\n58:03.800 --> 58:05.560\n I didn't know what any of that was.\n\n58:07.040 --> 58:10.920\n But my mom from a young age would always say,\n\n58:10.920 --> 58:12.160\n you know, you're gonna go to college.\n\n58:12.160 --> 58:15.320\n There's no, you know, if you choose to,\n\n58:15.320 --> 58:17.000\n and I think from a young age,\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:21.080\n that was just an expectation that I had\n\n58:21.080 --> 58:23.240\n and that she instilled and the work ethic.\n\n58:23.240 --> 58:24.720\n I watched her.\n\n58:24.720 --> 58:28.920\n And then my grandmother was a janitor,\n\n58:28.920 --> 58:31.800\n a cleaning lady in a hospital for 50 years.\n\n58:31.800 --> 58:36.400\n And then I remember there were times of, you know,\n\n58:36.400 --> 58:39.480\n I'm probably 10 years old, it's freezing cold out.\n\n58:39.480 --> 58:42.840\n And if I don't go out and shovel six driveways,\n\n58:42.840 --> 58:45.040\n we don't have enough money to pay the bill.\n\n58:45.040 --> 58:48.400\n So I don't know, I'm not a psychologist,\n\n58:48.400 --> 58:52.840\n so I don't know how that manifests itself in my life today.\n\n58:52.840 --> 58:57.840\n But I think the grit to say,\n\n58:57.880 --> 59:01.560\n I'm not in the mood to do this, I don't wanna do this,\n\n59:01.560 --> 59:04.400\n but that's the work that needs to be done.\n\n59:04.400 --> 59:08.400\n And no excuses, not I'm a victim\n\n59:08.400 --> 59:10.240\n and I'm gonna sit around and talk about,\n\n59:10.240 --> 59:12.200\n no, it is what it is,\n\n59:12.200 --> 59:15.000\n and you have to get done what you need to get done.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.120\n And again, I think it's,\n\n59:19.200 --> 59:22.400\n you can never fully put yourself in someone else's shoes\n\n59:22.400 --> 59:25.440\n or experience, so I don't know what that is or feels like.\n\n59:25.440 --> 59:28.600\n But for me, those were two, I think,\n\n59:28.600 --> 59:33.600\n formative things that were important in my childhood.\n\n59:33.800 --> 59:37.000\n So that's pretty, the reality of life like that\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:38.360\n is pretty humbling.\n\n59:38.360 --> 59:41.800\n You still, you've been so exceptionally successful\n\n59:41.800 --> 59:45.120\n that it's easy to get soft now.\n\n59:45.120 --> 59:48.320\n How do you get humbled these days?\n\n59:49.240 --> 59:50.560\n By getting up.\n\n59:50.560 --> 59:55.360\n You know, I think for me personally,\n\n59:55.360 --> 59:57.360\n trying to push the envelope\n\n59:57.360 --> 59:59.240\n and being weighed and measured, right?\n\n59:59.240 --> 1:00:00.680\n That's why I always loved sports too.\n\n1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:02.280\n There's a scoreboard.\n\n1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:07.280\n And I'm a huge believer in opportunity, meritocracy,\n\n1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:11.520\n all those things that I think are ideals\n\n1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:14.680\n that we wanna aspire to.\n\n1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:18.240\n And I think that there's a lot of things\n\n1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:21.400\n I'm involved with right now that I just wanna see\n\n1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:22.240\n if I can do it.\n\n1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:26.360\n I wanna see if, and you know,\n\n1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:29.640\n my own little mantra is cause the outcome, right?\n\n1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:32.480\n As much as you can, and at the same time,\n\n1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:36.080\n have the humility and not to have the hubris or arrogance\n\n1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:38.920\n to say I'm always gonna cause the outcome.\n\n1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:41.720\n Because you'll get your ass kicked pretty quickly\n\n1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:43.040\n and humbled.\n\n1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:45.160\n The world and the universe is a big place\n\n1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:50.120\n with forces beyond, but I think,\n\n1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:56.160\n I also think a lot about being intellectually honest,\n\n1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:59.480\n which when I do university talks and so forth,\n\n1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:02.680\n I think that's a superpower.\n\n1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:06.560\n Because if you find yourself making decisions\n\n1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:10.040\n based on other people's expectations,\n\n1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:13.280\n based on places you don't wanna go,\n\n1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:18.280\n but you feel like momentum is taking you there,\n\n1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:22.160\n I think that's a big problem.\n\n1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.960\n And there are people that go to our top universities\n\n1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:30.600\n and can't wait to get out and start their own company\n\n1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:35.160\n and they want that pressure and they want to grind.\n\n1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:38.520\n And there are other people that are smart and talented,\n\n1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:41.080\n but just say, look, I don't wanna lay awake\n\n1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:42.400\n staring at the ceiling wondering\n\n1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:43.680\n how I'm gonna make payroll.\n\n1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:45.480\n I don't want that in my life.\n\n1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:48.600\n And I think if you can square that up\n\n1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:51.240\n and be okay with it and say, what makes me tick?\n\n1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:52.800\n What makes me happy?\n\n1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:54.680\n What puts me in a bad head space?\n\n1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:57.920\n Because there's a difference between challenging yourself\n\n1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:00.080\n and going against your nature.\n\n1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:03.000\n So that's why I think that being intellectually honest\n\n1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.320\n and being able to really sit down\n\n1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:08.000\n and go inside your own head and say,\n\n1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:08.840\n what am I good at?\n\n1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:10.480\n What am I not good at?\n\n1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:12.320\n How am I gonna put myself in a position\n\n1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:13.760\n to be successful?\n\n1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:17.440\n Because I'm working on my weaknesses,\n\n1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:21.840\n but I'm not gonna put myself career wise in a position\n\n1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:24.840\n where I'm just fundamentally gonna have a hard time\n\n1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:25.840\n being successful.\n\n1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:30.120\n Yeah, intellectually honest is a tricky one.\n\n1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:34.320\n And it gets, there's like levels to it too.\n\n1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:35.840\n Sure.\n\n1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:40.280\n Because some of the things I think about\n\n1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:45.280\n when you dream of doing certain kinds of big things,\n\n1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:53.560\n a part of intellectual honesty is to say several things.\n\n1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:58.320\n One is like, hey, the thing you're dreaming about,\n\n1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:02.960\n like one, the fact that nobody's done it\n\n1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:07.960\n probably shows that you're just a dreamer.\n\n1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:12.960\n This is not going to, like think clearly.\n\n1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:14.280\n The fact that it hasn't been done\n\n1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:17.480\n probably shows that it may not be the right path.\n\n1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:21.680\n And two is like, if you're dreaming about stuff,\n\n1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.680\n there's a certain point where it's like,\n\n1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:25.840\n hey, you haven't done it.\n\n1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:27.760\n Like, why haven't you done it already then?\n\n1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:29.200\n Like you have to be honest with yourself.\n\n1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:30.480\n Like you have to be ambitious.\n\n1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:35.480\n Like a lot of people work hard a long time for a dream,\n\n1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:38.920\n but you have to wake up and be like, all right,\n\n1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:41.000\n I've been at this for 10 years.\n\n1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.240\n Like with a startup, you launch a startup\n\n1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:46.800\n and you think, okay, one year, two years,\n\n1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:49.080\n three years, four years, pretty successful,\n\n1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:50.840\n but it hasn't exploded like you dreamed\n\n1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:54.120\n and you have to shut it down.\n\n1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:56.000\n You have to be intellectually honest there.\n\n1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:59.200\n At the same time, you might want to be,\n\n1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:03.060\n like step it up, lean into it.\n\n1:04:03.060 --> 1:04:08.060\n Say almost like the flip side of like intellectual honesty\n\n1:04:10.140 --> 1:04:14.980\n is like maddening ambition of just saying, fuck it,\n\n1:04:14.980 --> 1:04:16.940\n I'm going to go all in.\n\n1:04:16.940 --> 1:04:19.820\n But that is a kind of intellectual honesty saying like,\n\n1:04:19.820 --> 1:04:23.140\n you know, the big problem here is I've been kind of going,\n\n1:04:23.140 --> 1:04:24.400\n doing too many things.\n\n1:04:26.180 --> 1:04:29.940\n Maybe with this dream, you have to go all in on it.\n\n1:04:29.940 --> 1:04:30.780\n All those kinds of things.\n\n1:04:30.780 --> 1:04:33.280\n I mean, this is human experience, it's complicated.\n\n1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:37.580\n Yes, all human things are complicated.\n\n1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:41.700\n And I think there's a difference between being reckless\n\n1:04:41.700 --> 1:04:44.980\n and making well thought out informed decisions.\n\n1:04:44.980 --> 1:04:46.340\n If you're going to go all in,\n\n1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:50.900\n make sure you've measured twice, cut once, as they say.\n\n1:04:50.900 --> 1:04:54.980\n And one of my other favorite, I forget,\n\n1:04:54.980 --> 1:04:57.460\n many years ago, I heard this saying and it stayed with me.\n\n1:04:57.460 --> 1:05:00.740\n It was never mistake, clear line of sight\n\n1:05:00.740 --> 1:05:03.820\n with distance and you know that.\n\n1:05:03.820 --> 1:05:08.820\n So I think that the key, whether you're starting a business\n\n1:05:10.020 --> 1:05:12.300\n or you're thinking about leaving the company you're at\n\n1:05:12.300 --> 1:05:15.320\n and starting a business or just leaving for another job,\n\n1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:19.180\n any of these things is as much as you can, right?\n\n1:05:19.180 --> 1:05:21.300\n And psychologists, I think would tell us,\n\n1:05:21.300 --> 1:05:24.300\n it's hard to be self aware completely, right?\n\n1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:27.540\n That's the rub that if we were all completely self aware\n\n1:05:27.540 --> 1:05:30.340\n of everything that we did and strengthen weaknesses,\n\n1:05:30.340 --> 1:05:32.340\n it'd be a different world.\n\n1:05:32.340 --> 1:05:35.480\n But I do think you can work on that\n\n1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:39.380\n and at least challenge yourself to think about it\n\n1:05:39.380 --> 1:05:43.940\n and not be in a position where I'm going to medical school\n\n1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:45.620\n because that's what you do in my family\n\n1:05:45.620 --> 1:05:48.440\n and even though I'm miserable doing it,\n\n1:05:50.100 --> 1:05:51.660\n things like that.\n\n1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:54.700\n So definitely you don't want to be sort of,\n\n1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:59.700\n because you don't think fall victim to conformity.\n\n1:05:59.700 --> 1:06:02.240\n Let's just go on doing the same thing over and over.\n\n1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:03.080\n That's right.\n\n1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:08.080\n But at the same time, is measure twice and cut once.\n\n1:06:11.520 --> 1:06:16.520\n It does feel like some of the biggest leaps taken\n\n1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:21.340\n are where you cut once and measure later.\n\n1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:24.200\n Is you leap in first.\n\n1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:25.040\n Sure.\n\n1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:28.360\n It's almost like a gut, I suppose that is a measurement,\n\n1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:32.320\n but you build up a good gut instinct of what to do\n\n1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:35.040\n and then you just do it and then you figure out,\n\n1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:37.920\n it's the building the airplane as you're flying it.\n\n1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:39.040\n Right.\n\n1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:42.880\n Well, and I think each one of those instances\n\n1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:44.040\n that you could probably cite\n\n1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:47.760\n has its own unique circumstances, right?\n\n1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:50.360\n I don't have a deep biotech background,\n\n1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:51.920\n so if I suddenly stood up and said,\n\n1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:55.080\n I'm gonna put everything I have into this idea,\n\n1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:59.840\n well, those are, it's game theory, right?\n\n1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:01.880\n What are the odds of success?\n\n1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:06.800\n If on the other hand, you're brilliant in your field\n\n1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:08.760\n or you've seen some opportunity\n\n1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:12.040\n that you think is wide open\n\n1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:16.120\n and you're gonna go for it and break stuff, that's great.\n\n1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:20.120\n You just wanna, to me, always say like,\n\n1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:23.700\n how crazy is this on the spectrum of,\n\n1:07:23.700 --> 1:07:25.840\n do I have any expertise?\n\n1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.280\n What is the downside if I fail, right?\n\n1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:34.980\n If you're at a certain point in life with young children\n\n1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:37.780\n and you've got a mortgage and whatever else,\n\n1:07:37.780 --> 1:07:41.320\n that is one circumstance versus I just got out of Stanford\n\n1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:44.800\n or I just got out of whatever and I'm gonna go for it.\n\n1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:47.540\n It's just the whole thing, right?\n\n1:07:47.540 --> 1:07:49.920\n It is complex as you point out.\n\n1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:52.820\n And sometimes you just wanna have the right matrix\n\n1:07:52.820 --> 1:07:55.480\n in your head of decision making process\n\n1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:57.680\n to try to arrive at the right place.\n\n1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:00.720\n And even if you get close, that's where I think you say,\n\n1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:03.560\n you know what, the hell with it, I'm doing this.\n\n1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:06.120\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:10.600\n I do wanna ask you about one specific idea\n\n1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.600\n that sounds super fascinating\n\n1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:13.880\n that you're involved with recently.\n\n1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:16.240\n You led the $50 million seed round\n\n1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:18.320\n for a company called Colossal\n\n1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:22.920\n that is focused on deextinction.\n\n1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:25.520\n This is funny relative to our connection\n\n1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.480\n and conversation about Jurassic World.\n\n1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:30.920\n They're seeking to restore lost ecosystems\n\n1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:34.640\n and use gene editing to restore the woolly mammoth\n\n1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:36.280\n to the Arctic tundra.\n\n1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:39.640\n How are they gonna do that?\n\n1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:43.360\n Well, I met this fascinating guy at Harvard\n\n1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:48.360\n named George Church five, six years ago,\n\n1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:53.440\n and found him to be incredibly smart, have an imagination.\n\n1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:59.820\n And he partnered up with a guy named Ben Lamb,\n\n1:08:59.820 --> 1:09:01.120\n who's an entrepreneur.\n\n1:09:02.540 --> 1:09:07.540\n And basically the press and to me the imaginative,\n\n1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:12.560\n like you're capturing my imagination by telling me\n\n1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:14.000\n you're gonna bring back the woolly mammoth\n\n1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.620\n and other extinct animals.\n\n1:09:15.620 --> 1:09:18.720\n And I, you know, we'll see where that road leads.\n\n1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.240\n I was more interested in an investor\n\n1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.480\n in the things that they're working through\n\n1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:30.080\n around understanding genes and proteins\n\n1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:31.840\n and CRISPR and all these other things\n\n1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:36.840\n because being adjacent to George Church and his team\n\n1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:39.040\n as these things unfold over the next decade,\n\n1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:42.840\n I thought was the right thing to do.\n\n1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:44.160\n So people are important here,\n\n1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.600\n just like investing people and seeing\n\n1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:48.120\n what the hell they come up with.\n\n1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:51.420\n Absolutely, I mean, you can look through history\n\n1:09:51.420 --> 1:09:56.420\n and great things are done by great people, right?\n\n1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:02.360\n And companies, they end up over time becoming a logo\n\n1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.820\n and immediately what you think of them,\n\n1:10:04.820 --> 1:10:08.360\n but they started out with a person, with an idea\n\n1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:12.340\n and a team that cultivated that and made that happen.\n\n1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:16.560\n And I think there are certain folks\n\n1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:18.240\n that are just immensely talented\n\n1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:21.840\n that if you can be around them,\n\n1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:25.940\n and I also know his and his team's ethics\n\n1:10:25.940 --> 1:10:28.680\n in terms of, you know, after spending time\n\n1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:31.380\n talking about where the lines are,\n\n1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:35.060\n people in other countries that, you know,\n\n1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:37.480\n may not have the same process,\n\n1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:39.760\n may not have the same checks and balances,\n\n1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:42.520\n are doing this and pursuing this regardless.\n\n1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.280\n So at least I felt like with George and Ben and their teams,\n\n1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:48.280\n they're also very responsible people.\n\n1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:53.560\n This is where the human side of things comes into play.\n\n1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:55.940\n I've interacted with a lot of really brilliant people\n\n1:10:55.940 --> 1:10:59.760\n in the technology space where you kind of,\n\n1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:01.540\n you know, there's a lot of ways to feel this out.\n\n1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:03.880\n You can ask them whether they kind of read literature.\n\n1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:08.000\n You can feel out how much do they really understand\n\n1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:12.240\n about like human nature here.\n\n1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:14.760\n Like whatever the technology is,\n\n1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:17.800\n when it actually starts to play,\n\n1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:21.120\n interact with society at scale,\n\n1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:23.600\n like do they have an understanding\n\n1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:26.380\n or an intuition about how that happens?\n\n1:11:26.380 --> 1:11:28.160\n Some of that requires studying history.\n\n1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:30.720\n Some of that requires like just looking at\n\n1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.320\n the worst and best parts and events in human history\n\n1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:38.800\n to understand like, hey, it doesn't always turn out\n\n1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.920\n like everybody hoped the technology turns out.\n\n1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:47.360\n If a person has a depth of understanding about history,\n\n1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:52.320\n about human nature, then I think that's the right person\n\n1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:56.520\n to mess with some of this cutting edge stuff.\n\n1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:01.440\n Now you want Marcus Aurelius with a PhD from MIT.\n\n1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:03.280\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:08.480\n Just small tangent, but you mentioned having a conversation\n\n1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:11.400\n with Warren Buffett, you spoke really highly of him\n\n1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:13.520\n as an investor, as a human being.\n\n1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:17.040\n What about him do you admire?\n\n1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:21.160\n What from him, what insights have you drawn from him\n\n1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:23.720\n as a great investor yourself?\n\n1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:26.220\n Well, the afternoon that I got to spend with him,\n\n1:12:26.220 --> 1:12:28.920\n which is something I'll treasure forever.\n\n1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:31.280\n Look, sometimes when you meet people,\n\n1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:33.360\n even that are immensely successful,\n\n1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:39.360\n you may decide that after 20 minutes or a half hour,\n\n1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:42.320\n oh, you were in the right place at the right time\n\n1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:45.740\n and that's fine.\n\n1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:49.080\n There are other people that are clearly different,\n\n1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:52.940\n special, and I don't care if you made them start from zero,\n\n1:12:52.940 --> 1:12:56.940\n you know, would end up in a good place.\n\n1:12:56.940 --> 1:12:59.560\n And so it was an absolute privilege\n\n1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:00.980\n to spend the time with him.\n\n1:13:03.420 --> 1:13:06.060\n You know, and a couple of things that stood out\n\n1:13:06.060 --> 1:13:11.060\n in the conversation, he is incredibly intellectually curious\n\n1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:15.800\n and well read, and I like how simplistic he likes\n\n1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:17.960\n to keep his thought matrix.\n\n1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:22.960\n And then also, instead of trying to outsmart the market,\n\n1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:26.680\n it seems like a simple axiom, but just look,\n\n1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:30.100\n good companies that are led by talented managers\n\n1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:35.100\n that are good businesses over time are gonna get there.\n\n1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:37.820\n So I'm not gonna day trade, I'm just gonna,\n\n1:13:37.820 --> 1:13:40.380\n I'm looking for value.\n\n1:13:40.380 --> 1:13:44.860\n And then just on life stuff, he just, you know,\n\n1:13:44.860 --> 1:13:49.000\n and also his ability to take in\n\n1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:54.000\n and then use information was incredibly impressive.\n\n1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:58.260\n So I only spent the, you know, I'd met him before,\n\n1:13:58.260 --> 1:14:00.180\n but I only spent one afternoon with him,\n\n1:14:00.180 --> 1:14:02.700\n but it's, you know, pretty incredible.\n\n1:14:02.700 --> 1:14:05.140\n And one of the things that stuck out to me\n\n1:14:05.140 --> 1:14:08.500\n is we were in the middle of talking about Tolko\n\n1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:10.800\n or investing or how we thought about it.\n\n1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:14.540\n And I said, you know, I'm trying to be smart about,\n\n1:14:14.540 --> 1:14:16.740\n and he stopped me and he said, Charlie Munger,\n\n1:14:16.740 --> 1:14:18.540\n his partner of many years, Charlie and I\n\n1:14:18.540 --> 1:14:21.000\n don't try to think of the smart thing to do.\n\n1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.640\n We try to think what's the dumb thing we could do here.\n\n1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:28.040\n And I kind of laughed and he said, no, I'm dead serious.\n\n1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:30.860\n We think about it from the standpoint of\n\n1:14:31.900 --> 1:14:34.180\n what could we do in this situation that later\n\n1:14:34.180 --> 1:14:37.480\n we'd be like, that was a really dumb thing to do.\n\n1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:41.420\n And I actually thought that was, it got in my head.\n\n1:14:41.420 --> 1:14:43.460\n And I still think a lot about that\n\n1:14:43.460 --> 1:14:45.680\n as I'm dissecting problems.\n\n1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:51.540\n So there is, like, that's a kind of longterm thinking\n\n1:14:51.540 --> 1:14:54.100\n if you just avoid the dumb things,\n\n1:14:54.100 --> 1:14:59.100\n or if you simplify, just focus on those simple steps,\n\n1:14:59.340 --> 1:15:02.740\n all it takes is just do that for a long period of time\n\n1:15:02.740 --> 1:15:04.500\n and you'll be successful.\n\n1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:07.580\n Well, it certainly worked for him, that's all I can say.\n\n1:15:07.580 --> 1:15:10.220\n What about you?\n\n1:15:10.220 --> 1:15:14.660\n You've been a great investor yourself.\n\n1:15:14.660 --> 1:15:18.240\n How do you know, when you judge people,\n\n1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:21.140\n so I, whenever I go to San Francisco,\n\n1:15:21.140 --> 1:15:22.900\n I was thinking of moving to San Francisco.\n\n1:15:22.900 --> 1:15:26.020\n That's why I decided to, after really giving it\n\n1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:29.020\n some thought, talking to people, decided to move to Austin.\n\n1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:33.660\n You know, everybody's dreaming big and they have big plans.\n\n1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:37.780\n And it's actually, I don't envy the job of an investor\n\n1:15:37.780 --> 1:15:42.180\n of any kind, because everybody has big dreams\n\n1:15:42.180 --> 1:15:45.140\n and it's hard to know who exactly,\n\n1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:48.380\n what idea is going to materialize,\n\n1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:51.700\n what team is going to materialize into something great.\n\n1:15:51.700 --> 1:15:55.140\n How do you make those decisions about people, about ideas?\n\n1:15:57.340 --> 1:16:01.900\n Well, if I had any kind of a lattice work on this,\n\n1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:04.860\n it absolutely starts with the people.\n\n1:16:04.860 --> 1:16:08.300\n And I think the reason for that is your business plan\n\n1:16:08.300 --> 1:16:10.340\n is going to change, right?\n\n1:16:10.340 --> 1:16:13.340\n There's very few businesses I know of that say,\n\n1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:16.020\n we're gonna make a widget in this location\n\n1:16:16.020 --> 1:16:18.460\n and 30 years later, we're successful\n\n1:16:18.460 --> 1:16:21.060\n and we just make a widget and that's what it is.\n\n1:16:21.060 --> 1:16:22.420\n Things happen, right?\n\n1:16:22.420 --> 1:16:24.980\n And today they happen with such velocity\n\n1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:30.980\n that you have to be able to make hard decisions\n\n1:16:31.340 --> 1:16:34.220\n based on imperfect information.\n\n1:16:34.220 --> 1:16:38.700\n And are you, how are you going to calculate those answers?\n\n1:16:38.700 --> 1:16:41.780\n How self interested are you going to be?\n\n1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:43.940\n What kind of ethics will you apply?\n\n1:16:44.900 --> 1:16:47.500\n What's your short term versus long term thinking?\n\n1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:52.140\n Are you able to give an honest assessment of a situation?\n\n1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:55.820\n Because the thing that you can count on\n\n1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:58.460\n is problems are gonna happen.\n\n1:16:58.460 --> 1:17:01.620\n Things you didn't anticipate are gonna happen.\n\n1:17:01.620 --> 1:17:04.020\n How pliable are you, right?\n\n1:17:04.020 --> 1:17:09.020\n How much elasticity is there in your ability\n\n1:17:09.060 --> 1:17:10.620\n to be successful?\n\n1:17:10.620 --> 1:17:15.220\n And I think it's important when you invest in something\n\n1:17:15.220 --> 1:17:20.020\n that you both see, you understand the roadmap ahead\n\n1:17:20.020 --> 1:17:21.740\n and agree to it, right?\n\n1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:23.460\n Doesn't mean there won't be twists and turns,\n\n1:17:23.460 --> 1:17:25.060\n but you're not like, whoa, wait a minute,\n\n1:17:25.060 --> 1:17:26.260\n what did we do here?\n\n1:17:26.260 --> 1:17:29.540\n This isn't what was in the thing I signed up for.\n\n1:17:29.540 --> 1:17:34.540\n And then I think honesty and communication\n\n1:17:34.940 --> 1:17:36.700\n is a huge thing to me with,\n\n1:17:38.260 --> 1:17:42.340\n I always tell people if bi directionally,\n\n1:17:42.340 --> 1:17:43.780\n if there's something going on,\n\n1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:48.380\n start the conversation with, Lex, we have a problem.\n\n1:17:48.380 --> 1:17:52.180\n Okay, now I'm sitting up, you have my full attention,\n\n1:17:52.180 --> 1:17:54.180\n we're gonna talk about whatever it is.\n\n1:17:54.180 --> 1:17:56.840\n Bad news should travel faster than good news.\n\n1:17:56.840 --> 1:18:01.320\n And because it's going to happen,\n\n1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:04.480\n being in business with someone\n\n1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:06.080\n that is gonna shoot you straight\n\n1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.880\n and sometimes say, I don't know.\n\n1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:10.920\n I don't know what the answer is.\n\n1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:12.520\n I gotta go figure it out.\n\n1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:15.880\n That I can process a lot better than,\n\n1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:18.440\n look, I don't want you mad at me or disappointed\n\n1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:20.920\n or I can't handle not having success.\n\n1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:23.040\n So we're just gonna kick the can.\n\n1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:26.960\n And I think, especially in today's business environment,\n\n1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:29.840\n that's very, very dangerous.\n\n1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:33.040\n So that's a bad sign, not just because it's good\n\n1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:35.760\n to communicate and be honest,\n\n1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:37.800\n but if they're not willing to do that,\n\n1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:40.280\n then it goes back to the intellectual honesty.\n\n1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:44.760\n They're probably not also able to be brutally honest\n\n1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:46.400\n with themselves when they look in the mirror\n\n1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:48.400\n about the direction of the company.\n\n1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:53.260\n But look, I wasn't there, so I don't know.\n\n1:18:53.260 --> 1:18:57.800\n But I think if you unpack many situations\n\n1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:00.040\n that turned out negatively,\n\n1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:03.720\n most of the people, whether you're faking lab results,\n\n1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:05.600\n you have a biotech company,\n\n1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:08.440\n everybody's staring at Theranos these days.\n\n1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:13.200\n Do I think in a lot of cases, you're either the villain,\n\n1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:14.880\n like you started out saying,\n\n1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:17.120\n I'm gonna screw my shareholders over\n\n1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:22.120\n and I'm gonna be a liar, that isn't my experience.\n\n1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:25.960\n Most things are little incremental moves that you say,\n\n1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:27.500\n we're gonna get this right next week,\n\n1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:29.160\n but today we gotta make the presentation.\n\n1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:31.680\n So we're gonna just tweak things a little bit.\n\n1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:34.160\n That's a slippery slope, right?\n\n1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:38.620\n And so that's why I think from a standpoint of people,\n\n1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:43.000\n you wanna go into the foxhole with folks that,\n\n1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:47.480\n you know, understand things are gonna happen\n\n1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:49.000\n and I'm gonna let you know about them\n\n1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.960\n and we're gonna try to solve them together.\n\n1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:55.320\n And then just in terms of the idea,\n\n1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:57.720\n it's, I always ask like, okay,\n\n1:19:57.720 --> 1:20:00.360\n if this company executed the way,\n\n1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:01.840\n that's the other thing that always cracks me up\n\n1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:05.000\n about financials, whenever somebody pitches you,\n\n1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:06.160\n inevitably they'll say,\n\n1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:09.920\n our projections are really, really conservative.\n\n1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:11.820\n I'm still waiting for somebody to come in and say,\n\n1:20:11.820 --> 1:20:14.440\n look, my projections are wildly optimistic.\n\n1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:17.200\n We'll never hit these numbers, but anyway,\n\n1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:22.600\n it's, you know, if this company did what it says\n\n1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:25.700\n and executes and does it matter, right?\n\n1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:27.240\n Does it move the needle enough?\n\n1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:31.400\n And what are the things that uniquely position\n\n1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:33.200\n this company to be successful?\n\n1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:35.080\n And you just have to be able to answer,\n\n1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:39.080\n I think a number of those questions pretty crisply.\n\n1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:41.640\n But at the end of the day, it's still a big risk.\n\n1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:44.500\n So you're just trying to minimize the risk.\n\n1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.200\n Let me jump to another topic.\n\n1:20:50.260 --> 1:20:53.000\n You're an incredible human being\n\n1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:54.320\n that you're involved with this.\n\n1:20:54.320 --> 1:20:59.320\n Your band, Ghost Hounds, is touring with the Rolling Stones.\n\n1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:03.400\n So before we talk about your band, let me ask about that.\n\n1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:07.100\n What's that like, playing with the Rolling Stones?\n\n1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:12.100\n Surreal, just because they're my favorite band of all time.\n\n1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:17.280\n To me, the greatest rock and roll band,\n\n1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:19.040\n it's not even close, of all time.\n\n1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:22.520\n And, you know, to share the same stage,\n\n1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:25.720\n to be on tour and to go out\n\n1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:30.400\n and get that energy from the crowd, you know,\n\n1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:32.360\n and every night and come off stage\n\n1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:34.700\n and later when they go on and you hear that iconic,\n\n1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:36.680\n ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones.\n\n1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:38.560\n And then it's incredible.\n\n1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:42.440\n And, you know, what's amazing to me about the band,\n\n1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:47.220\n next year will be their 60th anniversary, 60 years.\n\n1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:53.080\n And it's hard to be around anything for that long,\n\n1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:56.560\n but making music and packing stadiums.\n\n1:21:56.560 --> 1:21:59.720\n And what's amazing to me, they can play a two hour set\n\n1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:03.080\n and it's not just that, oh, that's a hit or you recognize it.\n\n1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:06.120\n It's like every song is an anthem, right?\n\n1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:10.840\n And so it's been amazing.\n\n1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:12.800\n We got to play with them in 2019.\n\n1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:15.720\n And when they ask us to do this again,\n\n1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:19.880\n it's just an absolute privilege.\n\n1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:21.640\n I asked you this offline,\n\n1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:24.800\n so I know you are a kind of rockstar,\n\n1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:27.640\n but just me, maybe I'm projecting,\n\n1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:31.880\n but do you get nervous, such a large audience\n\n1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:33.800\n with the Rolling Stones?\n\n1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:36.080\n It feels like there'll be a lot of pressure.\n\n1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:39.520\n Yeah, I mean, you definitely don't want to screw it up.\n\n1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:44.520\n I think our band is tight knit and all that stuff.\n\n1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:50.680\n And I think that the individual nervousness dissipates\n\n1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:54.400\n when you go out as a group and you're making music together\n\n1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:57.240\n and you sort of, okay, we're all in this\n\n1:22:57.240 --> 1:23:01.680\n and we're doing a thing, which is why even in sports,\n\n1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:04.760\n I always look at individual events like ice skating\n\n1:23:04.760 --> 1:23:09.040\n or anything where it's just you out there alone.\n\n1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:12.960\n And that's different than being with a team and nerve wracking.\n\n1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:16.880\n So I'm sure if it was me with an acoustic guitar\n\n1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:18.920\n just going out, it would feel different,\n\n1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:22.720\n but absolutely you get the right kind of butterflies,\n\n1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:23.600\n I would call it.\n\n1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:28.040\n And just the energy of playing music\n\n1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:33.040\n and having it be this relationship and look, I get it.\n\n1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:36.040\n I've been to a ton of concerts where I'm like,\n\n1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:38.640\n look, can we just get to the band please?\n\n1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.440\n But what's been great is just an amazing reception.\n\n1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:46.480\n And we have this guy named Trey Nation\n\n1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:49.960\n who's the lead singer who's just incredibly talented.\n\n1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:54.200\n I mean, he's just not only an amazing voice,\n\n1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:56.520\n but just has that charismatic thing.\n\n1:23:56.520 --> 1:23:57.920\n Yeah, he's great.\n\n1:23:57.920 --> 1:23:58.760\n It's fun.\n\n1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:02.800\n What's it feel like to play in front of a huge audience?\n\n1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:07.400\n What's, as a guitarist, are you lost in the music?\n\n1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:10.600\n Like you almost don't feel the audience.\n\n1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:12.320\n Does it add extra energy?\n\n1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:14.360\n Does it add extra anxiety?\n\n1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:17.320\n What does it feel like?\n\n1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:19.480\n You know, stadiums are interesting\n\n1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:22.380\n just because it's so big and cavernous.\n\n1:24:22.380 --> 1:24:24.600\n And because you want to protect your ears.\n\n1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:27.240\n So we use an in ear system\n\n1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:30.600\n so that you are a little disconnected from the crowd.\n\n1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:32.180\n Because if you're playing that loud\n\n1:24:32.180 --> 1:24:33.400\n and you're standing in front of your amps\n\n1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:36.440\n without ear protection, that's bad.\n\n1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:38.200\n How are you monitoring the sound?\n\n1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:40.520\n The in ear stuff, is that producing sound\n\n1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:41.920\n or is it strictly ear plugs?\n\n1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:43.160\n No, it's producing the sound.\n\n1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:47.520\n So it's like putting ear pods in and listening to a song\n\n1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:48.840\n and you're playing to it, right?\n\n1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:51.440\n It's just us playing, but it protects your ears.\n\n1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:58.000\n But the energy from the crowd,\n\n1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.640\n when they get going and get into it,\n\n1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:03.380\n which Knock On Wood so far has been amazing,\n\n1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:06.440\n there's nothing like it.\n\n1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:11.440\n I mean, it's just this bi directional thing that happens.\n\n1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:17.080\n And music and sports were kind of my first loves.\n\n1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:23.680\n And yeah, it's very difficult to describe,\n\n1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:28.680\n I think accurately, because it's like no other feeling.\n\n1:25:31.260 --> 1:25:35.500\n Musically, how is it different than playing in a garage\n\n1:25:35.500 --> 1:25:38.260\n with the band by yourself practicing?\n\n1:25:38.260 --> 1:25:42.500\n Like, do you feel like you're creating something different\n\n1:25:42.500 --> 1:25:47.500\n when you got the guitar and the amp\n\n1:25:47.860 --> 1:25:50.180\n and just the sound dissipating out\n\n1:25:50.180 --> 1:25:52.840\n and everybody's listening, is that?\n\n1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:55.660\n It's, listen, the first time we did it\n\n1:25:55.660 --> 1:25:57.140\n and there's nobody in the stadium,\n\n1:25:57.140 --> 1:25:59.220\n first time I ever played in the stadium.\n\n1:25:59.220 --> 1:26:03.300\n And I'm just like, I'm out there in front\n\n1:26:03.300 --> 1:26:05.340\n and just hitting different chords\n\n1:26:05.340 --> 1:26:06.440\n and playing different licks.\n\n1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:09.220\n And I'm like, it's like I won a contest\n\n1:26:09.220 --> 1:26:10.460\n and I get to do this.\n\n1:26:11.820 --> 1:26:15.040\n But what's different about it,\n\n1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:16.300\n and each venue is different.\n\n1:26:16.300 --> 1:26:21.300\n So if you, we went on the road with ZZ Top a few years ago,\n\n1:26:21.300 --> 1:26:22.580\n which was incredible.\n\n1:26:22.580 --> 1:26:24.400\n Love Billy Gibbons, he's a Texan.\n\n1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:28.100\n Incredible person and guitar player.\n\n1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:32.520\n But when you're playing in like five to 7,000 seats,\n\n1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:36.420\n it's really, I mean, it's, you're right there with them,\n\n1:26:36.420 --> 1:26:37.340\n with the crowd.\n\n1:26:37.340 --> 1:26:39.780\n And then when you play in an arena,\n\n1:26:40.900 --> 1:26:44.980\n we toured with Bob Seger on his last tour, which was cool.\n\n1:26:44.980 --> 1:26:47.100\n Played some shows with him.\n\n1:26:47.100 --> 1:26:50.220\n And again, the arena, like they're all kind of packed\n\n1:26:50.220 --> 1:26:51.820\n on top of you.\n\n1:26:51.820 --> 1:26:54.240\n And it's super loud, which was cool.\n\n1:26:55.460 --> 1:26:56.620\n Meaning the crowd is,\n\n1:26:56.620 --> 1:26:59.940\n stadiums is a completely different animal.\n\n1:26:59.940 --> 1:27:04.940\n And it's just a completely different experience.\n\n1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:08.380\n Do you enjoy it versus like a smaller room?\n\n1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:13.380\n What, as a guitarist, as a musician,\n\n1:27:13.380 --> 1:27:16.420\n what's your favorite like room to play of the size?\n\n1:27:16.420 --> 1:27:17.860\n Any room that'll have me.\n\n1:27:17.860 --> 1:27:22.860\n You know, look, I think arenas are the perfect blend.\n\n1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:26.560\n If I had to say, because it's loud and, you know,\n\n1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:31.120\n 20, 30,000 people, but like right up, right up on you.\n\n1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:36.120\n A stadium, look, playing the stadiums with the Rolling\n\n1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:40.120\n Stones, it just is gonna go on the head marker somewhere\n\n1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:42.680\n is one of the more, you know, I say this,\n\n1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:43.680\n and I really mean it.\n\n1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:47.160\n My life is like a punked episode that just hasn't,\n\n1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:51.560\n no one's burst in yet, but yeah,\n\n1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:53.300\n it's as cool as you think it is.\n\n1:27:53.300 --> 1:27:56.340\n So 60 years, how do you think Mick Jagger still got it?\n\n1:27:58.560 --> 1:27:59.560\n How do you explain it?\n\n1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:00.520\n I gotta tell you something.\n\n1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:04.760\n I mean, the funny thing is whatever,\n\n1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:06.440\n wherever there is excellence,\n\n1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:09.680\n people wanna know how'd you do it, right?\n\n1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:10.900\n What's the secret?\n\n1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:15.200\n Not only is Mick Jagger, and I think the songs\n\n1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:17.960\n that Keith Richards and Mick Jagger wrote together,\n\n1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:19.960\n if you go back and listen to the lyrics,\n\n1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:23.920\n it's just incredibly poignant,\n\n1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.360\n and I'm just a huge Stones fan, so,\n\n1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:32.360\n but he works out like a maniac, right?\n\n1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:35.540\n And it's that 10,000 hours thing,\n\n1:28:35.540 --> 1:28:38.560\n and it's that, hey, maybe I don't feel my best today,\n\n1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:41.920\n but I'm gonna get up and do my routine and work out\n\n1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:46.920\n so that at his age, which, I mean,\n\n1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:51.000\n you can look at people at different ages chronologically\n\n1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:54.320\n that are, maybe we're both at this age,\n\n1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:57.820\n but I'm a lot older than you are, and vice versa.\n\n1:28:57.820 --> 1:29:02.820\n And he just, I think it's the combination of raw talent\n\n1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:06.040\n and the ability, and he's very smart, right?\n\n1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:10.480\n Like he understands how to have interaction with a crowd\n\n1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:11.960\n and hold them in the palm of his hand\n\n1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:15.120\n and be an entertainer, but then on top of that,\n\n1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:19.080\n the reason he can at this age run around stadiums\n\n1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:22.680\n and be just as energetic is he puts the work in.\n\n1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:24.640\n And that's one thing, step that I think\n\n1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:26.580\n a lot of people miss sometimes,\n\n1:29:26.580 --> 1:29:28.000\n where they want that magic trick,\n\n1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.280\n they wanna know what's the shortcut.\n\n1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.800\n Most of the time, the answer is there's no shortcut.\n\n1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:36.200\n Yeah, you have to work hard on the way there\n\n1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:38.060\n and work hard to stay on top.\n\n1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:40.040\n That's it.\n\n1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:41.840\n And sometimes it's not even like work hard,\n\n1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:45.200\n it's just like be a professional,\n\n1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:49.000\n which that involves, in his case, at his age,\n\n1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.720\n with the amount of stuff you have to do on stage\n\n1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:53.080\n and the way he does it.\n\n1:29:53.080 --> 1:29:53.920\n For two hours.\n\n1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:58.240\n You have, this is a professional athlete.\n\n1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:01.560\n A professional athlete that has to do things\n\n1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:04.240\n that are probably designed for 20 year olds\n\n1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:06.880\n and 30 year olds has to do it at an older age,\n\n1:30:06.880 --> 1:30:08.720\n which means what do you have to do?\n\n1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:11.320\n Well, he probably has a whole physical routine\n\n1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:12.440\n he has to do.\n\n1:30:12.440 --> 1:30:13.800\n Diet, the whole thing.\n\n1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:17.200\n And it's hard, look, if you wanna do great things,\n\n1:30:17.200 --> 1:30:19.980\n you probably have to do hard things to get there.\n\n1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:22.960\n I'm not gonna make you pick,\n\n1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:25.680\n just stick on the stones for one more minute.\n\n1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:31.720\n But what are some great Rolling Stones songs\n\n1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:36.040\n that were impactful to you, lyrically, musically,\n\n1:30:36.040 --> 1:30:41.040\n maybe something you like playing, like air guitar.\n\n1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:42.320\n Oh, sure.\n\n1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:43.840\n I don't know.\n\n1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:47.080\n Probably my favorites, I love Sympathy for the Devil.\n\n1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:47.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:51.000\n It's a very, I don't know, sort of Faustian.\n\n1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:52.360\n I love the lyrics.\n\n1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:55.080\n I love how the, almost a voodoo beat\n\n1:30:55.080 --> 1:30:57.300\n just kind of builds throughout the song.\n\n1:30:58.460 --> 1:31:00.320\n That's always been one of my favorites.\n\n1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:02.980\n So in that song, he never mentions Devil, does he?\n\n1:31:02.980 --> 1:31:04.020\n No, wait, sorry.\n\n1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:07.580\n Like, you know my name.\n\n1:31:07.580 --> 1:31:08.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:11.180\n There's like a flirtation going on in the lyrics.\n\n1:31:11.180 --> 1:31:12.020\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n1:31:12.020 --> 1:31:15.180\n Yeah, here's all the trouble I've caused along the way\n\n1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:16.940\n with you humans.\n\n1:31:16.940 --> 1:31:18.820\n And I just think it's really, really great.\n\n1:31:18.820 --> 1:31:20.700\n And musically, it builds really nicely.\n\n1:31:20.700 --> 1:31:21.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:21.540 --> 1:31:23.420\n And it's like both fun and dark.\n\n1:31:23.420 --> 1:31:24.600\n It's cool.\n\n1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:25.440\n It's a,\n\n1:31:29.180 --> 1:31:30.980\n there's a playful nature to it.\n\n1:31:30.980 --> 1:31:33.660\n It's, that's very stones.\n\n1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:34.900\n The only, they can pull it off\n\n1:31:34.900 --> 1:31:36.300\n because it's like playful,\n\n1:31:36.300 --> 1:31:39.860\n but it's also like dark and dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.\n\n1:31:39.860 --> 1:31:40.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:40.700 --> 1:31:44.300\n And Gimme Shelter is just, you know,\n\n1:31:44.300 --> 1:31:48.380\n and to this day, when I listen to the studio version\n\n1:31:48.380 --> 1:31:53.380\n and Mary Clayton just comes on and sings that epic,\n\n1:31:53.380 --> 1:31:55.500\n iconic part.\n\n1:31:55.500 --> 1:31:58.820\n And there's a documentary that was done\n\n1:31:58.820 --> 1:32:02.560\n about backup singers, phenomenal.\n\n1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:06.820\n And it tells the story of that moment\n\n1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:08.220\n in that song with Mary Clayton.\n\n1:32:08.220 --> 1:32:13.220\n And it's just her voice and the way it unfolded,\n\n1:32:13.300 --> 1:32:15.740\n they got her out of bed at like 10 o clock at night in LA.\n\n1:32:15.740 --> 1:32:17.820\n And she's like the Rolling Stones,\n\n1:32:17.820 --> 1:32:20.540\n and went in and just killed it.\n\n1:32:20.540 --> 1:32:23.140\n And I can't sing at all.\n\n1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:26.780\n I'm by ordinance not allowed around a microphone.\n\n1:32:26.780 --> 1:32:31.780\n So I'm always in awe when someone can sing like that.\n\n1:32:32.980 --> 1:32:35.260\n But, you know, those are,\n\n1:32:35.260 --> 1:32:39.180\n those are some of my favorite Rolling Stones songs\n\n1:32:39.180 --> 1:32:41.480\n and Painted Black's awesome.\n\n1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:42.660\n I mean, I could go on and on.\n\n1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:44.020\n Yeah, Painted Black is great.\n\n1:32:44.020 --> 1:32:45.980\n Again, a song that builds as bad as,\n\n1:32:45.980 --> 1:32:48.340\n I mean, it defines a whole generation.\n\n1:32:48.340 --> 1:32:49.580\n What made you pick up a guitar?\n\n1:32:49.580 --> 1:32:52.580\n What made you fall in love with the guitar?\n\n1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:55.060\n It's just the coolest instrument, right?\n\n1:32:55.060 --> 1:32:57.640\n I mean, when you watched back then,\n\n1:32:59.220 --> 1:33:01.640\n and I was kind of an old soul.\n\n1:33:01.640 --> 1:33:06.640\n I was listening at a fairly young age to Muddy Waters,\n\n1:33:08.180 --> 1:33:11.860\n Robert Johnson, Lightning Hopkins, BB King,\n\n1:33:11.860 --> 1:33:14.860\n and just the soulfulness.\n\n1:33:14.860 --> 1:33:16.020\n Thrills gone.\n\n1:33:16.020 --> 1:33:21.020\n Oh my, I mean, BB plays five notes and just kills it\n\n1:33:21.820 --> 1:33:24.100\n and the emotion that it evokes.\n\n1:33:24.100 --> 1:33:29.100\n So I just was just in awe of the instrument.\n\n1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:34.380\n And I also, there's always somebody around who's a musician\n\n1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:39.340\n that just picks the instrument up and can play, right?\n\n1:33:39.340 --> 1:33:41.260\n And they're just so talented at it.\n\n1:33:41.260 --> 1:33:43.940\n And they can just listen to a record and play it.\n\n1:33:43.940 --> 1:33:45.780\n That was never me.\n\n1:33:45.780 --> 1:33:47.940\n I never took formal lessons.\n\n1:33:47.940 --> 1:33:52.020\n I had to grind to just make it sound\n\n1:33:52.020 --> 1:33:54.260\n like I wanted it to sound.\n\n1:33:54.260 --> 1:33:58.180\n So both technically and ear, everything was hard work.\n\n1:33:58.180 --> 1:34:02.980\n Yeah, I mean, I could hear it and what they call,\n\n1:34:02.980 --> 1:34:04.380\n you know, you play.\n\n1:34:04.380 --> 1:34:09.380\n So my right hand, the rhythm side of it is,\n\n1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:12.340\n that's probably if I have anything, my strength.\n\n1:34:13.180 --> 1:34:18.100\n But there's something pretty amazing that happens\n\n1:34:18.100 --> 1:34:22.500\n when you get together with other people and play a song\n\n1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:24.860\n in that moment where it hits the pocket\n\n1:34:25.940 --> 1:34:27.940\n and you all kind of know it.\n\n1:34:27.940 --> 1:34:31.140\n And it's just such a cool feeling.\n\n1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:34.940\n And it was interesting growing up because I was,\n\n1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:36.620\n again, I always had eclectic interests.\n\n1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:38.780\n So I loved math and physics and science.\n\n1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:41.100\n So I had those friends and I was an athlete\n\n1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:43.080\n and played football and baseball and basketball.\n\n1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:47.780\n So I had my jock friends, and then I had my music friends\n\n1:34:47.780 --> 1:34:51.620\n and so it was just kind of that.\n\n1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:55.760\n And so when I was still living in Los Angeles\n\n1:34:55.760 --> 1:35:00.760\n and had Legendary, I just missed playing.\n\n1:35:01.620 --> 1:35:04.540\n And so I put this band together\n\n1:35:04.540 --> 1:35:08.160\n and called it the Ghost Hounds because again,\n\n1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:13.060\n huge Robert Johnson fan and that legend of Robert Johnson\n\n1:35:13.060 --> 1:35:15.220\n selling his soul at the crossroads\n\n1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:17.100\n in exchange for his musical talent.\n\n1:35:17.100 --> 1:35:18.820\n And you guys have that in one of the videos.\n\n1:35:18.820 --> 1:35:19.660\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:35:19.660 --> 1:35:20.500\n Such a cool video.\n\n1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:25.500\n Exactly, so I just thought that's such cool lore.\n\n1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:28.340\n I just love the blues.\n\n1:35:28.340 --> 1:35:32.100\n So Robert Johnson would often talk about hellhounds\n\n1:35:32.100 --> 1:35:33.460\n on his trail.\n\n1:35:33.460 --> 1:35:37.580\n And so I always just thought, huh, what about ghost towns?\n\n1:35:37.580 --> 1:35:41.500\n So I wish it were a more clever, deeper story,\n\n1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:43.780\n but that's about it for the name.\n\n1:35:43.780 --> 1:35:45.780\n That's pretty deep, Robert Johnson's incredible.\n\n1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:48.340\n But you also talk about that you connect\n\n1:35:48.340 --> 1:35:50.860\n to the storytelling of blues.\n\n1:35:50.860 --> 1:35:53.740\n So what makes a good story in a song?\n\n1:35:53.740 --> 1:35:57.840\n Like what aspect of storytelling connects with you in song?\n\n1:35:57.840 --> 1:35:59.100\n So I'm a big lyrics guy too.\n\n1:35:59.100 --> 1:36:03.820\n I love like deep lyric people like Tom Waits\n\n1:36:03.820 --> 1:36:07.100\n and like people that are like Leonard Cohen,\n\n1:36:07.100 --> 1:36:12.100\n like even Bob Dylan, they're like obviously, it's poetry.\n\n1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:15.500\n And then there's some people like the Rolling Stones there.\n\n1:36:15.500 --> 1:36:18.220\n It's like seemingly simpler,\n\n1:36:18.220 --> 1:36:20.940\n but it's still so much more to it.\n\n1:36:20.940 --> 1:36:23.700\n It's like less is often more.\n\n1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:25.580\n It still tells a strong story.\n\n1:36:25.580 --> 1:36:27.740\n Yeah, and there's certain people\n\n1:36:27.740 --> 1:36:30.340\n and Jagger and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards\n\n1:36:30.340 --> 1:36:31.180\n are in this boat.\n\n1:36:31.180 --> 1:36:32.860\n Billy Gibbons is in this boat.\n\n1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:35.660\n They just say things in a certain way\n\n1:36:35.660 --> 1:36:37.220\n that are just cool, right?\n\n1:36:37.220 --> 1:36:42.220\n It's just, and so I write our music and lyrics.\n\n1:36:42.220 --> 1:36:44.980\n I have to tell a story.\n\n1:36:44.980 --> 1:36:46.700\n I have to know the characters in the song.\n\n1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:49.460\n I'm not good at just writing some rhymes\n\n1:36:49.460 --> 1:36:52.740\n and having it match up to the right key and the right music.\n\n1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:56.540\n I have to understand like, that's just me.\n\n1:36:56.540 --> 1:36:59.460\n And so I think that, look,\n\n1:36:59.460 --> 1:37:02.340\n if you have three or four minutes to tell a story,\n\n1:37:02.340 --> 1:37:07.340\n you have to be more efficient with your use of language.\n\n1:37:07.340 --> 1:37:10.460\n And you have to understand what you're building to it\n\n1:37:10.460 --> 1:37:12.820\n understand what you're building to, if anything,\n\n1:37:12.820 --> 1:37:15.420\n and evoke emotion.\n\n1:37:15.420 --> 1:37:18.580\n And hopefully for those three minutes,\n\n1:37:18.580 --> 1:37:21.620\n get the listener to understand\n\n1:37:21.620 --> 1:37:22.860\n not only the point of the song,\n\n1:37:22.860 --> 1:37:24.500\n but where you're coming from\n\n1:37:24.500 --> 1:37:28.260\n and to make you feel a certain way.\n\n1:37:28.260 --> 1:37:31.780\n There's a song that the audience has seemed to like a lot\n\n1:37:31.780 --> 1:37:34.340\n on the new album called Good Old Days.\n\n1:37:34.340 --> 1:37:38.380\n And I wrote that because especially during COVID\n\n1:37:38.380 --> 1:37:42.180\n and reflecting on what normalcy looks like\n\n1:37:42.180 --> 1:37:44.500\n and what happens when you're cut off,\n\n1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:49.100\n I just was kind of taken with this idea of\n\n1:37:50.100 --> 1:37:53.660\n that when you sit around and reminisce with friends,\n\n1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:58.660\n oftentimes it's not just like some big event happened.\n\n1:37:59.300 --> 1:38:00.900\n It's, remember that summer,\n\n1:38:00.900 --> 1:38:03.020\n we'd go up to the lake all the time\n\n1:38:03.020 --> 1:38:05.300\n and it's who you were with.\n\n1:38:05.300 --> 1:38:09.540\n And at the time, it probably seemed pretty pedestrian.\n\n1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:12.100\n It just seemed like kind of a normal day,\n\n1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:13.980\n but it was the company you were keeping.\n\n1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:15.740\n It was the time in your life.\n\n1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:17.860\n It was whatever it was.\n\n1:38:17.860 --> 1:38:21.460\n And I just kind of struck me that right now\n\n1:38:21.460 --> 1:38:24.180\n we're doing stuff that you're gonna reminisce about later\n\n1:38:24.180 --> 1:38:26.540\n that seems kind of ordinary to be like,\n\n1:38:26.540 --> 1:38:29.060\n man, that was such a great time.\n\n1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:31.540\n So the idea is be in the moment and all that stuff.\n\n1:38:31.540 --> 1:38:34.460\n But these are the good old days.\n\n1:38:34.460 --> 1:38:37.180\n And enjoy it and soak it in\n\n1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:39.420\n and kind of be present for it.\n\n1:38:39.420 --> 1:38:42.340\n Yeah, it's a great perspective to take on the present\n\n1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:44.340\n because we are in the thing that we'll remember.\n\n1:38:44.340 --> 1:38:46.180\n We're living through the thing we'll remember.\n\n1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:47.660\n And sometimes the things we'll remember\n\n1:38:47.660 --> 1:38:49.900\n is the simple stuff, the little stuff.\n\n1:38:52.620 --> 1:38:55.700\n Outside of Keith Richards,\n\n1:38:55.700 --> 1:38:58.580\n who is the greatest, ridiculous question,\n\n1:38:58.580 --> 1:39:00.140\n but just indulge me,\n\n1:39:00.140 --> 1:39:03.140\n who is the greatest blues guitarist of all time,\n\n1:39:03.140 --> 1:39:04.620\n rock guitarist of all time?\n\n1:39:05.660 --> 1:39:07.180\n Well, you got a little bit of a hybrid\n\n1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:08.460\n with Jimi Hendrix, right?\n\n1:39:08.460 --> 1:39:11.380\n Because he played the blues and he played rock and roll.\n\n1:39:11.380 --> 1:39:14.540\n So I think most guitarists would say\n\n1:39:14.540 --> 1:39:17.900\n Jimi Hendrix was pretty ridiculous.\n\n1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:19.100\n That probably for me,\n\n1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:21.660\n I'm a huge, huge, huge Hendrix fan to play.\n\n1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:24.740\n He can't, I mean, even to this day,\n\n1:39:24.740 --> 1:39:27.180\n I don't care, technology, pedals, whatever,\n\n1:39:27.180 --> 1:39:31.460\n he just somehow fused with the instrument.\n\n1:39:31.460 --> 1:39:34.660\n I can't be sitting here in Austin, Texas\n\n1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:37.900\n without mentioning one of the great guitar players\n\n1:39:37.900 --> 1:39:40.220\n of all time, Stevie Ray Vaughn.\n\n1:39:40.220 --> 1:39:42.260\n See, that's how, I know you're like a rock star.\n\n1:39:42.260 --> 1:39:43.780\n You're sucking up to the audience.\n\n1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:47.460\n Well, no, you have listeners all over the place,\n\n1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:51.020\n but Stevie Ray Vaughn is another one of those.\n\n1:39:51.020 --> 1:39:51.860\n That is incredible.\n\n1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:53.620\n Just blows me away.\n\n1:39:55.180 --> 1:39:57.100\n And then with the older guys,\n\n1:39:57.100 --> 1:40:01.020\n BB King, Hubert Sumlin, Clapton.\n\n1:40:01.020 --> 1:40:06.020\n I saw him on his last tour\n\n1:40:06.340 --> 1:40:08.860\n and just walked out on my,\n\n1:40:09.900 --> 1:40:12.660\n just like unbelievable how he still sounds.\n\n1:40:14.660 --> 1:40:18.580\n And both electric and acoustic, just so strange.\n\n1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:19.660\n Absolute master.\n\n1:40:20.900 --> 1:40:23.980\n And the greatest storyteller, you mentioned Bob Seger.\n\n1:40:23.980 --> 1:40:26.260\n That's an interesting one.\n\n1:40:26.260 --> 1:40:30.620\n He almost doesn't get enough credit, I feel like,\n\n1:40:30.620 --> 1:40:31.500\n for how great he is.\n\n1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:33.340\n Obviously he's super famous, but.\n\n1:40:33.340 --> 1:40:36.500\n No, he's, and his voice.\n\n1:40:36.500 --> 1:40:39.180\n I also, I had the privilege of getting friendly\n\n1:40:39.180 --> 1:40:43.580\n with John Fogerty, you know, John Fogerty and CCR fame.\n\n1:40:43.580 --> 1:40:48.100\n And he's another one that's just the way he phrases things.\n\n1:40:48.100 --> 1:40:51.200\n And you just look at the catalog of stuff he wrote.\n\n1:40:52.780 --> 1:40:54.000\n Amazing talent.\n\n1:40:54.900 --> 1:40:59.580\n I read Bruce Springsteen's book\n\n1:40:59.580 --> 1:41:02.860\n and was, I'm a fan, but after reading the book,\n\n1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:05.820\n it was really, you go back and listen to his lyrics\n\n1:41:05.820 --> 1:41:10.820\n and the way he pours himself out is pretty incredible.\n\n1:41:13.500 --> 1:41:16.040\n And then again, with the old blues guys,\n\n1:41:17.420 --> 1:41:20.660\n I just think the emotion they could get out of\n\n1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:23.060\n playing like, staying on the one, right?\n\n1:41:23.060 --> 1:41:25.180\n Just playing the same rhythm.\n\n1:41:25.180 --> 1:41:27.160\n John Lee Hooker.\n\n1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:31.180\n You listen to Manish Boy by Muddy Waters\n\n1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:36.140\n and it's just, there's something so,\n\n1:41:36.140 --> 1:41:38.160\n it just draws me in every time.\n\n1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:40.880\n And the emotion they're able to get out of things.\n\n1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:44.420\n And I'm also a huge Chuck Berry fan.\n\n1:41:44.420 --> 1:41:47.040\n I just think that sound is, I love it.\n\n1:41:48.900 --> 1:41:51.080\n Do you know how to play Johnny B. Goode?\n\n1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:51.920\n I do.\n\n1:41:53.780 --> 1:41:55.000\n That's good.\n\n1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:59.020\n Maybe one of the great moments, at least of my childhood,\n\n1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:04.020\n was back to the future and watching Michael J. Fox plug in\n\n1:42:06.060 --> 1:42:09.340\n and then at the end, play at the dance\n\n1:42:09.340 --> 1:42:11.940\n to save his parents with Johnny B. Goode, pretty awesome.\n\n1:42:11.940 --> 1:42:14.780\n Yeah, the guitar is so much more than a musical instrument.\n\n1:42:14.780 --> 1:42:17.460\n It feels like, it's like the,\n\n1:42:17.460 --> 1:42:20.420\n in the 20th century, it's like the car.\n\n1:42:20.420 --> 1:42:22.980\n Like it defines so much of Hollywood,\n\n1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:25.860\n so much of a generation of what it means to be,\n\n1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:28.800\n I don't know, what it means to be a man,\n\n1:42:28.800 --> 1:42:31.100\n what it means to be a human in America.\n\n1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:32.660\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:37.140\n Emblematic to me of a certain type of music.\n\n1:42:37.140 --> 1:42:37.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:37.980 --> 1:42:40.460\n And that's, I made a documentary years ago\n\n1:42:40.460 --> 1:42:43.820\n called It Might Get Loud with Jimmy Page, The Edge.\n\n1:42:43.820 --> 1:42:46.540\n I highly recommend that everybody watch that documentary.\n\n1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:48.980\n It's an incredible celebration of the guitar.\n\n1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:53.540\n Yeah, it says Jimmy Page, Jack White from White Stripes.\n\n1:42:53.540 --> 1:42:54.380\n The Edge.\n\n1:42:54.380 --> 1:42:56.500\n And The Edge from U2.\n\n1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:57.340\n Okay, all right.\n\n1:42:57.340 --> 1:42:59.260\n Well, now you have to tell the story of that one\n\n1:42:59.260 --> 1:43:02.460\n because how the heck did that all come together?\n\n1:43:02.460 --> 1:43:03.540\n Because it's so fascinating,\n\n1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:07.360\n such different musicians all coming together,\n\n1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:09.780\n talking about their story,\n\n1:43:09.780 --> 1:43:11.520\n talking about how they approach the music\n\n1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:13.760\n and also playing together a little bit\n\n1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:15.380\n in this casual kind of setting.\n\n1:43:15.380 --> 1:43:18.820\n Well, look, one day I came downstairs\n\n1:43:18.820 --> 1:43:21.060\n and the Rolling Stone magazine is sitting there\n\n1:43:21.060 --> 1:43:25.900\n and it was the 50 top guitarists of all time, their list.\n\n1:43:25.900 --> 1:43:29.500\n And then I had some other financial report with video games\n\n1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:32.940\n and the top video game at the time was Guitar Hero, right?\n\n1:43:32.940 --> 1:43:35.220\n And then there was a third thing, I can't recall it,\n\n1:43:35.220 --> 1:43:37.340\n but I just, and I said to myself,\n\n1:43:37.340 --> 1:43:42.340\n what is it about the guitar that is so central\n\n1:43:42.580 --> 1:43:45.020\n to the rock and roll, whatever you wanna call it?\n\n1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:46.940\n Like, why is that the symbol?\n\n1:43:46.940 --> 1:43:51.940\n And I said to myself, I wanna ask Jimmy Page\n\n1:43:52.060 --> 1:43:54.220\n why he picked up the guitar,\n\n1:43:54.220 --> 1:43:56.160\n because he's Jimmy Page, right?\n\n1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:00.520\n And so I called a friend of mine, Davis Guggenheim,\n\n1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:02.580\n who had directed Inconvenient Truth,\n\n1:44:02.580 --> 1:44:03.680\n and I think still is,\n\n1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:06.780\n but at the time was the biggest documentary ever.\n\n1:44:06.780 --> 1:44:09.100\n And I called Davis and I said, look, I have this idea.\n\n1:44:09.100 --> 1:44:12.960\n I wanna make this movie about the guitar,\n\n1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:15.520\n about different eras and styles and whatever,\n\n1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:16.980\n but I've never made a documentary.\n\n1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:18.140\n I don't know how to do that.\n\n1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:20.420\n So I was just looking for advice.\n\n1:44:20.420 --> 1:44:24.160\n And thankfully, because he's one\n\n1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:27.920\n of the best documentarians ever, Davis is like,\n\n1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:29.540\n you know what, I can't get this out of my head.\n\n1:44:29.540 --> 1:44:32.500\n I'll direct it, which was amazing.\n\n1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:34.540\n And we wrote three names down\n\n1:44:34.540 --> 1:44:38.220\n that represented different eras and different styles.\n\n1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:41.760\n Rarely do you get, you go three for three,\n\n1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:44.740\n but it was those three guys.\n\n1:44:44.740 --> 1:44:49.740\n And it was just such a incredible experience\n\n1:44:49.940 --> 1:44:53.580\n to sit there and get to know Jimmy Page.\n\n1:44:53.580 --> 1:44:55.060\n You know, I mean, it was like,\n\n1:44:55.060 --> 1:44:57.580\n and he was like Gandalf, man.\n\n1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:00.340\n He was like always Jimmy Page.\n\n1:45:00.340 --> 1:45:02.060\n And...\n\n1:45:02.060 --> 1:45:03.780\n That was so cool to see him.\n\n1:45:03.780 --> 1:45:06.700\n Gandalf was, there's like a wisdom,\n\n1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:08.820\n there's a calmness to him compared\n\n1:45:08.820 --> 1:45:12.620\n to like the restlessness of Jack White.\n\n1:45:12.620 --> 1:45:16.780\n Like the, I mean, that combination was just fascinating.\n\n1:45:16.780 --> 1:45:19.780\n It was one of the coolest experiences ever.\n\n1:45:19.780 --> 1:45:22.140\n And one of the things, there was a moment\n\n1:45:22.140 --> 1:45:26.240\n where Jimmy, he was going through his guitar case\n\n1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:28.180\n and he had the double neck from stairway to heaven\n\n1:45:28.180 --> 1:45:30.700\n and he handed it to me and I was like, mm hmm.\n\n1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:36.940\n I mean, it's like somebody handing you X caliber or something.\n\n1:45:36.940 --> 1:45:38.140\n Amazing experience.\n\n1:45:38.140 --> 1:45:40.980\n And The Edge, one of the kindest human beings\n\n1:45:40.980 --> 1:45:42.660\n you'll ever meet in your life.\n\n1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:44.900\n Just an amazing person.\n\n1:45:44.900 --> 1:45:47.060\n And I think he hit it right on the head with Jack\n\n1:45:47.060 --> 1:45:49.820\n is he's got that energy, you know,\n\n1:45:49.820 --> 1:45:52.240\n and constantly pushing himself.\n\n1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:55.380\n But it's hard to believe it's been, I think 10 or 11\n\n1:45:55.380 --> 1:45:58.100\n or maybe even 12 years since it came out, but.\n\n1:45:58.100 --> 1:46:02.700\n After watching it, I realized like how much it was needed.\n\n1:46:02.700 --> 1:46:07.340\n And I was almost surprised it didn't already exist.\n\n1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:12.300\n It was like, yeah, the guitar wasn't quite celebrated\n\n1:46:12.300 --> 1:46:13.180\n like explicitly.\n\n1:46:13.180 --> 1:46:14.760\n We almost didn't acknowledge it.\n\n1:46:15.700 --> 1:46:17.660\n How important it was culturally.\n\n1:46:17.660 --> 1:46:18.500\n It's kind of amazing.\n\n1:46:18.500 --> 1:46:20.540\n And the way it closed from the song, the.\n\n1:46:20.540 --> 1:46:21.380\n The Wait.\n\n1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:23.400\n It was called The Wait, yeah, by the band.\n\n1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:24.660\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n1:46:24.660 --> 1:46:26.860\n That's because they didn't want to go home.\n\n1:46:26.860 --> 1:46:30.000\n We were shooting on a Warner Brothers soundstage\n\n1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.020\n for three days when we called it The Summit\n\n1:46:32.020 --> 1:46:34.300\n where the three of them came together.\n\n1:46:34.300 --> 1:46:36.420\n And the two things I'll never forget\n\n1:46:36.420 --> 1:46:39.700\n is when Jimmy starts to play the riff\n\n1:46:39.700 --> 1:46:40.820\n from Whole Lotta Love.\n\n1:46:40.820 --> 1:46:41.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:46.420\n Edge and Jack ceased to be rock, you know,\n\n1:46:46.420 --> 1:46:47.620\n rock gods or whatever,\n\n1:46:47.620 --> 1:46:51.620\n and had the same 15 year old kid feeling that I did.\n\n1:46:51.620 --> 1:46:53.340\n You could see in their face.\n\n1:46:53.340 --> 1:46:55.620\n And then at the end, they're like, hey, can we play?\n\n1:46:55.620 --> 1:46:57.040\n We just want to, we don't want to go.\n\n1:46:57.040 --> 1:46:59.580\n Can we just play something acoustically?\n\n1:46:59.580 --> 1:47:00.860\n So we printed out the lyrics.\n\n1:47:00.860 --> 1:47:01.960\n That's what they wanted to play.\n\n1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:05.420\n And they just sat there and sat on those couches\n\n1:47:05.420 --> 1:47:06.540\n and just.\n\n1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:07.540\n Such a good way to end.\n\n1:47:07.540 --> 1:47:08.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:09.400\n Incredible.\n\n1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:12.460\n What's your guitar rig setup like?\n\n1:47:12.460 --> 1:47:15.340\n You have a few guitars.\n\n1:47:15.340 --> 1:47:17.540\n First, let's just put on the line.\n\n1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:21.820\n So what's better, Les Paul or Strat?\n\n1:47:21.820 --> 1:47:24.420\n Well, I'm not going to get into what's better\n\n1:47:24.420 --> 1:47:26.340\n because I'm sure that'll start a flood of whatever.\n\n1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:27.840\n For me.\n\n1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:29.180\n I'm going to say it's Strat.\n\n1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:30.020\n All right.\n\n1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:31.980\n I'm a Les Paul.\n\n1:47:31.980 --> 1:47:34.700\n My main instrument is a Les Paul.\n\n1:47:34.700 --> 1:47:36.700\n But I, okay, let me just put it on the table.\n\n1:47:36.700 --> 1:47:39.020\n I'm speaking as somebody who literally,\n\n1:47:39.020 --> 1:47:41.660\n I don't think I've ever actually strummed a chord\n\n1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:42.500\n on a Les Paul.\n\n1:47:42.500 --> 1:47:45.340\n So I've been, maybe I'm uninitiated.\n\n1:47:45.340 --> 1:47:46.180\n Exactly.\n\n1:47:46.180 --> 1:47:47.980\n So I don't, I don't speak from experience,\n\n1:47:47.980 --> 1:47:50.500\n but it's probably because of Hendrix\n\n1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:52.200\n is so deeply influenced by Hendrix\n\n1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:55.220\n that I just kind of follow in his footsteps\n\n1:47:55.220 --> 1:47:56.640\n and clap them and so on.\n\n1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:01.100\n The amazing thing to me is if you look back at Leo Fender\n\n1:48:01.100 --> 1:48:03.620\n and what the Gibson Guitar Company and Les Paul did\n\n1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:07.460\n in the fifties, those are still the shapes\n\n1:48:07.460 --> 1:48:09.700\n and the perfect thing today, right?\n\n1:48:09.700 --> 1:48:12.940\n The Strat and the Telecaster and the Les Paul.\n\n1:48:12.940 --> 1:48:15.660\n And it's, they got it right way back, way back then.\n\n1:48:15.660 --> 1:48:20.660\n So I have my main guitar, you got to name your guitar.\n\n1:48:21.300 --> 1:48:26.300\n So my main guitar is named Hazel and it's a 59 Les Paul.\n\n1:48:26.300 --> 1:48:31.020\n And there's something magical in that year,\n\n1:48:31.020 --> 1:48:34.160\n like a Stradivarius and they're just,\n\n1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:36.900\n there's something different about them.\n\n1:48:36.900 --> 1:48:41.900\n So I play that and then I play it through sort of\n\n1:48:41.980 --> 1:48:46.980\n my main rig is either a 59 Fender Twin or a 65 Marshall.\n\n1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:52.880\n And then when we're on the road now,\n\n1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:54.900\n cause when you use older vintage stuff,\n\n1:48:54.900 --> 1:48:56.980\n you just got to be super careful with the tubes\n\n1:48:56.980 --> 1:48:58.760\n and everything, it has to be reliable.\n\n1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:01.340\n So very nicely, the guys from Two Rock\n\n1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:03.660\n sent me some of their amps and they're really,\n\n1:49:03.660 --> 1:49:05.500\n cause I don't use any new stuff,\n\n1:49:05.500 --> 1:49:07.480\n but the Two Rock stuff is pretty great.\n\n1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:08.320\n So that's actually what I'm using.\n\n1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:11.120\n Oh, it gets close to the sound that you like\n\n1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:11.960\n with the Marshall.\n\n1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:14.020\n Yeah, it's new and reliable.\n\n1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:15.460\n So that's what I'm using on the road right now.\n\n1:49:15.460 --> 1:49:17.240\n Do people use like emulation?\n\n1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:18.200\n Do they use software?\n\n1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:19.220\n Is it still?\n\n1:49:19.220 --> 1:49:20.060\n They do.\n\n1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:23.680\n I personally don't, I go, I don't have many pedals.\n\n1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:28.020\n I use a Klon, an old vintage Klon straight into the amp.\n\n1:49:28.020 --> 1:49:30.980\n As old school as possible.\n\n1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:32.500\n Is there other cool guitars you have\n\n1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:34.540\n that kind of stand out?\n\n1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:38.320\n I have a bunch of what they call Blackguard Telecasters\n\n1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:42.140\n from the 50s, which are pretty great.\n\n1:49:42.140 --> 1:49:44.020\n What are those, Blackguard Telecasters?\n\n1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:45.780\n Yeah, so they just, you know, it's in the 50s.\n\n1:49:45.780 --> 1:49:47.900\n Oh, they actually legit have a Blackguard.\n\n1:49:47.900 --> 1:49:48.740\n Pickguard.\n\n1:49:48.740 --> 1:49:49.580\n Got it.\n\n1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:51.300\n But they're incredible, so.\n\n1:49:51.300 --> 1:49:53.220\n What's the color of the Telecaster itself?\n\n1:49:53.220 --> 1:49:55.200\n Most of them are yellow with black\n\n1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:57.400\n and then they got into different configurations,\n\n1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:01.580\n but there's something, I have a 51 Telecaster\n\n1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:04.720\n that I play in Open G, and in songs with Open G,\n\n1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:09.020\n that just, again, there's something, you know,\n\n1:50:09.020 --> 1:50:11.020\n and I'll take all the help I can get\n\n1:50:11.020 --> 1:50:13.200\n in terms of making it sound great.\n\n1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:15.840\n So I'll try to find the magic ones.\n\n1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:18.120\n What's your writing process like\n\n1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:21.620\n for the music and the lyrics?\n\n1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:26.120\n Is there, do you have to go to the mountains?\n\n1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:27.620\n Is there whiskey involved?\n\n1:50:27.620 --> 1:50:28.700\n What do you have to do?\n\n1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:29.900\n Or do you just write a little bit\n\n1:50:29.900 --> 1:50:31.780\n whenever you have a moment of free time?\n\n1:50:31.780 --> 1:50:33.780\n I'm a boring guy, because I don't drink.\n\n1:50:33.780 --> 1:50:37.600\n I don't, I just, I figure I can screw things up plenty\n\n1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:39.780\n on my own without adding anything.\n\n1:50:39.780 --> 1:50:40.940\n It's a good call.\n\n1:50:40.940 --> 1:50:45.940\n But, you know, for me, it either starts with a riff,\n\n1:50:46.380 --> 1:50:49.920\n just something that I think is an interesting,\n\n1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:54.220\n you know, riff or tone that I can kind of sink my teeth\n\n1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:55.780\n into a little bit.\n\n1:50:55.780 --> 1:51:00.140\n And a lot of times I'll write a title and love a title\n\n1:51:00.140 --> 1:51:02.540\n and then start to back it up.\n\n1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:04.420\n So the title is almost like an idea.\n\n1:51:04.420 --> 1:51:06.900\n Yeah, like this is where I want to be\n\n1:51:07.940 --> 1:51:10.260\n and then start kind of writing it out.\n\n1:51:10.260 --> 1:51:13.940\n And again, I just have to know,\n\n1:51:13.940 --> 1:51:16.500\n am I writing from a character's point of view?\n\n1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:19.860\n Am I writing about someone or something,\n\n1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:22.060\n you know, as like the narrator?\n\n1:51:22.060 --> 1:51:23.700\n And, you know, what is this person?\n\n1:51:23.700 --> 1:51:24.540\n Are they happy?\n\n1:51:24.540 --> 1:51:25.380\n Are they sad?\n\n1:51:25.380 --> 1:51:26.220\n Are they happy?\n\n1:51:26.220 --> 1:51:27.300\n Where are they in life?\n\n1:51:27.300 --> 1:51:29.900\n I don't know if all that, like,\n\n1:51:29.900 --> 1:51:32.460\n great writers, I'm sure, would say,\n\n1:51:32.460 --> 1:51:34.140\n why don't you just write?\n\n1:51:34.140 --> 1:51:36.060\n You don't need all that.\n\n1:51:36.060 --> 1:51:38.380\n But that's, for me, that's my process.\n\n1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:39.940\n Well, I'm not so sure about that.\n\n1:51:39.940 --> 1:51:43.540\n I bet you quite a lot of writers have\n\n1:51:43.540 --> 1:51:45.900\n created a world in their mind\n\n1:51:45.900 --> 1:51:48.780\n before they even put the simplest of words down.\n\n1:51:48.780 --> 1:51:51.620\n So yeah, there's quite a lot to that.\n\n1:51:51.620 --> 1:51:52.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:54.980 --> 1:51:56.620\n What's your favorite song to play?\n\n1:51:57.780 --> 1:52:00.580\n Is there some favorite ones you go to?\n\n1:52:00.580 --> 1:52:04.500\n But both play and kind of, I'm sure you love singing.\n\n1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:05.420\n Oh, no, no, no.\n\n1:52:05.420 --> 1:52:06.780\n No, you don't?\n\n1:52:06.780 --> 1:52:10.860\n I'm not, I'm neither talented nor do I have the desire.\n\n1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:14.220\n And I think, you know, if you come see the show,\n\n1:52:14.220 --> 1:52:16.500\n you won't see a microphone anywhere near me.\n\n1:52:16.500 --> 1:52:18.020\n But do you, I mean, do you hear,\n\n1:52:18.020 --> 1:52:19.420\n like when you're thinking about lyrics,\n\n1:52:19.420 --> 1:52:21.860\n do you hear the idea of the words?\n\n1:52:21.860 --> 1:52:22.700\n 100%.\n\n1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:26.300\n And especially what's great with Trey\n\n1:52:26.300 --> 1:52:28.620\n is I write for his voice.\n\n1:52:28.620 --> 1:52:32.180\n And then we have these amazing backup singers\n\n1:52:32.180 --> 1:52:35.220\n that are just, and I can hear all of it,\n\n1:52:35.220 --> 1:52:36.500\n I just can't do it.\n\n1:52:37.860 --> 1:52:41.700\n And so I'd say of our stuff,\n\n1:52:41.700 --> 1:52:44.420\n there's a song called Half My Fault\n\n1:52:44.420 --> 1:52:47.340\n that I play in Open G that just,\n\n1:52:47.340 --> 1:52:49.060\n I love playing the song.\n\n1:52:49.060 --> 1:52:50.540\n I love that energy.\n\n1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:53.980\n And then there's, we have a new blues album coming out\n\n1:52:53.980 --> 1:52:58.980\n and there's a song called Baby We're Through\n\n1:52:59.220 --> 1:53:01.300\n and it just stays on the one.\n\n1:53:01.300 --> 1:53:03.860\n And if for non musicians, that means,\n\n1:53:03.860 --> 1:53:05.580\n like in a lot of rock and roll and blues,\n\n1:53:05.580 --> 1:53:09.340\n it's what's called a one, four, five progression\n\n1:53:09.340 --> 1:53:11.020\n from your kind of root note.\n\n1:53:11.020 --> 1:53:13.140\n And you would hear, if you're a non musician,\n\n1:53:13.140 --> 1:53:14.180\n if you heard it, you'd be like,\n\n1:53:14.180 --> 1:53:16.540\n oh yeah, that's a lot of songs.\n\n1:53:16.540 --> 1:53:18.980\n And this song just stays on the same groove.\n\n1:53:18.980 --> 1:53:23.420\n Like La Grange or Shake Your Hips or any of those songs.\n\n1:53:23.420 --> 1:53:26.900\n And it's just got this unbelievable energy\n\n1:53:26.900 --> 1:53:27.740\n and it's fun to play,\n\n1:53:27.740 --> 1:53:31.340\n but I have to keep the same rhythmic thing going\n\n1:53:31.340 --> 1:53:32.820\n for the whole song.\n\n1:53:32.820 --> 1:53:33.980\n With that simplicity, I mean,\n\n1:53:33.980 --> 1:53:36.660\n the personality of the song can really shine.\n\n1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:41.660\n I mean, Trey's, I mean, that guy, really cool.\n\n1:53:42.180 --> 1:53:44.060\n He just comes through.\n\n1:53:44.060 --> 1:53:45.700\n I mean, I guess you need that from a lead singer.\n\n1:53:45.700 --> 1:53:47.380\n He's just, he's just.\n\n1:53:47.380 --> 1:53:50.180\n You gotta have that, and my other guitar player,\n\n1:53:50.180 --> 1:53:53.980\n Johnny Bob is, he's a phenomenal,\n\n1:53:53.980 --> 1:53:57.340\n I mean, like a legitimate guitar slinger.\n\n1:53:58.940 --> 1:54:03.260\n You know, we probably split the leads 70, 30,\n\n1:54:03.260 --> 1:54:06.100\n and he is just, you know,\n\n1:54:06.100 --> 1:54:07.980\n there's times sometimes I look over at him\n\n1:54:07.980 --> 1:54:09.460\n and I'm like, I'm being a fan right now\n\n1:54:09.460 --> 1:54:12.660\n because what you just laid down is pretty good.\n\n1:54:12.660 --> 1:54:16.260\n From a lead perspective, what's the most fun thing to play?\n\n1:54:16.260 --> 1:54:18.460\n What kind of stuff do you, do you like slow?\n\n1:54:18.460 --> 1:54:21.780\n Do you like, I mean, if you, like, thrill is gone.\n\n1:54:21.780 --> 1:54:23.020\n So if you look at B.B. King,\n\n1:54:23.020 --> 1:54:25.820\n sometimes one note just bending the shit out of that.\n\n1:54:25.820 --> 1:54:27.460\n What do you call that, vibrato?\n\n1:54:27.460 --> 1:54:30.260\n If I'm gonna play the lead, it's a certain kind of feel.\n\n1:54:30.260 --> 1:54:33.860\n Slow blues is probably my favorite to play,\n\n1:54:33.860 --> 1:54:35.460\n or something that's got a little more\n\n1:54:35.460 --> 1:54:37.820\n of that Chuck Berry drive\n\n1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:39.980\n where you can be rhythmic in the lead.\n\n1:54:41.980 --> 1:54:45.220\n You know, I can't, the shredding thing that those guys do\n\n1:54:45.220 --> 1:54:47.580\n is, that's not my.\n\n1:54:47.580 --> 1:54:51.340\n I was actually always able to do that really well.\n\n1:54:51.340 --> 1:54:53.540\n Like, you mentioned people that pick up fast,\n\n1:54:53.540 --> 1:54:55.820\n like, maybe it's the classical piano training.\n\n1:54:55.820 --> 1:54:58.820\n I can play super fast on guitar, super technical.\n\n1:54:58.820 --> 1:55:02.020\n But to me, the hardest thing and my favorite thing\n\n1:55:02.020 --> 1:55:06.340\n is just, it's probably less to do with the guitar,\n\n1:55:06.340 --> 1:55:09.940\n more living on life that's worth playing a guitar for.\n\n1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:13.580\n It's like a certain kind of emotion\n\n1:55:13.580 --> 1:55:15.500\n that you can put into the notes.\n\n1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:17.580\n And that has to do with bending notes well.\n\n1:55:17.580 --> 1:55:20.820\n Like, bending notes is a whole other art form of,\n\n1:55:22.540 --> 1:55:26.340\n I worked surprisingly a long time on Comfortably Numb.\n\n1:55:28.540 --> 1:55:31.940\n And there's, so David Gilmour, there's a lot of bending.\n\n1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:35.300\n And they're simple, they sound simple.\n\n1:55:35.300 --> 1:55:39.260\n But the dynamics of them,\n\n1:55:40.140 --> 1:55:43.300\n to express like a build up in the way it's held\n\n1:55:43.300 --> 1:55:46.980\n and there's often a vibrato at the top for a bit.\n\n1:55:46.980 --> 1:55:51.980\n Just that, it's almost like a sigh\n\n1:55:52.620 --> 1:55:54.420\n and a sigh of relief and the build up.\n\n1:55:54.420 --> 1:55:58.100\n I mean, that's an art form for him that's hard to get right.\n\n1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:00.220\n It's not just playing a note, playing a note,\n\n1:56:00.220 --> 1:56:04.660\n playing a note, it's in that like dynamic movement\n\n1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:06.420\n of a note that so much can happen.\n\n1:56:06.420 --> 1:56:08.900\n That's where the blues happens to.\n\n1:56:08.900 --> 1:56:11.420\n Look, I'm a huge Freddie King fan too, right?\n\n1:56:11.420 --> 1:56:14.380\n And you listen to these guys and they're,\n\n1:56:15.980 --> 1:56:17.020\n you sit there and they're like,\n\n1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:21.420\n man, you're playing in a small range on the neck.\n\n1:56:22.540 --> 1:56:26.860\n But, you know, it's like, I know the notes you're playing\n\n1:56:26.860 --> 1:56:30.340\n and I'm playing them too, but not like that, right?\n\n1:56:30.340 --> 1:56:33.420\n I mean, it's, and Gilmour is certainly one of those guys\n\n1:56:33.420 --> 1:56:35.980\n that's an incredible guitar player.\n\n1:56:35.980 --> 1:56:40.500\n And yet another chapter of an amazing life.\n\n1:56:40.500 --> 1:56:41.940\n You love football, like you mentioned.\n\n1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:43.020\n You play football?\n\n1:56:43.020 --> 1:56:43.860\n Yes.\n\n1:56:43.860 --> 1:56:44.700\n What position do you play?\n\n1:56:44.700 --> 1:56:45.520\n Wide receiver.\n\n1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:46.360\n Wide receiver.\n\n1:56:47.420 --> 1:56:48.260\n Awesome.\n\n1:56:48.260 --> 1:56:52.780\n So, maybe we can talk a little bit about your love\n\n1:56:52.780 --> 1:56:57.780\n of football and the fact that you are part owner\n\n1:56:58.700 --> 1:57:00.740\n of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n1:57:00.740 --> 1:57:01.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:57:01.580 --> 1:57:02.820\n So, I mean, where do we start?\n\n1:57:02.820 --> 1:57:05.220\n You start at the beginning, let's start at the end.\n\n1:57:05.220 --> 1:57:06.780\n Why the Steelers?\n\n1:57:06.780 --> 1:57:09.580\n What attracted you to the, first of all,\n\n1:57:09.580 --> 1:57:12.620\n I think not to be controversial,\n\n1:57:12.620 --> 1:57:15.980\n but one of the best uniforms in football\n\n1:57:15.980 --> 1:57:19.100\n in terms of just the black and gold, just.\n\n1:57:19.100 --> 1:57:20.860\n Decal only on one side.\n\n1:57:20.860 --> 1:57:21.860\n Yeah, it's great.\n\n1:57:21.860 --> 1:57:23.100\n Yeah, the helmet.\n\n1:57:23.100 --> 1:57:27.100\n Look, I've bled black and gold since I was a little boy.\n\n1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:29.540\n I grew up in upstate New York.\n\n1:57:29.540 --> 1:57:32.420\n And the first football game I ever saw\n\n1:57:32.420 --> 1:57:35.740\n was the Steelers in the Super Bowl is a really little kit.\n\n1:57:35.740 --> 1:57:39.940\n And it just, I mean, Jack Lambert and Joe Green\n\n1:57:39.940 --> 1:57:41.900\n and Franco Harris and those guys were like,\n\n1:57:41.900 --> 1:57:45.660\n came down from Olympia, Mount Olympus or something.\n\n1:57:45.660 --> 1:57:48.500\n And I just was enamored with the team.\n\n1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:50.780\n And because we only had three channels,\n\n1:57:50.780 --> 1:57:53.060\n the only time I'd get to see them is occasionally\n\n1:57:53.060 --> 1:57:55.600\n when they were the game of the week or something.\n\n1:57:57.020 --> 1:58:02.020\n And I just loved to me what they stood for, the toughness\n\n1:58:02.020 --> 1:58:07.020\n and they played football the way that I thought was great.\n\n1:58:08.140 --> 1:58:10.060\n I was a huge Jack Lambert fan,\n\n1:58:11.020 --> 1:58:15.820\n our Hall of Fame linebacker who just intimidated everybody.\n\n1:58:15.820 --> 1:58:16.940\n So that was like the,\n\n1:58:16.940 --> 1:58:19.360\n that was the decade of the steel curtain.\n\n1:58:21.500 --> 1:58:24.580\n I mean, arguably one of the great sort of defensive\n\n1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:28.620\n in football history and also one of the greatest\n\n1:58:28.620 --> 1:58:32.380\n football teams period of in football history.\n\n1:58:32.380 --> 1:58:37.220\n I've been a lifelong fan and was very fortunate\n\n1:58:37.220 --> 1:58:38.780\n to meet Mr. Rooney.\n\n1:58:39.820 --> 1:58:43.000\n The Rooney family started the team in 1933,\n\n1:58:44.060 --> 1:58:48.860\n got to know him and just was asked to be part\n\n1:58:48.860 --> 1:58:49.740\n of the ownership group.\n\n1:58:49.740 --> 1:58:52.520\n I think it was the end of 2007,\n\n1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:54.500\n first year as part of the group in 2008,\n\n1:58:54.500 --> 1:58:56.100\n we won the Super Bowl.\n\n1:58:56.100 --> 1:59:01.100\n And it was like beyond surreal and just beyond surreal.\n\n1:59:01.860 --> 1:59:06.860\n And it's amazing to be able to do.\n\n1:59:07.860 --> 1:59:12.860\n I mean, the Rooney family is one of those most revered\n\n1:59:13.020 --> 1:59:16.780\n in sports for the way they conduct themselves.\n\n1:59:16.780 --> 1:59:20.980\n Mr. Rooney passed away, I think five years ago now\n\n1:59:20.980 --> 1:59:23.960\n and we lost him, but was a champion, helped build the league.\n\n1:59:23.960 --> 1:59:27.300\n I mean, put the league as we know it together.\n\n1:59:27.300 --> 1:59:29.860\n More importantly, it was a civil rights champion\n\n1:59:30.820 --> 1:59:33.380\n who created what we now call the Rooney rule\n\n1:59:34.220 --> 1:59:36.020\n to make sure that we're being fair\n\n1:59:36.020 --> 1:59:40.460\n about giving minority coaches a chance to get hired.\n\n1:59:40.460 --> 1:59:44.700\n And just is one of the most kind\n\n1:59:44.700 --> 1:59:47.880\n and amazing human beings I ever met.\n\n1:59:47.880 --> 1:59:51.960\n It's incredible what sport does.\n\n1:59:51.960 --> 1:59:56.000\n Like to bring out the best in people,\n\n1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.360\n to give people hope, to inspire people.\n\n1:59:58.360 --> 1:59:59.880\n There's something about football\n\n1:59:59.880 --> 2:00:04.880\n that has all the elements of a great sport.\n\n2:00:04.900 --> 2:00:09.900\n It's the teamwork, it's the sort of the combat aspect of it.\n\n2:00:10.320 --> 2:00:11.880\n It's like, it's the purity of it.\n\n2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:16.880\n It's of like strength and power and speed\n\n2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:21.700\n and all the elements of like last minute,\n\n2:00:21.700 --> 2:00:25.100\n close calls required to win the game.\n\n2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:28.140\n And where referee decisions, of course,\n\n2:00:28.140 --> 2:00:30.940\n that's essential for a sport can screw up the whole thing.\n\n2:00:30.940 --> 2:00:32.220\n Just got all of it together.\n\n2:00:32.220 --> 2:00:36.980\n I think just, I don't know, it gives the drama\n\n2:00:36.980 --> 2:00:40.060\n and the triumphs are just beautiful.\n\n2:00:40.060 --> 2:00:42.500\n Like some of my favorite memories,\n\n2:00:42.500 --> 2:00:43.700\n I don't know if it's an accident\n\n2:00:43.700 --> 2:00:45.640\n or this is common with people,\n\n2:00:45.640 --> 2:00:48.340\n it's just with friends watching football\n\n2:00:48.340 --> 2:00:50.020\n and connecting over that.\n\n2:00:51.300 --> 2:00:54.180\n Yeah, well, look, it's an incredible game\n\n2:00:54.180 --> 2:00:56.100\n because there's nowhere to hide, right?\n\n2:00:56.100 --> 2:00:57.700\n You're out there on the field.\n\n2:00:57.700 --> 2:01:02.100\n You know, it's a great game that requires\n\n2:01:02.100 --> 2:01:04.340\n not only all those attributes that you said,\n\n2:01:04.340 --> 2:01:07.600\n but it's incredibly complex game.\n\n2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:09.180\n So if you don't know what you're looking at\n\n2:01:09.180 --> 2:01:11.660\n and you don't understand how complex\n\n2:01:11.660 --> 2:01:14.900\n defenses are trying to disguise what they're doing,\n\n2:01:14.900 --> 2:01:17.060\n offenses are trying to overcome that\n\n2:01:17.060 --> 2:01:22.060\n and you can set up one play the entire game,\n\n2:01:22.300 --> 2:01:26.960\n but a team that plays well together, right?\n\n2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:28.340\n Knows their plays inside and out,\n\n2:01:28.340 --> 2:01:30.420\n knows their assignments inside and out,\n\n2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:33.940\n can overcome and beat a more physically gifted team\n\n2:01:33.940 --> 2:01:38.780\n because of that aspect of working together.\n\n2:01:38.780 --> 2:01:43.020\n One of the things that I always loved about sports\n\n2:01:43.020 --> 2:01:47.260\n is just you're out there, there's a set of rules\n\n2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:48.980\n and there's a scoreboard.\n\n2:01:48.980 --> 2:01:51.900\n So at the end of that game, it says,\n\n2:01:51.900 --> 2:01:54.440\n and you can make excuses about the refs\n\n2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:55.620\n or this happened or that happened,\n\n2:01:55.620 --> 2:02:00.620\n but at the end of the day, did you go out and compete?\n\n2:02:01.740 --> 2:02:05.700\n And when you went out and were a competitor,\n\n2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:07.780\n how did it work out, right?\n\n2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:10.740\n And the simplicity of that and the purity of that\n\n2:02:10.740 --> 2:02:15.240\n is something that I always have been drawn to.\n\n2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:18.840\n What about the business of sort of owning a team\n\n2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:22.200\n or putting together a team or trying to like build up a team\n\n2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:23.440\n that's going to be a great team?\n\n2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:25.320\n Like what are some interesting aspects\n\n2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:27.720\n that people might not realize that you can carry over\n\n2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:31.900\n from all the other experience you have in business?\n\n2:02:32.860 --> 2:02:36.200\n I think the hardest thing about professional sports,\n\n2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:39.760\n right now it's individuals getting paid money\n\n2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:42.880\n to play a sport, which is different than,\n\n2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:45.120\n it's certainly different than amateur.\n\n2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:48.440\n And the decisions that are hard\n\n2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:50.600\n is when you get to know somebody\n\n2:02:50.600 --> 2:02:52.120\n who's a player on the team\n\n2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:55.160\n and either they're at the end of their career\n\n2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:57.320\n or you need to go in a different direction\n\n2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:00.840\n and that person who's done everything that you've asked,\n\n2:03:01.760 --> 2:03:03.880\n whatever the coaches have asked of that person\n\n2:03:03.880 --> 2:03:05.920\n and you get close to them.\n\n2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:08.480\n And then when they have to be traded,\n\n2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:12.080\n released or whatever happens, it's, that's sad.\n\n2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:17.080\n And being able to stand back and in some ways\n\n2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:20.960\n be dispassionate and not be a fan, right?\n\n2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:25.860\n There's a, I'm on the baseball hall of fame board\n\n2:03:25.860 --> 2:03:29.620\n and one of the guys that's on the board of me\n\n2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:30.600\n is Jerry Reinsdorf.\n\n2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:32.880\n And I think it was Jerry who said,\n\n2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:35.380\n if you act like a fan, you'll be sitting with them,\n\n2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:37.820\n which I thought was kind of funny.\n\n2:03:37.820 --> 2:03:40.600\n Well, I got to push back on that a little bit\n\n2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:43.740\n as a, by way of a fan asking a dumb question.\n\n2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:49.240\n Okay, let me just give some examples.\n\n2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:51.600\n It's very common in sport.\n\n2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:54.360\n It's funny you said this example of like\n\n2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:57.360\n certain great players going to another team\n\n2:03:57.360 --> 2:03:59.060\n right at the end of their career.\n\n2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:03.000\n And it always makes me sad.\n\n2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:04.360\n It almost makes me want to wish\n\n2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:09.360\n that he kind of retired right there from a perspective\n\n2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:13.720\n of just like, do you ever, as a owner,\n\n2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.720\n but just in that space, think about like the Steelers\n\n2:04:18.720 --> 2:04:21.640\n in the full arc of human history.\n\n2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:23.940\n So not like as a business.\n\n2:04:23.940 --> 2:04:26.200\n I mean, okay, this question might be absurd.\n\n2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:28.640\n I don't have to think about it as a business.\n\n2:04:28.640 --> 2:04:30.500\n You know, I'm a minority owner,\n\n2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:33.080\n so I can think about it almost as a fan,\n\n2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:34.120\n but I'm sorry, go ahead.\n\n2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:35.800\n Yeah, well, that's what I mean.\n\n2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:38.440\n I suppose this is a dumb question to think of,\n\n2:04:40.420 --> 2:04:44.840\n like of a business in that way, not just investment,\n\n2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:49.840\n but like legacy of like what footprint\n\n2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:52.760\n would you leave on this world, on this history?\n\n2:04:52.760 --> 2:04:55.960\n That is one thing that I can say unequivocally,\n\n2:04:55.960 --> 2:04:59.400\n and I only have the experience that I have.\n\n2:04:59.400 --> 2:05:02.440\n But one of the things that I'm so proud of\n\n2:05:02.440 --> 2:05:07.440\n about the way the Steelers conduct themselves is,\n\n2:05:07.700 --> 2:05:08.940\n and that's the Rooney family,\n\n2:05:08.940 --> 2:05:10.620\n that's the legacy of the Rooney family,\n\n2:05:10.620 --> 2:05:13.500\n is asking constantly about what's right for the league,\n\n2:05:13.500 --> 2:05:14.960\n what's right for the players,\n\n2:05:17.100 --> 2:05:19.060\n what's the right thing to do here?\n\n2:05:19.060 --> 2:05:22.200\n And that's something that I would hear Mr. Rooney say\n\n2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:23.040\n all the time.\n\n2:05:23.040 --> 2:05:25.440\n So I think that legacy is important\n\n2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:29.640\n because ultimately the team belongs to that city, right?\n\n2:05:29.640 --> 2:05:33.140\n Belongs to those fans and the owners\n\n2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:35.380\n are the custodians of that.\n\n2:05:35.380 --> 2:05:40.380\n So I think, and when you realize what sports teams mean\n\n2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:43.580\n to the fans, the memories that it creates,\n\n2:05:43.580 --> 2:05:47.660\n the bonds that it creates, it's a responsibility.\n\n2:05:50.340 --> 2:05:54.140\n And I think that you do have to think beyond the,\n\n2:05:55.020 --> 2:05:57.180\n certainly not just dollars and cents,\n\n2:05:57.180 --> 2:06:02.180\n but just sports is a very big deal in our society.\n\n2:06:02.980 --> 2:06:06.740\n And it has to be, I think, held to a standard\n\n2:06:08.300 --> 2:06:12.460\n that's not just, well, were we profitable this year?\n\n2:06:12.460 --> 2:06:14.840\n That's, there are other businesses for that.\n\n2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:16.240\n It is certainly a business.\n\n2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:19.220\n I don't mean to romanticize to the point that it's not,\n\n2:06:19.220 --> 2:06:22.260\n but to me, it's more than that.\n\n2:06:22.260 --> 2:06:24.820\n Or at least my experience has been that it's more than that.\n\n2:06:24.820 --> 2:06:28.060\n It's a source of meaning for millions of people.\n\n2:06:28.060 --> 2:06:32.140\n And you see that most, like during COVID, for example,\n\n2:06:32.140 --> 2:06:33.740\n when there's so much desperation,\n\n2:06:33.740 --> 2:06:35.500\n so many people losing their jobs,\n\n2:06:35.500 --> 2:06:37.300\n so many people having to deal with the uncertainty\n\n2:06:37.300 --> 2:06:38.980\n of what the future holds.\n\n2:06:38.980 --> 2:06:42.140\n There's something about those sports that just unites us\n\n2:06:42.140 --> 2:06:47.140\n that again, the tragedy and the triumphs of sport,\n\n2:06:47.500 --> 2:06:50.780\n of united, of gathering together with your friends,\n\n2:06:50.780 --> 2:06:54.100\n with family, shared experience of over like this,\n\n2:06:54.100 --> 2:06:58.180\n yeah, over just team, over rooting for your team,\n\n2:06:58.180 --> 2:06:59.940\n for your city ultimately.\n\n2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:03.260\n And the access, again, as I alluded to,\n\n2:07:03.260 --> 2:07:05.300\n we didn't have anything when I was growing up,\n\n2:07:05.300 --> 2:07:07.780\n but I would pour through the box scores.\n\n2:07:07.780 --> 2:07:10.340\n I was a huge Yankee fan and Steeler fan\n\n2:07:10.340 --> 2:07:13.700\n and feeling some ownership of that, right?\n\n2:07:13.700 --> 2:07:16.300\n That I could read the box score and relive what they did\n\n2:07:16.300 --> 2:07:18.880\n and occasionally see them on TV\n\n2:07:18.880 --> 2:07:22.500\n and feel like I was part of that celebration\n\n2:07:22.500 --> 2:07:24.180\n when they won and everything.\n\n2:07:24.180 --> 2:07:26.180\n It's a very powerful thing.\n\n2:07:27.500 --> 2:07:30.580\n You've been exceptionally successful in a bunch of avenues\n\n2:07:30.580 --> 2:07:31.980\n and a bunch of efforts.\n\n2:07:31.980 --> 2:07:34.740\n What advice would you give to a young person today,\n\n2:07:34.740 --> 2:07:38.220\n a high school student, a college undergraduate\n\n2:07:38.220 --> 2:07:43.220\n that's thinking about career, maybe advice,\n\n2:07:43.620 --> 2:07:46.740\n not about just career, but about how to live a life\n\n2:07:46.740 --> 2:07:48.020\n they can be proud of?\n\n2:07:49.140 --> 2:07:51.740\n You know, we talked earlier about intellectual honesty\n\n2:07:51.740 --> 2:07:55.100\n and to me, that's the first step of just saying\n\n2:07:55.100 --> 2:07:57.980\n to the best of your ability, who am I?\n\n2:07:57.980 --> 2:07:59.940\n And what's important to me\n\n2:07:59.940 --> 2:08:01.960\n and what do I wanna do and accomplish?\n\n2:08:03.020 --> 2:08:05.060\n If you can start with that\n\n2:08:05.060 --> 2:08:10.020\n and develop some sort of rules based philosophical,\n\n2:08:10.020 --> 2:08:14.060\n here's what I'll do, what I won't do.\n\n2:08:14.060 --> 2:08:18.200\n And that way you can be flexible and pliable\n\n2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:19.180\n and you're gonna need to be,\n\n2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:24.180\n but if you still have a compass that tells you,\n\n2:08:25.140 --> 2:08:28.300\n hey, at least I know this is the path I'm gonna take,\n\n2:08:28.300 --> 2:08:29.940\n I think that's very important.\n\n2:08:29.940 --> 2:08:33.020\n The rules you're referring to, the principles,\n\n2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:35.780\n that's kind of like underlying integrity.\n\n2:08:35.780 --> 2:08:39.020\n So knowing what lines you don't cross on this path.\n\n2:08:39.020 --> 2:08:42.780\n Exactly right, because if you have those absolutes,\n\n2:08:42.780 --> 2:08:46.540\n there are many decisions that come into focus very quickly\n\n2:08:46.540 --> 2:08:49.820\n because hey, that's not for me, or hey,\n\n2:08:49.820 --> 2:08:53.980\n I'm willing to do whatever it takes to do X, Y, and Z.\n\n2:08:53.980 --> 2:08:56.580\n And it has to do with the thing you were talking about.\n\n2:08:56.580 --> 2:08:58.900\n It's kind of interesting, you mentioned earlier\n\n2:08:58.900 --> 2:09:01.140\n in the conversation about slippery slope\n\n2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:03.360\n and that's how often it happens,\n\n2:09:03.360 --> 2:09:07.800\n like how the slipping into unethical behavior happens.\n\n2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:09.940\n It's a slippery slope of little adjustments,\n\n2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:13.940\n you put stuff off and I found that to be,\n\n2:09:13.940 --> 2:09:18.940\n I've been fortunate to not have to encounter these moments\n\n2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:22.740\n very much in my life, but I still encounter them.\n\n2:09:22.740 --> 2:09:25.340\n That's what integrity I think looks like,\n\n2:09:25.340 --> 2:09:29.080\n is as the slippery slope is happening,\n\n2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:33.260\n those little things is without drama,\n\n2:09:33.260 --> 2:09:35.980\n without making a show of it,\n\n2:09:35.980 --> 2:09:38.620\n making a decision that stands behind your principles\n\n2:09:38.620 --> 2:09:40.340\n and just walking away.\n\n2:09:40.340 --> 2:09:42.920\n Yeah, and besides the big ideas,\n\n2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:46.100\n I'm gonna change the world, I'm gonna innovate,\n\n2:09:46.100 --> 2:09:48.080\n I'm gonna do all those other things,\n\n2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:51.320\n I also start, if I'm giving any advice,\n\n2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:55.820\n which we can debate whether or not I should be giving advice,\n\n2:09:55.820 --> 2:09:59.100\n but just in terms of, well, let me start with this.\n\n2:09:59.100 --> 2:10:01.140\n Are you a good friend?\n\n2:10:01.140 --> 2:10:02.860\n Can you be counted on?\n\n2:10:02.860 --> 2:10:05.260\n Do you do what you say you're going to do?\n\n2:10:05.260 --> 2:10:07.100\n Yeah. Right?\n\n2:10:07.100 --> 2:10:09.740\n Are you accountable to what you sign up for\n\n2:10:09.740 --> 2:10:12.100\n and do you hold others accountable?\n\n2:10:12.100 --> 2:10:13.740\n What does all that look like?\n\n2:10:13.740 --> 2:10:18.740\n And then I think it's being as intellectually curious\n\n2:10:18.820 --> 2:10:20.140\n and well read as you can be.\n\n2:10:20.140 --> 2:10:24.540\n We live in a world that is designed to distract you, right?\n\n2:10:24.540 --> 2:10:27.540\n And being able to sit with your thoughts\n\n2:10:27.540 --> 2:10:30.860\n or go on a walk and think deeply about something\n\n2:10:30.860 --> 2:10:34.660\n and not just surface area, you text me, I text you back\n\n2:10:34.660 --> 2:10:36.620\n and we decide the fate of the world\n\n2:10:36.620 --> 2:10:42.280\n based on a couple of text messages or something.\n\n2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:46.580\n You don't wanna lose touch, I think, with being well read\n\n2:10:46.580 --> 2:10:50.740\n and understanding and standing on great thinkers shoulders\n\n2:10:50.740 --> 2:10:55.340\n and learning from those works.\n\n2:10:55.340 --> 2:11:00.380\n And then I also think that there's resiliency\n\n2:11:00.380 --> 2:11:02.320\n and then there's grit.\n\n2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:04.420\n And I heard someone say one time\n\n2:11:04.420 --> 2:11:06.860\n that those are slightly different.\n\n2:11:06.860 --> 2:11:11.400\n And I'm also, I know that there are all kinds\n\n2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:13.260\n of challenges in life, right?\n\n2:11:13.260 --> 2:11:16.700\n That are tragic, that are unfair.\n\n2:11:16.700 --> 2:11:19.300\n There's no question that's the world we live in.\n\n2:11:19.300 --> 2:11:23.100\n But for me personally, to try as much as possible\n\n2:11:23.100 --> 2:11:26.900\n not to be in the victim mindset\n\n2:11:26.900 --> 2:11:30.700\n because unfair things are gonna happen.\n\n2:11:30.700 --> 2:11:36.500\n And we all wanna live in an idealistic, just world.\n\n2:11:36.500 --> 2:11:38.800\n That should be what we aspire to.\n\n2:11:40.060 --> 2:11:43.020\n I haven't seen that yet, I haven't experienced that yet,\n\n2:11:43.020 --> 2:11:47.140\n but yet you still have to function in that world.\n\n2:11:47.140 --> 2:11:52.140\n So I think that that resiliency thing is very important.\n\n2:11:52.740 --> 2:11:56.900\n And then putting yourself out there, right?\n\n2:11:56.900 --> 2:12:01.380\n Because if you play scared and you're always afraid to fail,\n\n2:12:01.380 --> 2:12:03.780\n you know, this is probably a dumb way\n\n2:12:03.780 --> 2:12:05.160\n to get to the end of the podcast,\n\n2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:08.700\n but there are times, especially I'm out West,\n\n2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:13.700\n I love the big sky out in Montana, Idaho, places like that.\n\n2:12:13.700 --> 2:12:16.100\n And when you look up at night, it's almost like\n\n2:12:16.100 --> 2:12:18.300\n I've never seen anything like this before\n\n2:12:18.300 --> 2:12:21.240\n because there's no light pollution, so to speak.\n\n2:12:22.500 --> 2:12:23.940\n And sometimes when I look up,\n\n2:12:23.940 --> 2:12:26.180\n the most daunting problems that I'm experiencing,\n\n2:12:26.180 --> 2:12:29.620\n I'm like, those things have been there\n\n2:12:29.620 --> 2:12:31.540\n for a billion years or whatever,\n\n2:12:31.540 --> 2:12:34.220\n and I'll be gone and it doesn't,\n\n2:12:35.340 --> 2:12:40.340\n the most famous person on earth 200 years ago, eh.\n\n2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:43.820\n So it's pretty fleeting.\n\n2:12:44.740 --> 2:12:48.020\n And so make sure you have a good journey\n\n2:12:48.020 --> 2:12:50.500\n and especially coming out of COVID,\n\n2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:53.700\n I think telling people that you care about them\n\n2:12:53.700 --> 2:12:56.940\n and maintaining and cultivating your friendships\n\n2:12:56.940 --> 2:13:00.740\n and relationships and they're not just transactional, right?\n\n2:13:00.740 --> 2:13:04.760\n And making sure that someday when you're laying there,\n\n2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:07.020\n you can say, yeah, I was a good family member.\n\n2:13:07.020 --> 2:13:10.180\n I was a good friend.\n\n2:13:10.180 --> 2:13:11.980\n I was someone that could be counted on.\n\n2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:15.740\n I think all those things go into the mix of, you know,\n\n2:13:15.740 --> 2:13:17.500\n however you wanna take the journey.\n\n2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:19.020\n So when you look up to the stars,\n\n2:13:19.020 --> 2:13:23.100\n do you think about that quickly approaching end of yours?\n\n2:13:23.100 --> 2:13:24.580\n Do you think about your own mortality?\n\n2:13:24.580 --> 2:13:26.100\n Do you think about your death?\n\n2:13:26.100 --> 2:13:27.860\n Are you afraid of your death?\n\n2:13:27.860 --> 2:13:30.420\n I'm a huge fan of stoicism, right?\n\n2:13:30.420 --> 2:13:32.620\n I read a lot of stoicism.\n\n2:13:34.060 --> 2:13:35.900\n I think Ryan Holiday's done a great job\n\n2:13:35.900 --> 2:13:38.940\n of bringing some of that back into the forefront.\n\n2:13:38.940 --> 2:13:43.420\n It's just really thought provoking to me\n\n2:13:43.420 --> 2:13:45.740\n and rings, a lot of it rings, just hits me\n\n2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:47.700\n and says, I think that's right.\n\n2:13:47.700 --> 2:13:51.700\n And that Momento Mori thing, which is,\n\n2:13:51.700 --> 2:13:55.300\n hey, we're all gonna die, so you should contemplate it.\n\n2:13:56.220 --> 2:13:58.720\n There's a finality to this thing.\n\n2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:03.060\n And so I think if you can rightly frame that\n\n2:14:03.060 --> 2:14:07.360\n between fretting about it every day and being afraid\n\n2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:09.660\n and being so laissez faire that you think, you know,\n\n2:14:09.660 --> 2:14:12.060\n you're gonna live forever,\n\n2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:15.920\n it'll influence some of the decisions you make.\n\n2:14:15.920 --> 2:14:19.140\n It'll influence the way you attack things\n\n2:14:19.140 --> 2:14:23.420\n and hopefully the way that you live your life.\n\n2:14:23.420 --> 2:14:28.180\n So yes, I wouldn't say I obsess over it\n\n2:14:28.180 --> 2:14:30.400\n and I wouldn't say it's omnipresent,\n\n2:14:31.700 --> 2:14:33.780\n but because I read a lot of stoicism\n\n2:14:33.780 --> 2:14:36.940\n and just, I think it's right to pause and say,\n\n2:14:37.780 --> 2:14:38.740\n who knows, right?\n\n2:14:38.740 --> 2:14:41.300\n There's gonna be an expiration date.\n\n2:14:42.340 --> 2:14:43.940\n And if it happened tomorrow,\n\n2:14:43.940 --> 2:14:46.700\n have I done the things I wanted to do?\n\n2:14:46.700 --> 2:14:50.120\n And am I the person I wanted to be?\n\n2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:52.100\n And I think it's important along the way\n\n2:14:52.100 --> 2:14:53.860\n to check those things.\n\n2:14:53.860 --> 2:14:58.460\n Yeah, I try to make sure that I actually visualize this,\n\n2:14:58.460 --> 2:15:01.340\n that I'm okay dying at the end of the day,\n\n2:15:01.340 --> 2:15:03.100\n at the end of each day.\n\n2:15:03.100 --> 2:15:05.500\n Like, if this is the last thing I do in my life\n\n2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:07.760\n is talking to you.\n\n2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:08.700\n Oh, good Lord.\n\n2:15:11.260 --> 2:15:12.860\n I'm happy.\n\n2:15:12.860 --> 2:15:15.140\n I know you're joking, but I, you know,\n\n2:15:15.140 --> 2:15:19.620\n that, yeah, I'm happy I get to live the life I do\n\n2:15:19.620 --> 2:15:20.740\n and I think momentum more,\n\n2:15:20.740 --> 2:15:23.140\n I think the stoics have it right.\n\n2:15:23.140 --> 2:15:26.380\n So you, and you have it right in saying,\n\n2:15:26.380 --> 2:15:28.940\n meditate on death enough to remember\n\n2:15:28.940 --> 2:15:31.500\n that this ride ends pretty quickly,\n\n2:15:31.500 --> 2:15:34.340\n to help you appreciate every day\n\n2:15:34.340 --> 2:15:36.500\n and the people you love, the people close to you\n\n2:15:36.500 --> 2:15:39.280\n and the cool shit that you're doing in your life,\n\n2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:40.860\n the cool shit you're creating.\n\n2:15:40.860 --> 2:15:44.180\n And the fact that you, Mr. Thomas Tall,\n\n2:15:44.180 --> 2:15:48.620\n are playing with the motherfucking Rolling Stones tomorrow.\n\n2:15:48.620 --> 2:15:50.700\n You are the man in so many disciplines,\n\n2:15:50.700 --> 2:15:52.940\n so respected, so successful.\n\n2:15:52.940 --> 2:15:55.220\n It's truly an honor that you sit down\n\n2:15:55.220 --> 2:15:56.460\n and talk with me today.\n\n2:15:56.460 --> 2:15:59.780\n Thomas, thank you so much for showing up in Texas\n\n2:15:59.780 --> 2:16:01.940\n and for talking on this silly little podcast.\n\n2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:02.800\n Oh, it's great, man.\n\n2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:04.300\n I'm a huge fan of the show\n\n2:16:04.300 --> 2:16:06.700\n and have had a great time hanging with you\n\n2:16:06.700 --> 2:16:09.260\n and really appreciate it.\n\n2:16:09.260 --> 2:16:12.000\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Thomas Tall.\n\n2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.740\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n2:16:14.740 --> 2:16:16.100\n in the description.\n\n2:16:16.100 --> 2:16:18.320\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:21.320\n from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones.\n\n2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:23.500\n You can't always get what you want,\n\n2:16:23.500 --> 2:16:25.000\n but if you try sometimes,\n\n2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.460\n you might find you'll get what you need.\n\n2:16:27.460 --> 2:16:42.460\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
