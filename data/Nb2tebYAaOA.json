has worked at AMD, Apple, Tesla, and now Intel.\n\n00:10.160 --> 00:13.520\n He's known for his work on AMD K7, K8, K12,\n\n00:13.520 --> 00:18.120\n and Zen microarchitectures, Apple A4 and A5 processors,\n\n00:18.120 --> 00:20.080\n and coauthor of the specification\n\n00:20.080 --> 00:23.040\n for the x8664 instruction set\n\n00:23.040 --> 00:26.120\n and hypertransport interconnect.\n\n00:26.120 --> 00:28.440\n He's a brilliant first principles engineer\n\n00:28.440 --> 00:30.040\n and out of the box thinker,\n\n00:30.040 --> 00:33.480\n and just an interesting and fun human being to talk to.\n\n00:33.480 --> 00:36.480\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:36.480 --> 00:38.860\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:38.860 --> 00:40.840\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n00:40.840 --> 00:43.500\n follow on Spotify, support it on Patreon,\n\n00:43.500 --> 00:45.600\n or simply connect with me on Twitter,\n\n00:45.600 --> 00:49.560\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n00:49.560 --> 00:51.040\n I recently started doing ads\n\n00:51.040 --> 00:52.600\n at the end of the introduction.\n\n00:52.600 --> 00:55.560\n I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode\n\n00:55.560 --> 00:57.100\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n00:57.100 --> 00:59.400\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n00:59.400 --> 01:00.780\n I hope that works for you\n\n01:00.780 --> 01:04.040\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n01:04.040 --> 01:06.160\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:06.160 --> 01:08.640\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:08.640 --> 01:11.440\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n01:11.440 --> 01:13.200\n but you can also use it to buy, sell,\n\n01:13.200 --> 01:15.600\n and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.\n\n01:15.600 --> 01:18.480\n Cash App also has a new investing feature.\n\n01:18.480 --> 01:21.440\n You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,\n\n01:21.440 --> 01:23.540\n no matter what the stock price is.\n\n01:23.540 --> 01:26.480\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n01:26.480 --> 01:29.740\n a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.\n\n01:29.740 --> 01:32.040\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n01:32.040 --> 01:35.440\n to support one of my favorite organizations called First,\n\n01:35.440 --> 01:38.960\n best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.\n\n01:38.960 --> 01:42.240\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n01:42.240 --> 01:45.360\n in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating\n\n01:45.360 --> 01:46.720\n at Charity Navigator,\n\n01:46.720 --> 01:48.000\n which means that donated money\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.760\n is used to maximum effectiveness.\n\n01:50.760 --> 01:53.480\n When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play\n\n01:53.480 --> 01:56.280\n and use code LEXPODCAST,\n\n01:56.280 --> 02:00.280\n you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n02:00.280 --> 02:02.120\n which again is an organization\n\n02:02.120 --> 02:04.920\n that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys\n\n02:04.920 --> 02:08.060\n to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n02:08.060 --> 02:11.460\n And now here's my conversation with Jim Keller.\n\n02:12.560 --> 02:14.520\n What are the differences and similarities\n\n02:14.520 --> 02:17.200\n between the human brain and a computer\n\n02:17.200 --> 02:19.260\n with the microprocessor at its core?\n\n02:19.260 --> 02:22.260\n Let's start with the philosophical question perhaps.\n\n02:22.260 --> 02:25.400\n Well, since people don't actually understand\n\n02:25.400 --> 02:29.200\n how human brains work, I think that's true.\n\n02:29.200 --> 02:30.560\n I think that's true.\n\n02:30.560 --> 02:32.600\n So it's hard to compare them.\n\n02:32.600 --> 02:37.260\n Computers are, you know, there's really two things.\n\n02:37.260 --> 02:40.480\n There's memory and there's computation, right?\n\n02:40.480 --> 02:43.920\n And to date, almost all computer architectures\n\n02:43.920 --> 02:47.600\n are global memory, which is a thing, right?\n\n02:47.600 --> 02:49.360\n And then computation where you pull data\n\n02:49.360 --> 02:52.440\n and you do relatively simple operations on it\n\n02:52.440 --> 02:53.900\n and write data back.\n\n02:53.900 --> 02:57.760\n So it's decoupled in modern computers.\n\n02:57.760 --> 02:59.840\n And you think in the human brain,\n\n02:59.840 --> 03:02.600\n everything's a mesh, a mess that's combined together?\n\n03:02.600 --> 03:04.840\n What people observe is there's, you know,\n\n03:04.840 --> 03:06.500\n some number of layers of neurons\n\n03:06.500 --> 03:09.120\n which have local and global connections\n\n03:09.120 --> 03:12.840\n and information is stored in some distributed fashion\n\n03:13.700 --> 03:18.280\n and people build things called neural networks in computers\n\n03:18.280 --> 03:21.200\n where the information is distributed\n\n03:21.200 --> 03:22.840\n in some kind of fashion.\n\n03:22.840 --> 03:25.520\n You know, there's a mathematics behind it.\n\n03:25.520 --> 03:29.220\n I don't know that the understanding of that is super deep.\n\n03:29.220 --> 03:31.160\n The computations we run on those\n\n03:31.160 --> 03:33.440\n are straightforward computations.\n\n03:33.440 --> 03:35.520\n I don't believe anybody has said\n\n03:35.520 --> 03:37.880\n a neuron does this computation.\n\n03:37.880 --> 03:42.880\n So to date, it's hard to compare them, I would say.\n\n03:44.120 --> 03:48.800\n So let's get into the basics before we zoom back out.\n\n03:48.800 --> 03:51.020\n How do you build a computer from scratch?\n\n03:51.020 --> 03:52.760\n What is a microprocessor?\n\n03:52.760 --> 03:54.120\n What is a microarchitecture?\n\n03:54.120 --> 03:56.640\n What's an instruction set architecture?\n\n03:56.640 --> 03:59.460\n Maybe even as far back as what is a transistor?\n\n04:01.040 --> 04:05.040\n So the special charm of computer engineering\n\n04:05.040 --> 04:08.400\n is there's a relatively good understanding\n\n04:08.400 --> 04:10.480\n of abstraction layers.\n\n04:10.480 --> 04:12.280\n So down at the bottom, you have atoms\n\n04:12.280 --> 04:15.480\n and atoms get put together in materials like silicon\n\n04:15.480 --> 04:19.440\n or dope silicon or metal and we build transistors.\n\n04:19.440 --> 04:23.680\n On top of that, we build logic gates, right?\n\n04:23.680 --> 04:27.360\n And then functional units, like an adder or a subtractor\n\n04:27.360 --> 04:28.800\n or an instruction parsing unit.\n\n04:28.800 --> 04:32.320\n And then we assemble those into processing elements.\n\n04:32.320 --> 04:37.240\n Modern computers are built out of probably 10 to 20\n\n04:37.240 --> 04:40.960\n locally organic processing elements\n\n04:40.960 --> 04:42.640\n or coherent processing elements.\n\n04:42.640 --> 04:46.640\n And then that runs computer programs, right?\n\n04:46.640 --> 04:49.800\n So there's abstraction layers and then software,\n\n04:49.800 --> 04:51.760\n there's an instruction set you run\n\n04:51.760 --> 04:56.440\n and then there's assembly language C, C++, Java, JavaScript.\n\n04:56.440 --> 04:58.680\n There's abstraction layers,\n\n04:58.680 --> 05:02.520\n essentially from the atom to the data center, right?\n\n05:02.520 --> 05:05.100\n So when you build a computer,\n\n05:06.760 --> 05:08.560\n first there's a target, like what's it for?\n\n05:08.560 --> 05:09.960\n Like how fast does it have to be?\n\n05:09.960 --> 05:12.200\n Which today there's a whole bunch of metrics\n\n05:12.200 --> 05:13.840\n about what that is.\n\n05:13.840 --> 05:17.040\n And then in an organization of 1,000 people\n\n05:17.040 --> 05:22.040\n who build a computer, there's lots of different disciplines\n\n05:22.240 --> 05:24.120\n that you have to operate on.\n\n05:24.120 --> 05:25.480\n Does that make sense?\n\n05:25.480 --> 05:27.120\n And so...\n\n05:27.120 --> 05:29.280\n So there's a bunch of levels of abstraction\n\n05:30.780 --> 05:35.720\n in an organization like Intel and in your own vision,\n\n05:35.720 --> 05:37.600\n there's a lot of brilliance that comes in\n\n05:37.600 --> 05:39.700\n at every one of those layers.\n\n05:39.700 --> 05:41.680\n Some of it is science, some of it is engineering,\n\n05:41.680 --> 05:45.440\n some of it is art, what's the most,\n\n05:45.440 --> 05:46.380\n if you could pick favorites,\n\n05:46.380 --> 05:49.440\n what's the most important, your favorite layer\n\n05:49.440 --> 05:51.100\n on these layers of abstractions?\n\n05:51.100 --> 05:53.940\n Where does the magic enter this hierarchy?\n\n05:55.360 --> 05:57.120\n I don't really care.\n\n05:57.120 --> 06:00.740\n That's the fun, you know, I'm somewhat agnostic to that.\n\n06:00.740 --> 06:05.520\n So I would say for relatively long periods of time,\n\n06:05.520 --> 06:08.040\n instruction sets are stable.\n\n06:08.040 --> 06:12.000\n So the x86 instruction set, the ARM instruction set.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:13.360\n What's an instruction set?\n\n06:13.360 --> 06:16.120\n So it says, how do you encode the basic operations?\n\n06:16.120 --> 06:20.140\n Load, store, multiply, add, subtract, conditional, branch.\n\n06:20.140 --> 06:23.800\n You know, there aren't that many interesting instructions.\n\n06:23.800 --> 06:26.160\n Look, if you look at a program and it runs,\n\n06:26.160 --> 06:29.840\n you know, 90% of the execution is on 25 opcodes,\n\n06:29.840 --> 06:31.680\n you know, 25 instructions.\n\n06:31.680 --> 06:33.900\n And those are stable, right?\n\n06:33.900 --> 06:35.460\n What does it mean, stable?\n\n06:35.460 --> 06:38.120\n Intel architecture's been around for 25 years.\n\n06:38.120 --> 06:38.960\n It works.\n\n06:38.960 --> 06:39.800\n It works.\n\n06:39.800 --> 06:42.520\n And that's because the basics, you know,\n\n06:42.520 --> 06:45.280\n are defined a long time ago, right?\n\n06:45.280 --> 06:49.480\n Now, the way an old computer ran is you fetched\n\n06:49.480 --> 06:52.960\n instructions and you executed them in order.\n\n06:52.960 --> 06:56.120\n Do the load, do the add, do the compare.\n\n06:57.140 --> 06:59.760\n The way a modern computer works is you fetch\n\n06:59.760 --> 07:03.240\n large numbers of instructions, say 500.\n\n07:03.240 --> 07:06.240\n And then you find the dependency graph\n\n07:06.240 --> 07:07.920\n between the instructions.\n\n07:07.920 --> 07:12.300\n And then you execute in independent units\n\n07:12.300 --> 07:14.420\n those little micrographs.\n\n07:15.280 --> 07:17.760\n So a modern computer, like people like to say,\n\n07:17.760 --> 07:20.720\n computers should be simple and clean.\n\n07:20.720 --> 07:22.400\n But it turns out the market for simple,\n\n07:22.400 --> 07:26.240\n clean, slow computers is zero, right?\n\n07:26.240 --> 07:29.560\n We don't sell any simple, clean computers.\n\n07:29.560 --> 07:33.560\n No, you can, how you build it can be clean,\n\n07:33.560 --> 07:36.680\n but the computer people want to buy,\n\n07:36.680 --> 07:40.440\n that's, say, in a phone or a data center,\n\n07:40.440 --> 07:42.680\n fetches a large number of instructions,\n\n07:42.680 --> 07:45.600\n computes the dependency graph,\n\n07:45.600 --> 07:49.160\n and then executes it in a way that gets the right answers.\n\n07:49.160 --> 07:50.880\n And optimizes that graph somehow.\n\n07:50.880 --> 07:53.520\n Yeah, they run deeply out of order.\n\n07:53.520 --> 07:57.580\n And then there's semantics around how memory ordering works\n\n07:57.580 --> 07:58.420\n and other things work.\n\n07:58.420 --> 08:01.960\n So the computer sort of has a bunch of bookkeeping tables\n\n08:01.960 --> 08:05.520\n that says what order should these operations finish in\n\n08:05.520 --> 08:07.800\n or appear to finish in?\n\n08:07.800 --> 08:10.720\n But to go fast, you have to fetch a lot of instructions\n\n08:10.720 --> 08:12.720\n and find all the parallelism.\n\n08:12.720 --> 08:15.480\n Now, there's a second kind of computer,\n\n08:15.480 --> 08:17.560\n which we call GPUs today.\n\n08:17.560 --> 08:19.640\n And I call it the difference.\n\n08:19.640 --> 08:21.880\n There's found parallelism, like you have a program\n\n08:21.880 --> 08:24.120\n with a lot of dependent instructions.\n\n08:24.120 --> 08:26.120\n You fetch a bunch and then you go figure out\n\n08:26.120 --> 08:29.400\n the dependency graph and you issue instructions out of order.\n\n08:29.400 --> 08:32.960\n That's because you have one serial narrative to execute,\n\n08:32.960 --> 08:35.840\n which, in fact, can be done out of order.\n\n08:35.840 --> 08:37.080\n Did you call it a narrative?\n\n08:37.080 --> 08:37.920\n Yeah.\n\n08:37.920 --> 08:38.760\n Oh, wow.\n\n08:38.760 --> 08:40.700\n Yeah, so humans think of serial narrative.\n\n08:40.700 --> 08:42.960\n So read a book, right?\n\n08:42.960 --> 08:45.760\n There's a sentence after sentence after sentence,\n\n08:45.760 --> 08:46.840\n and there's paragraphs.\n\n08:46.840 --> 08:49.360\n Now, you could diagram that.\n\n08:49.360 --> 08:51.820\n Imagine you diagrammed it properly and you said,\n\n08:52.680 --> 08:55.640\n which sentences could be read in any order,\n\n08:55.640 --> 08:59.060\n any order without changing the meaning, right?\n\n08:59.960 --> 09:02.520\n That's a fascinating question to ask of a book, yeah.\n\n09:02.520 --> 09:04.400\n Yeah, you could do that, right?\n\n09:04.400 --> 09:06.280\n So some paragraphs could be reordered,\n\n09:06.280 --> 09:08.400\n some sentences can be reordered.\n\n09:08.400 --> 09:13.400\n You could say, he is tall and smart and X, right?\n\n09:15.640 --> 09:18.220\n And it doesn't matter the order of tall and smart.\n\n09:19.840 --> 09:22.920\n But if you say the tall man is wearing a red shirt,\n\n09:22.920 --> 09:27.920\n what colors, you can create dependencies, right?\n\n09:28.440 --> 09:32.000\n And so GPUs, on the other hand,\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.320\n run simple programs on pixels,\n\n09:35.320 --> 09:36.880\n but you're given a million of them.\n\n09:36.880 --> 09:40.160\n And the first order, the screen you're looking at\n\n09:40.160 --> 09:42.200\n doesn't care which order you do it in.\n\n09:42.200 --> 09:44.480\n So I call that given parallelism.\n\n09:44.480 --> 09:48.280\n Simple narratives around the large numbers of things\n\n09:48.280 --> 09:49.400\n where you can just say,\n\n09:49.400 --> 09:52.320\n it's parallel because you told me it was.\n\n09:52.320 --> 09:57.320\n So found parallelism where the narrative is sequential,\n\n09:57.680 --> 10:01.800\n but you discover like little pockets of parallelism versus.\n\n10:01.800 --> 10:03.980\n Turns out large pockets of parallelism.\n\n10:03.980 --> 10:05.880\n Large, so how hard is it to discover?\n\n10:05.880 --> 10:06.960\n Well, how hard is it?\n\n10:06.960 --> 10:08.800\n That's just transistor count, right?\n\n10:08.800 --> 10:11.160\n So once you crack the problem, you say,\n\n10:11.160 --> 10:13.440\n here's how you fetch 10 instructions at a time.\n\n10:13.440 --> 10:16.360\n Here's how you calculate the dependencies between them.\n\n10:16.360 --> 10:18.480\n Here's how you describe the dependencies.\n\n10:18.480 --> 10:20.660\n Here's, you know, these are pieces, right?\n\n10:20.660 --> 10:25.580\n So once you describe the dependencies,\n\n10:25.580 --> 10:27.580\n then it's just a graph.\n\n10:27.580 --> 10:30.180\n Sort of, it's an algorithm that finds,\n\n10:31.140 --> 10:31.960\n what is that?\n\n10:31.960 --> 10:34.620\n I'm sure there's a graph theoretical answer here\n\n10:34.620 --> 10:35.860\n that's solvable.\n\n10:35.860 --> 10:40.700\n In general, programs, modern programs\n\n10:40.700 --> 10:42.220\n that human beings write,\n\n10:42.220 --> 10:45.820\n how much found parallelism is there in them?\n\n10:45.820 --> 10:47.260\n What does 10X mean?\n\n10:47.260 --> 10:52.180\n So if you execute it in order, you would get\n\n10:52.180 --> 10:53.940\n what's called cycles per instruction,\n\n10:53.940 --> 10:57.140\n and it would be about, you know,\n\n10:57.140 --> 11:00.020\n three instructions, three cycles per instruction\n\n11:00.020 --> 11:02.780\n because of the latency of the operations and stuff.\n\n11:02.780 --> 11:05.220\n And in a modern computer, excuse it,\n\n11:05.220 --> 11:08.700\n but like 0.2, 0.25 cycles per instruction.\n\n11:08.700 --> 11:11.820\n So it's about, we today find 10X.\n\n11:11.820 --> 11:13.020\n And there's two things.\n\n11:13.020 --> 11:17.380\n One is the found parallelism in the narrative, right?\n\n11:17.380 --> 11:21.380\n And the other is the predictability of the narrative, right?\n\n11:21.380 --> 11:25.540\n So certain operations say, do a bunch of calculations,\n\n11:25.540 --> 11:28.900\n and if greater than one, do this, else do that.\n\n11:30.380 --> 11:33.180\n That decision is predicted in modern computers\n\n11:33.180 --> 11:36.220\n to high 90% accuracy.\n\n11:36.220 --> 11:38.740\n So branches happen a lot.\n\n11:38.740 --> 11:40.420\n So imagine you have a decision\n\n11:40.420 --> 11:41.780\n to make every six instructions,\n\n11:41.780 --> 11:43.740\n which is about the average, right?\n\n11:43.740 --> 11:45.440\n But you want to fetch 500 instructions,\n\n11:45.440 --> 11:48.420\n figure out the graph, and execute them all in parallel.\n\n11:48.420 --> 11:51.580\n That means you have, let's say,\n\n11:51.580 --> 11:54.980\n if you fetch 600 instructions and it's every six,\n\n11:54.980 --> 11:56.940\n you have to fetch, you have to predict\n\n11:56.940 --> 11:59.380\n 99 out of 100 branches correctly\n\n12:00.260 --> 12:02.340\n for that window to be effective.\n\n12:02.340 --> 12:06.860\n Okay, so parallelism, you can't parallelize branches.\n\n12:06.860 --> 12:07.700\n Or you can.\n\n12:07.700 --> 12:08.660\n No, you can predict.\n\n12:08.660 --> 12:09.500\n You can predict.\n\n12:09.500 --> 12:10.580\n What does predicted branch mean?\n\n12:10.580 --> 12:11.420\n What does predicted branch mean?\n\n12:11.420 --> 12:13.580\n So imagine you do a computation over and over.\n\n12:13.580 --> 12:14.940\n You're in a loop.\n\n12:14.940 --> 12:19.420\n So while n is greater than one, do.\n\n12:19.420 --> 12:21.220\n And you go through that loop a million times.\n\n12:21.220 --> 12:22.660\n So every time you look at the branch,\n\n12:22.660 --> 12:25.740\n you say, it's probably still greater than one.\n\n12:25.740 --> 12:27.820\n And you're saying you could do that accurately.\n\n12:27.820 --> 12:28.660\n Very accurately.\n\n12:28.660 --> 12:29.500\n Modern computers.\n\n12:29.500 --> 12:30.500\n My mind is blown.\n\n12:30.500 --> 12:31.460\n How the heck do you do that?\n\n12:31.460 --> 12:32.620\n Wait a minute.\n\n12:32.620 --> 12:33.820\n Well, you want to know?\n\n12:33.820 --> 12:35.500\n This is really sad.\n\n12:35.500 --> 12:38.700\n 20 years ago, you simply recorded\n\n12:38.700 --> 12:40.620\n which way the branch went last time\n\n12:40.620 --> 12:42.780\n and predicted the same thing.\n\n12:42.780 --> 12:43.620\n Right.\n\n12:43.620 --> 12:44.460\n Okay.\n\n12:44.460 --> 12:46.140\n What's the accuracy of that?\n\n12:46.140 --> 12:48.100\n 85%.\n\n12:48.100 --> 12:51.780\n So then somebody said, hey, let's keep a couple of bits\n\n12:51.780 --> 12:54.980\n and have a little counter so when it predicts one way,\n\n12:54.980 --> 12:56.740\n we count up and then pins.\n\n12:56.740 --> 12:58.060\n So say you have a three bit counter.\n\n12:58.060 --> 13:00.740\n So you count up and then you count down.\n\n13:00.740 --> 13:03.260\n And you can use the top bit as the signed bit\n\n13:03.260 --> 13:05.020\n so you have a signed two bit number.\n\n13:05.020 --> 13:07.500\n So if it's greater than one, you predict taken.\n\n13:07.500 --> 13:11.460\n And less than one, you predict not taken, right?\n\n13:11.460 --> 13:14.100\n Or less than zero, whatever the thing is.\n\n13:14.100 --> 13:16.140\n And that got us to 92%.\n\n13:16.140 --> 13:17.300\n Oh.\n\n13:17.300 --> 13:19.540\n Okay, no, it gets better.\n\n13:19.540 --> 13:22.900\n This branch depends on how you got there.\n\n13:22.900 --> 13:25.540\n So if you came down the code one way,\n\n13:25.540 --> 13:28.420\n you're talking about Bob and Jane, right?\n\n13:28.420 --> 13:30.460\n And then said, does Bob like Jane?\n\n13:30.460 --> 13:31.300\n It went one way.\n\n13:31.300 --> 13:32.900\n But if you're talking about Bob and Jill,\n\n13:32.900 --> 13:33.940\n does Bob like Jane?\n\n13:33.940 --> 13:35.540\n You go a different way.\n\n13:35.540 --> 13:36.940\n Right, so that's called history.\n\n13:36.940 --> 13:38.940\n So you take the history and a counter.\n\n13:40.020 --> 13:43.420\n That's cool, but that's not how anything works today.\n\n13:43.420 --> 13:46.420\n They use something that looks a little like a neural network.\n\n13:48.060 --> 13:51.340\n So modern, you take all the execution flows.\n\n13:52.260 --> 13:56.140\n And then you do basically deep pattern recognition\n\n13:56.140 --> 13:58.540\n of how the program is executing.\n\n13:59.940 --> 14:03.740\n And you do that multiple different ways.\n\n14:03.740 --> 14:07.620\n And you have something that chooses what the best result is.\n\n14:07.620 --> 14:10.460\n There's a little supercomputer inside the computer.\n\n14:10.460 --> 14:11.860\n That's trying to predict branching.\n\n14:11.860 --> 14:14.340\n That calculates which way branches go.\n\n14:14.340 --> 14:17.300\n So the effective window that it's worth finding grass\n\n14:17.300 --> 14:18.340\n in gets bigger.\n\n14:19.260 --> 14:21.860\n Why was that gonna make me sad?\n\n14:21.860 --> 14:22.940\n Because that's amazing.\n\n14:22.940 --> 14:24.420\n It's amazingly complicated.\n\n14:24.420 --> 14:25.260\n Oh, well.\n\n14:25.260 --> 14:27.100\n Well, here's the funny thing.\n\n14:27.100 --> 14:31.740\n So to get to 85% took 1,000 bits.\n\n14:31.740 --> 14:36.740\n To get to 99% takes tens of megabits.\n\n14:38.860 --> 14:42.700\n So this is one of those, to get the result,\n\n14:42.700 --> 14:47.700\n to get from a window of say 50 instructions to 500,\n\n14:47.780 --> 14:49.500\n it took three orders of magnitude\n\n14:49.500 --> 14:51.580\n or four orders of magnitude more bits.\n\n14:52.700 --> 14:55.460\n Now if you get the prediction of a branch wrong,\n\n14:55.460 --> 14:56.300\n what happens then?\n\n14:56.300 --> 14:57.380\n You flush the pipe.\n\n14:57.380 --> 14:59.540\n You flush the pipe, so it's just the performance cost.\n\n14:59.540 --> 15:00.820\n But it gets even better.\n\n15:00.820 --> 15:01.660\n Yeah.\n\n15:01.660 --> 15:03.860\n So we're starting to look at stuff that says,\n\n15:03.860 --> 15:06.700\n so they executed down this path,\n\n15:06.700 --> 15:09.260\n and then you had two ways to go.\n\n15:09.260 --> 15:12.500\n But far away, there's something that doesn't matter\n\n15:12.500 --> 15:13.620\n which path you went.\n\n15:14.660 --> 15:17.660\n So you took the wrong path.\n\n15:17.660 --> 15:19.300\n You executed a bunch of stuff.\n\n15:20.580 --> 15:21.700\n Then you had the mispredicting.\n\n15:21.700 --> 15:22.540\n You backed it up.\n\n15:22.540 --> 15:25.500\n You remembered all the results you already calculated.\n\n15:25.500 --> 15:27.660\n Some of those are just fine.\n\n15:27.660 --> 15:30.260\n Like if you read a book and you misunderstand a paragraph,\n\n15:30.260 --> 15:32.500\n your understanding of the next paragraph\n\n15:32.500 --> 15:35.740\n sometimes is invariant to that understanding.\n\n15:35.740 --> 15:37.600\n Sometimes it depends on it.\n\n15:38.540 --> 15:43.260\n And you can kind of anticipate that invariance.\n\n15:43.260 --> 15:47.380\n Yeah, well, you can keep track of whether the data changed.\n\n15:47.380 --> 15:49.220\n And so when you come back through a piece of code,\n\n15:49.220 --> 15:51.860\n should you calculate it again or do the same thing?\n\n15:51.860 --> 15:55.620\n Okay, how much of this is art and how much of it is science?\n\n15:55.620 --> 15:59.100\n Because it sounds pretty complicated.\n\n15:59.100 --> 16:00.660\n Well, how do you describe a situation?\n\n16:00.660 --> 16:02.620\n So imagine you come to a point in the road\n\n16:02.620 --> 16:05.140\n where you have to make a decision, right?\n\n16:05.140 --> 16:07.060\n And you have a bunch of knowledge about which way to go.\n\n16:07.060 --> 16:08.940\n Maybe you have a map.\n\n16:08.940 --> 16:11.580\n So you wanna go the shortest way,\n\n16:11.580 --> 16:13.180\n or do you wanna go the fastest way,\n\n16:13.180 --> 16:14.820\n or do you wanna take the nicest road?\n\n16:14.820 --> 16:17.860\n So there's some set of data.\n\n16:17.860 --> 16:19.660\n So imagine you're doing something complicated\n\n16:19.660 --> 16:21.820\n like building a computer.\n\n16:21.820 --> 16:24.340\n And there's hundreds of decision points,\n\n16:24.340 --> 16:27.760\n all with hundreds of possible ways to go.\n\n16:27.760 --> 16:30.940\n And the ways you pick interact in a complicated way.\n\n16:32.220 --> 16:33.480\n Right.\n\n16:33.480 --> 16:35.700\n And then you have to pick the right spot.\n\n16:35.700 --> 16:36.520\n Right, so that's.\n\n16:36.520 --> 16:37.580\n So that's art or science, I don't know.\n\n16:37.580 --> 16:38.940\n You avoided the question.\n\n16:38.940 --> 16:41.380\n You just described the Robert Frost problem\n\n16:41.380 --> 16:42.620\n of road less taken.\n\n16:43.660 --> 16:45.760\n I described the Robert Frost problem?\n\n16:45.760 --> 16:49.480\n That's what we do as computer designers.\n\n16:49.480 --> 16:50.420\n It's all poetry.\n\n16:50.420 --> 16:51.260\n Okay.\n\n16:51.260 --> 16:52.100\n Great.\n\n16:52.100 --> 16:54.220\n Yeah, I don't know how to describe that\n\n16:54.220 --> 16:56.440\n because some people are very good\n\n16:56.440 --> 16:57.940\n at making those intuitive leaps.\n\n16:57.940 --> 17:00.560\n It seems like just combinations of things.\n\n17:00.560 --> 17:02.180\n Some people are less good at it,\n\n17:02.180 --> 17:05.580\n but they're really good at evaluating the alternatives.\n\n17:05.580 --> 17:09.260\n Right, and everybody has a different way to do it.\n\n17:09.260 --> 17:11.860\n And some people can't make those leaps,\n\n17:11.860 --> 17:14.300\n but they're really good at analyzing it.\n\n17:14.300 --> 17:16.020\n So when you see computers are designed\n\n17:16.020 --> 17:19.260\n by teams of people who have very different skill sets.\n\n17:19.260 --> 17:24.260\n And a good team has lots of different kinds of people.\n\n17:24.460 --> 17:26.260\n I suspect you would describe some of them\n\n17:26.260 --> 17:29.340\n as artistic, but not very many.\n\n17:30.420 --> 17:32.060\n Unfortunately, or fortunately.\n\n17:32.060 --> 17:33.680\n Fortunately.\n\n17:33.680 --> 17:36.460\n Well, you know, computer design's hard.\n\n17:36.460 --> 17:39.460\n It's 99% perspiration.\n\n17:40.380 --> 17:43.300\n And the 1% inspiration is really important.\n\n17:44.140 --> 17:45.860\n But you still need the 99.\n\n17:45.860 --> 17:47.340\n Yeah, you gotta do a lot of work.\n\n17:47.340 --> 17:50.780\n And then there are interesting things to do\n\n17:50.780 --> 17:52.760\n at every level of that stack.\n\n17:52.760 --> 17:55.720\n So at the end of the day,\n\n17:55.720 --> 17:58.880\n if you run the same program multiple times,\n\n17:58.880 --> 18:01.460\n does it always produce the same result?\n\n18:01.460 --> 18:04.720\n Is there some room for fuzziness there?\n\n18:04.720 --> 18:05.840\n That's a math problem.\n\n18:06.720 --> 18:08.560\n So if you run a correct C program,\n\n18:08.560 --> 18:11.480\n the definition is every time you run it,\n\n18:11.480 --> 18:12.480\n you get the same answer.\n\n18:12.480 --> 18:14.480\n Yeah, well that's a math statement.\n\n18:14.480 --> 18:17.440\n But that's a language definitional statement.\n\n18:17.440 --> 18:19.800\n So for years when people did,\n\n18:19.800 --> 18:22.920\n when we first did 3D acceleration of graphics,\n\n18:24.600 --> 18:27.280\n you could run the same scene multiple times\n\n18:27.280 --> 18:28.760\n and get different answers.\n\n18:28.760 --> 18:29.760\n Right.\n\n18:29.760 --> 18:32.360\n Right, and then some people thought that was okay\n\n18:32.360 --> 18:34.560\n and some people thought it was a bad idea.\n\n18:34.560 --> 18:39.240\n And then when the HPC world used GPUs for calculations,\n\n18:39.240 --> 18:41.200\n they thought it was a really bad idea.\n\n18:41.200 --> 18:44.440\n Okay, now in modern AI stuff,\n\n18:44.440 --> 18:48.120\n people are looking at networks\n\n18:48.120 --> 18:51.040\n where the precision of the data is low enough\n\n18:51.040 --> 18:53.640\n that the data is somewhat noisy.\n\n18:53.640 --> 18:57.280\n And the observation is the input data is unbelievably noisy.\n\n18:57.280 --> 19:00.240\n So why should the calculation be not noisy?\n\n19:00.240 --> 19:02.200\n And people have experimented with algorithms\n\n19:02.200 --> 19:05.920\n that say can get faster answers by being noisy.\n\n19:05.920 --> 19:08.240\n Like as a network starts to converge,\n\n19:08.240 --> 19:09.560\n if you look at the computation graph,\n\n19:09.560 --> 19:12.160\n it starts out really wide and then it gets narrower.\n\n19:12.160 --> 19:14.440\n And you can say is that last little bit that important\n\n19:14.440 --> 19:17.680\n or should I start the graph on the next rev\n\n19:17.680 --> 19:21.280\n before we whittle it all the way down to the answer, right?\n\n19:21.280 --> 19:24.040\n So you can create algorithms that are noisy.\n\n19:24.040 --> 19:25.440\n Now if you're developing something\n\n19:25.440 --> 19:27.440\n and every time you run it, you get a different answer,\n\n19:27.440 --> 19:29.280\n it's really annoying.\n\n19:29.280 --> 19:33.920\n And so most people think even today,\n\n19:33.920 --> 19:36.720\n every time you run the program, you get the same answer.\n\n19:36.720 --> 19:38.360\n No, I know, but the question is\n\n19:38.360 --> 19:42.400\n that's the formal definition of a programming language.\n\n19:42.400 --> 19:44.520\n There is a definition of languages\n\n19:44.520 --> 19:45.760\n that don't get the same answer,\n\n19:45.760 --> 19:49.520\n but people who use those, you always want something\n\n19:49.520 --> 19:51.600\n because you get a bad answer and then you're wondering\n\n19:51.600 --> 19:54.440\n is it because of something in the algorithm\n\n19:54.440 --> 19:55.360\n or because of this?\n\n19:55.360 --> 19:57.140\n And so everybody wants a little switch that says\n\n19:57.140 --> 20:00.280\n no matter what, do it deterministically.\n\n20:00.280 --> 20:02.400\n And it's really weird because almost everything\n\n20:02.400 --> 20:05.320\n going into modern calculations is noisy.\n\n20:05.320 --> 20:08.240\n So why do the answers have to be so clear?\n\n20:08.240 --> 20:09.600\n Right, so where do you stand?\n\n20:09.600 --> 20:12.500\n I design computers for people who run programs.\n\n20:12.500 --> 20:16.880\n So if somebody says I want a deterministic answer,\n\n20:16.880 --> 20:18.400\n like most people want that.\n\n20:18.400 --> 20:20.180\n Can you deliver a deterministic answer,\n\n20:20.180 --> 20:21.440\n I guess is the question.\n\n20:21.440 --> 20:22.280\n Like when you.\n\n20:22.280 --> 20:24.040\n Yeah, hopefully, sure.\n\n20:24.040 --> 20:27.280\n What people don't realize is you get a deterministic answer\n\n20:27.280 --> 20:31.100\n even though the execution flow is very undeterministic.\n\n20:31.100 --> 20:33.100\n So you run this program 100 times,\n\n20:33.100 --> 20:36.080\n it never runs the same way twice, ever.\n\n20:36.080 --> 20:37.960\n And the answer, it arrives at the same answer.\n\n20:37.960 --> 20:39.200\n But it gets the same answer every time.\n\n20:39.200 --> 20:42.000\n It's just amazing.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:47.000\n Okay, you've achieved, in the eyes of many people,\n\n20:49.600 --> 20:53.000\n legend status as a chip art architect.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.400\n What design creation are you most proud of?\n\n20:56.400 --> 20:59.440\n Perhaps because it was challenging,\n\n20:59.440 --> 21:01.820\n because of its impact, or because of the set\n\n21:01.820 --> 21:06.820\n of brilliant ideas that were involved in bringing it to life?\n\n21:06.840 --> 21:10.080\n I find that description odd.\n\n21:10.080 --> 21:12.480\n And I have two small children, and I promise you,\n\n21:14.360 --> 21:15.960\n they think it's hilarious.\n\n21:15.960 --> 21:16.800\n This question.\n\n21:16.800 --> 21:17.620\n Yeah.\n\n21:17.620 --> 21:18.460\n I do it for them.\n\n21:18.460 --> 21:22.460\n So I'm really interested in building computers.\n\n21:23.320 --> 21:27.640\n And I've worked with really, really smart people.\n\n21:27.640 --> 21:29.200\n I'm not unbelievably smart.\n\n21:30.040 --> 21:32.100\n I'm fascinated by how they go together,\n\n21:32.100 --> 21:37.100\n both as a thing to do and as an endeavor that people do.\n\n21:38.260 --> 21:40.000\n How people and computers go together?\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:40.840\n Yeah.\n\n21:40.840 --> 21:43.020\n Like how people think and build a computer.\n\n21:44.180 --> 21:47.800\n And I find sometimes that the best computer architects\n\n21:47.800 --> 21:49.200\n aren't that interested in people,\n\n21:49.200 --> 21:51.780\n or the best people managers aren't that good\n\n21:51.780 --> 21:53.260\n at designing computers.\n\n21:54.400 --> 21:56.840\n So the whole stack of human beings is fascinating.\n\n21:56.840 --> 21:58.840\n So the managers, the individual engineers.\n\n21:58.840 --> 21:59.920\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n21:59.920 --> 22:02.360\n Yeah, I said I realized after a lot of years\n\n22:02.360 --> 22:04.400\n of building computers, where you sort of build them\n\n22:04.400 --> 22:06.960\n out of transistors, logic gates, functional units,\n\n22:06.960 --> 22:09.760\n computational elements, that you could think of people\n\n22:09.760 --> 22:12.640\n the same way, so people are functional units.\n\n22:12.640 --> 22:14.560\n And then you could think of organizational design\n\n22:14.560 --> 22:16.920\n as a computer architecture problem.\n\n22:16.920 --> 22:19.280\n And then it was like, oh, that's super cool,\n\n22:19.280 --> 22:20.680\n because the people are all different,\n\n22:20.680 --> 22:23.680\n just like the computational elements are all different.\n\n22:23.680 --> 22:25.440\n And they like to do different things.\n\n22:25.440 --> 22:29.200\n And so I had a lot of fun reframing\n\n22:29.200 --> 22:31.300\n how I think about organizations.\n\n22:31.300 --> 22:35.980\n Just like with computers, we were saying execution paths,\n\n22:35.980 --> 22:37.820\n you can have a lot of different paths that end up\n\n22:37.820 --> 22:41.660\n at the same good destination.\n\n22:41.660 --> 22:45.840\n So what have you learned about the human abstractions\n\n22:45.840 --> 22:48.920\n from individual functional human units\n\n22:48.920 --> 22:51.920\n to the broader organization?\n\n22:51.920 --> 22:55.080\n What does it take to create something special?\n\n22:55.080 --> 22:58.780\n Well, most people don't think simple enough.\n\n23:00.320 --> 23:02.800\n All right, so the difference between a recipe\n\n23:02.800 --> 23:04.160\n and the understanding.\n\n23:04.160 --> 23:09.160\n There's probably a philosophical description of this.\n\n23:09.160 --> 23:11.480\n So imagine you're gonna make a loaf of bread.\n\n23:11.480 --> 23:14.040\n The recipe says get some flour, add some water,\n\n23:14.040 --> 23:16.800\n add some yeast, mix it up, let it rise,\n\n23:16.800 --> 23:19.400\n put it in a pan, put it in the oven.\n\n23:19.400 --> 23:20.240\n It's a recipe.\n\n23:21.320 --> 23:24.720\n Understanding bread, you can understand biology,\n\n23:24.720 --> 23:29.720\n supply chains, grain grinders, yeast, physics,\n\n23:29.720 --> 23:34.720\n thermodynamics, there's so many levels of understanding.\n\n23:37.240 --> 23:40.220\n And then when people build and design things,\n\n23:40.220 --> 23:43.660\n they frequently are executing some stack of recipes.\n\n23:45.160 --> 23:46.920\n And the problem with that is the recipes\n\n23:46.920 --> 23:48.880\n all have limited scope.\n\n23:48.880 --> 23:50.640\n Like if you have a really good recipe book\n\n23:50.640 --> 23:52.280\n for making bread, it won't tell you anything\n\n23:52.280 --> 23:53.680\n about how to make an omelet.\n\n23:54.840 --> 23:57.320\n But if you have a deep understanding of cooking,\n\n23:57.320 --> 24:02.320\n right, than bread, omelets, you know, sandwich,\n\n24:03.680 --> 24:07.680\n you know, there's a different way of viewing everything.\n\n24:07.680 --> 24:12.680\n And most people, when you get to be an expert at something,\n\n24:13.020 --> 24:16.380\n you know, you're hoping to achieve deeper understanding,\n\n24:16.380 --> 24:19.920\n not just a large set of recipes to go execute.\n\n24:20.860 --> 24:22.800\n And it's interesting to walk groups of people\n\n24:22.800 --> 24:27.600\n because executing recipes is unbelievably efficient\n\n24:27.600 --> 24:29.160\n if it's what you want to do.\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:33.520\n If it's not what you want to do, you're really stuck.\n\n24:34.800 --> 24:36.600\n And that difference is crucial.\n\n24:36.600 --> 24:39.480\n And everybody has a balance of, let's say,\n\n24:39.480 --> 24:40.960\n deeper understanding of recipes.\n\n24:40.960 --> 24:43.760\n And some people are really good at recognizing\n\n24:43.760 --> 24:46.360\n when the problem is to understand something deeply.\n\n24:47.720 --> 24:49.040\n Does that make sense?\n\n24:49.040 --> 24:52.800\n It totally makes sense, does every stage of development,\n\n24:52.800 --> 24:55.560\n deep understanding on the team needed?\n\n24:55.560 --> 24:58.640\n Oh, this goes back to the art versus science question.\n\n24:58.640 --> 24:59.480\n Sure.\n\n24:59.480 --> 25:01.240\n If you constantly unpack everything\n\n25:01.240 --> 25:04.200\n for deeper understanding, you never get anything done.\n\n25:04.200 --> 25:06.880\n And if you don't unpack understanding when you need to,\n\n25:06.880 --> 25:08.480\n you'll do the wrong thing.\n\n25:09.480 --> 25:12.040\n And then at every juncture, like human beings\n\n25:12.040 --> 25:15.240\n are these really weird things because everything you tell them\n\n25:15.240 --> 25:18.320\n has a million possible outputs, right?\n\n25:18.320 --> 25:21.080\n And then they all interact in a hilarious way.\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:21.920\n Yeah, it's very interesting.\n\n25:21.920 --> 25:24.240\n And then having some intuition about what you tell them,\n\n25:24.240 --> 25:26.680\n what you do, when do you intervene, when do you not,\n\n25:26.680 --> 25:28.720\n it's complicated.\n\n25:28.720 --> 25:29.760\n Right, so.\n\n25:29.760 --> 25:33.200\n It's essentially computationally unsolvable.\n\n25:33.200 --> 25:35.320\n Yeah, it's an intractable problem, sure.\n\n25:36.640 --> 25:37.960\n Humans are a mess.\n\n25:37.960 --> 25:41.800\n But with deep understanding,\n\n25:41.800 --> 25:44.560\n do you mean also sort of fundamental questions\n\n25:44.560 --> 25:49.560\n of things like what is a computer?\n\n25:51.360 --> 25:55.000\n Or why, like the why questions,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.760\n why are we even building this, like of purpose?\n\n25:58.760 --> 26:02.200\n Or do you mean more like going towards\n\n26:02.200 --> 26:04.280\n the fundamental limits of physics,\n\n26:04.280 --> 26:07.480\n sort of really getting into the core of the science?\n\n26:07.480 --> 26:11.360\n In terms of building a computer, think a little simpler.\n\n26:11.360 --> 26:14.640\n So common practice is you build a computer,\n\n26:14.640 --> 26:17.760\n and then when somebody says, I wanna make it 10% faster,\n\n26:17.760 --> 26:19.240\n you'll go in and say, all right,\n\n26:19.240 --> 26:20.840\n I need to make this buffer bigger,\n\n26:20.840 --> 26:23.000\n and maybe I'll add an add unit.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.360\n Or I have this thing that's three instructions wide,\n\n26:25.360 --> 26:27.600\n I'm gonna make it four instructions wide.\n\n26:27.600 --> 26:30.480\n And what you see is each piece\n\n26:30.480 --> 26:34.240\n gets incrementally more complicated, right?\n\n26:34.240 --> 26:37.080\n And then at some point you hit this limit,\n\n26:37.080 --> 26:39.040\n like adding another feature or buffer\n\n26:39.040 --> 26:41.200\n doesn't seem to make it any faster.\n\n26:41.200 --> 26:42.040\n And then people will say,\n\n26:42.040 --> 26:45.400\n well, that's because it's a fundamental limit.\n\n26:45.400 --> 26:46.960\n And then somebody else will look at it and say,\n\n26:46.960 --> 26:49.440\n well, actually the way you divided the problem up\n\n26:49.440 --> 26:52.000\n and the way the different features are interacting\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.040\n is limiting you, and it has to be rethought, rewritten.\n\n26:56.280 --> 26:58.160\n So then you refactor it and rewrite it,\n\n26:58.160 --> 27:00.960\n and what people commonly find is the rewrite\n\n27:00.960 --> 27:03.600\n is not only faster, but half as complicated.\n\n27:03.600 --> 27:05.080\n From scratch? Yes.\n\n27:05.080 --> 27:08.920\n So how often in your career, but just have you seen\n\n27:08.920 --> 27:11.560\n is needed, maybe more generally,\n\n27:11.560 --> 27:14.280\n to just throw the whole thing out and start over?\n\n27:14.280 --> 27:17.040\n This is where I'm on one end of it,\n\n27:17.040 --> 27:19.120\n every three to five years.\n\n27:19.120 --> 27:21.120\n Which end are you on?\n\n27:21.120 --> 27:22.720\n Rewrite more often.\n\n27:22.720 --> 27:25.200\n Rewrite, and three to five years is?\n\n27:25.200 --> 27:27.000\n If you wanna really make a lot of progress\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.960\n on computer architecture, every five years\n\n27:28.960 --> 27:30.520\n you should do one from scratch.\n\n27:31.960 --> 27:36.920\n So where does the x86.64 standard come in?\n\n27:36.920 --> 27:38.960\n How often do you?\n\n27:38.960 --> 27:42.360\n I was the coauthor of that spec in 98.\n\n27:42.360 --> 27:43.880\n That's 20 years ago.\n\n27:43.880 --> 27:45.880\n Yeah, so that's still around.\n\n27:45.880 --> 27:48.280\n The instruction set itself has been extended\n\n27:48.280 --> 27:50.000\n quite a few times.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.520\n And instruction sets are less interesting\n\n27:52.520 --> 27:54.760\n than the implementation underneath.\n\n27:54.760 --> 27:58.680\n There's been, on x86 architecture, Intel's designed a few,\n\n27:58.680 --> 28:02.520\n AIM designed a few very different architectures.\n\n28:02.520 --> 28:06.520\n And I don't wanna go into too much of the detail\n\n28:06.520 --> 28:10.640\n about how often, but there's a tendency\n\n28:10.640 --> 28:12.560\n to rewrite it every 10 years,\n\n28:12.560 --> 28:14.240\n and it really should be every five.\n\n28:15.200 --> 28:17.880\n So you're saying you're an outlier in that sense.\n\n28:17.880 --> 28:19.080\n Rewrite more often.\n\n28:19.080 --> 28:20.080\n Rewrite more often.\n\n28:20.080 --> 28:20.920\n Well, and here's the problem.\n\n28:20.920 --> 28:22.120\n Isn't that scary?\n\n28:22.120 --> 28:23.680\n Yeah, of course.\n\n28:23.680 --> 28:25.200\n Well, scary to who?\n\n28:25.200 --> 28:28.200\n To everybody involved, because like you said,\n\n28:28.200 --> 28:30.680\n repeating the recipe is efficient.\n\n28:30.680 --> 28:34.160\n Companies wanna make money.\n\n28:34.160 --> 28:36.360\n No, individual engineers wanna succeed,\n\n28:36.360 --> 28:39.000\n so you wanna incrementally improve,\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.280\n increase the buffer from three to four.\n\n28:41.280 --> 28:42.720\n Well, this is where you get\n\n28:42.720 --> 28:45.440\n into the diminishing return curves.\n\n28:45.440 --> 28:46.920\n I think Steve Jobs said this, right?\n\n28:46.920 --> 28:49.880\n So every, you have a project, and you start here,\n\n28:49.880 --> 28:52.360\n and it goes up, and you have diminishing return.\n\n28:52.360 --> 28:54.760\n And to get to the next level, you have to do a new one,\n\n28:54.760 --> 28:57.640\n and the initial starting point will be lower\n\n28:57.640 --> 29:01.840\n than the old optimization point, but it'll get higher.\n\n29:01.840 --> 29:03.560\n So now you have two kinds of fear,\n\n29:03.560 --> 29:07.520\n short term disaster and long term disaster.\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:08.600\n And you're, you're haunted.\n\n29:08.600 --> 29:12.160\n So grown ups, right, like, you know,\n\n29:12.160 --> 29:15.240\n people with a quarter by quarter business objective\n\n29:15.240 --> 29:17.840\n are terrified about changing everything.\n\n29:17.840 --> 29:21.040\n And people who are trying to run a business\n\n29:21.040 --> 29:23.960\n or build a computer for a long term objective\n\n29:23.960 --> 29:27.200\n know that the short term limitations block them\n\n29:27.200 --> 29:29.360\n from the long term success.\n\n29:29.360 --> 29:32.720\n So if you look at leaders of companies\n\n29:32.720 --> 29:35.200\n that had really good long term success,\n\n29:35.200 --> 29:39.000\n every time they saw that they had to redo something, they did.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.040\n And so somebody has to speak up.\n\n29:41.040 --> 29:43.080\n Or you do multiple projects in parallel,\n\n29:43.080 --> 29:46.720\n like you optimize the old one while you build a new one.\n\n29:46.720 --> 29:48.200\n But the marketing guys are always like,\n\n29:48.200 --> 29:49.960\n make promise me that the new computer\n\n29:49.960 --> 29:52.720\n is faster on every single thing.\n\n29:52.720 --> 29:53.920\n And the computer architect says,\n\n29:53.920 --> 29:56.720\n well, the new computer will be faster on the average,\n\n29:56.720 --> 29:59.480\n but there's a distribution of results and performance,\n\n29:59.480 --> 30:01.920\n and you'll have some outliers that are slower.\n\n30:01.920 --> 30:02.760\n And that's very hard,\n\n30:02.760 --> 30:05.280\n because they have one customer who cares about that one.\n\n30:05.280 --> 30:08.960\n So speaking of the long term, for over 50 years now,\n\n30:08.960 --> 30:12.880\n Moore's Law has served, for me and millions of others,\n\n30:12.880 --> 30:16.640\n as an inspiring beacon of what kind of amazing future\n\n30:16.640 --> 30:18.040\n brilliant engineers can build.\n\n30:18.040 --> 30:19.360\n Yep.\n\n30:19.360 --> 30:21.880\n I'm just making your kids laugh all of today.\n\n30:21.880 --> 30:23.480\n That was great.\n\n30:23.480 --> 30:27.560\n So first, in your eyes, what is Moore's Law,\n\n30:27.560 --> 30:29.920\n if you could define for people who don't know?\n\n30:29.920 --> 30:34.280\n Well, the simple statement was, from Gordon Moore,\n\n30:34.280 --> 30:37.880\n was double the number of transistors every two years.\n\n30:37.880 --> 30:39.320\n Something like that.\n\n30:39.320 --> 30:43.240\n And then my operational model is,\n\n30:43.240 --> 30:45.840\n we increase the performance of computers\n\n30:45.840 --> 30:48.520\n by two X every two or three years.\n\n30:48.520 --> 30:51.400\n And it's wiggled around substantially over time.\n\n30:51.400 --> 30:55.160\n And also, in how we deliver, performance has changed.\n\n30:55.160 --> 31:00.160\n But the foundational idea was\n\n31:00.480 --> 31:02.920\n two X to transistors every two years.\n\n31:02.920 --> 31:05.760\n The current cadence is something like,\n\n31:05.760 --> 31:10.040\n they call it a shrink factor, like 0.6 every two years,\n\n31:10.040 --> 31:11.920\n which is not 0.5.\n\n31:11.920 --> 31:13.800\n But that's referring strictly, again,\n\n31:13.800 --> 31:15.360\n to the original definition of just.\n\n31:15.360 --> 31:16.680\n A transistor count.\n\n31:16.680 --> 31:18.060\n A shrink factor's just getting them\n\n31:18.060 --> 31:19.040\n smaller and smaller and smaller.\n\n31:19.040 --> 31:21.760\n Well, it's for a constant chip area.\n\n31:21.760 --> 31:24.200\n If you make the transistors smaller by 0.6,\n\n31:24.200 --> 31:27.200\n then you get one over 0.6 more transistors.\n\n31:27.200 --> 31:29.140\n So can you linger on it a little longer?\n\n31:29.140 --> 31:31.680\n What's a broader, what do you think should be\n\n31:31.680 --> 31:33.920\n the broader definition of Moore's Law?\n\n31:33.920 --> 31:37.920\n When you mentioned how you think of performance,\n\n31:37.920 --> 31:41.480\n just broadly, what's a good way to think about Moore's Law?\n\n31:42.360 --> 31:45.600\n Well, first of all, I've been aware\n\n31:45.600 --> 31:47.220\n of Moore's Law for 30 years.\n\n31:48.160 --> 31:49.100\n In which sense?\n\n31:49.100 --> 31:52.920\n Well, I've been designing computers for 40.\n\n31:52.920 --> 31:56.040\n You're just watching it before your eyes kind of thing.\n\n31:56.040 --> 31:58.160\n And somewhere where I became aware of it,\n\n31:58.160 --> 31:59.800\n I was also informed that Moore's Law\n\n31:59.800 --> 32:02.240\n was gonna die in 10 to 15 years.\n\n32:02.240 --> 32:03.940\n And then I thought that was true at first.\n\n32:03.940 --> 32:07.320\n But then after 10 years, it was gonna die in 10 to 15 years.\n\n32:07.320 --> 32:09.800\n And then at one point, it was gonna die in five years.\n\n32:09.800 --> 32:11.320\n And then it went back up to 10 years.\n\n32:11.320 --> 32:13.440\n And at some point, I decided not to worry\n\n32:13.440 --> 32:16.680\n about that particular prognostication\n\n32:16.680 --> 32:19.640\n for the rest of my life, which is fun.\n\n32:19.640 --> 32:21.560\n And then I joined Intel and everybody said\n\n32:21.560 --> 32:22.840\n Moore's Law is dead.\n\n32:22.840 --> 32:23.720\n And I thought that's sad,\n\n32:23.720 --> 32:25.640\n because it's the Moore's Law company.\n\n32:25.640 --> 32:26.920\n And it's not dead.\n\n32:26.920 --> 32:29.200\n And it's always been gonna die.\n\n32:29.200 --> 32:33.360\n And humans like these apocryphal kind of statements,\n\n32:33.360 --> 32:36.280\n like we'll run out of food, or we'll run out of air,\n\n32:36.280 --> 32:39.960\n or we'll run out of room, or we'll run out of something.\n\n32:39.960 --> 32:41.920\n Right, but it's still incredible\n\n32:41.920 --> 32:44.640\n that it's lived for as long as it has.\n\n32:44.640 --> 32:47.640\n And yes, there's many people who believe now\n\n32:47.640 --> 32:50.180\n that Moore's Law is dead.\n\n32:50.180 --> 32:52.840\n You know, they can join the last 50 years\n\n32:52.840 --> 32:53.680\n of people who had the same idea.\n\n32:53.680 --> 32:55.400\n Yeah, there's a long tradition.\n\n32:55.400 --> 33:00.400\n But why do you think, if you can try to understand it,\n\n33:00.840 --> 33:03.080\n why do you think it's not dead?\n\n33:03.080 --> 33:06.600\n Well, let's just think, people think Moore's Law\n\n33:06.600 --> 33:09.160\n is one thing, transistors get smaller.\n\n33:09.160 --> 33:10.200\n But actually, under the sheet,\n\n33:10.200 --> 33:12.520\n there's literally thousands of innovations.\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:14.120\n And almost all those innovations\n\n33:14.120 --> 33:17.360\n have their own diminishing return curves.\n\n33:17.360 --> 33:19.400\n So if you graph it, it looks like a cascade\n\n33:19.400 --> 33:21.440\n of diminishing return curves.\n\n33:21.440 --> 33:22.660\n I don't know what to call that.\n\n33:22.660 --> 33:26.480\n But the result is an exponential curve.\n\n33:26.480 --> 33:27.940\n Well, at least it has been.\n\n33:27.940 --> 33:30.920\n So, and we keep inventing new things.\n\n33:30.920 --> 33:32.960\n So if you're an expert in one of the things\n\n33:32.960 --> 33:35.920\n on a diminishing return curve, right,\n\n33:35.920 --> 33:38.480\n and you can see it's plateau,\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:42.220\n you will probably tell people, well, this is done.\n\n33:42.220 --> 33:43.640\n Meanwhile, some other pile of people\n\n33:43.640 --> 33:46.400\n are doing something different.\n\n33:46.400 --> 33:48.280\n So that's just normal.\n\n33:48.280 --> 33:50.400\n So then there's the observation of\n\n33:50.400 --> 33:54.060\n how small could a switching device be?\n\n33:54.060 --> 33:55.760\n So a modern transistor is something like\n\n33:55.760 --> 33:59.900\n a thousand by a thousand by a thousand atoms, right?\n\n33:59.900 --> 34:04.680\n And you get quantum effects down around two to 10 atoms.\n\n34:04.680 --> 34:06.280\n So you can imagine the transistor\n\n34:06.280 --> 34:08.240\n as small as 10 by 10 by 10.\n\n34:08.240 --> 34:12.080\n So that's a million times smaller.\n\n34:12.080 --> 34:14.500\n And then the quantum computational people\n\n34:14.500 --> 34:17.480\n are working away at how to use quantum effects.\n\n34:17.480 --> 34:18.320\n So.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.920\n A thousand by a thousand by a thousand.\n\n34:21.920 --> 34:22.760\n Atoms.\n\n34:23.740 --> 34:26.640\n That's a really clean way of putting it.\n\n34:26.640 --> 34:28.840\n Well, a fan, like a modern transistor,\n\n34:28.840 --> 34:32.060\n if you look at the fan, it's like 120 atoms wide,\n\n34:32.060 --> 34:33.360\n but we can make that thinner.\n\n34:33.360 --> 34:35.700\n And then there's a gate wrapped around it,\n\n34:35.700 --> 34:36.600\n and then there's spacing.\n\n34:36.600 --> 34:38.800\n There's a whole bunch of geometry.\n\n34:38.800 --> 34:42.040\n And a competent transistor designer\n\n34:42.040 --> 34:47.040\n could count both atoms in every single direction.\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.480\n Like there's techniques now to already put down atoms\n\n34:50.480 --> 34:52.000\n in a single atomic layer.\n\n34:53.080 --> 34:55.840\n And you can place atoms if you want to.\n\n34:55.840 --> 34:59.600\n It's just from a manufacturing process,\n\n34:59.600 --> 35:01.320\n if placing an atom takes 10 minutes\n\n35:01.320 --> 35:05.640\n and you need to put 10 to the 23rd atoms together\n\n35:05.640 --> 35:08.800\n to make a computer, it would take a long time.\n\n35:08.800 --> 35:13.340\n So the methods are both shrinking things\n\n35:13.340 --> 35:15.060\n and then coming up with effective ways\n\n35:15.060 --> 35:17.900\n to control what's happening.\n\n35:17.900 --> 35:20.060\n Manufacture stably and cheaply.\n\n35:20.060 --> 35:21.400\n Yeah.\n\n35:21.400 --> 35:23.840\n So the innovation stock's pretty broad.\n\n35:23.840 --> 35:26.880\n There's equipment, there's optics, there's chemistry,\n\n35:26.880 --> 35:29.240\n there's physics, there's material science,\n\n35:29.240 --> 35:31.960\n there's metallurgy, there's lots of ideas\n\n35:31.960 --> 35:33.720\n about when you put different materials together,\n\n35:33.720 --> 35:35.520\n how do they interact, are they stable,\n\n35:35.520 --> 35:40.520\n is it stable over temperature, like are they repeatable?\n\n35:40.880 --> 35:45.000\n There's like literally thousands of technologies involved.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:46.960\n But just for the shrinking, you don't think\n\n35:46.960 --> 35:50.960\n we're quite yet close to the fundamental limits of physics?\n\n35:50.960 --> 35:53.800\n I did a talk on Moore's Law and I asked for a roadmap\n\n35:53.800 --> 35:56.560\n to a path of 100 and after two weeks,\n\n35:56.560 --> 35:58.880\n they said we only got to 50.\n\n35:58.880 --> 35:59.720\n 100 what, sorry?\n\n35:59.720 --> 36:00.560\n 100 X shrink.\n\n36:00.560 --> 36:01.940\n 100 X shrink?\n\n36:01.940 --> 36:02.780\n We only got to 50.\n\n36:02.780 --> 36:05.720\n And I said, why don't you give it another two weeks?\n\n36:05.720 --> 36:09.680\n Well, here's the thing about Moore's Law, right?\n\n36:09.680 --> 36:14.180\n So I believe that the next 10 or 20 years\n\n36:14.180 --> 36:16.360\n of shrinking is gonna happen, right?\n\n36:16.360 --> 36:20.920\n Now, as a computer designer, you have two stances.\n\n36:20.920 --> 36:23.040\n You think it's going to shrink, in which case\n\n36:23.040 --> 36:26.160\n you're designing and thinking about architecture\n\n36:26.160 --> 36:29.020\n in a way that you'll use more transistors.\n\n36:29.020 --> 36:32.880\n Or conversely, not be swamped by the complexity\n\n36:32.880 --> 36:36.120\n of all the transistors you get, right?\n\n36:36.120 --> 36:39.320\n You have to have a strategy, you know?\n\n36:39.320 --> 36:42.100\n So you're open to the possibility and waiting\n\n36:42.100 --> 36:44.160\n for the possibility of a whole new army\n\n36:44.160 --> 36:45.960\n of transistors ready to work.\n\n36:45.960 --> 36:50.380\n I'm expecting more transistors every two or three years\n\n36:50.380 --> 36:54.360\n by a number large enough that how you think about design,\n\n36:54.360 --> 36:57.200\n how you think about architecture has to change.\n\n36:57.200 --> 37:01.080\n Like, imagine you build buildings out of bricks,\n\n37:01.080 --> 37:03.240\n and every year the bricks are half the size,\n\n37:04.520 --> 37:05.880\n or every two years.\n\n37:05.880 --> 37:08.360\n Well, if you kept building bricks the same way,\n\n37:08.360 --> 37:10.440\n so many bricks per person per day,\n\n37:11.280 --> 37:13.600\n the amount of time to build a building\n\n37:13.600 --> 37:16.980\n would go up exponentially, right?\n\n37:16.980 --> 37:19.200\n But if you said, I know that's coming,\n\n37:19.200 --> 37:22.360\n so now I'm gonna design equipment that moves bricks faster,\n\n37:22.360 --> 37:24.440\n uses them better, because maybe you're getting something\n\n37:24.440 --> 37:27.520\n out of the smaller bricks, more strength, thinner walls,\n\n37:27.520 --> 37:30.360\n you know, less material, efficiency out of that.\n\n37:30.360 --> 37:33.260\n So once you have a roadmap with what's gonna happen,\n\n37:33.260 --> 37:36.520\n transistors, we're gonna get more of them,\n\n37:36.520 --> 37:38.760\n then you design all this collateral around it\n\n37:38.760 --> 37:42.440\n to take advantage of it, and also to cope with it.\n\n37:42.440 --> 37:43.760\n Like, that's the thing people don't understand.\n\n37:43.760 --> 37:46.120\n It's like, if I didn't believe in Moore's Law,\n\n37:46.120 --> 37:48.760\n and then Moore's Law transistors showed up,\n\n37:48.760 --> 37:50.440\n my design teams would all drown.\n\n37:50.440 --> 37:55.440\n So what's the hardest part of this inflow\n\n37:56.180 --> 37:57.380\n of new transistors?\n\n37:57.380 --> 37:59.500\n I mean, even if you just look historically,\n\n37:59.500 --> 38:03.740\n throughout your career, what's the thing,\n\n38:03.740 --> 38:06.980\n what fundamentally changes when you add more transistors\n\n38:06.980 --> 38:10.800\n in the task of designing an architecture?\n\n38:10.800 --> 38:12.500\n Well, there's two constants, right?\n\n38:12.500 --> 38:14.160\n One is people don't get smarter.\n\n38:16.100 --> 38:17.300\n By the way, there's some science showing\n\n38:17.300 --> 38:20.340\n that we do get smarter because of nutrition or whatever.\n\n38:21.260 --> 38:22.100\n Sorry to bring that up.\n\n38:22.100 --> 38:22.940\n Blend effect.\n\n38:22.940 --> 38:23.760\n Yes.\n\n38:23.760 --> 38:24.600\n Yeah, I'm familiar with it.\n\n38:24.600 --> 38:26.300\n Nobody understands it, nobody knows if it's still going on.\n\n38:26.300 --> 38:27.180\n So that's a...\n\n38:27.180 --> 38:28.540\n Or whether it's real or not.\n\n38:28.540 --> 38:30.220\n But yeah, it's a...\n\n38:30.220 --> 38:31.300\n I sort of...\n\n38:31.300 --> 38:32.140\n Anyway, but not exponentially.\n\n38:32.140 --> 38:33.480\n I would believe for the most part,\n\n38:33.480 --> 38:35.500\n people aren't getting much smarter.\n\n38:35.500 --> 38:37.540\n The evidence doesn't support it, that's right.\n\n38:37.540 --> 38:40.100\n And then teams can't grow that much.\n\n38:40.100 --> 38:40.940\n Right.\n\n38:40.940 --> 38:43.380\n Right, so human beings, you know,\n\n38:43.380 --> 38:45.780\n we're really good in teams of 10,\n\n38:45.780 --> 38:48.180\n you know, up to teams of 100, they can know each other.\n\n38:48.180 --> 38:50.840\n Beyond that, you have to have organizational boundaries.\n\n38:50.840 --> 38:51.940\n So you're kind of, you have,\n\n38:51.940 --> 38:54.680\n those are pretty hard constraints, right?\n\n38:54.680 --> 38:56.420\n So then you have to divide and conquer,\n\n38:56.420 --> 38:57.940\n like as the designs get bigger,\n\n38:57.940 --> 39:00.260\n you have to divide it into pieces.\n\n39:00.260 --> 39:03.220\n You know, the power of abstraction layers is really high.\n\n39:03.220 --> 39:06.120\n We used to build computers out of transistors.\n\n39:06.120 --> 39:08.900\n Now we have a team that turns transistors into logic cells\n\n39:08.900 --> 39:10.700\n and another team that turns them into functional units,\n\n39:10.700 --> 39:13.180\n another one that turns them into computers, right?\n\n39:13.180 --> 39:16.100\n So we have abstraction layers in there\n\n39:16.100 --> 39:21.100\n and you have to think about when do you shift gears on that.\n\n39:21.380 --> 39:24.340\n We also use faster computers to build faster computers.\n\n39:24.340 --> 39:27.820\n So some algorithms run twice as fast on new computers,\n\n39:27.820 --> 39:30.460\n but a lot of algorithms are N squared.\n\n39:30.460 --> 39:33.600\n So, you know, a computer with twice as many transistors\n\n39:33.600 --> 39:36.540\n and it might take four times as long to run.\n\n39:36.540 --> 39:39.380\n So you have to refactor the software.\n\n39:39.380 --> 39:41.040\n Like simply using faster computers\n\n39:41.040 --> 39:43.100\n to build bigger computers doesn't work.\n\n39:44.180 --> 39:46.260\n So you have to think about all these things.\n\n39:46.260 --> 39:47.900\n So in terms of computing performance\n\n39:47.900 --> 39:49.300\n and the exciting possibility\n\n39:49.300 --> 39:51.580\n that more powerful computers bring,\n\n39:51.580 --> 39:55.220\n is shrinking the thing which you've been talking about,\n\n39:57.020 --> 39:59.880\n for you, one of the biggest exciting possibilities\n\n39:59.880 --> 40:01.540\n of advancement in performance?\n\n40:01.540 --> 40:03.940\n Or is there other directions that you're interested in,\n\n40:03.940 --> 40:08.940\n like in the direction of sort of enforcing given parallelism\n\n40:08.940 --> 40:12.180\n or like doing massive parallelism\n\n40:12.180 --> 40:15.020\n in terms of many, many CPUs,\n\n40:15.020 --> 40:17.660\n you know, stacking CPUs on top of each other,\n\n40:17.660 --> 40:20.780\n that kind of parallelism or any kind of parallelism?\n\n40:20.780 --> 40:22.220\n Well, think about it a different way.\n\n40:22.220 --> 40:25.220\n So old computers, you know, slow computers,\n\n40:25.220 --> 40:30.220\n you said A equal B plus C times D, pretty simple, right?\n\n40:30.580 --> 40:33.480\n And then we made faster computers with vector units\n\n40:33.480 --> 40:38.480\n and you can do proper equations and matrices, right?\n\n40:38.480 --> 40:41.080\n And then modern like AI computations\n\n40:41.080 --> 40:43.400\n or like convolutional neural networks,\n\n40:43.400 --> 40:47.080\n where you convolve one large data set against another.\n\n40:47.080 --> 40:51.140\n And so there's sort of this hierarchy of mathematics,\n\n40:51.140 --> 40:54.060\n you know, from simple equation to linear equations,\n\n40:54.060 --> 40:58.760\n to matrix equations, to deeper kind of computation.\n\n40:58.760 --> 41:00.600\n And the data sets are getting so big\n\n41:00.600 --> 41:04.360\n that people are thinking of data as a topology problem.\n\n41:04.360 --> 41:07.960\n You know, data is organized in some immense shape.\n\n41:07.960 --> 41:11.160\n And then the computation, which sort of wants to be,\n\n41:11.160 --> 41:15.320\n get data from immense shape and do some computation on it.\n\n41:15.320 --> 41:18.120\n So what computers have allowed people to do\n\n41:18.120 --> 41:21.400\n is have algorithms go much, much further.\n\n41:22.480 --> 41:26.640\n So that paper you reference, the Sutton paper,\n\n41:26.640 --> 41:29.120\n they talked about, you know, like when AI started,\n\n41:29.120 --> 41:31.860\n it was apply rule sets to something.\n\n41:31.860 --> 41:35.780\n That's a very simple computational situation.\n\n41:35.780 --> 41:37.840\n And then when they did first chess thing,\n\n41:37.840 --> 41:39.880\n they solved deep searches.\n\n41:39.880 --> 41:44.680\n So have a huge database of moves and results, deep search,\n\n41:44.680 --> 41:48.140\n but it's still just a search, right?\n\n41:48.140 --> 41:51.140\n Now we take large numbers of images\n\n41:51.140 --> 41:54.360\n and we use it to train these weight sets\n\n41:54.360 --> 41:56.240\n that we convolve across.\n\n41:56.240 --> 41:58.880\n It's a completely different kind of phenomena.\n\n41:58.880 --> 41:59.960\n We call that AI.\n\n41:59.960 --> 42:02.440\n Now they're doing the next generation.\n\n42:02.440 --> 42:03.800\n And if you look at it,\n\n42:03.800 --> 42:07.560\n they're going up this mathematical graph, right?\n\n42:07.560 --> 42:11.200\n And then computations, both computation and data sets\n\n42:11.200 --> 42:13.940\n support going up that graph.\n\n42:13.940 --> 42:15.480\n Yeah, the kind of computation that might,\n\n42:15.480 --> 42:18.720\n I mean, I would argue that all of it is still a search,\n\n42:18.720 --> 42:20.000\n right?\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.780\n Just like you said, a topology problem with data sets,\n\n42:22.780 --> 42:27.040\n you're searching the data sets for valuable data\n\n42:27.040 --> 42:30.000\n and also the actual optimization of neural networks\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:33.040\n is a kind of search for the...\n\n42:33.040 --> 42:34.760\n I don't know, if you had looked at the interlayers\n\n42:34.760 --> 42:39.100\n of finding a cat, it's not a search.\n\n42:39.100 --> 42:41.120\n It's a set of endless projections.\n\n42:41.120 --> 42:42.760\n So, you know, a projection,\n\n42:42.760 --> 42:45.640\n here's a shadow of this phone, right?\n\n42:45.640 --> 42:47.680\n And then you can have a shadow of that on the something\n\n42:47.680 --> 42:49.240\n and a shadow on that of something.\n\n42:49.240 --> 42:51.440\n And if you look in the layers, you'll see\n\n42:51.440 --> 42:53.580\n this layer actually describes pointy ears\n\n42:53.580 --> 42:55.680\n and round eyeness and fuzziness.\n\n42:56.560 --> 43:01.560\n But the computation to tease out the attributes\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:03.700\n is not search.\n\n43:03.700 --> 43:05.960\n Like the inference part might be search,\n\n43:05.960 --> 43:07.440\n but the training's not search.\n\n43:07.440 --> 43:10.760\n And then in deep networks, they look at layers\n\n43:10.760 --> 43:13.140\n and they don't even know it's represented.\n\n43:14.340 --> 43:16.640\n And yet, if you take the layers out, it doesn't work.\n\n43:16.640 --> 43:18.940\n So I don't think it's search.\n\n43:18.940 --> 43:21.040\n But you'd have to talk to a mathematician\n\n43:21.040 --> 43:22.960\n about what that actually is.\n\n43:22.960 --> 43:27.000\n Well, we could disagree, but it's just semantics,\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.160\n I think, it's not, but it's certainly not...\n\n43:29.160 --> 43:31.920\n I would say it's absolutely not semantics, but...\n\n43:31.920 --> 43:35.440\n Okay, all right, well, if you want to go there.\n\n43:37.060 --> 43:39.020\n So optimization to me is search,\n\n43:39.020 --> 43:42.960\n and we're trying to optimize the ability\n\n43:42.960 --> 43:45.800\n of a neural network to detect cat ears.\n\n43:45.800 --> 43:50.800\n And the difference between chess and the space,\n\n43:51.060 --> 43:54.100\n the incredibly multidimensional,\n\n43:54.100 --> 43:57.360\n 100,000 dimensional space that neural networks\n\n43:57.360 --> 44:00.200\n are trying to optimize over is nothing like\n\n44:00.200 --> 44:02.200\n the chessboard database.\n\n44:02.200 --> 44:04.320\n So it's a totally different kind of thing.\n\n44:04.320 --> 44:07.720\n And okay, in that sense, you can say it loses the meaning.\n\n44:07.720 --> 44:11.240\n I can see how you might say, if you...\n\n44:11.240 --> 44:12.800\n The funny thing is, it's the difference\n\n44:12.800 --> 44:16.520\n between given search space and found search space.\n\n44:16.520 --> 44:17.360\n Right, exactly.\n\n44:17.360 --> 44:18.800\n Yeah, maybe that's a different way to describe it.\n\n44:18.800 --> 44:19.960\n That's a beautiful way to put it, okay.\n\n44:19.960 --> 44:21.720\n But you're saying, what's your sense\n\n44:21.720 --> 44:24.800\n in terms of the basic mathematical operations\n\n44:24.800 --> 44:27.800\n and the architectures, computer hardware\n\n44:27.800 --> 44:29.920\n that enables those operations?\n\n44:29.920 --> 44:33.000\n Do you see the CPUs of today still being\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\n a really core part of executing\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.640\n those mathematical operations?\n\n44:37.640 --> 44:38.560\n Yes.\n\n44:38.560 --> 44:42.280\n Well, the operations continue to be add, subtract,\n\n44:42.280 --> 44:44.640\n load, store, compare, and branch.\n\n44:44.640 --> 44:46.120\n It's remarkable.\n\n44:46.120 --> 44:48.840\n So it's interesting, the building blocks\n\n44:48.840 --> 44:52.760\n of computers or transistors under that atoms.\n\n44:52.760 --> 44:56.360\n So you got atoms, transistors, logic gates, computers,\n\n44:56.360 --> 44:58.360\n functional units of computers.\n\n44:58.360 --> 45:01.000\n The building blocks of mathematics at some level\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:04.440\n are things like adds and subtracts and multiplies,\n\n45:04.440 --> 45:08.360\n but the space mathematics can describe\n\n45:08.360 --> 45:11.240\n is, I think, essentially infinite.\n\n45:11.240 --> 45:14.080\n But the computers that run the algorithms\n\n45:14.080 --> 45:16.680\n are still doing the same things.\n\n45:16.680 --> 45:20.320\n Now, a given algorithm might say, I need sparse data,\n\n45:20.320 --> 45:24.800\n or I need 32 bit data, or I need, you know,\n\n45:24.800 --> 45:27.800\n like a convolution operation that naturally takes\n\n45:27.800 --> 45:31.680\n eight bit data, multiplies it, and sums it up a certain way.\n\n45:31.680 --> 45:35.200\n So like the data types in TensorFlow\n\n45:35.200 --> 45:38.240\n imply an optimization set.\n\n45:38.240 --> 45:40.480\n But when you go right down and look at the computers,\n\n45:40.480 --> 45:42.920\n it's and and or gates doing adds and multiplies.\n\n45:42.920 --> 45:46.280\n Like that hasn't changed much.\n\n45:46.280 --> 45:48.600\n Now, the quantum researchers think\n\n45:48.600 --> 45:50.000\n they're going to change that radically,\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.280\n and then there's people who think about analog computing\n\n45:52.280 --> 45:53.840\n because you look in the brain, and it\n\n45:53.840 --> 45:55.880\n seems to be more analogish.\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:58.040\n You know, that maybe there's a way to do that more\n\n45:58.040 --> 45:59.120\n efficiently.\n\n45:59.120 --> 46:03.520\n But we have a million X on computation,\n\n46:03.520 --> 46:07.760\n and I don't know the relationship\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:09.680\n between computational, let's say,\n\n46:09.680 --> 46:15.440\n intensity and ability to hit mathematical abstractions.\n\n46:15.440 --> 46:19.320\n I don't know any way to describe that, but just like you saw\n\n46:19.320 --> 46:23.000\n in AI, you went from rule sets to simple search\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:26.480\n to complex search to, say, found search.\n\n46:26.480 --> 46:30.080\n Like those are orders of magnitude more computation\n\n46:30.080 --> 46:31.600\n to do.\n\n46:31.600 --> 46:34.720\n And as we get the next two orders of magnitude,\n\n46:34.720 --> 46:36.480\n like a friend, Roger Gaduri, said,\n\n46:36.480 --> 46:40.240\n like every order of magnitude changes the computation.\n\n46:40.240 --> 46:42.720\n Fundamentally changes what the computation is doing.\n\n46:42.720 --> 46:44.760\n Yeah.\n\n46:44.760 --> 46:46.880\n Oh, you know the expression the difference in quantity\n\n46:46.880 --> 46:49.560\n is the difference in kind.\n\n46:49.560 --> 46:53.080\n You know, the difference between ant and anthill, right?\n\n46:53.080 --> 46:56.000\n Or neuron and brain.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.920\n You know, there's this indefinable place\n\n46:58.920 --> 47:02.520\n where the quantity changed the quality, right?\n\n47:02.520 --> 47:05.040\n And we've seen that happen in mathematics multiple times,\n\n47:05.040 --> 47:08.720\n and you know, my guess is it's going to keep happening.\n\n47:08.720 --> 47:12.280\n So your sense is, yeah, if you focus head down\n\n47:12.280 --> 47:14.920\n and shrinking the transistor.\n\n47:14.920 --> 47:18.000\n Well, it's not just head down, we're aware of the software\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.400\n stacks that are running in the computational loads,\n\n47:20.400 --> 47:22.360\n and we're kind of pondering what do you\n\n47:22.360 --> 47:24.880\n do with a petabyte of memory that wants\n\n47:24.880 --> 47:28.200\n to be accessed in a sparse way and have, you know,\n\n47:28.200 --> 47:32.720\n the kind of calculations AI programmers want.\n\n47:32.720 --> 47:34.760\n So there's a dialogue interaction,\n\n47:34.760 --> 47:38.120\n but when you go in the computer chip,\n\n47:38.120 --> 47:43.120\n you know, you find adders and subtractors and multipliers.\n\n47:43.120 --> 47:46.960\n So if you zoom out then with, as you mentioned very sudden,\n\n47:46.960 --> 47:50.160\n the idea that most of the development in the last many\n\n47:50.160 --> 47:54.320\n decades in AI research came from just leveraging computation\n\n47:54.320 --> 47:59.160\n and just simple algorithms waiting for the computation\n\n47:59.160 --> 48:00.040\n to improve.\n\n48:00.040 --> 48:03.760\n Well, software guys have a thing that they call it\n\n48:03.760 --> 48:07.080\n the problem of early optimization.\n\n48:07.080 --> 48:09.160\n So you write a big software stack,\n\n48:09.160 --> 48:12.360\n and if you start optimizing like the first thing you write,\n\n48:12.360 --> 48:15.400\n the odds of that being the performance limiter is low.\n\n48:15.400 --> 48:17.000\n But when you get the whole thing working,\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.760\n can you make it 2x faster by optimizing the right things?\n\n48:19.760 --> 48:21.040\n Sure.\n\n48:21.040 --> 48:22.760\n While you're optimizing that, could you\n\n48:22.760 --> 48:24.480\n have written a new software stack, which\n\n48:24.480 --> 48:26.000\n would have been a better choice?\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:27.080\n Maybe.\n\n48:27.080 --> 48:29.440\n Now you have creative tension.\n\n48:29.440 --> 48:30.200\n So.\n\n48:30.200 --> 48:33.080\n But the whole time as you're doing the writing,\n\n48:33.080 --> 48:34.880\n that's the software we're talking about.\n\n48:34.880 --> 48:36.840\n The hardware underneath gets faster and faster.\n\n48:36.840 --> 48:38.600\n Well, this goes back to the Moore's law.\n\n48:38.600 --> 48:43.680\n If Moore's law is going to continue, then your AI research\n\n48:43.680 --> 48:46.200\n should expect that to show up, and then you\n\n48:46.200 --> 48:48.680\n make a slightly different set of choices then.\n\n48:48.680 --> 48:49.800\n We've hit the wall.\n\n48:49.800 --> 48:51.440\n Nothing's going to happen.\n\n48:51.440 --> 48:55.200\n And from here, it's just us rewriting algorithms.\n\n48:55.200 --> 48:57.440\n That seems like a failed strategy for the last 30\n\n48:57.440 --> 49:00.120\n years of Moore's law's death.\n\n49:00.120 --> 49:03.240\n So can you just linger on it?\n\n49:03.240 --> 49:05.280\n I think you've answered it, but I'll just\n\n49:05.280 --> 49:06.960\n ask the same dumb question over and over.\n\n49:06.960 --> 49:12.480\n So why do you think Moore's law is not going to die?\n\n49:12.480 --> 49:15.680\n Which is the most promising, exciting possibility\n\n49:15.680 --> 49:17.960\n of why it won't die in the next 5, 10 years?\n\n49:17.960 --> 49:20.640\n So is it the continued shrinking of the transistor,\n\n49:20.640 --> 49:25.440\n or is it another S curve that steps in and it totally sort\n\n49:25.440 --> 49:26.080\n of matches up?\n\n49:26.080 --> 49:28.160\n Shrinking the transistor is literally\n\n49:28.160 --> 49:30.200\n thousands of innovations.\n\n49:30.200 --> 49:33.280\n Right, so there's stacks of S curves in there.\n\n49:33.280 --> 49:35.280\n There's a whole bunch of S curves just kind\n\n49:35.280 --> 49:38.680\n of running their course and being reinvented\n\n49:38.680 --> 49:41.720\n and new things.\n\n49:41.720 --> 49:45.880\n The semiconductor fabricators and technologists have all\n\n49:45.880 --> 49:47.360\n announced what's called nanowires.\n\n49:47.360 --> 49:51.120\n So they took a fan, which had a gate around it,\n\n49:51.120 --> 49:52.640\n and turned that into little wires\n\n49:52.640 --> 49:55.280\n so you have better control of that, and they're smaller.\n\n49:55.280 --> 49:57.240\n And then from there, there are some obvious steps\n\n49:57.240 --> 49:59.680\n about how to shrink that.\n\n49:59.680 --> 50:03.640\n The metallurgy around wire stacks and stuff\n\n50:03.640 --> 50:07.160\n has very obvious abilities to shrink.\n\n50:07.160 --> 50:11.000\n And there's a whole combination of things there to do.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.480\n Your sense is that we're going to get a lot\n\n50:13.480 --> 50:16.680\n if this innovation performed just that, shrinking.\n\n50:16.680 --> 50:19.440\n Yeah, like a factor of 100 is a lot.\n\n50:19.440 --> 50:22.120\n Yeah, I would say that's incredible.\n\n50:22.120 --> 50:23.720\n And it's totally unknown.\n\n50:23.720 --> 50:25.120\n It's only 10 or 15 years.\n\n50:25.120 --> 50:26.560\n Now, you're smarter, you might know,\n\n50:26.560 --> 50:28.160\n but to me it's totally unpredictable\n\n50:28.160 --> 50:30.160\n of what that 100x would bring in terms\n\n50:30.160 --> 50:34.440\n of the nature of the computation that people would be.\n\n50:34.440 --> 50:37.280\n Yeah, are you familiar with Bell's law?\n\n50:37.280 --> 50:40.720\n So for a long time, it was mainframes, minis, workstation,\n\n50:40.720 --> 50:42.480\n PC, mobile.\n\n50:42.480 --> 50:46.200\n Moore's law drove faster, smaller computers.\n\n50:46.200 --> 50:49.520\n And then when we were thinking about Moore's law,\n\n50:49.520 --> 50:53.280\n Rajagaduri said, every 10x generates a new computation.\n\n50:53.280 --> 51:01.120\n So scalar, vector, matrix, topological computation.\n\n51:01.120 --> 51:03.840\n And if you go look at the industry trends,\n\n51:03.840 --> 51:07.440\n there was mainframes, and then minicomputers, and then PCs,\n\n51:07.440 --> 51:08.920\n and then the internet took off.\n\n51:08.920 --> 51:10.760\n And then we got mobile devices.\n\n51:10.760 --> 51:12.680\n And now we're building 5G wireless\n\n51:12.680 --> 51:14.880\n with one millisecond latency.\n\n51:14.880 --> 51:17.120\n And people are starting to think about the smart world\n\n51:17.120 --> 51:23.200\n where everything knows you, recognizes you.\n\n51:23.200 --> 51:27.440\n The transformations are going to be unpredictable.\n\n51:27.440 --> 51:29.560\n How does it make you feel that you're\n\n51:29.560 --> 51:35.200\n one of the key architects of this kind of future?\n\n51:35.200 --> 51:37.160\n So we're not talking about the architects\n\n51:37.160 --> 51:42.320\n of the high level people who build the Angry Bird apps,\n\n51:42.320 --> 51:43.880\n and Snapchat.\n\n51:43.880 --> 51:44.720\n Angry Bird apps.\n\n51:44.720 --> 51:45.240\n Who knows?\n\n51:45.240 --> 51:47.120\n Maybe that's the whole point of the universe.\n\n51:47.120 --> 51:48.840\n I'm going to take a stand at that,\n\n51:48.840 --> 51:52.800\n and the attention distracting nature of mobile phones.\n\n51:52.800 --> 51:53.760\n I'll take a stand.\n\n51:53.760 --> 52:01.240\n But anyway, in terms of the side effects of smartphones,\n\n52:01.240 --> 52:03.680\n or the attention distraction, which part?\n\n52:03.680 --> 52:06.120\n Well, who knows where this is all leading?\n\n52:06.120 --> 52:08.200\n It's changing so fast.\n\n52:08.200 --> 52:09.720\n My parents used to yell at my sisters\n\n52:09.720 --> 52:13.120\n for hiding in the closet with a wired phone with a dial on it.\n\n52:13.120 --> 52:15.840\n Stop talking to your friends all day.\n\n52:15.840 --> 52:18.640\n Now my wife yells at my kids for talking to their friends\n\n52:18.640 --> 52:20.480\n all day on text.\n\n52:20.480 --> 52:21.760\n It looks the same to me.\n\n52:21.760 --> 52:23.560\n It's always echoes of the same thing.\n\n52:23.560 --> 52:26.640\n But you are one of the key people\n\n52:26.640 --> 52:29.120\n architecting the hardware of this future.\n\n52:29.120 --> 52:30.520\n How does that make you feel?\n\n52:30.520 --> 52:33.560\n Do you feel responsible?\n\n52:33.560 --> 52:36.040\n Do you feel excited?\n\n52:36.040 --> 52:38.080\n So we're in a social context.\n\n52:38.080 --> 52:40.920\n So there's billions of people on this planet.\n\n52:40.920 --> 52:45.320\n There are literally millions of people working on technology.\n\n52:45.320 --> 52:50.840\n I feel lucky to be doing what I do and getting paid for it,\n\n52:50.840 --> 52:52.800\n and there's an interest in it.\n\n52:52.800 --> 52:56.480\n But there's so many things going on in parallel.\n\n52:56.480 --> 52:58.360\n The actions are so unpredictable.\n\n52:58.360 --> 53:01.200\n If I wasn't here, somebody else would do it.\n\n53:01.200 --> 53:03.400\n The vectors of all these different things\n\n53:03.400 --> 53:06.120\n are happening all the time.\n\n53:06.120 --> 53:10.240\n You know, there's a, I'm sure, some philosopher\n\n53:10.240 --> 53:12.600\n or metaphilosopher is wondering about how\n\n53:12.600 --> 53:16.200\n we transform our world.\n\n53:16.200 --> 53:22.960\n So you can't deny the fact that these tools are\n\n53:22.960 --> 53:24.440\n changing our world.\n\n53:24.440 --> 53:25.320\n That's right.\n\n53:25.320 --> 53:29.640\n Do you think it's changing for the better?\n\n53:29.640 --> 53:31.280\n I read this thing recently.\n\n53:31.280 --> 53:36.280\n It said the two disciplines with the highest GRE scores in college\n\n53:36.280 --> 53:39.560\n are physics and philosophy.\n\n53:39.560 --> 53:41.880\n And they're both sort of trying to answer the question,\n\n53:41.880 --> 53:43.960\n why is there anything?\n\n53:43.960 --> 53:47.680\n And the philosophers are on the kind of theological side,\n\n53:47.680 --> 53:52.640\n and the physicists are obviously on the material side.\n\n53:52.640 --> 53:56.920\n And there's 100 billion galaxies with 100 billion stars.\n\n53:56.920 --> 54:01.000\n It seems, well, repetitive at best.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:06.240\n So you know, there's on our way to 10 billion people.\n\n54:06.240 --> 54:08.160\n I mean, it's hard to say what it's all for,\n\n54:08.160 --> 54:09.560\n if that's what you're asking.\n\n54:09.560 --> 54:11.280\n Yeah, I guess I am.\n\n54:11.280 --> 54:16.240\n Things do tend to significantly increase in complexity.\n\n54:16.240 --> 54:21.280\n And I'm curious about how computation,\n\n54:21.280 --> 54:24.480\n like our physical world inherently\n\n54:24.480 --> 54:25.880\n generates mathematics.\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:26.920\n It's kind of obvious, right?\n\n54:26.920 --> 54:28.640\n So we have x, y, z coordinates.\n\n54:28.640 --> 54:30.120\n You take a sphere, you make it bigger.\n\n54:30.120 --> 54:34.040\n You get a surface that grows by r squared.\n\n54:34.040 --> 54:36.360\n Like, it generally generates mathematics.\n\n54:36.360 --> 54:38.720\n And the mathematicians and the physicists\n\n54:38.720 --> 54:41.280\n have been having a lot of fun talking to each other for years.\n\n54:41.280 --> 54:46.080\n And computation has been, let's say, relatively pedestrian.\n\n54:46.080 --> 54:48.520\n Like, computation in terms of mathematics\n\n54:48.520 --> 54:52.760\n has been doing binary algebra, while those guys have\n\n54:52.760 --> 54:58.040\n been gallivanting through the other realms of possibility.\n\n54:58.040 --> 55:01.200\n Now recently, the computation lets\n\n55:01.200 --> 55:04.880\n you do mathematical computations that\n\n55:04.880 --> 55:07.520\n are sophisticated enough that nobody understands\n\n55:07.520 --> 55:10.000\n how the answers came out.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:10.760\n Machine learning.\n\n55:10.760 --> 55:12.000\n Machine learning.\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:16.800\n It used to be you get data set, you guess at a function.\n\n55:16.800 --> 55:18.920\n The function is considered physics\n\n55:18.920 --> 55:23.000\n if it's predictive of new functions, new data sets.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:28.320\n Modern, you can take a large data set\n\n55:28.320 --> 55:29.920\n with no intuition about what it is\n\n55:29.920 --> 55:31.960\n and use machine learning to find a pattern that\n\n55:31.960 --> 55:34.240\n has no function, right?\n\n55:34.240 --> 55:37.160\n And it can arrive at results that I\n\n55:37.160 --> 55:39.920\n don't know if they're completely mathematically describable.\n\n55:39.920 --> 55:44.560\n So computation has kind of done something interesting compared\n\n55:44.560 --> 55:47.160\n to a equal b plus c.\n\n55:47.160 --> 55:49.640\n There's something reminiscent of that step\n\n55:49.640 --> 55:54.760\n from the basic operations of addition\n\n55:54.760 --> 55:56.880\n to taking a step towards neural networks that's\n\n55:56.880 --> 56:01.040\n reminiscent of what life on Earth at its origins was doing.\n\n56:01.040 --> 56:03.440\n Do you think we're creating sort of the next step\n\n56:03.440 --> 56:06.520\n in our evolution in creating artificial intelligence\n\n56:06.520 --> 56:07.920\n systems that will?\n\n56:07.920 --> 56:08.680\n I don't know.\n\n56:08.680 --> 56:11.040\n I mean, there's so much in the universe already,\n\n56:11.040 --> 56:12.560\n it's hard to say.\n\n56:12.560 --> 56:14.000\n Where we stand in this whole thing.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:17.000\n Are human beings working on additional abstraction\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:18.480\n layers and possibilities?\n\n56:18.480 --> 56:20.280\n Yeah, it appears so.\n\n56:20.280 --> 56:22.960\n Does that mean that human beings don't need dogs?\n\n56:22.960 --> 56:24.120\n You know, no.\n\n56:24.120 --> 56:26.120\n Like, there's so many things that\n\n56:26.120 --> 56:30.400\n are all simultaneously interesting and useful.\n\n56:30.400 --> 56:32.480\n Well, you've seen, throughout your career,\n\n56:32.480 --> 56:35.720\n you've seen greater and greater level abstractions built\n\n56:35.720 --> 56:39.520\n in artificial machines, right?\n\n56:39.520 --> 56:41.280\n Do you think, when you look at humans,\n\n56:41.280 --> 56:44.040\n do you think that the look of all life on Earth\n\n56:44.040 --> 56:46.880\n is a single organism building this thing,\n\n56:46.880 --> 56:49.880\n this machine with greater and greater levels of abstraction?\n\n56:49.880 --> 56:52.720\n Do you think humans are the peak,\n\n56:52.720 --> 56:57.400\n the top of the food chain in this long arc of history\n\n56:57.400 --> 56:58.440\n on Earth?\n\n56:58.440 --> 57:00.600\n Or do you think we're just somewhere in the middle?\n\n57:00.600 --> 57:05.280\n Are we the basic functional operations of a CPU?\n\n57:05.280 --> 57:09.280\n Are we the C++ program, the Python program,\n\n57:09.280 --> 57:10.480\n or the neural network?\n\n57:10.480 --> 57:12.200\n Like, somebody's, you know, people\n\n57:12.200 --> 57:14.920\n have calculated, like, how many operations does the brain do?\n\n57:14.920 --> 57:17.680\n Something, you know, I've seen the number 10 to the 18th\n\n57:17.680 --> 57:20.600\n a bunch of times, arrive different ways.\n\n57:20.600 --> 57:22.080\n So could you make a computer that\n\n57:22.080 --> 57:23.760\n did 10 to the 20th operations?\n\n57:23.760 --> 57:24.360\n Yes.\n\n57:24.360 --> 57:24.880\n Sure.\n\n57:24.880 --> 57:25.720\n Do you think?\n\n57:25.720 --> 57:27.040\n We're going to do that.\n\n57:27.040 --> 57:31.640\n Now, is there something magical about how brains compute things?\n\n57:31.640 --> 57:32.960\n I don't know.\n\n57:32.960 --> 57:35.240\n You know, my personal experience is interesting,\n\n57:35.240 --> 57:37.760\n because, you know, you think you know how you think,\n\n57:37.760 --> 57:39.160\n and then you have all these ideas,\n\n57:39.160 --> 57:41.520\n and you can't figure out how they happened.\n\n57:41.520 --> 57:47.040\n And if you meditate, you know, what you can be aware of\n\n57:47.040 --> 57:48.760\n is interesting.\n\n57:48.760 --> 57:51.720\n So I don't know if brains are magical or not.\n\n57:51.720 --> 57:54.800\n You know, the physical evidence says no.\n\n57:54.800 --> 57:57.840\n Lots of people's personal experience says yes.\n\n57:57.840 --> 58:01.280\n So what would be funny is if brains are magical,\n\n58:01.280 --> 58:04.600\n and yet we can make brains with more computation.\n\n58:04.600 --> 58:07.080\n You know, I don't know what to say about that.\n\n58:07.080 --> 58:11.080\n But do you think magic is an emergent phenomena?\n\n58:11.080 --> 58:12.080\n Could be.\n\n58:12.080 --> 58:13.840\n I have no explanation for it.\n\n58:13.840 --> 58:19.240\n Let me ask Jim Keller of what in your view is consciousness?\n\n58:19.240 --> 58:20.640\n With consciousness?\n\n58:20.640 --> 58:25.520\n Yeah, like what, you know, consciousness, love,\n\n58:25.520 --> 58:27.960\n things that are these deeply human things that\n\n58:27.960 --> 58:30.280\n seems to emerge from our brain, is that something\n\n58:30.280 --> 58:36.280\n that we'll be able to make encode in chips that get\n\n58:36.280 --> 58:38.120\n faster and faster and faster and faster?\n\n58:38.120 --> 58:40.160\n That's like a 10 hour conversation.\n\n58:40.160 --> 58:41.000\n Nobody really knows.\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:45.320\n Can you summarize it in a couple of sentences?\n\n58:45.320 --> 58:48.840\n Many people have observed that organisms run\n\n58:48.840 --> 58:51.320\n at lots of different levels, right?\n\n58:51.320 --> 58:52.840\n If you had two neurons, somebody said\n\n58:52.840 --> 58:56.880\n you'd have one sensory neuron and one motor neuron, right?\n\n58:56.880 --> 58:58.800\n So we move towards things and away from things.\n\n58:58.800 --> 59:03.200\n And we have physical integrity and safety or not, right?\n\n59:03.200 --> 59:05.680\n And then if you look at the animal kingdom,\n\n59:05.680 --> 59:08.320\n you can see brains that are a little more complicated.\n\n59:08.320 --> 59:10.320\n And at some point, there's a planning system.\n\n59:10.320 --> 59:11.960\n And then there's an emotional system\n\n59:11.960 --> 59:17.240\n that's happy about being safe or unhappy about being threatened.\n\n59:17.240 --> 59:21.920\n And then our brains have massive numbers of structures,\n\n59:21.920 --> 59:25.680\n like planning and movement and thinking and feeling\n\n59:25.680 --> 59:27.920\n and drives and emotions.\n\n59:27.920 --> 59:31.160\n And we seem to have multiple layers of thinking systems.\n\n59:31.160 --> 59:35.240\n And we have a dream system that nobody understands whatsoever,\n\n59:35.240 --> 59:37.520\n which I find completely hilarious.\n\n59:37.520 --> 59:44.480\n And you can think in a way that those systems are\n\n59:44.480 --> 59:45.720\n more independent.\n\n59:45.720 --> 59:47.880\n And you can observe the different parts of yourself\n\n59:47.880 --> 59:49.600\n can observe them.\n\n59:49.600 --> 59:51.440\n I don't know which one's magical.\n\n59:51.440 --> 59:55.360\n I don't know which one's not computational.\n\n59:55.360 --> 59:56.800\n So.\n\n59:56.800 --> 59:58.880\n Is it possible that it's all computation?\n\n59:58.880 --> 1:00:00.120\n Probably.\n\n1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:01.560\n Is there a limit to computation?\n\n1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:03.200\n I don't think so.\n\n1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:06.240\n Do you think the universe is a computer?\n\n1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:07.480\n It seems to be.\n\n1:00:07.480 --> 1:00:09.600\n It's a weird kind of computer.\n\n1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:13.120\n Because if it was a computer, like when\n\n1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:16.560\n they do calculations on how much calculation\n\n1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:20.960\n it takes to describe quantum effects, it's unbelievably high.\n\n1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:22.560\n So if it was a computer, wouldn't you\n\n1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:26.240\n have built it out of something that was easier to compute?\n\n1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:29.560\n That's a funny system.\n\n1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:31.320\n But then the simulation guys pointed out\n\n1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:32.920\n that the rules are kind of interesting.\n\n1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.160\n When you look really close, it's uncertain.\n\n1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:37.720\n And the speed of light says you can only look so far.\n\n1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:39.200\n And things can't be simultaneous,\n\n1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:42.760\n except for the odd entanglement problem where they seem to be.\n\n1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:45.120\n The rules are all kind of weird.\n\n1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:47.960\n And somebody said physics is like having\n\n1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:51.360\n 50 equations with 50 variables to define 50 variables.\n\n1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:59.080\n Physics itself has been a shit show for thousands of years.\n\n1:00:59.080 --> 1:01:02.040\n It seems odd when you get to the corners of everything.\n\n1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:07.240\n It's either uncomputable or undefinable or uncertain.\n\n1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.360\n It's almost like the designers of the simulation\n\n1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:12.840\n are trying to prevent us from understanding it perfectly.\n\n1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:16.160\n But also, the things that require calculations\n\n1:01:16.160 --> 1:01:18.480\n require so much calculation that our idea\n\n1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:20.840\n of the universe of a computer is absurd,\n\n1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:23.160\n because every single little bit of it\n\n1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:26.640\n takes all the computation in the universe to figure out.\n\n1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.400\n So that's a weird kind of computer.\n\n1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:29.760\n You say the simulation is running\n\n1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:34.520\n in a computer, which has, by definition, infinite computation.\n\n1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:35.440\n Not infinite.\n\n1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:37.680\n Oh, you mean if the universe is infinite?\n\n1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:38.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:40.720\n Well, every little piece of our universe\n\n1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:43.240\n seems to take infinite computation to figure out.\n\n1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:44.240\n Not infinite, just a lot.\n\n1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:44.840\n Well, a lot.\n\n1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:46.040\n Some pretty big number.\n\n1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:50.320\n Compute this little teeny spot takes all the mass\n\n1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:53.440\n in the local one light year by one light year space.\n\n1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:54.960\n It's close enough to infinite.\n\n1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.840\n Well, it's a heck of a computer if it is one.\n\n1:01:56.840 --> 1:01:57.520\n I know.\n\n1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:01.040\n It's a weird description, because the simulation\n\n1:02:01.040 --> 1:02:04.880\n description seems to break when you look closely at it.\n\n1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:08.800\n But the rules of the universe seem to imply something's up.\n\n1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:10.880\n That seems a little arbitrary.\n\n1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:14.920\n The universe, the whole thing, the laws of physics,\n\n1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:20.120\n it just seems like, how did it come out to be the way it is?\n\n1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:22.640\n Well, lots of people talk about that.\n\n1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:24.440\n Like I said, the two smartest groups of humans\n\n1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:26.120\n are working on the same problem.\n\n1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:27.120\n From different aspects.\n\n1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:29.560\n And they're both complete failures.\n\n1:02:29.560 --> 1:02:32.160\n So that's kind of cool.\n\n1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:34.800\n They might succeed eventually.\n\n1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:37.680\n Well, after 2,000 years, the trend isn't good.\n\n1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:39.640\n Oh, 2,000 years is nothing in the span\n\n1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:40.920\n of the history of the universe.\n\n1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:41.560\n That's for sure.\n\n1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:42.800\n We have some time.\n\n1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:46.720\n But the next 1,000 years doesn't look good either.\n\n1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:48.360\n That's what everybody says at every stage.\n\n1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.840\n But with Moore's law, as you've just described,\n\n1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:54.680\n not being dead, the exponential growth of technology,\n\n1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:57.360\n the future seems pretty incredible.\n\n1:02:57.360 --> 1:02:59.160\n Well, it'll be interesting, that's for sure.\n\n1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:00.120\n That's right.\n\n1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:03.640\n So what are your thoughts on Ray Kurzweil's sense\n\n1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:05.640\n that exponential improvement in technology\n\n1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:07.120\n will continue indefinitely?\n\n1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:09.920\n Is that how you see Moore's law?\n\n1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:12.720\n Do you see Moore's law more broadly,\n\n1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:15.960\n in the sense that technology of all kinds\n\n1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:20.320\n has a way of stacking S curves on top of each other,\n\n1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:24.440\n where it'll be exponential, and then we'll see all kinds of...\n\n1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:27.600\n What does an exponential of a million mean?\n\n1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:29.400\n That's a pretty amazing number.\n\n1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:32.160\n And that's just for a local little piece of silicon.\n\n1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:35.080\n Now let's imagine you, say, decided\n\n1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:41.520\n to get 1,000 tons of silicon to collaborate in one computer\n\n1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:44.720\n at a million times the density.\n\n1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:47.840\n Now you're talking, I don't know, 10 to the 20th more\n\n1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:51.720\n computation power than our current, already unbelievably\n\n1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:54.200\n fast computers.\n\n1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:55.760\n Nobody knows what that's going to mean.\n\n1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:58.960\n The sci fi guys call it computronium,\n\n1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:02.720\n like when a local civilization turns the nearby star\n\n1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:05.120\n into a computer.\n\n1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:06.720\n I don't know if that's true, but...\n\n1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:11.520\n So just even when you shrink a transistor, the...\n\n1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:12.560\n That's only one dimension.\n\n1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:14.280\n The ripple effects of that.\n\n1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:17.600\n People tend to think about computers as a cost problem.\n\n1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:20.560\n So computers are made out of silicon and minor amounts\n\n1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:24.800\n of metals and this and that.\n\n1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:27.520\n None of those things cost any money.\n\n1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:30.080\n There's plenty of sand.\n\n1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:32.320\n You could just turn the beach and a little bit of ocean water\n\n1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:33.360\n into computers.\n\n1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:36.720\n So all the cost is in the equipment to do it.\n\n1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:39.120\n And the trend on equipment is once you\n\n1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:40.640\n figure out how to build the equipment,\n\n1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:41.800\n the trend of cost is zero.\n\n1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:44.160\n Elon said, first you figure out what\n\n1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:47.560\n configuration you want the atoms in,\n\n1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:50.320\n and then how to put them there.\n\n1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:55.320\n His great insight is people are how constrained.\n\n1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:58.720\n I have this thing, I know how it works,\n\n1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:02.320\n and then little tweaks to that will generate something,\n\n1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:05.160\n as opposed to what do I actually want,\n\n1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:07.080\n and then figure out how to build it.\n\n1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:09.280\n It's a very different mindset.\n\n1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.360\n And almost nobody has it, obviously.\n\n1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:15.760\n Well, let me ask on that topic,\n\n1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:18.080\n you were one of the key early people\n\n1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:21.040\n in the development of autopilot, at least in the hardware\n\n1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:24.480\n side, Elon Musk believes that autopilot\n\n1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:26.720\n and vehicle autonomy, if you just look at that problem,\n\n1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:29.480\n can follow this kind of exponential improvement.\n\n1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:32.600\n In terms of the how question that we're talking about,\n\n1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:34.680\n there's no reason why you can't.\n\n1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:37.320\n What are your thoughts on this particular space\n\n1:05:37.320 --> 1:05:42.320\n of vehicle autonomy, and your part of it\n\n1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:45.280\n and Elon Musk's and Tesla's vision for vehicle autonomy?\n\n1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:48.760\n Well, the computer you need to build is straightforward.\n\n1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:51.160\n And you could argue, well, does it need to be\n\n1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:53.600\n two times faster or five times or 10 times?\n\n1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:58.440\n But that's just a matter of time or price in the short run.\n\n1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:00.240\n So that's not a big deal.\n\n1:06:00.240 --> 1:06:03.280\n You don't have to be especially smart to drive a car.\n\n1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:05.720\n So it's not like a super hard problem.\n\n1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:07.960\n I mean, the big problem with safety is attention,\n\n1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:11.120\n which computers are really good at, not skills.\n\n1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:15.280\n Well, let me push back on one.\n\n1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:17.160\n You see, everything you said is correct,\n\n1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:22.160\n but we as humans tend to take for granted\n\n1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:26.880\n how incredible our vision system is.\n\n1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:30.640\n So you can drive a car with 20, 50 vision,\n\n1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:33.080\n and you can train a neural network to extract\n\n1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:36.480\n the distance of any object in the shape of any surface\n\n1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:38.560\n from a video and data.\n\n1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:40.200\n Yeah, but that's really simple.\n\n1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:42.120\n No, it's not simple.\n\n1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:44.400\n That's a simple data problem.\n\n1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:46.320\n It's not, it's not simple.\n\n1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:50.480\n It's because it's not just detecting objects,\n\n1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:52.280\n it's understanding the scene,\n\n1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.320\n and it's being able to do it in a way\n\n1:06:54.320 --> 1:06:56.600\n that doesn't make errors.\n\n1:06:56.600 --> 1:07:00.040\n So the beautiful thing about the human vision system\n\n1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:02.600\n and our entire brain around the whole thing\n\n1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:05.520\n is we're able to fill in the gaps.\n\n1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:08.200\n It's not just about perfectly detecting cars.\n\n1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:09.960\n It's inferring the occluded cars.\n\n1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:12.400\n It's trying to, it's understanding the physics.\n\n1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:14.600\n I think that's mostly a data problem.\n\n1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:17.680\n So you think what data would compute\n\n1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:19.220\n with improvement of computation\n\n1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:20.800\n with improvement in collection of data?\n\n1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:22.640\n Well, there is a, you know, when you're driving a car\n\n1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:24.760\n and somebody cuts you off, your brain has theories\n\n1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:26.160\n about why they did it.\n\n1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:28.640\n You know, they're a bad person, they're distracted,\n\n1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:32.820\n they're dumb, you know, you can listen to yourself, right?\n\n1:07:32.820 --> 1:07:37.040\n So, you know, if you think that narrative is important\n\n1:07:37.040 --> 1:07:38.840\n to be able to successfully drive a car,\n\n1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:41.640\n then current autopilot systems can't do it.\n\n1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:44.360\n But if cars are ballistic things with tracks\n\n1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:47.320\n and probabilistic changes of speed and direction,\n\n1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:50.200\n and roads are fixed and given, by the way,\n\n1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:53.280\n they don't change dynamically, right?\n\n1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:56.320\n You can map the world really thoroughly.\n\n1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:59.620\n You can place every object really thoroughly.\n\n1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:03.040\n Right, you can calculate trajectories\n\n1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:06.400\n of things really thoroughly, right?\n\n1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:09.840\n But everything you said about really thoroughly\n\n1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:13.120\n has a different degree of difficulty, so.\n\n1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:15.080\n And you could say at some point,\n\n1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:17.640\n computer autonomous systems will be way better\n\n1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:20.040\n at things that humans are lousy at.\n\n1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:22.480\n Like, they'll be better at attention,\n\n1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:25.040\n they'll always remember there was a pothole in the road\n\n1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:27.360\n that humans keep forgetting about,\n\n1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.440\n they'll remember that this set of roads\n\n1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:31.200\n has these weirdo lines on it\n\n1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:32.800\n that the computers figured out once,\n\n1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:35.160\n and especially if they get updates,\n\n1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:38.000\n so if somebody changes a given,\n\n1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.280\n like, the key to robots and stuff somebody said\n\n1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:44.360\n is to maximize the givens, right?\n\n1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:45.200\n Right.\n\n1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:47.960\n So having a robot pick up this bottle cap\n\n1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:51.000\n is way easier if you put a red dot on the top,\n\n1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:52.680\n because then you'll have to figure out,\n\n1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:54.840\n and if you wanna do a certain thing with it,\n\n1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:57.160\n maximize the givens is the thing.\n\n1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:01.040\n And autonomous systems are happily maximizing the givens.\n\n1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:04.160\n Like, humans, when you drive someplace new,\n\n1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:06.200\n you remember it, because you're processing it\n\n1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:08.920\n the whole time, and after the 50th time you drove to work,\n\n1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:11.480\n you get to work, you don't know how you got there, right?\n\n1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:14.840\n You're on autopilot, right?\n\n1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:17.800\n Autonomous cars are always on autopilot.\n\n1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:20.360\n But the cars have no theories about why they got cut off,\n\n1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:22.140\n or why they're in traffic.\n\n1:09:22.140 --> 1:09:24.720\n So they also never stop paying attention.\n\n1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:28.000\n Right, so I tend to believe you do have to have theories,\n\n1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000\n meta models of other people,\n\n1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.420\n especially with pedestrian cyclists,\n\n1:09:31.420 --> 1:09:32.840\n but also with other cars.\n\n1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:37.840\n So everything you said is actually essential to driving.\n\n1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:41.760\n Driving is a lot more complicated than people realize,\n\n1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:44.640\n I think, so to push back slightly, but to...\n\n1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.480\n So to cut into traffic, right?\n\n1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:47.320\n Yep.\n\n1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:48.460\n You can't just wait for a gap,\n\n1:09:48.460 --> 1:09:50.280\n you have to be somewhat aggressive.\n\n1:09:50.280 --> 1:09:53.840\n You'll be surprised how simple a calculation for that is.\n\n1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:55.540\n I may be on that particular point,\n\n1:09:55.540 --> 1:10:00.360\n but there's, maybe I actually have to push back.\n\n1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:01.640\n I would be surprised.\n\n1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:03.080\n You know what, yeah, I'll just say where I stand.\n\n1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:04.280\n I would be very surprised,\n\n1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:08.700\n but I think you might be surprised how complicated it is.\n\n1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:12.640\n I tell people, progress disappoints in the short run,\n\n1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:13.960\n and surprises in the long run.\n\n1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:15.600\n It's very possible, yeah.\n\n1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:19.000\n I suspect in 10 years it'll be just taken for granted.\n\n1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:19.880\n Yeah, probably.\n\n1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:22.080\n But you're probably right, not look like...\n\n1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:25.080\n It's gonna be a $50 solution that nobody cares about.\n\n1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:27.280\n It's like GPSes, like, wow, GPSes.\n\n1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:29.460\n We have satellites in space\n\n1:10:29.460 --> 1:10:31.120\n that tell you where your location is.\n\n1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:33.480\n It was a really big deal, now everything has a GPS in it.\n\n1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:36.040\n Yeah, that's true, but I do think that systems\n\n1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:39.880\n that involve human behavior are more complicated\n\n1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:40.820\n than we give them credit for.\n\n1:10:40.820 --> 1:10:43.520\n So we can do incredible things with technology\n\n1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:45.560\n that don't involve humans, but when you...\n\n1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:48.440\n I think humans are less complicated than people.\n\n1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.560\n You know, frequently ascribed.\n\n1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:51.400\n Maybe I feel...\n\n1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:53.720\n We tend to operate out of large numbers of patterns\n\n1:10:53.720 --> 1:10:55.820\n and just keep doing it over and over.\n\n1:10:55.820 --> 1:10:58.040\n But I can't trust you because you're a human.\n\n1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:00.760\n That's something a human would say.\n\n1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:04.600\n But my hope is on the point you've made is,\n\n1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:07.260\n even if, no matter who's right,\n\n1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:10.660\n I'm hoping that there's a lot of things\n\n1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:11.880\n that humans aren't good at\n\n1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:13.460\n that machines are definitely good at,\n\n1:11:13.460 --> 1:11:15.640\n like you said, attention and things like that.\n\n1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:17.680\n Well, they'll be so much better\n\n1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:21.000\n that the overall picture of safety and autonomy\n\n1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:22.880\n will be, obviously cars will be safer,\n\n1:11:22.880 --> 1:11:24.720\n even if they're not as good at understanding.\n\n1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:26.400\n I'm a big believer in safety.\n\n1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:29.640\n I mean, there are already the current safety systems,\n\n1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:32.040\n like cruise control that doesn't let you run into people\n\n1:11:32.040 --> 1:11:33.360\n and lane keeping.\n\n1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:34.680\n There are so many features\n\n1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:37.760\n that you just look at the parade of accidents\n\n1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:42.480\n and knocking off like 80% of them is super doable.\n\n1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:44.680\n Just to linger on the autopilot team\n\n1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:45.880\n and the efforts there,\n\n1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.720\n it seems to be that there's a very intense scrutiny\n\n1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:54.320\n by the media and the public in terms of safety,\n\n1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:58.000\n the pressure, the bar put before autonomous vehicles.\n\n1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.760\n What are your, sort of as a person there\n\n1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:03.900\n working on the hardware and trying to build a system\n\n1:12:03.900 --> 1:12:07.240\n that builds a safe vehicle and so on,\n\n1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:08.960\n what was your sense about that pressure?\n\n1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:09.920\n Is it unfair?\n\n1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:12.320\n Is it expected of new technology?\n\n1:12:12.320 --> 1:12:13.540\n Yeah, it seems reasonable.\n\n1:12:13.540 --> 1:12:15.440\n I was interested, I talked to both American\n\n1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:17.280\n and European regulators,\n\n1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:21.240\n and I was worried that the regulations\n\n1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:25.120\n would write into the rules technology solutions,\n\n1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:30.040\n like modern brake systems imply hydraulic brakes.\n\n1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:32.160\n So if you read the regulations,\n\n1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:35.100\n to meet the letter of the law for brakes,\n\n1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:37.800\n it sort of has to be hydraulic, right?\n\n1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:42.060\n And the regulator said they're interested in the use cases,\n\n1:12:42.060 --> 1:12:44.360\n like a head on crash, an offset crash,\n\n1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:47.100\n don't hit pedestrians, don't run into people,\n\n1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:50.400\n don't leave the road, don't run a red light or a stoplight.\n\n1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:53.160\n They were very much into the scenarios.\n\n1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:56.920\n And they had all the data about which scenarios\n\n1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:59.320\n injured or killed the most people.\n\n1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:04.040\n And for the most part, those conversations were like,\n\n1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:08.800\n what's the right thing to do to take the next step?\n\n1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:12.000\n Now, Elon's very interested also in the benefits\n\n1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.160\n of autonomous driving or freeing people's time\n\n1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:16.520\n and attention, as well as safety.\n\n1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:20.340\n And I think that's also an interesting thing,\n\n1:13:20.340 --> 1:13:25.160\n but building autonomous systems so they're safe\n\n1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:27.400\n and safer than people seemed,\n\n1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:30.160\n since the goal is to be 10X safer than people,\n\n1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:32.200\n having the bar to be safer than people\n\n1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:37.200\n and scrutinizing accidents seems philosophically correct.\n\n1:13:39.260 --> 1:13:41.000\n So I think that's a good thing.\n\n1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:46.000\n What are, is different than the things you worked at,\n\n1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:51.000\n Intel, AMD, Apple, with autopilot chip design\n\n1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:54.320\n and hardware design, what are interesting\n\n1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:56.680\n or challenging aspects of building this specialized\n\n1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:59.340\n kind of computing system in the automotive space?\n\n1:14:00.300 --> 1:14:01.640\n I mean, there's two tricks to building\n\n1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:02.780\n like an automotive computer.\n\n1:14:02.780 --> 1:14:07.320\n One is the software team, the machine learning team\n\n1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:10.640\n is developing algorithms that are changing fast.\n\n1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:14.280\n So as you're building the accelerator,\n\n1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:16.920\n you have this, you know, worry or intuition\n\n1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:18.520\n that the algorithms will change enough\n\n1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:22.640\n that the accelerator will be the wrong one, right?\n\n1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:25.000\n And there's the generic thing, which is,\n\n1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.240\n if you build a really good general purpose computer,\n\n1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:31.440\n say its performance is one, and then GPU guys\n\n1:14:31.440 --> 1:14:34.280\n will deliver about 5X to performance\n\n1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:35.720\n for the same amount of silicon,\n\n1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:37.640\n because instead of discovering parallelism,\n\n1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:39.240\n you're given parallelism.\n\n1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:43.720\n And then special accelerators get another two to 5X\n\n1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:46.040\n on top of a GPU, because you say,\n\n1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:49.040\n I know the math is always eight bit integers\n\n1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:52.200\n into 32 bit accumulators, and the operations\n\n1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:55.200\n are the subset of mathematical possibilities.\n\n1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:00.200\n So AI accelerators have a claimed performance benefit\n\n1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:05.080\n over GPUs because in the narrow math space,\n\n1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:07.100\n you're nailing the algorithm.\n\n1:15:07.100 --> 1:15:10.040\n Now, you still try to make it programmable,\n\n1:15:10.040 --> 1:15:13.280\n but the AI field is changing really fast.\n\n1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:15.760\n So there's a, you know, there's a little\n\n1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:18.520\n creative tension there of, I want the acceleration\n\n1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:22.160\n afforded by specialization without being over specialized\n\n1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:25.600\n so that the new algorithm is so much more effective\n\n1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:27.960\n that you'd have been better off on a GPU.\n\n1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:30.000\n So there's a tension there.\n\n1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000\n To build a good computer for an application\n\n1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:36.240\n like automotive, there's all kinds of sensor inputs\n\n1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:39.120\n and safety processors and a bunch of stuff.\n\n1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:42.240\n So one of Elon's goals is to make it super affordable.\n\n1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.840\n So every car gets an autopilot computer.\n\n1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:46.520\n So some of the recent startups you look at,\n\n1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:48.360\n and they have a server in the trunk,\n\n1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:49.680\n because they're saying, I'm gonna build\n\n1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:52.540\n this autopilot computer, replaces the driver.\n\n1:15:52.540 --> 1:15:55.240\n So their cost budget's 10 or $20,000.\n\n1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.780\n And Elon's constraint was, I'm gonna put one in every car,\n\n1:15:58.780 --> 1:16:01.720\n whether people buy autonomous driving or not.\n\n1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:05.260\n So the cost constraint he had in mind was great, right?\n\n1:16:05.260 --> 1:16:08.400\n And to hit that, you had to think about the system design.\n\n1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:09.880\n That's complicated, and it's fun.\n\n1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:12.560\n You know, it's like, it's like, it's craftsman's work.\n\n1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:14.240\n Like, you know, a violin maker, right?\n\n1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:16.800\n You can say, Stradivarius is this incredible thing,\n\n1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:18.480\n the musicians are incredible.\n\n1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:20.480\n But the guy making the violin, you know,\n\n1:16:20.480 --> 1:16:24.000\n picked wood and sanded it, and then he cut it,\n\n1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:25.960\n you know, and he glued it, you know,\n\n1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:27.920\n and he waited for the right day\n\n1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:29.520\n so that when he put the finish on it,\n\n1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:31.640\n it didn't, you know, do something dumb.\n\n1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:33.880\n That's craftsman's work, right?\n\n1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:35.520\n You may be a genius craftsman\n\n1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:36.840\n because you have the best techniques\n\n1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:38.840\n and you discover a new one,\n\n1:16:38.840 --> 1:16:41.960\n but most engineers, craftsman's work.\n\n1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:44.320\n And humans really like to do that.\n\n1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:45.140\n You know the expression?\n\n1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:45.980\n Smart humans.\n\n1:16:45.980 --> 1:16:46.820\n No, everybody.\n\n1:16:46.820 --> 1:16:47.660\n All humans.\n\n1:16:47.660 --> 1:16:48.480\n I don't know.\n\n1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:50.360\n I used to, I dug ditches when I was in college.\n\n1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:51.440\n I got really good at it.\n\n1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:52.620\n Satisfying.\n\n1:16:52.620 --> 1:16:53.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:53.460 --> 1:16:54.280\n So.\n\n1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:55.480\n Digging ditches is also craftsman's work.\n\n1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:56.960\n Yeah, of course.\n\n1:16:56.960 --> 1:17:00.920\n So there's an expression called complex mastery behavior.\n\n1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:02.080\n So when you're learning something,\n\n1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:04.080\n that's fine, because you're learning something.\n\n1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:05.760\n When you do something, it's relatively simple.\n\n1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:06.700\n It's not that satisfying.\n\n1:17:06.700 --> 1:17:10.360\n But if the steps that you have to do are complicated\n\n1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:13.500\n and you're good at them, it's satisfying to do them.\n\n1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:16.880\n And then if you're intrigued by it all,\n\n1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:19.520\n as you're doing them, you sometimes learn new things\n\n1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:21.600\n that you can raise your game.\n\n1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:23.760\n But craftsman's work is good.\n\n1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:27.080\n And engineers, like engineering is complicated enough\n\n1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:28.800\n that you have to learn a lot of skills.\n\n1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:32.360\n And then a lot of what you do is then craftsman's work,\n\n1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:33.480\n which is fun.\n\n1:17:33.480 --> 1:17:37.040\n Autonomous driving, building a very resource\n\n1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:37.880\n constrained computer.\n\n1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:39.520\n So a computer has to be cheap enough\n\n1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:41.100\n to put in every single car.\n\n1:17:41.100 --> 1:17:45.040\n That essentially boils down to craftsman's work.\n\n1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:45.880\n It's engineering, it's innovation.\n\n1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:47.680\n Yeah, you know, there's thoughtful decisions\n\n1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:50.560\n and problems to solve and trade offs to make.\n\n1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:52.480\n Do you need 10 camera and ports or eight?\n\n1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:54.520\n You know, you're building for the current car\n\n1:17:54.520 --> 1:17:56.000\n or the next one.\n\n1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:57.880\n You know, how do you do the safety stuff?\n\n1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:00.600\n You know, there's a whole bunch of details.\n\n1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:01.440\n But it's fun.\n\n1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:04.760\n It's not like I'm building a new type of neural network,\n\n1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:08.040\n which has a new mathematics and a new computer to work.\n\n1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:11.520\n You know, that's like, there's more invention than that.\n\n1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:14.120\n But the rejection to practice,\n\n1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:16.120\n once you pick the architecture, you look inside\n\n1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:17.080\n and what do you see?\n\n1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:20.360\n Adders and multipliers and memories and, you know,\n\n1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:21.200\n the basics.\n\n1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:25.640\n So computers is always this weird set of abstraction layers\n\n1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:29.360\n of ideas and thinking that reduction to practice\n\n1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:33.800\n is transistors and wires and, you know, pretty basic stuff.\n\n1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:37.080\n And that's an interesting phenomenon.\n\n1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:38.800\n By the way, like factory work,\n\n1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:40.600\n like lots of people think factory work\n\n1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:42.280\n is road assembly stuff.\n\n1:18:42.280 --> 1:18:44.160\n I've been on the assembly line.\n\n1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.280\n Like the people who work there really like it.\n\n1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:47.880\n It's a really great job.\n\n1:18:47.880 --> 1:18:48.760\n It's really complicated.\n\n1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:50.920\n Putting cars together is hard, right?\n\n1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:53.440\n And the car is moving and the parts are moving\n\n1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:55.000\n and sometimes the parts are damaged\n\n1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.560\n and you have to coordinate putting all the stuff together\n\n1:18:57.560 --> 1:18:59.080\n and people are good at it.\n\n1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:00.360\n They're good at it.\n\n1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:01.760\n And I remember one day I went to work\n\n1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:03.920\n and the line was shut down for some reason\n\n1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:06.760\n and some of the guys sitting around were really bummed\n\n1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:09.240\n because they had reorganized a bunch of stuff\n\n1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:10.720\n and they were gonna hit a new record\n\n1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:12.720\n for the number of cars built that day.\n\n1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:14.160\n And they were all gung ho to do it.\n\n1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:15.680\n And these were big, tough buggers.\n\n1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:19.200\n And, you know, but what they did was complicated\n\n1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:20.200\n and you couldn't do it.\n\n1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:21.360\n Yeah, and I mean.\n\n1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:22.760\n Well, after a while you could,\n\n1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:24.200\n but you'd have to work your way up\n\n1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:27.240\n because, you know, like putting the bright,\n\n1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:30.960\n what's called the brights, the trim on a car\n\n1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:32.600\n on a moving assembly line\n\n1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:34.560\n where it has to be attached 25 places\n\n1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:38.160\n in a minute and a half is unbelievably complicated.\n\n1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:42.480\n And human beings can do it, it's really good.\n\n1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:45.240\n I think that's harder than driving a car, by the way.\n\n1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:47.040\n Putting together, working at a.\n\n1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:48.560\n Working on a factory.\n\n1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:51.360\n Two smart people can disagree.\n\n1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:52.200\n Yay.\n\n1:19:52.200 --> 1:19:54.440\n I think driving a car.\n\n1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:56.120\n We'll get you in the factory someday\n\n1:19:56.120 --> 1:19:57.400\n and then we'll see how you do.\n\n1:19:57.400 --> 1:19:59.480\n No, not for us humans driving a car is easy.\n\n1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:03.040\n I'm saying building a machine that drives a car\n\n1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:04.280\n is not easy.\n\n1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:05.120\n No, okay.\n\n1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:05.960\n Okay.\n\n1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:07.400\n Driving a car is easy for humans\n\n1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:10.800\n because we've been evolving for billions of years.\n\n1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:11.640\n Drive cars.\n\n1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:13.280\n Yeah, I noticed that.\n\n1:20:13.280 --> 1:20:15.600\n The pale of the cars are super cool.\n\n1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:18.720\n No, now you join the rest of the internet\n\n1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:19.840\n and mocking me.\n\n1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:20.680\n Okay.\n\n1:20:20.680 --> 1:20:22.840\n I wasn't mocking, I was just.\n\n1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:23.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:26.800\n Intrigued by your anthropology.\n\n1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:27.640\n Yeah, it's.\n\n1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:28.960\n I'll have to go dig into that.\n\n1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:31.080\n There's some inaccuracies there, yes.\n\n1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:33.480\n Okay, but in general,\n\n1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:38.760\n what have you learned in terms of\n\n1:20:39.640 --> 1:20:44.000\n thinking about passion, craftsmanship,\n\n1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.200\n tension, chaos.\n\n1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:48.040\n Jesus.\n\n1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.880\n The whole mess of it.\n\n1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:54.240\n What have you learned, have taken away from your time\n\n1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:57.000\n working with Elon Musk, working at Tesla,\n\n1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:02.000\n which is known to be a place of chaos innovation,\n\n1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:03.640\n craftsmanship, and all of those things.\n\n1:21:03.640 --> 1:21:06.000\n I really like the way you thought.\n\n1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:07.680\n You think you have an understanding\n\n1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:10.000\n about what first principles of something is,\n\n1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.640\n and then you talk to Elon about it,\n\n1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:13.920\n and you didn't scratch the surface.\n\n1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:18.360\n He has a deep belief that no matter what you do,\n\n1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:21.200\n it's a local maximum, right?\n\n1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:24.280\n And I had a friend, he invented a better electric motor,\n\n1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:26.960\n and it was a lot better than what we were using.\n\n1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:28.080\n And one day he came by, he said,\n\n1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:31.920\n I'm a little disappointed, because this is really great,\n\n1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:33.280\n and you didn't seem that impressed.\n\n1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:37.280\n And I said, when the super intelligent aliens come,\n\n1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:38.960\n are they going to be looking for you?\n\n1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:39.800\n Like, where is he?\n\n1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:41.920\n The guy who built the motor.\n\n1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:42.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:43.600\n Probably not.\n\n1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:48.320\n You know, like, but doing interesting work\n\n1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:49.840\n that's both innovative and, let's say,\n\n1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:51.800\n craftsman's work on the current thing\n\n1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:54.200\n is really satisfying, and it's good.\n\n1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:55.120\n And that's cool.\n\n1:21:55.120 --> 1:21:59.000\n And then Elon was good at taking everything apart,\n\n1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.640\n and like, what's the deep first principle?\n\n1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:03.920\n Oh, no, what's really, no, what's really?\n\n1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:08.920\n You know, that ability to look at it without assumptions\n\n1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:13.680\n and how constraints is super wild.\n\n1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:17.240\n You know, he built a rocket ship, and an electric car,\n\n1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:18.360\n and you know, everything.\n\n1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:21.280\n And that's super fun, and he's into it, too.\n\n1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:25.600\n Like, when they first landed two SpaceX rockets at Tesla,\n\n1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.440\n we had a video projector in the big room,\n\n1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:29.280\n and like, 500 people came down,\n\n1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:30.760\n and when they landed, everybody cheered,\n\n1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:32.120\n and some people cried.\n\n1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:33.200\n It was so cool.\n\n1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:35.720\n All right, but how did you do that?\n\n1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:40.720\n Well, it was super hard, and then people say,\n\n1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:42.560\n well, it's chaotic, really?\n\n1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:44.160\n To get out of all your assumptions,\n\n1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:46.720\n you think that's not gonna be unbelievably painful?\n\n1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:49.640\n And is Elon tough?\n\n1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:50.960\n Yeah, probably.\n\n1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:52.840\n Do people look back on it and say,\n\n1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:57.080\n boy, I'm really happy I had that experience\n\n1:22:57.080 --> 1:23:01.280\n to go take apart that many layers of assumptions?\n\n1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:04.920\n Sometimes super fun, sometimes painful.\n\n1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:07.920\n So it could be emotionally and intellectually painful,\n\n1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:10.880\n that whole process of just stripping away assumptions.\n\n1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:13.360\n Yeah, imagine 99% of your thought process\n\n1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:15.400\n is protecting your self conception,\n\n1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:18.680\n and 98% of that's wrong.\n\n1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:21.560\n Now you got the math right.\n\n1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:23.680\n How do you think you're feeling\n\n1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:26.840\n when you get back into that one bit that's useful,\n\n1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:27.760\n and now you're open,\n\n1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:30.680\n and you have the ability to do something different?\n\n1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:33.640\n I don't know if I got the math right.\n\n1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:37.400\n It might be 99.9, but it ain't 50.\n\n1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:42.280\n Imagining it, the 50% is hard enough.\n\n1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:47.160\n Now, for a long time, I've suspected you could get better.\n\n1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:50.720\n Like you can think better, you can think more clearly,\n\n1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:52.040\n you can take things apart.\n\n1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:56.400\n And there's lots of examples of that, people who do that.\n\n1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.400\n And Nilan is an example of that, you are an example.\n\n1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:05.480\n I don't know if I am, I'm fun to talk to.\n\n1:24:06.520 --> 1:24:07.360\n Certainly.\n\n1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:09.000\n I've learned a lot of stuff.\n\n1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.960\n Well, here's the other thing, I joke, like I read books,\n\n1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:14.560\n and people think, oh, you read books.\n\n1:24:14.560 --> 1:24:19.560\n Well, no, I've read a couple of books a week for 55 years.\n\n1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:21.520\n Well, maybe 50,\n\n1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:24.640\n because I didn't learn to read until I was age or something.\n\n1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:28.480\n And it turns out when people write books,\n\n1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:31.240\n they often take 20 years of their life\n\n1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:33.280\n where they passionately did something,\n\n1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:36.080\n reduce it to 200 pages.\n\n1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:37.440\n That's kind of fun.\n\n1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:38.960\n And then you go online,\n\n1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:41.080\n and you can find out who wrote the best books\n\n1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:43.360\n and who liked, you know, that's kind of wild.\n\n1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:45.200\n So there's this wild selection process,\n\n1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:46.040\n and then you can read it,\n\n1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:48.600\n and for the most part, understand it.\n\n1:24:49.840 --> 1:24:51.920\n And then you can go apply it.\n\n1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:53.000\n Like I went to one company,\n\n1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.080\n I thought, I haven't managed much before.\n\n1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:57.280\n So I read 20 management books,\n\n1:24:57.280 --> 1:24:58.720\n and I started talking to them,\n\n1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:01.400\n and basically compared to all the VPs running around,\n\n1:25:01.400 --> 1:25:05.360\n I'd read 19 more management books than anybody else.\n\n1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:08.600\n It wasn't even that hard.\n\n1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:11.160\n And half the stuff worked, like first time.\n\n1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:12.600\n It wasn't even rocket science.\n\n1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:16.960\n But at the core of that is questioning the assumptions,\n\n1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:20.000\n or sort of entering the thinking,\n\n1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:21.760\n first principles thinking,\n\n1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:24.880\n sort of looking at the reality of the situation,\n\n1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:28.240\n and using that knowledge, applying that knowledge.\n\n1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:29.080\n So that's.\n\n1:25:29.080 --> 1:25:31.400\n So I would say my brain has this idea\n\n1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:34.280\n that you can question first assumptions.\n\n1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:38.320\n But I can go days at a time and forget that,\n\n1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:41.480\n and you have to kind of like circle back that observation.\n\n1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:45.200\n Because it is emotionally challenging.\n\n1:25:45.200 --> 1:25:47.360\n Well, it's hard to just keep it front and center,\n\n1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:50.440\n because you operate on so many levels all the time,\n\n1:25:50.440 --> 1:25:53.480\n and getting this done takes priority,\n\n1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:56.560\n or being happy takes priority,\n\n1:25:56.560 --> 1:25:59.400\n or screwing around takes priority.\n\n1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:03.080\n Like how you go through life is complicated.\n\n1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:04.400\n And then you remember, oh yeah,\n\n1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:06.600\n I could really think first principles.\n\n1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:08.280\n Oh shit, that's tiring.\n\n1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:12.760\n But you do for a while, and that's kind of cool.\n\n1:26:12.760 --> 1:26:16.200\n So just as a last question in your sense,\n\n1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:19.480\n from the big picture, from the first principles,\n\n1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:21.520\n do you think, you kind of answered it already,\n\n1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:25.000\n but do you think autonomous driving is something\n\n1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:28.720\n we can solve on a timeline of years?\n\n1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:32.240\n So one, two, three, five, 10 years,\n\n1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:33.880\n as opposed to a century?\n\n1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:35.400\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:37.440\n Just to linger on it a little longer,\n\n1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:40.120\n where's the confidence coming from?\n\n1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:42.640\n Is it the fundamentals of the problem,\n\n1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:46.420\n the fundamentals of building the hardware and the software?\n\n1:26:46.420 --> 1:26:50.680\n As a computational problem, understanding ballistics,\n\n1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:55.680\n roles, topography, it seems pretty solvable.\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:59.760\n And you can see this, like speech recognition,\n\n1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:01.720\n for a long time people are doing frequency\n\n1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:04.400\n and domain analysis, and all kinds of stuff,\n\n1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:07.280\n and that didn't work at all, right?\n\n1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:09.360\n And then they did deep learning about it,\n\n1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:10.400\n and it worked great.\n\n1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:13.520\n And it took multiple iterations.\n\n1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:18.160\n And autonomous driving is way past\n\n1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:19.860\n the frequency analysis point.\n\n1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:23.900\n Use radar, don't run into things.\n\n1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:25.440\n And the data gathering's going up,\n\n1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:26.840\n and the computation's going up,\n\n1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:28.640\n and the algorithm understanding's going up,\n\n1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:30.020\n and there's a whole bunch of problems\n\n1:27:30.020 --> 1:27:32.000\n getting solved like that.\n\n1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.520\n The data side is really powerful,\n\n1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:35.760\n but I disagree with both you and Elon.\n\n1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:38.600\n I'll tell Elon once again, as I did before,\n\n1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:42.400\n that when you add human beings into the picture,\n\n1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:45.680\n it's no longer a ballistics problem.\n\n1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:47.480\n It's something more complicated,\n\n1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:50.360\n but I could be very well proven wrong.\n\n1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:53.020\n Cars are highly damped in terms of rate of change.\n\n1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:56.640\n Like the steering system's really slow\n\n1:27:56.640 --> 1:27:57.640\n compared to a computer.\n\n1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:01.000\n The acceleration of the acceleration's really slow.\n\n1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:04.160\n Yeah, on a certain timescale, on a ballistics timescale,\n\n1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:05.760\n but human behavior, I don't know.\n\n1:28:07.340 --> 1:28:08.180\n I shouldn't say.\n\n1:28:08.180 --> 1:28:09.780\n Human beings are really slow too.\n\n1:28:09.780 --> 1:28:13.960\n Weirdly, we operate half a second behind reality.\n\n1:28:13.960 --> 1:28:15.300\n Nobody really understands that one either.\n\n1:28:15.300 --> 1:28:16.440\n It's pretty funny.\n\n1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:18.160\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:23.600\n We very well could be surprised,\n\n1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:25.160\n and I think with the rate of improvement\n\n1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:26.880\n in all aspects on both the compute\n\n1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:29.680\n and the software and the hardware,\n\n1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:32.560\n there's gonna be pleasant surprises all over the place.\n\n1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:36.720\n Speaking of unpleasant surprises,\n\n1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:39.520\n many people have worries about a singularity\n\n1:28:39.520 --> 1:28:41.680\n in the development of AI.\n\n1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:43.160\n Forgive me for such questions.\n\n1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:44.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:46.040\n When AI improves the exponential\n\n1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:48.360\n and reaches a point of superhuman level\n\n1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:52.040\n general intelligence, beyond the point,\n\n1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:53.320\n there's no looking back.\n\n1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:56.120\n Do you share this worry of existential threats\n\n1:28:56.120 --> 1:28:57.380\n from artificial intelligence,\n\n1:28:57.380 --> 1:29:00.780\n from computers becoming superhuman level intelligent?\n\n1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:02.880\n No, not really.\n\n1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:07.540\n We already have a very stratified society,\n\n1:29:07.540 --> 1:29:09.400\n and then if you look at the whole animal kingdom\n\n1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:12.560\n of capabilities and abilities and interests,\n\n1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:15.280\n and smart people have their niche,\n\n1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:17.760\n and normal people have their niche,\n\n1:29:17.760 --> 1:29:19.640\n and craftsmen have their niche,\n\n1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:22.520\n and animals have their niche.\n\n1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:26.000\n I suspect that the domains of interest\n\n1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:29.440\n for things that are astronomically different,\n\n1:29:29.440 --> 1:29:32.280\n like the whole something got 10 times smarter than us\n\n1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:34.680\n and wanted to track us all down because what?\n\n1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:36.920\n We like to have coffee at Starbucks?\n\n1:29:36.920 --> 1:29:38.880\n Like, it doesn't seem plausible.\n\n1:29:38.880 --> 1:29:40.680\n No, is there an existential problem\n\n1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:42.520\n that how do you live in a world\n\n1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:44.080\n where there's something way smarter than you,\n\n1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:46.400\n and you based your kind of self esteem\n\n1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:48.880\n on being the smartest local person?\n\n1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:52.520\n Well, there's what, 0.1% of the population who thinks that?\n\n1:29:52.520 --> 1:29:54.840\n Because the rest of the population's been dealing with it\n\n1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:56.720\n since they were born.\n\n1:29:56.720 --> 1:30:00.940\n So the breadth of possible experience\n\n1:30:00.940 --> 1:30:03.660\n that can be interesting is really big.\n\n1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:08.660\n And, you know, superintelligence seems likely,\n\n1:30:11.100 --> 1:30:14.200\n although we still don't know if we're magical,\n\n1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:16.320\n but I suspect we're not.\n\n1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:18.820\n And it seems likely that it'll create possibilities\n\n1:30:18.820 --> 1:30:20.900\n that are interesting for us,\n\n1:30:20.900 --> 1:30:24.500\n and its interests will be interesting for that,\n\n1:30:24.500 --> 1:30:25.880\n for whatever it is.\n\n1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:30.060\n It's not obvious why its interests would somehow\n\n1:30:30.060 --> 1:30:32.360\n want to fight over some square foot of dirt,\n\n1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:37.360\n or, you know, whatever the usual fears are about.\n\n1:30:37.660 --> 1:30:38.980\n So you don't think it'll inherit\n\n1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:41.260\n some of the darker aspects of human nature?\n\n1:30:42.140 --> 1:30:45.180\n Depends on how you think reality's constructed.\n\n1:30:45.180 --> 1:30:48.020\n So for whatever reason,\n\n1:30:48.020 --> 1:30:50.540\n human beings are in, let's say,\n\n1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:52.300\n creative tension and opposition\n\n1:30:52.300 --> 1:30:55.340\n with both our good and bad forces.\n\n1:30:55.340 --> 1:30:58.180\n Like, there's lots of philosophical understanding of that.\n\n1:30:58.180 --> 1:31:03.180\n I don't know why that would be different.\n\n1:31:03.180 --> 1:31:06.700\n So you think the evil is necessary for the good?\n\n1:31:06.700 --> 1:31:08.180\n I mean, the tension.\n\n1:31:08.180 --> 1:31:09.080\n I don't know about evil,\n\n1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:11.620\n but like we live in a competitive world\n\n1:31:11.620 --> 1:31:16.620\n where your good is somebody else's evil.\n\n1:31:16.660 --> 1:31:19.280\n You know, there's the malignant part of it,\n\n1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:22.720\n but that seems to be self limiting,\n\n1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:26.280\n although occasionally it's super horrible.\n\n1:31:26.280 --> 1:31:29.980\n But yes, there's a debate over ideas,\n\n1:31:29.980 --> 1:31:32.340\n and some people have different beliefs,\n\n1:31:32.340 --> 1:31:34.580\n and that debate itself is a process.\n\n1:31:34.580 --> 1:31:37.580\n So the arriving at something.\n\n1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:39.360\n Yeah, and why wouldn't that continue?\n\n1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:40.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:41.580 --> 1:31:43.140\n But you don't think that whole process\n\n1:31:43.140 --> 1:31:46.140\n will leave humans behind in a way that's painful?\n\n1:31:47.420 --> 1:31:48.660\n Emotionally painful, yes.\n\n1:31:48.660 --> 1:31:51.060\n For the 0.1%, they'll be.\n\n1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:52.340\n Why isn't it already painful\n\n1:31:52.340 --> 1:31:54.060\n for a large percentage of the population?\n\n1:31:54.060 --> 1:31:54.900\n And it is.\n\n1:31:54.900 --> 1:31:57.860\n I mean, society does have a lot of stress in it,\n\n1:31:57.860 --> 1:32:00.660\n about the 1%, and about the this, and about the that,\n\n1:32:00.660 --> 1:32:03.740\n but you know, everybody has a lot of stress in their life\n\n1:32:03.740 --> 1:32:05.220\n about what they find satisfying,\n\n1:32:05.220 --> 1:32:09.800\n and you know, know yourself seems to be the proper dictum,\n\n1:32:10.780 --> 1:32:14.200\n and pursue something that makes your life meaningful\n\n1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:18.700\n seems proper, and there's so many avenues on that.\n\n1:32:18.700 --> 1:32:21.100\n Like, there's so much unexplored space\n\n1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:25.500\n at every single level, you know.\n\n1:32:25.500 --> 1:32:29.640\n I'm somewhat of, my nephew called me a jaded optimist.\n\n1:32:29.640 --> 1:32:33.820\n And you know, so it's.\n\n1:32:33.820 --> 1:32:37.140\n There's a beautiful tension in that label,\n\n1:32:37.140 --> 1:32:40.940\n but if you were to look back at your life,\n\n1:32:40.940 --> 1:32:45.780\n and could relive a moment, a set of moments,\n\n1:32:45.780 --> 1:32:49.220\n because there were the happiest times of your life,\n\n1:32:49.220 --> 1:32:52.580\n outside of family, what would that be?\n\n1:32:54.660 --> 1:32:56.680\n I don't want to relive any moments.\n\n1:32:56.680 --> 1:32:58.020\n I like that.\n\n1:32:58.020 --> 1:33:01.340\n I like that situation where you have some amount of optimism\n\n1:33:01.340 --> 1:33:04.840\n and then the anxiety of the unknown.\n\n1:33:06.260 --> 1:33:10.100\n So you love the unknown, the mystery of it.\n\n1:33:10.100 --> 1:33:11.220\n I don't know about the mystery.\n\n1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:12.920\n It sure gets your blood pumping.\n\n1:33:14.060 --> 1:33:17.100\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n1:33:17.100 --> 1:33:20.640\n Of life, on this pale blue dot?\n\n1:33:21.740 --> 1:33:23.860\n It seems to be what it does.\n\n1:33:25.260 --> 1:33:29.260\n Like, the universe, for whatever reason,\n\n1:33:29.260 --> 1:33:32.780\n makes atoms, which makes us, which we do stuff.\n\n1:33:34.340 --> 1:33:38.020\n And we figure out things, and we explore things, and.\n\n1:33:38.020 --> 1:33:39.820\n That's just what it is.\n\n1:33:39.820 --> 1:33:41.580\n It's not just.\n\n1:33:41.580 --> 1:33:43.560\n Yeah, it is.\n\n1:33:44.540 --> 1:33:46.880\n Jim, I don't think there's a better place to end it\n\n1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:50.100\n is a huge honor, and.\n\n1:33:50.100 --> 1:33:51.180\n Well, that was super fun.\n\n1:33:51.180 --> 1:33:52.520\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n1:33:52.520 -->
