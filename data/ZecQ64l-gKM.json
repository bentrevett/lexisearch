who's one of the most fascinating, brilliant,\n\n00:07.440 --> 00:10.660\n out of the box thinking scientists I've ever spoken to.\n\n00:11.520 --> 00:14.600\n This episode was recorded more than two weeks ago,\n\n00:14.600 --> 00:17.200\n so the war in Ukraine is not mentioned.\n\n00:17.200 --> 00:19.400\n I have been spending a lot of time each day\n\n00:19.400 --> 00:22.080\n talking to people in Ukraine and Russia.\n\n00:22.080 --> 00:23.920\n I have family, friends, colleagues,\n\n00:23.920 --> 00:27.340\n and loved ones in both countries.\n\n00:27.340 --> 00:30.240\n I will try to release a solo episode on this war,\n\n00:30.240 --> 00:31.880\n but I've been failing to find the words\n\n00:31.880 --> 00:36.000\n that make sense of it for myself and others,\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:37.600\n so I may not.\n\n00:37.600 --> 00:40.640\n I ask for your understanding no matter which path I take.\n\n00:41.680 --> 00:44.400\n Most of my time is spent trying to help\n\n00:44.400 --> 00:46.240\n as much as I can privately.\n\n00:47.160 --> 00:49.360\n I'm talking to people who are suffering,\n\n00:49.360 --> 00:51.420\n who are angry, afraid.\n\n00:52.760 --> 00:55.700\n When I returned to this conversation with Lee,\n\n00:55.700 --> 00:57.500\n I couldn't help but smile.\n\n00:57.500 --> 01:01.560\n He's a beautiful, brilliant, and hilarious human being.\n\n01:01.560 --> 01:03.680\n He's basically a human manifestation\n\n01:03.680 --> 01:06.480\n of the mad scientist Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.\n\n01:07.960 --> 01:10.960\n I thought about quitting this podcast for a time,\n\n01:10.960 --> 01:13.260\n but for now at least, I'll keep going.\n\n01:14.100 --> 01:16.080\n I love people too much.\n\n01:16.080 --> 01:17.880\n You, the listener.\n\n01:17.880 --> 01:21.320\n I meet folks on the street or when I run.\n\n01:21.320 --> 01:23.600\n You say a few kind words about the podcast\n\n01:23.600 --> 01:26.800\n and we talk about life, the small things,\n\n01:26.800 --> 01:28.240\n and the big things.\n\n01:28.240 --> 01:29.500\n All of it gives me hope.\n\n01:30.400 --> 01:32.360\n People are just amazing.\n\n01:32.360 --> 01:34.040\n You are amazing.\n\n01:34.040 --> 01:37.280\n I ask for your support, wisdom, and patience\n\n01:37.280 --> 01:41.480\n as I keep going with this silly little podcast,\n\n01:41.480 --> 01:43.880\n including through some difficult conversations\n\n01:45.760 --> 01:49.460\n and hopefully many fascinating and fun ones too.\n\n01:49.460 --> 01:51.460\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:51.460 --> 01:53.500\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:53.500 --> 01:54.820\n in the description.\n\n01:54.820 --> 01:58.580\n And now, dear friends, here's Lee Cronin.\n\n01:59.580 --> 02:02.780\n How do you think life originated on Earth\n\n02:02.780 --> 02:06.580\n and what insights does that give us about life?\n\n02:06.580 --> 02:08.540\n If we go back to the origin of Earth\n\n02:08.540 --> 02:13.540\n and you think about maybe 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 billion years ago,\n\n02:13.540 --> 02:14.780\n the planet was quite hot.\n\n02:14.780 --> 02:16.820\n There was a limited number of minerals.\n\n02:16.820 --> 02:20.020\n There was some carbon, some water, and I think\n\n02:20.020 --> 02:22.340\n that maybe it's a really simple set of chemistry\n\n02:22.340 --> 02:25.300\n that we really don't understand.\n\n02:25.300 --> 02:27.660\n So that means you've got a finite number of elements\n\n02:27.660 --> 02:31.260\n that are going to react very simply with one another\n\n02:31.260 --> 02:33.220\n and out of that mess comes a cell.\n\n02:33.220 --> 02:35.940\n So literally sand turns into cells\n\n02:35.940 --> 02:38.020\n and it seems to happen quick.\n\n02:38.020 --> 02:41.460\n So what I think I can say with some degree of,\n\n02:41.460 --> 02:43.940\n I think not certainty, but curiosity,\n\n02:43.940 --> 02:47.300\n genuine curiosity is that life happened fast.\n\n02:47.300 --> 02:48.940\n Yeah, so when we say fast,\n\n02:50.340 --> 02:53.060\n this is a pretty surprising fact\n\n02:53.060 --> 02:55.100\n and maybe you can actually correct me and elaborate,\n\n02:55.100 --> 02:59.500\n but it seems like most, like 70 or 80% of the time\n\n02:59.500 --> 03:01.460\n that Earth has been around, there's been life on it,\n\n03:01.460 --> 03:03.180\n like some very significant percentage.\n\n03:03.180 --> 03:06.300\n So when you say fast, like the slow part\n\n03:06.300 --> 03:09.660\n is from single cell or from bacteria\n\n03:09.660 --> 03:11.700\n to something more complicated, organisms.\n\n03:11.700 --> 03:14.900\n It seems like most of the time that Earth has been around,\n\n03:14.900 --> 03:18.940\n it's been single cell or like very basic organisms,\n\n03:18.940 --> 03:20.460\n like a couple billion years.\n\n03:20.460 --> 03:21.780\n But yeah, you're right.\n\n03:21.780 --> 03:26.180\n That's really, I recently kind of revisited our history\n\n03:26.180 --> 03:30.180\n and saw this and I was just looking at the timeline.\n\n03:30.180 --> 03:33.780\n Wait a minute, like how did life just spring up so quickly?\n\n03:33.780 --> 03:35.620\n Like really quickly.\n\n03:35.620 --> 03:38.900\n That makes me think that it really wanted to.\n\n03:38.900 --> 03:42.900\n Like put another way, it's very easy for life to spring.\n\n03:42.900 --> 03:45.900\n Yeah, I agree, I think it's much more inevitable\n\n03:45.900 --> 03:49.900\n and I think I try to kind of, not provoke,\n\n03:49.900 --> 03:51.900\n but try and push chemists to think about,\n\n03:51.900 --> 03:54.900\n because chemists are central to this problem, right?\n\n03:54.900 --> 03:57.260\n Of understanding the origin of life on Earth, at least,\n\n03:57.260 --> 03:59.500\n because we're made of chemistry.\n\n03:59.500 --> 04:02.540\n But I wonder if the origin of life on a planet,\n\n04:02.540 --> 04:05.100\n or sorry, the emergence of life on the planet is as,\n\n04:05.100 --> 04:08.100\n common as the formation of a star.\n\n04:08.100 --> 04:10.700\n And if you start framing it in that way,\n\n04:10.700 --> 04:12.220\n it allows you to then look at the universe\n\n04:12.220 --> 04:14.300\n slightly differently, because,\n\n04:14.300 --> 04:16.700\n and we can get into this, I think, in quite some detail,\n\n04:16.700 --> 04:19.500\n but I think, to come back to your question,\n\n04:19.500 --> 04:23.100\n I have little idea of how life got started,\n\n04:23.100 --> 04:24.900\n but I know it was simple.\n\n04:24.900 --> 04:27.700\n And I know that the process of selection\n\n04:27.700 --> 04:31.700\n had to occur before the, by the end of the day,\n\n04:31.700 --> 04:35.500\n the selection had to occur before the biology\n\n04:35.500 --> 04:39.780\n was established, so that selection built the framework\n\n04:39.780 --> 04:43.500\n from which life kind of grew in complexity\n\n04:43.500 --> 04:46.300\n and capability and functionality and autonomy.\n\n04:46.300 --> 04:48.300\n And I think these are all really important words\n\n04:48.300 --> 04:51.140\n that we can unpack over the next while.\n\n04:51.140 --> 04:53.100\n Can you say all the words again?\n\n04:53.100 --> 04:57.940\n So you said selection, so natural selection,\n\n04:57.940 --> 04:59.820\n the original A, B testing.\n\n04:59.820 --> 05:01.900\n And so, and then complexity,\n\n05:01.900 --> 05:05.500\n and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication,\n\n05:05.500 --> 05:09.020\n because I think that people misunderstand what life is.\n\n05:10.140 --> 05:12.020\n Some people say that life is a cell,\n\n05:12.020 --> 05:15.300\n and some people that say that life is a virus\n\n05:15.300 --> 05:19.820\n or life is an on off switch.\n\n05:19.820 --> 05:21.020\n I don't think it's that,\n\n05:21.020 --> 05:24.100\n life is the universe developing a memory.\n\n05:25.020 --> 05:27.500\n And the laws of physics and the way,\n\n05:27.500 --> 05:28.900\n well, there are no laws of physics.\n\n05:28.900 --> 05:32.860\n It's just memory free stuff, right?\n\n05:32.860 --> 05:34.460\n So there's only a finite number of ways\n\n05:34.460 --> 05:38.580\n you can arrange the fundamental particles to do things.\n\n05:38.580 --> 05:43.420\n Life is the universe developing a memory.\n\n05:43.420 --> 05:48.420\n So it's like sewing a piece of art slowly,\n\n05:49.340 --> 05:50.580\n and then you can look back at it.\n\n05:50.580 --> 05:55.580\n So, so there's a stickiness to life.\n\n05:56.580 --> 05:58.660\n It's like universe doing stuff.\n\n05:58.660 --> 06:01.820\n And when you say memory, it's like there's a stickiness\n\n06:01.820 --> 06:04.100\n to a bunch of the stuff that's building together.\n\n06:04.100 --> 06:07.220\n So like you can, in a stable way,\n\n06:07.220 --> 06:10.660\n like trace back the complexity\n\n06:10.660 --> 06:13.060\n and that tells a coherent story.\n\n06:13.060 --> 06:14.500\n Yeah, and I think, yeah.\n\n06:14.500 --> 06:19.500\n Okay, that's, by the way, very poetic and beautiful.\n\n06:19.540 --> 06:22.160\n Life is the universe developing a memory.\n\n06:24.180 --> 06:25.900\n Okay, and then there's autonomy,\n\n06:25.900 --> 06:27.580\n you said complexity we'll talk about,\n\n06:27.580 --> 06:30.100\n but it's a really interesting idea\n\n06:30.100 --> 06:33.540\n that selection preceded biology.\n\n06:33.540 --> 06:35.060\n Yeah, I think.\n\n06:35.060 --> 06:38.420\n So first of all, what is chemistry?\n\n06:38.420 --> 06:41.380\n Like does sand still count as chemistry?\n\n06:41.380 --> 06:43.980\n Sure, I mean, as a chemist, a card carrying chemist,\n\n06:43.980 --> 06:45.940\n if I'm allowed a card, I don't know.\n\n06:45.940 --> 06:46.780\n Don't know what I am most days, actually.\n\n06:46.780 --> 06:48.260\n What is a card made of?\n\n06:48.260 --> 06:49.660\n That's what I'm thinking.\n\n06:49.660 --> 06:52.340\n What's the chemical composition of the card?\n\n06:52.340 --> 06:53.860\n So what is chemistry?\n\n06:53.860 --> 06:55.620\n Well, chemistry is the thing that happens\n\n06:55.620 --> 06:58.340\n when you bring electrons together and you form bonds.\n\n06:58.340 --> 07:00.340\n So bonds, well, I say to people\n\n07:00.340 --> 07:02.380\n when they talk about life elsewhere,\n\n07:02.380 --> 07:04.780\n and I just say, well, there's bonds, there's hope,\n\n07:04.780 --> 07:07.020\n because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity.\n\n07:07.020 --> 07:09.500\n They allow you to record those memories,\n\n07:09.500 --> 07:11.340\n or at least on Earth.\n\n07:11.340 --> 07:15.580\n You could imagine a Stanislav Lemtri world\n\n07:15.580 --> 07:17.220\n where you might have life emerging\n\n07:17.220 --> 07:19.660\n or intelligence emerging before life.\n\n07:19.660 --> 07:21.980\n That may be something like Solaris or something,\n\n07:21.980 --> 07:25.200\n but to get to selection,\n\n07:25.200 --> 07:28.540\n if you can form, if atoms can combine and form bonds,\n\n07:28.540 --> 07:32.500\n those bonds, those atoms can bond to different elements\n\n07:32.500 --> 07:35.620\n and those molecules will have different identities\n\n07:35.620 --> 07:37.140\n and interact with each other differently,\n\n07:37.140 --> 07:39.940\n and then you can start to have some degree of causation\n\n07:39.940 --> 07:44.940\n or interaction and then selection and then existence.\n\n07:45.100 --> 07:49.820\n And then you go up the kind of the path of complexity.\n\n07:49.820 --> 07:52.500\n And so at least on Earth, as we know it,\n\n07:52.500 --> 07:56.380\n there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals\n\n07:56.380 --> 08:01.380\n to start searching that combinatorial space of bonds.\n\n08:01.460 --> 08:03.820\n So, okay, this is a really interesting question.\n\n08:03.820 --> 08:04.780\n Let's lay it out.\n\n08:04.780 --> 08:07.900\n So bonds, almost like cards.\n\n08:07.900 --> 08:11.980\n We say there's bonds, there is life,\n\n08:11.980 --> 08:14.260\n there's intelligence, there's consciousness.\n\n08:14.260 --> 08:18.060\n And what you just made me realize is\n\n08:18.060 --> 08:23.060\n that those can emerge, let's put bonds aside,\n\n08:24.620 --> 08:27.180\n those can emerge in any order.\n\n08:27.180 --> 08:28.820\n That's really brilliant.\n\n08:28.820 --> 08:32.140\n So intelligence can come before life.\n\n08:32.140 --> 08:36.200\n It's like panpsychists believe that consciousness,\n\n08:36.200 --> 08:41.200\n I guess, comes before life and before intelligence.\n\n08:41.620 --> 08:43.900\n So consciousness permeates all matter,\n\n08:43.900 --> 08:46.020\n it's some kind of fabric of reality.\n\n08:46.020 --> 08:47.940\n Okay, so like within this framework,\n\n08:47.940 --> 08:49.980\n you can kind of arrange everything,\n\n08:49.980 --> 08:52.340\n but you need to have the bonds\n\n08:53.900 --> 08:55.340\n that precedes everything else.\n\n08:55.340 --> 08:57.580\n Oh, and the other thing is selection.\n\n08:57.580 --> 09:02.460\n So like the mechanism of selection, that could proceed.\n\n09:02.460 --> 09:04.660\n See, couldn't that proceed bonds too?\n\n09:04.660 --> 09:05.740\n Whatever the hell selection is.\n\n09:05.740 --> 09:09.260\n So I would say that there is an elegant order to it.\n\n09:09.260 --> 09:13.580\n Bonds allow selection, allows the emergence of life,\n\n09:13.580 --> 09:15.860\n allows the emergence of multicellularity\n\n09:15.860 --> 09:18.300\n and then more information processing,\n\n09:18.300 --> 09:19.700\n building state machines all the way up.\n\n09:19.700 --> 09:23.540\n However, you could imagine a situation if you had,\n\n09:23.540 --> 09:25.380\n I don't know, a neutron star or a sun\n\n09:25.380 --> 09:28.660\n or what a ferromagnetic loops interacting with one another\n\n09:28.660 --> 09:31.100\n and these oscillators building state machines\n\n09:31.100 --> 09:32.580\n and these state machines reading something\n\n09:32.580 --> 09:34.300\n out in the environment.\n\n09:34.300 --> 09:36.460\n Over time, these state machines would be able\n\n09:36.460 --> 09:39.340\n to literally record what happened in the past\n\n09:39.340 --> 09:41.560\n and sense what's going on in the present\n\n09:41.560 --> 09:43.140\n and imagine the future.\n\n09:43.140 --> 09:46.220\n However, I don't think it's ever gonna be\n\n09:46.220 --> 09:49.020\n within a human comprehension, that type of life.\n\n09:49.900 --> 09:53.220\n I wouldn't count it out because whenever you say,\n\n09:53.220 --> 09:55.900\n I know in science, whenever I say something's impossible,\n\n09:55.900 --> 09:56.740\n I then wake up the next day and say,\n\n09:56.740 --> 09:57.860\n no, that's actually wrong.\n\n09:57.860 --> 10:00.540\n I mean, there are some limits, of course.\n\n10:00.540 --> 10:03.480\n I don't see myself traveling fast and light anytime soon,\n\n10:03.480 --> 10:04.320\n but...\n\n10:04.320 --> 10:05.620\n Eric Weinstein says that's possible,\n\n10:05.620 --> 10:06.660\n so he will say you're wrong.\n\n10:06.660 --> 10:08.700\n Sure, but I'm an experimentalist as well,\n\n10:08.700 --> 10:11.380\n so one of my, I have two superpowers.\n\n10:11.380 --> 10:14.540\n My stupidity, and I don't mean that as a,\n\n10:14.540 --> 10:16.620\n I'm like absolutely completely witless,\n\n10:16.620 --> 10:19.000\n but I mean my ability to kind of just start again\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:22.220\n and ask the question and then do it with an experiment.\n\n10:22.220 --> 10:24.340\n I always wanted to be a theoretician growing up,\n\n10:24.340 --> 10:27.140\n but I just didn't have the intellectual capability,\n\n10:27.140 --> 10:30.580\n but I was able to think of experiments in my head\n\n10:30.580 --> 10:35.580\n I could then do in my lab or when I was a child outside\n\n10:35.780 --> 10:37.820\n and then those experiments in my head\n\n10:37.820 --> 10:40.020\n and then outside reinforced one another.\n\n10:40.020 --> 10:42.500\n So I think that's a very good way of kind of\n\n10:42.500 --> 10:44.340\n grounding the science, right?\n\n10:44.340 --> 10:46.660\n Well, that's a nice way to think about theoreticians\n\n10:46.660 --> 10:49.620\n is they're just people who run experiments in their head.\n\n10:49.620 --> 10:51.620\n I mean, that's exactly what Einstein did, right?\n\n10:51.620 --> 10:54.420\n But you were also capable of doing that in the head,\n\n10:54.420 --> 10:57.000\n in your head, inside your head and in the real world\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.420\n and the connection between the two\n\n10:59.420 --> 11:02.560\n is when you first discovered your superpower stupidity.\n\n11:02.560 --> 11:03.400\n I like it.\n\n11:03.400 --> 11:04.220\n Yes, there you go.\n\n11:04.220 --> 11:05.460\n What's the second superpower?\n\n11:05.460 --> 11:08.420\n Your accent or is that?\n\n11:08.420 --> 11:09.860\n Well, I don't know.\n\n11:09.860 --> 11:11.580\n I am genuinely curious.\n\n11:11.580 --> 11:15.020\n So I have, like everybody, ego problems,\n\n11:15.020 --> 11:16.900\n but my curiosity is bigger than my ego.\n\n11:16.900 --> 11:20.340\n So as long as that happens, I can cope.\n\n11:20.340 --> 11:21.260\n That's awesome.\n\n11:21.260 --> 11:22.260\n That is so powerful.\n\n11:22.260 --> 11:23.940\n You're just dropping some powerful lines.\n\n11:23.940 --> 11:26.740\n So curiosity is bigger than ego.\n\n11:26.740 --> 11:28.100\n That's something I have to think about\n\n11:28.100 --> 11:30.780\n because you always struggle about the role of ego in life\n\n11:30.780 --> 11:35.780\n and that's so nice to think about,\n\n11:36.180 --> 11:37.720\n don't think about the size of ego,\n\n11:37.720 --> 11:38.900\n the absolute size of ego.\n\n11:38.900 --> 11:40.780\n Think about the relative size of ego\n\n11:40.780 --> 11:44.260\n to the other horses pulling at you.\n\n11:44.260 --> 11:46.600\n If the curiosity one is bigger,\n\n11:46.600 --> 11:51.300\n then ego will do just fine and make you fun to talk to.\n\n11:51.300 --> 11:53.620\n Anyway, so those are the two superpowers.\n\n11:53.620 --> 11:55.300\n How do those connect to natural selection\n\n11:55.300 --> 11:58.460\n or selection and bonds and, I forgot already,\n\n11:58.460 --> 11:59.960\n life and consciousness?\n\n11:59.960 --> 12:02.060\n So we're going back to selection in the universe\n\n12:02.060 --> 12:03.820\n and origin of life on Earth.\n\n12:03.820 --> 12:07.780\n I mean, selection, I'm convinced that selection\n\n12:07.780 --> 12:09.500\n is a force in the universe.\n\n12:09.500 --> 12:14.460\n Not a fundamental force, but it is a directing force\n\n12:14.460 --> 12:18.140\n because existence, although existence appears\n\n12:18.140 --> 12:21.100\n to be the default, the existence of what,\n\n12:21.100 --> 12:24.340\n why does, and we can get to this later, I think,\n\n12:24.340 --> 12:29.140\n but it's amazing that discrete things exist\n\n12:29.140 --> 12:31.000\n and you see this cup.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.740\n It's not the sexiest cup in the world,\n\n12:33.740 --> 12:35.020\n but it's pretty functional.\n\n12:35.020 --> 12:38.780\n This cup, the complexity of this cup\n\n12:38.780 --> 12:39.760\n isn't just in the object.\n\n12:39.760 --> 12:42.180\n It is literally the lineage of people making cups\n\n12:42.180 --> 12:44.440\n and recognizing that, seeing that in their head,\n\n12:44.440 --> 12:45.720\n making an abstraction of a cup,\n\n12:45.720 --> 12:47.120\n and then making a different one.\n\n12:47.120 --> 12:50.460\n So I wonder how many billions of cups\n\n12:50.460 --> 12:52.920\n have come before this one,\n\n12:52.920 --> 12:55.080\n and that's the process of selection and existence,\n\n12:55.080 --> 12:56.620\n and the only reason the cup is still used\n\n12:56.620 --> 12:57.460\n is quite useful.\n\n12:57.460 --> 12:58.300\n I like the handle.\n\n12:58.300 --> 12:59.780\n It's convenient, so I don't die.\n\n12:59.780 --> 13:03.860\n I keep hydration, and so I think we are missing\n\n13:03.860 --> 13:07.060\n something fundamental in the universe about selection,\n\n13:07.060 --> 13:12.060\n and I think what biology is is a selection amplifier,\n\n13:12.580 --> 13:14.940\n and that this is where autonomy comes in,\n\n13:14.940 --> 13:17.300\n and actually I think that how humanity is gonna,\n\n13:17.300 --> 13:20.420\n humans and autonomous robots,\n\n13:20.420 --> 13:22.180\n or whatever we're gonna call them in the future,\n\n13:22.180 --> 13:24.620\n will supercharge that even further.\n\n13:24.620 --> 13:26.860\n So selection is happening in the universe,\n\n13:26.860 --> 13:28.780\n but if you look in the asteroid belt,\n\n13:28.780 --> 13:31.580\n selection, if objects are being kicked in and out\n\n13:31.580 --> 13:35.060\n of the asteroid belt, those trajectories are quite complex.\n\n13:35.060 --> 13:37.060\n You don't really look at that as productive selection\n\n13:37.060 --> 13:40.020\n because it's not doing anything to improve its function,\n\n13:40.020 --> 13:40.860\n but is it?\n\n13:40.860 --> 13:43.680\n The asteroid belt has existed for some time,\n\n13:43.680 --> 13:45.500\n so there is some selection going on,\n\n13:45.500 --> 13:49.480\n but the functionality is somewhat limited.\n\n13:49.480 --> 13:53.400\n On Earth, at the formation of Earth,\n\n13:53.400 --> 13:56.840\n interaction of chemicals and molecules in the environment\n\n13:56.840 --> 13:59.300\n gave selection, and then things could happen,\n\n13:59.300 --> 14:01.780\n because you could think about, in chemistry,\n\n14:01.780 --> 14:04.060\n we could have an infinite number of reactions happen,\n\n14:04.060 --> 14:06.420\n but all the reactions that are allowed to happen\n\n14:06.420 --> 14:07.300\n don't happen, why?\n\n14:07.300 --> 14:08.860\n Because there are energy barriers.\n\n14:08.860 --> 14:12.060\n So there must be some things called catalysts out there,\n\n14:12.060 --> 14:14.780\n or there are bits of minerals that,\n\n14:14.780 --> 14:17.020\n when two molecules get together in that mineral,\n\n14:17.020 --> 14:19.180\n it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction,\n\n14:19.180 --> 14:21.540\n and so the reaction is promoted.\n\n14:21.540 --> 14:24.420\n So suddenly you get one reaction over another\n\n14:24.420 --> 14:26.140\n series of possibilities occurring\n\n14:26.140 --> 14:28.100\n that makes a particular molecule,\n\n14:28.100 --> 14:30.020\n and this keeps happening in steps,\n\n14:30.020 --> 14:31.620\n and before you know it,\n\n14:31.620 --> 14:34.380\n almost these waves as discrete reactions work together,\n\n14:34.380 --> 14:38.060\n and you start to build a machinery\n\n14:38.060 --> 14:41.860\n that is run by existence.\n\n14:41.860 --> 14:44.940\n So as you go forward in time,\n\n14:44.940 --> 14:48.020\n the fact that the molecules, the bonds are getting,\n\n14:48.020 --> 14:49.500\n there are more bonds in a molecule,\n\n14:49.500 --> 14:50.900\n there's more function,\n\n14:50.900 --> 14:52.460\n there's more capability for this molecule\n\n14:52.460 --> 14:55.300\n to interact with other molecules, to redirect them,\n\n14:55.300 --> 14:57.140\n it's like a series of little,\n\n14:57.140 --> 14:59.980\n and I don't want to use this term too much,\n\n14:59.980 --> 15:01.620\n but it's almost thinking about\n\n15:01.620 --> 15:04.660\n the simplest von Neumann constructor,\n\n15:04.660 --> 15:05.980\n that's the simplest molecule\n\n15:05.980 --> 15:07.500\n that could build a more complicated molecule\n\n15:07.500 --> 15:09.100\n to build a more complicated molecule,\n\n15:09.100 --> 15:09.980\n and before you know it,\n\n15:09.980 --> 15:11.420\n when that more complicated molecule\n\n15:11.420 --> 15:14.740\n can act on the causal chain that's produced itself\n\n15:14.740 --> 15:15.900\n and change it,\n\n15:15.900 --> 15:18.460\n suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy,\n\n15:18.460 --> 15:21.820\n and that's where life, I think, emerges in earnest.\n\n15:21.820 --> 15:24.700\n Every single word in the past few paragraphs,\n\n15:24.700 --> 15:26.100\n let's break those apart,\n\n15:26.100 --> 15:30.900\n but who's von Neumann, what's a constructor,\n\n15:30.900 --> 15:33.900\n the closing of the loop that you're talking about,\n\n15:35.900 --> 15:37.940\n the molecule that starts becoming,\n\n15:37.940 --> 15:41.820\n I think you said like the smallest von Neumann constructor,\n\n15:41.820 --> 15:43.300\n the smallest, the minimal,\n\n15:43.300 --> 15:45.420\n so what do all those things mean,\n\n15:45.420 --> 15:47.980\n and what is, what are we supposed to imagine\n\n15:47.980 --> 15:51.260\n when we think about the smallest von Neumann constructor?\n\n15:51.260 --> 15:54.220\n So John von Neumann is a real hero,\n\n15:54.220 --> 15:56.060\n actually, not just me, but many people, I think,\n\n15:56.060 --> 15:58.580\n computer science and physics.\n\n15:58.580 --> 16:00.540\n He was an incredible intellect\n\n16:01.500 --> 16:03.020\n who probably solved a lot of the problems\n\n16:03.020 --> 16:04.140\n that we're working on today\n\n16:04.140 --> 16:05.540\n and just forgot to write them down.\n\n16:05.540 --> 16:06.540\n Yeah.\n\n16:06.540 --> 16:09.460\n And I'm not sure if it's John von Neumann or Johnny,\n\n16:09.460 --> 16:10.780\n as I think his friends called him,\n\n16:10.780 --> 16:14.820\n but I think he was Hungarian, a mathematician,\n\n16:14.820 --> 16:16.180\n came to the US,\n\n16:16.180 --> 16:19.620\n and basically was involved in the Manhattan Project\n\n16:19.620 --> 16:21.420\n in developing computation\n\n16:21.420 --> 16:24.300\n and came up with all sorts of ideas,\n\n16:24.300 --> 16:25.700\n and I think he was one of the first people\n\n16:25.700 --> 16:27.980\n to come up with cellular automata.\n\n16:27.980 --> 16:28.820\n And, but he...\n\n16:28.820 --> 16:29.660\n Oh, really?\n\n16:29.660 --> 16:30.500\n I didn't know this little fact.\n\n16:30.500 --> 16:31.860\n I think so, I think so.\n\n16:31.860 --> 16:32.700\n And I think...\n\n16:32.700 --> 16:34.860\n Well, anyway, if he didn't come up with it,\n\n16:34.860 --> 16:37.260\n he probably did come up with it and didn't write it down.\n\n16:37.260 --> 16:38.820\n There was a couple of people who did at the same time,\n\n16:38.820 --> 16:40.140\n and then Conway obviously took it on,\n\n16:40.140 --> 16:42.620\n and then Wolfram loves CAs.\n\n16:42.620 --> 16:44.740\n There is his fabric of the universe.\n\n16:44.740 --> 16:48.340\n And what I think he imagined was that he wasn't satisfied,\n\n16:48.340 --> 16:51.380\n and this may be incorrect recollection,\n\n16:51.380 --> 16:53.820\n but a lot of what I say is gonna be kind of\n\n16:55.060 --> 16:56.140\n just way out of my...\n\n16:56.140 --> 16:59.020\n You're, Lee, you're just part of the universe\n\n17:00.380 --> 17:02.300\n creating its memory, designing...\n\n17:02.300 --> 17:04.180\n Exactly, yeah, rewriting history.\n\n17:04.180 --> 17:05.020\n Rewriting history.\n\n17:05.020 --> 17:06.380\n Exactly, imperfectly.\n\n17:06.380 --> 17:09.100\n So, but what I mean is I think he liked this idea\n\n17:09.100 --> 17:14.100\n of thinking about how could a Turing machine\n\n17:14.300 --> 17:16.780\n literally build itself without a Turing machine, right?\n\n17:16.780 --> 17:19.620\n It's like literally how did state machines emerge?\n\n17:19.620 --> 17:21.660\n And I think that von Neumann constructors,\n\n17:21.660 --> 17:24.780\n he wanted to conceive of a minimal thing,\n\n17:24.780 --> 17:28.420\n autonomous, that could build itself.\n\n17:28.420 --> 17:30.740\n And what would those rules look like in the world?\n\n17:30.740 --> 17:32.820\n And that's what a von Neumann kind of constructor\n\n17:32.820 --> 17:35.500\n looked like, like it's a minimal hypothetical object\n\n17:35.500 --> 17:37.900\n that could build itself, self replicate.\n\n17:37.900 --> 17:41.340\n And I'm really fascinated by that\n\n17:41.340 --> 17:45.100\n because I think that although it's probably not\n\n17:45.100 --> 17:47.980\n exactly what happened, it's a nice model\n\n17:47.980 --> 17:49.540\n because as chemists, if we could go back\n\n17:49.540 --> 17:51.980\n to the origin of life and think about\n\n17:51.980 --> 17:55.980\n what is a minimal machine that can get structured randomly?\n\n17:55.980 --> 18:00.980\n So like with no prime mover, with no architect,\n\n18:01.260 --> 18:03.620\n it assembles through just existence.\n\n18:03.620 --> 18:06.220\n So random stuff bumping in together\n\n18:06.220 --> 18:07.860\n and you make this first molecule.\n\n18:07.860 --> 18:11.540\n So you have molecule A and molecule A interacts\n\n18:11.540 --> 18:14.100\n with another random molecule B and they get together\n\n18:14.100 --> 18:15.540\n and they realize by working together\n\n18:15.540 --> 18:17.620\n they can make more of themselves,\n\n18:17.620 --> 18:19.580\n but then they realize they can mutate\n\n18:19.580 --> 18:21.460\n so they can make AB prime.\n\n18:21.460 --> 18:24.100\n So AB prime is different to AB\n\n18:24.100 --> 18:27.500\n and then AB prime can then act back\n\n18:27.500 --> 18:29.700\n where A and B are being created\n\n18:29.700 --> 18:32.980\n and slightly nudge that causal chain\n\n18:32.980 --> 18:37.980\n and make AB prime more evolvable or learn more.\n\n18:38.820 --> 18:40.580\n So that's the closing the loop part.\n\n18:40.580 --> 18:42.060\n Closing the loop part, got it.\n\n18:42.060 --> 18:46.940\n It feels like the mutation part is not that difficult.\n\n18:46.940 --> 18:48.140\n It feels like the difficult part\n\n18:48.140 --> 18:50.900\n is just creating a copy of yourself as step one.\n\n18:50.900 --> 18:55.900\n That seems like one of the greatest inventions\n\n18:56.220 --> 19:00.580\n in the history of the universe is the first molecule\n\n19:00.580 --> 19:04.660\n that figured out, holy shit, I can create a copy of myself.\n\n19:04.660 --> 19:06.980\n How hard is that?\n\n19:06.980 --> 19:09.780\n I think it's really, really easy.\n\n19:09.780 --> 19:11.020\n Okay, I did not expect that.\n\n19:11.020 --> 19:12.660\n I think it's really, really easy.\n\n19:12.660 --> 19:15.180\n Well, let's take a step back.\n\n19:15.180 --> 19:19.260\n I think replicating molecules are rare,\n\n19:19.260 --> 19:22.060\n but if you say, I think I was saying on,\n\n19:22.060 --> 19:23.900\n I probably got into trouble on Twitter the other day,\n\n19:23.900 --> 19:24.940\n so I was trying to work this.\n\n19:24.940 --> 19:27.180\n There's about more than 18 mils of water in there.\n\n19:27.180 --> 19:31.700\n So one mole of water, 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules.\n\n19:31.700 --> 19:33.940\n That's about the number of stars in universe, I think,\n\n19:33.940 --> 19:34.780\n of the order.\n\n19:34.780 --> 19:37.140\n So there's three universe worth, but between one and.\n\n19:37.140 --> 19:38.460\n Somebody corrected you on Twitter?\n\n19:38.460 --> 19:40.860\n Yeah, as if, I'm always being corrected.\n\n19:40.860 --> 19:44.100\n It's a great, but there's a lot of molecules in the water.\n\n19:44.100 --> 19:47.700\n And so there's a lot of, so although it's for you and me,\n\n19:47.700 --> 19:49.540\n really hard to conceive of,\n\n19:49.540 --> 19:54.540\n if existence is not the default for a long period of time,\n\n19:55.220 --> 19:57.820\n because what happens is the molecules get degraded.\n\n19:57.820 --> 20:00.060\n So much of the possibilities in the universe\n\n20:00.060 --> 20:01.860\n are just broken back into atoms.\n\n20:01.860 --> 20:06.020\n So you have this kind of destruction of the molecules\n\n20:06.020 --> 20:07.700\n for our chemical reactions.\n\n20:07.700 --> 20:09.980\n So you only need one or two molecules\n\n20:09.980 --> 20:12.260\n to become good at copying themselves\n\n20:12.260 --> 20:15.060\n for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool\n\n20:15.060 --> 20:16.380\n and start to grow.\n\n20:16.380 --> 20:18.940\n And so then replication actually over time,\n\n20:18.940 --> 20:23.020\n when you have bonds, I think is much simpler, much easier.\n\n20:23.020 --> 20:25.540\n And I even found this in my lab years ago.\n\n20:25.540 --> 20:29.460\n I had one of the reasons I started doing inorganic chemistry\n\n20:29.460 --> 20:32.500\n and making rust, making a bit of rust based on\n\n20:32.500 --> 20:35.020\n a thing called molybdenum, molybdenum oxide\n\n20:35.020 --> 20:38.620\n is this molybdenum oxide, very simple.\n\n20:38.620 --> 20:40.940\n But when you add acid to it and some electrons,\n\n20:40.940 --> 20:44.700\n they make these molecules you just cannot possibly imagine\n\n20:44.700 --> 20:46.980\n would be constructed big, gigantic wheels\n\n20:46.980 --> 20:50.180\n of 154 molybdenum atoms in a wheel\n\n20:50.180 --> 20:54.380\n or I cost a dodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms\n\n20:54.380 --> 20:55.460\n all in the same pot.\n\n20:55.460 --> 20:56.940\n And I realized when I,\n\n20:56.940 --> 20:58.780\n and I just finished experiments two years ago,\n\n20:58.780 --> 21:00.940\n I've just published a couple of papers on this,\n\n21:00.940 --> 21:05.100\n that they're actually, there is a random small molecule\n\n21:05.100 --> 21:07.860\n with 12 atoms in it that can form randomly,\n\n21:07.860 --> 21:10.860\n but it happens to template its own production.\n\n21:10.860 --> 21:14.060\n And then by chance, it templates the ring,\n\n21:14.060 --> 21:17.300\n just an accident, just like just an absolute accident.\n\n21:17.300 --> 21:21.980\n And that ring also helps make the small 12 mer.\n\n21:21.980 --> 21:25.500\n And so you have what's called an autocatalytic set\n\n21:25.500 --> 21:30.500\n where A makes B and B helps make A and vice versa.\n\n21:32.860 --> 21:34.580\n And you then make this loop.\n\n21:34.580 --> 21:39.580\n So it's a bit like these, they all work in synergy\n\n21:39.580 --> 21:43.500\n to make this chain of events that grow.\n\n21:43.500 --> 21:46.620\n And it doesn't take a very sophisticated model\n\n21:46.620 --> 21:50.540\n to show that if you have these objects are competing\n\n21:50.540 --> 21:53.300\n and then collaborating to help one another build,\n\n21:53.300 --> 21:55.020\n they just grow out of the mess.\n\n21:55.020 --> 21:56.980\n And although they seem improbable,\n\n21:56.980 --> 22:01.580\n they are improbable, in fact, impossible in one step.\n\n22:01.580 --> 22:02.820\n There's multiple steps.\n\n22:02.820 --> 22:04.300\n This is when the blind people look\n\n22:04.300 --> 22:06.660\n at the blind watchmaker argument\n\n22:06.660 --> 22:10.820\n and you talk about how could a watch spontaneously emerge?\n\n22:10.820 --> 22:11.740\n Well, it doesn't.\n\n22:11.740 --> 22:14.500\n It's a lineage of watches and cruder devices\n\n22:14.500 --> 22:17.820\n that are bootstrapped onto one another.\n\n22:19.140 --> 22:23.220\n Right, so it's very improbable,\n\n22:23.220 --> 22:25.380\n but once you get that little discovery\n\n22:25.380 --> 22:29.540\n like with the wheel and fire,\n\n22:29.540 --> 22:34.540\n it just explodes because it's so successful, it explodes.\n\n22:34.540 --> 22:37.780\n It explodes, it's basically selection.\n\n22:37.780 --> 22:40.500\n So this templating mechanism that allows you\n\n22:40.500 --> 22:43.460\n to have a little like blueprint for yourself,\n\n22:43.460 --> 22:45.100\n how you go through different procedures\n\n22:45.100 --> 22:46.620\n is to build copies of yourself.\n\n22:49.500 --> 22:52.940\n So in chemistry somehow it's possible to imagine\n\n22:52.940 --> 22:57.020\n that that kind of thing is easy to spring up.\n\n22:57.020 --> 22:59.820\n In more complex organisms, it feels like a different thing\n\n22:59.820 --> 23:00.860\n and much more complicated.\n\n23:00.860 --> 23:04.340\n Like we're having like multiple abstractions\n\n23:04.340 --> 23:06.820\n of the birds and the bees conversation here,\n\n23:06.820 --> 23:10.220\n but with human, I'm sorry, with complex organisms,\n\n23:10.220 --> 23:14.220\n it feels like difficult to have reproduction to,\n\n23:15.940 --> 23:17.140\n that's gonna get clipped out.\n\n23:17.140 --> 23:18.540\n I'm gonna make fun of that.\n\n23:18.540 --> 23:23.540\n It's difficult to develop this idea\n\n23:23.860 --> 23:25.820\n of making copies of yourself or no.\n\n23:26.860 --> 23:30.260\n Because that seems like a magical idea for life to,\n\n23:30.260 --> 23:35.260\n but wow, that feels like very necessary\n\n23:35.500 --> 23:37.700\n for what selection is, for what evolution is.\n\n23:37.700 --> 23:40.620\n But then if selection precedes all of this,\n\n23:40.620 --> 23:43.420\n then maybe these are just like echoes\n\n23:43.420 --> 23:47.340\n of the selecting mechanism at different scales.\n\n23:47.340 --> 23:48.420\n Yeah, that's exactly it.\n\n23:48.420 --> 23:52.020\n So selection is the default in the universe if you want to.\n\n23:52.020 --> 23:54.780\n And what happens is that life,\n\n23:54.780 --> 23:57.660\n the solution that life has got on earth,\n\n23:57.660 --> 24:01.300\n life on earth, biology on earth is unique to earth.\n\n24:01.300 --> 24:03.220\n We can talk about that.\n\n24:03.220 --> 24:05.740\n And that was really hard fought for,\n\n24:05.740 --> 24:08.660\n but that is a solution that works on earth,\n\n24:08.660 --> 24:10.620\n the ribosome, the fundamental machine\n\n24:10.620 --> 24:15.180\n that is responsible for every cell on earth\n\n24:15.180 --> 24:18.500\n of whatever, wherever it is in the kingdom of life.\n\n24:18.500 --> 24:21.180\n That is an incredibly complex object,\n\n24:21.180 --> 24:22.900\n but it was evolved over time\n\n24:22.900 --> 24:24.620\n and it wasn't involved in a vacuum.\n\n24:24.620 --> 24:27.980\n And I think that once we understand that selection\n\n24:27.980 --> 24:32.700\n can occur without the ribosome,\n\n24:32.700 --> 24:34.180\n but what the ribosome does,\n\n24:34.180 --> 24:37.220\n it's a phase transition in replication.\n\n24:37.220 --> 24:39.100\n And I think that that, and also technology\n\n24:39.100 --> 24:44.100\n that is probably much easier to get to than we think.\n\n24:45.780 --> 24:50.780\n Why do you put the ribosome as a central part\n\n24:50.820 --> 24:52.380\n of living organisms on earth?\n\n24:52.380 --> 24:53.700\n It basically is a combination\n\n24:53.700 --> 24:57.260\n of two different polymer systems, so RNA and peptides.\n\n24:57.260 --> 24:59.500\n So the RNA world, if you like,\n\n24:59.500 --> 25:02.420\n gets transmitted and builds proteins\n\n25:02.420 --> 25:05.220\n and the proteins are responsible for all the catalysis.\n\n25:05.220 --> 25:07.300\n The majority of the catalysis goes on in the cell.\n\n25:07.300 --> 25:11.460\n No ribosome, no proteins, no decoding, no evolution.\n\n25:11.460 --> 25:14.340\n So ribosome is looking at the action.\n\n25:14.340 --> 25:17.780\n You don't put like the RNA itself as the critical thing,\n\n25:17.780 --> 25:20.780\n like information, you put action as the most important thing.\n\n25:20.780 --> 25:22.420\n I think the actual molecules\n\n25:22.420 --> 25:24.780\n that we have in biology right now are entirely contingent\n\n25:24.780 --> 25:27.340\n on the history of life on earth.\n\n25:27.340 --> 25:29.020\n There are so many possible solutions.\n\n25:29.020 --> 25:31.140\n And this is where chemistry got itself into,\n\n25:31.140 --> 25:33.460\n origin of life chemistry gets itself into a bit of a trap.\n\n25:33.460 --> 25:35.260\n Yeah, let me interrupt you there.\n\n25:35.260 --> 25:36.580\n You've tweeted, you're gonna get,\n\n25:36.580 --> 25:40.520\n I'm gonna cite your tweets like it's Shakespeare, okay?\n\n25:40.520 --> 25:43.740\n It's surprising you haven't gotten canceled on Twitter yet.\n\n25:43.740 --> 25:45.640\n Your brilliance once again saves you.\n\n25:46.660 --> 25:47.500\n I'm just kidding.\n\n25:49.020 --> 25:51.300\n You like to have a little bit of fun on Twitter.\n\n25:51.300 --> 25:52.780\n You've tweeted that quote,\n\n25:52.780 --> 25:56.020\n origin of life research is a scam.\n\n25:56.860 --> 26:00.180\n So if this is Shakespeare, can we analyze this word?\n\n26:00.180 --> 26:02.300\n Why is the origin of life research a scam?\n\n26:02.300 --> 26:05.240\n Aren't you kind of doing origin of life research?\n\n26:06.760 --> 26:08.180\n Okay, it was tongue in cheek, but yeah,\n\n26:08.180 --> 26:10.540\n I think, and I meant it as tongue in cheek.\n\n26:12.460 --> 26:14.460\n I'm not doing the origin of life research.\n\n26:14.460 --> 26:16.820\n I'm trying to make artificial life.\n\n26:16.820 --> 26:19.700\n And I also want to bound the likelihood\n\n26:19.700 --> 26:21.340\n of the origin of life on earth,\n\n26:21.340 --> 26:23.820\n but more importantly to find origin of life elsewhere.\n\n26:23.820 --> 26:26.020\n But let me directly address the tweet.\n\n26:26.020 --> 26:27.920\n There are many, many good chemists out there\n\n26:27.920 --> 26:31.500\n doing origin of life research, but I want to nudge them.\n\n26:31.500 --> 26:32.340\n And I think they're brilliant.\n\n26:32.340 --> 26:36.620\n Like there's no question the chemistry they are doing,\n\n26:36.620 --> 26:38.780\n the motivation is great.\n\n26:38.780 --> 26:40.580\n So what I meant by that tweet is saying\n\n26:40.580 --> 26:43.000\n that maybe they're making assumptions about saying,\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:47.440\n if only I could make this particular type of molecule,\n\n26:47.440 --> 26:52.100\n say this RNA molecule or this phosphodiester\n\n26:52.100 --> 26:54.140\n or this other molecule,\n\n26:54.140 --> 26:57.820\n it's gonna somehow unlock the origin of life.\n\n26:57.820 --> 27:00.580\n And I think that origin of life has been looking at this\n\n27:00.580 --> 27:01.980\n for a very long time.\n\n27:01.980 --> 27:05.700\n And whilst I think it's brilliant to work out\n\n27:05.700 --> 27:08.220\n how you can get to those molecules,\n\n27:08.220 --> 27:11.420\n I think that chemistry and chemists doing origin of life\n\n27:11.420 --> 27:15.940\n could be nudged into doing something even more profound.\n\n27:15.940 --> 27:18.460\n And so the argument I'm making,\n\n27:18.460 --> 27:20.260\n it's a bit like right now,\n\n27:20.260 --> 27:22.940\n let's say, I don't know, the first Tesla\n\n27:22.940 --> 27:25.820\n that makes its way to, I don't know,\n\n27:25.820 --> 27:27.060\n into a new country in the world.\n\n27:27.060 --> 27:29.660\n Let's say there's a country X\n\n27:29.660 --> 27:31.180\n that has never had a Tesla before\n\n27:31.180 --> 27:32.100\n and they get the Tesla.\n\n27:32.100 --> 27:32.940\n Russia.\n\n27:32.940 --> 27:34.260\n And they take the Tesla,\n\n27:34.260 --> 27:35.660\n and what they do is they take the Tesla apart\n\n27:35.660 --> 27:38.420\n and say, we want to find the origin of cars in the universe\n\n27:38.420 --> 27:41.140\n and say, okay, how did this form and how did this form?\n\n27:41.140 --> 27:42.620\n And they just randomly keep making\n\n27:42.620 --> 27:44.360\n till they make the door, they make the wheel,\n\n27:44.360 --> 27:46.220\n they make the steering column and all this stuff.\n\n27:46.220 --> 27:48.140\n And they say, well, that's the route.\n\n27:48.140 --> 27:50.440\n That's the way cars emerged on earth.\n\n27:50.440 --> 27:53.340\n But actually we know that there's a causal chain of cars\n\n27:53.340 --> 27:56.100\n going right back to Henry Ford and the horse and carriage.\n\n27:56.100 --> 27:57.740\n And before that, maybe, you know,\n\n27:58.820 --> 28:00.340\n where people were using wheels.\n\n28:00.340 --> 28:04.340\n And I think that obsession with the identities\n\n28:04.340 --> 28:06.140\n that we see in biology right now\n\n28:06.140 --> 28:09.260\n are giving us a false sense of security\n\n28:09.260 --> 28:10.960\n about what we're looking for.\n\n28:10.960 --> 28:15.960\n And I think that origin of life chemistry is in danger\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.740\n of not making the progress that it deserves\n\n28:20.740 --> 28:22.780\n because the chemists are doing this.\n\n28:22.780 --> 28:24.260\n The field is exploding right now.\n\n28:24.260 --> 28:27.540\n There's amazing people out there, young and old doing this.\n\n28:27.540 --> 28:30.340\n And there's deservedly so more money going in.\n\n28:30.340 --> 28:31.860\n You know, I used to complain\n\n28:31.860 --> 28:34.100\n there's more money being spent searching for the Higgs boson\n\n28:34.100 --> 28:36.300\n that we know exists than the origin of life.\n\n28:36.300 --> 28:37.460\n You know, why is that?\n\n28:37.460 --> 28:39.780\n The origin, we understand the origin of life.\n\n28:39.780 --> 28:42.000\n We're gonna actually work out what life is.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.180\n And we're gonna be at a bound,\n\n28:43.180 --> 28:45.680\n the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe.\n\n28:45.680 --> 28:47.020\n And most important for us,\n\n28:47.020 --> 28:49.500\n we are gonna know or have a good idea\n\n28:49.500 --> 28:51.700\n of what the future of humanity looks like.\n\n28:51.700 --> 28:53.420\n You know, we need to understand\n\n28:53.420 --> 28:54.960\n that although we're precious,\n\n28:54.960 --> 28:57.140\n we're not the only life forms in the universe.\n\n28:57.140 --> 28:58.700\n Or that's my very strong impression.\n\n28:58.700 --> 29:00.100\n I have no data for that.\n\n29:00.100 --> 29:02.180\n It's just right now a belief.\n\n29:02.180 --> 29:03.380\n And I want to turn that belief\n\n29:03.380 --> 29:07.180\n into a more than a belief by experimentation.\n\n29:07.180 --> 29:09.480\n But coming back to the scam,\n\n29:09.480 --> 29:11.660\n the scam is if we just make this RNA,\n\n29:11.660 --> 29:16.660\n we've got this fluke event, we know how that's simple.\n\n29:17.540 --> 29:19.180\n Let's make this phosphodiester,\n\n29:19.180 --> 29:21.220\n or let's make ATP or ADP.\n\n29:21.220 --> 29:22.420\n We've got that part nailed.\n\n29:22.420 --> 29:24.420\n Let's now make this other molecule, another molecule.\n\n29:24.420 --> 29:26.460\n And how many molecules are gonna be enough?\n\n29:26.460 --> 29:28.380\n And then the reason I say this\n\n29:28.380 --> 29:30.580\n is when you go back to Craig Venter,\n\n29:30.580 --> 29:34.440\n when he invented his life form, Cyndia,\n\n29:35.340 --> 29:38.180\n this micro, this minimal plasmid,\n\n29:38.180 --> 29:43.180\n it's a myoplasma, something, I don't know the name of it,\n\n29:43.180 --> 29:45.580\n but he made this wonderful cell\n\n29:45.580 --> 29:48.360\n and said, I've invented life.\n\n29:48.360 --> 29:49.220\n Not quite.\n\n29:49.220 --> 29:52.700\n He facsimileed the genome from this entity\n\n29:52.700 --> 29:55.660\n and made it in the lab, all the DNA,\n\n29:55.660 --> 29:56.940\n but he didn't make the cell.\n\n29:56.940 --> 30:00.000\n He had to take an existing cell\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.680\n that has a causal chain going all the way back to Luca.\n\n30:02.680 --> 30:05.320\n And he showed when he took out the gene,\n\n30:05.320 --> 30:08.260\n the genes and put in his genes, synthesized,\n\n30:08.260 --> 30:09.840\n the cell could boot up.\n\n30:09.840 --> 30:11.940\n But it's remarkable that he could not make a cell\n\n30:11.940 --> 30:12.900\n from scratch.\n\n30:12.900 --> 30:15.120\n And even now today, synthetic biologists\n\n30:15.120 --> 30:17.300\n cannot make a cell from scratch\n\n30:17.300 --> 30:20.920\n because there's some contingent information embodied\n\n30:20.920 --> 30:23.780\n outside the genome in the cell.\n\n30:23.780 --> 30:26.140\n And that is just incredible.\n\n30:26.140 --> 30:28.120\n So there's lots of layers to the scam.\n\n30:29.940 --> 30:32.940\n Well, let me then ask the question,\n\n30:32.940 --> 30:37.200\n how can we create life in the lab from scratch?\n\n30:37.200 --> 30:39.420\n What have been the most promising attempts\n\n30:39.420 --> 30:41.860\n at creating life in the lab from scratch?\n\n30:41.860 --> 30:44.220\n Has anyone actually been able to do it?\n\n30:44.220 --> 30:46.340\n Do you think anyone will be able to do it\n\n30:46.340 --> 30:48.500\n in the near future if they haven't already?\n\n30:50.420 --> 30:53.660\n Yeah, I think that nobody has made life\n\n30:53.660 --> 30:54.740\n in the lab from scratch.\n\n30:54.740 --> 30:57.380\n Lots of people would argue that they have made progress.\n\n30:57.380 --> 30:59.300\n So Craig Venter, I think the synthesis\n\n30:59.300 --> 31:03.580\n of a synthetic genome milestone in human achievement.\n\n31:03.580 --> 31:04.420\n Brilliant.\n\n31:04.420 --> 31:06.340\n Yeah, can we just walk back and say,\n\n31:06.340 --> 31:09.740\n what would you say from your perspective,\n\n31:09.740 --> 31:12.960\n one of the world experts in exactly this area,\n\n31:12.960 --> 31:15.100\n what does it mean to create life from scratch\n\n31:15.100 --> 31:17.260\n where if you sit back, whether you do it\n\n31:17.260 --> 31:19.180\n or somebody else does it, it's like,\n\n31:20.040 --> 31:24.580\n damn, this is, we just created life.\n\n31:24.580 --> 31:27.580\n Well, I can tell you what I would expect,\n\n31:27.580 --> 31:30.220\n I would like to be able to do,\n\n31:30.220 --> 31:35.220\n is to go from sand to cells in my lab and...\n\n31:37.540 --> 31:39.060\n Can you explain what sand is?\n\n31:39.060 --> 31:42.780\n Yeah, just inorganic stuff, like basically just,\n\n31:42.780 --> 31:47.220\n so sand is just silicon oxide with some other ions in it,\n\n31:47.220 --> 31:50.980\n maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates,\n\n31:50.980 --> 31:52.980\n just basically clearly dead stuff\n\n31:52.980 --> 31:55.580\n that you could just grind rocks into sand.\n\n31:55.580 --> 31:57.940\n And it would be what, in a kind of vacuum\n\n31:57.940 --> 31:59.580\n so they could remove anything else\n\n31:59.580 --> 32:04.580\n that could possibly be like a shadow of life\n\n32:05.220 --> 32:06.340\n that can assist in the chemical.\n\n32:06.340 --> 32:07.940\n You could do that, you could insist and say,\n\n32:07.940 --> 32:09.940\n look, I'm gonna take, and not just inorganic,\n\n32:09.940 --> 32:12.580\n I want some more, I wanna cheat and have some organic,\n\n32:12.580 --> 32:13.900\n but I want inorganic organic,\n\n32:13.900 --> 32:16.100\n and I'll explain the play on words in a moment.\n\n32:16.100 --> 32:19.420\n So I would like to basically put into a world,\n\n32:19.420 --> 32:23.220\n let's say a completely synthetic world, if you like,\n\n32:23.220 --> 32:26.700\n a closed world, put some inorganic materials\n\n32:26.700 --> 32:30.020\n and just literally add some energy in some form,\n\n32:30.020 --> 32:33.660\n be it lightning or heat, UV light,\n\n32:33.660 --> 32:37.180\n and run this thing in cycles over time\n\n32:37.180 --> 32:38.620\n and let it solve the search problem.\n\n32:38.620 --> 32:41.140\n So I see the origin of life as a search problem\n\n32:41.140 --> 32:42.700\n in chemical space.\n\n32:42.700 --> 32:45.580\n And then I would wait, literally wait for a life form\n\n32:45.580 --> 32:46.580\n to crawl out of the test tube.\n\n32:46.580 --> 32:48.100\n That's a joke I tell my group.\n\n32:48.100 --> 32:51.620\n Literally wait for a very, don't worry,\n\n32:51.620 --> 32:52.540\n it's gonna be very feeble,\n\n32:52.540 --> 32:54.700\n it's not gonna take over the world.\n\n32:54.700 --> 32:56.020\n There's ways of ethically containing it.\n\n32:56.020 --> 32:57.180\n Famous last words.\n\n32:58.220 --> 33:01.380\n Indeed, indeed, indeed, but I.\n\n33:01.380 --> 33:03.220\n You know this is being recorded, right?\n\n33:03.220 --> 33:05.660\n It'll make you, it will not make you look good\n\n33:05.660 --> 33:07.620\n once it crawls out of the lab\n\n33:07.620 --> 33:09.940\n and destroys all of human civilization, but yes.\n\n33:09.940 --> 33:11.060\n But there is very good,\n\n33:11.060 --> 33:13.460\n there is a very good things you can do to prevent that.\n\n33:13.460 --> 33:15.580\n For instance, if you put stuff in your world,\n\n33:15.580 --> 33:17.460\n which isn't earth abundant,\n\n33:17.460 --> 33:20.420\n so let's say we make life based on molybdenum\n\n33:20.420 --> 33:21.940\n and it escapes, it would die immediately\n\n33:21.940 --> 33:23.460\n because there's not enough molybdenum in the environment.\n\n33:23.460 --> 33:26.700\n So we can put in, we can do responsible life.\n\n33:26.700 --> 33:29.900\n Or as I fantasize with my research group on our away day\n\n33:29.900 --> 33:31.500\n that would go in, it's, you know,\n\n33:31.500 --> 33:36.060\n I think it's actually morally if we don't find,\n\n33:36.060 --> 33:38.020\n until humanity finds life in the universe,\n\n33:38.020 --> 33:39.260\n this is going on a tangent,\n\n33:39.260 --> 33:42.020\n it's our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs,\n\n33:42.020 --> 33:43.820\n identify dead planets and bomb them\n\n33:43.820 --> 33:46.580\n with our origin of life machines and make them alive.\n\n33:46.580 --> 33:49.180\n I think it is our moral obligation to do that.\n\n33:50.260 --> 33:51.780\n Some people might argue with me about that,\n\n33:51.780 --> 33:54.420\n but I think that we need more life in the universe.\n\n33:54.420 --> 33:58.140\n And then we kind of forget we did it\n\n33:58.140 --> 34:00.860\n and then come back and then.\n\n34:00.860 --> 34:02.260\n So where did you come from?\n\n34:02.260 --> 34:04.020\n But coming back to the, what I'd expect.\n\n34:04.020 --> 34:06.820\n So I just say. Father, are you back?\n\n34:06.820 --> 34:09.220\n I think this is once again, a Rick and Morty episode.\n\n34:09.220 --> 34:11.940\n It's definitely all Rick and Morty all the way down.\n\n34:11.940 --> 34:15.540\n So we, I imagine we have this pristine experiment\n\n34:15.540 --> 34:18.100\n and everything is, you know, sanitized\n\n34:18.100 --> 34:20.060\n and we put in inorganic materials\n\n34:20.060 --> 34:22.220\n and we have cycles with them,\n\n34:22.220 --> 34:24.500\n day, night cycles, up, down, whatever.\n\n34:24.500 --> 34:27.260\n And we look for evidence of replication\n\n34:27.260 --> 34:28.660\n and evolution over time.\n\n34:28.660 --> 34:30.580\n And that's what the experiment should be.\n\n34:30.580 --> 34:32.460\n Now, are there people doing this in the world right now?\n\n34:32.460 --> 34:33.780\n There are a couple of,\n\n34:33.780 --> 34:35.780\n there's some really good groups doing this.\n\n34:35.780 --> 34:37.180\n There's some really interesting scientists\n\n34:37.180 --> 34:38.740\n doing this around the world.\n\n34:38.740 --> 34:43.740\n They're kind of perhaps too much associated with the scam.\n\n34:44.540 --> 34:48.500\n So, and so they're using molecules\n\n34:48.500 --> 34:50.860\n that are already, were already invented by biology.\n\n34:50.860 --> 34:54.100\n So there's a bit of replication built in,\n\n34:54.100 --> 34:55.780\n but I still think the work that is doing,\n\n34:55.780 --> 34:57.660\n they're doing is amazing.\n\n34:57.660 --> 35:00.180\n But I would like people to be a bit freer and say,\n\n35:00.180 --> 35:03.500\n let's just basically shake a load of sand in a box\n\n35:03.500 --> 35:04.580\n and wait for life to come out\n\n35:04.580 --> 35:06.300\n because that's what happened on earth.\n\n35:06.300 --> 35:08.020\n And so that we have to understand that.\n\n35:08.020 --> 35:10.140\n Now, how would I know I've been successful?\n\n35:10.140 --> 35:11.900\n Well, because I'm not obsessing\n\n35:11.900 --> 35:15.060\n with what molecules are in life now,\n\n35:15.060 --> 35:19.820\n I would wager a vast quantity of money.\n\n35:19.820 --> 35:21.900\n I'm not very rich, so just be a few dollars,\n\n35:21.900 --> 35:26.900\n but for me, the solution space will be different.\n\n35:27.180 --> 35:31.020\n So the genetic material will be not RNA.\n\n35:31.020 --> 35:33.580\n The proteins will not be what we think.\n\n35:33.580 --> 35:36.140\n The solutions will be just completely different.\n\n35:36.140 --> 35:37.740\n And it might be, and it will be very feeble\n\n35:37.740 --> 35:40.860\n because that's the other thing we should be able to show\n\n35:40.860 --> 35:43.780\n fairly robustly that even if I did make\n\n35:43.780 --> 35:46.060\n or someone did make a new life form in the lab,\n\n35:46.060 --> 35:50.020\n it would be so poor that it's not gonna leap out.\n\n35:50.020 --> 35:55.020\n It is the fear about making a lethal life form\n\n35:56.020 --> 36:00.620\n in the lab from scratch is similar to us imagining\n\n36:00.620 --> 36:02.500\n that we're gonna make the terminator\n\n36:02.500 --> 36:04.460\n at Boston Dynamics tomorrow.\n\n36:04.460 --> 36:07.140\n Simply not, and the problem is\n\n36:07.140 --> 36:08.420\n we don't communicate that properly.\n\n36:08.420 --> 36:12.820\n I know you yourself very, you explain this very well.\n\n36:12.820 --> 36:14.940\n There is not the AI catastrophe coming.\n\n36:15.980 --> 36:16.940\n We're very far away from that.\n\n36:16.940 --> 36:18.380\n That doesn't mean we should ignore it.\n\n36:18.380 --> 36:19.980\n Same with the origin of life catastrophe.\n\n36:19.980 --> 36:21.860\n It's not coming anytime soon.\n\n36:21.860 --> 36:24.820\n We shouldn't ignore it, but we shouldn't let that fear\n\n36:24.820 --> 36:26.500\n stop us from doing those experiments.\n\n36:26.500 --> 36:28.460\n But this is a much, much longer discussion\n\n36:28.460 --> 36:29.820\n because there's a lot of details there.\n\n36:29.820 --> 36:32.700\n I would say there is potential for catastrophic events\n\n36:33.580 --> 36:36.980\n to happen in much dumber ways.\n\n36:36.980 --> 36:40.020\n In AI space, there's a lot of ways to create,\n\n36:40.020 --> 36:43.140\n like social networks are creating a kind\n\n36:43.140 --> 36:46.300\n of accelerated set of events\n\n36:46.300 --> 36:48.340\n that we might not be able to control.\n\n36:48.340 --> 36:53.260\n The social network virality in the digital space\n\n36:53.260 --> 36:58.260\n can create mass movements of ideas that can then,\n\n36:58.820 --> 37:01.980\n if times are tough, create military conflict\n\n37:01.980 --> 37:02.980\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n37:02.980 --> 37:05.660\n But that's not super intelligent AI.\n\n37:05.660 --> 37:09.740\n That's an interesting at scale application of AI.\n\n37:09.740 --> 37:13.300\n If you look at viruses, viruses are pretty dumb,\n\n37:13.300 --> 37:16.780\n but at scale, their application is pretty detrimental.\n\n37:16.780 --> 37:21.780\n And so origin of life, much like all the kind of virology,\n\n37:25.220 --> 37:28.540\n the very contentious word of gain of function research\n\n37:28.540 --> 37:31.740\n and virology, sort of like research on viruses,\n\n37:33.420 --> 37:36.100\n messing with them genetically,\n\n37:36.100 --> 37:38.980\n that can create a lot of problems if not done well.\n\n37:38.980 --> 37:41.820\n So we have to be very cautious.\n\n37:41.820 --> 37:43.260\n So there's a kind of,\n\n37:43.260 --> 37:47.100\n whenever you're ultra cautious about stuff in AI\n\n37:47.100 --> 37:50.740\n or in virology and biology,\n\n37:50.740 --> 37:53.420\n it borders on cynicism, I would say,\n\n37:53.420 --> 37:56.740\n where it's like everything we do is going to turn out\n\n37:56.740 --> 37:58.660\n to be destructive and terrible.\n\n37:58.660 --> 38:00.980\n So I'm just going to sit here and do nothing.\n\n38:00.980 --> 38:04.660\n Okay, that's a possible solution except for the fact\n\n38:04.660 --> 38:06.380\n that somebody is going to do it.\n\n38:06.380 --> 38:10.500\n It's science and technology progresses.\n\n38:10.500 --> 38:14.780\n So we have to do it in an ethical way, in a good way,\n\n38:14.780 --> 38:17.820\n considering in a transparent way, in an open way,\n\n38:18.980 --> 38:23.780\n considering all the possible positive trajectories\n\n38:23.780 --> 38:26.380\n that could be taken and making sure as much as possible\n\n38:26.380 --> 38:28.260\n that we walk those trajectories.\n\n38:28.260 --> 38:31.100\n So yeah, I don't think Terminator is coming,\n\n38:31.100 --> 38:35.220\n but a totally unexpected version of Terminator\n\n38:35.220 --> 38:36.500\n may be around the corner.\n\n38:36.500 --> 38:37.340\n Might be here already.\n\n38:37.340 --> 38:38.980\n Yeah, so I agree with that.\n\n38:38.980 --> 38:41.460\n And so going back to the origin of life discussion,\n\n38:41.460 --> 38:44.500\n I think that in synthetic biology right now,\n\n38:44.500 --> 38:49.060\n we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes\n\n38:49.060 --> 38:51.460\n and edit synthetic biology to do things.\n\n38:51.460 --> 38:53.900\n So that's kind of, that's where things might go wrong\n\n38:53.900 --> 38:56.300\n in the same way as Twitter turning ourselves\n\n38:56.300 --> 38:59.460\n into kind of strange scale effects.\n\n38:59.460 --> 39:01.780\n I would love origin of life research\n\n39:01.780 --> 39:04.580\n or artificial life research to get to the point\n\n39:04.580 --> 39:06.820\n where we have those worries,\n\n39:06.820 --> 39:08.820\n because that's why I think we're just so far away from that.\n\n39:08.820 --> 39:10.700\n We are just, you know, right now,\n\n39:10.700 --> 39:13.100\n I think there are two really important angles.\n\n39:13.100 --> 39:15.860\n There is the origin of life people,\n\n39:15.860 --> 39:18.780\n researchers who are faithfully working on this\n\n39:18.780 --> 39:20.540\n and trying to make those molecules,\n\n39:20.540 --> 39:22.740\n the scan molecules I talked about.\n\n39:22.740 --> 39:24.860\n And then there are people on the creationist side\n\n39:24.860 --> 39:25.700\n who are saying, look,\n\n39:25.700 --> 39:26.940\n the fact you can't make these molecules\n\n39:26.940 --> 39:29.940\n and you can't make a cell means that evolution isn't true\n\n39:29.940 --> 39:30.780\n and all this other stuff.\n\n39:30.780 --> 39:31.620\n Gotcha.\n\n39:31.620 --> 39:34.180\n Yeah, and so, and I find that really frustrating\n\n39:34.180 --> 39:35.900\n because actually the origin of life research\n\n39:35.900 --> 39:37.820\n is all working in good faith, right?\n\n39:37.820 --> 39:38.660\n Yes.\n\n39:38.660 --> 39:40.100\n And so what I'm trying to do\n\n39:40.100 --> 39:41.860\n is give origin of life research\n\n39:41.860 --> 39:46.860\n a little bit more of an open context.\n\n39:47.180 --> 39:49.420\n And one of the things I think is important,\n\n39:49.420 --> 39:52.300\n I really want to make a new life form in my lifetime.\n\n39:52.300 --> 39:56.060\n I really want to prove that life is a general phenomena,\n\n39:56.060 --> 39:58.140\n a bit like gravity in the universe,\n\n39:58.140 --> 39:59.940\n because I think that's gonna be really important\n\n39:59.940 --> 40:04.900\n for humanity's global psychological state,\n\n40:04.900 --> 40:06.300\n meaning going forward.\n\n40:06.300 --> 40:09.100\n That's beautifully put.\n\n40:09.100 --> 40:12.500\n So one, it will help us understand ourselves.\n\n40:12.500 --> 40:14.220\n So that's useful for science,\n\n40:14.220 --> 40:17.660\n but two, it gives us a kind of hope,\n\n40:17.660 --> 40:22.660\n if not an awe at all the huge amounts\n\n40:23.980 --> 40:26.380\n of alien civilizations that are out there.\n\n40:26.380 --> 40:29.140\n If you can build life and understand\n\n40:29.140 --> 40:31.900\n just how easy it is to build life,\n\n40:31.900 --> 40:35.540\n then that's just as good, if not much better,\n\n40:35.540 --> 40:38.300\n than discovering life on another planet.\n\n40:38.300 --> 40:39.140\n Yeah.\n\n40:39.140 --> 40:41.620\n It's, I mean, it's cheaper.\n\n40:41.620 --> 40:44.460\n It's much cheaper and much easier\n\n40:44.460 --> 40:47.460\n and probably much more conclusive\n\n40:47.460 --> 40:50.020\n because once you're able to create life,\n\n40:50.020 --> 40:52.260\n like you said, it's a search problem\n\n40:52.260 --> 40:55.740\n that there's probably a lot of different ways to do it.\n\n40:55.740 --> 40:58.940\n Once you create the, once you find the first solution,\n\n40:58.940 --> 41:00.620\n you probably have all the right methodology\n\n41:00.620 --> 41:02.660\n for finding all kinds of other solutions.\n\n41:02.660 --> 41:03.740\n Yeah, and wouldn't it be great\n\n41:03.740 --> 41:04.860\n if we could find a solution?\n\n41:04.860 --> 41:07.580\n I mean, it's probably a bit late for,\n\n41:07.580 --> 41:09.060\n I mean, I worry about climate change,\n\n41:09.060 --> 41:10.660\n but I'm not that worried about climate change,\n\n41:10.660 --> 41:13.420\n and I think one day you could think about,\n\n41:13.420 --> 41:15.140\n could we engineer a new type of life form\n\n41:15.140 --> 41:17.900\n that could basically, and I don't want to do this,\n\n41:17.900 --> 41:19.460\n and I don't think we should do this necessarily,\n\n41:19.460 --> 41:21.180\n but it's a good thought experiment\n\n41:21.180 --> 41:23.620\n that would perhaps take CO2 out of the atmosphere\n\n41:23.620 --> 41:26.060\n or an intermediate life form, so it's not quite alive.\n\n41:26.060 --> 41:28.180\n It's almost like an add on\n\n41:28.180 --> 41:32.180\n that we can, with a time dependent add on,\n\n41:32.180 --> 41:35.060\n you could give to say cyanobacteria in the ocean\n\n41:35.060 --> 41:37.460\n or to maybe to wheat and say, right,\n\n41:37.460 --> 41:40.300\n we're just gonna, we're gonna fix a bit more CO2,\n\n41:40.300 --> 41:42.020\n and we're gonna work out how much we need to fix\n\n41:42.020 --> 41:44.580\n to basically save the climate,\n\n41:44.580 --> 41:47.620\n and we're gonna use evolutionary principles\n\n41:47.620 --> 41:49.500\n to basically get there.\n\n41:49.500 --> 41:51.900\n What worries me is that biology has had a few billion years\n\n41:51.900 --> 41:54.300\n to find a solution for CO2 fixation,\n\n41:54.300 --> 41:57.060\n hasn't really done, it's not,\n\n41:57.060 --> 41:58.900\n the solution isn't brilliant for our needs,\n\n41:58.900 --> 42:00.780\n but biology wasn't thinking about our needs.\n\n42:00.780 --> 42:03.180\n Biology was thinking about biology's needs,\n\n42:03.180 --> 42:05.180\n but I think if we can do, as you say,\n\n42:05.180 --> 42:08.460\n make life in the lab, then suddenly we don't need\n\n42:08.460 --> 42:10.940\n to go to everywhere and conclusively prove it.\n\n42:10.940 --> 42:12.420\n I think we make life in the lab.\n\n42:12.420 --> 42:14.300\n We look at the extent of life in the solar system.\n\n42:14.300 --> 42:16.460\n How far did Earth life get?\n\n42:16.460 --> 42:17.780\n Probably we're all Martians.\n\n42:17.780 --> 42:19.260\n Probably life got going on Mars.\n\n42:19.260 --> 42:21.220\n The chemistry on Mars seeded Earth.\n\n42:21.220 --> 42:22.940\n That might have been a legitimate way\n\n42:22.940 --> 42:25.540\n to kind of truncate the surface.\n\n42:25.540 --> 42:26.580\n But in the outer solar system,\n\n42:26.580 --> 42:28.340\n we might have completely different life forms\n\n42:28.340 --> 42:32.060\n on Enceladus, on Europa, and Titan.\n\n42:32.060 --> 42:33.380\n And that would be a cool thing, because.\n\n42:33.380 --> 42:36.380\n Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n42:36.380 --> 42:40.340\n Did you just say that you think, in terms of likelihood,\n\n42:40.340 --> 42:43.620\n life started on Mars, like statistically speaking,\n\n42:43.620 --> 42:45.860\n life started on Mars and seeded Earth?\n\n42:45.860 --> 42:48.380\n It could be possible, because life was,\n\n42:48.380 --> 42:50.980\n so Mars was habitable for the type of life\n\n42:50.980 --> 42:53.900\n that we have right now, type of chemistry before Earth.\n\n42:53.900 --> 42:57.020\n So it seems to me that Mars got searching,\n\n42:57.020 --> 42:59.580\n doing chemistry, like, and.\n\n42:59.580 --> 43:00.820\n It started way before.\n\n43:00.820 --> 43:03.060\n Yeah, and so they had a few more replicators\n\n43:03.060 --> 43:04.220\n and some other stuff.\n\n43:04.220 --> 43:06.340\n And if those replicators got ejected from Mars\n\n43:06.340 --> 43:09.220\n and landed on Earth, and Earth was like,\n\n43:09.220 --> 43:10.340\n I don't need to start again.\n\n43:10.340 --> 43:11.580\n Right.\n\n43:11.580 --> 43:12.420\n Thanks for that.\n\n43:12.420 --> 43:13.300\n And then it just carried on.\n\n43:13.300 --> 43:16.540\n So I'm not going, I think we will find evidence\n\n43:16.540 --> 43:20.060\n of life on Mars, either life we put there by mistake,\n\n43:20.060 --> 43:22.220\n contamination, or actually life,\n\n43:22.220 --> 43:24.500\n the earliest remnants of life.\n\n43:24.500 --> 43:26.020\n And that would be really exciting.\n\n43:26.020 --> 43:28.100\n It's a really good reason to go there.\n\n43:28.100 --> 43:29.580\n But I think it's more unlikely,\n\n43:29.580 --> 43:31.620\n because the gravitational situation in the solar system,\n\n43:31.620 --> 43:33.660\n if we find life in the outer solar system.\n\n43:33.660 --> 43:35.860\n Titan and all that, that would be its own thing.\n\n43:35.860 --> 43:36.700\n Exactly.\n\n43:36.700 --> 43:37.940\n Wow, that would be so cool.\n\n43:37.940 --> 43:40.820\n If we go to Mars and we find life that looks\n\n43:40.820 --> 43:43.020\n a hell of a lot similar to Earth life,\n\n43:43.020 --> 43:46.780\n and then we go to Titan and all those weird moons\n\n43:46.780 --> 43:49.060\n with the ices and the volcanoes and all that kind of stuff,\n\n43:49.060 --> 43:52.500\n and then we find there something that looks,\n\n43:52.500 --> 43:54.860\n I don't know, way weirder.\n\n43:54.860 --> 43:55.700\n Yeah.\n\n43:55.700 --> 43:57.660\n Some other, some non RNA type of situation.\n\n43:57.660 --> 43:59.580\n But we might find almost life,\n\n43:59.580 --> 44:01.900\n like in the prebiotic chemical space.\n\n44:01.900 --> 44:03.660\n And I think there are four types of exoplanets\n\n44:03.660 --> 44:04.540\n we need to look for, right?\n\n44:04.540 --> 44:07.220\n Because when JWST goes up and touch wood,\n\n44:07.220 --> 44:09.140\n it goes up and everything's fine.\n\n44:09.140 --> 44:12.020\n When we look at a star, well, we know statistically,\n\n44:12.020 --> 44:13.420\n most stars have planets around them.\n\n44:13.420 --> 44:14.680\n What type of planet are they?\n\n44:14.680 --> 44:16.380\n Are they going to be dead?\n\n44:16.380 --> 44:20.620\n Are they going to be just a prebiotic origin of life coming?\n\n44:20.620 --> 44:22.580\n So are they going to be technological?\n\n44:23.460 --> 44:27.260\n So with intelligence on them, and will they have died?\n\n44:27.260 --> 44:30.580\n So, you know, had life on them, but gone.\n\n44:30.580 --> 44:32.220\n Those are the four states of the boat.\n\n44:32.220 --> 44:34.940\n And suddenly, it's a bit like I want to classify planets\n\n44:34.940 --> 44:36.980\n the way we classify stars.\n\n44:36.980 --> 44:37.820\n Yeah.\n\n44:37.820 --> 44:39.660\n And I think that, in terms of their,\n\n44:39.660 --> 44:42.700\n rather than having this, oh, we've found methane,\n\n44:42.700 --> 44:43.540\n there's evidence of life.\n\n44:43.540 --> 44:45.300\n We found oxygen, that's the evidence of life.\n\n44:45.300 --> 44:47.900\n We found whatever molecule marker.\n\n44:47.900 --> 44:51.620\n And start to then frame things a little bit more.\n\n44:51.620 --> 44:52.980\n As those four states.\n\n44:52.980 --> 44:53.820\n Yeah.\n\n44:53.820 --> 44:55.140\n Which, by the way, you're just saying four,\n\n44:55.140 --> 44:58.760\n but there could be, before the dead,\n\n44:58.760 --> 45:00.100\n there could be other states\n\n45:00.100 --> 45:01.780\n that we humans can even conceive of.\n\n45:01.780 --> 45:04.580\n Yeah, yeah, just prebiotic, almost alive,\n\n45:04.580 --> 45:06.300\n got the possibility to come alive.\n\n45:06.300 --> 45:07.140\n I think.\n\n45:07.140 --> 45:08.780\n But there could be a post technological.\n\n45:08.780 --> 45:12.060\n Like, whatever we think of as technology,\n\n45:12.060 --> 45:16.860\n that could be a, like, pre conscious,\n\n45:17.860 --> 45:20.980\n like, where we all meld into one super intelligent conscious,\n\n45:20.980 --> 45:23.860\n or some weird thing that naturally happens over time.\n\n45:23.860 --> 45:24.700\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n45:24.700 --> 45:26.740\n I mean, I think that all bets are on that.\n\n45:26.740 --> 45:28.100\n The metaverse.\n\n45:28.100 --> 45:29.740\n Yeah, we are.\n\n45:29.740 --> 45:33.940\n We join into a virtual metaverse and start creating,\n\n45:33.940 --> 45:35.380\n which is kind of an interesting idea,\n\n45:35.380 --> 45:38.480\n almost arbitrary number of copies of each other,\n\n45:38.480 --> 45:41.940\n much more quickly, so we can mess with different ideas.\n\n45:41.940 --> 45:45.420\n Like, I can create a thousand copies of Lex,\n\n45:45.420 --> 45:48.060\n like, every possible version of Lex,\n\n45:48.060 --> 45:49.620\n and then just see, like,\n\n45:49.620 --> 45:52.300\n and then I just have them, like, argue with each other,\n\n45:52.300 --> 45:54.860\n and, like, until, like, in the space of ideas\n\n45:54.860 --> 45:56.340\n and see who wins out.\n\n45:56.340 --> 45:58.060\n How could that possibly go wrong?\n\n45:58.060 --> 46:01.620\n But anyway, there's, especially in this digital space\n\n46:01.620 --> 46:04.520\n where you could start exploring with AIs mixed in,\n\n46:04.520 --> 46:07.460\n you could start engineering arbitrary intelligences,\n\n46:07.460 --> 46:10.100\n you can start playing in the space of ideas,\n\n46:10.100 --> 46:13.900\n which might move us into a world that looks very different\n\n46:13.900 --> 46:15.020\n than a biological world.\n\n46:15.020 --> 46:17.600\n Like, our current world, the technology,\n\n46:17.600 --> 46:20.960\n is still very much tied to our biology.\n\n46:20.960 --> 46:23.540\n It's, we might move past that completely.\n\n46:23.540 --> 46:25.260\n Oh, definitely, we definitely will.\n\n46:25.260 --> 46:27.340\n We definitely, but that could be another phase then.\n\n46:27.340 --> 46:28.180\n Sure.\n\n46:28.180 --> 46:29.000\n Because then you, yeah.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:30.780\n But I did say technological, so I think I agree with you.\n\n46:30.780 --> 46:32.540\n I think, so you can have, let's get this right.\n\n46:32.540 --> 46:36.500\n So, dead world, no prospect of alive.\n\n46:36.500 --> 46:38.920\n Prebiotic world, life emerging.\n\n46:38.920 --> 46:40.900\n Living and technological.\n\n46:40.900 --> 46:42.180\n And you probably, and the dead one,\n\n46:42.180 --> 46:43.060\n you probably won't be able to tell\n\n46:43.060 --> 46:46.020\n between the dead never being alive and the dead one,\n\n46:46.020 --> 46:48.000\n maybe you've got some artifacts and maybe there's five.\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.400\n There's probably not more than five.\n\n46:50.400 --> 46:53.060\n And I think the technological one could allow,\n\n46:53.060 --> 46:54.300\n could have life on it still,\n\n46:54.300 --> 46:56.340\n but it might just have exceeded.\n\n46:56.340 --> 46:58.820\n Because, you know, one way that life might survive on Earth\n\n46:58.820 --> 47:01.780\n is if we can work out how to deal with the coming,\n\n47:01.780 --> 47:05.480\n the real climate change that comes when the sun expands.\n\n47:05.480 --> 47:10.420\n It might be a way to survive that, you know, but yeah.\n\n47:10.420 --> 47:12.420\n I think that we need to start thinking statistically\n\n47:12.420 --> 47:15.240\n when it comes to looking for life in the universe.\n\n47:15.240 --> 47:20.240\n Let me ask you then, sort of statistically,\n\n47:20.660 --> 47:23.860\n how many alien civilizations are out there\n\n47:23.860 --> 47:26.500\n in those four phases that you're talking about?\n\n47:26.500 --> 47:28.580\n When you look up to the stars\n\n47:28.580 --> 47:30.820\n and you're sipping on some wine\n\n47:30.820 --> 47:35.340\n and talking to other people with British accents\n\n47:35.340 --> 47:38.140\n about something intelligent and intellectual, I'm sure.\n\n47:39.860 --> 47:42.740\n Do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations\n\n47:42.740 --> 47:45.700\n looking back at us and wondering the same?\n\n47:45.700 --> 47:48.540\n My romantic view of the universe\n\n47:48.540 --> 47:52.240\n is really taking loans from my logical self.\n\n47:52.240 --> 47:55.500\n So what I'm saying is I have no doubt, I have no idea.\n\n47:55.500 --> 48:00.500\n But having said that, there is no reason to suppose\n\n48:01.520 --> 48:04.820\n that life is as hard as we first thought it was.\n\n48:04.820 --> 48:08.780\n And so if we just take Earth as a marker,\n\n48:08.780 --> 48:12.220\n and if I think that life is a much more general phenomena\n\n48:12.220 --> 48:13.300\n than just our biology,\n\n48:13.300 --> 48:16.700\n then I think the universe is full of life.\n\n48:16.700 --> 48:18.860\n And the reason for the Fermi paradox\n\n48:18.860 --> 48:22.220\n is not that they're not out there,\n\n48:22.220 --> 48:24.960\n it's just that we can't interact with the other life forms\n\n48:24.960 --> 48:27.020\n because they're so different.\n\n48:27.020 --> 48:28.980\n And I'm not saying that they're necessarily like\n\n48:28.980 --> 48:31.780\n hasn't depicted in Arrival or other, you know,\n\n48:31.780 --> 48:35.320\n I'm just saying that perhaps\n\n48:36.760 --> 48:40.120\n there are very few universal facts in the universe\n\n48:40.120 --> 48:45.120\n and maybe our technologies are quite divergent.\n\n48:47.440 --> 48:49.760\n And so I think that it's very hard to know\n\n48:49.760 --> 48:51.640\n how we're gonna interact with alien life.\n\n48:51.640 --> 48:54.120\n You think there's a lot of kinds of life that's possible.\n\n48:54.120 --> 48:57.360\n I guess that was the intuition you provided\n\n48:57.360 --> 49:02.360\n that the way biology itself,\n\n49:02.400 --> 49:04.680\n but even this particular kinds of biology\n\n49:04.680 --> 49:09.680\n that we have on Earth is something that is just one sample\n\n49:11.560 --> 49:15.560\n of nearly infinite number of other possible,\n\n49:15.560 --> 49:19.320\n complex, autonomous, self replicating type of things\n\n49:19.320 --> 49:20.680\n that could be possible.\n\n49:20.680 --> 49:24.320\n And so we're almost unable to see\n\n49:24.320 --> 49:28.480\n the alternative versions of us, huh?\n\n49:28.480 --> 49:31.840\n I mean, we'll still be able to detect them,\n\n49:31.840 --> 49:33.840\n we'll still be able to interact with them,\n\n49:33.840 --> 49:36.840\n we'll still be able to like which,\n\n49:36.840 --> 49:39.260\n what's exactly is lost in translation?\n\n49:39.260 --> 49:41.280\n Why can't we see them?\n\n49:41.280 --> 49:42.720\n Why can't we talk to them?\n\n49:42.720 --> 49:46.100\n Because I too have a sense,\n\n49:47.840 --> 49:49.760\n you put it way more poetically,\n\n49:49.760 --> 49:54.760\n but it seems both statistically\n\n49:54.880 --> 49:58.600\n and sort of romantically,\n\n49:58.600 --> 50:02.040\n it feels like the universe should be teeming with life,\n\n50:02.040 --> 50:04.460\n like super intelligent life.\n\n50:04.460 --> 50:09.460\n And I just, I sit there and the Fermi paradox is very,\n\n50:10.840 --> 50:12.880\n it's felt very distinctly by me\n\n50:12.880 --> 50:15.720\n when I look up at the stars because it's like,\n\n50:15.720 --> 50:18.480\n it's the same way I feel when I'm driving\n\n50:18.480 --> 50:20.560\n through New Jersey and listening to Bruce Springsteen\n\n50:20.560 --> 50:23.160\n and feel quite sad.\n\n50:23.160 --> 50:25.040\n It's like Lucy Kay talks about pulling off\n\n50:25.040 --> 50:27.700\n to the side of the road and just weeping a little bit.\n\n50:27.700 --> 50:31.180\n I'm almost like wondering like,\n\n50:31.180 --> 50:33.800\n hey, why aren't you talking to us?\n\n50:33.800 --> 50:35.600\n It feels lonely, it feels lonely\n\n50:35.600 --> 50:38.240\n because it feels like they're out there.\n\n50:38.240 --> 50:40.120\n I think that there are a number of answers to that.\n\n50:40.120 --> 50:42.520\n I think the Fermi paradox is perhaps based\n\n50:42.520 --> 50:47.240\n on the assumption that if life did emerge in the universe,\n\n50:47.240 --> 50:49.160\n it would be similar to our life\n\n50:49.160 --> 50:50.920\n and there's only one solution.\n\n50:50.920 --> 50:52.800\n And I think that what we've got to start to do\n\n50:52.800 --> 50:56.120\n is go out and look for selection detection\n\n50:56.120 --> 50:58.320\n rather than an evolution detection,\n\n50:58.320 --> 50:59.960\n rather than life detection.\n\n51:01.380 --> 51:03.440\n And I think that once we start to do that,\n\n51:03.440 --> 51:07.000\n we might start to see really interesting things.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.200\n And we haven't been doing this for very long\n\n51:10.200 --> 51:12.640\n and we are living in an expanding universe\n\n51:12.640 --> 51:15.680\n and that makes the problem a little bit harder.\n\n51:15.680 --> 51:19.820\n Everybody's always leaving distance wise.\n\n51:19.820 --> 51:22.880\n I'm very optimistic that we will,\n\n51:22.880 --> 51:25.800\n well, I don't know, there are two movies that came out\n\n51:25.800 --> 51:27.720\n within six months of one another,\n\n51:27.720 --> 51:30.200\n Ad Astra and Cosmos.\n\n51:30.200 --> 51:32.880\n Ad Astra, the very expensive blockbuster\n\n51:32.880 --> 51:35.880\n with Brad Pitt in it and saying there is no life\n\n51:35.880 --> 51:37.220\n and it's all, we've got to,\n\n51:37.220 --> 51:39.080\n life on Earth has more pressures than Cosmos,\n\n51:39.080 --> 51:40.360\n which is a UK production,\n\n51:40.360 --> 51:42.920\n which basically aliens came and visited Earth one day\n\n51:42.920 --> 51:45.120\n and they were discovered in the UK, right?\n\n51:45.120 --> 51:47.440\n It was quite, it's a fun film.\n\n51:48.440 --> 51:50.420\n But I really loved those two films.\n\n51:50.420 --> 51:53.560\n And at the same time, those films,\n\n51:53.560 --> 51:54.760\n at the time those films were coming out,\n\n51:54.760 --> 51:58.520\n I was working on a paper, a life detection paper,\n\n51:58.520 --> 52:02.020\n and I found it was so hard to publish this paper\n\n52:02.020 --> 52:03.680\n and it was almost as depressed,\n\n52:03.680 --> 52:06.500\n I got so depressed trying to get this science out there\n\n52:06.500 --> 52:11.320\n that I felt the depression of the film in Ad Astra,\n\n52:11.320 --> 52:14.720\n like life, there's no life elsewhere in the universe.\n\n52:14.720 --> 52:17.400\n And, but I'm incredibly optimistic\n\n52:17.400 --> 52:19.320\n that I think we will find life in the universe,\n\n52:19.320 --> 52:21.040\n firm evidence of life,\n\n52:21.040 --> 52:22.440\n and it will have to start on Earth,\n\n52:22.440 --> 52:24.360\n making life on Earth and surprising us.\n\n52:24.360 --> 52:25.680\n We have to surprise ourselves\n\n52:25.680 --> 52:28.440\n and make non biological life on Earth.\n\n52:28.440 --> 52:31.400\n And then people say, well, you made this life on Earth,\n\n52:31.400 --> 52:34.380\n therefore it's, you're part of the causal chain of that.\n\n52:34.380 --> 52:35.600\n And that might be true,\n\n52:35.600 --> 52:38.920\n but if I can show how I'm able to do it\n\n52:38.920 --> 52:40.800\n with very little cheating\n\n52:40.800 --> 52:42.380\n or very little information inputs,\n\n52:42.380 --> 52:44.660\n just creating like a model planet.\n\n52:44.660 --> 52:48.520\n Some description and watching it, watching life emerge,\n\n52:48.520 --> 52:51.140\n then I think that we will be even to persuade\n\n52:51.140 --> 52:55.080\n even the hardest critic that it's possible.\n\n52:55.080 --> 52:57.660\n Now, with regards to the Fermi paradox,\n\n52:57.660 --> 53:01.400\n I think that we might crush that with the JWST.\n\n53:01.400 --> 53:03.120\n It's basically, if I recall correctly,\n\n53:03.120 --> 53:06.440\n the mirror is about 10 times the size of the Hubble\n\n53:06.440 --> 53:09.020\n that we're gonna be able to do spectroscopy,\n\n53:09.020 --> 53:12.680\n look at colors of exoplanets, I think, not brilliantly,\n\n53:12.680 --> 53:15.280\n but we'll be able to start to classify them.\n\n53:15.280 --> 53:18.860\n And we'll start to get a real feel\n\n53:18.860 --> 53:21.400\n for what's going on in the universe on these exoplanets.\n\n53:21.400 --> 53:25.200\n Cause it's only in the last few decades, I think,\n\n53:25.200 --> 53:27.600\n maybe even last decade that we even\n\n53:30.320 --> 53:33.880\n came to recognize that exoplanets even are common.\n\n53:33.880 --> 53:36.160\n And I think that that gives us a lot of optimism\n\n53:36.160 --> 53:38.660\n that life is gonna be out there.\n\n53:38.660 --> 53:40.560\n But I think we have to start framing,\n\n53:40.560 --> 53:44.040\n we have to start preparing the fact\n\n53:44.040 --> 53:46.920\n that biology is only one solution.\n\n53:46.920 --> 53:50.640\n I can tell you with confidence that biology on Earth\n\n53:50.640 --> 53:52.620\n does not exist anywhere else in the universe.\n\n53:52.620 --> 53:54.680\n We are absolutely unique.\n\n53:54.680 --> 53:56.840\n Well, okay, I love the confidence,\n\n53:56.840 --> 54:01.840\n but where does that confidence come from?\n\n54:02.400 --> 54:07.400\n Chemistry, like how many options does chemistry really have?\n\n54:07.640 --> 54:08.880\n Many, that's the point.\n\n54:08.880 --> 54:11.160\n And the thing is, this is where the origin of life scam\n\n54:11.160 --> 54:15.140\n comes in, is that people don't quite count,\n\n54:15.140 --> 54:16.240\n they don't count the numbers.\n\n54:16.240 --> 54:19.980\n So if biology as you find on Earth is common everywhere,\n\n54:19.980 --> 54:21.600\n then there's something really weird going on\n\n54:21.600 --> 54:23.940\n that basically written in the quantum mechanics,\n\n54:23.940 --> 54:26.680\n there's some kind of these bonds must form over these bonds\n\n54:26.680 --> 54:28.280\n and this catalyst must form over this catalyst\n\n54:28.280 --> 54:30.160\n when they're all quite equal.\n\n54:30.160 --> 54:31.840\n Life is contingent.\n\n54:31.840 --> 54:34.560\n The origin of life on Earth was contingent\n\n54:34.560 --> 54:38.600\n upon the chemistry available at the origin of life on Earth.\n\n54:38.600 --> 54:43.360\n So that means if we want to find other Earth like worlds,\n\n54:43.360 --> 54:45.120\n we look for the same kind of rocky world.\n\n54:45.120 --> 54:47.840\n We might look in the same zone as Earth\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:50.320\n and we might expect reasonably\n\n54:50.320 --> 54:53.840\n to find biological like stuff going on.\n\n54:53.840 --> 54:55.540\n That would be a reasonable hypothesis,\n\n54:55.540 --> 54:57.360\n but it won't be the same, it can't be.\n\n54:57.360 --> 55:00.480\n It's like saying, I don't believe in magic.\n\n55:00.480 --> 55:02.520\n That's why I'm sure.\n\n55:02.520 --> 55:03.680\n I just don't believe in magic.\n\n55:03.680 --> 55:06.000\n I believe in statistics and I can do experiments.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:09.680\n And so I won't get the same, exactly the same sequence\n\n55:09.680 --> 55:11.440\n of events, I'll get something different.\n\n55:11.440 --> 55:14.400\n And so there is TikTok elsewhere in the universe,\n\n55:14.400 --> 55:16.600\n but it's not the same as our TikTok, right?\n\n55:16.600 --> 55:17.840\n That's what I mean.\n\n55:17.840 --> 55:20.160\n Which aspect of it is not the same?\n\n55:20.160 --> 55:23.480\n Well, I just think, so what is TikTok?\n\n55:23.480 --> 55:27.040\n TikTok is a social media where people upload videos, right?\n\n55:27.040 --> 55:28.100\n Of silly videos.\n\n55:28.100 --> 55:29.440\n So I guess there might be.\n\n55:29.440 --> 55:31.000\n Well, there's humor, there's attention,\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.080\n there's the ability to process,\n\n55:33.080 --> 55:35.480\n there's ability for intelligent organisms\n\n55:35.480 --> 55:38.640\n to collaborate on ideas and find human ideas\n\n55:38.640 --> 55:41.900\n and play with those ideas, make them viral, memes.\n\n55:43.760 --> 55:45.400\n Humor seems to be kind of fundamental\n\n55:45.400 --> 55:46.600\n to the human experience.\n\n55:46.600 --> 55:48.820\n And I think that that's a really interesting question\n\n55:48.820 --> 55:52.360\n we can ask, is humor a fundamental thing in the universe?\n\n55:52.360 --> 55:53.640\n I think maybe it will be, right?\n\n55:53.640 --> 55:56.800\n In terms of, you think about in a game theoretic sense,\n\n55:56.800 --> 56:00.440\n humor, the emergence of humor serves a role\n\n56:00.440 --> 56:01.640\n in our game engine.\n\n56:01.640 --> 56:05.000\n And so if selection is fundamental in the universe,\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:05.840\n so is humor.\n\n56:06.920 --> 56:10.280\n Well, I actually don't know exactly\n\n56:10.280 --> 56:12.520\n what role humor serves.\n\n56:12.520 --> 56:15.320\n Maybe it's like, from a chemical perspective,\n\n56:15.320 --> 56:19.280\n it's like a catalyst for,\n\n56:20.320 --> 56:21.480\n I guess it's for several purposes.\n\n56:21.480 --> 56:23.720\n One is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet.\n\n56:23.720 --> 56:25.480\n That's modern humor.\n\n56:25.480 --> 56:28.220\n But humor is also a good way to deal\n\n56:28.220 --> 56:30.800\n with the difficulty of life.\n\n56:30.800 --> 56:35.560\n It's a kind of valve, release valve for suffering.\n\n56:35.560 --> 56:39.080\n Throughout human history, life has been really hard.\n\n56:39.080 --> 56:41.200\n And for the people that I've known in my life\n\n56:41.200 --> 56:44.780\n who've lived through some really difficult things,\n\n56:44.780 --> 56:47.400\n humor is part of how they deal with that.\n\n56:47.400 --> 56:49.320\n It's usually dark humor.\n\n56:49.320 --> 56:51.480\n But yeah, it's interesting.\n\n56:51.480 --> 56:56.040\n I don't know exactly what's the more mathematically\n\n56:56.040 --> 56:58.840\n general way to formulate what the hell is humor.\n\n56:58.840 --> 57:01.040\n What humor does it serve?\n\n57:01.040 --> 57:03.800\n But I still, we're kind of joking here,\n\n57:03.800 --> 57:08.800\n but it's a counterintuitive idea to me\n\n57:09.800 --> 57:14.640\n to think that life elsewhere in the universe\n\n57:14.640 --> 57:17.440\n is very different than life on Earth.\n\n57:17.440 --> 57:22.440\n And also, like all of each instantiation of life\n\n57:23.400 --> 57:26.000\n is likely very different from each other.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:30.480\n Yeah, like maybe there's a few clusters of similar life,\n\n57:30.480 --> 57:34.160\n but it's much more likely is what you're saying.\n\n57:34.160 --> 57:36.180\n To me, it's a kind of novel thought.\n\n57:36.180 --> 57:37.520\n I'm not sure what to do with it.\n\n57:37.520 --> 57:40.360\n But you're saying that it's more common\n\n57:40.360 --> 57:44.860\n to be a weird outcast in the full spectrum of life\n\n57:44.860 --> 57:48.140\n than it is to be in some usual cluster.\n\n57:48.140 --> 57:51.520\n So every instantiation of a kind of chemistry\n\n57:51.520 --> 57:53.440\n that results in complexity that's autonomous\n\n57:53.440 --> 57:56.880\n and self replicating however the hell you define life,\n\n57:56.880 --> 57:59.700\n that is going to be very different every time.\n\n57:59.700 --> 58:00.540\n I don't know.\n\n58:01.400 --> 58:04.960\n It feels like a selection is a fundamental\n\n58:04.960 --> 58:07.940\n kind of directed force in the universe.\n\n58:07.940 --> 58:11.520\n Won't selection result in a few pockets\n\n58:11.520 --> 58:13.440\n of interesting complexities?\n\n58:13.440 --> 58:18.440\n I mean, yeah, if we ran Earth over again,\n\n58:19.960 --> 58:20.880\n over and over and over,\n\n58:20.880 --> 58:23.080\n you're saying it's going to come up with,\n\n58:23.080 --> 58:26.000\n there's not going to be elephants every time?\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:27.480\n Yeah, I don't think so.\n\n58:27.480 --> 58:30.520\n I think that there will be similarities.\n\n58:30.520 --> 58:32.260\n And I think we don't know enough\n\n58:32.260 --> 58:36.520\n about how selection globally works.\n\n58:37.880 --> 58:42.080\n But it might be that the emergence of elephants\n\n58:42.080 --> 58:44.400\n was wired into the history of Earth in some way,\n\n58:44.400 --> 58:47.920\n like the gravitational force, how evolution was going,\n\n58:47.920 --> 58:49.360\n Cambrian explosions, blah, blah, blah,\n\n58:49.360 --> 58:50.760\n the emergence of mammals.\n\n58:50.760 --> 58:53.720\n But I just don't know enough about the contingency,\n\n58:53.720 --> 58:54.920\n the variability.\n\n58:54.920 --> 58:57.260\n All I do know is you count the number of bits\n\n58:57.260 --> 59:00.600\n of information required to make an elephant\n\n59:00.600 --> 59:03.600\n and think about the causal chain\n\n59:03.600 --> 59:05.700\n that provide the lineage of elephants\n\n59:05.700 --> 59:07.760\n going all the way back to Luca,\n\n59:07.760 --> 59:10.360\n there's a huge scope for divergence.\n\n59:10.360 --> 59:15.040\n Yeah, but just like you said, with chemistry and selection,\n\n59:15.040 --> 59:20.040\n the things that result in self replicating chemistry\n\n59:22.840 --> 59:24.880\n and self replicating organisms,\n\n59:26.520 --> 59:29.360\n those are extremely unlikely, as you're saying.\n\n59:30.520 --> 59:33.100\n But once they're successful, they multiply.\n\n59:33.100 --> 59:37.640\n So it might be a tiny subset of all things\n\n59:37.640 --> 59:40.080\n that are possible in the universe, chemically speaking,\n\n59:40.080 --> 59:41.800\n it might be a very tiny subset\n\n59:41.800 --> 59:44.600\n is actually successful at creating elephants.\n\n59:44.600 --> 59:48.040\n Or elephant like or slash human like creatures.\n\n59:48.040 --> 59:48.880\n Well, there's two different questions here.\n\n59:48.880 --> 59:52.920\n The first one, if we were to reset Earth and to start again.\n\n59:52.920 --> 59:54.920\n The different phases, sorry to keep interrupting.\n\n59:54.920 --> 59:56.880\n Yeah, no, if we restart Earth and start again,\n\n59:56.880 --> 59:58.600\n say we could go back to the beginning\n\n59:58.600 --> 1:00:00.920\n and do the experiment or have a number of Earths,\n\n1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:02.600\n how similar would biology be?\n\n1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:06.420\n I would say that there would be broad similarities,\n\n1:00:06.420 --> 1:00:09.120\n but the emergence of mammals is not a given\n\n1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:11.520\n unless we're gonna throw an asteroid at each planet\n\n1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:15.760\n at each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happened.\n\n1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:17.960\n Then there's the other thing about\n\n1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:20.440\n when you go to another Earth like planet elsewhere,\n\n1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:22.920\n maybe there's a different ratio, particular elements,\n\n1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:27.240\n maybe the bombardment at the beginning of the planet\n\n1:00:27.240 --> 1:00:30.440\n was quicker or longer than Earth.\n\n1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:32.800\n And I just don't have enough information there.\n\n1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:37.800\n What I do know is that the complexity of the story of life\n\n1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:42.280\n on Earth gives us lots of scope for variation.\n\n1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:44.540\n And I just don't think it's a reasonable\n\n1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:48.960\n mathematical assumption to think that life on Earth\n\n1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:51.560\n that happened again would be same as what we have now.\n\n1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:54.520\n Okay, but you've also extended that to say\n\n1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:58.440\n that we might, as an explanation for the Fermi paradox,\n\n1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:02.680\n that that means we're not able to interact with them.\n\n1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:06.680\n Or that's an explanation for why we haven't at scale\n\n1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:10.520\n heard from aliens is they're different than us.\n\n1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:13.480\n We've only been looking for, say, 70, 80 years.\n\n1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.440\n So I think that the reason we have not found aliens yet\n\n1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:20.000\n is that we haven't worked out what life is.\n\n1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.980\n No, but the aliens have worked that out, surely.\n\n1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:29.360\n Statistically speaking, there must be a large number\n\n1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:31.800\n of aliens that are way ahead of us\n\n1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:33.520\n on this whole life question.\n\n1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:37.320\n Unless there's something about this stage\n\n1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:40.900\n of intellectual evolution that often quickly results\n\n1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:42.560\n in nuclear war and destroys itself.\n\n1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:47.560\n Like there's something in this process\n\n1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:52.440\n that eventually, I don't know, crystallizes the complexity\n\n1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:55.800\n and it stops, either dies or stops developing.\n\n1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:58.140\n But most likely, they already figured it out.\n\n1:01:58.140 --> 1:01:59.840\n And why aren't they contacting us?\n\n1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:03.320\n Is it some grad student somewhere?\n\n1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:06.520\n Wants to study a new green planet?\n\n1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:07.840\n Maybe they have.\n\n1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:12.160\n I mean, I don't have a coherent answer to your question,\n\n1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:15.480\n other than to say that if there are other aliens out there\n\n1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:17.600\n and they're far more advanced,\n\n1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:19.920\n they might be in contact with each other.\n\n1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:22.480\n And they might also, we might be at a point\n\n1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.640\n where what I'm saying quite critically\n\n1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:26.840\n is it takes two to talk, right?\n\n1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:28.080\n So the aliens might be there.\n\n1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:31.220\n But if we don't have the ability to recognize them\n\n1:02:31.220 --> 1:02:33.680\n and talk to them, then the aliens aren't going\n\n1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:36.080\n to want to talk to us.\n\n1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:37.560\n And I think that's a critical point\n\n1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:42.180\n that probably if that's a filter,\n\n1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:44.440\n there needs to be an ability for one\n\n1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:45.760\n to communicate with the other.\n\n1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:48.240\n And we need to know what life is before we do that.\n\n1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:50.880\n So we haven't qualified to even join the club\n\n1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:51.840\n to have a talk.\n\n1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:54.840\n Well, I think they still wanna teach us how to talk, right?\n\n1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:59.840\n But my worry is that, or I think they would wanna teach us\n\n1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:02.240\n how to talk like you do when you meet it.\n\n1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:07.960\n Like when you even meet, I was gonna say child,\n\n1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:09.720\n but that's a human species.\n\n1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:11.360\n I mean like ant.\n\n1:03:12.620 --> 1:03:15.640\n You want to try to communicate with them\n\n1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:17.400\n through whatever devices you can,\n\n1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:19.360\n given what an ant is like.\n\n1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:21.880\n I just, I worry mostly about that humans\n\n1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:25.020\n are just too close minded or don't have the right tools.\n\n1:03:25.020 --> 1:03:27.200\n No, I'm gonna push back on this quite significantly.\n\n1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.640\n I would say, because we don't understand what life is\n\n1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.400\n and because we don't understand\n\n1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:34.200\n how life emerged in the universe,\n\n1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:36.080\n we don't understand the physics\n\n1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:38.040\n that gave rise to life yet.\n\n1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:40.640\n That means our fundamental description,\n\n1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:43.320\n I'm way out of my pay grade, even further out.\n\n1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.160\n But I'll say it anyway,\n\n1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:44.980\n because I think it's a fun.\n\n1:03:44.980 --> 1:03:47.320\n You don't get paid much anyway, as you said earlier.\n\n1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:50.960\n So I would say that we,\n\n1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:52.920\n because we don't understand the universe yet,\n\n1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:56.040\n we do not understand how the universe spat out life.\n\n1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:57.640\n And we don't know what life is.\n\n1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.760\n And I think that until we understand that,\n\n1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:01.960\n it is gonna limit our ability to even,\n\n1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:05.880\n we don't qualify to talk to the aliens.\n\n1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:08.440\n So I'm gonna say that they might be there,\n\n1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:10.560\n but we just, I'm not gonna say that I believe\n\n1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.440\n in interdimensional aliens being present in this room.\n\n1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:14.800\n Yeah, but I think you're just being self critical,\n\n1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:15.840\n like we don't qualify.\n\n1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:19.320\n I think the fact that we don't qualify qualifies us.\n\n1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:22.040\n We're interesting in our innocence.\n\n1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:25.720\n No, I'm saying that because we don't understand\n\n1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:27.720\n causal chains and the way that information\n\n1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:29.320\n is propagated in the universe.\n\n1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:31.160\n And we don't understand what replication is yet.\n\n1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:35.120\n And we don't understand how life emerged.\n\n1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:38.720\n I think that we would not recognize aliens.\n\n1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:42.140\n And if someone doesn't recognize you,\n\n1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:44.320\n you wouldn't go and talk to it.\n\n1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:46.680\n You don't go and talk to ants.\n\n1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:48.240\n You don't go and talk to birds\n\n1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:49.760\n or maybe some birds you do, right?\n\n1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:52.160\n Cause you can, there's just enough cognition.\n\n1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:55.080\n So I'm saying because we don't have enough,\n\n1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:58.720\n our cognitive abilities are not yet where they need to be.\n\n1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:00.200\n We probably haven't been communicating with them.\n\n1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.880\n So you don't agree with the dating strategy\n\n1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:04.640\n of playing hard to get?\n\n1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:07.400\n Cause us humans, that seems to attract us.\n\n1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:09.240\n Within a species, that's fine.\n\n1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:11.660\n But I think we don't actually have abstraction.\n\n1:05:11.660 --> 1:05:15.600\n No, actually I think in this talk, in this conversation,\n\n1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:16.920\n you've helped me crystallize something\n\n1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:19.240\n that I think has been troubling me for a long time\n\n1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:20.160\n with the thermi paradox.\n\n1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:23.840\n I'm pretty sure that a reasonable avenue\n\n1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:28.480\n is to say that you would not go and talk to your cat\n\n1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:31.160\n about calculus, right?\n\n1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:32.280\n But I would still pet it.\n\n1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:34.280\n Sure, but I'm not talking about petting a cat.\n\n1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:37.160\n The analogy is that the aliens are not going to talk to us\n\n1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:40.020\n because we, and I'm using calculus as analogy\n\n1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:44.280\n for abstraction because we lack the layer,\n\n1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:47.400\n the fundamental layer of understanding what life is\n\n1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:50.280\n and what the universe is in our reality\n\n1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:52.840\n that it would be so counterproductive\n\n1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:55.280\n interacting with intelligent alien species\n\n1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:58.860\n that it would cause more angst for human race.\n\n1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:00.780\n They don't care.\n\n1:06:00.780 --> 1:06:03.060\n Okay, they gotta be self interested.\n\n1:06:03.060 --> 1:06:05.240\n So they'll probably, they more care about\n\n1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:06.880\n is it interesting for them?\n\n1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:10.680\n Maybe they, I mean, surely there's a way\n\n1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:15.680\n to pet the cat in this analogy\n\n1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:20.840\n because even if we lack complete understanding,\n\n1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:23.160\n it must be a very frustrating experience\n\n1:06:23.160 --> 1:06:26.760\n for other kinds of intelligence to communicate with us.\n\n1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:29.640\n Still, there must be a way to interact with us.\n\n1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:30.480\n Well.\n\n1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:34.280\n Like perturb the system in interesting ways\n\n1:06:34.280 --> 1:06:35.820\n to see what these creatures do.\n\n1:06:35.820 --> 1:06:37.440\n We might actually find the answer.\n\n1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:39.280\n I mean, again, out of my pay grade,\n\n1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:42.560\n in a simulation of the Earth,\n\n1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:44.900\n let's say a simulation where we allow\n\n1:06:44.900 --> 1:06:47.160\n an intelligent AI to emerge, right?\n\n1:06:47.160 --> 1:06:52.160\n And that AI, we then give it the objective\n\n1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:54.980\n is to be curious, interact with other intelligence\n\n1:06:54.980 --> 1:06:56.200\n in its universe.\n\n1:06:56.200 --> 1:07:00.900\n And then we might find the parameters required\n\n1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:02.420\n for that AI to walk with.\n\n1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:05.320\n And I think you'll find if the AI will not talk\n\n1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:08.780\n to other AIs that don't share the ability\n\n1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:10.400\n to abstract at the level of the AI\n\n1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:13.280\n because it's just a cat and are you gonna travel\n\n1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.320\n 20 light years to go and pet a cat?\n\n1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:19.200\n So not because of the inability to do so,\n\n1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:20.840\n but because of like boredom.\n\n1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:23.920\n It's more interested, it will start talking to,\n\n1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:28.040\n it will spend most, it will spend a majority\n\n1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:30.280\n of its time talking to other AI systems\n\n1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:32.360\n that can at least somewhat understand\n\n1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:33.200\n and it's much more fun.\n\n1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:34.960\n It's a bit like, do we know that plants are conscious?\n\n1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:36.960\n Well, plants are unconscious in the way we typically think,\n\n1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:37.800\n but we don't talk to them.\n\n1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:38.640\n They could be, right?\n\n1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:40.080\n Yeah, but there's a lot of people on Earth\n\n1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:41.120\n who like gardening.\n\n1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:42.800\n There's always going to be a weird.\n\n1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:44.160\n They're not talking, they're just gardening.\n\n1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:46.240\n Okay, well, you're not romantic enough\n\n1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:48.120\n to see gardening as a way of communication\n\n1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:48.960\n between humans and plants.\n\n1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:50.320\n Oh, okay, you've got me there.\n\n1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:53.120\n But there's ways, there's always going to be\n\n1:07:53.120 --> 1:07:55.000\n the people who are curious.\n\n1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.520\n Jane Goodall who lives with the chimps, right?\n\n1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:00.900\n There's always going to be curious intelligent species\n\n1:08:00.900 --> 1:08:05.900\n that visit the weird Earth planet and try to interact.\n\n1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:10.360\n I mean, it's a, yeah, I think it's a super cool idea\n\n1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:11.180\n that you're expressing.\n\n1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:13.000\n I just kind of have a sense.\n\n1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:16.120\n Maybe it's a hope that there's always going to be\n\n1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:18.160\n a desire to interact even with those\n\n1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:21.360\n that can't possibly understand the depth\n\n1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:22.960\n of what you understand.\n\n1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.680\n So I'm with you, so I want to be as positive as you\n\n1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:29.340\n that aliens do exist and we will interact with them.\n\n1:08:29.340 --> 1:08:30.800\n What I'm trying to do is to give you\n\n1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:35.000\n a reasonable hypothesis why we haven't yet.\n\n1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:35.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:38.840\n And also something to strive for to be able to do that.\n\n1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:41.720\n I mean, you know, there is the other view\n\n1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.760\n that the universe is just too big\n\n1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:46.060\n and life is just too rare.\n\n1:08:46.060 --> 1:08:49.280\n But I want to come up with an alternative explanation\n\n1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:53.200\n which I think is reasonable and not being philosophically\n\n1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:55.940\n and scientifically thought out, which is this,\n\n1:08:55.940 --> 1:08:59.220\n if you can't actually communicate with the object,\n\n1:08:59.220 --> 1:09:03.480\n the thing competently, you don't even know it's there,\n\n1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:05.160\n then there's no point yet.\n\n1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:07.440\n See, I disagree with that, but I'm totally aligned\n\n1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:09.040\n with your hopeful vision, which is like,\n\n1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:11.520\n we need to understand the origin of life.\n\n1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:13.440\n It will help us engineer life.\n\n1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:16.320\n It will help us engineer intelligent life through perhaps\n\n1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:18.560\n on the computer side through simulation\n\n1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:20.920\n and explore all the ways that life emerges.\n\n1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:24.120\n And that will allow us to, I think the fundamental reason\n\n1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:27.160\n we don't see overwhelming amounts of life\n\n1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:31.160\n is I actually believe aliens,\n\n1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:35.760\n of course, these are all just kind of open minded beliefs.\n\n1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:37.960\n It's difficult to know for sure about any of this,\n\n1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:40.920\n but I think there's a lot of alien civilizations\n\n1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:44.640\n which are actively communicating with us and we're too dumb.\n\n1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:47.720\n We don't have the right tools to see it.\n\n1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:48.560\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:51.880\n No, but maybe I misinterpreted you,\n\n1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:56.240\n but I interpreted you to say they kind of tried a few times\n\n1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:57.520\n and they're like, oh God.\n\n1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:00.680\n No, no, no, what I'm saying is we, so this goes two ways.\n\n1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:01.780\n Yeah, I agree with you.\n\n1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:03.860\n There could be information out there,\n\n1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:05.000\n but just put in such a way\n\n1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.600\n that we just don't understand it yet.\n\n1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:07.440\n Right.\n\n1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:09.260\n So sorry if I didn't make that clear.\n\n1:10:09.260 --> 1:10:11.120\n I mean, it's not just, I don't think we,\n\n1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:15.600\n I think we qualify as soon as we can decode their signal.\n\n1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:17.880\n Right, so when you say qualify, got it, got it.\n\n1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:19.680\n So you mean, we're just not smart enough,\n\n1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:21.320\n the word qualify was throwing me off.\n\n1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:22.520\n So we're not smart enough to do,\n\n1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:25.240\n it's like we just need to get smarter.\n\n1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:27.440\n And there's a lot of people who believe,\n\n1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:31.640\n let me get your opinion on this, about UFO sightings.\n\n1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:36.640\n So sightings of weird phenomena\n\n1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:41.640\n that, you know, what does UFO mean?\n\n1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:45.040\n It means it's a flying object\n\n1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:50.040\n and it's not identified clearly at the time of sighting.\n\n1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:51.800\n That's what UFO means.\n\n1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:53.760\n So it could be a physics phenomena,\n\n1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:54.640\n it could be ball lightning,\n\n1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:56.440\n it could be all kinds of fascinating.\n\n1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:58.840\n I was always fascinated with ball lightning as a,\n\n1:11:00.420 --> 1:11:03.160\n like the fact that there could be physical phenomena\n\n1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:06.320\n in this world that are observable by the human eye.\n\n1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.640\n Of course, all physical phenomena generally are fascinating\n\n1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:14.160\n that really smart people can't explain.\n\n1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:15.080\n I love that.\n\n1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:16.560\n Cause it's like, wait a minute,\n\n1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:18.560\n especially if you can replicate it,\n\n1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:20.160\n it's like, wait a minute, how does this happen?\n\n1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:23.600\n That's like the precursor to giant discoveries\n\n1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:25.980\n in chemistry and biology and physics and so on.\n\n1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:29.560\n But it sucks when those events are super rare, right?\n\n1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:31.340\n Physically, like ball lightning.\n\n1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:34.200\n So that's out there.\n\n1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:36.440\n And then of course that phenomena\n\n1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:37.920\n could have other interpretations\n\n1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:40.280\n that don't have to do with the physics of chemistry,\n\n1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:42.200\n the biology of earth.\n\n1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:43.360\n It could have to do\n\n1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.840\n with more extraterrestrial explanations\n\n1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:50.480\n that in large part, thanks to Hollywood and movies\n\n1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:51.760\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:54.320\n captivates the imaginations of millions of people.\n\n1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:58.640\n But just because it's science fiction\n\n1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:00.440\n that captivates the imagination of people,\n\n1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:03.520\n it doesn't mean that some of those sightings,\n\n1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:05.340\n all it takes is one.\n\n1:12:05.340 --> 1:12:09.160\n One of those sightings is actually a sign\n\n1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:11.960\n that it's extraterrestrial intelligence,\n\n1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:16.960\n that it's object that's not of this particular world.\n\n1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:18.960\n Do you think there's a chance that that's the case?\n\n1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:21.180\n What do you make, especially the pilot sightings,\n\n1:12:21.180 --> 1:12:22.520\n what do you make of those?\n\n1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:26.040\n So I agree with there's a chance.\n\n1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:26.860\n There's always a chance.\n\n1:12:26.860 --> 1:12:29.400\n Any good scientist would have to,\n\n1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:31.200\n or observationist would have to,\n\n1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:36.160\n I want to see if aliens exist come to earth.\n\n1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:37.880\n What I know about the universe\n\n1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:40.000\n is I think it's unlikely right now\n\n1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.520\n that there are aliens visiting us, but not impossible.\n\n1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:48.560\n I think the releases, the dramatization\n\n1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:49.880\n that's been happening politically\n\n1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:51.640\n saying we're gonna release all this information,\n\n1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:53.620\n this classified information.\n\n1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:55.880\n I was kind of disappointed\n\n1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:00.880\n because it was just very poor material.\n\n1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:07.040\n And right now, the ability to capture high resolution video,\n\n1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:10.320\n everybody is carrying around\n\n1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:12.480\n with them an incredible video device now.\n\n1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:17.480\n And we haven't got more compelling data.\n\n1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:22.680\n And so that we've just seeing grainy pictures,\n\n1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:26.440\n a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions\n\n1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:27.280\n and whatnot.\n\n1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:30.660\n And so I think on balance, I think it's extremely unlikely,\n\n1:13:30.660 --> 1:13:33.360\n but I think something really interesting is happening.\n\n1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:36.400\n And then also during the pandemic, right?\n\n1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:37.480\n We've all been locked down.\n\n1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:38.320\n We all want to have,\n\n1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:42.120\n we want to, our imaginations are running riot.\n\n1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:44.120\n And I think that the,\n\n1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:46.280\n I don't think that the information out there\n\n1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:47.600\n has convinced me there are any,\n\n1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:49.680\n anything interesting on the UFO side.\n\n1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:51.760\n But what it has made me very interested about\n\n1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:56.760\n is how humanity is opening up its mind to ponder aliens\n\n1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:00.480\n and the mystery of our universe.\n\n1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:02.720\n And so I don't want to dissuade people\n\n1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:04.440\n from having those thoughts and say, you're stupid\n\n1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:06.140\n and look at that, it's clearly incorrect.\n\n1:14:06.140 --> 1:14:06.980\n That's not right.\n\n1:14:06.980 --> 1:14:07.820\n That's not fair.\n\n1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:10.880\n What I would say is that I lack sufficient data,\n\n1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.080\n replicated observations to make me go,\n\n1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:16.600\n oh, I'm gonna take this seriously,\n\n1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:18.260\n but I'm really interested by the fact\n\n1:14:18.260 --> 1:14:21.600\n that there is this great deal of interest.\n\n1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:24.640\n And I think that it drives me\n\n1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:28.600\n to maybe want to make an artificial life form even more\n\n1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:31.520\n and to help NASA and the Air Force\n\n1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:33.280\n and whoever go and look for things even more,\n\n1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:36.140\n because I think humanity wants to know what's out there.\n\n1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:38.200\n There's this yearning, isn't there?\n\n1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:41.080\n Yeah, but I see, I almost,\n\n1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:45.440\n depending on the day, I sometimes agree with you,\n\n1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:47.840\n but with the thing you just said,\n\n1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:52.680\n but one of the disappointing things to me\n\n1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:56.000\n about the sightings, I still hold the belief\n\n1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.120\n that a nonzero number of them\n\n1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:04.920\n is an indication of something very interesting.\n\n1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:09.800\n So I don't side with the people who say\n\n1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:10.840\n everything can be explained\n\n1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:13.320\n with sensor artifacts kind of thing.\n\n1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:14.280\n Yeah, I agree with you.\n\n1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:15.160\n I didn't say that either.\n\n1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:17.360\n I would say I just don't have enough data.\n\n1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:20.840\n But the thing I want to push back on is the statement\n\n1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:23.420\n that everybody has a high definition camera.\n\n1:15:23.420 --> 1:15:24.960\n One of the disappointing things to me\n\n1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:27.000\n about the report that the government released,\n\n1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.400\n but in general, just having worked with government,\n\n1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:32.840\n having worked with people all over\n\n1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:36.240\n is how incompetent we are.\n\n1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:38.800\n Like if you look at the response to the pandemic,\n\n1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:43.240\n how incompetent we are in the face of great challenges\n\n1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:46.080\n without great leadership.\n\n1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:47.900\n How incompetent we are in the face\n\n1:15:47.900 --> 1:15:51.680\n of the great mysteries before us without great leadership.\n\n1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:54.040\n And I just think it's actually,\n\n1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:56.000\n the fact that there's a lot of high definition cameras\n\n1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.000\n is not enough to capture the full richness of weird,\n\n1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:03.880\n of the mysterious phenomena out there\n\n1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:07.080\n of which extraterrestrial intelligence visiting Earth\n\n1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:08.080\n could be one.\n\n1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:09.400\n I don't think we have,\n\n1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:12.040\n I don't think everybody having a smartphone\n\n1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:14.880\n in their pocket is enough.\n\n1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:17.440\n I think that allows for TikTok videos.\n\n1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:19.920\n I don't think it allows for the capture\n\n1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.800\n of even interesting, relatively rare human events.\n\n1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:25.400\n That's not that common.\n\n1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:28.600\n It's rare to have been the right moment in the right time\n\n1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:30.600\n to be able to capture the thing.\n\n1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:31.520\n I agree, I agree.\n\n1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.960\n Let me rephrase what I think on this.\n\n1:16:33.960 --> 1:16:35.760\n I haven't seen enough information.\n\n1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:37.400\n I haven't really actively sorted out.\n\n1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:40.120\n I must admit, but I'm with you\n\n1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:42.560\n and I love the idea of anomaly detection\n\n1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:44.080\n in chemistry in particular, right?\n\n1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:45.800\n I want to make anomalies, sorry,\n\n1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.720\n or not necessarily make anomalies.\n\n1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:50.800\n I want to understand an anomaly.\n\n1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:52.560\n Let me give you two from chemistry,\n\n1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:55.640\n which are really quite interesting.\n\n1:16:56.680 --> 1:16:59.280\n Phlogiston, going way back,\n\n1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:02.080\n where people said there's this thing called phlogiston.\n\n1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:05.920\n And for ages, the alchemists got really this kind of,\n\n1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:07.920\n that fire is the thing.\n\n1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:09.960\n That's one.\n\n1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:11.200\n And then we determined that phlogiston\n\n1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:13.400\n wasn't what we thought it is.\n\n1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:15.280\n Let's go to physics, the ether.\n\n1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:16.440\n The ether's a hard one\n\n1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:18.480\n because I think actually the ether might exist.\n\n1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:20.920\n And I'll tell you what I think the ether is later.\n\n1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:25.080\n Can you explain the ether?\n\n1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:26.160\n So as the vacuum,\n\n1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:28.640\n so the light traveling through the ether in the vacuum,\n\n1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:30.720\n there is some thing that we call the ether\n\n1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:34.400\n that basically mediates the movement of light, say.\n\n1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:36.160\n And I think that...\n\n1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:38.240\n And then the other one is cold fusion,\n\n1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:39.080\n which is more of a...\n\n1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:40.340\n So a few years ago,\n\n1:17:40.340 --> 1:17:44.340\n people observed that when they did some electrochemistry,\n\n1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:48.260\n when they were splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen,\n\n1:17:48.260 --> 1:17:50.660\n that you got more energy out than you put in.\n\n1:17:50.660 --> 1:17:51.900\n And people got excited\n\n1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:54.700\n and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction.\n\n1:17:54.700 --> 1:17:57.980\n And in the end, it was kind of discredited\n\n1:17:57.980 --> 1:17:59.900\n because you didn't detect neutrons and all this stuff.\n\n1:17:59.900 --> 1:18:02.980\n But I'm pretty sure...\n\n1:18:02.980 --> 1:18:03.820\n I'm a chemist.\n\n1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:06.140\n I'm telling you this on your podcast, but why not?\n\n1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:07.380\n I'm pretty sure there's interesting\n\n1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:08.380\n electrochemical phenomena\n\n1:18:08.380 --> 1:18:09.900\n that's not completely bottomed out yet,\n\n1:18:09.900 --> 1:18:11.460\n that there is something there.\n\n1:18:11.460 --> 1:18:15.980\n However, we lack the technology and the experimental design.\n\n1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:18.260\n So all I'm saying in your response about aliens\n\n1:18:18.260 --> 1:18:20.420\n is we lack the experimental design\n\n1:18:20.420 --> 1:18:22.500\n to really capture these anomalies.\n\n1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:25.740\n And we are encircling the planet\n\n1:18:25.740 --> 1:18:27.360\n with many more detection systems.\n\n1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:28.980\n We've got satellites everywhere.\n\n1:18:28.980 --> 1:18:30.660\n So there is, I do hope\n\n1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:32.300\n that we are gonna discover more anomalies.\n\n1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:35.540\n And remember that the solar system\n\n1:18:35.540 --> 1:18:37.020\n isn't just static in space,\n\n1:18:37.020 --> 1:18:39.180\n it's moving through the universe.\n\n1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:40.740\n So there's just more and more chance.\n\n1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:42.740\n I'm not what with Avi Loeb.\n\n1:18:42.740 --> 1:18:46.780\n He's generating all sorts of kind of a cult,\n\n1:18:46.780 --> 1:18:50.500\n I would say, with this, but I'm not against him.\n\n1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:52.060\n I think there is a finite chance\n\n1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:53.180\n if there are aliens in the universe\n\n1:18:53.180 --> 1:18:54.780\n that we're gonna happen upon them\n\n1:18:54.780 --> 1:18:56.260\n because we're moving through the universe.\n\n1:18:56.260 --> 1:18:59.780\n What's the nature of the following that Avi Loeb has?\n\n1:18:59.780 --> 1:19:01.220\n He's doubling down more and more and more\n\n1:19:01.220 --> 1:19:02.220\n and say there are aliens,\n\n1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:04.460\n interdimensional aliens and everything else, right?\n\n1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:06.860\n He's gone from space junk accelerating out of\n\n1:19:06.860 --> 1:19:11.340\n to interdimensional stuff in a very short space of time.\n\n1:19:11.340 --> 1:19:12.180\n I see.\n\n1:19:12.180 --> 1:19:13.020\n He's obviously bored.\n\n1:19:15.020 --> 1:19:18.740\n Or he wants to tap into the psyche and understand.\n\n1:19:18.740 --> 1:19:21.140\n And he's playfully kind of trying to interact\n\n1:19:21.140 --> 1:19:22.880\n with society and his peers to say,\n\n1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:26.540\n stop saying it's not possible.\n\n1:19:26.540 --> 1:19:28.540\n Which I agree with, we shouldn't do that.\n\n1:19:28.540 --> 1:19:30.640\n But we should frame it statistically\n\n1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:32.800\n in the same way we should frame everything\n\n1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:34.920\n as good scientists, statistically.\n\n1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:39.920\n Yeah, good scientists.\n\n1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:43.560\n Recently, the idea of good scientists is,\n\n1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:47.760\n I take quite skeptically.\n\n1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:49.400\n I've been listening to a lot of scientists\n\n1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:52.680\n tell me about what is good science.\n\n1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:53.520\n That makes me sad.\n\n1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:54.440\n Because you've been interviewing\n\n1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:56.680\n what I would consider a lot of really good scientists.\n\n1:19:56.680 --> 1:19:57.520\n No, that's true.\n\n1:19:57.520 --> 1:19:58.340\n A lot of great thinkers.\n\n1:19:58.340 --> 1:19:59.960\n But that's exactly right.\n\n1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:01.360\n And most of the people I talk to\n\n1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:03.520\n are incredible human beings.\n\n1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:05.840\n But there's a humility that's required.\n\n1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:10.000\n Science is not, science cannot be dogmatism.\n\n1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:11.000\n Sure, I agree.\n\n1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:16.000\n I mean, authority, like a PhD does not give you authority.\n\n1:20:17.040 --> 1:20:19.520\n A lifelong pursuit of a particular task\n\n1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:21.000\n does not give you authority.\n\n1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:24.000\n You're just as lost in clues as everybody else.\n\n1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:27.280\n But you're more curious and more stubborn.\n\n1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:29.920\n So that's a nice quality to have.\n\n1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:34.920\n But overall, just using the word science and statistics\n\n1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:42.280\n can often, as you know, kind of become a catalyst\n\n1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:48.440\n for dismissing new ideas, out of the box ideas, wild ideas,\n\n1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:50.540\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:20:50.540 --> 1:20:52.200\n Well, yes and no.\n\n1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:55.560\n I think that, so I like to,\n\n1:20:57.520 --> 1:20:59.720\n some people find me extremely annoying in science\n\n1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:04.100\n because I'm basically, I'm quite rude and disruptive.\n\n1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:05.600\n Not in a rude, you know,\n\n1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:07.480\n some up to people and say they're ugly or stupid\n\n1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:08.320\n or anything like that.\n\n1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:12.240\n I just say, you know, you're wrong.\n\n1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:13.320\n Or why do you think this?\n\n1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:16.880\n And something, a gift I got given by society\n\n1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:17.720\n when I was very young,\n\n1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:20.640\n because I was in the learning difficulties class at school\n\n1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:22.760\n is I was told I was stupid.\n\n1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:24.880\n And so I know I'm stupid,\n\n1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:26.920\n but I always wanted to be smart, right?\n\n1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:29.040\n I remember going to school going,\n\n1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:30.560\n maybe today they're going to tell me\n\n1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:32.360\n I'm not as stupid as I was yesterday.\n\n1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:34.440\n And I was always disappointed, always.\n\n1:21:34.440 --> 1:21:36.640\n And so when I went into academia and everyone says,\n\n1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:39.140\n you're wrong, I was like, join the queue.\n\n1:21:39.140 --> 1:21:40.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:43.460\n Because it allowed me to walk through the wall.\n\n1:21:43.460 --> 1:21:46.200\n So I think that people like to always imagine science\n\n1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:48.120\n as a bit like living in a Japanese house,\n\n1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:52.000\n the paper walls, and everyone sits in their room.\n\n1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.320\n And I annoy people because I walk straight through the wall.\n\n1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:56.720\n Not because, why should I be a chemist\n\n1:21:56.720 --> 1:21:58.040\n and not a mathematician?\n\n1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:00.440\n Why should I be a mathematician and not a computer scientist?\n\n1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:02.320\n Because if the problem requires us\n\n1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:05.040\n to walk through those walls,\n\n1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:08.400\n but I like walking through the walls.\n\n1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:11.160\n But as long, then I have to put up,\n\n1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:12.440\n you know, I have to do good science.\n\n1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:15.440\n I have to win the people in those rooms\n\n1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:17.240\n across by good science,\n\n1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:21.000\n by taking their criticisms and addressing them head on.\n\n1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.440\n And I think we must do that.\n\n1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:25.240\n And I think that I try and do that in my own way.\n\n1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:28.120\n And I kind of love walking through the walls.\n\n1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:33.200\n And it gives me, it's difficult for me personally.\n\n1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:35.100\n It's quite painful,\n\n1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:38.280\n but it always leads to a deeper understanding\n\n1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:39.360\n of the people I'm with.\n\n1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:41.040\n In particular, you know, the arguments I have\n\n1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:43.400\n with all sorts of interesting minds,\n\n1:22:43.400 --> 1:22:45.840\n because I want to solve the problem,\n\n1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:48.380\n or I want to understand more about why I exist.\n\n1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:52.660\n You know, that's it really.\n\n1:22:52.660 --> 1:22:55.120\n And I think we have to not dismiss science\n\n1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:55.960\n on that basis.\n\n1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:58.240\n I think we can work with science.\n\n1:22:58.240 --> 1:22:59.420\n No, science is beautiful,\n\n1:22:59.420 --> 1:23:03.160\n but humans with egos and all those kinds of things\n\n1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:08.160\n can sometimes misuse good things,\n\n1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:10.680\n like social justice,\n\n1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:14.200\n like all ideas we're all aspire to misuse\n\n1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:18.680\n these beautiful ideas to manipulate people,\n\n1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:20.080\n to all those kinds of things.\n\n1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:20.920\n Sure.\n\n1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:24.600\n And that's, there's assholes in every space\n\n1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:26.600\n and walk of life, including science.\n\n1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:27.440\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.\n\n1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:28.800\n And those are no good.\n\n1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:29.800\n But yes, you're right.\n\n1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:34.600\n The scientific method has proven to be quite useful.\n\n1:23:34.600 --> 1:23:36.520\n That said, for difficult questions,\n\n1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:41.520\n for difficult explanations for rare phenomena,\n\n1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.780\n you have to walk cautiously.\n\n1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:50.200\n Because the scientific method,\n\n1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:53.200\n when you totally don't understand something,\n\n1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:55.440\n and it's rare, and you can't replicate it,\n\n1:23:55.440 --> 1:23:57.080\n doesn't quite apply.\n\n1:23:57.080 --> 1:23:58.420\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.\n\n1:23:58.420 --> 1:23:59.260\n I agree with you.\n\n1:23:59.260 --> 1:24:02.080\n The challenge is to not dismiss the anomaly\n\n1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:03.520\n because you can't replicate it.\n\n1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:05.220\n I mean, we can talk about this.\n\n1:24:05.220 --> 1:24:06.480\n This is something I realized\n\n1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:08.520\n when we were developing assembly theory.\n\n1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:13.920\n People thinking that the track they're on\n\n1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:18.000\n is so dogmatic, but there is this thing that they see,\n\n1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.040\n but they don't see.\n\n1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:20.240\n And it takes a bit of time\n\n1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:21.740\n and you just have to keep reframing it.\n\n1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:25.040\n And my approach is to say, well, why can't this be right?\n\n1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:29.480\n Why must we accept that RNA is the only way into life?\n\n1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:30.480\n I mean, who said?\n\n1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:35.480\n Does RNA have a special class of information\n\n1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:37.160\n that's encoded in the universe?\n\n1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:38.600\n No, of course it doesn't, right?\n\n1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:41.080\n RNA is not a special molecule\n\n1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:42.840\n in the space of all the other molecules.\n\n1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:44.520\n But it's so elegant and simple\n\n1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:46.680\n and it works so well for the evolutionary process\n\n1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:48.600\n that we kind of use that as an intuition\n\n1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:51.440\n to explain that that must be the only way to have life.\n\n1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:52.280\n Sure.\n\n1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:55.160\n But you mentioned assembly theory.\n\n1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:57.680\n Well, first let me pause, bathroom break, needed?\n\n1:24:57.680 --> 1:24:59.880\n Yeah, let's take two minutes.\n\n1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:02.480\n We took a quick break and offline,\n\n1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:07.380\n you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home.\n\n1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:10.640\n And then I said that you're basically Rick\n\n1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:11.560\n from Rick and Morty,\n\n1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:13.640\n which is something I've been thinking\n\n1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:15.200\n this whole conversation.\n\n1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:19.080\n And then you say that there's a glowing pickle\n\n1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:23.540\n that you used something involving cold plasma, I believe.\n\n1:25:23.540 --> 1:25:24.860\n I don't know, but can you explain\n\n1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:26.280\n the glowing pickle situation?\n\n1:25:31.420 --> 1:25:34.380\n And is there many, arbitrarily many versions of you\n\n1:25:34.380 --> 1:25:37.380\n in alternate dimensions that you're aware of?\n\n1:25:37.380 --> 1:25:41.500\n I tried to make an electrochemical memory at home\n\n1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:45.580\n using a pickle and the only way I could get\n\n1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:49.140\n any traction with it was actually by plugging it\n\n1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:51.620\n into a very high voltage alternating current\n\n1:25:51.620 --> 1:25:53.840\n and then putting in a couple of electrodes.\n\n1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:54.980\n But my kids weren't impressed.\n\n1:25:54.980 --> 1:25:56.580\n They're not impressed with anything I do,\n\n1:25:56.580 --> 1:25:57.880\n any experiments I do at home.\n\n1:25:57.880 --> 1:25:58.900\n I think it's quite funny.\n\n1:25:58.900 --> 1:26:01.300\n But you connected a pickle to some electrode.\n\n1:26:01.300 --> 1:26:03.460\n 240 volts, yeah, AC.\n\n1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:04.860\n And then had a couple of electrodes on it.\n\n1:26:04.860 --> 1:26:06.260\n So what happens is a pickle,\n\n1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:09.820\n this is a classic thing you do.\n\n1:26:09.820 --> 1:26:11.500\n I mean, I shouldn't, pranks you do,\n\n1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:13.180\n you put a pickle into the mains\n\n1:26:13.180 --> 1:26:15.180\n and just leave it, run away and leave it.\n\n1:26:15.180 --> 1:26:17.620\n And what happens is it starts to decompose.\n\n1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:19.060\n It heats up and then explodes\n\n1:26:19.060 --> 1:26:20.980\n because the water turns to steam\n\n1:26:20.980 --> 1:26:22.740\n and it just violently explodes.\n\n1:26:22.740 --> 1:26:25.300\n But I wondered if I could cause the iron,\n\n1:26:25.300 --> 1:26:27.420\n sodium, potassium ions in the pickle to migrate.\n\n1:26:27.420 --> 1:26:28.740\n It'd been in a jar, right?\n\n1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:31.120\n So it'd been in a brine.\n\n1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:34.340\n That was, yeah, that was not my best experiment.\n\n1:26:34.340 --> 1:26:36.940\n So I've done far better experiments in my lab at home.\n\n1:26:36.940 --> 1:26:38.500\n At that time it was a failed experiment,\n\n1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:40.180\n but you never know, it could,\n\n1:26:41.580 --> 1:26:44.580\n every experiment is a successful experiment\n\n1:26:44.580 --> 1:26:46.020\n if you stick with it long enough.\n\n1:26:46.020 --> 1:26:48.260\n Well, I mean, I get, I got kicked out of my own lab\n\n1:26:48.260 --> 1:26:50.840\n by my research team many years ago and for good reason.\n\n1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:51.900\n I mean, my team is brilliant\n\n1:26:51.900 --> 1:26:53.820\n and I used to go and just break things.\n\n1:26:53.820 --> 1:26:55.420\n So what I do do at home\n\n1:26:55.420 --> 1:26:57.580\n is I have a kind of electronics workshop\n\n1:26:58.780 --> 1:27:01.380\n and I prototype experiments there.\n\n1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:05.260\n Then I try and then I try and suggest to my team sometimes,\n\n1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:07.180\n maybe we can try this thing.\n\n1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:08.460\n And they would just say, oh,\n\n1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:10.140\n wow, that's not gonna work because of this.\n\n1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:12.020\n And I'll say, aha, but actually I've tried\n\n1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:14.100\n and here's some code and here's some hardware.\n\n1:27:14.100 --> 1:27:15.220\n Can we have a go?\n\n1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:17.460\n So I'm doing that less and less now\n\n1:27:17.460 --> 1:27:20.740\n as I get even more busy, but that's quite fun\n\n1:27:20.740 --> 1:27:24.180\n because they feel that we're in the experiment together.\n\n1:27:24.180 --> 1:27:28.540\n You do, in fact, brilliantly, just like Rick\n\n1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:33.540\n from Rick and Morty, connect up chemistry with computation.\n\n1:27:38.860 --> 1:27:40.140\n And when we say chemistry,\n\n1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:45.140\n we don't mean the simulation of chemistry,\n\n1:27:45.420 --> 1:27:46.940\n a modeling of chemistry.\n\n1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:49.260\n We mean chemistry in the physical space\n\n1:27:49.260 --> 1:27:52.180\n as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating.\n\n1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:54.260\n We'll talk about that.\n\n1:27:54.260 --> 1:27:56.020\n But first you mentioned assembly theory.\n\n1:27:56.020 --> 1:28:00.780\n So we'll stick on theory in these big ideas.\n\n1:28:00.780 --> 1:28:03.020\n I would say revolutionary ideas,\n\n1:28:03.020 --> 1:28:07.280\n this intersection between mathematics and philosophy.\n\n1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:09.140\n What is assembly theory?\n\n1:28:09.140 --> 1:28:13.660\n And generally speaking, how would we recognize life\n\n1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:15.300\n if we saw it?\n\n1:28:15.300 --> 1:28:17.620\n So assembly theory is a theory,\n\n1:28:17.620 --> 1:28:19.580\n goes back a few years now in my struggle\n\n1:28:19.580 --> 1:28:22.100\n for maybe almost 10 years\n\n1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:24.380\n when I was going to origin of life conferences\n\n1:28:24.380 --> 1:28:25.780\n and artificial life conferences,\n\n1:28:25.780 --> 1:28:28.260\n where I thought that everybody was dancing\n\n1:28:28.260 --> 1:28:32.700\n around the problem of what life is and what it does.\n\n1:28:32.700 --> 1:28:34.420\n But I'll tell you about what assembly theory is\n\n1:28:34.420 --> 1:28:35.820\n because I think it's easier.\n\n1:28:35.820 --> 1:28:39.220\n So assembly theory literally says if you take an object,\n\n1:28:39.220 --> 1:28:40.940\n any given object,\n\n1:28:40.940 --> 1:28:43.860\n and you are able to break the object into parts very gently.\n\n1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:46.380\n So just maybe let's say take a piece\n\n1:28:46.380 --> 1:28:48.980\n of very intricate Chinese porcelain\n\n1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:52.220\n and you tap it just with a hammer or the nail at some point,\n\n1:28:52.220 --> 1:28:54.940\n and it will fragment into many parts.\n\n1:28:54.940 --> 1:28:57.860\n And if that object is able to fragment into many,\n\n1:28:57.860 --> 1:29:00.500\n and you count those parts, the different parts,\n\n1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:02.540\n so they're unsymmetrical,\n\n1:29:02.540 --> 1:29:07.180\n assembly theory says the larger the number of parts,\n\n1:29:07.180 --> 1:29:10.140\n unsymmetrical parts that object has,\n\n1:29:10.140 --> 1:29:12.500\n the more likely it is that object has been created\n\n1:29:12.500 --> 1:29:15.020\n by an evolutionary or information process,\n\n1:29:15.020 --> 1:29:18.940\n especially if that object is not one off,\n\n1:29:18.940 --> 1:29:22.100\n you've got an abundance of them.\n\n1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:23.220\n And that's really important.\n\n1:29:23.220 --> 1:29:26.860\n So because what I'm literally saying about the abundance,\n\n1:29:26.860 --> 1:29:30.260\n if you have a one off object and you break it into parts\n\n1:29:30.260 --> 1:29:32.180\n and it has lots of parts,\n\n1:29:32.180 --> 1:29:36.380\n you'd say, well, that could be incredibly intricate\n\n1:29:36.380 --> 1:29:39.940\n and complex, but it could be just random.\n\n1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:41.740\n And I was troubled with this for years\n\n1:29:41.740 --> 1:29:44.700\n because I saw in reality that assembly theory works.\n\n1:29:44.700 --> 1:29:46.180\n But when I talked to very good\n\n1:29:46.180 --> 1:29:49.700\n computational complexity computation lists,\n\n1:29:49.700 --> 1:29:51.340\n algorithmic complexity people,\n\n1:29:51.340 --> 1:29:53.820\n they said, you haven't really done this properly.\n\n1:29:53.820 --> 1:29:54.780\n You haven't thought about it.\n\n1:29:54.780 --> 1:29:57.660\n It's like, this is the random problem.\n\n1:29:57.660 --> 1:29:59.980\n And so I kept working this up\n\n1:29:59.980 --> 1:30:03.100\n because I invented an assembly theory in chemistry,\n\n1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:05.060\n first of all, with molecules.\n\n1:30:05.060 --> 1:30:06.780\n And so the thought experiment was,\n\n1:30:08.060 --> 1:30:11.460\n how complex does a molecule need to be when I find it\n\n1:30:11.460 --> 1:30:13.460\n that it couldn't possibly have risen by chance,\n\n1:30:13.460 --> 1:30:15.180\n probabilistically.\n\n1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:16.500\n And if I found this molecule,\n\n1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:18.940\n able to detect it enough quantities in the same object,\n\n1:30:18.940 --> 1:30:20.780\n like a machine, like a mass spectrometer.\n\n1:30:20.780 --> 1:30:22.100\n So typically in a mass spectrometer,\n\n1:30:22.100 --> 1:30:24.300\n you weigh the molecules in electric field.\n\n1:30:24.300 --> 1:30:26.300\n You probably have to have all the order of 10,000\n\n1:30:26.300 --> 1:30:28.460\n identical molecules to get a signal.\n\n1:30:28.460 --> 1:30:32.820\n So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex.\n\n1:30:32.820 --> 1:30:36.660\n What is the chance of them occurring by chance?\n\n1:30:36.660 --> 1:30:37.500\n Well, we can do the math.\n\n1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:39.220\n Let's take a molecule like strychnine\n\n1:30:39.220 --> 1:30:44.220\n or, yeah, so strychnine is a good molecule actually to take\n\n1:30:44.980 --> 1:30:46.780\n or Viagra is a good molecule.\n\n1:30:46.780 --> 1:30:49.540\n I made jokes about Viagra because it's a complex molecule.\n\n1:30:49.540 --> 1:30:50.620\n And one of my friends said, yeah,\n\n1:30:50.620 --> 1:30:53.300\n if we find Viagra on Mars in detectable quantities,\n\n1:30:53.300 --> 1:30:54.620\n we know something is up.\n\n1:30:54.620 --> 1:30:59.620\n And yeah, but anyway, it's a complex molecule.\n\n1:31:00.220 --> 1:31:01.660\n So what you do is you take this molecule\n\n1:31:01.660 --> 1:31:03.780\n in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons\n\n1:31:03.780 --> 1:31:06.220\n or in electric field and it breaks apart.\n\n1:31:06.220 --> 1:31:09.940\n And if the larger the number of different parts,\n\n1:31:09.940 --> 1:31:12.780\n you know when it starts to get refreshed,\n\n1:31:12.780 --> 1:31:15.020\n my idea was that that molecule could not be created\n\n1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:17.180\n by chance, probabilistically.\n\n1:31:17.180 --> 1:31:20.260\n So that was where assembly theory was born\n\n1:31:20.260 --> 1:31:22.780\n in an experiment, in a mass spec experiment.\n\n1:31:22.780 --> 1:31:24.340\n And I was thinking about this\n\n1:31:24.340 --> 1:31:26.940\n because NASA is sending mass spectrometers to Mars,\n\n1:31:26.940 --> 1:31:29.620\n to Titan, it's gonna send them to Europa.\n\n1:31:29.620 --> 1:31:32.020\n There's gonna be a nuclear powered mass spectrometer\n\n1:31:32.020 --> 1:31:33.620\n going to Titan.\n\n1:31:33.620 --> 1:31:35.900\n I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever.\n\n1:31:35.900 --> 1:31:37.260\n They're not only sending a drone\n\n1:31:37.260 --> 1:31:38.460\n that's gonna fly around Titan,\n\n1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:43.460\n it's gonna be powered by a nuclear slug, a nuclear battery,\n\n1:31:43.820 --> 1:31:45.940\n and it's gonna have a mass spectrometer on it.\n\n1:31:45.940 --> 1:31:47.180\n Is this already launched?\n\n1:31:47.180 --> 1:31:49.300\n No, it's Dragonfly\n\n1:31:49.300 --> 1:31:50.900\n and it's gonna be launched in a few years.\n\n1:31:50.900 --> 1:31:53.460\n I think it got pushed a year because of the pandemic.\n\n1:31:53.460 --> 1:31:55.180\n So I think it's three or four years.\n\n1:31:55.180 --> 1:31:59.300\n Dragonfly, nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly to Titan\n\n1:32:00.900 --> 1:32:05.900\n and collect data about the composition\n\n1:32:07.420 --> 1:32:09.580\n of the various chemicals on Titan.\n\n1:32:09.580 --> 1:32:11.340\n Yeah, I'm trying to convince NASA.\n\n1:32:11.340 --> 1:32:12.620\n I don't know if I'll be able to convince\n\n1:32:12.620 --> 1:32:16.980\n the Dragonfly team that they should apply this approach,\n\n1:32:16.980 --> 1:32:18.020\n but they will get data.\n\n1:32:18.020 --> 1:32:20.820\n And depending on how good their mass spectrometer is.\n\n1:32:20.820 --> 1:32:22.340\n But I had this thought experiment anyway,\n\n1:32:22.340 --> 1:32:24.340\n and I did this thought experiment.\n\n1:32:24.340 --> 1:32:26.620\n And for me, it seemed to work.\n\n1:32:26.620 --> 1:32:29.060\n I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm\n\n1:32:29.060 --> 1:32:30.060\n in assembly theory.\n\n1:32:30.060 --> 1:32:32.500\n And I basically, assembly theory, if I take,\n\n1:32:32.500 --> 1:32:33.740\n let's just make it generic.\n\n1:32:33.740 --> 1:32:36.220\n And so let's just take the word abracadabra.\n\n1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:38.940\n Say, can I, if you find the word,\n\n1:32:38.940 --> 1:32:41.140\n so if you have a book with lots of words in it\n\n1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:42.780\n and you find abracadabra one off,\n\n1:32:42.780 --> 1:32:45.500\n and it's a rap book that's been written by,\n\n1:32:45.500 --> 1:32:48.460\n in a random way, set of monkeys in a room.\n\n1:32:48.460 --> 1:32:50.500\n And you're on typewriters.\n\n1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:51.900\n And you find one off abracadabra,\n\n1:32:51.900 --> 1:32:52.740\n no big deal.\n\n1:32:52.740 --> 1:32:55.900\n But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra,\n\n1:32:55.900 --> 1:32:57.500\n well, that means something weird is going on.\n\n1:32:57.500 --> 1:33:00.460\n But let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra.\n\n1:33:00.460 --> 1:33:04.820\n So abracadabra has a number of letters in it.\n\n1:33:04.820 --> 1:33:05.700\n You can break it down.\n\n1:33:05.700 --> 1:33:07.540\n So you just cut the letters up.\n\n1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:09.660\n But when you actually reassemble abracadabra,\n\n1:33:09.660 --> 1:33:12.460\n the minimum number of ways of organizing those letters.\n\n1:33:12.460 --> 1:33:16.540\n So you'd have an A, a B, and keep going up.\n\n1:33:18.860 --> 1:33:21.540\n When you cut abracadabra up into parts,\n\n1:33:21.540 --> 1:33:24.060\n you can put it together again in seven steps.\n\n1:33:24.060 --> 1:33:24.900\n So what does that mean?\n\n1:33:24.900 --> 1:33:26.980\n That means if you basically don't,\n\n1:33:26.980 --> 1:33:28.540\n you're allowed to reuse things\n\n1:33:28.540 --> 1:33:30.540\n you make in a chain at the beginning.\n\n1:33:30.540 --> 1:33:32.500\n That's the memory of the universe,\n\n1:33:32.500 --> 1:33:35.020\n the process that makes abracadabra.\n\n1:33:35.020 --> 1:33:36.460\n And because of that causal chain,\n\n1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:38.500\n you can then get to abracadabra\n\n1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:40.460\n quicker than the number of letters\n\n1:33:40.460 --> 1:33:43.180\n for having to specify only in seven.\n\n1:33:43.180 --> 1:33:44.620\n So if you take that to a molecule\n\n1:33:44.620 --> 1:33:47.900\n and you cut the molecule up into parts,\n\n1:33:47.900 --> 1:33:49.820\n and you can, on the causal chain,\n\n1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:51.460\n and you basically start with the atoms\n\n1:33:51.460 --> 1:33:54.500\n and then bonds, and then you randomly add on those parts\n\n1:33:54.500 --> 1:33:58.700\n to make the A, make the B, and keep going all the way up,\n\n1:33:59.700 --> 1:34:01.580\n I found that literally, assembly theory\n\n1:34:01.580 --> 1:34:04.900\n allows me to say how compressed a molecule is.\n\n1:34:04.900 --> 1:34:07.820\n So when there's some information in there.\n\n1:34:07.820 --> 1:34:09.620\n And I realized assembly theory\n\n1:34:09.620 --> 1:34:13.260\n isn't just confined to molecular space.\n\n1:34:13.260 --> 1:34:14.140\n It can apply to anything.\n\n1:34:14.140 --> 1:34:16.020\n But let me finish the molecular argument.\n\n1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:18.660\n So what I did is I had this theory.\n\n1:34:18.660 --> 1:34:22.660\n I, with one of my students, we wrote an algorithm.\n\n1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:26.300\n We basically took the 20 million molecules from a database\n\n1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:28.740\n and we just calculate their assembly number.\n\n1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:29.580\n And that's the index.\n\n1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:32.020\n Like basically, if I take a molecule\n\n1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:33.900\n and I cut it up into bonds,\n\n1:34:33.900 --> 1:34:36.620\n what is the minimum number of steps I need to take\n\n1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:39.700\n to reform that molecule from atoms?\n\n1:34:39.700 --> 1:34:42.580\n So reusability of previously formed things\n\n1:34:42.580 --> 1:34:43.900\n is somehow a fundamental part of what it is.\n\n1:34:43.900 --> 1:34:46.380\n Exactly, it's like a memory in the universe, right?\n\n1:34:46.380 --> 1:34:47.740\n I'm making lots of leaps here.\n\n1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:48.820\n Like, it's kind of weird.\n\n1:34:48.820 --> 1:34:50.060\n I'm saying, right, there's a process\n\n1:34:50.060 --> 1:34:53.380\n that can form the A and the B and the C, let's say.\n\n1:34:53.380 --> 1:34:56.300\n And then because we've formed A and B before,\n\n1:34:56.300 --> 1:35:00.060\n we can use A and B again with no extra cost except one unit.\n\n1:35:00.060 --> 1:35:02.540\n So that's the kind of what the chain of events.\n\n1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:04.260\n And that's how you think about memory here\n\n1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:05.940\n when you say the universe,\n\n1:35:05.940 --> 1:35:07.540\n when you talk about the universe\n\n1:35:07.540 --> 1:35:11.860\n or life is the universe creating memory.\n\n1:35:11.860 --> 1:35:12.860\n Exactly.\n\n1:35:12.860 --> 1:35:15.220\n So we went through chemical space\n\n1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:16.940\n and we looked at the assembly numbers.\n\n1:35:16.940 --> 1:35:18.620\n We were able to classify it.\n\n1:35:18.620 --> 1:35:20.500\n So, okay, let's test it.\n\n1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:21.580\n Let's go.\n\n1:35:21.580 --> 1:35:23.980\n So we're able to take a whole bunch of molecules\n\n1:35:23.980 --> 1:35:27.500\n and assign an assembly index to them, okay?\n\n1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:30.740\n And it's just a function of the number of bonds\n\n1:35:30.740 --> 1:35:32.380\n in the molecule and how much symmetry.\n\n1:35:32.380 --> 1:35:34.820\n So literally assembly theory is a measure\n\n1:35:34.820 --> 1:35:37.940\n of how little symmetry a molecule has.\n\n1:35:37.940 --> 1:35:40.580\n And so the more asymmetry, the more information,\n\n1:35:40.580 --> 1:35:41.420\n the more weird it is,\n\n1:35:41.420 --> 1:35:44.420\n like a Jackson Pollock of some description.\n\n1:35:44.420 --> 1:35:47.740\n So I then went and did a load of experiments.\n\n1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:49.980\n And I basically took those molecules,\n\n1:35:49.980 --> 1:35:51.340\n I cut them up in the mass spec\n\n1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:52.660\n and measured the number of peaks\n\n1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:55.180\n without any knowledge of the molecule.\n\n1:35:55.180 --> 1:35:57.220\n And we found the assembly number,\n\n1:35:57.220 --> 1:36:00.620\n there was almost not quite a one to one correlation,\n\n1:36:00.620 --> 1:36:02.740\n but almost because not all bonds are equal.\n\n1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:03.940\n They have different energies.\n\n1:36:03.940 --> 1:36:07.020\n I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques,\n\n1:36:07.020 --> 1:36:08.700\n NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance,\n\n1:36:08.700 --> 1:36:11.700\n which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules\n\n1:36:11.700 --> 1:36:13.100\n and get a signature out.\n\n1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:15.060\n And I also used infrared.\n\n1:36:15.060 --> 1:36:18.180\n And infrared and NMR almost gave us a one to one correlation.\n\n1:36:18.180 --> 1:36:19.540\n So what am I saying?\n\n1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:21.780\n Saying by taking a molecule\n\n1:36:21.780 --> 1:36:26.020\n and doing either infrared or NMR or mass spec,\n\n1:36:26.020 --> 1:36:30.060\n I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule\n\n1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:32.300\n and then put it on a scale.\n\n1:36:32.300 --> 1:36:35.580\n And what we did in the next part of the work\n\n1:36:35.580 --> 1:36:39.140\n is we took molecules randomly from the environment,\n\n1:36:39.140 --> 1:36:41.380\n from outer space, from all around earth,\n\n1:36:41.380 --> 1:36:45.660\n from the sea, from Antarctica,\n\n1:36:45.660 --> 1:36:47.500\n and from fossils and so on.\n\n1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:49.700\n And even NASA, because they didn't believe us,\n\n1:36:49.700 --> 1:36:51.540\n blinded some samples.\n\n1:36:51.540 --> 1:36:56.540\n And we found that all these samples that came from biology\n\n1:36:57.380 --> 1:37:00.500\n produced molecules that had a very high assembly number\n\n1:37:00.500 --> 1:37:02.820\n above a threshold of about 15.\n\n1:37:02.820 --> 1:37:05.820\n So basically all the stuff that came\n\n1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:08.620\n from an ebiotic origin was low.\n\n1:37:08.620 --> 1:37:10.180\n There was no complexity there.\n\n1:37:10.180 --> 1:37:12.620\n So we suddenly realized that on earth at least,\n\n1:37:12.620 --> 1:37:16.140\n there is a cutoff that natural phenomena\n\n1:37:16.140 --> 1:37:17.620\n cannot produce molecules\n\n1:37:17.620 --> 1:37:20.020\n that need more than 15 steps to make them.\n\n1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:25.260\n So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of life,\n\n1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:27.380\n a scale of technology as well.\n\n1:37:27.380 --> 1:37:30.460\n And literally you could just go sniffing for molecules\n\n1:37:30.460 --> 1:37:33.340\n off earth, on Titan, on Mars.\n\n1:37:33.340 --> 1:37:35.660\n And when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer\n\n1:37:35.660 --> 1:37:37.740\n that gives you more than 15 parts,\n\n1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:40.660\n you'll know pretty much for sure\n\n1:37:40.660 --> 1:37:43.220\n that it had to be produced by evolution.\n\n1:37:43.220 --> 1:37:45.380\n And this allowed me to come up with a general definition\n\n1:37:45.380 --> 1:37:47.340\n of life based on assembly theory,\n\n1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:51.380\n to say that if I find an object that has a large number\n\n1:37:51.380 --> 1:37:54.700\n of parts, say an iPhone or Boeing 747,\n\n1:37:54.700 --> 1:37:58.740\n or any complex object and I can find it in abundance\n\n1:37:58.740 --> 1:38:03.060\n and cut it up, I can tell you whether that has been produced\n\n1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:04.980\n by an informational process or not.\n\n1:38:04.980 --> 1:38:07.700\n And that's what assembly theory kind of does.\n\n1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:08.940\n But it goes a bit further.\n\n1:38:09.820 --> 1:38:12.260\n I then realized that this isn't just about life,\n\n1:38:12.260 --> 1:38:14.300\n it's about causation.\n\n1:38:14.300 --> 1:38:15.860\n So actually it tells you about\n\n1:38:15.860 --> 1:38:17.380\n whether it's a causal structure.\n\n1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:19.020\n So now I can look at objects in the universe,\n\n1:38:19.020 --> 1:38:20.780\n say that again, this cup and say, right,\n\n1:38:20.780 --> 1:38:23.740\n I'm gonna look at how many independent parts it has.\n\n1:38:23.740 --> 1:38:25.540\n So that's the assembly number.\n\n1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:28.020\n I'll then look at the abundance, how many cups?\n\n1:38:28.020 --> 1:38:28.940\n There are two on this table,\n\n1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:31.140\n maybe there's a few more you got stashed away.\n\n1:38:31.140 --> 1:38:36.140\n So assembly is a function of the complexity of the object\n\n1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:39.380\n times the number of copy numbers of that object\n\n1:38:39.380 --> 1:38:41.900\n or a function of the copy number normalized.\n\n1:38:41.900 --> 1:38:45.100\n So I realized there's a new quantity in the universe.\n\n1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:48.140\n You have energy, entropy, and assembly.\n\n1:38:49.140 --> 1:38:51.220\n So assembly, the way we should think about that\n\n1:38:51.220 --> 1:38:55.220\n is how much reusability there is.\n\n1:38:55.220 --> 1:38:57.860\n Because reusability is like,\n\n1:38:57.860 --> 1:38:59.700\n can you play devil's advocate to this?\n\n1:38:59.700 --> 1:39:04.700\n So could this just be a nice tertiary signal\n\n1:39:08.060 --> 1:39:10.340\n for living organisms?\n\n1:39:10.340 --> 1:39:13.420\n Like some kind of distant signal that's,\n\n1:39:13.420 --> 1:39:15.140\n yeah, this is a nice property,\n\n1:39:15.140 --> 1:39:17.740\n but it's not capturing something fundamental.\n\n1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:20.260\n Or do you think reusability is something fundamental\n\n1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:22.580\n to life and complex organisms?\n\n1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:25.620\n I think reusability is fundamental in the universe,\n\n1:39:25.620 --> 1:39:27.660\n not just for life and complex organisms.\n\n1:39:27.660 --> 1:39:29.420\n It's about causation.\n\n1:39:29.420 --> 1:39:32.860\n So I think assembly tells you if you find objects,\n\n1:39:32.860 --> 1:39:35.300\n cause you can do this with trajectories as well.\n\n1:39:35.300 --> 1:39:36.380\n You think about it,\n\n1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:41.380\n that the fact there are objects in the universe on earth\n\n1:39:41.820 --> 1:39:42.700\n is weird.\n\n1:39:43.820 --> 1:39:44.660\n You think about it,\n\n1:39:44.660 --> 1:39:47.500\n we should just have a combinatorial explosion of stuff.\n\n1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:52.500\n The fact that not everything exists is really weird.\n\n1:39:53.620 --> 1:39:54.460\n Now then.\n\n1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:59.100\n And then as I'm looking at two mugs and two water bottles\n\n1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:04.100\n and the things that exist kind of are similar\n\n1:40:04.660 --> 1:40:08.100\n and multiply in copies of each other.\n\n1:40:08.100 --> 1:40:10.780\n So I would say that assembly allows you to do something\n\n1:40:10.780 --> 1:40:14.220\n that statistical mechanics and people looking at entropy\n\n1:40:14.220 --> 1:40:16.940\n have got stuck with for a while.\n\n1:40:16.940 --> 1:40:18.420\n So I'm making, it's pretty bold.\n\n1:40:18.420 --> 1:40:20.380\n I mean, I'm writing a paper with Sarah Walker\n\n1:40:20.380 --> 1:40:21.940\n on this at the moment.\n\n1:40:21.940 --> 1:40:23.260\n And we're realizing,\n\n1:40:23.260 --> 1:40:24.340\n we don't want to get ahead of ourselves\n\n1:40:24.340 --> 1:40:27.580\n because I think that there's lots of ways where this is,\n\n1:40:27.580 --> 1:40:30.500\n you know, it's a really interesting idea.\n\n1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:33.420\n It works for molecules and it appears to work\n\n1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:35.540\n for any objects produced by causation.\n\n1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:36.420\n Cause you can take a motor car,\n\n1:40:36.420 --> 1:40:37.620\n you can look at the assembly of the motor car,\n\n1:40:37.620 --> 1:40:39.740\n look at a book, look at the assembly of the book.\n\n1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:41.100\n Assembly theory tells you\n\n1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:43.940\n there's a way of compressing and reusing.\n\n1:40:43.940 --> 1:40:46.740\n And so when people, I talk to information theorists,\n\n1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:48.780\n they say, oh, this is just logical depth.\n\n1:40:48.780 --> 1:40:51.300\n I say, it is like logical depth,\n\n1:40:51.300 --> 1:40:53.940\n but it's experimentally measurable.\n\n1:40:53.940 --> 1:40:55.700\n They say, oh, it's a bit like Komogolov complexity.\n\n1:40:55.700 --> 1:40:57.780\n And so, but it's computable.\n\n1:40:59.020 --> 1:41:00.540\n And now, okay, it's not infinitely computable,\n\n1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:02.300\n gets MP hard very quickly, right?\n\n1:41:02.300 --> 1:41:04.140\n It's very hard problem when you could get,\n\n1:41:04.140 --> 1:41:06.220\n but it's a computable enough,\n\n1:41:06.220 --> 1:41:08.180\n you could tractable enough to be able to tell\n\n1:41:08.180 --> 1:41:09.220\n the difference between a molecule\n\n1:41:09.220 --> 1:41:11.100\n that's been formed by the random background\n\n1:41:11.100 --> 1:41:13.580\n and by causation.\n\n1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:16.540\n And I think that that's really interesting\n\n1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:19.060\n because until now there's no way\n\n1:41:19.060 --> 1:41:21.020\n of measuring complexity objectively.\n\n1:41:21.020 --> 1:41:26.020\n Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons\n\n1:41:26.220 --> 1:41:30.500\n and programs and human beings to label things.\n\n1:41:30.500 --> 1:41:32.620\n Assembly is label free.\n\n1:41:32.620 --> 1:41:34.180\n Well, not entirely.\n\n1:41:34.180 --> 1:41:37.020\n We can talk about what that means in a minute.\n\n1:41:37.020 --> 1:41:42.020\n Okay, my brain has been broken a couple of times here.\n\n1:41:42.020 --> 1:41:43.460\n I'm sorry I explained it really badly.\n\n1:41:43.460 --> 1:41:45.020\n No, it was very well explained.\n\n1:41:45.020 --> 1:41:45.940\n It was just fascinating.\n\n1:41:45.940 --> 1:41:50.380\n And it's, my brain is broken into pieces\n\n1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:51.780\n and I'm trying to assemble it.\n\n1:41:53.180 --> 1:41:55.500\n So MP hard.\n\n1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:58.300\n So when you have a molecule,\n\n1:41:58.300 --> 1:42:01.020\n you're trying to figure out, okay,\n\n1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:03.780\n if we were to reuse parts of this molecule,\n\n1:42:03.780 --> 1:42:08.780\n which parts can we reuse as an optimization problem,\n\n1:42:10.140 --> 1:42:13.500\n and be hard to figure out the minimum amount\n\n1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:18.140\n of reused components that will create this molecule.\n\n1:42:18.140 --> 1:42:19.660\n And it becomes difficult when you start\n\n1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:23.700\n to look at a huge, huge molecules, arbitrarily large.\n\n1:42:23.700 --> 1:42:25.100\n Cause I'm also like mapping this.\n\n1:42:25.100 --> 1:42:28.740\n Can I think about this in complexity generally,\n\n1:42:28.740 --> 1:42:30.780\n like looking at a cellular automata system\n\n1:42:30.780 --> 1:42:33.020\n and saying like, what's the,\n\n1:42:33.020 --> 1:42:35.580\n can this be used as a measure of complexity\n\n1:42:35.580 --> 1:42:38.740\n for like a arbitrarily complicated system?\n\n1:42:38.740 --> 1:42:40.380\n Yeah, I think it can.\n\n1:42:40.380 --> 1:42:41.220\n It can.\n\n1:42:41.220 --> 1:42:43.860\n And I think that the question is, and what's the benefit?\n\n1:42:43.860 --> 1:42:46.540\n Cause there's plenty of, I mean,\n\n1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:48.540\n in computer science and mathematics and in physics,\n\n1:42:48.540 --> 1:42:51.540\n people have been really seriously studying complexity\n\n1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:53.180\n for a long time.\n\n1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:55.100\n And I think there's a really interesting problems\n\n1:42:55.100 --> 1:42:58.540\n of where we course grade and we lose information.\n\n1:42:58.540 --> 1:43:00.100\n And all assembly theory does really,\n\n1:43:00.100 --> 1:43:03.180\n assembly theory just explains weak emergence.\n\n1:43:03.180 --> 1:43:05.980\n And so what assembly theory says, look,\n\n1:43:05.980 --> 1:43:08.900\n going from the atoms that interact,\n\n1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:12.020\n those first replicators that build one another,\n\n1:43:12.020 --> 1:43:14.900\n assembly at the minimal level just tells you evidence\n\n1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:17.860\n that there's been replication and selection.\n\n1:43:17.860 --> 1:43:20.380\n And I think the more selected something is,\n\n1:43:20.380 --> 1:43:22.460\n the higher the assembly.\n\n1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:25.540\n And so we were able to start to know\n\n1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:27.100\n how to look for selection in the universe.\n\n1:43:27.100 --> 1:43:28.380\n If you go to the moon,\n\n1:43:28.380 --> 1:43:30.100\n there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon\n\n1:43:30.100 --> 1:43:32.900\n except the human artifacts we've left there.\n\n1:43:32.900 --> 1:43:36.020\n So again, let's go back to the sandbox.\n\n1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:37.820\n In assembly theory says,\n\n1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:40.020\n if all the sand grains could stick together,\n\n1:43:40.020 --> 1:43:42.540\n that's the infinite combinatorial explosion\n\n1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:44.740\n in the universe, that should be the default.\n\n1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:45.900\n We don't have that.\n\n1:43:45.900 --> 1:43:48.580\n Now let's assemble sand grains together\n\n1:43:48.580 --> 1:43:51.060\n and do them in every possible way.\n\n1:43:51.060 --> 1:43:54.700\n So we have a series of minimal operations\n\n1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:56.180\n that can move the sand together.\n\n1:43:56.180 --> 1:43:57.860\n But all that doesn't exist either.\n\n1:43:57.860 --> 1:43:59.900\n Now, because we have specific memory where we say,\n\n1:43:59.900 --> 1:44:01.780\n well, we're gonna put three sand grains in line\n\n1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:03.900\n or four and make a cross or a triangle\n\n1:44:03.900 --> 1:44:05.420\n or something unsymmetrical.\n\n1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:06.620\n And once we've made the triangle\n\n1:44:06.620 --> 1:44:08.380\n and the unsymmetrical thing, we remember that,\n\n1:44:08.380 --> 1:44:10.900\n we can use it again, cause on that causal chain.\n\n1:44:10.900 --> 1:44:12.420\n So what assembly theory allows you to do\n\n1:44:12.420 --> 1:44:14.620\n is go to the actual object that you exist,\n\n1:44:14.620 --> 1:44:16.060\n you find in space.\n\n1:44:16.060 --> 1:44:18.980\n And actually the way you get there is by disassembling.\n\n1:44:18.980 --> 1:44:23.340\n It's disassembly theory works by disassembling objects\n\n1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:27.660\n you have and understanding the steps to create them.\n\n1:44:27.660 --> 1:44:30.140\n And it works for molecules beautifully\n\n1:44:30.140 --> 1:44:31.740\n cause you just break bonds.\n\n1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:33.860\n But like you said, it's very difficult.\n\n1:44:33.860 --> 1:44:35.580\n It's a difficult problem to figure out\n\n1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:36.580\n how to break them apart.\n\n1:44:36.580 --> 1:44:37.580\n For molecules, it's easy.\n\n1:44:37.580 --> 1:44:40.780\n If you just keep low enough in molecular weight space,\n\n1:44:40.780 --> 1:44:41.700\n it's good enough.\n\n1:44:41.700 --> 1:44:43.820\n So it's a complete theory.\n\n1:44:43.820 --> 1:44:45.300\n When we start to think about objects,\n\n1:44:45.300 --> 1:44:46.940\n we can start to assign,\n\n1:44:46.940 --> 1:44:49.020\n we can start to think about things at different levels,\n\n1:44:49.020 --> 1:44:51.540\n different atoms, what you assign as your atom.\n\n1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:54.620\n So in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing\n\n1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:57.260\n cause the word atom, I mean smallest breakable part.\n\n1:44:57.260 --> 1:44:59.700\n So in a molecule, the atom is the bond\n\n1:44:59.700 --> 1:45:02.420\n cause you break bonds, not atoms, right?\n\n1:45:02.420 --> 1:45:06.100\n So in a car, the atom might be, I don't know,\n\n1:45:06.100 --> 1:45:09.780\n a small amount of iron or the smallest reusable part,\n\n1:45:09.780 --> 1:45:13.460\n a rivet, a piece of plastic or something.\n\n1:45:13.460 --> 1:45:14.740\n So you gotta be really careful.\n\n1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:18.460\n In a microprocessor, the atoms might be transistors.\n\n1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:23.460\n And so the amount of assembly that something has\n\n1:45:23.580 --> 1:45:26.620\n is a function, you have to look at the atom level.\n\n1:45:26.620 --> 1:45:28.180\n What are your parts?\n\n1:45:28.180 --> 1:45:29.020\n What are you counting?\n\n1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:30.780\n That's one of the things you get to choose.\n\n1:45:30.780 --> 1:45:32.740\n What is, at what scale is the atom?\n\n1:45:32.740 --> 1:45:34.740\n What is the minimal thing?\n\n1:45:34.740 --> 1:45:36.740\n I mean, there's a huge amounts of trade offs\n\n1:45:36.740 --> 1:45:39.700\n in when you approach a system and try to analyze.\n\n1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:41.340\n Like if you approach Earth,\n\n1:45:41.340 --> 1:45:43.820\n you're an alien civilization trying to study Earth,\n\n1:45:43.820 --> 1:45:45.740\n what is the atom for trying to measure\n\n1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:48.380\n the complexity of life?\n\n1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:50.540\n Is it, are humans the atoms?\n\n1:45:50.540 --> 1:45:53.500\n I would say to start with, you just use molecules.\n\n1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:56.020\n I can say for sure, if there are molecules\n\n1:45:56.020 --> 1:45:58.220\n of sufficient complexity on Earth,\n\n1:45:58.220 --> 1:45:59.820\n then I know that life has made them.\n\n1:45:59.820 --> 1:46:01.380\n And then go further and show technology.\n\n1:46:01.380 --> 1:46:03.860\n There are molecules that exist on Earth\n\n1:46:03.860 --> 1:46:06.020\n that are not possible even by biology.\n\n1:46:06.020 --> 1:46:07.180\n You needed technology\n\n1:46:07.180 --> 1:46:09.700\n and you needed microprocessors to get there.\n\n1:46:09.700 --> 1:46:11.420\n So that's really cool.\n\n1:46:11.420 --> 1:46:14.620\n And that there's a correlation between that,\n\n1:46:14.620 --> 1:46:18.580\n between the coolness of that and assembly number,\n\n1:46:18.580 --> 1:46:19.700\n whatever the measure.\n\n1:46:19.700 --> 1:46:21.580\n What's the, what would you call the measure?\n\n1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:22.500\n Assembly index.\n\n1:46:22.500 --> 1:46:23.340\n Yeah, assembly index.\n\n1:46:23.340 --> 1:46:25.660\n So there are three kind of fundamental\n\n1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:26.700\n kind of labels we have.\n\n1:46:26.700 --> 1:46:28.900\n So there's the quantity of assembly\n\n1:46:28.900 --> 1:46:31.140\n and the assembly, so if you have a box,\n\n1:46:31.140 --> 1:46:32.540\n let's just have a box of molecules.\n\n1:46:32.540 --> 1:46:34.220\n So I'm gonna have my box.\n\n1:46:34.220 --> 1:46:36.540\n We count the number of identical molecules\n\n1:46:36.540 --> 1:46:37.980\n and then we chop each molecule up\n\n1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:40.500\n in an individual molecule class\n\n1:46:40.500 --> 1:46:42.260\n and calculate the assembly number.\n\n1:46:42.260 --> 1:46:45.740\n So basically you then have a function\n\n1:46:45.740 --> 1:46:49.420\n that sums over all the molecules for each assembly\n\n1:46:49.420 --> 1:46:50.620\n and then you divide through.\n\n1:46:50.620 --> 1:46:52.340\n So you make it divide through\n\n1:46:52.340 --> 1:46:54.220\n by the number of molecules.\n\n1:46:54.220 --> 1:46:56.180\n So that's the assembly index for the box?\n\n1:46:56.180 --> 1:46:58.620\n So that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box.\n\n1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:01.020\n So basically the assembly equation we come up with\n\n1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:04.980\n is like basically the sum of e to the power\n\n1:47:04.980 --> 1:47:07.420\n of the assembly index for molecule i\n\n1:47:07.420 --> 1:47:10.540\n times the number of copies of the molecule i\n\n1:47:10.540 --> 1:47:11.460\n and then you normalize.\n\n1:47:11.460 --> 1:47:13.380\n So you sum them all up and then normalize.\n\n1:47:13.380 --> 1:47:16.380\n So some boxes are gonna be more assembled than others.\n\n1:47:16.380 --> 1:47:17.700\n Yeah, that's what they tell me.\n\n1:47:17.700 --> 1:47:19.900\n So if you were to look at me as a box,\n\n1:47:19.900 --> 1:47:23.820\n so say I'm a box, am I assembling my parts?\n\n1:47:23.820 --> 1:47:25.620\n In terms of like, how do you know,\n\n1:47:25.620 --> 1:47:27.020\n what's my assembly index?\n\n1:47:27.020 --> 1:47:28.740\n So I've been gentle.\n\n1:47:28.740 --> 1:47:30.940\n So let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you.\n\n1:47:30.940 --> 1:47:34.540\n So let's just take a pile of sand the same way as you\n\n1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:39.540\n and I would take you and just cut up all the molecules.\n\n1:47:40.140 --> 1:47:42.580\n I mean, and look at the number of copies\n\n1:47:42.580 --> 1:47:43.900\n and assembly number.\n\n1:47:43.900 --> 1:47:46.020\n So in sand, let's say there's probably gonna be\n\n1:47:46.020 --> 1:47:48.340\n nothing more than assembly number of two or three,\n\n1:47:48.340 --> 1:47:51.980\n but there might be trillions and trillions of sand grains.\n\n1:47:51.980 --> 1:47:53.860\n In your body, there might be,\n\n1:47:53.860 --> 1:47:56.180\n the assembly number is gonna be higher,\n\n1:47:56.180 --> 1:47:58.340\n but there might not be as quite as many copies\n\n1:47:58.340 --> 1:48:01.220\n because the molecular weight is higher.\n\n1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:03.020\n So you do wanna average it out.\n\n1:48:03.020 --> 1:48:04.340\n You can average, you do average it.\n\n1:48:04.340 --> 1:48:07.140\n I'm not defined by the most impressive molecules.\n\n1:48:07.140 --> 1:48:08.700\n No, no, you're an average in your volume.\n\n1:48:08.700 --> 1:48:10.500\n Well, I mean, we're just working this out,\n\n1:48:10.500 --> 1:48:13.500\n but what's really cool is you're gonna have\n\n1:48:13.500 --> 1:48:15.140\n a really high assembly.\n\n1:48:15.140 --> 1:48:16.700\n The sand will have a very low assembly.\n\n1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:19.500\n Your causal power is much higher.\n\n1:48:19.500 --> 1:48:22.940\n You get to make decisions, you're alive, you're aspiring.\n\n1:48:22.940 --> 1:48:26.580\n Assembly says something about causal power in the universe.\n\n1:48:26.580 --> 1:48:28.860\n And that's not supposed to exist\n\n1:48:28.860 --> 1:48:30.580\n because physicists don't accept\n\n1:48:30.580 --> 1:48:33.140\n that causation exists at the bottom.\n\n1:48:33.140 --> 1:48:34.580\n So I understand at the chemical level\n\n1:48:34.580 --> 1:48:37.660\n why the assembly causes causation.\n\n1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:38.580\n Why is it causation?\n\n1:48:38.580 --> 1:48:40.940\n Because it's capturing the memory.\n\n1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:41.780\n Exactly.\n\n1:48:41.780 --> 1:48:45.660\n Capturing memory, but there's not an action to it.\n\n1:48:45.660 --> 1:48:50.660\n So I'm trying to see how it leads to life.\n\n1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:52.980\n Well, it's what life does.\n\n1:48:52.980 --> 1:48:55.620\n So I think it's, we don't know.\n\n1:48:55.620 --> 1:48:57.300\n So. Yeah, that's a good question.\n\n1:48:57.300 --> 1:49:00.100\n What is life versus what does life do?\n\n1:49:00.100 --> 1:49:02.460\n Yeah, so that's, this is the definition of life.\n\n1:49:02.460 --> 1:49:04.460\n The only definition we need, right?\n\n1:49:04.460 --> 1:49:05.300\n The assembly index.\n\n1:49:05.300 --> 1:49:09.900\n It's basically that life is able to create objects\n\n1:49:09.900 --> 1:49:14.020\n in abundance that are so complex,\n\n1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:15.700\n the assembly number is so high,\n\n1:49:15.700 --> 1:49:18.700\n they can't possibly be formed in an environment\n\n1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:20.300\n where there's just random interactions.\n\n1:49:20.300 --> 1:49:21.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:21.140 --> 1:49:24.860\n So suddenly you can put life on a scale.\n\n1:49:24.860 --> 1:49:27.860\n And then life doesn't exist actually in that camp.\n\n1:49:27.860 --> 1:49:30.300\n It's just how evolved you are.\n\n1:49:30.300 --> 1:49:33.100\n And you as an object,\n\n1:49:33.100 --> 1:49:35.660\n because you have incredible causal power,\n\n1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:38.140\n you could go and, you can go and, you know,\n\n1:49:39.660 --> 1:49:43.660\n launch rockets or build cars or create drugs,\n\n1:49:43.660 --> 1:49:46.340\n or, you know, you can do so many things.\n\n1:49:46.340 --> 1:49:49.020\n You can build stuff, build more artifacts\n\n1:49:49.020 --> 1:49:52.340\n that show that you have had causal power.\n\n1:49:52.340 --> 1:49:55.340\n And that causal power was this kind of a lineage.\n\n1:49:55.340 --> 1:49:57.860\n And I think that over time,\n\n1:49:57.860 --> 1:50:02.580\n I've been realizing that physics as a discipline\n\n1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:04.900\n has a number of problems associated with it.\n\n1:50:04.900 --> 1:50:07.300\n Me as a chemist, it's kind of interesting\n\n1:50:07.300 --> 1:50:10.340\n that assembly theory, and I'm really, you know,\n\n1:50:10.340 --> 1:50:13.460\n I want to maintain some credibility in the physicists eyes,\n\n1:50:13.460 --> 1:50:15.260\n but I have to push them because they,\n\n1:50:15.260 --> 1:50:17.980\n physics is a really good discipline.\n\n1:50:17.980 --> 1:50:20.060\n It's reduced the number,\n\n1:50:20.060 --> 1:50:22.260\n physics is about reducing the belief system,\n\n1:50:22.260 --> 1:50:24.740\n but they're down to some things in their belief system,\n\n1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:27.780\n which is kind of really makes me kind of grumpy.\n\n1:50:27.780 --> 1:50:29.620\n Number one is requiring order\n\n1:50:29.620 --> 1:50:31.020\n at the beginning of the universe magically.\n\n1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:32.220\n We don't need that.\n\n1:50:32.220 --> 1:50:34.020\n The second is the second law.\n\n1:50:34.020 --> 1:50:36.740\n Well, we don't actually need that.\n\n1:50:36.740 --> 1:50:37.580\n And I...\n\n1:50:37.580 --> 1:50:39.180\n This is blasphemous.\n\n1:50:39.180 --> 1:50:42.260\n Well, in a minute, I'll recover my career in a second.\n\n1:50:42.260 --> 1:50:43.380\n Although I think the good,\n\n1:50:43.380 --> 1:50:45.140\n the only good thing about being the regis chair\n\n1:50:45.140 --> 1:50:47.860\n means I think there has to be an act of parliament to fire me.\n\n1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:48.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:49.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:50.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:50.380 --> 1:50:51.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:51.220 --> 1:50:52.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:52.060 --> 1:50:56.700\n But you can always go to Lee's Twitter and protest.\n\n1:50:56.700 --> 1:50:58.620\n And I think the third thing is that,\n\n1:50:58.620 --> 1:50:59.460\n so we've got, you know,\n\n1:50:59.460 --> 1:51:02.540\n we've got the order at the beginning.\n\n1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:03.380\n Second law.\n\n1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:06.780\n The second law and the fact that causation is emergent,\n\n1:51:06.780 --> 1:51:07.620\n right?\n\n1:51:07.620 --> 1:51:09.060\n And that time is emergent.\n\n1:51:09.060 --> 1:51:11.180\n John Carroll just turned off this program.\n\n1:51:12.180 --> 1:51:13.860\n I think he believes that it's emergent.\n\n1:51:13.860 --> 1:51:15.700\n So causation is not...\n\n1:51:15.700 --> 1:51:17.860\n That's clearly incorrect\n\n1:51:17.860 --> 1:51:19.620\n because we wouldn't exist otherwise.\n\n1:51:19.620 --> 1:51:23.460\n So physicists have kind of got confused about time.\n\n1:51:23.460 --> 1:51:25.580\n Time is a real thing.\n\n1:51:25.580 --> 1:51:27.340\n Well, I mean, so look,\n\n1:51:29.460 --> 1:51:31.140\n I'm very happy with the current description\n\n1:51:31.140 --> 1:51:32.700\n of the universe as physics give me,\n\n1:51:32.700 --> 1:51:33.980\n because I can do a lot of stuff, right?\n\n1:51:33.980 --> 1:51:36.540\n I can go to the moon with Newtonian physics, I think,\n\n1:51:36.540 --> 1:51:41.060\n and I can understand the orbit of Mercury with relativity.\n\n1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:42.900\n And so, and I can build transistors\n\n1:51:42.900 --> 1:51:43.940\n with quantum mechanics, right?\n\n1:51:43.940 --> 1:51:45.740\n And I can do all this stuff.\n\n1:51:45.740 --> 1:51:47.260\n So I'm not saying the physics is wrong.\n\n1:51:47.260 --> 1:51:50.460\n I'm just saying, if we say that time is fundamental,\n\n1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:52.940\n i.e. time is nonnegotiable, there's a global clock,\n\n1:51:52.940 --> 1:51:56.620\n I don't need to require\n\n1:51:56.620 --> 1:51:59.700\n that there's order been magically made in the past\n\n1:51:59.700 --> 1:52:03.340\n because that asymmetry is built into the way the universe is.\n\n1:52:05.460 --> 1:52:06.940\n So if time is fundamental,\n\n1:52:06.940 --> 1:52:09.540\n I mean, you've been referring to this kind of\n\n1:52:11.140 --> 1:52:13.900\n an interesting formulation of that is memory.\n\n1:52:13.900 --> 1:52:14.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:14.740 --> 1:52:18.940\n So time is hard to like put a finger on,\n\n1:52:18.940 --> 1:52:20.580\n like what the hell are we talking about?\n\n1:52:20.580 --> 1:52:21.740\n Well, it's just the direction,\n\n1:52:21.740 --> 1:52:24.620\n but memory is a construction,\n\n1:52:24.620 --> 1:52:26.660\n especially when you have like,\n\n1:52:26.660 --> 1:52:28.980\n think about these local pockets of complexity,\n\n1:52:28.980 --> 1:52:33.980\n these nonzero assembly index entities\n\n1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:36.340\n that's being constructed and they remember.\n\n1:52:37.260 --> 1:52:39.140\n Never forget molecules.\n\n1:52:39.140 --> 1:52:41.900\n But remember, the thing is I invented assembly theory.\n\n1:52:42.940 --> 1:52:44.420\n I'll tell you how I invented it.\n\n1:52:44.420 --> 1:52:46.140\n When I was a kid, I mean, the thing is,\n\n1:52:46.140 --> 1:52:48.300\n I keep making fun of myself to my research group.\n\n1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:49.620\n I've only ever had one idea.\n\n1:52:49.620 --> 1:52:52.500\n I keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or so\n\n1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:53.740\n since I had the idea.\n\n1:52:53.740 --> 1:52:54.580\n I used to be a...\n\n1:52:54.580 --> 1:52:56.460\n Well, aren't you the idea that the universe had?\n\n1:52:56.460 --> 1:52:58.500\n So it's very kind of hierarchical.\n\n1:52:58.500 --> 1:52:59.340\n Anyway, go ahead.\n\n1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:00.180\n I'm sorry.\n\n1:53:00.180 --> 1:53:02.100\n That's very poetic.\n\n1:53:02.100 --> 1:53:02.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:02.940 --> 1:53:04.820\n So I think I came up with assembly theory\n\n1:53:04.820 --> 1:53:06.100\n with the following idea.\n\n1:53:06.100 --> 1:53:09.540\n When I was a kid, I was obsessed about survival kits.\n\n1:53:09.540 --> 1:53:12.460\n What is the minimum stuff I would need\n\n1:53:12.460 --> 1:53:14.020\n to basically replicate my reality?\n\n1:53:14.020 --> 1:53:17.060\n And I love computers and I love technology\n\n1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:18.340\n or what technology is gonna become.\n\n1:53:18.340 --> 1:53:20.380\n So I imagined that I would have\n\n1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:22.860\n basically this really big truck full of stuff.\n\n1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:25.500\n And I thought, well, can I delete some of that stuff out?\n\n1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:26.500\n Can I have a blueprint?\n\n1:53:26.500 --> 1:53:29.500\n And then in the end, I kept making this smaller.\n\n1:53:29.500 --> 1:53:32.220\n I got to maybe a half a truck and then to a suitcase.\n\n1:53:32.220 --> 1:53:33.980\n And then I went, okay, well, screw it.\n\n1:53:33.980 --> 1:53:37.580\n I wanna carry my entire technology in my pocket.\n\n1:53:37.580 --> 1:53:38.620\n How do I do it?\n\n1:53:38.620 --> 1:53:43.180\n And I'm not gonna launch into Steve Jobs and iPlayer.\n\n1:53:43.180 --> 1:53:45.940\n I came up with a matchbox survival kit.\n\n1:53:45.940 --> 1:53:47.260\n In that matchbox survival kit,\n\n1:53:47.260 --> 1:53:48.540\n I would have the minimum stuff\n\n1:53:48.540 --> 1:53:50.540\n that would allow me to interact the environment,\n\n1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:54.260\n to build my shelter, to build a fishing rod,\n\n1:53:54.260 --> 1:53:57.300\n to build a water purification system.\n\n1:53:57.300 --> 1:53:59.460\n And it's kind of like, so what did I use in my box\n\n1:53:59.460 --> 1:54:01.620\n to assemble in the environment,\n\n1:54:01.620 --> 1:54:04.260\n to assemble, to assemble, to assemble?\n\n1:54:04.260 --> 1:54:07.060\n And I realized I could make a causal chain\n\n1:54:07.060 --> 1:54:08.180\n in my survival kit.\n\n1:54:08.180 --> 1:54:10.220\n So I guess that's probably why I've been obsessed\n\n1:54:10.220 --> 1:54:11.980\n with assembly theory for so long.\n\n1:54:11.980 --> 1:54:16.980\n And I was just pre configured to find it somewhere.\n\n1:54:17.580 --> 1:54:19.420\n And when I saw it in molecules,\n\n1:54:19.420 --> 1:54:24.340\n I realized that the causal structure that we say emerges\n\n1:54:24.340 --> 1:54:27.100\n and the physics kind of gets really stuck\n\n1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:28.580\n because they're saying that time,\n\n1:54:28.580 --> 1:54:29.740\n you can go backwards in time.\n\n1:54:29.740 --> 1:54:32.140\n I mean, how do we let physicists get away\n\n1:54:32.140 --> 1:54:34.340\n with the notion that we can go back in time\n\n1:54:34.340 --> 1:54:35.180\n and meet ourselves?\n\n1:54:35.180 --> 1:54:40.180\n I mean, that's clearly a very hard thing\n\n1:54:40.180 --> 1:54:45.180\n to allow, physicists would not let other sciences\n\n1:54:45.580 --> 1:54:49.100\n get away with that kind of heresy, right?\n\n1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:50.620\n So why are physicists allowed to get away with it?\n\n1:54:50.620 --> 1:54:51.460\n Let's, let's.\n\n1:54:51.460 --> 1:54:54.260\n So first of all, to push back, to play devil's advocate,\n\n1:54:54.260 --> 1:54:58.300\n you are clearly married to the idea of memory.\n\n1:54:58.300 --> 1:55:02.220\n You see in this, again, from Rick and Morty way,\n\n1:55:02.220 --> 1:55:06.380\n you see, you have these deep dreams of the universe\n\n1:55:06.380 --> 1:55:08.900\n that is writing the story through its memories,\n\n1:55:08.900 --> 1:55:10.860\n through its chemical compounds\n\n1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:12.460\n that are just building at top of each other.\n\n1:55:12.460 --> 1:55:16.020\n And then they find useful components they can reuse.\n\n1:55:16.020 --> 1:55:19.780\n And then the reused components create systems\n\n1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:21.820\n that themselves are then reused\n\n1:55:21.820 --> 1:55:24.060\n and all in this way, construct things.\n\n1:55:24.060 --> 1:55:27.860\n But when you think of that as memory,\n\n1:55:27.860 --> 1:55:31.940\n it seems like quite sad that you can walk that back.\n\n1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:34.860\n But at the same time, it feels like that memory,\n\n1:55:34.860 --> 1:55:37.060\n you can walk in both directions on that memory\n\n1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:38.020\n in terms of time.\n\n1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:39.580\n You could walk in both directions,\n\n1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:42.060\n but I don't think that that makes any sense\n\n1:55:42.060 --> 1:55:47.060\n because the problem that I have with time being reversible\n\n1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:53.460\n is that, I mean, I'm just a, you know,\n\n1:55:53.460 --> 1:55:55.220\n I'm a dumb experimental chemist, right?\n\n1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:58.940\n So I love burning stuff, burning stuff and building stuff.\n\n1:55:58.940 --> 1:56:01.220\n But when I think of reversible phenomena,\n\n1:56:01.220 --> 1:56:02.260\n I imagine in my head,\n\n1:56:02.260 --> 1:56:05.260\n I have to actually manufacture some time.\n\n1:56:05.260 --> 1:56:08.180\n I have to borrow time from the universe to do that.\n\n1:56:08.180 --> 1:56:10.100\n I can't, when anyone says,\n\n1:56:10.100 --> 1:56:13.180\n let's imagine that we can go back in time or reversibility,\n\n1:56:13.180 --> 1:56:14.020\n you can't do that.\n\n1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:15.220\n You can't step out of time.\n\n1:56:15.220 --> 1:56:17.060\n Time is nonnegotiable, it's happening.\n\n1:56:17.060 --> 1:56:20.540\n No, but see, you're assuming that time is fundamental,\n\n1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:23.780\n which most of us do when we go day to day,\n\n1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:27.300\n but it takes a leap of wild imagination\n\n1:56:27.300 --> 1:56:29.780\n to think that time is emergent.\n\n1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:30.980\n No, time is not emergent.\n\n1:56:30.980 --> 1:56:32.940\n Yeah, I mean, this is an argument we can have,\n\n1:56:32.940 --> 1:56:35.940\n but I believe I can come up with an experiment.\n\n1:56:35.940 --> 1:56:37.180\n An experiment that proves\n\n1:56:37.180 --> 1:56:38.780\n that time cannot possibly be emergent.\n\n1:56:38.780 --> 1:56:43.300\n An experiment that shows how assembly theory\n\n1:56:43.300 --> 1:56:48.180\n kind of is the way that the universe produces selection\n\n1:56:48.180 --> 1:56:50.700\n and that selection gives rise to life.\n\n1:56:50.700 --> 1:56:53.420\n And also to say, well, hang on,\n\n1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:55.340\n we could allow ourselves to have a theory\n\n1:56:55.340 --> 1:56:59.220\n that requires us to have these statements to be possible.\n\n1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:03.140\n Like we need to have order in the past,\n\n1:57:03.140 --> 1:57:06.220\n or we can use the past hypothesis,\n\n1:57:06.220 --> 1:57:10.980\n which is order in the past, but as well, okay.\n\n1:57:10.980 --> 1:57:12.820\n And we have to have an arrow of time.\n\n1:57:12.820 --> 1:57:16.500\n We have to require that entropy increases.\n\n1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:17.980\n And we have to say, and then we can say, look,\n\n1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:21.700\n the universe is completely closed and there's no novelty\n\n1:57:21.700 --> 1:57:23.940\n or that novelty is predetermined.\n\n1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:26.420\n What I'm saying is very, very important\n\n1:57:26.420 --> 1:57:28.660\n that time is fundamental, which means,\n\n1:57:28.660 --> 1:57:30.060\n if you think about it,\n\n1:57:30.060 --> 1:57:32.660\n the universe becomes more and more novel each step.\n\n1:57:32.660 --> 1:57:33.940\n It generates there's more states\n\n1:57:33.940 --> 1:57:35.860\n in the next step than it was before.\n\n1:57:35.860 --> 1:57:37.580\n So that means bigger search.\n\n1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:39.460\n So what I'm saying is that the universe\n\n1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:41.660\n wasn't capable of consciousness at day one,\n\n1:57:43.220 --> 1:57:45.780\n actually, because it didn't have enough states.\n\n1:57:45.780 --> 1:57:48.780\n But today the universe is, so it's like how?\n\n1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:51.580\n All right, all right, hold on a second.\n\n1:57:51.580 --> 1:57:54.060\n Now we've pissed off the panpsychist too, okay.\n\n1:57:55.700 --> 1:57:57.580\n No, this is brilliant, sorry.\n\n1:57:57.580 --> 1:58:00.220\n Part of me is just joking, having fun with this thing,\n\n1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:02.500\n but because you're saying a lot of brilliant stuff\n\n1:58:02.500 --> 1:58:05.660\n and I'm trying to slow it down before my brain explodes.\n\n1:58:05.660 --> 1:58:08.100\n So, because I want to break apart\n\n1:58:08.100 --> 1:58:10.340\n some of the fascinating things you're saying.\n\n1:58:10.340 --> 1:58:14.700\n So novelty, novelty is increasing in the universe\n\n1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:16.980\n because the number of states is increasing.\n\n1:58:16.980 --> 1:58:18.460\n What do you mean by states?\n\n1:58:18.460 --> 1:58:20.780\n So I think the physicists almost got everything right.\n\n1:58:20.780 --> 1:58:22.940\n I can't fault them at all.\n\n1:58:22.940 --> 1:58:24.460\n I just think there's a little bit of dogma.\n\n1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:25.820\n I'm just trying to play devil's advocate.\n\n1:58:25.820 --> 1:58:28.780\n I'm very happy to be entirely wrong on this, right?\n\n1:58:28.780 --> 1:58:31.060\n I'm not right on many things at all,\n\n1:58:31.060 --> 1:58:34.060\n but if I can make less assumptions\n\n1:58:34.060 --> 1:58:35.940\n about the universe with this,\n\n1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:38.100\n then potentially that's a more powerful way\n\n1:58:38.100 --> 1:58:39.740\n of looking at things.\n\n1:58:39.740 --> 1:58:41.820\n If you think of time as fundamental,\n\n1:58:41.820 --> 1:58:43.460\n you can make less assumptions overall.\n\n1:58:43.460 --> 1:58:45.740\n Exactly, if time is fundamental,\n\n1:58:45.740 --> 1:58:48.020\n I don't need to add on a magical second law\n\n1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:49.500\n because the second law comes out of the fact\n\n1:58:49.500 --> 1:58:52.700\n the universe is actually, there's more states available.\n\n1:58:52.700 --> 1:58:54.580\n I mean, we might even be able to do weird things\n\n1:58:54.580 --> 1:58:55.900\n like dark energy in the universe\n\n1:58:55.900 --> 1:58:58.660\n might actually just be time, right?\n\n1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:00.940\n Yeah, but then you have to still have to explain\n\n1:59:00.940 --> 1:59:02.540\n why time is fundamental,\n\n1:59:02.540 --> 1:59:04.460\n because I can give you one explanation\n\n1:59:04.460 --> 1:59:07.020\n that's simpler than time and say God.\n\n1:59:07.020 --> 1:59:08.700\n You know, like just because it's simple\n\n1:59:08.700 --> 1:59:12.620\n doesn't mean it's, okay, you still have to explain God\n\n1:59:12.620 --> 1:59:14.220\n and you still have to explain time.\n\n1:59:14.220 --> 1:59:15.580\n Like why is it fundamental?\n\n1:59:15.580 --> 1:59:18.020\n So let's just say existence is default,\n\n1:59:18.020 --> 1:59:19.580\n which means time is the default.\n\n1:59:19.580 --> 1:59:22.020\n So how did you go from the existence\n\n1:59:22.020 --> 1:59:24.940\n of the time to the default? Well, we exist, right?\n\n1:59:24.940 --> 1:59:26.980\n So let's just be very.\n\n1:59:26.980 --> 1:59:28.940\n We're yet to talk about what exist means.\n\n1:59:28.940 --> 1:59:30.340\n All right, let's go all the way back.\n\n1:59:30.340 --> 1:59:31.180\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.\n\n1:59:31.180 --> 1:59:32.540\n I think it's very poetic and beautiful\n\n1:59:32.540 --> 1:59:34.180\n what you're weaving into this.\n\n1:59:34.180 --> 1:59:37.220\n I don't think this conversation is even about the assembly,\n\n1:59:38.180 --> 1:59:41.100\n which is fascinating and we'll keep mentioning it\n\n1:59:41.100 --> 1:59:42.980\n in the index on this idea,\n\n1:59:42.980 --> 1:59:46.940\n that I don't think is necessarily connected to time.\n\n1:59:46.940 --> 1:59:49.180\n Oh, I think it is deeply connected.\n\n1:59:49.180 --> 1:59:50.260\n I can't explain it yet.\n\n1:59:50.260 --> 1:59:52.580\n So you don't think everything you've said\n\n1:59:52.580 --> 1:59:56.100\n about assembly theory and assembly index\n\n1:59:56.100 --> 1:59:58.620\n can still be correct even if time is emergent?\n\n1:59:58.620 --> 2:00:01.660\n So yeah, right now, assembly theory appears to work.\n\n2:00:01.660 --> 2:00:04.860\n I appear to be able to measure objects of high assembly\n\n2:00:04.860 --> 2:00:06.660\n in a mass spectrometer and look at their abundance\n\n2:00:06.660 --> 2:00:08.180\n and you know, all that's fine, right?\n\n2:00:08.180 --> 2:00:10.540\n It's a nice, if nothing else, it's a nice way\n\n2:00:10.540 --> 2:00:13.220\n of looking at how molecules can compress things.\n\n2:00:14.420 --> 2:00:17.180\n Now, am I saying that a time has to be fundamental,\n\n2:00:17.180 --> 2:00:18.740\n not emergent for assembly theory to work?\n\n2:00:18.740 --> 2:00:23.300\n No, I think I'm saying that the universe,\n\n2:00:23.300 --> 2:00:25.700\n it appears that the universe has many different ways\n\n2:00:25.700 --> 2:00:26.540\n of using time.\n\n2:00:26.540 --> 2:00:28.340\n You could have three different types of time.\n\n2:00:28.340 --> 2:00:29.980\n You could just have time that's,\n\n2:00:29.980 --> 2:00:30.820\n the way I would think of it,\n\n2:00:30.820 --> 2:00:33.300\n if you want to hold onto emergent time,\n\n2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:35.580\n I think that's fine, let's do that for a second.\n\n2:00:35.580 --> 2:00:37.460\n Hold onto emergent time\n\n2:00:37.460 --> 2:00:39.580\n and the universe is just doing its thing.\n\n2:00:39.580 --> 2:00:41.980\n Then assembly time only exists when the universe\n\n2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:43.780\n starts to write memories through bonds.\n\n2:00:43.780 --> 2:00:45.660\n So let's just say there's rocks running around,\n\n2:00:45.660 --> 2:00:49.340\n you know, when the bond happens and selection starts,\n\n2:00:49.340 --> 2:00:54.340\n suddenly there are, the universe is remembering cause\n\n2:00:54.580 --> 2:00:57.140\n in the past and those structures will have effects\n\n2:00:57.140 --> 2:00:57.980\n in the future.\n\n2:00:57.980 --> 2:01:00.740\n So suddenly a new type of time emerges at that point,\n\n2:01:00.740 --> 2:01:02.340\n which has a direction.\n\n2:01:02.340 --> 2:01:04.220\n And I think Sean Carroll at this point\n\n2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:06.540\n might even turn the podcast back on and go,\n\n2:01:06.540 --> 2:01:08.820\n okay, I can deal with that, that's fine.\n\n2:01:08.820 --> 2:01:10.940\n But I'm just basically trying to condense the conversation,\n\n2:01:10.940 --> 2:01:13.060\n say, hey, let's just have time fundamental\n\n2:01:13.060 --> 2:01:14.940\n and see how that screws with people's minds.\n\n2:01:14.940 --> 2:01:15.780\n Why?\n\n2:01:15.780 --> 2:01:17.700\n You're triggering people by saying fundamental.\n\n2:01:17.700 --> 2:01:18.540\n Why not?\n\n2:01:18.540 --> 2:01:19.860\n Well, you just say, like, let's say.\n\n2:01:19.860 --> 2:01:21.700\n Why am I, look, I'm walking through the wall.\n\n2:01:21.700 --> 2:01:26.700\n Why should I grow up in a world where time,\n\n2:01:26.980 --> 2:01:28.060\n I don't go back in time.\n\n2:01:28.060 --> 2:01:30.740\n I don't meet myself in the past.\n\n2:01:30.740 --> 2:01:32.780\n There are no one, there are no aliens coming\n\n2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:34.580\n from the future, right?\n\n2:01:34.580 --> 2:01:35.420\n You know, it's just like.\n\n2:01:35.420 --> 2:01:38.660\n No, no, no, but that's not, no, no, no, hold on a second.\n\n2:01:38.660 --> 2:01:41.780\n That's like saying we're talking about biology\n\n2:01:41.780 --> 2:01:44.140\n or like evolutionary psychology\n\n2:01:44.140 --> 2:01:46.260\n and you're saying, okay, let's just assume\n\n2:01:46.260 --> 2:01:48.540\n that clothing is fundamental.\n\n2:01:48.540 --> 2:01:50.380\n People wearing clothes is fundamental.\n\n2:01:50.380 --> 2:01:52.340\n It's like, no, no, no, wait a minute.\n\n2:01:52.340 --> 2:01:55.700\n You can't, like, I think you're gonna get in a lot of trouble\n\n2:01:55.700 --> 2:01:57.620\n if you assume time is fundamental.\n\n2:01:57.620 --> 2:01:58.460\n Why?\n\n2:01:58.460 --> 2:02:00.060\n Give me one reason why I'm getting into trouble\n\n2:02:00.060 --> 2:02:01.340\n with time being fundamental.\n\n2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:04.340\n Because you might not understand\n\n2:02:04.340 --> 2:02:08.100\n the origins of this memory that might be deeper.\n\n2:02:08.100 --> 2:02:11.180\n Like this memory, that could be a thing\n\n2:02:11.180 --> 2:02:14.860\n that's explaining the construction of these\n\n2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:19.260\n higher complexities better than just saying\n\n2:02:19.260 --> 2:02:23.740\n it's a search, it's chemicals doing a search\n\n2:02:23.740 --> 2:02:28.740\n for reusable structures that they can like\n\n2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:32.700\n then use as bricks to build a house.\n\n2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:34.420\n Okay, so I accept that.\n\n2:02:34.420 --> 2:02:37.900\n So let's go back a second because it's a kind of,\n\n2:02:37.900 --> 2:02:40.700\n I wanted to drop the time bomb at this part\n\n2:02:40.700 --> 2:02:42.180\n because I think we can carry on discussing it\n\n2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:45.620\n for many, many, many, many, many days, many months.\n\n2:02:46.700 --> 2:02:50.900\n But I'm happy to accept that it might be wrong.\n\n2:02:50.900 --> 2:02:53.820\n But what I would like to do is imagine a universe\n\n2:02:53.820 --> 2:02:56.580\n where time is fundamental and time is emergent\n\n2:02:56.580 --> 2:03:00.340\n and ask, let's just then talk about causation\n\n2:03:00.340 --> 2:03:02.900\n because physicists require that causation.\n\n2:03:02.900 --> 2:03:04.420\n So this is where I'm gonna go.\n\n2:03:04.420 --> 2:03:08.420\n Causation emerges and it doesn't exist at the micro scale.\n\n2:03:08.420 --> 2:03:09.900\n Well, that clearly is wrong\n\n2:03:09.900 --> 2:03:12.220\n because if causation has to emerge at the macro scale,\n\n2:03:12.220 --> 2:03:13.660\n life cannot emerge.\n\n2:03:13.660 --> 2:03:15.180\n So how does life emerge?\n\n2:03:15.180 --> 2:03:17.940\n Life requires molecules to bump into each other,\n\n2:03:17.940 --> 2:03:20.580\n produce replicators, those replicators\n\n2:03:20.580 --> 2:03:21.860\n need to produce polymers.\n\n2:03:21.860 --> 2:03:24.620\n There needs to be cause and effect at the molecular level.\n\n2:03:24.620 --> 2:03:26.540\n There needs to be an agardic, non agardic\n\n2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:29.620\n to an agardic transition at some point.\n\n2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:34.620\n And those replicators have consequence,\n\n2:03:35.260 --> 2:03:37.500\n material consequence in the universe.\n\n2:03:37.500 --> 2:03:39.700\n Physicists just say, oh, you know what?\n\n2:03:39.700 --> 2:03:42.460\n I'm gonna have a bunch of particles in a box.\n\n2:03:42.460 --> 2:03:44.820\n I'm gonna think about it in a Newtonian way\n\n2:03:44.820 --> 2:03:48.020\n and a quantum way and I'll add on an arrow of time\n\n2:03:48.020 --> 2:03:49.260\n so I can label things\n\n2:03:50.140 --> 2:03:51.820\n and causation will happen magically later.\n\n2:03:51.820 --> 2:03:52.660\n Well, how?\n\n2:03:52.660 --> 2:03:55.780\n Explain causation and they can't.\n\n2:03:55.780 --> 2:03:58.540\n The only way I can reconcile causation\n\n2:03:58.540 --> 2:04:00.620\n is having a fundamental time\n\n2:04:00.620 --> 2:04:03.260\n because this allows me to have a deterministic universe\n\n2:04:03.260 --> 2:04:05.500\n that creates novelty.\n\n2:04:05.500 --> 2:04:08.300\n And there's so many things to unpack here\n\n2:04:08.300 --> 2:04:09.780\n but let's go back to the point.\n\n2:04:09.780 --> 2:04:12.580\n You said, can assembly theory work with emergent time?\n\n2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:16.540\n Sure it can, but it doesn't give me a deep satisfaction\n\n2:04:16.540 --> 2:04:21.060\n about how causation and assembly gives rise\n\n2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:24.620\n to these objects that move through time and space.\n\n2:04:24.620 --> 2:04:27.180\n And again, what am I saying to bring it back?\n\n2:04:27.180 --> 2:04:31.260\n I can say without fear, take this water bottle\n\n2:04:31.260 --> 2:04:32.100\n and look at this water bottle\n\n2:04:32.100 --> 2:04:32.940\n and look at the features on it.\n\n2:04:32.940 --> 2:04:35.780\n There's writing, you've got a load of them.\n\n2:04:35.780 --> 2:04:38.620\n I know that causal structures gave rise to this.\n\n2:04:38.620 --> 2:04:40.860\n In fact, I'm not looking at just one water bottle here.\n\n2:04:40.860 --> 2:04:42.180\n I'm looking at every water bottle\n\n2:04:42.180 --> 2:04:44.540\n that's ever been conceived of by humanity.\n\n2:04:44.540 --> 2:04:46.980\n This here is a special object.\n\n2:04:46.980 --> 2:04:48.700\n In fact, Leibniz knew this.\n\n2:04:48.700 --> 2:04:52.060\n Leibniz who was at the same time of Newton,\n\n2:04:52.060 --> 2:04:53.220\n he kind of got stuck.\n\n2:04:53.220 --> 2:04:56.020\n I think Leibniz actually invented assembly theory.\n\n2:04:56.020 --> 2:04:58.660\n He gave soul, the soul that you see in objects\n\n2:04:58.660 --> 2:05:01.100\n wasn't the mystical soul, it is assembly.\n\n2:05:01.100 --> 2:05:03.980\n It is the fact there's been a history of objects related\n\n2:05:03.980 --> 2:05:06.780\n and without the object in the past,\n\n2:05:06.780 --> 2:05:08.380\n this object wouldn't exist.\n\n2:05:08.380 --> 2:05:12.660\n There is a lineage and there is conserved structures,\n\n2:05:12.660 --> 2:05:14.780\n causal structures have given rise to those.\n\n2:05:17.060 --> 2:05:17.900\n Fair enough.\n\n2:05:17.900 --> 2:05:20.340\n And you're saying it's just a simpler view\n\n2:05:20.340 --> 2:05:23.300\n if time is fundamental.\n\n2:05:23.300 --> 2:05:25.700\n And it shakes the physicist's cage a bit, right?\n\n2:05:25.700 --> 2:05:27.880\n Because I'm gonna say, but I think that.\n\n2:05:29.100 --> 2:05:32.500\n I just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages.\n\n2:05:32.500 --> 2:05:35.580\n I think that, I mean, I would say that, you know,\n\n2:05:35.580 --> 2:05:37.940\n Lee Smolin, I don't want to speak for Lee.\n\n2:05:37.940 --> 2:05:39.940\n I mean, I'm talking to Lee about this.\n\n2:05:39.940 --> 2:05:41.820\n I think Lee also is an agreement\n\n2:05:41.820 --> 2:05:43.740\n that time has to be fundamental,\n\n2:05:43.740 --> 2:05:45.180\n but I think he goes further.\n\n2:05:45.180 --> 2:05:46.860\n You know, even in space,\n\n2:05:46.860 --> 2:05:49.940\n I don't think you can go back to the same place in space.\n\n2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:51.340\n I've been to Austin a few times now.\n\n2:05:51.340 --> 2:05:54.100\n This is my, I think third time I've been to Austin.\n\n2:05:54.100 --> 2:05:55.420\n Is Austin in the same place?\n\n2:05:55.420 --> 2:05:58.460\n No, the solar system is moving through space.\n\n2:05:59.740 --> 2:06:01.900\n I'm not back in the same space.\n\n2:06:01.900 --> 2:06:02.960\n Locally I am.\n\n2:06:03.860 --> 2:06:06.300\n Every event in the universe is unique.\n\n2:06:07.780 --> 2:06:08.780\n In space.\n\n2:06:08.780 --> 2:06:09.620\n And time.\n\n2:06:09.620 --> 2:06:10.580\n And time.\n\n2:06:10.580 --> 2:06:13.220\n Doesn't mean we can't go back though.\n\n2:06:13.220 --> 2:06:17.220\n I mean, you know, let's just, you know,\n\n2:06:17.220 --> 2:06:20.860\n rest this conversation, which was beautiful,\n\n2:06:20.860 --> 2:06:22.540\n with a quote from the Rolling Stones\n\n2:06:22.540 --> 2:06:25.220\n that you can't always get what you want,\n\n2:06:25.220 --> 2:06:27.780\n which is you want time to be fundamental,\n\n2:06:27.780 --> 2:06:30.060\n but if you try, you'll get what you need,\n\n2:06:30.060 --> 2:06:32.120\n which is assembly theory.\n\n2:06:32.120 --> 2:06:34.300\n Okay, let me ask you about,\n\n2:06:34.300 --> 2:06:36.700\n continue talking about complexity,\n\n2:06:36.700 --> 2:06:41.700\n and to clarify with this beautiful theory of yours\n\n2:06:42.140 --> 2:06:43.660\n that you're developing,\n\n2:06:43.660 --> 2:06:45.300\n and I'm sure we'll continue developing\n\n2:06:45.300 --> 2:06:48.280\n both in the lab and in theory.\n\n2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:52.220\n Yeah, it can't be said enough,\n\n2:06:52.220 --> 2:06:56.020\n just the ideas you're playing with in your head are just,\n\n2:06:56.020 --> 2:06:58.100\n and we've been talking about are just beautiful.\n\n2:06:58.100 --> 2:07:01.100\n So if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally,\n\n2:07:02.540 --> 2:07:05.700\n maybe in an admiring romantic way,\n\n2:07:05.700 --> 2:07:09.180\n how does complexity emerge from simple rules?\n\n2:07:09.180 --> 2:07:11.260\n The why, the how.\n\n2:07:11.260 --> 2:07:14.980\n Okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there.\n\n2:07:14.980 --> 2:07:17.420\n I would say that the problem I have right now is,\n\n2:07:17.420 --> 2:07:20.280\n I mean, you're right, we can, about time as well.\n\n2:07:20.280 --> 2:07:22.580\n The problem is I have this hammer called assembly,\n\n2:07:22.580 --> 2:07:24.500\n and everything I see is a nail.\n\n2:07:24.500 --> 2:07:27.460\n So now let's just apply it to all sorts of things.\n\n2:07:27.460 --> 2:07:28.900\n We take the Bernard instability.\n\n2:07:28.900 --> 2:07:31.100\n The Bernard instability is you have oil,\n\n2:07:32.300 --> 2:07:35.120\n if you heat up oil, let's say on a frying pan,\n\n2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:37.480\n when you get convection, you get honeycomb patterns.\n\n2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:40.580\n Take the formation of snowflakes, right?\n\n2:07:40.580 --> 2:07:45.580\n Take the emergence of a tropical storm,\n\n2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:47.580\n or the storm on Jupiter.\n\n2:07:47.580 --> 2:07:50.100\n When people say, let's talk about complexity in general,\n\n2:07:50.100 --> 2:07:51.600\n what they're saying is,\n\n2:07:51.600 --> 2:07:54.400\n let's take this collection of objects\n\n2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:56.880\n that are correlated in some way,\n\n2:07:56.880 --> 2:08:00.300\n and try and work out how many moving parts there are,\n\n2:08:00.300 --> 2:08:02.940\n how this got, how this exists.\n\n2:08:02.940 --> 2:08:04.820\n So what people have been doing for a very long time\n\n2:08:04.820 --> 2:08:09.300\n is taking complexity and counting what they've lost,\n\n2:08:09.300 --> 2:08:11.140\n calculating the entropy.\n\n2:08:11.140 --> 2:08:13.900\n And the reason why I'm pushing very hard on assembly\n\n2:08:13.900 --> 2:08:16.380\n is entropy tells you how much you've lost.\n\n2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:18.800\n It doesn't tell you the microstates are gone.\n\n2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:21.740\n But if you embrace the bottom up with assembly,\n\n2:08:21.740 --> 2:08:26.340\n those states, and you then understand the causal chain\n\n2:08:26.340 --> 2:08:28.740\n that gives rise to the emergence.\n\n2:08:28.740 --> 2:08:31.500\n So what I think assembly will help us do\n\n2:08:31.500 --> 2:08:34.340\n is understand weak emergence at the very least,\n\n2:08:34.340 --> 2:08:39.340\n and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way.\n\n2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:42.780\n And I've been fascinated with complexity theory\n\n2:08:42.780 --> 2:08:43.580\n for many years.\n\n2:08:43.580 --> 2:08:46.680\n I mean, as soon as I could,\n\n2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:48.500\n I learned of the Mandelbrot set,\n\n2:08:48.500 --> 2:08:52.660\n and I could just type it up in my computer and run it,\n\n2:08:52.660 --> 2:08:55.800\n and just show it and see it kind of unfold.\n\n2:08:55.800 --> 2:08:58.820\n It was just this kind of,\n\n2:08:58.820 --> 2:09:01.440\n this mathematical reality that existed in front of me,\n\n2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:03.980\n I just found incredible.\n\n2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:07.100\n But then I realized that actually we were cheating.\n\n2:09:07.100 --> 2:09:09.500\n We're putting in the boundary conditions all the time.\n\n2:09:09.500 --> 2:09:11.500\n We're putting in information.\n\n2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:13.620\n And so when people talk to me\n\n2:09:13.620 --> 2:09:16.060\n about the complexity of things,\n\n2:09:16.060 --> 2:09:18.700\n I say, but relative what, how do you measure them?\n\n2:09:18.700 --> 2:09:23.540\n So my attempt, my small attempt, naive attempt,\n\n2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:25.420\n because there's many greater minds than mine\n\n2:09:25.420 --> 2:09:27.500\n on the planet right now thinking about this properly.\n\n2:09:27.500 --> 2:09:29.860\n And you've had some of them on the podcast, right?\n\n2:09:29.860 --> 2:09:31.740\n Just absolutely fantastic.\n\n2:09:33.100 --> 2:09:35.620\n But I'm wondering if we might be able to reformat\n\n2:09:35.620 --> 2:09:39.880\n the way we would explore algorithmic complexity\n\n2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:41.100\n using assembly.\n\n2:09:41.100 --> 2:09:45.260\n What's the minimum number of constraints we need\n\n2:09:45.260 --> 2:09:47.860\n in our system for this to unfold?\n\n2:09:47.860 --> 2:09:50.860\n So whether it's like, if you take some particles\n\n2:09:50.860 --> 2:09:52.620\n and put them in a box,\n\n2:09:52.620 --> 2:09:55.420\n at a certain box size, you get quasi crystallinity\n\n2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:57.100\n coming out, right?\n\n2:09:57.100 --> 2:10:00.540\n But that quite, that emergence, it's not magic.\n\n2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:03.780\n It must come from the boundary conditions you put in.\n\n2:10:03.780 --> 2:10:07.100\n So all I'm saying is a lot of the complexity that we see\n\n2:10:07.100 --> 2:10:10.240\n is a direct read of the constraints we put in,\n\n2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:11.980\n but we just don't understand.\n\n2:10:11.980 --> 2:10:14.620\n So as I said earlier to the poor origin of life chemists,\n\n2:10:14.620 --> 2:10:17.340\n you know, origin of life is a scam.\n\n2:10:17.340 --> 2:10:20.220\n I would say lots of the complexity calculation theory\n\n2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:21.660\n is a bit of a scam\n\n2:10:21.660 --> 2:10:22.900\n because we put the constraints in,\n\n2:10:22.900 --> 2:10:25.260\n but we don't count them correctly.\n\n2:10:25.260 --> 2:10:26.140\n And I'm wondering if...\n\n2:10:26.140 --> 2:10:28.340\n Oh, you're thinking and starting to drop\n\n2:10:28.340 --> 2:10:31.780\n as assembly theory, assembly index\n\n2:10:31.780 --> 2:10:33.300\n is a way to count to the constraints.\n\n2:10:33.300 --> 2:10:34.140\n Yes, that's it.\n\n2:10:34.140 --> 2:10:35.020\n That's all it is.\n\n2:10:35.020 --> 2:10:36.780\n So assembly theory doesn't do,\n\n2:10:36.780 --> 2:10:40.060\n doesn't lower any of the importance of complexity theory,\n\n2:10:40.060 --> 2:10:42.180\n but it allows us to go across domains\n\n2:10:42.180 --> 2:10:44.460\n and start to compare things,\n\n2:10:44.460 --> 2:10:46.220\n compare the complexity of a molecule,\n\n2:10:46.220 --> 2:10:49.700\n of a microprocessor, of the text you've writing,\n\n2:10:49.700 --> 2:10:52.020\n of the music you may compose.\n\n2:10:53.460 --> 2:10:55.220\n You've tweeted, quote,\n\n2:10:55.220 --> 2:10:58.340\n \"'Assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood\n\n2:10:58.340 --> 2:11:01.900\n we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.'\n\n2:11:01.900 --> 2:11:03.460\n So we've applied assembly theory\n\n2:11:03.460 --> 2:11:06.060\n to cellular automata in life and chemistry.\n\n2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:09.580\n What does Nietzsche have to do with assembly theory?\n\n2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:12.040\n Oh, that gets me into free will and everything.\n\n2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:14.540\n So let me say that again.\n\n2:11:14.540 --> 2:11:16.620\n Assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood\n\n2:11:16.620 --> 2:11:20.380\n we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.\n\n2:11:20.380 --> 2:11:23.460\n Limited freedom, I suppose, is referring to the fact\n\n2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:28.460\n that there's constraints or what is radical freedom?\n\n2:11:28.780 --> 2:11:30.180\n What is freedom?\n\n2:11:30.180 --> 2:11:33.420\n So Sartre was like believed in absolute freedom\n\n2:11:34.340 --> 2:11:38.620\n and that he could do whatever he wanted in his imagination.\n\n2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:41.800\n And Nietzsche understood that his freedom\n\n2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:43.180\n was somewhat more limited.\n\n2:11:44.100 --> 2:11:46.180\n And it kind of takes me back to this computer game\n\n2:11:46.180 --> 2:11:47.940\n that I played when I was 10.\n\n2:11:47.940 --> 2:11:49.980\n So I think it's called Dragon's Lair.\n\n2:11:49.980 --> 2:11:51.780\n Okay.\n\n2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:52.620\n Do you know Dragon's Lair?\n\n2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:54.140\n I think I know Dragon's Lair, yeah.\n\n2:11:54.140 --> 2:11:56.440\n Dragon's Lair, I knew I was being conned, right?\n\n2:11:56.440 --> 2:11:57.820\n Dragon's Lair, when you play the game,\n\n2:11:57.820 --> 2:11:59.060\n you're lucky that you grew up\n\n2:11:59.060 --> 2:12:01.580\n in a basically procedurally generated world.\n\n2:12:01.580 --> 2:12:03.200\n That was RPG a little bit.\n\n2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:05.660\n No, it's like, is it turn based play?\n\n2:12:05.660 --> 2:12:06.500\n Was it?\n\n2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:07.320\n No.\n\n2:12:07.320 --> 2:12:08.160\n It was a role playing game.\n\n2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:09.000\n Role playing.\n\n2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.660\n But really good graphics and one of the first laser disks.\n\n2:12:11.660 --> 2:12:13.580\n And when you actually flick the stick,\n\n2:12:13.580 --> 2:12:16.580\n you took, it's like it was like a graphical adventure game\n\n2:12:16.580 --> 2:12:17.980\n with animation.\n\n2:12:17.980 --> 2:12:18.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:18.820 --> 2:12:19.980\n And when I played this game, I really, you know,\n\n2:12:19.980 --> 2:12:22.060\n you could get through the game in 12 minutes\n\n2:12:22.060 --> 2:12:23.900\n if you knew what you were doing without making mistakes,\n\n2:12:23.900 --> 2:12:25.700\n just play the disk, play the disk, play a disk.\n\n2:12:25.700 --> 2:12:27.460\n So it was just about timing.\n\n2:12:27.460 --> 2:12:29.640\n And actually it was a complete fraud\n\n2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:33.660\n because all the animation has been prerecorded on the disk.\n\n2:12:33.660 --> 2:12:36.100\n It's like the Black Mirror, the first interactive\n\n2:12:36.100 --> 2:12:37.460\n where they had all the, you know,\n\n2:12:37.460 --> 2:12:41.440\n several million kind of permutations of the movie\n\n2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:42.780\n that you could select on Netflix.\n\n2:12:42.780 --> 2:12:44.700\n I've forgotten the name of it.\n\n2:12:44.700 --> 2:12:47.660\n So this was exactly that in the laser disk.\n\n2:12:47.660 --> 2:12:50.820\n So you basically go left, go right, fight the yoga,\n\n2:12:50.820 --> 2:12:52.060\n slay the dragon.\n\n2:12:52.060 --> 2:12:53.860\n And when you flick the joystick at the right time,\n\n2:12:53.860 --> 2:12:55.860\n it just goes to the next animation to play.\n\n2:12:55.860 --> 2:12:56.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:56.700 --> 2:12:57.540\n It's not really generating it.\n\n2:12:57.540 --> 2:12:58.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:58.380 --> 2:13:00.500\n And I played that game and I knew I was being had.\n\n2:13:01.460 --> 2:13:02.300\n So.\n\n2:13:02.300 --> 2:13:03.120\n Oh, okay.\n\n2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:03.960\n I see, I see.\n\n2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:07.300\n So to you, Dragon Lair is the first time you realized\n\n2:13:07.300 --> 2:13:09.380\n that free will is an illusion.\n\n2:13:09.380 --> 2:13:10.220\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:10.220 --> 2:13:14.980\n And why does assembly theory give you hints\n\n2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:17.140\n about free will, whether it's an illusion or not?\n\n2:13:17.140 --> 2:13:18.840\n Yeah, so no, so not tightly.\n\n2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:22.700\n If I do think I have some will and I think I am an agent\n\n2:13:22.700 --> 2:13:24.860\n and I think I can interact and I can play around\n\n2:13:24.860 --> 2:13:27.100\n with the model I have of the world\n\n2:13:27.100 --> 2:13:28.280\n and the cost functions, right?\n\n2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:30.260\n And I can hack my own cost functions,\n\n2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:32.340\n which means I have a little bit of free will.\n\n2:13:32.340 --> 2:13:35.180\n But as much as I want to do stuff in the universe,\n\n2:13:35.180 --> 2:13:37.340\n I don't think I could suddenly say,\n\n2:13:37.340 --> 2:13:38.540\n I mean, actually this is ridiculous.\n\n2:13:38.540 --> 2:13:39.900\n Cause now I say I could try and do it, right?\n\n2:13:39.900 --> 2:13:41.180\n Like I'm suddenly give up everything\n\n2:13:41.180 --> 2:13:44.140\n and become a rapper tomorrow, right?\n\n2:13:44.140 --> 2:13:45.860\n Maybe I could try that,\n\n2:13:45.860 --> 2:13:48.660\n but I don't have sufficient agency\n\n2:13:48.660 --> 2:13:50.020\n to make that necessarily happen.\n\n2:13:50.020 --> 2:13:51.440\n I'm on a trajectory.\n\n2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:52.340\n So when in Dragon's Lair,\n\n2:13:52.340 --> 2:13:56.500\n I know that I have some trajectories that I can play with\n\n2:13:56.500 --> 2:13:58.900\n where Sartre realized he thought\n\n2:13:58.900 --> 2:14:00.740\n that he had no assembly, no memory.\n\n2:14:00.740 --> 2:14:03.380\n He could just leap across and do everything.\n\n2:14:03.380 --> 2:14:06.820\n And Nietzsche said, okay, I realize I don't have\n\n2:14:06.820 --> 2:14:09.300\n full freedom, but I have some freedom.\n\n2:14:09.300 --> 2:14:11.300\n And the assembly theory basically says that,\n\n2:14:11.300 --> 2:14:14.180\n it says, if you have these constraints in your past,\n\n2:14:14.180 --> 2:14:16.420\n they limit what you were able to do in the future,\n\n2:14:16.420 --> 2:14:19.300\n but you can use them to do amazing things.\n\n2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:23.860\n Let's say I'm a poppy plant and I'm creating some opiates.\n\n2:14:23.860 --> 2:14:25.780\n Opiates are really interesting molecules.\n\n2:14:25.780 --> 2:14:27.900\n I mean, they're obviously great for medicine,\n\n2:14:27.900 --> 2:14:29.740\n cause great problems in society.\n\n2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:33.420\n But let's imagine we fast forward a billion years,\n\n2:14:33.420 --> 2:14:37.780\n what will the opioids look like in a billion years?\n\n2:14:37.780 --> 2:14:39.320\n Well, we can guess because we can see\n\n2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:41.300\n how those proteins will evolve\n\n2:14:41.300 --> 2:14:44.900\n and we can see how the secondary metabolites will change.\n\n2:14:44.900 --> 2:14:46.460\n But they can't go radical.\n\n2:14:46.460 --> 2:14:48.580\n They can't suddenly become, I don't know,\n\n2:14:48.580 --> 2:14:52.260\n like a molecule that you find in an OLED in a display.\n\n2:14:52.260 --> 2:14:53.300\n They will have some,\n\n2:14:53.300 --> 2:14:56.940\n they will be limited by the causal chain that produced them.\n\n2:14:56.940 --> 2:14:58.020\n And that's what I'm getting at,\n\n2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:03.020\n saying we are unpredictably predictable\n\n2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:07.520\n or predictably unpredictable within a constraint\n\n2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:08.860\n on the trajectory we're on.\n\n2:15:08.860 --> 2:15:10.120\n Yeah, so the predictably part\n\n2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:12.460\n is the constraints of the trajectory\n\n2:15:12.460 --> 2:15:14.820\n and the unpredictable part is the part\n\n2:15:14.820 --> 2:15:16.620\n that you still haven't really clarified\n\n2:15:16.620 --> 2:15:19.980\n the origin of the little bit of freedom.\n\n2:15:19.980 --> 2:15:20.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:20.820 --> 2:15:22.500\n So you're just arguing,\n\n2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:26.720\n you're basically saying that radical freedom is impossible.\n\n2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:29.080\n You're really operating in a world of constraints\n\n2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:31.760\n that are constrained by the memory of the trajectory\n\n2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:33.740\n of the chemistry that led to who you are.\n\n2:15:33.740 --> 2:15:38.740\n Okay, but even just a tiny bit of freedom,\n\n2:15:39.020 --> 2:15:44.020\n even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages,\n\n2:15:45.940 --> 2:15:49.340\n if you can move around in that cage a little bit,\n\n2:15:49.340 --> 2:15:50.580\n you're free.\n\n2:15:50.580 --> 2:15:51.420\n I agree.\n\n2:15:51.420 --> 2:15:55.740\n And so the question is in assembly theory,\n\n2:15:55.740 --> 2:15:57.500\n if we're thinking about free will,\n\n2:15:57.500 --> 2:15:59.720\n where does the little bit of freedom come from?\n\n2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:03.700\n What is the eye that can decide to be a rapper?\n\n2:16:03.700 --> 2:16:06.940\n What, why, what is that?\n\n2:16:06.940 --> 2:16:10.440\n That's a cute little trick we've convinced each other of\n\n2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:13.460\n so we can do fun tricks at parties\n\n2:16:13.460 --> 2:16:15.320\n or is there something fundamental\n\n2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:18.860\n that allows us to feel free, to be free?\n\n2:16:18.860 --> 2:16:21.860\n I think that that's the question that I wanna answer.\n\n2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:24.940\n I know you wanna answer it and I think it's so profound.\n\n2:16:25.820 --> 2:16:27.140\n Let me have a go at it.\n\n2:16:27.140 --> 2:16:30.260\n I would say that I don't take the stance of Sam Harris\n\n2:16:30.260 --> 2:16:31.780\n because I think Sam Harris, when he said,\n\n2:16:31.780 --> 2:16:33.180\n the way he says it is almost,\n\n2:16:33.180 --> 2:16:34.020\n it's really interesting.\n\n2:16:34.020 --> 2:16:35.020\n I'd love to talk to him about it.\n\n2:16:35.020 --> 2:16:37.660\n Sam Harris almost thinks himself out of existence, right?\n\n2:16:37.660 --> 2:16:40.620\n Because, do you know what I mean?\n\n2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:43.540\n Yeah, well, I mean, he has different views\n\n2:16:43.540 --> 2:16:45.340\n on consciousness versus free will.\n\n2:16:45.340 --> 2:16:47.380\n I think he saves himself with consciousness.\n\n2:16:47.380 --> 2:16:49.980\n He thinks himself out of existence with free will.\n\n2:16:49.980 --> 2:16:50.900\n Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n2:16:50.900 --> 2:16:53.260\n So I mean, there's no point, right?\n\n2:16:53.260 --> 2:16:54.080\n So I...\n\n2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:55.820\n He's a leaf floating on a river.\n\n2:16:55.820 --> 2:17:00.820\n Yeah, I think that he, I don't know,\n\n2:17:00.820 --> 2:17:03.580\n I'd love to ask him whether he really believes that\n\n2:17:03.580 --> 2:17:04.620\n and then we could play some games.\n\n2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:05.460\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:17:05.460 --> 2:17:06.380\n No, no, I then would say,\n\n2:17:06.380 --> 2:17:08.900\n I'll get him to play a game of cards with me\n\n2:17:08.900 --> 2:17:11.580\n and I'll work out the conditions on which he says no,\n\n2:17:11.580 --> 2:17:13.420\n and then I'll get him to the conditions he says yes,\n\n2:17:13.420 --> 2:17:15.620\n and then I'll trap him in his logical inconsistency\n\n2:17:15.620 --> 2:17:17.180\n with that argument.\n\n2:17:17.180 --> 2:17:19.980\n Because at some point when he loses enough money\n\n2:17:19.980 --> 2:17:21.880\n or the prospect of losing enough money,\n\n2:17:23.220 --> 2:17:26.900\n there's a way of basically mapping out a series of...\n\n2:17:26.900 --> 2:17:30.740\n So what will is about, let's not call it free will,\n\n2:17:30.740 --> 2:17:34.540\n but what will is about is to have a series of decisions\n\n2:17:34.540 --> 2:17:36.820\n equally weighted in front of you.\n\n2:17:36.820 --> 2:17:39.620\n And those decisions aren't necessarily energy minimization.\n\n2:17:39.620 --> 2:17:43.220\n Those decisions are a function of the model\n\n2:17:43.220 --> 2:17:45.940\n you've made in your mind, you're in your simulation.\n\n2:17:45.940 --> 2:17:48.740\n And the way you've interacted in reality\n\n2:17:48.740 --> 2:17:52.100\n and also other interactions you're having\n\n2:17:52.100 --> 2:17:55.260\n with other individuals and happenstance.\n\n2:17:55.260 --> 2:18:00.260\n And I think that there's a little bit of delay in time.\n\n2:18:00.260 --> 2:18:03.800\n So I think what you're able to do is say,\n\n2:18:03.800 --> 2:18:06.640\n well, I'm gonna do the counterfactual.\n\n2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:08.160\n I've done all of them.\n\n2:18:08.160 --> 2:18:10.760\n And I'm gonna go this way.\n\n2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:12.060\n And you probably don't know why.\n\n2:18:12.060 --> 2:18:14.800\n I think free will is actually very complex interaction\n\n2:18:14.800 --> 2:18:18.760\n between your unconscious and your conscious brain.\n\n2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:20.760\n And I think the reason why we're arguing about it\n\n2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:23.800\n is so interesting in that we just,\n\n2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:26.960\n some people outsource their free will\n\n2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.800\n to their unconscious brain.\n\n2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:31.160\n And some people try and overthink\n\n2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:33.080\n the free will and the conscious brain.\n\n2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:35.440\n I would say that Sam Harris has realized\n\n2:18:35.440 --> 2:18:36.880\n his conscious brain doesn't have free will,\n\n2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:38.600\n but his unconscious brain does.\n\n2:18:38.600 --> 2:18:39.640\n That's my guess, right?\n\n2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:42.040\n And that he can't have access to the unconscious brain.\n\n2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:43.640\n Yeah, and that's kind of annoying.\n\n2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:46.380\n And so he's just, he's going to, through meditation,\n\n2:18:46.380 --> 2:18:48.020\n come to acceptance with that fact.\n\n2:18:48.020 --> 2:18:50.480\n Yeah, it's just maybe okay.\n\n2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:55.000\n But I do think that I have the ability to make decisions\n\n2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:56.000\n and I like my decisions.\n\n2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:58.520\n In fact, I mean, this is an argument I have\n\n2:18:58.520 --> 2:19:02.320\n with some people that some days I feel\n\n2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:04.800\n I have no free will and it's just an illusion.\n\n2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:06.640\n And this is one, and it makes me more radical,\n\n2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:10.580\n if you like, you know, that I get to explore\n\n2:19:10.580 --> 2:19:11.600\n more of the state space.\n\n2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:13.640\n And I'm like, I'm going to try and affect the world now.\n\n2:19:13.640 --> 2:19:15.240\n I'm really going to ask the question\n\n2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:19.680\n that maybe I dare not ask or do the thing I dare not do.\n\n2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:21.800\n And that allows me to kind of explore more.\n\n2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:25.520\n It's funny that if you truly accept\n\n2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:30.520\n that there's no free will, that is a kind of radical freedom.\n\n2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:36.440\n It's funny, but you're, because the little bit\n\n2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:40.000\n of the illusion under that framework that you have\n\n2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:43.960\n that you can make choices, if choice is just an illusion\n\n2:19:43.960 --> 2:19:46.800\n of psychology, you can do whatever the hell you want.\n\n2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:47.640\n That's the.\n\n2:19:47.640 --> 2:19:48.840\n But we don't, do we?\n\n2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:49.680\n And I think.\n\n2:19:49.680 --> 2:19:51.520\n But because you don't truly accept\n\n2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:56.520\n that you think that there's like, you think there's a choice\n\n2:19:56.840 --> 2:20:00.960\n which is why you don't just do whatever the hell you want.\n\n2:20:00.960 --> 2:20:03.000\n Like you feel like there's some responsibility\n\n2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:05.560\n for making the wrong choice, which is why you don't do it.\n\n2:20:05.560 --> 2:20:07.480\n But if you truly accept that the choice\n\n2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:12.040\n has already been made, then you can go,\n\n2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:14.240\n I don't know what is the most radical thing.\n\n2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:19.800\n I mean, but yeah, I don't, I wonder what,\n\n2:20:19.800 --> 2:20:21.840\n what am I preventing myself from doing\n\n2:20:21.840 --> 2:20:23.440\n that I would really want to do?\n\n2:20:24.680 --> 2:20:26.120\n Probably like humor stuff.\n\n2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:31.120\n Like I would love to, if I could like save a game,\n\n2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:34.520\n do the thing and then reload it later,\n\n2:20:34.520 --> 2:20:37.080\n like do undo, it probably would be humor.\n\n2:20:37.080 --> 2:20:40.320\n Just to do something like super hilarious.\n\n2:20:42.440 --> 2:20:43.840\n That's super embarrassing.\n\n2:20:43.840 --> 2:20:46.640\n And then just go, I mean, it's basically just fun.\n\n2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:47.960\n I would add more fun to the world.\n\n2:20:47.960 --> 2:20:51.120\n I mean, I sometimes do that as I've, you know,\n\n2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:56.120\n I sometimes I try and mess up my reality in unusual ways\n\n2:20:56.360 --> 2:20:59.320\n by just doing things because I'm bored, but not bored.\n\n2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:00.600\n I'm not expressing this very well.\n\n2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:02.520\n I think that this is a really interesting problem\n\n2:21:02.520 --> 2:21:05.560\n that perhaps the hard sciences don't really understand\n\n2:21:05.560 --> 2:21:06.640\n that they are responsible for\n\n2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:09.480\n because the question about how life emerged\n\n2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:12.280\n and how intelligence emerges and consciousness and free will\n\n2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:14.480\n they're all ultimately boiling down\n\n2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:15.720\n to some of the same mechanics.\n\n2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:19.280\n I think, my feeling is that they are the same problem\n\n2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:20.920\n again and again and again.\n\n2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:24.760\n The transition from a, you know, a boring world\n\n2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:26.800\n or a world in which there is no selection.\n\n2:21:26.800 --> 2:21:28.560\n So I wonder if free will has something to do\n\n2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:29.840\n with selection and models.\n\n2:21:29.840 --> 2:21:32.520\n And also the models you're generating in the brain\n\n2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:34.160\n and also your, the amount of memory,\n\n2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:35.960\n your working memory have available at any one time\n\n2:21:35.960 --> 2:21:37.480\n to generate counterfactuals.\n\n2:21:37.480 --> 2:21:38.320\n Well, that's fascinating.\n\n2:21:38.320 --> 2:21:42.120\n So like the decision making process is a kind of selection\n\n2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:43.760\n and that could be just another,\n\n2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:48.200\n yet another manifestation of the selection mechanism\n\n2:21:48.200 --> 2:21:50.320\n that's pervasive throughout the universe.\n\n2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:52.640\n Okay, that's fascinating to think about.\n\n2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:56.960\n Yeah, there's not some kind of fundamental,\n\n2:21:56.960 --> 2:21:59.280\n it's own thing or something like that.\n\n2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:01.960\n That is just yet another example of selection.\n\n2:22:01.960 --> 2:22:06.280\n Yeah, and in the universe that's intrinsically open,\n\n2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:08.640\n you want to do that because you generate novelty.\n\n2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:10.680\n You mentioned something about,\n\n2:22:10.680 --> 2:22:13.920\n do cellular automata exist outside the human mind\n\n2:22:13.920 --> 2:22:16.040\n in our little offline conversation?\n\n2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:18.760\n Why is that an interesting question?\n\n2:22:18.760 --> 2:22:22.400\n So cellular automata, complexity,\n\n2:22:22.400 --> 2:22:24.280\n what's the relationship between complexity\n\n2:22:24.280 --> 2:22:28.880\n and the human mind and trees falling in the forest?\n\n2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:30.520\n Infrastructure, so the CA,\n\n2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:34.000\n so when John von Neumann and Conway and Feynman\n\n2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:35.800\n were doing CA, it was doing on paper.\n\n2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:37.200\n CA is cellular automata.\n\n2:22:37.200 --> 2:22:38.880\n Just drawing them on paper.\n\n2:22:38.880 --> 2:22:41.520\n How awesome is that, that they were doing cellular automata\n\n2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:44.520\n on paper and then they were doing it on a computer\n\n2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:48.760\n that takes like forever to print out anything and program.\n\n2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:49.600\n Sure.\n\n2:22:49.600 --> 2:22:51.000\n People are now with the TikTok,\n\n2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:54.400\n kids these days with the TikTok don't understand\n\n2:22:54.400 --> 2:22:57.080\n how amazing it is to just play with cellular automata,\n\n2:22:57.080 --> 2:23:00.000\n arbitrarily changing the rules as you want,\n\n2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:00.960\n the initial conditions,\n\n2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:04.040\n and see the beautiful patterns emerge,\n\n2:23:04.040 --> 2:23:06.200\n sing with fractals, all of that.\n\n2:23:06.200 --> 2:23:07.560\n You've just given me a brilliant idea.\n\n2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:09.520\n I wonder if there's a TikTok account that's just dedicated\n\n2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:11.280\n to putting out CA rules and if there isn't,\n\n2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:12.600\n we should make one.\n\n2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:14.960\n 100% and that will get.\n\n2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:16.640\n So we have millions of views.\n\n2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:17.720\n Millions, yes.\n\n2:23:17.720 --> 2:23:20.240\n No, it'll get dozens.\n\n2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:21.440\n We'll just have it running.\n\n2:23:21.440 --> 2:23:25.440\n So look, I kind of, I love CAs.\n\n2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:30.120\n Yeah, no.\n\n2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:32.000\n We just have to make one.\n\n2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.120\n I actually, a few years ago,\n\n2:23:34.120 --> 2:23:36.120\n I made some robots that talk to each other,\n\n2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:40.000\n chemical robots that played the game of Hex,\n\n2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.920\n invented by John Nash, by doing chemistry.\n\n2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:44.920\n And they communicated via Twitter,\n\n2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:46.520\n which were experiments they were doing.\n\n2:23:46.520 --> 2:23:49.760\n And they had a lookup table of experiments\n\n2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:51.680\n and robot one said, I'm doing experiment 10.\n\n2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:53.680\n And the other robot, okay, I'll do experiment one then.\n\n2:23:53.680 --> 2:23:55.760\n And they communicated via Twitter.\n\n2:23:55.760 --> 2:23:57.280\n Publicly or DMs?\n\n2:23:57.280 --> 2:23:58.680\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:23:58.680 --> 2:24:01.400\n Can you maybe quickly explain what the game of Hex is?\n\n2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:04.280\n Yes, so it's basically a hexagonal board\n\n2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:07.440\n and you try and basically you color each element\n\n2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:08.840\n on the board of each hexagon\n\n2:24:08.840 --> 2:24:10.640\n and you try and get from one side to the other\n\n2:24:10.640 --> 2:24:12.440\n and the other one tries to block you.\n\n2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:13.840\n How are they connected?\n\n2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:14.680\n So what are the robots?\n\n2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:16.720\n So it's a chemical.\n\n2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:17.560\n Yeah, let's go back.\n\n2:24:17.560 --> 2:24:18.880\n So there are two robots.\n\n2:24:18.880 --> 2:24:20.640\n Each robot was doing dye chemistry.\n\n2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:23.040\n So making RGB, red, green, blue, red, green, blue,\n\n2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:24.160\n red, green, blue.\n\n2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:26.200\n And they could just choose from experiments\n\n2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:28.480\n to do red, green, blue.\n\n2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:29.480\n Initially I said to my group,\n\n2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:31.520\n we need to make two chemical robots that play chess.\n\n2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:33.440\n And my group were like, that's too hard.\n\n2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:35.320\n No, go away.\n\n2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:36.760\n But anyway, so we had the robot.\n\n2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:41.760\n By the way, people listening to this should probably know\n\n2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:46.920\n that Lee Cronin is an amazing group of brilliant people.\n\n2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:48.800\n He's exceptionally well published.\n\n2:24:48.800 --> 2:24:52.200\n He's written a huge number of amazing papers.\n\n2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:55.680\n Whenever he calls himself stupid\n\n2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:57.920\n and is a sign of humility,\n\n2:24:57.920 --> 2:25:00.240\n and I deeply respect that and appreciate it.\n\n2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:01.960\n So people listening to this should know\n\n2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:04.320\n this is a world class scientist\n\n2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:05.640\n who doesn't take himself seriously,\n\n2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:07.800\n which I really appreciate and love.\n\n2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:11.720\n Anywho, talking about serious science,\n\n2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:16.000\n we're back to your group rejecting your idea\n\n2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:21.000\n of chemical robots playing chess via dyes.\n\n2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:24.560\n So you went to a simpler game of Hex.\n\n2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:26.320\n Okay, so what else?\n\n2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:27.640\n The team that did it were brilliant.\n\n2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:31.480\n I think they still have PTSD from doing it.\n\n2:25:31.480 --> 2:25:32.600\n Cause I said, this is a workshop.\n\n2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:36.760\n What I'd often do is I have about 60 people on my team.\n\n2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:38.240\n And occasionally before lockdown,\n\n2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:40.000\n I would say, I'm a bit bored.\n\n2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:41.640\n We're gonna have a workshop on something.\n\n2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:42.640\n Who wants to come?\n\n2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:44.800\n And then basically about 20 people turn up to my office\n\n2:25:44.800 --> 2:25:46.680\n and I say, we're gonna do this mad thing.\n\n2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:49.360\n And then it would just self organize.\n\n2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:51.120\n And some of them would be like, no, I'm not doing this.\n\n2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:54.520\n And then you get left with the happy dozen.\n\n2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:56.080\n And what we did is we built this robot\n\n2:25:56.080 --> 2:25:57.800\n and doing dye chemistry is really easy.\n\n2:25:57.800 --> 2:25:59.040\n You can just take two molecules,\n\n2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:00.880\n react them together and change color.\n\n2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:03.040\n And what I wanted to do is have a palette\n\n2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:04.520\n of different molecules.\n\n2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:07.000\n You can react combinatorially and get different colors.\n\n2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:08.040\n So you've got two robots.\n\n2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:09.440\n And I went, wouldn't it be cool\n\n2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:12.040\n if the robots basically shared\n\n2:26:12.040 --> 2:26:14.120\n the same list of reactions to do.\n\n2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:15.680\n And they said, oh, and because of,\n\n2:26:15.680 --> 2:26:18.720\n then you could do a kind of multi core chemistry.\n\n2:26:18.720 --> 2:26:19.560\n Like they weren't,\n\n2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:21.880\n so you'd have two chemical reactions going on at once\n\n2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:23.720\n and they could basically outsource the problem.\n\n2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:25.280\n But they're sharing the same tape.\n\n2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:26.120\n Exactly.\n\n2:26:26.120 --> 2:26:26.960\n Okay.\n\n2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:27.800\n So robot one would say, I'm gonna do,\n\n2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:28.920\n I'm gonna do experiment one.\n\n2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:30.840\n And the other robot says, I'll do experiment 100.\n\n2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:32.840\n And then they could cross it off.\n\n2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:33.680\n But I wanted to make it.\n\n2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:34.760\n That's brilliant, by the way.\n\n2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:35.600\n I wanted to make.\n\n2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:36.440\n That is genius.\n\n2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:37.280\n Sorry.\n\n2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:38.280\n Well, I wanted to make it groovier.\n\n2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:41.960\n And I said, look, let's have them competing to make,\n\n2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:43.680\n so they're playing a game of hex.\n\n2:26:43.680 --> 2:26:46.400\n And so when the robot does an experiment\n\n2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:48.440\n and the more blue the dye,\n\n2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:51.160\n the more it gets the higher chance it gets\n\n2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:53.440\n to make the move it wants on the hex board.\n\n2:26:53.440 --> 2:26:55.320\n So if it gets a red color is like,\n\n2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:57.520\n it gets down weighted in the other robot.\n\n2:26:57.520 --> 2:26:59.400\n And so what the robots could do is they play,\n\n2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:01.000\n each player move.\n\n2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.880\n And cause the fitness function or the optimization function\n\n2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:05.280\n was to make the color blue,\n\n2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:09.240\n they started to invent reactions\n\n2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:11.080\n we didn't, weren't on the list.\n\n2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:13.120\n And they did this by not cleaning\n\n2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:14.720\n because we made cleaning optional.\n\n2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:17.400\n So when one robot realized if it didn't clean its pipes,\n\n2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:18.800\n it could get blue more quickly.\n\n2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:19.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:20.480\n And the other robot realized that.\n\n2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:21.680\n So it was like getting dirty as well.\n\n2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:22.520\n And they, they.\n\n2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:26.320\n Unintended consequences of super intelligence.\n\n2:27:26.320 --> 2:27:27.240\n Okay.\n\n2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:28.080\n But.\n\n2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:28.920\n That was the game.\n\n2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:29.740\n And we.\n\n2:27:29.740 --> 2:27:30.580\n Communicating through Twitter though.\n\n2:27:30.580 --> 2:27:31.760\n They were, they were doing it through Twitter\n\n2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:33.280\n and Twitter bland them a couple of times.\n\n2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:34.760\n I said, come on, you've got a couple of robots\n\n2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:35.600\n doing chemistry.\n\n2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:36.420\n It's really cool.\n\n2:27:36.420 --> 2:27:37.260\n Stop banning them.\n\n2:27:37.260 --> 2:27:38.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:38.100 --> 2:27:39.400\n But in the end they had, we had to take them off Twitter\n\n2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:41.160\n and they just communicated via a server.\n\n2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:43.080\n Cause it was just, there were people saying,\n\n2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:43.920\n you can still find it.\n\n2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:46.680\n Cronin lab one and Cronin lab two on Twitter.\n\n2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:49.920\n And it was like, make move, wait, you know, mix A and B,\n\n2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:51.360\n wait 10 seconds.\n\n2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:52.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:53.360\n Answer blue, you know.\n\n2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:56.060\n I really find it super compelling\n\n2:27:56.060 --> 2:27:59.680\n that you would have a chemical entity\n\n2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:03.120\n that's communicating with the world.\n\n2:28:03.120 --> 2:28:04.200\n That was one of the things I want to do\n\n2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:05.900\n with my origin of life reaction, right?\n\n2:28:05.900 --> 2:28:10.160\n Is basically have a, have a reactor.\n\n2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:12.000\n That's basically just randomly enumerating\n\n2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.760\n for chemical space and have some kind of cycle\n\n2:28:14.760 --> 2:28:17.220\n and then read out what the molecules reading out\n\n2:28:17.220 --> 2:28:20.820\n using a mass spectrometer and then convert that to text\n\n2:28:20.820 --> 2:28:23.560\n and publish it on Twitter and then wait until it says\n\n2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:24.400\n I'm alive.\n\n2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:27.120\n I reckon that would get, I reckon that,\n\n2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:28.880\n that Twitter account would get a lot of followers.\n\n2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:29.720\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:30.560\n And I'm still trying to convince my group\n\n2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:32.720\n that we should just make an origin of life Twitter account.\n\n2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:36.000\n Where it's going blue and it's like, hello, testing.\n\n2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:37.360\n I'm here.\n\n2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:38.300\n Well, I'll share it.\n\n2:28:38.300 --> 2:28:39.140\n I like it.\n\n2:28:39.140 --> 2:28:40.680\n I particularly enjoy this idea\n\n2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:46.680\n of a non human entity communicating with the world\n\n2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:48.880\n via human designed social network.\n\n2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:55.240\n It's quite a, quite a beautiful idea.\n\n2:28:55.240 --> 2:28:59.200\n How we were talking about CA's existing\n\n2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:00.240\n outside the human mind.\n\n2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:01.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:02.600\n So I really admire Stephen Wolfram.\n\n2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:05.400\n I think he's a genius, clearly a genius\n\n2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:06.400\n and trapped in is actually,\n\n2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:08.280\n it's like a problem with being so smart\n\n2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:11.560\n is you get trapped in your own mind, right?\n\n2:29:11.560 --> 2:29:13.400\n And I've, I tried to actually,\n\n2:29:13.400 --> 2:29:15.200\n I tried to convince Stephen that assembly theory\n\n2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:16.040\n wasn't nonsense.\n\n2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:17.840\n He was like, no, it's just nonsense.\n\n2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:18.800\n I was a little bit sad by that.\n\n2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:20.080\n So nonsense applied,\n\n2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:22.760\n even if it applied to the simplest construct\n\n2:29:22.760 --> 2:29:25.040\n of a one dimensional cellular automata, for example.\n\n2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:25.880\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:26.700\n Well, I mean, actually,\n\n2:29:26.700 --> 2:29:28.320\n maybe I'm doing myself a bit too down.\n\n2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:30.960\n It was just as a theory was coming through\n\n2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:33.200\n and I didn't really know how to explain it,\n\n2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:35.040\n but we are going to use assembly theory\n\n2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:36.640\n and CA's in cellular automata,\n\n2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:38.640\n but I wanted to,\n\n2:29:38.640 --> 2:29:42.640\n what I was really curious about is why people marvel.\n\n2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:44.520\n I mean, you marvel CA's and their complexity.\n\n2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:47.160\n And I said, well, hang on that complexity is baked in\n\n2:29:47.160 --> 2:29:50.480\n because if you play the game of life in a CA,\n\n2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:52.680\n you have to run it on a computer.\n\n2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:53.900\n You have to have a,\n\n2:29:53.900 --> 2:29:55.660\n you have to do a number of operations,\n\n2:29:55.660 --> 2:29:57.200\n put in the boundary conditions.\n\n2:29:57.200 --> 2:29:59.840\n So is it surprising that you get this structure out?\n\n2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:02.880\n Is it manufactured by the boundary conditions?\n\n2:30:02.880 --> 2:30:06.240\n And it is interesting because I think\n\n2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:09.320\n a cellular automata running them\n\n2:30:10.540 --> 2:30:11.840\n is teaching me something about\n\n2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:14.040\n what real numbers are and aren't.\n\n2:30:14.040 --> 2:30:15.140\n I haven't quite got there yet.\n\n2:30:15.140 --> 2:30:16.800\n I was playing on the airplane coming over.\n\n2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:17.640\n I'm just realized,\n\n2:30:17.640 --> 2:30:20.080\n I have no idea what real numbers are really.\n\n2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:20.920\n And I was like, well,\n\n2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:24.200\n I do actually have some notion of what real numbers are.\n\n2:30:24.200 --> 2:30:28.840\n And I think thinking about real numbers as functions\n\n2:30:28.840 --> 2:30:30.880\n rather than numbers is more appropriate.\n\n2:30:30.880 --> 2:30:33.600\n And then if you then apply that to CA's,\n\n2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:36.160\n then you're saying, well, actually,\n\n2:30:36.160 --> 2:30:39.960\n why am I seeing this complexity in this rule?\n\n2:30:39.960 --> 2:30:42.640\n Is it, you know, is it,\n\n2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:44.720\n you've got this deterministic system\n\n2:30:44.720 --> 2:30:48.080\n and yet you get this incredible structure coming out.\n\n2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:51.360\n Well, isn't that what you'd get with any real number\n\n2:30:51.360 --> 2:30:54.320\n as you apply it as a function\n\n2:30:54.320 --> 2:30:57.280\n and you're trying to read it out to an arbitrary position?\n\n2:30:58.520 --> 2:31:00.280\n And I wonder if CA's are just helping me,\n\n2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:02.360\n well, my misunderstanding of CA's\n\n2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:03.600\n might be helping me understand them\n\n2:31:03.600 --> 2:31:04.420\n in terms of real numbers.\n\n2:31:04.420 --> 2:31:05.260\n I don't know what you think.\n\n2:31:05.260 --> 2:31:07.440\n Yeah, well, the functions,\n\n2:31:07.440 --> 2:31:10.800\n but the devil's in the function.\n\n2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:13.440\n It's like, which is the function\n\n2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:16.840\n that's generating your real number.\n\n2:31:16.840 --> 2:31:20.800\n Like that, it seems like it's very important\n\n2:31:20.800 --> 2:31:22.720\n the specific algorithm of that function\n\n2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:25.160\n because some lead to something super trivial,\n\n2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:27.280\n some lead to something that's all chaotic\n\n2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:30.880\n and some lead to things that are just walked\n\n2:31:30.880 --> 2:31:35.400\n that fine line of complexity and structure.\n\n2:31:35.400 --> 2:31:36.240\n I think we agree.\n\n2:31:36.240 --> 2:31:37.200\n So let's take it back a second.\n\n2:31:37.200 --> 2:31:40.800\n So take the logistic map or something, logistic equation,\n\n2:31:40.800 --> 2:31:42.400\n where you have this equation,\n\n2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:46.560\n which is you don't know what's gonna happen at n plus one,\n\n2:31:46.560 --> 2:31:48.920\n but once you've done n plus one, you know full time,\n\n2:31:48.920 --> 2:31:50.400\n you can't predict it.\n\n2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:53.640\n For me, CA's and logistic equation feel similar.\n\n2:31:53.640 --> 2:31:57.400\n And I think what's incredibly interesting\n\n2:31:57.400 --> 2:32:02.400\n and I share your kind of wonder at running a CA,\n\n2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:05.080\n but also I'm saying, well,\n\n2:32:05.080 --> 2:32:06.640\n what is it about the boundary conditions\n\n2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:08.600\n and the way I'm running that calculation?\n\n2:32:08.600 --> 2:32:10.200\n So in my group, with my team,\n\n2:32:10.200 --> 2:32:12.080\n we actually made a chemical CA.\n\n2:32:12.080 --> 2:32:13.080\n We made Game of Life.\n\n2:32:13.080 --> 2:32:15.120\n We actually made a physical grid.\n\n2:32:15.120 --> 2:32:16.440\n I haven't been able to publish this paper.\n\n2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:18.880\n It's been trapped in purgatory for a long time,\n\n2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:19.720\n but it might be about.\n\n2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:20.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:21.400\n You wrote it up as a paper,\n\n2:32:21.400 --> 2:32:23.080\n how to do a chemical formulation of the Game of Life,\n\n2:32:23.080 --> 2:32:23.920\n which is played.\n\n2:32:23.920 --> 2:32:25.800\n We made a chemical computer and little cells.\n\n2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:26.960\n And I was playing Game of Life.\n\n2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:28.280\n With the BZ reactions,\n\n2:32:28.280 --> 2:32:31.280\n each cell would pulse on and off, on and off, on and off.\n\n2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:34.280\n We have little stirrer bars and we have little gates.\n\n2:32:34.280 --> 2:32:37.280\n And we actually played Conway's Game of Life in there.\n\n2:32:37.280 --> 2:32:38.880\n And we got structures in that.\n\n2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:41.920\n We got structures in that game from the chemistry\n\n2:32:41.920 --> 2:32:44.320\n that you wouldn't expect from the actual CA.\n\n2:32:44.320 --> 2:32:46.520\n So that was kind of cool in that.\n\n2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:50.440\n Cause they're interacting outside of the cells more.\n\n2:32:50.440 --> 2:32:52.200\n So what's happening is you're getting noise.\n\n2:32:52.200 --> 2:32:55.400\n So the thing is that you've got this BZ reaction\n\n2:32:55.400 --> 2:32:56.920\n that gives on off, on off, on off,\n\n2:32:56.920 --> 2:32:58.800\n but there's also a wake\n\n2:32:58.800 --> 2:33:00.960\n and those wakes constructively interfere\n\n2:33:00.960 --> 2:33:05.960\n or in such a non trivial way that's non deterministic.\n\n2:33:07.760 --> 2:33:11.040\n And the non determinism in the system\n\n2:33:11.040 --> 2:33:12.720\n gives very rich dynamics.\n\n2:33:12.720 --> 2:33:14.000\n And I was wondering if I could physically\n\n2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:16.960\n make a chemical computer with this CA\n\n2:33:18.120 --> 2:33:20.160\n that gives me something different.\n\n2:33:20.160 --> 2:33:25.160\n I can't get in a silicon representation of a CA\n\n2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:27.080\n where all the states are clean.\n\n2:33:27.080 --> 2:33:29.440\n Cause you don't have the noise trailing\n\n2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:30.680\n into the next round.\n\n2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:32.080\n You just have the state.\n\n2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:33.760\n So the paper in particular,\n\n2:33:33.760 --> 2:33:37.040\n so that's just a beautiful idea to use a chemical computer\n\n2:33:37.040 --> 2:33:39.280\n to construct the cellular automaton,\n\n2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:41.280\n the famous one of game of life.\n\n2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:42.320\n But it's also interesting.\n\n2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:45.800\n And it's a really interesting scientific question\n\n2:33:45.800 --> 2:33:48.360\n of whether some kind of random perturbations\n\n2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:51.080\n or some source of randomness\n\n2:33:51.080 --> 2:33:56.080\n can have a significant constructive effect\n\n2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:00.320\n on the complexity of the system.\n\n2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:03.120\n And indeed, I mean, whether it's random\n\n2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:04.720\n or just non deterministic\n\n2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:08.920\n and can we bake in that non determinism at the beginning?\n\n2:34:08.920 --> 2:34:10.560\n I wonder what is the,\n\n2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:12.480\n I'm trying to think of what is the encoding space.\n\n2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:14.280\n The encoding space is pretty big.\n\n2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:19.120\n We have 49 stirrups of 49 cells,\n\n2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:22.000\n 49 chem bits all connected to one another\n\n2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:23.720\n and like an analog computer,\n\n2:34:23.720 --> 2:34:27.000\n but being read out discreetly as the BZ reaction.\n\n2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:30.280\n So just to say the BZ reaction is a chemical oscillator.\n\n2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:31.440\n And what happened in each cell\n\n2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:33.080\n is it goes between red and blue.\n\n2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:34.960\n So two Russians discovered it,\n\n2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:36.400\n Belouzov and Sapkinsky.\n\n2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:38.440\n I think Belouzov first proposed it\n\n2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:39.520\n and everyone said, you're crazy.\n\n2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:40.720\n It breaks the second law.\n\n2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:42.760\n And Sapkinsky said, no, it doesn't break the second law.\n\n2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:44.080\n It's consuming a fuel.\n\n2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:47.560\n And so, and then, and it's like,\n\n2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:50.360\n there's a lot of chemistry hidden\n\n2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:52.440\n in the Russian literature actually,\n\n2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:54.760\n because Russians just wrote it in Russian.\n\n2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:56.600\n They didn't publish it in English speaking journals.\n\n2:34:56.600 --> 2:34:57.560\n It's heartbreaking actually.\n\n2:34:57.560 --> 2:35:01.720\n Well, it's sad and it's great that it's there, right?\n\n2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:02.560\n It's not lost.\n\n2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:05.120\n I'm sure we will find a way of translating it properly.\n\n2:35:05.120 --> 2:35:08.800\n Well, the silver lining slash greater sadness\n\n2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:11.200\n of all of this is there's probably ideas\n\n2:35:11.200 --> 2:35:12.880\n in English speaking.\n\n2:35:12.880 --> 2:35:16.080\n Like there's ideas in certain disciplines\n\n2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:20.120\n that if discovered by other disciplines\n\n2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:22.400\n would crack open some of the biggest mysteries\n\n2:35:22.400 --> 2:35:23.600\n in those disciplines.\n\n2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:26.360\n Like computer science, for example,\n\n2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:30.120\n is trying to solve problems\n\n2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:32.840\n like nobody else has ever tried to solve problems.\n\n2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:35.520\n As if it's not already been all addressed\n\n2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:37.280\n in cognitive science and psychology,\n\n2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:39.800\n in mathematics, in physics,\n\n2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:42.840\n in just whatever you want to, economics even.\n\n2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:44.680\n But if you look into that literature,\n\n2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:47.600\n you might be able to discover some beautiful ideas.\n\n2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:51.160\n Obviously Russian is an interesting case of that.\n\n2:35:51.160 --> 2:35:53.480\n It's because there's a loss in translation,\n\n2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:57.400\n but you said there's a source of fuel, a source of energy.\n\n2:35:57.400 --> 2:35:58.240\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:00.960\n So the BZ reaction, you have an acid in there\n\n2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:02.480\n called malonic acid.\n\n2:36:02.480 --> 2:36:07.280\n And what happens is it's basically like a battery\n\n2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:09.600\n that powers it and it loses CO2.\n\n2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:12.000\n So decarboxylates, it's just a chemical reaction.\n\n2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.440\n What that means we have to do is continuously feed\n\n2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:16.520\n or we just keep the BZ reaction going\n\n2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:18.120\n in a long enough time.\n\n2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:21.080\n So it's like it's reversible in time.\n\n2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:23.960\n But only like, yeah.\n\n2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:26.360\n But only like, but it's fascinating.\n\n2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:27.640\n I mean, the team that did it,\n\n2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:29.640\n I'm really proud of their persistence.\n\n2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:33.840\n We made a chemical computer and it can solve\n\n2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:34.680\n little problems.\n\n2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:36.320\n It can solve traveling salesman problems actually.\n\n2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:37.760\n Nice.\n\n2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:38.600\n But like I say, it's.\n\n2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:41.000\n But not any faster than a regular computer.\n\n2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.120\n Is there something you can do?\n\n2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:45.040\n Maybe, I'm not sure.\n\n2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:49.720\n I think we can come up with a way of solving problems,\n\n2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:52.080\n also really complex, hard ones,\n\n2:36:54.160 --> 2:36:56.200\n because it's an analog computer and we can,\n\n2:36:56.200 --> 2:36:59.640\n it can energy minimize really quickly.\n\n2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:01.360\n It doesn't have to basically go through every element\n\n2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:05.440\n in the matrix, like flip it, it just reads out.\n\n2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:07.920\n So we could actually do Monte Carlo\n\n2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:10.640\n by just shaking the box.\n\n2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:12.080\n It's literally a box shaker.\n\n2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:14.920\n You don't actually have to encode the shaking of the box\n\n2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:17.480\n in a silicon memory and then just shuffle everything around.\n\n2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:18.320\n Yeah, and you can.\n\n2:37:18.320 --> 2:37:19.680\n It's analog, it's natural.\n\n2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:23.440\n So it's an organic computer.\n\n2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:24.280\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:25.920\n So I was playing around with this\n\n2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:27.480\n and I was kind of annoying some of my colleagues\n\n2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:29.840\n and wondering if we could get to chemical supremacy\n\n2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:31.480\n like quantum supremacy.\n\n2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:36.000\n And I kind of calculated how big the grid has to be\n\n2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.280\n so we can actually start to solve problems faster\n\n2:37:38.280 --> 2:37:40.040\n than a silicon computer.\n\n2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:43.320\n But I'm not willing to state how that is yet\n\n2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:44.760\n because I'm probably wrong.\n\n2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:46.960\n It's not that it's any top secret thing\n\n2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:49.440\n is I want, I think I can make a chemical computer\n\n2:37:49.440 --> 2:37:51.840\n that can solve optimization problems faster\n\n2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:53.200\n than the silicon computer.\n\n2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:55.560\n That's fascinating.\n\n2:37:55.560 --> 2:37:57.840\n But then you're unsure how big that has to be.\n\n2:37:57.840 --> 2:37:58.680\n Yeah, I think, I mean.\n\n2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:00.760\n It might be a big box, hard to shake.\n\n2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:03.000\n It might be exactly a big box, hard to shake\n\n2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.120\n and basically a bit sloppy.\n\n2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:08.160\n Did we answer the question about\n\n2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:11.240\n do cellular atomic exists outside the mind?\n\n2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:14.560\n We didn't, but I would posit that they don't.\n\n2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:17.720\n And I, but I think minds can, well.\n\n2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:19.600\n So the mind is fundamental.\n\n2:38:19.600 --> 2:38:21.280\n What's the, why?\n\n2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:23.200\n Well, I mean, sorry, let's go back.\n\n2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:26.280\n So as a physical phenomena, do CAs exist\n\n2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:28.520\n in physical reality, right?\n\n2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:30.840\n I would say they probably don't exist\n\n2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:33.000\n outside the human mind, but now we've constructed them.\n\n2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.720\n They exist in computer memories.\n\n2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:35.760\n They exist in my lab.\n\n2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:37.000\n They exist on paper.\n\n2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:40.720\n So they are, they emerge from the human mind.\n\n2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:43.920\n I'm just interested in, because Stephen Wolfram likes CAs,\n\n2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:46.360\n a lot of people like CAs and likes to think of them\n\n2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:49.400\n as minimal computational elements.\n\n2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:52.040\n I'm just saying, well, do they exist in reality\n\n2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:54.320\n or are they a representation of a simple machine\n\n2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:56.160\n that's just very elegant to implement?\n\n2:38:57.560 --> 2:38:59.240\n So it's a platonic question, I guess.\n\n2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:03.160\n I mean, it's, there's initial conditions.\n\n2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:05.320\n There's a memory in the system.\n\n2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:07.360\n There are simple rules that dictate\n\n2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:09.080\n the evolution of the system.\n\n2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:10.960\n So what exists?\n\n2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:12.800\n The idea, the rules, the.\n\n2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:15.360\n Yeah, people are using CAs as models\n\n2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:18.640\n for things in reality to say, hey, look,\n\n2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:21.640\n you can do this thing in a CA.\n\n2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:24.520\n And my, when I see this, I'm saying, oh, that's cool.\n\n2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:26.080\n But what does that tell me about reality?\n\n2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:27.560\n Where's the CA in space?\n\n2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:28.400\n Oh, I see.\n\n2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:29.240\n Well, right.\n\n2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:30.520\n It's a mathematical object.\n\n2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:33.000\n So for people who don't know cellular automata,\n\n2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:35.560\n there's usually a grid, whether it's one dimensional,\n\n2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:36.960\n two dimensional, or three dimensional.\n\n2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:39.400\n And it evolves by simple local rules,\n\n2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:44.400\n like you die or are born if the neighbors are alive or dead.\n\n2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:46.760\n And it turns out if you have,\n\n2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:51.760\n with certain kinds of initial conditions\n\n2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:53.440\n and with certain kinds of very simple rules,\n\n2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:56.720\n you can create like arbitrarily complex\n\n2:39:56.720 --> 2:39:57.680\n and beautiful systems.\n\n2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:02.680\n And to me, whether drugs are involved or not,\n\n2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:08.760\n I can sit back for hours and enjoy the mystery of it,\n\n2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:14.600\n how such complexity can emerge as it gives me almost like,\n\n2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:17.360\n you know, people talk about religious experiences.\n\n2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:22.360\n It gives me a sense that you get to have a glimpse\n\n2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:26.880\n at the origin of this whole thing.\n\n2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:31.880\n Whatever is creating this complexity from such simplicity\n\n2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:38.080\n is the very thing that brought my mind to life,\n\n2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:42.960\n this me, the human, our human civilization.\n\n2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:47.960\n And yes, those constructs are pretty trivial.\n\n2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:50.760\n I mean, that's part of their magic\n\n2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:54.320\n is even in this trivial framework,\n\n2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:56.520\n you could see the emergence,\n\n2:40:56.520 --> 2:40:58.840\n or especially in this trivial framework,\n\n2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:01.840\n you could see the emergence of complexity from simplicity.\n\n2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:05.920\n I guess what Lee, you're saying is that this is not,\n\n2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:10.920\n you know, this is highly unlike systems\n\n2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:13.040\n we see in the physical world,\n\n2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:17.280\n even though they probably carry some of the same magic,\n\n2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:19.240\n like mechanistically, that's all.\n\n2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:22.360\n I mean, I'm saying that the operating system\n\n2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:26.080\n that a CA has to exist on is quite complex.\n\n2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:28.880\n And so I wonder if you're getting the complexity\n\n2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:30.480\n out of the CA from the boundary conditions\n\n2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:33.520\n of the operating system, the underlying digital computer.\n\n2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:36.800\n Oh, wow, those are some strong words against CAs then.\n\n2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:37.720\n I didn't realize. Not against.\n\n2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:40.640\n I mean, I'm in love with CAs as well.\n\n2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:44.520\n I'm just saying they aren't as trivial as people think.\n\n2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:45.880\n They are incredible.\n\n2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:47.200\n To get to that richness,\n\n2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:51.000\n you have to iterate billions of times,\n\n2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:54.960\n and you need a display, and you need a math coprocessor,\n\n2:41:54.960 --> 2:41:57.720\n and you need a von Neumann machine\n\n2:41:57.720 --> 2:41:59.040\n based on a Turing machine\n\n2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:01.600\n of digital error correction and states.\n\n2:42:01.600 --> 2:42:05.800\n Wow, to think that for the simplicity of a grid,\n\n2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:08.840\n you're basically saying a grid is not simple.\n\n2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:09.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:12.800\n It requires incredible complexity to bring a grid to life.\n\n2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:13.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:16.120\n Yeah, that's it.\n\n2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:17.400\n Well, then what is simple?\n\n2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:18.440\n That's all I wanted to say.\n\n2:42:18.440 --> 2:42:20.480\n I agree with you with the wonder of CAs, I just think.\n\n2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:22.960\n But remember, we take so much for granted\n\n2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:24.800\n what the CA is resting on.\n\n2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:28.360\n Because von Neumann and Feynman weren't showing,\n\n2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:30.000\n weren't seeing these elaborate structures.\n\n2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:31.440\n They could not get that far.\n\n2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:34.960\n Yeah, but that's the limitation of their mind.\n\n2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:35.800\n Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:37.440\n The limitation of their pencil.\n\n2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:40.680\n But I think the question is\n\n2:42:40.680 --> 2:42:44.200\n whether the essential elements of the cellular automata\n\n2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:50.880\n is present without all the complexities\n\n2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:52.440\n required to build a computer.\n\n2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:56.080\n And my intuition, the reason I find it incredible\n\n2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:58.320\n is that, yeah, my intuition is yes.\n\n2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:00.840\n It might look different.\n\n2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:05.120\n There might not be a grid like structure,\n\n2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:09.720\n but local interactions operating under simple rules\n\n2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:14.560\n and resulting in multi hierarchical complex structures\n\n2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:17.920\n feels like a thing that doesn't require a computer.\n\n2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:21.000\n I agree, but coming back to von Neumann and Feynman\n\n2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:24.840\n and Wolfram, their minds, the non trivial minds\n\n2:43:24.840 --> 2:43:26.560\n to create those architectures and do it\n\n2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:30.720\n and to put on those state transitions.\n\n2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:32.080\n And I think that's something\n\n2:43:32.080 --> 2:43:34.520\n that's really incredibly interesting\n\n2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:38.080\n that is understanding how the human mind\n\n2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:40.720\n builds those state transition machines.\n\n2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:43.360\n I could see how deeply in love\n\n2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:45.040\n with the idea of memory you are.\n\n2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:49.680\n So it's like how much of E equals MC squared\n\n2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:53.840\n is more than an equation.\n\n2:43:53.840 --> 2:43:56.480\n It has Albert Einstein in it.\n\n2:43:57.680 --> 2:44:00.400\n You're saying you can't just say this is a,\n\n2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:05.400\n like the equations of physics are a really good\n\n2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:10.080\n simple capture of a physical phenomenon.\n\n2:44:10.080 --> 2:44:15.000\n It is also, that equation has the memory of the humans.\n\n2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.680\n Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.\n\n2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:21.440\n But I don't, I don't know if you're implying this.\n\n2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:25.080\n I don't, that's a beautiful idea,\n\n2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:27.120\n but I don't know if I'm comfortable\n\n2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:31.040\n with that sort of diminishing the power of that equation.\n\n2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:31.880\n No, no, it enhances it.\n\n2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:33.600\n Because it's built on the shoulders, it enhances it.\n\n2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:35.200\n I think it enhances it, it's not,\n\n2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:38.080\n that equation is a minimal compressed representation\n\n2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:39.360\n of reality, right?\n\n2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:43.440\n We can use machine learning or Max Tegmark's AI Feynman\n\n2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:45.080\n to find lots of solutions for gravity,\n\n2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:47.320\n but isn't it wonderful that the laws that we do find\n\n2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:49.600\n are the maximally compressed representations?\n\n2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:54.520\n Yeah, but that representation, you can now give it as,\n\n2:44:54.520 --> 2:44:56.600\n I guess the universe has the memory of Einstein\n\n2:44:56.600 --> 2:44:58.320\n with that representation.\n\n2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:00.880\n But then you can now give it as a gift for free.\n\n2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:01.720\n Yeah, yeah, it's low memory.\n\n2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:02.960\n To other alien civilizations.\n\n2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:03.800\n Einstein had to go through a lot of pain to get there,\n\n2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:04.880\n but it's low memory.\n\n2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:07.280\n So, I say that physics and chemistry and biology\n\n2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:08.720\n are the same discipline.\n\n2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:11.760\n They're just physics, laws in physics.\n\n2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:13.320\n There's no such thing as a law in physics.\n\n2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:15.560\n It's just low memory stuff.\n\n2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:16.920\n Because you've got low memory stuff,\n\n2:45:16.920 --> 2:45:19.800\n you can, things reoccur quickly.\n\n2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:21.280\n As you can get, build in more memory,\n\n2:45:21.280 --> 2:45:24.000\n you get to chemistry, so things become more contingent.\n\n2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:26.160\n When you get to biology, more contingent still,\n\n2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:27.400\n and then technology.\n\n2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:28.800\n So, the more memory you need,\n\n2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:31.480\n the more your laws are local.\n\n2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:32.640\n That's all I'm saying.\n\n2:45:32.640 --> 2:45:35.480\n And the less memory, the more the laws are universal,\n\n2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:36.320\n because they're not laws.\n\n2:45:36.320 --> 2:45:37.920\n They are just low memory states.\n\n2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:44.040\n We have to talk about a thing you've kind of mentioned\n\n2:45:44.040 --> 2:45:45.360\n already a bunch of times,\n\n2:45:45.360 --> 2:45:49.640\n but doing computation through chemistry,\n\n2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:51.840\n chemical based computation.\n\n2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:56.840\n I've seen you refer to it as in a sexy title\n\n2:45:56.840 --> 2:46:00.920\n of Kemputation, Kemputation.\n\n2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:02.640\n So, what is computation?\n\n2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:06.200\n What is chemical based computation?\n\n2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:09.680\n Okay, so Kemputation is a name I gave\n\n2:46:09.680 --> 2:46:12.960\n to the process of building a state machine\n\n2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:15.880\n to make any molecule physically in the lab.\n\n2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:19.440\n And so, as a chemist, chemists make molecules by hand.\n\n2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:22.880\n And they're quite hard.\n\n2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:25.280\n The chemists have a lot of tacit knowledge,\n\n2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:26.840\n a lot of ambiguity.\n\n2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:29.720\n It's not possible to go uniformly to the literature\n\n2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:32.440\n and read a recipe to make a molecule,\n\n2:46:32.440 --> 2:46:35.400\n and then go and make it in the lab every time.\n\n2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:37.440\n Some recipes are better than others,\n\n2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:42.440\n but they all assume some knowledge.\n\n2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:44.880\n And it's not universal what that is.\n\n2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:49.640\n Like, so it's carried from human to human.\n\n2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:51.120\n Some of that implicit knowledge.\n\n2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:52.600\n And you're saying, can we remove the human\n\n2:46:52.600 --> 2:46:53.440\n from the patient?\n\n2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:55.160\n Can we like a program?\n\n2:46:55.160 --> 2:46:57.520\n Okay, well, by the way, what is a state machine?\n\n2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:01.840\n So a state machine is a, I suppose,\n\n2:47:01.840 --> 2:47:05.760\n a object either abstract or mechanical\n\n2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:10.560\n where you can do a unit operation on it\n\n2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:12.280\n and flick it from one state to another.\n\n2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:15.960\n So a turnstile would be a good example of a state machine.\n\n2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:17.400\n There's some kinds of states\n\n2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:19.680\n and some kind of transitions between states.\n\n2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:23.640\n And it's very formal in nature\n\n2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:25.040\n in terms of like it's precise,\n\n2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:25.880\n how you're doing those transitions.\n\n2:47:25.880 --> 2:47:28.120\n Yes, you can mathematically precisely\n\n2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:29.440\n describe a state machine.\n\n2:47:29.440 --> 2:47:33.160\n So, I mean, a very simple Boolean gates\n\n2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:35.440\n are a very good way of building\n\n2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:37.480\n kind of logic based state machines.\n\n2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:39.920\n Obviously a Turing machine,\n\n2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:41.440\n the concept of a Turing machine\n\n2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:43.520\n where you have a tape and a read head\n\n2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:46.200\n and a series of rules in a table\n\n2:47:46.200 --> 2:47:49.400\n and you would basically look at what's on the tape.\n\n2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:51.600\n And if you're shifting the tape from left to right,\n\n2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:53.480\n and if you see a zero or one,\n\n2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:54.960\n you look in your lookup table and say,\n\n2:47:54.960 --> 2:47:57.440\n right, I've seen a zero and a one.\n\n2:47:57.440 --> 2:48:01.680\n I then do, I then respond to that.\n\n2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:03.720\n So in the turnstile would be,\n\n2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:06.680\n is there a human being pushing the turnstile\n\n2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:09.280\n in direction clockwise?\n\n2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:11.360\n If yes, I will open, let them go.\n\n2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:12.960\n If it's anticlockwise, no.\n\n2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:15.120\n So yeah, so a state machine has some labels\n\n2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:17.920\n and a transition diagram.\n\n2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:22.120\n So you're looking to come up with a chemical computer\n\n2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:25.560\n to form state machines to create molecules,\n\n2:48:25.560 --> 2:48:29.320\n or what's the chicken and the egg?\n\n2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:31.480\n So computation is not a chemical computer\n\n2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:32.360\n because we talked a few moments\n\n2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:35.280\n about actually doing computations with chemicals.\n\n2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:37.520\n What I'm now saying is I want to use state machines\n\n2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:39.680\n to transform chemicals.\n\n2:48:39.680 --> 2:48:42.680\n And so build chemicals programmatically.\n\n2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:44.480\n Yeah, I mean, I get in trouble saying this.\n\n2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:47.000\n I said to my group, oh, I shouldn't say it\n\n2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.600\n because it's, but I said, look, we should make the crack bot.\n\n2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:51.200\n Is it in the crack robot?\n\n2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:52.040\n The robot that makes crack.\n\n2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:52.880\n The crack bot?\n\n2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:55.240\n Oh, oh, oh, oh, crack bot.\n\n2:48:55.240 --> 2:48:56.440\n The robot that makes crack,\n\n2:48:56.440 --> 2:48:59.040\n but maybe we should scrub this from, but.\n\n2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:03.120\n Or, well, so maybe you can educate me\n\n2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:06.160\n on breaking bad with like math, right?\n\n2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:07.600\n Yeah, so in breaking bad.\n\n2:49:07.600 --> 2:49:12.080\n You want to make basically some kind of mix\n\n2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:15.400\n of ex machina and breaking bad.\n\n2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:16.240\n No, I don't.\n\n2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:17.080\n I don't.\n\n2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:17.920\n For the record, I don't, but I said.\n\n2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:18.760\n No, you don't.\n\n2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:19.880\n I said, that's what I'm going to do\n\n2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:21.520\n once you release the papers.\n\n2:49:23.880 --> 2:49:28.880\n I shaved my head and I'm going to live a life of crime.\n\n2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:29.760\n Anyway, I'm sorry.\n\n2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:30.600\n No, no.\n\n2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:33.280\n So yeah, let's get back to, so indeed,\n\n2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:35.320\n it is about making drugs, but importantly,\n\n2:49:35.320 --> 2:49:38.320\n making important drugs, so let's.\n\n2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:39.840\n All drugs matter.\n\n2:49:39.840 --> 2:49:41.480\n Yeah, but let's go back.\n\n2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:46.040\n So the basic thesis is chemistry is very analog.\n\n2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:47.400\n There is no state machine.\n\n2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:52.800\n And I wandered into the, through the paper walls\n\n2:49:52.800 --> 2:49:55.000\n in the Japanese house a few years ago and said,\n\n2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:58.120\n okay, hey, organic chemist, why are you doing this analog?\n\n2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:00.400\n They said, well, chemistry is really hard.\n\n2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:03.320\n You can't automate it, it's impossible.\n\n2:50:03.320 --> 2:50:05.360\n I said, but is it impossible?\n\n2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:06.200\n They said, yeah.\n\n2:50:06.200 --> 2:50:07.680\n And they said, you know, I got the impression\n\n2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:09.560\n they were saying it's magic.\n\n2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:11.720\n And so when people tell me things are magic,\n\n2:50:12.800 --> 2:50:14.120\n it's like, no, no, they can't be magic.\n\n2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:15.680\n Right, so let's break this down.\n\n2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:19.560\n And so what I did is I went to my group one day\n\n2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:21.680\n about eight years ago and said, hey guys,\n\n2:50:21.680 --> 2:50:24.400\n I've written this new programming language for you.\n\n2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:26.680\n And so everything is clear.\n\n2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:28.480\n And you know, you have to, you're not allowed to\n\n2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:30.080\n just wander around the lab willy nilly.\n\n2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:31.480\n You have to pick up things in order,\n\n2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:34.280\n go to the balance of the right time and all this stuff.\n\n2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:36.000\n And they looked at me as if I was insane\n\n2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:37.480\n and basically kicked me out of the lab and said,\n\n2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:39.560\n no, don't do that, we're not doing that.\n\n2:50:39.560 --> 2:50:40.400\n And I said, okay.\n\n2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:42.120\n So I went back the next day and said,\n\n2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:45.760\n I'm gonna find some money so we can make cool robots\n\n2:50:45.760 --> 2:50:46.800\n do chemical reactions.\n\n2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:48.920\n And everyone went, that's cool.\n\n2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:50.720\n And so in that process.\n\n2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:54.160\n The first we tried to convert the humans to become robots\n\n2:50:54.160 --> 2:50:57.320\n and next you agree you might as well just create the robots.\n\n2:50:57.320 --> 2:51:00.160\n Yes, but so in that, the formalization process.\n\n2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:02.640\n Yeah, so what I did is I said, look, chemical,\n\n2:51:02.640 --> 2:51:04.960\n to make a molecule, you need to do four things abstractly.\n\n2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:07.040\n I want to make a chemical Turing machine.\n\n2:51:07.040 --> 2:51:08.800\n Cause a Turing machine, you think about this,\n\n2:51:08.800 --> 2:51:10.080\n imagine a Turing machine.\n\n2:51:10.080 --> 2:51:14.600\n Turing machine is the ultimate abstraction of a computation\n\n2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:17.960\n because it's been shown by Turing and others\n\n2:51:17.960 --> 2:51:19.960\n that basically a universal Turing machine\n\n2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:23.080\n should be able to do all computations that you can imagine.\n\n2:51:23.080 --> 2:51:25.680\n It's like, wow, why don't I think of a Turing machine\n\n2:51:25.680 --> 2:51:26.520\n for chemistry?\n\n2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:29.760\n Let's think of a magic robot that can make any molecule.\n\n2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:31.560\n Let's think about that for a second.\n\n2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:32.480\n Okay, great.\n\n2:51:32.480 --> 2:51:33.560\n How do we then implement it?\n\n2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:34.400\n And I think it's right.\n\n2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:35.760\n So what is the abstraction?\n\n2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:39.280\n So to make any molecule, you have to do a reaction.\n\n2:51:39.280 --> 2:51:41.480\n So you have to put reagents together, do a reaction\n\n2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:43.880\n in a flask typically.\n\n2:51:43.880 --> 2:51:44.960\n Then you're after the reaction,\n\n2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:45.960\n you have to stop the reactions.\n\n2:51:45.960 --> 2:51:47.400\n You do what's called a workup.\n\n2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:51.600\n So whatever, cool it down, add some liquid to it, extract.\n\n2:51:51.600 --> 2:51:53.560\n So then after you do the workup, you separate.\n\n2:51:53.560 --> 2:51:55.920\n So you then remove the molecules, separate them all out.\n\n2:51:55.920 --> 2:51:58.160\n And then the final step is purification.\n\n2:51:58.160 --> 2:52:01.720\n So reaction, workup, separate, purify.\n\n2:52:01.720 --> 2:52:05.880\n So this is basically exactly like a Turing machine\n\n2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:08.280\n where you have your tape, you have your tape head,\n\n2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:10.360\n you have some rules, and then you run it.\n\n2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:11.760\n So I thought, cool.\n\n2:52:11.760 --> 2:52:13.240\n I went to all the chemists and said, look,\n\n2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:15.320\n chemistry isn't that hard.\n\n2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:18.360\n Reaction, workup, separation, purification.\n\n2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:20.960\n Do that in cycles, forever, for any molecule,\n\n2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:23.160\n all the chemistry, done.\n\n2:52:23.160 --> 2:52:26.200\n And they said, chemistry is that hard.\n\n2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:28.240\n I said, but just in principle.\n\n2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:30.520\n And I got a few very enlightened people to say,\n\n2:52:30.520 --> 2:52:33.160\n yeah, okay, in principle, but it ain't gonna work.\n\n2:52:33.160 --> 2:52:36.600\n And this was in about 2013, 2014.\n\n2:52:36.600 --> 2:52:39.840\n And I found myself going to an architecture conference\n\n2:52:39.840 --> 2:52:40.840\n almost by accident.\n\n2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:42.720\n It's like, why am I at this random conference\n\n2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:44.400\n on architecture?\n\n2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:45.920\n And that was because I published a paper\n\n2:52:45.920 --> 2:52:47.840\n on inorganic architecture.\n\n2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:49.440\n And they said, come to architecture conference.\n\n2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:51.720\n But the inorganic architecture is nano architecture.\n\n2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:53.160\n It's not, and I went, okay.\n\n2:52:53.160 --> 2:52:54.880\n And then I found these guys at the conference,\n\n2:52:54.880 --> 2:52:57.400\n 3D printing ping pong balls and shapes.\n\n2:52:57.400 --> 2:52:58.240\n And this is through it.\n\n2:52:58.240 --> 2:52:59.080\n 3D printing was cool.\n\n2:52:59.080 --> 2:53:00.440\n And I was like, this is ridiculous.\n\n2:53:00.440 --> 2:53:01.880\n Why are you 3D printing ping pong balls?\n\n2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:03.400\n And I gave them a whole load of abuse\n\n2:53:03.400 --> 2:53:05.320\n like I normally do when I first meet people,\n\n2:53:05.320 --> 2:53:07.240\n how to win friends and influence people.\n\n2:53:07.240 --> 2:53:10.240\n And then I was like, oh my God, you guys are geniuses.\n\n2:53:10.240 --> 2:53:12.000\n And so I got from, they were a bit confused\n\n2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:13.080\n because I was calling them idiots\n\n2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:14.120\n and then call them geniuses.\n\n2:53:14.120 --> 2:53:16.120\n It's like, will you come to my lab\n\n2:53:16.120 --> 2:53:18.240\n and we're gonna build a robot to do chemistry\n\n2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:19.080\n with a 3D printer.\n\n2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:20.960\n And I said, oh, that's cool, all right.\n\n2:53:20.960 --> 2:53:22.320\n So I had them come to the lab\n\n2:53:22.320 --> 2:53:24.000\n and we started to 3D print test tubes.\n\n2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:26.760\n So you imagine, you know, 3D print a bottle\n\n2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:30.560\n and then use the same gantry to basically,\n\n2:53:30.560 --> 2:53:34.160\n rather than to squirt out a plastic out of a nozzle,\n\n2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:36.400\n have a little syringe and jet chemicals in.\n\n2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:38.720\n So we had the 3D printer that could simultaneously\n\n2:53:38.720 --> 2:53:40.560\n print the test tube and then put chemicals\n\n2:53:40.560 --> 2:53:42.080\n into the test tube.\n\n2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:42.920\n And then.\n\n2:53:42.920 --> 2:53:44.480\n Wow, so it's really end to end.\n\n2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:45.600\n Yeah, I was like, that would be cool\n\n2:53:45.600 --> 2:53:47.080\n because they've got G code to do it all.\n\n2:53:47.080 --> 2:53:48.760\n And I was like, that's cool.\n\n2:53:48.760 --> 2:53:50.800\n So I got my group doing this and I developed it a bit\n\n2:53:50.800 --> 2:53:54.600\n and I realized that we could take those unit operations.\n\n2:53:54.600 --> 2:53:57.160\n And we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves.\n\n2:53:57.160 --> 2:54:00.840\n And I realized that I could basically take the literature\n\n2:54:00.840 --> 2:54:05.840\n and I made the first version of the computer in 2016, 17.\n\n2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:07.520\n I made some architectural decisions.\n\n2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:09.400\n So I designed the pumps and valves in my group.\n\n2:54:09.400 --> 2:54:10.760\n I did all the electronics in my group.\n\n2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:12.320\n They were brilliant.\n\n2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:15.880\n I cannot pay tribute to my group enough in doing this.\n\n2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:16.720\n They were just brilliant.\n\n2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:18.400\n And there were some poor souls there that said,\n\n2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:21.320\n Lee, why are you making us design electronics?\n\n2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:24.280\n I'm like, well, because I don't understand it.\n\n2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:26.040\n They're like, so you're making us design stuff\n\n2:54:26.040 --> 2:54:26.880\n because you don't understand.\n\n2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:29.680\n It's like, yeah, it's like, but can we not just buy some?\n\n2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:31.560\n I said, well, we can, but then I don't understand\n\n2:54:31.560 --> 2:54:34.520\n how to, you know, what bus they're gonna use\n\n2:54:34.520 --> 2:54:36.040\n and there's serial ports and all this stuff.\n\n2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:39.040\n I just wanted, and I made, I came up with a decision\n\n2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:41.120\n to design a bunch of pumps and valves\n\n2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:42.600\n and use power of the ethernet.\n\n2:54:42.600 --> 2:54:45.360\n So they've got one cable for power and data,\n\n2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:48.080\n plug them all in, plug them all into a router\n\n2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:51.360\n and then I made the state machine.\n\n2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:53.680\n And there was a couple of cool things I did.\n\n2:54:53.680 --> 2:54:54.880\n Oh, they did actually.\n\n2:54:55.760 --> 2:54:57.160\n We got the abstraction.\n\n2:54:57.160 --> 2:55:01.580\n So reaction, workup, separation, purification.\n\n2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:06.080\n And then I made the decision to do it in batch.\n\n2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:07.880\n Now it's in batch.\n\n2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:10.640\n All chemistry had been digitized before apparently,\n\n2:55:10.640 --> 2:55:13.960\n and once it's been done, but everyone been doing it in flow\n\n2:55:13.960 --> 2:55:16.240\n and flow is continuous and there are infinities everywhere\n\n2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:19.040\n and you have to just, and I realized\n\n2:55:19.040 --> 2:55:20.640\n that I could actually make a state machine\n\n2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:23.860\n where I basically put stuff in the reactor,\n\n2:55:24.860 --> 2:55:26.900\n turn it up from one state to another state,\n\n2:55:26.900 --> 2:55:28.380\n stop it and just read it out.\n\n2:55:28.380 --> 2:55:30.680\n And okay, and I was kind of bitching\n\n2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:32.360\n at electrical engineers saying, you have it easy.\n\n2:55:32.360 --> 2:55:34.760\n You don't have to clean out the electrons, you know.\n\n2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:36.380\n Electrons don't leave a big mess.\n\n2:55:36.380 --> 2:55:37.900\n They leave some EM waste.\n\n2:55:37.900 --> 2:55:39.760\n But in my state machine I built in cleaning.\n\n2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:41.600\n So it's like, we do all the operation\n\n2:55:41.600 --> 2:55:43.320\n and then it cleans the backbone and then can do it again.\n\n2:55:43.320 --> 2:55:46.020\n So there's no, so what we managed to do\n\n2:55:46.020 --> 2:55:49.280\n over a couple of years is develop the hardware,\n\n2:55:49.280 --> 2:55:50.720\n develop the state machine.\n\n2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:52.140\n And we encoded three molecules.\n\n2:55:52.140 --> 2:55:54.120\n We did three, the first three, we did nitole,\n\n2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:57.160\n a sleeping drug, rafinamide, antiseizure and Viagra.\n\n2:55:57.160 --> 2:55:59.560\n You know, and I could make jokes on the paper.\n\n2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:02.120\n It's a hard problem, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:56:02.120 --> 2:56:04.320\n That's very good.\n\n2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:06.440\n And then in the next one, what we did is said, okay,\n\n2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:09.520\n my poor organic chemist said, look, Lee,\n\n2:56:09.520 --> 2:56:11.220\n we've worked with you this long.\n\n2:56:11.220 --> 2:56:12.880\n We've made a robot that looks like\n\n2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:14.660\n it's gonna take our jobs away.\n\n2:56:14.660 --> 2:56:19.040\n And not just take our jobs away, what we love in the lab,\n\n2:56:19.040 --> 2:56:20.800\n but now we have to become programmers.\n\n2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:22.000\n But we're not even good programmers.\n\n2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:25.060\n We just have to spend ages writing lines of code\n\n2:56:25.060 --> 2:56:27.440\n that are boring and it's not as elegant.\n\n2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:28.840\n I went, you're right.\n\n2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:32.720\n So then, but I knew because I had this abstraction\n\n2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:34.960\n and I knew that there was language,\n\n2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:36.520\n I could suddenly develop a state machine\n\n2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:37.680\n that would interpret the language,\n\n2:56:37.680 --> 2:56:42.080\n which was lossy and ambiguous and populate my abstraction.\n\n2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:44.320\n So I built a chemical programming language\n\n2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:46.960\n that is actually gonna be recursively enumerable.\n\n2:56:46.960 --> 2:56:48.580\n It's gonna be a Turing complete language actually,\n\n2:56:48.580 --> 2:56:51.500\n which is kind of cool, which means it's formally verifiable.\n\n2:56:51.500 --> 2:56:55.280\n So where we are now is we can now read the literature\n\n2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:56.880\n using a bit of natural language processing.\n\n2:56:56.880 --> 2:56:57.720\n It's not the best.\n\n2:56:57.720 --> 2:56:59.520\n There are many other groups have done a better job,\n\n2:56:59.520 --> 2:57:01.240\n but we can use that language reading\n\n2:57:01.240 --> 2:57:05.860\n to populate the state machine and basically add, subtract.\n\n2:57:05.860 --> 2:57:09.440\n We got about a number of primitives that we,\n\n2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:14.320\n basically program loops that we dovetail together\n\n2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:15.780\n and we can make any molecule with it.\n\n2:57:15.780 --> 2:57:18.240\n Okay, so that's the kind of program synthesis.\n\n2:57:18.240 --> 2:57:19.920\n So you start at like literally,\n\n2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:21.800\n you're talking about like a paper,\n\n2:57:21.800 --> 2:57:25.400\n like a scientific paper that's being read.\n\n2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:26.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:27.080\n So natural language processing,\n\n2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:32.080\n extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions\n\n2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:38.320\n and the chemical molecules and compounds involved.\n\n2:57:38.320 --> 2:57:43.320\n And then that, in GPT terms,\n\n2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:47.600\n serves as a prompt for the program synthesis\n\n2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:49.280\n that's kind of trivial right now.\n\n2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:51.240\n There you have a bunch of different like for loops\n\n2:57:51.240 --> 2:57:56.080\n and so on that creates a program in this chemical language\n\n2:57:56.080 --> 2:58:00.160\n that can then be interpreted by the chemical computer,\n\n2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:01.720\n the computer.\n\n2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:03.280\n Yeah, computer, that's the word.\n\n2:58:03.280 --> 2:58:04.120\n Computer, yeah.\n\n2:58:05.600 --> 2:58:07.840\n Everything sounds better in your British accent,\n\n2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:09.280\n but it's, I love it.\n\n2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:12.080\n So the, into the computer and that's able to then\n\n2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:17.120\n basically be a 3D printer for these, for molecules.\n\n2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:18.440\n Yeah, I wouldn't call it a 3D printer.\n\n2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:21.040\n I would call it a universal chemical reaction system\n\n2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:23.460\n because 3D printing gives the wrong impression, but yeah.\n\n2:58:23.460 --> 2:58:25.200\n And it purifies.\n\n2:58:25.200 --> 2:58:28.680\n And the nice thing is that that code now that we call it,\n\n2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:33.680\n the KyDL code is really interesting because now,\n\n2:58:34.520 --> 2:58:36.240\n so computation, what is computation?\n\n2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:41.240\n Computation is what computing is to mathematics, I think.\n\n2:58:41.320 --> 2:58:44.680\n Computation is the process of taking chemical code\n\n2:58:44.680 --> 2:58:47.800\n and some input reagents and making the same molecule,\n\n2:58:47.800 --> 2:58:52.160\n making the molecule reproducibly every time without fail.\n\n2:58:52.160 --> 2:58:53.320\n What is computation?\n\n2:58:53.320 --> 2:58:55.520\n It's the process of using a program\n\n2:58:55.520 --> 2:58:57.720\n to take some input conditions\n\n2:58:57.720 --> 2:59:02.220\n and give you an output same every time, right, reliably.\n\n2:59:02.220 --> 2:59:05.640\n So the problem is, now maybe you can push back\n\n2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:07.480\n and correct me on this.\n\n2:59:07.480 --> 2:59:09.940\n So I know biology is messy.\n\n2:59:09.940 --> 2:59:12.380\n My question is how messy is chemistry?\n\n2:59:12.380 --> 2:59:15.640\n So the, if we use the analogy of a computer,\n\n2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:20.640\n it's easier to make computation in a computer very precise,\n\n2:59:21.920 --> 2:59:26.200\n that it's repeatable and makes errors almost never.\n\n2:59:26.200 --> 2:59:28.440\n If it does the exact same way over and over\n\n2:59:28.440 --> 2:59:29.520\n and over and over.\n\n2:59:29.520 --> 2:59:30.560\n What about chemistry?\n\n2:59:30.560 --> 2:59:32.680\n Is there messiness in the whole thing?\n\n2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:33.920\n Can that be somehow leveraged?\n\n2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:34.760\n Can that be controlled?\n\n2:59:34.760 --> 2:59:36.200\n Can it be that removed,\n\n2:59:36.200 --> 2:59:38.280\n do we wanna remove it from the system?\n\n2:59:38.280 --> 2:59:39.680\n Oh, yes and no, right.\n\n2:59:39.680 --> 2:59:40.640\n Is there messiness?\n\n2:59:42.680 --> 2:59:45.000\n There is messiness because chemistry is like,\n\n2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:49.240\n you're doing reactions on billions of molecules\n\n2:59:49.240 --> 2:59:50.200\n and they don't always work,\n\n2:59:50.200 --> 2:59:52.100\n but you've got purification there.\n\n2:59:52.100 --> 2:59:54.480\n And so what we found is at the beginning,\n\n2:59:54.480 --> 2:59:55.940\n everyone said it can't work.\n\n2:59:55.940 --> 2:59:56.840\n It's gonna be too messy.\n\n2:59:56.840 --> 2:59:58.040\n It will just fail.\n\n2:59:58.040 --> 3:00:00.000\n And I said, but you managed to get chemistry\n\n3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:00.840\n to work in the lab.\n\n3:00:00.840 --> 3:00:01.660\n Are you magic?\n\n3:00:01.660 --> 3:00:02.640\n Are you doing something?\n\n3:00:02.640 --> 3:00:05.920\n So I would say, now go back to the first ever computer\n\n3:00:05.920 --> 3:00:09.480\n or the ENIAC, 5 million soldered joints,\n\n3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:12.760\n 400,000 valves that are exploding all the time.\n\n3:00:12.760 --> 3:00:16.360\n Was that, would you have gone, okay, that's messy.\n\n3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:17.200\n So we've got the,\n\n3:00:18.520 --> 3:00:21.060\n have we got the equivalent of the ENIAC in my lab?\n\n3:00:21.060 --> 3:00:23.540\n We've got 15 computers in the lab now.\n\n3:00:23.540 --> 3:00:24.920\n And they, are they unreliable?\n\n3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:26.940\n Yeah, they fall apart here and there,\n\n3:00:26.940 --> 3:00:29.540\n but are they getting better really quickly?\n\n3:00:29.540 --> 3:00:30.380\n Yeah.\n\n3:00:30.380 --> 3:00:32.280\n Are they now able to reliably make more,\n\n3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:33.320\n are we at the point in the lab\n\n3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:34.780\n where there are some molecules\n\n3:00:34.780 --> 3:00:37.400\n we would rather make on the computer\n\n3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:38.520\n than have a human being make?\n\n3:00:38.520 --> 3:00:39.780\n Yeah, we've just done,\n\n3:00:39.780 --> 3:00:44.000\n we've just made a anti influenza molecule\n\n3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:45.420\n and some antivirals,\n\n3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:49.720\n six steps on the computer that would take a human being\n\n3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:54.720\n about one week to make Arbidol of continuous labor.\n\n3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:56.160\n And all they do now is load up the reagents,\n\n3:00:56.160 --> 3:00:58.240\n press go button and just go away and drink coffee.\n\n3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:02.520\n Wow, so this, I mean, and this is, you're saying\n\n3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:04.320\n this computer is just the early days.\n\n3:01:04.320 --> 3:01:06.840\n And so like some of the criticism just have to do\n\n3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:08.000\n with the early days.\n\n3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:09.400\n And yes, I would say this,\n\n3:01:09.400 --> 3:01:13.960\n something like this is quite impossible.\n\n3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:18.120\n So the fact that you're doing this is incredible.\n\n3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:20.760\n Not impossible, of course, but extremely difficult.\n\n3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:22.960\n It did seem really difficult.\n\n3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:25.080\n And I do keep pinching myself when I go in the lab.\n\n3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:25.920\n I was like, is it working?\n\n3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:26.740\n Like, yep.\n\n3:01:26.740 --> 3:01:30.480\n And it's not, you know, it does clog, it does stop.\n\n3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:32.120\n You got to clean, this is great.\n\n3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:35.120\n It's, you know, but it's getting more reliable\n\n3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.000\n because I made some, we just made design decisions\n\n3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.540\n and said, we are not going to abandon the abstraction.\n\n3:01:40.540 --> 3:01:41.380\n Think about it.\n\n3:01:41.380 --> 3:01:45.920\n If the von Neumann implementation was abandoned,\n\n3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:47.820\n I mean, think about what we do to semiconductors\n\n3:01:47.820 --> 3:01:51.720\n to really constrain them to what we do to silicon\n\n3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:55.400\n in a fab lab, we take computation for granted.\n\n3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:57.640\n Silicon is not in its natural state.\n\n3:01:57.640 --> 3:01:59.040\n We are doping the hell out of it.\n\n3:01:59.040 --> 3:02:00.880\n It's incredible what they're able to accomplish\n\n3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:03.660\n and achieve that reliability at the scale they do.\n\n3:02:03.660 --> 3:02:07.600\n Like you said, that's after Moore's law, what we have now.\n\n3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:12.600\n And where we, you know, how it started, you know,\n\n3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:14.040\n now we're here.\n\n3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:15.480\n We started at the bottom, now we're here.\n\n3:02:15.480 --> 3:02:17.080\n We have only have 20 million molecules.\n\n3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:19.600\n Well, say 20 million molecules in one database,\n\n3:02:19.600 --> 3:02:21.280\n maybe a few hundred million\n\n3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:23.440\n in all the pharmaceutical companies.\n\n3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:26.680\n And those few hundred million molecules are responsible\n\n3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:28.600\n for all the drugs that we've had in humanity,\n\n3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:32.320\n except, you know, biologics for the last 50 years.\n\n3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:35.500\n Now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print,\n\n3:02:35.500 --> 3:02:37.440\n goes out of print because there's only a finite number\n\n3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:38.760\n of manufacturing facilities in the world\n\n3:02:38.760 --> 3:02:39.600\n that make these drugs.\n\n3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:40.440\n It goes out of print.\n\n3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:41.280\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:42.120\n Isn't that computer?\n\n3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:44.080\n This is a printing press, but for chemistry.\n\n3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:45.120\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:47.480\n And not only that, we can protect the KyDL\n\n3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:49.120\n so we can stop bad actors doing it.\n\n3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:51.520\n We can encrypt them and we can give people license.\n\n3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:53.640\n KyDL, that's the name, sorry to interrupt,\n\n3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:54.480\n is the name of the programming language?\n\n3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:56.720\n Yeah, the KyDL is the name of the programming language\n\n3:02:56.720 --> 3:02:58.520\n and the code we give the chemicals.\n\n3:02:58.520 --> 3:03:01.960\n So Ky, as in, you know, just for,\n\n3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:04.120\n it's actually like an XML format,\n\n3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:06.480\n but I've now taken it from script\n\n3:03:06.480 --> 3:03:10.200\n to a fully expressible programming language\n\n3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:12.680\n so we can do dynamics and there's for loops in there\n\n3:03:12.680 --> 3:03:13.840\n and conditional statements.\n\n3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:18.800\n Right, but the structure, it started out as like an XML\n\n3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:19.640\n type of thing.\n\n3:03:19.640 --> 3:03:20.460\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:03:20.460 --> 3:03:22.360\n And also, the chemist doesn't need to program in KyDL.\n\n3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:25.160\n They can just go to the software and type in add A to B,\n\n3:03:25.160 --> 3:03:27.180\n reflux, do what they would normally do,\n\n3:03:27.180 --> 3:03:28.480\n and it just converts it to KyDL\n\n3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:30.520\n and they have a linter to check it and error correct.\n\n3:03:30.520 --> 3:03:34.320\n So how do you, you know, not with ASCII,\n\n3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:36.480\n but because it's a Greek letter,\n\n3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:39.720\n how do you go with, how do you spell it\n\n3:03:39.720 --> 3:03:42.280\n just using the English alphabet?\n\n3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:43.680\n We just, XDL?\n\n3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:46.000\n XDL, but all we use, we put in Ky.\n\n3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:47.560\n And it was named by one of my students\n\n3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:49.920\n and one of my postdocs many years ago\n\n3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:50.960\n and I quite liked it.\n\n3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:53.520\n It's like, it's important, I think,\n\n3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:55.640\n when the team are contributing to such big ideas,\n\n3:03:55.640 --> 3:03:57.520\n cause there's their ideas as well.\n\n3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:00.520\n I try not to just rename, I didn't call it Cronon\n\n3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:03.000\n or anything that, cause they keep saying, you know,\n\n3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:07.380\n is the chemistry, when they're putting stuff\n\n3:04:07.380 --> 3:04:08.880\n in the computer, one of my students said,\n\n3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:10.640\n we're asking now, is it Cronon complete?\n\n3:04:10.640 --> 3:04:11.480\n And I was like, what does that mean?\n\n3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:13.880\n I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine?\n\n3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:18.440\n And I was like, oh, is that a compliment or a majority?\n\n3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:20.720\n But they're like, well, it might be both.\n\n3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:24.600\n Yeah, so you tweeted, quote,\n\n3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:27.440\n why does chemistry need a universal programming language,\n\n3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:28.280\n question mark?\n\n3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:31.840\n For all the reasons you can think of.\n\n3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:35.740\n Reliability, interoperability, collaboration,\n\n3:04:35.740 --> 3:04:39.120\n remove ambiguity, lower cost, increase safety,\n\n3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:42.360\n open up discovery, molecular customization,\n\n3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:46.300\n and publication of executable chemical code.\n\n3:04:46.300 --> 3:04:49.140\n Which is fascinating, by the way.\n\n3:04:49.140 --> 3:04:51.980\n Just publish code.\n\n3:04:51.980 --> 3:04:56.260\n And can you maybe elaborate a little bit more\n\n3:04:56.260 --> 3:04:59.480\n about this CHI DL, what does the universal language\n\n3:04:59.480 --> 3:05:01.480\n of chemistry look like?\n\n3:05:01.480 --> 3:05:04.820\n A Cronon complete language.\n\n3:05:04.820 --> 3:05:07.380\n It's a Turing complete language, really.\n\n3:05:07.380 --> 3:05:11.040\n But, so what it has, it has a series of operators in it,\n\n3:05:11.040 --> 3:05:14.040\n like add, heat, stir.\n\n3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:17.960\n So there's a bunch of unit operations.\n\n3:05:17.960 --> 3:05:19.560\n And all it is, really, is just,\n\n3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:21.880\n it's with chemical engineers,\n\n3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:22.720\n when I talked about this,\n\n3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:26.000\n that you've just rediscovered chemical engineering.\n\n3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:27.760\n And I said, well, yeah, I know.\n\n3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:30.120\n I said, well, that's trivial.\n\n3:05:30.120 --> 3:05:31.840\n I said, well, not really.\n\n3:05:31.840 --> 3:05:33.680\n Well, yes, it is trivial, and that's why it's good,\n\n3:05:33.680 --> 3:05:36.840\n because not only have we rediscovered chemical engineering,\n\n3:05:36.840 --> 3:05:38.940\n we've made it implementable on the universal hardware\n\n3:05:38.940 --> 3:05:40.720\n that doesn't cost very much money.\n\n3:05:40.720 --> 3:05:43.960\n And so the CHI DL has a series of statements.\n\n3:05:43.960 --> 3:05:46.160\n Like define the reactor.\n\n3:05:46.160 --> 3:05:49.320\n So defines the reagents.\n\n3:05:49.320 --> 3:05:52.160\n So they're all labels, so you assign them.\n\n3:05:52.160 --> 3:05:55.440\n And what I also implemented at the beginning is,\n\n3:05:55.440 --> 3:05:57.980\n because I give all the hardware IP address,\n\n3:05:57.980 --> 3:05:59.400\n you put it on a graph.\n\n3:05:59.400 --> 3:06:02.280\n And so what it does is like the graph is equivalent\n\n3:06:02.280 --> 3:06:06.600\n to the processor firmware, the processor code.\n\n3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:08.600\n So when you take your CHI DL,\n\n3:06:08.600 --> 3:06:10.160\n and you go to run it on your computer,\n\n3:06:10.160 --> 3:06:12.040\n you can run it on any compatible hardware\n\n3:06:12.040 --> 3:06:14.840\n in any configuration, it says, what does your graph look like?\n\n3:06:14.840 --> 3:06:17.000\n As long as I can solve the problem on the graph\n\n3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:17.840\n with these unit operations,\n\n3:06:17.840 --> 3:06:20.360\n and you have the resources available, it can compile.\n\n3:06:20.360 --> 3:06:21.680\n Chem piles.\n\n3:06:21.680 --> 3:06:22.520\n Ah ha.\n\n3:06:22.520 --> 3:06:23.360\n Ha ha ha.\n\n3:06:23.360 --> 3:06:24.200\n Ha ha ha.\n\n3:06:24.200 --> 3:06:25.640\n Oh.\n\n3:06:25.640 --> 3:06:27.080\n All right, we can carry on for years.\n\n3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:29.080\n But it is really, it's chempilation.\n\n3:06:29.080 --> 3:06:29.920\n Chempilation, yeah.\n\n3:06:29.920 --> 3:06:32.740\n And what it now does is it says, okay,\n\n3:06:32.740 --> 3:06:35.440\n the problem we have before is it was possible\n\n3:06:35.440 --> 3:06:37.800\n to do robotics for chemistry,\n\n3:06:37.800 --> 3:06:39.440\n but the robots were really expensive.\n\n3:06:39.440 --> 3:06:40.600\n They were unique.\n\n3:06:40.600 --> 3:06:42.800\n They were vendor locked.\n\n3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:44.520\n And what I want to do is to make sure\n\n3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:46.880\n that every chemist in the world can get access\n\n3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:49.960\n to machinery like this at virtually no cost,\n\n3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:51.800\n because it makes it safer.\n\n3:06:51.800 --> 3:06:53.720\n It makes it more reliable.\n\n3:06:53.720 --> 3:06:55.280\n And then if you go to the literature\n\n3:06:55.280 --> 3:06:58.360\n and you find a molecule that could potentially cure cancer,\n\n3:06:58.360 --> 3:06:59.840\n and let's say the molecule that could potentially\n\n3:06:59.840 --> 3:07:03.000\n cure cancer takes you three years to repeat,\n\n3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:06.560\n and maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time\n\n3:07:06.560 --> 3:07:07.920\n and they never get it back.\n\n3:07:07.920 --> 3:07:12.720\n So that it's really hard to kind of get all the way\n\n3:07:12.720 --> 3:07:14.480\n to that molecule, and it limits the ability\n\n3:07:14.480 --> 3:07:16.400\n of humanity to build on it.\n\n3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:19.000\n If they just download the code and can execute it,\n\n3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:22.680\n it turns, I would say the electronic laboratory notebook\n\n3:07:22.680 --> 3:07:25.240\n in chemistry is a data cemetery,\n\n3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:28.560\n because no one will ever reproduce it.\n\n3:07:28.560 --> 3:07:30.900\n For now, the data cemetery is a Jupiter notebook\n\n3:07:30.900 --> 3:07:31.740\n and you can just execute it.\n\n3:07:31.740 --> 3:07:33.600\n A notebook and people can play with it,\n\n3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:34.640\n the access to it.\n\n3:07:34.640 --> 3:07:35.480\n Reversion it.\n\n3:07:35.480 --> 3:07:37.680\n Orders of magnitude is increased.\n\n3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:41.480\n We'll talk about the, so as with all technologies,\n\n3:07:41.480 --> 3:07:43.800\n I think there's way more exciting possibilities,\n\n3:07:43.800 --> 3:07:45.660\n but there are also terrifying possibilities,\n\n3:07:45.660 --> 3:07:47.400\n and we'll talk about all of them.\n\n3:07:47.400 --> 3:07:50.920\n But let me just kind of linger on the machine learning\n\n3:07:50.920 --> 3:07:51.760\n side of this.\n\n3:07:51.760 --> 3:07:53.480\n So you're describing programming,\n\n3:07:53.480 --> 3:07:57.480\n but it's a language, I don't know if you've heard\n\n3:07:57.480 --> 3:07:59.400\n about OpenAI Codex, which is.\n\n3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:00.600\n Yeah, I'm playing with it.\n\n3:08:00.600 --> 3:08:02.560\n You're playing, of course you are.\n\n3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:07.560\n Yeah, you really are Rick from Rick and Morty.\n\n3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:08.800\n This is great.\n\n3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:12.160\n Okay, except philosophically deep.\n\n3:08:12.160 --> 3:08:14.980\n I mean, he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too.\n\n3:08:14.980 --> 3:08:18.540\n So for people who don't know, GPT, GPT3,\n\n3:08:18.540 --> 3:08:21.560\n that's a language model that can do natural language\n\n3:08:21.560 --> 3:08:23.920\n generation, so you can give it a prompt\n\n3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:26.440\n and it can complete the rest of it.\n\n3:08:26.440 --> 3:08:28.920\n But it turns out that that kind of prompt,\n\n3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:30.760\n it's not just completes the rest of it,\n\n3:08:30.760 --> 3:08:35.760\n it's generating like novel sounding text,\n\n3:08:36.440 --> 3:08:38.280\n and then you can apply that to generation\n\n3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:40.700\n of other kinds of stuff.\n\n3:08:40.700 --> 3:08:43.920\n So these kinds of transformer based language models\n\n3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:48.920\n are really good at forming deep representations\n\n3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:54.440\n of a particular space, like a medium, like language.\n\n3:08:54.440 --> 3:08:56.900\n So you can then apply it to specific subset of language\n\n3:08:56.900 --> 3:09:00.840\n like programming, so you can have it learn\n\n3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:03.200\n the representation of the Python programming language\n\n3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:06.560\n and use it to then generate syntactically\n\n3:09:06.560 --> 3:09:10.440\n and semantically correct programs.\n\n3:09:10.440 --> 3:09:13.000\n So you can start to make progress on one of the hardest\n\n3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:16.080\n problems in computer science, which is program synthesis.\n\n3:09:16.080 --> 3:09:19.640\n How do you write programs that accomplish different tasks?\n\n3:09:19.640 --> 3:09:24.640\n So what OpenAI Codex does is it to generate\n\n3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:28.700\n those programs based on a prompt of some kind.\n\n3:09:28.700 --> 3:09:30.780\n Usually you can do a natural language prompt,\n\n3:09:30.780 --> 3:09:32.780\n so basically as you do when you program,\n\n3:09:32.780 --> 3:09:37.780\n you write some comment which serves the basic documentation\n\n3:09:37.940 --> 3:09:40.100\n of the inputs and the outputs and the function\n\n3:09:40.100 --> 3:09:41.660\n of the particular set of code and it's able\n\n3:09:41.660 --> 3:09:43.300\n to generate that.\n\n3:09:43.300 --> 3:09:45.820\n Point being is you can generate programs\n\n3:09:46.740 --> 3:09:49.660\n using machine learning, using neural networks.\n\n3:09:49.660 --> 3:09:54.660\n Those programs operate on the boring old computer.\n\n3:09:56.980 --> 3:09:59.580\n Can you generate programs that operate,\n\n3:09:59.580 --> 3:10:01.700\n this gotta be a clever version of programs for this,\n\n3:10:01.700 --> 3:10:06.460\n but can you write programs that operate on a computer?\n\n3:10:06.460 --> 3:10:08.780\n Yep, there's actually software out there right now\n\n3:10:08.780 --> 3:10:10.340\n you can go and do it.\n\n3:10:10.340 --> 3:10:11.180\n Really?\n\n3:10:11.180 --> 3:10:14.300\n Yeah, yeah, it's a heuristic, it's rule based,\n\n3:10:14.300 --> 3:10:19.300\n but we have, what we've done, inspired by Codex actually,\n\n3:10:20.340 --> 3:10:23.540\n is over the summer I ran a little workshop.\n\n3:10:23.540 --> 3:10:25.140\n Some of my groups got this inspired idea\n\n3:10:25.140 --> 3:10:28.060\n that we should get a load of students\n\n3:10:28.060 --> 3:10:30.660\n and ask them to manually collect data,\n\n3:10:30.660 --> 3:10:35.220\n to label chemical procedures into Kydy L.\n\n3:10:35.220 --> 3:10:38.820\n And we have a cool synth reader.\n\n3:10:38.820 --> 3:10:41.940\n So there's a bunch of people doing this right now,\n\n3:10:41.940 --> 3:10:45.140\n but they're doing it without abstraction.\n\n3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:47.460\n And because we have an abstraction\n\n3:10:47.460 --> 3:10:50.260\n that's implementable in the hardware,\n\n3:10:50.260 --> 3:10:54.900\n we've developed basically a chemical analog of Codex.\n\n3:10:54.900 --> 3:10:56.900\n When you say, sorry to interrupt,\n\n3:10:56.900 --> 3:10:59.900\n when you say abstraction in the hardware, what do you mean?\n\n3:10:59.900 --> 3:11:01.800\n So right now, a lot of people doing machine learning\n\n3:11:01.800 --> 3:11:04.480\n and reading chemistry and saying,\n\n3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:05.980\n oh, you've got all these operations,\n\n3:11:05.980 --> 3:11:07.840\n add, shake, whatever, heat.\n\n3:11:07.840 --> 3:11:11.260\n But because they don't have a uniform,\n\n3:11:11.260 --> 3:11:12.820\n I mean, it's a couple of groups doing it,\n\n3:11:12.820 --> 3:11:15.660\n competitors actually, and they're good, very good.\n\n3:11:15.660 --> 3:11:20.500\n But they can't run that code automatically.\n\n3:11:20.500 --> 3:11:23.720\n They are losing meaning.\n\n3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:28.300\n And the really important thing that you have to do\n\n3:11:28.300 --> 3:11:29.980\n is generate context.\n\n3:11:29.980 --> 3:11:32.780\n And so what we've learned to do with our abstraction\n\n3:11:32.780 --> 3:11:36.380\n is make sure we can pull the context out of the text.\n\n3:11:36.380 --> 3:11:40.500\n And so can we take a chemical procedure\n\n3:11:40.500 --> 3:11:42.840\n and read it and generate our executable code?\n\n3:11:42.840 --> 3:11:43.960\n Yes.\n\n3:11:43.960 --> 3:11:45.980\n What's the hardest part about that whole pipeline\n\n3:11:45.980 --> 3:11:48.300\n from the initial text, interpreting the initial text\n\n3:11:48.300 --> 3:11:52.240\n of a paper, extracting the meaningful context\n\n3:11:52.240 --> 3:11:54.380\n and the meaningful chemical information\n\n3:11:54.380 --> 3:11:56.780\n to then generating the program\n\n3:11:56.780 --> 3:12:00.300\n to then running that program in the hardware?\n\n3:12:00.300 --> 3:12:02.340\n What's the hardest part about that pipeline\n\n3:12:02.340 --> 3:12:05.780\n as we look towards a universal Turing computer?\n\n3:12:05.780 --> 3:12:10.580\n So the hardest thing with the pipeline\n\n3:12:10.580 --> 3:12:15.580\n is that the software, the model gets confused\n\n3:12:16.500 --> 3:12:18.300\n between some meanings, right?\n\n3:12:18.300 --> 3:12:21.700\n So if, you know, chemists are very good at inventing words\n\n3:12:21.700 --> 3:12:22.840\n that aren't broken down.\n\n3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:25.960\n So I would, the classic word that you would use\n\n3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:28.200\n for boiling something is called reflux.\n\n3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:31.020\n So reflux is, you would have a solvent\n\n3:12:31.020 --> 3:12:33.720\n in a round bottom flask, at reflux it would be boiling,\n\n3:12:33.720 --> 3:12:35.980\n going up the reflux condenser and coming down.\n\n3:12:35.980 --> 3:12:40.180\n But that term reflux to reflux could be changed, you know,\n\n3:12:40.180 --> 3:12:44.300\n to people often make up words, new words,\n\n3:12:44.300 --> 3:12:47.340\n and then the software can fall over.\n\n3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:50.940\n But what we've been able to do is a bit like in Python\n\n3:12:50.940 --> 3:12:53.380\n or any programming language is identify\n\n3:12:53.380 --> 3:12:55.100\n when things aren't matched.\n\n3:12:55.100 --> 3:12:57.340\n So you present the code and you say, this isn't matched.\n\n3:12:57.340 --> 3:12:58.540\n You may want to think about this.\n\n3:12:58.540 --> 3:13:01.100\n And then the user goes and says, oh, I mean reflux\n\n3:13:01.100 --> 3:13:02.660\n and just ticks a box and collects it.\n\n3:13:02.660 --> 3:13:07.660\n So what the Codex or the Chemex does in this case\n\n3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:12.500\n is it just, it suggests the first go\n\n3:13:12.500 --> 3:13:14.100\n and then the chemist goes in and corrects it.\n\n3:13:14.100 --> 3:13:16.220\n And I really want the chemist to correct it\n\n3:13:16.220 --> 3:13:21.220\n because it's not safe, I believe, for it to allow AI\n\n3:13:21.980 --> 3:13:25.060\n to just read literature and generate code at this stage.\n\n3:13:25.060 --> 3:13:28.540\n Because now you're having actual, by the way, Chemex,\n\n3:13:28.540 --> 3:13:33.540\n nice, nice name, so you are unlike, which is fascinating.\n\n3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:42.340\n It's that we live in a fascinating moment in human history.\n\n3:13:42.340 --> 3:13:47.020\n But yes, you're literally connecting AI\n\n3:13:47.020 --> 3:13:52.020\n to some physical and like it's building something\n\n3:13:52.140 --> 3:13:55.180\n in the physical realm, especially in the space\n\n3:13:55.180 --> 3:14:00.180\n of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly.\n\n3:14:02.660 --> 3:14:05.500\n Yeah, yeah, I would say that's right.\n\n3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:07.420\n And it's really important to understand\n\n3:14:07.420 --> 3:14:09.280\n those labeling schemes, right?\n\n3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:11.340\n And one of the things I was never,\n\n3:14:11.340 --> 3:14:12.700\n I was always worried about the beginning\n\n3:14:12.700 --> 3:14:15.260\n that the abstraction was gonna fall over.\n\n3:14:15.260 --> 3:14:18.340\n And the way we did it was just by brute force to start with.\n\n3:14:18.340 --> 3:14:19.880\n We just kept reading the literature and saying,\n\n3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:20.720\n is there anything new?\n\n3:14:20.720 --> 3:14:21.740\n Can we add a new rule in?\n\n3:14:21.740 --> 3:14:25.380\n And actually our KyDL language expanded, exploded.\n\n3:14:25.380 --> 3:14:28.140\n There was so many extra things we had to keep adding.\n\n3:14:28.140 --> 3:14:31.140\n And then I realized the primitives still were maintained\n\n3:14:31.140 --> 3:14:32.640\n and I could break them down again.\n\n3:14:32.640 --> 3:14:35.100\n So it's pretty good.\n\n3:14:35.100 --> 3:14:36.120\n I mean, there are problems.\n\n3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:38.500\n There are problems of interpreting any big sentence\n\n3:14:38.500 --> 3:14:40.700\n and turning it into an actionable code.\n\n3:14:40.700 --> 3:14:42.300\n And in Codex, it's not without its problems.\n\n3:14:42.300 --> 3:14:44.080\n You can crash it quite easily, right?\n\n3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:45.540\n You can generate nonsense.\n\n3:14:45.540 --> 3:14:47.680\n But boy, it's interesting.\n\n3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.680\n I would love to learn to program now using Codex, right?\n\n3:14:52.780 --> 3:14:54.180\n Just hacking around, right?\n\n3:14:54.180 --> 3:14:55.940\n And I wonder if chemists in the future will learn\n\n3:14:55.940 --> 3:15:00.940\n to do chemistry by just hacking around with the system\n\n3:15:01.220 --> 3:15:02.140\n and writing different things.\n\n3:15:02.140 --> 3:15:04.300\n Because the key thing that we're doing with the chemistry\n\n3:15:04.300 --> 3:15:07.220\n is that where a lot of mathematical chemistry went wrong\n\n3:15:07.220 --> 3:15:11.540\n is people, and I think Wolfram does this in Mathematica,\n\n3:15:11.540 --> 3:15:15.660\n he assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom A\n\n3:15:15.660 --> 3:15:17.460\n or molecule A reacts with molecule B\n\n3:15:17.460 --> 3:15:18.300\n to give molecule C.\n\n3:15:18.300 --> 3:15:20.460\n That's not what chemistry is.\n\n3:15:20.460 --> 3:15:23.100\n Chemistry is take some molecule,\n\n3:15:23.100 --> 3:15:26.740\n take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it\n\n3:15:27.740 --> 3:15:29.380\n and then extract it.\n\n3:15:29.380 --> 3:15:32.540\n So the programming language is actually with respect\n\n3:15:32.540 --> 3:15:35.380\n to the process operations.\n\n3:15:35.380 --> 3:15:37.800\n And if you flick in process space,\n\n3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:41.500\n not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything\n\n3:15:41.500 --> 3:15:43.220\n because there's only a finite number of processes\n\n3:15:43.220 --> 3:15:45.180\n you need to do in chemistry.\n\n3:15:45.180 --> 3:15:47.220\n And that's reassuring.\n\n3:15:47.220 --> 3:15:50.420\n And so we're in the middle of it, it's really exciting.\n\n3:15:51.620 --> 3:15:53.620\n It's not the be all and the end all.\n\n3:15:53.620 --> 3:15:55.800\n And there is like I say, errors that can creep in.\n\n3:15:55.800 --> 3:15:58.620\n One day we might be able to do it without human interaction\n\n3:15:58.620 --> 3:15:59.460\n and you simulate it.\n\n3:15:59.460 --> 3:16:01.500\n And you'll know enough about the simulation\n\n3:16:01.500 --> 3:16:05.420\n that the lab won't catch fire.\n\n3:16:05.420 --> 3:16:07.060\n But there are so many safety issues right now\n\n3:16:07.060 --> 3:16:09.740\n that we've got to really be very careful,\n\n3:16:09.740 --> 3:16:11.940\n protecting the user, protecting the environment,\n\n3:16:11.940 --> 3:16:13.040\n protecting misuse.\n\n3:16:13.040 --> 3:16:14.880\n I mean, there's lots to discuss\n\n3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:16.100\n if you want to go down that route\n\n3:16:16.100 --> 3:16:17.620\n because it's very, very interesting.\n\n3:16:17.620 --> 3:16:20.620\n You don't want Novichoks being made\n\n3:16:20.620 --> 3:16:25.620\n or explosives being made or recreational drugs being made.\n\n3:16:26.340 --> 3:16:30.380\n But how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug\n\n3:16:30.380 --> 3:16:32.100\n that's gonna be important for them looking\n\n3:16:32.100 --> 3:16:35.260\n at their particular assay\n\n3:16:35.260 --> 3:16:38.940\n on a bad actor trying to make methamphetamine?\n\n3:16:38.940 --> 3:16:41.100\n I saw how you looked at me when you said bad actor,\n\n3:16:41.100 --> 3:16:42.940\n but that's exactly what I'm gonna do.\n\n3:16:42.940 --> 3:16:45.460\n I'm trying to get the details of this so I can be first.\n\n3:16:45.460 --> 3:16:47.460\n Don't worry, we can protect you from yourself.\n\n3:16:47.460 --> 3:16:48.300\n Okay.\n\n3:16:50.180 --> 3:16:54.060\n I'm not sure that's true, but that statement gives me hope.\n\n3:16:54.060 --> 3:16:59.060\n Does this ultimately excite you about the future\n\n3:17:00.660 --> 3:17:01.980\n or does it terrify you?\n\n3:17:01.980 --> 3:17:06.980\n So let's, we mentioned that time is fundamental.\n\n3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:12.120\n It seems like you're at the cutting edge of progress\n\n3:17:12.120 --> 3:17:15.760\n that will have to happen, that will happen,\n\n3:17:15.760 --> 3:17:17.340\n that there's no stopping it.\n\n3:17:18.640 --> 3:17:20.800\n And I, as we've been talking about,\n\n3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:24.640\n I see obviously a huge number of exciting possibilities.\n\n3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:29.280\n So whenever you automate these kinds of things,\n\n3:17:29.280 --> 3:17:31.400\n just the world opens up.\n\n3:17:31.400 --> 3:17:34.600\n It's like programming itself and the computer,\n\n3:17:34.600 --> 3:17:39.520\n regular computer, has created innumerable applications.\n\n3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:43.600\n It made the world better in so many dimensions.\n\n3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:45.960\n And it created, of course, a lot of negative things\n\n3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:48.960\n that we, for some reason, like to focus on\n\n3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:52.400\n using that very technology to tweet about it.\n\n3:17:52.400 --> 3:17:55.500\n But I think it made a much better world,\n\n3:17:55.500 --> 3:17:57.600\n but it created a lot of new dangers.\n\n3:17:57.600 --> 3:18:02.600\n So maybe you can speak to when you have,\n\n3:18:02.600 --> 3:18:07.600\n when you kind of stand at the end of the road\n\n3:18:07.600 --> 3:18:12.600\n for building a really solid, reliable, universal computer.\n\n3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:16.400\n What are the possibilities that are positive?\n\n3:18:16.400 --> 3:18:18.120\n What are the possibilities that are negative?\n\n3:18:18.120 --> 3:18:21.080\n How can we minimize the chance of the negative?\n\n3:18:21.080 --> 3:18:22.460\n Yeah, that's a really good question.\n\n3:18:22.460 --> 3:18:23.960\n So there's so many positive things,\n\n3:18:23.960 --> 3:18:28.760\n from drug discovery, from supply chain stress,\n\n3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:30.680\n for basically enabling chemists\n\n3:18:30.680 --> 3:18:32.600\n to basically build more productive in the lab, right?\n\n3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:35.320\n Where this is, the computer's not gonna replace the chemist.\n\n3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:37.400\n There's gonna be a Moore's law of molecules, right?\n\n3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:39.760\n There's gonna be so many more molecules we can design,\n\n3:18:39.760 --> 3:18:41.560\n so many more diseases we can cure.\n\n3:18:41.560 --> 3:18:43.420\n So chemists in the lab as researchers,\n\n3:18:43.420 --> 3:18:44.740\n that's better for science.\n\n3:18:44.740 --> 3:18:46.520\n So they can build a bunch of,\n\n3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:50.400\n like they could do science at a much more accelerated pace.\n\n3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:51.960\n So it's not just the development of drugs,\n\n3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:54.300\n it's actually like doing the basic understanding\n\n3:18:54.300 --> 3:18:55.200\n and the science of drugs.\n\n3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:57.760\n And the personalization, the cost of drugs right now,\n\n3:18:57.760 --> 3:19:00.360\n we're all living longer, we're all having more and more,\n\n3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:02.320\n we know more about our genomic development,\n\n3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:05.000\n we know about our predetermination,\n\n3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:06.440\n and we might be able to,\n\n3:19:06.440 --> 3:19:07.920\n one dream I've got is like,\n\n3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:11.880\n imagine you can work at your genome assistant\n\n3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:14.600\n tells you you're gonna get cancer in seven years time,\n\n3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:16.800\n and you have your personal computer\n\n3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:20.060\n that cooks up the right molecule just for you to cure it,\n\n3:19:20.060 --> 3:19:20.900\n right?\n\n3:19:20.900 --> 3:19:22.480\n That's a really positive idea.\n\n3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:25.240\n The other thing is when drugs,\n\n3:19:25.240 --> 3:19:28.640\n so right now I think it's absolutely outrageous\n\n3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:33.140\n that not all of humanity has access to medicine.\n\n3:19:33.140 --> 3:19:34.780\n And I think the computer\n\n3:19:34.780 --> 3:19:36.020\n might be able to change that fundamentally\n\n3:19:36.020 --> 3:19:38.960\n because it will disrupt the way things are manufactured.\n\n3:19:38.960 --> 3:19:40.860\n So let's stop thinking about manufacturing\n\n3:19:40.860 --> 3:19:41.900\n in different factories.\n\n3:19:41.900 --> 3:19:44.420\n Let's say that computers,\n\n3:19:44.420 --> 3:19:47.040\n clinical grade computers or drug grade computers\n\n3:19:47.040 --> 3:19:49.760\n will be in facilities all around the world,\n\n3:19:49.760 --> 3:19:52.720\n and they can make things on demand\n\n3:19:52.720 --> 3:19:54.440\n as a function of the cost.\n\n3:19:54.440 --> 3:19:55.640\n Maybe people won't be able to afford\n\n3:19:55.640 --> 3:19:57.200\n the latest and greatest patent,\n\n3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:00.160\n but maybe they'll be able to get the next best thing\n\n3:20:00.160 --> 3:20:02.800\n and will basically democratize,\n\n3:20:02.800 --> 3:20:06.640\n make available drugs to everybody that they need.\n\n3:20:06.640 --> 3:20:10.560\n And there's lots of really interesting things there.\n\n3:20:10.560 --> 3:20:12.520\n So I think that's gonna happen.\n\n3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:16.980\n I think that now let's take the negative.\n\n3:20:16.980 --> 3:20:18.260\n Before we do that,\n\n3:20:18.260 --> 3:20:19.480\n let's imagine what happened,\n\n3:20:19.480 --> 3:20:21.920\n go back to a really tragic accident a few years ago,\n\n3:20:21.920 --> 3:20:23.000\n well not accident,\n\n3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:26.080\n an act of murder by that pilot on the,\n\n3:20:26.080 --> 3:20:28.360\n I think it was Eurowings or Swisswings.\n\n3:20:28.360 --> 3:20:30.700\n But what he did is plane took off,\n\n3:20:30.700 --> 3:20:33.500\n he waited till his pilot went to the toilet,\n\n3:20:33.500 --> 3:20:34.340\n he was a co pilot,\n\n3:20:34.340 --> 3:20:37.780\n he locked the door and then set the autopilot\n\n3:20:39.180 --> 3:20:40.020\n above the Alps,\n\n3:20:40.020 --> 3:20:44.200\n he set the altimeter or the descend height to zero.\n\n3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:48.100\n So the computer just took the plane into the Alps.\n\n3:20:48.100 --> 3:20:51.500\n Now, I mean, that was such a tragedy\n\n3:20:51.500 --> 3:20:53.180\n that obviously the guy was mentally ill,\n\n3:20:53.180 --> 3:20:55.100\n but it wasn't just a tragedy for him,\n\n3:20:55.100 --> 3:20:57.060\n it was for all the people on board.\n\n3:20:57.060 --> 3:20:58.940\n But what if, and I was inspired by this\n\n3:20:58.940 --> 3:21:03.140\n and my thinking, what can I do to anticipate\n\n3:21:03.140 --> 3:21:05.260\n problems like this in the computer?\n\n3:21:05.260 --> 3:21:06.900\n Had the software,\n\n3:21:06.900 --> 3:21:09.300\n and I'm sure Boeing and Airbus will be thinking,\n\n3:21:09.300 --> 3:21:11.260\n oh, maybe I can give the computer\n\n3:21:11.260 --> 3:21:12.660\n a bit more situational awareness.\n\n3:21:12.660 --> 3:21:15.660\n So whenever one tries to drop the height of the plane\n\n3:21:15.660 --> 3:21:16.860\n and it knows it's above the Alps,\n\n3:21:16.860 --> 3:21:18.460\n we'll just say, oh no, computer says no,\n\n3:21:18.460 --> 3:21:20.540\n we're not letting you do that.\n\n3:21:20.540 --> 3:21:22.240\n Of course, he would have been able to find another way,\n\n3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:24.260\n maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel or something,\n\n3:21:24.260 --> 3:21:25.340\n but you know.\n\n3:21:25.340 --> 3:21:28.820\n Keep anticipating all the large number of trajectories\n\n3:21:28.820 --> 3:21:29.660\n that can go negative,\n\n3:21:29.660 --> 3:21:31.420\n all those kinds of running into the Alps\n\n3:21:31.420 --> 3:21:35.700\n and try to at least make it easy\n\n3:21:35.700 --> 3:21:38.500\n for the engineers to build systems that are protecting us.\n\n3:21:38.500 --> 3:21:40.460\n Yeah, and let's just think,\n\n3:21:40.460 --> 3:21:43.020\n what in the computer world right now with Kydeals,\n\n3:21:43.020 --> 3:21:45.020\n let's just not think about what I'm doing right now.\n\n3:21:45.020 --> 3:21:47.100\n What I'm doing right now is it's completely open, right?\n\n3:21:47.100 --> 3:21:48.980\n Everyone's gonna know Kydeals and be playing with them,\n\n3:21:48.980 --> 3:21:51.340\n making them more easier and easier and easier.\n\n3:21:51.340 --> 3:21:53.020\n But what we're gonna start to do,\n\n3:21:53.020 --> 3:21:58.020\n it makes sense to encrypt the Kydeals in such a way,\n\n3:21:59.060 --> 3:22:01.180\n let's say you work for a pharmaceutical company\n\n3:22:01.180 --> 3:22:03.580\n and you have a license to make given molecule,\n\n3:22:03.580 --> 3:22:05.220\n well, you get issued with a license\n\n3:22:05.220 --> 3:22:07.460\n by the FDA or your local authority\n\n3:22:07.460 --> 3:22:08.940\n and they'll say, right, your license to do it,\n\n3:22:08.940 --> 3:22:12.380\n here it is, it's encrypted and the Kydeal gets run.\n\n3:22:12.380 --> 3:22:15.460\n So you have a license for that instance of use, easy to do.\n\n3:22:15.460 --> 3:22:17.620\n Computer science has already solved the problem.\n\n3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:21.260\n So the fact that we all trust online banking, right,\n\n3:22:21.260 --> 3:22:23.100\n the right now, then we can secure it.\n\n3:22:23.100 --> 3:22:26.580\n I'm 100% sure we can secure the computer.\n\n3:22:26.580 --> 3:22:28.620\n And because of the way we have a many,\n\n3:22:28.620 --> 3:22:32.700\n it's like the same mapping problem that you,\n\n3:22:32.700 --> 3:22:34.460\n to actually reverse engineer a Kydeal\n\n3:22:34.460 --> 3:22:37.380\n will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key,\n\n3:22:38.740 --> 3:22:40.260\n brute force, it will be cheaper\n\n3:22:41.260 --> 3:22:44.420\n to just actually buy the regulated medicine.\n\n3:22:44.420 --> 3:22:46.900\n And actually people aren't gonna want to then\n\n3:22:46.900 --> 3:22:49.380\n make their own fake pharmaceuticals\n\n3:22:49.380 --> 3:22:51.380\n because it'll be so cheap to do it.\n\n3:22:51.380 --> 3:22:53.700\n We'll drop the cost of access to drugs.\n\n3:22:53.700 --> 3:22:54.780\n Now what will happen?\n\n3:22:54.780 --> 3:22:56.180\n Recreational drugs.\n\n3:22:56.180 --> 3:22:57.020\n People will start saying,\n\n3:22:57.020 --> 3:22:59.700\n well, I want access to recreational drugs.\n\n3:22:59.700 --> 3:23:01.220\n Well, it's gonna be up to,\n\n3:23:01.220 --> 3:23:03.940\n it's gonna accelerate that social discussion\n\n3:23:03.940 --> 3:23:06.340\n that's happening in the US and Canada and UK,\n\n3:23:06.340 --> 3:23:07.180\n everywhere, right?\n\n3:23:07.180 --> 3:23:10.340\n Because cost goes down, access goes up.\n\n3:23:10.340 --> 3:23:13.780\n Giving cannabis THC to some people who've got epilepsy\n\n3:23:13.780 --> 3:23:16.540\n isn't literally, forgive the term, a no brainer\n\n3:23:16.540 --> 3:23:19.660\n because these poor people go from seizures like every day\n\n3:23:19.660 --> 3:23:22.500\n to maybe seizures just once every few months.\n\n3:23:22.500 --> 3:23:25.460\n That's an interesting idea to try to minimize the chance\n\n3:23:25.460 --> 3:23:29.020\n that it can get into like the hands of individuals\n\n3:23:29.020 --> 3:23:32.940\n like terrorists or people that want to do harm.\n\n3:23:32.940 --> 3:23:35.700\n Now with that kind of thing,\n\n3:23:35.700 --> 3:23:39.180\n you're putting a lot of power in the hands of governments,\n\n3:23:39.180 --> 3:23:40.500\n in the hands of institutions.\n\n3:23:40.500 --> 3:23:44.140\n And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism\n\n3:23:44.140 --> 3:23:47.420\n you might have of governments that can sometimes use these\n\n3:23:47.420 --> 3:23:50.940\n for ill, use them as weapons of war,\n\n3:23:50.940 --> 3:23:54.700\n not tools of betterment.\n\n3:23:54.700 --> 3:23:59.580\n So, and sometimes not just war against other nations,\n\n3:23:59.580 --> 3:24:01.540\n but war against its own people\n\n3:24:01.540 --> 3:24:03.460\n as it has been done throughout history.\n\n3:24:04.540 --> 3:24:06.220\n Well, I'm thinking, so there's another way of doing it,\n\n3:24:06.220 --> 3:24:09.260\n a decentralized peer to peer version\n\n3:24:09.260 --> 3:24:11.220\n where, and what you have to do,\n\n3:24:11.220 --> 3:24:13.060\n I'm not saying you should adopt a blockchain,\n\n3:24:13.060 --> 3:24:14.940\n but there is a way of maybe taking Kydeals\n\n3:24:14.940 --> 3:24:16.220\n and put them in blockchain.\n\n3:24:16.220 --> 3:24:17.780\n Here's an idea, let's just say,\n\n3:24:17.780 --> 3:24:18.820\n the way we're doing it in my lab right now\n\n3:24:18.820 --> 3:24:20.420\n is we go to the literature,\n\n3:24:20.420 --> 3:24:23.140\n we take a recipe to make a molecule,\n\n3:24:23.140 --> 3:24:27.180\n convert that to Kydeal and diligently make it in the robot\n\n3:24:27.180 --> 3:24:28.180\n and validate it.\n\n3:24:28.180 --> 3:24:31.740\n We, that, so we, I would call mining proof of work,\n\n3:24:31.740 --> 3:24:34.060\n proof of synthesis, right?\n\n3:24:34.060 --> 3:24:35.060\n Proof of the synthesis.\n\n3:24:35.060 --> 3:24:37.820\n Yeah, yeah, but this is cool because suddenly\n\n3:24:37.820 --> 3:24:38.980\n when you actually synthesize it,\n\n3:24:38.980 --> 3:24:40.180\n you can get the analytical data,\n\n3:24:40.180 --> 3:24:41.540\n but there's also a fingerprint in there\n\n3:24:41.540 --> 3:24:43.660\n of the impurities that get carried across\n\n3:24:43.660 --> 3:24:46.420\n because you can never make one, something 100% pure.\n\n3:24:46.420 --> 3:24:49.700\n That fingerprint will allow you to secure your Kydeal.\n\n3:24:49.700 --> 3:24:51.500\n So what you do is encrypt those two things.\n\n3:24:51.500 --> 3:24:54.140\n So suddenly you can have people out there mining\n\n3:24:54.140 --> 3:24:58.060\n and what you could do perhaps is do the type of thing,\n\n3:24:58.060 --> 3:25:01.660\n we need to basically look at the way that contact tracing\n\n3:25:01.660 --> 3:25:03.220\n should have been done in COVID\n\n3:25:03.220 --> 3:25:05.500\n where people are given the information.\n\n3:25:05.500 --> 3:25:07.940\n So you have just been in contact with someone COVID,\n\n3:25:07.940 --> 3:25:10.540\n you choose, I'm not telling you to stay at home,\n\n3:25:10.540 --> 3:25:12.260\n you choose, right?\n\n3:25:12.260 --> 3:25:14.260\n So now if we could imagine a similar thing,\n\n3:25:14.260 --> 3:25:17.460\n like, you know, you have got access to these chemicals,\n\n3:25:17.460 --> 3:25:18.500\n they will have these effects,\n\n3:25:18.500 --> 3:25:20.940\n you choose and publicize it,\n\n3:25:20.940 --> 3:25:22.660\n or maybe it's out somewhere, I don't know.\n\n3:25:22.660 --> 3:25:25.260\n I'm not a policymaker on this.\n\n3:25:25.260 --> 3:25:26.820\n And what my job here is\n\n3:25:26.820 --> 3:25:29.220\n to not just make the technology possible,\n\n3:25:29.220 --> 3:25:31.940\n but to have as open as a discussion as possible\n\n3:25:31.940 --> 3:25:33.380\n with people to say, hey,\n\n3:25:33.380 --> 3:25:36.900\n can we stop childhood mortality with this technology?\n\n3:25:36.900 --> 3:25:40.300\n And do those benefits outweigh the one off\n\n3:25:40.300 --> 3:25:42.420\n where people might use it for terrorism\n\n3:25:42.420 --> 3:25:45.380\n or people might use it for recreational drugs?\n\n3:25:45.380 --> 3:25:47.340\n Chemify, which is the name of the entity\n\n3:25:47.340 --> 3:25:48.540\n that will make this happen,\n\n3:25:48.540 --> 3:25:51.660\n I think we have some social responsibilities as an entity\n\n3:25:51.660 --> 3:25:53.340\n to make sure that we're not enabling people\n\n3:25:53.340 --> 3:25:56.740\n to manufacture personal drugs, weapons at will.\n\n3:25:56.740 --> 3:25:59.620\n And what we have to do is have a discussion with society,\n\n3:25:59.620 --> 3:26:01.260\n with the people that invest in this,\n\n3:26:01.260 --> 3:26:03.660\n with people that are gonna pay for this,\n\n3:26:03.660 --> 3:26:05.820\n to say, well, do you wanna live longer?\n\n3:26:05.820 --> 3:26:07.500\n And do you wanna be healthier?\n\n3:26:07.500 --> 3:26:09.620\n And are you willing to accept some of the risks?\n\n3:26:09.620 --> 3:26:11.780\n And I think that's a discussion to have.\n\n3:26:11.780 --> 3:26:14.540\n So by the way, when you say personal drugs,\n\n3:26:14.540 --> 3:26:16.220\n do you mean the illegal ones?\n\n3:26:16.220 --> 3:26:19.820\n Or do you have a concern of just putting the manufacturer\n\n3:26:19.820 --> 3:26:22.260\n of any kind of illegal drugs\n\n3:26:22.260 --> 3:26:25.940\n in the hands of regular people?\n\n3:26:25.940 --> 3:26:28.100\n Cause they might, like dose matters.\n\n3:26:28.100 --> 3:26:29.900\n They might take way too much.\n\n3:26:29.900 --> 3:26:31.980\n I mean, I would say, to be honest,\n\n3:26:31.980 --> 3:26:34.060\n the chances of computers being,\n\n3:26:34.060 --> 3:26:35.700\n well, shouldn't always never.\n\n3:26:35.700 --> 3:26:37.540\n So the fact I can now say this means\n\n3:26:37.540 --> 3:26:39.220\n it's totally gonna come true, right?\n\n3:26:39.220 --> 3:26:40.900\n And I'm going to do it.\n\n3:26:40.900 --> 3:26:43.300\n I cannot imagine that computers will be\n\n3:26:43.300 --> 3:26:45.420\n in people's houses anytime soon,\n\n3:26:45.420 --> 3:26:48.540\n but they might be at the local pharmacy, right?\n\n3:26:48.540 --> 3:26:51.140\n And if you've got a drug manufacturing facility\n\n3:26:51.140 --> 3:26:53.580\n in every town, then you just go\n\n3:26:53.580 --> 3:26:54.700\n and they give you a prescription.\n\n3:26:54.700 --> 3:26:56.260\n They do it in such a way, they format it\n\n3:26:56.260 --> 3:26:59.380\n so that you don't have to take 10 pills every day.\n\n3:26:59.380 --> 3:27:01.940\n You get one manufactured for you\n\n3:27:01.940 --> 3:27:03.580\n that has all the materials you need\n\n3:27:03.580 --> 3:27:04.980\n and the right distribution.\n\n3:27:04.980 --> 3:27:05.820\n Got it.\n\n3:27:05.820 --> 3:27:07.300\n But you mentioned recreational drugs.\n\n3:27:07.300 --> 3:27:09.220\n And the reason I mention it,\n\n3:27:09.220 --> 3:27:12.020\n cause I know people are going to speak up on this.\n\n3:27:12.020 --> 3:27:14.820\n If the drug is legal, there's to me,\n\n3:27:14.820 --> 3:27:18.780\n no reason why you can't manufacture it for recreation.\n\n3:27:18.780 --> 3:27:19.620\n I mean, you can do it right now.\n\n3:27:19.620 --> 3:27:21.420\n What do you have against fun, Lee?\n\n3:27:22.580 --> 3:27:26.180\n I have, so I mean, I'm a chemistry professor\n\n3:27:26.180 --> 3:27:29.420\n in a university who's an entrepreneur as well.\n\n3:27:29.420 --> 3:27:31.780\n I just think I need to be as responsible\n\n3:27:31.780 --> 3:27:33.020\n as I can in the discussion.\n\n3:27:33.020 --> 3:27:35.140\n Sure, no, sure, sure.\n\n3:27:35.140 --> 3:27:37.540\n But I know, so let me be the one that says\n\n3:27:37.540 --> 3:27:40.180\n like there's nothing, cause you have said\n\n3:27:40.180 --> 3:27:44.340\n recreational drugs and like terrorism in the same sentence.\n\n3:27:44.340 --> 3:27:47.980\n I think let's make sure we draw a line\n\n3:27:47.980 --> 3:27:50.740\n that there's real dangers to the world\n\n3:27:50.740 --> 3:27:53.380\n of terrorists of bio warfare.\n\n3:27:53.380 --> 3:27:55.820\n And then there's a little bit of weed.\n\n3:27:55.820 --> 3:27:59.980\n So I haven't, I mean, I think it's up to the society\n\n3:27:59.980 --> 3:28:03.020\n to tell his governments what it wants,\n\n3:28:03.020 --> 3:28:04.740\n what's acceptable, right?\n\n3:28:04.740 --> 3:28:07.820\n And if it becomes, let's say that THCs\n\n3:28:07.820 --> 3:28:12.820\n become heavily acceptable and that you can modify them.\n\n3:28:12.860 --> 3:28:15.620\n So let's say there's, let's say it's like blood type.\n\n3:28:15.620 --> 3:28:17.380\n There's a particular type of THC\n\n3:28:17.380 --> 3:28:20.340\n that you tolerate better than I do.\n\n3:28:20.340 --> 3:28:23.540\n Then why not have a machine that makes the one you like?\n\n3:28:23.540 --> 3:28:24.380\n And then, and why not?\n\n3:28:24.380 --> 3:28:26.020\n It's the perfect brownie.\n\n3:28:26.020 --> 3:28:28.700\n Yeah, and I think that that's fine.\n\n3:28:29.620 --> 3:28:32.140\n But I'm, we're so far away from that.\n\n3:28:32.140 --> 3:28:34.500\n I can barely get the thing to work in the lab, right?\n\n3:28:34.500 --> 3:28:36.780\n And I mean, it's reliability and all this other stuff,\n\n3:28:36.780 --> 3:28:39.100\n but what I think is gonna happen in the short term,\n\n3:28:39.100 --> 3:28:43.980\n it's gonna turbocharge molecular discovery reliability\n\n3:28:43.980 --> 3:28:45.500\n and that will change the world.\n\n3:28:45.500 --> 3:28:46.980\n That's super exciting.\n\n3:28:46.980 --> 3:28:49.340\n You have a draft of a paper titled\n\n3:28:49.340 --> 3:28:50.900\n Autonomous Intelligent Exploration,\n\n3:28:50.900 --> 3:28:53.780\n Discovery and Optimization of Nanomaterials.\n\n3:28:53.780 --> 3:28:55.820\n So we are talking about\n\n3:28:55.820 --> 3:28:58.820\n automating engineering of nanomaterials.\n\n3:28:58.820 --> 3:29:01.100\n How hard is this problem?\n\n3:29:01.100 --> 3:29:04.860\n And as we continue down this thread of the positives\n\n3:29:04.860 --> 3:29:06.780\n and the worrisome,\n\n3:29:06.780 --> 3:29:09.660\n what are the things we should be excited about?\n\n3:29:09.660 --> 3:29:12.300\n And what are the things we should be terrified about?\n\n3:29:12.300 --> 3:29:13.940\n And how do we minimize the chance\n\n3:29:13.940 --> 3:29:18.060\n of the terrifying consequences?\n\n3:29:18.060 --> 3:29:21.380\n So in this robot, the robot does all the heavy lifting.\n\n3:29:21.380 --> 3:29:24.460\n So the robot basically is an embodied AI.\n\n3:29:24.460 --> 3:29:29.460\n I really like AI in a domain specific way.\n\n3:29:29.460 --> 3:29:31.460\n One of the, as you should say at this point,\n\n3:29:31.460 --> 3:29:34.260\n there was an attempt in the 60s,\n\n3:29:34.260 --> 3:29:37.300\n Joshua Leidenberg and some really important people\n\n3:29:37.300 --> 3:29:40.180\n did this that made an AI to try and guess\n\n3:29:40.180 --> 3:29:42.260\n if organic molecules and the mass spectrometer\n\n3:29:42.260 --> 3:29:43.700\n were alien or not.\n\n3:29:43.700 --> 3:29:44.740\n Yes.\n\n3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:47.660\n And they failed because they didn't have assembly theory.\n\n3:29:47.660 --> 3:29:48.820\n I see.\n\n3:29:48.820 --> 3:29:49.660\n And when I, and I, and that.\n\n3:29:49.660 --> 3:29:51.380\n Wait, what does assembly theory\n\n3:29:51.380 --> 3:29:53.540\n give you about alien versus human life?\n\n3:29:53.540 --> 3:29:55.660\n Well, no, it just, it tells you about unknown,\n\n3:29:55.660 --> 3:29:56.540\n the degree of unknowns.\n\n3:29:56.540 --> 3:29:57.500\n You can fingerprint stuff.\n\n3:29:57.500 --> 3:29:58.860\n They weren't looking at,\n\n3:29:58.860 --> 3:30:01.260\n they were trying to basically just look at the corpus\n\n3:30:01.260 --> 3:30:04.060\n of complex organic molecules.\n\n3:30:04.060 --> 3:30:06.300\n So when I was a bit down about assembly theory,\n\n3:30:06.300 --> 3:30:08.180\n cause I couldn't convince referees\n\n3:30:08.180 --> 3:30:11.980\n and couldn't convince computational people\n\n3:30:11.980 --> 3:30:14.540\n interested in computational complexity,\n\n3:30:14.540 --> 3:30:16.300\n I was really quite depressed about it.\n\n3:30:16.300 --> 3:30:20.140\n And I mean, I've been working with Sarah Walker's team\n\n3:30:20.140 --> 3:30:21.220\n and I think she, you know,\n\n3:30:21.220 --> 3:30:23.620\n I think she also invented an assembly theory somewhere.\n\n3:30:23.620 --> 3:30:25.180\n We can talk about it later.\n\n3:30:25.180 --> 3:30:30.180\n When I found the AI not working for the dendrial project,\n\n3:30:30.980 --> 3:30:34.700\n I suddenly realized I wasn't totally insane.\n\n3:30:34.700 --> 3:30:37.220\n Coming back to this nano robot.\n\n3:30:37.220 --> 3:30:40.020\n So what it does is it basically, like a computer,\n\n3:30:40.020 --> 3:30:42.980\n but now what it does is it squirts a liquid\n\n3:30:42.980 --> 3:30:45.420\n with gold in it in a test tube\n\n3:30:45.420 --> 3:30:49.660\n and it adds some reducing agents,\n\n3:30:49.660 --> 3:30:51.620\n so some electrons to make the gold\n\n3:30:51.620 --> 3:30:53.260\n turn into a nanoparticle.\n\n3:30:53.260 --> 3:30:54.820\n Now, when gold becomes a nanoparticle,\n\n3:30:54.820 --> 3:30:56.780\n it gets a characteristic color, a plasmon.\n\n3:30:56.780 --> 3:30:58.700\n So it's a bit like if you look at the sheen\n\n3:30:58.700 --> 3:31:01.220\n on the gold wedding ring or gold bar or something,\n\n3:31:01.220 --> 3:31:03.580\n those are the ways that conducting electrons\n\n3:31:03.580 --> 3:31:05.780\n basically reflect light.\n\n3:31:05.780 --> 3:31:08.540\n What we did is we randomly squirt the gold,\n\n3:31:08.540 --> 3:31:10.380\n the gold particle and the reducing agent\n\n3:31:10.380 --> 3:31:13.460\n and then we measure the UV, we measure the color.\n\n3:31:13.460 --> 3:31:16.820\n And so what we do is we've got, the robot has a mind.\n\n3:31:16.820 --> 3:31:20.300\n So it has a mind where in a simulation,\n\n3:31:20.300 --> 3:31:23.820\n it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon,\n\n3:31:23.820 --> 3:31:27.300\n the color that comes out, randomly imagines in its head.\n\n3:31:27.300 --> 3:31:28.340\n It then with the others,\n\n3:31:28.340 --> 3:31:29.820\n that's the imaginary side of the robot.\n\n3:31:29.820 --> 3:31:30.860\n In the physical side of the robot,\n\n3:31:30.860 --> 3:31:34.620\n it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color\n\n3:31:34.620 --> 3:31:36.380\n and it uses a genetic algorithm\n\n3:31:36.380 --> 3:31:38.660\n and a map elite actually on it.\n\n3:31:38.660 --> 3:31:41.820\n And it goes around in cycles and refines\n\n3:31:43.180 --> 3:31:45.340\n the color to the objective.\n\n3:31:45.340 --> 3:31:46.740\n Now we use two different points.\n\n3:31:46.740 --> 3:31:50.300\n We have an exploration and an optimization.\n\n3:31:50.300 --> 3:31:51.140\n They're two different.\n\n3:31:51.140 --> 3:31:54.420\n So the exploration just says, just do random stuff\n\n3:31:54.420 --> 3:31:55.940\n and see how many different things you can get.\n\n3:31:55.940 --> 3:31:57.460\n And when you get different things,\n\n3:31:57.460 --> 3:32:00.740\n try and optimize and make the peak sharper, sharper, sharper.\n\n3:32:00.740 --> 3:32:03.180\n And what it does after a number of cycles\n\n3:32:03.180 --> 3:32:05.380\n is it physically takes a sample\n\n3:32:05.380 --> 3:32:07.820\n of the optimized nanomaterial,\n\n3:32:07.820 --> 3:32:10.980\n resets all of the round bottom flasks, cleans them\n\n3:32:10.980 --> 3:32:14.620\n and puts the seed, physical seed back in.\n\n3:32:14.620 --> 3:32:16.220\n And then what this robot is able to do\n\n3:32:16.220 --> 3:32:20.580\n is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions\n\n3:32:20.580 --> 3:32:23.020\n in just a thousand experiments in three days.\n\n3:32:24.180 --> 3:32:26.540\n And it makes five generations of nanoparticles\n\n3:32:26.540 --> 3:32:28.580\n which get nicer and nicer in terms of shape\n\n3:32:28.580 --> 3:32:30.140\n and color and definition.\n\n3:32:30.140 --> 3:32:33.100\n And then at the end, it outputs a Kydl code.\n\n3:32:33.100 --> 3:32:34.020\n That could then be.\n\n3:32:34.020 --> 3:32:38.220\n Wow, it's doing the search for programs\n\n3:32:38.220 --> 3:32:39.700\n in the physical space.\n\n3:32:39.700 --> 3:32:42.620\n So it's doing a kind of reinforcement learning.\n\n3:32:42.620 --> 3:32:44.180\n Yeah, yeah, in the physical space.\n\n3:32:44.180 --> 3:32:46.580\n With the exploration and the optimization.\n\n3:32:46.580 --> 3:32:48.740\n And that Kydl will work on any computer\n\n3:32:48.740 --> 3:32:49.580\n or any qualified hardware.\n\n3:32:49.580 --> 3:32:50.940\n So now that's it.\n\n3:32:50.940 --> 3:32:53.220\n That's now that's a general piece of code\n\n3:32:53.220 --> 3:32:57.940\n that can replicate somewhat maybe perfectly\n\n3:32:57.940 --> 3:32:58.980\n what it created.\n\n3:32:58.980 --> 3:32:59.820\n That's amazing.\n\n3:32:59.820 --> 3:33:00.660\n That's incredible.\n\n3:33:00.660 --> 3:33:02.220\n But the nanoparticles themselves are done.\n\n3:33:02.220 --> 3:33:03.580\n The robot has all the thinking.\n\n3:33:03.580 --> 3:33:06.660\n So we don't try and imply any self replication\n\n3:33:06.660 --> 3:33:09.740\n or try and get the particles to make themselves.\n\n3:33:09.740 --> 3:33:11.540\n Although it would be cool to try.\n\n3:33:11.540 --> 3:33:13.060\n So, well, there you go.\n\n3:33:13.060 --> 3:33:14.980\n That's, those are famous last words\n\n3:33:14.980 --> 3:33:16.820\n for the end of human civilization.\n\n3:33:16.820 --> 3:33:17.900\n Would be cool to try.\n\n3:33:17.900 --> 3:33:21.420\n So is it possible to create molecules\n\n3:33:21.420 --> 3:33:24.820\n that start approaching this question\n\n3:33:24.820 --> 3:33:26.580\n that we started this conversation,\n\n3:33:26.580 --> 3:33:29.540\n which is the origin of life.\n\n3:33:29.540 --> 3:33:33.980\n To start to create molecules that have lifelike qualities.\n\n3:33:33.980 --> 3:33:37.740\n So have the replication, have like complex,\n\n3:33:37.740 --> 3:33:40.140\n start to create complex organisms.\n\n3:33:40.140 --> 3:33:42.020\n So we have done this with the oxides.\n\n3:33:42.020 --> 3:33:43.900\n I talked about earlier with the moxides\n\n3:33:43.900 --> 3:33:45.740\n and the rings and the bulls.\n\n3:33:45.740 --> 3:33:48.340\n And the problem is that, well, they do,\n\n3:33:49.300 --> 3:33:52.020\n they auto catalytically enhance one another.\n\n3:33:52.020 --> 3:33:55.780\n So they would, I guess you would call it self replication.\n\n3:33:55.780 --> 3:34:00.780\n But because there's limited function and mutation,\n\n3:34:01.900 --> 3:34:02.740\n they're pretty dumb.\n\n3:34:02.740 --> 3:34:04.540\n So they don't do very much.\n\n3:34:04.540 --> 3:34:09.540\n So I think the prospect of us being able to engineer\n\n3:34:10.340 --> 3:34:13.700\n a nano material life form in the short term,\n\n3:34:13.700 --> 3:34:14.780\n like I said earlier,\n\n3:34:14.780 --> 3:34:16.420\n my aim is to do this, of course.\n\n3:34:16.420 --> 3:34:18.460\n I mean, on one hand, I'm saying it's impossible.\n\n3:34:18.460 --> 3:34:19.540\n On the other hand, I'm saying I'm doing it.\n\n3:34:19.540 --> 3:34:20.380\n So which is it, Lee?\n\n3:34:20.380 --> 3:34:23.700\n It's like, well, I think we can do it,\n\n3:34:23.700 --> 3:34:24.940\n but only in the robot.\n\n3:34:24.940 --> 3:34:27.500\n So the causal chain that's gonna allow it is in the robot.\n\n3:34:27.500 --> 3:34:30.020\n These particles, if they do start to self replicate,\n\n3:34:30.020 --> 3:34:32.300\n the system's gonna be so fragile\n\n3:34:32.300 --> 3:34:35.940\n that I don't think anything dangerous will come out.\n\n3:34:35.940 --> 3:34:38.220\n It doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them\n\n3:34:38.220 --> 3:34:42.260\n as potentially, I mean, I don't want to scare people\n\n3:34:42.260 --> 3:34:43.220\n like gain of function.\n\n3:34:43.220 --> 3:34:45.140\n We're gonna produce stuff that comes out.\n\n3:34:45.140 --> 3:34:48.060\n Our number one kill switch is that we always try\n\n3:34:48.060 --> 3:34:52.460\n to search a space of objects\n\n3:34:52.460 --> 3:34:55.820\n that don't exist in the environment.\n\n3:34:55.820 --> 3:34:58.540\n So even if something got out, it just would die immediately.\n\n3:34:58.540 --> 3:35:01.060\n It's like making a silicon life form or something.\n\n3:35:02.100 --> 3:35:04.340\n Which is the opposite of oftentimes\n\n3:35:04.340 --> 3:35:06.420\n gain of function research is focused on\n\n3:35:06.420 --> 3:35:09.340\n how do you get a dangerous thing\n\n3:35:09.340 --> 3:35:11.700\n to be closer to something that works with humans?\n\n3:35:11.700 --> 3:35:12.540\n Yeah.\n\n3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:13.460\n To have it jump to humans.\n\n3:35:13.460 --> 3:35:16.860\n So that's the one good mode to operate on\n\n3:35:16.860 --> 3:35:21.860\n is always try to operate on chemical entities\n\n3:35:22.100 --> 3:35:25.220\n that are very different than the kind of chemical environment\n\n3:35:25.220 --> 3:35:26.300\n that humans operate in.\n\n3:35:26.300 --> 3:35:29.580\n Yeah, and also, I mean, I'll say something dramatic,\n\n3:35:29.580 --> 3:35:33.260\n which may not be true.\n\n3:35:33.260 --> 3:35:35.140\n So I should be careful.\n\n3:35:35.140 --> 3:35:39.100\n If let's say we did discover a new living system\n\n3:35:39.100 --> 3:35:42.860\n but it was made out of a shadow biosphere\n\n3:35:42.860 --> 3:35:44.540\n and we just released it in the environment,\n\n3:35:44.540 --> 3:35:45.380\n who cares?\n\n3:35:45.380 --> 3:35:46.900\n It's gonna use different stuff.\n\n3:35:48.260 --> 3:35:50.380\n Yeah, it'll just live.\n\n3:35:50.380 --> 3:35:51.620\n Just live, yeah.\n\n3:35:51.620 --> 3:35:53.820\n I found one of my biggest fantasies\n\n3:35:53.820 --> 3:35:55.780\n is actually is like a planet\n\n3:35:55.780 --> 3:35:57.260\n that's basically half in the sun,\n\n3:35:57.260 --> 3:35:59.100\n it doesn't rotate, right?\n\n3:35:59.100 --> 3:36:02.220\n And you have two different origins of life on that planet\n\n3:36:03.300 --> 3:36:05.140\n and they don't share the same chemistry.\n\n3:36:05.140 --> 3:36:05.980\n Yeah.\n\n3:36:05.980 --> 3:36:08.100\n And then the only way time they recognize each other\n\n3:36:08.100 --> 3:36:09.660\n is when they become intelligent, they go,\n\n3:36:09.660 --> 3:36:10.660\n well, what's that moving?\n\n3:36:10.660 --> 3:36:11.500\n Yeah.\n\n3:36:12.460 --> 3:36:14.780\n So they co evolve and that's fascinating.\n\n3:36:14.780 --> 3:36:17.500\n I mean, so one fascinating thing to do\n\n3:36:17.500 --> 3:36:20.820\n is exactly what you were saying, which is a life bomb,\n\n3:36:20.820 --> 3:36:25.820\n which is like try to focus on atmospheres\n\n3:36:25.940 --> 3:36:29.740\n or chemical conditions of other planets\n\n3:36:29.740 --> 3:36:34.740\n and try within this kind of exploration optimization system\n\n3:36:34.740 --> 3:36:39.740\n try to discover life forms that can work in those conditions\n\n3:36:40.380 --> 3:36:43.060\n and then you send those life forms over there\n\n3:36:43.060 --> 3:36:44.860\n and see what kind of stuff they build up.\n\n3:36:44.860 --> 3:36:47.260\n Like you can do like a large scale,\n\n3:36:47.260 --> 3:36:50.300\n it's kind of a safe physical environment\n\n3:36:50.300 --> 3:36:53.180\n to do large scale experiments, it's another planet.\n\n3:36:53.180 --> 3:36:55.780\n Yeah, so look, I'm gonna say something quite contentious.\n\n3:36:55.780 --> 3:36:57.580\n I mean, Elon wants to go to Mars,\n\n3:36:57.580 --> 3:36:59.020\n I think it's brilliant wants to go to Mars,\n\n3:36:59.020 --> 3:37:01.060\n but I would counter that and say,\n\n3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:03.620\n is Elon just obsessed with getting humanity?\n\n3:37:03.620 --> 3:37:06.740\n Or Earth, or what about just technology?\n\n3:37:06.740 --> 3:37:09.500\n So if we do technology, so Elon either needs\n\n3:37:09.500 --> 3:37:10.540\n to take a computer to Mars\n\n3:37:10.540 --> 3:37:12.860\n because he needs to manufacture drugs on demand,\n\n3:37:12.860 --> 3:37:16.140\n because zero cost payload and all that stuff is just code.\n\n3:37:16.140 --> 3:37:18.860\n Or what we do is we actually say, hang on,\n\n3:37:18.860 --> 3:37:21.220\n it's quite hard for humans to survive on Mars.\n\n3:37:21.220 --> 3:37:24.180\n Why don't we write a series of origin of life algorithms\n\n3:37:24.180 --> 3:37:26.220\n where we embed our culture in it?\n\n3:37:26.220 --> 3:37:28.860\n It's a very Ridley spot Prometheus,\n\n3:37:28.860 --> 3:37:31.380\n which is a terrible film by the way, but anyway.\n\n3:37:31.380 --> 3:37:36.380\n And dump it on Mars and just terraform Mars.\n\n3:37:37.300 --> 3:37:39.660\n And what we do is we evolve life on Mars\n\n3:37:39.660 --> 3:37:42.180\n that is suited to life on Mars,\n\n3:37:42.180 --> 3:37:44.660\n rather than brute forcing human life on Mars.\n\n3:37:44.660 --> 3:37:48.580\n So one of the questions is, what is human culture?\n\n3:37:48.580 --> 3:37:50.180\n What are the things you encode?\n\n3:37:50.180 --> 3:37:52.660\n Some of it is knowledge, some of it is information.\n\n3:37:52.660 --> 3:37:55.220\n But the thing that Elon talks about,\n\n3:37:55.220 --> 3:37:58.700\n the thing I think about, I think you think about as well\n\n3:37:58.700 --> 3:38:03.700\n is some of the more unique aspects of what makes us human,\n\n3:38:06.460 --> 3:38:09.820\n which is our particular kind of consciousness.\n\n3:38:09.820 --> 3:38:13.260\n So he talks about the flame of human consciousness.\n\n3:38:13.260 --> 3:38:15.180\n That's one of the questions is,\n\n3:38:15.180 --> 3:38:20.180\n can we instill consciousness into other beings?\n\n3:38:22.180 --> 3:38:26.940\n Because that's a sad thought that whatever this thing\n\n3:38:26.940 --> 3:38:30.100\n inside our minds, that hopes and dreams and fears\n\n3:38:30.100 --> 3:38:33.060\n and loves can all die.\n\n3:38:33.940 --> 3:38:35.300\n Yeah, but I think you already know\n\n3:38:35.300 --> 3:38:37.540\n the answer to that question.\n\n3:38:37.540 --> 3:38:40.180\n I have a robot lawnmower at home.\n\n3:38:40.180 --> 3:38:42.380\n My kids call it CC, cool car.\n\n3:38:42.380 --> 3:38:44.740\n It's a robo mower.\n\n3:38:44.740 --> 3:38:47.060\n And the way it works, it has an electric field\n\n3:38:47.060 --> 3:38:49.940\n around the perimeter and it just tell it the area.\n\n3:38:49.940 --> 3:38:52.860\n And it goes out and goes from its base station,\n\n3:38:52.860 --> 3:38:54.220\n just mows a bit.\n\n3:38:54.220 --> 3:38:55.980\n Gets to the perimeter, detects perimeter,\n\n3:38:55.980 --> 3:38:58.900\n then chooses a random angle, rotates around and goes on.\n\n3:38:58.900 --> 3:39:00.420\n Yeah.\n\n3:39:00.420 --> 3:39:02.020\n My kids call it cool cutter.\n\n3:39:02.020 --> 3:39:02.860\n It's a she.\n\n3:39:02.860 --> 3:39:03.820\n I don't know why it's a she.\n\n3:39:03.820 --> 3:39:05.420\n They just, when they were like quite young,\n\n3:39:05.420 --> 3:39:08.420\n they called it, I don't want to be sexist there.\n\n3:39:08.420 --> 3:39:10.020\n It could be a he, but they liked.\n\n3:39:11.860 --> 3:39:13.180\n They gendered the lawnmower?\n\n3:39:13.180 --> 3:39:14.140\n They gendered the lawnmower.\n\n3:39:14.140 --> 3:39:14.980\n Okay.\n\n3:39:14.980 --> 3:39:15.820\n Yeah, why not?\n\n3:39:15.820 --> 3:39:17.820\n But I was thinking this lawnmower,\n\n3:39:17.820 --> 3:39:20.540\n if you apply integrated information theory to lawnmower,\n\n3:39:20.540 --> 3:39:22.660\n the lawnmower is conscious.\n\n3:39:22.660 --> 3:39:26.420\n Now, integrated information theory is,\n\n3:39:26.420 --> 3:39:28.220\n people say it's a flawed way of measuring consciousness,\n\n3:39:28.220 --> 3:39:29.060\n but I don't think it is.\n\n3:39:29.060 --> 3:39:32.060\n I think assembly theory actually measures consciousness\n\n3:39:32.060 --> 3:39:33.220\n in the same way.\n\n3:39:33.220 --> 3:39:35.900\n Consciousness is something that is generated\n\n3:39:35.900 --> 3:39:38.820\n over a population of objects, of humans.\n\n3:39:38.820 --> 3:39:40.980\n Consciousness didn't suddenly spring in.\n\n3:39:40.980 --> 3:39:43.180\n Our consciousness has evolved together, right?\n\n3:39:43.180 --> 3:39:45.980\n The fact we're here and the robots we leave behind,\n\n3:39:45.980 --> 3:39:47.180\n they will have some of that.\n\n3:39:47.180 --> 3:39:49.100\n So we won't lose it all.\n\n3:39:49.100 --> 3:39:50.900\n Sure, consciousness requires\n\n3:39:50.900 --> 3:39:52.860\n that we have many models being generated.\n\n3:39:52.860 --> 3:39:55.180\n It's not just one domain specific AI, right?\n\n3:39:55.180 --> 3:39:57.420\n I think the way to create consciousness,\n\n3:39:57.420 --> 3:39:58.660\n I'm going to say unashamedly,\n\n3:39:58.660 --> 3:40:02.820\n the best way to make a consciousness is in a chemical system\n\n3:40:02.820 --> 3:40:05.300\n because you just have access to many more states.\n\n3:40:05.300 --> 3:40:06.260\n And the problem right now,\n\n3:40:06.260 --> 3:40:08.580\n we're making silicon consciousness\n\n3:40:08.580 --> 3:40:10.860\n because you just don't have enough states.\n\n3:40:10.860 --> 3:40:12.740\n So there are more possible states,\n\n3:40:12.740 --> 3:40:14.980\n or sorry, there are more possible configurations possible\n\n3:40:14.980 --> 3:40:17.940\n in your brain than there are atoms in the universe.\n\n3:40:17.940 --> 3:40:20.500\n And you can switch between them.\n\n3:40:20.500 --> 3:40:22.780\n You can't do that on a core I10.\n\n3:40:22.780 --> 3:40:25.300\n It's got 10 billion, 12 billion, 14 billion transistors,\n\n3:40:25.300 --> 3:40:28.340\n but you can't reconfigure them as dynamically.\n\n3:40:28.340 --> 3:40:31.420\n Well, you've shared this intuition a few times already\n\n3:40:31.420 --> 3:40:34.660\n that the larger number of states\n\n3:40:34.660 --> 3:40:38.420\n somehow correlates to greater possibility of life,\n\n3:40:38.420 --> 3:40:42.380\n but it's also possible the constraints are essential here.\n\n3:40:42.380 --> 3:40:43.420\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n3:40:43.420 --> 3:40:45.620\n I mean, but coming back to the,\n\n3:40:45.620 --> 3:40:46.820\n you worry that something's lost.\n\n3:40:46.820 --> 3:40:51.820\n I agree, but I think that we will get to an AGI,\n\n3:40:53.780 --> 3:40:56.220\n but I wonder if it's not,\n\n3:40:56.220 --> 3:40:58.300\n it can't be separate from human,\n\n3:40:58.300 --> 3:41:00.100\n it can't be separate from human consciousness\n\n3:41:00.100 --> 3:41:03.060\n because the causal chain that produced it came from humans.\n\n3:41:03.060 --> 3:41:06.380\n So what I kind of try and suggest heavily\n\n3:41:06.380 --> 3:41:11.380\n to people worry about the existential threat of AI saying,\n\n3:41:11.540 --> 3:41:13.460\n I mean, you put it much more elegantly earlier,\n\n3:41:13.460 --> 3:41:16.820\n like we should worry about algorithms on, dumb algorithms\n\n3:41:16.820 --> 3:41:21.140\n written by human beings on Twitter driving us insane, right?\n\n3:41:21.140 --> 3:41:23.260\n And doing acting in odd ways.\n\n3:41:23.260 --> 3:41:24.940\n Yeah, I think intelligence,\n\n3:41:24.940 --> 3:41:27.100\n this is what I have been in eloquent\n\n3:41:27.100 --> 3:41:30.620\n in trying to describe it partially\n\n3:41:30.620 --> 3:41:34.940\n because I try not to think too deeply through this stuff\n\n3:41:34.940 --> 3:41:36.260\n because then you become a philosopher.\n\n3:41:36.260 --> 3:41:40.460\n I still aspire to actually building a bunch of stuff.\n\n3:41:40.460 --> 3:41:44.580\n But my sense is super intelligence leads\n\n3:41:44.580 --> 3:41:48.780\n to deep integration to human society.\n\n3:41:48.780 --> 3:41:51.980\n So like intelligence is strongly correlated.\n\n3:41:51.980 --> 3:41:56.980\n Like intelligence, the way we conceive of intelligence\n\n3:41:56.980 --> 3:42:01.980\n materializes as a thing that becomes a fun entity\n\n3:42:03.300 --> 3:42:06.420\n to have at a party and with humans.\n\n3:42:06.420 --> 3:42:09.980\n So like it's a mix of wit, intelligence, humor,\n\n3:42:09.980 --> 3:42:11.740\n like intelligence, like knowledge,\n\n3:42:11.740 --> 3:42:14.340\n ability to do reasoning and so on,\n\n3:42:14.340 --> 3:42:17.980\n but also humor, emotional intelligence,\n\n3:42:17.980 --> 3:42:22.980\n ability to love, to dream, to share those dreams,\n\n3:42:23.460 --> 3:42:28.060\n to play the game of human civilization,\n\n3:42:28.060 --> 3:42:30.100\n the push and pull, the whole dance of it,\n\n3:42:30.100 --> 3:42:31.380\n the whole dance of life.\n\n3:42:31.380 --> 3:42:35.420\n And I think that kind of super intelligent being\n\n3:42:35.420 --> 3:42:38.140\n is not the thing that worries me.\n\n3:42:38.140 --> 3:42:41.140\n I think that ultimately will enrich life.\n\n3:42:41.140 --> 3:42:43.060\n It's again, the dumb algorithms,\n\n3:42:43.060 --> 3:42:46.620\n the dumb algorithms that scale in the hands of people\n\n3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:48.860\n that are too, don't study history,\n\n3:42:48.860 --> 3:42:51.820\n that don't study human psychology and human nature,\n\n3:42:51.820 --> 3:42:56.820\n just applying too broadly for selfish near term interests.\n\n3:42:57.020 --> 3:42:58.500\n That's the biggest danger.\n\n3:42:58.500 --> 3:43:01.420\n Yeah, I think it's not a new danger, right?\n\n3:43:01.420 --> 3:43:04.660\n I now know how I should use Twitter\n\n3:43:04.660 --> 3:43:07.500\n and how I shouldn't use Twitter, right?\n\n3:43:07.500 --> 3:43:09.620\n I like to provoke people into thinking.\n\n3:43:09.620 --> 3:43:11.580\n I don't want to provoke people into outrage.\n\n3:43:11.580 --> 3:43:12.420\n It's not fun.\n\n3:43:12.420 --> 3:43:14.620\n It's not a good thing for humans to do, right?\n\n3:43:14.620 --> 3:43:16.740\n And I think that when you get people into outrage,\n\n3:43:16.740 --> 3:43:20.060\n they take sides and taking sides is really bad.\n\n3:43:20.060 --> 3:43:22.100\n But I think that we're all beginning to see this.\n\n3:43:22.100 --> 3:43:24.820\n And I think that actually I'm very optimistic\n\n3:43:24.820 --> 3:43:28.580\n about how things will evolve because, you know,\n\n3:43:28.580 --> 3:43:32.020\n I wonder how much productivity has Twitter\n\n3:43:32.020 --> 3:43:33.820\n and social media taken out of humanity?\n\n3:43:33.820 --> 3:43:36.620\n Because how many now, I mean,\n\n3:43:36.620 --> 3:43:38.980\n so the good thing about Twitter is it gives power,\n\n3:43:38.980 --> 3:43:41.300\n so it gives voice to minorities, right?\n\n3:43:41.300 --> 3:43:44.220\n And that's good to some degree.\n\n3:43:44.220 --> 3:43:47.460\n But I wonder how much voice does it give\n\n3:43:47.460 --> 3:43:52.460\n to all sorts of other problems\n\n3:43:52.460 --> 3:43:54.300\n that don't need this emerge?\n\n3:43:54.300 --> 3:43:55.820\n By the way, when you say minorities,\n\n3:43:55.820 --> 3:44:00.020\n I think, or at least if I were to agree with you,\n\n3:44:00.020 --> 3:44:02.380\n what I would say is minorities broadly defined\n\n3:44:02.380 --> 3:44:07.380\n in these small groups of people that it magnifies\n\n3:44:09.580 --> 3:44:12.900\n the concerns of the small versus the big.\n\n3:44:12.900 --> 3:44:14.620\n That is good to some degree.\n\n3:44:15.660 --> 3:44:17.980\n But I think, I mean, I have to be careful\n\n3:44:17.980 --> 3:44:20.940\n because I think I have a very,\n\n3:44:20.940 --> 3:44:23.420\n I mean, I think that the world isn't that broken, right?\n\n3:44:23.420 --> 3:44:25.100\n I think the world is pretty cool place.\n\n3:44:25.100 --> 3:44:26.980\n I think academia is really great.\n\n3:44:26.980 --> 3:44:29.980\n I think climate change presents\n\n3:44:29.980 --> 3:44:32.380\n a really interesting problem for humanity\n\n3:44:32.380 --> 3:44:33.500\n that we will solve.\n\n3:44:33.500 --> 3:44:34.340\n I like how you said it.\n\n3:44:34.340 --> 3:44:37.540\n It's a pretty cool problem for civilization.\n\n3:44:37.540 --> 3:44:38.460\n It's a big one.\n\n3:44:38.460 --> 3:44:39.300\n Well, it's a bunch of it.\n\n3:44:39.300 --> 3:44:42.620\n There's a bunch of really, really big problems\n\n3:44:42.620 --> 3:44:45.940\n that if solved can significantly improve\n\n3:44:45.940 --> 3:44:47.540\n the quality of life or learn.\n\n3:44:47.540 --> 3:44:49.580\n That ultimately is what we're trying to do,\n\n3:44:49.580 --> 3:44:51.700\n improve how awesome life is\n\n3:44:51.700 --> 3:44:53.420\n for the maximum number of people.\n\n3:44:53.420 --> 3:44:56.620\n Yeah, and I think that the coming back to consciousness,\n\n3:44:56.620 --> 3:45:00.300\n I don't think the universe is doomed to heat death, right?\n\n3:45:00.300 --> 3:45:01.460\n It's one of the optimists.\n\n3:45:01.460 --> 3:45:03.300\n That's why I want to kind of nudge you\n\n3:45:03.300 --> 3:45:04.740\n into thinking that time is fundamental\n\n3:45:04.740 --> 3:45:05.860\n because if time is fundamental,\n\n3:45:05.860 --> 3:45:09.180\n then suddenly you don't have to give it back.\n\n3:45:09.180 --> 3:45:11.460\n The universe just constructs stuff.\n\n3:45:11.460 --> 3:45:13.260\n And what we see around us in our construction,\n\n3:45:13.260 --> 3:45:16.060\n I know everyone's worried about how fragile civilization is.\n\n3:45:16.060 --> 3:45:17.740\n And I mean, look at the fundamentals.\n\n3:45:17.740 --> 3:45:22.020\n We're good until the sun expands, right?\n\n3:45:22.020 --> 3:45:23.780\n We've got quite a lot of resource on earth.\n\n3:45:23.780 --> 3:45:25.700\n We're trying to be quite cooperative.\n\n3:45:25.700 --> 3:45:27.780\n Humans are nice to each other\n\n3:45:27.780 --> 3:45:31.860\n when they're not under enormous stress.\n\n3:45:31.860 --> 3:45:33.780\n But coming back to the consciousness thing,\n\n3:45:33.780 --> 3:45:36.620\n are we going to send human beings to Mars\n\n3:45:36.620 --> 3:45:38.420\n or conscious robots to Mars?\n\n3:45:38.420 --> 3:45:40.460\n Or are we gonna send some hybrid?\n\n3:45:40.460 --> 3:45:43.340\n And I don't know the answer to that question right now.\n\n3:45:43.340 --> 3:45:44.660\n I guess, you know,\n\n3:45:44.660 --> 3:45:46.500\n Elon is gonna have a pretty good go at getting there.\n\n3:45:46.500 --> 3:45:47.620\n I'm not sure whether,\n\n3:45:49.740 --> 3:45:52.980\n I have my doubts, but I'm not qualified.\n\n3:45:52.980 --> 3:45:56.700\n I'm sure people have their doubts that computation works,\n\n3:45:56.700 --> 3:45:58.260\n but I've got it working.\n\n3:45:58.260 --> 3:45:59.300\n And I, you know.\n\n3:45:59.300 --> 3:46:02.740\n And most of the cool technologies we have today\n\n3:46:03.660 --> 3:46:05.740\n and take for granted,\n\n3:46:05.740 --> 3:46:08.540\n like the airplane, a aforementioned airplane,\n\n3:46:08.540 --> 3:46:11.260\n were things that people doubted.\n\n3:46:11.260 --> 3:46:13.060\n Like majority of people doubted\n\n3:46:13.060 --> 3:46:16.100\n before they came to life and they come to life.\n\n3:46:16.100 --> 3:46:19.140\n And speaking of hybrid AI and humans,\n\n3:46:19.140 --> 3:46:21.500\n it's fascinating to think about all the different ways\n\n3:46:21.500 --> 3:46:25.060\n that hybridization, that merger can happen.\n\n3:46:25.060 --> 3:46:27.300\n I mean, we have, currently have the smartphone,\n\n3:46:27.300 --> 3:46:28.500\n so there's already a hybrid,\n\n3:46:28.500 --> 3:46:31.420\n but there's all kinds of ways that hybrid happens.\n\n3:46:31.420 --> 3:46:34.380\n How we and other technology play together,\n\n3:46:34.380 --> 3:46:37.460\n like a computer, how that changes\n\n3:46:37.460 --> 3:46:40.740\n the fabric of human civilization is like wide open.\n\n3:46:40.740 --> 3:46:41.620\n Who knows?\n\n3:46:41.620 --> 3:46:42.540\n Who knows?\n\n3:46:42.540 --> 3:46:43.780\n If you remove,\n\n3:46:46.060 --> 3:46:47.740\n if you remove cancer,\n\n3:46:47.740 --> 3:46:52.460\n if you remove major diseases from humanity,\n\n3:46:53.980 --> 3:46:55.620\n there's going to be a bunch of consequences\n\n3:46:55.620 --> 3:46:57.140\n we're not anticipating.\n\n3:46:57.140 --> 3:47:01.100\n Many of them positive, but many of them negative.\n\n3:47:01.100 --> 3:47:04.100\n Many of them, most of them, at least I hope,\n\n3:47:04.100 --> 3:47:06.580\n are weird and wonderful and fun\n\n3:47:06.580 --> 3:47:08.740\n in ways that are totally unexpected.\n\n3:47:08.740 --> 3:47:11.780\n And we sitting on a porch with a bottle of Jack Daniels\n\n3:47:11.780 --> 3:47:13.620\n and a rocker will say,\n\n3:47:13.620 --> 3:47:15.220\n kids these days don't appreciate\n\n3:47:15.220 --> 3:47:17.180\n how hard we had it back in the day.\n\n3:47:17.180 --> 3:47:21.260\n I gotta ask you, speaking of nudging,\n\n3:47:21.260 --> 3:47:25.860\n you and Joscha Bach nudge each other on Twitter quite a bit\n\n3:47:25.860 --> 3:47:29.380\n in wonderful intellectual debates.\n\n3:47:29.380 --> 3:47:31.340\n And of course, for people who don't know Joscha Bach,\n\n3:47:31.340 --> 3:47:32.300\n he's this brilliant guy.\n\n3:47:32.300 --> 3:47:34.300\n He's been on the podcast a couple times.\n\n3:47:35.260 --> 3:47:38.780\n You tweeted, or he tweeted,\n\n3:47:38.780 --> 3:47:41.100\n Joscha Bach, everyone should follow him as well.\n\n3:47:41.100 --> 3:47:44.420\n You should definitely follow Mr. Lee Cronin, Dr. Lee Cronin.\n\n3:47:44.420 --> 3:47:48.140\n He tweeted, dinner with Lee Cronin.\n\n3:47:48.140 --> 3:47:50.860\n We discussed that while we can translate\n\n3:47:50.860 --> 3:47:54.420\n every working model of existence into a Turing machine,\n\n3:47:54.420 --> 3:47:56.780\n the structure of the universe might be given\n\n3:47:56.780 --> 3:47:59.660\n by weeks of nonexistence in a pattern generated\n\n3:47:59.660 --> 3:48:04.220\n by all possible automata, which exist by default.\n\n3:48:05.780 --> 3:48:09.900\n And then he followed on saying face to face is the best.\n\n3:48:09.900 --> 3:48:12.140\n So the dinner was face to face.\n\n3:48:12.140 --> 3:48:16.460\n What is Joscha talking about in weeks, quote,\n\n3:48:16.460 --> 3:48:19.820\n weeks of nonexistence in a pattern generated\n\n3:48:19.820 --> 3:48:24.820\n by all possible automata, which exist by default.\n\n3:48:25.460 --> 3:48:29.820\n So automata exist by default, apparently.\n\n3:48:29.820 --> 3:48:31.740\n And then there's weeks of nonexistence.\n\n3:48:31.740 --> 3:48:34.900\n What the hell is nonexistence in the universe?\n\n3:48:34.900 --> 3:48:39.340\n That's, and also in another conversation,\n\n3:48:39.340 --> 3:48:44.340\n you tweeted it's state machines all the way down,\n\n3:48:44.460 --> 3:48:47.820\n which presumably is the origin story of this discussion.\n\n3:48:47.820 --> 3:48:52.820\n And then Joscha said, again, nudging, nudging,\n\n3:48:53.220 --> 3:48:56.460\n nudging slash trolling, Joscha said,\n\n3:48:56.460 --> 3:48:59.260\n you've seen the light, welcome friend.\n\n3:48:59.260 --> 3:49:01.660\n Many foundational physicists effectively believe\n\n3:49:01.660 --> 3:49:04.420\n in some form of hyper computation.\n\n3:49:04.420 --> 3:49:07.060\n Lee is coming around to this idea.\n\n3:49:07.060 --> 3:49:10.220\n And then you said, I think there are notable differences.\n\n3:49:10.220 --> 3:49:13.100\n First, I think the universe does not have to be a computer.\n\n3:49:13.100 --> 3:49:16.820\n Second, I want to understand how the universe emerges,\n\n3:49:16.820 --> 3:49:18.460\n constructors that build computers.\n\n3:49:18.460 --> 3:49:23.460\n And third is that there is something below church touring.\n\n3:49:24.980 --> 3:49:29.980\n Okay, what the heck is this dinner conversation about?\n\n3:49:30.780 --> 3:49:34.700\n Maybe put another way, maybe zooming out a little bit.\n\n3:49:34.700 --> 3:49:37.020\n Are there interesting agreements or disagreements\n\n3:49:37.020 --> 3:49:41.540\n between you and Joscha Bach that can elucidate\n\n3:49:41.540 --> 3:49:44.060\n some of the other topics we've been talking about?\n\n3:49:44.060 --> 3:49:46.100\n Yeah, so Jascha has an incredible mind\n\n3:49:46.100 --> 3:49:48.700\n and he has, he's so well read\n\n3:49:49.940 --> 3:49:53.300\n and uses language really elegantly.\n\n3:49:53.300 --> 3:49:54.820\n It bamboozles me at times.\n\n3:49:54.820 --> 3:49:59.340\n So I'm, so often I'm using, I'm describing concepts\n\n3:49:59.340 --> 3:50:03.140\n in a way that I built from the ground up.\n\n3:50:03.140 --> 3:50:05.300\n And so we misunderstand each other a lot.\n\n3:50:05.300 --> 3:50:08.180\n And he's floating in the clouds, is that what you're saying?\n\n3:50:08.180 --> 3:50:09.780\n Something like, not quite, but I think,\n\n3:50:09.780 --> 3:50:11.620\n so this concept of a Turing machine.\n\n3:50:11.620 --> 3:50:15.420\n So a Turing machine, Turing machines, I would argue,\n\n3:50:15.420 --> 3:50:18.500\n and I think this is not, the Turing machine,\n\n3:50:18.500 --> 3:50:21.020\n the universe is not a Turing machine.\n\n3:50:21.020 --> 3:50:23.220\n Biology is not even a Turing machine, right?\n\n3:50:23.220 --> 3:50:25.620\n And because Turing machines don't evolve, right?\n\n3:50:25.620 --> 3:50:27.020\n There is this problem\n\n3:50:27.020 --> 3:50:28.620\n that people see Turing machines everywhere,\n\n3:50:28.620 --> 3:50:31.580\n but isn't it interesting the universe gave rise to biology\n\n3:50:31.580 --> 3:50:32.820\n that gave rise to intelligence,\n\n3:50:32.820 --> 3:50:34.420\n that gave rise to Alan Turing,\n\n3:50:34.420 --> 3:50:37.060\n who invented the abstraction of the Turing machine\n\n3:50:37.060 --> 3:50:39.580\n and allowed us to digitize.\n\n3:50:39.580 --> 3:50:43.340\n And so I've been looking for the mystery\n\n3:50:43.340 --> 3:50:45.500\n at the origin of life, the origin of intelligence\n\n3:50:45.500 --> 3:50:46.420\n and the origin of this.\n\n3:50:46.420 --> 3:50:48.340\n And I, when I discussed with Yasha,\n\n3:50:48.340 --> 3:50:51.300\n I think Yasha, he was saying, well, the universe,\n\n3:50:51.300 --> 3:50:53.300\n of course the universe is a Turing machine.\n\n3:50:53.300 --> 3:50:56.260\n Of course there's a hyper computer there.\n\n3:50:56.260 --> 3:50:59.860\n And I think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms\n\n3:50:59.860 --> 3:51:02.220\n because of course it's possible for a Turing machine\n\n3:51:02.220 --> 3:51:04.180\n or computers to exist in the universe.\n\n3:51:04.180 --> 3:51:05.460\n We have them.\n\n3:51:05.460 --> 3:51:07.740\n But what I'm trying to understand is\n\n3:51:07.740 --> 3:51:11.340\n where did the transition of continuous discrete occur?\n\n3:51:11.340 --> 3:51:14.900\n And I've been, and this is because of my general foolishness\n\n3:51:14.900 --> 3:51:19.500\n of understanding the continuous.\n\n3:51:19.500 --> 3:51:23.540\n But I guess what I'm trying to say is\n\n3:51:23.540 --> 3:51:26.740\n there were constructors before there were abstractors\n\n3:51:26.740 --> 3:51:31.500\n because how did the universe abstract itself into existence?\n\n3:51:31.500 --> 3:51:32.780\n And it goes back to earlier saying,\n\n3:51:32.780 --> 3:51:35.220\n could the universe of intelligence have come first?\n\n3:51:35.220 --> 3:51:37.260\n What's a constructor, what's an abstractor?\n\n3:51:37.260 --> 3:51:40.580\n So the abstractor is the ability of say,\n\n3:51:40.580 --> 3:51:45.100\n of Alan Turing and G\u00f6del and Church\n\n3:51:45.100 --> 3:51:50.100\n to think about the mathematical universe and to label things.\n\n3:51:50.740 --> 3:51:54.460\n And then from those labels to come up with a set of axioms\n\n3:51:54.460 --> 3:51:57.620\n with those labels and to basically understand\n\n3:51:57.620 --> 3:51:59.580\n the universe mathematically and say, okay,\n\n3:51:59.580 --> 3:52:01.180\n I can label things.\n\n3:52:01.180 --> 3:52:03.140\n Where did the labeler come from?\n\n3:52:03.140 --> 3:52:04.700\n Where is the prime labeler?\n\n3:52:04.700 --> 3:52:09.700\n Even if the universe is not a Turing computer,\n\n3:52:12.060 --> 3:52:14.060\n does that negate the possibility\n\n3:52:14.060 --> 3:52:16.740\n that a Turing computer can simulate the universe?\n\n3:52:16.740 --> 3:52:19.900\n Just because the abstraction was formed at a later time,\n\n3:52:20.980 --> 3:52:22.660\n does that mean that abstraction,\n\n3:52:22.660 --> 3:52:25.260\n this is to our cellular automata conversation.\n\n3:52:25.260 --> 3:52:26.660\n You were taking away some of the magic\n\n3:52:26.660 --> 3:52:29.380\n from the cellular automata because very intelligent\n\n3:52:29.380 --> 3:52:32.380\n biological systems came up with that cellular automata.\n\n3:52:32.380 --> 3:52:34.380\n Well, this is where the existence is the default, right?\n\n3:52:34.380 --> 3:52:36.260\n Is it, does the fact that we exist\n\n3:52:36.260 --> 3:52:38.100\n and we can come up with a Turing machine,\n\n3:52:38.100 --> 3:52:40.100\n does that mean the universe has to be\n\n3:52:40.100 --> 3:52:41.980\n a Turing machine as well?\n\n3:52:41.980 --> 3:52:44.020\n But can it be a Turing machine though?\n\n3:52:44.020 --> 3:52:46.900\n That's a, so the has to be and the can it be.\n\n3:52:46.900 --> 3:52:47.860\n Can it be?\n\n3:52:47.860 --> 3:52:48.740\n Sure.\n\n3:52:50.300 --> 3:52:52.460\n I don't know, I don't understand\n\n3:52:52.460 --> 3:52:54.780\n if it has to be or not, can it be?\n\n3:52:54.780 --> 3:52:57.980\n But can the universe have Turing machines in it?\n\n3:52:57.980 --> 3:53:00.060\n Sure, they exist now.\n\n3:53:01.020 --> 3:53:04.340\n I'm wondering though, maybe,\n\n3:53:04.340 --> 3:53:07.460\n and this is where things get really hairy,\n\n3:53:07.460 --> 3:53:09.420\n is I think the universe maybe in the past\n\n3:53:09.420 --> 3:53:13.540\n did not have the computational power that it has now.\n\n3:53:17.900 --> 3:53:21.540\n This is almost like a law of physics kind of,\n\n3:53:21.540 --> 3:53:24.300\n so the computational power is not,\n\n3:53:24.300 --> 3:53:28.660\n you can get some free lunch.\n\n3:53:28.660 --> 3:53:30.620\n Yeah, I mean, the fact that we now,\n\n3:53:30.620 --> 3:53:32.300\n we sit here in this period in time\n\n3:53:32.300 --> 3:53:33.940\n and we can imagine all these robots\n\n3:53:33.940 --> 3:53:36.020\n and all these machines and we built them.\n\n3:53:36.020 --> 3:53:38.260\n And so we can easily imagine going back in time\n\n3:53:38.260 --> 3:53:39.740\n that the universe was capable of having them,\n\n3:53:39.740 --> 3:53:41.900\n but I don't think it can.\n\n3:53:41.900 --> 3:53:45.220\n So the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally.\n\n3:53:45.220 --> 3:53:46.780\n And I think that's why,\n\n3:53:46.780 --> 3:53:48.500\n I don't want to go back to the time discussion,\n\n3:53:48.500 --> 3:53:50.740\n but I think it has some relationship with it.\n\n3:53:50.740 --> 3:53:53.420\n The universe is basically smarter now than it used to be\n\n3:53:53.420 --> 3:53:57.020\n and it's going to continue getting smarter over time\n\n3:53:57.020 --> 3:53:59.380\n because of novelty, generation,\n\n3:53:59.380 --> 3:54:00.940\n and the ability to create objects\n\n3:54:00.940 --> 3:54:02.420\n within objects within objects.\n\n3:54:02.420 --> 3:54:05.220\n You know, there's a, perhaps it's grounded in physics,\n\n3:54:05.220 --> 3:54:07.900\n there's this intuition of conservation.\n\n3:54:07.900 --> 3:54:09.180\n Yeah. That stuff is conserved.\n\n3:54:09.180 --> 3:54:12.420\n Like you're not, you've always had all,\n\n3:54:12.420 --> 3:54:15.220\n everything, you're just rearranging books\n\n3:54:15.220 --> 3:54:18.500\n on the bookshelf through time.\n\n3:54:18.500 --> 3:54:19.940\n So, okay. But you're saying like\n\n3:54:19.940 --> 3:54:21.660\n new books are being written.\n\n3:54:21.660 --> 3:54:22.980\n Which laws do you want to break?\n\n3:54:22.980 --> 3:54:25.900\n At the origin of the big bang,\n\n3:54:25.900 --> 3:54:27.340\n you had to break the second law\n\n3:54:27.340 --> 3:54:28.500\n because we got order for free.\n\n3:54:28.500 --> 3:54:29.540\n Yeah.\n\n3:54:29.540 --> 3:54:30.380\n Well, what I'm telling you now\n\n3:54:30.380 --> 3:54:33.420\n is that the energy isn't conserved in the universe.\n\n3:54:33.420 --> 3:54:35.460\n Oh, it's the second law. Okay. I got you.\n\n3:54:35.460 --> 3:54:38.020\n So because, but not in a mad way.\n\n3:54:38.020 --> 3:54:43.020\n Okay. So computation potentially is not conserved,\n\n3:54:44.660 --> 3:54:46.460\n which is a fascinating idea.\n\n3:54:46.460 --> 3:54:49.220\n Intelligence is not conserved.\n\n3:54:49.220 --> 3:54:52.540\n Complexity is not conserved.\n\n3:54:54.660 --> 3:54:57.420\n I suppose that's deeply connected\n\n3:54:57.420 --> 3:55:00.340\n to time being fundamental.\n\n3:55:01.180 --> 3:55:03.180\n The natural consequence of that\n\n3:55:03.180 --> 3:55:05.300\n is if time is fundamental\n\n3:55:05.300 --> 3:55:09.660\n and the universe is inflating in time, if you like,\n\n3:55:09.660 --> 3:55:11.860\n then there are one or two conservation laws\n\n3:55:11.860 --> 3:55:14.060\n that we need to have a look at.\n\n3:55:14.060 --> 3:55:16.220\n And I wonder if that means the total energy\n\n3:55:16.220 --> 3:55:18.980\n of the universe is actually increasing over time.\n\n3:55:18.980 --> 3:55:21.100\n And this may be completely ludicrous,\n\n3:55:21.100 --> 3:55:25.260\n but we do have all this dark energy.\n\n3:55:25.260 --> 3:55:28.060\n We have some anomalies, let's say,\n\n3:55:28.060 --> 3:55:29.380\n dark matter and dark energy.\n\n3:55:29.380 --> 3:55:30.980\n If we don't add them in,\n\n3:55:30.980 --> 3:55:35.420\n galaxies, so dark matter, I think doesn't hold.\n\n3:55:35.420 --> 3:55:36.980\n You need to hold the galaxies together\n\n3:55:36.980 --> 3:55:38.900\n and there's some other observational issues.\n\n3:55:38.900 --> 3:55:40.620\n Could dark energy just be time?\n\n3:55:42.140 --> 3:55:44.500\n So figuring out what dark energy is\n\n3:55:44.500 --> 3:55:47.180\n might give us some deep clues\n\n3:55:47.180 --> 3:55:52.180\n about this, not just time, but the consequences of time.\n\n3:55:53.140 --> 3:55:55.300\n So it could be that, I mean,\n\n3:55:55.300 --> 3:55:57.220\n I'm not saying there's perpetual motions allowed\n\n3:55:57.220 --> 3:55:59.100\n and it's free lunch, but I'm saying\n\n3:55:59.100 --> 3:56:02.860\n if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric\n\n3:56:02.860 --> 3:56:07.580\n and it appears to be, and it's generating novelty\n\n3:56:07.580 --> 3:56:11.380\n and it appears to, couldn't that just be mechanistically\n\n3:56:11.380 --> 3:56:13.500\n how reality works?\n\n3:56:13.500 --> 3:56:18.500\n And therefore I don't really like this idea that the,\n\n3:56:18.700 --> 3:56:21.940\n so I want to live in a deterministic universe\n\n3:56:21.940 --> 3:56:25.180\n that is undetermined, right?\n\n3:56:25.180 --> 3:56:27.580\n The only way I can do that is if time is fundamental.\n\n3:56:28.580 --> 3:56:30.340\n Because otherwise it's all the rest of us,\n\n3:56:30.340 --> 3:56:33.340\n it's just sleight of hand because the physicists will say,\n\n3:56:33.340 --> 3:56:35.340\n yes, everything's deterministic.\n\n3:56:35.340 --> 3:56:38.540\n Newtonian mechanics is deterministic.\n\n3:56:38.540 --> 3:56:40.540\n Quantum mechanics is deterministic.\n\n3:56:40.540 --> 3:56:42.460\n Let's take the Everettian view.\n\n3:56:42.460 --> 3:56:44.060\n And then basically we can just draw out\n\n3:56:44.060 --> 3:56:46.980\n this massive universe branching, but it closes again\n\n3:56:46.980 --> 3:56:48.020\n and we get it all back.\n\n3:56:48.020 --> 3:56:50.940\n And don't worry, your feeling of free will is effective.\n\n3:56:51.980 --> 3:56:53.540\n But what the physicists are actually saying\n\n3:56:53.540 --> 3:56:55.500\n is the entire future is mapped out.\n\n3:56:55.500 --> 3:56:59.180\n And that is clearly problematical.\n\n3:57:00.060 --> 3:57:01.600\n And clearly.\n\n3:57:03.780 --> 3:57:05.100\n That's not so clear.\n\n3:57:05.100 --> 3:57:05.940\n Yeah.\n\n3:57:05.940 --> 3:57:07.860\n It's just problematic.\n\n3:57:07.860 --> 3:57:10.300\n Well, yeah, yeah, so it's.\n\n3:57:10.300 --> 3:57:12.100\n Because that maybe is just the way it is.\n\n3:57:12.100 --> 3:57:14.260\n It's problematic to you, a particular creature\n\n3:57:14.260 --> 3:57:15.100\n along this timeline.\n\n3:57:15.100 --> 3:57:16.540\n I want to reduce the number of beliefs\n\n3:57:16.540 --> 3:57:18.540\n I need to understand the universe.\n\n3:57:18.540 --> 3:57:21.260\n So if time is fundamental, I don't need\n\n3:57:21.260 --> 3:57:24.020\n to have magic order at the beginning,\n\n3:57:24.020 --> 3:57:25.620\n and I don't need a second law.\n\n3:57:25.620 --> 3:57:27.420\n But you do need the magical belief\n\n3:57:27.420 --> 3:57:28.820\n that time is fundamental.\n\n3:57:28.820 --> 3:57:32.220\n Well, I need the observation that I'm seeing\n\n3:57:32.220 --> 3:57:34.420\n to be just how it is all the way down.\n\n3:57:34.420 --> 3:57:36.020\n But the Earth also looks flat\n\n3:57:37.220 --> 3:57:40.820\n if you agree with your observation.\n\n3:57:40.820 --> 3:57:43.460\n So we can't necessarily trust our observation.\n\n3:57:43.460 --> 3:57:44.620\n I know the Earth isn't flat\n\n3:57:44.620 --> 3:57:46.340\n because I can send a satellite into space.\n\n3:57:46.340 --> 3:57:49.020\n No, but now you see, now you're using the tools\n\n3:57:49.020 --> 3:57:51.260\n of science and the technology of science.\n\n3:57:51.260 --> 3:57:53.180\n But I'm saying I'm going to do experiments\n\n3:57:53.180 --> 3:57:55.100\n that start to show.\n\n3:57:55.100 --> 3:57:57.380\n I mean, I think that it's worth.\n\n3:57:57.380 --> 3:58:01.020\n So if you can't, so if I cannot do an experiment\n\n3:58:01.020 --> 3:58:04.620\n or a thought experiment that will test this assumption,\n\n3:58:04.620 --> 3:58:07.740\n then the assumption is without merit really in the end.\n\n3:58:07.740 --> 3:58:09.500\n You know, that's fine.\n\n3:58:09.500 --> 3:58:10.340\n Yeah.\n\n3:58:10.340 --> 3:58:12.300\n That's a beautiful ideal you hold yourself to.\n\n3:58:12.300 --> 3:58:17.300\n That's given that you think deeply in a philosophical way,\n\n3:58:18.740 --> 3:58:21.820\n you think about some of these really important issues\n\n3:58:21.820 --> 3:58:25.900\n and you have theoretical frameworks like assembly theory.\n\n3:58:27.140 --> 3:58:29.980\n It's really nice that you're always grounded\n\n3:58:29.980 --> 3:58:31.340\n with experiment.\n\n3:58:31.340 --> 3:58:32.180\n That's all I have.\n\n3:58:32.180 --> 3:58:33.260\n That's so refreshing.\n\n3:58:33.260 --> 3:58:35.300\n That's so beautifully refreshing.\n\n3:58:35.300 --> 3:58:39.380\n Now that we're holding you to the grounded\n\n3:58:39.380 --> 3:58:42.300\n in an experiment to the harsh truth of reality,\n\n3:58:42.300 --> 3:58:45.220\n let me ask the big ridiculous question.\n\n3:58:45.220 --> 3:58:47.420\n What is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n3:58:47.420 --> 3:58:48.980\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n3:58:48.980 --> 3:58:49.940\n Why?\n\n3:58:49.940 --> 3:58:52.660\n This time is fundamental.\n\n3:58:52.660 --> 3:58:54.020\n It's marching forward.\n\n3:58:54.900 --> 3:58:58.900\n And along this long timeline come along a bunch\n\n3:58:58.900 --> 3:59:03.460\n of descendants of apes that have come up\n\n3:59:03.460 --> 3:59:07.500\n with cellular automata and computers and now computers.\n\n3:59:07.500 --> 3:59:09.780\n Why?\n\n3:59:09.780 --> 3:59:11.820\n I have so many different answers to this question.\n\n3:59:11.820 --> 3:59:13.820\n It depends on what day.\n\n3:59:13.820 --> 3:59:16.060\n I would say that given the way of the conversation\n\n3:59:16.060 --> 3:59:18.500\n we had today, I'd say the meaning,\n\n3:59:18.500 --> 3:59:19.900\n well, we make our own meaning.\n\n3:59:19.900 --> 3:59:20.940\n I think that's fine.\n\n3:59:20.940 --> 3:59:24.700\n But I think the universe wants to explore\n\n3:59:24.700 --> 3:59:27.420\n every possible configuration that it's allowed us\n\n3:59:27.420 --> 3:59:28.620\n to explore.\n\n3:59:28.620 --> 3:59:30.420\n And this goes back to the kind of question\n\n3:59:30.420 --> 3:59:33.300\n that you were asking about Yasha and the existence\n\n3:59:33.300 --> 3:59:35.220\n and non existence of things, right?\n\n3:59:35.220 --> 3:59:37.540\n So if the universe is a Turing machine is churning\n\n3:59:37.540 --> 3:59:41.020\n through a lot of states and you think about\n\n3:59:41.020 --> 3:59:43.100\n combinatorial theory before assembly theory,\n\n3:59:43.100 --> 3:59:45.260\n so everything is possible.\n\n3:59:45.260 --> 3:59:48.020\n What Yasha and I were saying is, well,\n\n3:59:48.020 --> 3:59:49.860\n not everything is possible.\n\n3:59:49.860 --> 3:59:52.020\n We don't see the combinatorial explosion.\n\n3:59:52.020 --> 3:59:53.740\n We see something else.\n\n3:59:53.740 --> 3:59:57.740\n And what we see is evidence of memory.\n\n3:59:57.740 --> 4:00:00.500\n So there clearly seems to be some interference\n\n4:00:00.500 --> 4:00:04.140\n between the combinatorial explosion of things\n\n4:00:04.140 --> 4:00:06.140\n and what the universe allows.\n\n4:00:06.140 --> 4:00:08.220\n And it's like this kind of constructive,\n\n4:00:08.220 --> 4:00:09.780\n destructive interference.\n\n4:00:10.660 --> 4:00:13.620\n So maybe the universe is not just about,\n\n4:00:14.900 --> 4:00:18.220\n it is assembling objects in space and time.\n\n4:00:18.220 --> 4:00:22.140\n And those objects are able to search more space and time.\n\n4:00:22.140 --> 4:00:24.260\n And the universe is just infinitely creative.\n\n4:00:24.260 --> 4:00:27.300\n And I guess I'm searching for why the universe\n\n4:00:27.300 --> 4:00:28.380\n is infinitely creative.\n\n4:00:28.380 --> 4:00:29.460\n It is infinitely creative.\n\n4:00:29.460 --> 4:00:31.380\n And maybe the meaning is just simply to make\n\n4:00:31.380 --> 4:00:34.780\n as many objects, create as many things as possible.\n\n4:00:34.780 --> 4:00:37.180\n And I see a future of the universe that doesn't result\n\n4:00:37.180 --> 4:00:38.700\n in the heat death of the universe.\n\n4:00:38.700 --> 4:00:41.940\n The universe is gonna extract every ounce\n\n4:00:41.940 --> 4:00:43.820\n of creativity it can out of it,\n\n4:00:43.820 --> 4:00:45.860\n because that's what we see on Earth, right?\n\n4:00:45.860 --> 4:00:49.020\n And if you think that almost like intelligence\n\n4:00:49.020 --> 4:00:52.340\n is not conserved, that maybe creativity isn't either.\n\n4:00:52.340 --> 4:00:56.980\n Maybe like it's an infinite well.\n\n4:00:56.980 --> 4:01:00.420\n So like creativity is ultimately tied to novelty.\n\n4:01:00.420 --> 4:01:03.660\n You're coming up with cool new configurations of things,\n\n4:01:03.660 --> 4:01:06.300\n and maybe that just can continue indefinitely.\n\n4:01:06.300 --> 4:01:09.900\n And this human species that was created along the way\n\n4:01:09.900 --> 4:01:13.340\n is probably just one method,\n\n4:01:13.340 --> 4:01:16.580\n like that's able to ask the universe about itself.\n\n4:01:16.580 --> 4:01:19.460\n It's just one way to explore creativity.\n\n4:01:19.460 --> 4:01:22.660\n Maybe there's other meta levels on top of that.\n\n4:01:22.660 --> 4:01:24.860\n Like obviously, as a collective intelligence\n\n4:01:24.860 --> 4:01:27.940\n will create organisms, maybe there'll be organisms\n\n4:01:27.940 --> 4:01:32.540\n that ask themselves questions about themselves\n\n4:01:33.500 --> 4:01:38.180\n in a deeper, bigger picture way than we humans do.\n\n4:01:38.180 --> 4:01:39.780\n First to ask questions about the humans,\n\n4:01:39.780 --> 4:01:42.900\n and then construct some kind of hybrid systems\n\n4:01:42.900 --> 4:01:45.500\n that ask themselves about the collective aspect.\n\n4:01:45.500 --> 4:01:47.080\n Just like some weird stacking\n\n4:01:47.080 --> 4:01:49.060\n that we can't even imagine yet.\n\n4:01:49.060 --> 4:01:51.060\n And that stacking, I mean, I have discussed this stacking\n\n4:01:51.060 --> 4:01:54.060\n a lot with Sarah Walker, who's a professor of physics\n\n4:01:54.060 --> 4:01:57.420\n and astrobiology at ASU.\n\n4:01:57.420 --> 4:02:02.060\n And we argue about how creative the universe is gonna be,\n\n4:02:02.060 --> 4:02:03.860\n and is it as deterministic as all that?\n\n4:02:03.860 --> 4:02:07.620\n Because I think she's more of a free will thinker,\n\n4:02:07.620 --> 4:02:10.080\n and I'm of a less free will thinker,\n\n4:02:10.080 --> 4:02:12.220\n but I think we're beginning to converge\n\n4:02:12.220 --> 4:02:13.980\n and understanding that.\n\n4:02:13.980 --> 4:02:15.980\n Because there's simply a missing understanding.\n\n4:02:15.980 --> 4:02:19.020\n Right now, we don't understand how the universe,\n\n4:02:19.020 --> 4:02:21.340\n we don't know what rules the universe has\n\n4:02:21.340 --> 4:02:23.460\n to allow the universe to contemplate itself.\n\n4:02:23.460 --> 4:02:25.140\n So asking the meaning of it\n\n4:02:25.140 --> 4:02:27.340\n before we even know what those rules are\n\n4:02:27.340 --> 4:02:30.660\n is premature, but my guess is that it's not meaningless,\n\n4:02:30.660 --> 4:02:32.060\n and it isn't just about that.\n\n4:02:32.060 --> 4:02:33.880\n And there are three levels of meanings.\n\n4:02:33.880 --> 4:02:35.820\n Obviously, the universe wants us to do stuff.\n\n4:02:35.820 --> 4:02:36.900\n We're interacting with each other,\n\n4:02:36.900 --> 4:02:38.540\n so we create meaning in our own society\n\n4:02:38.540 --> 4:02:41.220\n and our own interactions with humanity.\n\n4:02:41.220 --> 4:02:44.460\n But I do think there is something else going on.\n\n4:02:44.460 --> 4:02:47.660\n But because reality is so weird,\n\n4:02:47.660 --> 4:02:49.980\n we're just scratching at that.\n\n4:02:49.980 --> 4:02:52.960\n And I think that we have to make the experiments better.\n\n4:02:52.960 --> 4:02:56.580\n And we have to perhaps join across,\n\n4:02:56.580 --> 4:02:58.620\n not just for the computation lists.\n\n4:02:58.620 --> 4:03:01.140\n And what I tried to do with Yashua is meet him halfway,\n\n4:03:01.140 --> 4:03:03.220\n say, well, what happens if I become a computation list?\n\n4:03:03.220 --> 4:03:04.260\n What do I gain?\n\n4:03:04.260 --> 4:03:05.660\n A lot, it turns out,\n\n4:03:05.660 --> 4:03:08.180\n because I can make Turing machines in the universe.\n\n4:03:08.180 --> 4:03:09.860\n Because on the one hand, I'm making computers\n\n4:03:09.860 --> 4:03:12.020\n which are state machines inspired by Turing.\n\n4:03:12.020 --> 4:03:14.580\n On the other hand, I'm saying they can't exist.\n\n4:03:14.580 --> 4:03:16.940\n Well, clearly, I can't have my cake and eat it,\n\n4:03:16.940 --> 4:03:18.960\n so there's something weird going on there.\n\n4:03:18.960 --> 4:03:21.280\n So then, did the universe have to make a continuous\n\n4:03:21.280 --> 4:03:23.820\n to a discrete transition, or is the universe just discrete?\n\n4:03:23.820 --> 4:03:25.380\n It's probably just discrete.\n\n4:03:25.380 --> 4:03:27.500\n So if it's just discrete, then there are,\n\n4:03:27.500 --> 4:03:31.260\n I will then give Yashua his Turing like property\n\n4:03:31.260 --> 4:03:32.100\n in the universe.\n\n4:03:32.100 --> 4:03:33.620\n But maybe there's something else below it,\n\n4:03:33.620 --> 4:03:36.660\n which is the constructor that constructs a Turing machine\n\n4:03:36.660 --> 4:03:38.700\n that then constructs, you know,\n\n4:03:38.700 --> 4:03:42.920\n it's a bit like you generate a computing system\n\n4:03:42.920 --> 4:03:44.620\n that then is able to build an abstraction\n\n4:03:44.620 --> 4:03:48.520\n that then recognizes it can make a generalizable abstraction\n\n4:03:48.520 --> 4:03:50.780\n because human beings with mathematics\n\n4:03:50.780 --> 4:03:55.200\n have been able to go on and build physical computers.\n\n4:03:55.200 --> 4:03:57.060\n If that makes any sense.\n\n4:03:57.060 --> 4:03:58.100\n And I think that's the meaning.\n\n4:03:58.100 --> 4:04:00.820\n I think that's, you know, as far as we can,\n\n4:04:00.820 --> 4:04:02.400\n the meaning will be further elucidated\n\n4:04:02.400 --> 4:04:03.740\n with further experiments.\n\n4:04:06.780 --> 4:04:08.420\n Well, you mentioned Sarah.\n\n4:04:08.420 --> 4:04:11.420\n I think you and Sarah Walker\n\n4:04:11.420 --> 4:04:14.460\n are just these fascinating human beings.\n\n4:04:14.460 --> 4:04:18.540\n I'm really fortunate to have the opportunity\n\n4:04:18.540 --> 4:04:20.140\n to be in your presence, to study your work,\n\n4:04:20.140 --> 4:04:21.660\n to follow along with your work.\n\n4:04:21.660 --> 4:04:23.720\n I'm a big fan.\n\n4:04:23.720 --> 4:04:25.600\n Like I told you offline,\n\n4:04:25.600 --> 4:04:27.400\n I hope we get a chance to talk again\n\n4:04:27.400 --> 4:04:29.900\n with perhaps just the two of us,\n\n4:04:29.900 --> 4:04:30.840\n but also with Sarah.\n\n4:04:30.840 --> 4:04:35.340\n That's a fascinating dynamic for people who haven't heard.\n\n4:04:35.340 --> 4:04:38.240\n I suppose on Clubhouse is where I heard you guys talk,\n\n4:04:38.240 --> 4:04:39.940\n but you have an incredible dynamic.\n\n4:04:39.940 --> 4:04:43.220\n And I also can't wait to hear you and Yashua talk.\n\n4:04:43.220 --> 4:04:48.180\n So I think if there's some point in this predetermined\n\n4:04:48.180 --> 4:04:54.140\n or yet to be determined future where the three of us,\n\n4:04:54.140 --> 4:04:56.620\n you and Sarah, or the four of us with Yashua\n\n4:04:56.620 --> 4:04:59.340\n could meet and talk would be a beautiful future.\n\n4:04:59.340 --> 4:05:02.140\n And I look forward to most futures,\n\n4:05:02.140 --> 4:05:04.620\n but I look forward to that one in particular.\n\n4:05:04.620 --> 4:05:06.100\n Lee, thank you so much\n\n4:05:06.100 --> 4:05:08.300\n for spending your valuable time with me today.\n\n4:05:08.300 --> 4:05:09.120\n Thanks, Lex.\n\n4:05:09.120 --> 4:05:10.660\n It's been a pleasure.\n\n4:05:10.660 --> 4:05:13.620\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin.\n\n4:05:13.620 --> 4:05:15.120\n To support this podcast,\n\n4:05:15.120 --> 4:05:18.120\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n4:05:18.120 --> 4:05:20.420\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n4:05:20.420 --> 4:05:22.460\n from the math scientist, Rick Sanchez\n\n4:05:22.460 --> 4:05:24.000\n of Rick and Morty fame.\n\n4:05:25.140 --> 4:05:27.540\n To live is to risk it all.\n\n4:05:28.460 --> 4:05:31.860\n Otherwise you're just an inert chunk\n\n4:05:31.860 --> 4:05:34.240\n of randomly assembled molecules\n\n4:05:34.240 --> 4:05:36.880\n drifting wherever the universe blows you.\n\n4:05:36.880 --> 4:05:49.880\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
